of

unseen
by
margaret
wilson
oliphant
i
the
open
door
i
took
the
house
of
brentwood
on
my
return
from
india
in
for
the
temporary
accommodation
of
my
family
until
i
could
find
a
permanent
home
for
them
it
had
many
advantages
which
made
it
peculiarly
appropriate
it
was
within
reach
of
edinburgh
and
my
boy
roland
whose
education
had
been
considerably
neglected
could
go
in
and
out
to
school
which
was
thought
to
be
better
for
him
than
either
leaving
home
altogether
or
staying
there
always
with
a
tutor
the
first
of
these
expedients
would
have
seemed
preferable
to
me
the
second
commended
itself
to
his
mother
the
doctor
like
a
judicious
man
took
the
midway
between
him
on
his
pony
and
let
him
ride
into
the
high
school
every
morning
it
will
do
him
all
the
good
in
the
world
simson
said
when
it
is
bad
weather
there
is
the
his
mother
accepted
this
solution
of
the
difficulty
more
easily
than
i
could
have
hoped
and
our
boy
who
had
never
known
anything
more
invigorating
than
simla
began
to
encounter
the
brisk
breezes
of
the
north
in
the
subdued
severity
of
the
month
of
may
before
the
time
of
the
vacation
in
july
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
begin
to
acquire
something
of
the
brown
and
ruddy
complexion
of
his
schoolfellows
the
english
system
did
not
commend
itself
to
scotland
in
these
days
there
was
no
little
eton
at
fettes
nor
do
i
think
if
there
had
been
that
a
genteel
exotic
of
that
class
would
have
tempted
either
my
wife
or
me
the
lad
was
doubly
precious
to
us
being
the
only
one
left
us
of
many
and
he
was
fragile
in
body
we
believed
and
deeply
sensitive
in
mind
to
keep
him
at
home
and
yet
to
send
him
to
school
to
combine
the
advantages
of
the
two
systems
seemed
to
be
everything
that
could
be
desired
the
two
girls
also
found
at
brentwood
everything
they
wanted
they
were
near
enough
to
edinburgh
to
have
masters
and
lessons
as
many
as
they
required
for
completing
that
education
which
the
young
people
seem
to
require
nowadays
their
mother
married
me
when
she
was
younger
than
agatha
and
i
should
like
to
see
them
improve
upon
their
mother
i
myself
was
then
no
more
than
an
age
at
which
i
see
the
young
fellows
now
groping
about
them
with
no
notion
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
their
lives
however
i
suppose
every
generation
has
a
conceit
of
itself
which
elevates
it
in
its
own
opinion
above
that
which
comes
after
it
brentwood
stands
on
that
fine
and
wealthy
slope
of
country
one
of
the
richest
in
scotland
which
lies
between
the
pentland
hills
and
the
firth
in
clear
weather
you
could
see
the
blue
gleam
like
a
bent
bow
embracing
the
wealthy
fields
and
scattered
houses
of
the
great
estuary
on
one
side
of
you
and
on
the
other
the
blue
heights
not
gigantic
like
those
we
had
been
used
to
but
just
high
enough
for
all
the
glories
of
the
atmosphere
the
play
of
clouds
and
sweet
reflections
which
give
to
a
hilly
country
an
interest
and
a
charm
which
nothing
else
can
emulate
edinburgh
with
its
two
lesser
heights
the
castle
and
the
calton
hill
its
spires
and
towers
piercing
through
the
smoke
and
seat
lying
crouched
behind
like
a
guardian
no
longer
very
needful
taking
his
repose
beside
the
charge
which
is
now
so
to
speak
able
to
take
care
of
itself
without
him
lay
at
our
right
hand
from
the
lawn
and
windows
we
could
see
all
these
varieties
of
landscape
the
color
was
sometimes
a
little
chilly
but
sometimes
also
as
animated
and
full
of
vicissitude
as
a
drama
i
was
never
tired
of
it
its
color
and
freshness
revived
the
eyes
which
had
grown
weary
of
arid
plains
and
blazing
skies
it
was
always
cheery
and
fresh
and
full
of
repose
the
village
of
brentwood
lay
almost
under
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
deep
little
ravine
down
which
a
stream
which
ought
to
have
been
a
lovely
wild
and
frolicsome
little
river
flowed
between
its
rocks
and
trees
the
river
like
so
many
in
that
district
had
however
in
its
earlier
life
been
sacrificed
to
trade
and
was
grimy
with
but
this
did
not
affect
our
pleasure
in
it
so
much
as
i
have
known
it
to
affect
other
streams
perhaps
our
water
was
more
rapid
perhaps
less
clogged
with
dirt
and
refuse
our
side
of
the
dell
was
charmingly
and
clothed
with
fine
trees
through
which
various
paths
wound
down
to
the
and
to
the
village
bridge
which
crossed
the
stream
the
village
lay
in
the
hollow
and
climbed
with
very
prosaic
houses
the
other
side
village
architecture
does
not
flourish
in
scotland
the
blue
slates
and
the
gray
stone
are
sworn
foes
to
the
picturesque
and
though
i
do
not
for
my
own
part
dislike
the
interior
of
an
hewed
and
galleried
church
with
its
little
family
settlements
on
all
sides
the
square
box
outside
with
its
bit
of
a
spire
like
a
handle
to
lift
it
by
is
not
an
improvement
to
the
landscape
still
a
cluster
of
houses
on
differing
elevations
with
scraps
of
garden
coming
in
between
a
hedgerow
with
clothes
laid
out
to
dry
the
opening
of
a
street
with
its
rural
sociability
the
women
at
their
doors
the
slow
wagon
lumbering
along
gives
a
centre
to
the
landscape
it
was
cheerful
to
look
at
and
convenient
in
a
hundred
ways
within
ourselves
we
had
walks
in
plenty
the
glen
being
always
beautiful
in
all
its
phases
whether
the
woods
were
green
in
the
spring
or
ruddy
in
the
autumn
in
the
park
which
surrounded
the
house
were
the
ruins
of
the
former
mansion
of
brentwood
a
much
smaller
and
less
important
house
than
the
solid
georgian
edifice
which
we
inhabited
the
ruins
were
picturesque
however
and
gave
importance
to
the
place
even
we
who
were
but
temporary
tenants
felt
a
vague
pride
in
them
as
if
they
somehow
reflected
a
certain
consequence
upon
ourselves
the
old
building
had
the
remains
of
a
tower
an
indistinguishable
mass
of
with
ivy
and
the
shells
of
walls
attached
to
this
were
half
filled
up
with
soil
i
had
never
examined
it
closely
i
am
ashamed
to
say
there
was
a
large
room
or
what
had
been
a
large
room
with
the
lower
part
of
the
windows
still
existing
on
the
principal
floor
and
underneath
other
windows
which
were
perfect
though
half
filled
up
with
fallen
soil
and
waving
with
a
wild
growth
of
brambles
and
chance
growths
of
all
kinds
this
was
the
oldest
part
of
all
at
a
little
distance
were
some
very
commonplace
and
disjointed
fragments
of
building
one
of
them
suggesting
a
certain
pathos
by
its
very
commonness
and
the
complete
wreck
which
it
showed
this
was
the
end
of
a
low
gable
a
bit
of
gray
wall
all
incrusted
with
lichens
in
which
was
a
common
probably
it
had
been
a
entrance
a
backdoor
or
opening
into
what
are
called
in
scotland
no
offices
remained
to
be
entered
pantry
and
kitchen
had
all
been
swept
out
of
being
but
there
stood
the
open
and
vacant
free
to
all
the
winds
to
the
rabbits
and
every
wild
creature
it
struck
my
eye
the
first
time
i
went
to
brentwood
like
a
melancholy
comment
upon
a
life
that
was
over
a
door
that
led
to
nothing
closed
once
perhaps
with
anxious
care
bolted
and
guarded
now
void
of
any
meaning
it
impressed
me
i
remember
from
the
first
so
perhaps
it
may
be
said
that
my
mind
was
prepared
to
attach
to
it
an
importance
which
nothing
justified
the
summer
was
a
very
happy
period
of
repose
for
us
all
the
warmth
of
indian
suns
was
still
in
our
veins
it
seemed
to
us
that
we
could
never
have
enough
of
the
greenness
the
dewiness
the
freshness
of
the
northern
landscape
even
its
mists
were
pleasant
to
us
taking
all
the
fever
out
of
us
and
pouring
in
vigor
and
refreshment
in
autumn
we
followed
the
fashion
of
the
time
and
went
away
for
change
which
we
did
not
in
the
least
require
it
was
when
the
family
had
settled
down
for
the
winter
when
the
days
were
short
and
dark
and
the
rigorous
reign
of
frost
upon
us
that
the
incidents
occurred
which
alone
could
justify
me
in
intruding
upon
the
world
my
private
affairs
these
incidents
were
however
of
so
curious
a
character
that
i
hope
my
inevitable
references
to
my
own
family
and
pressing
personal
interests
will
meet
with
a
general
pardon
i
was
absent
in
london
when
these
events
began
in
london
an
old
indian
plunges
back
into
the
interests
with
which
all
his
previous
life
has
been
associated
and
meets
old
friends
at
every
step
i
had
been
circulating
among
some
of
these
enjoying
the
return
to
my
former
life
in
shadow
though
i
had
been
so
thankful
in
substance
to
throw
it
aside
and
had
missed
some
of
my
home
letters
what
with
going
down
from
friday
to
monday
to
old
place
in
the
country
and
stopping
on
the
way
back
to
dine
and
sleep
at
and
to
take
a
look
into
stables
which
occupied
another
day
it
is
never
safe
to
miss
letters
in
this
transitory
life
as
the
says
how
can
one
ever
be
certain
what
is
going
to
happen
all
was
well
at
home
i
knew
exactly
i
thought
what
they
would
have
to
say
to
me
weather
has
been
so
fine
that
roland
has
not
once
gone
by
train
and
he
enjoys
the
ride
beyond
papa
be
sure
that
you
forget
anything
but
bring
us
and
a
list
as
long
as
my
arm
dear
girls
and
dearer
mother
i
would
not
for
the
world
have
forgotten
their
commissions
or
lost
their
little
letters
for
all
the
benbows
and
crosses
in
the
world
but
i
was
confident
in
my
and
peacefulness
when
i
got
back
to
my
club
however
three
or
four
letters
were
lying
for
one
upon
some
of
which
i
noticed
the
which
people
and
anxious
people
still
believe
will
influence
the
and
quicken
the
speed
of
the
mails
i
was
about
to
open
one
of
these
when
the
club
porter
brought
me
two
telegrams
one
of
which
he
said
had
arrived
the
night
before
i
opened
as
was
to
be
expected
the
last
first
and
this
was
what
i
read
you
come
or
answer
for
sake
come
he
is
much
this
was
a
thunderbolt
to
fall
upon
a
head
who
had
one
only
son
and
he
the
light
of
his
eyes
the
other
telegram
which
i
opened
with
hands
trembling
so
much
that
i
lost
time
by
my
haste
was
to
much
the
same
purport
better
doctor
afraid
of
calls
for
you
day
and
night
let
nothing
detain
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
look
up
the
to
see
if
there
was
any
way
of
getting
off
sooner
than
by
the
though
i
knew
well
enough
there
was
not
and
then
i
read
the
letters
which
furnished
alas
too
clearly
all
the
details
they
told
me
that
the
boy
had
been
pale
for
some
time
with
a
scared
look
his
mother
had
noticed
it
before
i
left
home
but
would
not
say
anything
to
alarm
me
this
look
had
increased
day
by
day
and
soon
it
was
observed
that
roland
came
home
at
a
wild
gallop
through
the
park
his
pony
panting
and
in
foam
himself
white
as
a
sheet
but
with
the
perspiration
streaming
from
his
forehead
for
a
long
time
he
had
resisted
all
questioning
but
at
length
had
developed
such
strange
changes
of
mood
showing
a
reluctance
to
go
to
school
a
desire
to
be
fetched
in
the
carriage
at
night
which
was
a
ridiculous
piece
of
luxury
an
unwillingness
to
go
out
into
the
grounds
and
nervous
start
at
every
sound
that
his
mother
had
insisted
upon
an
explanation
when
the
boy
our
boy
roland
who
had
never
known
what
fear
was
began
to
talk
to
her
of
voices
he
had
heard
in
the
park
and
shadows
that
had
appeared
to
him
among
the
ruins
my
wife
promptly
put
him
to
bed
and
sent
for
simson
which
of
course
was
the
only
thing
to
do
i
hurried
off
that
evening
as
may
be
supposed
with
an
anxious
heart
how
i
got
through
the
hours
before
the
starting
of
the
train
i
can
not
tell
we
must
all
be
thankful
for
the
quickness
of
the
railway
when
in
anxiety
but
to
have
thrown
myself
into
a
as
soon
as
horses
could
be
put
to
would
have
been
a
relief
i
got
to
edinburgh
very
early
in
the
blackness
of
the
winter
morning
and
scarcely
dared
look
the
man
in
the
face
at
whom
i
gasped
news
my
wife
had
sent
the
brougham
for
me
which
i
concluded
before
the
man
spoke
was
a
bad
sign
his
answer
was
that
stereotyped
answer
which
leaves
the
imagination
so
wildly
free
the
just
the
same
what
might
that
mean
the
horses
seemed
to
me
to
creep
along
the
long
dark
country
road
as
we
dashed
through
the
park
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
moaning
among
the
trees
and
clenched
my
fist
at
him
whoever
he
might
be
with
fury
why
had
the
fool
of
a
woman
at
the
gate
allowed
any
one
to
come
in
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
the
place
if
i
had
not
been
in
such
hot
haste
to
get
home
i
think
i
should
have
stopped
the
carriage
and
got
out
to
see
what
tramp
it
was
that
had
made
an
entrance
and
chosen
my
grounds
of
all
places
in
the
world
when
my
boy
was
ill
to
grumble
and
groan
in
but
i
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
our
slow
pace
here
the
horses
flew
like
lightning
along
the
intervening
path
and
drew
up
at
the
door
all
panting
as
if
they
had
run
a
race
my
wife
stood
waiting
to
receive
me
with
a
pale
face
and
a
candle
in
her
hand
which
made
her
look
paler
still
as
the
wind
blew
the
flame
about
is
sleeping
she
said
in
a
whisper
as
if
her
voice
might
wake
him
and
i
replied
when
i
could
find
my
voice
also
in
a
whisper
as
though
the
jingling
of
the
furniture
and
the
sound
of
their
hoofs
must
not
have
been
more
dangerous
i
stood
on
the
steps
with
her
a
moment
almost
afraid
to
go
in
now
that
i
was
here
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
without
observing
if
i
may
say
so
that
the
horses
were
unwilling
to
turn
round
though
their
stables
lay
that
way
or
that
the
men
were
unwilling
these
things
occurred
to
me
afterwards
though
at
the
moment
i
was
not
capable
of
anything
but
to
ask
questions
and
to
hear
of
the
condition
of
the
boy
i
looked
at
him
from
the
door
of
his
room
for
we
were
afraid
to
go
near
lest
we
should
disturb
that
blessed
sleep
it
looked
like
actual
sleep
not
the
lethargy
into
which
my
wife
told
me
he
would
sometimes
fall
she
told
me
everything
in
the
next
room
which
communicated
with
his
rising
now
and
then
and
going
to
the
door
of
communication
and
in
this
there
was
much
that
was
very
startling
and
confusing
to
the
mind
it
appeared
that
ever
since
the
winter
began
since
it
was
early
dark
and
night
had
fallen
before
his
return
from
school
he
had
been
hearing
voices
among
the
ruins
at
first
only
a
groaning
he
said
at
which
his
pony
was
as
much
alarmed
as
he
was
but
by
degrees
a
voice
the
tears
ran
down
my
cheeks
as
she
described
to
me
how
he
would
start
up
in
the
night
and
cry
out
mother
let
me
in
oh
mother
let
me
in
with
a
pathos
which
rent
her
heart
and
she
sitting
there
all
the
time
only
longing
to
do
everything
his
heart
could
desire
but
though
she
would
try
to
soothe
him
crying
are
at
home
my
darling
i
am
here
you
know
me
your
mother
is
here
he
would
only
stare
at
her
and
after
a
while
spring
up
again
with
the
same
cry
at
other
times
he
would
be
quite
reasonable
she
said
asking
eagerly
when
i
was
coming
but
declaring
that
he
must
go
with
me
as
soon
as
i
did
so
let
them
doctor
thinks
his
nervous
system
must
have
received
a
shock
my
wife
said
henry
can
it
be
that
we
have
pushed
him
on
too
much
with
his
work
a
delicate
boy
like
roland
and
what
is
his
work
in
comparison
with
his
health
even
you
would
think
little
of
honors
or
prizes
if
it
hurt
the
even
i
as
if
i
were
an
inhuman
father
sacrificing
my
child
to
my
ambition
but
i
would
not
increase
her
trouble
by
taking
any
notice
after
awhile
they
persuaded
me
to
lie
down
to
rest
and
to
eat
none
of
which
things
had
been
possible
since
i
received
their
letters
the
mere
fact
of
being
on
the
spot
of
course
in
itself
was
a
great
thing
and
when
i
knew
that
i
could
be
called
in
a
moment
as
soon
as
he
was
awake
and
wanted
me
i
felt
capable
even
in
the
dark
chill
morning
twilight
to
snatch
an
hour
or
sleep
as
it
happened
i
was
so
worn
out
with
the
strain
of
anxiety
and
he
so
quieted
and
consoled
by
knowing
i
had
come
that
i
was
not
disturbed
till
the
afternoon
when
the
twilight
had
again
settled
down
there
was
just
daylight
enough
to
see
his
face
when
i
went
to
him
and
what
a
change
in
a
fortnight
he
was
paler
and
more
worn
i
thought
than
even
in
those
dreadful
days
in
the
plains
before
we
left
india
his
hair
seemed
to
me
to
have
grown
long
and
lank
his
eyes
were
like
blazing
lights
projecting
out
of
his
white
face
he
got
hold
of
my
hand
in
a
cold
and
tremulous
clutch
and
waved
to
everybody
to
go
away
away
even
mother
he
said
this
went
to
her
heart
for
she
did
not
like
that
even
i
should
have
more
of
the
confidence
than
herself
but
my
wife
has
never
been
a
woman
to
think
of
herself
and
she
left
us
alone
they
all
gone
he
said
eagerly
would
not
let
me
speak
the
doctor
treated
me
as
if
i
were
a
fool
you
know
i
am
not
a
fool
yes
my
boy
i
know
but
you
are
ill
and
quiet
is
so
necessary
you
are
not
only
not
a
fool
roland
but
you
are
reasonable
and
understand
when
you
are
ill
you
must
deny
yourself
you
must
not
do
everything
that
you
might
do
being
he
waved
his
thin
hand
with
a
sort
of
indignation
father
i
am
not
ill
he
cried
i
thought
when
you
came
you
would
not
stop
me
you
would
see
the
sense
of
it
what
do
you
think
is
the
matter
with
me
all
of
you
simson
is
well
enough
but
he
is
only
a
doctor
what
do
you
think
is
the
matter
with
me
i
am
no
more
ill
than
you
are
a
doctor
of
course
he
thinks
you
are
ill
the
moment
he
looks
at
you
what
there
for
and
claps
you
into
is
the
best
place
for
you
at
present
my
dear
made
up
my
mind
cried
the
little
fellow
i
would
stand
it
till
you
came
home
i
said
to
myself
i
frighten
mother
and
the
girls
but
now
father
he
cried
half
jumping
out
of
bed
not
illness
a
his
eyes
shone
so
wildly
his
face
was
so
swept
with
strong
feeling
that
my
heart
sank
within
me
it
could
be
nothing
but
fever
that
did
it
and
fever
had
been
so
fatal
i
got
him
into
my
arms
to
put
him
back
into
bed
i
said
humoring
the
poor
child
which
i
knew
was
the
only
way
you
are
going
to
tell
me
this
secret
to
do
any
good
you
know
you
must
be
quite
quiet
and
not
excite
yourself
if
you
excite
yourself
i
must
not
let
you
father
said
the
boy
he
was
quiet
directly
like
a
man
as
if
he
quite
understood
when
i
had
laid
him
back
on
his
pillow
he
looked
up
at
me
with
that
grateful
sweet
look
with
which
children
when
they
are
ill
break
heart
the
water
coming
into
his
eyes
in
his
weakness
was
sure
as
soon
as
you
were
here
you
would
know
what
to
do
he
said
be
sure
my
boy
now
keep
quiet
and
tell
it
all
out
like
a
to
think
i
was
telling
lies
to
my
own
child
for
i
did
it
only
to
humor
him
thinking
poor
little
fellow
his
brain
was
wrong
father
father
there
is
some
one
in
the
park
some
one
that
has
been
badly
my
dear
you
remember
there
is
to
be
no
excitement
well
who
is
this
somebody
and
who
has
been
him
we
will
soon
put
a
stop
to
cried
roland
it
is
not
so
easy
as
you
think
i
know
who
it
is
it
is
just
a
cry
oh
if
you
could
hear
it
it
gets
into
my
head
in
my
sleep
i
heard
it
as
clear
as
clear
and
they
think
that
i
am
dreaming
or
raving
perhaps
the
boy
said
with
a
sort
of
disdainful
smile
this
look
of
his
perplexed
me
it
was
less
like
fever
than
i
thought
you
quite
sure
you
have
not
dreamed
it
roland
i
said
that
he
was
springing
up
again
when
he
suddenly
bethought
himself
and
lay
down
flat
with
the
same
sort
of
smile
on
his
face
pony
heard
it
too
he
said
jumped
as
if
she
had
been
shot
if
i
had
not
grasped
at
the
reins
for
i
was
frightened
father
shame
to
you
my
boy
said
i
though
i
scarcely
knew
why
i
held
to
her
like
a
leech
have
pitched
me
over
her
head
and
never
drew
breath
till
we
were
at
the
door
did
the
pony
dream
it
he
said
with
a
soft
disdain
yet
indulgence
for
my
foolishness
then
he
added
slowly
was
only
a
cry
the
first
time
and
all
the
time
before
you
went
away
i
tell
you
for
it
was
so
wretched
to
be
frightened
i
thought
it
might
be
a
hare
or
a
rabbit
snared
and
i
went
in
the
morning
and
looked
but
there
was
nothing
it
was
after
you
went
i
heard
it
really
first
and
this
is
what
he
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
close
to
me
and
looked
me
in
the
face
mother
let
me
in
oh
mother
let
me
in
as
he
said
the
words
a
mist
came
over
his
face
the
mouth
quivered
the
soft
features
all
melted
and
changed
and
when
he
had
ended
these
pitiful
words
dissolved
in
a
shower
of
heavy
tears
was
it
a
hallucination
was
it
the
fever
of
the
brain
was
it
the
disordered
fancy
caused
by
great
bodily
weakness
how
could
i
tell
i
thought
it
wisest
to
accept
it
as
if
it
were
all
true
is
very
touching
roland
i
said
if
you
had
just
heard
it
father
i
said
to
myself
if
father
heard
it
he
would
do
something
but
mamma
you
know
given
over
to
simson
and
that
a
doctor
and
never
thinks
of
anything
but
clapping
you
into
must
not
blame
simson
for
being
a
doctor
no
said
my
boy
with
delightful
toleration
and
indulgence
no
the
good
of
him
what
for
i
know
that
but
you
you
are
different
you
are
just
father
and
do
something
directly
papa
directly
this
very
i
said
doubt
it
is
some
little
lost
he
gave
me
a
sudden
swift
look
investigating
my
face
as
though
to
see
whether
after
all
this
was
everything
my
eminence
as
came
to
no
more
than
that
then
he
got
hold
of
my
shoulder
clutching
it
with
his
thin
hand
here
he
said
with
a
quiver
in
his
voice
it
living
at
all
dear
boy
how
then
could
you
have
heard
it
i
said
he
turned
away
from
me
with
a
pettish
exclamation
if
you
know
better
than
that
you
want
to
tell
me
it
is
a
ghost
i
said
roland
withdrew
his
hand
his
countenance
assumed
an
aspect
of
great
dignity
and
gravity
a
slight
quiver
remained
about
his
lips
it
was
you
always
said
we
were
not
to
call
names
it
was
something
in
trouble
oh
father
in
terrible
trouble
my
boy
i
said
i
was
at
my
end
it
was
a
child
that
was
lost
or
any
poor
human
creature
but
roland
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
should
know
if
i
was
you
said
the
child
eagerly
is
what
i
always
said
to
myself
father
will
know
oh
papa
papa
to
have
to
face
it
night
after
night
in
such
terrible
terrible
trouble
and
never
to
be
able
to
do
it
any
good
i
want
to
cry
like
a
baby
i
know
but
what
can
i
do
else
out
there
all
by
itself
in
the
ruin
and
nobody
to
help
it
i
bear
it
i
bear
it
cried
my
generous
boy
and
in
his
weakness
he
burst
out
after
many
attempts
to
restrain
it
into
a
great
childish
fit
of
sobbing
and
tears
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
was
in
a
greater
perplexity
in
my
life
and
afterwards
when
i
thought
of
it
there
was
something
comic
in
it
too
it
is
bad
enough
to
find
your
mind
possessed
with
the
conviction
that
he
has
seen
or
heard
a
ghost
but
that
he
should
require
you
to
go
instantly
and
help
that
ghost
was
the
most
bewildering
experience
that
had
ever
come
my
way
i
am
a
sober
man
myself
and
not
superstitious
at
least
any
more
than
everybody
is
superstitious
of
course
i
do
not
believe
in
ghosts
but
i
deny
any
more
than
other
people
that
there
are
stories
which
i
can
not
pretend
to
understand
my
blood
got
a
sort
of
chill
in
my
veins
at
the
idea
that
roland
should
be
a
for
that
generally
means
a
hysterical
temperament
and
weak
health
and
all
that
men
most
hate
and
fear
for
their
children
but
that
i
should
take
up
his
ghost
and
right
its
wrongs
and
save
it
from
its
trouble
was
such
a
mission
as
was
enough
to
confuse
any
man
i
did
my
best
to
console
my
boy
without
giving
any
promise
of
this
astonishing
kind
but
he
was
too
sharp
for
me
he
would
have
none
of
my
caresses
with
sobs
breaking
in
at
intervals
upon
his
voice
and
the
hanging
on
his
eyelids
he
yet
returned
to
the
charge
will
be
there
now
it
will
be
there
all
the
night
oh
think
papa
think
if
it
was
me
i
rest
for
thinking
of
it
he
cried
putting
away
my
hand
you
go
and
help
it
and
mother
can
take
care
of
roland
what
can
i
do
my
boy
opened
his
eyes
which
were
large
with
weakness
and
fever
and
gave
me
a
smile
such
i
think
as
sick
children
only
know
the
secret
of
was
sure
you
would
know
as
soon
as
you
came
i
always
said
father
will
know
and
mother
he
cried
with
a
softening
of
repose
upon
his
face
his
limbs
relaxing
his
form
sinking
with
a
luxurious
ease
in
his
bed
can
come
and
take
care
of
i
called
her
and
saw
him
turn
to
her
with
the
complete
dependence
of
a
child
and
then
i
went
away
and
left
them
as
perplexed
a
man
as
any
in
scotland
i
must
say
however
i
had
this
consolation
that
my
mind
was
greatly
eased
about
roland
he
might
be
under
a
hallucination
but
his
head
was
clear
enough
and
i
did
not
think
him
so
ill
as
everybody
else
did
the
girls
were
astonished
even
at
the
ease
with
which
i
took
it
do
you
think
he
is
they
said
in
a
breath
coming
round
me
laying
hold
of
me
half
so
ill
as
i
expected
i
said
very
bad
at
papa
you
are
a
darling
cried
agatha
kissing
me
and
crying
upon
my
shoulder
while
little
jeanie
who
was
as
pale
as
roland
clasped
both
her
arms
round
mine
and
could
not
speak
at
all
i
knew
nothing
about
it
not
half
so
much
as
simson
but
they
believed
in
me
they
had
a
feeling
that
all
would
go
right
now
god
is
very
good
to
you
when
your
children
look
to
you
like
that
it
makes
one
humble
not
proud
i
was
not
worthy
of
it
and
then
i
recollected
that
i
had
to
act
the
part
of
a
father
to
ghost
which
made
me
almost
laugh
though
i
might
just
as
well
have
cried
it
was
the
strangest
mission
that
ever
was
intrusted
to
mortal
man
it
was
then
i
remembered
suddenly
the
looks
of
the
men
when
they
turned
to
take
the
brougham
to
the
stables
in
the
dark
that
morning
they
had
not
liked
it
and
the
horses
had
not
liked
it
i
remembered
that
even
in
my
anxiety
about
roland
i
had
heard
them
tearing
along
the
avenue
back
to
the
stables
and
had
made
a
memorandum
mentally
that
i
must
speak
of
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
go
to
the
stables
now
and
make
a
few
inquiries
it
is
impossible
to
fathom
the
minds
of
rustics
there
might
be
some
devilry
of
practical
joking
for
anything
i
knew
or
they
might
have
some
interest
in
getting
up
a
bad
reputation
for
the
brentwood
avenue
it
was
getting
dark
by
the
time
i
went
out
and
nobody
who
knows
the
country
will
need
to
be
told
how
black
is
the
darkness
of
a
november
night
under
high
and
i
walked
into
the
heart
of
the
shrubberies
two
or
three
times
not
seeing
a
step
before
me
till
i
came
out
upon
the
broader
where
the
trees
opened
a
little
and
there
was
a
faint
gray
glimmer
of
sky
visible
under
which
the
great
limes
and
elms
stood
darkling
like
ghosts
but
it
grew
black
again
as
i
approached
the
corner
where
the
ruins
lay
both
eyes
and
ears
were
on
the
alert
as
may
be
supposed
but
i
could
see
nothing
in
the
absolute
gloom
and
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
i
heard
nothing
nevertheless
there
came
a
strong
impression
upon
me
that
somebody
was
there
it
is
a
sensation
which
most
people
have
felt
i
have
seen
when
it
has
been
strong
enough
to
awake
me
out
of
sleep
the
sense
of
some
one
looking
at
me
i
suppose
my
imagination
had
been
affected
by
story
and
the
mystery
of
the
darkness
is
always
full
of
suggestions
i
stamped
my
feet
violently
on
the
gravel
to
rouse
myself
and
called
out
sharply
there
nobody
answered
nor
did
i
expect
any
one
to
answer
but
the
impression
had
been
made
i
was
so
foolish
that
i
did
not
like
to
look
back
but
went
sideways
keeping
an
eye
on
the
gloom
behind
it
was
with
great
relief
that
i
spied
the
light
in
the
stables
making
a
sort
of
oasis
in
the
darkness
i
walked
very
quickly
into
the
midst
of
that
lighted
and
cheerful
place
and
thought
the
clank
of
the
pail
one
of
the
pleasantest
sounds
i
had
ever
heard
the
coachman
was
the
head
of
this
little
colony
and
it
was
to
his
house
i
went
to
pursue
my
investigations
he
was
a
native
of
the
district
and
had
taken
care
of
the
place
in
the
absence
of
the
family
for
years
it
was
impossible
but
that
he
must
know
everything
that
was
going
on
and
all
the
traditions
of
the
place
the
men
i
could
see
eyed
me
anxiously
when
i
thus
appeared
at
such
an
hour
among
them
and
followed
me
with
their
eyes
to
house
where
he
lived
alone
with
his
old
wife
their
children
being
all
married
and
out
in
the
world
jarvis
met
me
with
anxious
questions
how
was
the
poor
young
gentleman
but
the
others
knew
i
could
see
by
their
faces
that
not
even
this
was
the
foremost
thing
in
my
mind
ou
ay
be
noises
the
wind
in
the
trees
and
the
water
soughing
down
the
glen
as
for
tramps
cornel
no
little
that
kind
cattle
about
here
and
merran
at
the
a
careful
jarvis
moved
about
with
some
embarrassment
from
one
leg
to
another
as
he
spoke
he
kept
in
the
shade
and
did
not
look
at
me
more
than
he
could
help
evidently
his
mind
was
perturbed
and
he
had
reasons
for
keeping
his
own
counsel
his
wife
sat
by
giving
him
a
quick
look
now
and
then
but
saying
nothing
the
kitchen
was
very
snug
and
warm
and
bright
as
different
as
could
be
from
the
chill
and
mystery
of
the
night
outside
think
you
are
trifling
with
me
jarvis
i
said
cornel
no
me
what
would
i
trifle
for
if
the
deevil
himsel
was
in
the
auld
hoose
i
have
no
interest
in
one
way
or
another
hold
your
peace
cried
his
wife
imperatively
what
am
i
to
hold
my
peace
for
the
cornel
standing
there
asking
thae
questions
saying
if
the
deevil
himsel
telling
ye
hold
your
peace
cried
the
woman
in
great
excitement
november
weather
and
lang
nichts
and
us
that
ken
we
ken
how
daur
ye
name
a
name
that
shouldna
be
spoken
she
threw
down
her
stocking
and
got
up
also
in
great
agitation
tellt
ye
you
never
could
keep
it
no
a
thing
that
will
hide
and
the
haill
toun
kens
as
weel
as
you
or
me
tell
the
cornel
straight
out
or
see
do
it
i
dinna
hold
your
secrets
and
a
secret
that
the
haill
toun
kens
she
snapped
her
fingers
with
an
air
of
large
disdain
as
for
jarvis
ruddy
and
big
as
he
was
he
shrank
to
nothing
before
this
decided
woman
he
repeated
to
her
two
or
three
times
her
own
adjuration
your
peace
then
suddenly
changing
his
tone
cried
out
him
then
confound
ye
wash
my
hands
if
the
ghosts
in
scotland
were
in
the
auld
hoose
is
that
ony
concern
mine
after
this
i
elicited
without
much
difficulty
the
whole
story
in
the
opinion
of
the
jarvises
and
of
everybody
about
the
certainty
that
the
place
was
haunted
was
beyond
all
doubt
as
sandy
and
his
wife
warmed
to
the
tale
one
tripping
up
another
in
their
eagerness
to
tell
everything
it
gradually
developed
as
distinct
a
superstition
as
i
ever
heard
and
not
without
poetry
and
pathos
how
long
it
was
since
the
voice
had
been
heard
first
nobody
could
tell
with
certainty
opinion
was
that
his
father
who
had
been
coachman
at
brentwood
before
him
had
never
heard
anything
about
it
and
that
the
whole
thing
had
arisen
within
the
last
ten
years
since
the
complete
dismantling
of
the
old
house
which
was
a
wonderfully
modern
date
for
a
tale
so
well
authenticated
according
to
these
witnesses
and
to
several
whom
i
questioned
afterwards
and
who
were
all
in
perfect
agreement
it
was
only
in
the
months
of
november
and
december
that
occurred
during
these
months
the
darkest
of
the
year
scarcely
a
night
passed
without
the
recurrence
of
these
inexplicable
cries
nothing
it
was
said
had
ever
been
seen
at
least
nothing
that
could
be
identified
some
people
bolder
or
more
imaginative
than
the
others
had
seen
the
darkness
moving
jarvis
said
with
unconscious
poetry
it
began
when
night
fell
and
continued
at
intervals
till
day
broke
very
often
it
was
only
all
inarticulate
cry
and
moaning
but
sometimes
the
words
which
had
taken
possession
of
my
poor
fancy
had
been
distinctly
audible
mother
let
me
in
the
jarvises
were
not
aware
that
there
had
ever
been
any
investigation
into
it
the
estate
of
brentwood
had
lapsed
into
the
hands
of
a
distant
branch
of
the
family
who
had
lived
but
little
there
and
of
the
many
people
who
had
taken
it
as
i
had
done
few
had
remained
through
two
decembers
and
nobody
had
taken
the
trouble
to
make
a
very
close
examination
into
the
facts
no
jarvis
said
shaking
his
head
no
cornel
wha
wad
set
themsels
up
for
a
to
the
making
a
wark
about
a
ghost
naebody
believes
in
ghosts
it
bid
to
be
the
wind
in
the
trees
the
last
gentleman
said
or
some
the
water
among
the
rocks
he
said
it
was
quite
easy
explained
but
he
gave
up
the
hoose
and
when
you
cam
cornel
we
were
anxious
you
should
never
hear
what
for
should
i
have
spoiled
the
bargain
and
hairmed
the
property
for
you
call
my
life
nothing
i
said
in
the
trouble
of
the
moment
unable
to
restrain
myself
instead
of
telling
this
all
to
me
you
have
told
it
to
him
to
a
delicate
boy
a
child
unable
to
sift
evidence
or
judge
for
himself
a
young
creature
i
was
walking
about
the
room
with
an
anger
all
the
hotter
that
i
felt
it
to
be
most
likely
quite
unjust
my
heart
was
full
of
bitterness
against
the
stolid
retainers
of
a
family
who
were
content
to
risk
other
children
and
comfort
rather
than
let
a
house
be
empty
if
i
had
been
warned
i
might
have
taken
precautions
or
left
the
place
or
sent
roland
away
a
hundred
things
which
now
i
could
not
do
and
here
i
was
with
my
boy
in
a
and
his
life
the
most
precious
life
on
earth
hanging
in
the
balance
dependent
on
whether
or
not
i
could
get
to
the
reason
of
a
commonplace
i
paced
about
in
high
wrath
not
seeing
what
i
was
to
do
for
to
take
roland
away
even
if
he
were
able
to
travel
would
not
settle
his
agitated
mind
and
i
feared
even
that
a
scientific
explanation
of
refracted
sound
or
reverberation
or
any
other
of
the
easy
certainties
with
which
we
elder
men
are
silenced
would
have
very
little
effect
upon
the
boy
said
jarvis
solemnly
bear
me
witness
the
young
gentleman
never
heard
a
word
from
me
no
nor
from
either
groom
or
gardener
gie
ye
my
word
for
that
in
the
first
place
no
a
lad
that
invites
ye
to
talk
there
are
some
that
are
and
some
that
arena
some
will
draw
ye
on
till
tellt
them
the
clatter
of
the
toun
and
ye
ken
and
whiles
mair
but
maister
roland
his
of
his
books
aye
civil
and
kind
and
a
fine
lad
but
no
that
sort
and
ye
see
for
our
interest
cornel
that
you
should
stay
at
brentwood
i
took
it
upon
me
mysel
to
pass
the
word
a
syllable
to
maister
roland
nor
to
the
young
leddies
no
a
the
that
have
little
reason
to
be
out
at
night
ken
little
or
nothing
about
it
and
some
think
it
grand
to
have
a
ghost
so
long
as
no
in
the
way
of
coming
across
it
if
you
had
been
tellt
the
story
to
begin
with
maybe
ye
would
have
thought
so
this
was
true
enough
though
it
did
not
throw
any
light
upon
my
perplexity
if
we
had
heard
of
it
to
start
with
it
is
possible
that
all
the
family
would
have
considered
the
possession
of
a
ghost
a
distinct
advantage
it
is
the
fashion
of
the
times
we
never
think
what
a
risk
it
is
to
play
with
young
imaginations
but
cry
out
in
the
fashionable
jargon
ghost
nothing
else
was
wanted
to
make
it
i
should
not
have
been
above
this
myself
i
should
have
smiled
of
course
at
the
idea
of
the
ghost
at
all
but
then
to
feel
that
it
was
mine
would
have
pleased
my
vanity
oh
yes
i
claim
no
exemption
the
girls
would
have
been
delighted
i
could
fancy
their
eagerness
their
interest
and
excitement
no
if
we
had
been
told
it
would
have
done
no
good
we
should
have
made
the
bargain
all
the
more
eagerly
the
fools
that
we
are
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
investigate
it
i
said
see
what
it
really
is
cornel
said
the
wife
would
investigate
as
ye
call
it
a
thing
that
nobody
believes
in
ye
would
be
the
of
the
as
my
man
you
believe
in
it
i
said
turning
upon
her
hastily
the
woman
was
taken
by
surprise
she
made
a
step
backward
out
of
my
way
cornel
how
ye
frichten
a
body
me
strange
things
in
this
world
an
unlearned
person
doesna
ken
what
to
think
but
the
minister
and
the
gentry
they
just
laugh
in
your
face
inquire
into
the
thing
that
is
not
na
na
we
just
let
it
with
me
jarvis
i
said
hastily
make
an
attempt
at
least
say
nothing
to
the
men
or
to
anybody
come
back
after
dinner
and
make
a
serious
attempt
to
see
what
it
is
if
it
is
anything
if
i
hear
it
which
i
doubt
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
never
rest
till
i
make
it
out
be
ready
for
me
about
ten
cornel
jarvis
said
in
a
faint
voice
i
had
not
been
looking
at
him
in
my
own
preoccupation
but
when
i
did
so
i
found
that
the
greatest
change
had
come
over
the
fat
and
ruddy
coachman
cornel
he
repeated
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
his
ruddy
face
hung
in
flabby
folds
his
knees
knocked
together
his
voice
seemed
half
extinguished
in
his
throat
then
he
began
to
rub
his
hands
and
smile
upon
me
in
a
deprecating
imbecile
way
nothing
i
wouldna
do
to
pleasure
ye
cornel
taking
a
step
further
back
sure
kens
aye
said
i
never
had
to
do
with
a
mair
fair
gentleman
here
jarvis
came
to
a
pause
again
looking
at
me
rubbing
his
hands
i
said
eh
sir
he
went
on
with
the
same
imbecile
yet
insinuating
smile
reflect
that
i
am
no
used
to
my
feet
with
a
horse
atween
my
legs
or
the
reins
in
my
hand
maybe
nae
worse
than
other
men
but
on
fit
cornel
no
the
bogles
but
been
cavalry
ye
see
with
a
little
hoarse
laugh
my
life
to
face
a
thing
ye
dinna
on
your
feet
sir
if
do
it
said
i
tartly
you
cornel
an
difference
in
the
first
place
ye
tramp
about
the
haill
countryside
and
think
naething
of
it
but
a
walk
tires
me
mair
than
a
hunard
drive
and
then
a
gentleman
and
do
your
ain
pleasure
and
no
so
auld
as
me
and
for
your
ain
bairn
ye
see
cornel
and
then
believes
in
it
cornel
and
you
dinna
believe
in
it
the
woman
said
you
come
with
me
i
said
turning
to
her
she
jumped
back
upsetting
her
chair
in
her
bewilderment
with
a
scream
and
then
fell
into
a
sort
of
hysterical
laugh
wouldna
say
but
what
i
would
go
but
what
would
the
folk
say
to
hear
of
cornel
mortimer
with
an
auld
silly
woman
at
his
heels
the
suggestion
made
me
laugh
too
though
i
had
little
inclination
for
it
sorry
you
have
so
little
spirit
jarvis
i
said
must
find
some
one
else
i
jarvis
touched
by
this
began
to
remonstrate
but
i
cut
him
short
my
butler
was
a
soldier
who
had
been
with
me
in
india
and
was
not
supposed
to
fear
anything
man
or
devil
certainly
not
the
former
and
i
felt
that
i
was
losing
time
the
jarvises
were
too
thankful
to
get
rid
of
me
they
attended
me
to
the
door
with
the
most
anxious
courtesies
outside
the
two
grooms
stood
close
by
a
little
confused
by
my
sudden
exit
i
know
if
perhaps
they
had
been
listening
at
least
standing
as
near
as
possible
to
catch
any
scrap
of
the
conversation
i
waved
my
hand
to
them
as
i
went
past
in
answer
to
their
salutations
and
it
was
very
apparent
to
me
that
they
also
were
glad
to
see
me
go
and
it
will
be
thought
very
strange
but
it
would
be
weak
not
to
add
that
i
myself
though
bent
on
the
investigation
i
have
spoken
of
pledged
to
roland
to
carry
it
out
and
feeling
that
my
health
perhaps
his
life
depended
on
the
result
of
my
inquiry
i
felt
the
most
unaccountable
reluctance
to
pass
these
ruins
on
my
way
home
my
curiosity
was
intense
and
yet
it
was
all
my
mind
could
do
to
pull
my
body
along
i
daresay
the
scientific
people
would
describe
it
the
other
way
and
attribute
my
cowardice
to
the
state
of
my
stomach
i
went
on
but
if
i
had
followed
my
impulse
i
should
have
turned
and
bolted
everything
in
me
seemed
to
cry
out
against
it
my
heart
thumped
my
pulses
all
began
like
beating
against
my
ears
and
every
sensitive
part
it
was
very
dark
as
i
have
said
the
old
house
with
its
shapeless
tower
loomed
a
heavy
mass
through
the
darkness
which
was
only
not
entirely
so
solid
as
itself
on
the
other
hand
the
great
dark
cedars
of
which
we
were
so
proud
seemed
to
fill
up
the
night
my
foot
strayed
out
of
the
path
in
my
confusion
and
the
gloom
together
and
i
brought
myself
up
with
a
cry
as
i
felt
myself
knock
against
something
solid
what
was
it
the
contact
with
hard
stone
and
lime
and
prickly
restored
me
a
little
to
myself
only
the
old
gable
i
said
aloud
with
a
little
laugh
to
reassure
myself
the
rough
feeling
of
the
stones
reconciled
me
as
i
groped
about
thus
i
shook
off
my
visionary
folly
what
so
easily
explained
as
that
i
should
have
strayed
from
the
path
in
the
darkness
this
brought
me
back
to
common
existence
as
if
i
had
been
shaken
by
a
wise
hand
out
of
all
the
silliness
of
superstition
how
silly
it
was
after
all
what
did
it
matter
which
path
i
took
i
laughed
again
this
time
with
better
heart
when
suddenly
in
a
moment
the
blood
was
chilled
in
my
veins
a
shiver
stole
along
my
spine
my
faculties
seemed
to
forsake
me
close
by
me
at
my
side
at
my
feet
there
was
a
sigh
no
not
a
groan
not
a
moaning
not
anything
so
tangible
a
perfectly
soft
faint
inarticulate
sigh
i
sprang
back
and
my
heart
stopped
beating
mistaken
no
mistake
was
impossible
i
heard
it
as
clearly
as
i
hear
myself
speak
a
long
soft
weary
sigh
as
if
drawn
to
the
utmost
and
emptying
out
a
load
of
sadness
that
filled
the
breast
to
hear
this
in
the
solitude
in
the
dark
in
the
night
though
it
was
still
early
had
an
effect
which
i
can
not
describe
i
feel
it
now
something
cold
creeping
over
me
up
into
my
hair
and
down
to
my
feet
which
refused
to
move
i
cried
out
with
a
trembling
voice
is
there
as
i
had
done
before
but
there
was
no
reply
i
got
home
i
quite
know
how
but
in
my
mind
there
was
no
longer
any
indifference
as
to
the
thing
whatever
it
was
that
haunted
these
ruins
my
scepticism
disappeared
like
a
mist
i
was
as
firmly
determined
that
there
was
something
as
roland
was
i
did
not
for
a
moment
pretend
to
myself
that
it
was
possible
i
could
be
deceived
there
were
movements
and
noises
which
i
understood
all
about
cracklings
of
small
branches
in
the
frost
and
little
rolls
of
gravel
on
the
path
such
as
have
a
very
eerie
sound
sometimes
and
perplex
you
with
wonder
as
to
who
has
done
it
there
is
no
real
but
i
assure
you
all
these
little
movements
of
nature
affect
you
one
bit
there
is
i
understood
i
did
not
understand
the
sigh
that
was
not
simple
nature
there
was
meaning
in
it
feeling
the
soul
of
a
creature
invisible
this
is
the
thing
that
human
nature
trembles
at
a
creature
invisible
yet
with
sensations
feelings
a
power
somehow
of
expressing
itself
i
had
not
the
same
sense
of
unwillingness
to
turn
my
back
upon
the
scene
of
the
mystery
which
i
had
experienced
in
going
to
the
stables
but
i
almost
ran
home
impelled
by
eagerness
to
get
everything
done
that
had
to
be
done
in
order
to
apply
myself
to
finding
it
out
bagley
was
in
the
hall
as
usual
when
i
went
in
he
was
always
there
in
the
afternoon
always
with
the
appearance
of
perfect
occupation
yet
so
far
as
i
know
never
doing
anything
the
door
was
open
so
that
i
hurried
in
without
any
pause
breathless
but
the
sight
of
his
calm
regard
as
he
came
to
help
me
off
with
my
overcoat
subdued
me
in
a
moment
anything
out
of
the
way
anything
incomprehensible
faded
to
nothing
in
the
presence
of
bagley
you
saw
and
wondered
how
was
made
the
parting
of
his
hair
the
tie
of
his
white
neckcloth
the
fit
of
his
trousers
all
perfect
as
works
of
art
but
you
could
see
how
they
were
done
which
makes
all
the
difference
i
flung
myself
upon
him
so
to
speak
without
waiting
to
note
the
extreme
unlikeness
of
the
man
to
anything
of
the
kind
i
meant
i
said
want
you
to
come
out
with
me
to
watch
for
colonel
he
said
a
gleam
of
pleasure
running
all
over
him
bagley
a
great
deal
worse
i
cried
colonel
at
what
hour
sir
the
man
said
but
then
i
had
not
told
him
what
it
was
it
was
ten
when
we
set
out
all
was
perfectly
quiet
indoors
my
wife
was
with
roland
who
had
been
quite
calm
she
said
and
who
though
no
doubt
the
fever
must
run
its
course
had
been
better
ever
since
i
came
i
told
bagley
to
put
on
a
thick
greatcoat
over
his
evening
coat
and
did
the
same
myself
with
strong
boots
for
the
soil
was
like
a
sponge
or
worse
talking
to
him
i
almost
forgot
what
we
were
going
to
do
it
was
darker
even
than
it
had
been
before
and
bagley
kept
very
close
to
me
as
we
went
along
i
had
a
small
lantern
in
my
hand
which
gave
us
a
partial
guidance
we
had
come
to
the
corner
where
the
path
turns
on
one
side
was
the
which
the
girls
had
taken
possession
of
for
their
a
wonderful
enclosure
surrounded
by
high
hedges
of
holly
three
hundred
years
old
and
more
on
the
other
the
ruins
both
were
black
as
night
but
before
we
got
so
far
there
was
a
little
opening
in
which
we
could
just
discern
the
trees
and
the
lighter
line
of
the
road
i
thought
it
best
to
pause
there
and
take
breath
i
said
is
something
about
these
ruins
i
understand
it
is
there
i
am
going
keep
your
eyes
open
and
your
wits
about
you
be
ready
to
pounce
upon
any
stranger
you
see
anything
man
or
woman
hurt
but
seize
anything
you
said
bagley
with
a
little
tremor
in
his
breath
do
say
things
there
as
is
neither
man
nor
there
was
no
time
for
words
you
game
to
follow
me
my
man
the
question
i
said
bagley
fell
in
without
a
word
and
saluted
i
knew
then
i
had
nothing
to
fear
we
went
so
far
as
i
could
guess
exactly
as
i
had
come
when
i
heard
that
sigh
the
darkness
however
was
so
complete
that
all
marks
as
of
trees
or
paths
disappeared
one
moment
we
felt
our
feet
on
the
gravel
another
sinking
noiselessly
into
the
slippery
grass
that
was
all
i
had
shut
up
my
lantern
not
wishing
to
scare
any
one
whoever
it
might
be
bagley
followed
it
seemed
to
me
exactly
in
my
footsteps
as
i
made
my
way
as
i
supposed
towards
the
mass
of
the
ruined
house
we
seemed
to
take
a
long
time
groping
along
seeking
this
the
squash
of
the
wet
soil
under
our
feet
was
the
only
thing
that
marked
our
progress
after
a
while
i
stood
still
to
see
or
rather
feel
where
we
were
the
darkness
was
very
still
but
no
stiller
than
is
usual
in
a
night
the
sounds
i
have
mentioned
the
crackling
of
twigs
the
roll
of
a
pebble
the
sound
of
some
rustle
in
the
dead
leaves
or
creeping
creature
on
the
grass
were
audible
when
you
listened
all
mysterious
enough
when
your
mind
is
disengaged
but
to
me
cheering
now
as
signs
of
the
livingness
of
nature
even
in
the
death
of
the
frost
as
we
stood
still
there
came
up
from
the
trees
in
the
glen
the
prolonged
hoot
of
an
owl
bagley
started
with
alarm
being
in
a
state
of
general
nervousness
and
not
knowing
what
he
was
afraid
of
but
to
me
the
sound
was
encouraging
and
pleasant
being
so
comprehensible
owl
i
said
under
my
breath
es
colonel
said
bagley
his
teeth
chattering
we
stood
still
about
five
minutes
while
it
broke
into
the
still
brooding
of
the
air
the
sound
widening
out
in
circles
dying
upon
the
darkness
this
sound
which
is
not
a
cheerful
one
made
me
almost
gay
it
was
natural
and
relieved
the
tension
of
the
mind
i
moved
on
with
new
courage
my
nervous
excitement
calming
down
when
all
at
once
quite
suddenly
close
to
us
at
our
feet
there
broke
out
a
cry
i
made
a
spring
backwards
in
the
first
moment
of
surprise
and
horror
and
in
doing
so
came
sharply
against
the
same
rough
masonry
and
brambles
that
had
struck
me
before
this
new
sound
came
upwards
from
the
ground
a
low
moaning
wailing
voice
full
of
suffering
and
pain
the
contrast
between
it
and
the
hoot
of
the
owl
was
indescribable
the
one
with
a
wholesome
wildness
and
naturalness
that
hurt
nobody
the
other
a
sound
that
made
blood
curdle
full
of
human
misery
with
a
great
deal
of
fumbling
for
in
spite
of
everything
i
could
do
to
keep
up
my
courage
my
hands
shook
i
managed
to
remove
the
slide
of
my
lantern
the
light
leaped
out
like
something
living
and
made
the
place
visible
in
a
moment
we
were
what
would
have
been
inside
the
ruined
building
had
anything
remained
but
the
which
i
have
described
it
was
close
to
us
the
vacant
in
it
going
out
straight
into
the
blackness
outside
the
light
showed
the
bit
of
wall
the
ivy
glistening
upon
it
in
clouds
of
dark
green
the
waving
and
below
the
open
door
a
door
that
led
to
nothing
it
was
from
this
the
voice
came
which
died
out
just
as
the
light
flashed
upon
this
strange
scene
there
was
a
silence
and
then
it
broke
forth
again
the
sound
was
so
near
so
penetrating
so
pitiful
that
in
the
nervous
start
i
gave
the
light
fell
out
of
my
hand
as
i
groped
for
it
in
the
dark
my
hand
was
clutched
by
bagley
who
i
think
must
have
dropped
upon
his
knees
but
i
was
too
much
perturbed
myself
to
think
much
of
this
he
clutched
at
me
in
the
confusion
of
his
terror
forgetting
all
his
usual
decorum
sake
what
is
it
sir
he
gasped
if
i
yielded
there
was
evidently
an
end
of
both
of
us
tell
i
said
more
than
you
what
got
to
find
out
up
man
up
i
pulled
him
to
his
feet
you
go
round
and
examine
the
other
side
or
will
you
stay
here
with
the
lantern
bagley
gasped
at
me
with
a
face
of
horror
we
stay
together
colonel
he
said
his
knees
were
trembling
under
him
i
pushed
him
against
the
corner
of
the
wall
and
put
the
light
into
his
hands
fast
till
i
come
back
shake
yourself
together
man
let
nothing
pass
you
i
said
the
voice
was
within
two
or
three
feet
of
us
of
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
i
went
myself
to
the
other
side
of
the
wall
keeping
close
to
it
the
light
shook
in
hand
but
tremulous
though
it
was
shone
out
through
the
vacant
door
one
oblong
block
of
light
marking
all
the
crumbling
corners
and
hanging
masses
of
foliage
was
that
something
dark
huddled
in
a
heap
by
the
side
of
it
i
pushed
forward
across
the
light
in
the
and
fell
upon
it
with
my
hands
but
it
was
only
a
growing
close
against
the
wall
meanwhile
the
sight
of
my
figure
crossing
the
had
brought
nervous
excitement
to
a
height
he
flew
at
me
gripping
my
shoulder
got
him
colonel
got
him
he
cried
with
a
voice
of
sudden
exultation
he
thought
it
was
a
man
and
was
at
once
relieved
but
at
that
moment
the
voice
burst
forth
again
between
us
at
our
feet
more
close
to
us
than
any
separate
being
could
be
he
dropped
off
from
me
and
fell
against
the
wall
his
jaw
dropping
as
if
he
were
dying
i
suppose
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
that
it
was
me
whom
he
had
clutched
i
for
my
part
had
scarcely
more
command
of
myself
i
snatched
the
light
out
of
his
hand
and
flashed
it
all
about
me
wildly
nothing
the
which
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
before
the
heavy
growth
of
the
glistening
ivy
the
brambles
waving
it
was
close
to
my
ears
now
crying
crying
pleading
as
if
for
life
either
i
heard
the
same
words
roland
had
heard
or
else
in
my
excitement
his
imagination
got
possession
of
mine
the
voice
went
on
growing
into
distinct
articulation
but
wavering
about
now
from
one
point
now
from
another
as
if
the
owner
of
it
were
moving
slowly
back
and
forward
mother
and
then
an
outburst
of
wailing
as
my
mind
steadied
getting
accustomed
as
mind
gets
accustomed
to
anything
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
some
uneasy
miserable
creature
was
pacing
up
and
down
before
a
closed
door
sometimes
but
that
must
have
been
excitement
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
like
knocking
and
then
another
burst
mother
mother
all
this
close
close
to
the
space
where
i
was
standing
with
my
lantern
now
before
me
now
behind
me
a
creature
restless
unhappy
moaning
crying
before
the
vacant
which
no
one
could
either
shut
or
open
more
you
hear
it
bagley
do
you
hear
what
it
is
saying
i
cried
stepping
in
through
the
he
was
lying
against
the
wall
his
eyes
glazed
half
dead
with
terror
he
made
a
motion
of
his
lips
as
if
to
answer
me
but
no
sounds
came
then
lifted
his
hand
with
a
curious
imperative
movement
as
if
ordering
me
to
be
silent
and
listen
and
how
long
i
did
so
i
can
not
tell
it
began
to
have
an
interest
an
exciting
hold
upon
me
which
i
could
not
describe
it
seemed
to
call
up
visibly
a
scene
any
one
could
understand
a
something
shut
out
restlessly
wandering
to
and
fro
sometimes
the
voice
dropped
as
if
throwing
itself
down
sometimes
wandered
off
a
few
paces
growing
sharp
and
clear
mother
let
me
in
oh
mother
mother
let
me
in
oh
let
me
in
every
word
was
clear
to
me
no
wonder
the
boy
had
gone
wild
with
pity
i
tried
to
steady
my
mind
upon
roland
upon
his
conviction
that
i
could
do
something
but
my
head
swam
with
the
excitement
even
when
i
partially
overcame
the
terror
at
last
the
words
died
away
and
there
was
a
sound
of
sobs
and
moaning
i
cried
out
the
name
of
god
who
are
you
with
a
kind
of
feeling
in
my
mind
that
to
use
the
name
of
god
was
profane
seeing
that
i
did
not
believe
in
ghosts
or
anything
supernatural
but
i
did
it
all
the
same
and
waited
my
heart
giving
a
leap
of
terror
lest
there
should
be
a
reply
why
this
should
have
been
i
can
not
tell
but
i
had
a
feeling
that
if
there
was
an
answer
it
would
be
more
than
i
could
bear
but
there
was
no
answer
the
moaning
went
on
and
then
as
if
it
had
been
real
the
voice
rose
a
little
higher
again
the
words
recommenced
mother
let
me
in
oh
mother
let
me
in
with
an
expression
that
was
to
hear
if
it
had
been
what
do
i
mean
by
that
i
suppose
i
got
less
alarmed
as
the
thing
went
on
i
began
to
recover
the
use
of
my
senses
i
seemed
to
explain
it
all
to
myself
by
saying
that
this
had
once
happened
that
it
was
a
recollection
of
a
real
scene
why
there
should
have
seemed
something
quite
satisfactory
and
composing
in
this
explanation
i
can
not
tell
but
so
it
was
i
began
to
listen
almost
as
if
it
had
been
a
play
forgetting
bagley
who
i
almost
think
had
fainted
leaning
against
the
wall
i
was
startled
out
of
this
strange
spectatorship
that
had
fallen
upon
me
by
the
sudden
rush
of
something
which
made
my
heart
jump
once
more
a
large
black
figure
in
the
waving
its
arms
in
come
in
come
in
it
shouted
out
hoarsely
at
the
top
of
a
deep
bass
voice
and
then
poor
bagley
fell
down
senseless
across
the
threshold
he
was
less
sophisticated
than
i
he
had
not
been
able
to
bear
it
any
longer
i
took
him
for
something
supernatural
as
he
took
me
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
awoke
to
the
necessities
of
the
moment
i
remembered
only
after
that
from
the
time
i
began
to
give
my
attention
to
the
man
i
heard
the
other
voice
no
more
it
was
some
time
before
i
brought
him
to
it
must
have
been
a
strange
scene
the
lantern
making
a
luminous
spot
in
the
darkness
the
white
face
lying
on
the
black
earth
i
over
him
doing
what
i
could
for
him
probably
i
should
have
been
thought
to
be
murdering
him
had
any
one
seen
us
when
at
last
i
succeeded
in
pouring
a
little
brandy
down
his
throat
he
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
wildly
up
he
said
then
recognizing
me
tried
to
struggle
to
his
feet
with
a
faint
your
pardon
i
got
him
home
as
best
i
could
making
him
lean
upon
my
arm
the
great
fellow
was
as
weak
as
a
child
fortunately
he
did
not
for
some
time
remember
what
had
happened
from
the
time
bagley
fell
the
voice
had
stopped
and
all
was
still
got
an
epidemic
in
your
house
colonel
simson
said
to
me
next
morning
the
meaning
of
it
all
your
butler
raving
about
a
voice
this
will
never
do
you
know
and
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
you
are
in
it
i
am
in
it
doctor
i
thought
i
had
better
speak
to
you
of
course
you
are
treating
roland
all
right
but
the
boy
is
not
raving
he
is
as
sane
as
you
or
me
all
sane
as
i
or
you
i
never
thought
the
boy
insane
got
cerebral
excitement
fever
i
know
what
got
something
very
queer
about
the
look
of
your
said
i
put
us
all
to
bed
you
know
you
had
better
listen
and
hear
the
symptoms
in
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
he
listened
to
me
patiently
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
the
story
that
was
clear
but
he
heard
it
all
from
beginning
to
end
dear
fellow
he
said
boy
told
me
just
the
same
an
epidemic
when
one
person
falls
a
victim
to
this
sort
of
thing
as
safe
as
can
be
always
two
or
how
do
you
account
for
it
i
said
account
for
it
a
different
matter
no
accounting
for
the
freaks
our
brains
are
subject
to
if
delusion
if
some
trick
of
the
echoes
or
the
winds
some
phonetic
disturbance
or
other
with
me
and
judge
for
yourself
i
said
upon
this
he
laughed
aloud
then
said
not
such
a
bad
idea
but
it
would
ruin
me
forever
if
it
were
known
that
john
simson
was
it
is
said
i
dart
down
on
us
who
are
unlearned
with
your
phonetic
disturbances
but
you
examine
what
the
thing
really
is
for
fear
of
being
laughed
at
science
not
science
said
the
doctor
thing
has
delusion
on
the
front
of
it
it
is
encouraging
an
unwholesome
tendency
even
to
examine
what
good
could
come
of
it
even
if
i
am
convinced
i
should
have
said
so
yesterday
and
i
want
you
to
be
convinced
or
to
believe
said
i
you
prove
it
to
be
a
delusion
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
one
come
somebody
must
go
with
are
cool
said
the
doctor
disabled
this
poor
fellow
of
yours
and
made
him
on
that
point
a
lunatic
for
life
and
now
you
want
to
disable
me
but
for
once
do
it
to
save
appearance
if
give
me
a
bed
come
over
after
my
last
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
meet
him
at
the
gate
and
that
we
should
visit
the
scene
of
last
occurrences
before
we
came
to
the
house
so
that
nobody
might
be
the
wiser
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
hope
that
the
cause
of
sudden
illness
should
not
somehow
steal
into
the
knowledge
of
the
servants
at
least
and
it
was
better
that
all
should
be
done
as
quietly
as
possible
the
day
seemed
to
me
a
very
long
one
i
had
to
spend
a
certain
part
of
it
with
roland
which
was
a
terrible
ordeal
for
me
for
what
could
i
say
to
the
boy
the
improvement
continued
but
he
was
still
in
a
very
precarious
state
and
the
trembling
vehemence
with
which
he
turned
to
me
when
his
mother
left
the
room
filled
me
with
alarm
he
said
quietly
my
boy
i
am
giving
my
best
attention
to
it
all
is
being
done
that
i
can
do
i
have
not
come
to
any
conclusion
yet
i
am
neglecting
nothing
you
said
i
cried
what
i
could
not
do
was
to
give
his
active
mind
any
encouragement
to
dwell
upon
the
mystery
it
was
a
hard
predicament
for
some
satisfaction
had
to
be
given
him
he
looked
at
me
very
wistfully
with
the
great
blue
eyes
which
shone
so
large
and
brilliant
out
of
his
white
and
worn
face
must
trust
me
i
said
father
father
understands
he
said
to
himself
as
if
to
soothe
some
inward
doubt
i
left
him
as
soon
as
i
could
he
was
about
the
most
precious
thing
i
had
on
earth
and
his
health
my
first
thought
but
yet
somehow
in
the
excitement
of
this
other
subject
i
put
that
aside
and
preferred
not
to
dwell
upon
roland
which
was
the
most
curious
part
of
it
all
that
night
at
eleven
i
met
simson
at
the
gate
he
had
come
by
train
and
i
let
him
in
gently
myself
i
had
been
so
much
absorbed
in
the
coming
experiment
that
i
passed
the
ruins
in
going
to
meet
him
almost
without
thought
if
you
can
understand
that
i
had
my
lantern
and
he
showed
me
a
coil
of
taper
which
he
had
ready
for
use
is
nothing
like
light
he
said
in
his
scoffing
tone
it
was
a
very
still
night
scarcely
a
sound
but
not
so
dark
we
could
keep
the
path
without
difficulty
as
we
went
along
as
we
approached
the
spot
we
could
hear
a
low
moaning
broken
occasionally
by
a
bitter
cry
that
is
your
voice
said
the
doctor
thought
it
must
be
something
of
the
kind
a
poor
brute
caught
in
some
of
these
infernal
traps
of
yours
find
it
among
the
bushes
i
said
nothing
i
felt
no
particular
fear
but
a
triumphant
satisfaction
in
what
was
to
follow
i
led
him
to
the
spot
where
bagley
and
i
had
stood
on
the
previous
night
all
was
silent
as
a
winter
night
could
be
so
silent
that
we
heard
far
off
the
sound
of
the
horses
in
the
stables
the
shutting
of
a
window
at
the
house
simson
lighted
his
taper
and
went
peering
about
poking
into
all
the
corners
we
looked
like
two
conspirators
lying
in
wait
for
some
unfortunate
traveller
but
not
a
sound
broke
the
quiet
the
moaning
had
stopped
before
we
came
up
a
star
or
two
shone
over
us
in
the
sky
looking
down
as
if
surprised
at
our
strange
proceedings
simson
did
nothing
but
utter
subdued
laughs
under
his
breath
thought
as
much
he
said
is
just
the
same
with
tables
and
all
other
kinds
of
ghostly
apparatus
a
presence
stops
everything
when
i
am
present
nothing
ever
comes
off
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
be
necessary
to
stay
here
oh
i
complain
only
when
are
satisfied
am
i
will
not
deny
that
i
was
disappointed
beyond
measure
by
this
result
it
made
me
look
like
a
credulous
fool
it
gave
the
doctor
such
a
pull
over
me
as
nothing
else
could
i
should
point
all
his
morals
for
years
to
come
and
his
materialism
his
scepticism
would
be
increased
beyond
endurance
seems
indeed
i
said
there
is
to
be
no
he
said
laughing
is
what
all
the
mediums
say
no
manifestations
in
consequence
of
the
presence
of
an
his
laugh
sounded
very
uncomfortable
to
me
in
the
silence
and
it
was
now
near
midnight
but
that
laugh
seemed
the
signal
before
it
died
away
the
moaning
we
had
heard
before
was
resumed
it
started
from
some
distance
off
and
came
towards
us
nearer
and
nearer
like
some
one
walking
along
and
moaning
to
himself
there
could
be
no
idea
now
that
it
was
a
hare
caught
in
a
trap
the
approach
was
slow
like
that
of
a
weak
person
with
little
halts
and
pauses
we
heard
it
coming
along
the
grass
straight
towards
the
vacant
simson
had
been
a
little
startled
by
the
first
sound
he
said
hastily
child
has
no
business
to
be
out
so
but
he
felt
as
well
as
i
that
this
was
no
voice
as
it
came
nearer
he
grew
silent
and
going
to
the
with
his
taper
stood
looking
out
towards
the
sound
the
taper
being
unprotected
blew
about
in
the
night
air
though
there
was
scarcely
any
wind
i
threw
the
light
of
my
lantern
steady
and
white
across
the
same
space
it
was
in
a
blaze
of
light
in
the
midst
of
the
blackness
a
little
icy
thrill
had
gone
over
me
at
the
first
sound
but
as
it
came
close
i
confess
that
my
only
feeling
was
satisfaction
the
scoffer
could
scoff
no
more
the
light
touched
his
own
face
and
showed
a
very
perplexed
countenance
if
he
was
afraid
he
concealed
it
with
great
success
but
he
was
perplexed
and
then
all
that
had
happened
on
the
previous
night
was
enacted
once
more
it
fell
strangely
upon
me
with
a
sense
of
repetition
every
cry
every
sob
seemed
the
same
as
before
i
listened
almost
without
any
emotion
at
all
in
my
own
person
thinking
of
its
effect
upon
simson
he
maintained
a
very
bold
front
on
the
whole
all
that
coming
and
going
of
the
voice
was
if
our
ears
could
be
trusted
exactly
in
front
of
the
vacant
blank
blazing
full
of
light
which
caught
and
shone
in
the
glistening
leaves
of
the
great
hollies
at
a
little
distance
not
a
rabbit
could
have
crossed
the
turf
without
being
seen
but
there
was
nothing
after
a
time
simson
with
a
certain
caution
and
bodily
reluctance
as
it
seemed
to
me
went
out
with
his
roll
of
taper
into
this
space
his
figure
showed
against
the
holly
in
full
outline
just
at
this
moment
the
voice
sank
as
was
its
custom
and
seemed
to
fling
itself
down
at
the
door
simson
recoiled
violently
as
if
some
one
had
come
up
against
him
then
turned
and
held
his
taper
low
as
if
examining
something
you
see
anybody
i
cried
in
a
whisper
feeling
the
chill
of
nervous
panic
steal
over
me
at
this
action
nothing
but
a
confounded
he
said
this
i
knew
very
well
to
be
nonsense
for
the
was
on
the
other
side
he
went
about
after
this
round
and
round
poking
his
taper
everywhere
then
returned
to
me
on
the
inner
side
of
the
wall
he
scoffed
no
longer
his
face
was
contracted
and
pale
long
does
this
go
on
he
whispered
to
me
like
a
man
who
does
not
wish
to
interrupt
some
one
who
is
speaking
i
had
become
too
much
perturbed
myself
to
remark
whether
the
successions
and
changes
of
the
voice
were
the
same
as
last
night
it
suddenly
went
out
in
the
air
almost
as
he
was
speaking
with
a
soft
reiterated
sob
dying
away
if
there
had
been
anything
to
be
seen
i
should
have
said
that
the
person
was
at
that
moment
crouching
on
the
ground
close
to
the
door
we
walked
home
very
silent
afterwards
it
was
only
when
we
were
in
sight
of
the
house
that
i
said
do
you
think
of
it
tell
what
to
think
of
it
he
said
quickly
he
took
though
he
was
a
very
temperate
man
not
the
claret
i
was
going
to
offer
him
but
some
brandy
from
the
tray
and
swallowed
it
almost
undiluted
you
i
believe
a
word
of
it
he
said
when
he
had
lighted
his
candle
i
tell
what
to
think
he
turned
round
to
add
when
he
was
upstairs
all
of
this
however
did
me
no
good
with
the
solution
of
my
problem
i
was
to
help
this
weeping
sobbing
thing
which
was
already
to
me
as
distinct
a
personality
as
anything
i
knew
or
what
should
i
say
to
roland
it
was
on
my
heart
that
my
boy
would
die
if
i
could
not
find
some
way
of
helping
this
creature
you
may
be
surprised
that
i
should
speak
of
it
in
this
way
i
did
not
know
if
it
was
man
or
woman
but
i
no
more
doubted
that
it
was
a
soul
in
pain
than
i
doubted
my
own
being
and
it
was
my
business
to
soothe
this
pain
to
deliver
it
if
that
was
possible
was
ever
such
a
task
given
to
an
anxious
father
trembling
for
his
only
boy
i
felt
in
my
heart
fantastic
as
it
may
appear
that
i
must
fulfill
this
somehow
or
part
with
my
child
and
you
may
conceive
that
rather
than
do
that
i
was
ready
to
die
but
even
my
dying
would
not
have
advanced
me
unless
by
bringing
me
into
the
same
world
with
that
seeker
at
the
door
next
morning
simson
was
out
before
breakfast
and
came
in
with
evident
signs
of
the
damp
grass
on
his
boots
and
a
look
of
worry
and
weariness
which
did
not
say
much
for
the
night
he
had
passed
he
improved
a
little
after
breakfast
and
visited
his
two
patients
for
bagley
was
still
an
invalid
i
went
out
with
him
on
his
way
to
the
train
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
about
the
boy
is
going
on
very
well
he
said
are
no
complications
as
yet
but
mind
you
not
a
boy
to
be
trifled
with
mortimer
not
a
word
to
him
about
last
i
had
to
tell
him
then
of
my
last
interview
with
roland
and
of
the
impossible
demand
he
had
made
upon
me
by
which
though
he
tried
to
laugh
he
was
much
discomposed
as
i
could
see
must
just
perjure
ourselves
all
round
he
said
swear
you
exorcised
it
but
the
man
was
too
to
be
satisfied
with
that
frightfully
serious
for
you
mortimer
i
laugh
as
i
should
like
to
i
wish
i
saw
a
way
out
of
it
for
your
sake
by
the
way
he
added
shortly
you
notice
that
on
the
side
was
one
on
the
right
hand
of
the
door
i
noticed
you
made
that
mistake
last
he
cried
with
a
curious
low
laugh
pulling
up
the
collar
of
his
coat
as
though
he
felt
the
cold
no
juniper
there
this
morning
left
or
right
just
go
and
as
he
stepped
into
the
train
a
few
minutes
after
he
looked
back
upon
me
and
beckoned
me
for
a
parting
word
coming
back
he
said
i
think
i
had
any
feeling
about
this
as
i
turned
away
from
that
common
bustle
of
the
railway
which
made
my
private
preoccupations
feel
so
strangely
out
of
date
there
had
been
a
distinct
satisfaction
in
my
mind
before
that
his
scepticism
had
been
so
entirely
defeated
but
the
more
serious
part
of
the
matter
pressed
upon
me
now
i
went
straight
from
the
railway
to
the
manse
which
stood
on
a
little
plateau
on
the
side
of
the
river
opposite
to
the
woods
of
brentwood
the
minister
was
one
of
a
class
which
is
not
so
common
in
scotland
as
it
used
to
be
he
was
a
man
of
good
family
well
educated
in
the
scotch
way
strong
in
philosophy
not
so
strong
in
greek
strongest
of
all
in
experience
a
man
who
had
across
in
the
course
of
his
life
most
people
of
note
that
had
ever
been
in
scotland
and
who
was
said
to
be
very
sound
in
doctrine
without
infringing
the
toleration
with
which
old
men
who
are
good
men
are
generally
endowed
he
was
perhaps
he
did
not
think
so
much
about
the
troublous
problems
of
theology
as
many
of
the
young
men
nor
ask
himself
any
hard
questions
about
the
confession
of
faith
but
he
understood
human
nature
which
is
perhaps
better
he
received
me
with
a
cordial
welcome
away
colonel
mortimer
he
said
all
the
more
glad
to
see
you
that
i
feel
a
good
sign
for
the
boy
doing
well
god
be
praised
and
the
lord
bless
him
and
keep
him
he
has
many
a
poor
prayers
and
that
can
do
nobody
will
need
them
all
moncrieff
i
said
your
counsel
and
i
told
him
the
story
more
than
i
had
told
simson
the
old
clergyman
listened
to
me
with
many
suppressed
exclamations
and
at
the
end
the
water
stood
in
his
eyes
just
beautiful
he
said
do
not
mind
to
have
heard
anything
like
it
as
fine
as
burns
when
he
wished
deliverance
to
one
that
is
prayed
for
in
no
kirk
ay
ay
so
he
would
have
you
console
the
poor
lost
spirit
god
bless
the
boy
something
more
than
common
in
that
colonel
mortimer
and
also
the
faith
of
him
in
his
father
i
would
like
to
put
that
into
a
then
the
old
gentleman
gave
me
an
alarmed
look
and
said
no
i
was
not
meaning
a
sermon
but
i
must
write
it
down
for
the
i
saw
the
thought
that
passed
through
his
mind
either
he
thought
or
he
feared
i
would
think
of
a
funeral
sermon
you
may
believe
this
did
not
make
me
more
cheerful
i
can
scarcely
say
that
moncrieff
gave
me
any
advice
how
could
any
one
advise
on
such
a
subject
but
he
said
think
come
too
an
old
man
less
liable
to
be
frightened
than
those
that
are
further
off
the
world
unseen
it
behooves
me
to
think
of
my
own
journey
there
no
beliefs
on
the
subject
come
too
and
maybe
at
the
moment
the
lord
will
put
into
our
heads
what
to
this
gave
me
a
little
comfort
more
than
simson
had
given
me
to
be
clear
about
the
cause
of
it
was
not
my
grand
desire
it
was
another
thing
that
was
in
my
mind
my
boy
as
for
the
poor
soul
at
the
open
door
i
had
no
more
doubt
as
i
have
said
of
its
existence
than
i
had
of
my
own
it
was
no
ghost
to
me
i
knew
the
creature
and
it
was
in
trouble
that
was
my
feeling
about
it
as
it
was
to
hear
it
first
was
a
great
shock
to
my
nerves
but
not
now
a
man
will
get
accustomed
to
anything
but
to
do
something
for
it
was
the
great
problem
how
was
i
to
be
serviceable
to
a
being
that
was
invisible
that
was
mortal
no
longer
at
the
moment
the
lord
will
put
it
into
our
this
is
very
phraseology
and
a
week
before
most
likely
i
should
have
smiled
though
always
with
kindness
at
credulity
but
there
was
a
great
comfort
whether
rational
or
otherwise
i
can
not
say
in
the
mere
sound
of
the
words
the
road
to
the
station
and
the
village
lay
through
the
glen
not
by
the
ruins
but
though
the
sunshine
and
the
fresh
air
and
the
beauty
of
the
trees
and
the
sound
of
the
water
were
all
very
soothing
to
the
spirits
my
mind
was
so
full
of
my
own
subject
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
turning
to
the
right
hand
as
i
got
to
the
top
of
the
glen
and
going
straight
to
the
place
which
i
may
call
the
scene
of
all
my
thoughts
it
was
lying
full
in
the
sunshine
like
all
the
rest
of
the
world
the
ruined
gable
looked
due
east
and
in
the
present
aspect
of
the
sun
the
light
streamed
down
through
the
as
our
lantern
had
done
throwing
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
damp
grass
beyond
there
was
a
strange
suggestion
in
the
open
door
so
futile
a
kind
of
emblem
of
vanity
all
free
around
so
that
you
could
go
where
you
pleased
and
yet
that
semblance
of
an
enclosure
that
way
of
entrance
unnecessary
leading
to
nothing
and
why
any
creature
should
pray
and
weep
to
get
in
to
nothing
or
be
kept
out
by
nothing
you
could
not
dwell
upon
it
or
it
made
your
brain
go
round
i
remembered
however
what
simson
said
about
the
juniper
with
a
little
smile
on
my
own
mind
as
to
the
inaccuracy
of
recollection
which
even
a
scientific
man
will
be
guilty
of
i
could
see
now
the
light
of
my
lantern
gleaming
upon
the
wet
glistening
surface
of
the
spiky
leaves
at
the
right
hand
and
he
ready
to
go
to
the
stake
for
it
that
it
was
the
left
i
went
round
to
make
sure
and
then
i
saw
what
he
had
said
right
or
left
there
was
no
juniper
at
all
i
was
confounded
by
this
though
it
was
entirely
a
matter
of
detail
nothing
at
all
a
bush
of
brambles
waving
the
grass
growing
up
to
the
very
walls
but
after
all
though
it
gave
me
a
shock
for
a
moment
what
did
that
matter
there
were
marks
as
if
a
number
of
footsteps
had
been
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
door
but
these
might
have
been
our
steps
and
all
was
bright
and
peaceful
and
still
i
poked
about
the
other
ruin
the
larger
ruins
of
the
old
house
for
some
time
as
i
had
done
before
there
were
marks
upon
the
grass
here
and
there
i
could
not
call
them
footsteps
all
about
but
that
told
for
nothing
one
way
or
another
i
had
examined
the
ruined
rooms
closely
the
first
day
they
were
half
filled
up
with
soil
and
withered
brackens
and
bramble
no
refuge
for
any
one
there
it
vexed
me
that
jarvis
should
see
me
coming
from
that
spot
when
he
came
up
to
me
for
his
orders
i
know
whether
my
nocturnal
expeditions
had
got
wind
among
the
servants
but
there
was
a
significant
look
in
his
face
something
in
it
i
felt
was
like
my
own
sensation
when
simson
in
the
midst
of
his
scepticism
was
struck
dumb
jarvis
felt
satisfied
that
his
veracity
had
been
put
beyond
question
i
never
spoke
to
a
servant
of
mine
in
such
a
peremptory
tone
before
i
sent
him
away
a
flea
in
his
lug
as
the
man
described
it
afterwards
interference
of
any
kind
was
intolerable
to
me
at
such
a
moment
but
what
was
strangest
of
all
was
that
i
could
not
face
roland
i
did
not
go
up
to
his
room
as
i
would
have
naturally
done
at
once
this
the
girls
could
not
understand
they
saw
there
was
some
mystery
in
it
has
gone
to
lie
down
agatha
said
has
had
such
a
good
he
wants
you
so
papa
cried
little
jeanie
always
with
her
two
arms
embracing
mine
in
a
pretty
way
she
had
i
was
obliged
to
go
at
last
but
what
could
i
say
i
could
only
kiss
him
and
tell
him
to
keep
still
that
i
was
doing
all
i
could
there
is
something
mystical
about
the
patience
of
a
child
will
come
all
right
it
father
he
said
grant
it
may
i
hope
so
yes
it
will
come
all
perhaps
he
understood
that
in
the
midst
of
my
anxiety
i
could
not
stay
with
him
as
i
should
have
done
otherwise
but
the
girls
were
more
surprised
than
it
is
possible
to
describe
they
looked
at
me
with
wondering
eyes
i
were
ill
papa
and
you
only
stayed
with
me
a
moment
i
should
break
my
heart
said
agatha
but
the
boy
had
a
sympathetic
feeling
he
knew
that
of
my
own
will
i
would
not
have
done
it
i
shut
myself
up
in
the
library
where
i
could
not
rest
but
kept
pacing
up
and
down
like
a
caged
beast
what
could
i
do
and
if
i
could
do
nothing
what
would
become
of
my
boy
these
were
the
questions
that
without
ceasing
pursued
each
other
through
my
mind
simson
came
out
to
dinner
and
when
the
house
was
all
still
and
most
of
the
servants
in
bed
we
went
out
and
met
moncrieff
as
we
had
appointed
at
the
head
of
the
glen
simson
for
his
part
was
disposed
to
scoff
at
the
doctor
there
are
to
be
any
spells
you
know
cut
the
whole
concern
he
said
i
did
not
make
him
any
reply
i
had
not
invited
him
he
could
go
or
come
as
he
pleased
he
was
very
talkative
far
more
so
than
suited
my
humor
as
we
went
on
thing
is
certain
you
know
there
must
be
some
human
agency
he
said
is
all
bosh
about
apparitions
i
never
have
investigated
the
laws
of
sound
to
any
great
extent
and
a
great
deal
in
ventriloquism
that
we
know
much
the
same
to
you
i
said
wish
keep
all
that
to
yourself
simson
it
suit
my
state
of
i
hope
i
know
how
to
respect
idiosyncrasy
he
said
the
very
tone
of
his
voice
irritated
me
beyond
measure
these
scientific
fellows
i
wonder
people
put
up
with
them
as
they
do
when
you
have
no
mind
for
their
confidence
moncrieff
met
us
about
eleven
the
same
time
as
on
the
previous
night
he
was
a
large
man
with
a
venerable
countenance
and
white
hair
old
but
in
full
vigor
and
thinking
less
of
a
cold
night
walk
than
many
a
younger
man
he
had
his
lantern
as
i
had
we
were
fully
provided
with
means
of
lighting
the
place
and
we
were
all
of
us
resolute
men
we
had
a
rapid
consultation
as
we
went
up
and
the
result
was
that
we
divided
to
different
posts
moncrieff
remained
inside
the
wall
if
you
can
call
that
inside
where
there
was
no
wall
but
one
simson
placed
himself
on
the
side
next
the
ruins
so
as
to
intercept
any
communication
with
the
old
house
which
was
what
his
mind
was
fixed
upon
i
was
posted
on
the
other
side
to
say
that
nothing
could
come
near
without
being
seen
was
it
had
been
so
also
on
the
previous
night
now
with
our
three
lights
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
the
whole
place
seemed
illuminated
lantern
which
was
a
large
one
without
any
means
of
shutting
up
an
lantern
with
a
pierced
and
ornamental
top
shone
steadily
the
rays
shooting
out
of
it
upward
into
the
gloom
he
placed
it
on
the
grass
where
the
middle
of
the
room
if
this
had
been
a
room
would
have
been
the
usual
effect
of
the
light
streaming
out
of
the
was
prevented
by
the
illumination
which
simson
and
i
on
either
side
supplied
with
these
differences
everything
seemed
as
on
the
previous
night
and
what
occurred
was
exactly
the
same
with
the
same
air
of
repetition
point
for
point
as
i
had
formerly
remarked
i
declare
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
were
pushed
against
put
aside
by
the
owner
of
the
voice
as
he
paced
up
and
down
in
his
trouble
though
these
are
perfectly
futile
words
seeing
that
the
stream
of
light
from
my
lantern
and
that
from
taper
lay
broad
and
clear
without
a
shadow
without
the
smallest
break
across
the
entire
breadth
of
the
grass
i
had
ceased
even
to
be
alarmed
for
my
part
my
heart
was
rent
with
pity
and
trouble
pity
for
the
poor
suffering
human
creature
that
moaned
and
pleaded
so
and
trouble
for
myself
and
my
boy
god
if
i
could
not
find
any
help
and
what
help
could
i
find
roland
would
die
we
were
all
perfectly
still
till
the
first
outburst
was
exhausted
as
i
knew
by
experience
it
would
be
moncrieff
to
whom
it
was
new
was
quite
motionless
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
as
we
were
in
our
places
my
heart
had
remained
almost
at
its
usual
beating
during
the
voice
i
was
used
to
it
it
did
not
rouse
all
my
pulses
as
it
did
at
first
but
just
as
it
threw
itself
sobbing
at
the
door
i
can
not
use
other
words
there
suddenly
came
something
which
sent
the
blood
coursing
through
my
veins
and
my
heart
into
my
mouth
it
was
a
voice
inside
the
wall
the
voice
i
would
have
been
prepared
for
it
in
any
kind
of
adjuration
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
what
i
heard
it
came
out
with
a
sort
of
stammering
as
if
too
much
moved
for
utterance
willie
oh
god
preserve
us
is
it
you
these
simple
words
had
an
effect
upon
me
that
the
voice
of
the
invisible
creature
had
ceased
to
have
i
thought
the
old
man
whom
i
had
brought
into
this
danger
had
gone
mad
with
terror
i
made
a
dash
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
wall
half
crazed
myself
with
the
thought
he
was
standing
where
i
had
left
him
his
shadow
thrown
vague
and
large
upon
the
grass
by
the
lantern
which
stood
at
his
feet
i
lifted
my
own
light
to
see
his
face
as
i
rushed
forward
he
was
very
pale
his
eyes
wet
and
glistening
his
mouth
quivering
with
parted
lips
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
me
we
that
had
gone
through
this
experience
before
had
crouched
towards
each
other
to
get
a
little
strength
to
bear
it
but
he
was
not
even
aware
that
i
was
there
his
whole
being
seemed
absorbed
in
anxiety
and
tenderness
he
held
out
his
hands
which
trembled
but
it
seemed
to
me
with
eagerness
not
fear
he
went
on
speaking
all
the
time
if
it
is
you
and
you
if
it
is
not
a
delusion
of
satan
willie
lad
why
come
ye
here
frighting
them
that
know
you
not
why
came
ye
not
to
me
he
seemed
to
wait
for
an
answer
when
his
voice
ceased
his
countenance
every
line
moving
continued
to
speak
simson
gave
me
another
terrible
shock
stealing
into
the
open
with
his
light
as
much
as
wildly
curious
as
i
but
the
minister
resumed
without
seeing
simson
speaking
to
some
one
else
his
voice
took
a
tone
of
expostulation
this
right
to
come
here
your
gone
with
your
name
on
her
lips
do
you
think
she
would
ever
close
her
door
on
her
own
lad
do
ye
think
the
lord
will
close
the
door
ye
creature
no
i
forbid
ye
i
forbid
ye
cried
the
old
man
the
sobbing
voice
had
begun
to
resume
its
cries
he
made
a
step
forward
calling
out
the
last
words
in
a
voice
of
command
forbid
ye
cry
out
no
more
to
man
go
home
ye
wandering
spirit
go
home
do
you
hear
me
me
that
christened
ye
that
have
struggled
with
ye
that
have
wrestled
for
ye
with
the
lord
here
the
loud
tones
of
his
voice
sank
into
tenderness
her
too
poor
woman
poor
woman
her
you
are
calling
upon
not
here
find
her
with
the
lord
go
there
and
seek
her
not
here
do
you
hear
me
lad
go
after
her
there
let
you
in
though
late
man
take
heart
if
you
will
lie
and
sob
and
greet
let
it
be
at
gate
and
not
your
poor
ruined
he
stopped
to
get
his
breath
and
the
voice
had
stopped
not
as
it
had
done
before
when
its
time
was
exhausted
and
all
its
repetitions
said
but
with
a
sobbing
catch
in
the
breath
as
if
overruled
then
the
minister
spoke
again
you
hearing
me
will
oh
laddie
liked
the
beggarly
elements
all
your
days
be
done
with
them
now
go
home
to
the
father
the
father
are
you
hearing
me
here
the
old
man
sank
down
upon
his
knees
his
face
raised
upwards
his
hands
held
up
with
a
tremble
in
them
all
white
in
the
light
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
i
resisted
as
long
as
i
could
though
i
can
not
tell
why
then
i
too
dropped
upon
my
knees
simson
all
the
time
stood
in
the
with
an
expression
in
his
face
such
as
words
could
not
tell
his
under
lip
dropped
his
eyes
wild
staring
it
seemed
to
be
to
him
that
image
of
blank
ignorance
and
wonder
that
we
were
praying
all
the
time
the
voice
with
a
low
arrested
sobbing
lay
just
where
he
was
standing
as
i
thought
the
minister
said
take
him
into
thy
everlasting
habitations
the
mother
he
cries
to
is
with
thee
who
can
open
to
him
but
thee
lord
when
is
it
too
late
for
thee
or
what
is
too
hard
for
thee
lord
let
that
woman
there
draw
him
inower
let
her
draw
him
inower
i
sprang
forward
to
catch
something
in
my
arms
that
flung
itself
wildly
within
the
door
the
illusion
was
so
strong
that
i
never
paused
till
i
felt
my
forehead
graze
against
the
wall
and
my
hands
clutch
the
ground
for
there
was
nobody
there
to
save
from
falling
as
in
my
foolishness
i
thought
simson
held
out
his
hand
to
me
to
help
me
up
he
was
trembling
and
cold
his
lower
lip
hanging
his
speech
almost
inarticulate
gone
he
said
stammering
gone
we
leaned
upon
each
other
for
a
moment
trembling
so
much
both
of
us
that
the
whole
scene
trembled
as
if
it
were
going
to
dissolve
and
disappear
and
yet
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
never
forget
it
the
shining
of
the
strange
lights
the
blackness
all
round
the
kneeling
figure
with
all
the
whiteness
of
the
light
concentrated
on
its
white
venerable
head
and
uplifted
hands
a
strange
solemn
stillness
seemed
to
close
all
round
us
by
intervals
a
single
syllable
lord
came
from
the
old
lips
he
saw
none
of
us
nor
thought
of
us
i
never
knew
how
long
we
stood
like
sentinels
guarding
him
at
his
prayers
holding
our
lights
in
a
confused
dazed
way
not
knowing
what
we
did
but
at
last
he
rose
from
his
knees
and
standing
up
at
his
full
height
raised
his
arms
as
the
scotch
manner
is
at
the
end
of
a
religious
service
and
solemnly
gave
the
apostolical
benediction
to
what
to
the
silent
earth
the
dark
woods
the
wide
breathing
atmosphere
for
we
were
but
spectators
gasping
an
amen
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
must
be
the
middle
of
the
night
as
we
all
walked
back
it
was
in
reality
very
late
moncrieff
put
his
arm
into
mine
he
walked
slowly
with
an
air
of
exhaustion
it
was
as
if
we
were
coming
from
a
something
hushed
and
solemnized
the
very
air
there
was
that
sense
of
relief
in
it
which
there
always
is
at
the
end
of
a
and
nature
persistent
never
daunted
came
back
in
all
of
us
as
we
returned
into
the
ways
of
life
we
said
nothing
to
each
other
indeed
for
a
time
but
when
we
got
clear
of
the
trees
and
reached
the
opening
near
the
house
where
we
could
see
the
sky
moncrieff
himself
was
the
first
to
speak
must
be
going
he
said
very
late
afraid
i
will
go
down
the
glen
as
i
not
alone
i
am
going
with
you
i
will
not
oppose
it
i
am
an
old
man
and
agitation
wearies
more
than
work
yes
be
thankful
of
your
arm
colonel
done
me
more
good
turns
than
i
pressed
his
hand
on
my
arm
not
feeling
able
to
speak
but
simson
who
turned
with
us
and
who
had
gone
along
all
this
time
with
his
taper
flaring
in
entire
unconsciousness
came
to
himself
apparently
at
the
sound
of
our
voices
and
put
out
that
wild
little
torch
with
a
quick
movement
as
if
of
shame
me
carry
your
lantern
he
said
is
he
recovered
with
a
spring
and
in
a
moment
from
the
spectator
he
had
been
became
himself
sceptical
and
cynical
should
like
to
ask
you
a
question
he
said
you
believe
in
purgatory
doctor
not
in
the
tenets
of
the
church
so
far
as
i
said
moncrieff
old
man
like
me
is
sometimes
not
very
sure
what
he
believes
there
is
just
one
thing
i
am
certain
of
and
that
is
the
of
i
thought
that
was
in
this
life
i
am
no
theologian
said
the
old
man
again
with
a
tremor
in
him
which
i
could
feel
going
over
all
his
frame
i
saw
a
friend
of
mine
within
the
gates
of
hell
i
would
not
despair
but
his
father
would
take
him
by
the
hand
still
if
he
cried
like
allow
it
is
very
strange
very
strange
i
can
not
see
through
it
that
there
must
be
human
agency
i
feel
sure
doctor
what
made
you
decide
upon
the
person
and
the
name
the
minister
put
out
his
hand
with
the
impatience
which
a
man
might
show
if
he
were
asked
how
he
recognized
his
brother
he
said
in
familiar
speech
then
more
solemnly
should
i
not
recognize
a
person
that
i
know
better
far
better
than
i
know
you
you
saw
the
man
moncrieff
made
no
reply
he
moved
his
hand
again
with
a
little
impatient
movement
and
walked
on
leaning
heavily
on
my
arm
and
we
went
on
for
a
long
time
without
another
word
threading
the
dark
paths
which
were
steep
and
slippery
with
the
damp
of
the
winter
the
air
was
very
still
not
more
than
enough
to
make
a
faint
sighing
in
the
branches
which
mingled
with
the
sound
of
the
water
to
which
we
were
descending
when
we
spoke
again
it
was
about
indifferent
matters
about
the
height
of
the
river
and
the
recent
rains
we
parted
with
the
minister
at
his
own
door
where
his
old
housekeeper
appeared
in
great
perturbation
waiting
for
him
me
minister
the
young
gentleman
will
be
worse
she
cried
from
that
better
god
bless
him
moncrieff
said
i
think
if
simson
had
begun
again
to
me
with
his
questions
i
should
have
pitched
him
over
the
rocks
as
we
returned
up
the
glen
but
he
was
silent
by
a
good
inspiration
and
the
sky
was
clearer
than
it
had
been
for
many
nights
shining
high
over
the
trees
with
here
and
there
a
star
faintly
gleaming
through
the
wilderness
of
dark
and
bare
branches
the
air
as
i
have
said
was
very
soft
in
them
with
a
subdued
and
peaceful
cadence
it
was
real
like
every
natural
sound
and
came
to
us
like
a
hush
of
peace
and
relief
i
thought
there
was
a
sound
in
it
as
of
the
breath
of
a
sleeper
and
it
seemed
clear
to
me
that
roland
must
be
sleeping
satisfied
and
calm
we
went
up
to
his
room
when
we
went
in
there
we
found
the
complete
hush
of
rest
my
wife
looked
up
out
of
a
doze
and
gave
me
a
smile
think
he
is
a
great
deal
better
but
you
are
very
late
she
said
in
a
whisper
shading
the
light
with
her
hand
that
the
doctor
might
see
his
patient
the
boy
had
got
back
something
like
his
own
color
he
woke
as
we
stood
all
round
his
bed
his
eyes
had
the
happy
look
of
childhood
glad
to
shut
again
yet
pleased
with
the
interruption
and
glimmer
of
the
light
i
stooped
over
him
and
kissed
his
forehead
which
was
moist
and
cool
is
well
roland
i
said
he
looked
up
at
me
with
a
glance
of
pleasure
and
took
my
hand
and
laid
his
cheek
upon
it
and
so
went
to
sleep
for
some
nights
after
i
watched
among
the
ruins
spending
all
the
dark
hours
up
to
midnight
patrolling
about
the
bit
of
wall
which
was
associated
with
so
many
emotions
but
i
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
beyond
the
quiet
course
of
nature
nor
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
anything
been
heard
again
moncrieff
gave
me
the
history
of
the
youth
whom
he
never
hesitated
to
name
i
did
not
ask
as
simson
did
how
he
recognized
him
he
had
been
a
prodigal
weak
foolish
easily
imposed
upon
and
away
as
people
say
all
that
we
had
heard
had
passed
actually
in
life
the
doctor
said
the
young
man
had
come
home
thus
a
day
or
two
after
his
mother
died
who
was
no
more
than
the
housekeeper
in
the
old
house
and
distracted
with
the
news
had
thrown
himself
down
at
the
door
and
called
upon
her
to
let
him
in
the
old
man
could
scarcely
speak
of
it
for
tears
to
me
it
seemed
as
if
heaven
help
us
how
little
do
we
know
about
anything
a
scene
like
that
might
impress
itself
somehow
upon
the
hidden
heart
of
nature
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
how
but
the
repetition
had
struck
me
at
the
time
as
in
its
terrible
strangeness
and
incomprehensibility
almost
mechanical
as
if
the
unseen
actor
could
not
exceed
or
vary
but
was
bound
to
the
whole
one
thing
that
struck
me
however
greatly
was
the
likeness
between
the
old
minister
and
my
boy
in
the
manner
of
regarding
these
strange
phenomena
moncrieff
was
not
terrified
as
i
had
been
myself
and
all
the
rest
of
us
it
was
no
as
i
fear
we
all
vulgarly
considered
it
to
him
but
a
poor
creature
whom
he
knew
under
these
conditions
just
as
he
had
known
him
in
the
flesh
having
no
doubt
of
his
identity
and
to
roland
it
was
the
same
this
spirit
in
pain
if
it
was
a
spirit
this
voice
out
of
the
unseen
was
a
poor
in
misery
to
be
succored
and
helped
out
of
his
trouble
to
my
boy
he
spoke
to
me
quite
frankly
about
it
when
he
got
better
knew
father
would
find
out
some
way
he
said
and
this
was
when
he
was
strong
and
well
and
all
idea
that
he
would
turn
hysterical
or
become
a
seer
of
visions
had
happily
passed
away
i
must
add
one
curious
fact
which
does
not
seem
to
me
to
have
any
relation
to
the
above
but
which
simson
made
great
use
of
as
the
human
agency
which
he
was
determined
to
find
somehow
we
had
examined
the
ruins
very
closely
at
the
time
of
these
occurrences
but
afterwards
when
all
was
over
as
we
went
casually
about
them
one
sunday
afternoon
in
the
idleness
of
that
unemployed
day
simson
with
his
stick
penetrated
an
old
window
which
had
been
entirely
blocked
up
with
fallen
soil
he
jumped
down
into
it
in
great
excitement
and
called
me
to
follow
there
we
found
a
little
hole
for
it
was
more
a
hole
than
a
room
entirely
hidden
under
the
ivy
and
ruins
in
which
there
was
a
quantity
of
straw
laid
in
a
corner
as
if
some
one
had
made
a
bed
there
and
some
remains
of
crusts
about
the
floor
some
one
had
lodged
there
and
not
very
long
before
he
made
out
and
that
this
unknown
being
was
the
author
of
all
the
mysterious
sounds
we
heard
he
is
convinced
told
you
it
was
human
agency
he
said
triumphantly
he
forgets
i
suppose
how
he
and
i
stood
with
our
lights
seeing
nothing
while
the
space
between
us
was
audibly
traversed
by
something
that
could
speak
and
sob
and
suffer
there
is
no
argument
with
men
of
this
kind
he
is
ready
to
get
up
a
laugh
against
me
on
this
slender
ground
was
puzzled
myself
i
could
not
make
it
out
but
i
always
felt
convinced
human
agency
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
here
it
is
and
a
clever
fellow
he
must
have
been
the
doctor
says
bagley
left
my
service
as
soon
as
he
got
well
he
assured
me
it
was
no
want
of
respect
but
he
could
not
stand
kind
of
things
and
the
man
was
so
shaken
and
ghastly
that
i
was
glad
to
give
him
a
present
and
let
him
go
for
my
own
part
i
made
a
point
of
staying
out
the
time
two
years
for
which
i
had
taken
brentwood
but
i
did
not
renew
my
tenancy
by
that
time
we
had
settled
and
found
for
ourselves
a
pleasant
home
of
our
own
i
must
add
that
when
the
doctor
defies
me
i
can
always
bring
back
gravity
to
his
countenance
and
a
pause
in
his
railing
when
i
remind
him
of
the
to
me
that
was
a
matter
of
little
importance
i
could
believe
i
was
mistaken
i
did
not
care
about
it
one
way
or
other
but
on
his
mind
the
effect
was
different
the
miserable
voice
the
spirit
in
pain
he
could
think
of
as
the
result
of
ventriloquism
or
reverberation
or
anything
you
please
an
elaborate
prolonged
hoax
executed
somehow
by
the
tramp
that
had
found
a
lodging
in
the
old
tower
but
the
staggered
him
things
have
effects
so
different
on
the
minds
of
different
men
ii
the
portrait
at
the
period
when
the
following
incidents
occurred
i
was
living
with
my
father
at
the
grove
a
large
old
house
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
a
little
town
this
had
been
his
home
for
a
number
of
years
and
i
believe
i
was
born
in
it
it
was
a
kind
of
house
which
notwithstanding
all
the
red
and
white
architecture
known
at
present
by
the
name
of
queen
anne
builders
nowadays
have
forgotten
how
to
build
it
was
straggling
and
irregular
with
wide
passages
wide
staircases
broad
landings
the
rooms
large
but
not
very
lofty
the
arrangements
leaving
much
to
be
desired
with
no
economy
of
space
a
house
belonging
to
a
period
when
land
was
cheap
and
so
far
as
that
was
concerned
there
was
no
occasion
to
economize
though
it
was
so
near
the
town
the
clump
of
trees
in
which
it
was
environed
was
a
veritable
grove
in
the
grounds
in
spring
the
primroses
grew
as
thickly
as
in
the
forest
we
had
a
few
fields
for
the
cows
and
an
excellent
walled
garden
the
place
is
being
pulled
down
at
this
moment
to
make
room
for
more
streets
of
mean
little
houses
the
kind
of
thing
and
not
a
dull
house
of
faded
gentry
which
perhaps
the
neighborhood
requires
the
house
was
dull
and
so
were
we
its
last
inhabitants
and
the
furniture
was
faded
even
a
little
dingy
nothing
to
brag
of
i
do
not
however
intend
to
convey
a
suggestion
that
we
were
faded
gentry
for
that
was
not
the
case
my
father
indeed
was
rich
and
had
no
need
to
spare
any
expense
in
making
his
life
and
his
house
bright
if
he
pleased
but
he
did
not
please
and
i
had
not
been
long
enough
at
home
to
exercise
any
special
influence
of
my
own
it
was
the
only
home
i
had
ever
known
but
except
in
my
earliest
childhood
and
in
my
holidays
as
a
schoolboy
i
had
in
reality
known
but
little
of
it
my
mother
had
died
at
my
birth
or
shortly
after
and
i
had
grown
up
in
the
gravity
and
silence
of
a
house
without
women
in
my
infancy
i
believe
a
sister
of
my
had
lived
with
us
and
taken
charge
of
the
household
and
of
me
but
she
too
had
died
long
long
ago
my
mourning
for
her
being
one
of
the
first
things
i
could
recollect
and
she
had
no
successor
there
were
indeed
a
housekeeper
and
some
maids
the
latter
of
whom
i
only
saw
disappearing
at
the
end
of
a
passage
or
whisking
out
of
a
room
when
one
of
appeared
weir
indeed
i
saw
nearly
every
day
but
a
curtsey
a
smile
a
pair
of
nice
round
arms
which
she
caressed
while
folding
them
across
her
ample
waist
and
a
large
white
apron
were
all
i
knew
of
her
this
was
the
only
female
influence
in
the
house
the
i
was
aware
of
only
as
a
place
of
deadly
good
order
into
which
nobody
ever
entered
it
had
three
long
windows
opening
on
the
lawn
and
communicated
at
the
upper
end
which
was
rounded
like
a
great
bay
with
the
conservatory
sometimes
i
gazed
into
it
as
a
child
from
without
wondering
at
the
needlework
on
the
chairs
the
screens
the
which
never
reflected
any
living
face
my
father
did
not
like
the
room
which
probably
was
not
wonderful
though
it
never
occurred
to
me
in
those
early
days
to
inquire
why
i
may
say
here
though
it
will
probably
be
disappointing
to
those
who
form
a
sentimental
idea
of
the
capabilities
of
children
that
it
did
not
occur
to
me
either
in
these
early
days
to
make
any
inquiry
about
my
mother
there
was
no
room
in
life
as
i
knew
it
for
any
such
person
nothing
suggested
to
my
mind
either
the
fact
that
she
must
have
existed
or
that
there
was
need
of
her
in
the
house
i
accepted
as
i
believe
most
children
do
the
facts
of
existence
on
the
basis
with
which
i
had
first
made
acquaintance
with
them
without
question
or
remark
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
aware
that
it
was
rather
dull
at
home
but
neither
by
comparison
with
the
books
i
read
nor
by
the
communications
received
from
my
did
this
seem
to
me
anything
remarkable
and
i
was
possibly
somewhat
dull
too
by
nature
for
i
did
not
mind
i
was
fond
of
reading
and
for
that
there
was
unbounded
opportunity
i
had
a
little
ambition
in
respect
to
work
and
that
too
could
be
prosecuted
undisturbed
when
i
went
to
the
university
my
society
lay
almost
entirely
among
men
but
by
that
time
and
afterwards
matters
had
of
course
greatly
changed
with
me
and
though
i
recognized
women
as
part
of
the
economy
of
nature
and
did
not
indeed
by
any
means
dislike
or
avoid
them
yet
the
idea
of
connecting
them
at
all
with
my
own
home
never
entered
into
my
head
that
continued
to
be
as
it
had
always
been
when
at
intervals
i
descended
upon
the
cool
grave
colorless
place
in
the
midst
of
my
traffic
with
the
world
always
very
still
serious
the
cooking
very
good
the
comfort
perfect
old
morphew
the
butler
a
little
older
but
very
little
older
perhaps
on
the
whole
less
old
since
in
my
childhood
i
had
thought
him
a
kind
of
methuselah
and
weir
less
active
covering
up
her
arms
in
sleeves
but
folding
and
caressing
them
just
as
always
i
remember
looking
in
from
the
lawn
through
the
windows
upon
that
with
a
humorous
recollection
of
my
childish
admiration
and
wonder
and
feeling
that
it
must
be
kept
so
forever
and
ever
and
that
to
go
into
it
would
break
some
sort
of
amusing
mock
mystery
some
pleasantly
ridiculous
spell
but
it
was
only
at
rare
intervals
that
i
went
home
in
the
long
vacation
as
in
my
school
holidays
my
father
often
went
abroad
with
me
so
that
we
had
gone
over
a
great
deal
of
the
continent
together
very
pleasantly
he
was
old
in
proportion
to
the
age
of
his
son
being
a
man
of
sixty
when
i
was
twenty
but
that
did
not
disturb
the
pleasure
of
the
relations
between
us
i
know
that
they
were
ever
very
confidential
on
my
side
there
was
but
little
to
communicate
for
i
did
not
get
into
scrapes
nor
fall
in
love
the
two
predicaments
which
demand
sympathy
and
confidences
and
as
for
my
father
himself
i
was
never
aware
what
there
could
be
to
communicate
on
his
side
i
knew
his
life
exactly
what
he
did
almost
at
every
hour
of
the
day
under
what
circumstances
of
the
temperature
he
would
ride
and
when
walk
how
often
and
with
what
guests
he
would
indulge
in
the
occasional
break
of
a
a
serious
pleasure
perhaps
indeed
less
a
pleasure
than
a
duty
all
this
i
knew
as
well
as
he
did
and
also
his
views
on
public
matters
his
political
opinions
which
naturally
were
different
from
mine
what
ground
then
remained
for
confidence
i
did
not
know
any
we
were
both
of
us
of
a
reserved
nature
not
apt
to
enter
into
our
religious
feelings
for
instance
there
are
many
people
who
think
reticence
on
such
subjects
a
sign
of
the
most
reverential
way
of
contemplating
them
of
this
i
am
far
from
being
sure
but
at
all
events
it
was
the
practice
most
congenial
to
my
own
mind
and
then
i
was
for
a
long
time
absent
making
my
own
way
in
the
world
i
did
not
make
it
very
successfully
i
accomplished
the
natural
fate
of
an
englishman
and
went
out
to
the
colonies
then
to
india
in
a
position
but
returned
home
after
seven
or
eight
years
invalided
in
bad
health
and
not
much
better
spirits
tired
and
disappointed
with
my
first
trial
of
life
i
had
as
people
say
to
insist
on
making
my
way
my
father
was
rich
and
had
never
given
me
the
slightest
reason
to
believe
that
he
did
not
intend
me
to
be
his
heir
his
allowance
to
me
was
not
illiberal
and
though
he
did
not
oppose
the
carrying
out
of
my
own
plans
he
by
no
means
urged
me
to
exertion
when
i
came
home
he
received
me
very
affectionately
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
in
my
return
course
he
said
am
not
glad
that
you
are
disappointed
philip
or
that
your
health
is
broken
but
otherwise
it
is
an
ill
wind
you
know
that
blows
nobody
good
and
i
am
very
glad
to
have
you
at
home
i
am
growing
an
old
man
see
any
difference
sir
said
i
here
seems
exactly
the
same
as
when
i
went
away
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
is
true
enough
he
said
we
have
reached
a
certain
age
we
seem
to
go
on
for
a
long
time
on
a
plane
and
feel
no
great
difference
from
year
to
year
but
it
is
an
inclined
plane
and
the
longer
we
go
on
the
more
sudden
will
be
the
fall
at
the
end
but
at
all
events
it
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
have
you
i
had
known
that
i
said
that
you
wanted
me
i
should
have
come
in
any
circumstances
as
there
are
only
two
of
us
in
the
world
he
said
are
only
two
of
us
in
the
world
but
still
i
should
not
have
sent
for
you
phil
to
interrupt
your
is
as
well
then
that
it
has
interrupted
itself
i
said
rather
bitterly
for
disappointment
is
hard
to
bear
he
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
and
repeated
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
with
a
look
of
real
pleasure
which
gave
me
a
certain
gratification
too
for
after
all
he
was
an
old
man
and
the
only
one
in
all
the
world
to
whom
i
owed
any
duty
i
had
not
been
without
dreams
of
warmer
affections
but
they
had
come
to
nothing
not
tragically
but
in
the
ordinary
way
i
might
perhaps
have
had
love
which
i
did
not
want
but
not
that
which
i
did
want
which
was
not
a
thing
to
make
any
unmanly
moan
about
but
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
such
disappointments
happen
every
day
indeed
they
are
more
common
than
anything
else
and
sometimes
it
is
apparent
afterwards
that
it
is
better
it
was
so
however
here
i
was
at
thirty
stranded
yet
wanting
for
nothing
in
a
position
to
call
forth
rather
envy
than
pity
from
the
greater
part
of
my
contemporaries
for
i
had
an
assured
and
comfortable
existence
as
much
money
as
i
wanted
and
the
prospect
of
an
excellent
fortune
for
the
future
on
the
other
hand
my
health
was
still
low
and
i
had
no
occupation
the
neighborhood
of
the
town
was
a
drawback
rather
than
an
advantage
i
felt
myself
tempted
instead
of
taking
the
long
walk
into
the
country
which
my
doctor
recommended
to
take
a
much
shorter
one
through
the
high
street
across
the
river
and
back
again
which
was
not
a
walk
but
a
lounge
the
country
was
silent
and
full
of
thoughts
thoughts
not
always
very
agreeable
whereas
there
were
always
the
humors
of
the
little
urban
population
to
glance
at
the
news
to
be
heard
all
those
petty
matters
which
so
often
make
up
life
in
a
very
impoverished
version
for
the
idle
man
i
did
not
like
it
but
i
felt
myself
yielding
to
it
not
having
energy
enough
to
make
a
stand
the
rector
and
the
leading
lawyer
of
the
place
asked
me
to
dinner
i
might
have
glided
into
the
society
such
as
it
was
had
i
been
disposed
for
that
everything
about
me
began
to
close
over
me
as
if
i
had
been
fifty
and
fully
contented
with
my
lot
it
was
possibly
my
own
want
of
occupation
which
made
me
observe
with
surprise
after
a
while
how
much
occupied
my
father
was
he
had
expressed
himself
glad
of
my
return
but
now
that
i
had
returned
i
saw
very
little
of
him
most
of
his
time
was
spent
in
his
library
as
had
always
been
the
case
but
on
the
few
visits
i
paid
him
there
i
could
not
but
perceive
that
the
aspect
of
the
library
was
much
changed
it
had
acquired
the
look
of
a
almost
an
office
there
were
large
books
on
the
table
which
i
could
not
associate
with
anything
he
could
naturally
have
to
do
and
his
correspondence
was
very
large
i
thought
he
closed
one
of
those
books
hurriedly
as
i
came
in
and
pushed
it
away
as
if
he
did
not
wish
me
to
see
it
this
surprised
me
at
the
moment
without
arousing
any
other
feeling
but
afterwards
i
remembered
it
with
a
clearer
sense
of
what
it
meant
he
was
more
absorbed
altogether
than
i
had
been
used
to
see
him
he
was
visited
by
men
sometimes
not
of
very
prepossessing
appearance
surprise
grew
in
my
mind
without
any
very
distinct
idea
of
the
reason
of
it
and
it
was
not
till
after
a
chance
conversation
with
morphew
that
my
vague
uneasiness
began
to
take
definite
shape
it
was
begun
without
any
special
intention
on
my
part
morphew
had
informed
me
that
master
was
very
busy
on
some
occasion
when
i
wanted
to
see
him
and
i
was
a
little
annoyed
to
be
thus
put
off
appears
to
me
that
my
father
is
always
busy
i
said
hastily
morphew
then
began
very
oracularly
to
nod
his
head
in
assent
deal
too
busy
sir
if
you
take
my
opinion
he
said
this
startled
me
much
and
i
asked
hurriedly
do
you
mean
without
reflecting
that
to
ask
for
private
information
from
a
servant
about
my
habits
was
as
bad
as
investigating
into
a
affairs
it
did
not
strike
me
in
the
same
light
philip
said
morphew
thing
as
more
often
than
it
ought
to
master
has
got
awful
keen
about
money
in
his
old
a
new
thing
for
him
i
said
sir
begging
your
pardon
it
a
new
thing
he
was
once
broke
of
it
and
that
easy
done
but
come
back
if
excuse
me
saying
so
and
i
know
as
ever
be
broke
of
it
again
at
his
i
felt
more
disposed
to
be
angry
than
disturbed
by
this
must
be
making
some
ridiculous
mistake
i
said
if
you
were
not
so
old
a
friend
as
you
are
morphew
i
should
not
have
allowed
my
father
to
be
so
spoken
of
to
the
old
man
gave
me
a
look
been
my
master
a
deal
longer
than
been
your
father
he
said
turning
on
his
heel
the
assumption
was
so
comical
that
my
anger
could
not
stand
in
face
of
it
i
went
out
having
been
on
my
way
to
the
door
when
this
conversation
occurred
and
took
my
usual
lounge
about
which
was
not
a
satisfactory
sort
of
amusement
its
vanity
and
emptiness
appeared
to
be
more
evident
than
usual
i
met
people
i
knew
and
had
as
many
pieces
of
news
confided
to
me
i
went
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
high
street
i
made
a
small
purchase
or
two
and
then
i
turned
homeward
despising
myself
yet
finding
no
alternative
within
my
reach
would
a
long
country
walk
have
been
more
virtuous
it
would
at
least
have
been
more
wholesome
but
that
was
all
that
could
be
said
my
mind
did
not
dwell
on
communication
it
seemed
without
sense
or
meaning
to
me
and
after
the
excellent
joke
about
his
superior
interest
in
his
master
to
mine
in
my
father
was
dismissed
lightly
enough
from
my
mind
i
tried
to
invent
some
way
of
telling
this
to
my
father
without
letting
him
perceive
that
morphew
had
been
finding
faults
in
him
or
i
listening
for
it
seemed
a
pity
to
lose
so
good
a
joke
however
as
i
returned
home
something
happened
which
put
the
joke
entirely
out
of
my
head
it
is
curious
when
a
new
subject
of
trouble
or
anxiety
has
been
suggested
to
the
mind
in
an
unexpected
way
how
often
a
second
advertisement
follows
immediately
after
the
first
and
gives
to
that
a
potency
which
in
itself
it
had
not
possessed
i
was
approaching
our
own
door
wondering
whether
my
father
had
gone
and
whether
on
my
return
i
should
find
him
at
leisure
for
i
had
several
little
things
to
say
to
him
when
i
noticed
a
poor
woman
lingering
about
the
closed
gates
she
had
a
baby
sleeping
in
her
arms
it
was
a
spring
night
the
stars
shining
in
the
twilight
and
everything
soft
and
dim
and
the
figure
was
like
a
shadow
flitting
about
now
here
now
there
on
one
side
or
another
of
the
gate
she
stopped
when
she
saw
me
approaching
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
seemed
to
take
a
sudden
resolution
i
watched
her
without
knowing
with
a
prevision
that
she
was
going
to
address
me
though
with
no
sort
of
idea
as
to
the
subject
of
her
address
she
came
up
to
me
doubtfully
it
seemed
yet
certainly
as
i
felt
and
when
she
was
close
to
me
dropped
a
sort
of
hesitating
curtsey
and
said
philip
in
a
low
voice
do
you
want
with
me
i
said
then
she
poured
forth
suddenly
without
warning
or
preparation
her
long
speech
a
flood
of
words
which
must
have
been
all
ready
and
waiting
at
the
doors
of
her
lips
for
utterance
sir
i
want
to
speak
to
you
i
believe
be
so
hard
for
young
and
i
believe
be
so
hard
if
so
be
as
his
own
son
as
always
heard
he
had
but
one
speak
up
for
us
oh
gentleman
it
is
easy
for
the
likes
of
you
that
if
you
comfortable
in
one
room
can
just
walk
into
another
but
if
one
room
is
all
you
have
and
every
bit
of
furniture
you
have
taken
out
of
it
and
nothing
but
the
four
walls
left
not
so
much
as
the
cradle
for
the
child
or
a
chair
for
your
man
to
sit
down
upon
when
he
comes
from
his
work
or
a
saucepan
to
cook
him
his
supper
good
woman
i
said
can
have
taken
all
that
from
you
surely
nobody
can
be
so
cruel
say
cruel
she
cried
with
a
sort
of
triumph
i
knowed
you
would
or
any
true
gentleman
that
hold
with
screwing
poor
folks
just
go
and
say
that
to
him
inside
there
for
the
love
of
god
tell
him
to
think
what
doing
driving
poor
creatures
to
despair
coming
the
lord
be
praised
but
yet
bitter
cold
at
night
with
your
counterpane
gone
and
when
been
working
hard
all
day
and
nothing
but
four
bare
walls
to
come
home
to
and
all
your
poor
little
sticks
of
furniture
that
saved
up
for
and
got
together
one
by
one
all
gone
and
you
no
better
than
when
you
started
or
rather
worse
for
then
you
was
young
oh
sir
the
voice
rose
into
a
sort
of
passionate
wail
and
then
she
added
beseechingly
recovering
herself
speak
for
us
not
refuse
his
own
son
whom
am
i
to
speak
who
is
it
that
has
done
this
to
you
i
said
the
woman
hesitated
again
looking
keenly
in
my
face
then
repeated
with
a
slight
faltering
philip
as
if
that
made
everything
right
i
am
philip
canning
i
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
this
and
to
whom
am
i
to
speak
she
began
to
whimper
crying
and
stopping
herself
please
sir
canning
as
owns
all
the
house
property
about
him
that
our
court
and
the
lane
and
everything
belongs
to
and
taken
the
bed
from
under
us
and
the
cradle
although
said
in
the
bible
as
not
to
take
poor
father
i
cried
in
spite
of
myself
it
must
be
some
agent
some
one
else
in
his
name
you
may
be
sure
he
knows
nothing
of
it
of
course
i
shall
speak
to
him
at
god
bless
you
sir
said
the
woman
but
then
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
no
agent
one
as
never
knows
trouble
him
that
lives
in
that
grand
but
this
was
said
under
her
breath
evidently
not
for
me
to
hear
words
flashed
through
my
mind
as
she
spoke
what
was
this
did
it
afford
an
explanation
of
the
hours
the
big
books
the
strange
visitors
i
took
the
poor
name
and
gave
her
something
to
procure
a
few
comforts
for
the
night
and
went
indoors
disturbed
and
troubled
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
my
father
himself
would
have
acted
thus
but
he
was
not
a
man
to
brook
interference
and
i
did
not
see
how
to
introduce
the
subject
what
to
say
i
could
but
hope
that
at
the
moment
of
broaching
it
words
would
be
put
into
my
mouth
which
often
happens
in
moments
of
necessity
one
knows
not
how
even
when
theme
is
not
so
as
that
for
which
such
help
has
been
promised
as
usual
i
did
not
see
my
father
till
dinner
i
have
said
that
our
dinners
were
very
good
luxurious
in
a
simple
way
everything
excellent
in
its
kind
well
cooked
well
served
the
perfection
of
comfort
without
show
which
is
a
combination
very
dear
to
the
english
heart
i
said
nothing
till
morphew
with
his
solemn
attention
to
everything
that
was
going
had
retired
and
then
it
was
with
some
strain
of
courage
that
i
began
was
stopped
outside
the
gate
by
a
curious
sort
of
petitioner
a
poor
woman
who
seems
to
be
one
of
your
tenants
sir
but
whom
your
agent
must
have
been
rather
too
hard
agent
who
is
that
said
my
father
quietly
know
his
name
and
i
doubt
his
competence
the
poor
creature
seems
to
have
had
everything
taken
from
her
her
bed
her
doubt
she
was
behind
with
her
likely
sir
she
seemed
very
poor
said
i
take
it
coolly
said
my
father
with
an
upward
glance
not
in
the
least
shocked
by
my
statement
when
a
man
or
a
woman
either
takes
a
house
i
suppose
you
will
allow
that
they
ought
to
pay
rent
for
sir
i
replied
they
have
got
anything
to
allow
the
reservation
he
said
but
he
was
not
angry
which
i
had
feared
he
would
be
think
i
continued
your
agent
must
be
too
severe
and
this
emboldens
me
to
say
something
which
has
been
in
my
mind
for
some
these
were
the
words
no
doubt
which
i
had
hoped
would
be
put
into
my
month
they
were
the
suggestion
of
the
moment
and
yet
as
i
said
them
it
was
with
the
most
complete
conviction
of
their
truth
that
is
this
i
am
doing
nothing
my
time
hangs
heavy
on
my
hands
make
me
your
agent
i
will
see
for
myself
and
save
you
from
such
mistakes
and
it
will
be
an
occupation
what
warrant
have
you
for
saying
these
are
mistakes
he
said
testily
then
after
a
moment
is
a
strange
proposal
from
you
phil
do
you
know
what
it
is
you
are
offering
to
be
a
collector
of
rents
going
about
from
door
to
door
from
week
to
week
to
look
after
wretched
little
bits
of
repairs
drains
etc
to
get
paid
which
after
all
is
the
chief
thing
and
not
to
be
taken
in
by
tales
of
to
let
you
be
taken
in
by
men
without
pity
i
said
he
gave
me
a
strange
glance
which
i
did
not
very
well
understand
and
said
abruptly
a
thing
which
so
far
as
i
remember
he
had
never
in
my
life
said
before
become
a
little
like
your
mother
phil
mother
the
reference
was
so
unusual
nay
so
unprecedented
that
i
was
greatly
startled
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
sudden
introduction
of
a
quite
new
element
in
the
stagnant
atmosphere
as
well
as
a
new
party
to
our
conversation
my
father
looked
across
the
table
as
if
with
some
astonishment
at
my
tone
of
surprise
that
so
very
extraordinary
he
said
of
course
it
is
not
extraordinary
that
i
should
resemble
my
mother
only
i
have
heard
very
little
of
her
almost
is
he
got
up
and
placed
himself
before
the
fire
which
was
very
low
as
the
night
was
not
cold
had
not
been
cold
heretofore
at
least
but
it
seemed
to
me
now
that
a
little
chill
came
into
the
dim
and
faded
room
perhaps
it
looked
more
dull
from
the
suggestion
of
a
something
brighter
warmer
that
might
have
been
of
mistakes
he
said
that
was
one
to
sever
you
entirely
from
her
side
of
the
house
but
i
did
not
care
for
the
connection
you
will
understand
how
it
is
that
i
speak
of
it
now
when
i
tell
you
he
stopped
here
however
said
nothing
more
for
a
minute
or
so
and
then
rang
the
bell
morphew
came
as
he
always
did
very
deliberately
so
that
some
time
elapsed
in
silence
during
which
my
surprise
grew
when
the
old
man
appeared
at
the
door
you
put
the
lights
in
the
as
i
told
you
my
father
said
sir
and
opened
the
box
sir
and
a
a
speaking
likeness
this
the
old
man
got
out
in
a
great
hurry
as
if
afraid
that
his
master
would
stop
him
my
father
did
so
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
enough
i
asked
no
information
you
can
go
the
door
closed
upon
us
and
there
was
again
a
pause
my
subject
had
floated
away
altogether
like
a
mist
though
i
had
been
so
concerned
about
it
i
tried
to
resume
but
could
not
something
seemed
to
arrest
my
very
breathing
and
yet
in
this
dull
respectable
house
of
ours
where
everything
breathed
good
character
and
integrity
it
was
certain
that
there
could
be
no
shameful
mystery
to
reveal
it
was
some
time
before
my
father
spoke
not
from
any
purpose
that
i
could
see
but
apparently
because
his
mind
was
busy
with
probably
unaccustomed
thoughts
scarcely
know
the
phil
he
said
at
last
little
i
have
never
seen
it
used
i
have
a
little
awe
of
it
to
tell
the
should
not
be
there
is
no
reason
for
that
but
a
man
by
himself
as
i
have
been
for
the
greater
part
of
my
life
has
no
occasion
for
a
i
always
as
a
matter
of
preference
sat
among
my
books
however
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
the
impression
on
it
is
not
important
i
said
awe
was
childish
i
have
not
thought
of
it
since
i
came
never
was
anything
very
splendid
at
the
best
said
he
he
lifted
the
lamp
from
the
table
with
a
sort
of
abstraction
not
remarking
even
my
offer
to
take
it
from
him
and
led
the
way
he
was
on
the
verge
of
seventy
and
looked
his
age
but
it
was
a
vigorous
age
with
no
symptom
of
giving
way
the
circle
of
light
from
the
lamp
lit
up
his
white
hair
and
keen
blue
eyes
and
clear
complexion
his
forehead
was
like
old
ivory
his
cheek
warmly
colored
an
old
man
yet
a
man
in
full
strength
he
was
taller
than
i
was
and
still
almost
as
strong
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
he
looked
like
a
tower
in
his
great
height
and
bulk
i
reflected
as
i
looked
at
him
that
i
knew
him
intimately
more
intimately
than
any
other
creature
in
the
world
i
was
familiar
with
every
detail
of
his
outward
life
could
it
be
that
in
reality
i
did
not
know
him
at
all
the
was
already
lighted
with
a
flickering
array
of
candles
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
along
the
walls
producing
the
pretty
starry
effect
which
candles
give
without
very
much
light
as
i
had
not
the
smallest
idea
what
i
was
about
to
see
for
was
very
hurriedly
said
and
only
half
comprehensible
in
the
bewilderment
of
my
faculties
my
first
glance
was
at
this
very
unusual
illumination
for
which
i
could
assign
no
reason
the
next
showed
me
a
large
portrait
still
in
the
box
in
which
apparently
it
had
travelled
placed
upright
supported
against
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
my
father
walked
straight
up
to
it
motioned
to
me
to
place
a
smaller
table
close
to
the
picture
on
the
left
side
and
put
his
lamp
upon
that
then
he
waved
his
hand
towards
it
and
stood
aside
that
i
might
see
it
was
a
portrait
of
a
very
young
woman
i
might
say
a
girl
scarcely
twenty
in
a
white
dress
made
in
a
very
simple
old
fashion
though
i
was
too
little
accustomed
to
female
costume
to
be
able
to
fix
the
date
it
might
have
been
a
hundred
years
old
or
twenty
for
aught
i
knew
the
face
had
an
expression
of
youth
candor
and
simplicity
more
than
any
face
i
had
ever
seen
or
so
at
least
in
my
surprise
i
thought
the
eyes
were
a
little
wistful
with
something
which
was
almost
anxiety
which
at
least
was
not
content
in
them
a
faint
almost
imperceptible
curve
in
the
lids
the
complexion
was
of
a
dazzling
fairness
the
hair
light
but
the
eyes
dark
which
gave
individuality
to
the
face
it
would
have
been
as
lovely
had
the
eyes
been
blue
probably
more
so
but
their
darkness
gave
a
touch
of
character
a
slight
discord
which
made
the
harmony
finer
it
was
not
perhaps
beautiful
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
the
girl
must
have
been
too
young
too
slight
too
little
developed
for
actual
beauty
but
a
face
which
so
invited
love
and
confidence
i
never
saw
one
smiled
at
it
with
instinctive
affection
a
sweet
face
i
said
a
lovely
girl
who
is
she
is
this
one
of
the
relations
you
were
speaking
of
on
the
other
side
my
father
made
me
no
reply
he
stood
aside
looking
at
it
as
if
he
knew
it
too
well
to
require
to
look
as
if
the
picture
was
already
in
his
eyes
he
said
after
an
interval
with
a
breath
was
a
lovely
girl
as
you
then
she
is
dead
what
a
pity
i
said
a
pity
so
young
and
so
sweet
we
stood
gazing
at
her
thus
in
her
beautiful
stillness
and
calm
two
men
the
younger
of
us
and
conscious
of
many
experiences
the
other
an
old
man
before
this
impersonation
of
tender
youth
at
length
he
said
with
a
slight
tremulousness
in
his
voice
nothing
suggest
to
you
who
she
is
phil
i
turned
round
to
look
at
him
with
profound
astonishment
but
he
turned
away
from
my
look
a
sort
of
quiver
passed
over
his
face
is
your
mother
he
said
and
walked
suddenly
away
leaving
me
there
my
mother
i
stood
for
a
moment
in
a
kind
of
consternation
before
the
innocent
creature
to
me
no
more
than
a
child
then
a
sudden
laugh
broke
from
me
without
any
will
of
mine
something
ludicrous
as
well
as
something
awful
was
in
it
when
the
laugh
was
over
i
found
myself
with
tears
in
my
eyes
gazing
holding
my
breath
the
soft
features
seemed
to
melt
the
lips
to
move
the
anxiety
in
the
eyes
to
become
a
personal
inquiry
ah
no
nothing
of
the
kind
only
because
of
the
water
in
mine
my
mother
oh
fair
and
gentle
creature
scarcely
woman
how
could
any
voice
call
her
by
that
name
i
had
little
idea
enough
of
what
it
meant
had
heard
it
laughed
at
scoffed
at
reverenced
but
never
had
learned
to
place
it
even
among
the
ideal
powers
of
life
yet
if
it
meant
anything
at
all
what
it
meant
was
worth
thinking
of
what
did
she
ask
looking
at
me
with
those
eyes
what
would
she
have
said
if
lips
had
if
i
had
known
her
only
as
cowper
did
with
a
recollection
there
might
have
been
some
thread
some
faint
but
comprehensible
link
between
us
but
now
all
that
i
felt
was
the
curious
incongruity
poor
child
i
said
to
myself
so
sweet
a
creature
poor
little
tender
soul
as
if
she
had
been
a
little
sister
a
child
of
mine
but
my
mother
i
can
not
tell
how
long
i
stood
looking
at
her
studying
the
candid
sweet
face
which
surely
had
germs
in
it
of
everything
that
was
good
and
beautiful
and
sorry
with
a
profound
regret
that
she
had
died
and
never
carried
these
promises
to
fulfillment
poor
girl
poor
people
who
had
loved
her
these
were
my
thoughts
with
a
curious
vertigo
and
giddiness
of
my
whole
being
in
the
sense
of
a
mysterious
relationship
which
it
was
beyond
my
power
to
understand
presently
my
father
came
back
possibly
because
i
had
been
a
long
time
unconscious
of
the
passage
of
the
minutes
or
perhaps
because
he
was
himself
restless
in
the
strange
disturbance
of
his
habitual
calm
he
came
in
and
put
his
arm
within
mine
leaning
his
weight
partially
upon
me
with
an
affectionate
suggestion
which
went
deeper
than
words
i
pressed
his
arm
to
my
side
it
was
more
between
us
two
grave
englishmen
than
any
embracing
can
not
understand
it
i
said
i
wonder
at
that
but
if
it
is
strange
to
you
phil
think
how
much
more
strange
to
me
that
is
the
partner
of
my
life
i
have
never
had
another
or
thought
of
another
that
girl
if
we
are
to
meet
again
as
i
have
always
hoped
we
should
meet
again
what
am
i
to
say
to
her
i
an
old
man
yes
i
know
what
you
mean
i
am
not
an
old
man
for
my
years
but
my
years
are
threescore
and
ten
and
the
play
is
nearly
played
out
how
am
i
to
meet
that
young
creature
we
used
to
say
to
each
other
that
it
was
forever
that
we
never
could
be
but
one
that
it
was
for
life
and
death
but
what
what
am
i
to
say
to
her
phil
when
i
meet
her
again
that
that
angel
no
it
is
not
her
being
an
angel
that
troubles
me
but
she
is
so
young
she
is
like
my
my
granddaughter
he
cried
with
a
burst
of
what
was
half
sobs
half
laughter
she
is
my
wife
and
i
am
an
old
man
an
old
man
and
so
much
has
happened
that
she
could
not
i
was
too
much
startled
by
this
strange
complaint
to
know
what
to
say
it
was
not
my
own
trouble
and
i
answered
it
in
the
conventional
way
are
not
as
we
are
sir
i
said
look
upon
us
with
larger
other
eyes
than
you
know
what
i
mean
he
said
quickly
and
in
the
interval
he
had
subdued
his
emotion
first
after
she
died
it
was
my
consolation
to
think
that
i
should
meet
her
again
that
we
never
could
be
really
parted
but
my
god
how
i
have
changed
since
then
i
am
another
man
i
am
a
different
being
i
was
not
very
young
even
then
twenty
years
older
than
she
was
but
her
youth
renewed
mine
i
was
not
an
unfit
partner
she
asked
no
better
and
knew
as
much
more
than
i
did
in
some
things
being
so
much
nearer
the
source
as
i
did
in
others
that
were
of
the
world
but
i
have
gone
a
long
way
since
then
phil
a
long
way
and
there
she
stands
just
where
i
left
i
pressed
his
arm
again
i
said
which
was
a
title
i
seldom
used
are
not
to
suppose
that
in
a
higher
life
the
mind
stands
i
did
not
feel
myself
qualified
to
discuss
such
topics
but
something
one
must
say
worse
he
replied
she
too
will
be
like
me
a
different
being
and
we
shall
meet
as
what
as
strangers
as
people
who
have
lost
sight
of
each
other
with
a
long
past
between
us
we
who
parted
my
god
with
with
his
voice
broke
and
ended
for
a
moment
then
while
surprised
and
almost
shocked
by
what
he
said
i
cast
about
in
my
mind
what
to
reply
he
withdrew
his
arm
suddenly
from
mine
and
said
in
his
usual
tone
shall
we
hang
the
picture
phil
it
must
be
here
in
this
room
what
do
you
think
will
be
the
best
light
this
sudden
alteration
took
me
still
more
by
surprise
and
gave
me
almost
an
additional
shock
but
it
was
evident
that
i
must
follow
the
changes
of
his
mood
or
at
least
the
sudden
repression
of
sentiment
which
he
originated
we
went
into
that
simpler
question
with
great
seriousness
consulting
which
would
be
the
best
light
know
i
can
scarcely
advise
i
said
have
never
been
familiar
with
this
room
i
should
like
to
put
off
if
you
mind
till
think
he
said
this
would
be
the
best
it
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
on
the
wall
which
faced
the
windows
not
the
best
light
i
knew
enough
to
be
aware
for
an
when
i
said
so
however
he
answered
me
with
a
little
impatience
does
not
matter
very
much
about
the
best
light
there
will
be
nobody
to
see
it
but
you
and
me
i
have
my
reasons
there
was
a
small
table
standing
against
the
wall
at
this
spot
on
which
he
had
his
hand
as
he
spoke
upon
it
stood
a
little
basket
in
very
fine
his
hand
must
have
trembled
for
the
table
shook
and
the
basket
fell
its
contents
turning
out
upon
the
carpet
little
bits
of
needlework
colored
silks
a
small
piece
of
knitting
half
done
he
laughed
as
they
rolled
out
at
his
feet
and
tried
to
stoop
to
collect
them
then
tottered
to
a
chair
and
covered
for
a
moment
his
face
with
his
hands
no
need
to
ask
what
they
were
no
work
had
been
seen
in
the
house
since
i
could
recollect
it
i
gathered
them
up
reverently
and
put
them
back
i
could
see
ignorant
as
i
was
that
the
bit
of
knitting
was
something
for
an
infant
what
could
i
do
less
than
put
it
to
my
lips
it
had
been
left
in
the
doing
for
me
i
think
this
is
the
best
place
my
father
said
a
minute
after
in
his
usual
tone
we
placed
it
there
that
evening
with
our
own
hands
the
picture
was
large
and
in
a
heavy
frame
but
my
father
would
let
no
one
help
me
but
himself
and
then
with
a
superstition
for
which
i
never
could
give
any
reason
even
to
myself
having
removed
the
packings
we
closed
and
locked
the
door
leaving
the
candles
about
the
room
in
their
soft
strange
illumination
lighting
the
first
night
of
her
return
to
her
old
place
that
night
no
more
was
said
my
father
went
to
his
room
early
which
was
not
his
habit
he
had
never
however
accustomed
me
to
sit
late
with
him
in
the
library
i
had
a
little
study
or
of
my
own
in
which
all
my
special
treasures
were
the
collections
of
my
travels
and
my
favorite
books
and
where
i
always
sat
after
prayers
a
ceremonial
which
was
regularly
kept
up
in
the
house
i
retired
as
usual
this
night
to
my
room
and
as
usual
read
but
somewhat
vaguely
often
pausing
to
think
when
it
was
quite
late
i
went
out
by
the
glass
door
to
the
lawn
and
walked
round
the
house
with
the
intention
of
looking
in
at
the
windows
as
i
had
done
when
a
child
but
i
had
forgotten
that
these
windows
were
all
shuttered
at
night
and
nothing
but
a
faint
penetration
of
the
light
within
through
the
crevices
bore
witness
to
the
installment
of
the
new
dweller
there
in
the
morning
my
father
was
entirely
himself
again
he
told
me
without
emotion
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
obtained
the
picture
it
had
belonged
to
my
family
and
had
fallen
eventually
into
the
hands
of
a
cousin
of
hers
resident
abroad
man
whom
i
did
not
like
and
who
did
not
like
me
my
father
said
was
or
had
been
some
rivalry
he
thought
a
mistake
but
he
was
never
aware
of
that
he
refused
all
my
requests
to
have
a
copy
made
you
may
suppose
phil
that
i
wished
this
very
much
had
i
succeeded
you
would
have
been
acquainted
at
least
with
your
appearance
and
need
not
have
sustained
this
shock
but
he
would
not
consent
it
gave
him
i
think
a
certain
pleasure
to
think
that
he
had
the
only
picture
but
now
he
is
dead
and
out
of
remorse
or
with
some
other
intention
has
left
it
to
looks
like
kindness
said
i
or
something
else
he
might
have
thought
that
by
so
doing
he
was
establishing
a
claim
upon
me
my
father
said
but
he
did
not
seem
disposed
to
add
any
more
on
whose
behalf
he
meant
to
establish
a
claim
i
did
not
know
nor
who
the
man
was
who
had
laid
us
under
so
great
an
obligation
on
his
he
established
a
claim
on
me
at
least
though
as
he
was
dead
i
could
not
see
on
whose
behalf
it
was
and
my
father
said
nothing
more
he
seemed
to
dislike
the
subject
when
i
attempted
to
return
to
it
he
had
recourse
to
his
letters
or
his
newspapers
evidently
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
say
no
more
afterwards
i
went
into
the
to
look
at
the
picture
once
more
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
anxiety
in
her
eyes
was
not
so
evident
as
i
had
thought
it
last
night
the
light
possibly
was
more
favorable
she
stood
just
above
the
place
where
i
make
no
doubt
she
had
sat
in
life
where
her
little
was
not
very
much
above
it
the
picture
was
and
we
had
hung
it
low
so
that
she
might
have
been
stepping
into
the
room
and
was
little
above
my
own
level
as
i
stood
and
looked
at
her
again
once
more
i
smiled
at
the
strange
thought
that
this
young
creature
so
young
almost
childish
could
be
my
mother
and
once
more
my
eyes
grew
wet
looking
at
her
he
was
a
benefactor
indeed
who
had
given
her
back
to
us
i
said
to
myself
that
if
i
could
ever
do
anything
for
him
or
his
i
would
certainly
do
it
for
my
for
this
lovely
young
sake
and
with
this
in
my
mind
and
all
the
thoughts
that
came
with
it
i
am
obliged
to
confess
that
the
other
matter
which
i
had
been
so
full
of
on
the
previous
night
went
entirely
out
of
my
head
it
is
rarely
however
that
such
matters
are
allowed
to
slip
out
of
mind
when
i
went
out
in
the
afternoon
for
my
usual
stroll
or
rather
when
i
returned
from
that
stroll
i
saw
once
more
before
me
the
woman
with
her
baby
whose
story
had
filled
me
with
dismay
on
the
previous
evening
she
was
waiting
at
the
gate
as
before
and
gentleman
but
you
got
some
news
to
give
me
she
said
good
woman
i
have
been
greatly
occupied
i
have
had
no
time
to
do
she
said
with
a
little
cry
of
disappointment
man
said
not
to
make
too
sure
and
that
the
ways
of
the
gentlefolks
is
hard
to
can
not
explain
to
you
i
said
as
gently
as
i
could
it
is
that
has
made
me
forget
you
it
was
an
event
that
can
only
do
you
good
in
the
end
go
home
now
and
see
the
man
that
took
your
things
from
you
and
tell
him
to
come
to
me
i
promise
you
it
shall
all
be
put
the
woman
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
then
burst
forth
as
it
seemed
involuntarily
without
asking
no
questions
after
this
there
came
a
storm
of
tears
and
blessings
from
which
i
made
haste
to
escape
but
not
without
carrying
that
curious
commentary
on
my
rashness
away
with
me
asking
no
questions
it
might
be
foolish
perhaps
but
after
all
how
slight
a
matter
to
make
the
poor
creature
comfortable
at
the
cost
of
what
a
box
or
two
of
cigars
perhaps
or
some
other
trifle
and
if
it
should
be
her
own
fault
or
her
what
then
had
i
been
punished
for
all
my
faults
where
should
i
have
been
now
and
if
the
advantage
should
be
only
temporary
what
then
to
be
relieved
and
comforted
even
for
a
day
or
two
was
not
that
something
to
count
in
life
thus
i
quenched
the
fiery
dart
of
criticism
which
my
herself
had
thrown
into
the
transaction
not
without
a
certain
sense
of
the
humor
of
it
its
effect
however
was
to
make
me
less
anxious
to
see
my
father
to
repeat
my
proposal
to
him
and
to
call
his
attention
to
the
cruelty
performed
in
his
name
this
one
case
i
had
taken
out
of
the
category
of
wrongs
to
be
righted
by
assuming
arbitrarily
the
position
of
providence
in
my
own
person
for
of
course
i
had
bound
myself
to
pay
the
poor
rent
as
well
as
redeem
her
goods
and
whatever
might
happen
to
her
in
the
future
had
taken
the
past
into
my
own
hands
the
man
came
presently
to
see
me
who
it
seems
had
acted
as
my
agent
in
the
matter
know
sir
how
canning
will
take
it
he
said
want
none
of
those
irregular
ones
in
his
property
he
always
says
as
to
look
over
it
and
let
the
rent
run
on
is
making
things
worse
in
the
end
his
rule
is
more
than
a
month
stevens
what
canning
says
to
me
sir
he
says
than
that
they
pay
no
use
and
a
good
rule
a
very
good
rule
he
hear
none
of
their
stories
sir
bless
you
never
get
a
penny
of
rent
from
them
small
houses
if
you
listened
to
their
tales
but
if
so
be
as
pay
rent
none
of
my
business
how
paid
so
long
as
paid
and
send
her
back
her
things
but
just
have
to
be
took
next
time
he
added
composedly
and
over
always
the
same
story
with
them
sort
of
poor
folks
too
poor
for
anything
the
truth
the
man
said
morphew
came
back
to
my
room
after
my
visitor
was
gone
philip
he
said
excuse
me
sir
but
if
going
to
pay
all
the
poor
rent
as
have
distresses
put
in
you
may
just
go
into
the
court
at
once
for
without
end
am
going
to
be
the
agent
myself
morphew
and
manage
for
my
father
and
soon
put
a
stop
to
that
i
said
more
cheerfully
than
i
felt
for
master
he
said
with
a
face
of
consternation
philip
seem
to
have
a
great
contempt
for
me
he
did
not
deny
the
fact
he
said
with
excitement
sir
master
let
himself
be
put
a
stop
to
by
any
man
not
one
to
be
managed
you
quarrel
with
master
philip
for
the
love
of
the
old
man
was
quite
pale
i
said
have
never
quarrelled
with
my
father
and
i
mean
to
begin
morphew
dispelled
his
own
excitement
by
making
up
the
fire
which
was
dying
in
the
grate
it
was
a
very
mild
spring
evening
and
he
made
up
a
great
blaze
which
would
have
suited
december
this
is
one
of
many
ways
in
which
an
old
servant
will
relieve
his
mind
he
muttered
all
the
time
as
he
threw
on
the
coals
and
wood
not
like
it
we
all
know
as
not
like
it
master
stand
no
meddling
philip
this
last
he
discharged
at
me
like
a
flying
arrow
as
he
closed
the
door
i
soon
found
there
was
truth
in
what
he
said
my
father
was
not
angry
he
was
even
half
amused
think
that
plan
of
yours
will
hold
water
phil
i
hear
you
have
been
paying
rents
and
redeeming
furniture
an
expensive
game
and
a
very
profitless
one
of
course
so
long
as
you
are
a
benevolent
gentleman
acting
for
your
own
pleasure
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
i
am
quite
content
if
i
get
my
money
even
out
of
your
pockets
so
long
as
it
amuses
you
but
as
my
collector
you
know
which
you
are
good
enough
to
propose
to
be
course
i
should
act
under
your
orders
i
said
at
least
you
might
be
sure
that
i
would
not
commit
you
to
any
to
any
i
paused
for
a
word
of
oppression
he
said
with
a
smile
of
cruelty
exaction
there
are
words
i
cried
phil
and
let
us
understand
each
other
i
hope
i
have
always
been
a
just
man
i
do
my
duty
on
my
side
and
i
expect
it
from
others
it
is
your
benevolence
that
is
cruel
i
have
calculated
anxiously
how
much
credit
it
is
safe
to
allow
but
i
will
allow
no
man
or
woman
either
to
go
beyond
what
he
or
she
can
make
up
my
law
is
fixed
now
you
understand
my
agents
as
you
call
them
originate
nothing
they
execute
only
what
i
decide
then
no
circumstances
are
taken
into
account
no
bad
luck
no
evil
chances
no
loss
are
no
evil
chances
he
said
is
no
bad
luck
they
reap
as
they
sow
no
i
go
among
them
to
be
cheated
by
their
stories
and
spend
quite
unnecessary
emotion
in
sympathizing
with
them
you
will
find
it
much
better
for
you
that
i
i
deal
with
them
on
a
general
rule
made
i
assure
you
not
without
a
great
deal
of
must
it
always
be
so
i
said
there
no
way
of
ameliorating
or
bringing
in
a
better
state
of
things
seems
not
he
said
get
in
that
direction
so
far
as
i
can
and
then
he
turned
the
conversation
to
general
matters
i
retired
to
my
room
greatly
discouraged
that
night
in
former
ages
or
so
one
is
led
to
suppose
and
in
the
lower
primitive
classes
who
still
linger
near
the
primeval
type
action
of
any
kind
was
and
is
easier
than
amid
the
complication
of
our
higher
civilization
a
bad
man
is
a
distinct
entity
against
whom
you
know
more
or
less
what
steps
to
take
a
tyrant
an
oppressor
a
bad
landlord
a
man
who
lets
miserable
tenements
at
a
to
come
down
to
particulars
and
exposes
his
wretched
tenants
to
all
those
abominations
of
which
we
have
heard
so
much
well
he
is
more
or
less
a
satisfactory
opponent
there
he
is
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
for
him
down
with
him
and
let
there
be
an
end
of
his
wickedness
but
when
on
the
contrary
you
have
before
you
a
good
man
a
just
man
who
has
considered
deeply
a
question
which
you
allow
to
be
full
of
difficulty
who
regrets
but
can
not
being
human
avert
the
miseries
which
to
some
unhappy
individuals
follow
from
the
very
wisdom
of
his
rule
what
can
you
do
what
is
to
be
done
individual
benevolence
at
haphazard
may
balk
him
here
and
there
but
what
have
you
to
put
in
the
place
of
his
scheme
charity
which
makes
paupers
or
what
else
i
had
not
considered
the
question
deeply
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
now
came
to
a
blank
wall
which
my
vague
human
sentiment
of
pity
and
scorn
could
find
no
way
to
breach
there
must
be
wrong
somewhere
but
where
there
must
be
some
change
for
the
better
to
be
made
but
how
i
was
seated
with
a
book
before
me
on
the
table
with
my
head
supported
on
my
hands
my
eyes
were
on
the
printed
page
but
i
was
not
reading
my
mind
was
full
of
these
thoughts
my
heart
of
great
discouragement
and
despondency
a
sense
that
i
could
do
nothing
yet
that
there
surely
must
and
ought
if
i
but
knew
it
be
something
to
do
the
fire
which
morphew
had
built
up
before
dinner
was
dying
out
the
shaded
lamp
on
my
table
left
all
the
corners
in
a
mysterious
twilight
the
house
was
perfectly
still
no
one
moving
my
father
in
the
library
where
after
the
habit
of
many
solitary
years
he
liked
to
be
left
alone
and
i
here
in
my
retreat
preparing
for
the
formation
of
similar
habits
i
thought
all
at
once
of
the
third
member
of
the
party
the
alone
too
in
the
room
that
had
been
hers
and
there
suddenly
occurred
to
me
a
strong
desire
to
take
up
my
lamp
and
go
to
the
and
visit
her
to
see
whether
her
soft
angelic
face
would
give
any
inspiration
i
restrained
however
this
futile
impulse
for
what
could
the
picture
say
and
instead
wondered
what
might
have
been
had
she
lived
had
she
been
there
warmly
enthroned
beside
the
warm
domestic
centre
the
hearth
which
would
have
been
a
common
sanctuary
the
true
home
in
that
case
what
might
have
been
alas
the
question
was
no
more
simple
to
answer
than
the
other
she
might
have
been
there
alone
too
her
business
her
thoughts
as
far
from
her
as
now
when
her
silent
representative
held
her
old
place
in
the
silence
and
darkness
i
had
known
it
so
often
enough
love
itself
does
not
always
give
comprehension
and
sympathy
it
might
be
that
she
was
more
to
us
there
in
the
sweet
image
of
her
undeveloped
beauty
than
she
might
have
been
had
she
lived
and
grown
to
maturity
and
fading
like
the
rest
i
can
not
be
certain
whether
my
mind
was
still
lingering
on
this
not
very
cheerful
reflection
or
if
it
had
been
left
behind
when
the
strange
occurrence
came
of
which
i
have
now
to
tell
can
i
call
it
an
occurrence
my
eyes
were
on
my
book
when
i
thought
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
door
opening
and
shutting
but
so
far
away
and
faint
that
if
real
at
all
it
must
have
been
in
a
far
corner
of
the
house
i
did
not
move
except
to
lift
my
eyes
from
the
book
as
one
does
instinctively
the
better
to
listen
when
but
i
can
not
tell
nor
have
i
ever
been
able
to
describe
exactly
what
it
was
my
heart
made
all
at
once
a
sudden
leap
in
my
breast
i
am
aware
that
this
language
is
figurative
and
that
the
heart
can
not
leap
but
it
is
a
figure
so
entirely
justified
by
sensation
that
no
one
will
have
any
difficulty
in
understanding
what
i
mean
my
heart
leaped
up
and
began
beating
wildly
in
my
throat
in
my
ears
as
if
my
whole
being
had
received
a
sudden
and
intolerable
shock
the
sound
went
through
my
head
like
the
dizzy
sound
of
some
strange
mechanism
a
thousand
wheels
and
springs
circling
echoing
working
in
my
brain
i
felt
the
blood
bound
in
my
veins
my
mouth
became
dry
my
eyes
hot
a
sense
of
something
insupportable
took
possession
of
me
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
then
i
sat
down
again
i
cast
a
quick
glance
round
me
beyond
the
brief
circle
of
the
lamplight
but
there
was
nothing
there
to
account
in
any
way
for
this
sudden
extraordinary
rush
of
sensation
nor
could
i
feel
any
meaning
in
it
any
suggestion
any
moral
impression
i
thought
i
must
be
going
to
be
ill
and
got
out
my
watch
and
felt
my
pulse
it
was
beating
furiously
about
one
hundred
and
throbs
in
a
minute
i
knew
of
no
illness
that
could
come
on
like
this
without
warning
in
a
moment
and
i
tried
to
subdue
myself
to
say
to
myself
that
it
was
nothing
some
flutter
of
the
nerves
some
physical
disturbance
i
laid
myself
down
upon
my
sofa
to
try
if
rest
would
help
me
and
kept
still
as
long
as
the
thumping
and
throbbing
of
this
wild
excited
mechanism
within
like
a
wild
beast
plunging
and
struggling
would
let
me
i
am
quite
aware
of
the
confusion
of
the
metaphor
the
reality
was
just
so
it
was
like
a
mechanism
deranged
going
wildly
with
precipitation
like
those
horrible
wheels
that
from
time
to
time
catch
a
helpless
human
being
in
them
and
tear
him
to
pieces
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
like
a
maddened
living
creature
making
the
wildest
efforts
to
get
free
when
i
could
bear
this
no
longer
i
got
up
and
walked
about
my
room
then
having
still
a
certain
command
of
myself
though
i
could
not
master
the
commotion
within
me
i
deliberately
took
down
an
exciting
book
from
the
shelf
a
book
of
breathless
adventure
which
had
always
interested
me
and
tried
with
that
to
break
the
spell
after
a
few
minutes
however
i
flung
the
book
aside
i
was
gradually
losing
all
power
over
myself
what
i
should
be
moved
to
do
to
shout
aloud
to
struggle
with
i
know
not
what
or
if
i
was
going
mad
altogether
and
next
moment
must
be
a
raving
lunatic
i
could
not
tell
i
kept
looking
round
expecting
i
know
what
several
times
with
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
seemed
to
see
a
movement
as
if
some
one
was
stealing
out
of
sight
but
when
i
looked
straight
there
was
never
anything
but
the
plain
outlines
of
the
wall
and
carpet
the
chairs
standing
in
good
order
at
last
i
snatched
up
the
lamp
in
my
hand
and
went
out
of
the
room
to
look
at
the
picture
which
had
been
faintly
showing
in
my
imagination
from
time
to
time
the
eyes
more
anxious
than
ever
looking
at
me
from
out
the
silent
air
but
no
i
passed
the
door
of
that
room
swiftly
moving
it
seemed
without
any
volition
of
my
own
and
before
i
knew
where
i
was
going
went
into
my
library
with
my
lamp
in
my
hand
he
was
still
sitting
there
at
his
he
looked
up
astonished
to
see
me
hurrying
in
with
my
light
he
said
surprised
i
remember
that
i
shut
the
door
behind
me
and
came
up
to
him
and
set
down
the
lamp
on
his
table
my
sudden
appearance
alarmed
him
is
the
matter
he
cried
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
i
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
gasped
gazing
at
him
the
wild
commotion
ceased
the
blood
subsided
into
its
natural
channels
my
heart
resumed
its
place
i
use
such
words
as
mortal
weakness
can
to
express
the
sensations
i
felt
i
came
to
myself
thus
gazing
at
him
confounded
at
once
by
the
extraordinary
passion
which
i
had
gone
through
and
its
sudden
cessation
matter
i
cried
know
what
is
the
my
father
had
pushed
his
spectacles
up
from
his
eyes
he
appeared
to
me
as
faces
appear
in
a
fever
all
glorified
with
light
which
is
not
in
them
his
eyes
glowing
his
white
hair
shining
like
silver
but
his
looks
were
severe
are
not
a
boy
that
i
should
reprove
you
but
you
ought
to
know
better
he
said
then
i
explained
to
him
so
far
as
i
was
able
what
had
happened
had
happened
nothing
had
happened
he
did
not
understand
me
nor
did
i
now
that
it
was
over
understand
myself
but
he
saw
enough
to
make
him
aware
that
the
disturbance
in
me
was
serious
and
not
caused
by
any
folly
of
my
own
he
was
very
kind
as
soon
as
he
had
assured
himself
of
this
and
talked
taking
pains
to
bring
me
back
to
unexciting
subjects
he
had
a
letter
in
his
hand
with
a
very
deep
border
of
black
when
i
came
in
i
observed
it
without
taking
any
notice
or
associating
it
with
anything
i
knew
he
had
many
correspondents
and
although
we
were
excellent
friends
we
had
never
been
on
those
confidential
terms
which
warrant
one
man
in
asking
another
from
whom
a
special
letter
has
come
we
were
not
so
near
to
each
other
as
this
though
we
were
father
and
son
after
a
while
i
went
back
to
my
own
room
and
finished
the
evening
in
my
usual
way
without
any
return
of
the
excitement
which
now
that
it
was
over
looked
to
me
like
some
extraordinary
dream
what
had
it
meant
had
it
meant
anything
i
said
to
myself
that
it
must
be
purely
physical
something
gone
temporarily
amiss
which
had
righted
itself
it
was
physical
the
excitement
did
not
affect
my
mind
i
was
independent
of
it
all
the
time
a
spectator
of
my
own
agitation
a
clear
proof
that
whatever
it
was
it
had
affected
my
bodily
organization
alone
next
day
i
returned
to
the
problem
which
i
had
not
been
able
to
solve
i
found
out
my
petitioner
in
the
back
street
and
that
she
was
happy
in
the
recovery
of
her
possessions
which
to
my
eyes
indeed
did
not
seem
very
worthy
either
of
lamentation
or
delight
nor
was
her
house
the
tidy
house
which
injured
virtue
should
have
when
restored
to
its
humble
rights
she
was
not
injured
virtue
it
was
clear
she
made
me
a
great
many
curtseys
and
poured
forth
a
number
of
blessings
her
came
in
while
i
was
there
and
hoped
in
a
gruff
voice
that
god
would
reward
me
and
that
the
old
let
alone
i
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
man
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
the
dark
lane
behind
the
house
of
a
night
he
would
not
be
a
pleasant
person
to
find
in
way
nor
was
this
all
when
i
went
out
into
the
little
street
which
it
appeared
was
all
or
almost
all
my
property
a
number
of
groups
formed
in
my
way
and
at
least
applicants
sidled
up
more
claims
nor
mary
jordan
any
day
said
one
lived
on
squire
property
one
place
and
another
this
twenty
what
do
you
say
to
me
said
another
six
children
to
her
two
bless
you
sir
and
a
father
to
do
for
i
believed
in
my
rule
before
i
got
out
of
the
street
and
approved
his
wisdom
in
keeping
himself
free
from
personal
contact
with
his
tenants
yet
when
i
looked
back
upon
the
swarming
thoroughfare
the
mean
little
houses
the
women
at
their
doors
all
so
and
eager
to
contend
for
my
favor
my
heart
sank
within
me
at
the
thought
that
out
of
their
misery
some
portion
of
our
wealth
came
i
care
how
small
a
portion
that
i
young
and
strong
should
be
kept
idle
and
in
luxury
in
some
part
through
the
money
screwed
out
of
their
necessities
obtained
sometimes
by
the
sacrifice
of
everything
they
prized
of
course
i
know
all
the
ordinary
commonplaces
of
life
as
well
as
any
one
that
if
you
build
a
house
with
your
hand
or
your
money
and
let
it
the
rent
of
it
is
your
just
due
and
must
be
paid
but
yet
you
think
sir
i
said
that
evening
at
dinner
the
subject
being
reintroduced
by
my
father
himself
we
have
some
duty
towards
them
when
we
draw
so
much
from
them
he
said
take
as
much
trouble
about
their
drains
as
i
do
about
my
is
always
something
i
it
is
a
great
deal
it
is
more
than
they
get
anywhere
else
i
keep
them
clean
as
far
as
possible
i
give
them
at
least
the
means
of
keeping
clean
and
thus
check
disease
and
prolong
life
which
is
more
i
assure
you
than
any
right
to
i
was
not
prepared
with
arguments
as
i
ought
to
have
been
that
is
all
in
the
gospel
according
to
adam
smith
which
my
father
had
been
brought
up
in
but
of
which
the
tenets
had
begun
to
be
less
binding
in
my
day
i
wanted
something
more
or
else
something
less
but
my
views
were
not
so
clear
nor
my
system
so
logical
and
as
that
upon
which
my
father
rested
his
conscience
and
drew
his
percentage
with
a
light
heart
yet
i
thought
there
were
signs
in
him
of
some
perturbation
i
met
him
one
morning
coming
out
of
the
room
in
which
the
portrait
hung
as
if
he
had
gone
to
look
at
it
stealthily
he
was
shaking
his
head
and
saying
no
to
himself
not
perceiving
me
and
i
stepped
aside
when
i
saw
him
so
absorbed
for
myself
i
entered
that
room
but
little
i
went
outside
as
i
had
so
often
done
when
i
was
a
child
and
looked
through
the
windows
into
the
still
and
now
sacred
place
which
had
always
impressed
me
with
a
certain
awe
looked
at
so
the
slight
figure
in
its
white
dress
seemed
to
be
stepping
down
into
the
room
from
some
slight
visionary
altitude
looking
with
that
which
had
seemed
to
me
at
first
anxiety
which
i
sometimes
represented
to
myself
now
as
a
wistful
curiosity
as
if
she
were
looking
for
the
life
which
might
have
been
hers
where
was
the
existence
that
had
belonged
to
her
the
sweet
household
place
the
infant
she
had
left
she
would
no
more
recognize
the
man
who
thus
came
to
look
at
her
as
through
a
veil
with
a
mystic
reverence
than
i
could
recognize
her
i
could
never
be
her
child
to
her
any
more
than
she
could
be
a
mother
to
me
thus
time
passed
on
for
several
quiet
days
there
was
nothing
to
make
us
give
any
special
heed
to
the
passage
of
time
life
being
very
uneventful
and
its
habits
unvaried
my
mind
was
very
much
preoccupied
by
my
tenants
he
had
a
great
deal
of
property
in
the
town
which
was
so
near
us
streets
of
small
houses
the
property
i
was
assured
of
any
i
was
very
anxious
to
come
to
some
settled
conclusion
on
the
one
hand
not
to
let
myself
be
carried
away
by
sentiment
on
the
other
not
to
allow
my
strongly
roused
feelings
to
fall
into
the
blank
of
routine
as
his
had
done
i
was
seated
one
evening
in
my
own
busy
with
this
matter
busy
with
calculations
as
to
cost
and
profit
with
an
anxious
desire
to
convince
him
either
that
his
profits
were
greater
than
justice
allowed
or
that
they
carried
with
them
a
more
urgent
duty
than
he
had
conceived
it
was
night
but
not
late
not
more
than
ten
the
household
still
astir
everything
was
quiet
not
the
solemnity
of
midnight
silence
in
which
there
is
always
something
of
mystery
but
the
quiet
of
the
evening
full
of
the
faint
habitual
sounds
of
a
human
dwelling
a
consciousness
of
life
about
and
i
was
very
busy
with
my
figures
interested
feeling
no
room
in
my
mind
for
any
other
thought
the
singular
experience
which
had
startled
me
so
much
had
passed
over
very
quickly
and
there
had
been
no
return
i
had
ceased
to
think
of
it
indeed
i
had
never
thought
of
it
save
for
the
moment
setting
it
down
after
it
was
over
to
a
physical
cause
without
much
difficulty
at
this
time
i
was
far
too
busy
to
have
thoughts
to
spare
for
anything
or
room
for
imagination
and
when
suddenly
in
a
moment
without
any
warning
the
first
symptom
returned
i
started
with
it
into
determined
resistance
resolute
not
to
be
fooled
by
any
mock
influence
which
could
resolve
itself
into
the
action
of
nerves
or
ganglions
the
first
symptom
as
before
was
that
my
heart
sprang
up
with
a
bound
as
if
a
cannon
had
been
fired
at
my
ear
my
whole
being
responded
with
a
start
the
pen
fell
out
of
my
fingers
the
figures
went
out
of
my
head
as
if
all
faculty
had
departed
and
yet
i
was
conscious
for
a
time
at
least
of
keeping
my
i
was
like
the
rider
of
a
frightened
horse
rendered
almost
wild
by
something
which
in
the
mystery
of
its
voiceless
being
it
has
seen
something
on
the
road
which
it
will
not
pass
but
wildly
plunging
resisting
every
persuasion
turns
from
with
passion
the
rider
himself
after
a
time
becomes
infected
with
this
inexplainable
desperation
of
terror
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
done
so
but
for
a
time
i
kept
the
upper
hand
i
would
not
allow
myself
to
spring
up
as
i
wished
as
my
impulse
was
but
sat
there
doggedly
clinging
to
my
books
to
my
table
fixing
myself
on
i
did
not
mind
what
to
resist
the
flood
of
sensation
of
emotion
which
was
sweeping
through
me
carrying
me
away
i
tried
to
continue
my
calculations
i
tried
to
stir
myself
up
with
recollections
of
the
miserable
sights
i
had
seen
the
poverty
the
helplessness
i
tried
to
work
myself
into
indignation
but
all
through
these
efforts
i
felt
the
contagion
growing
upon
me
my
mind
falling
into
sympathy
with
all
those
straining
faculties
of
the
body
startled
excited
driven
wild
by
something
i
knew
not
what
it
was
not
fear
i
was
like
a
ship
at
sea
straining
and
plunging
against
wind
and
tide
but
i
was
not
afraid
i
am
obliged
to
use
these
metaphors
otherwise
i
could
give
no
explanation
of
my
condition
seized
upon
against
my
will
and
torn
from
all
those
moorings
of
reason
to
which
i
clung
with
desperation
as
long
as
i
had
the
strength
when
i
got
up
from
my
chair
at
last
the
battle
was
lost
so
far
as
my
powers
of
were
concerned
i
got
up
or
rather
was
dragged
up
from
my
seat
clutching
at
these
material
things
round
me
as
with
a
last
effort
to
hold
my
own
but
that
was
no
longer
possible
i
was
overcome
i
stood
for
a
moment
looking
round
me
feebly
feeling
myself
begin
to
babble
with
stammering
lips
which
was
the
alternative
of
shrieking
and
which
i
seemed
to
choose
as
a
lesser
evil
what
i
said
was
am
i
to
do
and
after
a
while
do
you
want
me
to
do
although
throughout
i
saw
no
one
heard
no
voice
and
had
in
reality
not
power
enough
in
my
dizzy
and
confused
brain
to
know
what
i
myself
meant
i
stood
thus
for
a
moment
looking
blankly
round
me
for
guidance
repeating
the
question
which
seemed
after
a
time
to
become
almost
mechanical
do
you
want
me
to
do
though
i
neither
knew
to
whom
i
addressed
it
nor
why
i
said
it
presently
whether
in
answer
whether
in
mere
yielding
of
nature
i
can
not
tell
i
became
aware
of
a
difference
not
a
lessening
of
the
agitation
but
a
softening
as
if
my
powers
of
resistance
being
exhausted
a
gentler
force
a
more
benignant
influence
had
room
i
felt
myself
consent
to
whatever
it
was
my
heart
melted
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
i
seemed
to
give
myself
up
and
move
as
if
drawn
by
some
one
whose
arm
was
in
mine
as
if
softly
swept
along
not
forcibly
but
with
an
utter
consent
of
all
my
faculties
to
do
i
knew
not
what
for
love
of
i
knew
not
whom
for
love
that
was
how
it
seemed
not
by
force
as
when
i
went
before
but
my
steps
took
the
same
course
i
went
through
the
dim
passages
in
an
exaltation
indescribable
and
opened
the
door
of
my
room
he
was
seated
there
at
his
table
as
usual
the
light
of
the
lamp
falling
on
his
white
hair
he
looked
up
with
some
surprise
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
he
said
and
with
a
look
of
wondering
apprehension
on
his
face
watched
my
approach
i
went
straight
up
to
him
and
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
what
is
the
matter
what
do
you
want
with
me
what
is
it
he
said
i
tell
you
i
come
not
of
myself
there
must
be
something
in
it
though
i
know
what
it
is
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
been
brought
to
you
you
going
he
stopped
himself
the
exclamation
had
been
begun
with
an
angry
intention
he
stopped
looking
at
me
with
a
scared
look
as
if
perhaps
it
might
be
true
you
mean
mad
i
think
so
i
have
no
delusions
that
i
know
of
father
think
do
you
know
any
reason
why
i
am
brought
here
for
some
cause
there
must
i
stood
with
my
hand
upon
the
back
of
his
chair
his
table
was
covered
with
papers
among
which
were
several
letters
with
the
broad
black
border
which
i
had
before
observed
i
noticed
this
now
in
my
excitement
without
any
distinct
association
of
thoughts
for
that
i
was
not
capable
of
but
the
black
border
caught
my
eye
and
i
was
conscious
that
he
too
gave
a
hurried
glance
at
them
and
with
one
hand
swept
them
away
he
said
pushing
back
his
chair
must
be
ill
my
poor
boy
evidently
we
have
not
been
treating
you
rightly
you
have
been
more
ill
all
through
than
i
supposed
let
me
persuade
you
to
go
to
am
perfectly
well
i
said
let
us
deceive
one
another
i
am
neither
a
man
to
go
mad
nor
to
see
ghosts
what
it
is
that
has
got
the
command
over
me
i
tell
but
there
is
some
cause
for
it
you
are
doing
something
or
planning
something
with
which
i
have
a
right
to
he
turned
round
squarely
in
his
chair
with
a
spark
in
his
blue
eyes
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
meddled
with
have
yet
to
learn
what
can
give
my
son
a
right
to
interfere
i
am
in
possession
of
all
my
faculties
i
i
cried
you
listen
to
me
no
one
can
say
i
have
been
undutiful
or
disrespectful
i
am
a
man
with
a
right
to
speak
my
mind
and
i
have
done
so
but
this
is
different
i
am
not
here
by
my
own
will
something
that
is
stronger
than
i
has
brought
me
there
is
something
in
your
mind
which
disturbs
others
i
know
what
i
am
saying
this
is
not
what
i
meant
to
say
but
you
know
the
meaning
better
than
i
some
one
who
can
speak
to
you
only
by
me
speaks
to
you
by
me
and
i
know
that
you
he
gazed
up
at
me
growing
pale
and
his
underlip
fell
i
for
my
part
felt
that
my
message
was
delivered
my
heart
sank
into
a
stillness
so
sudden
that
it
made
me
faint
the
light
swam
in
my
eyes
everything
went
round
with
me
i
kept
upright
only
by
my
hold
upon
the
chair
and
in
the
sense
of
utter
weakness
that
followed
i
dropped
on
my
knees
i
think
first
then
on
the
nearest
seat
that
presented
itself
and
covering
my
face
with
my
hands
had
hard
ado
not
to
sob
in
the
sudden
removal
of
that
strange
influence
the
relaxation
of
the
strain
there
was
silence
between
us
for
some
time
then
he
said
but
with
a
voice
slightly
broken
understand
you
phil
you
must
have
taken
some
fancy
into
your
mind
which
my
slower
intelligence
speak
out
what
you
want
to
say
what
do
you
find
fault
with
is
it
all
all
that
woman
jordan
he
gave
a
short
forced
laugh
as
he
broke
off
and
shook
me
almost
roughly
by
the
shoulder
saying
out
what
what
do
you
want
to
say
seems
sir
that
i
have
said
my
voice
trembled
more
than
his
but
not
in
the
same
way
have
told
you
that
i
did
not
come
by
my
own
will
quite
otherwise
i
resisted
as
long
as
i
could
now
all
is
said
it
is
for
you
to
judge
whether
it
was
worth
the
trouble
or
he
got
up
from
his
seat
in
a
hurried
way
would
have
me
as
mad
as
yourself
he
said
then
sat
down
again
as
quickly
phil
if
it
will
please
you
not
to
make
a
breach
the
first
breach
between
us
you
shall
have
your
way
i
consent
to
your
looking
into
that
matter
about
the
poor
tenants
your
mind
shall
not
be
upset
about
that
even
though
i
enter
into
all
your
you
i
said
father
that
is
not
what
it
it
is
a
piece
of
folly
he
said
angrily
suppose
you
mean
but
this
is
a
matter
in
which
i
choose
to
judge
for
know
what
i
mean
i
said
as
quietly
as
i
could
i
myself
know
that
proves
there
is
good
reason
for
it
will
you
do
one
thing
for
me
before
i
leave
you
come
with
me
into
the
end
he
said
with
again
the
tremble
in
his
voice
to
be
served
by
that
very
well
know
but
to
look
at
her
you
and
i
together
will
always
do
something
for
us
sir
as
for
breach
there
can
be
no
breach
when
we
stand
he
got
up
trembling
like
an
old
man
which
he
was
but
which
he
never
looked
like
save
at
moments
of
emotion
like
this
and
told
me
to
take
the
light
then
stopped
when
he
had
got
across
the
room
is
a
piece
of
theatrical
sentimentality
he
said
phil
i
will
not
go
i
will
not
bring
her
into
any
such
put
down
the
lamp
and
if
you
will
take
my
advice
go
to
least
i
said
will
trouble
you
no
more
father
so
long
as
you
understand
there
need
be
no
more
to
he
gave
me
a
very
curt
and
turned
back
to
his
papers
the
letters
with
the
black
edge
either
by
my
imagination
or
in
reality
always
keeping
uppermost
i
went
to
my
own
room
for
my
lamp
and
then
alone
proceeded
to
the
silent
shrine
in
which
the
portrait
hung
i
at
least
would
look
at
her
i
know
whether
i
asked
myself
in
so
many
words
if
it
were
she
who
or
if
it
was
any
one
i
knew
nothing
but
my
heart
was
drawn
with
a
softness
born
perhaps
of
the
great
weakness
in
which
i
was
left
after
that
visitation
to
her
to
look
at
her
to
see
perhaps
if
there
was
any
sympathy
any
approval
in
her
face
i
set
down
my
lamp
on
the
table
where
her
little
still
was
the
light
threw
a
gleam
upward
upon
her
she
seemed
more
than
ever
to
be
stepping
into
the
room
coming
down
towards
me
coming
back
to
her
life
ah
no
her
life
was
lost
and
vanished
all
mine
stood
between
her
and
the
days
she
knew
she
looked
at
me
with
eyes
that
did
not
change
the
anxiety
i
had
seen
at
first
seemed
now
a
wistful
subdued
question
but
that
difference
was
not
in
her
look
but
in
mine
i
need
not
linger
on
the
intervening
time
the
doctor
who
attended
us
usually
came
in
next
day
accident
and
we
had
a
long
conversation
on
the
following
day
a
very
impressive
yet
genial
gentleman
from
town
lunched
with
us
a
friend
of
my
something
but
the
introduction
was
hurried
and
i
did
not
catch
his
name
he
too
had
a
long
talk
with
me
afterwards
my
father
being
called
away
to
speak
to
some
one
on
business
drew
me
out
on
the
subject
of
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
he
said
he
heard
i
took
great
interest
in
this
question
which
had
come
so
much
to
the
front
at
the
present
moment
he
was
interested
in
it
too
and
wanted
to
know
the
view
i
took
i
explained
at
considerable
length
that
my
view
did
not
concern
the
general
subject
on
which
i
had
scarcely
thought
so
much
as
the
individual
mode
of
management
of
my
estate
he
was
a
most
patient
and
intelligent
listener
agreeing
with
me
on
some
points
differing
in
others
and
his
visit
was
very
pleasant
i
had
no
idea
until
after
of
its
special
object
though
a
certain
puzzled
look
and
slight
shake
of
the
head
when
my
father
returned
might
have
thrown
some
light
upon
it
the
report
of
the
medical
experts
in
my
case
must
however
have
been
quite
satisfactory
for
i
heard
nothing
more
of
them
it
was
i
think
a
fortnight
later
when
the
next
and
last
of
these
strange
experiences
came
this
time
it
was
morning
about
noon
a
wet
and
rather
dismal
spring
day
the
leaves
seemed
to
tap
at
the
window
with
an
appeal
to
be
taken
in
the
primroses
that
showed
golden
upon
the
grass
at
the
roots
of
the
trees
just
beyond
the
grass
of
the
lawn
were
all
drooped
and
sodden
among
their
sheltering
leaves
the
very
growth
seemed
dreary
the
sense
of
spring
in
the
air
making
the
feeling
of
winter
a
grievance
instead
of
the
natural
effect
which
it
had
conveyed
a
few
months
before
i
had
been
writing
letters
and
was
cheerful
enough
going
back
among
the
associates
of
my
old
life
with
perhaps
a
little
longing
for
its
freedom
and
independence
but
at
the
same
time
a
not
ungrateful
consciousness
that
for
the
moment
my
present
tranquillity
might
be
best
this
was
my
condition
a
not
unpleasant
one
when
suddenly
the
now
symptoms
of
the
visitation
to
which
i
had
become
subject
suddenly
seized
upon
me
the
leap
of
the
heart
the
sudden
causeless
overwhelming
physical
excitement
which
i
could
neither
ignore
nor
allay
i
was
terrified
beyond
description
beyond
reason
when
i
became
conscious
that
this
was
about
to
begin
over
again
what
purpose
did
it
answer
what
good
was
in
it
my
father
indeed
understood
the
meaning
of
it
though
i
did
not
understand
but
it
was
little
agreeable
to
be
thus
made
a
helpless
instrument
without
any
will
of
mine
in
an
operation
of
which
i
knew
nothing
and
to
enact
the
part
of
the
oracle
unwillingly
with
suffering
and
such
a
strain
as
it
took
me
days
to
get
over
i
resisted
not
as
before
but
yet
desperately
trying
with
better
knowledge
to
keep
down
the
growing
passion
i
hurried
to
my
room
and
swallowed
a
dose
of
a
sedative
which
had
been
given
me
to
procure
sleep
on
my
first
return
from
india
i
saw
morphew
in
the
hall
and
called
him
to
talk
to
him
and
cheat
myself
if
possible
by
that
means
morphew
lingered
however
and
before
he
came
i
was
beyond
conversation
i
heard
him
speak
his
voice
coming
vaguely
through
the
turmoil
which
was
already
in
my
ears
but
what
he
said
i
have
never
known
i
stood
staring
trying
to
recover
my
power
of
attention
with
an
aspect
which
ended
by
completely
frightening
the
man
he
cried
out
at
last
that
he
was
sure
i
was
ill
that
he
must
bring
me
something
which
words
penetrated
more
or
less
into
my
maddened
brain
it
became
impressed
upon
me
that
he
was
going
to
get
some
one
one
of
my
doctors
perhaps
to
prevent
me
from
acting
to
stop
my
interference
and
that
if
i
waited
a
moment
longer
i
might
be
too
late
a
vague
idea
seized
me
at
the
same
time
of
taking
refuge
with
the
portrait
going
to
its
feet
throwing
myself
there
perhaps
till
the
paroxysm
should
be
over
but
it
was
not
there
that
my
footsteps
were
directed
i
can
remember
making
an
effort
to
open
the
door
of
the
and
feeling
myself
swept
past
it
as
if
by
a
gale
of
wind
it
was
not
there
that
i
had
to
go
i
knew
very
well
where
i
had
to
go
once
more
on
my
confused
and
voiceless
mission
to
my
father
who
understood
although
i
could
not
understand
yet
as
it
was
daylight
and
all
was
clear
i
could
not
help
noting
one
or
two
circumstances
on
my
way
i
saw
some
one
sitting
in
the
hall
as
if
waiting
a
woman
a
girl
a
figure
with
a
thick
veil
over
her
face
and
asked
myself
who
she
was
and
what
she
wanted
there
this
question
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
present
condition
somehow
got
into
my
mind
and
was
tossed
up
and
down
upon
the
tumultuous
tide
like
a
stray
log
on
the
breast
of
a
fiercely
rolling
stream
now
submerged
now
coming
uppermost
at
the
mercy
of
the
waters
it
did
not
stop
me
for
a
moment
as
i
hurried
towards
my
room
but
it
got
upon
the
current
of
my
mind
i
flung
open
my
door
and
closed
it
again
after
me
without
seeing
who
was
there
or
how
he
was
engaged
the
full
clearness
of
the
daylight
did
not
identify
him
as
the
lamp
did
at
night
he
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
the
door
with
a
glance
of
apprehension
and
rising
suddenly
interrupting
some
one
who
was
standing
speaking
to
him
with
much
earnestness
and
even
vehemence
came
forward
to
meet
me
can
not
be
disturbed
at
present
he
said
quickly
am
then
seeing
the
look
in
my
face
which
by
this
time
he
knew
he
too
changed
color
he
said
in
a
low
imperative
voice
boy
go
away
go
away
let
a
stranger
see
you
go
away
i
said
is
impossible
you
know
why
i
have
come
i
can
not
if
i
would
it
is
more
powerful
than
i
sir
he
said
at
once
no
more
of
this
folly
i
will
not
have
you
in
this
room
i
made
no
answer
i
know
that
i
could
have
done
so
there
had
never
been
any
struggle
between
us
before
but
i
had
no
power
to
do
one
thing
or
another
the
tumult
within
me
was
in
full
career
i
heard
indeed
what
he
said
and
was
able
to
reply
but
his
words
too
were
like
straws
tossed
upon
the
tremendous
stream
i
saw
now
with
my
feverish
eyes
who
the
other
person
present
was
it
was
a
woman
dressed
also
in
mourning
similar
to
the
one
in
the
hall
but
this
a
woman
like
a
respectable
servant
she
had
been
crying
and
in
the
pause
caused
by
this
encounter
between
my
father
and
myself
dried
her
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
which
she
rolled
like
a
ball
in
her
hand
evidently
in
strong
emotion
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
as
my
father
spoke
to
me
for
a
moment
with
a
gleam
of
hope
then
falling
back
into
her
former
attitude
my
father
returned
to
his
seat
he
was
much
agitated
too
though
doing
all
that
was
possible
to
conceal
it
my
inopportune
arrival
was
evidently
a
great
and
vexation
to
him
he
gave
me
the
only
look
of
passionate
displeasure
i
have
ever
had
from
him
as
he
sat
down
again
but
he
said
nothing
more
must
understand
he
said
addressing
the
woman
i
have
said
my
last
words
on
this
subject
i
choose
to
enter
into
it
again
in
the
presence
of
my
son
who
is
not
well
enough
to
be
made
a
party
to
any
discussion
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
have
had
so
much
trouble
in
vain
but
you
were
warned
beforehand
and
you
have
only
yourself
to
blame
i
acknowledge
no
claim
and
nothing
you
can
say
will
change
my
resolution
i
must
beg
you
to
go
away
all
this
is
very
painful
and
quite
useless
i
acknowledge
no
sir
she
cried
her
eyes
beginning
once
more
to
flow
her
speech
interrupted
by
little
sobs
i
did
wrong
to
speak
of
a
claim
not
educated
to
argue
with
a
gentleman
maybe
we
have
no
claim
but
if
not
by
right
oh
canning
you
let
your
heart
be
touched
by
pity
she
know
what
saying
poor
dear
not
one
to
beg
and
pray
for
herself
as
doing
for
her
oh
sir
so
young
so
lone
in
this
world
not
a
friend
to
stand
by
her
nor
a
house
to
take
her
in
you
are
the
nearest
to
her
of
any
one
left
in
this
world
she
a
relation
not
one
so
near
as
you
oh
she
cried
with
a
sudden
thought
turning
quickly
round
upon
me
your
son
now
i
think
of
it
not
your
relation
she
is
but
his
through
his
mother
nearer
nearer
oh
sir
young
your
heart
should
be
more
tender
here
is
my
young
lady
that
has
no
one
in
the
world
to
look
to
her
your
own
flesh
and
blood
your
cousin
your
my
father
called
to
her
to
stop
with
a
voice
of
thunder
leave
us
at
once
it
is
not
a
matter
to
be
discussed
with
and
then
in
a
moment
it
became
clear
to
me
what
it
was
it
had
been
with
difficulty
that
i
had
kept
myself
still
my
breast
was
laboring
with
the
fever
of
an
impulse
poured
into
me
more
than
i
could
contain
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
knew
why
i
hurried
towards
him
and
took
his
hand
though
he
resisted
into
mine
mine
were
burning
but
his
like
ice
their
touch
burnt
me
with
its
chill
like
fire
is
what
it
is
i
cried
had
no
knowledge
before
i
know
now
what
is
being
asked
of
you
but
father
understand
you
know
and
i
know
now
that
some
one
sends
me
some
one
who
has
a
right
to
he
pushed
me
away
with
all
his
might
are
mad
he
cried
right
have
you
to
think
oh
you
are
mad
mad
i
have
seen
it
coming
on
the
woman
the
petitioner
had
grown
silent
watching
this
brief
conflict
with
the
terror
and
interest
with
which
women
watch
a
struggle
between
men
she
started
and
fell
back
when
she
heard
what
he
said
but
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
me
following
every
movement
i
made
when
i
turned
to
go
away
a
cry
of
indescribable
disappointment
and
remonstrance
burst
from
her
and
even
my
father
raised
himself
up
and
stared
at
my
withdrawal
astonished
to
find
that
he
had
overcome
me
so
soon
and
easily
i
paused
for
a
moment
and
looked
back
on
them
seeing
them
large
and
vague
through
the
mist
of
fever
am
not
going
away
i
said
am
going
for
another
messenger
one
you
my
father
rose
he
called
out
to
me
threateningly
will
have
nothing
touched
that
is
hers
nothing
that
is
hers
shall
be
profaned
i
waited
to
hear
no
more
i
knew
what
i
had
to
do
by
what
means
it
was
conveyed
to
me
i
can
not
tell
but
the
certainty
of
an
influence
which
no
one
thought
of
calmed
me
in
the
midst
of
my
fever
i
went
out
into
the
hall
where
i
had
seen
the
young
stranger
waiting
i
went
up
to
her
and
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
she
rose
at
once
with
a
little
movement
of
alarm
yet
with
docile
and
instant
obedience
as
if
she
had
expected
the
summons
i
made
her
take
off
her
veil
and
her
bonnet
scarcely
looking
at
her
scarcely
seeing
her
knowing
how
it
was
i
took
her
soft
small
cool
yet
trembling
hand
into
mine
it
was
so
soft
and
cool
not
cold
it
refreshed
me
with
its
tremulous
touch
all
through
i
moved
and
spoke
like
a
man
in
a
dream
swiftly
noiselessly
all
the
complications
of
waking
life
removed
without
embarrassment
without
reflection
without
the
loss
of
a
moment
my
father
was
still
standing
up
leaning
a
little
forward
as
he
had
done
when
i
withdrew
threatening
yet
not
knowing
what
i
might
be
about
to
do
when
i
returned
with
my
companion
that
was
the
one
thing
he
had
not
thought
of
he
was
entirely
undecided
unprepared
he
gave
her
one
look
flung
up
his
arms
above
his
head
and
uttered
a
distracted
cry
so
wild
that
it
seemed
the
last
outcry
of
nature
then
fell
back
like
a
sudden
ruin
upon
himself
into
his
chair
i
had
no
leisure
to
think
how
he
was
or
whether
he
could
hear
what
i
said
i
had
my
message
to
deliver
i
said
laboring
with
my
panting
breath
is
for
this
that
heaven
has
opened
and
one
whom
i
never
saw
one
whom
i
know
not
has
taken
possession
of
me
had
we
been
less
earthly
we
should
have
seen
her
herself
and
not
merely
her
image
i
have
not
even
known
what
she
meant
i
have
been
as
a
fool
without
understanding
this
is
the
third
time
i
have
come
to
you
with
her
message
without
knowing
what
to
say
but
now
i
have
found
it
out
this
is
her
message
i
have
found
it
out
at
there
was
an
awful
pause
a
pause
in
which
no
one
moved
or
breathed
then
there
came
a
broken
voice
out
of
my
chair
he
had
not
understood
though
i
think
he
heard
what
i
said
he
put
out
two
feeble
hands
i
think
i
am
dying
has
she
has
she
come
for
me
he
said
we
had
to
carry
him
to
his
bed
what
struggles
he
had
gone
through
before
i
can
not
tell
he
had
stood
fast
and
had
refused
to
be
moved
and
now
he
fell
like
an
old
tower
like
an
old
tree
the
necessity
there
was
for
thinking
of
him
saved
me
from
the
physical
consequences
which
had
prostrated
me
on
a
former
occasion
i
had
no
leisure
now
for
any
consciousness
of
how
matters
went
with
myself
his
delusion
was
not
wonderful
but
most
natural
she
was
clothed
in
black
from
head
to
foot
instead
of
the
white
dress
of
the
portrait
she
had
no
knowledge
of
the
conflict
of
nothing
but
that
she
was
called
for
that
her
fate
might
depend
on
the
next
few
minutes
in
her
eyes
there
was
a
pathetic
question
a
line
of
anxiety
in
the
lids
an
innocent
appeal
in
the
looks
and
the
face
the
same
the
same
lips
sensitive
ready
to
quiver
the
same
innocent
candid
brow
the
look
of
a
common
race
which
is
more
subtle
than
mere
resemblance
how
i
knew
that
it
was
so
i
can
not
tell
nor
any
man
it
was
the
other
the
elder
ah
no
not
elder
the
ever
young
the
agnes
to
whom
age
can
never
come
she
who
they
say
was
the
mother
of
a
man
who
never
saw
her
it
was
she
who
led
her
kinswoman
her
representative
into
our
hearts
my
father
recovered
after
a
few
days
he
had
taken
cold
it
was
said
the
day
before
and
naturally
at
seventy
a
small
matter
is
enough
to
upset
the
balance
even
of
a
strong
man
he
got
quite
well
but
he
was
willing
enough
afterwards
to
leave
the
management
of
that
ticklish
kind
of
property
which
involves
human
in
my
hands
who
could
move
about
more
freely
and
see
with
my
own
eyes
how
things
were
going
on
he
liked
home
better
and
had
more
pleasure
in
his
personal
existence
in
the
end
of
his
life
agnes
is
now
my
wife
as
he
had
of
course
foreseen
it
was
not
merely
the
disinclination
to
receive
her
daughter
or
to
take
upon
him
a
new
responsibility
that
had
moved
him
to
do
him
justice
but
both
these
motives
had
told
strongly
i
have
never
been
told
and
now
will
never
be
told
what
his
griefs
against
my
family
and
specially
against
that
cousin
had
been
but
that
he
had
been
very
determined
deeply
prejudiced
there
can
be
no
doubt
it
turned
out
after
that
the
first
occasion
on
which
i
had
been
mysteriously
commissioned
to
him
with
a
message
which
i
did
not
understand
and
which
for
that
time
he
did
not
understand
was
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
he
had
received
the
dead
letter
appealing
to
him
to
him
a
man
whom
he
had
wronged
on
behalf
of
the
child
who
was
about
to
be
left
friendless
in
the
world
the
second
time
further
letters
from
the
nurse
who
was
the
only
guardian
of
the
orphan
and
the
chaplain
of
the
place
where
her
father
had
died
taking
it
for
granted
that
my
house
was
her
natural
refuge
had
been
received
the
third
i
have
already
described
and
its
results
for
a
long
time
after
my
mind
was
never
without
a
lurking
fear
that
the
influence
which
had
once
taken
possession
of
me
might
return
again
why
should
i
have
feared
to
be
influenced
to
be
the
messenger
of
a
blessed
creature
whose
wishes
could
be
nothing
but
heavenly
who
can
say
flesh
and
blood
is
not
made
for
such
encounters
they
were
more
than
i
could
bear
but
nothing
of
the
kind
has
ever
occurred
again
agnes
had
her
peaceful
domestic
throne
established
under
the
picture
my
father
wished
it
to
be
so
and
spent
his
evenings
there
in
the
warmth
and
light
instead
of
in
the
old
library
in
the
narrow
circle
cleared
by
our
lamp
out
of
the
darkness
as
long
as
he
lived
it
is
supposed
by
strangers
that
the
picture
on
the
wall
is
that
of
my
wife
and
i
have
always
been
glad
that
it
should
be
so
supposed
she
who
was
my
mother
who
came
back
to
me
and
became
as
my
soul
for
three
strange
moments
and
no
more
but
with
whom
i
can
feel
no
credible
relationship
as
she
stands
there
has
retired
for
me
into
the
tender
regions
of
the
unseen
she
has
passed
once
more
into
the
secret
company
of
those
shadows
who
can
only
become
real
in
an
atmosphere
fitted
to
modify
and
harmonize
all
differences
and
make
all
wonders
possible
the
light
of
the
perfect
day
