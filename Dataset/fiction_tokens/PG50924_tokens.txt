sugardale
three
miles
the
state
highway
sign
said
dexter
foote
turned
into
the
side
road
that
the
arrow
indicated
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
it
at
the
time
but
by
his
action
he
condemned
his
new
convertible
to
a
fate
worse
than
death
the
side
road
meandered
down
a
long
slope
into
a
wooded
hollow
where
a
breeze
born
of
cool
bowers
and
shaded
brooks
made
the
july
afternoon
heat
less
oppressive
a
quantity
of
the
pique
that
had
been
with
him
ever
since
setting
forth
from
the
city
departed
there
were
worse
assignments
after
all
than
writing
up
a
fallen
star
abruptly
he
applied
the
brakes
and
brought
the
convertible
to
a
screeching
halt
his
blue
eyes
started
from
his
boyish
face
well
they
might
the
two
humpty
dumptyish
creatures
squatting
in
the
middle
of
the
road
were
as
big
as
heavy
tanks
and
judging
from
their
skin
tone
were
constructed
of
similar
material
they
had
arms
like
jointed
cranes
and
legs
like
articulated
girders
their
mouths
were
slightly
open
exposing
maws
the
hue
of
an
open
hearth
at
tapping
time
either
they
were
all
body
and
no
head
or
all
head
and
no
body
whichever
was
the
case
they
had
both
eyes
and
ears
the
former
had
something
of
the
aspect
of
peek
holes
in
a
furnace
door
while
the
latter
brought
to
mind
lopsided
tv
antennae
as
dexter
watched
the
foremost
of
the
two
metallic
monsters
advanced
upon
the
convertible
and
began
licking
the
chrome
off
the
grill
with
a
long
tongue
meanwhile
its
companion
circled
to
the
rear
and
took
a
big
bite
out
of
the
trunk
there
was
an
awesome
crunch
and
the
convertible
gave
a
convulsive
shudder
at
this
point
dexter
got
out
and
ran
more
accurately
he
jumped
out
and
ran
a
hundred
feet
down
the
road
he
stopped
and
turned
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
monster
no
bite
off
the
right
headlight
crunch
not
to
be
outdone
monster
no
bit
off
the
right
taillight
an
acrid
odor
affronted
dexter
nostrils
and
he
discerned
a
faint
yellow
haze
hovering
about
the
convertible
the
rear
wheels
went
in
two
bites
the
motor
required
three
the
upholstery
caught
fire
and
began
to
burn
a
gout
of
flame
shot
up
as
the
gas
tank
exploded
far
from
discouraging
the
two
monsters
the
resultant
inferno
merely
served
to
whet
their
appetites
dexter
shoulders
sagged
and
the
spot
next
to
his
heart
that
the
convertible
had
shared
with
his
best
girl
gave
a
spasmodic
twinge
removing
his
suitcoat
and
slinging
it
over
his
shoulder
he
turned
his
back
on
the
grisly
repast
and
set
out
sadly
for
sugardale
he
had
not
gone
far
before
his
stalled
got
into
gear
again
the
falling
star
he
had
been
assigned
by
his
editor
to
write
up
had
been
an
unusually
brilliant
one
according
to
the
report
the
paper
had
received
maybe
its
unusualness
did
not
stop
there
maybe
it
was
something
more
than
a
mere
meteorite
certainly
the
two
monsters
could
not
be
classified
as
local
woodland
creatures
all
of
which
was
fine
as
far
as
copy
was
concerned
but
it
did
bring
his
convertible
back
presently
he
saw
two
sizable
deposits
of
slag
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
approaching
them
more
closely
he
discovered
that
they
were
still
warm
could
they
be
the
remains
of
a
previously
devoured
automobile
he
wondered
what
an
ignominious
fate
indeed
to
overtake
a
car
he
looked
at
the
two
deposits
once
more
before
moving
on
all
he
could
think
of
were
two
piles
of
elephant
dung
a
mile
and
half
later
he
emerged
in
a
small
valley
that
sported
a
handful
of
houses
a
scattering
of
business
places
a
church
or
two
and
a
goodly
number
of
trees
a
roadside
sign
informed
him
that
he
had
reached
his
destination
that
its
population
was
and
that
its
speed
limit
was
mph
the
population
however
was
nowhere
in
evidence
and
the
speed
limit
seemed
silly
in
view
of
the
absence
of
cars
a
housewife
upon
whose
door
he
knocked
told
him
he
probably
find
the
local
minion
of
the
law
at
the
sugardale
inn
sucking
up
beer
the
way
he
always
is
when
he
should
be
out
earning
his
money
the
inn
turned
out
to
be
a
sagging
structure
in
desperate
need
of
a
there
was
a
model
a
sedan
parked
in
front
of
it
the
first
automobile
dexter
had
seen
formerly
the
establishment
had
provided
a
haven
for
weary
travelers
now
it
provided
a
haven
for
contented
cockroaches
its
de
bar
was
a
collector
item
and
standing
at
it
one
foot
propped
on
the
brass
was
a
lone
customer
he
was
tall
and
thin
and
somewhere
in
his
sixties
and
he
was
wearing
blue
denim
trousers
and
a
blue
chambray
shirt
there
was
a
lackluster
badge
pinned
on
the
fading
shirtfront
and
a
sombrero
sat
atop
the
graying
head
sheriff
jeremiah
smith
at
your
service
he
said
calmly
when
dexter
dashed
up
to
him
he
took
a
sip
from
the
schooner
of
beer
that
sat
on
the
bar
before
him
got
troubles
have
you
young
man
my
car
dexter
said
i
was
driving
along
the
road
and
got
ate
up
did
it
well
it
not
the
first
one
to
get
ate
up
around
here
jeremiah
smith
faced
the
doorway
that
led
to
the
lobby
creasy
get
this
young
man
a
beer
he
called
a
plump
woman
whose
dark
hair
fell
down
over
her
eyes
like
a
thicket
came
into
sight
behind
the
bar
she
flicked
a
cockroach
off
the
with
an
expert
forefinger
drew
dexter
a
schooner
and
set
it
before
him
jeremiah
smith
paid
for
it
drink
her
down
young
man
he
said
i
know
how
feel
if
car
got
ate
up
manfully
dexter
dispatched
half
the
contents
of
the
schooner
after
which
he
introduced
himself
and
explained
the
nature
of
his
mission
to
sugardale
i
never
figured
on
anything
like
this
though
he
concluded
you
must
have
made
it
through
just
before
the
was
set
up
jeremiah
said
you
were
lucky
dexter
started
at
him
lucky
i
lost
my
pshaw
what
a
car
to
a
newspaper
man
when
a
big
story
in
the
air
take
this
newspaper
fellow
i
saw
on
tv
saturday
night
he
big
stories
went
out
long
ago
dexter
said
newspapermen
work
for
a
living
the
same
as
anybody
else
get
back
to
my
car
are
you
going
to
do
anything
about
it
jeremiah
looked
hurt
i
already
done
everything
i
can
do
the
minute
i
saw
those
tanks
i
knew
it
was
a
job
for
the
army
and
the
state
police
agreed
with
me
so
we
notified
them
after
which
we
advised
everybody
to
stay
indoors
and
to
keep
their
cars
under
lock
and
key
all
we
can
do
now
is
wait
jeremiah
sighed
crazy
if
you
ask
me
tanks
eating
automobiles
i
imagine
dexter
said
thoughtfully
that
our
diet
would
give
them
pause
too
where
did
this
star
of
yours
fall
in
ed
hallam
north
timber
lot
take
you
there
if
you
like
not
much
to
see
though
just
a
big
hole
in
the
ground
dexter
finished
his
beer
come
on
he
said
the
model
a
parked
in
front
of
the
inn
turned
out
to
be
jeremiah
they
took
off
down
the
road
at
a
brisk
pace
wound
through
woods
dales
pastures
and
fields
dexter
had
the
remotest
idea
where
he
was
when
at
last
jeremiah
pulled
up
beside
a
grove
larger
and
darker
than
the
others
the
old
man
squinted
into
the
lengthening
shadows
seems
to
me
them
tanks
ought
to
make
better
reading
than
a
common
ordinary
falling
star
halfway
out
of
the
car
dexter
stared
at
him
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
do
see
the
connection
what
connection
dexter
got
the
rest
of
the
way
out
between
the
and
the
spaceship
of
course
jeremiah
stared
at
what
spaceship
oh
never
mind
dexter
said
show
me
the
fallen
star
it
was
in
a
clearing
deep
in
the
woods
or
rather
the
hole
it
had
made
was
peering
down
into
the
hole
dexter
saw
the
dark
pitted
surface
of
what
could
very
well
have
been
an
ordinary
if
unusually
large
meteorite
there
was
nothing
that
suggested
an
opening
of
any
kind
but
the
opposite
wall
of
the
crater
did
look
as
though
some
heavy
object
had
been
dragged
or
had
dragged
itself
up
to
the
level
of
the
clearing
the
underbrush
showed
signs
of
having
been
badly
trampled
in
the
recent
past
he
pointed
out
the
signs
to
jeremiah
see
how
those
saplings
are
flattened
no
human
being
did
that
i
bet
if
we
followed
that
trail
we
come
to
the
remains
of
the
first
car
they
consumed
whose
car
was
it
by
the
way
hopkins
new
buick
she
just
started
out
for
the
city
on
one
of
her
shopping
trips
she
was
so
scared
when
she
came
running
back
into
town
her
hair
was
standing
straight
out
behind
her
head
maybe
though
it
was
because
she
was
running
so
fast
abruptly
jeremiah
leaned
forward
and
squinted
at
the
ground
looks
almost
like
a
big
footprint
right
there
do
it
he
straightened
but
if
the
darn
thing
is
a
spaceship
like
you
say
how
come
it
buried
itself
because
whoever
or
whatever
was
piloting
it
did
or
could
decelerate
enough
for
an
orthodox
landing
dexter
explained
lucky
it
hit
the
clearing
if
it
had
hit
the
trees
you
have
had
a
forest
fire
on
your
hands
jeremiah
looked
worried
maybe
we
better
be
getting
back
to
the
road
i
feel
kind
of
guilty
leaving
my
model
a
sitting
there
all
alone
dexter
followed
him
back
through
the
woods
and
climbed
into
the
front
seat
beside
him
the
road
took
them
to
the
main
highway
and
not
long
thereafter
jeremiah
turned
off
the
highway
into
another
road
a
familiar
road
heralded
by
a
familiar
sign
that
said
sugardale
three
miles
two
slag
deposits
marked
the
spot
where
once
dexter
proud
convertible
had
stood
he
gazed
at
them
sadly
as
they
passed
suddenly
jeremiah
brought
the
model
a
to
a
screeching
halt
the
two
desecrators
of
the
american
dream
incarnate
were
in
the
midst
of
another
repast
the
victim
this
time
judging
from
the
star
and
the
color
scheme
was
an
army
staff
car
the
grill
and
the
motor
were
already
gone
and
half
of
the
roof
was
missing
yellow
haze
enshrouded
the
sorry
scene
and
the
countryside
was
resounding
to
a
series
of
horrendous
crunches
do
you
think
if
i
sort
of
zoomed
by
we
could
make
it
jeremiah
asked
i
hate
to
go
all
the
way
around
the
other
way
i
game
if
you
are
dexter
said
zoooooommmmmmm
the
two
monsters
did
even
look
up
you
think
my
model
a
was
good
enough
for
them
jeremiah
said
peevishly
count
your
blessings
look
there
someone
up
ahead
the
someone
turned
out
to
be
a
general
a
chicken
colonel
and
an
enlisted
man
jeremiah
stopped
and
the
trio
climbed
into
the
back
seat
ate
your
staff
car
did
they
general
he
chuckled
taking
off
again
well
that
the
way
it
goes
the
name
said
the
general
whose
face
had
a
greenish
cast
is
general
longcombe
and
i
was
on
my
way
to
sugardale
to
reconnoiter
the
situation
before
committing
any
troops
to
the
area
this
is
my
aide
colonel
mortby
and
my
driver
sergeant
wilkins
sheriff
smith
at
your
service
said
jeremiah
this
here
dexter
foote
who
came
to
sugardale
to
do
a
big
story
on
our
falling
star
tell
me
about
these
vems
of
yours
sheriff
general
longcombe
said
jeremiah
twisted
around
vems
monsters
colonel
mortby
interposed
he
was
a
small
man
with
a
pleasant
youthful
face
it
standard
army
operating
procedure
to
give
an
object
a
name
before
investigating
it
oh
jeremiah
twisted
back
again
saved
the
model
a
from
going
into
the
ditch
with
a
herculean
yank
on
the
wheel
well
dexter
here
seems
to
think
that
our
falling
star
is
a
spaceship
and
that
they
landed
in
it
and
i
inclined
to
believe
he
right
after
seeing
the
vems
in
person
i
inclined
to
believe
he
right
myself
colonel
mortby
said
i
think
that
what
we
have
to
do
with
here
he
went
on
presently
when
the
general
made
no
comment
is
a
form
of
life
capable
of
generating
an
internal
temperature
of
at
least
three
thousand
degrees
fahrenheit
the
acrid
odor
they
give
off
while
probably
arises
from
a
substance
analogous
to
our
gastric
juices
which
their
stomachs
supply
to
accomplish
only
in
this
case
consists
primarily
in
melting
down
the
metal
they
consume
and
in
isolating
its
waste
matter
after
which
the
pure
metal
is
reprocessed
into
tissue
and
the
waste
matter
is
thrown
off
in
the
form
of
slag
i
think
we
might
go
so
far
as
to
call
them
a
couple
of
animate
open
hearths
dexter
had
turned
around
in
the
front
seat
and
was
looking
at
the
colonel
admiringly
i
think
you
hit
the
nail
right
on
the
head
sir
he
said
general
longcombe
was
scowling
we
here
to
survey
the
situation
colonel
not
to
jump
to
conclusions
he
addressed
the
back
of
jeremiah
neck
i
trust
we
have
no
trouble
finding
suitable
accommodations
in
sugardale
sheriff
creasy
be
glad
to
put
you
up
at
the
inn
if
that
what
you
mean
jeremiah
said
creasy
was
more
than
glad
indeed
from
the
way
she
looked
at
the
two
officers
and
the
nco
through
her
thicket
of
hair
you
would
have
thought
they
were
the
first
roomers
she
had
in
months
discounting
the
cockroaches
of
course
the
general
said
petulantly
let
get
down
to
business
colonel
i
want
an
armored
company
brought
up
immediately
and
i
want
the
area
put
off
limits
at
once
have
the
sheriff
show
you
where
it
is
he
turned
to
sergeant
wilkins
sergeant
get
on
the
phone
as
soon
as
the
colonel
gets
off
it
and
arrange
for
my
personal
cadillac
to
be
delivered
here
first
thing
after
phoning
his
paper
dexter
headed
for
the
dining
room
and
sat
down
beside
general
longcombe
anything
new
on
the
vems
general
he
asked
general
longcombe
sighed
there
were
shadows
under
his
eyes
and
his
cheeks
showed
signs
of
sagging
they
still
in
circulation
scared
the
wits
out
of
a
couple
of
teenagers
and
ate
their
got
them
under
constant
surveillance
of
course
and
what
with
all
the
underbrush
they
trample
it
easy
enough
to
track
them
but
we
stop
them
they
eat
our
gas
grenades
and
our
fragmentation
grenades
and
they
impervious
to
our
tank
killers
and
our
antitank
mines
a
small
would
take
care
of
them
nicely
but
even
assuming
an
area
around
here
large
enough
and
isolated
enough
to
permit
us
to
use
an
there
no
way
of
herding
them
into
it
it
just
so
happens
that
there
is
such
an
area
jeremiah
smith
said
tillson
valley
about
ten
miles
south
of
here
you
have
to
vacate
old
man
tillson
of
course
but
he
be
glad
to
go
if
you
made
it
worth
his
while
he
has
grown
a
thing
but
weeds
anyway
since
he
got
his
pension
just
sits
around
all
day
and
sucks
up
beer
but
there
still
no
way
of
getting
the
vems
out
there
general
longcombe
objected
tell
me
general
dexter
said
have
they
eaten
any
of
your
jeeps
or
trucks
or
personnel
carriers
general
longcombe
shook
his
head
they
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
too
i
have
a
theory
dexter
said
the
look
that
promptly
settled
on
general
longcombe
face
made
no
bones
about
what
he
thought
of
presumptuous
young
reporters
with
theories
colonel
mortby
however
was
considerably
less
biased
it
wo
do
any
harm
to
listen
to
what
he
got
to
say
sir
he
pointed
out
and
it
may
even
do
some
good
it
be
at
least
a
day
before
the
ship
is
excavated
and
even
then
we
may
not
know
any
more
about
the
sort
of
life
forms
we
dealing
with
than
we
do
now
dexter
needed
no
further
invitation
i
think
it
pretty
clear
by
now
he
began
that
our
two
visitors
from
planet
x
are
attracted
by
metal
in
just
any
old
form
at
all
but
by
metal
in
the
form
of
new
or
nearly
new
automobiles
this
strongly
suggests
that
their
landing
was
unpremeditated
because
if
it
had
been
premeditated
they
would
have
come
down
in
a
section
of
the
country
where
such
metallic
concoctions
are
in
plentiful
supply
near
a
city
or
a
large
town
or
close
to
a
heavily
traveled
throughway
but
what
is
it
about
these
new
cars
of
ours
that
they
find
so
irresistible
let
try
an
analogy
suppose
that
one
of
us
has
gone
into
a
bakery
to
buy
a
birthday
cake
and
that
money
is
no
object
which
cake
is
he
most
likely
to
buy
the
answer
is
obvious
the
one
with
the
most
visual
appeal
to
return
to
our
visitors
from
planet
x
suppose
that
all
their
lives
they
been
eating
metal
in
various
but
uninspired
ingot
forms
the
metallic
equivalents
let
say
of
beans
and
bread
and
hominy
grits
now
suppose
they
find
their
way
to
another
planet
where
visual
appeal
in
metallic
creation
is
a
major
occupation
and
suppose
that
shortly
after
disembarking
from
their
spaceship
they
come
upon
a
new
convertible
would
they
react
in
the
same
way
we
would
react
if
all
our
lives
our
diet
had
been
confined
to
beans
and
bread
and
hominy
grits
and
traveled
to
another
planet
disembarked
and
came
upon
a
delicious
birthday
cake
just
begging
to
be
eaten
would
they
make
pigs
of
themselves
and
start
looking
for
more
cakes
but
if
it
the
ornate
nature
of
our
cars
that
attracts
them
why
did
they
eat
the
staff
car
colonel
mortby
asked
and
why
did
they
eat
the
teenager
hot
rod
and
our
gas
and
fragmentation
grenades
i
suggest
dexter
said
that
they
ate
the
staff
car
because
at
the
moment
there
were
any
other
cars
immediately
available
as
for
the
teenager
hot
rod
i
imagine
it
was
loaded
down
with
enough
chrome
accessories
to
sink
a
battleship
and
as
for
the
grenades
your
men
threw
them
at
them
first
did
they
not
colonel
mortby
nodded
i
see
what
you
mean
sort
of
like
throwing
candy
to
a
baby
i
buy
your
theory
mr
foote
and
now
if
i
may
dexter
continued
i
like
to
propose
a
means
of
getting
rid
of
our
unwanted
visitors
from
planet
x
general
longcombe
sighed
very
well
foote
go
on
you
mentioned
earlier
sir
that
there
was
no
way
of
herding
the
vems
into
an
isolated
area
however
i
think
there
is
a
way
suppose
we
were
to
remove
all
of
the
automobiles
from
the
vicinity
with
the
exception
of
one
and
suppose
we
were
to
park
that
one
in
the
middle
of
tillson
valley
as
bait
with
a
underneath
it
but
how
would
they
know
that
the
bait
was
there
through
association
dexter
said
all
of
the
automobiles
consumed
thus
far
were
in
operation
shortly
before
they
began
to
eat
them
so
by
now
they
must
have
established
an
unconscious
relationship
between
the
sound
of
the
motors
and
the
taste
of
the
metal
therefore
if
we
keep
the
bait
idling
and
set
up
a
system
to
amplify
the
sound
eventually
they
hear
it
their
mouths
will
salivate
and
they
come
running
general
longcombe
offered
no
comment
he
appeared
to
be
deep
in
thought
my
car
is
in
west
virginia
colonel
mortby
said
my
car
was
eaten
dexter
said
general
longcombe
opened
his
mouth
my
car
he
began
sergeant
wilkins
entered
the
room
and
saluted
smartly
the
cadillac
has
just
arrived
sir
he
said
old
man
tillson
readily
enough
once
he
was
assured
that
he
would
be
indemnified
not
only
for
his
ramshackle
house
but
for
the
young
mountain
of
beer
bottles
that
stood
in
his
back
yard
and
the
command
post
was
moved
forthwith
to
the
lip
of
the
valley
jeremiah
smith
was
allowed
to
go
along
as
an
observer
and
dexter
was
accorded
a
similar
favor
by
evening
everything
was
in
place
the
cadillac
parked
in
the
valley
center
had
something
of
the
aspect
of
a
lamb
resting
on
an
altar
of
crab
grass
buttercups
and
mustard
weeds
surrounding
it
were
half
a
dozen
floodlights
suspended
over
it
was
a
microphone
standing
next
to
it
was
a
pole
supporting
three
speakers
and
located
several
hundred
feet
away
was
a
tv
camera
beyond
this
impressive
display
old
man
homestead
could
be
discerned
and
beyond
the
homestead
rose
his
mountainous
collection
of
beer
bottles
colonel
mortby
came
out
of
the
tent
and
walked
over
to
where
dexter
and
jeremiah
were
standing
looking
down
into
the
valley
he
handed
each
of
them
a
pair
of
glasses
if
you
watch
the
blast
make
sure
you
wear
these
he
said
raising
his
voice
above
the
amplified
purring
of
the
cadillac
motor
you
be
glad
to
hear
that
the
two
vems
are
already
on
their
way
foote
our
squad
just
called
in
however
the
creatures
move
so
slowly
that
they
probably
wo
be
here
before
dawn
dexter
came
out
of
a
brown
study
one
thing
still
bugs
me
he
said
why
should
two
members
of
a
race
of
extraterrestrials
technically
intelligent
enough
to
build
spaceships
behave
like
a
pair
of
gluttonous
savages
the
minute
they
land
on
another
planet
but
you
explained
that
jeremiah
pointed
out
they
just
ca
resist
eating
american
automobiles
i
afraid
i
got
carried
away
by
my
analogy
civilized
beings
simply
do
go
running
across
the
countryside
the
minute
they
land
and
start
grabbing
up
everything
that
strikes
their
eye
they
make
contact
with
the
authorities
first
and
they
go
running
across
the
countryside
and
start
grabbing
up
everything
that
strikes
their
eye
colonel
mortby
grinned
you
got
a
good
point
there
foote
well
i
going
to
see
if
i
ca
grab
forty
winks
or
so
it
been
a
trying
day
me
too
jeremiah
said
heading
for
his
model
a
left
alone
dexter
wedged
a
flashlight
in
the
fork
of
a
little
tree
sat
down
in
its
dim
radiance
got
out
pen
and
notebook
and
began
his
article
solid
cheese
he
wrote
dexter
dawn
found
him
dozing
over
page
there
they
are
someone
shouted
jerking
him
awake
the
filthy
fiends
the
someone
was
general
longcombe
joining
him
dexter
saw
the
two
vems
they
were
moving
relentlessly
across
the
valley
floor
toward
the
helpless
cadillac
jeremiah
came
up
rubbing
his
eyes
colonel
mortby
could
be
discerned
through
the
entrance
of
the
tent
leaning
over
a
technician
shoulder
the
two
vems
reached
the
cadillac
and
began
licking
off
the
chrome
with
their
long
tongues
general
longcombe
went
wild
he
waved
his
arms
monsters
he
screamed
i
blow
you
to
kingdom
come
personally
and
stomped
into
the
tent
dexter
and
jeremiah
started
to
put
on
their
glasses
abruptly
thunder
sounded
and
a
shadow
darkened
the
land
looking
skyward
dexter
saw
it
the
ship
the
saucer
whichever
word
you
cared
to
apply
to
it
but
whichever
noun
you
chose
you
had
to
prefix
it
with
the
adjective
gigantic
for
the
ventral
hatch
alone
which
had
just
yawned
open
was
large
enough
to
accommodate
the
sugardale
methodist
church
in
the
tent
the
general
as
yet
unaware
of
the
presence
was
giving
the
countdown
in
an
anguished
voice
two
in
the
valley
the
two
vems
were
trying
vainly
to
extricate
themselves
from
a
huge
metallic
net
that
had
dropped
over
them
one
on
the
lip
of
the
valley
dexter
foote
was
grappling
with
an
insight
zero
pfft
it
was
a
dud
after
all
general
longcombe
said
they
cancelled
out
the
with
some
kind
of
a
ray
i
wonder
he
shook
his
head
wistfully
what
a
weapon
though
he
and
colonel
mortby
and
the
tech
were
standing
by
the
carcass
of
the
cadillac
dexter
and
jeremiah
had
just
come
up
my
theory
turned
out
to
be
a
little
bit
dexter
said
you
see
i
overlooked
the
possibility
that
our
children
are
necessarily
the
only
galactic
small
fry
who
run
away
from
home
and
get
themselves
in
dutch
my
analogy
still
holds
true
but
i
would
have
done
better
to
have
compared
our
automobiles
to
appetizing
candy
bars
or
easter
baskets
filled
with
jelly
beans
and
chocolate
chickens
the
general
regarded
him
blankly
i
afraid
i
do
follow
you
at
all
mr
foote
did
you
ever
turn
a
pair
of
hungry
kids
loose
in
a
candy
store
sir
understanding
came
into
general
longcombe
eyes
then
and
he
turned
and
gazed
sadly
at
his
chromeless
cadillac
i
wonder
if
they
have
castor
oil
on
planet
x
he
said
i
bet
they
have
its
equivalent
grinned
