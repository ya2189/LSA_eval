both
the
of
chareh

and
the
short
glaring
vista
of
desert

and
starved
young
acacias
which
led
to
the
black
hulks
of
shipping
in
the
canal
from
the
bar

came
orchestral
strains
ai

performed
by
a
piano
indoors
and
two
violins
on
the
pavement
the
sounds
contended
with
a
thin
scattered
strumming
of
cafe
mandolins
the
tinkle
of
glasses
the
steady
click
of
dominoes
and
backgammon
then
were
drowned
in
the
harsh
chatter
of
arab
coolies
who
all
grimed
as
black
as
nubians
and
shouldering
shovels
tramped
inland

stiff
with

left
him
as

not

that
chap
drawled
the
captain
of
the
lazily
noticing
the
uncertain
military
walk
of
the
young
man
clumsy
legs
his
uncouth
clothes
his
pale
visage
winged
by
blushing
ears
of

the
eitel
in
then
replied
cesare
and
they
let
the
young
teuton
vanish
in
the
vision
of
mixed
lives
down
the
lane
of
music
and
chatter
and
drink
he
passed
slowly
like
a
man
just
wakened
assailed
by
oriental
noise
and
smells
jostled
by
the
races
of
all
latitudes
and
longitudes
surrounded
and
solitary
unheeded
and
with
a
villager
awkwardness
among
crowds
he
made
his
way
to
a
german
dispatches
for
rudolph
hackh
he
inquired
twisting
up
his
blond
moustache
and
trying
to
look
insolent
and
peremptory
like
an
employer
of
men
there
are
none
sir
answered
an
amiable
clerk
not
at
all
impressed
abashed
once
more
in
the
polyglot
street
still
daunted
by
his
first
plunge
into
the
foreign
and
the
strange
he
retraced
his
path
threading
shyly
toward
the
quai
françois
joseph
he
slipped
through
the
barrier
gate
signaled
clumsily
to
a
boatman
crawled
under
the
drunken
little
awning
of
the
dinghy
and
steered
a
landsman
course
along
the
shining
canal
toward
the
black
wall
of
a
german
cramping
the
oar
along
the
iron
side
he
bumped
the
safe
on
deck
he
became
in
a
moment
stiff
and
haughty
greeting
a
fellow
passenger
here
and
there
with
a
salute
all
afternoon
he
sat
or
walked
alone
unapproachable
eyeing
with
a
fierce
and
gloomy
stare
the
squalid
front
of
wooden
houses
on
the
african
side
the
gray
desert
glare
of
asia
the
pale
blue
ribbon
of
the
great
canal
stretching
southward
into
the
unknown
he
composed
melancholy
german
verses
in
a
he
recalled
famous
exiles
camoens
napoleon
byron
and
essayed
to
copy
something
of
all
three
in
his
attitude
he
cherished
the
thought
that
he
clerk
at
was
now
agent
at
and
traveling
toward
a
house
with
servants
off
there
beyond
the
turn
of
the
canal
beyond
the
curve
of
the
globe
but
for
all
this
rudolph
hackh
felt
young
homesick
timid
of
the
future
and
already
oppressed
with
the
distance
the
age
the
manifold
placid
mystery
of
china
toward
that
mystery
meanwhile
the
ship
began
to
creep
behind
her
houses
funnels
scrubby
trees
slowly
swung
to
blot
out
the
glowing
mediterranean
and
the
western
hemisphere
gray
desert
banks
closed
in
upon
her
strictly
slid
gently
astern
drawing
with
them
to
the
the
bright
lane
of
traversed
water
she
gained
the
bitter
lakes
and
the
red
conical
buoys
like
beads
slipped
on
and
added
to
the
two
converging
dotted
lines
to
the
west
thought
rudolph
as
he
mourned
sentimentally
at
this
lengthening
tally
of
their
departure
and
tried
to
quote
appropriate
farewells
he
was
deeply
touched
and
pleased
by
the
sadness
of
his
emotions
now
what
does
byron
say
the
sombre
glow
of
romantic
sentiment
faded
however
with
the
sunset
that
evening
as
the
ship
glided
from
ruby
coal
to
ruby
coal
of
the
gares
following
at
a
steady
six
knots
the
theatric
glare
of
her
along
arsenically
green
cardboard
banks
rudolph
paced
the
deck
in
a
mood
much
simpler
and
more
honest
in
vain
he
tried
the
philosophy
of
youth
it
gave
no
comfort
and
watching
the
clear
desert
stars
of
two
mysterious
continents
he
fell
prey
to
the
unbounded
and
unintelligible
complexity
of
man
world
his
own
career
seemed
no
more
dubious
than
trivial
succeeding
days
only
strengthened
this
mood
the
red
sea
passed
in
a
dream
of
homesickness
intolerable
heat
of
a
pale
blue
surface
stretched
before
aching
eyes
and
paler
strips
of
pink
and
gray
coast
faint
and
distant
like
dreams
too
passed
aden
and
colombo
and
then
suddenly
he
woke
to
the
most
acute
interest
he
had
ignored
his
at
their
table
but
when
the
new
passengers
from
colombo
came
to
dinner
he
heard
behind
him
the
swish
of
stiff
skirts
felt
some
one
brush
his
shoulder
and
saw
sliding
into
the
next
revolving
chair
the
vision
of
a
lady
in
white
she
murmured
dutifully
but
the
voice
was
not
german
rudolph
heard
her
subside
with
little
flouncings
and
felt
his
ears
grow
warm
and
red
delighted
embarrassed
he
at
last
took
sufficient
courage
to
steal
the
first
showed
her
to
be
young
and
smartly
attired
in
the
plainest
and
coolest
of
white
the
second
not
so
young
but
very
charming
with
a
demure
downcast
look
and
a
deft
control
of
her
spoon
that
to
rudolph
eyes
was
splendidly
fastidious
at
the
third
he
was
shocked
to
encounter
the
last
flitting
light
of
a
from
large
eyes
not
devoid
of
amusement
she
laughs
at
me
fumed
the
young
man
inwardly
he
was
angry
conscious
of
those
unlucky
ears
vexed
at
his
own
boldness
i
have
been
offensive
she
laughs
at
me
he
generalized
from
long
inexperience
of
a
subject
to
which
he
had
given
acutely
interested
thought
they
always
do
anger
did
not
prevent
him
however
from
noting
that
his
neighbor
traveled
alone
that
she
must
be
an
englishwoman
and
yet
that
she
diffused
somehow
an
aura
of
the
far
east
and
of
romance
he
shot
many
a
look
toward
her
that
evening
and
when
she
had
gone
below
strategically
bought
a
cigar
sat
down
in
the
chair
to
light
it
and
by
a
carefully
shielded
match
contrived
to
read
the
tag
that
fluttered
on
the
arm
forrester
hongkong
afterward
he
remembered
that
by
early
daylight
he
might
have
read
it
for
nothing
and
so
for
economic
penance
smoked
to
the
bitter
end
finding
the
cigar
disagreeable
but
manly
at
all
events
homesickness
had
vanished
in
a
curious
impatience
for
the
morrow
miss
forrester
he
would
sit
beside
miss
forrester
at
table
if
only
they
both
were
traveling
then
she
might
be
a
great
lady
to
be
enamored
of
a
countess
now
a
cigar
after
all
was
the
proper
companion
of
bold
thoughts
at
breakfast
recalling
her
amusement
he
remained
silent
and
wooden
at
tiffin
his
heart
leaped
you
speak
english
i
sure
do
you
miss
forrester
was
saying
in
a
pleasant
rather
drawling
voice
her
eyes
were
quite
serious
now
and
indeed
friendly
confusion
seized
him
i
have
less
english
to
amuse
myself
with
the
ladies
he
answered
wildly
next
moment
however
he
regained
that
painful
mastery
of
the
tongue
which
had
won
his
promotion
as
agent
and
stammered
pardon
i
would
mean
i
speak
so
badly
as
not
to
entertain
her
indeed
you
speak
very
nicely
she
rejoined
with
such
a
smile
as
no
woman
had
ever
troubled
to
bestow
on
him
that
will
be
so
pleasant
for
my
german
is
shocking
dazed
by
the
compliment
by
her
manner
of
taking
for
granted
that
future
conversation
which
had
seemed
too
good
to
come
true
but
above
all
by
her
arch
provoking
smile
rudolph
sat
with
his
head
in
a
whirl
feeling
that
the
wide
eyes
of
all
the
were
penetrating
the
tumultuous
secret
of
his
breast
again
his
english
deserted
and
left
him
stammering
but
miss
forrester
chatted
steadily
appeared
to
understand
murmurs
which
he
himself
found
obscure
and
so
restored
his
confidence
that
before
tiffin
was
over
he
talked
no
less
gayly
his
honest
face
alight
and
glowing
she
taught
him
the
names
of
the
strange
fruits
before
them
but
though
listening
and
questioning
eagerly
he
could
not
afterward
have
told
loquat
from
pumelo
or
from
papaya
nor
could
this
young
man
of
methodical
habits
ever
have
told
how
long
their
voyage
lasted
it
passed
unreal
and
timeless
in
a
glorious
mist
a
delighted
fever
the
background
a
blur
of
glossy
white
bulkheads
and
iron
rails
awnings
that
fluttered
in
the
warm
languorous
winds
an
infinite
tropic
ocean
poignantly
blue
the
foreground
miss
forrester
her
white
figure
trim
and
dashing
her
round
blue
eyes
filled
with
coy
wonder
the
arch
innocence
of
a
spoiled
child
her
pale
smooth
cheeks
rather
plump
but
coming
oddly
and
enticingly
to
a
point
at
the
mouth
and
tilted
chin
her
lips
somewhat
too
full
too
red
but
quick
and
whimsical
he
saw
these
all
and
these
only
in
a
bright
focus
listening
meanwhile
to
a
voice
by
turns
languid
and
lively
with
now
and
then
a
curious
liquid
softness
perhaps
insincere
yet
dangerously
pleasant
questioning
hinting
she
played
at
motherly
age
and
wisdom
as
for
him
he
never
before
knew
how
well
he
could
talk
or
how
engrossing
his
sober
life
both
in
his
native
village
on
the
baltic
and
afterward
in
bremen
could
prove
to
either
himself
or
a
stranger
yet
he
was
not
such
a
fool
he
reflected
as
to
tell
everything
so
far
from
trading
confidences
she
had
told
him
only
that
she
was
bound
straight
on
to
hongkong
that
curiosity
alone
had
led
her
to
travel
for
the
delightful
change
you
know
from
all
such
formality
and
that
she
was
really
more
french
than
english
her
reticence
had
the
charm
of
an
incognito
and
taking
this
leaf
from
her
book
he
gave
himself
out
as
a
large
vaguely
important
person
journeying
on
a
large
vague
errand
but
you
are
a
griffin
she
had
said
as
they
sat
together
at
tea
pardon
he
ventured
wary
and
alarmed
wondering
whether
he
could
claim
this
unknown
term
as
in
character
with
his
part
i
mean
miss
forrester
explained
smiling
it
is
your
first
visit
to
the
far
east
oh
yes
he
replied
eagerly
blushing
he
would
have
given
worlds
to
say
no
griffins
are
such
nice
little
monsters
she
purred
i
like
them
sometimes
at
night
waked
by
the
snores
of
a
fat
prussian
in
the
upper
berth
he
lay
staring
into
the
dark
while
the
ship
throbbed
in
unison
with
his
excited
thoughts
he
was
amazed
at
his
happy
recklessness
he
would
never
see
her
again
he
was
hurrying
toward
lonely
and
uncertain
shores
yet
this
brief
voyage
outvalued
the
rest
of
his
life
in
time
they
had
left
penang
another
unheeded
background
for
her
arch
innocent
appealing
face
and
forged
down
the
strait
of
malacca
in
a
flood
of
nebulous
moonlight
it
was
the
last
night
out
from
singapore
that
veiled
brightness
as
they
leaned
on
the
rail
showed
her
brown
hair
fluttering
dimly
her
face
pale
half
real
half
magical
her
eyes
dark
and
undefined
pools
of
mystery
it
was
late
they
had
been
silent
for
a
long
time
and
rudolph
felt
that
something
beyond
the
territory
of
words
remained
to
be
said
and
that
the
one
brilliant
epoch
of
his
life
now
drew
madly
to
a
close
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
the
woman
asked
suddenly
gravely
as
though
they
had
been
isolated
together
in
the
deep
spaces
of
the
same
thought
i
do
not
yet
of
what
rejoined
rudolph
at
a
loss
of
all
this
she
waved
an
eloquent
little
gesture
toward
the
gulf
oh
he
said
of
the
world
yes
she
answered
slowly
the
world
life
her
tone
subdued
and
musical
conveyed
in
the
mere
words
their
full
enigma
and
full
meaning
all
this
that
we
see
who
can
tell
he
took
her
seriously
and
ransacked
all
his
store
of
philosophy
for
a
worthy
answer
a
musty
store
dead
and
pedantic
after
the
thrilling
spirit
of
her
words
why
i
think
it
is
is
it
not
all
now
the
substance
of
our
duty
pardon
i
am
obscure
versinnlichte
material
unserer
no
her
clear
laughter
startled
him
oh
how
moral
she
cried
what
a
highly
moral
little
griffin
she
laughed
again
but
this
time
it
was
like
the
splash
of
water
in
a
deep
well
and
turned
toward
him
that
curiously
tilted
point
of
chin
and
mouth
her
eyes
shadowy
and
mocking
she
looked
young
again
the
spirit
of
youth
of
knowledge
of
wonderful
brightness
and
unbelief
must
we
take
it
so
very
very
hard
she
coaxed
is
it
just
a
place
to
be
happy
in
as
through
a
tumult
he
heard
and
recognized
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
because
she
added
it
lasts
such
a
little
while
on
the
rail
their
hands
suddenly
touched
he
was
aware
of
nothing
but
the
nearness
and
pallor
of
her
face
the
darkness
of
her
eyes
shining
up
at
him
all
his
life
seemed
to
have
rushed
concentrating
into
that
one
instant
of
extreme
trouble
happiness
trembling
fascination
footsteps
sounded
on
the
deck
behind
them
an
unwelcome
voice
called
jocosely
good
efening
the
ship
doctor
advanced
with
a
roguish
paternal
air
you
see
at
the
phosphor
not
even
as
she
whipped
about
toward
the
light
rudolph
had
seen
with
a
touch
of
wonder
how
her
face
changed
from
a
bitter
frown
to
the
most
friendly
smile
the
frown
returned
became
almost
savage
when
the
fat
physician
continued
to
see
the

mrs
forrester
had
the
steamer
crashed
upon
a
reef
he
would
hardly
have
noticed
such
a
minor
shipwreck
forrester
why
then
when
the
doctor
after
ponderous
pleasantries
had
waddled
away
aft
rudolph
turned
upon
her
a
face
of
tragedy
was
that
true
he
demanded
grimly
was
what
true
she
asked
with
baby
eyes
of
wonder
which
no
longer
deceived
but
angered
what
the
doctor
said
rudolph
voice
trembled
the
tittle
the
title
he
gave
you
why
of
course
she
laughed
and
you
did
not
tell
me
he
began
with
scorn
do
be
foolish
she
cut
in
from
beneath
her
skirt
the
toe
of
a
small
white
shoe
tapped
the
deck
angrily
of
a
sudden
she
laughed
and
raised
a
tantalizing
face
merry
candid
and
inscrutable
why
you
never
asked
me
and
and
of
course
i
thought
you
were
saying
it
all
along
you
have
such
a
dear
funny
way
of
pronouncing
you
know
he
hesitated
almost
believing
then
with
a
desperate
gesture
wheeled
and
marched
resolutely
aft
that
night
it
was
no
prussian
snores
which
kept
him
awake
and
wretched
everything
is
finished
he
thought
abysmally
he
lay
overthrown
aching
crushed
as
though
pinned
under
the
fallen
walls
of
his
youth
at
the
ship
lay
still
beside
a
quay
where
mad
crowds
of
brown
and
yellow
men
scarfed
swathed
and
turbaned
in
riotous
colors
worked
quarreling
with
harsh
cries
in
unspeakable
interweaving
uproar
the
air
hot
and
steamy
smelled
of
strange
earth
as
rudolph
followed
a
malay
porter
toward
the
he
was
painfully
aware
that
forrester
had
turned
from
the
rail
and
stood
waiting
in
his
path
without
saying
she
reproached
him
the
injured
wonder
in
her
eyes
he
thought
a
little
overdone
he
could
not
halt
but
raising
his
cap
stiffly
managed
to
add
a
pleasant
voyage
and
passed
on
feeling
as
though
she
had
murdered
something
he
found
himself
jogging
in
a
rickshaw
while
equatorial
rain
beat
like
bullets
on
the
tarpaulin
hood
and
sluiced
the
oily
yellow
back
over
the
shoulders
he
caught
glimpses
of
sullen
green
foliage
ponderous
and
drooping
of
barbarians
that
squatted
in
the
shallow
caverns
of
shops
innumerable
faces
black
yellow
white
and
brown
whirling
past
beneath
other
tarpaulin
hoods
or
at
carriage
windows
or
shielded
by
enormous
dripping
wicker
hats
or
bared
to
the
pelting
rain
curious
odors
greeted
him
as
of
sour
vegetables
and
of
unknown
rank
substances
burning
he
stared
like
a
visionary
at
the
streaming
multitude
of
alien
shapes
the
coolie
swerved
stopped
tilted
his
shafts
to
the
ground
rudolph
entered
a
sombre
mouldy
office
where
the
darkness
rang
with
tiny
silver
bells
men
in
their
faces
calm
as
polished
ivory
were
counting
dollars
endlessly
over
flying
one
of
these
men
paused
long
enough
to
give
him
a
sealed
dispatch
the
message
to
which
the
the
midgard
ooze
had
thrilled
beneath
his
tardy
keel
zimmerman
recalled
the
interpretation
ran
take
his
station
proceed
at
once
he
knew
the
port
only
as
forlorn
and
insignificant
it
did
not
matter
one
consolation
remained
he
would
never
see
her
again
chapter

the
pied
piper
a
gray
smudge
trailing
northward
showed
where
the
scottish
oriental
sixteen
hundred
tons
was
disappearing
from
the
pale
expanse
of
ocean
the
sampan
drifted
landward
imperceptibly
seeming
with
sail
unstirred
to
remain
where
the
impatient
steamer
had
met
it
dropped
a
solitary
passenger
overside
and
cast
him
loose
upon
the
breadth
of
the
antipodes
rare
and
far
the
sails
of
junks
patched
the
horizon
with
umber
polygons
rudolph
sitting
among
his
boxes
in
the
sampan
viewed
by
turns
this
desolate
void
astern
and
the
more
desolate
sweep
of
coast
ahead
his
matting
sail
divided
the
shining
bronze
outpour
of
an
invisible
river
divided
a
low
brown
shore
beyond
and
above
these
the
strips
of
some
higher
desert
country
that
shone
like
snowdrifts
or
like
sifted
ashes
from
which
the
hills
rose
black
and
charred
their
savage
look
in
the
clear
light
of
an
almost
vernal
morning
made
the
land
seem
fabulous
yet
here
in
reality
thought
rudolph
as
he
floated
toward
that
hoary
kingdom
here
at
last
facing
a
lonely
sea
reared
the
lifeless
inhospitable
shore
the
sullen
margin
of
china
the
slow
creaking
of
the
spliced
oar
swung
in
its
lashing
by
a
yellow
man
his
incomprehensible
chatter
with
some
fellow
boatman
hidden
in
the
bows
were
sounds
lost
in
a
drowsy
silence
rhythms
lost
in
a
wide
inertia
time
itself
seemed
stationary
rudolph
nodded
slept
and
waking
found
the
afternoon
sped
the
hills
gone
and
his
clumsy
craft
stealing
close
under
a
muddy
bank
topped
with
brown
weeds
and
grass
they
had
left
behind
the
silted
roadstead
and
now
gliding
on
a
gentle
flood
entered
the
here
and
there
against
the
saffron
tide
or
under
banks
quaggy
as
melting
chocolate
stooped
a
naked
fisherman
who
swarthy
as
his
background
but
for
a
of
yellow
flesh
shone
wet
and
glistening
while
he
stirred
a
through
the
liquid
mud
faint
in
the
distance
harsh
cries
sounded
now
and
then
and
the
soft
popping
of
tiny
revolts
in
the
reign
of
a
stillness
aged
and
formidable
crumbling
walls
and
squat
ruins
black
and
with
mould
old
towers
of
defense
against
pirates
guarded
from
either
bank
the
turns
of
the
river
in
one
reach
a
her
sails
furled
lay
at

the
red
and
white

staring
from

black
prow
a
silly
monster
the
painted
tompions
of
her
wooden
cannon
aiming
drunkenly
askew
her
crew
wash
fluttering
peacefully
in
a
line
of
blue
dungaree
beyond
the
next
turn
a
cracked
sharply
close
at
hand
something
splashed
and
the
ruffled
body
of
a
snipe
bobbed
in
the
bronze
flood
alongside
hang
it
complained
a
voice
loudly
the
beggar
was
too
hallo
oh
i
say
gilly
gilly
ahoy
pick
us
up
there
a
good
chap
the
bird
first
will
you
and
then
me
a
tall
young
man
in
brown
holland
and
a
battered
stood
above
on
the
grassy
brink
oh
beg
pardon
he
continued
took
you
for
old
gilly
you
know
he
snapped
the
empty
shells
from
his
gun
and
blew
into
the
breech
before
adding
would
mind
then
that
is
if
you
bound
up
for
it
a
beastly
long
tramp
and
i
been
shooting
all
afternoon
followed
by
three
coolies
who
popped
out
of
the
grass
with
the
young
stranger
descended
hopped
nimbly
from
tussock
to
gunwale
and
perched
there
to
wash
his
boots
in
the
river
might
have
known
you
were
old
gilly
he
said
over
his
shoulder
wutzler
said
the
lay
off
signaling
for
sampan
before
breakfast
going
to
stay
long
i
am
agent
answered
rudolph
with
a
touch
of
pride
for
fliegelman
and
sons
oh
drawled
the
hunter
lazily
he
swung
his
legs
inboard
faced
about
and
studied
rudolph
with
embarrassing
frankness
he
was
a
young
englishman
whose
cynical
gray
eyes
and
thin
face
tinged
rather
sallow
and
oriental
bespoke
a
reckless
good
humor
life
sentence
eh
then
your
name
what
is
it
again
hackh
is
it
heywood
mine
so
you
take
zimmerman
place
he
off
already
and
good
riddance
he
a
bounder
charming
spot
you
come
to
i
daresay
if
your
fliegelmans
opened
a
hong
in
hell
you
might
possibly
get
a
worse
station
without
change
of
manner
he
uttered
a
few
gabbling
barbaric
words
a
coolie
knelt
and
with
a
rag
began
to
clean
the
boots
which
from
the
expression
of
young
heywood
face
were
more
interesting
than
the
arrival
of
a
new
manager
from
germany
it
will
be
dark
before
we
in
he
said
my
place
for
the
night
of
course
and
let
your
predecessor
leavings
stand
over
till
daylight
after
dinner
we
go
to
the
club
dinner
chicken
and
rice
chicken
and
rice
better
like
it
though
for
you
eat
nothing
else
term
of
your
life
you
are
very
kind
began
rudolph
but
this
bewildering
youngster
cut
him
short
with
a
laugh
no
fear
you
pay
me
your
firm
supplies
unlimited
liquor
much
good
that
ever
did
us
with
old
zimmerman
the
sampan
now
slipped
rapidly
on
the
full
flood
up
a
narrow
channel
that
the
setting
of
the
sun
had
turned
as
at
a
blow
from
copper
to
indigo
the
shores
passed
more
and
more
obscure
against
a
fading
light
a
star
or
two
already
shone
faint
in
the
lower
spaces
a
second
loomed
above
them
with
a
ruddy
fire
in
the
stern
lighting
a
glimpse
of
squat
forms
and
yellow
goblin
faces
it
is
very
curious
said
rudolph
trying
polite
conversation
how
they
paint
so
the
eyes
on
their
jonks
no
eyes
no
can
see
no
can
see
no
can
walkee
chanted
heywood
in
careless
formula
i
say
he
complained
suddenly
you
not
going
to
the
people
and
all
that
rot
we
already
fed
up
with
missionaries
their
cant
i
mean
no
allusion
to
cannibalism
he
lighted
a
cigarette
after
the
blinding
flare
of
the
match
night
seemed
to
have
fallen
instantaneously
as
their
boat
crept
on
to
the
slow
creaking
sweep
both
maintained
silence
rudolph
rebuked
and
lonely
heywood
supine
beneath
a
comfortable
winking
spark
what
i
mean
is
drawled
the
hunter
we
need
all
the
good
fellows
we
can
get
bring
any
new
songs
out
oh
i
forgot
you
a
german
a
sweet
little
colony
gilly
the
only
gentleman
in
the
whole
of
us
and
heaven
knows
he
not
up
to
ah
we
in
on
our
right
fellow
sufferers
we
see
the
blooming
village
of
stinks
he
had
risen
in
the
gloom
beyond
his
shadow
a
few
feeble
lights
burned
low
and
scattered
along
the
bank
strange
cries
arose
the
bumping
of
sampans
the
mournful
caterwauling
of
a
stringed
instrument
the
native
town
a
bit
above
he
continued
we
herd
together
here
on
the
edge
no
concession
no
bund
nothing
their
sampan
grounded
softly
in
malodorous
ooze
each
mounting
the
bare
shoulders
of
a
coolie
the
two
europeans
rode
precariously
to
shore
my
boys
will
fetch
your
boxes
called
heywood
come
on
the
path
sometimes
marshy
sometimes
clay
or
stone
flags
deeply
littered
led
them
a
winding
course
in
the
night
now
and
then
shapes
met
them
and
pattered
past
in
single
file
furtive
and
sinister
at
last
where
a
wall
loomed
white
heywood
stopped
and
kicking
at
a
wooden
gate
gave
a
cry
with
rattling
weights
the
door
swung
open
and
closed
behind
them
heavily
a
kind
of
empty
garden
a
bare
little
inclosure
shone
dimly
in
the
light
that
streamed
from
a
low
veranda
at
the
farther
end
dogs
flew
at
them
barking
outrageously
down
chang
down
chutney
cried
their
master
be
quiet
flounce
you
fool
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
house
they
leaped
upon
him
two
red
chows
and
a
bitch
knocking
each
other
over
in
their
joy
olo
he
catchee
plenty
lats
piped
a
little
chinaman
who
shuffled
out
from
a
where
lamplight
showed
an
office
desk
catchee
plenty
lats
no
can
my
compradore
ah

said
heywood
to
rudolph
ah
pat
my
friend

number
one
flickleman
boss
man
the
withered
little
creature
bobbed
in
his
blue
robe
grinning
at
the
introduction
you
welly
man
he
murmured
amiably
catchee
goo
plice
all
the
same
i
do
half
like
it
was
heywood
comment
later
he
had
led
his
guest
upstairs
into
a
bare
room
furnished
in
wicker
open
windows
admitted
the
damp
sea
breeze
and
a
smell
like
foul
from
the
river
marshes
where
should
all
the
rats
be
coming
from
he
frowned
meditating
on
what
rudolph
thought
a
trifle
above
the
sallow
brown
face
his
chestnut
hair
shone
oddly
and
vigorous
maskee
ca
be
o
boy
one
one
bamboo
to
our
better
acquaintance
said
rudolph
as
they
raised
their
glasses
what
oh
yes
thanks
the
other
laughed
any
one
would
know
you
for
a
griffin
here
hackh
you
not
forgotten
your
manners
yet
when
they
had
sat
down
to
dinner
in
another
room
and
had
undertaken
the
promised
rice
and
chicken
he
laughed
again
somewhat
bitterly
better
acquaintance
no
fear
you
be
so
well
acquainted
with
us
all
that
you
wish
you
never
clapped
eyes
on
us
he
drained
his
whiskey
and
soda
signaled
for
more
and
added
were
you
ever
cooped
up
yachting
with
a
chap
you
detested
that
the
feeling
you
come
to
here
stand
by
you
drinking
nothing
rudolph
protested
politeness
had
so
far
conquered
habit
that
he
felt
uncommonly
flushed
genial
and
giddy
that
urged
heywood
tapping
the
bottle
that
our
only
amusement
you
see
one
good
thing
we
can
get
is
the
liquor
damnose
bibimus
forget
how
it
runs
hearty
or
you
die
without
getting
your
revenge
you
are
then
a
cried
rudolph
with
enthusiasm
the
other
nodded
gloomily
on
the
instant
his
face
had
fallen
as
impassive
as
that
of
the
chinese
boy
who
stood
behind
his
chair
straight
rigid
like
a
waxen
image
of
gravity
in
a
blue
yes
of
sorts
young
fool
scrapes
debt
out
to
orient
same
old
story
more
debt
trust
the
firm
to
encourage
that
debt
and
debt
and
debt
tied
up
safe
transfer
finish
never
go
home
he
rose
with
a
laugh
and
an
impatient
come
on
might
as
well
take
in
the
club
as
to
sit
here
talking
rot
outside
the
gate
of
the
compound
coolies
crouching
round
a
lantern
sprang
upright
and
whipped
a
pair
of
into
position
heywood
his
feet
elevated
comfortably
over
the
poles
swung
in
the
lead
rudolph
followed
bobbing
in
the
springy
rhythm
of
the
long
bamboos
the
lanterns
danced
before
them
down
an
open
road
past
a
few
blank
walls
and
dark
buildings
and
soon
halted
before
a
whitened
front
where
light
gleamed
from
the
upper
story
mind
the
stairs
called
heywood
narrow
and
beastly
dark
as
they
stumbled
up
the
steep
flight
rudolph
heard
the
click
of
billiard
balls
a
pair
of
hanging
lamps
lighted
the
room
into
which
he
rose
a
low
gloomy
loft
devoid
of
comfort
at
the
nearer
table
a
weazened
little
man
bent
eagerly
over
a
pictorial
paper
at
the
farther
chalking
their
cues
stood
two
players
one
a
sturdy
englishman
with
a
gray
moustache
the
other
a
lithe
graceful
person
whose
blue
coat
smart
as
an
officer
and
swarthy
but
handsome
face
made
him
at
a
glance
the
most
striking
figure
in
the
room
a
little
chinese
imp
in
white
who
acted
as
marker
turned
on
the
a
face
of
preternatural
cunning
wutzler
said
heywood
the
weazened
reader
rose
in
a
nervous
flutter
underwent
his
introduction
to
rudolph
with
as
much
bashful
agony
as
a
mumbled
a
few
words
in
german
and
instantly
took
refuge
in
his
tattered
the
players
however
advanced
in
a
more
friendly
fashion
the
englishman
whose
name
rudolph
did
not
catch
shook
his
hand
heartily
hackh
is
a
welcome
addition
he
spoke
with
deliberate
courtesy
something
in
his
voice
the
tired
look
in
his
frank
blue
eyes
and
serious
face
at
once
engaged
respect
for
our
sakes
he
continued
we
glad
to
see
you
here
i
am
sure
doctor
chantel
will
agree
with
me
ah
indeed
said
the
man
in
military
blue
with
a
courtier
bow
both
air
and
accent
were
french
most
welcome
let
all
have
a
drink
cried
heywood
despite
his
many
glasses
at
dinner
he
spoke
with
the
alacrity
of
a
new
idea
o
boy
whiskey
suey
fai
away
bounded
the
boy
marker
like
a
hello
wutzler
off
already
the
little
old
reader
had
quietly
disappeared
leaving
them
a
vacant
is
he
weird
laughed
heywood
as
they
sat
down
comes
and
goes
like
a
ghost
it
is
his
chinese
wife
declared
chantel
preening
his
moustache
he
is
always
ashame
to
meet
the
new
persons
poor
old
chap
said
heywood
i
know
feels
himself
an
outcast
and
all
that
humph
with
us
quite
unnecessary
the
chinese
page
quick
solemn
and
noiseless
glided
round
the
table
with
his
ah
you
young
devil
you
another
weird
one
you
atom
see
those
bead

amended
the
other
englishman
as
they
set
down
their
glasses
a
strange
cry
sounded
from
below
a
stifled
call
inarticulate
but
in
such
a
key
of
distress
that
all
four
faced
about
and
listened
intently
kom
down
called
a
hesitating
voice
kom
down
and
they
sprang
to
the
stairs
and
clattered
downward
dim
radiance
flooded
the
landing
from
the
street

outside
a
smoky
lantern
on
the
ground
revealed
the
lower
levels
in
the
wide
sector
of

stood
wutzler
shrinking
and
apologetic
like
a
man
caught
in
a
fault
his
wrinkled
face
eloquent
of
fear
his
gesture
eloquent
of
excuse
round
him
as
round
a
conjurer
scores
of
little
shadowy
things
moved
in
a
huddling
dance
fitfully
hopping
like
sparrows
over
spilt
grain
where
the
light
fell
brightest
these
became
plainer
their
eyes
shone
in
jeweled
points

said
heywood
in
a
voice
curiously
forced
and
flounce
killed
several
this
afternoon
so
my
no
one
heeded
him
all
stared
the
rats
like
beings
of
incantation
stole
about
with
an
absence
of
fear
a
disregard
of
man
presence
that
was
odious
and
alarming
earthquake
the
elder
englishman
spoke
as
though
afraid
of
disturbing
some
one
the
french
doctor
shook
his
head
no
he
answered
in
the
same
tone
look
the
rats
in
all
their
weaving
confusion
displayed
one
common
impulse
they
sprang
upward
continually
with
short
agonized
leaps
like
drowning
creatures
struggling
to
keep
afloat
above
some
invisible
flood
the
action
repeated
multitudinously
into
the
obscure
background
exaggerated
in
the
foreground
by
magnified
shadows
tossing
and
falling
on
the
white
walls
suggested
the
influence
of
some
evil
stratum
some
vapor
subtle
and
diabolic
crawling
poisonously
along
the
ground
heywood
stamped
angrily
without
effect
wutzler
stood
abject
a
magician
impotent
against
his
swarm
of
familiars
gradually
the
rats
silent
and
leaping
passed
away
into
the
darkness
as
though
they
heard
the
summons
of
a
pied
piper
it
does
attack
europeans
heywood
still
used
that
curious
inflection
then
my

bitterly
what

heywood
his
compatriot
nodded
in
a
meaningless
way
the

he
answered

ventured
wutzler
timidly

the

it

ignored

all
stared
down
musing
at
the
vacant
stones
then
the
concert
off
night
mocked
heywood
with
an
unpleasant
laugh
on
the
contrary
gilly
caught
him
up

decided
we

need

under

the
desert
was
sometimes
gobi
sometimes
sahara
but
always
an
infinite
stretch
of
sand
that
floated
up
and
up
in
a
stifling
layer
like
the

rudolph
desperately
choked
continued
leaping
upward
against
an
insufferable
power
of
gravity
or
straining
to
run
against
the
force
of
paralysis
the
desert
rang
with
phantom
voices
chinese
voices
that
mocked
him
chanting
of
pestilence
intoning
abhorrently
in
french
he
woke
to
find
a
knot
of
smothering
him
to
his
first
unspeakable
relief
succeeded
the
astonishment
of
hearing
the
voices
continue
in
shrill
chorus
the
tones
chinese
the
words
in
louder
fragments
unmistakably
french
they
sounded
close
at
hand
discordant
matins
sung
by
a
mob
of
angry
children
once
or
twice
a
weary
fretful
voice
scolded
feebly
rudolph
rose
to
peep
through
the
heavy
jalousies
but
saw
nothing
more
than
sullen
daylight
a
flood
of
vertical
rain
and
thin
rivulets
coursing
down
a
tiled
roof
below

echoes

followed
his

rudolph
blushing
prepared
to
descend
into
the
gloomy
vault
of
ablution
charcoal
fumes
however
and
the
glow
of
a

on

on

carried
them
out
into
a
chill
rain
that
drummed
overhead
and
splashed
along
the
compound
path
in
silver
points
the
sunken
flags
in
the
road
formed
a
narrow
aqueduct
that
wavered
down
a
lane
of
mire
a
few
grotesque
wretches
thatched
about
with
bamboo
matting
like
bottles
or
like
rosebushes
in
winter
trotted
past
shouldering
twin
baskets
the
smell
of
fish
and
sour
betel
the
subtle
sweetness
of
opium
grew
constantly
stronger
blended
with
exhalations
of
ancient
refuse
and
as
the
chairs
jogged
past
the
club
past
filthy
groups
huddling
about
the
well
in
a
marketplace
and
onward
into
the
black
yawn
of
the
city
gate
assailed
the
throat
like
a
bad
and
lasting
taste
now
in
the
dusky
street
pent
narrowly
by
wet
stone
walls

seemed
to
fall
while
fresh
waves
of
pungent
odor
overwhelmed
and
steeped
the
senses
rudolph
chair
jostled
through
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
chinese
all
alike
in
the
darkness
who
shuffled
along
before
with
switching
queues
or
flattened
against
the
wall
to
stare
almost
nose
to
nose
at
the
passing
foreigner
with
chairpoles
backing
into
one
shop
or
running
ahead
into
another
with
raucous
cries
from
the
coolies
he
swung
round
countless
corners
bewildered
in
a
dark
leprous
nightmare
bazaar
overhead
a
slit
of
cloudy
sky
showed
rarely
for
the
most
part
he
swayed
along
indoors
beneath
a
dingy
lattice
roof
all
points
of
the
compass
vanished
all
streets
remained
alike
the
same
endless
vista
of
mystic
characters
red
black
and
gold
on
narrow
suspended
tablets
under
which
flowed
the
same
current
of
men
in
blue
and
dirty
white
from
every
shop
the
same
yellow
faces
stared
at
him
the
same
elfin
children
caught
his
eye
for
a
to
grin
or
grimace
the
same
shaven
foreheads
bent
over
microscopical
tasks
in
the
dark
at
first
rudolph
thought
the
city
loud
and
brawling
but
resolving
this
impression
to
the
hideous
shouts
of
his
coolies
parting
the
crowd
he
detected
below
or
through
their
noise
from
all
the
long
a
wide
and
appalling
silence
gradually
too
small
sounds
relieved
this
the
hammering
of
the
steady
rattle
of
a
loom
or
the
call
and
mellow
bell
of
some
burdened
hawker
bumping
past
his
swinging
baskets
filled
with
a
pennyworth
of
trifles
but
still
the
silence
daunted
rudolph
in
this
astounding
vision
this
masque
of
unreal
life
of
lost
daylight
of
annihilated
direction
of
placid
turmoil
and
multifarious
identity
made
credible
only
by
the
permanence
of
nauseous
smells
somewhere
in
the
dark
maze
the
chairs
halted
under
a
portal
black
and
heavy
as
a
gate
of
dreams
and
as
by
the
anachronism
of
dreams
there
hung
among
its
tortuous
symbols
the
small
familiar
placard
fliegelman
and
sons
office
heywood
led
the
way
past
two
ducking
chinese
clerks
into
a
sombre
room
furnished
stiffly
with
a
row
of
carved
chairs
against
the
wall
lighted
coldly
by
of
placuna
and
a
lamp
smoking
before
some
commercial
god
in
his
ebony
and
tinsel
shrine
there
he
said
bringing
rudolph
to
an
inner
chamber
or
dark
little
where
another
draughty
lamp
flickered
on
a
european
desk
here
your
cell
i
off
call
for
you
later
good
luck
wheeling
in
the
doorway
he
tossed
a
book
caught
you
may
as
well
start
in
eh
made
worse
to
his
departing
steps
rudolph
listened
as
a
prisoner
condemned
might
listen
to
the
last
of
all
earthly
visitors
peering
through
a
kind
of
butler
window
he
saw
beyond
the
shrine
his
two
pallid
subordinates
like
mystic
automatons
nodding
and
smoking
by
the
doorway
beyond
them
across
a
darker
square
like
a
flitted
the
living
phantoms
of
the
street
it
seemed
a
fit
setting
for
his
fears
i
am
lost
he
thought
lost
among
goblins
marooned
in
the
age
of
barbarism
shut
in
a
labyrinth
with
a
black
death
at
once
actual
and
mediaeval
he
dared
not
think
of
home
but
flung
his
arms
on
the
littered
desk
and
buried
his
face
on
the
tin
the
rain
trampled
inexorably
at
last
mustering
a
shaky
resolution
he
set
to
work
ransacking
the
tumbled
papers
happily
zimmerman
had
left
all
in
confusion
the
very
hopelessness
of
his
accounts
proved
a
relief
working
at
high
tension
rudolph
wrestled
through
disorder
mistakes
falsification
and
little
by
little
as
the
sorted
piles
grew
and
his
pen
traveled
faster
the
old
absorbing
love
of
method
and
dispatch
the
stay
the
cordial
flagon
of
troubled
man
gave
him
strength
to
forget
at
times
felt
shoes
scuffed
the
stone
floor
without
and
high
scolding
voices
rose
exchanging
unfathomable
courtesy
with
his
clerks
one
after
another
strange
figures
plump
and
portly
in
their
colored
robes
crossed
his
threshold
nodding
their
buttoned
caps
clasping
their
hands
hidden
in
voluminous
sleeves
my
speakee
my
goo
flien
chanted
each
of
these
apparitions
and
each
after
a
long
slow
discourse
that
ended
more
darkly
than
it
began
retired
with
fatuous
nods
and
smirks
of
satisfaction
leaving
rudolph
dismayed
by
a
sense
of
cryptic
negotiation
in
which
he
had
been
found
wanting
noon
brought
the
only
other
interval
when
two
solemn
boys
stole
in
with
curry
and
beer
eat
he
could
not
in
this
lazaret
but
sipped
a
little
of
the
dark
kirin
brew
and
plunged
again
into
his
researches
alone
with
his
lamp
and
rustling
papers
he
fought
through
perplexities
now
whispering
now
silent
like
a
student
rapt
in
some
midnight
fervor
what
ho
must
work
this
fashion
heywood
voice
woke
him
sudden
as
a
gust
of
sharp
air
makee
finish
the
summons
was
both
welcome
and
unwelcome
for
as
their
chairs
jostled
homeward
through
the
reeking
twilight
rudolph
felt
the
glow
of
work
fade
like
the
mockery
of
wine
the
strange
seizure
returned
exile
danger
incomprehensibility
settled
down
upon
him
cold
and
steady
as
the
rain
tea
at
heywood
house
was
followed
by
tobacco
tobacco
by
sherry
and
this
by
a
dinner
from
yesterday
the
two
men
said
little
sitting
dejected
as
if
by
agreement
but
when
heywood
rose
he
changed
into
gayety
as
a
man
slips
on
a
jacket
now
then
for
the
masked
ball
i
mean
we
ca
carry
these
long
faces
to
the
club
can
we
ladies
night
what
larks
he
caught
up
his
cap
with
a
grimace
the
lord
loveth
a
cheerful
liar
come
ahead
on
the
way
he
craned
from
his
chair
to
shout
in
the
darkness
i
say
if
you
can
do
a
turn
of
any
sort
let
the
women
have
it
all
the
fun
they
get
be
an
ass
like
the
rest
of
us
maskee
how
silly
mind
you
it
all
hands
these
concerts
no
music
but
the
click
of
ivory
and
murmur
of
voices
came
down
the
stairway
of
the
club
at
first
glance
as
rudolph
rose
above
the
floor
the
gloomy
white
loft
seemed
vacant
as
ever
at
second
glance
embarrassingly
full
of
europeans
four
strangers
grounded
their
cues
long
enough
to
shake
his
hand
nesbit
sturgeon
herr
kempner
herr
teppich
he
bowed
stiffly
to
each
ran
the
battery
of
their
inspection
and
found
himself
saluting
three
other
persons
at
the
end
of
the
room
under
a
rosy
lantern
a
gray
matron
stout
and
too
tightly
dressed
for
comfort
received
him
uneasily
a
girl
befriended
him
with
a
look
and
a
quiet
word
while
a
tall
man
nodding
a
vigorous
mop
of
silver
hair
crushed
his
hand
in
a
great
bony
fist
earle
heywood
was
saying
miss
drake
and
how
are
you
padre
dr
earle
boomed
the
giant
in
a
deep
and
musical
bass
we
are
very
glad
very
glad
his
voice
vibrated
through
the
room
without
effort
it
struck
one
with
singular
force
like
the
shrewd
kind
brightness
of
his
eyes
light
blue
and
oddly
benevolent
under
brows
hard
as
granite
sit
down
hackh
he
ordered
genially
and
give
us
news
of
the
other
world
i
mean
he
laughed
west
of
suez
smoking
allowed
here
try
that
he
commanded
them
as
it
were
to
take
their
ease
the
women
among
cushions
on
a
rattan
couch
the
men
stretched
in
long
chairs
he
put
questions
indolent
friendly
questions
opening
vistas
of
reply
and
recollection
so
that
rudolph
answering
felt
the
first
return
of
homely
comfort
a
feeble
return
however
and
brief
in
the
pauses
of
talk
misgiving
swarmed
in
his
mind
like
the
leaping
vermin
of
last
night
the
world
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
still
appeared
disorderly
incomprehensible
and
dangerous
the
plague
it
still
recurred
in
his
thoughts
like
a
sombre
motive
these
friendly
people
were
still
strangers
and
for
a
moment
now
and
then
their
talk
their
smiles
the
click
of
billiards
the
cool
commonplace
behavior
seemed
a
foolhardy
unconcern
as
of
men
smoking
in
a
powder
magazine
clearing
a
bit
outside
called
nesbit
a
little
wiry
fellow
with
cheerful
cockney
speech
he
stood
chalking
his
cue
at
a
window
i
say
what
the
matter

this
week

eh
gilly

wheezed
the
fat
sturgeon
with
something
like
enthusiasm
now
we
brighten
up
by
jove
that
good
news
that
worth
hearing
eh
heywood
rather
drawled
rudolph
friend
with
an
alacrity
that
seemed
half
cynical
half
enigmatic
a
quick
tread
mounted
the
stairs
and
into
the
room
rose
chantel
he
bowed
gracefully
to
the
padre
group
but
halted
beside
the
players
whatever
he
said
they
forgot
their
game
and
circled
the
table
to
listen
he
spoke
earnestly
his
hands
fluttering
in
nervous
gestures
something
up
grumbled
heywood
when
the
doctor
forgets
to
pose
behind
chantel
as
he
wheeled
heaved
the
gray
and
sturdy
shoulders
of
gilly
alone
called
the
padre
why
where
the
mem
he
came
up
with
evident
weariness
but
replied
cheerfully
she
very
sorry
and
sent
all
round
but
her
journey
you
know
she
i
hope
we
not
delayed
the
concert
last
man
starts
it
heywood
sprang
up
flung
open
a
battered
piano
and
dragged
chantel
to
the
stool
come
gilly
your
forfeit
the
elder
man
blushed
and
coughed
why
really
he
stammered
really
if
you
wish
me
to
heywood
slid
back
into
his
chair
grinning
proud
as
an
old
peacock
he
whispered
to
rudolph
peacock
voice
too
chantel
struck
a
few
jangling
chords
and
skipping
adroitly
over
sick
notes
ran
a
flourish
the
joined
the
circle
with
absent
serious
faces
the
singer
cleared
his
throat
took
on
a
preternatural
solemnity
and
began
in
a
dismal
gruff
voice
he
proclaimed
himself
a
miner
deep
deep
down
and
few
i
trow
of
my
being
know
and
few
that
an
atom
care
his
hearers
applauded
this
gloomy
sentiment
till
his
cheeks
flushed
again
with
honest
satisfaction
but
in
the
full
sweep
of
a
brilliant
interlude
chantel
suddenly
broke
down
i
can
not
he
declared
sharply
as
he
turned
on
the
squealing
stool
they
saw
his
face
white
and
strangely
wrought
i
had
meant
he
said
with
painful
precision
to
say
nothing
and
act
as
i
can
not
judge
you
what
i
feel
he
got
uncertainly
to
his
feet
hesitating
ladies
you
will
not
be
alarmed
the
four
players
caught
his
eye
and
nodded
it
is
well
that
you
know
there
is
no
danger
here
more
than
i
am
since
disinfected
monsieur
jolivet
my
compatriot
you
see
you
understand
yes
the
plague
for
a
space
the
distant
hum
of
the
streets
invaded
the
room
then
heywood
book
of
music
slapped
the
floor
like
a
you
left
him
he
bounced
from
his
chair
raging
you
pêng
my
cap
quick
as
he
was
the
girl
stood
blocking
his
way
not
you
heywood
she
said
quietly
i
must
go
stay
with
him
they
confronted
each
other
man
and
woman
as
if
for
a
combat
of
will
the
outbreak
of
voices
was
cut
short
the
whole
company
stood
like
homeric
armies
watching
two
champions
chantel
however
broke
the
silence
nobody
must
go
he
eyed
them
all
gravely
i
left
him
yes
he
does
not
need
any
one
personne
very
sudden
he
went
to
the
school
sick
this
morning
swollen
axillae
the
poor
fool
not
to
know
et
puis
enfin
he
is
dead
heywood
pitched
his
cap
on
the
green
field
of
the
the
poor
pedagogue
he
said
bitterly
was
going
home
sudden
hot
and
cold
like
the
thrust
of
a
knife
it
struck
rudolph
that
he
had
heard
the
voice
of
this
first
victim
the
peevish
voice
which
cried
so
weakly
for
a
little
silence
at
early
daylight
that
very
morning
a
little
silence
and
he
had
received
the
great
a
gecko
fell
from
the
ceiling
with
a
tiny
thump
that
made
all
start
he
had
struck
the
piano
and
the
strings
answered
with
a
faint
aeolian
confusion
then
as
they
regarded
one
another
silently
a
rustle
a
flurry
sounded
on
the
stairs
a
woman
stumbled
into
the
loft
sobbing
crying
something
inarticulate
as
she
ran
blindly
toward
them
with
white
face
and
wild
eyes
she
halted
abruptly
swayed
as
though
to
fall
and
turned
rather
by
instinct
than
by
vision
to
the
other
women
bertha
protested
gilly
with
a
helpless
stare
my
dear
i
could
stay
she
cried
the
amah
told
me
why
did
you
ever
let
me
come
back
oh
do
something
help
me
the
face
and
the
voice
came
to
rudolph
like
another
trouble
across
a
dream
he
knew
them
with
a
pang
this
trembling
miserable
heap
flung
into
the
arms
of
the
girl
was
forrester
go
on
said
the
girl
calmly
she
had
drawn
the
woman
down
beside
her
on
the
rattan
couch
and
clasping
her
like
a
child
nodded
toward
the
piano
go
on
as
if
the
doctor
had
had
stopped
heywood
was
first
to
obey
come
chantel
chantez
here
your
song
he
took
the
stool
in
fashion
and
struck
a
droll
simultaneous
discord
come
well
then
catch
me
on
the
chorus
pour
qu
j
finisse
mon
service
au
tonkin
je
suis
parti
to
a
discreet
set
of
verses
he
rattled
a
bravado
accompaniment
presently
chantel
moved
to
his
side
and
with
the
same
spirit
swung
into
the
chorus
the
tumbled
white
figure
on
the
couch
clung
to
her
refuge
her
bright
hair
shining
below
the
girl
quiet
thoughtful
face
she
was
shaken
with
convulsive
regularity
in
his
riot
of
emotions
rudolph
found
an
shame
a
picture
returned
the
strait
of
malacca
this
woman
in
the
blue
moonlight
a
mistress
of
life
rejoicing
alluring
who
was
now
the
single
coward
in
the
room
but
was
she
the
question
was
quick
and
revolting
as
quickly
a
choice
of
sides
was
forced
on
him
he
understood
these
people
recalled
heywood
saying
and
with
that
some
story
of
a
regiment
which
lay
waiting
in
the
open
and
sang
while
the
bullets
picked
and
chose
all
together
as
now
these
men
were
roaring
cheerfully
ma
tonkikí
ma
tonkikí
ma
tonkinoise
yen
a
qui
m
font
les
doux

mais

que
le

the
new
recruit
joined
them
awkwardly
chapter
iv
the
wutzler
was
missing
last
night
said
heywood
lazily
he
had
finished
breakfast
and
lighted
a
short
fat
glossy
pipe
just
occurred
to
me
we
must
have
a
look
in
on
him
poor
old
wutz
he
getting
worse
and
worse
chantel
right
i
fancy
it
the
native
wife
he
rose
with
a
short
laugh
queer
the
rest
never
feel
so
nesbit
and
sturgeon
and
that
lot
but
then
they
do
fall
so
low
as
to
marry
theirs
by
the
way
he
sneered
on
the
landing
until
this
scare
blows
over
you
better
postpone
any
such
establishment
if
you
intend
i
do
not
stammered
rudolph
to
his
amazement
the
other
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
i
say
the
sallow
face
and
cynical
gray
eyes
lighted
for
the
first
time
with
something
like
enthusiasm
next
moment
they
had
darkened
again
but
not
before
he
had
said
gruffly
you
not
a
bad
little
chap
morosely
as
if
ashamed
of
this
outburst
he
led
the
way
through
the
bare
sunny
compound
and
when
the
gate
had
closed
rattling
behind
them
stated
their
plans
concisely
and
sourly
no
work
not
a
stroke
we
just
make
it
a
holiday
catchee
good
what
no
rot
i
wo
work
and
you
ca
that
all
there
is
about
that
do
be
an
ass
come
along
we
go
out
first
and
see
captain
kneebone
and
when
rudolph
faithful
to
certain
tradesmen
snoring
in
bremen
would
have
protested
mildly
he
let
fly
a
stinging
retort
and
did
not
regain
his
temper
until
they
had
passed
the
outskirts
of
the
village
yet
even
the
quarrel
seemed
part
of
some
better
understanding
some
new
subtle
bond
between
two
lonely
men
before
them
opened
a
broad
field
dotted
with
curious
white
disks
like
bone
buttons
thrown
on
a
green
carpet
near
at
hand
coolies
trotted
and
stooped
laying
out
more
of
these
circular
baskets
filled
with
tiny
makers
of
said
heywood
as
he
strode
along
explaining
he
threw
off
his
surly
fit
the
brilliant
sunlight
the
breeze
stirring
toward
them
from
a
background
of
drooping
bamboos
the
gabble
of
coolies
the
faint
aroma
of
the
fermenting
cakes
began
after
all
to
give
a
truant
sense
of
holiday
almost
gayly
the
companions
threaded
a
marshy
path
to
the
river
and
bargained
with
a
shrewd
plump
woman
who
squatted
in
the
bow
of
a
sampan
she
chaffered
angrily
then
laughed
at
some
unknown
saying
of
heywood
and
let
them
come
aboard
summoned
by
voluble
scolding
her
husband
appeared
and
placidly
labored
at
the
creaking
sweep
they
slipped
down
a
river
of
bronze
between
the
oozy
banks
and
the
the
naked
fisherman
the
ruins
of
forts
drifted
past
like
things
in
reverie
while
the
men
lay
smoking
basking
in
bright
weather
they
looked
up
into
serene
spaces
and
forgot
the
umbra
of
pestilence
heywood
now
lazy
now
animated
exchanged
barbaric
words
with
the
as
their
tones
rose
and
fell
she
laughed
long
afterward
rudolph
was
to
remember
her
a
wholesome
capable
figure
in
faded
blue
darting
keen
glances
from
her
beady
eyes
flashing
her
white
teeth
in
a
smile
or
laughing
till
the
green
pendants
of
false
jade
trembled
in
her
ears
her
name
is
wu
said
heywood
between
and
she
is
a
lady
of
humor
we
are
discussing
the
latest
lawsuit
which
she
describes
as
suing
a
flea
and
winning
the
bite
her
maiden
name
was
the
pretty
lily
she
is
captain
of
this
sampan
and
fears
that
her
husband
does
not
rate
a
b
where
the
river
disembogued
the
pretty
lily
cursing
and
shrilling
pattering
barefoot
about
her
craft
set
a
matting
sail
and
caught
the
breeze
over
the
copper
surface
of
the
roadstead
the
sampan
drew
out
handily
ahead
a
black
disreputable
little
steamer
lay
anchored
her
name
two
enormous
hieroglyphics
painted
amidships
staring
a
bilious
yellow
in
the
morning
sun
under
these
at
last
the
sampan
came
bumping
unperceived
or
neglected
overhead
a
pair
of
white
shoes
protruded
from
the
rail
in
a
blue
film
of
smoke
they
twitched
as
a
dry
cackle
of
laughter
broke
out
kut
sing
ahoy
shouted
heywood
on
deck
kneebone
the
shoes
whipped
inboard
outboard
popped
a
ruddy
little
face
set
in
the
green
circle
of
a
and
contorted
with
laughter
listen
to
this
will
ye
cried
the
apparition
as
though
illustrating
a
point
leaning
his
white
sleeves
on
the
rail
cigar
in
one
fist
tauchnitz
volume
in
the
other
he
roared
down
over
the
side
a
passage
of
prose
from
which
his
visitors
caught
only
the
words
ginger
dick
and
peter
russet
before
mirth
strangled
him
god
bless
a
man
he
cried
choking
that
can
make
a
lonesome
old
beggar
laugh
out
here
eh
what
how
he
ever
thinks
up
but
he
took
to
writing
plays
they
tell
me
plays
he
scowled
ferociously
fat
lot
o
good
they
are
for
skippers
and
planters
and
gory
exiles
eh
what
i
write
him
a
chit
tell
him
plays
be
damned
we
want
more
stories
red
and
savage
he
hurled
the
book
fluttering
into
the
sea
then
swore
in
consternation
oh
i
say
he
wailed
fish
her
out
i
not
finished
her
my
intention
was
ye
know
to
fling
the
bloomin
cigar
heywood
laughing
rescued
the
volume
on
a
long
bamboo
just
came
out
on
the
captain
he
called
up
ca
board
you

plague

the
little
captain
that
hole
no

up
ye
goatskin
robinson
crusoe
and
get
a
white
man
chow
he
received
them
on
deck
a
red
peppery
little
officer
whose
shaven
cheeks
and
close
gray
hair
gave
him
the
look
of
a
parson
gone
wrong
a
run
away
to
sea
two
tall
chinese
boys
scurried
about
with
wicker
chairs
with
trays
of
bottles
ice
and
cheroots
while
he
barked
his
orders
like
a
commanding
a
pair
of
solemn
the
white
men
soon
lounged
beside
the
so
you
brought
forrester
drawled
heywood
rudolph
wondering
if
they
saw
him
wince
listened
with
painful
eagerness
but
the
captain
disposed
of
that
subject
very
simply
no
good
he
stared
up
at
the
grimy
awning
what
i
thinking
is
will
that
there
dacca
babu
at
koprah
slip
me
through
his
blessed
quarantine
for
dollars
what
their
talk
drifted
far
away
from
rudolph
far
from
china
itself
to
touch
a
hundred
ports
and
islands
cebu
and
sourabaya
tavoy
and
selangor
they
talked
of
men
and
women
a
death
at
zamboanga
a
birth
at
chittagong
of
obscure
heroism
or
suicide
and
fortunes
made
or
lost
while
the
two
boys
gentle
melancholy
gliding
silent
in
bright
blue
robes
spread
a
white
tablecloth
clamped
it
with
shining
brass
and
laid
the
tiffin
then
the
talk
flowed
on
the
feast
made
a
tiny
clatter
of
jollity
in
the
slumbering
noon
in
the
silence
of
an
ocean
and
a
continent
and
when
at
last
the
visitors
clambered
down
the
iron
side
they
went
victorious
with
spanish
wine
mind
ye
shouted
captain
kneebone
from
the
rail
that
do
half
exhaust
the
subjeck
o
why
luck
he
shook
both
fists
aloft
triumphantly
as
if
they
had
been
full
of
money
just
ye
wait
i
a
tip
from
calcutta
that
never
mind
bar
sells
when
that
comes
my
boy
the
half
yours
home
we
go
remember
that
the
sampan
drew
away
sweeping
his
arm
violently
to
threaten
the
coast
of
china
and
the
whole
range
of
his
vision
you
the
one
man
he
roared
that
makes
all
this
mess
worth
a
cowrie
heywood
laughed
waved
his
helmet
and
when
at
last
he
turned
sat
looking
downward
with
a
queer
smile
illusions
he
chuckled
what
would
a
chap
ever
do
without
old
kneebone
there
his
was
always
that
a
fortune
in
a
lottery
and
then
home
illusions
and
he
no
fool
either
good
navigator
decent
old
beggar
he
waved
his
helmet
again
before
stretching
out
to
sleep
do
you
know
i
believe
he
take
me
the
clinkered
hills
quivering
in
the
west
sank
gradually
into
the
heated
blur
above
the
plains
as
gradually
the
two
men
sank
into
dreams
furious
metallic
cries
from
the
pretty
lily
woke
them
in
the
blue
twilight
she
had
moored
her
sampan
alongside
a
flight
of
stone
steps
up
which
vigorously
with
a
bamboo
she
now
prodded
her
husband
he
contended
snarling
but
mounted
and
when
heywood
silver
fell
jingling
into
her
palm
lighted
his
lantern
and
scuffed
along
a
churlish
guide
at
the
head
of
the
slimy
stairs
heywood
rattled
a
ponderous
gate
in
a
wall
and
shouted
some
one
came
running
shot
bolts
and
swung
the
door
inward
the
lantern
showed
the
tawny
grinning
face
of
a
servant
as
they
passed
into
a
small
garden
of
dwarf
orange
trees
pent
in
by
a
lofty
whitewashed
wall
these
grounds
are
yours
hackh
said
heywood
your
predecessor
boy
and
there
pointing
to
a
lonely
barrack
that
loomed
white
over
the
stunted
grove
there
your
house
you
draw
the
largest
in
the
station
a
portuguese
nunnery
it
was
built
years
ago
my
boys
are
helping
set
it
to
rights
but
if
you
do
mind
i
like
you
to
stay
on
at
my
beastly
hut
until
this
this
business
takes
a
turn
plenty
of
time
he
nodded
at
the
fat
little
orange
trees
we
may
live
to
take
our
chow
under
those
yet
of
an
evening
also
a
drink
eh
the
lantern
skipped
before
them
across
the
garden
through
a
penitential
courtyard
and
under
a
vaulted
way
to
the
main
door
and
the
road
with
rudolph
the
obscure
garden
and
echoing
house
left
a
sense
of
magical
ownership
sudden
and
fleeting
like
riches
in
the
arabian
nights
the
road
leaving
on
the
right
a
low
hill
or
convex
field
that
heaved
against
the
lower
stars
now
led
the
wanderers
down
a
lane
of
hovels
among
dim
squares
of
smoky
lamplight
wu
their
had
turned
back
and
they
had
begun
to
pass
a
few
quiet
expectant
shops
when
a
screaming
voice
ahead
outraged
the
evening
stillness
at
the
first
words
heywood
doubled
his
pace
come
along
here
a
lark
or
a
tragedy
jostling
through
a
malodorous
crowd
that
blockaded
the
quarrel
they
gained
the
threshold
of
a
lighted
shop
against
a
rank
of
orderly
shelves
a
fat
merchant
stood
at
bay
silent
apprehensive
before
him
like
an
actor
in
a
mad
scene
a
sobbing
ruffian
naked
to
the
waist
convulsed
with
passion
brandished
wild
fists
and
ranted
with
incredible
sounds
when
breath
failed
he
staggered
gasping
and
swept
his
audience
with
the
glazed
unmeaning
stare
of
drink
or
lunacy
the
merchant
spoke
up
timid
and
deprecating
as
though
the
words
were
vitriol
the
other
started
whirled
face
to
face
and
was
seized
with
a
new
raving
something
protruded
at
his
waistband
like
a
rudimentary
darwinian
stump
to
this
all
at
once
his
hand
flung
back
with
a
wrench
and
a
glitter
he
flourished
a
blade
above
his
head
heywood
sprang
to
intervene
in
the
same
instant
that
the
disturber
of
trade
swept
his
arm
down
in
frenzy
against
his
own
body
hilt
and
fist
thumped
home
with
the
sound
as
of
a
football
lightly
punted
he
turned
with
a
freezing
look
of
surprise
plucked
at
the
haft
made
one
step
calmly
and
tentatively
toward
the
door
stumbled
and
lay
retching
and
coughing
the
fat
wailed
like
a
man
beside
himself
he
gabbled
imploring
heywood
the
young
man
nodded
yes
yes
he
repeated
irritably
staring
down
at
the
body
but
listening
to
the
stream
of
words
murmurs
had
risen
among
the
goblin
faces
blinking
in
the
doorway
behind
them
a
sudden
voice
called
out
two
words
which
were
caught
up
and
echoed
harshly
in
the
street
heywood
whipped
about
never
called
me
that
before
he
said
quickly
come
outside
he
flung
back
a
hurried
sentence
to
the
merchant
caught
rudolph
arm
and
plunged
into
the
crowd
the
yellow
men
gave
passage
mechanically
but
with
lowering
faces
once
free
in
the
muddy
path
he
halted
quickly
and
looked
about
might
have
known
he
grumbled
never
called
me
dog
before
or
man
he
set
on
rudolph
followed
his
look
in
the
dim
light
at
the
outskirts
of
the
rabble
a
man
was
turning
away
with
an
air
of
contempt
or
unconcern
the
long
pale
oval
face
the
hard
eyes
gleaming
with
thought
had
vanished
at
a
glance
a
tall
slight
figure
stooping
in
his
long
robe
he
glided
into
the
darkness
for
all
his
haste
the
gait
was
not
the
gait
of
a
coolie
that
said
heywood
turning
into
their
former
path
that
was
fang
the
very
clever
chap
of
the
two
most
dangerous
men
in
the
district
he
one
they
had
swung
along
briskly
for
several
minutes
before
he
added
the
other
most
dangerous
man
you
met
him
already
if
i
not
mistaken
he
no
less
a
person
than
the
reverend
james
earle
what
exclaimed
rudolph
in
dull
bewilderment
yes
grunted
his
friend
the
padre
we
must
find
him
and
report
he
strode
forward
with
no
more
comment
at
his
side
rudolph
moved
as
a
soldier
carried
onward
by
pressure
and
automatic
rhythm
moves
in
the
apathy
of
a
forced
march
the
day
had
been
so
real
so
wholesome
full
of
careless
talk
and
of
sunlight
and
now
this
senseless
picture
blotted
all
else
and
remained
each
outline
sharper
in
memory
the
smoky
lamp
brighter
the
blow
of
the
hilt
louder
the
smell
of
peanut
oil
more
pungent
the
episode
to
him
was
a
disconnected
unnecessary
fragment
one
bloody
strand
in
the
whole
terrifying
snarl
but
his
companion
stalked
on
in
silence
like
a
man
who
saw
a
pattern
in
the
web
of
things
and
was
not
pleased
chapter
v
in
town
night
in
that
maze
of
alleys
was
but
a
more
sinister
day
the
same
men
in
broken
files
went
scuffing
over
filthy
stone
like
wanderers
lost
in
a
tunnel
the
same
inexplicable
noises
endured
the
same
smells
under
lamps
the
shaven
foreheads
still
bent
toward
microscopic
labor
the
curtained
window
of
a
fantan
shop
still
glowed
in
orange
translucency
and
from
behind
it
came
the
murmur
and
the
endless
chinking
of
cash
where
fortune
a
bedraggled
goddess
split
hairs
with
coolies
for
poverty
or
zero
nothing
was
altered
in
these
teeming
galleries
except
that
turbid
daylight
had
imperceptibly
given
place
to
this
other
dimness
in
which
lanterns
swung
like
tethered
life
went
on
mysteriously
without
change
or
sleep
while
the
two
white
men
shouldered
their
way
along
a
strange
chorus
broke
out
as
though
from
among
the
crowded
carcasses
in
a
stall
shrill
voices
rose
in
unearthly
discord
but
the
rhythm
was
not
of
asia
there
goes
the
hymn
scoffed
heywood
he
halted
where
between
the
butcher
and
a
the
song
poured
loud
through
an
open
doorway
nodding
at
a
placard
he
added
here
we
are
religion
chapel
hear
yanging
is
a
gate
that
stands
ajar
that
being
the
case
in
you
go
entering
a
long
narrow
room
lighted
from
sconces
at
either
side
they
sat
down
together
like
schoolmates
on
a
low
form
near
the
door
from
a
dais
across
at
the
further
end
the
vigorous
white
head
of
earle
dominated
the
company
a
strange
company
of
lounging
chinamen
who
sucked
at
enormous
bamboo
pipes
or
squinted
aimlessly
at
the
vertical
inscriptions
on
the
walls
or
wriggling
about
stared
at
the
nudged
their
neighbors
and
pointed
with
guttural
exclamations
the
song
had
ended
and
the
padre
was
lifting
up
his
giant
voice
to
rudolph
the
words
had
been
mere
sound
and
fury
but
for
a
compelling
honesty
that
needed
no
translation
this
man
was
not
preaching
to
heathen
but
talking
to
men
his
eyes
had
the
look
of
one
who
speaks
earnestly
of
matters
close
at
hand
direct
and
simple
along
the
forms
another
and
another
man
forgot
to
plait
his
queue
or
squirm
or
suck
laboriously
at
his
pipe
they
listened
stupid
or
intent
when
some
waif
from
the
outer
labyrinth
scuffed
in
affable
impudent
hailing
his
friends
across
the
room
he
made
but
a
ripple
of
unrest
and
sank
gaping
among
the
others
like
a
fish
in
a
pool
even
heywood
sat
listening
with
more
attention
than
respect
for
once
he
muttered
rot
toward
the
close
however
he
leaned
across
and
whispered
the
old
boy
reels
it
off
rather
well
different
to
what
one
imagined
rudolph
for
his
part
sat
watching
and
listening
surprised
by
a
new
and
curious
thought
a
band
of
huddled
converts
sang
once
more
in
squealing
discords
with
an
air
of
sad
compulsory
and
diabolic
sarcasm
a
few
inquirers
slouched
forward
and
surrounding
the
tall
preacher
questioned
him
concerning
the
new
faith
the
last
a
broad
misshapen
fellow
with
hanging
jowls
was
answered
sharply
he
stood
arguing
received
another
snub
and
went
out
bawling
and
threatening
with
the
contorted
face
and
clumsy
flourishes
of
some
fabulous
hero
on
a
screen
the
missionary
approached
smiling
but
like
a
man
who
has
finished
the
day
work
that
fellow
and
welcome
to
our
street
chapel
hackh
that
fellow
he
glanced
after
the
retreating
figure
he
a
lesson
in
perseverance
gentlemen
a
merchant
he
has
a
lawsuit
coming
on
notorious
and
tries
to
join
us
for
protection
cheaper
to
buy
a
little
belief
you
know
than
to
pay
yamên
fines
every
night
he
turns
up
grinning
and
bland
i
tell
him
it
wo
do
and
out
he
goes
snorting
like
a
dragon
rudolph
impulse
came
to
a
head
earle
he
stammered
i
owe
you
a
gratitude
you
spoke
to
these
people
so
as
i
do
not
know
but
i
listened
i
felt
before
always
are
they
devils
images
and
after
i
hear
you
they
are
as
men
the
other
shook
his
great
head
like
a
silver
mane
and
laughed
my
dear
young
man
he
replied
they
remarkably
like
you
and
me
after
a
pause
he
added
soberly
images
yes
you
right
sir
so
was
adam
the
same
clay
the
same
image
his
deep
voice
altered
his
eyes
lighted
shrewdly
as
he
turned
to
heywood
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
quite
said
the
young
man
readily
if
you
do
mind
padre
you
made
number
one
talk
fast
bowling
and
no
wides
but
we
really
came
for
something
else
in
a
few
brief
sentences
he
pictured
the
death
in
the
so
like
winking
the
beggar
gave
himself
the
iron
fell
down
and
made
finish
now
what
i
pieced
out
from
his
own
bukhing
and
the
merchant
was
this
the
dead
man
was
one
a
some
of
his
best
birds
died
he
had
a
long
run
of
bad
luck
and
came
near
starving
so
he
contrived
rather
cleverly
to
steal
about
a
hundred
catties
of
hemp
the
owner
this
merchant
went
to
the
elders
of
neighborhood
who
found
and
restored
the
hemp
nearly
all
merchant
lets
the
matter
drop
but
the
neighbors
kept
after
this
cormorant
fellow
worked
one
beastly
squeeze
or
another
ingenious
baiting
devilish
rot
you
know
their
neighborhoods
better
than
i
well
they
pushed
him
poor
devil
showing
that
always
possible
no
bottom
he
brooded
and
all
that
till
he
thought
the
merchant
and
the
jesus
religion
were
the
cause
of
all
so
bang
he
goes
down
the
pole
gloriously
drunk
marches
into
his
enemy
shop
and
uses
that
knife
the
joke
is
now
on
the
merchant
eh
just
a
moment
begged
the
padre
one
thread
i
do
follow
the
religion
who
was
christian
the
merchant
well
rather
thought
i
told
you
said
heywood
one
of
yours
big
mild
chap
chok
chung
the
elder
man
sat
musing
yes
the
deep
bass
rumbled
in
the
empty
chapel
he
one
of
us
extremely
honest
i
i
very
sorry
there
may
be
trouble
must
be
sir
prompted
the
younger
the
mob
meanwhile
just
stood
there
dumb
mutes
and
audience
you
know
all
at
once
the
hindmost
began
squalling
dog
man
we
stepped
outside
and
there
passing
if
you
like
was
that
gentle
bookworm
mr
fang
fang
echoed
the
padre
as
in
doubt
i
heard
the
name
heard
why
doctor
cried
heywood
that
long
pale
chap
lives
over
toward
the
dragon
spring
confucian
very
strict
keen
reader
might
be
a
mandarin
but
prefers
the
country
gentleman
sort
bally
he
done
more
people
in
the
eye
than
all
the
yamên
hacks
and
all
their
false
witnesses
together
hence
his
nickname
the
earle
sharpened
his
heavy
brows
and
studied
the
floor
fang
the
he
growled
yes
there
will
be
trouble
he
hates
us
given
this
chance
humph
saul
of
we
not
the
roman
church
he
added
with
his
first
trace
of
irritation
always
occurring
this
thing
once
more
he
meditated
then
heaved
his
big
shoulders
to
let
slip
the
whole
burden
one
day
at
a
time
he
laughed
thank
you
for
telling
you
see
hackh
they
not
devils
the
only
fault
is
they
just
human
beings
you
do
speak
the
language
i
send
you
my
old
teacher
they
talked
of
things
indifferent
and
when
the
young
men
were
stumbling
along
the
streets
he
called
after
them
a
resounding
thanks
and
stood
a
resolute
gigantic
silhouette
filling
as
a
right
doone
filled
their
doorframe
the
entrance
to
his
deserted
chapel
at
his
gate
felt
rudolph
they
had
unloaded
some
weight
of
responsibility
he
had
not
only
accepted
it
but
lightened
them
further
girt
them
by
a
word
and
a
look
somehow
for
the
first
time
since
landing
rudolph
perceived
that
through
this
difficult
troubled
ignorant
present
a
man
might
burrow
toward
a
future
gleam
the
feeling
was
but
momentary
as
for
heywood
he
still
marched
on
grimly
threading
the
stuffed
corridors
like
a
man
with
a
purpose
no
dinner
he
snapped
catchee
bymby
though
we
must
see
wutzler
first
to
lose
sight
of
any
man
for
hours
nowadays
well
it
not
hardly
fair
is
it
they
turned
down
a
black
lane
carpeted
with
dry
rubbish
at
long
intervals
a
lantern
guttering
above
a
door
showed
them
a
of
the
dirty
path
a
litter
of
broken
withes
and
refuse
between
the
mouldy
wall
of
the
town
and
a
row
of
huts
no
less
black
and
silent
in
this
greasy
rift
the
air
lay
thick
as
though
smeared
into
a
groove
suddenly
among
the
hovels
they
groped
along
a
checkered
surface
of
the
flare
of
heywood
match
revealed
a
heavy
wooden
door
which
he
hammered
with
his
fist
after
a
time
a
disgruntled
voice
within
snarled
something
in
the
vernacular
heywood
laughed
who
afraid
wutzler
you
old
pirate
open
up
a
bar
clattered
down
the
door
swung
back
and
there
raising
a
lantern
of
oiled
paper
stood
such
a
timorous
little
figure
as
might
have
ventured
out
from
a
masquerade
of
gnomes
the
wrinkled
face
was
wutzler
but
his
weazened
body
was
lost
in
the
glossy
black
folds
of
a
native
jacket
and
below
the
patched
trousers
his
bare
ankles
and
of
straw
moved
uneasily
as
though
trying
to
hide
behind
each
other
kom
in
said
this
hybrid
with
a
nervous
cackle
i
thought
you
are
thiefs
kom
in
following
through
a
toy
courtyard
among
shadow
hints
of
pigmy
shrubs
and
rockery
they
found
themselves
cramped
in
a
bare
clean
cell
lighted
by
a
european
lamp
but
smelling
of
soy
and
asiatics
stiff
chairs
lined
the
walls
a
distorted
landscape
on
narrow
scarlet
panels
inscribed
with
black
cursive
characters
pith
flowers
from
amoy
made
blots
of
brightness
it
iss
not
moch
gentlemen
sighed
wutzler
cringing
but
i
am
glad
heywood
flung
himself
into
a
chair
not
dead
yet
you
rascal
he
cried
and
we
came
all
the
way
to
see
you
no
chow
either
oh
allow
me
mumbled
their
host
in
a
flutter
my
she
i
will
speak
i
go
bring
you
he
shuffled
away
into
some
further
chamber
heywood
leaned
forward
quickly
eat
it
he
whispered
whether
you
can
or
not
pleases
the
old
one
no
bounds
we
his
only
visitors
here

not

whiskey
wutzler
came
shambling
in
held
a
bottle
against
the
light
and
squinted
ruefully
at
the
yellow
dregs
i
will
gif
you
a
full
but
i
haf
not
he
dodged
out
again
they
heard
his
angry
whispers
and
a
small
commotion
of
the
household
brazen
dishes
clinking
squeals
titters
and
tiny
bare
feet
skipping
about
all
the
flurry
of
a
in
wonderland
once
near
the
threshold
a
chubby
face
very
pale
with
round
eyes
of
shining
jet
peered
cautious
as
a
mouse
and
popped
out
of
sight
with
a
squeak
wutzler
red
with
excitement
came
and
went
like
an
anxious
waiter
bringing
in
the
feast
here
iss
not
moch
he
repeated
sadly
but
there
were
bits
of
stewed
in
oil
steaming
buns
of
stuffed
with
dice
of
fat
pork
and
lumps
of
sugar
rice
puddings
boiled
in
wrappers
with
the
last
of
the
whiskey
in
green
cups
while
the
two
men
ate
the
shriveled
outcast
beamed
timidly
hovering
about
them
fidgeting
herr

he
suddenly
exclaimed
in
a
queer
strained
voice

not
know
how
dis
yong
man

he
hass
to

he
choked
turned
away
and
began
fussing
with
the
pith
flowers
but
not
before
rudolph
had
seen
a
line
glistening
down
the
cheeks
stuff
cadging
for
chow
does

acquire
merit
retorted
heywood
over
his
shoulder
you

he
winked
i
rather

box

still
whimpering
wutzler
dragged

a
corner
squatted
and
jerked
at
a

a
noise
of
ratchets

he
rose
and
faced
heywood
with
a
trembling
passionate
gesture
but
diss
yong
man
he
stand
by
der
oldt
fellow
the
streaming
eyes
blinked
absurdly
behind
him
with
a
whirring
sound
a
metallic
voice
assailed
them
in
a
gabble
of
words
at
first
husky
and
broken
then
clear
nasal
a
voice
from
neither
europe

from

mocked
them
insanely
with
squealing
guffaws
heywood
sat
smoking
with
the
countenance
of
a
stoic
but
when
the
laughter
in
the
box
was
silent
he
started
abruptly

zo
he
blubbered
something
incoherent
but
as
the
gate
slammed
they
heard
the
name
of
god
in
a
broken
benediction
they
had
groped
out
of
the
cleft
and
into
a
main
corridor
before
heywood
paused
that
devil
in
the
box
he
shook
himself
like
a
spaniel
queer
it
should
get
into
me
so
but
i
hate
being
laughed
at
by
anybody
a
confused
thunder
of
gongs
the
clash
of
cymbals
smothered
in
the
distance
maintained
a
throbbing
uproar
pierced
now
and
then
by
savage
yells
prolonged
and
melancholy
as
the
two
wanderers
listened
where
the
comfort
said
heywood
gloomily
of
knowing
worse
off
no
i
was
thinking
of
wutzler
then
talk
of
germs
why
over
there
it
goblins
they
scaring
away
think
behind
their
nets
and
thorns
what
wretches
women

and
kids
may
be
crouched
down
quaking
sick
with
terror
humph
i
do
mind
saying
for
a
moment
his
hand
lay
on
rudolph
shoulder
that
i
loathe
giving
this
the
satisfaction
i
hate
to
go
out
here
that

chapter

the

he
was
spared
that
inconvenience
the
untimely
rain
and
cold
some
persons
said
the
few
days
of
untimely
heat
following
had
drowned
or
dried
frozen
or
burnt
out
the
seeds
of
peril
but
accounts
varied
reasons
were
plentiful
soldiers
had
come
down
from
the
chow
city
inland
and
charging
through
the
streets
hacking
and
slashing
the
infested
air
had
driven
the
goblins
over
the
walls
with
a
great
shout
of
victory
a
priest
had
freighted
a
kite
with
all
the
evil
then
cut
it
adrift
in
the
sky
a
mob
had
dethroned
the
god
of
sickness
and
banished
his
effigy
in
a
paper
junk
launched
on
the
river
at
night
in
flame
a
geomancer
proclaimed
that
a
bamboo
grove
behind
the
town
formed
an
angle
most
correct
germane
and
pleasant
to
the
azure
dragon
and
the
white
tiger
whose
occult
currents
male
and
female
run
throughout
nature
for
any
or
all
of
these
reasons
the
town
was
delivered
the
pestilence
vanished
as
though
it
had
come
but
to
grant
monsieur
jolivet
his
silence
and
to
add
a
few
score
uncounted
living
wretches
to
the
dark
mighty
imponderable
host
of
ancestors
the
relief
after
dragging
days
of
uncertainty
came
to
rudolph
like
a
to
a
stoker
to
escape
and
survive
the
bare
experience
seemed
to
him
at
first
an
act
of
merit
the
deed
of
a
veteran
the
interim
had
been
packed
with
incongruity
there
had
been
a
dinner
with
kempner
solemn
full
of
patriotism
and
philosophy
a
drunken
dinner
at
teppich
another
and
a
worse
at
nesbit
and
the
banquet
of
a
native
merchant
which
began
at
four
on
tea
black
yearling
eggs
and
a
hot
towel
and
ended
at
three
in
the
morning
on
and
betel
served
by
unreal
women
with
chalked
faces
and
lips
simpering
and
melancholy
by
day
there
was
work
or
now
and
then
a
lesson
with
earle
teacher
a
little
aged
chinaman
of
intricate
refined
and
plaintive
courtesy
under
his
guidance
rudolph
learned
rapidly
taking
to
study
as
a
prodigal
might
take
to
drink
and
with
increasing
knowledge
came
increasing
tranquillity
as
when
he
found
that
the
hideous
cry
startling
him
at
every
dawn
was
the
signal
not
for
massacre
but
then
too
came
the
mild
excitement
of
moving
into
his
own
house
the
portuguese
nunnery
through
its
desolate
spaces
his
meagre
belongings
were
scattered
all
too
easily
but
the
new
servants
their
words
and
ways
not
only
kept
his
hands
full
but
gave
strange
food
for
thought
the
silent
evenings
timed
by
the
plash
of
a
frog
in
a
pool
a
cry
from
the
river
or
the
of
a
boy
improvising
some
endless
ballad
drowsy
noons
above
the
little
courtyard
bare
and
peaceful
as
a
jail
homesick
moments
at
the
window
when
beyond
the
stunted
orangery
at
sunset
the
river
was
struck
amazingly
from
bronze
to
indigo
or
at
dawn
flashed
from
to
flowing
brass
all
these
and
nights
between
sleep
and
waking
when
fancy
peopled
the
echoing
chambers
with
the
visionary
lives
now
ended
of
meek
brown
sisters
from
goa
or
macao
gave
to
rudolph
intimations
vague
profound
and
gravely
happy
as
of
some
former
existence
almost
recaptured
once
more
he
felt
himself
a
householder
in
the
arabian
tales
and
yet
when
his
life
was
growing
all
but
placid
across
it
shot
some
tremor
of
disquieting
knowledge
one
evening
after
a
busy
day
among
his
he
had
walked
afield
with
heywood
and
back
by
an
aimless
circuit
through
the
twilight
his
companion
had
been
taciturn
of
late
and
they
halted
without
speaking
where
a
wide
pool
gleamed
toward
a
black
fantastic
belt
of
knotted
willows
and
roofs
through
these
broke
the
shadow
of
a
small
pagoda
jagged
as
a
of
shark
teeth
vesper
cymbals
clashed
faintly
in
a
temple
and
from
its
open
door
the
first
plummet
of
lamplight
began
to
fathom
the
dark
margin
a
short
bridge
curved
high
like
a
camel
hump
over
the
glimmering
of
a
single
arch
close
by
under
a
drooping
foreground
of
branches
a
stake
upheld
an
oblong
placard
of
neat
symbols
like
a
cartouche
to
explain
a
painting
it
is
very
beautiful
ventured
rudolph
twisting
up
his
blond
moustache
with
satisfaction
very
sightly
i
would
say
picturesque
no
very
said
heywood
absently
willow
pattern
and
the
placard
so
finishing
so
artistic
that
says
eh
what
oh
i
was
listening
heywood
glanced
carelessly
at
the
upright
sentence
that
a
notice
may
not
be
drowned
in
this
pond
he
started
on
without
comment
without
reply
rudolph
followed
gathering
as
he
walked
the
force
of
this
tremendous
hint
slow
it
poisoned
the
elegiac
beauty
of
the
scene
alienated
the
night
and
gave
to
the
fading
a
yet
more
ancient
look
sombre
and
implacable
he
was
still
pondering
this
when
across
their
winding
with
a
quick
thud
of
hoofs
swept
a
pair
of
equestrian
silhouettes
it
was
half
glimpse
half
conjecture
the
tough
little
ponies
trotting
stubbornly
a
rider
who
leaned
across
laughing
and
a
woman
who
gayly
cried
at
him
you
really
do
understand
me
you
the
two
jogging
shadows
melted
in
the
bamboo
tracery
like
things
blown
down
the
wind
but
for
years
rudolph
had
known
the
words
the
laugh
the
beguiling
cadence
and
could
have
told
what
poise
of
the
head
went
with
them
what
dangerous
glancing
light
suddenly
without
reason
he
felt
a
gust
of
rage
it
was
he
that
understood
it
was
to
him
these
things
belonged
the
memory
of
her
weakness
was
lost
in
the
shining
memory
of
her
power
he
should
be
riding
there
in
the
dusk
of
this
lonely
and
cruel
land
heywood
had
thrown
after
them
a
single
gloomy
stare
down
the
pointed
aisle
of
bamboos
well
matched
he
growled
chantel
he
bounds
in
the
saddle
and
he
bounds
afoot
rudolph
knew
that
he
had
hated
chantel
at
sight
he
could
not
bring
himself
next
day
to
join
their
party
for
tiffin
at
the
flowery
pagoda
but
in
the
midst
of
his
brooding
teppich
and
the
fat
sturgeon
assailed
the
nunnery
gate
with
blows
and
shouts
they
had
brought
chairs
to
carry
him
off
and
being
in
no
mood
to
fail
though
panting
and
struggling
they
packed
him
into
a
palanquin
with
many
bottles
of
the
best
wine
known
to
fliegelman
and
sons
by
a
short
cut
through
the
streets
where
checkered
sunshine
through
the
lattice
roof
gave
a
muddy
subdued
light
as
in
a
roiled
aquarium
the
revelers
passed
the
inland
wall
here
in
the
shade
grooms
awaited
them
with
ponies
and
scrambling
into
saddle
they
trotted
off
through
gaps
in
the
bamboos
across
a
softly
rolling
country
tortuous
of
vivid
pink
wound
over
brilliant
green
terraces
of
young
paddy
the
pink
crescents
of
new
graves
scarred
the
hillsides
already
scalloped
and
crinkled
with
shelving
abodes
of
the
venerable
dead
great
hats
of
farmers
stooping
in
the
fields
gleamed
in
the
sun
like
shields
of
brass
over
knolls
and
through
hollows
the
little
cavalcade
jogged
steadily
till
mounting
a
gentle
eminence
they
wound
through
a
grove
of
camphor
and
above
the
branches
rose
the
faded
lilac
shaft
of
an
ancient
pagoda
ruinously
adorned
with
young
trees
and
wild
shrubs
clinging
in
the
cornices
at
the
foot
of
this
aged
fantasy
in
stone
people
were
laughing
the
three
riders
broke
cover
in
time
to
see
forrester
flushed
and
radiant
end
some
narrative
with
a
droll
pantomime
she
stood
laughing
the
life
and
centre
of
a
delighted
group
and
gilbert
forrester
she
cried
turning
archly
on
her
husband
said
that
was
funny
gilly
tugged
his
gray
moustache
in
high
chantel
nesbit
and
kempner
laughed
uproariously
the
padre
and
the
miss
drake
quietly
heywood
more
quietly
while
even
stout
uneasy
earle
smiled
as
in
duty
bound
a
squad
of
chinese
boys
busy
with
found
time
to
grin
to
this
lively
actress
in
the
white
gown
they
formed
a
sylvan
audience
under
the
gnarled
boughs
and
the
pagoda
too
late
called
the
giant
indulgently
to
the
dismounting
trio
hackh
you
should
have
come
spurring
rudolph
advanced
pale
but
with
a
calmness
of
which
afterward
he
was
justly
proud
the
heroine
of
the
moment
turned
toward
him
quickly
with
a
look
more
natural
more
sincere
than
she
had
ever
given
him
is
this
mr
hackh
she
said
graciously
i
heard
so
much
about
you
the
young
man
himself
was
almost
deceived
was
there
a
german
was
there
a
club
from
which
he
had
stolen
out
while
she
wept
ignominiously
in
that
girl
arms
and
then
of
a
sudden
he
perceived
with
a
fatuous
pleasure
how
well
she
knew
him
to
know
that
he
had
never
spoken
his
english
as
he
drew
up
a
stool
beside
miss
drake
was
wild
and
ragged
but
he
found
her
an
astonishing
refuge
for
the
first
time
he
recalled
that
this
quiet
girl
had
been
beautiful
the
other
night
and
though
now
by
day
that
beauty
was
rather
of
line
than
of
color
he
could
not
understand
how
it
had
been
overlooked
tiffin
meanwhile
sped
by
like
an
orgy
he
remembered
asking
so
many
questions
about
the
mission
hospital
and
her
school
for
orphans
that
the
girl
began
at
last
to
answer
with
constraint
and
with
puzzled
sidelong
scrutiny
he
remembered
how
even
the
tolerant
heywood
shot
a
questioning
glance
toward
his
he
remembered
telling
a
brilliant
story
and
reciting
old
captain
mau
in
vegesack
rhymes
long
forgotten
now
fluent
and
spontaneous
the
applause
was
a
triumph
through
it
as
through
a
haze
he
saw
a
pair
of
wide
blue
eyes
shining
with
startled
admiration
but
the
best
came
when
the
sun
had
lowered
behind
the
grove
the
company
grown
more
silent
and
forrester
leaning
beside
the
door
of
the
tower
turned
the
great
pegs
of
a
chinese
lute
the
notes
tinkled
like
a
mandolin
but
with
now
and
then
an
alien
wail
a
lament
unknown
to
the
west
sing
for
us
begged
the
girl
a
native
song
the
other
smiled
and
bending
forward
as
if
to
recollect
began
in
a
low
voice
somewhat
veiled
but
musical
and
full
of
meaning
the
jasmine
flower
first
then
my
love
is
gathering
dolichos
and
then
she
sang
the
long
ballad
of
the
rice
of
the
husband
and
wife
planting
side
by
side
the
springing
of
the
green
blades
the
harvest
by
millions
upon
millions
of
sheaves
the
wealth
of
the
state
more
fragrant
to
ancestors
than
offerings
of
spice
o
labor
and
love
and
hallowed
land
think
you
these
things
are
but
still
to
come
think
you
they
are
but
near
at
hand
only
now
and
here
behold
they
were
the
same
in
years
of
old
in
her
plaintive
interlude
the
servants
watched
her
nodding
and
muttering
under
the
camphor
trees
and
here
a
song
of
exile
she
said
i
render
it
very
badly
rudolph
had
never
seen
her
face
like
this
bending
intently
above
the
lute
it
was
as
though
in
the
music
she
found
and
disclosed
herself
without
guile
blue
was
the
sky
and
blue
the
water
lay
holding
the
sky
blue
was
the
robe
she
wore
that
day
alas
my
sorrow
why
must
life
bear
all
away
away
away
ah
my
beloved
why
a
murmur
of
praise
went
round
the
group
as
she
put
aside
the
instrument
the
sun
getting
low
she
said
lightly
and
i
see
that
view
from
the
top
chantel
was
rising
but
sat
down
again
with
a
scowl
as
she
turned
to
rudolph
you
never
seen
it
hackh
do
come
help
me
up
inside
with
echoing
steps
they
mounted
in
a
squalid
well
obscurely
lighted
from
the
upper
windows
toward
which
decaying
stairs
rose
in
a
dangerous
spiral
without
a
misstep
being
no
trifle
rudolph
offered
his
hand
for
the
mere
safety
but
she
took
it
with
a
curious
little
laugh
they
climbed
cautiously
once
at
a
halt
she
stood
very
close
with
eyes
shining
large
in
the
dusk
her
slight
body
trembled
her
head
shook
with
stifled
merriment
like
a
girl
overcome
by
mischief
what
a
queer
little
world
she
whispered
you
and
i
here
i
never
dreamed
you
could
be
funny
it
made
me
so
proud
of
you
down
there
he
muttered
something
vague
and
the
stairs
ending
in
ruin
at
the
fourth
story
handed
her
carefully
through
the
window
to
a
small
outer
balustrade
as
they
stood
together
at
the
rail
he
knew
not
whether
to
be
angry
suspicious
or
glad
i
love
this
prospect
she
began
quietly
that
why
i
wanted
you
to
come
beyond
the
camphors
a
wide
strange
landscape
glowed
in
the
full
light
the
ocean
lay
a
sapphire
band
in
the
east
in
the
west
on
a
long
ridge
undulated
the
gray
battlements
of
a
city
the
antique
walls
warmed
and
glorified
breasting
the
flood
of
sunset
all
between
lay
vernal
fields
and
hillocks
maidenhair
sprays
of
bamboo
and
a
wandering
pattern
of
pink
slowly
along
one
of
these
a
merchant
rode
a
white
pony
his
bells
tinkling
in
the
stillness
of
sea
and
land
everywhere
like
other
bells
more
tiny
and
shrill
sounded
the
trilling
of
frogs
as
the
two
on
the
pagoda
stood
listening
it
was
before
rome
she
declared
thoughtfully
before
egypt
and
has
never
changed
you
and
i
are
just
she
broke
off
humming
only
here
and
now
behold
they
were
the
same
in
years
of
old
her
mood
colored
the
scene
the
aged
continuity
of
life
oppressed
him
yet
he
chose
rather
to
watch
the
straggling
battlements
far
off
than
to
meet
her
eyes
or
see
her
hair
gleaming
in
the
sun
through
many
troubled
days
he
had
forgotten
her
despised
her
bound
his
heart
in
triple
brass
against
a
future
in
her
hateful
neighborhood
and
now
beside
her
at
this
rail
he
was
in
danger
of
being
happy
it
was
inglorious
he
tried
to
frown
you
poor
boy
suddenly
with
an
impulse
that
must
have
been
generous
she
rested
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
was
sorry
i
thought
of
you
so
often
at
these
close
quarters
her
tremulous
voice
and
searching
upward
glance
meant
that
she
alone
understood
all
his
troubles
he
started
turned
for
some
rush
of
overwhelming
speech
when
a
head
popped
through
the
window
behind
them
boot
and
saddle
forrester
announced
heywood
his
lean
young
face
was
very
droll
and
knowing
we
leaving
thank
you
so
much
maurice
she
answered
perhaps
dryly
you
a
dear
to
climb
all
those
dreadful
stairs
oh
said
heywood
with
his
gray
eyes
fastened
on
rudolph
no
trouble
all
three
went
down
the
dark
well
together
when
the
company
were
mounted
and
trooping
downhill
through
the
camphor
shadow
heywood
pony
came
sidling
against
rudolph
till
legging
chafed
legging
you
blossomed
old
boy
he
whispered
quite
the
star
after
your
comedy
turn
he
reined
aside
grinning
what
price
sympathy
on
a
pagoda
for
that
moment
rudolph
could
have
struck
down
the
one
sure
friend
he
had
in
china

iphigenia
do
chop
off
a
hen
head
with
a
heywood
still
with
a
malicious
friendly
quirk
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
held
in
his
fretful
pony
rudolph
stood
bending
a
whip
viciously
they
two
had
fetched
a
compass
about
the
town
and
now
in
the
twilight
were
parting
before
the
nunnery
gate
a
tiff
the
last
thing
i
want
with
you
the
lady
in
confidence
is
not
worth
i
do
not
wish
declared
rudolph
trembling
i
do
not
wish
you
to
say
those
things
so
right
laughed
the
other
and
his
pony
wheeled
at
the
word
i
give
you
one
month
no
you
such
a
good
thorough
little
chap
it
will
take
longer
two
months
to
change
your
mind
only
he
looked
down
at
rudolph
with
a
comic
elderly
air
let
me
observe
our
yellow
people
have
that
rather
neat
proverb
a
hen
head
dear
chap
not
with
a
no
hot
weather
coming
too
no
sorrows
of
werther
now
over
such
he
laughed
again
do
scowl
i
be
good
i
wo
say
it
you
supply
the
word
in
two
months
he
let
the
pony
have
his
way
and
was
off
in
a
clatter
lonely
fuming
with
resentment
rudolph
stared
after
him
what
could
he
know
this
airy
unfeeling
meddler
so
free
with
his
advice
and
innuendo
let
him
go
then
let
him
canter
away
he
had
seen
quickly
guessed
with
a
diabolic
shrewdness
yet
would
remain
on
the
surface
always
of
a
mystery
so
violent
and
so
profound
the
young
man
stalked
into
his
vacant
nunnery
in
a
rage
a
dismal
pomp
of
emotion
reason
telling
him
that
a
friend
had
spoken
sense
imagination
clothing
him
in
the
sceptred
pall
of
tragedy
yet
one
of
these
unwelcome
words
had
stuck
he
was
werther
it
was
true
a
man
who
came
too
late
another
word
was
soon
fulfilled
for
the
hot
weather
came
sudden
tropical
ferocious
without
gradation
the
vernal
days
and
languid
noons
were
gone
in
a
twinkling
the
change
came
like
another
act
of
a
play
one
morning
though
the
dawn
stirred
cool
and
fragrant
as
all
dawns
before
the
boy
laid
out
rudolph
white
tunic
slipped
in
the
shining
buttons
smeared
on
his
heaviest
helmet
and
rudolph
looking
from
his
window
saw
that
on
the
river
by
the
same
instinct
boatmen
were
stretching
up
their
bamboo
awnings
breakfast
was
hardly
ended
before
river
and
convex
field
and
huddling
red
tiles
of
the
town
lay
under
a
blurred
quivering
distortion
the
day
flamed
at
night
against
a
glow
of
fiery
umber
the
western
hills
broke
sharp
and
thin
as
while
below
them
rose
in
flooding
mirage
a
bright
strip
of
magical
water
thus
in
these
days
he
rode
for
his
exercise
while
the
sun
still
lay
behind
the
ocean
and
thus
her
lively
pointed
face
and
wide
blue
eyes
wondering
or
downcast
or
merry
were
mingled
in
his
thoughts
with
the
first
rousing
of
the
world
the
beat
of
hoofs
in
cool
silences
the
wide
lights
of
creation
over
an
aged
weary
alien
empire
their
ponies
whinnying
like
old
friends
they
met
by
chance
or
appointment
before
the
power
of
sleep
had
lifted
from
eyes
still
new
and
strange
against
the
morning
sometimes
chantel
the
handsome
rode
glowering
beside
them
sometimes
gilly
erect
and
solid
in
the
saddle
laid
upon
their
talk
all
the
weight
of
his
honest
tired
commonplaces
but
one
morning
she
cantered
up
alone
laughing
at
her
escape
his
pony
bolted
and
they
raced
along
together
as
comrades
happily
join
forces
in
a
headlong
dream
quivering
bamboo
swept
behind
them
the
river
on
their
other
hand
met
and
passed
in
hurrying
panorama
they
had
no
time
for
words
but
only
laughter
words
indeed
had
never
yet
advanced
them
beyond
that
moment
on
the
pagoda
and
now
when
their
ponies
fell
into
a
shambling
trot
came
the
first
impulse
of
speech
how
lucky
she
cried
how
lucky
we
came
this
way
now
i
can
really
test
you
he
turned
her
glowing
face
was
now
averted
her
gesture
was
not
for
him
but
for
the
scene
he
studied
that
to
understand
her
the
river
up
which
they
had
fled
now
rested
broad
and
quiet
as
a
shallow
lake
burnished
faintly
brooded
over
by
a
floating
increasing
light
not
yet
compounded
into
day
tussocks
innumerable
clods
and
crumbs
of
vivid
green
speckled
all
the
nearer
water
on
some
of
these
storks
meditated
sage
pondering
heads
and
urbane
bodies
perched
high
on
the
frailest
penciling
of
legs
in
the
whole
expanse
no
movement
came
but
when
a
distant
bird
leaving
his
philosophic
pose
plunged
downward
after
a
fish
beyond
them
rose
a
shapeless
mound
or
isle
like
some
monster
grounded
in
his
native
ooze
there
said
the
woman
pointing
are
you
all
excuses
like
the
others
or
do
you
dare
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
now
retorted
rudolph
and
with
truth
after
the
dash
of
their
twilight
encounter
dare
what
go
see
what
on
that
island
she
answered
i
dared
them
all
twice
i
seen
natives
land
there
and
hurry
away
nesbit
was
too
lazy
to
try
chantel
wearing
his
best
clothes
maurice
heywood
refused
to
mire
his
horse
for
a
whim
whim
it
a
mystery
come
now
do
you
dare
in
a
rare
flush
of
pride
rudolph
wheeled
his
stubborn
mount
and
bullied
him
down
the
bank
a
poor
horseman
he
would
have
outstripped
curtius
to
the
gulf
but
no
sooner
had
his
dancing
pony
consented
to
make
the
first
rebellious
sidelong
plunge
than
he
had
small
joy
of
his
boast
sank
floundering
were
hoisted
with
a
terrified
wrench
of
the
shoulders
in
the
same
moment
that
went
down
as
by
suction
the
pony
squirmed
heaved
wrestled
in
a
frenzy
and
churning
the
red
water
about
his
master
thighs
went
deeper
and
fared
worse
with
a
clangor
of
wings
the
storks
rose
a
streaming
rout
against
the
sky
trailed
their
tilted
legs
filed
away
in
straggling
flight
like
figures
interlacing
on
a
panel
at
the
height
of
his
distress
rudolph
caught
a
whirling
glimpse
of
the
woman
above
him
safe
on
firm
earth
easy
in
her
saddle
and
laughing
quicksand
then
was
a
joke
but
he
could
not
pause
for
this
added
bewilderment
the
pony
using
a
skill
born
of
agony
had
found
somewhere
a
solid
verge
and
scrambled
up
well
out
from
the
bank
with
a
splash
rudolph
stood
beside
him
among
the
tufts
of
salad
green
as
he
patted
the
trembling
flanks
he
heard
a
cry
from
the
shore
oh
well
done
she
mocked
them
well
done
a
gust
of
wholesome
anger
refreshed
him
she
might
laugh
but
now
he
would
see
this
folly
through
he
tore
off
his
coat
flung
it
across
the
saddle
waded
out
alone
through
the
tussocks
and
shooting
forward
full
length
in
the
turbid
water
swam
resolutely
for
the
island
sky
and
water
brightened
while
he
swam
and
as
he
rose
wrapped
in
the
leaden
weight
of
dripping
clothes
the
sun
before
and
above
him
touched
wonderfully
the
quaggy
bank
and
parched
grasses
he
lurched
ashore
his
feet
caked
with
enormous
clods
as
of
melting
chocolate
a
filthy
scramble
left
him
smeared
and
disheveled
on
the
summit
he
had
come
for
nothing
the
mound
lay
vacant
a
tangled
patch
a
fragment
of
wilderness
yet
as
he
stood
panting
there
rose
a
puny
miserable
sound
what
presence
could
lurk
there
the
distress
it
might
be
of
some
small
animal
a
rabbit
dying
in
a
forgotten
trap
faint
as
illusion
a
wail
a
thread
of
sorrow
broke
into
lonely
whimpering
and
ceased
he
moved
forward
doubtfully
and
of
a
sudden
in
the
scrubby
level
of
the
isle
stumbled
on
the
rim
of
a
shallow
circular
depression
at
first
he
could
not
believe
the
discovery
but
next
instant
as
at
the
temple
pond
though
now
without
need
of
placard
or
interpreter
he
understood
this
bowl
a
tiny
crater
among
the
weeds
showed
like
some
paltry
valley
of
ezekiel
a
charnel
place
of
herod
innocents
the
battlefield
of
some
babes
crusade
a
chill
struck
him
not
from
the
water
or
the
early
mists
in
stupor
he
viewed
that
savage
fact
through
the
stillness
of
death
sounded
again
the
note
of
living
discontent
he
was
aware
also
of
some
stir
even
before
he
spied
under
a
withered
clump
the
saffron
body
of
an
infant
girl
feebly
squirming
by
a
loathsome
irony
there
lay
beside
her
an
earthen
bowl
of
rice
as
an
earnest
or
symbol
of
regret
blind
pity
urged
him
into
the
atrocious
hollow
seeing
no
further
than
the
present
rescue
he
caught
up
the
small
unclean
sufferer
who
moaned
the
louder
as
he
carried
her
down
the
bank
and
waded
out
through
the
sludge
to
hold
the
squalling
mouth
above
water
and
swim
was
no
simple
feat
yet
at
last
he
came
floundering
among
the
tussocks
wrapped
the
naked
body
in
his
jacket
and
with
infinite
pains
tugged
his
terrified
pony
along
a
tortuous
bar
to
the
land
once
in
the
he
stood
gloomily
and
let
forrester
canter
up
to
join
him
indeed
he
had
almost
forgotten
her
splendid
she
laughed
what
a
figure
of
fun
but
what
can
you
have
brought
back
oh
please
i
ca
wait
he
turned
on
her
a
muddy
haggard
face
without
enthusiasm
and
gently
unfolded
the
coat
the
man
and
the
woman
looked
down
together
in
silence
at
the
child
he
had
some
foolish
hope
that
she
would
take
it
that
his
part
was
ended
like
an
outlandish
doll
with
face
contorted
and
eyes
shut
tightly
against
the
sunshine
the
outcast
whimpered
too
near
the
point
of
death
for
even
the
rebellion
of
arms
and
legs
the
woman
in
the
saddle
gave
a
short
incredulous
cry
her
face
all
gay
curiosity
had
darkened
in
a
shock
of
disgust
what
in
the
world
she
scolded
oh
such
a
nasty
little
why
did
what
do
you
propose
doing
with
it
rudolph
shook
his
head
like
a
man
caught
in
some
stupid
blunder
i
never
thought
of
that
he
explained
heavily
she
has
no
no
friends
cover
it
his
companion
ordered
cover
it
up
i
ca
bear
to
see
it
with
a
sombre
disappointed
air
he
obeyed
then
looked
up
as
if
in
her
face
he
read
strange
matter
i
ca
bear
she
added
quickly
to
see
any
kind
of
suffering
why
did
it
all
my
fault
for
sending
you
we
were
having
such
a
good
ride
together
and
now
i
spoiled
it
all
with
poor
little
filthy
object
she
turned
her
hands
outward
with
a
helpless
dainty
gesture
but
what
can
we
do
these
things
happen
every
day
rudolph
was
studying
the
ground
again
his
thoughts
then
had
wronged
her
drenched
and
downhearted
holding
this
strange
burden
in
his
jacket
he
felt
that
he
had
foolishly
meddled
in
things
inevitable
beyond
repair
she
was
right
yet
some
vague
insurgent
instinct
which
would
not
down
told
him
that
there
had
been
a
disappointment
still
what
had
he
expected
no
woman
could
help
no
woman
then
suddenly
he
mounted
bundle
and
all
and
turned
his
willing
pony
homeward
come
he
said
and
for
the
first
time
unwittingly
had
taken
charge
what
is
it
she
called
you
foolish
boy
what
your
plan
we
shall
see
he
answered
without
waiting
he
beckoned
her
to
follow
she
came
they
rode
stirrup
to
stirrup
silent
as
in
their
escape
at
dawn
and
as
close
bodily
but
in
spirit
traveling
distant
parallels
he
gave
no
thought
to
that
riding
toward
his
experiment
near
the
town
at
last
he
reined
aside
to
a
cluster
of
buildings
white
walls
and
rosy
tiles
under
a
great
willow
you
may
save
your
steps
she
declared
with
sudden
petulance
the
hospital
more
out
of
funds
than
ever
and
more
crowded
they
not
thank
you
rudolph
nodded
back
at
her
with
a
queer
smile
half
reckless
and
half
confident
then
he
replied
dismounting
i
will
replenish
my
nunnery
squatting
coolies
sprang
up
and
raced
to
hold
his
pony
others
in
the
shade
of
the
wall
cackled
when
they
saw
a
son
of
the
so
beplastered
and
sopping
a
few
pointed
at
his
bundle
with
grunts
of
sudden
interest
and
a
leper
bearing
the
visage
as
of
a
stone
lion
defaced
by
time
cried
something
harshly
at
his
words
the
whole
band
of
idlers
began
to
chatter
rudolph
turned
to
aid
his
companion
she
sat
watching
them
sharply
an
uneasy
light
troubled
the
innocent
blue
eyes
which
had
not
even
a
glance
for
him
no
i
sha
get
down
she
said
angrily
it
just
what
might
be
your
little
brat
will
bring
no
good
to
any
of
us
he
flung
away
defiantly
strode
through
the
gate
and
calling
aloud
traversed
an
empty
compound
already
heated
by
the
sun
a
cooler
fringe
of
veranda
or
shallow
cloister
lined
a
second
court
two
figures
met
him
the
miss
drake
all
in
white
and
behind
her
a
shuffling
grinning
native
woman
who
carried
a
basin
in
which
permanganate
of
potash
swam
gleaming
like
diluted
blood
with
one
droll
look
of
amusement
the
girl
had
understood
and
regained
that
grave
yet
happy
friendly
composure
which
had
the
virtue
he
discovered
of
being
easily
forgotten
to
be
met
each
time
like
something
new
what
have
you
there
for
us
again
he
unfolded
the
jacket
a
child
the
naked
mite
lay
very
still
the
breath
weakly
fluttered
a
somewhat
nauseous
gift
the
girl
raised
her
arms
and
received
it
gently
without
haste
the
saffron
body
appearing
yet
more
squalid
against
the
palladian
whiteness
of
her
tunic
plain
and
cool
as
drapery
in
marble
it
may
live
she
said
we
do
what
we
can
and
followed
by
the
woman
she
moved
quickly
away
to
offer
battle
with
death
a
plain
usual
fact
it
seemed
involving
no
more
surprise
than
repugnance
her
face
had
hardly
altered
and
yet
rudolph
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
had
caught
the
fleeting
brightness
of
compassion
mere
light
of
the
eyes
a
glory
incongruous
in
the
sharp
smell
of
antiseptics
it
left
him
wondering
in
the
cloister
he
knew
now
what
had
been
missing
by
the
river
i
was
naked
and
how
ran
the
lines
he
turned
to
go
recalling
in
a
whirl
snatches
of
truth
he
had
never
known
since
boyhood
never
seen
away
from
home
across
a
court
the
padre
hailed
him
a
tall
ungainly
patriarch
under
an
enormous
mushroom
helmet
of
solar
pith
and
walking
along
beside
listened
shrewdly
to
his
narrative
they
paused
at
the
outer
gate
the
padre
nodding
frowning
slightly
stood
at
ease
all
angles
and
loose
joints
as
if
relaxed
by
the
growing
heat
suddenly
he
stood
erect
as
a
grenadier
that
lie
again
he
cried
listen
the
leper
without
harangued
from
his
place
apart
in
a
raucous
voice
filled
with
the
solitary
pride
of
intellect
well
men
shall
revile
you
growled
earle
he
says
we
steal
children
to
puncture
their
eyes
for
magic
medicine
then
heaving
his
wide
shoulders
oh
well
he
said
wearily
thanks
anyhow
come
see
us
when
not
so
busy
good
look
out
these
fellows
do
fly
at
you
tired
and
befouled
rudolph
passed
through
into
the
torrid
glare
the
leper
cut
short
his
snarling
oration
but
without
looking
at
him
the
young
man
took
the
bridle
from
the
coolie
there
had
been
a
test
he
had
seen
a
child
and
two
women
and
yet
it
was
with
a
pang
he
found
that
forrester
had
not
waited
chapter
viii
the
hot
night
rudolph
paced
his
long
chamber
like
a
wolf
a
wolf
in
summer
with
too
thick
a
coat
in
sweat
of
body
and
heat
of
mind
he
crossed
from
window
to
window
unable
to
halt
a
faintly
sour
smell
of
parched
things
oppressing
the
night
without
breath
or
motion
was
like
an
interminable
presence
irritating
poisonous
the
punkah
too
flapped
incessant
and
only
made
the
lamp
gutter
broad
leaves
outside
shone
in
mockery
of
snow
and
like
snow
the
stifled
river
lay
in
the
moonlight
where
the
wet
muzzles
of
buffaloes
glistened
floating
like
knots
on
sunken
logs
or
the
snouts
of
crocodiles
birds
fluttered
sleepless
and
wretched
coolies
flung
asleep
on
the
burnt
grass
might
have
been
corpses
but
for
the
sound
of
their
troubled
breathing
if
i
could
believe
he
groaned
sitting
with
hands
thrust
through
his
hair
if
i
believe
in
her
but
i
came
too
late
the
lamp
was
an
added
torment
he
sprang
up
from
it
wiped
the
drops
off
his
forehead
and
paced
again
he
came
too
late
all
alone
the
collar
of
his
tunic
strangled
him
he
stuffed
his
fingers
underneath
and
wrenched
then
as
he
came
and
went
catching
sight
in
a
mirror
was
shocked
to
see
that
in
biblical
fashion
he
had
rent
his
garments
this
is
bad
he
thought
staring
it
is
the
heat
i
must
not
stay
alone
he
shouted
clapped
his
hands
for
a
servant
and
at
last
snatching
a
coat
from
his
unruffled
boy
hurried
away
through
stillness
and
moonlight
to
the
detested
club
on
the
stairs
a
song
greeted
him
a
fragment
with
more
breath
than
melody
in
a
raw
bass
jolly
boating
weather
and
a
hay
harvest
breeze
shut
up
snarled
another
voice
good
god
man
the
loft
was
like
a
cave
heated
by
subterranean
fires
two
long
punkahs
flapped
languidly
in
the
darkness
with
a
whine
of
pulleys
under
a
swinging
lamp
in
a
pool
of
light
and
heat
four
men
sat
playing
cards
their
tousled
heads
bare
arms
and
cinglets
torn
open
across
the
chest
giving
them
the
air
of
desperadoes
jolly
boating
weather
wheezed
the
fat
sturgeon
he
stood
apart
in
shadow
swaying
on
his
feet
what
would
you
give
he
propounded
thickly
for
a
hay
harvest
breeze
he
climbed
or
rolled
upon
the
turned
head
toward
punkah
and
suddenly
lay
still
a
gross
white
figure
collapsed
and
sprawling
how
much
does
he
think
a
man
can
stand
snapped
nesbit
his
lean
cockney
face
pulled
in
savage
lines
beast
of
a
song
he
die
drinking
die
yourself
mumbled
the
singer
goin
sleep
more
you
can
do
a
groan
from
the
players
and
the
vicious
flip
of
a
card
acknowledged
the
hit
rudolph
joined
them
ungreeting
and
ungreeted
the
game
went
on
grimly
with
now
and
then
the
tinkle
of
ice
or
the
popping
of
soda
bottles
sharp
cords
and
flaccid
folds
in
wutzler
neck
brown
cheeks
the
point
of
heywood
resolute
chin
shone
wet
and
polished
in
the
lamplight
all
four
men
scowled
pugnaciously
even
the
pale
nesbit
who
was
winning
bad
temper
filled
the
air
as
palpable
as
the
heat
and
stink
of
the
burning
oil
only
heywood
maintained
a
febrile
gayety
interrupting
the
game
perversely
stirring
old
wutzler
to
incoherent
speech
what
that
about
rome
he
asked
you
were
saying
rome
is
safed
cried
the
outcast
with
sudden
enthusiasm
in
your
paper
i
read
how

chantel
rapped
out
a
parisian
oath
do
we
play
cards
he
cried
sourly
or
listen
to
the
chatter
of
senility
heywood
held
to
the
previous
question
no
wutz
that
town
no
longer
fortified
he
answered
slowly
geese
live
there
still
as
in
many
other
places
chantel
examined
his
as
though
for
some
defect
then
snatching
up
the
cards
shuffled
and
dealt
with
intense
precision
the
game
went
on
as
before
i
read
alzo
stammered
wutzler
like
a
timid
scholar
encouraged
to
lecture
i
read

how

he
mopped
his
lean
throat
with
the
back
of
his
hand
in
bengal
are
dere
rallis
dey

jute
yes
heywood
smiled
a
weary
indulgence
next
instant
he
whirled
on
rudolph
in
is
this
a
game
or
idiot
joy
i
playing
my
best
explained
rudolph
sulkily
then
your
best
is
the
worst
i
ever
saw
better
learn
before
sitting
in
chantel
laughed
without
merriment
rudolph
flung
down
his
cards
stalked
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
in
lonely
impotent
rage
a
long
time
passed
marked
by
alarming
snores
from
the
the
watchers
played
on
in
ferocious
silence
the
night
wore
along
without
relief
hours
might
have
lapsed
when
chantel
broke
out
as
though
the
talk
had
but
paused
a
moment
so
it
goes
he
sneered
fools
will
always
sit
in
when
they
do
not
know
they
rush
into
the
water
also
and
play
the
hero
again
his
laughter
was
brief
but
malignant
heywood
had
left
his
cards
risen
and
crossing
the
room
stood
looking
over
rudolph
shoulder
into
the
snowy
moonlight
on
the
shoulder
his
hand
rested
as
by
accident
it
the
heat
old
chap
he
said
wearily
do
mind
what
we
say
rudolph
made
no
sign
except
to
move
from
under
his
hand
so
that
with
their
quarrel
between
them
the
two
men
stared
out
across
the
blanched
roofs
and
drooping
trees
where
long
black
shadows
at
last
crept
toward
the
dawn
these
heroes
continued
the
mocker
what
is
danger
pouf
nothing
they
make
it
for
the
rest
of
us
so
easily
do
you
know
his
voice
rose
and
quickened
do
you
know
the
other
end
of
town
is
in
an
uproar
we
murder
children
it
appears
for
medicine
rudolph
started
turned
but
now
sat
quiet
under
heywood
grasp
chantel
in
the
lamplight
watched
the
punkahs
with
a
hateful
smile
the
gascons
are
not
all
dead
he
murmured
they
plunge
us
all
into
a
turmoil
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
he
made
a
sudden
startling
gesture
like
a
man
who
has
lost
control
for
the
sake
he
cried
angrily
of
a
person
we
all
know
oh
we
all
know
her
she
is
nothing
more
there
was
a
light
scuffle
at
the
window
chantel
began
heywood
with
a
sharp
and
dangerous
courtesy
we
are
all
unlike
ourselves
i
am
hardly
the
person
to
remind
you
but
this
club
is
hardly
the
place
oh
la
la
the
other
snapped
his
fingers
and
reverting
to
his
native
tongue
finished
his
sentence
wildly
you
cad
heywood
advanced
in
long
strides
deliberately
as
if
gathering
momentum
for
a
collision
before
his
blow
could
fall
he
was
sent
spinning
rudolph
his
cheeks
on
fire
darted
past
and
dealt
full
force
a
clumsy
backhand
sweep
of
the
arm
light
and
quick
as
a
leopard
chantel
was
on
foot
erect
and
even
while
his
chair
crashed
on
the
floor
had
whipped
out
a
handkerchief
you
are
right
heywood
he
said
stanching
his
lips
in
icy
composure
his
eyes
held
an
odd
gleam
of
satisfaction
you
are
right
we
are
not
like
ourselves
at
present
i
will
better
ask
sturgeon
to
see
your
friend
morning
this
morning
rather
not
without
dignity
he
turned
stepped
quickly
to
the
stairs
saluted
gravely
and
went
down
no
no
panted
nesbit
wrestling
with
rudolph
easy
on
now
let
you
go
no
fear
heywood
wrenched
the
captive
loose
but
only
to
shake
him
violently
and
thrust
him
into
a
chair
be
quiet
you
little
ass
he
scolded
i
a
great
mind
myself
to
run
after
the
bounder
and
kick
him
but
that
sort
of
thing
you
did
enough
who
have
thought
you
young
spitfire
chantel
took
you
on
exactly
as
he
wanted
the
fat
sleeper
continued
to
snore
wutzler
came
slinking
back
from
his
refuge
in
the
shadows
it
iss
zo
badt
he
whined
gulping
nervously
it
iss
zo
badt
right
you
are
said
heywood
with
arms
folded
he
eyed
them
sternly
it
bad
we
might
have
known
if
only
i
reached
him
first
by
jove
you
must
let
me
fight
that
beast
duels
the
idiot
nobody
fights
duels
any
more
i
always
his
cuffs
are
always
dirty
too
on
the
inside
rudolph
leaned
back
like
a
man
refreshed
and
comforted
but
his
laugh
was
unsteady
and
too
boisterous
it
is
well
he
bragged
they
fly
on
the
wings
of
chance
no
all
is
well
pistols
my
dear
young
gentleman
scoffed
his
friend
there
not
a
pair
of
matched
pistols
in
the
settlement
and
if
there
were
chantel
has
the
choice
he
take
swords
he
paused
in
a
silence
that
grew
somewhat
menacing
from
a
slit
in
the
wall
the
wheel
of
the
whined
insistently
rise
and
fall
rise
and
fall
of
peevish
complaint
distressing
as
a
bird
swords
of
course
continued
heywood
if
only
out
of
vanity
fencing
oh
i
hate
the
man
and
the
art
if
you
like
but
he
a
beautiful
swordsman
wonderful
rudolph
still
lay
back
but
now
with
a
singular
calm
it
just
as
well
he
declared
quietly
heywood
loosed
a
great
breath
a
sigh
of
vast
relief
my
word
he
cried
grinning
so
you
there
too
eh
you
young
if
you
another
expert
bravo
we
beat
him
at
his
own
game
hoist
with
his
own
i
give
anything
he
thumped
the
table
and
pitched
the
cards
broadcast
like
an
explosion
of
confetti
in
a
little
carnival
of
glee
you
old
but
are
you
sure
he
quick
as
lightning
i
am
not
afraid
replied
rudolph
modestly
he
trained
his
young
moustache
upward
with
steady
fingers
and
sat
very
quiet
thinking
long
thoughts
a
quaint
smile
played
about
his
eyes
good
for
you
said
heywood
now
let
him
come
as
the
lord
mayor
said
of
the
hare
what
sport
with
an
even
chance
and
what
a
load
off
one
mind
he
moved
away
to
the
window
as
though
searching
for
air
instead
of
moonlight
without
there
swam
the
blue
mist
of
dawn
not
a
word
must
ever
reach
old
gilly
he
mused
do
you
hear
nesbit
if
you
think
retorted
the
clerk
stiffly
i
do
know
the
proper
course
of
not
likely
the
tall
silhouette
in
the
window
made
no
reply
but
stood
grumbling
privately
a
club
yes
where
we
drink
out
of
dead
cushions
dead
balls
no
veranda
fellow
that
soils
the
inside
of
his
cuffs
first
we
a
pack
of
he
propped
his
elbows
on
the
long
sill
and
leaned
out
venting
fragments
of
disgust
then
of
a
sudden
he
turned
and
beckoned
eagerly
come
here
you
chaps
the
others
joined
him
gray
vapors
from
river
and
lingering
like
steam
in
a
slow
breeze
paled
and
dispersed
in
the
growing
light
as
the
new
day
worse
than
the
old
came
sullenly
without
breath
or
respite
a
few
twilight
shapes
were
pattering
through
the
narrow
street
a
squad
of
yamên
runners
haling
a
prisoner
the
remains
active
said
heywood
thoughtfully
that
dingy
little
procession
do
you
know
it
quite
theatrical
the
cross
and
the
dragon
eh
another
act
coming
even
rudolph
could
spare
a
misgiving
from
his
own
difficulty
while
he
watched
the
prisoner
it
was
chok
chung
the
plump
christian
merchant
slowly
trudging
toward
the
darkest
of
human
courts
to
answer
for
the
death
of
the
the
squad
passed
by
rudolph
saw
again
the
lighted
shop
the
tumbled
figure
retching
on
the
floor
and
with
these
came
a
memory
of
that
cold
and
scornful
face
thinking
so
cruelly
among
the
unthinking
rabble
the
had
written
something
in
the
dark
i
go
find
out
and
wutzler
was
away
as
keen
as
a
village
gossip
trouble
comin
nesbit
asserted
glibly
there
politics
afloat
but
i
do
care
he
stretched
his
arms
with
a
weary
howl
that
the
first
yawn
i
done
trouble
keeps
worse
luck
i
off
seek
my
downy
alone
with
the
grunting
sleeper
the
two
friends
sat
for
a
long
time
and
watched
the
flooding
daylight
what
began
rudolph
suddenly
and
his
voice
trembled
what
is
your
true
opinion
you
are
so
kind
and
i
was
just
a
fool
that
other
day
i
would
not
listen
you
laughed
now
tell
me
so
as
you
were
to
die
next
you
were
joking
can
i
truly
be
proud
of
of
her
he
leaned
forward
white
and
eager
waiting
for
the
truth
like
a
dicer
for
the
final
throw
of
yourself
dear
old
chap
not
of
the
lady
she
the
fool
not
you
poor
old
gilly
forrester
slaves
here
to
send
her
junketing
in
japan
kashmir
ceylon
home
what
chantel
said
well
between
the
two
of
us
i
afraid
he
right
it
a
pity
heywood
paused
frowning
a
pity
too
this
quarrel
so
precious
few
of
us
and
trouble
ahead
the
natives
lashing
themselves
into
a
state
of
mind
or
being
lashed
the
least
spark
rough
work
ahead
and
here
we
are
at
swords
points
and
the
joke
is
rudolph
added
quietly
i
do
not
know
a
sword
point
from
a
handle
heywood
turned
glowered
and
twice
failed
to
speak
rudie
old
boy
he
stammered
that
man
preposterous
why
it
plain
murder
rudolph
stared
straight
ahead
without
hope
without
illusions
facing
the
haggard
light
of
morning
a
few
weeks
ago
he
might
have
wept
but
now
his
laugh
short
and
humorous
was
worthy
of
his
companion
i
do
not
care
more
he
answered
luck
so
called
i
it
when
i
escaped
the
militar
service
ho
ho
luck
to
pass
into
the
i
do
not
care
now
i
can
not
believe
even
can
not

deserts

chapter
ix
passage
at
arms
boy
sai
forrester
come
you
talkee
he
master
no
got
you
he
can
do
the
boy
scuffed
away
across
the
chunam
floor
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
heywood
submitted
his
head
once
more
to
the
nimble
hands
of
his
groom
who
with
and
a
pair
of
enormous
iron
shears
was
trimming
the
stubborn
chestnut
locks
still
closer
the
afternoon
glow
reflected
from
the
burnt
grass
and
white
walls
of
the
compound
struck
upward
in
the
of
the
ground
floor
and
lighted
oddly
the
yellow
mafoo
and
his
serious
young
master
nesbit
pert
as
a
jockey
sat
on
the
table
swinging
his
feet
furiously
sturgeon
would
take
it
all
right
of
course
he
said
with
airy
wisdom
quite
the
gentleman
he
is
no
fault
of
his
not
the
least
heywood
assented
gloomily
did
everything
he
could
if
i
were
commissioned
to
tell
outright
youngster
fence
why
we
might
save
the
day
but
our
man
wo
even
listen
to
that
fight
the
word
chantel
will
see
on
the
spot
directly
they
face
but
will
that
stop
him
no
fear
he
worked
up
to
the
pitch
of
killing
he
lunge
first
and
be
surprised
so
regrettable
such
remorse
oh
i
know
the
cockney
fidgeted
for
a
time
his
face
the
face
of
a
urchin
slowly
worked
into
lines
of
abnormal
cunning
i
say
i
was
thinking
he
ventured
at
last
two
swords
that
all
just
so
now
my
boy
used
to
be
at
chantel
knows
that
inside
out
loafs
there
now
the
beggar
with
chantel
cook
why
not
send
him
over
prowling
ye
know
fingers
the
ass
and
breaks
a
perfectly
secure
all
plopah
accident
ye
know
all
off
with
their
little
duel
what
heywood
chuckled
and
bowed
his
head
to
the
last
week
he
replied
not
this
afternoon
rather
late
for
accidents
you
make
me
feel
like
pompey
on
his
galley
thou
shouldst
have
done
and
not
have
spoken
o
besides
those
swords
belonged
to
chantel
father
he
began
as
a
but
you
a
good
sort
nesbit
to
take
the
affair
this
fashion
lost
in
smoke
the
clerk
grumbled
that
the
gory
affair
was
unmentionable
nonsense
quite
said
heywood
we
tried
reasoning
no
go
as
you
say
an
accident
that
all
can
save
the
youngster
now
impossible
of
course
he
sighed
then
suddenly
the
gray
eyes
lighted
became
both
shrewd
and
distant
a
malicious
little
smile
stole
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
the
credit
yours
nesbit
accident
can
do
and
this
one
by
jove
it
wo
leave
either
of
a
leg
to
stand
on
here
mafoo
makee
finish
he
sprang
up
clapped
a
helmet
on
the
shorn
head
and
stalked
out
into
the
sunlight
come
on
he
called
it
nearly
time
we
must
pick
up
our
young
hotspur
the
clerk
followed
through
the
glowing
compound
and
the
road
in
the
shade
of
the
nunnery
gate
they
found
rudolph
who
raising
his
rattan
saluted
them
with
a
pale
and
stoic
gravity
are
we
ready
he
asked
and
turning
took
a
slow
cool
survey
of
the
nunnery
as
though
looking
his
last
from
the
ditch
at
their
feet
to
the
red
tiles
patched
with
bronze
mould
that
capped
the
walls
and
the
roof
i
never
left
any
place
with
less
regret
come
let
go
the
three
men
had
covered
some
ground
before
rudolph
broke
the
silence
you
find
a
few
little
things
up
there
in
my
maurice
some
are
marked
for
you
and
the
rest
will
you
send
them
home
please
he
hesitated
i
hope
neither
of
you
will
misunderstand
me
i
horribly
afraid
but
not
but
only
because
this
fellow
will
make
me
look
absurd
if
i
knew
the
first
motion
he
broke
out
angrily
i
can
not
bear
to
have
him
laugh
also
i
can
not
bear
heywood
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
gave
a
queer
cough
if
that
all
never
you
fear
i
teach
you
your
guard
in
a
while
we
can
finish
in
style
eh
rudie
you
blooming
german
i
i
think
we
must
have
been
brothers
we
pull
it
off
yet
heywood
spoke
with
a
strange
alacrity
and
tried
again
to
cough
this
time
however
there
was
no
mistake
he
was
laughing
rudolph
shot
at
him
one
glance
of
startled
unbelief
and
then
tossing
his
head
marched
on
without
a
word
pride
and
loneliness
overwhelmed
him
the
two
at
his
side
were
no
companions
not
even
presences
he
went
alone
conscious
only
of
the
long
flood
of
sunset
and
the
black
interlacing
pattern
of
bamboos
the
one
friendly
spirit
had
deserted
laughing
yet
even
this
last
and
worst
of
earthly
puzzles
did
not
matter
it
was
true
what
he
had
read
this
which
they
called
death
was
a
lonely
thing
on
a
broken
stone
bench
sturgeon
sober
and
dejected
with
puffy
circles
under
his
eyes
sat
waiting
a
long
parcel
wrapped
in
green
baize
lay
across
his
knees
he
nodded
gloomily
without
rising
at
his
feet
wandered
a
path
rankly
matted
with
burnt
weeds
and
bordered
with
green
the
dimples
choked
with
discs
of
mud
the
place
was
a
deserted
garden
where
the
ruins
of
a
european
house
burnt
by
natives
in
some
obscure
madness
years
ago
sprawled
in
desolation
among
wild
shrubs
a
little
way
down
the
path
stood
teppich
and
chantel
each
with
his
back
turned
and
his
hands
clasped
like
a
pair
of
sulky
napoleons
one
fat
one
slender
the
wooden
pretense
of
their
attitude
set
rudolph
for
an
instant
to
laughing
silently
and
bitterly
this
final
scene
what
justice
that
it
should
be
a
mean
waste
the
wreck
of
silly
long
forgotten
and
now
used
only
by
grotesque
he
must
die
in
both
action
and
setting
without
dignity
it
was
some
comfort
he
became
aware
to
find
that
the
place
was
fairly
private
except
for
the
breach
by
which
they
had
entered
the
blotched
and
spotted
compound
walls
stood
ruinous
yet
high
shutting
out
all
but
a
rising
slant
of
sunlight
and
from
some
outpost
line
of
shops
near
by
the
rattle
of
an
abacus
and
the
broken
singsong
of
argument
now
harsh
now
drowsy
heywood
had
been
speaking
earnestly
to
sturgeon
a
little
practice
try
the
balance
of
the
swords
no
more
than
fair
fair
most
certainly
croaked
that
battered
convivialist
chantel
ca
object
he
rose
and
waddled
down
the
path
rudolph
saw
chantel
turn
frowning
then
nod
and
smile
the
nod
was
courteous
the
smile
full
of
satire
the
fat
ambassador
returned
he
puffed
tugging
from
the
baize
cover
a
shining
pair
of
swords
here
try
out
his
puffy
eyes
turned
furtively
toward
rudolph
may
be
bad
form
hackh
but
we
all
wish
you
luck
i
fancy
then
in
a
burst
of
candor
wish
that
unspeakable
ass
felt
as
seedy
as
i
do
drop
dead
that
sort
of
thing
still
grumbling
treason
this
strange
second
rejoined
his
principal
jackets
off
commanded
heywood
and
in
their
cinglets
each
with
sword
under
arm
the
two
friends
took
shelter
behind
a
ragged
clump
of
plantains
the
yellow
leaves
half
dead
with
drought
and
blight
hung
ponderous
as
torn
strips
of
sheet
metal
in
the
lifeless
air
behind
this
tattered
screen
rudolph
studied
for
a
moment
the
lethal
object
in
his
hand
it
was
very
graceful
the
tapering
blade
with
shallow
grooves
in
which
blood
was
soon
to
run
the
silver
hilt
where
his
enemy
father
had
set
in
florid
letters
the
name
of
chantel
and
a
date
how
long
ago
he
thought
the
steel
was
forged
for
this
day
it
is
fate
he
looked
up
sadly
come
show
me
how
to
begin
so
that
i
can
stand
up
to
him
here
then
slowly
easily
his
long
limbs
transformed
with
a
sudden
youthful
grace
heywood
moved
through
the
seven
positions
of
on
guard
try
it
rudolph
learned
only
that
his
own
clumsy
imitation
was
hopeless
once
he
ca
see
us
again
and
again
more
and
more
rapidly
they
performed
the
motions
of
this
odd
rehearsal
suddenly
heywood
stepped
back
and
lowering
his
point
looked
into
his
pupil
face
long
and
earnestly
for
the
last
time
he
said
wo
you
let
me
tell
him
this
is
extremely
silly
rudolph
hung
his
head
like
a
stubborn
child
do
you
still
think
he
answered
coldly
that
i
would
beg
off
with
a
hopeless
gesture
of
impatience
heywood
stepped
forward
briskly
very
well
then
once
more
and
as
their
blades
clashed
softly
together
a
quick
light
danced
in
his
eyes
here
how
our
friend
will
stick
you
his
point
cut
a
swift
little
circle
and
sped
home
by
a
wild
instinct
the
novice
beat
it
awkwardly
aside
his
friend
laughed
poised
again
disengaged
again
but
in
of
this
heartless
play
stumbled
and
came
pitching
forward
rudolph
darted
back
swept
his
arm
blindly
and
cried
out
for
with
the
full
impetus
of
the
mishap
a
shock
had
run
from
wrist
to
elbow
he
dropped
his
sword
and
in
stupefaction
watched
the
red
blood
coursing
down
his
forearm
and
his
third
finger
twitching
convulsively
beyond
control
dear
fellow
cried
his
opponent
scrambling
upright
so
sorry
i
say
that
a
bad
one
with
a
stick
and
a
handkerchief
he
twisted
on
a
tourniquet
muttering
condolence
pain
much
lost
my
balance
you
know
that
better
what
a
clumsy
accident
then
dodging
out
from
the
plantain
screen
and
beckoning
all
you
chaps
come
over
here
nesbit
came
running
but
at
sight
of
the
bloody
victim
pulled
up
short
what
ho
he
whispered
first
with
a
stare
then
a
grin
of
mysterious
joy
sturgeon
gave
a
sympathetic
whistle
and
stolidly
unwound
bandages
at
first
the
two
napoleons
remained
aloof
but
at
last
yielding
to
indignant
shouts
haughtily
approached
the
little
group
stood
at
fault
heywood
wiped
his
very
carefully
on
a
plantain
leaf
then
stood
erect
to
address
them
with
a
kind
of
cool
severity
i
regret
this
more
than
anybody
he
declared
pausing
and
picking
his
words
we
were
at
practice
and
my
friend
had
the
misfortune
to
be
run
through
the
arm
chantel
flung
out
his
hands
in
a
motion
at
once
furious
and
impudent
zut
what
a
farce
will
you
tell
me
please
since
your
friend
has
disabled
himself
heywood
wheeled
upon
him
scornfully
you
have
no
right
to
such
an
expression
he
stated
with
a
coldness
which
conveyed
more
rage
than
the
other
man
heat
this
was
entirely
my
fault
it
i
who
have
spoiled
your
arrangement
and
therefore
i
am
quite
ready
to
take
up
my
friend
quarrel
i
have
no
quarrel
with
you
replied
chantel
contemptuously
you
saw
last
night
how
he
he
was
quicker
than
i
that
all
by
every
circumstance
i
the
natural
proxy
besides
the
young
man
appealed
to
the
company
smiling
besides
what
a
pity
to
postpone
matters
and
spoil
the
occasion
when
doctor
chantel
has
gone
to
the
trouble
of
a
clean
shirt
the
doctor
recoiled
flung
up
a
trembling
arm
and
as
quickly
dropped
it
his
handsome
face
burned
darker
then
faded
with
a
mortal
pallor
and
for
one
rigid
moment
took
on
such
a
strange
beauty
as
though
it
were
about
to
be
translated
into
bronze
his
brown
fingers
twitched
became
all
nerves
and
sinews
and
white
knuckles
then
stepping
backward
he
withdrew
from
the
circle
very
well
he
said
lightly
since
we
are
all
so
irregular
i
will
take
the
substitute
rudolph
gave
a
choking
cry
and
would
have
come
forward
but
sturgeon
clung
to
the
wounded
arm
and
bound
on
his
bandage
hold
still
there
he
scolded
as
though
addressing
a
horse
then
growled
in
heywood
ear
why
did
go
lose
your
temper
did
we
ca
let
him
walk
over
us
though
the
young
man
held
the
sword
across
his
throat
and
whispered
only
angry
up
to
here
and
indeed
through
the
anxious
preliminary
silence
he
stood
waiting
as
cool
and
ready
as
a
young
centurion
his
adversary
turning
back
the
sleeves
of
the
unfortunate
white
linen
picked
up
the
other
sword
and
practiced
his
fingering
on
the
silver
hilt
while
the
blade
answered
as
delicately
as
the
bow
to
a
violinist
at
last
he
came
forward
with
thin
lips
and
hard
thoughtful
eyes
like
a
man
bent
upon
dispatch
both
men
saluted
formally
and
sprang
on
guard
from
the
first
twitter
of
the
blades
even
rudolph
knew
the
outcome
heywood
his
face
white
and
anxious
in
the
failing
light
fought
at
full
stretch
at
the
last
wrench
of
skill
chantel
for
the
moment
was
fencing
and
though
his
attacks
came
ceaseless
and
quick
as
flame
he
was
plainly
prolonging
them
discarding
them
repeating
varying
whether
for
merriment
or
the
vanity
of
perfect
form
or
love
of
his
art
graceful
safe
easy
as
though
performing
the
grand
salute
he
teased
and
frolicked
his
bright
blade
puzzling
the
sight
scattering
like
quicksilver
in
the
endless
whirl
and
clash
teppich
was
gaping
foolishly
sturgeon
shaking
his
head
the
cockney
with
narrow
body
drawn
together
watching
shivering
squatting
on
toes
and
like
a
runner
about
to
spring
from
a
mark
rudolph
dizzy
with
pain
and
suspense
nursed
his
forearm
mechanically
the
hurried
silver
ring
of
the
hilts
dismayed
him
the
dust
from
the
garden
path
choked
him
like
an
acrid
smoke
suddenly
chantel
dropping
low
like
a
deflected
arrow
swooped
in
with
fingers
touching
the
ground
on
three
feet
he
had
delivered
the
blow
so
long
withheld
the
watchers
shouted
nesbit
sprang
up
released
but
heywood
by
some
desperate
sleight
had
parried
the
certainty
and
even
tried
a
riposte
still
afoot
and
fighting
he
complained
testily
above
the
do
shout
like
that
fair
field
you
chaps
above
the
too
came
gradually
a
murmur
of
voices
through
the
dust
beyond
the
lunging
figures
rudolph
was
distantly
aware
of
crowded
bodies
of
yellow
faces
grinning
or
agape
in
the
breach
of
the
compound
wall
men
of
the
neighboring
hamlet
had
gathered
to
watch
the
foreign
monsters
play
at
this
new
fantastic
game
shaven
heads
bobbed
saffron
arms
pointed
voices
sharp
and
guttural
argued
scornfully
the
hilts
rang
the
blades
grated
faster
but
now
it
was
plain
that
heywood
could
do
no
more
by
luck
or
inspiration
fretted
by
his
clumsy
yet
strong
and
close
defense
chantel
was
forcing
on
the
end
he
gave
a
panting
laugh
instantly
all
saw
the
weaker
blade
fly
wide
the
stronger
swerve
to
dart
in
victorious
and
then
saw
doctor
chantel
staggering
backward
struck
full
in
the
face
by
something
round
and
heavy
the
brown
missile
skipped
along
the
garden
path
another
struck
a
and
burst
into
fragments
like
a
bomb
a
third
rebounding
from
teppich
girdle
left
him
bent
and
gasping
strange
yells
broke
out
as
from
a
tribe
of
apes
the
air
was
thick
with
hurtling
globes
cocoanuts
rained
upon
the
company
tempestuously
as
though
an
invisible
palm
were
shaken
by
a
hurricane
among
them
flew
sticks
jagged
lumps
of
clay
thick
scales
of
plaster
aow
cried
nesbit
the
bloomin
coolies
first
to
recover
he
skipped
about
fielding
and
hurling
back
cocoanuts
a
small
but
raging
phalanx
crowded
the
gap
in
the
wall
throwing
continually
howling
and
exhorting
one
another
to
rush
in
a
riot
cried
heywood
and
started
sword
in
hand
come
on
stop
but
it
was
nesbit
who
wrenching
a
pair
of
loose
bottles
from
the
path
brandishing
them
aloft
like
clubs
and
shouting
the
unseemly
of
a
led
the
white
men
into
this
deadly
breach
at
the
first
shock
the
rioters
broke
and
scattered
fled
round
corners
of
the
wall
crashed
through
bamboos
went
leaping
across
toward
the
river
the
tumult
except
for
lonely
howls
in
the
distance
ended
as
quickly
as
it
had
risen
the
little
band
of
europeans
returned
from
the
pursuit
drenched
with
sweat
panting
like
a
squad
of
triumphant
football
players
but
no
one
smiled
that
explains
it
grumbled
heywood
he
pointed
along
the
path
to
where
far
off
a
tall
stooping
figure
paced
slowly
toward
the
town
his
long
robe
a
moving
strip
of
color
faint
in
the
twilight
the
dropped
some
remarks
in
passing
the
others
nodded
moodily
too
breathless
for
reply
nesbit
forehead
bore
an
ugly
cut
rudolph
bandage
was
red
and
sopping
chantel
more
rueful
than
either
stared
down
at
a
bleeding
hand
which
held
two
shards
of
steel
he
had
fallen
and
snapped
his
sword
in
the
rubble
of
old
masonry
no
more
blades
he
said
like
a
child
with
a
broken
toy
there
are
no
more
blades
this
side
of
saigon
then
we
must
postpone
heywood
mopped
his
dripping
and
fiery
cheeks
he
tossed
a
piece
of
silver
to
one
who
wailed
in
the
ditch
a
forlorn
stranger
from
lamenting
the
broken
shells
and
empty
baskets
of
his
small
contribution
you

bad
day
for
imported
cocoanuts

money

excessive
chapter
x
three
portals
not
till
after
dinner
that
evening
did
rudolph
rouse
from
his
stupor
with
the
clerk
he
lay
wearily
in
the
upper
chamber
of
heywood
house
the
host
with
both
his
long
legs
out
at
window
sat
watching
the
smoky
lights
along
the
river
and
now
and
then
cursing
the
heat
after
all
he
broke
silence
those
cocoanuts
came
time
enough
did
they
just
said
nesbit
jauntily
and
fingering
the
plaster
cross
on
his
wounded
forehead
drawled

heywood
and
pulling
in
his
legs
rose
and
stamped
across
the
room
a
glass
of
ice
and
tansan
smashed
on
the
floor
rudolph
was
on
foot
clutching
his
bandaged
arm
as
though
the
hurt
were
new
you
he
stammered
you
did
that
he
stood
gaping
thunderstruck
felt
soles
scuffed
in
the
darkness
and
through
the
door
his
yellow
face
wearing
a
placid
and
lofty
grin
entered

the

he
handed
a
note
to
his

who
snatched
it
as

glad
of

and
scowled
the

at

brown
face
thin
and
comically
small
wore
a
mask
of
inky
shadow
under
a
wicker
bowl
hat
his
eyes
were
cast
down
in
a
strange
fashion
unlike
the
bold
inquisitive
peering
of
his
countrymen
the
more
strange
in
that
he
spoke
harshly
and
abruptly
like
a
racer
catching
breath
i
bring
news
his
dialect
was
the
vilest
and
surliest
form
of
the
colloquial
clear
speech
one
pair
of
ears
enough
you
can
speak
and
act
more
civilly
retorted
heywood
or
taste
the
bamboo
the
man
did
not
answer
or
look
up
or
remove
his
varnished
hat
still
downcast
and
he
sidled
along
the
verge
of
the
shadow
snatched
from
the
table
the
paper
and
a
pencil
and
choosing
the
darkest
part
of
the
wall
began
to
write
the
lamp
stood
between
him
and
the
company
heywood
alone
saw
and
with
a
shock
of
amazement
that
he
did
not
print
vertically
as
with
a
brush
but
scrawled
horizontally
he
tossed
back
the
paper
and
dodged
once
more
into
the
gloom
the
postscript
ran
in
the
same
shaky
hand
send
way
the
others
both
what
cried
the
young
master
of
the
house
and
then
over
his
shoulder
excuse
us
a
moment
me
i
should
say
he
led
the
dwarfish
coolie
across
the
landing
to
the
deserted
the
creature
darted
past
him
blew
out
one
candle
and
thrust
the
other
behind
a
bottle
so
that
he
stood
in
a
wedge
of
shadow
speak
i
ver
badt
he
whispered
and
then
with
something
between
gasp
and
chuckle
but
der
goot
no
when
der
live
dependt
zo
can
mann
he
caught
his
breath
and
trembled
in
a
strong
seizure
good
whispered
heywood
staring
why
man
it
wonderful
you
a
coolie
wutzler
conical
ducked
as
from
a
blow
i
beg
your
pardon
i
mean
you
the
shrunken
figure
pulled
itself
together
you
are
right
he
whispered
in
the
vernacular
i
am
a
coolie
all
but
the
eyes
therefore
this
hat
heywood
stepped
back
to
the
door
and
popped
his
head
out
the
dim
hall
was
empty
go
on
he
said
returning
what
is
your
news
riots
they
are
coming
we
are
all
marked
for
massacre
all
day
i
ran
about
the
town
finding
out
the
trial
of
chok
chung
your
christian
merchant
i
saw
him
the
hall
they
kept
asking
you
follow
the
foreign
dogs
and
goats
but
he
would
only
answer
follow
the
lord
jesus
so
then
they
beat
out
his
teeth
with
a
heavy
shoe
and
cast
him
into
prison
now
they
wait
to
see
if
his
padre
will
interfere
with
the
law
it
is
a
trap
the
suit
is
certainly
brought
by
fang
the
scholar
whom
they
call
the
that
much
said
heywood
i
could
have
told
you
wutzler
glanced
behind
him
fearfully
as
though
the
flickering
shadows
might
hear
but
there
is
more
since
dark
i
ran
everywhere
watching
listening
to
gossip
i
painted
my
skin
with
water
you
know
this
sign
he
patted
his
right
leg
where
the
roll
of
trousers
bound
his
thigh
it
is
for
protection
in
the
streets
it
says
am
a
man
the
triad
heywood
whistled
you
the
other
faltered
and
hung
his
head
yes
he
whispered
at
last
my
my
wife
cousin
he
is
a
grass
sandal
he
taught
her
the
verses
at
home
for
we
mean
no
harm
now
we
of
the
triad
but
there
is
another
secret
band
having
many
of
our
signs
it
is
said
they
ape
our
ritual
fang
the
scholar
heads
their
lodge
they
are
the
white
lotus
white
lotus
heywood
snapped
his
fingers
nonsense
extinct
this
hundred
years
extinct
they
meet
said
the
outcast
in
sudden
grief
and
passion
they
drink
blood
plan
blood
extinct
are
married
to
these
people
does
the
knowledge
come
so
cheap
or
at
a
price
all
these
years
darkness
sunken
alone
he
trembled
violently
but
regained
his
voice
o
my
friend
this
very
night
they
swear
in
recruits
and
set
the
day
i
know
their
for
any
sake
believe
me
i
know
right
said
heywood
curtly
i
believe
you
but
why
come
here
why
not
stay
and
learn
more
wutzler
head
dropped
on
his
breast
again
the
varnished
hat
gleamed
softly
in
the
darkness
i
i
dare
not
stay
he
sobbed
oh
exactly
heywood
flung
out
an
impatient
arm
the
date
man
the
day
they
set
you
came
away
without
it
we
sit
tight
then
and
wait
in
ignorance
the
droll
withered
face
suddenly
raised
shone
with
great
tears
that
streaked
the
mangrove
stain
my
head
sits
loosely
already
with
what
i
have
done
i
found
a
listening
place
next
door
a
long
roof
you
can
hear
and
see
them
but
i
could
not
stay
yes
i
am
a
coward
there
there
heywood
patted
his
shoulder
i
did
mean
here
have
a
drink
the
man
drained
the
tumbler
at
a
gulp
stood
without
a
word
sniffing
miserably
then
of
a
sudden
as
though
the
draught
had
worked
looked
up
bold
and
shrewd
do
you
he
whispered
do
dare
go
to
the
place
i
show
you
and
hide
you
would
learn
heywood
started
visibly
paused
then
laughed
excellent
he
said
is
good
argument
can
you
smuggle
me
then
come
on
he
stepped
lightly
across
the
landing
and
called
out
you
chaps
make
yourselves
at
home
will
you
business
you
know
what
a
bore
i
not
be
back
till
late
and
as
he
followed
the
slinking
form
downstairs
he
grumbled
if
at
all
perhaps
the
moon
still
lurked
behind
the
ocean
making
an
aqueous
pallor
above
the
crouching
roofs
the
two
men
hurried
along
a
goat
path
skirted
the
town
wall
and
stole
through
a
dark
gate
into
a
darker
maze
of
lonely
streets
drawing
nearer
to
a
faint
clash
of
cymbals
in
some
they
halted
before
a
blind
wall
in
the
first
room
whispered
the
guide
a
circle
is
drawn
on
the
floor
put
your
right
foot
there
and
say
are
all
men
if
they
ask
remember
you
go
to
pluck
the
white
lotus
these
men
hate
it
they
are
triad
brothers
they
will
let
you
pass
you
come
from
the
east
where
the
fusang
cocks
spit
orient
pearls
you
studied
in
the
red
flower
pavilion
your
eyes
are
bloodshot
because
he
lectured
earnestly
repeating
desperate
nonsense
over
and
over
no
not
so
say
it
exactly
after
me
they
held
a
hurried
catechism
in
the
dark
there
sighed
wutzler
at
last
that
is
as
much
as
we
can
hope
do
not
forget
they
will
pass
you
through
hidden
but
you
are
very
rash
it
is
not
too
late
to
go
home
receiving
no
answer
he
sighed
more
heavily
and
gave
a
complicated
knock
bars
clattered
within
and
a
strip
of
dim
light
widened
who
comes
said
a
harsh
but
guarded
voice
with
a
strong
hakka
brogue
a
brother
answered
the
outcast
to
pluck
the
white
lotus
aid
go
in
i
can
help
no
further
if
you
are
caught
slide
down
and
run
westward
to
the
gate
which
is
called
the
meeting
of
the
dragons
heywood
nodded
and
slipped
in
beside
a
flame
of
a
broad
squat
giant
sat
stiff
and
still
against
the
opposite
wall
and
stared
with
cruel
unblinking
eyes
if
the
stranger
were
the
first
white
man
to
enter
this
motionless
grim
janitor
gave
no
sign
on
the
earthen
floor
lay
a
small
circle
of
white
lime
heywood
placed
his
right
foot
inside
it
we
are
all
men
pass
said
the
guard
out
from
shadow
glided
a
tall
native
with
a
halberd
who
opened
a
door
in
the
far
corner
in
the
second
room
dim
as
the
first
burned
the
same
smoky
orange
light
on
the
same
table
but
here
a
twisted
cripple
his
nose
long
and
pendulous
with
elephantiasis
presided
over
three
cups
of
tea
set
in
a
row
heywood
lifted
the
central
cup
and
drank
will
you
bite
the
clouds
asked
the
second
guard
in
a
soft
and
husky
bass
as
he
spoke
the
great
nose
trembled
slightly
no
i
will
bite
ginger
replied
the
white
man
why
is
your
face
so
green
it
is
a
a
green
face
with
a
red
heart
pass
said
the
cripple
gently
he
pulled
a
cord
the
nose
quaking
with
this
exertion
and
opened
the
third
door
again
the
chamber
was
dim
a
venerable
man
in
gleaming
silks
a
grandfather
by
his
drooping
moustaches
sat
fanning
himself
in
the
breath
of
his
black
fan
the
lamplight
tossed
queer
shadows
leaping
and
danced
on
the
table
of
polished
camagon
except
for
this
unrest
the
aged
face
might
have
been
carved
from
yellow
soapstone
but
his
slant
eyes
were
the
sharpest
yet
you
have
come
far
he
said
with
sinister
and
warning
courtesy
too
far
thought
heywood
in
a
sinking
heart
but
answered
from
the
east
where
the
fusang
cocks
spit
orient
pearls
and
where
did
you
study
the
black
fan
stopped
fluttering
in
the
red
flower
pavilion
what
book
did
you
read
the
book
said
heywood
holding
his
wits
by
his
will
the
book
was
ten
thousand
thousand
pages
and
the
theme
the
waters
of
the
deluge
crosswise
flow
and
what
the
aged
voice
rose
briskly
what
saw
you
on
the
waters
the
eight
abbots
floating
answered
heywood
but
ran
his
thought
he
pump
me
dry
why
continued
the
examiner
do
you
look
so
happy
because
heaven
has
sent
the
unicorn
the
black
fan
began
fluttering
once
more
it
seemed
a
hopeful
sign
but
the
keen
old
eyes
were
far
from
satisfied
why
have
you
such
a
sensual
face
i
was
born
under
a
peach
tree
pass
said
the
old
man
regretfully
and
heywood
glancing
back
from
the
mouth
of
a
dark
corridor
saw
him
beside
the
table
of
camagon
wagging
his
head
like
a
judge
doubtful
of
his
judgment
the
narrow
passage
hot
fetid
and
blacker
than
the
wholesome
night
without
crooked
about
sharp
corners
that
bruised
the
wanderer
hands
and
arms
suddenly
he
fell
down
a
short
flight
of
slimy
steps
landing
in
noisome
mud
at
the
bottom
of
some
crypt
a
trap
a
suffocating
well
he
thought
and
rose
filthy
choked
with
bitterness
and
disgust
only
the
taunting
justice
of
wutzler
argument
the
retort
had
sent
him
headlong
into
this
dangerous
folly
he
had
scolded
a
coward
with
hasty
words
and
been
forced
to
follow
where
they
led
to
this
loathsome
hole
behind
him
a
door
closed
a
bar
scraped
softly
into
place
before
him
as
he
groped
in
rage
and
rose
a
vault
of
solid
plaster
narrow
as
a
chimney
but
presently
glancing
upward
he
saw
a
small
cluster
of
stars
blinking
voluptuous
immeasurably
overhead
their
pittance
of
light
as
his
eyesight
cleared
showed
a
ladder
rising
flat
against
the
wall
he
reached
up
grasped
the
bamboo
rungs
hoisted
with
an
acrobatic
wrench
and
began
to
climb
cautiously
above
faint
and
muffled
sounded
a
murmur
of
voices
chapter
xi
white
lotus
he
was
swarming
up
quiet
as
a
thief
when
his
fingers
clawed
the
bare
plaster
the
ladder
hung
from
the
square
end
of
a
protruding
beam
above
which
there
were
no
more
rungs
he
hung
in
doubt
then
to
his
great
relief
something
blacker
than
the
starlight
gathered
into
form
over
his
head
a
slanting
bulk
which
gradually
took
on
a
familiar
meaning
he
chuckled
reached
for
it
and
fingering
the
rough
edge
to
avoid
loose
tiles
hauled
himself
up
to
a
foothold
on
the
beam
and
so
flinging
out
his
arms
and
hooking
one
knee
scrambled
over
and
lay
on
a
ribbed
and
mossy
surface
under
the
friendly
stars
the
outcast
and
his
strange
brethren
had
played
fair
this
was
the
long
roof
and
close
ahead
rose
the
wall
of
some
higher
building
an
upright
blackness
from
which
escaped
two
bits
of
light
a
right
angle
of
hairbreadth
lines
and
below
this
a
brighter
patch
small
and
ragged
here
louder
but
confused
with
a
gentle
scuffing
of
feet
sounded
the
voices
of
the
rival
lodge
toward
these
he
crawled
stopping
at
every
creak
of
the
tiles
once
a
broken
roll
snapped
off
and
slid
rattling
down
the
roof
he
sat
up
every
muscle
ready
for
the
sudden
leap
and
shove
that
would
send
him
sliding
after
it
into
the
lower
darkness
it
fell
but
a
short
distance
into
something
soft
gradually
he
relaxed
but
lay
very
still
nothing
followed
no
one
had
heard
he
tried
again
crawled
forward
his
own
length
and
brought
up
snug
and
safe
in
the
angle
where
roof
met
wall
the
voices
and
shuffling
feet
were
dangerously
close
he
sat
up
caught
a
shaft
of
light
full
in
his
face
and
peered
in
through
the
ragged
chink
two
legs
in
bright
wrinkled
hose
and
a
pair
of
black
shoes
with
thick
white
soles
blocked
the
view
for
a
long
time
they
shifted
uneasy
and
tantalizing
he
could
hear
only
a
hubbub
of
talk
random
phrases
without
meaning
the
legs
moved
away
and
left
a
clear
space
but
at
the
same
instant
a
grating
noise
startled
him
directly
overhead
out
of
doors
the
thin
right
angle
of
light
spread
instantly
into
a
brilliant
square
with
a
bang
a
wooden
shutter
slid
open
heywood
lay
back
swiftly
just
as
a
long
fat
bamboo
pipe
two
sleeves
and
the
head
of
a
man
in
a
red
silk
cap
were
thrust
out
into
the
night
air
sighed
the
man
and
puffed
at
his
bamboo
it
is
hot
heywood
tried
to
blot
himself
against
the
wall
the
lounger
propped
on
elbows
finished
his
smoke
spat
upon
the
tiles
and
remained
a
pensive
silhouette
he
sighed
again
then
knocking
out
the
bamboo
drew
in
his
head
not
until
the
shutter
slammed
did
heywood
shake
the
burning
sparks
from
his
wrist
in
the
same
movement
however
he
raised
head
and
shoulders
to
spy
through
the
chink
this
time
the
legs
were
gone
he
saw
clear
down
a
brilliant
lane
of
robes
and
banners
multicolored
and
shining
with
embroidery
and
tinsel
a
lane
between
two
ranks
of
crowded
men
who
splendid
with
green
and
blue
and
yellow
robes
of
ceremony
faced
each
other
in
a
strong
lamplight
that
glistened
on
their
oily
cheeks
the
chatter
had
ceased
under
the
crowded
rows
of
shaven
foreheads
their
eyes
blinked
and
expectant
at
the
far
end
of
the
loft
through
two
circular
arches
or
giant
hoops
of
rattan
heywood
at
last
descried
a
third
arch
of
swords
beyond
this
a
tall
incense
jar
smouldering
gray
wisps
of
smoke
beside
a
transverse
table
twinkling
with
candles
like
an
altar
and
over
these
a
black
image
with
a
pale
carved
face
seated
bolt
upright
before
a
lofty
intricate
gilded
shrine
of
the
patriot
a
tall
man
in
silk
with
a
high
scarlet
turban
moved
athwart
the
altar
chanting
as
he
solemnly
lifted
one
by
one
a
row
of
symbols
a
round
wooden
measure
heaped
with
something
white
like
rice
in
which
stuck
a
gay
cluster
of
paper
flags
a
brown
polished
abacus
a
mace
carved
with
a
dragon
another
carved
with
a
phoenix
a
rainbow
robe
gleaming
with
the
plumage
of
siamese
kingfishers
all
these
and
more
he
displayed
aloft
and
replaced
among
the
candles
when
his
chant
ended
a
brisk
little
man
in
yellow
stepped
forward
into
the
lane
o
fragrant
ones
he
shrilled
i
bring
ten
thousand
recruits
to
join
our
army
and
swear
brotherhood
attend
o
master
of
incense
behind
him
a
squad
of
some
dozen
barefoot
wretches
in
coolie
clothes
with
queues
crawled
on
all
fours
through
the
first
arch
they
crouched
abject
while
the
tall
master
of
incense
in
the
silk
sternly
examined
their
sponsor
in
the
outer
darkness
heywood
craned
and
listened
till
neck
and
shoulders
ached
he
could
make
nothing
of
the
florid
verbiage
with
endless
ritual
the
crawling
novices
reached
the
arch
of
swords
they
knelt
each
holding
above
his
head
a
lighted
bundle
of
red
sparks
that
quivered
like
angry
fireflies
above
them
the
tall
master
of
incense
thundered
o
spirits
of
the
hills
and
brooks
the
land
the
swollen
seeds
of
the
ground
and
all
the
veins
of
earth
o
thou
young
bearer
of
the
axe
that
cleared
the
hills
o
imperial
heaven
and
ye
five
dragons
of
the
five
regions
with
all
the
holy
influences
who
pass
and
instantly
through
unutterable
space
draw
near
record
our
oath
accept
the
draught
of
blood
he
raised
at
arm
length
a
heavy
baton
which
with
a
flowing
movement
unrolled
to
the
floor
a
bright
yellow
scroll
thickly
inscribed
from
this
he
read
slowly
an
interminable
catalogue
of
oaths
heywood
could
catch
only
the
scolding
of
the
responses
if
any
brother
shall
break
this
let
him
die
beneath
ten
thousand
knives
who
violates
this
shall
be
hurled
down
into
the
great
sky
let
thunder
from
the
five
regions
annihilate
him
silence
followed
broken
suddenly
by
the
frenzied
squawking
of
a
fowl
as
suddenly
cut
short
near
the
chink
heywood
heard
a
quick
struggling
and
beating
next
instant
he
lay
flattened
against
the
wall
the
shutter
grated
open
a
flood
of
light
poured
out
within
reach
in
that
radiance
a
pair
of
sinewy
yellow
hands
gripped
the
neck
of
a
white
cock
the
wretched
bird
squawked
once
more
feebly
flapped
its
wings
and
clawed
the
air
just
as
a
second
pair
of
arms
reached
out
and
sliced
with
a
knife
the
cock
head
flew
off
upon
the
tiles
hot
blood
spattered
on
heywood
cheek
half
blinded
but
not
daring
to
move
he
saw
the
knife
withdrawn
and
a
huge
goblet
held
out
to
catch
the
flow
then
arms
goblet
and
convulsive
wings
jerked
out
of
sight
and
the
shutter
slid
home
twice
they
not
seen
me
thought
heywood
it
was
darker
here
than
he
had
hoped
he
rose
more
boldly
to
the
under
the
arch
of
swords
the
new
recruits
now
standing
upright
stretched
one
by
one
their
wrists
over
the
goblet
the
incense
master
pricked
each
yellow
arm
to
mingle
human
blood
with
the
blood
of
the
white
cock
then
from
a
brazen
vessel
filled
the
goblet
to
the
brim
it
passed
from
hand
to
hand
like
a
each
novice
raised
it
chanted
some
formula
and
drank
then
all
dispersed
there
fell
a
silence
suddenly
in
the
pale
face
of
the
black
image
seated
before
the
shrine
the
eyes
turned
scanning
the
company
with
a
cold
contempt
the
lips
moved
the
voice
level
and
ironic
was
that
of
fang
the
o
fragrant
ones
when
shall
the
foreign
monsters
perish
like
this
cock
a
man
in
black
with
a
red
wand
bowed
and
answered
harshly
the
time
great
elder
brother
draws
at
hand
how
shall
we
know
the
hour
the
hour
replied
the
red
wand
shall
be
when
the
black
dog
barks
and
the
day
heywood
pressed
his
ear
against
the
chink
and
listened
his
five
senses
fused
into
one
no
answer
came
but
presently
a
rapid
steady
clicking
strangely
familiar
and
commonplace
he
peered
in
again
the
red
wand
stood
by
the
abacus
rattling
the
brown
beads
with
flying
fingers
like
a
shroff
plainly
it
was
no
real
calculation
but
a
ceremony
before
the
answer
the
listener
clapped
his
ear
to
the
crevice
would
that
answer
he
wondered
be
a
month
a
week
the
shutter
banged
the
light
streamed
down
went
heywood
against
the
plaster
thick
dregs
from
the
goblet
splashed
on
the
tiles
a
head
the
flattened
profile
of
the
brisk
man
in
yellow
leaned
far
out
from
the
little
grunting
he
shook
the
inverted
cup
let
it
dangle
from
his
hands
stared
up
aimlessly
at
the
stars
and
then
to
consternation
dropped
his
head
to
meditate
looking
straight
down
he
sees
me
thought
heywood
and
held
himself
ready
trembling
but
the
fellow
made
no
sign
the
broad
squat
features
no
change
the
pose
was
that
of
vague
comfortable
thought
yet
his
vision
seemed
to
rest
true
as
a
on
the
was
he
in
doubt
he
could
reach
down
lazily
and
feel
worst
of
all
the
greenish
pallor
in
the
eastern
sky
had
imperceptibly
turned
brighter
and
now
the
ribbed
edge
of
a
roof
across
the
way
began
to
glow
like
incandescent
silver
the
moon
was
crawling
up
the
head
and
the
dangling
goblet
were
slowly
pulled
in
just
before
the
moonlight
soft
and
sullen
through
the
brown
haze
of
the
heat
stole
down
the
wall
and
spread
upon
the
tiles
the
shutter
remained
open
but
heywood
drew
a
free
breath
those
eyes
had
been
staring
into
vacancy
now
then
he
thought
and
sat
up
to
the
cranny
for
the
rattle
of
the
abacus
had
stopped
the
counting
is
complete
announced
the
red
wand
slowly
the
hours
are
numbered
the
day
movement
shadow
or
nameless
instinct
made
the
listener
glance
upward
swiftly
he
caught
the
gleam
of
yellow
silk
the
poise
and
downward
jab
and
with
a
great
heave
of
muscles
went
shooting
down
the
slippery
channel
of
the
cock
blood
a
spearhead
grazed
his
scalp
and
smashed
a
tile
behind
him
as
he
rolled
over
the
edge
the
spear
itself
whizzed
by
him
into
the
dark
the
chap
saw
he
thought
in
beastly
clever
all
the
time
he
landed
on
the
in
a
pile
of
dry
rubbish
snatched
up
the
weapon
and
ran
dimly
conscious
of
a
quiet
scurrying
behind
and
above
him
of
silent
men
tumbling
after
and
doors
flung
violently
open
he
raced
blindly
but
whipped
about
the
next
corner
leaving
the
moon
at
his
back
westward
somebody
had
told
him
to
the
gate
where
dragons
met
there
had
been
no
uproar
but
running
his
hardest
down
the
empty
corridors
of
the
streets
he
felt
that
the
pack
was
gaining
ahead
loomed
something
gray
a
wall
the
end
of
a
blind
alley
scale
it
or
make
a
stand
at
the
foot
he
debated
racing
before
the
decision
came
a
man
popped
out
of
the
darkness
heywood
shifted
his
grip
drew
back
the
spear
but
found
the
stranger
bounding
lightly
alongside
and
muttering
to
the
quick
a
brother
waits
i
fool
those
who
follow
obeying
heywood
dove
to
the
left
into
the
black
slit
of
an
alley
while
the
other
fugitive
pattered
straight
on
into
the
seeming
trap
with
a
yelp
of
encouragement
to
the
band
who
swept
after
the
alley
was
too
dark
for
speed
heywood
ran
on
fell
rose
and
ran
fell
again
losing
his
spear
a
pair
of
trembling
hands
eagerly
helped
him
to
his
feet
my
cozin
boy
he
ron
quick
said
wutzler
dose
fellows
dey
not
catch
him
kom
they
threaded
the
gloom
swiftly
wutzler
ready
and
certain
of
his
ground
led
the
tortuous
way
through
narrow
and
greasy
galleries
along
the
side
of
a
wall
and
at
last
through
an
unlighted
gate
free
of
the
town
in
the
moonlight
he
stared
at
his
companion
cackled
clapped
his
thighs
and
bent
double
in
unholy
convulsions
my
gracious
me
he
laughed
immoderately
oh
i
wait
zo

while
he
clung
shaking
to
the
young

look

me
at
last
he
regained
himself
stood
quiet
and
added
very
pointedly
what
did

replied
heywood
angrily
nothing

not
a

wrung
each

oh
for
me
all
you
haf
done
the
outcast
turned
away
shaking
his
head
sadly
never
did
heywood
fat
glisten
more
welcome
than
when
he
gained
the
vaulted
he
ripped
off
his
clothes
scrubbed
the
sacrificial
clots
from
his
hair
and
splashed
the
cool
water
luxuriously
over
his
exhausted
body
when
at
last
he
had
thrown
a
kimono
about
him
and
wearily
climbed
the
stairs
he
was
surprised
to
see
rudolph
in
the
room
ahead
pacing
the
floor
and
ardently
twisting
his
little
moustache
as
heywood
entered
he
wheeled
stared
long
and
solemnly
i
must
wait
to
tell
you
he
stalked
forward
and
with
his
sound
left
hand
grasped
heywood
right
this
afternoon
you
my
dear
boy
it
too
hot
no
speeches
but
rudolph
emotion
would
not
be
hindered
this
afternoon
he
persisted
with
tragic
voice
and
eyes
this
afternoon
i
nearly
was
killed
so
was
which
seems
to
meet
that
and
heywood
pulled
free
oh
cried
rudolph
fervently
i
know
i
feel
if
you
knew
what
i
my
life
the
weary
stoic
in
the
blue
kimono
eyed
him
very
coldly
then
plucked
him
by
the
come
here
for
a
bit
both
men
leaned
from
the
window
into
the
hot
airless
night
a
chinese
rebeck
wailed
monotonous
and
nasal
heywood
pointed
at
the
moon
which
now
hung
clearly
above
the
copper
haze
what
do
you
see
there
he
asked
dryly
the
moon
replied
his
friend
wondering
you
know
i
was
afraid
you
might
just
see
rudie
hackh
the
rebeck
wailed
a
long
complaint
before
he
added
if
i
did
like
you
fairly
well
the
point
is
good
old
cynthia
that
bally
orb

not
see
one
of

next
quarter

rigmarole
drawled
heywood
and
abstained
from
glancing
at
chantel
dare
say
however
gilly
their
rigmarole
mean
business
on
that
supposition
i
made
my
notes
urgent
to
you
chaps
quite
right
said
forrester
tugging
his
gray
moustache
and
studying
the
floor
obviously
rigmarole
or
not
your
plan
is
thoroughly
sound
stock
one
house
and
if
the
pinch
comes
fortify
chantel
drummed
on
heywood
long
table
and
smiled
quaintly
with
eyes
which
roved
out
at
window
and
from
mast
to
bare
mast
of
the
few
small
junks
that
lay
moored
against
the
distant
bank
he
bore
himself
like
a
lazy
cock
of
the
walk
the
rest
of
the
council
nesbit
teppich
sturgeon
kempner
and
the
great
padre
surrounded
the
table
with
thoughtful
faces
when
they
looked
up
their
eyes
went
straight
to
heywood
at
the
head
so
that
though
deferring
to
his
elders
the
youngest
man
plainly
presided
chantel
turned
suddenly
merrily
his
teeth
flashing
in
a
laugh
if
we
are
then
afraid
let
us
all
take
a
jonc
down
the
river
he
scoffed
or
the
next
vessel
for
hongkong
gilly
tired
honest
eyes
saw
only
the
plain
statement
impossible
he
shook
his
bullet
head
we
ca
run
away
from
a
rumor
you
know
can
we
now
the
women
perhaps
but
we
should
lose
face
no
end
horribly
let
come
to
facts
urged
heywood
arms
for
example
what
have
we
to
my
knowledge
one
pair
of
good
rifles
mine
and
sturgeon
ammunition
uncertain
but
limited
two
revolvers
my
and
that
little
thing
of

which
is
not

but
you

just
taken

oh
i
say
forrester
looked
up
with
an
injured
air
as
the
senior
here
except
earle
i
naturally
thought
the
choice
would
be
my
house
right
cried
two
or
three
voices
from
the
foot
of
the
table
it
should
be
farthest
off
all
talked
at
once
except
chantel
who
eyed
them
leniently
and
smiled
as
at
so
many
absurd
children
kempner
a
pale
dogged
man
with
a
pompous
white
moustache
which
pouted
and
bristled
while
he
spoke
rose
and
delivered
a
pointless
oration
ignoring
race
and
creed
he
droned
we
must
stand
together
heywood
balanced
a
pencil
twirled
it
and
at
last
took
to
drawing
on
the
polished
wood
he
scratched
with
great
pains
the
effigy
of
a
pig
whose
snout
blared
forth
a
gale
of
whistle
away
he
muttered
then
resumed
as
if
no
one
had
interrupted
very
good
of
you
gilly
but
with
your
permission
i
see
five
here
a
rough
sketch
made
some
time
ago
he
tossed
on
the
table
a
sheet
of
paper
forrester
spread
it
frowning
while
the
others
leaned
across
or
craned
over
his
chair
all
out
of
whack
you
see
explained
the
draughtsman
but
here
are
my
points
gilly
one
your
house
lies
quite
inland
with
four
sides
to
defend
the
river
and
marsh
give
rudie
but
two
and
a
fraction
boats
not
hardly
we
soon
stop
that
as
you
see
if
they
dare
anyhow
point
two
your
house
is
all
hillocks
behind
and
shops
roundabout
here
just
one
low
ridge
and
the
rest
clear
field
third
the
portuguese
built
a
well
of
sorts
in
the
courtyard
water
deadly
i
dare
say
but
your
place
has
no
well
whatever
and
as
to
four
suppose
in
a
sudden
alarm
say
those
cut
off
by
land
could
run
another
to
reach
the
place
by
by
the
way
the
nunnery
has
a
bell
to
ring
gilbert
forrester
shoved
the
map
along
to
his
neighbor
and
cleared
his
throat
gentlemen
he
declared
slowly
you
once
did
me
the
honor
to
say
that
in
in
a
certain
event
you
would
consider
me
as
acting
head
frankly
i
confess
my
plans
were
quite
ah
vague
i
wish
to
briefly
to
resign
in
favor
of
this
young
ah
bachelor
do
go
rotting
me
complained
heywood
and
his
sallow
cheeks
turned
ruddy
i
merely
bring
up
these
points
and
five
is
this
your
compound
very
cramped
where
the
nunnery
could
shelter
the
goodly
blooming
fellowship
of
native
converts
chantel
laughed
heartily
and
stretched
his
legs
at
ease
under
the
table
illustration

what
strategy
he
chuckled
preening
his
moustache
your
mythical
siege
it
will
be
brief
for
me
i
vote
no
to
that
no
filling
their
bellies
eating
us
into
a
surrender
he
made
a
pantomime
of
a
compound
full
eating
eating
one
or
two
nodded
approving
the
retort
heywood
slightly
lifting
his
chin
stared
at
the
speaker
coldly
down
the
length
of
their
the
red
in
his
cheeks
burned
darker
our
everlasting
shame
then
he
replied
quietly
it
will
be
everlasting
if
we
leave
these
poor
devils
in
the
lurch
after
cutting
them
loose
from
their
people
excuse
me
padre
but
it
no
time
to
mince
our
words
we
made
them
strangers
in
their
own
land
desert
damned
if
we
do
no
one
made
reply
the
padre
who
had
looked
up
looked
down
quickly
musing
and
smoothed
his
white
hair
with
big
fingers
that
somewhat
trembled
besides
continued
the
speaker
in
a
tone
of
apology
we
need
to
man
the
works
meantime
you
chaps
must
lend
coolies
eh
look
here
with
rising
spirits
he
traced
an
eager
finger
along
the
map
i
must
run
a
good
strong
bamboo
scaffold
along
the
inside
wall
with
plenty
of
ready
for
loopholing
specially
atop
the
servants
quarters
and
and
in
that
northeast
angle
where
we
throw
up
a
mound
or
what
do
you
say
suggestions
please
chantel
humming
a
tune
reached
for
his
helmet
and
rose
he
paused
struck
a
match
and
in
an
empty
glass
shielding
the
flame
against
the
breeze
of
the
punkah
lighted
a
cigarette
since
we
have
appointed
our
dictator
he
began
amiably
we
may
repose
from
the
landing
without
a
coolie
bawled
impudently
for
the
master
of
the
house
wutzler
said
heywood
jumping
up
i
mean
his
messenger
he
was
gone
a
noticeable
time
but
came
back
smiling
good
news
gilly
he
held
aloft
a
scrap
of
chinese
paper
scrawled
on
with

need
expect

his
reports

little
is
chantel
still
humming
had
moved
toward
the
door
all
at
once
he
halted
and
stared
from
the
landward
window
cymbals
clashed
somewhere
below
what
this
he
cried
sharply
the
noise
drew
nearer
more
brazen
and
with
it
a
clatter
of
hoofs
here
come
swordsmen
to
play
with
you
i
suppose
your
fame
has
spread
heywood
spoke
with
a
slow
mischievous
drawl
but
he
crossed
the
room
quickly
what
up
below
by
the
open
gate
a
gay
grotesque
rider
reined
in
a
piebald
pony
and
leaning
down
handed
to
the
a
ribbon
of
scarlet
paper
behind
him
to
the
clash
of
cymbals
a
file
of
men
in
motley
robes
swaggered
into
position
wheeled
and
formed
the
ragged
front
of
a
falstaff
regiment
overcome
by
the
scarlet
ribbon
the
boy
bowed
just
as
through
the
gate
like
a
boat
swept
under
an
arch
came
heaving
an
unwieldy
screened
chair
borne
by
four
broad
men
not
naked
and
glistening
coolies
but
horses
in
proud
livery
before
they
could
lower
their
shafts
heywood
ran
clattering
down
the
stairs
slowly
cautiously
like
a
little
fat
old
woman
there
clambered
out
from
the
broadcloth
box
a
rotund
man
in
flowing
silks
and
a
conical
tasseled
hat
of
fine
straw
he
waddled
down
the
compound
path
shading
with
his
fan
a
shrewd
bland
face
thoughtful
yet
smooth
as
a
babe
the
watchers
in
the
upper
room
saw
heywood
greet
him
with
extreme
ceremony
and
heard
the
murmur
of
pray
you
i
pray
you
as
with
endless
bows
and
deprecations
the
two
men
passed
from
sight
within
the
house
a
long
time
dragged
by
the
visitor
did
not
join
the
company
but
from
another
room
now
and
then
sounded
his
voice
full
of
odd
and
courteous
modulations
when
at
last
the
conference
ended
and
their
unmated
footsteps
crossed
the
landing
a
few
sentences
echoed
from
the
stairway
that
is
all
declared
the
voice
pleasantly
the
chow
ceremonial
says
man
is
unwise
who
knowingly
throws
away
precious
things
and
in
the
analects
we
read
is
merit
in
dispatch
heywood
reply
was
lost
except
the
words
stupid
people
in
every
nation
agreed
the
placid
voice
it
is
true

up
the

headed
by

lictors
with

swaying
past

heywood
when
he
returned
was
grinning
wonderful
old
chap
he
exclaimed

much
as

chantel
from
a
derisive
near
the
window
had
turned
to
waddle
solemnly
down
the
room
at
sight
of
heywood
face
he
stopped
guiltily
chantel
all
the
laughter
was
gone
from
the
voice
and
the
hard
gray
eyes
yesterday
we
humored
you
fashion
but
put
away
childish
i
like
that
magistrate
plainly
a
damned
deal
better
than
i
like
you
when
you
or
i
show
one
half
his
ability
we
free
to
mock
him
in
my
house
for
the
first
time
within
the
memory
of
any
man
present
the
mimic
wilted
i
i
did
not
know
he
stammered
that
old
man
was
your
friend
very
quiet
and
a
little
flushed
he
took
his
seat
among
the
others
i
like
him
no
end
still
more

his

in

heywood

dodged

was
forced
on
him
some
understrapper
tried
it
let
be
fair
earle
great
elbows
left
the
board
without
rising
he
seemed
to
grow
in
bulk
and
stature
and
send
his
vision
past
the
company
into
those
things
which
are
not
to
confound
the
things
which
are
for
myself
it
does
not

buries
his
workmen
but
carries
on
his
work
the
man
spoke
in
a
heavy
broken
voice
as
though
it
were
his
body
that
suffered
but
it
comes
hard
to
hear
from
a
young
man
so
good
a
friend
after
many
years
the
eyes
returned
and
with
a
sudden
lustre
made
a
sharp
survey
from
face
to
face

i
have
made
my

tell
me
what

i

shut

never
meddled
never
not
even
when
money
was
levied
for
the
village
idols
and
here
a
man
beaten
cast
into
prison
he
shoved
both
fists
out
on
the
table
and
bowed
his
white
head

nothing

yours

tell
me
repeated
the
other
stubbornly
at
the
same
moment
it
happened
that
the
cries
came
louder
along
the
and
that
some
one
bounded
up
the
stairs
the
runner
was
rudolph
all
morning
he
had
gone
about
his
errands
very
calmly
playing
the
man
of
action
in
a
new
philosophy
learned
overnight
but
now
he
forgot
to
imitate
his
teacher
and
darted
in
so
headlong
that
all
the
dogs
came
with
him
bouncing
and
barking
look
he
called
stumbling
toward
the
farther
window
while
flounce
the
terrier
and

puppy
ran
nipping
at

at

out
on

chapter
xiii
the
spare
man
beyond
the
scant
greenery
of
heywood
garden
a
ropy
little
banyan
a
low
rank
of
glossy
whampee
leaves
and
the
dusty
tops
of
stunted
olives
glared
the
river
wide
savage
sunlight
lay
so
hot
upon
it
that
to
aching
eyes
the
water
shone
solid
like
a
broad
road
of
yellow
clay
only
close
at
hand
and
by
an
effort
of
vision
appeared
the
tiny
quiet
lines
of
the
irresistible
flood
pouring
toward
the
sea
there
whipped
into
the
pool
of
banyan
shade
black
snippets
and
tails
of
reflection
darting
ceaselessly
after
each
other
like
a
shoal
of
frightened
minnows
but
elsewhere
the
river
lay
golden
solid
and
painfully
bright
things
afloat
in
the
slumberous
procession
of
all
eastern
rivers
swam
downward
imperceptibly
now
blurred
now
outlined
in
corrosive
sharpness
the
white
men
stood
crowding
along
the
spacious
window
the
dogs
barked
outrageously
but
at
last
above
their
din
floated
as
before
the
high
wailing
cries
a
heaping
cairn
of
earthen
jars
came
steering
past
poled
by
a
naked
statue
of
new
copper
who
balanced
precariously
on
the
edge
of
his
hidden
raft
no
sound
came
from
him
nor
from
the
funeral
barge
which
floated
next
where
still
figures
in
white
robes
guarded
the
vermilion
drapery
of
a
bier
decked
with
vivid
green
boughs
all
these
were
silent
no
above
cried
rudolph
pointing
after
the
mourners
barge
at
some
distance
came
hurrying
a
boat
crowded
with
shining
yellow
bodies
and
dull
blue
jackets
long
bamboo
poles
plied
bumping
along
her
gunwale
sticking
into
the
air
all
about
her
many
and
loose
and
incoordinate
like
the
ribs
of
an
unfinished
basket
from
the
bow
spurted
a
white
puff
of
smoke
the
dull
report
of
a
musket
lagged
across
the
water
the
bullet
skipped
like
a
schoolboy
pebble
ripping
out
little
rags
of
white
along
that
surface
of
liquid
clay
the
line
of
fire
thus
revealed
revealed
the
mark
untouched
a
black
head
bobbed
vigorously
in
the
water
some
few
yards
before
the
boat
the
saffron
crew
poling
faster
yelled
and
cackled
at
so
clean
a
miss
while
a
coolie
in
the
bow
reloaded
his
matchlock
the
fugitive
head
labored
like
that
of
a
man
not
used
to
swimming
and
desperately
spent
it
now
gave
a
quick
twist
and
showed
a
distorted
face
almost
of
the
same
color
with
the
water
the
mouth
gaped
black
in
a
sputtering
cry
then
closed
choking
squirted
out
water
and
gaped
once
more
to
wail
clearly
i
am
jesus
christ
in
the
broad
bare
daylight
of
the
river
this
lonely
and
sudden
blasphemy
came
as
though
a
person
in
a
dream
might
declare
himself
to
a
waking
audience
of
skeptics
the
cry
sharp
with
forlorn
hope
rang
like
an
appeal
why
look
stammered
heywood
he
sees
us
heading
here
look
it
quick
let
me
out
just
as
he
turned
to
elbow
through
his
companions
and
just
as
the
cry
sounded
again
the
matchlock
blazed
from
the
bow
no
bullet
skipped
the
swimmer
who
had
reached
the
shallows
suddenly
rose
with
an
incredible
heave
like
a
leaping
salmon
flung
one
bent
arm
up
and
back
in
the
gesture
of
the
laocoön
and
pitched
forward
with
a
turbid
splash
the
quivering
darkness
under
the
banyan
blotted
everything
death
had
dispersed
the
black
minnows
there
in
oozy
wriggles
of
shadow
but
next
moment
the
stripes
chased
in
a
more
lively
shoal
the
gleaming
potter
below
his
rosy
cairn
stared
the
mourners
forgot
their
grief
heywood
after
his
impulse
of
rescue
stood
very
quiet
you
saw
he
repeated
dully
you
all
saw
the
clutching
figure
bolt
upright
in
the
soaked
remnant
of
prison
rags
had
in
that
leap
and
fall
shown
himself
for
chok
chung
the
christian
he
had
sunk
in
mystery
to
become
at
one
forever
with
the
drunken
obscene
delight
raged
in
the
crowded
boat
with
yells
and
laughter
and
flourish
of
bamboo
poles
come
away
from
the
window
said
heywood
and
then
to
the
doctor
your
question
answered
padre
strange
to
come
so
quick
he
jerked
his
thumb
back
toward
the
river
and
that
only
first
blood
the
others
had
broken
into
wrangling
escaped
nonsense
cat
and
mouse
game
i
tell
you
those
devils
let
him
go
merely
to
we
never
know
of
course
plain
as
your
nose
to
stand
by
and
never
lift
a
hand
oh
it
rot
look
here
why
acquitted
then
set
on
him
but
we
know
fang
watching
on
the
spot
trust
him
a
calm
boy
in
gown
stood
beside
them
ready
to
speak
the
dispute
paused
while
they
turned
for
his
message
it
was
a
disappointing
trifle
forrester
waited
below
for
her
husband
to
walk
home
ca
leave
now
snapped
gilly
i
be
along
tell
her
had
she
better
go
alone
suggested
heywood
no
right
you
are
the
other
swept
a
fretful
eye
about
the
company
but
this
business
begins
to
look
here
somebody
we
can
spare
you
go
hackh
there
a
good
chap
chantel
dropped
the
helmet
he
had
caught
up
bowing
stiffly
rudolph
marched
across
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
his
face
pale
at
the
late
spectacle
had
grown
red
and
sulky
can
spare
me
can
you
i
the
one
he
descended
muttering
viewing
himself
thus
morosely
as
rejected
of
men
he
reached
the
compound
gate
to
fare
no
better
with
the
woman
she
stood
waiting
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
and
as
he
drew
unwillingly
near
the
sight
of
her
to
his
shame
and
quick
dismay
made
his
heart
leap
in
welcome
she
wore
the
coolest
and
severest
white
but
at
her
throat
the
same
small
furbelow
every
line
of
which
he
had
known
aboard
ship
in
the
days
of
his
first
exile
and
of
his
recent
youth
it
was
now
as
though
that
youth
came
flooding
back
to
greet
her
he
forgot
everything
except
that
for
a
few
priceless
moments
they
would
be
walking
side
by
side
she
faced
him
with
a
start
never
so
young
and
beautiful
as
now
her
blue
eyes
wide
scornful
and
blazing
her
cheeks
red
and
lips
trembling
like
a
child
ready
to
cry
i
did
not
want
she
said
curtly
nor
did
they
pride
forged
the
retort
for
him
at
a
blow
he
explained
in
the
barest
of
terms
while
she
eyed
him
steadily
with
every
sign
of
rising
temper
i
can
spare
you
too
she
whipped
out
then
turned
to
walk
away
holding
her
helmet
erect
in
the
poise
of
a
young
goddess
pert
but
warlike
this
double
injustice
left
rudolph
chafing
in
two
strides
however
he
had
overtaken
her
i
am
under
orders
he
stated
grimly
her
pace
gradually
slackened
in
the
growing
heat
but
she
went
forward
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
littered
sunken
flags
of
their
path
this
rankling
silence
seemed
to
him
more
unaccountable
and
deadly
than
all
former
mischances
and
left
him
far
more
alone
from
the
sultry
tops
of
bamboos
drooping
like
plants
in
an
oven
an
amorous
multitude
of
cicadas
maintained
the
buzzing
torment
of
steel
on
emery
wheels
as
though
the
universal
heat
had
chafed
and
fretted
itself
into
a
dry
feverish
utterance
once
forrester
looked
about
quick
and
angry
like
one
ready
to
choke
that
endless
voice
but
for
the
rest
the
two
strange
companions
moved
steadily
onward
in
an
alley
of
checkered
light
a
buffalo
with
a
wicker
and
heavy
sagging
horns
that
seemed
to
jerk
his
head
back
in
agony
heaved
toward
them
ridden
by
a
naked
yellow
infant
in
a
saddle
of
green
fodder
scenting
with
fright
the
disgusting
presence
of
white
aliens
the
monster
shied
opened
his
eyes
and
lowered
his
blue
muzzle
as
if
to
charge
there
was
a
pause
full
of
menace
do
run
said
rudolph
and
catching
the
woman
roughly
about
the
shoulders
thrust
her
behind
him
she
clutched
him
tightly
by
the
wounded
arm
the
buffalo
stared
irresolute
with
evil
eyes
the
naked
boy
in
the
green
nest
brushed
a
swarm
of
flies
from
his
handful
of
sticky
sweetmeats
looked
up
pounded
the
clumsy
shoulders
and
shrilled
a
command
staring
doubtfully
and
trembling
the
buffalo
swayed
past
the
wrinkled
armor
of
his
gray
hide
plastered
with
dry
mud
as
with
yellow
ochre
to
the
slow
click
of
hoofs
the
surly
monster
guided
by
a
little
child
went
swinging
down
the
pastoral
shade
ancient
yet
living
shapes
from
a
picture
immemorial
in
art
and
poetry
please
begged
rudolph
trying
with
his
left
hand
to
loosen
her
grip
please
that
hurts
for
a
second
they
stood
close
their
fingers
interlacing
with
a
touch
of
contempt
he
found
that
she
still
trembled
and
drew
short
breath
her
eyes
slowly
gathered
his
meaning
oh
that
she
tore
her
hand
loose
as
though
burned
that
it
all
true
then
i
forgot
she
caught
aside
her
skirts
angrily
and
started
forward
in
all
her
former
disdain
but
this
after
their
brief
alliance
was
not
to
be
tolerated
what
was
all
true
he
insisted
you
shall
not
treat
me
so
if
anybody
has
a
right
after
several
paces
she
flashed
about
at
him
in
a
whirl
of
words
all
alike
every
one
of
you
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
think
you
were
different
the
conflict
in
her
eyes
showed
real
beyond
suspicion
he
told
me
all
about
it
last
evening
and
you
dare
talk
of
rights
and
come
following
me
here
lucky
i
did
retorted
rudolph
with
sudden
spirit
and
holding
out
his
wounded
arm
indignantly
that
scratch
if
you
know
how
it
came
i
know
perfectly
she
stared
as
at
some
crowning
impudence
he
was
you
came
off
i
know
all
you
said
but
the
one
thing
i
never
understand
is
where
you
found
the
courage
after
he
struck
you
at
the
club
you
always
have
to
admire
after
he
struck
a
light
broke
in
on
rudolph
somehow
chantel
oh
that
liar
he
wheeled
and
started
to
go
back
wait
stop
she
called
in
a
strangely
altered
voice
which
brought
him
up
short
they
all
with
him
now
you
ca
what
did
you
mean
he
explained
sulkily
at
first
but
ending
in
a
kind
of
generous
rage
so
i
could
even
stand
up
to
him
and
except
for
maurice
heywood
oh
you
need
not
frown
he
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
forrester
had
walked
on
with
the
same
cloudy
aspect
the
same
light
impatient
step
he
felt
the
greater
surprise
when
suddenly
turning
she
raised
toward
him
her
odd
enticing
pointed
face
and
the
friendly
mischief
of
her
eyes
the
best
she
echoed
in
the
same
as
when
she
had
flattered
him
that
afternoon
in
the
dusky
well
of
the
pagoda
stairway
the
very
best
friend
do
you
think
you
have
a
better
rudolph
stared
oh
you
funny
funny
boy
she
cried
with
a
bewildering
laugh
of
delight
and
pride
i
hate
people
all
prim
and
circumspect
and
you
you
have
flown
back
there
straight
at
him
before
my
before
all
the
others
that
why
i
like
you
so
but
you
must
leave
that
horrid
lying
fellow
to
me
all
unaware
she
had
led
him
along
the
blinding
white
wall
of
the
forrester
compound
and
halted
in
the
hot
shadow
that
lay
under
the
tiled
gateway
as
though
timidly
her
hand
stole
up
and
rested
on
his
forearm
so
sorry
the
confined
space
narrow
and
covered
gave
to
her
voice
a
plaintive
ring
that
twice
you
protected
me
and
i
hurt
you
different
this
does
happen
between
people
often
when
you
did
that
for
me
yesterday
did
it
seem
different
and
rather
splendid
and
like
a
book
it
seemed
nonsense
replied
rudolph
sturdily
the
heat
we
were
fools
she
laughed
again
and
at
close
range
watched
him
from
under
consciously
drooping
lashes
that
almost
veiled
a
liquid
brilliancy
everywhere
the
cicadas
kept
the
heat
vibrating
with
their
strident
buzz
it
recalled
some
other
widespread
mist
of
treble
music
long
ago
the
trilling
of
frogs
that
had
been
before
you
dear
brave
boy
she
said
slowly
you
so
honest
too
i
not
ungrateful
do
you
know
what
i
like
oh
there
the
she
drew
back
with
an
impatient
gesture
that
stupid
fat
earle
waiting
for
i
hate
to
leave
you
the
stealthy
brightness
of
her
admiration
changed
to
a
slow
inscrutable
appeal
do
forget
have
you
a
better
friend
and
with
an
instant
bold
and
tantalizing
grimace
she
had
vanished
within
to
his
homeward
march
her
cicadas
shrilled
the
music
of
fifes
he
the
despised
the
man
to
spare
now
cocked
up
his
helmet
like
minion
dizzy
with
new
honors
nobody
had
ever
praised
him
to
his
face
and
now
she
she
of
all
the
world
had
spoken
words
which
he
feared
and
longed
to
believe
and
which
even
said
still
less
than
her
searching
and
mysterious
look
on
the
top
of
his
exultation
he
reached
the
nunnery
and
entered
his
big
bare
to
find
heywood
stretched
in
a
wicker
chair
hallo
rudie
i
asked
myself
to
tiffin
drawled
the
lounger
from
a
little
tempest
of
blue
smoke
tossed
by
the
punkah
how
the
fair
bertha
mausers
all
right
and
by
the
way
did
you
make
that
inventory
of
provisions
rudolph
faced
him
with
a
sudden
conviction
of
guilt
of
treachery
to
a
leader
yes
he
stammered
i
i
get
it
for
you
he
passed
into
his
bedroom
caught
up
the
written
list
from
a
table
and
for
a
moment
stood
as
if
dreaming
before
him
the
mausers
polished
and
orderly
shone
in
their
new
rack
against
the
wall
though
appearing
to
scan
them
rudolph
saw
nothing
but
his
inward
confusion
after
all
this
man
did
for
me
he
mused
what
had
loosed
the
bond
swept
away
all
the
effects
a
sound
near
the
window
made
him
turn
an
imp
in
white
and
red
livery
pêng
the
little
from
the
club
stood
hurling
things
violently
into
the
outer
glare
what
thing
you
do
called
rudolph
sharply
some
small
but
heavy
object
clattered
on
the
floor
the
urchin
stooped
snatched
it
up
and
flung
it
hurtling
clean
over
the
garden
to
the
river
he
turned
grinning
amiably
how
too
you
too
he
chanted
i
am
welly
glat
you
a
he
explained
had
called
this
house
bad
names
he
pêng
threw
stones
bad
man
out
of
here
you
rascal
rudolph
flicked
a
at
the
scampering
legs
as
the
small
defender
of
his
honor
bolted
for
the
stairs
what
wrong
heywood
appeared
promptly
at
the
door
from
the
road
below
a
gleeful
voice
piped
in
the
noon
blaze
pêng
skipped
derisively
jeered
at
them
performed
a
brief
but
indecorous
pantomime
and
then
kicking
up
his
heels
with
joy
scurried
for
his
life
chucked
his
billet
said
heywood
without
surprise
little
devil
i
always
thought
what
missing
rudolph
scanned
his
meagre
belongings
rummaged
his
opened
a
wardrobe
nothing
he
answered
a
but
heywood
had
darted
to
the
rack
of
mausers
knelt
and
sprung
up
raging
man
he
cried
in
a
voice
that
made
rudolph
jump
man
why
did
you
stop
him
the
all
but
young
heathen
he
crippled
us
one
pair
of
rifles
left
chapter
xiv
off
duty
the
last
of
the
sunlight
streamed
level
through
a
gap
in
the
western
ridges
it
melted
with
sinuous
tender
shadows
the
dry
contour
of
field
and
knoll
and
poured
over
all
the
parching
land
a
liquid
undulating
grace
like
the
shadow
of
clouds
on
ripe
corn
the
red
tiles
of
the
village
roofs
patched
the
countryside
from
the
distant
sea
had
come
a
breath
of
air
cool
enough
to
be
felt
with
gratitude
yet
so
faint
as
neither
to
disturb
the
dry
pulsation
of
myriad
nor
to
blur
the
square
mirrors
of
distant
still
tropically
blue
or
icy
with
reflected
clouds
miss
drake
paused
on
the
knoll
and
looked
about
her
this
remains
the
same
does
it
for
all
our
troubles
she
said
then
to
herself
slowly
is
a
beauteous
evening
calm
and
free
heywood
made
no
pretense
of
following
her
look
nun
he
blurted
no
how
does
it
go
again
child
that
walkest
with
me
here
the
girl
started
down
the
slope
with
the
impatience
of
one
whose
mood
is
frustrated
the
climate
had
robbed
her
cheeks
of
much
color
but
not
it
seemed
of
all
your
fault
said
heywood
impenitent
merely
to
show
you
i
could
quote
once
aged
man
she
laughed
as
though
glad
of
this
turn
i
like
you
better
in
prose
go
on
please
where
we
left
off
what
did
you
do
then
heywood
smile
half
earnest
half
mischievous
obediently
faded
oh
that
why
then
of
course
i
discharged
rudolph
gatekeeper
put
a
trusty
of
my
own
in
his
place
sent
out
to
hire
a
diver
and
turned
all
hands
to
hunting
as
gilly
would
we
picked
up
two
in
the
garden
by
the
wall
one
in
the
mud
outside
and
three
the
diver
got
in
shallow
water
total
recovered
six
plus
two
pêng
had
no
time
for
eight
we
can
ill
spare
four
guns
though
and
the
affair
shows
they
keep
a
beastly
close
watch
yes
said
miss
drake
absently
then
drew
a
slow
breath
pêng
was
the
most
promising
pupil
we
had
he
was
stated
her
companion
a
little
unmitigated
skipping
goblin
she
made
no
reply
as
they
footed
slowly
along
the
winding
path
flounce
the
who
had
scouted
among
strange
clumps
of
bamboo
now
rejoined
them
briskly
cantering
with
her
delicately
stiff
and
joyful
miss
drake
stooped
to
pat
her
saying
poor
little
dog
little
foreign
dog
she
rose
with
a
sigh
to
add
incongruously
oh
the
things
we
dream
beforehand
and
then
the
things
that
happen
i
do
know
heywood
looked
at
her
keenly
sometimes
they
the
same
the
jealous
terrier
scored
her
dusty
paws
down
his
white
drill
from
knee
to
ankle
before
he
added
you
know
how
the
queen
of
heaven
won
her
divinity
another
said
the
girl
of
your
heathen
stories
rather
a
pretty
one
he
retorted
it
happened
in
a
seaport
a
good
many
hundred
miles
up
the
coast
a
poor
girl
lived
there
with
her
mother
in
a
hut
one
night
a
great
gale
blew
so
that
everybody
was
anxious
three
junks
were
out
somewhere
at
sea
in
that
storm
the
girl
lay
there
in
the
dark
her
sweetheart
on
board
it
would
be
in
a
western
story
but
these
were
only
her
friends
and
kin
and
townsmen
that
were
at
stake
so
she
lay
there
in
the
hut
you
see
and
could
rest
and
then
it
seemed
to
her
in
the
dark
that
she
was
swimming
out
through
the
storm
out
and
out
and
not
in
the
least
afraid
she
had
become
larger
and
more
powerful
somehow
than
the
rain
or
the
dark
or
the
whole
ocean
for
when
she
came
upon
the
junks
tossing
there
she
took
one
in
each
hand
the
third
in
her
mouth
and
began
to
swim
for
home
just
retrieved
you
know
but
then
across
the
storm
she
heard
her
mother
calling
in
the
dark
and
had
to
open
her
mouth
to
answer
so
she
lost
that
junk
well
then
her
spirit
was
back
in
the
hut
but
next
day
the
two
junks
came
in
the
third
one
never
and
for
that
dream
she
was
made
after
her
death
the
great
and
merciful
queen
of
heaven
as
heywood
ended
they
were
entering
a
pastoral
village
near
the
town
but
hidden
low
under
great
trees
ancient
and
widely
gnarled
you
told
that
said
miss
drake
as
though
it
had
really
happened
if
you
believe
these
things
have
reality
if
not
they
have
none
his
gesture
as
he
repeated
the
native
maxim
committed
him
to
neither
side
miss
drake
looked
back
toward
the
hills
her
dream
was
play
compared
to
some
that
he
answered
is
abominably
true
the
curt
significant
tone
made
her
glance
at
him
quickly
in
her
dark
eyes
there
was
no
impatience
but
only
trouble
we
do
better
she
said
when
we
are
both
busy
he
nodded
as
though
reluctantly
agreeing
not
so
much
to
the
words
as
to
the
silence
which
followed
the
evening
peace
which
lay
on
the
fields
and
hills
had
flooded
even
the
village
streets
without
pause
without
haste
the
endless
labor
of
the
day
went
on
as
quiet
as
a
summer
cloud
meeting
or
overtaking
coolies
passed
in
single
file
their
bare
feet
slapping
the
enormous
flags
of
antique
sunken
granite
their
twin
baskets
bobbing
and
creaking
to
the
rhythm
of
their
wincing
trot
the
yellow
muscles
rippled
strongly
over
straining
ribs
as
with
serious
faces
and
slant
eyes
intent
on
their
path
they
chanted
in
pairs
the
ageless
refrain
the
call
and
answer
which
make
burdens
lighter
o
heh
o
ha
o
ho
ho
o
heh
o
ha
o
ho
ho
from
hidden
places
sounded
the
whir
of
a
wheel
a
cobbler
rattle
or
the
clanging
music
of
a
forge
yet
everywhere
the
slow
movements
the
faded
tranquil
colors
dull
blue
garments
dusky
red
tiles
deep
foliage
overhanging
a
vista
of
subdued
white
and
gray
consorted
with
the
spindling
shadows
and
vesper
light
keepers
of
humble
shops
lounged
in
the
open
air
with
their
gossips
smoking
bright
pipes
of
the
yunnan
white
copper
nodding
and
blinking
gravely
above
them
no
less
courteous
and
placid
little
doorway
shrines
besought
the
to
lead
the
giver
of
wealth
within
sometimes
where
a
narrow
lane
gaped
opposite
a
door
small
stone
lions
sat
grinning
upon
pillars
to
scare
away
the
secret
arrow
of
misfortune
but
these
rarely
the
village
seemed
a
happy
place
favored
of
the
influences
in
the
grateful
coolness
men
came
and
went
buying
joking
offering
neighborly
advice
to
people
a
plump
woman
who
carried
two
tiny
silver
fish
in
an
immense
flat
basket
grinned
at
miss
drake
and
pointed
roguishly
see
the
two
boats
going
by
she
called
her
feet
are
bigger
than
my
golden
lilies
and
laughing
she
wriggled
her
own
dusty
toes
strong
free
and
perfect
in
modeling
an
old
withered
barber
looked
up
from
shaving
a
blue
forehead
under
a
tree
their
women
he
growled
are
shameless
and
walk
everywhere
but
a
stern
man
bearing
a
fan
and
a
lark
in
a
cage
frowned
him
down
she
brought
my
son
safe
out
of
the
three
sicknesses
he
declared
mind
your
trade
catcher
of
lively
ones
then
bending
over
the
cage
with
solicitude
he
began
gently
to
fan
the
lark
as
heywood
and
the
girl
paused
beside
him
he
glanced
up
and
smiled
gravely
i
give
my
pet
his
airing
he
said
and
then
quickly
but
quietly
when
you
reach
the
town
do
not
pass
through
the
west
quarter
it
is
full
of
persons
their
placards
are
posted
a
shrill
trio
of
naked
boys
came
racing
and
squabbling
to
offer
grasshoppers
for
sale
we
have
seen
no
placards
replied
heywood
you
will
said
the
owner
of
the
lark
calmly
and
squatting
became
engrossed
in
poking
a
grasshopper
between
the
brown
varnished
splints
of
the
cage
maker
of
music
here
is
your
evening
rice
the
two
companions
passed
on
with
flounce
timidly
at
heel
you
see
heywood
broke
out
warnings
everywhere
now
please
you
listen
to
my
advice
no
telling
when
the
next
ship
call
but
when
it
does
i
ca
run
away
she
spoke
as
one
clinging
to
a
former
answer
i
must
stand
by
my
dream
such
as
it
used
to
be
and
even
such
as
it
is
he
eyed
her
sadly
shook
his
head
and
said
no
more
for
a
moment
they
halted
where
the
path
broadened
on
a
part
shade
part
luminous
with
golden
dust
a
squad
of
lank
boys
kicking
miraculously
with
flat
upturned
soles
kept
a
wicker
ball
shining
in
the
air
as
true
and
lively
as
a
plaything
on
a
beyond
their
tiny
juniors
girls
and
boys
and
fat
tumbling
babies
in
rainbow
finery
all
and
singing
turned
their
circle
inside
out
and
back
again
in
the
dizzy
graces
of
the
water
wheel
other
boys
and
girls
still
trousered
and
queued
like
boys
played
at
hopscotch
in
and
out
among
shoes
that
lay
across
the
road
all
traffic
even
the
steady
trotting
coolies
fetched
a
lenient
compass
roundabout
lucky
hand
lucky
hand
allow
me
to
pass
begged
a
man
bent
under
a
plank
these
boards
are
heavy
ho
lame
chicken
called
another
blocked
by
the
he
was
a
brown
who
grinned
and
fondled
a
smoky
cloth
that
buzzed
some
tribe
of
wild
bees
captured
far
afield
ho
lame
chicken
do
not
bump
me
they
will
sting
he
came
through
safely
for
at
the
same
moment
the
musical
of
a
bell
turned
the
game
into
a
race
the
way
was
clear
also
for
a
tiny
aged
collector
of
paper
flying
the
gay
flag
of
an
exalted
literary
society
and
plodding
between
two
great
baskets
on
his
pious
rounds
revere
and
spare
he
piped
at
intervals
revere
and
spare
the
written
word
all
the
bright
picture
lingered
with
the
two
alien
wayfarers
long
after
they
had
passed
and
the
sun
had
withdrawn
from
their
path
in
the
hoary
peace
of
twilight
what
can
do
here
the
girl
cried
abruptly
there
i
never
meant
to
say
it
but
it
runs
in
my
head
all
the
time
i
work
and
work
to
keep
it
down
what
can
we
do
here
heywood
watched
her
face
set
straight
before
them
and
now
more
clearly
cut
in
the
failing
light
were
there
only
pride
in
those
fine
and
resolute
lines
it
might
have
been
a
face
from
some
splendid
coin
or
medal
of
victory
you
work
too
hard
he
said
think
instead
of
all
the
good
but
at
that
she
seemed
to
wince
the
good
as
if
there
were
dark
streets
and
crooked
children
at
home
oh
the
pride
and
ignorance
that
sent
me
here
she
spoke
quietly
with
a
kind
of
wonder
just
blind
ignorant
feelings
i
took
them
for
for
something
too
great
and
mysterious
it
all
very
strange
to
look
back
on
and
try
to
put
into
words
i
remember
painted
glass
and
solemn
music
and
thinking
then
that
i
knew
this
lovely
and
terrible
world
and
its
maker
and
master
she
looked
down
the
dusky
lanes
where
glowworm
lanterns
began
to
bob
and
wink
oh
this
land
where
you
see
the
days
running
into
years
the
dragon
a
wise
old
beast
he
ventured
he
teaches
something
she
assented
gravely
and
in
those
days
i
thought
it
was
a
dark
continent
of
lost
souls
there
are
no
dark
continents
declared
heywood
suddenly
in
a
broken
voice
the
heart
of
one
man
can
hold
more
darkness
you
would
never
see
into
it
do
she
cried
sharply
what
did
we
promise
they
stood
close
in
the
dusk
and
a
tremor
a
wave
passed
through
them
both
i
forgot
i
could
help
he
stammered
then
as
they
stumbled
forward
he
regained
his
former
tone
keen
and
ready
must
get
to
fussing
about
our
work
must
we
curious
thing
speaking
of
dreams
you
know
the
other
night
i
thought
you
were
somewhere
out
on
board
a
junk
and
flounce
with
you
i
swam
like
anything
miles
and
miles
but
could
get
out
to
you
worked
like
steam
and
no
headway
flounce
knew
i
was
coming
but
you
did
deuced
odd
how
real
it
seemed
she
laughed
as
though
they
had
walked
past
some
danger
and
speaking
of
dragons
she
rejoined
they
help
the
man
in
the
story
that
dipped
in
dragon
blood
was
made
invulnerable
oh
he
stood
plainly
at
a
loss
oh
i
see
german
was
he
pity
they
did
pop
rudie
hackh
in
her
swift
upward
glance
might
have
been
admiration
if
she
had
not
said
your
mind
works
very
slowly
oh
again
he
paused
as
though
somewhat
hurt
then
answered
cheerfully
dare
say
always
did
thought
at
first
you
meant
the
kind
from
sumatra
the
gate
of
the
town
yawned
black
from
the
streets
glimmered
a
few
lanterns
like
candles
in
a
long
cave
but
shunning
these
unfriendly
corridors
he
led
her
roundabout
now
along
the
walls
now
through
the
dim
ways
of
an
outlying
hamlet
a
prolonged
shriek
of
growing
fright
and
anguish
came
slowly
toward
them
the
cry
of
a
wheelbarrow
carrying
the
great
carcass
of
a
pig
waxy
white
and
waxy
red
like
an
image
from
a
chamber
of
horrors
in
the
blue
twilight
fast
deepening
the
most
familiar
things
became
grotesque
a
woman
voice
telling
stories
behind
shadow
pictures
and
the
capricious
play
of
the
black
puppets
on
her
lighted
screen
had
the
effect
of
incantation
before
the
booth
of
a
dentist
the
long
strings
of
black
teeth
swayed
in
the
rattling
like
horrid
necklaces
of
cannibals
and
from
a
squat
den
where
on
a
translucent
placard
in
the
dull
window
flickered
the
words
foreign
earth
and
the
guttering
hinted
as
you
like
it
there
came
a
sweet
insidious
potent
smell
that
seemed
more
poisonous
than
mere
opium

said
the
girl
somehow
the
dark
makes
me
uneasy
skirting
the
town
they
struck
at
last
the
open
road
beyond
and
saw
against
a
fading
sky
the
low
black
bulk
of
the
nunnery
pierced
with
orange
squares
past
its
landward
wall
lanterns
moved
slowly
clustered
here
and
there
by
twos
and
threes
and
dispersed
cackling
argument
came
from
the

wherever
the
halted
and
on
the
face
of
the

among
elbowing
shadows
shone

strips
of

both

of

were

of

rudolph
met
them
with
awkward
ceremony
and
with
that
smiling
air
of
encouragement
which
a
nurse
might
use
in
trying
cheerfully
to
deceive
a
sick
man
heywood
laughed
without
mercy
at
this
pious
fraud
hallo
you
ghost
he
cried
we
came
early
straight
from
our
walk
are
the
rest
coming
and
did
my
cook
arrive
to
help
yours
their
host
carried
by
assault
at
once
became
less
mournful
the
cook
is
here
he
replied
by
the
they
disagree
i
think
i
have
asked
everybody
we
should
have
a
full
good
said
his
friend
and
then
whispering

act
as
though
you
expected
the
ghost
of
banquo
in
the
bare
white
loft
by
sturgeon
sat
midway
in
some
long
and
wheezy
tale
to
which
the
padre
and
his
wife
listened
with
true
forbearance
greetings
over
the
stodgy
annalist
continued
the
story
was
forgotten
as
soon
as
ended
talk
languished
and
even
by
the
quaking
light
of
the
candles
it
was
plain
that
the
silence
was
no
mere
waiting
solemnity
before
meat
but
a
period
of
tension
the
relief
came
oddly
up
from
the
road
sounded
a
hubbub
of
voices
the
tramp
of
feet
and
loud
halloos
by
jove
cried
sturgeon
like
a
man
who
fears
the
worst
and
for
all
his
bulk
he
was
first
at
the
window
a
straggling
file
of
lanterns
borne
by
some
small
army
came
jogging
and
crowding
to
a
halt
under
the
walls
yellow
faces
gleamed
faintly
bare
heads
bobbed
and
men
set
down
burdens
grunting
among
the
vanguard
an
angry
voice
scolded
in
a
strange
tongue
suar
it
raged
then
hailed
imperiously
hai
where
the
lanterns
clustered
brightest
an
active
little
figure
in
white
waved
a
helmet
crying
on
deck
where
the
devil
does
maurice
heywood
live
i
up
here
called
that
young
man
for
reply
the
stranger
began
to
skip
among
his
cohorts
jerking
out
his
white
legs
like
a
dancing
marionette
then
with
a
sudden
he
sent
the
helmet
flickering
high
into
the
darkness
over
the
wall
here
we
come
he
shouted
in
hilarious
warning
the
squabbling
retinue
surged
after
him
through
the
gate
and
one
by
one
the
lanterns
disappeared
under
the
covered
way
it
the
captain
laughed
heywood
in
amazement

he
ca
be
sober
all
stared
for
captain
kneebone
after
one
historically
brief
and
outspoken
visit
had
never
in
all
these
years
set
foot
in
the
port
the
two
young
men
hurried
to
the
stairs
chinamen
and
lanterns
crowded
the
courtyard
stuffed
the
passage
and
still
came
straggling
in
at
the
gate
by
the
noise
and
clatter
it
might
have
been
a
caravan
or
a
band
of
robbers
bringing
plunder
everywhere
on
the
stone
flags
coolies
were
dumping
down
bundles
boxes
crammed
with
heavy
objects
among
them
still
brawling
in
bad
hindustani
the
little
captain
gave
his
orders
at
sight
of
heywood
however
he
began
once
more
to
caper
with
extravagant
grimaces
by
his
smooth
ruddy
face
and
tunic
of
purest
white
he
seemed
a
runaway
parson
gone
farther
wrong
than
ever
i
come
to
stay
a
month
he
cried
and
dancing
up
caught
hands
and
whirled
him
about
i
was
fair
bursting
to
see
ye
my
boy
and
here
we
are
at
last
though
his
cheeks
were
flushed
and
eyes
alarmingly
bright
he
was
beyond
question
sober
over
his
head
heywood
and
rudolph
exchanged
an
anxious
glance
good
but
this
is
hackh
house
the
nunnery
said
the
one
and
the
other
added
you
just
in
time
for
dinner
the
captain
found
these
facts
to
be
excruciating
he
clapped
rudolph
on
the
arm
and
crowed
nunnery
we
make
it
a
bloomin
chummery
dinner
be
a
banquet
what
more
i
brought
the
chow
he
swept
the
huddled
boxes
with
a
prodigal
gesture
lashin
o
food
and
drink
that
what
it
is
a
banquet
he
turned
again
to
his
sweating
followers
and
flung
the
head
coolie
a
handful
of
silver
crying

be

with

not

then
pouncing
on
the
nearest
crate
he
burst
it
open
with
a
ferocious
kick
stores
the
choicest
to
be
in
all

look
here
he
held
up
a
tin
and
scanned
the
label
triumphantly

what
never
saw

spelt
with
an
before
did
ye
french
my
boy
bad
spellers
but
good
cooks
are
the
french
heywood
lost
his
worried
frown
something
had
happened
evidently
at
calcutta
for
the
captain
always
picked
up
his
vernacular
where
he
dropped
his
latest
cargo
but
at
all
events
these
vagaries
were
not
the
effect
of
heat
or
loneliness
what
up
captain
he
laughed
but
now
that
the
coolies
had
gone
captain
kneebone
heels
were
busy
staving
open
boxes
right
and
left
a
bottle
rolled
out
and
smashed
in
a
hissing
froth
of
champagne
plenty
more
he
cried
rejoicing
that
shows
ye
how
much
care
oho
suddenly
he
turned
from
this
destruction
and
facing
heywood
began
mysteriously
to
exult
over
him
old
fool
and
his
earnings
eh
fixed
ideas
eh
good
says
you
cock
wo
fight
says
you
it
what
price
fixed
ideas
now
the
eyes
of
his
young
friend
widened
in
unbelief
no
he
cried
with
a
start
you
have
the
captain
seized
both
hands
again
and
took
on
for
his
height
a
roman
stateliness
i
have
he
nodded
solemnly
bar
sells
i
have
no
more
now
we
we
announce
it
at
the
banquet
announce
the
word
first
time
in
life
announce
heywood
suddenly
collapsed
on
a
sack
and
laughed
himself
into
abject
silence
awfully
glad
old
chap
he
at
last
contrived
to
say
and
again
choked
the
captain
looked
down
at
the
shaking
body
with
a
singular
benign
and
fatherly
smile
a
funny
world
ai
it
he
declared
sagely
i
known
this
boy
a
long
time
he
explained
to
rudolph
this
matter
we
let
you
in
presently
lend
me
some
coolies
here
while
we
turn
your
dinner
into
my
banquet
eh
you
do
care
once
in
a
bloomin
lifetime
with
a
seafaring
bellow
he
helped
rudolph
to
hail
the
quarters
a
pair
of
cooks
a
pair
of
number
twos
and
all
the
youngsters
of
two
households
came
shuffling
into
the
court
and
arriving
guests
found
all
hands
broaching
cargo
in
a
loud
confusion
of
orders
and
miscomprehension
the
captain
dinner
was
the
more
brilliant
throughout
the
long
white
room
in
the
slow
breeze
of
the
punkah
scores
of
candles
burned
soft
and
tremulous
as
though
the
old
days
had
returned
when
the
brown
sisters
lighted
their
refectory
but
never
had
their
table
seen
such
profusion
of
viands
or
of
talk
and
laughter
the
saigon
stores
after
daily
fare
seemed
of
a
strange
and
corinthian
luxury
the
wine
proved
excellent
and
his
ruddy
little
face
beaming
at
the
head
of
the
table
wore
an
extravagant
infectious
grin
his
quick
blue
eyes
danced
with
the
light
of
some
ineffable
joke
he
seemed
a
conjurer
creating
banquets
for
sheer
mischief
in
the
wilderness
there
a
soup
he
had
proclaimed
patent
mind
ye
stick
a
knife
into
the
tin
and
she
among
all
the
revelers
one
face
alone
showed
melancholy
chantel
at
the
foot
of
the
table
sat
unregarded
by
all
save
rudolph
who
now
and
then
caught
from
him
a
look
filled
with
gloom
and
suspicion
it
was
beside
rudolph
that
forrester
laughed
and
chattered
calling
all
eyes
toward
her
and
yet
finding
private
intervals
in
which
to
dart
a
sidelong
shaft
at
her
neighbor
rudolph
ears
shone
coral
pink
for
now
again
he
was
aboard
ship
hiding
a
secret
at
once
dizzy
dangerous
and
entrancing
across
the
talk
the
wine
the
many
lights
came
the
triumph
of
seeing
that
other
hostile
face
glowering
in
defeat
never
before
had
chantel
and
all
the
others
dwindled
so
far
into
such
nonentity
or
her
presence
vibrated
so
near
soon
he
became
aware
that
captain
kneebone
had
risen
with
a
face
glowing
red
above
the
candles
even
sturgeon
forgot
the
flood
of
bounties
and
looked
expectantly
toward
their
source
the
captain
cleared
his
throat
faltered
then
turning
sheepish
all
at
once
hung
his
head
be
i
ca
make
a
speech
after
all
he
grumbled
and
wheeling
suddenly
on
heywood
with
a
peevish
air
of
having
been
defrauded
aboard
ship
i
could
sit
and
think
up
no
end
o
flowery
talk
and
now
it
all
gone
he
stared
at
his
plate
miserably
it
was
miss
drake
who
came
to
his
rescue
tell
us
the
secret
she
begged
how
do
you
manage
all
these
nice
things
the
captain
eyes
surveyed
the
motley
collection
down
the
length
of
the
bright
table
then
returned
to
her
gratefully
this
ai
anything
only
a
little
bloomin
impromptu
suggested
heywood
that
the
word
captain
kneebone
eyed
them
both
with
uncommon
favor
that
it
ye
know
i
just
about
saigong
like
a
jackdaw
picking
up
these
impromptus
but
i
came
here
all
the
way
to
break
the
news
proper
by
word
o
mouth
he
faced
the
company
and
gathering
himself
for
the
effort
i
rich
he
declared
i
da
i
remarkable
rich
pausing
for
the
effect
he
warmed
to
his
oratory
it
ai
for
me
to
boast
sailormen
as
a
rule
are
bad
hands
to
save
money
but
i
won
first
prize
in
the
derby
sweepstake
and
the
money
safe
to
my
credit
at
the
and
in
calcutta
and
retired
and
going
home
more
money
than
the
old
kut
sing
earned
since
her
launching
so
much
i
was
frightened
first
and
lost
my
sleep
and
me
without
chick
nor
child
as
the
saying
is
to
go
home
and
live
luxurious
ever
after
ow
cried
nesbit
lucky
beggar
sincerely
glad
said
forrester
and
a
volley
of
compliments
went
round
the
board
the
captain
plainly
took
heart
and
flushing
still
redder
at
so
much
praise
and
good
will
stood
now
at
ease
chuckling
most
men
he
began
when
there
came
a
lull
most
men
makes
a
will
after
they
dead
that
a
shore
way
o
doing
things
now
want
to
see
the
effects
living
so
be
here
goes
right
and
proper
to
miss
drake
for
her
hospital
and
kiddies
two
thousand
rupees
in
the
laughter
and
friendly
uproar
the
girl
sat
dazed
what
shall
i
say
she
whispered
wavering
between
amusement
and
distress
i
ca
accept
it
nonsense
grumbled
heywood
with
an
angry
glance
do
spoil
the
happiest
evening
of
an
old
man
life
you
right
she
answered
quickly
and
when
the
plaudits
ended
she
thanked
the
captain
in
a
very
simple
pretty
speech
which
made
him
duck
and
grin
a
proud
little
benefactor
that
ai
all
he
cried
gayly
then
leveled
a
threatening
finger
like
a
pistol
at
her
neighbor
who
poked
fun
at
me
first
and
last
who
always
came
out
aboard
to
tell
me
what
an
old
ass
i
was
fixed
ideas
eh
no
go
look
you
here
what
did
i
come
so
many
hundred
miles
for
to
say
what
i
always
said
the
eyes
keen
with
and
the
lonely
sight
of
many
far
horizons
suffered
an
indescribable
change
my
boy
the
half
yours
there
two
rich
men
here
i
come
to
take
you
home
it
was
heywood
turn
to
be
struck
dumb
he
grew
very
pale
oh
i
say
he
stammered
at
last
it
not
fair
do
spoil
the
happiest
evening
whispered
the
girl
beside
him
he
eyed
her
ruefully
groaned
then
springing
up
went
swiftly
to
the
head
of
the
table
and
wrung
the
captain
brown
paw
without
a
word
to
say
can
do
can
do
said
captain
kneebone
curtly
i
was
afraid
ye
might
not
want
to
come
then
followed
a
whirlwind
and
teppich
rose
with
his
moustache
bristling
and
the
ready
nesbit
jerked
him
down
again
in
the
opening
sentence
and
everybody
laughed
at
heywood
who
sat
there
so
white
with
such
large
eyes
and
the
dinner
going
by
on
the
wings
of
night
the
melancholy
boy
circled
the
table
all
too
soon
with
a
new
silver
casket
full
of
noble
cigars
from
paiacombo
manila
and
dindigul
as
the
three
ladies
passed
the
foot
of
the
table
rudolph
saw
forrester
make
an
angry
signal
and
presently
like
a
prisoner
going
to
his
judge
chantel
slipped
out
of
the
room
he
was
not
missed
for
already
the
streaming
stood
wreathed
in
blue
layers
nor
was
it
long
before
the
captain
mounting
his
chair
held
a
full
glass
aloft
here
he
cried
in
triumph
here
to
every
nail
in
the
hoof
the
glass
crashed
into
splinters
and
froth
a
flying
stone
struck
the
boom
of
the
punkah
and
thumped
on
the
table
through
the
open
windows
from
the
road
came
a
wild
chorus
of
yells
caught
up
and
echoed
by
many
voices
in
the
distance
shutters
called
heywood
quick
as
they
slammed
them
home
more
stones
drummed
on
the
boards
and
clattered
against
the
wall
conches
brayed
somewhere
followed
by
an
unaccountable
sputtering
fusillade
as
of
tiny
muskets
and
then
by
a
formidable
silence
while
the
banqueters
listened
in
the
smoky
room
there
came
a
sullen
heavy
sound
like
a
single
stroke
on
a
large
and
very
slack
fai
shrilled
the
voices
below
and
then
in
a
fainter
gabble
as
though
hurrying
off
toward
the
sound
fai
the
black
dog
said
heywood
quietly
he
has
barked
earlier
than
we
figured
gilly
lucky
the
scaffolding
up
gentlemen
we
all
know
our
posts
guns
are
in
the
first
bedroom
quietly
now
rudie
go
call
chantel
do
frighten
the
women
if
they
ask
about
that
noise
tell
anything
dragon
boat
festival
beginning
we
can
easily
hold
this
place
while
the
captain
gets
out
to
his
ship
the
captain
wheeled
with
an
injured
air
what
ship
he
inquired
testily
told
ye
plain
i
was
retired
came
the
last
bit
in
a
stinking
native
boat
and
cleared
by
now
think
i
carry
ships
in
my
pocket
outside
the
swollen
discord
of
shouts
thunder
of
gongs
and
hoarse
calling
of
the
conches
came
slowly
nearer
extending
through
the
darkness
chapter
xvi
the
gunwale
rudolph
mission
began
quietly
with
a
glimpse
which
he
afterward
recalled
as
incredibly
peaceful
two
of
the
women
at
least
showed
no
fear
in
the
sat
earle
her
chin
cramped
on
her
high
bosom
while
she
mournfully
studied
his
colored
of
the
rhine
miss
drake
who
leaned
in
one
of
the
river
windows
answered
him
saying
rather
coldly
that
chantel
and
forrester
had
gone
down
to
the
garden
in
the
court
however
he
ran
across
ah
pat
loitering
beside
a
lantern
the
compradore
grinned
and
in
a
tone
of
great
unconcern
called
out
that
the
pair
were
not
in
the
garden
walkee
so
he
pointed
down
the
passage
to
the
main
gate
and
hooked
his
thumb
toward
the
right
to
indicate
their
course
makee
finish
makee
die
now
he
added
calmly
too
muchee
no
can
rudolph
experienced
his
first
shock
of
terror
like
an
icy
blow
on
the
scalp
they
had
gone
outside
before
the
alarm
she
bertha
was
swept
away
in
that
tumult
which
came
raging
through
the
he
stood
transfixed
but
only
for
an
instant
rather
by
the
stroke
of
helplessness
than
by
fear
and
then
blindly
without
plan
or
foresight
darted
down
the
covered
way
the
tiny
flame
of
a
pith
wick
floating
in
a
saucer
of
oil
showed
heywood
gatekeeper
sitting
at
his
post
like
a
gnome
in
the
gallery
of
a
mine
rudolph
tore
away
the
bar
heard
the
heavy
gate
slam
shut
and
found
himself
running
down
the
starlit
road
not
all
starlight
however
a
dim
red
glow
began
to
flicker
on
the
shapes
which
rushed
behind
him
in
his
flight
wheeling
once
he
saw
two
broad
flames
leaping
high
in
wild
and
splendid
rivalry
one
from
heywood
house
one
from
the
club
he
caught
also
a
whirling
impression
of
many
heads
and
arms
far
off
tiny
black
and
crowded
in
rushing
disorder
of
pale
torches
in
the
road
and
of
a
hissing
snarling
shout
a
single
word
like
repeated
incessantly
in
a
high
key
the
flame
at
the
club
shot
up
threefold
with
a
crash
and
a
glorious
multitude
of
sparks
flew
hissing
through
the
treetops
like
fiery
tadpoles
through
a
net
he
turned
and
ran
on
dazzled
fell
over
some
one
who
lay
groaning
rose
on
hands
and
knees
groped
in
the
dust
and
suddenly
fingered
thin
rough
cloth
warm
and
sopping
in
a
nausea
of
relief
he
felt
that
this
was
a
native
some
unknown
dying
man
who
coughed
like
a
drunkard
rudolph
sprang
up
and
raced
again
following
by
habit
the
path
which
he
and
she
had
traversed
at
noon
once
with
a
heavy
collision
he
stopped
short
violently
in
the
midst
of
crowded
men
who
shouted
clung
to
him
wrestling
and
struck
out
with
something
sharp
that
ripped
his
tunic
he
kicked
shook
them
off
hammered
his
fists
right
and
left
and
ran
free
with
a
strange
conviction
that
he
was
invincible
stranger
still
as
the
bamboo
leaves
now
and
then
brushed
his
bare
forehead
he
missed
the
sharp
music
of
her
cicadas
the
looming
of
a
wall
checked
him
here
stood
her
house
she
had
the
briefest
possible
start
of
him
and
he
had
run
headlong
the
whole
way
by
all
the
certainty
of
instinct
he
knew
that
he
had
chosen
the
right
path
why
then
had
he
not
overtaken
her
if
she
met
that
band
which
he
had
just
broken
through
he
wavered
in
the
darkness
and
was
turning
wildly
to
race
back
when
a
sudden
light
sprang
up
before
him
in
her
window
he
plunged
forward
in
at
the
gate
across
a
plot
of
turf
stumbled
through
the
goddess
of
mercy
bamboo
that
hedged
the
door
and
went
falling
up
the
dark
stairs
crying
aloud
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
bertha
bertha
empty
rooms
rang
with
the
name
but
no
one
answered
at
last
however
reaching
the
upper
level
he
saw
by
lamplight
through
the
open
door
two
figures
struggling
just
before
he
entered
she
tore
herself
free
and
went
unsteadily
across
the
room
chantel
white
and
abject
turned
as
in
panic
oh
plainly
he
had
not
expected
to
see
another
face
as
white
as
his
own
breathless
and
trembling
he
spoke
in
a
strangely
little
voice
but
his
staring
eyes
lighted
with
a
sudden
and
desperate
resolution
help
me
with
her
he
begged
she
wo
listen
the
woman
out
of
her
wits
he
caught
rudolph
by
the
arm
and
standing
for
a
moment
like
close
friends
the
two
panting
rivals
watched
her
in
stupefaction
she
ransacked
a
great
cedar
chest
a
table
shelves
boxes
and
strewed
the
contents
on
the
floor
silk
scarfs
shining
benares
brass
chinese
silver
vivid
sarongs
from
the
preanger
regency
kyoto
cloisonné
a
wild
heap
of
plunder
from
the
bazaars
of
all
the
nations
where
gilly
meagre
earnings
had
been
squandered
a
cingalese
box
dropped
and
burst
open
scattering
bright
stones
false
or
precious
broadcast
she
trampled
them
in
her
blind
and
furious
search
come
said
chantel
and
snatched
at
her
leave
those
come
to
the
boat
every
minute
she
pushed
him
aside
like
a
thing
without
weight
or
meaning
stooped
again
among
the
gay
rubbish
caught
up
a
necklace
flung
it
down
for
the
sake
of
a
brooch
then
dropped
everything
and
turned
with
blank
dilated
eyes
and
the
face
of
a
child
lost
in
a
crowd
rudolph
she
whimpered
help
me
what
shall
i
do
without
waiting
for
answer
she
bent
once
more
to
sort
and
discard
her
pitiful
treasures
to
pause
vaguely
consider
and
wring
her
hands
rudolph
in
his
turn
caught
her
by
the
arm
but
fared
no
better
we
must
humor
her
whispered
chantel
and
kneeling
like
a
peddler
among
the
spread
on
the
floor
a
java
sarong
blue
and
brown
painted
with
men
and
buffaloes
on
this
he
began
to
heap
things
the
woman
surrendered
and
all
at
once
flung
her
arms
about
rudolph
hiding
her
face
and
clinging
to
him
as
if
with
the
last
of
her
strength
come
he
bring
them
she
sobbed
let
go
to
the
boat
he
must
find
his
own
way
take
me
hurry
and
fright
choked
her
take
me
leave
him
if
he
wo
come
i
scolded
him
then
the
noises
came
and
we
ran
what
boat
said
rudolph
chantel
did
not
look
up
i
have
one
ready
and
stocked
he
mumbled
tugging
with
his
teeth
at
the
knot
in
the
sarong
corners
you
can
come
we
drop
down
the
river
and
try
it
along
the
coast
only
chance
come
on
he
rose
and
started
for
the
door
slinging
the
bundle
over
his
shoulder
come
on
he
snarled
against
the
gay
pattern
his
handsome
pirate
face
shone
brown
and
evil
in
the
lamplight
damn
you
i
waited
long
enough
for
your
whims
stay
there
and
be
killed
then
he
ran
to
the
stairs
and
down
the
woman
arms
began
to
drag
loosely
as
if
she
were
slipping
to
the
floor
then
suddenly
with
a
cry
she
turned
and
bolted
run
as
he
might
rudolph
did
not
overtake
her
till
she
had
caught
chantel
at
the
gate
all
three
silent
sped
across
fields
toward
the
river
through
the
startling
shadows
and
dim
orange
glow
from
distant
flames
the
rough
ground
sloped
at
last
and
sent
them
stumbling
down
into
mud
behind
them
the
bank
ran
black
and
ragged
against
the
glow
before
them
still
more
black
lay
the
river
placid
mysterious
and
safe
through
the
mud
they
labored
heavily
toward
a
little
smoky
light
a
lantern
gleaming
faintly
on
a
polished
gunwale
the
shoulders
of
a
man
and
the
thin
slant
line
that
was
his
pole
lowdah
called
chantel
and
the
shoulders
moved
the
line
shifted
as
the
boatman
answered
chantel
pitched
the
bundle
over
the
lantern
and
leapt
on
board
rudolph
came
slowly
carrying
in
his
arms
the
woman
who
lay
quiet
and
limp
clasping
him
in
a
kind
of
drowsy
oblivion
he
felt
the
flutter
of
her
lips
while
she
whispered
in
his
ear
strange
breathless
entreaties
a
broken
murmur
of
endearments
which
tempted
him
more
than
the
wide
alluring
darkness
of
the
river
he
lowered
her
slowly
and
leaning
against
the
gunwale
she
still
clung
to
his
hands
aboard
quickly
snapped
their
leader
from
the
dusk
behind
the
lantern
obeying
by
impulse
rudolph
moved
nearer
the
gunwale
the
slippery
edge
polished
by
bare
feet
through
many
years
seemed
the
one
bit
of
reality
in
this
dream
except
the
warmth
of
her
hands
to
the
nunnery
he
asked
trying
dully
to
rouse
from
a
fascination
no
no
she
wailed
down
away
safe
no
back
to
them
he
answered
stupidly
they
are
all
there
your
he
is
there
we
ca
leave
you
fool
chantel
swore
in
one
tongue
and
in
another
cried
to
the
boatman
shove
off
if
they
wo
come
he
seized
the
woman
roughly
and
pulled
her
on
board
but
she
reached
out
and
caught
hand
again
come
hurry
she
whispered
tugging
at
him
come
dear
boy
i
leave
you
quickly
you
saw
it
burning
they
all
dead
it
no
use
we
must
live
we
must
live
darling
she
was
right
somehow
there
was
no
power
to
confute
her
he
must
come
with
her
or
run
back
useless
into
the
ring
of
swords
and
flames
she
and
life
were
in
the
boat
ashore
a
friend
cut
off
beyond
reach
an
impossible
duty
and
death
his
eyes
dull
and
fixed
in
the
smoky
rested
for
an
age
on
the
knotted
sarong
it
meant
nothing
then
in
a
flash
as
though
for
him
all
light
of
the
eyes
had
concentrated
in
a
single
vision
it
meant
everything
the
colored
cloth
rudely
painted
in
the
hut
of
some
forgotten
mountaineer
held
all
her
treasure
and
her
heart
the
things
of
this
world
she
must
go
with
those
it
was
fitting
she
was
beautiful
in
all
her
fear
and
disorder
still
more
beautiful
she
went
with
life
departing
into
a
dream
this
glossy
gunwale
polished
by
bare
feet
was
after
all
the
sole
reality
a
shining
line
between
life
and
death
then
i
must
die
he
groaned
and
wrenched
his
hands
away
from
that
perilous
boundary
he
vaguely
heard
her
cry
out
vaguely
saw
chantel
rise
above
the
lantern
and
slash
down
at
him
with
the
lowdah
pole
the
bamboo
struck
him
heavy
but
glancing
on
the
head
he
staggered
lost
his
footing
and
fell
into
the
mud
where
as
though
his
choice
had
already
overtaken
him
he
lay
without
thought
or
emotion
watching
the
dim
light
float
off
into
the
darkness
by
and
by
it
was
gone
from
somewhere
in
another
direction
came
a
sharp
continual
crackling
fusillade
like
the
snapping
of
dry
in
a
fire
the
unstirring
night
grew
heavier
with
the
smell
of
burnt
gunpowder
but
rudolph
sitting
in
the
mud
felt
only
that
his
eyes
were
dry
and
leaden
in
their
sockets
that
there
was
a
drumming
in
his
ears
and
that
if
heat
and
weariness
thus
made
an
end
of
him
he
need
no
longer
watch
the
oppressive
multitude
of
stars
or
hear
the
monotony
of
flowing
water
something
stirred
in
the
dry
grass
above
him
without
turning
he
heard
a
man
scramble
down
the
bank
without
looking
up
he
felt
some
one
pause
and
stoop
close
when
at
last
in
profound
apathy
he
raised
his
eyes
he
saw
against
the
starlight
the
hat
head
and
shoulders
of
a
coolie
quite
natural
he
thought
that
the
fellow
should
be
muttering
in
german
it
was
only
the
halting
rusty
fashion
of
the
speech
that
finally
fretted
him
into
listening
the
words
did
not
concern
him
are
you
dead
then
grumbled
the
coolie
did
she
kill
you
rudolph
dismissed
him
with
a
vague
but
angry
motion
some
time
afterward
the
same
voice
came
louder
the
coolie
was
still
there
you
can
not
sit
here
all
night
he
said
by
daylight
they
will
catch
you
come
perhaps
i
can
take
you
to
your
friends
come
rudolph
felt
sharp
knuckles
working
at
his
lips
and
before
he
could
rebel
found
his
mouth
full
of
sweet
fiery
liquid
he
choked
swallowed
and
presently
heard
the
empty
bottle
splash
in
the
river
said
the
rescuer
and
chuckled
something
in
dispraise
of
women
is
that
not
better
the
was
hot
and
potent
for
of
a
sudden
rudolph
found
himself
afoot
and
awake
a
dizzy
warmth
cleared
his
spirit
he
understood
perfectly
this
man
for
some
strange
reason
was
wutzler
a
coolie
and
yet
a
brother
from
the
fatherland
he
and
his
nauseous
alien
brandy
had
restored
the
future
there
was
more
to
do
come
on
the
forsaken
lover
was
first
man
up
the
bank
see
he
cried
pointing
to
a
new
flare
in
the
distance
the
whole
region
was
now
aglow
like
a
furnace
and
filled
with
smoke
with
prolonged
yells
and
a
continuity
of
explosions
that
ripped
the
night
air
like
tearing
silk
her
house
is
burning
now
you
left
in
time
wutzler
shuffled
before
him
with
the
trot
of
a
lean
and
exhausted
laborer
i
was
with
the
men
you
fought
when
you
ran
i
followed
to
the
house
and
then
here
to
the
river
i
was
glad
you
did
not
jump
on
board
he
glanced
back
timidly
for
approbation
i
am
a
great
coward
herr
heywood
told
me
so
but
i
also
stay
and
help
he
steered
craftily
among
the
longest
and
blackest
shadows
now
jogging
in
a
path
now
threading
the
boundary
of
a
or
waiting
behind
trees
and
all
the
time
though
devious
and
artful
as
a
crept
toward
the
centre
of
the
noise
and
the
leaping
flames
when
the
quaking
shadows
grew
thin
and
spare
and
the
lighted
clearings
dangerously
wide
he
swerved
to
the
right
through
a
rolling
bank
of
smoke
they
coughed
as
they
ran
once
rudolph
paused
with
the
heat
of
the
fire
on
his
cheeks
the
nunnery
is
burning
he
said
hopelessly
his
guide
halted
peered
shrewdly
and
listened
no
they
are
still
shooting
he
answered
and
limped
onward
skirting
the
uproar
at
last
when
by
pale
stars
above
the
smoke
and
flame
and
sparks
rudolph
judged
that
they
were
somewhere
north
of
the
nunnery
they
came
stumbling
down
into
a
hollow
encumbered
with
round
swollen
obstacles
like
a
patch
of
enormous
melons
lay
scattered
hide
here
and
wait
commanded
wutzler
i
will
go
see
and
he
flitted
off
through
the
smoke
smuggled
among
the
rudolph
lay
panting
shapes
of
men
ran
past
another
empty
jar
rolled
down
beside
him
and
a
stray
bullet
sang
overhead
like
a
vibrating
wire
soon
afterward
wutzler
came
crawling
through
the
huddled
pottery
lie
still
he
whispered
your
friends
are
hemmed
in
you
can
not
get
through
the
smell
of
rancid
oil
choked
them
yet
they
could
breathe
without
coughing
and
could
rest
their
smarting
eyes
in
the
midst
of
tumult
and
combustion
the
hollow
lay
dark
as
a
pool
along
its
rim
bristled
a
scrubby
fringe
of
weeds
black
against
a
rosy
cloud
after
a
time
something
still
blacker
parted
the
weeds
in
silhouette
a
man
head
his
hand
grasping
a
staff
or
the
muzzle
of
a
gun
remained
there
as
still
as
though
crawling
to
the
verge
he
lay
petrified
in
the
act
of
spying
chapter
xvii
lamp
of
heaven
the
white
men
peered
from
among
the
like
two
of
the
forty
thieves
they
could
detect
no
movement
friendly
or
hostile
the
black
head
lodged
there
without
stirring
the
watcher
whether
he
had
seen
them
or
not
was
in
no
hurry
for
with
chin
propped
among
the
weeds
he
held
a
pose
at
once
alert
and
peaceful
mischievous
and
leisurely
as
though
he
were
master
of
that
hollow
and
might
lie
all
night
drowsing
or
waking
as
the
humor
prompted
wutzler
pressed
his
face
against
the
earth
and
shivered
in
the
stifling
heat
the
uncertainty
grew
with
rudolph
into
an
acute
distress
his
legs
ached
and
twitched
the
bones
of
his
neck
were
stretched
as
if
to
break
and
a
corner
of
broken
clay
bored
sharply
between
his
ribs
he
felt
no
fear
however
only
a
great
impatience
to
have
the
spy
begin
rise
beckon
call
to
his
fellows
fire
his
gun
hit
or
miss
this
longing
or
a
flash
of
anger
or
the
working
so
nimbly
in
his
wits
gave
him
both
impulse
and
plan
do
move
he
whispered
wait
here
and
wriggling
backward
inch
by
inch
feet
foremost
among
the
crowded
bellies
of
the
jars
he
gained
the
further
darkness
so
far
as
sight
would
carry
the
head
stirred
no
more
than
if
it
had
been
a
planted
there
on
the
verge
against
the
rosy
cloud
from
crawling
rudolph
rose
to
hands
and
knees
and
silently
in
the
dust
began
to
creep
on
a
long
circuit
once
through
a
rift
in
smoke
he
saw
a
band
of
yellow
musketeers
who
crouched
behind
some
ragged
earthwork
or
broken
wall
loading
and
firing
without
pause
or
care
chattering
like
outraged
monkeys
and
all
too
busy
to
spare
a
glance
behind
their
heads
bobbed
up
and
down
in
queer
scarlet
turbans
or
scarfs
like
the
flannel
nightcaps
of
so
many
diabolic
invalids
passing
them
unseen
he
crept
back
toward
his
hollow
in
spite
of
smoke
he
had
gauged
and
held
his
circle
nicely
for
straight
ahead
lay
the
man
legs
taken
thus
in
the
rear
he
still
lay
prone
staring
down
the
slope
inactive
yet
legs
body
and
the
bent
arm
that
clutched
a
musket
beside
him
in
the
grass
were
stiff
with
some
curious
excitement
he
seemed
ready
to
spring
up
and
fire
no
time
to
lose
thought
rudolph
and
rising
measured
his
distance
with
a
painful
giddy
exactness
he
would
have
counted
to
himself
before
leaping
but
his
throat
was
too
dry
he
flinched
a
little
then
shot
through
the
air
and
landed
heavily
one
knee
on
each
side
pinning
the
fellow
down
as
he
grappled
underneath
for
the
throat
almost
in
the
same
movement
he
had
bounded
on
foot
again
holding
both
hands
above
his
head
as
high
as
he
could
withdraw
them
the
body
among
the
weeds
lay
cold
revoltingly
indifferent
to
stratagem
or
violence
in
the
same
tense
attitude
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
life
rudolph
dropped
his
hands
and
stood
confounded
by
his
own
brutal
discourtesy
wutzler
crawling
out
from
the
jars
scrambled
joyfully
up
the
bank
you
have
killed
him
quavered
the
dry
little
voice
you
are
very
brave
no
no
cried
rudolph
earnestly
he
was
already
by
the
scarlet
headgear
and
a
white
symbol
on
the
back
of
his
jacket
the
man
at
their
feet
was
one
of
the
musketeers
he
had
left
the
crawled
away
in
the
dark
and
found
a
quiet
spot
to
die
in
so
this
is
good
luck
wutzler
doffed
his
coolie
hat
slid
out
of
his
jacket
tossed
both
down
among
the
and
stooping
over
the
dead
man
began
to
untwist
the
scarlet
turban
in
the
dim
light
his
lean
arms
and
frail
body
coated
with
black
hair
gave
him
the
look
of
a
puny
ape
robbing
a
sleeper
he
wriggled
into
the
dead
man
jacket
wound
the
cloth
about
his
own
temples
and
caught
up
musket
ramrod
and
bag
of
now
i
am
all
safe
he
chuckled
now
i
can
go
anywhere
he
shouldered
arms
and
stood
grinning
as
though
all
their
troubles
were
ended
so
i
am
rebel
soldier
we
try
again
not
too
close
behind
me
and
if
i
speak
run
back
in
this
order
they
began
once
more
to
scout
through
the
smoke
no
one
met
them
though
distant
shapes
rushed
athwart
the
gloom
yelping
to
each
other
and
near
by
legs
of
runners
moved
under
a
rolling
cloud
of
smoke
as
if
their
bodies
were
embedded
and
swept
along
in
the
wrack
all
confused
hurried
and
meaningless
like
the
uproar
of
gongs
horns
conches
whistling
bullets
crackers
and
squibs
that
sputtering
string
upon
string
flower
upon
rising
flower
of
misty
red
gold
explosion
ripped
all
other
noise
to
tatters
where
and
how
he
followed
rudolph
never
could
have
told
but
once
as
they
ran
slinking
through
the
heaviest
smoke
and
as
it
seemed
the
heart
of
the
turmoil
he
recognized
the
yawning
rim
of
a
not
a
stone
throw
from
his
own
gate
it
was
amazing
to
feel
that
safety
lay
so
close
still
more
amazing
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
many
coolies
digging
in
the
pit
by
torchlight
peacefully
as
though
they
had
heard
of
no
disturbance
that
evening
hardly
had
the
picture
flashed
past
than
he
wondered
whether
he
had
seen
or
imagined
it
whose
men
they
were
and
why
even
at
any
time
they
should
swarm
so
busy
thick
as
ants
merely
to
dig
clay
he
had
worry
enough
however
to
keep
in
view
the
white
hieroglyphic
on
his
guide
jacket
suddenly
it
vanished
and
next
instant
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
jolted
against
his
ribs
run
quick
panted
wutzler
pushing
him
aside
to
the
left
into
the
here
they
are
to
your
left
and
with
the
words
he
bounded
off
to
the
right
firing
his
gun
to
confuse
the
chase
rudolph
obeyed
and
running
at
top
speed
dimly
understood
that
he
had
doubled
round
a
squad
of
grunting
runners
whose
bare
feet
pattered
close
by
him
in
the
smoke
before
him
gaped
a
black
square
through
which
he
darted
to
pitch
head
first
over
some
fat
padded
bulk
as
he
rose
the
rasping
of
rough
jute
against
his
cheek
told
him
that
he
had
fallen
among
bales
and
a
familiar
musty
smell
that
the
bales
were
his
own
in
his
own
across
a
narrow
lane
from
the
nunnery
with
high
hopes
he
stumbled
farther
into
the
darkness
once
among
the
bales
he
trod
on
a
man
hand
which
was
silently
pulled
away
with
no
time
to
think
of
that
he
crawled
and
climbed
over
the
disordered
heaps
groping
toward
the
other
door
he
had
nearly
reached
it
when
torchlight
flared
behind
him
rushing
in
and
savage
cries
both
shrill
and
guttural
rang
through
the
stuffy
warehouse
he
had
barely
time
in
the
reeling
shadows
to
fall
on
the
earthen
floor
and
crawl
under
a
thin
curtain
of
reeds
to
a
new
refuge
into
this
a
where
the
compradore
kept
his
umbrella
odds
and
ends
the
torchlight
shone
faintly
through
the
reeds
lying
flat
behind
a
roll
of
matting
rudolph
could
see
as
through
the
gauze
twilight
of
a
stage
scene
the
tossing
lights
and
the
skipping
men
who
shouted
back
and
forth
jabbing
their
spears
or
pikes
down
among
the
bales
to
probe
the
darkness
their
search
was
wild
but
thorough
before
it
in
swift
retreat
some
one
crawled
past
the
compradore
room
brushing
the
splint
partition
like
a
snake
this
as
rudolph
guessed
might
be
the
man
whose
hand
he
had
stepped
on
the
stitches
in
the
curtain
became
beads
of
light
a
shadowy
arm
heaved
up
fell
with
a
dry
ripping
sound
and
a
vertical
flash
a
sword
had
cut
the
reeds
from
top
to
bottom
through
the
rent
a
smoking
flame
plunged
after
the
sword
and
after
both
a
bony
yellow
face
that
gleamed
with
sweat
rudolph
half
wrapped
in
his
matting
could
see
the
hard
glassy
eyes
shine
cruelly
in
their
narrow
slits
but
before
they
lowered
to
meet
his
own
a
jubilant
yell
resounded
in
the
and
with
a
grunt
the
yellow
face
the
flambeau
and
the
sword
were
snatched
away
he
lay
safe
but
at
the
price
of
another
man
peril
they
had
caught
the
crawling
fugitive
and
now
came
dragging
him
back
to
the
lights
through
the
tattered
curtain
rudolph
saw
him
flung
on
the
ground
like
an
empty
sack
while
his
captors
crowded
about
in
a
broken
ring
cackling
and
prodding
him
with
their
pikes
some
jeered
some
snarled
others
called
him
by
name
with
laughing
epithets
that
rang
more
friendly
or
at
least
more
jocular
but
all
bent
toward
him
eagerly
and
flung
down
question
after
question
like
a
little
band
of
kobolds
holding
an
inquisition
at
some
sharper
cry
than
the
rest
the
fellow
rose
to
his
knees
and
faced
them
boldly
a
haggard
christian
he
was
being
fairly
given
his
last
chance
to
recant
open
your
mouth
open
your
mouth
they
cried
in
rage
or
entreaty
the
kneeling
captive
shook
his
head
and
made
some
reply
very
distinct
and
simple
open
your
mouth
they
struck
at
him
with
the
torches
the
same
sword
that
had
slashed
the
curtain
now
pricked
his
naked
chest
rudolph
clenching
his
fists
in
a
helpless
longing
to
rush
out
and
scatter
all
these
had
a
strange
sense
of
being
transported
into
the
past
to
watch
with
ghostly
impotence
a
mediaeval
tragedy
the
kneeling
man
repeated
his
unknown
declaration
his
round
honest
oily
face
was
anything
but
heroic
and
wore
no
legendary
transfiguring
light
he
seemed
rather
stupid
than
calm
yet
as
he
mechanically
wound
his
queue
into
place
once
more
above
the
shaven
forehead
his
fingers
moved
surely
and
deftly
not
once
did
they
slip
or
tremble
open
your
mouth
snarled
the
pikemen
and
the
with
the
fierce
gestures
of
men
who
have
wasted
time
and
patience
the
lamp
of
heaven
bawled
the
swordsman
beside
himself
give
him
the
lamp
of
heaven
to
the
others
this
phrase
acted
as
a
spark
to
powder
good
good
they
shrilled
nodding
furiously
the
lamp
of
heaven
and
several
men
began
to
rummage
and
overhaul
the
chaos
of
the
rudolph
had
given
orders
that
afternoon
to
remove
all
necessary
stores
to
the
nunnery
but
from
somewhere
in
the
darkness
one
rioter
brought
a
sack
of
flour
while
another
flung
down
a
tin
case
of
petroleum
the
sword
had
no
sooner
cut
the
sack
across
and
punctured
the
tin
than
a
fat
villain
in
a
loin
cloth
squatting
on
the
earthen
floor
kneaded
flour
and
oil
into
a
grimy
batch
of
dough
will
you
speak
out
and
live
cried
the
swordsman
or
will
you
die
for
a
second
the
christian
did
not
stir
then
as
though
the
option
were
not
in
his
power
die
he
answered
the
fat
baker
sprang
up
and
clapped
on
the
obstinate
head
a
shapeless
gray
turban
of
dough
half
a
dozen
torches
jostled
for
the
honor
of
lighting
it
the
christian
crowned
with
sooty
flames
gave
a
single
cry
clear
above
all
the
others
he
was
calling
as
even
rudolph
knew
on
the
strange
god
across
the
sea
saviour
of
the
children
of
the
west
not
to
forget
his
nameless
and
lonely
servant
rudolph
groaned
aloud
rose
and
had
parted
the
curtain
to
run
out
and
fall
upon
them
all
when
suddenly
close
at
hand
and
sharp
in
the
general
din
there
burst
a
quick
volley
of
rifleshots
splinters
flew
from
the
attap
walls
a
and
the
man
with
the
sword
spun
half
round
collided
and
fell
the
one
across
the
other
like
drunken
wrestlers
the
survivors
flung
down
their
torches
and
ran
leaping
and
diving
over
bales
on
the
ground
the
smouldering
lamp
of
heaven
showed
that
its
wearer
rescued
by
a
lucky
bullet
lay
still
in
a
posture
of
humility
strange
humility
it
seemed
for
one
so
suddenly
given
the
complete
and
profound
wisdom
that
confirms
all
faith
foreign
or
domestic
new
or
old
with
a
sense
of
all
this
but
no
clear
sense
of
action
rudolph
found
the
opened
it
closed
it
and
started
across
the
lane
he
knew
only
that
he
should
reach
the
mafoo
little
gate
by
the
and
step
out
of
these
dark
ages
into
the
friendly
present
so
that
when
something
from
the
wall
blazed
and
he
fell
flat
on
the
ground
he
lay
in
utter
defeat
bitterly
surprised
and
offended
his
own
friends
they
might
miss
him
once
but
not
twice
let
it
come
quickly
instead
from
the
darkness
above
came
the
most
welcome
sound
he
had
ever
known
a
keen
high
voice
scolding
what
the
devil
are
you
firing
at
it
was
heywood
somewhere
on
the
roof
of
the
he
put
the
question
sharply
yet
sounded
cool
and
cheerful
a
shadow
rot
you
waste
another
cartridge
so
and
i
take
your
gun
away
remember
that
nesbit
voice
clipped
out
some
pert
objection
potted
the
beggar
see
for
yourself
afire
saves
us
the
trouble
of
burning
it
the
other
voice
moved
away
with
a
parting
rebuke
no
more
of
that
sniping
and
squandering
wait
till
they
rush
you
rudolph
lifted
his
head
from
the
dust
maurice
he
called
feebly
maurice
let
me
in
hallo
answered
his
captain
on
the
wall
blithely
steady
on
get
you
of
all
hardships
this
brief
delay
was
least
bearable
then
a
bight
of
rope
fell
across
rudolph
back
he
seized
it
hauled
taut
and
planting
his
feet
against
the
wall
went
up
like
a
fish
to
land
gasping
on
a
row
of
ho
you
wandering
german
his
invisible
friend
clapped
him
on
the

i
glad
no
time
to
burble
now
though
off
with
you
compradore
has
a
gun
for
you
in
the
court
collect
a
drink
as
you
go
by
report
to
kneebone
at
the
northeast
corner
danger
point
there
we
need
a
good
man
so
hurry
devilish
glad
cut
along
rudolph
scrambling
down
from
the
ran
across
the
compound
with
his
head
in
a
whirl
yet
through
all
the
scudding
darkness
and
confusion
one
fact
had
pierced
as
bright
as
a
star
on
this
night
of
alarms
he
had
turned
the
great
corner
in
his
life
like
the
pale
stranger
with
his
crown
of
fire
he
could
finish
the
course
he
caught
his
rifle
from
the
compradore
hand
but
needed
no
draught
from
any
earthly
cup
brushing
through
the
orange
trees
he
made
for
the
northeast
angle
free
of
all
longing
perplexities
purged
of
all
vile
admiration
and
fit
to
join
his
friends
in
clean
and
wholesome
danger
chapter
xviii
siege
he
never
believed
that
they
could
hold
the
northeast
corner
for
a
minute
so
loud
and
unceasing
was
the
uproar
bullets
spattered
sharply
along
the
wall
and
sang
overhead
mixed
now
and
then
with
an
indescribable
whistling
and
jingling
the
angle
was
like
the
prow
of
a
ship
cutting
forward
into
a
gale
yet
rudolph
climbed
rejoicing
up
the
short
bamboo
ladder
to
the
platform
which
his
coolies
had
built
in
such
haste
so
long
ago
that
afternoon
his
high
spirits
went
before
a
fall
as
he
stood
up
in
the
full
glow
from
the
burning
somebody
tackled
him
about
the
knees
and
threw
him
head
first
on
the
how
many
times
must
i
give
me
orders
barked
the
little
under
cover
under
cover
and
stay
under
cover
or
i
send
ye
below
ye
gallivanting
oh
it
you
is
it
well
there
your
a
stubby
finger
pointed
in
the
obscurity
there
and
do
ye
fire
till
i
say
so
thus
made
welcome
rudolph
crawled
toward
a
chink
among
the
bags
ran
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
into
place
and
lay
ready
for
whatever
might
come
out
of
the
quaking
lights
and
darknesses
beyond
nothing
came
however
except
a
swollen
continuity
of
sound
a
rolling
cloud
of
noises
thick
and
sullen
as
the
smell
of
burnt
gunpowder
it
was
strange
thought
rudolph
how
nothing
happened
from
moment
to
moment
no
yellow
bodies
came
charging
out
of
the
hubbub
he
himself
lay
there
unhurt
his
fellows
joked
grumbled
shifted
their
legs
on
the
platform
at
times
the
heavier
duller
sound
which
had
been
the
signal
for
the
whole
disorder
one
ponderous
beat
as
on
a
huge
and
very
slack
told
that
the
black
dog
from
rotterdam
was
not
far
off
yet
even
then
there
followed
no
shock
of
battering
at
masonry
but
only
an
access
of
the
stormy
whistling
and
jingling
copper
cash
declared
the
voice
of
heywood
in
a
lull
by
the
sound
he
was
standing
on
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
with
his
head
at
the
level
of
the
platform
also
by
the
sound
he
was
enjoying
himself
inordinately
what
a
jolly
good
piece
of
luck
scrap
metal
and
copper
cash
firing
money
at
us
like
you
captain
just
what
we
thought
too
some
unruly
gang
among
them
would
wait
and
forced
matters
tonight
was
premature
the
beggars
have
plenty
of
powder
and
little
else
so
far
rudolph
listened
in
wonder
here
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
was
a
busy
commander
drawing
conclusions
and
extracting
news
from
chaos
look
out
for
arrows
continued
the
speaker
as
he
crawled
to
a
loophole
between
rudolph
and
the
captain
they
shooting
arrows
up
over
killed
one
convert
and
wounded
two
there
by
the
water
gate
they
ca
get
the
elevation
for
you
chaps
here
though
and
again
he
added
cheerfully
so
far
at
least
the
little
band
behind
the
loopholes
lay
watching
through
the
smoke
listening
through
the
noise
the
black
dog
barked
again
and
sent
a
shower
of
money
clinking
along
the
wall
how
do
you
like
it
rudie
chuckled
his
friend
it
is
terrible
answered
rudolph
honestly
terrible
racket
yes
fireworks
to
frighten
us
wait
till
their
ammunition
comes
then
you
see
fun
fireworks
all
this
heywood
turned
to
his
other
companion
i
say
kneebone
what
your
idea
sniping
all
night
will
it
be
or
shall
we
get
a
fair
chance
at
the
captain
a
small
white
recumbent
spectre
lifted
his
head
and
appeared
to
sniff
the
smoke
judicially
they
get
a
chance
at
us
more
like
he
grumbled
my
opinion
the
blighters
have
shot
and
burnt
themselves
into
a
state
o
mind
delusion
o
grandeur
that
what
wildest
of
will
rush
us
once
maybe
twice
we
stave
off
say
that
case
they
settle
down
to
starve
us
right
and
proper
siege
assented
heywood
siege
like
you
read
about
the
captain
lay
flat
again
wish
a
man
could
smoke
up
here
heywood
laughed
and
turned
his
head
how
much
do
you
know
about
sieges
old
chap
nothing
rudolph
confessed
nor
i
worse
luck
outside
of
school
facia
that
sort
of
thing
however
he
went
on
cheerfully
we
shall
before
long
he
broke
off
with
a
start
rudie
by
jove
i
forgot
did
you
find
them
bertha
forrester
gone
said
rudolph
and
struggling
to
explain
found
his
late
adventure
shrunk
into
the
compass
of
a
few
words
far
too
small
and
bare
to
suggest
the
magnitude
of
his
decision
they
went
he
began
in
a
boat
he
was
saved
the
trouble
for
suddenly
captain
kneebone
cried
in
a
voice
of
keen
satisfaction
here
they
come
i
told
ye
and
fired
his
rifle
through
a
patch
of
firelight
down
the
gentle
slope
of
the
field
swept
a
ragged
cohort
of
men
some
some
in
their
scarlet
nightcaps
as
though
they
had
escaped
from
bed
and
all
yelling
one
of
the
foremost
who
met
the
captain
bullet
was
carried
stumbling
his
own
length
before
he
sank
underfoot
as
the
mausers
flashed
from
between
the
another
and
another
man
fell
to
his
knees
or
toppled
sidelong
tripping
his
fellows
into
a
little
knot
or
windrow
of
kicking
arms
and
legs
but
the
main
wave
poured
on
all
the
faster
among
and
above
them
like
wreckage
in
that
surf
tossed
the
shapes
of
and
notched
bamboos
two
naked
men
swinging
between
them
a
long
cylinder
or
log
flashed
through
the
bonfire
space
and
on
into
the
dark
below
the
wall
bawled
the
captain
look
out
for
the
his
friends
were
too
busy
firing
into
the
crowded
gloom
below
rudolph
fumbling
at
and
pulling
trigger
felt
the
end
of
a
ladder
bump
his
forehead
saw
turban
and
mediaeval
halberd
heave
above
him
and
without
time
to
think
of
firing
dashed
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
at
the
climber
face
the
shock
was
solid
the
halberd
rang
on
the
platform
but
the
man
vanished
like
a
shade
very
neat
growled
heywood
who
in
the
same
instant
with
a
great
shove
managed
to
fling
down
the
ladder
perfectly
silly
attack
hold
while
he
spoke
however
something
hurtled
over
their
heads
and
thumped
the
platform
the
queer
log
or
cylinder
lay
there
with
a
red
coal
sputtering
at
one
end
a
burning
fuse
heywood
snatched
at
it
and
missed
some
one
else
caught
up
the
long
bulk
and
springing
to
his
feet
swung
it
aloft
firelight
showed
the
bristling
moustache
of
kempner
his
long
thin
arms
poising
a
great
bamboo
case
bound
with
rings
of
leather
or
metal
he
threw
it
out
with
his
utmost
force
staggered
as
though
to
follow
it
then
leaping
back
straightened
his
tall
body
with
a
jerk
flung
out
one
arm
in
a
gesture
of
surprise
no
sooner
rigid
than
drooping
and
even
while
he
seemed
inflated
for
another
of
his
speeches
turned
and
dove
into
the
garden
and
the
night
by
the
ending
of
it
he
had
redeemed
a
somewhat
rancid
life
before
the
angle
was
alive
with
swarming
heads
as
he
fell
it
was
empty
and
the
assault
finished
for
below
the
bamboo
tube
burst
with
a
sound
that
shook
the
wall
liquid
flame
the
greek
fire
of
chemicals
squirted
in
jets
that
revealed
a
crowd
torn
asunder
saffron
faces
contorted
in
shouting
and
men
who
leapt
away
with
clothes
afire
and
bursting
at
their
sides
dim
figures
scampered
off
up
the
rising
ground
that
over
panted
heywood
thundering
good
lesson
here
count
noses
rudie
sturgeon
teppich
padre
captain
good
but
look
sharp
while
i
go
inspect
he
whispered
to
rudolph
come
down
wo
you
and
help
me
with
you
know
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
they
met
a
man
in
white
with
a
white
face
in
what
might
be
the
dawn
or
the
pallor
of
the
moon
is
hackh
there
he
hailed
them
in
a
dry
voice
and
cleared
his
throat
where
is
she
where
my
wife
it
was
here
accordingly
while
heywood
stooped
over
a
tumbled
object
on
the
ground
that
rudolph
told
her
husband
what
bertha
forrester
had
chosen
the
words
came
harder
than
before
but
at
last
he
got
rid
of
them
his
questioner
stood
very
still
it
was
like
telling
the
news
of
an
absent
ghost
to
another
present
this
town
was
never
a
place
said
gilly
with
all
his
former
steadiness
never
a
place
to
bring
a
woman
and
and
of
her
age
all
three
men
listened
to
the
conflict
of
gongs
and
crackers
and
to
the
shouting
now
muffled
and
distant
behind
the
knoll
all
three
as
it
seemed
to
rudolph
had
consented
to
ignore
something
vile
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
said
the
older
man
slowly
i
must
get
back
to
my
post
you
did
say
but
she
made
no
attempt
to
come
here
well
that
that
lucky
i
go
back
for
some
time
again
they
stood
as
though
listening
till
heywood
spoke
holding
your
own
are
you
by
the
water
gate
oh
yes
replied
forrester
rousing
slightly
all
quiet
there
no
more
arrows
converts
behaving
splendidly
two
or
three
have
begged
for
guns
give
this
heywood
skipped
up
the
ladder
to
return
with
a
rifle
and
this
belt
kempner
poor
chap
he
never
ask
you
to
return
anything
else
no
answered
gilly
taking
the
dead
man
weapon
and
moving
off
into
the
darkness
no
except
he
halted
except
if
we
come
to
a
pinch
and
need
a
man
for
some
tight
place
then
give
me
first
chance
you
i
could
do
better
now
than
than
you
younger
men
oh
and
hackh
your
efforts
well
few
men
would
have
dared
and
i
feel
immensely
grateful
he
disappeared
among
the
orange
trees
leaving
rudolph
to
think
about
such
gratitude
now
then
called
heywood
and
stooped
to
the
white
bundle
at
their
feet
do
stand
looking
ca
be
helped
trust
old
gilly
to
take
it
like
a
man
come
bear
a
hand
and
between
them
the
two
friends
carried
to
the
nunnery
a
tiresome
theorist
who
had
acted
once
and
now
himself
tired
and
limp
would
offend
no
more
by
speaking
when
the
dawn
filled
the
compound
with
a
deep
blue
twilight
and
this
in
turn
grew
pale
the
menace
of
noise
gradually
faded
also
like
an
orgy
of
evil
spirits
dispersing
before
cockcrow
to
ears
long
deafened
the
wide
stillness
had
the
effect
of
another
sound
never
heard
before
even
when
disturbed
by
the
flutter
of
birds
darting
from
top
to
dense
green
top
of
the
orange
trees
the
air
seemed
hushed
by
some
unholy
constraint
through
the
cool
morning
vapors
hot
smoke
from
smouldering
wreckage
mounted
thin
and
straight
toward
where
the
pale
disk
of
the
moon
dissolved
in
light
the
convex
field
stood
bare
except
for
a
few
overthrown
scarecrows
in
naked
yellow
or
dusty
blue
and
for
a
jagged
strip
of
earthwork
torn
from
the
crest
over
which
the
black
dog
thrust
his
round
muzzle
in
a
truce
of
empty
silence
the
defenders
slept
by
turns
among
the
the
day
came
and
dragged
by
without
incident
the
sun
blazed
in
the
compound
swinging
overhead
and
slanting
down
through
the
afternoon
at
the
water
gate
rudolph
heywood
and
the
padre
with
a
few
forlorn
christians
driven
in
like
sheep
at
the
last
moment
were
building
a
rough
screen
against
the
arrows
that
had
flown
in
darkness
and
that
now
lay
scattered
along
the
path
one
of
these
a
workman
suddenly
caught
at
and
with
a
grunt
held
up
before
the
padre
the
head
was
blunt
about
the
shaft
wound
tightly
with
silk
thread
ran
a
thin
roll
of
chinese
paper
earle
nodded
took
the
arrow
and
slitting
with
a
freed
and
flattened
out
a
painted
scroll
of
complex
characters
his
keen
old
eyes
ran
down
the
columns
his
face
always
cloudy
now
grew
darker
with
perplexity
a
message
he
declared
slowly
i
think
a
serious
message
he
sat
down
on
a
pile
of
sacks
and
spread
the
paper
on
his
knee
but
the
characters
are
so
elaborate
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
he
beckoned
heywood
and
together
they
scowled
at
the
intricate
and
meaningless
symbols
all
alike
complained
the
younger
man
maddening
then
his
face
lighted
no
see
here
lower
left
hand
the
last
stroke
of
the
brush
down
in
the
corner
formed
a
loose
from
wutzler
must
mean
something
for
all
that
the
painted
lines
remained
a
stubborn
puzzle
something
yes
but
what
the
padre
pulled
out
a
cigar
and
smoking
at
top
speed
spaced
off
each
character
with
his
thumb
they
are
all
alike
and
yet
he
clutched
his
white
hair
with
big
knuckles
and
tugged
replaced
his
mushroom
helmet
held
the
paper
at
a
new
focus
ah
he
said
doubtfully
and
at
last
yes
for
some
time
he
read
to
himself
nodding
a
triad
cipher
well
resumed
heywood
patiently
the
reader
pointed
with
his
cigar
take
only
the
left
half
of
that
word
and
what
have
you
read
heywood
the
right
half
take
the
padre
ordered
this
one
left
half
repeated
his
pupil
the
right
half
might
be
but
that
nonsense
no
said
the
padre
you
have
the
secret
it
good
triad
writing
subtract
this
twisted
character
from
each
and
we
made
the
crooked
straight
the
writer
was
afraid
of
being
caught
here
the
sense
of
his
message
i
take
it
and
he
read
off
slowly
a
hakka
boat
on
opposite
shore
a
green
flag
and
a
hoisted
at
her
mast
light
a
fire
on
the
steps
and
she
will
come
quickly
day
or
heywood
took
the
news
coldly
he
shook
his
head
and
stood
thinking
that
wo
help
he
said
curtly
never
in
the
world
with
the
aid
of
a
convert
he
unbarred
the
ponderous
gate
and
ventured
out
on
the
highest
slab
of
the
across
the
river
to
be
sure
there
lay
between
a
local
junk
and
a
stray
from
the
north
the
hakka
boat
her
deck
roofed
with
tawny
and
at
her
masthead
a
wooden
dangling
below
a
green
rag
aft
by
the
great
perched
a
man
motionless
yet
seeming
to
watch
heywood
turned
however
and
pointed
downstream
to
where
at
the
bend
of
the
river
a
little
spit
of
mud
ran
out
from
the
marsh
on
the
spit
from
among
tussocks
a
man
in
a
round
hat
sprang
up
like
a
thin
black
toadstool
he
waved
an
arm
and
gave
a
shrill
cry
summoning
help
from
further
inland
other
hats
presently
came
bobbing
toward
him
low
down
among
the
marsh
puffs
of
white
spurted
out
from
the
mud
and
as
heywood
dodged
back
through
the
gate
and
nesbit
rifle
answered
from
his
little
fort
on
the
the
distant
crack
of
the
muskets
joined
with
a
spattering
of
ooze
and
a
chipping
of
stone
on
the
covered
you
see
said
heywood
replacing
the
bar
last
resort
perhaps
that
way
still
we
may
as
well
keep
a
bundle
of
firewood
ready
here
the
shots
from
the
marsh
though
trivial
and
scattering
were
like
a
signal
for
all
about
the
nunnery
from
a
ring
of
the
noise
of
last
night
broke
out
afresh
the
sun
lowered
through
a
brown
burnt
haze
the
night
sped
up
from
the
ocean
covering
the
sky
with
sudden
darkness
in
which
stars
appeared
many
and
cool
above
the
torrid
earth
and
the
insensate
turmoil
so
without
change
but
from
pause
to
outbreak
outbreak
to
pause
nights
and
days
went
by
in
the
siege
nothing
happened
one
morning
indeed
the
fragments
of
another
blunt
arrow
came
to
light
broken
underfoot
and
trampled
into
the
dust
the
paper
scroll
in
tatters
held
only
a
few
marks
legible
through
dirt
and
listen
work
fast
many
bags
watch
closely
and
still
nothing
happened
to
explain
the
warning
that
night
heywood
even
made
a
sortie
and
stealing
from
the
main
gate
with
four
coolies
removed
to
the
river
certain
relics
that
lay
close
under
the
wall
and
would
soon
become
intolerable
he
had
returned
safely
with
an
ancient
musket
a
bag
of
bullets
a
petroleum
squirt
and
a
small
bundle
of
and
was
making
his
tour
of
the
defenses
when
he
stumbled
over
rudolph
who
knelt
on
the
ground
under
what
in
old
days
had
been
the
chapel
and
near
what
now
was
kempner
grave
he
was
not
kneeling
in
devotion
for
he
took
heywood
by
the
arm
and
made
him
stoop
i
was
coming
he
said
to
find
you
the
first
night
i
saw
coolies
working
in
the
bend
a
moment
over
put
now
the
ear
close
heywood
laid
his
cheek
in
the
dust
they
keeping
such
a
racket
outside
he
muttered
and
then
half
to
himself
it
certainly
is
rudie
it
it
as
if
poor
kempner
were
waking
up
he
listened
again
you
right
they
are
digging
the
two
friends
sat
up
and
eyed
each
other
in
the
starlight
chapter
xix
brother
moles
this
new
danger
working
below
in
the
solid
earth
had
thrown
rudolph
into
a
state
of
sullen
resignation
what
was
the
use
now
he
thought
indignantly
of
all
their
watching
and
fighting
the
ground
at
any
moment
might
heave
break
and
spring
up
underfoot
he
waited
for
his
friend
to
speak
out
and
put
the
same
thought
roundly
into
words
instead
to
his
surprise
he
heard
something
quite
contrary
now
we
know
said
heywood
in
lively
satisfaction
now
we
know
what
the
beasts
have
up
their
sleeve
that
a
comfort
rather
he
sat
thinking
a
white
figure
in
the
starlight
like
a
buddha
that
why
they
all
been
lying
doggo
he
continued
and
then
their
bad
marksmanship
with
all
this
sniping
they
do
care
you
see
whether
they
pot
us
or
not
they
rather
make
one
clean
sweep
and
us
at
the
moon
eh
cheer
up
rudie
so
long
as
they
digging
they
not
blowing
are
they
while
he
spoke
the
din
outside
the
walls
wavered
and
sank
at
last
giving
place
to
a
shrill
tiny
interlude
of
insect
voices
in
this
diluted
silence
came
now
and
then
a
tinkle
of
glass
from
the
dark
hospital
room
where
miss
drake
was
groping
among
her
vials
heywood
listened
if
it
were
for
that
he
said
quietly
i
should
much
care
except
for
the
women
this
would
really
be
great
larks
then
as
a
shadow
flitted
past
the
orange
grove
he
roused
himself
to
hail
ah
pat
go
catchee
four
piecee
can
do
the
shadow
passed
and
after
a
time
returned
with
four
other
shadows
they
stood
waiting
till
heywood
raised
his
head
from
the
dust
those
noises
have
stopped
down
there
he
said
to
rudolph
and
rising
gave
his
orders
briefly
the
coolies
were
to
dig
strike
into
the
sappers
tunnel
and
report
at
once
meantime
rudie
take
a
holiday
we
can
smoke
in
the
courtyard
a
solitary
candle
burned
in
the
far
corner
of
the
inclosure
and
cast
faint
streamers
of
reflection
along
the
wet
flags
which
sluiced
with
water
from
the
well
exhaled
a
slight
but
grateful
coolness
heywood
stooped
above
the
quivering
flame
lighted
a
cigar
and
sinking
loosely
into
a
chair
blew
the
smoke
upward
in
slow
content
luxury
he
yawned
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
fret
about
till
the
compradore
reports
wonderful
too
good
to
be
true
for
a
long
time
lying
side
by
side
they
might
have
been
asleep
through
the
dim
light
on
the
white
walls
dipped
and
swerved
the
drunken
shadow
of
a
bat
who
now
whirled
as
a
flake
of
blackness
across
the
stars
now
swooped
and
set
the
humbler
flame
reeling
the
flutter
of
his
leathern
wings
and
the
plash
of
water
in
the
dark
where
a
coolie
still
drenched
the
flags
marked
the
sleepy
soothing
measures
in
a
nocturne
broken
at
strangely
regular
intervals
by
a
shot
and
the
crack
of
a
bullet
somewhere
above
in
the
deserted
chambers
queer
mused
heywood
drowsily
studying
his
watch
the
beggar
puts
one
shot
every
five
minutes
through
the
same
i
wonder
what
thinking
about
lying
out
there
firing
at
the
ghosts
odd
wonder
what
they
all
he
put
back
his
cigar
mumbling
handful
of
poor
blackguards
all
upset
in
their
minds
and
sweating
round
and
all
the
rest
tranquil
as
ever
eh
the
whole
country
jogging
on
the
same
old
way
or
asleep
and
dreaming
dreams
perhaps
same
kind
of
dreams
they
had
in
marco
polo
day
the
end
of
his
cigar
burned
red
again
and
again
except
for
that
he
might
have
been
asleep
rudolph
made
no
answer
but
lay
thinking
this
brief
moment
of
rest
in
the
cool
dim
courtyard
merely
to
lie
there
and
wait
seemed
precious
above
all
other
gain
or
knowledge
some
quiet
influence
a
subtle
and
profound
conviction
slowly
was
at
work
in
him
it
was
patience
wonder
steady
confidence
all
three
and
more
he
had
felt
it
but
this
once
obscurely
might
die
without
knowing
it
in
clearer
fashion
and
yet
could
never
lose
it
or
forget
or
come
to
any
later
harm
with
it
the
stars
above
the
dim
vagaries
of
the
bat
were
brightly
interwoven
for
the
present
he
had
only
to
lie
ready
and
wait
a
single
comrade
in
a
happy
army
through
a
dark
little
door
came
miss
drake
all
in
white
and
moving
quietly
like
a
symbolic
figure
of
evening
or
the
genius
of
the
place
her
hair
shone
duskily
as
she
bent
beside
the
candle
and
with
steady
fingers
tilted
a
vial
from
which
amber
drops
fell
slowly
into
a
glass
with
dark
eyes
watching
closely
she
had
the
air
of
a
young
beneficent
medea
intent
on
some
white
magic
are
you
coming
called
heywood
to
sit
with
us
awhile
ca
thanks
she
replied
without
looking
up
i
too
busy
that
no
excuse
rest
a
little
she
moved
away
carrying
her
medicines
but
paused
in
the
door
smiled
back
at
him
as
from
a
crypt
and
said
have
been
hurt
only
my
feelings
i
no
time
she
laughed
for
lazy
persons
and
she
was
gone
in
the
darkness
to
sit
by
her
wounded
men
with
her
went
the
interval
of
peace
for
past
the
came
another
figure
scuffing
slowly
toward
the
light
the
compradore
his
robes
lost
in
their
background
appeared
as
an
oily
face
and
a
hand
beckoning
with
downward
sweep
the
two
friends
rose
and
followed
him
down
the
courtyard
in
passing
out
they
discovered
the
padre
wife
lying
exhausted
in
a
low
chair
of
which
she
filled
half
the
length
and
all
the
width
heywood
paused
beside
her
with
some
friendly
question
to
which
rudolph
caught
the
answer
oh
quite
composed
her
voice
sounded
fretful
her
fan
stirred
weakly
yes
wonderfully
composed
i
feel
quite
ready
to
suffer
for
the
faith
dear
earle
said
the
young
man
gently
there
ought
to
be
no
need
nobody
shall
suffer
if
we
can
prevent
i
think
we
can
under
the
orange
trees
he
laid
an
unsteady
hand
on
rudolph
arm
and
halting
shook
with
quiet
merriment
poor
dear
lady
he
whispered
and
went
forward
chuckling
loose
earth
underfoot
warned
them
not
to
stumble
over
the
mound
beside
the
pit
which
yawned
slightly
blacker
than
the
night
kempner
grave
had
not
been
quieter
the
compradore
stood
whispering
they
had
found
the
tunnel
empty
because
he
thought
the
sappers
were
gone
out
to
eat
their
chow
we
see
anyway
said
heywood
stripping
off
his
coat
he
climbed
over
the
mound
grasped
the
edges
and
promptly
disappeared
in
the
long
moment
which
followed
the
earth
might
have
closed
on
him
once
as
rudolph
bent
listening
over
the
shaft
there
seemed
to
come
a
faint
momentary
gleam
but
no
sound
and
no
further
sign
until
the
head
and
shoulders
burrowed
up
again
big
enough
hole
down
there
he
reported
swinging
clear
and
sitting
with
his
feet
in
the
shaft
regular
cave
three
sacks
of
powder
stowed
already
so
we
none
too
one
sack
was
leaky
i
struck
a
match
and
nearly
blew
myself
to
casabianca
he
paused
as
if
reflecting
it
gives
us
a
plan
though
rudie
are
you
game
for
something
rather
foolhardy
be
frank
now
for
if
you
would
really
enjoy
it
i
give
old
gilly
forrester
his
chance
no
said
rudolph
stung
as
by
some
perfidy
you
make
me
ashamed
this
is
all
ours
this
part
so
can
do
laughed
the
other
get
off
your
jacket
give
me
half
a
moment
start
so
that
you
wo
jump
on
my
head
and
he
went
wriggling
down
into
the
pit
an
unwholesome
smell
of
wet
earth
a
damp
subterranean
coolness
enveloped
rudolph
as
he
slid
down
a
flue
of
greasy
clay
and
stooping
crawled
into
the
horizontal
bore
of
the
tunnel
large
enough
perhaps
for
two
or
three
men
to
pass
on
all
fours
it
ran
level
roughly
cut
through
earth
wet
with
seepage
from
the
river
but
packed
into
a
smooth
floor
by
many
hands
and
bare
knees
it
widened
suddenly
before
him
in
the
small
chamber
of
the
mine
choked
with
the
smell
of
stale
betel
he
bumped
heywood
elbow
some
fragrant
ones
have
been
working
here
i
should
say
the
speaker
patted
the
ground
with
quick
palms
groping
phew
they
worked
like
steam
this
explains
old
wutz
and
his
broken
arrow
i
say
rudie
feel
about
i
saw
a
coil
of
fuse
lying
at
least
i
thought
it
was
ah
never
mind
he
pulled
something
along
the
floor
how
the
old
forearm
i
gave
you
i
forgot
that
equal
to
hauling
a
sack
out
good
catch
hold
here
sweeping
his
hand
in
the
darkness
he
captured
rudolph
and
guided
it
to
where
a
lay
now
then
carry
on
he
commanded
and
crawling
into
the
tunnel
flung
back
fragments
of
explanation
as
he
tugged
at
his
own
load
carry
these
out
far
as
we
dare
touch
off
you
see
and
block
the
passage
far
out
as
possible
though
we
can
use
this
hole
afterward
for
listening
in
if
they
try
he
cut
the
sentence
short
their
tunnel
had
begun
to
slope
gently
downward
with
niches
gouged
here
and
there
for
the
passing
of
rudolph
toiling
after
suddenly
found
his
head
entangled
between
his
leader
boots
quiet
he
heard
him
whisper
somebody
coming
an
instant
later
the
boots
withdrew
quickly
an
odd
little
squeak
of
surprise
followed
a
strange
gurgling
and
a
succession
of
rapid
shocks
as
though
some
one
were
pummeling
the
earthen
walls
got
the
beggar
panted
heywood
only
one
of
roll
clear
rudie
and
let
us
pass
collar
his
legs
if
you
can
and
shove
squeezing
past
rudolph
in
his
niche
there
struggled
a
convulsive
bulk
like
some
monstrous
worm
too
large
for
the
bore
yet
writhing
bare
feet
kicked
him
in
violent
rebellion
and
a
muscular
knee
jarred
squarely
under
his
chin
he
caught
a
pair
of
naked
legs
and
hugged
them
dearly
not
too
hard
called
heywood
with
a
breathless
laugh
poor
devil
must
think
he
ran
foul
of
a
genie
indeed
their
prisoner
had
already
given
up
the
conflict
and
lay
under
them
with
limbs
dissolved
and
quaking
pass
him
along
chuckled
his
captor
make
him
go
ahead
of
us
prodded
into
action
the
man
stirred
limply
and
crawled
past
them
toward
the
mine
while
heywood
at
his
heels
growled
orders
in
the
vernacular
with
a
voice
of
dismal
ferocity
in
this
order
they
gained
the
shaft
and
wriggled
up
like
ferrets
into
the
night
air
rudolph
standing
as
in
a
well
heard
a
volley
of
questions
and
a
few
timid
answers
before
the
returning
legs
of
his
comrade
warned
him
to
dodge
back
into
the
tunnel
again
the
two
men
crept
forward
on
their
expedition
and
this
time
the
leader
talked
without
lowering
his
voice
that
chap
he
declared
was
fairly
chattering
with
fright
coolie
it
seems
who
came
back
to
find
his
the
rest
are
all
outside
eating
their
rice
we
have
a
clear
track
they
stumbled
on
their
caught
hold
and
dragged
them
at
first
easily
down
the
incline
then
over
a
short
level
then
arduously
up
a
rising
grade
till
the
work
grew
heavy
and
hot
and
breath
came
hard
in
the
stifled
burrow
far
enough
said
heywood
puffing
pile
yours
here
rudolph
however
was
not
only
drenched
with
sweat
but
fired
by
a
new
spirit
a
spirit
of
daring
he
would
try
down
here
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
to
emulate
his
friend
but
let
us
reconnoitre
he
objected
it
will
bring
us
to
the
where
i
saw
them
digging
let
us
go
out
to
the
end
and
look
well
said
old
mole
heywood
snapped
his
fingers
with
delight
i
never
thought
of
that
by
his
tone
he
was
proud
of
the
amendment
come
on
by
all
means
i
say
i
did
really
i
did
poor
old
gilly
down
here
you
know
they
crawled
on
with
more
speed
but
no
less
caution
up
the
strait
little
gallery
which
now
rose
between
smooth
soft
walls
of
clay
suddenly
as
the
incline
once
more
became
a
level
they
saw
a
glimmering
square
of
dusky
red
like
the
fluttering
of
a
weak
flame
through
scarlet
cloth
this
while
they
shuffled
toward
it
grew
higher
and
broader
until
they
lay
prone
in
the
very
door
of
the
hill
a
large
portal
deeply
overhung
by
the
edge
of
the
and
flanked
with
what
seemed
a
bulkhead
of
piled
in
orderly
tiers
between
shadowy
mounds
of
loose
earth
flickered
the
light
of
a
fire
small
and
distant
round
which
wavered
the
inky
silhouettes
of
men
and
beyond
which
dimly
shone
a
yellow
face
or
two
a
yellow
fist
clutched
full
of
boiled
rice
like
a
snowball
beyond
these
in
turn
gleamed
other
little
fires
where
other
coolies
were
squatting
at
their
supper
rudie
look
heywood
voice
trembled
with
joyful
excitement
look
these
bags
not
at
all
it
powder
old
chap
powder
their
whole
supply
wait
a
bit
oh
by
jove
wait
a
bit
he
scurried
back
into
the
hill
like
a
great
rat
returned
as
quickly
and
swiftly
and
with
eager
hands
began
to
uncoil
something
on
the
clay
threshold
do
you
know
enough
to
time
a
fuse
he
whispered
neither
do
powder
bad
anyhow
we
must
guess
at
it
here
quick
lend
me
a
knife
he
slashed
open
one
of
the
lower
sacks
in
the
bulkhead
by
the
door
stuffed
in
some
kind
of
twisted
cord
and
edging
away
sat
for
an
instant
with
his
gleaming
in
the
ruddy
twilight
how
long
rudie
how
long
he
smothered
a
groan
too
long
or
too
short
spoils
everything
oh
well
here
goes
the
blade
moved
now
lie
across
he
ordered
and
shield
the
tandstickor
with
a
sudden
fuff
the
match
blazed
up
to
show
his
gray
eyes
bright
and
dancing
his
face
glossy
with
sweat
below
on
the
golden
clay
the
twisted
lumpy
tail
of
the
fuse
like
the
end
of
a
dusty
vine
darkness
followed
quick
and
blinding
a
rosy
fitful
coal
sputtered
darting
out
short
capillary
lines
and
needles
of
fire
cut
sticks
go
like
the
devil
if
it
blows
up
and
caves
the
earth
on
us
heywood
ran
on
hands
and
knees
as
if
that
were
his
natural
way
of
going
rudolph
scrambled
after
now
urged
by
an
ecstasy
of
apprehension
now
clogged
as
by
the
weight
of
all
the
hill
above
them
if
it
should
fall
now
he
thought
or
now
and
thus
measuring
as
he
crawled
found
the
tunnel
endless
when
at
last
however
they
gained
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
and
were
hoisted
out
among
their
coolies
on
the
shelving
mound
the
evening
stillness
lay
above
and
about
them
undisturbed
the
fuse
could
never
have
lasted
all
these
minutes
their
whole
enterprise
was
but
labor
lost
they
listened
breathing
short
no
sound
came
gone
out
said
heywood
gloomily
or
else
they
saw
it
he
climbed
the
bamboo
scaffold
and
stood
looking
over
the
wall
rudolph
perched
beside
him
by
the
same
anxious
futile
instinct
of
curiosity
for
they
could
see
nothing
but
the
night
and
the
burning
stars
gone
out
underground
again
rudie
and
try
our
first
plan
heywood
turned
to
leap
down
the
looks
to
set
off
his
mine
morning
he
clutched
the
wall
in
time
to
save
himself
as
the
bamboo
frame
leapt
underfoot
outside
the
crest
of
the
slope
ran
black
against
a
single
burst
of
flame
the
detonation
came
like
the
blow
of
a
mallet
on
the
ribs
let
him
look
let
him
look
heywood
jumped
to
the
ground
and
in
a
pelting
shower
of
clods
exulted
he
looked
again
and
saw
it
was
the
middle
of
next
week
come
on
brother
mole
spread
the
news
he
ran
off
laughing
in
the
wide
hush
of
astonishment
chapter
xx
the
hakka
boat
pretty
fair
captain
kneebone
said
but
that
ai
the
end
this
grudging
praise
in
which
moreover
heywood
tamely
acquiesced
was
his
only
comment
on
rudolph
it
had
singular
effects
at
first
filling
him
with
resentment
and
almost
making
him
suspect
the
little
captain
of
jealousy
then
amusing
him
as
chance
words
of
no
weight
but
in
the
unreal
days
that
followed
recurring
to
convince
him
with
all
the
force
of
prompt
and
subtle
it
helped
him
to
learn
the
cold
salutary
lesson
that
one
exploit
does
not
make
a
victory
the
springing
of
their
countermine
he
found
was
no
deliverance
it
had
two
plain
results
and
no
more
the
crest
of
the
high
field
without
had
changed
its
contour
next
morning
as
though
a
monster
had
bitten
it
and
when
the
day
had
burnt
itself
out
in
sullen
darkness
there
burst
on
all
sides
an
attack
of
prolonged
and
furious
exasperation
the
fusillade
now
came
not
only
from
the
landward
sides
but
from
a
long
flotilla
of
boats
in
the
river
and
although
these
vanished
at
dawn
the
fire
never
slackened
either
from
above
the
field
or
from
a
distant
wall
newly
spotted
with
loopholes
beyond
the
ashes
of
the
on
the
night
following
the
boats
crept
closer
and
suddenly
both
gates
resounded
with
the
blows
of
these
and
later
assaults
were
beaten
off
by
daylight
the
nunnery
walls
were
pitted
as
with
yet
the
little
company
remained
untouched
except
for
teppich
whose
shaven
head
was
trimmed
still
closer
and
redder
by
a
bullet
and
for
gilbert
forrester
who
showed
with
the
grave
smile
of
a
man
when
fates
are
playful
two
shots
through
his
loose
jacket
he
was
the
only
man
to
smile
for
the
others
parched
by
days
and
sweltered
by
nights
of
battle
questioned
each
other
with
hollow
eyes
and
sleepy
voices
one
at
a
time
in
patches
of
hot
shade
they
lay
tumbled
for
a
moment
of
oblivion
their
backs
studded
thickly
with
obstinate
flies
like
the
driven
heads
of
nails
as
thickly
in
the
dust
empty
mauser
cartridges
lay
glistening
and
i
bought
food
mourned
the
captain
chafing
the
untidy
stubble
on
his
cheeks
and
staring
gloomily
down
at
the
worthless
brass
i
bought
chow
when
all
saigong
was
full
o
cartridges
the
sight
of
the
spent
ammunition
at
their
feet
gave
them
more
trouble
than
the
swarming
flies
or
the
heat
or
the
noises
tearing
and
splitting
the
heat
even
heywood
went
about
with
a
air
speaking
few
words
and
those
more
and
more
surly
once
he
laughed
when
at
broad
noonday
a
line
of
queer
heads
popped
up
from
the
earthwork
on
the
knoll
and
stuck
there
tilted
at
odd
angles
as
though
peering
quizzically
both
his
laugh
however
and
his
one
stare
of
scrutiny
were
filled
with
a
savage
contempt
contempt
not
only
for
the
stratagem
but
for
himself
the
situation
all
things
dummies
lay
figures
to
draw
our
fire
what
a
childish
trick
maskee
he
added
wearily
we
could
waste
a
shot
at
now
even
if
they
were
real
his
grimy
hearers
nodded
mechanically
they
knew
without
being
told
that
they
should
fire
no
more
until
at
close
quarters
in
some
final
rush
only
a
few
more
rounds
apiece
he
continued
our
friends
outside
must
have
run
nearly
as
short
according
to
the
coolie
we
took
prisoner
in
the
tunnel
but
they
get
more
supplies
he
says
in
a
day
or
two
what
worse
his
generalissimo
fang
expects
big
reinforcement
any
day
from
up
country
he
told
me
that
a
moment
ago
perhaps
he
lying
said
captain
kneebone
drowsily
wish
he
were
snapped
heywood
no
such
luck
too
stupid
that
case
grumbled
the
captain
we
better
signal
your
hakka
boat
and
clear
out
again
their
hollow
eyes
questioned
each
other
in
discouragement
it
was
plain
that
he
had
spoken
their
general
thought
but
they
were
all
too
hot
and
sleepy
to
debate
even
a
point
of
safety
thus
in
stupor
or
doubt
they
watched
another
afternoon
burn
low
by
invisible
degrees
like
a
great
fire
dying
another
breathless
evening
settled
over
all
at
first
with
a
dusty
copper
light
widespread
as
though
sky
and
land
were
seen
through
smoked
glass
another
dusk
of
deep
sad
blue
and
when
this
had
given
place
to
night
another
mysterious
lull
midnight
drew
on
and
no
further
change
had
come
prowlers
made
bold
by
the
long
silence
in
the
nunnery
came
and
went
under
the
very
walls
of
the
compound
in
the
court
beside
a
candle
ah
pat
the
compradore
sat
with
a
bundle
of
halberds
and
a
whetstone
sharpening
edge
after
edge
placidly
against
the
time
when
there
should
be
no
more
cartridges
heywood
and
rudolph
stood
near
the
water
gate
and
argued
with
gilbert
forrester
who
would
not
quit
his
post
for
either
of
them
but
i
not
sleepy
he
repeated
with
perverse
irritating
serenity
i
not
i
assure
you
and
that
river
full
of
their
boats
go
away
while
they
reasoned
and
wrangled
something
scraped
the
edge
of
the
wall
they
could
barely
detect
a
small
stealthy
movement
above
them
as
if
a
man
climbing
had
lifted
his
head
over
the
top
suddenly
beside
it
flared
a
surprising
torch
rags
burning
greasily
at
the
end
of
a
long
bamboo
the
smoky
dripping
flame
showed
no
man
there
but
only
another
long
bamboo
impaling
what
might
be
another
ball
of
rags
the
two
poles
swayed
inclined
toward
each
other
for
one
incredible
instant
the
ball
beside
its
glowing
fellow
shone
pale
and
took
on
human
features
black
shadows
filled
the
and
gave
to
the
face
an
uncertain
cavernous
look
as
though
it
saw
and
pondered
how
long
the
apparition
stayed
the
three
men
could
not
tell
for
even
after
it
vanished
and
the
torch
fell
hissing
in
the
river
they
stood
below
the
wall
dumb
and
sick
knowing
only
that
they
had
seen
the
head
of
wutzler
heywood
was
the
first
to
make
a
sound
a
broken
hypnotic
sound
without
emphasis
or
inflection
as
though
his
lips
were
frozen
or
the
words
torn
from
him
by
ventriloquy
we
must
get
the
women
out
of
here
afterward
when
he
was
no
longer
with
them
his
two
friends
recalled
that
he
never
spoke
again
that
night
but
came
and
went
in
a
kind
of
silent
rage
ordering
coolies
by
and
carrying
armful
after
armful
of
supplies
to
the
water
gate
he
would
neither
pause
nor
answer
the
word
passed
or
a
listless
tacit
understanding
that
every
one
must
hold
himself
ready
to
go
aboard
so
soon
after
daylight
as
the
hostile
boats
should
leave
the
river
if
said
gilly
to
rudolph
while
they
stood
thinking
under
the
stars
if
his
boat
is
still
there
now
that
he
after
what
we
saw
at
dawn
they
could
see
the
ragged
flotilla
of
sampans
stealing
on
the
early
flood
but
of
the
masts
that
huddled
in
vapors
by
the
farther
bank
they
had
no
certainty
until
sunrise
when
the
green
rag
and
the
appeared
still
dangling
above
the
hakka
boat
even
then
it
was
not
certain
as
captain
kneebone
sourly
pointed
out
that
her
sailors
would
keep
their
agreement
and
when
he
had
piled
on
the
the
dry
wood
for
their
signal
fire
a
new
difficulty
rose
one
of
the
wounded
converts
was
up
and
hobbling
with
a
stick
but
the
other
would
never
be
ferried
down
any
stream
known
to
man
he
lay
dying
and
the
padre
could
not
leave
him
all
the
others
waited
ready
and
anxious
but
no
one
grumbled
because
death
never
punctual
now
kept
them
waiting
the
flutter
of
birds
among
the
orange
trees
gradually
ceased
the
sun
came
slanting
over
the
eastern
wall
the
gray
floor
of
the
compound
turned
white
and
blurred
through
the
dancing
heat
a
torrid
westerly
breeze
came
fitfully
rose
died
away
rose
again
and
made
captain
kneebone
curse
a
fair
wind
lost
he
muttered
next
we
lose
the
ebb
too
be
noon
passed
and
before
the
padre
came
out
from
the
courtyard
covering
his
white
head
with
his
ungainly
helmet
we
may
go
now
he
said
gravely
in
a
few
minutes
no
more
were
needed
for
the
loose
clods
in
the
old
shaft
of
their
were
quickly
handled
and
the
necessary
words
soon
uttered
captain
kneebone
had
slipped
out
through
the
water
gate
beforehand
and
lighted
the
fire
on
the
steps
but
not
one
of
the
burial
party
turned
his
head
to
watch
the
success
or
failure
of
their
signal
so
long
as
the
padre
resonant
bass
continued
when
it
ceased
however
they
returned
quickly
through
the
little
grove
the
captain
opened
the
great
gate
and
looked
out
eagerly
craning
to
see
through
the
smoke
that
poured
into
his
face
the
wasters
he
cried
bitterly
she
gone
the
hakka
boat
had
indeed
vanished
from
her
moorings
on
the
bronze
current
nothing
moved
but
three
drifting
down
with
the
smoke
toward
the
marsh
and
the
bend
of
the
river
and
a
small
junk
that
toiled
up
against
wind
and
tide
a
cluster
of
naked
sailors
tugging
and
shoving
at
her
heavy
sweep
which
chafed
its
rigging
of
dry
rope
and
gave
out
a
high
complaining
note
like
the
cry
of
a
she
gone
repeated
captain
kneebone
no
boat
for
us
but
the
compradore
dragging
his
bundle
of
sharp
halberds
poked
an
inquisitive
head
out
past
the
captain
and
peered
on
all
sides
through
the
smoke
with
comical
thoroughness
he
dodged
back
grinning
and
ducking
amiably
moh
bettah
he
chuckled
dat
coolie
he
too
muchee
waitee
one
piecee
he
was
wrong
whoever
handled
the
hakka
boat
was
no
fool
but
by
working
upstream
on
the
opposite
shore
crossing
above
and
dropping
down
with
the
ebb
had
craftily
brought
her
along
the
shallow
so
close
beneath
the
that
not
till
now
did
even
the
little
captain
spy
her
the
high
prow
the
mast
now
bare
and
her
round
midships
roof
bright
with
leaves
of
the
edible
bamboo
came
moving
quiet
as
some
enchanted
boat
in
a
calm
the
fugitives
by
the
gate
still
thought
themselves
abandoned
when
her
beak
six
feet
in
air
stole
past
them
and
her
lean
boatmen
prodding
the
with
their
poles
stopped
her
as
easily
as
a
gondola
the
yellow
steersman
grinned
straining
at
the
pivot
of
his
gigantic
paddle
good
boy
lowdah
called
kneebone
remember
in
my
will
too
and
the
grinning
lowdah
nodded
as
though
he
understood
they
had
now
only
to
pitch
their
supplies
through
the
smoke
down
on
the
loose
boards
of
her
deck
then
rudolph
and
the
captain
kicking
the
bonfire
off
the
stairs
the
whole
company
hurried
down
and
safely
over
her
gunwale
first
the
two
women
then
the
few
huddling
converts
the
white
men
next
the
compradore
still
hugging
his
and
last
of
all
heywood
still
in
strange
apathy
with
haggard
face
and
downcast
eyes
he
stumbled
aboard
as
though
drunk
his
rifle
askew
under
one
arm
and
in
the
crook
of
the
other
flounce
the
dangling
nervous
and
wide
awake
he
looked
to
neither
right
nor
left
met
nobody
eye
the
rest
of
the
company
crowded
into
the
house
amidships
and
flung
themselves
down
wearily
in
the
grateful
dusk
where
vivid
paintings
and
mysteries
of
rude
carving
writhed
on
the
fir
bulkheads
but
heywood
with
his
dog
and
the
captain
and
rudolph
sat
in
the
hot
sun
staring
down
at
the
ramshackle
deck
through
the
gaps
in
which
rose
all
the
stinks
of
the
sweating
hold
the
boatmen
climbed
the
high
slant
of
the
bow
planted
their
stout
bamboos
against
their
shoulders
and
came
slowly
down
head
first
like
straining
acrobats
as
slowly
the
boat
began
to
glide
past
the
stairs
thus
far
though
the
fire
lay
scattered
in
the
mud
the
smoke
drifted
still
before
them
and
obscured
their
silent
headlong
transaction
now
thinning
as
they
dropped
below
the
corner
of
the
wall
it
left
them
naked
to
their
enemies
on
the
knoll
at
the
same
instant
from
the
marsh
ahead
the
sentinel
in
the
round
hat
sprang
up
again
like
an
instantaneous
mushroom
he
shouted
and
waved
to
his
fellows
inland
they
had
no
time
however
to
leave
the
high
ground
for
the
whole
chance
of
the
adventure
took
a
sudden
and
amazing
turn
heywood
sprang
out
of
his
stupor
and
stood
pointing
look
there
he
snarled
those
oh
he
ended
with
a
groan
the
face
of
his
friend
by
torchlight
above
the
wall
had
struck
him
dumb
now
that
he
spoke
his
companions
saw
exposed
in
the
field
to
the
view
of
the
nunnery
a
white
body
lying
on
a
framework
as
on
a
bier
near
the
foot
stood
a
rough
sort
of
windlass
above
on
the
crest
of
the
field
where
a
band
of
men
had
begun
to
scramble
at
the
sentinel
halloo
there
sat
on
a
white
pony
the
figure
of
the
tall
fanatic
fang
the
he
did
it
heywood
hands
opened
and
shut
rapidly
like

oh

he
snatched
blindly
at
his
gun
caught
instead
one
of
the
halberds
and
without
pause
or
warning
jumped
out
into
the
shallow
water
he
ran
splashing
toward
the
bank
turned
and
seemed
to
waver
staring
with
wild
eyes
at
the
strange
tudor
weapon
in
his
hand
then
shaking
it
savagely
this
will
do
he
cried
everybody
he
wheeled
again
staggered
to
his
feet
on
dry
ground
and
ran
swiftly
along
the
eastern
wall
up
the
rising
field
straight
toward
his
mark
of
the
men
on
the
knoll
a
few
fired
and
missed
the
others
neutrals
to

will
stood
fixed
in
wonder
four
or
five
as
the
runner
neared
sprang
out
to
intercept
but
flew
apart
like
ninepins
the
watchers
in
the
boat
saw
the
halberd
flash
high
in
the
late
afternoon
sun
the
frightened
pony
swerve
and
his
rider
go
down
with
the
one
sweep
of
that
homeric
blow
the
last
they
saw
of
heywood
he
went
leaping
from
sight
over
the
crest
that
swarmed
with
figures
racing
and
stumbling
after
the
unheeded
sentinel
in
the
marsh
fled
losing
his
great
hat
as
the
boat
drifted
round
the
point
into
midstream
chapter
xxi
the
dragon
shadow
the
lowdah
would
have
set
his
dirty
sails
without
delay
for
the
fair
wind
was
already
drooping
but
at
the
first
motion
he
found
himself
deposed
and
a
usurper
in
command
at
the
big
captain
kneebone
his
cheeks
white
and
suddenly
old
beneath
the
untidy
stubble
of
his
beard
had
taken
charge
in
momentary
danger
of
being
cut
off
downstream
or
overtaken
from
above
he
kept
the
boat
waiting
along
the
oozy
shore
puckering
his
eyes
he
watched
now
the
land
and
now
the
river
silent
furtive
and
keenly
perplexed
his
head
on
a
swivel
as
though
he
steered
by
some
nightmare
chart
or
expected
some
instant
and
transforming
sight
not
until
the
sun
touched
the
western
hills
and
long
shadows
from
the
bank
stole
out
and
turned
the
stream
from
bright
copper
to
vague
did
he
give
over
his
watch
he
left
the
tiller
with
a
hopeless
fling
of
the
arm
do
as
ye
please
he
growled
and
cast
himself
down
on
deck
by
the
thatched
house
go
i
never
see
the
heat
and
all
by
the
head
he
was
go
on
that
all
finish
he
sat
looking
straight
before
him
with
dull
eyes
that
never
moved
nor
did
he
stir
at
the
dry
rustle
and
scrape
of
the
matting
sail
slowly
hoisted
above
him
the
quaggy
banks
now
darkening
slid
more
rapidly
astern
while
the
steersman
and
his
mates
in
the
high
bow
invoked
the
wind
with
alternate
chant
plaintive
mysterious
and
half
musical
to
the
listeners
huddled
in
silence
the
familiar
cry
became
a
long
monotonous
accompaniment
to
sad
thoughts
through
the
rhythm
presently
broke
a
sound
of
a
few
shots
quick
but
softened
by
distance
from
far
inland
the
stillness
of
evening
followed
the
captain
stirred
listened
dropped
his
head
and
sat
like
stone
to
rudolph
near
him
the
brief
disturbance
called
up
another
evening
his
first
on
this
same
river
when
from
the
grassy
brink
above
he
had
first
heard
of
his
friend
now
at
the
same
place
and
by
the
same
light
they
had
heard
the
last
it
was
intolerable
he
turned
his
back
on
the
captain
inside
in
the
gloom
of
the
painted
cabin
the
wife
began
suddenly
to
cry
after
a
time
the
deep
voice
of
her
husband
speaking
very
low
and
to
her
alone
became
dimly
audible
this
is
come
upon
us
yet
have
we
not
our
heart
is
not
turned
back
neither
have
our
steps
declined
though
thou
hast
sore
broken
us
in
the
place
of
dragons
and
covered
us
with
the
shadow
of
death
the
little
captain
groaned
and
rolled
aside
from
the
doorway
all
very
fine
he
muttered
his
head
wrapped
in
his
arms
but
no
good
to
me
i
ca
stand
it
whether
she
heard
him
or
by
chance
miss
drake
came
quietly
from
within
and
found
a
place
between
him
and
the
gunwale
he
did
not
rouse
she
neither
glanced
nor
spoke
but
leaned
against
the
ribs
of
fir
as
though
calmly
waiting
when
at
last
he
looked
up
to
see
her
face
and
posture
he
gave
an
angry
start
and
i
thought
he
blurted
be
if
sometimes
i
did
think
you
liked
him
her
dark
eyes
met
the
captain
with
a
great
and
steadfast
clearness
no
she
whispered
it
was
more
than
that
the
captain
sat
bolt
upright
but
no
longer
in
condemnation
for
a
long
time
he
watched
her
marveling
and
when
finally
he
spoke
his
sharp
domineering
voice
was
lowered
almost
gentle
always
talked
too
much
he
said
do
mind
me
my
dear
i
never
meant
do
ye
mind
a
rough
old
beggar
that
do
know
that
has
one
thing
more
between
him
and
the
grave
not
a
thing
but
money
and
that
now
i
was
at
the
bottom
o
this
bloomin
river
they
said
no
more
but
rested
side
by
side
like
old
friends
joined
closer
by
new
grief
flounce
the
terrier
snuffing
disconsolately
about
the
deck
and
scratching
the
boards
in
her
zeal
to
explore
the
shallow
hold
at
last
grew
weary
and
came
to
snuggle
down
between
the
two
silent
companions
not
till
then
did
the
girl
turn
aside
her
face
as
though
studying
the
shore
which
now
melted
in
a
soft
band
as
black
as
above
the
luminous
indigo
of
the
river
suddenly
rudolph
got
upon
his
feet
and
craning
outboard
from
gunwale
and
thatched
eaves
looked
steadily
forward
into
the
dusk
a
chatter
of
angry
voices
came
stealing
up
in
the
pauses
of
the
wind
he
watched
and
listened
then
quickly
drew
in
his
head
sit
quiet
he
said
a
boat
full
of
men
i
do
not
like
their
looks
two
or
three
of
the
voices
hailed
together
raucously
the
steersman
leaning
on
the
loom
of
his
paddle
made
neither
stir
nor
answer
they
hailed
again
this
time
close
aboard
and
as
it
seemed
in
rage
glancing
contemptuously
to
starboard
the
lowdah
made
some
negligent
reply
about
a
cargo
of
human
hair
his
indifference
appeared
so
real
that
for
a
moment
rudolph
suspected
him
perhaps
he
had
been
bought
over
and
this
meeting
arranged
the
thought
however
was
unjust
the
voices
began
to
drop
astern
and
to
come
in
louder
confusion
with
the
breeze
but
at
this
point
flounce
the
terrier
spoiled
all
by
whipping
up
beside
the
lowdah
and
furiously
barking
hers
was
no
pariah
yelp
she
barked
with
spirit
in
the
king
english
for
answer
there
came
a
shout
a
sharp
report
and
a
bullet
that
ripped
through
the
matting
sail
the
steersman
ducked
but
clung
bravely
to
his
paddle
men
tumbled
out
from
the
cabin
rifles
in
hand
to
join
rudolph
and
the
captain
astern
dangerously
near
they
saw
the
hostile
craft
small
but
listed
heavily
with
crowding
ruffians
packed
so
close
that
their
great
wicker
hats
hung
along
the
gunwale
to
save
room
and
shone
dim
in
the
obscurity
like
golden
shields
of
vikings
a
squat
burly
fellow
shouting
jammed
the
yulow
hard
to
bring
her
about
save
your
fire
called
captain
kneebone
no
shots
to
waste
sit
tight
as
he
spoke
however
an
active
form
bounced
up
beside
the
squat
man
at
the
sweep
a
plump
muscular
little
barefoot
woman
in
blue
she
tore
the
fellow
hands
away
and
took
command
keeping
the
boat
nose
pointed
and
squalling
ferocious
orders
to
all
on
board
the
pretty
lily
cried
rudolph
this
small
nimble
capable
creature
could
be
no
one
but
wu
their
friend
and
gossip
of
that
morning
long
ago
the
squat
man
gave
an
angry
shout
and
turned
on
her
to
wrest
away
the
handle
he
failed
at
once
and
for
all
with
great
violence
yet
with
a
neat
economy
of
motion
the
pretty
lily
took
one
hand
from
her
tiller
long
enough
to
topple
him
overboard
with
a
sounding
splash
her
passengers
at
so
prompt
and
visual
a
joke
burst
into
shrill
cackling
laughter
yet
more
shrill
before
their
mood
could
alter
the
pretty
lily
scourged
them
with
the
tongue
of
a
humorous
woman
she
held
her
course
moreover
the
two
boats
drifted
so
quickly
apart
that
when
she
turned
to
fling
a
comic
farewell
after
the
white
men
they
could
no
more
than
descry
her
face
alert
and
comely
and
the
whiteness
of
her
teeth
her
laughing
cry
still
rang
the
overthrown
leader
still
floundered
in
the
water
when
the
picture
blurred
and
vanished
down
the
wind
came
her
words
high
voluble
quelling
all
further
mutiny
aboard
that
craft
of
hers
we
owe
this
to
you
the
tall
padre
eyed
rudolph
with
sudden
interest
and
laid
his
big
hand
on
the
young
man
shoulder
did
you
catch
what
she
said
you
made
a
good
friend
there
no
answered
rudolph
and
shook
his
head
sadly
we
owe
that
to
some
one
else
later
while
they
drifted
down
to
meet
the
sea
and
the
night
he
told
the
story
to
which
all
listened
with
profound
attention
wondering
at
the
turns
of
fortune
and
at
this
last
service
rendered
by
a
friend
they
should
see
no
more
they
murmured
awhile
by
twos
and
threes
huddled
in
corners
then
lay
silent
exhausted
in
body
and
spirit
the
river
melted
with
the
shore
into
a
common
blackness
faintly
hovered
over
by
the
hot
brown
sullen
evening
unchallenged
the
hakka
boat
flitted
past
the
lights
of
a
so
close
that
the
curved
flickered
thin
and
sharp
against
a
smoky
gleam
and
tawny
faces
wavered
thick
of
lip
and
stolid
of
eye
round
the
supper
fire
a
greasy
bitter
smell
of
cooking
floated
after
then
no
change
or
break
in
the
darkness
except
a
dim
lantern
or
two
creeping
low
in
a
sampan
with
a
fragment
of
talk
from
unseen
passers
until
as
the
stars
multiplied
overhead
the
night
of
the
land
rolled
heavily
astern
and
away
from
another
wider
night
the
stink
of
the
marshes
failed
and
by
a
blind
sense
of
greater
buoyancy
and
the
voyagers
knew
that
they
had
gained
the
roadstead
ahead
far
off
and
lustrous
a
new
field
of
stars
hung
scarce
higher
than
their
gunwale
above
the
rim
of
the
world
the
lowdah
showed
no
light
and
presently
none
was
needed
for
as
the
shallows
gave
place
to
deeps
the
ocean
boiled
with
the
hoary
magic
of
phosphorus
that
heaved
alongside
in
soft
explosions
of
and
sent
uncertain
smoky
tremors
playing
through
the
darkness
on
deck
rudolph
watching
this
tropic
miracle
could
make
out
the
white
figure
of
the
captain
asleep
near
by
under
the
faint
semicircle
of
the
and
across
from
him
miss
drake
still
sitting
upright
as
though
waiting
with
flounce
at
her
side
landward
against
the
last
vapor
of
daylight
ran
the
dim
range
of
the
hills
in
long
undulations
broken
by
sharper
crests
like
the
finny
back
of
leviathan
basking
over
there
thought
rudolph
beyond
that
black
shape
as
beyond
its
guarding
dragon
lay
the
whole
mysterious
and
peaceful
empire
with
uncounted
lives
going
on
ending
beginning
as
though
he
and
his
sore
loss
and
his
heart
vacant
of
all
but
grief
belonged
to
some
alien
process
to
nature
most
unworthy
trifling
this
boatload
of
men
and
women
so
huge
a
part
of
his
own
experience
was
like
the
tiniest
barnacle
chafed
from
the
side
of
that
dark
serene
monster
rudolph
stared
long
at
the
hills
and
as
they
faded
hung
his
head
from
that
dragon
he
had
learned
much
yet
now
all
learning
was
but
loss
of
a
sudden
the
girl
spoke
in
a
clear
yet
guarded
voice
too
low
to
reach
the
sleepers
what
are
you
thinking
of
she
said
come
tell
me
it
will
be
good
for
both
of
us
rudolph
crossed
silently
and
stood
leaning
on
the
gunwale
beside
her
i
thought
only
he
answered
how
much
the
hills
looked
so
as
a
dragon
how
strange
the
trembling
phosphorus
her
face
pale
and
still
i
was
thinking
of
that
in
a
way
it
reminded
me
of
what
he
said
once
when
we
were
walking
together
to
their
great
relief
they
found
themselves
talking
of
heywood
sadly
but
freely
and
as
it
were
in
a
sudden
calm
their
friendship
seemed
for
the
moment
a
thing
as
long
established
as
the
dragon
hills
years
afterward
rudolph
recalled
her
words
plainer
than
the
fiery
wonder
that
spread
and
burst
round
their
little
vessel
or
the
long
play
of
which
now
from
time
to
time
wavered
instantly
along
the
eastern
you
are
right
she
declared
once
to
go
on
with
life
even
when
we
are
alone
you
will
go
on
i
know
bravely
and
again
she
said
yes
such
men
as
he
are
a
sort
of
happy
warrior
and
later
in
her
slow
and
level
voice
you
learned
something
you
say
is
that
what
i
call
being
invulnerable
when
a
man
greater
than
anything
that
happens
to
him
so
they
talked
their
speech
bare
and
simple
but
the
pauses
and
longer
silences
filled
with
deep
understanding
solemnized
by
the
time
and
the
place
as
though
their
two
lonely
spirits
caught
wisdom
from
the
night
scope
from
the
silent
ocean
light
from
the
flickering
east
the
flashes
meanwhile
came
faster
and
prolonged
their
glory
running
behind
a
thin
dead
screen
of
scalloped
clouds
piercing
the
tropic
sky
with
summer
blue
and
ripping
out
the
lost
horizon
like
a
long
black
fibre
from
pulp
the
two
friends
watched
in
silence
when
rudolph
rose
and
moved
cautiously
aft
he
whispered
you
must
sleep
now
that
was
not
however
the
reason
so
long
as
the
boiling
turned
their
wake
to
golden
vapor
he
could
not
be
sure
but
whenever
the
ran
and
through
the
sere
phantasmal
sail
the
lookout
in
the
bow
flashed
like
a
sharp
silhouette
through
wire
gauze
then
it
seemed
to
rudolph
that
another
small
black
shape
leapt
out
astern
and
vanished
he
stood
by
the
lowdah
watching
anxiously
time
and
again
the
ocean
flickered
into
view
like
the
floor
of
a
measureless
cavern
and
still
he
could
not
tell
but
at
last
the
lowdah
also
turned
his
head
and
murmured
their
boat
creaked
monotonously
drifting
to
leeward
in
a
riot
of
golden
mist
yet
now
another
creaking
disturbed
the
night
in
a
different
cadence
another
boat
followed
them
rowing
fast
and
gaining
in
a
brighter
flash
her
black
sail
fluttered
unmistakable
rudolph
reached
for
his
gun
but
waited
silently
he
would
not
call
out
some
chance
fisherman
it
might
be
or
any
small
craft
holding
the
same
course
along
the
coast
still
he
did
not
like
the
hurry
of
the
sweeps
which
presently
groaned
louder
and
threw
up
nebulous
fire
the
stranger
bow
became
an
arrowhead
of
running
gold
and
here
was
flounce
ready
to
misbehave
once
more
before
he
could
catch
her
the
small
white
body
of
the
terrier
whipped
by
him
and
past
the
steersman
this
time
however
as
though
cowed
she
began
to
whimper
and
then
maintained
a
long
trembling
whine
beside
rudolph
the
compradore
head
bobbed
up
allo
same
she
mastah
come
and
in
his
native
tongue
ah
pat
grumbled
something
about
ghosts
a
harsh
voice
hailed
from
the
boat
astern
the
lowdah
answered
and
so
rapidly
slid
the
deceptive
glimmer
of
her
bow
that
before
rudolph
knew
whether
to
wake
his
friends
or
could
recover
next
from
the
shock
and
ecstasy
of
unbelief
a
tall
white
figure
jumped
or
swarmed
over
the
side
by
jove
my
dream
sounded
the
voice
of
heywood
gravely
with
fingers
that
dripped
gold
he
tried
to
pat
the
bounding
terrier
she
flew
up
at
him
and
tumbled
back
in
the
liveliest
danger
of
falling
overboard
old
girl
my
dream
the
figure
rose
hallo
rudie
in
a
daze
rudolph
gripped
the
wet
and
shining
hands
and
heard
the
same
quiet
voice
rest
all
asleep
i
suppose
do
wake
will
have
you
any
money
on
you
toss
that
fisherman
whatever
you
think
i
worth
he
really
rowed
like
steam
you
know
rudolph
flung
his
purse
into
the
other
boat
when
he
turned
this
man
restored
from
the
sea
had
disappeared
but
he
had
only
stolen
forward
dog
in
arms
to
sit
beside
miss
drake
so
quietly
had
all
happened
that
none
of
the
sleepers
not
even
the
captain
was
aware
rudolph
drew
near
the
two
murmuring
could
help
it
honestly
said
heywood
ca
describe
or
explain
just
something
went
black
inside
my
head
you
know
he
paused
no
do
recall
seeing
a
thing
really
until
i
pitched
away
the
what
happened
to
be
in
my
hands
a
blank
all
that
losing
your
head
i
suppose
they
call
it
most
extraordinary
the
girl
question
recalled
him
from
his
puzzle
do
oh
he
disposed
of
the
subject
easily
i
ran
that
oh
yes
but
i
ran
not
half
so
many
as
you
suppose
most
of
were
away
burning
your
hospital
saw
the
smoke
as
i
ran
all
gone
but
a
handful
hence
those
stuffed
hats
rudie
in
the
only
three
of
the
lot
could
run
i
merely
scuttled
into
the
next
bamboo
and
kept
on
scuttling
no
they
were
half
loaded
oh
yes
arrow
in
the
shoulder
scratch
of
course
when
it
came
dark
i
stopped
running
and
made
for
the
nearest
fisherman
that
all
but
protested
rudolph
wondering
we
heard
shots
yes
i
had
my
webley
in
my
belt
fortunately
i
you
three
of
them
could
run
the
speaker
patted
the
terrier
in
his
lap
my
dream
eh
little
dog
you
the
only
one
to
know
no
said
the
girl
i
knew
all
the
time
that
whatever
she
meant
rudolph
could
only
guess
but
it
was
true
he
thought
that
she
had
never
once
spoken
as
though
the
present
meeting
were
not
possible
here
or
somewhere
recalling
this
he
suddenly
but
quietly
stepped
away
aft
to
sit
beside
the
steersman
and
smile
in
the
darkness
the
two
voices
flowed
on
he
did
not
listen
but
watched
the
phosphorus
welling
soft
and
turbulent
in
the
wake
and
far
off
in
glimpses
of
the
tropic
light
the
great
dragon
weltering
on
the
face
of
the
waters
the
shape
glimmered
forth
died
away
like
a
prodigy
how
ran
the
verse
ich
lieg
und
besitze
lass
mich
schlafen
and
yet
thought
the
young
man
i
have
one
pearl
from
his
hoard
that
girl
was
right
like
siegfried
tempered
in
the
grisly
flood
the
raw
boy
was
turning
into
a
man
seasoned
and
invulnerable
heywood
was
calling
to
him
you
must
go
home
with
us
do
you
hear
i
made
a
wonderful
plan
with
the
captain
fortune
dear
old
kneebone
a
small
white
heap
across
the
deck
began
to
rise
how
often
complained
a
voice
blurred
with
sleep
how
often
must
i
tell
ye
wake
me
unless
the
ship
chart
all
good
god
at
the
captain
cry
those
who
lay
in
darkness
under
the
thatched
roof
began
to
mutter
to
rise
and
grope
out
into
the
trembling
light
with
sleepy
cries
of
joy
