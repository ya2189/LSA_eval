people
dined
earlier
forty
years
ago
than
they
do
now
even
that
salt
of
the
earth
the
elect
of
society
represented
by
that
little
great
world
which
lies
between
the
narrow
circle
bounded
by
bryanstone
square
on
the
north
and
by
birdcage
walk
on
the
south
did
not
consider
seven
too
early
an
hour
for
a
dinner
party
which
was
to
be
followed
by
routs
drums
concerts
conversazione
as
the
case
might
be
it
was
seven
on
a
lovely
june
evening
and
the
park
was
already
deserted
and
carriages
were
rolling
swiftly
along
all
the
westend
squares
carrying
rank
fashion
wealth
and
beauty
political
influence
and
intellectual
power
to
the
particular
circle
in
which
each
was
destined
to
illumine
upon
that
particular
evening
stateliest
among
london
squares
grosvenor
in
some
wise
a
wonder
to
the
universe
as
newly
lighted
with
gas
grave
grosvenor
with
its
heavy
old
georgian
houses
and
pompous
porticoes
sparkled
and
shone
not
alone
with
the
novel
splendour
of
gas
but
with
the
light
of
many
wax
candles
clustering
in
silver
branches
and
girandoles
multiplying
their
flame
in
numerous
mirrors
and
of
all
the
houses
in
that
stately
square
none
had
a
more
imposing
aspect
than
lord
denyer
dark
red
brick
mansion
with
stone
dressings
and
the
massive
grandeur
of
an
egyptian
mausoleum
lord
denyer
was
an
important
personage
in
the
political
and
diplomatic
world
he
had
been
ambassador
at
constantinople
and
at
paris
and
had
now
retired
on
his
laurels
an
influence
still
but
no
longer
an
active
power
in
the
machine
of
government
at
his
house
gathered
all
that
was
most
brilliant
in
london
society
to
be
seen
at
lady
denyer
evening
parties
was
the
guinea
stamp
of
social
distinction
to
dine
with
lord
denyer
was
an
opening
in
life
almost
as
valuable
as
university
honours
and
more
difficult
of
attainment
it
was
during
the
quarter
of
an
hour
before
dinner
that
a
group
of
persons
mostly
personages
congregated
round
lord
naturally
trending
towards
the
social
hearth
albeit
it
was
the
season
for
roses
and
lilies
rather
than
of
fires
and
the
hum
of
the
city
was
floating
in
upon
the
breath
of
the
warm
june
evening
through
the
five
tall
windows
which
opened
upon
lord
denyer
balcony
the
ten
or
twelve
persons
assembled
seemed
only
a
sprinkling
in
the
large
lofty
room
furnished
sparsely
with
amber
satin
sofas
a
pair
of
florentine
marble
tables
and
half
an
acre
or
so
of
looking
glass
voluminous
amber
draperies
shrouded
the
windows
and
deadened
the
sound
of
rolling
wheels
and
the
voices
and
footfalls
of
western
london
the
drawing
rooms
of
those
days
were
neither
artistic
nor
picturesque
neither
early
english
nor
low
dutch
nor
renaissance
nor
a
stately
commonplace

reception

of

at
a
dead
level

lady
denyer
stood
a
little
way
in
advance
of
the
group
on
the
hearthrug
fanning
herself
with
her
eye
on
the
door
while
she
listened
languidly
to
the
remarks
of
a
youthful
diplomatist
a
sprig
of
a
lordly
tree
upon
the
last
at
her
majesty
theatre
own
idea
was
that
she
screamed
said
her
ladyship
the
new
rosinas
generally
do
scream
why
do
we
have
a
new
rosina
every
year
whom
nobody
ever
hears
of
afterwards
what
becomes
of
them
do
they
die
or
do
they
set
up
as
singing
mistresses
in
hazarded
her
ladyship
with
her
eye
always
on
the
door
she
was
a
large
woman
in
amethyst
satin
and
a
gauze
turban
with
a
diamond
aigrette
a
splendid
jewel
which
would
not
have
misbeseemed
the
of
an
indian
prince
lady
denyer
was
one
of
the
last
women
who
wore
a
turban
and
that
oriental
became
her
bold
and
massive
features
infinitely
bored
by
the
whiskerless
attaché
who
had
entered
upon
a
disquisition
on
the
genius
of
rossini
as
compared
with
this
new
man
meyerbeer
her
ladyship
made
believe
to
hear
while
she
listened
intently
to
the
confidential
murmurs
of
the
group
on
the
hearthrug

little
knot
of
personages
clustered
round

this
morning

flagrant

and

passage
home
said
another
man
lord
denyer
shrugged
his
shoulders
pursed
up
his
lips
and
looked
ineffably
wise
a
way
he
had
when
he
knew
very
little
about
the
subject
under
discussion

take
it
do
you

man
about

of
people
great

his

to
be
here
this
evening
do
you

the
colonel
mail
must
have
brought
the
news
to
her
as
well
as
to
other
people
supposing
she
knew
nothing
about
it
beforehand
she
must
know
that
the
storm
has
burst
do
you
think
she
out
in
the
thunder
and
lightning
interrupted
lord
denver
sure
she
will
she
has
the
pride
of
lucifer
and
the
courage
of
a
lion

that
she
is

than

against
her
maulevrier
announced
the
groom
of
the
chambers
and
lady
denyer
moved
at
least
three
paces
forward
to
meet
her
guest
the
lady
who
entered
with
slow
and
stately
movements
and
proudly
balanced
head
might
have
served
for
a
model
as
juno
or
the
empress
livia
she
was
still
in
the
bloom
of
youth
at
most
but
she
had
all
the
calm
assurance
of
no
dowager
hardened
by
the
varied
experiences
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
the
great
world
could
have
faced
society
with
more
perfect
coolness
and
she
was
beautiful
and
she
let
the
world
see
that
she
was
conscious
of
her
beauty
and
the
power
that
went
along
with
it
she
was
clever
and
she
used
her
cleverness
with
unfailing
tact
and
unscrupulous
audacity
she
had
won
her
place
in
the
world
as
an
acknowledged
beauty
and
one
of
the
leaders
of
fashion
two
years
ago
she
had
been
the
glory
and
delight
of
society
in
the
city
of
madras
ruling
that
remote
and
limited
kingdom
with
a
despotic
power
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
was
ordered
or
she
ordered
her
physician
to
order
her
an
immediate
departure
from
that
perilous
climate
and
she
came
back
to
england
with
her
son
two
ayahs
and
four
european
servants
leaving
her
husband
lord
maulevrier
governor
of
the
madras
presidency
to
finish
the
term
of
his
service
in
an
enforced
widowhood
she
returned
to
be
the
delight
of
london
society
she
threw
open
the
family
mansion
in
curzon
street
to
the
very
best
people
but
to
those
only
she
went
out
a
great
deal
but
she
was
never
seen
at
a
party
she
had
not
a
single
doubtful
acquaintance
upon
her
visiting
list
she
spent
half
of
every
year
at
the
family
seat
in
scotland
was
a
miracle
of
goodness
to
the
poor
of
her
parish
and
taught
her
boy
his
alphabet
lord
denyer
came
forward
while
his
wife
and
lady
maulevrier
were
shaking
hands
and
greeted
her
with
more
than
his
usual
cordiality
colonel
madison
watched
for
the
privilege
of
a
recognising
nod
from
the
divinity
sir
jasper
paulet
a
legal
luminary
of
the
first
brilliancy
likely
to
be
employed
for
the
crown
if
there
should
be
an
inquiry
into
lord
maulevrier
conduct
out
yonder
came
to
press
lady
hand
and
murmur
a
tender
welcome
she
accepted
their
friendliness
as
a
matter
of
course
and
not
by
the
faintest
extra
quiver
of
the
tremulous
stars
which
glittered
in
a
circlet
above
her
raven
hair
did
she
betray
her
consciousness
of
the
cloud
that
darkened
her
husband
reputation
never
had
she
appeared
gayer
or
more
completely
satisfied
with
herself
and
the
world
in
which
she
lived
she
was
ready
to
talk
about
anything
and
everything
the
queen
and
the
fortunate
prince
whose
existence
among
us
had

charm

or

paper

parisian
prototype
seated
next
lord

who
was
an
excellent
listener
lady
maulevrier
vivacity
never
flagged
throughout
the
dinner
happily
not
so
long
as
a
modern
banquet
albeit
more
ponderous
and
not
less
expensive
from
the
turtle
to
the
pines
and
strawberries
lady
maulevrier
held
her
host
or
her
neighbour
in
interested
conversation
she
always
knew
the
particular
subjects
likely
to
interest
particular
people
and
was
a
good
listener
as
well
as
a
good
talker
her
neighbour
was
sir
jasper
paulet
who
had
been
allotted
to
the
pompous
wife
of
a
court
physician
a
lady
who
had
begun
her
married
life
in
the
outer
darkness
of
guildford
street
bloomsbury
with
a
household
consisting
of
a
and
a
boy
in
buttons
with
an
occasional
interregnum
of
charwoman
and
for
whom
all
the
length
and
breadth
of
harley
street
was
now
much
too
small
sir
jasper
was
only
decently
civil
to
this
haughty
matron
who
on
the
strength
of
a
card
for
a
ball
or
a
concert
at
the
palace
once
in
a
season
affected
to
be
on
the
most
intimate
terms
with
royalty
and
knew
everything
that
happened
and
every
fluctuation
of
opinion
in
that
charmed
circle
the
great
lawyer
left
ear
was
listening
greedily
for
any
word
of
meaning
that
might
fall
from
the
lips
of
lady
maulevrier
but
no
such
word
fell
she
talked
delightfully
with
a
vivacity
which
is
the
highest
form
of
talk
not
dwelling
with
a
heavy
hand
upon
any
one
subject
but
glancing
from
theme
to
theme
with
airy
lightness
but
not
one
word
did
she
say
about
the
governor
of
madras
and
at
this
juncture
of
affairs
it
would
have
been
the
worst
possible
taste
to
inquire
too
closely
after
his
lordship
welfare
so
the
dinner
wore
on
to
its
stately
close
and
just
as
the
solemn
procession
of
flunkeys
long
as
the
shadowy
line
of
the
kings
in
filed
off
with
the
empty
lady
maulevrier
said
something
which
was
as
if
a
shell
had
exploded
in
the
middle
of
the
table
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
in
such
good
spirits
she
said
beaming
upon
her
host
and
speaking
in
those
clear
perfectly
finished
syllables
which
are
heard
further
than
the
louder
accents
of
less
polished
speakers
you
will
not
wonder
when
i
let
you
into
the
secret
maulevrier
is
on
his
way
home
said
lord
denyer
with
the
most
benignant
smile
he
could
command
at
such
short
notice
he
felt
that
the
muscles
round
his
eyes
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
were
betraying
too
much
of
his
real
sentiments
must
be
very
glad
am
gladder
than
i
can
say
answered
lady
maulevrier
gaily
horried
climate
a
sky
like
molten
copper
an
atmosphere
that
tastes
of
sand
that
flat
barren
coast
never
suited
him
his
term
of
office
would
expire
in
little
more
than
a
year
but
i
hardly
think
he
could
have
lived
out
the
year
however
i
am
happy
to
say
the
mail
that
came
in
i
suppose
you
know
the
mail
is
in
lord
denyer
bowed
me
a
letter
from
his
lordship
telling
me
that
he
has
sent
in
his
resignation
and
taken
his
passage
by
the
next
big
ship
that
leaves
madras
i
imagine
he
will
be
home
in
october
he
have
a
favourable
passage
said
lord
denyer
by
your
good
wishes
the
winds
and
the
waves
ought
to
deal
gently
with
him
we
have
done
with
the
old
days
of
greek
story
when
neptune
was
open
to
feminine
influence
sighed
her
ladyship
poor
ulysses
has
no
goddess
of
wisdom
to
look
after
him
not
but
he
has
the
most
charming
of
penelopes
waiting
for
him
at
home
penelope
who
goes
to
dinners
and
takes
life
pleasantly
in
his
absence
that
is
a
new
order
of
things
is
it
not
said
her
ladyship
laughingly
hope
my
poor
ulysses
will
not
come
home
thoroughly
broken
in
health
but
that
our
sutherlandshire
breezes
will
set
him
up
again
an
ordeal
after
india
i
should
think
said
lord
denyer
is
his
native
air
he
will
revel
in
it
country
no
doubt
assented
his
lordship
who
was
no
sportsman
and
who
detested
scotland
grouse
moors
deer
forests
salmon
rivers
included
his
only
idea
of
a
winter
residence
was
florence
or
capri
and
of
the
two
he
preferred
capri
the
island
was
at
that
time
little
frequented
by
englishmen
it
had
hardly
been
fashionable
since
the
time
of
tiberius
but
lord
denyer
went
there
accompanied
by
his
french
chef
and
a
dozen
other
servants
and
roughed
it
in
a
native
hotel
while
lady
denyer
wintered
at
the
family
seat
among
the
hills
near
bath
and
gave
herself
over
to
low
church
devotion
and
works
of
benevolence
she
made
herself
a
terror
to
the
neighbourhood
by
the
strictness
of
her
ideas
all
through
the
autumn
and
winter
and
in
the
spring
she
went
up
to
london
put
on
her
turban
and
her
diamonds
and
plunged
into
the
vortex
of
society
where
she
revolved
among
other
jewelled
matrons
for
the
season
telling
herself
and
her
intimates
that
this
sacrifice
of
inclination
was
due
to
his
lordship
position
lady
denyer
was
not
the
less
because
she
was
seen
at
every
aristocratic
resort
and
wore
low
gowns
with
very
short
sleeves
and
a
great
display
of
mottled
arm
and
dimpled
elbow
now
came
her
ladyship
smiling
signal
for
the
withdrawal
of
that
fairer
half
of
the
assembly
which
was
supposed
to

been
throwing
out
her
gracious
signals
unperceived
for
at

five
minutes
before
lady
maulevrier
responded
so
entirely
was
that
lady
absorbed
in
her
conversation
with
lord
denyer
but
she
caught
the
look
at
last
and
rose
as
if
moved
by
the
same
machinery
which
impelled
her
hostess
and
then
graceful
as
a
swan
sailing
with
the
current
she
drifted
down
the
room
to
the
distant
door
and
headed
the
stately
procession
of
matronly
velvet
and
diamonds
herself
at
once
the
most
regal
and
the
most
graceful
figure
in
that
bevy
of
fair
woman
in
the
nobody
could
be
gayer
than
lady
maulevrier
as
she
marked
the
time
of
signor
paponizzi

exquisitely
performed
on
the

or
talked
of
the

always
excepting

which
involved

in
subdued
murmurs
with
one
of
her
intimates
in
the
the
men
drew
closer
together
over
their
wine
and
tore
lord
maulevrier
character
to
rags
yea
they
rent
him
with
their
teeth
and
gnawed
the
flesh
from
his
bones
until
there
was
not
so
much
left
of
him
as
the
dogs
left
of
jezebel
he
had
been
a
scamp
from
his
cradle
a
spendthrift
at

and
oxford
a

in

false
to

false
to

clever
yes
undoubtedly
just
as
satan
is
clever
and
as
unscrupulous
as
that
very
satan
this
was
what
his
friends
said
of
him
over
their

and
now
he
was
rumoured
to
have
sold
the
british
forces
in

yes
to

rapacious
moments
never
dreamt
of
for
his
countrymen
blood
tidings
of
dark
transactions
between
the
governor
and
the
native
princes
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
government
tidings
so
vague
so
incredible
that
the
government
might
naturally
be
slow
to
believe
still
slower
to
act
there
were
whispers
of
a
influence
a
beautiful
ranee
a
creature
as
fascinating
and
as
unscrupulous
as
cleopatra
the
scandal
had
been
growing
for
months
past
but
it
was
only
in
the
letters
received
that
the
rumour
had
taken
a
tangible
shape
and
now
it
was
currently
reported
that
lord
maulevrier
had
been
recalled
and
would
have
to
answer
at
the
bar
of
the
house
of
lords
for
his
misdemeanours
which
were
of
a
much
darker
colour
than
those
acts
for
which
warren
hastings
had
been
called
to
account
fifty
years
before
yet
in
the
face
of
all
this
lady
maulevrier
bore
herself
as
proudly
as
if
her
husband
name
were
spotless
and
talked
of
his
return
with
all
the
ardour
of
a
fond
and
trusting
wife
of
the
finest
bits
of
acting
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
said
the
court
physician
mars
never
did
anything
better
you
really
think
it
was
acting
inquired
lord
denyer
affecting
a
youthful
candour
and
trustfulness
which
at
his
age
and
with
his
experience
he
could
hardly
be
supposed
to
possess
know
it
replied
the
doctor
watched
her
while
she
was
talking
of
maulevrier
and
i
saw
just
one
bead
of
perspiration
break
out
on
her
upper
lip
an
unmistakable
sign
of
the
mental
struggle
chapter
ii
ulysses
october
was
ending
drearily
with
winds
dust
drifting
dead
leaves
and
a
sky
and
the
dolphin
hotel
at
southampton
was
glorified
by
the
presence
of
lady
maulevrier
and
suite
her
suite
was
on
this
occasion
limited
to
three
servants
her
french
maid
a
footman
and
a
kind
of
factotum
a
man
of
no
distinct
and
arbitrary
signification
in
her
ladyship
household
neither
butler
nor
steward
but
that
privileged
being
an
old
and
trusted
servant
and
a
person
who
was
supposed
to
enjoy
more
of
lady
maulevrier
confidence
than
any
other
member
of
her
establishment
this
james
steadman
had
been
valet
to
her
ladyship
father
lord
peverill
during
the
declining
years
of
that
nobleman
the
narrow
limits
of
a
sick
room
had
brought
the
master
and
servant
into
a
closer
companionship
than
is
common
to
that
relation
lady
diana
angersthorpe
was
a
devoted
daughter
and
in
her
attendance
upon
the
earl
during
the
last
three
years
of
his
life
a
life
which
closed
more
than
a
year
before
her
own
marriage
she
saw
a
great
deal
of
james
steadman
and
learned
to
trust
him
as
servants
are
not
often
trusted
he
was
not
more
than
twenty
years
of
age
at
the
beginning
of
his
service
but
he
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
gravity
much
in
advance
of
his
years
a
man
of
shrewd
and
clear
sharp
intellect
not
a
reading
man
or
a
man
in
any
way
superior
to
his
station
and
belongings
but
a
man
who
could
think
quickly
and
understand
quickly
and
who
always
seemed
to
think
rightly
prompt
in
action
yet
steady
as
a
rock
and
to
all
appearance
recognising
no
earthly
interest
no
human
tie
beyond
or
above
the
interests
of
his
master
as
a
nurse
steadman
showed
himself
invaluable
lord
peverill
left
him
a
hundred
pounds
in
acknowledgment
of
his
services
which
was
something
for
lord
peverill
who
had
very
little
ready
cash
wherewith
to
endow
his
only
daughter
after
his
death
the
title
and
the
estates
went
to
a
distant
cousin
lady
diana
angersthorpe
was
taken
in
hand
by
her
aunt
the
dowager
marchioness
of
carrisbrook
and
james
steadman
would
have
had
to
find
employment
among
strangers
if
lady
diana
had
not
pleaded
so
urgently
with
her
aunt
as
to
secure
him
a
somewhat
insignificant
post
in
her
ladyship
establishment
ever
i
have
a
house
of
my
own
you
shall
have
a
better
place
in
it
steadman
said
lady
diana
she
kept
her
word
and
on
her
marriage
with
lord
maulevrier
which
happened
about
eighteen
months
afterwards
steadman
passed
into
that
nobleman
service
he
was
a
member
of
her
ladyship
bodyguard
and
his
employment
seemed
to
consist
chiefly
in
poking
fires
cutting
the
leaves
of
books
and
newspapers
superintending
the
footman
attendance
upon
her
ladyship
household
pets
and
conveying
her
sentiments
to
the
other
servants
he
was
in
a
manner
lady
maulevrier
mouthpiece
and
although
treated
with
a
respect
that
verged
upon
awe
he
was
not
a
favourite
with
the
household
and
now
the
house
in
mayfair
was
given
over
to
the
charge
of
caretakers
all
the
other
servants
had
been
despatched
by
coach
to
her
favourite
retreat
in
westmoreland
within
a
few
miles
of
the
home
at
rydal
mount
and
james
steadman
was
charged
with
the
whole
responsibility
of
her
ladyship
travelling
arrangements
penelope
had
come
to
southampton
to
wait
for
ulysses
whose
ship
had
been
due
for
more
than
a
week
and
whose
white
sails
might
be
expected
above
the
horizon
at
any
moment
james
steadman
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
time
waiting
about
at
the
docks
for
the
earliest
news
of
greene
ship
the
while
lady
maulevrier
waited
patiently
in
her
at
the
dolphin
whose
three
long
french
windows
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
high
street
with
all
those
various
distractions
afforded
by
the
chief
thoroughfare
of
a
provincial
town
her
ladyship
was
provided
with
a
large
box
of
books
from
ebers
in
bond
street
a
basket
of
fancy
work
and
her
favourite
blenheim
spaniel
lalla
rookh
but
even
these
sources
of
amusement
did
not
prevent
the
involuntary
expression
of
weariness
in
occasional
yawns
and
frequent
pacings
up
and
down
the
room
where
the
formal
hotel
furniture
had
a
comfortless
and
chilly
look
fellside
her
ladyship
place
in
westmoreland
was
the
pleasure
house
which
among
all
her
possessions
she
most
valued
but
it
had
hitherto
been
reserved
for
summer
occupation
or
for
perhaps
two
or
three
weeks
at
easter
when
the
spring
was
exceptionally
fine
the
sudden
determination
to
spend
the
coming
winter
in
the
house
near
grasmere
was
considered
a
curious
freak
of
lady
maulevrier
and
she
was
constrained
to
explain
her
motives
to
her
friends
lordship
is
out
of
health
she
said
wants
perfect
rest
and
retirement
now
fellside
is
the
only
place
we
have
in
which
he
is
likely
to
get
perfect
rest
anywhere
else
we
should
have
to
entertain
fellside
is
out
of
the
world
there
is
no
one
to
be
entertained
your
neighbour
wordsworth
i
suppose
you
see
him
sometimes
old
soul
he
gives
nobody
any
trouble
said
her
ladyship
is
not
westmoreland
very
cold
in
winter
asked
her
friend
lady
maulevrier
smiled
benignly
as
at
an
inoffensive
ignorance
sheltered
she
murmured
are
at
the
base
of
the
fell
loughrigg
rises
up
like
a
cyclopean
wall
between
us
and
the
wind
when
the

other
direction

nabb
scar
you
do
not
know
how
we
are
girdled
and
defended
by
hills
pleasant
agreed
the
friend
for
my
own
part
i
would
rather
winter
in
the
south
those
terrible
rumours
which
had
first
come
upon
the
world
of
london
last
june
had
been
growing
darker
and
more
defined
ever
since
but
still
lady
maulevrier
made
believe
to
ignore
them
and
she
acted
her
part
of
unconsciousness
with
such
consummate
skill
that
nobody
in
her
circle
could
be
sure
where
the
acting
began
and
where
the
ignorance
left
off
the
astute
lord
denyer
declared
that
she
was
a
wonderful
woman
and
knew
more
about
the
real
state
of
the
case
than
anybody
else
meanwhile
it
was
said
by
those
who
were
supposed
to
be
that
a
mass
of
evidence
was
accumulating
against
lord
maulevrier
the
india
house
it
was
rumoured
was
busy
with
the
secret
investigation
of
his
case
prior
to
that
public
inquiry
which
was
to
come
on
during
the
next
session
his
private
fortune
would
be
made
answerable
for
his
misdemeanours
his
life
said
the
alarmists
might
pay
the
penalty
of
his
treason
on
all
sides
it
was
agreed
that
the
case
against
lord
maulevrier
was
black
as
erebus
and
still
lady
maulevrier
looked
society
in
the
face
with
an
unshaken
courage
and
was
ready
with
smiles
and
gracious
words
for
all
comers
but
now
came
a
harder
trial
which
was
to
receive
the
man
who
had
disgraced
her
lowered
her
pride
to
the
dust
degraded
the
name
she
bore
she
had
married
him
not
loving
him
nay
plucking
another
love
out
of
her
heart
in
order
that
she
might
give
herself
to
him
she
had
married
him
for
position
and
fortune
and
now
by
his
follies
by
his
extravagance
and
by
that
greed
of
gold
which
is
inevitable
in
the
spendthrift
and
profligate
he
had
gone
near
to
cheat
her
out
of
both
name
and
fortune
yet
she
so
commanded
herself
as
to
receive
him
with
a
friendly
air
when
he
arrived
at
the
dolphin
on
a
dull
grey
autumn
afternoon
after
she
had
waited
for
him
nearly
a
fortnight
james
steadman
ushered
in
his
lordship
a
frail
attenuated
looking
figure
of
middle
height
wrapped
in
a
furred
cloak
yet
shivering
a
pale
sickly
face
light
auburn
whiskers
light
blue
eyes
full
and
large
but
with
no
intellectual
power
in
them
lady
maulevrier
was
sitting
by
the
fire
in
a
melancholy
attitude
with
the
blenheim
spaniel
on
her
lap
her
son
was
at
hastings
with
his
nurses
she
had
nothing
nearer
and
dearer
than
the
spaniel
she
rose
and
went
over
to
her
husband
and
let
him
kiss
her
it
would
have
been
too
much
to
say
that
she
kissed
him
but
she
submitted
her
lips
unresistingly
to
his
and
then
they
sat
down
on
opposite
sides
of
the
hearth
wretched
afternoon
said
his
lordship
shivering
and
drawing
his
chair
closer
to
the
fire
steadman
had
taken
away
his
cloak
had
really
underrated
the
disagreeableness
of
the
english
climate
it
is
abominable
is
not
a
fair
sample
answered
her
ladyship
trying
to
be
cheerful
have
had
some
pleasant
autumn
days
detest
autumn
exclaimed
lord
maulevrier
season
of
dead
leaves
damp
and
dreariness
i
should
like
to
get
away
to
montpellier
or
nice
as
soon
as
we
can
her
ladyship
gave
him
a
scathing
look
surely
would
not
dream
of
leaving
the
country
she
said
present
circumstances
so
long
as
you
are
here
to
answer
all
charges
no
one
will
interfere
with
your
liberty
but
if
you
were
to
cross
the
channel
slanderers
might
insinuate
that
i
was
running
away
interrupted
maulevrier
the
very
fact
of
my
return
ought
to
prove
to
every
one
that
i
am
able
to
meet
and
face
this
cabal
it
a
cabal
asked
her
ladyship
looking
at
him
with
a
gaze
that
searched
his
soul
you
meet
their
charges
can
you
live
down
this
hideous
accusation
and
hold
up
your
head
as
a
man
of
honour
the
sensualist
blue
eyes
nervously
shunned
that
look
of
earnest
interrogation
his
lips
answered
the
wife
spoken
question
with
a
lie
a
lie
made
manifest
by
the
expression
of
his
countenance
am
not
afraid
he
said
his
wife
answered
not
a
word
she
was
assured
that
the
charges
were
true
and
that
the
battered
rake
who
shivered
over
the
fire
had
neither
courage
nor
ability
to
face
his
accusers
she
saw
the
whole
fabric
of
her
life
in
ruins
her
son
the
penniless
successor
to
a
tarnished
name
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes
lady
maulevrier
sat
with
lowered
eyelids
looking
at
the
fire
deep
in
painful
thought
two
perpendicular
wrinkles
upon
her
broad
white
forehead
so
calm
so
unclouded
in
society
told
of
gnawing
cares
then
she
stole
a
look
at
her
husband
as
he
reclined
in
his
his
head
lying
back
against
the
cushions
in
listless
repose
his
eyes
looking
vacantly
at
the
window
whence
he
could
see
only
the
fronts
of
opposite
houses
blank
dull
windows
grey
slated
roofs
against
a
leaden
sky
he
had
been
a
handsome
man
and
he
was
handsome
still
albeit
premature
decay
the
result
of
an
evil
life
was
distinctly
marked
in
his
faded
face
the
dull
yellow
tint
of
the
complexion
the
tarnished
dimness
of
the
large
blue
eyes
the
discontented
droop
of
the
lips
the
languor
of
the
attitude
the
pallid
transparency
of
the
wasted
hands
all
told
of
a
life
worn
threadbare
energies
exhausted
chances
thrown
away
a
mind
abandoned
to
despair
look
very
ill
said
his
wife
after
that
long
blank
interval
which
marked
so
unnatural
an
apathy
between
husband
and
wife
meeting
after
so
long
a
severance
am
very
ill
i
have
been
worried
to
death
surrounded
by
rogues
and
liars
the
victim
of
a
most
infernal
conspiracy
he
spoke
hurriedly
growing
whiter
and
more
tremulous
as
he
went
on
talk
about
it
you
agitate
yourself
to
no
purpose
said
lady
maulevrier
with
a
tranquillity
which
seemed
heartless
yet
which
might
be
the
result
of
suppressed
feeling
you
are
to
face
this
scandal
firmly
and
boldly
next
january
you
must
try
to
recover
physical
strength
in
the
meanwhile
mental
energy
may
come
with
better
health
shall
never
be
any
better
said
lord
maulevrier
testily
infernal
climate
has
shattered
my
constitution
or
three
months
of
perfect
rest
and
good
nursing
will
make
a
new
man
of
you
i
have
arranged
that
we
shall
go
straight
from
here
to
fellside
no
one
can
plague
you
there
with
that
disguised
impertinence
called
sympathy
you
can
give
all
your
thoughts
to
the
ordeal
before
you
and
be
ready
to
meet
your
accusers
fortunately
you
have
no
burke
against
you
you
think
of
going
to
fellside
you
know
how
fond
i
am
of
that
place
i
little
thought
when
you
settled
it
upon
me
a
cottage
in
westmoreland
with
fifty
acres
of
garden
and
meadow
so
utterly
insignificant
that
i
should
ever
like
it
better
than
any
of
your
places
charming
retreat
in
summer
but
we
have
never
wintered
there
what
put
it
into
your
head
to
go
there
at
such
a
season
as
this
why
i
daresay
the
snow
is
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
already
is
the
only
place
i
know
where
you
will
not
be
watched
and
talked
about
replied
lady
maulevrier
will
be
out
of
the
eye
of
the
world
i
should
think
that
consideration
would
weigh
more
with
you
than
two
or
three
degrees
of
the
thermometer
detest
cold
said
the
earl
in
my
weak
health
will
take
care
of
you
answered
her
ladyship
and
in
the
discussion
which
followed
she
bore
herself
so
firmly
that
her
husband
was
fain
to
give
way
how
could
a
disgraced
and
ruined
man
broken
in
health
and
spirits
contest
the
mere
details
of
life
with
a
woman
ten
years
his
junior
the
earl
wanted
to
go
to
london
and
remain
there
at
least
a
week
but
this
her
ladyship
strenuously
opposed
he
must
see
his
lawyer
he
urged
there
were
steps
to
be
taken
which
could
be
taken
only
under
legal
advice
counsel
to
be
retained
if
this
lying
invention
of
satan
were
really
destined
to
take
the
form
of
a
public
trial
he
must
be
prepared
to
fight
his
foes
on
their
own
ground
can
make
all
your
preparations
at
fellside
answered
his
wife
resolutely
have
seen
rigby
and
rider
and
your
own
particular
ally
rigby
will
go
to
you
at
fellside
whenever
you
want
him
is
not
like
my
being
on
the
spot
said
his
lordship
nervously
evidently
much
disconcerted
by
her
ladyship
firmness
but
too
feeble
in
mind
and
body
for
a
prolonged
contest
ought
to
be
on
the
spot
i
am
not
without
influence
i
have
friends
men
in
power
you
are
not
going
to
appeal
to
friendship
in
order
to
vindicate
your
honour
these
charges
are
true
or
false
if
they
are
false
your
own
manhood
your
own
rectitude
can
face
them
and
trample
upon
them
unaided
by
influence
if
they
are
true
no
one
can
help
you
think
you
at
least
ought
to
know
that
they
are
as
false
as
hell
retorted
the
earl
with
an
attempt
to
maintain
his
dignity
have
acted
as
if
i
so
believed
replied
his
wife
have
lived
as
if
there
were
no
such
slanders
in
the
air
i
have
steadily
ignored
every
report
every
insinuation
have
held
my
head
as
high
as
if
i
knew
you
were
immaculate
expected
as
much
from
you
answered
the
earl
coolly
i
had
not
known
you
were
a
woman
of
sense
i
should
not
have
married
you
this
was
his
utmost
expression
of
gratitude
his
next
remarks
had
reference
solely
to
his
own
comfort
where
were
his
rooms
at
what
hour
were
they
to
dine
and
hereupon
he
rang
for
his
valet
a
german
swiss
and
a
servant
out
of
a
thousand
chapter
iii
on
the
wrong
road
lord
and
lady
maulevrier
left
southampton
next
morning
posting
they
took
two
servants
in
the
rumble
steadman
and
the
footman
steadman
was
to
valet
his
lordship
the
footman
to
be
useful
in
all
emergencies
of
the
journey
the
maid
and
the
valet
were
to
travel
by
heavy
coach
with
the
luggage
her
ladyship
dispensing
with
all
personal
attendance
during
the
journey
the
first
day
took
them
to
rugby
whither
they
travelled
across
country
by
wallingford
and
oxford
the
second
day
took
them
to
lichfield
lord
maulevrier
was
out
of
health
and
feeble
and
grumbled
a
good
deal
about
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
the
badness
of
the
weather
which
was
dull
and
cold
east
winds
all
day
and
a
light
frost
morning
and
night
as
they
progressed
northward
the
sky
looked
grayer
the
air
became
more
biting
his
lordship
insisted
upon
the
stages
being
shortened
he
lay
in
bed
at
his
hotel
till
noon
and
was
seldom
ready
to
start
till
two
he
could
see
no
reason
for
haste
the
winter
would
be
long
enough
in
all
conscience
at
fellside
he
complained
of
mysterious
aches
and
pains
described
himself
in
the
presence
of
and
headwaiters
as
a
mass
of
maladies
he
was
nervous
irritable
intensely
disagreeable
lady
maulevrier
bore
his
humours
with
unwavering
patience
and
won
golden
opinions
from
all
sorts
of
people
by
her
devotion
to
a
husband
whose
blighted
name
was
the
common
talk
of
england
everybody
even
in
distant
provincial
towns
had
heard
of
the
scandal
against
the
governor
of
madras
and
everybody
looked
at
the
sallow
faded
with
morbid
curiosity
his
lordship
sensitive
on
all
points
touching
his
own
ease
and
comfort
was
keenly
conscious
of
this
unflattering
inquisitiveness
the
journey
protracted
by
lord
maulevrier
languor
and
dragged
its
slow
length
along
for
nearly
a
fortnight
until
it
seemed
to
lady
maulevrier
as
if
they
had
been
travelling
upon
those
dismal
flat
unpicturesque
roads
for
months
each
day
was
so
horribly
like
yesterday
the
same
hedgerows
and
flat
fields
and
passing
glimpse
of
river
or
canal
the
same
absence
of
all
beauty
in
the
landscape
the
same
formal
hotel
rooms
and
smirking
landladies
and
so
on
till
they
came
to
lancaster
after
which
the
country
became
more
interesting
hills
arose
in
the
background
even
the
smoky
manufacturing
towns
through
which
they
passed
without
stopping
were
less
abominable
than
the
level
monotony
of
the
midland
counties
but
now
as
they
drew
nearer
the
hills
the
weather
grew
colder
snow
was
spoken
of
and
when
they
got
into
westmoreland
the
gleamed
whitely
against
a
sky
ought
not
to
have
brought
me
here
in
such
weather
complained
the
earl
shivering
in
his
sables
as
he
sat
in
his
corner
of
the
travelling
chariot
looking
discontentedly
at
the
gloomy
landscape
is
to
become
of
us
if
we
are
caught
in
a
snowstorm
shall
have
no
snow
worth
talking
about
before
we
are
safely
housed
at
fellside
and
then
we
can
defy
the
elements
said
lady
maulevrier
coolly
they
slept
that
night
at
oxenholme
and
started
next
morning
under
a
clean
bright
sky
intending
to
take
luncheon
at
windermere
and
to
be
at
home
by
nightfall
but
by
the
time
they
got
to
windermere
the
sky
had
changed
to
a
dark
grey
and
the
people
at
the
hotel
prophesied
a
heavy
fall
before
night
and
urged
the
earl
and
countess
to
go
no
further
that
day
the
latter
part
of
the
road
to
fellside
was
rough
and
hilly
if
there
should
be
a
snowstorm
the
horses
would
never
be
able
to
drag
the
carriage
up
the
steepest
bit
of
the
way
here
however
lord
maulevrier
obstinacy
came
into
play
he
would
not
endure
another
night
at
an
hotel
so
near
his
own
house
he
was
sick
to
death
of
travelling
and
wanted
to
be
at
rest
among
comfortable
surroundings
was
murder
to
bring
me
here
he
said
to
his
wife
i
had
gone
to
hastings
i
should
have
been
a
new
man
by
this
time
as
it
is
i
am
a
great
deal
worse
than
when
i
landed
everyone
at
the
hotel
noticed
his
lordship
white
and
haggard
looks
he
had
been
known
there
as
a
young
man
in
the
bloom
of
health
and
strength
and
his
decay
was
particularly
obvious
to
these
people
saw
death
in
his
face
the
landlord
said
afterwards
every
one
even
her
ladyship
firmness
and
good
sense
gave
way
before
the
invalid
impatience
at
three
in
the
afternoon
they
left
the
hotel
with
four
horses
to
make
the
remaining
nineteen
miles
of
the
way
in
one
stage
they
had
not
been
on
the
road
half
an
hour
before
the
snow
began
to
fall
thickly
whitening
everything
around
them
except
the
lake
which
showed
a
dark
leaden
surface
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
along
the
edge
of
which
they
were
travelling
too
sullen
for
speech
lord
maulevrier
sat
back
in
his
corner
with
his
sable
cloak
drawn
up
to
his
chin
his
travelling
cap
covering
head
and
ears
his
eyes
contemplating
the
whitening
world
with
a
weary
anger
his
wife
watched
the
landscape
as
long
as
she
could
but
the
snow
soon
began
to
darken
all
the
air
and
she
could
see
nothing
save
that
blank
blinding
fall
to
fellside
there
was
a
point
where
two
roads
met
one
leading
towards
grasmere
the
other
towards
the
village
of
great
langdale
a
cluster
of
humble
habitations
in
the
heart
of
the
hills
when
the
horses
had
struggled
as
far
as
this
point
the
snow
was
six
inches
deep
on
the
road
and
made
a
thick
curtain
around
them
as
it
fell
by
this
time
the
earl
had
dozed
off
to
sleep
he
woke
an
hour
after
let
down
the
window
which
let
in
a
gust
and
tried
to
pierce
the
gloom
without
black
as
erebus
he
exclaimed
we
ought
to
be
close
at
home
by
this
time
yes
thank
god
there
are
the
lights
the
carriage
drew
up
a
minute
afterwards
and
steadman
came
to
the
door
sorry
my
lord
the
horses
must
have
taken
a
wrong
turn
after
we
crossed
the
bridge
and
now
the
men
say
they
ca
go
back
to
fellside
unless
we
can
get
fresh
horses
and
i
afraid
there
no
chance
of
that
here
exclaimed
the
earl
do
you
mean
by
here
where
the
devil
are
we
langdale
my
lord
a
door
opened
and
let
out
a
flood
of
light
the
red
light
of
a
wood
fire
the
pale
flame
of
a
candle
upon
the
snowy
darkness
revealing
the
panelled
hall
of
a
neat
little
rustic
inn
an
clock
ticking
in
the
corner
a
black
and
white
coming
out
at
his
master
heels
to
investigate
the
travellers
to
the
right
of
the
door
showed
the
light
of
a
window
sheltered
by
a
red
curtain
behind
which
the
chiefs
of
the
village
were
enjoying
their
evening
you
any
asked
the
earl
discontentedly
as
the
landlord
stood
on
the
threshold
shading
the
candle
with
his
hand
sir
we
do
keep
course
not
i
knew
as
much
before
i
asked
said
the
earl
are
fixed
in
this
dismal
hole
for
the
night
i
suppose
how
far
are
we
from
fellside
miles
answered
the
landlord
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
i
did
know
it
was
your
lordship
he
added
hurriedly
in
sore
trouble
and
it
makes
a
man
but
if
there
anything
we
can
do
there
no
hope
of
getting
on
steadman
asked
the
earl
cutting
short
these
civilities
with
these
horses
my
lord
you
hear
we
ca
get
any
others
is
there
any
farmer
about
here
who
could
lend
us
a
pair
of
carriage
horses
the
landlord
knew
of
no
such
person
we
must
stop
here
till
morning
what
infernal
fools
those
must
be
protested
lord
maulevrier
james
steadman
apologised
for
the
postilions
explaining
that
when
they
came
to
the
critical
point
of
their
journey
where
the
road
branched
off
to
the
langdales
the
snow
was
falling
so
thickly
the
whole
country
was
so
hidden
in
whiteness
that
even
he
who
knew
the
way
so
well
could
give
no
help
to
the
drivers
he
could
only
trust
to
the
instinct
of
local
postilions
and
local
horses
and
instinct
had
proved
wrong
the
travellers
alighted
and
were
ushered
into
a
not
parlour
very
low
as
to
the
ceiling
very
as
to
the
furniture
but
spotlessly
clean
and
enlivened
by
a
good
fire
to
which
his
lordship
drew
near
shivering
and
muttering
discontentedly
to
himself
might
be
worse
off
said
her
ladyship
looking
round
the
bright
little
room
which
pleased
her
better
than
many
a
state
apartment
in
the
large
hotels
at
which
they
had
stopped
unless
we
were
out
on
the
moor
grumbled
her
husband
am
sick
to
death
of
this
unreasonable
journey
i
am
at
a
loss
to
imagine
your
motive
in
bringing
me
here
you
must
have
had
a
motive
had
answered
lady
maulevrier
with
a
freezing
look
wanted
to
get
you
out
of
the
way
i
told
you
that
plainly
enough
at
southampton
do
see
why
i
should
be
hurried
away
and
hidden
said
lord
maulevrier
must
face
my
accusers
sooner
or
later
course
the
day
of
reckoning
must
come
but
in
the
meantime
have
you
no
delicacy
do
you
want
to
be
pointed
at
everywhere
i
know
is
that
i
am
very
ill
answered
her
husband
that
this
wretched
journey
has
made
me
twenty
years
older
shall
be
safe
at
home
before
noon
and
you
can
have
horton
to
set
you
right
again
you
know
you
always
believed
in
his
skill
is
a
clever
fellow
enough
as
country
doctors
go
but
at
hastings
i
could
have
had
the
best
physicians
in
london
to
see
me
grumbled
his
lordship
the
rustic
came
in
to
lay
the
table
assisted
by
her
ladyship
footman
who
looked
a
good
deal
too
tall
for
the
room
sha
dine
said
the
earl
am
a
great
deal
too
ill
and
cold
light
a
fire
in
my
room
girl
and
send
steadman
to
me
this
to
the
footman
who
hastened
to
obey
can
send
me
up
a
basin
of
soup
presently
i
shall
go
to
bed
at
once
he
left
the
room
without
another
word
to
his
wife
who
sat
by
the
hearth
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
cheery
wood
fire
presently
she
looked
up
and
saw
that
the
man
and
maid
were
going
on
with
their
preparations
for
dinner
do
not
care
about
dining
alone
said
her
ladyship
lunched
at
windermere
and
i
have
no
appetite
you
can
clear
away
those
things
and
bring
me
some
tea
when
the
table
furniture
had
been
cleared
and
a
neat
little
set
upon
the
white
cloth
lady
maulevrier
drew
her
chair
to
the
table
and
took
out
her
from
which
she
produced
a
letter
this
she
read
more
than
once
meditating
profoundly
upon
its
contents
am
very
sorry
he
has
come
home
wrote
her
correspondent
yet
if
he
had
stayed
in
india
there
must
have
been
an
investigation
on
the
spot
a
public
inquiry
is
inevitable
and
the
knowledge
of
his
arrival
in
the
country
will
precipitate
matters
from
all
i
hear
i
much
fear
that
there
is
no
chance
of
the
result
being
favourable
to
him
you
have
asked
me
to
write
the
unvarnished
truth
to
be
brutal
even
remember
his
delinquencies
are
painfully
notorious
and
i
apprehend
that
the
last
sixpence
he
owns
will
be
answerable
his
landed
estate
i
am
told
can
also
be
confiscated
in
the
event
of
an
impeachment
at
the
bar
of
the
house
of
lords
as
in
the
warren
hastings
case
but
as
yet
nobody
seems
clear
as
to
the
form
which
the
investigation
will
take
in
reply
to
your
inquiry
as
to
what
would
have
happened
if
his
lordship
had
died
on
the
passage
home
i
believe
i
am
justified
in
saying
the
scandal
would
have
been
allowed
to
die
with
him
he
has
contrived
to
provoke
powerful
animosities
both
in
the
cabinet
and
at
the
india
house
and
there
is
i
fear
an
intention
to
pursue
the
inquiry
to
the
bitter
end
assurances
of
the
writer
sympathy
followed
these
harsh
truths
but
to
this
polite
commonplace
her
ladyship
paid
no
attention
her
mind
was
intent
on
hard
facts
the
dismal
probabilities
of
the
near
future
he
had
died
upon
the
passage
home
she
repeated
to
god
that
he
had
so
died
and
that
my
son
name
and
fortune
could
be
saved
the
innocent
child
who
had
never
given
her
an
hour
care
the
one
creature
she
loved
with
all
the
strength
of
her
proud
nature
his
future
was
to
be
blighted
by
his
father
misdoings
overshadowed
by
shame
and
dishonour
in
the
very
dawn
of
life
it
was
a
wicked
wish
an
unnatural
wish
to
find
room
in
a
woman
breast
but
the
wish
was
there
would
to
god
he
had
died
before
the
ship
touched
an
english
port
but
he
was
living
and
would
have
to
face
his
accusers
and
she
his
wife
must
give
him
all
the
help
she
could
she
sat
long
by
the
waning
fire
she
took
nothing
but
a
cup
of
tea
although
the
landlady
had
sent
in
substantial
accompaniments
to
the
in
the
shape
of
broiled
ham
eggs
and
hot
cakes
arguing
that
a
traveller
on
such
a
night
must
be
hungry
albeit
disinclined
for
a
ceremonious
dinner
she
had
been
sitting
for
nearly
an
hour
in
almost
the
same
attitude
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
on
being
bidden
to
enter
the
landlady
came
in
with
some
logs
in
her
apron
under
pretence
of
replenishing
the
fire
was
afraid
your
fire
must
be
getting
low
and
that
you
be
amost
starved
my
lady
she
said
as
she
put
on
the
logs
and
swept
up
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
a
dreadful
night
so
early
in
the
year
too
i
thinking
we
shall
have
a
gay
hard
winter
does
not
always
follow
said
lady
maulevrier
steadman
come
downstairs
my
lady
he
told
me
to
tell
your
ladyship
that
his
lordship
is
pretty
comfortable
and
hopes
to
pass
a
good
night
am
glad
to
hear
it
you
can
give
me
another
room
i
suppose
it
would
be
better
for
his
lordship
not
to
be
disturbed
as
he
is
very
much
out
of
health
is
another
room
my
lady
but
it
very
small
do
mind
how
small
if
it
is
clean
and
airy
my
lady
i
am
thankful
to
say
you
wo
find
dirt
or
stuffiness
anywhere
in
this
house
his
lordship
do
look
mortal
badly
added
the
landlady
shaking
her
head
dolefully
i
remember
him
such
a
fine
young
gentleman
when
he
used
to
come
down
the
rothay
with
the
otter
hounds
running
along
the
bank
joomping
in
and
out
of
the
beck
up
to
his
knees
in
the
water
and
now
to
see
him
so
white
and
mashiated
and
like
in
the
very
prime
of
life
all
along
of
living
out
in
a
hot
country
among
blackamoors
which
is
used
to
it
poor
ignorant
creatures
and
never
knew
no
better
it
must
be
a
hard
trial
for
you
my
lady
is
a
hard
trial
we
all
have
our
trials
rich
and
poor
sighed
the
woman
who
desired
nothing
better
than
to
be
allowed
to
unbosom
her
woes
to
the
grand
looking
lady
in
the
cloth
pelisse
with
beautiful
dark
hair
piled
up
in
clustering
masses
above
a
broad
white
forehead
and
slender
white
hands
on
which
diamonds
flashed
and
glittered
in
the
firelight
an
unaccustomed
figure
by
that
rustic
hearth
all
have
our
trials
high
and
low
reminds
me
said
lady
maulevrier
looking
up
at
her
husband
said
you
were
in
trouble
what
did
that
mean
in
the
house
my
lady
a
brother
of
mine
that
went
to
america
to
make
his
fortune
and
seemed
to
be
doing
so
well
for
the
first
five
or
six
years
and
wrote
home
such
beautiful
letters
and
then
left
off
writing
all
at
once
and
we
made
sure
as
he
was
dead
and
never
got
a
word
from
him
for
ten
years
and
just
three
weeks
ago
he
drops
in
upon
us
as
we
was
sitting
over
our
tea
between
the
lights
looking
as
white
as
a
ghost
i
gave
a
shriek
when
i
saw
him
for
i
was
regular
scared
out
of
my
senses
robert
ghost
i
cried
but
it
was
robert
himself
come
home
to
us
to
die
and
he
lying
upstairs
now
with
so
little
life
in
him
that
i
expect
every
breath
to
be
his
last
is
his
complaint
my
lady
dear
dear
that
not
it
i
never
do
remember
the
doctor
foreign
names
perhaps
my
lady
that
was
it
happen
such
words
come
easy
to
a
scholar
like
your
ladyship
the
doctor
give
no
hope
no
my
lady
he
do
go
so
far
as
to
say
there
no
hope
though
robert
has
been
badly
so
long
it
all
depends
he
says
upon
the
rallying
power
of
the
constitution
the
lungs
are
not
gone
and
the
heart
is
not
diseased
if
there
rallying
power
robert
will
come
round
and
if
there
is
he
sink
but
the
doctor
says
nature
will
have
to
make
an
effort
but
i
have
my
own
idea
about
the
case
added
the
landlady
with
a
sigh
is
your
idea
our
robert
was
marked
for
death
when
he
came
into
this
house
and
that
he
meant
what
he
said
when
he
spoke
of
coming
home
to
die
things
had
gone
against
him
for
the
last
ten
years
in
america
he
married
and
took
his
wife
out
to
a
farm
in
the
bush
and
thought
to
make
a
good
thing
out
of
farming
with
the
bit
of
brass
he
saved
at
heeam
but
america
is
gert
langdale
you
see
my
lady
and
his
knowledge
stood
him
in
no
stead
in
the
bush
and
first
he
lost
his
money
and
he
fashed
himself
terrible
about
that
and
then
he
lost
a
child
or
two
and
then
he
lost
his
wife
and
he
came
back
to
us
a
man
with
no
wish
to
live
the
doctor
may
call
it
atrophy
but
i
will
call
it
what
the
scripture
calls
it
a
broken
and
a
wounded
spirit
is
your
doctor
evans
of
ambleside
little
old
man
exclaimed
her
ladyship
you
have
no
confidence
in
him
much
my
lady
but
i
do
believe
all
the
doctors
in
london
could
do
anything
for
robert
good
nursing
will
bring
him
round
if
anything
can
and
he
gets
that
i
can
assure
your
ladyship
he
my
only
brother
the
only
kith
and
kin
that
left
to
me
and
he
and
i
were
gay
fond
of
each
other
when
he
was
young
you
may
be
sure
i
do
spare
any
trouble
and
my
good
man
thinks
the
best
of
his
larder
or
his
celler
hardly
good
enough
for
robert
am
sure
you
are
kind
good
people
replied
her
ladyship
gently
i
should
have
thought
horton
of
grasmere
could
have
done
more
than
old
evans
however
you
know
best
i
hope
his
lordship
is
not
going
to
add
to
your
cares
by
being
laid
up
here
but
he
looked
very
ill
this
evening
did
my
lady
mortal
bad
we
must
hope
for
the
best
steadman
is
a
splendid
servant
in
illness
he
nursed
my
father
for
years
will
you
tell
him
to
come
to
me
if
you
please
i
want
to
hear
what
he
thinks
of
his
lordship
and
to
discuss
the
chances
of
our
getting
home
early
the
landlady
retired
and
summoned
steadman
who
was
enjoying
his
modest
glass
of
grog
in
front
of
the
kitchen
fire
he
had
taught
himself
to
dispense
with
the
consolations
of
tobacco
lest
he
should
at
any
time
make
himself
obnoxious
to
her
ladyship
steadman
was
closeted
with
lady
maulevrier
for
the
next
during
which
his
lordship
condition
was
gravely
discussed
when
he
left
the
he
told
the
landlord
to
be
sure
and
feed
the
well
and
make
them
comfortable
for
the
night
so
that
they
might
be
ready
for
the
drive
to
fellside
early
next
morning
you
think
his
lordship
will
be
well
enough
to
travel
asked
the
landlord
has
made
up
his
mind
to
get
home
ill
or
well
answered
steadman
has
wasted
about
a
week
by
his
dawdling
ways
on
the
road
and
now
he
in
a
fever
to
get
to
fellside
chapter
iv
the
last
stage
the
which
had
been
well
fed
but
accommodated
somewhat
poorly
in
stable
and
barn
were
quite
ready
to
go
on
next
morning
but
lord
maulevrier
was
not
able
to
leave
his
room
where
her
ladyship
remained
in
close
attendance
upon
him
the
hills
and
valleys
were
white
with
snow
but
there
was
none
falling
and
evans
the
elderly
surgeon
from
ambleside
rode
over
to
great
langdale
on
his
elderly
cob
to
look
at
robert
haswell
and
was
called
in
to
see
lord
maulevrier
her
ladyship
had
spoken
lightly
of
his
skill
on
the
previous
evening
but
any
doctor
is
better
than
none
so
this
feeble
little
personage
was
allowed
to
feel
his
lordship
pulse
and
look
at
his
lordship
tongue
his
opinion
never
too
decidedly
given
was
a
little
more
hazy
than
usual
on
this
occasion
perhaps
because
of
a
certain
awfulness
to
unaccustomed
eyes
in
lady
maulevrier
proud
bearing
he
said
that
his
lordship
was
low
very
low
and
that
the
pulse
was
more
irregular
than
he
liked
but
he
committed
himself
no
further
than
this
and
went
away
promising
to
send
such
pills
and
potions
as
were
appropriate
to
the
patient
condition
a
boy
rode
the
same
pony
over
to
langdale
later
in
the
afternoon
with
the
promised
medicines
throughout
the
short
winter
day
which
seemed
terribly
long
in
the
stillness
and
solitude
of
great
langdale
lady
maulevrier
kept
watch
in
the
steadman
going
in
and
out
in
constant
attendance
upon
his
master
save
for
one
only
which
her
ladyship
passed
in
the
parlour
below
in
conversation
with
the
landlady
a
very
serious
conversation
as
indicated
by
smithson
grave
and
somewhat
troubled
looks
when
she
left
her
ladyship
but
a
good
deal
of
her
trouble
may
have
been
caused
by
her
anxiety
about
her
brother
who
was
pronounced
by
the
doctor
to
be
the
same
at
eleven
that
night
a
mounted
messenger
was
sent
off
to
ambleside
in
hot
haste
to
fetch
evans
who
came
to
the
inn
to
find
lady
maulevrier
kneeling
beside
her
husband
bed
while
steadman
stood
with
a
troubled
countenance
at
a
respectful
distance
the
room
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
pair
of
candles
burning
on
a
table
near
the
window
and
at
some
distance
from
the
old
bedstead
shaded
by
dark
moreen
curtains
the
surgeon
looked
round
the
room
and
then
fumbled
in
his
pockets
for
his
spectacles
without
the
aid
of
which
the
outside
world
presented
itself
to
him
under
a
blurred
and
uncertain
aspect
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
moved
towards
the
bed
but
the
first
glance
in
that
direction
showed
him
what
had
happened
the
outline
of
the
rigid
figure
under
the
coverlet
looked
like
a
sculptured
effigy
upon
a
tomb
a
sheet
was
drawn
over
the
face
of
death
are
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
evans
murmured
steadman
laying
his
hand
upon
the
doctor
sleeve
and
drawing
him
away
towards
the
door
they
went
softly
on
to
the
landing
off
which
opened
the
door
of
that
other
where
the
landlady
brother
was
lying
did
this
happen
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
messenger
rode
off
to
fetch
you
answered
steadman
lordship
lay
all
the
afternoon
in
a
heavy
sleep
and
we
thought
he
was
going
on
well
but
after
dark
there
was
a
difficulty
in
his
breathing
which
alarmed
her
ladyship
and
she
insisted
upon
you
being
sent
for
the
messenger
had
hardly
been
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
his
lordship
woke
suddenly
muttered
to
himself
in
a
curious
way
gave
just
one
long
drawn
sigh
and
and
all
was
over
it
was
a
terrible
shock
for
her
ladyship
it
must
have
been
murmured
the
village
doctor
is
a
great
surprise
to
me
i
knew
lord
maulevrier
was
low
very
low
the
pulse
feeble
and
intermittent
but
i
had
no
fear
of
anything
of
this
kind
it
is
very
sudden
it
is
awfully
sudden
said
steadman
and
then
he
murmured
in
the
doctor
ear
will
give
the
necessary
certificate
i
hope
with
as
little
trouble
to
her
ladyship
as
possible
this
is
a
dreadful
blow
and
she
shall
not
be
troubled
the
body
will
be
removed
i
suppose
he
must
be
buried
from
his
own
house
i
sent
a
second
messenger
to
ambleside
for
the
undertaker
he
will
be
here
very
soon
no
doubt
and
if
the
shell
is
ready
by
noon
the
body
can
be
removed
then
i
have
arranged
to
get
her
ladyship
away
late
after
midnight
not
she
can
not
stay
in
this
small
house
so
near
the
dead
there
is
a
moon
and
there
is
no
snow
falling
and
we
are
within
seven
miles
of
fellside
the
doctor
had
nothing
further
to
say
against
the
arrangement
although
such
a
drive
seemed
to
him
a
somewhat
wild
and
reckless
proceeding
steadman
grave
manner
answered
all
doubts
evans
filled
in
the
certificate
for
the
undertaker
drank
a
glass
of
hot
brandy
and
water
and
remounted
his
nag
in
nowise
relishing
his
midnight
ride
but
consoling
himself
with
the
reflection
that
he
would
be
handsomely
paid
for
his
trouble
an
hour
later
lady
maulevrier
travelling
carriage
stood
ready
in
the
stable
yard
in
the
deep
shadow
of
wall
and
gables
it
was
at
order
that
the
carriage
waited
for
her
ladyship
at
an
obscure
side
door
rather
than
in
front
of
the
inn
an
east
wind
was
blowing
keenly
along
the
mountain
road
and
the
careful
steadman
was
anxious
his
mistress
should
not
be
exposed
to
that
chilly
blast
there
was
some
delay
and
the
four
horses
jingled
their
bits
impatiently
and
then
the
door
of
the
inn
opened
a
feeble
light
gleamed
in
the
narrow
passage
within
steadman
stood
ready
to
assist
her
ladyship
there
was
a
bustle
a
confusion
of
dark
figures
on
the
threshold
a
huddled
mass
of
cloaks
and
fur
wraps
was
lifted
into
the
carriage
the
door
was
clapped
to
the
horses
went
clattering
out
of
the
yard
turned
sharply
into
the
snowy
road
and
started
at
a
swinging
pace
towards
the
dark
sullen
bulk
of
loughrigg
fell
the
moon
was
shining
upon
elterwater
in
the
valley
yonder
the
mountain
ridges
the
deep
gorges
below
those
sullen
heights
looked
back
where
the
shadow
of
night
enfolded
them
but
all
along
the
road
the
silver
light
shone
full
and
clear
and
the
mountain
way
looked
like
a
path
through
fairyland
chapter
forty
years
after
a
horrid
day
said
lady
mary
throwing
down
her
book
with
a
yawn
and
looking
out
of
the
deep
bay
window
into
a
world
of
mountain
and
lake
which
was
clouded
over
by
a
dense
veil
of
rain
and
dull
grey
mist
such
rain
as
one
sees
only
in
a
lake
district
a
curtain
of
gloom
which
shuts
off
sky
and
distance
and
narrows
the
world
to
one
solitary
dwelling
suspended
amidst
cloud
and
water
like
another
ark
in
a
new
deluge
rain
such
rain
as
makes
exercise
impossible
was
always
an
affliction
to
lady
mary
haselden
her
delight
was
in
open
air
and
sunshine
fishing
in
the
lake
and
rivers
sitting
in
some
sheltered
hollow
of
the
hills
more
fitting
for
an
eagle
nest
than
for
the
occupation
of
a
young
lady
trying
to
paint
those
unpaintable
mountain
peaks
which
change
their
hues
with
every
change
of
the
sky
swimming
riding
roving
far
and
wide
over
hill
and
heather
pleasures
all
more
or
less
masculine
in
their
nature
and
which
were
a
subject
of
regret
with
lady
maulevrier
lady
lesbia
was
of
a
different
temper
she
loved
ease
and
elegance
the
gracious
luxuries
of
life
she
loved
art
and
music
but
not
to
labour
hard
at
either
she
played
and
sang
a
little
excellently
within
that
narrow
compass
which
she
had
allotted
to
herself
played
with
finished
touch
and
faultless
phrasing
sang
ballads
with
consummate
expression
she
painted
not
at
all
why
should
anyone
draw
or
paint
indifferently
she
asked
when
providence
has
furnished
the
world
with
so
many
great
painters
in
the
past
and
present
she
could
not
understand
mary
ardent
desire
to
do
the
thing
herself
to
be
able
with
her
own
pencil
and
her
own
brush
to
reproduce
the
lakes
and
valleys
the
wild
brown
hills
she
loved
so
passionately
lesbia
did
not
care
two
straws
for
the
lovely
lake
district
amidst
which
she
had
been
reared
every
pike
and
force
every
beck
and
gill
whereof
was
distinctly
dear
to
her
younger
sister
she
thought
it
a
very
hard
thing
to
have
spent
so
much
of
her
life
at
fellside
a
trial
that
would
have
hardly
been
endurable
if
it
were
not
for
grandmother
grandmother
and
lesbia
adored
each
other
lesbia
was
the
one
person
for
whom
lady
maulevrier
stateliness
was
subjugated
by
perfect
love
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
the
countess
was
marble
but
to
lesbia
she
was
wax
lesbia
could
mould
her
as
she
pleased
but
happily
lesbia
was
not
the
kind
of
young
person
to
take
advantage
of
this
privilege
she
was
thoroughly
ductile
or
docile
and
had
no
desire
at
present
which
ran
counter
to
her
grandmother
lesbia
was
a
beauty
in
her
nineteenth
year
she
was
a
curious
reproduction
in
face
and
figure
expression
and
carriage
of
that
lady
diana
angersthorpe
who
five
and
forty
years
ago
fluttered
the
of
james
and
mayfair
by
her
brilliant
beauty
and
her
keen
intelligence
there
in
the
panelled
at
fellside
hung
harlow
portrait
of
lady
diana
in
her
zenith
in
a
white
satin
frock
with
large
puffed
gauze
sleeves
through
which
the
perfect
arm
showed
dimly
standing
under
that
picture
lady
lesbia
looked
as
if
she
had
stepped
out
of
the
canvas
she
was
to
be
painted
by
millais
next
year
lady
maulevrier
said
when
she
had
been
introduced
and
society
was
beginning
to
talk
about
her
for
lady
maulevrier
made
up
her
mind
five
or
six
years
ago
that
lesbia
should
be
the
reigning
beauty
of
her
season
to
this
end
she
had
educated
and
trained
her
furnishing
her
with
all
those
graces
best
calculated
to
please
and
astonish
society
she
was
too
clever
a
woman
not
to
discover
lesbia
shallowness
and
lack
of
all
great
gifts
save
that
one
peerless
dower
of
perfect
beauty
she
knew
exactly
what
lesbia
could
be
trained
to
do
and
to
this
end
lesbia
had
been
educated
and
to
this
end
lady
maulevrier
brought
down
to
fellside
the
most
accomplished
of
hanoverian
governesses
who
had
learned
french
in
paris
and
had
toiled
in
the
educational
mill
with
profit
to
herself
and
her
pupils
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
to
this
lady
the
countess
entrusted
the
education
of
her
granddaughters
minds
while
for
their
physical
training
she
provided
another
teacher
in
the
person
of
a
clever
little
parisian
dancing
mistress
who
had
set
up
at
the
of
london
as
a
teacher
of
dancing
and
calisthenics
and
had
utterly
failed
to
find
pupils
enough
to
pay
her
rent
and
keep
her
modest
going
mademoiselle
thiebart
was
very
glad
to
exchange
the
uncertainties
of
a
first
floor
in
north
audley
street
for
the
comfort
and
security
of
fellside
manor
with
a
salary
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
both
fräulein
and
mademoiselle
had
been
quick
to
discover
that
lady
lesbia
was
the
apple
of
her
grandmother
eye
while
lady
mary
was
comparatively
an
outsider
so
it
came
about
that
mary
education
was
in
somewise
a
mere
of
the
crumbs
which
fell
from
lesbia
table
and
that
she
was
allowed
in
a
general
way
to
run
wild
she
was
much
quicker
at
any
intellectual
exercise
than
lesbia
she
learned
the
lessons
that
were
given
her
at
railroad
speed
and
rattled
off
her
exercises
with
a
penmanship
which
horrified
the
neat
and
niggling
fräulein
and
then
rushed
off
to
the
lake
or
mountain
and
by
this
means
grew
browner
and
browner
and
more
indelibly
freckled
day
by
day
thus
widening
the
gulf
between
herself
and
her
beauty
sister
but
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
because
lesbia
was
beautiful
mary
was
plain
this
is
very
far
from
the
truth
mary
had
splendid
hazel
eyes
with
a
dancing
light
in
them
when
she
smiled
ruddy
auburn
hair
white
teeth
a
chin
and
a
vivacity
and
archness
of
expression
which
served
only
in
her
present
state
of
tutelage
for
the
subjugation
of
old
women
and
shepherd
boys
mary
had
been
taught
to
believe
that
her
chances
of
future
promotion
were
of
the
smallest
that
nobody
would
ever
talk
of
her
or
think
of
her
when
she
in
her
turn
would
make
her
appearance
in
london
society
and
that
it
would
be
a
very
happy
thing
for
her
if
she
were
so
fortunate
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
fashionable
physician
a
canon
of
westminster
or
paul
or
a
barrister
in
good
practice
mary
turned
up
her
pert
little
nose
at
this
humdrum
lot
would
much
rather
spend
all
my
life
among
these
dear
hills
than
marry
a
nobody
in
london
she
said
fearless
of
that
grand
old
lady
at
whose
frown
so
many
people
shivered
you
do
think
people
will
like
me
and
admire
me
a
little
you
had
better
save
yourself
the
trouble
of
taking
me
to
london
i
do
want
to
play
second
fiddle
to
my
sister
are
a
very
impertinent
person
and
deserve
to
be
taken
at
your
word
replied
my
lady
scowling
at
her
i
have
no
doubt
before
you
are
twenty
you
will
tell
another
story
said
mary
now
just
turned
seventeen
i
am
not
to
come
out
till
i
am
twenty
will
be
soon
enough
answered
the
countess
will
take
you
as
long
to
get
rid
of
those
odious
freckles
and
no
doubt
by
that
time
lesbia
will
have
made
a
brilliant
marriage
and
now
on
this
rainy
july
morning
these
two
girls
neither
of
whom
had
any
serious
employment
for
her
life
or
any
serious
purpose
in
living
wasted
the
hours
each
in
her
own
fashion
lesbia
reclined
upon
a
cushioned
seat
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
a
tudor
window
her
perfection
it
was
one
of
many
such
attitudes
which
mademoiselle
had
taught
her
and
which
by
assiduous
training
had
become
a
second
nature
poor
mademoiselle
having
finished
her
mission
and
taught
lesbia
all
she
could
teach
had
now
departed
to
a
new
and
far
less
luxurious
situation
in
a
finishing
school
at
passy
but
fräulein
müller
was
still
retained
as
and
duenna
lesbia
pale
blue
morning
gown
harmonised
exquisitely
with
a
complexion
of
lilies
and
roses
violet
eyes
and
hair
her
features
were
distinguished
by
that
perfect
chiselling
which
gave
such
a
haughty
grace
to
her
grandmother
countenance
even
at
years
of
age
a
loveliness
which
like
the
sculptured
marble
it
resembles
is
unalterable
by
time
lesbia
was
reading
keats
it
was
her
habit
to
read
the
poets
carefully
and
deliberately
taking
up
one
at
a
time
and
duly
laying
a
volume
aside
when
she
found
herself
mistress
of
its
contents
she
had
no
passion
for
poetry
but
it
was
an
elegant
leisurely
kind
of
reading
which
suited
her
languid
temperament
moreover
her
grandmother
had
told
her
that
an
easy
familiarity
with
the
great
poets
is
of
all
knowledge
that
which
best
qualifies
a
woman
to
shine
in
conversation
without
offending
the
superior
sex
by
any
assumption
of
scholarship
mary
was
a
very
different
class
of
reader
capricious
omniverous
tearing
out
the
hearts
of
books
roaming
from
flower
to
flower
in
the
fields
of
literature
loving
old
and
new
romance
and
reality
novels
travels
plays
poetry
and
never
dwelling
long
on
any
one
theme
perhaps
if
mary
had
lived
in
the
bosom
of
a
particularly
sympathetic
family
she
might
have
been
reckoned
almost
a
genius
so
much
of
poetry
and
originality
was
there
in
her
free
unconventional
character
but
hitherto
it
had
been
mary
mission
in
life
to
be
snubbed
whereby
she
had
acquired
a
very
poor
opinion
of
her
own
talents
she
cried
with
a
desperate
yawn
while
lesbia
smiled
her
languid
smile
over
endymion
i
wished
something
would
happen
anything
to
stir
us
out
of
this
statuesque
state
of
being
i
verily
believe
the
spiders
are
all
asleep
in
the
ivy
and
the
mice
behind
the
wainscot
and
the
horses
in
the
stable
could
happen
asked
lesbia
with
a
gentle
elevation
of
pencilled
brows
not
these
lovely
lines
and
coverlids
like
the
peach
or
ripe
october
faded
marigolds
fell
sleek
about
him
in
a
thousand
folds
faded
marigolds
is
not
that
intensely
sweet
well
for
your
sleepy
keats
but
i
do
suppose
you
would
have
noticed
the
passage
if
marigolds
were
not
in
fashion
said
mary
with
a
touch
of
scorn
could
happen
why
a
hundred
things
an
earthquake
flood
or
fire
what
could
happen
do
you
say
lesbia
why
maulevrier
might
come
home
unexpectedly
and
charm
us
out
of
this
would
occasion
a
good
deal
of
unpleasantness
if
he
did
answered
lesbia
coldly
know
how
angry
he
has
made
grandmother
he
keeps
which
have
an
unlucky
knack
of
losing
said
mary
dubiously
suppose
if
his
horses
won
grandmother
would
rather
approve
at
all
that
would
make
hardly
any
difference
except
that
he
would
not
ruin
himself
quite
so
quickly
grandmother
says
that
a
young
man
who
goes
on
the
turf
is
sure
to
be
ruined
sooner
or
later
and
then
maulevrier
habits
are
altogether
wild
and
foolish
it
is
very
hard
upon
grandmother
who
has
such
noble
ambition
for
all
of
us
for
me
answered
mary
smiling
views
about
me
are
very
humble
she
considers
that
i
shall
be
most
fortunate
if
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
condescend
to
like
me
well
enough
to
make
me
an
offer
he
might
make
me
the
offer
without
liking
me
for
the
sake
of
hearing
himself
and
his
wife
announced
as
and
lady
mary
snooks
at
dinner
parties
that
would
be
too
horrid
but
i
daresay
such
things
have
happened
talk
nonsense
mary
said
lesbia
loftily
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
make
a
really
good
marriage
if
you
follow
grandmother
advice
and
do
affect
eccentricity
do
affect
eccentricity
but
i
afraid
i
really
am
eccentric
murmured
mary
meekly
i
like
so
many
things
i
ought
not
to
like
and
detest
so
many
things
which
i
ought
to
admire
daresay
you
will
have
tamed
down
a
little
before
you
are
presented
said
lesbia
carelessly
she
could
not
even
affect
a
profound
interest
in
anyone
but
herself
she
had
a
narrowness
of
mental
vision
which
prevented
her
looking
beyond
the
limited
circle
of
her
own
pleasures
her
own
desires
her
own
dreams
and
hopes
she
was
one
of
those
strictly
correct
young
women
who
was
not
likely
to
do
much
harm
in
the
world
but
who
was
just
as
unlikely
to
do
any
good
mary
sighed
and
went
back
to
her
book
a
bulky
volume
of
travels
and
tried
to
lose
herself
in
the
sandy
wastes
of
africa
and
to
be
deeply
interested
in
the
sources
of
the
congo
not
in
her
heart
of
hearts
caring
a
straw
whether
that
river
comes
from
the
mountains
of
the
moon
or
from
the
moon
itself
she
could
not
pin
her
mind
to
pages
which
might
have
interested
her
at
another
time
her
thoughts
were
with
lord
maulevrier
that
only
brother
just
seven
years
her
senior
who
had
taken
to
and
bad
ways
and
seemed
to
be
trying
his
hardest
to
dissipate
the
splendid
fortune
which
his
grandmother
the
dowager
countess
had
nursed
so
judiciously
during
his
long
minority
maulevrier
and
mary
had
always
been
what
the
young
man
called
end
of
chums
he
called
her
his
own
molly
much
to
the
annoyance
of
lady
maulevrier
and
lesbia
and
mary
life
was
all
gladness
when
maulevrier
was
at
fellside
she
devoted
herself
wholly
to
his
amusements
rode
and
drove
with
him
followed
on
her
pony
when
he
went
otter
hunting
and
very
often
abandoned
the
pony
to
the
care
of
some
stray
mountain
youth
in
order
to
join
the
hunters
and
go
leaping
from
stone
to
stone
on
the
margin
of
the
stream
and
occasionally
in
moments
of
wild
excitement
when
the
hounds
were
in
full
cry
splashing
in
and
out
of
the
water
like
a
naiad
in
a
neat
little
mary
looked
after
maulevrier
stable
when
he
was
away
and
had
supreme
command
of
a
kennel
of
which
cost
her
brother
more
money
than
the
countess
would
have
cared
to
know
for
in
the
wide
area
of
lady
maulevrier
ambition
there
was
no
room
for
two
hundred
guinea
were
they
never
so
perfect
altogether
mary
life
was
a
different
life
when
her
brother
was
at
home
and
in
his
absence
the
best
part
of
her
days
were
spent
in
thinking
about
him
and
fulfilling
the
duties
of
her
position
as
his
representative
in
stable
and
kennel
and
among
certain
rustics
in
the
district
chiefly
of
the
sporting
type
who
were
maulevrier
chosen
allies
or
never
perhaps
had
two
girls
of
patrician
lineage
lived
a
more
secluded
life
than
lady
maulevrier
granddaughters
they
had
known
no
pleasures
beyond
the
narrow
sphere
of
home
and
home
friends
they
had
never
travelled
they
had
seen
hardly
anything
of
the
outside
world
they
had
never
been
to
london
or
paris
or
to
any
city
larger
than
york
and
their
visits
to
that
centre
of
dissipation
had
been
of
the
briefest
a
mere
flash
of
mild
gaiety
a
horticultural
show
or
an
oratorio
and
back
by
express
train
closely
guarded
by
governess
and
footmen
to
fellside
in
the
autumn
when
the
leaves
were
falling
in
the
wooded
grounds
of
fellside
the
young
ladies
were
sent
still
under
guardianship
of
governesses
and
footmen
to
some
quiet
seaside
resort
between
alnwick
and
edinburgh
where
mary
lived
the
wild
free
life
she
loved
roaming
about
the
beach
boating
shrimping
making
hard
work
for
the
governesses
and
footmen
who
had
been
sent
in
charge
of
her
lady
maulevrier
never
accompanied
her
granddaughters
on
these
occasions
she
was
a
vigorous
old
woman
straight
as
a
dart
slim
as
a
girl
active
in
her
degree
as
any
young
athlete
among
those
hills
and
she
declared
that
she
never
felt
the
need
of
change
of
air
the
sodden
shrubberies
the
falling
leaves
did
her
no
harm
never
within
the
memory
of
this
generation
had
she
left
fellside
her
love
of
this
mountain
retreat
was
a
kind
of
she
had
come
here
broken
spirited
perhaps
broken
hearted
bringing
her
dead
husband
from
the
little
inn
at
great
langdale
forty
years
ago
and
she
had
hardly
left
the
spot
since
that
day
in
those
days
fellside
house
was
a
very
different
kind
of
dwelling
from
the
gracious
modern
tudor
mansion
which
now
crowned
and
beautified
the
above
grasmere
lake
it
was
then
an
old
rambling
stone
house
with
queer
little
rooms
and
inconvenient
passages
low
ceilings
thatched
gables
and
all
manner
of
strange
nooks
and
corners
lady
maulevrier
was
of
too
strictly
conservative
a
temper
to
think
of
pulling
down
an
old
house
which
had
been
in
her
husband
family
for
generations
she
left
the
original
cottage
undisturbed
and
built
her
new
house
at
right
angles
with
it
connecting
the
two
with
a
wide
passage
below
and
a
handsome
corridor
above
so
that
access
should
be
perfect
in
the
event
of
her
requiring
the
accommodation
of
the
old
quaint
low
ceiled
rooms
for
her
family
or
her
guests
during
forty
years
no
such
necessity
had
ever
arisen
but
the
old
house
known
as
the
south
wing
was
still
left
intact
the
original
furniture
undisturbed
although
the
only
occupants
of
the
building
were
her
ladyship
faithful
old
james
steadman
and
his
elderly
wife
the
house
which
lady
maulevrier
had
built
for
herself
and
her
grandchildren
had
not
been
created
all
at
once
though
the
nucleus
dating
forty
years
back
was
a
handsome
building
she
had
added
more
rooms
as
necessity
or
fancy
dictated
now
a
library
with
bedrooms
over
it
now
a
music
room
for
lady
lesbia
and
her
grand
piano
anon
a
as
an
agreeable
surprise
for
maulevrier
when
he
came
home
after
a
tour
in
america
thus
the
house
had
grown
into
a
long
low
pile
of
tudor
masonry
steep
gables
heavily
mullioned
casements
grey
stone
walls
curtained
with
the
rich
growth
of
magnolia
clematis
myrtle
and
roses
and
all
those
flowers
which
thrive
and
flourish
in
that
mild
and
sheltered
spot
the
views
from
those
mullioned
casements
were
perfect
switzerland
could
give
hardly
any
more
exquisite
picture
than
that
lake
shut
in
by
hills
grand
and
bold
in
their
varied
outlines
so
rich
in
their
colouring
that
the
eye
dazzled
with
beauty
forgot
to
calculate
the
actual
height
of
those
craggy
peaks
and
headlands
the
mind
forgot
to
despise
them
because
they
were
not
so
lofty
as
mont
blanc
or
the
matterhorn
the
velvet
sward
of
the
hill
sloped
steeply
downward
from
lady
windows
to
the
road
beside
the
lake
and
this
road
was
so
hidden
by
the
wooded
screen
which
bounded
her
ladyship
grounds
that
the
lake
seemed
to
lie
in
the
green
heart
of
her
gardens
a
lovely
placid
lake
on
summer
days
reflecting
the
emerald
hue
of
the
surrounding
hills
and
looking
like
a
smooth
green
meadow
which
invited
the
foot
passenger
to
cross
it
the
house
was
approached
by
a
winding
carriage
drive
that
led
up
and
up
and
up
from
the
road
beside
the
lake
so
screened
and
sheltered
by
shrubberies
and
pine
woods
that
the
stranger
knew
not
whither
he
was
going
till
he
came
upon
an
opening
in
the
wood
and
the
stately
italian
garden
in
front
of
a
massive
stone
porch
through
which
he
entered
a
spacious
hall
and
anon
descending
a
step
or
two
he
found
himself
in
lady
maulevrier
and
face
to
face
with
that
divine
view
of
the
everlasting
hills
the
lake
shining
below
him
bathed
in
sunlight
or
if
it
were
the
stranger
evil
fate
to
come
in
wet
weather
he
saw
only
a
landscape
the
blurred
outlines
of
grey
mountain
peaks
scowling
at
him
from
the
other
side
of
a
grey
pool
but
if
the
picture
without
were
depressing
the
picture
within
was
always
good
to
look
upon
for
those
or
tapestried
rooms
communicating
by
doorways
from
drawing
room
to
library
from
library
to
billiard
room
were
as
perfect
as
wealth
and
taste
could
make
them
lady
maulevrier
argued
that
as
there
was
but
one
house
among
all
the
possessions
of
her
race
which
she
cared
to
inhabit
she
had
a
right
to
make
that
house
beautiful
and
she
had
spared
nothing
upon
the
beautification
of
fellside
and
yet
she
had
spent
much
less
than
would
have
been
squandered
by
any
dowager
restlessly
roving
from
piccadilly
to
the
engadine
from
pontresina
to
nice
or
monaco
winding
up
with
easter
in
paris
and
then
back
to
piccadilly
her
ladyship
friends
wondered
that
she
could
care
to
bury
herself
alive
in
westmoreland
and
expatiated
on
the
eccentricity
of
such
a
life
nay
those
who
had
never
seen
fellside
argued
that
lady
maulevrier
had
taken
in
her
old
age
to
hoarding
and
that
she
pigged
at
a
cottage
in
the
lake
district
in
order
to
swell
a
fortune
which
young
maulevrier
would
set
about
squandering
as
soon
as
she
was
in
her
coffin
but
here
they
were
wrong
it
was
not
in
lady
maulevrier
nature
to
lead
a
sordid
life
in
order
to
save
money
yet
in
these
quiet
years
that
were
gone
starting
with
that
golden
nucleus
which
her
husband
was
supposed
to
have
brought
home
from
india
obtained
no
one
knows
how
the
countess
had
amassed
one
of
the
largest
fortunes
possessed
by
any
dowager
in
the
peerage
she
had
it
and
she
held
it
with
a
grasp
that
nothing
but
death
could
loosen
nay
that
mind
of
hers
might
contrive
to
cheat
grim
death
itself
and
to
scheme
a
way
for
protecting
this
wealth
even
when
she
who
had
gathered
and
garnered
it
should
be
mouldering
in
her
grave
the
entailed
estates
belonged
to
maulevrier
were
he
never
such
a
fool
or
spendthrift
but
this
fortune
of
the
dowager
was
her
own
to
dispose
of
as
she
pleased
and
not
a
penny
of
it
was
likely
to
go
to
the
young
earl
lady
maulevrier
pride
and
hopes
were
concentrated
upon
her
granddaughter
lesbia
she
should
be
the
inheritress
of
this
noble
fortune
she
should
spread
and
widen
the
power
of
the
maulevrier
race
lesbia
son
should
link
the
family
name
with
the
name
of
his
father
and
if
by
any
hazard
of
fate
the
present
earl
should
die
young
and
childless
the
old
countess
interest
should
be
strained
to
the
uttermost
to
obtain
the
title
for
lesbia
offspring
why
should
she
not
be
countess
of
maulevrier
in
her
own
right
but
in
order
to
make
this
future
possible
the
most
important
factor
in
the
sum
was
yet
to
be
found
in
the
person
of
a
husband
for
lady
lesbia
a
husband
worthy
of
peerless
beauty
and
exceptional
wealth
a
husband
whose
own
fortune
should
be
so
important
as
to
make
him
above
suspicion
that
was
lady
maulevrier
scheme
to
wed
wealth
to
wealth
to
double
or
quadruple
the
fortune
she
had
built
up
in
the
long
slow
years
of
her
widowhood
and
thus
to
make
her
granddaughter
one
of
the
greatest
ladies
in
the
land
for
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
the
man
who
was
to
wed
lady
lesbia
must
be
her
equal
in
wealth
and
lineage
if
not
her
superior
lady
maulevrier
was
not
a
miser
she
was
liberal
and
benevolent
to
all
who
came
within
the
circle
of
her
life
wealth
for
its
own
sake
she
valued
not
a
jot
but
she
lived
in
an
age
in
which
wealth
is
power
and
ambition
was
her
ruling
passion
as
she
had
been
ambitious
for
her
husband
in
the
days
that
were
gone
she
was
now
ambitious
for
her
granddaughter
time
had
intensified
the
keen
eagerness
of
her
mind
she
had
been
disappointed
cruelly
bitterly
in
the
ambition
of
her
youth
she
had
been
made
to
drink
the
cup
of
shame
and
humiliation
but
to
this
ambition
of
her
old
age
she
held
with
even
greater
tenacity
god
help
her
if
she
should
be
disappointed
here
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
so
astute
a
schemer
as
lady
maulevrier
had
not
surveyed
the
marriage
market
in
order
to
discover
that
fortunate
youth
who
should
be
deemed
worthy
to
become
the
winner
of
lesbia
hand
years
ago
when
lesbia
was
still
in
the
nursery
the
dowager
had
made
herself
informed
of
the
age
weight
and
colours
of
every
likely
runner
in
the
matrimonial
stakes
or
in
plainer
words
had
kept
herself
by
her
correspondence
with
a
few
intimate
friends
and
her
close
study
of
the
fashionable
newspapers
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
characters
and
exploits
the
dispositions
and
antecedents
of
those
elder
sons
among
whom
she
hoped
to
find
lesbia
lord
and
master
she
knew
her
peerage
by
heart
and
she
knew
the
family
history
of
every
house
recorded
therein
the
sins
and
weaknesses
the
follies
and
losses
of
bygone
years
the
taints
mental
and
physical
the
lateral
branches
and
intermarriages
the
runaway
wives
and
unfaithful
husbands
idiot
sons
or
scrofulous
daughters
she
knew
everything
that
was
to
be
known
about
that
aristocratic
world
into
which
she
had
been
born
years
ago
and
the
of
her
knowledge
was
that
there
was
one
man
whom
she
desired
for
her
granddaughter
husband
one
man
and
one
only
and
into
whose
hands
when
earth
and
sky
should
fade
from
her
glazing
eyes
she
could
be
content
to
resign
the
sceptre
of
power
there
were
no
doubt
or
more
in
the
list
of
elder
sons
who
were
fairly
eligible
but
this
young
man
was
the
achilles
in
the
rank
and
file
of
chivalry
and
her
soul
yearned
to
have
him
and
no
other
for
her
darling
her
soul
yearned
to
him
with
a
tenderness
which
was
not
all
on
account
years
ago
she
had
fondly
loved
his
father
loved
him
and
had
been
fain
to
renounce
him
for
ronald
hollister
afterwards
earl
of
hartfield
was
then
a
younger
son
and
the
two
families
had
agreed
that
marriage
between
paupers
was
an
impudent
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
which
must
be
put
down
with
an
iron
hand
lord
hartfield
sent
his
son
to
turkey
in
the
diplomatic
service
and
the
old
dowager
lady
carrisbrook
whisked
her
niece
off
to
london
and
kept
her
there
under
watch
and
ward
till
lord
maulevrier
proposed
and
was
accepted
by
her
there
should
be
no
foolishness
no
clandestine
correspondence
the
iron
hand
crushed
two
young
hearts
and
secured
a
brilliant
future
for
the
bodies
which
survived
fifteen
years
later
ronald
elder
brother
died
unmarried
he
abandoned
that
career
of
vagrant
diplomacy
which
had
taken
him
all
over
europe
and
as
far
as
washington
and
in
london
the
most
elegant
man
of
his
era
but
thoroughly
there
were
rumours
of
an
unhappy
attachment
in
the
faubourg
saint
germain
of
a
tragedy
at
petersburg
society
protested
that
lord
hartfield
would
die
a
bachelor
as
his
brother
died
before
him
the
hollisters
are
not
a
marrying
family
said
society
but
six
or
seven
years
after
his
return
to
england
lord
hartfield
married
lady
florence
ilmington
a
beauty
in
her
first
season
and
a
very
sweet
but
somewhat
prudish
young
person
the
marriage
resulted
in
the
birth
of
an
heir
whose
appearance
upon
this
mortal
stage
was
followed
within
a
year
by
his
father
exit
hence
the
hartfield
property
always
a
fine
estate
had
been
nursed
and
fattened
during
a
long
minority
and
the
present
lord
hartfield
was
reputed
one
of
the
richest
young
men
of
his
time
he
was
also
spoken
of
as
a
superior
person
inheriting
all
his
father
intellectual
gifts
and
having
the
reputation
of
being
singularly
free
from
the
vices
of
profligate
youth
he
was
neither
prig
nor
pedant
and
he
was
very
popular
in
the
best
society
but
he
was
not
ashamed
to
let
it
be
seen
that
his
ambition
soared
higher
than
the
fashionable
world
of
turf
and
stable
cards
and
pigeon
matches
though
not
of
the
gay
world
nor
in
it
lady
maulevrier
had
contrived
to
keep
herself
thoroughly
with
society
her
few
chosen
friends
with
whom
she
corresponded
on
terms
of
perfect
confidence
were
among
the
best
people
in
london
not
the
circulators
of
canards
the
of
gossip
from
the
society
papers
but
actors
in
the
comedy
of
high
life
arbiters
of
fashion
and
taste
born
and
bred
in
the
purple
last
season
lord
hartfield
absence
had
cast
a
cloud
over
the
matrimonial
horizon
he
had
been
a
traveller
for
more
than
a
year
patagonia
peru
the
pyramids
japan
the
north
pole
society
cared
not
where
the
fact
that
he
was
gone
was
bachelors
a
shade
less
eligible
came
to
the
front
in
his
absence
and
became
first
favourites
lady
maulevrier
well
informed
in
advance
had
deferred
lesbia
presentation
till
next
season
when
she
was
told
lord
hartfield
would
certainly
his
plans
had
been
made
for
return
before
christmas
and
it
would
seem
that
his
scheme
of
life
was
laid
down
with
as
much
precision
as
if
he
had
been
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
thus
it
happened
to
lesbia
intense
disgust
that
her
was
deferred
till
the
verge
of
her
twentieth
birthday
it
would
never
do
lady
maulevrier
told
herself
for
the
edge
to
be
taken
off
the
effect
which
lesbia
beauty
was
to
make
on
society
during
lord
hartfield
absence
he
must
be
there
on
the
spot
to
see
this
star
rise
gently
and
slowly
above
society
horizon
and
to
mark
how
everybody
bowed
down
and
worshipped
the
new
light
shall
be
an
old
woman
before
i
appear
in
society
said
lesbia
petulantly
i
shall
be
like
a
wild
woman
of
the
woods
for
i
have
seen
nothing
and
know
nothing
of
the
civilised
world
will
be
ever
so
much
more
attractive
than
the
young
women
i
hear
of
who
have
seen
and
known
a
great
deal
too
much
answered
the
dowager
and
as
her
granddaughter
knew
that
lady
maulevrier
word
was
a
law
that
altered
not
there
were
no
more
idle
repinings
her
ladyship
gave
no
reason
for
the
postponement
of
presentation
she
was
far
too
diplomatic
to
breathe
a
word
of
her
ideas
with
regard
to
lord
hartfield
anything
like
a
matrimonial
scheme
would
have
been
revolting
to
lesbia
who
had
grand
but
not
sordid
views
about
matrimony
she
thought
it
her
mission
to
appear
and
to
conquer
a
crowd
of
suitors
would
sigh
around
her
like
the
loves
and
graces
round
that
fair
belinda
whose
story
she
had
read
so
often
and
it
would
be
her
part
to
choose
the
most
worthy
the
days
are
gone
when
a
girl
would
so
much
as
look
at
such
a
fribble
as
sir
plume
her
virgin
fancy
demands
the
tennysonian
ideal
the
grave
and
knightly
arthur
but
when
lesbia
thought
of
the
most
worthy
it
was
always
of
the
worthiest
in
her
own
particular
sphere
and
he
of
course
would
be
titled
and
wealthy
and
altogether
fitted
to
be
her
husband
he
would
take
her
by
the
hand
and
lead
her
to
a
higher
seat
on
the
dais
and
place
upon
her
head
or
at
least
upon
her
and
the
panels
of
her
carriage
a
coronet
in
which
the
strawberry
leaves
should
stand
out
more
prominently
than
in
her
brother
emblazonment
lesbia
mind
could
not
conceive
an
ignoble
marriage
or
the
possibility
of
the
most
worthy
happening
to
be
found
in
a
lower
circle
than
her
own
and
now
it
was
the
end
of
july
and
the
season
which
should
have
been
glorified
by
lady
lesbia
was
over
and
done
with
she
had
read
in
the
society
papers
of
all
the
balls
and
birthdays
and
race
meetings
and
regattas
and
cricket
matches
and
gowns
and
parasols
and
bonnets
what
this
beauty
wore
on
such
an
occasion
and
how
that
other
beauty
looked
on
another
occasion
and
she
felt
as
she
read
like
a
princess
in
a
fairy
tale
mewed
up
in
a
battlemented
tower
and
deprived
of
her
legitimate
share
in
all
the
pleasures
of
earth
she
had
no
patience
with
mary
that
wild
unkempt
ungraceful
creature
who
could
be
as
happy
as
summer
days
are
long
racing
about
the
hills
with
her
bamboo
alpenstock
rioting
with
a
pack
of
practising
long
losers
rowing
on
the
lake
doing
all
things
unbecoming
lady
maulevrier
granddaughter
that
long
rainy
day
dragged
its
slow
length
to
a
close
and
then
came
fine
days
in
which
molly
and
her
went
wandering
over
the
sunlit
hills
skipping
and
dancing
across
the
mountain
streamlets
gills
as
they
were
called
in
this
particular
world
almost
as
gaily
as
the
shadows
of
fleecy
cloudlets
dancing
up
yonder
in
the
windy
sky
molly
spent
half
her
days
among
the
hills
stealing
off
from
governess
and
grandmother
and
the
stately
beauty
sister
and
sometimes
hardly
being
missed
by
them
so
ill
did
her
young
exuberance
harmonise
with
their
calmer
life
can
tell
when
mary
is
at
home
by
a
perpetual
banging
of
doors
said
lesbia
which
was
a
sisterly
exaggeration
founded
upon
fact
for
molly
was
given
to
impetuous
rushing
in
and
out
of
rooms
when
that
eager
spirit
of
hers
impelled
the
light
lithe
body
upon
some
new
expedition
nor
is
the
society
of
conducive
to
repose
or
stateliness
of
movement
and
maulevrier
terriers
although
strictly
forbidden
the
house
were
for
ever
breaking
bonds
and
leaping
in
upon
retirement
at
all
unreasonable
hours
she
and
they
were
enchanted
to
get
away
from
the
beautiful
luxurious
rooms
and
to
go
roving
by
and
force
away
to
easedale
tarn
to
bask
for
hours
on
the
grassy
margin
of
the
deep
still
water
or
to
row
round
and
round
the
mountain
lake
in
a
rotten
boat
it
was
here
or
in
some
kindred
spot
that
molly
got
through
most
of
her
reading
here
that
she
read
shakespeare
byron
and
shelley
and
wordsworth
dwelling
lingeringly
and
lovingly
upon
every
line
in
which
that
good
old
man
spoke
of
her
native
land
sometimes
she
climbed
to
higher
ground
and
felt
herself
ever
so
much
nearer
heaven
upon
the
crest
of
silver
howe
or
upon
the
rugged
stony
steep
of
dolly
waggon
pike
half
way
up
the
dark
brow
of
helvellyn
sometimes
she
disappeared
for
hours
and
climbed
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
wandered
in
perilous
pathways
on
striding
edge
or
by
the
dark
still
water
of
the
red
tarn
this
had
been
her
life
ever
since
she
had
been
old
enough
to
have
an
independent
existence
and
the
hills
and
the
lakes
and
the
books
of
her
own
choosing
had
done
a
great
deal
more
in
ripening
her
mind
than
fräulein
müller
and
that
admirable
series
of
educational
works
which
has
been
provided
for
the
tuition
of
modern
youth
grammars
and
geographies
primers
and
elementary
works
of
all
kinds
were
mary
detestation
but
she
loved
books
that
touched
her
heart
and
filled
her
mind
with
thoughts
wide
and
deep
enough
to
reach
into
the
infinite
of
time
and
space
the
mystery
of
mind
and
matter
life
and
death
nothing
occurred
to
break
the
placid
monotony
of
life
at
fellside
for
three
long
days
after
that
rainy
morning
and
then
came
an
event
which
although
commonplace
enough
in
itself
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
the
existence
of
lady
maulevrier
granddaughters
it
was
evening
and
the
two
girls
were
dawdling
about
on
the
sloping
lawn
before
the
windows
where
lady
maulevrier
read
the
newspapers
in
her
own
particular
chair
by
one
of
those
broad
tudor
windows
according
to
her
infallible
custom
remote
as
her
life
had
been
from
the
busy
world
her
ladyship
had
never
allowed
her
knowledge
of
public
life
and
the
bent
of
modern
thought
to
fall
into
arrear
she
took
a
keen
interest
in
politics
in
progress
of
all
kinds
she
was
a
staunch
conservative
and
looked
upon
every
liberal
politician
as
her
personal
enemy
but
she
took
care
to
keep
herself
informed
of
everything
that
was
being
said
or
done
in
the
enemy
camp
she
had
an
intense
respect
for
lord
bacon
maxim
knowledge
is
power
it
was
a
kind
of
power
secondary
to
the
power
of
wealth
perhaps
but
wealth
unprotected
by
wisdom
would
soon
dwindle
into
poverty
lady
lesbia
sauntered
about
the
lawn
looking
very
elegant
in
her
indian
silk
gown
very
listless
very
tired
of
her
lovely
surroundings
neither
lake
nor
mountain
possessed
any
charm
for
her
she
had
had
too
much
of
them
mary
roamed
about
with
a
swifter
footstep
looking
at
the
roses
plucking
off
a
dead
leaf
or
a
cankered
bud
here
and
there
presently
she
tore
across
the
lawn
to
the
shrubbery
which
screened
the
lawn
and
flower
gardens
from
the
winding
carriage
drive
sunk
many
feet
below
and
disappeared
in
a
thicket
of
arbutus
and
irish
yew
terribly
hoydenish
manners
murmured
lesbia
with
a
languid
shrug
of
her
shoulders
as
she
strolled
back
to
the
she
cared
very
little
for
the
newspapers
for
politics
not
at
all
but
anything
was
better
than
everlasting
contemplation
of
the
blue
still
water
and
the
rugged
crest
of
helm
crag
was
the
matter
with
mary
that
she
rushed
off
like
a
mad
woman
inquired
lady
maulevrier
looking
up
from
the
have
the
least
idea
mary
movements
are
quite
beyond
the
limits
of
my
comprehension
perhaps
she
has
gone
after
a
mary
was
intent
upon
no
her
quick
ear
had
caught
the
sound
of
manly
voices
in
the
winding
drive
under
the
pine
wood
and
surely
yes
surely
one
was
a
clear
and
familiar
voice
which
heralded
the
coming
of
happiness
in
such
a
moment
she
seemed
to
have
wings
she
became
unconscious
that
she
touched
the
earth
she
went
skimming
over
the
lawn
and
in
and
out
with
fluttering
muslin
frock
among
arbutus
and
bay
yew
and
laurel
till
she
stood
poised
lightly
on
the
top
of
the
wooded
bank
which
bordered
the
steep
ascent
to
lady
maulevrier
gate
looking
down
at
two
figures
which
were
sauntering
up
the
drive
they
were
both
young
men
both
tall
manly
walking
with
the
easy
swinging
movement
of
men
accustomed
to
active
exercise
one
the
handsomer
of
the
two
in
mary
eyes
since
she
thought
him
simply
perfection
was
the
typical
saxon
this
was
lord
maulevrier
the
other
was
dark
bronzed
by
foreign
travel
perhaps
with
black
hair
cut
very
close
to
an
head
bared
to
the
evening
breeze
cried
maulevrier
molly
how
d
do
old
girl
the
two
men
looked
up
and
molly
looked
down
delight
at
her
return
so
filled
her
heart
and
mind
that
there
was
no
room
left
for
embarrassment
at
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
maulevrier
i
am
so
glad
i
have
been
pining
for
you
why
did
you
write
to
say
you
were
coming
it
would
have
been
something
to
look
forward
to
never
knew
from
day
to
day
what
i
was
going
to
be
up
to
besides
i
knew
i
should
find
you
at
home
course
we
are
always
at
home
said
mary
up
to
the
house
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
i
go
and
tell
grandmother
tell
them
to
get
us
some
dinner
said
maulevrier
mary
fluttering
figure
dipped
and
was
gone
vanishing
in
the
dark
labyrinth
of
shrubs
the
two
young
men
sauntered
up
to
the
house
need
hurry
said
maulevrier
to
his
companion
whom
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
introduce
to
his
sister
shall
have
to
wait
for
our
dinner
we
shall
have
to
change
our
dusty
clothes
added
the
other
hope
that
man
will
bring
our
portmanteaux
in
time
we
need
dress
we
can
spend
the
evening
in
my
den
if
you
like
mary
flew
across
the
lawn
again
and
bounded
up
the
steps
of
the
verandah
a
picturesque
swiss
verandah
which
made
a
covered
promenade
in
front
of
the
house
may
i
ask
the
meaning
of
this
excitement
inquired
her
ladyship
as
the
breathless
girl
stood
before
her
has
come
home
last
he
has
brought
a
friend
he
might
have
done
me
the
honour
to
inquire
if
his
visit
would
be
agreeable
what
kind
of
person
have
no
idea
i
did
look
at
him
maulevrier
is
looking
so
well
they
will
be
here
in
a
minute
may
i
order
dinner
for
them
course
they
must
have
dinner
said
her
ladyship
resignedly
as
if
the
whole
thing
were
an
infliction
and
mary
ran
out
and
interviewed
the
butler
begging
that
all
things
might
be
made
particularly
comfortable
for
the
travellers
it
was
nine
and
the
servants
were
enjoying
their
eventide
repose
having
given
her
orders
mary
went
back
to
the
impatiently
expectant
of
her
brother
arrival
for
which
event
lesbia
and
her
grandmother
waited
with
perfect
tranquillity
the
dowager
calmly
continuing
the
perusal
of
her
while
lesbia
sat
at
her
piano
in
a
shadowy
corner
and
played
one
of
mendelssohn
softest
lieder
to
these
dreamy
strains
maulevrier
and
his
friend
presently
entered
d
do
grandmother
how
do
lesbia
this
is
my
very
good
friend
and
canadian
travelling
companion
jack
hammond
lady
maulevrier
lady
lesbia
glad
to
see
you
hammond
said
the
dowager
in
a
tone
so
purely
conventional
that
it
might
mean
anything
i
ought
to
remember
your
family
the
hammonds
of
nowhere
answered
the
stranger
in
the
easiest
tone
spring
from
a
race
of
nobodies
of
whose
existence
your
ladyship
is
not
likely
to
have
heard
chapter
vi
maulevrier
humble
friend
that
faint
interest
which
lady
lesbia
had
felt
in
the
advent
of
a
stranger
dwindled
to
nothing
after
hammond
frank
avowal
of
his
insignificance
at
the
very
beginning
of
her
career
with
the
world
waiting
to
be
conquered
by
her
a
beauty
could
not
be
expected
to
feel
any
interest
in
nobodies
lesbia
shook
hands
with
her
brother
honoured
the
stranger
with
a
stately
bend
of
her
beautiful
throat
and
then
withdrew
herself
from
their
society
altogether
as
it
were
and
began
to
explore
her
basket
of
crewels
at
a
distant
table
by
the
soft
light
of
a
shaded
lamp
while
maulevrier
answered
his
questions
and
mary
stood
watching
him
hanging
on
his
words
as
if
unconscious
of
any
other
presence
hammond
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
view
the
moon
was
rising
above
the
amphitheatre
of
hills
and
her
rays
were
silvering
the
placid
bosom
of
the
lake
lights
were
dotted
here
and
there
about
the
valley
telling
of
village
life
the
prince
of
wales
hotel
yonder
sparkled
with
its
many
lights
like
a
castle
in
a
fairy
tale
the
stranger
had
looked
upon
many
a
grander
scene
but
on
none
more
lovely
here
were
lake
and
mountain
in
little
without
the
and
awful
inaccessible
regions
of
solitude
and
peril
homely
hills
that
one
might
climb
placid
english
vales
in
which
english
poets
have
lived
and
died
and
i
mean
to
spend
a
month
or
six
weeks
with
you
if
you
can
make
us
comfortable
said
maulevrier
am
delighted
to
hear
that
you
can
contemplate
staying
a
month
anywhere
replied
her
ladyship
usual
habits
are
as
restless
as
if
your
life
were
a
disease
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
if
you
and
hammond
are
uncomfortable
at
fellside
there
was
courtesy
but
no
cordiality
in
the
reply
if
hammond
was
a
sensitive
man
touchily
conscious
of
his
own
obscurity
he
must
have
felt
that
he
was
not
wanted
at
fellside
that
he
was
an
excrescence
matter
in
the
wrong
place
nobody
had
presented
the
stranger
to
lady
mary
it
never
entered
into
maulevrier
mind
to
be
ceremonious
about
his
sister
molly
she
was
so
much
a
part
of
himself
that
it
seemed
as
if
anyone
who
knew
him
must
needs
know
her
molly
sat
a
little
way
from
the
window
by
which
hammond
was
standing
and
looked
at
him
doubtfully
wonderingly
with
not
altogether
a
friendly
eye
as
he
stood
with
his
profile
turned
to
her
and
his
eyes
upon
the
landscape
she
was
inclined
to
be
jealous
of
her
brother
friend
who
would
most
likely
deprive
her
of
much
of
that
beloved
society
hitherto
she
had
been
maulevrier
chosen
companion
at
fellside
indeed
his
sole
companion
after
the
dismissal
of
his
tutor
now
this
brown
bearded
stranger
would
usurp
her
privileges
those
two
young
men
would
go
roaming
over
the
hills
fishing
going
to
distant
wrestling
matches
and
leaving
her
at
home
it
was
a
hard
thing
and
she
was
prepared
to
detest
the
interloper
even
she
would
be
a
loser
by
his
presence
under
ordinary
circumstances
she
would
have
gone
to
the
with
maulevrier
and
sat
by
him
and
waited
upon
him
as
he
ate
but
she
dared
not
intrude
herself
upon
a
meal
that
was
to
be
shared
with
a
stranger
she
looked
at
john
hammond
critically
eager
to
find
fault
with
his
appearence
but
unluckily
for
her
present
humour
there
was
not
much
room
for
he
was
tall
his
enemies
would
hardly
deny
that
he
was
nay
even
handsome
the
massive
regular
features
were
irreproachable
he
was
more
sunburnt
than
a
gentleman
ought
to
be
mary
thought
she
told
herself
that
his
good
looks
were
of
a
vulgar
quality
like
those
of
charles
ford
the
champion
wrestler
whom
she
saw
at
the
sports
the
other
day
why
did
maulevrier
pick
up
a
companion
who
was
evidently
not
of
his
own
sphere
hoydenish
frank
and
affectionate
as
mary
haselden
was
she
knew
that
she
belonged
to
a
race
apart
that
there
were
circles
beneath
circles
below
her
own
world
circles
which
hers
could
never
touch
and
she
supposed
hammond
to
be
some
waif
from
one
of
those
nethermost
worlds
a
village
doctor
son
perhaps
or
even
a
tradesman
sent
to
the
university
by
some
benevolent
busybody
and
placed
at
a
disadvantage
ever
afterwards
an
unfortunate
anomaly
suspended
between
two
worlds
like
mahomet
coffin
the
butler
announced
that
his
lordship
dinner
was
served
along
molly
said
maulevrier
and
tell
me
about
the
terriers
while
i
eat
my
dinner
mary
hesitated
glanced
doubtfully
at
her
grandmother
who
made
no
sign
and
then
slipped
out
of
the
room
hanging
fondly
on
her
brother
arm
and
almost
forgetting
that
there
was
any
such
person
as
hammond
in
existence
when
these
three
were
gone
lady
lesbia
expressed
herself
strongly
upon
maulevrier
folly
in
bringing
such
a
person
as
hammond
to
fellside
are
we
to
do
with
him
grandmother
she
said
pettishly
he
to
live
with
us
and
be
one
of
us
a
person
of
whose
belongings
we
know
positively
nothing
who
owns
that
his
people
are
common
dear
he
is
your
brother
friend
and
we
have
the
right
to
suppose
he
is
a
gentleman
on
that
account
said
lesbia
more
sharply
than
her
wont
he
make
a
friend
or
almost
a
friend
of
jack
howell
the
huntsman
and
of
ford
the
wrestler
i
have
no
confidence
in
maulevrier
ideas
of
fitness
shall
find
out
all
about
this
hamleigh
no
hammond
in
a
day
or
two
replied
her
ladyship
placidly
in
the
meantime
we
must
tolerate
him
and
be
grateful
to
him
if
he
reconcile
maulevrier
to
remaining
at
fellside
for
the
next
six
weeks
lesbia
was
silent
she
did
not
consider
maulevrier
presence
at
fellside
an
unmitigated
advantage
or
indeed
his
presence
anywhere
those
two
were
not
sympathetic
maulevrier
made
fun
of
his
elder
sister
perfections
chaffed
her
intolerably
about
the
great
man
she
was
going
to
captivate
in
her
first
season
the
great
houses
in
which
she
was
going
to
reign
lesbia
despised
him
for
that
neglect
of
all
his
opportunities
of
culture
which
had
left
him
after
the
most
orthodox
and
costly
curriculum
almost
as
ignorant
as
a
ploughboy
she
despised
a
man
whose
only
delight
was
in
horse
and
hound
gun
and
molly
would
have
cared
very
little
for
the
guns
or
the
perhaps
in
the
abstract
but
she
cared
for
everything
that
interested
maulevrier
even
to
the
bagful
of
rats
which
were
let
loose
in
the
sometimes
for
the
education
of
a
particularly
game
there
was
plenty
of
talk
and
laughter
at
the
while
the
countess
and
lady
lesbia
conversed
gravely
and
languidly
in
the
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
both
travellers
were
ravenous
they
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
and
had
driven
from
windermere
on
the
top
of
the
coach
in
the
keen
evening
air
when
the
sharp
edge
of
the
appetite
was
blunted
maulevrier
began
to
talk
of
his
adventures
since
he
and
molly
had
last
met
he
had
not
being
dissipating
in
london
all
the
time
or
indeed
any
great
part
of
the
time
of
his
absence
from
fellside
but
molly
had
been
left
in
cimmerian
darkness
as
to
his
proceedings
he
never
wrote
a
letter
if
he
could
possibly
avoid
doing
so
if
it
became
a
vital
necessity
to
him
to
communicate
with
anyone
he
telegraphed
or
in
his
own
language
to
that
person
but
to
sit
down
at
a
desk
and
labour
with
pen
and
ink
was
not
within
his
capacities
or
his
views
of
his
mission
in
life
a
fellow
is
to
write
letters
he
might
as
well
be
a
clerk
in
an
office
he
said
sit
on
a
high
stool
thus
it
happened
that
when
maulevrier
was
away
from
fellside
no
fair
of
the
middle
ages
could
be
more
ignorant
of
the
movements
or
whereabouts
of
her
crusader
knight
than
mary
was
of
her
goings
on
she
could
but
pray
for
him
with
fond
and
faithful
prayer
and
wait
and
hope
for
his
return
and
now
he
told
her
that
things
had
gone
badly
with
him
at
epsom
and
worse
at
ascot
that
he
had
been
as
he
expressed
it
a
tree
and
that
he
had
gone
off
to
the
black
forest
directly
the
ascot
week
was
over
and
at
rippoldsau
he
had
met
his
old
friend
and
fellow
traveller
hammond
and
they
had
gone
for
a
walking
tour
together
among
the
homely
villages
the
watchmakers
the
timber
cutters
the
pretty
peasant
girls
they
had
danced
at
fairs
and
shot
at
village
sports
and
had
altogether
enjoyed
the
thing
hammond
who
was
something
of
an
artist
had
sketched
a
good
deal
maulevrier
had
done
nothing
but
smoke
his
german
pipe
and
enjoy
himself
was
glad
to
find
myself
in
a
world
where
a
horse
was
an
exception
and
not
the
rule
he
said
how
i
should
love
to
see
the
black
forest
cried
mary
who
knew
the
first
part
of
faust
by
heart
albeit
she
had
never
been
given
permission
to
read
it
gnomes
and
the
witches
der
freischütz
all
that
is
lovely
of
course
you
went
up
the
brocken
course
answered
hammond
was
our
de
and
we
went
up
among
a
company
of
witches
riding
on
broomsticks
and
then
quoted
die
bäume
hinter
bäumen
wie
sie
schnell
vorüberrücken
und
die
klippen
die
sich
bücken
und
die

this
was
the
first
time
he
had
addressed
himself
directly
to
mary
who
sat
close
to
her
brother
side
and
never
took
her
eyes
from
his
face
ready
to
pour
out
his
wine
or
to
change
his
plate
for
the
had
been
dismissed
at
the
beginning
of
this
unceremonious
meal
mary
looked
at
the
stranger
almost
as
superciliously
as
lesbia
might
have
done
she
was
not
inclined
to
be
friendly
to
her
brother
friend
you
read
german
she
inquired
with
a
touch
of
surprise
had
better
ask
him
what
language
he
does
not
read
or
speak
said
her
brother
is
an
admirable
crichton
my
dear
who
was
admirable
crichton
knows
everything
can
twist
your
little
head
the
right
way
upon
any
subject
thought
mary
cultivated
is
he
very
proper
in
a
man
who
was
educated
on
charity
to
have
worked
his
hardest
at
the
university
she
was
not
prepared
to
think
very
kindly
of
young
men
who
had
been
successful
in
their
college
career
since
poor
maulevrier
had
made
such
a
dismal
failure
of
his
had
been
gated
and
sent
down
and
ploughed
and
had
everything
ignominious
done
to
him
that
could
be
done
which
ignominy
had
involved
an
expenditure
of
money
that
lady
maulevrier
bemoaned
and
lamented
until
this
day
because
her
brother
had
not
been
virtuous
mary
grudged
virtuous
young
men
their
triumphs
and
their
honours
great
fellows
who
have
taken
their
degrees
at
scotch
universities
come
to
oxford
and
cambridge
and
sweep
the
board
maulevrier
had
told
her
when
his
own
failures
demanded
explanation
perhaps
this
hammond
had
graduated
north
of
the
tweed
and
had
come
southward
to
rob
the
native
mary
was
not
any
more
inclined
to
be
civil
to
him
because
he
was
a
linguist
he
had
a
pleasant
manner
frank
and
easy
a
good
voice
a
cheery
laugh
but
she
had
not
yet
made
up
her
mind
that
he
was
a
gentleman
some
benevolent
old
person
were
to
take
a
fancy
to
charles
ford
the
wrestler
and
send
him
to
a
scotch
university
i
daresay
he
would
turn
out
just
as
fine
a
fellow
she
thought
ford
being
somewhat
of
a
favourite
as
a
local
hero
the
two
young
men
went
off
to
the
after
they
had
dined
it
was
ten
by
this
time
and
of
course
mary
did
not
go
with
them
she
bade
her
brother
at
the
door
molly
be
sure
you
are
up
early
to
show
me
the
dogs
said
maulevrier
after
an
affectionate
kiss
lady
mary
said
hammond
holding
out
his
hand
albeit
she
had
no
idea
of
shaking
hands
with
him
she
allowed
her
hand
to
rest
for
an
instant
in
that
strong
friendly
grasp
she
had
not
risen
to
giving
a
couple
of
fingers
to
a
person
whom
she
considered
her
inferior
but
she
was
inclined
to
snub
hammond
as
rather
a
presuming
young
man
jack
what
do
you
think
of
my
beauty
sister
asked
his
lordship
as
he
chose
his
cue
from
the
rack
the
lamps
were
lighted
the
table
uncovered
and
ready
carambole
in
his
place
albeit
it
was
months
since
any
player
had
entered
the
room
everything
which
concerned
maulevrier
comfort
or
pleasure
was
done
as
if
by
magic
at
fellside
and
mary
was
the
household
fairy
whose
influence
secured
this
happy
state
of
things
can
any
man
think
except
that
she
is
as
lovely
as
the
finest
of
reynold
portraits
as
that
lady
diana
beauclerk
of
colonel
aldridge
or
the
kitty
fisher
or
any
example
you
please
to
name
of
womanly
loveliness
to
hear
it
answered
maulevrier
chalking
his
cue
say
i
admire
her
myself
not
my
style
do
you
know
too
much
of
my
lady
di
too
little
of
poor
kitty
but
still
of
course
it
always
pleases
a
fellow
to
know
that
his
people
are
admired
and
i
know
that
my
grandmother
has
views
grand
views
smiling
down
at
his
cue
i
break
and
he
began
with
the
usual
miss
in
baulk
you
said
hammond
beginning
to
play
views
of
course
very
natural
that
her
ladyship
should
expect
such
a
lovely
creature
to
make
a
great
match
is
there
no
one
in
view
has
there
been
no
family
conclave
no
secret
treaty
is
the
young
lady
fancy
free
she
has
been
buried
alive
here
except
parsons
and
a
few
decent
people
whom
she
is
allowed
to
meet
now
and
then
at
the
houses
about
here
she
has
seen
nothing
of
the
world
my
grandmother
has
kept
lesbia
as
close
as
a
nun
she
is
not
so
fond
of
molly
and
that
young
person
has
wild
ways
of
her
own
and
gives
everybody
the
slip
how
do
you
like
my
little
moll
the
adjective
was
hardly
accurate
about
a
young
lady
who
measured
five
feet
six
but
maulevrier
had
not
yet
grown
out
of
the
ideas
belonging
to
that
period
when
mary
was
really
his
little
sister
a
girl
of
twelve
with
long
hair
and
short
petticoats
hammond
was
slow
to
reply
mary
had
not
made
a
very
strong
impression
upon
him
dazzled
by
her
sister
pure
and
classical
beauty
he
had
no
eyes
for
mary
homelier
charms
she
seemed
to
him
a
frank
affectionate
girl
not
too
and
that
was
all
he
thought
of
her
afraid
lady
mary
does
not
like
me
he
said
after
his
shot
which
gave
him
time
for
reflection
molly
is
rather
in
her
manners
never
would
train
fine
do
you
know
her
ladyship
lectured
till
she
was
tired
and
now
mary
runs
wild
and
i
suppose
will
be
left
at
grass
till
six
months
before
her
presentation
and
then
they
put
her
on
the
a
bit
to
give
her
a
better
mouth
good
shot
by
jove
john
hammond
was
used
to
his
lordship
style
of
conversation
and
understood
his
friend
at
all
times
maulevrier
was
not
an
intellectual
companion
and
the
distance
was
wide
between
the
two
men
but
his
lordship
gaiety
and
acuteness
made
amends
for
all
shortcomings
in
culture
and
then
hammond
may
have
been
one
of
those
good
conservatives
who
do
not
expect
very
much
intellectual
power
in
an
hereditary
legislator
chapter
vii
in
the
summer
morning
john
hammond
loved
the
wild
freshness
of
morning
and
was
always
eager
to
explore
a
new
locality
so
he
was
up
at
five
next
morning
and
out
of
doors
before
six
he
left
the
sophisticated
beauty
of
the
fellside
gardens
below
him
and
climbed
higher
and
higher
up
the
fell
till
he
was
able
to
command
a
view
of
the
lake
and
village
and
just
under
his
feet
as
it
were
lady
maulevrier
favourite
abode
he
was
provided
with
a
landscape
glass
which
he
always
carried
in
his
rambles
and
with
the
aid
of
this
he
could
see
every
stone
of
the
building
the
house
added
to
at
her
ladyship
pleasure
and
without
regard
to
cost
covered
a
considerable
extent
of
ground
the
new
part
consisted
of
a
straight
range
of
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
feet
facing
the
lake
and
commandingly
placed
on
the
crest
of
a
steepish
slope
the
old
buildings
at
right
angles
with
the
new
made
a
quadrangle
the
third
and
fourth
sides
of
which
were
formed
by
the
dead
walls
of
rooms
and
which
had
no
windows
upon
this
inner
enclosed
side
the
old
buildings
were
low
and
irregular
one
portion
of
the
roof
thatched
another
tiled
in
the
quadrangle
there
was
an
garden
with
geometrical
a
yew
tree
hedge
and
a
stone
in
the
centre
a
peacock
stalked
about
in
the
morning
light
and
greeted
the
newly
risen
sun
with
a
discordant
scream
presently
a
man
came
out
of
a
half
glass
door
under
a
verandah
which
shaded
one
side
of
the
quadrangle
and
strolled
about
the
garden
stopping
here
and
there
to
cut
a
dead
rose
or
trim
a
geranium
a
broad
shouldered
man
with
gray
hair
and
beard
the
image
of
respectability
hammond
wondered
a
little
at
the
man
leisurely
movements
as
he
sauntered
about
whistling
to
the
peacock
it
was
not
the
manner
of
a
servant
who
had
duties
to
perform
rather
that
of
a
gentleman
living
at
ease
and
hardly
knowing
how
to
get
rid
of
his
time
some
superior
functionary
i
suppose
thought
hammond
the
perhaps
he
rambled
a
long
way
over
the
hill
and
came
back
to
fellside
by
a
path
of
his
own
discovering
which
brought
him
to
a
wooden
gate
leading
into
the
just
in
time
to
meet
maulevrier
and
lady
mary
emerging
from
the
kennel
where
his
lordship
had
been
inspecting
the
terriers
is
bully
about
the
muzzle
said
maulevrier
shall
have
to
give
her
away
do
cried
mary
is
a
most
perfect
darling
and
laughs
so
deliciously
whenever
she
sees
me
angelina
was
in
lady
mary
arms
at
this
moment
a
beautifully
marked
little
creature
all
thew
and
sinew
palpitating
with
suppressed
emotions
and
grinning
to
her
heart
content
lady
mary
looked
very
fresh
and
bright
in
her
neat
tailor
gown
kilted
kirtle
and
bodice
with
neat
little
brass
buttons
it
was
a
gown
of
maulevrier
ordering
made
at
his
own
tailor
her
splendid
chestnut
hair
was
uncovered
the
short
crisp
curls
about
her
forehead
dancing
in
the
morning
air
her
large
bright
brown
eyes
were
dancing
too
with
delight
at
having
her
brother
home
again
she
shook
hands
with
hammond
more
graciously
than
last
night
but
still
with
a
carelessness
which
was
not
complimentary
looking
at
him
absently
as
if
she
hardly
knew
that
he
was
there
and
hugging
angelina
all
the
time
hammond
told
his
friend
about
his
ramble
over
the
hills
yonder
up
above
that
homely
bench
called
and
be
thankful
on
the
crest
of
loughrigg
fell
he
was
beginning
to
learn
the
names
of
the
hills
already
yonder
darkling
brow
rugged
gloomy
looking
was
nab
scar
yonder
green
slope
of
sunny
pasture
stretching
wide
its
two
arms
as
if
to
enfold
the
valley
was
fairfield
and
here
close
on
the
left
as
he
faced
the
lake
were
silver
howe
and
helm
crag
with
that
stony
excrescence
on
the
summit
of
the
latter
known
as
the
and
the
lamb
lady
maulevrier
house
stood
within
a
circle
of
mountain
peaks
and
long
fells
which
walled
in
the
deep
placid
fertile
valley
you
are
not
too
tired
to
see
the
gardens
we
might
show
them
to
you
before
breakfast
said
maulevrier
have
of
an
hour
to
the
good
an
hour
for
a
stroll
and
a
quarter
to
make
myself
presentable
after
my
long
walk
said
hammond
who
did
not
wish
to
face
the
dowager
and
lady
lesbia
in
disordered
apparel
lady
mary
was
such
an
obvious
tomboy
that
he
might
be
pardoned
for
leaving
her
out
of
the
question
they
set
out
upon
an
exploration
of
the
gardens
mary
clinging
to
her
brother
arm
as
if
she
wanted
to
make
sure
of
him
and
still
carrying
angelina
the
gardens
were
as
other
gardens
but
passing
beautiful
the
sloping
lawns
and
banks
winding
shrubberies
broad
terraces
cut
on
the
side
of
the
hill
gave
infinite
variety
all
that
wealth
and
taste
and
labour
could
do
to
make
those
grounds
beautiful
had
been
done
the
rarest
conifers
the
loveliest
flowering
shrubs
grew
and
flourished
there
and
the
flowers
bloomed
as
they
bloom
only
in
lakeland
where
every
cottage
garden
can
show
a
wealth
of
luxurious
bloom
unknown
in
more
exposed
and
arid
districts
mary
was
very
proud
of
those
gardens
she
had
loved
them
and
worked
in
them
from
her
babyhood
trotting
about
on
chubby
legs
after
some
chosen
old
gardener
carrying
a
few
weeds
or
withered
leaves
in
her
pinafore
and
fancying
herself
useful
help
does
i
teeven
she
used
to
say
to
the
old
gardener
who
first
taught
her
to
distinguish
flowers
from
weeds
shall
never
learn
as
much
out
of
these
horrid
books
as
poor
old
stevens
taught
me
she
said
afterwards
when
the
gray
head
was
at
rest
under
the
sod
and
governesses
botany
manuals
and
hard
words
from
the
greek
were
the
order
of
the
day
nine
was
the
breakfast
hour
at
fellside
there
were
no
family
prayers
lady
maulevrier
did
not
pretend
to
be
pious
and
she
put
no
restraints
of
piety
upon
other
people
she
went
to
church
on
sunday
mornings
for
the
sake
of
example
but
she
read
all
the
newest
scientific
books
subscribed
to
the
anthropological
society
and
thought
as
the
newest
scientific
people
think
she
rarely
communicated
her
opinions
among
her
own
sex
but
now
and
then
in
strictly
masculine
and
superior
society
she
had
been
heard
to
express
herself
freely
upon
the
nebular
hypothesis
and
the
doctrine
of
evolution
all
what
does
it
matter
she
said
finally
with
her
grand
air
have
only
to
marry
my
granddaughters
creditably
and
prevent
my
grandson
going
to
the
dogs
and
then
my
mission
on
this
insignificant
planet
will
be
accomplished
what
new
form
that
particular
modification
of
molecules
which
you
call
lady
maulevrier
may
take
afterwards
is
hidden
in
the
great
mystery
of
material
life
there
was
no
family
prayer
therefore
at
fellside
the
sisters
had
been
properly
educated
in
their
religious
duties
had
been
taught
the
anglican
faith
carefully
and
well
by
their
governess
fräulein
müller
who
had
become
a
staunch
anglican
before
entering
the
families
of
the
english
nobility
and
by
the
kind
vicar
of
grasmere
who
took
a
warm
interest
in
the
orphan
girls
their
grandmother
had
given
them
to
understand
that
they
might
be
as
religious
as
they
liked
she
would
be
no
let
or
hindrance
to
their
piety
but
they
must
ask
her
no
awkward
questions
have
read
a
great
deal
and
thought
a
great
deal
and
my
ideas
are
still
in
a
state
of
transition
she
told
lesbia
and
lesbia
who
was
somewhat
automatic
in
her
piety
had
no
desire
to
know
more
lady
maulevrier
seldom
appeared
in
the
forenoon
she
was
an
early
riser
being
too
vivid
and
highly
strung
a
creature
even
at
years
of
age
to
give
way
to
sloth
she
rose
at
seven
summer
and
winter
but
she
spent
the
early
part
of
the
day
in
her
own
rooms
reading
writing
giving
orders
to
her
housekeeper
and
occasionally
interviewing
steadman
who
without
any
onerous
duties
was
certainly
the
most
influential
person
in
the
house
people
in
the
village
talked
of
him
and
envied
him
so
good
a
berth
he
had
a
gentleman
house
to
live
in
and
to
all
appearance
lived
as
a
gentleman
this
tranquil
retirement
free
from
care
or
labour
was
a
rich
reward
for
the
faithful
service
of
his
youth
and
it
was
known
by
the
better
informed
among
the
grasmere
people
that
steadman
was
saving
money
and
had
shares
in
the
railway
these
facts
had
oozed
out
of
themselves
as
it
were
he
was
not
a
communicative
man
and
rarely
wasted
half
an
hour
at
the
snug
little
inn
near
oswald
church
amidst
the
cluster
of
habitations
that
was
once
called
kirktown
he
was
an
unsociable
man
people
said
and
thought
himself
better
than
grasmere
folk
the
keepers
and
guides
and
wrestlers
and
the
honest
friendly
souls
who
were
the
outcome
of
that
band
of
norwegian
exiles
which
found
a
home
in
these
peaceful
vales
miss
müller
more
commonly
known
as
fräulein
officiated
at
breakfast
she
never
appeared
at
the
board
when
lady
maulevrier
was
present
but
in
her
ladyship
absence
miss
müller
was
guardian
of
the
proprieties
she
was
a
stout
kindly
creature
and
by
no
means
a
formidable
dragon
when
the
gong
sounded
john
hammond
went
into
the
where
he
found
miss
müller
seated
alone
in
front
of
the
urn
he
bowed
quick
to
read
or
in
the
appearance
and
she
bowed
hope
you
have
had
a
nice
walk
she
said
saw
you
from
my
bedroom
window
you
then
i
suppose
yours
is
one
of
the
few
windows
which
look
into
that
curious
old
quadrangle
there
are
no
windows
looking
into
the
quadrangle
those
that
were
in
the
original
plan
of
the
house
were
walled
up
at
her
orders
to
keep
out
the
cold
winds
which
sweep
down
from
the
hills
in
winter
and
early
spring
when
the
edge
of
loughrigg
fell
is
white
with
snow
my
window
looks
into
the
gardens
and
i
saw
you
there
with
his
lordship
and
lady
mary
lady
lesbia
came
in
at
this
moment
and
saluted
hammond
with
a
haughty
inclination
of
her
beautiful
head
she
looked
lovelier
in
her
simple
morning
gown
of
pale
blue
cambric
than
in
her
more
elaborate
toilette
of
last
evening
such
purity
of
complexion
such
lustrous
eyes
the
untarnished
beauty
of
youth
breathing
the
delicate
freshness
of
a
flower
she
might
be
as
scornful
as
she
pleased
yet
john
hammond
could
not
withhold
his
admiration
he
was
inclined
to
admire
a
woman
who
kept
him
at
a
distance
for
the
general
bent
of
young
women
is
otherwise
maulevrier
and
mary
came
in
and
everyone
sat
down
to
breakfast
lady
lesbia
unbent
a
little
presently
and
smiled
upon
the
stranger
there
was
a
relief
in
a
stranger
presence
he
talked
of
new
things
places
and
people
she
had
never
seen
she
brightened
and
became
quite
friendly
deigned
to
invite
the
expression
of
hammond
opinions
upon
music
and
art
and
after
breakfast
allowed
him
to
follow
her
into
the
and
to
linger
there
fascinated
for
half
an
hour
looking
over
her
newest
books
and
her
last
batch
of
music
but
looking
most
of
all
at
her
while
maulevrier
and
mary
were
loafing
on
the
lawn
outside
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
this
morning
asked
maulevrier
appearing
suddenly
at
the
window
you
like
answered
hammond
there
is
one
pilgrimage
i
am
eager
to
make
i
must
see
wordsworth
grave
and
house
shall
see
them
both
but
they
are
in
opposite
directions
one
at
your
elbow
the
other
a
four
mile
walk
which
will
you
see
first
toss
for
it
taking
a
shilling
from
a
pocketful
of
loose
cash
always
ready
for
moments
of
hesitation
house
tails
grave
tails
it
is
come
and
have
a
smoke
and
see
the
poet
grave
the
splendour
of
the
monument
the
exquisite
neatness
with
which
it
is
kept
will
astound
you
considering
that
we
live
in
a
period
of
wordsworth
worship
hammond
hesitated
and
looked
at
lady
lesbia
you
coming
called
maulevrier
from
the
lawn
was
a
fair
offer
i
got
my
cigarette
case
i
coming
answered
the
other
with
a
disappointed
air
he
had
hoped
that
lesbia
would
offer
to
show
him
the
poet
grave
he
could
not
abandon
that
hope
without
a
struggle
you
come
with
us
lady
lesbia
we
suppress
the
cigarettes
no
she
said
becoming
suddenly
frigid
am
going
to
practice
you
never
walk
in
the
morning
on
such
a
lovely
morning
as
this
very
often
she
had
those
frozen
regions
from
which
his
attentions
had
lured
him
for
a
little
while
she
had
reminded
herself
of
the
inferior
social
position
of
this
person
in
whose
conversation
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
interested
cried
maulevrier
from
below
and
they
went
mary
would
have
very
much
liked
to
go
with
them
but
she
did
not
want
to
be
intrusive
so
she
went
off
to
the
kennels
to
see
the
terriers
eat
their
morning
and
only
meal
of
dog
biscuit
chapter
viii
there
is
always
a
skeleton
the
two
young
men
strolled
through
the
village
maulevrier
pausing
to
exchange
greetings
with
almost
everyone
he
met
and
so
to
the
rustic
churchyard
above
the
beck
the
beck
was
swollen
with
late
rains
and
was
brawling
merrily
over
its
stony
bed
the
churchyard
grass
was
deep
and
cool
and
shadowy
under
the
clustering
branches
the
poet
tomb
was
disappointing
in
its
unlovely
simplicity
its
stern
slatey
hue
the
plainest
granite
cross
would
have
satisfied
hammond
or
a
cross
in
pure
white
marble
with
a
sculptured
lamb
at
the
base
surely
the
lamb
emblem
at
once
pastoral
and
sacred
ought
to
enter
into
any
monument
to
wordsworth
but
that
gray
headstone
with
its
catalogue
of
dates
those
stern
iron
railings
were
these
fit
memorials
of
one
whose
soul
so
loved
loveliness
after
hammond
had
seen
the
little
old
old
church
and
the
medallion
portrait
inside
had
seen
all
that
maulevrier
could
show
him
in
fact
the
two
young
men
went
back
to
the
place
of
graves
and
sat
on
the
low
parapet
above
the
beck
smoking
their
cigarettes
and
talking
with
that
perfect
unreserve
which
can
only
obtain
between
men
who
are
old
and
tried
friends
they
talked
as
it
was
only
natural
they
should
talk
of
that
household
at
fellside
where
all
things
were
new
to
john
hammond
like
my
sister
lesbia
said
maulevrier
her
well
yes
the
difficulty
with
most
men
must
be
not
to
worship
her
she
not
my
style
and
she
beastly
proud
little
gives
piquancy
to
her
beauty
i
admire
a
grand
woman
do
i
in
a
picture
titian
queen
of
cyprus
or
any
party
of
that
kind
but
for
flesh
and
blood
i
like
humility
a
woman
who
knows
she
is
human
and
not
infallible
and
only
just
a
little
better
than
you
or
me
when
i
choose
a
wife
she
will
be
no
such
example
of
cultivated
perfection
as
my
sister
lesbia
i
want
no
goddess
but
a
nice
little
womanly
woman
to
jog
along
the
rough
and
tumble
road
of
life
with
me
maulevrier
influence
no
doubt
has
in
a
great
measure
determined
the
bent
of
your
sister
character
and
from
what
you
have
told
me
about
her
ladyship
i
should
think
a
fixed
idea
of
her
own
superiority
would
be
inevitable
in
any
girl
trained
by
her
she
is
a
proud
woman
a
proud
hard
woman
and
she
has
steeped
lesbia
mind
in
all
her
own
pet
ideas
and
prejudices
yet
god
knows
we
have
little
reason
to
hold
our
heads
high
said
maulevrier
with
a
gloomy
look
john
hammond
did
not
reply
to
this
remark
perhaps
there
was
some
difficulty
for
a
man
situated
as
he
was
in
finding
a
fit
reply
he
smoked
in
silence
looking
down
at
the
pure
swift
waters
of
the
rotha
tumbling
over
the
crags
and
boulders
below
somebody
say
there
is
always
a
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
and
the
nobler
and
more
ancient
the
race
the
bigger
the
skeleton
said
maulevrier
with
a
philosophical
air
your
family
secret
is
an
attribute
of
a
fine
old
race
the
pelopidæ
for
instance
in
their
case
it
was
not
a
single
skeleton
but
a
whole
charnel
house
i
do
think
your
skeleton
need
trouble
you
maulevrier
it
belongs
to
the
remote
past
things
never
belong
to
the
past
said
the
young
man
it
were
any
other
kind
of
taint
profligacy
madness
even
the
story
of
a
duel
that
went
very
near
murder
a
runaway
wife
a
rebellious
son
a
cruel
husband
i
have
heard
such
stories
hinted
at
in
the
records
of
families
but
our
story
means
disgrace
i
seldom
see
strangers
putting
their
heads
together
at
the
club
without
fancying
they
are
telling
each
other
about
my
grandfather
and
pointing
me
out
as
the
grandson
and
heir
of
a
thief
use
unduly
hard
words
should
i
stoop
to
sophistication
with
you
my
friend
dishonesty
is
dishonesty
all
the
world
over
and
to
plunder
rajahs
on
a
large
scale
is
no
less
vile
than
to
pick
a
pocket
on
ludgate
hill
was
ever
proved
against
your
grandfather
he
died
in
the
nick
of
time
and
the
inquiry
was
squashed
thanks
to
the
angersthorpe
interest
and
my
grandmother
cleverness
but
if
he
had
lived
a
few
weeks
longer
england
would
have
rung
with
the
story
of
his
profligacy
and
dishonour
some
people
say
he
committed
suicide
in
order
to
escape
the
inquiry
but
i
have
heard
my
mother
emphatically
deny
this
my
father
told
her
that
he
had
often
talked
with
the
people
who
kept
the
little
inn
where
his
father
died
and
they
were
clear
enough
in
their
assertion
that
the
death
was
a
natural
death
the
sudden
collapse
of
an
exhausted
constitution
it
on
account
of
this
scandal
that
your
father
spent
the
best
part
of
his
life
away
from
england
hammond
asked
feeling
that
it
was
a
relief
to
maulevrier
to
talk
about
this
secret
burden
of
his
the
young
earl
was
and
frivolous
by
nature
yet
even
he
had
his
graver
moments
and
upon
this
subject
of
the
old
maulevrier
scandal
he
was
peculiarly
sensitive
perhaps
all
the
more
so
because
his
grandmother
had
never
allowed
him
to
speak
to
her
about
it
had
never
satisfied
his
curiosity
upon
any
details
of
that
painful
story
have
very
little
doubt
it
was
so
though
i
was
old
enough
when
he
died
to
hear
as
much
from
his
own
lips
my
father
went
straight
from
the
university
to
vienna
where
he
began
his
career
in
the
diplomatic
service
and
where
he
soon
afterwards
married
a
dowerless
english
girl
of
good
family
he
went
to
rio
as
first
secretary
and
died
of
fever
within
seven
years
of
his
marriage
leaving
a
widow
and
three
babies
the
youngest
in
long
clothes
mother
and
babies
all
came
over
to
england
and
were
at
once
established
at
fellside
i
can
remember
the
voyage
and
i
can
remember
my
poor
mother
who
never
recovered
the
blow
of
my
father
death
and
who
died
in
yonder
house
after
five
years
of
broken
health
and
broken
spirits
we
had
no
one
but
the
dowager
to
look
to
as
children
hardly
another
friend
in
the
world
she
did
what
she
liked
with
us
she
kept
the
girls
as
close
as
nuns
so
have
never
heard
a
hint
of
the
old
history
no
breach
of
scandal
has
reached
ears
but
she
could
not
shut
me
up
in
a
country
house
for
ever
though
she
did
succeed
in
keeping
me
away
from
a
public
school
the
time
came
when
i
had
to
go
to
the
university
and
there
i
heard
all
that
had
been
said
about
lord
maulevrier
the
men
who
told
me
about
the
old
scandal
in
a
friendly
way
pretended
not
to
believe
it
but
one
night
when
i
had
got
into
a
row
at
a
with
a
tailor
son
he
told
me
that
if
his
father
was
a
snip
my
grandfather
was
a
thief
and
so
he
thought
himself
the
better
bred
of
the
two
i
smashed
his
nose
for
him
but
as
it
was
a
decided
pug
before
the
row
began
that
hardly
squared
the
matter
you
ever
hear
the
exact
story
have
heard
a
dozen
stories
and
if
only
a
quarter
of
them
are
true
my
grandfather
was
a
scoundrel
it
seems
that
he
was
immensely
popular
for
the
first
year
or
so
of
his
government
gave
more
splendid
entertainments
than
had
been
given
at
madras
for
half
a
century
before
his
time
lavished
his
wealth
upon
his
favourites
then
arose
a
rumour
that
the
governor
was
insolvent
and
harassed
by
his
creditors
and
then
a
new
source
of
wealth
seemed
to
be
at
his
command
he
was
more
reckless
more
princely
than
ever
and
then
little
by
little
there
arose
the
suspicion
that
he
was
trafficking
in
english
interests
selling
his
influence
to
petty
princes
winking
at
those
mysterious
crimes
by
which
rightful
heirs
are
pushed
aside
to
make
room
for
usurpers
lastly
it
became
notorious
that
he
was
the
slave
of
a
wicked
woman
false
wife
suspected
murderess
whose
husband
a
native
prince
disappeared
from
the
scene
just
when
his
existence
became
perilous
to
the
governor
reputation
according
to
one
version
of
the
story
the
scandal
of
this
rajah
mysterious
disappearance
followed
not
long
after
by
the
ranee
equally
mysterious
death
was
the
immediate
cause
of
my
grandfather
recall
how
much
or
how
little
of
this
story
or
other
dark
stories
of
the
same
kind
is
true
whether
my
grandfather
was
a
consummate
scoundrel
or
the
victim
of
a
baseless
slander
whether
he
left
india
a
rich
man
or
a
poor
man
is
known
to
no
mortal
except
lady
maulevrier
and
compared
with
her
the
theban
sphinx
was
a
communicative
individual
the
dead
bury
their
dead
said
hammond
you
nor
your
sisters
can
be
the
worse
for
this
ancient
slander
no
doubt
every
part
of
the
story
has
been
distorted
and
exaggerated
in
the
telling
and
a
great
deal
of
it
may
be
pure
invention
evolved
from
the
inner
consciousness
of
the
slanderer
god
forbid
that
any
whisper
of
scandal
should
ever
reach
lady
lesbia
ears
he
ignored
poor
mary
it
was
to
him
as
if
there
were
no
such
person
her
feeble
light
was
extinguished
by
the
radiance
of
her
sister
beauty
her
very
individuality
was
annihilated
for
you
dear
old
fellow
he
said
with
warm
affection
one
will
ever
think
the
worse
of
you
on
account
of
your
peccadilloes
they
will
hereditary
genius
is
one
of
our
modern
crazes
when
a
man
grandfather
was
a
rogue
there
must
be
a
taint
in
his
blood
people
do
believe
in
spontaneous
generation
moral
or
physical
typhoid
breeds
typhoid
and
typhus
breeds
typhus
just
as
dog
breeds
dog
and
who
will
believe
that
a
cheat
and
a
liar
can
be
the
father
of
honest
men
that
case
knowing
what
kind
of
man
the
grandson
is
i
will
never
believe
that
the
grandfather
was
a
rogue
said
hammond
heartily
maulevrier
put
out
his
hand
without
a
word
and
it
was
warmly
grasped
by
his
friend
for
her
ladyship
i
respect
and
honour
her
as
a
woman
who
has
led
a
life
of
and
has
worn
her
pride
as
an
armour
continued
hammond
i
believe
the
dowager
character
is
rather
fine
said
maulevrier
she
and
i
have
never
hit
our
horses
very
well
together
she
would
have
liked
such
a
fellow
as
you
for
a
grandson
jack
a
man
who
took
high
honours
at
oxford
and
could
hold
his
own
against
all
comers
such
a
grandson
would
have
gratified
her
pride
and
would
have
repaid
her
for
the
trouble
she
had
taken
in
nursing
the
maulevrier
estate
for
however
poor
a
property
it
was
when
her
husband
went
to
india
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
very
fine
estate
now
and
that
the
dowager
has
been
the
making
of
it
the
two
young
men
strolled
up
to
easedale
tarn
before
they
went
back
to
fellside
where
lady
maulevrier
received
them
with
a
stately
graciousness
and
where
lady
lesbia
unbent
considerably
at
luncheon
and
condescended
to
an
animated
conversation
with
her
brother
friend
it
was
such
a
new
thing
to
have
a
stranger
at
the
family
board
a
man
whose
information
was
well
abreast
with
the
march
of
progress
who
could
talk
eloquently
upon
every
subject
which
people
care
to
talk
about
in
this
new
and
animated
society
lesbia
seemed
like
an
enchanted
princess
suddenly
awakened
from
a
slumber
molly
looked
at
her
sister
with
absolute
astonishment
never
had
she
seen
her
so
bright
so
beautiful
no
longer
a
picture
or
a
statue
but
a
woman
warm
with
the
glow
of
life
wonder
hammond
admires
her
thought
poor
molly
who
was
quite
acute
enough
to
see
the
stranger
keen
appreciation
of
her
charms
and
positive
indifference
towards
herself
there
are
some
things
which
women
find
out
by
instinct
just
as
the
needle
turns
towards
the
magnet
shut
a

up
in
a
tower

she
is
eighteen
years
old
and
on
the
day
of
her
release
introduce
her
to
the
first
man
her
eyes
have
ever
looked
upon
and
she
will
know
at
a
glance
whether
he
admires

the
four
young
people

for

walkers

though
she
looked

to
active
habits

a
colley
and
an
was
at
no
loss
for
society
on
the
road
more
especially
as
maulevrier
gave
her
most
of
his
company
and
entertained
her
with
an
account
of
his
black
forest
adventures
and
all
the
fine
things
he
had
said
to
the
baden
girls
who
had
sold
him
photographs
or
wild
strawberries
or
had
awakened
the
echoes
of
the
hills
with
the
music
of
their
rustic
flutes
fräulein
was
perfectly
aware
that
her
mission
upon
this
particular
afternoon
was
not
to
let
lady
lesbia
out
of
her
sight
for
an
instant
to
hear
every
word
the
young
lady
said
and
every
word
hammond
addressed
to
her
she
had
received
no
specific
instructions
from
lady
maulevrier
they
were
not
necessary
for
the
fräulein
knew
her
ladyship
intentions
with
regard
to
her
elder
granddaughter
knew
them
at
least
so
far
as
that
lesbia
was
intended
to
make
a
brilliant
marriage
and
she
knew
therefore
that
the
presence
of
this
handsome
and
altogether
attractive
young
man
was
to
the
last
degree
obnoxious
to
the
dowager
she
was
obliged
to
be
civil
to
him
for
her
nephew
sake
and
she
was
too
wise
to
let
lesbia
imagine
him
dangerous
but
the
fact
that
he
was
dangerous
was
obvious
and
it
was
fräulein
duty
to
protect
her
employer
interests
everybody
knew
lord
maulevrier
so
there
was
no
difficulty
about
getting
admission
to
wordsworth
garden
and
wordsworth
house
and
after
hammond
and
his
companions
had
explored
these
they
went
back
to
the
shores
of
the
little
lake
and
climbed
that
rocky
eminence
upon
which
the
poet
used
to
sit
above
the
placid
waters
of
silvery
rydal
it
is
a
lovely
spot
and
that
narrow
lake
so
poor
a
thing
were
magnitude
the
gauge
of
beauty
had
a
soft
and
pensive
loveliness
in
the
clear
afternoon
light
wordsworth
sighed
lesbia
as
she
stood
on
the
grassy
crag
looking
down
on
the
shining
water
broken
in
the
foreground
by
fringes
of
rushes
and
the
rich
luxuriance
of
it
not
pitiable
to
think
of
the
years
he
spent
in
this
monotonous
place
without
any
society
worth
speaking
of
with
only
the
shabbiest
collection
of
books
with
hardly
any
interest
in
life
except
the
sky
and
the
hills
and
the
peasantry
think
wordsworth
was
an
essentially
happy
life
in
spite
of
his
narrow
range
answered
hammond
with
your
ardent
youth
and
vivid
desire
for
a
life
of
action
can
not
imagine
the
calm
blisses
of
reverie
and
constant
communion
with
nature
wordsworth
had
a
thousand
companions
you
and
i
would
never
dream
of
for
him
every
flower
that
grows
was
an
individual
existence
almost
a
soul
was
a
mild
kind
of
lunacy
an
everlasting
opium
dream
without
the
opium
but
i
am
grateful
to
him
for
living
such
a
life
since
it
has
bequeathed
us
some
exquisite
poetry
said
lesbia
who
had
been
too
carefully
cultured
to
fleer
or
flout
at
wordsworth
do
believe
there
an
otter
just
under
that
bank
cried
molly
who
had
been
watching
the
obvious
excitement
of
her
hound
and
she
rushed
down
to
the
brink
of
the
water
leaping
lightly
from
stone
to
stone
and
inciting
the
hound
to
business
him
alone
ca
you
roared
maulevrier
him
in
peace
till
he
wanted
if
you
disturb
him
now
he
desert
his
holt
and
we
may
have
a
blank
day
the
hounds
are
to
be
out
may
go
with
you
asked
mary
eagerly
yes
i
suppose
you
want
to
be
in
it
molly
and
her
brother
went
on
an
exploring
ramble
along
the
edge
of
the
water
towards
ambleside
leaving
john
hammond
in
lesbia
company
but
closely
guarded
by
miss
müller
these
three
went
to
look
at
nab
cottage
where
poor
hartley
coleridge
ended
his
brief
and
clouded
days
and
they
had
gone
some
way
upon
their
homeward
walk
before
they
were
rejoined
by
maulevrier
and
mary
the
damsel
kilted
skirt
considerably
the
worse
for
mud
and
mire
would
grandmother
say
if
she
were
to
see
you
exclaimed
lesbia
looking
contemptuously
at
the
muddy
petticoat
am
not
going
to
let
her
see
me
so
she
will
say
nothing
cried
mary
and
then
she
called
to
the
dogs
agag
angelina
and
the
three
fox
terriers
flew
along
the
road
falling
over
themselves
in
the
swiftness
of
their
flight
darting
and
leaping
and
scrambling
over
each
other
and
offering
the
spectators
the
most
intense
example
of
joyous
animal
life
the
colley
was
far
up
on
the
and
the
was
still
hunting
the
water
but
the
terriers
never
went
out
of
mary
sight
they
looked
to
her
to
take
the
initiative
in
all
their
sports
they
were
back
at
fellside
in
time
for
a
very
late
tea
lady
maulevrier
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
grandmother
why
did
you
not
take
your
tea
exclaimed
lesbia
looking
really
distressed
is
six
am
used
to
have
you
at
home
to
hand
me
my
cup
replied
the
dowager
with
a
touch
of
reproachfulness
am
so
sorry
said
lesbia
sitting
down
before
the
and
beginning
her
accustomed
duty
dear
grandmother
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
but
it
was
such
a
lovely
afternoon
and
hammond
is
so
interested
in
everything
connected
with
wordsworth
she
was
looking
her
loveliest
at
this
moment
all
that
was
softest
in
her
nature
called
forth
by
her
desire
to
please
her
grandmother
whom
she
really
loved
she
hung
over
lady
maulevrier
chair
attending
to
her
small
wants
and
seeming
scarcely
to
remember
the
existence
of
anyone
else
in
this
phase
of
her
character
she
seemed
to
hammond
the
perfection
of
womanly
grace
mary
had
rushed
off
to
her
room
to
change
her
muddy
gown
and
came
in
presently
dressed
for
dinner
looking
the
picture
of
innocence
john
hammond
received
his
from
lesbia
hand
and
lingered
in
the
talking
to
the
dowager
and
her
granddaughters
till
it
was
time
to
dress
lady
maulevrier
found
herself
favourably
impressed
by
him
in
spite
of
her
prejudices
it
was
very
provoking
of
maulevrier
to
have
brought
such
a
man
to
fellside
his
very
merits
were
objectionable
she
tried
with
exquisite
art
to
draw
him
into
some
revealment
as
to
his
family
and
antecedents
but
he
evaded
every
attempt
of
that
kind
it
was
too
evident
that
he
was
a
man
whose
intellect
and
good
looks
were
his
only
fortune
it
was
criminal
in
maulevrier
to
have
brought
such
a
person
to
fellside
her
ladyship
began
to
think
seriously
of
sending
the
two
girls
to
st
bees
or
tynemouth
for
change
of
air
in
charge
of
fräulein
but
any
sudden
proceeding
of
that
kind
would
inevitably
awaken
lesbia
suspicions
and
there
is
nothing
so
fatal
to
a
woman
peace
as
this
idea
of
danger
no
the
peril
must
be
faced
she
could
only
hope
that
maulevrier
would
soon
tire
of
fellside
a
westmoreland
weather
gray
skies
and
long
rainy
days
would
send
these
young
men
away
chapter
ix
a
cry
in
the
darkness
the
peril
had
to
be
faced
for
the
weather
did
not
favour
lady
maulevrier
hopes
westmoreland
skies
forgot
to
shed
their
accustomed
showers
westmoreland
hills
seemed
to
have
lost
their
power
of
drawing
down
the
rain
that
august
was
a
lovely
month
and
the
young
people
at
fellside
revelled
in
ideal
weather
maulevrier
took
his
friend
everywhere
by
hill
and
stream
and
force
and
gill
to
all
those
chosen
spots
which
make
the
glory
of
the
lake
country
on
windermere
and
thirlmere
away
through
the
bleak
pass
of
kirkstone
to
ullswater
on
driving
excursions
and
on
boating
excursions
and
pedestrian
rambles
which
latter
the
hammond
seemed
to
like
best
of
all
for
he
was
a
splendid
walker
and
loved
the
freedom
of
a
mountain
ramble
the
liberty
to
pause
and
loiter
and
waste
an
hour
at
will
without
being
accountable
to
anybody
coachman
or
responsible
for
the
of
anybody
horses
on
some
occasions
the
two
girls
and
miss
müller
were
of
the
party
and
then
it
seemed
to
john
hammond
as
if
nothing
were
needed
to
complete
the
glory
of
earth
and
sky
there
were
other
days
rougher
journeys
when
the
men
went
alone
and
there
were
days
when
lady
mary
stole
away
from
her
books
and
music
and
all
those
studies
which
she
was
supposed
still
to
be
pursuing
no
longer
closely
supervised
by
her
governess
but
on
parole
as
it
were
and
went
with
her
brother
and
his
friend
across
the
hills
and
far
away
those
were
happy
days
for
mary
for
it
was
always
delight
to
her
to
be
with
maulevrier
yet
she
had
a
profound
conviction
of
john
hammond
indifference
kind
and
courteous
as
he
was
in
all
his
dealings
with
her
and
a
sense
of
her
own
inferiority
of
her
own
humble
charms
and
little
power
to
please
which
was
so
acute
as
to
be
almost
pain
one
day
this
keen
sense
of
humiliation
broke
from
her
unawares
in
her
talk
with
her
brother
as
they
two
sat
on
a
broad
heathy
slope
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
langdale
pikes
and
with
a
deep
valley
at
their
feet
while
john
hammond
was
climbing
from
rock
to
rock
in
the
gorge
on
their
right
exploring
the
beauties
of
dungeon
ghyll
wonder
whether
he
thinks
me
very
ugly
said
mary
with
her
hands
clasped
upon
her
knees
her
eyes
fixed
on
wetherlam
upon
whose
steep
brow
a
craggy
mass
of
brown
rock
clothed
with
crimson
heather
stood
out
from
the
velvety
green
of
the
thinks
you
ugly
hammond
i
sure
he
does
i
am
so
sunburnt
and
so
horrid
you
are
not
ugly
why
molly
what
are
you
dreaming
about
yes
i
am
ugly
i
may
not
seem
so
to
you
perhaps
because
you
are
used
to
me
but
i
know
he
must
think
me
very
plain
compared
with
lesbia
whom
he
admires
so
much
he
admires
lesbia
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
i
know
he
thinks
me
plain
said
molly
contemplating
wetherlam
with
sorrowful
eyes
as
if
the
sequence
were
inevitable
dearest
girl
what
nonsense
plain
forsooth
ugly
quotha
why
there
are
not
a
finer
pair
of
eyes
in
westmoreland
than
my
molly
or
a
prettier
smile
or
whiter
teeth
all
the
rest
is
horrid
said
mary
intensely
in
earnest
am
sunburnt
freckled
and
altogether
odious
like
a
haymaker
or
a
market
woman
grandmother
has
said
so
often
enough
and
i
know
it
is
the
truth
i
can
see
it
in
hammond
manner
freckles
and
sunburn
and
the
haymaker
and
all
that
cried
maulevrier
laughing
an
expressive
manner
jack
must
be
if
it
can
convey
all
that
like
lord
burleigh
nod
by
jove
why
what
a
goose
you
are
mary
jack
thinks
you
a
very
nice
girl
and
a
very
pretty
girl
i
be
bound
but
are
you
clever
enough
to
understand
that
when
a
man
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
one
woman
he
is
apt
to
seem
just
a
little
indifferent
to
all
the
other
women
in
the
world
and
there
is
no
doubt
jack
is
desperately
in
love
with
lesbia
ought
not
to
let
him
be
in
love
with
her
protested
mary
know
it
can
only
lead
to
his
unhappiness
you
must
know
what
grandmother
is
and
how
she
has
made
up
her
mind
that
lesbia
is
to
marry
some
great
person
you
ought
not
to
have
brought
hammond
here
it
is
like
letting
him
into
a
trap
you
think
it
was
wrong
asked
her
brother
smiling
at
her
earnestness
should
be
very
sorry
if
poor
jack
should
come
to
grief
but
still
if
lesbia
likes
him
which
i
think
she
does
we
ought
to
be
able
to
talk
over
the
dowager
cried
mary
would
never
give
way
you
have
no
idea
how
ambitious
she
is
why
once
when
lesbia
was
in
a
poetical
mood
and
said
she
would
marry
the
man
she
liked
best
in
the
world
if
he
were
a
pauper
her
ladyship
flew
into
a
terrible
passion
and
told
her
she
would
renounce
her
that
she
would
curse
her
if
she
were
to
marry
beneath
her
or
marry
without
her
grandmother
consent
lines
for
hammond
said
maulevrier
rather
lightly
i
suppose
we
must
give
up
the
idea
of
a
match
between
him
and
lesbia
ought
not
to
have
brought
him
here
retorted
mary
had
better
invent
some
plan
for
sending
him
away
if
he
stay
it
will
be
only
to
break
his
heart
child
men
hearts
do
not
break
so
easily
i
have
fancied
that
mine
was
broken
more
than
once
in
my
life
yet
it
is
sound
enough
i
assure
you
sighed
mary
you
are
not
like
him
wounds
do
not
go
so
deep
with
you
the
subject
of
their
conversation
came
out
of
the
rocky
cleft
in
the
hills
as
mary
spoke
she
saw
his
hat
appearing
out
of
the
gorge
and
then
the
man
himself
emerged
a
tall
figure
clad
in
brown
tweed
coming
towards
them
with
and
in
his
pocket
he
had
been
making
what
he
called
memoranda
of
the
waterfall
a
stone
or
two
here
a
cluster
of
ferns
there
or
a
tree
torn
up
by
the
roots
and
yet
green
and
living
hanging
across
the
torrent
a
rude
natural
bridge
this
round
by
the
langdale
pikes
and
dungeon
ghyll
was
one
of
their
best
days
or
at
least
molly
and
her
brother
thought
so
for
to
those
two
the
presence
of
lesbia
and
her
chaperon
was
always
a
restraint
mary
could
walk
twice
as
far
as
her
elder
sister
and
revelled
in
paths
and
all
manner
of
rough
places
they
ordered
their
luncheon
at
the
inn
below
the
waterfall
and
had
it
carried
up
on
to
the
furzy
slope
in
front
of
wetherlam
where
they
could
eat
and
drink
and
be
merry
to
the
music
of
the
force
as
it
came
down
from
the
hills
behind
them
while
the
lights
and
shadows
came
and
went
upon
yonder
rugged
brow
now
gray
in
the
shadow
now
ruddy
in
the
sunshine
mary
was
as
gay
as
a
bird
during
that
rough
and
ready
luncheon
no
one
would
have
suspected
her
uneasiness
about
john
hammond
peril
or
her
own
plainness
she
might
let
her
real
self
appear
to
her
brother
who
had
been
her
trusted
friend
and
father
confessor
from
her
babyhood
but
she
was
too
thorough
a
woman
to
let
hammond
discover
the
depth
of
her
sympathy
the
tenderness
of
her
compassion
for
his
woes
later
as
they
were
walking
home
across
the
hills
by
great
langdale
and
little
langdale
and
fox
howe
and
loughrigg
fell
she
fell
behind
a
few
paces
with
maulevrier
and
said
to
him
very
earnestly
wo
tell
will
you
dear
what
he
asked
staring
at
her
tell
hammond
what
i
said
about
his
thinking
me
ugly
he
might
want
to
apologise
to
me
and
that
would
be
too
humiliating
i
was
very
childish
to
say
such
a
silly
thing
you
were
you
wo
tell
him
him
anything
that
would
degrade
my
mary
assail
her
dignity
by
so
much
as
a
breath
sooner
would
i
have
this
tongue
torn
out
with
pincers
on
the
next
day
and
the
next
sunshine
and
summer
skies
still
prevailed
but
hammond
did
not
seem
to
care
for
rambling
far
afield
he
preferred
loitering
about
in
the
village
rowing
on
the
lake
reading
in
the
garden
and
playing
lawn
tennis
he
had
only
inclination
for
those
amusements
which
kept
him
within
a
stone
throw
of
fellside
and
mary
knew
that
this
disposition
had
arisen
in
his
mind
since
lesbia
had
withdrawn
herself
from
all
share
in
their
excursions
lesbia
had
not
been
rude
to
her
brother
or
her
brother
friend
she
had
declined
their
invitations
with
smiles
and
sweetness
but
there
was
always
some
reason
a
new
song
to
be
practised
a
new
book
to
be
read
a
letter
to
be
written
why
she
should
not
go
for
drives
or
walks
or
steamboat
trips
with
maulevrier
and
his
friend
so
hammond
suddenly
found
out
that
he
had
seen
all
that
was
worth
seeing
in
the
lake
country
and
that
there
was
nothing
so
enjoyable
as
the
placid
idleness
of
fellside
and
at
fellside
lady
lesbia
could
not
always
avoid
him
without
a
intention
so
he
tasted
the
sweetness
of
her
society
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
was
good
for
his
peace
if
the
case
were
indeed
as
hopeless
as
lady
mary
declared
he
strolled
about
the
grounds
with
her
he
drank
the
sweet
melody
of
her
voice
in
heine
tenderest
ballads
he
read
to
her
on
the
sunlit
lawn
in
the
lazy
afternoon
hours
he
played
billiards
with
her
he
was
her
faithful
attendant
at
afternoon
tea
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
study
of
her
character
which
to
his
charmed
eyes
seemed
the
perfection
of
pure
and
placid
womanhood
there
might
perhaps
be
some
lack
of
passion
and
of
force
in
this
nature
a
marked
absence
of
that
impulsive
feeling
which
is
a
charm
in
some
women
but
this
want
was
atoned
for
by
sweetness
of
character
and
hammond
argued
that
in
these
calm
natures
there
is
often
an
unsuspected
depth
a
latent
force
a
grandeur
of
soul
which
only
reveals
itself
in
the
great
ordeals
of
life
so
john
hammond
hung
about
the
luxurious
at
fellside
in
a
manner
which
his
friend
maulevrier
ridiculed
as
unmanly
had
no
idea
you
were
such
a
tame
cat
he
said
when
we
were
salmon
fishing
in
canada
anybody
had
told
me
you
could
loll
about
a
all
day
listening
to
a
girl
squalling
and
reading
novels
i
should
have
believed
a
word
of
it
had
plenty
of
roughing
on
the
shores
of
the
lawrence
answered
hammond
idleness
in
a
is
an
agreeable
variety
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
john
hammond
state
of
mind
could
long
remain
unperceived
by
the
keen
eyes
of
the
dowager
she
saw
the
gradual
dawning
of
his
love
she
saw
the
glow
of
its
meridian
she
was
pleased
to
behold
this
proof
of
lesbia
power
over
the
heart
of
man
so
would
she
conquer
the
man
foredoomed
to
be
her
husband
when
the
coming
time
should
bring
them
together
but
agreeable
as
the
fact
of
this
first
conquest
might
be
as
an
evidence
of
lesbia
supremacy
among
women
the
situation
was
not
without
its
peril
and
lady
maulevrier
felt
that
she
could
no
longer
defer
the
duty
of
warning
her
granddaughter
she
had
wished
if
possible
to
treat
the
thing
lightly
to
the
very
last
so
that
lesbia
should
never
know
there
had
been
danger
she
had
told
her
a
few
days
ago
that
those
drives
and
walks
with
the
two
young
men
were
undignified
even
although
guarded
by
the
fräulein
substantial
presence
are
making
yourself
too
much
a
companion
to
maulevrier
and
his
friend
said
the
dowager
you
do
not
take
care
you
will
grow
like
mary
would
do
anything
in
the
world
to
avoid
replied
lesbia
walks
and
drives
have
been
very
pleasant
hammond
is
extremely
clever
and
can
talk
about
everything
her
colour
heightened
ever
so
little
as
she
spoke
of
him
an
indication
duly
observed
by
lady
maulevrier
doubt
the
man
is
clever
all
adventurers
are
clever
and
you
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
this
man
is
an
adventurer
a
mere
sponge
and
toady
of
maulevrier
is
nothing
of
the
sponge
or
the
toady
in
his
manner
protested
lady
lesbia
with
a
still
deeper
blush
the
warm
glow
of
angry
feeling
dear
child
what
do
you
know
of
such
people
or
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
they
are
generated
the
sponge
and
toady
of
is
not
the
clumsy
fawning
wretch
you
have
read
about
in
novels
he
can
flatter
adroitly
and
feed
upon
his
friends
and
yet
maintain
a
show
of
manhood
and
independence
i
wager
hammond
trip
to
canada
did
not
cost
him
sixpence
and
that
he
hardly
opened
his
purse
all
the
time
he
was
in
germany
my
brother
wants
the
company
of
a
friend
who
is
much
poorer
than
himself
he
must
pay
for
it
argued
lesbia
think
maulevrier
is
lucky
to
have
such
a
companion
as
mr
hammond
yet
even
while
she
so
argued
lady
lesbia
felt
in
some
manner
humiliated
by
the
idea
that
this
man
who
so
palpably
worshipped
her
was
too
poor
to
pay
his
own
travelling
expenses
poets
and
philosophers
may
say
what
they
will
about
the
grandeur
of
plain
living
and
high
thinking
but
a
young
woman
thinks
better
of
the
plain
liver
who
is
not
compelled
to
plainness
by
want
of
cash
the
idea
of
narrow
means
of
dependence
upon
the
capricious
generosity
of
a
wealthy
friend
is
not
without
its
humiliating
influence
lesbia
was
barely
civil
to
hammond
that
evening
when
he
praised
her
singing
and
she
refused
to
join
in
a
four
game
proposed
by
maulevrier
albeit
she
and
hammond
had
beaten
mary
and
maulevrier
the
evening
before
with
much
exultant
hilarity
hammond
had
been
at
fellside
nearly
a
month
and
maulevrier
was
beginning
to
talk
about
a
move
further
northward
there
was
a
grouse
moor
in
argyleshire
which
the
two
young
men
talked
about
as
belonging
to
some
unnamed
friend
of
the
earl
which
they
had
thought
of
shooting
over
before
the
grouse
season
was
ended
hartfield
has
property
in
argyleshire
said
the
dowager
when
they
talked
of
these
shootings
you
know
his
estate
mr
hammond
knows
that
there
is
such
a
place
i
daresay
replied
maulevrier
replying
for
his
friend
you
do
not
know
lord
hartfield
perhaps
said
her
ladyship
not
arrogantly
but
still
in
a
tone
which
implied
her
conviction
that
john
hammond
would
not
be
with
earls
in
scotland
or
elsewhere
yes
i
know
him
by
sight
every
one
in
argyleshire
knows
him
by
sight
a
young
man
in
his
position
must
be
widely
known
is
he
popular
so
father
and
i
were
friends
many
years
ago
said
lady
maulevrier
with
a
faint
sigh
you
ever
heard
if
he
resembles
his
father
believe
not
i
am
told
he
is
like
his
mother
family
he
ought
to
be
handsome
lady
florence
ilmington
was
a
famous
beauty
they
were
sitting
in
the
after
dinner
the
room
dimly
lighted
by
lamps
the
windows
wide
open
to
the
summer
sky
and
moonlit
lake
in
that
subdued
light
lady
maulevrier
looked
a
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
the
classical
modelling
of
her
features
and
the
delicacy
of
her
complexion
were
unimpaired
by
time
while
those
traces
of
thought
and
care
which
gave
age
to
her
face
in
the
broad
light
of
day
were
invisible
at
night
john
hammond
contemplated
that
refined
and
placid
countenance
with
profound
admiration
he
remembered
how
her
ladyship
grandson
had
compared
her
with
the
sphinx
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
studied
her
proud
and
tranquil
beauty
that
there
was
indeed
something
of
the
mysterious
the
unreadable
in
that
countenance
and
that
beneath
its
heroic
calm
there
might
be
the
ashes
of
tragic
passion
the
traces
of
a
struggle
with
fate
that
such
a
woman
so
beautiful
so
gifted
so
well
fitted
to
shine
and
govern
in
the
great
world
should
have
been
content
to
live
a
long
life
of
absolute
seclusion
in
this
remote
valley
was
in
itself
a
social
mystery
which
must
needs
set
an
observant
young
man
wondering
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
that
lady
maulevrier
loved
a
country
life
that
she
had
made
fellside
her
earthly
paradise
and
had
no
desire
beyond
it
the
fact
remained
that
it
was
not
in
lady
maulevrier
temperament
to
be
satisfied
with
such
an
existence
that
falcon
eye
was
never
meant
to
gaze
for
ever
upon
one
narrow
range
of
mountain
and
lake
that
lip
was
made
to
speak
among
the
great
ones
of
the
world
lady
maulevrier
was
particularly
gracious
to
her
grandson
friend
this
evening
maulevrier
spoke
so
decisively
about
a
speedy
migration
northward
seemed
so
inclined
to
regret
the
time
wasted
since
the
twelfth
of
the
month
that
she
thought
the
danger
was
past
and
she
could
afford
to
be
civil
she
really
liked
the
young
man
had
no
doubt
in
her
own
mind
that
he
was
a
gentleman
in
the
highest
and
broadest
sense
of
the
word
but
not
in
the
sense
which
made
him
an
eligible
husband
for
either
of
her
granddaughters
lesbia
was
in
a
pensive
mood
this
evening
she
sat
in
the
verandah
looking
dreamily
at
the
lake
and
at
fairfield
yonder
a
broad
green
slope
silvered
with
moonlight
and
seeming
to
stretch
far
away
into
unfathomable
distance
if
one
could
but
take
one
lover
by
the
hand
and
go
wandering
over
those
mystic
moonlit
slopes
into
some
new
unreal
world
where
it
would
not
matter
whether
a
man
were
rich
or
poor
or
where
there
should
be
no
such
things
as
rank
and
state
to
be
won
or
lost
lesbia
felt
as
if
she
would
like
to
live
out
her
life
in
dreamland
reality
was
too
hard
too
much
set
round
by
difficulties
and
sacrifices
while
lesbia
was
losing
herself
in
that
lady
maulevrier
unbent
considerably
to
john
hammond
and
talked
to
him
with
more
appearance
of
interest
in
his
actual
self
and
in
his
own
affairs
than
she
had
manifested
hitherto
although
she
had
been
uniformly
courteous
she
asked
him
his
plans
for
the
future
had
he
chosen
a
profession
he
told
her
that
he
had
not
he
meant
to
devote
himself
to
literature
and
politics
not
that
rather
vague
inquired
her
ladyship
is
vague
at
first
literature
now
as
an
amusement
no
doubt
it
is
delightful
but
as
a
profession
does
literature
ever
pay
have
been
such
cases
i
suppose
so
walter
scott
gibbon
macaulay
froude
those
made
money
no
doubt
but
there
is
a
suspicion
of
hopelessness
in
the
idea
of
a
young
man
starting
in
life
intending
to
earn
his
bread
by
literature
one
remembers
chatterton
i
should
have
thought
that
in
your
case
the
law
or
the
church
would
have
been
better
in
the
latter
maulevrier
might
have
been
useful
to
you
he
is
patron
of
three
or
four
livings
are
too
good
even
to
think
of
such
a
thing
said
hammond
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
a
political
career
i
must
swim
or
sink
in
that
sea
lady
maulevrier
looked
at
him
with
a
compassionate
smile
poor
young
man
no
doubt
he
thought
himself
a
genius
and
that
doors
which
had
remained
shut
to
everybody
else
would
turn
on
their
hinges
directly
he
knocked
at
them
she
was
sincerely
sorry
for
him
young
clever
enthusiastic
and
doomed
to
bitterest
disappointment
have
parents
perhaps
who
are
ambitious
for
you
a
mother
who
thinks
her
son
a
statesman
said
her
ladyship
kindly
no
that
incentive
to
ambition
is
wanting
in
my
case
i
have
neither
father
nor
mother
living
is
very
sad
no
doubt
that
fact
has
been
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
you
and
maulevrier
believe
it
has
i
hope
providence
will
smile
upon
your
path
what
may
i
shall
never
forget
the
happy
weeks
i
have
spent
at
fellside
said
hammond
your
ladyship
gracious
hospitality
he
took
up
the
beautiful
hand
white
to
transparency
showing
the
delicate
tracing
of
blue
veins
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
it
in
chivalrous
worship
of
age
and
womanly
dignity
lady
maulevrier
smiled
upon
him
with
her
calm
grave
smile
she
would
have
liked
to
say
shall
be
welcome
again
at
fellside
but
she
felt
that
the
man
was
dangerous
not
while
lesbia
remained
single
could
she
court
his
company
if
maulevrier
brought
him
she
must
tolerate
his
presence
but
she
would
do
nothing
to
invite
that
danger
there
was
no
music
that
evening
maulevrier
and
mary
were
playing
billiards
fräulein
müller
was
sitting
in
her
corner
working
at
a
counterpane
lesbia
came
in
from
the
verandah
presently
and
sat
on
a
low
stool
by
her
grandmother
and
talked
to
her
in
soft
cooing
accents
inaudible
to
john
hammond
who
sat
a
little
way
off
turning
the
leaves
of
the
and
this
went
on
till
eleven
the
regular
hour
for
retiring
when
mary
came
in
from
the
and
told
hammond
that
maulevrier
was
waiting
for
a
smoke
and
a
talk
then
candles
were
lighted
and
the
ladies
all
departed
leaving
john
hammond
and
his
friend
with
the
house
to
themselves
they
played
a
fifty
game
and
smoked
and
talked
till
the
stroke
of
midnight
by
which
time
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
not
another
creature
awake
in
the
house
maulevrier
put
out
the
lamps
in
the
and
then
they
went
softly
up
the
shadowy
staircase
and
parted
in
the
gallery
the
earl
going
one
way
and
his
friend
the
other
the
house
was
large
and
roomy
spread
over
a
good
deal
of
ground
lady
maulevrier
having
insisted
upon
there
being
only
two
stories
the
servants
rooms
were
all
in
a
side
wing
corresponding
with
those
older
buildings
which
had
been
given
over
to
steadman
and
his
wife
and
among
the
villagers
of
grasmere
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
a
wide
panelled
corridor
extended
from
one
end
of
the
house
to
the
other
it
was
lighted
from
the
roof
and
served
as
a
gallery
for
the
display
of
a
small
and
choice
collection
of
modern
art
which
her
ladyship
had
acquired
during
her
long
residence
at
fellside
here
too
in
sheraton
cabinets
were
those
treasures
of
old
english
china
which
lady
maulevrier
had
inherited
from
past
generations
her
ladyship
rooms
were
situated
at
the
southern
end
of
this
corridor
her
being
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
house
with
windows
commanding
two
magnificent
views
one
across
the
lake
and
the
village
of
grasmere
to
the
green
slopes
of
fairfield
the
other
along
the
valley
towards
rydal
water
this
and
the
adjoining
boudoir
were
the
prettiest
rooms
in
the
house
and
no
one
wondered
that
her
ladyship
should
spend
so
much
of
her
life
in
the
luxurious
seclusion
of
her
own
apartments
john
hammond
went
to
his
room
which
was
on
the
same
side
of
the
house
as
her
ladyship
but
he
was
in
no
disposition
for
sleep
he
opened
the
casement
and
stood
looking
out
upon
the
moonlit
lake
and
the
quiet
village
where
one
solitary
light
shone
like
a
faint
star
in
a
cottage
window
amidst
that
little
cluster
of
houses
by
the
old
church
once
known
as
kirktown
beyond
the
village
rose
gentle
slopes
crowned
with
foliage
and
above
those
wooded
crests
appeared
the
grand
outline
of
the
hills
surrounding
and
guarding
easedale
lovely
valley
as
the
hills
surrounded
jerusalem
of
old
he
looked
at
that
delicious
landscape
with
eyes
that
hardly
saw
its
beauty
the
image
of
a
lovely
face
came
between
him
and
all
the
glory
of
earth
and
sky
think
she
likes
me
he
was
saying
to
himself
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
that
told
me
the
time
was
come
when
the
thought
died
unfinished
in
his
brain
through
the
silent
house
across
the
placid
lake
there
rang
a
wild
shrill
cry
that
froze
the
blood
in
his
veins
or
seemed
so
to
freeze
it
a
shriek
of
agony
and
in
a
woman
voice
it
rang
out
from
an
open
window
near
his
own
the
sound
seemed
close
to
his
ear
chapter
x
bitterness
of
things
too
sweet
only
for
an
instant
did
john
hammond
stand
motionless
after
hearing
that
unearthly
shriek
in
the
next
moment
he
rushed
into
the
corridor
expecting
to
hear
the
sound
repeated
to
find
himself
face
to
face
with
some
midnight
robber
whose
presence
had
caused
that
wild
cry
of
alarm
but
in
the
corridor
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
no
open
door
suggested
the
entrance
of
an
intruder
the
lamps
showed
only
the
long
empty
gallery
he
stood
still
for
a
few
moments
listening
for
voices
footsteps
the
rustle
of
garments
but
there
was
nothing
nothing
yes
a
groan
a
moaning
sound
as
of
infinite
pain
this
time
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
came
it
came
from
lady
maulevrier
room
the
door
was
ajar
and
he
could
see
the
faint
light
of
the
within
that
fearful
cry
had
come
from
her
ladyship
room
she
was
in
peril
or
pain
of
some
kind
convinced
of
this
one
fact
hammond
had
not
an
instant
hesitation
he
pushed
open
the
door
without
compunction
and
entered
the
room
prepared
to
behold
some
terrible
scene
but
all
was
quiet
as
death
itself
no
midnight
burglar
had
violated
the
sanctity
of
lady
maulevrier
apartment
the
soft
steady
light
of
the
shone
on
the
face
of
the
sleeper
yes
all
was
quiet
in
the
room
but
not
in
that
sleeper
soul
the
broad
white
brow
was
painfully
contracted
the
lips
drawn
down
and
distorted
the
delicate
hand
half
hidden
by
the
deep
valenciennes
ruffle
clutched
the
coverlet
with
convulsive
force
sigh
after
sigh
burst
from
the
agitated
breast
john
hammond
gazed
upon
the
sleeper
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
uncertain
what
to
do
was
this
dreaming
only
or
was
it
some
kind
of
seizure
which
called
for
medical
aid
at
her
ladyship
age
the
idea
of
paralysis
was
not
too
improbable
for
belief
if
this
was
a
dream
then
indeed
the
visions
of
lady
maulevrier
head
upon
her
bed
were
more
terrible
than
the
dreams
of
common
mortals
in
any
case
hammond
felt
that
it
was
his
duty
to
send
some
attendant
to
lady
maulevrier
some
member
of
the
household
who
was
familiar
with
her
ladyship
habits
her
own
maid
if
that
person
could
be
unearthed
easily
he
knew
that
the
servants
slept
in
a
separate
wing
but
he
thought
it
more
than
likely
that
her
ladyship
personal
attendant
occupied
a
room
near
her
mistress
he
went
back
to
the
corridor
and
looked
round
him
in
doubt
for
a
moment
or
two
close
against
her
ladyship
door
there
was
a
swing
door
covered
with
red
cloth
which
seemed
to
communicate
with
the
old
part
of
the
house
john
hammond
pushed
this
door
and
it
yielded
to
his
hand
revealing
a
passage
narrow
and
low
he
thought
it
likely
that
lady
maulevrier
maid
might
occupy
a
room
in
this
wing
as
he
pushed
open
the
door
he
saw
an
elderly
man
coming
towards
him
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
with
the
appearance
of
having
huddled
on
his
clothes
hastily
heard
that
scream
said
hammond
it
was
her
ladyship
i
suppose
nightmare
she
is
subject
to
nightmare
is
very
dreadful
her
whole
countenance
was
convulsed
just
now
when
i
went
into
her
room
to
see
what
was
wrong
i
was
almost
afraid
of
a
fit
of
some
kind
ought
not
her
maid
to
go
to
her
wants
no
assistance
the
man
answered
coolly
was
only
a
dream
it
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
been
awakened
by
a
shriek
like
that
it
is
a
kind
of
nightmare
no
doubt
and
it
passes
off
in
a
few
minutes
and
leaves
her
sleeping
calmly
he
went
to
her
ladyship
door
pushed
it
open
a
little
way
and
looked
in
she
is
sleeping
as
quietly
as
an
infant
he
said
shutting
the
door
softly
as
he
spoke
am
very
glad
but
surely
she
ought
to
have
her
maid
near
her
at
night
if
she
is
subject
to
those
attacks
is
no
attack
i
tell
you
it
is
nothing
but
a
dream
answered
steadman
impatiently
you
were
frightened
just
as
i
was
or
you
would
not
have
got
up
and
dressed
said
hammond
looking
at
the
man
suspiciously
he
had
heard
of
this
old
servant
steadman
who
was
supposed
to
enjoy
more
of
her
ladyship
confidence
than
any
one
else
in
the
household
but
he
had
never
spoken
to
the
man
before
that
night
i
came
it
was
my
duty
to
come
knowing
her
ladyship
habits
i
am
a
light
sleeper
and
that
scream
woke
me
instantly
if
her
maid
were
wanted
i
should
call
her
i
am
a
kind
of
you
see
sir
seem
to
be
a
very
faithful
dog
have
been
in
her
ladyship
service
more
than
forty
years
i
have
reason
to
be
faithful
i
know
her
ladyship
habits
better
than
any
one
in
the
house
i
know
that
she
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
her
early
life
and
i
believe
the
memory
of
it
comes
back
upon
her
sometimes
in
her
dreams
and
gets
the
better
of
her
it
was
memory
that
wrung
that
agonised
shriek
from
her
just
now
her
recollections
of
the
past
must
be
very
terrible
sir
there
is
a
skeleton
in
every
house
answered
james
steadman
gravely
this
was
exactly
what
maulevrier
had
said
under
the
yew
trees
which
wordsworth
planted
sir
said
steadman
you
are
sure
that
lady
maulevrier
may
be
left
safely
that
there
is
no
fear
of
illness
of
any
kind
sir
it
was
only
a
bad
dream
sir
steadman
went
back
to
his
own
quarters
hammond
heard
him
draw
the
bolts
of
the
swing
door
thus
cutting
off
all
communication
with
the
corridor
the
clock
on
the
staircase
struck
two
as
hammond
returned
to
his
room
even
less
inclined
for
sleep
than
when
he
left
it
strange
that
nocturnal
disturbance
of
a
mind
which
seemed
so
tranquil
in
the
day
or
was
that
tranquillity
only
a
mask
which
her
ladyship
wore
before
the
world
and
was
the
bitter
memory
of
events
which
happened
forty
years
ago
still
a
source
of
anguish
to
that
highly
strung
nature
are
some
minds
which
can
not
forget
john
hammond
said
to
himself
as
he
meditated
upon
her
ladyship
character
and
history
story
of
her
husband
crime
may
still
be
fresh
in
her
memory
though
it
is
only
a
tradition
for
the
outside
world
his
crime
may
have
involved
some
deep
wrong
done
to
herself
some
outrage
against
her
love
and
faith
as
a
wife
one
of
the
stories
maulevrier
spoke
of
the
other
day
was
of
a
wicked
woman
influence
upon
the
governor
a
much
more
likely
story
than
that
of
any
traffic
in
british
interests
or
british
honour
which
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
a
man
in
lord
position
if
the
scandal
was
of
a
darker
kind
a
guilty
wife
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
a
husband
the
horror
of
the
thing
may
have
made
a
deeper
impression
on
lady
maulevrier
than
even
her
nearest
and
dearest
dream
of
and
that
superb
calm
which
she
wears
like
a
royal
mantle
may
be
maintained
at
the
cost
of
struggles
which
tear
her
and
then
at
night
when
the
will
is
dormant
when
the
nervous
system
is
no
longer
ruled
by
the
power
of
waking
intelligence
the
old
familiar
agony
returns
the
hated
images
flash
back
upon
the
brain
and
in
proportion
to
the
fineness
of
the
temperament
is
the
intensity
of
the
dreamer
pain
and
then
he
went
on
to
reflect
upon
the
long
monotonous
years
spent
in
that
lonely
house
shut
in
from
the
world
by
those
everlasting
hills
albeit
the
house
was
an
ideal
house
set
in
a
landscape
of
infinite
beauty
the
monotony
must
be
none
the
less
oppressive
for
a
mind
burdened
with
dark
memories
weighed
down
by
sorrows
which
could
seek
no
relief
from
sympathy
which
could
never
become
familiarised
by
discussion
wonder
that
a
woman
of
lady
maulevrier
intellect
should
not
have
better
known
how
to
treat
her
own
malady
thought
hammond
hammond
inquired
after
her
ladyship
health
next
morning
and
was
told
she
was
perfectly
well
is
in
capital
spirits
said
lady
lesbia
is
pleased
with
the
contents
of
yesterday
lord
denyer
the
son
of
one
of
her
oldest
friends
has
been
making
a
great
speech
at
liverpool
in
the
conservative
interest
and
her
ladyship
thinks
we
shall
have
a
change
of
parties
before
long
general
shuffle
of
the
cards
said
maulevrier
looking
up
from
his
breakfast
sure
i
hope
so
i
no
politician
but
i
like
a
row
hope
you
are
a
conservative
hammond
said
lesbia
had
hoped
you
would
have
known
that
ever
so
long
ago
lady
lesbia
lesbia
blushed
at
his
tone
which
was
almost
a
reproach
suppose
i
ought
to
have
understood
from
the
general
tenor
of
your
conversation
she
said
i
am
terribly
stupid
about
politics
i
take
so
little
interest
in
them
i
am
always
hearing
that
we
are
being
badly
governed
that
the
men
who
legislate
for
us
are
stupid
or
wicked
yet
the
world
seems
to
go
on
somehow
and
we
are
no
worse
is
just
the
same
with
sport
said
maulevrier
rainy
spring
we
are
told
that
all
the
young
birds
have
been
drowned
or
that
the
has
decimated
the
fathers
and
mothers
and
that
we
shall
have
nothing
to
shoot
but
when
august
comes
the
birds
are
there
all
the
same
is
the
nature
of
mankind
to
complain
said
hammond
and
abel
were
the
first
farmers
and
you
see
one
of
them
grumbled
they
were
rather
lively
at
breakfast
that
morning
maulevrier
last
breakfast
but
one
for
he
had
announced
his
determination
of
going
to
scotland
next
day
other
fellows
would
shoot
all
the
birds
if
he
dawdled
any
longer
mary
was
in
deep
despondency
at
the
idea
of
his
departure
yet
she
laughed
and
talked
with
the
rest
and
perhaps
lesbia
felt
a
little
moved
at
the
thought
of
losing
hammond
maulevrier
would
come
back
to
mary
but
john
hammond
was
hardly
likely
to
return
their
parting
would
be
for
ever
need
sit
quite
in
my
pocket
molly
said
maulevrier
to
his
younger
sister
like
to
make
the
most
of
you
now
you
are
going
away
sighed
mary
dear
how
dull
we
shall
all
be
when
you
are
gone
a
bit
of
it
you
will
have
some
perhaps
before
the
snow
is
on
the
hills
at
the
very
mention
of
lady
mary
bright
young
face
crimsoned
and
maulevrier
began
to
laugh
in
a
provoking
way
with
glances
at
his
younger
sister
you
ever
hear
of
molly
hammond
he
asked
mary
tried
to
put
her
hand
before
his
lips
but
it
was
useless
should
i
tell
he
exclaimed
was
quite
a
heroic
adventure
you
must
know
our
here
is
rather
a
peculiar
institution
very
good
in
its
way
but
strictly
local
no
horse
could
live
among
our
hills
so
we
hunt
on
foot
and
as
the
pace
is
good
and
the
work
hard
nobody
who
starts
with
the
hounds
is
likely
to
be
in
at
the
death
except
the
huntsmen
we
are
all
mad
for
the
sport
and
off
we
go
over
the
hills
and
far
away
picking
up
a
fresh
field
as
we
go
the
ploughman
leaves
his
plough
and
the
shepherd
leaves
his
flock
and
the
farmer
leaves
his
thrashing
to
follow
us
in
every
field
we
cross
we
get
fresh
blood
while
those
who
join
us
at
the
start
fall
off
by
degrees
well
it
happened
one
day
late
in
october
when
there
were
long
ridges
of
snow
on
helvellyn
and
patches
of
white
on
fairfield
mistress
mary
here
must
needs
take
her
bamboo
staff
and
start
for
the
striding
edge
it
was
just
the
day
upon
which
she
might
have
met
her
death
easily
on
that
perilous
point
but
happily
something
occurred
to
divert
her
juvenile
fancy
for
scarcely
had
she
got
to
the
bottom
of
dolly
waggon
pike
you
know
dolly
said
hammond
with
a
nod
had
she
neared
the
base
of
dolly
waggon
when
she
heard
the
huntsman
horn
and
the
hounds
at
full
cry
streaming
along
towards
dunmail
raise
off
flew
molly
all
among
the
butcher
boys
and
men
and
squireens
of
the
district
racing
over
the
rugged
fields
clambering
over
the
low
stone
walls
up
hill
down
hill
shouting
when
the
others
shouted
never
losing
sight
of
the
waving
sterns
winding
and
doubling
and
still
going
upward
and
upward
till
she
stood
panting
and
puffing
like
a
young
grampus
on
the
top
of
seat
sandal
still
all
among
the
butcher
boys
and
the
farmer
men
and
the
guides
and
the
squireens
her
frock
torn
to
ribbons
her
hat
lost
in
a
ditch
her
hair
streaming
down
her
back
and
every
inch
of
her
from
her
nose
downwards
splashed
and
spattered
with
mire
and
clay
what
a
spectacle
for
gods
and
men
guides
and
butcher
boys
and
there
she
stood
with
the
sun
going
down
beyond
coniston
old
man
and
a
walk
between
her
and
fellside
lady
mary
said
hammond
looking
at
her
very
kindly
but
mary
did
not
see
that
friendly
glance
which
betokened
sympathy
rather
than
scorn
she
sat
silent
and
very
red
with
drooping
eyelids
thinking
her
brother
horribly
cruel
for
thus
publishing
her
foolishness
indeed
exclaimed
maulevrier
came
crawling
home
after
dark
footsore
and
draggled
looking
like
a
beggar
girl
and
as
evil
fate
would
have
it
her
ladyship
who
so
seldom
goes
out
must
needs
have
been
taking
afternoon
tea
at
the
vicarage
upon
that
particular
occasion
and
was
driving
up
the
avenue
as
mary
crawled
to
the
gate
the
storm
that
followed
may
be
more
easily
imagined
than
described
was
years
and
years
ago
expostulated
mary
looking
very
angry
need
have
made
such
a
fuss
about
it
but
in
those
days
she
still
had
hopes
of
civilising
you
answered
maulevrier
then
she
has
abandoned
all
endeavour
in
that
direction
and
has
given
you
over
to
your
own
devices
and
me
since
then
you
have
become
a
chartered
libertine
you
have
letters
of
mark
do
care
what
you
call
me
said
mary
only
know
that
i
am
very
happy
when
you
are
at
home
and
very
miserable
when
you
are
away
is
hardly
kind
of
you
to
say
that
lady
mary
remonstrated
fräulein
müller
who
up
to
this
point
had
been
busily
engaged
with
muffins
and
gooseberry
jam
i
do
mean
that
any
one
is
unkind
to
me
or
uses
me
badly
said
mary
only
mean
that
my
life
is
empty
when
maulevrier
is
away
and
that
i
am
always
longing
for
him
to
come
back
again
thought
you
adored
the
hills
and
the
lake
and
the
villagers
and
your
pony
and
maulevrier
dogs
said
lesbia
faintly
contemptuous
but
one
wants
something
human
to
love
answered
mary
making
it
very
obvious
that
there
was
no
warmth
of
affection
between
herself
and
the
feminine
members
of
her
family
she
had
not
thought
of
the
significance
of
her
speech
she
was
very
angry
with
maulevrier
for
having
held
her
up
to
ridicule
before
hammond
who
already
despised
her
as
she
believed
and
whose
contempt
was
more
galling
than
it
need
have
been
considering
that
he
was
a
mere
casual
visitor
who
would
go
away
and
return
no
more
never
till
his
coming
had
she
felt
her
deficiencies
but
in
his
presence
she
writhed
under
the
sense
of
her
unworthiness
and
had
an
almost
agonising
consciousness
of
all
those
faults
which
her
grandmother
had
told
her
about
so
often
with
not
the
slightest
effect
in
those
days
she
had
not
cared
what
lady
maulevrier
or
any
one
else
might
say
of
her
or
think
of
her
she
lived
her
life
and
defied
fortune
she
was
worse
than
her
reputation
she
felt
it
a
bitter
thing
that
she
had
grown
to
the
age
of
womanhood
lacking
all
those
graces
and
accomplishments
which
made
her
sister
adorable
and
which
might
make
even
a
plain
woman
charming
never
till
john
hammond
coming
had
she
felt
a
pang
of
envy
in
the
contemplation
of
lesbia
beauty
or
lesbia
grace
but
now
she
had
so
keen
a
sense
of
the
difference
between
herself
and
her
sister
that
she
began
to
fear
that
this
cruel
pain
must
indeed
be
that
lowest
of
all
vices
even
the
difference
in
their
gowns
was
a
source
of
humiliation
to
her
how
lesbia
was
looking
her
loveliest
this
morning
in
a
gown
that
was
all
lace
and
soft
madras
muslin
flowing
while
tailor
gown
with
its
trim
tight
bodice
horn
buttons
and
kilted
skirt
seemed
to
cry
aloud
that
it
had
been
made
for
a
tomboy
and
this
tailor
gown
was
a
costume
to
which
mary
had
condemned
herself
by
her
own
folly
only
a
year
ago
moved
by
an
artistic
admiration
for
lesbia
delicate
breakfast
gowns
mary
had
told
her
grandmother
that
she
would
like
to
have
something
of
the
same
kind
whereupon
the
dowager
who
did
not
take
the
faintest
interest
in
mary
toilet
but
who
had
a
stern
sense
of
justice
replied
do
not
think
lesbia
frocks
and
your
habits
will
agree
but
you
can
have
some
pretty
morning
gowns
if
you
like
and
the
order
had
been
given
for
a
confection
in
muslin
and
lace
for
lady
mary
mary
came
down
to
breakfast
one
bright
june
morning
in
the
new
frock
feeling
very
proud
of
herself
and
looking
very
pretty
feathers
make
fine
birds
said
fräulein
müller
should
hardly
have
known
you
wish
you
would
always
dress
like
that
said
lesbia
really
look
like
a
young
lady
and
mary
danced
about
on
the
lawn
feeling
and
quite
in
love
with
her
own
elegance
when
a
sudden
uplifting
of
canine
voices
in
the
distance
had
sent
her
flying
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
the
terrier
pack
in
the
kennel
there
was
riot
and
confusion
ahab
was
demolishing
angelina
absalom
had
agamemnon
in
a
deadly
grip
in
hand
mary
rushed
to
the
rescue
and
laid
about
her
like
the
knights
of
old
utterly
forgetful
of
her
frock
she
soon
succeeded
in
restoring
order
but
the
madras
muslin
the
breton
lace
had
perished
in
the
conflict
she
left
the
kennel
panting
and
in
rags
and
tatters
some
of
the
muslin
and
lace
hanging
about
her
in
strips
a
yard
long
but
the
greater
part
remaining
in
the
possession
of
the
terriers
who
had
mauled
and
munched
her
finery
to
their
hearts
content
while
she
was
reading
the
riot
act
she
went
back
to
the
house
bowed
down
by
shame
and
confusion
and
marched
straight
to
the
dowager
what
the
terriers
have
done
to
me
grandmother
she
said
with
a
sob
is
all
my
own
fault
of
course
i
ought
not
to
have
gone
near
them
in
that
stupid
muslin
please
forgive
me
for
being
so
foolish
i
am
not
fit
to
have
pretty
frocks
think
my
dear
you
can
now
have
no
doubt
that
the
tailor
gowns
are
fittest
for
you
answered
lady
maulevrier
with
crushing
placidity
have
tried
the
experiment
of
dressing
you
like
lesbia
and
you
see
it
does
not
answer
tell
kibble
to
throw
your
new
gown
in
the
and
please
let
me
hear
no
more
about
it
after
this
dismal
failure
mary
could
not
feel
herself
in
having
to
wear
tailor
gowns
all
the
year
round
she
was
allowed
cotton
frocks
for
very
warm
weather
and
she
had
pretty
gowns
for
evening
wear
but
her
usual
attire
was
cloth
or
linsey
woolsey
made
by
the
local
tailor
sometimes
maulevrier
ordered
her
a
gown
or
a
coat
from
his
own
man
in
conduit
street
and
then
she
felt
herself
smart
and
fashionable
and
even
the
local
tailor
contrived
to
make
her
gowns
prettily
having
a
great
appreciation
of
her
straight
willowy
figure
and
deeming
it
a
privilege
to
work
for
her
so
that
hitherto
mary
had
felt
very
well
content
with
her
cloth
and
linsey
but
now
that
john
hammond
so
obviously
admired
lesbia
delicate
raiment
poor
mary
began
to
think
her
woollen
gowns
odious
after
breakfast
mary
and
maulevrier
went
straight
off
to
the
kennels
his
lordship
had
numerous
instructions
to
give
on
this
last
day
and
his
lieutenant
had
to
receive
and
register
his
orders
lesbia
went
to
the
garden
with
her
book
and
with
fräulein
the
inevitable
fräulein
as
hammond
thought
her
in
close
attendance
it
was
a
lovely
morning
sultry
albeit
september
had
just
begun
the
tennis
lawn
which
had
been
levelled
on
one
side
of
the
house
was
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
shrubberies
planted
forty
years
ago
in
the
beginning
of
lady
maulevrier
widowhood
all
loveliest
trees
grew
there
in
perfection
sheltered
by
the
mighty
wall
of
the
mountain
fed
by
the
mists
from
the
lake
larch
and
mountain
ash
and
lawsonian
cyprus
deodara
and
magnolia
arbutus
and
silver
broom
acacia
and
lilac
flourished
here
in
that
rich
beauty
which
made
every
cottage
garden
in
the
happy
district
a
little
paradise
and
here
in
a
recess
at
one
end
of
the
lawn
were
rustic
chairs
and
tables
and
an
umbrella
tent
this
was
lady
lesbia
chosen
retreat
on
summer
mornings
and
a
favourite
place
for
afternoon
tea
hammond
followed
the
two
ladies
to
their
bower
is
to
be
my
last
morning
he
said
looking
at
lesbia
you
think
me
a
great
bore
if
i
spend
it
with
you
shall
think
it
very
nice
of
you
answered
lesbia
without
a
vestige
of
emotion
if
you
will
read
to
us
will
do
any
thing
to
make
myself
useful
what
shall
i
read
you
like
what
do
you
say
to
tennyson
he
is
a
noble
poet
a
teacher
of
all
good
but
too
philosophical
for
my
present
mood
may
i
read
you
some
of
heine
ballads
those
songs
which
you
sing
so
exquisitely
or
rather
some
you
do
not
sing
and
which
will
be
fresher
to
you
my
german
is
far
from
perfect
but
i
am
told
it
is
passable
and
fräulein
müller
can
throw
her
scissors
at
me
when
my
accent
is
too
dreadful
speak
german
beautifully
said
fräulein
wonder
where
you
learned
it
have
been
a
good
deal
in
germany
and
i
had
a
hanoverian
valet
who
was
quite
a
gentleman
and
spoke
admirably
i
think
i
learned
more
from
him
than
from
grammars
or
dictionaries
i
go
and
fetch
heine
a
very
agreeable
person
hammond
is
said
fräulein
when
he
was
gone
shall
quite
miss
him
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
miss
him
said
lesbia
again
without
the
faintest
emotion
the
governess
began
to
think
that
the
ordeal
of
an
agreeable
young
presence
at
fellside
had
been
passed
in
safety
and
that
her
pupil
was
unscathed
she
had
kept
a
close
watch
on
the
two
as
in
duty
bound
she
knew
that
hammond
was
in
love
with
lesbia
but
she
thought
lesbia
was
hammond
came
back
with
a
shabby
little
book
in
his
hand
and
established
himself
comfortably
in
one
of
the
two
beaconsfield
chairs
he
opened
his
book
at
that
group
of
short
poems
called
heimkehr
and
read
here
and
there
as
fancy
led
him
sometimes
the
strain
was
a
brief
passionate
as
the
cry
of
a
soul
in
pain
sometimes
the
verses
were
bitter
and
cynical
sometimes
full
of
tenderest
simplicity
telling
of
childhood
and
youth
and
purity
sometimes
dark
with
hidden
meanings
grim
awful
cold
with
the
chilling
breath
of
the
sometimes
lesbia
heart
beat
a
little
faster
as
hammond
read
for
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
he
who
was
speaking
to
her
and
not
the
dead
poet
an
hour
or
more
passed
in
this
way
fräulein
müller
was
charmed
at
hearing
some
of
her
favourite
poems
asking
now
for
this
little
bit
and
anon
for
another
and
expatiating
upon
the
merits
of
german
poets
in
general
and
heine
in
particular
in
the
pauses
of
the
lecture
she
was
quite
carried
away
by
her
delight
in
the
poet
and
was
so
entirely
uplifted
to
the
ideal
world
that
when
a
footman
came
with
a
message
from
lady
maulevrier
requesting
her
presence
she
tripped
gaily
off
at
once
without
a
thought
of
danger
in
leaving
those
two
together
on
the
lawn
she
had
been
a
faithful
up
to
this
point
but
she
was
now
lulled
into
a
false
sense
of
security
by
the
idea
that
the
time
of
peril
was
all
but
ended
so
she
left
them
but
could
she
have
looked
back
two
minutes
afterwards
she
would
have
perceived
the
unwisdom
of
that
act
no
sooner
had
the
fräulein
turned
the
corner
of
the
shrubbery
than
hammond
laid
aside
his
book
and
drew
nearer
lesbia
who
sat
looking
downward
with
her
eyes
upon
the
delicate
piece
of
fancy
work
which
had
occupied
her
fingers
all
the
morning
this
is
my
last
day
at
fellside
and
you
and
i
may
never
have
a
minute
alone
together
again
while
i
am
here
will
you
come
for
a
little
walk
with
me
on
the
fell
there
is
something
i
must
say
to
you
before
i
go
lesbia
delicate
cheek
grew
a
shade
more
pale
instinct
told
her
what
was
coming
though
never
mortal
man
had
spoken
to
her
of
love
nor
until
now
had
hammond
ever
addressed
her
by
her
christian
name
without
the
ceremonious
prefix
there
was
a
deeper
tone
in
his
voice
a
graver
look
in
his
eyes
than
she
had
ever
noticed
before
she
rose
and
took
up
her
sunshade
and
went
with
him
meekly
through
the
cultivated
shrubbery
of
ornamental
timber
to
the
rougher
pathway
that
wound
through
a
copse
of
scotch
fir
which
formed
the
outer
boundary
of
lady
maulevrier
domain
beyond
the
fir
trees
rose
the
grassy
slope
of
the
hill
on
the
brow
of
which
sheep
were
feeding
deep
down
in
the
hollow
below
the
lawns
and
shrubberries
of
fellside
the
placid
bosom
of
the
lake
shone
like
an
emerald
floor
in
the
sunlight
reflecting
the
verdure
of
the
hill
and
the
white
sheep
dotted
about
here
and
there
there
was
not
a
breath
in
the
air
around
them
as
those
two
sauntered
slowly
side
by
side
in
the
pine
wood
not
a
cloud
in
the
dazzling
blue
sky
above
and
for
a
little
time
they
too
were
silent
as
if
bound
by
a
spell
which
neither
dared
to
break
then
at
last
hammond
spoke
you
know
that
i
love
you
he
began
in
his
low
grave
voice
tremulous
with
feeling
words
i
can
say
can
tell
you
of
my
love
more
plainly
than
my
heart
has
been
telling
you
in
every
hour
of
this
happy
happy
time
that
you
and
i
have
spent
together
i
love
you
as
i
never
hoped
to
love
fervently
completely
believing
that
the
perfection
of
earthly
bliss
will
be
mine
if
i
can
but
win
you
dearest
is
there
such
a
sweet
hope
for
me
are
you
indeed
my
own
as
i
am
yours
heart
and
soul
and
mind
and
being
till
the
last
throb
of
life
in
this
poor
clay
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
but
she
drew
herself
away
from
him
with
a
frightened
look
she
was
very
pale
and
there
was
infinite
distress
in
the
dark
violet
eyes
which
looked
entreatingly
deprecatingly
at
her
lover
dare
not
answer
as
you
would
like
me
to
answer
she
faltered
after
a
painful
pause
am
not
my
own
mistress
my
grandmother
has
brought
me
up
devoted
herself
to
me
almost
and
she
has
her
own
views
her
own
plans
i
dare
not
frustrate
them
would
like
to
marry
you
to
a
man
of
rank
and
fortune
a
man
who
will
choose
you
perhaps
because
other
people
admire
you
rather
than
because
he
himself
loves
you
as
you
ought
to
be
loved
who
will
choose
you
because
you
are
altogether
the
best
and
most
perfect
thing
of
your
year
just
as
he
would
buy
a
yearling
at
newmarket
or
doncaster
her
ladyship
means
you
to
make
a
great
alliance
coronets
not
hearts
are
the
counters
for
her
game
but
lesbia
would
you
in
the
bloom
and
freshness
of
youth
you
with
the
pulses
of
youth
throbbing
at
your
heart
lend
yourself
to
the
calculations
of
age
which
has
lived
its
life
and
forgotten
the
very
meaning
of
love
would
you
submit
to
be
played
as
a
card
in
the
game
of
a
dowager
ambition
trust
me
dearest
in
the
crisis
of
a
woman
life
there
is
one
only
counsellor
she
should
listen
to
and
that
counsellor
is
her
own
heart
if
you
love
me
as
i
dare
to
hope
you
do
trust
in
me
hold
by
me
and
leave
the
rest
to
heaven
i
know
that
i
can
make
your
life
happy
frighten
me
by
your
impetuosity
said
lesbia
you
forget
how
short
a
time
we
have
known
each
other
age
all
my
life
before
the
day
i
saw
you
is
a
dead
dull
blank
as
compared
with
the
magical
hours
i
have
spent
with
you
do
not
even
know
who
and
what
you
are
i
am
a
gentleman
or
i
should
not
be
your
brother
friend
a
poor
gentleman
if
you
like
with
only
my
own
right
arm
to
hew
my
pathway
through
the
wood
of
life
to
the
temple
of
fortune
but
trust
me
only
trust
me
lesbia
and
i
will
so
hew
my
path
as
to
reach
that
temple
look
at
me
love
do
i
look
like
a
man
born
to
fail
she
looked
up
at
him
shyly
with
eyes
that
were
dim
with
tears
he
looked
like
a
tall
straight
as
the
pine
trunks
amongst
which
he
was
standing
a
frame
formed
for
strength
and
activity
a
face
instinct
with
mental
power
dark
eyes
that
glowed
with
the
fire
of
intellect
and
passion
the
sunlight
gave
an
almost
unearthly
radiance
to
the
clear
dark
of
his
complexion
the
curly
brown
hair
cut
close
to
the
finely
shaped
head
the
broad
brow
and
boldly
modelled
features
lesbia
felt
in
her
heart
that
such
a
man
must
be
destined
for
success
born
to
be
a
conqueror
in
all
strifes
a
victor
upon
every
field
i
the
thews
and
sinews
of
a
man
doomed
to
be
beaten
in
the
battle
he
asked
her
dearest
heaven
meant
me
to
succeed
and
with
you
to
fight
for
i
shall
not
be
beaten
by
adverse
fortune
can
you
not
trust
providence
and
me
can
not
disobey
my
grandmother
if
she
will
consent
will
not
consent
you
must
defy
lady
maulevrier
lesbia
if
you
mean
to
reward
my
love
but
i
will
promise
you
this
much
darling
that
if
you
will
be
my
wife
with
your
brother
consent
which
i
am
sure
of
before
i
ask
for
it
within
one
year
of
our
marriage
i
will
find
means
of
reconciling
her
ladyship
to
the
match
and
winning
her
entire
forgiveness
for
you
and
me
are
talking
of
impossibilities
said
lesbia
frowning
do
you
talk
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
child
i
know
hardly
anything
of
the
world
but
i
do
know
the
woman
who
has
reared
and
educated
me
my
grandmother
would
never
forgive
me
if
i
married
a
poor
man
i
should
be
an
outcast
would
be
outcasts
together
happy
outcasts
besides
we
should
not
always
be
poor
i
tell
you
i
am
predestined
to
conquer
fate
we
should
have
to
begin
from
the
beginning
we
should
have
to
begin
from
the
beginning
as
adam
and
eve
did
when
they
left
paradise
are
not
told
in
the
bible
that
they
had
any
happiness
after
that
it
seems
to
have
been
all
trouble
and
weariness
and
toil
and
death
after
the
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
drove
them
out
of
eden
were
together
and
they
must
have
been
happy
oh
lesbia
if
you
do
not
feel
that
you
can
face
poverty
and
the
world
contempt
by
my
side
and
for
my
sake
you
do
not
love
me
love
never
calculates
so
nicely
love
never
fears
the
future
and
yet
you
do
love
me
lesbia
he
said
trying
to
fold
her
in
his
arms
but
again
she
drew
herself
away
from
him
this
time
with
a
look
almost
of
horror
and
stood
facing
him
clinging
to
one
of
the
pine
trunks
like
a
scared
have
no
right
to
say
that
she
said
have
the
divine
right
of
my
own
deep
love
of
heart
which
cries
out
to
heart
do
you
think
there
is
no
magnetic
power
in
true
love
which
can
divine
the
answering
love
in
another
lesbia
call
me
an
insolent
coxcomb
if
you
like
but
i
know
you
love
me
and
that
you
and
i
may
be
utterly
happy
together
oh
why
why
do
you
shrink
from
me
my
beloved
why
withhold
yourself
from
my
arms
oh
love
let
me
hold
you
to
my
heart
let
me
seal
our
betrothal
with
a
kiss
no
no
not
for
the
world
cried
lesbia
maulevrier
would
cast
me
off
for
ever
she
would
curse
me
would
the
curse
of
an
ambitious
woman
weigh
against
my
love
and
i
tell
you
that
her
anger
would
be
only
a
passing
tempest
she
would
forgive
you
you
do
know
her
tell
you
she
would
forgive
you
and
all
would
be
well
with
us
before
we
had
been
married
a
year
why
can
not
you
believe
me
lesbia
i
can
not
believe
impossibilities
even
from
your
lips
she
answered
sullenly
she
stood
before
him
with
downcast
eyes
the
tears
streaming
down
her
pale
cheeks
exquisitively
lovely
in
her
agitation
and
sorrow
yes
she
did
love
him
her
heart
was
beating
passionately
she
was
longing
to
throw
herself
on
his
breast
to
be
folded
upon
that
manly
heart
in
trust
in
that
brave
bright
look
which
seemed
to
defy
fortune
yes
he
was
a
man
born
to
conquer
he
was
handsome
intellectual
powerful
in
all
mental
and
physical
gifts
a
man
of
men
but
he
was
by
his
own
admission
a
very
obscure
and
insignificant
person
and
he
had
no
money
life
with
him
meant
a
long
fight
with
adverse
circumstances
life
for
his
wife
must
mean
patience
submission
long
waiting
upon
destiny
and
perhaps
with
old
age
and
grey
hairs
the
tardy
turning
of
wheel
and
was
she
for
this
to
resign
the
kingdom
that
had
been
promised
to
her
the
giddy
heights
which
she
was
born
to
scale
the
triumphs
and
delights
and
victories
of
the
great
world
yes
lesbia
loved
this
fortuneless
knight
but
she
loved
herself
and
her
prospects
of
promotion
still
better
lesbia
can
you
not
be
brave
for
my
sake
trustful
for
my
sake
god
will
be
good
to
us
if
we
are
true
to
each
other
will
not
be
good
to
me
if
i
disobey
my
grandmother
i
owe
her
too
much
ingratitude
in
me
would
be
doubly
base
i
will
speak
to
her
i
will
tell
her
all
you
have
said
and
if
she
gives
me
the
faintest
encouragement
will
not
that
is
a
foregone
conclusion
tell
her
all
if
you
like
but
let
us
be
prepared
for
the
answer
when
she
denies
the
right
of
your
heart
to
choose
its
own
mate
then
rise
up
in
the
might
of
your
womanhood
and
defy
her
tell
her
i
love
him
and
be
he
rich
or
poor
i
will
share
his
fate
tell
her
boldly
bravely
nobly
as
a
true
woman
should
and
if
she
be
adamant
still
proclaim
your
right
to
disobey
her
worldly
wisdom
rather
than
the
voice
of
your
own
heart
and
then
come
to
me
darling
and
be
my
own
and
the
world
which
you
and
i
will
face
together
shall
not
be
a
bad
world
i
will
answer
for
that
no
trouble
shall
come
near
you
no
humiliation
shall
ever
touch
you
only
believe
in
me
can
believe
in
you
but
not
in
the
impossible
answered
lesbia
with
measured
accents
the
voice
was
but
passing
cold
just
then
there
was
a
rustling
among
the
pine
branches
and
lesbia
looked
round
with
a
startled
air
there
any
one
listening
she
exclaimed
was
that
the
breath
of
heaven
oh
lesbia
if
you
were
but
a
little
less
wise
a
little
more
trustful
do
not
be
a
dumb
idol
say
that
you
love
me
or
do
not
love
me
if
you
can
look
me
in
the
face
and
say
the
last
i
will
leave
you
without
another
word
i
will
take
my
sentence
and
go
but
this
was
just
what
lesbia
could
not
do
she
could
not
deny
her
love
and
yet
she
could
not
sacrifice
all
things
for
her
love
she
lifted
the
heavy
lids
which
veiled
those
lovely
eyes
and
looked
up
at
him
imploringly
me
time
to
breathe
time
to
think
she
said
then
will
you
answer
me
plainly
truthfully
without
a
shadow
of
reserve
remembering
that
the
fate
of
two
lives
hangs
on
your
words
will
it
be
so
then
i
go
for
a
ramble
over
the
hills
and
return
in
time
for
afternoon
tea
i
shall
look
for
you
on
the
tennis
lawn
at
four
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
this
time
she
yielded
herself
to
him
and
the
beautiful
head
rested
for
a
few
moments
upon
his
breast
and
the
soft
eyes
looked
up
at
him
in
confiding
fondness
he
bent
and
kissed
her
once
only
but
a
kiss
that
meant
for
life
and
death
in
the
next
moment
he
was
gone
leaving
her
alone
among
the
pine
trees
chapter
xi
i
were
to
do
as
iseult
did
lady
maulevrier
rarely
appeared
at
luncheon
she
took
some
slight
refection
in
her
among
her
books
and
papers
and
in
the
society
of
her
canine
favourites
whose
company
suited
her
better
at
certain
hours
than
the
noisier
companionship
of
her
grandchildren
she
was
a
studious
woman
loving
the
silent
life
of
books
better
than
the
inane
chatter
of
everyday
humanity
she
was
a
woman
who
thought
much
and
read
much
and
who
lived
more
in
the
past
than
the
present
she
lived
also
in
the
future
counting
much
upon
the
splendid
career
of
her
beautiful
granddaughter
which
should
be
in
a
manner
a
lengthening
out
a
renewal
of
her
own
life
she
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
lesbia
should
reign
supreme
in
the
great
world
a
famous
beauty
and
leader
of
fashion
her
every
act
and
word
inspired
and
directed
by
her
grandmother
who
would
be
the
shadow
behind
the
throne
it
was
possible
nay
probable
that
in
those
days
lady
maulevrier
would
herself
in
society
establish
her
salon
and
draw
around
her
closing
years
all
that
is
wittiest
best
and
wisest
in
the
great
world
her
ladyship
was
reposing
in
her
low
with
a
volume
of
tyndall
on
the
before
her
when
the
door
was
opened
softly
and
lesbia
came
gliding
in
and
seated
herself
without
a
word
on
the
hassock
at
her
grandmother
feet
lady
maulevrier
passed
her
hand
caressingly
over
the
girl
soft
brown
hair
without
looking
up
from
her
book
are
a
late
visitor
she
said
did
you
not
come
to
me
after
breakfast
was
such
a
lovely
morning
we
went
straight
from
the
breakfast
table
to
the
garden
i
did
not
think
you
wanted
me
did
not
want
you
but
i
am
always
glad
to
see
my
pet
what
were
you
doing
in
the
garden
all
the
morning
i
did
not
hear
you
playing
tennis
lady
maulevrier
had
already
interrogated
the
german
governess
upon
this
very
subject
but
she
had
her
own
reasons
for
wishing
to
hear
account
it
was
too
warm
for
tennis
fräulein
and
i
sat
and
worked
and
hammond
read
to
us
did
he
read
ballads
he
reads
german
beautifully
i
daresay
he
was
at
school
in
germany
there
are
cheap
schools
there
to
which
people
send
their
boys
this
was
like
a
thrust
from
a
rusty
knife
hammond
was
at
oxford
lesbia
said
reproachfully
and
then
after
a
longish
pause
she
clasped
her
hands
upon
the
arm
of
lady
chair
and
said
in
a
pleading
voice
hammond
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
only
that
and
pray
did
he
tell
you
what
are
his
means
of
maintaining
lord
maulevrier
sister
in
the
position
to
which
her
birth
entitles
her
inquired
the
dowager
with
crushing
calmness
is
not
rich
indeed
i
believe
he
is
poor
but
he
is
brave
and
clever
and
he
is
full
of
confidence
in
his
power
to
conquer
fortune
doubt
that
is
your
true
adventurer
style
he
confides
implicitly
in
his
own
talents
and
in
somebody
else
banker
hammond
would
make
a
tremendous
figure
in
the
world
i
daresay
and
while
he
was
making
it
your
brother
would
have
to
keep
him
well
my
dear
lesbia
i
hope
you
gave
this
gentleman
the
answer
his
insolence
deserved
or
that
you
did
better
and
referred
him
to
me
i
should
be
glad
to
give
him
my
opinion
of
his
conduct
a
person
admitted
to
this
house
as
your
brother
tolerated
only
on
your
brother
account
such
a
person
nameless
penniless
friendless
except
for
maulevrier
too
facile
patronage
to
dare
to
lift
his
eyes
to
my
granddaughter
it
is
ineffable
insolence
lesbia
crouched
by
her
grandmother
chair
her
face
hidden
from
lady
maulevrier
falcon
eye
every
word
uttered
by
her
ladyship
stung
like
the
knotted
cords
of
a
knout
she
knew
not
whether
to
be
most
ashamed
of
her
lover
or
of
herself
of
her
lover
for
his
obscure
position
his
hopeless
poverty
of
herself
for
her
folly
in
loving
such
a
man
and
she
did
love
him
and
would
fain
have
pleaded
his
cause
had
she
not
been
cowed
by
the
authority
that
had
ruled
her
all
her
life
if
i
thought
you
had
been
silly
enough
degraded
enough
to
give
this
young
man
encouragement
to
have
justified
his
audacity
of
by
any
act
or
word
of
yours
i
should
despise
i
should
detest
you
said
lady
maulevrier
sternly
could
be
more
contemptible
more
hateful
in
a
girl
reared
as
you
have
been
than
to
give
encouragement
to
the
first
comer
to
listen
greedily
to
the
first
adventurer
who
had
the
insolence
to
make
love
to
you
to
be
eager
to
throw
yourself
into
the
arms
of
the
first
man
who
asked
you
that
my
granddaughter
a
girl
reared
and
taught
and
watched
and
guarded
by
me
should
have
no
more
dignity
no
more
modesty
or
womanly
feeling
than
a
barmaid
at
an
inn
lesbia
began
to
cry
do
see
why
a
barmaid
should
not
be
a
good
woman
or
why
it
should
be
a
crime
to
fall
in
love
she
said
in
a
voice
broken
by
sobs
need
not
speak
to
me
so
unkindly
i
am
not
going
to
marry
mr
hammond
you
are
not
that
is
very
good
of
you
i
am
deeply
grateful
for
such
an
assurance
i
like
him
better
than
anyone
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
before
have
seen
so
many
people
you
have
had
such
a
wide
area
for
choice
i
know
i
have
been
kept
like
a
nun
in
a
convent
but
i
do
think
when
i
go
into
the
world
i
shall
ever
see
anyone
i
should
like
better
than
mr
hammond
till
you
have
seen
the
world
before
you
make
up
your
mind
about
that
and
now
lesbia
leave
off
talking
and
thinking
like
a
child
look
me
in
the
face
and
listen
to
me
for
i
am
going
to
speak
seriously
and
with
me
when
i
am
in
earnest
what
is
said
once
is
said
for
ever
lady
maulevrier
grasped
her
granddaughter
arm
with
long
slender
fingers
which
held
it
as
tightly
as
the
grasp
of
a
vice
she
drew
the
girl
slim
figure
round
till
they
were
face
to
face
looking
into
each
other
eyes
the
dowager
eagle
countenance
lit
up
with
impassioned
feeling
severe
awful
as
the
face
of
one
of
the
fatal
sisters
the
avengers
of
blood
the
harbingers
of
doom
i
think
i
have
been
good
to
you
and
kind
to
you
she
said
have
been
all
that
is
kind
and
dear
faltered
lesbia
give
me
measure
for
measure
my
life
has
been
a
hard
one
child
hard
and
lonely
and
loveless
and
joyless
my
son
to
whom
i
devoted
myself
in
the
vigour
of
youth
and
in
the
prime
of
life
never
loved
me
never
repaid
me
for
my
love
he
spent
his
days
far
away
from
me
when
his
presence
would
have
gladdened
my
difficult
life
he
died
in
a
strange
land
of
his
three
children
you
are
the
one
i
took
into
my
heart
i
did
my
duty
to
the
others
i
lavished
my
love
upon
you
do
not
give
me
cursing
instead
of
blessing
do
not
give
me
a
stone
instead
of
bread
i
have
built
every
hope
of
happiness
or
pleasure
in
this
world
upon
you
and
your
obedience
obey
me
be
true
to
me
and
i
will
make
you
a
queen
and
i
will
sit
in
the
shadow
of
your
throne
i
will
toil
for
you
and
be
wise
for
you
you
shall
have
only
to
shine
and
dazzle
and
enjoy
the
glory
of
life
my
beautiful
darling
for
pity
sake
do
not
give
yourself
over
to
folly
not
you
marry
for
love
grandmother
lesbia
lord
maulevrier
and
i
got
on
very
well
together
but
ours
was
no
nobody
in
our
rank
ever
marry
for
love
are
all
marriages
a
mere
exchange
and
barter
there
are
now
and
then
which
often
turn
out
badly
but
my
darling
i
am
not
asking
you
to
marry
for
rank
or
for
money
i
am
only
asking
you
to
wait
till
you
find
your
mate
among
the
noblest
in
the
land
he
may
be
the
handsomest
and
most
accomplished
of
men
a
man
born
to
win
women
hearts
and
you
may
love
him
as
fervently
as
ever
a
village
girl
loved
her
first
lover
i
am
not
going
to
sacrifice
you
or
to
barter
you
dearest
i
mean
to
marry
you
to
the
best
and
noblest
young
man
of
his
day
you
shall
never
be
asked
to
stoop
to
the
unworthy
not
even
if
worthlessness
wore
strawberry
leaves
in
his
cap
and
owned
the
greatest
estate
in
the
land
if
instead
of
waiting
for
this
king
arthur
of
yours
i
were
to
do
as
iseult
did
as
guinevere
did
choose
for
myself
and
guinevere
were
wantons
i
wonder
that
you
can
name
them
in
comparison
with
yourself
i
were
to
marry
a
good
and
honourable
man
who
has
his
place
to
make
in
the
world
would
you
never
forgive
me
mean
hammond
you
may
just
as
well
speak
plainly
said
lady
maulevrier
freezingly
you
were
capable
of
such
idiocy
as
that
lesbia
i
would
pluck
you
out
of
my
heart
like
a
foul
weed
i
would
never
look
upon
you
or
hear
your
name
spoken
or
think
of
you
again
as
long
as
i
lived
my
life
would
not
last
very
long
after
that
blow
old
age
can
not
bear
such
shocks
oh
lesbia
i
have
been
father
and
mother
to
you
do
not
bring
my
grey
hairs
in
sorrow
to
the
grave
lesbia
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
brushed
the
tears
from
her
cheeks
yes
the
very
idea
of
such
a
marriage
was
foolishness
just
now
in
the
pine
wood
carried
away
by
the
force
of
her
lover
passion
by
her
own
softer
feelings
it
had
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
could
count
the
world
well
lost
for
his
sake
but
now
at
lady
maulevrier
feet
she
became
again
true
to
her
training
and
the
world
was
too
much
to
lose
can
i
do
grandmother
she
asked
submissively
despairingly
loves
me
and
i
love
him
how
can
i
tell
him
that
he
and
i
can
never
be
anything
to
each
other
in
this
world
him
to
me
i
will
give
him
his
answer
no
that
will
not
do
i
have
promised
to
answer
him
myself
he
has
gone
for
a
walk
on
the
hills
and
will
come
back
at
four
for
my
answer
down
at
that
table
and
write
as
i
dictate
a
letter
will
be
so
formal
is
the
only
way
in
which
you
can
answer
him
when
he
comes
back
from
his
walk
you
will
have
left
fellside
i
shall
send
you
off
to
st
bees
with
fräulein
you
must
never
look
upon
that
man
face
again
lesbia
brushed
away
a
few
more
tears
and
obeyed
she
had
been
too
well
trained
to
attempt
resistance
defiance
was
out
of
the
question
chapter
xii
greater
cantle
of
the
world
is
lost
the
sky
was
still
cloudless
when
john
hammond
strolled
slowly
up
the
leafy
avenue
at
fellside
he
had
been
across
the
valley
and
up
the
hill
to
easedale
tarn
and
then
by
rough
untrodden
ways
across
a
chaos
of
rock
and
heather
into
a
second
valley
long
narrow
and
sterile
known
as
far
easedale
a
desolate
gorge
a
rugged
cleft
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
the
walk
had
been
long
and
laborious
but
only
in
such
clambering
and
toiling
such
expenditure
of
muscular
force
and
latent
heat
could
the
man
restless
soul
endure
those
long
hours
of
suspense
will
she
answer
me
oh
my
god
how
will
she
answer
he
said
within
himself
as
he
walked
up
the
romantic
winding
road
which
made
so
picturesque
an
approach
to
lady
maulevrier
domain
my
idol
gold
or
clay
how
will
she
come
through
the
crucible
oh
dearest
sweetest
loveliest
only
be
true
to
the
instinct
of
your
womanhood
and
my
cup
will
be
full
of
bliss
and
all
my
days
will
flow
as
sweetly
as
the
burden
of
a
song
but
if
you
prove
heartless
if
you
love
the
wealth
better
than
you
love
me
ah
then
all
is
over
and
you
and
i
are
lost
to
each
other
for
ever
i
have
made
up
my
mind
his
face
settled
into
an
expression
of
indomitable
determination
as
of
a
man
who
would
die
rather
than
be
false
to
his
own
purpose
there
was
no
glow
of
hope
in
his
heart
he
had
no
deep
faith
in
the
girl
he
loved
indeed
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
knew
that
this
being
to
whom
he
had
trusted
his
hopes
of
bliss
was
no
heroine
she
was
a
lovely
loveable
girl
nothing
more
how
would
she
greet
him
when
they
met
presently
on
the
tennis
lawn
with
tears
and
entreaties
and
pretty
little
deprecating
speeches
irresolution
timidity
vacillation
perhaps
hardly
with
heroic
resolve
to
act
and
dare
for
his
sake
there
was
no
one
on
the
tennis
lawn
when
he
went
there
though
the
hour
was
close
at
hand
at
which
lesbia
had
promised
to
give
him
his
answer
he
sat
down
in
one
of
the
low
chairs
glad
to
rest
after
his
long
ramble
having
had
no
refreshment
but
a
bottle
of
and
a
biscuit
at
the
cottage
by
easedale
tarn
he
waited
calmly
as
to
outward
seeming
but
with
a
heavy
heart
it
were
mary
now
whom
i
loved
i
should
have
little
fear
of
the
issue
he
thought
weighing
his
sweetheart
character
as
he
weighed
his
chances
of
success
young
termagant
would
defy
the
world
for
her
lover
he
sat
in
the
summer
silence
for
nearly
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
lady
lesbia
her
workbasket
with
the
work
thrown
carelessly
across
it
was
still
on
the
rustic
table
just
as
she
had
left
it
when
they
went
to
the
pine
wood
waiting
was
weary
work
when
the
bliss
of
a
lifetime
trembled
in
the
balance
and
yet
he
did
not
want
to
be
impatient
she
might
find
it
difficult
to
get
away
from
her
family
perhaps
she
was
closely
watched
and
guarded
as
the
most
precious
thing
at
fellside
at
last
the
clock
struck
five
and
hammond
could
endure
delay
no
longer
he
went
round
by
the
flower
garden
to
the
terrace
before
the
windows
and
through
an
open
window
to
the
lady
maulevrier
was
in
her
accustomed
seat
with
her
own
particular
little
table
magazines
books
newspapers
at
her
side
lady
mary
was
pouring
out
the
tea
a
most
unusual
thing
and
maulevrier
was
sitting
on
a
stool
at
her
feet
with
his
knees
up
to
his
chin
very
warm
and
dusty
eating
pound
cake
the
mischief
have
you
been
hiding
yourself
all
day
jack
he
called
out
as
hammond
appeared
looking
round
the
room
as
he
entered
with
eager
interrogating
eyes
for
that
one
figure
which
was
absent
have
been
for
a
walk
might
have
had
the
civility
to
announce
your
design
and
molly
and
i
would
have
shared
your
peregrinations
am
sorry
that
i
lost
the
privilege
of
your
company
suppose
you
lost
your
luncheon
which
was
of
more
importance
said
maulevrier
you
have
some
tea
asked
mary
who
looked
more
womanly
than
usual
in
a
surah
gown
one
of
her
sunday
gowns
she
had
a
faint
hope
that
by
this
essentially
feminine
apparel
she
might
lessen
the
prejudicial
effect
of
maulevrier
cruel
story
about
the
hammond
answered
absently
hardly
looking
at
mary
and
quite
unconscious
of
her
pretty
gown
yes
he
said
taking
the
cup
and
saucer
and
looking
at
the
door
by
which
he
momently
expected
lady
lesbia
entrance
and
then
as
the
door
did
not
open
he
looked
down
at
mary
very
busy
with
china
teapots
and
a
brass
kettle
which
hissed
and
throbbed
over
a
spirit
lamp
you
have
some
cake
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
gently
grieved
at
the
distress
and
disappointment
in
his
face
am
sure
you
must
be
dreadfully
hungry
in
the
least
thanks
how
came
you
to
be
entrusted
with
those
sacred
vessels
lady
mary
what
has
become
of
fräulein
and
your
sister
have
rushed
off
to
st
bees
grandmother
thought
lesbia
looking
pale
and
out
of
spirits
and
packed
her
off
to
the
seaside
at
a
notice
she
has
left
fellside
asked
hammond
paling
suddenly
as
if
a
man
had
struck
him
maulevrier
do
i
understand
that
lady
lesbia
has
gone
away
he
asked
the
question
in
an
authoritative
tone
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
a
right
to
be
answered
the
dowager
wondered
at
his
surpassing
insolence
granddaughter
has
gone
to
the
seaside
with
her
governess
she
said
haughtily
a
minute
notice
a
minute
notice
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
hesitating
about
any
step
which
i
consider
necessary
for
my
grandchildren
welfare
she
looked
him
full
in
the
face
with
those
falcon
eyes
of
hers
and
he
gave
her
back
a
look
as
resolute
and
every
whit
as
full
of
courage
and
of
pride
he
said
after
a
very
perceptible
pause
doubt
your
ladyship
has
done
wisely
and
i
must
submit
to
your
jurisdiction
but
i
had
asked
lady
lesbia
a
question
and
i
had
been
promised
an
answer
question
has
been
answered
by
lady
lesbia
she
left
a
note
for
you
replied
lady
maulevrier
answered
hammond
briefly
and
he
hurried
from
the
room
without
another
word
the
letter
was
on
the
table
in
his
bedroom
he
had
little
hope
of
any
good
waiting
for
him
in
a
letter
so
written
the
dowager
and
the
world
had
triumphed
over
a
girl
dawning
love
no
doubt
this
was
lesbia
letter
hammond
lady
maulevrier
desires
me
to
say
that
the
proposal
which
you
honoured
me
by
making
this
morning
is
one
which
i
can
not
possibly
accept
and
that
any
idea
of
an
engagement
between
you
and
me
could
result
only
in
misery
and
humiliation
to
both
she
thinks
it
best
under
these
circumstances
that
we
should
not
again
meet
and
i
shall
therefore
have
left
fellside
before
you
receive
this
letter
all
good
wishes
very
faithfully
yours
haselden
faithfully
mine
faithful
to
her
false
training
to
the
worldly
mind
that
rules
her
faithful
to
the
gods
of
this
world
belial
and
mammon
and
the
moloch
fashion
poor
cowardly
soul
she
loves
me
and
owns
as
much
yet
weakly
flies
from
me
afraid
to
trust
the
strong
arm
and
the
brave
heart
of
the
man
who
loves
her
preferring
the
glittering
shams
of
the
world
to
the
reality
of
true
and
honest
love
well
child
i
have
weighed
you
in
the
balance
and
found
you
wanting
would
to
god
it
had
been
otherwise
if
you
had
been
brave
and
bold
for
love
sake
where
is
that
pure
and
perfect
chrysolite
for
which
i
would
have
bartered
you
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
and
sat
with
his
head
bowed
upon
his
folded
arms
and
his
eyes
not
innocent
of
tears
what
would
he
not
have
given
to
find
truth
and
courage
and
scorn
of
the
world
wealth
in
that
heart
which
he
had
tried
to
win
did
he
think
her
altogether
heartless
because
she
so
glibly
renounced
him
no
he
was
too
just
for
that
he
called
her
only
she
was
like
the
cat
in
the
adage
i
dare
not
wait
upon
i
would
but
he
told
himself
with
one
deep
sigh
of
resignation
that
she
was
lost
to
him
for
ever
have
tried
her
and
found
her
not
worth
the
winning
he
said
the
house
even
the
lovely
landscape
smiling
under
his
windows
the
pastoral
valley
smooth
lake
and
willowy
island
seemed
hateful
to
him
he
felt
himself
hemmed
round
by
those
green
hills
by
yonder
brown
and
rugged
wall
of
nabb
scar
stifled
for
want
of
breathing
space
the
landscape
was
lovely
enough
but
it
was
like
a
beautiful
grave
he
longed
to
get
away
from
it
man
would
follow
her
to
st
bees
he
said
will
not
he
flung
a
few
things
into
a
gladstone
bag
sat
down
and
wrote
a
brief
note
to
maulevrier
asking
him
to
make
his
excuses
to
her
ladyship
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
keswick
that
afternoon
and
would
rejoin
his
friend
at
carlisle
this
done
he
rang
for
valet
and
asked
that
person
to
look
after
his
luggage
and
bring
it
on
to
scotland
with
his
master
things
and
then
without
a
word
of
adieu
to
anyone
john
hammond
went
out
of
the
house
with
the
gladstone
bag
in
his
hand
and
shook
the
dust
of
fellside
off
his
feet
he
ordered
a
fly
at
the
prince
of
wales
hotel
and
drove
to
keswick
whence
he
went
on
to
the
lodore
the
gloom
and
spaciousness
of
derwentwater
grey
in
the
gathering
dusk
suited
his
humour
better
than
the
emerald
prettiness
of
grasmere
the
roar
of
the
waterfall
made
music
in
his
ear
he
dined
in
a
private
room
and
spent
the
evening
roaming
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
at
eleven
went
back
to
his
hotel
and
sat
late
into
the
night
reading
heine
and
thinking
of
the
girl
who
had
refused
him
hammond
letter
was
delivered
to
lord
maulevrier
five
minutes
before
dinner
as
he
sat
in
the
with
her
ladyship
and
mary
poor
mary
had
put
on
another
pretty
gown
for
dinner
still
bent
upon
effacing
hammond
image
of
her
as
a
tousled
frantic
creature
in
torn
and
muddy
raiment
she
sat
watching
the
door
just
as
hammond
had
watched
it
three
hours
ago
said
maulevrier
ladyship
has
succeeded
in
driving
my
friend
away
hammond
has
left
fellside
and
begs
me
to
convey
to
you
his
compliments
and
his
grateful
acknowledgment
of
all
your
kindness
hope
i
have
not
been
uncivil
to
him
answered
lady
maulevrier
coldly
you
had
both
made
up
your
minds
to
go
it
can
matter
very
little
that
he
should
go
mary
looked
down
at
the
ribbon
and
lace
on
her
prettiest
frock
and
thought
that
it
mattered
a
great
deal
to
her
yet
if
he
had
stayed
would
he
have
seen
her
frock
or
her
with
his
bodily
eyes
perhaps
but
not
with
the
eyes
of
his
mind
those
eyes
saw
only
lesbia
perhaps
it
hardly
matters
answered
maulevrier
with
suppressed
anger
man
is
not
worth
talking
about
or
thinking
about
what
is
he
only
the
best
truest
bravest
fellow
i
ever
knew
are
shepherds
and
guides
in
grasmere
of
whom
we
could
say
almost
as
much
said
lady
maulevrier
you
would
scarcely
expect
me
to
encourage
one
of
them
to
pay
his
addresses
to
your
sister
pray
spare
us
all
maulevrier
this
business
is
very
well
ended
you
ought
never
to
have
brought
hammond
here
am
sure
of
that
now
i
am
very
sorry
i
did
bring
him
the
man
will
not
die
for
love
a
disappointment
of
that
kind
is
good
for
a
young
man
in
his
position
it
will
preserve
him
from
more
vulgar
entanglements
and
perhaps
from
the
folly
of
a
too
early
marriage
is
a
mighty
philosophical
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
is
the
only
true
way
i
hope
when
you
are
my
age
you
will
have
learnt
to
look
at
everything
in
a
philosophical
spirit
lady
maulevrier
you
have
had
it
all
your
own
way
said
the
young
man
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
an
angry
mood
hope
you
will
never
be
sorry
for
having
come
between
two
people
who
loved
each
other
and
might
have
made
each
other
happy
shall
never
be
sorry
for
having
saved
my
granddaughter
from
an
imprudent
marriage
give
me
your
arm
maulevrier
and
let
me
hear
no
more
about
hammond
we
have
all
had
quite
enough
of
him
said
her
ladyship
as
the
butler
announced
dinner
chapter
xiii
painted
or
not
painted
all
shall
fade
fräulein
müller
and
her
charge
returned
from
st
bees
after
a
sojourn
of
about
three
weeks
upon
that
quiet
shore
but
lady
lesbia
did
not
appear
to
be
improved
in
health
or
spirits
by
the
revivifying
breezes
of
the
ocean
is
a
dull
horrid
place
and
i
was
bored
to
death
there
she
said
when
mary
asked
how
she
had
enjoyed
herself
was
no
question
of
enjoyment
grandmother
took
it
into
her
head
that
i
was
looking
ill
and
sent
me
to
the
sea
but
i
should
have
been
just
as
well
at
fellside
this
meant
that
between
lesbia
and
that
distinctly
inferior
being
her
younger
sister
there
was
to
be
no
confidence
mary
had
watched
the
acted
under
her
eyes
too
closely
not
to
know
all
about
it
and
was
not
inclined
to
be
so
put
off
that
pale
perturbed
countenance
of
john
hammond
those
eager
inquiring
eyes
looking
to
the
door
which
opened
not
had
haunted
mary
waking
thoughts
had
even
mingled
with
the
tangled
web
of
her
dreams
oh
how
could
any
woman
scorn
such
love
to
be
so
loved
and
by
such
a
man
seemed
to
mary
the
perfection
of
earthly
bliss
she
had
never
been
educated
up
to
those
wider
and
loftier
views
of
life
which
teach
a
woman
that
houses
and
lands
place
and
power
are
the
supreme
good
ca
understand
how
you
could
treat
that
man
so
badly
she
exclaimed
one
day
when
she
and
lesbia
were
alone
in
the
library
and
after
she
had
sat
for
ever
so
long
staring
out
of
the
window
meditating
upon
her
sister
cruelty
whom
are
you
speaking
pray
if
you
did
know
of
mr
hammond
pray
how
do
you
know
that
he
is
or
that
i
treated
him
badly
as
to
his
being
that
jumps
to
the
eyes
as
french
books
say
as
for
your
treatment
of
him
i
was
looking
on
all
the
time
and
i
know
how
unkind
you
were
and
i
heard
him
talking
to
you
in
the
that
day
were
listening
cried
lesbia
indignantly
was
not
listening
i
was
passing
by
and
if
people
choose
to
carry
on
their
love
affairs
out
of
doors
they
must
expect
to
be
overheard
i
heard
him
pleading
to
you
telling
you
how
he
would
work
for
you
fight
the
battle
of
life
for
you
asking
you
to
be
trustful
and
brave
for
his
sake
but
you
have
a
heart
of
stone
you
and
grandmother
both
have
hearts
of
stone
i
think
she
must
have
taken
out
your
heart
when
you
were
little
and
put
a
stone
in
its
place
said
lesbia
trying
to
carry
things
with
a
high
hand
albeit
her
very
human
heart
was
beating
passionately
all
the
time
think
you
ought
to
be
very
grateful
to
me
and
grandmother
for
refusing
mr
hammond
grateful
it
leaves
you
a
chance
of
getting
him
for
yourself
and
everybody
can
see
that
you
are
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
him
that
jumps
to
the
eyes
as
you
say
mary
turned
crimson
trembled
with
rage
looked
at
her
sister
as
if
she
would
kill
her
for
a
moment
or
so
and
finally
burst
into
tears
is
not
true
and
it
is
shameful
for
you
to
say
such
a
thing
she
cried
what
a
virago
you
are
mary
well
i
very
glad
it
is
not
true
hammond
is
yes
i
will
be
quite
candid
with
you
he
is
the
only
man
i
am
ever
likely
to
admire
for
his
own
sake
he
is
good
brave
clever
all
that
you
think
him
but
you
and
i
do
not
live
in
a
world
in
which
girls
are
free
to
follow
their
own
inclinations
i
should
break
lady
maulevrier
heart
if
i
were
to
make
a
foolish
marriage
and
i
owe
her
too
much
to
set
her
wishes
at
naught
or
to
make
her
declining
years
unhappy
i
must
obey
her
at
any
cost
to
my
own
feelings
please
never
mention
hammond
name
i
sure
i
had
quite
enough
unhappiness
about
him
see
said
mary
bitterly
is
your
own
pain
you
think
of
not
his
he
may
suffer
so
long
as
you
are
not
worried
are
an
impertinent
chit
retorted
lesbia
you
know
nothing
about
it
after
this
there
was
no
more
said
about
hammond
but
mary
did
not
forget
him
she
wrote
long
letters
to
her
brother
who
was
still
in
scotland
shooting
fishing
killing
something
or
other
daily
in
the
most
approved
fashion
of
an
englishman
taking
his
pleasure
maulevrier
occasionally
repaid
her
with
a
telegram
but
he
was
not
a
good
correspondent
he
declared
that
life
was
too
short
for
summer
was
gone
the
lake
was
no
longer
a
shining
emerald
floor
dotted
with
the
reflection
of
the
flock
upon
the
verdant
slopes
above
it
but
dull
and
grey
of
hue
and
broken
by
wavelets
patches
of
snow
gleamed
on
the
misty
heights
of
helvellyn
and
the
autumn
winds
howled
and
shrieked
around
fellside
in
the
evenings
when
all
the
shutters
were
shut
and
the
outside
world
seemed
little
more
than
an
idea
that
mystic
hour
when
the
sheep
are
slumbering
under
the
starry
sky
and
when
as
the
westmoreland
peasant
believes
the
fairies
help
the
housewife
at
her
those
october
evenings
were
very
long
and
weary
for
lesbia
and
her
sister
lady
maulevrier
read
and
mused
in
her
low
chair
beside
the
fire
with
her
books
piled
upon
her
own
particular
table
and
lighted
by
her
own
particular
lamp
she
talked
very
little
but
she
was
always
gracious
to
her
granddaughters
and
their
governess
and
she
liked
them
to
be
with
her
in
the
evening
lesbia
played
or
sang
or
sat
at
work
at
her
which
occupied
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
and
fräulein
and
mary
had
the
rest
of
the
room
to
themselves
as
it
were
those
two
places
by
the
hearth
being
sacred
as
if
dedicated
to
household
gods
mary
read
immensely
in
those
long
evenings
devouring
volume
after
volume
feeding
her
imagination
with
every
kind
of
nutriment
good
bad
and
indifferent
fräulein
müller
knitted
a
woollen
shawl
which
seemed
to
have
neither
beginning
middle
nor
end
and
was
always
ready
for
conversation
but
there
were
times
when
silence
brooded
over
the
scene
for
long
intervals
and
when
every
sound
of
the
light
dropping
on
the
tiled
hearth
was
distinctly
audible
this
state
of
things
went
on
for
about
three
weeks
after
lesbia
return
from
st
bees
lady
maulevrier
watchful
of
her
granddaughter
all
the
time
though
saying
nothing
she
saw
that
lesbia
was
not
happy
not
as
she
had
been
in
the
time
before
the
coming
of
john
hammond
she
had
never
been
particularly
gay
or
never
gifted
with
the
wild
spirits
and
buoyancy
which
make
girlhood
so
lovely
a
season
to
some
natures
a
time
of
dance
and
song
and
joyousness
a
morning
of
life
steeped
in
the
beauty
and
gladness
of
the
universe
she
had
never
been
gay
as
young
lambs
and
foals
and
fawns
and
kittens
and
puppy
dogs
are
gay
by
reason
of
the
of
delight
within
them
needing
no
stimulus
from
the
outside
world
she
had
been
just
a
little
inclined
to
murmur
at
the
dulness
of
her
life
at
fellside
yet
she
had
borne
herself
with
a
placid
sweetness
which
had
been
lady
maulevrier
delight
but
now
there
was
a
marked
change
in
her
manner
she
was
not
the
less
submissive
and
dutiful
in
her
bearing
to
her
grandmother
whom
she
both
loved
and
feared
but
there
were
moments
of
fretfulness
and
impatience
which
she
could
not
conceal
she
was
captious
and
sullen
in
her
manner
to
mary
and
the
fräulein
she
would
not
walk
or
drive
with
them
or
share
in
any
of
their
amusements
sometimes
of
an
evening
that
studious
silence
of
the
was
suddenly
broken
by
lesbia
weary
sigh
breathed
unawares
as
she
bent
over
her
work
lady
maulevrier
saw
too
that
lesbia
cheek
was
paler
than
of
old
her
eyes
less
bright
there
was
a
heavy
look
that
told
of
broken
slumbers
there
was
a
pinched
look
in
that
oval
check
good
heavens
if
her
beauty
were
to
pale
and
wane
before
society
had
bowed
down
and
worshipped
it
if
this
fair
flower
were
to
fade
untimely
if
this
prize
rose
in
the
garden
of
beauty
were
to
wither
and
decay
before
it
won
the
prize
her
ladyship
was
a
woman
of
action
and
no
sooner
did
this
fear
shape
itself
in
her
mind
than
she
took
steps
to
prevent
the
evil
her
thoughts
foreshadowed
among
those
friends
of
her
youth
and
allies
of
her
house
with
whom
she
had
always
maintained
an
affectionate
correspondence
was
lady
kirkbank
the
fashionable
wife
of
a
sporting
baronet
owner
of
a
castle
in
scotland
a
place
in
yorkshire
a
villa
at
cannes
and
a
fine
house
in
arlington
street
with
an
income
large
enough
for
their
enjoyment
when
lady
diana
angersthorpe
shone
forth
in
the
west
end
world
as
the
acknowledged
belle
of
the
season
the
star
of
georgina
lorimer
was
beginning
to
wane
she
was
the
eldest
daughter
of
colonel
lorimer
a
man
of
good
old
family
and
a
fine
soldier
who
had
fought
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
gough
and
lawrence
and
who
had
contrived
to
make
a
figure
in
society
with
very
small
means
georgina
sisters
had
all
married
well
it
was
a
case
of
necessity
the
colonel
told
them
they
must
either
marry
or
gravitate
ultimately
to
the
workhouse
so
the
miss
lorimers
made
the
best
use
of
their
youth
and
freshness
and
good
offer
refused
was
the
guiding
rule
of
their
young
lives
lucy
married
an
east
india
merchant
and
set
up
a
fine
house
in
porchester
terrace
maud
married
wealth
personified
in
the
person
of
a
leading
member
of
the
tallow
chandlers
company
and
had
her
town
house
and
country
house
and
as
fine
a
set
of
diamonds
as
a
duchess
but
georgina
the
eldest
trifled
with
her
chances
and
her
birthday
beheld
her
pouring
out
her
father
tea
in
a
small
furnished
house
in
a
street
off
portland
place
which
the
colonel
had
hired
on
his
return
from
india
and
which
he
declared
himself
unable
to
maintain
another
year
the
season
is
over
i
shall
give
up
housekeeping
and
take
a
lodging
at
bath
said
colonel
lorimer
you
do
like
bath
all
the
year
round
you
can
stay
with
your
sisters
is
the
last
thing
i
am
likely
to
do
answered
georgina
sisters
were
barely
endurable
when
they
were
single
and
poor
they
are
quite
intolerable
now
they
are
married
and
rich
i
would
sooner
live
in
the
at
the
zoological
than
stay
with
either
lucy
or
maud
rank
envy
retorted
her
father
ca
forgive
them
for
having
done
so
much
better
than
you
ca
forgive
them
for
having
married
snobs
when
i
marry
i
shall
marry
a
gentleman
echoed
the
parent
with
a
sneering
laugh
you
better
say
if
at
this
period
georgina
waning
good
looks
were
in
some
measure
counterbalanced
by
the
cumulative
effects
of
half
a
dozen
seasons
in
good
society
which
had
given
style
to
her
person
ease
to
her
manners
and
sharpness
to
her
tongue
nobody
in
society
said
sharper
or
more
unpleasant
things
than
miss
lorimer
and
by
virtue
of
this
gift
she
got
invited
about
a
great
deal
more
than
she
might
have
done
had
she
been
distinguished
for
sweetness
of
speech
and
manner
georgie
presence
at
a
dinner
table
gave
just
that
pungent
flavour
which
is
like
the
faint
suspicion
of
garlic
in
a
fricassee
or
of
tarragon
in
a
salad
now
in
this
very
season
when
colonel
lorimer
was
inclined
to
speak
of
his
daughter
as
sainte
beuve
wrote
of
musset
as
a
young
woman
with
a
very
brilliant
past
a
lucky
turn
of
events
gave
georgina
a
fresh
start
in
life
which
may
be
called
a
new
departure
lady
diana
angersthorpe
the
belle
of
the
season
took
a
fancy
to
her
was
charmed
with
her
sharp
tongue
and
acute
sense
of
the
ridiculous
the
two
became
fast
friends
and
were
seen
everywhere
together
the
best
men
all
flocked
round
the
beauty
and
all
talked
to
the
beauty
companion
and
before
the
season
was
over
sir
george
kirkbank
who
had
half
made
up
his
mind
to
propose
to
lady
diana
found
himself
engaged
to
that
uncommonly
jolly
girl
lady
diana
friend
georgina
spent
august
and
september
with
lady
di
at
the
marchioness
of
carisbroke
delightful
villa
in
the
isle
of
wight
and
sir
george
kept
his
yacht
at
cowes
all
the
time
and
was
in
constant
attendance
upon
his
fiancée
it
was
george
and
georgie
everywhere
in
october
colonel
lorimer
had
the
profound
pleasure
of
giving
away
his
daughter
before
the
altar
in
george
hanover
square
and
it
may
be
said
of
him
that
nothing
in
his
relations
with
that
young
lady
became
him
better
than
his
manner
of
parting
with
her
so
the
needy
colonel
daughter
became
lady
kirkbank
and
in
the
following
spring
diana
angersthorpe
was
married
at
the
same
to
the
earl
of
maulevrier
the
friends
were
divided
by
distance
and
by
circumstance
as
the
years
rolled
on
but
friendship
was
steadily
maintained
and
a
regular
correspondence
with
lady
kirkbank
whose
pen
was
as
sharp
as
her
tongue
was
one
of
the
means
by
which
lady
maulevrier
had
kept
herself
thoroughly
posted
in
all
those
small
events
unrecorded
by
newspapers
which
make
up
the
secret
history
of
society
it
was
of
her
old
friend
georgie
that
her
ladyship
thought
in
her
present
anxiety
lady
kirkbank
had
more
than
once
suggested
that
lady
maulevrier
granddaughters
should
vary
the
monotony
of
fellside
by
a
visit
to
her
place
near
doncaster
or
her
castle
north
of
aberdeen
but
her
ladyship
had
evaded
these
friendly
suggestions
being
very
jealous
of
any
strange
influence
upon
lesbia
life
now
however
there
had
come
a
time
when
lesbia
must
have
a
complete
change
of
scenery
and
surroundings
lest
she
should
pine
and
dwindle
in
sullen
submission
to
fate
or
else
defy
the
world
and
elope
with
john
hammond
now
therefore
lady
maulevrier
decided
to
accept
lady
hospitality
she
told
her
friend
the
whole
story
with
perfect
frankness
and
her
letter
was
immediately
answered
by
a
telegram
start
for
scotland
will
break
my
journey
by
staying
a
night
at
fellside
and
will
take
lady
lesbia
on
to
kirkbank
with
me
next
day
if
she
can
be
ready
to
go
shall
be
ready
said
lady
maulevrier
she
told
lesbia
that
she
had
accepted
an
invitation
for
her
and
that
she
was
to
go
to
kirkbank
castle
the
day
after
she
was
prepared
for
unwillingness
resistance
even
but
lesbia
received
the
news
with
evident
pleasure
shall
be
very
glad
to
go
she
said
place
is
so
dull
of
course
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
you
grandmother
and
i
wish
you
would
go
with
me
but
any
change
will
be
a
relief
i
think
if
i
had
to
stay
here
all
the
winter
counting
the
days
and
the
hours
i
should
go
out
of
my
mind
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
but
she
wiped
them
away
hurriedly
ashamed
of
her
emotion
dearest
child
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
murmured
lady
maulevrier
believe
me
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
be
very
glad
that
you
conquered
the
first
foolish
inclination
of
your
girlish
heart
i
daresay
when
i
am
eighty
lesbia
answered
impatiently
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
submit
to
the
inevitable
she
had
loved
john
hammond
had
been
as
near
breaking
her
heart
for
him
as
it
was
in
her
nature
to
break
her
heart
for
anybody
but
she
wanted
to
make
a
great
marriage
to
be
renowned
and
admired
she
had
been
reared
and
trained
for
that
and
she
was
not
going
to
belie
her
training
a
visitor
from
the
great
london
world
was
so
rare
an
event
that
there
was
naturally
a
little
excitement
in
the
idea
of
lady
arrival
the
handsomest
and
most
spacious
of
the
spare
bedrooms
was
prepared
for
the
occasion
the
housekeeper
was
told
that
the
dinner
must
be
perfect
there
must
be
nothing
or
ponderous
there
must
be
mind
as
well
as
matter
in
everything
rarely
did
lady
maulevrier
look
at
a
bill
of
fare
but
on
this
particular
morning
she
went
carefully
through
the
menu
and
corrected
it
with
her
own
hand
a
pair
of
brought
lady
kirkbank
and
her
maid
from
windermere
station
in
time
for
afternoon
tea
and
the
friends
who
had
only
met
twice
within
the
last
forty
years
embraced
each
other
on
the
threshold
of
lady
maulevrier
dearest
di
cried
lady
kirkbank
a
delight
to
see
you
again
after
such
ages
and
what
a
too
lovely
spot
you
have
chosen
for
your
retreat
from
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
if
i
could
be
a
recluse
anywhere
it
would
be
amongst
just
such
delicious
surroundings
without
twilight
shades
were
gathering
within
there
was
only
the
light
of
a
fire
and
a
shaded
lamp
upon
the
tea
table
there
was
just
light
enough
for
the
two
women
to
see
each
other
faces
and
the
change
which
time
had
wrought
there
never
did
womanhood
in
advanced
years
offer
a
more
striking
contrast
than
that
presented
by
the
woman
of
fashion
and
the
recluse
lady
maulevrier
was
almost
as
handsome
in
the
winter
of
her
days
as
she
had
been
when
life
was
in
its
spring
the
tall
slim
figure
erect
as
a
dart
the
delicately
chiselled
features
and
alabaster
complexion
the
soft
silvery
hair
the
perfect
hand
whiter
and
more
transparent
than
the
hand
of
girlhood
the
stately
movements
and
bearing
all
combined
to
make
lady
maulevrier
a
queen
among
women
her
brocade
gown
of
a
deep
shade
of
red
with
a
border
of
dark
sable
on
cuffs
and
collar
suggested
a
portrait
by
velasquez
she
wore
no
ornaments
except
the
fine
old
brazilian
diamonds
which
flashed
and
sparkled
upon
her
slender
fingers
if
lady
maulevrier
looked
like
a
picture
in
the
escurial
lady
kirkbank
resembled
a
caricature
in
vie
everything
she
wore
was
in
the
very
latest
fashion
of
the
parisian
that
exaggerated
elegance
of
a
fashion
plate
which
only
the
most
exquisite
of
women
could
redeem
from
vulgarity
plush
brocade
peacock
feathers
golden
bangles
mousquetaire
gloves
a
bonnet
of
purple
plumage
set
off
by
ornaments
of
filagree
gold
an
infantine
little
muff
of
lace
and
wild
flowers
buttercups
and
daisies
and
hair
eyebrows
and
complexion
as
artificial
as
the
flowers
on
the
muff
all
that
art
could
do
to
obliterate
the
traces
of
age
had
been
done
for
georgina
kirkbank
but
seventy
years
are
not
to
be
obliterated
easily
and
the
crow
feet
showed
through
the
bloom
de
ninon
and
the
eyes
under
the
painted
arches
were
glassy
and
haggard
the
carnation
lips
had
a
withered
look
age
was
made
all
the
more
palpable
by
the
artifice
which
would
have
disguised
it
lady
maulevrier
suffered
an
absolute
shock
at
beholding
the
friend
of
her
youth
she
had
not
accustomed
herself
to
the
idea
that
women
in
society
could
raddle
their
cheeks
stain
their
lips
and
play
tricks
before
high
heaven
with
their
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
in
her
own
youth
painted
faces
had
been
the
ghastly
privilege
of
a
class
of
womankind
of
which
the
women
of
society
were
supposed
to
know
nothing
persons
who
showed
their
ankles
and
rouged
their
cheeks
were
to
be
seen
of
an
afternoon
in
bond
street
but
lady
diana
angersthorpe
had
been
taught
to
pass
them
by
as
if
she
saw
them
not
to
behold
without
seeing
these
creatures
outside
the
pale
and
now
she
saw
her
own
dearest
friend
a
person
distinctly
within
the
pale
plastered
with
bismuth
and
stained
with
carmine
and
wearing
hair
of
a
colour
so
obviously
false
and
inharmonious
that
faith
could
hardly
accept
it
as
reality
forty
years
ago
lady
kirkbank
long
ringlets
had
been
darkest
glossiest
brown
she
wore
a
tousled
fringe
of
bright
yellow
piquantly
contrasting
with
vandyke
brown
eyebrows
it
took
lady
maulevrier
some
moments
to
get
over
the
shock
she
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
established
her
friend
in
it
and
then
with
a
little
gasp
she
said
am
charmed
to
see
you
again
georgie
darling
i
was
sure
you
would
be
glad
but
you
must
find
me
awfully
changed
awfully
for
worlds
lady
maulevrier
could
not
have
denied
this
truth
happily
lady
kirkbank
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
is
so
wearing
and
george
and
i
never
seem
to
get
an
interval
of
quiet
kirkbank
is
to
be
full
of
men
next
week
your
granddaughter
will
have
a
good
time
will
be
a
few
women
of
course
yes
there
no
avoiding
that
only
one
does
reckon
them
sir
george
only
counts
his
guns
we
expect
a
splendid
season
i
shall
send
you
some
birds
of
my
own
shooting
shoot
exclaimed
lady
maulevrier
amazed
i
should
think
i
do
what
else
is
there
to
amuse
one
in
scotland
after
the
salmon
fishing
is
over
i
have
never
missed
a
season
for
the
last
thirty
years
unless
we
have
been
abroad
do
innoculate
lesbia
with
your
love
of
sport
you
would
like
her
to
shoot
well
perhaps
you
are
right
it
is
hardly
the
thing
for
a
pretty
girl
with
her
fortune
to
make
it
spoils
the
delicacy
of
the
skin
but
i
afraid
she
find
kirkbank
dull
if
she
does
go
out
with
the
guns
she
can
meet
us
with
the
rest
of
the
women
at
luncheon
we
have
some
capital
picnic
luncheons
on
the
moor
i
can
assure
you
know
she
will
enjoy
herself
with
you
she
has
been
accustomed
to
a
very
quiet
life
here
is
a
lovely
spot
but
i
own
i
can
not
understand
how
you
can
have
lived
here
exclusively
during
all
these
years
you
who
used
to
be
all
life
and
fire
loving
change
action
political
and
diplomatic
society
to
dance
upon
the
crest
of
the
wave
as
it
were
your
whole
nature
must
have
suffered
some
curious
change
their
close
intimacy
of
the
past
warranted
freedom
of
speech
in
the
present
nature
did
undergo
a
change
and
a
severe
one
answered
lady
maulevrier
gloomily
was
that
horrid
and
i
daresay
unfortunate
scandal
about
his
lordship
and
then
the
sad
shock
of
his
death
murmured
lady
kirkbank
sympathetically
women
with
your
youth
and
beauty
would
have
forgotten
the
scandal
and
the
husband
in
a
twelvemonth
and
would
have
made
a
second
marriage
more
brilliant
than
the
first
but
no
indian
widow
who
ever
performed
suttee
was
more
worthy
of
praise
than
you
or
even
that
person
of
ephesus
whose
story
i
have
heard
somewhere
indeed
i
have
always
spoken
of
your
life
as
a
long
suttee
but
you
mean
to
in
society
next
season
i
hope
when
you
present
your
granddaughter
shall
certainly
go
up
to
london
to
present
her
and
possibly
i
may
spend
the
season
in
town
but
i
shall
feel
like
rip
van
winkle
no
you
wo
my
dear
di
you
have
kept
yourself
i
know
even
my
silly
gossiping
letters
may
have
been
of
use
have
been
most
valuable
let
me
give
you
another
cup
of
tea
said
lady
maulevrier
who
had
been
officiating
at
her
own
exquisite
an
arrangement
of
inlaid
woods
antique
silver
and
modern
china
which
her
friend
pronounced
a
perfect
poem
indeed
the
whole
room
was
poetic
lady
kirkbank
declared
and
there
are
many
highly
praised
scenes
which
less
deserve
the
epithet
the
dark
red
walls
and
cedar
dado
the
stamped
velvet
curtains
of
an
indescribable
shade
between
and
olive
the
sheraton
furniture
the
parqueterie
floor
and
persian
the
deep
yet
brilliant
hues
of
crackle
porcelain
and
chinese
cloisonné
enamel
the
artistic
fireplace
with
low
brass
fender
and
recessed
under
the
high
mantelpiece
all
combined
to
form
a
luxurious
and
harmonious
whole
lady
kirkbank
admired
the
in
the
fitful
light
of
the
fire
the
dim
grey
of
deepening
twilight
never
was
a
more
delicious
cell
she
exclaimed
still
i
should
feel
it
a
prison
if
i
had
to
spend
six
weeks
in
the
year
in
it
i
never
stay
more
than
six
weeks
anywhere
out
of
london
and
i
always
find
six
weeks
more
than
enough
the
first
fortnight
is
rapture
the
third
and
fourth
weeks
are
calm
content
the
fifth
is
weariness
the
sixth
a
fever
to
be
gone
i
once
tried
a
seventh
week
at
pontresina
and
i
hated
the
place
so
intensely
that
i
dared
not
go
back
there
for
the
next
three
years
but
now
tell
me
diana
have
you
really
performed
suttee
have
you
buried
yourself
alive
in
this
sweet
spot
deliberately
or
has
the
love
of
retirement
grown
upon
you
and
have
you
become
a
kind
of
believe
i
have
become
a
kind
of
my
retirement
here
has
been
no
sentimental
sacrifice
to
lord
maulevrier
memory
am
glad
to
hear
that
for
i
really
think
the
worst
possible
use
a
woman
can
make
of
her
life
is
in
wasting
it
on
lamentation
for
a
dead
and
gone
husband
life
is
odiously
short
at
the
best
and
it
is
mere
imbecility
to
fritter
away
any
of
our
scanty
portion
upon
the
dead
who
can
never
be
any
the
better
for
our
tears
motive
in
living
at
fellside
was
not
reverence
for
the
dead
and
now
let
us
talk
of
the
gay
world
of
which
you
know
all
the
secrets
have
you
heard
anything
more
about
lord
hartfield
there
is
a
subject
in
which
you
have
reason
to
be
interested
i
have
not
forgotten
the
romance
of
your
youth
that
first
season
in
which
ronald
hollister
used
to
haunt
every
place
at
which
you
appeared
do
you
remember
that
wet
afternoon
at
the
chiswick
when
you
and
he
and
i
took
shelter
in
the
orange
house
and
you
two
made
love
to
each
other
most
audaciously
in
an
atmosphere
of
that
almost
stifled
me
yes
those
were
glorious
days
short
summer
of
gladness
a
brief
dream
sighed
lady
maulevrier
young
lord
hartfield
like
his
father
he
takes
after
the
ilmingtons
but
still
there
is
a
look
of
your
old
sweetheart
yes
i
think
there
is
an
expression
i
have
not
seen
him
for
nearly
a
year
he
is
still
abroad
roaming
about
somewhere
in
search
of
adventures
these
young
men
who
belong
to
the
geographical
and
the
alpine
club
are
hardly
ever
at
home
though
they
may
be
sometimes
lost
to
society
they
are
all
the
more
worthy
of
society
esteem
when
they
do
appear
said
lady
maulevrier
think
there
must
be
an
ennobling
influence
in
alpine
travel
or
in
the
vast
solitudes
of
the
dark
continent
a
man
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
unsophisticated
nature
and
with
the
grandest
forces
of
the
universe
professor
tyndall
writes
delightfully
of
his
alpine
experiences
his
mind
seems
to
have
ripened
in
the
solitude
and
untainted
air
of
the
alps
and
i
believe
lord
hartfield
is
a
young
man
of
very
high
character
and
of
considerable
cultivation
is
he
not
is
a
splendid
young
fellow
i
never
heard
a
word
to
his
disparagement
even
from
those
people
who
pretend
to
know
something
bad
about
everybody
what
a
husband
he
would
make
for
one
of
your
girls
but
those
perfect
arrangements
which
seem
predestined
by
heaven
itself
are
so
rarely
realised
on
earth
answered
the
dowager
lightly
she
was
not
going
to
show
her
cards
even
to
an
old
friend
it
would
be
very
sweet
if
they
were
to
meet
next
season
and
fall
in
love
with
each
other
said
lady
kirkbank
is
enormously
rich
and
i
daresay
your
girls
will
not
be
portionless
may
take
a
modest
place
among
heiresses
answered
lady
maulevrier
have
lived
so
quietly
during
the
last
forty
years
that
i
could
hardly
help
saving
money
nice
sighed
georgie
never
saved
sixpence
in
my
life
and
am
always
in
debt
little
fortune
i
have
saved
is
much
too
small
for
division
lesbia
will
therefore
have
all
i
can
leave
her
mary
has
the
usual
provision
as
a
daughter
of
the
maulevrier
house
i
suppose
lesbia
has
that
provision
also
course
lesbia
i
only
wish
hartfield
were
coming
to
us
for
the
shooting
i
would
engage
he
should
fall
in
love
with
her
kirkbank
is
a
splendid
place
for
but
the
fact
is
i
am
not
very
intimate
with
him
he
is
almost
always
travelling
and
when
he
is
at
home
he
is
not
in
our
set
and
now
my
dear
diana
tell
me
more
about
yourself
and
your
own
life
in
this
delicious
place
is
so
little
to
tell
the
books
i
have
read
the
theories
of
literature
and
art
and
science
which
i
have
adopted
and
dismissed
learnt
and
forgotten
those
are
the
history
of
my
life
the
ideas
of
the
outside
world
reach
me
here
only
in
books
and
newspapers
but
you
who
have
been
living
in
the
world
must
have
so
much
to
say
let
me
be
the
listener
lady
kirkbank
desired
nothing
better
she
rattled
on
for
of
an
hour
about
her
doings
in
the
great
world
her
social
triumphs
the
wonderful
things
she
had
done
for
sir
george
who
seemed
to
be
as
a
puppet
in
her
hands
the
princes
and
princelings
she
had
entertained
the
songs
she
had
composed
the
comedy
she
had
written
for
private
representation
only
albeit
the
haymarket
manager
was
dying
to
produce
it
the
scathing
witticisms
with
which
she
had
withered
her
social
enemies
she
would
have
gone
on
much
longer
but
for
the
gong
which
reminded
her
that
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
later
lady
kirkbank
was
in
the
where
mary
had
retired
to
the
most
shadowy
corner
anxious
to
escape
the
gaze
of
the
fashionable
visitor
but
lady
kirkbank
was
not
inclined
to
take
much
notice
of
mary
brilliant
beauty
the
exquisite
greek
head
the
faultless
complexion
the
deep
violet
eyes
caught
georgina
kirkbank
eye
the
moment
she
had
entered
the
room
and
she
saw
that
this
girl
and
no
other
must
be
the
beauty
the
beloved
and
chosen
grandchild
do
you
do
my
dear
she
said
taking
lesbia
hand
and
then
as
if
with
a
gush
of
warm
feeling
suddenly
drawing
the
girl
towards
her
and
kissing
her
on
both
cheeks
am
going
to
be
desperately
fond
of
you
and
i
hope
you
will
soon
contrive
to
like
me
just
a
little
feel
sure
that
i
shall
like
you
very
much
lesbia
answered
sweetly
am
prepared
to
love
you
as
grandmother
old
friend
my
dear
to
think
that
i
should
ever
be
the
old
friend
of
grandmother
sighed
lady
kirkbank
with
unaffected
regret
i
was
your
age
i
used
to
think
all
old
people
odious
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
live
to
be
one
of
them
you
had
no
dear
grandmother
whom
you
loved
said
lesbia
you
would
have
liked
old
people
for
her
sake
my
love
i
had
no
grandparents
i
had
a
father
and
he
was
anything
beyond
him
in
the
ancestral
line
would
have
been
a
burden
laid
upon
me
greater
than
i
could
bear
as
the
poet
says
dinner
was
announced
and
mary
came
shyly
out
of
her
corner
blushing
deeply
this
is
lady
mary
i
suppose
said
lady
kirkbank
in
an
way
do
you
do
my
dear
i
am
going
to
steal
your
sister
am
very
glad
faltered
mary
mean
i
am
glad
that
lesbia
should
enjoy
herself
some
fine
day
when
lesbia
is
married
and
a
great
lady
i
shall
ask
you
to
come
to
scotland
said
lady
kirkbank
condescendingly
and
then
she
murmured
in
her
friend
ear
as
they
went
to
the
an
english
girl
very
fresh
and
frank
and
nice
which
was
great
praise
for
such
a
young
person
as
lady
mary
do
you
think
of
lesbia
asked
lady
maulevrier
in
the
same
undertone
is
simply
adorable
your
letters
prepared
me
to
expect
beauty
but
not
such
beauty
my
dear
i
thought
the
progress
of
the
human
race
was
all
in
a
downward
line
since
our
time
but
your
granddaughter
is
as
handsome
as
you
were
in
your
first
season
and
that
is
going
very
far
chapter
xiv
yet
lady
kirkbank
carried
off
lesbia
early
next
day
the
girl
radiant
at
the
idea
of
seeing
life
under
new
conditions
she
had
a
few
minutes
serious
talk
with
her
grandmother
before
she
went
you
are
going
into
the
world
said
lady
maulevrier
even
a
country
house
is
the
world
in
little
you
will
have
many
admirers
instead
of
one
but
i
think
i
believe
that
you
will
be
true
to
me
and
to
yourself
need
not
fear
grandmother
i
have
been
an
idiot
but
but
it
was
only
a
passing
folly
and
i
shall
never
be
so
weak
again
lesbia
scornful
lips
and
kindling
eyes
gave
intensity
to
her
speech
it
was
evident
that
she
despised
herself
for
that
one
touch
of
womanly
softness
which
had
made
her
as
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
her
first
wooer
as
any
peasant
girl
in
grasmere
vale
am
delighted
to
hear
you
speak
thus
dearest
said
lady
maulevrier
if
hamilton
hammond
i
mean
should
have
the
audacity
to
follow
you
to
kirkbank
and
to
intrude
himself
upon
you
there
perhaps
to
persecute
you
with
clandestine
addresses
do
not
believe
he
would
do
anything
clandestine
said
lesbia
drawing
herself
up
is
quite
above
that
dear
child
we
know
absolutely
nothing
about
him
he
has
his
way
to
make
in
the
world
unaided
by
family
or
connections
he
is
clever
daring
such
a
man
can
not
help
being
an
adventurer
and
an
adventurer
is
capable
of
anything
i
warn
you
to
beware
of
him
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
see
his
face
again
retorted
lesbia
irritably
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
her
life
was
not
to
be
spoiled
her
brilliant
future
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
john
hammond
but
the
wound
which
she
had
suffered
in
renouncing
him
was
still
fresh
her
feelings
were
still
sore
any
contemptuous
mention
of
him
stung
her
to
the
quick
hope
not
and
you
will
beware
of
other
adventurers
lesbia
men
of
a
worse
stamp
than
hammond
more
experienced
in
ruse
and
iniquity
men
steeped
to
the
lips
in
worldly
knowledge
men
who
look
upon
women
as
mere
counters
in
the
game
of
life
the
world
thinks
that
i
am
rich
and
you
will
no
doubt
take
rank
as
an
heiress
you
will
therefore
be
a
mark
for
every
spendthrift
noble
or
otherwise
who
wants
to
restore
his
broken
fortunes
by
a
wealthy
marriage
and
now
my
dearest
half
my
heart
goes
with
you
nothing
could
induce
me
to
part
with
you
even
for
a
few
weeks
except
the
conviction
that
it
is
for
your
good
we
shall
not
be
parted
next
year
i
hope
grandmother
said
lesbia
affectionately
said
something
about
presenting
me
and
then
leaving
me
in
lady
kirkbank
care
for
the
season
i
should
not
like
that
at
all
i
want
you
to
go
everywhere
with
me
to
teach
me
all
the
mysteries
of
the
great
world
you
have
always
promised
me
that
it
should
be
so
i
have
always
intended
that
it
should
be
so
i
hope
that
it
will
be
so
answered
her
grandmother
with
a
sigh
i
am
an
old
woman
lesbia
and
i
am
rooted
to
this
place
why
should
you
be
rooted
here
what
charm
can
keep
you
here
when
you
are
so
fitted
to
shine
in
society
you
are
old
in
nothing
but
years
and
not
even
old
in
years
in
comparison
with
women
whom
we
hear
of
going
everywhere
and
mixing
in
every
fashionable
amusement
you
are
full
of
fire
and
energy
and
as
active
as
a
girl
why
should
you
not
enjoy
a
london
season
grandmother
pleaded
lesbia
nestling
her
head
lovingly
against
lady
maulevrier
shoulder
should
enjoy
it
dearest
with
you
it
would
be
a
renewal
of
my
youth
to
see
you
shine
and
conquer
i
should
be
as
proud
as
if
the
glory
were
all
my
own
yes
dear
i
hope
that
i
shall
be
a
spectator
of
your
triumphs
but
do
not
let
us
plan
the
future
life
is
so
full
of
changes
remember
what
horace
says
is
a
bore
said
lesbia
hate
a
poet
who
is
always
harping
upon
change
and
death
the
carriage
which
was
to
take
the
travellers
to
windermere
station
was
announced
at
this
moment
and
lesbia
and
her
grandmother
gave
each
other
the
farewell
embrace
like
lady
kirkbank
i
hope
said
lady
maulevrier
as
they
went
towards
the
hall
where
that
lady
was
waiting
for
them
with
lady
mary
and
fräulein
müller
in
attendance
upon
her
seems
very
kind
but
i
should
like
her
better
if
she
did
not
paint
or
if
she
painted
better
dear
child
i
afraid
it
is
the
fashion
of
the
day
just
as
it
was
in
pope
time
and
we
ought
to
think
nothing
about
it
i
suppose
i
shall
get
hardened
in
time
dearest
lesbia
shrieked
lady
kirkbank
from
below
we
have
to
catch
a
train
lesbia
hurried
downstairs
followed
by
lady
maulevrier
who
had
to
bid
her
friend
adieu
the
luggage
had
been
sent
on
in
a
cart
trunks
and
dress
baskets
forming
no
small
item
she
was
so
well
furnished
with
pretty
gowns
of
all
kinds
that
there
had
been
no
difficulty
in
getting
her
ready
for
this
sudden
visit
her
maid
was
on
the
box
beside
the
coachman
lady
kirkbank
attendant
a
frenchwoman
of
who
looked
as
if
she
had
graduated
at
mabille
was
to
occupy
the
back
seat
of
the
landau
lady
mary
looked
after
her
sister
longingly
as
the
carriage
drove
down
the
hill
she
was
going
into
a
new
world
to
see
all
kinds
of
people
clever
people
distinguished
people
musical
artistic
political
people
hunting
and
shooting
people
while
mary
was
to
stay
at
home
all
the
winter
among
the
old
familiar
faces
dearly
as
she
loved
these
hills
and
vales
her
heart
sank
a
little
at
the
thought
of
those
long
lonely
months
days
and
evenings
that
would
be
all
alike
and
which
must
be
spent
without
sympathetic
companionship
and
there
would
be
dreary
days
on
which
the
weather
would
keep
her
a
prisoner
in
her
luxurious
gaol
when
the
mountains
and
the
rugged
paths
beside
the
mountain
streams
would
be
inaccessible
when
she
would
be
restricted
to
fräulein
phlegmatic
society
that
lady
being
stout
and
lazy
fond
of
her
meals
and
given
to
afternoon
slumbers
lesbia
and
mary
were
not
by
any
means
sympathetic
yet
after
all
blood
is
thicker
than
water
and
lesbia
was
intelligent
and
could
talk
of
the
things
mary
loved
which
was
better
than
total
dumbness
even
if
she
generally
took
an
antagonistic
view
of
them
shall
miss
her
dreadfully
thought
mary
as
she
strolled
listlessly
in
the
gardens
where
the
leaves
where
falling
and
the
flowers
fading
wonder
if
she
will
see
hammond
at
lady
kirkbank
mused
mary
he
were
anything
like
a
lover
he
would
find
out
all
about
her
visit
and
seize
the
opportunity
of
her
being
away
from
grandmother
but
then
if
he
had
been
much
of
a
lover
he
would
have
followed
her
to
st
bees
lady
maulevrier
sorely
missed
her
favourite
grandchild
in
a
life
spent
in
such
profound
seclusion
so
remote
from
the
busy
interests
of
the
world
this
beloved
companionship
had
become
a
necessity
to
her
she
had
concentrated
her
affections
upon
lesbia
and
the
girl
absence
made
a
fearful
blank
but
her
ladyship
dignity
was
not
compromised
by
any
outward
signs
of
trouble
or
loss
she
spent
her
mornings
in
her
own
room
reading
and
writing
and
musing
at
her
leisure
she
drove
or
walked
every
fine
afternoon
sometimes
alone
sometimes
attended
by
mary
who
hated
these
stately
drives
and
walks
she
dined
with
mary
except
on
those
rare
occasions
when
there
were
visitors
the
vicar
and
his
wife
or
some
wandering
star
from
other
worlds
mary
lived
in
profound
awe
of
her
grandmother
but
was
of
far
too
frank
a
nature
to
be
able
to
adapt
her
speech
or
her
manners
to
her
ladyship
idea
of
feminine
perfection
she
was
silent
and
shy
under
those
falcon
eyes
but
she
was
still
the
same
mary
the
girl
to
whom
pretence
or
simulation
of
any
kind
was
impossible
letters
came
almost
every
day
from
kirkbank
castle
letters
from
lesbia
describing
the
bright
gay
life
she
was
living
at
that
hospitable
abode
the
excursions
the
rides
the
picnic
luncheons
after
the
sport
the
dinner
parties
the
dances
is
the
most
delightful
house
you
can
imagine
wrote
lesbia
lady
kirkbank
is
an
admirable
hostess
i
have
quite
forgiven
her
for
wearing
false
eyebrows
for
after
all
you
know
one
must
eyebrows
they
are
a
necessity
but
why
does
she
not
have
the
two
arches
alike
they
are
a
pair
and
i
really
think
that
french
maid
of
hers
does
it
on
purpose
lady
kirkbank
is
going
to
write
to
you
to
beseech
you
to
let
me
go
to
cannes
and
monte
carlo
with
her
sir
george
insists
upon
it
he
says
they
both
like
young
society
and
will
be
horribly
vexed
if
i
refuse
to
go
with
them
and
lady
kirkbank
thinks
my
chest
is
just
a
little
weak
i
almost
broke
down
the
other
night
in
that
lovely
little
song
of
jensen
and
that
a
winter
in
the
south
is
just
what
i
want
but
of
course
dear
grandmother
i
wo
ask
you
to
let
me
be
away
so
long
if
you
think
you
will
miss
me
i
think
i
shall
miss
her
repeated
lady
maulevrier
the
girl
no
heart
that
she
can
ask
such
a
question
but
can
i
wonder
at
that
of
what
account
was
i
or
my
love
to
her
father
although
i
sacrificed
myself
for
his
good
name
can
i
expect
that
she
should
be
of
a
different
clay
and
then
meditating
upon
the
events
of
the
summer
that
was
gone
lady
maulevrier
thought
she
renounced
her
first
lover
at
my
bidding
she
renounces
her
love
for
me
at
the
bidding
of
the
world
or
was
it
not
rather
the
fear
of
making
a
bad
marriage
which
influenced
her
in
her
renunciation
of
hammond
it
was
not
obedience
to
me
it
was
not
love
for
me
which
made
her
give
him
up
it
was
the
selfishness
engrained
in
her
race
well
i
have
heaped
my
love
upon
her
because
she
is
fair
and
sweet
and
reminds
me
of
my
own
youth
i
must
let
her
go
and
try
to
be
happy
in
the
knowledge
that
she
is
enjoying
her
life
far
away
from
me
lady
maulevrier
wrote
her
consent
to
the
extension
of
lesbia
visit
and
by
return
of
post
came
a
letter
from
lesbia
which
seemed
brimming
over
with
love
and
which
comforted
the
grandmother
wounded
heart
kirkbank
and
i
are
both
agreed
dearest
that
you
must
join
us
at
cannes
wrote
lesbia
your
age
it
is
very
wrong
of
you
to
spend
a
winter
in
our
horrible
climate
you
can
travel
with
steadman
and
your
maid
lady
kirkbank
will
secure
you
a
charming
suite
of
rooms
at
the
hotel
or
she
would
like
it
still
better
if
you
would
stay
at
her
own
villa
do
consent
to
this
plan
dear
grandmother
and
then
we
shall
not
be
parted
for
a
long
winter
of
course
mary
would
be
quite
happy
at
home
running
wild
lady
maulevrier
sighed
as
she
read
this
letter
sighed
again
and
heavily
as
she
put
it
back
into
the
envelope
alas
how
many
and
many
a
year
had
gone
long
monotonous
colourless
years
since
she
had
seen
that
bright
southern
world
which
she
was
now
urged
to
revisit
in
fancy
she
saw
it
again
the
tideless
sea
of
deepest
sapphire
blue
the
little
wavelets
breaking
on
a
yellow
beach
the
white
triangular
sails
the
woods
full
of
asphodel
and
great
purple
and
white
lilies
the
atmosphere
steeped
in
warmth
and
light
and
perfume
the
glare
of
white
houses
in
the
sun
the
red
and
yellow
blinds
the
pots
of
green
and
orange
and
crimson
clay
with
oleanders
abloom
the
wonderful
glow
of
colour
everywhere
and
upon
all
things
and
then
as
the
eyes
of
the
mind
recalled
these
vivid
images
her
bodily
eyes
looked
out
upon
the
scene
the
mountains
rising
in
a
dark
and
dismal
circle
round
that
sombre
pool
below
walling
her
in
from
the
outer
world
am
at
the
bottom
of
a
grave
she
said
to
herself
am
in
a
living
tomb
from
which
there
is
no
escape
forty
years
forty
years
of
patience
and
hope
for
what
for
dreams
which
may
never
be
realised
for
descendants
who
may
never
give
me
the
price
of
my
labours
yes
i
should
like
to
go
to
my
dear
one
i
should
like
to
revisit
the
south
of
france
to
go
on
to
italy
i
should
feel
young
again
amidst
that
eternal
unchangeable
loveliness
i
should
forget
all
i
have
suffered
but
it
can
not
be
not
yet
not
yet
presently
with
a
smile
of
concentrated
bitterness
she
repeated
the
words
yet
at
my
age
it
must
be
folly
to
dream
of
the
future
and
yet
i
feel
as
if
there
were
half
a
century
of
life
in
me
as
if
i
had
lost
nothing
in
either
mental
or
bodily
vigour
since
i
came
here
forty
years
ago
she
rose
as
she
said
these
words
and
began
to
pace
the
room
with
quiet
firm
step
erect
stately
beautiful
in
her
advanced
years
as
she
had
been
in
her
bloom
and
freshness
only
with
another
kind
of
beauty
an
empress
among
women
the
boast
that
she
had
made
to
herself
was
no
idle
boast
at
years
of
age
her
physical
powers
showed
no
signs
of
decay
her
mental
qualities
were
at
their
best
and
brightest
long
years
of
thought
and
study
had
ripened
and
widened
her
mind
she
was
a
woman
fit
to
be
the
friend
and
counsellor
of
statesmen
the
companion
and
confidant
of
her
sovereign
and
yet
fate
willed
that
she
should
be
buried
alive
in
a
westmoreland
valley
seeing
the
same
hills
and
streams
the
same
rustic
faces
from
year
end
to
year
end
surely
it
was
a
hard
fate
a
heavy
penance
albeit
lesbia
went
straight
from
scotland
to
paris
with
sir
george
and
lady
kirkbank
here
they
stayed
at
the
bristol
for
just
two
days
during
which
her
hostess
went
all
over
the
fashionable
quarter
buying
clothes
for
the
cannes
campaign
and
assisting
lesbia
to
spend
the
hundred
pounds
which
her
grandmother
had
sent
her
for
the
replenishment
of
her
wardrobe
it
is
astonishing
how
little
way
a
hundred
pounds
goes
among
the
dressmakers
and
shoemakers
of
lutetia
had
no
notion
that
clothes
were
so
dear
said
lesbia
when
she
saw
how
little
she
had
got
for
her
money
dear
you
have
two
gowns
which
are
absolutely
replied
lady
kirkbank
you
have
a
corset
which
gives
you
a
figure
which
you
must
forgive
me
for
saying
you
never
had
before
lady
kirkbank
had
to
explain
that
as
applied
to
a
gown
or
bonnet
was
the
same
thing
as
only
a
little
more
so
hope
my
gowns
will
always
be
said
lesbia
meekly
next
evening
they
were
dining
at
cannes
with
the
blue
sea
in
front
of
their
windows
dining
at
a
table
all
abloom
with
orange
flowers
tea
roses
mignonette
waxen
camellias
and
pale
parma
violets
while
lady
maulevrier
and
mary
dined
at
fellside
with
the
feathery
snow
flakes
falling
outside
and
the
world
whitening
all
around
them
next
day
the
world
was
all
white
and
mary
beloved
hills
were
inaccessible
who
could
tell
how
long
they
might
be
covered
the
winding
tracks
hidden
the
narrow
forces
looking
like
black
water
or
molten
iron
against
that
glittering
whiteness
mary
could
only
walk
along
the
road
by
loughrigg
to
the
bench
called
and
be
thankful
from
which
she
looked
with
longing
eyes
across
towards
the
langdale
pikes
and
to
the
sharp
peak
known
as
coniston
old
man
just
visible
above
the
nearer
hills
fräulein
müller
suggested
that
it
was
in
just
such
weather
as
this
that
a
well
brought
up
young
lady
a
young
lady
with
and
should
devote
herself
to
the
improvement
of
her
mind
us
read
german
this
afternoon
said
the
fräulein
we
go
on
with
the
sorrows
of
werther
was
a
fool
cried
mary
book
but
that
you
choose
your
own
book
me
read
heine
fräulein
looked
doubtful
there
were
things
in
heine
an
tone
which
rendered
him
hardly
an
appropriate
poet
for
young
person
but
fräulein
compromised
the
matter
by
letting
mary
read
atta
troll
the
exact
bearing
of
which
neither
of
them
understood
beautifully
hammond
read
heine
that
morning
said
mary
breaking
off
suddenly
from
a
perfectly
automatic
reading
did
not
hear
him
did
you
you
were
not
there
said
the
fräulein
was
not
but
i
heard
him
i
i
was
sitting
on
the
bank
among
the
pine
trees
did
you
not
come
and
sit
with
us
it
would
have
been
more
ladylike
than
to
hide
yourself
behind
the
trees
mary
blushed
crimson
had
been
in
the
kennels
with
maulevrier
i
was
not
fit
to
be
seen
she
said
a
ladylike
admission
replied
the
fräulein
who
felt
that
with
lady
mary
her
chief
duty
was
to
reprove
chapter
xv
all
men
else
i
have
avoided
thee
it
was
afternoon
the
white
hills
yonder
and
all
the
length
of
the
valley
were
touched
here
and
there
with
gleams
of
wintry
sunlight
and
lady
maulevrier
was
taking
her
solitary
walk
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
her
house
a
stately
figure
wrapped
in
a
furred
mantle
tall
erect
moving
with
measured
pace
up
and
down
the
smooth
gravel
path
now
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
walk
the
dowager
stopped
for
a
minute
or
so
and
stood
as
if
in
deep
thought
with
her
eyes
dreamily
contemplating
the
landscape
an
intense
melancholy
shadowed
her
face
as
she
thus
gazed
with
brooding
eyes
on
the
naked
monotony
of
those
wintry
hills
so
had
she
looked
in
many
and
many
a
winter
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
life
was
of
a
piece
with
those
bleak
hills
where
in
the
dismal
winter
time
nothing
living
trod
she
stood
gazing
at
the
sinking
sun
a
fiery
ball
shining
at
the
end
of
a
long
gallery
of
crag
and
rock
like
a
lamp
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
and
as
she
gazed
the
red
round
orb
dropped
suddenly
behind
the
edge
of
a
crag
as
if
she
had
been
an
enchantress
and
had
dismissed
it
with
a
wave
of
her
wand
lord
how
long
how
long
she
said
many
times
have
i
seen
that
sun
go
down
from
this
spot
in
winter
and
summer
in
spring
and
autumn
and
now
that
the
one
being
i
loved
and
cared
for
is
far
away
i
feel
all
the
weariness
and
emptiness
of
my
life
as
she
turned
to
resume
her
walk
she
heard
the
muffled
sound
of
wheels
in
the
road
below
that
road
which
was
completely
hidden
by
foliage
in
summer
but
which
was
now
visible
here
and
there
between
the
leafless
trees
a
carriage
with
a
pair
of
horses
was
coming
along
the
road
from
ambleside
lady
maulevrier
stood
and
watched
until
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
lodge
gate
and
then
when
the
gate
had
been
opened
slowly
ascended
the
winding
drive
to
the
house
she
expected
no
visitor
indeed
there
was
no
one
likely
to
come
to
her
from
the
direction
of
ambleside
her
heart
began
to
beat
heavily
with
the
apprehension
of
coming
evil
what
kind
of
evil
she
knew
not
bad
news
about
her
granddaughter
perhaps
or
about
maulevrier
and
yet
that
could
hardly
be
evil
tidings
of
that
kind
would
have
reached
her
by
telegram
perhaps
it
was
maulevrier
himself
his
movements
were
generally
erratic
lady
maulevrier
hurried
back
to
the
house
she
went
through
the
conservatory
where
the
warm
whiteness
of
azalia
and
spirea
and
arum
lilies
contrasted
curiously
with
the
cold
white
snow
out
of
doors
to
the
hall
where
a
stranger
was
standing
talking
to
the
butler
he
was
a
man
of
foreign
appearance
wearing
a
cloak
lined
with
sables
and
a
sable
cap
which
he
removed
as
lady
maulevrier
approached
he
was
thin
and
small
with
a
clear
olive
complexion
olive
inclining
to
pale
bronze
sleek
raven
hair
and
black
eyes
at
the
first
glance
lady
maulevrier
knew
that
he
was
an
oriental
her
heart
sank
within
her
and
seemed
to
grow
chill
as
death
at
sight
of
him
anything
associated
with
india
was
horrible
to
her
the
stranger
came
forward
to
meet
her
bowing
deferentially
he
had
those
lithe
gliding
movements
which
she
remembered
of
old
when
she
had
seen
princes
and
dignitaries
of
the
east
creeping
shoeless
to
her
husband
feet
your
ladyship
do
me
the
honour
to
grant
me
an
interview
he
said
in
very
good
english
have
travelled
from
london
expressly
for
that
privilege
i
fear
you
have
wasted
your
time
sir
whatever
your
mission
may
be
the
dowager
answered
haughtily
i
am
willing
to
hear
anything
you
may
have
to
say
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
come
this
way
she
moved
towards
the
library
the
butler
preceding
her
to
open
the
door
and
the
stranger
followed
her
into
the
spacious
room
where
coals
and
logs
were
heaped
high
upon
the
wide
dog
stove
deeply
recessed
beneath
the
old
english
mantelpiece
it
was
one
of
the
handsomest
rooms
of
the
house
furnished
with
oak
bookcases
about
seven
feet
high
above
which
vases
of
oriental
ware
and
varied
colouring
stood
boldly
out
against
the
dark
oak
wall
richly
bound
books
in
infinite
variety
testified
to
the
wealth
and
taste
of
the
owner
while
one
side
of
the
room
was
absorbed
by
a
wide
gothic
window
beyond
which
appeared
the
panorama
of
lake
and
mountain
beautiful
in
every
season
a
tawny
velvet
curtain
divided
this
room
from
the
but
there
was
also
a
strong
oak
door
behind
the
curtain
which
was
generally
closed
in
cold
weather
lady
maulevrier
went
over
to
this
door
and
took
the
precaution
to
draw
the
bolt
before
she
seated
herself
in
her
by
the
hearth
she
had
her
own
particular
chair
in
all
the
rooms
she
occupied
a
chair
which
was
sacred
as
a
throne
she
drew
off
her
sealskin
gloves
and
motioned
with
a
slender
white
hand
to
the
stranger
to
be
seated
whom
have
i
the
honour
of
speaking
she
asked
looking
him
through
and
through
with
an
unflinching
gaze
as
she
would
have
looked
at
death
himself
had
the
grim
skeleton
figure
come
to
beckon
her
he
handed
her
a
visiting
card
on
which
was
engraved
asoph
rajah
of
bisnagar
my
memory
does
not
deceive
me
as
to
the
history
of
modern
india
the
territory
from
which
you
take
your
title
has
been
absorbed
into
the
english
dominion
said
lady
maulevrier
was
trafficked
away
years
ago
stolen
filched
from
my
father
but
so
long
as
i
have
power
to
think
and
to
act
i
will
maintain
my
claim
to
that
land
yes
if
only
by
the
empty
mockery
of
a
name
on
a
visiting
card
it
is
a
duty
i
owe
to
myself
as
a
man
which
i
owe
still
more
to
my
murdered
father
you
come
all
the
way
from
london
and
in
such
weather
only
to
tell
me
this
story
she
had
twisted
his
card
between
her
fingers
as
she
listened
to
him
and
now
with
an
action
at
once
careless
and
contemptuous
she
flung
it
upon
the
burning
logs
slight
as
the
action
was
it
was
eloquent
of
scorn
for
the
man
lady
maulevrier
my
mention
of
this
story
with
which
you
are
no
doubt
perfectly
familiar
is
only
a
preliminary
i
have
come
to
claim
my
own
and
to
appeal
to
you
as
a
woman
of
honour
to
do
me
justice
nay
i
will
say
as
a
woman
of
common
honesty
since
there
is
no
nice
point
of
honour
in
question
only
the
plain
laws
of
mine
and
thine
which
i
believe
are
the
same
among
all
nations
and
creeds
i
come
to
you
lady
maulevrier
to
ask
you
to
restore
to
me
the
wealth
which
your
husband
stole
from
my
father
come
to
my
house
to
me
an
old
woman
helpless
defenceless
in
the
absence
of
my
grandson
the
present
earl
to
insult
me
and
insult
the
dead
said
lady
maulevrier
white
as
statuary
marble
and
as
cold
and
calm
come
to
rake
up
old
lies
and
to
fling
them
in
the
face
of
a
solitary
woman
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
do
you
think
that
is
a
noble
thing
to
do
even
in
your
barbarous
eastern
code
of
morals
and
manners
is
the
act
of
a
gentleman
are
no
barbarians
in
the
east
lady
maulevrier
i
come
from
the
cradle
of
civilisation
the
original
fount
of
learning
we
were
scholars
and
gentleman
priests
and
soldiers
two
thousand
years
before
your
british
ancestors
ran
wild
in
their
woods
and
sacrificed
to
their
unknown
gods
or
rocky
altars
reeking
with
human
blood
i
know
the
errand
upon
which
i
have
come
is
not
a
pleasant
one
either
for
you
or
for
me
but
i
come
to
you
strong
in
the
right
of
a
son
to
claim
the
heritage
which
was
stolen
from
him
by
an
infamous
mother
and
her
more
infamous
paramour
will
not
hear
another
word
cried
lady
maulevrier
starting
to
her
feet
livid
with
passion
not
dare
to
pronounce
that
name
in
my
hearing
the
name
of
that
abominable
woman
who
brought
disgrace
and
dishonour
upon
my
husband
and
his
race
who
brought
your
husband
the
wealth
of
my
murdered
father
answered
the
indian
defiantly
not
ignore
that
fact
lady
maulevrier
what
has
become
of
that
fortune
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
money
and
jewels
it
was
known
to
have
passed
into
lord
possession
after
my
father
was
put
away
by
his
paid
instruments
dare
you
bring
that
vile
charge
against
the
dead
are
men
living
in
india
who
know
the
truth
of
that
charge
men
who
were
at
bisnagar
when
my
father
sick
and
heartbroken
was
shut
up
in
his
deserted
harem
hemmed
in
by
spies
and
traitors
men
with
murder
in
their
faces
there
are
those
who
know
tint
he
was
strangled
by
one
of
those
wretches
that
a
grave
was
dug
for
him
under
the
marble
floor
of
his
zenana
a
grave
in
which
his
bones
were
found
less
than
a
year
ago
in
my
presence
and
fitly
entombed
at
my
bidding
he
was
said
to
have
disappeared
of
his
own
free
will
to
have
left
his
palace
under
cover
of
night
and
sought
refuge
from
possible
treachery
in
another
province
but
there
were
those
and
not
a
few
who
knew
the
real
history
of
his
disappearance
who
knew
and
at
the
time
were
ready
to
testify
in
any
court
of
justice
that
he
had
been
got
rid
of
by
the
ranee
agents
and
at
lord
maulevrier
instigation
and
that
his
possessions
in
money
and
jewels
had
been
conveyed
in
the
palankins
that
carried
the
ranee
and
her
women
to
his
lordship
summer
retreat
near
madras
the
ranee
died
at
that
retreat
six
months
after
her
husband
murder
not
without
suspicion
of
poison
and
the
wealth
which
she
carried
with
her
when
she
left
bisnagar
passed
into
his
lordship
possession
had
your
husband
lived
lady
maulevrier
this
story
must
have
been
brought
to
light
there
were
too
many
people
in
madras
interested
in
sifting
the
facts
there
must
have
been
a
public
inquiry
it
was
a
happy
thing
for
you
and
your
race
that
lord
maulevrier
died
before
that
inquiry
had
been
instituted
and
that
many
animosities
died
with
him
lucky
too
for
you
that
i
was
a
helpless
infant
at
the
time
and
that
the
mahratta
adventurer
to
whom
my
father
territory
had
been
transferred
in
the
shuffling
of
cards
at
the
end
of
the
war
was
deeply
concerned
in
hushing
up
the
story
pray
why
have
you
nursed
your
wrath
in
all
these
years
why
do
you
intrude
on
me
after
nearly
half
a
century
with
this
legend
of
rapine
and
murder
for
nearly
half
a
century
i
have
been
kept
in
profound
ignorance
of
my
father
fate
in
ignorance
of
my
race
lord
maulevrier
jealousy
banished
me
from
my
mother
arms
shortly
after
my
father
death
i
was
sent
to
the
south
of
france
under
the
care
of
an
ayah
my
first
memories
are
of
a
monastery
near
marseilles
where
i
was
reared
and
educated
by
a
jesuit
community
where
i
was
baptised
and
brought
up
in
the
roman
catholic
faith
by
the
influence
of
the
jesuit
fathers
i
was
placed
in
a
house
of
commerce
at
marseilles
funds
to
provide
for
my
education
and
establishment
in
life
under
very
modest
conditions
were
sent
periodically
by
an
agent
at
madras
it
was
known
that
i
was
of
east
indian
birth
but
little
more
was
known
about
me
it
was
only
when
years
had
gone
by
and
i
was
a
merchant
on
my
own
account
and
could
afford
to
go
to
india
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
yes
as
much
a
voyage
of
discovery
as
that
of
vasco
de
gama
or
of
drake
that
i
got
from
the
madras
agent
the
clue
which
enabled
me
at
the
cost
of
infinite
patience
and
infinite
labour
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
my
birth
there
is
no
need
to
enter
now
upon
the
details
of
that
story
i
have
overwhelming
documentary
evidence
a
cloud
of
witnesses
to
convince
the
most
sceptical
as
to
who
and
what
i
am
the
documents
are
some
of
them
in
my
valise
at
your
ladyship
service
others
are
at
my
hotel
in
london
ready
for
the
inspection
of
your
ladyship
lawyers
i
do
not
think
you
will
desire
to
invite
a
public
inquiry
or
force
me
to
recover
my
birthright
in
a
court
of
justice
i
believe
that
you
will
take
a
broader
and
nobler
view
of
the
case
and
that
you
will
restore
to
the
wronged
and
abandoned
son
the
fortune
stolen
from
his
murdered
father
dare
you
come
to
me
with
this
tissue
of
lies
how
dare
you
look
me
in
the
face
and
charge
my
dead
husband
with
treachery
and
dishonour
i
believe
neither
in
your
story
nor
in
you
and
i
defy
you
to
the
proof
of
this
vile
charge
against
the
dead
other
words
you
mean
that
you
will
keep
the
money
and
jewels
which
lord
maulevrier
stole
from
my
father
deny
the
fact
that
any
such
jewels
or
money
ever
passed
into
his
lordship
possession
that
vile
woman
your
mother
whose
infamy
cast
a
dark
cloud
over
lord
maulevrier
honour
may
have
robbed
her
husband
may
have
emptied
the
public
treasury
but
not
a
rupee
or
a
jewel
belonging
to
her
ever
came
into
my
possession
i
will
not
bear
the
burden
of
her
crimes
her
existence
spoiled
my
life
banished
me
from
india
a
widow
in
all
but
the
name
and
more
desolate
than
many
widows
maulevrier
was
known
to
leave
india
carrying
with
him
two
large
chests
supposed
to
contain
books
but
actually
containing
treasure
a
man
who
was
in
the
governor
confidence
and
who
had
been
the
in
his
intrigues
confessed
on
his
that
he
had
assisted
in
removing
the
treasure
now
lady
maulevrier
since
your
husband
died
immediately
after
his
arrival
in
england
and
before
he
could
have
had
any
opportunity
of
converting
or
making
away
with
the
valuables
so
appropriated
it
stands
to
reason
that
those
valuables
must
have
passed
into
your
possession
and
it
is
from
your
honour
and
good
feeling
that
i
claim
their
restitution
if
you
deny
the
claim
so
advanced
there
remains
but
one
course
open
to
me
and
that
is
to
make
my
wrongs
public
and
claim
my
right
from
the
law
of
the
land
do
you
suppose
that
any
english
judge
or
english
jury
would
believe
so
wild
a
story
or
countenance
so
vile
an
accusation
against
the
defenceless
demanded
lady
maulevrier
standing
up
before
him
tall
stately
with
flashing
eye
and
scornful
lip
the
image
of
proud
defiance
forward
your
claim
produce
your
documents
your
witnesses
your
confessions
i
defy
you
to
injure
my
dead
husband
or
me
by
your
wild
lies
your
foul
charges
go
to
an
english
lawyer
and
see
what
an
english
law
court
will
do
for
you
and
your
claim
i
will
hear
no
more
of
either
she
rang
the
bell
once
twice
thrice
with
passionate
hand
and
a
servant
flew
to
answer
that
impatient
summons
this
gentlemen
to
his
carriage
she
said
imperiously
the
gentleman
who
called
himself
louis
asoph
bowed
and
retired
without
another
word
as
the
door
closed
upon
him
lady
maulevrier
stood
with
clenched
hands
and
frowning
brow
staring
into
vacancy
her
right
arm
was
outstretched
as
if
she
would
have
waved
the
intruder
away
suddenly
a
strange
numbness
crept
over
that
uplifted
arm
and
it
fell
to
her
side
from
her
shoulder
down
to
her
foot
that
proud
form
grew
cold
and
feelingless
and
dead
and
she
who
had
so
long
carried
herself
as
a
queen
among
women
sank
in
a
senseless
heap
upon
the
floor
chapter
xvi
face
resigned
to
bliss
or
bale
lady
mary
and
the
fräulein
had
been
sitting
in
the
all
this
time
waiting
for
lady
maulevrier
to
come
to
tea
they
heard
her
come
in
from
the
garden
and
then
the
footman
told
them
that
she
was
in
the
library
with
a
stranger
not
even
the
muffled
sound
of
voices
penetrated
the
heavy
velvet
curtain
and
the
thick
oak
door
it
was
only
by
the
loud
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
hall
that
lady
mary
knew
of
the
guest
departure
she
went
to
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
and
was
surprised
to
find
it
bolted
wo
you
come
to
tea
she
asked
timidly
knocking
on
the
oaken
panel
but
there
was
no
reply
she
knocked
again
and
louder
still
no
reply
her
ladyship
is
going
to
take
tea
in
her
own
room
she
said
afraid
to
be
officious
attendance
upon
her
grandmother
at
afternoon
tea
had
been
one
of
lesbia
particular
duties
but
mary
felt
that
she
was
an
unwelcome
substitute
for
lesbia
she
wanted
to
get
a
little
nearer
her
grandmother
heart
if
she
could
but
she
knew
that
her
attentions
were
endured
rather
than
liked
she
went
into
the
hall
where
the
footman
on
duty
was
staring
at
the
light
snowflakes
dancing
past
the
window
perhaps
wishing
he
were
a
snowflake
himself
and
enjoying
himself
in
that
white
whirligig
her
ladyship
having
tea
in
the
asked
mary
the
footman
gave
a
little
start
as
if
awakened
out
of
a
kind
of
trance
the
sheer
vacuity
of
his
mind
might
naturally
slide
into
mesmeric
sleep
he
told
lady
mary
that
her
ladyship
had
not
left
the
library
and
mary
went
in
timidly
wondering
why
her
grandmother
had
not
joined
them
in
the
when
the
stranger
was
gone
the
sky
was
dark
outside
the
wide
windows
white
hills
and
valleys
shrouded
in
the
shades
of
night
the
library
was
only
lighted
by
the
glow
of
the
logs
on
the
hearth
and
in
that
ruddy
light
the
spacious
room
looked
empty
mary
was
turning
to
go
away
thinking
the
footman
had
been
mistaken
when
her
eye
suddenly
lighted
upon
a
dark
figure
lying
on
the
ground
and
then
she
heard
an
awful
stertorous
breathing
and
knew
that
her
grandmother
was
lying
there
stricken
and
helpless
mary
shrieked
aloud
with
a
cry
that
pierced
curtains
and
doors
and
brought
fräulein
and
servants
to
her
help
one
of
the
men
brought
a
lamp
and
among
them
they
lifted
the
smitten
figure
oh
god
how
ghastly
the
face
looked
in
the
lamplight
the
features
drawn
to
one
side
the
skin
livid
ladyship
has
had
a
stroke
said
the
butler
she
dying
faltered
mary
white
as
ashes
grandmother
dear
grandmother
do
look
at
us
like
that
one
of
the
servants
rushed
off
to
the
stables
to
send
for
the
doctor
of
course
being
an
indoor
man
he
no
more
thought
of
going
out
himself
into
the
snowy
night
on
such
an
errand
than
noah
thought
of
going
out
of
the
ark
to
explore
the
face
of
the
waters
in
person
they
carried
lady
maulevrier
to
her
bed
and
laid
her
there
like
a
figure
carved
out
of
stone
she
was
not
unconscious
her
eyes
were
open
and
she
moaned
every
now
and
then
as
if
in
bodily
or
mental
pain
once
she
tried
to
speak
but
had
no
power
to
shape
a
syllable
aright
and
ended
with
a
shuddering
sigh
once
she
lifted
her
left
arm
and
waved
it
in
the
air
as
if
waving
some
one
off
in
fear
or
anger
the
right
arm
indeed
the
whole
of
the
right
side
was
lifeless
motionless
as
a
stone
it
was
a
piteous
sight
to
see
the
beautiful
features
drawn
and
distorted
the
lips
so
accustomed
to
command
mouthing
the
broken
syllables
of
an
unknown
tongue
lady
mary
sat
beside
the
bed
with
clasped
hands
praying
dumbly
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
altered
face
horton
came
as
soon
as
his
stout
mountain
pony
could
bring
him
he
did
not
seem
surprised
at
her
ladyship
condition
and
accepted
the
situation
with
professional
calmness
marked
case
of
hemiplegia
he
said
when
he
had
observed
the
symptoms
she
die
asked
mary
dear
no
she
will
want
great
care
for
a
little
while
but
we
shall
bring
her
round
easily
a
splendid
constitution
a
noble
frame
but
i
think
she
has
overworked
her
brain
a
little
reading
huxley
and
darwin
and
the
german
physiologists
upon
whom
huxley
and
darwin
have
built
themselves
metaphysics
too
schopenhauer
and
the
rest
of
them
a
wonderful
woman
very
few
brains
could
hold
what
hers
has
had
poured
into
it
in
the
last
thirty
years
the
conducting
nerves
between
the
brain
and
the
spinal
marrow
have
been
overworked
too
much
activity
too
constant
a
strain
even
the
rails
and
sleepers
on
the
railroad
wear
out
do
you
know
if
there
excessive
traffic
horton
had
known
mary
from
her
childhood
had
given
her
powder
and
seen
her
safely
through
measles
and
other
infantine
ailments
so
he
was
quite
at
home
with
her
and
at
fellside
generally
lady
maulevrier
had
given
him
a
good
deal
of
her
confidence
during
those
thirty
years
in
which
he
had
practised
as
his
father
partner
and
successor
at
grasmere
he
used
to
tell
people
that
he
owed
the
best
part
of
his
education
to
her
ladyship
who
condescended
to
talk
to
him
of
the
new
books
she
read
and
generally
gave
him
a
volume
to
put
in
his
pocket
when
he
was
leaving
her
be
downhearted
lady
mary
he
said
shall
come
in
two
or
three
times
a
day
and
see
how
things
are
going
on
and
if
i
see
the
slightest
difficulty
in
the
case
i
telegraph
for
jenner
mary
and
the
fräulein
sat
up
with
the
invalid
all
that
night
lady
maulevrier
maid
was
also
in
attendance
and
one
of
the
menservants
slept
in
his
clothes
on
a
couch
in
the
corridor
ready
for
any
emergency
but
the
night
passed
peacefully
the
patient
slept
a
good
deal
and
next
day
there
was
evident
improvement
the
stroke
which
had
prostrated
the
body
which
reduced
the
vigorous
active
frame
to
an
awful
statue
like
stillness
a
quietude
as
of
death
of
itself
had
not
overclouded
the
intellect
lady
maulevrier
lay
on
her
bed
in
her
luxurious
room
with
wide
tudor
windows
commanding
half
the
circle
of
the
hills
and
was
still
the
ruling
spirit
of
the
house
albeit
powerless
to
move
that
slender
hand
the
lightest
wave
of
which
had
been
as
potent
to
command
in
her
little
world
as
royal
or
sceptre
in
the
great
world
outside
now
there
remained
only
one
thing
unimpaired
by
that
awful
shock
which
had
laid
the
stately
frame
low
and
that
was
the
will
and
sovereign
force
of
the
woman
nature
voice
was
altered
speech
was
confused
and
difficult
but
the
strength
of
will
the
supreme
power
of
mind
seemed
undiminished
when
lady
maulevrier
was
asked
if
lesbia
should
be
telegraphed
for
she
replied
no
not
unless
she
was
in
danger
of
sudden
death
should
like
to
see
her
before
i
go
she
said
labouring
to
pronounce
the
words
grandmother
said
mary
tenderly
horton
says
there
is
no
danger
do
not
send
for
her
do
not
even
tell
her
what
has
happened
not
yet
she
will
miss
your
letters
you
must
write
twice
a
week
at
my
dictation
you
must
tell
her
that
i
have
hurt
my
hand
that
i
am
well
but
can
not
use
a
pen
i
would
not
spoil
her
pleasure
for
the
world
grandmother
how
unselfish
you
are
and
maulevrier
shall
he
be
sent
for
he
is
not
so
far
away
said
mary
hoping
her
grandmother
would
say
yes
what
a
relief
what
an
unspeakable
solace
maulevrier
presence
would
be
in
that
dreary
house
smitten
to
a
sudden
and
awful
stillness
as
if
by
the
angel
of
death
i
do
not
want
maulevrier
answered
her
ladyship
impatiently
i
sit
here
and
read
to
you
grandmother
mary
asked
timidly
horton
said
you
were
to
be
kept
very
quiet
and
that
we
were
not
to
let
you
talk
or
talk
much
to
you
but
that
we
might
read
to
you
if
you
like
do
not
wish
to
be
read
to
i
have
my
thoughts
for
company
said
lady
maulevrier
mary
felt
that
this
implied
a
wish
to
be
alone
she
bent
over
the
invalid
pillow
and
kissed
the
pale
cheek
feeling
as
if
she
were
taking
a
liberty
in
venturing
so
much
she
would
hardly
have
done
it
had
lesbia
been
at
home
but
she
had
a
feeling
that
in
lesbia
absence
lady
maulevrier
must
want
somebody
love
even
hers
and
then
she
crept
away
leaving
halcott
the
maid
in
attendance
sitting
at
her
work
at
the
window
furthest
from
the
bed
with
my
thoughts
mused
lady
maulevrier
looking
out
at
the
panorama
of
wintry
hills
white
against
an
iron
sky
thoughts
truly
walled
in
by
the
hills
walled
in
and
hemmed
round
for
ever
this
place
has
always
felt
like
a
grave
and
now
i
know
that
it
my
grave
fräulein
and
lady
mary
and
the
maid
halcott
a
sedate
personage
of
forty
summers
had
all
been
instructed
by
the
doctor
that
lady
maulevrier
was
to
be
kept
profoundly
quiet
she
must
not
talk
much
since
speech
was
likely
to
be
a
painful
effort
with
her
for
some
little
time
she
must
not
be
talked
to
much
by
anyone
least
of
all
must
she
be
spoken
to
upon
any
agitating
topic
life
must
be
made
as
smooth
and
easy
for
her
as
for
a
infant
no
rough
breath
from
the
outer
world
must
come
near
her
she
was
to
see
no
one
but
her
maid
and
her
granddaughter
horton
a
plain
family
man
took
it
for
granted
that
the
granddaughter
was
dear
to
her
heart
and
likely
to
exercise
a
soothing
influence
thus
it
happened
that
although
lady
maulevrier
asked
repeatedly
that
james
steadman
should
be
brought
to
her
she
was
not
allowed
to
see
him
she
whose
will
had
been
paramount
in
that
house
whose
word
had
been
law
was
now
treated
as
a
little
child
while
the
will
was
still
as
strong
the
mind
as
keen
as
ever
would
talk
to
him
of
business
said
horton
when
he
was
told
of
her
ladyship
desire
to
see
steadman
that
can
not
be
allowed
not
for
some
little
time
at
least
is
very
angry
with
us
for
refusing
to
obey
her
said
lady
mary
but
it
is
for
her
own
welfare
she
is
disobeyed
she
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
steadman
which
will
not
keep
till
she
is
better
this
establishment
goes
by
clockwork
mary
wished
it
was
a
little
less
like
clockwork
since
lady
maulevrier
had
been
lying
upstairs
the
voice
which
had
once
ruled
over
the
house
muffled
almost
to
dumbness
the
monotony
of
life
at
fellside
had
seemed
all
the
more
oppressive
the
servants
crept
about
with
stealthier
tread
mary
dared
not
touch
either
piano
or
billiard
balls
and
was
naturally
seized
with
a
longing
to
touch
both
the
house
had
a
darkened
look
as
if
the
shadow
of
doom
overhung
it
during
this
regimen
of
perfect
quiet
lady
maulevrier
was
not
allowed
to
see
the
newspapers
and
mary
was
warned
that
in
reading
to
her
grandmother
she
was
to
avoid
all
exciting
topics
thus
it
happened
that
the
account
of
a
terrible
collision
between
the
scotch
express
and
a
luggage
train
a
little
way
beyond
preston
an
accident
in
which
seven
people
were
killed
and
about
thirty
seriously
hurt
was
not
made
known
to
her
ladyship
and
yet
that
fact
would
have
been
of
intense
interest
and
significance
to
her
since
one
of
those
passengers
whose
injuries
were
fatal
bore
the
name
of
louis
asoph
chapter
xvii
the
spring
comes
slowly
up
this
way
the
wintry
weeks
glided
smoothly
by
in
a
dull
monotony
and
now
lady
maulevrier
still
helpless
still
compelled
to
lie
on
her
bed
or
her
invalid
couch
motionless
as
marble
had
at
least
recovered
her
power
of
speech
was
allowed
to
read
and
to
talk
and
to
hear
what
was
going
on
in
that
metropolitan
world
which
she
seemed
unlikely
ever
to
behold
again
lady
lesbia
was
still
at
cannes
whence
she
wrote
of
her
pleasures
and
her
triumphs
of
flowers
and
sapphire
sea
and
azure
sky
of
all
things
which
were
not
in
the
grey
bleak
mountain
world
that
hemmed
in
fellside
she
was
meeting
many
of
the
people
whom
she
was
to
meet
again
next
season
in
the
london
world
she
had
made
an
informal
in
a
very
select
circle
a
circle
in
which
everybody
was
more
or
less
or
or
and
she
was
tasting
all
the
sweets
of
success
but
in
none
of
her
letters
was
there
any
mention
of
lord
hartfield
he
was
not
in
the
little
great
world
by
the
blue
tideless
sea
there
was
no
talk
of
lesbia
return
she
was
to
stay
till
the
carnival
she
was
to
stay
till
the
week
before
easter
lady
kirkbank
insisted
upon
it
and
both
lesbia
and
lady
kirkbank
upbraided
lady
maulevrier
for
her
cruelty
in
not
joining
them
at
cannes
so
lady
maulevrier
had
to
resign
herself
to
that
solitude
which
had
become
almost
the
habit
of
her
life
and
to
the
society
of
mary
and
the
fräulein
mary
was
eager
to
be
of
use
to
sit
with
her
grandmother
to
read
to
her
to
write
for
her
the
warm
young
heart
was
deeply
moved
by
the
spectacle
of
this
stately
woman
stricken
into
helplessness
chained
to
her
couch
immured
within
four
walls
to
mary
who
so
loved
the
hills
and
the
streams
the
sun
and
the
wind
this
imprisonment
seemed
unspeakable
woe
in
her
pity
for
such
a
martyrdom
she
would
have
done
anything
to
give
pleasure
or
solace
to
her
grandmother
unhappily
there
was
very
little
mary
could
do
to
increase
the
invalid
sum
of
pleasure
lady
maulevrier
was
a
woman
of
strong
feeling
not
capable
of
loving
many
people
she
had
concentrated
her
affection
upon
lesbia
and
she
could
not
open
her
heart
to
mary
all
at
once
because
lesbia
was
out
of
the
way
i
had
a
dog
i
loved
and
he
were
to
die
i
would
never
have
another
in
his
place
lady
maulevrier
said
once
and
that
speech
was
the
keynote
of
her
character
she
was
very
courteous
to
mary
and
seemed
grateful
for
her
attentions
but
she
did
not
cultivate
the
girl
society
mary
wrote
all
her
letters
in
a
fine
bold
hand
and
with
a
rapid
pen
but
when
the
was
over
lady
maulevrier
always
dismissed
her
dear
you
want
to
be
out
in
the
air
riding
your
pony
or
scampering
about
with
your
dogs
she
said
kindly
would
be
a
cruelty
to
keep
you
indoors
indeed
dear
grandmother
i
should
like
to
stay
may
i
stop
and
read
to
you
thank
you
mary
i
hate
being
read
to
i
like
to
devour
a
book
reading
aloud
is
such
slow
work
i
am
afraid
you
must
sometimes
feel
lonely
faltered
mary
echoed
the
dowager
with
a
sigh
have
been
lonely
for
the
last
forty
years
i
have
been
lonely
all
my
life
those
i
loved
never
gave
me
back
love
for
love
never
not
even
your
sister
see
how
lightly
she
cuts
the
link
that
bound
her
to
me
how
happy
she
is
among
strangers
yes
there
was
one
who
loved
me
truly
and
fate
parted
us
does
fate
part
all
true
lovers
i
wonder
parted
lesbia
and
hammond
said
mary
impetuously
am
sure
they
loved
each
other
truly
old
and
the
are
fate
mary
answered
the
dowager
not
angry
at
this
daring
reproach
know
your
sister
and
i
know
she
is
not
the
kind
of
woman
to
be
happy
in
an
ignoble
life
to
bear
poverty
and
deprivation
if
it
had
been
you
now
whom
hammond
had
chosen
i
might
have
taken
the
subject
into
my
consideration
mary
flamed
crimson
hammond
never
gave
me
a
thought
she
said
it
was
to
think
me
contemptible
he
is
worlds
too
good
for
such
a
tomboy
maulevrier
told
him
about
the
and
they
both
laughed
at
me
at
least
i
have
no
doubt
hammond
laughed
though
i
was
too
much
ashamed
to
look
at
him
mary
you
are
beginning
to
find
out
that
a
young
lady
ought
to
be
ladylike
said
lady
maulevrier
now
my
dear
you
may
go
i
was
only
joking
with
you
hammond
would
be
no
match
for
any
granddaughter
of
mine
he
is
nobody
and
has
neither
friends
nor
interest
if
he
had
gone
into
the
church
maulevrier
could
have
helped
him
but
i
daresay
his
ideas
are
too
broad
for
the
church
and
he
will
have
to
starve
at
the
bar
where
nobody
can
help
him
i
hope
you
will
bear
this
in
mind
mary
if
maulevrier
should
ever
bring
him
here
again
is
never
likely
to
come
back
again
he
suffered
too
much
he
was
treated
too
badly
in
this
house
mary
be
good
enough
to
remember
to
whom
you
are
speaking
said
her
ladyship
with
a
frown
now
please
go
and
tell
some
one
to
send
steadman
to
me
mary
retired
without
a
word
gave
lady
maulevrier
message
to
a
footman
in
the
corridor
slipped
off
to
her
room
put
on
her
sealskin
hat
and
jacket
took
her
staff
and
went
out
for
a
long
ramble
the
hills
and
valleys
were
still
white
it
had
been
a
long
cold
winter
and
spring
was
still
far
off
february
had
only
just
begun
lady
maulevrier
couch
had
been
wheeled
into
the
that
luxurious
room
which
was
furnished
with
all
things
needful
to
her
quiet
life
her
books
her
favourite
colours
her
favourite
flowers
every
detail
studiously
arranged
for
her
pleasure
and
comfort
she
was
wheeled
into
this
room
every
day
at
noon
when
the
day
was
bright
and
sunny
her
couch
was
placed
near
the
window
and
when
the
day
was
dull
and
grey
the
couch
was
drawn
close
to
the
low
hearth
which
flashed
and
glittered
with
brightly
coloured
tiles
and
artistic
brass
the
sky
was
dull
and
the
velvet
couch
stood
beside
the
hearth
halcott
sat
at
work
in
the
adjoining
and
came
in
every
now
and
then
to
replenish
the
fire
a
footman
was
always
on
duty
in
the
corridor
a
spring
bell
stood
among
the
elegant
trifles
upon
her
ladyship
table
and
the
lightest
touch
of
her
left
hand
upon
the
bell
brought
her
attendants
to
her
side
she
resolutely
refused
to
have
any
one
sitting
with
her
all
day
long
solitude
was
a
necessity
of
her
being
she
told
horton
when
he
recommended
that
she
should
have
some
one
always
in
attendance
upon
her
as
the
weeks
wore
on
her
features
had
been
restored
to
their
proud
calm
beauty
her
articulation
was
almost
as
clear
as
of
old
yet
now
and
then
there
would
be
a
sudden
faltering
the
tongue
and
lips
would
refuse
their
office
or
she
would
forget
a
word
or
use
a
wrong
word
unconsciously
but
there
was
no
recovery
of
power
or
movement
on
that
side
of
the
body
which
had
been
stricken
the
paralysed
limbs
were
still
motionless
lifeless
as
marble
and
it
was
clear
that
horton
had
begun
to
lose
heart
about
his
patient
there
was
nothing
obscure
in
the
case
but
the
patient
importance
made
the
treatment
a
serious
matter
and
the
surgeon
begged
to
be
allowed
to
summon
sir
william
jenner
this
however
lady
maulevrier
refused
do
want
any
fuss
made
about
me
she
said
am
content
to
trust
myself
to
your
skill
and
i
beg
that
no
other
doctor
may
be
summoned
horton
understood
his
patient
feelings
on
this
point
she
had
a
sense
of
humiliation
in
her
helplessness
and
like
some
wounded
animal
that
crawls
to
its
covert
to
die
she
would
fain
have
hidden
her
misery
from
the
eye
of
strangers
she
had
allowed
no
one
not
even
maulevrier
to
be
informed
of
the
nature
of
her
illness
will
be
time
enough
for
him
to
know
all
about
me
when
he
comes
here
she
said
shall
be
obliged
to
see
him
whenever
he
does
come
maulevrier
had
spent
christmas
and
new
year
in
paris
hammond
still
his
companion
her
ladyship
commented
upon
this
with
a
touch
of
scorn
hammond
is
like
the
umbra
you
were
reading
about
the
other
day
in
lord
lytton
last
days
of
pompeii
she
said
to
mary
must
be
very
nice
for
him
to
go
about
the
world
with
a
friend
who
franks
him
everywhere
we
do
know
that
maulevrier
franks
him
protested
mary
blushing
have
no
right
to
suppose
that
hammond
does
not
pay
his
own
expenses
dear
child
is
it
possible
for
a
young
man
who
has
no
private
means
to
go
gadding
about
the
world
on
equal
terms
with
a
spendthrift
like
maulevrier
to
pay
for
moors
in
scotland
and
apartments
at
the
bristol
they
are
not
staying
at
the
bristol
exclaimed
mary
are
staying
at
an
french
hotel
on
the
left
side
of
the
seine
they
are
going
about
amongst
the
students
and
the
workmen
dining
at
popular
restaurants
hearing
people
talk
maulevrier
says
it
is
delightfully
amusing
ever
so
much
better
than
the
beaten
track
of
life
in
paris
daresay
they
are
leading
a
bohemian
life
and
will
get
into
trouble
before
they
have
done
said
her
ladyship
gloomily
is
as
wild
as
a
hawk
is
the
dearest
boy
in
the
world
exclaimed
mary
she
was
deeply
grateful
for
her
brother
condescension
in
writing
her
a
letter
of
two
pages
long
letting
her
into
the
secrets
of
his
life
she
felt
as
if
hammond
were
ever
so
much
nearer
to
her
now
she
knew
where
he
was
and
how
he
was
amusing
himself
is
such
a
queer
fellow
wrote
maulevrier
strangest
things
interest
him
he
sits
and
talks
to
the
workmen
for
hours
he
pokes
his
nose
into
all
sorts
of
places
hospitals
workshops
dens
and
people
are
always
civil
to
him
he
is
what
lesbia
calls
ah
what
a
mistake
lesbia
and
my
grandmother
made
when
they
rejected
hammond
what
a
pearl
above
price
they
threw
away
but
you
see
neither
my
lady
nor
lesbia
could
appreciate
a
gem
unless
it
was
richly
set
and
now
lady
maulevrier
lay
on
her
couch
by
the
fire
waiting
for
james
steadman
she
had
seen
him
several
times
since
the
day
of
her
seizure
but
never
alone
there
was
an
idea
that
steadman
must
necessarily
talk
to
her
of
business
matters
or
cause
her
mind
to
trouble
itself
about
business
matters
so
there
had
been
a
conspiracy
in
the
house
to
keep
him
out
of
her
way
but
now
she
was
much
better
and
her
desire
to
see
steadman
need
no
longer
be
thwarted
he
came
at
her
bidding
and
stood
a
little
way
within
the
door
tall
erect
with
a
quiet
force
of
character
expressed
in
every
feature
he
was
very
much
the
same
man
that
he
had
been
forty
years
ago
when
he
went
with
her
ladyship
to
southampton
and
accompanied
his
master
and
mistress
on
that
tedious
journey
which
was
destined
to
be
lord
maulevrier
last
earthly
pilgrimage
time
had
done
little
to
steadman
in
those
forty
years
except
to
whiten
his
hair
and
beard
and
imprint
some
thoughtful
lines
upon
his
sagacious
forehead
time
had
done
something
for
him
mentally
insomuch
as
he
had
read
a
great
many
books
and
cultivated
his
mind
in
the
monotonous
quiet
of
fellside
altogether
he
was
a
superior
man
for
the
passage
of
those
forty
years
he
had
married
within
the
time
choosing
for
himself
the
buxom
daughter
of
a
lodgekeeper
whose
wife
had
long
been
laid
at
rest
in
grasmere
churchyard
the
buxom
girl
had
grown
into
a
bulky
matron
but
she
was
a
colourless
personage
and
her
existence
made
hardly
any
difference
in
james
steadman
life
she
had
brought
him
no
children
and
their
fireside
was
lonely
but
steadman
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
personages
to
whom
a
solitary
life
is
no
affliction
hope
i
see
you
in
better
health
my
lady
he
said
standing
straight
and
square
like
a
soldier
on
parade
am
better
thank
you
steadman
better
but
a
poor
lifeless
log
chained
to
this
sofa
i
sent
for
you
because
the
time
has
come
when
i
must
talk
to
you
upon
a
matter
of
business
you
heard
i
suppose
that
a
stranger
called
upon
me
just
before
i
had
my
attack
my
lady
you
hear
who
and
what
he
was
that
he
was
a
foreigner
my
lady
is
of
indian
birth
he
claims
to
be
the
son
of
the
ranee
of
bisnagar
could
do
you
no
harm
my
lady
if
he
were
twenty
times
her
son
hope
not
now
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
among
those
trunks
and
cases
and
packages
of
lord
maulevrier
which
were
sent
here
by
heavy
coach
after
they
were
landed
at
southampton
do
you
remember
two
cases
of
books
are
two
large
cases
among
the
luggage
my
lady
very
heavy
cases
iron
clamped
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
they
were
full
of
books
they
never
been
opened
to
my
knowledge
they
locked
my
lady
there
are
two
padlocks
on
each
chest
are
the
keys
in
your
possession
my
lady
are
the
cases
the
oak
room
with
the
rest
of
the
indian
luggage
them
remain
there
no
doubt
those
cases
contain
the
books
of
which
i
have
been
told
you
have
not
heard
that
the
person
calling
himself
rajah
of
bisnagar
has
been
here
since
my
illness
have
you
my
lady
i
am
sure
he
has
not
been
here
lady
maulevrier
gave
him
a
scrutinising
look
might
have
come
and
my
people
might
have
kept
the
knowledge
from
me
out
of
consideration
for
my
infirmity
she
said
should
be
very
angry
if
it
were
so
i
should
hate
to
be
treated
like
a
child
shall
not
be
so
treated
my
lady
while
i
am
in
this
house
but
i
know
there
is
no
member
of
the
household
who
would
presume
so
to
treat
you
might
do
it
out
of
kindness
but
i
should
loathe
such
kindness
said
lady
maulevrier
impatiently
i
have
been
smitten
down
though
i
lie
here
like
a
log
i
have
a
mind
to
think
and
to
plan
and
i
am
not
afraid
to
meet
danger
face
to
face
are
you
telling
me
the
truth
steadman
have
there
been
no
visits
concealed
from
me
no
letters
kept
from
me
since
i
have
been
ill
am
telling
you
nothing
but
the
truth
my
lady
no
letter
has
been
kept
from
you
no
visitor
has
been
to
this
house
whose
coming
you
have
not
been
told
of
i
am
content
said
her
ladyship
with
a
sigh
of
relief
after
this
there
followed
some
conversation
upon
business
matters
james
steadman
was
trusted
with
the
entire
management
of
the
dowager
income
the
investment
of
her
savings
his
honesty
was
above
all
suspicion
he
was
a
man
of
simple
habits
his
wants
few
he
had
saved
money
in
every
year
of
his
service
and
for
a
man
of
his
station
was
rich
enough
to
be
unassailable
by
the
tempter
he
had
reconciled
his
mind
to
the
monotonous
course
of
life
at
fellside
in
the
beginning
of
things
and
as
the
years
glided
smoothly
by
his
character
and
wants
and
inclinations
had
as
it
were
moulded
themselves
to
fit
that
life
he
had
easy
duties
a
comfortable
home
supreme
authority
in
the
household
he
was
looked
up
to
and
made
much
of
in
the
village
whenever
he
condescended
to
appear
there
and
by
the
rareness
of
his
visits
to
the
inn
or
the
and
his
unwillingness
to
accept
hospitality
from
the
tradesmen
of
grasmere
and
ambleside
he
maintained
his
dignity
and
exaggerated
his
importance
he
had
his
books
and
his
newspapers
his
evening
leisure
which
no
one
ever
dared
to
disturb
he
had
the
old
wing
of
the
house
for
his
exclusive
occupation
and
no
one
ventured
to
intrude
upon
him
in
his
privacy
there
was
a
bell
in
the
corridor
which
communicated
with
his
rooms
and
by
this
bell
he
was
always
summoned
there
were
servants
who
had
been
ten
years
at
fellside
and
who
had
never
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
red
cloth
door
which
was
the
only
communication
between
the
new
house
and
the
old
one
steadman
wife
performed
all
household
duties
of
cooking
and
cleaning
in
the
south
wing
where
she
and
her
husband
took
all
their
meals
and
lived
entirely
apart
from
the
other
servants
an
exclusiveness
which
was
secretly
resented
by
the
establishment
steadman
may
be
a
very
superior
man
said
the
butler
i
know
that
in
his
own
estimation
the
premier
is
in
it
compared
with
him
but
i
never
was
fond
of
people
who
set
themselves
upon
pinnacles
and
i
not
fond
of
the
steadmans
steadman
plain
and
homely
enough
replied
the
housekeeper
i
know
she
like
to
be
more
sociable
and
drop
into
my
room
for
a
cup
of
tea
now
and
then
but
steadman
do
so
keep
her
under
his
thumb
and
because
he
a
misanthrope
she
obliged
to
sit
and
mope
alone
if
steadman
wanted
to
drive
there
was
a
dogcart
and
horse
at
his
disposal
but
he
did
not
often
leave
fellside
he
seemed
in
his
humble
way
to
model
his
life
upon
lady
maulevrier
secluded
habits
it
was
growing
dusk
when
steadman
left
his
mistress
and
she
lay
for
some
time
looking
at
the
landscape
over
which
twilight
shadows
were
stealing
and
thinking
of
her
own
life
over
that
life
too
the
shadows
of
evening
were
creeping
she
had
begun
to
realise
the
fact
that
she
was
an
old
woman
that
for
her
all
personal
interest
in
life
was
nearly
over
she
had
never
felt
her
age
while
her
activity
was
unimpaired
she
had
been
obliged
to
remind
herself
very
often
that
the
afternoon
and
evening
of
life
had
slipped
away
unawares
in
that
tranquil
retirement
and
that
the
night
was
at
hand
for
her
the
close
of
earthly
life
meant
actual
night
no
new
dawn
no
mysterious
shone
upon
her
with
magical
gleams
of
an
unknown
light
upon
the
other
side
of
the
dark
river
she
had
accepted
the
materialist
bitter
and
barren
creed
and
had
taught
herself
that
this
little
life
was
all
she
had
learned
to
scorn
the
idea
of
a
great
artificer
outside
the
universe
a
mighty
spirit
riding
amidst
the
clouds
and
ruling
the
course
of
nature
and
the
fate
of
man
she
had
schooled
herself
to
think
that
the
idea
of
a
blind
unconscious
nature
working
automatically
through
infinite
time
and
space
was
ever
so
much
grander
than
the
notion
of
a
personal
god
a
being
of
infinite
power
and
inexhaustible
beneficence
mighty
to
devise
and
direct
the
universe
with
knowledge
reaching
to
the
farthest
confines
of
space
with
ear
to
listen
to
the
prayer
of
his
lowest
creatures
her
belief
stopped
short
even
of
the
deist
faith
in
an
almighty
will
she
saw
in
creation
nothing
but
the
inevitable
development
of
material
laws
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
quite
as
much
hope
of
a
heavenly
world
after
death
for
the
infusoria
in
the
pool
as
for
man
in
his
pride
and
power
she
read
her
bible
as
diligently
as
she
read
her
shakespeare
and
the
words
of
the
royal
preacher
in
some
measure
embodied
her
own
dreary
creed
and
now
in
the
darkening
winter
day
she
watched
the
gloomy
shadows
creep
over
the
rugged
breast
of
nabb
scar
and
she
thought
how
there
was
a
time
for
all
things
and
that
her
day
of
hope
and
ambition
was
past
of
late
years
she
had
lived
for
lesbia
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
she
was
to
introduce
this
beloved
grandchild
to
the
great
world
of
london
and
now
that
hope
was
gone
for
ever
what
could
a
helpless
cripple
do
for
a
fashionable
beauty
what
good
would
it
be
for
her
to
be
conveyed
to
london
and
to
lie
on
a
couch
in
mayfair
while
lesbia
rode
in
the
row
and
went
to
three
or
four
parties
every
night
with
a
more
active
chaperon
she
had
hoped
to
go
everywhere
with
her
darling
to
glory
in
all
her
successes
to
shield
her
from
all
possibility
of
failure
and
now
lesbia
must
stand
or
fall
alone
it
was
a
hard
thing
but
perhaps
the
hardest
part
of
it
was
that
lesbia
seemed
so
very
well
able
to
get
on
without
her
the
girl
wrote
in
the
highest
spirits
and
although
her
letters
were
most
affectionately
worded
they
were
all
about
self
that
note
was
dominant
in
every
strain
her
triumphs
her
admirers
her
bonnets
her
gowns
she
had
had
more
money
from
her
grandmother
and
more
gowns
from
paris
have
no
idea
how
the
people
dress
in
this
place
she
wrote
should
have
been
quite
out
in
the
cold
without
my
three
new
frocks
from
worth
the
little
princess
bonnets
i
wear
are
the
rage
worth
recommended
me
to
adopt
special
flowers
and
colours
so
i
have
worn
nothing
but
primroses
since
i
have
been
here
and
my
little
primrose
bonnets
are
to
be
seen
everywhere
sometimes
on
hideous
old
women
lady
kirkbank
hopes
you
will
be
able
to
go
to
london
directly
after
easter
she
says
i
must
be
presented
at
the
may
that
is
imperative
people
have
begun
to
talk
about
me
and
unless
i
make
my
while
their
interest
is
fresh
i
shall
be
a
failure
there
is
an
american
beauty
here
and
i
believe
she
and
i
are
considered
rivals
and
young
men
lay
wagers
about
us
as
to
which
will
look
best
at
a
ball
or
a
regatta
what
colours
we
shall
wear
and
so
on
it
is
immense
fun
i
only
wish
you
were
here
to
enjoy
it
the
american
girl
is
a
most
insolent
person
but
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
crushing
her
on
several
occasions
in
the
calmest
way
in
the
description
of
the
concert
in
last
week
newspaper
i
was
called
de
i
certainly
had
the
decency
to
hold
my
tongue
while
faure
was
singing
miss
bolsover
voice
was
heard
ever
so
many
times
above
the
music
according
to
our
english
ideas
she
has
most
revolting
manners
and
the
money
she
spends
on
her
clothes
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
now
do
dearest
grandmother
make
all
your
arrangements
for
beginning
the
campaign
directly
after
easter
you
must
take
a
house
in
the
very
choicest
quarter
lady
kirkbank
suggests
and
it
be
a
large
house
for
of
course
you
will
give
a
ball
lady
says
we
might
have
lord
porlock
house
poor
lady
porlock
and
her
baby
died
a
few
weeks
ago
and
he
has
gone
to
sweden
quite
it
is
one
of
the
new
houses
exquisitely
furnished
and
lady
thinks
you
might
have
it
for
a
song
will
you
get
steadman
to
write
to
his
lordship
steward
and
see
what
can
be
done
hope
the
dear
hand
is
better
you
have
never
told
me
how
you
hurt
it
it
is
very
sweet
of
mary
to
write
me
such
long
letters
and
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
to
find
she
can
spell
but
i
want
to
see
your
own
dear
hand
once
more
chapter
xviii
come
agen
be
it
by
night
or
day
those
winter
months
were
unutterably
dreary
for
lady
mary
haselden
she
felt
weighed
down
by
a
sense
of
death
and
woe
near
at
hand
the
horror
of
that
dreadful
moment
in
which
she
found
her
grandmother
lying
senseless
on
the
ground
the
terror
of
that
distorted
countenance
those
starting
eyes
that
stertorous
breathing
was
not
easily
banished
from
a
vivid
girlish
imagination
seeing
how
few
distractions
there
were
to
divert
mary
thoughts
and
how
the
sun
sank
and
rose
again
upon
the
same
inevitable
surroundings
to
the
same
monotonous
routine
her
grandmother
was
kinder
than
she
had
been
in
days
gone
by
less
inclined
to
find
fault
but
mary
knew
that
her
society
gave
lady
maulevrier
very
little
pleasure
that
she
could
do
hardly
anything
towards
filling
the
gap
made
by
lesbia
absence
there
was
no
one
to
scold
her
no
one
to
quarrel
with
her
fräulein
müller
lectured
her
mildly
from
time
to
time
but
that
stout
german
was
too
lazy
to
put
any
force
or
fire
into
her
lectures
her
reproofs
were
like
the
fall
of
waterdrops
on
a
stone
and
infinite
ages
would
have
been
needed
to
cause
any
positive
impression
february
came
to
an
end
without
sign
or
token
from
the
outer
world
to
disturb
the
even
tenor
of
life
at
fellside
mary
read
and
read
and
read
till
she
felt
she
was
made
up
of
the
contents
of
books
crammed
with
other
people
ideas
she
read
history
or
natural
science
or
travels
or
german
poetry
in
the
morning
and
novels
or
english
poetry
in
the
evening
she
had
pledged
herself
to
devote
her
morning
indoor
hours
to
instructive
literature
and
to
accomplish
some
portion
of
study
in
every
day
she
was
carrying
on
her
education
on
parole
as
before
stated
and
she
was
too
honourable
to
do
less
than
was
expected
from
her
march
came
in
with
its
most
leonine
aspect
howling
and
blustering
winds
shrieking
along
the
gorges
and
wailing
from
height
to
height
wonder
the
lion
and
the
lamb
are
not
blown
into
the
lake
said
mary
looking
at
helm
crag
from
the
library
window
she
scampered
about
the
gardens
in
the
very
teeth
of
those
bitter
blasts
and
took
her
shivering
terriers
for
runs
on
the
green
slopes
of
the
fell
the
snow
had
gradually
melted
from
the
tides
of
the
lowermost
range
of
hills
but
the
mountain
peaks
were
still
white
and
ghostly
the
ground
was
still
hard
and
slippery
in
the
early
mornings
mary
had
to
take
her
walks
alone
in
this
bleak
weather
fräulein
had
a
convenient
bronchial
affection
which
forbade
her
to
venture
so
much
as
the
point
of
her
nose
outside
the
house
in
an
east
wind
and
which
justified
her
in
occasionally
taking
her
breakfast
in
bed
she
spent
her
days
for
the
most
part
in
her
drawn
close
to
the
fireplace
which
she
still
insisted
upon
calling
the
oven
knitting
diligently
or
reading
the
even
music
which
had
once
been
her
strong
point
was
neglected
in
this
trying
weather
it
was
such
a
cold
journey
from
the
oven
to
the
piano
mary
played
a
good
deal
in
her
desultory
manner
now
that
she
had
the
all
to
herself
and
no
fear
of
lady
maulevrier
critical
ear
or
lesbia
superior
smile
the
fräulein
was
pleased
to
hear
her
pupil
ramble
on
with
her
favourite
bits
from
raff
and
hensel
and
schubert
and
mendelssohn
and
mozart
and
was
very
well
content
to
let
her
play
just
what
she
liked
and
to
escape
the
trouble
of
training
her
to
that
exquisite
perfection
into
which
lady
lesbia
had
been
drilled
lesbia
was
not
a
genius
and
the
training
process
had
been
quite
as
hard
for
the
governess
as
for
the
pupil
thus
the
slow
days
wore
on
till
the
first
week
in
march
and
on
one
bleak
bitter
afternoon
when
fräulein
müller
stuck
to
the
oven
even
a
little
closer
than
usual
mary
felt
she
must
go
out
in
the
face
of
the
east
wind
which
was
tossing
the
leafless
branches
in
the
valley
below
until
the
trees
looked
like
an
angry
crowd
hurling
its
arms
in
the
air
fighting
struggling
writhing
she
must
leave
that
dreary
house
for
a
little
while
were
it
even
to
be
lashed
and
bruised
and
broken
by
that
fierce
wind
so
she
told
fräulein
that
she
really
must
have
her
constitutional
and
after
a
feeble
remonstrance
fräulein
let
her
go
and
subsided
luxuriously
into
the
pillowed
depth
of
her
there
had
been
a
hard
frost
and
all
the
mountain
ways
were
perilous
so
mary
set
out
upon
a
steady
tramp
along
the
road
leading
towards
the
langdales
the
wind
seemed
to
assail
her
from
every
side
but
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
defy
the
elements
and
she
only
hugged
her
sealskin
jacket
closer
to
her
and
quickened
her
pace
chirruping
and
whistling
to
ahab
and
ariadne
the
two
which
she
had
selected
for
the
privilege
of
a
walk
the
terriers
raced
along
the
road
and
mary
seeing
that
she
had
the
road
all
to
herself
raced
after
them
a
light
large
feathery
flakes
flying
wide
apart
fell
from
the
sky
but
mary
minded
the
snow
no
more
than
she
minded
the
wind
she
raced
on
the
terriers
scampering
rushing
flying
before
her
until
just
where
the
road
took
a
curve
she
almost
ran
into
a
horse
which
was
stepping
along
at
a
tremendous
pace
with
a
light
high
dogcart
behind
him
cried
the
driver
are
you
coming
young
woman
have
you
never
seen
a
horse
till
some
one
beside
the
driver
leapt
out
and
ran
to
see
if
mary
was
hurt
the
horse
had
swerved
to
one
side
reared
a
little
and
then
spun
on
for
a
few
yards
leaving
her
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
it
molly
cried
the
driver
who
was
no
less
distinguished
a
whip
than
lord
maulevrier
and
who
had
recognised
the
terriers
hope
you
are
not
hurt
said
the
gentleman
who
had
alighted
maulevrier
friend
and
shadow
john
hammond
mary
was
covered
with
confusion
by
her
exploit
and
could
hardly
answer
hammond
very
simple
question
she
looked
up
at
him
piteously
trying
to
speak
and
he
took
alarm
at
her
scared
expression
am
sure
you
are
hurt
he
said
earnestly
horse
must
have
struck
you
or
the
shaft
perhaps
which
was
worse
is
it
your
shoulder
that
is
hurt
or
your
chest
lean
on
me
if
you
feel
faint
or
giddy
maulevrier
you
had
better
drive
your
sister
home
and
get
her
looked
after
i
am
not
hurt
not
the
least
little
bit
gasped
mary
who
had
recovered
her
senses
by
this
time
was
only
frightened
and
it
was
such
a
surprise
to
see
you
and
maulevrier
a
surprise
yes
a
surprise
which
had
set
her
heart
throbbing
so
violently
as
to
render
her
speechless
had
horse
or
struck
her
ever
so
she
would
have
hardly
been
more
tremulous
than
she
felt
at
this
moment
never
had
she
hoped
to
see
him
again
he
had
set
his
all
upon
one
cast
loved
wooed
and
lost
her
sister
why
should
he
ever
come
again
what
was
there
at
fellside
worth
coming
for
and
then
she
remembered
what
her
grandmother
thought
of
him
he
was
a
a
sponge
a
led
captain
he
was
maulevrier
umbra
and
must
go
where
his
patron
went
it
was
a
hard
thing
so
to
think
of
him
and
mary
heart
sank
at
the
thought
that
lady
maulevrier
worldly
wisdom
might
have
reckoned
aright
was
very
foolish
of
me
to
run
into
the
horse
said
mary
while
hammond
stood
waiting
for
her
to
recover
herself
was
very
foolish
of
maulevrier
to
run
into
you
if
he
did
drive
at
such
a
pace
it
would
have
happened
umbra
was
very
at
any
rate
rank
ingratitude
cried
maulevrier
who
had
turned
back
and
was
looking
down
at
them
from
his
elevated
perch
my
coming
all
the
way
round
by
langdale
to
oblige
you
with
a
view
of
elterwater
molly
all
safe
and
sound
she
would
have
minded
if
i
run
over
her
come
along
child
get
up
beside
me
hammond
will
take
the
back
seat
this
was
easier
said
than
done
for
the
back
of
the
dogcart
was
piled
with
gladstone
bags
fishing
rods
and
but
umbra
was
ready
to
oblige
he
handed
mary
up
to
the
seat
by
the
driver
and
clambered
up
at
the
back
when
he
hooked
himself
on
somehow
among
the
luggage
maulevrier
how
delicious
of
you
to
come
said
mary
when
they
were
rattling
on
towards
fellside
hope
you
are
going
to
stay
for
ages
i
dare
say
if
you
make
yourself
very
agreeable
i
may
stay
till
after
easter
mary
countenance
fell
is
in
three
weeks
she
said
despondingly
is
three
weeks
an
age
at
such
a
place
as
fellside
i
do
know
that
i
should
have
come
at
all
on
this
side
of
the
august
sports
only
as
the
grandmother
was
ill
i
thought
it
a
duty
to
come
and
see
her
a
fellow
may
care
much
for
ancestors
when
they
well
you
know
but
when
a
poor
old
lady
is
down
on
her
luck
her
people
ought
to
look
after
her
so
here
i
am
and
as
i
knew
i
should
be
moped
to
death
here
you
for
the
compliment
said
mary
brought
hammond
along
with
me
of
course
i
knew
lesbia
was
safe
out
of
the
way
added
maulevrier
in
an
undertone
is
very
obliging
of
hammond
always
to
go
where
you
wish
returned
mary
who
could
not
help
a
bitter
feeling
when
she
remembered
her
grandmother
cruel
suggestion
he
no
tastes
or
inclinations
of
his
own
he
has
plenty
of
them
and
much
loftier
tastes
than
mine
i
can
tell
you
but
he
kind
enough
to
let
me
hang
on
to
him
and
to
put
up
with
my
frivolity
there
never
were
two
men
more
different
than
he
and
i
are
and
i
suppose
that
why
we
get
on
so
well
together
when
we
were
in
paris
he
was
always
up
to
his
eyes
in
serious
work
lectures
public
libraries
workmen
syndicates
mary
anne
the
international
heaven
knows
what
making
himself
master
of
the
political
situation
in
france
while
i
was
and
at
the
bal
bullier
it
was
generous
of
maulevrier
to
speak
of
his
thus
and
no
doubt
the
society
of
a
earnest
young
man
was
a
great
good
for
maulevrier
a
good
far
above
the
price
of
those
pounds
shillings
and
pence
which
the
earl
might
spend
for
his
dependent
benefit
but
when
a
girl
of
mary
ardent
temper
has
made
a
hero
of
a
man
it
galls
her
to
think
that
her
hero
dignity
should
be
sacrificed
his
honour
impeached
were
it
by
the
merest
tittle
maulevrier
made
a
good
many
inquiries
about
his
grandmother
and
seemed
really
full
of
kindness
and
sympathy
but
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
profound
awe
nay
of
involuntary
reluctance
and
shrinking
that
he
presently
entered
her
ladyship
ushered
in
by
mary
who
had
been
to
her
grandmother
beforehand
to
announce
the
arrival
the
young
man
had
hardly
ever
been
in
a
sick
room
before
he
half
expected
to
see
lady
maulevrier
in
bed
with
a
crowd
of
medicine
bottles
and
a
cut
orange
on
a
table
by
her
side
and
a
sick
nurse
of
the
species
cowering
over
the
fire
it
was
an
infinite
relief
to
him
to
find
his
grandmother
lying
on
a
sofa
by
the
fire
in
her
pretty
morning
room
a
little
was
drawn
close
up
to
her
sofa
and
she
was
taking
her
afternoon
tea
it
was
rather
painful
to
see
her
lifting
her
slowly
and
carefully
with
her
left
hand
but
that
was
all
the
dark
eyes
still
flashed
with
the
old
eagle
glance
the
lines
of
the
lips
were
as
proud
and
firm
as
ever
all
sign
of
contraction
or
distortion
had
passed
away
in
hours
of
calm
her
ladyship
beauty
was
unimpaired
but
with
any
strong
emotion
there
came
a
convulsive
working
of
the
features
and
the
face
was
momentarily
drawn
and
distorted
as
it
had
been
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
maulevrier
presence
had
not
an
unduly
agitating
effect
on
her
ladyship
she
received
him
with
tranquil
graciousness
and
thanked
him
for
his
coming
hope
you
have
spent
your
winter
profitably
in
paris
she
said
is
a
great
deal
to
be
learnt
there
if
you
go
into
the
right
circles
maulevrier
told
her
that
he
had
found
much
to
learn
and
that
he
had
gone
into
circles
where
almost
everything
was
new
to
him
whereupon
his
grandmother
questioned
him
about
certain
noble
families
in
the
faubourg
saint
germain
who
had
been
known
to
her
in
her
own
day
of
power
and
whose
movements
she
had
observed
from
a
distance
since
that
time
but
here
she
found
her
grandson
dark
he
had
not
happened
to
meet
any
of
the
people
she
spoke
about
the
plain
truth
being
that
he
had
lived
altogether
as
a
bohemian
and
had
not
used
one
of
the
letters
of
introduction
that
had
been
given
to
him
friend
hammond
is
with
you
i
am
told
said
lady
maulevrier
not
altogether
with
delight
i
made
him
come
but
he
is
quite
safe
he
will
bolt
like
a
shot
at
the
least
hint
of
lesbia
return
he
does
want
to
meet
that
young
lady
again
i
can
assure
you
do
talk
in
that
injured
tone
hammond
is
a
gentlemanlike
person
very
well
informed
very
agreeable
i
have
never
denied
that
but
you
could
not
expect
me
to
allow
my
granddaughter
to
throw
herself
away
upon
the
first
adventurer
who
made
her
an
offer
is
not
an
adventurer
well
i
will
not
call
him
so
if
the
term
offends
you
but
hammond
is
hammond
and
i
can
not
allow
lesbia
to
marry
hammond
or
mr
anybody
and
i
am
very
sorry
you
have
brought
him
here
again
there
is
mary
a
silly
romantic
girl
i
am
very
much
afraid
he
has
made
an
impression
upon
her
she
colours
absurdly
when
she
talks
of
him
and
flew
into
a
passion
with
me
the
other
day
when
i
ventured
to
hint
that
he
is
not
a
rothschild
and
that
his
society
must
be
expensive
to
you
society
does
not
cost
me
anything
hammond
is
the
soul
of
independence
he
worked
as
a
blacksmith
in
canada
for
three
months
just
to
see
what
life
was
like
in
a
wild
district
there
never
was
such
a
fellow
to
rough
it
and
as
for
molly
well
now
really
if
he
happened
to
take
a
fancy
to
her
and
if
she
happened
to
like
him
i
would
bosh
the
business
if
i
were
you
grandmother
take
my
word
for
it
molly
might
do
worse
course
she
might
marry
a
chimney
sweep
there
is
no
answering
for
a
girl
of
her
erratic
nature
she
is
silly
enough
and
romantic
enough
for
anything
but
i
shall
not
countenance
her
if
she
wants
to
throw
herself
away
on
a
person
without
prospects
or
connections
and
i
look
to
you
maulevrier
to
take
care
of
her
now
that
i
am
a
wretched
log
chained
to
this
room
may
rely
upon
me
grandmother
molly
shall
come
to
no
harm
if
i
can
help
it
you
said
her
ladyship
touching
her
bell
twice
the
two
clear
silvery
strokes
were
a
summons
for
halcott
the
maid
who
appeared
immediately
power
to
get
his
lordship
room
ready
immediately
and
to
give
hammond
the
room
he
had
last
summer
said
lady
maulevrier
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
while
maulevrier
was
with
his
grandmother
john
hammond
was
smoking
a
solitary
cigar
on
the
terrace
contemplating
the
mountain
landscape
in
its
cold
march
greyness
and
wondering
very
much
to
find
himself
again
at
fellside
he
had
gone
forth
from
that
house
full
of
passionate
indignation
shaking
off
the
dust
from
his
feet
sternly
resolved
never
again
to
cross
the
threshold
of
that
fateful
cave
where
he
had
met
his
circe
and
now
because
circe
was
safe
out
of
the
way
he
had
come
back
to
the
cavern
and
he
was
feeling
all
the
pain
that
a
man
feels
who
beholds
again
the
scene
of
a
great
past
sorrow
was
this
the
old
love
and
the
old
pain
again
he
wondered
or
was
it
only
the
sharp
thrust
of
a
bitter
memory
he
had
believed
himself
cured
of
his
useless
love
a
great
and
noble
love
wasted
on
a
smaller
nature
than
his
own
he
had
thought
that
because
his
eyes
were
opened
and
he
understood
the
character
of
the
girl
he
loved
his
cure
must
needs
be
complete
yet
now
face
to
face
with
the
landscape
looking
down
upon
that
dull
grey
lake
which
he
had
seen
smiling
in
the
sunshine
he
began
to
doubt
the
completeness
of
his
cure
he
recalled
the
lovely
face
the
graceful
form
the
sweet
low
voice
the
perfection
of
gracious
womanhood
manner
dress
movements
tones
smiles
all
faultless
and
in
the
absence
of
that
one
figure
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
come
back
to
a
tenantless
dismantled
house
where
there
was
nothing
that
made
life
worth
living
the
red
sun
went
down
a
fierce
and
lurid
face
that
seemed
to
scowl
through
the
grey
and
hammond
felt
that
it
was
time
to
arouse
himself
from
gloomy
meditation
and
go
in
and
dress
for
dinner
maulevrier
valet
was
to
arrive
by
the
coach
with
the
heavier
part
of
the
luggage
and
maulevrier
valet
did
that
very
small
portion
of
valeting
which
was
ever
required
by
hammond
a
man
who
has
worked
at
a
forge
in
the
backwoods
is
not
likely
to
be
finicking
in
his
ways
or
dependent
upon
servants
for
looking
after
his
raiment
despite
hammond
gloomy
memories
of
past
joys
and
disillusions
he
contrived
to
make
himself
very
agreeable
at
dinner
and
in
the
after
dinner
and
the
evening
was
altogether
gay
and
sprightly
maulevrier
was
in
high
spirits
full
of
his
parisian
experiences
and
talking
slang
as
glibly
as
a
student
of
the
quartier
latin
he
would
talk
nothing
but
french
protesting
that
he
had
almost
forgotten
his
native
tongue
and
his
french
was
the
language
of
larchey
dictionary
of
argot
in
which
nothing
is
called
by
its
right
name
mary
was
enchanted
with
this
new
vocabulary
and
wanted
to
have
every
word
explained
to
her
but
maulevrier
confessed
that
there
was
a
good
deal
that
was
unexplainable
the
evening
was
much
livelier
than
those
summer
evenings
when
the
dowager
and
lady
lesbia
were
present
there
was
something
less
of
refinement
perhaps
and
fräulein
remonstrated
now
and
then
about
some
small
violation
of
the
unwritten
laws
of
but
there
was
more
mirth
maulevrier
felt
for
the
first
time
as
if
he
were
master
at
fellside
they
all
went
to
the
billiard
room
soon
after
dinner
and
fräulein
and
mary
sat
by
the
fire
looking
on
while
the
two
young
men
played
in
such
an
evening
there
was
no
time
for
bitter
memories
and
john
hammond
was
surprised
to
find
how
little
he
had
missed
that
enchantress
whose
absence
had
made
the
house
seem
desolate
to
him
when
he
it
he
was
tired
with
his
journey
and
the
varying
emotions
of
the
day
for
it
was
not
without
strong
emotion
that
he
had
consented
to
return
to
fellside
and
he
slept
soundly
for
the
earlier
part
of
the
night
but
he
had
trained
himself
long
ago
to
do
with
a
very
moderate
portion
of
sleep
and
he
was
up
and
dressed
while
the
dawn
was
still
slowly
creeping
along
the
edges
of
the
hills
he
went
quietly
down
to
the
hall
took
one
of
the
bamboos
from
a
collection
of
canes
and
mountain
sticks
and
set
out
upon
a
morning
ramble
over
the
snowy
slopes
the
snow
showers
of
yesterday
had
only
sprinkled
the
greensward
upon
the
lower
ground
but
in
the
upper
regions
the
winter
snows
still
lingered
giving
an
alpine
character
to
the
landscape
john
hammond
was
too
experienced
a
mountaineer
to
be
deterred
by
a
little
snow
he
went
up
silver
howe
and
from
the
rugged
breast
of
the
mountain
saw
the
sun
leap
up
from
amidst
a
chaos
of
hill
and
crag
in
all
his
majesty
while
the
grey
mists
of
night
slowly
floated
up
from
the
valley
that
had
lain
hidden
below
them
and
grasmere
lake
sparkled
and
flashed
in
the
light
of
the
sun
the
church
clock
was
striking
eight
as
hammond
came
at
a
brisk
pace
down
to
the
valley
there
was
still
an
hour
before
breakfast
so
he
took
a
circuitous
path
to
fellside
and
descended
upon
the
house
from
the
fell
as
he
had
done
that
summer
morning
when
he
saw
james
steadman
sauntering
about
in
his
garden
within
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
lady
maulevrier
shrubberies
hammond
encountered
a
pedestrian
who
like
himself
was
evidently
taking
a
constitutional
ramble
in
the
morning
air
but
on
a
much
less
extended
scale
for
this
person
did
not
look
capable
of
going
far
afield
he
was
an
old
man
something
under
middle
height
but
looking
as
if
he
had
once
been
taller
for
his
shoulders
were
much
bent
and
his
head
was
sunk
on
his
chest
his
whole
form
looked
wasted
and
shrunken
and
john
hammond
thought
he
had
never
seen
so
old
a
man
or
at
any
rate
any
man
who
was
so
deeply
marked
with
all
the
signs
of
extreme
age
and
yet
in
the
backwoods
of
america
he
had
met
ancient
settlers
who
remembered
franklin
and
who
had
been
boys
when
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
was
fresh
in
the
memory
of
their
fathers
and
mothers
the
little
old
man
was
clad
in
a
thick
grey
overcoat
of
some
shaggy
kind
of
cloth
which
looked
like
homespun
he
wore
a
felt
hat
and
carried
a
thick
oak
stick
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
to
indicate
that
he
belonged
to
any
higher
grade
than
that
of
the
shepherds
and
guides
with
whom
hammond
had
made
himself
familiar
during
his
previous
visit
and
yet
there
was
something
distinctive
about
the
man
hammond
thought
something
wild
and
uncanny
which
made
him
unlike
any
of
those
hale
and
dalesmen
on
whom
old
age
sate
so
lightly
no
john
hammond
could
not
fancy
this
man
with
his
pallid
countenance
and
pale
crafty
eyes
to
be
of
the
same
race
as
those
rugged
and
descendants
of
the
norsemen
perhaps
it
was
the
man
exceeding
age
for
john
hammond
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
be
a
centenarian
which
gave
him
so
strange
and
unholy
an
air
he
had
the
aspect
of
a
man
who
had
been
buried
and
brought
back
to
life
again
so
might
look
one
of
those
indian
fakirs
who
have
the
power
to
suspend
life
by
some
mysterious
process
and
to
lie
in
the
darkness
of
the
grave
for
a
given
period
and
then
at
their
own
will
to
resume
the
functions
of
the
living
his
long
white
hair
fell
upon
the
collar
of
his
grey
coat
and
would
have
given
him
a
patriarchal
appearance
had
the
face
possessed
the
dignity
of
age
but
it
was
a
countenance
without
dignity
a
face
deeply
scored
with
the
lines
of
evil
passions
and
guilty
memories
the
face
of
the
vulture
with
a
touch
of
the
ferret
altogether
a
most
unpleasant
face
hammond
thought
and
yet
there
was
a
kind
of
fascination
about
that
bent
and
shrunken
figure
those
feeble
movements
and
shuffling
gait
john
hammond
turned
to
look
after
the
old
man
when
he
had
passed
him
and
stood
to
watch
him
as
he
went
slowly
up
the
fell
plant
his
crutch
stick
upon
the
ground
before
every
footstep
as
if
it
were
a
third
leg
and
more
serviceable
than
either
of
the
other
two
hammond
watched
him
for
two
or
three
minutes
but
as
the
old
movements
had
an
automatic
regularity
the
occupation
soon
palled
and
he
turned
and
walked
toward
fellside
a
few
yards
nearer
the
grounds
he
met
james
steadman
walking
briskly
and
smoking
his
morning
pipe
are
out
early
this
morning
said
hammond
by
way
of
civility
am
always
pretty
early
sir
i
like
a
mouthful
of
morning
air
do
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
a
old
man
i
passed
just
now
a
little
higher
up
the
fell
such
an
old
old
man
with
long
white
hair
sir
i
believe
i
know
him
is
he
does
he
live
in
grasmere
steadman
looked
puzzled
you
see
sir
your
description
might
apply
to
a
good
many
but
if
it
the
man
i
think
you
mean
he
lives
in
one
of
the
cottages
behind
the
church
old
barlow
they
call
him
ca
be
two
such
men
he
must
be
at
least
a
century
old
if
any
one
told
me
he
were
a
hundred
and
twenty
i
should
be
inclined
to
doubt
the
fact
i
never
saw
such
a
shrivelled
wrinkled
visage
bloodless
too
as
if
the
poor
old
wretch
never
felt
your
fresh
mountain
air
upon
his
hollow
cheeks
a
dreadful
face
it
will
haunt
me
for
a
month
must
be
old
barlow
replied
steadman
day
sir
he
walked
on
with
his
swinging
step
and
at
such
a
pace
that
he
was
up
the
side
of
the
fell
and
close
upon
old
barlow
heels
when
hammond
turned
to
look
after
him
five
minutes
later
a
man
who
shows
few
traces
of
age
at
any
rate
thought
hammond
her
ladyship
told
me
that
he
is
over
seventy
chapter
xix
the
old
man
on
the
fell
having
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
at
fellside
until
after
easter
maulevrier
settled
down
very
quietly
for
him
he
rode
a
good
deal
fished
a
little
looked
after
his
dogs
played
billiards
made
a
devout
appearance
in
the
big
square
pew
at
oswald
on
sunday
mornings
and
behaved
altogether
as
a
reformed
character
even
his
grandmother
was
fain
to
admit
that
maulevrier
was
improved
and
that
influence
upon
him
must
be
exercised
for
good
and
not
for
evil
plunged
awfully
last
year
and
the
year
before
that
said
maulevrier
sitting
at
tea
in
her
ladyship
morning
room
one
afternoon
about
a
week
after
his
return
when
she
had
expressed
her
gracious
desire
that
the
two
young
men
should
take
tea
with
her
mary
was
in
charge
of
the
and
brass
kettle
and
looked
as
radiant
and
as
fresh
as
a
summer
morning
a
regular
gainsborough
girl
hammond
called
her
when
he
praised
her
to
her
brother
a
true
english
beauty
unsophisticated
a
little
rustic
but
full
of
youthful
sweetness
see
i
did
know
what
a
racing
stable
meant
continued
maulevrier
mildly
apologetic
fact
i
thought
it
was
an
easy
way
for
a
nobleman
to
make
as
good
a
living
as
your
city
swells
with
their
soft
goods
or
their
brummagem
ware
a
respectable
trade
for
a
gentleman
to
engage
in
and
it
was
only
when
i
was
half
ruined
that
i
began
to
understand
the
business
and
as
soon
as
i
did
understand
it
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
out
of
it
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
i
sold
the
very
last
of
my
stud
in
february
and
tony
lumpkin
is
his
own
man
again
so
you
may
welcome
the
prodigal
grandson
and
order
the
fatted
calf
to
be
slain
grandmother
lady
maulevrier
stretched
out
her
left
hand
to
him
and
the
young
man
bent
over
it
and
kissed
it
affectionately
he
felt
really
touched
by
her
misfortunes
and
was
fonder
of
her
than
he
had
ever
been
before
she
had
been
somewhat
hard
with
him
in
his
boyhood
but
she
had
always
cared
for
his
dignity
and
protected
his
interests
and
after
all
she
was
a
noble
old
woman
a
grandmother
of
whom
a
man
might
be
justly
proud
he
thought
of
the
painted
harridans
the
skeletons
whom
some
of
his
young
friends
were
obliged
to
own
in
the
same
capacity
and
he
was
thankful
that
he
could
reverence
his
father
mother
is
the
best
news
i
have
heard
for
a
long
time
maulevrier
said
her
ladyship
graciously
medicine
for
my
nerves
than
any
of
horton
preparations
if
hammond
advice
has
influenced
you
to
get
rid
of
your
stable
i
am
deeply
grateful
to
mr
hammond
hammond
smiled
as
he
sipped
his
tea
sitting
close
to
mary
tray
ready
to
fly
to
her
assistance
on
the
instant
should
the
brazen
kettle
become
troublesome
it
had
a
threatening
way
of
hissing
and
bubbling
over
its
spirit
lamp
you
have
no
idea
what
a
fellow
hammond
is
to
lecture
answered
maulevrier
is
a
tremendous
radical
and
he
thinks
that
every
young
man
in
my
position
ought
to
be
a
reformer
and
devote
the
greater
part
of
his
time
and
trouble
to
turning
out
the
dirty
corners
of
the
world
upsetting
those
poor
dear
families
who
like
to
pig
together
in
one
room
ordering
all
the
children
off
to
school
marrying
the
fathers
and
mothers
thrusting
himself
between
free
labour
and
free
beer
and
interfering
with
the
liberty
of
the
subject
in
every
direction
that
may
sound
like
radicalism
but
i
think
it
is
the
true
conservatism
and
that
every
young
man
ought
to
do
as
much
if
he
wants
this
timeworn
old
country
to
maintain
its
power
and
prosperity
answered
lady
maulevrier
with
an
approving
glance
at
john
thoughtful
face
you
are
grandmother
returned
maulevrier
i
believe
hammond
calls
himself
a
conservative
and
means
to
vote
with
the
conservatives
means
to
vote
an
idle
phrase
surely
thought
her
ladyship
where
the
young
man
chance
of
getting
into
parliament
was
so
remote
that
afternoon
tea
in
lady
maulevrier
room
was
almost
as
cheerful
as
the
in
the
unrestrained
by
her
presence
she
was
pleased
with
her
grandson
conduct
and
was
therefore
inclined
to
be
friendly
to
his
friend
she
could
see
an
improvement
in
mary
too
the
girl
was
more
feminine
more
subdued
graver
sweeter
more
like
that
ideal
woman
of
wordsworth
whose
image
embodies
all
that
is
purest
and
fairest
in
womanhood
mary
had
not
forgotten
that
unlucky
story
about
the
and
ever
since
hammond
return
she
had
been
as
it
were
on
her
best
behaviour
refraining
from
her
races
with
the
terriers
and
holding
herself
aloof
from
maulevrier
masculine
pursuits
she
sheltered
herself
a
good
deal
under
the
fräulein
substantial
wing
and
took
care
never
to
intrude
herself
upon
the
amusements
of
her
brother
and
his
friend
she
was
not
one
of
those
young
women
who
think
a
brother
presence
an
excuse
for
a
perpetual
with
a
young
man
yet
when
maulevrier
came
in
quest
of
her
and
entreated
her
to
join
them
in
a
ramble
she
was
not
too
prudish
to
refuse
the
pleasure
she
so
thoroughly
enjoyed
but
afternoon
tea
was
her
privileged
hour
the
time
at
which
she
wore
her
prettiest
frock
and
forgot
to
regret
her
inferiority
to
lesbia
in
all
the
graces
of
womanhood
one
afternoon
when
they
had
all
three
walked
to
easedale
tarn
and
were
coming
back
by
the
side
of
the
force
picking
their
way
among
the
grey
stones
and
the
narrow
threads
of
silvery
water
it
suddenly
occurred
to
hammond
to
ask
mary
about
that
queer
old
man
he
had
seen
on
the
fell
nearly
a
fortnight
before
he
had
often
thought
of
making
the
inquiry
when
he
was
away
from
mary
but
had
always
forgotten
the
thing
when
he
was
with
her
indeed
mary
had
a
wonderful
knack
of
making
him
forget
everything
but
herself
seem
to
know
every
creature
in
grasmere
down
to
the
babies
said
hammond
mary
having
just
stopped
to
converse
with
an
infantine
group
straggling
and
struggling
over
the
boulders
do
you
happen
to
know
a
man
called
barlow
a
very
old
man
sam
barlow
exclaimed
mary
of
course
i
know
him
she
said
it
as
if
he
were
a
near
relative
and
the
question
palpably
absurd
is
an
old
man
a
hundred
at
least
i
should
think
said
hammond
old
sam
not
much
on
the
wrong
side
of
eighty
i
go
to
see
him
every
week
and
take
him
his
week
tobacco
poor
old
dear
it
is
his
only
comfort
it
asked
hammond
should
have
doubted
his
having
so
humanising
a
taste
as
tobacco
he
looks
too
evil
a
creature
ever
to
have
yielded
to
the
softening
influence
of
a
pipe
evil
creature
what
old
sam
why
he
is
the
most
genial
old
thing
and
as
cheery
loves
to
hear
the
newspaper
read
to
him
the
murders
and
railway
accidents
he
does
care
for
politics
everybody
likes
old
sam
barlow
fancy
the
grasmere
idea
of
reverend
and
amiable
age
must
be
strictly
local
i
can
only
say
that
i
never
saw
a
more
unholy
countenance
must
have
been
dreaming
when
you
saw
him
said
mary
did
you
meet
him
the
fell
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
shrubbery
gate
you
i
should
have
thought
he
could
have
got
so
far
i
a
good
mind
to
take
you
to
see
him
this
very
afternoon
before
we
go
home
exclaimed
hammond
should
like
it
immensely
i
thought
him
a
old
person
but
there
was
something
so
thoroughly
uncanny
about
him
that
he
exercised
an
absolute
fascination
upon
me
he
magnetised
me
i
think
as
the
cat
magnetises
the
bird
i
have
been
positively
longing
to
see
him
again
he
is
a
kind
of
human
monster
and
i
hope
some
one
will
have
a
big
bottle
made
ready
for
him
and
preserve
him
in
spirits
when
he
dies
a
horrid
idea
no
sir
dear
old
barlow
shall
lie
beside
the
rotha
under
the
trees
wordsworth
planted
he
is
such
a
man
as
wordsworth
would
have
loved
hammond
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
no
more
mary
little
vehement
ways
her
enthusiasm
her
love
of
that
valley
which
might
be
called
her
native
place
albeit
her
eyes
had
opened
upon
heaven
light
far
away
her
humility
were
all
very
delightful
in
their
way
she
was
not
a
perfect
beauty
like
lesbia
but
she
was
a
fresh
english
girl
frank
as
the
day
and
if
he
had
had
a
brother
he
would
have
recommended
that
brother
to
choose
just
such
a
girl
for
his
wife
samuel
barlow
occupied
a
little
old
cottage
which
seemed
to
consist
chiefly
of
a
gable
end
and
a
chimney
stack
in
that
cluster
of
dwellings
behind
oswald
church
which
was
once
known
as
the
kirk
town
visitors
went
downstairs
to
get
to
barlow
for
the
influence
of
time
and
advancing
civilisation
had
raised
the
pathway
in
front
of
barlow
cottage
until
his
parlour
had
become
of
a
aspect
yet
it
was
a
very
nice
little
parlour
when
one
got
down
to
it
and
it
enjoyed
winter
and
summer
a
perpetual
twilight
since
the
light
that
crept
through
the
leaded
casement
was
tempered
by
a
screen
of
flowerpots
which
were
old
barlow
particular
care
there
were
no
finer
geraniums
in
all
grasmere
than
barlow
no
bigger
carnations
or
picotees
asters
or
arums
it
was
about
five
in
the
march
afternoon
when
mary
ushered
john
hammond
into
barlow
dwelling
and
in
the
dim
glow
of
a
cheery
little
fire
and
the
faint
light
that
filtered
through
the
screen
of
geranium
leaves
the
visitor
looked
for
a
moment
or
so
doubtfully
at
the
owner
of
the
cottage
but
only
for
a
moment
those
bright
blue
eyes
and
apple
cheeks
that
benevolent
expression
bore
no
likeness
to
the
strange
old
man
he
had
seen
on
the
fell
barlow
was
toothless
and
like
of
outline
he
was
thin
and
shrunken
and
bent
with
the
burden
of
long
years
but
his
healthy
visage
had
none
of
those
deep
lines
those
cross
markings
and
hollows
which
made
the
pallid
countenance
of
that
other
old
man
as
ghastly
as
would
be
the
abstract
idea
of
life
last
stage
embodied
by
the
bitter
pencil
of
a
hogarth
have
brought
a
gentleman
from
london
to
see
you
sam
said
mary
fancied
he
met
you
on
the
fell
the
other
morning
barlow
rose
and
quavered
a
cheery
welcome
but
protested
against
the
idea
of
his
having
got
so
far
as
the
fell
my
blessed
rheumatics
you
know
it
is
in
me
lady
mary
i
shall
never
get
no
further
than
the
churchyard
but
i
likes
to
sit
on
the
wall
hard
by
wordsworth
tomb
in
a
warm
afternoon
and
to
see
the
folks
pass
over
the
bridge
and
i
can
potter
about
looking
after
my
flowers
i
can
but
it
would
be
a
dull
life
now
the
poor
old
missus
is
gone
and
the
bairns
all
out
at
service
if
it
was
for
some
one
dropping
in
to
have
a
chat
or
read
me
a
bit
of
the
news
sometimes
and
there
is
anybody
in
grasmere
gentle
or
simple
that
kinder
to
me
than
you
lady
mary
lord
bless
you
i
do
look
forward
to
my
newspaper
any
more
of
them
dreadful
smashes
sam
thank
heaven
there
have
been
no
railway
accidents
we
shall
have
in
august
and
september
said
the
old
man
cheerily
bound
to
come
then
there
a
time
for
all
things
as
solomon
says
when
the
season
comes
all
coom
and
no
more
of
these
mysterious
murders
i
suppose
which
baffle
and
keep
me
awake
o
nights
thinking
of
you
do
not
take
delight
in
murder
mr
barlow
said
hammond
sir
i
do
not
wish
my
to
mak
awa
wi
each
other
but
if
there
is
a
murder
going
in
the
papers
i
like
to
get
the
benefit
of
it
i
like
to
sit
in
front
of
my
fire
of
an
evening
and
wonder
about
it
while
i
smoke
my
pipe
and
fancy
i
can
see
the
murderer
hiding
in
a
garret
in
an
alley
or
as
a
stowaway
on
board
a
gert
ship
or
as
a
miner
deep
down
in
a
coalpit
and
never
thinking
that
even
there
can
track
him
did
you
ever
hear
tell
o
de
quincey
sir
believe
i
have
read
every
line
he
ever
wrote
you
should
have
heard
him
talk
about
murders
it
would
have
made
you
dream
queer
dreams
just
as
he
did
he
lived
for
years
in
the
white
cottage
that
wordsworth
once
lived
in
just
behind
the
street
yonder
a
nice
neat
lile
gentleman
in
a
houseful
of
books
i
had
many
a
talk
with
him
when
i
was
a
young
man
how
old
may
you
be
now
mr
barlow
on
for
eighty
four
sir
you
are
not
the
oldest
man
in
grasmere
i
should
say
by
twenty
years
do
think
there
many
much
older
than
me
sir
man
i
saw
on
the
fell
looked
at
least
a
hundred
i
wish
you
could
tell
me
who
he
is
i
feel
a
morbid
curiosity
about
him
he
went
on
to
describe
the
old
man
in
the
grey
coat
as
minutely
as
he
could
dwelling
on
every
characteristic
of
that
old
person
but
samuel
barlow
could
not
identify
the
description
with
any
one
in
grasmere
yet
a
man
of
that
age
seen
walking
on
the
at
eight
in
the
morning
could
hardly
have
come
from
far
afield
chapter
xx
lady
maulevrier
although
maulevrier
had
assured
his
grandmother
that
john
hammond
would
take
flight
at
the
first
warning
of
lesbia
return
lady
dread
of
any
meeting
between
her
granddaughter
and
that
ineligible
lover
determined
her
in
making
such
arrangements
as
should
banish
lesbia
from
fellside
so
long
as
there
seemed
the
slightest
danger
of
such
a
meeting
she
knew
that
lesbia
had
loved
her
fortuneless
suitor
and
she
did
not
know
that
the
wound
was
cured
even
by
a
season
in
the
world
of
cannes
now
that
she
the
ruler
of
that
household
was
a
helpless
captive
in
her
own
apartments
she
felt
that
lesbia
at
fellside
would
be
her
own
mistress
and
hemmed
round
with
the
dangers
that
beset
beauty
and
inexperienced
youth
john
hammond
might
be
playing
a
very
deep
game
perhaps
assisted
by
maulevrier
he
might
ostensibly
leave
fellside
before
lesbia
return
yet
lurk
in
the
neighbourhood
and
contrive
to
meet
her
every
day
if
maulevrier
encouraged
this
folly
they
might
be
married
and
over
the
border
before
her
ladyship
fettered
impotent
as
she
was
could
interfere
lady
maulevrier
felt
that
georgie
kirkbank
was
her
strong
rock
so
long
as
lesbia
was
under
that
astute
veteran
wing
there
could
be
no
danger
in
that
embodied
essence
of
worldliness
and
diplomacy
there
was
an
defence
from
all
temptations
that
spring
from
romance
and
youthful
impulses
it
was
a
bitter
thing
perhaps
to
steep
a
young
and
pure
soul
in
such
an
atmosphere
to
harden
a
fresh
young
nature
in
the
fiery
crucible
of
fashionable
life
but
lady
maulevrier
believed
that
the
end
would
sanctify
the
means
lesbia
once
married
to
a
worthy
man
such
a
man
as
lord
hartfield
for
instance
would
soon
rise
to
a
higher
level
than
that
belgravian
swamp
over
which
the
malarian
vapours
of
falsehood
and
slander
and
and
prurient
imaginings
hang
dense
and
thick
she
would
rise
to
the
loftier
of
that
really
great
world
which
governs
and
admonishes
the
ruck
of
mankind
by
examples
of
noble
deeds
and
noble
thoughts
the
world
of
statesmen
and
soldiers
and
thinkers
and
reformers
the
salt
wherewithal
society
is
salted
but
while
lesbia
was
treading
the
tortuous
mazes
of
fashion
it
was
well
for
her
to
be
guided
and
guarded
by
such
an
old
campaigner
as
lady
kirkbank
a
woman
who
in
the
language
of
her
friends
the
ropes
lesbia
last
letter
had
been
to
the
effect
that
she
was
to
go
back
to
london
with
the
kirkbanks
directly
after
easter
and
that
directly
they
arrived
she
would
set
off
with
her
maid
for
fellside
to
spend
a
week
or
a
fortnight
with
her
dearest
grandmother
before
going
back
to
arlington
street
for
the
may
campaign
then
dearest
i
hope
you
will
make
up
your
mind
to
spend
the
season
in
london
wrote
lesbia
shall
expect
to
hear
that
you
have
secured
lord
porlock
house
how
dreadfully
slow
your
poor
dear
hand
is
to
recover
i
am
afraid
horton
is
not
treating
the
case
cleverly
why
do
you
not
send
for
erichsen
it
is
a
shock
to
my
nerves
every
time
i
receive
a
letter
in
mary
masculine
hand
instead
of
in
your
lovely
italian
penmanship
strange
is
it
how
much
better
the
women
of
your
time
write
than
the
girls
of
the
present
day
lady
kirkbank
receives
letters
from
stylish
girls
in
a
hand
that
would
disgrace
a
housemaid
lady
maulevrier
allowed
a
post
to
go
by
before
she
answered
this
letter
while
she
deliberated
upon
the
best
and
wisest
manner
of
arranging
her
granddaughter
future
it
was
an
agony
to
her
not
to
be
able
to
write
with
her
own
hand
to
be
obliged
to
so
shape
every
sentence
that
mary
might
learn
nothing
which
she
ought
not
to
know
it
was
impossible
with
such
an
amanuensis
to
write
confidentially
to
lady
kirkbank
the
letters
to
lesbia
were
of
less
consequence
for
lesbia
albeit
so
intensely
beloved
was
not
in
her
grandmother
confidence
least
of
all
about
those
schemes
and
dreams
which
concerned
her
own
fate
however
the
letters
had
to
be
written
so
mary
was
told
to
open
her
desk
and
begin
the
letter
to
lesbia
ran
thus
dearest
child
is
a
world
in
which
our
brightest
generally
end
in
mere
dreaming
for
years
past
i
have
cherished
the
hope
of
presenting
you
to
your
sovereign
to
whom
i
was
presented
six
and
forty
years
ago
when
she
was
so
fair
and
girlish
a
creature
that
she
seemed
to
me
more
like
a
queen
in
a
fairy
tale
than
the
actual
ruler
of
a
great
country
i
have
beguiled
my
monotonous
days
with
thoughts
of
the
time
when
i
should
return
to
the
great
world
full
of
pride
and
delight
in
showing
old
friends
what
a
sweet
flower
i
had
reared
in
my
mountain
home
but
alas
lesbia
it
may
not
be
has
willed
otherwise
the
maimed
hand
does
not
recover
although
horton
is
very
clever
and
thoroughly
understands
my
case
i
am
not
ill
i
am
not
in
danger
so
you
need
feel
no
anxiety
about
me
but
i
am
a
cripple
and
i
am
likely
to
remain
a
cripple
for
months
so
the
idea
of
a
london
season
this
year
is
hopeless
as
you
have
in
a
manner
made
your
at
cannes
it
would
never
do
to
bury
you
here
for
another
year
you
complained
of
the
dullness
last
summer
but
you
would
find
fellside
much
duller
now
that
you
have
tasted
the
elixir
of
life
no
my
dear
love
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
be
presented
as
lady
kirkbank
proposes
at
the
first
after
easter
and
lady
kirkbank
will
have
to
present
you
she
will
be
pleased
to
do
this
i
know
for
her
letters
are
full
of
enthusiasm
about
you
and
after
all
i
do
not
think
you
will
lose
by
the
exchange
clever
as
i
think
myself
i
fear
i
should
find
myself
sorely
at
fault
in
the
society
of
all
things
are
changed
opinions
manners
creeds
morals
even
acts
that
were
crimes
in
my
day
are
now
venial
errors
opinions
that
were
scandalous
are
now
the
mark
of
advanced
thought
i
should
be
too
formal
for
this
age
should
be
ridiculed
as
and
should
put
you
to
the
blush
a
dozen
times
a
day
by
my
prejudices
and
opinions
is
very
good
of
you
to
think
of
travelling
so
long
a
distance
to
see
me
and
i
should
love
to
look
at
your
sweet
face
and
hear
you
describe
your
new
experiences
but
i
could
not
allow
you
to
travel
with
only
the
protection
of
a
maid
and
there
are
many
reasons
why
i
think
it
better
to
defer
the
meeting
till
the
end
of
the
season
when
lady
kirkbank
will
bring
my
treasure
back
to
me
eager
to
tell
me
the
history
of
all
the
hearts
she
has
broken
the
dowager
letter
to
lady
kirkbank
was
brief
and
she
could
only
hope
that
her
old
friend
georgie
whose
acuteness
she
knew
of
old
would
divine
her
feelings
and
her
wishes
without
being
explicitly
told
what
they
were
dear
georgie
am
too
ill
to
leave
this
house
indeed
i
doubt
if
i
shall
ever
leave
it
till
i
am
taken
away
in
my
coffin
but
please
say
nothing
to
alarm
lesbia
indeed
there
is
no
ground
for
fear
as
i
am
not
dangerously
ill
and
may
drag
out
an
imprisonment
of
long
years
before
the
coffin
comes
to
fetch
me
there
are
reasons
which
you
will
understand
why
lesbia
should
not
come
here
till
after
the
season
so
please
keep
her
in
arlington
street
and
occupy
her
mind
as
much
as
you
can
with
the
preparations
for
her
first
campaign
i
give
you
if
carson
is
still
in
business
i
should
like
her
to
make
my
girl
gowns
but
you
must
please
yourself
in
this
matter
as
it
is
quite
possible
that
carson
is
a
little
behind
the
times
must
ask
you
to
present
my
darling
and
to
deal
with
her
exactly
as
if
she
were
a
daughter
of
your
own
i
think
you
know
all
my
views
and
hopes
about
her
and
i
feel
that
i
can
trust
to
your
friendship
in
this
my
day
of
need
the
dream
of
my
life
has
been
to
launch
her
myself
and
direct
her
every
step
in
the
mazes
of
town
life
but
that
dream
is
over
i
have
kept
age
and
infirmity
at
a
distance
have
even
forgotten
that
the
years
were
going
by
and
now
i
find
myself
an
old
woman
all
at
once
and
my
golden
dream
has
vanished
lady
kirkbank
reply
came
by
return
of
post
and
happily
this
gushing
epistle
had
not
to
be
submitted
to
mary
eye
dearest
di
heart
positively
bleeds
for
you
what
is
the
matter
with
your
hand
that
you
talk
of
being
a
prisoner
to
your
room
pray
send
for
paget
or
erichsen
and
have
yourself
put
right
at
once
no
doubt
that
local
simpleton
is
making
a
mess
of
your
case
perhaps
while
he
is
dabbing
with
lint
and
lotions
the
real
remedy
is
the
knife
i
am
sure
amputation
would
be
less
melancholy
than
the
despondent
state
of
feeling
which
you
are
now
suffering
if
any
limb
of
mine
went
wrong
i
should
say
to
the
surgeon
cut
it
off
and
patch
up
the
stump
in
your
best
style
i
give
you
a
fortnight
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
expect
to
be
going
to
parties
again
life
is
not
long
enough
for
dawdling
surgery
regards
lesbia
i
can
only
say
that
i
adore
her
and
i
am
enchanted
at
the
idea
that
i
am
to
run
her
myself
i
intend
her
to
be
beauty
of
the
season
not
of
the
loveliest
or
any
rot
of
that
kind
but
just
the
girl
whom
everybody
will
be
crazy
about
there
shall
be
a
mob
wherever
she
appears
di
i
promise
you
that
there
is
no
one
in
london
who
can
work
a
thing
of
that
kind
better
than
your
humble
servant
and
when
once
the
girl
is
the
talk
of
the
town
all
the
rest
is
easy
she
can
choose
for
herself
among
the
very
best
men
in
society
offers
will
pour
in
as
thickly
as
circulars
from
undertakers
and
mourning
warehouses
after
a
death
is
so
and
sensible
that
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
her
success
with
an
impulsive
or
romantic
girl
there
is
always
the
fear
of
a
but
this
sweet
child
of
yours
has
been
well
brought
up
and
knows
her
own
value
she
behaved
like
a
queen
here
where
i
need
not
tell
you
society
is
just
a
little
mixed
though
of
course
we
only
cultivate
our
own
set
your
heart
would
swell
with
pride
if
you
could
see
the
way
she
puts
down
men
who
are
not
quite
good
style
and
the
ease
with
which
she
crushes
those
odious
american
girls
with
their
fine
complexions
and
loud
manners
assured
that
i
shall
guard
her
as
the
apple
of
my
eye
and
that
the
detrimental
who
circumvents
me
will
be
a
very
satan
of
schemers
can
but
smile
at
your
mention
of
carson
whose
gowns
used
to
fit
us
so
well
in
our
girlish
days
and
whose
bills
seem
moderate
compared
with
the
exorbitant
accounts
i
get
now
has
long
been
forgotten
my
dear
soul
gone
with
the
snows
of
last
year
a
long
procession
of
fashionable
french
dressmakers
has
passed
across
the
stage
since
her
time
like
the
phantom
kings
in
macbeth
and
now
the
last
rage
is
to
have
our
gowns
made
by
an
englishman
who
works
for
the
princess
and
who
gives
himself
most
insufferable
airs
or
an
irishwoman
who
is
employed
by
all
the
best
actresses
it
is
to
the
latter
kate
kearney
i
shall
entrust
our
sweet
lesbia
toilettes
the
same
post
brought
a
loving
letter
from
lesbia
full
of
regret
at
not
being
allowed
to
go
down
to
fellside
and
yet
full
of
delight
at
the
prospect
of
her
first
season
kirkbank
and
i
have
been
discussing
my
court
dress
she
wrote
we
have
decided
upon
a
white
train
with
a
border
of
ostrich
feathers
over
a
satin
petticoat
embroidered
with
seed
pearl
it
will
be
expensive
but
we
know
you
will
not
mind
that
lady
kirkbank
takes
the
idea
from
the
costume
buckingham
wore
at
the
louvre
the
first
time
he
met
anne
of
austria
is
that
clever
of
her
she
is
not
a
deep
thinker
like
you
is
horribly
ignorant
of
science
metaphysics
poetry
even
she
asked
me
one
day
who
plato
was
and
whether
he
took
his
name
from
the
battle
of
platoea
and
she
says
she
never
could
understand
why
people
make
a
fuss
about
shakespeare
but
she
has
read
all
the
secret
histories
and
memoirs
that
ever
were
written
and
knows
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
court
life
and
high
life
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
and
there
is
not
a
person
in
the
peerage
whose
family
history
she
has
not
at
her
fingers
ends
except
my
grandfather
when
i
asked
her
to
tell
me
all
about
lord
maulevrier
and
his
achievements
as
governor
of
madras
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
so
perhaps
she
draws
upon
her
invention
a
little
in
talking
about
other
people
and
felt
herself
restrained
when
she
came
to
speak
of
my
grandfather
this
passage
in
lesbia
letter
affected
lady
maulevrier
as
if
a
scorpion
had
wriggled
from
underneath
the
sheet
of
paper
she
folded
the
letter
and
laid
it
in
the
box
on
her
table
with
a
deep
sigh
she
is
in
the
world
now
and
she
will
ask
questions
i
have
never
warned
her
against
pronouncing
her
grandfather
name
there
are
some
who
will
not
be
so
kind
as
georgie
kirkbank
some
perhaps
who
will
delight
in
humiliating
her
and
who
will
tell
her
the
worst
that
can
be
told
my
only
hope
is
that
she
will
make
a
great
marriage
and
speedily
once
the
wife
of
a
man
with
a
high
place
in
the
world
worldlings
will
be
too
wise
to
wound
her
by
telling
her
that
her
grandfather
was
an
unconvicted
felon
the
die
was
cast
lady
maulevrier
might
dread
the
hazard
of
evil
tongues
of
slanderous
memories
but
she
could
not
recall
her
consent
to
lesbia
the
girl
was
already
launched
she
had
been
seen
and
admired
the
next
stage
in
her
career
must
be
to
be
wooed
and
won
by
a
worthy
wooer
chapter
xxi
on
the
dark
brow
of
helvellyn
while
these
plans
were
being
settled
and
while
lesbia
future
was
the
subject
of
lady
maulevrier
thoughts
mary
contrived
to
be
happier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
before
it
was
happiness
that
grew
and
strengthened
with
every
day
and
yet
there
was
no
obvious
reason
for
this
deep
joy
her
life
ran
in
the
same
familiar
groove
she
walked
and
rode
on
the
old
pathways
she
rowed
on
the
lake
she
had
known
from
babyhood
she
visited
her
cottagers
and
taught
in
the
village
school
just
the
same
as
of
old
the
change
was
only
that
she
was
no
longer
alone
and
of
late
the
solitude
of
her
life
the
consciousness
that
nobody
shared
her
pleasures
or
sympathised
with
her
upon
any
point
had
weighed
upon
her
like
an
actual
burden
now
she
had
maulevrier
who
was
always
kind
who
understood
and
shared
almost
all
her
tastes
and
maulevrier
friend
who
although
not
given
to
saying
smooth
things
seemed
warmly
interested
in
her
pursuits
and
opinions
he
encouraged
her
to
talk
although
he
generally
took
the
opposite
side
in
every
argument
and
she
no
longer
felt
oppressed
or
irritated
by
the
idea
that
he
despised
her
indeed
although
he
never
flattered
or
even
praised
her
hammond
let
her
see
that
he
liked
her
society
she
had
gone
out
of
her
way
to
avoid
him
very
fearful
lest
he
should
think
her
bold
or
masculine
but
he
had
taken
pains
to
frustrate
all
her
efforts
in
that
direction
he
had
refused
to
go
upon
excursions
which
she
could
not
share
mary
must
come
with
us
he
said
when
they
were
planning
a
morning
ramble
thus
it
happened
that
mary
was
his
guide
and
companion
in
all
his
walks
and
roamed
with
him
bamboo
in
hand
over
every
one
of
those
mountainous
paths
she
knew
and
loved
so
well
distance
was
as
nothing
to
them
sometimes
a
boat
helped
them
and
they
went
over
wintry
windermere
to
climb
the
picturesque
heights
above
bowness
sometimes
they
took
ponies
and
a
groom
and
left
their
steeds
to
perform
the
wilder
part
of
the
way
on
foot
in
this
wise
john
hammond
saw
all
that
was
to
be
seen
within
a
day
journey
of
grasmere
except
the
top
of
helvellyn
maulevrier
had
shirked
the
expedition
had
always
put
off
mary
and
hammond
when
they
proposed
it
the
season
was
not
advanced
enough
the
rugged
pathway
by
the
tongue
ghyll
would
be
as
slippery
as
glass
no
pony
could
get
up
there
in
such
weather
have
not
had
any
frost
to
speak
of
for
the
last
fortnight
pleaded
mary
who
was
particularly
anxious
to
do
the
honours
of
helvellyn
as
the
real
lion
of
the
neighbourhood
a
simpleton
you
are
molly
cried
maulevrier
you
suppose
because
there
is
no
frost
in
your
grandmother
garden
and
if
you
were
to
ask
staples
about
his
peaches
he
would
tell
you
a
very
different
story
that
there
a
tropical
atmosphere
on
dolly
waggon
pike
why
wager
the
ice
on
grisdale
tarn
is
thick
enough
for
skating
helvellyn
wo
run
away
child
you
and
hammond
can
dance
the
highland
schottische
on
striding
edge
in
june
if
you
like
hammond
wo
be
here
in
june
said
mary
knows
the
train
service
is
pretty
fair
between
london
and
windermere
hammond
and
i
would
think
nothing
of
putting
ourselves
in
the
mail
on
a
friday
night
and
coming
down
to
spend
saturday
and
sunday
with
you
if
you
are
good
there
came
a
sunny
morning
soon
after
easter
which
seemed
mild
enough
for
june
and
when
hammond
suggested
that
this
was
the
very
day
for
helvellyn
maulevrier
had
not
a
word
to
say
against
the
truth
of
that
proposition
the
weather
had
been
exceptionally
warm
for
the
last
week
and
they
had
played
tennis
and
sat
in
the
garden
just
as
if
it
had
been
actually
summer
patches
of
snow
might
still
linger
on
the
crests
of
the
hills
but
the
approach
to
those
bleak
heights
could
hardly
be
glacial
mary
clasped
her
hands
delightedly
old
maulevrier
she
exclaimed
are
always
good
to
me
and
now
i
shall
be
able
to
show
you
the
red
tarn
the
highest
pool
of
water
in
england
she
said
turning
to
hammond
you
will
see
windermere
winding
like
a
silvery
serpent
between
the
hills
and
grasmere
shining
like
a
jewel
in
the
depth
of
the
valley
and
the
sea
glittering
like
a
line
of
white
light
between
the
edges
of
earth
and
heaven
and
the
dark
scotch
hills
like
couchant
lions
far
away
to
the
north
is
to
say
these
things
are
all
supposed
to
be
on
view
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
but
as
a
peculiar
and
altogether
exceptional
state
of
the
atmosphere
is
essential
to
their
being
seen
i
need
not
tell
you
that
they
are
rarely
visible
said
maulevrier
are
talking
to
old
mountaineers
molly
hammond
has
done
cotapaxi
and
had
his
little
clamber
on
the
equatorial
andes
and
i
well
child
i
have
done
my
righi
and
i
have
always
found
the
boasted
panorama
enveloped
in
dense
fog
wo
be
foggy
said
mary
we
do
the
whole
thing
on
foot
or
shall
i
order
the
ponies
hammond
inquired
the
distance
up
and
down
and
being
told
that
it
involved
only
a
matter
of
eight
miles
decided
upon
walking
walk
and
lead
your
pony
he
said
to
mary
but
mary
declared
herself
quite
capable
of
going
on
foot
so
the
ponies
were
dispensed
with
as
a
possible
encumbrance
this
was
planned
and
discussed
in
the
garden
before
breakfast
fräulein
was
told
that
mary
was
going
for
a
long
walk
with
her
brother
and
hammond
a
walk
which
might
last
over
the
usual
luncheon
hour
so
fräulein
was
not
to
wait
luncheon
mary
went
to
her
grandmother
room
to
pay
her
duty
visit
there
were
no
letters
for
her
to
write
that
morning
so
she
was
perfectly
free
the
three
pedestrians
started
an
hour
after
breakfast
in
light
marching
order
the
two
young
men
wore
their
argyleshire
shooting
clothes
homespun
knickerbockers
and
jackets
hose
knitted
by
highland
lasses
in
inverness
they
carried
a
couple
of
hunting
flasks
filled
with
claret
and
a
couple
of
sandwich
boxes
and
that
was
all
mary
wore
her
substantial
of
olive
tweed
and
a
little
toque
to
match
with
a
silver
mounted
for
her
only
ornament
it
was
a
delicious
morning
the
air
fresh
and
sweet
the
sun
comfortably
warm
a
little
too
warm
perhaps
presently
when
they
had
trodden
the
narrow
path
by
the
tongue
ghyll
and
were
beginning
to
wind
slowly
upwards
over
rough
boulders
and
last
year
bracken
tough
and
brown
and
tangled
towards
that
rugged
wall
of
earth
and
stone
tufted
with
rank
grasses
which
calls
itself
dolly
waggon
pike
here
they
all
came
to
a
and
wiped
the
dews
of
honest
labour
from
their
foreheads
and
here
maulevrier
flung
himself
down
upon
a
big
boulder
with
the
soles
of
his
stout
shooting
boots
in
running
water
and
took
out
his
cigar
case
do
you
like
it
he
asked
his
friend
when
he
had
lighted
his
cigarette
hope
you
are
enjoying
yourself
never
was
happier
in
my
life
answered
hammond
he
was
standing
on
higher
ground
with
mary
at
his
elbow
pointing
out
and
expatiating
upon
the
details
of
the
prospect
there
were
the
lakes
grasmere
a
disk
of
shining
blue
rydal
a
patch
of
silver
and
windermere
winding
amidst
a
labyrinth
of
wooded
hills
you
tired
asked
maulevrier
a
whit
i
forgot
you
had
done
cotapaxi
or
as
much
of
cotapaxi
as
living
mortal
ever
has
done
that
makes
a
difference
i
am
going
home
maulevrier
exclaimed
mary
piteously
am
going
home
you
two
can
go
to
the
top
you
are
both
hardened
mountaineers
and
i
am
not
in
it
with
either
of
you
when
i
rashly
consented
to
a
pedestrian
ascent
of
helvellyn
i
had
forgotten
what
the
gentleman
was
like
and
as
to
dolly
waggon
i
had
actually
forgotten
her
existence
but
now
i
see
the
lady
as
steep
as
the
side
of
a
house
and
as
stony
no
naught
but
herself
can
be
her
parallel
in
stoniness
no
molly
i
will
go
no
further
we
shall
go
down
on
the
other
side
urged
mary
is
a
little
steeper
on
the
cumberland
side
but
not
nearly
so
far
little
steeper
i
can
anything
be
steeper
than
dolly
waggon
yes
you
are
right
it
is
steeper
on
the
cumberland
side
i
remember
coming
down
a
sheer
descent
like
an
exaggerated
but
i
was
on
a
pony
and
it
was
the
brute
i
will
not
go
down
the
cumberland
side
on
my
own
legs
no
molly
not
even
for
you
but
if
you
and
hammond
want
to
go
to
the
top
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
you
he
is
a
skilled
mountaineer
i
trust
you
with
him
mary
blushed
and
made
no
reply
of
all
things
in
the
world
she
least
wanted
to
abandon
the
expedition
yet
to
climb
helvellyn
alone
with
her
brother
friend
would
no
doubt
be
a
terrible
violation
of
those
laws
of
maidenly
propriety
which
fräulein
was
always
expounding
if
mary
were
to
do
this
thing
which
she
longed
to
do
she
must
hazard
a
lecture
from
her
governess
and
probably
a
biting
reproof
from
her
grandmother
you
trust
yourself
with
me
lady
mary
asked
hammond
looking
at
her
with
a
gaze
so
earnest
so
much
more
earnest
than
the
occasion
required
that
her
blushes
deepened
and
her
eyelids
fell
have
done
a
good
deal
of
climbing
in
my
day
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
helvellyn
can
do
to
me
i
promise
to
take
great
care
of
you
if
you
will
come
how
could
she
refuse
how
could
she
for
one
moment
pretend
that
she
did
not
trust
him
that
her
heart
did
not
yearn
to
go
with
him
she
would
have
climbed
the
shingly
steep
of
cotapaxi
with
him
or
crossed
the
great
sahara
with
him
and
feared
nothing
her
trust
in
him
was
infinite
as
infinite
as
her
reverence
and
love
am
afraid
fräulein
would
make
a
fuss
she
faltered
after
a
pause
fräulein
cried
maulevrier
puffing
at
his
cigarette
and
kicking
about
the
stones
in
the
clear
running
water
square
it
with
fräulein
i
give
her
a
pint
of
fiz
with
her
lunch
and
make
her
see
everything
in
a
rosy
hue
the
good
soul
is
fond
of
her
heidseck
you
will
be
back
by
afternoon
tea
why
should
there
be
any
fuss
about
the
matter
hammond
wants
to
see
the
red
tarn
and
you
are
dying
to
show
him
the
way
go
and
joy
go
with
you
both
climbing
a
stony
hill
is
a
form
of
pleasure
to
which
i
have
not
yet
risen
i
shall
stroll
home
at
my
leisure
and
spend
the
afternoon
on
the
sofa
reading
mudie
last
contribution
to
the
comforts
of
home
a
sybarite
said
hammond
lady
mary
we
must
loiter
if
we
are
to
be
back
at
fellside
by
five
mary
looked
at
her
brother
doubtfully
and
he
gave
her
a
little
nod
which
seemed
to
say
by
all
means
so
she
dug
the
end
of
her
staff
into
dolly
rugged
breast
and
mounted
cheerily
stepping
lightly
from
boulder
to
boulder
the
sun
was
not
so
warm
as
it
had
been
ten
minutes
ago
when
maulevrier
flung
himself
down
to
rest
the
sky
had
clouded
over
a
little
and
a
cooler
wind
was
blowing
across
the
breast
of
the
hill
fairfield
yonder
that
long
smooth
slope
of
verdure
which
a
little
while
ago
looked
emerald
green
in
the
sunlight
now
wore
a
soft
and
shadowy
hue
all
the
world
was
greyer
and
dimmer
in
a
moment
as
it
were
and
coniston
lake
in
its
distant
valley
disappeared
beneath
a
veil
of
mist
while
the
shimmering
upon
the
verge
of
the
horizon
melted
and
vanished
among
the
clouds
that
overhung
it
the
weather
changes
very
quickly
in
this
part
of
the
world
sharp
drops
of
rain
came
spitting
at
hammond
and
mary
as
they
climbed
the
crest
of
the
pike
and
stopped
somewhat
breathless
to
look
back
at
maulevrier
he
was
trudging
blithely
down
the
winding
way
and
seemed
to
have
done
wonders
while
they
had
been
doing
very
little
fast
he
is
going
said
mary
is
the
descent
of
avernus
he
is
going
and
we
are
going
upwards
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
life
you
see
answered
hammond
mary
looked
at
him
with
divine
compassion
she
thought
that
for
him
the
hill
of
life
would
be
harder
than
helvellyn
he
was
brave
honest
clever
but
her
grandmother
had
impressed
upon
her
that
modern
civilisation
hardly
has
room
for
a
young
man
who
wants
to
get
on
in
the
world
without
either
fortune
or
powerful
connexions
he
had
better
go
to
australia
and
keep
sheep
than
attempt
the
impossible
at
home
the
rain
was
a
passing
shower
hardly
worth
speaking
of
but
the
glory
of
the
day
was
over
the
sky
was
grey
and
there
were
dark
clouds
creeping
up
from
the
silvery
windermere
had
taken
a
leaden
hue
and
now
they
turned
their
last
fond
look
upon
the
westmoreland
valley
and
set
their
faces
steadily
towards
cumberland
and
the
fine
grassy
plateau
on
the
top
of
the
hill
all
this
was
not
done
in
a
flash
it
took
them
some
time
to
scale
dolly
stubborn
breast
and
it
took
them
another
hour
to
reach
seat
sandal
and
by
the
time
they
came
to
the
iron
gate
in
the
fence
which
at
this
point
divides
the
two
counties
the
atmosphere
had
thickened
ominously
and
dark
wreaths
of
fog
were
floating
about
and
around
them
whirled
here
and
there
by
a
boisterous
wind
which
shrieked
and
roared
at
them
with
savage
fury
as
if
it
were
the
voice
of
some
titan
monarch
of
the
mountain
protesting
against
this
intrusion
upon
his
domain
afraid
you
wo
see
the
scottish
hills
shouted
mary
holding
on
her
little
cloth
hat
she
was
obliged
to
shout
at
the
top
of
her
voice
though
she
was
close
to
hammond
elbow
for
that
shrill
screaming
wind
would
have
drowned
the
voice
of
a
stentor
mind
the
view
replied
hammond
in
the
same
fortissimo
i
really
wish
i
had
brought
you
up
here
if
this
fog
should
get
any
worse
it
may
be
dangerous
fog
is
sure
to
get
worse
said
mary
in
a
brief
lull
of
the
there
is
no
danger
i
know
every
inch
of
the
hill
and
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
i
can
guide
you
if
you
will
trust
me
bravest
of
girls
he
exclaimed
looking
down
at
her
you
yes
i
would
trust
my
life
to
you
my
soul
my
honour
secure
in
your
purity
and
good
faith
never
had
eyes
of
living
man
or
woman
looked
down
upon
her
with
such
tenderness
such
fervent
love
she
looked
up
at
him
looked
with
eyes
which
at
first
bewildered
then
grew
bold
and
lost
themselves
as
it
were
in
the
dark
grey
depths
of
the
eyes
they
met
the
savage
wind
hustling
and
howling
blew
her
nearer
to
him
as
a
reed
is
blown
against
a
rock
dark
grey
mists
were
rising
round
them
like
a
sea
but
had
that
vapour
been
the
sea
itself
and
death
inevitable
mary
haselden
would
have
hardly
cared
for
in
this
moment
the
one
precious
gift
for
which
her
soul
had
long
been
yearning
had
been
freely
given
to
her
she
knew
all
at
once
that
she
was
fondly
loved
by
that
one
man
whom
she
had
chosen
for
her
idol
and
her
hero
what
matter
that
he
was
fortuneless
a
nobody
with
but
the
poorest
chances
of
success
in
the
world
what
if
he
must
needs
only
to
win
the
bare
means
of
existence
go
to
australia
and
keep
sheep
or
to
the
bed
river
valley
and
grow
corn
what
if
he
must
labour
as
the
peasants
laboured
on
the
sides
of
this
rude
hill
gladly
would
she
go
with
him
to
a
strange
country
and
keep
his
log
cabin
and
work
for
him
and
share
his
toilsome
life
rough
or
smooth
no
loss
of
social
rank
could
lessen
her
pride
in
him
her
belief
in
him
they
were
standing
side
by
side
a
little
way
from
the
edge
of
the
sheer
descent
below
which
the
bed
tarn
showed
black
in
a
basin
scooped
out
of
the
naked
hill
like
water
held
in
the
hollow
of
a
giant
hand
cried
mary
pointing
downward
must
see
the
red
tarn
the
highest
water
in
england
but
just
at
this
moment
there
came
a
blast
which
shook
even
strong
frame
and
with
a
cry
of
fear
he
snatched
mary
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
away
from
the
edge
of
the
hill
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
there
thirty
yards
away
from
the
precipice
safely
sheltered
against
his
breast
while
the
wind
raved
round
them
blowing
her
hair
from
the
broad
white
brow
and
showing
him
that
noble
forehead
in
all
its
power
and
beauty
while
the
darkness
deepened
round
them
so
that
they
could
see
hardly
anything
except
each
other
eyes
love
my
own
dear
love
he
murmured
fondly
will
trust
you
with
my
life
will
you
accept
the
trust
i
am
hardly
worthy
for
less
than
a
year
ago
i
offered
myself
to
your
sister
and
i
thought
she
was
the
only
woman
in
this
wide
world
who
could
make
me
happy
and
when
she
refused
me
i
was
in
despair
mary
and
i
left
fellside
in
the
full
belief
that
i
had
done
with
life
and
happiness
and
then
i
came
back
only
to
oblige
maulevrier
and
determined
to
be
utterly
miserable
at
fellside
i
was
miserable
for
the
first
two
hours
memories
of
dead
and
gone
joys
and
disappointed
hopes
were
very
bitter
and
i
tried
honestly
to
keep
up
my
feeling
of
wretchedness
for
the
first
few
days
but
it
was
no
use
molly
there
was
a
genial
spirit
in
the
place
a
laughing
fairy
who
would
not
let
me
be
sad
and
i
found
myself
becoming
most
unromantically
happy
eating
my
breakfast
with
a
hearty
appetite
thinking
my
cup
of
afternoon
tea
nectar
for
love
of
the
dear
hand
that
gave
it
and
so
and
so
till
the
new
love
the
purer
and
better
love
grew
and
grew
into
a
mighty
tree
which
was
as
an
oak
to
an
orchid
compared
with
that
passion
flower
of
earlier
growth
mary
will
you
trust
your
life
to
me
as
i
trust
mine
to
you
i
say
to
you
almost
in
the
words
i
spoke
last
year
to
lesbia
and
here
his
tone
grew
grave
almost
to
solemnity
me
and
i
will
make
your
life
free
from
the
shadow
of
care
trust
me
for
i
have
a
brave
spirit
and
a
strong
arm
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
trust
me
and
i
will
win
for
you
the
position
you
have
a
right
to
occupy
trust
me
and
you
shall
never
repent
your
trust
she
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
which
told
of
infinite
faith
unquestioning
faith
will
trust
you
in
all
things
and
for
ever
she
said
am
not
afraid
to
face
evil
fortune
i
do
not
care
how
poor
you
are
how
hard
our
lives
may
be
if
if
you
are
sure
you
love
me
there
is
not
a
beat
of
my
heart
or
a
thought
of
my
mind
that
does
not
belong
to
you
i
am
yours
to
the
very
depths
of
my
soul
my
innocent
love
my
angel
i
have
studied
you
and
watched
you
and
thought
of
you
and
sounded
the
depths
of
your
lovely
nature
and
the
result
is
that
you
are
for
me
earth
one
woman
i
will
have
no
other
mary
no
other
love
no
other
wife
maulevrier
will
be
dreadfully
angry
faltered
mary
you
afraid
of
her
anger
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
for
your
sake
he
lifted
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
reverently
and
there
was
a
touch
of
chivalry
in
that
reverential
kiss
his
eyes
clouded
with
tears
as
he
looked
down
into
the
trustful
face
the
fog
had
darkened
to
a
denser
blackness
and
it
was
almost
as
if
they
were
engulfed
in
sudden
night
we
are
never
to
find
our
way
down
the
hill
if
this
were
to
be
the
last
hour
of
our
lives
mary
would
you
be
content
content
she
answered
simply
think
i
have
lived
long
enough
if
you
really
love
me
if
you
are
not
making
fun
molly
do
you
still
doubt
is
it
strange
that
i
love
you
strange
i
am
so
different
from
lesbia
very
different
and
the
difference
is
your
highest
charm
and
now
love
we
had
better
go
down
whichever
side
of
the
hill
is
easiest
for
this
fog
is
rather
appalling
i
forgive
the
wind
because
it
blew
you
against
my
heart
just
now
and
that
is
where
i
want
you
to
dwell
for
ever
be
frightened
said
mary
know
every
step
of
the
way
so
leaning
on
her
lover
and
yet
guiding
him
slowly
step
by
step
groping
their
way
through
the
darkness
lady
mary
led
hammond
down
the
winding
track
along
which
the
ponies
and
the
guides
travel
so
often
in
the
summer
season
and
soon
they
began
to
descend
out
of
that
canopy
of
fog
which
enveloped
the
brow
of
helvellyn
and
to
see
the
whole
world
smiling
beneath
them
a
world
of
green
pastures
and
sheepfolds
with
a
white
homestead
here
and
there
amidst
the
fields
looking
so
human
and
so
comfortable
after
that
gloomy
mountain
top
round
which
the
tempest
howled
so
outrageously
beyond
those
pastures
stretched
the
dark
waters
of
thirlmere
looking
like
a
broad
river
the
descent
was
passing
steep
but
hammond
strong
arm
and
steady
steps
made
mary
progress
very
easy
while
she
had
in
no
wise
exaggerated
her
familiarity
with
the
windings
and
twistings
of
the
track
yet
as
they
had
need
to
travel
very
slowly
so
long
as
the
fog
still
surrounded
them
the
journey
downward
lasted
a
considerable
time
and
it
was
past
five
when
they
arrived
at
the
little
roadside
inn
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
here
hammond
insisted
that
mary
should
rest
at
least
long
enough
to
take
a
cup
of
tea
she
was
very
white
and
tired
she
had
been
profoundly
agitated
and
looked
on
the
point
of
fainting
although
she
protested
that
she
was
quite
ready
to
walk
on
are
not
going
to
walk
another
step
said
hammond
you
are
taking
your
tea
i
will
get
you
a
carriage
i
had
rather
hurry
on
at
once
urged
mary
are
so
late
already
will
get
home
all
the
sooner
if
you
obey
me
it
is
your
duty
to
obey
me
now
said
hammond
in
a
lowered
voice
she
smiled
at
him
but
it
was
a
weak
wan
little
smile
for
that
descent
in
the
wind
and
the
fog
had
quite
exhausted
her
hammond
took
her
into
a
snug
little
parlour
where
there
was
a
cheerful
fire
and
saw
her
comfortably
seated
in
an
arm
chair
by
the
hearth
before
he
went
to
look
after
a
carriage
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
conveyance
to
be
had
but
the
windermere
coach
would
pass
in
about
half
an
hour
and
for
this
they
must
wait
it
would
take
them
back
to
grasmere
sooner
than
they
could
get
there
on
foot
in
mary
exhausted
condition
the
was
brought
in
presently
and
hammond
poured
out
the
tea
and
waited
upon
lady
mary
it
was
a
reversal
of
the
usual
formula
but
it
was
very
pleasant
to
mary
to
sit
with
her
feet
on
the
low
brass
fender
and
be
waited
upon
by
her
lover
that
fog
on
the
brow
of
helvellyn
that
piercing
wind
had
chilled
her
to
the
bone
and
there
was
unspeakable
comfort
in
the
glow
and
warmth
of
the
fire
in
the
refreshment
of
a
good
cup
of
tea
you
are
my
own
property
now
remember
said
hammond
watching
her
tenderly
as
she
sipped
her
tea
she
glanced
up
at
him
shyly
now
and
then
with
eyes
full
of
innocent
wonder
it
was
so
strange
to
her
as
strange
as
sweet
to
know
that
he
loved
her
such
a
marvellous
thing
that
she
had
pledged
herself
to
be
his
wife
are
my
very
own
mine
to
guard
and
cherish
mine
to
think
and
work
for
he
went
on
you
will
have
to
trust
me
sweet
one
even
if
the
beginning
of
things
is
not
altogether
free
from
trouble
am
not
afraid
of
trouble
spoken
first
and
foremost
then
you
will
have
to
announce
your
engagement
to
lady
maulevrier
she
will
take
it
ill
no
doubt
will
do
her
utmost
to
persuade
you
to
give
me
up
have
you
courage
and
resolution
do
you
think
to
stand
against
her
arguments
can
you
hold
to
your
purpose
bravely
and
cry
no
surrender
shall
be
no
surrender
answered
mary
promise
you
that
no
doubt
grandmother
will
be
very
angry
but
she
has
never
cared
for
me
very
much
it
will
not
hurt
her
for
me
to
make
a
bad
match
as
it
would
have
done
in
lesbia
case
she
has
had
no
no
grand
ambition
about
me
much
the
better
my
wayside
flower
when
you
have
said
all
that
is
sweet
and
dutiful
to
her
and
have
let
her
know
at
the
same
time
that
you
mean
to
be
my
wife
come
weal
come
woe
i
will
see
her
and
will
have
my
say
i
will
not
promise
her
a
grand
career
for
my
darling
but
i
will
pledge
myself
that
nothing
of
that
kind
which
the
world
calls
evil
no
penury
or
shabbiness
of
surroundings
shall
ever
touch
mary
haselden
after
she
is
mary
hammond
i
can
promise
at
least
so
much
as
that
is
more
than
enough
said
mary
have
told
you
that
i
would
gladly
share
poverty
with
you
it
is
good
of
you
to
say
as
much
but
i
would
not
take
you
at
your
word
you
do
know
what
poverty
is
you
think
i
am
a
coward
or
you
are
wrong
jack
may
i
call
you
jack
as
maulevrier
does
you
the
question
evoked
such
a
gush
of
tenderness
that
he
was
fain
to
kneel
beside
her
chair
and
kiss
the
little
hand
holding
the
cup
before
he
considered
he
had
answered
properly
are
wrong
jack
i
do
know
what
poverty
means
i
have
studied
the
ways
of
the
poor
tried
to
console
them
and
help
them
a
little
in
their
troubles
and
i
know
there
is
no
pain
that
want
of
money
can
bring
which
i
would
not
share
willingly
with
you
do
you
suppose
my
happiness
is
dependent
on
a
fine
house
and
powdered
footmen
i
should
like
to
go
to
the
red
river
with
you
and
wear
cotton
gowns
and
tuck
up
my
sleeves
and
clean
our
cottage
pretty
sport
dear
for
a
summer
day
but
my
mary
shall
have
a
sweeter
life
and
shall
occasionally
walk
in
silk
attire
that
by
the
fireside
in
the
inn
parlour
was
the
most
delicious
thing
within
john
hammond
experience
mary
was
a
bewitching
compound
of
earnestness
and
simplicity
so
humble
so
confiding
so
perplexed
and
astounded
at
her
own
bliss
now
in
the
summer
when
you
were
in
love
with
lesbia
you
thought
me
a
horrid
kind
of
girl
she
said
presently
when
they
were
standing
side
by
side
at
the
window
waiting
for
the
coach
mary
my
crime
is
to
have
thought
very
little
about
you
in
those
days
i
was
so
dazzled
by
lesbia
beauty
so
charmed
by
her
accomplishments
and
girlish
graces
that
i
forgot
to
take
notice
of
anything
else
in
the
world
if
i
thought
of
you
at
all
it
was
as
another
maulevrier
a
younger
maulevrier
in
petticoats
very
gay
and
and
nice
when
you
saw
me
rushing
about
with
the
terriers
i
must
have
seemed
utterly
horrid
dearest
there
is
nothing
essentially
horrible
in
terriers
or
in
a
bright
lively
girl
running
races
with
them
you
made
a
very
pretty
picture
in
the
sunlight
with
your
hat
hanging
on
your
shoulder
and
your
curly
brown
hair
and
dancing
hazel
eyes
if
i
had
not
been
deep
in
love
with
lesbia
peerless
complexion
and
grecian
features
i
should
have
looked
below
the
surface
of
that
gainsborough
picture
and
discovered
what
treasures
of
goodness
and
courage
and
truth
and
purity
those
frank
brown
eyes
and
that
wide
forehead
betokened
i
was
sowing
my
wild
oats
last
summer
mary
and
they
brought
me
a
crop
of
sorrow
but
i
am
wiser
now
wiser
and
happier
if
you
were
to
see
lesbia
again
would
not
the
old
love
revive
old
love
is
dead
mary
there
is
nothing
left
of
it
but
a
handful
of
ashes
which
i
scatter
thus
to
the
four
winds
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
towards
the
open
casement
new
love
absorbs
and
masters
my
being
if
lesbia
were
to
at
fellside
this
evening
i
could
offer
her
my
hand
in
all
brotherly
frankness
and
ask
her
to
accept
me
as
a
brother
here
comes
the
coach
we
shall
be
at
fellside
just
in
time
for
dinner
chapter
xxii
wiser
than
lesbia
lady
mary
and
hammond
were
back
at
fellside
at
a
quarter
before
eight
by
which
time
the
stars
were
shining
on
pine
woods
and
fell
they
managed
to
be
in
the
when
dinner
was
announced
after
the
hastiest
of
toilets
yet
her
lover
thought
mary
had
never
looked
prettier
than
she
looked
that
night
in
her
limp
white
cashmere
gown
and
with
her
brown
hair
brushed
into
a
large
loose
knot
on
the
top
of
her
head
there
had
been
great
uneasiness
about
them
at
fellside
when
evening
began
to
draw
in
and
the
expected
hour
of
their
return
had
gone
by
scouts
had
been
sent
in
quest
of
them
but
in
the
wrong
direction
did
not
think
you
would
be
such
idiots
as
to
come
down
the
north
side
of
the
hill
in
a
tempest
said
maulevrier
could
see
the
clouds
racing
over
the
crest
of
seat
sandal
and
knew
it
was
blowing
pretty
hard
up
there
though
it
was
calm
enough
down
here
pretty
hard
echoed
hammond
do
think
i
was
ever
out
in
a
worse
gale
and
yet
i
have
been
across
the
bay
of
biscay
when
the
waves
struck
the
side
of
the
steamer
like
battering
rams
and
when
the
whole
surface
of
the
sea
was
white
with
seething
foam
was
a
most
imprudent
thing
to
go
up
helvellyn
in
such
weather
said
fräulein
müller
shaking
her
head
gloomily
as
she
ate
her
fish
mary
felt
that
the
fräulein
manner
boded
ill
there
was
a
storm
brewing
a
scolding
was
inevitable
mary
felt
quite
capable
of
doing
battle
with
the
fräulein
but
her
feelings
were
altogether
different
when
she
thought
of
facing
that
stern
old
lady
upstairs
and
of
the
confession
she
had
to
make
it
was
not
that
her
courage
faltered
so
far
as
resolutions
went
she
was
as
firm
as
a
rock
but
she
felt
that
there
was
a
terrible
ordeal
to
be
gone
through
and
it
seemed
a
mockery
to
be
sitting
there
and
pretending
to
eat
her
dinner
and
take
things
lightly
with
that
ordeal
before
her
did
not
go
up
the
hill
in
bad
weather
miss
müller
said
hammond
sun
was
shining
and
the
sky
was
blue
when
we
started
we
could
not
foresee
darkness
and
storm
at
the
top
of
the
hill
that
was
the
fortune
of
war
am
very
sorry
lady
mary
had
not
more
good
sense
replied
fräulein
with
unabated
gloom
but
on
this
maulevrier
took
up
the
cudgels
there
was
any
want
of
sense
in
the
business
that
my
fräulein
he
said
glaring
angrily
at
the
governess
was
i
who
advised
hammond
and
lady
mary
to
climb
the
hill
and
here
they
are
safe
and
sound
after
their
journey
i
see
no
reason
why
there
should
be
any
fuss
about
it
have
different
ways
of
looking
at
things
replied
fräulein
plodding
steadily
on
with
her
dinner
mary
rose
directly
the
dessert
had
been
handed
round
and
marched
out
of
the
room
like
a
warrior
going
to
a
battle
in
which
the
chances
of
defeat
were
strong
fräulein
müller
shuffled
after
her
you
be
kind
enough
to
go
to
her
ladyship
room
at
once
lady
mary
she
said
wants
to
speak
to
you
i
want
to
speak
to
her
said
mary
she
ran
quickly
upstairs
and
arrived
in
the
morning
room
a
little
out
of
breath
the
room
was
lighted
by
one
low
moderator
lamp
under
a
dark
red
velvet
shade
and
there
was
the
glow
of
the
wood
fire
which
gave
a
more
cheerful
light
than
the
lamp
lady
maulevrier
was
lying
on
her
couch
in
a
loose
brocade
with
old
brussels
collar
and
ruffles
she
was
as
well
dressed
in
her
day
of
affliction
and
helplessness
as
she
had
been
in
her
day
of
strength
for
she
knew
the
value
of
surroundings
and
that
her
stateliness
and
power
were
in
some
manner
dependent
on
details
of
this
kind
the
one
hand
which
she
could
use
glittered
with
diamonds
as
she
waved
it
with
a
little
imperious
gesture
towards
the
chair
on
which
she
desired
lady
mary
to
seat
herself
and
mary
sat
down
meekly
knowing
that
this
chair
represented
the
felon
dock
began
her
grandmother
with
freezing
gravity
have
been
surprised
and
shocked
by
your
conduct
yes
surprised
at
such
conduct
even
in
you
do
not
think
i
have
done
anything
very
wrong
grandmother
wrong
you
have
done
nothing
wrong
you
have
done
something
absolutely
outrageous
you
my
granddaughter
well
born
well
bred
reared
under
my
roof
to
go
up
helvellyn
and
lose
yourself
in
a
fog
alone
with
a
young
man
you
could
hardly
have
done
worse
if
you
were
a
cockney
tourist
concluded
her
ladyship
with
ineffable
disgust
could
not
help
the
fog
said
mary
quietly
the
battle
had
to
be
fought
and
she
was
not
going
to
flinch
had
no
intention
of
going
up
helvellyn
alone
with
hammond
maulevrier
was
to
have
gone
with
us
but
when
we
got
to
dolly
waggon
he
was
tired
and
would
not
go
any
further
he
told
me
to
go
on
with
mr
hammond
told
you
maulevrier
a
young
man
who
has
spent
some
of
the
best
hours
of
his
youth
in
the
company
of
jockeys
and
trainers
who
the
faintest
idea
of
the
fitness
of
things
you
allow
maulevrier
to
be
your
guide
in
a
matter
in
which
your
own
instinct
should
have
guided
you
your
womanly
instinct
but
you
have
always
been
an
unwomanly
girl
you
have
put
me
to
shame
many
a
time
by
your
hoydenish
tricks
but
i
bore
with
you
believing
that
your
madcap
follies
were
at
least
harmless
you
have
gone
a
step
too
far
and
have
been
guilty
of
absolute
impropriety
which
i
shall
be
very
slow
to
pardon
you
will
be
still
more
angry
when
you
know
all
grandmother
said
mary
lady
maulevrier
flashed
her
dark
eyes
at
the
girl
with
a
look
which
would
have
almost
killed
a
nervous
subject
but
mary
faced
her
steadfastly
very
pale
but
as
resolute
as
her
ladyship
i
know
all
what
more
is
there
for
me
to
know
that
while
we
were
on
the
top
of
helvellyn
in
the
fog
and
the
wind
hammond
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
am
not
surprised
to
hear
it
retorted
her
ladyship
with
a
harsh
laugh
girl
who
could
act
so
boldly
and
flirtingly
was
a
natural
mark
for
an
adventurer
hammond
no
doubt
has
been
told
that
you
will
have
a
little
money
and
thinks
he
might
do
worse
than
marry
you
and
seeing
how
you
have
flung
yourself
at
his
head
he
naturally
concludes
that
you
will
not
be
too
proud
to
accept
your
leavings
is
nothing
gained
by
making
cruel
speeches
grandmother
said
mary
firmly
have
promised
to
be
john
hammond
wife
and
there
is
nothing
you
nor
anyone
else
can
say
which
will
make
me
alter
my
mind
i
wish
to
act
dutifully
to
you
if
i
can
and
i
hope
you
will
be
good
to
me
and
consent
to
this
marriage
but
if
you
will
not
consent
i
shall
marry
him
all
the
same
i
shall
be
full
of
sorrow
at
having
to
disobey
you
but
i
have
promised
and
i
will
keep
my
promise
will
act
in
open
rebellion
against
me
against
the
kinswoman
who
has
reared
you
and
educated
you
and
cared
for
you
in
all
these
years
you
have
never
loved
me
answered
mary
sadly
if
you
had
given
me
some
portion
of
that
affection
which
you
lavished
on
my
sister
i
might
be
willing
to
sacrifice
this
new
deep
love
for
your
sake
to
lay
down
my
broken
heart
as
a
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
gratitude
but
you
never
loved
me
you
have
tolerated
me
endured
my
presence
as
a
disagreeable
necessity
of
your
life
because
i
am
my
father
daughter
you
and
lesbia
have
been
all
the
world
to
each
other
and
i
have
stood
aloof
outside
your
charmed
circle
almost
a
stranger
to
you
can
you
wonder
grandmother
recalling
this
that
i
am
unwilling
to
surrender
the
love
that
has
been
given
me
the
true
heart
of
a
brave
and
good
man
lady
maulevrier
looked
at
her
for
some
moments
in
scornful
wonderment
looked
at
her
with
a
slow
deliberate
smile
child
she
said
ignorant
inexperienced
baby
for
what
a
are
you
ready
to
sacrifice
my
regard
and
all
the
privileges
of
your
position
as
my
granddaughter
no
doubt
this
hammond
has
said
all
manner
of
fine
things
to
you
but
can
you
be
weak
enough
to
believe
that
he
who
half
a
year
ago
was
sighing
and
dying
at
the
feet
of
your
sister
can
have
one
spark
of
genuine
regard
for
you
the
thing
is
not
in
nature
it
is
an
obvious
absurdity
but
it
is
easy
enough
to
understand
that
hammond
without
a
penny
in
his
pocket
and
with
his
way
to
make
in
the
world
would
be
very
glad
to
secure
lady
mary
haselden
and
her
five
hundred
a
year
and
to
have
lord
maulevrier
for
his
brother
i
really
five
hundred
a
year
shall
i
have
five
hundred
a
year
when
i
marry
asked
mary
suddenly
radiant
if
you
marry
with
your
brother
consent
am
so
glad
for
his
sake
he
could
hardly
starve
if
i
had
five
hundred
a
year
he
need
not
be
obliged
to
emigrate
he
been
offering
you
the
prospect
of
emigration
as
an
additional
inducement
no
he
does
not
say
that
he
is
very
poor
but
since
you
say
he
is
penniless
i
thought
we
might
be
obliged
to
emigrate
but
as
i
have
five
hundred
a
year
will
stay
at
home
and
set
up
a
i
suppose
sneered
lady
maulevrier
will
do
anything
my
husband
pleases
we
can
live
in
a
humble
way
in
some
quiet
part
of
london
while
hammond
works
at
literature
or
politics
i
am
not
afraid
of
poverty
or
trouble
i
am
willing
to
endure
both
for
his
sake
are
a
fool
said
her
grandmother
sternly
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
go
away
and
send
maulevrier
to
me
mary
did
not
obey
immediately
she
went
over
to
her
grandmother
couch
and
knelt
by
her
side
and
kissed
the
poor
maimed
hand
which
lay
on
the
velvet
cushion
grandmother
she
said
gently
am
very
sorry
to
rebel
against
you
but
this
is
a
question
of
life
or
death
with
me
i
am
not
like
lesbia
i
can
not
barter
love
and
truth
for
worldly
advantage
for
pride
of
race
do
not
think
me
so
weak
or
so
vain
as
to
be
won
by
a
few
fine
speeches
from
an
adventurer
hammond
is
no
adventurer
he
has
made
no
fine
speeches
but
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
grandmother
i
have
liked
and
admired
him
from
the
first
time
he
came
here
i
have
looked
up
to
him
and
reverenced
him
and
i
must
be
a
very
foolish
girl
if
my
judgment
is
so
poor
that
i
can
respect
a
worthless
man
a
very
foolish
girl
answered
lady
maulevrier
more
kindly
than
she
had
spoken
before
you
have
been
very
good
and
dutiful
to
me
since
i
have
been
ill
and
i
do
wish
to
forget
that
i
never
said
that
hammond
was
worthless
but
i
say
that
he
is
no
fit
husband
for
you
if
you
were
as
yielding
and
obedient
as
lesbia
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
you
for
then
i
should
provide
for
your
establishment
in
life
in
a
becoming
manner
but
as
you
are
wilful
and
bent
upon
taking
your
own
way
well
my
dear
you
must
take
the
consequence
and
when
you
are
a
struggling
wife
and
mother
old
before
your
time
weighed
down
with
the
weary
burden
of
petty
cares
do
not
say
my
grandmother
might
have
saved
me
from
this
martyrdom
will
run
the
risk
grandmother
i
will
be
answerable
for
my
own
fate
be
it
mary
and
now
send
maulevrier
to
me
mary
went
down
to
the
billiard
room
where
she
found
her
brother
and
her
lover
engaged
in
a
hundred
game
my
cue
and
beat
him
if
you
can
molly
said
maulevrier
when
he
had
heard
mary
message
fifteen
ahead
of
him
for
he
has
been
falling
asleep
over
his
shots
i
suppose
i
am
going
to
get
a
lecture
do
think
so
said
mary
my
dearest
how
did
you
fare
in
the
encounter
asked
hammond
directly
maulevrier
was
gone
it
was
dreadful
i
made
the
most
rebellious
speeches
to
poor
grandmother
and
then
i
remembered
her
affliction
and
i
asked
her
to
forgive
me
and
just
at
the
last
she
was
ever
so
much
kinder
and
i
think
that
she
will
let
me
marry
you
now
she
knows
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
be
your
wife
in
spite
of
fate
bravest
and
best
do
you
know
jack
she
blushed
tremendously
as
she
uttered
this
familiar
name
have
made
a
discovery
find
that
i
am
to
have
five
hundred
a
year
when
i
am
married
it
is
not
much
but
i
suppose
it
will
help
wo
it
we
ca
exactly
starve
if
we
have
five
hundred
a
year
let
me
see
it
is
more
than
a
pound
a
day
a
sovereign
ought
to
go
a
long
way
in
a
small
house
and
of
course
we
shall
begin
in
a
very
wee
house
like
de
quincey
cottage
over
there
only
in
london
dear
there
are
plenty
of
such
cottages
in
london
in
mayfair
for
instance
or
belgravia
you
are
laughing
at
my
rustic
ignorance
but
the
five
hundred
pounds
will
be
a
help
wo
it
dear
a
great
help
so
glad
she
had
chalked
her
cue
while
she
was
talking
but
after
taking
her
aim
she
dropped
her
arm
irresolutely
you
know
i
afraid
i
ca
play
she
said
and
the
fog
and
the
wind
have
quite
spoilt
my
nerve
shall
we
go
to
the
and
see
if
fräulein
has
recovered
from
her
gloomy
fit
would
rather
stay
here
where
we
are
free
to
talk
but
i
do
whatever
you
like
best
mary
preferred
the
it
was
very
sweet
to
be
alone
with
her
lover
but
she
was
weighed
down
with
confusion
in
his
presence
the
novelty
the
wonderment
of
her
position
overpowered
her
she
yearned
for
the
shelter
of
fräulein
müller
wing
albeit
the
company
of
that
most
prosaic
person
was
certain
death
to
romance
miss
müller
was
in
her
accustomed
seat
by
the
fire
knitting
her
customary
muffler
she
had
appropriated
lady
maulevrier
place
much
to
mary
disgust
it
irked
the
girl
to
see
that
stout
clumsy
figure
in
the
chair
which
had
been
filled
by
her
grandmother
imperial
form
the
very
room
seemed
vulgarised
by
the
change
fräulein
looked
up
with
a
surprised
air
when
mary
and
hammond
entered
together
the
girl
smiling
and
happy
she
had
expected
that
mary
would
have
left
her
ladyship
room
in
tears
and
would
have
retired
to
her
own
apartment
to
hide
her
swollen
eyelids
and
humiliated
aspect
but
here
she
was
after
the
fiery
ordeal
of
an
interview
with
her
offended
grandmother
not
in
the
least
crestfallen
we
not
to
have
any
tea
asked
mary
looking
round
the
room
think
you
are
unconscious
of
the
progress
of
time
lady
mary
answered
fräulein
stiffly
tea
has
been
brought
in
and
taken
out
again
it
must
be
brought
again
if
lady
mary
wants
some
said
hammond
ringing
the
bell
in
the
coolest
manner
fräulein
felt
that
things
were
coming
to
a
pretty
pass
if
humble
friend
was
going
to
give
orders
in
the
house
quiet
and
commonplace
as
the
hanoverian
was
she
had
her
ambition
and
that
was
to
grasp
the
household
sceptre
which
lady
maulevrier
must
needs
in
some
wise
resign
now
that
she
was
a
prisoner
to
her
rooms
but
so
far
fräulein
had
met
with
but
small
success
in
this
endeavour
her
ladyship
authority
still
ruled
the
house
her
ladyship
keen
intellect
took
cognisance
even
of
trifles
and
it
was
only
in
the
most
insignificant
details
that
fräulein
felt
herself
a
power
your
ladyship
what
the
row
said
maulevrier
marching
into
his
grandmother
room
with
a
free
and
easy
air
he
was
prepared
for
a
skirmish
and
he
meant
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
suppose
you
know
what
has
happened
said
her
ladyship
and
hammond
expedition
yes
of
course
i
went
part
of
the
way
with
them
but
i
was
out
of
training
got
pumped
out
after
a
couple
of
miles
and
was
such
a
fool
as
to
go
to
the
top
you
know
that
hammond
made
mary
an
offer
while
they
were
on
the
hill
and
that
she
accepted
him
queer
place
for
a
proposal
was
it
the
wind
blowing
great
guns
all
the
time
i
should
have
chosen
a
more
tranquil
spot
can
not
you
be
serious
do
you
forget
that
this
business
of
must
affect
your
sister
welfare
for
the
rest
of
her
life
i
do
not
i
will
be
as
serious
as
a
judge
after
he
has
put
on
the
black
cap
said
maulevrier
seating
himself
near
his
couch
and
altering
his
tone
altogether
i
am
very
glad
that
hammond
has
asked
mary
to
be
his
wife
and
still
more
glad
that
she
is
tremendously
in
love
with
him
i
told
you
some
time
ago
not
to
put
your
spoke
in
that
wheel
there
could
not
be
a
happier
or
a
better
marriage
for
mary
must
have
rather
a
poor
opinion
of
your
sister
attractions
personal
or
otherwise
if
you
consider
a
penniless
young
man
of
no
family
good
enough
for
her
do
not
consider
my
sister
a
piece
of
merchandise
to
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
granted
that
hammond
is
poor
and
a
nobody
he
is
an
honourable
man
highly
gifted
brave
as
a
lion
and
he
is
my
dearest
friend
can
you
wonder
that
i
rejoice
at
my
sister
having
won
him
for
her
adoring
lover
he
really
care
for
her
after
having
loved
lesbia
was
the
desire
of
the
eye
this
is
the
love
of
the
heart
i
know
that
he
loves
mary
ever
so
much
better
than
he
loved
lesbia
i
can
assure
your
ladyship
that
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
i
look
i
am
very
fond
of
my
sister
mary
and
i
have
not
been
blind
to
her
interests
i
tell
you
on
my
honour
that
she
ought
to
be
very
happy
as
john
wife
am
obliged
to
believe
what
you
say
about
his
character
said
lady
maulevrier
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
the
husband
character
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
wife
happiness
from
a
moral
point
of
view
but
still
there
are
material
questions
to
be
considered
has
your
friend
any
means
of
supporting
a
wife
he
has
means
quite
sufficient
means
for
mary
views
which
are
very
simple
mean
to
say
he
would
keep
her
in
decent
poverty
can
not
you
be
explicit
maulevrier
and
say
what
means
the
man
has
whether
an
income
or
none
if
you
can
not
tell
me
i
must
question
hammond
himself
do
not
do
that
exclaimed
her
grandson
urgently
not
take
all
the
flavour
of
romance
out
of
molly
love
story
by
going
into
pounds
shillings
and
pence
she
is
very
young
you
would
hardly
wish
her
to
marry
immediately
for
the
next
year
at
the
very
least
why
enter
upon
this
sordid
question
of
ways
and
means
make
hammond
and
mary
happy
by
consenting
to
their
engagement
and
trust
the
rest
to
providence
and
to
me
take
my
word
for
it
hammond
is
not
a
beggar
and
he
is
a
man
likely
to
make
his
mark
in
the
world
if
a
year
hence
his
income
is
not
enough
to
allow
of
his
marrying
i
will
double
mary
allowance
out
of
my
own
purse
hammond
friendship
has
steadied
me
and
saved
me
a
good
deal
more
than
five
hundred
a
year
can
quite
believe
that
i
believe
hammond
is
a
worthy
man
and
that
his
influence
has
been
very
good
for
you
but
that
does
not
make
him
a
good
match
for
mary
however
you
seem
to
have
settled
the
business
among
you
and
i
suppose
i
must
submit
you
had
better
all
drink
tea
with
me
to
morrow
afternoon
and
i
will
receive
your
friend
as
mary
future
husband
is
the
best
and
kindest
of
grandmothers
i
should
like
to
know
more
of
his
antecedents
and
his
relations
antecedents
are
altogether
creditable
he
took
honours
at
the
university
he
has
been
liked
and
respected
everywhere
he
is
an
orphan
and
it
is
better
not
to
talk
to
him
of
his
family
he
is
sensitive
on
that
point
like
most
men
who
stand
alone
in
the
world
i
will
hold
my
peace
you
have
taken
this
business
into
your
hands
maulevrier
and
you
must
be
responsible
for
the
result
maulevrier
left
his
grandmother
soon
after
this
and
went
downstairs
whistling
for
very
joyousness
finding
the
deserted
he
repaired
to
the
where
he
found
mary
playing
scraps
of
melody
to
her
lover
at
the
shadowy
end
of
the
room
while
fräulein
sat
by
the
fire
weaving
her
web
as
steadily
as
one
of
the
fatal
sisters
and
with
a
brow
prophetic
of
evil
maulevrier
crept
up
to
the
piano
and
came
stealthily
behind
the
lovers
you
my
children
he
said
hovering
over
them
with
outspread
hands
am
the
dove
coming
back
to
the
ark
i
am
the
bearer
of
happy
tidings
lady
maulevrier
consents
to
your
acquiring
the
legal
right
to
make
each
other
miserable
for
the
rest
of
your
lives
bless
you
maulevrier
said
hammond
clasping
him
by
the
hand
as
this
sister
of
mine
is
hardly
out
of
the
nursery
you
will
have
to
wait
for
her
at
least
a
year
so
says
the
dowager
whose
word
is
like
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
and
altereth
not
would
wait
for
her
twice
seven
years
as
jacob
waited
and
toil
for
her
as
jacob
toiled
answered
hammond
i
should
like
to
call
her
my
own
if
it
were
possible
nothing
could
be
happier
or
gayer
than
the
in
lady
maulevrier
room
on
the
following
afternoon
her
ladyship
having
once
given
way
upon
a
point
knew
how
to
make
her
concession
gracefully
she
extended
her
hand
to
hammond
as
frankly
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
particular
choice
can
not
refuse
my
granddaughter
to
her
brother
dearest
friend
she
said
i
think
you
are
two
most
imprudent
young
people
takes
care
of
imprudent
lovers
just
as
it
does
of
the
birds
in
their
nests
answered
hammond
smiling
as
much
and
no
more
i
fear
providence
does
not
keep
off
the
cat
or
the
must
take
care
of
their
nests
and
husbands
must
work
for
their
homes
argued
hammond
gives
sweet
air
and
sunlight
and
a
beautiful
world
to
live
in
think
said
lady
maulevrier
looking
at
him
critically
are
just
the
kind
of
person
who
ought
to
emigrate
you
have
ideas
that
would
do
for
the
bush
or
the
yosemite
valley
but
which
are
too
primitive
for
an
country
lady
maulevrier
i
am
not
going
to
steal
your
granddaughter
when
she
is
my
wife
she
shall
live
within
call
i
know
she
loves
her
native
land
and
i
do
think
either
of
us
would
care
to
put
an
ocean
between
us
and
rugged
old
helvellyn
course
having
made
idiots
of
yourselves
up
there
in
the
fog
and
the
storm
you
are
going
to
worship
the
mountain
for
ever
afterwards
said
her
ladyship
laughing
never
had
she
seemed
gayer
or
brighter
perhaps
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
rejoiced
at
getting
mary
engaged
even
to
so
humble
a
suitor
as
fortuneless
john
hammond
ever
since
the
visit
of
the
rajah
she
had
lived
as
damocles
lived
with
the
sword
of
destiny
the
avenging
sword
hanging
over
her
by
the
finest
hair
every
time
she
heard
carriage
wheels
in
the
drive
every
time
the
bell
rang
a
little
louder
than
usual
her
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
and
her
whole
being
to
hang
suspended
on
a
thread
if
the
thread
were
to
snap
there
would
come
darkness
and
death
the
blow
that
had
paralysed
one
side
of
her
body
must
needs
if
repeated
bring
total
extinction
she
who
believed
in
no
after
life
saw
in
her
maimed
and
wasting
arm
the
beginning
of
death
she
who
recognised
only
the
life
of
the
body
felt
that
one
half
of
her
was
already
dead
but
months
had
gone
by
and
louis
asoph
had
made
no
sign
she
began
to
hope
that
his
boasted
documents
and
witnesses
were
altogether
mythical
and
yet
the
engines
of
the
law
are
slow
to
put
in
motion
he
might
be
working
up
his
case
line
upon
line
with
some
london
lawyer
arranging
and
marshalling
his
facts
preparing
his
witnesses
waiting
for
affidavits
from
india
working
slowly
but
surely
underground
like
the
mole
and
all
at
once
in
an
hour
his
case
might
be
before
the
law
courts
his
story
and
the
story
of
lord
maulevrier
infamy
might
be
town
talk
again
as
it
had
been
forty
years
ago
when
the
true
story
of
that
crime
had
been
happily
unknown
yes
with
the
present
fear
of
this
louis
asoph
revelations
of
a
new
scandal
if
not
a
calamity
lady
maulevrier
felt
that
it
was
a
good
thing
to
have
her
younger
granddaughter
future
in
some
measure
secured
john
hammond
had
said
of
himself
to
lesbia
that
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
fail
and
looking
at
him
critically
lady
maulevrier
saw
the
stamp
of
power
and
dauntless
courage
in
his
countenance
and
bearing
it
is
the
inner
mind
of
a
man
which
moulds
the
lines
of
his
face
and
figure
and
a
man
character
may
be
read
in
the
way
he
walks
and
holds
himself
the
action
of
his
hand
his
smile
his
frown
his
general
outlook
as
clearly
as
in
any
phrenological
development
john
hammond
had
a
noble
outlook
bold
without
impudence
or
without
vanity
yes
assuredly
a
man
to
wrestle
with
difficulty
and
to
conquer
fate
when
that
little
was
over
and
maulevrier
and
his
friend
were
going
away
to
dress
for
dinner
lady
maulevrier
detained
mary
for
a
minute
or
two
by
her
couch
she
took
her
by
the
hand
with
unaccustomed
tenderness
child
i
congratulate
you
she
said
night
i
thought
you
a
fool
but
i
begin
to
think
that
you
are
wiser
than
lesbia
you
have
won
the
heart
of
a
noble
young
man
chapter
xxiii
young
lamb
heart
among
the
flocks
for
three
most
happy
days
mary
rejoiced
in
her
lover
society
maulevrier
was
with
them
everywhere
by
brookside
and
fell
on
the
lake
in
the
gardens
in
the
playing
propriety
with
admirable
patience
but
this
could
not
last
for
ever
a
man
who
has
to
win
name
and
fortune
and
a
home
for
his
young
wife
can
not
spend
all
his
days
in
the
primrose
path
fortunes
and
reputations
are
not
made
in
dawdling
beside
a
mountain
stream
or
watching
the
play
of
sunlight
and
shadow
on
a
green
unless
indeed
one
were
a
new
wordsworth
and
even
then
fortune
and
renown
are
not
quickly
made
and
again
maulevrier
who
had
been
a
marvel
of
and
contentment
for
the
last
eight
weeks
was
beginning
to
be
tired
of
this
lovely
lakeland
just
when
lakeland
was
daily
developing
into
new
beauty
maulevrier
began
to
feel
an
itching
for
london
where
he
had
a
comfortable
nest
in
the
albany
and
which
was
to
his
mind
a
metropolis
expressly
created
as
a
centre
or
starting
point
for
newmarket
epsom
ascot
and
goodwood
so
there
came
a
morning
upon
which
mary
had
to
say
to
those
two
companions
who
had
so
blest
and
gladdened
her
life
it
was
a
bright
sunshiny
morning
and
all
the
world
looked
gay
which
seemed
very
unkind
of
nature
mary
thought
and
yet
even
in
the
sadness
of
this
parting
she
had
much
reason
to
be
glad
as
she
stood
with
her
lover
in
the
library
in
the
three
minutes
of
stolen
from
the
fräulein
folded
in
his
arms
looking
up
at
his
manly
face
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
mere
knowledge
that
she
belonged
to
him
and
was
beloved
by
him
ought
to
sustain
and
console
her
even
in
long
years
of
severance
yes
even
if
he
were
one
of
the
knights
of
old
going
to
the
holy
land
on
a
crusade
full
of
peril
and
uncertainty
even
then
a
woman
ought
to
be
brave
having
such
a
lover
but
her
parting
was
to
be
only
for
a
few
months
maulevrier
promised
to
come
back
to
fellside
for
the
august
sports
and
hammond
was
to
come
with
him
three
months
or
a
little
more
and
they
were
to
meet
again
yet
in
spite
of
these
arguments
for
courage
mary
face
blanched
and
her
eyes
grew
unutterably
sad
as
she
looked
up
at
her
lover
will
take
care
of
yourself
jack
for
my
sake
wo
you
dear
she
murmured
you
should
be
ill
while
you
are
in
london
if
you
should
die
is
very
uncertain
love
but
i
do
feel
like
sickness
or
death
just
at
present
answered
hammond
cheerily
i
feel
that
the
present
is
full
of
sweetness
and
the
future
full
of
hope
suppose
dear
that
i
am
not
grieved
at
this
but
before
we
are
a
year
older
i
hope
the
time
will
have
come
when
there
will
be
no
more
farewells
for
you
and
me
i
shall
be
a
very
exacting
husband
molly
i
shall
want
to
spend
all
the
days
and
hours
of
my
life
with
you
to
have
not
a
fancy
or
a
pursuit
in
which
you
can
not
share
or
with
which
you
can
not
sympathise
i
hope
you
will
not
grow
tired
of
me
then
came
silence
and
a
long
farewell
kiss
and
then
the
voice
of
maulevrier
shouting
in
the
hall
just
in
time
to
warn
the
lovers
before
miss
müller
opened
the
door
and
exclaimed
hammond
we
have
been
looking
for
you
the
luggage
is
all
in
the
carriage
and
maulevrier
says
there
is
only
just
time
to
get
to
windermere
in
another
minute
or
so
the
carriage
was
driving
down
the
hill
and
mary
stood
in
the
porch
looking
after
the
travellers
seems
as
if
it
is
my
fate
to
stand
here
and
see
everybody
drive
away
she
said
to
herself
and
then
she
looked
round
at
the
lovely
gardens
bright
with
spring
flowers
the
trees
glorious
with
their
young
fresh
foliage
and
the
vast
panorama
of
hill
and
dale
and
felt
that
it
was
a
wicked
thing
to
murmur
in
the
midst
of
such
a
world
and
she
remembered
the
great
bliss
that
had
come
to
her
within
the
last
four
days
and
the
cloud
upon
her
brow
vanished
as
she
clasped
her
hands
in
joyousness
bless
you
dear
old
helvellyn
she
exclaimed
looking
up
at
the
sombre
crest
of
the
mountain
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
he
would
have
never
proposed
but
she
was
obliged
to
dismiss
this
idea
instantly
for
to
suppose
john
hammond
avowal
of
his
love
an
accident
the
mere
impulse
of
a
weak
moment
would
be
despair
had
he
not
told
her
how
she
had
grown
nearer
and
nearer
to
his
heart
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
until
she
had
become
part
of
his
life
he
had
told
her
this
he
in
whom
she
believed
as
in
the
very
spirit
of
truth
she
wandered
about
the
gardens
for
an
hour
after
the
carriage
had
started
for
windermere
revisiting
every
spot
where
she
and
her
lover
had
walked
together
within
the
last
three
days
living
over
again
the
rapture
of
those
hours
repeating
to
herself
his
words
recalling
his
looks
with
the
fatuity
of
a
first
girlish
love
and
yet
amidst
the
silliness
inseparable
from
love
young
dream
there
was
a
depth
of
true
womanly
feeling
thoughtful
unselfish
forecasting
a
future
which
was
not
to
travel
always
along
the
primrose
path
of
dalliance
a
future
in
which
the
roses
were
not
always
to
be
thornless
john
hammond
was
going
to
london
to
work
for
a
position
in
the
world
to
strive
and
labour
among
the
seething
mass
of
strugglers
all
pressing
onward
for
the
same
goal
independence
wealth
renown
little
as
mary
know
of
the
world
by
experience
she
had
at
least
heard
the
wiseacres
talk
and
that
which
she
had
heard
was
calculated
to
depress
rather
than
to
inspire
industrious
youth
she
had
heard
how
the
professions
were
all
how
a
mighty
army
of
young
men
were
walking
the
hospitals
all
intent
on
feeling
the
pulses
and
picking
the
pockets
of
the
rising
generation
how
at
the
bar
men
were
growing
old
and
grey
before
they
saw
their
first
brief
how
competitors
were
elbowing
and
hustling
each
other
upon
every
road
thronging
at
every
gate
and
while
masculine
youth
strove
and
wrestled
for
places
in
the
race
aunts
and
sisters
and
cousins
were
pressing
into
the
same
arena
doing
their
best
to
crowd
out
the
uncles
and
the
brothers
and
the
nephews
jack
sighed
mary
the
worst
we
can
go
to
the
red
river
country
and
grow
corn
this
was
her
favourite
fancy
that
she
and
her
lover
should
find
their
first
dwelling
in
the
new
world
live
as
humbly
as
the
peasants
lived
round
grasmere
and
patiently
wait
upon
fortune
and
yet
that
would
not
be
happiness
unless
maulevrier
were
to
come
and
stay
with
them
every
autumn
nothing
could
reconcile
mary
to
being
separated
from
maulevrier
for
any
lengthened
period
there
were
hours
in
which
she
was
more
hopeful
and
defied
the
wiseacres
clever
young
men
had
succeeded
in
the
past
clever
men
whose
hair
was
not
yet
grey
had
come
to
the
front
in
the
present
granted
that
these
were
the
exceptional
men
the
fine
flower
of
humanity
did
she
not
know
that
john
hammond
was
as
far
above
average
youth
as
helvellyn
was
above
yonder
mound
in
her
grandmother
shrubbery
yes
he
would
succeed
in
literature
in
politics
in
whatever
career
he
had
chosen
for
himself
he
was
a
man
to
do
the
thing
he
set
himself
to
do
were
it
ever
so
difficult
to
doubt
his
success
would
be
to
doubt
his
truth
and
his
honesty
for
he
had
sworn
to
her
he
would
make
her
life
bright
and
happy
and
that
evil
days
should
never
come
to
her
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
promise
that
which
he
was
not
able
to
perform
the
house
seemed
terribly
dull
now
that
the
two
young
men
were
gone
there
was
an
oppressive
silence
in
the
rooms
which
had
lately
resounded
with
maulevrier
frank
boyish
laughter
and
with
his
friend
deep
manly
tones
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
click
of
fräulein
needles
the
fräulein
was
not
disposed
to
be
sympathetic
or
agreeable
about
lady
mary
engagement
firstly
she
had
not
been
consulted
about
it
the
thing
had
been
done
she
considered
in
an
underhand
manner
and
lady
maulevrier
who
had
begun
by
strenuously
opposing
the
match
had
been
talked
over
in
a
way
that
proved
the
latent
weakness
of
that
great
lady
character
secondly
miss
müller
having
herself
for
some
reason
missed
such
joys
as
are
involved
in
being
wooed
and
won
was
disposed
to
look
sourly
upon
all
love
affairs
and
to
take
a
despondent
view
of
all
matrimonial
engagements
she
did
not
say
anything
openly
uncivil
to
mary
haselden
but
she
let
the
damsel
see
that
she
pitied
her
and
despised
her
infatuated
condition
and
this
was
so
unpleasant
that
mary
was
fain
to
fall
back
upon
the
society
of
ponies
and
terriers
and
to
take
up
her
staff
and
go
wandering
over
the
hills
carrying
her
happy
thoughts
into
solitary
places
and
sitting
for
hours
in
a
heathery
hollow
steeped
in
a
sea
of
summer
light
and
trying
to
paint
the
mountain
side
and
the
rush
of
the
waterfall
her
was
an
excuse
for
hours
of
solitude
for
the
indulgence
of
an
endless
sometimes
she
went
among
her
humble
friends
in
the
grasmere
cottages
or
in
the
villages
of
great
and
little
langdale
and
she
had
now
a
new
interest
in
these
visits
for
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
it
was
her
solemn
duty
to
learn
housekeeping
not
such
housekeeping
as
might
have
been
learnt
at
fellside
supposing
she
had
mustered
the
courage
to
ask
the
dignified
in
that
establishment
to
instruct
her
but
such
domestic
arts
as
are
needed
in
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
the
art
of
making
a
very
little
money
go
a
great
way
the
art
of
giving
grace
neatness
prettiness
to
the
smallest
rooms
and
the
shabbiest
furniture
the
art
of
packing
all
the
ugly
appliances
and
baser
necessities
of
daily
life
the
pots
and
kettles
and
brooms
and
pails
into
the
narrowest
compass
and
hiding
them
from
the
æsthetic
eye
mary
thought
that
if
she
began
by
learning
the
homely
devices
of
the
villagers
the
very
a
b
c
of
cookery
and
housewifery
she
might
gradually
enlarge
upon
this
simple
basis
to
suit
an
income
of
from
five
to
seven
hundred
a
year
the
from
whom
she
sought
information
were
puzzled
at
this
sudden
curiosity
about
domestic
matters
they
looked
upon
the
thing
as
a
freak
of
girlhood
which
drifted
into
eccentricity
from
sheer
idleness
yet
they
were
not
the
less
ready
to
teach
mary
anything
she
desired
to
learn
they
told
her
those
secret
arts
by
which
coppers
and
brasses
are
made
things
of
beauty
and
meet
adornment
for
an
old
oak
mantelshelf
they
allowed
her
to
look
on
at
the
milking
of
the
cow
and
at
the
churning
of
the
butter
and
at
bread
making
and
cake
making
and
pie
and
pudding
making
and
some
pleasant
hours
were
spent
in
the
acquirement
of
this
useful
knowledge
mary
did
not
neglect
the
invalid
during
this
new
phase
of
her
existence
lady
maulevrier
was
a
lover
of
routine
and
she
liked
her
granddaughter
to
go
to
her
at
the
same
hour
every
day
from
eleven
to
twelve
was
the
time
for
mary
duty
as
amanuensis
sometimes
there
were
no
letters
to
be
written
sometimes
there
were
several
but
her
ladyship
rarely
allowed
the
task
to
go
beyond
the
stroke
of
noon
at
noon
mary
was
free
and
free
till
five
when
she
was
generally
in
attendance
ready
to
give
lady
maulevrier
her
afternoon
tea
and
sit
and
talk
with
her
and
tell
her
any
scraps
of
local
news
which
she
had
gathered
in
the
day
there
were
days
on
which
her
ladyship
preferred
to
take
her
tea
alone
and
mary
was
left
free
to
follow
her
own
devices
till
do
not
feel
equal
even
to
your
society
my
dear
her
ladyship
would
say
and
enjoy
yourself
with
your
dogs
and
your
tennis
forgetting
that
there
was
very
seldom
anybody
on
the
premises
with
whom
lady
mary
could
play
tennis
but
in
these
lonely
days
of
mary
haselden
life
there
was
one
crowning
bliss
which
was
almost
enough
to
sweeten
solitude
and
take
away
the
sting
of
separation
and
that
was
the
delight
of
expecting
and
receiving
her
lover
letters
busily
as
hammond
must
be
engaged
in
fighting
the
battle
of
life
he
was
in
no
way
wanting
in
his
duty
as
a
lover
he
wrote
to
mary
every
other
day
but
though
his
letters
were
long
they
told
her
hardly
anything
of
himself
or
his
occupation
he
wrote
about
pictures
books
music
such
things
as
he
knew
must
be
interesting
to
her
but
of
his
own
struggles
not
a
word
fellow
thought
mary
is
afraid
to
sadden
me
by
telling
me
how
hard
the
struggle
is
her
own
letters
to
her
betrothed
were
simple
outpourings
of
girlish
love
breathing
that
too
idolatry
which
an
innocent
girl
gives
to
her
first
lover
mary
wrote
as
if
she
herself
were
of
the
least
possible
value
among
created
things
with
one
of
hammond
earlier
letters
came
the
engagement
ring
no
of
brilliants
or
sapphires
rubies
or
emeralds
no
gorgeous
triple
circlet
of
red
white
and
green
but
only
a
massive
band
of
dead
gold
on
the
inside
of
which
was
engraved
this
posy
ever
mary
thought
it
the
loveliest
ring
she
had
ever
seen
in
her
life
may
was
half
over
and
the
last
patch
of
snow
had
vanished
from
the
crest
of
helvellyn
from
eagle
crag
and
raven
crag
and
coniston
old
man
spring
slow
to
come
along
these
shadowy
gorges
had
come
in
real
earnest
now
spring
that
was
almost
summer
and
lady
gardens
were
as
lovely
as
dreamland
but
it
was
an
unpeopled
paradise
mary
had
the
grounds
all
to
herself
except
at
those
stated
times
when
the
fräulein
who
was
growing
lazier
and
larger
day
by
day
in
her
leisurely
and
placid
existence
took
her
morning
and
afternoon
constitutional
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
or
solemnly
perambulated
the
shrubberies
on
fine
days
mary
lived
in
the
garden
save
when
she
was
far
afield
learning
the
domestic
arts
from
the
cottagers
she
read
french
and
german
and
worked
conscientiously
at
her
intellectual
education
as
well
as
at
domestic
economy
for
she
told
herself
that
accomplishments
and
culture
might
be
useful
to
her
in
her
married
life
she
might
be
able
to
increase
her
husband
means
by
giving
lessons
abroad
or
taking
pupils
at
home
she
was
ready
to
do
anything
she
would
teach
the
stupidest
children
or
scrub
floors
or
bake
bread
there
was
no
service
she
would
deem
degrading
for
his
sake
she
meant
when
she
married
to
drop
her
courtesy
title
she
would
not
be
lady
mary
hammond
a
poor
sprig
of
nobility
but
plain
hammond
a
working
man
wife
lesbia
presentation
was
over
and
had
realised
all
lady
expectations
the
society
papers
were
unanimous
in
pronouncing
lord
maulevrier
sister
the
prettiest
of
the
season
they
praised
her
classical
features
the
admirable
poise
of
her
head
her
peerless
complexion
they
described
her
dress
at
the
they
described
her
in
the
park
and
at
sandown
they
expatiated
on
the
impression
she
had
made
at
great
assemblies
they
hinted
at
even
royal
admiration
all
this
frivolous
fribble
though
it
might
be
lady
maulevrier
read
with
delight
and
she
was
still
more
gratified
by
lesbia
own
account
of
her
successes
but
as
the
season
advanced
lesbia
letters
to
her
grandmother
grew
briefer
mere
hurried
scrawls
dashed
off
while
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
or
while
her
maid
was
brushing
her
hair
lady
maulevrier
divined
with
the
keen
instinct
of
love
that
she
counted
for
very
little
in
lesbia
life
now
that
the
whirligig
of
society
the
fret
and
fever
of
fashion
had
begun
one
afternoon
in
may
at
that
hour
when
hyde
park
is
fullest
and
the
carriages
move
slowly
in
triple
rank
along
the
lady
mile
and
the
mounted
constables
jog
up
and
down
with
a
air
which
sets
every
one
on
the
alert
for
the
advent
of
the
princess
of
wales
just
at
that
hour
when
lesbia
sat
in
lady
kirkbank
barouche
and
distributed
gracious
bows
and
enthralling
smiles
to
her
numerous
acquaintance
mary
rode
slowly
down
the
fell
after
a
rambling
ride
on
the
safest
and
most
venerable
of
mountain
ponies
the
pony
was
grey
and
mary
was
grey
for
she
wore
a
neat
little
homespun
habit
made
by
the
local
tailor
and
a
neat
little
felt
hat
with
a
ptarmigan
feather
all
was
very
quiet
at
fellside
as
she
went
in
at
the
stable
gate
there
was
not
an
underling
stirring
in
the
large
old
which
had
remained
almost
unaltered
for
a
century
and
a
half
for
lady
maulevrier
whilst
spending
thousands
on
the
new
part
of
the
house
had
deemed
the
existing
stables
good
enough
for
her
stud
they
were
spacious
old
stables
built
as
solidly
as
a
norman
castle
and
with
all
the
virtues
and
all
the
vices
of
their
age
mary
looked
round
her
with
a
sigh
the
stillness
of
the
place
was
oppressive
and
within
doors
she
knew
there
would
be
the
same
stillness
made
still
more
oppressive
by
the
society
of
the
fräulein
who
grew
duller
and
duller
every
day
as
it
seemed
to
mary
she
took
her
pony
into
the
dusky
old
stable
where
four
other
ponies
began
rattling
their
halters
in
the
gloom
by
way
of
greeting
a
bundle
of
purple
tares
lay
ready
in
a
corner
for
mary
to
feed
her
favourites
and
for
the
next
ten
minutes
or
so
she
was
happily
employed
going
from
stall
to
stall
and
gratifying
that
inordinate
appetite
for
green
meat
which
seems
natural
to
all
horses
not
a
groom
or
appeared
while
she
was
in
the
stable
and
she
was
just
going
away
when
her
attention
was
caught
by
a
flood
of
sunshine
streaming
into
an
old
disused
at
the
end
of
the
stable
a
room
with
one
small
window
facing
the
fell
whence
could
that
glow
of
western
light
come
assuredly
not
from
the
window
which
faced
eastward
and
was
generally
obscured
by
a
screen
of
cobwebs
the
room
was
only
used
as
a
storehouse
for
lumber
and
it
was
nobody
business
to
clean
the
window
mary
looked
in
curious
to
solve
the
riddle
a
door
which
she
had
often
noticed
but
never
seen
opened
now
stood
wide
open
and
the
old
quadrangular
garden
which
was
james
steadman
particular
care
smiled
at
her
in
the
golden
evening
light
seen
thus
this
little
old
dutch
garden
seemed
to
mary
the
prettiest
thing
she
had
ever
looked
upon
there
were
beds
of
tulips
and
hyacinths
ranunculus
narcissus
tuberose
making
a
blaze
of
colour
against
the
old
box
borders
a
foot
high
the
crumbling
old
brick
walls
of
the
outbuildings
and
that
wall
which
formed
the
back
of
the
new
house
were
clothed
with
clematis
and
wistaria
woodbine
and
magnolia
all
that
loving
labour
could
do
had
been
done
day
by
day
for
the
last
forty
years
to
make
this
confined
space
a
thing
of
beauty
mary
went
out
of
the
dark
stable
into
the
sunny
garden
and
looked
round
her
full
of
admiration
for
james
steadman
work
ever
jack
and
i
can
afford
to
have
a
garden
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
make
it
like
this
she
thought
is
such
a
comfort
to
know
that
so
small
a
garden
can
be
pretty
for
of
course
any
garden
we
could
afford
must
be
small
lady
mary
had
no
idea
that
this
quadrangle
was
spacious
as
compared
with
the
narrow
strip
allotted
to
many
a
suburban
villa
calling
itself
eligible
residence
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
there
was
an
old
sundial
with
a
stone
bench
at
the
base
and
as
she
came
upon
an
opening
in
the
circular
yew
tree
hedge
which
environed
this
sundial
and
from
which
the
flower
beds
radiated
in
a
geometrical
pattern
lady
mary
was
surprised
to
see
an
old
man
a
very
old
man
sitting
on
this
bench
and
basking
in
the
low
light
of
the
westering
sun
his
figure
was
shrunken
and
bent
and
he
sat
with
his
chin
resting
on
the
handle
of
a
crutched
stick
and
his
head
leaning
forward
his
long
white
hair
fell
in
thin
straggling
locks
over
the
collar
of
his
coat
he
had
an
mummyfied
aspect
and
mary
thought
he
must
be
very
very
old
very
very
old
in
a
flash
there
came
back
upon
her
the
memory
of
john
hammond
curiosity
about
a
hoary
and
withered
old
man
whom
he
had
met
on
the
fell
in
the
early
morning
she
remembered
how
she
had
taken
him
to
see
old
sam
barlow
and
how
he
had
protested
that
sam
in
no
wise
resembled
the
old
man
of
the
fell
and
now
here
close
to
the
fell
was
a
face
and
figure
which
in
every
detail
resembled
that
ancient
stranger
whom
hammond
had
described
so
graphically
it
was
very
strange
could
this
person
be
the
same
her
lover
had
seen
two
months
ago
and
if
so
had
he
been
living
at
fellside
all
the
time
or
was
he
only
an
occasional
visitor
of
steadman
while
she
stood
for
a
few
moments
meditating
thus
the
old
man
raised
his
head
and
looked
up
at
her
with
eyes
that
burned
like
coals
under
his
shaggy
white
brows
the
look
scared
her
there
was
something
awful
in
it
like
the
gaze
of
an
evil
spirit
a
soul
in
torment
and
she
began
to
move
away
with
steps
her
eyes
riveted
on
that
uncanny
countenance
go
said
the
man
with
an
authoritative
air
rattling
his
bony
fingers
upon
the
bench
down
here
by
my
side
and
talk
to
me
be
frightened
child
you
would
if
you
knew
what
they
say
of
me
indoors
he
made
a
motion
of
his
head
towards
the
windows
of
the
old
wing
harmless
they
say
quite
harmless
let
him
alone
harmless
a
tiger
with
his
claws
cut
and
his
teeth
drawn
an
old
tiger
ghastly
and
grim
but
harmless
a
cobra
with
the
plucked
out
of
his
jaw
the
venom
grows
again
child
the
snake
venom
but
youth
never
comes
back
old
and
helpless
and
harmless
again
mary
tried
to
move
away
but
those
evil
eyes
held
her
as
if
she
were
a
bird
riveted
by
the
gaze
of
a
serpent
do
you
shrink
away
asked
the
old
man
frowning
at
her
down
here
and
let
me
talk
to
you
i
am
accustomed
to
be
obeyed
old
and
feeble
and
shrunken
as
he
was
there
was
a
power
in
his
tone
of
command
which
mary
was
unable
to
resist
she
felt
very
sure
that
he
was
imbecile
or
mad
she
knew
that
madmen
are
apt
to
imagine
themselves
great
personages
and
to
take
upon
themselves
with
a
wonderful
power
of
impersonation
the
dignity
and
authority
of
their
imaginary
rank
and
she
supposed
that
it
must
be
thus
with
this
strange
old
man
she
struggled
against
her
sense
of
terror
after
all
there
could
be
no
real
danger
in
the
broad
daylight
within
the
precincts
of
her
own
home
within
call
of
the
household
she
seated
herself
on
the
bench
by
the
unknown
willing
to
humour
him
a
little
and
he
turned
himself
about
slowly
as
if
every
bone
in
his
body
were
stiff
with
age
and
looked
at
her
with
a
deliberate
scrutiny
chapter
xxiv
nothing
left
to
love
or
hate
the
old
man
sat
looking
at
mary
in
silence
for
some
moments
not
a
great
space
of
time
perhaps
as
marked
by
the
shadow
on
the
dial
behind
them
but
to
mary
that
gaze
was
unpleasantly
prolonged
he
looked
at
her
as
if
he
could
read
every
pulsation
in
every
fibre
of
her
brain
and
knew
exactly
what
it
meant
are
you
he
asked
at
last
name
is
mary
haselden
he
repeated
musingly
have
heard
that
name
before
and
then
he
resumed
his
former
attitude
his
chin
resting
on
the
handle
of
his
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
gravel
path
their
unholy
brightness
hidden
under
the
penthouse
brows
he
murmured
and
repeated
the
name
over
and
over
again
slowly
dreamily
with
a
troubled
tone
like
some
one
trying
to
work
out
a
difficult
problem
when
where
and
then
with
a
profound
sigh
he
muttered
quite
harmless
you
may
trust
him
anywhere
memory
a
blank
a
blank
a
blank
my
lord
his
head
sank
lower
upon
his
breast
and
again
he
sighed
the
sigh
of
a
spirit
in
torment
mary
thought
her
vivid
imagination
was
already
interested
her
quick
sympathies
were
awakened
she
looked
at
him
wonderingly
compassionately
so
old
so
infirm
and
with
a
mind
astray
and
yet
there
were
indications
in
his
speech
and
manner
that
told
of
reason
struggling
against
madness
like
the
light
behind
he
had
tones
that
spoke
of
a
keen
sensitiveness
to
pain
not
the
lunatic
imbecile
placidity
she
observed
him
intently
trying
to
make
out
what
manner
of
man
he
was
he
did
not
belong
to
the
peasant
class
of
that
she
felt
assured
the
shrunken
tapering
hand
had
never
worked
at
peasant
work
the
profile
turned
towards
her
was
delicate
to
effeminacy
the
man
clothes
were
shabby
and
but
they
were
a
gentleman
garments
the
cloth
of
a
finer
texture
than
she
had
ever
seen
worn
by
her
brother
the
coat
with
its
velvet
collar
was
of
an
fashion
she
remembered
having
seen
just
such
a
coat
in
an
engraved
portrait
of
count
a
print
nearly
fifty
years
old
no
dalesman
born
and
bred
ever
wore
such
a
coat
no
tailor
in
the
dales
could
have
made
it
the
old
man
looked
up
after
a
long
pause
during
which
mary
felt
afraid
to
move
he
looked
at
her
again
with
inquiring
eyes
as
if
her
presence
there
had
only
just
become
known
to
him
are
you
he
asked
again
told
you
my
name
just
now
i
am
mary
haselden
that
is
a
name
i
knew
once
mary
i
think
my
mother
name
was
mary
yes
yes
i
remember
that
you
have
a
sweet
face
mary
like
my
mother
she
had
brown
eyes
like
yours
and
auburn
hair
you
recollect
her
perhaps
poor
maniac
thought
mary
have
lost
all
count
of
time
fifty
years
to
you
in
the
confusion
of
your
distraught
brain
are
but
as
yesterday
of
course
not
of
course
not
he
muttered
should
she
recollect
my
mother
who
died
while
i
was
a
boy
impossible
that
must
be
half
a
century
ago
evening
to
you
said
mary
rising
with
a
great
effort
so
strong
was
her
feeling
of
being
spellbound
by
the
uncanny
old
man
must
go
indoors
now
he
stretched
out
his
withered
old
hand
small
with
the
blue
veins
showing
darkly
under
the
skin
and
grasped
mary
arm
go
he
pleaded
like
your
face
child
i
like
your
voice
i
like
to
have
you
here
what
do
you
mean
by
going
indoors
where
do
you
live
said
mary
pointing
to
the
dead
wall
which
faced
them
the
new
part
of
fellside
house
i
suppose
you
are
staying
in
the
old
part
with
james
steadman
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
this
crazy
old
man
must
be
a
relation
of
steadman
to
whom
he
gave
hospitality
either
with
or
without
her
ladyship
consent
all
powerful
as
lady
maulevrier
had
ever
been
in
her
own
house
it
was
just
possible
that
now
when
she
was
a
prisoner
in
her
own
rooms
certain
small
liberties
might
be
taken
even
by
so
faithful
a
servant
as
steadman
with
james
steadman
repeated
the
old
man
in
a
meditative
tone
i
stay
with
steadman
a
good
servant
a
worthy
person
it
is
only
for
a
little
while
i
shall
be
leaving
westmoreland
next
week
and
you
live
in
that
house
do
you
pointing
to
the
dead
wall
house
maulevrier
i
am
lady
maulevrier
granddaughter
he
repeated
the
name
in
syllables
good
name
an
old
title
as
old
as
the
conquest
a
norman
race
those
maulevriers
and
you
are
lady
maulevrier
granddaughter
you
should
be
proud
the
maulevriers
were
always
a
proud
race
i
am
no
true
maulevrier
answered
mary
gaily
she
was
beginning
to
feel
more
at
her
ease
with
the
old
man
he
was
evidently
mad
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
but
his
madness
seemed
only
the
harmless
lunacy
of
extreme
old
age
he
had
flashes
of
reason
too
mary
began
to
feel
a
friendly
interest
in
him
to
youth
in
its
flush
of
life
and
vigour
there
seems
something
so
unspeakably
sad
and
pitiable
in
feebleness
and
age
the
brief
weak
remnant
of
life
the
wreck
of
body
and
mind
sunning
itself
in
the
declining
rays
of
a
sun
that
is
so
soon
to
shine
upon
its
grave
are
you
not
proud
asked
the
old
man
at
all
i
have
been
taught
to
consider
myself
a
very
insignificant
person
and
i
am
going
to
marry
a
poor
man
it
would
not
become
me
to
be
proud
you
ought
not
to
do
that
said
the
old
man
ought
not
to
marry
a
poor
man
poverty
is
a
bad
thing
my
dear
you
are
a
pretty
girl
and
ought
to
marry
a
man
with
a
handsome
fortune
poor
men
have
no
pleasure
in
this
world
they
might
just
as
well
be
dead
i
am
poor
as
you
see
you
can
tell
by
this
threadbare
coat
he
looked
down
at
the
sleeve
from
which
the
nap
was
worn
in
places
am
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
you
have
kind
friends
i
dare
say
mary
said
soothingly
are
well
taken
care
of
i
am
sure
i
am
well
taken
care
of
very
well
taken
care
of
how
long
is
it
i
wonder
how
many
weeks
or
months
or
years
since
they
have
taken
care
of
me
it
seems
a
long
long
time
but
it
is
all
like
a
dream
a
long
dream
once
i
used
to
try
and
wake
myself
i
used
to
try
and
struggle
out
of
that
weary
dream
but
that
was
ages
ago
i
am
satisfied
now
i
am
quite
content
now
so
long
as
the
weather
is
warm
and
i
can
sit
out
here
in
the
sun
is
growing
chilly
now
said
mary
i
think
you
ought
to
go
indoors
i
know
that
i
must
go
i
must
go
in
now
i
am
getting
shivery
answered
the
old
man
meekly
i
want
to
see
you
again
mary
i
like
your
face
and
i
like
your
voice
it
strikes
a
chord
here
touching
his
breast
has
long
been
silent
let
me
see
you
again
child
when
can
i
see
you
again
you
sit
here
every
afternoon
when
it
is
fine
every
day
all
day
long
sometimes
when
the
sun
is
warm
i
will
come
here
to
see
you
must
keep
it
a
secret
then
said
the
old
man
with
a
crafty
look
you
do
they
will
shut
me
up
in
the
house
perhaps
they
like
me
to
see
people
for
fear
i
should
talk
i
have
heard
steadman
say
so
yet
what
should
i
talk
about
heaven
help
me
steadman
says
my
memory
is
quite
gone
and
that
i
am
childish
and
harmless
childish
and
harmless
i
have
heard
him
say
that
you
come
again
wo
you
and
you
keep
it
a
secret
mary
deliberated
for
a
few
minutes
do
like
secrets
she
said
is
generally
something
dishonourable
in
them
but
this
would
be
an
innocent
secret
it
well
i
come
to
see
you
somehow
poor
old
man
and
if
steadman
sees
me
here
i
will
make
everything
right
with
him
must
see
you
here
said
the
old
man
he
does
he
will
shut
me
up
in
my
own
rooms
again
as
he
did
once
years
and
years
ago
you
have
not
been
here
long
have
you
mary
asked
wonderingly
hundred
years
at
least
that
what
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
and
yet
there
are
times
when
it
seems
only
a
dream
be
sure
you
come
again
i
promise
you
to
come
mary
went
back
to
the
stable
the
door
was
still
open
but
how
could
she
be
sure
that
it
would
be
open
there
was
no
other
access
that
she
knew
of
to
the
quadrangle
except
through
the
old
part
of
the
house
and
that
was
at
times
inaccessible
to
her
she
found
a
key
a
big
old
rusty
key
in
the
inside
of
the
door
so
she
shut
and
locked
it
and
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
the
door
she
supposed
had
been
left
open
by
accident
at
any
rate
this
key
made
her
mistress
of
the
situation
if
any
question
should
arise
as
to
her
conduct
she
could
have
an
explanation
with
steadman
but
she
had
pledged
her
word
to
the
poor
mad
old
man
and
she
meant
to
keep
her
promise
if
possible
as
she
left
the
stable
she
saw
steadman
riding
towards
the
gate
on
his
grey
cob
she
passed
him
as
she
went
back
to
the
house
next
day
and
the
day
after
that
and
for
many
days
mary
used
her
key
and
went
into
the
quadrangle
at
sundown
to
sit
for
half
an
hour
or
so
with
the
strange
old
man
who
seemed
to
take
an
intense
pleasure
in
her
company
the
weather
was
growing
warmer
as
may
wore
on
towards
june
and
this
evening
hour
between
six
and
seven
was
deliciously
bright
and
balmy
the
seat
by
the
sundial
was
screened
on
every
side
by
the
clipped
yew
hedge
dense
and
tall
surrounding
the
circular
gravelled
space
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
the
old
granite
dial
with
its
octagonal
pedestal
and
steps
there
as
in
a
arbour
lady
mary
and
her
old
friend
were
alone
and
unobserved
the
boundary
was
at
least
eight
feet
high
and
mary
and
her
companion
could
hardly
have
been
seen
even
from
the
upper
windows
of
the
low
old
house
mary
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
going
for
her
walk
or
her
ride
at
five
every
day
when
she
was
not
in
attendance
on
lady
maulevrier
and
after
her
walk
or
ride
she
slipped
through
the
stable
and
joined
her
ancient
friend
stables
and
courtyard
were
generally
empty
at
this
hour
the
men
only
appearing
at
the
sound
of
a
big
bell
which
summoned
them
from
their
snuggery
when
they
were
wanted
most
of
lady
maulevrier
servants
had
arrived
at
that
respectable
stage
of
long
service
in
which
fidelity
is
counted
as
a
substitute
for
hard
work
the
old
man
was
not
particularly
conversational
and
was
apt
to
repeat
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
with
a
sublime
unconsciousness
of
being
prosy
but
he
liked
to
hear
mary
talk
and
he
listened
with
seeming
intelligence
he
questioned
her
about
the
world
outside
his
cloistered
life
the
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
and
although
the
names
of
the
questions
and
the
men
of
the
day
seemed
utterly
strange
to
him
and
he
had
to
have
them
repeated
to
him
again
and
again
he
seemed
to
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
stirring
facts
of
the
time
and
listened
intently
when
mary
gave
him
a
synopsis
of
her
last
newspaper
reading
when
the
news
was
exhausted
mary
hit
upon
a
more
childish
form
of
amusement
and
that
was
to
tell
the
story
of
any
novel
or
poem
she
had
been
lately
reading
this
was
so
successful
that
in
this
manner
mary
related
the
stories
of
most
of
shakespeare
plays
of
byron
bride
of
abydos
and
corsair
of
keats
lamia
of
tennyson
idylls
and
of
a
heterogenous
collection
of
poetry
and
romance
in
all
of
which
stories
the
old
man
took
a
vivid
interest
are
better
to
me
than
the
sunshine
he
told
mary
one
day
when
she
was
leaving
him
world
grows
darker
when
you
leave
me
once
at
this
parting
moment
he
took
both
her
hands
and
drew
her
nearer
to
him
peering
into
her
face
in
the
clear
evening
light
are
like
my
mother
he
said
you
are
very
like
her
and
who
else
is
it
that
you
are
like
there
is
some
one
else
i
know
yes
some
one
else
i
remember
it
is
a
face
in
a
picture
a
picture
at
maulevrier
castle
do
you
know
of
maulevrier
castle
asked
mary
wonderingly
maulevrier
was
the
family
seat
in
herefordshire
which
had
not
been
occupied
by
the
elder
branch
for
the
last
forty
years
lady
maulevrier
had
let
it
during
her
son
minority
to
a
younger
branch
of
the
family
a
branch
which
had
intermarried
with
the
world
of
successful
commerce
and
was
richer
than
the
heads
of
the
house
this
occupation
of
maulevrier
castle
had
continued
to
the
present
time
and
was
likely
still
to
continue
maulevrier
having
no
desire
to
set
up
housekeeping
in
a
feudal
castle
in
the
marches
came
you
to
know
maulevrier
castle
repeated
mary
was
there
once
there
is
a
picture
by
lely
a
portrait
of
a
lady
maulevrier
in
charles
the
second
time
the
face
is
yours
my
love
i
have
heard
of
such
hereditary
faces
my
mother
was
proud
of
resembling
that
portrait
did
your
mother
know
of
maulevrier
castle
the
old
man
did
not
answer
he
had
lapsed
into
that
condition
into
which
he
often
sank
when
his
brain
was
not
stimulated
to
attention
and
coherency
by
his
interest
in
mary
narrations
mary
concluded
that
this
man
had
once
been
a
servant
in
the
maulevrier
household
perhaps
at
the
place
in
herefordshire
and
that
all
his
old
memories
ran
in
one
groove
the
house
of
maulevrier
the
freedom
of
her
intercourse
with
him
was
undisturbed
for
about
three
weeks
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
came
face
to
face
with
james
steadman
as
she
emerged
from
the
circle
of
greenery
here
lady
mary
he
exclaimed
with
an
angry
look
i
have
been
sitting
talking
to
that
poor
old
man
mary
answered
cheerily
concluding
that
steadman
look
of
vexation
arose
from
his
being
detected
in
the
act
of
harbouring
a
contraband
relation
is
a
very
interesting
character
a
relation
of
yours
i
suppose
he
is
a
relation
replied
steadman
is
very
old
and
his
mind
has
long
been
gone
her
ladyship
is
kind
enough
to
allow
me
to
give
him
a
home
in
her
house
he
is
quite
harmless
and
he
is
in
nobody
way
course
not
poor
soul
he
is
only
a
burden
to
himself
he
talks
as
if
his
life
had
been
very
weary
has
he
been
long
in
that
sad
state
a
long
time
steadman
manner
to
lady
mary
was
curt
at
the
best
of
times
she
had
always
stood
somewhat
in
awe
of
him
as
a
person
delegated
with
authority
by
her
grandmother
a
servant
who
was
much
more
than
a
servant
but
his
manner
was
more
abrupt
than
usual
spoke
of
maulevrier
castle
just
now
said
mary
determined
not
to
be
put
down
too
easily
he
once
in
service
there
was
pray
how
did
you
find
your
way
into
this
garden
lady
mary
came
through
the
stable
as
it
is
my
grandmother
garden
i
suppose
i
did
not
take
an
unwarrantable
liberty
in
coming
said
mary
drawing
herself
up
and
ready
for
battle
is
lady
maulevrier
wish
that
this
garden
should
be
reserved
for
my
use
answered
steadman
ladyship
knows
that
my
uncle
walks
here
of
an
afternoon
and
that
owing
to
his
age
and
infirmities
he
can
go
nowhere
else
and
if
only
on
that
account
it
is
well
that
the
garden
should
be
kept
private
lunatics
are
rather
dangerous
company
lady
mary
and
i
advise
you
to
give
them
a
wide
berth
wherever
you
may
meet
them
am
not
afraid
of
your
uncle
said
mary
resolutely
said
yourself
just
now
that
he
is
quite
harmless
and
i
am
really
interested
in
him
poor
old
creature
he
likes
me
to
sit
with
him
a
little
of
an
afternoon
and
to
talk
to
him
and
if
you
have
no
objection
i
should
like
to
do
so
whenever
the
weather
is
fine
enough
for
the
poor
old
man
to
be
out
in
the
garden
at
this
hour
have
a
very
great
objection
lady
mary
and
that
objection
is
chiefly
in
your
interest
answered
steadman
firmly
one
who
is
not
experienced
in
the
ways
of
lunatics
can
imagine
the
danger
of
any
association
with
them
their
consummate
craftiness
their
capacity
for
crime
every
madman
is
harmless
up
to
a
certain
point
mild
inoffensive
perhaps
up
to
the
very
moment
in
which
he
commits
some
appalling
crime
and
then
people
cry
out
upon
the
want
of
prudence
the
want
of
which
allowed
such
an
act
to
be
possible
no
lady
mary
i
understand
the
benevolence
of
your
motive
but
i
can
not
permit
you
to
run
such
a
risk
am
convinced
that
the
poor
old
creature
is
perfectly
harmless
said
mary
with
suppressed
indignation
shall
certainly
ask
lady
maulevrier
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
perhaps
her
influence
may
induce
you
to
be
a
little
more
considerate
to
your
unhappy
relation
mary
i
beg
you
not
to
say
a
word
to
lady
maulevrier
on
this
subject
you
will
do
me
the
greatest
injury
if
you
speak
of
that
man
i
entreat
you
but
mary
was
gone
she
passed
steadman
with
her
head
held
high
and
her
eyes
sparkling
with
anger
all
that
was
generous
compassionate
womanly
in
her
nature
was
up
in
arms
against
her
grandmother
steward
of
all
other
things
mary
haselden
most
detested
cruelty
and
she
could
see
in
steadman
opposition
to
her
wish
nothing
but
the
most
cruelty
to
a
poor
dependent
on
his
charity
she
went
in
at
the
stable
door
shut
and
locked
it
and
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
as
usual
but
she
had
little
hope
that
this
mode
of
access
would
be
left
open
to
her
she
knew
enough
of
james
character
from
hearsay
rather
than
from
experience
to
feel
sure
that
he
would
not
easily
give
way
she
was
not
surprised
therefore
on
returning
from
her
ride
on
the
following
afternoon
to
find
the
disused
half
filled
with
trusses
of
straw
and
the
door
of
communication
completely
blocked
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
remove
that
barricade
without
assistance
and
then
how
could
she
be
sure
that
the
door
itself
was
not
nailed
up
or
secured
in
some
way
it
was
a
delicious
sunny
afternoon
and
she
could
picture
the
lonely
old
man
sitting
in
his
circle
of
greenery
beside
the
dial
which
for
him
had
registered
so
many
dreary
and
solitary
hours
waiting
for
the
little
ray
of
social
sunlight
which
her
presence
shed
over
his
monotonous
life
he
had
told
her
that
she
was
like
the
sunshine
to
him
better
than
sunshine
and
she
had
promised
not
to
forsake
him
she
pictured
him
waiting
with
his
hand
clasped
upon
his
his
chin
resting
upon
his
hands
his
eyes
poring
on
the
ground
as
she
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
and
as
the
stable
clock
chimed
the
quarters
he
would
begin
to
think
himself
abandoned
forgotten
if
indeed
he
took
any
count
of
the
passage
of
time
of
which
she
was
not
sure
his
mind
seemed
to
have
sunk
into
a
condition
which
was
between
dreaming
and
waking
a
state
to
which
the
outside
world
seemed
only
half
real
a
phase
of
being
in
which
there
was
neither
past
nor
future
only
the
insufferable
monotony
of
an
everlasting
pity
is
so
near
akin
to
love
that
mary
in
her
deep
compassion
for
this
lonely
joyless
loveless
existence
felt
a
regard
which
was
almost
affection
for
this
strange
old
man
whose
very
name
was
unknown
to
her
true
that
there
was
much
in
his
countenance
and
manner
which
was
sinister
and
repellant
he
was
a
being
calculated
to
inspire
fear
rather
than
love
but
the
fact
that
he
had
courted
her
presence
and
looked
to
her
for
consolation
had
touched
mary
heart
and
she
had
become
reconciled
to
all
that
was
forbidding
and
disagreeable
in
the
lunatic
physiognomy
was
he
not
the
victim
of
a
visitation
which
entitled
him
to
respect
as
well
as
to
pity
for
some
days
mary
held
her
peace
remembering
steadman
vehement
entreaty
that
she
should
not
speak
of
this
subject
to
her
grandmother
she
was
silent
but
the
image
of
the
old
man
haunted
her
at
all
times
and
seasons
she
saw
him
even
in
her
dreams
those
happy
dreams
of
the
girl
who
loves
and
is
beloved
and
before
whom
the
pathway
of
the
future
smiles
like
a
vision
of
paradise
she
heard
him
calling
to
her
with
a
piteous
cry
of
distress
and
on
waking
from
this
troubled
dream
she
fancied
that
he
must
be
dying
and
that
this
sound
in
her
dreams
was
one
of
those
ghostly
warnings
which
give
notice
of
death
she
was
so
unhappy
about
him
altogether
so
distressed
at
being
compelled
to
break
her
word
that
she
could
not
prevent
her
thoughts
from
dwelling
upon
him
not
even
after
she
had
poured
out
all
her
trouble
to
john
hammond
in
a
long
letter
in
which
her
garden
adventures
and
her
little
skirmish
with
steadman
were
graphically
described
to
her
intense
discomfiture
hammond
replied
that
he
thoroughly
approved
of
steadman
conduct
in
the
matter
however
agreeable
mary
society
might
be
to
the
lunatic
mary
life
was
far
too
precious
to
be
put
within
the
possibility
of
peril
by
any
such
if
the
person
was
the
same
old
man
whom
hammond
had
seen
on
the
fell
he
was
a
most
creature
of
whom
any
evil
act
might
be
fairly
anticipated
in
a
word
hammond
took
steadman
view
of
the
matter
and
entreated
his
dearest
mary
to
be
careful
and
not
to
allow
her
warm
heart
to
place
her
in
circumstances
of
peril
this
was
most
disappointing
to
mary
who
expected
her
lover
to
agree
with
her
upon
every
point
and
if
he
had
been
at
fellside
the
difference
of
opinion
might
have
given
rise
to
their
first
quarrel
but
as
she
had
a
few
hours
leisure
for
reflection
before
the
post
went
out
she
had
time
to
get
over
her
anger
and
to
remember
that
promise
of
obedience
given
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
at
the
little
inn
beyond
dunmail
raise
so
she
wrote
submissively
enough
only
with
just
a
touch
of
reproach
at
jack
want
of
compassion
for
a
poor
old
man
who
had
such
strong
claims
upon
everybody
pity
the
image
of
the
poor
old
man
was
not
to
be
banished
from
her
thoughts
and
on
that
very
afternoon
when
her
letter
was
dispatched
mary
went
on
a
visit
of
exploration
to
the
stables
to
see
if
by
any
chance
steadman
plans
for
isolating
his
unhappy
relative
might
be
circumvented
she
went
all
over
the
stables
into
loose
boxes
harness
and
saddle
rooms
sheds
for
wood
and
sheds
for
roots
but
she
found
no
door
opening
into
the
quadrangle
save
that
door
by
which
she
had
entered
and
which
was
securely
defended
by
a
barricade
of
straw
that
had
been
doubled
by
a
fresh
delivery
of
trusses
since
she
first
saw
it
but
while
she
was
prowling
about
the
stable
much
disappointed
at
the
result
of
her
investigations
she
stumbled
against
a
ladder
which
led
to
an
open
mary
mounted
the
ladder
and
found
herself
amidst
the
dusty
atmosphere
of
a
large
hayloft
half
in
shadow
half
in
the
hot
bright
sunlight
a
large
shutter
was
open
in
the
sloping
roof
the
roof
that
sloped
towards
the
quadrangle
an
open
patch
admitting
light
and
air
mary
light
and
active
as
a
squirrel
sprang
upon
a
truss
of
hay
and
in
another
moment
had
swung
herself
in
the
opening
of
the
shutter
and
was
standing
with
her
feet
on
the
wooden
ledge
at
the
bottom
of
the
massive
frame
and
her
figure
supported
against
the
slope
of
thick
thatched
roof
perched
or
half
suspended
thus
she
was
just
high
enough
to
look
over
the
top
of
the
hedge
into
the
circle
round
the
sundial
yes
there
was
the
unhappy
victim
of
fate
and
man
inhumanity
to
man
there
sat
the
shrunken
figure
with
drooping
head
and
melancholy
attitude
the
bent
shoulders
of
feeble
old
age
the
patriarchal
locks
so
appealing
to
pity
there
he
sat
with
eyes
poring
upon
the
ground
just
as
she
had
seen
him
the
first
time
and
while
she
had
sat
with
him
and
talked
with
him
he
had
seemed
to
awaken
out
of
that
dull
despondency
gleams
of
pleasure
had
lighted
up
his
wrinkled
face
he
had
grown
animated
a
sentient
living
instead
of
a
corpse
alive
it
was
very
hard
that
this
little
interval
of
life
these
stray
gleams
of
gladness
should
be
denied
to
the
poor
old
creature
at
the
behest
of
james
steadman
mary
would
have
felt
less
angrily
upon
the
subject
had
she
believed
in
steadman
supreme
carefulness
of
her
own
safety
but
in
this
she
did
not
believe
she
looked
upon
the
prudence
as
a
hypocritical
pretence
an
affectation
of
fidelity
and
wisdom
by
which
he
contrived
to
gratify
the
evil
tendencies
of
his
own
hard
and
cruel
nature
for
some
reasons
of
his
own
perhaps
constrained
thereto
by
necessity
he
had
given
the
old
man
an
asylum
for
his
age
and
infirmity
but
while
thus
giving
him
shelter
he
considered
him
a
burden
and
from
mere
perversity
of
mind
refused
him
all
such
consolations
as
were
possible
to
his
afflicted
state
mewed
him
up
as
a
prisoner
cut
him
off
from
the
companionship
of
his
two
years
ago
before
mary
emerged
from
her
tomboyhood
she
would
have
thought
very
little
of
letting
herself
out
of
the
loft
window
and
clambering
down
the
side
of
the
stable
which
was
well
furnished
with
those
projections
in
the
way
of
gutters
and
ivy
which
make
such
a
descent
easy
two
years
ago
mary
light
figure
would
have
swung
itself
down
among
the
ivy
leaves
and
she
would
have
gloried
in
the
thought
of
circumventing
james
steadman
so
easily
but
now
mary
was
a
young
lady
a
young
lady
engaged
to
be
married
and
impressed
with
the
responsibilities
of
her
position
deeply
sensible
of
a
new
dignity
for
the
preservation
of
which
she
was
in
a
manner
answerable
to
her
lover
would
think
of
me
if
i
went
scrambling
down
the
ivy
she
asked
herself
after
he
has
approved
of
steadman
heartless
restrictions
it
would
be
rank
rebellion
against
him
if
i
were
to
do
it
poor
old
man
thou
art
so
near
and
yet
so
far
as
lesbia
song
says
she
blew
a
kiss
on
the
tips
of
her
fingers
towards
that
sad
solitary
figure
and
then
dropped
back
into
the
dusty
duskiness
of
the
loft
but
although
her
new
ideas
upon
the
subject
of
or
good
behaviour
prevented
her
getting
the
better
of
steadman
by
foul
means
she
was
all
the
more
intent
upon
having
her
own
way
by
fair
means
now
that
the
impression
of
the
old
man
sadness
and
solitude
had
been
renewed
by
the
sight
of
the
drooping
figure
by
the
sundial
she
went
back
to
the
house
and
walked
straight
to
her
room
lady
maulevrier
couch
had
been
placed
in
front
of
the
open
window
from
which
she
was
watching
the
sun
above
the
long
line
of
hills
dark
helvellyn
rugged
nabb
scarr
and
verdant
fairfield
with
its
two
giant
arms
stretched
out
to
enfold
and
shelter
the
smiling
valley
child
what
an
object
you
are
exclaimed
her
ladyship
as
mary
drew
near
your
gown
is
all
over
dust
and
your
hair
is
why
your
hair
is
sprinkled
with
hay
and
clover
i
thought
you
had
learnt
to
be
tidy
since
your
engagement
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
have
been
up
in
the
hayloft
answered
mary
frankly
and
intent
on
one
idea
she
said
impetuously
grandmother
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
a
very
great
favour
there
is
a
poor
old
man
a
relation
of
steadman
who
lives
with
him
out
of
his
mind
but
quite
harmless
and
he
is
so
sad
and
lonely
so
dreadfully
sad
and
he
likes
me
to
sit
with
him
in
the
garden
and
tell
him
stories
and
recite
verses
to
him
poor
soul
just
as
if
he
were
a
child
do
you
know
and
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
me
to
be
a
little
comfort
to
him
in
his
lonely
wretched
life
and
james
steadman
says
i
must
go
near
him
because
he
may
change
at
any
moment
into
a
dangerous
lunatic
and
do
me
some
kind
of
harm
and
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
and
i
sure
he
wo
do
anything
of
the
kind
and
please
grandmother
tell
steadman
that
i
am
to
be
allowed
to
go
and
sit
with
his
poor
old
prisoner
half
an
hour
every
afternoon
carried
along
the
current
of
her
own
impetuous
thoughts
mary
had
talked
very
fast
and
had
not
once
looked
at
her
grandmother
while
she
was
speaking
but
now
at
the
end
of
her
speech
her
eyes
sought
lady
maulevrier
face
in
gentle
entreaty
and
she
recoiled
involuntarily
at
the
sight
she
saw
there
the
classic
features
were
distorted
almost
as
they
had
been
in
the
worst
period
of
the
paralytic
seizure
lady
maulevrier
was
ghastly
pale
and
her
eyes
glared
with
an
awful
fire
as
they
gazed
at
mary
her
whole
frame
was
convulsed
and
she
the
cripple
whose
right
limbs
lay
numbed
and
motionless
upon
the
couch
made
a
struggling
motion
as
she
raised
herself
a
little
with
the
left
arm
as
if
by
very
force
of
angry
will
she
would
have
lifted
herself
up
erect
before
the
girl
who
had
offended
her
for
a
few
moments
her
lips
moved
dumbly
and
there
was
something
unspeakably
awful
in
those
convulsed
features
that
livid
countenance
and
those
voiceless
syllables
trembling
upon
the
white
dry
lips
at
last
speech
came
you
were
created
to
torment
me
she
exclaimed
grandmother
what
harm
have
i
done
faltered
mary
harm
you
are
a
spy
your
very
existence
is
a
torment
and
a
danger
would
to
god
that
you
were
married
yes
married
to
a
even
and
out
of
my
way
that
is
your
only
difficulty
said
mary
haughtily
dare
say
hammond
would
be
kind
enough
to
marry
me
and
take
me
out
of
your
ladyship
way
lady
maulevrier
head
sank
back
upon
her
pillows
those
velvet
and
satin
pillows
rich
with
delicate
point
lace
and
adornment
the
labour
of
mary
and
fräulein
pillows
which
could
not
bring
peace
to
the
weary
head
or
deaden
the
tortures
of
memory
the
pale
face
recovered
its
wonted
calm
the
heavy
lips
drooped
over
the
weary
eyes
and
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
in
the
room
then
lady
maulevrier
raised
her
eyelids
and
looked
at
her
granddaughter
imploringly
pathetically
me
mary
she
said
do
know
what
i
was
saying
just
now
but
whatever
it
was
forgive
and
forget
it
i
am
a
wretched
old
woman
heart
sick
heart
sore
worn
out
by
pain
and
weariness
there
are
times
when
i
am
beside
myself
moments
when
i
am
not
much
saner
than
steadman
lunatic
uncle
this
is
one
of
my
worst
days
and
you
came
bouncing
in
upon
me
and
tortured
my
nerves
by
your
breathless
torrent
of
words
pray
forgive
me
if
i
said
anything
rude
thought
mary
but
she
tried
to
be
charitable
and
to
believe
that
lady
maulevrier
attack
upon
her
was
a
new
phase
of
hysteria
so
she
murmured
meekly
is
nothing
for
me
to
forgive
grandmother
and
i
am
very
sorry
i
disturbed
you
she
was
going
to
leave
the
room
thinking
that
her
absence
would
be
a
relief
to
the
invalid
when
lady
maulevrier
called
her
back
were
asking
me
something
something
about
that
old
man
of
steadman
she
said
with
a
weary
air
half
indifference
half
the
lassitude
natural
to
an
invalid
who
sinks
under
the
burden
of
monotonous
days
was
it
all
about
i
forget
mary
repeated
her
request
but
this
time
in
measured
tones
dear
i
am
sure
that
steadman
was
only
properly
prudent
answered
lady
maulevrier
that
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
interfere
in
this
matter
it
stands
to
reason
that
he
must
know
his
old
temperament
much
better
than
you
can
after
your
interviews
with
him
in
the
garden
pray
how
long
have
these
garden
scenes
been
going
on
asked
her
ladyship
with
a
searching
look
at
mary
downcast
face
the
girl
had
not
altogether
recovered
from
the
rude
shock
of
her
grandmother
late
attack
three
weeks
faltered
mary
it
is
more
than
a
week
now
since
i
was
in
the
garden
it
was
quite
by
accident
that
i
first
went
there
perhaps
i
ought
to
explain
and
mary
not
being
gainsayed
went
on
to
describe
that
first
afternoon
when
she
had
seen
the
old
man
brooding
in
the
sun
she
drew
quite
a
pathetic
picture
of
his
joyless
solitude
whilst
all
nature
around
and
about
him
was
looking
so
glad
in
the
spring
sunshine
there
was
a
long
silence
a
silence
of
some
minutes
when
she
had
done
and
lady
maulevrier
lay
with
lowered
eyelids
deep
in
thought
mary
began
to
hope
that
she
had
touched
her
grandmother
heart
and
that
her
request
would
be
granted
but
she
was
soon
undeceived
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
refuse
you
a
favour
mary
but
i
must
stand
by
steadman
said
her
ladyship
i
gave
steadman
permission
to
shelter
his
aged
kinsman
in
my
house
i
made
it
a
condition
that
the
old
man
should
be
kept
in
the
strictest
care
by
himself
and
his
wife
and
that
nobody
in
this
establishment
should
be
troubled
by
him
this
condition
has
been
so
scrupulously
adhered
to
that
the
old
existence
is
known
to
no
one
in
this
house
except
you
and
me
and
you
have
discovered
the
fact
only
by
accident
i
must
beg
you
to
keep
this
secret
to
yourself
steadman
has
particular
reasons
for
wishing
to
conceal
the
fact
of
his
uncle
residence
here
the
old
man
is
not
actually
a
lunatic
if
he
were
we
should
be
violating
the
law
by
keeping
him
here
he
is
only
imbecile
from
extreme
old
age
the
body
has
outlived
the
mind
that
is
all
but
should
any
officious
functionary
come
down
upon
fellside
this
imbecility
might
be
called
madness
and
the
poor
old
creature
whom
you
regard
so
compassionately
and
whose
case
you
think
so
pitiable
here
would
be
carried
off
to
a
pauper
lunatic
asylum
which
i
can
assure
you
would
be
a
much
worse
imprisonment
than
fellside
manor
indeed
grandmother
exclaimed
mary
whose
vivid
imagination
conjured
up
a
vision
of
padded
cells
keepers
chains
handcuffs
and
bread
and
water
diet
i
understand
why
the
poor
old
soul
has
been
kept
so
close
why
nobody
knows
of
his
existence
i
beg
steadman
pardon
with
all
my
heart
he
is
a
much
better
fellow
than
i
thought
him
is
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
and
as
true
as
steel
said
her
ladyship
one
can
know
that
so
well
as
the
mistress
he
has
served
faithfully
for
nearly
half
a
century
i
hope
mary
you
have
not
been
chattering
to
fräulein
or
any
one
else
about
your
discovery
grandmother
i
have
not
said
a
word
to
a
mortal
but
there
is
a
but
is
there
i
understand
you
have
not
been
so
reticent
in
your
letters
to
mr
hammond
tell
him
all
that
happens
to
me
there
is
very
little
to
write
about
at
fellside
yet
i
contrive
to
send
him
volumes
i
often
wonder
what
poor
girls
did
in
the
days
of
miss
austen
novels
when
letters
cost
a
shilling
or
eighteen
pence
for
postage
and
had
to
be
paid
for
by
the
recipient
it
must
have
been
such
a
terrible
check
upon
affection
upon
twaddle
said
lady
maulevrier
you
told
hammond
about
steadman
old
uncle
what
did
he
say
thoroughly
approved
steadman
conduct
in
forbidding
me
to
go
and
see
him
answered
mary
could
help
thinking
it
rather
unkind
of
him
but
of
course
i
feel
that
he
must
be
right
concluded
mary
as
much
as
to
say
that
her
lover
was
necessarily
infallible
always
thought
hammond
a
sensible
young
man
and
i
am
glad
to
find
that
his
conduct
does
not
belie
my
good
opinion
said
lady
maulevrier
now
my
dear
you
had
better
go
and
make
yourself
decent
before
dinner
i
am
very
weary
this
afternoon
and
even
our
little
talk
has
exhausted
me
dear
grandmother
i
am
going
this
instant
but
let
me
ask
one
question
what
is
the
poor
old
man
name
name
said
her
ladyship
looking
at
mary
with
a
puzzled
air
like
a
person
whose
thoughts
are
far
away
name
oh
steadman
i
suppose
like
his
nephew
but
if
i
ever
heard
the
name
i
have
forgotten
it
and
i
do
know
whether
the
kinship
is
on
the
father
or
the
mother
side
steadman
asked
my
permission
to
give
shelter
to
a
helpless
old
relative
and
i
gave
it
that
is
really
all
i
remember
one
other
question
pleaded
mary
who
was
brimful
of
curiosity
upon
this
particular
subject
he
been
at
fellside
very
long
i
really
do
know
a
year
or
two
or
three
perhaps
life
in
this
house
is
all
of
a
piece
i
hardly
keep
count
of
time
is
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
very
much
said
mary
still
lingering
near
her
grandmother
couch
the
balmy
evening
air
caressing
her
as
she
leaned
against
the
embrasure
of
the
wide
tudor
window
the
sun
drawing
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
hills
an
orb
of
yellow
flame
soon
to
change
to
a
gigantic
disk
of
lurid
fire
thought
from
the
old
man
talk
that
he
too
must
be
an
old
servant
in
our
family
he
talked
of
maulevrier
castle
and
said
that
i
reminded
him
of
a
picture
by
lely
a
portrait
of
a
lady
maulevrier
is
quite
possible
that
he
may
have
been
in
service
there
though
i
do
not
remember
to
have
heard
anything
about
it
answered
her
ladyship
carelessly
steadmans
come
from
that
part
of
the
country
and
theirs
is
a
hereditary
service
mary
i
am
utterly
weary
look
at
that
glorious
light
yonder
that
mighty
world
of
fire
and
flame
without
which
our
little
world
would
be
dark
and
dreary
i
often
think
of
that
speech
of
macbeth
i
to
be
aweary
of
the
sun
there
comes
a
time
mary
when
even
the
sun
is
a
burden
for
such
a
man
as
macbeth
said
mary
man
steeped
in
crime
who
can
wonder
that
he
wanted
to
hide
himself
from
the
sun
but
dear
grandmother
there
ought
to
be
plenty
of
happiness
left
for
you
even
if
your
recovery
is
slow
to
come
you
are
so
clever
you
have
such
resources
in
your
own
mind
and
memory
and
you
have
your
grandchildren
who
love
you
dearly
added
mary
tenderly
her
nature
was
so
full
of
pity
that
an
entirely
new
affection
had
grown
up
in
her
mind
for
lady
maulevrier
since
that
terrible
evening
of
the
paralytic
stroke
and
whose
love
as
exemplified
by
lesbia
is
shown
in
a
hurried
scrap
of
a
letter
scrawled
once
a
week
a
bone
thrown
to
a
hungry
dog
said
her
ladyship
bitterly
is
so
lovely
and
she
is
so
surrounded
by
flatterers
and
admirers
murmured
mary
excusingly
my
dear
if
she
had
a
heart
she
would
not
forget
me
even
in
the
midst
of
her
flatterers
again
mary
do
try
to
console
me
for
some
natures
consolations
and
soothing
suggestions
are
like
flowers
thrown
upon
a
granite
tomb
they
do
just
as
much
and
just
as
little
good
to
the
heart
that
lies
under
the
stone
mary
stooped
to
kiss
her
grandmother
forehead
and
found
it
cold
as
marble
she
murmured
a
loving
and
left
the
mistress
of
fellside
in
her
loneliness
a
footman
would
come
in
and
light
the
lamps
and
draw
the
velvet
curtains
presently
and
shut
out
the
later
glories
of
sunset
and
then
the
butler
himself
would
come
and
arrange
the
little
dinner
table
by
her
ladyship
couch
and
would
himself
preside
over
the
invalid
simple
dinner
which
would
be
served
exquisitely
with
all
that
is
daintiest
and
most
costly
in
salviati
glass
and
antique
silver
yet
better
the
dinner
of
herbs
and
love
and
peace
withal
than
the
choicest
fare
or
the
most
perfect
service
before
the
coming
of
the
servants
and
the
lamps
there
was
a
pause
of
silence
and
loneliness
an
interval
during
which
lady
maulevrier
lay
gazing
at
the
declining
orb
the
lower
rim
of
which
now
rested
on
the
edge
of
the
hill
it
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
more
dazzling
as
she
looked
at
it
suddenly
she
clasped
her
left
hand
across
her
eyes
and
said
aloud
what
a
hateful
life
almost
half
a
century
of
lies
and
hypocricies
and
prevarications
and
meannesses
for
what
for
the
glory
of
an
empty
name
and
for
a
fortune
that
may
slip
from
my
dead
hand
to
become
the
prey
of
rogues
and
adventurers
who
can
forecast
the
future

carte

lady
kirkbank
house
in
arlington
street
was
known
to
half
fashionable
london
as
one
of
the
pleasantest
houses
in
town
and
it
was
known
by
repute
only
to
the
other
half
of
fashionable
london
as
a
house
whose
threshold
was
not
to
be
crossed
by
persons
with
any
regard
for
their
own
dignity
and
reputation
it
was
not
that
lady
kirkbank
had
ever
actually
forfeited
her
right
to
be
considered
an
honest
woman
and
a
faithful
wife
people
who
talked
of
the
lady
and
her
set
with
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
dubious
elevation
of
the
eyebrows
were
ready
when
hard
pushed
in
argument
to
admit
that
they
knew
of
no
actual
harm
in
lady
kirkbank
no
overt
bad
behaviour
well
said
the
punctilious
half
of
society
the
pejinks
and
pernickitys
the
picksomes
and
kirkbank
is
lady
kirkbank
and
i
would
not
allow
my
girls
to
visit
her
do
you
know
kirkbank
is
received
certainly
said
a
severe
dowager
goes
to
very
good
houses
she
gets
tickets
for
the
royal
enclosure
she
is
always
at
private
views
and
privileged
shows
of
all
kinds
and
she
contrives
to
squeeze
herself
in
at
a
state
ball
or
a
concert
about
once
in
two
years
but
any
one
who
can
consider
lady
kirkbank
good
style
must
have
a
very
curious
idea
of
what
a
lady
ought
to
be
kirkbank
is
a
nice
creature
said
a
diplomatist
of
high
rank
and
one
of
her
particular
friends
her
manners
are
decidedly
continental
about
sir
george
society
adverse
or
friendly
was
without
strong
opinions
his
friends
the
men
who
shot
over
his
scotch
moor
and
filled
the
spare
rooms
in
his
villa
at
cannes
and
loaded
his
drag
for
sandown
or
epsom
and
sponged
upon
him
all
the
year
round
talked
of
him
as
inoffensive
old
party
cheery
soul
genial
old
boy
and
in
like
terms
of
approval
that
half
of
society
which
did
not
visit
in
arlington
street
in
whose
nostrils
the
altogether
bohemian
little
dinners
the
suppers
after
the
play
the
small
hours
devoted
to
nap
or
poker
had
an
odour
as
of
sulphur
the
reek
of
tophet
even
this
half
of
the
great
world
was
fain
to
admit
that
sir
george
was
harmless
he
had
never
had
an
idea
beyond
the
realms
of
sport
he
had
never
had
a
will
of
his
own
outside
his
stable
to
shoot
pigeons
at
hurlington
or
monaco
to
keep
half
a
dozen
and
attend
every
race
from
the
craven
to
the
leger
to
hunt
four
days
a
week
when
he
was
allowed
to
spend
a
winter
in
england
and
to
saunter
and
sleep
away
all
the
hours
which
could
not
be
given
to
sport
comprised
sir
george
idea
of
existence
he
had
never
troubled
himself
to
consider
whether
there
might
not
possibly
be
a
better
way
of
getting
rid
of
one
life
he
was
as
god
had
made
him
and
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
himself
and
the
universe
save
at
such
times
as
when
a
favourite
horse
went
lame
or
his
banker
wrote
to
tell
him
that
his
account
was
overdrawn
sir
george
had
no
children
he
had
never
had
a
serious
care
in
his
life
he
never
thought
he
never
read
lady
kirkbank
declared
that
she
had
never
seen
him
with
a
book
in
his
hands
since
their
marriage
do
believe
he
would
know
at
which
end
to
begin
she
said
what
was
the
specific
charge
which
the
very
particular
people
brought
against
lady
kirkbank
such
charges
rarely
specific
the
idea
that
the
lady
belonged
to
the
fast
and
furious
section
of
society
the
bohemia
of
the
upper
ten
was
an
idea
in
the
air
everybody
knew
it
no
one
could
quite
adequately
explain
it
from
thirty
to
fifty
lady
kirkbank
had
been
known
as
a
flirty
matron
wherever
she
went
a
train
of
men
went
with
her
men
young
and
and
elderly
handsome
youths
from
the
public

what
you
will
but
always
agreeable
at
home
abroad
lady
kirkbank
was
never
without
her
court
but
the
court
was
entirely
masculine
in
those
days
the
fair
georgie
did
not
scruple
to
say
that
she
hated
women
and
that
girls
were
her
particular
abomination
but
as
the
years
rolled
on
lady
kirkbank
began
to
find
it
very
difficult
to
muster
her
little
court
to
keep
her
train
in
attendance
upon
her
birds
were
wild
sir
george
said
her
young
adorers
found
their
official
duties
more
oppressive
than
hitherto
her
elderly
swains
had
threatenings
of
gout
or
rheumatism
which
prevented
their
flocking
round
her
as
of
old
at
race
meeting
or
polo
match
they
were
loyal
enough
in
keeping
their
engagements
at
the
dinner
table
for
lady
kirkbank
cook
was
one
of
the
best
in
london
and
the
invited
guests
were
rarely
missing
at
the
little
suppers
after
opera
or
play
but
georgia
box
was
no
longer
crowded
with
men
who
dropped
in
between
the
acts
to
see
what
she
thought
of
the
singer
or
the
piece
and
her
swains
were
no
longer
contented
to
sit
behind
her
chair
all
the
evening
seeing
an
empty
corner
of
the
stage
across
ivory
shoulder
and
hearing
the
voices
of
invisible
actors
in
the
brief
pauses
of
georgie
subdued
babble
at
georgina
kirkbank
told
herself
sadly
enough
that
her
day
as
a
bright
particular
star
in
her
own
radiance
was
gone
she
could
not
live
without
her
masculine
circle
men
who
could
bring
her
all
the
news
the
gossip
of
the
clubs
where
everything
seemed
to
become
known
as
quickly
as
if
each
club
had
its
own
asmodeus
unroofing
all
the
housetops
of
the
west
end
for
inspection
every
night
she
could
not
live
without
her
courtiers
and
to
keep
them
about
her
she
knew
that
she
must
make
her
house
pleasant
it
was
not
enough
to
give
good
dinners
elegant
little
suppers
washed
down
by
choicest
wines
she
must
also
provide
fair
faces
to
smile
upon
the
feast
and
bright
eyes
to
sparkle
in
the
subdued
light
of
low
shaded
lamps
and
many
candles
twinkling
under
coloured
shades
am
an
old
woman
now
lady
kirkbank
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
my
own
attractions
wo
keep
my
friends
about
me
trop
connu
and
now
the
house
in
arlington
street
in
which
feminine
guests
had
been
as
one
in
ten
opened
its
doors
to
the
young
and
the
fair
pretty
widows
lively
girls
young
wives
who
were
not
too
absurdly
devoted
to
their
husbands
actresses
of
high
standing
and
good
looks
these
began
to
be
welcomed
effusively
in
arlington
street
lady
kirkbank
began
to
hunt
for
beauties
to
adorn
her
rooms
as
she
had
hitherto
hunted
lions
to
roar
at
her
parties
she
prided
herself
on
being
the
first
to
discover
this
or
that
new
beauty
that
lovely
girl
from
scotland
with
the
large
eyes
that
sweet
young
creature
from
ireland
with
the
long
eyelashes
she
was
always
inventing
new
divinities
but
even
this
change
of
plan
this
more
feminine
line
of
politics
failed
to
reconcile
the
strict
and
the
stern
the
queen
elderly
ladies
and
the
impeccable
matrons
to
lady
kirkbank
and
her
set
the
girls
who
were
launched
by
lady
kirkbank
never
took
high
rank
in
society
when
they
made
good
marriages
it
was
generally
to
be
observed
that
they
dropped
lady
kirkbank
soon
afterwards
it
was
not
their
fault
these
ingrates
pleaded
piteously
but
edward
or
henry
or
theodore
as
the
case
might
be
had
a
most
cruel
prejudice
against
dear
lady
kirkbank
and
the
young
wives
were
obliged
to
obey
others
there
were
however
the
loyal
few
who
having
won
the
prize
matrimonial
in
lady
kirkbank
happy
hunting
grounds
remained
true
to
their
friend
ever
afterwards
and
defended
her
character
against
every
onslaught
when
lady
maulevrier
told
her
grandson
that
she
had
entrusted
lady
kirkbank
with
the
duty
of
introducing
lesbia
to
society
maulevrier
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
held
his
peace
he
knew
no
actual
harm
in
the
matter
lady
kirkbank
was
rather
a
fast
set
and
had
he
been
allowed
to
choose
it
was
not
to
lady
kirkbank
that
he
would
have
delegated
his
grandmother
duty
in
maulevrier
own
phrase
it
was
good
for
lesbia
but
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
interfere
he
was
not
told
of
the
plan
until
everything
had
been
settled
the
thing
was
accomplished
and
against
accomplished
facts
maulevrier
was
the
last
to
protest
his
friend
john
hammond
had
not
been
silent
he
knew
nothing
of
lady
kirkbank
personally
but
he
knew
the
position
which
she
held
in
london
society
and
he
urged
his
friend
strongly
to
enlighten
lady
maulevrier
as
to
the
kind
of
circle
into
which
she
was
about
to
entrust
her
young
granddaughter
a
girl
brought
up
in
the
arcadia
of
england
for
worlds
would
i
undertake
such
a
task
said
maulevrier
ladyship
never
had
any
opinion
of
my
wisdom
and
this
lady
kirkbank
is
a
friend
of
her
own
youth
she
would
cut
up
rough
if
i
were
to
say
a
word
against
an
old
friend
besides
what
the
odds
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
all
society
is
fast
nowadays
or
at
any
rate
all
society
worth
living
in
and
then
again
lesbia
is
just
one
of
those
girls
who
would
keep
herself
head
uppermost
in
a
maelstrom
she
knows
on
which
side
her
bread
is
buttered
look
how
easily
she
chucked
you
up
because
she
did
not
think
you
good
enough
she
make
use
of
this
lady
kirkbank
who
is
a
good
soul
i
am
told
and
will
make
the
best
match
of
the
season
and
now
the
season
had
begun
and
lady
lesbia
haselden
was
circulating
with
other
aristocratic
atoms
in
the
social
vortex
with
her
head
apparently
uppermost
lady
k
has
nobbled
a
real
beauty
this
time
said
one
of
the
arlington
street
set
to
his
friend
as
they
lolled
on
the
railings
in
the
park
long
way
above
any
of
those
ones
she
tried
to
palm
off
upon
us
last
year
the
south
american
girl
with
the
big
eyes
and
a
complexion
like
a
toad
the
forfarshire
girl
with
freckles
and
unsophisticated
carrots
those
lovely
spanish
eyes
said
lady
k
that
titianesque
auburn
hair
but
it
did
answer
both
the
girls
were
plain
and
they
have
gone
back
to
their
native
obscurity
spinsters
still
but
this
is
a
real
one
blood
form
pace
all
there
is
she
drawled
his
friend
maulevrier
sister
lady
lesbia
haselden
has
money
too
i
believe
rich
grandmother
old
lady
buried
alive
in
westmoreland
horrid
old
miser
should
mind
marrying
a
miser
granddaughter
said
the
other
nice
to
know
that
some
wretched
old
idiot
has
scraped
and
hoarded
through
a
lifetime
of
deprivation
and
in
order
that
one
may
spend
his
money
when
he
is
under
the
sod
lady
lesbia
was
accepted
everywhere
or
almost
everywhere
as
the
beauty
of
the
season
there
were
six
or
seven
other
girls
who
aspired
to
the
same
proud
position
who
were
asserted
by
their
own
particular
friends
to
have
won
it
just
as
there
are
generally
four
or
five
horses
which
claim
to
be
first
favourites
but
the
betting
was
all
in
favour
of
lady
lesbia
lady
kirkbank
told
her
that
she
was
turning
everyone
head
and
lesbia
was
quite
willing
to
believe
her
but
was
lesbia
own
head
quite
steady
in
this
whirlpool
that
was
a
question
which
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
ask
herself
her
heart
was
tranquil
enough
cold
as
marble
no
shield
and
safeguard
so
secure
against
the
fire
of
new
love
as
an
old
love
hardly
cold
lesbia
told
herself
that
her
heart
was
a
sepulchre
an
urn
which
held
a
handful
of
ashes
the
ashes
of
her
passion
for
john
hammond
it
was
a
fire
quite
burned
out
she
thought
but
that
extinguished
flame
had
left
coldness
this
was
lesbia
own
diagnosis
of
her
case
but
the
real
truth
was
that
among
the
herd
of
men
she
had
met
almost
all
of
them
ready
to
fall
down
and
worship
her
there
was
not
one
who
had
caught
her
fancy
her
nature
was
shallow
enough
to
be
passing
fickle
the
passion
which
she
had
taken
for
love
was
little
more
than
a
girl
fancy
but
the
man
who
had
power
to
awaken
that
fancy
as
john
hammond
had
done
had
not
yet
appeared
in
lady
kirkbank
circle
a
creature
you
must
be
said
georgie
seem
to
admire
any
of
my
favourite
men
are
very
nice
lesbia
answered
languidly
they
are
all
alike
they
say
the
same
things
wear
the
same
clothes
sit
in
the
same
attitude
one
would
think
they
were
all
drilled
in
a
body
every
morning
before
they
go
out
nightshade
the
actor
who
came
to
supper
the
other
night
is
the
only
man
i
have
seen
who
has
a
spark
of
originality
are
right
answered
lady
kirkbank
is
an
appalling
sameness
in
men
only
it
is
odd
you
should
find
it
out
so
soon
i
never
discovered
it
till
i
was
an
old
woman
how
i
envy
cleopatra
her
cæsar
and
her
antony
no
mistaking
one
of
those
for
the
other
mary
stuart
too
what
marked
varieties
of
character
she
had
an
opportunity
of
studying
in
rizzio
and
chastelard
darnley
and
bothwell
ah
child
that
is
what
it
is
to
is
very
interesting
sighed
lesbia
i
fear
she
was
not
a
correct
person
love
what
correct
person
ever
is
interesting
history
draws
a
misty
halo
round
a
sinner
of
that
kind
till
one
almost
believes
her
a
saint
i
think
mary
stuart
froude
mary
simply
perfect
lesbia
had
begun
by
blushing
at
lady
kirkbank
opinions
but
she
was
now
used
to
the
audacity
of
the
lady
sentiments
and
the
almost
infantile
candour
with
which
she
gave
utterance
to
them
lady
kirkbank
liked
to
make
her
friends
laugh
it
was
all
she
could
do
now
in
order
to
be
admired
and
there
is
nothing
like
audacity
for
making
people
laugh
nowadays
lady
kirkbank
was
a
close
student
of
all
those
delightful
books
of
french
memoirs
which
bring
the
of
the
regency
and
the
scandals
of
louis
the
fifteenth
reign
so
vividly
before
us
and
she
had
unconsciously
founded
her
manners
and
her
ways
of
thinking
and
talking
upon
that
but
elegant
age
she
did
not
want
to
seem
better
than
women
who
had
been
so
altogether
charming
she
fortified
the
frivolity
of
historical
parisian
manners
by
a
dash
of
the
british
sporting
character
she
drove
shot
jumped
over
gates
contrived
on
the
verge
of
seventy
to
be
as
active
us
a
young
woman
and
she
flattered
herself
that
the
mixture
of
wit
audacity
sport
and
was
full
of
fascination
however
this
might
be
it
is
certain
that
a
good
many
people
liked
her
chiefly
perhaps
because
she
was
and
a
little
on
account
of
that
admirable
cook
to
lesbia
who
had
been
weary
to
loathing
of
her
old
life
amidst
the
hills
and
waterfalls
of
westmoreland
this
new
life
was
one
perpetual
round
of
pleasure
she
flung
herself
with
all
her
heart
and
mind
into
the
amusement
of
the
moment
she
knew
neither
weariness
nor
satiety
to
ride
in
the
park
in
the
morning
to
go
to
a
luncheon
party
a
garden
party
to
drive
in
the
park
for
half
an
hour
after
the
garden
party
to
rush
home
and
dress
for
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
and
then
off
to
a
dinner
and
from
dinner
to
drum
and
from
drum
to
big
ball
at
which
rumour
said
the
prince
and
princess
were
to
be
present
and
so
from
eleven
in
the
morning
till
four
or
five
next
morning
the
giddy
whirl
went
on
and
every
hour
was
so
occupied
by
pleasure
engagements
that
it
was
difficult
to
squeeze
in
an
occasional
morning
for
shopping
necessary
to
go
to
the
shops
sometimes
or
one
would
not
know
how
many
things
one
really
wants
or
for
an
indispensable
interview
with
the
dressmaker
those
mornings
at
the
shops
were
hardly
the
least
agreeable
of
lesbia
hours
to
a
girl
brought
up
in
one
perpetual
with
green
and
silvery
watercourses
the
west
end
shops
were
as
gardens
of
eden
as
aladdin
caves
as
anything
everything
that
is
rapturous
and
intoxicating
lesbia
the
the
fairly
lost
her
senses
when
she
went
into
one
of
those
exquisite
shops
where
a
confusion
of
brocades
and
satins
lay
about
in
dazzling
masses
of
richest
colour
with
here
and
there
a
bunch
of
lilies
a
cluster
of
roses
a
fan
an
ostrich
feather
or
a
flounce
of
peerless
point
flung
carelessly
athwart
the
sheen
of
a
velvet
or
satin
lady
maulevrier
had
said
lesbia
was
to
have
so
lesbia
bought
everything
she
wanted
or
fancied
she
wanted
or
that
the
thought
she
must
want
or
that
lady
kirkbank
happened
to
admire
the
were
so
obliging
and
so
deeply
obliged
by
lesbia
patronage
she
was
exactly
the
kind
of
customer
they
liked
to
serve
she
flitted
about
their
showrooms
like
a
beautiful
butterfly
hovering
over
a
her
eye
caught
by
every
novelty
she
never
asked
the
price
of
anything
and
lady
kirkbank
informed
them
in
confidence
that
she
was
a
great
heiress
with
a
millionaire
grandmother
who
indulged
her
every
whim
other
high
born
young
ladies
shopping
upon
fixed
allowances
and
sorely
perplexed
to
make
both
ends
meet
looked
with
eyes
of
envy
upon
this
girl
and
then
came
the
visit
to
the
dressmaker
it
happened
after
all
that
kate
kearney
was
not
intrusted
with
lady
lesbia
frocks
miss
kearney
was
the
fashion
and
could
pick
and
choose
her
customers
and
as
she
was
a
young
lady
of
good
business
aptitudes
she
had
a
liking
for
ready
money
or
at
least
settlements
and
finding
that
lady
kirkbank
was
much
more
willing
to
give
new
orders
than
to
pay
old
accounts
she
had
respectfully
informed
her
ladyship
that
a
pressure
of
business
would
prevent
her
executing
any
further
demands
from
arlington
street
while
the
necessity
of
posting
her
ledger
obliged
her
to
request
the
favour
of
an
immediate
cheque
the
little
skirmish
per
letter
occurred
while
lady
kirkbank
was
at
cannes
and
miss
kearney
conduct
was
stigmatised
as
insolent
and
ungrateful
since
had
not
she
lady
kirkbank
by
the
mere
fact
of
her
patronage
given
this
young
person
her
chief
claim
to
fashion
shall
drop
her
said
georgie
go
back
to
poor
old
seraphine
who
is
worth
a
cartload
of
such
irish
adventuresses
so
to
madame
seraphine
of
clanricarde
place
lady
lesbia
was
taken
as
a
lamb
to
the
seraphine
had
made
lady
kirkbank
clothes
off
and
on
for
the
last
thirty
years
seraphine
and
georgia
had
grown
old
together
lady
kirkbank
was
always
dropping
seraphine
and
taking
her
up
again
quarrelling
and
making
friends
with
her
they
wrote
each
other
little
notes
in
which
lady
kirkbank
called
the
dressmaker
her
her
her
vielle
and
all
manner
of
affectionate
names
and
in
which
seraphine
occasionally
threatened
the
lady
with
the
dire
engines
of
the
law
if
money
were
not
forthcoming
before
saturday
evening
lady
kirkbank
within
those
thirty
years
had
paid
seraphine
many
thousands
but
she
had
never
once
got
herself
out
of
the
dear
debt
all
her
payments
were
payments
on
account
a
hundred
pounds
or
fifty
or
an
occasional
cheque
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
when
sir
george
had
been
lucky
at
newmarket
and
doncaster
but
the
rolling
nucleus
of
debt
went
rolling
on
growing
bigger
every
year
until
the
payments
on
account
needed
to
be
larger
or
more
numerous
than
of
old
to
keep
seraphine
in
good
humour
seraphine
was
a
woman
of
genius
and
versatility
and
had
more
than
one
art
at
her
fingers
ends
those
skinny
and
fingers
the
nails
whereof
were
not
always
clean
she
took
charge
of
her
figures
and
made
their
corsets
and
lectured
them
if
they
allowed
nature
to
get
the
upper
hand
madame
waist
gets
one
quarter
of
an
inch
thicker
it
must
be
that
i
renounce
to
make
her
gowns
she
would
tell
a
ponderous
matron
with
cool
insolence
and
the
matron
would
stand
abashed
before
the
little
sallow
keen
eyed
jewess
like
a
child
before
a
severe
mother
seraphine
do
you
really
think
that
i
am
stouter
the
customer
would
ask
feebly
panting
in
her
tightened
corset
it
that
i
think
so
why
that
jumps
to
the
eyes
madame
had
always
that
little
air
of
rubens
even
in
the
flower
of
her
youth
but
now
it
is
a
rubens
of
the
faubourg
du
temple
and
horrified
at
the
idea
of
her
vulgarised
charms
the
meek
matron
would
consent
to
encase
herself
in
one
of
seraphine
severest
corsets
called
in
bitterest
mockery
la
at
five
guineas
in
order
that
the
dressmaker
might
measure
her
for
a
gown
plain
satin
gown
my
dear
with
an
eighteenpenny
frilling
round
the
neck
and
sleeves
and
not
so
much
trimming
as
would
go
round
my
little
finger
it
is
positive
robbery
the
matron
told
her
friends
afterwards
not
the
less
proud
of
her
high
shouldered
sleeves
and
the
peerless
flow
of
her
train
seraphine
was
an
artist
in
complexions
and
it
was
she
who
provided
her
and
elderly
customers
with
the
lilies
and
roses
of
youth
lady
kirkbank
town
complexion
was
superintended
by
seraphine
sometimes
even
manipulated
by
those
claws
the
eyebrows
of
which
lesbia
complained
were
only
eyebrows
eyebrows
in
london
georgie
was
much
more
particular
and
seraphine
was
often
in
arlington
street
with
her
little
morocco
bag
of
washes
and
creams
and
brushes
and
sponges
to
prepare
lady
kirkbank
for
some
great
party
and
to
instruct
lady
kirkbank
maid
at
such
times
georgie
was
all
affection
for
the
little
dressmaker
you
have
made
me
positively
adorable
she
would
say
peering
at
her
reflection
in
the
ivory
a
dazzling
image
of
rouge
and
bismuth
carmined
lips
diamonds
and
frizzy
yellow
hair
verily
believe
i
look
under
thirty
but
do
not
you
think
this
gown
is
a
thought
too
un
peu
trop
de
peau
hein
for
you
lady
kirkbank
with
your
fine
shoulders
shoulders
are
of
no
age
épaules
sont
la
vraie
fontaine
de
jouvence
pour
les
jolies
are
such
a
witty
creature
seraphine
fifine
you
ought
to
be
a
descendant
of
that
wicked
old
madame
du
deffand
rilboche
give
madame
some
more
chartreuse
and
lady
kirkbank
and
the
dressmaker
would
chink
their
liqueur
glasses
in
amity
before
the
lady
gathered
up
her
satin
train
and
allowed
her
peerless
shoulders
to
be
muffled
in
a
plush
mantle
to
go
down
to
her
carriage
fortified
by
that
last
glass
of
green
chartreuse
there
were
always
the
finest
chartreuse
and
curaçoa
in
a
liqueur
cabinet
on
lady
kirkbank
the
cabinet
formed
a
companion
to
the
which
contained
all
those
creamy
and
cosmetics
powders
brushes
and
medicaments
which
were
necessary
for
the
manufacture
of
georgie
complexion
the
third
bottle
in
the
liqueur
case
held
cognac
and
this
as
rilboche
the
maid
knew
was
oftenest
replenished
yet
nobody
could
accuse
lady
kirkbank
of
intemperate
habits
the
liqueur
box
only
supplied
the
peg
that
was
occasionally
wanted
to
screw
the
superior
mind
to
concert
pitch
must
always
be
at
concert
pitch
in
society
do
you
know
my
dear
said
georgie
to
her
young
protégée
thus
it
happened
that
miss
kearney
having
behaved
badly
lesbia
was
carried
off
to
dear
old
seraphine
and
delivered
over
to
that
modern
witch
as
a
sacrifice
tied
to
the
horns
of
the
altar
clanricarde
place
is
a
little
nook
of
queen
anne
houses
genuine
queen
anne
be
it
understood
between
piccadilly
and
james
palace
and
hardly
five
minutes
walk
from
arlington
street
it
is
a
quiet
little
de
in
the
very
heart
of
the
fashionable
world
and
here
of
an
afternoon
might
be
seen
the
carriages
of
madame
seraphine
customers
blocking
the
whole
of
the
carriage
way
and
choking
up
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
street
which
widened
considerably
at
the
inner
end
madame
seraphine
house
was
at
the
end
a
narrow
house
with
tall
windows
curtained
with
amber
satin
it
was
a
small
dark
house
and
exhaled
occasional
odours
of
garlic
and
main
sewer
but
the
staircase
was
a
gem
in
old
oak
and
the
furniture
in
the
triple
telescopic
drawing
rooms
dwindling
to
a
closet
at
the
end
was
genuine
louis
seize
seraphine
herself
was
the
only
shabby
thing
in
the
house
a
wizened
little
woman
with
a
wicked
old
jewish
face
and
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
dressed
in
a
shiny
black
moire
gown
years
after
moires
had
been
exploded
and
with
a
rag
of
old
lace
upon
her
sleek
black
hair
raven
black
hair
and
the
only
good
thing
about
her
appearance
one
ornament
and
one
only
had
seraphine
ever
been
guilty
of
wearing
and
that
was
an
ring
of
brazilian
diamonds
brilliants
of
the
first
water
this
ring
she
called
her
yard
measure
and
she
was
in
the
habit
of
using
it
as
her
standard
of
purity
and
comparing
it
with
any
diamonds
which
her
customers
submitted
to
her
inspection
for
the
clever
little
dressmaker
had
a
feeling
heart
for
a
lady
in
difficulties
and
was
in
the
habit
of
lending
money
on
good
security
and
on
terms
that
were
almost
reasonable
as
compared
with
the
usurious
rates
one
reads
of
in
the
newspapers
lesbia
first
sensation
upon
having
this
accomplished
person
presented
to
her
was
one
of
shrinking
and
disgust
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
sallow
face
the
small
shrewd
eyes
and
long
hooked
nose
the
crooked
figure
and
hands
but
when
madame
seraphine
began
to
talk
about
gowns
and
bade
her
acolytes
young
women
with
pleasing
countenances
bring
forth
marvels
of
brocade
and
satin
embroideries
stamped
velvets
bullion
fringes
and
ostrich
feather
flouncings
lesbia
became
interested
and
forgot
the
unholy
aspect
of
the
high
priestess
lady
kirkbank
and
the
dressmaker
discussed
lesbia
charms
as
calmly
as
if
she
had
been
out
of
the
room
do
you
think
of
her
figure
asked
lady
kirkbank
can
not
criticise
what
does
not
exist
replied
the
dressmaker
in
french
young
lady
has
no
figure
she
has
evidently
been
brought
up
in
the
country
and
then
with
rapid
movements
and
with
her
head
on
one
side
seraphine
measured
lesbia
waist
and
bust
muttering
little
argotic
expressions
as
she
did
so
three
inches
too
large
shoulders
six
inches
too
narrow
she
said
decisively
and
she
dictated
some
figures
to
one
of
the
damsels
who
wrote
them
down
in
an
does
that
mean
asked
lesbia
not
at
all
approving
of
such
cavalier
treatment
that
seraphine
will
make
your
corsets
the
right
size
answered
lady
kirkbank
three
inches
too
small
for
my
waist
and
six
too
wide
for
my
shoulders
love
you
must
have
a
figure
replied
lady
kirkbank
conclusively
is
not
what
you
are
but
what
you
ought
to
be
that
has
to
be
considered
so
lesbia
the
who
was
also
the
consented
to
have
her
figure
adjusted
to
the
regulation
mark
of
absolute
beauty
as
understood
by
madame
seraphine
it
was
only
when
her
complexion
came
under
discussion
and
seraphine
ventured
to
suggest
that
she
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
little
accentuation
of
her
eyebrows
and
darkening
of
her
lashes
that
lesbia
made
a
stand
would
my
grandmother
think
of
me
if
she
heard
i
painted
she
asked
indignantly
lady
kirkbank
laughed
at
her
dear
child
your
grandmother
is
just
half
a
century
behind
the
age
she
said
hope
you
are
not
going
to
allow
your
life
in
london
to
be
regulated
by
an
oracle
at
grasmere
am
not
going
to
paint
my
face
replied
lesbia
firmly
perhaps
you
are
right
the
eyebrows
are
a
little
weak
and
undecided
seraphine
as
you
say
and
the
lashes
would
be
all
the
better
for
your
famous
cosmetic
but
after
all
there
is
a
charm
in
what
the
painters
call
sincerity
and
any
little
errors
of
detail
will
prove
the
genuineness
of
lady
lesbia
beauty
one
be
too
artistic
and
lady
kirkbank
gave
a
complacent
glance
at
her
own
image
in
one
of
the
marie
antoinette
mirrors
pleased
with
the
general
effect
of
arched
brows
darkened
eyelids
and
a
daisy
bonnet
the
fair
georgie
generally
affected
and
other
simplicities
which
would
have
been
becoming
to
a
beauty
of
eighteen
is
obliged
to
smother
one
self
in
satin
and
velvet
for
balls
and
dinners
said
lady
kirkbank
when
she
discussed
the
great
question
of
gowns
i
know
i
always
look
my
best
in
my
cotton
frock
and
straw
hat
that
first
visit
to
seraphine
den
den
as
terrible
did
one
but
know
it
as
that
antediluvian
at
torquay
where
the
threshold
is
worn
by
the
bodies
of
beasts
dragged
across
it
and
the
ground
paved
with
their
bones
that
first
visit
was
a
serious
business
later
interviews
might
be
mere
frivolities
wasted
in
looking
at
new
fashions
an
order
given
carelessly
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
but
upon
this
occasion
lady
kirkbank
had
to
arm
her
young
for
the
coming
campaign
and
the
question
was
to
the
last
degree
serious
the
chaperon
and
the
dressmaker
put
their
heads
together
looked
at
fashion
plates
talked
solemnly
of
worth
and
his
compeers
of
the
gowns
that
were
being
worn
by
bernhardt
and
pierson
and
croisette
and
other
stars
of
the
parisian
stage
and
then
lady
kirkbank
gave
her
orders
lesbia
listening
and
assenting
nothing
was
said
about
prices
but
lesbia
had
a
vague
idea
that
some
of
the
things
would
be
rather
expensive
and
she
ventured
to
ask
lady
kirkbank
if
she
were
not
ordering
too
many
gowns
dear
lady
maulevrier
said
you
were
to
have
replied
georgie
solemnly
dear
grandmother
is
as
rich
as
croesus
and
she
is
generosity
itself
and
how
should
i
ever
forgive
myself
if
i
allowed
you
to
appear
in
society
in
an
inadequate
style
you
have
to
take
a
high
place
the
very
highest
place
lesbia
and
you
must
be
dressed
in
accordance
with
that
position
lesbia
said
no
more
after
all
it
was
lady
kirkbank
business
and
not
hers
see
had
been
entrusted
to
lady
kirkbank
as
to
a
person
who
thoroughly
knew
the
great
world
and
she
must
submit
to
be
governed
by
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
her
chaperon
if
the
bills
were
heavy
that
would
be
lady
kirkbank
affair
and
no
doubt
dear
grandmother
was
rich
enough
to
afford
anything
lesbia
wanted
she
had
been
told
that
she
was
to
take
rank
among
heiresses
lady
maulevrier
had
given
her
granddaughter
some
ornaments
topaz
amethysts
turquoise
jewels
that
had
belonged
to
dead
and
gone
talmashes
and
angersthorpes
to
be
reset
this
entailed
a
visit
to
a
bond
street
jeweller
and
in
the
dazzling
on
the
counter
of
the
bond
street
establishment
lesbia
saw
a
good
many
things
which
she
felt
were
real
necessities
to
her
new
phase
of
existence
and
these
with
lady
kirkbank
approval
she
ordered
they
were
not
important
matters
gold
bangles
of
real
oriental
workmanship
three
or
four
jewelled
arrows
flies
and
beetles
and
caterpillars
to
pin
on
her
laces
and
flowers
a
diamond
clasp
for
her
pearl
necklace
a
dear
little
gold
hunter
to
wear
when
she
rode
in
the
park
a
diamond
butterfly
to
light
up
that
amethyst
which
the
jeweller
was
to
reset
with
an
artistic
admixture
of
brilliants
am
sure
you
would
not
like
the
effect
without
diamonds
said
the
jeweller
amethysts
are
very
fine
but
they
are
dark
and
heavy
in
tone
and
want
a
good
deal
of
especially
for
the
present
fashion
of
rooms
if
you
will
allow
me
to
use
my
own
discretion
and
mix
in
a
few
brilliants
i
shall
be
able
to
produce
a
really
artistic
otherwise
i
would
not
recommend
you
to
touch
them
the
present
setting
is
clumsy
and
inelegant
but
i
really
do
not
know
that
i
could
improve
upon
it
without
an
admixture
of
brilliants
the
diamonds
add
very
much
to
the
expense
lesbia
inquired
timidly
dear
child
you
are
perfectly
safe
in
leaving
the
matter
in
cabochon
hands
interposed
lady
kirkbank
who
had
particular
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
head
of
the
establishment
dear
grandmother
gave
you
the
amethysts
to
be
reset
and
of
course
she
would
wish
it
to
be
done
in
an
artistic
manner
otherwise
as
cabochon
judiciously
says
why
have
the
stones
reset
at
all
better
wear
them
in
all
their
present
hideousness
of
course
after
this
lesbia
consented
to
the
amethysts
being
dealt
with
according
to
cabochon
taste
is
simply
perfect
interjected
lady
kirkbank
and
now
lesbia
campaign
began
in
real
earnest
a
life
of
pleasure
a
life
of
utter
selfishness
and
which
would
go
far
to
pervert
the
strongest
mind
tarnish
the
purest
nature
to
dress
and
be
admired
that
was
what
lesbia
life
meant
from
morning
till
night
she
had
no
higher
or
nobler
aim
even
on
sunday
mornings
at
the
fashionable
church
where
the
women
sat
on
one
side
of
the
nave
and
the
men
on
the
other
where
divinest
music
was
as
a
pair
of
wings
on
which
the
enraptured
soul
flew
heavenward
even
here
lesbia
thought
more
of
her
bonnet
and
gloves
the
or
of
her
whole
costume
than
of
the
service
she
might
kneel
gracefully
with
her
bent
head
just
revealing
the
ivory
whiteness
of
a
lovely
throat
between
the
edge
of
her
lace
frilling
and
the
flowers
in
her
bonnet
she
might
look
the
fairest
image
of
devotion
but
how
could
a
woman
pray
whose
heart
was
a
milliner
shop
whose
highest
ambition
was
to
be
prettier
and
better
dressed
than
other
women
the
season
was
six
weeks
old
it
was
ascot
week
the
crowning
glory
of
the
year
and
lesbia
and
her
chaperon
had
secured
tickets
for
the
royal
enclosure
or
it
may
be
said
rather
that
lesbia
had
secured
them
for
the
master
of
the
royal
buckhounds
might
have
omitted
poor
old
lady
kirkbank
familiar
name
from
his
list
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
lovely
girl
who
went
everywhere
under
the
veteran
wing
six
weeks
and
lesbia
appearance
in
society
had
been
one
perpetual
triumph
but
as
yet
nothing
serious
had
happened
she
had
had
no
offers
half
a
dozen
men
had
tried
their
hardest
to
propose
to
her
had
sat
out
dances
had
waylaid
her
in
conservatories
and
in
back
in
lobbies
while
she
waited
for
her
carriage
had
looked
at
her
piteously
with
tenderest
declarations
trembling
on
their
lips
but
she
had
contrived
to
keep
them
at
bay
to
strike
them
dumb
by
her
coldness
or
confound
them
by
her
coquetry
for
all
these
were
ineligibles
whom
lady
lesbia
haselden
did
not
want
to
have
the
trouble
of
refusing
lady
kirkbank
was
in
no
haste
to
marry
her
nay
it
was
much
more
to
her
interest
that
lesbia
should
remain
single
for
three
or
four
seasons
and
that
she
lady
kirkbank
might
have
the
advantage
of
close
association
with
the
young
beauty
and
the
privilege
of
spending
lady
maulevrier
money
but
she
would
have
liked
to
be
able
to
inform
lesbia
grandmother
of
some
tremendous
conquest
the
subjugation
of
a
worthy
victim
this
herd
of
nobodies
younger
sons
with
courtesy
titles
and
empty
pockets
ruined
guardsmen
briefless
barristers
what
was
the
use
of
telling
lady
maulevrier
about
such
barren
victories
lady
kirkbank
therefore
contented
herself
with
expatiating
upon
triumphs
in
a
general
way
how
graciously
the
princess
spoke
to
her
and
about
her
how
she
had
been
asked
to
sit
on
the
dais
at
the
ball
at
marlborough
house
and
had
danced
in
the
royal
quadrille
lesbia
happened
to
meet
lord
hartfield
lady
maulevrier
asked
incidentally
in
one
of
her
letters
no
lord
hartfield
was
in
london
for
he
had
made
a
great
speech
in
the
lords
on
a
question
of
vital
interest
but
he
was
not
going
into
society
or
at
any
rate
into
society
of
a
frivolous
kind
he
had
given
himself
up
to
politics
as
so
many
young
men
did
nowadays
which
was
altogether
horrid
of
them
his
name
had
appeared
in
the
list
of
guests
at
one
or
two
cabinet
dinners
but
the
world
of
polo
matches
and
afternoon
teas
dances
and
drums
private
theatricals
and
orleans
house
suppers
knew
him
not
as
a
competitor
on
the
fashionable
lord
hartfield
was
in
common
parlance
out
of
the
running
and
now
on
this
glorious
june
day
this
thursday
of
thursdays
the
ascot
cup
day
for
the
first
time
since
lesbia
début
lady
kirkbank
had
occasion
to
smile
upon
an
admirer
whose
pretensions
were
worthy
of
the
highest
consideration
smithson
of
park
lane
and
rood
hall
near
henley
and
formosa
cowes
and
le
bouge
deauville
and
a
good
many
other
places
too
numerous
to
mention
was
reputed
to
be
one
of
the
richest
commoners
in
england
he
was
a
man
of
that
uncertain
period
of
life
which
enemies
call
middle
age
and
friends
call
youth
that
he
would
never
see
a
birthday
again
was
certain
but
whether
he
had
passed
the
rubicon
of
forty
was
open
to
doubt
it
is
possible
that
he
was
enjoying
those
few
golden
years
between
and
forty
which
for
the
wealthy
bachelor
constitute
verily
the
prime
and
of
life
wisdom
has
come
experience
has
been
bought
taste
has
been
cultivated
the
man
has
educated
himself
to
the
uttermost
in
the
great
school
of
daily
life
he
knows
his
world
thoroughly
whatever
that
world
is
and
he
knows
how
to
enjoy
every
gift
and
every
advantage
which
providence
has
bestowed
upon
him
smithson
was
a
great
authority
on
the
stock
exchange
though
he
had
ceased
for
the
last
three
or
four
years
to
frequent
the
or
to
be
seen
in
the
purlieus
of
throgmorton
street
indeed
he
had
an
air
of
hardly
knowing
his
way
to
the
city
of
being
acquainted
with
that
part
of
london
only
by
hearsay
he
complained
that
his
horses
shied
at
passing
temple
bar
and
yet
a
few
years
ago
smithson
city
operations
had
been
on
a
very
extensive
scale
it
was
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
commodities
rather
than
of
stocks
and
shares
that
horace
smithson
had
made
his
money
he
had
exercised
occult
influences
upon
the
trade
of
the
great
city
of
the
world
itself
whereof
that
city
is
in
a
manner
the
keystone
iron
had
risen
or
fallen
at
his
beck
at
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
cochineal
had
gone
up
in
the
market
at
an
almost
magical
rate
as
if
the
whole
civilised
world
had
become
suddenly
intent
upon
dyeing
its
garments
red
nay
as
if
even
the
naked
savages
of
the
gold
coast
and
the
tribes
of
central
africa
were
bent
on
staining
their
dusky
skins
with
the
bodies
of
the
female
coccus
favoured
by
a
hint
from
smithson
his
particular
friends
followed
his
lead
and
rushed
into
the
markets
to
buy
all
the
cochineal
that
could
be
had
to
buy
at
any
price
since
the
market
was
rising
hourly
and
then
all
in
a
moment
as
the
sky
clouds
over
on
a
summer
day
there
came
a
dulness
in
the
cochineal
market
and
the
female
coccus
was
being
sold
at
an
enormous
sacrifice
and
anon
it
leaked
out
that
smithson
had
grown
tired
of
cochineal
and
had
been
selling
for
the
last
week
or
two
and
it
was
noised
abroad
that
this
rise
and
fall
in
cocci
had
brought
smithson
seventy
thousand
pounds
smithson
was
said
to
have
commenced
life
in
a
very
humble
capacity
there
were
some
who
declared
he
was
the
very
youth
who
stooped
to
pick
up
a
pin
in
a
parisian
banker
courtyard
after
his
services
as
clerk
had
just
been
rejected
by
the
firm
and
who
was
thereupon
recognised
as
a
youth
worthy
of
favour
and
taken
into
the
banker
office
but
this
touching
incident
of
the
pin
was
too
ancient
a
tradition
to
fit
smithson
still
under
forty
some
there
were
who
remembered
him
eighteen
years
ago
as
an
adventurer
in
the
great
wilderness
of
london
penniless
friendless
a
living
as
the
birds
of
the
air
live
and
with
as
little
certainty
of
future
maintenance
and
then
smithson
disappeared
for
a
space
he
went
under
as
his
friends
called
it
to
fifteen
years
later
as
smithson
the
millionaire
he
had
been
in
peru
mexico
california
he
had
traded
in
hides
in
diamonds
in
silver
in
stocks
and
shares
and
now
he
was
the
great
smithson
whose
voice
was
the
voice
of
an
oracle
who
was
supposed
to
be
able
to
make
the
fortunes
of
other
men
by
a
word
or
a
wink
a
nod
or
a
little
look
across
the
crowd
and
whom
all
the
men
and
women
in
london
society
short
of
that
exclusive
circle
which
does
open
its
ranks
to
smithsons
were
ready
to
cherish
and
admire
smithson
had
been
in
petersburg
paris
vienna
all
over
civilised
europe
during
the
last
five
weeks
whether
on
business
or
on
pleasure
bent
nobody
knew
he
affected
to
be
an
elegant
idler
but
it
was
said
by
the
initiated
that
wherever
smithson
went
the
markets
rose
or
fell
and
hides
iron
copper
or
tin
felt
the
influence
of
his
presence
he
came
back
to
london
in
time
for
the
cup
day
and
in
time
to
fall
desperately
in
love
with
lesbia
whom
he
met
for
the
first
time
in
the
royal
enclosure
she
was
dressed
in
white
purest
ivory
white
from
top
to
toe
radiant
dazzling
under
an
immense
sunshade
fringed
with
creamy
marabouts
her
complexion
untouched
by
seraphine
her
dark
and
glossy
hair
her
large
violet
eyes
luminous
dark
almost
to
blackness
were
all
set
off
and
accentuated
by
the
absence
of
colour
in
her
costume
even
the
cluster
of
exotics
on
her
shoulder
were
of
the
same
pure
tint
gardenias
and
lilies
of
the
valley
smithson
was
formally
presented
to
the
new
beauty
and
received
with
a
cool
contempt
which
riveted
his
chains
he
was
so
accustomed
to
be
run
after
by
women
that
it
was
a
new
sensation
to
meet
one
who
was
not
in
the
least
impressed
by
his
superior
merits
do
suppose
the
girl
knows
who
i
am
he
said
to
himself
for
although
he
had
a
very
good
idea
of
his
intrinsic
worth
he
knew
that
his
wealth
ranked
first
among
his
merits
but
on
after
occasions
when
lesbia
had
been
told
all
that
could
be
told
to
the
advantage
of
smithson
she
accepted
his
homage
with
the
same
indifference
and
treated
him
with
less
favour
than
she
accorded
to
the
ruined
guardsmen
and
younger
sons
who
were
dying
for
her
chapter
xxvi
can
i
never
be
of
what
i
hate
it
was
a
saturday
afternoon
and
even
in
that
great
world
which
has
no
occupation
in
life
except
to
amuse
itself
whose
days
are
all
holidays
there
is
a
sort
of
exceptional
flavour
a
kind
of
extra
excitement
on
saturday
afternoons
distinguished
by
polo
matches
at
hurlingham
just
as
saturday
evenings
are
by
the
production
of
new
plays
at
fashionable
theatres
there
was
a
great
military
polo
match
for
this
particular
saturday
lancers
against
dragoons
it
was
a
lovely
june
afternoon
and
hurlingham
would
be
at
its
best
the
cool
greensward
the
branching
trees
the
flowing
river
would
afford
an
unspeakable
relief
after
the
block
of
carriages
in
bond
street
and
the
heated
air
of
london
where
even
the
parks
felt
baked
and
arid
and
to
hurlingham
lady
kirkbank
drove
directly
after
luncheon
lesbia
leaned
back
in
the
barouche
listening
calmly
while
her
chaperon
expatiated
upon
the
wealth
and
possessions
of
horace
smithson
it
was
now
ten
days
since
the
meeting
at
ascot
and
smithson
had
contrived
to
see
a
great
deal
of
lesbia
in
that
short
time
he
was
invited
almost
everywhere
and
he
had
haunted
her
at
afternoon
and
evening
parties
he
had
supped
in
arlington
street
after
the
opera
he
had
played
cards
with
lesbia
and
had
enjoyed
the
felicity
of
winning
her
money
his
admiration
was
obvious
and
there
was
a
seriousness
in
his
manner
of
pursuing
her
which
showed
that
in
lady
kirkbank
unromantic
phraseology
man
meant
business
is
caught
at
last
and
i
am
glad
of
it
said
georgie
creature
is
an
abominable
flirt
and
has
broken
more
hearts
than
any
man
in
london
he
was
all
but
the
death
of
one
of
the
dearest
girls
i
know
smithson
breaks
hearts
exclaimed
lesbia
languidly
should
not
have
thought
that
was
in
his
line
smithson
is
not
an
adonis
nor
are
his
manners
particularly
fascinating
child
how
fresh
you
are
do
you
suppose
it
is
the
handsome
men
or
the
fascinating
men
for
whom
women
break
their
hearts
in
society
it
is
the
rich
men
they
all
want
to
marry
men
like
smithson
who
can
give
them
diamonds
and
yachts
and
a
hunting
stud
and
half
a
dozen
fine
houses
those
are
the
prizes
the
blue
ribbons
of
the
matrimonial
men
like
smithson
who
pretend
to
admire
all
the
pretty
women
who
dangle
and
dangle
and
keep
off
other
offers
and
give
ten
guinea
bouquets
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
season
are
off
to
hombourg
or
the
scotch
moors
without
a
word
do
you
think
that
kind
of
treatment
is
not
hard
enough
to
break
a
penniless
girl
heart
she
sees
the
golden
prize
within
her
grasp
as
she
believes
she
thinks
that
she
and
poverty
have
parted
company
for
ever
she
imagines
herself
mistress
of
town
house
and
country
houses
yachts
and
stables
and
then
one
fine
morning
the
gentleman
is
off
and
away
do
not
you
think
that
is
enough
to
break
a
girl
heart
can
imagine
that
a
girl
steeped
to
the
lips
in
poverty
might
be
willing
to
marry
smithson
houses
and
yachts
answered
lesbia
in
her
low
sweet
voice
with
a
faint
sneer
even
amidst
the
sweetness
i
think
it
must
have
been
a
happy
release
for
any
one
to
be
let
off
the
sacrifice
at
the
last
moment
belle
trinder
did
not
think
so
was
belle
trinder
essex
parson
daughter
whom
i
took
under
my
wing
five
years
ago
a
splendid
girl
large
and
fair
and
just
a
trifle
coarse
not
to
be
spoken
of
in
the
same
day
with
you
dearest
but
still
a
decidedly
handsome
creature
and
she
took
remarkably
well
she
was
a
very
lively
girl
never
ran
mute
sir
george
used
to
say
sir
george
was
very
fond
of
her
she
amused
him
poor
girl
with
her
rather
brainless
rattle
smithson
admired
her
her
about
everywhere
sent
her
whole
flower
gardens
in
the
way
of
bouquets
and
japanese
baskets
and
floral
for
her
gowns
and
opera
boxes
and
concert
tickets
their
names
were
always
coupled
people
used
to
call
them
bel
and
the
dragon
the
poor
child
made
up
her
mind
she
was
to
be
smithson
she
used
to
talk
of
what
she
would
do
for
her
own
people
the
poor
old
father
buried
alive
in
a
damp
parsonage
and
struggling
every
winter
with
chronic
bronchitis
the
four
younger
sisters
pining
in
dulness
and
penury
the
mother
who
hardly
knew
what
it
was
to
rest
from
the
continual
worries
of
daily
life
things
sighed
lesbia
gazing
admiringly
at
the
handle
of
her
last
new
sunshade
used
to
talk
of
what
she
would
do
for
them
all
pursued
lady
kirkbank
should
go
every
year
to
the
villa
at
monte
carlo
mother
and
the
girls
should
have
a
month
in
park
lane
every
season
and
their
autumn
holiday
at
one
of
smithson
country
houses
i
knew
the
world
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
this
kind
of
thing
would
never
answer
with
a
man
like
smithson
it
is
only
one
man
in
a
thousand
the
modern
arthur
the
modern
quixote
who
will
marry
a
whole
family
i
told
belle
as
much
but
she
laughed
she
felt
so
secure
of
her
power
over
the
man
he
will
do
anything
i
ask
him
she
said
trinder
must
be
an
extraordinary
young
person
observed
lesbia
scornfully
man
had
not
proposed
had
he
the
actual
proposal
hung
fire
but
belle
thought
it
was
a
settled
thing
all
the
same
everybody
talked
to
her
as
if
she
were
engaged
to
smithson
and
those
poor
ignorant
vicarage
girls
used
to
write
her
long
letters
of
congratulation
envying
her
good
fortune
speculating
about
what
she
would
do
when
she
was
married
the
girl
was
too
open
and
candid
for
london
society
talked
too
much
gave
the
view
before
she
was
sure
of
her
fox
sir
george
said
all
this
silly
talk
came
to
ears
and
one
morning
we
read
in
the
post
that
smithson
had
started
the
day
before
for
algiers
where
he
was
to
stay
at
the
house
of
the
english
consul
and
hunt
lions
we
waited
all
day
hoping
for
some
letter
of
explanation
some
friendly
farewell
which
would
mean
but
there
was
nothing
and
then
poor
belle
gave
way
altogether
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
went
out
of
one
hysterical
fit
into
another
i
never
heard
a
girl
sob
so
terribly
she
was
not
fit
to
be
seen
for
a
week
and
then
she
went
home
to
her
father
parsonage
in
the
flat
swampy
country
on
the
borders
of
suffolk
and
eat
her
heart
as
byron
calls
it
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
she
had
no
actual
justification
for
considering
herself
jilted
she
had
talked
and
other
people
had
talked
and
among
them
they
had
settled
the
business
but
smithson
had
said
hardly
anything
he
had
only
flirted
to
his
content
and
had
spent
a
few
hundreds
upon
flowers
gloves
fans
and
opera
tickets
which
perhaps
would
not
have
been
accepted
by
a
girl
with
a
strong
sense
of
her
own
dignity
should
think
not
indeed
interjected
lesbia
which
poor
belle
was
only
too
delighted
to
get
trinder
must
be
very
bad
style
said
lesbia
with
languid
scorn
smithson
is
an
execrable
person
did
she
die
my
dear
she
is
alive
poor
soul
said
she
broke
her
heart
the
heart
may
break
yet
brokenly
live
on
quoted
lady
kirkbank
disappointed
young
women
do
all
die
they
take
to
district
visiting
or
rational
dressing
or
china
painting
or
an
ambulance
brigade
the
lucky
ones
marry
widowers
with
large
families
and
so
slip
into
a
comfortable
groove
by
the
time
they
are
poor
belle
is
still
single
still
buried
in
the
damp
parsonage
where
she
paints
plates
and
teacups
and
wears
out
my
old
gowns
just
as
she
is
wearing
out
her
own
life
poor
creature
idea
of
any
one
wanting
to
marry
smithson
said
lesbia
seems
too
dreadful
case
of
real
destitution
you
think
wait
till
you
have
seen
smithson
house
in
park
lane
his
team
his
yacht
his
orchid
houses
in
berkshire
lesbia
sighed
her
knowledge
of
london
society
was
only
seven
weeks
old
and
yet
already
the
day
of
disenchantment
had
begun
she
was
having
her
eyes
opened
to
the
stern
realities
of
life
a
year
ago
when
her
appearance
in
the
great
world
was
still
only
a
dream
of
the
future
she
had
pictured
to
herself
the
crowd
of
suitors
who
would
come
to
woo
and
she
had
resolved
to
choose
the
worthiest
what
would
he
be
like
that
worthiest
among
the
wooers
that
king
arthur
among
her
knights
first
and
foremost
he
would
be
of
rank
higher
than
her
own
a
duke
a
marquis
or
one
of
the
first
and
oldest
among
earls
title
and
lofty
lineage
were
indispensable
it
would
be
a
fall
a
failure
a
disappointment
were
she
to
marry
a
commoner
however
distinguished
the
worthy
one
must
be
noble
therefore
and
of
the
old
nobility
he
must
be
young
handsome
intellectual
he
must
stand
out
from
among
his
peers
by
his
gifts
of
mind
and
person
he
must
have
won
distinction
in
the
arena
of
politics
or
diplomacy
arms
or
letters
he
must
be
she
had
been
seven
weeks
in
society
and
this
modern
arthur
had
not
appeared
so
far
as
she
had
been
able
to
discover
there
was
no
such
person
the
dukes
and
marquises
were
mostly
men
of
advanced
years
the
young
unmarried
nobility
were
given
over
to
sport
play
and
foolishness
she
had
heard
of
only
one
man
who
at
all
corresponded
with
her
ideal
and
he
was
lord
hartfield
but
lord
hartfield
had
given
himself
up
to
politics
and
was
no
doubt
a
prig
lady
kirkbank
spoke
of
him
with
contempt
as
an
intolerable
person
but
then
lord
hartfield
was
not
in
lady
kirkbank
set
he
belonged
to
that
serious
circle
to
which
lady
kirkbank
house
appeared
about
as
reputable
a
place
of
gathering
as
a
booth
on
a
and
now
lady
kirkbank
told
lesbia
that
this
smithson
a
nobody
with
a
great
fortune
was
a
man
whose
addresses
she
the
sister
of
lord
maulevrier
ought
to
welcome
smithson
who
claimed
to
be
a
lineal
descendant
of
that
sir
michael
carrington
to
coeur
de
lion
in
the
holy
land
whose
descendants
changed
their
name
to
smith
during
the
wars
of
the
roses
smithson
bodily
proclaimed
himself
a
scion
of
this
good
old
county
family
and
bore
on
his
plate
and
his
coach
panels
the
elephant
head
and
the
three
of
the
hertfordshire
smiths
who
only
smiled
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
when
they
were
complimented
upon
the
splendid
surroundings
of
their
cousin
who
could
tell
some
lateral
branch
of
the
family
tree
might
have
borne
this
illustrious
twig
lady
kirkbank
and
all
lady
kirkbank
friends
seemed
to
have
conspired
to
teach
lesbia
haselden
one
lesson
and
that
lesson
meant
that
money
was
the
first
prize
in
the
great
game
of
life
money
ranked
before
everything
before
titles
before
noble
lineage
genius
fame
beauty
courage
honour
money
was
alpha
and
omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
smithson
whose
antecedents
were
as
cloudy
as
those
of
aphrodite
was
a
greater
man
than
a
peer
whose
broad
acres
only
brought
him
two
per
or
half
of
whose
farms
were
tenantless
and
his
fields
growing
cockle
instead
of
barley
yes
one
by
one
lady
lesbia
illusions
were
reft
from
her
a
year
ago
she
had
fancied
beauty
a
gift
which
must
ensure
to
its
possessor
dominion
over
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
rank
intellect
fame
would
bow
down
before
that
magical
diadem
and
behold
she
had
been
shining
upon
london
society
for
seven
weeks
and
only
empty
heads
and
empty
pockets
had
bowed
down
the
frivolous
the
ineligible
and
smithson
another
illusion
which
had
been
dispelled
was
lesbia
comfortable
idea
of
her
own
expectations
her
grandmother
had
told
her
that
she
might
take
rank
among
heiresses
and
she
had
held
herself
accordingly
deeming
that
her
place
was
among
the
wealthiest
and
now
since
appearance
upon
the
scene
lady
kirkbank
had
informed
her
young
friend
with
noble
candour
that
lady
maulevrier
fortune
however
large
it
might
seem
at
grasmere
would
be
a
poor
thing
in
london
and
that
lady
maulevrier
ideas
about
money
were
as
as
her
notions
about
morals
is
about
six
times
as
expensive
as
it
was
in
your
time
said
lady
kirkbank
as
the
carriage
rolled
softly
along
the
shabby
road
between
knightsbridge
and
fulham
is
the
pace
that
kills
society
which
used
to
jog
along
comfortably
like
the
old
brighton
stage
at
ten
miles
an
hour
now
goes
as
fast
as
the
brighton
express
in
my
mother
time
poor
lord
byron
was
held
up
to
the
execration
of
respectable
people
as
the
type
of
cynical
profligacy
in
my
own
time
people
talked
about
lord
waterford
but
my
dear
the
young
men
now
are
all
byrons
and
waterfords
without
the
genius
of
the
one
or
the
generosity
of
the
other
we
are
all
going
at
steeplechase
rate
social
success
without
money
is
impossible
the
rich
americans
the
successful
jews
will
crowd
us
out
unless
we
keep
pace
with
them
ah
lesbia
my
dear
girl
there
would
be
a
great
future
before
you
if
you
could
only
make
up
your
mind
to
accept
mr
smithson
do
you
know
that
he
means
to
propose
to
me
asked
lesbia
mockingly
he
is
only
going
to
behave
as
he
did
to
miss
trinder
lesbia
haselden
is
a
very
different
person
from
a
country
daughter
answered
her
chaperon
told
me
all
about
it
afterwards
he
was
really
taken
with
belle
fine
figure
and
good
complexion
but
one
of
her
particular
friends
told
him
of
her
foolish
talk
about
her
sisters
and
how
well
she
meant
to
get
them
married
when
she
was
smithson
this
disgusted
him
he
went
down
to
essex
reconnoitered
the
parsonage
saw
one
of
the
sisters
hanging
out
cuffs
and
collars
in
the
orchard
another
feeding
the
fowls
both
in
shabby
gowns
and
boots
one
of
them
with
red
hair
and
freckles
the
mother
was
bargaining
for
fish
with
a
hawker
at
the
kitchen
door
and
these
were
the
people
he
was
expected
to
import
into
park
lane
under
ceilings
painted
by
leighton
these
were
the
people
he
was
to
exhibit
on
board
his
yacht
to
cart
about
on
his
drag
i
had
half
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
the
girl
but
i
would
sooner
have
hung
myself
than
marry
her
mother
and
sisters
so
i
took
the
first
train
for
dover
en
route
for
algiers
said
smithson
and
upon
my
word
i
could
hardly
blame
the
man
concluded
lady
kirkbank
they
were
driving
up
the
narrow
avenue
to
the
gates
of
hurlingham
by
this
time
lesbia
shook
out
her
frock
and
looked
at
her
gloves
mousquetaires
reaching
up
to
the
elbow
and
embroidered
to
match
her
frock
she
was
a
study
in
brown
and
gold
brown
satin
petticoat
embroidered
with
marsh
marigolds
little
bronze
shoes
with
marsh
marigolds
tied
on
the
latchets
brown
stockings
with
marsh
marigold
clocks
tunic
brown
foulard
smothered
with
quillings
of
soft
brown
lace
princess
bonnet
of
brown
straw
with
a
wreath
of
marsh
marigold
and
a
neat
little
buckle
of
brown
diamonds
parasol
brown
satin
with
an
immense
bunch
of
marsh
marigolds
on
the
top
fan
to
match
parasol
the
seats
in
front
of
the
field
were
nearly
all
full
when
lady
kirkbank
and
lesbia
left
their
carriage
but
their
interests
had
been
protected
by
a
gentleman
who
had
turned
down
two
chairs
and
sat
between
them
on
guard
this
was
smithson
have
been
sitting
here
for
an
hour
keeping
your
chairs
he
said
as
he
rose
to
greet
them
have
no
idea
what
work
i
have
had
and
how
ferociously
all
the
women
have
looked
at
me
the
match
was
going
on
the
lancers
were
scuffling
for
the
ball
and
affording
a
fine
display
of
ponies
and
young
men
in
ideal
boots
but
lesbia
cared
very
little
about
the
match
she
was
looking
along
the
serried
ranks
of
youth
and
beauty
to
see
if
frock
was
smarter
than
her
own
no
she
could
see
nothing
she
liked
so
well
as
her
brown
satin
and
buttercups
she
sat
down
in
a
perfectly
contented
frame
of
mind
pleased
with
herself
and
with
seraphine
pleased
even
with
smithson
who
had
shown
himself
devoted
by
his
patient
attendance
upon
the
empty
chairs
after
the
match
was
over
the
two
ladies
and
their
attendant
strolled
about
the
gardens
other
men
came
and
fluttered
round
lesbia
and
women
and
girls
exchanged
endearing
smiles
and
pretty
little
words
of
greeting
with
her
and
envied
her
the
brown
frock
and
buttercups
and
smithson
at
her
chariot
wheel
and
then
they
went
to
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
which
was
so
crowded
that
even
smithson
found
it
difficult
to
get
a
and
would
hardly
have
succeeded
so
soon
as
he
did
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
assistance
of
a
couple
of
devoted
guardsmen
who
ran
to
and
fro
and
badgered
the
waiters
after
much
skirmishing
they
were
seated
at
a
rustic
table
the
blue
river
gleaming
and
glancing
in
the
distance
the
good
old
trees
spreading
their
broad
shadows
over
the
grass
the
company
crowding
and
chattering
and
laughing
an
animated
picture
of
pretty
faces
smart
gowns
big
parasols
japanese
fans
lesbia
poured
out
the
tea
with
the
prettiest
air
of
domesticity
you
really
pour
out
tea
gasped
a
callow
lieutenant
gazing
upon
her
with
goggling
enraptured
eyes
did
not
think
you
could
do
anything
so
earthly
can
and
drink
it
too
answered
lesbia
laughing
adore
tea
cream
and
sugar
i
beg
your
pardon
how
many
murmured
the
youth
who
had
lost
himself
in
gazing
and
no
longer
understood
plain
english
smithson
frowned
at
the
intruder
and
contrived
to
absorb
attention
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
he
had
a
good
deal
more
to
say
for
himself
than
her
military
admirers
and
was
altogether
more
amusing
he
had
a
little
cynical
air
which
lesbia
recent
education
had
taught
her
to
enjoy
he
depreciated
all
her
female
friends
abused
their
gowns
and
bonnets
and
gave
her
to
understand
between
the
lines
as
it
were
that
she
was
the
only
woman
in
london
worth
thinking
about
she
looked
at
him
curiously
wondering
how
belle
trinder
had
been
able
to
resign
herself
to
the
idea
of
marrying
him
he
was
not
absolutely
bad
looking
but
he
was
in
all
things
unlike
a
girl
ideal
lover
he
was
short
and
stout
with
a
pale
complexion
and
sunken
faded
eyes
as
of
a
man
who
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
by
candle
light
and
had
pored
much
over
ledgers
and
bank
books
share
lists
and
prospectuses
he
dressed
well
or
allowed
himself
to
be
dressed
by
the
most
correct
of
tailors
the
prince
tailor
but
he
never
attempted
to
lead
the
fashion
in
his
garments
he
had
no
originality
such
sublime
flights
as
that
of
the
man
who
revived
corduroy
or
of
that
daring
genius
who
resuscitated
the
inverness
coat
were
unknown
to
him
he
could
only
follow
the
lead
of
the
highest
he
had
small
feet
of
which
he
was
intensely
proud
podgy
white
hands
on
which
he
wore
the
most
exquisite
rings
he
changed
his
rings
every
day
like
a
roman
emperor
was
reported
to
have
summer
and
winter
rings
onyx
and
the
coolest
looking
intaglios
set
in
filagree
for
warm
weather
fiery
rubies
and
diamonds
in
massive
bands
of
dull
gold
for
winter
he
was
said
to
devote
every
morning
to
the
treatment
of
his
nails
which
were
perfect
all
the
inkstains
of
his
youth
had
been
obliterated
and
those
nails
which
had
once
been
bitten
to
the
quick
during
the
throes
of
financial
study
were
now
things
of
beauty
lady
lesbia
surveyed
smithson
critically
and
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
this
person
was
the
best
substitute
which
the
season
had
yet
offered
her
for
her
ideal
knight
she
thought
of
john
hammond
the
tall
strong
figure
straight
and
square
the
head
so
proudly
carried
on
a
neck
which
would
have
graced
a
greek
arena
the
straight
features
the
flashing
eyes
bright
with
youth
and
hope
and
the
promise
of
all
good
things
yes
there
was
indeed
a
man
a
man
in
all
the
nobility
of
manhood
as
god
made
him
an
adam
before
the
fall
ah
if
john
hammond
had
only
possessed
a
quarter
of
wealth
how
gladly
would
lesbia
have
defied
the
world
and
married
him
but
to
defy
the
world
upon
nothing
a
year
was
out
of
the
question
did
he
go
on
the
stock
exchange
and
make
his
fortune
thought
lesbia
pettishly
of
talking
vaguely
about
politics
and
literature
she
felt
angry
with
her
rejected
lover
for
having
come
to
her
she
had
seen
no
man
in
london
who
was
or
who
seemed
to
her
his
equal
and
yet
she
did
not
repent
of
having
rejected
him
the
more
she
knew
of
the
world
and
the
more
she
knew
of
herself
the
more
deeply
was
she
convinced
that
poverty
was
an
evil
thing
and
that
she
was
not
the
right
kind
of
person
to
endure
it
she
was
inwardly
making
these
comparisons
as
they
strolled
back
to
the
carriage
while
smithson
and
lady
kirkbank
talked
confidentially
at
her
side
you
know
that
lady
kirkbank
has
promised
and
vowed
three
things
for
you
said
smithson
i
thought
i
was
past
the
age
at
which
one
can
be
compromised
by
other
people
promises
pray
what
are
those
three
things
that
you
will
come
to
breakfast
in
park
lane
with
lady
kirkbank
next
wednesday
morning
i
say
wednesday
because
that
will
give
me
time
to
ask
some
nice
people
to
meet
you
secondly
that
you
will
honour
me
by
occupying
my
box
at
the
lyceum
some
evening
next
week
and
thirdly
that
you
will
allow
me
to
drive
you
down
to
the
orleans
for
supper
after
the
play
the
drive
only
takes
an
hour
and
the
moonlight
nights
are
delicious
at
this
time
of
the
year
am
in
lady
kirkbank
hands
answered
lesbia
laughing
am
her
goods
her
chattels
she
takes
me
wherever
she
likes
would
you
refuse
to
do
me
this
honour
if
you
were
a
free
agent
ca
tell
i
hardly
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
free
agent
at
grasmere
i
did
whatever
my
grandmother
told
me
in
london
i
obey
lady
kirkbank
i
was
transferred
from
one
master
to
another
why
should
we
breakfast
in
park
lane
instead
of
in
arlington
street
what
is
the
use
of
crossing
piccadilly
to
eat
our
breakfast
this
was
a
style
of
treatment
to
which
smithson
was
not
accustomed
and
which
charmed
him
accordingly
young
women
usually
threw
themselves
at
his
head
as
it
were
but
here
was
a
girl
who
talked
to
him
as
indifferently
as
if
he
were
a
tradesman
offering
his
wares
a
dreadfully
practical
person
you
are
he
exclaimed
is
the
use
of
crossing
piccadilly
well
in
the
first
place
you
will
make
me
ineffably
happy
but
perhaps
that
does
count
in
the
second
place
i
shall
be
able
to
show
you
some
rather
good
pictures
of
the
french
school
hate
the
french
school
interjected
lesbia
flashy
chalky
shallow
smelling
of
the
footlights
and
the
studio
sink
the
pictures
you
will
meet
some
very
charming
people
belonging
to
that
artist
world
which
is
not
to
be
met
everywhere
will
go
to
park
lane
to
meet
your
people
if
lady
kirkbank
likes
to
take
me
said
lesbia
and
with
this
answer
smithson
was
bound
to
be
content
pet
if
you
had
made
it
the
study
of
your
life
how
to
treat
that
man
you
could
not
do
it
better
said
lady
kirkbank
when
they
were
driving
along
the
dusty
road
between
dusty
hedges
and
dusty
trees
past
that
last
remnant
of
country
which
was
daily
being
debased
into
london
my
word
lesbia
i
begin
to
think
you
must
be
a
genius
you
see
any
gowns
you
liked
better
than
mine
asked
lesbia
reclining
reposefully
with
her
little
bronze
shoes
upon
the
opposite
cushion
one
seraphine
has
surpassed
herself
are
always
saying
that
one
would
suppose
you
were
a
sleeping
partner
in
the
firm
but
i
really
think
this
brown
and
buttercups
is
rather
nice
i
saw
that
odious
american
girl
just
now
miss
miss
milwaukee
that
girl
people
raved
about
at
cannes
she
was
in
pale
blue
and
cream
colour
a
milk
and
water
mixture
and
looked
positively
plain
chapter

lesbia
crosses
piccadilly
lady
kirkbank
and
lady
lesbia
drove
across
piccadilly
at
eleven
on
wednesday
morning
to
breakfast
with
smithson
and
although
lesbia
had
questioned
whether
it
was
worth
while
crossing
piccadilly
to
eat
one
breakfast
she
had
subsequently
considered
it
worth
while
ordering
a
new
gown
from
seraphine
for
the
occasion
or
it
may
be
rather
that
the
breakfast
made
a
plausible
excuse
for
a
new
gown
the
pleasure
of
ordering
which
was
one
of
those
joys
of
a
london
life
that
had
not
yet
lost
their
savour
the
gown
devised
especially
for
the
early
morning
was
simplicity
itself
rusticity
even
it
was
a
dresden
shepherdess
gown
made
of
a
soft
flowered
stuff
with
roses
and
on
a
creamy
ground
there
was
a
great
deal
of
creamy
lace
and
innumerable
yards
of
palest
azure
and
palest
rose
ribbon
in
the
confection
and
there
was
a
coquettish
little
hat
the
regular
dresden
hat
with
a
wreath
of
rosebuds
china
incarnate
exclaimed
smithson
as
he
welcomed
lady
lesbia
on
the
threshold
of
his
marble
hall
under
the
glass
marquise
which
sheltered
arrivals
at
his
door
do
you
make
yourself
so
lovely
i
shall
want
to
keep
you
in
one
of
my
louis
seize
cabinets
with
the
rest
of
my
dresden
lady
kirkbank
had
considered
the
occasion
suitable
for
one
of
her
favourite
cotton
frocks
and
rustic
hats
a
leghorn
hat
with
clusters
of
and
honeysuckle
and
a
trail
of
the
same
to
fasten
her
muslin
fichu
smithson
house
in
park
lane
was
simply
perfect
it
is
wonderful
what
good
use
a
can
make
of
his
money
nowadays
and
how
rarely
he
disgraces
himself
by
any
marked
offences
against
good
taste
there
are
so
many
people
at
hand
to
teach
the
how
to
furnish
his
house
or
how
to
choose
his
stud
if
he
go
wrong
it
must
be
by
sheer
perversity
an
arrogant
insistence
upon
being
governed
by
his
own
ignorant
inclinations
smithson
was
too
good
a
tactician
to
go
wrong
in
this
way
he
had
taken
the
trouble
to
study
the
market
before
he
went
out
to
buy
his
goods
he
knew
that
taste
and
knowledge
were
to
be
bought
just
as
easily
as
chairs
and
tables
and
he
went
to
the
right
shop
he
employed
a
clever
scotchman
an
artist
in
domestic
furniture
to
plan
his
house
and
make
drawings
for
the
decoration
and
furniture
of
every
room
and
for
six
months
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
task
of
furnishing
money
was
spent
like
water
painters
decorators
had
a
merry
time
of
it
royal
academicians
were
impressed
into
the
service
by
large
offers
and
the
final
result
of
macwalter
taste
and
smithson
bullion
was
a
palace
in
the
style
of
the
italian
renaissance
frescoed
ceilings
painted
panels
a
staircase
of
sculptured
marble
as
beautiful
as
a
dream
a
conservatory
as
exquisite
as
a
jewel
casket
by
benvenuto
cellini
a
picture
gallery
which
was
the
admiration
of
all
london
and
of
the
enlightened
foreigner
and
of
the
inquiring
american
this
was
the
house
which
lesbia
had
been
brought
to
see
and
through
which
she
walked
with
the
calmly
critical
air
of
a
person
who
had
seen
so
many
palaces
that
one
more
or
less
could
make
no
difference
in
vain
did
smithson
peruse
her
countenance
in
the
hope
of
seeing
that
she
was
impressed
by
the
splendour
of
his
surroundings
and
by
the
power
of
the
man
who
commanded
such
splendour
lesbia
was
as
cold
as
the
italian
sculptor
reading
girl
in
an
alcove
of
smithson
picture
gallery
and
the
stockbroker
felt
very
much
as
aladdin
might
have
done
if
the
fair
badroulbadour
had
shown
herself
indifferent
to
the
hall
of
the
jewelled
windows
in
that
magical
palace
which
sprang
into
being
in
a
single
night
lesbia
had
been
impressed
by
that
story
of
poor
belle
trinder
and
by
lady
kirkbank
broad
assertion
that
half
the
young
women
in
london
were
running
after
smithson
and
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
treat
the
man
with
supreme
scorn
she
did
not
want
his
houses
or
his
yachts
nothing
could
induce
her
to
marry
such
a
man
she
told
herself
but
her
vanity
fed
upon
the
idea
of
his
subjugation
and
her
pride
was
gratified
by
the
sense
of
her
power
over
him
the
guests
were
few
and
choice
there
was
meander
the
poet
one
of
the
leading
lights
in
that
new
sect
which
prides
itself
upon
the
cultivation
of
abstract
beauty
and
occasionally
touches
the
verge
of
concrete
ugliness
there
were
a
newspaper
man
the
editor
of
a
fashionable
journal
and
a
man
of
letters
playwright
critic
humourist
a
man
whose
society
was
in
demand
everywhere
and
who
said
sharp
things
with
the
most
supreme
the
only
ladies
whose
society
smithson
had
deemed
worthy
the
occasion
were
a
fashionable
actress
with
her
younger
sister
the
younger
a
pretty
copy
of
the
elder
both
dressed
picturesquely
in
flowing
cashmere
gowns
of
faint
with
old
lace
fichus
leghorn
hats
and
a
general
limpness
and
simplicity
of
style
which
suited
their
cast
of
feature
and
delicate
colouring
lesbia
wondered
to
see
how
good
an
effect
could
be
produced
by
a
costume
which
could
have
cost
so
little
nightshade
the
famous
tragedian
had
been
also
asked
to
grace
the
feast
but
the
early
hour
made
the
invitation
a
mockery
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
a
man
who
went
to
bed
at
daybreak
would
get
up
again
before
the
sun
was
in
the
zenith
for
the
sake
of
smithson
society
or
strasbourg
pie
for
the
manufacture
whereof
a
particular
breed
of
geese
were
supposed
to
be
set
apart
like
sacred
birds
in
egypt
while
a
particular
vineyard
in
the
gironde
was
supposed
to
be
devoted
wholly
and
solely
to
the
production
of
smithson
claret
it
was
a
cabinet
wine
like
those
rare
vintages
of
the
rhineland
which
are
reserved
exclusively
for
german
princes
breakfast
was
served
in
smithson
smallest
there
were
three
apartments
given
up
to
feasting
beginning
with
a
spacious
for
great
dinners
and
dwindling
down
to
this
snuggery
which
held
about
a
dozen
comfortably
with
ample
room
and
verge
enough
for
the
attendants
the
walls
were
old
gold
silk
the
curtains
a
tawny
velvet
of
deeper
tone
the
cabinets
and
buffet
of
dark
italian
walnut
inlaid
with
and
amber
the
fireplace
was
a
masterpiece
of
cabinet
work
with
high
narrow
shelves
and
curious
recesses
holding
priceless
jars
of
oriental
enamel
the
deep
hearth
was
filled
with
arum
lilies
and
azalias
like
a
font
at
easter
lady
kirkbank
who
pretended
to
adore
genius
was
affectionately
effusive
to
miss
fitzherbert
the
popular
actress
but
she
rather
ignored
the
sister
lesbia
was
less
cordial
and
was
not
enchanted
at
finding
that
miss
fitzherbert
shone
and
sparkled
at
the
breakfast
table
by
the
gaiety
of
her
spirits
and
the
brightness
of
her
conversation
there
was
something
frank
and
joyous
almost
to
childishness
in
the
actress
manner
which
was
full
of
fascination
and
lesbia
felt
herself
at
a
disadvantage
almost
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
been
in
london
the
editor
the
wit
the
poet
the
actress
had
a
language
of
their
own
and
lesbia
felt
herself
out
in
the
cold
unable
to
catch
the
ball
as
it
glanced
past
her
not
quick
enough
to
follow
the
wit
that
evoked
those
ripples
of
silvery
laughter
from
the
two
girls
in
cashmere
she
felt
as
an
englishman
may
feel
who
has
made
himself
master
of
academical
french
and
who
takes
up
one
of
novels
or
goes
into
artistic
society
and
finds
that
there
is
another
french
a
complete
and
copious
language
of
which
he
knows
not
a
word
lesbia
began
to
think
that
she
had
a
great
deal
to
learn
she
began
to
wonder
even
whether
in
the
event
of
her
having
made
rather
too
free
use
of
lady
maulevrier
it
might
not
be
well
to
make
a
new
departure
in
the
art
of
dressing
and
to
wear
untrimmed
cashmere
gowns
and
rags
of
limp
lace
after
breakfast
they
all
went
to
look
at
smithson
picture
gallery
his
pictures
were
as
he
had
told
lesbia
chiefly
of
the
french
school
and
there
may
have
been
a
remote
period
say
in
the
time
of
good
queen
charlotte
when
such
pictures
would
hardly
have
been
exhibited
to
young
ladies
his
pictures
were
smithson
own
unaided
choice
here
the
individual
taste
of
the
man
stood
revealed
there
were
two
or
three
geromes
and
in
the
place
of
honour
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
there
was
a
grand
delaroche
anne
boleyn
last
letter
to
the
king
the
hapless
sitting
at
a
table
in
her
gloomy
cell
in
the
tower
a
shaft
of
golden
light
from
the
narrow
window
streaming
on
the
fair
disordered
hair
the
face
bleached
with
unutterable
woe
a
sublime
image
of
despair
and
the
larger
pictures
were
historical
classic
grand
but
the
smaller
pictures
the
lively
little
bits
of
colour
dotted
in
here
and
there
were
of
that
new
school
which
smithson
affected
they
were
of
that
school
which
is
called
impressionist
in
which
ballet
dancers
and
jockeys
burlesque
actresses
masked
balls
and
all
the
humours
of
the
side
scenes
are
represented
with
the
sublime
audacity
of
an
art
which
disdains
finish
and
relies
on
fougue
chien
flou
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
lesbia
blushed
as
she
looked
at
the
ballet
girls
the
maskers
in
their
scanty
raiment
the
lolling
out
of
their
opera
boxes
and
half
out
of
their
gowns
with
false
smiles
and
frizzled
hair
and
then
there
came
the
works
of
that
other
school
which
lavishes
the
finish
of
a
meissonier
on
the
most
meretricious
compositions
a
woman
in
a
velvet
gown
warming
her
dainty
little
feet
on
a
gilded
fender
in
a
boudoir
all
aglow
with
colour
and
lamplight
a
cavalier
in
satin
raiment
buckling
his
before
a
venetian
mirror
a
pair
of
lovers
kissing
in
a
sunlit
corridor
a
girl
in
a
hansom
cab
a
milliner
shop
and
so
on
and
so
on
then
came
the
classical
subjects
of
the
last
new
school
weak
imitations
of
alma
tadema
nero
admiring
his
mother
corpse
claudius
interrupting
messalina
marriage
with
her
lover
silus
clodius
disguised
among
the
women
of
cæsar
household
pyrrha
grotto
lady
kirkbank
expatiated
upon
all
the
pictures
and
generally
made
unlucky
guesses
at
the
subjects
of
them
classical
literature
was
not
her
strong
point
meander
the
poet
discovered
that
all
the
beautiful
heads
were
like
miss
fitzherbert
is
the
same
line
he
exclaimed
line
of
lilies
and
flowing
waters
the
gracious
ineffable
upward
returning
ripple
of
the
true
nose
the
divine
the
loveliness
which
has
lain
dormant
for
centuries
nay
was
at
one
period
of
debased
art
scorned
and
trampled
under
foot
by
the
porcine
multitude
as
akin
to
the
pug
and
the
until
discovered
and
enshrined
on
the
altar
of
the
beautiful
by
the
boticelli
revivalists
miss
fitzherbert
simpered
and
accepted
these
remarks
as
mere
statements
of
obvious
fact
she
was
accustomed
to
hear
of
boticelli
and
the
early
italian
painters
in
connection
with
her
own
charms
of
face
and
figure
lesbia
whose
faultless
features
were
of
the
aquiline
type
regarded
the
bard
rhapsody
as
insufferable
twaddle
and
began
to
think
smithson
almost
a
wit
when
he
made
fun
of
the
bard
smithson
was
enchanted
when
she
laughed
at
his
jokelets
even
although
she
did
not
scruple
to
tell
him
that
she
thought
his
favourite
pictures
detestable
and
looked
with
the
eye
of
indifference
on
a
collection
of
jade
that
was
worth
a
small
fortune
meander
fell
into
another
rhapsody
over
those
classic
cups
and
shallow
little
bowls
of
jade
if
you
like
are
colour
and
beauty
he
murmured
caressing
one
of
the
little
cups
with
the
roseate
tips
of
his
supple
fingers
dearest
smithson
are
worth
all
the
rest
of
your
collection
worth
vanloads
of
your
cloisonné
enamels
your
in
and
blue
this
cloudy
indefinable
substance
not
crudely
transparent
nor
yet
distinctly
opaque
a
something
which
touches
the
boundary
line
of
two
worlds
the
real
and
the
ideal
and
then
the
colour
great
heaven
can
anything
be
lovelier
than
this
shadowy
tint
which
is
neither

the

of

after

to

to
buy
him
a

the

smiling
on

company
as
they
gathered
round
the
florentine
table
on
which
the
jade
specimens
were
set
out
lady
kirkbank
looking
at
the
little
cups
and
basins
as
if
she
thought
they
were
going
to
do
something
after
all
this
fuss
had
been
made
about
them
it
seemed
hardly
credible
that
any
reasonable
being
could
have
given
thirty
guineas
for
one
of
those
bits
of
clouded
glass
unless
the
thing
had
some
peculiar
property
of
expansion
or
contraction
after
this
breakfast
in
park
lane
lady
lesbia
and
her
admirer
met
daily
he
went
to
all
her
parties
he
sat
out
waltzes
with
her
in
conservatories
and
on
staircases
for
horace
smithson
was
much
too
shrewd
a
man
to
enter
himself
in
the
race
for
dancing
men
handicapped
by
his
forty
years
and
his
fourteen
stone
he
contrived
to
amuse
lesbia
by
his
conversation
which
was
essentially
mundane
depreciating
people
whom
all
the
rest
of
the
world
admired
or
pretended
to
admire
telling
her
of
the
secret
springs
by
which
the
society
she
saw
around
her
was
moved
he
was
judicious
in
his
revelations
of
hidden
evil
and
careful
to
say
nothing
which
should
offend
lady
lesbia
modesty
yet
he
contrived
in
a
very
short
time
to
teach
her
that
the
world
in
which
she
lived
was
an
utterly
corrupt
world
whose
high
priest
was
satan
that
all
lofty
aspirations
and
noble
sentiments
were
out
of
place
in
society
and
that
the
worst
among
the
people
she
met
were
the
people
who
laid
any
claim
to
being
better
than
their
neighbours
why
i
adore
lady
kirkbank
he
said
confidentially
dear
soul
never
pretends
to
be
any
better
than
the
rest
of
us
she
gambles
and
we
all
know
she
gambles
she
pegs
and
we
all
know
she
pegs
and
she
makes
rather
a
boast
of
being
up
to
her
eyes
in
debt
no
humbug
about
dear
old
georgie
lesbia
had
seen
enough
of
her
chaperon
by
this
time
to
know
that
smithson
description
of
the
lady
was
correct
and
this
being
so
she
supposed
that
the
facts
and
traits
of
character
which
he
told
her
about
in
other
people
were
also
true
she
thus
adopted
the
smithsonian
or
view
of
society
in
general
and
resigned
herself
to
the
idea
that
the
world
was
a
very
wicked
world
as
well
as
a
very
pleasant
world
that
the
wickedest
people
were
generally
the
pleasantest
and
that
it
did
not
much
matter
the
fact
that
smithson
was
at
lesbia
haselden
feet
was
obvious
to
everybody
lesbia
who
had
at
first
treated
him
with
supreme
hauteur
had
grown
more
civil
as
she
began
to
understand
the
place
he
held
in
the
world
and
how
much
social
influence
goes
along
with
unlimited
wealth
she
was
civil
but
she
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
nothing
could
ever
induce
her
to
become
horace
smithson
wife
that
offer
which
had
hung
fire
in
the
case
of
poor
belle
trinder
was
not
too
long
delayed
on
this
occasion
smithson
called
in
arlington
street
about
ten
days
after
the
breakfast
in
park
lane
before
luncheon
and
before
lady
kirkbank
had
left
her
room
he
brought
tickets
for
a
in
belgrave
square
at
which
a
new
and
wonderful
russian
pianiste
was
to
make
a
kind
of
before
an
audience
of
critics
and
distinguished
amateurs
and
the
elect
of
the
musical
world
they
were
tickets
which
money
could
not
buy
and
were
thus
a
meet
offering
for
lady
lesbia
and
a
plausible
excuse
for
an
early
call
smithson
succeeded
in
seeing
lesbia
alone
and
then
and
there
with
very
little
circumlocution
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
her
social
education
had
advanced
considerably
since
that
summer
day
in
the
when
john
hammond
had
wooed
her
with
passionate
wooing
smithson
was
a
much
less
ardent
suitor
and
made
his
offer
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
expects
to
be
accepted
lesbia
beautiful
head
bent
a
little
like
a
lily
on
its
stalk
and
a
faint
blush
deepened
the
pale
rose
tint
of
her
complexion
her
reply
was
courteous
and
conventional
she
was
flattered
she
was
grateful
for
smithson
high
opinion
of
her
but
she
was
deeply
grieved
if
anything
in
her
manner
had
given
him
reason
to
think
that
he
was
more
to
her
than
a
friend
an
old
friend
of
dear
lady
kirkbank
whom
she
was
naturally
predisposed
to
like
as
lady
kirkbank
friend
horace
smithson
turned
pale
as
death
but
if
he
was
angry
he
gave
no
utterance
to
his
angry
feelings
he
only
asked
if
lady
lesbia
answer
was
final
and
on
being
told
that
it
was
so
he
dismissed
the
subject
in
the
easiest
manner
and
with
a
gentlemanlike
placidity
which
very
much
astonished
the
lady
say
that
you
regard
me
as
your
friend
he
said
not
withdraw
that
privilege
from
me
because
i
have
asked
for
a
higher
place
in
your
esteem
forget
all
i
have
said
this
morning
be
assured
i
shall
never
offend
you
by
repeating
it
are
more
than
good
murmured
lesbia
who
had
expected
a
wild
outbreak
of
despair
or
fury
rather
than
this
friendly
calm
hope
that
you
and
lady
kirkbank
will
go
and
hear
madame
metzikoff
this
afternoon
pursued
smithson
returning
to
the
subject
of
the
duchess
rooms
are
lovely
but
no
doubt
you
know
them
lesbia
blushed
and
confessed
that
the
duchess
of
lostwithiel
was
one
of
those
select
few
who
were
not
on
lady
kirkbank
visiting
list
are
people
lady
kirkbank
can
not
get
on
with
she
said
she
will
hardly
like
to
go
to
the
duchess
as
she
does
not
visit
her
but
this
affair
counts
for
nothing
we
go
to
hear
metzikoff
not
to
bow
down
to
the
duchess
all
the
people
in
town
who
care
for
music
will
be
there
and
you
who
play
so
divinely
must
enjoy
fine
professional
playing
worship
a
really
great
player
said
lesbia
if
i
can
drag
lady
kirkbank
to
the
house
of
the
enemy
we
will
be
there
on
this
smithson
discreetly
murmured
took
up
his
hat
and
cane
and
departed
without
in
sir
george
parlance
having
turned
a
hair
number
one
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
downstairs
with
his
leisurely
catlike
pace
that
velvet
step
by
which
he
had
gradually
crept
into
society
may
have
to
go
through
refusal
number
two
and
number
three
but
she
means
to
have
me
she
is
a
very
clever
girl
for
a
countrybred
one
and
she
knows
that
it
is
worth
her
while
to
be
lady
lesbia
smithson
this
soliloquy
may
be
taken
to
prove
that
horace
smithson
knew
lesbia
haselden
better
than
she
knew
herself
she
had
refused
him
in
all
good
faith
but
even
after
he
had
left
her
she
fell
into
a
in
which
smithson
houses
and
yachts
drags
and
hunters
formed
the
shifting
pictures
in
a
dissolving
view
of
society
and
lesbia
wondered
if
there
were
any
other
young
woman
in
london
who
would
refuse
such
an
offer
as
that
which
she
had
quietly
rejected
ago
lady
kirkbank
surprised
her
while
she
was
still
absorbed
in
this
dreamy
review
of
the
position
it
is
just
possible
that
the
fair
georgie
may
have
had
notice
of
smithson
morning
visit
and
may
have
kept
out
of
the
way
on
purpose
for
she
was
not
a
person
of
lazy
habits
and
was
generally
ready
for
her
nine
breakfast
and
her
morning
stroll
in
the
park
however
late
she
might
have
been
out
overnight
smithson
has
been
here
i
understand
said
lady
kirkbank
settling
herself
in
an
by
the
open
window
after
she
had
kissed
her
passed
him
on
the
stairs
is
always
passing
people
on
the
stairs
answered
lesbia
rather
pettishly
think
she
must
spend
her
life
on
the
landing
listening
for
arrivals
and
departures
had
a
kind
of
vague
idea
that
smithson
would
call
he
was
so
fussy
about
those
tickets
for
the
metzikoff
recital
i
hate
pianoforte
recitals
and
i
detest
that
starched
old
duchess
but
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
take
you
there
or
poor
smithson
will
be
miserable
said
lady
kirkbank
watching
lesbia
keenly
over
the
top
of
the
newspaper
she
expected
lesbia
to
confide
in
her
to
announce
herself
blushingly
as
the
betrothed
of
one
of
the
richest
commoners
in
england
but
lesbia
sat
gazing
dreamily
across
the
flowers
in
the
balcony
at
the
house
over
the
way
and
said
never
a
word
so
lady
kirkbank
curiosity
burst
into
speech
my
dear
has
he
proposed
there
was
something
in
his
manner
last
night
when
he
put
on
your
wraps
that
made
me
think
the
crisis
was
near
crisis
is
come
and
is
past
and
smithson
and
i
are
just
as
good
friends
as
ever
screamed
lady
kirkbank
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
refused
him
you
know
i
never
meant
to
do
anything
else
did
you
think
i
was
like
miss
trinder
bent
upon
marrying
town
and
country
houses
stables
and
diamonds
did
not
think
you
were
a
fool
cried
lady
kirkbank
almost
beside
herself
with
vexation
for
it
had
been
borne
in
upon
her
as
the
methodists
sometimes
say
that
if
smithson
should
prosper
in
his
wooing
it
would
be
better
for
her
lady
kirkbank
who
would
have
a
claim
upon
his
kindness
ever
after
can
be
your
motive
in
refusing
one
of
the
very
best
matches
of
the
season
or
of
ever
so
many
seasons
you
think
perhaps
you
will
marry
a
duke
if
you
wait
long
enough
for
his
grace
to
appear
but
the
number
of
marrying
dukes
is
rather
small
lady
lesbia
and
i
do
think
any
of
those
would
care
to
marry
lord
maulevrier
granddaughter
lesbia
started
to
her
feet
pale
as
ashes
do
you
fling
my
grandfather
name
in
my
face
and
with
that
diabolical
sneer
she
exclaimed
i
have
asked
you
about
him
you
have
always
evaded
my
questions
why
should
a
man
of
the
highest
rank
shrink
from
marrying
lord
maulevrier
granddaughter
my
grandfather
was
a
distinguished
man
governor
of
madras
such
posts
are
not
given
to
nobodies
how
can
you
dare
to
speak
as
if
it
were
a
disgrace
to
me
to
belong
to
him
chapter
xxviii
diamonds
hearts
in
wild
disorder
seen
lady
kirkbank
had
considerable
difficulty
in
smoothing
lesbia
ruffled
plumage
she
did
all
in
her
power
to
undo
the
effect
of
her
rash
words
declared
that
she
had
been
carried
away
by
temper
she
had
spoken
she
knew
not
what
words
of
no
meaning
of
course
lesbia
grandfather
had
been
a
great
man
governor
of
madras
altogether
an
important
and
celebrated
person
and
lady
kirkbank
had
meant
nothing
could
have
meant
nothing
to
his
disparagement
dearest
girl
i
was
beside
myself
and
talked
sheer
nonsense
said
georgie
you
know
really
now
dearest
any
woman
of
the
world
would
be
provoked
at
your
foolish
refusal
of
that
dear
good
smithson
only
think
of
that
too
lovely
house
in
park
lane
a
palace
in
the
style
of
the
italian
renaissance
such
a
house
is
in
itself
equivalent
to
a
peerage
and
there
is
no
doubt
smithson
will
be
offered
a
peerage
before
he
is
much
older
i
have
heard
it
confidently
asserted
that
when
the
present
ministry
retires
smithson
will
be
made
a
peer
you
have
no
idea
what
a
useful
man
he
is
or
what
henchman
service
he
has
done
the
ministry
in
financial
matters
and
then
there
is
his
villa
at
deauville
you
do
know
deauville
a
positively
perfect
place
the
villa
i
mean
built
by
the
duke
de
morny
in
the
golden
days
of
the
empire
and
another
at
cowes
and
his
palace
in
berkshire
a
manor
my
love
with
a
glorious
old
tudor
and
he
has
a
à
in
paris
in
the
faubourg
a
furnished
in
the
pompeian
style
rooms
opening
one
out
of
the
other
and
surrounding
a
small
garden
with
a
fountain
in
the
middle
some
of
the
greatest
people
in
paris
occupy
the
upper
part
of
the
house
and
their
rooms
of
course
are
splendid
but
smithson
is
the
gem
of
the
faubourg
however
i
suppose
there
is
no
use
in
talking
any
more
for
there
is
the
gong
for
luncheon
lesbia
was
in
no
humour
for
luncheon
would
rather
have
a
cup
of
tea
in
my
own
room
she
said
smithson
business
has
given
me
an
abominable
headache
you
will
go
to
hear
metzikoff
thanks
you
detest
the
duchess
of
lostwithiel
and
you
do
care
for
pianoforte
recitals
why
should
i
drag
you
there
my
dearest
lesbia
i
am
not
such
a
selfish
wretch
as
to
keep
you
at
home
when
i
know
you
are
passionately
fond
of
good
music
forget
all
about
your
headache
and
let
me
see
how
that
lovely
little
catherine
of
aragon
bonnet
suits
you
i
so
glad
i
happened
to
see
it
in
hands
yesterday
just
as
she
was
going
to
send
it
to
lady
fonvielle
who
gives
herself
such
intolerable
airs
on
the
strength
of
a
pretty
face
and
always
wants
to
get
the
in
bonnets
and
things
new
bonnet
replied
lesbia
an
infinity
of
things
i
seem
to
be
having
from
seraphine
i
afraid
i
must
owe
her
a
good
deal
of
money
this
was
a
vague
way
of
speaking
about
actual
facts
lady
lesbia
might
have
spoken
with
more
certainty
her
wardrobes
and
hanging
closets
and
chests
of
drawers
in
arlington
street
were
crammed
to
overflowing
with
finery
and
then
there
were
all
the
things
that
she
had
grown
tired
of
or
had
thought
unbecoming
and
had
given
away
to
kibble
her
own
maid
or
to
rilboche
who
had
in
a
great
measure
superseded
kibble
on
all
important
occasions
for
how
could
a
westmoreland
girl
know
how
to
dress
a
young
lady
for
london
balls
and
you
had
only
accepted
smithson
it
would
not
matter
how
much
money
you
owed
people
said
lady
kirkbank
had
better
come
down
to
lunch
a
glass
of
heidseck
will
bring
you
up
to
concert
pitch
champagne
was
lady
kirkbank
idea
of
a
universal
panacea
and
she
had
gradually
succeeded
in
teaching
lesbia
to
believe
in
the
sovereign
power
of
heidseck
as
a
restorative
for
shattered
nerves
at
fellside
lesbia
had
drunk
only
water
but
then
at
fellside
she
had
never
known
that
feeling
of
exhaustion
and
prostration
which
follows
days
and
nights
spent
in
society
the
wear
and
tear
of
a
mind
forever
on
the
alert
and
brilliant
spirits
which
are
more
often
forced
than
real
for
her
chief
stimulant
lesbia
had
recourse
to
the
teapot
but
there
were
occasions
when
she
found
that
something
more
than
tea
was
needed
to
maintain
that
indispensable
vivacity
of
manner
which
lady
kirkbank
called
concert
pitch
she
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
she
went
down
to
luncheon
and
took
a
couple
of
glasses
of
dry
champagne
with
her
cutlet
and
thus
restored
was
equal
to
putting
on
the
new
bonnet
which
was
so
becoming
that
her
spirits
revived
as
she
contemplated
the
effect
in
her
glass
so
lady
kirkbank
carried
her
off
to
the
musical
beaming
and
radiant
having
forgotten
all
about
that
dark
hint
of
evil
glancing
at
the
name
of
her
long
dead
grandfather
the
duchess
was
not
on
view
when
lady
kirkbank
and
her
arrived
and
a
good
many
people
belonging
to
georgie
own
particular
set
were
scattered
like
flowers
among
those
real
who
had
come
solely
to
hear
the
new
pianiste
the
were
mostly
dowdy
in
their
attire
and
seemed
a
race
apart
among
them
were
several
young
women
of
the
blessed
damozel
school
who
wore
flowing
garments
of
or
ochre
or
puffed
raiment
of
venetian
red
and
among
whom
the
cartwheel
hat
the
elizabethan
sleeve
and
the
toby
frill
were
conspicuous
there
were
very
few
men
except
the
musical
critics
in
this
select
assemblage
and
lesbia
began
to
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
very
dreary
she
had
lived
in
such
an
atmosphere
of
masculine
adulation
while
under
lady
kirkbank
wing
that
it
was
a
new
thing
to
find
herself
in
a
room
where
there
were
none
to
love
and
very
few
to
praise
her
she
felt
out
in
the
cold
as
it
were
those
ungloved
critics
with
their
shabby
coats
and
dubious
shirts
snuffy
smoky
everything
they
ought
not
to
be
seemed
to
her
a
race
of
barbarians
finding
herself
thus
cold
and
lonely
in
the
midst
of
the
splendour
of
velvet
and
decoration
lesbia
was
almost
glad
when
in
the
middle
of
madame
metzikoff
opening
gondolied
airy
fairy
music
executed
with
surpassing
delicacy
smithson
crept
gently
into
the
just
behind
hers
and
leant
over
the
back
of
the
chair
to
whisper
an
inquiry
as
to
her
opinion
of
the
pianist
style
is
exquisite
lesbia
murmured
softly
but
the
whispered
question
and
the
murmured
answer
low
as
they
were
provoked
indignant
looks
from
a
brace
of
damsels
in
venetian
red
who
shook
their
toby
frills
with
an
outraged
air
lesbia
felt
that
smithson
presence
was
hardly
correct
it
would
have
been
form
if
he
had
stayed
away
and
yet
she
was
glad
to
have
him
here
at
the
worst
he
was
some
one
nay
according
to
lady
kirkbank
he
was
the
only
one
amongst
all
her
admirers
whose
offer
was
worth
having
all
lesbia
other
conquests
had
counted
as
barren
honour
but
if
she
could
have
brought
herself
to
accept
smithson
she
would
have
secured
the
very
best
match
of
the
season
to
marry
a
plain
smithson
a
man
who
had
made
his
money
in
iron
in
cochineal
on
the
stock
exchange
had
seemed
to
her
absolute
degradation
the
surrender
of
all
her
lofty
hopes
her
golden
dreams
but
lady
kirkbank
had
put
the
question
in
a
new
light
when
she
said
that
smithson
would
be
offered
a
peerage
smithson
the
peer
would
be
altogether
a
different
person
from
smithson
the
commoner
but
was
lady
kirkbank
sure
of
her
facts
or
truthful
in
her
statement
lesbia
experience
of
her
chaperon
somewhat
loose
notions
of
truth
and
exactitude
made
her
doubtful
upon
this
point
be
this
as
it
might
she
was
inclined
to
be
civil
to
smithson
albeit
she
was
inwardly
surprised
and
offended
at
his
taking
her
refusal
so
calmly
see
that
i
am
determined
not
to
lose
the
privilege
of
your
society
because
i
have
been
foolish
he
said
presently
in
the
pause
after
the
first
part
of
the
recital
hope
you
will
consider
me
as
much
your
friend
as
i
was
yesterday
as
much
she
answered
sweetly
and
then
they
talked
of
raff
and
rubenstein
and
henselt
and
all
the
composers
about
whom
it
is
the
correct
thing
to
discourse
nowadays
before
they
left
belgrave
square
lady
kirkbank
had
offered
smithson
sir
george
place
in
her
box
at
the
gaiety
that
evening
and
had
invited
him
to
supper
in
arlington
street
afterwards
it
was
sarah
bernhardt
first
season
in
london
the
season
of
the
comédie
française
should
love
of
all
things
to
be
there
said
smithson
meekly
he
had
a
couple
of
stalls
in
the
third
row
for
the
whole
of
the
season
how
can
i
be
sure
that
i
shall
not
be
turning
sir
george
out
of
doors
george
can
never
sit
out
a
serious
play
he
only
cares
for
chaumont
or
judie
the
is
much
too
prosy
for
him
is
one
of
the
finest
plays
in
the
french
language
said
smithson
know
it
of
course
lady
lesbia
no
at
fellside
i
was
not
allowed
to
read
french
plays
or
novels
or
only
a
novel
now
and
then
which
my
grandmother
selected
for
me
now
you
read
everything
i
suppose
including
zola
books
are
lying
about
and
i
dip
into
them
sometimes
while
i
am
having
my
hair
brushed
answered
lesbia
lightly
believe
that
is
the
only
time
ladies
devote
to
literature
during
the
season
said
smithson
i
envy
you
the
delight
of
seeing
the
without
knowing
what
it
is
all
about
beforehand
daresay
there
are
a
good
many
people
who
would
not
take
their
girls
to
see
a
play
by
dumas
said
lady
kirkbank
i
make
a
point
of
letting
girls
see
everything
it
widens
their
minds
and
awakens
their
intelligence
does
away
with
a
good
many
silly
prejudices
replied
smithson
lady
kirkbank
and
lesbia
were
due
at
a
kensington
after
the
recital
and
from
the
for
which
any
hour
sufficed
they
went
to
show
themselves
in
the
park
then
back
to
arlington
street
to
dress
for
the
play
then
a
hurried
dinner
and
they
were
in
their
places
at
the
theatre
in
time
for
the
rising
of
the
curtain
it
were
an
english
play
we
would
not
care
for
being
punctual
said
lady
kirkbank
i
should
hate
to
lose
a
word
of
dumas
in
his
plays
every
speech
tells
there
were
royalties
present
and
the
house
was
good
but
not
so
full
as
it
had
been
on
some
other
nights
for
the
english
public
had
been
told
that
sarah
bernhardt
was
the
person
to
admire
and
had
been
flocking
after
that
enchantress
whereby
many
of
these
sheep
fighting
greedily
for
sarah
nights
and
ignoring
all
other
talent
lost
some
of
the
finest
acting
on
the
french
stage
notably
that
of
croizette
delaunay
and
febvre
in
this
very
lesbia
who
in
spite
of
her
affectations
was
still
fresh
enough
to
be
charmed
with
fine
acting
and
a
powerful
play
was
enthralled
by
the
stage
so
wrapt
in
the
scene
that
she
was
quite
unaware
of
her
brother
presence
in
a
stall
just
below
lady
kirkbank
box
he
too
had
a
stall
at
the
gaiety
he
had
come
in
very
late
when
the
play
was
half
over
lesbia
was
surprised
when
he
presented
himself
at
the
door
of
the
box
after
the
fourth
act
maulevrier
and
his
sister
had
met
very
seldom
since
the
young
the
young
earl
did
not
go
to
many
parties
and
the
society
he
cultivated
was
chiefly
masculine
and
as
he
neither
played
polo
nor
shot
pigeons
his
masculine
pursuits
did
not
bring
him
in
his
sister
way
lady
kirkbank
had
asked
him
to
her
house
with
that
wide
and
general
invitation
which
is
so
easily
evaded
he
had
promised
to
go
and
he
had
not
gone
and
thus
lesbia
and
he
had
pursued
their
several
ways
only
crossing
each
other
paths
now
and
then
at
a
race
meeting
or
in
a
theatre
d
do
lady
kirkbank
how
d
do
lesbia
just
caught
sight
of
you
from
below
as
the
curtain
was
going
down
said
maulevrier
shaking
hands
with
the
ladies
and
saluting
smithson
with
a
somewhat
supercilious
nod
surprised
to
see
you
and
lesbia
here
lady
kirkbank
is
the
rather
strong
meat
for
babes
eh
not
the
play
one
would
take
a
young
lady
to
see
should
a
young
lady
be
forbidden
to
see
a
fine
play
because
there
are
some
hard
and
bitter
truths
told
in
it
asked
lady
kirkbank
sees
madame
and
all
her
sisterhood
in
the
park
and
about
london
every
day
of
her
life
why
should
not
she
see
them
on
the
stage
and
hear
their
history
and
understand
how
cruel
their
fate
is
and
learn
to
pity
them
if
she
can
i
really
think
this
play
is
a
lesson
in
christian
charity
and
i
should
like
to
see
that
oliver
man
strangled
though
delaunay
plays
the
part
divinely
what
a
voice
what
a
manner
how
polished
how
perfect
and
they
tell
me
he
is
going
to
leave
the
stage
in
a
year
or
two
what
will
the
world
do
without
him
maulevrier
did
not
attempt
to
suggest
a
solution
of
this
difficulty
he
was
watching
smithson
as
he
leant
against
the
back
of
lesbia
chair
and
talked
to
her
the
two
seemed
very
familiar
laughingly
discussing
the
play
and
the
actors
smithson
knew
or
pretended
to
know
all
about
the
latter
he
told
lesbia
who
made
croizette
gowns
the
upholsterer
who
furnished
that
lovely
house
of
hers
in
the
bois
the
sums
paid
for
her
horses
her
pictures
her
diamonds
it
seemed
to
lesbia
when
she
had
heard
all
that
croizette
was
a
person
smithson
had
unpublished
of
dumas
at
his
finger
ends
he
knew
daudet
and
sarcey
and
sardou
and
seemed
to
be
thoroughly
at
home
in
parisian
artistic
society
lesbia
began
to
think
that
he
would
hardly
be
so
despicable
a
person
as
she
had
at
first
supposed
no
wonder
he
and
his
wealth
had
turned
poor
belle
trinder
head
how
could
a
rural
vicar
daughter
accustomed
to
poverty
help
being
dazzled
by
such
magnificence
maulevrier
stayed
in
the
box
only
a
short
time
and
refused
lady
kirkbank
invitation
to
supper
she
did
not
urge
the
point
as
she
had
surprised
one
or
two
very
unfriendly
glances
at
smithson
in
maulevrier
honest
eyes
she
did
not
want
an
antagonistic
brother
to
interfere
with
her
plans
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
lesbia
according
to
her
own
ideas
and
any
counter
influence
might
be
fatal
so
when
maulevrier
said
he
was
due
at
the
marlborough
after
the
play
she
let
him
go
might
as
well
be
at
fellside
and
you
in
london
for
anything
i
see
of
you
said
lesbia
are
up
to
your
eyes
in
engagements
and
i
do
suppose
you
want
to
see
any
more
of
me
maulevrier
answered
bluntly
i
call
morning
if
i
am
likely
to
find
you
at
home
i
some
news
for
you
i
stay
at
home
on
purpose
to
see
you
news
is
always
delightful
is
it
good
news
good
at
least
i
think
so
is
it
about
that
a
long
story
and
the
curtain
is
just
going
up
the
news
is
about
mary
mary
exclaimed
lesbia
elevating
her
eyebrows
news
can
there
possibly
be
about
mary
news
as
there
generally
is
about
every
nice
jolly
girl
at
least
once
in
her
life
do
mean
that
she
is
engaged
to
a
curate
not
to
a
curate
there
goes
the
curtain
i
see
you
later
as
the
yankee
president
used
to
say
when
people
bothered
him
and
he
like
to
say
no
engaged
mary
engaged
the
idea
of
such
an
altogether
unexpected
event
distracted
lesbia
mind
all
through
the
last
act
of
the
she
hardly
knew
what
the
actors
were
talking
about
mary
her
younger
sister
mary
a
good
looking
girl
enough
but
by
no
means
a
beauty
and
with
manners
utterly
unformed
that
mary
should
be
engaged
to
be
married
while
she
lesbia
was
still
free
seemed
an
obvious
absurdity
and
yet
the
fact
was
on
reflection
easily
to
be
accounted
for
these
unattractive
girls
are
generally
the
first
to
bind
themselves
with
the
vows
of
betrothal
lady
kirkbank
had
told
her
of
many
such
cases
the
poor
creatures
know
that
their
chances
will
be
few
and
therefore
gratefully
welcome
the
first
wooer
who
can
the
man
be
thought
lesbia
has
been
kept
as
secluded
as
a
cloistered
nun
there
are
so
few
families
we
have
ever
been
allowed
to
mix
with
the
man
must
be
a
curate
who
has
taken
advantage
of
grandmother
illness
to
force
his
way
into
the
family
circle
at
fellside
and
who
has
made
love
to
mary
in
some
of
her
lonely
rambles
over
the
hills
i
daresay
it
is
really
very
wrong
to
allow
a
girl
to
roam
about
in
that
way
sir
george
and
a
couple
of
his
horsey
friends
were
waiting
for
supper
when
lady
kirkbank
and
her
party
arrived
in
arlington
street
the
looked
a
picture
of
comfort
the
oval
table
the
low
lamps
the
clusters
of
candles
under
coloured
shades
the
great
oriental
bowl
of
wild
flowers
eglantine
honeysuckle
foxglove
all
the
sweet
hedge
flowers
of
midsummer
made
a
central
mass
of
colour
and
brightness
against
the
subdued
and
even
sombre
tones
of
walls
and
curtains
the
room
was
old
the
furniture
old
nothing
had
been
altered
since
the
time
of
sir
george
great
grandfather
and
the
whirligig
of
time
had
just
now
made
the
old
things
precious
yes
those
chairs
and
tables
and
sideboards
and
bookcases
and
against
which
georgie
soul
had
revolted
in
the
early
years
of
her
wedded
life
were
now
things
of
beauty
and
georgie
friends
envied
her
the
possession
of
indisputable
chippendale
furniture
mostyn
a
distinguished
owner
of
with
his
pretty
wife
made
up
the
party
the
gentleman
was
full
of
his
entries
for
liverpool
and
chester
and
discoursed
mysteriously
with
sir
george
and
the
horsey
bachelors
all
supper
time
the
lady
had
lately
taken
up
science
as
a
new
form
of
excitement
not
incompatible
with
frocks
bonnets
hurlingham
the
ranelagh
and
sandown
she
raved
about
huxley
and
tyndall
and
was
perpetually
coming
down
upon
her
friends
with
awful
facts
about
the
sun
and
startling
propositions
about
latent
heat
or
spontaneous
generation
she
knew
all
about
gases
and
would
hardly
accept
a
glass
of
water
without
explaining
what
it
was
made
of
drawn
by
smithson
for
lesbia
amusement
the
scientific
matron
was
undoubtedly
fun
the
racing
men
were
full
of
talk
lesbia
and
lady
kirkbank
raved
about
the
play
they
had
just
been
seeing
and
praised
delaunay
with
an
enthusiasm
which
was
calculated
to
make
the
rest
of
mankind
burst
with
envy
you
know
you
are
making
me
positively
wretched
by
your
talk
about
that
man
said
colonel
delville
one
of
sir
george
racing
friends
and
an
ancient
adorer
of
the
fair
georgie
i
tell
you
there
was
never
anything
offered
higher
than
five
to
four
on
the
mare
interjectionally
to
sir
george
was
a
day
when
i
thought
i
was
your
idea
of
an
attractive
man
yes
george
a
clear
case
of
roping
again
interjectionally
to
hear
you
raving
about
this
fellow
it
is
too
humiliating
lady
kirkbank
simpered
and
then
sighed
are
getting
old
together
she
murmured
have
come
to
an
age
when
one
can
only
admire
the
charm
of
manner
in
the
abstract
the
beautiful
for
the
sake
of
the
beautiful
i
think
if
i
were
lying
in
my
grave
the
music
of
delaunay
voice
would
thrill
me
under
six
feet
of
london
clay
will
no
one
take
any
more
wine
no
then
we
may
as
well
go
into
the
next
room
and
begin
our
little
nap
the
adjoining
room
was
sir
george
snuggery
and
it
was
here
that
the
cosy
little
round
games
after
supper
were
always
played
sir
george
was
not
a
studious
person
he
never
read
and
he
never
wrote
except
an
occasional
cheque
on
account
for
an
importunate
tradesman
his
correspondence
was
conducted
by
the
telegraph
or
telephone
and
the
room
therefore
was
absorbed
neither
by
books
nor
writing
desks
it
was
furnished
solely
with
a
view
to
comfort
there
was
a
round
table
in
the
centre
under
a
large
moderator
lamp
which
gave
an
exceptionally
brilliant
light
a
divan
covered
with
dark
brown
velvet
occupied
three
sides
of
the
room
a
few
choice
pieces
of
old
blue
oriental
ware
in
the
corners
enlivened
the
dark
brown
walls
three
or
four
easy
chairs
stood
about
near
the
broad
fireplace
which
had
been
improved
with
a
brass
grate
and
a
blue
and
white
tiled
hearth
is
a
room
in
my
house
that
looks
half
as
comfortable
as
this
den
of
yours
george
said
smithson
as
he
seated
himself
by
lesbia
side
at
the
card
table
they
had
agreed
to
be
partners
at
cards
even
if
we
are
not
to
be
partners
for
life
smithson
had
whispered
tenderly
and
only
reply
had
been
a
modest
lowering
of
lovely
eyelids
and
a
faint
faint
blush
lesbia
blushes
were
growing
fainter
every
day
is
because
everything
in
your
house
is
so
confoundedly
handsome
and
expensive
retorted
sir
george
who
did
not
very
much
care
about
being
called
george
by
a
person
of
smithson
obscure
antecedents
but
who
had
to
endure
the
familiarity
for
reasons
known
only
to
himself
and
smithson
man
can
expect
to
be
comfortable
in
a
house
in
which
every
room
has
cost
a
small
fortune
my
wife
this
den
years
ago
when
we
took
to
sittin
here
of
an
evenin
she
picked
up
the
chairs
and
the
blue
pots
at
bonham
had
everythin
covered
with
brown
velvet
nice
subdued
tone
suit
old
people
hung
up
that
yaller
curtain
just
for
a
bit
of
colour
and
here
we
are
the
cosiest
room
in
town
said
colonel
delville
whereupon
mostyn
while
counters
were
being
distributed
explained
to
the
company
on
scientific
principles
the
room
was
comfortable
expatiating
upon
the
effect
of
yellow
and
brown
upon
the
retina
and
some
curious
facts
relating
to
the
optic
machinery
of
as
lately
discovered
by
a
great
naturalist
unfortunately
for
science
the
game
had
now
begun
and
the
players
were
curiously
indifferent
as
to
the
visual
organs
of
the
game
went
on
merrily
till
the
pearly
lights
of
dawn
began
to
creep
through
the
chinks
of
lady
kirkbank
yellow
curtain
everybody
seemed
gay
yet
everybody
could
not
be
winning
fortune
had
not
smiled
upon
lesbia
cards
or
on
those
of
her
partner
the
smithson
and
haselden
firm
had
come
to
grief
lesbia
little
ivory
purse
had
been
emptied
of
its
three
or
four
and
smithson
had
been
capitalising
a
losing
concern
for
the
last
two
hours
and
the
play
had
been
fast
and
furious
although
nominally
for
small
stakes
am
afraid
to
think
of
how
much
i
must
owe
you
said
lesbia
when
smithson
bade
her
good
night
nothing
worth
speaking
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
pounds
at
most
lesbia
felt
cold
and
creepy
and
hardly
knew
whether
it
was
the
chill
of
day
or
the
sense
of
owing
money
to
horace
smithson
those
three
or
four
were
the
end
of
her
last
remittance
from
lady
maulevrier
she
had
had
a
great
many
remittances
from
that
generous
grandmother
and
the
money
had
all
gone
somehow
it
was
gone
and
yet
she
had
paid
for
hardly
anything
she
had
accounts
with
all
lady
kirkbank
tradesmen
the
money
had
melted
away
it
had
oozed
out
of
her
pockets
at
cards
on
the
in
reckless
gifts
to
servants
and
people
at
fancy
fairs
for
trifles
bought
here
and
there
by
the
as
it
were
for
the
sake
of
buying
if
she
had
been
suddenly
asked
for
an
account
of
her
stewardship
she
could
not
have
told
what
she
had
done
with
half
of
the
money
and
now
she
must
ask
for
twenty
pounds
more
and
immediately
to
pay
smithson
she
went
up
to
her
room
in
the
clear
early
light
and
stood
like
a
statue
with
fixed
thoughtful
eyes
while
kibble
took
off
her
finery
the
pretty
pale
yellow
gown
which
set
off
her
dark
brown
hair
her
violet
eyes
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
the
keen
pang
of
anxiety
about
money
matters
the
necessity
to
think
of
ways
and
means
she
had
no
idea
how
much
money
she
had
received
from
her
grandmother
since
she
had
begun
her
career
in
scotland
last
autumn
the
cheques
had
been
sent
her
as
she
asked
for
them
sometimes
even
before
she
asked
for
them
and
she
had
kept
no
account
she
thought
her
grandmother
was
so
rich
that
expenditure
could
not
matter
she
supposed
that
she
was
drawing
upon
an
inexhaustible
supply
and
now
lady
kirkbank
had
told
her
that
lady
maulevrier
was
not
rich
as
the
world
reckons
nowadays
the
savings
of
a
dowager
countess
even
in
forty
years
of
seclusion
could
be
but
a
small
fund
to
draw
upon
for
the
expenses
of
life
at
high
pressure
sums
people
spend
nowadays
are
positively
appalling
said
lady
kirkbank
man
with
five
or
six
thousand
a
year
is
an
absolute
pauper
i
sure
our
existence
is
only
genteel
beggary
and
yet
we
spend
over
ten
thousand
enlightened
thus
by
the
lips
of
the
lesbia
thought
ruefully
of
the
bills
which
her
grandmother
would
have
to
pay
for
her
at
the
end
of
the
season
bills
of
the
amount
whereof
she
could
not
even
make
an
approximate
guess
seraphine
charges
had
never
been
discussed
in
her
hearing
but
lady
kirkbank
had
admitted
that
the
creature
was
dear
chapter
xxix
subtle
post
carrier
of
grisly
care
maulevrier
called
in
arlington
street
before
twelve
next
day
and
found
lesbia
just
returning
from
her
early
ride
looking
as
fresh
and
fair
as
if
there
had
been
no
such
thing
as
nap
or
late
hours
in
the
story
of
her
life
she
was
reposing
in
a
large
easy
chair
by
the
open
window
in
habit
and
hat
just
as
she
had
come
from
the
row
where
she
had
been
laughing
and
chatting
with
smithson
who
jogged
demurely
by
her
side
on
his
hunter
dropping
out
envenomed
little
jokes
about
the
passers
by
people
who
saw
him
riding
by
her
side
upon
this
particular
morning
fancied
there
was
something
more
than
usual
in
the
gentleman
manner
and
made
up
their
minds
that
lady
lesbia
haselden
was
to
be
mistress
of
the
fine
house
in
park
lane
smithson
had
fluttered
and
fluttered
for
the
last
five
seasons
but
this
time
the
flutterer
was
caught
in
her
anxiety
about
money
matters
lesbia
had
forgotten
mary
engagement
but
the
sight
of
maulevrier
recalled
the
fact
over
here
and
sit
down
she
said
tell
me
this
nonsense
about
mary
i
am
expiring
with
curiosity
the
thing
is
too
absurd
absurd
asked
maulevrier
sitting
where
she
bade
him
and
studiously
perusing
the
name
in
his
hat
as
if
it
were
a
revelation
for
a
thousand
reasons
answered
lesbia
switching
the
flowers
in
the
balcony
with
her
light
little
whip
and
foremost
it
is
absurd
to
think
of
any
one
so
buried
alive
as
poor
mary
is
finding
an
admirer
and
secondly
well
i
do
want
to
be
rude
to
my
own
sister
but
mary
is
not
particularly
attractive
is
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
likely
i
only
said
that
she
is
not
particularly
attractive
do
you
think
there
is
no
attraction
in
goodness
in
freshness
and
innocence
candour
generosity
do
know
but
i
think
that
if
mary
nose
had
been
a
thought
longer
and
if
she
had
kept
her
skin
free
from
freckles
she
would
have
been
almost
pretty
you
really
luckily
for
mary
the
man
who
is
going
to
marry
her
thinks
her
lovely
suppose
he
likes
freckles
i
once
heard
a
man
say
he
did
he
said
they
were
so
original
so
much
character
about
them
and
pray
who
is
the
man
old
adorer
and
my
dear
friend
john
hammond
lesbia
turned
as
pale
as
death
pale
with
rage
and
mortification
it
was
not
jealousy
this
pang
which
rent
her
shallow
soul
she
had
ceased
to
care
for
john
hammond
the
whirlpool
of
society
had
spun
that
first
fancy
out
of
her
giddy
brain
but
that
a
man
who
had
loved
the
highest
who
had
worshipped
her
the
peerless
the
beautiful
should
calmly
transfer
his
affections
to
her
younger
sister
was
to
the
last
degree
exasperating
friend
hammond
must
be
a
fickle
fool
she
exclaimed
does
not
know
his
own
mind
from
day
to
day
but
it
was
more
than
a
day
after
you
rejected
him
that
he
engaged
himself
to
molly
it
was
all
my
doing
and
i
am
proud
of
my
work
i
took
the
poor
fellow
back
to
fellside
last
march
bruised
and
broken
by
your
cruel
treatment
heartsore
and
depressed
i
gave
him
over
to
molly
and
molly
cured
him
unconsciously
innocently
she
won
that
noble
heart
ah
lesbia
you
do
know
what
a
heart
it
is
which
you
so
nearly
broke
in
our
rank
of
life
ca
afford
to
marry
noble
hearts
said
lesbia
scornfully
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
lady
maulevrier
consented
to
the
engagement
cut
up
rather
rough
at
first
but
molly
held
her
own
like
a
young
lioness
and
the
grandmother
gave
way
you
see
she
has
a
fixed
idea
that
molly
is
a
very
sort
of
person
compared
with
you
and
that
a
husband
who
was
not
nearly
good
enough
for
you
might
pass
muster
for
molly
and
so
she
gave
way
and
there
is
a
happier
young
woman
in
the
three
kingdoms
than
mary
haselden
are
they
to
live
upon
asked
lesbia
with
an
incredulous
air
will
have
her
five
hundred
a
year
and
hammond
is
a
very
clever
fellow
you
may
be
sure
he
will
make
his
mark
in
the
world
how
are
they
to
live
while
he
is
making
his
mark
five
hundred
a
year
wo
do
more
than
pay
for
mary
frocks
if
she
goes
into
society
they
will
live
without
society
some
horrid
little
hovel
in
one
of
those
narrow
streets
off
ecclestone
square
suggested
lesbia
shudderingly
is
too
dreadful
to
think
of
a
young
woman
dooming
herself
to
penury
just
because
she
is
so
foolish
as
to
fall
in
love
days
for
falling
in
love
are
over
i
suppose
lesbia
said
maulevrier
contemplating
his
sister
with
keen
scrutiny
the
beautiful
face
so
perfect
in
line
and
colour
curiously
recalled
that
other
face
at
fellside
the
dowager
face
with
its
look
of
marble
coldness
and
the
pain
under
that
outward
calm
here
was
the
face
of
one
who
had
not
yet
known
pain
or
passion
here
was
the
cold
perfection
of
beauty
with
unawakened
heart
do
know
i
am
too
busy
to
think
of
such
things
have
done
with
love
and
you
have
begun
to
think
of
marriage
of
establishing
yourself
properly
people
tell
me
you
are
going
to
marry
mr
smithson
tell
you
more
about
me
than
i
know
about
myself
now
lesbia
i
have
a
right
to
know
the
truth
upon
this
point
your
brother
your
only
brother
should
be
the
first
person
to
be
told
i
am
engaged
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
the
first
person
or
the
second
person
answered
lesbia
lightly
kirkbank
living
on
the
premises
is
likely
to
be
the
first
you
are
not
engaged
to
smithson
i
tell
you
so
just
now
smithson
did
me
the
honour
to
make
me
an
offer
yesterday
at
about
this
hour
and
i
did
myself
the
honour
to
reject
him
yet
you
were
whispering
together
in
the
box
last
night
and
you
were
riding
in
the
row
with
him
this
morning
i
just
met
a
fellow
who
saw
you
together
do
you
think
it
is
right
lesbia
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
man
to
encourage
him
if
you
do
mean
to
marry
him
can
you
accuse
me
of
encouraging
a
person
whom
i
flatly
refused
yesterday
morning
if
smithson
likes
my
society
as
a
friend
must
i
needs
deny
him
my
friendship
ask
lady
kirkbank
to
shut
her
door
against
him
smithson
is
very
pleasant
as
an
acquaintance
and
although
i
do
want
to
marry
him
there
no
reason
i
should
snub
him
is
not
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
you
will
find
yourself
entangled
in
a
web
which
you
wo
easily
break
through
am
not
afraid
of
webs
is
it
true
that
smithson
is
likely
to
get
a
peerage
have
heard
people
say
as
much
smithson
has
spent
no
end
of
money
on
electioneering
and
is
a
power
in
the
house
though
he
very
rarely
speaks
his
berkshire
estate
gives
him
a
good
deal
of
influence
in
that
county
at
the
last
general
election
he
subscribed
twenty
thou
to
the
conservative
cause
for
like
most
men
who
have
risen
from
nothing
your
friend
smithson
is
a
fine
old
tory
he
was
specially
elected
at
the
carlton
six
years
ago
and
has
made
himself
uncommonly
useful
to
his
party
he
is
supposed
to
be
great
on
financial
questions
and
comes
out
tremendously
on
colonial
railways
or
drainage
schemes
about
which
the
house
in
general
is
in
profound
ignorance
on
those
occasions
smithson
scores
high
a
man
with
immense
wealth
has
always
chances
no
doubt
if
you
were
to
marry
him
the
peerage
would
be
easily
managed
money
backed
by
the
maulevrier
influence
would
go
a
long
way
my
grandmother
would
move
heaven
and
earth
in
a
case
of
that
kind
you
had
better
take
pity
on
smithson
lesbia
laughed
that
idea
of
a
possible
peerage
elevated
smithson
in
her
eyes
she
knew
nothing
of
his
political
career
as
she
lived
in
a
set
which
ignored
politics
altogether
smithson
had
never
talked
to
her
of
his
parliamentary
duties
and
it
was
a
new
thing
for
her
to
hear
that
he
had
some
kind
of
influence
in
public
affairs
i
were
inclined
to
accept
him
would
you
like
him
as
a
she
asked
lightly
thought
from
your
manner
last
night
that
you
rather
disliked
him
do
quite
like
him
or
any
of
his
breed
the
newly
rich
who
go
about
in
society
swelling
with
the
sense
of
their
own
importance
perspiring
gold
as
it
were
and
one
has
always
a
faint
suspicion
of
men
who
have
got
rich
very
quickly
an
idea
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
juggling
not
in
the
case
of
a
great
contractor
perhaps
who
can
point
to
a
viaduct
and
docks
and
railways
and
say
i
built
that
and
that
and
that
these
are
the
sources
of
my
wealth
but
a
man
who
gets
enormously
rich
by
mere
ciphering
where
can
his
money
come
from
except
out
of
other
people
pockets
i
know
nothing
against
your
smithson
but
i
always
suspect
that
class
of
men
concluded
maulevrier
shaking
his
head
significantly
lesbia
was
not
much
influenced
by
her
brother
notions
she
had
never
been
taught
to
think
him
an
oracle
on
the
contrary
she
had
been
told
that
his
life
hitherto
had
been
all
foolishness
are
mary
and
hammond
to
be
married
she
asked
says
they
must
wait
a
year
mary
is
much
too
young
and
so
on
and
so
forth
but
i
see
no
reason
for
waiting
there
are
reasons
financial
reasons
hammond
can
not
be
in
a
position
to
begin
housekeeping
they
will
risk
all
that
molly
is
a
daring
girl
he
proposed
to
her
on
the
top
of
helvellyn
in
a
storm
of
wind
and
rain
she
never
wrote
me
a
word
about
it
how
very
unsisterly
is
as
wild
as
a
hawk
and
i
daresay
she
was
too
shy
to
tell
you
anything
about
it
when
did
it
all
occur
before
i
came
to
london
months
ago
how
absurd
for
me
to
be
in
ignorance
all
this
time
well
i
hope
mary
will
be
sensible
and
not
marry
till
hammond
is
able
to
give
her
a
decent
home
it
would
be
so
dreadful
to
have
a
sister
muddling
in
poverty
and
clamouring
for
one
gowns
maulevrier
laughed
at
this
gloomy
suggestion
is
not
easy
to
foretell
the
future
he
said
i
think
i
may
venture
to
promise
that
molly
will
never
wear
your
gowns
you
think
she
would
be
too
proud
you
do
know
perhaps
how
poverty
genteel
poverty
lowers
one
pride
i
have
heard
stories
from
lady
kirkbank
that
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
i
am
beginning
to
know
the
world
am
glad
of
that
if
you
are
to
live
in
the
world
it
is
better
that
you
should
know
what
it
is
made
of
but
if
i
had
a
voice
or
a
choice
in
the
matter
i
had
rather
my
sisters
stayed
at
grasmere
and
remained
ignorant
of
the
world
and
all
its
ways
you
enjoy
your
life
in
london
that
is
just
like
the
selfishness
of
a
man
under
the
pretence
of
keeping
his
sisters
or
his
wife
secure
from
all
possible
contact
with
evil
he
buries
them
alive
in
a
country
house
while
he
has
all
the
wickedness
for
his
own
share
in
london
oh
i
am
beginning
to
understand
the
creatures
am
afraid
you
are
beginning
to
be
wise
remember
that
knowledge
of
evil
was
the
prelude
to
the
fall
well
you
stay
to
lunch
thanks
i
never
lunch
frightful
waste
of
time
i
shall
drop
in
at
the
and
take
a
cup
of
tea
later
on
the
was
a
new
club
in
piccadilly
which
maulevrier
and
some
of
his
friends
affected
lesbia
went
towards
the
door
with
her
brother
and
just
as
he
reached
the
door
she
laid
her
hand
caressingly
upon
his
shoulder
he
turned
and
stared
at
her
somewhat
surprised
for
he
and
she
had
never
been
given
to
demonstrations
of
affection
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
she
said
in
a
low
voice
blushing
a
little
for
the
thing
she
was
going
to
ask
was
a
new
thing
for
her
to
ask
and
she
had
a
deep
sense
of
shame
in
making
her
demand
i
lost
money
at
nap
last
night
only
seventeen
pounds
smithson
and
i
were
partners
and
he
paid
my
losses
i
want
to
pay
him
immediately
and
you
are
too
hard
up
to
do
it
i
write
you
a
cheque
this
instant
said
maulevrier
goodnaturedly
but
while
he
was
writing
the
cheque
he
took
occasion
to
remonstrate
with
lesbia
on
the
foolishness
of
card
playing
am
obliged
to
do
as
lady
kirkbank
does
she
answered
feebly
i
were
to
refuse
to
play
it
would
be
a
kind
of
reproach
to
her
do
think
that
would
kill
lady
kirkbank
replied
maulevrier
with
a
touch
of
scorn
has
had
to
endure
a
good
many
implied
reproaches
in
her
day
and
they
do
seem
to
have
hurt
her
very
much
i
wish
to
heaven
my
grandmother
had
chosen
any
one
else
in
london
for
your
chaperon
afraid
lady
kirkbank
is
rather
a
rowdy
set
answered
lesbia
coolly
i
sometimes
feel
as
if
i
had
thrown
myself
away
we
go
almost
everywhere
at
least
there
are
only
just
a
few
houses
to
which
we
are
not
asked
but
those
few
make
all
the
difference
it
is
so
humiliating
to
feel
that
one
is
not
in
quite
the
best
society
however
lady
kirkbank
is
a
dear
good
old
thing
and
i
am
not
going
to
grumble
about
her
made
the
cheque
for
you
can
cash
it
at
your
milliner
said
maulevrier
should
not
like
smithson
to
know
that
you
had
been
obliged
to
ask
me
for
the
money
to
smithson
do
you
know
if
he
is
in
quite
the
best
society
asked
lesbia
do
know
what
you
mean
by
quite
the
best
a
man
of
wealth
can
generally
poke
his
nose
in
anywhere
if
he
knows
how
to
behave
himself
but
of
course
there
are
people
with
whom
money
and
fine
houses
have
no
weight
the
conservatives
are
all
civil
to
smithson
because
he
comes
down
handsomely
at
general
elections
and
is
useful
to
them
in
other
ways
i
believe
that
smithson
wife
if
she
were
a
one
could
go
into
any
society
she
liked
and
make
her
house
one
of
the
most
popular
in
london
perhaps
that
is
what
you
really
wanted
to
ask
it
was
answered
lesbia
carelessly
was
only
talking
for
the
sake
of
talking
a
thousand
thanks
for
the
cheque
you
best
of
brothers
is
not
worth
talking
about
but
lesbia
do
play
cards
any
more
believe
me
it
is
not
good
form
i
try
to
keep
out
of
it
in
future
it
is
horrid
to
see
sovereigns
melting
away
but
there
a
delightful
excitement
in
winning
doubt
answered
maulevrier
with
a
remorseful
sigh
he
spoke
as
a
reformed
plunger
and
with
many
a
bitter
experience
of
the
and
the
even
now
though
he
had
steadied
himself
wonderfully
he
could
not
get
on
without
a
little
mild
gambling
pool
whist
with
points
but
when
he
condescended
to
such
small
stakes
he
felt
that
he
had
settled
down
into
a
respectable
player
and
had
a
right
to
rebuke
the
follies
of
youth
lesbia
flew
to
the
piano
and
sang
one
of
her
little
german
ballads
directly
maulevrier
was
gone
she
felt
as
if
a
burden
had
been
lifted
from
her
soul
now
that
she
was
able
to
pay
smithson
without
waiting
to
ask
lady
maulevrier
for
the
money
and
as
she
sang
she
meditated
upon
maulevrier
remarks
about
smithson
he
knew
nothing
to
the
discredit
except
that
he
had
grown
rich
in
a
short
space
of
time
surely
no
man
ought
to
be
blamed
for
that
and
he
thought
that
smithson
wife
might
make
her
house
the
most
popular
in
london
lesbia
in
her
mind
eye
beheld
an
imaginary
lady
lesbia
smithson
giving
dances
in
that
magnificent
mansion
entertaining
royal
personages
and
the
doorways
would
be
festooned
with
roses
as
she
had
seen
them
the
other
night
at
a
ball
in
grosvenor
square
but
the
house
in
grosvenor
square
was
a
hovel
compared
with
the
smithsonian
palace
lesbia
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
tired
of
lady
kirkbank
and
her
surroundings
life
taken
is
apt
to
pall
lesbia
sighed
as
she
finished
her
little
song
she
was
beginning
to
look
upon
her
existence
as
a
problem
which
had
been
given
to
her
to
solve
and
the
solution
just
at
present
was
all
dark
as
she
rose
from
the
piano
a
footman
came
in
with
two
letters
on
a
salver
bulky
letters
such
packages
as
lesbia
had
never
seen
before
she
wondered
what
they
could
be
she
opened
the
thickest
envelope
first
it
was
seraphine
bill
such
a
bill
page
after
page
on
creamy
bath
post
written
in
an
elegant
italian
hand
by
one
of
seraphine
young
women
lesbia
looked
at
it
aghast
with
horror
the
total
at
the
foot
of
the
first
page
was
appalling
ever
so
much
more
than
she
could
have
supposed
the
whole
amount
of
her
indebtedness
but
the
total
went
on
increasing
at
the
foot
of
every
page
until
at
sight
of
the
final
figures
lesbia
gave
a
wild
shriek
like
a
wretched
creature
who
has
received
a
telegram
announcing
bitterest
loss
the
final
total
was
twelve
hundred
and
pounds
seventeen
and
sixpence
thirteen
hundred
pounds
for
clothes
in
eight
weeks
no
the
thing
was
a
cheat
a
mistake
they
had
sent
her
somebody
bill
she
had
not
had
half
these
things
she
read
the
first
page
her
heart
beating
violently
as
she
pored
over
the
figures
her
eyes
dim
and
clouded
with
the
trouble
of
her
brain
yes
there
was
her
court
dress
the
description
was
too
minute
to
be
mistaken
and
the
court
dress
with
feathers
and
shoes
and
gloves
and
fan
came
to
a
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
then
followed
innumerable
items
the
very
simplest
of
her
gowns
cost
pounds
frocks
about
which
seraphine
had
talked
so
carelessly
as
if
two
or
three
more
or
less
could
make
no
difference
bonnets
and
hats
at
five
or
seven
guineas
apiece
swelled
the
account
parasols
and
fans
were
of
fabulous
price
as
it
seemed
to
lesbia
and
the
shoes
and
stockings
to
match
her
various
gowns
occurred
again
and
again
between
the
more
important
items
like
the
refrain
of
an
old
ballad
all
the
useless
and
unnessary
things
which
she
had
ordered
because
she
thought
them
pretty
or
because
she
was
told
they
were
fashionable
rose
up
against
her
in
the
figures
of
the
bill
like
the
record
of
forgotten
sins
at
the
day
of
judgment
she
sank
into
a
chair
pallid
with
consternation
and
sat
with
the
bill
in
her
lap
turning
the
pages
listlessly
and
staring
at
the
figures
can
not
be
so
much
she
cried
to
herself
must
be
added
up
wrong
and
then
she
feebly
tried
to
cast
up
a
column
but
arithmetic
not
being
one
of
those
accomplishments
which
lady
maulevrier
deemed
necessary
to
a
patrician
beauty
success
in
life
lesbia
education
had
been
somewhat
neglected
upon
this
point
and
she
flung
the
bill
from
her
in
a
rage
unable
to
hold
the
figures
in
her
brain
she
opened
the
second
envelope
her
jeweller
account
at
the
very
first
item
she
gave
another
scream
fainter
than
the
first
for
her
mind
was
getting
hardened
against
such
shocks
a
suite
of
amethysts
with
finest
brazilian
brilliants
three
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
then
followed
the
trifles
she
had
bought
at
different
visits
to
the
shop
casual
purchases
bought
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
these
swelled
the
account
to
a
little
over
eight
hundred
pounds
lesbia
sat
like
a
statue
numbed
by
despair
appalled
at
the
idea
of
owing
over
two
thousand
pounds
chapter

choked
among
thorns
and
thistles
lady
lesbia
ate
no
luncheon
that
day
she
went
to
her
own
room
and
had
a
cup
of
tea
to
steady
her
nerves
and
sent
to
ask
lady
kirkbank
to
go
to
her
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
luncheon
lady
kirkbank
luncheon
was
a
serious
business
a
substantial
leisurely
meal
with
which
she
fortified
herself
for
the
day
work
it
enabled
her
to
endure
all
the
fatigues
of
visits
and
park
and
to
be
airily
indifferent
to
the
charms
of
dinner
for
lady
kirkbank
was
not
one
of
those
matrons
who
with
advanced
years
take
to
as
a
kind
of
fine
art
she
gave
good
dinners
because
she
knew
people
would
not
come
to
arlington
street
to
eat
bad
ones
but
she
was
not
a
person
who
lived
only
to
dine
at
luncheon
she
gave
her
healthy
appetite
full
scope
and
ate
like
a
ploughman
she
found
lesbia
in
her
white
muslin
with
cheeks
as
pale
as
the
gown
she
wore
she
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
with
a
low
at
her
side
and
the
two
bills
were
in
the
tray
among
the
you
any
idea
how
much
i
owe
seraphine
and
cabochon
she
asked
looking
up
despairingly
at
lady
kirkbank
have
they
sent
in
their
bills
already
i
wish
they
had
sent
them
before
i
should
have
known
how
deeply
i
was
getting
into
debt
they
very
heavy
are
dreadful
i
owe
over
two
thousand
pounds
how
can
i
tell
lady
maulevrier
that
two
thousand
one
hundred
pounds
it
is
awful
are
women
in
london
who
would
think
very
little
of
owing
twice
as
much
said
lady
kirkbank
in
a
comforting
tone
though
the
fact
seriously
considered
could
hardly
afford
comfort
grandmother
said
you
were
to
have
she
may
think
that
you
have
been
just
a
little
extravagant
but
she
can
hardly
be
angry
with
you
for
having
taken
her
at
her
word
two
thousand
pounds
yes
it
certainly
is
rather
stiff
is
a
cheat
exclaimed
lesbia
angrily
prices
are
positively
exorbitant
dear
child
you
must
not
say
that
seraphine
is
positively
moderate
in
comparison
with
the
new
people
cabochon
too
the
idea
of
his
charging
me
three
hundred
guineas
for
those
stupid
old
amethysts
dear
you
have
diamonds
mixed
with
them
said
lady
kirkbank
reproachfully
lesbia
turned
away
her
head
with
an
impatient
sigh
she
remembered
perfectly
that
it
was
lady
kirkbank
who
had
persuaded
her
to
order
the
diamond
setting
but
there
was
no
use
in
talking
about
it
now
the
thing
was
done
she
was
two
thousand
pounds
in
debt
two
thousand
pounds
to
these
two
people
only
and
there
were
ever
so
many
shops
at
which
she
had
accounts
glovers
bootmakers
the
tailor
who
made
her
newmarket
coats
and
cloth
gowns
the
stationer
who
supplied
her
with
of
every
variety
monogrammed
floral
sporting
illuminated
with
this
or
that
device
the
follies
of
the
passing
hour
hatched
by
penniless
invention
in
a
garret
pandering
to
the
vanities
of
the
idle
must
write
to
my
grandmother
by
this
afternoon
post
said
lesbia
with
a
heavy
sigh
we
have
to
be
at
the
ranelagh
by
four
smithson
and
some
other
men
are
to
meet
us
there
i
have
promised
to
drive
mostyn
down
you
had
better
begin
to
dress
i
ought
to
write
i
had
better
ask
for
this
money
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
two
thousand
pounds
i
feel
as
if
i
were
a
thief
you
say
my
grandmother
is
not
a
rich
woman
rich
as
the
world
goes
nowadays
nobody
is
rich
now
except
your
commercial
magnates
like
smithson
great
peers
unless
their
money
is
in
london
are
great
paupers
to
own
land
is
to
be
destitute
i
do
suppose
two
thousand
pounds
will
break
your
grandmother
bank
but
of
course
it
is
a
large
sum
to
ask
for
at
the
end
of
two
months
especially
as
she
sent
you
a
good
deal
of
money
while
we
were
at
cannes
if
you
were
engaged
about
to
make
a
really
good
match
you
could
ask
for
the
money
as
a
matter
of
course
but
as
it
is
although
you
have
been
tremendously
admired
from
a
practical
point
of
view
you
are
a
failure
a
failure
it
was
a
hard
word
but
lesbia
felt
it
was
true
she
the
reigning
beauty
the
cynosure
of
every
eye
had
made
no
conquest
worth
talking
about
except
smithson
tell
your
grandmother
anything
about
the
bills
for
a
week
or
two
said
lady
kirkbank
soothingly
creatures
can
wait
for
their
money
give
yourself
time
to
think
will
answered
lesbia
dolefully
now
make
haste
and
get
ready
for
the
ranelagh
my
love
your
eyes
are
dreadfully
heavy
you
use
a
little
belladonna
i
send
rilboche
to
you
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
lesbia
too
depressed
to
argue
the
point
consented
to
have
her
eyes
doctored
by
rilboche
she
was
gay
enough
at
the
ranelagh
and
looked
her
loveliest
at
a
dinner
party
that
evening
and
went
to
three
parties
after
the
dinner
and
went
home
in
the
faint
light
of
early
morning
after
sitting
out
a
late
waltz
in
a
balcony
with
smithson
a
balcony
banked
round
with
flowers
which
were
beginning
to
droop
a
little
in
the
chilly
morning
air
just
as
beauty
drooped
under
the
searching
eye
of
day
lesbia
put
the
bills
in
her
desk
and
gave
herself
time
to
think
as
lady
kirkbank
advised
her
but
the
thinking
progress
resulted
in
very
little
good
all
the
thought
of
which
she
was
capable
would
not
reduce
the
totals
of
those
two
dreadful
accounts
and
every
day
brought
some
fresh
bill
the
stationer
the
bootmaker
the
glover
the
perfumer
people
who
had
courted
lady
lesbia
custom
with
an
air
which
implied
that
the
honour
of
serving
fashionable
beauty
was
the
first
consideration
and
the
question
of
payment
quite
a
minor
point
these
now
began
to
ask
for
their
money
in
the
most
prosaic
way
every
straw
added
to
lesbia
burden
and
her
heart
grew
heavier
with
every
post
can
see
the
season
is
waning
when
these
people
begin
to
pester
with
their
accounts
said
lady
kirkbank
who
always
talked
of
tradesmen
as
if
they
were
her
natural
enemies
lesbia
accepted
this
explanation
of
the
avalanche
of
bills
and
never
suspected
lady
kirkbank
influence
in
the
matter
it
happened
however
that
the
chaperon
having
her
own
reasons
for
wishing
to
bring
smithson
suit
to
a
successful
issue
had
told
seraphine
and
the
other
people
to
send
in
their
bills
immediately
lady
lesbia
would
be
leaving
london
in
a
week
or
so
she
informed
these
purveyors
and
would
like
to
settle
everything
before
she
went
away
smithson
appeared
in
arlington
street
almost
every
day
and
was
full
of
schemes
for
new
pleasures
or
pleasures
as
nearly
new
as
the
world
of
fashion
can
afford
he
was
particularly
desirous
that
sir
george
and
lady
kirkbank
with
lady
lesbia
should
stay
at
his
berkshire
place
during
the
henley
week
he
had
a
large
steam
launch
and
the
regatta
was
a
kind
of
carnival
for
his
intimate
friends
who
were
not
too
proud
to
riot
and
batten
upon
the
parvenu
luxurious
hospitality
albeit
they
were
apt
to
talk
somewhat
slightingly
of
his
antecedents
lady
kirkbank
felt
that
this
invitation
was
a
turning
point
and
that
if
lesbia
went
to
stay
at
rood
hall
her
acceptance
of
smithson
was
a
certainty
she
would
see
him
at
his
place
in
berkshire
in
the
most
flattering
aspect
his
surroundings
as
lord
of
the
manor
and
owner
of
one
of
the
finest
old
places
in
the
county
would
lend
dignity
to
his
insignificance
lesbia
at
first
expressed
a
strong
disinclination
to
go
to
rood
hall
there
would
be
a
most
unpleasant
feeling
in
stopping
at
the
house
of
a
man
whom
she
had
refused
she
told
lady
kirkbank
dear
smithson
has
forgiven
you
answered
her
chaperon
is
the
soul
of
good
nature
would
think
he
was
accustomed
to
be
refused
said
lesbia
want
to
go
to
rood
hall
but
i
do
want
to
spoil
your
henley
week
could
not
i
run
down
to
grasmere
for
a
week
with
kibble
to
take
care
of
me
and
see
dear
grandmother
i
could
tell
her
about
those
dreadful
bills
yourself
at
grasmere
in
the
height
of
the
season
not
to
be
thought
of
besides
lady
maulevrier
objected
before
to
the
idea
of
your
travelling
alone
with
kibble
no
if
you
ca
make
up
your
mind
to
go
to
rood
hall
george
and
i
must
make
up
our
minds
to
stay
away
but
it
will
be
rather
hard
lines
for
that
henley
week
is
quite
the
jolliest
thing
in
the
summer
i
go
said
lesbia
with
a
resigned
air
for
worlds
would
i
deprive
you
and
sir
george
of
a
pleasure
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
rather
wished
to
see
rood
hall
she
was
curious
to
behold
the
extent
and
magnitude
of
possessions
she
had
seen
his
italian
villa
in
park
lane
the
perfection
of
modern
art
modern
skill
modern
taste
reviving
the
old
eternally
beautiful
forms
recreating
the
pitti
palace
the
homes
of
the
medici
the
halls
of
dead
and
gone
doges
and
now
she
was
told
that
rood
hall
a
genuine
old
english
in
perfect
preservation
was
even
more
interesting
than
the
villa
in
park
lane
at
rood
hall
there
were
ideal
stables
and
farm
without
number
rose
gardens
lawns
the
river
and
a
deer
park
so
the
invitation
was
accepted
and
smithson
immediately
laid
himself
at
lesbia
feet
as
it
were
with
regard
to
all
other
invitations
for
the
henley
festival
whom
should
he
ask
to
meet
her
whom
would
she
have
are
very
good
she
said
i
have
really
no
wish
to
be
consulted
i
am
not
a
royal
personage
remember
i
could
not
presume
to
dictate
i
wish
you
to
dictate
i
wish
you
to
be
imperious
in
the
expression
of
your
wishes
kirkbank
has
a
better
right
than
i
if
anybody
is
to
be
consulted
said
lesbia
modestly
kirkbank
is
an
old
dear
who
gets
on
delightfully
with
everybody
but
you
are
more
sensitive
your
comfort
might
be
marred
by
an
obnoxious
presence
i
will
ask
nobody
whom
you
do
not
like
who
is
not
thoroughly
have
you
no
particular
friends
of
your
own
choosing
whom
you
would
like
me
to
ask
lesbia
confessed
that
she
had
no
such
friends
she
liked
everybody
tolerably
but
she
had
not
a
talent
for
friendship
perhaps
it
was
because
in
the
london
season
one
was
too
busy
to
make
friends
can
fancy
two
girls
getting
quite
attached
to
each
other
out
of
the
season
she
said
in
may
and
june
life
is
all
a
rush
and
a
scramble
one
has
no
time
to
gather
wayside
flowers
of
friendship
interjected
smithson
if
there
are
no
people
for
whom
you
have
an
especial
liking
there
be
people
whom
you
detest
lesbia
owned
that
it
was
so
detestation
came
of
itself
naturally
let
me
be
sure
i
do
not
ask
any
of
your
pet
aversions
said
smithson
met
plantagenet
parsons
the
theatrical
critic
at
my
house
shall
we
have
him
like
all
amusing
people
horace
meander
the
poet
shall
we
have
him
he
is
brimful
of
conceits
and
affectations
but
he
a
tremendous
joke
meander
is
charming
we
ask
mostyn
and
his
wife
her
scraps
of
science
are
rather
good
fun
have
the
faintest
objection
to
the
mostyns
replied
lesbia
who
are
we
are
you
and
i
for
the
nonce
the
invitations
will
be
issued
ostensibly
by
me
but
they
will
really
emanate
from
you
am
to
be
the
shadow
behind
the
throne
said
lesbia
delightful
would
rather
you
were
the
sovereign
ruler
on
the
throne
answered
smithson
tenderly
throne
shall
be
empty
till
you
fill
it
go
on
with
your
list
of
people
said
lesbia
checking
this
gush
of
sentiment
she
began
to
feel
somehow
that
she
was
drifting
from
all
her
moorings
that
in
accepting
this
invitation
to
rood
hall
she
was
allowing
herself
to
be
ensnared
into
an
alliance
about
which
she
was
still
doubtful
if
anything
better
had
appeared
in
the
prospect
of
her
life
if
any
worthier
suitor
had
come
forward
she
would
have
whistled
smithson
down
the
wind
but
no
worthier
suitor
had
offered
himself
it
was
smithson
or
nothing
if
she
did
not
accept
smithson
she
would
go
back
to
fellside
heavily
burdened
with
debt
and
an
obvious
failure
she
would
have
run
the
gauntlet
of
a
london
season
without
definite
result
and
this
to
a
young
woman
so
impressed
with
her
own
transcendent
merits
was
a
most
humiliating
state
of
things
other
people
names
were
suggested
by
smithson
and
approved
by
lesbia
and
a
house
party
of
about
fourteen
in
all
was
made
up
smithson
steam
launch
would
comfortably
accommodate
that
number
he
had
a
couple
of
barges
for
chance
visitors
and
kept
an
open
table
on
board
them
during
the
regatta
the
visit
arranged
the
next
question
was
gowns
lesbia
had
gowns
enough
to
have
stocked
a
draper
shop
but
then
as
she
and
lady
kirkbank
deplored
the
difficulty
was
that
she
had
worn
them
all
some
as
many
as
three
or
four
times
they
were
doubtless
all
marked
and
known
some
of
them
had
been
described
in
the
society
papers
at
henley
she
would
be
expected
to
wear
something
distinctly
new
to
introduce
some
new
fashion
of
gown
or
hat
or
parasol
no
matter
how
ugly
the
new
thing
might
be
so
long
as
it
was
startling
no
matter
how
eccentric
provided
it
was
original
am
i
to
do
asked
lesbia
despairingly
is
only
one
thing
that
can
be
done
we
must
go
instantly
to
seraphine
and
insist
upon
her
inventing
something
if
she
has
no
idea
ready
she
must
telegraph
worth
and
get
him
to
send
something
over
your
old
things
will
do
very
well
for
rood
hall
you
have
no
end
of
pretty
gowns
for
morning
and
evening
but
you
must
be
original
on
the
race
days
your
gowns
will
be
in
all
the
papers
i
shall
be
only
getting
deeper
into
debt
said
lesbia
with
a
sigh
ca
be
helped
if
you
go
into
society
you
must
be
properly
dressed
we
go
to
clanricarde
place
directly
after
luncheon
and
see
what
that
old
harpy
has
to
show
us
lesbia
had
a
rather
uncomfortable
feeling
about
facing
the
fair
seraphine
without
being
able
to
give
her
a
cheque
upon
account
of
that
dreadful
bill
she
had
quite
accepted
lady
kirkbank
idea
that
bills
never
need
be
discharged
in
full
and
that
the
true
system
of
finance
was
to
give
an
occasional
cheque
on
account
as
a
sop
to
cerberus
true
that
while
cerberus
fattened
on
the
sops
the
bill
seemed
always
growing
and
the
final
crash
when
cerberus
grew
savage
and
sops
could
be
no
more
accepted
was
too
awful
to
be
thought
about
lesbia
entered
seraphine
with
a
faint
expectation
of
unpleasantness
but
after
a
little
whispering
between
lady
kirkbank
and
the
dressmaker
the
latter
came
to
lesbia
smiling
graciously
and
seemingly
full
of
eagerness
for
new
orders
says
you
want
something
of
the
most
original
soit
peu
for
she
said
us
see
now
and
she
tapped
her
forehead
with
a
gold
thimble
which
nobody
had
ever
seen
her
use
but
which
looked
respectable
is
ze
dresses
that
chaumont
wear
in
zis
new
play
faute
dans
le
yes
zere
is
the
watare
dress
a
boating
party
at
bougival
a
toilet
of
the
most
new
striking
what
you
english
call
a
screamer
a
genius
you
are
fifine
exclaimed
lady
kirkbank
rapturously
dans
le
was
only
produced
last
week
no
one
will
have
thought
of
copying
chaumont
gowns
yet
awhile
the
idea
is
an
inspiration
is
the
boating
costume
like
asked
lady
lesbia
faintly
exquisite
combination
of
simplicity
with
answered
the
dressmaker
indigo
silk
jersey
bodice
closely
studded
with
dark
blue
beads
a
flounced
petticoat
of
indigo
and
amber
foulard
an
amber
scarf
drawn
tightly
round
the
hips
and
a
dark
blue
toque
with
a
large
bunch
of
amber
poppies
mousquetaire
gloves
and
hessian
boots
of
kid
boots
ejaculated
lesbia
yes
miladi
the
petticoat
is
somewhat
short
you
comprehend
to
escape
the
damp
of
the
deck
and
after
all
hessians
are
much
less
indelicate
than
silk
stockings
legs
as
one
may
say
you
will
look
enchanting
in
yellow
hessians
said
lady
kirkbank
the
dress
be
put
in
hand
instantly
seraphine
lesbia
was
inclined
to
remonstrate
she
did
not
admire
the
description
of
the
costume
she
would
rather
have
something
less
outrageous
it
is
only
original
exclaimed
her
chaperon
chaumont
wears
it
you
may
be
sure
it
is
perfect
on
the
stage
by
gaslight
in
the
midst
of
unrealities
argued
lesbia
makes
such
a
difference
dear
there
is
no
difference
nowadays
between
the
stage
and
the
whatever
chaumont
wears
you
may
wear
and
now
let
us
think
of
the
second
day
i
think
as
your
first
costume
is
to
be
nautical
and
rather
masculine
your
second
should
be
somewhat
languishing
and
creamy
indian
muslin
wild
flowers
a
large
leghorn
hat
what
will
miladi
herself
wear
asked
the
french
woman
of
lady
kirkbank
must
have
something
of
new
at
my
age
it
does
matter
i
shall
wear
one
of
my
cotton
frocks
and
my
dunstable
hat
lesbia
shuddered
for
lady
kirkbank
in
her
cotton
frock
was
a
spectacle
at
which
youth
laughed
and
age
blushed
but
after
all
it
did
not
matter
to
lesbia
she
would
have
liked
a
less
rowdy
chaperon
but
as
a
foil
to
her
own
fresh
young
beauty
lady
kirkbank
was
admirable
they
drove
down
to
rood
hall
early
next
week
sir
george
conveying
them
in
his
drag
with
a
change
of
horses
at
maidenhead
the
weather
was
peerless
the
country
exquisite
approached
from
london
how
different
that
river
landscape
looks
to
the
eyes
of
the
traveller
returning
from
the
wild
west
of
england
the
wooded
gorges
of
cornwall
and
devon
the
tamar
and
the
dart
then
how
small
and
poor
and
mean
seems
silvery
thames
gliding
peacefully
between
his
willowy
bank
singing
his
lullaby
to
the
whispering
sedges
a
poor
little
river
a
flat
commonplace
landscape
says
the
traveller
fresh
from
moorland
and
tor
from
the
rocky
shore
of
the
atlantic
the
deep
clefts
of
the
great
red
hills
to
lesbia
eyes
the
placid
stream
and
the
green
pastures
breathing
odours
of
and
clover
seemed
passing
lovely
she
was
pleased
with
her
own
hat
and
parasol
too
which
made
her
graciously
disposed
towards
the
landscape
and
the
last
packet
of
gloves
from
north
audley
street
fitted
without
a
wrinkle
the
glovemaker
was
beginning
to
understand
her
hand
which
was
a
study
for
a
sculptor
but
which
had
its
little
peculiarities
nor
was
she
to
smithson
who
had
come
up
to
town
by
an
early
train
in
order
to
lunch
in
arlington
street
and
go
back
by
coach
seated
just
behind
lady
lesbia
who
had
the
box
seat
beside
sir
george
the
drive
was
delightful
it
was
a
few
minutes
after
five
when
the
coach
drove
past
the
picturesque
old
into
smithson
park
and
rood
hall
lay
on
the
low
ground
in
front
of
them
with
its
back
to
the
river
it
was
an
old
red
brick
house
in
the
tudor
style
with
an
advanced
porch
and
four
projecting
wings
three
stories
high
with
picturesque
spire
roofs
overtopping
the
main
building
around
the
house
ran
a
stone
parapet
bearing
the
herons
and
bulrushes
which
were
the
cognisance
of
the
noble
race
for
which
the
mansion
was
built
numerous
projecting
mullioned
windows
broke
up
the
line
of
the
park
front
lesbia
was
fain
to
own
that
rood
hall
was
even
better
than
park
lane
in
london
smithson
had
created
a
palace
but
it
was
a
new
palace
which
still
had
a
faint
flavour
of
bricks
and
mortar
and
which
was
apt
to
remind
the
spectator
of
that
wonderful
erection
of
aladdin
the
famous
parvenu
of
eastern
story
here
in
berkshire
smithson
had
dropped
into
a
nest
which
had
been
kept
warm
for
him
for
three
centuries
aired
and
beautified
by
generations
of
a
noble
race
which
had
obligingly
decayed
and
dwindled
in
order
to
make
room
for
smithson
here
the
parvenu
had
bought
a
home
mellowed
by
the
slow
growth
of
years
touched
into
poetic
beauty
by
the
chastening
fingers
of
time
his
artist
friends
told
him
that
every
brick
in
the
red
walls
was
a
mystery
of
colour
which
only
a
painter
could
fitly
understand
and
value
here
he
had
bought
associations
he
had
bought
history
he
had
bought
the
dust
of
elizabeth
senators
the
bones
of
her
court
beauties
the
coffins
in
the
mausoleum
yonder
in
the
ferny
depths
of
the
park
the
village
church
just
outside
the
gates
these
had
all
gone
with
the
property
lesbia
went
up
the
grand
staircase
through
the
long
corridors
in
a
dream
of
wonder
brought
up
at
fellside
in
that
new
part
of
the
westmoreland
house
which
had
been
built
by
her
grandmother
and
had
no
history
she
felt
thrilled
by
the
sober
splendour
of
this
fine
old
manorial
mansion
all
was
sound
and
substantial
as
if
created
yesterday
so
well
preserved
had
been
the
goods
and
chattels
of
the
noble
race
and
yet
all
wore
such
unmistakeable
marks
of
age
the
deep
rich
colouring
of
the
wainscot
the
faded
hues
of
the
tapestry
the
draperies
of
costliest
velvet
and
brocade
were
all
sobered
by
the
passing
of
years
smithson
had
shown
his
good
taste
in
having
kept
all
things
as
sir
hubert
heronville
the
last
of
his
race
had
left
them
and
the
heronvilles
had
been
one
of
those
grand
old
tory
races
which
change
nothing
of
the
past
lady
lesbia
bedroom
was
the
state
chamber
which
had
been
occupied
by
kings
and
queens
in
days
of
yore
that
grandiose
with
the
carved
ebony
columns
cut
velvet
curtains
and
plumes
of
ostrich
feathers
had
been
built
for
elizabeth
when
she
deigned
to
include
rood
hall
in
one
of
her
royal
progresses
charles
the
first
had
rested
his
weary
head
upon
those
very
pillows
before
he
went
on
to
the
inn
at
uxbridge
where
he
was
to
be
lodged
less
luxuriously
james
the
second
had
stayed
there
when
duke
of
york
with
mistress
anne
hyde
before
he
acknowledged
his
marriage
to
the
multitude
and
anne
daughter
had
occupied
the
same
room
as
queen
of
england
forty
years
later
and
now
the
royal
chamber
with
adjacent
and
oratory
and
spacious
boudoir
all
in
the
same
suite
was
reserved
for
lady
lesbia
haselden
afraid
you
are
spoiling
me
she
told
smithson
when
he
asked
if
she
approved
of
the
rooms
that
had
been
allotted
to
her
feel
quite
ashamed
of
myself
among
the
ghosts
of
dead
and
gone
queens
so
surely
the
royalty
of
beauty
has
as
divine
a
right
as
that
of
an
anointed
sovereign
hope
the
royal
personages
do
walk
exclaimed
lady
kirkbank
in
her
girlish
tone
is
just
the
house
in
which
one
would
expect
ghosts
whereupon
mostyn
hastened
to
enlighten
the
company
upon
the
real
causes
of
which
she
had
lately
studied
in
physiology
and
favoured
them
with
a
diluted
version
of
the
views
of
that
authority
this
was
at
afternoon
tea
in
the
library
where
the
bookcases
filled
with
mighty
folios
and
handsome
octavos
in
old
bindings
looked
as
if
they
had
not
been
opened
for
a
century
the
literature
of
past
ages
furnished
the
room
and
made
a
delightful
background
the
literature
of
the
present
lay
about
on
the
tables
and
testified
that
the
highest
intellectual
flight
of
the
inhabitants
of
rood
hall
was
a
dip
into
the
or
the
or
the
perusal
of
the
last
new
scandal
in
the
shape
of
reminiscences
or
autobiography
one
large
round
table
was
consecrated
to
mudie
another
to
rolandi
on
the
one
side
you
had
oliphant
on
the
other
zola
exemplifying
the
genius
of
the
two
nations
after
tea
smithson
visitors
most
of
whom
had
arrived
in
sir
george
drag
explored
the
grounds
these
were
lovely
beyond
expression
in
the
low
afternoon
light
cedars
of
lebanon
spread
their
broad
shadows
on
the
velvet
lawn
yews
and
wellingtonias
of
mighty
growth
made
an
atmosphere
of
gloom
in
some
parts
of
the
grounds
one
great
feature
was
the
ladies
garden
a
spot
apart
a
great
square
garden
surrounded
with
a
laurel
wall
eight
feet
high
containing
a
rose
garden
where
the
choicest
specimens
grew
and
flourished
while
in
the
centre
there
was
a
circular
with
a
fountain
there
was
a
lavender
walk
too
another
feature
of
the
grounds
at
rood
hall
an
avenue
of
tall
lavender
bushes
much
affected
by
the
stately
dames
of
old
modern
manners
preferred
the
river
terrace
as
a
pleasant
place
on
which
to
loiter
after
dinner
to
watch
the
boats
flashing
by
in
the
evening
light
or
the
sun
going
down
behind
a
fringe
of
willows
on
the
opposite
bank
this
italian
terrace
with
its
statues
and
carved
vases
filled
with
roses
fuchsias
and
geraniums
was
the
great
point
of
rendezvous
at
rood
hall
an
ideal
spot
whereon
to
linger
in
the
deepening
twilight
from
which
to
gaze
upon
the
moonlit
river
later
on
in
the
night
the
windows
of
the
and
and
ballroom
opened
on
to
this
terrace
and
the
royal
wing
the
wing
now
devoted
to
lady
lesbia
looked
upon
the
terrace
and
the
river
as
your
house
is
altogether
i
think
this
river
view
is
the
best
part
of
it
said
lady
lesbia
as
she
strolled
with
smithson
on
the
terrace
after
dinner
dressed
in
indian
muslin
which
was
almost
as
poetical
as
a
vapour
and
with
a
cloud
of
delicate
lace
wrapped
round
her
head
think
i
shall
spend
half
of
my
life
at
my
boudoir
window
gloating
over
that
delicious
landscape
horace
meander
the
poet
was
discoursing
to
a
select
group
upon
that
peculiar
quality
of
willows
which
causes
them
to
shiver
and
quiver
and
throw
little
lights
and
shadows
on
the
river
and
on
the
subtle
ineffable
beauty
of
twilight
which
perhaps
however
utterly
beautiful
in
the
abstract
would
have
been
more
agreeable
to
him
personally
if
he
had
not
been
surrounded
by
a
cloud
of
gnats
which
refused
to
be
buffeted
off
his
head
while
meander
poetised
in
his
usual
eloquent
style
mostyn
as
a
still
newer
light
discoursed
as
eloquently
to
little
a
knot
of
women
imparting
valuable
information
upon
the
anatomical
structure
and
individual
peculiarities
of
those
various
insects
which
are
the
pests
of
a
summer
evening
do
like
gnats
exclaimed
the
lady
very
extraordinary
do
you
know
i
have
spent
days
and
weeks
upon
the
study
of
their
habits
and
dear
little
ways
they
are
the
most
interesting
creatures
far
superior
to
in
intellect
do
you
know
that
they
fight
and
that
they
have
tribes
which
are
enemies
like
those
dreadful
corsicans
and
that
they
make
little
sepulchres
in
the
bark
of
trees
and
bury
each
other
alive
if
they
can
and
they
hold
vestries
and
have
burial
boards
they
are
most
absorbing
creatures
if
you
only
give
yourself
up
to
the
study
of
them
but
it
is
no
use
to
be
in
a
study
of
that
kind
i
went
without
so
much
as
a
cup
of
tea
for
hours
watching
my
gnats
for
fear
the
opening
of
the
door
should
startle
them
another
time
i
shall
make
the
nursery
governess
watch
for
me
interesting
how
noble
of
you
exclaimed
the
other
ladies
and
then
they
began
to
talk
about
bonnets
and
about
smithson
to
speculate
how
much
money
this
house
and
all
his
other
houses
had
cost
him
and
to
wonder
if
he
was
really
rich
or
if
he
were
only
one
of
those
great
financial
windbags
which
so
often
explode
and
leave
the
world
aghast
marvelling
at
the
ease
with
which
it
has
been
deluded
they
wondered
too
whether
lady
lesbia
haselden
meant
to
marry
him
course
she
does
my
dear
answered
mostyn
decisively
do
suppose
that
after
having
studied
the
habits
of
i
can
not
read
such
a
poor
shallow
creature
as
a
silly
vain
girl
of
course
lady
lesbia
means
to
marry
smithson
fine
houses
and
she
is
only
amusing
herself
and
swelling
her
own
importance
by
letting
him
dangle
in
a
kind
of
suspense
which
is
not
suspense
for
he
knows
as
well
as
she
does
that
she
means
to
have
him
the
next
day
was
given
up
first
to
seeing
the
house
an
amusement
which
lasted
very
well
for
an
hour
or
so
after
breakfast
and
then
to
wandering
in
a
desultory
manner
to
rowing
and
canoeing
and
a
little
sailing
and
a
good
deal
of
screaming
and
pretty
timidity
upon
the
blue
bright
river
to
gathering
wild
flowers
and
ferns
in
rustic
lanes
and
to
an
luncheon
in
the
wood
at
medmenham
and
then
dinner
and
then
music
an
evening
spent
half
within
and
half
without
the
cigarettes
sparkling
like
glowworms
on
the
terrace
tall
talk
from
meander
long
quotations
from
his
own
muse
and
that
of
rossetti
a
little
shelley
a
little
keats
a
good
deal
of
swinburne
the
festivities
were
late
on
this
second
evening
as
smithson
had
invited
a
good
many
people
from
the
neighbourhood
but
the
house
party
were
not
the
less
early
on
the
following
morning
which
was
the
first
henley
day
it
was
a
peerless
morning
and
all
the
brasswork
of
launch
sparkled
and
shone
in
the
sun
as
she
lay
in
front
of
the
terrace
a
wooden
pier
a
portable
construction
was
thrown
out
from
the
terrace
steps
to
enable
the
company
to
go
on
board
the
launch
without
the
possibility
of
wet
feet
or
damaged
raiment
lesbia
chaumount
costume
was
a
success
the
women
praised
it
the
men
stared
and
admired
the
silken
jersey
sparkling
with
closely
studded
indigo
beads
fitted
the
slim
graceful
figure
as
a
scales
fit
the
serpent
the
coquettish
little
blue
silk
toque
the
careless
cluster
of
poppies
against
the
glossy
brown
hair
the
large
sunshade
of
old
gold
satin
lined
with
indigo
the
flounced
petticoat
of
softest
indian
silk
the
dainty
little
boots
with
high
heels
and
pointed
toes
were
all
perfect
after
their
fashion
and
smithson
felt
that
the
liege
lady
of
his
life
the
woman
he
meant
to
marry
willy
nilly
would
be
the
belle
of
the
nor
was
he
disappointed
everybody
in
london
had
heard
of
lady
lesbia
haselden
her
photograph
was
in
all
the
windows
was
enshrined
in
the
albums
of
south
kensington
and
clapham
maida
vale
and
haverstock
hill
people
whose
circles
were
far
remote
from
lady
lesbia
circle
were
as
familiar
with
her
beauty
as
if
they
had
known
her
from
her
cradle
and
all
these
outsiders
wanted
to
see
her
in
the
flesh
just
as
they
always
thirst
to
behold
royal
personages
so
when
it
became
known
that
the
beautiful
lady
lesbia
haselden
was
on
board
smithson
launch
all
the
people
in
the
small
boats
or
on
neighbouring
barges
made
it
their
business
to
have
a
good
look
at
her
the
launch
was
almost
mobbed
by
those
inquisitive
little
boats
in
the
intervals
between
the
races
are
the
people
all
staring
and
hustling
one
another
for
asked
lesbia
innocently
she
had
seen
the
same
hustling
and
whispering
and
staring
in
the
hall
at
the
opera
when
she
was
waiting
for
her
carriage
but
she
chose
to
affect
unconsciousness
do
they
all
want
think
they
want
to
see
you
said
smithson
who
was
sitting
by
her
side
very
natural
desire
lesbia
laughed
and
lowered
the
big
yellow
sunshade
so
as
to
hide
herself
altogether
from
the
starers
silly
she
exclaimed
is
all
the
fault
of
those
horrid
photographers
they
vulgarise
everything
and
everybody
i
will
never
be
photographed
again
yes
you
will
and
in
that
frock
it
the
prettiest
thing
i
seen
for
a
long
time
why
do
you
hide
yourself
from
those
poor
wretches
who
keep
rowing
backwards
and
forwards
in
an
obviously
aimless
way
just
to
get
a
peep
at
you
what
happiness
for
us
who
live
near
you
and
can
gaze
when
we
will
without
all
those
absurd
manoeuvres
there
goes
the
signal
and
now
for
a
race
lesbia
pretended
to
be
interested
in
the
racing
she
pretended
to
be
gay
but
her
heart
was
as
heavy
as
lead
the
burden
of
debt
which
had
been
growing
ever
since
seraphine
sent
in
her
bill
was
weighing
her
down
to
the
dust
she
owed
three
thousand
pounds
it
seemed
incredible
that
she
should
owe
so
much
that
a
girl
frivolous
fancies
and
extravagances
could
amount
to
such
a
sum
within
so
short
a
span
but
thoughtless
purchases
ignorant
orders
had
run
on
from
week
to
week
and
the
main
result
was
an
indebtedness
of
close
upon
three
thousand
pounds
three
thousand
pounds
the
sum
was
continually
sounding
in
her
ears
like
the
cry
of
a
screech
owl
the
very
ripple
of
the
river
flowing
so
peacefully
under
the
blue
summer
sky
seemed
to
repeat
the
words
three
thousand
pounds
it
much
she
wondered
having
no
standard
of
comparison
it
very
much
more
than
my
grandmother
will
expect
me
to
have
spent
in
the
time
will
it
trouble
her
to
have
to
pay
those
bills
will
she
be
very
angry
these
were
questions
which
lesbia
kept
asking
herself
in
every
pause
of
her
frivolous
existence
in
such
a
pause
as
this
for
instance
while
the
people
round
her
were
standing
breathless
gazing
after
the
boats
she
did
not
care
a
straw
for
the
boats
who
won
or
who
lost
the
race
it
was
all
a
hollow
mockery
indeed
it
seemed
just
now
that
the
only
real
thing
in
life
was
those
accursed
bills
which
would
have
to
be
paid
somehow
she
had
told
lady
maulevrier
nothing
about
them
as
yet
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
advised
by
lady
kirkbank
and
she
had
taken
time
to
think
but
thought
had
given
her
no
help
the
days
were
gliding
onward
and
lady
maulevrier
would
have
to
be
told
she
meditated
perplexedly
about
her
grandmother
income
she
had
never
heard
the
extent
of
it
but
had
taken
for
granted
that
lady
maulevrier
was
rich
would
three
thousand
pounds
make
a
great
inroad
on
that
income
would
it
be
a
year
income
half
a
year
lesbia
had
no
idea
life
at
fellside
was
carried
on
in
an
elegant
manner
with
considerable
luxury
in
house
and
garden
a
luxury
of
flowers
a
lavish
expenditure
of
labour
yet
the
expenditure
of
lady
maulevrier
existence
spent
always
on
the
same
spot
must
be
as
nothing
to
the
money
spent
in
such
a
life
as
lady
kirkbank
which
involved
the
keeping
up
of
three
or
four
houses
and
costly
journeys
to
and
fro
and
incessant
change
of
attire
no
doubt
lady
maulevrier
had
saved
money
yes
she
must
have
saved
thousands
during
her
long
seclusion
lesbia
argued
her
grandmother
had
told
her
that
she
was
to
look
upon
herself
as
an
heiress
this
could
only
mean
that
lady
maulevrier
had
a
fortune
to
leave
her
and
this
being
so
what
could
it
matter
if
she
had
anticipated
some
of
her
portion
and
yet
there
was
in
her
heart
of
hearts
a
terrible
fear
of
that
stern
dowager
of
the
cold
scorn
in
those
splendid
eyes
when
she
should
stand
revealed
in
all
her
foolishness
her
selfish
mindless
vain
extravagances
she
who
had
never
been
reproved
shrank
with
a
sickly
dread
from
the
idea
of
reproof
and
to
be
told
that
her
career
as
a
fashionable
beauty
had
been
a
failure
that
would
be
the
bitterest
pang
of
all
soon
came
luncheon
and
heidseck
and
then
an
afternoon
which
was
gayer
than
the
morning
had
been
inasmuch
as
every
one
babbled
and
laughed
more
after
luncheon
and
then
there
was
five
tea
on
deck
under
the
striped
japanese
awning
to
the
jingle
of
banjos
enlivened
by
the
wit
of
minstrels
amidst
wherries
and
canoes
and
gondolas
and
ponderous
houseboats
and
snorting
launches
crowding
the
sides
of
the
sunlit
river
in
full
view
of
the
crowd
yonder
in
front
of
the
red
lion
and
here
on
this
nearer
bank
and
all
along
either
shore
fringing
the
green
meadows
with
a
gaudy
border
of
humanity
it
was
a
gay
scene
and
lesbia
gave
herself
up
to
the
amusement
of
the
hour
and
talked
and
chaffed
as
she
had
learned
to
talk
and
chaff
in
one
brief
season
holding
her
own
against
all
comers
rood

looked
lovely
when
they
went
back
to

of

is
it
asked
smithson
seeing
admiring
gaze
as
the
launch
neared
the
terrace
they
two
were
standing
in
the
bows
apart
from
all
the

it

simply

it

thing
wanted

is
that

can

you
he
took
her
hand
which
she
did
not
withdraw
from
his
grasp
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
the
little
hand
in
its
soft
swedish
glove
you
lesbia
he
repeated
earnestly
and
she
answered
softly
that
one
brief
syllable
was
more
like
a
sigh
than
a
spoken
word
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
in
the
utterance
of
that
syllable
the
three
thousand
pounds
had
been
paid
chapter
xxxi
is
my
love
kind
while
lady
lesbia
was
draining
the
cup
of
london
folly
and
london
care
to
the
dregs
lady
mary
was
leading
her
usual
quiet
life
beside
the
glassy
lake
where
the
green
and
sheep
walks
were
reflected
in
all
their
summer
verdure
under
the
cloudless
azure
of
a
summer
sky
a
monotonous
life
passing
dull
as
seen
from
the
outside
and
yet
mary
was
very
happy
happy
even
in
her
solitude
with
the
grave
deep
joy
of
a
satisfied
heart
a
mind
at
rest
all
life
had
taken
a
new
colour
since
her
engagement
to
john
hammond
a
sense
of
new
duties
an
awakening
earnestness
had
given
a
graver
tone
to
her
character
her
spirits
were
less
wild
yet
not
less
joyous
than
of
old
the
joy
was
holier
deeper
her
lover
letters
were
the
chief
delight
of
her
lonely
days
to
read
them
again
and
again
and
ponder
upon
them
and
then
to
pour
out
all
her
heart
and
mind
in
answering
them
these
were
pleasures
enough
for
her
young
life
hammond
letters
were
such
as
any
woman
might
be
proud
to
receive
they
were
not
only
he
wrote
as
friend
to
friend
not
descending
from
the
proud
pinnacle
of
masculine
intelligence
to
the
lower
level
of
feminine
silliness
not
writing
down
to
a
simple
country
girl
capacity
but
writing
fully
and
fervently
as
if
there
were
no
subject
too
lofty
or
too
grave
for
the
understanding
of
his
betrothed
he
wrote
as
one
sure
of
being
sympathised
with
wrote
as
to
his
second
self
and
mary
showed
herself
not
unworthy
of
the
honour
thus
rendered
to
her
intellect
there
was
one
world
which
had
newly
opened
to
mary
since
her
engagement
and
that
was
the
world
of
politics
hammond
had
told
her
that
his
ambition
was
to
succeed
as
a
politician
to
do
some
good
in
his
day
as
one
of
the
governing
body
and
of
late
she
had
made
it
her
business
to
learn
how
england
and
the
world
outside
england
were
governed
she
had
no
natural
leaning
to
the
study
of
political
economy
instead
she
had
always
imagined
any
question
relating
to
the
government
of
her
country
to
be
inherently
and
uninviting
but
had
john
hammond
devoted
his
days
to
the
study
of
coptic
manuscripts
or
the
inscriptions
upon
assyrian
tablets
she
would
have
toiled
her
hardest
in
the
endeavour
to
make
herself
a
coptic
scholar
or
an
adept
in
the
cuneiform
characters
if
he
had
been
a
student
of
chinese
she
would
not
have
been
discomfited
by
such
a
trifle
as
the
fifty
thousand
characters
in
the
chinese
alphabet
and
so
as
he
was
to
make
his
name
in
the
arena
of
public
life
she
set
herself
to
acquire
a
proper
understanding
of
the
science
of
politics
and
to
this
end
she
gorged
herself
with
english
history
hume
hallam
green
justin
mccarthy
palgrave
lecky
from
the
days
of
witenagemote
to
the
reform
bill
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
the
disestablishment
of
the
irish
church
ballot
trade
unionism
and
unreciprocated
free
trade
no
question
was
deep
enough
to
repel
her
for
was
not
her
lover
interested
in
the
dryest
thereof
and
what
concerned
him
and
his
welfare
must
needs
be
full
of
interest
for
her
to
this
end
she
read
the
debates
religiously
day
by
day
and
she
one
day
ventured
shyly
to
suggest
that
she
should
read
them
aloud
to
lady
maulevrier
it
not
be
a
little
rest
for
you
if
i
were
to
read
your
times
aloud
to
you
every
afternoon
grandmother
she
asked
read
so
many
books
french
english
and
german
and
i
think
your
eyes
must
get
a
little
tired
sometimes
mary
ventured
the
remark
with
some
timidity
for
those
falcon
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
all
the
time
bright
and
clear
and
steady
as
the
eyes
of
youth
it
seemed
almost
an
impertinence
to
suggest
that
such
eyes
could
know
weariness
mary
my
sight
holds
out
wonderfully
for
an
old
woman
replied
her
ladyship
gently
new
theory
of
the
last
oculist
whose
book
i
dipped
into
a
very
amusing
and
interesting
book
is
that
the
sight
improves
and
strengthens
by
constant
use
and
that
an
agricultural
labourer
who
hardly
uses
his
eyes
at
all
has
rarely
in
the
decline
of
life
so
good
a
sight
as
the
watchmaker
or
the
student
i
have
read
immensely
all
my
life
and
find
myself
no
worse
for
that
indulgence
but
you
may
read
the
debates
to
me
if
you
like
my
dear
for
if
my
eyes
are
strong
i
myself
am
very
tired
sick
to
death
mary
sick
to
death
the
splendid
eyes
turned
from
mary
and
looked
away
to
the
blue
sky
to
the
hills
in
their
ineffable
beauty
of
colour
and
light
shifting
changing
with
every
moment
of
the
summer
day
intense
weariness
a
settled
despair
were
expressed
in
that
look
tearless
yet
sadder
than
all
tears
must
be
very
monotonous
very
sad
for
you
murmured
mary
her
own
eyes
brimming
over
with
tears
it
will
not
be
always
so
dear
grandmother
i
hope
a
time
will
come
when
you
will
be
able
to
go
about
again
to
resume
your
old
life
do
not
hope
mary
no
child
i
feel
and
know
that
time
will
never
come
my
strength
is
ebbing
slowly
day
by
day
if
i
live
for
another
year
live
to
see
lesbia
married
and
you
too
perhaps
well
i
shall
die
at
peace
at
peace
no
not
she
faltered
and
the
thin
hand
was
pressed
upon
her
brow
will
be
said
of
me
when
i
am
dead
mary
feared
that
her
grandmother
mind
was
wandering
she
came
and
knelt
beside
the
couch
laid
and
her
head
against
the
satin
pillows
tenderly
caressingly
grandmother
pray
be
calm
she
murmured
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
as
if
you
would
read
my
heart
there
are
hearts
that
must
not
be
looked
into
mine
is
like
a
monotonous
yes
my
life
has
been
monotonous
no
conventual
gloom
was
ever
deeper
than
the
gloom
of
fellside
my
boy
did
nothing
to
lighten
it
for
me
and
his
son
followed
in
his
father
footsteps
you
and
lesbia
have
been
my
only
consolation
lesbia
i
was
so
proud
of
her
beauty
so
proud
and
fond
of
her
because
she
was
like
me
and
recalled
my
own
youth
and
see
how
easily
she
forgets
me
she
has
gone
into
a
new
world
in
which
my
age
and
my
infirmities
have
no
part
and
i
am
as
nothing
to
her
mary
changed
from
red
to
pale
so
painful
was
her
embarrassment
what
could
she
say
in
defence
of
her
sister
how
could
she
deny
that
lesbia
was
an
ingrate
when
those
rare
and
hurried
letters
so
careless
in
their
tone
expressing
the
selfishness
of
the
writer
in
every
syllable
told
but
too
plainly
of
forgetfulness
and
ingratitude
grandmother
lesbia
has
so
much
to
do
her
life
is
so
full
of
engagements
she
faltered
feebly
she
goes
from
party
to
party
she
gives
herself
up
heart
and
mind
and
soul
to
pleasures
which
she
ought
to
consider
only
as
the
trivial
means
to
great
ends
and
she
forgets
the
woman
who
reared
her
and
cared
for
her
and
watched
over
her
from
her
infancy
and
who
tried
to
inspire
her
with
a
noble
yes
read
to
me
child
read
give
me
new
thoughts
if
you
can
for
my
brain
is
weary
with
grinding
the
old
ones
there
was
a
grand
debate
in
the
lords
last
night
and
lord
hartfield
spoke
let
me
hear
his
speech
you
can
read
what
was
said
by
the
man
before
him
never
mind
the
rest
mary
read
lord
somebody
speech
which
was
passing
dull
but
which
prepared
the
ground
for
a
magnificent
and
exhaustive
reply
from
lord
hartfield
the
question
was
an
important
one
affecting
the
of
the
masses
and
lord
hartfield
spoke
with
an
eloquence
which
rose
in
force
and
fire
as
he
wound
himself
like
a
serpent
into
the
heart
of
his
subject
beginning
quietly
soberly
with
no
opening
flashes
of
rhetoric
but
rising
gradually
to
the
topmost
heights
of
oratory
a
speech
cried
lady
maulevrier
delighted
her
cheeks
glowing
her
eyes
kindling
a
noble
fellow
the
speaker
must
be
oh
mary
i
must
tell
you
a
secret
i
loved
that
man
father
yes
my
dear
i
loved
him
fondly
dearly
truly
as
you
love
that
young
man
of
yours
and
he
was
the
only
man
i
ever
really
loved
fate
parted
us
but
i
have
never
forgotten
him
never
mary
never
at
this
moment
i
have
but
to
close
my
eyes
and
i
can
see
his
face
see
him
looking
at
me
as
he
looked
the
last
time
we
met
he
was
a
younger
son
poor
his
future
quite
hopeless
in
those
days
but
it
was
not
my
fault
we
were
parted
i
would
have
married
him
yes
wedded
poverty
just
as
you
are
going
to
marry
this
hammond
but
my
people
would
not
let
me
and
i
was
too
young
too
helpless
to
make
a
good
fight
oh
mary
if
i
had
only
fought
hard
enough
what
a
happy
woman
i
might
have
been
and
how
good
a
wife
were
a
good
wife
to
my
grandfather
i
am
sure
faltered
mary
by
way
of
saying
something
consolatory
a
dark
frown
came
over
lady
maulevrier
face
which
had
softened
to
deepest
tenderness
just
before
good
wife
to
maulevrier
she
said
in
a
mocking
tone
well
yes
as
good
a
wife
as
such
a
husband
deserved
was
better
than
wife
mary
for
no
breath
of
suspicion
ever
rested
upon
my
name
but
if
i
had
married
ronald
hollister
i
should
have
been
a
happy
woman
and
that
i
have
never
been
since
i
parted
from
him
have
never
seen
the
present
lord
hartfield
i
think
but
i
have
watched
his
career
i
have
thought
of
him
his
father
died
while
he
was
an
infant
and
he
was
brought
up
in
seclusion
by
a
widowed
mother
who
kept
him
tied
to
her
till
he
went
to
oxford
she
idolised
him
and
i
am
told
she
taught
herself
latin
and
greek
mathematics
even
in
order
to
help
him
in
his
boyish
studies
and
later
on
read
greek
plays
and
latin
poetry
with
him
till
she
became
an
exceptional
classic
for
a
woman
she
was
her
son
companion
and
friend
sympathised
with
his
tastes
his
pleasures
his
friendships
devoted
every
hour
of
her
life
every
thought
of
her
mind
to
his
welfare
his
interests
walked
with
him
rode
with
him
travelled
half
over
europe
yachted
with
him
her
friends
all
declared
that
the
lad
would
grow
up
an
odious
milksop
but
i
am
told
that
there
never
was
a
manlier
man
than
lord
hartfield
from
his
boyhood
he
was
his
protector
helped
to
administer
her
affairs
acquired
a
premature
sense
of
responsibility
and
escaped
almost
all
those
vices
which
make
young
men
detestable
his
mother
died
within
a
few
months
of
his
majority
he
was
at
losing
her
and
left
europe
immediately
after
her
death
from
that
time
he
has
been
a
great
traveller
but
i
suppose
now
that
he
has
taken
his
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
and
has
spoken
a
good
many
times
he
means
to
settle
down
and
take
his
place
among
the
foremost
men
of
his
day
i
am
told
that
he
is
worthy
to
take
such
a
place
must
feel
warmly
interested
in
watching
his
career
said
mary
sympathetically
am
interested
in
everything
that
concerns
him
i
will
tell
you
another
secret
mary
i
think
i
am
getting
into
my
dotage
my
dear
or
i
should
hardly
talk
to
you
like
this
said
lady
maulevrier
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
mary
was
sitting
on
a
stool
by
the
sofa
close
to
the
invalid
pillow
she
clasped
her
grandmother
hand
and
kissed
it
fondly
grandmother
i
think
you
are
talking
to
me
like
this
because
you
are
beginning
to
care
for
me
a
little
she
said
tenderly
my
dear
you
are
very
good
very
sweet
and
forgiving
to
care
for
me
at
all
after
my
neglect
of
you
answered
lady
maulevrier
with
a
sigh
have
kept
you
out
in
the
cold
so
long
mary
lesbia
well
lesbia
has
been
a
kind
of
infatuation
for
me
and
like
all
infatuations
mine
has
ended
in
disappointment
and
bitterness
ambition
has
been
the
bane
of
my
life
mary
and
when
i
could
no
longer
be
ambitious
for
myself
when
my
own
existence
had
become
a
mere
death
in
life
i
began
to
dream
and
to
scheme
for
the
aggrandisement
of
my
granddaughter
lesbia
beauty
lesbia
elegance
seemed
to
make
success
certain
and
so
i
dreamt
my
dream
which
may
never
be
fulfilled
was
your
dream
grandmother
may
i
know
all
about
it
was
the
secret
i
spoke
of
just
now
yes
mary
you
may
know
for
i
fear
the
dream
will
never
be
realised
i
wanted
my
lesbia
to
become
lord
hartfield
wife
i
would
have
brought
them
together
myself
could
i
have
but
gone
to
london
but
failing
that
i
fancied
lady
kirkbank
would
have
divined
my
wishes
without
being
told
them
and
would
have
introduced
hartfield
to
lesbia
and
now
the
london
season
is
drawing
to
a
close
and
hartfield
and
lesbia
have
never
met
he
hardly
goes
anywhere
i
am
told
he
devotes
himself
exclusively
to
politics
and
he
is
not
in
lady
kirkbank
set
a
terrible
disappointment
to
me
mary
is
a
pity
said
mary
is
so
lovely
if
lord
hartfield
were
he
ought
to
fall
in
love
with
her
could
they
but
meet
i
thought
that
in
london
all
fashionable
people
knew
each
other
and
were
continually
meeting
used
to
be
so
in
my
day
mary
almack
was
a
common
ground
even
if
there
had
been
no
other
but
now
there
are
circles
and
circles
i
believe
rings
that
touch
occasionally
but
never
break
and
mingle
i
am
afraid
poor
georgie
set
is
not
quite
so
nice
as
i
could
have
wished
yet
lesbia
writes
as
if
she
were
in
raptures
with
her
chaperon
and
with
all
the
people
she
meets
and
then
georgie
tells
me
that
this
smithson
whom
lesbia
has
refused
is
a
very
important
personage
a
millionaire
and
very
likely
to
be
made
a
peer
new
peer
said
mary
making
a
wry
face
would
rather
have
an
old
commoner
i
always
fancy
a
peer
must
be
like
a
house
glaring
and
staring
and
arid
and
uncongenial
said
lady
maulevrier
would
not
despise
a
chatham
or
a
wellington
because
of
the
newness
of
his
title
but
a
man
who
has
only
money
to
recommend
him
lady
maulevrier
left
her
sentence
unfinished
save
by
a
shrug
while
mary
made
another
wry
face
she
had
that
grand
contempt
for
sordid
wealth
which
is
common
to
young
people
who
have
never
known
the
want
of
money
hope
lesbia
will
marry
some
one
better
than
smithson
she
said
hope
so
too
dear
and
yet
do
you
know
i
have
an
idea
that
lesbia
means
to
accept
smithson
or
she
would
hardly
have
consented
to
go
to
his
house
for
the
henley
week
here
is
a
letter
from
georgie
kirkbank
which
you
will
have
to
answer
for
me
a
letter
full
of
raptures
about
smithson
place
in
berkshire
rood
hall
i
remember
the
house
well
i
was
there
nearly
fifty
years
ago
when
the
heronvilles
owned
it
and
now
the
heronvilles
are
all
dead
or
ruined
and
this
city
person
is
master
of
the
fine
old
mansion
it
is
a
strange
world
mary
from
that
time
forward
mary
and
her
grandmother
were
on
more
confidential
terms
and
when
two
days
later
fellside
was
startled
into
life
by
the
unexpected
arrival
of
lord
maulevrier
and
hammond
the
dowager
seemed
almost
as
pleased
as
her
granddaughter
at
the
arrival
of
the
young
men
as
for
mary
she
was
almost
beside
herself
with
joy
when
she
heard
their
voices
from
the
lawn
and
rushing
to
the
shrubbery
saw
them
walk
up
the
hill
as
she
had
seen
them
on
that
first
evening
nearly
a
year
ago
when
john
hammond
came
as
a
stranger
to
fellside
she
tried
to
take
her
joy
soberly
though
her
eyes
were
dancing
with
delight
as
she
went
to
the
porch
to
meet
them
extraordinary
young
men
you
are
she
said
as
she
emerged
breathless
from
her
lover
embrace
idea
of
your
descending
upon
us
without
a
moment
notice
why
did
you
not
write
or
telegraph
that
your
rooms
might
be
ready
i
to
understand
that
all
the
spare
rooms
at
fellside
are
kept
as
damp
as
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
asked
maulevrier
did
not
think
any
preparation
was
necessary
but
we
can
go
back
if
not
wanted
ca
we
jack
darling
cried
mary
hanging
affectionately
upon
her
arm
i
was
only
joking
you
how
enraptured
i
am
to
have
you
have
only
me
said
maulevrier
does
count
i
suppose
know
how
glad
i
am
and
that
i
want
to
hide
my
gladness
answered
mary
radiant
and
blushing
like
the
rich
red
roses
in
the
porch
men
are
so
vain
and
now
come
and
see
grandmother
she
will
be
cheered
by
your
arrival
she
has
been
so
good
to
me
just
lately
so
sweet
might
have
been
good
and
sweet
to
you
all
your
life
said
hammond
am
not
prepared
to
be
grateful
to
her
at
a
moment
notice
for
any
crumbs
of
affection
she
may
throw
you
but
you
must
be
grateful
sir
and
you
must
love
her
and
pity
her
retorted
mary
how
sadly
she
has
suffered
we
can
not
be
too
kind
to
her
or
too
fond
of
her
poor
dear
is
right
said
hammond
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
wonderful
instincts
these
young
women
have
and
see
her
ladyship
and
then
you
must
have
dinner
just
as
you
had
that
first
evening
said
mary
act
that
first
evening
over
again
jack
only
you
ca
fall
in
love
with
lesbia
as
she
here
do
think
i
surrendered
that
first
evening
mary
though
i
thought
your
sister
the
loveliest
girl
i
had
ever
seen
what
did
you
think
of
me
sir
tell
me
that
said
mary
i
tell
you
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
course
i
freely
confess
that
i
did
not
think
about
you
at
all
you
were
there
a
pretty
innocent
bright
young
maiden
with
big
brown
eyes
and
auburn
hair
but
i
thought
no
more
about
you
than
i
did
about
the
gainsborough
on
the
wall
which
you
very
much
resemble
is
most
humiliating
said
mary
pouting
a
little
in
the
midst
of
her
bliss
dearest
it
is
only
natural
answered
hammond
believe
if
all
the
happy
lovers
in
this
world
could
be
questioned
at
least
half
of
them
would
confess
to
having
thought
very
little
about
each
other
at
first
meeting
they
meet
and
touch
hands
and
part
again
and
never
guess
the
mystery
of
the
future
which
wraps
them
round
like
a
cloud
never
say
of
each
other
there
is
my
fate
and
then
they
meet
again
and
again
as
hazard
wills
and
never
know
that
they
are
drifting
to
their
doom
mary
rang
bells
and
gave
orders
just
as
she
had
done
in
that
summer
gloaming
a
year
ago
the
young
men
had
arrived
just
at
the
same
hour
on
the
stroke
of
nine
when
the
eight
dinner
was
over
and
done
with
for
a
meal
with
fräulein
müller
was
not
a
feast
to
be
prolonged
on
account
of
its
felicity
perhaps
they
had
so
contrived
as
to
arrive
exactly
at
this
hour
lady
maulevrier
received
them
both
with
extreme
cordiality
but
the
young
men
saw
a
change
for
the
worse
in
the
invalid
since
the
spring
the
face
was
thinner
the
eyes
too
bright
the
flush
upon
the
hollow
cheek
had
a
hectic
tinge
the
voice
was
feebler
hammond
was
reminded
of
a
falcon
or
an
eagle
pining
and
wasting
in
a
cage
am
very
glad
to
see
you
hammond
said
lady
maulevrier
giving
him
her
hand
and
addressing
him
with
unwonted
cordiality
was
a
happy
thought
that
brought
you
and
maulevrier
here
when
an
old
woman
is
as
near
the
grave
as
i
am
her
relatives
ought
to
look
after
her
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
little
private
conversation
with
you
hammond
if
you
can
spare
me
a
few
minutes
many
hours
if
your
ladyship
pleases
said
hammond
time
is
entirely
at
your
service
no
you
will
want
to
be
roaming
about
the
hills
with
mary
discussing
your
plans
for
the
future
i
shall
not
encroach
too
much
on
your
time
but
i
am
very
glad
you
are
here
shall
only
trespass
on
you
for
a
few
days
said
maulevrier
a
flying
visit
is
it
that
you
are
not
both
at
henley
asked
mary
thought
all
the
world
was
at
henley
is
henley
what
is
henley
demanded
maulevrier
pretending
ignorance
believe
maulevrier
has
lost
so
much
money
backing
his
college
boat
on
previous
occasions
that
he
is
glad
to
run
away
from
the
regatta
this
year
said
hammond
have
a
sister
there
replied
his
friend
an
explanation
when
a
fellow
take
to
going
to
races
and
regattas
it
is
high
time
for
to
stop
away
you
seen
lesbia
lately
asked
his
grandmother
ten
days
ago
did
she
seem
happy
maulevrier
shrugged
his
shoulders
was
vacillating
between
the
refusal
or
the
acceptance
of
a
million
of
money
and
four
or
five
fine
houses
i
do
know
whether
that
condition
of
mind
means
happiness
i
should
call
it
an
intermediate
state
do
you
make
silly
jokes
about
serious
questions
do
you
think
lesbia
means
to
accept
this
mr
smithson
london
thinks
so
is
he
a
good
man
for
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
at
half
an
hour
notice
he
worthy
of
your
sister
maulevrier
paused
looked
at
his
grandmother
with
a
curious
expression
and
then
replied
think
he
is
quite
i
am
content
that
she
should
marry
him
said
lady
maulevrier
he
is
a
nobody
but
he
is
a
very
important
nobody
a
nobody
who
can
get
a
peerage
next
year
backed
by
the
maulevrier
influence
which
i
suppose
would
count
for
something
of
my
friends
are
dead
said
lady
maulevrier
there
are
a
few
survivors
of
the
past
who
might
help
me
do
think
there
be
any
difficulty
or
doubt
about
the
peerage
smithson
stumped
up
very
handsomely
at
the
last
general
election
and
the
conservatives
are
not
strong
enough
to
be
ungrateful
these
have
no
master
chapter
xxxii
ways
and
means
the
three
days
that
followed
were
among
the
happiest
days
of
mary
haselden
young
life
lady
maulevrier
had
become
strangely
indulgent
a
softening
influence
of
some
kind
had
worked
upon
that
haughty
spirit
and
it
seemed
as
if
her
whole
nature
was
changed
or
it
might
be
mary
thought
that
this
softer
side
of
her
character
had
always
been
turned
to
lesbia
while
to
mary
herself
it
was
altogether
new
lesbia
had
been
the
peach
on
the
sunny
southern
wall
ripening
and
reddening
in
a
flood
of
sunshine
mary
had
been
the
stunted
fruit
growing
in
a
corner
hidden
among
leaves
blown
upon
by
cold
winds
green
and
hard
and
sour
for
lack
of
the
warm
bright
light
and
now
mary
felt
the
sunshine
and
grew
glad
and
gay
in
those
glowing
beams
grandmother
i
believe
you
are
beginning
to
love
me
she
said
bending
over
to
arrange
the
invalid
pillows
in
the
july
morning
the
fresh
mountain
air
blowing
in
upon
old
and
young
from
the
great
open
window
like
a
caress
am
beginning
to
know
you
answered
lady
maulevrier
gently
think
it
is
the
magic
of
love
mary
that
has
sweetened
and
softened
your
nature
and
endeared
you
to
me
i
think
you
have
grown
ever
so
much
sweeter
a
girl
since
your
engagement
or
it
may
be
that
you
were
the
same
always
and
it
was
i
who
was
blind
lesbia
was
all
in
all
to
me
all
in
all
and
now
i
am
nothing
to
her
she
murmured
to
herself
rather
than
to
mary
am
so
proud
to
think
that
you
see
an
improvement
in
me
since
my
engagement
said
mary
modestly
have
tried
very
hard
to
improve
myself
so
that
i
might
be
more
worthy
of
him
are
worthy
mary
worthy
of
the
best
and
the
highest
and
i
believe
that
although
you
are
making
what
the
world
calls
a
very
bad
match
you
are
marrying
wisely
you
are
wedding
yourself
to
a
life
of
obscurity
but
what
does
that
matter
if
it
be
a
happy
life
i
have
known
what
it
is
to
pursue
the
phantom
fortune
and
to
find
youth
and
hope
and
happiness
vanish
from
the
pathway
which
i
followed
grandmother
i
wish
you
had
been
able
to
marry
the
man
of
your
choice
answered
mary
tenderly
she
was
ready
to
weep
over
that
wasted
life
of
her
grandmother
to
weep
for
that
forced
parting
of
true
lovers
albeit
the
tragedy
was
half
a
century
old
should
have
been
a
happier
woman
and
a
better
woman
if
fate
had
been
kind
to
me
mary
answered
lady
maulevrier
gravely
now
that
i
am
daily
drawing
nearer
the
land
of
shadows
i
will
not
stand
in
the
way
of
faithful
lovers
i
have
a
fancy
mary
that
i
have
not
many
months
to
live
an
invalid
fancy
said
mary
stooping
down
to
kiss
the
pale
forehead
so
full
of
thought
and
care
a
morbid
fancy
nursed
in
the
monotony
of
this
quiet
room
maulevrier
and
jack
and
i
must
find
some
way
of
amusing
you
will
never
amuse
me
out
of
that
conviction
my
dear
i
can
see
the
shadows
lengthening
and
the
sands
running
out
there
are
but
a
few
grains
left
in
the
glass
mary
and
while
those
last
i
should
like
to
see
you
and
hammond
married
i
should
like
to
feel
that
your
fate
is
settled
before
i
go
god
knows
what
confusion
and
trouble
may
follow
my
death
this
was
said
with
a
sharp
ring
of
despair
am
not
going
to
leave
you
grandmother
said
mary
even
for
the
man
you
love
you
are
a
good
girl
mary
lesbia
has
forsaken
me
for
a
lesser
temptation
that
is
hardly
fair
it
was
your
own
wish
to
have
lesbia
presented
this
season
remonstrated
mary
loyal
to
the
absent
my
dear
i
saw
she
was
very
tired
of
her
life
here
and
i
thought
it
was
better
but
i
sorely
afraid
london
has
spoiled
her
no
mary
you
can
stay
with
me
to
the
end
if
you
like
there
is
room
enough
for
you
and
your
husband
under
this
roof
i
like
this
hammond
his
is
the
only
face
that
ever
recalled
the
face
of
the
dead
yes
i
like
him
and
although
i
know
nothing
about
him
except
what
maulevrier
tells
me
and
that
is
of
the
scantiest
still
i
feel
somehow
that
i
can
trust
him
send
your
lover
to
me
mary
i
want
to
have
a
serious
talk
with
him
mary
ran
off
to
obey
fluttered
blushing
and
trembling
this
idea
of
marriage
in
the
immediate
future
was
to
be
the
last
degree
startling
a
year
had
seemed
a
very
long
time
and
she
had
been
told
that
she
and
her
lover
must
wait
a
year
at
the
very
least
so
that
vision
of
marriage
had
seemed
afar
off
in
the
dim
shadowland
of
the
future
she
had
been
told
nothing
by
her
lover
of
where
she
was
to
live
or
what
her
life
was
to
be
like
when
she
was
his
wife
and
now
she
was
told
that
they
were
to
be
married
almost
immediately
that
they
were
to
live
in
the
house
where
she
had
been
reared
in
that
familiar
land
of
hills
and
waters
that
they
were
to
roam
about
the
dales
and
mountains
together
they
two
as
man
and
wife
the
whole
thing
was
wonderful
bewildering
impossible
almost
this
was
on
the
first
morning
after
hammond
arrival
maulevrier
had
gone
off
to
hunt
the
rotha
for
otters
and
was
up
to
his
waist
in
the
water
no
doubt
by
this
time
hammond
was
strolling
up
and
down
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
house
looking
at
the
green
expanse
of
fairfield
the
dark
bulk
of
seat
sandal
the
nearer
crests
of
helm
crag
and
silver
howe
are
to
come
to
her
ladyship
directly
please
said
mary
going
up
to
him
he
took
both
her
hands
drew
her
nearer
to
him
smiling
down
at
her
they
had
been
sitting
side
by
side
at
the
breakfast
table
ago
he
waiting
upon
her
as
she
poured
out
the
tea
yet
by
his
tender
greeting
and
the
delight
in
his
face
it
might
have
been
supposed
they
had
not
met
for
weeks
such
are
the
sweet
inanities
of
love
does
her
ladyship
want
with
me
darling
and
why
are
you
blushing
he
asked
i
think
she
is
going
to
talk
about
our
marriage
faltered
mary
why
i
will
talk
to
her
upon
this
theme
until
mine
eyelids
can
no
longer
wag
quoted
hammond
me
to
her
mary
i
hope
her
ladyship
is
growing
sensible
is
very
kind
very
sweet
she
has
changed
so
much
of
late
mary
went
with
him
to
the
door
of
her
ladyship
and
there
left
him
to
go
in
alone
she
went
to
the
library
that
room
over
which
a
gloomy
shadow
seemed
to
have
hung
ever
since
that
awful
winter
afternoon
when
mary
found
lady
maulevrier
lying
on
the
floor
in
the
twilight
but
it
was
a
noble
room
and
in
her
studious
hours
mary
loved
to
sit
here
walled
round
with
books
and
able
to
consult
or
dip
into
as
many
volumes
as
she
liked
however
her
mind
was
not
attuned
to
study
she
sat
with
a
volume
of
macaulay
open
before
her
but
her
thoughts
were
not
with
the
author
she
was
wondering
what
those
two
were
saying
in
the
room
overhead
and
finding
all
attempts
at
reading
futile
she
let
her
head
sink
back
upon
the
cushion
of
her
deep
luxurious
chair
and
sat
with
her
dreamy
eyes
fixed
on
the
summer
landscape
and
her
thoughts
with
her
lover
lady
maulevrier
looked
very
wan
and
tired
in
the
bright
morning
light
when
hammond
seated
himself
beside
her
sofa
the
change
in
her
appearance
since
the
spring
was
more
marked
than
it
had
seemed
to
him
last
night
in
the
dim
lamplight
yes
there
was
need
here
for
a
speedy
settlement
of
all
earthly
matters
the
traveller
was
nearing
the
mysterious
end
of
the
journey
the
summons
might
come
at
any
hour
hammond
i
feel
a
confidence
in
your
integrity
your
goodness
of
heart
and
high
principle
which
i
never
thought
i
could
feel
for
a
man
of
whom
i
know
so
little
began
lady
maulevrier
gravely
i
know
of
you
or
your
antecedents
is
what
my
grandson
has
told
me
and
i
must
say
that
the
information
so
given
has
been
very
meagre
and
yet
i
believe
in
you
and
yet
i
am
going
to
trust
you
wholly
blindly
implicitly
and
i
am
going
to
give
you
my
granddaughter
ever
so
much
sooner
than
i
intended
to
give
her
to
you
soon
very
soon
if
you
will
have
her
will
have
her
if
there
is
time
to
get
a
special
licence
exclaimed
hammond
bending
down
to
kiss
the
dowager
hand
radiant
with
delight
shall
marry
her
very
soon
if
you
like
marry
her
by
special
licence
in
this
room
i
should
like
to
see
your
wedding
i
have
a
strange
impatience
to
behold
one
of
my
granddaughters
happily
married
to
know
that
her
future
is
secure
that
come
weal
come
woe
she
is
safe
in
the
protection
of
a
brave
true
man
i
am
not
scared
by
the
idea
of
a
little
poverty
that
is
often
the
best
education
for
youth
but
while
you
and
i
are
alone
we
may
as
well
talk
about
ways
and
means
perhaps
you
may
hardly
feel
prepared
to
take
upon
yourself
the
burden
of
a
wife
this
year
well
this
year
as
next
i
am
not
afraid
men
are
so
rash
however
as
long
as
i
live
your
responsibilities
will
be
only
nominal
this
house
will
be
mary
home
and
yours
whenever
you
are
able
to
occupy
it
of
course
i
should
not
like
to
interfere
with
your
professional
efforts
but
if
you
are
cultivating
literature
why
books
can
be
written
at
fellside
better
than
in
london
this
lakeland
of
ours
has
been
the
nursery
of
deathless
writers
but
i
feel
that
my
days
are
numbered
and
when
i
am
dead
well
death
is
always
a
cause
of
change
and
trouble
of
some
kind
and
mary
will
profit
very
little
by
my
death
the
bulk
of
my
fortune
is
left
to
lesbia
i
have
taught
her
to
consider
herself
my
heiress
and
it
would
be
unjust
to
alter
my
will
do
not
dream
of
such
a
thing
there
is
no
need
mary
will
be
rich
enough
exclaimed
hammond
hastily
five
hundred
a
year
and
the
fruits
of
your
industry
said
lady
maulevrier
yes
with
modest
aspirations
and
simple
habits
people
can
live
happily
honourably
on
a
few
hundreds
a
year
and
if
you
really
mean
to
devote
yourself
to
literature
and
do
not
mind
burying
yourself
alive
in
this
lake
district
until
you
have
made
your
name
as
a
writer
why
the
problem
of
ways
and
means
will
be
easily
solved
lady
maulevrier
i
am
not
afraid
of
ways
and
means
that
is
the
last
question
which
need
trouble
you
i
told
lesbia
when
i
offered
myself
to
her
nearly
a
year
ago
that
if
she
would
trust
me
if
she
would
cleave
to
me
poverty
should
never
touch
her
sordid
care
should
never
come
near
her
dwelling
but
she
could
not
believe
me
she
was
like
thomas
the
twin
i
could
show
her
no
palpable
security
for
my
promise
and
she
would
not
believe
for
the
promise
sake
mary
trusted
me
and
mary
shall
not
regret
her
confidence
it
was
different
with
lesbia
sighed
lady
maulevrier
taught
her
to
be
ambitious
she
had
been
schooled
to
set
a
high
price
upon
herself
i
know
she
cared
for
you
very
much
even
but
she
could
not
face
poverty
or
if
you
like
i
will
say
that
she
could
not
face
an
obscure
existence
sacrifice
her
ambition
a
justifiable
ambition
in
one
so
lovely
at
the
bidding
of
her
first
wooer
and
then
again
she
was
told
that
if
she
married
you
she
would
for
ever
forfeit
my
regard
you
must
not
blame
her
for
obeying
me
do
not
blame
her
for
i
have
won
the
peerless
pearl
the
jewel
above
all
price
a
perfect
woman
and
now
dear
lady
maulevrier
give
me
but
your
consent
and
i
am
off
to
york
this
afternoon
to
interview
the
archbishop
and
get
the
special
licence
which
will
allow
me
to
wed
my
darling
here
by
your
couch
afternoon
have
no
objection
to
your
getting
the
licence
immediately
but
you
must
let
me
write
a
cheque
before
you
go
a
special
licence
is
expensive
i
believe
it
costs
fifty
pounds
it
cost
a
thousand
i
should
not
think
it
dear
but
i
have
a
notion
that
i
shall
be
able
to
get
the
licence
cheap
you
have
made
me
wild
with
happiness
you
must
not
refuse
my
cheque
i
must
lady
maulevrier
i
am
not
quite
such
a
pauper
as
you
think
me
fifty
pounds
and
the
expenses
of
the
journey
an
outlay
altogether
unexpected
on
your
part
i
begin
to
fear
that
you
are
very
reckless
a
spendthrift
shall
never
marry
my
granddaughter
with
my
consent
have
never
yet
spent
above
half
my
income
lady
maulevrier
looked
at
him
in
wonderment
and
perplexity
had
the
young
man
gone
suddenly
out
of
his
mind
overwhelmed
by
the
greatness
of
his
bliss
i
thought
you
were
poor
she
faltered
has
pleased
you
to
think
so
dear
lady
maulevrier
but
i
have
more
than
enough
for
all
my
wants
and
i
shall
be
able
to
provide
a
fitting
home
for
my
mary
when
you
can
spare
her
to
preside
over
her
own
establishment
seemed
rather
a
big
word
but
lady
maulevrier
supposed
that
in
this
case
it
meant
a
cook
and
housemaid
with
perhaps
later
on
a
boy
in
buttons
to
break
windows
and
block
the
pantry
sink
with
missing
teaspoons
hammond
this
is
quite
an
agreeable
surprise
she
said
after
a
brief
silence
really
thought
you
were
poor
as
poor
as
a
young
man
of
gentlemanlike
habits
could
be
and
yet
exist
perhaps
you
will
wonder
why
thinking
this
i
brought
myself
to
consent
to
your
marriage
with
my
granddaughter
was
a
great
proof
of
your
confidence
in
me
or
in
providence
replied
hammond
smiling
was
no
such
thing
i
was
governed
by
a
sentiment
a
memory
it
was
my
love
for
the
dead
which
softened
my
heart
towards
you
john
hammond
he
murmured
softly
was
but
one
man
in
this
world
i
ever
fondly
loved
the
love
of
my
youth
my
dearest
and
best
in
the
days
when
my
heart
was
fresh
and
innocent
and
unambitious
that
man
was
ronald
hollister
afterwards
lord
hartfield
and
yours
is
the
only
face
that
ever
recalled
his
to
my
mind
it
is
but
a
vague
likeness
a
look
now
and
then
but
slight
as
that
likeness
is
it
has
been
enough
to
make
my
heart
yearn
towards
you
as
the
heart
of
a
mother
to
her
son
john
hammond
knelt
beside
the
sofa
and
bent
his
handsome
face
over
the
pale
face
on
the
pillow
imprinting
such
a
kiss
as
a
son
might
have
given
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
lady
maulevrier
think
that
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
dead
which
blesses
you
for
your
fidelity
to
old
memories
he
said
tenderly
chapter
xxxiii
by
special
licence
after
that
interview
with
john
hammond
all
the
arrangements
for
the
marriage
were
planned
by
lady
maulevrier
with
a
calm
and
capacity
which
seemed
extraordinary
in
one
so
frail
and
helpless
for
a
little
while
after
hammond
left
her
she
remained
lost
in
a
reverie
deeply
affected
by
the
speech
and
manner
of
her
granddaughter
lover
as
he
gave
her
that
first
kiss
of
duty
and
affection
the
affection
of
one
who
in
that
act
declared
the
allegiance
of
a
close
and
holy
bond
yes
she
told
herself
this
marriage
humble
as
it
might
be
was
altogether
satisfactory
her
own
feeling
towards
the
man
of
her
granddaughter
choice
was
one
of
instinctive
affection
her
heart
had
yearned
to
him
from
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
but
she
had
schooled
herself
to
hide
all
indications
of
her
liking
for
him
she
had
made
every
effort
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
deeming
his
very
merits
a
source
of
danger
in
a
household
where
there
were
two
fresh
impressionable
girls
and
despite
all
her
caution
and
care
he
had
succeeded
in
winning
one
of
those
girls
and
she
was
glad
very
glad
that
he
had
so
succeeded
in
baffling
her
prudence
and
now
it
was
agreeable
to
discover
that
he
was
not
quite
such
a
pauper
as
she
had
supposed
him
to
be
her
heart
felt
lighter
than
it
had
been
for
some
time
when
she
set
about
planning
the
wedding
the
first
step
in
the
business
was
to
send
for
james
steadman
he
came
immediately
grave
and
quiet
as
of
old
and
stood
with
his
serious
eyes
bent
upon
the
face
of
his
mistress
awaiting
her
instructions
mary
is
going
to
be
married
to
hammond
by
special
licence
in
this
room
afternoon
if
it
can
be
managed
so
soon
said
lady
maulevrier
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
my
lady
answered
steadman
without
the
faintest
indication
of
surprise
are
you
so
particularly
glad
asked
his
mistress
looking
at
him
sharply
lady
mary
presence
in
this
house
is
a
source
of
danger
to
your
arrangements
she
is
very
energetic
and
enterprising
very
shrewd
and
well
she
is
a
woman
so
i
suppose
there
can
be
no
harm
in
saying
she
is
somewhat
inquisitive
things
will
be
much
safer
here
when
lady
mary
is
gone
she
will
not
be
gone
she
is
not
going
away
except
for
a
very
brief
honeymoon
i
can
not
possibly
do
without
her
she
has
become
necessary
to
my
life
steadman
and
there
is
so
little
left
of
that
life
now
that
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
sacrifice
the
last
gleams
of
sunshine
the
girl
is
very
sweet
and
loving
and
true
i
was
not
half
fond
enough
of
her
in
the
past
but
she
has
made
herself
very
dear
to
me
of
late
there
are
many
things
in
this
life
steadman
which
we
only
find
out
too
late
surely
my
lady
lady
mary
will
leave
fellside
to
go
to
a
home
of
her
own
after
her
marriage
i
tell
you
steadman
his
mistress
answered
with
a
touch
of
impatience
mary
and
her
husband
will
make
this
house
their
home
so
long
as
i
am
here
it
will
not
be
long
grant
it
may
be
very
long
before
you
cease
to
be
mistress
here
answered
steadman
with
real
feeling
and
then
in
a
lower
tone
he
went
on
me
my
lady
for
the
suggestion
but
do
you
think
it
wise
to
have
hammond
here
as
a
resident
should
it
not
be
wise
hammond
is
a
gentleman
my
lady
but
any
accident
such
as
that
which
brought
lady
mary
into
the
old
garden
such
accident
need
occur
it
must
not
occur
steadman
exclaimed
lady
maulevrier
with
kindling
eyes
she
who
had
so
long
ruled
supreme
was
not
inclined
to
have
any
desire
of
hers
questioned
must
have
been
gross
carelessness
that
day
carelessness
on
your
part
or
that
stable
door
would
never
have
been
left
open
the
key
ought
to
have
been
in
your
possession
it
ought
not
to
have
been
in
the
power
of
the
stableman
to
open
that
door
as
to
hammond
presence
at
fellside
i
can
not
see
any
danger
any
reason
why
harm
should
come
of
it
more
than
of
lord
maulevrier
presence
here
in
the
past
two
gentlemen
are
so
different
my
lady
said
steadman
with
a
gloomy
brow
lordship
is
so
and
careless
his
mind
taken
up
with
his
horses
guns
dogs
fishing
shooting
and
all
kinds
of
sport
he
is
not
a
gentleman
to
take
much
notice
of
anything
out
of
his
own
line
but
this
hammond
is
different
a
very
thoughtful
gentleman
an
inquiring
mind
as
one
would
say
you
are
getting
cowardly
in
your
old
age
the
danger
such
a
risk
as
you
hint
at
must
be
growing
less
and
less
every
day
after
forty
years
of
security
echoed
steadman
with
a
monosyllabic
laugh
which
expressed
intense
bitterness
forty
years
during
which
i
have
felt
myself
upon
the
edge
of
a
precipice
every
day
and
every
hour
security
but
perhaps
you
are
right
my
lady
i
am
growing
old
and
nervous
a
feebler
man
than
i
was
a
few
years
ago
feebler
in
body
and
mind
let
hammond
make
his
home
here
if
it
pleases
your
ladyship
to
have
him
so
long
as
i
am
well
and
able
to
get
about
there
can
be
no
danger
of
anything
awkward
happening
lady
maulevrier
looked
alarmed
you
have
no
expectation
of
falling
ill
i
hope
steadman
you
have
no
premonition
of
any
malady
my
lady
none
except
the
malady
of
old
age
i
feel
that
i
am
not
the
man
i
once
was
that
is
all
my
brain
is
getting
woolly
and
my
sight
is
clouded
now
and
then
and
if
i
were
to
fall
ill
suddenly
it
would
be
terrible
it
would
be
a
dire
calamity
there
is
your
wife
certainly
to
look
after
things
but
wife
would
do
her
best
my
lady
she
is
a
faithful
creature
but
she
is
not
yes
without
any
unkindness
i
must
say
that
steadman
is
not
a
genius
steadman
you
must
not
fail
me
i
am
at
the
mere
idea
exclaimed
lady
maulevrier
forty
years
great
god
it
would
be
terrible
lesbia
mary
maulevrier
the
great
malignant
babbling
world
outside
these
doors
i
am
hemmed
round
with
perils
for
god
sake
preserve
your
strength
take
care
of
your
health
you
are
my
strong
rock
if
you
feel
that
there
is
anything
amiss
with
you
or
that
your
strength
is
failing
consult
horton
neglect
no
precaution
the
safety
of
this
house
of
the
family
honour
hangs
upon
you
do
not
agitate
yourself
my
lady
entreated
steadman
was
wrong
to
trouble
you
with
my
fears
i
shall
not
fail
you
be
sure
although
i
am
getting
old
i
shall
hold
out
to
the
end
end
can
not
be
very
far
off
said
lady
maulevrier
gloomily
thought
that
forty
years
ago
my
lady
but
you
are
right
the
end
must
be
near
now
yes
it
must
be
near
and
now
my
lady
your
orders
about
the
wedding
will
take
place
as
i
told
you
in
this
room
you
will
go
to
the
vicar
and
ask
him
to
officiate
his
two
daughters
will
no
doubt
consent
to
be
lady
mary
bridesmaids
you
will
make
the
request
in
my
name
perhaps
the
vicar
will
call
this
afternoon
and
talk
matters
over
with
me
lady
mary
and
her
husband
will
go
to
cumberland
for
a
brief
honeymoon
a
week
at
most
and
then
they
will
come
back
to
fellside
tell
power
to
prepare
the
east
wing
for
them
she
will
make
one
of
the
rooms
into
a
boudoir
for
lady
mary
and
let
everything
be
as
bright
and
pretty
as
good
taste
can
make
it
she
can
telegraph
to
london
for
any
new
furniture
that
may
be
wanted
to
complete
her
arrangements
and
now
send
lady
mary
to
me
mary
came
fresh
from
the
where
she
had
been
walking
with
her
lover
her
lover
of
her
husband
he
had
told
her
how
he
was
to
start
for
york
directly
after
luncheon
and
to
come
back
by
the
earliest
train
next
day
and
how
they
two
were
to
be
married
afternoon
is
more
wonderful
than
any
dream
that
i
ever
dreamt
exclaimed
mary
how
can
it
be
i
have
not
even
a
wedding
gown
fig
for
wedding
gowns
it
is
mary
i
am
to
wed
not
her
gown
were
you
clad
like
patient
grisel
i
should
be
content
besides
you
have
no
end
of
pretty
gowns
and
you
are
to
be
dressed
for
travelling
remember
for
i
am
going
to
carry
you
off
to
lodore
directly
we
are
married
and
you
will
have
to
clamber
up
the
rocky
bed
of
the
waterfall
to
see
the
sun
set
behind
the
borrowdale
hills
in
your
wedding
gown
it
had
better
be
one
of
those
neat
little
tailor
gowns
which
become
you
so
well
will
wear
whatever
you
tell
me
answered
mary
shall
always
dress
to
please
you
and
not
the
outside
world
you
my
griselda
some
day
you
shall
be
dressed
as
grisel
was
in
a
cloth
of
gold
that
brighte
shone
with
a
coroune
of
many
a
riche
stone
you
darling
when
you
are
lord
chancellor
and
till
that
day
comes
i
will
wear
tailor
gowns
anything
you
like
cried
mary
laughing
she
ran
to
her
grandmother
room
ineffably
content
without
a
thought
of
trousseau
or
finery
but
then
mary
haselden
was
one
of
those
few
young
women
for
whom
life
is
not
a
question
of
fashionable
raiment
i
am
going
to
send
you
off
upon
your
honeymoon
afternoon
said
lady
maulevrier
smiling
at
the
bright
happy
face
which
was
bent
over
her
you
come
back
and
nurse
a
fretful
old
woman
when
the
honeymoon
is
over
honeymoon
will
never
be
over
answered
mary
joyously
wedded
life
is
to
be
one
long
honeymoon
but
i
will
come
back
in
a
very
few
days
and
take
care
of
you
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
do
without
me
now
that
you
have
learnt
to
love
me
will
you
be
content
to
stay
with
me
when
your
husband
has
gone
to
london
but
i
shall
try
to
prevent
his
going
very
often
or
staying
very
long
i
shall
try
to
wind
myself
into
his
heart
so
that
there
will
be
an
aching
void
there
when
we
are
parted
lady
maulevrier
proceeded
to
tell
mary
all
her
arrangements
three
handsome
rooms
in
the
east
wing
a
bedroom
and
boudoir
were
to
be
made
ready
for
the
couple
fräulein
müller
was
to
be
dismissed
with
a
retiring
pension
in
order
that
lady
mary
and
her
husband
might
feel
themselves
master
and
mistress
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
if
your
husband
really
means
to
devote
himself
to
literature
he
can
have
no
better
workshop
than
the
library
i
have
put
together
said
lady
maulevrier
no
better
adviser
and
guide
than
you
dear
grandmother
you
who
have
read
everything
that
has
been
written
worth
reading
during
the
last
half
century
have
read
a
great
deal
mary
but
i
hardly
know
if
i
am
any
wiser
on
that
account
answered
lady
maulevrier
all
however
much
of
other
people
wisdom
we
may
devour
it
is
in
ourselves
that
we
are
thus
or
thus
our
past
follies
rise
up
against
us
at
the
end
of
life
and
we
see
how
little
our
has
helped
us
to
stand
against
foolish
impulses
against
evil
passions
be
good
mary
and
let
who
will
be
wise
as
the
poet
says
a
faithful
heart
is
your
only
anchor
in
the
stormy
seas
of
life
my
dear
i
am
so
glad
you
are
going
to
be
married
is
very
sudden
said
mary
sudden
yet
in
your
case
that
does
not
much
matter
you
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
about
hammond
i
believe
up
my
mind
i
began
to
worship
him
the
first
night
he
came
here
child
well
there
is
no
need
to
wait
for
settlements
you
have
only
your
allowance
as
lord
maulevrier
daughter
a
first
charge
on
the
estate
which
can
not
be
made
away
with
or
anticipated
and
of
which
no
husband
can
deprive
you
shall
have
every
sixpence
of
it
murmured
mary
hammond
though
he
tells
me
he
is
better
off
than
i
supposed
can
have
nothing
to
settle
so
there
will
be
nothing
forfeited
by
a
marriage
without
settlements
mary
could
not
enter
upon
the
question
it
was
even
of
less
importance
than
the
wedding
gown
the
gong
sounded
for
luncheon
dogcart
is
to
take
hammond
to
the
station
at
two
said
lady
maulevrier
you
had
better
go
and
give
him
his
luncheon
mary
needed
no
second
bidding
she
flew
downstairs
and
met
her
lover
in
the
hall
what
a
happy
luncheon
it
was
fräulein
and
mounched
and
mounched
like
the
sailor
wife
eating
chestnuts
but
those
two
lovers
lunched
upon
moonshine
upon
each
other
little
words
and
little
looks
upon
their
own
ineffable
bliss
they
sat
side
by
side
and
helped
each
other
to
the
nicest
things
on
the
table
but
neither
could
eat
and
they
got
considerably
mixed
in
their
way
of
eating
taking
chutnee
with
strawberry
cream
and
currant
jelly
with
asparagus
what
did
it
matter
everything
tasted
of
bliss
have
had
absolutely
nothing
to
eat
said
mary
piteously
as
the
dogcart
came
grinding
round
upon
the
dry
gravel
i
have
done
splendidly
thanks
i
have
just
had
a
macaroon
and
some
of
that
capital
gorgonzola
god
bless
you
dearest
and
revoir
à
i
shall
be
mary
hammond
cried
mary
clasping
her
hands
it
capital
fun
they
were
in
the
porch
alone
the
servants
were
all
at
dinner
save
the
groom
with
the
cart
miss
müller
was
still
munching
at
the
table
in
the
john
hammond
folded
his
sweetheart
in
his
arms
for
one
brief
embrace
there
was
no
time
for
loitering
in
another
moment
he
was
springing
into
the
cart
a
shake
of
the
reins
and
he
was
driving
slowly
down
the
steep
avenue
is
full
of
partings
mary
said
to
herself
as
she
watched
the
last
glimpse
of
the
dogcart
between
the
trees
down
in
the
road
below
this
one
is
to
be
very
short
thank
god
she
wondered
what
she
should
do
with
herself
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
finally
finding
that
she
was
not
wanted
by
her
grandmother
until
afternoon
tea
she
set
out
upon
a
round
of
visits
to
her
favourite
cottagers
to
bid
them
a
long
farewell
as
a
spinster
be
away
a
long
time
i
suppose
lady
mary
said
one
of
her
humble
friends
be
going
to
switzerland
or
italy
or
some
of
those
foreign
parts
where
great
ladies
and
gentlemen
travel
for
their
honeymoons
but
mary
declared
that
she
would
be
absent
a
week
at
longest
she
was
coming
back
to
take
care
of
her
invalid
grandmother
and
she
was
not
going
to
marry
a
great
gentleman
but
a
man
who
would
have
to
work
for
his
living
she
went
back
to
fellside
and
read
the
and
poured
out
lady
maulevrier
tea
and
sat
on
her
low
stool
by
the
sofa
and
the
old
and
the
young
woman
were
as
happy
and
confidential
together
as
if
they
had
been
always
the
nearest
and
dearest
to
each
other
her
ladyship
had
seen
miss
müller
and
had
informed
that
excellent
person
that
her
services
at
fellside
would
no
longer
be
required
after
lady
mary
marriage
but
that
her
devotion
to
her
duties
during
the
last
fourteen
years
should
be
rewarded
by
a
pension
which
together
with
her
savings
would
enable
her
to
spend
the
rest
of
her
days
in
repose
miss
müller
was
duly
grateful
and
owned
to
a
tender
longing
for
the
and
declared
herself
ready
to
retire
from
her
post
whenever
her
ladyship
pleased
shall
go
back
to
germany
directly
i
leave
you
and
i
shall
live
and
die
there
unless
i
am
wanted
by
one
of
my
old
pupils
but
should
lady
lesbia
or
lady
mary
need
my
services
for
their
daughters
in
days
to
come
they
can
command
me
for
no
one
else
will
i
abandon
the
fatherland
the
fräulein
thus
easily
disposed
of
lady
mary
felt
that
matrimony
would
verily
mean
independence
and
yet
she
was
prepared
to
regard
her
husband
as
her
master
she
meant
to
obey
him
in
all
meekness
and
reverence
of
spirit
she
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
the
whole
of
the
evening
in
her
grandmother
dining
with
the
invalid
for
the
first
time
since
her
illness
lady
maulevrier
talked
much
of
future
and
of
lesbia
but
it
was
evident
that
she
was
full
of
uneasiness
upon
the
latter
subject
do
know
what
lesbia
is
going
to
do
with
her
life
she
said
with
a
sigh
letters
tell
me
of
nothing
but
gowns
and
parties
and
georgina
kirkbank
can
only
expatiate
upon
smithson
wealth
and
the
grand
position
he
is
going
to
occupy
i
should
like
to
see
both
my
granddaughters
married
before
i
die
yes
i
should
like
to
see
lesbia
fate
secure
if
she
were
to
be
only
lady
lesbia
smithson
can
not
fail
to
make
a
good
match
grandmother
said
mary
am
beginning
to
lose
faith
in
her
future
answered
lady
maulevrier
seems
to
be
a
fatality
about
the
career
of
particularly
attractive
girls
they
are
too
confident
of
their
power
to
succeed
in
life
they
trifle
with
fortune
fascinate
the
wrong
people
and
keep
the
right
people
at
arm
length
i
think
if
i
had
been
lesbia
guide
in
society
her
first
season
would
have
counted
for
more
than
it
is
likely
to
count
for
under
lady
kirkbank
management
i
should
have
awakened
lesbia
from
the
dream
of
dress
and
dancing
the
mere
butterfly
life
of
a
girl
who
never
looks
beyond
the
present
moment
but
now
go
and
give
orders
about
your
packing
mary
it
is
past
ten
and
clara
had
better
pack
your
trunks
early
morning
clara
was
a
modest
easedale
damsel
who
had
been
promoted
to
be
lady
mary
personal
attendant
when
the
more
mature
kibble
had
gone
away
with
lady
lesbia
mary
required
very
little
waiting
upon
but
she
was
not
the
less
glad
to
have
a
neat
little
smiling
maiden
devoted
to
her
service
ready
to
keep
her
rooms
neat
and
trim
to
go
on
errands
to
the
cottagers
to
arrange
the
flowers
in
the
old
china
bowls
and
to
make
herself
generally
useful
it
seemed
a
strange
thing
to
have
to
furnish
a
trousseau
from
the
wardrobe
of
everyday
life
a
trousseau
in
which
nothing
except
pairs
of
gloves
a
pair
of
boots
and
a
few
odds
and
ends
of
lace
and
ribbons
would
be
actually
new
mary
thought
very
little
of
the
matter
but
the
position
of
things
struck
her
maid
as
altogether
extraordinary
and
unnatural
should
have
seen
the
things
miss
freeman
had
lady
mary
exclaimed
the
damsel
daughter
of
that
gentleman
from
manchester
who
lives
at
the
gables
you
should
have
seen
her
new
gowns
and
things
when
she
was
married
freeman
maid
keeps
company
with
my
brother
james
he
in
the
stables
at
freeman
you
know
lady
mary
and
she
asked
me
in
to
look
at
the
trousseau
two
days
before
the
wedding
i
never
saw
such
beautiful
dresses
such
hats
such
bonnets
such
jackets
and
mantles
it
was
like
going
into
one
of
those
grand
shops
at
york
and
having
all
the
things
in
the
shop
pulled
out
for
one
to
look
at
such
silks
and
satins
and
trimmed
ah
how
those
dresses
was
trimmed
the
mystery
was
how
the
young
lady
could
ever
get
herself
into
them
or
sit
down
when
she
got
one
of
them
on
of
torture
clara
i
should
hate
such
gowns
even
if
i
were
going
to
marry
a
rich
man
as
i
suppose
miss
freeman
was
a
bit
of
it
lady
mary
she
was
only
going
to
marry
a
bolton
doctor
with
a
small
practice
but
her
maid
told
me
she
was
determined
she
get
all
she
could
out
of
her
pa
in
case
he
should
lose
all
his
money
and
go
bankrupt
they
said
that
trousseau
cost
two
thousand
pounds
clara
i
rather
have
my
tailor
gowns
in
which
i
can
scramble
about
the
ghylls
and
crags
just
as
i
like
there
was
a
pale
yellow
indian
silk
smothered
with
soft
yellow
lace
which
would
serve
for
a
wedding
gown
for
indifferent
as
mary
was
to
the
great
clothes
question
she
wanted
to
look
in
some
wise
as
a
bride
a
neat
cloth
almost
new
from
the
tailor
hands
with
a
little
cloth
toque
to
match
would
do
for
the
wedding
journey
all
the
details
of
wardrobe
were
the
perfection
of
neatness
she
had
grown
very
neat
and
careful
in
her
habits
since
her
engagement
anxious
to
be
industrious
and
frugal
in
all
things
a
really
handy
housewife
for
a
and
now
she
was
told
that
hammond
was
not
so
poor
as
she
had
thought
she
would
not
be
obliged
to
stint
herself
and
manage
as
she
had
supposed
when
she
went
about
among
the
cottagers
taking
lessons
in
household
economy
it
was
almost
a
disappointment
she
and
clara
finished
the
packing
that
night
mary
being
much
too
excited
for
the
possibility
of
sleep
there
was
not
much
to
pack
only
one
roomy
american
trunk
a
trunk
which
held
everything
a
gladstone
bag
for
things
that
might
possibly
be
wanted
in
a
hurry
and
a
handsome
maulevrier
last
birthday
gift
to
his
sister
mary
had
received
no
gifts
from
her
lover
save
the
plain
gold
engagement
ring
and
a
few
new
books
sent
straight
from
the
publishers
clara
took
care
to
inform
her
young
mistress
that
miss
sweetheart
had
sent
her
all
manner
of
splendid
presents
scent
bottles
photograph
albums
glove
boxes
and
other
things
of
beauty
albeit
his
means
were
supposed
to
be
it
was
evident
that
clara
disapproved
of
hammond
conduct
in
this
matter
and
even
suspected
him
of
meanness
did
ought
to
have
sent
you
his
photograph
lady
mary
said
clara
with
a
reproachful
air
daresay
he
would
have
done
so
clara
but
he
has
been
photographed
only
once
in
his
life
a
mercy
lady
mary
why
most
young
gentlemen
have
themselves
photographed
in
every
new
place
they
go
to
and
as
hammond
has
been
a
traveller
like
his
lordship
i
made
sure
he
have
been
photographed
in
knickerbockers
and
every
other
kind
of
attitude
mary
had
not
refrained
from
asking
for
her
lover
portrait
and
he
had
told
her
that
he
had
carefully
abstained
from
having
his
countenance
reproduced
in
any
manner
since
his
fifteenth
year
when
he
had
been
photographed
at
his
mother
desire
present
fashion
of
photographs
staring
out
of
every
window
makes
a
man
face
public
property
he
told
mary
do
want
every
street
arab
in
london
to
recognise
me
you
are
not
a
public
man
said
mary
photograph
would
not
be
in
all
the
windows
although
in
my
humble
opinion
you
are
a
very
handsome
man
hammond
blushed
laughed
and
turned
the
conversation
and
mary
had
to
exist
without
any
picture
of
her
lover
shall
paint
me
in
his
grand
reynolds
manner
he
told
mary
oh
jack
when
will
you
and
i
be
able
to
give
a
thousand
or
so
for
a
portrait
when
indeed
but
we
may
as
well
enjoy
our
like
alnaschar
without
smashing
our
basket
of
crockery
and
now
mary
who
had
managed
to
exist
without
the
picture
was
to
have
the
original
he
was
to
be
all
her
own
her
master
her
lord
her
love
after
unto
eternity
in
life
and
in
the
grave
and
in
the
dim
hereafter
beyond
the
grave
they
two
were
to
be
one
in
heaven
there
was
to
be
no
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
mary
was
told
but
her
own
heart
cried
aloud
to
her
that
the
happily
wedded
must
remain
linked
in
heaven
god
would
not
part
the
blessed
souls
of
true
lovers
a
short
sleep
broken
by
happy
dreams
and
it
was
morning
wedding
morning
fairest
of
summer
days
july
in
all
her
beauty
mary
went
to
her
grandmother
room
and
waited
upon
her
at
breakfast
lady
maulevrier
was
in
excellent
spirits
is
arranged
mary
i
have
had
a
telegram
from
hammond
who
has
got
the
licence
and
will
come
at
one
at
three
the
vicar
will
come
to
marry
you
his
daughters
katie
and
laura
acting
as
your
bridesmaids
exclaimed
mary
forgot
all
about
bridesmaids
am
i
really
to
have
any
will
have
two
girls
of
your
own
age
to
bear
you
company
at
any
rate
i
have
asked
dear
old
horton
to
be
present
and
he
fräulein
and
maulevrier
will
complete
the
party
it
will
not
be
a
brilliant
wedding
mary
or
a
costly
ceremonial
except
for
the
licence
poor
jack
will
have
to
pay
for
that
said
mary
with
a
long
face
jack
refused
to
let
me
pay
for
it
answered
lady
maulevrier
is
vastly
independent
and
i
fear
somewhat
reckless
like
him
for
his
independence
but
he
must
be
reckless
said
mary
severely
he
was
to
be
the
master
in
all
things
and
yet
she
was
to
exercise
a
restraining
influence
she
was
to
guard
him
against
his
own
weaknesses
his
too
generous
impulses
her
voice
was
to
be
the
voice
of
prudence
this
is
how
mary
understood
the
marriage
tie
under
ordinary
conditions
mary
would
have
been
in
the
avenue
lying
in
wait
for
her
lover
eager
to
get
the
very
first
glimpse
of
him
when
he
arrived
to
see
him
before
he
had
brushed
the
dust
of
the
journey
from
his
raiment
but
she
hung
back
she
stayed
in
her
room
and
sat
beside
the
sofa
shy
and
even
a
little
downcast
this
lover
who
was
so
soon
to
be
transformed
into
a
husband
was
a
formidable
personage
she
dare
not
rush
forth
to
greet
him
perhaps
he
had
changed
his
mind
by
this
time
and
was
sorry
he
had
ever
asked
her
to
marry
him
perhaps
he
thought
he
was
being
hustled
into
a
marriage
he
had
been
told
that
he
was
to
wait
at
least
a
year
and
now
all
in
a
moment
he
was
sent
off
to
get
a
special
licence
how
could
she
be
quite
sure
that
he
liked
this
kind
of
treatment
if
there
is
any
faith
to
be
placed
in
the
human
countenance
hammond
was
in
no
wise
an
unwilling
bridegroom
for
his
face
beamed
with
happy
light
as
he
came
into
the
room
presently
followed
by
an
elderly
man
with
grey
hair
and
whiskers
and
in
a
strictly
professional
frock
coat
whom
the
butler
announced
as
dorncliffe
lady
maulevrier
looked
startled
somewhat
offended
even
at
this
intrusion
and
she
gave
dorncliffe
a
very
haughty
salutation
which
was
almost
more
crushing
than
no
salutation
at
all
mary
stood
up
by
her
grandmother
sofa
and
looked
rather
frightened
lady
maulevrier
said
hammond
ventured
to
telegraph
to
my
lawyer
to
meet
me
at
york
last
night
and
come
on
here
with
me
this
morning
he
has
prepared
a
settlement
which
i
should
like
you
to
hear
him
read
and
which
he
will
explain
to
you
if
necessary
while
molly
and
i
go
for
a
stroll
in
the
grounds
he
had
never
called
her
molly
before
he
put
his
arm
round
her
with
a
proud
air
of
possession
even
under
her
grandmother
eyes
and
she
nestled
close
up
to
his
side
forgetting
everything
but
the
delight
of
belonging
to
him
they
went
downstairs
and
through
the
billiard
room
to
the
terrace
and
from
the
terrace
to
the
tennis
lawn
where
john
hammond
sat
reading
heine
nearly
a
year
ago
just
before
he
proposed
to
lesbia
you
remember
that
day
asked
mary
looking
at
him
solemnly
remember
every
day
and
every
hour
we
have
spent
together
since
i
began
to
love
you
answered
hammond
but
this
was
before
you
began
to
love
me
said
mary
with
a
piteous
little
grimace
was
while
you
were
loving
lesbia
as
hard
as
ever
you
could
do
you
remember
the
day
you
proposed
to
her
a
lovely
summer
day
like
this
the
lake
just
as
blue
the
sun
shining
upon
fairfield
just
as
it
is
shining
now
and
you
sat
there
reading
heine
those
sweet
sweet
verses
that
seemed
made
of
sighs
and
tears
and
every
now
and
then
you
paused
and
looked
up
at
lesbia
and
there
was
more
love
in
your
eyes
than
in
all
heine
poetry
though
that
brims
over
with
love
how
did
you
know
all
this
molly
you
were
not
here
was
not
very
far
off
i
was
behind
those
bushes
watching
and
listening
i
knew
you
were
in
love
with
lesbia
and
i
thought
you
despised
me
and
i
was
very
very
wretched
and
i
listened
afterwards
when
you
proposed
to
her
there
behind
the
pine
trees
and
i
hated
her
for
refusing
you
and
i
am
afraid
i
hated
you
for
proposing
to
her
i
ought
to
have
been
proposing
to
my
molly
blind
fool
that
i
was
said
hammond
smiling
tenderly
at
her
smiling
though
his
eyes
were
dim
with
tears
own
sweet
love
it
was
a
terrible
mistake
a
mistake
that
might
have
cost
me
the
happiness
of
a
lifetime
but
fate
was
very
good
to
me
and
let
me
have
my
mary
after
all
and
now
let
us
sit
down
under
the
old
red
beech
and
talk
till
it
is
time
to
go
and
get
ready
for
our
wedding
i
suppose
one
ought
to
brush
one
hair
and
wash
one
hands
for
that
kind
of
thing
even
when
the
function
is
not
on
a
ceremonious
scale
mary
laughed
have
a
prettier
gown
than
this
to
be
married
in
although
it
is
a
wedding
gown
she
said
i
have
something
for
you
said
her
lover
in
the
way
of
ornaments
but
i
do
suppose
you
care
to
wear
them
i
run
and
get
them
he
went
back
to
the
house
leaving
mary
sitting
on
the
rustic
bench
under
the
fine
old
copper
beech
a
tree
that
had
been
standing
long
before
lady
maulevrier
enlarged
the
old
stone
house
into
a
stately
villa
he
returned
in
a
few
minutes
bringing
a
morocco
bag
about
the
size
of
those
usually
carried
by
lawyers
or
lawyers
clerks
do
think
i
have
given
you
anything
since
we
were
engaged
mary
he
said
as
he
seated
himself
by
her
side
mary
blushed
remembering
how
clara
the
maid
had
remarked
upon
this
fact
gave
me
my
ring
she
said
looking
down
at
the
massive
band
of
gold
you
have
given
me
ever
so
many
delightful
books
were
very
humble
gifts
molly
but
i
have
brought
you
a
wedding
present
he
opened
the
bag
and
took
out
a
red
morocco
case
and
then
more
red
morocco
cases
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
the
first
looked
new
but
the
others
were
and
passing
shabby
as
if
they
had
been
knocking
about
brokers
shops
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
is
my
wedding
gift
mary
he
said
handing
her
the
new
case
it
contained
an
exquisitely
painted
miniature
of
a
very
beautiful
woman
in
a
large
oval
locket
set
with
sapphires
have
asked
me
for
my
portrait
dearest
he
said
give
you
my
mother
rather
than
my
own
because
i
loved
her
as
i
never
thought
to
love
again
till
i
knew
you
i
should
like
you
to
wear
that
locket
sometimes
mary
as
a
kind
of
link
between
the
love
of
the
past
and
the
love
of
the
present
were
my
mother
living
she
would
welcome
and
cherish
my
bride
and
my
wife
she
is
dead
and
you
and
she
can
never
meet
on
earth
but
i
should
like
you
to
be
familiar
with
the
face
which
was
once
the
light
of
my
life
mary
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
gazed
at
the
face
in
the
miniature
it
was
the
portrait
of
a
woman
of
about
thirty
a
face
of
exquisite
refinement
of
calm
and
pensive
beauty
shall
treasure
this
picture
always
above
all
things
she
said
but
did
you
have
it
set
so
splendidly
jack
no
gems
were
needed
to
give
your
mother
portrait
value
in
my
eyes
know
that
dearest
but
i
wanted
to
make
the
locket
worth
wearing
and
now
for
the
other
cases
the
locket
is
your
lover
free
gift
and
is
yours
to
keep
and
to
bequeath
to
your
children
these
are
heirlooms
and
yours
only
during
your
husband
lifetime
he
opened
one
of
the
largest
cases
and
on
a
bed
of
black
velvet
mary
beheld
a
magnificent
diamond
necklace
with
a
large
pendant
he
opened
another
and
displayed
a
set
of
sprays
for
the
hair
another
contained
earrings
another
bracelets
the
last
a
tiara
are
they
for
gasped
mary
my
wife
to
wear
but
i
could
never
wear
such
things
she
exclaimed
with
an
idea
that
these
must
be
stage
jewellery
are
paste
of
course
very
beautiful
for
people
who
like
that
kind
of
thing
but
i
do
she
felt
deeply
shocked
at
this
evidence
of
bad
taste
on
the
part
of
her
lover
how
the
things
flashed
in
the
sunshine
but
so
did
the
crystal
drops
in
the
old
venetian
girandoles
molly
they
are
not
paste
they
are
brazilian
diamonds
and
as
maulevrier
would
say
they
are
as
good
as
they
make
them
they
are
heirlooms
molly
my
dear
mother
wore
them
in
her
of
wedded
happiness
my
grandmother
wore
them
for
thirty
years
before
her
my
great
grandmother
wore
them
at
the
court
of
queen
charlotte
and
they
were
worn
at
the
court
of
queen
anne
they
are
nearly
two
hundred
years
old
and
those
central
stones
in
the
tiara
came
out
of
a
cap
worn
by
the
great
mogul
and
are
the
largest
table
diamonds
known
they
are
historic
mary
they
must
be
worth
a
fortune
are
valued
at
something
over
seventy
thousand
pounds
why
do
you
sell
them
exclaimed
mary
opening
her
eyes
wide
with
surprise
would
give
you
a
handsome
income
are
not
mine
to
sell
molly
did
not
i
tell
you
that
they
are
heirlooms
they
are
the
family
jewels
of
the
countesses
of
hartfield
what
are
you
hollister
earl
of
hartfield
and
your
adoring
lover
mary
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
a
cry
of
distress
even
that
is
too
dreadful
she
exclaimed
will
be
so
unhappy
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
lesbia
marrying
lord
hartfield
the
son
of
the
man
loved
got
wind
of
her
wish
more
than
a
year
ago
said
hartfield
your
brother
and
he
and
i
hatched
a
little
plot
between
us
he
told
me
lesbia
was
not
worthy
of
his
friend
devotion
told
me
that
she
was
vain
and
ambitious
that
she
had
been
educated
to
be
so
i
determined
to
come
and
try
my
fate
i
would
try
to
win
her
as
plain
john
hammond
if
she
was
a
true
woman
i
told
myself
vanity
and
ambition
would
be
blown
to
the
four
winds
provided
i
could
win
her
love
i
came
i
saw
her
and
to
see
was
to
love
her
god
knows
i
tried
honestly
to
win
her
but
i
had
sworn
to
myself
that
i
would
woo
her
as
john
hammond
and
i
did
not
waver
in
my
resolution
no
not
when
a
word
would
have
turned
the
scale
she
liked
me
i
think
a
little
but
she
did
not
like
the
notion
of
an
obscure
life
as
the
wife
of
a
hardworking
professional
man
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
this
world
had
it
against
love
or
liking
and
she
gave
me
up
i
thank
god
that
the
pomps
and
vanities
prevailed
for
this
happy
chance
gave
me
mary
my
sweet
wordsworthian
damsel
found
like
the
violet
or
the
celandine
by
the
wayside
in
wordsworth
own
country
you
are
lord
hartfield
exclaimed
mary
still
lost
in
wonder
and
with
no
elation
at
this
change
in
the
aspect
of
her
life
always
knew
you
were
a
great
man
but
poor
grandmother
it
will
be
a
dreadful
disappointment
to
her
think
not
i
think
she
has
learned
my
molly
value
rather
late
as
i
learned
it
and
i
believe
she
will
be
glad
that
one
of
her
granddaughters
should
marry
the
son
of
her
first
lover
let
us
go
to
her
love
and
see
if
she
is
reconciled
to
the
idea
and
whether
the
settlement
is
ready
for
execution
dorncliffe
and
his
clerk
were
working
at
it
half
through
the
night
is
the
good
of
a
settlement
asked
mary
sure
i
do
want
one
hartfield
must
not
be
dependent
upon
her
husband
whim
or
pleasure
for
her
milliner
bill
or
her
private
charities
answered
her
lover
smiling
at
her
eagerness
to
repudiate
anything
i
would
rather
be
dependent
on
your
pleasure
i
shall
never
have
any
milliner
bills
and
i
am
sure
you
would
never
deny
me
money
for
charity
shall
not
have
to
ask
me
for
it
except
when
you
have
exceeded
your
i
hope
you
will
do
that
now
and
then
just
to
afford
me
the
pleasure
of
doing
you
a
favour
repeated
mary
to
herself
as
they
went
towards
the
house
i
have
to
call
you
hartfield
i
do
like
the
name
nearly
so
well
as
jack
shall
call
me
jack
for
old
sake
sake
said
hartfield
tenderly
did
you
think
of
such
a
name
as
jack
an
effort
of
genius
was
it
well
first
and
foremost
i
was
christened
ronald
john
all
the
hollisters
are
christened
john
name
of
the
founder
of
the
race
and
secondly
maulevrier
and
i
were
always
plain
morland
and
hammond
in
our
travels
and
always
called
each
other
jack
and
jim
nice
said
mary
you
very
much
mind
our
being
plain
and
hammond
while
we
are
on
our
honeymoon
trip
should
like
it
of
all
things
should
i
people
will
not
take
so
much
notice
of
us
and
we
can
do
what
we
like
and
go
where
we
like
we
even
disguise
ourselves
as
cook
tourists
if
you
like
i
would
not
mind
they
were
at
the
door
of
lady
maulevrier
sitting
room
by
this
time
they
went
in
and
were
greeted
with
smiles
me
look
at
the
countess
of
hartfield
that
is
to
be
in
half
an
hour
said
her
ladyship
mary
mary
what
a
blind
idiot
i
have
been
and
what
a
lucky
girl
you
are
i
told
you
once
that
you
were
wiser
than
lesbia
but
i
little
thought
how
much
wiser
you
had
been
chapter
xxxiv
love
was
new
and
then
but
in
the
spring
henley
regatta
was
over
it
had
passed
like
a
tale
that
is
told
like
epsom
and
ascot
and
all
the
other
glories
of
the
london
season
happy
those
for
whom
the
glory
of
henley
the
grace
of
ascot
the
fever
of
epsom
are
not
as
weary
as
a
tale
bringing
with
them
only
bitterest
memories
of
youth
that
has
fled
of
hopes
that
have
withered
of
that
have
never
been
realised
there
are
some
to
whom
that
mad
hastening
from
pleasure
to
pleasure
that
rush
from
scene
to
scene
of
excitement
that
eager
crowding
into
one
day
and
night
of
gaieties
which
might
fairly
relieve
the
placid
monotony
of
a
month
domesticity
a
month
professional
work
some
there
are
to
whom
this
vanity
fair
is
as
a
treadmill
or
the
turning
of
a
crank
the
felon
deepest
humiliation
purposeless
unprofitable
labour
the
regatta
was
over
and
lady
kirkbank
and
her
charge
hastened
back
to
arlington
street
theirs
was
the
very
first
departure
albeit
smithson
pleaded
hard
for
a
prolongation
of
their
visit
the
weather
was
exceptionally
lovely
he
urged
water
picnics
were
delightful
just
now
the
banks
were
alive
with
the
colour
of
innumerable
wild
flowers
as
beautiful
and
more
poetical
than
the
gorgeous
flora
of
the
amazon
or
the
paraguay
river
and
lady
lesbia
had
developed
a
genius
for
punting
and
leaning
against
her
pole
with
her
hair
flying
loose
and
sleeves
rolled
up
above
the
elbow
she
was
a
subject
for
canvas
or
marble
millais
or
adams
acton
we
are
in
italy
i
will
have
her
modelled
just
in
that
attitude
and
that
dress
said
smithson
will
make
a
lovely
companion
for
my
reading
girl
one
all
repose
and
reverie
the
other
all
life
and
action
dear
lady
kirkbank
you
really
must
stay
for
another
week
at
least
why
go
back
to
the
smoke
and
sultriness
of
town
here
we
can
almost
live
on
the
water
and
i
will
send
to
london
for
some
people
to
make
music
for
us
in
the
evenings
or
if
you
miss
your
little
game
at
nap
we
will
play
for
an
hour
or
so
every
night
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
if
my
house
is
not
pleasant
for
you
house
is
charming
and
i
shall
be
here
only
too
often
in
the
days
to
come
you
will
have
more
than
enough
of
me
i
promise
you
replied
georgie
with
her
girlish
laugh
we
must
not
stop
a
day
longer
now
people
would
begin
to
talk
besides
we
have
engagements
for
every
hour
of
the
week
that
is
coming
and
for
a
fortnight
after
and
then
i
suppose
i
ought
to
take
lesbia
to
the
north
to
see
her
grandmother
and
to
discuss
all
the
preparations
and
arrangements
for
this
very
serious
event
in
which
you
and
lesbia
are
to
be
the
chief
performers
shall
be
very
glad
to
go
to
grasmere
myself
and
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
my
future
said
smithson
will
be
charmed
with
her
she
belongs
to
the
old
school
something
of
a
fossil
perhaps
but
a
very
dignified
fossil
she
has
grown
old
in
a
rustic
seclusion
and
knows
less
of
world
than
a
mother
abbess
but
she
has
read
immensely
and
is
wonderfully
clever
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
that
she
has
very
lofty
ideas
about
her
granddaughter
and
i
believe
she
will
only
be
reconciled
to
lesbia
marriage
with
a
commoner
by
the
notion
that
you
are
sure
of
a
peerage
i
ventured
to
hint
as
much
in
my
letter
to
lady
maulevrier
yesterday
a
shade
of
sullenness
crept
over
horace
smithson
visage
should
hope
that
such
settlements
as
i
am
in
a
position
to
make
will
convince
lady
maulevrier
that
i
am
a
respectable
suitor
for
her
granddaughter
ex
peerage
he
said
somewhat
haughtily
dear
smithson
did
i
not
tell
you
that
poor
lady
maulevrier
is
a
century
behind
the
times
exclaimed
lady
kirkbank
with
an
aggrieved
look
she
were
one
of
of
course
she
would
know
that
wealth
is
the
paramount
consideration
and
that
you
are
quite
the
best
match
of
the
season
but
she
is
dreadfully
poor
dear
thing
and
she
must
have
amused
herself
with
the
of
seeing
lesbia
a
duchess
or
something
of
that
kind
i
shall
tell
her
that
lesbia
can
be
one
of
the
queens
of
society
without
having
strawberry
leaves
on
her
coach
panels
and
that
my
dear
friend
horace
smithson
is
a
much
better
match
than
a
seedy
duke
so
do
look
cross
my
dear
fellow
in
me
you
have
a
friend
who
will
never
desert
you
said
smithson
inwardly
resolving
that
so
soon
as
this
little
transaction
of
his
marriage
were
over
he
would
see
as
little
of
georgie
kirkbank
and
her
cotton
frocks
and
schoolgirl
hats
as
bare
civility
would
allow
he
had
promised
her
that
she
should
be
the
richer
by
a
neat
little
bundle
of
fat
and
flourishing
railway
stock
when
his
happiness
was
secured
and
he
was
not
going
to
break
his
promise
but
he
did
not
mean
to
give
george
and
georgie
free
quarters
at
rood
hall
or
at
cowes
or
deauville
and
he
meant
to
withdraw
his
wife
altogether
from
lady
kirkbank
pinchbeck
set
what
were
lesbia
feelings
in
the
early
morning
after
the
last
day
of
the
regatta
as
she
slowly
paced
the
lavender
walk
in
the
garden
alone
for
happily
smithson
was
not
so
early
a
riser
as
the
damsel
and
she
had
this
fresh
morning
hour
to
herself
of
what
was
she
thinking
as
she
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
broad
gravel
walk
between
two
rows
of
tall
old
bushes
on
which
masses
of
purple
blossom
stood
up
from
the
pale
grey
foliage
silvery
where
the
summer
breeze
touched
it
well
she
was
thinking
first
what
a
grand
old
place
rood
hall
was
and
that
it
was
in
a
manner
hers
henceforward
she
was
to
be
mistress
of
this
house
and
of
other
houses
each
after
its
fashion
as
perfect
as
rood
hall
she
was
to
have
illimitable
money
at
her
command
to
spend
and
give
away
as
she
liked
she
who
yesterday
had
been
tortured
by
the
idea
of
owing
a
paltry
three
thousand
pounds
was
henceforward
to
count
her
thousands
by
the
hundred
her
senses
reeled
before
that
dazzling
vision
of
figures
with
rows
of
ciphers
after
them
one
cipher
more
or
less
meaning
the
difference
between
thousands
and
millions
everybody
had
agreed
in
assuring
her
that
smithson
was
inordinately
rich
everybody
had
considered
it
his
or
her
business
to
give
her
information
about
the
gentleman
income
clearly
implying
thereby
that
in
the
opinion
of
society
smithson
merits
as
a
suitor
were
a
question
of
so
much
bullion
could
she
doubt
she
who
had
learned
in
one
short
season
to
know
what
the
world
was
made
of
and
what
it
most
valued
could
she
steeped
to
the
lips
in
the
wisdom
of
lady
kirkbank
set
doubt
for
an
instant
that
she
was
making
a
better
match
in
the
eye
of
society
than
if
she
had
married
a
man
of
the
highest
lineage
in
all
england
a
peer
of
the
highest
rank
without
large
means
she
knew
that
money
was
power
that
a
man
might
begin
life
as
a
or
a
greengrocer
a
knacker
or
a
dust
contractor
and
climb
to
the
topmost
pinnacles
were
he
only
rich
enough
she
knew
that
society
would
eat
such
a
man
dinners
and
dance
at
his
wife
balls
and
pretend
to
think
him
an
altogether
exceptional
man
make
believe
to
admire
him
for
his
own
sake
to
think
his
wife
most
brilliant
among
women
if
he
were
only
rich
enough
and
could
she
doubt
that
society
would
bow
down
to
her
as
lady
lesbia
smithson
she
had
learned
a
great
deal
in
her
single
season
and
she
knew
how
society
was
influenced
and
governed
almost
as
well
as
sir
robert
walpole
knew
how
human
nature
could
be
moulded
and
directed
at
the
will
of
a
shrewd
diplomatist
she
knew
that
in
the
fashionable
world
every
man
and
every
woman
every
child
even
has
his
or
her
price
and
may
be
bought
and
sold
at
pleasure
she
had
her
price
she
lesbia
the
pearl
of
grasmere
and
the
price
having
been
fairly
bidden
she
had
surrendered
to
the
bidder
suppose
i
always
meant
to
marry
him
she
thought
pausing
in
her
promenade
to
gaze
across
the
verdant
landscape
a
fertile
vale
against
a
background
of
low
hills
all
the
landscape
to
the
edge
of
those
hills
belonged
to
smithson
i
must
have
meant
to
give
way
at
last
or
i
should
hardly
have
tolerated
his
attentions
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
refuse
such
a
place
as
this
and
he
is
quite
gentlemanlike
and
as
i
have
done
with
all
romantic
ideas
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
not
learn
to
like
him
very
much
she
dismissed
the
idea
of
smithson
lightly
with
this
conclusion
which
she
believed
very
virtuous
and
then
as
she
resumed
her
walk
her
thoughts
reverted
to
the
park
lane
palace
hardly
know
whether
i
like
it
she
mused
languidly
as
it
is
it
is
only
a
reproduction
of
bygone
splendour
and
it
is
painfully
excruciating
now
for
my
own
part
i
would
much
rather
have
the
shabbiest
old
house
which
had
belonged
to
one
ancestors
which
had
come
to
one
as
a
heritage
by
divine
right
as
it
were
instead
of
being
bought
with
newly
made
money
to
my
mind
it
would
rank
higher
yet
i
doubt
if
anybody
nowadays
sets
a
pin
value
upon
ancestors
people
ask
who
is
he
but
they
only
mean
how
much
has
he
and
provided
a
person
is
not
absolutely
in
trade
not
actually
engaged
in
selling
soap
or
matches
or
mustard
society
does
care
a
straw
how
his
money
has
been
made
the
only
secondary
question
is
how
long
will
it
last
and
that
is
of
course
important
musing
thus
wordly
wisdom
personified
the
maiden
looked
up
and
saw
her
lover
entering
at
the
light
little
iron
gate
which
gave
entrance
to
this
feminine
eden
she
went
to
meet
him
looking
all
simplicity
and
freshness
in
her
white
morning
gown
and
neat
little
dunstable
hat
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
gazed
at
her
almost
as
if
this
delicate
beauty
were
some
wild
white
flower
of
the
woods
personified
she
gave
him
her
hand
graciously
but
he
drew
her
to
his
breast
and
kissed
her
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
exercising
an
indisputable
right
she
supposed
that
it
was
his
right
and
she
submitted
but
released
herself
as
quickly
as
possible
dearest
how
lovely
you
look
in
this
morning
light
he
exclaimed
all
the
other
women
are
upstairs
making
up
their
faces
to
meet
the
sun
and
we
shall
see
every
shade
of
bismuth
from
pale
mauve
to
purple
is
very
uncivil
of
you
to
say
such
a
thing
of
your
guests
exclaimed
lesbia
they
all
indulge
in
bismuth
you
must
be
quite
aware
of
that
they
call
the
stuff
by
different
names
blanc
rosati
crême
de
milk
of
beauty
perline
opaline
ivorine
but
it
means
bismuth
all
the
same
expose
your
fashionable
beauty
to
the
fumes
of
and
that
dazzling
whiteness
would
turn
to
a
dull
brown
hue
or
even
black
thank
heaven
my
lesbia
wears
real
lilies
and
roses
have
you
been
here
long
half
an
only
wish
i
had
known
i
should
not
have
dawdled
so
long
over
my
dressing
am
very
glad
you
did
not
know
lesbia
answered
coolly
you
suppose
i
never
want
to
be
alone
life
in
london
is
perpetual
turmoil
one
eyes
grow
weary
with
crowds
one
ears
ache
with
trying
to
distinguish
one
voice
among
the
buzz
of
voices
why
go
back
to
town
why
go
back
to
the
turmoil
and
the
treadmill
it
is
only
a
kind
of
treadmill
after
all
though
we
choose
to
call
it
pleasure
stay
here
lesbia
and
let
us
live
upon
the
river
and
among
the
flowers
urged
smithson
with
as
romantic
an
air
as
if
he
had
never
heard
of
contango
or
bulling
and
bearing
and
yet
only
half
an
hour
ago
while
his
valet
was
shaving
him
he
was
debating
within
himself
whether
he
should
be
bear
or
bull
in
his
influence
upon
certain
stock
it
was
supposed
that
he
never
went
near
the
city
that
he
had
shaken
the
dust
of
lombard
street
and
the
house
off
his
shoes
that
his
fortune
was
made
and
he
had
no
further
need
of
speculation
yet
the
proverb
holds
good
with
the
who
has
once
drunk
will
drink
again
of
that
fountain
there
is
no
satiety
and
hear
the
last
of
the
nightingales
he
murmured
are
famous
for
our
nightingales
wonder
you
do
order
a
of
their
tongues
like
that
loathsome
person
in
roman
history
hope
i
shall
never
resemble
any
loathsome
person
why
can
you
not
stay
because
it
is
not
etiquette
lady
kirkbank
says
kirkbank
eh
belle
lady
kirkbank
standing
out
for
etiquette
laugh
at
my
chaperon
sir
upon
what
rock
can
a
poor
girl
lean
if
you
undermine
her
faith
in
her
chaperon
sir
hope
you
will
have
a
better
guardian
before
you
are
a
month
older
i
mean
to
be
a
very
strong
rock
lesbia
you
do
not
know
how
firmly
i
shall
stand
between
you
and
all
the
perils
of
society
you
have
been
but
poorly
guarded
hitherto
talk
as
if
you
mean
to
be
an
abominable
tyrant
said
lesbia
you
do
take
care
i
shall
change
my
mind
and
recall
my
promise
on
that
account
lesbia
every
woman
likes
a
man
who
stands
up
for
his
own
it
is
only
your
invertebrate
husband
whose
wife
drifts
into
the
divorce
court
i
mean
to
keep
and
hold
the
prize
i
have
won
when
is
it
to
be
dearest
our
wedding
day
for
ages
i
hope
some
time
next
summer
at
the
earliest
would
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
keep
me
waiting
a
year
not
would
not
ask
that
if
you
loved
me
are
asking
too
much
said
lesbia
with
a
flash
of
defiance
has
been
nothing
said
about
love
yet
you
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
and
i
said
yes
meaning
that
at
some
remote
period
such
a
thing
might
be
she
knew
that
the
man
was
her
slave
slave
to
her
beauty
slave
to
her
superior
rank
and
she
was
determined
not
to
lessen
the
weight
of
his
chain
by
so
much
as
a
feather
not
that
promise
imply
something
like
love
he
asked
earnestly
it
implied
a
little
gratitude
for
your
devotion
which
i
have
neither
courted
nor
encouraged
a
little
respect
for
your
talents
your
perseverance
a
little
admiration
for
your
wonderful
success
in
life
perhaps
love
may
follow
these
sentiments
naturally
easily
if
you
are
very
patient
but
if
you
talk
about
our
being
married
before
next
year
you
will
simply
make
me
hate
you
i
will
say
very
little
except
to
remind
you
that
there
is
no
earthly
reason
why
we
should
not
be
married
next
month
october
and
november
are
the
best
months
for
rome
and
i
heard
you
say
last
night
you
were
pining
to
see
rome
then
can
not
lady
kirkbank
take
me
to
rome
introduce
you
to
the
rowdiest
people
in
the
city
cried
smithson
i
adore
you
it
is
the
dream
of
my
life
to
be
your
husband
but
if
you
are
going
to
spend
a
winter
in
italy
with
lady
kirkbank
i
renounce
my
right
i
surrender
my
hope
you
will
not
be
the
wife
of
my
dreams
after
that
you
assert
a
right
to
control
my
life
during
our
engagement
little
right
above
all
the
privilege
of
choosing
your
friends
and
that
is
one
reason
why
i
most
fervently
desire
our
marriage
should
not
be
delayed
you
would
find
it
difficult
impossible
perhaps
to
get
out
of
lady
kirkbank
claws
while
you
are
single
but
once
my
wife
that
amiable
old
person
can
be
made
to
keep
her
distance
kirkbank
claws
what
a
horrible
way
in
which
to
speak
of
a
friend
i
thought
you
adored
lady
kirkbank
i
do
we
all
adore
her
but
not
as
a
guide
for
youth
as
a
specimen
of
the
elderly
female
of
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
she
is
perfect
such
gush
such
juvenility
such
broad
views
such
an
utter
absence
of
starch
but
as
a
lamp
for
the
footsteps
of
girlhood
no
we
must
pause
are
very
ungrateful
do
you
know
that
poor
lady
kirkbank
has
been
most
strenuous
in
your
behalf
yes
i
know
that
you
are
not
grateful
intend
to
be
very
grateful
so
grateful
as
to
entirely
satisfy
lady
kirkbank
are
horribly
cynical
that
reminds
me
there
was
a
poor
girl
whom
lady
kirkbank
had
under
her
wing
one
season
a
miss
trinder
to
whom
i
am
told
you
behaved
shamefully
was
a
parson
daughter
who
threw
herself
at
my
head
in
a
most
audacious
way
and
who
behaved
so
badly
egged
on
by
lady
kirkbank
that
i
had
to
take
refuge
in
flight
do
you
suppose
i
am
the
kind
of
man
to
marry
the
first
adventurous
damsel
who
takes
a
fancy
to
my
town
house
and
thinks
it
would
be
a
happy
hunting
ground
for
a
herd
of
brothers
and
sisters
miss
trinder
was
shocking
bad
style
and
her
designs
were
transparent
from
the
very
beginning
i
let
her
flirt
as
much
as
she
liked
and
when
she
began
to
be
seriously
sentimental
i
took
wing
for
the
east
she
pretty
asked
lesbia
not
displeased
at
this
contemptuous
summing
up
of
poor
belle
trinder
story
you
admire
the
flemish
type
as
illustrated
by
rubens
she
was
lovely
a
complexion
of
lilies
and
roses
cabbage
roses
which
were
apt
to
deepen
into
peonies
after
champagne
and
mayonaise
at
ascot
or
sandown
a
figure
oh
well
a
tremendous
figure
hair
of
an
auburn
that
touched
perilously
on
the
confines
of
red
large
serviceable
feet
and
an
appetite
the
appetite
of
a
daughter
reared
upon
short
commons
are
very
cruel
to
a
girl
who
evidently
admired
you
fig
for
her
admiration
she
wanted
to
live
in
my
house
and
spend
my
money
goes
the
gong
exclaimed
lesbia
let
us
go
to
breakfast
you
are
hideously
cynical
and
i
am
wofully
tired
of
you
and
as
they
strolled
back
to
the
house
by
lavender
walk
and
rose
garden
and
across
the
dewy
lawn
lesbia
questioned
herself
as
to
whether
she
was
one
whit
better
or
more
dignified
than
isabella
trinder
she
wore
her
rue
with
a
difference
that
was
all
chapter
xxxv
fancy
pride
and
fickle
maidenhood
the
return
to
arlington
street
meant
a
return
to
the
ceaseless
whirl
of
gaiety
even
at
rood
hall
life
had
been
as
near
an
approach
to
perpetual
motion
as
one
could
hope
for
in
this
world
but
the
excitement
and
the
hurrying
and
scampering
in
berkshire
had
a
rustic
flavour
there
were
moments
that
were
almost
repose
a
breathing
space
between
the
blue
river
and
the
blue
sky
in
a
world
that
seemed
made
of
green
fields
and
hanging
woods
the
plashing
of
waters
and
the
song
of
the
lark
but
in
london
the
very
atmosphere
was
charged
with
hurry
and
agitation
the
freshness
was
gone
from
the
verdure
of
the
parks
the
glory
of
the
rhododendrons
had
faded
the
green
park
below
lady
kirkbank
mansion
was
baked
and
rusty
the
towers
of
the
houses
of
parliament
yonder
were
dimly
seen
in
a
mist
of
heat
london
air
tasted
of
smoke
and
dust
vibrated
with
the
incessant
roll
of
carriages
and
the
trampling
of
multitudinous
feet
there
are
women
of
rank
who
can
take
the
london
season
quietly
and
live
their
own
lives
in
the
midst
of
the
whirl
and
the
riot
women
for
whom
that
circulation
round
and
round
the
fashionable
wheel
has
no
charm
women
who
only
receive
people
they
like
only
go
into
society
that
is
congenial
but
lady
kirkbank
was
not
one
of
these
the
advance
of
age
made
her
only
more
keen
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
she
would
have
abandoned
herself
to
despair
had
the
glass
over
the
mantelpiece
in
her
boudoir
ceased
to
be
choked
and
littered
with
cards
had
her
book
of
engagements
shown
a
blank
page
happily
there
were
plenty
of
people
if
not
all
of
them
the
best
people
who
wanted
sir
george
and
lady
kirkbank
at
their
parties
the
gentleman
was
sporting
and
harmless
the
lady
was
and
just
sufficiently
eccentric
to
be
amusing
without
degenerating
into
a
bore
and
this
year
she
was
asked
almost
everywhere
for
the
sake
of
the
beauty
who
went
under
her
wing
lesbia
had
been
as
a
pearl
of
price
to
her
chaperon
from
a
social
point
of
view
and
now
that
she
was
engaged
to
horace
smithson
she
was
likely
to
be
even
more
valuable
smithson
had
promised
lady
kirkbank
sportively
as
it
were
and
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
as
he
would
have
offered
to
wager
a
dozen
of
gloves
that
were
he
so
happy
as
to
win
her
hand
he
would
find
her
an
investment
for
say
a
thousand
which
would
bring
her
in
twenty
per
cent
nay
more
he
would
also
find
the
thousand
which
would
have
been
the
initial
difficulty
on
poor
georgie
part
but
this
little
matter
was
in
georgie
mind
a
detail
compared
with
the
advantages
to
accrue
to
her
indirectly
from
lesbia
union
with
one
of
the
richest
men
in
london
lady
kirkbank
had
brought
about
many
good
matches
and
had
been
too
often
rewarded
with
base
ingratitude
upon
the
part
of
her
after
marriage
but
there
was
a
touch
of
arcady
in
the
good
nature
and
she
was
always
trustful
she
told
herself
that
lesbia
would
not
be
ungrateful
would
not
basely
kick
down
the
ladder
by
which
she
had
mounted
to
heights
empyrean
would
not
cruelly
shelve
the
friend
who
had
pioneered
her
to
high
fortune
she
counted
upon
making
the
house
in
park
lane
as
her
own
house
upon
being
the
prime
mover
of
all
hospitalities
the
supervisor
of
her
visiting
list
the
shadow
behind
the
throne
there
were
balls
and
parties
nightly
dinners
luncheons
and
yet
there
was
a
sense
of
waning
in
the
glory
of
the
world
everybody
felt
that
the
of
the
season
was
approaching
all
the
really
great
entertainments
were
over
the
cabinet
dinners
the
reception
at
the
foreign
office
the
last
of
the
state
balls
and
concerts
some
of
the
best
people
had
already
left
town
and
senators
were
beginning
to
complain
that
they
saw
no
prospect
of
early
deliverance
there
was
goodwood
still
to
look
forward
to
and
after
goodwood
the
deluge
or
rather
cowes
regatta
about
which
lady
kirkbank
set
were
already
talking
lady
lesbia
was
to
be
at
cowes
for
the
regatta
week
that
was
a
settled
thing
smithson
the
cayman
was
to
be
her
hotel
it
was
to
be
lady
kirkbank
and
lady
lesbia
yacht
for
the
nonce
and
smithson
was
to
live
on
shore
at
his
villa
and
at
that
aristocratic
club
to
which
by
maulevrier
influence
and
on
the
score
of
his
approaching
marriage
with
an
earl
daughter
he
had
been
just
selected
he
would
be
only
lady
kirkbank
visitor
on
board
the
cayman
the
severe
etiquette
of
the
situation
would
therefore
not
be
infringed
and
yet
smithson
would
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
his
betrothed
sole
and
sovereign
mistress
of
his
yacht
and
of
spending
the
long
summer
days
at
her
feet
even
to
lady
lesbia
this
idea
of
the
yacht
was
not
without
its
charm
she
had
never
been
on
board
such
a
yacht
as
the
cayman
she
was
a
good
sailor
as
testified
by
many
an
excursion
in
hired
sailing
boats
at
tynemouth
and
st
bees
and
she
knew
that
she
would
be
the
queen
of
the
hour
she
accepted
smithson
invitation
for
the
cowes
week
more
graciously
than
she
was
wont
to
receive
his
attentions
and
was
pleased
to
say
that
the
whole
thing
would
be
rather
enjoyable
will
be
simple
enchantment
exclaimed
the
more
enthusiastic
georgie
kirkbank
is
nothing
so
rapturous
as
life
on
board
a
yacht
there
is
a
flavour
of
adventure
a
a
in
short
everything
in
the
world
that
i
like
i
shall
wear
my
cotton
frocks
and
give
myself
up
to
enjoyment
lie
on
the
deck
and
look
up
at
the
blue
sky
too
deliciously
idle
even
to
read
the
last
horrid
thing
of
zola
but
the
cowes
regatta
was
nearly
three
weeks
ahead
and
in
the
meantime
there
was
goodwood
and
the
ravelled
threads
of
the
london
season
had
to
be
wound
up
and
by
this
time
it
was
known
everywhere
that
the
affair
between
smithson
and
maulevrier
sister
was
really
on
as
settled
a
business
as
the
entries
and
bets
for
next
year
derby
said
one
lounger
to
another
in
the
of
the
haute
gomme
or
pay
do
you
know
lady
kirkbank
and
lesbia
had
both
written
to
lady
maulevrier
lesbia
writing
somewhat
coldly
very
briefly
and
in
a
half
defiant
tone
to
the
effect
that
she
had
accepted
smithson
offer
and
that
she
hoped
her
grandmother
would
be
pleased
with
a
match
which
everybody
supposed
to
be
extremely
advantageous
she
was
going
to
grasmere
immediately
after
the
cowes
week
to
see
her
dear
grandmother
and
to
be
assured
of
her
approval
in
the
meanwhile
she
was
awfully
busy
there
were
callers
driving
up
to
the
door
at
that
very
moment
and
her
brain
was
racked
by
the
apprehension
that
she
might
not
get
her
new
gown
in
time
for
the
bachelor
ball
which
was
to
be
quite
one
of
the
nicest
things
of
the
year
so
dearest
grandmother
must
excuse
a
hurried
letter
etc
georgie
kirkbank
was
more
effusive
more
lengthy
she
expatiated
upon
the
stupendous
alliance
which
her
sweetest
lesbia
was
about
to
make
and
took
credit
to
herself
for
having
guided
lesbia
footsteps
in
the
right
way
is
a
most
difficult
person
she
wrote
least
error
of
taste
on
your
dear
girl
part
would
have
him
men
with
that
immense
wealth
are
always
suspicious
ready
to
imagine
mercenary
motives
on
their
guard
against
being
trapped
but
lesbia
had
at
her
back
and
she
managed
him
perfectly
he
is
positively
her
slave
and
you
will
be
able
to
twist
him
round
your
little
finger
in
the
matter
of
settlements
you
may
do
what
you
like
with
him
for
the
ground
has
been
thoroughly
prepared
by
lady
maulevrier
reply
was
not
enthusiastic
she
had
no
doubt
smithson
was
a
very
good
match
according
to
the
modern
estimate
of
matrimonial
alliances
in
which
money
seemed
to
be
the
alpha
and
omega
but
she
had
cherished
views
of
another
kind
she
had
hoped
to
see
her
dear
granddaughter
wear
one
of
those
noble
and
historic
names
which
are
a
badge
of
distinction
for
all
time
she
had
hoped
to
see
her
enter
one
of
those
grand
old
families
which
are
a
kind
of
royalty
and
that
lesbia
should
marry
a
man
whose
sole
distinction
consisted
of
an
immense
fortune
amassed
heaven
knows
how
was
a
terrible
blow
to
her
pride
it
is
not
the
first
wrote
lady
maulevrier
pride
has
received
crushing
blows
in
days
past
and
i
ought
to
be
humbled
to
the
dust
but
there
is
a
stubborn
resistance
in
some
natures
which
stands
firm
against
every
shock
you
and
lesbia
will
both
be
surprised
to
hear
that
mary
from
whom
i
expected
so
little
has
made
a
really
great
match
she
was
married
yesterday
afternoon
in
my
morning
room
by
special
licence
to
the
earl
of
hartfield
the
lover
of
her
choice
whom
we
at
fellside
have
all
known
as
plain
john
hammond
he
is
an
admirable
young
man
and
sure
to
make
a
great
figure
in
the
world
as
no
doubt
you
know
better
than
i
do
for
you
are
in
the
way
of
hearing
all
about
him
his
courtship
of
mary
is
quite
an
idyll
and
the
happy
issue
of
this
romantic
has
cheered
and
comforted
me
more
than
anything
that
has
happened
since
lesbia
left
me
this
letter
written
in
fräulein
niggling
little
hand
lady
kirkbank
handed
to
lesbia
who
read
it
through
in
silence
but
when
she
came
to
that
part
of
the
letter
which
told
of
her
sister
marriage
her
cheek
grew
ashy
pale
her
brow
contracted
and
she
started
to
her
feet
and
stared
at
lady
kirkbank
with
wild
dilated
eyes
as
if
she
had
been
stung
by
an
adder
strange
mystification
was
it
said
lady
kirkbank
almost
frightened
at
the
awful
look
in
lesbia
face
which
was
even
worse
than
belle
trinder
expression
when
she
read
the
announcement
of
smithson
flight
mystification
it
was
base
treachery
a
vile
and
wicked
lie
cried
lesbia
furiously
right
had
he
to
come
to
us
under
false
colours
to
pretend
to
be
poor
a
nobody
with
only
the
vaguest
hope
of
making
a
decent
position
in
the
future
and
to
offer
himself
under
such
impossible
conditions
to
a
girl
brought
up
as
i
had
been
a
girl
educated
by
one
of
the
proudest
and
most
ambitious
of
women
to
force
me
to
renounce
everything
except
him
how
could
he
suppose
that
any
girl
so
placed
could
decide
in
his
favour
if
he
had
loved
me
he
would
have
told
me
the
truth
he
would
not
have
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
accept
him
believe
he
is
a
very
high
flown
young
man
said
lady
kirkbank
soothingly
was
never
in
set
you
know
dear
and
i
suppose
he
had
some
old
idea
that
he
would
find
a
girl
who
would
marry
him
for
his
own
sake
and
your
sister
no
doubt
eager
to
marry
poor
child
for
the
sake
of
getting
away
from
that
very
lovely
dungeon
of
lady
maulevrier
snapped
at
the
chance
and
by
a
mere
fluke
she
becomes
a
countess
lesbia
ignored
these
consolatory
remarks
she
was
pacing
the
room
like
a
tigress
her
delicate
cambric
handkerchief
grasped
between
her
two
hands
and
torn
and
rent
by
the
convulsive
action
of
her
fingers
she
could
have
thrown
herself
from
the
balcony
on
to
the
spikes
of
the
area
railings
she
could
have
dashed
herself
against
yonder
big
window
looking
towards
the
green
park
like
a
bird
which
shatters
his
little
life
against
the
glass
barrier
which
he
mistakes
for
the
open
sky
she
could
have
flung
herself
down
on
the
floor
and
grovelled
and
torn
her
hair
she
could
have
done
anything
mad
wicked
desperate
in
the
wild
rage
of
this
moment
me
she
exclaimed
never
loved
me
if
he
had
he
would
have
told
me
the
truth
what
when
i
was
in
his
arms
my
head
upon
his
breast
my
whole
being
surrendered
to
him
adoring
him
what
more
could
he
want
he
must
have
known
that
this
meant
real
love
and
why
should
he
put
it
upon
me
to
fight
so
hard
a
fight
to
brave
my
anger
to
be
cursed
by
her
to
face
poverty
for
his
sake
i
never
professed
to
be
a
heroine
he
knew
that
i
was
a
woman
with
all
a
woman
weakness
a
woman
fear
of
trial
and
difficulty
in
the
future
it
was
a
cowardly
thing
to
use
me
so
was
said
lady
kirkbank
in
the
same
soothing
tone
if
you
liked
this
creature
a
little
in
those
old
days
i
know
you
have
outlived
that
liking
long
ago
course
but
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
know
one
has
been
fooled
cheated
weighed
in
the
balance
and
found
wanting
said
lesbia
scornfully
she
was
taming
down
a
little
by
this
time
ashamed
of
that
outbreak
of
violent
passion
feeling
that
she
had
revealed
too
much
to
lady
kirkbank
was
a
caddish
thing
to
do
said
georgie
this
hartfield
is
just
what
i
always
thought
him
an
insufferable
prig
however
my
sweetest
girl
there
is
really
nothing
to
lament
in
the
matter
your
sister
has
made
a
good
alliance
which
will
score
high
in
your
favour
and
you
are
going
to
marry
a
man
who
is
three
times
as
rich
as
lord
hartfield
yes
and
nothing
but
rich
while
lord
hartfield
is
a
man
of
the
very
highest
standing
belongs
to
the
flower
of
english
nobility
rich
yes
smithson
is
rich
but
as
lady
maulevrier
says
he
has
made
his
money
heaven
knows
how
smithson
has
not
made
his
money
heaven
knows
how
answered
lady
kirkbank
indignantly
has
made
it
in
cochineal
in
iron
in
gunpowder
in
coal
in
all
kinds
of
commodities
everybody
in
the
city
knows
how
he
has
made
his
money
and
that
he
has
a
genius
for
turning
everything
into
gold
if
the
gold
changes
back
into
one
of
the
baser
metals
it
is
only
when
smithson
has
made
all
he
wanted
to
make
and
now
he
has
quite
done
with
the
city
the
house
is
the
only
business
of
his
life
and
he
is
becoming
a
power
in
the
house
you
have
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
your
choice
lesbia
will
try
to
be
proud
of
it
said
lesbia
resolutely
will
not
be
scorned
and
trampled
upon
by
mary
seemed
a
harmless
kind
of
girl
said
lady
kirkbank
as
if
she
had
been
talking
of
a
housemaid
is
a
designing
minx
exclaimed
lesbia
has
set
her
cap
at
that
man
from
the
very
beginning
she
could
not
have
known
that
he
was
lord
hartfield
but
he
was
a
man
and
that
was
enough
for
her
from
this
time
forward
there
was
a
change
in
lady
lesbia
style
and
manner
a
change
very
much
for
the
worse
as
people
thought
but
to
the
taste
of
some
among
lady
kirkbank
set
the
change
was
an
improvement
she
was
gayer
than
of
old
gay
with
a
reckless
vivacity
intensely
eager
for
action
and
excitement
for
cards
and
racing
and
all
the
strongest
stimulants
of
fashionable
life
most
people
ascribed
this
increased
vivacity
this
electric
manner
to
the
fact
of
her
engagement
to
horace
smithson
she
was
giddy
with
her
triumph
dazzled
by
a
vision
of
the
gold
which
was
soon
to
be
hers
if
i
saw
myself
in
a
fair
way
of
being
able
to
write
cheques
upon
such
an
account
as
smithson
i
should
be
as
wild
as
lady
lesbia
said
one
of
the
damsel
military
admirers
at
the
rag
i
believe
the
young
lady
was
slightly
dipped
told
you
that
asked
his
friend
mother
of
mine
answered
the
youth
with
an
apologetic
air
as
if
he
hardly
cared
to
own
such
a
humdrum
relationship
the
dressmaker
was
complaining
wanted
to
see
the
colour
of
lady
lesbia
haselden
money
vulgar
curiosity
asked
my
old
mother
if
she
thought
the
account
was
safe
and
so
on
that
how
i
came
to
know
all
about
it
she
be
able
to
pay
seraphine
next
season
lord
maulevrier
came
back
to
london
directly
after
his
sister
wedding
the
event
which
came
off
so
quietly
so
happily
filled
him
with
unqualified
joy
he
had
hoped
from
the
very
first
that
his
molly
would
win
the
cup
even
while
lesbia
was
making
all
the
running
as
he
said
afterwards
and
molly
had
won
and
was
the
wife
of
one
of
the
best
young
men
in
england
maulevrier
albeit
unused
to
the
shed
a
tear
or
two
for
very
joy
as
the
sister
he
loved
and
the
friend
of
his
boyhood
and
youth
stood
side
by
side
in
the
quiet
room
at
grasmere
and
spoke
the
solemn
words
that
made
them
one
for
ever
the
first
news
he
heard
after
his
return
to
town
was
of
engagement
which
was
common
talk
at
the
clubs
the
visitors
at
rood
hall
had
come
back
to
london
full
of
the
event
and
were
proud
of
giving
a
detailed
account
of
the
affair
to
outsiders
they
all
talked
patronisingly
of
smithson
and
seemed
to
think
it
rather
a
wonderful
fact
that
he
did
not
drop
his
aspirates
or
eat
peas
with
a
knife
man
of
stirling
metal
said
the
gossips
can
hold
his
own
with
many
a
fellow
born
in
the
purple
maulevrier
called
in
arlington
street
but
lady
kirkbank
and
her
were
out
and
it
was
at
a
cricket
match
at
the
orleans
club
that
the
brother
and
sister
met
for
the
first
time
after
lord
hartfield
wedding
which
by
this
time
had
been
in
all
the
papers
a
very
simple
announcement
the
at
grasmere
by
the
reverend
douglass
brooke
the
earl
of
hartfield
to
mary
younger
daughter
of
the
ninth
earl
of
maulevrier
lesbia
was
the
centre
of
a
rather
noisy
little
court
in
which
smithson
was
conspicuous
by
his
superior
reserve
he
did
not
exert
himself
as
a
lover
paid
no
compliments
was
not
sentimental
the
pearl
was
won
and
he
wore
it
very
quietly
but
wherever
lesbia
went
he
went
she
was
hardly
ever
out
of
his
sight
maulevrier
received
the
coolest
possible
greeting
lesbia
turned
pale
with
anger
at
sight
of
him
for
his
presence
reminded
her
of
the
most
humiliating
passage
in
her
life
but
the
big
red
satin
sunshade
concealed
that
pale
angry
look
and
nothing
in
lesbia
manner
betrayed
emotion
have
you
been
hiding
yourself
all
this
time
and
why
were
you
not
at
henley
she
asked
have
been
at
grasmere
you
were
a
witness
of
that
most
romantic
marriage
the
lady
of
lyons
reversed
the
gardener
son
turning
out
to
be
an
earl
was
it
excruciatingly
funny
was
one
of
the
most
solemn
weddings
i
ever
saw
what
with
my
tomboy
sister
as
bride
impossible
sister
ceased
to
be
a
tomboy
when
she
fell
in
love
she
is
a
sweet
and
womanly
woman
and
will
make
an
adorable
wife
to
the
finest
fellow
i
know
i
hear
i
am
to
congratulate
you
lesbia
upon
your
engagement
with
mr
smithson
you
think
am
the
person
to
be
congratulated
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
my
engagement
is
a
fact
of
course
smithson
is
the
winner
but
as
i
hope
you
intend
to
be
happy
i
wish
you
joy
i
am
told
smithson
is
a
really
excellent
fellow
when
one
gets
to
know
him
and
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
be
better
acquainted
with
him
smithson
was
standing
just
out
of
hearing
watching
the
bowling
maulevrier
went
over
to
him
and
shook
hands
their
acquaintance
hitherto
having
been
of
the
slightest
and
very
shy
upon
his
lordship
part
but
now
smithson
could
see
that
maulevrier
meant
to
be
cordial

a

there
was
a
dinner
party
in
one
of
the
new
houses
in
grosvenor
place
that
evening
to
which
lady
kirkbank
and
lesbia
had
been
bidden
the
new
house
belonged
to
a
new
man
who
was
supposed
to
have
made
millions
out
of
railways
and
other
gigantic
achievements
in
the
engineering
line
and
the
new
man
and
his
wife
were
friends
of
smithson
and
had
made
the
simple
georgie
acquaintance
only
within
the
last
three
weeks
course
they
are
stupid
my
dear
she
remarked
in
response
to
some
slighting
remark
of
lesbia
i
am
always
willing
to
know
rich
people
one
drops
in
for
so
many
good
things
and
they
never
want
any
return
in
kind
it
is
quite
enough
for
them
to
be
allowed
to
spend
their
money
the
house
was
gorgeous
in
all
the
glory
of
the
very
latest
fashions
in
upholstery

the
dinner
was
as
magnificent
as
dinner
can
be
made
of
the
guests
were
the
of
the
financial
world
and
perspired
gold
the
other
third
belonged
to
a
class
which
smithson
described
somewhat
contemptuously
as
the
nobility
an
irish
peer
a
younger
son
of
a
ducal
house
that
had
run
to
seed
a
political
agitator
a
grass
widow
whose
titled
husband
was
governor
of
an
obscure
colony
an
ancient
dowager
with
hair
which
was
too
luxuriant
to
be
anything
but
a
wig
and
diamonds
which
were
so
large
as
to
suggest
paste
lesbia
sat
by
her
affianced
at
the
glittering
table
lighted
with
clusters
of
wax
candles
which
shone
upon
a
level
of
tea
roses
gardenias
and
gloire
de
malmaison
carnations
from
which
rose
at
intervals
groups
of
dolphins
supporting
shallow
golden
dishes
piled
with
peaches
grapes
and
all
the
costliest
produce
of
covent
garden
conversation
was
not
particularly
brilliant
nor
had
the
guests
an
elated
air
the
thermometer
was
near
eighty
and
at
this
period
of
the
season
everybody
was
tired
of
this
kind
of
dinner
and
would
gladly
have
foregone
the
greatest
achievements
of
culinary
art
in
favour
of
a
chicken
and
a
salad
eaten
under
green
leaves
in
a
garden
at
wargrave
or
henley
within
sound
of
the
rippling
river
on
lesbia
right
hand
there
was
a
portly
personage
of
jewish
type
dark
to
swarthiness
and
somewhat
oily
whose
every
word
suggested
bullion
he
and
smithson
were
evidently
acquaintances
of
long
standing
and
smithson
presented
him
to
lesbia
whereupon
he
joined
in
their
conversation
now
and
then
his
talk
was
of
the
usual
standard
he
had
seen
everything
worth
seeing
in
london
and
in
paris
between
which
cities
he
seemed
to
oscillate
with
such
frequency
that
he
might
be
said
to
live
in
both
places
at
once
he
had
his
stall
at
covent
garden
and
his
stall
at
the
grand
opera
he
was
a
subscriber
at
the
theatre
français
he
had
seen
all
the
races
at
longchamps
and
chantilly
as
well
as
at
sandown
and
ascot
but
every
now
and
then
he
and
smithson
drifted
from
the
customary
talk
about
operas
and
races
pictures
and
french
novels
to
the
wider
world
of
commerce
and
speculation
mines
waterworks
and
foreign
loans
and
lesbia
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
fanned
herself
languidly
with
eyelids
while
two
or
three
courses
went
round
she
giving
the
little
supercilious
look
at
each
offered
to
her
to
be
observed
on
such
occasions
as
if
the
thing
offered
were
particularly
nasty
she
wondered
how
long
the
two
men
were
going
to
prose
about
mines
and
shares
in
those
subdued
voices
telling
each
other
occult
facts
in
phrases
utterly
dark
to
the
outside
world
but
while
she
was
languidly
wondering
a
change
in
her
manner
startled
her
into
keenest
curiosity
is
in
paris
said
sampayo
the
dark
gentleman
dined
last
week
with
him
at
the
continental
smithson
complexion
faded
curiously
and
a
leaden
darkness
came
over
his
countenance
as
of
a
man
whose
heart
and
lungs
suddenly
refuse
their
office
but
in
a
few
moments
he
was
smiling
feebly
i
thought
he
was
played
out
years
ago
man
of
that
kind
is
never
played
out
don
gomez
de
montesma
is
as
clever
as
satan
as
handsome
as
apollo
and
he
bears
one
of
the
oldest
names
in
castile
such
a
man
will
always
come
to
the
front
un
rastaquouère
mais
rastaquouère
de
bon
you
knew
him
intimately
i
believe
cuba
yes
we
were
pretty
good
friends
once
were
useful
to
each
other
no
doubt
said
sampayo
pleasantly
that
argentiferous
copper
company
in
yours
or
his
were
a
good
many
people
concerned
in
it
doubt
it
takes
a
good
many
people
to
work
that
kind
of
thing
but
i
fancy
you
and
montesma
were
about
the
only
two
who
came
out
of
it
pleasantly
and
he
and
you
did
a
little
in
the
shipping
line
you
african
produce
however
that
an
old
song
you
have
had
so
many
good
things
since
then
montesma
talk
of
coming
to
london
did
not
talk
about
it
but
he
would
hardly
go
back
to
the
tropics
without
having
a
look
round
on
both
sides
of
the
channel
he
was
always
fond
of
society
pretty
women
dancing
and
amusements
of
all
kinds
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
see
him
here
before
the
end
of
the
season
smithson
pursued
the
subject
no
further
he
turned
to
lesbia
who
had
been
curiously
interested
in
this
little
bit
of
conversation
interested
first
because
smithson
had
seemed
agitated
by
the
mention
of
the
spaniard
name
secondly
because
of
the
description
of
the
man
which
had
a
romantic
sound
the
very
word
tropic
suggested
a
romance
and
lesbia
whose
mind
was
jaded
by
the
monotony
of
a
london
season
the
threadbare
fabric
of
society
conversation
kindled
at
any
image
which
appealed
to
her
fancy
clever
as
satan
handsome
as
apollo
scion
of
an
old
castilian
family
fresh
from
the
tropics
her
imagination
dwelt
upon
the
ideas
which
these
words
had
conjured
up
three
days
after
this
she
was
at
the
opera
with
her
chaperon
her
lover
in
attendance
as
usual
the
opera
was
faust
with
nillson
as
marguerite
after
the
performance
they
were
to
drive
down
to
twickenham
on
smithson
drag
and
to
dance
and
sup
at
the
orleans
the
last
ball
of
the
season
was
on
this
evening
and
lesbia
had
been
persuaded
that
it
was
to
be
a
particular
ball
and
that
only
the
very
nicest
people
were
to
be
present
at
any
rate
the
drive
under
the
light
of
a
july
moon
would
be
delicious
and
if
they
did
not
like
the
people
they
found
there
they
could
eat
their
supper
and
come
away
immediately
after
as
lady
kirkbank
remarked
philosophically
the
opera
was
nearly
over
that
grand
scene
of
valentine
death
was
on
and
lesbia
was
listening
breathlessly
to
every
note
watching
every
look
of
the
actors
when
there
came
a
modest
little
knock
at
the
door
of
her
box
she
darted
an
angry
glance
round
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
vexatiously
what
goth
had
dared
to
knock
during
that
thrilling
scene
smithson
rose
and
crept
to
the
door
and
quietly
opened
it
a
dark
handsome
man
who
was
a
total
stranger
to
lesbia
glided
in
shaking
hands
with
smithson
as
he
entered
till
this
moment
lesbia
whole
being
had
been
absorbed
in
the
scene
that
bitter
anathema
of
the
brother
the
sister
cry
of
anguish
and
shame
where
else
is
there
tragedy
so
human
so
enthralling
grief
that
so
wrings
the
spectator
heart
it
needed
a
goethe
and
a
gounod
to
produce
this
masterpiece
in
an
instant
in
a
flash
lesbia
interest
in
the
stage
was
gone
her
first
glance
at
the
stranger
told
her
who
he
was
the
olive
tint
the
eyes
of
deepest
black
the
grand
form
of
the
head
and
perfect
chiselling
of
the
features
could
belong
only
to
that
scion
of
an
old
castilian
race
whom
she
had
heard
described
the
other
evening
as
satan
handsome
as
apollo
yes
this
must
be
the
man
don
gomez
de
montesma
there
was
nothing
in
smithson
manner
to
indicate
that
the
spaniard
was
an
unwelcome
guest
on
the
contrary
smithson
received
him
with
a
cordiality
which
in
a
man
of
naturally
reserved
manner
seemed
almost
rapture
the
curtain
fell
and
he
presented
don
gomez
to
lady
kirkbank
and
lady
lesbia
whereupon
dear
georgie
began
to
gush
after
her
wont
and
to
ask
a
good
many
questions
in
a
manner
that
was
too
girlish
to
seem
impertinent
perfectly
you
speak
english
she
exclaimed
must
have
lived
in
england
a
good
deal
the
contrary
it
is
my
misfortune
to
have
lived
here
very
little
but
i
have
known
a
good
many
english
and
americans
in
cuba
and
in
paris
cuba
do
you
really
come
from
cuba
i
have
always
fancied
that
cuba
must
be
an
altogether
charming
place
to
live
in
like
biarritz
or
pau
do
you
know
only
further
away
do
please
tell
me
where
it
is
and
what
kind
of
a
place
geographically
lady
kirkbank
mind
was
a
blank
it
was
quite
a
revelation
to
her
to
find
that
cuba
was
an
island
must
be
a
lovely
spot
exclaimed
the
fervid
creature
me
see
now
what
do
we
get
from
cuba
cigars
and
and
tobacco
i
suppose
in
cuba
everybody
smokes
women
and
children
delicious
would
that
i
were
a
cuban
and
the
natives
are
they
nice
are
no
aborigines
the
indians
whom
columbus
found
soon
perished
off
the
face
of
the
island
european
civilisation
generally
has
that
effect
but
one
of
our
most
benevolent
provided
us
with
an
imported
population
of
niggers
delightful
i
have
always
longed
to
live
among
a
slave
population
dear
submissive
black
things
dressed
in
coral
necklaces
and
feathers
instead
of
the
horrid
wretches
we
have
to
wait
upon
us
and
if
the
aborigines
were
not
wanted
it
was
just
as
well
for
them
to
die
out
do
you
know
prattled
lady
kirkbank
was
very
accommodating
of
them
no
doubt
yet
we
could
employ
half
a
million
of
them
if
we
had
them
in
draining
our
swamps
agriculture
suffered
by
the
loss
of
indian
labour
suppose
they
were
like
the
creatures
in
pizarro
poor
dear
yellow
things
with
brass
bracelets
said
lady
kirkbank
remember
seeing
macready
as
rolla
when
i
was
quite
a
little
thing
and
now
the
curtain
rose
for
the
last
act
you
care
about
staying
for
the
end
asked
smithson
of
lesbia
will
make
us
rather
late
at
the
orleans
mind
how
late
we
are
said
lesbia
imperiously
have
always
been
cheated
out
of
this
last
act
for
some
stupid
party
imagine
losing
gounod
and
nillson
for
the
sake
of
struggling
through
the
mob
on
a
stifling
staircase
and
being
elbowed
by
inane
young
men
with
gardenias
in
their
coats
lady
lesbia
had
a
pretty
little
way
of
always
opposing
any
suggestion
of
her
sweetheart
she
was
resolved
to
treat
him
as
badly
as
a
future
husband
could
be
treated
in
consenting
to
marry
him
she
had
done
him
a
favour
which
was
a
great
deal
more
than
such
a
person
had
any
right
to
expect
she
leant
forward
to
watch
and
listen
with
her
elbow
resting
on
the
velvet
cushion
her
head
upon
her
hand
and
she
seemed
absorbed
in
the
scene
but
this
was
mere
outward
seeming
all
the
enchantment
of
music
and
acting
was
over
she
only
heard
and
saw
vaguely
as
if
it
were
a
shadowy
scene
enacted
ever
so
far
away
every
now
and
then
her
eyes
glanced
involuntarily
toward
don
gomez
who
stood
leaning
against
the
back
of
the
box
pale
languid
graceful
poetic
an
altogether
different
type
of
manhood
from
that
with
which
she
had
of
late
been
satiated
those
deep
dark
eyes
of
his
had
a
dreamy
look
they
gazed
across
the
dazzling
house
into
space
above
lady
lesbia
head
they
seemed
to
see
nothing
and
they
certainly
were
not
looking
at
her
don
gomez
was
the
first
man
she
ever
remembered
to
have
been
presented
to
her
who
did
not
favour
her
with
a
good
deal
of
hard
staring
more
or
less
discreetly
managed
during
the
first
ten
minutes
of
their
acquaintance
on
him
her
beauty
fell
flat
he
evidently
failed
to
recognise
her
supreme
loveliness
it
might
be
that
she
was
the
wrong
type
for
cuba
every
nation
has
its
own
venus
and
that
far
away
spot
beyond
the
torrid
zone
might
have
a
somewhat
barbarous
idea
of
beauty
at
any
rate
don
gomez
was
apparently
unimpressed
and
yet
lesbia
flattered
herself
that
she
was
looking
her
best
and
that
her
costume
was
a
success
she
wore
a
white
satin
gown
short
in
the
skirt
for
the
luxury
of
freedom
in
waltzing
and
made
with
simplicity
the
bodice
high
to
the
throat
fitting
her
like
a
sheath
her
only
ornaments
were
a
garland
of
scarlet
poppies
wreathed
from
throat
to
shoulder
and
a
large
diamond
heart
which
smithson
had
lately
given
her
bullock
heart
as
lady
kirkbank
called
it
when
the
curtain
fell
and
not
till
then
she
rose
and
allowed
herself
to
be
clad
in
a
brown
velvet
newmarket
which
completely
covered
her
short
satin
gown
she
had
a
little
brown
velvet
toque
to
match
the
newmarket
and
thus
attired
she
would
be
able
to
take
her
seat
on
the
drag
which
was
waiting
on
the
quietest
side
of
covent
garden
should
not
you
go
with
us
don
gomez
exclaimed
lady
kirkbank
in
a
gush
of
hospitality
drive
will
be
charming
not
equal
to
your
tropical
cuba
but
intensely
nice
and
the
gardens
will
be
something
too
sweet
on
such
a
night
as
this
i
knew
them
when
the
dear
duc
was
there
ay
de
mi
such
a
man
lady
kirkbank
sighed
with
the
air
of
having
known
his
altesse
royale
intimately
should
be
charmed
said
don
gomez
i
thought
my
friend
smithson
wanted
me
would
you
really
like
to
have
me
smithson
should
be
enchanted
there
is
room
on
the
drag
enough
for
i
am
only
taking
sir
george
kirkbank
and
colonel
delville
whom
we
are
to
pick
up
at
the
haute
gomme
and
and
mostyn
who
are
in
the
stalls
nice
snug
little
party
exclaimed
that
charming
optimist
lady
kirkbank
hate
a
crowd
on
a
drag
the
way
some
of
the
members
of
the
club
load
their
coaches
on
parade
reminds
me
of
a
beanfeast
they
found
lady
kirkbank
footman
and
one
of
smithson
grooms
waiting
in
the
hall
of
the
opera
house
the
groom
to
conduct
them
to
the
spot
where
the
drag
was
waiting
the
footman
to
carry
wraps
and
take
his
mistress
final
orders
there
was
a
bohemian
flavour
in
the
little
walk
to
the
great
fruit
garden
which
was
odorous
of
bruised
peaches
and
stale
salads
as
they
passed
it
of
cabbages
and
other
garden
stuff
were
standing
about
by
the
old
church
the
roadway
was
littered
with
the
refuse
of
the
market
and
the
air
was
faint
and
heavy
with
the
scent
of
herbs
and
flowers
lesbia
mounted
lightly
to
her
place
of
honour
on
the
and
lady
kirkbank
was
hoisted
up
after
her
and
mostyn
followed
and
then
don
gomez
took
his
seat
by
lady
kirkbank
side
and
behind
lesbia
a
vantage
point
from
which
he
could
talk
to
her
as
much
as
he
liked
smithson
seated
himself
a
minute
afterwards
and
drove
off
by
king
street
and
leicester
square
and
on
to
piccadilly
steering
cleverly
through
the
traffic
of
cabs
and
carriages
which
was
at
its
apogee
just
now
when
all
the
theatres
were
disgorging
their
crowds
piccadilly
was
quieter
yet
there
were
plenty
of
carriages
late
people
going
to
parties
and
early
people
going
home
horses
slipping
and
sliding
on
stones
or
wood
half
the
roadway
up
and
luminous
with
lanterns
they
stopped
in
front
of
the
haute
gomme
where
they
picked
up
sir
george
kirkbank
and
colonel
delville
a
big
man
with
a
patriarchal
head
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
finest
whist
players
in
london
and
to
make
a
handsome
income
by
his
play
he
had
ridden
in
the
balaclava
charge
was
a
favourite
everywhere
and
albeit
no
genius
was
much
cleverer
than
his
friend
and
george
kirkbank
they
had
been
at
eton
together
had
both
made
love
to
the
lively
georgie
and
had
been
inseparables
for
the
last
thirty
years
get
on
without
delville
said
sir
george
smart
fellow
sir
knows
the
ropes
and
does
all
the
thinking
for
both
of
us
and
now
they
were
fairly
started
and
the
team
fell
into
a
rattling
pace
with
the
road
pretty
clear
before
them
hyde
park
was
one
umbrageous
darkness
edged
by
long
lines
of
golden
light
coolness
and
silence
enfolded
all
things
in
the
summer
midnight
and
lesbia
not
prone
to
romance
sank
into
a
dreamy
state
of
mind
as
she
leaned
back
in
her
seat
and
watched
the
shadowy
trees
glide
by
the
long
vista
of
lamps
and
verdure
in
front
of
her
she
was
glad
that
no
one
talked
to
her
for
talk
of
any
kind
must
have
broken
the
spell
don
gomez
sat
like
a
statue
in
his
place
behind
her
from
lady
kirkbank
the
loquacious
came
a
gentle
sound
of
snoring
a
subdued
ladylike
snore
breathed
softly
at
intervals
like
a
sigh
smithson
had
his
team
and
his
own
thoughts
too
for
occupation
thoughts
which
were
not
altogether
pleasant
at
the
back
of
the
coach
mostyn
was
descanting
on
the
evolution
of
the
nautilus
and
the
relationship
of
protoplasm
and
humanity
to
colonel
delville
who
sat
smiling
placidly
behind
an
immense
cigar
and
accepted
the
most
stupendous
facts
and
the
most
appalling
theories
with
a
friendly
little
nod
of
his
handsome
head
mostyn
frankly
slept
as
it
was
his
custom
to
do
upon
all
convenient
occasions
he
called
it
recuperating
ought
to
be
delightfully
fresh
for
he
recuperated
all
the
way
down
said
his
wife
when
they
alighted
in
the
dewy
garden
at
twickenham
in
front
of
the
portico
would
have
minded
his
recuperating
if
he
had
snored
so
abominably
remarked
colonel
delville
it
was
nearly
one
and
the
ball
had
thinned
a
little
which
made
it
all
the
better
for
those
who
remained
smithson
orders
had
been
given
two
days
ago
and
the
very
best
of
the
waiters
had
been
told
off
for
his
especial
service
the
ladies
went
upstairs
to
take
off
their
wrappings
and
mufflings
and
lesbia
emerged
dazzling
from
her
brown
velvet
newmarket
while
lady
kirkbank
bending
closely
over
the
like
a
witch
over
a
caldron
repaired
her
complexion
with
cotton
wool
they
went
through
the
conservatory
to
the
octagon
where
the
supper
was
ready
a
special
supper
on
a
table
by
a
window
a
table
laden
with
exotics
and
brilliant
with
glass
and
silver
the
supper
was
of
course
perfect
in
its
way
smithson
had
been
down
to
see
about
it
and
smithson
own
particular
champagne
and
the
claret
grown
in
his
own
particular
in
the
gironde
had
been
sent
down
for
the
feast
no
common
cuisine
no
common
wine
could
be
good
enough
and
yet
there
was
a
day
when
the
cheapest
gargote
in
belleville
or
montmartre
was
good
enough
for
smithson
there
had
been
days
on
which
he
did
not
dine
at
all
and
when
the
fumes
of
a
steaming
from
a
workman
restaurant
made
his
mouth
water
the
supper
was
all
life
and
gaiety
everyone
was
hungry
and
thirsty
and
freshened
by
the
drive
except
lesbia
she
was
singularly
silent
ate
hardly
anything
but
drank
three
or
four
glasses
of
champagne
don
gomez
was
not
a
great
talker
he
had
the
air
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
who
expects
other
people
to
talk
and
to
keep
him
amused
but
the
little
he
said
was
to
the
point
he
had
a
fine
baritone
very
low
and
subdued
and
had
a
languor
which
was
almost
insolent
but
not
without
its
charm
there
was
an
air
of
originality
about
the
manner
and
the
man
he
was
the
typical
a
man
of
finished
manners
and
unknown
antecedents
a
foreigner
apparently
rich
obviously
accomplished
but
with
that
indefinable
air
which
bespeaks
the
adventurer
and
which
gives
society
as
fair
a
warning
as
if
the
man
wore
a
placard
on
his
shoulder
with
the
word
but
to
lesbia
this
spaniard
was
the
first
really
interesting
man
she
had
met
since
she
saw
john
hammond
and
her
interest
in
him
was
much
more
vivid
than
her
interest
in
hammond
had
been
at
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
that
pale
face
with
its
tint
of
old
ivory
those
thin
lips
indicative
of
diabolical
craft
could
she
but
read
aright
those
unfathomable
eyes
touched
her
fancy
as
it
had
never
yet
been
touched
awoke
within
her
that
latent
vein
of
romance
supreme
foolishness
which
lurks
in
the
nature
of
every
woman
be
she
chaste
as
ice
and
pure
as
snow
the
supper
was
long
it
was
past
two
and
the
ballroom
was
thinly
occupied
when
smithson
party
went
there
wo
dance
i
suppose
said
smithson
as
lesbia
and
he
went
slowly
down
the
room
arm
in
arm
it
was
in
a
pause
between
two
waltzes
the
wide
window
at
the
end
was
opened
to
the
summer
night
and
the
room
was
delightfully
cool
must
be
horribly
tired
am
not
in
the
least
tired
and
i
mean
to
waltz
if
anyone
will
ask
me
replied
lesbia
decisively
ought
to
have
asked
you
to
dance
and
then
it
would
have
been
the
other
way
said
smithson
with
a
touch
of
acrimony
you
have
dancing
enough
in
town
and
you
might
be
obliging
for
once
in
a
way
and
come
and
sit
with
me
in
the
garden
and
listen
to
the
nightingales
are
no
nightingales
after
june
there
is
the
manola
as
the
band
struck
up
very
favourite
waltz
don
gomez
was
at
her
elbow
at
this
moment
i
have
the
honour
of
this
waltz
with
you
lady
lesbia
he
asked
and
then
with
a
glance
at
his
stoutish
friend
think
smithson
waltzes
have
been
told
that
nobody
can
waltz
who
has
been
born
on
this
side
of
the
pyrenees
answered
lesbia
withdrawing
her
arm
from
her
lover
and
slipping
it
through
the
spaniard
with
the
air
of
a
slave
who
obeys
a
master
smithson
looked
daggers
and
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
room
glowering
were
a
man
times
millionaire
like
the
parisian
rothschild
he
could
not
find
armour
against
the
poisoned
arrows
of
jealousy
don
gomez
possessed
many
of
those
accomplishments
which
make
men
dangerous
but
as
a
dancer
he
was
and
horace
smithson
knew
that
there
is
no
surer
road
to
a
girl
fancy
than
the
magic
circle
of
a
waltz
those
two
were
floating
round
the
room
in
the
old
slow
legato
step
which
recalled
to
smithson
the
picture
of
a
still
more
spacious
room
in
an
island
under
the
southern
cross
the
blue
water
of
the
bay
shining
yonder
under
the
starlight
of
the
tropics
gleaming
and
flashing
in
the
foliage
beyond
the
open
windows
flashing
amidst
the
gauzy
draperies
of
the
dancers
and
this
same
gomez
revolving
with
the
same
slow
languid
grace
his
arm
encircling
the
figure
of
a
woman
whose
southern
beauty
outshone
lesbia
blonde
english
loveliness
as
the
tropical
stars
outshine
the
lamps
that
light
our
colder
skies
yes
every
detail
of
the
scene
flashed
back
into
his
mind
as
if
a
curtain
had
been
suddenly
plucked
back
from
a
picture
the
cuban
tall
slim
figure
the
head
gently
bent
towards
his
partner
head
as
at
this
moment
and
those
dark
eyes
looking
up
at
him
intoxicated
with
that
nameless
indefinable
fascination
which
it
is
the
lot
of
some
men
to
exercise
robbed
me
of
thought
smithson
gloomily
he
rob
me
of
this
one
too
surely
not
havana
is
havana
and
this
one
is
not
a
creole
if
i
can
not
trust
that
lovely
piece
of
marble
there
is
no
woman
on
earth
to
be
trusted
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
dancers
and
went
out
into
the
garden
his
soul
was
wrung
with
jealousy
yet
he
could
watch
no
longer
there
was
too
much
pain
there
were
too
many
bitter
memories
of
shame
and
loss
and
ignominy
evoked
by
that
infernal
picture
if
he
had
been
free
he
would
have
asserted
his
authority
as
lesbia
future
husband
he
would
have
taken
her
away
from
the
orleans
he
would
have
told
her
plainly
and
frankly
that
don
gomez
was
no
fit
person
for
her
to
know
and
he
would
have
so
planned
that
they
two
should
never
meet
again
but
horace
smithson
was
not
free
he
was
bound
hand
and
foot
by
those
fetters
which
the
chain
of
past
events
had
forged
stern
facts
which
the
man
himself
may
forget
or
try
to
forget
but
which
other
people
never
forget
there
is
generally
some
dark
spot
in
the
history
of
such
men
as
smithson
men
who
climb
the
giddiest
heights
of
this
world
with
that
desperate
rapidity
which
implies
many
a
perilous
leap
from
crag
to
crag
many
a
moraine
skimmed
over
and
many
an
awful
gulf
spanned
by
a
bridge
smithson
history
was
not
without
such
spots
and
the
darkest
of
all
had
relation
to
his
career
in
cuba
the
story
had
been
known
by
very
few
perhaps
completely
known
only
by
one
man
and
that
man
was
gomez
de
montesma
for
the
last
fifteen
years
the
most
fervent
desire
of
horace
heart
had
been
the
hope
that
tropical
nature
in
any
one
of
her
various
disagreeable
forms
would
be
obliging
enough
to
make
an
end
of
gomez
but
the
forces
of
nature
had
not
worked
on
smithson
side
no
loathsome
leprosy
had
eaten
his
enemy
flesh
neither
cayman
nor
crocodile
neither
juba
snake
nor
poisonous
spider
had
marked
him
for
its
prey
the
tropical
sun
had
left
him
unsmitten
he
had
lived
and
he
had
prospered
and
he
was
here
like
a
guilty
conscience
incarnate
to
spoil
horace
smithson
peace
must
be
diplomatic
smithson
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
up
and
down
an
avenue
of
irish
yews
in
a
solitary
part
of
the
grounds
smoking
his
cigarette
and
hearing
the
music
swell
and
sink
in
the
distance
will
give
her
a
hint
as
to
that
man
character
and
i
will
keep
them
apart
as
much
as
i
can
but
if
he
forces
himself
upon
me
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
can
not
afford
to
be
uncivil
to
him
can
not
afford
in
this
instance
meant
not
and
horace
thoughts
as
he
paced
the
walk
were
full
of
gloom
during
that
long
meditation
he
made
up
his
mind
on
one
point
namely
that
let
him
suffer
what
pangs
he
might
he
must
not
betray
his
jealousy
to
do
that
would
be
to
lower
himself
in
lesbia
eyes
and
to
play
into
his
rival
hand
for
a
jealous
man
is
almost
always
contemptible
in
the
sight
of
his
mistress
he
would
carry
himself
as
if
he
were
sure
of
her
fidelity
and
this
very
confidence
with
a
woman
of
honour
a
girl
reared
as
lesbia
had
been
reared
would
render
it
impossible
for
her
to
betray
him
he
would
show
himself
confident
generous
chivalrous
even
and
he
would
trust
to
chance
for
the
issue
chance
was
smithson
only
idea
of
divinity
and
chance
had
hitherto
been
kind
to
him
there
had
been
dark
hours
in
his
life
but
the
darkness
had
not
lasted
long
and
the
lucky
accidents
of
his
career
had
been
of
a
nature
to
beguile
him
into
the
belief
that
among
the
favourites
of
destiny
he
stood
first
and
foremost
while
smithson
mused
thus
alone
and
in
the
darkness
montesma
and
lady
lesbia
were
wandering
arm
in
arm
in
another
and
lovelier
part
of
the
grounds
where
golden
lights
were
scattered
like
cuban
among
the
foliage
of
seringa
and
magnolia
arbutus
and
rhododendron
while
at
intervals
a
sudden
flush
of
rosier
light
was
shed
over
garden
and
river
as
if
by
enchantment
surprising
a
couple
here
and
there
in
the
midst
of
a
flirtation
which
had
begun
in
darkness
the
grounds
were
lovely
in
the
balmy
atmosphere
of
a
july
night
the
river
gliding
with
mysterious
motion
under
the
stars
great
masses
of
gloom
darkening
the
stream
with
an
almost
awful
look
where
the
woods
of
petersham
and
ham
house
cast
their
dense
shadows
on
the
water
don
gomez
and
his
companion
wandered
by
the
river
side
to
a
spot
where
a
group
of
magnolias
sheltered
them
from
the
open
lawn
and
where
there
were
some
rustic
chairs
close
to
the
balustrade
which
protected
the
parapet
in
this
spot
which
was
a
kind
of
island
divided
from
the
rest
of
the
grounds
by
the
intervening
road
they
found
themselves
quite
alone
and
in
the
midst
of
a
summer
stillness
which
was
broken
only
by
the
low
lazy
ripple
of
the
tide
running
seawards
the
lights
of
richmond
looked
far
away
and
the
little
town
with
its
variety
of
levels
had
an
italian
air
in
the
distance
from
the
ballroom
faint
and
fitful
came
the
music
of
a
waltz
afraid
i
brought
you
too
far
said
don
gomez
the
contrary
it
is
a
relief
to
get
away
from
the
lights
and
the
people
how
delicious
this
river
is
i
was
brought
up
on
the
shores
of
a
lake
but
after
all
a
lake
is
horribly
tame
its
limits
are
always
staring
one
in
the
face
there
is
no
room
for
one
imagination
to
wander
now
a
river
like
this
suggests
an
infinity
of
possibilities
drifting
on
and
on
and
on
into
undiscovered
regions
by
shores
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
step
into
that
little
boat
yonder
pointing
to
a
light
skiff
bobbing
gently
up
and
down
with
the
tide
at
the
bottom
of
a
flight
of
steps
let
the
stream
take
me
wherever
it
chose
i
could
but
go
with
you
said
gomez
in
that
deep
and
musical
tone
which
made
the
commonest
words
seem
melody
would
ask
for
neither
compass
nor
rudder
what
could
it
matter
whither
the
boat
took
me
there
is
no
place
under
the
stars
which
would
not
be
a
paradise
with
you
do
make
a
dreamy
aspiration
the
occasion
for
a
compliment
exclaimed
lesbia
lightly
i
said
was
so
silly
that
i
do
wonder
you
thought
it
right
to
say
something
just
a
little
sillier
but
moonlight
and
running
water
have
a
curious
effect
upon
me
and
i
who
am
the
most
prosaic
among
women
become
ridiculously
sentimental
can
not
believe
that
you
are
prosaic
assure
you
it
is
perfectly
true
i
am
of
the
earth
earthy
a
woman
of
the
world
in
my
first
season
ambitious
fond
of
pleasure
vain
proud
exacting
all
those
things
which
i
am
told
a
woman
ought
not
to
be
pain
me
when
you
so
slander
yourself
and
i
shall
make
it
the
business
of
my
life
to
find
out
how
much
truth
there
is
in
that
for
my
own
part
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
but
as
it
is
rude
to
contradict
a
lady
i
will
only
say
that
i
reserve
my
opinion
you
to
stay
long
in
england
asked
lesbia
she
was
leaning
against
the
stone
balustrade
in
a
careless
attitude
as
of
one
who
was
weary
her
elbow
on
the
stone
slab
and
her
head
thrown
back
against
her
arm
the
white
satin
gown
moulded
to
her
figure
had
a
statuesque
air
and
she
looked
like
a
marble
statue
in
the
dim
light
every
line
of
the
graceful
form
expressive
of
repose
will
depend
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
london
a
very
little
of
your
english
babylon
satisfies
me
in
a
general
way
but
there
are
conditions
which
might
make
england
enchanting
where
do
you
go
at
the
end
of
the
season
to
goodwood
and
then
to
cowes
smithson
is
so
kind
as
to
place
his
yacht
at
lady
kirkbank
disposal
and
i
am
to
be
her
guest
on
board
the
cayman
just
as
i
am
in
arlington
street
cayman
that
name
is
a
reminiscence
of
smithson
south
american
travels
doubt
was
he
long
in
south
america
or
four
years
not
in
cuba
all
that
time
i
suppose
had
business
relations
with
cuba
all
that
time
and
oscillated
between
our
island
and
the
main
he
was
rather
fortunate
in
his
little
adventures
with
us
made
almost
as
much
money
as
general
tacon
of
blessed
memory
but
i
dare
say
smithson
has
told
you
all
his
adventures
in
that
part
of
the
world
he
very
rarely
talks
about
his
travels
and
i
am
not
particularly
interested
in
commercial
speculations
there
is
always
so
much
to
think
of
and
talk
about
in
the
business
of
the
moment
are
you
fond
of
cuba
passionately
i
always
feel
as
if
i
were
an
exile
there
and
yet
one
of
my
ancestors
was
with
columbus
when
he
discovered
the
island
and
my
race
were
among
the
earliest
settlers
my
family
has
given
three
to
cuba
but
i
can
not
forget
that
i
belong
to
an
older
world
and
have
forfeited
that
which
ought
to
have
been
a
brilliant
place
in
europe
for
the
luxurious
obscurity
of
a
colony
you
must
be
attached
to
a
place
in
which
your
family
have
lived
for
so
many
generations
like
the
stars
and
the
sea
the
mountains
and
savannas
the
tropical
vegetation
and
the
dreamy
life
but
at
best
it
is
a
kind
of
stagnation
and
after
a
residence
of
a
few
months
in
the
island
of
my
birth
i
generally
spread
my
wings
for
the
wider
world
of
the
old
continent
or
the
new
must
have
travelled
so
much
said
lesbia
with
a
sigh
have
been
nowhere
and
seen
nothing
i
feel
like
a
child
who
has
been
shut
up
in
a
nursery
all
its
life
and
knows
of
no
world
beyond
four
walls
to
travel
is
not
to
live
said
don
gomez
am
to
be
in
italy
next
november
i
believe
said
lesbia
not
caring
to
own
that
this
italian
trip
was
to
be
her
honeymoon
exclaimed
the
spaniard
contemptuously
the
finishing
school
of
the
english
nobility
now
the
happy
of
the
cockney
tourist
and
the
prosperous
yankee
all
the
poetry
of
italy
has
been
dried
up
and
the
whole
country
vulgarised
if
you
want
romance
in
the
old
world
go
to
spain
in
the
new
try
peru
or
brazil
mexico
or
california
am
afraid
i
am
not
adventurous
enough
to
go
so
far
women
cling
to
beaten
tracks
obey
our
masters
answered
lesbia
meekly
i
forgot
you
are
to
have
a
master
and
soon
i
heard
as
much
before
i
saw
you
lesbia
half
rose
as
if
to
leave
this
cool
retreat
above
the
rippling
tide
it
is
all
settled
she
said
now
i
think
i
must
go
back
lady
kirkbank
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
me
her
wonder
a
little
longer
said
don
gomez
should
we
hurry
away
from
this
delightful
spot
why
break
the
spell
of
the
river
life
has
so
few
moments
of
perfect
contentment
if
this
is
one
with
you
as
it
is
with
me
let
us
make
the
most
of
it
lady
lesbia
do
you
see
those
weeds
yonder
drifting
with
the
tide
drifting
side
by
side
touching
as
they
drift
they
have
met
heaven
knows
how
and
will
part
heaven
knows
where
on
their
way
to
the
sea
but
they
let
themselves
go
with
the
tide
we
have
met
like
those
poor
weeds
do
let
us
part
till
the
tide
parts
us
lesbia
gave
a
little
sigh
and
submitted
she
had
talked
of
women
obeying
their
masters
and
the
implication
was
that
she
meant
to
obey
smithson
but
there
is
a
fate
in
these
things
and
the
man
who
was
to
be
her
master
whose
lightest
breath
was
to
sway
her
whose
lightest
look
was
to
rule
her
was
here
at
her
side
in
the
silence
of
the
summer
night
they
talked
long
but
of
indifferent
subjects
and
their
talk
might
have
been
heard
by
every
member
of
the
orleans
club
and
no
harm
done
yet
words
and
phrases
count
for
very
little
in
such
a
case
it
is
the
tone
it
is
the
melody
of
a
voice
it
is
the
magic
of
the
hour
that
tells
the
tide
came
in
the
person
of
smithson
and
parted
these
two
weeds
that
were
drifting
towards
the
great
mysterious
ocean
of
fate
have
been
hunting
for
you
everywhere
he
said
cheerfully
you
want
another
waltz
lady
lesbia
you
had
better
take
the
next
i
believe
it
is
to
be
the
last
at
any
rate
our
party
are
clamouring
to
be
driven
home
i
found
poor
lady
kirkbank
fast
asleep
in
a
corner
of
the
you
give
me
that
last
waltz
asked
don
gomez
lady
lesbia
felt
that
the
smithson
had
endured
enough
womanly
instinct
constrained
her
to
refuse
that
final
waltz
but
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
making
a
tremendous
sacrifice
in
so
doing
and
yet
she
had
waltzed
to
her
heart
content
during
the
season
that
was
waning
and
knew
all
the
waltzes
played
by
all
the
fashionable
bands
she
gave
a
little
sigh
as
she
said
i
must
not
indulge
myself
i
must
go
and
take
care
of
lady
kirkbank
smithson
offered
his
arm
and
she
took
it
and
went
away
with
him
leaving
don
gomez
to
follow
at
his
leisure
there
would
be
some
delay
no
doubt
before
the
drag
started
the
lamps
had
gone
out
among
the
foliage
and
the
stars
were
waning
a
little
and
there
was
a
faint
cold
light
creeping
over
the
garden
which
meant
the
advent
of
morning
don
gomez
strolled
towards
the
lighted
house
smoking
a
cigarette
is
very
lovely
and
she
is
well
not
quite
spoiled
by
her
and
they
tell
me
she
is
an
heiress
sure
to
inherit
a
fine
fortune
from
some
ancient
grandmother
buried
alive
in
westmoreland
he
mused
a
splendid
opportunity
it
would
be
if
if
the
business
could
be
arranged
on
the
square
but
as
it
is
well
as
it
is
there
is
the
chance
of
an
adventure
and
when
did
a
montesma
ever
avoid
an
adventure
although
there
were
dagger
or
poison
lurking
in
the
background
and
here
there
is
neither
poison
nor
steel
only
a
lovely
woman
and
an
infatuated
stockbroker
about
whom
i
know
enough
to
disgrace
and
ruin
an
archbishop
poor
smithson
how
very
unlucky
that
i
should
happen
to
come
across
your
pathway
in
the
heyday
of
your
latest
love
affair
we
have
had
our
little
adventures
in
that
line
already
and
we
have
measured
swords
together
metaphorically
before
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
actual
swords
my
smithson

chapter

lord
hartfield
refuses
a
fortune
a
honeymoon
among
lakes
and
mountains
amidst
the
gorgeous
confusion
of
borrowdale
in
a
little
world
of
wild
strange
loveliness
shut
in
and
isolated
from
the
prosaic
outer
world
by
the
vast
and
towering
masses
of
skiddaw
and
blencathara
a
world
of
one
own
as
it
were
a
world
steeped
in
romance
and
poetry
dear
to
the
souls
of
poets
there
are
many
such
honeymoons
every
summer
indeed
the
mountain
paths
the
waterfalls
and
lakes
swarm
with
happy
lovers
and
this
land
of
hills
and
waters
seems
to
have
been
made
expressly
for
honeymoon
travellers
yet
never
went
truer
lovers
wandering
by
lake
and
torrent
by
hill
and
valley
than
those
two
whose
brief
honeymoon
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
it
was
altogether
a
magical
time
for
mary
this
dawn
of
a
new
life
the
immensity
of
her
happiness
almost
frightened
her
she
could
hardly
believe
in
it
or
trust
in
its
continuance
i
really
really
really
your
wife
she
asked
on
their
last
day
bending
down
to
speak
to
her
husband
as
he
led
her
pony
up
the
rough
ways
of
skiddaw
is
all
so
dreadfully
like
a
dream
god
it
is
the
very
truth
answered
lord
hartfield
looking
fondly
at
the
fresh
young
face
brightened
by
the
summer
wind
which
faintly
stirred
the
auburn
hair
under
the
neat
little
hat
am
i
actually
a
countess
i
do
care
about
it
one
little
bit
you
know
except
as
a
stupendous
joke
if
you
were
to
tell
me
that
you
had
been
only
making
fun
of
poor
grandmother
and
me
and
that
those
diamonds
are
glass
and
you
only
plain
john
hammond
it
would
make
the
faintest
difference
indeed
it
would
be
a
weight
off
my
mind
it
is
an
awfully
oppressive
thing
to
be
a
countess
sorry
i
can
not
relieve
you
of
the
burden
the
law
of
the
land
has
made
you
lady
hartfield
and
i
hope
you
are
preparing
your
mind
for
the
duties
of
your
position
is
very
dreadful
sighed
mary
her
ladyship
were
as
well
and
as
active
as
she
was
when
first
you
came
to
fellside
she
could
have
helped
me
but
now
there
will
be
no
one
except
you
and
you
will
help
me
wo
you
jack
all
my
heart
own
true
jack
with
a
little
fervent
squeeze
of
his
sunburnt
hand
society
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
call
you
hartfield
hartfield
please
ring
the
bell
give
me
a
footstool
hartfield
how
odd
it
sounds
i
shall
be
blurting
out
the
old
dear
name
do
think
it
will
much
matter
it
will
pass
for
one
of
lady
hartfield
little
ways
every
woman
is
supposed
to
have
little
ways
do
you
know
one
has
a
little
way
of
dropping
her
friends
another
has
a
little
way
of
not
paying
her
dressmaker
another
little
way
is
to
take
too
much
champagne
i
hope
lady
hartfield
little
way
will
be
her
devotion
to
her
husband
afraid
i
shall
end
by
being
a
nuisance
to
you
for
i
shall
love
you
ridiculously
answered
mary
gaily
from
what
you
have
told
me
about
society
it
seems
to
me
that
there
can
be
nothing
so
unfashionable
as
an
affectionate
wife
will
you
mind
my
being
quite
out
of
fashion
jack
should
very
much
object
to
your
being
in
the
fashion
i
am
happy
i
do
think
it
is
in
my
nature
to
become
a
woman
of
fashion
although
i
have
cured
myself
for
your
sake
of
being
a
hoyden
i
had
so
schooled
myself
for
what
i
thought
our
new
life
was
to
be
so
trained
myself
to
be
a
managing
economical
wife
that
i
feel
quite
at
sea
now
that
i
am
to
be
mistress
of
a
house
in
grosvenor
square
and
a
place
in
kent
still
i
will
bear
with
it
all
yes
even
endure
the
weight
of
those
diamonds
for
your
sake
she
laughed
and
he
laughed
they
were
quite
alone
among
the
hills
hardy
mountaineers
both
and
they
could
be
as
foolish
as
they
liked
she
rested
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
he
and
she
and
the
pony
made
one
as
they
climbed
the
hill
close
together
last
day
sighed
mary
as
they
went
down
again
after
a
couple
of
blissful
hours
in
that
wild
world
between
earth
and
sky
shall
be
glad
to
go
back
to
poor
grandmother
who
must
be
sadly
lonely
but
it
is
so
sweet
to
be
quite
alone
with
you
they
left
the
lodore
hotel
in
an
open
carriage
after
luncheon
next
day
and
posted
to
fellside
where
they
arrived
just
in
time
to
assist
at
lady
maulevrier
afternoon
tea
she
received
them
both
with
warm
affection
and
made
hartfield
sit
close
beside
her
sofa
and
every
now
and
then
in
the
pauses
of
their
talk
she
laid
her
wasted
and
too
delicate
fingers
upon
the
young
man
strong
brown
hand
with
a
caressing
gesture
can
never
know
how
sweet
it
is
to
me
to
be
able
to
love
you
she
said
tenderly
can
never
know
how
my
heart
yearned
to
you
from
the
very
first
and
how
hard
it
was
to
keep
myself
in
check
and
not
be
too
kind
to
you
oh
hartfield
you
should
have
told
me
the
truth
you
should
not
have
come
here
under
false
colours
i
not
lady
maulevrier
it
was
my
only
chance
of
being
loved
for
my
own
sake
or
at
least
of
knowing
that
i
was
so
loved
if
i
had
come
with
my
rank
and
my
fortune
in
my
hand
as
it
were
one
of
the
good
matches
of
the
year
what
security
could
i
ever
have
felt
in
the
disinterested
love
of
the
girl
who
chose
me
as
plain
john
hammond
i
wooed
and
was
rejected
as
plain
john
hammond
i
wooed
and
won
and
the
prize
which
i
so
won
is
a
pearl
above
price
not
for
worlds
were
the
last
year
to
be
lived
over
again
would
i
have
one
day
of
my
life
altered
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
satisfied
i
wanted
you
for
lesbia
and
i
have
got
you
for
mary
best
of
all
i
have
got
you
for
myself
ronald
hollister
son
is
mine
he
is
of
my
kin
he
belongs
to
me
he
will
not
forsake
me
in
life
he
will
be
near
me
god
grant
when
i
die
lady
maulevrier
as
far
as
in
me
lies
i
will
be
to
you
as
a
son
said
lord
hartfield
very
solemnly
stooping
to
kiss
her
hand
mary
came
away
from
her
to
embrace
her
grandmother
makes
me
so
happy
to
have
won
a
little
of
your
regard
she
murmured
to
know
that
i
have
married
a
man
whom
you
can
love
course
you
have
heard
of
lesbia
engagement
lady
maulevrier
said
presently
when
they
were
taking
their
tea
wrote
to
us
about
it
us
how
nice
it
sounded
thought
mary
as
if
they
were
a
firm
and
a
letter
written
to
one
was
written
to
both
do
you
know
this
mr
smithson
intimately
i
have
met
him
at
the
carlton
am
told
that
he
is
very
much
esteemed
by
your
party
and
that
he
is
very
likely
to
get
a
peerage
when
this
ministry
goes
out
of
office
is
not
improbable
peerages
are
to
be
had
if
a
man
is
rich
enough
and
smithson
is
supposed
to
be
inordinately
rich
hope
he
has
character
as
well
as
money
said
lady
maulevrier
gravely
do
you
think
a
man
can
become
inordinately
rich
in
a
short
time
with
unblemished
honour
are
told
that
nothing
is
impossible
answered
hartfield
can
remove
a
mountain
only
one
does
not
often
see
it
done
however
i
believe
smithson
character
is
fairly
good
as
millionaires
go
we
do
not
inquire
too
closely
into
these
things
nowadays
lady
maulevrier
sighed
and
held
her
peace
she
remembered
the
day
when
she
had
protested
vehemently
passionately
against
lesbia
marriage
with
a
poor
man
and
now
she
had
an
unhappy
feeling
about
wealth
a
doubt
a
dread
that
all
might
not
be
well
with
those
millions
that
some
portion
of
that
golden
tide
might
flow
from
impure
sources
she
had
lived
remote
from
the
world
but
she
had
read
the
papers
diligently
and
she
knew
how
often
the
splendour
of
commercial
wealth
has
been
suddenly
obscured
behind
a
black
cloud
of
obloquy
she
could
not
rejoice
heartily
at
the
idea
of
lesbia
engagement
am
to
see
the
man
early
in
august
she
said
as
if
she
were
talking
of
a
butler
hope
i
may
like
him
lady
kirkbank
tells
me
it
is
a
brilliant
marriage
and
i
must
take
her
word
what
can
do
for
my
granddaughter
a
useless
log
a
prisoner
in
two
rooms
is
very
hard
murmured
mary
tenderly
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
lesbia
should
not
be
happy
she
likes
a
brilliant
life
and
smithson
can
give
her
as
much
gaiety
and
variety
as
she
can
possibly
desire
and
after
all
yachts
and
horses
and
villas
and
diamonds
nice
things
are
the
things
for
which
half
the
world
is
ready
to
cheat
or
murder
the
other
half
said
lady
maulevrier
bitterly
she
had
told
herself
long
ago
that
wealth
was
power
and
she
had
sacrificed
many
things
her
own
peace
her
own
conscience
among
them
in
order
that
her
children
and
grandchildren
should
be
rich
and
knowing
this
she
felt
it
ill
became
her
to
be
scrupulous
and
to
inquire
too
closely
as
to
the
sources
of
smithson
wealth
he
was
rich
and
the
world
had
no
fault
to
find
with
him
he
had
attended
the
last
he
went
into
reputable
society
and
he
could
give
lesbia
all
those
things
which
the
world
calls
good
fräulein
müller
had
packed
her
heavy
old
german
trunks
and
had
gone
back
to
the
laden
with
presents
of
all
kinds
from
lady
maulevrier
so
mary
and
her
husband
felt
as
if
fellside
was
really
their
own
they
dined
with
her
ladyship
and
left
her
for
the
night
an
hour
after
dinner
and
then
they
went
down
to
the
gardens
and
roamed
about
in
the
twilight
and
talked
and
talked
and
talked
as
only
true
lovers
can
talk
be
they
strephon
and
daphne
in
life
glad
morning
or
darby
and
joan
and
lastly
they
went
down
to
the
lake
and
rowed
about
in
the
moonlight
and
talked
of
king
arthur
death
and
of
that
mystic
sword
excalibur
by
the
lonely
maiden
of
the
lake
they
spent
three
happy
days
in
wandering
about
the
neighbourhood
revisiting
in
the
delicious
freedom
of
their
wedded
life
those
spots
which
they
had
seen
together
when
mary
was
still
in
bondage
and
the
eye
of
propriety
as
represented
by
miss
müller
was
always
upon
her
now
they
were
free
to
go
where
they
pleased
to
linger
where
they
liked
they
belonged
to
each
other
and
were
under
no
other
dominion
the
dogcart
james
steadman
dogcart
which
he
had
rarely
used
during
the
last
six
months
was
put
in
requisition
and
lord
hartfield
drove
his
wife
about
the
country
they
went
to
the
langdale
pikes
and
to
dungeon
ghyll
and
standing
beside
the
waterfall
mary
told
her
husband
how
miserable
she
had
felt
on
that
very
spot
a
little
less
than
a
year
ago
when
she
believed
that
he
thought
her
plain
and
altogether
horrid
whereupon
he
had
to
console
her
with
many
kisses
and
sweet
words
for
the
bygone
pain
on
her
part
the
neglect
on
his
was
a
wretch
he
said
besotted
imbecile
no
no
lesbia
is
very
lovely
and
i
could
not
expect
you
would
care
for
me
till
she
was
gone
away
how
glad
i
am
that
she
went
added
mary
naïvely
the
sky
which
had
been
cloudless
all
day
began
to
darken
as
lord
hartfield
drove
back
to
fellside
and
mary
drew
a
little
closer
to
the
driver
elbow
as
if
for
shelter
from
an
impending
tempest
have
your
waterproof
of
course
he
said
looking
down
at
her
as
the
first
big
drops
of
a
thunder
shower
dashed
upon
the
young
woman
in
the
lake
country
would
think
of
being
without
a
waterproof
mary
was
duly
provided
and
with
the
help
of
the
groom
put
herself
into
a
snug
little
tartan
inverness
while
hartfield
sent
the
cart
spinning
along
twelve
miles
an
hour
they
were
at
fellside
before
the
storm
developed
its
full
power
but
the
sky
was
leaden
the
landscape
dull
and
blotted
the
atmosphere
heavy
and
stifling
the
thunder
grumbled
hoarsely
far
away
yonder
in
the
wild
gorges
of
borrowdale
and
mary
and
her
husband
made
up
their
minds
that
the
tempest
would
come
before
midnight
lady
maulevrier
was
suffering
from
the
condition
of
the
atmosphere
she
had
gone
to
bed
prostrate
with
a
neuralgic
headache
and
had
given
orders
that
no
one
but
her
maid
should
go
near
her
so
lord
hartfield
and
his
wife
dined
by
themselves
in
the
room
where
mary
had
eaten
so
many
uninteresting
dinners
with
fräulein
and
in
spite
of
the
storm
which
howled
pelted
and
lightened
every
now
and
then
mary
felt
as
if
she
were
in
paradise
there
was
no
chance
of
going
out
after
dinner
the
lake
looked
like
a
pool
of
ink
the
mountains
were
monsters
of
dark
and
threatening
aspect
the
rain
rattled
against
the
windows
and
ran
from
the
verandah
in
miniature
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
stay
in
doors
in
the
sultry
dusky
house
us
go
to
my
boudoir
said
mary
me
enjoy
the
full
privilege
of
having
a
boudoir
my
very
own
room
was
it
too
good
of
grandmother
to
have
it
made
so
smart
for
me
can
be
too
good
for
my
mary
answered
her
husband
still
in
the
doting
stage
it
was
very
nice
of
her
ladyship
and
the
room
is
charming
delightful
as
the
new
boudoir
might
be
they
dawdled
in
the
picture
gallery
that
long
corridor
on
which
all
the
upper
rooms
opened
and
at
one
end
of
which
was
the
door
of
lady
maulevrier
bedroom
at
right
angles
with
that
door
which
was
never
opened
except
to
give
egress
or
ingress
to
james
steadman
who
kept
the
key
of
it
as
if
the
old
part
of
fellside
house
had
been
an
enchanted
castle
lord
hartfield
had
not
forgotten
that
summer
midnight
last
year
when
his
meditations
were
disturbed
by
a
woman
piercing
cry
he
thought
of
it
this
evening
as
mary
and
he
lowered
their
voices
on
drawing
near
lady
door
she
was
asleep
within
there
now
perhaps
that
strange
old
woman
and
at
any
moment
an
awful
shriek
as
of
a
soul
in
mortal
agony
might
startle
them
in
the
midst
of
their
bliss
the
lamps
were
lighted
below
but
this
upper
part
of
the
house
was
wrapped
in
the
dull
grey
twilight
of
a
stormy
evening
a
single
lamp
burned
dimly
at
the
further
end
of
the
corridor
and
all
the
rest
was
shadow
mary
and
her
husband
walked
up
and
down
talking
in
subdued
tones
he
was
explaining
the
necessity
of
his
being
in
london
next
week
and
promising
to
come
back
to
fellside
directly
his
business
at
the
house
was
over
will
be
delightful
to
read
your
speeches
said
mary
i
am
silly
and
selfish
enough
to
wish
you
were
a
country
squire
with
no
business
in
london
and
yet
i
do
wish
that
either
for
i
am
intensely
proud
of
you
some
day
before
we
are
much
older
you
will
sit
in
your
robes
in
the
peeress
gallery
i
could
cried
mary
should
make
a
fool
of
myself
somehow
i
should
look
like
a
housemaid
in
borrowed
plumes
remember
i
have
no
i
have
been
told
so
all
my
life
will
be
one
of
the
prettiest
peeresses
who
ever
sat
in
that
gallery
and
the
purest
and
truest
and
dearest
protested
her
if
i
am
good
enough
for
you
i
am
satisfied
i
married
and
not
the
house
of
lords
but
i
am
afraid
your
friends
will
all
say
hartfield
why
in
heaven
name
did
you
marry
that
uncultivated
person
look
she
stopped
suddenly
with
her
hand
on
her
husband
arm
it
was
growing
momentarily
darker
in
the
corridor
they
were
at
the
end
near
the
lamp
and
that
other
end
by
lady
maulevrier
door
was
in
deeper
darkness
yet
not
too
dark
for
lord
hartfield
to
see
what
it
was
to
which
mary
pointed
the
door
was
open
and
a
faint
glimmer
of
light
showed
within
a
man
was
standing
in
the
corridor
a
small
shrunken
figure
bent
and
old
is
steadman
uncle
said
mary
let
me
go
and
speak
to
him
poor
poor
old
man
madman
exclaimed
hartfield
mary
go
to
your
room
at
once
i
get
him
back
to
his
own
den
he
is
not
mad
at
any
rate
he
is
quite
harmless
let
me
just
say
a
few
words
to
him
surely
i
am
safe
with
you
lord
hartfield
was
not
inclined
to
dispute
that
argument
indeed
he
felt
himself
strong
enough
to
protect
his
wife
from
all
the
lunatics
in
bedlam
he
went
towards
the
end
of
the
corridor
keeping
mary
well
behind
him
but
mary
did
not
mean
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
renewing
her
acquaintance
with
steadman
uncle
hope
you
are
better
poor
old
soul
she
murmured
gently
lovingly
almost
nestling
at
her
husband
side
is
it
you
cried
the
old
man
tremulous
with
joy
i
have
been
looking
for
you
looking
looking
waiting
waiting
for
you
i
have
been
hoping
for
you
every
hour
and
every
minute
why
you
come
to
me
cruel
girl
tried
with
all
my
might
said
mary
people
blocked
up
the
door
in
the
stables
and
they
would
let
me
go
to
you
and
i
have
been
rather
busy
for
the
last
fortnight
added
mary
blushing
in
the
darkness
i
am
married
to
this
gentleman
ah
that
is
a
good
thing
he
will
take
care
of
you
if
he
is
an
honest
man
thought
he
was
an
honest
man
but
he
has
turned
out
to
be
an
earl
answered
mary
proudly
husband
is
lord
hartfield
hartfield
the
old
man
repeated
feebly
i
have
heard
that
name
before
there
was
no
violence
in
his
manner
nothing
but
imbecility
so
lord
hartfield
made
up
his
mind
that
mary
was
right
and
that
the
old
man
was
quite
harmless
worthy
of
all
compassion
and
kindly
treatment
this
was
the
same
old
man
whom
he
had
met
on
the
fell
in
the
bleak
march
morning
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
about
that
although
he
could
hardly
see
the
man
face
in
the
shadowy
corridor
said
the
man
with
me
my
dear
you
forgot
me
but
i
have
not
forgotten
you
i
mean
to
leave
you
my
fortune
come
with
me
and
i
show
you
your
legacy
it
is
all
for
you
every
rupee
every
jewel
this
word
rupee
startled
lord
hartfield
it
had
a
strange
sound
from
the
lips
of
a
westmoreland
peasant
child
come
said
the
man
impatiently
and
see
what
i
have
left
you
in
my
will
i
make
a
new
will
every
day
but
i
leave
everything
to
you
every
will
is
in
your
favour
but
if
you
are
married
you
had
better
have
your
legacy
at
once
your
husband
is
strong
enough
to
take
care
of
you
and
your
fortune
old
man
whispered
mary
let
us
humour
him
it
was
the
usual
madman
fancy
no
doubt
boundless
wealth
exalted
rank
sanctity
power
these
things
all
belong
to
the
lunatic
he
is
the
lord
of
creation
and
fed
by
such
fancies
he
enjoys
flashes
of
wild
happiness
in
the
midst
of
his
woe
come
both
of
you
said
the
old
man
eagerly
breathless
with
impatience
he
led
the
way
across
the
sacred
threshold
looking
back
beckoning
to
them
with
his
wasted
old
hand
and
mary
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
entered
that
house
which
had
seemed
to
her
from
her
very
childhood
as
a
temple
of
silence
and
mystery
the
passage
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
little
lamp
on
a
bracket
the
old
man
crept
along
stealthily
looking
back
with
a
face
full
of
cunning
till
he
came
to
a
broad
landing
from
which
an
old
staircase
with
massive
oak
banisters
led
down
to
the
square
hall
below
the
ceilings
were
low
the
passages
were
narrow
all
things
in
the
house
were
curiously
different
from
that
spacious
mansion
which
lady
maulevrier
had
built
for
herself
a
door
on
the
landing
stood
ajar
the
old
man
pushed
it
open
and
went
in
followed
by
mary
and
her
husband
they
both
expected
to
see
a
room
humble
almost
to
poverty
an
iron
bedstead
perhaps
and
such
furniture
as
the
under
servants
in
a
nobleman
household
are
privileged
to
enjoy
both
were
alike
surprised
at
the
luxury
of
the
apartment
they
entered
and
which
was
evidently
reserved
exclusively
for
steadman
uncle
it
was
a
the
furniture
was
but
almost
as
handsome
as
any
in
lady
maulevrier
apartments
there
was
a
large
sofa
of
most
comfortable
shape
covered
with
dark
red
velvet
and
furnished
with
pillows
and
foot
rugs
which
would
have
satisfied
a
sybarite
of
the
first
water
beside
the
sofa
stood
a
hookah
with
all
appliances
in
the
oriental
fashion
and
half
a
dozen
long
pipes
neatly
arranged
above
the
mantelpiece
showed
that
steadman
uncle
was
a
smoker
of
a
luxurious
type
in
the
centre
of
the
room
stood
a
large
writing
table
with
a
case
of
at
the
back
a
table
which
would
not
have
disgraced
a
prime
minister
study
a
pair
of
wax
candles
in
tall
silver
candlesticks
lighted
this
table
which
was
littered
with
papers
in
a
wild
confusion
that
too
plainly
indicated
the
condition
of
the
owner
mind
the
oak
floor
was
covered
with
persian
prayer
rugs
old
and
faded
but
of
the
richest
quality
the
window
curtains
were
dark
red
velvet
and
through
an
open
doorway
mary
and
her
husband
saw
a
corresponding
luxury
in
the
arrangements
of
the
adjoining
bedroom
the
whole
thing
seemed
wild
and
strange
as
a
fairy
tale
the
weird
and
wizened
old
man
grinning
and
nodding
his
head
at
them
the
handsome
room
rich
with
dark
subdued
colour
in
the
dim
light
of
four
wax
candles
two
on
the
table
two
on
the
mantelpiece
the
perfume
of
stephanotis
and
blended
faintly
with
the
odour
of
latakia
and
turkish
attar
all
was
alike
strange
bearing
in
mind
that
this
old
man
was
a
recipient
of
lady
maulevrier
charity
a
upon
a
confidential
servant
who
might
be
supposed
to
be
generously
treated
if
he
had
the
run
of
his
teeth
and
the
shelter
of
a
decent
garret
verily
there
was
something
regal
in
such
hospitality
as
this
accorded
to
a
pauper
lunatic
where
was
steadman
the
alert
the
watchful
all
this
time
mary
wondered
they
had
met
no
one
the
house
was
as
mute
as
if
it
were
under
the
spell
of
a
magician
it
was
like
that
awful
chamber
in
the
arabian
story
where
the
young
man
found
the
magic
horse
and
started
on
his
fatal
journey
mary
felt
as
if
here
too
there
must
be
peril
here
too
fate
was
working
the
old
man
went
to
the
writing
table
pushed
aside
the
papers
and
then
stooped
down
and
turned
a
mysterious
handle
or
winch
under
the
and
the
moved
slowly
on
one
side
while
the
sank
and
a
deep
well
full
of
secret
drawers
was
laid
open
from
one
of
these
secret
drawers
the
old
man
took
a
bunch
of
keys
nodding
chuckling
muttering
to
himself
as
he
groped
for
them
with
tremulous
hand
is
uncommonly
clever
thinks
he
knows
everything
but
he
does
know
the
trick
of
this
table
i
could
hide
a
regiment
of
sepoys
in
this
table
my
dear
well
well
perhaps
not
sepoys
too
big
too
big
but
i
could
hide
all
the
state
papers
of
the
presidency
there
are
drawers
enough
for
that
hartfield
watched
him
intently
with
thoughtful
brow
there
was
a
mystery
here
a
mystery
of
the
deepest
dye
and
it
was
for
him
it
must
needs
be
his
task
welcome
or
unwelcome
to
unravel
it
this
was
the
maulevrier
skeleton
come
with
me
said
the
old
man
clutching
mary
wrist
and
drawing
her
towards
the
door
leading
into
the
bedroom
she
had
a
feeling
of
shrinking
for
there
was
something
uncanny
about
the
old
man
something
that
might
be
life
or
death
might
belong
to
this
world
or
the
next
but
she
had
no
fear
in
the
first
place
she
was
courageous
by
nature
and
in
the
second
her
husband
was
with
her
a
tower
of
strength
and
she
could
know
no
fear
while
he
was
at
her
side
the
strange
old
man
led
the
way
across
his
bedroom
to
an
inner
chamber
oak
pannelled
with
very
little
furniture
but
holding
much
treasure
in
the
shape
of
trunks
portmanteaux
all
very
old
and
dusty
and
two
large
wooden
cases
banded
with
iron
before
one
of
these
cases
the
man
knelt
down
and
applied
a
key
to
the
padlock
which
fastened
it
he
gave
the
candle
to
lord
hartfield
to
hold
and
then
opened
the
box
it
seemed
to
be
full
of
books
which
he
began
to
remove
heaping
them
on
the
floor
beside
him
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
cleared
away
a
layer
of
dingy
volumes
that
he
came
to
a
large
metal
strong
box
so
heavy
that
he
could
not
lift
it
out
of
the
chest
slowly
tremulously
and
with
quickened
breathing
he
unlocked
the
box
where
it
was
and
raised
the
lid
he
said
eagerly
is
her
legacy
this
is
my
little
legacy
lord
hartfield
bent
down
and
looked
at
the
old
man
treasure
by
the
wavering
light
of
the
candle
mary
looking
over
his
shoulder
breathless
with
wonder
the
strong
box
was
divided
into
compartments
one
and
the
largest
was
filled
with
rouleaux
of
coin
packed
as
closely
as
possible
the
others
contained
jewels
set
and
unset
diamonds
emeralds
rubies
sapphires
which
flashed
back
the
flickering
flame
of
the
candle
with
glintings
of
rainbow
light
are
all
for
her
all
all
exclaimed
the
old
man
are
worth
a
prince
ransom
those
rouleaux
are
all
gold
those
gems
are
priceless
they
were
the
dowry
of
a
princess
but
they
are
hers
now
yes
my
dear
they
are
yours
because
you
spoke
sweetly
and
smiled
prettily
and
were
very
good
to
a
lonely
old
man
and
because
you
have
my
mother
face
dear
a
smile
that
recalls
the
days
of
my
youth
lift
out
the
box
and
take
it
away
with
you
if
you
are
strong
enough
you
you
he
said
touching
lord
hartfield
it
somewhere
keep
it
from
let
no
one
know
no
one
except
your
wife
and
you
must
be
in
the
secret
dear
sir
it
is
out
of
the
question
impossible
that
my
wife
or
i
should
accept
one
of
those
coins
or
the
smallest
of
those
jewels
not
in
the
devil
name
and
foremost
we
do
not
know
how
you
came
in
possession
of
them
secondly
we
do
not
know
who
you
are
came
to
me
fairly
enough
bequeathed
to
me
by
one
who
had
the
right
to
leave
them
would
you
have
had
all
that
gold
left
for
an
adventurer
to
wallow
in
must
keep
your
treasure
sir
however
it
may
have
come
to
you
answered
lord
hartfield
firmly
wife
can
not
take
upon
herself
the
burden
of
a
single
gold
coin
least
of
all
from
a
stranger
remember
sir
to
us
your
possession
of
this
wealth
nay
your
whole
existence
is
a
mystery
want
to
know
who
i
am
said
the
old
man
drawing
himself
up
with
a
sudden
which
was
not
without
dignity
despite
his
shrunken
form
and
grotesque
appearence
sir
i
am
he
checked
himself
abruptly
and
looked
round
the
room
with
a
scared
expression
no
no
he
muttered
caution
they
have
not
done
with
me
yet
she
warned
me
they
are
lying
in
wait
i
must
walk
into
their
trap
and
then
turning
to
lord
hartfield
he
said
haughtily
shall
not
condescend
to
tell
you
who
i
am
sir
you
must
know
that
i
am
a
gentleman
and
that
is
enough
for
you
there
is
my
gift
to
your
wife
pointing
to
the
chest
it
or
leave
it
shall
leave
it
sir
with
all
due
respect
a
frightful
change
came
over
the
old
man
face
at
this
determined
refusal
his
eyes
glowered
at
lord
hartfield
under
the
heavy
scowling
brows
his
bloodless
lips
worked
convulsively
you
take
me
for
a
thief
he
exclaimed
you
afraid
to
touch
my
gold
that
gold
for
which
men
and
women
sell
their
souls
blast
their
lives
with
shame
and
pain
and
dishonour
all
the
world
over
do
you
stand
aloof
from
it
refuse
to
touch
it
as
if
it
were
infected
and
you
too
girl
have
you
no
sense
are
you
an
idiot
can
do
nothing
against
my
husband
wish
mary
answered
quietly
indeed
there
is
no
need
for
us
to
take
your
money
we
are
rich
without
it
please
leave
that
chest
to
a
hospital
it
will
be
ever
so
much
better
than
giving
it
to
us
told
me
you
were
going
to
marry
a
poor
man
know
but
he
cheated
me
and
turned
out
to
be
a
rich
man
he
was
a
horrid
impostor
said
mary
drawing
closer
to
her
husband
and
smiling
up
at
him
the
old
man
flung
down
the
lid
of
his
strong
box
which
shut
with
a
sonorous
clang
he
locked
it
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
have
done
with
you
he
said
can
go
your
ways
both
of
you
fools
fools
fools
the
world
is
peopled
with
rogues
and
fools
and
by
heaven
i
would
rather
have
to
do
with
the
rogues
he
flung
himself
into
an
one
of
the
few
objects
of
furniture
in
the
room
and
left
them
to
find
their
way
back
alone
sir
said
lord
hartfield
but
the
old
man
made
no
reply
he
sat
frowning
sullenly
sir
said
mary
in
her
gentle
voice
breathing
infinite
pity
child
he
growled
am
sorry
you
have
married
an
ass
this
was
more
than
mary
could
stand
and
she
was
about
to
reply
with
some
acrimony
when
her
husband
put
his
hand
upon
her
lips
and
hurried
her
away
on
the
landing
they
met
steadman
a
stout
commonplace
person
who
always
had
the
same
look
as
of
one
who
lived
in
the
shadow
of
an
abiding
terror
obviously
cowed
and
by
her
husband
according
to
the
fellside
household
at
sight
of
lord
hartfield
and
his
wife
she
looked
a
little
more
frightened
than
usual
gracious
lady
mary
how
ever
did
you
come
here
she
gasped
not
yet
having
quite
realised
the
fact
that
mary
had
been
promoted
came
to
please
steadman
uncle
he
brought
us
in
here
mary
answered
quietly
where
did
you
find
him
the
corridor
just
by
her
ladyship
room
he
must
have
taken
the
key
out
of
steadman
pocket
or
steadman
must
have
left
it
about
somewhere
muttered
steadman
as
if
explaining
the
matter
to
herself
rather
than
to
mary
poor
husband
is
not
the
man
he
was
and
so
you
met
him
in
the
corridor
and
he
brought
you
in
here
poor
old
gentleman
he
gets
madder
and
madder
every
day
is
method
in
his
madness
said
lord
hartfield
talked
very
much
like
sanity
just
now
has
your
husband
had
the
charge
of
him
long
steadman
answered
somewhat
confusedly
goodish
time
sir
i
ca
quite
exactly
say
time
passes
so
quiet
in
a
place
like
this
one
hardly
keeps
count
of
the
years
years
perhaps
steadman
blenched
under
lord
hartfield
steadfast
look
a
look
which
questioned
more
searchingly
than
his
words
years
she
repeated
with
a
faint
laugh
dear
no
sir
not
a
quarter
as
long
it
is
so
many
years
after
all
since
poor
old
uncle
went
a
little
queer
in
his
head
and
steadman
having
such
a
quiet
home
here
and
plenty
of
spare
room
made
bold
to
ask
her
ladyship
if
he
might
give
the
poor
old
man
a
home
where
he
would
be
in
nobody
way
the
poor
old
man
seems
to
have
a
very
luxurious
home
answered
lord
hartfield
when
and
where
did
steadman
uncle
learn
to
smoke
a
hookah
simple
as
the
question
was
it
proved
too
much
for
steadman
she
only
shook
her
head
and
faltered
some
unintelligible
reply
is
your
husband
asked
lord
hartfield
should
like
to
have
a
little
talk
with
him
if
he
is
disengaged
is
not
very
well
my
lord
answered
steadman
has
been
ailing
off
and
on
for
the
last
six
months
but
i
could
get
him
to
see
the
doctor
or
to
tell
her
ladyship
that
he
was
in
bad
health
and
about
a
week
ago
he
broke
down
altogether
and
fell
into
a
kind
of
drowsy
state
he
keeps
about
and
he
does
his
work
pretty
much
the
same
as
usual
but
i
can
see
that
it
too
much
for
him
if
you
like
to
come
downstairs
i
can
let
you
through
the
lower
door
into
the
hall
and
if
he
should
have
woke
up
since
i
have
left
him
he
be
at
your
service
but
i
rather
not
wake
him
out
of
his
sleep
is
no
occasion
what
i
have
to
say
will
keep
till
lord
hartfield
and
his
wife
followed
steadman
downstairs
to
the
low
dark
hall
where
an
old
clock
ticked
with
hoarse
and
solemn
beat
and
a
fine
stag
head
over
each
doorway
gave
evidence
of
some
former
haselden
sporting
tastes
the
door
of
a
small
panelled
parlour
stood
open
and
within
the
room
lord
hartfield
saw
james
steadman
asleep
in
an
by
the
fire
which
burned
as
brightly
as
if
it
had
been
christmas
time
was
so
chilly
and
shivery
this
afternoon
that
i
was
obliged
to
light
a
fire
said
steadman
seems
to
be
sleeping
heavily
said
hartfield
awaken
him
i
see
him
morning
before
i
go
to
london
sleeps
half
the
day
just
as
heavy
as
that
my
lord
said
the
wife
with
a
troubled
air
do
think
it
can
be
right
do
think
so
either
answered
lord
hartfield
had
better
call
in
the
doctor
will
my
lord
morning
james
will
be
angry
with
me
i
daresay
but
i
must
take
upon
myself
to
do
it
without
his
leave
she
led
the
way
along
a
passage
corresponding
with
the
one
above
and
unlocked
a
door
opening
into
a
lobby
near
the
molly
see
if
you
can
beat
me
at
a
fifty
game
said
lord
hartfield
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
wants
to
shake
off
the
impression
of
some
dominant
idea
course
you
will
annihilate
me
but
it
will
be
a
relief
to
play
answered
mary
strange
old
man
has
given
me
a
shock
everything
about
his
surroundings
is
so
different
from
what
i
expected
and
how
could
an
uncle
of
steadman
come
by
all
that
money
and
those
jewels
if
they
were
jewels
and
not
bits
of
glass
which
the
poor
old
thing
has
chopped
up
in
order
to
delude
himself
with
an
imaginary
treasure
do
not
think
they
are
bits
of
glass
molly
sparkled
tremendously
almost
as
much
as
my
our
the
family
diamonds
said
mary
puzzled
how
to
describe
that
property
which
she
held
in
right
of
her
position
as
countess
regnant
if
they
are
real
jewels
and
all
those
rouleaux
real
money
how
could
steadman
uncle
become
possessed
of
such
wealth
indeed
said
lord
hartfield
choosing
his
cue
chapter

on
board
the

had
come
and
gone
a
brief
bright
season
of

babble
of

humiliations
a
very
pretty
picture
to
contemplate
from
the
outside
this
little
world
in
holiday
clothes
framed
in
greenery
but
just
on
the
brocken
where
the
nicest
girl
among
the
dancers
had
the
unpleasant
peculiarity
of
dropping
a
little
red
mouse
out
of
her
mouth
so
too
here
under
different
forms
there
were
red
mice
dropping
about
among
the
company
here
a
hint
of
coming
insolvency
there
a
whisper
of
a
threatened

suit
staved
off
for
a
while
compromises
family
secrets
little

everywhere
betrothed
couples
smilingly
accepting

who
should
never
have

the
rule
of

forsaken

pretending
to
think
their

models
of
fidelity
jovial
creatures
with
ruin
staring
in
their
faces
households
divided
and
shamming
union
almost
everybody
living
above
his
or
her
means
and
the
knowledge
that
nobody
is
any
better
or
any
happier
than
his
neighbour
society
only
fountain
of
consolation
lady
lesbia
gowns
and
parasols
had
been
admired
her
engagement
had
furnished
an
infinity
of
gossip
and
the
fact
of
montesma
constant
attendance
upon
her
had
given
zest
to
the
situation
just
that
flavour
of
peril
and
fatality
which
the
soul
of
society
loveth
she
going
to
marry
them
both
asked
an
ancient
dowager
of
the
type
dear
lady
sevenoaks
she
can
only
marry
one
do
you
know
but
the
other
is
nice
to
go
about
with
and
i
believe
it
is
the
other
she
really
likes
is
always
the
other
that
a
woman
likes
answered
the
dowager
am
madly
in
love
with
this
peruvian
no
i
think
you
said
cuban
myself
i
wish
some
creature
would
present
him
to
me
if
you
know
anybody
who
knows
him
tell
them
to
bring
him
to
my
next
afternoon
saturday
but
why
does
smithson
allow
such
a
handsome
after
marriage
i
could
understand
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
help
himself
but
before
marriage
a
man
generally
has
some
kind
of
authority
the
world
wondered
a
little
just
as
lady
sevenoaks
wondered
at
smithson
complacency
in
allowing
a
man
so
attractive
as
montesma
to
be
so
much
in
the
society
of
his
future
wife
yet
even
the
censorious
could
but
admit
that
the
cuban
manner
offered
no
ground
for
offence
he
came
to
goodwood
his
own
hook
as
society
put
it
and
every
man
who
wears
a
decent
coat
and
is
not
a
welsher
has
a
right
to
enjoy
the
prettiest
in
england
he
spent
a
considerable
part
of
the
day
in
lesbia
company
but
since
she
was
the
centre
of
a
little
crowd
all
the
time
there
could
be
no
offence
in
this
he
was
a
stranger
knowing
very
few
people
and
having
nothing
to
do
but
to
amuse
himself
smithson
was
an
old
and
familiar
friend
and
was
in
a
measure
bound
to
give
him
hospitality
smithson
had
recognised
that
obligation
but
in
a
somewhat
sparing
manner
there
were
a
dozen
unoccupied
bedchambers
in
the
park
lane
renaissance
villa
but
smithson
did
not
invite
his
cuban
acquaintance
to
shift
his
quarters
from
the
bristol
to
park
lane
he
was
civil
to
don
gomez
but
anyone
who
had
taken
the
trouble
to
watch
and
study
the
conduct
and
social
relations
of
these
two
men
would
have
seen
that
his
civility
was
a
forced
civility
and
that
he
endured
the
society
under
constraint
of
some
kind
and
now
all
the
world
was
flocking
to
cowes
for
the
regatta
and
lesbia
and
her
chaperon
were
established
on
board
smithson
yacht
the
and
the
captain
of
the
and
all
her
crew
were
delivered
over
to
lesbia
to
be
her
slaves
and
to
obey
her
lightest
breath
the
was
to
lie
at
anchor
off
cowes
for
the
regatta
week
and
then
she
was
to
sail
for
hyde
and
lie
at
anchor
there
for
another
regatta
week
and
she
was
to
be
a
floating
hotel
for
lady
lesbia
so
long
as
the
young
lady
would
condescend
to
occupy
her
the
captain
was
an
altogether
exceptional
captain
and
the
crew
were
a
picked
crew
ruddy
faced
sandy
whiskered
for
the
most
part
englishmen
all
honest
hardy
fellows
from
between
the
nore
and
the
wash
talking
in
an
honest
provincial
patois
dashed
with
sea
slang
they
were
the
very
pink
and
pattern
of
cleanliness
and
the
herself
from
stem
to
stern
was
dazzling
and
spotless
to
an
almost
painful
degree
not
content
with
the
existing
arrangements
of
the
yacht
which
were
at
once
elegant
and
luxurious
smithson
had
sent
down
a
bond
street
upholsterer
to
refit
the
saloon
and
lady
lesbia
cabin
the
dark
velvet
and
morocco
which
suited
a
masculine
occupant
would
not
have
harmonised
with
girlhood
and
beauty
and
smithson
saloon
as
originally
designed
had
something
of
the
air
of
a
the
bond
street
man
stripped
away
all
the
velvet
and
morocco
plucked
up
the
turkey
carpet
draped
the
with
pale
yellow
cretonne
garnished
with
orange
pompons
subdued
the
glare
of
the
skylight
by
a
blind
of
oriental
silk
covered
the
divans
with
persian
saddlebags
the
floor
with
a
delicate
indian
matting
and
furnished
the
saloon
with
all
that
was
most
feminine
in
the
way
of
bamboo
chairs
and
japanese
screens
and
fans
of
gorgeous
colouring
here
and
there
against
the
fluted
yellow
drapery
he
fastened
a
large
rhodes
plate
and
the
thing
was
done
lady
cabin
was
all
bamboo
and
embroidered
india
muslin
an
oval
glass
framed
in
dresden
biscuit
adorned
the
side
a
large
white
bearskin
covered
the
floor
the
berth
was
pretty
enough
for
the
cradle
of
a
duchess
first
baby
even
lesbia
spoiled
by
much
indulgence
and
unlimited
credit
gave
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
at
sight
of
the
nest
that
had
been
made
ready
for
her
smithson
is
immensely
kind
she
exclaimed
is
always
kind
answered
lady
kirkbank
you
do
half
enough
appreciate
him
he
has
given
me
his
very
own
cabin
such
a
dear
little
den
there
are
his
cigar
boxes
and
everything
lovely
on
the
shelves
and
his
own
particular
put
open
for
me
to
use
all
the
backs
of
all
the
brushes
silver
and
all
the
filled
expressly
for
me
if
the
yacht
would
only
stand
quite
still
i
should
think
it
more
delicious
than
the
best
house
i
ever
stayed
in
only
i
do
altogether
enjoy
that
little
way
it
has
of
gurgling
up
and
down
perpetually
smithson
chief
butler
a
german
swiss
and
a
treasure
of
intelligence
had
come
down
to
take
the
domestic
arrangements
of
the
yacht
into
his
control
the
park
lane
was
also
on
board
smithson
steward
acting
as
his
subordinate
this
great
man
grumbled
sorely
at
the
smallness
of
his
surroundings
for
the
most
luxurious
yacht
was
a
poor
substitute
for
the
spacious
kitchens
and
storerooms
and
stillrooms
of
the
london
mansion
there
was
a
cabin
for
lady
rilboche
and
lady
lesbia
kibble
where
the
two
might
squabble
at
their
leisure
in
a
word
everything
had
been
done
that
forethought
could
do
to
make
the
yacht
as
perfect
a
place
of
sojourn
as
any
floating
habitation
from
noah
ark
to
the
orient
steamers
had
ever
been
made
it
was
between
four
and
five
upon
a
delicious
july
afternoon
that
lady
kirkbank
and
her
charge
came
on
board
the
maids
and
the
luggage
had
been
sent
a
day
in
advance
so
that
everything
might
be
in
its
place
and
the
empty
boxes
all
stowed
away
before
the
ladies
arrived
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
walk
on
board
and
fling
themselves
into
the
low
luxurious
chairs
ready
for
them
on
the
deck
a
little
wearied
by
the
heat
and
dust
of
a
railway
journey
and
with
that
delicious
sense
of
languid
indifference
to
all
the
cares
of
life
which
seems
to
be
in
the
very
atmosphere
of
a
perfect
summer
afternoon
a
striped
awning
covered
the
deck
and
great
baskets
of
roses
pink
and
red
and
yellow
were
placed
about
here
and
there
tea
was
ready
on
a
low
table
a
swinging
brass
kettle
hissing
merrily
with
an
air
of
supreme
homeliness
smithson
had
accompanied
his
from
town
and
now
sat
reading
the
and
meekly
waiting
for
his
tea
while
lesbia
took
a
languid
survey
of
the
shore
and
the
flotilla
of
boats
little
and
big
and
while
lady
kirkbank
rhapsodised
about
the
yacht
praising
everything
and
calling
everything
by
a
wrong
name
he
was
to
be
their
guest
all
day
and
every
day
they
were
to
have
enough
of
him
as
lesbia
had
observed
to
her
chaperon
with
a
spice
of
discontent
not
quite
so
delighted
with
the
arrangement
as
her
faithful
swain
to
him
the
idea
was
rapture
have
contrived
somehow
to
keep
me
very
much
at
a
distance
hitherto
he
told
lesbia
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
we
were
almost
strangers
but
a
yacht
is
the
best
place
in
the
world
to
bring
two
people
together
and
a
week
at
cowes
will
make
us
nearer
to
each
other
and
more
to
each
other
than
three
months
in
london
and
lesbia
had
said
nothing
inwardly
revolting
at
the
idea
of
becoming
any
nearer
and
dearer
to
this
man
whom
she
had
pledged
herself
to
marry
she
was
to
be
his
wife
yes
some
day
and
it
was
his
desire
the
some
day
should
be
soon
but
in
the
interval
her
dearest
privilege
was
the
power
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
and
yet
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
break
with
him
to
say
honestly
never
liked
you
much
and
now
we
are
engaged
i
find
myself
liking
you
less
and
less
every
day
save
me
from
the
irrevocable
wickedness
of
a
loveless
marriage
forgive
me
and
let
me
go
no
this
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
she
did
not
like
smithson
but
she
valued
the
position
he
was
able
to
give
her
she
wanted
to
be
mistress
of
that
infinite
wealth
she
could
not
renounce
that
right
to
which
she
fancied
she
had
been
born
her
right
to
be
one
of
the
queens
of
society
and
the
only
man
who
had
offered
to
crown
her
as
queen
to
find
her
a
palace
and
a
court
was
horace
smithson
without
smithson
her
first
season
would
have
resulted
in
dire
failure
she
might
perhaps
have
endured
that
failure
and
been
content
to
abide
the
chances
of
a
second
season
had
it
not
been
for
mary
triumph
but
for
mary
to
be
a
countess
and
for
lesbia
to
remain
lesbia
haselden
a
nobody
dependent
upon
the
caprices
of
a
grandmother
whose
means
might
after
all
be
but
limited
no
such
a
concatenation
as
that
was
not
to
be
endured
lesbia
told
herself
that
she
could
not
go
back
to
fellside
to
remain
there
indefinitely
a
spinster
and
a
dependent
she
had
learnt
the
true
value
of
money
she
had
found
out
what
the
world
was
like
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
some
such
person
as
smithson
was
essential
to
her
existence
just
as
a
butler
is
a
necessity
in
a
house
one
may
not
like
the
man
but
the
post
must
be
filled
again
if
she
were
to
throw
over
smithson
and
speculate
upon
her
chances
of
next
year
what
hope
had
she
of
doing
better
in
her
second
season
than
in
her
first
the
horizon
was
blank
there
was
no
great
likely
to
offer
himself
for
competition
she
had
seen
all
that
the
market
could
produce
wealthy
bachelors
lovers
could
not
drop
from
the
moon
lesbia
schooled
by
lady
kirkbank
knew
her
peerage
by
heart
and
she
knew
that
having
missed
lord
hartfield
there
was
really
no
one
in
the
blue
book
worth
waiting
for
thus
caring
only
for
those
things
which
wealth
can
buy
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
could
not
do
without
horace
smithson
money
and
she
must
therefore
needs
resign
herself
to
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
taking
smithson
and
his
money
together
the
great
auctioneer
fate
would
not
divide
the
lot
she
told
herself
that
for
her
a
loveless
marriage
was
after
all
no
prodigious
sacrifice
she
had
found
out
that
heart
made
but
a
small
figure
in
the
sum
of
her
life
she
could
do
without
love
a
year
ago
she
had
fancied
herself
in
love
with
john
hammond
in
her
seclusion
at
st
bees
in
the
long
dull
august
days
sauntering
up
and
down
by
the
edge
of
the
sea
in
the
melancholy
sunset
hour
she
thought
that
her
heart
was
broken
that
life
was
worthless
without
the
man
she
loved
she
had
thought
and
felt
all
this
but
not
strongly
enough
to
urge
her
to
any
great
effort
not
keenly
enough
to
make
her
burst
her
chains
she
had
preferred
to
suffer
this
loss
than
to
sacrifice
her
chances
of
future
aggrandisement
and
now
she
looked
back
and
remembered
those
sunset
walks
by
the
sea
and
all
her
thoughts
and
feelings
in
those
silent
summer
hours
and
she
smiled
at
herself
half
in
scorn
half
in
pity
for
her
own
weakness
how
easily
she
had
learned
to
do
without
him
who
at
that
hour
seemed
the
better
part
of
her
existence
a
good
deal
of
gaiety
and
praise
a
little
mild
flirtation
at
kirkbank
castle
and
lo
the
image
of
her
first
lover
began
to
grow
dim
and
blurred
like
a
faded
photograph
a
season
at
cannes
and
she
was
cured
a
week
in
london
and
that
first
love
was
a
thing
of
the
past
a
dream
from
which
the
dreamer
awaketh
forgetting
the
things
that
he
has
dreamt
remembering
all
this
she
told
herself
that
she
had
no
heart
that
love
or
no
love
was
a
question
of
very
little
moment
and
that
the
personal
qualities
of
the
man
whom
she
chose
for
a
husband
mattered
nothing
to
her
provided
that
his
lands
and
houses
and
social
status
came
up
to
her
standard
of
merit
she
had
seen
smithson
houses
and
lands
and
she
was
distinctly
assured
that
he
would
in
due
course
be
raised
to
the
peerage
she
had
therefore
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
having
thus
reasoned
out
the
circumstances
of
her
new
life
she
accepted
her
fate
with
a
languid
grace
which
harmonised
with
her
delicate
and
patrician
beauty
nobody
could
have
for
a
moment
supposed
from
her
manner
that
she
loved
horace
smithson
but
nobody
had
the
right
to
think
that
she
detested
him
she
accepted
all
his
attentions
as
a
thing
of
course
the
flowers
which
he
strewed
beneath
her
footsteps
the
pearls
which
he
melted
in
her
wine
metaphorically
speaking
were
just
enough
and
no
more
this
afternoon
when
smithson
asked
her
how
she
liked
the
arrangements
of
the
saloon
and
cabin
she
said
she
thought
they
would
do
very
nicely
would
do
nothing
more
is
dreadfully
small
of
course
she
said
one
is
accustomed
to
rooms
but
it
is
rather
amusing
to
be
in
a
sort
of
doll
house
and
on
deck
it
is
really
very
nice
this
was
the
most
smithson
had
for
his
pains
and
he
seemed
to
be
content
therewith
if
a
man
will
marry
the
prettiest
girl
of
the
year
he
must
be
satisfied
with
such
scant
civility
as
conscious
perfection
may
give
him
we
know
that
aphrodite
was
not
altogether
the
most
comfortable
wife
and
that
helen
was
a
cause
of
trouble
smithson
sat
in
a
bamboo
chair
beside
his
mistress
and
looked
ineffably
happy
when
she
handed
him
a
cup
of
tea
sky
and
sea
were
one
exquisite
azure
the
colours
of
the
boats
glancing
in
the
sunshine
as
if
they
had
been
jewels
here
an
emerald
rudder
there
a
gunwale
painted
with
liquid
rubies
white
sails
white
frocks
white
ducks
made
vivid
patches
of
light
against
the
blue
the
landscape
yonder
shone
and
sparkled
as
if
it
had
been
incandescent
all
the
world
of
land
and
sky
and
sea
was
steeped
in
sunshine
a
day
on
which
to
do
nothing
read
nothing
think
nothing
only
to
exist
while
they
sat
basking
in
the
balmy
atmosphere
looking
lazily
at
that
bright
almost
insupportable
picture
of
blue
sea
under
blue
sky
there
came
the
dip
of
oars
making
music
and
a
sound
of
coolness
with
every
plash
of
water
good
it
is
of
somebody
to
row
about
just
to
give
us
that
nice
soothing
sound
murmured
lesbia
lady
kirkbank
with
her
dear
old
head
thrown
back
upon
the
cushion
of
her
luxurious
chair
and
her
dear
little
cornflower
hat
just
a
thought
on
one
side
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
and
unconsciously
revealing
the
little
golden
arrangements
which
gave
variety
to
her
front
teeth
the
soothing
sound
came
nearer
and
nearer
close
under
the
quarter
and
then
a
brown
hand
clasped
the
and
a
light
slim
figure
swung
itself
upon
deck
while
the
boat
bobbed
and
splashed
below
it
was
montesma
who
had
not
been
expected
till
the
racing
which
was
not
to
begin
for
two
days
a
faint
faint
rose
bloom
flushed
lady
lesbia
cheek
at
sight
of
him
and
smithson
gave
a
little
look
of
vexation
just
one
rapid
contraction
of
the
eyebrows
which
resumed
their
conventional
placidity
the
next
instant
good
of
you
he
murmured
really
did
not
expect
you
till
the
beginning
of
the
week
is
simply
insupportable
in
this
weather
most
of
all
for
a
man
born
in
the
havanas
my
soul
thirsted
for
blue
water
so
i
said
to
myself
this
good
smithson
is
at
cowes
he
will
give
me
the
run
of
his
yacht
and
a
room
at
his
villa
why
not
go
to
cowes
at
once
room
is
at
your
service
i
have
only
two
or
three
of
my
people
at
formosa
but
just
enough
to
look
after
a
bachelor
friend
want
very
little
service
my
dear
fellow
answered
montesma
pleasantly
man
who
has
crossed
the
cordilleras
and
camped
in
the
primeval
forest
on
the
shores
of
the
amazon
learns
to
help
himself
so
this
is
the
deleitoso
mi
a
floating
paradise
in
little
if
the
ark
had
been
like
this
i
do
think
any
of
the
passengers
would
have
wanted
the
flood
to
dry
up
he
shook
hands
with
lady
lesbia
as
he
spoke
and
with
lady
kirkbank
who
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
part
of
her
dream
and
then
he
sank
into
the
chair
on
lesbia
left
hand
with
the
air
of
being
established
for
the
rest
of
the
day
have
left
my
portmanteaux
at
the
end
of
the
pier
he
said
lazily
dare
say
one
of
your
fellows
will
be
good
enough
to
take
them
to
formosa
for
me
smithson
gave
the
necessary
order
all
the
beauty
had
gone
out
of
the
sea
and
the
sky
for
him
all
the
contentment
from
his
mind
and
yet
he
was
in
no
position
to
rebel
against
fate
in
no
position
to
say
directly
or
indirectly
gomez
de
montesma
i
do
want
you
here
and
i
must
request
you
to
transfer
yourself
elsewhither
lesbia
feelings
were
curiously
different
the
very
sight
of
that
nervous
brown
hand
upon
the
rope
just
now
had
sent
a
strange
thrill
through
her
veins
she
who
believed
herself
heartless
could
scarce
trust
herself
to
speak
for
the
vehement
throbbing
of
her
heart
a
sense
of
joy
too
deep
for
words
possessed
her
as
she
reclined
in
her
low
chair
with
drooping
eyelids
yet
feeling
the
fire
of
those
dark
southern
eyes
upon
her
face
scorching
her
like
an
actual
flame
lesbia
may
i
have
a
cup
of
tea
he
asked
not
because
he
wanted
the
tea
but
only
for
the
cruel
delight
of
seeing
if
she
were
able
to
give
it
to
him
calmly
her
hands
shook
fluttered
wandered
helplessly
as
she
poured
out
that
cup
of
tea
and
handed
it
to
montesma
a
feminine
office
which
she
had
performed
placidly
enough
for
smithson
the
spaniard
took
the
cup
from
her
with
a
quiet
smile
a
subtle
look
which
seemed
to
explore
the
inmost
depth
of
her
consciousness
yes
this
man
was
verily
her
master
she
knew
it
and
he
know
it
as
that
look
of
his
told
her
vain
to
play
her
part
of
languid
indifference
vain
to
struggle
against
her
bondage
in
heart
and
spirit
she
was
at
his
feet
an
odalisque
recognising
and
bowing
down
to
her
sultan
happily
for
the
general
peace
smithson
had
been
looking
away
seaward
with
a
somewhat
troubled
brow
while
that
little
cup
and
saucer
episode
was
being
enacted
and
in
the
next
minute
lesbia
had
recovered
her
and
resumed
that
graceful
languor
which
was
one
of
her
charms
she
was
weak
but
she
was
not
altogether
foolish
and
she
had
no
idea
of
succumbing
to
this
new
influence
of
yielding
herself
up
to
this
conqueror
who
seemed
to
take
her
life
into
his
hand
as
if
it
were
a
bit
of
thistledown
her
agitation
of
those
first
few
minutes
was
due
to
the
suddenness
of
his
appearance
the
reaction
from
dulness
to
delight
she
had
been
told
that
he
was
not
to
be
at
cowes
till
monday
and
lo
he
was
here
at
her
side
just
as
she
was
thinking
how
empty
and
dreary
life
was
without
him
he
dropped
into
his
place
so
naturally
and
easily
made
himself
so
thoroughly
at
home
and
so
agreeable
to
every
one
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
horace
smithson
to
resent
his
audacity
vitals
might
be
devoured
by
the
gnawing
of
the
monster
but
however
fierce
that
gnawing
were
he
did
not
want
to
seem
jealous
montesma
was
there
as
the
very
incarnation
of
some
experiences
in
smithson
past
career
and
he
dared
not
object
to
the
man
presence
and
so
the
summer
day
wore
on
they
had
the
yacht
all
to
themselves
that
evening
for
the
racing
yachts
were
fulfilling
engagements
in
other
waters
and
the
gay
company
of
had
not
yet
fully
assembled
they
were
dropping
in
one
by
one
all
the
evening
and
cowes
roads
grew
fuller
of
life
with
every
hour
of
the
summer
night
smithson
and
his
guests
dined
in
the
saloon
a
snug
little
party
of
four
and
sat
long
over
dessert
deep
into
the
dusk
and
they
talked
of
all
things
under
heaven
things
frivolous
things
grave
but
most
of
all
about
that
fair
strange
world
in
southern
waters
the
sunny
islands
of
the
caribbean
sea
and
the
dreamy
luxurious
life
of
that
tropical
clime
half
spanish
half
oriental
wholly
independent
of
european
conventionalities
lesbia
listened
enchanted
by
the
picture
what
were
park
lane
palaces
and
berkshire
manors
the
petty
splendours
of
the
architect
and
the
upholsterer
weighed
against
a
world
in
which
all
nature
is
on
a
grander
scale
smithson
might
give
her
fine
houses
and
costly
upholstery
but
only
the
tropic
of
cancer
could
give
her
larger
and
brighter
stars
a
world
of
richer
colouring
a
land
of
perpetual
summer
nights
luminous
with
gardens
in
which
the
fern
and
the
cactus
were
as
forest
trees
and
where
flashed
among
the
foliage
like
living
flowers
nay
where
the
flowers
themselves
took
the
forms
of
the
animal
world
and
seemed
instinct
with
life
and
motion
said
smithson
with
his
gentlemanlike
drawl
america
and
the
west
indies
are
delightful
places
to
talk
about
there
are
so
many
things
one
leaves
out
of
the
picture
thieves
niggers
jiggers
snakes
mosquitoes
yellow
jack
creeping
crawling
creatures
of
all
kinds
i
always
feel
very
glad
i
have
been
to
south
america
order
that
i
may
never
go
there
again
replied
smithson
was
beginning
to
hope
you
would
take
me
there
some
day
said
lesbia
again
no
not
even
for
your
sake
no
man
should
ever
leave
europe
after
he
is
indeed
i
doubt
if
after
that
age
he
should
venture
beyond
the
mediterranean
that
is
the
sea
of
civilisation
anything
outside
it
means
barbarism
hope
we
are
going
to
travel
said
lesbia
have
been
mewed
up
in
grasmere
half
my
life
and
if
you
are
going
to
confine
me
to
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
which
is
after
all
only
a
larger
lake
for
the
other
half
of
my
life
my
existence
will
be
a
dull
piece
of
work
after
all
i
agree
with
what
don
gomez
said
the
other
night
not
to
travel
is
not
to
live
they
went
on
deck
presently
and
sat
in
the
summer
darkness
lighted
only
by
the
stars
and
by
the
lights
of
the
yachts
and
the
faintly
gleaming
windows
of
the
lighted
town
sat
long
and
late
in
a
state
of
ineffable
repose
lady
kirkbank
fortified
by
the
produce
of
particular
and
by
a
couple
of
glasses
of
green
chartreuse
slept
profoundly
she
had
not
enjoyed
herself
so
much
for
the
last
three
months
she
had
been
stretched
on
society
rack
and
she
had
been
ground
in
society
mill
and
neither
mind
nor
body
had
been
her
own
to
do
what
she
liked
withal
she
had
toiled
early
and
late
and
had
spared
herself
in
no
wise
and
now
the
trouble
was
over
for
a
space
here
were
rest
and
respite
she
had
done
her
duty
as
a
chaperon
had
provided
her
charge
with
the
very
best
thing
the
matrimonial
market
offered
she
had
paid
her
creditors
something
on
account
all
round
and
had
left
them
appeased
and
trustful
if
not
content
sir
george
had
gone
oft
alone
to
drink
the
waters
at
spa
and
to
fortify
himself
for
scotland
and
the
grouse
season
she
was
her
own
mistress
and
she
could
fold
her
hands
and
take
her
rest
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
and
be
merry
all
at
smithson
expense
the
yachts
came
flocking
in
next
day
like
a
flight
of
sea
birds
and
smithson
had
enough
to
do
receiving
visitors
upon
the
he
was
fully
occupied
but
montesma
had
nothing
to
do
except
to
amuse
lady
lesbia
and
her
chaperon
and
in
this
onerous
task
he
succeeded
admirably
lesbia
found
that
it
was
too
warm
to
be
on
the
deck
when
there
were
perspiring
people
whose
breath
must
be
ninety
by
the
thermometer
perpetually
coming
on
board
so
she
and
lady
kirkbank
sat
in
the
saloon
and
had
the
more
distinguished
guests
brought
down
to
them
as
to
a
court
and
the
shrewder
of
the
guests
were
quick
to
divine
that
no
company
beyond
that
of
don
gomez
de
montesma
was
really
wanted
in
that
saloon
the
spaniard
taught
lady
kirkbank
which
delighted
her
and
which
she
vowed
she
would
introduce
at
her
supper
parties
in
the
half
season
of
november
when
she
should
be
in
london
for
a
week
or
two
as
a
bird
of
passage
flitting
southwards
he
began
to
teach
lesbia
spanish
a
language
for
which
she
had
taken
a
sudden
fancy
and
it
is
curious
what
tender
accents
what
hidden
meanings
even
a
grammar
can
take
from
such
a
teacher
spanish
came
easily
enough
to
a
learner
who
had
been
thoroughly
drilled
in
french
and
italian
and
who
had
been
taught
the
rudiments
of
latin
so
by
the
end
of
a
lesson
which
went
on
at
intervals
all
day
the
pupil
was
able
to
lisp
a
passage
of
don
quixote
in
the
sweetest
castilian
very
sweet
to
the
ear
of
don
gomez
a
kind
of
baby
language
precious
as
the
first
syllables
of
infancy
to
mothers
montesma
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
amuse
himself
and
his
companions
all
day
in
the
saloon
amidst
odours
of
roses
and
peaches
in
a
shadowy
coolness
made
by
striped
silken
blinds
but
smithson
was
not
so
much
his
own
master
that
innumerable
company
of
friends
which
are
the
portion
of
the
rich
man
given
to
hospitality
would
not
let
the
owner
of
the
go
at
a
place
like
cowes
on
the
eve
of
the
regatta
week
the
freelances
of
society
expect
to
find
entertainment
and
smithson
had
to
maintain
his
character
for
princely
hospitalities
at
the
sacrifice
of
his
feelings
as
a
lover
every
ripple
of
lesbia
silvery
laughter
every
deep
tone
of
montesma
voice
from
the
cabin
below
sent
a
pang
to
his
jealous
soul
and
yet
he
had
to
smile
and
to
order
more
champagne
cup
and
to
be
lavish
of
his
best
cigars
albeit
insisting
that
his
friends
should
smoke
their
cigars
in
the
bows
well
to
leeward
so
that
no
foul
breathings
of
tobacco
should
pollute
his
cleopatra
galley
cleopatra
was
very
happy
meanwhile
sublimely
indifferent
even
to
the
odours
of
tobacco
she
had
her
antony
at
her
feet
looking
up
at
her
as
she
recited
her
lesson
with
darkly
luminous
eyes
obviously
worshipping
her
obviously
intent
on
winning
her
without
counting
the
cost
when
had
a
montesma
ever
counted
the
cost
to
himself
or
others
the
cost
in
gold
in
honour
in
human
life
the
records
of
cuba
in
the
palmy
days
of
the
slave
trade
would
tell
how
lightly
they
held
the
last
and
for
honour
well
the
private
hells
of
island
and
main
could
tell
their
tale
of
specially
printed
playing
cards
in
which
the
swords
or
stars
on
the
back
of
each
card
had
a
secret
language
of
their
own
and
were
as
for
the
initiated
player
smithson
had
business
on
shore
and
was
fain
to
leave
the
yacht
for
an
hour
or
two
before
dinner
he
invited
don
gomez
to
go
with
him
but
the
offer
was
graciously
declined
i
do
care
even
to
look
at
land
in
such
weather
it
is
so
detestably
dry
he
pleaded
is
only
the
sound
of
the
sea
gurgling
against
the
hull
that
reconciles
one
to
existence
go
and
be
happy
at
your
club
and
send
off
those
occult
telegrams
of
yours
dearest
i
shall
not
leave
the
till
he
looked
as
fresh
and
cool
as
if
utterly
unaffected
by
the
heat
which
to
a
cuban
must
have
been
a
merely
lukewarm
condition
of
the
atmosphere
but
he
affected
to
be
prostrate
and
smithson
could
not
insist
he
had
his
cards
to
play
in
a
game
which
required
extremest
caution
and
there
were
no
friendly
indicators
on
the
backs
of
his
kings
and
aces
he
was
feeling
his
way
in
the
dark
and
did
not
know
how
much
mischief
montesma
was
prepared
to
do
when
the
owner
of
the
yacht
was
gone
don
gomez
proposed
an
adjournment
to
the
deck
for
afternoon
tea
and
the
trio
sat
under
the
awning
and
gossiping
for
the
next
hour
lady
kirkbank
told
the
steward
to
say
not
at
home
to
everybody
just
as
if
she
had
a
street
door
is
a
good
deal
of
the
far
about
this
said
montesma
presently
do
you
think
we
have
been
anchored
in
sight
of
that
shabby
little
town
quite
long
enough
and
that
it
would
be
rather
nice
to
spread
our
wings
and
sail
round
the
island
before
the
racing
begins
would
be
exquisite
said
lesbia
am
very
tired
of
inaction
though
i
dearly
love
learning
spanish
she
added
with
a
lovely
smile
and
a
look
that
was
half
submissive
half
mutinous
i
have
really
been
beginning
to
wonder
whether
this
boat
can
move
will
see
that
she
can
and
at
a
smart
pace
too
if
i
sail
her
shall
we
circumnavigate
the
island
we
can
set
sail
after
dinner
smithson
consent
do
you
think
does
smithson
exist
except
to
obey
you
do
know
if
lady
kirkbank
would
quite
like
it
said
lesbia
looking
at
her
chaperon
who
was
waving
a
big
japanese
fan
slowly
unsteadily
and
with
a
somewhat
drunken
air
the
while
she
slid
into
dreamland
like
what
she
murmured
drowsily
little
sail
should
dearly
love
it
if
it
did
make
me
on
a
glassy
lake
like
this
impossible
said
montesma
consider
the
thing
settled
we
set
sail
after
dinner
smithson
came
back
to
the
yacht
just
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
don
gomez
excused
himself
from
putting
on
his
dress
suit
he
was
going
to
sail
the
yacht
himself
and
he
was
dressed
for
his
work
picturesquely
in
white
duck
trousers
white
silk
shirt
and
black
velvet
shooting
jacket
he
dined
with
the
permission
of
the
ladies
in
this
costume
in
which
he
looked
so
much
handsomer
than
in
the
livery
of
polite
life
he
had
a
red
scarf
tied
round
his
waist
and
when
at
his
work
he
wore
a
little
red
silk
cap
just
stuck
lightly
on
his
dark
hair
the
dinner
was
all
animation
and
even
excitement
very
different
from
the
languorous
calm
of
yesterday
lesbia
seemed
a
new
creature
she
talked
and
laughed
and
flashed
and
sparkled
as
she
had
never
yet
done
within
smithson
experience
he
contemplated
the
transformation
with
wonder
not
unmixed
with
suspicion
never
for
him
had
she
been
so
brilliant
never
in
response
to
his
glances
had
her
violet
eyes
thus
kindled
had
her
smile
been
so
entrancingly
sweet
he
watched
montesma
but
in
him
he
could
find
no
fault
even
jealousy
could
hardly
take
objection
to
the
spaniard
manner
to
lady
lesbia
there
was
not
a
look
not
a
word
that
hinted
at
a
private
understanding
between
them
or
which
seemed
to
convey
deeper
meanings
than
the
common
language
of
society
no
there
was
no
ground
for
and
yet
smithson
was
miserable
he
knew
this
man
of
old
and
knew
his
influence
over
women
smithson
handed
over
the
management
of
the
yacht
without
a
murmer
albeit
he
pretended
to
be
able
to
sail
her
himself
and
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
the
command
for
a
couple
of
hours
on
a
sunny
afternoon
much
to
the
amusement
of
skipper
and
crew
but
montesma
was
a
sailor
born
and
bred
the
salt
keen
breath
of
the
sea
had
been
the
first
breath
in
his
nostrils
he
had
managed
his
light
felucca
before
he
was
twelve
years
old
had
sailed
every
inch
of
the
caribbean
sea
and
northward
to
the
furthermost
of
the
bahamas
before
he
was
fifteen
he
had
lived
more
on
the
water
than
on
the
land
in
that
wild
boyhood
of
his
a
boyhood
in
which
books
and
professors
had
played
but
small
part
montesma
school
had
been
the
world
and
beautiful
women
his
only
professors
he
had
learnt
arithmetic
from
the
transactions
of
bubble
companies
modern
languages
from
the
lips
of
the
women
who
loved
him
he
was
a
crack
shot
a
perfect
swordsman
a
reckless
horseman
and
a
dancer
in
whom
dancing
almost
rose
to
genius
beyond
these
limits
he
was
as
ignorant
as
dirt
but
he
had
a
cleverness
which
served
as
a
substitute
for
book
learning
and
he
seldom
failed
in
impressing
the
people
he
met
with
the
idea
that
he
gomez
de
montesma
was
no
ordinary
man
directly
after
dinner
the
preparations
for
an
immediate
start
began
very
much
to
the
disgust
of
skipper
and
crew
who
were
not
in
the
habit
of
working
after
dinner
but
montesma
cared
nothing
for
the
short
answers
of
the
captain
or
the
black
look
of
the
men
lesbia
wanted
to
learn
all
about
everything
the
name
of
every
sail
of
every
rope
she
stood
near
the
helmsman
a
slim
graceful
figure
in
a
white
gown
of
some
soft
material
with
never
a
jewel
or
a
flower
to
relieve
that
statuesque
simplicity
she
wore
no
hat
and
the
rich
chesnut
hair
was
rolled
in
a
loose
knot
at
the
back
of
the
small
head
montesma
came
to
her
every
now
and
then
to
explain
what
was
being
done
and
when
the
canvas
was
all
up
and
the
yacht
was
skimming
over
the
water
like
a
giant
swan
borne
by
the
current
of
some
vast
strong
river
he
came
and
stayed
by
her
side
and
they
two
sat
making
little
baby
sentences
in
spanish
he
as
teacher
and
she
as
pupil
with
no
one
near
them
but
the
sailors
the
owner
of
the
had
disappeared
mysteriously
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
sails
were
unfurled
and
lady
kirkbank
had
tottered
down
to
the
saloon
am
not
going
cabin
she
faltered
when
lesbia
remonstrated
with
her
going
saloon
sofa
lie
down
little
smithson
take
care
you
not
perceiving
that
smithson
had
vanished
be
quite
close
so
lesbia
and
don
gomez
were
alone
under
the
summer
stars
murmuring
little
bits
of
spanish
is
the
only
true
way
of
learning
a
language
he
said
are
a
delusion
it
was
a
very
delightful
and
easy
way
of
learning
at
any
rate
lesbia
reclined
in
her
bamboo
chair
and
fanned
herself
indolently
and
watched
the
shadowy
shores
of
the
island
cliff
and
hill
down
and
wooded
crest
flitting
past
her
like
and
her
lips
slowly
shaped
the
words
of
that
soft
lisping
language
so
simple
so
musical
a
language
made
for
lovers
and
for
song
one
would
think
it
was
wonderful
what
rapid
progress
lesbia
made
she
heard
a
church
clock
on
the
island
striking
and
asked
don
gomez
the
hour
he
said
surely
it
must
be
later
it
was
past
eight
before
we
began
dinner
and
we
have
been
sailing
for
ever
so
long
captain
kindly
tell
me
the
time
she
called
to
the
skipper
who
was
lolling
over
the
gunwale
near
the
foremast
smoking
a
meditative
pipe
my
lady
can
i
possibly
have
been
sitting
here
so
long
i
should
like
to
stay
on
deck
all
night
and
watch
the
sailing
but
i
must
really
go
and
take
care
of
poor
lady
kirkbank
i
am
afraid
she
is
not
very
well
had
a
somewhat
distracted
air
when
she
went
below
but
i
daresay
she
will
sleep
off
her
troubles
if
i
were
you
i
should
leave
her
to
herself
what
can
have
become
of
mr
smithson
have
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
it
is
with
smithson
as
with
poor
lady
kirkbank
you
mean
that
he
is
ill
on
a
calm
summer
night
sailing
over
a
sea
of
glass
the
owner
of
a
yacht
ignominious
for
poor
smithson
is
it
but
men
who
own
yachts
are
only
mortal
and
are
sometimes
wretched
sailors
smithson
is
feeble
on
that
point
as
i
know
of
old
was
it
rather
cruel
of
us
to
sail
his
yacht
are
meant
for
sailing
and
again
is
supposed
to
be
a
wholesome
exercise
both
good
nights
in
spanish
and
with
a
touch
of
tenderness
which
the
words
could
hardly
have
expressed
in
english
you
really
go
pleaded
montesma
holding
her
hand
just
a
thought
longer
than
he
had
ever
held
it
before
the
little
more
and
how
much
it
is
says
the
poet
and
truly
am
so
sorry
i
wish
you
could
have
stayed
on
deck
all
night
do
i
with
all
my
heart
this
calm
sea
under
the
starlit
sky
is
like
a
dream
of
heaven
is
very
nice
but
if
you
stayed
i
think
i
could
promise
you
considerable
variety
we
shall
have
a
tempest
before
morning
all
things
in
the
world
i
should
love
to
see
a
thunderstorm
at
sea
on
the
alert
then
and
captain
parkes
and
i
will
try
to
oblige
you
any
rate
you
have
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
sleep
i
shall
stay
with
lady
kirkbank
in
the
saloon
again
chapter
xxxix
in
storm
and
darkness
lesbia
found
lady
kirkbank
prostrate
on
a
low
divan
in
the
saloon
sleepless
and
very
cross
the
atmosphere
reeked
with
red
lavender
eau
de
cologne
and
brandy
which
latter
remedy
poor
georgie
had
taken
freely
in
her
agonies
kibble
the
faithful
grasmere
girl
sat
by
the
divan
fanning
the
sufferer
with
a
large
japanese
fan
rilboche
had
naturally
as
a
frenchwoman
succumbed
utterly
to
her
own
feelings
and
was
moaning
in
her
berth
wailing
out
every
now
and
then
that
she
would
never
have
taken
service
with
miladi
had
she
suspected
her
to
be
capable
of
such
cruelty
as
to
take
her
to
live
for
weeks
upon
the
sea
if
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
now
while
the
ocean
was
only
gently
stirred
what
would
it
be
if
the
tempest
should
really
come
can
you
be
thinking
of
staying
on
deck
all
night
with
those
men
exclaimed
lady
kirkbank
peevishly
is
hardly
respectable
she
would
have
been
still
more
inclined
to
object
had
she
known
that
lesbia
companion
had
been
man
rather
than
men
do
you
mean
by
all
night
lesbia
retorted
contemptuously
is
only
just
twelve
twelve
i
thought
we
were
close
upon
daylight
i
have
suffered
an
eternity
of
agony
am
very
sorry
you
should
be
ill
but
really
the
sea
has
been
so
deliciously
calm
believe
i
should
have
suffered
less
if
it
had
been
diabolically
rough
oh
that
monotonous
of
the
water
that
slow
heaving
of
the
boat
nothing
could
be
worse
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
for
don
gomez
says
we
are
likely
to
have
a
tempest
tempest
shrieked
georgie
let
him
stop
the
boat
this
instant
and
put
me
on
shore
tell
him
to
land
me
anywhere
on
the
needles
even
i
could
stop
at
the
lighthouse
till
morning
a
storm
at
sea
will
be
simply
my
death
lady
kirkbank
i
was
only
joking
said
lesbia
who
did
not
want
to
be
worried
by
her
chaperon
nervous
apprehensions
far
the
night
is
lovely
me
a
spoonful
more
brandy
my
good
creature
to
kibble
you
ought
never
to
have
brought
me
into
this
miserable
state
i
consented
to
staying
on
board
the
yacht
but
i
never
consented
to
sailing
on
her
will
soon
be
well
dear
lady
kirkbank
and
you
will
have
such
an
appetite
for
breakfast
morning
shall
we
be
at
breakfast
time
catherine
point
i
believe
just
half
way
round
the
island
we
are
not
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
groaned
georgie
they
were
now
in
the
open
channel
and
the
boat
dipped
and
rose
to
larger
billows
than
had
encountered
her
course
before
lady
kirkbank
lay
in
a
state
of
collapse
in
which
life
seemed
only
sustainable
by
occasional
teaspoonfuls
of
cognac
gently
tilted
down
her
throat
by
the
patient
kibble
lesbia
went
to
her
cabin
but
with
no
intention
of
remaining
there
she
was
firmly
convinced
that
the
storm
would
come
and
she
meant
to
be
on
deck
while
it
was
raging
what
harm
could
thunder
or
lightning
hail
or
rain
do
to
her
while
he
was
by
to
protect
her
he
would
be
busy
sailing
the
boat
perhaps
but
still
he
would
have
a
moment
now
and
then
in
which
to
think
of
her
and
care
for
her
yes
the
storm
was
coming
there
was
a
livid
look
upon
the
waters
and
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
with
heat
the
sky
to
windward
black
as
a
funeral
pall
lesbia
was
almost
fearless
yet
she
felt
a
thrill
of
awe
as
she
looked
into
that
dense
blackness
to
leeward
the
stars
were
still
visible
but
that
gigantic
mass
of
cloud
came
creeping
slowly
solemnly
over
the
sky
while
the
shadow
flitted
fast
across
the
water
swallowing
up
that
ghastly
electric
glare
lesbia
wrapped
herself
in
a
white
cashmere
de
and
stole
up
the
companion
montesma
was
working
at
the
ropes
with
his
own
hands
calling
directions
to
the
sailors
to
shorten
and
take
in
the
canvas
urging
them
to
increased
efforts
by
working
at
the
ropes
with
his
own
hands
springing
up
the
rigging
and
on
deck
flashing
backwards
and
forwards
amidst
the
rigging
like
a
being
of
supernatural
power
he
had
taken
off
his
jacket
and
was
clad
from
top
to
toe
in
white
save
for
that
streak
of
scarlet
which
tightly
girdled
his
waist
his
tall
flexible
form
perfect
in
line
as
a
greek
statue
of
hermes
stood
out
against
the
background
of
black
night
his
voice
with
its
tones
of
brief
imperious
command
the
proud
carriage
of
his
head
the
easy
grace
of
his
rapid
movements
all
proclaimed
the
man
born
to
rule
over
his
and
it
is
these
master
spirits
these
born
rulers
whom
women
instinctively
recognise
as
their
sovereign
lords
and
for
whom
women
count
no
sacrifice
too
costly
in
the
midst
of
his
activity
montesma
suddenly
saw
that
figure
standing
at
the
top
of
the
companion
and
flew
to
her
side
the
boat
was
pitching
heavily
dipping
into
the
trough
of
the
sea
at
an
angle
of
degrees
as
it
seemed
to
lesbia
ought
not
to
be
here
said
montesma
is
much
rougher
than
i
expected
am
not
afraid
she
answered
i
will
go
back
to
my
cabin
if
i
am
in
your
way
my
way
with
deepest
tenderness
you
are
in
my
way
for
i
shall
think
of
nothing
else
now
you
are
here
but
i
believe
we
have
done
all
that
need
be
done
to
the
yacht
and
i
can
take
care
of
you
till
the
storm
is
over
he
put
his
arm
round
her
as
the
stem
dipped
and
led
her
towards
the
stern
guiding
her
footsteps
supporting
her
as
her
light
figure
swayed
against
him
with
the
motion
of
the
boat
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
showed
him
her
face
as
they
stood
for
an
instant
leaning
against
each
other
his
arm
encircling
her
ah
what
deep
feeling
in
that
countenance
once
so
passionless
what
a
new
light
in
those
eyes
it
was
like
the
awakening
of
a
long
dormant
soul
he
took
the
helm
from
the
captain
and
stood
steering
the
vessel
and
calling
out
his
orders
with
lesbia
close
beside
him
holding
her
with
his
disengaged
arm
drawing
her
near
him
as
the
vessel
pitched
violently
drawing
her
nearer
still
when
they
shipped
a
sea
and
a
great
fountain
of
spray
enfolded
them
both
in
a
dense
cloud
of
salt
water
the
thunder
roared
and
rattled
as
if
it
began
and
ended
close
beside
them
forked
lightnings
zigzagged
amidst
the
rigging
sheet
lightning
enwrapped
those
two
in
a
luminous
atmosphere
revealing
faces
that
were
pale
with
passion
lips
that
trembled
with
emotion
there
were
but
scant
opportunity
for
speech
and
neither
of
these
two
felt
the
need
of
words
to
be
together
bound
nearer
to
each
other
than
they
had
ever
been
yet
than
they
might
ever
be
again
in
the
midst
of
thunder
and
lightning
and
dense
clouds
of
spray
this
was
enough
once
when
the
pitched
with
exceptional
fury
when
the
thunder
crashed
and
roared
loudest
lesbia
found
her
head
lying
on
montesma
breast
and
his
arms
round
her
his
lips
upon
her
face
she
did
not
wrench
herself
from
that
forbidden
embrace
she
let
those
lips
kiss
hers
as
never
mortal
man
had
kissed
her
before
but
an
instant
later
when
montesma
attention
was
distracted
by
his
duties
as
steersman
and
he
let
her
go
she
slipped
away
in
the
darkness
and
melted
from
his
sight
and
touch
like
a
modern
undine
he
dared
not
leave
the
helm
and
follow
her
then
he
sent
one
of
the
sailors
below
a
little
later
to
make
sure
that
she
was
safe
in
her
cabin
but
he
saw
her
no
more
that
night
the
storm
abated
soon
after
daybreak
and
the
morning
was
lovely
but
don
gomez
and
lady
lesbia
did
not
meet
again
till
the
church
bells
on
the
island
were
ringing
for
morning
service
and
then
the
lady
was
safe
under
the
wing
of
her
chaperon
with
her
affianced
husband
in
attendance
upon
her
at
the
breakfast
table
in
the
saloon
she
received
montesma
with
the
faintest
inclination
of
the
head
and
she
carefully
avoided
all
occasion
of
speech
with
him
during
the
leisurely
long
meal
she
was
as
white
as
her
muslin
gown
and
her
eyes
told
of
a
sleepless
night
she
talked
a
little
very
little
to
lady
kirkbank
and
smithson
to
the
spaniard
not
at
all
and
yet
montesma
was
in
no
manner
dashed
by
this
appearance
of
deep
offence
so
might
francesca
have
looked
the
morning
after
that
little
scene
over
the
book
yet
she
sacrificed
her
salvation
for
her
lover
all
the
same
it
was
a
familiar
stage
upon
the
journey
which
montesma
knew
by
heart
here
the
inclination
of
the
road
was
so
many
degrees
more
or
less
for
this
hill
you
are
commanded
to
put
on
an
extra
horse
at
this
stage
it
is
forbidden
to
go
more
than
eight
miles
an
hour
and
so
on
and
so
on
montesma
knew
every
inch
of
the
ground
he
put
on
a
melancholy
look
and
talked
very
little
he
had
been
on
deck
all
night
and
so
there
was
an
excuse
for
his
being
quiet
lady
kirkbank
related
her
impressions
of
the
storm
and
talked
enough
for
four
she
had
suffered
the
pangs
of
purgatory
but
her
natural
cheeriness
asserted
itself
and
she
made
no
moaning
about
past
agonies
which
had
exercised
a
really
delightful
influence
on
her
appetite
smithson
also
was
cheerful
he
had
paid
his
annual
tribute
to
neptune
and
might
hope
to
go
for
the
rest
of
the
season
i
had
stayed
on
deck
i
must
have
had
my
finger
in
the
pie
so
i
thought
it
better
to
go
below
and
get
a
good
night
rest
in
the
steward
cabin
he
said
not
caring
to
confess
his
sufferings
as
frankly
as
lady
kirkbank
admitted
hers
after
breakfast
which
was
prolonged
till
noon
montesma
asked
smithson
to
smoke
a
cigarette
on
deck
with
him
want
to
talk
to
you
on
a
rather
serious
matter
he
said
lesbia
heard
the
words
and
looked
up
with
a
frightened
glance
could
he
mean
to
attempt
anything
desperate
was
he
going
to
confess
the
fatal
truth
to
horace
smithson
to
tell
her
affianced
lover
that
she
was
untrue
to
her
bond
that
she
loved
him
montesma
as
fondly
as
he
loved
her
that
their
two
souls
had
mingled
like
two
flames
fanned
by
the
same
current
and
thence
had
risen
to
a
conflagration
which
must
end
in
ruin
if
she
were
not
set
free
to
follow
where
her
heart
had
gone
free
to
belong
to
that
man
whom
her
spirit
chose
for
lord
and
master
her
heart
leapt
at
the
hope
that
montesma
was
going
to
do
this
that
he
was
strong
enough
to
break
her
bonds
for
her
powerful
and
rich
enough
to
secure
her
a
brilliant
future
yet
this
last
consideration
which
hitherto
had
been
paramount
seemed
now
of
but
little
moment
to
be
with
to
belong
to
would
be
enough
for
bliss
albeit
that
in
such
a
choice
she
forfeited
all
that
she
had
ever
possessed
or
hoped
for
of
earthly
prosperity
adventurer
beggar
whatever
he
might
be
she
chose
him
and
loved
him
with
all
the
strength
of
a
weak
soul
newly
awakened
to
passionate
feeling
unhappily
for
lesbia
haselden
montesma
was
not
at
all
the
kind
of
man
to
take
so
direct
and
open
a
course
as
that
which
she
imagined
possible
his
business
with
smithson
was
of
quite
a
different
kind
do
you
know
that
you
have
an
utterly
incompetent
crew
he
said
gravely
when
they
two
were
standing
aft
lighting
their
cigarettes
i
do
not
the
men
are
all
experienced
sailors
and
the
captain
ranks
high
among
yachtsmen
yachtsmen
are
not
particularly
good
judges
of
sailors
i
tell
you
your
skipper
is
no
sailor
and
his
men
are
fools
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
the
would
have
gone
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
last
night
and
if
you
are
to
cross
to
malo
as
you
talked
of
doing
for
the
regatta
there
you
had
better
sack
these
men
and
let
me
get
you
a
south
american
crew
i
know
of
a
fellow
who
is
in
london
just
now
the
captain
of
a
rio
steamer
who
send
you
a
crew
of
picked
men
if
you
give
me
authority
to
telegraph
to
him
do
like
foreign
sailors
said
smithson
looking
perplexed
and
worried
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
wilkinson
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
consider
me
a
liar
go
to
the
bottom
your
own
way
ami
ce
pas
mon
affaire
said
montesma
turning
on
his
heel
and
leaving
his
friend
to
his
own
devices
had
he
pressed
the
point
smithson
would
have
suspected
him
of
some
evil
motive
and
would
have
been
resolute
in
his
resistance
but
as
he
said
no
more
about
it
smithson
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
he
was
no
sailor
himself
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
navigation
of
his
yacht
though
he
sometimes
pretended
to
sail
her
and
he
had
no
power
to
judge
of
his
skipper
capacity
or
his
men
seamanship
he
had
engaged
the
captain
wholly
on
the
strength
of
the
man
reputation
guaranteed
by
certain
certificates
which
seemed
to
mean
a
great
deal
but
after
all
such
certificates
might
mean
very
little
such
a
reputation
might
be
no
real
guarantee
the
sailors
had
been
engaged
by
the
captain
and
their
ruddy
faces
and
thoroughly
british
appearence
the
exquisite
cleanliness
which
they
maintained
in
every
detail
of
the
yacht
had
seemed
to
smithson
the
perfection
of
seamanship
but
it
was
not
the
less
true
that
the
cleanest
of
yachts
with
deck
of
spotless
whiteness
sails
of
unsullied
purity
brasses
shining
and
sparkling
like
gold
fresh
from
the
goldsmith
might
be
spiked
upon
a
rock
or
might
founder
on
a
or
heel
over
under
too
much
canvas
smithson
was
inclined
to
suspect
any
proposition
of
montesma
yet
he
was
not
the
less
disturbed
in
mind
by
the
assertion
the
day
wore
on
and
the
yacht
sailed
merrily
over
a
summer
sea
smithson
fidgeted
about
the
deck
uneasily
watching
every
movement
of
the
sailors
no
boat
could
be
sailing
better
as
it
seemed
to
him
but
in
such
weather
and
over
such
waters
any
boat
must
needs
go
easily
it
was
in
the
blackness
of
night
amidst
the
fury
of
the
storm
that
montesma
opinion
had
been
formed
smithson
began
to
think
that
his
friend
was
right
the
sailors
had
honest
countenances
but
they
looked
horribly
stupid
could
men
with
such
vacuous
grins
such
an
air
of
imbecile
be
capable
of
acting
wisely
in
any
terrible
crisis
could
they
have
nerve
and
readiness
quickness
decision
all
those
grand
qualites
which
are
needed
by
the
seaman
who
has
to
contend
with
the
fury
of
the
elements
smithson
and
his
guests
had
breakfasted
too
late
for
the
possibility
of
luncheon
they
were
in
cowes
roads
by
one
a
fleet
of
yachts
had
arrived
during
their
absence
and
the
scene
was
full
of
life
and
gaiety
lady
lesbia
held
a
at
the
afternoon
tea
and
had
a
crowd
of
her
old
admirers
around
her
adorers
whose
presence
in
no
wise
disturbed
horace
smithson
peace
he
would
have
been
content
that
his
wife
should
go
through
life
with
a
herd
of
such
worshippers
following
in
her
footsteps
he
knew
the
aimless
innocence
the
almost
infantine
simplicity
of
the
typical
johnnie
chappie
petit
creve
call
him
by
what
name
you
will
from
these
he
feared
no
evil
but
in
that
one
follower
who
gave
no
outward
token
of
his
worship
he
dreaded
peril
it
was
montesma
he
watched
while
dragoons
with
hair
and
imbecile
youths
with
heads
rigid
in
collars
were
hanging
about
lady
lesbia
low
bamboo
chair
and
administering
obsequiously
to
the
small
necessities
of
the
it
was
while
this
business
was
going
on
that
smithson
took
the
opportunity
of
setting
his
mind
at
rest
were
it
possible
as
to
the
merits
of
captain
wilkinson
among
his
visitors
this
afternoon
there
was
the
owner
of
three
or
four
racing
yachts
a
man
renowned
for
his
victories
at
home
and
abroad
think
you
knew
something
of
my
captain
wilkinson
before
i
engaged
him
said
smithson
with
assumed
carelessness
know
every
skipper
on
board
every
boat
in
the
squadron
answered
his
friend
good
fellow
wilkinson
thoroughly
honest
fellow
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
that
but
how
about
his
seamanship
his
certificates
were
wonderfully
good
but
they
are
not
everything
my
dear
fellow
cried
the
other
are
next
to
nothing
but
i
believe
wilkinson
is
a
tolerable
sailor
this
was
not
encouraging
has
never
been
unlucky
i
believe
dear
smithson
you
are
a
great
authority
in
the
city
but
you
are
not
very
well
up
in
the
records
of
the
yachting
world
or
you
would
know
that
your
captain
wilkinson
was
skipper
on
the
when
she
ran
aground
on
the
chesil
bank
coming
home
from
cherbourg
regatta
fifteen
lives
lost
and
the
yacht
in
less
than
half
an
hour
ground
to
powder
that
was
rather
a
bad
case
i
remember
for
though
it
was
a
tempestuous
night
the
accident
would
never
have
happened
if
wilkinson
had
not
mistaken
the
lights
so
you
see
his
trinity
house
papers
did
prevent
his
going
wrong
good
heavens
this
was
the
strongest
confirmation
of
montesma
charge
the
man
was
a
stupid
man
an
incapable
man
a
man
to
whose
intelligence
and
care
human
life
should
never
be
trusted
a
fig
for
his
honesty
what
would
honesty
be
worth
in
a
hurricane
off
the
chesil
beach
what
would
honesty
serve
a
ship
spitted
on
the
jailors
off
jersey
montesma
was
right
if
the
was
to
make
a
trip
to
malo
she
must
be
navigated
by
competent
men
horace
smithson
hated
foreign
sailors
ruffians
with
flashing
black
eyes
which
seemed
to
threaten
murder
did
you
but
say
a
rough
word
to
them
sleek
scoundrels
with
in
their
girdles
ready
for
mutiny
but
after
all
life
is
worth
too
much
to
be
risked
for
a
prejudice
a
sentiment
perhaps
that
malo
business
might
be
avoided
and
then
there
need
be
no
change
in
captain
or
crew
the
yacht
must
be
safe
enough
lying
at
anchor
in
the
roadstead
when
the
visitors
had
departed
and
smithson
was
reposefully
enjoying
his
tea
by
lady
lesbia
side
he
approached
the
subject
you
really
care
about
crossing
to
malo
after
this
really
prefer
the
idea
to
ryde
exclaimed
lesbia
quickly
would
only
be
cowes
ever
again
a
lesser
cowes
and
i
thought
when
you
first
proposed
it
that
the
plan
was
rather
stupid
though
i
did
not
want
to
be
uncivil
and
say
so
but
i
was
delighted
with
don
gomez
de
montesma
amendment
substituting
malo
for
ryde
in
the
first
place
the
trip
across
will
be
delicious
lady
kirkbank
gave
a
faint
groan
in
the
second
place
i
am
dying
to
see
brittany
doubt
if
you
will
highly
appreciate
malo
it
is
a
town
of
many
and
various
smells
i
want
to
smell
those
foreign
smells
of
which
one
hears
much
at
least
it
is
an
experience
we
need
not
be
on
shore
any
longer
than
we
like
and
i
want
to
see
that
fine
rocky
coast
and
chateaubriand
tomb
on
the
so
nice
to
be
buried
in
that
way
you
have
set
your
heart
on
going
to
malo
and
would
not
like
any
change
in
our
plan
change
will
be
simply
detestable
answered
lesbia
all
the
more
decidedly
since
she
suspected
a
desire
for
change
on
the
part
of
smithson
she
was
in
no
amiable
humour
this
afternoon
all
her
nerves
seemed
strained
to
their
utmost
tension
she
was
irritated
tremulous
with
nervous
excitement
inclined
to
hate
everybody
horace
smithson
most
of
all
in
her
cabin
a
little
later
on
when
she
was
changing
her
gown
for
dinner
and
kibble
was
somewhat
slow
and
clumsy
in
the
lacing
of
the
bodice
she
wrenched
herself
from
the
girl
hands
flung
herself
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
passionate
tears
god
that
i
were
on
one
of
those
islands
in
the
caribbean
sea
an
island
where
europeans
never
come
where
i
might
lie
down
among
the
poisonous
tropical
flowers
and
sleep
the
rest
of
my
days
away
i
am
sick
to
death
of
my
life
here
of
the
yacht
the
people
everything
air
is
too
relaxing
lady
lesbia
the
girl
murmured
soothingly
you
did
have
your
natural
rest
last
night
shall
i
get
you
a
nice
strong
cup
of
tea
no
i
have
been
living
upon
tea
for
the
last
hours
i
have
eaten
nothing
my
mouth
is
parched
and
burning
oh
kibble
flinging
her
head
upon
the
girl
buxom
arm
and
letting
it
rest
there
a
happy
creature
you
are
not
a
care
not
a
care
sure
you
ca
have
any
cares
lady
lesbia
said
kibble
with
an
incredulous
smile
trying
to
smooth
the
disordered
hair
anxious
to
make
haste
with
the
unfinished
toilet
for
it
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
eight
am
full
of
care
i
am
in
debt
horribly
in
debt
getting
deeper
and
deeper
every
day
and
i
am
going
to
sell
myself
to
the
only
man
who
can
pay
my
debts
and
give
me
fine
houses
and
finery
like
this
plucking
at
the
de
gown
with
its
flossy
fringe
its
delicate
lace
a
marvel
of
artistic
expenditure
a
garment
which
looked
simplicity
itself
and
yet
was
so
cleverly
contrived
as
to
cost
guineas
the
greatest
effects
in
it
required
to
be
studied
with
a
microscope
surely
dear
lady
lesbia
you
wo
marry
smithson
if
you
do
love
him
you
suppose
love
has
anything
to
do
with
marriages
in
society
lady
lesbia
it
would
be
so
unkind
to
him
so
cruel
to
yourself
to
myself
yes
i
am
cruel
to
myself
i
had
the
chance
of
happiness
a
year
ago
and
i
lost
it
i
have
the
chance
of
happiness
now
yes
of
consummate
bliss
and
have
the
courage
to
snatch
at
it
take
off
this
horrid
gown
kibble
my
head
is
splitting
i
sha
go
to
dinner
lady
lesbia
you
are
treading
on
the
pearl
embroidery
remonstrated
poor
kibble
as
lesbia
kicked
the
new
gown
from
under
her
feet
does
it
matter
she
exclaimed
with
a
bitter
little
laugh
has
not
been
paid
for
perhaps
it
never
will
be
the
dinner
was
silent
and
gloomy
it
was
as
if
a
star
had
been
suddenly
blotted
out
of
the
sky
smithson
ordinarily
so
hospitable
had
been
too
much
disturbed
in
mind
to
ask
any
of
his
friends
to
stay
to
dinner
so
there
were
only
lady
kirkbank
who
was
too
tired
to
be
lively
and
montesma
who
was
inclined
to
be
thoughtful
lesbia
absence
and
the
idea
that
she
was
ill
gave
the
feast
almost
a
funereal
air
after
dinner
smithson
and
montesma
sat
on
deck
smoking
their
cigars
and
lazily
watching
the
lights
on
sea
and
the
lights
on
shore
these
brilliant
in
the
foreground
those
dim
in
the
distance
can
telegraph
to
your
rio
janeiro
friend
morning
if
you
like
said
smithson
presently
tell
him
to
send
a
skipper
and
crew
lady
lesbia
has
made
up
her
mind
to
see
malo
regatta
and
with
such
a
sacred
charge
i
ca
be
too
careful
wire
before
eight
answered
montesma
have
decided
wisely
your
respectable
english
wilkinson
is
an
excellent
man
but
nothing
would
surprise
me
less
than
his
reducing
your
to
matchwood
in
the
next
gale
chapter
xl
a
note
of
alarm
that
strange
scene
in
the
old
house
at
fellside
made
a
profound
impression
upon
lord
hartfield
he
tried
to
disguise
his
trouble
and
did
all
in
his
power
to
seem
gay
and
at
perfect
ease
in
his
company
but
his
mind
was
full
of
anxiety
and
mary
loved
him
too
well
to
be
for
a
moment
in
doubt
as
to
his
feelings
is
something
wrong
jack
she
said
while
they
were
breakfasting
at
a
table
in
the
verandah
with
the
lake
and
the
bills
in
front
of
them
and
the
sweet
morning
air
around
them
try
to
talk
and
to
be
lively
but
there
is
a
little
perpendicular
wrinkle
in
your
forehead
which
i
know
as
well
as
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
that
little
line
means
worry
i
used
to
see
it
in
the
old
days
when
you
were
breaking
your
heart
for
lesbia
why
can
not
you
be
frank
and
confide
in
me
it
is
your
duty
sir
as
my
husband
it
my
duty
to
halve
my
burdens
as
well
as
my
joys
how
do
i
know
if
those
girlish
shoulders
are
strong
enough
to
bear
the
weight
of
them
can
bear
anything
you
can
bear
and
i
wo
be
cheated
out
of
my
share
in
your
worries
if
you
were
obliged
to
have
a
tooth
out
i
would
have
one
out
too
for
company
hope
the
dentist
would
be
too
conscientious
to
allow
that
me
your
trouble
hartfield
she
said
earnestly
leaning
across
the
table
bringing
her
grave
intelligent
face
near
to
him
they
were
quite
alone
he
and
she
the
servants
had
done
their
ministering
behind
them
there
was
the
empty
in
front
of
them
the
sunlit
panorama
of
lake
and
hill
there
could
not
be
a
safer
place
for
telling
secrets
me
what
it
is
that
worries
you
mary
pleaded
again
will
dear
after
all
perfect
trust
is
the
best
nay
it
is
your
due
for
you
are
brave
enough
and
true
enough
to
be
trusted
with
secrets
that
mean
life
and
death
in
a
word
then
mary
the
cause
of
my
trouble
is
that
old
man
we
saw
the
other
night
uncle
you
really
believe
that
he
is
steadman
uncle
grandmother
told
me
so
answered
mary
reddening
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
to
this
girl
who
was
the
soul
of
truth
there
was
deepest
shame
in
the
idea
that
her
kinswoman
the
woman
whom
of
all
the
world
she
most
owed
reverence
and
honour
could
be
deemed
capable
of
falsehood
you
think
my
grandmother
would
tell
me
an
untruth
do
not
believe
that
man
is
a
poor
dependent
an
old
kinsman
sheltered
and
cared
for
in
this
house
for
charity
sake
forgive
me
mary
if
i
doubt
the
word
of
one
you
love
but
there
are
positions
in
life
in
which
a
man
must
judge
for
himself
would
steadman
kinsman
be
lodged
as
that
old
man
is
lodged
would
he
talk
as
that
old
man
talks
and
last
and
greatest
perplexity
of
all
would
he
possess
a
treasure
of
gold
and
jewels
which
must
be
worth
many
thousands
you
can
not
know
for
certain
that
those
things
are
valuable
they
may
be
rubbish
that
this
poor
old
man
has
scraped
together
and
hoarded
for
years
glass
jewels
bought
at
country
fairs
those
rouleaux
may
contain
lead
or
coppers
do
not
think
so
mary
the
stones
had
all
the
brilliancy
of
valuable
gems
and
then
there
were
others
in
the
finest
filagree
settings
goldsmith
work
which
bore
the
stamp
of
an
eastern
world
take
my
word
for
it
that
treasure
came
from
india
and
it
must
have
been
brought
to
england
by
lord
maulevrier
it
may
have
existed
all
these
years
without
your
grandmother
knowledge
that
is
quite
possible
but
it
seems
to
me
impossible
that
such
wealth
should
be
within
the
knowledge
and
the
power
of
a
pauper
lunatic
if
that
unhappy
old
man
is
not
a
relation
of
steadman
supported
here
by
my
grandmother
benevolence
who
can
he
be
and
why
is
he
here
asked
mary
molly
dear
these
are
two
questions
which
i
can
not
answer
and
which
yet
ought
to
be
answered
somehow
since
that
night
i
have
felt
as
if
there
were
a
dark
cloud
lowering
over
this
house
a
cloud
almost
as
terrible
in
its
menace
of
danger
as
the
forshadowing
of
fate
in
a
greek
legend
for
your
sake
for
the
honour
of
your
race
for
my
own
as
your
husband
i
feel
that
this
mystery
ought
to
be
solved
and
all
dark
things
made
light
before
your
grandmother
death
when
she
is
gone
the
to
the
past
will
be
lost
she
will
be
spared
for
many
years
i
hope
spared
to
sympathise
with
my
happiness
and
with
lesbia
my
dearest
girl
we
can
not
hope
that
the
thread
of
her
life
is
worn
very
thin
it
may
snap
at
any
moment
you
can
not
look
seriously
in
your
grandmother
face
and
yet
delude
yourself
with
the
hope
that
she
has
years
of
life
before
her
will
be
very
hard
to
part
just
as
she
has
begun
to
care
for
me
said
mary
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
such
partings
are
hard
and
your
grandmother
life
has
been
so
lonely
and
joyless
that
the
memory
of
it
must
always
have
a
touch
of
pain
one
can
not
say
of
her
as
we
can
of
the
happy
she
has
lived
her
life
all
things
have
been
given
to
her
and
she
falls
asleep
at
the
close
of
a
long
and
glorious
day
for
some
reason
which
i
can
not
understand
lady
maulevrier
life
has
been
a
prolonged
sacrifice
has
always
given
us
to
understand
that
she
was
fond
of
fellside
and
that
this
secluded
life
suited
her
said
mary
meditatively
can
not
help
doubting
her
sincerity
on
that
point
lady
maulevrier
is
too
clever
a
woman
and
forgive
me
dear
if
i
add
too
worldly
a
woman
to
be
content
to
live
out
of
the
world
the
bird
must
have
chafed
its
breast
against
the
bars
of
the
cage
many
and
many
a
time
when
you
thought
that
all
was
peace
be
sure
mary
that
your
grandmother
had
a
powerful
motive
for
spending
all
her
days
in
this
place
and
i
can
but
think
that
the
old
man
we
saw
the
other
night
had
some
part
in
that
motive
do
you
remember
telling
me
of
her
ladyship
vehement
anger
when
she
heard
you
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
her
pensioner
she
was
very
angry
mary
answered
with
a
troubled
look
never
saw
her
so
angry
she
was
almost
beside
herself
said
the
harshest
things
to
me
talked
as
if
i
had
done
some
dreadful
mischief
she
have
been
so
moved
do
you
think
unless
there
was
some
fatal
secret
involved
in
that
man
presence
here
hardly
know
what
to
think
tell
me
everything
what
is
it
that
you
fear
what
is
it
that
you
suspect
tell
you
my
fears
and
suspicions
is
to
tell
you
a
family
secret
that
has
been
kept
from
you
out
of
kindness
all
the
years
of
your
life
and
i
hardly
think
i
could
bring
myself
to
that
if
i
did
not
know
what
the
world
is
and
how
many
friends
lady
hartfield
will
meet
in
society
ready
to
tell
her
by
hints
and
innuendoes
that
her
grandfather
the
governor
of
madras
came
back
to
england
under
a
cloud
of
disgrace
poor
grandfather
how
dreadful
exclaimed
mary
pale
with
pity
and
shame
he
deserve
his
disgrace
poor
unhappy
creature
or
was
he
the
victim
of
false
accusation
can
hardly
tell
you
that
mary
any
more
than
i
can
tell
whether
warren
hastings
deserved
the
abuse
that
was
wreaked
upon
him
at
one
time
or
the
acquittal
that
gave
the
lie
to
his
slanderers
in
after
years
the
events
occurred
forty
years
ago
the
story
was
only
half
known
then
and
like
all
such
stories
formed
the
basis
for
every
kind
of
exaggeration
and
perversion
maulevrier
know
faltered
mary
knows
all
that
is
known
by
the
general
public
and
no
more
you
have
married
the
granddaughter
of
a
disgraced
man
said
mary
with
a
piteous
look
you
know
when
you
married
me
much
as
i
know
now
dear
love
if
you
had
been
jonathan
granddaughter
you
would
have
been
just
as
dear
to
me
i
married
dearest
i
love
i
believe
in
all
the
grandfathers
in
christendom
would
not
shake
my
faith
by
one
tittle
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
sobbed
upon
his
breast
but
sweet
as
this
assurance
of
his
love
was
to
her
she
was
not
the
less
stricken
by
shame
at
the
thought
of
possible
infamy
in
the
past
a
shameful
memory
for
ever
brooding
over
her
name
in
the
present
never
forgets
a
scandal
she
said
have
heard
maulevrier
say
that
has
a
long
memory
for
other
people
sins
but
it
only
avenges
its
own
wrongs
give
the
wicked
fairy
society
a
bad
dinner
or
leave
her
out
of
your
invitation
list
for
a
ball
and
she
will
twit
you
with
the
crimes
or
the
misfortunes
of
a
remote
ancestor
she
will
go
about
talking
of
your
grandfather
the
leper
or
your
great
aunt
who
ran
away
with
her
footman
but
so
long
as
the
wicked
fairy
gets
all
she
wants
out
of
you
she
cares
not
a
straw
for
the
misdeeds
of
past
generations
he
spoke
lightly
laughingly
almost
and
then
he
ordered
the
dogcart
to
be
brought
round
immediately
and
he
drove
mary
across
the
hills
towards
langdale
to
bring
the
colour
back
to
her
blanched
cheeks
he
brought
her
home
in
time
to
give
her
grandmother
an
hour
for
before
luncheon
while
he
walked
up
and
down
the
terrace
below
lady
maulevrier
windows
meditating
the
course
he
was
to
take
he
was
to
leave
westmoreland
next
day
to
take
his
place
in
the
house
of
lords
during
the
last
important
debate
of
the
session
he
made
up
his
mind
that
before
he
left
he
would
seek
an
interview
with
lady
maulevrier
and
boldly
ask
her
to
explain
the
mystery
of
that
old
presence
at
fellside
he
was
her
kinsman
by
marriage
and
he
had
sworn
to
honour
her
and
to
care
for
her
as
a
son
and
as
a
son
he
would
urge
her
to
confide
in
him
to
unburden
her
conscience
of
any
dark
secret
and
to
make
the
crooked
things
straight
before
she
was
called
away
while
he
was
forecasting
this
interview
meeting
imaginary
objections
arguing
points
which
might
have
to
be
argued
a
servant
came
out
to
him
with
an
ochre
envelope
on
a
little
silver
tray
that
envelope
which
seems
always
a
presage
of
trouble
great
or
small
maulevrier
albany
to
lord
hartfield
fellside
grasmere
god
sake
come
to
me
at
once
i
am
in
great
trouble
not
on
my
own
account
but
about
a
relation
a
relation
except
his
grandmother
and
his
two
sisters
maulevrier
had
no
relations
for
whom
he
cared
a
straw
this
message
must
have
relation
to
lesbia
was
she
ill
dying
the
victim
of
some
fatal
accident
runaway
horses
boat
upset
train
smashed
there
was
something
and
maulevrier
appealed
to
his
nearest
and
best
friend
there
was
no
withstanding
such
an
appeal
it
must
be
answered
and
immediately
lord
hartfield
went
into
the
library
and
wrote
his
reply
message
which
consisted
of
six
words
to
you
by
first
train
the
next
train
left
windermere
at
three
there
was
just
time
to
get
a
fresh
horse
put
in
the
dogcart
and
a
gladstone
bag
packed
chapter
xli
privileged
information
lord
hartfield
did
not
arrive
at
euston
square
until
near
eleven
at
night
a
hansom
deposited
him
at
the
entrance
to
the
albany
just
as
the
clock
of
james
church
chimed
the
hour
he
found
only
maulevrier
valet
his
lordship
had
waited
indoors
all
the
evening
and
had
only
gone
out
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
he
had
gone
to
the
cerberus
and
begged
that
lord
hartfield
would
be
kind
enough
to
follow
him
there
lord
hartfield
was
not
fond
of
the
cerberus
and
indeed
deemed
that
lively
place
of
rendezvous
a
very
dangerous
sphere
for
his
friend
maulevrier
but
in
the
face
of
maulevrier
telegram
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
so
he
walked
across
piccadilly
and
down
james
street
to
the
fashionable
little
club
where
the
men
were
dropping
in
after
the
theatres
and
dinners
and
where
sheafs
of
bank
notes
were
being
exchanged
for
those
various
coloured
counters
which
represented
divers
values
from
the
respectable
to
the
modest
maulevrier
was
in
the
first
room
hartfield
looked
into
standing
behind
some
men
who
were
playing
something
like
friendship
he
exclaimed
when
he
saw
lord
hartfield
and
then
he
hooked
his
arm
through
his
friend
and
led
him
off
to
the
dining
room
and
have
some
supper
old
fellow
he
said
i
can
tell
you
my
troubles
while
you
are
eating
it
james
bring
us
a
grill
and
a
lobster
and
a
bottle
of
mumms
number
you
know
my
lord
to
find
you
in
this
den
maulevrier
said
lord
hartfield
touched
a
card
have
done
half
an
hour
punting
this
season
but
it
a
kind
of
habit
with
me
to
wander
in
here
now
and
then
i
know
so
many
of
the
members
one
poor
devil
lost
nine
thousand
one
night
last
week
rather
rough
upon
him
was
it
all
ready
money
at
this
shop
do
you
know
god
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
now
maulevrier
what
is
wrong
and
with
whom
is
wrong
and
with
my
sister
lesbia
heavens
what
do
you
mean
this
that
there
is
a
fellow
after
her
whose
very
name
means
ruin
to
women
a
adventurer
reckless
handsome
a
gambler
seducer
duellist
the
man
she
is
to
marry
seems
to
have
neither
nous
nor
spunk
to
defend
her
everybody
at
goodwood
saw
the
game
that
was
being
played
everybody
at
cowes
is
watching
the
cards
betting
on
the
result
yes
great
god
the
men
at
the
squadron
club
are
staking
their
money
upon
my
sister
character
even
monkeys
that
she
bolts
with
montesma
five
to
three
against
the
marriage
with
smithson
ever
coming
off
this
true
is
as
true
as
your
marriage
with
molly
as
true
as
your
loyalty
to
me
i
was
told
of
it
all
this
morning
at
the
haute
gomme
by
a
man
i
can
rely
upon
a
really
good
fellow
who
would
not
leave
me
in
the
dark
about
my
sister
danger
when
all
the
in
pall
mall
were
sniggering
about
it
my
first
impulse
was
to
take
the
train
for
cowes
but
then
i
knew
if
i
went
alone
i
should
let
my
temper
get
the
better
of
me
i
should
knock
somebody
down
throw
somebody
out
of
the
window
make
a
devil
of
a
scene
and
this
would
be
fatal
for
lesbia
i
wanted
your
counsel
your
cool
head
your
steady
not
a
step
forward
without
jack
i
said
to
myself
so
i
bolted
off
and
sent
that
telegram
it
relieved
my
feeling
a
little
but
i
had
a
wretched
day
bring
me
a
bradshaw
or
an
a
b
c
said
lord
hartfield
he
had
eaten
nothing
but
a
biscuit
since
breakfast
but
he
was
ready
to
go
off
at
once
supperless
if
there
were
a
train
to
carry
him
unluckily
there
was
no
train
the
mail
had
started
nothing
till
seven
next
morning
your
supper
old
fellow
said
maulevrier
all
the
danger
may
not
be
so
desperate
as
i
fancied
this
morning
slander
is
the
favourite
amusement
of
the
age
we
live
in
we
must
allow
a
margin
for
exaggeration
very
liberal
margin
answered
hartfield
doubt
the
man
who
warned
you
meant
honestly
but
this
scandal
may
have
grown
out
of
the
merest
trifles
the
feebleness
of
the
masher
brain
is
only
exceeded
by
the
foulness
of
the
masher
tongue
i
daresay
this
rumour
about
lady
lesbia
has
its
beginning
and
end
among
the
masher
species
hope
so
but
i
have
seen
those
two
together
i
met
them
at
victoria
one
evening
after
goodwood
old
kirkbank
was
shuffling
on
ahead
carrying
smithson
with
her
absorbing
his
attention
by
fussification
about
her
carriage
lesbia
and
that
cuban
devil
were
in
the
rear
they
looked
as
if
they
had
all
the
world
to
themselves
faust
and
marguerite
in
the
garden
were
not
in
it
for
the
expression
of
intense
absorbing
feeling
compared
with
those
two
i
not
an
intellectual
party
but
i
know
something
of
human
nature
and
i
know
when
a
man
and
woman
are
in
love
with
each
other
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
never
has
been
that
never
can
be
hidden
you
say
this
montesma
is
a
dangerous
man
we
must
lose
no
time
when
we
are
on
the
spot
it
will
be
easy
to
find
out
the
truth
and
it
will
be
your
duty
if
there
be
danger
to
warn
lesbia
and
her
future
husband
would
much
rather
shoot
the
cuban
said
maulevrier
never
knew
much
good
come
of
a
warning
in
such
a
case
it
generally
precipitates
matters
if
i
could
play
with
him
at
the
club
find
him
sporting
an
extra
king
throw
my
cards
in
his
face
and
accept
his
challenge
for
an
exchange
of
shots
on
the
sands
beyond
cherbourg
there
would
be
something
like
satisfaction
say
the
man
is
a
gambler
says
something
worse
of
him
report
says
he
is
a
cheat
must
not
be
dependent
upon
society
gossip
replied
lord
hartfield
have
an
idea
maulevrier
the
more
we
know
about
this
man
montesma
i
think
you
called
him
de
montesma
more
fully
we
are
acquainted
with
don
gomez
de
antecedents
the
better
we
shall
be
able
to
cope
with
him
if
we
come
to
it
too
late
to
start
for
cowes
but
it
is
not
too
late
to
do
something
fitzpatrick
the
spent
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
south
america
he
is
a
very
old
friend
knew
my
father
and
i
can
venture
to
knock
at
his
door
after
midnight
all
the
more
as
i
know
he
is
a
he
is
very
likely
to
enlighten
us
about
your
cuban
hidalgo
shall
finish
your
supper
before
i
let
you
stir
after
that
you
may
do
what
you
like
i
was
always
a
child
in
your
hands
jack
whether
it
was
climbing
a
mountain
or
crossing
the
fall
i
consider
the
business
in
your
hands
now
i
go
with
you
wherever
you
like
and
do
what
you
tell
me
when
you
want
me
to
kick
anybody
or
fight
anybody
you
can
give
me
the
office
and
i
do
it
i
know
that
interests
are
safe
in
your
hands
you
once
cared
very
much
for
her
you
are
her
now
and
next
to
me
you
are
her
natural
protector
taking
into
account
that
her
future
husband
is
a
cad
and
does
score
me
at
waterloo
at
ten
minutes
to
seven
morning
and
we
go
down
to
cowes
together
i
off
to
find
fitzpatrick
good
night
so
they
parted
lord
hartfield
walked
across
the
park
to
great
george
street
where
fitzpatrick
had
chambers
of
a
character
on
the
first
floor
of
a
old
house
spacious
gloomy
without
and
within
walls
sombre
with
the
subdued
colouring
of
decorations
half
a
century
old
the
lighted
windows
of
those
rooms
told
lord
hartfield
that
he
was
not
too
late
he
rang
the
bell
which
was
answered
with
the
briefest
delay
by
a
clerk
who
had
been
taking
shorthand
notes
for
fitzpatrick
great
book
upon
free
trade
the
clerk
looked
sleepy
but
his
employer
had
as
brisk
an
air
as
if
he
were
just
beginning
the
day
although
he
had
been
working
without
intermission
since
nine
that
evening
and
had
done
a
long
work
before
dinner
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
spacious
unluxurious
room
half
office
half
library
smoking
a
cigar
upon
a
large
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
stood
two
powerful
reading
lamps
with
green
shades
illuminating
a
chaotic
mass
of
books
and
pamphlets
heaped
and
scattered
all
over
the
table
save
just
on
that
spot
between
the
two
lamps
which
accommodated
fitzpatrick
blotting
pad
and
inkpot
a
pewter
inkpot
which
held
about
a
pint
d
do
hartfield
glad
you
looked
me
up
at
last
said
the
irishman
as
if
a
midnight
call
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
come
from
the
house
i
just
come
from
westmoreland
i
thought
i
should
find
you
among
those
everlasting
books
of
yours
late
as
it
is
can
i
have
a
few
words
alone
with
you
morgan
you
can
go
away
for
a
bit
sir
well
yes
i
suppose
it
late
you
look
sleepy
i
should
have
been
glad
to
finish
the
chapter
on
beetroot
sugar
but
it
may
stand
over
for
the
morning
be
sure
you
early
sir
the
clerk
responded
with
a
faint
sigh
he
was
paid
handsomely
for
late
hours
liberally
rewarded
for
his
shorthand
services
and
yet
he
wished
the
great
fitzpatrick
had
not
been
quite
so
industrious
my
dear
hartfield
what
can
i
do
for
you
asked
fitzpatrick
when
the
clerk
had
gone
can
see
by
your
face
that
you
something
serious
in
hand
can
i
help
you
can
i
believe
in
a
very
material
way
you
were
years
in
spanish
america
more
than
less
there
and
everywhere
there
is
a
city
in
south
america
that
i
have
not
lived
in
for
something
between
a
day
and
a
year
know
something
about
most
men
of
any
mark
in
that
part
of
the
world
i
conclude
was
my
business
to
know
men
of
all
kinds
i
had
my
mission
from
the
spanish
government
i
was
engaged
to
examine
the
condition
of
commerce
throughout
the
colony
the
working
of
protection
as
against
free
trade
and
so
on
strange
that
cuba
the
last
place
to
foster
the
slave
trade
was
of
all
spots
of
the
earth
the
first
to
carry
principles
into
practical
effect
long
before
they
were
recognised
in
any
european
country
to
me
that
you
should
speak
of
cuba
so
soon
after
my
coming
in
answered
lord
hartfield
am
here
to
ask
you
to
help
me
to
find
out
the
antecedents
of
a
man
who
hails
from
that
island
ought
to
know
something
about
him
whoever
he

fitzpatrick
briskly
spent
six
months
in
cuba
not
very
long
before
my
return
to
england
cuba
is
one
of
my
freshest
memories
and
i
have
a
pretty
tight
memory
for
facts
names
and
figures
never
could
remember
two
lines
of
poetry
in
my
life
you
ever
hear
of
or
meet
with
a
man
called
montesma
gomez
de
montesma
have
stopped
a
month
in
havana
without
hearing
something
about
that
gentleman
answered
fitzpatrick
hope
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
and
that
you
have
not
lent
him
money
but
i
want
to
know
all
you
can
tell
me
about
him
shall
have
it
in
black
and
white
out
of
my
cuban
replied
the
other
unlocking
a
drawer
in
the
official
table
always
take
notes
of
anything
worth
recording
on
the
spot
a
man
is
a
fool
who
trusts
to
memory
where
personal
character
is
at
stake
montesma
is
as
well
known
at
havana
as
the
morro
fort
or
the
tacon
theatre
i
have
heard
stories
enough
about
him
to
fill
a
big
volume
but
all
the
facts
recorded
there
striking
the
morocco
cover
of
the
been
thoroughly
sifted
i
can
vouch
for
them
he
looked
at
the
index
found
the
page
and
handed
the
book
to
lord
hartfield
for
yourself
he
said
quietly
lord
hartfield
read
three
or
four
pages
of
plain
statement
as
to
various
adventures
by
sea
and
land
in
which
gomez
de
montesma
had
figured
and
the
reputation
which
he
bore
in
cuba
and
on
the
main
can
vouch
for
this
he
said
at
last
after
a
long
silence
every
syllable
story
of
his
marriage
truth
i
knew
the
lady
the
rest
true
thousand
thanks
i
know
now
upon
what
ground
i
stand
i
have
to
save
an
innocent
girl
from
the
clutches
of
a
consummate
scoundrel
him
and
shoot
her
too
if
there
no
better
way
of
saving
her
it
will
be
an
act
of
mercy
said
fitzpatrick
without
hesitation
chapter
xlii
it
be
while
lord
hartfield
sat
in
his
friend
office
in
great
george
street
reading
the
life
story
of
gomez
de
montesma
told
with
the
cruel
precision
and
the
unvarnished
language
of
a
criminal
indictment
the
hero
of
that
history
was
gliding
round
the
spacious
ballroom
of
the
cowes
club
with
lady
lesbia
haselden
head
almost
reclining
on
his
shoulder
her
violet
eyes
looking
up
at
his
every
now
and
then
shyly
entrancingly
as
he
bent
his
head
to
talk
to
her
the
squadron
ball
was
in
full
swing
between
midnight
and
the
first
hour
of
morning
the
flowers
had
not
lost
their
freshness
the
odours
of
dust
and
feverish
human
breath
had
not
yet
polluted
the
atmosphere
the
windows
were
open
to
the
purple
night
the
purple
sea
the
stars
seemed
to
be
close
outside
the
verandah
shining
on
purpose
for
the
dancers
and
these
two
the
man
tall
pale
dark
with
flashing
eyes
and
short
sleek
raven
hair
small
head
noble
bearing
the
girl
divinely
lovely
in
her
marble
purity
of
complexion
her
classical
grace
of
form
these
two
were
as
every
one
avowed
and
acknowledged
the
handsomest
couple
in
the
room
none
of
us
in
it
compared
with
them
said
a
young
naval
commander
to
his
partner
whereupon
the
young
lady
looked
somewhat
sourly
and
replied
that
lady
lesbia
features
were
undeniably
regular
and
her
complexion
good
but
that
she
was
wanting
in
soul
she
asked
the
sailor
incredulously
at
her
now
what
do
you
call
that
if
it
is
soul
call
it
simply
disgraceful
answered
his
partner
sharply
turning
away
her
head
lesbia
was
looking
up
at
the
spaniard
her
lips
faintly
parted
all
her
face
listening
eagerly
as
she
caught
some
whispered
word
breathed
among
the
soft
ripples
of
her
hair
from
lips
that
almost
touched
her
brow
people
can
not
go
on
waltzing
for
ten
minutes
in
a
dead
silence
like
automatic
dancers
there
must
be
conversation
only
it
is
better
that
the
lips
should
do
most
of
the
talking
when
the
eyes
have
so
much
to
say
society
is
apt
to
be
censorious
smithson
was
smoking
a
cigarette
on
the
lawn
with
a
sporting
peer
a
man
to
whom
tobacco
is
a
necessity
can
not
be
always
on
guard
but
it
is
quite
possible
that
in
the
present
state
of
lady
lesbia
feelings
smithson
would
have
had
no
restraining
influence
had
he
been
ever
so
watchful
to
what
act
in
the
passion
drama
had
her
love
come
as
she
floated
round
the
room
with
her
head
inclined
towards
her
breast
the
strong
pulsation
of
his
heart
sounding
in
her
ear
like
the
rhythmical
beat
of
the
basses
yonder
in
waldteufel
last
waltz
was
there
still
the
uncertainty
as
to
the
which
marks
the
third
act
of
a
good
play
or
was
there
the
dread
foreboding
the
sense
of
impending
doom
which
should
stir
the
spectators
with
pity
and
terror
as
the
fourth
act
hurries
to
its
passionate
close
who
could
tell
she
had
been
full
of
life
and
energy
on
board
the
yacht
during
the
racing
in
which
she
seemed
to
take
an
ardent
interest
the
had
followed
the
racers
for
three
hours
through
a
freshening
sea
much
to
lady
kirkbank
disgust
and
lesbia
had
been
the
soul
of
the
party
the
same
yesterday
the
yacht
had
only
got
back
to
cowes
in
time
for
the
ball
and
all
had
been
hurry
and
excitement
while
the
ladies
dressed
and
crossed
to
the
club
the
spray
dashing
over
their
opera
mantles
poor
lady
kirkbank
complexion
yellow
with
de
in
spite
of
a
double
coating
of
de
the
last
fashionable
cosmetic
lesbia
was
curiously
silent
depressed
even
as
it
seemed
to
those
who
were
interested
in
observing
her
and
all
the
world
is
interested
in
a
famous
beauty
she
was
very
pale
even
her
lips
were
colourless
and
the
large
violet
eyes
and
firmly
pencilled
brows
alone
gave
colour
to
her
face
she
looked
like
a
marble
statue
the
eyes
and
eyebrows
accentuated
with
touches
of
colour
those
lovely
eyes
had
a
heavy
look
as
of
trouble
weariness
nay
absolute
distress
never
had
she
looked
less
brilliant
than
never
had
she
looked
more
beautiful
it
was
the
loveliness
of
a
soul
the
wonderful
of
life
with
its
infinite
evil
its
little
good
had
given
up
its
secret
she
knew
what
passionate
love
really
means
she
knew
what
such
love
mostly
means
surrender
of
the
world
wealth
severance
from
friends
the
breaking
of
all
old
ties
to
love
as
she
loved
means
the
crossing
of
a
river
more
fatal
than
the
rubicon
the
casting
of
a
die
more
desperate
than
that
which
cæsar
flung
upon
the
board
when
he
took
up
arms
against
the
republic
the
river
was
not
yet
crossed
but
her
feet
were
on
the
margin
wet
with
the
ripple
of
the
stream
the
fatal
die
was
not
yet
cast
but
the
was
in
her
hand
ready
for
the
throw
lesbia
and
montesma
danced
together
not
too
often
three
waltzes
out
of
sixteen
but
when
they
were
so
waltzing
they
were
the
cynosure
of
the
room
that
betting
of
which
maulevrier
had
heard
was
rife
and
the
odds
upon
the
cuban
had
gone
up
it
was
nine
to
four
now
that
those
two
would
be
over
the
border
before
the
week
was
out
smithson
was
not
neglectful
of
his
affianced
he
took
her
into
the
where
she
drank
some
moselle
cup
but
ate
nothing
he
sat
out
three
or
four
waltzes
with
her
on
the
lawn
listening
to
the
murmer
of
the
sea
and
talking
very
little
are
looking
wretchedly
ill
lesbia
he
said
after
a
dismal
silence
am
sorry
that
i
should
put
you
to
shame
by
my
bad
looks
she
answered
with
that
keen
acidity
of
tone
which
indicates
irritated
nerves
know
that
i
do
mean
anything
of
the
kind
you
are
always
lovely
always
the
loveliest
everywhere
but
i
do
like
to
see
you
so
ghastly
pale
suppose
i
am
that
i
have
done
too
much
in
london
and
here
life
in
westmoreland
was
very
different
she
added
with
a
sigh
and
a
touch
of
wonder
that
the
lesbia
haselden
whose
methodical
life
had
never
been
stirred
by
a
ruffle
of
passion
could
have
been
the
same
flesh
and
blood
yes
verily
the
same
woman
whose
heart
throbbed
so
vehemently
whose
brain
seemed
on
fire
you
sure
there
is
nothing
the
matter
he
asked
with
a
faint
quiver
in
his
voice
should
there
be
the
matter
can
say
god
knows
that
i
know
no
cause
for
evil
i
am
honest
enough
and
faithful
enough
lesbia
but
your
face
is
like
a
presage
of
calamity
like
the
dull
livid
sky
that
goes
before
a
thunderstorm
hope
there
is
no
thunderbolt
coming
she
answered
lightly
very
tall
talk
about
a
headache
for
really
that
is
all
that
ails
me
hark
they
have
begun
my
queen
i
am
engaged
for
this
waltz
am
sorry
for
that
am
i
would
ever
so
much
rather
have
stayed
out
here
two
hours
later
in
the
steely
morning
light
when
sea
and
land
and
sky
had
a
metallic
look
as
if
lit
by
electricity
lady
lesbia
stood
with
her
chaperon
and
her
affianced
husband
on
the
landing
stage
belonging
to
the
club
ready
to
step
into
the
boat
in
which
six
swarthy
seamen
in
red
shirts
and
caps
were
to
row
them
back
to
the
yacht
smithson
drew
the
warm
de
with
its
satin
lining
and
white
fox
border
closer
round
lesbia
slender
form
are
shivering
he
said
ought
to
have
warmer
wraps
is
warm
enough
for
petersburg
i
am
only
tired
very
tired
will
rock
you
to
sleep
don
gomez
was
standing
close
by
waiting
for
his
host
the
two
men
were
to
walk
up
the
hill
to
formosa
a
village
with
a
classic
portico
delightfully
situated
above
the
town
time
are
we
to
come
to
breakfast
asked
smithson
too
early
in
mercy
name
two
in
the
afternoon
three
four
why
not
make
it
five
combine
breakfast
with
afternoon
tea
exclaimed
lady
kirkbank
with
a
tremendous
yawn
never
was
so
thoroughly
fagged
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
beaten
with
sticks
basti
what
its
name
she
was
leaning
all
her
weight
upon
smithson
as
he
handed
her
down
the
steps
and
into
the
boat
her
normal
weight
was
not
a
trifle
and
this
morning
she
was
heavy
with
champagne
and
sleep
carefully
as
smithson
supported
her
she
gave
a
lurch
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
and
plunged
ponderously
into
the
boat
which
dipped
and
careened
under
her
whereat
she
shrieked
and
implored
smithson
to
save
her
all
this
occupied
some
minutes
and
gave
lesbia
and
the
cuban
just
time
for
a
few
words
that
had
to
be
said
somehow
said
montesma
as
they
clasped
hands
and
then
in
a
lower
voice
he
said
have
you
decided
at
last
shall
it
be
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
or
so
pale
in
the
starlight
and
then
murmured
an
almost
inaudible
syllable
he
bent
quickly
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
her
gloved
hand
and
when
smithson
looked
round
they
two
were
standing
apart
montesma
in
a
listless
attitude
as
if
tired
of
waiting
for
his
host
it
was
smithson
who
handed
lesbia
into
the
boat
and
arranged
her
wraps
and
hung
over
her
tenderly
as
he
performed
those
small
offices
really
he
asked
just
before
the
boat
put
off
are
we
to
be
with
you
kirkbank
says
not
till
afternoon
tea
but
i
think
you
may
come
a
few
hours
earlier
i
am
not
at
all
sleepy
look
as
if
you
needed
sleep
badly
answered
smithson
afraid
you
are
not
half
careful
enough
of
yourself
the
boat
was
gliding
off
the
oars
dipping
as
he
spoke
how
swiftly
it
shot
from
his
ken
flashing
in
and
out
among
the
yachts
where
the
lamps
were
burning
dimly
in
that
clear
radiance
of
day
montesma
gave
a
tremendous
yawn
as
he
took
out
his
and
he
and
smithson
did
not
say
twenty
words
between
them
during
the
walk
to
formosa
where
servants
were
sitting
up
lamps
burning
a
great
silver
tray
with
brandy
soda
liqueurs
coffee
in
readiness
chapter
xliii
for
sorrow
is
all
the
end
of
lady
kirkbank
retired
to
her
cabin
directly
she
got
on
board
the
child
i
am
more
than
half
asleep
she
said
i
think
if
there
were
to
be
an
earthquake
an
hour
hence
i
should
hardly
hear
it
go
to
your
berth
directly
lesbia
you
look
positively
awful
i
have
seen
girls
look
bad
after
balls
before
now
but
i
never
saw
such
a
spectre
as
you
look
this
morning
poor
georgie
own
complexion
left
something
to
be
desired
the
de
had
been
a
brilliant
success
for
the
first
two
hours
after
that
the
warm
room
began
to
tell
upon
it
and
there
came
a
greasiness
then
a
streakiness
and
now
all
that
was
left
of
an
alabaster
skin
was
a
livid
patch
of
purplish
paint
here
and
there
upon
a
ground
the
eyebrows
too
had
given
in
and
narrow
lines
of
vandyke
brown
meandered
down
lady
kirkbank
cheeks
the
frizzy
hair
had
gone
altogether
wrong
and
had
a
wild
look
suggestive
of
the
witches
in
macbeth
and
the
scraggy
neck
and
poor
old
shoulders
showed
every
year
of
their
age
in
the
ghastly
morning
light
lesbia
waited
in
the
saloon
till
lady
kirkbank
had
bolted
herself
into
her
cabin
and
then
she
went
up
to
the
deck
wrapped
in
her
cloak
and
coiled
herself
in
a
bamboo
and
nestled
her
bare
head
into
a
turkish
pillow
and
tried
to
sleep
there
with
the
cool
morning
breeze
blowing
upon
her
burning
forehead
and
the
of
seawater
soothing
her
ear
there
were
only
three
or
four
sailors
on
deck
weird
almost
creatures
lesbia
thought
in
striped
shirts
with
bare
arms
of
a
shining
bronze
complexion
flashing
black
eyes
sleek
raven
hair
a
sinister
look
what
species
of
men
they
were
mestizoes
coolies
yucatekes
she
knew
not
but
she
felt
that
they
were
something
wild
and
strange
and
their
presence
filled
her
with
a
vague
fear
whose
influence
now
ruled
her
life
had
told
her
that
these
men
were
born
mariners
and
that
she
was
twenty
times
safer
with
them
than
when
the
yacht
had
been
under
the
control
of
those
honest
grinning
english
jack
tars
but
she
liked
the
english
sailors
best
all
the
same
and
she
shrank
from
the
faintest
contact
with
these
strangers
plucking
away
the
train
of
her
gown
as
they
passed
her
chair
lest
they
should
brush
against
her
drapery
on
deck
this
morning
with
only
those
dark
faces
near
she
had
a
sense
of
loneliness
of
helplessness
of
abandonment
even
unbidden
the
image
of
her
home
at
grasmere
flashed
into
her
mind
all
things
so
calm
so
perfectly
ordered
such
a
sense
of
safety
of
home
no
peril
no
temptation
no
fever
only
peace
and
she
had
grown
sick
to
death
of
peace
she
had
prayed
for
tempest
and
the
tempest
had
come
there
was
a
heavenly
quiet
in
the
air
in
the
early
summer
morning
only
the
creaking
of
a
spar
the
scream
of
a
seagull
now
and
then
how
pale
the
lamps
were
growing
on
board
the
yachts
paler
still
yellow
and
dim
and
blurred
yonder
in
the
town
the
eastward
facing
windows
were
golden
with
the
rising
sun
yes
this
was
morning
the
yachts
were
moving
away
yonder
majestical
white
sails
shining
against
the
blue
she
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
sleep
but
sleep
would
not
come
she
was
always
listening
listening
for
the
dip
of
oars
listening
for
a
snatch
of
melody
from
a
mellow
baritone
whose
every
accent
she
knew
so
well
it
came
at
last
the
sound
her
soul
longed
for
she
lay
among
her
cushions
with
closed
eyes
listening
drinking
in
those
rich
ripe
notes
as
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
measure
of
dipping
oars
donna
e
mobile
nearer
and
nearer
until
the
little
boat
ground
against
the
hull
she
lifted
her
heavy
eyelids
as
montesma
leapt
over
the
gunwale
almost
into
her
arms
he
was
at
her
side
kneeling
by
her
low
chair
kissing
the
little
hands
chill
with
the
freshness
of
morning
own
my
very
own
he
murmured
passionately
he
cared
no
more
for
those
helots
yonder
than
if
they
had
been
made
of
wood
he
had
fate
in
his
own
hands
now
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
went
to
the
skipper
and
gave
him
some
orders
in
spanish
and
then
the
sails
were
unfurled
the
spread
her
broad
white
wings
and
moved
off
among
those
other
yachts
which
were
gliding
gliding
gliding
out
to
sea
melting
from
cowes
roads
like
a
vision
that
fadeth
with
the
broad
light
of
morning
when
the
sails
were
up
and
the
yacht
was
running
merrily
through
the
water
montesma
went
back
to
lady
lesbia
and
they
two
sat
side
by
side
gilded
and
glorified
in
the
vivid
lights
of
sunrise
talking
as
they
had
never
talked
before
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
a
smile
of
ineffable
peace
upon
her
lips
as
of
a
weary
child
that
has
found
rest
they
were
sailing
for
havre
and
at
havre
they
were
to
be
married
by
the
english
chaplain
and
from
havre
they
were
to
sail
for
the
havana
and
to
live
there
ever
afterwards
in
a
dream
of
bliss
broken
only
by
an
annual
visit
to
paris
just
to
buy
gowns
and
bonnets
surrendered
were
all
lesbia
ambitious
hopes
forgotten
gone
her
desire
to
reign
princess
paramount
in
the
kingdom
of
fashion
her
thirst
to
be
wealthiest
among
the
wealthy
gone
forgotten
her
dreams
now
were
of
the
far
of
a
tropical
climate
a
boudoir
giving
on
the
caribbean
sea
cigarettes
coffee
nights
spent
in
a
foreign
opera
house
the
languid
reposeful
existence
of
a
spanish
dama
with
him
with
him
it
was
for
his
sake
that
she
had
modified
all
her
ideas
of
life
to
be
with
him
she
would
have
been
content
to
dwell
in
the
tents
of
the
patagonians
on
the
wild
and
pampas
a
love
which
was
strong
enough
to
make
her
sacrifice
duty
the
world
her
fair
fame
as
a
woman
was
a
love
that
recked
but
little
of
the
paths
along
which
her
lover
hand
was
to
lead
for
him
to
be
with
him
she
renounced
the
world
the
rest
did
not
count
the
summer
hours
glided
past
them
the
was
far
out
at
sea
all
the
other
yachts
had
vanished
and
they
were
alone
amidst
the
blue
with
only
a
solitary
yonder
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
more
than
once
lesbia
had
talked
of
going
below
to
change
her
ball
gown
for
the
attire
of
everyday
life
but
each
time
her
lover
had
detained
her
a
little
longer
had
pleaded
for
a
few
more
words
lady
kirkbank
would
be
astir
presently
and
there
would
be
no
more
solitude
for
them
till
they
were
married
and
could
shake
her
off
altogether
so
lesbia
stayed
and
those
two
drank
the
cup
of
bliss
hushed
by
the
monotonous
of
the
sea
the
rhythm
of
the
swinging
sails
but
now
it
was
broad
morning
the
hour
when
society
however
late
it
may
keep
its
revels
overnight
is
apt
to
awaken
were
it
only
to
call
for
a
cup
of
strong
tea
and
to
turn
again
on
the
pillow
of
lassitude
after
that
refreshment
like
the
sluggard
of
holy
writ
at
ten
the
sun
sent
his
golden
arrows
across
the
silken
coverlet
of
her
berth
and
awakened
lady
kirkbank
who
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
about
languidly
the
little
cabin
was
heaving
itself
up
and
down
in
a
curious
way
smithson
were
sloping
as
if
they
were
going
to
fall
upon
lady
kirkbank
couch
and
the
with
all
its
dainty
appliances
was
making
an
angle
of
degrees
there
was
more
swirling
and
washing
of
water
against
the
hull
than
ever
georgie
kirkbank
had
heard
in
cowes
roads
on
me
this
horrid
thing
must
be
moving
she
exclaimed
to
the
empty
air
must
have
broken
loose
in
the
night
she
had
no
confidence
in
those
sailors
and
she
had
a
vision
of
the
yacht
drifting
at
the
mercy
of
winds
and
waves
drifting
for
days
weeks
and
months
drifting
to
the
german
ocean
drifting
to
the
north
pole
smithson
and
montesma
on
shore
no
one
on
board
to
exercise
authority
over
those
fearful
men
perhaps
they
had
mutinied
and
were
carrying
off
the
yacht
as
their
booty
with
lesbia
and
her
chaperon
and
all
their
gowns
am
almost
glad
that
harpy
seraphine
has
my
diamonds
thought
poor
georgie
i
should
have
had
them
with
me
on
board
this
hateful
boat
and
then
she
rapped
vehemently
against
the
panel
of
the
cabin
and
screamed
for
rilboche
whose
den
was
adjacent
rilboche
who
detested
the
sea
made
her
appearance
after
some
delay
looking
even
greener
than
her
mistress
who
in
rising
from
her
berth
already
began
to
suffer
the
agonies
of
does
this
mean
exclaimed
lady
kirkbank
where
are
we
going
what
i
should
like
to
know
my
lady
but
i
daresay
lady
lesbia
and
montesma
can
tell
you
they
are
both
on
deck
why
we
left
him
on
shore
my
lady
but
he
came
on
board
at
five
this
morning
i
looked
at
my
watch
when
i
heard
him
land
and
he
and
lady
lesbia
have
been
sitting
on
deck
ever
since
now
it
is
ten
five
hours
on
deck
impossible
does
seem
long
when
one
is
happy
my
lady
murmured
rilboche
in
her
own
language
me
to
dress
this
instant
screamed
her
mistress
dreadful
spaniard
is
eloping
with
us
despite
the
hideous
depression
of
that
malady
which
strikes
down
kaiser
and
beggar
with
the
same
rough
hand
lady
kirkbank
contrived
to
get
herself
dressed
decently
and
to
stagger
up
the
companion
to
that
part
of
the
deck
where
the
persian
carpet
was
spread
and
the
bamboo
chairs
and
tables
were
set
out
under
the
striped
awning
lesbia
and
her
lover
were
sitting
together
he
giving
her
a
first
lesson
in
the
art
of
smoking
a
cigarette
he
had
told
her
playfully
that
every
man
woman
and
child
in
cuba
was
a
smoker
and
she
had
besought
him
to
let
her
begin
and
now
with
infinite
coquetry
was
taking
her
first
lesson
shameless
minx
exclaimed
georgie
pale
with
anger
is
smithson
my
poor
good
smithson
asleep
in
his
bed
at
formosa
i
hope
dear
lady
kirkbank
the
cuban
answered
with
perfect
is
out
of
it
as
you
idiomatic
english
say
i
hope
lady
kirkbank
you
will
be
as
kind
to
me
as
you
have
been
to
smithson
and
depend
upon
it
i
shall
make
lady
lesbia
as
good
a
husband
as
ever
smithson
could
have
done
exclaimed
the
matron
contemptuously
a
foreigner
an
adventurer
who
may
be
as
poor
as
job
for
anything
i
know
about
you
was
once
rather
comfortably
off
lady
kirkbank
and
i
can
answer
for
it
that
montesma
wife
will
know
none
of
the
pangs
of
poverty
you
were
a
beggar
i
would
not
care
said
lesbia
drawing
nearer
to
him
they
had
both
risen
at
lady
kirkbank
approach
and
were
standing
side
by
side
confronting
her
lesbia
had
shrunk
from
the
idea
of
poverty
with
john
hammond
yet
for
this
man
sake
she
was
ready
to
face
penury
ruin
disgrace
anything
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
lord
maulevrier
sister
a
young
lady
under
my
charge
answerable
to
me
for
her
conduct
is
capable
of
jilting
the
man
to
whom
she
has
solemnly
bound
herself
in
order
to
marry
you
demanded
lady
kirkbank
turning
to
montesma
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
answered
lesbia
boldly
would
be
a
greater
sin
to
keep
my
promise
than
to
break
it
i
never
liked
that
man
and
you
know
it
you
badgered
me
into
accepting
him
against
my
own
better
judgment
you
drifted
me
so
deeply
into
debt
that
i
was
willing
to
marry
a
man
i
loathed
in
order
to
get
my
debts
paid
is
what
you
did
for
the
girl
placed
under
your
charge
but
thank
god
i
have
released
myself
from
your
clutches
i
am
going
far
away
to
a
new
world
where
the
memory
of
my
old
life
can
not
follow
me
people
may
be
angry
or
pleased
i
do
not
care
i
shall
be
the
wife
of
the
man
i
have
chosen
out
of
all
the
world
for
my
husband
the
man
god
made
to
be
my
master
are
gasped
lady
kirkbank
ca
say
what
you
are
i
never
in
my
life
felt
so
tempted
to
use
improper
language
lady
kirkbank
be
reasonable
pleaded
montesma
can
have
no
interest
in
seeing
lesbia
married
to
a
man
she
dislikes
georgia
reddened
a
little
remembering
that
she
was
interested
to
the
amount
of
some
thousands
in
the
smithson
and
haselden
alliance
but
she
took
a
higher
ground
than
mercenary
considerations
am
interested
in
doing
the
very
best
for
a
young
lady
who
has
been
entrusted
to
my
care
the
granddaughter
of
an
old
friend
she
answered
with
dignity
have
no
objection
to
you
in
the
abstract
don
gomez
you
have
always
been
vastly
civil
i
am
sure
by
us
in
our
day
of
need
lady
kirkbank
and
you
will
find
me
the
staunchest
friend
you
ever
had
am
bound
in
honour
to
consider
smithson
lesbia
said
lady
kirkbank
wonder
that
a
up
girl
can
behave
so
abominably
would
be
more
abominable
to
marry
a
man
i
detest
i
have
made
up
my
mind
lady
kirkbank
we
shall
be
at
havre
morning
and
we
shall
be
married
shall
we
not
gomez
she
let
her
head
sink
upon
his
breast
and
his
arm
enfold
her
thus
sheltered
she
felt
safe
thus
and
thus
only
she
had
thrown
her
cap
over
the
mills
snapped
her
fingers
at
society
cared
not
a
jot
what
the
world
might
think
or
say
of
her
this
man
would
she
marry
and
no
other
this
man
fortune
would
she
follow
for
good
or
evil
he
had
that
kind
of
influence
with
women
which
is
almost
it
smells
of
brimstone
my
dear
good
soul
said
montesma
smiling
at
the
angry
matron
not
take
things
quietly
you
have
had
a
good
many
girls
under
your
wing
and
you
must
know
that
youth
and
maturity
see
life
from
a
different
standpoint
in
your
eyes
my
old
friend
smithson
is
an
admirable
match
you
measure
him
by
his
houses
his
stable
his
book
but
lesbia
would
rather
marry
the
man
she
loves
and
take
the
risks
of
his
fate
i
am
not
a
pauper
lady
kirkbank
and
the
home
to
which
i
shall
take
my
love
is
pretty
enough
for
a
princess
of
the
blood
royal
and
for
her
sake
i
shall
grow
richer
yet
he
added
with
his
eyes
kindling
if
you
care
to
pay
us
a
visit
next
february
in
our
parisian
apartment
i
will
promise
you
as
pleasant
a
nest
as
you
can
wish
to
occupy
do
i
know
that
you
will
ever
bring
her
back
to
europe
said
lady
kirkbank
piteously
do
i
know
that
you
will
not
bury
her
alive
in
your
savage
country
among
blackamoors
like
those
horrid
sailors
over
there
kill
her
perhaps
when
you
are
tired
of
her
at
these
words
of
lady
kirkbank
flung
out
at
random
montesma
blanched
and
his
deep
black
eye
met
hers
with
a
strangely
sinister
look
she
cried
hysterically
her
kill
her
you
look
as
if
you
could
do
it
lesbia
nestled
closer
to
her
lover
heart
dare
you
say
such
things
to
him
she
cried
angrily
trust
him
do
you
see
trust
him
with
my
whole
heart
with
all
my
soul
i
shall
be
his
wife
for
good
or
evil
much
for
evil
i
afraid
said
lady
kirkbank
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
come
to
your
cabin
and
take
off
that
ball
gown
and
make
yourself
just
a
little
less
disreputable
in
outward
appearance
while
i
get
a
cup
of
tea
lesbia
obeyed
and
went
down
to
her
cabin
where
kibble
was
waiting
with
a
fresh
white
muslin
frock
and
all
its
belongings
laid
out
ready
for
her
mistress
sorely
perplexed
at
the
turn
which
affairs
were
taking
she
had
never
liked
horace
smithson
although
he
had
given
her
tips
which
were
almost
a
provision
for
her
old
age
but
she
had
thought
it
a
good
thing
that
her
mistress
who
was
frightfully
extravagant
should
marry
a
millionaire
and
now
they
were
sailing
over
the
sea
with
a
lot
of
coloured
sailors
and
the
millionaire
was
left
on
shore
lady
kirkbank
went
into
the
saloon
where
breakfast
was
laid
ready
and
where
the
steward
was
in
attendance
with
that
air
of
being
absolutely
unconscious
of
any
domestic
disturbance
which
is
the
mark
of
a
servant
lesbia
appeared
in
something
less
than
an
hour
newly
dressed
and
fresh
looking
in
her
pure
white
gown
her
brown
hair
bound
in
a
coronet
round
her
small
greek
head
she
sat
down
by
lady
kirkbank
side
and
tried
to
coax
her
into
good
humour
ca
you
take
things
pleasantly
dear
she
pleaded
now
like
a
good
soul
you
heard
him
say
he
was
well
off
and
that
he
will
take
me
to
paris
next
winter
and
you
can
come
to
us
there
on
your
way
from
cannes
and
stay
with
us
till
easter
it
will
be
so
nice
when
the
prince
and
all
the
best
people
are
in
paris
we
shall
only
stay
in
cuba
till
the
fuss
about
my
running
away
is
all
over
and
people
have
forgotten
do
you
know
as
for
smithson
why
should
i
have
any
more
compunction
about
jilting
him
than
he
had
about
that
poor
miss
trinder
i
want
you
to
send
him
back
all
his
presents
for
me
they
are
almost
all
in
arlington
street
i
brought
nothing
with
me
except
my
engagement
ring
looking
down
at
the
of
diamonds
and
pulling
it
off
her
fingers
as
she
talked
had
a
kind
of
presentiment
mean
that
you
had
made
up
your
mind
to
throw
him
over
but
i
felt
there
were
breakers
ahead
it
might
have
come
to
throwing
myself
into
the
sea
perhaps
you
would
have
liked
that
better
than
what
has
happened
do
know
i
sure
the
whole
thing
is
disgraceful
london
will
ring
with
the
scandal
what
am
i
to
say
to
lady
maulevrier
to
your
brother
and
pray
how
do
you
propose
to
get
married
at
havre
you
can
not
be
married
in
a
french
town
by
merely
holding
up
your
finger
there
are
no
registry
offices
i
am
sure
i
have
no
idea
how
the
thing
is
done
gomez
has
arranged
all
that
everything
has
been
thought
of
everything
has
been
planned
a
steamer
will
take
us
to
thomas
and
another
steamer
will
take
us
on
to
cuba
the
marriage
the
licence
tell
you
everything
has
been
provided
for
please
take
this
ring
and
send
it
to
smithson
when
you
go
back
to
england
it
to
him
yourself
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
dreadfully
disagreeable
you
are
said
lesbia
pouting
because
i
am
marrying
to
please
myself
instead
of
to
please
you
it
is
frightfully
selfish
of
you
montesma
came
in
at
this
moment
he
too
had
dressed
himself
freshly
and
was
looking
his
handsomest
in
that
buccaneer
style
of
costume
which
he
wore
when
he
sailed
the
yacht
he
and
lesbia
breakfasted
at
their
ease
while
lady
kirkbank
reclined
in
her
bamboo
feeling
very
unhappy
in
her
mind
and
far
from
well
neptune
and
she
could
not
accommodate
themselves
after
a
leisurely
breakfast
enlivened
by
talk
and
laughter
the
cabin
windows
open
the
sun
shining
the
freshening
breeze
blowing
in
lesbia
and
don
gomez
went
on
deck
and
he
reclined
at
her
feet
while
she
read
to
him
from
the
pages
of
her
favourite
keats
read
languidly
lazily
yet
exquisitely
for
she
had
been
taught
to
read
as
well
as
to
sing
the
poetry
seemed
to
have
been
written
on
purpose
for
them
and
the
sky
and
the
atmosphere
around
them
seemed
to
have
been
made
for
the
poetry
and
so
with
intervals
of
strolling
on
the
deck
and
an
hour
or
so
dawdled
away
at
luncheon
and
a
leisurely
afternoon
tea
the
day
wore
on
to
sunset
and
they
went
back
to
keats
while
lady
kirkbank
sulked
and
slept
in
a
corner
of
the
saloon
is
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
lesbia
murmured
in
a
pause
of
their
reading
when
they
had
dropped
endymion
love
to
talk
of
their
own
not
of
mine
my
angel
i
shall
be
happier
still
when
we
are
far
away
on
broader
waters
beyond
the
reach
of
all
who
can
part
us
any
one
part
us
gomez
now
that
we
have
pledged
ourselves
to
each
other
she
asked
incredulously
love
such
pledges
are
sometimes
broken
all
women
are
not
while
the
sea
is
smooth
and
the
ship
runs
fair
all
is
easy
enough
but
when
tempest
and
peril
come
that
is
the
test
lesbia
will
you
stand
by
me
in
the
tempest
love
know
that
i
will
she
answered
with
her
hand
locked
in
his
two
hands
clasped
as
with
a
clasp
she
could
not
imagine
any
severe
ordeal
to
be
gone
through
if
maulevrier
heard
of
her
elopement
in
time
for
pursuit
there
would
be
a
fuss
perhaps
an
angry
bother
raging
and
fuming
but
what
of
that
she
was
her
own
mistress
maulevrier
could
not
prevent
her
marrying
whomsoever
she
pleased
that
you
will
hold
to
me
against
all
the
world
he
said
passionately
turning
his
head
to
look
across
the
stern
of
the
vessel
all
the
world
she
answered
softly
believe
your
courage
will
be
tested
before
long
he
said
and
then
he
cried
to
the
skipper
on
all
sail
tomaso
that
boat
is
chasing
us
lesbia
sprang
to
her
feet
looking
as
he
looked
to
a
spot
of
vivid
white
on
the
horizon
montesma
had
snatched
up
a
glass
and
was
watching
that
distant
spot
is
a
he
said
will
catch
us
he
was
right
although
the
strained
every
timber
so
that
her
keel
cut
through
the
water
like
a
boomerang

and

beat

without

in

than
an
hour
the
was
beside
the
and
lord
maulevrier
and
lord
hartfield
had
boarded
smithson
deck
have
come
to
take
you
and
lady
kirkbank
back
to
cowes
lesbia
said
maulevrier
not
going
to
make
any
undue
fuss
about
this
little
escapade
of
yours
provided
you
go
back
with
hartfield
and
me
at
once
and
pledge
yourself
never
to
hold
any
further
communication
with
don
gomez
de
montesma
the
spaniard
was
standing
close
by
silent
white
as
death
but
ready
to
make
a
good
fight
that
pallor
of
the
clear
olive
skin
was
not
from
want
of
pluck
but
there
was
the
deadly
knowledge
of
the
ground
he
stood
upon
the
doubt
that
any
woman
least
of
all
such
a
woman
as
lady
lesbia
haselden
could
be
true
to
him
if
his
character
and
antecedents
were
revealed
to
her
and
how
much
or
how
little
these
two
men
could
tell
her
about
himself
or
his
past
life
was
the
question
which
the
next
few
minutes
would
solve
am
not
going
back
with
you
answered
lesbia
am
going
to
havre
with
don
gomez
de
montesma
we
are
to
be
married
there
as
soon
as
we
arrive
be
married
at
havre
cried
maulevrier
appropriate

a

has
a
wife
in
every

do
you
know
had
better
go
down
to
the
cabin
said
hartfield
laying
his
hand
upon
his
friend
shoulder
lady
lesbia
will
be
good
enough
to
come
with
us
we
can
tell
her
all
that
we
have
to
tell
quietly
there
lord
hartfield
tone
was
unmistakeable
everything
was
known
can
talk
at
your
ease
here
said
montesma
facing
the
two
men
with
a
diabolical
recklessness
and
insolence
of
manner
one
of
these
fellows
on
board
knows
a
dozen
sentences
of
english
would
rather
talk
below
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
señor
and
i
should
be
glad
to
speak
to
lady
lesbia
alone
you
shall
not
do
unless
she
desires
it
answered
montesma
he
shall
hear
all
that
you
have
to
say
he
shall
hear
how
i
answer
you
said
lesbia
lord
hartfield
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
please
he
said
will
make
the
disclosure
a
little
more
painful
than
it
need
have
been
but
that
can
not
be
helped
chapter
xliv
sad
kissed
mouth
how
sorrowful
it
is
they
all
went
down
to
the
saloon
where
lady
kirkbank
sat
looking
the
image
of
despair
which
changed
to
delighted
surprise
at
sight
of
lord
hartfield
and
his
friend
you
give
your
consent
to
my
sister
elopement
with
this
man
lady
kirkbank
maulevrier
asked
brusquely
give
my
consent
good
gracious
no
he
has
eloped
with
me
ever
so
much
more
than
with
your
sister
she
knew
all
about
it
i
no
doubt
but
the
wretch
ran
away
with
me
in
my
sleep
am
glad
for
your
own
that
you
had
no
hand
in
this
disgraceful
business
replied
maulevrier
and
then
turning
to
lord
hartfield
he
said
will
you
tell
my
sister
who
and
what
this
man
is
will
you
make
her
understand
what
kind
of
pitfall
she
has
escaped
upon
my
soul
i
can
not
speak
of
it
recognise
no
right
of
lord
hartfield
to
interfere
with
my
actions
and
i
will
hear
nothing
that
he
may
have
to
say
said
lesbia
standing
by
her
lover
side
with
head
erect
and
eyes
dark
with
anger
sister
husband
has
the
strongest
right
to
control
your
actions
lady
lesbia
when
the
family
honour
is
at
stake
answered
hartfield
with
grave
authority
me
at
least
as
a
member
of
your
family
if
you
will
not
accept
me
as
your
disinterested
and
devoted
friend
echoed
lesbia
scornfully
might
have
been
my
friend
once
your
friendship
then
would
have
been
of
some
value
to
me
if
you
had
told
me
the
truth
instead
of
approaching
me
with
a
lie
upon
your
lips
you
talk
of
honour
lord
hartfield
you
who
came
to
my
grandmother
house
as
an
impostor
under
a
false
name
went
there
as
a
man
standing
on
his
own
merits
assuming
no
rank
save
that
which
god
gave
him
among
his
claiming
to
be
possessed
of
no
fortune
except
intellect
and
industry
if
i
could
not
win
a
wife
with
such
credentials
it
were
better
for
me
never
to
marry
at
all
lady
lesbia
but
we
have
no
time
to
speak
of
the
past
i
am
here
as
your
brother
friend
here
to
save
you
part
me
from
the
man
to
whom
i
have
given
my
heart
that
you
can
not
do
gomez
why
do
you
not
speak
tell
him
tell
him
cried
lesbia
with
a
voice
strangled
by
sobs
him
that
i
am
to
be
your
wife
at
havre
your
wife
lady
lesbia
that
can
not
be
said
lord
hartfield
sorrowfully
pitying
her
in
her
helplessness
as
he
might
have
pitied
a
young
bird
in
the
fowler
net
am
assured
upon
undeniable
authority
that
señor
montesma
has
a
wife
living
at
cuba
and
even
were
this
not
so
were
he
free
to
marry
you
his
character
and
antecedents
would
for
ever
forbid
such
a
marriage
wife
no
no
no
shrieked
lesbia
looking
wildly
from
one
to
the
other
is
a
lie
a
lie
invented
by
my
brother
who
always
hated
me
by
you
who
fooled
and
deceived
me
it
is
a
lie
an
infamous
invention
don
gomez
speak
to
them
for
pity
sake
answer
them
you
see
that
they
are
driving
me
mad
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
she
buried
her
dishevelled
head
upon
his
breast
she
clung
to
him
with
hands
that
writhed
convulsively
in
her
agony
maulevrier
sprang
across
the
cabin
and
wrenched
her
from
her
grasp
shall
not
pollute
her
with
your
touch
he
cried
have
poisoned
her
mind
already
scoundrel
seducer
do
you
hear
lesbia
shall
i
tell
you
what
this
man
is
what
trade
he
followed
yonder
on
his
native
island
this
spanish
hidalgo
this
gentleman
lineal
descendant
of
the
cid
fine
flower
of
andalusian
chivalry
it
was
not
enough
for
him
to
cheat
at
cards
to
float
bubble
companies
bogus
lotteries
his
profligate
extravagance
his
love
of
sybarite
luxury
required
a
larger
resource
than
the
petty
schemes
which
enrich
smaller
men
a
slave
ship
which
could
earn
nearly
twenty
thousand
pounds
on
every
voyage
and
which
could
make
two
runs
in
a
year
that
was
the
trade
for
don
gomez
de
montesma
and
he
carried
it
on
merrily
for
six
or
seven
years
till
the
british
cruisers
got
too
keen
for
him
and
the
good
old
game
was
played
out
you
see
that
scar
upon
the
hidalgo
forehead
lesbia
a
token
of
knightly
prowess
you
think
perhaps
no
my
girl
that
is
the
mark
of
an
english
cutlass
in
a
scuffle
on
board
a
slaver
a
merry
trade
lesbia
the
living
cargo
stowed
close
under
hatches
have
rather
a
bad
time
of
it
now
and
then
short
rations
of
food
and
water
yellow
jack
they
die
like
rotten
sheep
sometimes
bad
then
for
the
dealer
but
if
he
can
land
the
bulk
of
his
human
wares
safe
and
sound
the
profits
are
enormous
the
takes
his
capitation
fee
the
blackies
are
drafted
off
to
the
sugar
plantations
and
everybody
is
satisfied
but
i
think
lesbia
that
your
british
prejudices
would
go
against
marriage
with
a
were
he
ever
so
free
to
make
you
his
wife
which
this
particular
dealer
in
blackamoors
is
not
this
true
this
part
of
their
vile
story
demanded
lesbia
looking
at
her
lover
who
stood
apart
from
them
all
now
his
arms
folded
his
face
deadly
pale
the
lower
lip
quivering
under
the
grinding
of
his
strong
white
teeth
is
some
truth
in
it
he
answered
hoarsely
in
cuba
had
a
finger
in
the
african
trade
before
your
british
philanthropy
spoiled
it
smithson
made
sixty
thousand
pounds
in
that
line
it
was
the
foundation
of
his
fortune
and
yet
he
had
his
misfortunes
in
running
his
cargo
a
ship
burnt
a
freight
roasted
alive
there
are
some
very
black
stories
in
cuba
against
poor
smithson
he
will
never
go
there
again
smithson
may
be
a
scoundrel
indeed
i
believe
he
is
a
pretty
bad
specimen
in
that
line
said
lord
hartfield
i
doubt
if
there
is
any
story
that
can
be
told
of
him
quite
so
bad
as
the
history
of
your
marriage
and
the
events
that
went
before
it
i
have
been
told
the
story
of
the
beautiful
octoroon
who
loved
and
trusted
you
who
shared
your
good
and
evil
fortunes
for
the
most
desperate
years
of
your
life
was
almost
accepted
as
your
wife
and
whose
strangled
corpse
was
found
in
the
harbour
while
the
bells
were
ringing
for
your
marriage
with
a
rich
planter
heiress
the
lady
who
no
doubt
now
patiently
awaits
your
return
to
her
native
island
will
wait
a
long
time
said
montesma
fare
ill
if
i
go
back
to
her
lesbia
his
lordship
story
of
the
octoroon
is
a
fable
an
invention
of
my
cuban
enemies
who
hate
us
old
spaniards
with
a
poisonous
hatred
but
this
much
is
true
i
am
a
married
man
bound
fettered
by
a
tie
which
i
abhor
our
havre
marriage
would
have
been
bigamy
on
my
part
a
delusion
on
yours
i
could
not
have
taken
you
to
cuba
i
had
planned
our
life
in
a
fairer
more
civilised
world
i
am
rich
enough
to
have
surrounded
you
with
all
that
makes
life
worth
living
i
would
have
given
you
love
as
true
and
as
deep
as
ever
man
gave
to
woman
all
that
would
have
been
wanting
would
have
been
the
legality
of
the
tie
and
as
law
never
yet
made
a
marriage
happy
which
lacked
the
elements
of
bliss
our
lawless
union
need
not
have
missed
happiness
lesbia
you
said
that
you
would
hold
by
me
come
what
might
the
worst
has
come
love
but
it
leaves
me
not
the
less
your
true
lover
she
looked
at
him
with
wild
despairing
eyes
and
then
with
a
hoarse
strange
cry
rushed
from
the
cabin
and
up
the
companion
with
a
desperate
swiftness
which
seemed
like
the
flight
of
a
bird
montesma
hartfield
maulevrier
all
followed
her
heedless
of
everything
except
the
dire
necessity
of
arresting
her
flight
each
in
his
own
mind
had
divined
her
purpose
they
were
not
too
late
it
was
hartfield
strong
arm
that
caught
her
held
her
as
in
a
vice
dragged
her
away
from
the
edge
of
the
deck
just
where
there
was
a
space
open
to
the
waves
another
instant
and
she
would
have
flung
herself
overboard
she
fell
back
into
lord
hartfield
arms
with
a
wild
choking
cry
me
go
let
me
go
another
moment
and
a
flood
of
crimson
stained
his
as
she
lay
upon
his
breast
with
closed
eyelids
and
lips
in
blessed
unconsciousness
they
carried
her
on
to
the
and
down
to
the
cabin
where
there
was
ample
accommodation
and
some
luxury
although
not
the
elegance
of
bond
street
upholstery
rilboche
lady
kirkbank
kibble
luggage
of
all
kinds
were
transferred
from
one
yacht
to
the
other
even
to
the
vellum
bound
keats
which
lay
face
downwards
on
the
deck
just
where
lesbia
had
flung
it
when
the
was
boarded
the
crew
of
the
helped
in
the
transfer
there
were
plenty
of
hands
and
the
work
was
done
quickly
while
the
meztizoes
yucatekes
caribs
or
whatever
they
were
looked
on
and
grinned
and
while
montesma
stood
leaning
against
the
mast
with
folded
arms
and
sombre
brow
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
when
the
women
and
all
their
belongings
were
on
board
the
lord
hartfield
addressed
himself
to
montesma
you
consider
yourself
entitled
to
call
me
to
account
for
this
evening
work
you
know
where
to
find
me
he
said
montesma
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
threw
away
his
cigarette
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
pas
la
peine
he
said
am
a
dead
shot
and
should
be
pretty
sure
to
send
a
bullet
through
you
if
you
gave
me
the
chance
but
i
should
not
be
any
nearer
winning
her
if
i
killed
you
and
it
is
she
and
she
only
that
i
want
you
may
think
me
an
adventurer
swindler
gambler
what
you
will
but
i
love
her
as
i
never
thought
to
love
a
woman
and
i
should
have
been
true
as
steel
if
she
had
been
plucky
enough
to
trust
me
but
as
i
told
her
an
hour
ago
women
have
not
lion
hearts
they
can
talk
tall
while
the
sky
is
clear
and
the
sun
shines
but
at
the
first
crack
of
thunder
te
you
have
killed
her
began
hartfield
her
no
some
small
bloodvessel
burst
in
the
agitation
of
that
terrible
scene
she
will
be
well
in
a
week
and
she
will
forget
me
but
i
shall
not
forget
her
she
is
the
one
flower
that
has
sprung
on
the
barren
plain
of
my
life
she
was
my
picciola
he
turned
his
back
on
lord
hartfield
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
deck
something
in
his
face
in
the
vibration
of
his
deep
voice
convinced
hartfield
of
his
truth
a
bad
man
undoubtedly
steeped
to
the
lips
in
evil
and
yet
so
far
true
that
he
had
passionately
deeply
devotedly
loved
this
one
woman
it
was
the
dead
of
night
when
lesbia
recovered
consciousness
and
even
then
she
lay
silent
taking
no
heed
of
those
around
her
in
a
state
of
utter
prostration
kibble
nursed
her
carefully
tenderly
all
through
the
night
maulevrier
hardly
left
the
cabin
and
lady
kirkbank
always
more
or
less
a
victim
to
the
agonies
of
still
found
time
to
utter
lamentations
and
wailings
over
the
ruin
of
her
fortune
had
a
girl
such
a
chance
she
moaned
the
best
match
in
society
the
house
in
park
lane
alone
cost
a
fortune
her
diamonds
would
have
been
the
finest
in
london
would
have
been
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
niggers
he
traded
in
out
yonder
answered
maulevrier
you
think
i
would
have
let
my
sister
marry
a
do
believe
a
syllable
of
it
protested
lady
kirkbank
dabbing
her
brow
with
a
handkerchief
steeped
in
eau
de
cologne
vile
fabrication
of
montesma
who
wanted
to
blacken
poor
smithson
character
in
order
to
extenuate
his
own
crimes
we
wo
go
into
that
question
said
maulevrier
wearily
smithson
match
is
off
anyhow
and
it
matters
very
little
to
us
whether
he
made
most
money
out
of
niggers
or
bubble
companies
or
lotteries
or
gaming
hells
am
convinced
that
smithson
made
his
fortune
in
a
thoroughly
gentlemanlike
manner
argued
lady
kirkbank
at
the
people
who
visit
him
and
the
houses
he
goes
to
and
i
do
see
why
the
match
need
be
off
i
sure
if
lesbia
plays
her
cards
properly
he
will
look
over
this
this
little
escapade
maulevrier
contemplated
the
worldly
old
face
with
infinite
scorn
she
look
like
a
girl
who
will
play
her
cards
in
your
fashion
he
asked
pointing
to
his
sister
whose
white
face
upon
the
pillow
seemed
like
a
mask
cut
out
of
marble
my
soul
lady
kirkbank
i
consider
my
sister
elopement
with
this
spanish
adventurer
with
whom
she
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
a
far
more
respectable
act
than
her
engagement
to
smithson
for
whom
she
cared
not
a
straw
i
hope
if
you
so
approve
of
her
conduct
you
will
help
her
to
pay
her
dressmaker
and
the
rest
of
them
retorted
lady
kirkbank
has
been
plunging
rather
deeply
i
believe
under
the
impression
that
smithson
would
pay
all
her
bills
when
she
was
married
your
grandmother
may
not
quite
like
the
budget
will
do
all
i
can
for
her
answered
maulevrier
would
do
a
great
deal
to
save
her
from
the
degradation
to
which
your
teaching
has
brought
her
lady
kirkbank
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
or
so
with
reproachful
eyes
and
then
shrugged
her
shoulders
contemptuously
i
ever
expected
gratitude
from
people
i
might
feel
the
injustice
the
insolence
of
your
last
remark
she
said
as
i
never
do
expect
gratitude
i
am
not
disappointed
in
this
case
and
now
i
think
if
there
is
a
cabin
which
i
can
have
to
myself
i
should
like
to
retire
to
it
she
added
cares
are
thrown
away
here
there
was
a
cabin
at
lady
kirkbank
disposal
it
had
been
already
appropriated
by
rilboche
and
smelt
of
cognac
but
rilboche
resigned
her
berth
to
her
mistress
and
laid
herself
meekly
on
the
floor
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
they
were
in
cowes
roads
at
eight
next
morning
and
lord
hartfield
went
on
shore
for
a
doctor
whom
he
brought
back
before
nine
and
who
pronounced
lady
lesbia
to
be
in
a
very
weak
and
prostrate
condition
and
forbade
her
being
moved
within
the
next
two
days
happily
lord
hartfield
had
borrowed
the
and
her
crew
from
a
friend
who
had
given
him
as
to
the
use
he
made
of
her
and
who
freely
left
her
at
his
disposal
so
long
as
he
and
his
party
should
need
the
accommodation
lesbia
could
nowhere
be
better
off
than
on
the
yacht
where
she
was
away
from
the
gossip
and
of
the
town
the
roadstead
was
quiet
enough
now
all
the
racing
yachts
had
melted
away
like
a
dream
and
most
of
the
pleasure
yachts
were
off
to
ryde
lady
lesbia
lay
in
her
curtained
cabin
with
kibble
keeping
watch
beside
her
bed
while
maulevrier
came
in
every
to
see
how
she
was
sitting
by
her
a
little
now
and
then
and
talking
of
indifferent
things
in
a
low
kind
voice
which
was
full
of
comfort
she
seemed
grateful
for
his
kindness
and
smiled
at
him
once
in
a
way
with
a
piteous
little
smile
but
she
had
the
air
of
one
in
whom
the
mainspring
of
life
is
broken
the
pallid
face
and
heavy
violet
eyes
the
hands
which
lay
so
listlessly
upon
the
crimson
coverlet
conveyed
an
impression
of
supreme
despair
hartfield
looking
down
at
her
for
the
last
time
when
he
came
to
say
before
leaving
for
london
was
reminded
of
the
story
of
one
whose
life
had
been
thus
rudely
broken
who
had
loved
as
foolishly
and
even
more
fondly
and
for
whom
the
world
held
nothing
when
that
tie
was
severed
looked
on
many
a
face
with
vacant
eye
on
many
a
token
without
knowing
what
she
saw
them
watch
her
without
asking
why
and
recked
not
who
around
her
pillow
sat
but
lesbia
haselden
belonged
to
a
wider
and
more
sophisticated
world
than
that
of
the
daughter
of
the
grecian
isle
and
for
her
existence
offered
wider
horizons
it
might
be
prophesied
that
for
her
the
dark
ending
of
a
girlish
dream
would
not
be
a
despair
the
passionate
love
had
been
at
fever
point
the
passionate
grief
must
have
its
fever
too
and
burn
itself
out
all
you
can
to
cheer
her
said
lord
hartfield
to
maulevrier
bring
her
to
fellside
as
soon
as
ever
she
is
strong
enough
to
bear
the
journey
you
and
kibble
with
your
own
man
will
be
able
to
do
all
that
is
necessary
able
right
i
must
be
in
the
house
for
the
expected
division
and
i
shall
go
back
to
grasmere
morning
poor
mary
is
horribly
lonely
lord
hartfield
went
off
in
the
boat
to
catch
the
southampton
steamer
and
maulevrier
was
now
sole
custodian
of
the
yacht
and
of
his
sister
he
and
the
doctor
had
agreed
to
keep
her
on
board
in
the
fresh
sea
air
till
she
was
equal
to
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
to
grasmere
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
taking
her
on
to
the
island
or
by
carrying
her
to
london
the
yacht
was
well
found
provided
with
all
things
needful
for
comfort
and
lesbia
could
be
nowhere
better
off
until
she
was
safe
in
her
old
home
that
home
she
had
left
so
gaily
in
the
freshness
of
her
youthful
inexperience
nearly
a
year
ago
and
to
which
she
would
return
so
battered
and
broken
so
deeply
degraded
by
the
knowledge
of
evil
lady
kirkbank
had
started
for
london
on
the
previous
day
am
evidently
not
wanted
she
said
with
an
offended
air
i
must
have
everything
at
kirkbank
ready
for
a
house
full
of
people
before
the
twelfth
of
august
so
the
sooner
i
get
to
scotland
the
better
i
shall
make
a
in
order
to
go
and
see
lady
maulevrier
on
my
way
down
it
is
due
to
myself
that
i
should
let
her
know
that
am
entirely
blameless
in
this
most
uncomfortable
business
can
tell
her
ladyship
what
you
please
answered
maulevrier
bluntly
shall
not
gainsay
you
so
long
as
you
do
not
slander
my
sister
but
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
regret
that
i
knowing
something
of
london
society
did
not
interfere
to
prevent
lesbia
being
given
over
to
your
keeping
i
had
known
the
kind
of
girl
she
is
i
would
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
retorted
lady
kirkbank
with
exasperation
and
so
they
parted
the
had
been
lying
off
cowes
three
days
before
smithson
appeared
upon
the
scene
he
had
got
wind
somehow
from
a
sailor
who
had
talked
with
one
of
the
foreign
crew
of
the
destination
of
the
and
he
had
crossed
from
southampton
to
havre
on
the
steamer
during
that
night
in
which
lesbia
had
been
carried
back
to
cowes
on
the
he
was
at
havre
when
the
arrived
with
montesma
and
his
crew
on
board
no
one
else
may
examine
every
corner
of
your
ship
montesma
cried
scornfully
when
smithson
came
on
board
and
swore
that
lesbia
must
be
hidden
somewhere
in
the
vessel
bird
has
flown
she
will
shelter
in
neither
your
nest
nor
in
mine
smithson
you
have
lost
her
and
so
have
i
we
may
as
well
be
friends
in
misfortune
he
was
haggard
livid
with
grief
and
anger
he
looked
ten
years
older
than
he
had
looked
the
other
night
at
the
ball
when
his
dash
and
swagger
and
handsome
spanish
head
had
been
the
admiration
of
the
room
smithson
was
very
angry
but
he
was
not
a
fighting
man
he
had
enjoyed
various
opportunities
for
distinguishing
himself
in
that
line
in
the
island
of
cuba
but
he
had
always
avoided
such
opportunities
so
now
after
a
good
deal
of
bluster
and
violent
language
which
montesma
took
as
lightly
as
if
it
had
been
the
whistling
of
the
wind
in
the
shrouds
poor
smithson
calmed
down
and
allowed
gomez
de
montesma
to
leave
the
yacht
with
his
portmanteaux
unharmed
he
meant
to
take
the
first
steamer
for
the
spanish
main
he
told
smithson
he
had
had
quite
enough
of
europe
daresay
it
will
end
in
your
marrying
her
he
said
at
the
last
moment
you
do
be
kind
to
her
his
voice
faltered
choked
by
a
sob
at
those
last
words
after
all
it
is
possible
for
a
man
without
principle
without
morality
to
begin
to
make
love
to
a
woman
in
a
mere
spirit
of
adventure
in
sheer
devilry
and
to
be
rather
hard
hit
at
the
last
horace
smithson
sailed
his
yacht
back
to
cowes
without
loss
of
time
and
sent
his
card
to
lord
maulevrier
on
board
the
his
lordship
replied
that
he
would
wait
upon
smithson
that
afternoon
at
four
and
at
that
hour
maulevrier
again
boarded
the
but
this
time
very
quietly
as
an
expected
guest
the
interview
that
followed
was
very
painful
smithson
was
willing
that
this
unhappy
episode
in
the
life
of
his
betrothed
this
folly
into
which
she
had
been
beguiled
by
a
man
of
infinite
treachery
a
man
of
all
other
men
fatal
to
women
should
be
forgotten
should
be
as
if
it
had
never
been
was
her
very
innocence
which
made
her
a
victim
to
that
scoundrel
said
smithson
girlish
simplicity
and
lady
kirkbank
folly
but
i
love
your
sister
too
well
to
sacrifice
her
lightly
lord
maulevrier
and
if
she
can
forget
this
midsummer
madness
why
so
can
i
can
not
forget
smithson
answered
maulevrier
gravely
has
done
you
a
great
wrong
by
listening
to
your
false
addresses
but
she
did
you
a
still
greater
wrong
when
she
accepted
you
as
her
husband
without
one
spark
of
love
for
you
she
and
you
are
both
happy
in
having
escaped
the
degradation
the
deep
misery
of
a
loveless
union
i
am
glad
yes
glad
even
of
this
shameful
escapade
with
montesma
though
it
has
dragged
her
good
name
through
the
gutter
glad
of
the
catastrophe
that
has
saved
her
from
such
a
marriage
you
are
very
generous
in
your
willingness
to
forget
my
sister
folly
let
your
forgetfulness
go
a
step
further
and
forget
that
you
ever
met
her
can
not
be
lord
maulevrier
she
has
ruined
my
life
at
all
an
affair
of
a
season
answered
maulevrier
lightly
year
i
shall
hear
of
you
as
the
accepted
husband
of
some
new
beauty
a
man
of
smithson
wealth
and
good
nature
need
not
languish
in
single
blessedness
with
this
civil
speech
lord
maulevrier
went
back
to
the
gig
and
this
was
his
last
meeting
with
smithson
until
they
met
a
year
later
in
the
beaten
tracks
of
society
chapter
xlv
fell
arrest
without
all
bail
it
was
the
beginning
of
august
before
lesbia
was
pronounced
equal
to
the
fatigue
of
a
long
journey
and
even
then
it
was
but
the
shadow
of
her
former
self
which
returned
to
fellside
the
pale
spectre
of
joys
departed
of
trust
deceived
maulevrier
had
been
very
good
to
her
patient
unselfish
as
a
woman
in
his
ministering
to
the
girl
that
broken
heart
would
be
whole
again
no
doubt
in
the
future
as
many
other
broken
hearts
have
been
but
the
grief
the
despair
the
sense
of
hopelessness
and
aimlessness
in
life
were
very
real
in
the
present
if
the
picturesque
seclusion
of
fellside
had
seemed
dull
and
joyless
to
lesbia
in
days
gone
by
it
was
much
duller
to
her
now
she
was
shocked
at
the
change
in
her
grandmother
and
she
showed
a
good
deal
of
feeling
and
affection
in
her
intercourse
with
the
invalid
but
once
out
of
her
presence
lady
maulevrier
was
forgotten
and
lesbia
thoughts
drifted
back
into
the
old
current
they
dwelt
obstinately
unceasingly
upon
montesma
the
man
whose
influence
had
awakened
the
slumbering
soul
from
its
torpor
had
stirred
the
deeps
of
a
passionate
nature
gambler
adventurer
liar
his
name
blackened
by
the
suspicion
of
a
still
darker
crime
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
villain
from
whose
snare
she
had
been
rescued
and
yet
his
image
as
he
had
been
to
her
in
the
brief
golden
time
when
she
believed
him
noble
and
chivalrous
and
true
haunted
her
lonely
days
mixed
itself
with
her
troubled
dreams
came
between
her
and
every
other
thought
everybody
was
good
to
her
that
pale
and
joyless
face
that
look
of
patient
hopeless
suffering
which
she
tried
to
disguise
every
now
and
then
with
a
faint
forced
smile
and
silvery
little
ripple
of
society
laughter
seemed
unconsciously
to
implore
pity
and
pardon
lady
maulevrier
uttered
no
word
of
reproach
dearest
fate
has
not
been
kind
to
you
she
said
gently
after
telling
lesbia
of
lady
visit
handsomest
women
are
seldom
the
happiest
destiny
seems
to
have
a
grudge
against
them
and
if
things
have
gone
amiss
it
is
i
who
am
most
to
blame
i
ought
never
to
have
entrusted
you
with
such
a
woman
as
georgina
kirkbank
but
you
will
be
happier
next
season
i
hope
dearest
you
can
live
with
mary
and
hartfield
they
will
take
care
of
you
lesbia
shuddered
you
think
i
am
going
back
to
the
society
treadmill
she
exclaimed
i
have
done
with
the
world
i
shall
end
my
days
here
or
in
a
convent
think
so
now
dear
but
you
will
change
your
mind
a
fancy
that
has
lasted
only
a
few
weeks
can
not
alter
your
life
it
will
pass
as
other
dreams
have
passed
at
your
age
you
have
the
future
before
you
it
is
the
past
that
is
always
before
me
answered
lesbia
future
is
a
blank
the
bills
came
pouring
in
dressmaker
milliner
glover
bootmaker
tailor
stationer
perfumer
awful
bills
which
made
lady
blood
run
cold
so
degrading
was
their
story
of
selfish
of
senseless
extravagance
but
she
paid
them
all
without
a
word
she
took
upon
her
shoulders
the
chief
burden
of
lesbia
wrongdoing
it
was
her
indulgence
her
weak
preference
which
had
fostered
her
granddaughter
selfishness
trained
her
to
vanity
and
worldly
pride
the
result
was
ignominious
humiliating
bitter
beyond
all
common
bitterness
but
the
cup
was
of
her
own
brewing
and
she
drank
it
without
a
murmur
parliament
was
prorogued
the
season
was
over
and
lord
hartfield
was
established
at
fellside
for
the
autumn
he
and
his
wife
utterly
happy
in
their
affection
for
each
other
but
not
without
care
as
to
their
surroundings
which
were
full
of
trouble
first
there
was
sorrow
granted
that
it
was
a
grief
which
would
inevitably
wear
itself
out
as
other
such
griefs
have
done
from
time
immemorial
but
still
the
sorrow
was
there
at
their
doors
next
there
was
the
state
of
lady
maulevrier
health
which
gave
her
old
medical
adviser
the
gravest
fears
at
lord
hartfield
earnest
desire
a
famous
doctor
was
summoned
from
london
but
the
great
man
could
only
confirm
horton
verdict
the
thread
of
life
was
wearing
thinner
every
day
it
might
snap
at
any
hour
in
the
meantime
the
only
regime
was
repose
of
body
and
mind
an
calm
the
avoidance
of
all
exciting
topics
one
moment
of
violent
agitation
might
prove
fatal
knowing
this
how
could
lord
hartfield
call
her
ladyship
to
account
for
the
presence
of
that
mysterious
old
man
under
steadman
charge
how
venture
to
touch
upon
a
topic
which
by
mary
showing
had
exercised
a
most
disturbing
influence
upon
her
ladyship
mind
on
that
solitary
occasion
when
the
girl
ventured
to
approach
the
subject
he
felt
that
any
attempt
at
an
explanation
was
impossible
it
was
not
for
him
to
precipitate
lady
maulevrier
end
by
prying
into
her
secrets
granted
that
shame
and
dishonour
of
some
kind
were
involved
in
the
existence
of
that
strange
old
man
he
lord
hartfield
must
endure
his
portion
in
that
shame
must
be
content
to
leave
the
dark
riddle
unsolved
he
resigned
himself
to
this
state
of
things
and
tried
to
forget
the
cloud
that
hung
over
the
house
of
haselden
but
the
sense
of
a
mystery
a
fatal
family
secret
which
must
come
to
light
sooner
or
later
since
all
such
secrets
are
known
at
last
known
sifted
and
bandied
about
from
lip
to
lip
and
published
in
a
thousand
different
newspapers
and
cried
aloud
in
the
streets
the
sense
of
such
a
secret
the
dread
of
such
a
revelation
weighed
upon
him
heavily
maulevrier
the
restless
was
off
to
argyleshire
for
the
grouse
shooting
as
soon
as
he
had
deposited
lady
lesbia
comfortably
at
fellside
should
only
be
in
your
way
if
i
stopped
he
said
you
and
molly
have
hardly
got
over
the
honeymoon
stage
yet
though
you
put
on
the
airs
of
darby
and
joan
i
shall
be
back
in
a
week
or
ten
days
lady
maulevrier
state
of
health
i
do
think
you
ought
to
stay
away
very
long
said
hartfield
lady
maulevrier
she
never
cared
much
for
me
do
you
know
but
i
suppose
it
would
seem
unkind
if
i
were
to
be
out
of
the
way
when
the
end
comes
the
end
good
heavens
how
coolly
i
talk
of
it
and
a
year
ago
i
thought
she
was
as
immortal
as
fairfield
yonder
he
went
away
his
spirits
dashed
by
that
awful
thought
of
death
and
lord
and
lady
hartfield
had
the
house
to
themselves
since
lesbia
hardly
counted
she
seldom
left
her
own
rooms
except
to
sit
with
her
grandmother
for
an
hour
she
lay
on
her
sofa
or
sat
in
a
low
by
the
window
reading
keats
or
shelley
or
only
dreaming
dreaming
over
the
brief
golden
time
of
her
life
with
its
fond
delusions
its
false
brightness
horton
went
to
see
her
every
day
felt
the
feeble
little
pulse
which
seemed
hardly
to
have
force
enough
to
beat
urged
her
to
struggle
against
apathy
and
inertia
to
walk
a
little
to
go
for
a
long
drive
every
day
to
live
in
the
open
air
to
which
instructions
she
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
the
desire
for
life
was
gone
disappointed
in
her
ambition
betrayed
in
her
love
humiliated
duped
degraded
a
social
failure
what
had
she
to
live
for
she
felt
as
if
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
quite
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
if
she
could
turn
her
face
to
the
wall
and
die
all
that
past
season
its
triumphs
its
pleasures
its
varieties
was
like
a
garish
dream
a
horror
to
look
back
upon
hateful
to
remember
in
vain
did
mary
and
hartfield
urge
lesbia
to
join
in
their
simple
pleasures
their
walks
and
rides
and
drives
and
boating
excursions
she
always
refused
know
i
never
cared
much
for
roaming
about
these
everlasting
hills
she
told
mary
never
had
your
passion
for
lakeland
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
wish
to
have
me
but
it
is
quite
impossible
i
have
hardly
strength
enough
for
a
little
walk
in
the
garden
would
have
more
strength
if
you
went
out
more
pleaded
mary
almost
with
tears
horton
says
sun
and
wind
are
the
best
doctors
for
you
lesbia
you
frighten
me
sometimes
you
are
just
letting
yourself
fade
away
you
knew
how
i
hate
the
world
and
the
sky
mary
you
would
urge
me
to
go
out
of
doors
lesbia
answered
moodily
i
can
read
and
get
away
from
my
own
thoughts
somehow
for
a
little
while
but
out
yonder
face
to
face
with
the
hills
and
the
lake
the
scenes
i
have
known
all
my
life
i
feel
a
that
is
worse
than
death
it
maddens
me
to
see
that
old
old
picture
of
mountain
and
water
the
same
for
ever
and
ever
no
matter
what
hearts
are
breaking
mary
crept
close
beside
her
sister
couch
put
her
arm
round
her
neck
laid
her
cheek
rich
in
the
ruddy
bloom
of
health
against
pallid
and
sunken
cheek
and
comforted
her
as
much
as
she
could
with
tender
murmurs
and
loving
kisses
other
comfort
she
could
give
none
all
the
wisdom
in
the
world
will
not
cure
a
girl
when
she
has
flung
away
the
treasures
of
her
love
upon
a
worthless
object
and
so
the
days
went
by
peacefully
but
sadly
for
the
shadow
of
doom
hung
heavily
over
the
house
upon
the
fell
nobody
who
looked
upon
lady
maulevrier
could
doubt
that
her
days
were
numbered
that
the
oil
was
waxing
low
in
the
lamp
of
life
the
end
the
awful
mysterious
end
was
drawing
near
and
she
who
was
called
was
making
no
such
preparations
as
the
christian
makes
to
answer
the
dread
summons
as
she
had
lived
she
meant
to
die
an
avowed
unbeliever
more
than
once
mary
had
taken
courage
and
had
talked
to
her
grandmother
of
the
world
beyond
the
blessed
hope
of
with
the
friends
we
have
lost
in
a
new
and
brighter
life
only
to
be
met
by
the
sceptic
cynical
smile
the
materialist
barren
creed
dearest
we
know
nothing
except
the
immutable
laws
of
material
life
all
the
rest
is
a
dream
a
beautiful
dream
if
you
like
a
consolation
to
that
kind
of
temperament
which
can
take
comfort
from
dreams
but
for
anyone
who
has
read
much
and
thought
much
and
kept
as
far
as
possible
on
a
level
with
the
scientific
intellect
of
the
age
for
such
an
one
mary
these
old
fables
are
too
idle
i
shall
die
as
i
have
lived
the
victim
of
an
inscrutable
destiny
working
blindly
evil
to
some
good
to
others
ah
love
life
has
begun
very
fairly
for
you
may
the
fates
be
kind
always
to
my
gentle
and
loving
girl
there
was
more
talk
between
them
on
this
dark
mystery
of
life
and
death
mary
brought
out
her
poor
little
arguments
glorified
by
the
light
of
perfect
faith
but
they
were
of
no
avail
against
opinions
which
had
been
the
gradual
growth
of
a
long
and
joyless
life
time
had
attuned
lady
maulevrier
mind
to
the
gospel
of
schopenhauer
and
the
pessimists
and
she
was
contented
to
see
the
mystery
of
life
as
they
had
seen
it
she
had
no
fear
but
she
had
some
anxiety
as
to
the
things
that
were
to
happen
after
she
was
gone
she
had
taken
upon
herself
a
heavy
burden
and
she
had
not
yet
come
to
the
end
of
the
road
where
her
burden
might
be
laid
quietly
down
her
task
accomplished
if
she
fell
by
the
wayside
under
her
load
the
consequences
for
the
survivors
might
be
full
of
trouble
her
anxieties
were
increased
by
the
fact
that
her
faithful
servant
and
adviser
james
steadman
was
no
longer
the
man
he
had
been
the
change
in
him
was
painfully
evident
memory
failing
energy
gone
he
came
to
his
mistress
room
every
morning
received
her
orders
answered
her
questions
but
lady
maulevrier
felt
that
he
went
through
the
old
duties
in
a
mechanical
way
and
that
his
dull
brain
but
half
understood
their
importance
one
evening
at
dusk
just
as
hartfield
and
mary
were
leaving
lady
maulevrier
room
after
dinner
an
appalling
shriek
ran
through
the
house
a
cry
almost
as
terrible
as
that
which
lord
hartfield
heard
in
the
summer
midnight
just
a
year
ago
but
this
time
the
sound
came
from
the
old
part
of
the
house
has
happened
exclaimed
hartfield
rushing
to
the
door
of
communication
it
was
bolted
inside
he
knocked
vehemently
but
there
was
no
answer
he
ran
downstairs
followed
by
mary
breathless
in
an
agony
of
fear
just
as
they
approached
the
lower
door
leading
to
the
old
house
it
was
flung
open
and
steadman
wife
stood
before
them
pale
with
terror
doctor
she
cried
for
horton
somebody
for
god
sake
oh
my
lord
with
a
sudden
burst
of
sobbing
afraid
he
dead
despatch
some
one
for
horton
said
lord
hartfield
keeping
his
wife
back
with
one
hand
he
closed
the
door
against
her
and
then
followed
steadman
through
the
long
low
corridor
to
her
james
steadman
was
lying
upon
his
back
upon
the
hearth
near
the
spot
were
lord
hartfield
had
seen
him
sleeping
in
his
a
month
ago
one
look
at
the
distorted
face
dark
with
injected
blood
the
dreadful
glassy
glare
of
the
eyes
the
lips
told
that
all
was
over
the
faithful
servant
had
died
at
his
post
whatever
his
charge
had
been
his
term
of
service
was
ended
there
was
a
vacancy
in
lady
household
chapter
xlvi
the
day
of
reckoning
lord
hartfield
stayed
with
the
frightened
wife
while
she
knelt
beside
that
awful
figure
on
the
hearth
wringing
her
hands
with
piteous
bewailings
and
lamentations
over
the
unconscious
clay
he
had
always
been
a
good
husband
to
her
she
murmured
hard
and
stern
perhaps
but
a
good
man
and
she
had
obeyed
him
without
a
question
whatever
he
did
or
said
she
had
counted
right
have
not
had
a
happy
life
though
there
are
many
who
have
envied
us
her
ladyship
favour
she
said
in
the
midst
of
her
lamentations
one
knows
where
the
shoe
pinches
but
those
who
have
to
wear
it
poor
james
early
and
late
early
and
late
studying
her
interests
caring
and
thinking
in
order
to
keep
trouble
away
from
her
always
on
the
watch
always
on
the
listen
that
what
wore
him
out
poor
fellow
good
soul
your
husband
was
an
old
man
argued
lord
hartfield
in
a
consolatory
tone
the
end
must
come
to
all
of
us
somehow
might
have
lived
to
be
a
much
older
man
if
he
had
had
less
worry
said
the
wife
bending
her
face
to
kiss
the
cold
dead
brow
days
were
full
of
care
we
should
have
been
happier
in
the
poorest
cottage
in
grasmere
than
we
ever
were
in
this
big
grand
house
thus
in
broken
fragments
of
speech
steadman
lamented
over
her
dead
while
the
heavy
pendulum
of
the
clock
in
the
hall
sounded
the
moments
until
the
coming
of
the
doctor
broke
upon
the
quiet
of
the
house
with
the
noise
of
opening
doors
and
approaching
footsteps
james
steadman
was
dead
medicine
could
do
nothing
for
that
lifeless
clay
lying
on
the
hearth
by
which
he
had
sat
on
so
many
winter
nights
for
so
many
years
of
faithful
unquestioning
service
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
that
stiffening
form
save
the
last
offices
for
the
dead
and
lord
hartfield
left
horton
to
arrange
with
the
weeping
woman
as
to
the
doing
of
these
he
was
anxious
to
go
to
lady
maulevrier
to
break
to
her
as
gently
as
might
be
the
news
of
her
servant
death
and
what
of
that
strange
old
man
in
the
upper
rooms
who
was
to
attend
upon
him
now
that
the
caretaker
was
laid
low
while
lord
hartfield
lingered
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
that
led
from
the
old
house
to
the
new
pondering
this
question
there
came
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
carriage
drive
and
then
a
loud
ring
at
the
hall
door
it
was
maulevrier
just
arrived
from
scotland
smelling
of
autumn
rain
and
cool
fresh
air
bored
on
the
moors
he
said
as
they
shook
hands
birds
nobody
to
talk
to
could
stand
it
any
longer
how
are
the
sisters
lesbia
better
why
man
alive
how
queer
you
look
nothing
amiss
i
hope
there
is
something
very
much
amiss
steadman
is
dead
her
ladyship
right
hand
that
rather
bad
but
you
will
drop
into
his
stewardship
she
trust
your
long
head
i
know
much
better
that
she
should
look
to
her
granddaughter
husband
for
advice
in
all
business
matters
than
to
a
servant
when
did
it
happen
an
hour
ago
i
was
just
going
to
lady
maulevrier
room
when
you
rang
the
bell
take
off
your
inverness
and
come
with
me
poor
grandmother
muttered
maulevrier
afraid
it
will
be
a
blow
he
had
much
less
cause
for
fear
than
lord
hartfield
who
knew
of
deep
and
secret
reasons
why
steadman
death
should
be
a
calamity
of
dire
import
for
his
mistress
maulevrier
had
been
told
nothing
of
that
scene
with
the
strange
old
man
the
hidden
treasures
the
phrases
which
had
filled
lord
hartfield
mind
with
the
darkest
doubts
if
that
old
man
described
by
lady
maulevrier
as
a
kinsman
of
steadman
were
verily
the
person
lord
hartfield
believed
his
presence
under
that
roof
unguarded
by
a
attendant
was
fraught
with
danger
it
would
be
for
lady
maulevrier
helpless
a
prisoner
to
her
sofa
at
death
door
to
face
that
danger
the
very
thought
of
it
might
kill
her
and
yet
it
was
imperative
that
the
truth
should
be
told
her
without
delay
the
two
young
men
went
to
her
ladyship
sitting
room
she
was
alone
a
volume
of
her
favourite
schopenhauer
open
before
her
under
the
light
of
the
shaded
sorry
comfort
in
the
hour
of
trouble
maulevrier
went
over
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
then
dropped
silently
into
a
chair
near
at
hand
his
face
in
shadow
hartfield
seated
himself
nearer
the
sofa
and
nearer
the
lamp
lady
maulevrier
i
have
come
to
tell
you
some
very
bad
news
exclaimed
her
ladyship
with
a
frightened
look
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
lesbia
it
is
about
your
old
servant
steadman
faltered
lady
maulevrier
ashy
pale
as
she
looked
at
him
in
the
lamplight
he
bent
his
head
affirmatively
he
was
seized
with
apoplexy
fell
from
his
chair
to
the
hearth
and
never
spoke
or
stirred
again
lady
maulevrier
uttered
no
word
of
sorrow
or
surprise
she
lay
looking
straight
before
her
into
vacancy
the
pale
attenuated
features
rigid
as
if
they
had
been
marble
what
was
to
be
done
what
must
be
told
whom
could
she
trust
those
were
the
questions
repeating
themselves
in
her
mind
as
she
stared
into
space
and
no
answer
came
to
them
no
answer
came
except
the
opening
of
the
door
opposite
her
couch
the
handle
turned
slowly
hesitatingly
as
if
moved
by
feeble
fingers
and
then
the
door
was
pushed
slowly
open
and
an
old
man
came
with
shuffling
footsteps
towards
the
one
lighted
spot
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
was
the
old
man
lord
hartfield
had
last
seen
gloating
over
his
treasury
of
gold
and
jewels
the
man
whom
maulevrier
had
never
seen
whose
existence
for
forty
years
had
been
hidden
from
every
creature
in
that
house
except
lady
maulevrier
and
the
steadmans
until
mary
found
her
way
into
the
old
garden
he
came
close
up
to
the
little
table
in
front
of
lady
couch
and
looked
down
at
her
a
strange
uncanny
being
withered
and
bent
with
pale
faded
eyes
in
which
there
was
a
glimmer
of
unholy
light
to
you
lady
maulevrier
he
said
in
a
mocking
voice
should
have
known
you
if
we
had
met
anywhere
else
i
think
of
the
two
of
us
you
are
more
changed
than
i
she
looked
up
at
him
her
features
quivering
her
haughty
head
drawn
back
as
a
bird
shrinks
from
the
gaze
of
a
snake
recoiling
but
too
fascinated
to
fly
her
eyes
met
his
with
a
look
of
unutterable
horror
for
some
moments
she
was
speechless
and
then
looking
at
lord
hartfield
she
said
piteously
did
you
let
him
come
here
he
ought
to
be
taken
care
of
shut
up
it
is
steadman
old
uncle
a
lunatic
i
sheltered
why
is
he
allowed
to
come
to
my
room
am
lord
maulevrier
said
the
old
man
drawing
himself

looking
from

to
her
grandson
and
then
with
a
look
of
loathing
and
horror
at
her
accuser
tell

young
man

the
accuser

while

for

grandfather
died
at
the
inn
at
great
langdale
faltered
maulevrier
grandfather
was
brought
to
this
house
ill
out
of
his
wits
all
cloud
and
darkness
here
said
the
old
man
touching
his
forehead
long
has
it
been
who
can
tell
a
weary
time
long
dark
nights
full
of
ghosts
yes
i
have
seen
him
the
rajah
that
scoundrel
seen
him
as
she
told
me
he
looked
when
she
gave
the
signal
to
her
slaves
to
strangle
him
there
in
the
hall
where
the
grave
was
dug
ready
for
the
traitor
carcass
she
too
yes
she
has
haunted
me
calling
upon
me
to
give
up
her
treasure
to
restore
her
son
cried
the
paralytic
woman
suddenly
lifted
out
of
herself
as
it
were
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
every
feature
convulsed
every
nerve
strained
to
its
utmost
tension
this
is
lord
maulevrier
you
have
heard
the
truth
and
from
his
own
lips
you
his
only
son
only
son
you
his
granddaughter
husband
you
hear
him
avow
himself
the
instigator
of
a
diabolical
murder
you
hear
him
confess
how
his
paramour
husband
was
strangled
at
his
false
wife
bidding
in
his
own
palace
buried
under
the
moorish
pavement
in
the
hall
of
many
arches
you
hear
how
he
inherited
the
rajah
treasures
from
a
mistress
who
died
strangely
swiftly
conveniently
as
soon
so
he
had
wearied
of
her
and
a
new
favourite
had
begun
to
exercise
her
influence
such
things
are
done
in
the
east
dynasties
annihilated
kingdoms
overthrown
poison
or
bowstring
used
at
will
to
gratify
a
profligate
passion
or
pay
for
a
spendthrift
extravagances
such
things
were
done
when
that
man
was
governor
of
madras
as
were
never
done
by
an
englishman
in
india
before
his
time
he
went
there
fettered
by
no
prejudices
he
was
more
mussulman
than
the
mussulmen
themselves
a
deeper
darker
traitor
and
it
was
to
hide
such
crimes
as
these
to
interpose
the
great
peacemaker
death
between
him
and
the
government
which
was
resolved
upon
punishing
him
to
save
the
honour
the
fortune
of
my
son
and
the
children
who
were
to
come
after
him
the
name
of
a
noble
race
a
name
that
was
ever
stainless
until
he
defiled
it
it
was
for
this
great
end
i
took
steps
to
hide
that
feeble
useless
life
of
his
from
the
world
he
had
offended
it
was
for
this
end
that
i
caused
a
peasant
to
be
buried
in
the
vault
of
the
maulevriers
with
all
the
pomp
and
ceremony
that
befits
the
funeral
of
one
of
england
oldest
earls
i
screened
him
from
his
enemies
i
saved
him
from
the
ignominy
of
a
public
trial
from
the
execration
of
his
countrymen
his
only
punishment
was
to
eat
his
heart
under
this
roof
in
luxurious
seclusion
his
comfort
studied
his
whims
gratified
so
far
as
they
could
be
by
the
most
faithful
of
servants
a
light
penance
for
the
dark
infamies
of
his
life
in
india
i
think
his
mind
was
all
but
gone
when
he
came
here
but
he
had
his
rational
intervals
and
in
these
the
burden
of
his
lonely
life
may
have
weighed
heavily
upon
him
but
it
was
not
such
a
heavy
burden
as
i
have
borne
i
his
gaoler
i
who
have
devoted
my
existence
to
the
one
task
of
guarding
the
family
honour
he
whom
she
thus
acknowledged
as
her
husband
had
sunk
exhausted
into
a
chair
near
her
he
took
out
his
gold
and
refreshed
himself
with
a
leisurely
pinch
of
snuff
looking
about
him
curiously
all
the
while
with
a
senile
grin
that
flash
of
passion
which
for
a
few
minutes
had
restored
him
to
the
full
possession
of
his
reason
had
burnt
itself
out
and
his
mind
had
relapsed
into
the
condition
in
which
it
had
been
when
he
talked
to
mary
in
the
garden
pipe
steadman
he
said
looking
towards
the
door
me
my
pipe
and
then
impatiently
has
become
of
steadman
he
has
been
getting
inattentive
very
inattentive
he
got
up
and
moved
slowly
to
the
door
leaning
on
his
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
muttering
to
himself
as
he
went
and
thus
he
vanished
from
them
like
the
spectre
of
some
terrible
ancestor
which
had
returned
from
the
grave
to
announce
the
coming
of
calamity
to
a
doomed
race
his
grandson
looked
after
him
with
an
expression
of
intense
displeasure
so
lady
maulevrier
he
exclaimed
turning
to
his
grandmother
have
borne
a
title
that
never
belonged
to
me
and
enjoyed
the
possession
of
another
man
estates
all
this
time
thanks
to
your
pretty
little
plot
a
very
respectable
position
for
your
grandson
to
occupy
upon
my
life
lord
hartfield
lifted
his
hand
with
a
warning
gesture
her
he
said
is
in
no
condition
to
endure
your
reproaches
spare
her
yes
fate
had
not
spared
her
the
beautiful
face
beautiful
even
in
age
and
decay
changed
suddenly
as
she
looked
at
them
the
mouth
became
distorted
the
eyes
fixed
and
then
the
heavy
head
fell
back
upon
the
pillow
the
paralysed
form
wholly
paralysed
now
lay
like
a
thing
of
stone
it
never
moved
again
consciousness
was
blotted
out
for
ever
in
that
moment
the
feeble
pulses
of
heart
and
brain
throbbed
with
gradually
diminishing
power
for
a
night
and
a
day
and
in
the
twilight
of
that
dreadful
day
of
nothingness
the
last
glimmer
of
the
light
died
in
the
lamp
and
lady
maulevrier
and
the
burden
of
her
sin
were
beyond
the
veil
viscount
haselden
lord
maulevrier
held
a
long
consultation
with
lord
hartfield
on
the
night
of
his
grandmother
death
as
to
what
steps
ought
to
be
taken
in
relation
to
the
real
earl
of
maulevrier
and
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
a
serious
and
earnest
discussion
that
both
young
men
came
to
the
decision
that
lady
maulevrier
secret
ought
to
be
kept
faithfully
to
the
end
assuredly
no
good
purpose
could
be
achieved
by
letting
the
world
know
of
old
lord
maulevrier
existence
a
octogenarian
could
gain
nothing
by
being
restored
to
rights
and
possessions
which
he
had
most
justly
forfeited
all
that
justice
demanded
was
that
the
closing
years
of
his
life
should
be
made
as
comfortable
as
care
and
wealth
could
make
them
and
hartfield
and
haselden
took
immediate
steps
to
this
end
but
their
first
act
was
to
send
the
old
earl
treasure
chest
under
safe
convoy
to
the
india
house
with
a
letter
explaining
how
this
wealth
brought
from
india
by
lord
maulevrier
had
been
discovered
among
other
effects
in
a
at
lady
maulevrier
country
house
the
money
so
delivered
up
might
possibly
have
formed
part
of
his
lordship
private
fortune
but
in
the
absence
of
any
knowledge
as
to
its
origin
his
grandson
the
present
lord
maulevrier
preferred
to
deliver
it
up
to
the
authorities
of
the
india
house
to
be
dealt
with
as
they
might
think
fit
the
old
earl
made
no
further
attempt
to
assert
himself
he
seemed
content
to
remain
in
his
own
rooms
as
of
old
to
potter
about
the
garden
where
his
solitude
was
as
complete
as
that
of
a
hermit
cell
the
only
moan
be
made
was
for
james
steadman
whose
services
he
missed
sorely
lord
hartfield
replaced
that
devoted
servant
by
a
clever
austrian
valet
a
new
importation
from
vienna
who
understood
very
little
english
a
trained
attendant
upon
mental
invalids
and
who
was
quite
capable
of
dealing
with
old
lord
maulevrier
lord
hartfield
went
a
step
farther
and
within
a
week
of
those
two
funerals
of
servant
and
mistress
which
cast
a
gloom
over
the
peaceful
valley
of
grasmere
he
brought
down
a
famous
to
diagnose
his
lordship
case
there
was
but
little
risk
in
so
doing
he
argued
with
his
friend
and
it
was
their
duty
so
to
do
if
the
old
man
should
assert
himself
to
the
doctor
as
lord
maulevrier
the
declaration
would
pass
as
a
symptom
of
his
lunacy
but
it
happened
that
the
physician
arrived
at
fellside
on
one
of
lord
maulevrier
bad
days
and
the
patient
never
emerged
from
the
feeblest
phase
of
imbecility
quite
gone
pronounced
the
doctor
health
very
poor
take
him
to
the
south
of
france
for
the
winter
hyères
or
any
quiet
place
he
ca
last
long
to
hyères
the
old
man
was
taken
with
steadman
as
nurse
and
the
austrian
valet
as
and
keeper
mary
for
whom
in
his
brighter
hours
he
showed
a
warm
affection
went
with
him
under
her
husband
wing
lord
hartfield
rented
a
chateau
on
the
slope
of
an
hill
where
he
and
his
young
wife
whose
health
was
somewhat
delicate
at
this
time
spent
a
winter
in
peaceful
seclusion
while
lesbia
and
her
brother
travelled
together
in
italy
the
old
man
strength
improved
in
that
lovely
climate
he
lived
to
see
the
roses
and
orange
blossoms
of
the
early
spring
and
died
in
his
suddenly
without
a
pang
while
mary
sat
at
his
feet
reading
to
him
a
quiet
end
of
an
evil
and
troubled
life
and
now
he
whom
the
world
had
known
as
lord
maulevrier
was
verily
the
earl
and
could
hear
himself
called
by
his
title
once
more
without
a
touch
of
shame
the
secret
of
lady
maulevrier
sin
had
been
so
faithfully
kept
by
the
two
young
men
that
neither
of
her
granddaughters
knew
the
true
story
of
that
mysterious
person
whom
mary
had
first
heard
of
as
james
uncle
she
and
lesbia
both
knew
that
there
were
painful
circumstances
of
some
kind
connected
with
this
man
existence
his
hidden
life
in
the
old
house
at
fellside
but
they
were
both
content
to
learn
no
more
respect
for
their
grandmother
memory
sorrowful
affection
for
the
dead
prevailed
over
natural
curiosity
early
in
february
maulevrier
sent
decorators
and
upholsterers
into
the
old
house
in
curzon
street
which
was
ready
before
the
middle
of
may
to
receive
his
lordship
and
his
young
wife
the
girlish
daughter
of
a
florentine
nobleman
a
italian
with
a
voice
whose
every
tone
was
music
and
with
the
gentlest
shyest
most
engaging
manners
of
any
girl
in
florence
lady
lesbia
strangely
subdued
and
changed
by
the
griefs
and
humiliations
of
her
last
campaign
had
been
her
counsellor
and
confidante
throughout
his
wooing
of
his
fair
italian
bride
she
was
to
spend
the
season
under
her
brother
roof
to
help
to
initiate
young
lady
maulevrier
in
the
mysterious
rites
of
london
society
and
to
warn
her
of
those
rocks
and
shoals
which
had
wrecked
her
own
fortunes
the
month
of
may
brought
a
son
and
heir
to
lord
hartfield
and
it
was
not
till
after
his
birth
that
mary
countess
of
hartfield
was
presented
to
her
sovereign
and
began
her
career
as
a
matron
of
rank
and
standing
very
much
overpowered
by
the
weight
of
her
honours
and
looking
forward
with
delight
to
the
end
of
the
season
and
a
flight
to
argyleshire
with
her
husband
and
baby
the
end
