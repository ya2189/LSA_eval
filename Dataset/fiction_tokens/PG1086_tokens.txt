took
me
on
soldier
boy
to
at
that
file
of
cats
in
your
morning
they
go
clattering
down
into
the
was
nothing
to
do
but
stand
strength
failed
and
he
fell
at
her
acknowledgements
although
i
have
had
several
opportunities
to
see
a
i
have
never
seen
one
but
i
needed
a
in
this
book
and
a
trustworthy
one
will
be
found
in
it
i
got
it
out
of
john
reducing
and
condensing
it
to
fit
the
requirements
of
this
small
story
hay
and
i
were
friends
from
early
times
and
if
he
were
still
with
us
he
would
not
rebuke
me
for
the
liberty
i
have
taken
the
knowledge
of
military
minuti√¶
exhibited
in
this
book
will
be
found
to
be
correct
but
it
is
not
mine
i
took
it
from
ed
revised
and
handbook
of
military
west
point
it
would
not
be
honest
in
me
to
encourage
by
silence
the
inference
that
i
composed
the
private
for
i
did
not
i
lifted
it
as
aristotle
says
it
is
the
opening
strain
in
in
by
delibes
when
that
master
was
composing
it
he
did
not
know
it
was
a
it
was
i
that
found
it
out
along
through
the
book
i
have
distributed
a
few
anachronisms
and
unborn
historical
incidents
and
such
things
so
as
to
help
the
tale
over
the
difficult
places
this
idea
is
not
original
with
me
i
got
it
out
of
herodotus
herodotus
says
few
things
happen
at
the
right
time
and
the
rest
do
not
happen
at
all
the
conscientious
historian
will
correct
these
the
cats
in
the
chair
do
not
belong
to
me
but
to
another
these
are
all
the
exceptions
what
is
left
of
the
book
is

i
soldier
to
himself
i
am
buffalo
horse
i
have
spent
my
life
under
his
him
in
it
too
and
he
is
good
for
two
hundred
pounds
without
his
clothes
and
there
is
no
telling
how
much
he
does
weigh
when
he
is
out
on
the
and
has
his
batteries
belted
on
he
is
over
six
feet
is
young
an
ounce
of
waste
flesh
is
straight
graceful
springy
in
his
motions
quick
as
a
cat
and
has
a
handsome
face
and
black
hair
dangling
down
on
his
shoulders
and
is
beautiful
to
look
at
and
nobody
is
braver
than
he
is
and
nobody
is
stronger
except
myself
yes
a
person
that
doubts
that
he
is
fine
to
see
should
see
him
in
his
beaded
on
my
back
and
his
rifle
peeping
above
his
shoulder
chasing
a
hostile
trail
with
me
going
like
the
wind
and
his
hair
streaming
out
behind
from
the
shelter
of
his
broad
slouch
yes
he
is
a
sight
to
look
at
part
of
it
myself
i
am
his
favorite
horse
out
of
dozens
big
as
he
is
i
have
carried
him
miles
between
nightfall
and
sunrise
on
the
scout
and
i
am
good
for
fifty
day
in
and
day
out
and
all
the
time
i
am
not
large
but
i
am
built
on
a
business
basis
i
have
carried
him
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
on
scout
duty
for
the
army
and
not
a
gorge
nor
a
pass
nor
a
valley
nor
a
fort
nor
a
trading
post
nor
a
in
the
whole
sweep
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
great
plains
that
we
know
as
well
as
we
know
the
he
is
chief
of
scouts
to
the
army
of
the
frontier
and
it
makes
us
very
important
in
such
a
position
as
i
hold
in
the
military
service
one
needs
to
be
of
good
family
and
possess
an
education
much
above
the
common
to
be
worthy
of
the
place
i
am
the
horse
outside
of
the
hippodrome
everybody
says
and
the
it
may
be
so
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
modesty
is
the
best
policy
i
think
buffalo
bill
taught
me
the
most
of
what
i
know
my
mother
taught
me
much
and
i
taught
myself
the
rest
lay
a
row
of
moccasins
before
sioux
shoshone
cheyenne
blackfoot
and
as
many
other
tribes
as
you
i
can
name
the
tribe
every
moccasin
belongs
to
by
the
make
of
it
name
it
in
and
could
do
it
in
american
if
i
had
speech
i
know
some
of
the
indian
signs
they
make
with
their
hands
and
by
at
night
and
columns
of
smoke
by
day
buffalo
bill
taught
me
how
to
drag
wounded
soldiers
out
of
the
line
of
fire
with
my
teeth
and
done
it
too
at
least
dragged
out
of
the
battle
when
he
was
wounded
and
not
just
once
but
twice
yes
i
know
a
lot
of
things
i
remember
forms
and
gaits
and
faces
and
you
disguise
a
person
done
me
a
kindness
so
that
i
know
him
thereafter
wherever
i
find
him
i
know
the
art
of
searching
for
a
trail
and
i
know
the
stale
track
from
the
fresh
i
can
keep
a
trail
all
by
myself
with
buffalo
bill
asleep
in
the
saddle
ask
will
tell
you
so
many
a
time
when
he
has
ridden
all
night
he
has
said
to
me
at
dawn
the
watch
boy
if
the
trail
freshens
call
then
he
goes
to
sleep
he
knows
he
can
trust
me
because
i
have
a
reputation
a
scout
horse
that
has
a
reputation
does
not
play
with
it
my
mother
was
all
about
i
can
tell
you
she
was
of
the
best
blood
of
kentucky
the
bluest
aristocracy
very
proud
and
maybe
it
is
ceremonious
i
know
which
it
is
but
it
is
no
matter
size
is
the
main
thing
about
a
word
and
that
up
to
standard
she
spent
her
military
life
as
colonel
of
the
tenth
dragoons
and
saw
a
deal
of
rough
service
it
was
too
i
mean
she
the
colonel
but
all
the
same
where
would
he
be
without
his
horse
he
arrive
it
takes
two
to
make
a
colonel
of
dragoons
she
was
a
fine
dragoon
horse
but
never
got
above
that
she
was
strong
enough
for
the
scout
service
and
had
the
endurance
too
but
she
quite
come
up
to
the
speed
required
a
scout
horse
has
to
have
steel
in
his
muscle
and
lightning
in
his
blood
my
father
was
a
bronco
nothing
as
to
is
nothing
as
to
recent
plenty
good
enough
when
you
go
a
good
way
back
when
professor
marsh
was
out
here
hunting
bones
for
the
chapel
of
yale
university
he
found
skeletons
of
horses
no
bigger
than
a
fox
bedded
in
the
rocks
and
he
said
they
were
ancestors
of
my
father
my
mother
heard
him
say
it
and
he
said
those
skeletons
were
two
million
years
old
which
astonished
her
and
made
her
kentucky
pretensions
look
small
and
pretty
antiphonal
not
to
say
oblique
let
me
i
used
to
know
the
meaning
of
those
words
but
well
it
was
years
ago
and
as
vivid
now
as
it
was
when
they
were
fresh
that
sort
of
words
keep
in
the
kind
of
climate
we
have
out
here
professor
marsh
said
those
skeletons
were
fossils
so
that
makes
me
part
blue
grass
and
part
fossil
if
there
is
any
older
or
better
stock
you
will
have
to
look
for
it
among
the
four
hundred
i
reckon
i
am
satisfied
with
it
and
am
a
happy
horse
too
though
born
out
of
wedlock
and
now
we
are
back
at
fort
paxton
once
more
after
a
scout
away
up
as
far
as
the
big
horn
everything
quiet
crows
and
blackfeet
no
outbreaks
and
settlers
feeling
fairly
easy
the
seventh
cavalry
still
in
garrison
here
also
the
ninth
dragoons
two
artillery
companies
and
some
infantry
all
glad
to
see
me
including
general
alison
commandant
the
ladies
and
children
well
and
called
upon
sugar
colonel
drake
seventh
cavalry
said
some
pleasant
things
drake
was
very
complimentary
also
captain
and
marsh
company
b
seventh
cavalry
also
the
chaplain
who
is
always
kind
and
pleasant
to
me
because
i
kicked
the
lungs
out
of
a
trader
once
it
was
tommy
drake
and
fanny
marsh
that
furnished
the
children
the
nicest
at
the
post
i
think
that
poor
orphan
child
is
on
her
way
from
is
full
of
the
subject
her
father
was
general
brother
married
a
beautiful
young
spanish
lady
ten
years
ago
and
has
never
been
in
america
since
they
lived
in
spain
a
year
or
two
then
went
to
france
both
died
some
months
ago
this
little
girl
that
is
coming
is
the
only
child
general
alison
is
glad
to
have
her
he
has
never
seen
her
he
is
a
very
nice
old
bachelor
but
is
an
old
bachelor
just
the
same
and
more
than
about
a
year
this
side
of
retirement
by
age
limit
and
so
what
does
he
know
about
taking
care
of
a
little
maid
nine
years
old
if
i
could
have
her
it
would
be
another
matter
for
i
know
all
about
children
and
they
adore
me
buffalo
bill
will
tell
you
so
himself
i
have
some
of
this
news
from
the
the
rest
of
it
i
got
from
potter
the
dog
potter
is
the
great
dane
he
is
privileged
all
over
the
post
like
shekels
the
seventh
dog
and
visits
quarters
and
picks
up
everything
that
is
going
in
the
way
of
news
potter
has
no
imagination
and
no
great
deal
of
culture
perhaps
but
he
has
a
historical
mind
and
a
good
memory
and
so
he
is
the
person
i
depend
upon
mainly
to
post
me
up
when
i
get
back
from
a
scout
that
is
if
shekels
is
out
on
depredation
and
i
get
hold
of
him
ii
letter
from
general
alison
dear
let
me
write
again
in
spanish
i
can
not
trust
my
english
and
i
am
aware
from
what
your
brother
used
to
say
that
army
officers
educated
at
the
military
academy
of
the
united
states
are
taught
our
tongue
it
is
as
i
told
you
in
my
other
letter
both
my
poor
sister
and
her
husband
when
they
found
they
could
not
recover
expressed
the
wish
that
you
should
have
their
little
knowing
that
you
would
presently
be
retired
from
the
than
that
she
should
remain
with
me
who
am
broken
in
health
or
go
to
your
mother
in
california
whose
health
is
also
frail
you
do
not
know
the
child
therefore
i
must
tell
you
something
about
her
you
will
not
be
ashamed
of
her
looks
for
she
is
a
copy
in
little
of
her
beautiful
it
is
that
andalusian
beauty
which
is
not
surpassable
even
in
your
country
she
has
her
charm
and
grace
and
good
heart
and
sense
of
justice
and
she
has
her
vivacity
and
cheerfulness
and
pluck
and
spirit
of
enterprise
with
the
affectionate
disposition
and
sincerity
of
both
parents
my
sister
pined
for
her
spanish
home
all
these
years
of
exile
she
was
always
talking
of
spain
to
the
child
and
tending
and
nourishing
the
love
of
spain
in
the
little
heart
as
a
precious
flower
and
she
died
happy
in
the
knowledge
that
the
fruitage
of
her
patriotic
labors
was
as
rich
as
even
she
could
desire
cathy
is
a
sufficiently
good
little
scholar
for
her
nine
years
her
mother
taught
her
spanish
herself
and
kept
it
always
fresh
upon
her
ear
and
her
tongue
by
hardly
ever
speaking
with
her
in
any
other
tongue
her
father
was
her
english
teacher
and
talked
with
her
in
that
language
almost
exclusively
french
has
been
her
everyday
speech
for
more
than
seven
years
among
her
playmates
here
she
has
a
good
working
use
of
and
italian
it
is
true
that
there
is
always
a
faint
foreign
fragrance
about
her
speech
no
matter
what
language
she
is
talking
but
it
is
only
just
noticeable
nothing
more
and
is
rather
a
charm
than
a
mar
i
think
in
the
ordinary
cathy
is
neither
before
nor
behind
the
average
child
of
nine
i
should
say
but
i
can
say
this
for
her
in
love
for
her
friends
and
in
and
she
has
not
many
equals
and
in
my
opinion
no
superiors
and
i
beg
of
you
let
her
have
her
way
with
the
dumb
are
her
worship
it
is
an
inheritance
from
her
mother
she
knows
but
little
of
cruelties
and
them
from
her
sight
if
you
can
she
would
flare
up
at
them
and
make
trouble
in
her
small
but
quite
decided
and
resolute
way
for
she
has
a
character
of
her
own
and
lacks
neither
promptness
nor
initiative
sometimes
her
judgment
is
at
fault
but
i
think
her
intentions
are
always
right
once
when
she
was
a
little
creature
of
three
or
four
years
she
suddenly
brought
her
tiny
foot
down
upon
the
floor
in
an
apparent
outbreak
of
indignation
then
fetched
it
a
backward
wipe
and
stooped
down
to
examine
the
result
her
mother
said
what
is
it
child
what
has
stirred
you
so
the
big
ant
was
trying
to
kill
the
little
so
you
protected
the
little
mamma
because
he
had
no
friend
and
i
let
the
big
one
kill
you
have
killed
them
cathy
was
distressed
and
her
lip
trembled
she
picked
up
the
remains
and
laid
them
upon
her
palm
and
said
little
anty
so
sorry
and
i
mean
to
kill
you
but
there
any
other
way
to
save
you
it
was
such
a
she
is
a
dear
and
sweet
little
lady
and
when
she
goes
it
will
give
me
a
sore
heart
but
she
will
be
happy
with
you
and
if
your
heart
is
old
and
tired
give
it
into
her
keeping
she
will
make
it
young
again
she
will
refresh
it
she
will
make
it
sing
be
good
to
her
for
all
our
sakes
my
exile
will
soon
be
over
now
as
soon
as
i
am
a
little
stronger
i
shall
see
my
spain
again
and
that
will
make
me
young
again
mercedes
iii
general
alison
to
his
mother
i
am
glad
to
know
that
you
are
all
well
in
san
that
grandchild
of
yours
has
been
i
do
not
quite
know
how
many
days
it
is
nobody
can
keep
account
of
days
or
anything
else
where
she
is
mother
she
did
what
the
indians
were
never
able
to
do
she
took
the
it
the
first
day
took
me
too
took
the
colonels
the
captains
the
women
the
children
and
the
dumb
brutes
took
buffalo
bill
and
all
his
scouts
took
the
the
last
man
and
in
hours
the
indian
encampment
was
hers
illustrious
old
and
all
do
i
seem
to
have
lost
my
solemnity
my
gravity
my
poise
my
dignity
you
would
lose
your
own
in
my
circumstances
mother
you
never
saw
such
a
winning
little
devil
she
is
all
energy
and
spirit
and
sunshine
and
interest
in
everybody
and
everything
and
pours
out
her
prodigal
love
upon
every
creature
that
will
take
it
high
or
low
christian
or
pagan
feathered
or
furred
and
none
has
declined
it
to
date
and
none
ever
will
i
think
but
she
has
a
temper
and
sometimes
it
catches
fire
and
flames
up
and
is
likely
to
burn
whatever
is
near
it
but
it
is
soon
over
the
passion
goes
as
quickly
as
it
comes
of
course
she
has
an
indian
name
already
indians
always
rechristen
a
stranger
early
attended
to
her
case
he
gave
her
the
indian
equivalent
for
firebug
or
he
said
quiet
soft
like
summer
night
but
when
she
mad
she
it
good
you
see
the
flare
beautiful
mother
beautiful
as
a
picture
and
there
is
a
touch
of
you
in
her
face
and
of
her
george
and
in
her
unresting
activities
and
her
fearless
ways
and
her
sunbursts
and
cloudbursts
she
is
always
bringing
george
back
to
me
these
impulsive
natures
are
dramatic
george
was
dramatic
so
is
this
so
is
buffalo
bill
when
cathy
first
was
in
the
bill
was
away
carrying
orders
to
major
fuller
at
five
forks
up
in
the
clayton
hills
at
i
was
at
my
desk
trying
to
work
and
this
sprite
had
been
making
it
impossible
for
half
an
hour
at
last
i
said
you
bewitching
little
scamp
you
be
quiet
just
a
minute
or
two
and
let
your
poor
old
uncle
attend
to
a
part
of
his
duties
try
uncle
i
will
indeed
she
said
then
a
good
me
now
then
sit
up
in
that
chair
and
set
your
eye
on
that
clock
right
if
you
you
so
much
as
four
whole
minutes
bite
you
it
was
very
sweet
and
humble
and
obedient
she
looked
sitting
there
still
as
a
mouse
i
could
hardly
keep
from
setting
her
free
and
telling
her
to
make
as
much
racket
as
she
wanted
to
during
as
much
as
two
minutes
there
was
a
most
unnatural
and
heavenly
quiet
and
repose
then
buffalo
bill
came
thundering
up
to
the
door
in
all
his
scout
finery
flung
himself
out
of
the
saddle
said
to
his
horse
for
me
boy
and
stepped
in
and
stopped
dead
in
his
at
the
child
she
forgot
orders
and
was
on
the
floor
in
a
moment
saying
you
are
so
beautiful
do
you
like
me
i
i
love
you
and
he
gathered
her
up
with
a
hug
and
then
set
her
on
his
nine
feet
from
the
floor
she
was
at
home
she
played
with
his
long
hair
and
admired
his
big
hands
and
his
clothes
and
his
carbine
and
asked
question
after
question
as
fast
as
he
could
answer
until
i
excused
them
both
for
half
an
hour
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
finish
my
work
then
i
heard
cathy
exclaiming
over
soldier
boy
and
he
was
worthy
of
her
raptures
for
he
is
a
wonder
of
a
horse
and
has
a
reputation
which
is
as
shining
as
his
own
silken
hide
iv
cathy
to
her
aunt
mercedes
oh
it
is
wonderful
here
aunty
dear
just
paradise
oh
if
you
could
only
see
it
everything
so
wild
and
lovely
such
grand
plains
stretching
such
miles
and
miles
and
miles
all
the
most
delicious
velvety
sand
and
and
rabbits
as
big
as
a
dog
and
such
tall
and
noble
jackassful
ears
that
that
is
what
they
name
them
by
and
such
vast
mountains
and
so
rugged
and
craggy
and
lofty
with
wrapped
around
their
shoulders
and
looking
so
solemn
and
awful
and
satisfied
and
the
charming
indians
oh
how
you
would
dote
on
them
aunty
dear
and
they
would
on
you
too
and
they
would
let
you
hold
their
babies
the
way
they
do
me
and
they
the
fattest
and
brownest
and
sweetest
little
things
and
never
cry
and
if
they
had
pins
sticking
in
them
which
they
because
they
are
poor
and
afford
it
and
the
horses
and
mules
and
cattle
and
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
not
an
animal
that
you
do
what
you
please
with
except
uncle
thomas
but
mind
him
lovely
and
oh
if
you
could
hear
the
bugles
and
so
beautiful
do
you
recognize
that
one
the
first
toots
of
the
it
goes
dear
me
early
in
the
morning
i
and
every
other
soldier
on
the
whole
place
are
up
and
out
in
a
minute
except
uncle
thomas
who
is
most
unaccountably
lazy
i
know
why
but
i
have
talked
to
him
about
it
and
i
reckon
it
will
be
better
now
he
any
faults
much
and
is
charming
and
sweet
like
buffalo
bill
and
and
mammy
dorcas
and
soldier
boy
and
shekels
and
potter
and
that
just
angels
as
you
may
say
the
very
first
day
i
came
i
know
how
long
ago
it
was
buffalo
bill
took
me
on
soldier
boy
to
camp
not
the
big
one
which
is
out
on
the
plain
which
is
white
he
took
me
to
one
next
day
but
this
one
is
four
or
five
miles
up
in
the
hills
and
crags
where
there
is
a
great
meadow
full
of
indian
lodges
and
dogs
and
squaws
and
everything
that
is
interesting
and
a
brook
of
the
clearest
water
running
through
it
with
white
pebbles
on
the
bottom
and
trees
all
along
the
banks
cool
and
shady
and
good
to
wade
in
and
as
the
sun
goes
down
it
is
dimmish
in
there
but
away
up
against
the
sky
you
see
the
big
peaks
towering
up
and
shining
bright
and
vivid
in
the
sun
and
sometimes
an
eagle
sailing
by
them
not
flapping
a
wing
the
same
as
if
he
was
asleep
and
young
indians
and
girls
romping
and
laughing
and
carrying
on
around
the
spring
and
the
pool
and
not
much
clothes
on
except
the
girls
and
dogs
fighting
and
the
squaws
busy
at
work
and
the
bucks
busy
resting
and
the
old
men
sitting
in
a
bunch
smoking
and
passing
the
pipe
not
to
the
left
but
to
the
right
which
means
been
a
row
in
the
camp
and
they
are
settling
it
if
they
can
and
children
playing
the
same
as
any
other
children
and
little
boys
shooting
at
a
mark
with
bows
and
i
cuffed
one
of
them
because
he
hit
a
dog
with
a
club
that
doing
anything
and
he
resented
it
but
before
long
he
wished
he
but
this
sentence
is
getting
too
long
and
i
will
start
another
put
on
his
war
outfit
to
let
me
see
him
and
he
was
splendid
to
look
at
with
his
face
painted
red
and
bright
and
intense
like
a
and
a
valance
of
eagle
feathers
from
the
top
of
his
head
all
down
his
back
and
he
had
his
tomahawk
too
and
his
pipe
which
has
a
stem
which
is
longer
than
my
arm
and
i
never
had
such
a
good
time
in
an
indian
camp
in
my
life
and
i
learned
a
lot
of
words
of
the
language
and
next
day
bb
took
me
to
the
camp
out
on
the
plains
four
miles
and
i
had
another
good
time
and
got
acquainted
with
some
more
indians
and
dogs
and
the
big
chief
by
the
name
of
white
cloud
gave
me
a
pretty
little
bow
and
arrows
and
i
gave
him
my
red
and
in
four
days
i
could
shoot
very
well
with
it
and
beat
any
white
boy
of
my
size
at
the
post
and
i
have
been
to
those
camps
plenty
of
times
since
and
i
have
learned
to
ride
too
bb
taught
me
and
every
day
he
practises
me
and
praises
me
and
every
time
i
do
better
than
ever
he
lets
me
have
a
scamper
on
soldier
boy
and
the
last
agony
of
pleasure
for
he
is
the
charmingest
horse
and
so
beautiful
and
shiny
and
black
and
another
color
on
him
anywhere
except
a
white
star
in
his
forehead
not
just
an
imitation
star
but
a
real
one
with
four
points
shaped
exactly
like
a
star
and
if
you
should
cover
him
all
up
but
his
star
you
would
know
him
anywhere
even
in
jerusalem
or
australia
by
that
and
i
got
acquainted
with
a
good
many
of
the
seventh
cavalry
and
the
dragoons
and
officers
and
families
and
horses
in
the
first
few
days
and
some
more
in
the
next
few
and
the
next
few
and
the
next
few
and
now
i
know
more
soldiers
and
horses
than
you
can
think
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
i
am
keeping
up
my
studies
every
now
and
then
but
there
much
time
for
it
i
love
you
so
and
i
send
you
a
hug
and
a
kiss
cathy
belong
to
the
seventh
cavalry
and
ninth
dragoons
i
am
an
officer
too
and
do
not
have
to
work
on
account
of
not
getting
any
wages
v
general
alison
to
mercedes
she
has
been
with
us
a
good
nice
long
time
now
you
are
troubled
about
your
sprite
because
this
is
such
a
wild
frontier
hundreds
of
miles
from
civilization
and
peopled
only
by
wandering
tribes
of
savages
you
fear
for
her
safety
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
about
her
dear
me
in
a
nursery
and
got
more
than
eighteen
hundred
nurses
it
would
distress
the
garrison
to
suspect
that
you
think
they
take
care
of
her
they
think
they
can
they
would
tell
you
so
themselves
you
see
the
seventh
cavalry
has
never
had
a
child
of
its
very
own
before
and
neither
has
the
ninth
dragoons
and
so
they
are
like
all
new
mothers
they
think
there
is
no
other
child
like
theirs
no
other
child
so
wonderful
none
that
is
so
worthy
to
be
faithfully
and
tenderly
looked
after
and
protected
these
bronzed
veterans
of
mine
are
very
good
mothers
i
think
and
wiser
than
some
other
mothers
for
they
let
her
take
lots
of
risks
and
it
is
a
good
education
for
her
and
the
more
risks
she
takes
and
comes
successfully
out
of
the
prouder
they
are
of
her
they
adopted
her
with
grave
and
formal
military
ceremonies
of
their
own
is
the
truer
word
solemnities
that
were
so
profoundly
solemn
and
earnest
that
the
spectacle
would
have
been
comical
if
it
been
so
touching
it
was
a
good
show
and
as
stately
and
complex
as
and
the
trooping
of
the
colors
and
it
had
its
own
special
music
composed
for
the
occasion
by
the
bandmaster
of
the
seventh
and
the
child
was
as
serious
as
the
most
serious
soldier
of
them
all
and
finally
when
they
throned
her
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
oldest
veteran
and
pronounced
her
and
truly
adopted
and
the
bands
struck
up
and
all
saluted
and
she
saluted
in
return
it
was
better
and
more
moving
than
any
kindred
thing
i
have
seen
on
the
stage
because
stage
things
are
but
this
was
real
and
the
hearts
were
in
it
it
happened
several
weeks
ago
and
was
followed
by
some
additional
solemnities
the
men
created
a
couple
of
new
ranks
thitherto
unknown
to
the
army
regulations
and
conferred
them
upon
cathy
with
ceremonies
suitable
to
a
duke
so
now
she
is
of
the
seventh
cavalry
and
of
the
ninth
dragoons
with
the
privilege
decreed
by
the
men
of
writing
after
her
name
also
they
presented
her
a
pair
of
dark
blue
the
one
with
on
it
the
other
with
also
a
sword
she
wears
them
finally
they
granted
her
the
i
am
witness
that
that
ceremony
is
faithfully
observed
by
both
most
gravely
and
decorously
too
i
have
never
seen
a
soldier
smile
yet
while
delivering
it
nor
cathy
in
returning
it
ostensibly
i
was
not
present
at
these
proceedings
and
am
ignorant
of
them
but
i
was
where
i
could
see
i
was
afraid
of
one
jealousy
of
the
other
children
of
the
post
but
there
is
nothing
of
that
i
am
glad
to
say
on
the
contrary
they
are
proud
of
their
comrade
and
her
honors
it
is
a
surprising
thing
but
it
is
true
the
children
are
devoted
to
cathy
for
she
has
turned
their
dull
frontier
life
into
a
sort
of
continuous
festival
also
they
know
her
for
a
stanch
and
steady
friend
a
friend
who
can
always
be
depended
upon
and
does
not
change
with
the
weather
she
has
become
a
rather
extraordinary
rider
under
the
tutorship
of
a
more
than
extraordinary
which
is
her
pet
name
for
buffalo
bill
she
pronounces
it
he
has
not
only
taught
her
seventeen
ways
of
breaking
her
neck
but
ways
of
avoiding
it
he
has
infused
into
her
the
best
and
surest
protection
of
a
he
did
it
gradually
systematically
little
by
little
a
step
at
a
time
and
each
step
made
sure
before
the
next
was
essayed
and
so
he
inched
her
along
up
through
terrors
that
had
been
discounted
by
training
before
she
reached
them
and
therefore
were
not
recognizable
as
terrors
when
she
got
to
them
well
she
is
a
daring
little
rider
now
and
is
perfect
in
what
she
knows
of
horsemanship
she
will
know
the
art
like
a
west
point
cadet
and
will
exercise
it
as
fearlessly
she
know
anything
about
does
that
distress
you
and
she
is
a
fine
performer
without
any
saddle
at
all
does
that
discomfort
you
do
not
let
it
she
is
not
in
any
danger
i
give
you
my
word
you
said
that
if
my
heart
was
old
and
tired
she
would
refresh
it
and
you
said
truly
i
do
not
know
how
i
got
along
without
her
before
i
was
a
forlorn
old
tree
but
now
that
this
blossoming
vine
has
wound
itself
about
me
and
become
the
life
of
my
life
it
is
very
different
as
a
furnisher
of
business
for
me
and
for
mammy
dorcas
she
is
exhaustlessly
competent
but
i
like
my
share
of
it
and
of
course
dorcas
likes
hers
for
dorcas
george
and
cathy
is
george
over
again
in
so
many
ways
that
she
brings
back
youth
and
the
joys
of
that
time
my
father
tried
to
set
dorcas
free
twenty
years
ago
when
we
still
lived
in
virginia
but
without
success
she
considered
herself
a
member
of
the
family
and
go
and
so
a
member
of
the
family
she
remained
and
has
held
that
position
unchallenged
ever
since
and
holds
it
now
for
when
my
mother
sent
her
here
from
san
bernardino
when
we
learned
that
cathy
was
coming
she
only
changed
from
one
division
of
the
family
to
the
other
she
has
the
warm
heart
of
her
race
and
its
lavish
affections
and
when
cathy
arrived
the
pair
were
mother
and
child
in
five
minutes
and
that
is
what
they
are
to
date
and
will
continue
dorcas
really
thinks
she
raised
george
and
that
is
one
of
her
prides
but
perhaps
it
was
a
mutual
raising
for
their
ages
were
the
years
short
of
mine
but
they
were
playmates
at
any
rate
as
regards
that
there
is
no
room
for
dispute
cathy
thinks
dorcas
is
the
best
catholic
in
america
except
herself
she
could
not
pay
any
one
a
higher
compliment
than
that
and
dorcas
could
not
receive
one
that
would
please
her
better
dorcas
is
satisfied
that
there
has
never
been
a
more
wonderful
child
than
cathy
she
has
conceived
the
curious
idea
that
cathy
is
and
that
one
of
them
is
a
and
failed
to
get
submerged
is
the
idea
to
argue
with
her
that
this
is
nonsense
is
a
waste
of
mind
is
made
up
and
arguments
do
not
affect
it
she
says
at
her
she
loves
dolls
and
and
everything
a
girl
loves
and
gentle
and
sweet
and
cruel
to
dumb
the
but
she
loves
and
drums
and
fifes
and
soldiering
and
and
afraid
of
anybody
or
the
you
tell
only
child
no
sir
twins
and
one
of
them
got
shet
up
out
of
sight
out
of
sight
but
that
make
any
difference
that
boy
is
in
there
and
you
can
see
him
look
out
of
her
eyes
when
her
temper
is
then
dorcas
went
on
in
her
simple
and
earnest
way
to
furnish
illustrations
at
that
raven
marse
tom
would
anybody
befriend
a
raven
but
that
child
of
course
they
it
natural
well
the
injun
boy
had
the
raven
tied
up
and
was
all
the
time
plaguing
it
and
starving
it
and
she
pitied
the
thing
and
tried
to
buy
it
from
the
boy
and
the
tears
was
in
her
eyes
that
was
the
you
see
she
offered
him
her
thimble
and
he
flung
it
down
she
offered
him
all
the
doughnuts
she
had
which
was
two
and
he
flung
them
down
she
offered
him
half
a
paper
of
pins
worth
forty
ravens
and
he
made
a
mouth
at
her
and
jabbed
one
of
them
in
the
back
that
was
the
limit
you
know
it
called
for
the
other
twin
her
eyes
blazed
up
and
she
jumped
for
him
like
a
and
when
she
was
done
with
him
she
was
rags
and
he
anything
but
an
allegory
that
was
most
undoubtedly
the
other
twin
you
see
coming
to
the
front
no
sir
tell
he
in
there
seen
him
with
my
own
plenty
of
times
at
what
is
an
allegory
know
marse
tom
one
of
her
words
she
loves
the
big
ones
you
know
and
i
pick
them
up
from
her
they
sound
good
and
i
help
happened
after
she
had
converted
the
boy
into
an
allegory
she
untied
the
raven
and
confiscated
him
by
force
and
fetched
him
home
and
left
the
doughnuts
and
things
on
the
ground
petted
him
of
course
like
she
does
with
every
creature
in
two
days
she
had
him
so
stuck
after
her
that
know
how
he
follows
her
everywhere
and
sets
on
her
shoulder
often
when
she
rides
her
breakneck
of
which
is
the
to
the
front
you
he
does
what
he
pleases
and
is
up
to
all
kinds
of
devilment
and
is
a
perfect
nuisance
in
the
kitchen
well
they
all
stand
it
but
they
if
it
was
another
here
she
began
to
chuckle
comfortably
and
presently
she
said
you
know
a
nuisance
herself
miss
cathy
is
she
so
busy
and
into
everything
like
that
bird
all
just
as
innocent
you
know
and
she
mean
any
harm
and
is
so
good
and
dear
and
it
her
fault
her
nature
her
interest
is
always
and
always
and
she
keep
quiet
well
yesterday
it
was
miss
cathy
do
and
miss
cathy
let
that
and
miss
cathy
make
so
much
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
i
reckon
i
had
found
fault
fourteen
times
in
fifteen
minutes
then
she
looked
up
at
me
with
her
big
brown
eyes
that
can
plead
so
and
said
in
that
odd
little
foreign
way
that
goes
to
your
heart
mammy
make
me
a
of
course
you
did
it
you
old
fool
tom
i
just
grabbed
her
up
to
my
breast
and
says
you
dear
little
motherless
thing
you
got
a
fault
in
the
world
and
you
can
do
anything
you
want
to
and
tear
the
house
down
and
old
black
mammy
say
a
word
of
course
of
knew
spoil
the
she
brushed
away
her
tears
and
said
with
dignity
the
child
spoil
child
marse
tom
there
spoil
her
the
king
bee
of
this
post
and
everybody
pets
her
and
is
her
slave
and
yet
as
you
know
your
own
self
she
the
least
little
bit
then
she
eased
her
mind
with
this
retort
tom
she
makes
you
do
anything
she
wants
to
and
you
deny
it
so
if
she
could
be
spoilt
been
spoilt
long
ago
because
you
are
the
very
look
at
that
pile
of
cats
in
your
chair
and
you
sitting
on
a
just
as
patient
because
her
picture
at
that
pile
of
cats
in
your
if
dorcas
were
a
soldier
i
could
punish
her
for
such
large
frankness
as
that
i
changed
the
subject
and
made
her
resume
her
illustrations
she
had
scored
against
me
fairly
and
i
going
to
cheapen
her
victory
by
disputing
it
she
proceeded
to
offer
this
incident
in
evidence
on
her
twin
theory
weeks
ago
when
she
got
her
finger
mashed
open
she
turned
pretty
pale
with
the
pain
but
she
never
said
a
word
i
took
her
in
my
lap
and
the
surgeon
sponged
off
the
blood
and
took
a
needle
and
thread
and
began
to
sew
it
up
it
had
to
have
a
lot
of
stitches
and
each
one
made
her
scrunch
a
little
but
she
never
let
go
a
sound
at
last
the
surgeon
was
so
full
of
admiration
that
he
said
you
a
brave
little
thing
and
she
said
just
as
and
simple
as
if
she
was
talking
about
the
weather
anybody
braver
but
the
cid
you
see
it
was
the
that
the
surgeon
was
with
is
the
cid
know
least
only
what
she
says
always
talking
about
him
and
says
he
was
the
bravest
hero
spain
ever
had
or
any
other
country
they
have
it
up
and
down
the
children
do
she
standing
up
for
the
cid
and
they
working
george
washington
for
all
he
is
they
quarrel
only
disputing
and
bragging
the
way
children
do
they
want
her
to
be
an
american
but
she
be
anything
but
a
spaniard
she
says
you
see
her
mother
was
always
longing
for
home
thing
and
thinking
about
it
and
so
the
child
is
just
as
much
a
spaniard
as
if
always
lived
there
she
thinks
she
remembers
how
spain
looked
but
i
reckon
she
because
she
was
only
a
baby
when
they
moved
to
france
she
is
very
proud
to
be
a
does
that
please
you
mercedes
very
well
be
content
your
niece
is
loyal
to
her
allegiance
her
mother
laid
deep
the
foundations
of
her
love
for
spain
and
she
will
go
back
to
you
as
good
a
spaniard
as
you
are
yourself
she
has
made
me
promise
to
take
her
to
you
for
a
long
visit
when
the
war
office
retires
me
i
attend
to
her
studies
myself
has
she
told
you
that
yes
i
am
her
and
she
makes
pretty
good
progress
i
think
everything
considered
everything
holidays
but
the
fact
is
she
was
not
born
for
study
and
it
comes
hard
hard
for
me
too
it
hurts
me
like
a
physical
pain
to
see
that
free
spirit
of
the
air
and
the
sunshine
laboring
and
grieving
over
a
book
and
sometimes
when
i
find
her
gazing
far
away
towards
the
plain
and
the
blue
mountains
with
the
longing
in
her
eyes
i
have
to
throw
open
the
prison
doors
i
help
it
a
quaint
little
scholar
she
is
and
makes
plenty
of
blunders
once
i
put
the
question
does
the
czar
govern
she
rested
her
elbow
on
her
knee
and
her
chin
on
her
hand
and
took
that
problem
under
deep
consideration
presently
she
looked
up
and
answered
with
a
rising
inflection
implying
a
shade
of
uncertainty
dative
case
here
are
a
couple
of
her
expositions
which
were
delivered
with
tranquil
confidence
diminutive
of
chap
is
masculine
is
she
is
not
a
genius
you
see
but
just
a
normal
child
they
all
make
mistakes
of
that
sort
there
is
a
glad
light
in
her
eye
which
is
pretty
to
see
when
she
finds
herself
able
to
answer
a
question
promptly
and
accurately
without
any
hesitation
as
for
instance
this
morning
dear
what
is
a
cube
a
native
of
she
still
drops
a
foreign
word
into
her
talk
now
and
then
and
there
is
still
a
subtle
foreign
flavor
or
fragrance
about
even
her
exactest
long
may
this
abide
for
it
has
for
me
a
charm
that
is
very
pleasant
sometimes
her
english
is
daintily
prim
and
bookish
and
captivating
she
has
a
sweet
tooth
but
for
her
sake
i
try
to
keep
its
inspirations
under
check
she
is
is
proper
for
a
titled
and
recognized
military
personage
which
she
the
chain
presses
sometimes
for
instance
we
were
out
for
a
walk
and
passed
by
some
bushes
that
were
freighted
with
wild
her
face
brightened
and
she
put
her
hands
together
and
delivered
herself
of
this
speech
most
feelingly
if
i
was
permitted
a
vice
it
would
be
the
could
i
resist
that
no
i
gave
her
a
gooseberry
you
ask
about
her
languages
they
take
care
of
themselves
they
will
not
get
rusty
here
our
regiments
are
not
made
up
of
natives
from
it
and
she
is
picking
up
indian
tongues
diligently
vi
soldier
boy
and
the
mexican
plug
did
you
come
at
from
you
in
the
service
trade
i
do
you
know
about
it
saw
you
when
you
came
i
recognized
your
master
he
is
a
bad
sort
know
him
very
well
stole
you
he
it
amounted
to
thought
so
where
is
his
pard
stopped
at
white
is
another
of
the
same
stripe
is
blake
they
are
laying
for
buffalo
bill
again
i
guess
is
your
name
one
you
got
more
than
one
get
a
new
one
every
time
stolen
i
used
to
have
an
honest
name
but
that
was
early
forgotten
it
since
then
had
thirteen
what
is
alias
false
a
fine
large
word
and
is
in
my
line
it
has
quite
a
learned
and
cerebrospinal
incandescent
sound
are
you
educated
no
i
claim
it
i
can
take
down
bars
i
can
distinguish
oats
from
i
can
blaspheme
a
with
the
and
i
know
a
few
other
many
i
have
had
no
chance
i
have
always
had
to
work
besides
i
am
of
low
birth
and
no
family
you
speak
my
dialect
like
a
native
but
you
are
not
a
mexican
plug
you
are
a
gentleman
i
can
see
that
and
educated
of
i
am
of
old
family
and
not
illiterate
i
am
a
which
the
first
horses
were
fossils
they
date
back
two
million
sand
and
do
you
mean
it
it
is
true
the
bones
of
my
ancestors
are
held
in
reverence
and
worship
even
by
men
they
do
not
leave
them
exposed
to
the
weather
when
they
find
them
but
carry
them
three
thousand
miles
and
enshrine
them
in
their
temples
of
learning
and
worship
is
wonderful
i
knew
you
must
be
a
person
of
distinction
by
your
fine
presence
and
courtly
address
and
by
the
fact
that
you
are
not
subjected
to
the
indignity
of
hobbles
like
myself
and
the
rest
would
you
tell
me
your
name
have
probably
heard
of
renowned
the
illustrious
takes
my
breath
little
did
i
dream
that
ever
i
should
stand
face
to
face
with
the
possessor
of
that
great
name
buffalo
horse
known
from
the
canadian
border
to
the
deserts
of
arizona
and
from
the
eastern
marches
of
the
great
plains
to
the
of
the
sierra
truly
this
is
a
memorable
day
you
still
serve
the
celebrated
chief
of
scouts
am
still
his
property
but
he
has
lent
me
for
a
time
to
the
most
noble
the
most
gracious
the
most
excellent
her
excellency
catherine
seventh
cavalry
and
ninth
dragoons
whom
be
peace
did
you
say
excellency
same
a
spanish
lady
sweet
blossom
of
a
ducal
house
and
truly
a
wonder
knowing
everything
capable
of
everything
speaking
all
the
languages
master
of
all
sciences
a
mind
without
horizons
a
heart
of
gold
the
glory
of
her
race
on
whom
be
peace
it
is
marvellous
i
knew
many
things
she
has
taught
me
others
i
am
educated
i
will
tell
you
about
am
will
tell
a
plain
tale
calmly
without
excitement
without
eloquence
when
she
had
been
here
four
or
five
weeks
she
was
already
erudite
in
military
things
and
they
made
her
an
double
officer
she
rode
the
drill
every
day
like
any
soldier
and
she
could
take
the
bugle
and
direct
the
evolutions
herself
then
on
a
day
there
was
a
grand
race
for
to
enter
but
the
children
seventeen
children
entered
and
she
was
the
youngest
three
girls
fourteen
riders
all
it
was
a
steeplechase
with
four
hurdles
all
pretty
high
the
first
prize
was
a
most
cunning
silver
bugle
and
mighty
pretty
with
red
silk
cord
and
tassels
buffalo
bill
was
very
anxious
for
he
had
taught
her
to
ride
and
he
did
most
dearly
want
her
to
win
that
race
for
the
glory
of
it
so
he
wanted
her
to
ride
me
but
she
and
she
reproached
him
and
said
it
was
unfair
and
unright
and
taking
advantage
for
what
horse
in
this
post
or
any
other
could
stand
a
chance
against
me
and
she
was
very
severe
with
him
and
said
ought
to
be
are
proposing
to
me
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
so
he
just
tossed
her
up
in
the
air
about
thirty
feet
and
caught
her
as
she
came
down
and
said
he
was
ashamed
and
put
up
his
handkerchief
and
pretended
to
cry
which
nearly
broke
her
heart
and
she
petted
him
and
begged
him
to
forgive
her
and
said
she
would
do
anything
in
the
world
he
could
ask
but
that
but
he
said
he
ought
to
go
hang
himself
and
he
if
he
could
get
a
rope
it
was
nothing
but
right
he
should
for
he
never
never
could
forgive
himself
and
then
began
to
cry
and
they
both
sobbed
the
way
you
could
hear
him
a
mile
and
she
clinging
around
his
neck
and
pleading
till
at
last
he
was
comforted
a
little
and
gave
his
solemn
promise
he
hang
himself
till
after
the
race
and
do
it
at
all
if
she
won
it
which
made
her
happy
and
she
said
she
would
win
it
or
die
in
the
saddle
so
then
everything
was
pleasant
again
and
both
of
them
content
he
help
playing
jokes
on
her
he
is
so
fond
of
her
and
she
is
so
innocent
and
unsuspecting
and
when
she
finds
it
out
she
cuffs
him
and
is
in
a
fury
but
presently
forgives
him
because
him
and
maybe
the
very
next
day
caught
with
another
joke
you
see
she
learn
any
better
because
she
any
deceit
in
her
and
that
kind
ever
expecting
it
in
another
person
was
a
grand
race
the
whole
post
was
there
and
there
was
such
another
whooping
and
shouting
when
the
seventeen
kids
came
flying
down
the
turf
and
sailing
over
the
beautiful
to
see
down
it
was
kind
of
neck
and
neck
and
race
and
then
what
should
happen
but
a
cow
steps
out
and
puts
her
head
down
to
munch
grass
with
her
broadside
to
the
battalion
and
they
like
the
wind
they
split
apart
to
flank
her
but
she
drove
the
spurs
home
and
soared
over
that
cow
like
a
bird
and
on
she
went
and
cleared
the
last
hurdle
solitary
and
alone
the
army
letting
loose
the
grand
yell
and
she
skipped
from
the
horse
the
same
as
if
he
had
been
standing
still
and
made
her
bow
and
everybody
crowded
around
to
congratulate
and
they
gave
her
the
bugle
and
she
put
it
to
her
lips
and
blew
and
to
see
how
it
would
go
and
bb
was
as
proud
as
you
think
and
he
said
soldier
boy
and
pass
him
back
till
i
ask
for
him
and
i
can
tell
you
he
have
said
that
to
any
other
person
on
this
planet
that
was
two
months
and
more
ago
and
nobody
has
been
on
my
back
since
but
the
seventh
cavalry
and
of
the
ninth
dragoons
whom
be
peace
picture
every
morning
they
go
clattering
down
into
the
plain
i
me
set
to
work
and
organized
the
sixteen
and
called
it
the
first
battalion
rocky
mountain
rangers
and
she
wanted
to
be
bugler
but
they
elected
her
and
bugler
so
she
ranks
her
uncle
the
commandant
who
is
only
a
brigadier
and
she
train
those
little
people
ask
the
indians
ask
the
traders
ask
the
soldiers
tell
you
she
has
been
at
it
from
the
first
day
every
morning
they
go
clattering
down
into
the
plain
and
there
she
sits
on
my
back
with
her
bugle
at
her
mouth
and
sounds
the
orders
and
puts
them
through
the
evolutions
for
an
hour
or
more
and
it
is
too
beautiful
for
anything
to
see
those
ponies
dissolve
from
one
formation
into
another
and
waltz
about
and
break
and
scatter
and
form
again
always
moving
always
graceful
now
trotting
now
galloping
and
so
on
sometimes
near
by
sometimes
in
the
distance
all
just
like
a
state
ball
you
know
and
sometimes
she
hold
herself
any
longer
but
sounds
the
and
turns
me
loose
and
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
if
the
battalion
too
much
of
a
start
we
catch
up
and
go
over
the
breastworks
with
the
front
line
they
are
soldiers
those
little
people
and
healthy
too
not
ailing
any
more
the
way
they
used
to
be
sometimes
because
of
her
drill
got
a
fort
fanny
marsh
tommy
drake
planned
it
out
and
the
seventh
and
dragoons
built
it
tommy
is
the
son
and
is
fifteen
and
the
oldest
in
the
battalion
fanny
marsh
is
and
is
next
thirteen
she
is
daughter
of
captain
marsh
company
b
seventh
cavalry
alison
is
the
youngest
by
considerable
i
think
she
is
about
nine
and
a
half
or
her
military
rig
as
for
business
for
dress
parade
because
the
ladies
made
it
they
say
they
got
it
out
of
the
middle
of
a
it
is
all
red
and
blue
and
white
silks
and
satins
and
velvets
tights
trunks
sword
doublet
with
slashed
sleeves
short
cape
cap
with
just
one
feather
in
it
heard
them
name
these
things
they
got
them
out
of
the
book
dressed
like
a
page
of
old
times
they
say
the
daintiest
outfit
that
ever
will
say
so
when
you
see
it
lovely
in
just
a
dream
in
some
ways
she
is
just
her
age
but
in
others
as
old
as
her
uncle
i
think
she
is
very
learned
she
teaches
her
uncle
his
book
i
have
seen
her
sitting
by
with
the
book
and
reciting
to
him
what
is
in
it
so
that
he
can
learn
to
do
it
himself
saturday
she
hires
little
injuns
to
garrison
her
fort
then
she
lays
siege
to
it
and
makes
military
approaches
by
trenches
in
night
and
finally
at
dawn
she
draws
her
sword
and
sounds
the
assault
and
takes
it
by
storm
it
is
for
practice
and
she
has
invented
a
all
by
herself
out
of
her
own
head
and
a
stirring
one
and
the
prettiest
in
the
service
to
call
never
used
for
anything
else
she
taught
it
to
me
and
told
me
what
it
says
is
and
when
those
thrilling
notes
come
floating
down
the
distance
i
hear
them
without
fail
even
if
i
am
two
miles
away
and
then
you
should
see
my
heels
get
down
to
business
she
has
taught
me
how
to
say
and
to
her
which
is
by
lifting
my
right
hoof
for
her
to
shake
and
also
how
to
say
i
do
that
with
my
left
only
for
practice
because
there
been
any
but
yet
and
i
hope
there
ever
be
it
would
make
me
cry
if
i
ever
had
to
put
up
my
left
foot
in
earnest
she
has
taught
me
how
to
salute
and
i
can
do
it
as
well
as
a
soldier
i
bow
my
head
low
and
lay
my
right
hoof
against
my
cheek
she
taught
me
that
because
i
got
into
disgrace
once
through
ignorance
i
am
privileged
because
i
am
known
to
be
honorable
and
trustworthy
and
because
i
have
a
distinguished
record
in
the
service
so
they
hobble
me
nor
tie
me
to
stakes
or
shut
me
tight
in
stables
but
let
me
wander
around
to
suit
myself
well
trooping
the
colors
is
a
very
solemn
ceremony
and
everybody
must
stand
uncovered
when
the
flag
goes
by
the
commandant
and
all
and
once
i
was
there
and
ignorantly
walked
across
right
in
front
of
the
band
which
was
an
awful
disgrace
ah
the
was
so
ashamed
and
so
distressed
that
i
should
have
done
such
a
thing
before
all
the
world
that
she
keep
the
tears
back
and
then
she
taught
me
the
salute
so
that
if
i
ever
did
any
other
unmilitary
act
through
ignorance
i
could
do
my
salute
and
she
believed
everybody
would
think
it
was
apology
enough
and
would
not
press
the
matter
it
is
very
nice
and
distinguished
no
other
horse
can
do
it
often
the
men
salute
me
and
i
return
it
i
am
privileged
to
be
present
when
the
rocky
mountain
rangers
troop
the
colors
and
i
stand
solemn
like
the
children
and
i
salute
when
the
flag
goes
by
of
course
when
she
goes
to
her
fort
her
sentries
sing
out
out
the
guard
and
then
do
you
catch
that
refreshing
whiff
from
the
and
the
wild
flowers
the
night
is
far
spent
hear
the
bugles
before
long
dorcas
the
black
woman
is
very
good
and
nice
she
takes
care
of
the
and
is
mother
which
makes
her
to
the
that
is
what
shekels
says
at
least
it
is
what
i
think
he
says
though
i
never
can
understand
him
quite
clearly
is
shekels
seventh
cavalry
dog
i
mean
if
he
a
dog
his
father
was
a
coyote
and
his
mother
was
a
it
really
make
a
dog
out
of
him
does
it
a
real
dog
i
should
think
only
a
kind
of
a
general
dog
at
most
i
reckon
though
this
is
a
matter
of
ichthyology
i
suppose
and
if
it
is
it
is
out
of
my
depth
and
so
my
opinion
is
not
valuable
and
i
claim
much
consideration
for
ichthyology
it
is
dogmatics
which
is
still
more
difficult
and
tangled
up
dogmatics
always
is
quite
beyond
me
quite
so
i
am
not
competing
but
on
general
principles
it
is
my
opinion
that
a
colt
out
of
a
coyote
and
a
is
no
square
dog
but
doubtful
that
is
my
hand
and
i
stand
it
is
as
far
as
i
can
go
myself
and
be
fair
and
conscientious
i
have
always
regarded
him
as
a
doubtful
dog
and
so
has
potter
potter
is
the
great
dane
potter
says
he
is
no
dog
and
not
even
i
do
not
go
quite
so
far
as
that
i
myself
poultry
is
one
of
those
things
which
no
person
can
get
to
the
bottom
of
there
is
so
much
of
it
and
such
variety
it
is
just
wings
and
wings
and
wings
till
you
are
weary
turkeys
and
geese
and
bats
and
butterflies
and
angels
and
grasshoppers
and
there
is
really
no
end
to
the
tribe
it
gives
me
the
heaves
just
to
think
of
it
but
this
one
any
wings
has
he
then
in
my
belief
he
is
more
likely
to
be
dog
than
poultry
i
have
not
heard
of
poultry
that
wings
wings
is
the
of
poultry
it
is
what
you
tell
poultry
by
look
at
the
do
you
reckon
he
is
then
he
must
be
he
could
be
a
reptile
anything
that
wings
is
a
told
you
that
told
me
but
i
overheard
did
you
overhear
it
ago
i
was
with
the
philadelphia
institute
expedition
in
the
bad
lands
under
professor
cope
hunting
mastodon
bones
and
i
overheard
him
say
his
own
self
that
any
plantigrade
circumflex
vertebrate
bacterium
that
wings
and
was
uncertain
was
a
reptile
well
then
has
this
dog
any
wings
no
is
he
a
plantigrade
circumflex
vertebrate
bacterium
maybe
so
maybe
not
but
without
ever
having
seen
him
and
judging
only
by
his
illegal
and
spectacular
parentage
i
will
bet
the
odds
of
a
bale
of
hay
to
a
bran
mash
that
he
looks
it
finally
is
he
uncertain
that
is
the
he
uncertain
i
will
leave
it
to
you
if
you
have
ever
heard
of
a
more
uncertainer
dog
than
what
this
one
is
i
never
then
a
reptile
look
here
alias
good
one
too
i
was
going
to
say
you
are
better
educated
than
you
have
been
pretending
to
be
i
like
cultured
society
and
i
shall
cultivate
your
acquaintance
now
as
to
shekels
whenever
you
want
to
know
about
any
private
thing
that
is
going
on
at
this
post
or
in
white
camp
or
he
can
tell
you
and
if
you
make
friends
with
him
be
glad
to
for
he
is
a
born
gossip
and
picks
up
all
the
being
the
whole
seventh
reptile
he
belong
to
anybody
in
particular
and
any
military
duties
so
he
comes
and
goes
as
he
pleases
and
is
popular
with
all
the
house
cats
and
other
authentic
sources
of
private
information
he
understands
all
the
languages
and
talks
them
all
too
with
an
accent
like
gritting
your
teeth
it
is
true
and
with
a
grammar
that
is
no
improvement
on
with
practice
you
get
at
the
meat
of
what
he
says
and
it
serves
hark
the
picture
music
score
for
the
reveille
and
far
but
it
clear
it
sweet
no
music
like
the
bugle
to
stir
the
blood
in
the
still
solemnity
of
the
morning
twilight
with
the
dim
plain
stretching
away
to
nothing
and
the
spectral
mountains
slumbering
against
the
sky
hear
another
note
in
a
and
far
and
clear
like
the
other
one
and
sweeter
still
notice
wait
listen
there
it
goes
it
says
is
picture
soldier
bugle
call
music
score
now
then
watch
me
leave
a
blue
streak
behind
vii
soldier
boy
and
shekels
you
do
as
i
told
you
did
you
look
up
the
mexican
plug
i
made
his
acquaintance
before
night
and
got
his
liked
him
did
you
at
first
he
took
me
for
a
reptile
and
it
troubled
me
because
i
know
whether
it
was
a
compliment
or
not
i
ask
him
because
it
would
look
ignorant
so
i
say
anything
and
soon
liked
him
very
well
indeed
was
it
a
compliment
do
you
think
that
is
what
it
was
they
are
very
rare
the
reptiles
very
few
left
that
so
what
is
a
reptile
is
a
plantigrade
circumflex
vertebrate
bacterium
that
any
wings
and
is
sounds
fine
it
surely
it
fine
you
may
be
thankful
you
are
am
it
seems
wonderfully
grand
and
elegant
for
a
person
that
is
so
humble
as
i
am
but
i
am
thankful
i
am
indeed
and
will
try
to
live
up
to
it
it
is
hard
to
remember
will
you
say
it
again
please
and
say
it
slow
circumflex
vertebrate
bacterium
that
any
wings
and
is
is
beautiful
anybody
must
grant
it
beautiful
and
of
a
noble
sound
i
hope
it
will
not
make
me
proud
and
should
not
like
to
be
that
it
is
much
more
distinguished
and
honorable
to
be
a
reptile
than
a
dog
you
think
soldier
no
comparison
it
is
awfully
aristocratic
often
a
duke
is
called
a
reptile
it
is
set
down
so
in
that
grand
potter
ever
associate
with
me
but
i
reckon
be
glad
to
when
he
finds
out
what
i
can
depend
upon
will
thank
mongrel
for
this
he
is
a
very
good
sort
for
a
mexican
plug
you
think
he
is
is
my
opinion
of
him
and
as
for
his
birth
he
can
not
help
that
we
can
not
all
be
reptiles
we
can
not
all
be
fossils
we
have
to
take
what
comes
and
be
thankful
it
is
no
worse
it
is
the
true
those
others
to
the
subject
please
did
it
turn
out
that
my
suspicions
were
right
perfectly
right
mongrel
has
heard
them
planning
they
are
after
life
for
running
them
out
of
medicine
bow
and
taking
their
stolen
horses
away
from
get
him
yet
for
if
he
keeps
a
sharp
keep
a
sharp
lookout
he
never
does
he
despises
them
and
all
their
kind
his
life
is
always
being
threatened
and
so
it
has
come
to
be
he
know
they
are
here
yes
he
knows
it
he
is
always
the
earliest
to
know
who
comes
and
who
goes
but
he
cares
nothing
for
them
and
their
threats
he
only
laughs
when
people
warn
him
shoot
him
from
behind
a
tree
the
first
he
knows
did
mongrel
tell
you
their
plans
they
have
found
out
that
he
starts
for
fort
clayton
day
after
with
one
of
his
scouts
so
they
will
leave
letting
on
to
go
south
but
they
will
fetch
around
north
all
in
good
i
like
the
look
of
viii
the
bb
and
alison
bb
handsomely
done
the
seventh
beat
it
you
do
certainly
handle
your
rangers
like
an
expert
general
and
where
are
you
bound
miles
on
the
trail
to
fort
am
i
dear
the
idea
of
it
of
honor
for
you
and
rather
have
it
from
you
than
from
the
of
the
armies
of
the
united
states
you
incomparable
little
soldier
i
need
to
take
any
oath
to
that
for
you
to
believe
like
it
it
well
i
should
say
so
now
the
advance
and
away
we
go
ix
soldier
boy
and
shekels
again
this
is
the
way
it
happened
we
did
the
escort
duty
then
we
came
back
and
struck
for
the
plain
and
put
the
rangers
through
a
rousing
for
hours
then
we
sent
them
home
under
fanny
marsh
then
the
and
i
went
off
on
a
gallop
over
the
plains
for
about
three
hours
and
were
lazying
along
home
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
we
met
jimmy
slade
the
and
he
saluted
and
asked
the
if
she
had
heard
the
news
and
she
said
no
and
he
said
bill
has
been
ambushed
and
badly
shot
this
side
of
clayton
and
thorndike
the
scout
too
bill
travel
but
thorndike
could
and
he
brought
the
news
and
sergeant
wilkes
and
six
men
of
company
b
are
gone
two
hours
ago
hotfoot
to
get
bill
and
they
she
shouts
to
i
ask
foolish
questions
it
was
an
awful
pace
for
four
hours
nothing
happened
and
not
a
word
said
except
that
now
and
then
she
said
it
up
boy
keep
it
up
sweetheart
save
him
i
kept
it
up
well
when
the
dark
shut
down
in
the
rugged
hills
that
poor
little
chap
had
been
tearing
around
in
the
saddle
all
day
and
i
noticed
by
the
slack
that
she
was
tired
and
tottery
and
i
got
dreadfully
afraid
but
every
time
i
tried
to
slow
down
and
let
her
go
to
sleep
so
i
could
stop
she
hurried
me
up
again
and
so
sure
enough
at
last
over
she
went
picture
was
nothing
to
do
but
stand
that
was
a
fix
to
be
in
i
for
she
lay
there
and
stir
and
what
was
i
to
do
i
leave
her
to
fetch
help
on
account
of
the
wolves
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
stand
by
it
was
dreadful
i
was
afraid
she
was
killed
poor
little
thing
but
she
she
came
to
and
said
me
soldier
and
those
were
blessed
words
i
kissed
i
am
used
to
that
and
we
like
it
but
she
get
up
and
i
was
worried
she
fondled
my
nose
with
her
hand
and
talked
to
me
and
called
me
endearing
is
her
she
caressed
with
the
same
hand
all
the
time
the
other
arm
was
broken
you
see
but
i
know
it
and
she
mention
it
she
want
to
distress
me
you
know
the
big
gray
wolves
came
and
hung
around
and
you
could
hear
them
snarl
and
snap
at
each
other
but
you
see
anything
of
them
except
their
eyes
which
shone
in
the
dark
like
sparks
and
stars
the
said
i
had
the
rocky
mountain
rangers
here
we
would
make
those
creatures
climb
a
then
she
made
believe
that
the
rangers
were
in
hearing
and
put
up
her
bugle
and
blew
the
and
then
and
then
the
then
she
blew
the
and
said
for
you
you
rebels
the
rangers
ever
retreat
music
frightened
them
away
but
they
were
hungry
and
kept
coming
back
and
of
course
they
got
bolder
and
bolder
which
is
their
way
it
went
on
for
an
hour
then
the
tired
child
went
to
sleep
and
it
was
pitiful
to
hear
her
moan
and
nestle
and
i
do
anything
for
her
all
the
time
i
was
laying
for
the
wolves
they
are
in
my
line
i
have
had
experience
at
last
the
boldest
one
ventured
within
my
lines
and
i
landed
him
among
his
friends
with
some
of
his
skull
still
on
him
and
they
did
the
rest
in
the
next
hour
i
got
a
couple
more
and
they
went
the
way
of
the
first
one
down
the
throats
of
the
detachment
that
satisfied
the
survivors
and
they
went
away
and
left
us
in
peace
any
more
adventures
though
i
kept
awake
all
night
and
was
ready
from
midnight
on
the
child
got
very
restless
and
out
of
her
head
and
moaned
and
said
and
now
and
then
me
and
sometimes
she
was
in
her
fort
and
giving
orders
to
her
garrison
and
once
she
was
in
spain
and
thought
her
mother
was
with
her
people
say
a
horse
cry
but
they
know
because
we
cry
inside
was
an
hour
after
sunup
that
i
heard
the
boys
coming
and
recognized
the
of
pomp
and
c√¶sar
and
jerry
old
mates
of
mine
and

the
work

and
thorndike
had
lolled
both
of
those
toughs
they
got
to
us
and
buffalo
bill
saw
the
child
lying
there
so
white
he
said
god
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
brought
her
to
herself
and
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
and
struggled
to
get
up
but
and
the
soldiers
gathered
her
up
like
the
tenderest
women
and
their
eyes
were
wet
and
they
were
not
ashamed
when
they
saw
her
arm
dangling
and
so
were
buffalo
and
when
they
laid
her
in
his
arms
he
said
darling
how
does
this
come
and
she
said
came
to
save
you
but
i
was
tired
and
keep
awake
and
fell
off
and
hurt
myself
and
get
on

to
save
me
you
dear
little
rat
it
was
too
lovely
of
you
and
soldier
stood
by
me
which
you
know
he
would
and
protected
me
from
the
wolves
and
if
he
got
a
chance
he
kicked
the
life
out
of
some
of
you
know
he
would
the
sergeant
said

out
three
of
them

and
the
bones

rest
of
his
yours
for
a
kiss
he
got
it
along
with
a
passion
of
delight
and
he
said

feeling
better
now
little
you
think
you
could
blow
the
advance
she
put
up
the
bugle
to
do
it
but
he
said
wait
a
minute
first
then
he
and
the
sergeant
set
her
arm
and
put
it
in
splints
she
wincing
but
not
whimpering
then
we
took
up
the
march
for
home
and
the
end
of
the
tale
and
her
horse
she
a
brick
shekels
more
than
a
brick
more
than
a
thousand
a
reptile
a
compliment
out
of
your
heart
shekels
god
bless
you
for
it
x
general
alison
and
dorcas
much
company
for
her
marse
tom
betwixt
you
and
shekels
the
wife
and
the
cid
oh
i
captain
marsh
and
famine
and
pestilence
the
baby
and
and
her
pups
and
sardanapalus
and
her
these
names
she
gives
the
creatures
they
warp
my
potter
sitting
around
in
the
house
and
soldier
boy
at
the
window
the
entire
time
a
wonder
to
me
she
comes
along
as
well
as
she
does
want
her
all
to
yourself
you
stingy
old
thing
tom
you
know
better
too
much
company
and
then
the
idea
of
her
receiving
reports
all
the
time
from
her
officers
and
acting
upon
them
and
giving
orders
the
same
as
if
she
was
well
it
good
for
her
and
the
surgeon
like
it
and
tried
to
persuade
her
not
to
and
and
when
he
her
she
was
that
outraged
and
indignant
and
was
very
severe
on
him
and
accused
him
of
insubordination
and
said
it
become
him
to
give
orders
to
an
officer
of
her
rank
well
he
saw
he
had
excited
her
more
and
done
more
harm
than
all
the
rest
put
together
so
he
was
vexed
at
himself
and
wished
he
had
kept
still
doctors
know
much
and
a
fact
too
much
interested
in
ought
to
rest
more
all
the
time
sending
messages
to
bb
and
to
soldiers
and
injuns
and
whatnot
and
to
the
the
animals
carries
them
potter
but
mostly
come
who
can
find
fault
with
such
pretty
as
that
it
marse
tom
she
does
send
i
doubt
that
part
of
you
doubt
they
get
them
sir
you
sir
animals
talk
to
one
another
i
know
it
perfectly
well
marse
tom
and
i
saying
it
by
a
curious
superstition
a
superstition
marse
tom
look
at
that
at
him
is
he
listening
or
he
you
see
turned
his
head
away
because
he
was
in
the
act
ask
a
christian
look
any
more
ashamed
than
what
he
looks
now
you
see
he
was
going
to
sneak
out
tell
marse
tom
if
animals
talk
i
miss
guess
and
shekels
is
the
worst
he
goes
and
tells
the
animals
everything
that
happens
in
the
quarters
and
if
short
of
facts
he
invents
them
he
any
more
principle
than
a
blue
jay
and
as
for
morals
empty
look
at
him
now
look
at
him
grovel
he
knows
what
i
am
saying
and
he
knows
the
truth
you
see
yourself
that
he
can
feel
shame
the
only
virtue
got
wonderful
how
they
find
out
everything
going
animals
you
really
believe
they
do
dorcas
only
just
believe
it
marse
tom
i
know
it
day
before
yesterday
they
knew
something
was
going
to
happen
they
were
that
excited
and
whispering
around
together
why
anybody
could
see
that
but
my
i
must
get
back
to
her
and
i
got
to
my
errand
is
it
dorcas
two
or
three
things
one
is
the
doctor
salute
when
he
comes
now
marse
tom
it
anything
to
laugh
at
and
then
forgive
me
i
mean
to
got
caught
see
she
want
to
hurt
the
feelings
so
she
say
anything
to
him
about
it
but
she
is
always
polite
herself
and
it
hurts
that
kind
for
people
to
be
rude
to
have
that
doctor
tom
she
him
hanged
then
have
him
boiled
in
she
him
boiled
very
well
very
well
i
only
want
to
please
her
have
him
want
him
skinned
it
would
break
her
heart
this
is
perfectly
unreasonable
what
in
the
nation
she
want
tom
if
you
would
only
be
a
little
patient
and
not
fly
off
the
handle
at
the
least
little
thing
why
she
only
wants
you
to
speak
to
to
him
well
upon
my
word
all
this
unseemly
rage
and
row
about
such
dorcas
i
never
saw
you
carry
on
like
this
before
you
have
alarmed
the
sentry
he
thinks
i
am
being
assassinated
he
thinks
a
mutiny
a
revolt
an
insurrection
tom
you
are
just
putting
on
you
know
it
perfectly
well
i
know
what
makes
you
act
like
you
always
did
even
when
you
was
little
and
you
get
over
it
i
reckon
are
you
over
it
now
marse
tom
well
yes
but
it
would
try
anybody
to
be
doing
the
best
he
could
offering
every
kindness
he
could
think
of
only
to
have
it
rejected
with
contumely
and
oh
well
let
it
go
no
talk
to
the
doctor
is
that
satisfactory
or
are
you
going
to
break
out
again
sir
it
is
and
only
right
to
talk
to
him
too
because
just
as
she
says
trying
to
keep
up
discipline
in
the
rangers
and
this
insubordination
of
his
is
a
bad
example
for
it
so
marse
tom
there
reason
in
it
i
deny
it
so
i
will
speak
to
him
though
at
bottom
i
think
hanging
would
be
more
lasting
what
is
the
rest
of
your
errand
dorcas
course
her
room
is
ranger
headquarters
now
marse
tom
while
sick
well
soldiers
of
the
cavalry
and
the
dragoons
that
are
off
duty
come
and
get
her
sentries
to
let
them
relieve
them
and
serve
in
their
place
only
out
of
affection
sir
and
because
they
know
military
honors
please
her
and
please
the
children
too
for
her
sake
and
they
bring
their
muskets
and
noticed
them
there
but
twig
the
idea
they
are
standing
guard
are
they
sir
and
she
is
afraid
you
will
reprove
them
and
hurt
their
feelings
if
you
see
them
there
so
she
begs
you
mind
coming
in
the
back
me
up
dorcas
let
me
up
and
behave
marse
tom
you
are
not
going
to
faint
you
are
only
used
to
act
just
so
when
you
was
little
it
does
seem
a
long
time
for
you
to
get
grown
the
way
the
child
is
progressing
i
shall
be
out
of
my
job
before
have
the
whole
post
in
her
hands
i
must
make
a
stand
i
must
not
go
down
without
a
struggle
these
dorcas
what
do
you
think
she
will
think
of
next
tom
she
mean
any
you
sure
of
it
marse
feel
sure
she
has
no
ulterior
designs
know
what
that
is
marse
tom
but
i
know
she
well
then
for
the
present
i
am
satisfied
what
else
have
you
come
about
reckon
i
better
tell
you
the
whole
thing
first
marse
tom
then
tell
you
what
she
wants
been
an
emeute
as
she
calls
it
it
was
before
she
got
back
with
bb
the
officer
of
the
day
reported
it
to
her
this
morning
it
happened
at
her
fort
there
was
a
fuss
betwixt
tommy
drake
and
agnes
frisbie
and
he
snatched
her
doll
away
which
is
made
of
white
kid
stuffed
with
sawdust
and
tore
every
rag
of
its
clothes
off
right
before
them
all
and
is
under
arrest
and
the
charge
is
conduct
i
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
plain
case
too
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
serious
matter
well
what
is
her
pleasure
marse
tom
she
has
summoned
a
but
the
doctor
think
she
is
well
enough
to
preside
over
it
and
she
says
there
anybody
competent
but
her
because
a
concerned
and
so
she
says
would
you
preside
over
it
for
her
marse
tom
up
you
any
more
going
to
faint
than
shekels
here
dorcas
go
along
back
and
be
tactful
be
persuasive
fret
her
tell
her
all
right
the
matter
is
in
my
hands
but
it
good
form
to
hurry
so
grave
a
matter
as
this
explain
to
her
that
we
have
to
go
by
precedents
and
that
i
believe
this
one
to
be
new
in
fact
you
can
say
i
know
that
nothing
just
like
it
has
happened
in
our
army
therefore
i
must
be
guided
by
european
precedents
and
must
go
cautiously
and
examine
them
carefully
tell
her
not
to
be
impatient
it
will
take
me
several
days
but
it
will
all
come
out
right
and
i
will
come
over
and
report
progress
as
i
go
along
do
you
get
the
idea
dorcas
know
as
i
do
this
you
see
it
ever
do
for
me
a
brigadier
in
the
regular
army
to
preside
over
that
infant
any
precedent
for
it
you
see
very
well
i
will
go
on
examining
authorities
and
reporting
progress
until
she
is
well
enough
to
get
me
out
of
this
scrape
by
presiding
herself
do
you
get
it
now
yes
sir
i
get
it
and
good
go
and
fix
it
with
her
and
stay
where
you
what
harm
is
he
doing
it
any
harm
but
it
just
vexes
me
to
see
him
act
was
he
doing
you
see
and
him
in
such
a
sweat
he
was
starting
out
to
spread
it
all
over
the
post
i
reckon
you
deny
any
more
that
they
go
and
tell
everything
they
hear
now
that
seen
it
with
own
i
like
to
acknowledge
it
dorcas
but
i
see
how
i
can
consistently
stick
to
my
doubts
in
the
face
of
such
overwhelming
proof
as
this
dog
is
now
got
in
right
mind
at
last
i
wonder
you
can
be
so
stubborn
marse
tom
but
you
always
was
even
when
you
was
little
going
here
tell
her
that
in
view
of
the
delay
it
is
my
judgment
that
she
ought
to
enlarge
the
accused
on
his
sir
tell
her
marse
tom
get
to
soldier
boy
and
he
stands
there
all
the
time
down
in
the
mouth
and
lonesome
and
she
says
will
you
shake
hands
with
him
and
comfort
him
everybody
a
curious
kind
of
lonesomeness
but
all
right
i
xi
several
months
later
antonio
and
thorndike
that
plug
riding
an
asset
of
the
scrap
you
and
buffalo
bill
had
with
the
late
blake
haskins
and
his
pal
a
few
months
back
this
is
not
a
horse
noticed
he
keeps
up
his
lick
it
a
gaudy
morning
you
are
andalusian
and
when
said
oregonian
antonio
put
it
that
way
and
you
have
my
vote
being
a
native
up
there
i
know
you
being
speak
with
authority
for
that
patch
of
paradise
well
i
can
like
the
don
like
sancho
this
is
the
correct
andalusian
dawn
fresh
dewy
fragrant
though
the
spicy
breezes
blow
soft
up
you
old
cow
stumbling
like
that
when
just
been
praising
you
out
on
a
scout
and
live
up
to
the
honor
any
better
than
that
antonio
how
long
have
you
been
out
here
in
the
plains
and
the
rockies
than
thirteen
a
long
time
you
ever
get
homesick
till
such
a
long
preparations
of
the
retiring
have
started
it
course
keeps
me
thinking
about
spain
i
know
the
region
where
the
aunt
lives
i
know
all
the
lovely
country
for
miles
around
bet
seen
her
villa
many
a
time
bet
been
in
it
in
those
pleasant
old
times
when
i
was
a
spanish
say
the
child
is
wild
to
see
so
i
know
it
from
what
i
you
talked
with
her
about
it
avoided
it
i
should
soon
be
as
wild
as
she
is
that
would
not
be
wish
i
was
going
antonio
two
things
give
a
lot
to
see
a
see
one
when
she
strikes
a
seen
lots
of
them
i
wish
i
could
see
know
anything
about
it
except
in
a
foggy
way
antonio
but
i
know
enough
to
know
grand
grandest
in
the
world
no
other
sport
that
begins
with
it
tell
you
what
seen
then
you
can
judge
it
was
my
first
and
as
vivid
to
me
now
as
it
was
when
i
saw
it
it
was
a
sunday
afternoon
and
beautiful
weather
and
my
uncle
the
priest
took
me
as
a
reward
for
being
a
good
boy
and
because
of
my
own
accord
and
without
anybody
asking
me
i
had
bankrupted
my
and
given
the
money
to
a
mission
that
was
civilizing
the
chinese
and
sweetening
their
lives
and
softening
their
hearts
with
the
gentle
teachings
of
our
religion
and
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
what
we
saw
that
day
thorndike
amphitheatre
was
packed
from
the
to
the
highest
thousand
people
in
one
circling
mass
one
slanting
solid
nobles
clergy
ladies
gentlemen
state
officials
generals
admirals
soldiers
sailors
lawyers
thieves
merchants
brokers
cooks
housemaids
doubtful
women
dudes
gamblers
beggars
loafers
tramps
american
ladies
gentlemen
preachers
english
ladies
gentlemen
preachers
german
ditto
french
ditto
and
so
on
and
so
on
all
the
world
represented
spaniards
to
admire
and
praise
foreigners
to
enjoy
and
go
home
and
find
they
were
one
solid
sloping
circling
sweep
of
rippling
and
flashing
color
under
the
downpour
of
the
summer
a
garden
a
gaudy
gorgeous
children
munching
oranges
six
thousand
fans
fluttering
and
glimmering
everybody
happy
everybody
chatting
gayly
with
their
intimates
lovely
smiling
recognition
and
salutation
to
other
lovely
gray
old
ladies
and
gentlemen
dealing
in
the
like
exchanges
with
each
such
a
picture
of
cheery
contentment
and
glad
anticipation
not
a
mean
spirit
nor
a
sordid
soul
nor
a
sad
heart
thorndike
i
wish
i
could
see
it
again
the
martial
note
of
a
bugle
cleaves
the
hum
and
the
ring
clear
it
the
great
gate
is
flung
open
and
the
procession
marches
in
splendidly
costumed
and
glittering
the
marshals
of
the
day
then
the
picadores
on
horseback
then
the
matadores
on
foot
each
surrounded
by
his
quadrille
of
they
march
to
the
box
of
the
city
fathers
and
formally
salute
the
key
is
thrown
the
is
unlocked
another
bugle
gate
flies
open
the
bull
plunges
in
furious
trembling
blinking
in
the
blinding
light
and
stands
there
a
magnificent
creature
centre
of
those
multitudinous
and
admiring
eyes
brave
ready
for
battle
his
attitude
a
challenge
he
sees
his
enemy
horsemen
sitting
motionless
with
long
spears
in
rest
upon
blindfolded
nags
lean
and
starved
fit
only
for
sport
and
sacrifice
then
the
bull
makes
a
rush
with
murder
in
his
eye
but
a
picador
meets
him
with
a
in
the
shoulder
he
flinches
with
the
pain
and
the
picador
skips
out
of
danger
a
burst
of
applause
for
the
picador
hisses
for
the
bull
some
shout
at
the
bull
and
call
him
offensive
names
but
he
is
not
listening
to
them
he
is
there
for
business
he
is
not
minding
the
that
come
fluttering
around
to
confuse
him
he
chases
this
way
he
chases
that
way
and
hither
and
yon
scattering
the
nimble
banderillos
in
every
direction
like
a
spray
and
receiving
their
maddening
darts
in
his
neck
as
they
dodge
and
but
a
lively
spectacle
and
brings
down
the
house
ah
you
should
hear
the
thundering
roar
that
goes
up
when
the
game
is
at
its
wildest
and
brilliant
things
are
done
that
first
bull
that
day
was
great
from
the
moment
the
spirit
of
war
rose
to
in
him
and
he
got
down
to
his
work
he
began
to
do
wonders
he
tore
his
way
through
his
persecutors
flinging
one
of
them
clear
over
the
parapet
he
bowled
a
horse
and
his
rider
down
and
plunged
straight
for
the
next
got
home
with
his
horns
wounding
both
horse
and
man
on
again
here
and
there
and
this
way
and
that
and
one
after
another
he
tore
the
bowels
out
of
two
horses
so
that
they
gushed
to
the
ground
and
ripped
a
third
one
so
badly
that
although
they
rushed
him
to
cover
and
shoved
his
bowels
back
and
stuffed
the
rents
with
tow
and
rode
him
against
the
bull
again
he
make
the
trip
he
tried
to
gallop
under
the
spur
but
soon
reeled
and
tottered
and
fell
all
in
a
heap
for
a
while
that
was
the
most
thrilling
and
glorious
and
inspiring
sight
that
ever
was
seen
the
bull
absolutely
cleared
it
and
stood
there
alone
monarch
of
the
place
the
people
went
mad
for
pride
in
him
and
joy
and
delight
and
you
hear
yourself
think
for
the
roar
and
boom
and
crash
of
it
carries
me
clear
out
of
myself
just
to
hear
you
tell
it
it
must
have
been
perfectly
splendid
if
i
live
see
a
yet
before
i
die
did
they
kill
him
yes
that
is
what
the
bull
is
for
they
tired
him
out
and
got
him
at
last
he
kept
rushing
the
matador
who
always
slipped
smartly
and
gracefully
aside
in
time
waiting
for
a
sure
chance
and
at
last
it
came
the
bull
made
a
deadly
plunge
for
avoided
neatly
and
as
he
sped
by
the
long
sword
glided
silently
into
him
between
left
shoulder
and
and
in
to
the
hilt
he
crumpled
down
antonio
it
the
noblest
sport
that
ever
was
i
would
give
a
year
of
my
life
to
see
it
is
the
bull
always
killed
sometimes
a
bull
is
timid
finding
himself
in
so
strange
a
place
and
he
stands
trembling
or
tries
to
retreat
then
everybody
despises
him
for
his
cowardice
and
wants
him
punished
and
made
ridiculous
so
they
hough
him
from
behind
and
it
is
the
funniest
thing
in
the
world
to
see
him
hobbling
around
on
his
severed
legs
the
whole
vast
house
goes
into
hurricanes
of
laughter
over
it
i
have
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
my
cheeks
to
see
it
when
he
has
furnished
all
the
sport
he
can
he
is
not
any
longer
useful
and
is
it
is
perfectly
grand
antonio
perfectly
beautiful
burning
a
nigger
xii
mongrel
and
the
other
horse
you
have
been
listening
it
strange
no
mongrel
i
know
that
it
you
seen
a
good
many
human
beings
in
my
time
they
are
created
as
they
are
they
can
not
help
it
they
are
only
brutal
because
that
is
their
make
brutes
would
be
brutal
if
it
was
me
man
is
most
strange
and
unaccountable
why
should
he
treat
dumb
animals
that
way
when
they
are
not
doing
any
harm
is
not
always
like
that
mongrel
he
is
kind
enough
when
he
is
not
excited
by
the
a
religious
service
think
so
i
have
heard
so
it
is
held
on
reflective
some
then
we
die
do
we
go
to
heaven
and
dwell
with
man
father
thought
not
he
believed
we
do
not
have
to
go
there
unless
we
deserve
part
ii
in
spain
xiii
general
alison
to
his
mother
it
was
a
prodigious
trip
but
delightful
of
course
through
the
rockies
and
the
black
hills
and
the
mighty
sweep
of
the
great
plains
to
civilization
and
the
missouri
the
railroading
began
and
the
delightfulness
ended
but
no
one
is
the
worse
for
the
journey
certainly
not
cathy
nor
dorcas
nor
soldier
boy
and
as
for
me
i
am
not
complaining
spain
is
all
that
cathy
had
pictured
more
she
says
she
is
in
a
fury
of
delight
the
maddest
little
animal
that
ever
was
and
all
for
joy
she
thinks
she
remembers
spain
but
that
is
not
very
likely
i
suppose
the
and
each
other
it
is
a
rapture
of
love
and
beautiful
to
see
it
is
spanish
that
describes
it
will
this
be
a
short
visit
no
it
will
be
permanent
cathy
has
elected
to
abide
with
spain
and
her
aunt
dorcas
says
she
dorcas
foresaw
that
this
would
happen
and
also
says
that
she
wanted
it
to
happen
and
says
the
own
country
is
the
right
place
for
her
and
that
she
ought
not
to
have
been
sent
to
me
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
her
i
thought
it
insane
to
take
soldier
boy
to
spain
but
it
was
well
that
i
yielded
to
pleadings
if
he
had
been
left
behind
half
of
her
heart
would
have
remained
with
him
and
she
would
not
have
been
contented
as
it
is
everything
has
fallen
out
for
the
best
and
we
are
all
satisfied
and
comfortable
it
may
be
that
dorcas
and
i
will
see
america
again
some
day
but
also
it
is
a
case
of
maybe
not
we
left
the
post
in
the
early
morning
it
was
an
affecting
time
the
women
cried
over
cathy
so
did
even
those
stern
warriors
the
rocky
mountain
rangers
shekels
was
there
and
the
cid
and
sardanapalus
and
potter
and
mongrel
and
famine
and
pestilence
and
cathy
kissed
them
all
and
wept
details
of
the
several
arms
of
the
garrison
were
present
to
represent
the
rest
and
say
and
god
bless
you
for
all
the
soldiery
and
there
was
a
special
squad
from
the
seventh
with
the
oldest
veteran
at
its
head
to
speed
the
child
with
grand
honors
and
impressive
ceremonies
and
the
veteran
had
a
touching
speech
by
heart
and
put
up
his
hand
in
salute
and
tried
to
say
it
but
his
lips
trembled
and
his
voice
broke
but
cathy
bent
down
from
the
saddle
and
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
and
turned
his
defeat
to
victory
and
a
cheer
went
up
the
next
act
closed
the
ceremonies
and
was
a
moving
surprise
it
may
be
that
you
have
discovered
before
this
that
the
rigors
of
military
law
and
custom
melt
insensibly
away
and
disappear
when
a
soldier
or
a
regiment
or
the
garrison
wants
to
do
something
that
will
please
cathy
the
bands
conceived
the
idea
of
stirring
her
soldierly
heart
with
a
farewell
which
would
remain
in
her
memory
always
beautiful
and
unfading
and
bring
back
the
past
and
its
love
for
her
whenever
she
should
think
of
it
so
they
got
their
project
placed
before
general
burnaby
my
successor
who
is
newest
slave
and
in
spite
of
poverty
of
precedents
they
got
his
permission
the
bands
knew
the
favorite
military
airs
by
this
hint
you
know
what
is
coming
but
cathy
she
was
asked
to
sound
the
which
she
did
picture
reveille
music
score
with
the
last
note
the
bands
burst
out
with
a
crash
and
woke
the
mountains
with
the
in
a
way
to
make
a
heart
swell
and
thump
and
his
hair
rise
it
was
enough
to
break
a
person
all
up
to
see
radiant
face
shining
out
through
her
gladness
and
tears
by
request
she
blew
the
picture
the
assembly
music
score
then
the
bands
thundered
in
with
round
the
flag
boys
rally
once
again
next
she
blew
another
call
the
picture
to
the
standard
music
score
and
the
bands
responded
with
we
were
marching
through
straightway
she
sounded
and
saddles
that
thrilling
and
most
expediting
picture
boots
and
saddles
music
score
and
the
bands
could
hardly
hold
in
for
the
final
note
then
they
turned
their
whole
strength
loose
on
tramp
tramp
the
boys
are
marching
and
excitement
rose
to
now
an
impressive
the
bugle
sang
this
time
into
and
god
keep
us
all
for
taps
is
the
nightly
release
from
duty
and
farewell
plaintive
sweet
pathetic
for
the
morning
is
never
sure
for
him
always
it
is
possible
that
he
is
hearing
it
for
the
last
picture
taps
music
score
then
the
bands
turned
their
instruments
towards
cathy
and
burst
in
with
that
rollicking
frenzy
of
a
tune
all
get
blind
drunk
when
johnny
comes
marching
all
get
blind
drunk
when
johnny
comes
marching
home
and
followed
it
instantly
with
that
antidote
for
melancholy
merriest
and
gladdest
of
all
military
music
on
any
side
of
the
that
was
the
end
and
i
wish
you
could
have
been
there
to
see
it
all
hear
it
all
and
feel
it
and
get
yourself
blown
away
with
the
hurricane
huzza
that
swept
the
place
as
a
finish
when
we
rode
away
our
main
body
had
already
been
on
the
road
an
hour
or
speak
of
our
camp
equipage
but
we
move
off
alone
when
cathy
blew
the
the
rangers
cantered
out
in
column
of
fours
and
gave
us
escort
and
were
joined
by
white
cloud
and
in
all
their
gaudy
bravery
and
by
buffalo
bill
and
four
subordinate
scouts
three
miles
away
in
the
plains
the
halted
sat
her
horse
like
a
military
statue
the
bugle
at
her
lips
and
put
the
rangers
through
the
evolutions
for
half
an
hour
and
finally
when
she
blew
the
she
led
it
herself
for
the
last
time
she
said
and
got
a
cheer
and
we
said
all
around
and
faced
eastward
and
rode
away
day
soldier
boy
was
stolen
last
night
cathy
is
almost
beside
herself
and
we
can
not
comfort
her
mercedes
and
i
are
not
much
alarmed
about
the
horse
although
this
part
of
spain
is
in
something
of
a
turmoil
politically
at
present
and
there
is
a
good
deal
of
lawlessness
in
ordinary
times
the
thief
and
the
horse
would
soon
be
captured
we
shall
have
them
before
long
i
think
xiv
soldier
himself
it
is
five
months
or
is
it
six
my
troubles
have
clouded
my
memory
i
have
been
all
over
this
land
from
end
to
end
and
now
i
am
back
again
since
day
before
yesterday
to
that
city
which
we
passed
through
that
last
day
of
our
long
journey
and
which
is
near
her
country
home
i
am
a
tottering
ruin
and
my
eyes
are
dim
but
i
recognized
it
if
she
could
see
me
she
would
know
me
and
sound
my
call
i
wish
i
could
hear
it
once
more
it
would
revive
me
it
would
bring
back
her
face
and
the
mountains
and
the
free
life
and
i
would
i
were
dying
i
would
come
she
would
not
know
looking
as
i
do
but
she
would
know
me
by
my
star
but
she
will
never
see
me
for
they
do
not
let
me
out
of
this
shabby
foul
and
miserable
place
with
most
two
wrecks
like
myself
for
company
how
many
times
have
i
changed
hands
i
think
it
is
twelve
can
not
remember
and
each
time
it
was
down
a
step
lower
and
each
time
i
got
a
harder
master
they
have
been
cruel
every
one
they
have
worked
me
night
and
day
in
degraded
employments
and
beaten
me
they
have
fed
me
ill
and
some
days
not
at
all
and
so
i
am
but
bones
now
with
a
rough
and
frowsy
skin
humped
and
cornered
upon
my
shrunken
skin
which
was
once
so
glossy
that
skin
which
she
loved
to
stroke
with
her
hand
i
was
the
pride
of
the
mountains
and
the
great
plains
now
i
am
a
scarecrow
and
despised
these
piteous
wrecks
that
are
my
comrades
here
say
we
have
reached
the
bottom
of
the
scale
the
final
humiliation
they
say
that
when
a
horse
is
no
longer
worth
the
weeds
and
discarded
rubbish
they
feed
to
him
they
sell
him
to
the
for
a
glass
of
brandy
to
make
sport
for
the
people
and
perish
for
their
pleasure
to
does
not
disturb
me
we
of
the
service
never
care
for
death
but
if
i
could
see
her
once
more
if
i
could
hear
her
bugle
sing
again
and
say
is
i
xv
general
alison
to
drake
the
wife
to
return
now
to
where
i
was
and
tell
you
the
rest
we
shall
never
know
how
she
came
to
be
there
there
is
no
way
to
account
for
it
she
was
always
watching
for
black
and
shiny
and
spirited
hoping
despairing
hoping
again
always
giving
chase
and
sounding
her
call
upon
the
meagrest
chance
of
a
response
and
breaking
her
heart
over
the
disappointment
always
inquiring
always
interested
in
and
horse
accumulations
in
general
how
she
got
there
must
remain
a
mystery
at
the
point
which
i
had
reached
in
a
preceding
paragraph
of
this
account
the
situation
was
as
follows
two
horses
lay
dying
the
bull
had
scattered
his
persecutors
for
the
moment
and
stood
raging
panting
pawing
the
dust
in
clouds
over
his
back
when
the
man
that
had
been
wounded
returned
to
the
ring
on
a
remount
a
poor
blindfolded
wreck
that
yet
had
something
ironically
military
about
his
the
next
moment
the
bull
had
ripped
him
open
and
his
bowls
were
dragging
upon
the
ground
and
the
bull
was
charging
his
swarm
of
pests
again
then
came
pealing
through
the
air
a
that
froze
my
is
i
turned
cathy
was
flying
down
through
the
massed
people
she
cleared
the
parapet
at
a
bound
and
sped
towards
that
riderless
horse
who
staggered
forward
towards
the
remembered
sound
but
his
strength
failed
and
he
fell
at
her
feet
she
lavishing
kisses
upon
him
and
sobbing
the
house
rising
with
one
impulse
and
white
with
horror
before
help
could
reach
her
the
bull
was
back
picture
his
strength
failed
and
he
fell
at
her
feet
she
was
never
conscious
again
in
life
we
bore
her
home
all
mangled
and
drenched
in
blood
and
knelt
by
her
and
listened
to
her
broken
and
wandering
words
and
prayed
for
her
passing
spirit
and
there
was
no
ever
will
be
i
think
but
she
was
happy
for
she
was
far
away
under
another
sky
and
comrading
again
with
her
rangers
and
her
animal
friends
and
the
soldiers
their
names
fell
softly
and
caressingly
from
her
lips
one
by
one
with
pauses
between
she
was
not
in
pain
but
lay
with
closed
eyes
vacantly
murmuring
as
one
who
dreams
sometimes
she
smiled
saying
nothing
sometimes
she
smiled
when
she
uttered
a
as
shekels
or
bb
or
potter
sometimes
she
was
at
her
fort
issuing
commands
sometimes
she
was
careering
over
the
plain
at
the
head
of
her
men
sometimes
she
was
training
her
horse
once
she
said
reprovingly
are
giving
me
the
wrong
foot
give
me
the
you
know
it
is
after
this
she
lay
silent
some
time
the
end
was
near
she
murmured
sleepy
take
cathy
then
me
for
a
little
time
she
lay
so
still
that
we
were
doubtful
if
she
breathed
then
she
put
out
her
hand
and
began
to
feel
gropingly
about
then
said
can
not
find
it
blow
it
was
