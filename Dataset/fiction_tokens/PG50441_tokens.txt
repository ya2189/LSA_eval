the

by
the
century
earth
population
had
reached
seven
billion
mankind
was
in
danger
of
perishing
for
lack
of
elbow
room
unless
prompt
measures
were
taken
roy
walton
had
the
power
to
enforce
those
measures
but
though
his
job
was
in
the
service
of
humanity
he
soon
found
himself
the
most
hated
man
in
the
world
for
it
was
job
to
tell
parents
their
children
were
unfit
to
live
had
to
uproot
people
from
their
homes
and
send
them
to
remote
areas
of
the
world
now
threatened
by
mobs
of
outraged
citizens
denounced
and
blackened
by
the
press
roy
walton
had
to
make
a
decision
resign
his
post
or
use
his
power
to
destroy
his
enemies
become
a
dictator
in
the
hopes
of
saving
humanity
from

own
folly
in
other
words
should
he

master
of

and
death
cast
of
characters
roy
walton
he
had
to
adopt
the
motto
ends
justify
the
fitzmaugham
his
reward
for
devoted
service
was
an
assassin
bullet
fred
walton
his
ambition
was
to
fill
his
brother
shoes
but
he
underestimated
their
size
lee
percy
his
specialty
was
sugarcoating
bitter
pills
prior
with
the
pen
as
his
only
weapon
could
he
save
his
son
lamarre
he
died
for
discovering
the
secret
of
immortality
i
the
offices
of
the
bureau
of
population
equalization
vulgarly
known
as
popeek
were
located
on
the
twentieth
through
floors
of
the
cullen
building
a
monstrosity
typical
of
at
its
overdecorated
worst
roy
walton
popeek
assistant
administrator
had
to
apologize
to
himself
each
morning
as
he
entered
the
hideous
place
since
taking
the
job
he
had
managed
to
redecorate
his
own
office
on
the
floor
immediately
below
director
fitzmaugham
but
that
had
created
only
one
minor
oasis
in
the
esthetically
repugnant
building
it
could
be
helped
though
popeek
was
unpopular
though
necessary
and
like
the
public
hangman
of
some
centuries
earlier
the
bureau
did
not
rate
attractive
quarters
so
walton
had
removed
some
of
the
iridescent
chrome
scalloping
that
trimmed
the
walls
replaced
the
sash
windows
with
opaquers
and
changed
the
massive
ceiling
fixture
to
more
subtle
electroluminescents
but
the
mark
of
the
last
century
was
stamped
irrevocably
on
both
building
and
office
which
was
as
it
should
be
walton
had
finally
realized
it
was
the
last
century
foolishness
that
had
made
popeek
necessary
after
all
his
desk
was
piled
high
with
reports
and
more
kept
arriving
via
pneumochute
every
minute
the
job
of
assistant
administrator
was
a
thankless
one
he
thought
as
much
responsibility
as
director
fitzmaugham
and
half
the
pay
he
lifted
a
report
from
one
stack
smoothed
the
crinkly
paper
carefully
and
read
it
it
was
a
despatch
from
horrocks
the
popeek
agent
currently
on
duty
in
patagonia
it
was
dated
june
six
days
before
and
after
a
long
and
rambling
prologue
in
the
usual
horrocks
manner
it
went
on
to
say
density
remains
low
here
per
square
mile
far
below
optimum
looks
like
a
prime
candidate
for
walton
agreed
he
reached
for
his
voicewrite
and
said
sharply
memo
from
assistant
administrator
walton
re
equalization
of
he
paused
picking
a
at
random
central
belgium
will
the
section
chief
in
charge
of
this
area
please
consider
the
advisability
of
transferring
population
excess
to
fertile
areas
in
patagonia
recommendation
establishment
of
industries
in
latter
region
to
ease
transition
he
shut
his
eyes
dug
his
thumbs
into
them
until
bright
flares
of
light
shot
across
his
eyeballs
and
refused
to
let
himself
be
bothered
by
the
multiple
problems
involved
in
dumping
several
hundred
thousand
belgians
into
patagonia
he
forced
himself
to
cling
to
one
of
director
fitzmaugham
maxims
you
want
to
stay
sane
think
of
these
people
as
pawns
in
a
chess
game
not
as
human
walton
sighed
this
was
the
biggest
chess
problem
in
the
history
of
humanity
and
the
way
it
looked
now
all
the
solutions
led
to
checkmate
in
a
century
or
less
they
could
keep
equalizing
population
only
so
long
shifting
like
loggers
riding
logs
in
a
rushing
river
before
trouble
came
there
was
another
matter
to
be
attended
to
now
he
picked
up
the
voicewrite
again
memo
from
the
assistant
administrator
re
establishment
of
new
policy
on
reports
from
local
agents
hire
a
staff
of
three
clever
girls
to
make
a
pr√©cis
of
each
report
eliminating
irrelevant
data
it
was
a
basic
step
one
that
should
have
been
taken
long
ago
now
with
three
feet
of
reports
stacked
on
his
desk
it
was
mandatory
one
of
the
troubles
with
popeek
was
its
newness
it
had
been
established
so
suddenly
that
most
of
its
procedures
were
still
in
the
formative
stage
he
took
another
report
from
the
heap
this
one
was
the
data
sheet
of
the
zurich
euthanasia
center
and
he
gave
it
a
cursory
scanning
during
the
past
week
eleven
substandard
children
and
substandard
adults
had
been
sent
on
to
happysleep
that
was
the
grimmest
form
of
population
equalization
walton
initialed
the
report
earmarked
it
for
files
and
dumped
it
in
the
pneumochute
the
annunciator
chimed
i
busy
walton
said
immediately
there
a
mr
prior
to
see
you
the
annunciator
calm
voice
said
he
insists
it
an
emergency
tell
mr
prior
i
ca
see
anyone
for
at
least
three
hours
walton
stared
gloomily
at
the
growing
pile
of
paper
on
his
desk
tell
him
he
can
have
ten
minutes
with
me
at
oh
say
walton
heard
an
angry
male
voice
muttering
something
in
the
outer
office
and
then
the
annunciator
said
he
insists
he
must
see
you
immediately
in
reference
to
a
happysleep
commitment
commitments
are
irrevocable
walton
said
heavily
the
last
thing
in
the
world
he
wanted
was
to
see
a
man
whose
child
or
parent
had
just
been
committed
tell
mr
prior
i
ca
see
him
at
all
walton
found
his
fingers
trembling
he
clamped
them
tight
to
the
edge
of
his
desk
to
steady
himself
it
was
all
right
sitting
up
here
in
this
ugly
building
and
initialing
commitment
papers
but
actually
to
one
of
those
people
and
try
to
convince
him
of
the
need
the
door
burst
open
a
tall
man
in
an
open
jacket
came
rushing
through
and
paused
dramatically
just
over
the
threshold
immediately
behind
him
came
three
unsmiling
men
in
the
gray
uniforms
of
security
they
carried
drawn
needlers
are
you
administrator
walton
the
big
man
asked
in
an
astonishingly
deep
rich
voice
i
have
to
see
you
i
lyle
prior
the
three
security
men
caught
up
and
swarmed
all
over
prior
one
of
them
turned
apologetically
to
walton
we
terribly
sorry
about
this
sir
he
just
broke
away
and
ran
we
ca
understand
how
he
got
in
here
but
he
did
ah
yes
so
i
noticed
walton
remarked
drily
see
if
he
planning
to
assassinate
anybody
will
you
administrator
walton
prior
protested
i
a
man
of
peace
how
can
you
accuse
me
of
one
of
the
security
men
hit
him
walton
stiffened
and
resisted
the
urge
to
reprimand
the
man
he
was
only
doing
his
job
after
all
search
him
walton
said
they
gave
prior
an
efficient
he
clean
walton
should
we
take
him
to
security
or
downstairs
to
health
neither
leave
him
here
with
me
are
you
sure
you
get
out
of
here
walton
snapped
as
the
three
security
men
slinked
away
he
added
and
figure
out
some
more
efficient
system
for
protecting
me
some
day
an
assassin
is
going
to
sneak
through
here
and
get
me
not
that
i
give
a
damn
about
myself
you
understand
simply
that
i
indispensable
there
is
another
lunatic
in
the
world
who
take
this
job
now
they
wasted
no
time
in
leaving
walton
waited
until
the
door
closed
and
jammed
down
hard
on
the
lockstud
his
tirade
he
knew
was
wholly
unjustified
if
he
had
remembered
to
lock
his
door
as
regulations
prescribed
prior
would
never
have
broken
in
but
he
could
admit
that
to
the
guards
take
a
seat
mr
prior
i
have
to
thank
you
for
granting
me
this
audience
prior
said
without
a
hint
of
sarcasm
in
his
booming
voice
i
realize
you
a
terribly
busy
man
i
am
another
three
inches
of
paper
had
deposited
itself
on
desk
since
prior
had
entered
you
very
lucky
to
have
hit
the
psychological
moment
for
your
entrance
at
any
other
time
i
have
had
you
brigged
for
a
month
but
just
now
i
in
need
of
a
little
diversion
besides
i
very
much
admire
your
work
mr
prior
thank
you
again
that
humility
startling
in
so
big
and
commanding
a
man
i
had
expected
to
find
i
mean
that
you
that
a
bureaucrat
should
admire
poetry
is
that
what
you
groping
for
prior
reddened
yes
he
admitted
grinning
walton
said
i
have
to
do
when
i
go
home
at
night
i
do
really
read
popeek
reports
hours
a
day
no
more
than
twenty
that
my
rule
i
thought
your
last
book
was
quite
remarkable
the
critics
did
prior
said
diffidently
critics
what
do
they
know
walton
demanded
they
swing
in
cycles
ten
years
ago
it
was
form
and
technique
and
you
got
the
melling
prize
now
it
message
political
content
that
counts
that
not
poetry
mr
prior
and
there
are
still
a
few
of
us
who
recognize
what
poetry
is
take
yeats
for
instance
walton
was
ready
to
launch
into
a
discussion
of
every
poet
from
prior
back
to
surrey
and
wyatt
anything
to
keep
from
the
job
at
hand
anything
to
keep
his
mind
from
popeek
but
prior
interrupted
him
walton
yes
my
son
philip
he
two
weeks
old
now
walton
understood
no
prior
please
do
ask
walton
skin
felt
cold
his
hands
tightly
clenched
were
clammy
he
was
committed
to
happysleep
this
morning
potentially
tubercular
the
boy
perfectly
sound
walton
could
you
walton
rose
he
said
ask
me
to
do
it
i
ca
make
any
exceptions
not
even
for
you
an
intelligent
man
you
understand
our
program
i
voted
for
popeek
i
know
all
about
weeding
the
garden
and
the
euthanasia
plan
but
i
had
expected
you
thought
euthanasia
was
a
fine
thing
for
people
so
did
everyone
else
walton
said
that
how
the
act
was
passed
tenderly
he
said
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
spare
your
son
our
doctors
give
a
baby
every
chance
to
live
was
tubercular
they
cured
me
what
if
they
had
practiced
euthanasia
a
generation
ago
where
would
my
poems
be
now
it
was
an
unanswerable
question
walton
tried
to
ignore
it
tuberculosis
is
an
extremely
rare
disease
mr
prior
we
can
wipe
it
out
completely
if
we
strike
at
those
with
genetic
traits
meaning
you
kill
any
children
i
have
prior
asked
those
who
inherit
your
condition
walton
said
gently
go
home
mr
prior
burn
me
in
effigy
write
a
poem
about
me
but
do
ask
me
to
do
the
impossible
i
ca
catch
any
falling
stars
for
you
prior
rose
he
was
immense
a
hulking
tragic
figure
staring
broodingly
at
walton
for
the
first
time
since
the
poet
abrupt
entry
walton
feared
violence
his
fingers
groped
for
the
needle
gun
he
kept
in
his
upper
left
desk
drawer
but
prior
had
no
violence
in
him
i
leave
you
he
said
somberly
i
sorry
sir
deeply
sorry
for
both
of
us
walton
pressed
the
doorlock
to
let
him
out
then
locked
it
again
and
slipped
heavily
into
his
chair
three
more
reports
slid
out
of
the
chute
and
landed
on
his
desk
he
stared
at
them
as
if
they
were
three
basilisks
in
the
six
weeks
of
popeek
existence
three
thousand
babies
had
been
ticketed
for
happysleep
and
three
thousand
sets
of
degenerate
genes
had
been
wiped
from
the
race
ten
thousand
subnormal
males
had
been
sterilized
eight
thousand
dying
oldsters
had
reached
their
graves
ahead
of
time
it
was
a
program
but
why
transmit
palsy
to
unborn
generations
why
let
an
adult
idiot
litter
the
world
with
subnormal
progeny
why
force
a
man
hopelessly
cancerous
to
linger
on
in
pain
consuming
precious
food
unpleasant
sure
but
the
world
had
voted
for
it
until
lang
and
his
team
succeeded
in
terraforming
venus
or
until
the
outfit
opened
the
stars
to
mankind
something
had
to
be
done
about
earth
overpopulation
there
were
seven
billion
now
and
the
figure
was
still
growing
prior
words
haunted
him
was
tubercular
where
would
my
poems
be
now
the
big
humble
man
was
one
of
the
great
poets
keats
had
been
tubercular
too
good
are
poets
he
asked
himself
savagely
the
reply
came
swiftly
good
is
anything
then
keats
shakespeare
eliot
yeats
donne
pound
matthews
and
prior
how
much
duller
life
would
be
without
them
walton
thought
picturing
his
bookshelf
his
one
bookshelf
in
his
crowded
little
cubicle
of
a
home
sweat
poured
down
his
back
as
he
groped
toward
his
decision
the
step
he
was
considering
would
disqualify
him
from
his
job
if
he
admitted
it
though
he
would
do
that
under
the
equalization
law
it
would
be
a
criminal
act
but
just
one
baby
would
matter
just
one
prior
baby
with
nervous
fingers
he
switched
on
the
annunciator
and
said
if
there
are
any
calls
for
me
take
the
message
i
be
out
of
my
office
for
the
next
ii
he
stepped
out
of
the
office
glancing
around
furtively
the
outer
office
was
busy
half
a
dozen
girls
were
answering
calls
opening
letters
coordinating
activities
walton
slipped
quickly
past
them
into
the
hallway
there
was
a
knot
of
fear
in
his
stomach
as
he
turned
toward
the
lift
tube
six
weeks
of
pressure
six
weeks
of
tension
since
popeek
was
organized
and
old
man
fitzmaugham
had
tapped
him
for
the
post
and
now
a
rebellion
the
sparing
of
a
single
child
was
a
small
rebellion
true
but
he
knew
he
was
striking
as
effectively
at
the
base
of
popeek
this
way
as
if
he
had
brought
about
repeal
of
the
entire
equalization
law
well
just
one
lapse
he
promised
himself
i
spare
prior
child
and
after
that
i
keep
within
the
law
he
jabbed
the
lift
tube
indicator
and
the
tube
rose
in
its
shaft
the
clinic
was
on
the
twentieth
floor
roy
at
the
sound
of
the
quiet
voice
behind
him
walton
jumped
in
surprise
he
steadied
himself
forcing
himself
to
turn
slowly
the
director
stood
there
good
morning
mr
fitzmaugham
the
old
man
was
smiling
serenely
his
unlined
face
warm
and
friendly
his
mop
of
white
hair
bright
and
full
you
look
preoccupied
boy
something
the
matter
walton
shook
his
head
quickly
just
a
little
tired
sir
there
been
a
lot
of
work
lately
as
he
said
it
he
knew
how
foolish
it
sounded
if
anyone
in
popeek
worked
harder
than
he
did
it
was
the
elderly
director
fitzmaugham
had
striven
for
equalization
legislature
for
fifty
years
and
now
at
the
age
of
eighty
he
put
in
a
day
at
the
task
of
saving
mankind
from
itself
the
director
smiled
you
never
did
learn
how
to
budget
your
strength
roy
you
be
a
wreck
before
you
half
my
age
i
glad
you
adopting
my
habit
of
taking
a
coffee
break
in
the
morning
though
mind
if
i
join
you
i
not
taking
a
break
sir
i
have
some
work
to
do
downstairs
oh
ca
you
take
care
of
it
by
phone
no
mr
fitzmaugham
walton
felt
as
though
he
already
been
tried
drawn
and
quartered
it
requires
personal
attention
i
see
the
deep
warm
eyes
bored
into
his
you
ought
to
slow
down
a
little
i
think
yes
sir
as
soon
as
the
work
eases
up
a
little
fitzmaugham
chuckled
in
another
century
or
two
you
mean
i
afraid
you
never
learn
how
to
relax
my
boy
the
lift
tube
arrived
walton
stepped
to
one
side
allowed
the
director
to
enter
and
got
in
himself
fitzmaugham
pushed
there
was
a
coffee
shop
down
there
hesitantly
walton
pushed
covering
the
panel
with
his
arm
so
the
old
man
would
be
unable
to
see
his
destination
as
the
tube
began
to
descend
fitzmaugham
said
did
mr
prior
come
to
see
you
this
morning
yes
walton
said
he
the
poet
is
he
the
one
you
say
is
so
good
that
right
sir
walton
said
tightly
he
came
to
see
me
first
but
i
had
him
referred
down
to
you
what
was
on
his
mind
walton
hesitated
he
he
wanted
his
son
spared
from
happysleep
naturally
i
had
to
turn
him
down
naturally
fitzmaugham
agreed
solemnly
once
we
make
even
one
exception
the
whole
framework
crumbles
of
course
sir
the
lift
tube
halted
and
rocked
on
its
suspension
the
door
slid
back
revealing
a
neat
gleaming
sign
clinic
and
walton
had
forgotten
the
accursed
sign
he
began
to
wish
he
had
avoided
traveling
down
with
the
director
he
felt
that
his
purpose
must
seem
nakedly
obvious
now
the
old
man
eyes
were
twinkling
amusedly
i
guess
you
get
off
here
he
said
i
hope
you
catch
up
with
your
work
soon
roy
you
really
should
take
some
time
off
for
relaxation
each
day
i
try
sir
walton
stepped
out
of
the
tube
and
returned
fitzmaugham
smile
as
the
door
closed
again
bitter
thoughts
assailed
him
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
fine
criminal
you
are
you
given
the
show
away
already
and
damn
that
smooth
paternal
smile
fitzmaugham
knows
he
must
know
walton
wavered
then
abruptly
made
his
decision
he
sucked
in
a
deep
breath
and
walked
briskly
toward
the
big
room
where
the
euthanasia
files
were
kept
the
room
was
large
as
rooms
went
nowadays
thirty
by
twenty
with
deck
upon
deck
of
donnerson
racked
along
one
wall
and
a
bank
of
microfilm
records
along
the
other
in
six
weeks
of
life
popeek
had
piled
up
an
impressive
collection
of
data
while
he
stood
there
the
computer
chattered
lights
flashed
new
facts
poured
into
the
memory
banks
it
probably
went
on
day
and
night
can
i
help
oh
it
you
walton
a
technician
said
popeek
employed
a
small
army
of
technicians
each
one
faceless
and
without
personality
but
always
ready
to
serve
is
there
anything
i
can
do
i
simply
running
a
routine
checkup
mind
if
i
use
the
machine
not
at
all
sir
go
right
ahead
walton
grinned
lightly
and
stepped
forward
the
technician
practically
backed
out
of
his
presence
doubt
i
must
radiate
he
thought
within
the
building
he
wore
a
sort
of
luminous
halo
by
virtue
of
being
director
prot√©g√©
and
outside
in
the
colder
reality
of
the
crowded
metropolis
he
kept
his
identity
and
popeek
rank
quietly
to
himself
frowning
he
tried
to
remember
the
prior
boy
name
ah
philip
was
it
he
punched
out
a
request
for
the
card
on
philip
prior
a
moment
pause
followed
while
the
millions
of
tiny
cryotronic
circuits
raced
with
information
pulses
searching
the
donnerson
tubes
for
philip
prior
record
then
a
brief
squeaking
sound
and
a
card
dropped
out
of
the
slot
philip
hugh
born
may
new
york
general
hospital
new
york
first
son
of
prior
lyle
martin
and
prior
ava
leonard
wgt
at
birth
an
elaborate
description
of
the
boy
in
great
detail
followed
ending
with
blood
type
agglutinating
characteristic
and
codified
walton
skipped
impatiently
through
that
and
came
to
the
notification
typed
in
curt
impersonal
green
capital
letters
at
the
bottom
of
the
card
at
n
y
euth
clinic
june
he
glanced
at
his
watch
the
time
was
the
boy
was
probably
still
somewhere
in
the
clinic
lab
waiting
for
the
figurative
axe
to
descend
walton
had
set
up
the
schedule
himself
the
gas
chamber
delivered
happysleep
each
day
at
and
he
had
about
half
an
hour
to
save
philip
prior
he
peered
covertly
over
his
shoulder
no
one
was
in
sight
he
slipped
the
baby
card
into
his
breast
pocket
that
done
he
typed
out
a
requisition
for
explanation
of
the
code
the
clinic
used
symbols
began
pouring
forth
and
walton
puzzledly
correlated
them
with
the
line
of
gibberish
on
phillip
prior
record
card
finally
he
found
the
one
he
wanted
he
scrapped
the
guide
sheet
he
had
and
typed
out
a
message
to
the
machine
of
card
number
follows
please
alter
in
all
he
proceeded
to
retype
the
child
card
omitting
both
the
fatal
symbol
and
the
notation
recommending
euthanasia
from
the
new
version
the
machine
beeped
an
acknowledgement
walton
smiled
so
far
so
good
then
he
requested
the
boy
file
all
over
again
after
the
customary
pause
a
card
numbered
dropped
out
of
the
slot
he
read
it
the
deletions
had
been
made
as
far
as
the
machine
was
concerned
philip
prior
was
a
normal
healthy
baby
he
glanced
at
his
watch
still
minutes
before
this
morning
haul
of
unfortunates
was
put
away
now
came
the
real
test
could
he
pry
the
baby
away
from
the
doctors
without
attracting
too
much
attention
to
himself
in
the
process
five
doctors
were
bustling
back
and
forth
as
walton
entered
the
main
section
of
the
clinic
there
must
have
been
a
hundred
babies
there
each
in
a
little
pen
of
its
own
and
the
doctors
were
humming
from
one
to
the
next
while
anxious
parents
watched
from
screens
above
the
equalization
law
provided
that
every
child
be
presented
at
its
local
clinic
within
two
weeks
of
birth
for
an
examination
and
a
certificate
perhaps
one
in
ten
thousand
would
be
denied
a
certificate
and
life
hello
walton
what
brings
you
down
here
walton
smiled
affably
just
a
routine
investigation
doctor
i
try
to
keep
in
touch
with
every
department
we
have
you
know
fitzmaugham
was
down
here
to
look
around
a
little
while
ago
really
getting
a
today
mr
walton
umm
yes
walton
did
like
that
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
about
it
he
have
to
rely
on
the
old
man
abiding
faith
in
his
prot√©g√©
to
pull
him
out
of
any
possible
stickiness
that
arose
seen
my
brother
around
he
asked
fred
he
working
in
room
seven
running
analyses
want
me
to
get
him
for
you
mr
walton
no
no
do
bother
him
thanks
i
find
him
later
inwardly
walton
felt
relieved
fred
walton
his
younger
brother
was
a
doctor
in
the
employ
of
popeek
little
love
was
lost
between
the
brothers
and
roy
did
not
care
to
have
fred
know
he
was
down
there
strolling
casually
through
the
clinic
he
peered
at
a
few
plump
squalling
babies
and
said
find
many
sour
ones
today
seven
so
far
they
scheduled
for
the
chamber
three
tuberc
two
blind
one
congenital
syph
that
only
makes
six
walton
said
oh
and
a
spastic
the
doctor
said
biggest
haul
we
had
yet
seven
in
one
morning
have
any
trouble
with
the
parents
what
do
you
think
the
doctor
asked
but
some
of
them
seemed
to
understand
one
of
the
tuberculars
nearly
raised
the
roof
though
walton
shuddered
you
remember
his
name
he
asked
with
feigned
calm
silence
for
a
moment
no
darned
if
i
can
think
of
it
i
can
look
it
up
for
you
if
you
like
do
bother
walton
said
hurriedly
he
moved
on
down
the
winding
corridor
that
led
to
the
execution
chamber
falbrough
the
executioner
was
studying
a
list
of
names
at
his
desk
when
walton
appeared
falbrough
did
look
like
the
sort
of
man
who
would
enjoy
his
work
he
was
short
and
plump
with
a
bald
head
and
glittering
contact
lenses
in
his
weak
blue
eyes
morning
mr
walton
good
morning
doctor
falbrough
you
be
operating
soon
wo
you
eleven
hundred
as
usual
good
there
a
new
regulation
in
effect
from
now
on
walton
said
to
keep
public
opinion
on
our
side
sir
henceforth
until
further
notice
you
to
check
each
baby
that
comes
to
you
against
the
main
file
just
to
make
sure
there
been
no
mistake
got
that
but
how
never
mind
that
falbrough
there
was
quite
a
tragic
at
one
of
the
european
centers
yesterday
we
may
all
hang
for
it
if
news
gets
out
glibly
i
reel
this
stuff
walton
thought
in
amazement
falbrough
looked
grave
i
see
sir
of
course
we
everything
from
now
on
good
begin
with
the
batch
walton
could
bear
to
remain
down
in
the
clinic
any
longer
he
left
via
a
side
exit
and
signaled
for
a
lift
tube
minutes
later
he
was
back
in
his
office
behind
the
security
of
a
towering
stack
of
work
his
pulse
was
racing
his
throat
was
dry
he
remembered
what
fitzmaugham
had
said
we
make
even
one
exception
the
whole
framework
well
the
framework
had
begun
crumbling
then
and
there
was
little
doubt
in
walton
mind
that
fitzmaugham
knew
or
would
soon
know
what
he
had
done
he
would
have
to
cover
his
traces
somehow
the
annunciator
chimed
and
said
falbrough
of
happysleep
calling
you
sir
put
him
on
the
screen
lit
and
falbrough
face
appeared
its
normal
blandness
had
given
way
to
tenseness
what
is
it
doctor
it
a
good
thing
you
issued
that
order
when
you
did
sir
never
guess
what
just
happened
no
guessing
games
falbrough
speak
up
i
well
sir
i
ran
checks
on
the
seven
babies
they
sent
me
this
morning
and
guess
i
mean
well
one
of
them
should
have
been
sent
to
me
no
it
the
truth
sir
a
cute
little
baby
indeed
i
got
his
card
right
here
the
boy
name
is
philip
prior
and
his
is
fine
any
recommendation
for
euthanasia
on
the
card
walton
asked
no
sir
walton
chewed
at
a
ragged
cuticle
for
a
moment
counterfeiting
great
anxiety
falbrough
we
going
to
have
to
keep
this
very
quiet
someone
slipped
up
in
the
examining
room
and
if
word
gets
out
that
there
been
as
much
as
one
mistake
we
have
a
mob
swarming
over
us
in
half
an
hour
yes
sir
falbrough
looked
terribly
grave
what
should
i
do
sir
do
say
a
word
about
this
to
not
even
the
men
in
the
examining
room
fill
out
a
certificate
for
the
boy
find
his
parents
apologize
and
return
him
to
them
and
make
sure
you
keep
checking
for
any
future
cases
of
this
sort
certainly
sir
is
that
all
it
is
walton
said
crisply
and
broke
the
contact
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
stared
bleakly
at
the
far
wall
the
prior
boy
was
safe
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
the
equalization
law
roy
walton
was
now
a
criminal
he
was
every
bit
as
much
a
criminal
as
the
man
who
tried
to
hide
his
dying
father
from
the
investigators
or
the
anxious
parents
who
attempted
to
bribe
an
examining
doctor
he
felt
curiously
dirty
and
now
that
he
had
betrayed
fitzmaugham
and
the
cause
now
that
it
was
done
he
had
little
idea
why
he
had
done
it
why
he
had
jeopardized
the
popeek
program
his
position
his
life
even
for
the
sake
of
one
potentially
tubercular
baby
well
the
thing
was
done
no
not
quite
later
when
things
had
quieted
down
he
would
have
to
finish
the
job
by
transferring
all
the
men
in
the
clinic
to
distant
places
and
by
obliterating
the
computer
memories
of
this
activities
the
annunciator
chimed
again
your
brother
is
on
the
wire
sir
walton
trembled
imperceptibly
as
he
said
put
him
on
somehow
fred
never
called
unless
he
could
say
or
do
something
unpleasant
and
walton
was
very
much
afraid
that
his
brother
meant
no
good
by
this
call
no
good
at
all
iii
roy
walton
watched
his
brother
head
and
shoulders
take
form
out
of
the
swirl
of
colors
on
the
screen
fred
walton
was
more
compact
built
closer
to
the
ground
than
his
rangy
brother
he
was
a
squat
next
to
roy
lean
fred
had
always
threatened
to
get
even
with
his
older
brother
as
soon
as
they
were
the
same
size
but
to
fred
great
dismay
he
had
never
managed
to
catch
up
with
roy
in
height
even
on
the
screen
fred
neck
and
shoulders
gave
an
impression
of
tremendous
solidity
and
force
walton
waited
for
his
brother
image
to
take
shape
and
when
the
time
lag
was
over
he
said
well
fred
what
goes
his
brother
eyes
flickered
sleepily
they
tell
me
you
were
down
here
a
little
while
ago
roy
how
come
i
did
rate
a
visit
i
was
in
your
section
it
was
official
business
anyway
i
have
time
walton
fixed
his
eyes
sharply
on
the
caduceus
emblem
gleaming
on
lapel
and
refused
to
look
anywhere
else
fred
said
slowly
you
had
time
to
tinker
with
our
computer
though
official
business
really
roy
his
brother
tone
was
venomous
i
happened
to
be
using
the
computer
shortly
after
you
this
morning
i
was
curious
unpardonably
so
dear
brother
i
requested
a
transcript
of
your
conversation
with
the
machine
sparks
seemed
to
flow
from
the
screen
walton
sat
back
feeling
numb
he
managed
to
pull
his
sagging
mouth
back
into
a
stiff
hard
line
and
say
that
a
criminal
offense
fred
any
use
i
make
of
a
popeek
computer
outlet
is
confidential
criminal
offence
maybe
so
but
that
makes
two
of
us
then
eh
roy
how
much
do
you
know
you
would
want
me
to
recite
it
over
a
public
communications
system
would
you
your
friend
fitzmaugham
might
be
listening
to
every
word
of
this
and
i
have
too
much
fraternal
feeling
for
that
ole
doc
walton
does
want
to
get
his
bigwig
big
brother
in
trouble
oh
no
thanks
for
small
blessings
roy
said
acidly
you
got
me
this
job
you
can
take
it
away
let
call
it
even
for
now
shall
we
anything
you
like
walton
said
he
was
drenched
in
sweat
though
the
ingenious
executive
filter
in
the
sending
apparatus
of
the
screen
cloaked
that
fact
and
presented
him
as
neat
and
fresh
i
have
some
work
to
do
now
his
voice
was
barely
audible
i
wo
keep
you
any
longer
then
fred
said
the
screen
went
dead
walton
killed
the
contact
at
his
end
got
up
walked
to
the
window
he
nudged
the
opaquer
control
and
the
frosty
white
haze
over
the
glass
cleared
away
revealing
the
fantastic
beehive
of
the
city
outside
he
thought
he
had
risked
everything
to
save
one
baby
one
child
probably
doomed
to
an
early
death
anyway
and
fitzmaugham
knew
the
old
man
could
see
through
walton
with
ease
and
fred
knew
too
his
brother
and
his
fitzmaugham
might
well
choose
to
conceal
roy
defection
this
time
but
would
surely
place
less
trust
in
him
in
the
future
and
as
for
fred
there
was
no
telling
what
fred
might
do
they
had
never
been
particularly
close
as
brothers
they
had
lived
with
their
parents
now
almost
totally
forgotten
until
roy
was
nine
and
fred
seven
their
parents
had
gone
down
off
maracaibo
in
a
jet
crash
roy
and
fred
had
been
sent
to
the
public
cr√®che
after
that
it
had
been
separate
paths
for
the
brothers
for
roy
an
education
in
the
law
a
short
spell
as
senator
fitzmaugham
private
secretary
followed
last
month
by
his
sudden
elevation
to
assistant
administrator
of
the
popeek
bureau
for
fred
medicine
unsuccessful
private
practice
finally
a
job
in
the
happysleep
section
of
popeek
thanks
to
roy
now
he
has
the
upper
hand
for
the
first
walton
thought
hope
he
not
thirsting
for
my
he
was
being
ground
in
a
vise
he
saw
now
the
gulf
between
the
toughness
needed
for
a
popeek
man
and
the
very
real
streak
of
softness
that
was
part
of
his
character
walton
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
never
merited
his
office
his
only
honorable
move
would
be
to
offer
his
resignation
to
fitzmaugham
at
once
he
thought
back
thought
of
the
senator
saying
is
a
job
for
a
man
with
no
heart
popeek
is
the
cruelest
organization
ever
legislated
by
man
you
think
you
can
handle
it
roy
think
so
sir
i
hope
he
remembered
going
on
to
declare
some
fuzzy
phrases
about
the
need
for
equalization
the
immediate
necessity
for
dealing
with
population
problem
cruelty
is
the
price
of
eternal
fitzmaugham
had
said
walton
remembered
the
day
when
the
united
nations
had
finally
agreed
had
turned
the
population
equalization
bureau
loose
on
a
stunned
world
there
had
been
the
sharp
flare
of
flash
guns
the
clatter
of
reporters
feeding
the
story
to
the
world
the
momentary
the
sense
of
the
nobility
of
popeek
and
then
the
six
weeks
of
gathering
hatred
no
one
liked
popeek
no
one
liked
to
put
antiseptic
on
wounds
either
but
it
had
to
be
done
walton
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
he
had
made
a
serious
mistake
by
saving
philip
prior
but
resigning
his
post
was
no
way
to
atone
for
it
he
opaqued
the
window
again
and
returned
to
his
desk
it
was
time
to
go
through
the
mail
the
first
letter
on
the
stack
was
addressed
to
him
by
hand
he
slit
it
open
and
scanned
it
mr
your
men
came
and
took
away
my
mother
to
be
kild
she
did
do
nothing
and
lived
a
good
life
for
seventy
years
and
i
want
you
to
know
i
think
you
people
are
the
biggest
vermin
since
hitler
and
stalin
and
when
youre
old
and
sick
i
hope
your
own
men
come
for
you
and
stick
you
in
the
furnace
where
you
belong
you
stink
and
all
of
you
signed
walton
shrugged
and
opened
the
next
letter
typed
in
a
crisp
voicewrite
script
on
crinkly
watermarked
paper
see
by
the
papers
that
the
latest
euthanasia
figures
are
the
highest
yet
and
that
you
have
successfully
rid
the
world
of
many
of
its
weak
sisters
those
who
are
unable
to
stand
the
gaff
those
who
in
the
words
of
the
immortal
darwin
are
not
fit
to
survive
my
heartiest
congratulations
sir
upon
the
scope
and
ambition
of
your
bold
and
courageous
program
your
bureau
offers
mankind
its
first
real
chance
to
enter
that
promised
land
that
utopia
that
has
been
our
hope
and
prayer
for
so
do
sincerely
hope
though
that
your
bureau
is
devoting
careful
thought
to
the
type
of
citizen
that
should
be
spared
it
seems
obvious
that
the
myriad
spawning
asiatics
should
be
reduced
tremendously
since
their
unchecked
proliferation
has
caused
such
great
hardship
to
humanity
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
europeans
who
refuse
to
obey
the
demands
of
sanity
and
coming
closer
to
home
i
pray
you
reduce
the
numbers
of
jews
catholics
communists
and
other
freethinking
rabble
in
order
to
make
the
new
reborn
world
purer
and
cleaner
and
with
a
sickly
cough
walton
put
the
letter
down
most
of
them
were
just
this
sort
intelligent
rational
bigoted
letters
there
had
been
the
educated
alabamian
disturbed
that
popeek
did
not
plan
to
eliminate
all
forms
of
citizens
there
had
been
the
michigan
minister
anxious
that
no
relativistic
atheists
escape
the
gas
chamber
and
of
course
there
were
the
other
kind
the
barely
literate
letters
from
bereaved
parents
or
relatives
accusing
popeek
of
nameless
crimes
against
humanity
well
it
was
only
to
be
expected
walton
thought
he
scribbled
his
initials
on
both
the
letters
and
dropped
them
into
the
chute
that
led
to
files
where
they
would
be
put
on
microfilm
and
scrupulously
stored
away
fitzmaugham
insisted
that
every
letter
received
be
read
and
so
filed
some
day
soon
walton
thought
population
equalization
would
be
unnecessary
oh
sure
euthanasia
would
stick
it
was
a
sane
and
in
the
long
run
merciful
process
but
this
business
of
uprooting
a
few
thousand
belgians
and
shipping
them
to
the
open
spaces
in
patagonia
would
cease
lang
and
his
experimenters
were
struggling
to
transform
venus
into
a
livable
world
if
it
worked
the
terraforming
engineers
could
go
on
to
convert
mars
the
bigger
moons
of
jupiter
and
saturn
and
perhaps
even
distant
pluto
if
some
form
of
heating
could
be
developed
there
would
be
another
transition
then
earth
multitudes
would
be
shipped
wholesale
to
the
new
worlds
perhaps
there
would
be
riots
none
but
a
few
adventurers
would
go
willingly
but
some
would
go
and
that
would
be
a
partial
solution
and
then
the
stars
the
project
was
top
secret
so
top
secret
that
in
popeek
only
fitzmaugham
knew
what
was
being
done
on
it
but
if
it
came
through
walton
shrugged
and
turned
back
to
his
work
reports
had
to
be
read
filed
expedited
the
thought
of
fred
and
what
fred
knew
bothered
him
if
only
there
were
some
way
to
relive
this
morning
to
let
the
prior
baby
go
to
the
chamber
as
it
deserved
tension
pounded
in
him
he
slipped
a
hand
into
his
desk
fumbled
found
the
green
pellet
he
was
searching
for
and
swallowed
the
benzolurethrin
almost
unthinkingly
the
tranquilizer
was
only
partly
successful
in
relaxing
him
but
he
was
able
to
work
steadily
without
a
break
until
noon
he
was
about
to
dial
for
lunch
when
the
private
screen
he
and
fitzmaugham
used
between
their
offices
glowed
into
life
roy
the
director
face
looked
impossibly
tranquil
sir
i
going
to
have
a
visitor
at
ludwig
he
wants
to
know
how
things
are
going
walton
nodded
ludwig
was
the
head
american
delegate
to
the
united
nations
a
stubborn
dedicated
man
who
had
fought
popeek
for
years
then
he
had
seen
the
light
and
had
fought
just
as
strenuously
for
its
adoption
do
you
want
me
to
prepare
a
report
for
him
walton
asked
no
roy
i
want
you
to
be
here
i
do
want
to
face
him
alone
sir
some
of
the
un
people
feel
i
running
popeek
as
a
show
fitzmaugham
explained
of
course
that
not
so
as
that
mountain
of
work
on
your
desk
testifies
but
i
want
you
there
as
evidence
of
the
truth
i
want
him
to
see
how
much
i
have
to
rely
on
my
assistants
i
get
it
very
good
mr
fitzmaugham
and
another
thing
the
director
went
on
it
help
appearances
if
i
show
myself
surrounded
with
loyal
young
lieutenants
of
impeccable
character
like
you
roy
thank
you
sir
walton
said
weakly
thank
see
you
at
sharp
then
of
course
sir
the
screen
went
dead
walton
stared
at
it
blankly
he
wondered
if
this
were
some
elaborate
charade
of
the
old
man
fitzmaugham
was
devious
enough
that
last
remark
about
loyal
young
lieutenants
of
impeccable
character
it
had
seemed
to
be
in
good
faith
but
was
it
was
fitzmaugham
staging
an
intricate
pretense
before
deposing
his
faithless
prot√©g√©
maybe
fred
had
something
to
do
with
it
walton
thought
he
decided
to
have
another
session
with
the
computer
after
his
conference
with
fitzmaugham
and
ludwig
perhaps
it
still
was
too
late
to
erase
the
damning
data
and
cover
his
mistake
then
it
would
be
just
his
word
against
fred
he
might
yet
be
able
to
brazen
through
he
thought
dully
he
ordered
lunch
with
quivering
fingers
and
munched
drearily
on
the
tasteless
synthetics
for
awhile
before
dumping
them
down
the
disposal
chute
iv
at
precisely
walton
tidied
his
desk
rose
and
for
the
second
time
that
day
left
his
office
he
was
apprehensive
but
not
unduly
so
behind
his
immediate
surface
fears
and
tensions
lay
a
calm
certainty
that
fitzmaugham
ultimately
would
stick
by
him
and
there
was
little
to
fear
from
fred
he
realized
now
it
was
next
to
impossible
for
a
mere
medic
to
gain
the
ear
of
the
director
himself
in
the
normal
course
of
events
if
fred
attempted
to
contact
fitzmaugham
he
would
automatically
be
referred
to
roy
no
the
danger
in
fred
knowledge
was
potential
not
actual
and
there
might
still
be
time
to
come
to
terms
with
him
it
was
almost
with
a
jaunty
step
that
walton
left
his
office
made
his
way
through
the
busy
outer
office
and
emerged
in
the
outside
corridor
fred
was
waiting
there
he
was
wearing
his
white
medic
smock
stained
yellow
and
red
by
reagents
and
coagulants
he
was
lounging
against
the
curving
plastine
corridor
wall
hands
jammed
deep
into
his
pockets
his
broad
face
wore
an
expression
of
elaborate
casualness
hello
roy
fancy
finding
here
how
did
you
know
i
be
coming
this
way
i
called
your
office
they
told
me
you
were
on
your
way
to
the
lift
tubes
why
so
jumpy
brother
have
a
tough
morning
i
had
worse
walton
said
he
was
tense
guarded
he
pushed
the
stud
beckoning
the
lift
tube
where
you
off
to
fred
asked
confidential
powwow
with
fitz
if
you
have
to
know
fred
eyes
narrowed
strictly
are
you
do
you
have
a
minute
to
talk
to
a
mere
mortal
fred
do
make
unnecessary
trouble
you
know
i
only
got
a
minute
or
two
left
of
my
lunch
hour
i
want
to
make
myself
perfectly
plain
with
you
are
there
any
spy
pickups
in
this
corridor
walton
considered
that
there
were
none
that
he
knew
of
and
he
knew
of
most
still
fitzmaugham
might
have
found
it
advisable
to
plant
a
few
without
advertising
the
fact
i
not
sure
he
said
what
on
your
mind
fred
took
a
pad
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
scrawl
a
note
aloud
he
said
i
take
my
chances
and
tell
you
about
it
anyway
one
of
the
men
in
the
lab
said
another
man
told
him
you
and
fitzmaugham
are
both
secretly
herschelites
his
brow
furrowed
with
the
effort
of
saying
one
thing
and
writing
another
simultaneously
naturally
i
wo
give
you
any
names
yet
but
i
want
you
to
know
i
investigating
his
background
very
carefully
he
may
just
have
been
shooting
his
mouth
off
is
that
why
you
did
want
this
to
go
into
a
spy
pickup
walton
asked
exactly
i
prefer
to
investigate
unofficially
for
the
time
being
fred
finished
the
note
ripped
the
sheet
from
the
pad
and
handed
it
to
his
brother
walton
read
it
wordlessly
the
handwriting
was
jagged
and
untidy
for
it
was
no
easy
feat
to
carry
on
a
conversation
for
the
benefit
of
any
concealed
pickups
while
writing
a
message
it
said
know
all
about
the
prior
baby
i
keep
my
mouth
shut
for
now
so
do
worry
but
do
try
anything
foolish
because
deposited
an
account
of
the
whole
thing
where
you
ca
find
walton
crumpled
the
note
and
tucked
it
into
his
pocket
he
said
thanks
for
the
information
fred
i
keep
it
in
mind
okay
pal
the
lift
tube
arrived
walton
stepped
inside
and
pressed
in
the
moment
it
took
for
the
tube
to
rise
the
one
floor
he
thought
fred
playing
a
waiting
game
he
hold
the
information
over
my
head
until
he
can
make
good
use
of
that
was
some
relief
anyway
no
matter
what
evidence
fred
had
already
salted
away
walton
still
had
a
chance
to
blot
out
some
of
the
computer
memory
track
and
obscure
the
trail
to
that
extent
the
lift
tube
opened
a
gleaming
sign
listed
the
various
activities
of
the
floor
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
it
said
fitzmaugham
fitzmaugham
office
was
at
the
back
of
a
maze
of
small
cubicles
housing
popeek
functionaries
of
one
sort
or
another
walton
had
made
some
attempt
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
organizational
stratification
of
popeek
but
his
success
thus
far
had
been
minimal
fitzmaugham
had
conceived
the
plan
half
a
century
ago
and
had
lovingly
created
and
worked
over
the
organization
structure
through
all
the
long
years
it
took
before
the
law
was
finally
passed
there
were
plenty
of
bugs
in
the
system
but
in
general
blueprint
had
been
sound
sound
enough
for
popeek
to
begin
functioning
almost
immediately
after
its
un
approval
the
manifold
departments
the
tight
network
of
agencies
the
fantastically
detailed
budget
with
its
niggling
appropriations
for
office
supplies
and
its
massive
expenditures
for
say
the
terraforming
project
most
of
these
were
fully
understood
only
by
fitzmaugham
himself
walton
glanced
at
his
watch
he
was
three
minutes
late
the
conversation
with
his
brother
had
delayed
him
but
ludwig
of
the
un
was
not
known
to
be
a
scrupulously
punctual
man
and
there
was
a
high
probability
he
had
arrived
the
secretary
in
the
office
guarding
fitzmaugham
looked
up
as
walton
approached
the
director
is
in
urgent
conference
sir
and
oh
sorry
walton
go
right
in
fitzmaugham
is
expecting
you
is
ludwig
here
yet
yes
sir
he
arrived
about
ten
minutes
ago
curious
walton
thought
from
what
he
knew
of
ludwig
he
was
the
man
to
arrive
early
for
an
appointment
walton
and
fitzmaugham
had
had
plenty
of
dealings
with
him
in
the
days
before
popeek
was
approved
and
never
once
had
ludwig
been
on
time
walton
shrugged
if
ludwig
could
switch
his
stand
so
decisively
from
an
emphatic
to
an
even
more
emphatic
perhaps
he
could
change
in
other
respects
as
well
walton
stepped
within
the
field
of
the
screener
his
image
he
knew
was
being
relayed
inside
where
fitzmaugham
could
scrutinize
him
carefully
before
admitting
him
the
director
was
very
touchy
about
admitting
people
to
his
office
five
seconds
passed
it
usually
took
no
more
than
that
for
fitzmaugham
to
admit
him
but
there
was
no
sign
from
within
and
walton
coughed
discreetly
still
no
answer
he
turned
away
and
walked
over
to
the
desk
where
the
secretary
sat
dictating
into
a
voicewrite
he
waited
for
her
to
finish
her
sentence
then
touched
her
arm
lightly
yes
mr
walton
the
screen
transmission
seems
to
be
out
of
order
would
you
mind
calling
fitzmaugham
on
the
annunciator
and
telling
him
i
here
of
course
sir
her
fingers
deftly
flipped
the
switches
he
waited
for
her
to
announce
him
but
she
paused
and
looked
back
at
walton
he
does
acknowledge
walton
he
must
be
awfully
busy
he
to
acknowledge
ring
him
again
i
sorry
sir
but
him
she
rang
reluctantly
without
any
response
fitzmaugham
preferred
the
sort
of
annunciator
that
had
to
be
acknowledged
walton
allowed
the
girl
to
break
in
on
his
privacy
without
the
formality
of
a
return
buzz
still
no
answer
sir
walton
was
growing
impatient
okay
devil
take
the
acknowledgment
break
in
on
him
and
tell
him
i
waiting
out
here
my
presence
is
important
inside
sir
fitzmaugham
absolutely
forbids
anyone
to
use
the
annunciator
without
his
acknowledgment
the
girl
protested
he
felt
his
neck
going
red
i
take
the
responsibility
i
sorry
sir
all
right
get
away
from
that
machine
and
let
talk
to
him
if
there
are
repercussions
tell
him
i
forced
you
at
gunpoint
she
backed
away
horrified
and
he
slid
in
behind
the
desk
he
made
contact
there
was
no
acknowledgment
he
said
fitzmaugham
this
is
roy
i
outside
your
office
now
should
i
come
in
or
not
silence
he
stared
thoughtfully
at
the
apparatus
i
going
in
there
he
said
the
door
was
of
imitation
wood
a
couple
of
inches
thick
and
probably
filled
with
a
good
sturdy
sheet
of
beryllium
steel
fitzmaugham
liked
protection
walton
contemplated
the
door
for
a
moment
stepping
into
the
screener
field
he
said
fitzmaugham
can
you
hear
me
in
the
ensuing
silence
he
went
on
this
is
walton
i
outside
with
a
blaster
and
unless
i
get
any
orders
to
the
contrary
i
going
to
break
into
your
office
silence
this
was
very
extraordinary
indeed
he
wondered
if
it
were
part
of
some
trap
of
fitzmaugham
well
he
find
out
soon
enough
he
adjusted
the
blaster
aperture
to
and
turned
it
on
a
soft
even
flow
of
heat
bathed
the
door
quite
a
crowd
of
curious
onlookers
had
gathered
by
now
at
a
respectful
distance
walton
maintained
the
steady
heat
the
synthetic
wood
was
sloughing
away
in
dribbly
blue
masses
as
the
radiation
broke
it
down
the
sheet
of
metal
in
the
heart
of
the
door
was
gleaming
bright
red
the
lock
became
visible
now
walton
concentrated
the
flame
there
and
the
door
creaked
and
groaned
he
snapped
the
blaster
off
pocketed
it
and
kicked
the
door
soundly
it
swung
open
he
had
a
momentary
glimpse
of
a
white
head
slumped
over
a
broad
desk
and
then
someone
hit
him
amidships
he
was
a
man
about
his
own
height
wearing
a
blue
suit
woven
through
with
glittering
gold
threads
walton
mind
caught
the
details
with
odd
clarity
the
man
face
was
distorted
with
fear
and
shock
but
walton
recognized
it
clearly
enough
the
ruddy
cheeks
the
broad
nose
and
bushy
eyebrows
belonged
to
ludwig
the
un
man
the
man
who
had
just
assassinated
director
fitzmaugham
he
was
battering
his
fists
into
walton
struggling
to
get
past
him
and
through
the
wrecked
door
to
escape
somewhere
anywhere
walton
grunted
as
a
fist
crashed
into
his
stomach
he
reeled
backward
gagging
and
gasping
but
managed
to
keep
his
hand
on
the
other
coat
desperately
he
pulled
ludwig
to
him
in
the
suddenness
of
the
encounter
he
had
no
time
to
evaluate
what
had
happened
no
time
to
react
to
murder
his
one
thought
was
that
ludwig
had
to
be
subdued
his
fist
cracked
into
the
other
mouth
sharp
pain
shot
up
through
his
hand
at
the
impact
of
knuckles
against
teeth
ludwig
sagged
walton
realized
that
he
was
blocking
the
doorway
not
only
was
he
preventing
ludwig
from
escaping
he
was
also
making
it
impossible
for
anyone
outside
to
come
to
his
own
aid
blindly
he
clubbed
his
fist
down
on
ludwig
neck
spun
him
around
crashed
another
blow
into
the
man
midsection
suddenly
ludwig
pulled
away
from
him
and
ran
back
behind
the
director
desk
walton
followed
him
and
stopped
short
as
he
saw
the
un
man
pause
quiver
tremulously
and
topple
to
the
floor
he
sprawled
grotesquely
on
the
deep
beige
carpet
shook
for
a
moment
then
was
still
walton
gasped
for
breath
his
clothes
were
torn
he
was
sticky
with
sweat
and
blood
his
heart
was
pounding
from
unaccustomed
exertion
killed
the
he
thought
leadenly
now
he
leaned
against
the
doorpost
he
was
conscious
of
figures
moving
past
him
going
into
the
room
examining
fitzmaugham
and
the
figure
on
the
floor
are
you
all
right
a
crisp
familiar
voice
asked
pretty
winded
walton
admitted
have
some
water
walton
accepted
the
drink
gulped
it
looked
up
at
the
man
who
had
spoken
ludwig
how
in
hell
name
a
double
the
un
man
said
come
over
here
and
look
at
him
ludwig
led
him
to
the
on
the
floor
it
was
an
incredible
resemblance
two
or
three
of
the
office
workers
had
rolled
the
body
over
the
jaws
were
clenched
stiffly
the
face
frozen
in
an
agonized
mask
he
took
poison
ludwig
said
i
do
imagine
he
expected
to
get
out
of
here
alive
but
he
did
his
work
well
god
i
wish
i
been
on
time
for
once
in
my
life
walton
glanced
numbly
from
the
dead
ludwig
on
the
floor
to
the
live
one
standing
opposite
him
his
shocked
mind
realized
dimly
what
had
happened
the
assassin
masked
to
look
like
ludwig
had
arrived
at
and
had
been
admitted
to
the
director
office
he
had
killed
the
old
man
and
then
had
remained
inside
the
office
either
hoping
to
make
an
escape
later
in
the
day
or
perhaps
simply
waiting
for
the
poison
to
take
effect
it
was
bound
to
happen
ludwig
said
they
been
gunning
for
the
senator
for
years
and
now
that
popeek
was
passed
walton
looked
involuntarily
at
the
desk
mirror
bright
and
uncluttered
as
always
director
fitzmaugham
was
sprawled
forward
hands
arms
spread
his
impressive
mane
of
white
hair
was
stained
with
his
own
blood
he
had
been
clubbed
the
simplest
crudest
sort
of
murder
emotional
reaction
began
walton
wanted
to
break
things
to
cry
to
let
off
steam
somehow
but
there
were
too
many
people
present
the
office
once
sacrosanct
had
miraculously
become
full
of
popeek
workers
policemen
secretaries
possibly
some
telefax
reporters
walton
recovered
a
shred
of
his
authority
all
of
you
he
said
loudly
he
recognized
sellors
the
building
security
chief
and
added
except
you
sellors
you
can
stay
here
the
crowd
melted
away
magically
now
there
were
just
five
in
the
office
sellors
ludwig
walton
and
the
two
corpses
ludwig
said
do
you
have
any
idea
who
might
be
behind
this
mr
walton
i
do
know
he
said
wearily
there
are
thousands
who
have
wanted
to
kill
the
director
maybe
it
was
a
herschelite
plot
there
be
a
full
investigation
mind
stepping
out
of
the
way
sir
sellors
asked
i
like
to
take
some
photos
walton
and
ludwig
moved
to
one
side
as
the
security
man
went
to
work
it
was
inevitable
walton
thought
that
this
would
happen
fitzmaugham
had
been
the
living
symbol
of
popeek
he
walked
to
the
battered
door
reflecting
that
he
would
have
it
repaired
at
once
that
thought
led
naturally
to
a
new
one
but
before
it
was
fully
formed
in
his
own
mind
ludwig
voiced
it
this
is
a
terrible
tragedy
the
un
man
said
but
one
mitigating
factor
exists
i
sure
fitzmaugham
successor
will
be
a
fitting
one
i
confident
you
be
able
to
carry
on
fitzmaugham
great
work
quite
capably
mr
walton
v
the
new
sign
on
the
office
door
said
of
population
he
had
argued
against
putting
it
up
there
on
the
grounds
that
his
appointment
was
strictly
temporary
pending
a
meeting
of
the
general
assembly
to
choose
a
new
head
for
popeek
but
ludwig
had
maintained
it
might
be
weeks
or
months
before
such
a
meeting
could
be
held
and
that
there
was
no
harm
in
identifying
his
office
everything
under
control
the
un
man
asked
walton
eyed
him
unhappily
i
guess
so
now
all
i
have
to
do
is
start
figuring
out
how
fitzmaugham
filing
system
worked
and
i
be
all
set
you
mean
you
do
know
fitzmaugham
took
very
few
people
into
his
confidence
walton
said
popeek
was
his
special
he
had
lived
with
it
so
long
he
thought
its
workings
were
to
everyone
there
be
a
period
of
adjustment
of
course
ludwig
said
this
conference
you
were
going
to
have
with
the
director
yesterday
when
he
ah
what
was
it
about
walton
asked
the
un
man
shrugged
it
irrelevant
now
i
suppose
i
wanted
to
find
out
how
popeek
subsidiary
research
lines
were
coming
along
but
i
guess
you
have
to
go
through
fitzmaugham
files
before
you
know
anything
eh
ludwig
stared
at
him
sharply
suddenly
walton
did
not
like
the
cheerful
un
man
there
be
a
certain
period
of
adjustment
he
repeated
i
let
you
know
when
i
ready
to
answer
questions
about
popeek
of
course
i
did
mean
to
imply
any
criticism
of
you
or
of
the
late
director
or
of
popeek
mr
walton
naturally
i
understand
mr
ludwig
ludwig
took
his
leave
at
last
and
walton
was
alone
in
the
late
fitzmaugham
office
for
the
first
time
since
the
assassination
he
spread
his
hands
on
the
highly
polished
desk
and
twisted
his
wrists
outward
in
a
tense
gesture
his
fingers
made
squeaking
sounds
as
they
rubbed
the
wood
surface
it
had
been
an
uneasy
afternoon
yesterday
after
the
nightmare
of
the
assassination
and
the
subsequent
security
inquisition
walton
wrung
dry
had
gone
home
early
leaving
popeek
headless
for
two
hours
the
newsblares
in
the
jetbus
had
been
programmed
with
nothing
but
talk
of
the
killing
a
brutal
hand
today
struck
down
the
revered
fitzmaugham
director
of
population
equalization
security
officials
report
definite
prospects
of
solution
of
the
shocking
crime
and
the
other
riders
in
the
bus
had
been
vehemently
outspoken
it
about
time
they
let
him
have
it
a
fat
woman
in
sleazy
old
clothes
said
that
baby
killer
i
knew
they
get
him
sooner
or
later
offered
a
thin
old
man
they
to
rumor
going
around
he
was
really
a
herschelite
some
new
kid
is
taking
over
popeek
they
say
they
get
him
too
mark
my
words
walton
huddling
in
his
seat
pulled
up
his
collar
and
tried
to
shut
his
ears
it
did
work
get
him
too
mark
my
he
had
forgotten
that
prophecy
by
the
time
he
reached
his
cubicle
in
upper
manhattan
the
harsh
words
had
drifted
through
his
restless
sleep
all
night
now
behind
the
safety
of
his
office
door
he
thought
of
them
again
he
could
hide
it
had
worked
for
fitzmaugham
and
it
would
for
him
hiding
was
the
answer
walton
smiled
grimly
if
martyrdom
were
in
store
for
him
let
martyrdom
come
the
work
of
popeek
had
to
go
forward
he
decided
he
would
conduct
as
much
of
his
official
business
as
possible
by
screen
but
when
personal
contact
was
necessary
he
would
make
no
attempt
to
avoid
it
he
glanced
around
fitzmaugham
office
the
director
had
been
a
product
of
the
last
century
and
he
had
seen
nothing
ugly
in
the
furnishings
of
the
cullen
building
unlike
walton
then
he
had
not
had
his
office
remodeled
that
would
be
one
of
the
first
tasks
to
replace
the
clumsy
battery
of
incandescents
with
a
wall
of
electroluminescents
to
replace
the
creaking
sash
windows
with
some
decent
opaquers
to
get
rid
of
the
accursed
gingerbread
trimming
that
offended
the
eye
in
every
direction
the
would
have
to
go
too
he
have
a
molecusorter
installed
in
a
day
or
two
the
redecorating
problems
were
the
minor
ones
it
was
the
task
of
filling
fitzmaugham
giant
shoes
even
on
an
interim
basis
that
staggered
walton
he
fumbled
in
the
desk
for
a
pad
and
stylus
this
was
going
to
call
for
an
agenda
hastily
he
wrote
cancel
f
investigate
setup
in
lang
terraforming
budget
stretchable
locate
spy
pickups
in
meeting
with
section
press
conference
with
telefax
see
ludwig
straighten
things
redecorate
he
thought
for
a
moment
then
erased
a
few
of
his
numbers
and
changed
to
and
to
he
licked
the
stylus
and
wrote
in
at
the
very
top
of
the
paper
finish
prior
in
a
way
fitzmaugham
assassination
had
taken
walton
off
the
hook
on
the
prior
case
whatever
fitzmaugham
suspected
about
activities
yesterday
morning
no
longer
need
trouble
him
if
the
director
had
jotted
down
a
memorandum
on
the
subject
walton
would
be
able
to
find
and
destroy
it
when
he
went
through
fitzmaugham
files
later
and
if
the
dead
man
had
merely
kept
the
matter
in
his
head
well
then
it
was
safely
at
rest
in
the
crematorium
walton
groped
in
his
jacket
pocket
and
found
the
note
his
brother
had
slipped
to
him
at
lunchtime
the
day
before
in
the
rush
of
events
walton
had
not
had
a
chance
to
destroy
it
now
he
read
it
once
more
ripped
it
in
half
ripped
it
again
and
fed
one
quarter
of
the
note
into
the
disposal
chute
he
would
get
rid
of
the
rest
at
intervals
and
he
would
defy
anyone
monitoring
the
disposal
units
to
locate
all
four
fragments
actually
he
realized
he
was
being
overcautious
this
was
director
fitzmaugham
office
and
fitzmaugham
disposal
chute
the
director
would
have
arranged
to
have
his
chute
monitored
would
he
or
would
he
there
was
never
any
telling
with
fitzmaugham
the
old
man
had
been
terribly
devious
in
every
maneuver
he
made
the
room
had
the
dry
crisp
smell
of
the
detecting
devices
that
had
been
used
the
ugly
that
had
crawled
all
over
the
floor
sniffing
up
footprints
and
stray
dandruff
flakes
for
analysis
the
chemical
cleansers
that
had
mopped
the
blood
out
of
the
rug
walton
cursed
at
the
that
was
so
inefficiently
removing
these
smells
from
the
air
the
annunciator
chimed
walton
waited
impatiently
for
a
voice
then
remembered
that
fitzmaugham
had
doggedly
required
an
acknowledgment
he
opened
the
channel
and
said
this
is
walton
in
the
future
no
acknowledgment
will
be
necessary
yes
sir
there
a
reporter
from
here
and
one
from
globe
telefax
tell
them
i
not
seeing
anyone
today
here
i
give
them
a
statement
tell
them
the
gargantuan
task
of
picking
up
the
reins
where
the
late
great
director
fitzmaugham
dropped
them
is
one
that
will
require
my
full
energy
for
the
next
several
days
i
be
happy
to
hold
my
first
official
press
conference
as
soon
as
popeek
is
once
again
moving
on
an
even
keel
got
that
yes
sir
good
make
sure
they
print
it
and
oh
listen
if
anyone
shows
up
today
or
tomorrow
who
had
an
appointment
with
director
fitzmaugham
tell
him
approximately
the
same
thing
not
in
those
flowery
words
of
course
but
give
him
the
gist
of
it
i
got
a
lot
of
catching
up
to
do
before
i
can
see
people
certainly
director
walton
he
grinned
at
the
sound
of
those
words
turning
away
from
the
annunciator
he
took
out
his
agenda
and
checked
off
number
one
fitzmaugham
frowning
he
realized
he
had
better
add
a
seventh
item
to
the
list
new
assistant
someone
would
have
to
handle
his
old
job
but
now
top
priority
went
to
the
item
ticketed
zero
on
the
list
prior
he
never
be
in
a
better
position
to
erase
the
evidence
of
yesterday
illegality
than
he
was
right
now
connect
me
with
euthanasia
files
please
a
moment
later
a
dry
voice
said
files
files
this
is
acting
director
walton
i
like
a
complete
transcript
of
your
computer
activities
for
yesterday
morning
between
and
with
each
separate
activity
itemized
how
soon
can
i
have
it
within
minutes
director
walton
good
send
it
sealed
by
closed
circuit
there
some
stuff
on
that
transcript
if
the
seal
not
intact
when
it
gets
here
shake
up
the
whole
department
yes
sir
anything
else
sir
no
that
be
on
second
thought
yes
send
up
a
list
of
all
doctors
who
were
examining
babies
in
the
clinic
yesterday
morning
he
waited
while
he
waited
he
went
through
the
top
layer
of
memoranda
in
fitzmaugham
desk
there
was
a
note
on
top
which
read
with
lamarre
june
must
be
firm
with
him
and
must
handle
with
great
delicacy
perhaps
time
to
let
walton
hmm
that
was
interesting
walton
thought
he
had
no
idea
who
lamarre
might
be
but
fitzmaugham
had
drawn
a
spidery
little
star
in
the
corner
of
the
memo
sheet
indicating
crash
priority
he
flipped
on
the
annunciator
there
a
lamarre
who
had
an
appointment
with
director
fitzmaugham
for
today
if
he
calls
tell
him
i
ca
see
him
today
but
will
honor
the
appointment
tomorrow
at
the
same
time
if
he
shows
up
tell
him
the
same
thing
his
watch
said
it
was
time
to
dispose
of
another
fragment
of
message
he
stuffed
it
into
the
disposal
chute
a
moment
later
the
green
light
flashed
over
the
arrival
bin
fitzmaugham
had
not
been
subject
as
walton
had
been
in
his
previous
office
to
cascades
of
material
arriving
without
warning
walton
drew
a
sealed
packet
from
the
bin
he
examined
the
seal
and
found
it
untampered
which
was
good
it
meant
the
packet
had
come
straight
from
the
computer
and
had
not
even
been
read
by
the
technician
in
charge
with
it
was
a
typed
list
of
five
names
the
doctors
who
had
been
in
the
lab
the
day
before
breaking
open
the
packet
walton
discovered
seven
sheets
with
a
series
of
itemized
actions
on
them
he
ran
through
them
quickly
discarding
sheets
one
two
and
three
which
dealt
with
routine
activities
of
the
computer
in
the
early
hours
of
the
previous
day
item
was
his
request
for
philip
prior
record
card
he
checked
that
one
off
item
was
his
requisition
for
the
key
to
the
code
item
was
his
revision
of
philip
prior
records
omitting
all
reference
to
his
tubercular
condition
and
to
the
euthanasia
recommendation
item
was
the
acknowledgment
of
this
revision
item
was
his
request
for
the
boy
record
card
this
time
the
amended
one
the
five
items
were
dated
and
timed
the
earliest
was
the
latest
all
on
june
tenth
walton
bracketed
the
five
items
thoughtfully
and
scanned
the
rest
of
the
page
nothing
of
interest
there
just
more
routine
business
but
item
timed
at
was
an
intriguing
one
full
transcript
of
morning
transactions
issued
at
request
of
frederic
walton
fred
had
been
bluffing
then
he
actually
had
possession
of
all
the
damning
evidence
but
when
one
dealt
with
a
computer
and
with
donnerson
the
past
was
an
extremely
fluid
entity
i
want
a
direct
line
to
the
computer
on
floor
twenty
he
said
after
a
brief
lag
a
technician
appeared
on
the
screen
it
was
the
same
one
he
had
spoken
to
earlier
there
been
an
error
in
the
records
walton
said
an
error
i
would
want
to
perpetuate
will
you
set
me
up
so
i
can
feed
a
direct
order
into
the
machine
certainly
sir
go
ahead
sir
this
is
top
secret
vanish
the
technician
vanished
walton
said
items
through
on
yesterday
morning
record
tape
are
to
be
deleted
and
the
information
carried
in
those
tubes
is
to
be
deleted
as
well
furthermore
there
is
to
be
no
record
made
of
this
transaction
the
voicewrite
on
floor
twenty
clattered
briefly
and
the
order
funneled
into
the
computer
walton
waited
a
moment
tensely
then
he
said
all
right
technician
come
back
in
where
i
can
see
you
the
technician
appeared
walton
said
i
running
a
check
now
have
the
machine
prepare
another
transcript
of
yesterday
activities
between
and
and
also
one
of
today
doings
for
the
last
fifteen
minutes
right
away
sir
while
he
waited
for
the
new
transcripts
to
arrive
walton
studied
the
list
of
names
on
his
desk
five
doctors
gunther
raymond
archer
hsi
rein
he
did
know
which
one
of
them
had
examined
the
prior
baby
nor
did
he
care
to
find
out
all
five
would
have
to
be
transferred
meticulously
he
took
up
his
stylus
and
pad
again
and
plotted
a
destination
for
each
tierra
del
he
nodded
that
was
optimum
dissemination
he
would
put
through
notice
of
the
transfers
later
in
the
day
and
by
nightfall
the
men
would
be
on
their
way
to
their
new
scenes
of
operation
perhaps
they
would
never
understand
why
they
had
been
uprooted
and
sent
away
from
new
york
the
new
transcripts
arrived
impatiently
walton
checked
through
them
in
the
june
tenth
transcript
item
dealt
with
smallpox
statistics
for
north
america
and
item
with
the
tally
of
antihistamine
supply
for
requisitions
for
clinic
three
there
was
no
sign
of
any
of
walton
requests
they
had
vanished
from
the
record
as
completely
as
if
they
had
never
been
walton
searched
carefully
through
the
june
eleventh
transcript
for
any
mention
of
his
deletion
order
no
that
had
been
recorded
either
he
smiled
his
first
honest
smile
since
fitzmaugham
assassination
now
with
the
computer
records
erased
the
director
dead
and
the
doctors
on
their
way
elsewhere
only
fred
stood
in
the
way
of
chance
of
escaping
punishment
for
the
prior
business
he
decided
he
have
to
take
his
chances
with
fred
perhaps
brotherly
love
would
seal
his
lips
after
all
vi
the
late
director
fitzmaugham
files
were
spread
over
four
floors
of
the
building
but
for
walton
purposes
the
only
ones
that
mattered
were
those
to
which
access
was
gained
through
the
director
office
alone
a
keyboard
and
screen
were
set
into
the
wall
to
the
left
of
the
desk
walton
let
his
fingers
rest
lightly
on
the
gleaming
keys
the
main
problem
facing
him
he
thought
lay
in
not
knowing
where
to
begin
despite
his
careful
agenda
despite
the
necessary
marshaling
of
his
thoughts
he
was
still
confused
by
the
enormity
of
his
job
the
seven
billion
people
of
the
world
were
in
his
hands
he
could
transfer
fifty
thousand
new
yorkers
to
the
bleak
northern
provinces
of
underpopulated
canada
with
the
same
quick
ease
that
he
had
shifted
five
unsuspecting
doctors
half
an
hour
before
after
a
few
moments
of
uneasy
thought
he
pecked
out
the
short
message
complete
data
file
on
terraforming
on
the
screen
appeared
the
words
and
coded
prepare
to
the
arrival
bin
thrummed
with
activity
walton
hastily
scooped
out
a
double
handful
of
typed
sheets
to
make
room
for
more
he
grinned
in
anguish
as
the
paper
kept
on
coming
fitzmaugham
files
on
terraforming
no
doubt
covered
reams
and
reams
staggering
he
carted
it
all
over
to
his
desk
and
began
to
skim
through
it
the
data
began
thirty
years
earlier
in
with
a
photostat
of
a
letter
from
herbert
lang
to
fitzmaugham
proposing
a
project
whereby
the
inner
planets
of
the
solar
system
could
be
made
habitable
by
human
beings
appended
to
that
was
fitzmaugham
skeptical
slightly
mocking
reply
the
old
man
had
kept
everything
it
seemed
even
letters
which
showed
him
in
a
bad
light
after
that
came
more
letters
from
lang
urging
fitzmaugham
to
plead
terraforming
case
before
the
united
states
senate
and
increasingly
more
enthusiastic
answers
finally
in
a
notation
that
the
senate
had
voted
a
appropriation
to
lang
a
miniscule
amount
in
terms
of
the
overall
need
but
it
was
enough
to
cover
preliminary
research
lang
had
been
grateful
walton
skimmed
through
familiar
documents
on
the
nature
of
the
terraforming
project
he
could
study
those
in
detail
later
if
time
permitted
what
he
wanted
now
was
information
on
the
current
status
of
the
project
fitzmaugham
had
been
remarkably
silent
about
it
though
the
public
impression
had
been
created
that
a
team
of
engineers
headed
by
lang
was
already
at
work
on
venus
he
shoved
whole
handfuls
of
letters
to
one
side
looking
for
those
of
recent
date
here
was
one
dated
feb
fitzmaugham
to
lang
it
informed
the
scientist
that
passage
of
the
equalization
act
was
imminent
and
that
lang
stood
to
get
a
substantial
appropriation
from
the
un
in
that
event
a
jubilant
reply
from
lang
was
attached
following
that
came
another
may
fitzmaugham
to
lang
official
authorization
of
lang
as
an
executive
member
of
popeek
and
appropriation
of
walton
eyes
bugged
five
billion
dollars
for
terraforming
research
note
from
lang
to
fitzmaugham
may
the
terraforming
crew
was
leaving
for
venus
immediately
note
from
fitzmaugham
to
lang
may
best
wishes
and
lang
was
instructed
to
contact
fitzmaugham
without
fail
at
weekly
intervals
spacegram
from
lang
to
fitzmaugham
may
arrived
at
venus
safely
preparing
operation
as
scheduled
the
file
ended
there
walton
rummaged
through
the
huge
heap
hoping
to
discover
a
later
communiqu√©
by
fitzmaugham
own
request
lang
should
have
contacted
popeek
about
four
days
ago
with
his
first
report
possibly
it
had
gone
astray
in
delivery
walton
thought
he
spent
twenty
minutes
digging
through
the
assorted
material
before
remembering
that
he
could
get
a
replacement
within
seconds
from
the
filing
computer
he
typed
out
a
requisition
for
any
and
all
correspondence
between
director
fitzmaugham
and
herbert
lang
that
was
dated
after
may
the
machine
acknowledged
and
a
moment
later
replied
material
is
not
included
in
memory
walton
frowned
gathered
up
most
of
his
superfluous
terraforming
data
and
deposited
it
in
a
file
drawer
the
status
of
the
project
then
was
uncertain
the
terraformers
were
on
venus
and
presumably
at
work
but
were
yet
to
be
heard
from
the
next
popeek
project
to
track
down
would
be
the
spaceship
drive
but
after
the
mass
of
data
walton
had
just
absorbed
he
found
himself
hesitant
to
wade
through
another
collection
so
soon
he
realized
that
he
was
hungry
for
the
sight
of
another
human
being
he
had
spent
the
whole
morning
alone
speaking
to
anonymous
underlings
via
screen
or
annunciator
and
requisitioning
material
from
an
even
more
impersonal
computer
he
wanted
noise
life
people
around
him
he
snapped
on
the
annunciator
i
calling
an
immediate
meeting
of
the
popeek
section
chiefs
he
said
in
my
office
in
half
an
hour
at
sharp
tell
them
to
drop
whatever
they
doing
and
come
just
before
they
started
to
arrive
walton
felt
a
sudden
sick
wave
of
tension
sweep
dizzyingly
over
him
he
pulled
open
the
top
drawer
of
his
new
desk
and
reached
for
his
tranquilizer
tablets
he
suffered
a
moment
of
shock
and
disorientation
before
he
realized
that
this
was
fitzmaugham
desk
not
his
own
and
that
fitzmaugham
forswore
all
forms
of
sedation
chuckling
nervously
walton
drew
out
his
wallet
and
extracted
the
extra
benzolurethrin
he
carried
for
just
such
emergencies
he
popped
the
lozenge
into
his
mouth
only
a
moment
before
the
spare
figure
of
lee
percy
first
of
the
section
chiefs
to
arrive
appeared
in
the
screener
outside
the
door
roy
it
me
percy
i
can
see
you
come
on
in
lee
percy
was
in
charge
of
public
relations
for
popeek
he
was
a
tall
angular
man
with
thick
corrugated
features
after
him
came
teddy
schaunhaft
clinic
coordinator
pauline
medhurst
personnel
director
olaf
eglin
director
of
field
agents
and
sue
llewellyn
popeek
comptroller
these
five
had
constituted
the
central
council
of
popeek
walton
as
assistant
administrator
had
served
as
their
coordinator
as
well
as
handling
population
transfer
and
serving
as
a
funnel
for
red
tape
above
them
all
had
been
fitzmaugham
brooding
over
his
charges
like
an
untroubled
wotan
fitzmaugham
had
reserved
for
himself
aside
from
the
task
of
general
supervision
the
special
duties
attendant
on
handling
the
terraforming
and
wings
of
popeek
i
should
have
called
you
together
much
earlier
than
this
walton
said
when
they
were
settled
the
shock
though
and
the
general
confusion
we
understand
roy
said
sue
llewellyn
sympathetically
she
was
a
chubby
little
woman
in
her
fifties
whose
private
life
was
reported
to
be
incredibly
at
variance
with
her
pleasantly
domestic
appearance
it
been
rough
on
all
of
us
but
you
were
so
close
to
fitzmaugham
there
was
sympathetic
clucking
from
various
corners
of
the
room
walton
said
the
period
of
mourning
will
have
to
be
a
brief
one
what
suggesting
is
that
business
continue
as
usual
without
a
hitch
he
glanced
at
eglin
the
director
of
field
agents
olaf
is
there
a
man
in
your
section
capable
of
handling
your
job
eglin
looked
astonished
for
a
moment
then
mastered
himself
there
must
be
five
at
least
walters
lassen
dominic
skip
the
catalogue
walton
told
him
pick
the
man
you
think
is
best
suited
to
replace
you
and
send
his
dossier
up
to
me
for
approval
and
where
do
go
you
take
over
my
slot
as
assistant
administrator
as
director
of
field
agents
you
more
familiar
with
the
immediate
problems
of
my
old
job
than
anyone
else
here
eglin
preened
himself
smugly
walton
wondered
if
he
had
made
an
unwise
choice
eglin
was
competent
enough
and
would
give
forth
one
hundred
percent
effort
at
all
times
but
probably
never
the
one
hundred
two
percent
a
really
great
administrator
could
put
out
when
necessary
still
the
post
had
to
be
filled
at
once
and
eglin
could
pick
up
the
reins
faster
than
any
of
the
others
walton
looked
around
otherwise
activities
of
popeek
will
continue
as
under
fitzmaugham
without
a
hitch
any
questions
lee
percy
raised
an
arm
slowly
roy
i
got
a
problem
i
like
to
bring
up
here
as
long
as
we
all
together
there
a
growing
public
sentiment
that
you
and
the
late
director
were
secretly
herschelites
he
chuckled
apologetically
i
know
it
sounds
silly
but
i
just
report
what
i
hear
i
familiar
with
the
rumor
walton
said
and
i
do
like
it
much
either
that
the
sort
of
stuff
riots
are
made
of
the
herschelites
were
extremists
who
advocated
wholesale
sterilization
of
defectives
mandatory
birth
control
and
half
a
dozen
other
stringent
remedies
for
overpopulation
what
steps
are
you
taking
to
counteract
it
walton
asked
well
said
percy
we
preparing
a
memorial
program
for
fitzmaugham
which
will
intimate
that
he
was
murdered
by
the
herschelites
who
hated
him
good
what
the
slant
that
he
was
too
easygoing
too
humane
we
build
up
the
herschelites
as
ultrareactionaries
who
intend
to
enforce
their
will
on
humanity
if
they
get
the
chance
and
imply
fitzmaugham
was
fighting
them
tooth
and
nail
we
close
the
show
with
some
shots
of
you
picking
up
the
great
mantle
etcetera
etcetera
and
a
short
speech
from
you
affirming
the
basically
humanitarian
aims
of
popeek
walton
smiled
approvingly
and
said
i
like
it
when
do
you
want
me
to
do
the
speech
we
wo
need
you
percy
told
him
we
got
plenty
of
stock
footage
and
we
can
whip
the
speech
out
of
some
spare
syllables
you
left
around
walton
frowned
too
many
of
the
public
speeches
of
the
day
were
synthetic
created
by
skilled
engineers
who
split
words
into
their
component
phonemes
and
reassembled
them
in
any
shape
they
pleased
let
me
check
through
my
speech
before
you
put
it
over
at
least
will
do
and
we
squash
this
herschelite
thing
right
off
the
bat
pauline
medhurst
squirmed
uneasily
in
her
chair
walton
caught
the
hint
and
recognized
her
uh
roy
i
do
know
if
this
is
the
time
or
the
place
but
i
got
that
transfer
order
of
yours
the
five
doctors
you
did
good
walton
said
hurriedly
have
you
notified
them
yet
yes
they
seemed
unhappy
about
it
refer
them
to
fitzmaugham
book
tell
them
they
cogs
in
a
mighty
machine
working
to
save
humanity
we
ca
let
personal
considerations
interefere
pauline
if
you
could
only
explain
why
yeah
interjected
schaunhaft
the
clinic
coordinator
suddenly
you
cleaned
out
my
whole
morning
lab
shift
down
there
i
was
wondering
walton
felt
like
a
stag
at
bay
look
he
said
firmly
cutting
through
the
hubbub
made
the
transfer
i
had
reasons
for
doing
it
it
your
job
to
get
the
five
men
out
where
they
been
assigned
and
to
get
five
new
men
in
here
at
once
you
not
required
to
make
explanations
to
them
nor
i
to
you
sudden
silence
fell
over
the
office
walton
hoped
he
had
not
been
too
forceful
and
cast
suspicion
on
his
actions
by
his
stiffness
whew
sue
llewellyn
said
you
really
mean
business
i
said
we
were
going
to
run
popeek
without
a
hitch
walton
replied
just
because
you
know
my
first
name
that
does
mean
i
not
going
to
be
as
strong
a
director
as
fitzmaugham
was
the
un
picks
my
his
mind
added
out
loud
he
said
unless
you
have
any
further
questions
i
ask
you
now
to
return
to
your
respective
sections
he
sat
slumped
at
his
desk
after
they
were
gone
trying
to
draw
on
some
inner
reserve
of
energy
for
the
strength
to
go
on
one
day
at
the
job
and
he
was
tired
terribly
tired
and
it
would
be
six
weeks
or
more
before
the
united
nations
convened
to
choose
the
next
director
of
popeek
he
did
know
who
that
man
would
be
he
expected
they
would
offer
the
job
to
him
provided
he
did
competent
work
during
the
interim
but
wearily
he
saw
he
would
have
to
turn
the
offer
down
it
was
not
only
that
his
nerves
could
handle
the
grinding
daily
tension
of
the
job
he
saw
now
what
fred
might
be
up
to
and
it
stung
what
if
his
brother
were
to
hold
off
exposing
him
until
the
moment
the
un
proffered
its
appointment
and
then
took
that
moment
to
reveal
that
the
head
of
popeek
far
from
being
an
herschelite
had
actually
been
guilty
of
an
irregularity
that
transgressed
against
one
of
popeek
own
operations
he
be
finished
he
be
laughed
out
of
public
life
for
good
and
probably
prosecuted
in
the
bargain
if
fred
exposed
him
and
fred
was
perfectly
capable
of
doing
just
that
walton
saw
himself
spinning
dizzily
between
conflicting
alternatives
keep
the
job
and
face
his
brother
expos√©
or
resign
and
vanish
into
anonymity
neither
choice
seemed
too
appealing
shrugging
he
dragged
himself
out
of
his
chair
determined
to
shroud
his
conflict
behind
the
mask
of
work
he
typed
a
request
to
files
requisitioning
data
on
the
project
moments
later
the
torrent
began
rising
from
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
giant
computer
rumbling
upward
through
the
conveyor
system
moving
onward
toward
the
floor
and
the
office
of
interim
director
walton
vii
the
next
morning
there
was
a
crowd
gathered
before
the
cullen
building
when
walton
arrived
there
must
have
been
at
least
a
hundred
people
fanning
outward
from
a
central
focus
walton
stepped
from
the
jetbus
and
with
collar
pulled
up
carefully
to
obscure
as
much
of
his
face
as
possible
went
to
investigate
a
small
man
stood
on
a
rickety
chair
against
the
side
of
the
building
he
was
flanked
by
a
pair
of
brass
flagpoles
one
bearing
the
american
flag
and
the
other
the
ensign
of
the
united
nations
his
voice
was
a
biting
rasp
probably
thought
walton
intensified
sharpened
and
made
more
irritating
by
a
harmonic
modulator
at
his
throat
an
irritating
voice
put
its
message
across
twice
as
fast
as
a
pleasant
one
he
was
shouting
this
is
the
place
up
here
in
this
building
where
they
are
that
where
popeek
wastes
our
money
from
the
slant
of
the
man
words
walton
instantly
thought
he
repressed
his
anger
and
for
once
decided
to
stay
and
hear
the
extremist
out
he
had
never
really
paid
much
attention
to
herschelite
propaganda
he
had
been
exposed
to
little
of
it
and
he
realized
that
now
as
head
of
popeek
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
become
familiar
with
the
arguments
of
both
extremist
factions
those
who
insisted
popeek
was
a
tyranny
and
the
herschelites
who
thought
it
was
too
weak
this
popeek
the
little
man
said
accenting
the
awkwardness
of
the
word
you
know
what
it
is
it
a
stopgap
it
a
silly
attempt
at
solving
our
problems
it
a
fake
a
fraud
a
phony
there
was
real
passion
behind
the
words
walton
distrusted
small
men
with
deep
wells
of
passion
he
no
more
enjoyed
their
company
than
he
did
that
of
a
dynamo
or
an
atomic
pile
they
were
always
threatening
to
explode
the
crowd
was
stirring
restlessly
the
herschelite
was
getting
to
them
one
way
or
another
walton
drew
back
nervously
not
wanting
to
be
recognized
and
stationed
himself
at
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
some
of
you
do
like
popeek
for
this
reason
or
that
reason
but
let
me
tell
you
something
friends
you
wronger
than
they
are
got
to
get
tough
with
ourselves
we
have
to
face
the
truth
popeek
is
an
unrealistic
to
man
problems
until
we
limit
birth
establish
rigid
controls
over
who
going
to
live
and
who
is
we
it
was
straight
herschelite
propaganda
undiluted
walton
surprised
when
someone
in
the
audience
interrupted
growling
and
who
going
to
set
those
controls
you
you
trusted
yourselves
to
popeek
did
you
why
hesitate
then
to
trust
yourselves
to
abel
herschel
and
his
group
of
workers
for
the
betterment
and
purification
of
mankind
walton
was
almost
limp
with
amazement
the
herschelite
group
was
so
much
more
drastic
in
its
approach
than
popeek
that
he
wondered
how
they
dared
come
out
with
these
views
in
public
animosity
was
high
enough
against
popeek
would
the
public
accept
a
group
more
stringent
yet
the
little
man
voice
rose
high
onward
with
the
herschelites
mankind
must
move
forward
the
equalization
people
represent
the
forces
of
decay
and
sloth
walton
turned
to
the
man
next
to
him
and
murmured
but
herschel
a
fanatic
they
kill
all
of
us
in
the
name
of
mankind
the
man
looked
puzzled
then
accepting
the
idea
he
nodded
yeah
buddy
you
know
you
may
have
something
there
that
was
all
the
spark
needed
walton
edged
away
surreptitiously
and
watched
it
spread
through
the
crowd
while
the
little
man
harangue
grew
more
and
more
inflammatory
until
a
rock
arced
through
the
air
from
somewhere
whipped
across
the
billowing
un
flag
and
cracked
into
the
side
of
the
building
that
was
the
signal
a
hundred
men
and
women
converged
on
the
little
man
on
the
battered
chair
have
to
face
the
truth
the
harsh
voice
cried
then
the
flags
were
swept
down
trampled
on
flagpoles
fell
ringing
metallically
on
the
concrete
the
chair
toppled
the
little
man
was
lost
beneath
a
tide
of
remorseless
feet
and
arms
a
siren
screamed
cops
walton
yelled
from
his
vantage
point
some
thirty
feet
away
and
abruptly
the
crowd
melted
away
in
all
directions
leaving
walton
and
the
little
man
alone
on
the
street
a
security
wagon
drew
up
four
men
in
gray
uniforms
sprang
out
what
been
going
on
here
who
this
man
then
seeing
walton
hey
come
over
here
of
course
officer
walton
turned
his
collar
down
and
drew
near
he
spotted
the
glare
of
a
ubiquitous
video
camera
and
faced
it
squarely
i
director
walton
of
popeek
he
said
loudly
into
the
camera
i
just
arrived
here
a
few
minutes
ago
i
saw
the
whole
thing
tell
us
about
it
walton
the
security
man
said
it
was
a
herschelite
walton
gestured
at
the
broken
body
crumpled
against
the
ground
he
was
delivering
an
inflammatory
speech
aimed
against
popeek
with
special
reference
to
the
late
director
fitzmaugham
and
myself
i
was
about
to
summon
you
and
end
the
disturbance
when
the
listeners
became
aware
that
the
man
was
a
herschelite
when
they
understood
what
he
was
advocating
they
well
you
see
the
result
thank
you
sir
terribly
sorry
we
could
have
prevented
it
must
be
very
unpleasant
mr
walton
the
man
was
asking
for
trouble
walton
said
popeek
represents
the
minds
and
hearts
of
the
world
herschel
and
his
people
seek
to
overthrow
this
order
i
ca
condone
violence
of
any
sort
naturally
but
he
smiled
into
the
camera
popeek
is
a
sacred
responsibility
to
me
its
enemies
i
must
regard
as
blind
and
misguided
people
he
turned
and
entered
the
building
feeling
pleased
with
himself
that
sequence
would
be
shown
globally
on
the
next
news
screenings
every
newsblare
in
the
world
would
be
reporting
his
words
lee
percy
would
be
proud
of
him
without
benefit
either
of
rehearsal
or
phonemic
engineering
walton
had
delivered
a
rousing
speech
and
turned
a
grisly
incident
into
a
major
propaganda
instrument
and
more
than
that
director
fitzmaugham
would
have
been
proud
of
him
but
beneath
the
glow
of
pride
he
was
trembling
yesterday
he
had
saved
a
boy
by
a
trifling
alteration
of
his
genetic
record
today
he
had
killed
a
man
by
sending
a
whispered
accusation
rustling
through
a
mob
popeek
represented
power
perhaps
the
greatest
power
in
the
world
that
power
would
have
to
be
channeled
somehow
now
that
it
had
been
unleashed
the
stack
of
papers
relating
to
the
superspeed
space
drive
was
still
on
his
desk
when
he
entered
the
office
he
had
had
time
yesterday
to
read
through
just
some
of
the
earliest
then
the
pressure
of
routine
had
dragged
him
off
to
other
duties
encouraged
by
fitzmaugham
the
project
had
originated
about
a
decade
or
so
before
it
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
the
used
for
travel
between
planets
had
a
top
velocity
a
limiting
factor
of
about
ninety
thousand
miles
per
second
at
that
rate
it
would
take
some
eighteen
years
for
a
scouting
party
to
visit
the
closest
star
and
report
back
not
very
efficient
for
a
planet
in
a
hurry
to
expand
outward
a
group
of
scientists
had
set
to
work
developing
a
subspace
warp
drive
one
that
would
cut
across
the
manifold
of
normal
space
and
allow
speeds
above
light
velocity
all
the
records
were
here
the
preliminary
trials
the
budget
allocations
the
sketches
and
plans
the
names
of
the
researchers
walton
ploughed
painstakingly
through
them
learning
names
assimilating
scientific
data
it
seemed
that
while
it
was
still
in
its
early
stages
fitzmaugham
had
nurtured
the
project
along
with
money
from
his
personal
fortune
for
most
of
the
morning
walton
leafed
through
documents
describing
projected
generators
types
of
hull
material
specifications
speculations
it
was
nearly
noon
when
he
came
across
the
note
from
colonel
leslie
mcleod
one
of
the
military
scientists
in
charge
of
the
ultradrive
project
walton
read
it
through
once
gasped
and
read
it
again
it
was
dated
june
almost
one
year
ago
it
read
dear
fitzmaugham
sure
it
will
gladden
you
to
learn
that
we
have
at
last
achieved
success
in
our
endeavors
the
passed
its
last
tests
splendidly
and
we
are
ready
to
leave
on
the
preliminary
scouting
flight
at
mcleod
it
was
followed
by
a
note
from
fitzmaugham
to
mcleod
dated
june
mcleod
best
wishes
on
your
great
adventure
i
trust
you
be
departing
as
usual
from
the
nairobi
base
within
the
next
few
days
please
let
me
hear
from
you
before
the
file
concluded
with
a
final
note
from
mcleod
to
the
director
dated
june
dear
fitzmaugham
will
leave
nairobi
in
eleven
hours
bound
outward
manned
by
a
crew
of
sixteen
including
myself
the
men
are
all
impatient
for
the
departure
i
must
offer
my
hearty
thanks
for
the
help
you
have
given
us
over
the
past
years
without
which
we
would
never
have
reached
this
plans
include
visiting
several
of
the
nearer
stars
with
the
intention
of
returning
either
as
soon
as
we
have
discovered
a
habitable
extrasolar
world
or
one
year
after
departure
whichever
first
good
wishes
and
may
you
have
as
much
success
when
you
plead
your
case
before
the
united
nations
as
we
have
had
here
though
you
forgive
me
for
hoping
that
our
work
might
make
any
population
equalization
program
on
earth
totally
superfluous
walton
stared
at
the
three
notes
for
a
moment
so
shocked
he
was
unable
to
react
so
a
drive
was
not
merely
a
dream
but
an
actuality
with
the
first
scouting
mission
a
year
absent
already
he
felt
a
new
burst
of
admiration
for
fitzmaugham
what
a
marvelous
old
scoundrel
he
had
been
achieved
and
the
terraforming
group
on
venus
and
neither
fact
released
to
the
public
or
even
specifically
given
to
fitzmaugham
own
staff
his
alleged
confidants
it
had
been
shrewd
of
him
all
right
he
had
made
sure
nothing
could
go
wrong
if
something
happened
to
lang
and
his
crew
on
venus
and
it
was
quite
possible
since
word
from
them
was
a
week
overdue
it
would
be
easy
to
say
that
the
terraforming
project
was
still
in
the
planning
stage
in
the
event
of
success
the
excuse
was
that
word
of
their
progress
had
been
withheld
for
security
reasons
and
the
same
would
apply
to
the
space
drive
if
mcleod
and
his
men
vanished
into
the
nether
regions
of
interstellar
space
and
never
returned
fitzmaugham
would
not
have
had
to
answer
for
the
failure
of
a
project
which
as
far
as
the
public
knew
was
still
in
the
planning
stage
it
was
a
sword
with
the
director
controlling
both
edges
and
now
walton
was
in
charge
he
hoped
he
would
be
able
to
continue
manipulations
with
an
aplomb
worthy
of
the
late
director
fitzmaugham
the
annunciator
chimed
lamarre
is
here
for
his
appointment
with
you
mr
walton
walton
was
caught
off
guard
his
mind
raced
furiously
who
the
dickens
oh
that
appointment
of
tell
lamarre
i
be
glad
to
see
him
in
just
a
few
minutes
please
i
buzz
you
when
i
ready
hurriedly
he
gathered
up
the
documents
and
jammed
them
in
a
file
drawer
near
the
data
on
terraforming
he
surveyed
his
office
it
looked
neat
presentable
glancing
around
he
made
sure
no
stray
documents
were
visible
documents
which
might
reveal
the
truth
about
the
space
drive
send
in
lamarre
he
said
lamarre
was
a
short
thin
pale
individual
with
an
uncertain
wave
in
his
sandy
hair
and
a
slight
stoop
of
his
shoulders
he
carried
a
large
black
leather
portfolio
which
seemed
on
the
point
of
exploding
mr
walton
that
right
you
dr
lamarre
the
small
man
handed
him
an
engraved
business
card
elliot
walton
fingered
the
card
uneasily
and
returned
it
to
its
owner
gerontologist
one
who
studies
ways
of
increasing
the
human
precisely
walton
frowned
i
presume
you
had
some
previous
dealings
with
the
late
director
fitzmaugham
lamarre
gaped
you
mean
he
did
you
director
fitzmaugham
shared
very
little
information
with
his
assistants
lamarre
the
suddenness
of
my
elevation
to
this
post
gave
me
little
time
to
explore
his
files
would
you
mind
filling
me
in
on
the
background
of
course
lamarre
crossed
his
legs
and
squinted
myopically
across
the
desk
at
walton
to
be
brief
fitzmaugham
first
heard
of
my
work
fourteen
years
ago
since
that
time
he
supported
my
experiments
with
private
grants
of
his
own
public
appropriations
whenever
possible
and
lately
with
money
supplied
by
popeek
naturally
because
of
the
nature
of
my
work
i
shunned
publicity
i
completed
my
final
tests
last
week
and
was
to
have
seen
the
director
yesterday
but
i
know
i
was
busy
going
through
fitzmaugham
files
when
you
called
yesterday
i
did
have
time
to
see
anyone
walton
wished
he
had
checked
on
this
man
lamarre
earlier
apparently
it
was
a
private
project
of
fitzmaugham
and
of
some
importance
may
i
ask
what
this
of
yours
consists
of
certainly
fitzmaugham
expressed
a
hope
that
someday
man
life
span
might
be
infinitely
extended
i
happy
to
report
that
i
have
developed
a
simple
technique
which
will
provide
just
that
the
little
man
smiled
in
in
short
he
said
what
i
have
developed
in
everyday
terms
is
immortality
mr
walton
viii
walton
was
becoming
hardened
to
astonishment
the
further
he
excavated
into
the
late
director
affairs
the
less
susceptible
he
was
to
the
visceral
reaction
of
shock
still
this
stunned
him
for
a
moment
did
you
say
you
perfected
this
technique
he
asked
slowly
or
that
it
was
still
in
the
planning
stage
lamarre
tapped
the
thick
glossy
black
portfolio
in
here
i
got
it
all
he
seemed
ready
to
burst
with
walton
leaned
back
spread
his
fingers
against
the
surface
of
the
desk
and
wrinkled
his
forehead
i
had
this
job
since
on
the
tenth
lamarre
that
exactly
two
days
ago
minus
half
an
hour
and
in
that
time
i
do
think
i
had
less
than
ten
major
shocks
and
half
a
dozen
minor
ones
sir
what
i
getting
at
is
this
just
why
did
director
fitzmaugham
sponsor
this
project
of
yours
lamarre
looked
blank
because
the
director
was
a
great
humanitarian
of
course
because
he
felt
that
the
human
life
was
short
far
too
short
and
he
wished
his
fellow
men
to
enjoy
long
life
what
other
reason
should
there
be
i
know
fitzmaugham
was
a
great
man
i
was
his
secretary
for
three
years
he
never
said
a
word
about
you
walton
thought
but
to
develop
immortality
at
this
stage
of
existence
walton
shook
his
head
tell
me
about
your
work
dr
lamarre
it
difficult
to
sum
up
readily
i
fought
degeneration
of
the
body
on
the
cellular
level
and
my
tests
show
a
successful
outcome
phagocyte
stimulation
combined
with
the
data
all
here
walton
i
need
run
through
it
for
you
he
began
to
hunt
in
the
portfolio
fumbling
for
something
after
a
moment
he
extracted
a
folded
quarto
sheet
spread
it
out
and
nudged
it
across
the
desk
toward
walton
the
director
glanced
at
the
sheet
it
was
covered
with
chemical
equations
spare
me
the
technical
details
lamarre
have
you
tested
your
treatment
yet
with
the
only
test
possible
the
test
of
time
there
are
insects
in
my
laboratories
that
have
lived
five
years
or
more
veritable
methuselahs
of
their
genera
immortality
is
not
something
one
can
test
in
less
than
infinite
time
but
beneath
the
microscope
one
can
see
the
cells
regenerating
one
can
see
decay
combated
walton
took
a
deep
breath
are
you
aware
lamarre
that
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
i
really
should
have
you
shot
at
once
walton
nearly
burst
out
laughing
the
man
looked
outrageously
funny
with
that
look
of
shocked
incomprehension
on
his
face
do
you
understand
what
immortality
would
do
to
earth
he
asked
with
no
other
planet
of
the
solar
system
habitable
by
man
and
none
of
the
stars
within
reach
within
a
generation
we
be
living
ten
to
the
square
inch
we
director
fitzmaugham
was
aware
of
these
things
lamarre
interrupted
sharply
he
had
no
intention
of
administering
my
discovery
wholesale
to
the
populace
what
more
he
was
fully
confident
that
a
space
drive
would
soon
let
us
reach
the
planets
and
that
the
terraforming
engineers
would
succeed
with
their
work
on
venus
those
two
factors
are
still
unknowns
in
the
equation
walton
said
neither
has
succeeded
as
of
now
and
we
ca
possibly
let
word
of
your
discovery
get
out
until
there
are
avenues
to
handle
the
overflow
of
population
already
on
hand
so
you
propose
to
confiscate
the
notes
you
have
with
you
and
to
insist
that
you
remain
silent
about
this
serum
of
yours
until
i
give
you
permission
to
announce
it
and
if
i
refuse
walton
spread
his
hands
lamarre
i
a
reasonable
man
trying
to
do
a
very
hard
job
you
a
scientist
and
a
sane
one
i
hope
appreciate
your
cooperation
bear
with
me
a
few
weeks
and
then
perhaps
the
situation
will
change
awkward
silence
followed
finally
lamarre
said
very
well
if
return
my
notes
i
promise
to
keep
silent
until
you
give
me
permission
to
speak
that
wo
be
enough
i
need
to
keep
the
notes
lamarre
sighed
if
you
insist
he
said
when
he
was
again
alone
walton
stored
the
thick
portfolio
in
a
file
drawer
and
stared
at
it
quizzically
he
thought
were
incredible
lamarre
immortality
serum
or
whatever
it
was
was
deadly
whether
it
actually
worked
or
not
was
irrelevant
if
word
ever
escaped
that
an
immortality
drug
existed
there
would
be
rioting
and
death
on
a
vast
scale
fitzmaugham
had
certainly
seen
that
and
yet
he
had
sublimely
underwritten
development
of
the
serum
knowing
that
if
terraforming
and
the
ultradrive
project
should
fail
lamarre
project
represented
a
major
threat
to
civilization
well
lamarre
had
knuckled
under
to
walton
willingly
enough
the
problem
now
was
to
contact
lang
on
venus
and
find
out
what
was
happening
up
there
walton
said
the
annunciator
there
a
coded
message
arriving
for
director
fitzmaugham
where
from
from
space
sir
they
say
they
have
news
but
they
wo
give
it
to
anyone
but
mr
fitzmaugham
walton
cursed
where
is
this
message
being
received
floor
sir
communications
tell
them
i
be
right
down
walton
snapped
he
caught
a
lift
tube
and
arrived
on
the
floor
moments
later
no
sooner
had
the
tube
door
opened
than
he
sprang
out
dodging
around
a
pair
of
startled
technicians
and
sprinted
down
the
corridor
toward
communications
here
throbbed
the
network
that
held
the
branches
of
popeek
together
from
here
the
screens
were
powered
the
annunciators
were
linked
the
phones
connected
walton
pushed
open
a
door
marked
and
confronted
four
busy
engineers
who
were
crowded
around
a
complex
receiving
mechanism
where
that
space
message
he
demanded
of
the
sallow
young
engineer
who
approached
him
still
coming
in
sir
they
repeating
it
over
and
over
triangulating
their
position
now
somewhere
near
the
orbit
of
pluto
mr
walton
devil
with
that
where
the
message
someone
handed
him
a
slip
of
paper
it
said
earth
urgent
call
top
urgency
crash
urgency
will
communicate
only
with
this
all
it
is
walton
asked
no
signature
no
ship
name
that
right
mr
walton
okay
find
them
in
a
hurry
and
send
them
a
return
message
tell
them
fitzmaugham
dead
and
i
his
successor
mention
me
by
name
yes
sir
he
stamped
impatiently
around
the
lab
while
they
set
to
work
beaming
the
message
into
the
void
space
communication
was
a
field
that
dazzled
and
bewildered
walton
and
he
watched
in
awe
as
they
swung
into
operation
time
passed
you
know
of
any
ships
supposed
to
be
in
that
sector
he
asked
someone
no
sir
we
were
expecting
any
calls
except
from
lang
on
venus
the
technician
gasped
realizing
he
had
made
a
slip
and
turned
pale
that
all
right
walton
assured
him
i
the
director
remember
i
know
all
about
lang
of
course
sir
here
a
reply
sir
another
of
the
nameless
faceless
technicians
said
walton
scanned
it
it
read
walton
request
further
identification
before
we
report
a
little
shudder
of
satisfaction
shook
walton
at
the
sight
of
the
initialed
at
the
end
of
the
message
that
could
mean
only
mcleod
and
could
mean
only
one
thing
the
experimental
starship
had
returned
walton
realized
depressedly
that
this
probably
implied
that
they
had
found
any
worlds
among
the
stars
mcleod
note
to
fitzmaugham
had
said
they
would
search
for
a
year
and
would
return
home
at
the
end
of
that
time
if
they
had
no
success
and
just
about
a
year
had
elapsed
he
said
send
this
return
message
mcleod
nairobi
congratulations
walton
the
technician
vanished
again
leaving
walton
alone
he
gazed
moodily
at
the
complex
maze
of
equipment
all
around
him
listened
to
the
steady
of
the
communication
devices
strained
his
ears
to
pick
up
fragments
of
conversation
from
the
men
after
what
seemed
like
an
hour
the
technician
returned
there
a
message
coming
through
now
sir
we
decoding
it
as
fast
as
we
can
make
it
snappy
walton
said
his
watch
read
only
twenty
minutes
had
passed
since
he
had
gone
down
there
a
grimy
sheet
of
paper
was
thrust
under
his
nose
he
read
it
walton
this
is
mcleod
happy
to
report
that
experimental
ship
is
returning
home
with
all
hands
in
good
shape
after
a
remarkable
cruise
of
the
galaxy
i
feel
like
ulysses
returning
to
ithaca
except
we
did
have
such
a
hard
time
of
imagine
you
be
interested
in
this
we
found
a
perfectly
lovely
and
livable
world
in
the
procyon
system
no
intelligent
life
at
all
and
incredibly
fine
climate
pity
old
fitzmaugham
have
lived
to
hear
about
it
be
seeing
you
soon
walton
hands
were
still
shaking
as
he
pressed
the
actuator
that
would
let
him
back
into
his
office
he
would
have
to
call
another
meeting
of
the
section
chiefs
again
to
discuss
the
best
method
of
presenting
this
exciting
news
to
the
world
for
one
thing
they
would
have
to
explain
away
fitzmaugham
failure
to
reveal
that
the
had
been
sent
out
over
a
year
ago
that
could
be
easily
handled
then
there
would
have
to
be
a
careful
descriptions
of
the
new
world
profiles
of
the
heroes
who
had
found
it
etcetera
someone
was
going
to
have
to
work
out
a
plan
for
emigration
unless
the
resourceful
fitzmaugham
had
already
drawn
up
such
a
plan
and
stowed
it
in
files
for
just
this
anticipated
day
and
then
perhaps
lamarre
could
be
called
back
now
and
allowed
to
release
his
discovery
plans
buzzed
in
walton
mind
in
the
event
that
people
proved
reluctant
to
leave
earth
and
conquer
an
unknown
world
no
matter
how
tempting
the
climate
it
might
be
feasible
to
dangle
immortality
before
them
to
restrict
lamarre
treatment
to
volunteer
colonists
or
something
along
that
line
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
figure
that
out
walton
thought
he
stepped
into
his
office
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
a
glow
of
pleasure
surrounded
him
for
once
it
seemed
that
things
were
heading
in
the
right
direction
he
was
happy
in
a
way
that
fitzmaugham
was
no
longer
in
charge
now
with
mankind
on
the
threshold
of
walton
blinked
i
leave
that
file
drawer
open
when
i
left
the
office
he
wondered
he
was
usually
more
cautious
than
that
the
file
was
definitely
open
now
as
were
the
two
cabinets
adjoining
it
numbly
he
swung
the
cabinet
doors
wider
peered
into
the
shadows
groped
inside
the
drawers
containing
the
documents
pertaining
to
terraforming
and
to
mcleod
space
drive
seemed
intact
but
the
cabinet
in
which
walton
had
placed
lamarre
portfolio
that
cabinet
was
totally
empty
been
in
he
thought
angrily
and
then
the
anger
changed
to
agony
as
he
remembered
what
had
been
in
lamarre
portfolio
and
what
would
happen
if
that
formula
were
loosed
indiscriminately
in
the
world
ix
the
odd
part
of
it
walton
thought
was
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
he
could
do
he
could
call
sellors
and
give
him
a
roasting
for
not
guarding
his
office
properly
but
that
would
restore
the
missing
portfolio
he
could
send
out
a
general
alarm
and
thereby
let
the
world
know
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
lamarre
formula
that
would
be
catastrophic
walton
slammed
the
cabinet
shut
and
spun
the
lock
then
heavily
he
dropped
into
his
chair
and
rested
his
head
in
his
arms
all
the
jubilation
of
a
few
moments
before
had
suddenly
melted
into
dull
apprehension
suspects
just
two
lamarre
and
fred
lamarre
because
he
was
obvious
fred
because
he
was
likely
to
do
anything
to
hurt
his
brother
give
me
sellors
in
security
walton
said
quietly
sellors
bland
face
appeared
on
the
screen
he
blinked
at
the
sight
of
walton
causing
walton
to
wonder
just
how
ghastly
his
own
appearance
was
even
with
the
executive
filter
touching
up
the
transmitted
image
sprucing
him
up
and
falsifying
him
for
the
public
benefit
he
probably
looked
dreadful
sellors
i
want
you
to
send
out
a
general
order
for
a
lamarre
you
find
his
appearance
recorded
on
the
entrance
tapes
for
today
he
came
to
see
me
earlier
the
first
name
is
ah
elliot
elliot
lamarre
gerontologist
i
do
know
where
he
lives
what
should
i
do
when
i
find
him
sir
bring
him
here
at
once
and
if
you
catch
him
at
home
slap
a
seal
on
his
door
he
may
be
in
possession
of
some
very
important
secret
documents
yes
sir
and
get
hold
of
the
doorsmith
who
repaired
my
office
door
i
want
the
lock
calibration
changed
at
once
certainly
sir
the
screen
faded
walton
turned
back
to
his
desk
and
busied
himself
in
meaningless
paper
work
trying
to
keep
himself
from
thinking
a
few
moments
later
the
screen
brightened
again
it
was
fred
walton
stared
coldly
at
his
brother
image
well
fred
chuckled
why
so
pale
and
wan
dear
brother
disappointed
in
love
what
do
you
want
an
audience
with
his
highness
the
interim
director
if
it
please
his
grace
fred
grinned
unpleasantly
a
private
audience
if
you
please
very
well
come
on
up
here
fred
shook
his
head
sorry
no
go
there
are
too
many
tricky
spy
pickups
in
that
office
of
yours
let
meet
elsewhere
shall
we
where
that
club
you
belong
to
the
bronze
room
walton
sputtered
but
i
ca
leave
the
building
now
there
no
one
who
now
fred
interrupted
the
bronze
room
it
in
the
san
isidro
is
it
top
of
neville
prospect
all
right
said
walton
resignedly
there
a
doorsmith
coming
up
here
to
do
some
work
give
me
a
minute
to
cancel
the
assignment
and
i
meet
you
downstairs
you
leave
now
fred
said
i
arrive
five
minutes
after
you
and
you
wo
need
to
cancel
anything
was
the
doorsmith
neville
prospect
was
the
most
fashionable
avenue
in
all
of
new
york
city
a
wide
strip
of
ferroconcrete
running
up
the
west
side
between
eleventh
avenue
and
the
west
side
drive
from
fortieth
to
fiftieth
street
it
was
bordered
on
both
sides
by
looming
apartment
buildings
in
which
a
man
of
wealth
might
have
as
many
as
four
or
five
rooms
to
his
suite
and
at
the
very
head
of
the
prospect
facing
was
the
mighty
san
isidro
a
buttressed
fortress
of
gleaming
metal
and
stone
whose
mighty
supports
swept
out
in
a
massive
arc
five
hundred
feet
in
either
direction
on
the
hundred
fiftieth
floor
of
the
san
isidro
was
the
exclusive
bronze
room
from
whose
quartz
windows
might
be
seen
all
the
sprawling
busyness
of
manhattan
and
the
confusion
of
new
jersey
just
across
the
river
the
jetcopter
delivered
walton
to
the
of
the
bronze
room
he
tipped
the
man
too
much
and
stepped
within
a
door
of
dull
bronze
confronted
him
he
touched
his
key
to
the
signet
plate
the
door
pivoted
noiselessly
inward
admitting
him
the
color
scheme
today
was
gray
gray
light
streamed
from
the
luminescent
walls
gray
carpets
lay
underfoot
gray
tables
with
gray
dishes
were
visible
in
the
murky
distance
a
waiter
hardly
more
than
four
feet
tall
sidled
up
to
walton
good
to
see
you
again
sir
he
murmured
you
have
not
been
here
of
late
no
walton
said
i
been
busy
a
terrible
tragedy
the
death
of
fitzmaugham
he
was
one
of
our
most
esteemed
members
will
you
have
your
usual
room
today
sir
walton
shook
his
head
i
entertaining
a
guest
my
brother
fred
we
need
a
compartment
for
two
he
identify
himself
when
he
arrives
of
course
come
with
me
please
the
gnome
led
him
through
a
gray
haze
to
another
bronze
door
down
a
corridor
lined
with
antique
works
of
art
through
an
interior
room
decorated
with
glowing
of
remarkable
quality
past
a
broad
quartz
window
so
clean
as
to
be
dizzyingly
invisible
and
up
to
a
narrow
door
with
a
bright
red
signet
plate
in
its
center
for
you
sir
walton
touched
his
key
to
the
signet
plate
the
door
crumpled
like
a
fan
he
stepped
inside
gravely
handed
the
gnome
a
bill
and
closed
the
door
the
room
was
tastefully
furnished
again
in
gray
the
bronze
room
was
always
uniformly
monochromatic
though
the
hue
varied
with
the
day
and
with
the
mood
of
the
city
walton
had
long
speculated
on
what
the
club
precincts
would
be
like
were
the
electronic
magic
disconnected
actually
he
knew
none
of
the
bronze
room
appurtenances
had
any
color
except
when
the
hand
in
the
control
room
threw
the
switch
the
club
held
many
secrets
it
was
fitzmaugham
who
had
brought
about
walton
admission
to
the
club
and
walton
had
been
deeply
grateful
he
was
in
a
room
just
comfortably
large
enough
for
two
with
a
single
bright
window
facing
the
hudson
a
small
onyx
table
a
tiny
screen
tastefully
set
in
the
wall
and
a
bar
he
dialed
himself
a
filtered
rum
his
favorite
drink
the
dark
cloudy
liquid
came
pouring
instantly
from
the
spigot
the
screen
suddenly
flashed
a
wave
of
green
breaking
the
ubiquitous
grayness
the
green
gave
way
to
the
bald
head
and
scowling
face
of
kroll
the
bronze
room
sir
there
is
a
man
outside
who
claims
to
be
your
brother
he
alleges
he
has
an
appointment
with
you
here
that
right
kroll
send
him
in
fulks
will
bring
him
to
my
room
just
one
moment
sir
first
it
is
needful
to
verify
kroll
face
vanished
and
fred
appeared
is
this
the
man
kroll
voice
asked
yes
walton
said
you
can
send
my
brother
in
fred
seemed
a
little
dazed
by
the
opulence
he
sat
gingerly
on
the
edge
of
the
foamweb
couch
obviously
attempting
to
appear
blas√©
and
painfully
conscious
of
his
failure
to
do
so
this
is
quite
a
place
he
said
finally
walton
smiled
a
little
on
the
palatial
side
for
my
tastes
i
come
here
often
the
transition
hurts
too
much
when
i
go
back
outside
fitzmaugham
got
you
in
here
did
he
walton
nodded
i
thought
so
fred
said
well
maybe
someday
soon
i
be
a
member
too
then
we
can
meet
here
more
often
we
do
see
enough
of
each
other
you
know
dial
yourself
a
drink
walton
said
then
tell
me
what
on
your
mind
or
were
you
just
angling
to
get
an
invite
up
here
it
was
more
than
that
but
let
me
get
a
drink
before
we
begin
fred
dialed
a
weesuer
heavy
on
the
absinthe
and
took
a
few
sampling
sips
before
wheeling
around
to
face
walton
he
said
one
of
the
minor
talents
i
acquired
in
the
course
of
my
wanderings
was
doorsmithing
it
really
not
very
difficult
to
learn
for
a
man
who
applies
himself
you
were
the
one
who
repaired
my
office
door
fred
smirked
i
was
i
wore
a
mask
of
course
and
my
uniform
was
borrowed
masks
are
very
handy
things
they
make
them
most
convincingly
nowadays
as
for
instance
the
one
worn
by
the
man
who
posed
as
ludwig
what
do
you
know
about
and
that
the
flat
truth
roy
i
did
kill
fitzmaugham
and
i
do
know
who
did
he
drained
his
drink
and
dialed
another
no
the
old
man
death
is
as
much
of
a
mystery
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
but
i
have
to
thank
you
for
wrecking
the
door
so
completely
when
you
blasted
your
way
in
it
gave
me
a
chance
to
make
some
repairs
when
i
most
wanted
to
walton
held
himself
very
carefully
in
check
he
knew
exactly
what
fred
was
going
to
say
in
the
next
few
minutes
but
he
refused
to
let
himself
precipitate
the
conversation
with
studied
care
he
rose
dialed
another
filtered
rum
for
himself
and
gently
slid
the
initiator
switch
on
the
electroluminescent
kaleidoscope
embedded
in
the
rear
wall
a
pattern
of
lights
sprang
into
being
yellow
pale
rose
blue
soft
green
they
wove
together
intertwined
sprang
apart
into
a
sharp
hexagon
broke
into
a
melted
seemed
to
fall
to
the
carpet
in
bright
flakes
shut
that
thing
off
fred
snapped
suddenly
come
on
shut
it
it
walton
swung
around
his
brother
was
leaning
forward
intently
eyes
clamped
tight
shut
is
it
off
fred
asked
tell
me
shrugging
walton
canceled
the
signal
and
the
lights
faded
you
can
open
your
eyes
now
it
off
cautiously
fred
opened
his
eyes
none
of
your
fancy
tricks
roy
trick
walton
asked
innocently
what
trick
simple
decoration
that
all
and
quite
lovely
too
just
like
the
kaleidowhirls
seen
on
video
fred
shook
his
head
it
not
the
same
thing
how
do
i
know
it
not
some
sort
of
hypnoscreen
how
do
i
know
what
those
lights
can
do
walton
realized
his
brother
was
unfamiliar
with
wall
kaleidoscopes
it
perfectly
harmless
he
said
but
if
you
do
want
it
on
we
can
do
without
it
good
that
the
way
i
like
it
walton
observed
that
fred
cool
confidence
seemed
somewhat
shaken
his
brother
had
made
a
tactical
error
in
insisting
on
holding
their
interview
here
where
walton
had
so
much
the
upper
hand
may
i
ask
again
why
you
wanted
to
see
me
walton
said
there
are
those
people
fred
said
slowly
who
oppose
the
entire
principle
of
population
equalization
i
aware
of
that
some
of
them
are
members
of
this
very
club
exactly
some
of
them
are
the
ones
i
mean
are
the
gentry
those
still
lucky
enough
to
cling
to
land
and
home
the
squire
with
a
hundred
acres
in
the
matto
grosso
the
wealthy
landowner
of
liberia
the
gentleman
who
controls
the
rubber
output
of
one
of
the
lesser
indonesian
islands
these
people
roy
are
unhappy
over
equalization
they
know
that
sooner
or
later
you
and
your
bureau
will
find
out
about
them
and
will
equalize
them
say
by
installing
a
hundred
chinese
on
a
private
estate
or
by
using
a
private
river
for
a
nuclear
turbine
you
have
to
admit
that
their
dislike
of
equalization
is
understandable
everyone
dislike
of
equalization
is
understandable
walton
said
i
dislike
it
myself
you
got
your
evidence
of
that
two
days
ago
no
one
likes
to
give
up
special
privileges
you
see
my
point
then
there
are
perhaps
a
hundred
of
these
men
in
close
contact
with
each
other
ah
yes
fred
said
a
league
a
conspiracy
it
might
almost
be
called
very
very
shady
doings
yes
i
work
for
them
fred
said
walton
let
that
soak
in
you
an
employee
of
popeek
he
said
are
you
inferring
that
you
both
an
employee
of
popeek
and
an
employee
of
a
group
that
seeks
to
undermine
popeek
fred
grinned
proudly
that
the
position
on
the
nose
it
calls
for
remarkable
compartmentalization
of
mind
i
think
i
manage
nicely
incredulously
walton
said
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
ever
since
i
came
to
popeek
this
group
is
older
than
popeek
they
fought
equalization
all
the
way
and
lost
now
they
working
from
the
bottom
up
and
trying
to
wreck
things
before
you
catch
wise
and
confiscate
their
estates
as
you
now
legally
entitled
to
do
and
now
that
you
warned
me
they
exist
walton
said
you
can
be
assured
that
that
the
first
thing
i
do
the
second
thing
i
do
will
be
to
have
the
security
men
track
down
their
names
and
find
out
if
there
was
an
actual
conspiracy
if
there
was
it
jail
for
them
and
the
third
thing
i
do
is
discharge
you
from
popeek
fred
shook
his
head
you
wo
do
any
of
those
things
roy
you
ca
why
i
know
something
about
you
that
would
look
good
if
it
came
out
in
the
open
something
that
would
get
you
bounced
out
of
your
high
position
in
a
flash
not
fast
enough
to
stop
me
from
setting
the
wheels
going
my
successor
would
continue
the
job
of
rooting
out
your
league
of
landed
gentry
i
doubt
that
fred
said
calmly
i
doubt
it
very
much
because
going
to
be
your
successor
x
crosscurrents
of
fear
ran
through
walton
he
said
what
are
you
talking
about
fred
folded
his
arms
complacently
i
do
think
it
comes
as
news
to
you
that
i
broke
into
your
office
this
morning
while
you
were
out
it
was
very
simple
when
i
installed
the
lock
i
built
in
a
canceling
circuit
that
would
let
me
walk
in
whenever
i
pleased
and
this
morning
i
pleased
i
was
hoping
to
find
something
i
could
use
as
immediate
leverage
against
you
but
i
had
expected
anything
as
explosive
as
the
portfolio
in
the
cabinet
where
is
it
fred
grinned
sharply
the
contents
of
that
portfolio
are
now
in
very
safe
keeping
roy
do
bluster
and
do
threaten
because
it
work
i
took
precautions
and
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
what
would
happen
if
that
immortality
serum
got
distributed
to
the
good
old
man
in
the
street
fred
said
for
one
thing
there
be
a
glorious
panic
that
would
solve
your
population
problem
for
a
while
with
millions
killed
in
the
rush
but
after
that
where
would
you
equalize
with
every
man
and
woman
on
earth
living
forever
and
producing
immortal
children
we
do
know
the
effects
yet
do
temporize
you
damned
well
know
it
be
the
biggest
upheaval
the
world
has
ever
seen
fred
paused
my
employers
he
said
are
in
possession
of
the
lamarre
formulas
now
and
with
great
glee
are
busy
making
themselves
immortals
no
they
do
trust
the
stuff
and
wo
use
it
until
it
been
tried
on
two
or
three
billion
guinea
pigs
human
ones
they
not
planning
to
release
the
serum
are
they
walton
gasped
not
immediately
fred
said
in
exchange
for
certain
concessions
on
your
part
they
prepared
to
return
lamarre
portfolio
to
you
without
making
use
of
it
concessions
such
as
what
that
you
refrain
from
declaring
their
private
lands
open
territory
for
equalization
that
you
resign
your
post
as
interim
director
that
you
go
before
the
general
assembly
and
recommend
me
as
your
successor
who
else
is
best
fitted
to
serve
the
interests
i
represent
walton
leaned
back
his
face
showing
a
mirth
he
scarcely
felt
very
neat
fred
but
full
of
holes
first
thing
what
assurance
have
i
that
your
wealthy
friends
wo
keep
a
copy
of
the
lamarre
formula
and
use
it
as
a
bludgeon
in
the
future
against
anyone
they
do
agree
with
none
fred
admitted
naturally
what
more
suppose
i
refuse
to
give
in
and
your
employers
release
the
serum
to
all
and
sundry
who
gets
hurt
not
me
i
live
in
a
box
myself
but
they
be
filling
the
world
with
billions
and
billions
of
people
their
beloved
estates
will
be
overrun
by
the
hungry
multitudes
whether
they
like
it
or
not
and
no
fence
will
keep
out
a
million
hungry
people
this
is
a
risk
they
recognize
fred
said
walton
smiled
triumphantly
you
mean
they
bluffing
they
know
they
do
dare
release
that
serum
and
they
think
they
can
get
me
out
of
the
way
and
you
their
puppet
into
office
by
making
menacing
noises
all
right
i
call
their
bluff
you
mean
you
refuse
yes
walton
said
i
have
no
intention
of
resigning
my
interim
directorship
and
when
the
assembly
convenes
i
going
to
ask
for
the
job
on
a
permanent
basis
they
give
it
to
me
and
my
evidence
against
you
the
prior
baby
hearsay
propaganda
i
laugh
it
right
out
of
sight
try
laughing
off
the
serum
roy
it
wo
be
so
easy
as
all
that
i
manage
walton
said
tightly
he
crossed
the
room
and
jabbed
down
on
the
communicator
stud
the
screen
lit
the
wizened
face
of
the
tiny
servitor
appeared
sir
fulks
would
you
show
this
gentleman
out
of
my
chamber
please
he
has
no
further
wish
to
remain
with
me
right
away
mr
walton
before
you
throw
me
out
fred
said
let
me
tell
you
one
more
thing
go
ahead
you
acting
stupidly
though
that
nothing
new
for
you
roy
give
you
a
week
grace
to
make
up
your
mind
then
the
serum
goes
into
production
my
mind
is
made
up
walton
said
stiffly
the
door
telescoped
and
fulks
stood
outside
he
smiled
obsequiously
at
walton
bowed
to
fred
and
said
to
him
would
you
come
with
me
please
it
was
like
one
of
those
dreams
walton
thought
in
which
you
were
a
butler
bringing
dishes
to
the
table
and
the
tray
becomes
obstinately
stuck
to
your
fingertips
and
refuses
to
be
separated
or
in
which
the
cavendishes
are
dining
in
state
and
you
come
to
the
table
nude
or
in
which
you
float
downward
perpetually
with
never
a
sign
of
bottom
there
never
seemed
to
be
any
way
out
force
opposed
force
and
he
seemed
doomed
always
to
be
caught
in
the
middle
angrily
he
snapped
the
kaleidoscope
back
on
and
let
its
everchanging
swirl
of
color
distract
him
but
in
the
depth
of
the
deepest
violet
he
kept
seeing
his
brother
mocking
face
he
summoned
fulks
the
gnome
looked
up
at
him
expectantly
get
me
a
jetcopter
walton
ordered
i
be
waiting
on
the
west
stage
for
it
very
good
sir
fulks
never
had
any
problems
walton
reflected
sourly
the
little
man
had
found
his
niche
in
life
he
spent
his
days
in
the
plush
comfort
of
the
bronze
room
seeing
to
the
wants
of
the
members
never
any
choices
to
make
never
any
of
the
agonizing
decisions
that
complicated
life
decisions
walton
realized
that
one
particular
decision
had
been
made
for
him
that
of
seeking
the
directorship
permanently
he
had
not
been
planning
to
do
that
now
he
had
no
choice
but
to
remain
in
office
as
long
as
he
could
he
stepped
out
onto
the
landing
stage
and
into
the
waiting
jetcopter
cullen
building
he
told
the
robopilot
abstractedly
he
did
not
feel
very
cheerful
the
annunciator
panel
in
walton
office
was
bright
as
a
christmas
tree
the
signal
bulbs
were
all
alight
each
representing
someone
anxious
to
speak
to
him
he
flipped
over
the
indicating
he
was
back
in
his
office
and
received
the
first
call
it
was
from
lee
percy
percy
thick
features
were
wrinkled
into
a
smile
just
heard
that
speech
you
made
outside
the
building
this
morning
roy
it
getting
a
big
blare
on
the
newsscreens
beautiful
simply
beautiful
could
have
been
better
if
we
concocted
it
ourselves
glad
you
like
it
walton
said
it
really
was
off
the
cuff
even
better
then
you
positively
a
genius
say
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that

yours
blasted

a
single
day
send

a
transcript
of
my
speech
before

air
walton
said
i
want
to
read
and
approve
that
thing
if
it
supposed
to
be
coming
out
of
my
mouth
it
a
natural
roy

have
to
worry

walton
snapped
okay

ears

to
you
posthaste
man
ease
up
pop
a
pill
you
are
loose
roy
i
ca
afford
to
be
walton
said
he
broke
contact
and
almost
instantly
the
next
call
blossomed
on
the
screen
walton
recognized
the
man
as
one
of
the
technicians
from
communications
floor
well
we
heard
from
mcleod
again
sir
message
came
in
half
an
hour
ago
and
we
been
trying
to
reach
you
ever
since
i
was
in
give
me
the
message
the
technician
unfolded
a
slip
of
paper
it
says
nairobi

be
in
new
york
by
morning
mcleod
good
send
him
confirmation
and
tell
him
i
keep
the
entire
morning
free
to
see
him
yes
sir
oh
anything
from
venus
the
technician
shook
his
head
emphatically
not
a
peep
we
ca
make
contact
with
lang
at
all
walton
frowned
he
wondered
what
was
happening
to
the
terraforming
crew
up
there
keep
trying
will
you
work
a
schedule
draw
extra
pay
but
get
in
touch
with
lang
dammit
sir
anything
else
no
get
off
the
line
as
the
contact
snapped
walton
smoothly
broke
connection
again
leaving
ten
more
callers
sputtering
a
row
of
lights
a
foot
long
indicated
their
presence
on
the
line
walton
ignored
them
and
turned
instead
to
his
newsscreen
the
news
was
on
he
fiddled
with
the
controls
and
saw
his
own
face
take
form
on
the
screen
he
was
standing
outside
the
cullen
building
looking
right
out
of
the
screen
at
himself
and
in
the
background
could
be
seen
a
huddled
form
under
a
coat
the
dead
herschelite
walton
of
the
screen
was
saying
the
man
was
asking
for
trouble
popeek
represents
the
minds
and
hearts
of
the
world
herschel
and
his
people
seek
to
overthrow
this
order
i
ca
condone
violence
of
any
sort
naturally
but
popeek
is
a
sacred
responsibility
to
me
its
enemies
i
must
regard
as
blind
and
misguided
people
he
was
smiling
into
the
camera
but
there
was
something
behind
the
smile
something
cold
and
steely
that
astonished
the
watching
walton
he
thought
that
genuine
have
i
really
grown
so
hard
apparently
he
had
he
watched
himself
turn
majestically
and
stride
into
the
cullen
building
stronghold
of
popeek
there
was
definitely
a
commanding
air
about
him
the
commentator
was
saying
with
those
heartfelt
words
director
walton
goes
to
his
desk
in
the
cullen
building
to
carry
out
his
weighty
task
to
bring
life
out
of
death
joy
out
of
sadness
this
is
the
job
facing
popeek
and
this
is
the
sort
of
man
to
whom
it
has
been
entrusted
roy
walton
we
salute
you
the
screen
panned
to
a
still
of
director
fitzmaugham
meanwhile
the
commentator
went
on
walton
predecessor
the
late
fitzmaugham
went
to
his
rest
today
police
are
still
hoping
to
uncover
the
group
responsible
for
his
brutal
slaying
and
report
a
good
probability
of
success
tonight
all
channels
will
carry
a
memorial
program
for
this
great
leader
of
humanity
fitzmaugham
hail
and
farewell
a
little
sickened
walton
snapped
the
set
off
he
had
to
admire
lee
percy
the
propaganda
man
had
done
his
job
well
with
a
minor
assist
from
walton
by
way
of
a
spontaneous
speech
percy
had
contrived
to
gain
vast
quantities
of
precious
air
time
for
popeek
all
to
the
good
the
annunciator
was
still
blinking
violently
it
seemed
about
to
explode
with
the
weight
of
frustrated
calls
walton
nudged
a
red
stud
at
the
top
and
security
chief
sellors
entered
the
screen
sellors
sir
we
been
looking
for
this
lamarre
ca
find
him
anywhere
what
we
checked
him
to
his
home
he
got
there
all
right
then
he
disappeared
no
sign
of
him
anywhere
in
the

walton
blanked
the
screen
and
avoided
the
next
caller
he
called
his
secretary
and
said
will
you
instruct
everyone
now
calling
me
to
refer
their
business
downstairs

administrator

then
he
added
oh

me
through
to
eglin
myself
before
you
let
any
of
those
calls
reach
him
eglin
face
appeared
on
the
private
screen
that
linked
the
two
offices
the
small
man
looked
and
harried
this
is
a
hell
of
a
job
roy
he
sighed
so
is
mine
walton
said

got
a
ton
of
calls

the
wire
and
i
transferring
them
all
down
to

walton
asked
lassen
i
sent
his
dossier
to

hours
ago
have
read
it
yet
is
he
on
the
job
already
sure

there
since
i
moved
up
here
eglin
said
what
never
mind
said
walton
he
hung
up
and
called
lassen
the
new
director
of
field
agents
lassen
was
a
young
man
with
stiff
sandy
hair
and
a
sternly
efficient
manner
walton
said
lassen
i
want
you
to
do
a
job
for
me
get
one
of
your
men
to
make
up
a
list
of
the
hundred
biggest
private
estates
still
unequalized
i
want
the
names
of
their
owners
location
of
the
estates
acreage
and
things
like
that
got
it
right
when
will
you
want
it
mr
walton
immediately
but
i
do
want
it
to
be
a
sloppy
job
this
is
top
important
double
lassen
nodded
walton
grinned
at
him
the
boy
seemed
to
be
in
good
control
of
himself
and
clicked
off
he
realized
that
he
been
engaged
in
half
a
dozen
conversations
without
a
break
over
a
span
of
perhaps
twenty
minutes
his
heart
was
pounding
his
feet
felt
numb
he
popped
a
benzolurethrin
into
his
mouth
and
kept
on
going
he
would
need
to
act
fast
now
that
the
wheels
were
turning
mcleod
arriving
the
next
day
to
report
the
results
of
the
expedition
lamarre
missing
fred
at
large
and
working
for
a
conspiracy
of
landowners
walton
foresaw
that
he
would
be
on
a
steady
diet
of
tranquilizers
for
the
next
few
days
he
opened
the
arrival
bin
and
pulled
out
a
handful
of
paper
one
thick
bundle
was
the
dossier
on
lassen
walton
initialed
it
and
tossed
it
unread
into
the
files
chute
he
would
have
to
rely
on
judgement
lassen
seemed
competent
enough
underneath
that
he
found
the
script
of
the
fitzmaugham
memorial
program
to
be
shown
that
evening
walton
sat
back
and
started
to
skim
through
it
it
was
the
usual
sort
of
eulogy
he
skipped
rapidly
past
life
and
great
works
on
to
the
part
where
interim
director
walton
appeared
on
the
screen
to
speak
this
part
he
read
more
carefully
he
was
very
much
interested
in
the
words
that
percy
had
placed
in
his
mouth
xi
the
speech
that
night
went
over
well
almost
walton
watched
the
program
in
the
privacy
of
his
home
sprawled
out
on
the
foamweb
sofa
with
a
drink
in
one
hand
and
the
text
of
in
the
other
the
giant
screen
that
occupied
nearly
half
of
his
one
unbroken
wall
glowed
in
lifelike
colors
fitzmaugham
career
was
traced
with
pomp
and
circumstance
done
up
in
full
glory
plenty
of
ringing
trumpet
flourishes
dozens
of
color
groupings
much
tense
narrative
percy
had
done
his
job
skillfully
the
show
was
punctuated
by
quotations
from
fitzmaugham
classic
book
space
and
key
government
figures
drifted
in
and
out
of
the
narrative
webwork
orating
sonorously
that
pious
fraud
seymour
lanson
president
of
the
united
states
delivered
a
flowery
speech
the
old
figurehead
was
an
artist
at
his
one
function
speechmaking
walton
watched
spellbound
lee
percy
was
a
genius
in
his
field
there
was
no
denying
that
finally
toward
the
end
of
the
hour
the
narrator
said
the
work
of
popeek
goes
on
though
its
creator
lies
dead
at
an
assassin
hand
director
fitzmaugham
had
chosen
as
his
successor
a
young
man
schooled
in
the
ideals
of
popeek
roy
walton
we
know
will
continue
the
noble
task
begun
by
f
fitzmaugham
for
the
second
time
that
day
walton
watched
his
own
face
appear
on
a
video
screen
he
glanced
down
at
the
script
in
his
hand
and
back
up
at
the
screen
percy
technicians
had
done
a
brilliant
job
the
on
the
screen
looked
so
real
that
the
walton
on
the
couch
almost
believed
he
had
actually
delivered
this
speech
although
he
knew
it
had
been
cooked
up
out
of
some
rearranged
stills
and
a
few
brokendown
phonemes
with
his
voice
characteristics
it
was
a
perfectly
innocent
speech
in
humble
tones
he
expressed
his
veneration
for
the
late
director
his
hopes
that
he
would
be
able
to
fill
the
void
left
by
the
death
of
fitzmaugham
his
sense
of
popeek
as
a
sacred
trust
walton
began
to
skim
the
script
startled
walton
looked
down
at
the
script
he
did
remember
having
encountered
any
such
lines
on
his
first
reading
and
he
could
find
them
now
this
morning
the
on
the
screen
went
on
we
received
from
outer
from
a
ship
sent
out
over
a
year
ago
to
explore
our
neighboring
stars
news
of
this
voyage
has
been
withheld
until
now
for
security
reasons
but
it
is
my
great
pleasure
to
tell
you
tonight
that
the
stars
have
at
last
been
reached
by
man
a
new
world
waits
for
us
out
there
lush
fertile
ready
to
be
colonized
by
the
brave
pioneers
of
tomorrow
walton
stared
aghast
at
the
screen
his
simulacrum
had
returned
now
to
the
script
as
prepared
but
he
barely
listened
he
was
thinking
that
percy
had
let
the
cat
out
for
sure
it
was
a
totally
unauthorized
newsbreak
numbly
walton
watched
the
program
come
to
its
end
and
wondered
what
the
repercussions
would
be
once
the
public
grasped
all
the
implications
he
was
awakened
at
by
the
chiming
of
his
phone
grumpily
he
climbed
from
bed
snapped
on
the
receiver
switched
the
cutoff
on
the
picture
sender
in
order
to
hide
his
appearance
and
said
this
is
walton
yes
a
picture
formed
on
the
screen
a
man
in
his
late
forties
stocky
hair
close
cropped
sorry
to
roust
you
this
way
old
man
i
mcleod
walton
came
fully
awake
in
an
instant
mcleod
where
are
you
out
on
long
island
i
just
pulled
into
the
airport
half
a
moment
ago
traveled
all
night
after
dumping
the
ship
at
nairobi
you
made
a
good
landing
i
hope
the
best
the
ship
navigates
like
a
bubble
mcleod
frowned
worriedly
they
brought
me
the
telefax
while
i
was
having
breakfast
i
could
help
reading
all
about
the
speech
you
made
last
night
oh
i
quite
a
crasher
of
a
speech
mcleod
went
on
evenly
but
do
you
think
it
was
a
little
premature
of
you
to
release
word
of
my
flight
i
mean
it
was
quite
premature
walton
said
a
member
of
my
staff
inserted
that
statement
into
my
talk
without
my
knowledge
he
be
disciplined
for
it
a
puzzled
frown
appeared
on
mcleod
face
but
made
that
speech
with
your
own
lips
how
can
you
blame
it
on
a
member
of
your
staff
the
science
that
can
send
a
ship
to
procyon
and
back
within
a
year
walton
said
can
also
fake
a
speech
but
i
imagine
we
be
able
to
cover
up
the
without
too
much
trouble
i
not
so
sure
of
that
said
mcleod
he
shrugged
apologetically
you
see
that
planet
there
all
right
but
it
happens
to
be
the
property
of
alien
beings
who
live
in
the
next
world
and
they
not
so
happy
about
having
earth
come
crashing
into
their
system
to
colonize
somehow
walton
managed
to
hang
onto
his
even
with
this
staggering
news
crashing
about
him
you
been
in
contact
with
these
beings
he
asked
mcleod
nodded
they
have
a
translating
gadget
we
met
them
yes
walton
moistened
his
lips
i
think
there
going
to
be
trouble
he
said
i
think
i
may
be
out
of
a
job
too
what
that
just
thinking
out
loud
walton
said
finish
your
breakfast
and
meet
me
at
my
office
at
we
talk
this
thing
out
then
walton
was
in
full
command
of
himself
by
the
time
he
reached
the
cullen
building
he
had
read
the
morning
telefax
and
heard
the
newsblares
they
all
screamed
the
sum
and
essence
of
walton
speech
of
the
previous
night
and
a
few
of
the
braver
telefax
outfits
went
as
far
as
printing
a
resum√©
of
the
entire
speech
boiled
down
to
basic
of
course
for
benefit
of
that
substantial
segment
of
the
reading
public
that
was
most
comfortable
while
moving
its
lips
the
one
telefax
outfit
most
outspokenly
opposed
to
popeek
took
great
delight
in
giving
the
speech
full
play
and
editorializing
on
a
subsequent
sheet
against
the
veil
of
security
hazing
popeek
operations
walton
read
the
editorial
twice
savoring
its
painstaking
simplicities
of
expression
then
he
clipped
it
out
neatly
and
shot
it
down
the
chute
to
public
relations
marked
lee
there
a
mcleod
waiting
to
see
you
his
secretary
informed
him
he
says
he
has
an
appointment
send
him
in
walton
said
and
have
percy
come
up
here
also
while
he
waited
for
mcleod
to
arrive
walton
riffled
through
the
rest
of
the
telefax
sheets
some
of
them
praised
popeek
for
having
uncovered
a
new
world
others
damned
them
for
having
hidden
news
of
the
drive
so
long
walton
stacked
them
neatly
in
a
heap
at
the
edge
of
his
desk
in
the
bleak
dark
hours
of
the
morning
he
had
expected
to
be
compelled
to
resign
now
he
realized
he
could
immeasurably
strengthen
his
own
position
if
he
could
control
the
flow
of
events
and
channel
them
properly
the
square
figure
of
mcleod
appeared
on
the
screen
walton
admitted
him
sir
i
mcleod
of
course
wo
you
sit
down
mcleod
was
tense
stiffly
formal
very
british
in
his
reserve
and
general
bearing
walton
gestured
uneasily
trying
to
cut
through
the
crackle
of
nervousness
we
seem
to
have
a
mess
on
our
hands
he
said
but
there
no
mess
so
messy
we
ca
muddle
through
it
eh
if
we
have
to
sir
but
i
ca
help
feeling
this
could
all
have
been
avoided
no
you
wrong
mcleod
if
it
have
been
avoided
it
would
have
been
avoided
the
fact
that
some
idiot
in
my
public
relations
department
gained
access
to
my
wire
and
found
out
you
were
returning
is
incontrovertible
it
happened
despite
precautions
percy
to
see
you
the
annunciator
said
the
angular
figure
of
lee
percy
appeared
on
the
screen
walton
told
him
to
come
in
percy
looked
frightened
terrified
walton
thought
he
held
a
folded
slip
of
paper
loosely
in
one
hand
good
morning
sir
good
morning
lee
walton
observed
that
the
friendly
had
changed
to
the
formal
salutation
did
you
get
the
clipping
i
sent
you
yes
sir
glumly
lee
this
is
leslie
mcleod
chief
of
operations
of
our
successful
project
colonel
mcleod
i
want
you
to
meet
lee
percy
he
the
man
who
masterminded
our
little
newsbreak
last
night
percy
flinched
visibly
he
stepped
forward
and
laid
his
slip
of
paper
on
walton
desk
i
a
last
night
he
stammered
i
should
never
have
released
that
break
damned
right
you
should
have
walton
agreed
carefully
keeping
any
hint
of
severity
from
his
voice
you
have
us
in
considerable
hot
water
lee
that
planet
is
ours
for
colonization
despite
the
enthusiasm
with
which
i
allegedly
announced
it
last
night
and
you
ought
to
be
clever
enough
to
realize
it
impossible
to
withdraw
and
deny
good
news
once
you
broken
it
the
planet
not
ours
but
according
to
colonel
mcleod
walton
said
the
planet
is
the
property
of
intelligent
alien
beings
who
live
on
a
neighboring
world
and
who
no
more
care
to
have
their
system
overrun
by
a
pack
of
earthmen
than
we
would
to
have
extrasolar
aliens
settle
on
mars
sir
that
sheet
of
paper
percy
said
in
a
choked
voice
it
it
walton
unfolded
it
it
was
percy
resignation
he
read
the
note
carefully
twice
smiled
and
laid
it
down
now
was
his
time
to
be
magnanimous
denied
he
said
we
need
you
on
our
team
lee
i
authorizing
a
ten
percent
for
one
week
effective
yesterday
but
there
be
no
other
penalty
thank
you
sir
crawling
to
walton
thought
in
amazement
he
said
only
do
pull
that
stunt
again
or
i
not
only
fire
you
but
blacklist
you
so
hard
you
wo
be
able
to
find
work
between
here
and
procyon
understand
yes
sir
okay
go
back
to
your
office
and
get
to
work
and
no
more
publicity
on
this
thing
until
i
authorize
it
no
cancel
that
get
out
a
quick
release
a
followup
on
last
night
a
smoke
screen
i
mean
cook
up
so
much
cloudy
verbiage
about
the
conquest
of
space
that
no
one
bothers
to
remember
anything
of
what
i
said
and
play
down
the
colonization
angle
i
get
it
sir
percy
grinned
feebly
i
doubt
that
walton
snapped
when
you
have
the
release
prepared
shoot
it
up
here
for
my
okay
and
heaven
help
you
if
you
deviate
from
the
text
i
see
by
as
much
as
a
single
comma
percy
practically
backed
out
of
the
office
why
did
you
do
that
mcleod
asked
puzzled
you
mean
why
did
i
let
him
off
so
lightly
mcleod
nodded
in
the
military
he
said
we
have
a
man
shot
for
doing
a
thing
like
that
this
is
the
military
walton
said
and
even
though
the
man
behaved
like
a
congenital
idiot
yesterday
that
not
enough
evidence
to
push
him
into
happysleep
besides
he
knows
his
stuff
i
afford
to
discharge
him
are
public
relations
men
that
hard
to
come
by
no
but
he
a
good
one
and
the
prospect
of
having
him
desert
to
the
other
side
frightens
me
he
be
forever
grateful
to
me
now
if
i
had
fired
him
he
would
had
half
a
dozen
articles
in
the
before
the
week
was
out
and
they
ruin
us
mcleod
smiled
appreciatively
you
handle
your
job
well
mr
walton
i
have
to
walton
said
the
director
of
popeek
is
paid
to
produce
two
or
three
miracles
per
hour
one
gets
used
to
it
after
a
while
tell
me
about
these
aliens
colonel
mcleod
mcleod
swung
a
briefcase
to
walton
desk
and
flipped
the
magneseal
he
handed
walton
a
thick
sheaf
of
glossy
color
photos
the
first
dozen
or
so
are
scenes
of
the
planet
mcleod
explained
it
procyon
viii
number
eight
out
of
sixteen
unless
we
missed
a
couple
we
checked
sixteen
worlds
in
the
system
anyway
ten
of
were
methane
giants
we
did
even
bother
to
land
two
were
ammonia
supergiants
even
less
pleasant
three
small
ones
had
no
atmosphere
at
all
worth
speaking
about
and
were
no
more
livable
looking
than
mercury
and
the
remaining
one
was
the
one
we
call
new
earth
take
a
look
sir
walton
looked
the
photos
showed
rolling
hills
covered
with
shrubbery
flowing
rivers
a
lovely
sunrise
several
of
the
shots
were
of
indigenous
life
a
wizened
little
monkey
a
doglike
thing
a
toothy
bird
life
runs
to
six
limbs
there
walton
observed
but
how
livable
can
this
place
be
unless
your
photos
are
sour
that
grass
is
and
the
water
peculiar
looking
too
what
sort
of
tests
did
you
run
it
the
light
sir
procyon
a
double
star
that
faint
companion
gets
up
in
the
sky
and
does
tricky
things
to
the
camera
that
grass
may
look
blue
but
it
a
photosynthesizer
all
the
same
and
the
water
nothing
but
o
even
with
that
purple
tinge
walton
nodded
how
about
the
atmosphere
we
were
breathing
it
for
a
week
and
no
trouble
it
pretty
rich
in
oxygen
percent
gives
you
a
bouncy
feeling
just
right
for
pioneers
i
say
you
prepared
a
full
report
on
this
place
have
you
of
course
it
right
here
mcleod
started
to
reach
for
his
briefcase
not
just
yet
walton
said
i
want
to
go
through
the
rest
of
these
snapshots
he
turned
over
one
after
another
rapidly
until
he
came
to
a
photo
that
showed
a
strange
blocky
figure
bright
green
in
color
its
neckless
head
was
encased
in
a
sort
of
breathing
mask
fashioned
from
some
transparent
plastic
three
cold
brooding
eyes
peered
outward
what
this
walton
asked
oh
that
mcleod
attempted
a
cheerful
grin
that
a
dirnan
they
live
on
procyon
ix
one
of
the
planets
they
the
aliens
who
do
want
us
there
xii
walton
stared
at
the
photograph
of
the
alien
there
was
intelligence
there
yes
intelligence
and
understanding
and
perhaps
even
a
sort
of
compassion
he
sighed
there
were
always
qualifications
never
unalloyed
successes
colonel
mcleod
how
long
would
it
take
your
ship
to
return
to
the
procyon
system
he
asked
thoughtfully
mcleod
considered
the
question
hardly
any
time
sir
a
few
days
maybe
why
just
a
wild
idea
tell
me
about
your
contact
with
these
ah
dirnans
well
sir
they
landed
after
we
spent
more
than
a
week
surveying
new
earth
there
were
six
of
them
and
they
had
their
translating
widget
with
them
they
told
us
who
they
were
and
wanted
to
know
who
we
were
we
told
them
they
said
they
ran
the
procyon
system
and
were
of
a
mind
to
let
any
alien
beings
come
barging
in
did
they
sound
hostile
walton
asked
oh
no
just
businesslike
we
were
trespassing
and
they
asked
us
to
get
off
they
were
cold
about
it
but
not
angry
fine
walton
said
look
here
now
do
you
think
you
could
go
back
to
their
world
as
well
as
an
ambassador
from
earth
bring
one
of
the
dirnans
here
for
treaty
talks
and
such
i
suppose
so
mcleod
said
hesitantly
if
it
necessary
it
looks
as
if
it
may
be
you
had
no
luck
in
any
of
the
other
nearby
systems
no
then
procyon
viii
our
main
hope
tell
your
men
we
offer
double
pay
for
this
cruise
and
make
it
as
fast
as
you
know
how
hyperspace
travel
practically
instantaneous
mcleod
said
we
spent
most
of
our
time
cruising
on
standard
ion
drive
from
planet
to
planet
maneuvering
in
the
subspace
manifold
a
snap
though
good
snap
it
up
then
back
to
nairobi
and
clear
out
of
there
as
soon
as
you
ready
remember
it
urgent
you
bring
one
of
the
aliens
here
for
treaty
talks
i
do
my
best
mcleod
said
walton
stared
at
the
empty
seat
where
mcleod
had
been
and
tried
to
picture
a
green
dirnan
sitting
there
goggling
at
him
with
its
three
eyes
he
was
beginning
to
feel
like
a
juggler
popeek
activity
proceeded
on
so
many
fronts
at
once
that
it
quite
dazzled
him
and
every
hour
there
were
new
challenges
to
meet
new
decisions
to
make
at
the
moment
there
were
too
many
eggs
and
not
enough
baskets
walton
realized
he
was
making
the
same
mistake
fitzmaugham
had
that
of
carrying
too
much
of
the
popeek
workings
inside
his
skull
if
anything
happened
to
him
the
operation
would
be
fatally
paralyzed
and
it
would
be
some
time
before
the
gears
were
meshing
again
he
resolved
to
keep
a
journal
to
record
each
day
a
full
and
mercilessly
honest
account
of
each
of
the
many
maneuvers
in
which
he
was
engaged
he
would
begin
with
his
private
conflict
with
fred
and
the
interests
fred
represented
follow
through
with
the
episode
and
include
a
detailed
report
on
the
problems
of
the
subsidiary
projects
new
earth
and
lang
terraforming
group
that
gave
him
another
idea
reaching
for
his
voicewrite
he
dictated
a
concise
confidential
memorandum
instructing
assistant
administrator
eglin
to
outfit
an
investigatory
mission
immediately
purpose
to
go
to
venus
and
make
contact
with
lang
the
terraforming
group
was
nearly
two
weeks
overdue
in
its
scheduled
report
he
could
not
ignore
them
any
longer
the
everlasting
annunciator
chimed
and
walton
switched
on
the
screen
it
was
sellors
and
from
the
look
of
abject
terror
on
the
man
face
walton
knew
that
something
sticky
had
just
transpired
what
is
it
sellors
any
luck
in
tracing
lamarre
none
sir
the
security
chief
said
but
there
been
another
development
walton
a
most
serious
one
serious
walton
was
ready
to
expect
anything
a
bulletin
announcing
the
end
of
the
universe
perhaps
well
tell
me
about
it
he
snapped
impatiently
sellors
seemed
about
ready
to
collapse
with
shame
he
said
hesitantly
one
of
the
communications
technicians
was
making
a
routine
check
of
the
building
circuits
walton
he
found
one
that
did
seem
to
belong
where
it
was
so
he
checked
up
and
found
out
that
it
had
been
newly
installed
well
what
of
it
it
was
a
spy
pickup
with
its
outlet
in
your
office
sir
sellors
said
letting
the
words
tumble
out
in
one
blur
all
the
time
you
were
talking
this
morning
someone
was
spying
on
you
walton
grabbed
the
arms
of
his
chair
are
you
telling
me
that
your
department
was
blind
enough
to
let
someone
pipe
a
spy
pickup
right
into
this
office
he
demanded
where
did
this
outlet
go
and
is
it
cut
off
they
cut
it
off
as
soon
as
they
found
it
sir
it
went
to
a
lavatory
on
the
floor
and
how
long
was
it
in
operation
at
least
since
last
night
sir
communications
assures
me
that
it
could
possibly
have
been
there
before
yesterday
afternoon
since
they
ran
a
general
check
then
and
did
see
it
walton
groaned
it
was
small
comfort
to
know
that
he
had
had
privacy
up
till
last
evening
if
the
wrong
people
had
listened
in
on
his
conversation
with
mcleod
there
would
be
serious
trouble
all
right
sellors
this
thing
ca
be
your
fault
but
keep
your
eyes
peeled
in
the
future
and
tell
communications
that
my
office
is
to
be
checked
for
such
things
twice
a
day
from
now
on
at
and
at
yes
sir
sellors
looked
tremendously
relieved
and
start
interrogating
the
communications
technicians
find
out
responsible
for
that
spy
circuit
and
hold
him
on
security
charges
and
locate
lamarre
i
do
my
best
mr
walton
while
the
screen
was
clearing
walton
jotted
down
a
memorandum
to
himself
so
far
as
security
chief
sellors
had
allowed
an
assassin
to
reach
fitzmaugham
allowed
prior
to
burst
into
walton
old
office
permitted
fred
to
masquerade
as
a
doorsmith
long
enough
to
gain
access
to
walton
private
files
and
stood
by
blindly
while
lee
percy
tapped
into
walton
private
wire
and
some
unidentified
technician
strung
a
spy
pickup
into
the
director
supposedly
sacred
office
no
security
chief
could
have
been
as
incompetent
as
all
that
it
had
to
be
a
planned
campaign
directed
from
the
outside
he
dialed
eglin
olaf
you
get
my
message
about
the
venus
rescue
mission
okay
came
through
a
few
minutes
ago
i
have
the
specs
drawn
up
by
tonight
devil
with
that
walton
said
drop
everything
and
send
that
ship
out
i
got
to
know
what
lang
and
his
crew
are
up
to
and
i
have
to
know
right
away
if
we
do
produce
a
livable
venus
or
at
least
the
possibility
of
one
in
a
couple
of
days
we
be
in
for
it
on
all
sides
why
what
up
you
see
keep
an
eye
on
the
telefax
i
bet
the
next
edition
of
is
going
to
be
interesting
it
was
the
glossy
sheets
of
the
extruded
themselves
from
a
million
receivers
in
the
new
york
area
but
none
of
those
million
copies
was
as
avidly
pounced
on
as
was
director
walton
he
had
been
hovering
near
the
wall
outlet
for
ten
minutes
avidly
awaiting
the
sheet
arrival
and
he
was
not
disappointed
the
streamer
headline
ran
from
space
nix
big
popeek
and
under
it
in
smaller
type
uglies
put
feet
in
director
walton
big
he
smiled
grimly
and
went
on
to
the
story
itself
written
in
the
best
approved
journalese
it
read
human
beings
we
been
suckered
again
citizen
out
for
sure
this
morning
that
the
big
surprise
popeek
interim
director
walton
yanked
out
of
his
hat
last
night
has
a
hole
in
sure
dope
that
there
a
good
planet
up
there
in
the
sky
for
grabs
the
way
we
hear
it
it
just
like
earth
only
prettier
with
trees
and
flowers
remember
them
our
man
says
the
air
there
is
nice
and
clean
this
world
sounds
what
walton
did
know
last
night
came
home
to
roost
today
seems
the
folks
on
the
next
planet
out
there
do
want
any
sloppy
old
earthmen
messing
up
their
pasture
and
so
we
ai
going
to
have
any
new
earth
after
all
walton
is
a
cinch
to
throw
in
the
towel
dope
in
later
editions
and
check
the
edit
page
for
extra
it
was
obvious
walton
thought
that
the
spy
pickup
which
had
been
planted
in
his
office
had
been
a
direct
pipe
line
to
the
news
desk
they
had
taken
his
conversation
with
mcleod
and
carefully
ground
it
down
into
the
chatty
informal
colloquial
style
that
made
the
world
most
telefax
service
he
shuddered
at
what
might
have
happened
if
they
had
their
spy
pickup
installed
a
day
earlier
and
overheard
walton
in
the
process
of
suppressing
lamarre
immortality
serum
there
would
have
been
a
lynch
mob
storming
the
cullen
building
ten
minutes
after
the
hit
the
waves
with
its
expos√©
not
that
he
was
much
better
off
now
he
no
longer
had
the
advantage
of
secrecy
to
cloak
his
actions
and
public
officials
who
were
compelled
to
conduct
business
in
the
harsh
light
of
public
scrutiny
generally
did
hold
their
offices
for
long
he
turned
the
sheet
over
and
searched
for
the
editorial
column
merely
to
confirm
his
expectations
it
was
captioned
in
bold
black
we
patsies
for
greenskins
and
went
on
to
say
beings
have
said
whoa
to
our
plans
for
opening
up
a
new
world
in
space
these
aliens
have
put
thumbs
down
on
colonization
of
the
new
earth
discovered
by
colonel
leslie
from
the
question
of
why
popeek
kept
word
of
the
mcleod
expedition
from
the
public
so
long
there
is
this
to
consider
will
we
take
this
lying
down
got
to
find
space
for
us
to
live
new
earth
is
a
good
place
the
answer
to
the
trouble
is
easy
we
take
new
earth
if
the
greenskins
do
like
it
bounce
about
it
what
do
we
do
walton
we
want
to
know
what
goes
it
was
an
open
exhortation
to
interstellar
warfare
dispiritedly
walton
let
the
telefax
sheets
skitter
to
the
floor
and
made
no
move
to
pick
them
up
war
with
the
dirnans
if
had
its
way
there
would
be
the
telefax
sheet
would
remorselessly
stir
the
people
up
until
the
cry
for
war
was
unanimous
thought
walton
callously
good
war
would
reduce
the
population
surplus
the
idiots
he
caught
the
afternoon
newsblares
they
were
full
of
the
break
and
one
commentator
made
a
demand
that
walton
either
advocate
war
with
the
dirnans
or
resign
not
long
afterward
un
delegate
ludwig
called
some
hot
action
over
here
today
he
told
walton
after
that
thing
got
out
a
few
of
the
oriental
delegates
started
howling
for
your
scalp
on
sixteen
different
counts
of
bungling
going
on
walton
plenty
of
spy
activity
for
one
thing
the
main
problem
though
is
the
nucleus
of
incompetent
assistants
surrounding
me
i
think
i
going
to
reduce
the
local
population
personally
before
the
day
is
out
with
a
blunt
instrument
preferably
is
there
any
truth
in
the
story
hell
yes
walton
exclaimed
for
once
it
gospel
an
enterprising
telefax
man
rigged
a
private
pipe
line
into
my
office
last
night
and
no
one
caught
it
until
it
was
too
late
sure
those
aliens
are
holding
out
they
do
want
us
coming
in
there
ludwig
chewed
at
his
lip
you
have
any
plans
dozens
of
them
want
some
cheap
he
laughed
a
brittle
unamused
laugh
seriously
roy
you
ought
to
go
on
the
air
again
and
smooth
this
thing
over
the
people
are
yelling
for
war
with
these
dirnans
and
half
of
us
over
here
at
the
un
are
even
sure
the
damned
creatures
exist
could
you
fake
it
up
a
little
no
walton
said
there
been
enough
faking
i
going
on
the
air
with
the
truth
for
a
change
better
have
all
your
delegates
over
there
listening
in
because
their
ears
are
in
for
an
opening
as
soon
as
he
was
rid
of
ludwig
he
called
lee
percy
that
program
on
the
conquest
of
space
is
almost
ready
to
go
the
public
relations
man
informed
him
kill
it
have
you
seen
the
noon
no
been
too
busy
on
the
new
program
anything
big
walton
chuckled
fairly
big
the
just
yanked
the
rug
out
from
under
everything
we
probably
be
at
war
with
procyon
ix
by
sundown
i
want
you
to
buy
me
air
space
on
every
medium
for
the
spot
tonight
sure
thing
what
kind
of
speech
you
want
us
to
cook
up
none
at
all
walton
said
i
going
to
speak
off
the
cuff
for
a
change
just
buy
the
time
for
me
and
squeeze
the
budget
for
all
worth
xiii
the
bright
light
of
the
video
cameras
flooded
the
room
percy
had
done
a
good
job
there
was
a
representative
from
every
network
every
telefax
every
blare
of
any
sort
at
all
the
media
had
been
corralled
walton
words
would
echo
round
the
world
he
was
seated
behind
his
desk
seated
because
he
could
shape
his
words
more
forcefully
that
way
and
also
because
he
was
terribly
tired
he
smiled
into
the
battery
of
cameras
good
evening
he
said
i
roy
walton
speaking
to
you
from
the
offices
of
the
bureau
of
population
equalization
i
been
director
of
popeek
for
a
little
less
than
a
week
now
and
i
like
to
make
a
report
a
progress
report
so
to
speak
we
of
popeek
regard
ourselves
as
holding
a
mandate
from
you
the
people
after
all
it
was
the
referendum
last
year
that
enabled
the
united
nations
to
put
us
into
business
and
i
want
to
tell
you
how
the
work
of
popeek
is
going
our
aim
is
to
provide
breathing
space
for
human
beings
the
world
is
vastly
overcrowded
with
its
seven
billion
people
popeek
job
is
to
ease
that
overcrowdedness
to
equalize
the
population
masses
of
the
world
so
that
the
empty
portions
of
the
globe
are
filled
up
and
the
extremely
overcrowded
places
thinned
out
a
little
but
this
is
only
part
of
our
job
the
temporary
part
we
planning
for
the
future
here
we
know
we
ca
keep
shifting
population
from
place
to
place
on
earth
it
wo
work
forever
eventually
every
square
inch
is
going
to
be
covered
and
then
where
do
we
go
you
know
the
answer
we
go
we
reach
for
the
stars
at
present
we
have
spaceships
that
can
take
us
to
the
planets
but
the
planets
are
suitable
for
human
life
all
right
we
them
suitable
at
this
very
moment
a
team
of
engineers
is
on
venus
in
that
hot
dry

atmosphere
struggling
to
turn
venus
into
a
world
fit
for
human
beings
they
do
it
too
and
when
done
with
venus
they
move
on
to
mars
to
the
moon
perhaps
to
the
big
satellites
of
jupiter
and
saturn
too
there
be
a
day
when
the
solar
system
will
be
habitable
from
mercury
to
pluto
we
hope
but
even
that
is
walton
said
pointedly
there
be
a
day
it
may
be
a
hundred
years
from
now
or
a
thousand
or
ten
thousand
when
the
entire
solar
system
will
be
as
crowded
with
humanity
as
earth
is
today
we
have
to
plan
for
that
day
too
it
the
of
planning
on
the
part
of
our
ancestors
that
made
things
so
hard
for
us
we
of
popeek
do
want
to
repeat
the
tragic
mistakes
of
the
past
my
predecessor
the
late
director
fitzmaugham
was
aware
of
this
problem
he
succeeded
in
gathering
a
group
of
scientists
and
technicians
who
developed
a
super
space
drive
a
ship
that
can
travel
to
the
stars
virtually
instantaneously
instead
of
taking
years
to
make
the
trip
as
our
present
ships
would
the
ship
was
built
and
sent
out
on
an
exploratory
mission
director
fitzmaugham
chose
to
keep
this
fact
a
secret
he
was
afraid
of
arousing
false
hopes
in
case
the
expedition
should
be
a
failure
the
expedition
was
a
failure
colonel
leslie
mcleod
and
his
men
discovered
a
planet
similar
to
earth
in
the
system
of
the
star
procyon
i
have
seen
photographs
of
new
earth
as
they
have
named
it
and
i
can
tell
you
that
it
is
a
lovely
planet
and
one
that
will
be
receptive
to
our
pioneers
walton
paused
a
moment
before
launching
into
the
main
subject
of
his
talk
unfortunately
there
is
a
race
of
intelligent
beings
living
on
a
neighboring
planet
of
this
world
perhaps
you
have
seen
the
misleading
and
inaccurate
reports
blared
today
to
the
effect
that
these
people
refuse
to
allow
earth
to
colonize
in
their
system
some
of
you
have
cried
out
for
immediate
war
against
these
people
the
dirnans
i
must
confirm
part
of
the
story
the
telefax
carried
today
the
dirnans
are
definitely
not
anxious
to
have
earth
set
up
a
colony
on
a
world
adjoining
theirs
we
are
strangers
to
them
and
their
reaction
is
understandable
after
all
suppose
a
race
of
creatures
landed
on
mars
and
proceeded
with
wholesale
colonization
of
our
neighboring
world
we
be
uneasy
to
say
the
least
and
so
the
dirnans
are
uneasy
however
i
summoned
a
dirnan
ambassador
our
first
diplomatic
contact
with
intelligent
alien
creatures
and
i
hope
he
be
on
earth
shortly
i
plan
to
convince
him
that
we
peaceful
neighborly
people
and
that
it
will
be
to
our
mutual
benefit
to
allow
earth
colonization
in
the
procyon
system
i
going
to
need
your
help
if
while
our
alien
guest
is
here
he
discovers
that
some
misguided
earthmen
are
demanding
war
with
dirna
he
certainly
not
going
to
think
of
us
as
particularly
desirable
neighbors
to
welcome
with
open
arms
i
want
to
stress
the
importance
of
this
sure
we
can
go
to
war
with
dirna
for
possession
of
procyon
viii
but
why
spread
wholesale
destruction
on
two
worlds
when
we
can
probably
achieve
our
goal
peacefully
that
all
i
have
to
say
tonight
people
of
the
world
i
hope
think
about
what
i
told
you
popeek
works
hours
a
day
in
your
behalf
but
we
need
your
full
cooperation
if
we
going
to
achieve
our
aims
and
bring
humanity
to
its
full
maturity
thank
you
the
floodlights
winked
out
suddenly
leaving
walton
momentarily
blinded
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
he
saw
the
cameramen
moving
their
bulky
apparatus
out
of
the
office
quickly
and
efficiently
the
regular
programs
had
returned
to
the
channels
the
vapid
dancing
and
the
terror
shows
the
kaleidowhirls
now
that
it
was
over
now
that
the
tension
was
broken
walton
experienced
a
moment
of
bitter
disillusionment
he
had
had
high
hopes
for
his
speech
but
had
he
really
put
it
over
he
was
sure
he
glanced
up
lee
percy
stood
over
him
roy
can
i
say
something
percy
said
diffidently
go
ahead
walton
said
i
do
know
how
many
millions
i
forked
over
to
put
you
on
the
media
tonight
but
i
know
one
thing
we
threw
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
money
away
walton
sighed
wearily
why
do
you
say
that
that
speech
of
yours
percy
said
was
the
speech
of
an
amateur
you
ought
to
let
pros
handle
the
big
spiels
roy
i
thought
you
liked
the
impromptu
thing
i
did
when
they
mobbed
that
herschelite
how
come
no
go
tonight
percy
shook
his
head
the
speech
you
made
outside
the
building
was
different
it
had
emotion
it
had
punch
but
tonight
you
did
come
across
at
all
no
i
put
money
behind
it
acidly
percy
said
you
ca
win
the
public
opinion
by
being
reasonable
you
gave
a
nice
smooth
speech
bland
folksy
you
laid
everything
on
the
line
where
they
could
see
it
and
that
wrong
is
it
walton
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
because
they
wo
listen
you
gave
them
a
sermon
when
you
should
have
been
punching
at
them
sweet
reason
you
ca
be
if
you
want
to
sell
your
product
to
seven
billion
morons
is
that
all
they
are
walton
asked
just
morons
percy
chuckled
in
the
long
run
yes
give
them
their
daily
bread
and
their
one
room
to
live
in
and
they
wo
give
a
damn
what
happens
to
the
world
fitzmaugham
sold
them
popeek
the
way
you
sell
a
car
without
turbines
he
hoodwinked
them
into
buying
something
they
thought
about
or
wanted
they
popeek
whether
they
wanted
it
or
not
no
one
needs
a
car
without
turbines
bad
analogy
then
percy
said
but
it
true
they
do
care
a
blast
about
popeek
except
where
it
affects
them
if
you
told
them
that
these
aliens
would
kill
them
all
if
they
did
act
nice
have
gotten
across
but
this
sweetness
and
light
business
oh
no
roy
it
just
does
work
is
that
all
you
have
to
tell
me
walton
asked
i
guess
so
i
just
wanted
to
show
you
where
you
had
a
big
chance
and
muffed
it
where
we
could
have
helped
you
out
if
you
let
us
i
want
you
to
think
i
being
rude
or
critical
roy
i
just
trying
to
be
helpful
okay
lee
get
out
huh
go
away
go
sell
ice
to
the
eskimos
leave
me
alone
yes
if
that
the
way
you
want
it
hell
roy
do
brood
over
it
we
can
still
fix
things
up
before
that
alien
gets
here
we
can
put
the
content
of
tonight
speech
across
so
smoothly
that
they
wo
even
know
we
out
percy
skittered
for
the
door
he
paused
and
said
you
all
wrought
up
roy
you
ought
to
take
a
pill
or
something
for
your
nerves
well
he
had
his
answer
an
expert
evaluation
of
the
content
and
effect
of
his
speech
dammit
he
had
to
reach
them
percy
said
he
had
and
percy
probably
was
right
little
as
walton
cared
to
admit
the
fact
to
himself
but
was
percy
approach
the
only
one
did
you
have
to
lie
to
them
push
them
treat
them
as
seven
billion
morons
maybe
right
now
billions
of
human
beings
the
same
human
beings
walton
was
expending
so
much
energy
to
save
were
staring
at
the
kaleidowhirl
programs
on
their
videos
their
eyes
were
getting
fixed
glassy
their
mouths
were
beginning
to
sag
open
their
cheeks
to
wobble
their
lips
to
droop
pendulously
as
the
hypnosis
of
the
color
patterns
took
effect
this
was
humanity
they
were
busy
forgetting
all
the
things
they
had
just
been
forced
to
listen
to
all
the
big
words
like
and
and
just
so
many
harsh
syllables
to
be
wiped
away
by
the
soothing
swirl
of
the
colors
and
somewhere
else
possibly
a
poet
named
prior
was
listening
to
his
baby
coughing
and
trying
to
write
a
poem
a
poem
that
walton
and
a
few
others
would
read
excitedly
while
the
billions
would
ignore
it
walton
saw
that
percy
was
dead
right
roy
walton
could
never
have
sold
popeek
to
the
world
but
fitzmaugham
that
cagy
devious
genius
did
it
by
waving
his
hands
before
the
public
and
saying
abracadabra
he
bamboozled
them
into
approving
popeek
before
they
knew
what
they
were
being
sold
it
was
a
lousy
trick
but
fitzmaugham
had
realized
that
it
had
to
be
done
someone
had
killed
him
for
it
but
it
was
too
late
by
then
and
walton
saw
that
he
had
taken
the
wrong
track
by
trying
to
be
reasonable
percy
callous
description
of
humanity
as
seven
billion
morons
was
uncomfortably
close
to
the
truth
walton
would
have
to
make
his
appeal
to
a
more
subliminal
level
perhaps
he
thought
at
the
level
of
the
kaleidowhirls
those
endless
patterns
of
colored
light
that
were
the
main
form
of
diversion
for
the
great
unwashed
get
to
walton
promised
himself
ca
be
any
dignity
or
nobility
in
human
life
with
everyone
crammed
into
one
sardine
can
so
i
treat
them
like
the
sardines
they
are
and
hope
i
can
turn
them
into
the
human
beings
they
could
be
if
they
only
had
he
rose
turned
out
the
light
prepared
to
leave
he
wondered
if
the
late
director
fitzmaugham
had
ever
faced
an
internal
crisis
of
this
sort
or
whether
fitzmaugham
had
known
these
truths
innately
from
the
start
probably
the
latter
was
the
case
fitzmaugham
had
been
a
genius
a
sort
of
superman
but
fitzmaugham
was
dead
and
the
man
who
carried
on
his
work
was
no
genius
he
was
only
a
mere
man
the
reports
started
filtering
in
the
next
morning
it
went
much
as
percy
had
predicted
was
the
most
virulent
under
the
sprawling
headline
kidding
who
the
telefax
sheet
wanted
to
know
what
the
popeek
director
was
trying
to
tell
the
world
on
all
media
the
night
before
they
were
sure
since
walton
according
to
had
been
talking
in
hifalutin
prose
picked
on
purpose
to
befuddle
john
q
public
but
their
general
impression
was
that
walton
had
proposed
some
sort
of
sellout
to
the
dirnans
the
sellout
idea
prevailed
in
most
of
the
cheap
telefax
sheets
behind
a
cloud
of
words
popeek
czar
walton
is
selling
the
world
downstream
to
the
greenskins
said
one
paper
his
talk
last
night
was
strictly
bunk
his
words
and
grim
face
were
supposed
to
put
over
something
but
we
ai
fooled
and
do
you
be
fooled
either
friend
the
video
commentators
were
a
little
kinder
but
not
very
one
called
for
a
full
investigation
of
the
situation
another
wanted
to
know
why
walton
an
appointed
official
and
not
even
a
permanent
one
at
that
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
handle
such
negotiations
the
un
seemed
a
little
worried
about
that
even
though
ludwig
had
made
a
passionate
speech
insisting
that
negotiations
with
dirna
were
part
of
walton
allotted
responsibilities
that
touched
off
a
new
ruckus
how
much
power
does
walton
have
demanded
in
a
later
edition
is
he
the
boss
of
the
world
and
if
he
is
who
the
devil
is
he
anyway
that
struck
walton
harder
than
all
the
other
blows
he
had
been
gradually
realizing
that
he
did
in
fact
control
what
amounted
to
dictatorial
powers
over
the
world
but
he
had
not
yet
fully
admitted
it
to
himself
and
it
hurt
to
be
accused
of
it
publicly
one
thing
was
clear
his
attempt
at
sincerity
and
clarity
had
been
a
total
failure
the
world
was
accustomed
to
subterfuge
and
verbal
pyrotechnics
and
when
it
did
get
the
expected
commodity
it
grew
suspicious
sincerity
had
no
market
value
by
going
before
the
public
and
making
a
direct
appeal
walton
had
aroused
the
suspicion
that
he
had
something
hidden
up
his
sleeve
when
third
edition
of
the
day
openly
screamed
for
war
with
dirna
walton
realized
the
time
had
come
to
stop
playing
it
clean
from
now
on
he
would
chart
his
course
and
head
there
at
any
cost
he
tore
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
memo
pad
and
inscribed
on
it
a
brief
motto
ends
justify
the
means
with
that
as
his
guide
he
was
ready
to
get
down
to
work
xiv
martinez
security
head
for
the
entire
appalachia
district
was
a
small
slight
man
with
unruly
hair
and
deep
piercing
eyes
he
stared
levelly
at
walton
and
said
sellors
has
been
with
security
for
twenty
years
it
absurd
to
suggest
that
he
disloyal
he
made
a
great
many
mistakes
walton
remarked
i
simply
suggesting
that
if
he
not
utterly
incompetent
he
must
be
in
someone
else
pay
and
you
want
us
to
break
a
man
on
your
director
walton
martinez
shook
his
head
fussily
i
afraid
i
ca
see
that
of
course
if
you
willing
to
go
through
the
usual
channels
you
could
conceivably
request
a
change
of
personnel
in
this
district
but
i
see
how
else
sellors
will
have
to
go
walton
said
our
operation
has
sprung
too
many
leaks
we
need
a
new
man
in
here
at
once
and
i
want
you
to
him
personally
martinez
rose
the
little
man
nostrils
flickered
ominously
i
refuse
security
is
external
to
whims
and
fancies
if
i
remove
sellors
it
will
undermine
security
all
throughout
the
country
all
right
sighed
walton
sellors
stays
i
file
a
request
to
have
him
transferred
though
i
pigeonhole
it
i
can
vouch
for
sellors
competence
myself
martinez
snapped
popeek
is
in
good
hands
walton
please
believe
that
martinez
left
walton
glowered
at
the
retreating
figure
he
knew
martinez
was
honest
but
the
security
head
was
a
stubborn
man
and
rather
than
admit
the
existence
of
a
flaw
in
the
security
structure
he
had
erected
martinez
would
let
a
weak
man
continue
in
a
vital
position
well
that
blind
spot
in
martinez
makeup
would
have
to
be
compensated
for
walton
thought
one
way
or
another
he
would
have
to
get
rid
of
sellors
and
replace
him
with
a
security
man
he
could
trust
he
scribbled
a
hasty
note
and
sent
it
down
the
chute
to
lee
percy
as
walton
anticipated
the
public
relations
man
phoned
minutes
later
roy
what
this
release
you
want
me
to
get
out
fantastic
sellors
a
spy
how
he
has
even
been
arrested
i
just
saw
him
in
the
building
walton
smirked
since
when
do
you
have
such
a
high
respect
for
accuracy
he
asked
send
out
the
release
and
we
watch
what
happens
the
newsblares
were
the
first
to
carry
the
news
walton
listened
cheerlessly
as
they
revealed
that
security
chief
sellors
had
been
arrested
on
charges
of
disloyalty
according
to
informed
sources
said
the
blares
sellors
was
now
in
custody
and
had
agreed
to
reveal
the
nature
of
the
secret
conspiracy
which
had
hired
him
at
came
a
later
report
security
chief
sellors
had
temporarily
been
released
from
custody
and
at
came
a
still
later
report
security
chief
sellors
had
been
assassinated
by
an
unknown
hand
outside
the
cullen
building
walton
listened
to
the
reports
with
cold
detachment
he
had
foreseen
the
move
sellors
panicky
employers
had
silenced
the
man
for
good
ends
justify
the
walton
told
himself
there
was
no
reason
to
feel
pity
for
sellors
he
had
been
a
spy
and
death
was
the
penalty
it
made
no
real
difference
whether
death
came
in
a
federal
gas
chamber
or
as
the
result
of
some
carefully
faked
news
releases
martinez
called
almost
immediately
after
word
of
sellors
murder
reached
the
blares
the
little
man
face
was
deadly
pale
i
owe
you
an
apology
he
said
i
acted
like
an
idiot
this
morning
do
blame
yourself
walton
said
it
was
only
natural
that
trust
sellors
you
known
him
so
long
but
you
ca
trust
anyone
these
days
martinez
not
even
yourself
i
will
have
to
resign
the
security
man
said
no
it
was
your
fault
sellors
was
a
spy
and
a
bungler
and
he
paid
the
price
his
own
men
struck
him
down
when
that
rumor
escaped
that
he
was
going
to
inform
just
send
me
a
new
man
as
i
asked
and
make
him
a
good
one
keeler
the
new
security
attach√©
was
a
man
in
his
early
thirties
he
reported
directly
to
walton
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
building
you
sellors
replacement
eh
glad
to
see
you
keeler
walton
studied
him
he
looked
tough
and
hard
and
thoroughly
incorruptible
i
a
couple
of
jobs
i
like
you
to
start
on
right
away
first
you
know
sellors
was
looking
for
a
man
named
lamarre
let
me
fill
you
in
on
that
and
no
need
for
that
keeler
said
i
was
the
man
sellors
put
on
the
lamarre
chase
there
is
a
trace
of
him
anywhere
we
got
feelers
out
all
over
the
planet
now
and
no
luck
hmm
walton
was
mildly
annoyed
he
had
been
wishfully
hoping
sellors
had
found
lamarre
and
had
simply
covered
up
the
fact
but
if
keeler
had
been
the
one
who
handled
the
search
there
was
no
hope
of
that
all
right
walton
said
keep
on
the
hunt
for
lamarre
at
the
moment
i
want
you
to
give
this
building
a
thorough
scouring
there
no
telling
how
many
spy
pickups
sellors
planted
here
top
to
bottom
and
report
back
to
me
when
the
job
is
done
next
on
walton
schedule
was
a
call
from
communications
he
received
it
and
a
technician
told
him
there
been
a
call
from
the
venus
ship
do
you
want
it
sir
of
course
it
says
venus
june
fifteen
late
no
sign
of
lang
outfit
yet
well
keep
looking
and
will
report
daily
it
signed
okay
walton
said
thanks
and
if
any
further
word
from
them
comes
let
me
have
it
right
away
the
fate
of
the
lang
expedition
walton
reflected
was
not
of
immediate
importance
but
he
would
like
to
know
what
had
happened
to
the
group
he
hoped
spencer
and
his
rescue
mission
had
something
more
concrete
to
report
tomorrow
the
annunciator
chimed
frederic
walton
is
on
the
line
sir
he
says
it
urgent
okay
walton
said
he
switched
over
and
waited
for
his
brother
face
to
appear
on
the
screen
a
nervous
current
of
anticipation
throbbed
in
him
well
fred
he
asked
at
length
you
been
a
busy
little
bee
have
you
fred
said
i
understand
you
have
a
new
security
chief
to
watch
over
you
i
do
have
time
to
make
conversation
now
walton
snapped
nor
do
i
you
fooled
us
badly
with
that
newsbreak
on
sellors
you
forced
us
into
wiping
out
a
useful
contact
prematurely
not
so
useful
walton
said
i
was
on
to
him
if
you
had
killed
him
i
would
have
had
to
handle
the
job
myself
you
saved
me
the
trouble
my
my
getting
ruthless
are
we
when
the
occasion
demands
walton
said
fair
enough
we
play
the
same
way
fred
eyes
narrowed
you
recall
our
conversation
in
the
bronze
room
the
other
day
roy
vividly
i
called
to
ask
for
your
decision
fred
said
one
way
or
the
other
walton
was
caught
off
guard
but
you
said
i
had
a
week
grace
the
period
has
been
halved
fred
said
we
now
see
it
necessary
to
accelerate
things
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
do
then
i
give
you
my
answer
it
simple
enough
you
to
resign
in
my
favor
if
it
not
done
by
nightfall
tomorrow
we
find
it
necessary
to
release
the
lamarre
serum
those
are
our
terms
and
do
try
to
bargain
with
me
walton
was
silent
for
a
moment
contemplating
his
brother
cold
face
on
the
screen
finally
he
said
it
takes
time
to
get
such
things
done
i
ca
just
resign
overnight
fitzmaugham
did
ah
yes
if
you
call
that
a
resignation
but
unless
you
want
to
inherit
the
same
sort
of
chaos
i
did
you
better
give
me
a
little
time
to
prepare
things
fred
eyes
gleamed
does
that
mean
you
yield
you
resign
in
my
favor
there
no
guarantee
the
un
will
accept
you
walton
warned
even
with
my
recommendation
i
ca
promise
a
one
hundred
percent
chance
of
success
we
have
to
risk
it
said
fred
the
important
step
is
getting
you
out
of
there
when
can
i
have
confirmation
of
all
this
walton
eyed
his
brother
shrewdly
come
up
to
my
office
tomorrow
at
this
time
i
have
everything
set
up
for
you
by
then
and
i
be
able
to
show
you
how
the
popeek
machinery
works
that
one
advantage
you
have
over
me
fitzmaugham
kept
half
the
workings
in
his
head
fred
grinned
savagely
i
see
you
then
roy
chuckling
he
added
i
knew
all
that
ruthlessness
of
yours
was
just
skin
deep
you
never
were
tough
roy
walton
glanced
at
his
watch
after
fred
had
left
the
screen
the
time
was
it
had
been
a
busy
morning
but
some
of
the
vaguenesses
were
beginning
to
look
sharper
he
knew
for
instance
that
sellors
had
been
in
the
pay
of
the
same
organization
that
backed
fred
presumably
this
meant
that
fitzmaugham
had
been
assassinated
by
the
landed
gentry
but
for
what
reason
surely
not
simply
for
the
sake
of
assassination
had
they
cared
to
they
might
have
killed
fitzmaugham
whenever
they
pleased
he
saw
now
why
the
assassination
had
been
timed
as
it
had
by
the
time
the
conspirators
had
realized
that
walton
was
sure
to
be
the
old
successor
fred
had
already
joined
their
group
they
had
ready
leverage
on
the
prospective
director
they
knew
they
could
shove
him
out
of
office
almost
as
quickly
as
he
got
in
and
supplant
him
with
their
puppet
fred
well
they
were
in
for
a
surprise
fred
was
due
to
appear
at
office
at
on
the
morning
of
the
seventeenth
to
take
over
command
walton
planned
to
be
ready
for
them
by
then
there
was
the
matter
of
lamarre
walton
wanted
the
little
scientist
and
his
formula
badly
but
by
this
time
fred
had
certainly
made
at
least
one
copy
of
lamarre
documents
the
threat
would
remain
whether
or
not
popeek
recovered
the
originals
walton
had
hours
to
act
he
called
up
sue
llewellyn
popeek
comptroller
sue
how
our
budget
looking
what
on
your
mind
roy
plenty
i
want
to
know
if
i
can
make
an
expenditure
of
say
a
billion
between
now
and
nightfall
a
you
joking
roy
hardly
walton
tone
was
grim
i
hope
i
wo
need
it
all
but
there
a
big
purchase
i
want
to
make
an
investment
can
you
squeeze
out
the
money
it
does
matter
where
you
squeeze
it
from
either
because
if
we
do
get
it
by
nightfall
there
probably
wo
be
a
popeek
by
the
day
after
tomorrow
what
you
talking
about
roy
give
me
a
yes
or
no
answer
and
if
the
answer
not
the
one
i
want
to
hear
i
afraid
you
can
start
looking
for
a
new
job
sue
she
uttered
a
little
gasp
then
she
said
okay
roy
i
play
along
with
you
even
if
it
bankrupts
us
there
a
billion
at
your
disposal
as
of
now
though
lord
knows
what
i
use
for
a
payroll
next
week
you
have
it
back
walton
promised
with
compound
interest
his
next
call
was
to
a
man
he
had
once
dealt
with
in
his
capacity
of
secretary
to
senator
fitzmaugham
he
was
noel
hervey
a
registered
securities
and
exchange
slyster
hervey
was
a
small
little
man
but
his
unflickering
eyes
belied
his
ratty
appearance
what
troubles
you
roy
i
want
you
to
make
a
stock
purchase
for
me
pronto
within
an
hour
say
hervey
shook
his
head
instantly
sorry
roy
i
all
tied
up
on
a
hefty
monorail
deal
wo
be
free
until
wednesday
or
thursday
if
by
then
walton
said
what
sort
of
money
will
you
be
making
on
this
big
deal
of
yours
noel
confidential
you
would
invade
a
man
privacy
on
a
delicate
matter
like
will
it
be
worth
five
million
dollars
for
you
noel
five
million
hey
is
this
a
gag
i
awfully
serious
walton
said
i
want
you
to
swing
a
deal
for
me
right
away
you
heard
my
price
hervey
smiled
warmly
well
start
talking
friend
consider
me
hired
a
few
other
matters
remained
to
be
tended
to
hurriedly
walton
spent
some
moments
talking
to
a
communications
technician
then
sent
out
an
order
for
three
or
four
technical
books
kaleidowhirl
and
related
works
he
sent
a
note
to
lee
percy
requesting
him
to
stop
by
and
see
him
in
an
hour
and
told
his
annunciator
that
for
no
reason
whatsoever
was
he
to
be
disturbed
for
the
next
sixty
minutes
the
hour
passed
rapidly
by
its
end
walton
head
was
slightly
dizzy
from
too
much
skimming
but
his
mind
was
thrumming
with
new
possibilities
with
communications
potentials
galore
talk
about
reaching
people
he
had
a
natural
he
flipped
on
the
annunciator
is
percy
here
yet
no
sir
should
i
send
for
him
yes
he
due
here
any
minute
to
see
me
have
there
been
any
calls
quite
a
few
i
relayed
them
down
to
eglin
office
as
instructed
good
girl
walton
said
oh
percy
here
and
there
a
call
for
you
from
communications
walton
frowned
tell
percy
to
wait
outside
a
minute
or
two
give
me
the
call
the
communications
tech
on
the
screen
was
grinning
excitedly
he
said
subspace
message
just
came
in
for
you
sir
from
venus
no
sir
from
colonel
mcleod
let
have
it
walton
said
the
technician
read
walton
from
mcleod
via
subspace
radio
have
made
successful
voyage
to
procyon
system
and
am
on
way
back
with
dirnan
ambassador
on
board
see
you
soon
and
good
luck
you
need
it
good
that
all
that
all
sir
okay
keep
me
posted
he
broke
contact
and
turned
to
the
annunciator
excitement
put
a
faint
quiver
in
his
voice
you
can
send
in
percy
now
he
said
xv
walton
looked
up
at
the
public
relations
man
and
said
how
much
do
you
know
about
kaleidowhirls
lee
not
a
hell
of
a
lot
i
never
watch
the
things
myself
they
bad
for
the
eyes
walton
smiled
that
makes
you
a
nonconformist
does
it
according
to
the
figures
i
have
here
the
nightly
kaleidowhirl
programs
are
on
the
rating
charts
maybe
so
percy
said
cautiously
i
still
do
like
to
watch
them
what
goes
roy
i
suddenly
become
very
interested
in
kaleidowhirls
myself
walton
said
he
leaned
back
and
added
casually
i
think
they
can
be
used
as
propaganda
devices
my
brother
reaction
to
one
gave
me
the
idea
couple
days
ago
at
the
bronze
room
for
the
past
hour
or
so
i
been
studying
kaleidowhirls
in
terms
of
information
theory
did
you
know
that
it
possible
to
get
messages
across
via
kaleidowhirl
of
course
percy
gasped
but
the
communications
commission
would
never
let
you
get
away
with
it
by
the
time
the
communications
commission
found
out
what
had
been
done
walton
said
calmly
we
would
be
doing
it
any
more
they
wo
be
able
to
prove
a
thing
sarcastically
he
added
after
spending
a
lifetime
in
public
relations
you
not
suddenly
getting
a
rush
of
ethics
are
you
well
let
have
the
details
then
simple
enough
walton
said
we
feed
through
a
verbal
message
something
like
for
or
do
want
war
with
we
flash
it
on
the
screen
for
say
a
microsecond
then
cover
it
up
with
kaleidowhirl
patterns
wait
two
minutes
then
flash
it
again
plenty
of
noise
but
the
signal
will
get
through
if
we
flash
it
often
enough
and
it
get
through
deep
down
percy
said
subliminally
they
wo
even
realize
that
they
being
indoctrinated
but
suddenly
they
have
a
new
set
of
opinions
about
popeek
and
dirna
he
shuddered
roy
i
hate
to
think
what
can
happen
if
someone
else
gets
to
thinking
about
this
and
puts
on
his
own
kaleidowhirl
show
i
thought
of
that
after
the
dirna
crisis
is
over
after
we
put
over
our
point
i
going
to
take
steps
to
make
sure
no
one
can
use
this
sort
of
weapon
again
i
going
to
frame
someone
into
putting
on
a
propaganda
kaleidowhirl
and
then
catch
him
in
the
act
that
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
wise
up
the
communications
commission
in
other
words
percy
said
you
willing
to
use
this
technique
but
since
you
do
want
anyone
else
to
use
it
you
willing
to
give
up
future
use
of
it
yourself
as
soon
as
the
dirna
trouble
is
over
exactly
walton
shoved
the
stack
of
textbooks
over
to
the
pr
man
read
these
through
first
get
yourself
familiar
with
the
setup
then
buy
a
kaleidowhirl
hour
and
get
a
bunch
of
our
engineers
in
there
to
handle
the
special
inserts
okay
it
nasty
but
i
like
it
when
do
you
want
the
program
to
begin
tomorrow
tonight
if
you
can
work
it
and
set
up
a
poll
of
some
kind
to
keep
check
on
the
program
effectiveness
i
want
two
messages
kaleidowhirled
alternately
one
supporting
popeek
one
demanding
a
peaceful
settlement
with
the
aliens
have
your
pulse
takers
feel
out
the
populace
on
those
two
propositions
and
report
any
fluctuation
to
me
immediately
got
it
oh
one
more
thing
i
suspect
you
have
some
extra
responsibilities
as
of
tomorrow
lee
eh
your
office
will
have
one
additional
medium
to
deal
with
telefax
buying
and
we
going
to
turn
it
into
a
rag
percy
mouth
dropped
in
astonishment
then
he
started
to
laugh
you
a
wonder
roy
a
genuine
wonder
moments
after
percy
departed
noel
hervey
the
security
and
exchange
slyster
called
well
walton
asked
hervey
looked
preoccupied
i
successfully
spent
a
couple
of
hundred
million
of
popeek
money
in
the
last
roy
you
now
own
the
single
biggest
block
of
stock
there
is
how
much
is
that
one
hundred
thousand
shares
approximately
percent
percent
what
about
the
other
eighteen
percent
patience
lad
patience
i
know
my
job
i
snapped
up
all
the
small
holdings
there
were
very
quietly
it
cost
me
a
pretty
penny
to
farm
out
the
purchases
too
why
you
do
that
walton
asked
because
this
has
to
be
handled
very
gingerly
you
know
the
ownership
setup
of
no
well
it
goes
like
this
amalgamated
telefax
owns
a
percent
chunk
and
horace
murlin
owns
percent
since
murlin
also
owns
amalgamated
he
votes
percent
of
the
stock
even
though
it
is
registered
that
way
the
other
percent
matter
murlin
figures
so
i
busy
gathering
up
as
much
of
it
as
i
can
for
you
under
half
a
dozen
different
brokerage
names
i
doubt
that
i
can
get
it
all
but
i
figure
on
rounding
up
at
least
percent
then
i
approach
murlin
with
a
big
deal
and
sucker
him
into
selling
me
six
percent
of
his
stock
he
check
around
find
out
that
the
remaining
stock
is
splintered
different
ways
and
he
probably
let
go
of
a
little
of
his
figuring
he
still
has
control
suppose
he
does
walton
asked
do
worry
hervey
said
confidently
he
will
i
got
a
billion
smackers
to
play
with
do
i
i
cook
up
a
deal
so
juicy
he
resist
it
and
all
he
have
to
do
to
take
a
flyer
will
be
to
peel
off
a
little
of
his
stock
the
second
he
does
that
i
transfer
all
the
fragmented
stock
to
you
with
your
controlling
majority
of
percent
you
boot
murlin
off
the
board
and
the
telefax
sheet
is
yours
simple
clear
perfectly
walton
said
okay
keep
in
touch
he
broke
contact
and
walked
to
the
window
the
street
was
packed
with
people
scrambling
in
every
direction
like
so
many
ants
moving
at
random
over
the
ground
many
of
them
clutched
telefax
sheets
and
the
most
popular
one
was
the
many
of
them
would
gape
and
goggle
at
kaleidowhirl
programs
come
evening
walton
suddenly
tightened
his
fist
in
just
that
way
he
thought
popeek
was
tightening
its
hold
on
the
public
by
capturing
the
mass
media
if
hervey
confidence
had
any
justification
in
truth
they
would
own
the
leading
telefax
sheet
by
tomorrow
with
subtle
handling
over
the
course
of
several
days
they
could
swing
the
slant
of
around
to
a
stand
and
do
it
so
surreptitiously
that
it
would
seem
as
though
the
sheet
had
never
had
any
other
policy
as
for
the
kaleidowhirl
subterfuge
that
walton
admitted
was
hitting
below
the
belt
but
he
had
resolved
that
all
would
be
fair
during
the
current
crisis
there
would
be
time
enough
for
morality
after
war
had
been
averted
at
about
that
day
walton
took
advantage
of
a
lull
in
activities
to
have
a
late
lunch
at
the
bronze
room
he
felt
that
he
had
to
get
away
from
the
confining
walls
of
his
office
for
at
least
some
part
of
the
afternoon
the
bronze
room
had
adopted
cerise
as
its
color
scheme
for
the
day
walton
selected
a
private
room
lunched
lightly
on
baked
chlorella
steak
and
filtered
rum
and
dialed
a
nap
when
the
alarm
system
in
the
foamweb
couch
stirred
him
to
wakefulness
he
stretched
happily
some
of
the
choking
tension
having
been
washed
out
of
him
thoughtfully
he
switched
on
the
electroluminescent
kaleidoscope
and
stared
at
it
it
worked
on
the
same
principle
as
the
kaleidowhirl
programs
beamed
over
the
public
video
except
that
the
bronze
room
provided
beaming
of
its
own
kaleidoscopic
patterns
tending
more
to
soft
greens
and
pale
rose
they
were
on
a
higher
esthetic
plane
certainly
than
the
jagged
melodramatic
purples
and
reds
the
video
channels
sent
out
for
popular
consumption
but
it
was
with
a
certain
new
apprehension
that
walton
now
studied
the
kaleidoscopic
pattern
now
that
he
knew
what
a
dangerous
weapon
the
flashing
colors
could
be
how
could
he
be
certain
that
the
bronze
room
proprietors
were
not
flashing
some
scarcely
seen
subliminal
command
at
him
this
very
moment
he
turned
the
set
off
with
a
brusque
gesture
ends
justify
the
a
nice
homily
he
thought
which
allowed
him
to
do
almost
anything
it
brought
to
mind
the
rationale
of
ivan
karamazov
without
god
everything
is
permissible
but
both
god
and
dostoevski
seem
to
be
obsolete
these
days
he
reminded
himself
god
is
now
a
lean
young
man
with
an
office
on
the
floor
of
the
cullen
building
and
as
for
dostoevski
all
he
did
was
write
books
and
therefore
could
not
have
been
of
any
great
importance
he
felt
a
tremor
of
maybe
it
had
been
unwise
to
let
kaleidowhirl
propaganda
loose
on
the
world
once
unleashed
it
might
not
be
so
easily
caged
again
he
realized
that
as
soon
as
the
popeek
campaign
was
over
he
would
have
to
make
sure
some
method
was
devised
for
all
public
and
kaleidoscopic
patterns
the
most
damnable
part
of
such
propaganda
techniques
he
knew
was
that
you
could
put
over
almost
any
idea
at
all
without
arousing
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
viewer
he
would
know
he
been
tampered
with
you
could
tell
him
so
after
the
new
idea
had
been
planted
and
by
then
he
would
believe
you
walton
dialed
another
filtered
rum
and
lifted
it
to
his
lips
with
a
slightly
shaky
hand
ludwig
of
the
united
nations
called
while
you
were
out
sir
walton
was
told
upon
returning
to
his
office
he
like
you
to
call
him
back
very
well
make
the
connection
for
me
when
ludwig
appeared
walton
said
sorry
i
missed
your
call
happening
special
session
of
the
security
council
just
broke
up
they
passed
a
resolution
unanimously
and
shipped
it
on
to
the
assembly
going
to
be
an
immediate
hearing
to
determine
the
new
permanent
head
of
popeek
walton
clamped
his
lips
together
after
a
moment
he
said
how
come
the
dirnan
crisis
they
do
want
a
mere
interim
director
handling
things
they
feel
the
man
dealing
with
the
aliens
ought
to
have
full
un
blessing
should
i
interpret
that
to
mean
i
get
the
job
automatically
i
could
swear
to
it
said
ludwig
general
consensus
certainly
favors
you
to
continue
i
advise
that
you
show
up
at
the
hearing
in
person
and
present
your
program
in
detail
otherwise
they
may
stick
some
politico
in
your
place
the
noise
is
slated
to
start
at
day
after
tomorrow
the
eighteenth
i
be
there
walton
said
thanks
for
the
tip
he
chewed
the
end
of
his
stylus
for
a
moment
then
hastily
scribbled
down
the
appointment
as
of
now
he
knew
he
could
worry
too
strongly
about
events
taking
place
the
day
after
tomorrow
not
with
fred
arriving
for
a
the
next
morning
the
next
day
began
busily

fancy
tip
on
the
new
monorail
project
out
nevada

who
would

in
there
too
telefax

now
the
property

then
he
said
four
hundred
million
and
some
change
plus
my
usual
five
percent
commission
which
in
this
case
comes
to
about
two
and
a
quarter

but
i
offered
you

million
walton
said
that
offer
still
goes
you
want
me

on
murlin
that

walton
said
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
hectic
all
day
and
fred
was
due
at
xvi
hervey
showed
up
at
grinning
broadly
he
unfolded
a
thick
wad
of
documents
and
thrust
them
at
walton
i
hold
in
my
hand
the
world
most
potent
telefax
sheet
hervey
said
he
flipped
the
documents
casually
onto
walton
desk
and
laughed
they
all
yours
percent
every
bit
of
it
voting
stock
i
told
murlin
about
it
just
before
i
left
him
this
morning
he
turned
purple
what
did
he
say
what
he
say
i
asked
him
offhandedly
if
he
knew
where
all
the
outstanding
stock
was
and
he
said
yes
it
was
being
held
by
a
lot
of
small
holders
and
then
i
told
him
that
somebody
was
buying
out
the
small
holders
and
that
i
was
selling
my
four
percent
to
him
that
when
he
started
to
change
colors
when
i
left
he
was
busy
making
phone
calls
but
i
do
think
he
like
what
he
going
to
find
out
walton
riffled
through
the
papers
it
all
here
eh
fine
work
put
through
your
voucher
in
half
an
hour
or
so
unless
you
in
a
hurry
oh
do
rush
hervey
said
he
ran
a
finger
inside
his
collar
couple
of
security
boys
outside
they
really
gave
me
a
i
expecting
an
assassin
at
walton
said
lightly
they
on
the
lookout
oh
a
close
friend
a
relative
walton
said
fred
arrived
promptly
at
by
that
time
walton
had
already
set
the
machinery
in
operation
for
the
of
the
first
step
had
been
to
call
horace
murlin
and
confirm
the
fact
that
popeek
now
owned
the
telefax
sheet
murlin
fleshy
face
was
a
curious
shade
of
he
sputtered
at
walton
for
five
minutes
before
admitting
he
was
beaten
with
murlin
out
of
the
way
walton
selected
a
new
editorial
staff
for
the
paper
from
a
list
percy
supplied
he
intended
to
keep
the
reporting
crew
of
the
old
regime
intact
had
a
fantastically
efficient
newsgathering
team
and
there
was
no
point
in
breaking
it
up
it
was
the
level
walton
was
interested
in
controlling
the
edition
of
was
the
last
under
the
old
editors
they
had
received
word
from
murlin
about
what
had
happened
and
by
when
walton
sent
his
dismissal
notices
over
they
were
already
cleaning
out
their
desks
that
edition
was
a
beauty
though
the
lead
headline
read
we
chumps
for
the
greenskins
and
most
of
the
issue
was
devoted
to
inflammatory
journalism
a
full
page
of
letters
from
the
readers
actually
transcribed
phone
calls
since
few
of
readers
were
interested
in
writing
letters
echoed
the
editorial
stand
one
letter
in
particular
caught
walton
attention
it
was
from
a
of
new
york
city
environ
which
probably
meant
jersey
or
lower
connecticut
and
it
was
short
and
to
the
point
the
for
you
popeek
is
a
damned
crime
and
that
walton
criminal
ought
to
be
put
away
and
we
ought
to
kill
those
greenskins
up
there
before
they
kill
us
we
got
ta
have
room
to
them
before
they
kill
walton
snickered
all
the
old
hysterias
the
old
panic
reactions
come
boiling
up
again
in
times
of
stress
he
looked
at
his
hand
it
was
perfectly
steady
even
though
his
wrist
watch
told
him
fred
would
be
here
in
just
a
few
minutes
a
week
ago
a
situation
like
this
would
have
had
him
gobbling
benzolurethrin
as
fast
as
he
could
unwrap
the
lozenges
the
ghostly
presence
of
fitzmaugham
seemed
to
hover
in
the
room
ends
justify
the
walton
told
himself
grimly
as
he
waited
for
his
brother
to
arrive
fred
was
dressed
completely
in
black
from
his
stylish
waistcoat
and
the
bit
of
ribbon
at
his
throat
to
the
leather
pumps
on
his
feet
the
splendor
of
his
clothing
was
curiously
at
odds
with
the
coarseness
of
his
features
and
the
stockiness
of
his
body
he
walked
into
walton
office
at
the
stroke
of
and
sighed
deeply
the
sigh
of
a
man
about
to
take
permanent
possession
good
morning
roy
i
on
time
as
always
and
looking
radiant
my
dear
brother
walton
gestured
appreciatively
at
fred
clothes
it
been
a
long
time
since
i
seen
you
in
anything
but
your
lab
smock
i
gave
notice
at
the
lab
yesterday
night
after
i
spoke
to
you
no
longer
an
employee
of
popeek
and
i
felt
i
should
dress
with
the
dignity
suitable
to
my
new
rank
he
grinned
buoyantly
well
ready
to
turn
over
the
orb
and
scepter
roy
not
exactly
walton
said
but
but
i
promised
you
i
resign
in
your
favor
today
fred
i
do
think
i
ever
used
those
words
but
i
certainly
implied
it
did
i
of
course
you
did
you
told
me
to
come
here
at
and
you
arrange
the
transfer
walton
nodded
exactly
so
he
waited
a
long
moment
and
then
said
quietly
i
lied
fred
he
had
chosen
the
words
carefully
for
maximum
impact
he
had
not
chosen
wrongly
for
a
brief
instant
fred
face
was
very
pale
against
the
blackness
of
his
garb
total
disbelief
flickered
across
his
eyes
and
mouth
walton
had
considered
his
brother
mental
picture
of
him
the
elder
brother
virtuous
devoted
to
hard
work
kind
to
animals
and
just
a
little
soft
in
the
head
also
extremely
honest
fred
had
expected
walton
to
be
lying
and
the
calm
admission
stunned
him
you
not
planning
to
go
through
with
it
then
fred
asked
in
a
dead
voice
no
you
realize
what
this
means
in
terms
of
the
serum
do
you
the
moment
i
get
out
of
here
and
transmit
your
refusal
to
my
employers
they
begin
wholesale
manufacture
and
distribution
of
the
lamarre
serum
the
publicity
wo
be
good
roy
nor
the
result
you
wo
get
out
of
here
walton
said
another
shock
wave
rippled
over
fred
face
you
ca
be
serious
roy
my
employers
know
where
i
am
they
know
what
i
here
for
if
they
do
hear
from
me
within
hours
they
proceed
with
serum
distribution
you
ca
hope
to
i
risk
it
walton
interrupted
if
nothing
else
i
have
a
extension
you
did
really
think
i
could
hand
popeek
over
to
you
on
a
platter
fred
why
i
do
even
know
how
secure
my
position
is
here
so
i
afraid
i
have
to
back
down
on
my
offer
you
under
arrest
fred
fred
sprang
from
his
seat
and
circled
around
the
desk
toward
walton
for
a
moment
the
two
brothers
stared
at
each
other
faces
inches
apart
walton
put
one
hand
on
his
brother
shoulder
and
gripping
tightly
forced
him
around
to
the
front
of
the
desk
you
had
this
all
planned
did
you
fred
said
bitterly
yesterday
when
you
talked
to
me
you
knew
this
was
what
you
were
going
to
do
but
you
said
you
yield
and
i
believed
you
i
do
fool
easy
but
i
thought
i
had
you
pegged
because
you
were
my
brother
i
you
you
would
do
a
sneaky
thing
like
this
but
i
did
walton
said
suddenly
fred
jumped
he
charged
at
walton
blindly
head
down
in
the
same
motion
walton
signaled
for
keeler
and
his
men
to
break
in
and
met
fred
charge
he
caught
his
brother
in
midstride
with
a
swinging
punch
that
sent
his
head
cracking
back
sharply
fred
face
twisted
and
writhed
more
in
astonishment
than
pain
he
stepped
back
rubbing
his
chin
you
changed
he
said
this
made
you
tough
a
year
ago
you
would
never
have
done
this
to
me
walton
shrugged
look
behind
you
fred
and
this
time
you
can
trust
me
fred
turned
warily
keeler
and
two
other
security
men
stood
there
drug
him
and
take
him
away
walton
said
have
him
held
in
custody
until
i
notify
martinez
fred
eyes
widened
you
a
he
said
hoarsely
you
just

walton
repeated
keeler
stepped
forward
a
tiny
hypodermic
spray
cupped
in
his
hand
he
activated
it
with
a
twitch
of
his
thumb
and
touched
it
to
forearm
a
momentary
hum
droned
in
the
office
as
the
vibrating
spray
forced
the
drug
into
fred
arm
he
slumped
like
an
empty
sack
pick
him
up
keeler
ordered
take
him
and
let
get
going
the
story
broke
in
the
edition
of
and
from
the
general
tone
of
the
piece
walton
could
see
the
fine
hand
of
lee
percy
at
work
the
headline
was
tries
to
knock
off
popeek
after
the
usual
string
of
subheads
all
in
the
cheerful
breezy
barely
literate
style
came
the
body
of
the
story
guy
tried
to
bump
popeek
top
number
roy
walton
today
security
men
got
there
in
time
to
keep
walton
from
getting
the
same
finisher
as
dead
popeek
boss
fitzmaugham
got
last
says
he
all
right
the
assassin
did
even
come
close
he
also
told
our
man
that
he
expects
good
news
on
the
new
earth
bit
soon
we
like
the
sound
of
those
words
popeek
may
be
with
the
stream
after
all
who
knows
the
voice
was
that
of
but
the
man
behind
the
voice
was
thinking
a
little
differently
had
the
previous
editors
of
been
handling
the
break
the
prevailing
tone
would
most
likely
have
been
walton
called
percy
after
the
edition
came
out
nice
job
you
did
on
our
first
he
said
approvingly
it
just
what
i
want
same
illiterate
style
but
a
slow
swerving
of
editorial
slant
until
completely
wait
till
you
see
tomorrow
paper
we
just
getting
the
hang
of
it
and
we
have
our
first
kaleidowhirl
show
at
tonight
cost
a
fortune
to
buy
in
but
we
figured
that
the
best
hour
what
the
buried
message
as
you
said
percy
told
him
a
job
and
some
pacifist
stuff
we
got
a
team
of
pollsters
out
now
and
they
say
the
current
predominantly
going
the
other
way
we
be
able
to
tell
if
the
kaleidowhirl
stuff
works
out
all
right
keep
up
the
good
work
walton
said
we
get
there
yet
the
alien
is
due
to
arrive
for
another
day
or
so
mcleod
gets
into
nairobi
tomorrow
some
time
i
going
to
testify
before
the
un
tomorrow
too
i
hope
those
un
boys
are
watching
our
pretty
color
patterns
tonight
percy
grinned
boy
you
bet
walton
threw
himself
energetically
into
his
work
it
was
taking
shape
now
there
were
still
some
loose
ends
of
course
but
he
was
beginning
to
feel
that
some
end
to
the
tangle
of
interlocking
intrigues
was
in
sight
he
checked
with
a
public
recreation
director
and
discovered
there
would
be
a
block
forum
on
west
street
at
that
night
he
made
a
note
to
attend
and
arranged
to
have
a
synthetic
mask
fashioned
so
he
would
have
to
reveal
his
own
identity
hours
in
that
time
fred
employers
would
presumably
be
readying
themselves
to
loose
lamarre
serum
on
the
world
an
extraterrestrial
being
would
be
landing
on
earth
and
by
then
walton
would
have
been
called
to
render
an
account
of
his
stewardship
before
the
united
nations
the
annunciator
chimed
again
yes
walton
said
of
mount
palomar
observatory
calling
long
distance
to
talk
to
you
sir
put
him
on
walton
said
puzzledly
was
a
individual
with
compelling
eyes
he
introduced
himself
as
a
member
of
the
research
staff
at
mount
palomar
glad
i
could
finally
reach
you
he
said
in
a
staccato
burst
of
words
been
trying
to
call
for
an
hour
made
some
observations
of
venus
a
little
while
ago
and
i
thought
you
be
interested
venus
what
cloud
blanket
looks
awfully
funny
walton
blazing
away
like
sixty
got
the
whole
staff
down
here
to
discuss
it
and
the
way
it
looks
to
us
there
some
sort
of
atomic
going
on
in
venus
atmosphere
i
think
it
those
terraforming
men
you
popeek
folk
have
up
there
i
think
they
blown
the
whole
place
up
xvii
walton
stepped
off
the
jetbus
at
broadway
and
west
street
paused
for
a
moment
beneath
a
street
lamp
and
fingered
his
chin
to
see
if
his
mask
were
on
properly
it
was
three
youths
stood
leaning
against
a
nearby
building
could
you
tell
me
where
the
block
meeting
being
held
walton
asked
down
the
street
and
turn
left
you
a
telefax
man
just
an
interested
citizen
walton
said
thanks
for
the
directions
it
was
easy
to
see
where
the
block
meeting
was
walton
saw
streams
of
men
and
women
entering
a
bulky
old
building
just
off
street
he
joined
them
and
found
himself
carried
along
into
the
auditorium
nervously
he
found
a
seat
the
auditorium
was
an
old
one
predominantly
dark
brown
and
cavernous
with
row
after
row
of
hard
wooden
folding
chairs
someone
was
adjusting
a
microphone
on
stage
a
sharp
metallic
whine
came
over
the
system
testing
testing
one
two
three
it
all
right
max
someone
yelled
from
the
rear
walton
did
turn
around
to
look
a
low
undercurrent
of
murmuring
was
audible
it
was
only
the
meeting
was
not
due
to
start
for
another
fifteen
minutes
but
the
hall
was
nearly
full
with
more
than
a
thousand
of
the
local
residents
already
on
hand
the
fifteen
minutes
passed
slowly
walton
listened
carefully
to
the
conversations
around
him
no
one
was
discussing
the
venus
situation
apparently
his
cloud
of
censorship
had
been
effective
he
had
instructed
percy
to
keep
all
word
of
the
disaster
from
the
public
until
the
newsblares
by
that
time
the
people
would
have
been
exposed
to
the
indoctrinating
kaleidowhirl
program
at
and
their
reaction
would
be
accordingly
more
temperate
he
hoped
also
releasing
the
news
early
would
have
further
complicated
the
survey
walton
was
trying
to
make
by
attending
this
public
meeting
the
index
of
public
confusion
increased
factorially
one
extra
consideration
for
discussion
and
walton
task
would
be
hopelessly
difficult
at
exactly
a
tall
man
stepped
out
on
the
stage
he
seized
the
microphone
as
if
it
were
a
twig
and
said
hello
folks
glad
to
see
you
all
here
tonight
this
is
an
important
meeting
for
us
all
in
case
some
of
you
do
know
me
and
i
do
see
some
new
faces
out
there
i
dave
forman
president
of
the
west
street
association
i
also
run
a
little
law
business
on
the
side
just
to
help
pay
the
rent
giggles
as
usual
in
these
meetings
forman
went
on
we
have
a
brief
panel
discussion
and
then
i
throw
the
thing
open
to
you
folks
for
floor
discussion
the
panelists
tonight
are
people
you
all
know
sadie
hargreave
dominic
campobello
rudi
steinfeld
come
on
out
here
folks
the
panelists
appeared
on
the
stage
diffidently
sadie
hargreave
was
a
short
stout
little
woman
campobello
was
chunky
balding
steinfeld
tall
and
ascetic
walton
was
astonished
that
there
should
be
such
camaraderie
here
was
it
all
synthetic
it
did
seem
that
way
he
had
always
remained
aloof
never
mingling
with
his
neighbors
in
the
gigantic
project
where
he
lived
never
suspecting
the
existence
of
community
life
on
this
scale
but
somehow
community
life
had
sprung
up
in
this
most
gargantuan
of
cities
organizations
within
each
project
within
each
block
perhaps
had
arisen
converting
new
york
into
an
interlocking
series
of
small
towns
ought
to
investigate
the
grass
roots
more
walton
thought
having
a
night
on
the
hello
folks
sadie
hargreave
said
aggressively
i
glad
i
can
talk
to
you
tonight
gosh
i
want
to
speak
out
i
think
it
crazy
to
let
these
from
outer
space
push
us
around
i
for
one
feel
we
ought
to
take
strong
action
against
that
space
world
cries
of
yeah
yeah
go
to
it
sadie
rose
from
the
audience
skillfully
she
presented
three
inflammatory
arguments
in
favor
of
war
with
dirna
backing
up
each
with
a
referent
of
high
emotional
connotation
walton
watched
her
performance
with
growing
admiration
the
woman
was
a
born
public
relations
technician
it
was
too
bad
she
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
he
saw
the
effect
she
had
people
were
nodding
in
agreement
grimacing
vehemently
muttering
to
themselves
the
mood
of
the
meeting
he
gathered
was
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
war
if
dirna
did
not
yield
new
earth
dominic
campobello
began
his
address
by
inviting
all
and
sundry
to
his
barber
shop
this
was
greeted
with
laughter
then
he
launched
into
a
discourse
on
popeek
as
an
enemy
of
mankind
a
few
catcalls
walton
noted
but
again
chiefly
approval
campobello
seemed
sincere
the
third
man
rudi
steinfeld
was
a
local
music
teacher
he
too
spoke
out
against
popeek
though
in
a
restrained
dryly
intellectual
manner
people
began
yawning
steinfeld
cut
his
speech
short
it
was
now
in
one
hour
percy
kaleidowhirl
program
would
be
screened
walton
stayed
at
the
block
meeting
until
listening
to
citizen
after
citizen
rise
and
heap
curses
upon
popeek
dirna
or
walton
depending
on
where
his
particular
ire
lay
at
walton
rose
and
left
the
hall
he
phoned
percy
i
on
west
street
just
attended
a
block
meeting
i
say
the
prevailing
sentiment
runs
about
ninety
percent
agin
us
we
do
have
the
people
backing
our
program
any
more
lee
we
never
did
but
i
think
we
nail
now
the
kaleidowhirl
ready
to
go
and
it
a
honey
and
i
think
will
sell
too
on
our
way
roy
i
hope
so
walton
said
he
was
unable
to
bring
himself
to
watch
percy
program
even
though
he
reached
his
room
in
time
that
night
he
knew
there
could
be
no
harm
in
watching
at
least
not
for
him
but
the
idea
of
voluntarily
submitting
his
mind
to
external
tampering
was
too
repugnant
to
accept
instead
he
spent
the
hour
dictating
a
report
on
the
block
meeting
for
benefit
of
his
pollster
staff
when
he
was
done
with
that
he
turned
to
the
edition
of
which
came
clicking
from
the
telefax
slot
right
on
schedule
he
had
to
look
hard
for
the
venus
story
finally
he
found
it
tucked
away
at
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
on
big
blowup
took
place
on
the
planet
venus
earlier
today
who
watched
the
popoff
say
it
was
caused
by
an
atomic
explosion
in
the
planet
attempts
are
being
made
to
reach
the
team
of
earth
engineers
working
on
venus
no
word
from
them
yet
they
may
be
walton
chuckled
may
be
indeed
by
now
lang
and
his
team
and
the
rescue
mission
as
well
lay
dead
under
showers
of
radioactive
formaldehyde
and
venus
had
been
turned
into
a
blazing
hell
ten
times
less
livable
than
it
had
been
before
percy
had
mishandled
the
news
superbly
for
one
thing
he
had
carefully
neglected
to
link
lang
with
popeek
in
any
way
that
was
good
connotative
thinking
it
would
be
senseless
to
identify
popeek
in
the
public
mind
with
disasters
or
fiascos
of
any
kind
for
another
the
skimpy
insignificance
of
the
piece
implied
that
it
had
been
some
natural
phenomenon
that
sent
venus
up
in
flames
not
the
fumbling
attempts
of
the
terraformers
good
handling
there
too
walton
felt
cheerful
he
slept
soundly
knowing
that
the
public
consciousness
was
being
properly
shaped
by
when
he
arrived
at
his
office
the
pollsters
had
reported
a
ten
percent
swing
in
public
opinion
in
the
direction
of
popeek
and
walton
at
hit
the
slots
with
an
extra
announcing
that
prospects
for
peaceful
occupation
of
new
earth
looked
excellent
the
editorial
praised
walton
the
column
carefully
fabricated
by
lee
percy
showed
a
definite
upswing
of
opinion
the
trend
continued
and
it
was
contagious
by
when
walton
left
the
cullen
building
and
caught
a
jetcopter
for
united
nations
headquarters
the
trend
in
public
opinion
was
almost
overwhelming
the
copter
put
down
before
the
gleaming
facade
of
un
headquarters
walton
handed
the
man
a
bill
and
went
inside
where
a
ludwig
was
waiting
for
him
they
started
early
ludwig
said
it
been
going
on
since
how
do
things
look
i
puzzled
roy
couple
of
are
screaming
for
your
scalp
but
you
getting
help
from
unexpected
quarters
old
mogens
snorreson
of
denmark
suddenly
got
up
and
said
it
was
necessary
for
the
safety
of
mankind
that
we
give
you
a
permanent
appointment
as
director
of
popeek
but
has
he
been
the
one
who
wanted
me
bounced
ludwig
nodded
that
what
i
mean
the
climate
is
changing
definitely
changing
ride
the
crest
roy
the
way
things
look
now
you
may
end
up
being
swept
into
office
for
life
they
entered
the
giant
assembly
hall
at
the
dais
a
man
with
bright
teeth
was
speaking
who
that
walton
whispered
malcolm
nbono
the
delegate
from
ghana
he
regards
you
as
a
sort
of
saint
for
our
times
walton
slipped
into
a
seat
in
the
gallery
and
said
let
listen
from
here
before
we
go
down
below
i
want
to
catch
my
breath
the
young
man
from
ghana
was
saying
crisis
points
are
common
to
humanity
many
years
ago
when
my
people
came
from
their
colonial
status
and
achieved
independence
we
learned
that
painstaking
negotiations
and
peaceful
approaches
are
infinitely
more
efficacious
than
frontal
attack
by
violent
means
in
my
eyes
roy
walton
is
an
outstanding
exponent
of
this
philosophy
i
urge
his
election
as
director
of
the
bureau
of
population
equalization
a
ponderous
man
to
nbono
right
shouted
bravo
at
that
point
and
added
several
thick
scandinavian
expletives
that
good
old
mogens
the
dane
really
is
on
your
side
this
morning
ludwig
said
must
have
been
watching
the
kaleidowhirl
last
night
walton
murmured
the
delegate
from
ghana
concluded
with
a
brief
tremolo
cadenza
praising
walton
walton
eyes
were
a
little
moist
he
had
realized
he
was
a
saint
nbono
tacked
on
an
abrupt
coda
and
sat
down
all
right
walton
said
let
go
down
there
they
made
a
grand
entrance
ludwig
took
his
seat
behind
the
neon
sign
and
walton
slid
into
the
unoccupied
seat
to
ludwig
right
a
definite
stir
of
interest
was
noticeable
the
was
presiding
lars
magnusson
of
sweden
i
see
walton
of
popeek
has
arrived
he
commented
by
a
resolution
passed
unanimously
yesterday
we
have
invited
walton
this
morning
to
address
us
briefly
walton
would
you
care
to
speak
now
thank
you
very
much
walton
said
he
rose
the
delegates
were
staring
at
him
with
great
interest
and
somewhere
behind
them
obscured
by
the
bright
lights
of
the
cameras
there
were
he
sensed
a
vast
multitude
of
onlookers
peering
at
him
from
the
galleries
onlookers
who
had
seen
percy
kaleidowhirl
last
night
evidently
a
thunderous
wave
of
applause
swept
down
on
him
is
too
he
thought
kaleidowhirl
program
seems
to
have
hypnotized
he
moistened
his
lips
members
of
the
assembly
friends
i
very
grateful
for
this
chance
to
come
before
you
on
my
own
behalf
my
understanding
that
you
are
to
choose
a
permanent
successor
to
fitzmaugham
today
i
offer
myself
as
a
candidate
for
that
post
he
had
planned
a
long
impassioned
semantically
loaded
speech
to
sway
them
but
the
happenings
thus
far
this
morning
convinced
him
it
was
unnecessary
the
kaleidowhirl
had
done
the
work
for
him
my
qualifications
for
the
post
should
be
apparent
to
all
i
worked
with
the
late
director
fitzmaugham
during
the
formative
days
of
popeek
upon
his
death
i
succeeded
to
his
post
and
have
efficiently
maintained
the
operation
of
the
bureau
during
the
eight
days
since
his
assassination
there
are
special
circumstances
which
dictate
my
continuation
in
office
perhaps
you
know
of
the
failure
of
our
terraforming
experiments
the
destruction
of
our
outpost
on
venus
and
the
permanent
damage
done
to
that
planet
the
failure
of
this
project
makes
it
imperative
that
we
move
outward
to
the
stars
to
relieve
our
population
crisis
he
took
a
deep
breath
in
exactly
four
hours
he
said
a
representative
of
an
alien
race
will
land
on
earth
to
confer
with
the
director
of
popeek
i
can
not
stress
too
greatly
the
importance
of
maintaining
a
continuity
of
thought
and
action
within
our
bureau
bluntly
it
is
essential
that
be
the
one
who
deals
with
this
alien
i
ask
for
your
support
thank
you
he
took
his
seat
again
ludwig
was
staring
at
him
aghast
roy
what
kind
of
a
speech
was
that
you
ca
just
the
job
you
got
to
give
reasons
you
have
to
hush
walton
said
do
worry
about
it
were
you
watching
the
kaleidowhirls
last
night
me
of
course
not
walton
grinned
were
he
said
gesturing
at
the
other
delegates
i
not
worried
xviii
walton
left
the
assembly
meeting
about
pleading
urgent
popeek
business
the
voting
began
at
and
half
an
hour
later
the
result
was
officially
released
the
was
the
first
to
carry
the
report
elected
popeek
general
assembly
of
the
united
nations
gave
roy
walton
a
healthy
vote
of
confidence
today
by
a
vote
three
abstaining
he
was
picked
to
succeed
the
late
fitzmaugham
as
popeek
czar
he
has
held
the
post
on
a
temporary
basis
for
the
past
eight
walton
rang
up
percy
who
wrote
that
piece
on
me
he
asked
i
did
chief
why
nicely
done
but
not
enough
sock
get
all
those
words
out
of
it
by
the
next
edition
get
back
to
the
old
style
of
jazzy
writing
we
thought
we
brush
it
up
a
little
now
that
you
in
percy
said
no
that
dangerous
keep
to
the
old
style
but
revamp
the
content
we
rolling
along
now
what
new
from
the
pollsters
fifty
percent
swing
to
popeek
you
the
most
popular
man
in
the
country
as
of
noon
churches
are
offering
up
prayers
for
you
a
move
afoot
to
make
you
president
of
the
united
states
in
place
of
old
lanson
let
lanson
keep
his
job
walton
chuckled
i
not
looking
for
any
figurehead
jobs
i
too
young
when
the
next
due
at
we
keeping
up
hourly
editions
until
the
crisis
is
over
walton
thought
for
a
moment
i
think
too
early
the
dirnan
arrives
in
nairobi
at
our
time
i
want
a
big
splash
in
the
edition
but
not
a
word
before
then
i
with
you
percy
said
and
signed
off
a
moment
later
the
annunciator
said
there
a
call
for
you
from
batavia
sir
from
where
batavia
java
let
have
it
walton
said
a
fleshy
face
filled
the
screen
the
face
of
a
man
who
had
lived
a
soft
life
in
a
moist
climate
a
rumbling
voice
said
you
are
walton
i
am
walton
i
am
gaetano
di
cassio
pleased
of
making
the
acquaintance
signor
director
walton
i
own
rubber
plantation
in
the
area
here
walton
mind
immediately
clocked
off
the
top
name
on
the
list
of
landed
proprietors
lassen
had
prepared
for
him
cassio
gaetano
holdings
estimated
at
better
than
a
billion
and
a
quarter
born
genoa
settled
in
amsterdam
purchased
large
java
holding
what
can
i
do
for
you
di
cassio
the
rubber
magnate
looked
ill
his
fleshy
face
was
beaded
with
globules
of
sweat
your
brother
he
grunted
heavily
your
brother
worked
for
me
i
sent
him
to
see
you
yesterday
he
has
not
come
back
indeed
walton
shrugged
there
a
famous
phrase
i
could
use
at
this
point
i
wo
make
no
flippancies
di
cassio
said
heavily
where
is
he
walton
said
in
jail
attempted
coercion
of
a
public
official
he
realized
di
cassio
was
twice
as
nervous
and
tense
as
he
was
you
have
jailed
him
di
cassio
repeated
flatly
ah
i
see
jail
the
audio
pickup
brought
in
the
sound
of
stertorous
breathing
will
you
not
free
him
di
cassio
asked
i
will
not
did
he
not
tell
you
what
would
happen
if
he
would
not
be
granted
his
request
he
told
me
walton
said
well
the
fat
man
looked
sick
walton
saw
that
the
bluff
was
going
to
be
unsuccessful
that
the
conspirators
would
not
dare
put
lamarre
drug
into
open
production
it
had
been
a
weapon
without
weight
and
walton
had
not
let
himself
be
cowed
by
it
well
walton
repeated
inflexibly
you
trouble
me
sorely
said
di
cassio
you
give
my
heart
pain
walton
steps
will
have
to
be
taken
the
lamarre
immortality
serum
the
face
on
the
screen
turned
a
leaden
gray
the
serum
di
cassio
said
is
not
entered
into
this
talking
oh
no
my
brother
fred
made
a
few
remarks
serum
walton
smiled
calmly
a
nonexistent
serum
he
said
has
unfortunately
nonexistent
leverage
against
me
you
do
scare
me
di
cassio
i
outbluffed
you
go
take
a
walk
around
your
plantation
while
you
still
have
it
that
is
steps
will
be
taken
di
cassio
said
but
his
malevolence
was
hollow
walton
laughed
and
broke
contact
he
drew
lassen
list
from
his
desk
and
inscribed
a
brief
memo
to
olaf
eglin
on
it
these
were
the
hundred
biggest
estates
in
the
world
within
a
week
there
would
be
equalized
japanese
living
on
all
of
them
he
called
martinez
of
security
i
ordered
my
brother
fred
remanded
to
your
care
he
said
i
know
the
security
man
sounded
peeved
we
ca
hold
a
man
indefinitely
not
even
on
your
director
walton
the
charge
is
conspiracy
walton
said
conspiracy
against
the
successful
operation
of
popeek
i
have
a
list
of
the
ringleaders
on
your
desk
in
half
an
hour
i
want
them
rounded
up
given
a
thorough
psyching
and
jailed
there
are
times
martinez
said
slowly
when
i
suspect
you
exceed
your
powers
director
walton
but
send
me
the
list
and
i
have
the
arrests
made
the
afternoon
crawled
walton
proceeded
with
routine
work
on
half
a
dozen
fronts
held
screened
conferences
with
each
of
his
section
chiefs
read
reports
augmenting
what
he
already
knew
of
the
venus
disaster
and
gobbled
a
few
benzolurethrin
tranquilizers
he
called
keeler
and
learned
that
no
sign
of
lamarre
had
come
to
light
yet
from
percy
he
discovered
that
had
added
two
hundred
thousand
subscribers
overnight
the
edition
had
a
lengthy
editorial
praising
walton
and
some
letters
that
percy
swore
were
genuine
doing
the
same
at
olaf
eglin
called
to
announce
that
the
big
estates
were
in
the
process
of
being
dismembered
you
be
able
to
hear
the
howls
from
here
to
batavia
when
we
get
going
eglin
warned
we
have
to
be
tough
walton
told
him
firmly
at
he
devoted
a
few
minutes
to
a
scientific
paper
that
proposed
terraforming
pluto
by
establishing
synthetic
suns
on
the
icy
planet
walton
skimmed
through
the
specifications
which
involved
passing
a
current
of
several
million
amperes
through
a
tube
containing
a
mixture
of
tritium
and
deuterium
the
general
idea
he
gathered
was
to
create
electromagnetic
forces
of
intensity
a
engine
would
supply
a
hundred
megawatts
of
power
continuously
at
degrees
centigrade
walton
noted
and
forwarded
the
plan
on
to
eglin
it
sounded
plausible
enough
but
walton
was
personally
skeptical
of
undertaking
any
more
terraforming
experiments
after
the
venus
fiasco
there
were
after
all
limits
to
the
public
relations
miracles
lee
percy
could
create
at
the
annunciator
chimed
again
call
from
nairobi
africa
mr
walton
okay
mcleod
appeared
on
the
screen
we
here
he
said
arrived
safely
half
a
microsecond
ago
and
all
well
how
about
the
alien
we
have
him
in
a
specially
constructed
cabin
breathes
hydrogen
and
ammonia
you
know
he
very
anxious
to
see
you
when
can
you
come
walton
thought
for
a
moment
i
guess
there
no
way
of
transporting
him
here
is
there
i
would
advise
it
the
dirnans
are
very
sensitive
about
traveling
in
such
a
low
gravitational
field
makes
their
stomachs
queasy
you
know
do
you
think
you
could
come
out
here
when
the
earliest
oh
half
an
hour
mcleod
suggested
i
on
my
way
said
walton
the
sprawling
metropolis
of
nairobi
capital
of
the
republic
of
kenya
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
kikuyu
hills
and
magnificent
mount
kilimanjaro
towered
above
it
four
million
people
inhabited
nairobi
finest
of
the
many
fine
cities
along
africa
western
coast
africa
negro
republics
had
built
soundly
and
well
after
achieving
their
liberation
from
colonial
status
the
city
was
calm
as
walton
special
jet
decelerated
for
landing
at
the
vast
nairobi
airport
he
had
left
at
new
york
time
the
transatlantic
trip
had
taken
two
hours
and
some
minutes
and
there
was
an
time
zone
differential
between
kenya
and
new
york
it
was
now
in
nairobi
the
rain
was
falling
right
on
schedule
as
the
jet
taxied
to
a
halt
mcleod
was
there
to
meet
him
the
ship
in
the
hills
five
miles
out
of
town
there
a
copter
waiting
for
you
here
moments
after
leaving
the
jetliner
walton
was
shepherded
aboard
the
rotors
whirred
the
rose
perpendicularly
until
it
hung
just
above
the
at
feet
then
fired
its
jets
and
streaked
toward
the
hills
it
was
not
raining
when
they
landed
according
to
mcleod
the
night
rain
was
scheduled
for
in
this
sector
and
the
seeders
had
already
been
here
and
moved
on
to
bring
rain
to
the
city
proper
a
groundcar
waited
for
them
at
the
airstrip
in
the
hills
mcleod
drove
handling
the
turboelectric
job
with
skill
there
the
ship
he
said
proudly
pointing
walton
felt
a
sudden
throat
lump
the
ship
stood
on
its
tail
in
the
midst
of
a
wide
flat
swath
of
concrete
it
was
at
least
five
hundred
feet
high
a
towering
pale
needle
shimmering
brightly
in
the
moonlight
wideswept
tailjets
supported
it
like
arching
buttresses
men
moved
busily
about
in
the
floodlighted
area
at
its
base
mcleod
drove
up
to
the
ship
and
around
it
the
flawless
symmetry
of
the
foreside
was
not
duplicated
behind
there
a
spidery
catwalk
ran
some
eighty
feet
up
the
side
of
the
ship
to
a
gaping
lock
and
by
its
side
a
crude
elevator
shaft
rose
to
the
same
hatch
mcleod
drew
efficient
salutes
from
the
men
as
he
left
the
car
walton
only
puzzled
glares
we
better
take
the
elevator
mcleod
said
the
men
are
working
on
the
catwalk
silently
they
rode
up
into
the
ship
they
stepped
through
the
open
airlock
into
a
paneled
lounge
then
into
narrow
companionways
mcleod
paused
and
pressed
down
a
stud
in
an
alcove
along
the
way
i
back
he
announced
tell
thogran
klayrn
that
i
brought
walton
find
out
whether
he
come
out
to
talk
to
him
i
thought
he
had
to
breathe
special
atmosphere
walton
said
how
can
he
come
out
they
got
breathing
masks
usually
they
do
like
to
use
them
mcleod
listened
at
the
earpiece
for
a
moment
then
nodded
to
walton
he
said
the
alien
will
see
you
in
the
lounge
walton
had
barely
time
to
fortify
himself
with
a
slug
of
filtered
rum
when
a
crewman
appeared
at
the
entrance
to
the
lounge
and
declared
ostentatiously
his
excellency
thogran
klayrn
of
dirna
the
alien
entered
walton
had
seen
the
photographs
and
so
he
was
partially
prepared
but
only
partially
the
photos
had
not
given
him
any
idea
of
size
the
alien
stood
eight
feet
high
and
gave
an
appearance
of
astonishing
mass
it
must
have
weighed
four
or
five
hundred
pounds
but
it
stood
on
two
thick
legs
barely
three
feet
long
somewhere
near
the
middle
of
the
columnar
body
four
sturdy
arms
jutted
forth
strangely
a
neckless
head
topped
the
ponderous
creature
a
head
covered
entirely
with
the
transparent
breathing
mask
one
of
the
hands
held
a
mechanical
device
of
some
sort
the
translating
machine
walton
surmised
the
alien
hide
was
and
leathery
in
texture
a
faint
pungent
odor
drifted
through
the
room
as
of
an
object
long
immersed
in
ammonia
i
am
thogran
klayrn
a
booming
voice
said
diplomasiarch
of
dirna
i
have
been
sent
to
talk
with
roy
walton
are
you
roy
walton
i
am
walton
voice
sounded
cold
and
dry
to
his
own
ears
he
knew
he
was
too
tense
pressing
too
hard
i
very
glad
to
meet
you
thogran
klayrn
please
sit
i
do
not
my
body
is
not
made
that
way
walton
sat
it
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
to
have
to
crane
his
neck
upward
at
the
alien
but
that
could
not
be
helped
did
you
have
a
pleasant
trip
walton
asked
temporizing
desperately
a
came
from
thogran
klayrn
indeed
it
was
so
but
i
do
not
indulge
in
little
talk
a
problem
we
have
and
it
must
be
discussed
agreed
whatever
a
diplomasiarch
might
be
on
dirna
it
was
a
typical
diplomat
walton
was
relieved
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
spend
hours
in
formalities
before
they
reached
the
main
problem
a
ship
sent
out
by
your
people
the
alien
said
invaded
our
system
some
time
ago
in
command
was
your
colonel
mcleod
whom
i
have
come
to
know
well
what
was
the
purpose
of
this
ship
to
explore
the
worlds
of
the
universe
and
to
discover
a
planet
where
we
of
earth
could
settle
our
world
is
very
overcrowded
now
so
i
have
been
given
to
know
you
have
chosen
labura
or
in
your
terms
procyon
viii
as
your
colony
is
this
so
yes
walton
said
it
a
perfect
world
for
our
purposes
but
colonel
mcleod
has
informed
me
that
you
object
to
our
settling
there
we
do
so
object
the
dirnan
voice
was
cold
you
are
a
young
and
active
race
we
do
not
know
what
danger
you
may
bring
to
us
to
have
you
as
our
neighbors
we
could
swear
a
treaty
of
eternal
peace
walton
said
words
mere
words
but
do
you
see
that
we
ca
even
on
that
planet
of
yours
it
too
big
too
heavy
for
us
what
possible
harm
could
we
do
there
are
races
said
the
dirnan
heavily
which
believe
in
violence
as
a
sacred
act
you
have
missiles
how
might
we
trust
you
walton
squirmed
then
sudden
inspiration
struck
him
there
a
planet
in
this
system
that
as
suitable
for
your
people
as
labura
is
for
ours
i
mean
jupiter
we
could
offer
you
colonial
rights
to
jupiter
in
exchange
for
the
privilege
of
colonizing
labura
the
alien
was
silent
for
a
moment
considering
there
was
no
way
of
telling
what
emotions
passed
across
that
face
at
length
the
alien
said
not
satisfactory
our
people
have
long
since
reached
stability
of
population
we
have
no
need
of
colonies
it
has
been
many
thousands
of
your
years
since
we
have
ventured
into
space
walton
felt
chilled
thousands
of
years
he
realized
he
was
up
against
a
formidable
life
form
we
have
learned
to
stabilize
births
and
deaths
the
dirnan
went
on
sonorously
it
is
a
fundamental
law
of
the
universe
and
one
that
you
earthfolk
must
learn
sooner
or
later
how
you
choose
to
do
it
is
your
own
business
but
we
have
no
need
of
planets
in
your
system
and
we
fear
allowing
you
to
enter
ours
the
matter
is
simple
of
statement
difficult
of
resolution
but
we
are
open
to
suggestions
from
you
walton
mind
blanked
suggestions
what
possible
suggestion
could
he
make
he
gasped
we
have
something
to
offer
he
said
it
might
be
of
value
to
a
race
that
has
achieved
population
stability
we
would
give
it
to
you
in
exchange
for
colonization
rights
what
is
this
commodity
the
dirnan
asked
immortality
walton
said
xix
he
returned
to
new
york
alone
later
that
night
too
tired
to
sleep
and
too
wide
awake
to
relax
he
felt
like
a
poker
player
who
had
triumphantly
topped
four
kings
with
four
aces
and
now
was
fumbling
in
his
hand
trying
to
locate
some
of
those
aces
for
his
skeptical
opponents
the
alien
had
accepted
his
offer
that
was
the
one
solid
fact
he
was
able
to
cling
to
on
the
lonely
night
ride
back
from
nairobi
the
rest
was
a
quicksand
of
ifs
and
maybes
lamarre
could
be
found
the
serum
actually
had
any
value
it
was
equally
effective
on
earthmen
and
dirnans
walton
tried
to
dismiss
the
alternatives
he
had
made
a
desperately
wild
offer
and
it
had
been
accepted
new
earth
was
open
for
colonization
the
world
outside
the
jet
was
a
dark
blur
he
had
left
nairobi
at
nairobi
time
jetting
back
across
the
eight
intervening
time
zones
he
would
arrive
in
new
york
around
midnight
ultrarapid
jet
transit
made
such
things
possible
he
would
live
twice
through
the
early
hours
of
june
nineteenth
new
york
had
a
fifteen
minute
rain
scheduled
at
that
night
walton
reached
the
housing
project
where
he
lived
just
as
the
rain
was
turned
on
the
night
was
otherwise
a
little
muggy
he
paused
outside
the
main
entrance
letting
the
drops
fall
on
him
after
a
few
minutes
feeling
faintly
foolish
and
very
tired
he
went
inside
shook
himself
dry
and
went
to
bed
he
did
not
sleep
four
caffeine
tablets
helped
him
get
off
to
a
running
start
in
the
morning
he
arrived
at
the
cullen
building
early
about
and
spent
some
time
bringing
his
private
journal
up
to
date
explaining
in
detail
the
burden
of
his
interview
with
the
alien
ambassador
some
day
walton
thought
a
historian
of
the
future
would
discover
his
journal
and
find
that
for
a
short
period
in
a
man
named
roy
walton
had
acted
as
absolute
dictator
of
humanity
the
odd
thing
walton
reflected
was
that
he
had
absolutely
no
power
drive
he
had
been
pitchforked
into
the
role
and
each
of
his
successive
steps
had
been
taken
quite
genuinely
in
the
name
of
humanity
rationalization
perhaps
but
a
necessary
one
at
walton
took
a
deep
breath
and
called
keeler
of
security
the
security
man
smiled
oddly
and
said
i
was
just
about
to
call
you
sir
we
have
some
news
at
last
news
what
lamarre
we
found
his
body
this
morning
just
about
an
hour
ago
murdered
it
turned
up
in
marseilles
pretty
badly
decomposed
but
we
ran
a
full
check
and
the
retinal
absolutely
lamarre
oh
walton
said
leadenly
his
head
swam
definitely
lamarre
he
repeated
thanks
keeler
fine
work
fine
something
wrong
sir
you
look
i
very
tired
walton
said
that
all
tired
thanks
keeler
you
called
me
about
something
sir
keeler
reminded
him
gently
oh
i
was
calling
about
lamarre
i
guess
there
no
point
in
thanks
keeler
he
broke
the
contact
for
the
first
time
walton
felt
total
despair
and
out
of
despair
came
a
sort
of
deathlike
calmness
with
lamarre
dead
his
only
hope
of
obtaining
the
serum
was
to
free
fred
and
wangle
the
notes
from
him
but
fred
price
for
the
notes
would
be
walton
job
full
circle
and
a
dead
end
perhaps
fred
could
be
induced
to
reveal
the
whereabouts
of
the
notes
it
was
likely
but
it
was
possible
and
if
not
walton
shrugged
a
man
could
do
only
so
much
terraforming
had
proved
a
failure
equalization
was
a
stopgap
of
limited
value
and
the
one
extrasolar
planet
worth
colonizing
was
held
by
aliens
dead
end
walton
thought
let
someone
else
he
shook
his
head
trying
to
clear
the
fog
of
negation
that
suddenly
surrounded
him
his
thinking
was
all
wrong
he
had
to
keep
trying
had
to
investigate
every
possible
avenue
before
giving
up
his
fingers
hovered
lightly
over
a
benzolurethrin
tablet
then
drew
back
stiffly
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
switched
on
the
annunciator
i
leaving
the
office
for
a
while
he
said
hoarsely
send
all
calls
to
mr
eglin
he
had
to
see
fred
security
keep
was
a
big
blocky
building
beyond
the
city
limits
proper
a
windowless
tower
near
nyack
new
york
walton
private
jetcopter
dropped
noiselessly
to
the
landing
stage
on
the
wide
parapet
of
the
building
he
contemplated
its
metallic
exterior
for
a
moment
should
i
wait
here
the
pilot
asked
yes
walton
said
with
accession
to
the
permanent
directorship
he
rated
a
private
ship
and
a
live
pilot
i
wo
be
here
long
he
left
the
landing
stage
and
stepped
within
an
indicated
screener
field
there
was
a
long
pause
the
air
up
here
walton
thought
is
fresh
and
clean
not
like
city
air
a
voice
said
what
is
your
business
here
i
walton
director
of
popeek
i
have
an
appointment
with
security
head
martinez
wait
a
moment
director
walton
none
of
the
obsequious
and
walton
had
grown
accustomed
to
in
its
way
the
bluntness
of
address
was
as
refreshing
as
the
unpolluted
air
walton
keen
ears
detected
a
gentle
electronic
whirr
he
was
being
thoroughly
scanned
after
a
moment
the
metal
door
before
him
rose
silently
into
a
hidden
slot
and
he
found
himself
facing
an
inner
door
of
burnished
copper
a
screen
was
set
in
the
inner
door
martinez
face
confronted
him
good
morning
director
walton
you
here
for
our
interview
yes
the
inner
door
closed
this
time
two
chunky
atomic
cannons
came
barreling
down
to
face
him
snout
first
walton
flinched
involuntarily
but
a
smiling
martinez
stepped
before
them
and
greeted
him
well
why
are
you
here
to
see
a
prisoner
of
yours
my
brother
fred
martinez
frowned
and
passed
a
delicate
hand
through
his
rumpled
hair
seeing
prisoners
is
positively
forbidden
walton
seeing
them
in
person
that
is
i
could
arrange
a
video
screening
for
you
forbidden
but
the
man
here
on
my
word
alone
i
your
powers
walton
are
still
somewhat
less
than
infinite
this
is
one
rule
we
never
have
relaxed
and
never
will
the
prisoners
in
the
keep
are
under
constant
security
surveillance
and
your
presence
in
the
cell
block
would
undermine
our
entire
system
will
video
do
i
guess
it
have
to
walton
said
he
was
not
of
a
mind
to
argue
now
come
with
me
then
said
martinez
the
little
man
led
him
down
a
dim
corridor
into
a
side
room
one
entire
wall
of
which
was
an
unlit
video
screen
you
have
total
privacy
in
here
martinez
assured
him
he
did
things
to
a
dial
set
in
the
wall
and
murmured
a
few
words
the
screen
began
to
glow
you
can
call
me
when
you
through
martinez
said
he
seemed
to
glide
out
of
the
room
leaving
walton
alone
with
fred
the
huge
screen
was
like
a
window
directly
into
fred
cell
walton
met
his
brother
bitter
gaze
head
on
fred
looked
demonic
his
eyes
were
ringed
by
black
shadows
his
hair
was
uncombed
his
face
unwashed
he
said
welcome
to
my
palatial
abode
dearest
brother
fred
do
make
it
hard
for
me
i
came
here
to
try
to
clarify
things
i
did
to
stick
you
away
here
i
to
fred
smiled
balefully
you
do
need
to
apologize
it
was
entirely
my
fault
i
underestimated
you
i
did
realize
you
had
changed
i
thought
you
were
the
same
old
dope
i
grew
up
with
you
are
possibly
walton
wished
he
had
taken
that
benzolurethrin
after
all
every
nerve
in
his
body
seemed
to
be
jumping
he
said
i
found
out
today
that
lamarre
dead
so
so
there
no
possible
way
for
popeek
to
obtain
the
immortality
serum
except
through
you
fred
i
need
that
serum
i
promised
it
to
the
alien
in
exchange
for
colonization
rights
on
procyon
viii
a
neat
little
package
deal
fred
said
harshly
pro
well
i
hate
to
spoil
it
but
i
not
going
to
tell
where
the
lies
hidden
you
not
getting
that
serum
out
of
me
i
can
have
you
mind
blasted
walton
said
they
pick
your
mind
apart
and
strip
it
away
layer
by
layer
until
they
find
what
they
want
there
wo
be
much
of
left
by
then
but
we
have
the
serum
no
go
not
even
you
can
swing
that
deal
fred
said
you
ca
get
a
permit
on
your
lonesome
you
need
the
president
okay
it
takes
at
least
a
day
to
go
through
channels
half
a
day
if
you
pull
rank
and
by
that
time
roy
i
be
out
of
here
what
you
heard
me
clear
enough
seems
you
holding
me
here
on
pretty
tenuous
grounds
habeas
corpus
has
been
suspended
yet
roy
and
popeek
is
big
enough
to
do
it
i
got
a
writ
i
be
sprung
at
today
i
have
you
back
in
by
walton
said
angrily
we
picking
up
di
cassio
and
that
whole
bunch
that
be
sufficient
grounds
to
quash
your
habeas
corpus
ah
maybe
so
fred
said
but
i
be
out
of
here
for
half
an
hour
that
long
enough
to
let
the
world
know
how
you
exercised
an
illegal
special
privilege
and
spared
philip
prior
from
happysleep
wiggle
out
of
that
one
then
walton
began
to
sweat
fred
had
him
neatly
nailed
this
time
someone
in
security
evidently
had
let
him
sneak
his
plea
out
of
the
keep
martinez
well
it
did
matter
by
fred
would
be
free
and
the
prior
incident
would
be
smeared
all
over
the
telefax
system
that
would
finish
walton
affairs
were
at
too
delicate
an
impasse
for
him
to
risk
having
to
defend
himself
now
fred
might
not
be
able
to
save
himself
but
he
could
certainly
topple
his
brother
there
was
no
possible
way
to
get
a
request
through
before
president
lanson
himself
would
have
to
sign
the
authorization
and
the
old
dodderer
would
take
his
time
about
it
mind
picking
was
out
but
there
was
still
one
weapon
left
to
the
head
of
popeek
if
he
cared
to
use
it
walton
moistened
his
lips
it
sounds
very
neat
he
said
i
ask
you
one
more
time
will
you
yield
lamarre
serum
to
me
for
use
in
my
negotiations
with
the
dirnan
are
you
kidding
no
fred
said
positively
not
to
save
your
life
or
mine
i
got
you
exactly
where
i
want
you
roy
where
i
wanted
you
all
my
life
and
you
ca
wriggle
out
of
it
i
think
you
underestimated
me
again
walton
said
in
a
quiet
voice
and
for
the
last
time
he
stood
up
and
opened
the
door
of
the
room
a
security
man
hovered
outside
will
you
tell
martinez
i
ready
to
leave
walton
said
the
jetcopter
pilot
was
dozing
when
walton
reached
the
landing
stage
walton
woke
him
and
said
let
get
back
to
the
cullen
building
fast
the
trip
took
about
ten
minutes
walton
entered
his
office
signaling
his
return
but
indicating
he
wanted
no
calls
just
yet
carefully
thoughtfully
he
arranged
the
various
strands
of
circumstance
in
his
mind
building
them
into
a
symmetrical
structure
di
cassio
and
the
other
conspirators
would
be
rounded
up
by
nightfall
certainly
but
no
time
element
operated
there
walton
knew
he
could
get
authorizations
in
a
day
or
so
and
go
through
one
after
another
of
them
until
the
whereabouts
of
lamarre
formula
turned
up
it
was
brutal
but
necessary
fred
was
a
different
problem
unless
walton
prevented
it
he
be
freed
on
his
writ
within
hours
and
when
he
revealed
the
prior
incident
it
would
smash
walton
whole
fragile
construct
to
flinders
he
could
fight
habeas
corpus
but
the
director
of
popeek
did
have
one
weapon
that
legally
superseded
all
others
fred
had
gambled
on
his
brother
softness
and
fred
had
lost
walton
reached
for
his
voicewrite
and
in
a
calm
controlled
voice
began
to
dictate
an
order
for
the
immediate
removal
of
frederic
walton
from
security
keep
and
for
his
prompt
transference
to
the
euthanasia
clinic
on
grounds
of
criminal
insanity
xx
even
after
that
for
which
he
felt
no
guilt
only
relief
walton
felt
oppressive
foreboding
hanging
over
him
martinez
phoned
late
that
day
to
inform
him
that
the
hundred
landowners
had
been
duly
corralled
and
were
being
held
in
the
lower
reaches
of
security
keep
they
yelling
and
squalling
martinez
said
and
they
have
plenty
of
legal
authority
down
here
soon
enough
better
have
a
case
against
them
i
obtaining
an
authorization
to
mind
blast
the
one
named
di
cassio
he
the
ringleader
i
think
walton
paused
for
a
moment
then
asked
did
a
popeek
copter
arrive
to
pick
up
frederic
walton
yes
martinez
said
at
a
lawyer
showed
up
here
waving
a
writ
a
little
while
later
but
naturally
we
had
no
further
jurisdiction
the
security
man
eyes
were
cold
and
accusing
but
walton
did
not
flinch
he
repeated
all
right
martinez
thanks
for
your
cooperation
he
blanked
the
screen
he
was
moving
coolly
crisply
now
in
order
to
get
a
authorization
he
would
have
to
see
president
lanson
personally
very
well
he
would
see
president
lanson
the
shrunken
old
man
in
the
white
house
was
openly
deferential
to
the
popeek
head
walton
stated
his
case
quickly
bluntly
watery
mild
eyes
blinked
a
few
times
at
the
many
complexities
of
the
situation
he
rocked
uneasily
up
and
down
finally
he
said
this
mind
picking
it
absolutely
necessary
absolutely
we
must
know
where
that
serum
is
hidden
lanson
sighed
heavily
i
authorize
it
he
said
he
looked
beaten
washington
to
new
york
was
a
matter
of
some
few
minutes
the
precious
authorization
in
his
hands
walton
spoke
to
di
cassio
via
the
screener
setup
at
security
keep
informed
him
of
what
was
going
to
be
done
with
him
then
despite
the
fat
man
hysterical
protests
he
turned
the
authorization
over
to
martinez
with
instructions
to
proceed
with
the
mind
pick
it
took
minutes
walton
waited
in
a
bare
austere
office
somewhere
in
the
keep
while
the
technicians
peeled
away
the
cortex
of
di
cassio
mind
by
now
walton
was
past
all
ambivalence
all
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
mere
robot
fulfilling
a
preset
pattern
of
action
at
martinez
presented
himself
before
walton
the
little
security
head
looked
bleak
it
done
di
cassio
been
reduced
to
blubber
and
bone
i
want
to
watch
another
mind
picking
too
soon
you
may
have
to
walton
said
if
di
cassio
was
the
right
one
i
intend
to
go
straight
down
the
line
on
all
of
them
one
of
them
dealt
with
fred
one
of
them
must
know
where
the
lamarre
papers
are
martinez
shook
his
head
wearily
no
there
wo
need
to
be
any
more
we
got
it
all
out
of
di
cassio
the
transcript
ought
to
be
along
any
moment
as
the
security
man
spoke
an
arrival
bin
in
the
office
flashed
and
a
packet
arrived
walton
broke
impatiently
for
the
bin
but
martinez
waved
him
away
this
is
my
domain
walton
please
be
patient
with
infuriating
slowness
martinez
opened
the
packet
removed
some
sheets
nodded
over
them
he
handed
them
to
walton
here
read
for
yourself
here
the
record
of
the
conversation
between
your
brother
and
di
cassio
i
think
it
what
you
looking
for
walton
accepted
the
sheets
tensely
and
began
to
read
di
cassio
have
a
what
fred
walton
immortality
serum
eternal
life
you
know
some
popeek
scientist
invented
it
and
i
stole
his
notebook
from
my
brother
office
it
all
di
cassio
excellent
work
excellent
immortality
you
say
fred
walton
right
and
it
the
weapon
we
can
use
to
pry
roy
out
of
office
all
i
have
to
do
is
tell
him
he
better
get
out
of
the
way
or
we
turn
the
serum
loose
on
humanity
and
move
he
an
idealist
stars
in
his
eyes
and
all
that
he
dare
di
cassio
is
marvelous
you
will
of
course
send
the
serum
formula
to
us
for
safe
keeping
fred
walton
hell
i
will
i
keeping
those
notes
right
where
they
belong
inside
my
head
i
destroyed
the
notebooks
and
had
the
scientist
killed
the
only
one
who
knows
the
secret
is
yours
truly
this
is
just
to
prevent
on
your
part
di
cassio
not
that
i
do
trust
you
you
di
cassio
my
boy
fred
walton
of
that
stuff
you
gave
me
a
free
hand
try
to
interfere
walton
let
the
transcript
slip
from
his
numb
hands
to
the
floor
my
god
he
said
softly
my
god
martinez
bright
eyes
flicked
from
walton
to
the
scattered
papers
on
the
floor
what
the
trouble
you
got
fred
in
your
custody
have
you
did
you
read
the
order
i
sent
you
martinez
chuckled
hollowly
well
yes
it
was
a
happysleep
authorization
but
i
thought
it
was
just
a
way
of
avoiding
that
writ
i
mean
your
own
man
that
was
no
dodge
walton
said
that
was
a
happysleep
order
and
i
meant
it
really
unless
there
was
a
fred
went
to
the
chamber
four
hours
ago
and
said
walton
he
took
the
lamarre
formula
along
with
him
alone
in
his
office
in
the
cullen
building
walton
stared
at
his
own
distorted
reflection
mirrored
in
the
opaqued
windows
on
his
desk
lay
the
slip
of
paper
bearing
the
names
of
those
who
had
gone
to
happysleep
in
the
gassing
frederic
walton
was
the
fourth
name
on
the
list
for
once
there
had
been
no
walton
thought
back
over
the
events
of
the
last
nine
days
one
of
his
earliest
realizations
during
that
time
had
been
that
the
head
of
popeek
held
powers
of
life
and
death
over
humanity
godlike
he
had
assumed
both
responsibilities
he
had
granted
life
to
philip
prior
that
had
been
the
start
of
this
chain
of
events
and
the
first
of
his
many
mistakes
now
he
had
given
death
to
frederic
walton
an
act
in
itself
justifiable
but
in
consequence
the
most
massive
of
his
errors
all
his
scheming
had
come
to
naught
any
help
now
would
have
to
come
from
without
wearily
he
snapped
on
the
phone
and
asked
for
a
connection
to
nairobi
the
interstellar
swap
would
have
to
be
canceled
walton
was
unable
to
deliver
the
goods
fred
would
have
the
final
smirk
yet
some
minutes
later
he
got
through
to
mcleod
i
glad
you
called
mcleod
said
immediately
i
been
trying
to
reach
you
all
day
the
dirnan
getting
rather
impatient
this
low
gravity
is
making
him
sick
and
he
wants
to
get
going
back
to
his
home
world
let
me
talk
to
him
he
be
able
to
leave
right
away
mcleod
nodded
and
vanished
from
the
screen
the
alien
visage
of
thogran
klayrn
appeared
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
the
dirnan
said
you
promised
to
call
earlier
today
you
did
not
i
sorry
about
that
walton
told
him
i
was
trying
to
locate
the
papers
to
turn
over
to
you
ah
yes
has
it
been
done
no
walton
said
the
serum
does
exist
any
more
the
man
who
invented
it
is
dead
and
so
is
the
only
other
man
who
knew
the
formula
there
was
a
moment
of
startled
silence
then
the
dirnan
said
you
assured
me
delivery
of
the
information
i
know
but
it
ca
be
delivered
walton
was
silent
a
long
while
brooding
the
deal
off
there
was
a
and
the
man
who
had
the
data
was
was
inadvertently
executed
today
you
say
yes
it
was
an
error
on
my
part
a
foolish
blunder
that
is
irrelevant
the
alien
interrupted
peevishly
is
the
body
still
intact
why
yes
walton
said
taken
off
guard
he
wondered
what
plan
the
alien
had
it
in
our
morgue
right
now
but
the
alien
turned
away
from
the
screen
and
walton
heard
him
conferring
with
someone
beyond
the
field
of
vision
then
the
dirnan
returned
there
are
techniques
for
recovering
information
from
newly
dead
persons
thogran
klayrn
said
you
have
none
of
these
on
earth
recovering
information
walton
stammered
no
we
do
these
techniques
exist
have
you
such
a
device
as
an
electroencephalograph
on
earth
of
course
then
it
is
still
possible
to
extract
the
data
from
this
dead
brain
the
alien
uttered
a
wistful
wheeze
see
that
the
body
comes
to
no
harm
i
will
be
at
your
city
shortly
for
a
moment
walton
did
not
understand
then
he
thought
course
it
had
to
happen
this
he
realized
the
rent
in
the
fabric
had
been
bound
up
his
mistakes
undone
his
conscience
granted
a
reprieve
he
felt
absurdly
grateful
that
all
his
striving
should
have
been
ruined
at
the
last
moment
would
have
been
intolerable
now
all
was
made
whole
thanks
he
said
with
sudden
fervor
thanks
may
roy
walton
director
of
the
bureau
of
population
equalization
stood
sweltering
in
the
sun
at
nairobi
spaceport
watching
the
smiling
people
file
past
him
into
the
towering
ship
a
man
holding
a
small
child
in
his
arms
came
up
to
him
hello
walton
he
said
in
a
majestic
basso
walton
turned
startled
prior
he
exclaimed
after
a
fumbling
and
this
is
my
son
philip
said
prior
we
both
be
going
as
colonists
my
wife
already
aboard
but
i
just
wanted
to
thank
you
walton
looked
at
the
happy
boy
there
was
a
medical
exam
for
all
volunteer
colonists
how
did
you
get
the
boy
through
time
legitimately
prior
said
grinning
he
a
perfectly
healthy
normal
boy
that
potential
tb
condition
was
just
that
potential
philip
got
an
health
clearance
so
it
new
earth
and
the
wide
ranges
for
the
prior
family
i
glad
for
you
walton
said
absently
i
wish
i
could
go
why
ca
you
too
much
work
here
walton
said
if
you
turn
out
any
poetry
up
there
i
like
to
see
it
prior
shook
his
head
i
have
a
feeling
i
be
too
busy
really
just
a
substitute
for
living
i
getting
to
think
i
be
too
busy
up
there
to
write
anything
maybe
said
walton
i
suppose
you
right
but
you
better
move
along
that
ship
due
to
blast
pretty
soon
right
thanks
again
for
everything
prior
said
and
he
and
the
child
moved
on
walton
watched
them
go
he
thought
back
over
the
past
year
he
thought
made
one
right
guess
the
boy
deserved
to
the
loading
continued
one
thousand
colonists
would
go
this
first
trip
and
a
thousand
more
the
next
day
and
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
more
until
a
billion
of
earth
multitudes
were
on
the
new
world
there
was
a
great
deal
of
paperwork
involved
in
transporting
a
billion
people
through
space
walton
desk
groaned
with
a
backlog
of
work
he
glanced
up
no
stars
were
visible
of
course
in
the
midday
sky
but
he
knew
that
new
earth
was
out
there
somewhere
and
near
it
dirna
he
thought
have
learned
to
control
our
growth
and
that
will
be
the
day
the
dirnans
give
us
back
our
immortality
a
warning
siren
sounded
suddenly
and
ship
number
one
sprang
up
from
earth
hovered
for
a
few
instants
on
a
red
pillar
of
fire
and
vanished
director
walton
looked
blankly
at
the
place
where
the
ship
had
been
and
after
a
moment
turned
away
plenty
of
work
waited
for
him
back
in
new
york
