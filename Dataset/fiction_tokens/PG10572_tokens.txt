ship
company
by
jacobs
manners
makyth
man
the
appeared
to
be
out
of
sorts
his
movements
were
even
slower
than
usual
and
when
he
sat
the
seemed
to
be
unable
to
give
satisfaction
his
face
bore
an
expression
of
deep
melancholy
but
a
smouldering
gleam
in
his
eye
betokened
feelings
deeply
moved
i
do
hold
with
he
burst
out
with
sudden
ferocity
never
did
i
do
say
i
ai
been
to
a
theayter
once
or
twice
in
my
life
but
i
always
come
away
with
the
idea
that
anybody
could
act
if
they
liked
to
try
it
a
kid
game
a
silly
kid
game
dressing
up
and
pretending
to
be
somebody
else
he
cut
off
a
piece
of
tobacco
and
stowing
it
in
his
left
cheek
sat
chewing
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
wharves
across
the
river
the
offensive
antics
of
a
lighterman
in
who
nearly
fell
overboard
in
his
efforts
to
attract
his
attention
he
ignored
i
might
ha
known
it
too
he
said
after
a
long
silence
if
i
only
stopped
to
think
instead
o
being
in
such
a
hurry
to
do
good
to
others
i
should
ha
been
all
right
and
the
pack
o
swabs
on
the
i
lizzie
and
annie
wot
calls
themselves
would
had
to
got
something
else
to
laugh
about
they
told
it
in
every
pub
for
a
mile
round
and
last
night
when
i
went
into
the
town
of
margate
to
get
a
drink
three
chaps
climbed
over
the
partition
to
a
look
at
me
it
all
began
with
young
ted
sawyer
the
mate
o
the
i
lizzie
and
annie
he
calls
himself
a
mate
but
if
it
was
for
the
skipper
for
a
be
called
something
else
very
quick
two
or
three
times
we
words
over
one
thing
and
another
and
the
last
time
i
called
something
that
i
can
see
now
was
a
mistake
it
was
one
these
clever
things
that
a
man
do
forget
let
alone
a
monkey
like
that
was
when
they
was
up
time
afore
last
and
when
they
made
fast
last
week
i
could
see
as
he
forgotten
it
for
one
thing
he
pretended
not
to
see
me
and
arter
i
told
him
wot
i
do
to
him
if
ran
into
me
agin
he
said
thought
i
was
a
sack
o
potatoes
taking
a
airing
on
a
pair
of
legs
wot
somebody
throwed
away
nasty
tongue
got
not
clever
but
nasty
arter
that
i
took
no
notice
of
and
o
course
that
annoyed
more
than
anything
all
i
could
do
i
done
and
was
ringing
the
that
night
from
five
minutes
to
twelve
till
afore
i
heard
it
many
a
gets
a
name
for
going
to
sleep
when
only
getting
a
bit
of
own
back
we
stood
there
talking
for
over
arter
i
in
leastways
he
did
and
whenever
i
see
as
he
was
getting
tired
i
just
said
and
start
agin
as
fresh
as
ever
he
tumbled
to
it
at
last
and
went
aboard
shaking
little
fist
at
me
and
telling
me
wot
he
do
to
me
if
it
was
for
the
lor
i
kept
by
the
gate
as
soon
as
i
came
on
dooty
next
evening
just
to
give
a
little
smile
as
went
out
there
is
nothing
more
aggravating
than
a
smile
when
it
is
properly
done
but
there
was
no
signs
o
my
lord
and
arter
practising
it
on
a
carman
by
mistake
i
to
go
inside
for
a
bit
and
wait
till
he
gorn
the
coast
was
clear
by
the
time
i
went
back
and
i
just
stepped
outside
with
my
back
up
agin
the
to
a
pipe
when
i
see
a
boy
coming
along
with
a
bag
lad
of
about
fifteen
was
nicely
dressed
in
a
serge
suit
and
he
no
sooner
gets
up
to
me
than
puts
down
the
bag
and
looks
up
at
me
with
a
timid
sort
o
little
smile
evening
he
ses
he
was
the
fust
that
has
made
that
mistake
older
people
than
have
done
it
evening
my
lad
i
ses
he
ses
in
a
trembling
voice
suppose
you
ai
looking
out
for
a
sir
i
ses
i
ai
run
away
from
to
go
to
sea
he
ses
and
i
afraid
of
being
pursued
can
i
come
inside
afore
i
could
say
he
come
bag
and
all
and
afore
i
could
say
anything
else
he
nipped
into
the
office
and
stood
there
with
his
on
his
chest
panting
know
i
can
trust
you
he
ses
can
see
it
by
your
face
you
run
away
from
for
i
ses
they
been
of
you
me
he
ses
with
a
laugh
much
why
i
expect
my
father
is
running
about
all
over
the
place
offering
rewards
for
me
he
would
lose
me
for
a
thousand
pounds
i
pricked
up
my
ears
at
that
i
do
deny
it
anybody
would
besides
i
knew
it
would
be
doing
him
a
kindness
to
hand
back
to
father
and
then
i
did
a
bit
o
thinking
to
see
it
was
to
be
done
down
i
ses
putting
three
or
four
ledgers
on
the
floor
behind
one
of
the
desks
down
and
let
talk
it
over
we
talked
away
for
ever
so
long
but
do
all
i
would
i
persuade
his
was
stuffed
full
of
coral
islands
and
smugglers
and
pirates
and
foreign
ports
he
said
wanted
to
see
the
world
and
love
the
blue
billers
he
ses
heaving
blue
billers
is
wot
i
want
i
tried
to
explain
to
who
would
be
doing
the
heaving
but
would
listen
to
me
he
sat
on
them
ledgers
like
a
little
wooden
image
looking
up
at
me
and
shaking
his
and
when
i
told
of
storms
and
shipwrecks
he
just
smacked
lips
and
his
blue
eyes
shone
with
joy
arter
a
time
i
saw
it
was
no
good
trying
to
persuade
and
i
pretended
to
give
way
think
i
can
get
you
a
ship
with
a
friend
o
mine
i
ses
mind
i
got
to
relieve
your
pore
father

must
let
know

of
you
before

sailed
he
ses
very
quick
not
i
ses
you
must
give
me
name
and
address
and
arter
the
blue
shark
that
the
name
of
your
ship
is
clear
of
the
land
i
send
a
letter
with
no
name
to
it
saying
where
you
ave
gorn
he
did
seem
to
like
it
at
fust
and
said
would
write
but
arter
i
pointed
out
that
might
forget
and
that
i
was
responsible
gave
way
and
told
me
that
father
was
named
watson
and
he
kept
a
big
draper
shop
in
the
commercial
road
we
talked
a
bit
arter
that
just
to
stop
suspicions
and
then
i
told
to
stay
where
was
on
the
floor
out
of
sight
of
the
window
while
i
went
to
see
my
friend
the
captain

stood
outside
for
a
moment
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
wot
to
do
i
no
business
strictly
speaking
to
leave
the
wharf
but
on
the
other
there
was
a
father
to
relieve
i
edged
along
bit
by
bit
while
i
was
thinking
and
then
arter
looking
back
once
or
twice
to
make
sure
that
the
boy
was
watching
me
i
set
off
for
the
commercial
road

hard
as
i
could
go

a
warm
evening
and
i

to

all
the
way
and
by
the
time

got
there
i
was
melted

three
or
four
gals
behind

counter
and
things
like

he
told
me
to

bit

time

at
last
i

back
and

myself
into
the
office
as
i
expected
it
was
empty
there
was
no
sign
of
either
the
gal
or
the
boy
and
i
dropped
into
a
chair
and
tried
to
think
wot
it
all
meant
then
to
look
out
of
the
winder
i
see
somebody
running
up
and
down
the
jetty

owing
to
the
things
in
the
way

as
soon
as
i
got
outside
and
saw
who
it
was
i
nearly
dropped
it
was
the
boy
and
he
was
running
up
and
down
wringing
his
and
crying
like
a
wild
thing
and
instead
o
running
away
as
soon
as
saw
me
he
rushed
right
up
to
me
and
threw
grubby
little
paws
round
my
neck

overboard

ses
dancing
about
my
pore
sister

ran
to
the
side
and
pointed
at
the
water
which

just
about
at
then
caught
of
me
agin
he
ses
giving
me
a
shove
behind

there
for
a
moment
dazed
looking
down
at
the
water
then
i
pulled
down
a
from

wall
and
threw
it
in
and
arter
another
moment

out
as

ses
the
cook
i
was
the
pore
gal
i
haunt
ses
the
ordinary
seaman
night
of
life
i
stand
afore
dripping
with
water
and
moaning
she
will
ses
the
cook
so
at
any
rate
i
did
answer
i
was
too
besides
which
i
got
a
of
ghosts
and
the
idea
of
being
on
the
wharf
alone
of
a
night
arter
such
a
thing
was
too
much
for
me
i
went
on
board
the
i
lizzie
and
annie
and
down
in
the
cabin
i
found
a
bottle
o
whisky
as
the
skipper
said
i
sat
down
on
the
locker
and
a
glass
and
then
i
sat
worrying
and
wondering
wot
was
to
be
the
end
of
it
all
the
whisky
warmed
me
up
a
bit
and
i
just
taken
up
the
bottle
to
myself
agin
when
i
a
faint
sort
o
sound
in
the
i
put
the
bottle
down
and
listened
but
everything
seemed
deathly
still
i
took
it
up
agin
and
just
poured
out
a
drop
whisky
when
i
distinctly
a
hissing
noise
and
then
a
little
moan
for
a
moment
i
sat
turned
to
stone
then
i
put
the
bottle
down
quiet
and
just
got
up
to
go
when
the
door
of
the
opened
and
i
saw
the
drownded
gal
with
little
face
and
hair
all
wet
and
dripping
standing
before
me
ted
sawyer
been
telling
everybody
that
i
came
up
the
like
a
that
lost
its
ma
i
wonder
how
he
come
up
if
he
the
evening
i
had
they
were
all
on
the
jetty
as
i
got
there
and
tumbled
into
the
arms
and
all
asking
at
once
wot
was
the
matter
when
i
got
my
breath
back
a
bit
and
told
they
laughed
all
except
the
cook
and
said
it
was
only
wot
i
might
expect
then
like
a
man
in
a
dream
i
see
the
gal
come
out
of
the
companion
and
walk
slowly
to
the
side
i
ses
there
she
is
dreaming
ses
the
skipper
nothing
there
they
all
said
the
same
even
when
the
gal
stepped
on
to
the
side
and
climbed
on
to
the
wharf
she
came
along
towards
me
with
arms
held
close
to
sides
and
making
the
most
faces
at
me
and
it
took
five
all
their
time
to
me
the
wharf
and
everything
seemed
to
me
to
spin
round
and
round
then
she
came
straight
up
to
me
and
patted
me
on
the
cheek
old
gentleman
she
ses
a
shame
it
is
ted
it
too
bad
they
let
go
o
me
then
and
stamped
up
and
down
the
jetty
laughing
fit
to
kill
themselves
if
they
only
known
wot
a
exhibition
they
was
making
of
themselves
and
i
pitied
them
they
would
ha
done
it
and
by
and
by
ted
wiped
his
eyes
and
put
his
arm
round
the
gal
waist
and
ses
is
my
intended
miss
florrie
price
he
ses
she
a
little
wonder
wot
d
think
of
keep
my
own
opinion
i
ses
ai
got
nothing
to
say
against
gals
but
if
i
only
lay
my
hands
on
that
young
brother
of
they
went
off
agin
then
worse
than
ever
and
at
last
the
cook
came
and
put
skinny
arm
round
my
neck
and
started
spluttering
in
my
ear
i
shoved
off
hard
because
i
see
it
all
then
and
i
should
ha
seen
it
afore
only
i
did
time
to
think
i
do
bear
no
malice
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
do
wish
any
harder
punishment
than
to
be
married
to
ted
sawyer
