chapter
i
tells
you
how
we
got
started
maybe
you
fellows
will
remember
about
how
i
was
telling
you
that
our
troop
had
a
that
was
loaned
to
us
for
the
summer
by
a
man
that
lives
out
our
way
he
said
we
could
fix
it
up
and
use
it
to
go
to
temple
camp
in
it
was
a
peach
of
a
boat
and
took
the
hills
fine
that
what
we
said
just
to
jolly
harris
who
is
in
our
troop
he
awfully
easy
to
jolly
but
he
does
stay
mad
long
that
one
good
thing
about
him
but
one
trouble
that
boat
did
have
any
power
and
it
would
even
drift
right
on
account
of
being
almost
square
westy
martin
said
it
was
on
the
square
all
right
he
a
crazy
kid
that
fellow
is
anyway
the
boat
did
have
any
power
our
scoutmaster
ellsworth
said
it
did
even
have
any
will
power
we
could
even
pole
it
when
we
first
got
it
it
was
way
up
a
creek
in
the
marshes
and
donnelle
he
the
man
that
owned
it
took
us
there
and
showed
it
to
us
just
as
we
were
coming
near
it
a
fellow
jumped
out
of
it
and
ran
away
through
the
marshes
we
said
he
must
be
a
tramp
because
he
was
all
ragged
anyway
he
acted
as
if
he
was
scared
that
was
one
sure
thing
we
should
worry
about
him
anyway
i
said
and
donnelle
said
he
was
gone
and
that
was
the
end
of
him
but
believe
me
that
was
the
end
of
him
that
was
only
the
beginning
of
him
i
did
say
anything
more
about
him
before
because
i
did
know
but
believe
me
that
fellow
was
what
do
you
call
it
you
know
to
cause
a
lot
of
trouble
in
our
young
lives
that
sounds
like
a
regular
author
hey
when
we
began
fixing
the
boat
up
we
found
that
one
of
the
lockers
was
locked
with
a
padlock
and
as
long
as
the
boat
did
belong
to
us
we
did
break
it
open
especially
because
there
were
plenty
of
lockers
besides
that
one
i
bet
you
like
to
know
what
was
in
that
locker
but
you
not
going
to
find
that
out
yet
so
there
no
use
asking
all
the
time
we
thought
donnelle
had
the
key
to
it
but
oh
just
you
wait
well
after
we
got
it
all
fixed
up
we
could
decide
how
we
get
it
down
into
the
bay
and
then
up
the
hudson
to
catskill
landing
where
you
have
to
go
to
get
to
temple
camp
temple
camp
is
a
great
big
scout
camp
and
it
right
on
the
shore
of
black
lake
oh
it
peachy
you
see
it
all
right
and
you
see
jeb
rushmore
he
camp
manager
he
used
to
be
a
trapper
out
west
you
see
us
all
around
you
wait
ellsworth
says
this
story
is
all
right
so
far
only
to
go
on
about
the
boat
gee
i
go
faster
than
the
boat
did
that
one
sure
thing
leave
it
to
me
but
after
we
got
down
into
the
hudson
we
went
fast
all
right
let
see
where
was
i
oh
yes
we
were
wondering
how
we
get
to
camp
in
it
because
we
have
much
money
in
our
troop
on
account
of
being
broke
poor
but
honest
hey
and
it
costs
a
lot
of
money
to
be
towed
and
an
engine
would
cost
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
nix
on
the
engine
you
can
bet
but
oh
boy
there
one
thing
ellsworth
said
and
it
true
got
to
admit
that
he
said
that
good
turns
are
good
investments
he
says
they
pay
a
hundred
percent
that
even
better
than
liberty
bonds
you
do
get
it
back
in
money
but
you
get
it
back
in
fun
what
the
difference
well
we
did
a
good
turn
and
oh
believe
me
there
was
come
back
one
day
a
tug
came
up
our
river
on
its
way
up
to
north
bridgeboro
that
where
the
mill
is
and
there
was
anybody
there
to
open
the
bridge
so
it
could
get
through
oh
was
that
old
tug
captain
mad
he
kept
whistling
and
whistling
and
saying
things
about
the
river
being
an
old
mud
hole
and
how
he
never
get
down
the
bay
again
unless
he
could
get
through
and
come
down
on
the
full
tide
oh
boy
but
he
was
wild
when
we
told
him
that
old
uncle
jimmy
the
bridge
tender
had
sneaked
away
to
a
grand
army
convention
he
kind
of
cooled
down
on
account
of
being
an
old
veteran
himself
and
then
some
of
us
fellows
fished
up
an
old
that
had
been
lost
in
the
river
and
opened
the
bridge
with
it
that
what
they
call
the
thing
you
open
the
bridge
with
a
it
like
a
only
different
i
not
saying
that
was
so
much
of
a
good
turn
except
it
was
turning
the
bridge
around
and
connie
bennett
said
that
was
a
good
turn
the
troop
anyway
old
captain
savage
took
me
up
to
north
bridgeboro
with
him
and
first
i
was
kind
of
scared
of
him
because
he
had
a
big
red
face
and
he
was
awful
gruff
but
wait
till
you
hear
about
the
fun
we
had
with
him
when
we
landed
and
took
a
peek
at
peekskill
oh
boy
then
he
said
how
he
liked
the
way
we
stood
up
for
uncle
jimmy
and
i
guess
besides
he
was
glad
about
me
diving
and
getting
the
but
anyway
that
was
easy
so
he
said
he
was
going
to
tow
us
up
as
far
as
poughkeepsie
the
next
saturday
and
that
if
we
refused
on
account
of
scouts
not
being
willing
to
accept
anything
for
a
service
he
make
a
lot
of
trouble
for
uncle
jimmy
because
he
was
away
he
was
only
fooling
when
he
said
that
maybe
you
wo
like
him
in
the
beginning
but
you
get
to
like
him
pretty
soon
so
that
how
we
got
it
all
fixed
to
go
to
camp
or
part
of
the
way
anyway
in
the
and
believe
me
we
had
some
trip
and
mostly
what
i
going
to
tell
you
all
about
talk
about
fun
on
saturday
morning
all
of
the
troop
came
down
to
the
ready
for
the
trip
and
oh
you
ought
to
have
seen
skinny
mccord
he
a
little
fellow
that
lives
down
in
the
poor
part
of
town
and
he
was
a
new
member
his
mother
is
poor
and
she
goes
out
washing
and
skinny
was
sick
and
his
clothes
were
all
in
rags
and
even
he
did
have
any
shoes
and
stockings
but
anyway
he
did
me
a
good
turn
and
so
westy
martin
and
i
got
him
into
the
troop
and
we
presented
him
to
the
elk
patrol
because
they
had
a
vacant
place
on
account
of
tom
slade
being
away
in
france
so
now
you
know
about
skinny
and
you
find
out
a
lot
more
about
him
too
before
saturday
came
ellsworth
made
a
bargain
with
sandy
grober
to
tow
us
down
into
the
kill
von
kull
that
near
staten
island
you
know
sandy
has
a
boat
with
a
heavy
duty
motor
in
it
and
he
said
do
the
job
for
ten
dollars
because
anyway
he
go
to
princess
bay
fishing
our
troop
was
broke
and
we
could
spare
the
money
because
we
needed
all
we
had
for
eats
and
things
so
this
is
the
way
we
fixed
it
ellsworth
gave
sandy
the
ten
dollars
and
then
each
one
of
the
patrol
leaders
gave
ellsworth
a
note
saying
his
patrol
would
pay
back
two
dollars
and
a
half
as
soon
as
they
earned
it
that
would
make
seven
dollars
and
a
half
and
ellsworth
said
he
would
pay
the
other
two
fifty
himself
so
you
see
it
was
all
divided
up
even
between
the
patrols
and
the
scoutmaster
believe
me
we
had
some
fun
earning
that
money
especially
the
raving
ravens
that
the
raven
patrol
you
know
we
started
early
saturday
morning
and
we
knew
just
where
we
had
to
go
because
we
had
a
letter
from
captain
savage
saying
that
we
should
wait
in
the
anchorage
off
george
at
staten
island
until
he
came
and
got
us
he
said
maybe
it
would
be
sunday
night
or
maybe
monday
morning
but
anyway
just
to
ride
on
our
anchor
till
he
came
we
did
have
any
adventures
going
down
our
river
and
i
wo
bother
telling
you
about
it
because
it
would
only
be
slow
gee
williger
a
story
that
being
towed
against
the
tide
would
have
much
action
would
it
i
bet
you
skip
so
it
better
for
to
skip
than
for
hey
but
anyway
on
the
way
down
we
got
the
boat
all
straightened
out
inside
and
decided
just
how
we
sleep
two
patrols
would
sleep
in
the
two
rooms
and
one
patrol
on
deck
under
the
awning
and
we
decided
we
take
turns
that
way
so
each
patrol
would
get
some
sleeping
outdoors
we
did
get
to
the
kill
von
kull
till
about
five
and
i
guess
it
was
about
six
when
we
got
to
george
oh
but
there
are
some
peachy
boats
in
the
anchorage
there
regular
yachts
and
big
cabin
cruisers
and
that
where
our
adventures
began
you
can
bet
do
you
like
mysteries
gee
that
one
thing
i
crazy
about
mysteries
mysteries
and
pineapple
sodas
oh
oh
then
sandy
left
us
and
went
off
to
catch
fish
cod
fish
oh
boy
but
it
was
fine
rocking
away
out
there
pretty
soon
i
got
supper
because
i
cook
i
know
how
to
make
flapjacks
and
hunters
stew
and
a
lot
of
things
after
supper
the
fellows
decided
to
go
ashore
to
george
and
get
some
sodas
and
take
in
a
movie
show
i
said
i
stay
on
the
houseboat
because
i
had
to
write
up
the
maybe
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
i
troop
historian
most
of
the
things
in
this
story
are
out
of
our
troop
book
you
better
not
skip
the
next
chapter
because
something
is
going
to
happen
chapter
ii
tells
you
how
i
had
a
visitor
we
were
anchored
very
far
from
shore
so
it
did
take
long
for
all
the
troop
to
row
over
even
though
we
only
had
one
small
boat
ellsworth
went
with
them
so
he
could
look
after
skinny
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
clearing
up
after
supper
i
got
out
the
troop
book
and
began
writing
it
up
i
was
behind
about
two
weeks
with
it
and
so
i
had
about
ten
pages
to
do
oh
but
it
was
dandy
sitting
there
on
the
deck
with
my
feet
up
on
the
railing
writing
i
mean
i
was
writing
with
my
hand
pretty
soon
it
began
getting
dark
and
i
could
see
the
lights
coming
out
on
all
the
different
boats
just
like
stars
it
kind
of
fun
being
alone
sometimes
i
could
see
all
the
lights
in
the
town
too
but
what
did
i
care
i
said
i
rather
be
alone
where
i
was
pretty
soon
it
was
too
dark
to
write
and
so
i
just
sat
there
thinking
maybe
you
think
it
no
fun
just
thinking
but
i
was
thinking
how
pretty
soon
we
be
hiking
up
from
catskill
landing
to
black
lake
and
how
i
see
jeb
rushmore
and
how
i
take
a
hike
and
find
out
if
the
robin
nest
was
just
where
it
was
last
year
that
robin
is
a
member
of
our
patrol
he
an
honorary
member
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
it
was
pitch
dark
and
i
could
see
any
boats
at
all
only
lights
moving
a
little
on
account
of
the
boats
rocking
in
a
little
while
i
heard
oars
splashing
and
the
sound
seemed
to
be
coming
nearer
and
nearer
so
i
knew
it
was
the
first
of
fellows
coming
back
i
thought
it
was
awful
soon
for
them
to
be
getting
back
it
seemed
funny
that
they
were
talking
especially
if
it
was
the
raving
ravens
that
what
we
call
the
raven
patrol
because
harris
would
be
sure
to
be
running
on
high
that
the
way
he
always
does
especially
coming
home
from
the
movies
and
if
it
was
the
elk
patrol
i
be
sure
to
hear
bert
mcalpin
because
he
a
human
victrola
record
pretty
soon
i
could
make
out
a
black
spot
coming
nearer
and
then
i
knew
for
sure
it
was
headed
for
the
but
there
was
any
sound
except
the
splashing
of
the
oars
and
i
thought
that
was
mighty
funny
in
a
couple
of
minutes
the
boat
came
alongside
and
i
heard
someone
say
very
quiet
like
i
went
and
looked
over
the
rail
and
there
i
saw
a
fellow
all
alone
in
a
rowboat
i
could
see
him
very
well
but
i
could
see
he
had
on
an
old
hat
and
was
pretty
shabby
then
he
sort
of
whispered
anybody
up
there
skeezeks
i
told
him
no
and
asked
him
who
he
was
and
what
he
wanted
but
he
did
say
anything
only
tied
his
boat
and
climbed
up
over
the
rail
then
i
could
see
him
better
by
the
light
shining
through
the
cabin
window
and
his
clothes
were
all
ragged
and
greasy
he
looked
pretty
tough
but
one
thing
anyway
he
smiled
an
awful
nice
kind
of
a
smile
and
hit
me
a
whack
on
the
shoulder
and
said
do
get
excited
skeezeks
you
all
right
and
i
wo
hurt
you
how
are
you
anyway
i
told
him
i
was
very
well
but
i
like
for
him
please
to
tell
me
who
he
was
so
i
know
then
he
gave
me
another
push
and
i
do
know
there
was
something
about
him
that
kind
of
made
me
like
him
and
i
was
scared
of
him
at
all
do
you
know
who
i
am
he
said
i
kind
of
think
maybe
you
the
fellow
that
jumped
out
of
this
boat
and
ran
away
when
it
was
up
the
creek
near
little
valley
you
look
kind
of
like
him
right
the
first
time
he
said
and
i
bet
you
a
bully
little
scout
what
do
you
say
then
he
looked
out
over
the
water
to
be
sure
nobody
was
coming
i
a
first
class
scout
and
i
got
nine
merit
badges
and
i
a
patrol
leader
i
told
him
anyway
i
like
to
know
what
you
want
here
leader
no
he
said
and
i
could
see
he
was
only
trying
to
get
on
the
right
side
of
me
and
that
he
did
know
what
a
patrol
leader
is
at
all
can
patrol
leaders
keep
secrets
he
said
i
told
him
if
it
was
a
good
secret
they
could
then
he
hit
me
a
good
whack
on
the
shoulder
and
he
winked
at
me
awful
funny
and
said
they
are
fools
who
go
and
tell
wisely
has
the
poet
sung
man
may
hold
all
sorts
of
jobs
if
he
only
hold
his
tongue
are
you
a
tramp
i
asked
him
tramp
he
said
that
pretty
good
i
dare
say
i
look
like
one
then
he
jumped
up
on
the
railing
and
began
laughing
so
hard
i
was
afraid
he
fall
backwards
into
the
water
i
told
him
he
better
look
out
but
he
only
laughed
more
and
said
i
was
a
great
kid
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
happened
to
think
and
he
looked
around
to
see
if
anyone
was
coming
then
he
said
are
you
game
to
help
me
in
a
dark
plot
gee
i
did
know
what
to
tell
him
it
depends
upon
how
dark
it
is
i
said
because
jiminy
i
wanted
to
be
careful
and
watch
my
step
but
that
only
made
him
laugh
a
lot
then
he
said
well
it
is
exactly
a
black
plot
but
it
a
kind
of
a
dark
brown
one
thing
sure
i
said
you
not
a
tramp
i
know
that
i
can
tell
you
a
wise
little
gazabo
he
said
would
you
really
like
to
know
who
i
am
i
told
him
sure
i
would
do
you
think
i
look
like
a
tramp
he
asked
me
i
think
you
kind
of
look
like
one
i
said
but
you
do
act
like
one
and
you
do
laugh
like
one
i
got
blamed
little
reason
to
laugh
he
said
because
i
in
dutch
and
you
got
to
do
me
a
good
turn
will
you
good
turns
are
our
middle
names
i
told
him
but
anyway
i
like
to
know
who
you
are
that
sure
then
he
said
i
lieutenant
donnelle
donnelle
son
and
i
guess
i
had
a
right
to
run
away
from
the
boat
did
i
night
i
said
chapter
iii
tells
how
i
made
a
promise
then
he
said
were
you
one
of
the
kids
who
were
coming
along
with
my
father
when
i
jumped
out
of
the
boat
and
i
told
him
yes
then
he
said
you
do
think
he
saw
me
do
you
i
said
yes
he
saw
you
but
i
guess
he
did
know
who
you
were
he
did
see
your
face
that
sure
thank
goodness
for
that
he
said
because
i
caused
the
old
gent
a
lot
of
trouble
anyway
i
told
him
i
do
see
why
you
do
wear
your
uniform
gee
if
i
had
a
lieutenant
uniform
you
bet
i
wear
it
would
you
he
said
and
he
began
to
laugh
then
he
said
well
now
let
sit
down
here
on
this
bench
and
i
tell
you
what
going
to
do
and
then
i
tell
you
what
going
to
do
and
we
have
to
be
quick
about
it
then
he
looked
out
over
the
water
and
listened
and
as
soon
as
he
was
sure
nobody
was
coming
he
put
his
arm
over
my
shoulder
and
made
me
sit
down
on
the
bench
beside
him
i
have
to
admit
i
kind
of
liked
that
fellow
even
though
i
kind
of
thought
he
was
you
know
wild
sort
of
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
the
kind
of
a
fellow
to
have
a
lot
of
adventures
and
to
be
reckless
and
all
that
maybe
you
can
tell
me
what
you
going
to
do
i
told
him
but
you
ca
tell
me
what
going
to
do
that
one
sure
thing
oh
yes
i
can
he
said
because
you
a
bully
kid
and
you
an
sport
and
you
and
i
are
going
to
be
pals
what
do
you
say

ca

me
a
crack
on
the
back
and
he
put
his
arm
around
my
shoulder
awful
nice
and
friendly
like
and
it
made
me
kind
of
proud
because
i

arm
around
my
shoulder
and
every
minute
or
so
listening
and
looking
out
over
the
water
here
something

he
said

a
hop
skip
and
a
jump
off

then
he
hit
me
a
good
rap
on
the
shoulder
and
said
so
you
see
how
it
was
kiddo
instead
of
going
home
to
hear
how
handsome
i
looked
i
just
beat
it
up
that
creek
and
fished
this
suit
of
greasy
rags
out
of
one
of
the
lockers
there
was
a
key
in
the
padlock
and
i
just
took
off
my
uniform
and
stuffed
it
in
the
locker
and
beat
it
over
to
little
landing
in
bridgeboro
you
locked
the
padlock
and
took
the
key
did
you
i
said

he
said
and
i
thought
i

back
that
same
night
and

then
he
went
over
to
the
railing
and
looked
all
around
in
a
hurry
i
guess
they
wo
be
back
for
an
hour
yet
i
told
him
they
went
to
the
movies
so
he
came
back
and
sat
down
beside
me
again
and
began
talking
very
excited
as
if
i
was
kind
of
a
friend
of
his
the
way
he
talked

would
be
glad
to
be
a

that
sure
even

kind
of
reckless
and

robinson
crusoe

last
week
has
been
a
whole
sea
story
in
itself

one
escape
after
another
ever

like
a
church

going
to
tell
you

some
night
around
the
i
tell

he
said
we
were
fishing
off
sea
gate
and
the
fish
just
stood
on
line
waiting
for
a
chance
to
bite
we
sold
three
boatfuls
in
the
one
day
and
whacked
up
about
seventy
dollars
what
do
you
think
of
that
then
we
chugged
around
into
coney
for
gas
and
on
the
way
back
we
got
mussed
up
with
the
tide
and
were
carried
out
to
sea
banged
around
for
three
days
bailing
and
trying
to
fry
fish
on
the
muffler
on
the
fourth
day
we
were
picked
up
by
a
fishing
schooner
about
fifty
miles
off
rockaway
and
towed
in
i
said
to
jakey
i
mike
corby
remember
that
and
if
you
give
your
right
name
i
kill
you
you
got
to
protect
me
i
said
i
in
bad
you
see
how
it
was
kiddo
i
was
three
days
overdue
at
camp
and
did
even
have
my
uniform
i
was
so
tired
bailing
and
standing
lookout
that
when
they
set
us
down
on
the
wharf
at
rockaway
i
could
have
slept
standing
on
my
head
and
i
gone
without
sleep
fifty
hours
at
a
stretch
on
the
west
front
in
france
would
you
believe
it
sure
i
believe
it
i
told
him
i
tell
you
the
whole
business
some
day
when
you
and
i
are
on
the
hike
i
said
cracky
you
can
bet
i
like
to
go
on
a
hike
with
you
that
what
we
will
he
said
and
we
swap
adventures
i
told
him
i
did
have
any
good
ones
like
he
had
to
swap
but
anyway
i
was
glad
he
got
home
all
right
right
he
said
you
mean
all
maybe
you
saw
the
accounts
in
the
papers
of
the
two
fishermen
who
were
picked
up
after
a
mike
corby
and
dan
mccann
that
was
us
i
left
jakey
down
at
rockaway
to
wait
for
his
engine
to
be
fixed
and
beat
it
out
to
jersey
was
i
up
in
the
air
did
even
dare
to
go
up
to
the
house
and
ask
about
it
that
rotten
little
newspaper
in
bridgeboro
had
a
big
headliner
about
me
disappearing
seen
after
leaving
camp
dix
whereabouts
a
that
what
it
said
of
professor
what
you
think
of
that
i
told
him
i
was
mighty
sorry
for
him
and
i
was
too
then
he
said
how
he
went
to
new
york
in
those
old
rags
and
tried
not
to
see
anybody
he
knew
and
even
he
hid
his
face
when
he
saw
cooper
on
the
train
and
then
he
telephoned
out
to
bridgeboro
and
little
valley
and
made
believe
he
was
somebody
else
and
said
he
heard
the
houseboat
was
for
sale
and
in
that
way
he
found
out
about
his
father
loaning
it
to
our
troop
and
how
we
were
probably
anchored
near
george
at
staten
island
oh
boy
did
he
hurry
up
to
get
there
because
he
was
afraid
we
might
be
gone
so
then
he
waited
till
night
and
he
was
just
wondering
whether
it
would
be
safe
to
wait
till
we
were
all
asleep
and
then
sneak
onto
the
boat
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
saw
the
fellows
coming
ashore
and
he
got
near
and
listened
and
he
heard
them
speak
about
going
to
the
movies
and
he
heard
one
fellow
say
something
about
how
roy
would
be
sorry
he
come
and
do
you
want
to
know
what
he
told
me
this
is
just
what
he
said
he
said
when
i
heard
your
name
was
roy
i
knew
you
be
all
right
see
because
look
at
rob
roy
he
said
was
he
a
bully
hero
and
a
good
scout
and
a
fellow
you
could
trust
with
a
secret
he
that
just
what
he
said
you
take
a
fellow
named
roy
he
said
and
you
always
find
him
true
and
loyal
he
said
there
was
a
fellow
named
roy
on
the
west
front
and
he
gave
up
his
life
before
he
tell
on
a
comrade
then
he
said
you
see
how
it
is
with
me
skeezeks
i
in
a
peck
of
trouble
and
i
got
to
get
those
army
duds
on
and
toddle
back
to
camp
as
soon
as
i
can
get
there
and
face
the
music
i
got
to
make
an
excuse
i
got
to
get
that
blamed
uniform
pressed
somehow
i
suppose
it
creased
from
the
dampness
in
that
locker
i
got
to
straighten
matters
out
if
i
can
i
just
managed
to
save
my
life
and
by
heck
be
lucky
if
i
can
just
save
my
honor
and
that
the
plain
truth
so
you
see
i
got
a
lot
to
do
he
said
and
you
got
just
the
one
thing
to
do
and
that
a
cinch
it
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
see
suppose
the
old
gent
knew
about
this
suppose
my
sister
knew
i
was
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
house
and
did
go
to
see
them
you
know
what
girls
are
i
told
him
sure
because
i
got
two
sisters
and
i
bet
they
like
you
too
i
bet
they
say
you
were
good
looking
then
he
began
to
laugh
and
he
said
well
i
bet
i
like
them
too
if
they
anything
like
you
so
now
will
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
ever
hear
of
the
scouts
oath
the
indian
scouts
oath
i
mean
loyalty
for
better
or
worser
do
say
i
was
here
do
say
you
know
anything
about
me
keep
your
mouth
shut
if
my
name
should
be
mentioned
keep
still
you
do
know
anything
nobody
was
here
see
i
said
suppose
ellsworth
or
somebody
should
ask
me
who
going
to
ask
you
he
said
you
say
nothing
and
they
say
nothing
i
fought
for
my
country
kiddo
and
i
got
two
wounds
you
do
want
to
spoil
it
all
for
me
now
do
you
i
said
i
bet
you
brave
anyhow
i
rather
face
two
german
divisions
than
what
i
got
to
face
he
said
but
if
i
know
it
all
right
at
this
end
i
worry
are
you
straight
i
would
tell
i
told
him
cracky
why
should
tell
and
i
can
see
you
got
a
lot
of
trouble
and
you
not
exactly
all
to
blame
anyway
only
i
hope
i
see
you
again
sometime
because
anyway
whatever
you
did
i
kind
of
like
you
it
one
of
our
laws
that
a
fellow
has
to
be
loyal
only
sometime
will
you
tell
me
some
of
the
things
you
did
i
mean
your
adventures
i
tell
you
all
about
the
jungles
and
the
apes
down
in
central
america
he
said
so
then
he
went
into
the
cabin
in
a
big
hurry
and
he
took
the
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
he
opened
the
locker
and
took
out
his
uniform
it
was
all
wrinkled
and
damp
but
anyway
he
looked
fine
in
it
you
can
bet
after
he
got
it
all
on
and
fixed
right
he
stuffed
his
old
clothes
into
the
place
and
locked
it
up
again
i
bet
any
girl
would
say
he
looked
fine
that
one
thing
sure
just
before
he
climbed
over
the
railing
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
took
out
some
change
and
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
dropped
some
of
it
and
it
went
all
over
the
deck
i
started
to
pick
it
up
for
him
but
he
only
said
never
mind
let
it
go
you
can
have
all
you
find
and
here
a
quarter
to
get
a
couple
of
sodas
i
said
we
do
take
anything
for
a
service
scouts
do
well
you
can
have
a
soda
on
me
ca
you
he
said
trying
to
make
me
take
the
quarter
if
you
want
me
to
be
loyal
to
you
i
have
to
be
loyal
if
i
make
a
promise
do
i
i
said
he
said
what
promise
and
i
said
i
ca
take
anything
for
a
service
then
he
hit
me
a
rap
on
the
shoulder
and
laughed
and
he
punched
me
in
the
chest
not
hard
only
kind
of
as
if
to
show
me
that
he
liked
me
then
he
said
bully
for
you
kiddo
you
one
little
trump
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
was
gone
sometimes
you
ca
tell
just
why
you
like
a
fellow
but
anyway
i
liked
him
just
the
same
chapter
iv
tells
about
the
paper
i
found
one
thing
i
bet
it
was
harris
that
the
lieutenant
heard
talking
while
he
was
hiding
on
shore
anyway
it
was
that
i
heard
first
when
they
were
on
their
way
back
that
sure
you
know
how
plain
you
can
hear
voices
on
the
water
and
believe
me
before
those
fellows
were
half
way
out
i
knew
all
about
the
bandit
of
red
hallow
that
was
the
fellow
in
the
movies
i
suppose
and
he
must
have
been
some
bandit
because
he
saved
a
school
teacher
from
about
twenty
other
bandits
and
shot
them
all
i
guess
everybody
was
shooting
pistols
at
everybody
else
like
they
mostly
do
in
the
movies
was
sticking
up
for
the
poor
school
teacher
and
it
made
me
laugh
because
he
got
much
use
for
school
teachers
on
account
of
they
always
keeping
him
in
for
talking
anyway
what
fun
is
there
in
everybody
shooting
pistols
at
each
other
me
for
stalking
that
what
say
when
ellsworth
came
on
board
he
said
well
roy
alone
in
your
glory
eh
i
did
say
anything
and
i
hoped
he
would
ask
me
any
questions
because
anyway
i
was
going
to
lie
that
one
sure
thing
i
asked
him
how
the
fellows
liked
the
movies
and
he
said
everybody
got
shot
so
they
were
all
satisfied
he
was
just
joking
he
asked
the
fellows
if
they
like
to
meet
a
lot
of
bandits
in
real
life
and
they
said
no
and
then
he
said
it
was
funny
how
they
liked
to
meet
them
in
the
movies
and
all
the
fellows
had
to
admit
it
was
crazy
you
would
catch
ellsworth
stopping
us
from
going
to
the
movies
but
he
always
makes
us
feel
silly
afterward
pretty
soon
grove
bronson
who
is
one
of
the
raving
ravens
came
up
to
me
and
gave
me
a
newspaper
with
a
whole
lot
of
ears
of
corn
in
it
and
said
we
were
going
to
have
it
for
sunday
dinner
said
they
dandy
big
ears
all
right
and
here
some
cans
of
tongue
good
night
i
told
him
i
thought
we
had
tongue
enough
with
you
here
oh
you
ought
to
have
seen
little
skinny
mccord
laugh
his
face
was
all
thin
on
account
of
his
not
being
very
strong
and
he
never
had
much
food
until
he
got
in
with
us
either
but
it
was
fun
to
see
him
laugh
whenever
we
got
back
at
there
some
heads
of
cabbage
too
he
said
doc
got
them
heads
and
ears
and
tongues
i
said
you
ought
to
have
brought
some
potatoes
so
we
have
eyes
he
thinks
i
funny
but
i
just
say
those
things
to
make
him
laugh
so
as
he
feel
good
then
i
took
all
the
stuff
into
the
galley
and
put
it
in
the
food
locker
i
was
just
crunching
up
the
newspaper
that
they
brought
the
corn
in
and
was
going
to
throw
it
out
of
the
window
when
i
saw
a
heading
that
read
have
harrowing
oh
boy
did
i
sit
down
on
the
barrel
and
read
that
article
through
first
i
looked
to
see
the
date
of
the
paper
and
i
saw
it
was
a
couple
of
days
old
after
i
read
that
article
i
cut
it
out
because
i
knew
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
all
these
things
so
here
it
is
now
for
you
to
read
fishermen
have
harrowing
adventure
the
fishing
schooner
stella
b
arrived
in
port
with
two
castaways
who
had
drifted
for
three
days
in
an
open
boat
in
the
stormy
waters
off
rockaway
the
two
men
mike
corby
and
dan
mccann
hail
from
jersey
and
were
carried
out
to
sea
in
their
foot
launch
from
about
a
mile
south
of
sea
gate
where
they
were
fishing
their
engine
broke
down
and
their
small
boat
beaten
by
the
waves
was
leaking
rapidly
when
they
were
picked
up
one
of
the
men
was
unconscious
from
lack
of
nourishment
and
the
other
in
a
state
of
utter
exhaustion
from
bailing
in
an
all
but
futile
effort
to
keep
the
frail
little
craft
above
water
after
being
resuscitated
one
of
the
men
gave
a
vague
account
of
having
encountered
a
waterlogged
containing
several
people
who
had
perished
from
exposure
and
of
certain
papers
and
possessions
found
on
one
of
them
later
when
a
reporter
made
an
effort
to
see
the
men
for
confirmation
of
this
statement
neither
could
be
found
both
are
said
to
have
carried
considerable
money
on
their
persons
but
this
was
explained
by
the
exceptionally
large
catches
of
fish
which
they
sold
during
their
fishing
trip
no
means
of
tracing
them
is
known
since
the
boat
in
which
one
of
them
resumed
his
journey
home
after
repairs
had
no
license
number
maybe
you
think
i
did
read
that
article
twice
and
it
made
me
wonder
a
lot
of
things
about
that
fishing
trip
one
thing
it
looked
as
if
they
might
have
had
more
adventures
than
lieutenant
donnelle
had
told
me
about
and
maybe
he
did
want
to
tell
me
everything
that
what
i
thought
anyway
he
did
say
anything
about
a
that
sure
but
maybe
he
forgot
to
just
the
same
i
wondered
if
maybe
he
had
any
other
reason
for
being
in
such
a
hurry
and
so
excited
kind
of
then
i
remembered
how
he
said
he
would
tell
me
all
about
it
some
day
anyway
i
said
he
had
a
lot
of
adventures
that
sure
you
bet
i
like
to
have
a
lot
of
adventures
like
that
chapter
v
tells
about
skinny
merit
badge
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
two
things
happened
not
counting
dinner
early
in
the
morning
we
drew
lots
to
see
who
be
deck
steward
for
the
day
and
skinny
was
the
one
that
meant
he
have
to
sweep
up
the
deck
and
wipe
the
rail
and
do
everything
outside
like
that
anyway
there
was
much
to
do
at
about
twelve
i
went
into
the
galley
to
cook
dinner
and
charlie
seabury
and
brick
warner
went
along
to
help
me
while
we
were
peeling
the
potatoes
skinny
came
in
and
showed
me
three
or
four
dimes
and
some
pennies
and
said
he
found
them
on
the
deck
when
he
was
sweeping
he
said
i
been
to
every
fellow
in
the
troop
and
nobody
lost
any
money
are
they
yours
i
told
him
no
and
so
did
brick
and
charlie
and
we
said
he
had
better
give
them
to
ellsworth
one
of
them
is
a
french
coin
brick
said
and
he
showed
it
to
me
and
i
saw
that
it
was
i
guess
one
of
the
fellows
dropped
some
change
climbing
over
the
rail
charlie
said
and
maybe
did
miss
it
on
account
of
not
losing
all
he
had
hey
he
know
if
he
had
a
french
coin
and
lost
it
brick
said
it
made
me
feel
kind
of
funny
because
all
the
while
i
knew
where
those
coins
came
from
anyway
skinny
went
and
gave
them
to
ellsworth
and
when
we
were
all
together
at
dinner
ellsworth
asked
us
if
any
fellow
owned
a
french
coin
that
was
missing
nobody
said
yes
and
then
he
said
kind
of
funny
like
well
i
suppose
this
is
what
our
young
friend
walter
harris
would
call
a
mystery
and
he
said
we
put
the
money
in
the
troop
treasury
then
he
gave
it
to
will
dawson
in
my
patrol
because
will
is
troop
treasurer
somebody
said
how
about
the
french
coin
that
no
use
in
the
treasury
and
ellsworth
said
we
give
that
to
skinny
because
he
found
the
money
he
said
it
would
be
a
kind
of
a
merit
badge
to
skinny
for
keeping
his
eyes
open
i
was
mighty
glad
ellsworth
did
ask
us
if
anybody
knew
anything
about
the
money
because
then
jiminy
i
do
know
what
i
would
have
done
maybe
it
would
have
been
all
right
to
keep
still
because
i
sure
whose
it
was
but
all
the
while
i
knew
i
sure
maybe
i
would
have
said
i
knew
only
i
did
want
to
tell
hey
anyway
he
did
ask
and
that
was
one
good
thing
after
dinner
skinny
came
to
me
all
smiles
and
said
i
got
a
merit
badge
it
for
keeping
my
eyes
open
and
will
you
bore
a
hole
in
it
so
i
can
wear
it
around
my
neck
oh
but
that
kid
was
happy
i
said
did
you
have
a
good
dinner
kiddo
and
he
said
yes
but
will
you
bore
a
hole
in
it
so
i
can
wear
it
around
my
neck
he
looked
awful
thin
and
his
scout
suit
did
fit
him
and
his
belt
was
tight
enough
and
he
did
look
anything
like
pictures
you
see
of
scouts
you
know
what
i
mean
and
when
he
smiled
it
made
wrinkles
in
his
cheeks
one
thing
sure
he
was
different
from
all
the
rest
of
the
fellows
even
if
it
was
only
a
little
thing
that
he
was
interested
in
he
got
all
excited
about
it
and
his
eyes
got
all
bright
and
if
he
grabbed
you
by
the
arm
you
could
feel
that
his
hand
was
trembling
he
be
so
excited
we
made
a
lot
of
allowance
for
him
because
he
was
sick
and
came
out
of
the
slums
but
anyway
one
trouble
with
him
was
that
ellsworth
could
make
him
study
up
scouting
the
way
other
fellows
do
all
of
a
sudden
he
go
crazy
for
the
gold
medal
or
the
eagle
badge
and
you
could
tell
him
that
a
fellow
has
to
get
to
be
a
first
class
scout
before
he
can
be
an
eagle
scout
he
wants
what
he
wants
when
he
wants
it
that
what
ellsworth
said
and
he
only
just
laughed
and
said
he
hammer
into
shape
all
right
let
him
enjoy
the
trip
and
it
was
just
like
him
i
mean
about
that
french
coin
he
was
always
coming
to
me
too
as
if
i
was
scoutmaster
and
everything
else
he
began
clutching
me
by
the
arm
and
saying
i
got
it
for
keeping
my
eyes
open
did
i
i
got
it
for
being
honest
and
asking
all
the
scout
guys
did
i
i
had
to
just
pull
his
hand
off
my
arm
he
was
holding
so
fast
to
it
cracky
i
did
know
what
to
tell
him
then
i
said
i
tell
you
what
you
do
alf
i
was
going
to
be
calling
him
skinny
i
said
you
go
and
ask
vic
norris
if
he
got
an
awl
or
a
small
gimlet
see
then
fix
it
for
you
vic
had
charge
of
the
locker
where
we
kept
the
lights
and
oil
and
tools
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff
pretty
soon
he
came
back
with
an
awning
needle
and
asked
me
if
it
would
do
i
think
he
would
have
gone
crazy
if
i
had
told
him
no
i
said
yes
i
guess
so
come
ahead
and
let
go
my
arm
do
you
hear
i
not
going
to
run
away
then
he
said
i
like
you
better
than
any
of
the
scout
guys
we
not
guys
we
just
scouts
i
told
him
you
can
cut
out
the
guys
did
ellsworth
tell
you
that
the
fellows
were
sitting
around
on
the
deck
reading
some
of
them
were
sprawling
around
on
the
cabin
roof
killing
time
and
jollying
i
do
know
where
ellsworth
was
but
i
guess
he
was
inside
writing
letters
anyway
it
was
nice
and
sunny
and
you
could
see
the
sun
in
the
water
over
on
shore
in
george
i
could
hear
a
church
bell
and
it
sounded
clear
there
were
many
boats
out
except
sometimes
the
boats
to
coney
island
went
by
and
we
could
hear
the
music
i
thought
rather
be
where
i
was
anyway
maybe
it
was
because
it
was
sunday
and
because
it
was
so
still
all
around
that
i
had
a
good
idea
anyway
i
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
but
it
got
me
into
a
kind
of
a
scrape
that
one
thing
about
me
i
always
getting
in
scrapes
so
then
i
took
skinny
and
we
climbed
in
through
the
galley
window
i
guess
nobody
noticed
us
nobody
said
anything
except
el
sawyer
he
asked
me
if
i
was
going
to
get
supper
supper
i
said
did
you
just
have
dinner
honest
that
fellow
never
thinks
of
anything
except
eats
when
we
got
into
the
galley
i
said
to
skinny
let
sit
up
on
the
board
so
we
can
look
out
and
see
the
bay
so
we
sat
on
the
board
that
was
on
two
barrels
i
used
it
to
open
cans
on
and
slice
bread
and
all
that
and
i
always
washed
it
good
and
clean
you
can
bet
oh
but
it
was
nice
sitting
there
and
it
was
just
as
quiet
as
it
is
in
the
woods
sometimes
a
motor
boat
would
go
by
and
we
could
hear
it
chugging
one
thing
nobody
bother
us
here
i
said
some
fellows
do
like
sunday
but
i
do
skinny
said
i
like
christmas
best
because
rich
people
bring
baskets
of
food
cracky
i
felt
awful
sorry
for
him
chapter
vi
tells
how
skinny
and
i
got
together
first
i
bored
a
hole
in
the
coin
and
hung
it
around
skinny
neck
he
was
all
excited
and
said
now
i
got
a
regular
merit
badge
i
i
said
no
you
have
but
it
a
good
badge
all
right
then
i
said
now
i
going
to
tell
you
some
things
about
merit
badges
you
get
merit
badge
because
you
able
to
do
special
things
see
you
get
them
for
being
able
to
do
things
that
some
other
fellows
ca
do
kind
of
not
exactly
that
i
told
him
because
most
fellows
can
do
the
things
if
they
try
hard
enough
but
anyway
there
is
any
merit
badge
for
keeping
your
eyes
open
ellsworth
was
only
joking
about
that
and
especially
you
do
get
any
merit
badge
for
being
honest
because
that
would
be
too
easy
if
you
could
get
one
for
that
all
the
fellows
would
have
them
that
sure
he
said
ai
it
good
to
be
honest
i
told
him
sure
it
was
but
it
was
too
easy
and
that
all
the
scouts
were
honest
anyway
even
without
badges
then
i
said
if
you
wore
that
on
account
of
being
honest
that
would
insult
all
the
other
fellows
would
it
he
just
stared
at
me
but
did
say
anything
so
you
have
to
be
careful
i
told
him
not
to
be
saying
that
you
have
a
reward
for
being
honest
see
then
i
told
him
about
there
not
being
any
badge
for
keeping
his
eyes
open
and
finding
things
but
there
a
badge
for
something
else
like
that
i
said
only
you
ca
get
it
yet
because
you
have
to
learn
a
lot
of
things
first
and
it
a
lot
of
fun
learning
them
too
he
said
can
i
learn
them
right
now
i
said
no
but
you
learn
a
lot
of
them
up
in
camp
then
i
told
them
that
the
one
that
had
most
to
do
with
keeping
his
eyes
open
was
the
stalking
badge
so
then
i
got
out
the
handbook
and
showed
him
the
picture
of
it
and
read
him
what
it
said
gee
williger
i
do
see
where
there
was
any
harm
in
that
do
you
i
read
him
the
three
conditions
and
the
four
so
you
see
that
means
keeping
your
eyes
open
all
right
i
told
him
because
you
have
to
be
all
the
time
watching
for
signs
and
tracks
in
the
snow
or
in
the
dirt
so
as
you
can
tell
where
a
bird
went
maybe
and
sneak
up
and
watch
him
that
one
thing
i
can
do
he
said
sneak
i
a
little
sneak
everybody
said
so
good
night
that
kid
was
the
limit
i
do
mean
that
way
i
told
him
but
you
have
to
that
means
to
follow
a
bird
or
an
animal
and
watch
them
without
them
knowing
anything
about
it
see
he
said
all
excited
like
i
can
sneak
up
on
so
then
can
i
have
the
badge
for
sneaking
like
you
said
gee
whiz
i
just
sat
back
and
laughed
then
i
said
not
sneaking
but
that
the
badge
you
after
so
the
one
you
want
to
think
about
do
think
about
a
whole
lot
of
things
but
just
think
about
that
he
said
i
like
you
a
whole
lot
and
that
the
one
i
going
to
get
because
you
say
so
just
then
i
noticed
stut
moran
we
call
him
that
because
he
stutters
going
past
the
window
pretty
soon
i
noticed
him
passing
again
and
walking
very
slow
you
just
keep
your
mind
on
that
one
badge
and
remember
those
letters
i
said
and
for
goodness
sake
do
talk
about
badges
for
sneaking
because
you
take
a
tip
from
me
you
can
only
do
one
thing
at
a
time
he
said
the
poultry
badge
is
a
good
one
it
got
a
picture
of
a
rooster
on
it
you
should
worry
about
pictures
of
roosters
i
said
just
keep
thinking
about
that
one
badge
you
take
my
advice
because
you
good
on
keeping
your
eyes
open
and
that
the
badge
for
you
and
small
and
kind
of
thin
and
that
good
in
stalking
too
because
you
can
hide
behind
trees
and
things
then
i
said
if
you
make
me
a
promise
that
you
just
think
about
that
one
badge
and
not
about
a
lot
of
others
all
at
once
when
we
get
up
to
camp
i
make
you
a
basket
out
of
a
to
hang
around
your
neck
just
then
the
door
of
the
galley
opened
and
in
came
connie
bennett
right
behind
him
were
vic
norris
and
stut
moran
connie
is
leader
of
the
elks
and
the
other
two
fellows
are
elks
too
right
away
he
began
and
i
saw
he
was
mad
that
a
good
thing
you
talking
about
he
said
i
said
what
do
you
mean
he
getting
a
good
lesson
in
sneaking
all
right
he
shot
right
back
at
me
gee
whiz
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
i
said
oh
no
he
said
all
the
while
sort
of
sneering
at
me
i
suppose
you
did
bring
him
in
here
so
you
could
be
where
nobody
else
heard
you
maybe
you
think
you
own
the
galley
sure
i
brought
him
in
here
so
we
could
be
alone
i
said
you
he
said
just
so
you
could
start
him
after
the
stalker
badge
we
heard
you
make
him
promise
to
go
after
that
and
not
think
about
anything
else
he
easy
that
kid
is
why
should
i
i
began
you
know
well
enough
why
he
said
who
started
the
rule
about
not
having
two
of
the
same
merit
badges
in
a
patrol
i
did
i
told
him
yes
he
said
and
now
you
trying
to
rush
this
kid
through
just
so
you
can
get
even
with
vic
what
have
got
to
do
with
our
patrol
anyway
do
you
think
we
old
enough
to
take
care
of
our
new
members
all
because
you
and
vic
were
on
the
outs
last
summer
jingo
that
made
me
mad
i
forgot
all
about
that
i
said
did
vic
treat
me
to
a
soda
only
last
week
it
was
a
quarrel
anyway
i
should
worry
about
who
has
the
stalker
badge
in
your
patrol
i
did
even
know
vic
was
after
it
you
know
yourself
the
kid
has
begun
his
tests
yet
what
chance
does
stand
if
vic
is
after
it
i
only
thought
i
try
to
do
a
good
turn
cracky
it
hard
enough
to
think
up
anything
to
do
out
here
on
a
sunday
afternoon
you
know
that
yourself
i
was
waiting
all
day
for
somebody
to
fall
overboard
so
i
could
jump
in
and
save
them
you
a
lot
of
old
grandmothers
in
your
patrol
if
that
all
you
got
to
complain
about
you
better
go
and
sweep
the
wind
off
the
deck
you
mean
to
tell
me
to
go
and
sweep
the
wind
off
the
deck
connie
said
coming
right
up
close
to
me
sure
i
said
and
when
you
get
through
with
that
go
and
clean
the
reflection
out
of
the
water
i
should
worry
here
take
your
new
member
if
i
known
vic
was
after
the
badge
i
would
have
said
a
word
about
it
you
can
bet
you
ought
to
know
me
well
enough
to
know
i
was
just
giving
him
a
few
tips
did
i
have
any
quarrel
with
you
vic
honest
would
you
believe
it
none
of
them
said
a
word
except
come
ahead
skinny
and
the
poor
kid
followed
them
out
not
knowing
what
to
think
i
guess
end
of
a
perfect
day
i
said
chapter
vii
tells
about
my
merit
badge
was
that
a
crazy
thing
just
because
last
summer
i
put
a
stalking
sign
on
one
of
vic
trees
how
did
i
know
it
was
his
as
soon
as
he
told
me
i
marked
off
my
claim
the
same
as
any
scout
would
maybe
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
he
was
out
for
the
stalker
badge
but
believe
me
i
have
enough
to
remember
with
the
silver
fox
patrol
gee
whiz
nobody
can
say
that
i
ever
butt
in
when
a
patrol
is
breaking
in
a
tenderfoot
that
one
thing
i
would
do
i
would
even
have
bothered
to
tell
you
about
it
at
all
except
that
it
had
that
what
said
at
supper
there
was
a
big
round
flat
piece
of
wood
tied
with
a
rope
at
my
place
and
on
it
was
printed
it
must
have
been
cut
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
from
a
grocery
box
because
i
noticed
on
the
other
side
of
it
it
said
i
suppose
it
meant
some
kind
of
cookies
or
crackers
or
soap
maybe
so
just
for
the
fun
of
it
i
stood
up
and
said
friends
and
enemies
ever
since
about
five
this
afternoon
been
hunting
for
a
chance
to
do
a
good
turn
the
first
one
i
tried
to
do
did
pan
out
so
here
my
chance
to
do
a
good
turn
and
i
have
to
thank
the
honorable
elk
patrol
for
giving
me
the
chance
then
i
turned
the
big
wooden
medal
over
so
the
other
side
showed
and
everybody
read
and
began
to
laugh
even
vie
norris
had
to
laugh
if
it
was
for
the
elks
i
have
to
go
to
bed
without
doing
a
good
turn
crinkums
you
ought
to
have
seen
ellsworth
laugh
all
the
time
he
knew
something
was
wrong
i
guess
but
he
never
bothered
with
things
like
that
settle
your
own
disputes
that
what
he
always
said
the
only
fellow
that
did
take
it
as
a
joke
was
connie
bennett
and
just
for
that
reason
you
have
to
hear
more
about
it
one
thing
more
happened
that
day
when
it
was
nearly
dark
westy
martin
he
my
special
chum
came
to
me
and
said
there
a
boat
coming
this
way
and
i
think
it
coming
here
i
went
over
to
the
rail
where
all
of
the
fellows
were
watching
and
there
was
a
rowboat
with
two
men
in
it
headed
straight
for
us
pretty
soon
they
came
alongside
and
oh
boy
i
was
so
shaky
that
i
just
held
onto
the
rail
with
my
hand
trembling
because
they
had
badges
on
and
i
knew
they
were
men
belonging
to
the
government
good
night
i
said
to
myself
it
all
up
now
they
after
lieutenant
donnelle
they
going
to
search
the
and
ask
a
lot
of
questions
and
i
have
to
tell
when
they
got
on
board
one
of
them
said
we
just
want
to
give
you
the
once
over
mate
oh
did
my
heart
go
down
to
my
feet
i
thought
it
would
be
all
right
if
i
did
stay
around
because
they
could
ask
me
any
questions
if
i
was
there
and
i
was
on
the
side
of
lieutenant
donnelle
i
care
what
so
i
went
into
the
galley
and
began
straightening
things
out
there
after
a
little
while
westy
came
and
stuck
his
head
in
through
the
window
are
they
gone
i
asked
him
sure
he
said
then
i
said
what
did
they
want
they
were
only
just
inspectors
he
said
and
they
wanted
to
know
if
we
had
power
you
mean
an
engine
i
asked
him
sure
he
said
because
if
a
boat
has
a
it
has
to
have
a
license
and
a
certain
kind
of
whistle
and
bell
and
lights
and
all
that
a
fixed
engine
i
said
if
we
had
one
it
probably
would
be
fixed
they
meant
a
stationary
engine
he
said
you
crazy
indian
what
else
did
they
say
i
asked
because
i
was
still
kind
of
nervous
they
told
us
we
should
have
a
life
preserver
for
everybody
on
board
and
a
fog
horn
cracky
was
i
relieved
is
fog
horn
enough
i
said
just
the
same
it
started
me
thinking
about
lieutenant
donnelle
again
and
after
i
went
to
bed
i
kept
on
thinking
about
him
so
i
could
get
to
sleep
one
thing
i
knew
i
liked
him
a
lot
that
was
sure
but
now
since
i
knew
about
the
new
law
that
a
motor
boat
has
to
have
a
license
i
wondered
why
jake
holden
did
have
one
and
have
the
number
on
his
boat
like
everybody
has
to
anyway
it
was
lucky
for
him
that
he
did
have
any
number
on
because
now
they
have
a
hard
job
finding
him
especially
because
i
knew
he
did
give
his
right
name
and
then
i
began
wondering
about
the
adventure
that
jake
and
lieutenant
donnelle
had
one
thing
sure
it
must
be
pretty
bad
to
be
out
on
the
ocean
like
that
in
a
little
boat
and
be
almost
dead
i
was
wondering
if
there
was
any
more
to
it
than
lieutenant
donnelle
told
me
maybe
anyway
he
had
lots
of
adventures
in
his
life
that
was
sure
i
was
glad
he
said
we
go
on
a
hike
some
day
after
a
while
when
i
could
get
to
sleep
i
got
up
and
went
out
on
the
deck
and
sat
in
one
of
the
big
steamer
chairs
oh
it
was
fine
it
was
all
pitch
dark
and
all
you
could
see
were
the
lights
on
the
boats
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
a
sound
and
saw
a
face
and
the
hair
round
the
face
was
all
hanging
down
and
it
gave
me
a
scare
kind
of
then
i
saw
it
was
skinny
he
said
can
i
sit
down
alongside
of
you
i
said
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
and
he
said
i
ca
go
to
sleep
because
i
keep
thinking
and
i
want
to
stay
right
near
you
i
ai
mad
at
you
anyway
were
you
thinking
about
how
they
got
mad
at
you
all
the
while
he
came
closer
and
he
took
hold
of
my
arm
with
his
hand
and
his
hand
was
hot
even
through
my
khaki
shirt
i
could
feel
it
and
his
eyes
did
look
like
the
other
fellows
eyes
i
said
i
could
sleep
because
i
was
thinking
about
a
fellow
a
hero
he
a
big
fellow
you
know
what
a
hero
is
i
said
are
you
a
hero
that
what
he
said
that
just
what
he
said
anyway
one
thing
i
did
know
then
and
that
was
that
skinny
was
going
to
have
more
to
do
with
lieutenant
donnelle
than
i
was
poor
little
kid
he
did
know
it
either
that
was
one
good
thing
chapter
viii
tells
about
our
trip
up
the
hudson
he
said
if
they
get
mad
when
i
talk
to
you
i
talk
to
you
on
the
sly
it
all
right
to
like
a
fellow
that
is
in
your
patrol
it
sure
it
is
i
told
him
you
have
to
like
everybody
but
you
do
what
they
tell
you
and
then
nobody
get
mad
he
said
the
swimming
badge
is
a
good
one
is
it
it
a
dandy
one
i
said
then
he
told
me
that
was
the
one
they
wanted
him
to
try
for
he
said
can
i
try
for
it
now
i
thought
i
better
watch
my
step
safety
first
hey
so
i
said
you
ask
connie
i
should
think
there
be
any
objection
to
trying
now
then
after
you
passed
your
first
class
tests
you
could
just
scoop
the
badge
right
up
see
i
looked
at
all
the
pictures
of
the
badges
he
said
and
i
like
the
one
with
the
picture
of
a
rooster
best
is
the
swimming
one
better
than
that
i
said
yes
because
every
scout
has
got
to
know
how
to
swim
anyway
connie
knows
best
and
he
your
patrol
leader
so
you
do
whatever
he
tells
you
to
will
i
be
able
to
beat
everybody
swimming
he
said
i
told
him
maybe
if
he
tried
hard
and
then
i
told
him
he
better
go
to
bed
he
said
he
would
be
able
to
sleep
now
on
account
of
thinking
about
the
swimming
badge
anyway
he
went
and
i
noticed
how
skinny
his
legs
were
it
made
me
feel
awful
sorry
for
him
because
his
suit
did
fit
him
and
looked
kind
of
funny
his
eyes
were
funny
anyway
and
gave
me
the
fidgets
but
in
the
dark
you
could
just
see
them
shine
i
told
him
to
go
inside
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
think
about
the
swimming
badge
one
thing
about
skinny
i
knew
he
never
make
a
good
scout
like
some
fellows
you
know
what
i
mean
now
you
take
artie
van
arlen
he
got
eleven
merit
badges
and
he
got
the
bronze
medal
maybe
say
photography
was
his
bug
but
he
never
went
crazy
about
it
one
sure
thing
take
i
got
nine
merit
badges
the
more
the
merrier
i
do
care
but
skinny
could
only
think
about
one
thing
and
he
go
clean
crazy
about
it
ellsworth
says
he
hanged
if
i
know
what
that
is
all
i
know
is
that
he
could
think
about
a
lot
of
things
he
just
could
read
the
handbook
through
all
of
a
sudden
when
he
be
reading
it
he
see
something
that
he
liked
and
good
night
forget
everything
else
ellsworth
said
skinny
would
never
do
anything
except
thing
and
most
likely
that
would
be
a
big
stunt
and
if
he
failed
it
would
kill
him
i
guess
he
was
a
kind
of
a
genius
like
you
know
what
i
mean
either
that
or
he
was
half
crazy
i
could
never
make
him
out
i
know
that
one
thing
i
was
mighty
glad
he
was
going
in
for
the
swimming
badge
and
i
hoped
the
elks
would
help
him
he
sure
have
the
best
swimmer
in
the
troop
to
help
him
and
that
was
hunt
ward
he
can
swim
better
than
any
raven
or
silver
fox
either
i
have
to
admit
that
especially
good
to
go
in
for
the
swimming
badge
right
away
as
soon
as
you
join
a
troop
even
though
you
ca
get
your
award
till
you
pass
your
first
class
tests
because
gee
every
fellow
ought
to
know
how
to
swim
that
one
sure
thing
the
next
morning
good
and
early
we
could
see
the
that
captain
savage
tug
heading
across
the
bay
straight
for
us
and
as
soon
as
it
got
close
enough
we
gave
captain
savage
a
good
cheer
captain
savage
was
standing
up
in
the
little
house
smoking
his
pipe
and
he
shouted
to
us
and
said
he
was
delayed
on
account
of
getting
his
propeller
wet
that
was
just
like
him
he
was
always
joking
then
he
shouted
to
us
it
a
wonder
you
would
get
into
shallow
water
do
you
know
how
many
feet
you
got
shouted
back
two
what
do
you
think
we
are
quadrupeds
laugh
honest
that
kid
is
a
scream
i
guess
we
must
have
been
in
pretty
shallow
water
because
captain
savage
made
us
all
hustle
throwing
ropes
and
winding
them
around
you
know
what
i
mean
and
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
did
come
on
the
at
all
but
he
said
we
had
a
mighty
neat
comfortable
craft
and
that
it
looked
as
if
it
might
have
slid
off
some
street
or
other
into
the
water
he
was
awful
funny
pretty
soon
we
were
sailing
up
the
hudson
alongside
of
the
the
day
before
i
thought
that
when
the
tug
came
it
would
tow
us
behind
with
a
long
rope
and
it
seemed
funny
like
to
be
tied
fast
alongside
the
tug
it
seemed
kind
of
as
if
the
was
being
arrested
you
know
how
i
mean
anyway
i
liked
that
way
best
because
we
could
be
always
climbing
back
and
forth
and
believe
me
most
of
us
were
on
the
tug
all
the
time
i
guess
maybe
captain
savage
liked
anyway
he
called
for
and
me
to
go
up
in
the
pilot
house
and
it
was
fine
to
watch
him
steer
and
pull
the
rope
that
made
the
whistle
blow
jiminety
did
we
jump
the
first
time
we
heard
it
captain
savage
said
yer
see
it
do
cost
me
nuthin
fur
a
as
you
might
say
now
if
this
here
old
craft
was
an
automobile
how
much
would
i
have
to
pay
for
tires
with
a
every
minute
huh
then
he
look
awful
funny
like
at
you
can
bet
captain
savage
was
nice
to
us
fellows
and
we
all
liked
him
he
had
to
stop
at
peekskill
and
he
took
us
all
ashore
for
a
peek
that
what
he
said
and
he
treated
us
all
to
sodas
you
get
dandy
raspberry
sodas
in
peekskill
after
that
we
started
for
poughkeepsie
and
that
was
as
far
as
he
was
going
to
tow
us
because
he
had
to
tow
a
barge
down
to
new
york
but
any
way
we
should
worry
there
is
any
tide
above
poughkeepsie
and
any
dinky
little
kicker
could
tow
us
up
to
catskill
landing
from
there
believe
me
i
said
if
there
are
any
ways
around
here
we
find
them
finding
ways
to
do
things
is
our
middle
name
we
had
captain
savage
on
the
to
lunch
with
us
and
ellsworth
made
a
speech
and
said
we
were
all
much
obliged
to
him
and
oh
boy
when
that
tug
started
down
the
river
again
did
we
stand
on
the
cabin
roof
of
the
and
cheer
captain
savage
he
had
about
six
before
he
got
very
far
just
answering
our
cheers
oh
cracky
but
he
was
one
fine
man
chapter
ix
tells
about
skinny
swimming
lesson
i
do
know
what
to
call
this
chapter
maybe
it
will
come
without
calling
hey
anyway
i
should
worry
maybe
i
think
of
a
name
when
i
finished
with
it
it
will
be
mostly
about
skinny
there
is
much
more
to
tell
about
our
trip
to
catskill
landing
but
you
just
wait
and
there
be
a
lot
to
tell
you
about
our
cruise
down
again
do
be
in
a
hurry
just
you
wait
more
haste
less
speed
but
take
it
from
me
you
do
get
much
speed
out
of
a
a
belongs
to
the
family
that
what
ellsworth
says
that
night
we
kept
the
boat
tied
up
to
the
dock
in
poughkeepsie
and
took
a
hike
around
the
town
while
ellsworth
tried
to
find
somebody
who
would
tow
us
up
to
catskill
landing
when
we
got
back
he
said
he
had
been
talking
with
a
man
who
had
a
little
steam
yacht
and
would
tow
us
as
far
as
catskill
landing
he
said
it
would
cost
anything
because
anyway
he
was
going
up
through
lake
champlain
and
lake
george
and
he
was
strong
for
the
boy
scouts
you
hear
lots
of
men
say
that
but
one
thing
he
was
going
for
two
days
and
so
we
have
to
stay
tied
up
in
poughkeepsie
waiting
for
him
you
see
we
were
a
kind
of
a
tramp
boat
but
what
did
we
care
as
long
as
we
got
to
camp
some
time
or
other
scouts
are
tramps
anyway
hey
so
now
i
have
to
tell
you
about
that
two
days
we
spent
in
poughkeepsie
and
most
of
the
time
we
spent
in
teaching
skinny
to
swim
of
course
that
was
up
to
the
elks
and
you
can
bet
i
did
interfere
nor
any
of
my
patrol
either
but
i
was
mighty
glad
to
see
how
easy
it
was
for
him
to
learn
illustration
most
of
the
time
was
spent
in
teaching
skinny
to
swim
that
kid
is
half
fish
doc
carson
said
to
me
no
wonder
i
said
most
all
his
life
has
been
spent
in
the
marshes
he
going
to
be
a
you
see
he
walk
away
with
that
badge
when
he
once
gets
started
westy
said
you
mean
he
swim
away
with
it
i
said
look
how
that
little
codger
can
dive
one
thing
there
was
a
dandy
place
for
learning
that
sure
we
put
the
skiff
into
the
water
and
a
couple
of
the
elks
rowed
around
near
the
keeping
near
while
hunt
ward
showed
skinny
the
strokes
the
rest
of
us
sat
along
the
cabin
roof
cheering
just
the
kid
would
be
encouraged
he
looked
awfully
thin
and
little
in
his
bathing
suit
and
whenever
he
climbed
up
to
the
deck
of
the
the
wet
cloth
stuck
tight
to
him
and
made
him
look
oh
i
do
know
kind
of
like
a
marsh
rat
as
you
may
say
that
what
he
always
said
people
called
him
a
and
i
guess
he
was
even
kind
of
proud
of
it
one
sure
thing
he
was
game
and
he
was
just
the
same
in
learning
to
swim
as
he
was
in
everything
else
he
got
all
excited
and
wanted
to
go
too
fast
as
soon
as
he
got
the
hang
of
it
and
could
manage
a
few
strokes
he
wanted
to
swim
across
the
river
he
started
right
off
before
the
fellows
in
the
boat
noticed
him
and
was
heading
across
stream
two
or
three
times
we
heard
him
sputtering
and
shouting
can
i
have
that
badge
late
that
afternoon
they
let
him
dive
off
the
deck
it
was
low
and
it
did
make
much
of
a
dive
of
course
he
did
dive
right
he
only
just
jumped
and
went
kerflop
into
the
water
and
he
had
us
all
laughing
as
soon
as
he
found
out
how
much
fun
it
was
he
kept
climbing
up
and
splashing
into
the
water
again
oh
boy
it
was
as
good
as
a
circus
to
see
him
then
he
go
swimming
to
the
skiff
and
climb
in
just
like
a
little
eel
and
sit
there
shivering
you
can
bet
that
kid
is
going
to
have
the
swimming
badge
all
right
we
all
said
the
trouble
is
going
to
be
to
hold
him
back
and
we
were
right
too
because
when
he
came
up
on
the
cabin
roof
to
get
dry
all
of
a
sudden
before
any
of
us
knew
it
he
was
over
at
the
edge
and
dived
off
before
ellsworth
had
a
chance
to
call
to
him
that
was
sure
too
much
of
a
dive
for
a
beginner
for
if
he
hit
the
water
face
down
and
flat
that
might
have
been
the
end
of
him
the
skiff
was
hauled
up
then
so
hunt
ward
dived
in
after
him
but
he
had
to
swim
some
to
catch
him
and
it
was
mighty
funny
to
see
them
that
night
ellsworth
gave
skinny
a
good
lecture
and
told
him
he
must
do
things
like
that
until
he
was
told
to
but
i
guess
skinny
did
understand
when
i
saw
mr
ellsworth
sitting
alone
on
the
deck
after
dark
i
went
up
and
sat
down
and
began
talking
to
him
i
often
do
that
i
said
i
guess
skinny
going
to
get
the
swimming
badge
all
right
yes
i
guess
he
is
that
what
ellsworth
said
skinny
too
much
for
me
if
the
boys
would
only
teach
him
a
little
scouting
i
be
better
pleased
he
wants
to
be
a
swimmer
now
he
not
thinking
about
being
a
scout
he
thinks
of
the
badge
only
as
something
to
wear
i
tried
to
teach
him
some
things
out
of
the
handbook
i
said
but
the
elks
did
like
it
i
tried
to
tell
him
some
things
about
scouting
and
all
i
got
was
a
good
lecture
from
connie
nix
on
teaching
fellows
in
other
patrols
ellsworth
seemed
awfully
worried
kind
of
he
just
sat
thinking
a
minute
then
he
said
i
afraid
skinny
is
going
to
be
hard
to
tame
he
make
a
fine
swimmer
and
a
fine
stalker
i
said
he
calls
that
sneaking
ellsworth
laughed
and
said
but
the
principal
thing
is
to
make
him
a
good
scout
has
he
done
any
good
turns
i
said
the
only
good
turns
i
know
about
are
the
good
turns
he
made
in
diving
he
turns
every
which
way
well
i
hope
he
can
forget
about
swimming
long
enough
to
eat
his
supper
ellsworth
said
but
just
the
same
skinny
did
chapter
x
tells
about
skinny
and
the
elks
well
that
was
the
way
it
was
with
skinny
and
i
could
see
that
the
elks
were
rushing
him
through
so
that
he
get
the
badge
that
used
to
be
one
trouble
with
the
elks
and
i
do
care
if
they
do
know
i
said
it
they
got
one
good
lesson
to
cure
them
that
sure
the
trouble
with
them
was
they
were
making
a
collection
of
badges
and
when
you
out
for
badges
you
skip
at
lot
of
pages
in
the
handbook
that
sure
the
next
day
i
said
to
connie
bennett
this
is
just
what
i
said
i
said
i
hope
you
wo
get
mad
at
me
again
if
i
say
something
about
skinny
because
anyway
it
none
of
business
that
sure
but
as
long
as
you
fellows
are
busy
teaching
him
stunts
and
things
i
see
that
there
would
be
any
harm
in
it
if
i
read
some
things
in
the
handbook
to
him
some
other
kind
of
things
i
mean
he
said
what
kind
of
things
oh
just
about
the
laws
and
things
like
that
like
about
being
honest
and
obedient
you
know
you
keep
your
hands
off
my
patrol
that
just
what
he
said
and
you
need
start
hinting
that
the
elks
are
dishonest
who
hinting
that
i
said
kind
of
mad
you
remind
me
of
an
airplane
you
always
going
up
in
the
air
if
any
of
my
patrol
are
dishonest
they
be
thrown
out
he
said
and
maybe
they
be
welcome
in
the
silver
foxes
sure
i
said
we
make
a
specialty
of
burglars
and
pickpockets
we
eat
alive
all
i
was
asking
you
was
that
you
let
me
teach
skinny
some
of
the
stuff
you
know
what
i
mean
you
jealous
because
he
a
genius
connie
said
and
you
want
to
fill
him
up
with
grandmother
stuff
why
do
you
let
the
kid
alone
we
take
care
of
him
all
right
i
said
i
should
worry
only
there
no
use
getting
mad
we
all
one
troop
yes
but
we
three
separate
patrols
he
said
united
we
stand
divided
we
sprawl
i
said
then
he
walked
away
that
was
the
second
day
at
poughkeepsie
and
most
all
day
the
elks
were
busy
turning
skinny
into
a
fish
some
of
the
rest
of
us
went
up
to
metzger
candy
store
to
get
some
did
you
ever
eat
those
was
quiet
for
an
hour
munching
one
the
licorice
ones
are
best
in
the
afternoon
we
sat
along
the
cabin
roof
watching
skinny
and
the
elks
good
night
you
should
have
seen
that
kid
every
time
the
fellows
in
the
boat
had
to
row
after
him
because
he
go
swimming
away
on
his
own
hook
he
never
paid
any
attention
to
what
they
told
him
throw
him
a
grove
bronson
said
just
for
fun
nix
i
said
you
do
catch
me
interfering
with
the

was
enough
when
i
try
any
polishing
i
polish
up
the
silver
foxes
go
ahead
throw
him
one
grove
said
to
but
i
guess
did
have
any
jawbreakers
to
spare
his
cheeks
were
sticking
out
and
there
was
licorice
all
over
his
lips
and
he
said
this
is
the
way
it
sounded
i
ooo

something
like
that
honest

then
all
of
a
sudden
wig
weigand
shouted
look
at
that
will
you
look
we
could
just
see
hunt
ward
reach
out
of
the
skiff
for
skinny
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
disappeared
and
came
up
about
twenty
feet
from
the
skiff
everybody
began
laughing
and
i
guess
the
elks
were
mad
because
they
thought
we
were
just
sitting
up
there
kidding
them
right
then
i
heard
ellsworth
calling
out
from
just
in
back
of
us
take
him
in
the
skiff
and
bring
him
aboard
huntley
now
e
ng
t
gt
cld
down
said
munching
away
on
a
jaw
breaker
you
look
as
if
you
been
gargling
a
bottle
of
ink
i
told
him
do
talk
you
ca
do
two
things
at
once
pretty
soon
skinny
came
up
the
ladder
to
the
cabin
roof
where
we
were
all
sitting
his
wet
bathing
suit
stuck
to
him
and
it
made
him
look
terribly
thin
and
his
hair
was
all
streaked
and
the
water
was
dripping
from
his
face
but
anyway
his
eyes
were
bright
and
all
excited
i
never
saw
another
fellow
that
had
eyes
like
that
he
had
the
piece
of
candy
in
his
hand
and
it
was
all
melting
from
the
water
and
his
hand
was
black
and
sticky
jiminy
he
looked
awful
small
and
skinny
alongside
of
ellsworth
and
i
had
to
feel
sorry
for
him
as
soon
as
ellsworth
began
to
speak
skinny
looked
up
at
him
and
said
i
got
it
i
dived
and
got
it
see
i
saved
it
i
did
eat
it
i
can
swim
under
the
water
now
can
i
have
the
badge
cracky
the
way
he
stared
if
i
had
the
badge
i
have
torn
it
off
my
arm
and
handed
it
to
him
honest
i
would
ellsworth
just
looked
at
him
and
said
no
you
may
not
have
the
badge
before
you
can
have
the
badge
for
swimming
you
must
be
a
better
scout
you
must
learn
to
be
obedient
you
heard
one
of
your
patrol
tell
you
not
to
go
under
water
you
heard
your
patrol
leader
tell
you
to
get
into
the
skiff
do
you
think
you
know
better
than
they
do
what
is
best
for
you
even
still
he
did
pay
any
attention
he
was
so
excited
now
am
i
a
hero
he
said
no
you
are
not
a
hero
ellsworth
told
him
and
you
will
go
inside
and
get
your
uniform
on
the
first
duty
of
a
scout
is
to
obey
his
leader
and
you
have
failed
to
do
that
you
are
very
much
mistaken
as
to
the
meaning
of
heroism
and
it
was
necessary
to
bring
us
any
proof
that
you
got
the
candy
or
whatever
that
is
scouts
are
not
in
the
habit
of
lying
and
deceiving
we
expect
always
to
believe
you
without
proof
throw
that
away
and
go
inside
and
get
your
clothes
on
gee
maybe
he
was
right
but
anyway
i
felt
mighty
sorry
for
skinny
his
eyes
were
all
full
of
tears
and
he
went
over
to
the
rail
and
threw
the
sticky
out
into
the
water
i
i
could
see
by
his
neck
that
he
was
gulping
and
trying
not
to
cry
and
oh
boy
it
made
me
feel
bad
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
always
that
way
with
him
that
he
had
to
be
disappointed
and
that
things
never
came
out
right
with
him
anyway
i
said
to
myself
it
connie
fault
and
all
the
rest
of
the
elks
are
to
blame
too
why
did
they
tell
him
in
the
beginning
about
those
other
things
all
they
cared
about
was
showing
their
new
member
off
to
the
rest
of
the
troop
and
you
see
how
it
ended
first
i
thought
i
go
in
and
talk
to
skinny
and
tell
him
he
was
a
wonder
for
that
was
just
what
he
was
and
ellsworth
knew
it
too
then
i
decided
that
i
better
not
on
account
of
connie
and
anyway
i
would
have
any
right
to
go
in
and
spoil
what
our
scoutmaster
said
would
i
chapter
xi
tells
you
how
to
get
to
temple
camp
gee
whiz
i
would
say
anything
against
the
elks
that
sure
because
they
all
peachy
scouts
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
but
i
have
to
admit
that
they
crazy
about
stunts
they
have
more
merit
badges
in
their
patrol
than
there
are
in
the
ravens
and
silver
foxes
put
together
hunt
ward
sleeve
looks
like
one
of
those
indian
totem
poles
there
are
so
many
badges
on
it
anyway
i
should
worry
we
have
badges
in
our
patrol
and
more
good
turns
in
the
troop
book
than
either
of
the
other
patrols
that
what
counts
too
good
turns
the
trouble
with
the
elks
was
that
every
time
they
got
a
new
fellow
he
must
take
a
header
for
some
badge
or
other
and
most
always
he
would
have
two
or
three
stunt
badges
that
merit
badges
you
know
waiting
for
him
when
he
passed
his
first
class
tests
begin
at
the
beginning
that
what
ellsworth
always
said
and
he
says
it
more
important
to
know
the
scout
oath
and
follow
it
than
it
is
to
get
the
eagle
award
connie
a
good
patrol
leader
all
right
gee
nobody
can
say
he
is
but
he
crazy
about
stunts
and
merit
badges
he
always
seemed
to
think
that
that
was
all
there
was
to
scouting
but
believe
me
there
many
a
girl
wears
a
sailor
hat
who
screams
when
she
gets
in
a
boat
anyway
i
not
going
to
be
knocking
anybody
well
the
next
day
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
mean
the
next
night
early
in
the
morning
i
mean
when
it
was
just
getting
light
after
the
night
after
the
next
day
we
got
to
catskill
landing
and
oh
boy
was
i
glad
we
tied
the
houseboat
to
an
old
pier
maybe
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
above
the
regular
landing
and
had
a
good
swim
and
then
breakfast
before
we
started
up
to
camp
ellsworth
let
skinny
go
in
but
he
told
him
to
be
careful
not
to
disobey
his
leaders
or
he
have
to
come
out
jimmy
it
was
funny
to
see
that
kid
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
about
it
but
he
seemed
to
kind
of
swim
different
from
the
other
fellows
and
he
could
help
getting
excited
they
threw
pieces
of
stick
for
him
to
get
and
he
would
swim
out
and
bring
them
in
in
his
mouth
just
like
a
dog
and
then
wait
for
more
all
anxious
like
one
thing
about
skinny
i
noticed
and
that
was
that
all
the
fellows
even
in
his
own
patrol
got
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
him
making
him
do
things
but
nobody
exactly
seemed
to
make
friends
with
him
anyway
i
guess
he
did
care
he
was
always
so
crazy
about
what
he
was
doing
even
a
lot
of
summer
people
stood
around
on
the
shore
watching
him
in
the
water
and
saying
he
was
a
wonder
i
guess
they
did
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
hey
mostly
that
the
way
it
is
with
summer
people
i
flopped
some
flapjacks
for
breakfast
and
el
sawyer
he
a
raven
hung
one
of
them
around
his
neck
for
a
souvenir
he
a
fresh
kid
maybe
you
think
it
easy
to
flop
flapjacks
i
should
worry
oh
boy
now
comes
the
best
part
of
this
whole
story
as
soon
as
we
could
get
our
stuff
into
the
duffel
bags
and
the
boat
all
tied
fast
we
started
out
on
our
hike
for
temple
camp
you
can
bet
i
always
like
to
hike
but
early
in
the
morning
oh
it
simply
great
some
fellows
can
drink
sodas
early
in
the
morning
but
i
ca
but
anyway
early
hikes
are
my
middle
name
you
know
just
when
the
sun
is
coming
up
all
red
like
and
peeking
over
the
hill
just
as
if
it
was
stalking
oh
boy
if
scouts
could
only
sneak
up
as
quiet
as
all
that
now
the
way
you
get
to
temple
camp
is
to
hike
up
through
catskill
village
till
you
get
to
the
old
turnpike
road
and
then
go
straight
along
that
till
you
come
to
a
big
boarding
house
where
there
are
a
lot
of
people
sitting
on
the
porch
waiting
for
breakfast
or
dinner
or
supper
or
time
to
go
to
bed
then
you
hit
the
road
up
through
the
woods
till
you
come
to
a
turtle
i
guess
he
is
there
now
but
anyway
he
was
there
last
year
then
you
cut
up
through
the
woods
and
follow
the
scouts
signs
and
you
come
out
at
leeds
that
a
village
you
see
all
the
summer
people
waiting
for
their
mail
at
the
post
office
some
of
them
will
say
oh
there
go
some
boy
scouts
are
they
cute
they
always
say
that
there
a
stationery
store
there
too
where
you
can
buy
fishhooks
and
marshmallows
and
other
things
to
eat
i
do
mean
you
eat
fishhooks
anyway
you
go
down
main
street
till
you
come
to
a
smell
like
rotten
wood
and
then
you
turn
in
where
the
willow
trees
are
and
you
come
to
an
old
sawmill
if
you
holloa
from
there
they
can
hear
you
at
camp
then
you
cut
through
the
woods
and
follow
the
trail
till
all
of
a
sudden
you
come
plunk
out
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
it
all
surrounded
by
woods
that
black
lake
and
believe
me
black
is
my
favorite
color
when
it
comes
to
lakes
then
you
go
across
in
the
boats
to
temple
camp
john
temple
started
temple
camp
he
rich
and
owns
a
lot
of
railroads
and
things
he
used
to
be
mad
at
the
scouts
but
after
a
while
when
he
saw
what
kind
of
fellows
scouts
are
he
got
glad
at
them
and
started
temple
camp
he
awful
grouchy
when
you
first
see
him
but
you
should
worry
about
that
once
when
he
was
out
west
about
some
railroads
he
saw
jeb
rushmore
who
was
a
trapper
and
all
that
and
he
was
getting
old
so
temple
made
him
come
to
temple
camp
to
be
camp
manager
and
live
there
oh
boy
you
going
to
see
him
in
just
a
minute
and
i
can
hardly
wait
chapter
xii
tells
all
about
our
row
on
black
lake
so
that
the
way
we
went
to
temple
camp
but
there
are
short
cuts
to
the
hudson
besides
that
when
we
got
near
to
the
lake
we
all
got
anxious
you
know
how
a
fellow
is
when
he
almost
to
a
place
he
been
thinking
about
a
lot
doc
carson
said
i
see
the
water
is
still
wet
that
was
just
to
jolly
that
because
of
the
recent
rains
i
said
the
which
artie
asked
me
you
think
you
smart
talking
about
rains
do
you
shouted
you
got
that
out
of
a
book
i
bet
there
be
a
lot
of
troops
there
this
summer
el
sawyer
said
pretty
soon
i
saw
he
was
right
too
because
five
boats
came
across
to
get
us
and
there
was
a
strange
scout
in
every
single
one
of
them
uncle
jeb
was
waiting
at
the
landing
on
the
other
side
to
meet
us
and
oh
cracky
did
it
look
good
to
see
the
big
pavilion
and
the
tents
and
patrol
cabins
upside
down
in
the
water
there
were
a
lot
of
scouts
waiting
too
and
i
could
see
the
camp
was
pretty
full
uncle
jeb
said
wall
roay
that
just
the
way

talks
slow
like

or

one
sure
thing

said
i
remember
when
one
uv
them
new
hampshire
scouts
scaled
one
uv
them
flapjacks
uv
across
the
lake
i
reckon
you
the
same
old
roay
that

mosquito
dope
in

biscuits
yer
remember
that
cracky
i
not
going
to
tell
you
anything
about
my
past
life
but
summer
before
last
up
there
boy
most
of
the
morning
we
rested
up
and
got
our
patrol
cabins
cleaned
out
and
all
fixed
up
and
in
the
afternoon
we
banged
around
and
got
acquainted
with
some
of
the
new
troops
just
before
supper
westy
and
i
went
down
for
a
swim
and
there
were
connie
bennett
and
two
or
three
of
the
elks
diving
with
skinny
a
whole
lot
of
fellows
were
standing
around
watching
most
of
them
laughed
at
skinny
but
they
all
had
to
admit
he
was
a
crackerjack
i
knew
the
elks
were
just
kind
of
showing
him
off
and
putting
him
through
a
lot
of
freak
stunts
just
to
get
their
name
up
around
the
camp
after
supper
westy
and
i
and
a
new
fellow
in
an
ohio
troop
were
rowing
around
near
the
shore
he
was
an
awful
nice
fellow
quiet
like
just
like
me
only
different
all
of
a
sudden
we
noticed
skinny
standing
on
the
shore
and
he
called
out
and
asked
us
if
we
take
him
in
better
watch
your
step
westy
said
safety
first
where
your
patrol
i
called
to
him
they
went
on
a
hike
he
called
back
can
i
go
with
you
you
go
and
ask
ellsworth
i
said
and
if
he
says
it
all
right
come
ahead
we
could
see
him
scooting
pell
mell
around
the
edge
of
the
cooking
shack
his
spindle
legs
as
thin
as
sticks
bert
winton
that
was
the
new
fellow
watched
him
kind
of
laughing
and
then
he
said
queer
little
codger
is
he
i
said
yes
he
new
and
he
came
out
of
the
slums
i
guess
never
work
in
harness
that
what
our
scoutmaster
says
swims
like
an
eel
winton
said
why
did
they
take
him
hiking
i
wonder
hanged
if
know
westy
said
he
going
to
win
them
the
swimming
badge
all
right
but
he
does
seem
to
be
friends
with
them
exactly
they
make
good
use
of
him
anyway
kind
of
a
performing
bear
hey
bert
said
something
like
that
i
told
him
i
wish
i
had
him
in
my
patrol
i
know
that
guess
he
would
fit
into
any
patrol
winton
said
he
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
an
odd
number
pretty
soon
skinny
came
running
back
shouting
for
all
he
was
worth
and
believe
me
he
did
look
like
an
odd
number
his
streaky
hair
was
all
down
over
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
were
like
a
couple
of
camp
fires
he
was
shouting
go
do
go
i
can
go
with
you
we
rowed
over
to
shore
and
as
he
climbed
in
i
could
see
that
he
was
trembling
all
over
just
for
fear
we
would
wait
for
him
i
suppose
i
was
going
to
swim
out
to
you
i
was
he
said
if
you
did
wait
you
would
want
your
scout
suit
to
get
all
wet
would
you
i
said
sit
down
and
do
be
so
excited
i
like
the
water
better
than
hiking
anyway
he
said
and
i
like
best
of
all
i
said
the
pleasure
is
mine
and
then
we
all
laughed
you
can
make
fun
of
me
all
you
want
he
said
i
do
care
i
told
them
they
could
make
fun
of
me
all
they
want
if
they
let
me
go
with
them
but
they
would
let
me
go
they
would
huh
bert
winton
said
and
he
studied
skinny
awful
funny
like
when
i
win
them
the
badge
then
they
take
me
wo
they
he
said
i
guess
so
i
told
him
i
going
to
win
the
cup
for
them
in
the
contest
too
he
said
going
to
win
it
for
them
before
i
go
home
then
i
be
friends
with
them
i
told
them
i
win
it
if
did
try
for
it
you
should
worry
about
me
i
said
i
can
swim
but
not
in
the
contest
class
and
maybe
you
not
either
so
do
be
too
sure
he
said
i
going
to
win
them
the
cup
and
i
going
to
win
them
the
badge
but
i
do
have
to
get
to
be
a
first
class
scout
guy
to
win
the
cup
i
do
it
made
of
silver
once
my
father
stole
a
lot
of
silver
it
all
fancy
that
cup
i
know
all
about
the
cup
alf
i
said
because
gee
i
did
like
to
be
calling
him
skinny
but
do
call
the
fellows
scout
guys
just
scouts
that
enough
he
just
looked
at
me
kind
of
wild
as
if
he
did
understand
the
same
as
he
always
did
when
anybody
called
him
down
or
tried
to
tell
him
something
for
a
few
minutes
nobody
spoke
and
we
just
rowed
around
then
westy
said
so
that
their
game
is
it
i
knew
well
enough
what
he
meant
every
season
temple
offers
a
silver
cup
to
the
best
swimmer
at
temple
camp
once
temple
had
a
son
who
got
drowned
because
he
could
swim
and
that
why
he
so
interested
in
fellows
being
good
swimmers
that
silver
cup
has
got
anything
to
do
with
the
scout
swimming
badge
you
ca
win
that
anyway
they
wo
give
it
to
you
till
you
passed
your
first
class
tests
but
anybody
can
try
for
the
silver
cup
and
you
can
bet
it
a
big
honor
for
any
troop
or
patrol
to
have
that
most
always
they
have
the
contest
on
labor
day
i
said
alf
you
can
bet
i
be
glad
to
see
you
win
that
cup
but
do
forget
that
there
are
more
than
a
hundred
fellows
at
the
camp
some
of
the
troops
come
from
the
seashore
you
know
that
and
all
crackerjack
swimmers
it
comes
mighty
hard
to
be
disappointed
so
do
you
stay
awake
at
night
thinking
about
it
i
said
that
because
i
could
just
see
that
poor
kid
dreaming
about
handing
that
cup
over
to
his
patrol
leader
and
honestly
i
did
think
there
was
much
chance
for
him
pretty
soon
bert
winton
leaned
over
and
said
to
me
do
you
suppose
that
true
about
his
father
guess
so
i
told
him
he
does
seem
to
be
very
much
ashamed
of
it
he
said
all
i
could
say
was
he
a
queer
kid
he
all
the
time
blurting
out
things
like
that
maybe
it
because
he
just
plain
honest
winton
said
but
you
think
he
be
ashamed
i
told
him
he
just
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
kind
of
funny
at
skinny
i
had
a
kind
of
a
hunch
that
he
liked
him
and
believed
in
him
anyway
i
remembered
those
words
plain
chapter
xiii
tells
about
the
strange
campers
it
was
nice
rowing
around
there
in
the
dark
it
was
so
very
dark
though
because
the
moon
was
out
and
you
could
see
it
in
the
water
just
as
plain
as
if
it
had
fallen
kerflop
out
of
the
sky
and
was
laying
in
the
bottom
of
the
lake
over
on
shore
we
could
see
the
getting
started
and
black
figures
going
toward
it
and
the
blaze
was
upside
down
in
the
water
how
about
westy
said
we
should
worry
about
i
told
him
there
plenty
of
time
wait
till
it
gets
to
blazing
up
good
and
high
it
fine
out
here
bert
winton
said
i
always
take
a
row
before
going
in
to
we
should
worry
about
you
too
i
heard
somebody
say
and
then
a
lot
of
fellows
began
laughing
by
that
i
knew
they
had
heard
everything
we
said
winton
said
funny
how
clear
you
can
people
talk
when
they
on
the
water
pretty
soon
we
were
away
over
at
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
it
was
awfully
still
and
even
our
oars
seemed
to
make
a
lot
of
noise
dripping
the
water
all
of
a
sudden
westy
said
there
a
canoe
we
could
only
just
see
it
as
it
went
gliding
by
us
but
i
noticed
there
were
two
dark
figures
in
it
winton
said
shh
wait
till
they
pass
us
then
i
tell
you
about
them
i
bet
they
evil
cronies
i
said
like
they
usually
have
in
books
because
you
know
how
it
is
in
books
there
are
always
a
couple
of
bad
fellows
that
wo
join
the
good
ones
but
go
camping
right
near
them
and
make
a
lot
of
trouble
for
them
hanged
if
i
see
why
they
join
in
with
them
and
be
done
with
it
hey
pretty
soon
winton
said
very
low
they
a
couple
of
millionaire
campers
young
fellows
their
people
are
staying
near
leeds
and
those
fellows
have
got
a
tent
right
across
there
in
the
woods
near
the
shore
they
having
the
time
of
their
lives
with
an
oil
stove
and
a
couple
of
fireless
cookers
and
some
thermos
bottles
and
things
they
got
cushions
with
buckskin
fringe
presents
from
dearie
and
sweetie
i
suppose
and
they
got
a
cedar
chest
with
brass
hinges
regular
modern
daniel
boones
they
are
oh
me
oh
my
westy
whispered
have
they
got
jackknives
hanging
from
their
belts
right
the
first
time
bert
winton
said
and
leather
cases
of
writing
paper
i
said
just
for
fun
everything
except
a
burglar
alarm
and
a
telephone
bert
said
but
they
not
half
bad
chaps
we
row
over
and
see
them
some
day
they
have
wild
times
around
their
telling
yarns
and
watching
the
roaring
blaze
in
their
oil
stove
they
got
a
fancy
indian
blanket
you
ought
to
see
it
one
of
them
paddled
over
to
camp
one
day
and
wanted
to
buy
a
fishing
rod
he
had
about
a
hundred
dollars
with
him
he
could
even
swim
night
i
said
then
all
of
a
sudden
skinny
piped
up
if
i
had
a
hundred
dollars
buy
a
canoe
i
would
i
have
it
painted
red
i
have
a
sail
for
it
too
then
all
the
fellows
would
like
me
would
they
i
said
shh
do
shout
like
that
people
can
hear
you
all
over
the
fellows
like
you
now
do
you
worry
i
do
care
if
they
hear
me
he
said
pretty
soon
we
rowed
over
and
went
up
and
sprawled
around
gee
whiz
i
guess
the
whole
camp
was
there
one
of
the
scouts
in
a
virginia
troop
was
telling
a
yarn
about
somebody
who
had
an
adventure
at
sea
it
was
mighty
interesting
you
can
bet
and
it
kind
of
started
me
thinking
about
lieutenant
donnelle
little
i
knew
of
the
terrible
thing
that
was
going
to
happen
at
camp
the
very
next
day
right
across
from
me
i
could
see
skinny
sitting
near
ellsworth
but
the
rest
of
the
elks
were
sprawling
around
with
the
ravens
one
thing
my
patrol
always
sticks
together
skinny
eyes
looked
awful
big
and
wild
kind
of
with
the
fire
shining
right
in
his
face
and
it
made
me
feel
kind
of
spooky
to
look
at
him
poor
kid
little
he
knew
what
he
was
going
to
go
through
anyway
i
wished
that
the
elks
would
call
him
over
to
them
probably
he
was
thinking
about
how
he
was
going
to
win
them
the
silver
cup
hey
chapter
xiv
tells
about
the
storm
on
black
lake
one
thing
i
have
to
admit
and
that
is
that
ellsworth
helped
me
a
lot
with
this
chapter
and
the
next
one
too
but
just
the
same
both
of
them
are
by
me
all
right
it
a
funny
thing
but
all
that
night
i
was
dreaming
about
that
canoe
with
the
two
fellows
in
it
i
could
hear
them
paddling
just
as
clear
as
could
be
only
when
i
woke
up
before
daylight
i
knew
it
was
just
the
sound
of
rain
on
the
roof
of
our
patrol
cabin
it
was
dripping
into
the
rain
ditch
i
guess
pretty
soon
i
went
to
sleep
again
and
i
could
see
skinny
standing
in
front
of
me
and
his
eyes
were
staring
and
his
face
was
all
white
and
there
was
some
blood
on
it
and
he
said
i
want
to
be
a
silver
fox
because
my
father
stole
a
lot
of
silver
so
have
i
got
a
right
to
be
i
tried
to
answer
him
but
there
was
a
loud
noise
and
he
hear
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
woke
up
and
i
knew
the
noise
was
thunder
and
skinny
was
there
at
all
anyway
it
made
me
feel
kind
of
creepy
and
i
was
glad
when
i
saw
him
at
breakfast
all
that
morning
it
rained
and
most
of
the
scouts
stayed
in
their
tents
and
cabins
some
of
them
played
basketball
in
the
pavilion
three
fellows
from
the
boston
troop
went
out
fishing
but
they
had
to
come
in
it
was
raining
so
hard
before
dinnertime
uncle
jeb
called
some
of
us
to
move
the
mess
boards
into
the
pavilion
because
it
was
beginning
to
blow
from
the
east
and
the
awnings
and
thatch
roofs
over
the
mess
boards
did
keep
the
rain
off
because
it
blew
sideways
out
on
the
lake
the
water
was
churning
up
rough
with
little
white
caps
jiminy
i
never
saw
it
like
that
before
it
was
so
dark
and
rainy
that
a
fellow
could
read
even
anyway
could
because
oh
i
do
know
i
felt
queer
kind
of
a
lot
of
us
sat
on
the
wide
porch
of
the
pavilion
the
side
facing
the
lake
it
was
wide
enough
so
the
rain
did
come
in
and
wet
us
as
long
as
we
stayed
way
back
near
the
windows
we
sat
in
a
long
row
with
our
chairs
tilted
back
it
was
nice
there
somebody
said
that
looks
lonely
sticking
out
into
the
lake
look
how
the
drops
jump
off
it
just
like
fellows
diving
not
much
of
a
day
for
the
race
doc
carson
said
what
race
shouted
the
human
race
doc
said
no
sooner
said
than
stung
we
were
just
starting
to
jolly
because
that
our
favorite
indoor
sport
when
somebody
said
there
one
of
the
gold
dust
twins
out
he
must
be
crazy
he
comes
from
maine
another
fellow
said
i
guess
he
a
maniac
but
anyway
it
was
no
joke
that
was
sure
away
over
near
the
other
side
of
the
lake
we
could
see
the
canoe
bobbing
up
and
down
and
it
seemed
to
be
coming
toward
us
only
one
of
them
is
in
it
i
said
and
that
one
too
much
on
a
day
like
this
that
pair
are
sure
nutty
doc
said
but
just
the
same
the
canoe
came
along
and
one
of
those
campers
was
sitting
in
the
stern
paddling
it
he
was
having
a
pretty
hard
job
i
could
see
that
but
maybe
it
was
as
dangerous
as
it
looked
because
if
you
know
how
to
manage
a
canoe
it
better
than
an
old
tub
of
a
boat
in
bad
weather
he
making
it
all
right
one
of
the
fellows
said
he
game
sure
pretty
soon
he
came
alongside
the
landing
and
turned
his
canoe
over
to
let
the
water
out
and
then
came
up
to
the
pavilion
pretty
wet
he
said
you
said
something
westy
answered
him
you
took
a
big
chance
coming
over
i
sure
have
been
drowned
if
i
come
he
laughed
i
wonder
if
you
fellows
can
sell
us
a
shovel
our
tent
is
floating
i
had
to
laugh
because
that
always
the
one
thing
that
most
campers
who
are
used
to
it
forget
about
i
mean
digging
a
drain
ditch
outside
their
tent
and
the
first
time
it
rains
night
they
get
drowned
out
like
rats
i
thought
he
was
a
pretty
nice
kind
of
a
fellow
only
he
was
one
tenderfoot
that
was
sure
he
had
a
swell
bathing
suit
on
with
one
of
those
waterproof
mackinaw
jackets
over
it
i
guess
his
people
were
rich
all
right
and
i
suppose
that
why
the
fellows
at
camp
called
the
pair
the
gold
dust
twins
he
took
some
bills
out
of
his
pocket
and
said
we
want
to
buy
a
shovel
you
ca
dig
a
trench
with
a
canoe
paddle
there
fine
swimming
in
our
tent
then
bert
winton
said
kind
of
quiet
in
that
way
he
had
i
do
think
you
need
any
money
here
i
get
hold
of
one
of
the
scoutmasters
and
he
started
down
the
steps
just
then
i
noticed
skinny
standing
on
the
steps
and
bert
winton
gave
him
a
push
just
for
fun
as
he
went
by
come
on
in
out
of
the
rain
alf
i
said
because
i
knew
he
was
just
hanging
there
because
he
was
afraid
to
come
up
where
the
rest
of
us
were
i
asked
him
where
his
patrol
was
and
he
said
in
the
cabin
playing
checkers
i
said
do
know
how
to
play
checkers
and
he
said
no
after
that
i
did
notice
him
pretty
soon
the
gold
dust
twin
came
back
with
a
shovel
and
elting
who
is
resident
trustee
was
with
him
telling
him
he
better
not
go
back
across
the
lake
on
account
of
its
blowing
up
harder
i
could
never
get
around
through
the
woods
he
said
because
i
tried
it
some
of
these
boys
will
show
you
the
trail
elting
said
but
he
said
no
and
that
as
long
as
he
came
he
was
going
to
go
back
he
said
he
did
want
any
escort
he
was
pretty
game
that
was
one
sure
thing
i
guess
maybe
he
felt
sort
of
ashamed
to
have
boy
scouts
show
him
the
way
because
he
was
older
than
most
of
us
anyway
he
started
back
and
we
sat
there
watching
him
and
pretty
soon
it
seemed
as
if
a
kind
of
a
screen
was
behind
him
the
rain
was
so
thick
and
there
was
so
much
mist
it
made
him
look
sort
of
like
a
ghost
or
a
you
know
a
spectre
then
all
of
a
sudden
artie
van
arlen
hat
blew
off
and
i
heard
a
branch
of
a
tree
crack
where
is
the
canoe
doc
said
all
excited
do
you
see
it
we
looked
all
over
but
could
see
him
anywhere
that
was
just
how
quickly
it
happened
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
could
hear
a
voice
but
i
could
hear
it
plain
because
the
wind
was
blowing
the
other
way
and
the
rain
was
making
such
a
racket
on
the
porch
roof
the
voice
was
all
mixed
up
with
the
wind
and
it
sounded
spooky
and
gave
me
the
creeps
for
a
couple
of
seconds
nobody
said
anything
chapter
xv
tells
about
an
accident
the
next
thing
i
knew
there
was
a
loud
splash
and
i
heard
the
down
on
the
shore
crack
and
when
i
looked
there
i
could
see
it
jumping
up
and
down
i
knew
what
that
meant
who
dived
westy
shouted
he
must
be
crazy
he
ca
make
it
hurry
up
let
get
a
boat
out
do
you
hear
the
voice
now
after
that
everything
seemed
to
happen
all
in
a
jumble
westy
and
doc
and
i
ran
to
the
landing
and
got
one
of
the
boats
off
while
the
fellows
up
on
the
porch
shouted
to
the
fellow
who
had
dived
to
come
back
because
he
could
make
it
i
heard
one
fellow
yell
crazy
come
back
while
you
can
they
getting
a
boat
out
i
was
so
busy
helping
to
push
the
boat
into
deep
water
that
i
think
any
more
about
the
fellow
who
dived
only
i
supposed
he
must
have
turned
back
i
heard
the
fellows
shouting
but
i
did
pay
any
attention
out
on
the
lake
i
could
hear
the
voice
now
calling
help
and
it
sounded
creepy
like
a
person
trying
to
call
while
he
gargling
doc
said
it
all
up
with
him
hurry
anyway
it
was
pretty
hard
getting
the
boat
started
because
the
wind
kept
blowing
it
ashore
and
we
had
to
pull
and
tug
for
all
we
were
worth
i
got
in
back
of
it
and
shoved
out
till
i
was
beyond
my
depth
then
jumped
in
while
dock
and
westy
pulled
for
all
they
were
worth
trying
to
get
her
ahead
i
guess
most
everybody
at
the
camp
was
up
on
the
porch
by
now
and
there
were
a
lot
crowding
on
the
pull
hard
doc
said
the
next
cry
will
be
the
last
one
i
know
the
sound
just
then
we
heard
a
long
cry
but
it
did
say
any
word
just
h
e
e
and
then
it
stopped
doc
said
pull
hard
anyway
you
steer
her
roy
right
over
there
a
little
to
the
left
you
can
see
the
canoe
i
looked
over
there
and
saw
it
upset
and
no
one
was
near
it
i
ca
tell
you
all
about
what
happened
i
tried
and
tore
up
three
pages
because
it
makes
me
all
excited
myself
as
you
might
say
i
can
hear
that
crowd
on
the
porch
shouting
just
as
plain
as
on
that
very
day
it
happened
and
every
time
it
rains
and
it
dark
and
windy
it
reminds
me
of
it
too
the
next
thing
i
knew
we
were
right
close
beside
two
fellows
and
westy
was
holding
them
and
shouting
go
i
got
him
the
fellow
who
would
let
go
was
skinny
i
ca
tell
you
about
how
he
looked
honest
i
just
ca
tell
you
but
there
was
blood
on
his
face
just
the
same
as
i
saw
in
the
dream
as
sure
as
i
sitting
here
there
was
he
had
hold
of
the
camping
fellow
mackinaw
jacket
with
his
teeth
and
the
fellow
mouth
was
stretched
wide
open
and
skinny
hand
was
clutching
his
teeth
and
chin
and
holding
his
head
above
water
that
way
it
was
like
any
rule
for
holding
a
drowning
fellow
anyway
no
rule
ever
heard
of
even
now
i
can
see
that
skinny
little
white
hand
straining
to
hold
that
mouth
and
chin
and
afterward
i
saw
how
there
was
a
cut
across
fingers
where
the
fellow
teeth
had
pressed
skinny
arm
was
shaking
just
like
a
rope
shakes
when
it
pulled
too
tight
and
his
eyes
were
staring
crazy
while
i
kept
the
boat
steady
doc
leaned
out
and
pressed
skinny
jaws
so
as
to
make
his
teeth
let
go
and
even
then
when
we
dragged
him
in
over
the
stern
he
had
a
piece
of
mackinaw
jacket
in
his
mouth
i
said
skinny
do
act
crazy
he
saved
but
he
only
sat
on
the
back
seat
trembling
all
over
as
if
he
had
a
fit
it
was
because
he
was
cold
it
was
just
because
he
was
excited
and
crazy
like
i
did
notice
the
camping
fellow
much
after
i
saw
that
he
was
alive
and
that
doc
had
him
breathing
all
right
westy
took
the
oars
but
i
could
help
him
on
account
of
skinny
and
i
could
do
much
for
skinny
either
he
was
gone
clean
out
of
his
head
and
started
screaming
did
it
i
did
it
i
said
yes
you
did
it
try
to
be
quiet
and
get
rested
now
ca
you
see
he
all
right
i
held
him
up
till
you
came
he
panted
i
a
hero
i
want
to
go
and
be
all
by
myself
i
do
i
said
hsh
skinny
listen
he
called
me
skinny
shouted
called
out
loud
i
know
i
said
and
you
went
sure
you
a
hero
but
of
course
i
knew
the
fellow
never
called
him
at
all
anyway
maybe
the
wind
made
it
sound
that
way
to
him
he
just
sat
there
shaking
all
over
and
staring
wild
three
times
he
panted
out
and
that
the
last
i
i
got
my
hand
in
his
mouth
before
before
he
said
it
i
did
that
the
way
murderers
do
it
is
i
did
it
even
i
know
how
to
strangle
i
do
i
a
hero
i
said
listen
here
alf
you
a
wonder
i
i
i
could
you
if
i
wanted
to
he
screamed
i
can
do
anything
i
can
sneak
stalk
i
can
take
things
out
of
your
pocket
i
can
choke
people
i
that
just
the
way
he
went
on
and
i
saw
he
had
gone
all
to
pieces
maybe
from
the
strain
and
did
know
what
he
was
saying
i
just
put
my
arm
around
him
and
i
could
feel
that
he
was
shaking
all
over
but
it
was
anything
like
a
chill
he
kept
saying
i
want
to
be
alone
by
myself
now
i
said
alf
listen
a
minute
you
can
go
and
be
alone
by
yourself
you
can
go
in
our
patrol
cabin
and
i
chase
all
the
fellows
out
i
know
how
you
feel
it
was
wonderful
alf
try
to
get
quieted
down
now
you
saved
him
i
i
can
he
said
i
said
yes
i
know
but
try
to
take
it
easy
now
because
we
coming
to
shore
you
have
to
act
like
a
real
hero
but
as
soon
as
we
came
into
shallow
water
he
jumped
out
of
the
boat
and
scooted
around
the
edge
of
the
pavilion
like
a
wild
animal
in
a
couple
of
seconds
everybody
in
camp
was
around
the
boat
waiting
to
hear
what
the
camp
doctor
said
as
soon
as
i
knew
that
the
fellow
was
going
to
be
all
right
i
went
away
to
find
skinny
no
one
else
seemed
to
miss
him
pretty
soon
i
heard
a
voice
calling
what
your
hurry
blakeley
and
i
turned
around
and
saw
bert
winton
hurrying
to
catch
up
to
me
i
going
to
look
for
that
kid
i
said
for
about
half
a
minute
we
walked
along
together
and
then
he
said
kind
of
quiet
sort
of
do
you
think
he
crazy
i
do
think
he
exactly
crazy
i
said
but
he
all
gone
to
pieces
he
sounded
crazy
from
the
shore
he
said
he
did
know
what
he
was
saying
anybody
could
tell
that
i
answered
him
what
did
he
do
winton
asked
me
oh
he
just
nearly
killed
him
trying
to
save
him
i
said
hmph
winton
said
he
be
all
right
i
told
him
most
of
the
fellows
here
think
he
crazy
he
said
last
night
they
could
hear
him
way
out
on
the
lake
boasting
about
his
father
stealing
silver
keep
your
watch
under
your
pillow
and
let
uncle
jeb
take
care
of
your
coin
that
what
all
the
fellows
are
saying
is
that
what
saying
i
said
i
not
saying
anything
he
shot
back
you
saw
what
he
just
did
i
told
him
i
saw
what
he
just
did
he
said
you
do
seem
to
be
very
excited
about
it
i
shot
back
at
him
again
what
the
good
of
getting
excited
he
said
do
think
he
crazy
and
a
thief
i
asked
him
i
think
he
may
be
a
little
crazy
at
times
he
said
as
to
being
a
thief
and
then
he
screwed
his
mouth
up
but
did
say
anything
more
a
i
said
kind
of
sarcastic
for
the
way
he
talked
made
me
mad
he
sure
a
hero
he
said
i
glad
you
think
so
i
told
him
heroes
are
usually
thieves
are
they
not
as
a
rule
he
said
kind
of
quiet
and
all
the
while
kicking
a
stone
well
then
i
said
well
then
he
said
too
well
then
there
you
are
i
spoke
up
well
then
here
we
are
he
said
with
an
awful
funny
smile
and
the
question
is
where
is
the
little
skinny
fellow
i
guess
i
can
find
him
without
any
help
from
you
i
said
then
he
walked
away
cracky
maybe
i
could
understand
skinny
very
well
but
i
sure
could
understand
bert
winton
at
all
chapter
xvi
tells
about
skinny
absence
i
hunted
for
skinny
for
a
couple
of
hours
but
i
could
find
him
i
went
all
the
way
into
leeds
for
i
could
think
where
else
he
be
if
he
was
around
camp
but
he
was
in
the
village
that
was
sure
and
i
began
to
get
kind
of
anxious
because
i
knew
the
crazy
state
he
was
in
and
besides
he
was
soaked
from
being
in
the
lake
it
cleared
up
nice
and
sunny
while
i
was
gone
and
when
i
got
back
to
camp
everybody
was
getting
ready
for
supper
i
had
to
change
my
clothes
they
were
so
wet
and
while
i
was
doing
it
ellsworth
came
into
our
cabin
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
where
skinny
was
i
said
no
i
do
i
hiked
all
over
looking
for
him
but
i
find
him
that
how
i
got
so
wet
i
should
think
connie
would
have
his
patrol
out
hunting
for
him
ellsworth
and
i
walked
over
to
supper
together
and
he
seemed
kind
of
worried
i
afraid
this
thing
has
jarred
his
balance
a
little
that
what
he
said
one
reason
he
wants
to
be
alone
i
said
is
because
he
has
got
any
friends
i
think
his
patrol
is
very
proud
of
him
he
said
the
whole
camp
is
proud
of
him
they
proud
of
what
he
they
could
help
being
proud
of
it
i
said
but
they
not
proud
of
why
do
they
take
him
in
and
make
friends
with
him
he
won
the
gold
cross
for
them
gee
the
least
they
can
do
is
to
show
some
interest
in
him
are
they
ashamed
of
him
they
do
even
trust
him
that
what
think
ellsworth
said
yes
he
won
the
gold
cross
for
them
no
doubt
of
that
yes
i
said
and
where
is
he
now
he
gone
off
so
he
can
be
alone
one
fellow
around
here
says
everybody
in
camp
thinks
he
a
thief
oh
i
guess
he
did
say
just
that
roy
ellsworth
said
very
nice
like
but
we
got
to
have
a
little
talk
with
skinny
about
the
way
he
talks
the
things
he
says
he
a
very
queer
youngster
they
see
he
different
from
the
rest
of
us
that
he
out
of
the
slums
and
well
they
do
understand
him
that
all
he
just
blurts
everything
out
i
said
that
all
well
he
ellsworth
laughed
especially
when
he
out
on
the
lake
his
tirade
after
the
rescue
sounded
very
strange
the
boys
are
not
used
to
hearing
talk
about
picking
pockets
and
stealing
silverware
they
do
understand
it
i
should
worry
about
them
i
said
skinny
just
a
kind
of
a
freak
look
at
the
way
he
wanted
to
go
away
and
be
alone
by
himself
that
prove
it
well
ellsworth
said
it
will
be
more
to
the
point
if
he
comes
back
all
right
it
would
be
more
to
the
point
if
the
elks
were
out
hunting
for
him
i
said
you
can
bet
i
was
afraid
to
say
it
to
ellsworth
or
anybody
else
i
think
we
have
to
organize
a
search
if
he
does
show
up
soon
ellsworth
said
then
neither
of
us
said
anything
for
a
few
seconds
how
about
the
camping
fellow
i
asked
him
they
took
him
home
in
a
skiff
ellsworth
said
he
wanted
to
go
so
three
of
the
boys
rowed
him
across
after
the
weather
cleared
i
do
see
how
skinny
held
him
up
i
just
do
i
told
ellsworth
ellsworth
said
no
it
was
marvelous
any
way
you
look
at
it
i
think
skinny
nearly
broke
the
poor
fellow
jaw
there
is
wonderful
power
in
frantic
desperation
anyway
at
supper
all
the
fellows
were
shouting
about
skinny
everybody
said
he
have
the
gold
cross
even
uncle
jeb
and
elting
and
you
never
hear
elting
saying
much
about
those
things
till
he
sure
all
the
elks
were
shouting
about
the
gold
cross
and
where
they
keep
it
just
as
if
it
was
theirs
hardly
any
of
them
said
anything
about
skinny
at
it
was
just
the
same
only
more
so
and
i
noticed
across
the
fire
that
ellsworth
and
a
couple
of
the
scoutmasters
were
talking
together
and
i
guessed
they
were
deciding
about
getting
a
searching
party
started
pretty
soon
bert
winton
came
over
and
squatted
down
alongside
of
me
kind
of
hot
on
the
other
side
he
said
flame
blows
right
in
your
face
these
fellows
all
in
your
patrol
i
told
him
yes
and
then
i
said
mostly
we
hang
together
good
idea
he
said
any
news
of
the
little
codger
could
find
him
i
said
kind
of
mad
like
guess
he
did
go
far
he
said
just
wanted
to
get
off
by
himself
and
think
it
over
natural
enough
did
hit
his
tracks
did
you
i
said
nope
stole
a
march
on
you
he
said
oh
sure
he
stole
a
couple
of
marches
i
said
maybe
he
even
stole
a
look
well
he
stole
away
winton
said
he
be
back
cracky
i
could
make
heads
or
tails
of
that
fellow
somehow
i
kind
of
liked
him
i
could
help
it
chapter
xvii
tells
about
and
skinny
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
a
fellow
shout
there
he
is
and
then
everbody
around
the
set
up
a
howl
skinny
was
standing
in
the
dark
away
from
the
fire
just
as
if
he
was
afraid
to
come
in
among
the
fellows
his
uniform
was
all
wrinkled
and
stained
and
he
looked
even
worse
than
he
did
other
times
there
was
a
long
mark
on
his
cheek
where
i
guess
the
gold
dust
twin
had
scratched
him
and
he
did
have
his
hat
or
his
shoes
he
look
much
like
pictures
you
see
of
heroes
but
he
was
all
quieted
down
that
was
one
thing
i
guess
he
was
played
out
there
he
is
the
crazy
little
indian
a
fellow
shouted
come
in
here
skinny
till
we
get
our
fists
on
you
you
won
the
gold
cross
you
little
spindle
shanks
then
a
lot
of
fellows
shouted
hurrah
for
skinny
come
here
skinny
till
we
pat
you
on
the
back
you
little
water
snake
they
did
even
seem
to
know
his
last
name
or
his
front
name
either
and
it
made
me
mad
you
trot
right
over
here
to
mamma
skinny
vic
norris
of
the
elks
shouted
we
take
care
of
the
kid
was
smiling
all
confused
as
if
he
did
know
to
do
come
ahead
over
do
be
scared
connie
bennett
shouted
so
then
skinny
went
over
kind
of
bashful
and
staring
all
around
him
and
sat
down
with
the
elk
patrol
westy
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
me
you
beat
that
his
own
patrol
leader
telling
him
not
to
be
afraid
to
go
and
sit
down
with
his
own
patrol
i
fix
that
bunch
he
said
then
he
stood
right
up
and
shouted
oh
boy
you
ought
to
have
heard
him
he
said
let
give
three
cheers
for
alfred
mccord
of
the
bridgeboro
troop
the
second
fellow
to
win
the
gold
cross
in
his
troop
and
the
first
one
to
win
it
in
his
patrol
the
one
in
his
patrol
that
win
it
oh
boy
that
was
some
whack
well
you
should
have
heard
the
fellows
shout
for
skinny
merry
christmas
but
that
was
some
noise
they
all
stood
up
the
elks
too
and
gave
him
the
biggest
ever
heard
at
temple
camp
even
the
scoutmasters
and
the
trustees
joined
in
and
old
uncle
jeb
kept
shouting
ray
hooo
ray
cracky
you
would
have
laughed
if
you
heard
him
oh
bibbie
when
temple
camp
once
gets
started
the
west
front
in
france
is
sleepy
hollow
compared
to
it
and
oh
did
it
make
me
feel
good
to
see
skinny
he
looked
as
if
he
was
going
to
start
to
run
away
but
connie
had
him
by
the
collar
and
all
the
elks
were
laughing
and
now
i
could
see
they
were
proud
of
him
anyway
then
ellsworth
held
up
his
hand
and
as
soon
as
the
racket
died
down
he
began
to
speak
this
is
what
he
said
because
barrows
he
a
trustee
knows
shorthand
and
afterwards
he
gave
it
to
me
all
written
out
to
copy
in
our
troop
book
he
said
scouts
you
have
heard
that
speech
is
silver
and
silence
is
golden
i
think
this
kind
of
shouting
is
highest
grade
sterling
silver
it
is
chunks
of
silver
as
one
might
say
but
since
this
is
a
matter
of
the
gold
cross
i
ask
for
just
a
moment
or
two
of
golden
silence
while
i
speak
to
you
i
see
about
me
scouts
from
ohio
and
michigan
and
new
hampshire
and
hoboken
piped
out
jiminy
that
kid
is
the
limit
yes
and
hoboken
ellsworth
said
trying
not
to
laugh
i
speak
to
all
of
you
from
north
south
east
and
west
one
of
them
has
been
up
in
an
airplane
too
yelled
i
speak
to
all
scouts
here
ellsworth
said
whether
they
come
from
the
heavens
above
or
from
the
earth
beneath
or
from
the
waters
under
the
earth
that
will
include
any
scout
who
may
happen
to
have
been
in
a
submarine
will
that
do
and
he
gave
an
awful
funny
look
then
he
said
i
want
to
thank
you
all
for
the
tribute
you
have
paid
our
troop
in
its
moment
of
pride
and
honor
this
little
scout
is
brand
new
he
is
not
even
out
of
the
tenderfoot
class
and
the
gold
cross
award
for
heroism
will
be
his
i
think
that
every
scout
of
his
patrol
should
thrill
with
pride
at
this
thought
i
dare
say
we
all
find
him
a
little
strange
as
well
as
and
i
afraid
he
is
a
kind
of
law
unto
himself
if
you
understand
what
i
mean
but
this
beautiful
cross
which
will
soon
be
his
will
bring
him
closer
to
us
all
i
am
sure
it
is
said
in
our
handbook
that
a
scout
is
a
brother
to
every
other
scout
so
he
has
many
thousands
of
brothers
all
over
this
broad
land
the
gold
cross
is
very
bright
look
in
it
and
you
will
see
your
face
reflected
you
will
see
the
scout
smile
and
that
is
brighter
than
any
gold
the
best
of
all
it
reflects
honor
honor
on
him
who
wears
it
honor
on
his
patrol
on
his
troop
and
on
every
troop
and
scout
in
this
whole
great
camp
and
alfred
mccord
has
brought
us
this
honor
come
here
alf
my
boy
and
let
me
shake
your
hand
was
that
a
peach
of
an
address
but
i
noticed
that
skinny
did
move
he
just
stood
there
close
to
connie
bennett
he
was
shaking
all
over
and
he
was
smiling
and
he
was
crying
i
saw
hunt
ward
jump
up
and
give
him
a
rap
on
the
back
and
he
was
so
little
and
so
thin
that
it
kind
of
made
him
stagger
then
he
said
ca
i
stay
here
with
them
oh
boy
was
i
glad
chapter
xviii
tells
about
my
talk
with
bert
winton
believe
that
was
night
i
guess
i
knew
how
skinny
felt
when
he
scooted
off
because
after
i
felt
just
that
same
way
myself
christmas
i
do
know
how
it
feels
to
win
the
gold
cross
and
i
guess
i
never
will
either
but
just
the
same
after
that
night
i
just
felt
as
if
i
wanted
to
go
and
be
by
myself
i
ca
tell
you
why
it
fine
hanging
around
the
after
it
died
down
but
they
pretty
sure
to
chase
you
off
to
bed
if
you
do
that
it
a
danger
zone
believe
anyway
i
know
a
peach
of
a
place
on
a
big
rock
near
the
shore
you
just
go
along
under
the
and
pass
the
boat
landing
and
follow
the
path
so
i
went
there
and
pretty
soon
hunt
ward
came
along
on
his
way
to
the
elk
cabin
and
he
stopped
a
couple
of
minutes
and
talked
to
me
well
he
said
we
got
that
little
old
medal
in
our
patrol
you
got
alf
in
your
patrol
you
mean
i
said
i
do
know
whether
you
could
exactly
say
he
it
he
said
because
he
was
crazy
and
did
know
what
he
was
doing
i
wish
i
knew
some
more
fellows
who
were
crazy
like
that
i
told
him
you
seem
to
be
kind
of
sore
at
us
foxy
he
said
most
of
them
called
me
foxy
because
i
leader
of
the
silver
foxes
there
a
difference
between
a
mascot
and
a
regular
friend
i
told
him
you
fellows
treat
skinny
just
as
if
he
was
a
sort
of
a
mascot
why
do
you
take
him
in
with
you
just
like
you
would
any
other
fellow
he
a
queer
little
duck
hunt
said
that
is
any
reason
why
you
should
take
him
in
i
not
saying
you
have
and
i
glad
if
you
have
that
sure
you
ought
to
read
him
the
handbook
and
teach
him
some
of
the
other
stuff
the
laws
and
all
that
gee
that
the
least
you
could
do
now
he
won
the
cross
for
you
grandpa
foxy
he
said
and
then
he
went
along
toward
the
elk
cabin
i
was
just
going
to
start
off
to
our
own
cabin
when
i
heard
footsteps
it
seemed
as
if
someone
might
be
stealing
along
and
first
i
thought
it
might
be
skinny
i
was
glad
it
was
because
i
wanted
him
to
stay
in
with
his
own
fellows
now
and
not
bother
with
me
it
was
bert
winton
blakeley
he
said
in
that
quiet
kind
of
a
way
he
has
i
thought
everybody
was
in
bed
i
see
not
in
bed
i
told
him
kind
of
grouchy
he
said
me
oh
no
i
always
prowl
around
after
fox
trails
and
things
i
got
on
one
fox
trail
did
i
bet
the
kid
wo
sleep
hey
i
bet
i
wo
sleep
either
i
said
and
that
why
i
here
kind
of
like
the
kid
do
you
he
said
i
said
yes
and
that
more
than
can
say
he
just
looked
at
me
a
minute
and
then
he
sat
down
on
the
stone
alongside
of
me
and
he
broke
a
stick
off
a
bush
and
began
marking
on
the
ground
with
it
then
he
said
kind
of
as
if
he
did
take
much
interest
he
said
actions
speak
louder
than
words
did
you
ever
hear
that
sure
i
said
but
i
like
to
know
what
that
has
to
do
with
skinny
he
just
kept
pushing
the
stick
around
then
he
said
if
you
such
a
good
friend
of
his
instead
of
trotting
all
around
and
sticking
your
face
into
every
cabin
like
an
old
maid
hunting
for
a
thimble
why
did
you
find
his
trail
and
follow
it
i
said
i
do
know
why
i
did
if
you
thought
he
just
went
off
to
be
by
himself
why
did
you
trail
him
and
make
sure
he
asked
me
all
the
while
very
friendly
and
quiet
like
well
if
he
wanted
to
be
by
himself
i
said
why
should
i
track
him
why
should
you
hunt
for
him
at
all
then
he
said
just
because
i
choose
to
i
told
him
that
a
good
reason
he
said
it
all
the
reason
you
get
i
blurted
out
all
right
he
said
very
nice
and
polite
only
then
do
go
around
thinking
you
a
better
friend
to
him
than
i
am
i
know
this
camp
and
i
know
those
fellows
across
the
lake
and
i
know
page
of
the
handbook
and
i
seen
the
kid
once
or
twice
i
suppose
you
think
i
do
know
what
on
page
of
the
handbook
i
said
getting
mad
it
the
tracking
badge
pathfinding
so
there
and
i
see
you
have
it
on
your
sleeve
too
that
where
it
belongs
he
said
well
then
if
you
think
it
was
so
important
to
track
him
why
you
track
him
i
blurted
at
him
for
i
was
good
and
mad
i
did
he
said
chapter
xix
tells
about
a
visit
from
across
the
lake
now
at
last
i
knew
for
sure
that
i
hated
that
fellow
and
i
said
to
myself
you
can
bet
i
never
have
anything
more
to
do
with
when
i
got
to
our
cabin
all
the
fellows
were
asleep
except
westy
and
i
said
to
him
do
you
know
that
scout
who
patrol
leader
in
the
ohio
troop
he
said
you
mean
winton
that
him
i
said
i
hate
him
so
much
that
it
makes
me
hate
the
whole
state
of
ohio
i
would
even
go
canoeing
on
the
ohio
river
he
did
say
anything
i
guess
he
was
sleepy
i
even
hate
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
i
said
the
next
morning
just
as
we
were
going
in
for
a
swim
we
saw
the
canoe
coming
across
the
lake
again
when
it
got
near
enough
we
could
see
that
another
fellow
was
in
it
we
all
went
over
to
the
landing
to
ask
him
how
his
pal
was
getting
along
right
away
he
asked
if
he
could
see
ellsworth
i
said
sure
you
can
i
guess
he
in
the
tepee
writing
i
felt
sort
of
glad
because
i
thought
probably
it
meant
something
good
for
skinny
all
morning
he
was
sure
one
hero
and
at
the
time
the
camper
came
he
was
off
with
the
elks
somewhere
stalking
i
guess
and
i
was
mighty
glad
of
it
the
tepee
is
a
little
tent
where
the
scoutmasters
always
go
when
they
want
to
be
alone
so
as
to
write
up
troop
stuff
nobody
ever
bothers
them
in
there
unless
it
important
and
even
then
only
one
fellow
goes
i
said
sure
come
ahead
i
find
him
for
you
he
was
a
pretty
nice
fellow
i
could
see
that
even
if
he
a
tenderfoot
and
he
spoke
mighty
friendly
sort
of
to
me
he
said
you
have
a
wonderful
little
life
saver
here
with
a
bull
dog
grip
it
more
than
a
grip
i
said
it
a
regular
suitcase
he
going
to
get
the
highest
award
we
have
too
bully
for
him
he
said
we
going
to
let
him
know
what
we
think
about
it
too
scouts
are
allowed
to
take
anything
for
things
like
that
i
told
him
well
he
said
we
heard
him
shouting
on
the
lake
the
other
night
that
he
like
to
own
a
canoe
so
we
going
to
give
him
ours
when
we
go
away
next
week
oh
boy
i
said
then
i
just
happened
to
think
to
say
did
you
hear
all
he
shouted
out
on
the
lake
because
i
said
he
kind
of
kind
of
freakish
sometimes
he
a
little
wonder
that
what
he
is
he
said
when
we
got
to
the
tepee
ellsworth
jumped
up
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
glad
to
see
you
sit
down
sit
down
too
roy
so
we
both
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
i
do
know
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
fellow
was
sort
of
uncomfortable
as
if
he
rather
i
be
there
but
he
did
say
anything
about
it
ellsworth
said
your
friend
had
a
very
narrow
escape
canoes
are
bad
things
in
storms
you
should
be
careful
and
then
he
gave
him
some
mighty
good
advice
in
that
nice
way
he
has
the
camping
fellow
said
he
come
to
thank
the
little
fellow
what
he
called
him
and
to
tell
ellsworth
how
they
both
felt
about
it
he
said
they
never
forget
about
it
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
there
was
anything
they
could
do
absolutely
nothing
ellsworth
said
all
awards
and
tokens
of
recognition
are
attended
to
right
here
among
ourselves
for
about
half
a
minute
the
fellow
did
say
anything
and
i
thought
he
was
thinking
about
how
to
spring
that
about
the
canoe
because
it
was
easy
after
what
ellsworth
said
then
he
said
i
can
tell
you
almost
just
the
very
words
because
ellsworth
helped
me
with
this
part
he
said
there
a
little
matter
i
want
to
speak
about
ellsworth
and
it
is
easy
my
friend
did
want
me
to
speak
about
it
at
all
for
he
was
afraid
you
might
misunderstand
us
ellsworth
said
awful
friendly
like
i
will
try
not
to
then
he
said
kind
of
smiling
i
suppose
we
can
trust
this
good
little
scout
not
to
repeat
out
talk
to
anyone
ellsworth
began
to
laugh
then
he
said
oh
yes
indeed
all
good
little
scouts
are
to
be
trusted
that
what
roy
here
would
say
is
their
middle
name
am
i
right
roy
i
guess
that
made
it
kind
of
easy
for
the
fellow
for
he
started
right
in
though
i
could
see
it
was
hard
for
him
to
say
it
he
said
my
pal
had
quite
a
little
sum
of
money
in
his
jacket
which
we
ca
seem
to
find
now
it
was
buttoned
into
a
flap
pocket
he
thought
or
rather
thought
that
perhaps
it
had
been
taken
from
him
and
laid
away
for
safe
keeping
or
perhaps
it
may
have
fallen
into
the
water
and
gone
down
there
a
lot
of
valuable
stuff
under
the
water
these
days
i
think
he
said
that
just
so
to
kind
of
make
a
joke
about
what
he
was
saying
so
as
maybe
it
would
seem
so
serious
like
anyway
he
was
awfully
trice
it
seems
pretty
contemptible
to
be
talking
about
money
he
said
after
my
pal
life
was
saved
by
you
folks
but
it
just
because
the
money
has
to
be
paid
out
pretty
soon
that
he
worrying
about
it
he
did
want
me
to
come
over
and
ask
but
i
told
him
i
was
going
to
anyway
no
harm
in
that
i
guess
none
whatever
ellsworth
said
how
much
money
was
there
the
fellow
said
a
little
over
two
hundred
but
they
were
sure
exactly
how
much
ellsworth
raised
his
eyebrows
in
that
way
he
has
and
said
that
a
good
deal
of
money
for
two
young
fellows
to
take
camping
the
camper
said
yes
i
guess
it
is
but
we
pretty
punk
campers
i
suppose
any
way
you
look
at
it
ellsworth
said
just
wait
a
minute
and
he
went
away
the
camping
fellow
started
to
say
how
it
made
him
feel
mean
and
contemptible
to
come
over
and
ask
about
the
money
and
he
guessed
it
was
probably
in
davy
jones
locker
anyway
pretty
soon
ellsworth
came
back
and
said
i
very
sorry
my
young
friend
but
no
sum
of
money
was
found
on
your
companion
if
it
had
been
it
would
either
have
been
restored
to
him
or
held
by
the
camp
authorities
through
oversight
i
have
just
made
inquiries
of
them
the
boy
who
saved
your
friend
is
not
in
camp
at
present
but
i
think
i
can
answer
for
him
that
he
did
not
find
it
to
make
sure
i
will
ask
him
when
he
returns
and
one
of
the
boys
will
row
over
and
let
you
know
i
could
see
the
fellow
seemed
kind
of
disappointed
but
anyway
he
was
mighty
nice
about
it
chapter
xx
tells
about
the
loss
of
some
money
ellsworth
asked
me
to
come
back
and
get
some
letters
to
put
in
the
mail
box
so
after
i
saw
the
gold
dust
twin
start
off
i
went
back
to
the
tepee
and
just
as
i
was
going
inside
i
saw
connie
bennett
and
bert
mcalpin
and
hunt
ward
and
stut
moran
and
skinny
coming
down
the
hill
in
back
of
the
tepee
skinny
was
smiling
all
over
and
i
could
see
the
wrinkles
at
the
ends
of
his
mouth
like
i
always
could
when
he
smiled
that
when
you
could
see
how
thin
he
was
i
shouted
that
i
thought
ellsworth
wanted
to
see
him
and
he
started
to
run
only
connie
grabbed
him
by
the
collar
just
for
fun
and
held
him
back
i
heard
him
say
take
your
time
we
all
in
on
this
by
that
i
knew
that
skinny
expected
ellsworth
was
going
to
give
him
the
gold
cross
i
did
blame
for
thinking
so
but
the
others
might
have
had
better
sense
because
it
usually
a
week
anyway
before
an
honor
medal
comes
anyway
they
all
came
down
into
the
tepee
and
stood
looking
around
as
if
they
expected
to
see
the
gold
cross
on
the
table
hanged
if
i
think
connie
had
n
idea
that
ellsworth
would
hand
it
to
he
looked
so
important
like
ellsworth
just
went
on
and
finished
the
letter
he
was
writing
then
he
said
alfred
our
rescued
mariner
from
across
the
lake
ca
find
a
roll
of
money
he
had
in
his
mackinaw
he
thinks
it
may
have
gone
down
in
the
lake
do
happen
to
know
anything
about
it
do
you
i
have
to
admit
that
i
felt
sort
of
funny
and
i
looked
pretty
close
at
skinny
he
just
stood
there
staring
and
i
could
see
by
his
neck
that
he
was
breathing
hard
and
all
nervous
sort
of
then
ellsworth
asked
him
again
very
pleasant
like
he
always
spoke
to
him
but
skinny
say
a
word
only
stood
there
staring
and
he
gulped
as
if
he
was
trying
to
swallow
something
gee
i
was
all
kind
of
shaky
myself
now
because
i
saw
ellsworth
looked
at
him
in
a
funny
way
like
a
fellow
looks
at
the
sun
kind
of
as
if
he
was
studying
him
know
then
connie
said
why
in
the
dickens
do
you
speak
up
skinny
if
you
know
anything
about
it
why
do
you
say
so
do
you
want
to
get
us
all
in
dutch
i
could
see
that
skinny
was
just
trying
as
hard
as
he
could
to
speak
but
could
on
account
of
that
lump
in
his
throat
i
know
it
was
none
of
my
business
but
i
just
could
keep
still
any
longer
so
i
said
right
out
the
reason
he
does
speak
is
because
he
have
you
got
sense
enough
to
see
that
he
thought
ellsworth
was
going
to
hand
him
the
medal
and
you
were
crazy
enough
to
let
him
think
so
that
one
reason
he
all
rattled
so
i
answer
for
him
and
i
hope
satisfy
you
he
has
got
the
money
and
he
never
saw
it
and
he
never
heard
of
it
it
down
at
the
bottom
of
black
lake
that
where
it
is
do
you
suppose
he
had
something
better
to
do
with
himself
when
he
was
saving
that
gold
dust
twin
than
to
be
going
through
his
pockets
i
sure
i
would
vic
norris
said
i
said
you
could
even
have
held
him
up
in
the
water
and
you
know
plaguy
well
you
could
there
not
one
of
you
that
could
if
you
thought
more
about
what
he
was
doing
out
there
in
all
that
storm
with
his
teeth
in
that
fellow
sweater
and
his
hand
being
blamed
near
bitten
off
it
would
be
better
for
all
thinking
about
is
getting
the
gold
cross
into
your
patrol
what
do
you
suppose
cares
about
money
a
fellow
that
can
do
things
like
that
it
these
that
go
camping
with
a
whole
savings
bank
in
their
pockets
and
no
shovel
to
dig
a
drain
ditch
with
that
the
kind
that
think
about
money
you
make
me
sick
turn
your
pockets
inside
out
alf
and
let
them
see
what
you
got
go
ahead
all
the
while
ellsworth
kept
saying
shh
shh
roy
but
what
did
i
care
even
he
could
stop
me
what
got
to
do
with
it
anyway
connie
said
to
ellsworth
i
do
see
as
it
any
of
business
well
i
said
i
it
my
business
you
got
the
kid
so
nervous
and
scared
that
he
ca
even
find
his
pockets
he
just
a
moment
roy
ellsworth
said
you
must
forget
yourself
you
have
done
our
friends
across
the
lake
an
injustice
when
i
get
through
doing
skinny
it
will
be
time
enough
to
think
of
i
said
oh
boy
i
was
mad
ellsworth
said
we
have
no
wish
to
search
alfred
roy
why
all
this
anger
because
i
heard
enough
hints
and
insinuations
around
this
camp
that
why
i
said
jiminy
i
could
just
feel
my
voice
tremble
poor
skinny
was
fumbling
at
one
of
his
pockets
and
he
was
so
scared
and
nervous
that
he
could
get
his
hand
in
even
so
i
just
stepped
over
and
pulled
his
pocket
inside
out
illustration
i
stepped
over
and
pulled
his
pockets
inside
out
four
pennies
i
said
see
poor
but
honest
hey
alf
and
i
gave
him
a
good
rap
on
the
shoulder
i
guess
it
made
him
feel
good
because
he
smiled
at
me
even
though
he
did
look
scared
then
one
after
another
i
pulled
all
his
other
pockets
inside
out
and
last
i
turned
out
the
flap
pockets
in
his
khaki
shirt
just
as
i
did
that
a
key
fell
out
four
cents
and
a
key
i
said
now
are
you
satisfied
we
never
said
he
had
it
hunt
ward
spoke
up
well
now
you
can
see
he
has
anyway
i
said
all
the
while
ellsworth
waited
just
as
if
he
did
have
much
use
for
all
this
business
but
just
the
same
would
interfere
always
the
way
he
is
so
now
he
said
very
pleasant
i
think
we
having
a
sort
of
tempest
in
a
teapot
roy
no
one
has
made
any
accusations
suppose
you
let
me
say
a
word
it
was
at
all
necessary
to
perform
this
operation
on
alfred
let
me
see
this
key
alf
my
boy
skinny
handed
the
key
to
ellsworth
and
he
screwed
up
his
face
sort
of
funny
and
looked
at
it
then
he
said
hmph
it
a
yale
key
belonging
to
a
padlock
eh
what
key
is
it
my
boy
skinny
could
hardly
speak
he
was
so
scared
even
i
felt
sort
of
shaky
i
do
know
why
skinny
just
said
i
found
it
here
in
camp
you
mean
ellsworth
said
just
as
nice
as
i
ever
heard
him
talk
awful
pleasant
and
easy
like
on
the
boat
skinny
said
the
day
i
found
the
money
it
was
right
on
the
deck
that
was
the
money
he
gave
you
i
said
i
just
could
help
saying
it
ellsworth
said
now
roy
you
must
let
me
do
the
talking
just
be
quiet
a
minute
i
said
excuse
me
now
alf
ellsworth
said
why
did
you
give
me
this
key
eh
skinny
kept
breathing
but
could
hardly
speak
then
he
said
i
put
it
in
the
other
pocket
i
forgot
mostly
i
put
things
there
i
see
ellsworth
said
just
as
if
he
believed
every
word
you
do
know
what
key
it
is
i
suppose
alf
no
sir
he
said
and
then
he
gulped
and
seemed
terribly
scared
and
excited
all
right
ellsworth
said
just
leave
it
with
me
i
expect
i
shall
be
able
to
pin
the
cross
on
you
in
a
few
days
alf
have
a
little
patience
then
all
of
a
sudden
skinny
blurted
out
am
i
a
hero
yes
indeed
ellsworth
said
and
he
smiled
at
him
and
patted
his
shoulder
chapter
xxi
tells
about
my
talk
with
ellsworth
after
they
were
gone
ellsworth
told
me
that
i
should
get
so
excited
about
nothing
i
have
to
admit
that
the
way
i
often
do
i
said
do
you
know
what
that
a
key
to
he
said
it
a
key
to
a
padlock
i
have
an
idea
that
perhaps
it
fits
the
padlock
on
that
locker
in
the
the
one
that
was
always
locked
jiminy
i
never
thought
of
that
until
just
then
when
he
spoke
about
it
it
made
me
feel
awfully
queer
anyhow
i
guessed
right
off
that
he
was
right
because
probably
it
fell
out
of
lieutenant
donnelle
pocket
along
with
the
change
that
he
spilled
all
over
the
deck
there
was
a
kind
of
a
lump
in
throat
now
i
said
skinny
gave
you
the
money
so
we
ought
to
believe
him
when
he
says
he
just
put
the
key
in
another
pocket
and
forgot
about
it
why
surely
he
said
i
not
suspecting
him
of
anything
neither
is
anyone
else
the
only
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
how
the
key
happened
to
be
on
the
deck
where
he
found
it
we
swabbed
the
decks
so
thoroughly
before
leaving
bridgeboro
one
of
our
boys
might
have
dropped
some
change
and
never
known
it
but
how
did
the
key
happen
to
be
there
we
know
how
it
happened
in
alfred
pocket
but
how
did
it
happen
on
the
deck
we
scouts
claim
to
be
observant
and
yet
that
key
was
right
on
the
deck
from
bridgeboro
all
the
way
down
to
george
that
the
queer
thing
oh
boy
did
i
feel
guilty
especially
i
felt
guilty
because
ellsworth
was
so
nice
and
pleasant
about
it
because
all
the
while
i
knew
where
that
key
came
from
and
it
seemed
just
like
lying
not
to
tell
gee
i
was
kind
of
sorry
now
that
i
promised
lieutenant
donnelle
that
i
would
never
tell
about
him
coming
there
i
could
say
anything
so
i
just
kept
still
all
the
while
ellsworth
kept
looking
at
the
key
and
thinking
and
humming
a
tune
to
himself
pretty
soon
he
said
you
do
happen
to
know
where
alfred
went
when
he
disappeared
do
you
roy
i
said
no
i
do
all
i
know
is
i
could
find
him
he
was
gone
for
four
or
five
hours
he
said
very
slow
as
if
he
was
sort
of
thinking
i
guess
i
felt
just
about
the
same
as
skinny
did
now
anyway
i
was
all
shaky
and
it
was
hard
for
me
to
get
started
saying
anything
then
i
said
ellsworth
skinny
went
off
because
he
was
all
scared
and
excited
and
he
wanted
to
be
all
alone
by
himself
often
i
felt
that
same
way
i
felt
that
way
after
i
passed
my
second
class
tests
i
do
deny
he
kind
of
freaky
i
think
he
just
went
off
in
the
woods
you
know
yourself
it
in
the
handbook
that
trees
are
good
companions
he
just
wanted
to
be
alone
i
bet
he
was
a
hundred
yards
from
camp
skinny
kind
of
queer
you
know
that
then
ellsworth
just
laid
down
the
key
and
put
stamps
on
two
or
three
letters
and
said
all
right
roy
just
see
that
these
get
mailed
will
you
he
did
say
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
i
guessed
he
was
going
to
do
anything
and
even
suppose
he
did
what
was
the
harm
but
just
the
same
i
felt
awful
queer
and
shaky
i
guess
maybe
it
was
because
i
could
come
right
out
and
tell
him
the
plain
truth
about
that
key
chapter
xxii
tells
about
how
i
visited
the
ohio
troop
cabin
one
thing
i
was
sure
of
and
that
was
that
skinny
went
away
into
the
woods
just
to
be
alone
by
himself
like
he
said
i
knew
it
was
just
like
him
to
do
that
maybe
you
think
it
was
funny
for
him
to
do
that
when
it
was
raining
but
already
he
was
good
and
wet
you
have
to
remember
that
i
said
to
myself
i
should
worry
about
the
key
because
anyway
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
skinny
but
just
the
same
i
kept
worrying
about
something
i
do
know
just
what
pretty
soon
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
something
that
i
did
want
to
do
i
went
up
the
hill
to
where
the
ohio
troop
bunked
they
had
one
of
the
big
troop
cabins
that
holds
two
patrols
i
guess
they
were
a
pretty
fine
troop
because
they
had
everything
fixed
up
dandy
one
patrol
was
called
the
royal
bengal
tigers
and
the
other
was
called
the
african
tigers
and
both
patrols
wore
yellow
scarfs
with
black
stripes
and
all
their
scout
staffs
had
tigers
heads
on
them
even
when
they
dived
from
the
they
had
a
certain
kind
of
a
way
of
jumping
they
called
it
the
tiger
spring
and
nobody
could
get
the
hang
of
it
some
organization
they
had
that
what
ellsworth
said
every
one
of
those
fellows
had
a
tiger
claw
hung
around
his
neck
oh
boy
that
was
some
troop
for
you
i
asked
one
of
the
fellows
for
bert
winton
and
he
came
around
from
behind
the
cabin
where
he
was
spearing
papers
and
leaves
i
said
fellows
ought
to
be
called
the
gold
dust
twins
your
two
patrols
i
mean
because
you
so
plaguy
particular
picking
up
leaves
and
everything
you
be
dusting
the
roof
next
he
said
we
a
lot
of
old
maids
up
here
then
he
climbed
up
on
the
cabin
roof
and
sat
on
the
peak
and
i
scrambled
up
too
and
sat
down
alongside
of
him
honest
that
fellow
would
squat
in
the
funniest
places
and
always
he
had
a
stick
with
him
nice
and
breezy
up
here
he
said
in
that
quiet
easy
sort
of
way
he
had
and
we
can
scan
the
horizon
anything
particular
i
do
know
but
i
seemed
to
sort
of
feel
that
he
knew
what
i
was
going
to
talk
about
and
i
guess
he
just
scrambled
up
there
so
the
other
fellows
would
hear
cracky
that
fellow
always
had
his
wits
about
him
that
one
sure
thing
i
said
i
do
deny
that
i
was
kind
of
sore
at
you
when
you
spoke
to
me
down
at
the
lake
and
i
ca
tell
whether
i
like
you
or
not
because
i
can
never
make
out
what
you
really
think
you
got
to
know
what
a
fellow
thinks
before
you
know
whether
you
like
him
or
not
you
he
said
you
sure
did
and
then
he
said
well
i
know
whether
i
like
or
not
so
it
all
right
i
do
care
much
whether
you
like
i
said
it
skinny
thinking
about
i
know
i
like
you
can
bet
and
that
one
reason
i
like
you
he
said
because
you
like
ever
notice
how
the
cedar
shingles
shrink
in
a
dry
spell
i
said
i
did
know
they
were
cedar
you
can
always
tell
cedar
by
the
smell
he
said
and
the
s
warp
gee
i
did
even
know
what
an
s
warp
was
then
i
said
right
out
i
said
you
told
me
that
you
tracked
skinny
would
you
mind
telling
me
where
he
went
for
a
minute
he
just
kept
moving
the
stick
around
and
then
he
said
what
would
be
the
use
of
telling
you
because
i
got
a
reason
and
i
want
to
know
i
said
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
knew
why
he
climbed
up
there
it
was
partly
so
he
could
see
all
around
and
be
sure
no
one
was
coming
well
why
do
you
want
to
know
he
said
because
i
a
friend
of
skinny
that
why
i
said
then
i
just
blurted
out
i
might
as
well
tell
you
because
anyway
you
smarter
than
i
am
they
found
a
key
on
skinny
he
just
said
when
i
said
and
it
probably
a
key
to
one
of
the
lockers
in
our
besides
that
fellow
who
nearly
got
drowned
had
about
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
on
him
humph
i
thought
so
winton
said
i
said
why
oh
just
because
he
said
the
day
he
came
over
to
try
to
buy
a
he
had
a
roll
as
big
as
a
cobblestone
with
him
i
suspected
he
lose
it
some
day
and
that
somebody
would
get
blamed
nobody
is
getting
blamed
i
said
no
but
somebody
is
being
suspected
he
shot
back
well
he
lose
it
i
have
to
admit
that
much
i
said
and
that
all
you
ever
going
to
admit
hey
he
said
all
the
while
moving
the
stick
around
on
the
roof
that
all
i
ever
going
to
admit
i
said
bully
for
you
he
said
you
about
the
best
little
scout
i
ever
knew
next
to
skinny
i
can
stick
up
for
a
friend
that
one
thing
i
said
through
thick
and
thin
he
asked
me
in
spite
of
circumstantial
evidence
i
should
worry
about
circumstantial
evidence
i
told
him
why
should
i
care
about
circumstantial
evidence
what
did
circumstantial
evidence
ever
do
for
i
like
to
know
then
he
began
to
laugh
gee
did
know
what
he
was
laughing
at
nothing
would
shake
you
huh
he
said
believe
me
it
would
take
an
earthquake
i
told
him
he
looked
all
around
and
moved
the
stick
around
on
the
shingles
as
if
he
was
thinking
then
he
said
well
skinny
went
over
to
the
hudson
to
that
you
fellows
came
up
on
he
followed
the
old
bed
of
bowl
valley
creek
now
do
get
excited
he
had
as
much
right
to
go
there
as
you
have
he
was
all
worked
up
and
he
is
just
exactly
right
in
his
head
you
know
that
he
just
wanted
to
go
home
and
be
all
alone
by
himself
the
was
the
only
home
he
knew
i
did
go
on
the
boat
because
i
had
no
right
to
and
because
there
was
no
need
to
i
did
know
he
had
any
key
i
do
believe
he
hid
anything
if
that
what
thinking
about
i
tracked
him
because
i
wanted
to
make
sure
he
was
safe
and
know
what
he
was
doing
as
soon
as
i
saw
where
he
was
headed
for
i
just
beat
it
back
nothing
to
it
blakeley
do
worry
but
now
you
know
he
had
a
key
to
a
locker
i
said
he
just
said
well
what
of
it
i
believe
in
him
and
there
you
are
i
would
care
if
he
had
keys
to
all
the
banks
and
safe
deposit
vaults
in
the
united
states
gee
it
just
kind
of
gave
me
a
thrill
the
way
he
spoke
i
said
anyway
now
i
know
that
i
like
you
i
ought
to
have
had
sense
enough
to
know
before
then
he
said
you
see
blakeley
skinny
a
mighty
queer
little
proposition
if
it
was
for
that
scoutmaster
you
fellows
have
say
he
would
never
make
a
regular
scout
but
i
think
that
ellsworth
is
a
wonder
believe
me
you
said
something
i
told
him
you
know
yourself
he
said
how
that
kid
talks
shouts
i
mean
stealing
silver
picking
pockets
what
are
all
these
fellows
to
think
most
of
the
fellows
here
come
from
good
folks
they
do
understand
a
poor
little
codger
like
skinny
who
is
half
crazy
because
he
been
half
starved
you
know
yourself
that
he
does
fit
in
here
i
say
he
is
going
to
but
i
good
at
arithmetic
blakeley
gee
you
a
peach
on
tracking
too
i
said
well
and
i
know
how
to
put
two
and
two
together
he
said
i
knew
i
just
felt
it
in
my
bones
that
that
gold
dust
twin
with
his
swell
bathing
suit
and
his
waterproof
mackinaw
was
going
to
lose
his
roll
in
the
water
he
carried
it
loose
in
his
mackinaw
pocket
a
camper
mind
you
he
had
a
wad
big
enough
to
pay
off
the
national
debt
and
i
knew
it
would
tumble
out
and
it
did
skinny
one
of
those
poor
little
codgers
that
always
unlucky
he
happened
to
be
there
he
happened
to
have
a
key
he
happened
to
go
to
the
i
got
hold
of
his
tracks
just
because
i
did
want
him
to
come
to
any
harm
while
he
was
all
worked
up
the
reason
i
did
say
anything
about
where
he
went
was
because
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
fellows
in
this
camp
that
would
put
two
and
two
together
and
get
five
understand
they
say
he
went
to
hide
goldie
freight
shipment
of
dollar
bills
so
i
kept
still
no
harm
in
keeping
still
oh
cracky
i
said
but
i
like
you
keeping
still
about
something
too
and
you
can
bet
i
know
how
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
you
can
just
bet
i
do
anything
for
a
friend
i
would
well
skinny
got
a
good
friend
he
said
i
did
mean
skinny
i
told
him
but
he
has
got
two
good
friends
anyway
and
that
us
hey
he
just
said
that
us
and
then
he
slid
right
down
the
roof
and
jumped
off
the
edge
awful
funny
like
chapter
xxiii
tells
about
how
i
did
a
good
turn
that
night
ellsworth
was
at
and
nobody
knew
where
he
was
all
the
time
i
had
a
funny
feeling
and
i
kept
looking
away
from
the
fire
and
up
the
dark
path
to
see
if
he
was
coming
i
listening
to
the
yarns
at
all
and
that
night
i
did
sleep
i
just
kind
of
felt
that
something
was
wrong
you
know
what
i
mean
i
could
just
feel
it
in
the
air
the
next
morning
was
nice
and
bright
and
sunny
and
it
seemed
good
because
there
had
been
such
a
lot
of
rain
lately
on
my
way
over
to
breakfast
i
stopped
outside
of
council
shack
to
read
the
bulletin
board
and
see
what
was
on
for
the
day
i
saw
that
the
elks
were
going
stalking
and
i
was
glad
of
that
because
i
knew
skinny
liked
stalking
and
i
was
glad
he
was
with
them
at
last
but
just
the
same
i
felt
kind
of
funny
all
the
while
i
was
having
eats
afterward
artie
van
arlen
he
head
of
the
ravens
came
and
told
me
that
ellsworth
wanted
to
see
me
i
felt
awful
shaky
when
i
went
into
council
shack
he
was
sitting
there
all
alone
and
on
the
table
right
in
front
of
him
were
the
key
and
a
lot
of
money
all
crunched
up
oh
but
did
ellsworth
look
sober
and
serious
he
said
very
low
as
if
he
was
all
discouraged
sort
of
roy
he
said
you
said
something
about
going
home
for
your
sister
birthday
i
said
yes
sir
i
like
to
go
down
friday
and
come
back
monday
i
go
both
ways
by
train
because
that
quicker
i
wo
go
if
it
is
all
right
but
marjorie
is
going
to
have
a
graduation
party
and
they
going
to
have
cocoanut
cake
but
anyway
i
do
care
so
much
about
that
but
oh
boy
cocoanut
cake
is
my
middle
name
he
said
kind
of
slow
sort
of
as
if
he
was
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
well
roy
i
have
an
idea
i
let
you
take
little
mccord
home
i
do
know
what
else
to
do
with
him
i
afraid
he
too
much
for
me
you
see
there
are
a
good
many
boys
who
have
to
be
considered
this
is
much
of
a
place
for
a
campaign
of
reformation
that
just
what
he
said
i
said
are
you
mad
at
skinny
he
said
i
not
mad
roy
but
i
disheartened
a
little
hopeless
i
afraid
i
willing
to
believe
that
he
is
just
right
in
his
head
but
you
see
i
ca
help
him
i
not
a
doctor
his
heroism
is
just
a
phase
of
his
condition
he
gets
excited
that
just
exactly
what
ellsworth
said
because
i
remember
then
he
just
lifted
the
money
and
dropped
it
again
it
was
all
crunched
up
and
damp
sort
of
even
where
i
stood
near
him
i
could
smell
how
it
was
damp
you
know
kind
of
mildewed
alfred
went
down
to
the
and
hid
this
in
the
locker
ellsworth
said
the
key
he
had
fitted
the
padlock
and
he
must
have
known
that
it
the
right
sum
as
nearly
as
our
friend
across
the
lake
remembered
what
he
had
a
little
over
two
hundred
dollars
seven
dollars
over
it
a
miserable
piece
of
business
roy
i
been
lying
awake
thinking
it
over
all
night
and
i
guess
the
best
thing
is
to
send
the
poor
little
wretch
home
i
send
a
letter
to
benton
about
him
he
get
him
into
some
institution
maybe
we
can
help
him
later
he
a
little
young
for
us
then
he
began
whistling
to
himself
and
drumming
on
the
table
gee
i
just
stood
there
watching
him
and
i
did
know
what
to
say
i
wondered
what
bert
winton
would
say
if
he
were
there
in
my
place
pretty
soon
i
said
maybe
i
wo
go
home
to
my
sister
birthday
after
all
gee
i
do
care
so
much
about
cocoanut
cake
anyway
he
just
did
say
anything
only
kept
drumming
and
whistling
then
i
said
did
you
say
anything
to
connie
and
the
elks
no
he
said
but
i
shall
they
have
to
know
why
i
take
him
out
of
their
patrol
they
have
to
know
what
he
did
for
a
couple
of
minutes
i
could
say
anything
at
all
and
i
just
stood
there
gulping
one
thing
no
fellow
can
stand
up
and
say
that
i
ever
talked
back
to
ellsworth
no
siree
no
fellow
can
say
that
but
i
just
happened
to
think
of
something
i
wanted
to
say
and
so
as
soon
as
i
could
get
started
i
said
it
right
out
this
is
what
i
said
ellsworth
you
always
said
a
scout
ought
to
stand
up
for
a
fellow
through
thick
and
thin
no
matter
what
because
we
all
brothers
and
that
what
bert
winton
thinks
too
you
know
it
says
in
the
handbook
how
we
all
brothers
so
skinny
is
my
brother
and
i
should
worry
about
my
sister
racket
i
got
a
week
extra
time
due
me
at
the
camp
on
account
of
twelve
snapshots
last
season
footnote
it
was
the
rule
at
temple
camp
that
any
scout
obtaining
twelve
good
snapshots
of
birds
should
have
a
week
at
camp
in
addition
to
his
regular
time
and
this
he
could
transfer
to
another
scout
as
a
good
editor
so
i
decided
i
give
that
to
skinny
i
suppose
that
if
the
trustees
say
he
a
thief
they
can
send
him
away
no
matter
what
but
the
trustees
do
have
any
meeting
till
next
wednesday
maybe
you
be
willing
to
tell
me
how
i
can
go
and
register
skinny
for
that
week
of
mine
because
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
if
they
want
to
say
he
a
thief
let
them
go
ahead
and
do
it
but
anyway
i
should
worry
they
ca
do
it
before
next
wednesday
and
his
week
will
be
up
then
and
that
will
give
me
a
chance
to
prove
he
did
do
it
ellsworth
smiled
kind
of
and
shook
his
head
then
he
just
sat
looking
at
me
he
said
roy
you
ought
to
make
a
good
lawyer
when
you
grow
up
you
have
put
one
over
on
your
scoutmaster
i
guess
he
mad
anyway
he
said
awful
nice
like
go
over
to
the
administration
rooms
in
the
pavilion
and
see
the
record
clerk
i
wo
interfere
my
boy
gee
i
was
afraid
i
had
made
him
sore
kind
of
but
when
i
was
going
out
i
could
see
that
he
was
just
sitting
there
smiling
at
me
anyway
i
bet
you
have
done
the
same
thing
if
you
been
me
chapter
xxiv
tells
about
how
i
told
a
secret
i
do
know
how
it
got
out
but
inside
of
an
hour
every
fellow
in
that
camp
knew
i
bet
ellsworth
never
said
anything
maybe
somebody
went
with
him
to
the
or
maybe
somebody
followed
him
hey
but
that
always
the
way
it
is
at
temple
camp
things
get
out
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
go
straight
to
see
bert
winton
i
said
i
got
something
to
tell
you
can
you
come
out
alone
because
honest
that
fellow
was
so
popular
he
could
never
get
away
from
his
troop
he
said
come
on
out
on
the
lake
for
a
row
so
we
went
down
to
the
landing
and
on
the
way
a
couple
of
fellows
asked
us
if
we
heard
about
little
skinny
anyway
we
did
pay
any
attention
to
them
one
fellow
who
belonged
in
a
troop
from
boston
said
i
hear
his
patrol
is
going
to
bother
with
him
any
more
i
said
to
bert
that
what
i
called
him
now
i
said
if
that
was
true
about
the
money
he
would
get
the
gold
cross
would
he
he
said
nope
i
guess
not
bravery
does
count
for
much
if
a
fellow
is
crooked
a
highwayman
is
brave
if
it
comes
to
that
by
that
i
knew
that
there
a
lot
to
being
a
hero
besides
just
being
brave
crinkums
i
learned
a
lot
of
things
from
that
fellow
but
as
long
as
he
did
do
it
we
should
worry
i
told
him
that
us
he
said
when
we
got
in
the
boat
he
took
the
oars
and
i
sat
in
the
stern
and
we
just
flopped
around
there
are
many
fellows
out
rowing
mornings
because
they
either
tracking
or
stalking
or
cleaning
up
or
maybe
in
for
a
dip
we
could
see
the
fellows
busy
about
the
cabins
and
hear
them
shouting
and
it
made
me
feel
awful
sorry
for
skinny
somehow
i
see
him
anywheres
and
i
wondered
where
he
was
well
kid
bert
said
most
always
he
called
me
that
things
get
worser
and
worser
hey
do
you
still
say
he
did
do
it
i
asked
him
i
do
know
to
think
look
at
that
money
ever
take
a
good
look
at
skinny
he
said
yes
but
look
at
the
money
i
said
what
do
i
want
to
look
at
it
for
he
said
it
ought
to
be
hung
out
on
the
clothesline
from
all
i
heard
he
said
oh
boy
i
was
glad
to
hear
him
say
that
i
would
let
any
fellow
in
this
camp
except
you
call
me
that
what
i
told
him
he
just
rowed
around
a
little
while
making
dandy
feather
strokes
and
then
he
said
ellsworth
did
send
that
money
over
to
daniel
boone
and
buffalo
bill
yet
did
he
i
said
you
mean
the
gold
dust
twins
no
i
do
think
he
did
he
said
well
then
we
got
to
fix
and
we
ca
ask
not
to
do
it
the
tide
against
us
kid
nobody
going
to
listen
to
us
not
yet
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
sat
up
got
his
oars
set
right
and
oh
bibbie
you
should
have
seen
that
fellow
row
every
stroke
he
took
he
almost
lay
down
flat
and
oh
christmas
could
he
feather
pretty
soon
we
were
over
near
the
shore
where
the
campers
were
you
could
see
their
tent
in
among
the
trees
you
not
going
to
tell
are
you
i
said
but
he
did
answer
me
only
just
called
out
hey
there
you
wild
indians
one
of
them
came
through
the
woods
and
stopped
and
looked
at
us

you
fellows
going
to
the
boat
races
down
at
catskill
winton
shouted
you
going
to
miss
the
time
of
your
lives
if
you
do
better
get
a
hustle
what
time
are
they
the
camper
shouted
just
about
now
bert
shouted
follow
the
old
bowl
creek
bed
and
you
get
there
quicker
then
he
rowed
away
again
that
fix
for
he
said
more
than
one
way
to
kill
a
cat
hey
there
some
races
are
there
i
asked
him
sure
there
are
that
pair
wo
get
back
till
midnight
if
they
once
hit
catskill
i
said
you
think
of
everything
do
you
now
blakeley
he
said
kind
of
more
serious
like
while
he
rowed
around
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
skinny
did
take
the
money
that
settled
all
right
then
who
did
nobody
correct
be
seated
all
right
then
what
became
of
it
david
jones
has
it
our
old
college
chum
davy
it
at
the
bottom
of
black
lake
how
do
i
know
all
this
because
i
know
young
mackinaw
jacket
and
because
i
know
skinny
see
simple
as
eating
pie
gee
i
got
to
admit
that
eating
pie
is
easy
especially
mince
i
told
him
he
said
all
right
now
i
going
to
ask
you
a
question
and
if
you
want
to
you
can
say
of
your
business
you
told
me
you
were
keeping
still
about
something
has
it
anything
to
do
with
skinny
no
siree
it
has
not
i
told
him
all
right
has
it
anything
to
do
with
the
key
he
shot
it
out
just
like
that
and
oh
boy
was
i
up
in
the
air
i
said
maybe
kind
of
yes

has
well
then
you
better
tell
me
all
about
it
he
said
i
ca
i
told
him
he
said
oh
yes
you
can
i
promised
i
would
i
said
well
then
he
said
we
all
up
in
the
air
and
i
guess
i
ca
help
you
much
i
just
thought
that
maybe
two
heads
would
be
better
than
one
that
all
the
money
came
out
of
the
locker
that
sure
any
idea
who
it
belongs
to
for
a
minute
i
just
sat
there
thinking
watching
him
dip
his
oars
he
lifted
them
up
and
i
could
hear
the
water
drip
from
them
and
then
it
would
be
all
quiet
till
he
did
it
again
i
could
row
ashore
with
one
oar
he
said
i
just
have
to
scull
two
oars
are
better
than
one
same
with
heads
blakeley
skinny
got
till
wednesday
you
done
a
good
job
so
far
i
dare
say
the
cross
will
be
here
by
wednesday
ever
try
to
row
blakeley
gee
i
just
could
help
what
i
did
i
just
could
resist
that
fellow
i
said
bert
you
got
more
brains
than
i
have
that
one
sure
thing
and
i
ca
help
doing
just
what
you
say
i
have
to
admit
you
a
wonder
i
ca
do
any
more
alone
i
ca
we
have
to
be
partners
kind
of
do
you
believe
that
about
the
elks
throwing
him
down
bert
there
was
a
fellow
a
big
fellow
and
he
a
son
of
the
man
that
owns
this
boat
and
he
a
lieutenant
this
is
just
what
i
told
him
i
said
he
had
a
whole
lot
of
dandy
adventures
and
he
took
his
uniform
off
to
go
fishing
and
hid
it
in
the
and
then
when
he
came
to
get
it
the
boat
was
gone
because
his
father
told
our
troop
that
we
could
use
it
and
after
we
got
way
down
as
far
as
staten
island
he
sneaked
on
board
one
night
and
put
his
old
clothes
in
the
locker
and
took
his
uniform
and
afterwards
he
dropped
the
key
when
he
tried
to
give
me
some
money
and
skinny
found
it
he
found
the
money
too
and
he
gave
it
to
ellsworth
but
he
forgot
about
the
key
he
gave
it
to
ellsworth
huh
bert
said
yes
he
did
i
told
him
and
that
why
i
going
to
stick
to
him
through
thick
and
thin
i
am
i
do
care
what
so
now
i
told
and
i
have
to
be
to
blame
i
be
to
blame
bert
said
but
anyway
it
on
account
of
skinny
i
said
and
a
fellow
know
what
to
do
all
alone
and
i
like
you
gee
i
like
you
a
lot
i
said
it
right
out
to
him
just
like
that
he
looked
at
me
steady
but
did
say
a
word
and
then
i
could
feel
my
eyes
all
glistening
and
everything
looked
funny
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
did
know
what
i
was
saying
at
all
you
have
to
help
me
i
said
because
you
a
regular
scout
i
can
see
that
and
you
bet
i
like
to
be
just
like
you
if
i
only
could
i
would
you
can
bet
that
fellow
had
lots
of
adventures
and
he
called
me
and
kind
of
laughed
at
me
and
kidded
me
along
but
anyway
maybe
he
all
right
hey
i
guess
it
his
money
but
anyway
you
got
to
help
me
you
have
that
one
sure
thing
because
skinny
more
important
maybe
think
that
a
little
fellow
like
skinny
is
important
and
that
the
trouble
hey
because
he
kind
of
punched
me
in
the
chest
and
laughed
and
said
i
was
a
good
little
sport
he
said
fellows
by
the
name
of
roy
are
all
right
all
the
while
bert
winton
just
sat
there
holding
his
oars
out
of
the
water
and
watching
me
steady
like
a
fellow
watching
a
bird
that
been
stalking
then
he
just
said
well
i
guess
the
big
fellow
was
right
chapter
xxv
tells
about
the
letter
we
wrote
anyway
i
do
care
maybe
you
think
i
was
wrong
but
i
do
care
i
just
had
to
tell
that
fellow
there
was
something
about
that
fellow
i
just
ca
tell
you
what
it
was
so
then
we
fixed
everything
all
up
while
we
were
rowing
around
what
did
i
care
about
going
tracking
or
stalking
with
my
patrol
i
should
worry
they
could
get
along
one
day
without
me
all
right
we
decided
we
write
two
letters
to
lieutenant
donnelle
and
send
one
to
his
house
and
the
other
to
camp
dix
in
wrightstown
we
decided
we
write
them
that
very
day
and
hike
into
catskill
to
mail
them
so
he
be
sure
to
get
one
wherever
he
was
in
time
for
us
to
get
an
answer
before
next
wednesday
ellsworth
went
to
albany
that
day
because
he
had
some
business
to
attend
to
but
i
knew
he
would
do
anything
more
about
skinny
till
he
got
back
and
that
was
one
good
thing
this
was
the
letter
that
we
decided
to
send
because
i
kept
the
first
copy
we
made
we
wrote
it
as
if
it
came
from
me
but
bert
winton
helped
me
dear
lieutenant
donnelle
i
hope
you
got
back
to
camp
all
right
and
that
uncle
sam
did
get
mad
about
it
i
hope
you
there
now
so
you
surely
get
this
anyway
i
hope
you
admit
that
two
heads
are
better
than
one
because
i
had
to
tell
a
fellow
about
you
that
was
because
i
guess
he
the
only
one
here
who
would
help
me
there
a
little
fellow
named
skinny
mccord
here
and
he
came
from
bridgeboro
with
us
his
name
is
really
skinny
but
they
call
him
that
because
he
that
way
and
one
thing
you
be
sorry
for
him
if
you
saw
him
he
talks
kind
of
crazy
sometimes
but
that
because
he
lived
in
a
tenement
house
and
did
have
enough
to
eat
you
know
bad
when
you
do
have
enough
to
eat
he
swam
out
and
saved
a
fellow
life
and
then
there
was
a
lot
of
money
missing
out
of
the
fellow
pocket
and
the
fellows
here
think
skinny
stole
it
the
reason
they
think
that
is
because
he
found
the
key
to
your
locker
and
he
went
to
the
after
that
our
scoutmaster
went
there
with
the
key
and
found
about
two
hundred
dollars
in
your
locker
i
do
know
whether
it
was
in
the
old
clothes
you
took
off
or
not
but
anyway
the
fellow
who
a
good
friend
of
mine
says
that
maybe
send
a
letter
right
away
as
quick
as
you
can
and
say
that
that
money
belongs
to
you
so
will
you
please
do
that
i
send
you
a
stamped
envelope
so
you
be
sure
to
do
it
maybe
a
big
fellow
that
has
had
a
lot
of
adventures
like
you
and
nearly
lost
his
life
a
lot
of
times
and
did
other
dandy
things
would
think
it
was
so
much
to
save
a
fellow
from
drowning
but
anyway
there
a
medal
called
the
gold
cross
that
we
have
and
only
a
fellow
can
win
it
that
has
saved
somebody
life
maybe
it
is
as
much
as
the
distinguished
service
cross
or
that
french
cross
either
but
anyway
its
a
big
honor
that
sure
and
we
want
skinny
to
get
it
so
will
you
please
answer
this
letter
right
away
maybe
you
remember
because
you
have
so
many
adventures
but
i
the
fellow
you
met
on
the
so
please
answer
so
we
will
get
it
before
next
wednesday
maybe
you
got
a
lot
of
important
things
to
do
but
if
you
could
just
see
skinny
you
answer
quick
because
anyway
you
were
nice
to
me
and
you
said
i
was
a
bully
little
pal
maybe
you
wo
remember
it
but
you
did
anyway
you
bet
i
do
something
for
you
if
i
ever
get
a
chance
your
friend
roy
blakeley
be
sure
to
send
the
answer
as
soon
as
you
can
we
wrote
the
letter
up
on
sunset
rock
near
the
camp
and
as
soon
as
we
got
it
finished
we
started
off
to
catskill
because
it
would
go
sooner
than
if
we
mailed
it
in
leeds
just
as
we
were
passing
the
pavilion
we
met
connie
bennett
and
hunt
ward
and
vic
norris
connie
said
well
i
suppose
you
know
what
your
little
birthday
present
put
over
on
us
he
called
skinny
a
birthday
present
because
westy
martin
and
i
gave
skinny
to
the
elks
when
we
first
found
him
i
suppose
you
think
we
were
after
that
two
hundred
too
well
you
can
take
your
little
birthday
present
back
it
was
a
lemon
we
got
stung
if
you
got
what
you
deserved
i
said
you
get
more
than
stung
he
said
yes
yes
i
said
y
e
s
yes
i
never
said
you
wanted
the
money
i
know
every
one
of
you
is
square
skinny
too
did
i
ever
say
you
were
not
i
said
you
wanted
the
cross
that
what
i
said
and
so
you
did
and
i
tell
you
now
that
you
going
to
get
it
and
skinny
going
to
bring
it
to
you
chuck
him
out
if
you
want
to
he
should
worry
if
he
is
good
enough
for
you
he
good
enough
do
you
see
that
cabin
up
on
the
hill
do
you
see
this
fellow
that
with
me
he
belongs
to
the
royal
bengal
tigers
if
anybody
should
ask
you
and
skinny
good
enough
for
he
can
sleep
up
there
he
should
worry
they
got
three
extra
cots
they
better
keep
their
watches
near
them
vic
norris
said
take
him
you
welcome
to
him
nobody
ever
said
we
were
crooks
in
our
patrol
nobody
said
you
were
i
shouted
and
bert
winton
just
had
to
hold
me
back
but
you
would
talk
like
that
if
ellsworth
was
here
and
you
know
you
would
do
you
suppose
i
let
anybody
say
you
on
the
square
we
all
in
the
one
troop
but
you
boosted
skinny
you
used
him
and
in
a
crazy
fit
he
went
out
and
blamed
near
gave
his
life
for
you
he
does
know
two
of
the
laws
he
ca
say
the
oath
straight
because
you
had
his
head
filled
with
awards
and
medals
and
things
you
wanted
the
gold
cross
and
now
by
christopher
i
going
to
see
that
you
get
it
you
have
nothing
to
say
about
it
skinny
mccord
is
going
to
bring
you
the
gold
cross
just
as
you
wanted
and
going
to
shout
and
cheer
till
you
ca
speak
who
make
us
connie
said
i
told
him
chapter
xxvi
tells
about
geography
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff
first
we
tried
to
find
skinny
to
take
him
with
us
but
he
anywhere
around
somebody
told
us
they
thought
he
was
off
somewhere
with
uncle
jeb
i
guess
maybe
uncle
jeb
did
know
anything
about
all
the
talk
because
that
was
often
the
way
it
was
with
him
and
even
if
he
did
know
maybe
he
took
skinny
anyway
one
thing
sure
i
hoped
it
was
true
because
whenever
a
fellow
goes
off
with
uncle
jeb
he
tells
him
all
about
the
trees
and
things
like
that
trees
can
be
friends
to
you
and
they
never
go
back
on
you
that
one
thing
i
said
he
be
all
right
as
long
as
he
with
uncle
jeb
bert
said
yes
but
we
have
to
get
back
before
he
be
wandering
around
alone
i
take
him
up
to
our
cabin
guess
he
be
all
right
till
we
get
back
temple
camp
can
be
a
mighty
lonely
place
sometimes
blakeley
just
the
same
all
the
way
over
to
the
hudson
i
kept
thinking
about
skinny
and
hoping
he
was
hiding
away
from
the
fellows
or
off
all
alone
somewhere
i
knew
they
would
bother
with
him
especially
now
and
i
kept
thinking
that
maybe
he
go
away
by
himself
and
get
into
some
harm
i
kept
thinking
about
how
he
said
i
want
to
be
alone
by
myself
and
he
feel
that
way
even
more
now
on
account
of
the
disgrace
i
said
poor
little
skinny
i
wish
we
had
him
along
he
with
uncle
jeb
most
likely
bert
said
wonder
what
the
old
man
thinks
about
it
ever
look
into
those
gray
eyes
of
his
you
never
catch
uncle
jeb
saying
anything
till
he
sure
i
said
and
even
then
it
takes
him
a
couple
of
minutes
to
get
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
he
says
when
you
aim
always
aim
as
if
you
had
only
one
bullet
and
it
was
the
last
one
in
the
world
that
him
all
right
bert
said
well
there
no
good
worrying
i
told
him
we
just
get
back
as
soon
as
we
can
what
do
you
say
we
row
across
and
cut
through
nick
valley
bert
asked
it
shorter
i
game
i
said
the
quicker
the
sooner
we
can
follow
the
old
creek
bed
he
said
know
where
that
is
you
i
said
believe
me
the
only
bed
i
know
anything
about
is
the
one
i
sleep
in
i
do
see
how
you
find
out
so
many
things
especially
as
you
were
never
here
before
oh
i
like
to
just
prowl
around
he
said
that
the
way
with
tigers
i
notice
you
always
have
a
stick
too
i
said
he
said
sure
a
stick
good
company
i
just
root
around
with
it
this
is
my
third
season
here
i
said
and
i
never
even
heard
about
any
old
creek
bed
i
never
heard
about
nick
valley
either
guess
you
never
talked
much
with
the
old
farmers
hey
he
asked
we
rowed
across
the
lake
to
nick
cove
i
knew
all
about
that
because
it
was
where
the
campers
were
and
besides
i
knew
about
it
anyway
if
you
will
look
on
the
map
you
see
it
and
you
notice
how
there
are
mountains
there
kind
of
two
sets
of
mountains
with
a
space
between
i
made
that
map
so
you
could
see
just
how
everything
happened
because
believe
me
we
were
going
to
have
adventure
only
we
did
know
it
we
rowed
way
up
into
the
end
of
nick
cove
and
pulled
the
skiff
part
way
up
on
shore
one
thing
i
noticed
and
that
was
that
some
of
the
trees
around
there
stood
in
the
water
i
knew
that
was
on
account
of
the
lake
being
swollen
because
there
had
been
so
much
rain
lately
even
over
at
temple
camp
the
water
was
up
to
the
so
that
when
we
jumped
on
it
it
splashed
right
into
the
lake
cove
is
pretty
big
after
all
the
rain
bert
said
and
then
sure
enough
he
looked
around
and
broke
a
branch
off
a
tree
and
pulled
the
twigs
off
it
that
do
to
poke
around
with
he
said
now
come
ahead
you
and
your
stick
are
like
uncle
jeb
and
his
pipe
i
told
him
he
said
now
we
wend
our
way
through
old
nick
valley
it
bring
us
right
out
near
the
old
creek
bed
then
we
can
follow
that
right
down
to
the
river
that
the
way
skinny
did
but
i
guess
he
just
stumbled
through
that
way
ever
hear
of
old
nick
only
on
account
of
the
name
nick
cove
i
said
is
he
dead
oh
very
much
dead
he
said
he
died
about
a
hundred
years
ago
did
you
know
he
was
dead
believe
i
never
even
knew
he
was
sick
i
told
him
then
he
said
well
from
all
i
can
learn
old
nick
owned
all
the
land
for
miles
around
here
and
he
lived
at
the
bottom
of
black
lake
good
night
i
said
if
i
owned
as
much
land
as
that
i
would
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
lake
kind
of
damp
huh
he
asked
but
you
see
black
lake
was
here
then
where
was
it
i
asked
him
well
it
just
was
he
said
it
was
dry
land
the
way
i
make
it
out
it
was
bowl
valley
and
old
nick
lived
right
down
in
the
bottom
of
bowl
valley
there
an
old
woman
on
the
berry
creek
road
who
smokes
a
clay
pipe
she
about
a
hundred
years
old
she
told
me
all
about
it
people
around
here
ca
even
tell
you
where
bowl
valley
was
they
do
know
what
you
talking
about
when
you
mention
such
a
place
i
dug
up
a
whole
lot
of
stuff
about
it
old
nick
got
descendants
living
around
here
now
and
they
do
even
know
about
it
but
you
found
out
i
said
that
because
i
an
old
tramp
he
said
laughing
sort
of
i
like
to
sit
up
on
barnyard
fences
and
chin
with
old
wives
whenever
i
can
manage
to
get
away
from
my
patrol
gee
i
do
blame
them
for
not
letting
you
get
away
from
them
i
said
all
the
while
we
were
hiking
it
along
between
the
mountains
and
it
was
pretty
wet
in
some
places
because
it
was
a
low
valley
we
were
in
now
this
is
nick
valley
bert
said
it
all
full
of
puddles
hey
look
out
for
your
feet
this
will
bring
us
out
at
the
old
creek
bed
and
we
can
follow
that
down
to
the
hudson
look
at
that
fish
will
you
a
killie
huh
washed
away
in
here
some
rains
he
poked
a
little
killie
out
from
under
some
grass
with
his
stick
honest
that
fellow
never
missed
anything
sometimes
i
root
out
the
funniest
kinds
of
insects
you
ever
saw
with
a
stick
he
said
it
a
kind
of
a
magic
wand
ever
talk
with
a
civil
engineer
believe
me
i
said
the
only
civil
engineer
i
ever
talked
with
did
most
of
the
talking
he
would
let
us
play
ball
in
his
lot
he
was
an
uncivil
engineer
that
what
was
bert
said
well
there
was
a
civil
engineer
here
with
a
troop
from
out
west
somewhere
he
was
a
scoutmaster
he
took
me
on
a
couple
of
good
hikes
we
found
some
turtle
shells
over
through
there
a
little
farther
along
and
when
he
took
a
squint
at
the
land
he
saw
how
a
little
valley
all
grown
up
with
weeds
and
brush
ran
along
east
and
west
he
said
that
was
where
the
creek
once
flowed
and
it
did
come
within
a
mile
of
the
lake
savvy
the
place
where
the
lake
is
now
used
to
be
bowl
valley
when
the
creek
changed
its
bed
and
cut
through
a
couple
of
miles
south
it
just
filled
up
bowl
valley
and
there
you
are
black
lake
presto
chango
funny
how
old
dame
nature
changes
her
mind
now
and
then
that
just
the
way
it
is
with
girls
i
said
bert
said
well
and
that
scoutmaster
said
she
be
changing
her
mind
again
some
day
too
he
said
the
topography
around
here
is
pretty
shaky
whatever
that
means
oh
boy
i
said
break
it
to
me
gently
do
you
mean
that
some
fine
day
we
wake
up
and
find
black
lake
has
sneaked
off
that
just
about
it
he
said
do
you
call
that
fair
and
square
i
asked
after
temple
bought
the
lake
and
gave
it
to
temple
camp
believe
me
it
to
be
called
black
lake
it
is
very
white
that
one
sure
thing
that
may
not
happen
for
a
thousand
years
bert
said
chapter
xxvii
tells
about
how
we
tried
to
stop
it
raining
jumping
jiminy
that
was
a
new
one
on
lakes
moving
around
like
people
that
live
in
flats
and
where
would
temple
camp
be
i
like
to
know
and
just
after
we
paid
four
dollars
and
eighteen
cents
to
put
up
a
springboard
if
you
would
mind
i
said
i
like
to
know
how
that
could
happen
because
if
it
going
away
i
going
to
stalk
it
do
you
know
what
erosion
is
he
said
not
guilty
i
told
him
well
he
said
it
earth
being
eaten
away
kind
of
by
who
i
asked
he
must
have
some
appetite
by
the
water
he
said
that
what
causes
changes
in
topography
all
right
i
said
i
take
your
word
for
it
but
will
the
lake
be
there
when
we
get
back
because
i
got
some
eel
lines
out
he
said
oh
yes
it
wo
move
till
may
first
thank
goodness
for
that
i
told
him
i
guess
maybe
you
better
look
at
the
map
now
hey
it
is
much
of
a
map
but
you
should
worry
if
you
do
take
a
good
look
at
it
pretty
soon
you
wo
know
where
you
at
i
guess
you
can
squint
out
the
valley
between
the
mountains
that
nick
valley
everything
around
there
belonged
to
old
nick
if
he
did
own
the
moon
it
was
because
he
could
reach
it
now
that
just
where
we
went
through
see
and
it
was
all
full
of
puddles
young
lakes
i
could
draw
them
with
a
pencil
but
they
were
there
i
can
prove
it
because
i
got
my
feet
wet
pretty
soon
bert
said
here
where
you
ought
to
have
your
scout
staff
with
you
and
just
then
i
stumbled
down
among
a
lot
of
brush
now
you
in
it
he
said
in
what
i
asked
him
in
the
bed
he
said
you
call
this
a
bed
i
asked
him
i
like
a
brass
bed
better
if
you
only
had
your
staff
you
could
have
felt
ahead
i
can
feel
a
head
now
i
told
him
and
it
got
a
good
bump
on
it
well
he
said
you
right
in
the
hollow
where
the
old
creek
used
to
flow
let
push
along
through
it
a
little
ways
and
see
what
we
can
dig
up
you
could
see
that
it
was
a
hollow
just
looking
at
it
but
you
had
to
go
down
into
it
and
then
you
knew
it
was
all
grown
up
with
bushes
and
we
just
went
along
through
it
the
same
as
if
we
were
pushing
through
a
jungle
all
of
a
sudden
i
felt
something
crunch
under
my
foot
and
when
i
picked
it
up
i
saw
it
was
a
fish
backbone
see
bert
said
what
did
i
tell
you
it
seemed
funny
to
be
squirming
our
way
along
where
a
creek
used
to
flow
before
it
changed
its
mind
and
decided
to
flow
into
bowl
valley
maybe
it
changed
its
mind
and
made
the
lake
because
it
knew
the
scouts
were
coming
hey
i
asked
that
was
a
good
turn
it
was
a
good
turn
he
said
and
nobody
around
here
seems
to
know
anything
about
this
old
creek
bottom
we
just
stumbled
into
it
the
same
as
you
did
that
some
bump
you
got
sure
my
topography
is
changed
i
told
him
he
said
old
nick
fought
in
the
revolutionary
war
he
owned
all
this
land
around
here
right
through
to
the
lake
i
mean
bowl
valley
his
house
was
at
the
bottom
of
bowl
valley
what
do
you
say
we
fish
it
up
some
day
i
asked
him
all
this
was
his
farm
bert
said
see
that
old
silo
there
i
guess
that
what
it
was
or
something
like
it
maybe
he
hid
muskets
or
powder
from
the
redcoats
there
hey
i
said
now
if
you
look
at
the
map
you
see
just
where
we
were
i
was
right
on
the
edge
of
that
ring
i
made
do
you
see
the
ring
well
that
ring
was
really
a
round
hole
in
the
ground
just
beside
the
old
creek
bottom
gee
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
that
hole
because
you
make
a
hole
on
a
map
it
was
about
fifty
feet
deep
and
about
thirty
feet
wide
i
guess
and
it
was
all
walled
in
with
masonry
it
looked
like
a
great
well
bert
thought
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
farm
that
used
to
be
there
because
quite
near
it
there
was
an
old
foundation
maybe
it
was
some
kind
of
a
silo
i
do
know
i
said
i
like
to
get
down
in
that
what
for
bert
said
there
nothing
but
puddles
at
the
bottom
how
would
you
ever
get
out
could
we
drop
one
of
those
saplings
into
it
and
i
could
shin
up
that
i
said
because
i
saw
two
or
three
saplings
lying
around
i
suppose
they
blew
down
in
the
storms
lately
what
would
be
the
use
he
asked
you
can
see
what
down
there
if
we
going
to
get
those
letters
onto
a
mail
train
we
got
to
hustle
that
was
enough
for
me
because
i
cared
more
about
skinny
than
i
did
about
all
the
old
creek
bottoms
and
holes
in
the
ground
this
side
of
jericho
so
i
just
said
righto
and
we
started
following
the
old
creek
bed
till
pretty
soon
the
bushes
were
so
thick
that
we
hit
up
north
of
it
a
little
ways
and
hiked
straight
over
to
the
houseboat
when
we
got
to
the
we
lowered
the
skiff
and
rowed
across
to
catskill
and
mailed
the
letters
then
we
went
up
the
street
for
a
couple
of
sodas
bert
bought
some
peanut
brittle
too
i
crazy
about
that
then
we
went
to
another
store
and
got
some
post
cards
some
of
them
had
pictures
of
temple
camp
on
them
i
sent
home
about
six
all
the
while
it
was
getting
dark
and
pretty
soon
it
began
to
rain
so
i
said
let
go
and
get
a
couple
more
sodas
till
it
holds
up
we
drank
two
sodas
each
but
even
still
it
did
hold
up
we
ca
make
it
hold
up
that
way
bert
said
i
do
believe
twenty
sodas
would
do
it
the
way
it
raining
now
i
guess
you
right
i
said
but
anyway
i
willing
to
try
twenty
if
you
say
so
no
fellow
could
ever
say
was
a
quitter
chapter
xxviii
tells
about
how
dame
nature
changed
her
mind
maybe
you
laugh
at
that
stopping
a
shower
with
sodas
but
once
on
my
way
home
from
school
i
stopped
in
vander
drug
store
to
get
a
soda
and
wait
for
the
rain
to
stop
when
i
was
finished
it
had
stopped
so
i
got
another
soda
a
strawberry
even
after
that
the
rain
stop
and
i
was
just
going
to
start
out
anyway
when
a
man
who
was
in
there
said
why
do
you
try
one
more
so
i
did
a
pineapple
and
by
the
time
i
had
finished
that
the
rain
had
stopped
so
that
proves
it
but
that
day
i
telling
you
about
i
guess
it
would
have
stopped
even
if
we
had
stayed
in
catskill
a
couple
of
hours
drinking
sodas
we
sat
on
one
of
the
benches
in
the
waiting
room
of
the
wharf
where
the
albany
boats
stop
and
watched
it
rain
it
was
so
thick
that
we
could
hardly
see
across
the
river
merry
christmas
did
it
come
down
we
saw
the
big
day
boat
go
up
and
all
her
lights
were
burning
it
was
so
dark
on
the
river
i
guess
we
waited
a
couple
of
hours
it
all
on
account
of
the
old
swithin
i
said
i
bet
he
was
the
head
of
an
umbrella
trust
bert
said
oh
i
do
know
i
kind
of
like
rain
it
all
part
of
the
scout
game
that
was
just
like
him
he
had
some
use
for
everything
i
guess
it
must
have
been
about
supper
time
when
it
held
up
enough
for
us
to
start
across
anyway
i
know
i
was
hungry
but
that
was
no
proof
it
was
supper
time
sometimes
i
been
hungry
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
guess
swithin
stopped
to
have
his
supper
anyway
it
began
pouring
again
as
soon
as
we
got
across
anyway
we
got
the
letters
mailed
i
said
what
do
i
care
let
it
rain
i
willing
bert
said
as
long
as
we
ca
stop
it
we
were
both
feeling
good
even
if
we
were
wet
suppose
lieutenant
donnelle
writes
and
says
he
does
know
anything
about
the
money
i
said
because
now
the
excitement
of
getting
the
letters
ready
and
all
that
was
over
i
began
to
feel
a
little
shaky
bert
said
well
if
it
a
case
of
suppose
we
start
home
we
hiked
it
back
the
same
way
we
had
come
all
the
way
in
a
pelting
rain
it
came
down
in
sheets
and
pillowcases
when
we
hit
into
the
old
creek
bed
the
water
was
running
through
it
just
the
same
as
if
it
was
a
regular
creek
it
was
right
up
to
the
top
of
the
bushes
that
grew
there
and
dragging
them
sideways
as
it
rushed
along
well
what
do
you
know
about
that
i
said
bert
just
stood
looking
at
it
and
then
he
said
that
no
rain
water
sure
it
is
i
said
what
else
do
you
suppose
it
is
wrong
he
said
all
of
a
sudden
he
reached
in
through
the
wet
bushes
and
pulled
something
out
look
at
that
he
said
it
was
a
sort
of
a
little
college
pennant
on
a
stick
those
fellows
went
to
catskill
did
they
bert
asked
me
kind
of
quick
i
told
him
yes
i
thought
so
lucky
for
them
he
said
that
off
their
tent
come
on
hurry
up
we
did
try
to
go
through
the
old
creek
bottom
but
even
alongside
it
we
began
coming
to
big
puddles
and
pretty
soon
we
were
wading
through
water
up
to
our
waists
even
a
hundred
feet
away
from
it
the
land
was
like
a
lake
and
we
just
plodded
and
stumbled
through
water
i
knew
now
that
the
rain
itself
could
never
have
done
that
pretty
soon
we
must
have
got
over
into
the
old
creek
bed
because
we
stumbled
and
went
kerflop
in
and
the
next
thing
we
knew
we
were
swimming
let
get
out
of
this
but
try
to
keep
near
it
bert
said
so
know
where
we
going
this
has
got
me
rattled
i
do
know
happened
or
where
we
at
i
do
even
know
if
we
north
or
south
of
the
creek
bed
it
was
pretty
hard
keeping
near
the
hollow
because
all
the
land
was
flooded
and
we
had
to
feel
each
step
but
if
we
got
away
from
it
night
we
did
know
where
we
might
end
only
the
trouble
was
it
kept
getting
worse
and
worse
the
farther
we
went
and
it
nearly
toppled
us
over
backwards
it
was
flowing
so
strong
pretty
soon
bert
stopped
and
said
listen
we
were
both
standing
in
the
water
up
to
our
waists
and
i
was
shivering
it
was
so
cold
do
you
hear
the
sound
of
water
rushing
he
asked
me
i
listened
and
heard
a
sound
far
off
like
a
water
fall
what
is
it
i
asked
search
bert
answered
but
we
in
bad
here
let
head
for
the
mountains
now
i
did
know
what
had
happened
except
that
the
whole
country
was
under
water
when
it
comes
to
the
lay
of
the
land
i
can
usually
tell
where
i
at
but
when
it
comes
to
the
lay
of
the
water
and
believe
me
there
nothing
that
changes
the
looks
of
things
like
water
i
think
those
are
the
mountains
that
make
nick
valley
i
said
let
try
to
get
over
that
way
there
a
waterfall
coming
down
out
of
a
crevice
between
them
bert
said
i
know
what
happened
the
valley
is
flooded
you
see
we
were
in
the
low
fields
west
of
those
mountains
i
ca
tell
you
just
where
but
somewhere
there
were
hollows
in
the
fields
so
sometimes
we
were
walking
and
sometimes
we
were
swimming
it
was
the
outside
of
the
mountains
that
we
saw
as
you
might
say
i
mean
the
side
away
from
the
valley
so
the
water
coming
out
through
a
cleft
proved
that
the
water
must
be
pretty
high
inside
i
mean
in
nick
valley
i
guess
you
see
what
i
mean
if
you
look
at
the
map
but
believe
me
it
was
easy
to
get
to
those
mountains
seeing
them
was
one
thing
and
getting
to
them
was
another
we
just
plodded
around
stumbling
off
little
hills
that
were
under
water
and
we
did
seem
to
get
anywhere
after
a
while
we
came
out
on
higher
land
where
there
was
much
water
except
puddles
some
cruise
hey
i
said
shh
listen
bert
said
you
can
hear
it
plainer
now
look
over
there
now
as
near
as
i
can
tell
you
we
must
have
been
standing
near
the
north
side
of
the
old
creek
bottom
and
we
must
have
been
pretty
close
to
the
old
silo
or
whatever
you
call
it
but
we
did
know
that
then
believe
we
did
know
anything
except
that
we
were
wet
we
were
standing
on
a
little
sort
of
a
hill
and
the
water
was
washing
up
almost
to
our
feet
besides
it
was
getting
dark
but
anyway
this
is
what
we
saw
and
if
you
just
make
believe
that
you
standing
on
a
little
hill
near
that
old
pit
and
looking
south
toward
black
lake
you
see
just
what
we
saw
as
you
might
say
we
saw
the
water
just
pouring
through
nick
valley
and
coming
toward
us
and
going
into
the
old
creek
bed
now
that
the
best
way
i
can
tell
it
to
you
i
guess
the
little
hill
we
were
on
acted
kind
of
like
a
back
stop
maybe
anyway
that
what
bert
said
because
the
water
only
beat
against
it
and
then
went
tumbling
back
into
the
creek
bed
and
down
toward
the
hudson
it
was
down
that
way
that
it
overflowed
mostly
and
flooded
the
fields
we
had
been
plodding
through
one
thing
we
had
a
grandstand
view
i
said
and
believe
me
that
was
true
the
water
just
came
pouring
and
rushing
between
those
mountains
and
sometimes
we
could
see
trees
and
things
we
thought
might
be
parts
of
houses
coming
along
one
big
white
thing
we
saw
and
we
knew
it
was
a
tent
black
lake
was
coming
out
to
meet
us
through
nick
valley
chapter
xxix
tells
about
how
we
looked
into
the
pit
i
never
saw
anything
like
that
before
and
it
it
did
exactly
scare
me
but
it
made
me
feel
sort
of
funny
it
gave
me
the
creeps
to
see
right
in
front
of
me
like
that
how
lakes
and
valleys
and
all
the
land
could
be
changed
and
me
standing
there
watching
it
it
seemed
as
if
the
earth
was
being
made
all
over
again
as
you
might
say
that
where
we
came
through
only
a
little
while
ago
i
said
how
will
it
be
inside
where
the
lake
was
is
especially
it
seemed
queer
like
because
it
was
getting
dark
fast
and
the
sound
of
the
water
rushing
and
the
sky
all
black
made
everything
seem
awful
gloomy
is
temple
camp
all
right
do
you
suppose
i
asked
bert
guess
so
he
said
that
over
on
the
south
shore
but
hanged
if
i
know
how
we
going
to
get
there
or
anywhere
else
guess
we
just
have
to
stand
here
like
the
statue
of
liberty
i
said
listen
to
the
water
it
is
so
high
in
the
valley
bert
said
it
must
have
been
worse
a
couple
of
hours
ago
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
said
shh
listen
i
hear
it
i
said
no
not
the
water
he
said
listen
do
you
hear
a
sound
like
groaning
i
listened
and
as
sure
as
i
was
standing
there
i
heard
a
low
sound
as
if
someone
was
groaning
far
away
that
is
the
water
is
it
bert
asked
sure
it
is
i
told
him
and
it
is
from
up
through
valley
because
look
the
wind
is
blowing
from
us
that
way
i
held
up
my
scout
scarf
to
show
him
how
it
blew
toward
the
valley
and
again
we
heard
the
groans
long
and
low
sort
of
it
somewhere
right
around
here
bert
said
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
said
look
just
in
back
of
us
not
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
feet
off
was
the
pit
i
could
see
it
plain
because
the
stone
work
came
up
a
couple
of
feet
or
so
above
the
ground
right
close
to
it
was
a
canoe
all
smashed
in
i
could
see
now
that
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
earlier
the
water
must
have
poured
through
there
when
it
first
overflowed
the
creek
we
listened
again
and
could
hear
the
groaning
plain
i
do
know
who
it
is
bert
said
but
that
the
gold
dust
canoe
come
on
we
plodded
over
through
the
mud
and
water
to
the
pit
and
looked
over
the
edge
it
was
pretty
dark
down
there
but
i
could
see
that
there
was
only
a
little
water
in
the
bottom
of
it
not
much
more
than
before
that
funny
bert
said
it
must
have
overflowed
in
there
when
it
first
splashed
down
into
the
creek
bed
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
took
out
a
flashlight
and
held
it
down
the
hole
but
it
was
wet
and
would
light
look
down
at
the
bottom
over
at
the
left
side
he
said
do
you
see
something
at
first
it
looked
like
a
bundle
all
covered
with
mud
then
i
saw
something
white
on
it
it
was
a
face
it
did
budge
just
lay
there
and
it
seemed
awful
white
on
account
of
the
bottom
being
almost
dark
it
skinny
bert
said
in
a
kind
of
whisper
i
just
said
yes
i
could
say
anything
more
because
i
was
all
trembling
chapter
xxx
tells
about
how
tigers
leap
of
course
we
did
stop
to
think
about
it
then
but
i
knew
that
when
the
water
first
came
rushing
through
nick
valley
it
must
have
been
dashed
right
into
the
pit
there
was
skinny
body
to
prove
it
afterward
when
it
got
flowing
into
the
creek
bottom
and
spreading
out
over
the
fields
below
i
could
see
how
it
would
flow
into
that
hole
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
if
you
look
at
the
map
that
in
the
first
rush
it
have
done
that
gee
i
no
civil
engineer
but
anyway
i
could
see
that
anyway
we
did
stop
to
think
about
that
or
the
canoe
either
but
only
just
skinny
see
if
the
paddle
anywhere
around
bert
said
his
voice
was
awful
funny
sharp
kind
of
as
if
he
meant
business
what
do
you
want
that
for
i
asked
him
all
excited
look
and
see
do
as
i
tell
you
he
just
said
it
was
in
the
smashed
canoe
and
i
just
stood
there
holding
it
what
i
do
with
it
i
asked
him
just
hold
it
he
said
then
he
said
now
blakeley
there
only
one
way
to
get
down
there
and
that
to
jump
it
pretty
deep
but
the
main
question
is
it
wide
enough
if
it
is
well
i
a
tiger
and
i
ought
to
manage
it
i
did
know
then
but
i
found
out
afterward
that
when
a
tiger
makes
a
leap
out
of
a
tree
he
rolls
over
when
he
hits
ground
and
turns
a
sort
of
summersault
so
as
to
break
the
shock
there
a
certain
way
to
do
it
that
all
i
know
but
i
knew
when
he
said
it
that
the
royal
bengal
tigers
from
ohio
were
like
the
others
away
out
in
india
in
more
ways
than
i
ever
thought
about
i
said
bert
you
ca
do
it
tigers
are
shut
up
he
said
and
listen
even
if
you
did
i
said
no
i
shut
up
listen
even
if
you
did
how
could
you
get
out
have
some
sense
i
followed
you
all
the
time
but
now
you
got
to
listen
i
like
you
better
than
any
fellow
even
westy
and
wait
a
minute
even
skinny
it
too
late
bert
he
said
blakeley
we
have
two
chances
just
two
you
know
the
third
law
i
do
tell
you
what
you
got
to
do
blakeley
that
your
business
but
listen
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
his
voice
was
all
husky
he
said
blakeley
if
i
do
make
it
you
have
my
body
to
ease
the
shock
for
you
people
people
will
be
here
you
get
out
it
getting
we
have
to
think
about
if
i
make
it
try
to
land
on
your
feet
a
little
forward
like
this
see
and
duck
your
head
and
do
a
summersault
forward
see
if
you
do
want
to
it
none
of
my
business
only
i
telling
you
how
here
he
said
and
he
threw
a
lot
of
things
out
of
his
pockets
you
give
them
to
my
patrol
keep
them
i
said
i
get
them
when
i
come
down
if
necessary
it
it
you
and
i
and
skinny
bert
sink
or
swim
live
or
die
it
the
three
of
us
i
ready
chapter
xxxi
tells
about
the
old
passageway
honest
as
sure
as
i
sitting
here
i
would
have
gone
down
first
after
the
way
that
fellow
spoke
to
me
it
just
sent
thrills
through
me
and
only
a
couple
of
days
before
i
did
like
him
and
i
thought
he
did
trust
skinny
i
grabbed
hold
of
him
and
i
said
bert
i
just
a
second
i
have
to
tell
you
if
i
do
see
you
again
i
mean
so
i
can
speak
to
you
i
have
to
tell
you
you
a
hero
but
he
jerked
my
hand
off
his
sleeve
he
did
say
anything
but
just
jerked
my
hand
off
his
sleeve
and
i
stood
there
holding
the
paddle
and
i
could
hear
the
water
rushing
in
the
valley
and
i
was
breathing
hard
and
all
trembling
i
called
bert
are
you
all
right
bert
but
he
did
answer
then
i
went
to
the
edge
and
i
was
all
shaking
from
head
to
foot
but
i
was
ready
it
was
all
dark
down
there
and
i
could
see
anyway
i
was
ready
bert
i
called
and
i
just
waited
i
could
hear
the
water
rushing
through
the
valley
and
sometimes
sounds
like
trees
breaking
and
i
heard
a
moaning
it
seemed
funny
to
hear
that
bert
i
called
i
felt
cold
and
my
wrists
were
all
tingling
bert
then
i
stuck
the
paddle
in
the
mud
and
hung
my
hat
on
the
end
of
it
just
then
i
heard
a
voice
it
sounded
strained
and
not
like
bert
as
if
it
could
speak
on
account
of
pain
do
jump
stay
i
waited
a
few
seconds
and
then
called
if
hurt
i
coming
anyway
do
jump
he
kind
of
groaned
i
all
right
just
a
strain
jump
i
sat
on
the
edge
waiting
i
was
just
counting
the
seconds
i
was
afraid
he
never
speak
again
then
he
said
all
right
kiddo
just
strained
my
wrist
are
you
i
called
down
dip
it
in
the
water
slap
some
mud
on
it
is
he
dead
i
knew
now
that
he
must
be
all
right
because
i
heard
him
move
for
about
half
a
minute
he
did
answer
then
he
called
up
he
alive
but
he
is
conscious
how
about
i
said
alive
and
conscious
he
said
do
worry
then
for
about
a
minute
he
did
speak
do
you
want
the
paddle
i
called
nope
chuck
it
he
said
this
is
a
place
of
mystery
know
where
the
water
went
there
a
passageway
down
here
it
big
enough
to
crawl
through
ouch
tell
me
the
truth
i
said
you
hurt
i
in
a
very
critical
condition
from
a
swollen
wrist
he
said
shut
up
will
you
there
a
secret
passageway
or
something
or
other
down
here
where
do
you
suppose
it
goes
hanged
if
know
i
said
what
about
skinny
he
breathing
that
all
know
he
said
for
a
couple
of
minutes
i
sat
on
the
edge
thinking
and
i
could
hear
him
down
there
i
did
know
what
he
was
doing
then
i
called
you
know
rebel
cave
do
you
above
the
shore
south
of
nick
cove
near
the
outlet
maybe
it
comes
out
there
the
passage
i
mean
what
makes
you
think
so
he
called
i
do
say
i
think
so
i
said
only
there
a
kind
of
a
passageway
that
goes
into
the
hills
there
it
starts
in
the
cave
none
of
us
ever
followed
it
because
it
so
dark
and
wet
a
fellow
found
an
old
musket
stock
there
once
what
do
you
say
he
called
there
no
time
to
lose
that
sure
shall
i
try
it
it
would
take
an
hour
to
flood
this
pesky
old
hole
even
if
i
could
stop
up
the
passage
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
knew
why
he
had
told
me
to
be
ready
with
the
paddle
it
was
so
i
could
open
a
little
trench
through
the
muddy
land
and
start
the
water
flowing
into
the
pit
that
way
he
get
to
the
top
with
skinny
but
you
ca
stop
up
the
passageway
i
said
the
water
flowed
through
it
and
went
out
somewhere
maybe
through
the
cave
and
back
into
the
lake
if
it
big
enough
you
could
do
the
same
both
of
us
stay
where
you
are
he
shouted
and
do
be
a
fool
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
carry
two
fellows
through
there
one
enough
by
heck
going
to
try
it
it
the
only
thing
to
do
suppose
it
should
bring
you
out
anywhere
i
said
suppose
it
should
he
fired
back
at
me
then
he
said
now
blakeley
i
tell
you
what
to
do
i
going
to
start
through
this
place
with
the
kid
he
alive
that
the
most
i
can
tell
you
it
must
come
out
somewhere
and
i
bank
on
its
coming
out
where
you
say
if
it
does
and
do
talk
like
that
bert
i
said
it
to
if
want
it
to
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
he
said
i
want
you
to
beat
it
up
through
the
mountains
that
close
in
nick
valley
that
way
you
get
to
the
lake
do
expect
to
see
nick
cove
because
it
off
the
map
when
you
get
to
the
lake
find
somebody
get
over
to
camp
if
you
can
i
do
care
how
maybe
the
boat
we
left
in
the
cove
is
cast
up
there
you
ca
tell
anyway
keep
your
head
and
do
get
excited
the
lake
is
there
it
be
lower
than
it
was
but
all
the
water
below
the
valley
level
will
be
there
get
some
people
and
take
them
to
rebels
cave
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
just
wait
is
that
all
i
shall
do
i
asked
him
what
else
can
you
do
just
wait
there
or
two
or
three
of
you
might
come
in
with
lanterns
to
meet
me
suppose
you
not
there
i
said
all
trembling
well
if
i
not
there
you
know
i
with
skinny
anyway
and
if
anybody
ever
digs
up
our
bones
they
wo
know
who
who
hurry
up
now
beat
it
and
remember
you
a
scout
but
suppose
you
leave
that
to
me
he
said
chapter
xxxii
tells
about
what
i
discovered
in
rebels
cave
all
righto
so
long
i
heard
him
say
after
a
few
seconds
i
called
are
you
all
right
and
i
heard
him
say
as
if
his
voice
was
muffled
and
far
away
all
right
so
far
i
said
to
myself
poor
little
kid
he
is
very
heavy
that
one
thing
then
i
started
off
it
was
hard
to
swim
across
the
old
creek
bed
because
the
water
was
flowing
easier
now
and
pretty
soon
i
was
hiking
it
up
through
the
mountains
now
the
way
i
went
was
through
those
mountains
west
of
nick
valley
and
i
went
south
toward
the
lake
you
look
at
the
map
and
you
see
just
the
way
i
went
the
woods
are
pretty
thick
up
in
those
mountains
and
a
couple
of
times
i
got
rattled
about
which
way
to
go
but
most
of
the
time
i
could
look
down
and
see
the
valley
and
the
water
in
the
bottom
of
it
just
like
a
river
it
was
rushing
any
more
and
i
guessed
that
whatever
happened
the
worst
of
it
was
over
pretty
soon
i
came
out
where
i
could
look
down
and
see
the
lake
all
spread
out
before
me
it
was
there
all
right
but
first
i
did
get
the
hang
of
things
because
nick
cove
was
there
at
all
there
was
just
a
kind
of
a
river
flowing
from
where
nick
cove
used
to
be
right
through
the
valley
there
were
lots
of
trees
all
uprooted
down
there
too
and
the
place
was
so
different
that
i
could
even
tell
where
the
gold
dust
twins
tent
had
been
anyhow
it
was
there
any
more
that
was
sure
all
around
the
lake
was
a
kind
of
gray
border
and
i
guess
it
showed
how
much
the
water
had
gone
down
but
gee
there
was
enough
lake
left
to
satisfy
anybody
a
scout
that
would
be
satisfied
with
what
was
left
must
be
a
hog
but
oh
boy
when
that
flood
started
it
must
have
piled
up
in
nick
valley
anyway
i
could
see
temple
camp
all
safe
across
the
water
but
the
was
way
up
in
the
air
gee
it
looked
awful
funny
there
were
half
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
temple
camp
boats
with
fellows
in
them
flopping
around
near
the
old
cove
it
was
almost
dark
but
i
could
see
them
plain
i
guess
they
had
rowed
across
just
to
look
around
and
see
how
things
looked
there
a
couple
of
hours
before
they
would
have
been
carried
right
through
on
the
flood
but
when
i
looked
down
it
was
pretty
calm
there
i
shouted
to
them
and
started
down
the
mountainside
for
the
shore
i
could
see
westy
and
and
a
couple
of
portland
scouts
in
one
of
the
boats
all
the
while
i
was
coming
down
i
kept
shouting
and
when
i
got
to
the
shore
there
were
half
a
dozen
boats
to
meet
me
elting
and
uncle
jeb
were
in
one
of
them
besides
i
could
see
half
a
dozen
fellows
plodding
around
on
shore
i
knew
they
were
looking
for
gold
dust
camp
do
bother
hunting
for
those
fellows
i
shouted
all
out
of
breath
they
all
right
they
down
at
catskill
or
somewhere
bert
winton
started
through
the
passageway
from
an
old
pit
he
got
skinny
take
me
in
and
row
down
to
rebels
cave
anybody
got
a
lantern
i
guess
they
thought
i
was
crazy
appearing
from
up
in
the
mountains
like
that
and
shouting
about
pits
and
passageways
and
rebels
cave
but
as
soon
as
elting
and
uncle
jeb
took
me
into
their
boat
i
told
them
about
all
that
happened
uncle
jeb
just
looked
at
elting
and
mr
elting
looked
awful
serious
then
uncle
jeb
shook
his
head
and
said
it
dao
come
out
through
rebels
cave
i
reckon
i
ai
never
rebel
cave
but
it
dao
come
out
thar
nohow
i
was
just
trembling
all
over
when
i
heard
him
say
that
it
was
the
only
way
he
could
do
anyway
i
said
it
must
come
out
somewhere
elting
said
we
not
blaming
you
my
boy
nor
winton
either
then
he
said
kind
of
serious
let
me
go
ashore
uncle
jeb
some
of
you
row
over
to
the
cave
here
some
of
you
boys
come
along
with
me
who
wants
to
volunteer
to
go
back
through
the
mountains
george
he
said
he
in
a
boston
troop
that
fellow
george

row
across
and
get
some
lanterns
quick
you
go
with
him
harry

your
fists

those
oars

rope
and
an
aid
kit

stay
with
uncle
jeb
roy
gee
i
can
hardly
tell
you
how
things
happened
the
next
second
fellows
were
hurrying
back
and
forth
getting
in
and
out
of
boats
while
the
one
boat
skimmed
across
to
the
camp
landing
in
a
half
a
minute
elting
and
about
a
dozen
scouts
were
standing
on
the
cove
shore
waiting
for
the
boat
to
come
back
and
meanwhile
we
rowed
down
along
the
south
shore
to
where
the
cave
is
it
about
half
way
down
to
the
outlet
you
can
see
about
where
it
is
several
other
boats
went
down
there
with
us
westy
was
in
one
of
them
and
i
made
him
come
in
our
boat
because
now
that
bert
was
gone
maybe
dead
and
skinny
too
i
just
felt
as
if
i
like
to
have
one
of
my
patrol
near
me
i
just
felt
that
way
besides
westy
was
my
special
chum
and
after
all
i
liked
him
best
of
any
when
you
feeling
kind
of
shaky
the
time
you
like
to
have
one
of
your
own
patrol
with
you
you
bet
soon
we
heard
the
boat
coming
back
and
could
see
the
lanterns
bobbing
pull
hard
i
heard
elting
call
from
the
shore
it
sounded
awful
clear
in
the
night
the
fellows
in
the
boat
rowed
straight
for
us
and
gave
us
an
aid
kit
and
a
couple
of
lanterns
that
you
blakeley
i
heard
a
fellow
say
it
was
young
winter
he
temple
secretary
and
he
always
spends
his
vacations
at
temple
camp
who
there
he
asked
uncle
jeb
and
westy
and
i
i
said
i
do
know
who
in
the
other
boats
everybody
i
guess
they
did
stop
but
a
second
and
they
pulled
for
where
elting
and
the
fellows
were
waiting
i
could
hear
their
voices
and
see
the
lanterns
rocking
as
they
hiked
up
the
side
of
the
mountains
maybe
i
ought
to
have
gone
with
them
i
said
they
find
the
place
i
reckon
uncle
jeb
said
naow
let
pull
ashore
and
root
around
the
fellows
in
the
other
boats
waited
just
rowing
around
close
to
shore
while
uncle
jeb
and
westy
and
i
climbed
up
to
the
cave
it
was
higher
above
the
lake
than
it
was
before
on
account
of
the
water
escaping
and
we
had
to
scramble
up
through
a
lot
of
mud
i
was
so
excited
i
could
keep
still
and
i
just
stumbled
into
the
cave
and
stood
there
for
a
couple
of
seconds
holding
the
lantern
it
was
as
dark
as
pitch
and
smelled
like
earth
i
kind
of
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
a
grave
i
was
sorry
i
had
ever
shouted
down
to
bert
winton
that
maybe
the
passageway
came
out
there
anyway
i
held
the
lantern
into
the
passage
way
it
was
a
sort
of
an
opening
between
two
big
rocks
inside
then
i
squeezed
myself
in
and
went
ahead
about
thirty
or
forty
feet
i
guess
and
that
was
every
bit
as
far
as
i
could
go
the
passageway
just
fizzled
out
against
a
great
big
rock
it
did
lead
anywhere
at
all
then
all
of
a
sudden
a
cold
feeling
came
over
me
and
my
fingers
just
loosened
and
i
dropped
the
lantern
it
sort
of
scared
me
when
i
heard
the
glass
crash
on
the
ground
for
about
half
a
minute
i
budge
i
just
could
go
out
and
tell
westy
and
uncle
jeb
that
it
was
all
up
with
bert
winton
i
just
could
do
it
because
i
knew
i
was
to
blame
for
shouting
that
down
to
him
like
a
fool
if
i
had
been
a
good
scout
i
would
have
that
passage
lead
anywhere
look
how
bert
was
always
finding
things
out
and
how
he
knew
all
about
the
country
around
there
i
could
just
kind
of
see
him
poking
around
with
his
stick
and
i
just
could
call
and
i
felt
sick
as
if
i
was
going
to
fall
right
down
it
was
me
that
killed
him
i
cried
and
i
heard
a
voice
say
it
was
just
an
echo
i
guess
chapter
xxxiii
tells
about
how
westy
and
i
waited
uncle
jeb
and
westy
came
in
and
saw
how
it
was
and
there
anything
more
to
do
so
we
went
back
to
the
boat
the
fellows
who
were
waiting
around
in
the
other
boats
said
it
was
my
fault
but
anyway
i
knew
it
was
uncle
jeb
said
wall
naow
you
take
it
kinder
hard
roay
remember
thars
two
strings
ter
this
here
bow
as
the
feller
says
we
got
another
party
uv
good
scouts
ter
hear
frum
yet
you
jest
come
over
ter
camp
get
a
cup
uv
hot
coffee
i
said
i
did
want
any
hot
coffee
and
that
i
was
just
going
to
wait
around
with
westy
i
just
wanted
to
be
with
westy
so
uncle
jeb
went
back
in
one
of
the
other
boats
and
westy
and
i
just
rowed
around
together
at
the
spot
where
the
others
had
started
up
the
mountain
a
couple
of
boats
were
pulled
up
so
that
the
fellows
could
cross
when
they
got
back
it
was
pitch
dark
up
the
mountainside
and
i
looked
up
to
see
if
i
could
see
any
lights
that
might
be
their
lanterns
they
ca
get
back
for
an
hour
yet
westy
said
do
let
get
too
close
to
the
new
outlet
it
may
be
running
pretty
strong
even
yet
i
said
i
do
care
a
lot
what
happens
to
me
now
well
do
westy
said
i
know
i
have
seen
much
of
you
in
the
last
couple
of
days
i
told
him
but
i
do
want
you
to
think
it
because
i
do
care
any
more
it
was
mostly
because
i
was
trying
to
help
skinny
anyway
it
all
over
now
how
did
the
fellows
treat
him
if
they
known
it
was
his
last
day
they
have
treated
him
decent
i
bet
i
did
see
him
westy
said
i
was
hunting
for
you
most
all
the
afternoon
i
going
to
stick
by
you
closer
after
this
i
said
it
was
only
because
bert
winton
was
sort
of
you
know
i
know
westy
said
everybody
fell
for
him
i
not
blaming
you
but
anyway
i
glad
i
got
you
now
i
told
him
we
were
always
good
friends
that
one
sure
thing
i
feel
mighty
lonesome
if
i
did
have
you
i
never
got
jealous
westy
said
i
always
knew
how
it
was
with
us
i
just
went
stalking
with
the
ravens
it
was
so
kind
of
slow
it
wo
be
that
way
any
more
i
told
him
and
i
just
almost
had
to
gulp
gee
i
do
know
why
only
a
couple
of
nights
ago
i
was
flopping
around
like
this
with
bert
winton
and
now
he
gone
he
was
a
hero
that
sure
and
you
and
i
are
together
again
we
heard
you
while
we
were
at
westy
said
did
you
mind
i
asked
no
i
did
mind
he
said
it
funny
how
two
fellows
get
to
be
chums
i
said
westy
did
say
anything
only
just
rowed
around
after
a
while
he
said
he
knew
how
to
feather
that
fellow
did
i
guess
his
troop
will
go
home
now
hey
maybe
he
turned
and
went
back
through
the
passage
and
they
find
him
all
safe
in
the
pit
westy
said
nope
i
told
him
the
lake
different
everything
is
changed
skinny
won
the
cross
and
he
dead
and
bert
is
dead
it
does
make
any
difference
what
the
camp
thinks
about
skinny
now
because
he
know
it
and
even
if
they
sore
still
bert
wo
know
it
they
be
back
everything
is
changed
you
just
said
you
and
i
are
not
changed
westy
said
then
we
just
rowed
around
and
neither
one
of
us
said
anything
it
was
awful
dark
and
still
how
do
you
suppose
skinny
happened
to
get
there
i
asked
westy
the
flood
carried
him
through
he
said
but
how
did
he
happen
to
be
in
the
cove
it
could
have
carried
him
through
if
he
had
been
in
the
cove
i
said
guess
we
never
know
that
i
told
him
then
we
rowed
around
some
more
and
neither
of
us
said
anything
look
up
there
and
see
if
you
think
that
a
lantern
westy
said
after
a
while
yes
it
is
i
said
they
coming
back
and
then
my
heart
began
to
thump
i
bet
they
got
them
and
that
everything
all
right
westy
said
i
kind
of
think
so
by
the
way
the
lantern
is
swinging
pretty
soon
we
saw
another
light
and
then
another
one
and
then
i
could
hear
some
of
the
fellows
talking
and
hear
twigs
crunch
under
their
feet
as
they
scrambled
down
i
did
dare
to
call
them
but
westy
called
any
news
are
they
all
right
who
there
a
fellow
called
two
fellows
from
bridgeboro
troop
westy
shouted
have
you
got
them
any
news
just
then
a
fellow
came
scrambling
down
and
stood
on
the
shore
the
whole
blamed
pit
has
fallen
in
he
said
it
just
a
pile
of
rocks
and
mud
it
filled
up
to
within
six
or
eight
feet
of
the
surface
just
collapsed
must
have
been
some
flood
over
that
way
chapter
xxxiv
tells
about
the
strange
figure
i
did
want
to
see
them
and
i
did
want
to
hear
anything
more
i
just
said
i
knew
it
to
westy
but
all
the
while
i
knew
i
had
been
hoping
all
to
myself
and
now
i
could
even
do
that
i
do
want
to
talk
to
them
i
said
let
row
along
the
north
shore
and
go
home
the
long
way
i
do
want
to
go
back
yet
i
just
want
to
stay
on
the
lake
with
westy
said
just
as
you
say
row
along
the
north
shore
i
said
i
rather
be
here
in
the
dark
just
as
you
say
he
said
awful
nice
and
friendly
like
we
could
hear
them
rowing
across
and
talking
the
lanterns
looked
like
two
little
stars
one
fellow
said
it
would
take
a
week
to
clear
out
the
pit
i
heard
elting
say
it
must
have
happened
as
soon
as
he
crawled
into
that
passage
because
the
passage
surely
did
go
far
now
are
you
satisfied
i
said
to
westy
you
see
how
i
to
blame
i
though
it
could
be
a
mile
long
winton
thought
so
too
westy
said
i
would
listen
to
anything
against
him
not
now
i
said
anyway
i
knew
he
could
be
saved
i
just
did
then
i
said
westy
bert
and
i
were
going
to
square
skinny
we
were
going
to
prove
he
did
take
the
money
and
we
were
going
to
see
he
got
the
cross
i
never
heard
you
say
what
you
thought
all
i
know
is
what
everyone
in
camp
thinks
but
listen
if
a
fellow
is
willing
to
give
up
his
life
as
bert
did
trying
to
prove
a
fellow
innocent
if
he
just
willing
to
give
up
doing
everything
else
he
sat
on
the
top
of
his
troop
cabin
he
did
and
said
to
me
don
talk
westy
said
just
sit
still
and
let
me
row
you
around
hear
that
night
hawk
then
does
that
prove
that
he
innocent
i
asked
him
any
fellow
with
any
sense
can
see
that
you
need
tell
me
what
you
think
but
the
the
gold
cross
is
dead
it
is
and
a
fellow
can
he
can
win
it
after
he
dead
and
those
elks
listen
westy
said
there
somebody
on
shore
what
do
i
care
i
said
he
said
i
know
but
maybe
it
the
gold
dust
twins
if
they
came
home
through
the
open
country
they
be
sure
to
hit
the
lake
at
the
wrong
spot
maybe
they
looking
for
their
camp
let
get
closer
in
anyway
i
did
care
much
what
he
did
if
it
had
been
for
the
gold
dust
twins
there
would
never
have
been
any
trouble
i
knew
that
i
do
care
where
you
go
i
said
a
good
turn
is
a
good
turn
westy
said
maybe
everything
has
changed
but
good
turns
have
changed
their
own
tent
is
gone
their
canoe
is
smashed
you
said
so
yourself
and
they
on
the
opposite
side
from
temple
camp
you
know
our
signboard
over
there
to
friend
or
stranger
come
on
in
and
get
them
i
said
i
do
care
i
do
care
about
anything
why
did
he
ever
try
to
paddle
across
in
all
that
rain
that
was
the
beginning
of
all
the
trouble
a
couple
of
bungling
tenderfeet
as
we
rowed
in
and
skirted
the
shore
i
could
see
a
dark
figure
following
along
at
the
edge
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
there
westy
asked
want
to
get
across
the
person
said
and
his
voice
sounded
kind
of
husky
what
for
westy
asked
him
i
guess
he
did
answer
anyway
i
did
hear
him
because
i
paying
much
attention
westy
rowed
in
and
the
fellow
stepped
out
on
a
rock
in
the
water
and
waited
i
saw
he
had
a
stick
in
his
hand
chapter
xxxv
tells
about
a
new
camp
that
you
kiddo
he
called
bert
i
said
give
us
a
lift
over
will
you
i
just
said
what
is
it
you
bert
say
yes
say
it
you
well
then
it
me
he
said
hold
her
steady
my
leg
is
stiff
all
right
shall
i
push
off
he
stood
there
in
the
boat
and
he
was
lame
and
his
left
hand
was
hanging
in
his
scout
scarf
that
was
made
into
a
sling
in
the
lantern
light
i
could
see
the
yellow
and
black
stripes
and
he
pushed
against
the
stone
with
the
stick
that
he
had
in
his
free
hand
and
started
the
boat
off
all
i
could
say
was
just
bert
and
i
held
the
lantern
close
to
him
as
he
sat
down
there
was
a
long
cut
on
his
face
and
he
did
have
any
hat
or
jacket
on
and
his
trousers
were
all
torn
and
dirty
where
did
you
where
is
skinny
i
asked
him

a
tiger

a
crutch
before
he
said
i
a
punk
tiger

d
say
royal
royal
bengal
westy
said

near
the
hudson
shore
bert

in
that
easy
way
he
had
he
at
camp
mccord
he

up
in
the
world
since
you
saw
him
bert
i
said

tell
he
said
except
skinny
and
i
are
both
on
the
job

in
the
hands
of
the
gold
dust

which
i
blurted
out
that

said
and

to
guy
those
fellows

do
it
when
i
around

fourteen
karat
gold

that
what
skinny
walked
around
to
their
camp
this
morning
to
ask
them
not
to
believe
that
he
took
the
money
poor
little
codger
westy
said
oh
he
is
so
poor
bert
said
he
in
soft
with
that
pair
he
went
around
and
asked
them
not
to
believe
it
do
you
get
that
he
asked
them
not
to
take
the
money
if
anyone
gave
it
to
them
because
it
was
that
him
they
kept
him
to
lunch
and
told
him
they
believed
him
and
that
nobody
could
cram
any
money
down
their
throats
with
a
ramrod
hey
what
do
you
think
of
that
they
may
be
green
campers
but
they
the
whitest
green
campers
i
ever
heard
of
i
said
you
said
it
bert
shouted
they
told
skinny
to
stay
right
there
with
them
and
never
mind
about
the
fellows
over
at
camp
they
told
him
he
could
have
the
tent
and
the
flag
and
the
canoe
instead
of
the
cross
and
to
just
stay
and
make
himself
at
home
when
they
started
for
the
races
down
below
catskill
they
left
him
sitting
in
the
canoe
happy
with
a
capital
after
that
you
know
what
happened
skinny
and
the
canoe
and
the
whole
shebang
went
through
the
valley
lucky
the
twins
there
when
i
got
to
catskill
with
skinny
who
should
we
meet
but
the
twins
and

and
a
lot
of
canned
stuff

chapter
xxxvi
tells
about
what
bert
told
me
he
seemed
different
from
the
way
he
was
before
he
was
all
excited
when
he
talked
and
i
could
see
he
was
just
crazy
about
those
new
plans
i
said
but
tell
us
how
you
rescued
skinny

bother
your
head

he
said

among

trees

up
the
tent
now

drainage
westy
asked

of
funny
they
digging
a
regular
panama
canal
around
that
tent
he
said
bert
i
told
him
you
know
the
rule
now
do
begin
about
rules
listen
your
scoutmaster
is
away
about
every
fellow
in
temple
camp
thinks
skinny
is
just
a
miserable
little
thief
he
went
over
to
see
those
fellows
because
well
you
know
why
they
took
him
in
and
by
jinks
he
going
to
stay
there
and
so
am
i
till
this
thing
is
fixed
up
blakeley
and
westy
he
said
and
i
could
see
he
was
pretty
serious
now
i
went
into
that
passageway
with
that
kid
on
my
back
i
was
ready
to
crawl
a
mile
and
drag
him
along
if
i
had
to
as
it
turned
out
the
passage
was
about
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
long
and
came
out
in
the
old
creek
bed
like
i
said
up
above
the
flood
area
blakeley
when
i
saw
the
light
of
day
or
the
light
of
night
rather
because
anything
was
lighter
than
that
black
hole
and
when
i
laid
that
skinny
little
kid
down
he
does
weigh
fifty
pounds
blakeley
i
just
said
to
myself
the
great
eternal
i
going
to
stick
to
him
like
glue
that
what
i
said
even
then
i
did
know
he
had
been
over
to
plead
with
those
fellows
and
ask
them
not
to
believe
he
was
a
thief
when
i
heard
that
illustration
i
went
into
that
passageway
with
that
kid
on
my
back
i
know
bert
i
told
him
you
right
i
not
thinking
about
myself
he
said
my
troop
understands
me
and
they
understand
skinny
he
could
bunk
with
us
or
with
you
fellows
but
this
is
better
i
hope
nobody
raise
a
kick
westy
said
bert
said
a
kick
we
the
ones
to
raise
a
kick
have
i
got
anything
to
say
about
it
i
bring
the
kid
here
i
not
a
horse
so
i
did
the
next
best
thing
i
carried
him
down
the
old
creek
bed
a
ways
to
where
the
water
flowed
into
it
it
was
flowing
easy
then
i
laced
a
couple
of
broken
off
branches
together
and
made
the
craziest
raft
ever
saw
then
i
laid
the
kid
on
it
and
held
his
head
and
poled
with
the
other
hand
and
that
way
we
got
down
to
the
hudson
i
intended
to
get
him
to
some
house
down
there
and
then
notify
camp
he
was
a
little
better
by
then
and
a
fellow
stayed
with
him
near
the
shore
while
i
rowed
over
to
catskill
for
some
iodine
and
stuff
would
you
believe
it
i
ran
plunk
into
the
gold
dust
twins
in
the
drug
store
they
were
drinking
sodas
they
got
you
beaten
seven
ways
at
that
game
well
i
told
them
all
about
the
flood
and
how
i
found
skinny
and
how
their
camp
was
carried
away
and
they
did
seem
to
take
it
hard
at
all
they
just
laughed
and
said
it
was
part
of
the
game
oh
blakeley
he
said
then
was
when
the
fun
started
telegrams
one
of
them
had
to
buy
out
a
peanut
stand
for
skinny
and
then
for
a
tent
we
rooted
out
that
old
sail
maker
from
bed
and
made
him
sell
us
a
tent
they
gave
him
an
order
for
a
flag
mind
you
laugh
i
just
followed
them
around
they
two
of
the
gamest
sports
you
ever
saw
we
went
back
to
the
landing
in
a
taxi
with
cans
of
food
rolling
all
over
the
floor
one
of
them
shouted
to
the
taxi
man
i
fire
a
can
of
pickled
beets
at
your
head
we
hired
a
to
take
us
over
and
then
they
retired
from
the
game
some
whirligig
take
it
from
me
illustration
map
this
map
shows
you
how
the
water
broke
through
frick
cove
and
flowed
into
the
old
creek
bed
but
they
would
pick
out
the
place
for
a
camp
bert
said
they
made
me
do
that
do
want
to
be
drowned
out
again
they
said
honest
westy
those
two
fellows
are
down
there
now
digging
a
drain
ditch
and
carrying
it
way
over
to
the
hudson
what
they
said
and
skinny
sitting
there
with
a
bandage
around
his
head
eating
peanuts
as
soon
as
bert
got
out
of
the
boat
he
started
right
off
up
the
hill
for
tigers
den
as
they
called
it
we
could
see
him
stumbling
up
the
path
limping
to
favor
his
leg
he
go
back
by
the
road
i
suppose
i
said
westy
and
i
just
sat
in
the
boat
watching
until
we
could
see
him
any
more
then
he
said
scout
hey
chapter
xxxvii
tells
about
how
i
visited
camp
mc
cord
of
course
everybody
in
camp
said
that
bert
winton
was
a
wonder
they
could
help
saying
that
his
own
troop
did
seem
to
think
so
much
about
it
one
of
them
said
to
me
that
he
guessed
bert
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
they
were
funny
in
that
way
those
tigers
they
did
seem
to
get
excited
over
him
at
all
none
of
them
went
around
shouting
the
next
morning
everybody
was
talking
about
bert
all
the
time
fellows
kept
going
over
in
boats
to
see
the
remains
of
nick
cove
and
most
all
they
talked
about
was
bert
some
of
them
said
skinny
was
worth
it
they
meant
being
rescued
like
that
i
could
see
they
all
thought
that
he
took
the
money
some
said
he
was
crazy
some
of
them
thought
he
knew
about
the
money
and
just
swam
out
for
that
the
elks
did
seem
to
care
much
connie
told
a
fellow
that
he
thought
they
had
a
peach
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
lemon
i
guess
he
thought
that
was
funny
i
told
vic
norris
about
how
bert
held
skinny
tight
and
he
said
bert
was
some
lemon
squeezer
it
made
me
mad
and
i
just
walked
away
i
do
know
what
would
have
happened
if
ellsworth
had
been
there
i
guessed
he
had
the
money
still
because
i
knew
he
was
called
away
in
a
hurry
i
did
know
whether
he
had
sent
for
the
cross
or
not
i
do
know
what
the
directors
thought
i
guessed
maybe
they
decided
not
to
do
anything
till
ellsworth
got
back
anyway
skinny
stayed
where
he
was
george
bent
he
in
a
troop
from
washington
told
me
that
storer
went
down
to
the
hudson
early
in
the
morning
to
see
how
everything
was
i
guess
maybe
he
did
because
temple
camp
would
be
responsible
for
skinny
until
he
was
sent
away
george
said
they
gave
storer
a
doughnut
down
there
and
that
it
hurt
him
i
do
know
whether
they
threw
it
at
him
or
gave
it
to
him
to
eat
either
way
it
might
have
hurt
him
anyway
i
was
glad
skinny
was
away
on
account
of
the
way
the
fellows
felt
about
him
the
next
afternoon
westy
and
i
hiked
down
to
see
the
new
camp
i
have
to
admit
they
had
everything
fine
those
gold
dust
twins
were
older
than
most
of
the
fellows
at
camp
and
now
that
they
had
something
special
to
be
interested
in
i
could
see
that
they
were
pretty
game
we
going
to
fight
it
out
on
these
lines
if
it
takes
all
summer
that
what
one
of
them
said
and
the
other
one
said
that
us
forever
they
seemed
to
be
getting
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
it
anyway
i
believe
either
one
of
them
knew
much
about
the
gold
cross
but
they
were
going
to
see
skinny
win
it
was
funny
to
hear
them
talk
about
scouting
the
big
one
the
one
called
reggie
asked
me
if
we
had
a
badge
for
dancing
can
you
beat
that
he
said
he
thought
he
might
make
a
stab
for
it
the
other
one
thought
that
stalking
meant
picking
corn
off
the
stalk
they
seemed
to
like
bert
a
lot
but
i
guess
it
was
skinny
going
over
to
see
them
that
got
them
interested
when
he
asked
them
to
believe
in
him
and
not
take
the
money
that
was
what
clinched
it
that
what
think
anyway
that
what
bert
told
me
he
said
that
was
what
started
camp
mccord
skinny
was
all
bunged
up
but
oh
boy
you
should
have
seen
the
scout
smile
when
he
saw
me
if
that
smile
had
been
any
longer
it
would
have
cut
his
head
off
he
said
he
was
a
hero
and
that
he
had
a
camp
of
his
own
now
poor
little
duffer
he
did
mean
to
be
boasting
it
was
only
that
funny
way
he
had
westy
and
bert
and
i
took
a
little
walk
and
i
said
the
only
trouble
is
suppose
we
should
get
the
letter
maybe
the
money
does
belong
to
the
lieutenant
then
what
well
then
we
find
out
who
it
does
belong
to
that
what
bert
said
camp
mccord
does
strike
its
colors
as
easily
as
all
that
back
i
told
him
no
ellsworth
was
back
yet
then
i
said
maybe
lieutenant
donnelle
was
sent
away
maybe
he
had
to
go
to
south
africa
on
account
of
the
league
of
nations
i
read
that
the
zulu
were
having
a
war
you
a
regular
calamity
jane
bert
said
ca
you
think
of
something
better
than
that
to
worry
about
chapter
xxxviii
tells
about
the
scout
pace
we
had
it
fixed
that
as
soon
as
i
got
a
letter
i
would
start
right
down
to
camp
mccord
with
it
and
oh
boy
did
i
hang
around
administration
shack
where
the
camp
mail
was
sorted
i
guess
my
patrol
thought
i
was
crazy
and
i
bet
that
robin
in
the
maple
tree
wondered
what
had
become
of
me
gee
you
can
say
i
was
a
calamity
jane
if
you
want
to
but
honest
i
had
lieutenant
donnelle
sent
all
over
the
world
one
minute
i
was
saying
he
was
dead
and
the
next
minute
i
was
saying
he
had
gone
to
russia
and
the
next
minute
i
was
saying
the
money
was
his
at
all
then
i
was
saying
that
he
be
mad
because
i
told
bert
about
him
and
would
send
any
answer
at
all
then
i
get
to
thinking
about
bert
and
that
would
kind
of
cheer
me
up
because
he
was
so
sure
three
days
went
by
and
no
letter
came
every
time
they
handed
me
a
letter
i
be
shaky
all
over
till
i
saw
who
it
was
from
and
then
just
be
all
down
and
out
when
i
see
it
was
from
my
mother
or
my
father
even
the
letters
with
my
allowance
in
did
make
me
feel
good
so
you
can
see
from
that
how
anxious
i
was
all
the
fellows
around
camp
did
say
much
about
skinny
they
thought
he
was
just
a
little
thief
but
anyway
they
were
the
kind
of
fellows
to
be
always
talking
about
it
they
had
something
else
to
do
they
talked
a
lot
about
bert
though
and
said
he
was
a
kind
of
a
crank
about
skinny
but
anyway
they
admitted
that
he
was
a
hero
gee
they
to
do
that
all
the
while
i
did
go
down
to
see
bert
and
he
did
come
up
to
camp
i
just
did
want
to
go
unless
i
had
the
letter
reggie
hiked
up
one
day
and
wanted
to
know
if
he
could
borrow
a
pair
of
smoked
glasses
the
fellows
here
do
smoke
doc
carson
told
him
it
was
a
shame
to
guy
him
he
was
such
a
nice
fellow
but
oh
boy
i
had
to
laugh
to
see
him
start
back
with
that
pair
of
big
auto
goggles
on
but
anyhow
all
the
fellows
admitted
that
the
gold
dust
twins
were
all
right
they
were
terrible
bunglers
when
it
came
to
scouting
and
they
even
laughed
at
themselves
that
was
the
best
part
of
it
but
you
know
what
a
tin
horn
sport
is
well
they
were
that
anyway
they
had
one
of
those
long
fancy
brass
things
with
a
wax
taper
to
light
their
with
honest
it
was
a
scream
i
guess
it
was
used
in
the
parlor
at
home
to
reach
the
chandelier
with
well
it
got
to
be
tuesday
and
no
letter
came
oh
was
i
discouraged
i
just
started
out
through
the
woods
because
i
want
to
see
anybody
all
of
a
sudden
who
should
i
meet
but
he
motioned
to
me
to
keep
still
because
he
was
stalking
a
even
though
i
did
feel
much
like
laughing
i
had
to
laugh
why
do
you
track
an
angleworm
some
day
i
said
he
said
what
the
matter
with
you
lately
nothing
much
i
told
him
you
do
hang
out
with
the
fellows
at
all
he
said
we
having
a
lot
of
thrilling
adventures
thrilling
hey
i
said
and
i
just
had
to
laugh
because
it
was
the
same
old
with
his
escapes
and
thrilling
adventures
and
all
that
stuff
well
i
said
you
want
to
be
careful
it
pretty
dangerous
business
stalking

came
all
the
way
from
catskill
scout
pace
he
said
i
said

you

did
it
in
minutes

you
worry
he
said
it
come
i
fix
it
for
you
you
one
bully
little
fixer
i
said
because
he
was
always
talking
about
fixing
things
but
if
uncle
sam
does
bring
it
ca
but
anyway
you
and
i
are
going
to
have
a
good
hike
you
little
raving
raven
i
said
just
as
soon
as
we
can
i
know
i
have
seen
much
of
you
but
it
is
because
i
do
like
you
he
just
said
and
went
off
on
tiptoe
through
the
woods
stalking
his
he
a
mighty
nice
little
fellow
is
and
he
a
bully
little
scout
scout
pace
and
good
turns
those
are
his
specialties
he
just
stalks
on
the
side
late
that
night
ellsworth
came
back
the
bus
brought
him
up
from
catskill
i
did
see
him
but
early
in
the
morning
on
my
way
over
to
wait
for
the
mail
i
met
vic
norris
and
hunt
ward
of
the
elks
vic
norris
said
this
be
the
end
of
camp
mccord
is
going
to
take
skinny
to
bridgeboro
this
morning
oh
is
that
so
i
said
skinny
is
with
the
gold
dust
twins
and
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
temple
camp
skinny
is
in
ellsworth
care
hunt
ward
said
pretty
soon
he
be
in
the
reformatory
care
vic
blurted
out
yes
i
said
and
all
because
you
had
his
head
all
turned
with
swimming
before
he
even
passed
his
second
class
tests
you
were
glad
enough
to
use
him
you
were
glad
enough
to
see
his
poor
little
skinny
legs
kicking
in
the
water
just
so
as
you
could
get
something
out
of
it
now
you
throw
him
down
those
gold
dust
twins
are
better
scouts
than
you
are
they
are
you
not
fit
to
stay
in
the
same
camp
with
bert
winton
you
in
my
own
troop
but
i
tell
you
that
you
leave
ellsworth
out
of
it
who
says
so
vic
shouted
i
say
so
i
told
him
you
do
hear
ellsworth
around
saying
mean
things
about
skinny
do
you
you
leave
ellsworth
out
of
it
it
none
of
your
business
what
he
does
even
if
skinny
does
go
back
the
least
you
can
do
is
keep
still
about
it
you
do
hear
those
tigers
around
talking
do
you
i
guess
not
or
my
patrol
either
you
keep
your
mouths
shut
about
skinny
then
i
went
over
to
administration
shack
to
wait
for
the
mail
to
be
sorted
the
reason
i
did
say
more
to
vic
and
hunt
was
just
because
i
was
getting
discouraged
and
in
my
heart
i
thought
maybe
skinny
would
have
to
go
i
knew
that
camp
mccord
was
no
use
if
ellsworth
said
he
must
go
back
i
was
glad
i
did
say
any
more
because
anyway
there
was
no
letter
there
chapter
xxxix
tells
about
how
camp
mc
cord
did
strike
its
colors
there
were
a
lot
of
us
hanging
around
administration
shack
and
i
heard
a
couple
of
fellows
say
that
ellsworth
was
going
down
in
the
bus
to
catch
the
train
they
said
he
was
going
to
stop
at
camp
mccord
for
skinny
he
likely
to
get
a
doughnut
thrown
at
his
head
one
of
them
said
and
they
all
laughed
i
just
listen
to
them
after
the
mail
was
distributed
and
i
saw
there
was
anything
for
me
i
just
went
in
and
said
to
slaty
i
said
are
you
there
anything
would
you
mind
looking
again
i
knew
it
was
any
use
and
i
guess
he
did
too
but
anyway
he
looked
and
said
no
then
i
started
back
to
silver
fox
cabin
i
guess
i
never
felt
worse
than
i
did
then
first
i
thought
i
just
go
and
beg
ellsworth
not
to
take
skinny
away
from
camp
mccord
anyway
even
if
he
could
have
the
cross
i
was
hanging
my
head
and
just
kind
of
wandering
along
and
wondering
what
i
say
to
bert
and
the
twins
i
could
just
sort
of
see
that
new
flag
with
camp
mccord
on
it
and
i
could
hear
bert
saying
camp
mccord
does
strike
its
colors
as
easily
as
all
that
anyway
what
more
could
i
do
i
knew
ellsworth
would
be
nice
to
me
but
that
he
would
do
anything
just
because
wanted
him
to
i
said
to
myself
it
all
up
nobody
can
do
anything
now
skinny
was
born
unlucky
poor
little
kid
all
of
a
sudden
i
stumbled
plunk
into
as
he
came
around
the
corner
of
the
big
pavilion
what
in
i
began
got
it
for
you
i
got
it
for
you
he
shouted
minutes
scout
pace
beat
my
record
i
thought
maybe
it
come
in
the
reg
in
the
reg
in
the
reg
he
was
so
out
of
breath
he
could
talk
there
a
sec
there
a
sec
there
a
second
train
here
and
then
he
handed
me
a
letter
there
there
are
two
he
said
this
one
for
you
my
hand
trembled
so
i
could
hardly
open
the
envelope
and
honest
i
could
hardly
speak
to
him
i
just
blurted
out
you
the
bulliest
little
scout
in
this
camp
you
and
your
scout
pacing
just
the
best
little
scout
that
ever
was
give
me
your
hand
you
bully
little
raving
raven
talk
about
good
turns
oh
you
just
honest
i
could
finish
and
i
stood
there
with
my
eyes
all
sort
of
wet
and
watched
him
start
up
again
scout
pace
see
you
later
he
called
back
i
want
to
make
administration
shack
in
fifty
minutes
that
was
him
all
over
this
was
the
letter
and
oh
boy
you
bet
i
always
keep
it
because
that
was
my
lucky
day
even
since
then
wednesday
has
been
my
lucky
day
when
i
get
a
good
stalking
snapshot
it
always
on
a
wednesday
skeezeks
old
pal
yours
received
have
sent
letter
to
your
superior
officer
or
whatever
you
call
him
will
be
up
after
my
two
hundred
buckarinos
next
week
could
you
put
me
up
for
a
couple
of
nights
i
show
you
how
to
roast
potatoes
french
style
and
we
have
a
hike
everything
so
do
worry
you
a
little
brick
in
a
hurry
believe
me
i
read
that
letter
about
seven
times
but
even
then
i
would
go
to
see
ellsworth
because
i
wanted
to
wait
till
the
other
letter
was
sent
over
to
him
from
the
shack
i
guess
i
waited
about
half
an
hour
because
i
wanted
to
give
him
a
chance
to
read
his
seven
times
too
then
i
went
to
his
tent
where
i
knew
he
be
getting
ready
to
start
away
i
just
said
kind
of
sober
like
can
i
take
your
grip
over
to
the
bus
for
you
mr
ellsworth
oh
boy
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
guess
you
have
to
root
around
and
find
another
good
turn
for
roy
he
said
something
has
happened
i
just
said
very
sober
like
because
i
not
afraid
of
him
did
skinny
take
any
more
money
he
said
here
read
this
you
little
silver
fox
and
then
clear
out
and
give
me
a
chance
to
get
my
wits
together
you
right
and
i
wrong
as
you
usually
are
i
mean
as
i
usually
am
i
do
know
what
i
mean
here
read
this
and
then
see
your
scout
smile
you
little
rascal
this
is
how
the
letter
read
c
ellsworth
temple
camp
dear
sir
may
i
ask
you
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
forcing
open
the
second
locker
in
my
father
and
rescuing
a
sum
of
money
which
i
carelessly
left
there
i
think
you
will
find
it
in
an
old
pair
of
trousers
belonging
to
me
the
amount
is
a
little
over
two
hundred
dollars
i
would
greatly
appreciate
it
if
you
will
hold
this
in
safe
keeping
till
i
have
a
chance
to
visit
your
camp
i
hope
you
will
not
consider
that
i
am
presuming
upon
a
very
slight
acquaintance
in
asking
you
to
do
me
this
service
sincerely
yours
lieutenant
harry
donnelle
stationed
at
camp
dix
wrightstown
oh
boy
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
about
everything
i
do
know
what
ellsworth
told
the
elks
i
should
worry
about
that
he
knew
how
to
handle
them
you
can
bet
oh
bibbie
but
he
one
peachy
scoutmaster
pretty
soon
everybody
in
camp
was
talking
but
i
did
pay
any
attention
a
fellow
from
virginia
came
up
and
told
me
they
were
going
to
have
the
fixed
what
do
you
know
about
that
i
said
get
out
from
under
and
do
bother
me
i
have
something
else
to
think
about
i
did
eat
much
dinner
maybe
you
wo
believe
it
but
i
did
right
afterward
i
started
down
to
the
hudson
i
saw
a
tracks
but
i
did
bother
with
them
i
should
worry
about
woodchucks
i
did
even
stop
in
the
village
to
have
a
soda
i
got
some
ice
cream
in
a
paper
so
i
could
eat
it
going
along
and
oh
boy
when
i
saw
that
new
flag
in
among
the
trees
did
i
just
shout
it
said
in
big
red
letters
oh
they
were
dandy
fellows
those
gold
dust
twins
then
i
thought
of
what
bert
said
about
camp
mccord
not
striking
its
colors
i
noticed
they
did
have
their
door
to
the
south
but
anyway
that
did
matter
the
north
is
all
right
sometimes
i
just
went
running
in
there
pell
mell
hurrah
for
camp
mccord
i
shouted
you
were
right
about
not
striking
your
colors
but
i
strike
you
all
right
you
old
bengal
tiger
and
i
gave
bert
winton
a
thump
that
nearly
knocked
him
over
good
night
do
you
know
enough
to
have
your
door
open
to
the
south
or
east
or
west
what
the
difference
i
just
yelled
hurrah
lieutenant
donnelle
is
coming
to
get
his
two
hundred
and
i
going
to
make
him
stay
till
skin
i
mean
alfred
gets
the
cross
three
cheers
for
the
gold
dust
twins
and
anybody
who
says
just
a
minute
bert
said
calm
down
you
talking
in
chunks
why
should
i
talk
in
chunks
i
like
to
know
i
said
then
i
told
them
all
about
it
it
going
to
be
just
as
you
said
i
told
them
we
going
to
make
the
elks
come
down
here
and
give
him
the
cross
when
it
comes
ellsworth
says
all
right
oh
but
he
was
fine
about
it
he
said
only
fair
is
he
some
scoutmaster
but
you
do
have
to
be
in
the
scouts
the
fellow
they
called
reggie
just
came
over
and
put
his
hand
over
my
shoulder
awful
nice
yes
you
do
he
said
you
have
to
be
in
the
scouts
we
wo
hear
any
talk
against
the
scouts
here
oh
but
he
was
one
fine
fellow
i
do
care
if
he
did
know
anything
about
digging
a
drain
ditch
and
all
that
but
anyway
i
just
ca
tell
you
all
we
said
and
one
thing
you
should
have
seen
skinny
that
all
i
got
to
say
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
after
a
little
while
when
the
rumpus
was
over
bert
and
i
walked
over
to
the
shore
of
the
river
and
sat
down
and
just
looked
across
at
catskill
and
the
big
hills
in
back
i
kind
of
felt
as
if
i
like
to
be
alone
with
him
a
little
while
i
said
you
did
it
all
bert
the
whole
camp
is
crazy
about
you
those
campers
are
bully
scouts
he
said
i
said
yes
but
if
it
was
for
if
it
was
for
skinny
would
be
on
that
train
he
said
we
listened
and
could
hear
the
west
shore
train
coming
along
and
could
see
the
smoke
blowing
away
into
the
mountains
it
seemed
as
if
that
train
did
care
for
anything
or
anybody
pretty
soon
it
would
be
in
the
hot
city
and
the
people
on
it
would
go
through
big
gates
and
across
in
ferries
and
up
the
streets
all
filled
with
people
and
everything
would
be
hot
and
stuffy
but
skinny
would
be
on
it
we
saw
it
stop
at
the
station
in
catskill
and
we
heard
the
bell
ring
and
saw
it
start
again
and
go
scooting
along
the
shore
and
far
away
till
we
could
see
it
any
more
only
the
smoke
but
anyway
skinny
was
on
it
kind
of
as
you
might
say
can
even
beat
a
train
going
scout
pace
i
said
it
go
winding
and
turning
in
and
out
along
the
shore
bert
said
but
can
beat
it
on
good
turns
yop
i
said
after
that
we
did
say
anything
for
about
five
minutes
then
i
said
one
thing
sure
ought
to
get
the
gold
cross
he
did
say
anything
only
broke
a
stick
off
a
bush
and
began
marking
on
the
grass
with
it
what
do
i
want
with
the
cross
he
said
it
a
big
honor
i
told
him
sure
he
said
you
deserve
it
for
what
you
did
i
told
him
you
ought
to
it
you
ought
to
want
to
have
it
on
account
of
your
patrol
nice
fellows
eh
he
said
well
then
why
do
you
take
more
interest
in
it
for
sake
ever
notice
how
blue
the
hudson
is
above
poughkeepsie
he
said
i
did
say
anything
just
looked
at
the
river
then
all
of
a
sudden
a
thought
came
to
me
i
said
bert
you
got
the
cross
already
have
you
why
you
tell
me
dunno
did
think
of
it
i
guess
he
said
tell
me
how
you
won
it
bert
i
said
tell
me
but
he
just
kept
poking
around
with
the
stick
and
would
tell
me
look
at
that
worm
he
said
and
he
held
one
up
on
his
stick
good
fishing
bait
around
here
hey
what
d
say
we
go
back
that
was
just
like
him
exactly
like
illustration
let
go
i
got
him
