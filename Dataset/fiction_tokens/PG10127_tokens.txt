true

chapter
one
the
abduction
the
boy
was
doing
his
homework
his
parents
had
taken
his
little
brother
to
see
to
at
the
movie
theater
he
had
seen
it
when
it
first
came
out
and
although
he
enjoyed
it
at
the
time
he
felt
he
was
getting
too
old
for
that
sort
of
stuff
besides
he
had
too
much
work
to
do
it
seemed
to
him
that
each
teacher
allocated
enough
work
to
practically
take
up
a
fellow
entire
evening
as
if
their
class
was
the
only
one
so
graham
for
that
was
his
name
knew
he
would
have
to
work
for
several
more
hours
if
he
was
to
complete
all
the
assignments
graham
began
to
work
on
his
math
problems
but
he
could
not
concentrate
his
mind
drifted
off
to
the
original
frank
baum
story
wonderful
wizard
of
he
was
thinking
about
the
characters
in
it
and
what
a
terrific
imagination
baum
must
have
had
when
suddenly
out
of
the
stillness
of
the
house
came
a
weird
screeching
sound
the
sound
was
like
nothing
he
had
ever
heard
before
it
seemed
to
have
come
from
behind
him
from
the
vicinity
of
the
fireplace
graham
shivered
he
did
not
believe
in
ghosts
and
at
twelve
years
old
almost
thirteen
he
should
not
be
afraid
to
be
home
alone
but
he
was
scared
right
now
no
question
about
it
however
when
no
other
sound
was
forthcoming
he
began
to
rationalize
that
it
had
all
been
his
imagination
perhaps
just
the
wind
whistling
down
the
chimney
then
it
happened
the
awful
sound
of
breaking
glass
oh
no
he
thought
someone
is
breaking
in
he
looked
over
to
the
window
then
to
the
french
doors
nothing
yet
the
sound
had
seemed
very
close
he
glanced
at
the
mirror
above
the
fireplace
only
to
see
that
all
the
glass
had
gone
leaving
an
empty
frame
now
he
was
really
frightened
he
wondered
what
had
caused
the
glass
to
shatter
then
to
his
amazement
all
the
pieces
of
slivered
glass
suddenly
flew
up
from
the
fireplace
and
reconstructed
themselves
in
the
frame
i
must
be
going
crazy
thought
the
poor
lad
all
this
school
work
is
getting
to
be
too
much
for
me
i
must
have
cracked
completely
then
all
the
lights
in
the
house
went
out
leaving
him
in
pitch
blackness
at
that
moment
there
was
a
strange
crackling
sound
and
the
mirror
became
illuminated
with
a
purple
glow
a
grotesquely
human
face
began
to
form
into
the
image
of
an
evil
witch
a
loud
screechy
cackle
emanated
from
her
throat
it
was
the
same
sound
he
had
heard
earlier
by
now
graham
was
absolutely
frozen
with
fear
the
witch
evil
eyes
glared
at
him
as
she
screamed
so
my
little
man
we
meet
at
last
you
have
hated
me
ever
since
you
first
read
about
me
have
you
have
you
she
shouted
answer
me
you
little
brat
she
reached
her
arms
out
of
the
mirror
grabbed
him
and
shook
him
hard
she
shook
and
shook
until
he
thought
he
was
going
to
be
sick
then
she
lifted
him
right
up
off
the
floor
and
into
the
mirror
by
now
graham
was
absolutely
terrified
he
kicked
and
screamed
and
tried
to
escape
but
to
no
avail
the
witch
was
much
too
strong
for
him
he
found
himself
dragged
to
the
other
side
of
the
mirror
and
out
into
a
room
in
the
witch
castle
whereupon
the
witch
immediately
released
her
grip
for
she
knew
that
the
boy
had
nowhere
to
run
well
what
say
you
now
squirt
do
you
still
hate
me
cackled
the
witch
breaking
into
fits
of
hideous
laughter
oh
no
not
anymore
replied
graham
his
voice
trembling
i
think
you
pretty
nice
um
all
things
considered
oh
come
now
replied
the
witch
let
be
reasonable
you
really
think
that
you
just
afraid
of
what
i
might
do
to
you
look
at
you
you
shaking
in
your
boots
i
afraid
yes
said
graham
really
afraid
but
i
do
think
harm
me
after
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
oh
replied
the
witch
really
and
what
might
that
be
graham
knew
he
had
piqued
her
interest
and
was
now
desperately
trying
to
think
of
a
plausible
story
that
would
keep
her
occupied
while
he
tried
to
figure
out
a
way
to
escape
he
had
managed
to
see
out
of
one
of
her
windows
and
knew
he
was
without
a
doubt
in
the
land
of
oz
illustration
chapter
two
historical
background
now
in
the
event
that
this
book
may
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
someone
who
is
unfamiliar
with
the
marvelous
land
of
oz
it
seems
fitting
that
an
explanation
be
inserted
right
about
here
oz
is
an
country
that
is
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
vast
deadly
desert
that
is
supposed
to
keep
visitors
out
even
so
it
has
been
visited
by
any
number
of
american
children
prior
to
graham
visit
some
came
by
way
of
invitation
but
mostly
they
arrived
by
accident
the
most
famous
of
these
visitors
of
course
was
little
dorothy
gale
dorothy
traveled
to
oz
via
a
powerful
cyclone
which
carried
her
house
and
herself
over
the
massive
desert
and
plopped
her
on
top
of
a
particularly
evil
witch
with
the
help
of
a
live
scarecrow
a
man
made
out
of
tin
and
a
cowardly
lion
she
was
able
to
find
her
way
back
to
her
home
in
america
she
returned
a
short
time
later
and
had
a
wonderful
new
series
of
adventures
in
which
she
met
princess
saari
gayelette
and
even
some
fuzzy
yellow
wogglebugs
it
was
but
a
few
years
after
that
when
little
dorothy
finally
consented
to
become
a
citizen
of
oz
and
live
there
happily
or
reasonably
so
for
many
years
thereafter
in
fact
even
after
nearly
years
she
remains
an
honorary
princess
of
that
lovely
country
because
no
one
has
to
ever
grow
old
or
die
in
this
singular
land
dorothy
remains
as
young
and
innocent
as
on
the
day
she
first
arrived
at
one
point
dorothy
was
joined
by
a
fine
young
boy
named
who
was
about
as
bright
as
a
button
trot
griffiths
betsy
bobbin
and
several
others
have
also
agreed
to
live
the
rest
of
their
days
in
oz
rather
than
returning
home
to
the
mortal
lands
where
illness
and
death
and
aging
are
common
because
oz
citizens
only
age
when
they
wish
to
do
so
on
one
birthday
all
one
is
required
to
do
is
to
wish
to
stay
the
same
age
for
another
year
and
it
will
be
so
this
would
certainly
please
most
of
the
people
in
our
mortal
lands
but
it
would
hardly
be
practical
here
due
to
the
overpopulation
problem
illustration
the
land
of
oz
is
divided
into
five
sections
to
the
north
is
the
gillikin
territory
the
gillikins
favor
the
color
purple
above
all
others
and
are
known
to
paint
their
homes
barns
and
silos
in
this
color
to
the
south
lies
the
land
of
the
quadlings
here
the
revered
color
is
red
the
area
is
governed
by
a
powerful
but
good
witch
named
glinda
and
glinda
is
considered
an
enemy
to
all
of
the
evil
witches
the
very
center
is
the
emerald
city
it
has
been
called
the
most
glorious
place
on
the
face
of
the
earth
or
even
the
moon
or
mars
and
rightly
so
it
is
so
lovely
in
fact
that
it
defies
description
and
it
is
from
here
that
the
overall
ruler
is
able
to
reign
above
all
five
regions
in
the
west
can
be
found
the
yellow
winkie
country
the
emperor
of
this
region
is
none
other
than
nick
chopper
the
tin
man
who
had
befriended
dorothy
on
her
first
visit
to
oz
to
the
east
is
the
blue
munchkin
country
here
all
of
the
things
that
the
gillikins
paint
purple
are
painted
blue
this
is
the
region
where
little
dorothy
house
had
fallen
down
atop
the
wicked
witch
of
the
east
and
it
was
this
incident
that
had
caused
the
wicked
witch
of
the
west
to
take
notice
of
the
little
girl
so
wicked
was
this
witch
in
fact
that
she
sent
a
host
of
plagues
in
the
hope
that
they
would
destroy
poor
dorothy
and
her
companions
she
lashed
out
with
her
gray
wolves
her
sinister
crows
and
her
horrific
stinging
bees
but
it
was
not
until
she
called
upon
her
marvelous
flying
monkeys
that
she
was
able
to
succeed
in
her
goal
the
monkeys
enslaved
by
the
powers
of
a
magical
hat
destroyed
the
scarecrow
and
tin
man
and
enslaved
dorothy
and
the
lion
oz
history
would
have
been
dismal
indeed
had
dorothy
not
splashed
a
bucket
of
water
over
the
wicked
witch
wetting
her
from
head
to
foot
as
witches
and
water
do
not
mix
very
well
the
evil
woman
was
reduced
to
nothing
more
than
a
puddle
of
ugly
liquid
with
the
help
of
some
kindly
winkie
tinsmiths
and
seamstresses
dorothy
was
able
to
retrieve
her
friends
and
bring
happiness
back
to
oz
had
she
desired
to
live
there
then
she
would
have
had
a
welcoming
home
with
any
or
all
of
the
citizens
of
oz
even
the
scarecrow
who
was
made
ruler
over
all
the
land
the
scarecrow
was
a
good
and
honest
king
a
thing
that
rarely
happens
in
the
mortal
lands
but
was
not
to
stay
long
in
that
position
instead
he
had
gladly
handed
over
his
crown
to
the
rightful
ruler
of
oz
princess
ozma
even
though
she
is
but
a
child
ozma
has
become
the
most
ruler
in
all
the
earth
citizens
of
oz
love
her
like
a
sister
while
children
of
other
countries
who
read
oz
books
yearn
to
leave
their
homes
to
go
to
that
wonderful
country
to
be
near
to
her
illustration
of
course
oz
is
a
very
big
place
but
if
all
of
us
who
wished
to
go
there
were
suddenly
whisked
away
on
a
cyclone
of
our
own
it
would
surely
become
decidedly
too
crowded
so
it
is
good
for
oz
that
we
are
made
to
stay
here
except
on
the
rare
occasion
when
ozma
may
call
upon
one
of
us
or
one
of
us
may
find
oz
by
accident
chapter
three
prelude
to
the
parade
dorothy
and
ozma
have
become
fast
friends
over
the
many
ageless
years
only
on
rare
occasions
is
the
incident
with
the
wicked
witch
discussed
any
more
once
a
year
on
the
day
of
the
anniversary
there
is
a
parade
and
a
feast
but
the
reason
for
these
festivities
is
not
generally
acknowledged
the
very
fact
that
dear
little
dorothy
is
present
is
considered
reason
enough
to
celebrate
oz
people
it
should
be
told
will
accept
any
excuse
to
have
a
celebration
and
the
celebration
might
well
have
continued
as
it
always
had
except
that
something
most
peculiar
had
happened
this
year
sir
simon
the
shrew
who
had
come
to
live
in
the
emerald
city
after
princess
ozma
had
magically
enlarged
him
to
had
become
very
good
friends
with
dorothy
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
annual
festival
should
better
commemorate
the
event
on
which
it
was
founded
he
determined
that
the
most
elaborate
float
in
the
parade
should
be
one
which
depicted
dorothy
dousing
the
wicked
witch
with
water
because
he
was
now
as
large
as
a
human
child
simon
was
able
to
gather
together
the
materials
he
needed
in
record
time
although
he
was
hardly
denslow
or
frank
kramer
simon
artistic
abilities
were
far
superior
to
those
of
dirk
borrowing
the
red
wagon
he
created
a
large
platform
on
which
he
could
build
his
float
he
arranged
with
kabumpo
the
elegant
elephant
to
draw
the
float
through
the
streets
as
he
thought
it
would
be
too
heavy
for
the
sawhorse
kabumpo
agreed
to
this
only
because
he
respected
dorothy
and
because
he
enjoyed
parades
he
was
still
a
tad
disgruntled
about
being
used
as
a
but
he
allowed
this
feeling
to
be
repressed
in
favor
of
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
the
parade
he
was
after
all
a
bit
of
a
when
he
could
get
away
with
it
and
that
is
a
real
understatement
sir
simon
the
shrew
was
able
to
construct
upon
the
red
wagon
a
magnificent
papier
maché
image
that
kind
of
resembled
dorothy
she
wore
one
shoe
which
simon
coated
with
glue
and
sprinkled
with
silver
glitter
he
deftly
colored
her
dress
blue
and
white
and
gave
her
two
braids
in
her
ribbon
hair
he
stood
back
and
admired
his
masterpiece
wow
said
simon
this
will
get
a
lot
of
attention
but
he
still
had
to
make
the
wicked
witch
this
was
a
harder
prospect
as
simon
did
not
like
to
create
anything
that
was
ugly
to
be
sure
there
are
very
few
people
or
things
that
are
uglier
than
the
wicked
witch
of
the
west
illustration
after
some
time
and
not
less
than
three
failed
attempts
to
construct
a
figure
of
the
old
witch
sir
simon
sighed
it
was
hard
to
make
her
look
right
because
of
his
kind
and
gentle
nature
simon
images
always
wound
up
looking
too
friendly
this
was
not
the
right
image
for
the
wicked
witch
at
all
she
had
to
look
mean
and
hateful
she
had
to
look
like
the
kind
of
person
who
would
happily
have
the
tin
woodman
and
the
scarecrow
destroyed
or
take
an
innocent
little
girl
as
her
slave
without
remorse
at
last
he
decided
he
had
to
do
it
with
his
eyes
closed
this
way
he
would
not
be
as
repulsed
by
the
witch
cruelty
shutting
his
rodentine
eyes
sir
simon
painted
the
most
horrible
face
he
could
after
he
opened
his
eyes
to
look
at
his
handiwork
he
found
himself
feeling
quite
queasy
he
had
to
turn
away
to
avoid
being
sick
perfect
he
muttered
it
looks
just
like
her
illustration
he
then
set
up
the
float
and
hinged
the
arms
of
the
dorothy
figure
in
such
a
way
that
she
could
dump
a
bucket
over
the
witch
head
giving
three
cheers
for
creativity
he
had
constructed
the
witch
out
of
balloons
and
covered
them
with
brown
sugar
he
had
then
pushed
a
pin
into
the
figure
to
produce
a
hollow
sugar
figure
that
would
dissolve
instantly
when
touched
by
the
water
this
would
be
the
highlight
of
the
whole
parade
simon
was
very
proud
of
himself
he
pushed
his
magnificent
float
into
a
large
storage
locker
behind
the
palace
the
room
was
dusty
and
cobwebby
enough
to
assure
him
that
it
was
not
used
very
often
and
that
his
surprise
would
not
be
discovered
before
the
day
of
the
parade
now
i
need
to
find
a
bucket
and
fill
it
with
water
he
said
looking
around
the
room
he
noticed
an
oak
bucket
that
was
already
full
and
which
was
just
the
right
size
for
his
sculpture
he
quickly
secured
it
in
place
in
the
papier
maché
dorothy
hands
if
this
does
get
a
lot
of
loud
cheers
from
the
crowd
nothing
will
he
rubbed
his
paws
with
glee
illustration
chapter
four
an
unfortunate
outcome
the
day
of
the
big
parade
came
swiftly
sir
simon
and
kabumpo
were
vastly
proud
of
the
surprise
they
were
about
to
spring
on
the
people
of
the
emerald
city
indeed
it
was
a
delightful
parade
the
fuzzy
yellow
wogglebugs
had
put
together
a
choral
group
that
sang
a
bouncing
tune
as
they
marched
at
the
head
of
the
parade
tinker
followed
them
with
an
electronic
float
that
tossed
candy
canes
out
of
its
windows
to
the
people
below
princess
saari
came
next
riding
atop
a
magnificent
float
that
seemed
to
radiate
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
she
was
followed
by
pegina
the
pegasus
who
flew
just
above
the
heads
of
two
mighty
dragons
trot
and
betsy
bobbin
had
put
together
a
kazoo
band
and
played
ease
on
down
the
road
as
they
marched
along
behind
the
dragons
the
elves
of
elfland
followed
having
constructed
a
float
that
resembled
egor
fantastic
funhouse
out
of
hundreds
of
carnations
a
gray
spotlight
shot
out
of
the
windows
at
certain
intervals
to
circle
around
the
funhouse
and
resemble
a
cyclone
no
one
knew
how
the
elves
had
managed
to
make
the
light
do
this
trick
but
it
was
an
elven
secret
so
no
one
asked
many
other
quaint
and
delightful
spectacles
were
there
to
be
seen
and
enjoyed
but
it
was
the
marvelous
dorothy
and
wicked
witch
sculpture
that
caught
the
attention
of
everyone
it
reminded
all
of
the
reason
for
the
annual
celebration
and
all
were
happy
to
recall
the
way
they
had
been
freed
from
the
heartless
whims
of
the
old
woman
at
the
end
of
the
parade
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
image
and
simon
signaled
to
kabumpo
to
let
go
of
the
spring
the
dorothy
statue
splashed
the
sugary
witch
right
on
her
head
unfortunately
the
bucket
had
not
been
filled
with
water
as
simon
had
assumed
it
was
actually
filled
with
some
fermented
sucopinesz
juice
that
a
family
of
wombats
had
hidden
there
for
consumption
after
the
parade
the
witch
image
began
to
shrink
and
fall
away
the
crowd
roared
and
laughed
at
the
sight
but
of
course
we
all
know
that
sucopinesz
juice
and
sugar
do
not
mix
well
a
series
of
tiny
explosions
began
to
appear
above
the
melted
witch
kabumpo
was
so
startled
that
he
did
not
see
how
close
he
was
getting
to
the
hungry
tiger
feeling
a
heavy
elephant
foot
on
his
striped
tail
the
tiger
jumped
eight
hundred
yards
ahead
he
landed
on
princess
saari
breaking
a
hole
in
the
top
of
her
float
into
which
they
both
fell
from
this
hole
emanated
a
radiant
green
light
the
light
ricocheted
off
of
the
glass
cat
tail
and
struck
the
gray
light
that
had
been
circling
the
elfland
float
now
it
is
commonly
known
among
oz
scholars
that
a
cyclone
is
created
when
hot
and
cold
air
meet
in
one
place
it
was
the
same
way
when
the
two
magical
types
of
light
collided
the
dizzying
green
light
splashed
at
the
gray
light
and
a
funnel
cloud
emerged
it
whirled
about
until
it
surrounded
the
popping
mass
of
sugared
juice
when
the
twister
had
subsided
thanks
to
the
magic
of
glinda
and
the
wizard
there
stood
a
hideous
woman
in
a
black
outfit
on
her
head
she
wore
a
black
pointed
hat
in
her
hand
was
a
broomstick
illustration
who
stuttered
dorothy
i
do
know
replied
ozma
she
looks
like
a
witch
but
not
like
any
of
the
witches
i
ever
known
about
i
am
the
wicked
witch
of
the
west
shouted
the
woman
in
a
maniacal
voice
she
does
look
like
the
one
i
remember
said
the
scarecrow
this
one
has
two
eyes
and
green
skin
she
must
be
an
impostor
i
am
not
an
impostor
bellowed
the
woman
but
said
an
elderly
winkie
who
remembered
the
original
witch
witch
allidap
had
a
patch
over
one
eye
and
did
not
dress
in
pure
black
this
is
not
her
at
all
i
am
too
me
i
just
feel
a
little
different
today
that
all
i
will
prove
to
you
that
i
am
allidap

chapter
five
the
best
laid
plans
it
should
be
understood
that
although
the
creature
was
really
little
more
than
an
unstable
produced
by
a
series
of
accidents
she
believed
that
she
was
indeed
the
wicked
witch
of
the
west
and
as
long
as
she
suffered
under
this
delusion
she
was
dangerous
to
all
of
the
witch
enemies
especially
dorothy
as
her
primary
memory
was
based
upon
the
scene
on
the
float
rather
than
any
history
before
or
after
the
event
depicted
thereon
she
was
angry
and
afraid
these
being
the
emotions
that
were
depicted
in
the
sculpture
and
these
emotions
as
we
all
know
can
lead
one
to
do
things
that
are
not
particularly
wholesome
now
it
was
not
too
many
seconds
before
the
false
witch
hopped
onto
her
broomstick
and
zoomed
away
from
the
jeering
crowd
she
was
a
creature
of
resentment
and
hate
so
she
did
not
feel
safe
in
that
environment
instead
she
determined
to
find
a
way
to
reach
her
goals
elsewhere
knowing
about
the
castle
where
the
real
witch
had
lived
she
hid
herself
there
to
get
her
bearings
because
she
was
not
really
witch
allidap
she
did
not
know
much
magic
but
because
of
the
magic
in
the
colored
lights
she
knew
just
enough
to
keep
her
from
realizing
the
truth
about
her
identity
her
appearance
was
quite
different
from
that
of
the
real
allidap
there
was
a
reason
for
this
however
it
seems
that
at
the
very
millisecond
of
her
being
brought
to
life
someone
who
believed
in
her
had
thought
about
her
and
that
someone
had
had
a
different
impression
of
her
it
was
a
silly
impression
created
not
so
much
by
the
book
as
by
a
movie
musical
that
was
televised
annually
so
that
was
the
way
the
thinker
imagined
her
to
look
because
of
this
he
had
projected
his
impression
onto
the
false
witch
it
also
created
a
number
of
allidap
memories
in
the
mind
of
the
and
it
also
caused
her
to
remember
the
thinker
a
little
boy
named
graham
he
had
been
thinking
about
the
original
book
but
visualized
the
witch
as
she
had
looked
in
the
movie
and
because
he
had
an
inordinate
amount
of
homework
to
do
he
was
also
feeling
quite
resentful
little
did
he
dream
that
this
combination
of
negative
emotions
and
vivid
imagination
would
bring
into
manifestation
a
very
unpleasant
creature
one
that
no
decent
young
person
should
ever
have
to
encounter
but
now
graham
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
wicked
witch
illustration
she
was
in
his
home
and
she
was
hardly
filled
with
joy
she
dragged
him
to
her
castle
and
laughed
at
his
utter
helplessness
you
just
afraid
of
what
i
might
do
to
you
she
said
look
at
you
you
shaking
in
your
boots
i
am
afraid
yes
said
graham
really
afraid
but
i
do
think
you
harm
me
after
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
oh
replied
the
witch
really
and
what
might
that
be
listen
carefully
said
graham
i
know
where
there
is
a
book
of
magic
spells
that
can
make
mincemeat
out
of
dorothy
and
the
scarecrow
and
those
guys
you
do
the
witch
said
skeptically
and
what
is
a
book
why
it
is
a
bunch
of
pieces
of
paper
stuck
together
at
one
side
and
that
has
words
printed
inside
of
it
oh
yes
said
the
witch
i
know
what
words
are
i
had
some
words
of
warning
printed
on
some
signposts
to
keep
away
strangers
and
i
once
wrote
dorothy
in
the
sky
but
my
memory
does
include
a
book
where
is
it
only
i
can
get
it
said
graham
realizing
that
he
now
had
a
perfect
way
out
of
the
dilemma
it
is
back
at
my
home
in
america
he
was
sure
that
he
could
break
away
from
her
once
he
was
back
home
but
not
to
be
outsmarted
clutching
the
boy
by
the
hand
the
witch
immediately
pulled
him
back
through
the
mirror
without
letting
him
free
from
her
grasp
where
is
this
book
she
said
angrily
then
seeing
math
book
on
the
table
she
felt
a
tinge
of
recognition
there
had
been
some
of
these
on
a
table
in
her
castle
when
she
had
demanded
that
dorothy
give
her
those
magic
shoes
so
these
were
called
books
is
this
the
one
she
asked
picking
up
his
math
book
with
her
free
hand
what
are
these
words
on
it
what
wrong
asked
graham
ca
you
see
do
your
eyes
work
i
do
not
know
these
words
said
the
witch
my
memory
has
become
clouded
on
some
things
i
know
the
words
dorothy
and
the
ones
i
had
on
my
signposts
but
these
are
unfamiliar
what
do
they
say
it
says
graham
lied
best
and
most
complete
book
of
witchcraft
ever
it
has
every
spell
ever
invented
in
it
would
you
like
to
have
it
if
you
go
away
i
give
it
to
you
i
take
it
but
i
need
a
reader
to
read
it
to
me
that
shall
be
you
my
little
fool
so
saying
she
took
him
back
through
the
mirror
sealing
off
the
opening
behind
them
forever
chapter
six
spellbound
once
back
on
the
other
side
of
the
mirror
and
in
her
own
domain
the
witch
could
not
wait
to
get
started
on
the
first
spell
after
all
who
could
resist
experimenting
with
spells
from
a
book
with
a
title
like
best
and
most
complete
book
of
witchcraft
ever
okay
you
little
squirt
she
snapped
read
me
the
first
spell
graham
knew
he
would
have
to
think
off
the
top
of
his
head
and
think
fast
if
he
was
to
come
up
with
something
plausible
the
minute
she
found
out
that
the
book
was
a
fake
he
would
be
dead
meat
that
was
for
sure
okay
well
let
see
the
first
spiel
i
mean
spell
is
to
turn
an
obnoxious
dial
or
socially
disadvantaged
countenance
into
a
reflection
of
infinite
beauty
i
have
the
faintest
idea
what
you
just
said
snapped
the
witch
with
obvious
annoyance
read
it
to
me
again
wait
that
wo
do
any
good
what
do
you
think
it
means
graham
knew
he
had
her
hooked
it
is
obviously
a
spell
that
will
transform
you
into
the
most
beautiful
creature
to
ever
walk
the
face
of
the
earth
oh
my
said
the
with
obvious
delight
well
let
get
started
what
are
you
waiting
for
graham
cleared
his
throat
and
began
to
read
from
the
book
a
slimy
little
pickle
rub
it
with
a
shiny
nickel
drop
it
in
a
witch
hat
add
seventeen
eggs
on
top
of
that
top
that
off
with
a
bowl
of
and
spittle
from
a
little
fellow
add
some
sour
cream
and
chives
and
honey
directly
from
the
illustration
add
one
pint
of
strawberry
jam
preferably
bought
from
knott
berry
farm
then
bend
thy
head
towards
thy
legs
and
press
said
hat
upon
thy
head
now
stand
and
then
induce
a
friend
to
pull
it
down
below
thy
crown
wait
at
least
a
take
off
the
hat
and
dust
with
flour
now
look
in
the
mirror
and
thou
shalt
see
none
more
lovelier
than
thee
oh
that
does
sound
absolutely
divine
cried
the
witch
quick
help
me
gather
the
materials
together
so
we
can
start
immediately
graham
could
hardly
contain
himself
with
the
thought
of
the
true
results
of
this
experiment
and
although
he
was
going
to
use
this
opportunity
to
escape
he
almost
wished
he
could
stay
to
see
the
whole
thing
through
he
congratulated
himself
on
his
ability
to
create
such
an
spell
and
for
having
the
presence
of
mind
to
suggest
the
lead
time
he
would
need
in
order
to
escape
from
the
castle
when
everything
was
ready
graham
followed
the
spell
to
the
letter
and
since
he
was
the
only
little
fellow
around
he
was
the
obvious
choice
to
provide
the
spittle
for
the
concoction
which
he
did
with
great
delight
as
soon
as
he
got
to
the
part
where
he
had
to
pull
the
witch
hat
down
over
her
head
he
said
i
keep
my
eye
on
the
clock
and
let
you
know
when
the
half
hour
is
up
with
that
he
jammed
the
hat
down
over
her
eyes
and
down
to
her
shoulders
and
then
made
a
beeline
for
the
window
chapter
seven
an
alien
presence
after
graham
had
escaped
from
the
castle
he
thought
about
the
witch
standing
there
for
a
full
and
thinking
how
beautiful
she
was
going
to
be
when
she
took
the
hat
off
and
looked
at
herself
in
her
mirror
he
laughed
out
loud
as
he
imagined
how
she
would
really
look
with
that
gooey
mess
all
over
her
hair
and
face
and
clothes
but
he
knew
that
once
the
reality
dawned
on
her
that
the
spell
was
a
fake
that
she
was
just
as
ugly
as
ever
and
that
he
had
escaped
she
would
be
absolutely
beside
herself
with
rage
the
boy
elation
began
to
change
to
fear
as
he
considered
the
possible
repercussions
of
his
actions
here
he
was
in
a
strange
yellow
land
with
no
idea
of
where
he
was
going
or
where
to
hide
he
had
been
traveling
through
a
wooded
area
which
for
now
offered
some
measure
of
security
since
he
would
be
hidden
from
aerial
surveillance
when
he
came
upon
a
clearing
actually
it
was
more
than
just
a
clearing
it
was
a
perfectly
round
grassy
clearing
about
fifty
feet
in
diameter
and
as
he
studied
the
dome
it
began
to
slowly
rise
exposing
a
round
house
with
windows
and
doors
and
a
roof
graham
stood
perfectly
still
waiting
to
see
if
anyone
came
out
when
it
was
obvious
that
no
one
was
coming
he
cautiously
walked
toward
the
house
to
see
if
he
could
see
through
the
window
suddenly
a
loud
voice
filled
the
air
warning
you
are
approaching
too
close
to
the
vehicle
please
step
back
at
this
point
graham
was
more
than
a
little
confused
he
knew
that
this
sort
of
proximity
alarm
system
was
favored
by
some
motor
vehicle
owners
back
home
but
the
device
seemed
very
out
of
place
in
oz
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
the
sound
was
emanating
from
a
house
not
a
car
at
that
moment
the
round
roof
slowly
started
to
spin
and
rose
about
four
feet
above
the
house
and
hovered
there
the
outside
walls
receded
back
into
the
ground
to
reveal
a
bright
shiny
spaceship
shimmering
in
the
sunlight
a
ramp
unfolded
to
reveal
two
equally
shimmering
space
beings
they
descended
or
rather
floated
down
the
ramp
and
stopped
less
than
three
feet
from
the
boy
they
were
not
very
tall
about
four
feet
in
height
and
they
were
dressed
in
spacesuits
that
closely
followed
the
contour
of
their
slender
bodies
they
had
quite
large
heads
which
were
somewhat
out
of
proportion
to
their
overall
physique
their
eyes
were
large
and
and
were
the
blackest
of
black
with
no
pupils
visible
he
sensed
an
intelligence
emanating
from
their
eyes
that
was
far
in
excess
of
ordinary
people
their
skin
was
of
a
dull
grayish
hue
no
color
at
all
illustration
graham
waited
for
them
to
speak
for
some
reason
he
was
totally
unafraid
one
of
them
raised
his
right
hand
in
greeting
he
spoke
without
moving
his
lips
at
least
graham
heard
the
words
clearly
inside
his
head
but
could
sense
no
outside
sound
greetings
young
friend
you
stumbled
upon
our
location
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
we
know
that
you
bear
us
no
ill
will
indeed
not
replied
graham
in
fact
i
am
honored
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
always
wanted
to
meet
a
space
person
well
replied
the
other
being
you
are
a
space
person
too
i
am
said
graham
incredulously
i
afraid
you
mistaken
i
am
from
earth
and
where
my
little
friend
do
you
think
earth
is
is
it
not
suspended
in
space
like
all
of
the
other
planets
and
does
it
not
make
a
complete
rotation
upon
its
axis
every
hours
minutes
and
four
point
seconds
and
at
a
speed
of
a
thousand
miles
per
hour
and
does
it
not
orbit
your
sun
every
three
hundred
and
days
and
six
hours
and
nine
minutes
and
nine
point
five
seconds
and
at
a
speed
of
about
twenty
miles
per
second
and
does
it
not
revolve
along
with
the
moon
around
a
common
center
of
gravity
and
move
with
the
entire
solar
system
through
your
local
star
system
at
thirteen
miles
per
second
and
does
not
your
local
star
system
move
within
the
milky
way
at
the
rate
of
two
hundred
miles
per
second
and
does
not
the
milky
way
drift
with
respect
to
the
remote
external
galaxies
at
the
rate
of
one
hundred
miles
per
second
and
in
all
different
directions
and
does
not
your
galaxy
itself
make
a
complete
rotation
about
an
axis
every
two
hundred
million
years
and
does
it
not
travel
through
space
with
over
a
hundred
billion
other
suns
of
its
galactic
family
not
to
mention
an
untold
number
of
other
planets
graham
nodded
meekly
i
knew
our
planet
was
in
space
i
just
know
all
the
details
well
continued
the
being
even
if
you
mortals
could
travel
at
the
speed
of
light
it
would
still
take
you
a
hundred
thousand
years
to
cross
your
galaxy
from
edge
to
edge
the
spaceman
motioned
toward
the
craft
however
our
ship
could
visit
the
andromeda
galaxy
which
is
about
two
million
one
hundred
thousand
light
years
from
earth
and
return
before
you
could
say
i
say
that
is
a
little
bit
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
we
could
not
afford
to
waste
two
million
years
actually
over
four
million
years
round
trip
we
never
get
anything
done
now
wait
just
a
minute
said
graham
you
ca
go
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
they
told
us
in
school
that
would
be
against
the
laws
of
physics
we
learned
long
ago
replied
the
spaceman
that
the
laws
of
physics
kept
us
very
tightly
bound
until
we
found
we
could
gain
dominion
over
those
laws
you
see
we
earned
that
right
over
a
long
period
of
time
dominion
over
physical
law
requires
a
certain
knowledge
of
science
beyond
the
physical
as
well
as
a
working
knowledge
of
the
spiritual
laws
the
two
must
work
hand
in
hand
for
example
your
scientists
are
working
strictly
from
a
physical
perspective
they
are
totally
unaware
that
the
atoms
the
building
blocks
of
matter
have
a
counterpart
of
a
higher
frequency
one
that
falls
outside
of
the
realm
of
what
you
would
term
physical
in
any
event
without
that
counterpart
the
physical
world
as
you
know
it
could
not
exist
now
i
want
to
demonstrate
to
you
the
practical
aspects
of
our
knowledge
our
spaceship
is
vibrating
at
the
atomic
rate
of
the
collective
atoms
that
comprise
the
material
makeup
of
said
ship
now
as
we
observe
the
ship
i
am
going
to
concentrate
on
this
counterpart
of
the
atom
that
your
scientists
might
refer
to
as
antimatter
or
antiparticle
these
antiparticles
are
what
we
would
call
the
pure
state
of
the
atom
you
might
say
they
are
the
inner
core
of
the
atom
you
might
even
say
that
they
are
the
very
soul
of
the
atom
since
they
furnish
the
power
that
maintains
the
motion
of
the
atom
in
any
event
this
is
the
medium
we
work
with
incidentally
if
you
could
observe
the
motion
of
this
counterpart
to
the
atom
you
would
see
that
it
is
in
constant
motion
as
it
conveys
its
power
to
the
atom
it
turns
incessantly
upon
its
own
axis
spinning
like
a
top
it
is
constantly
pulsating
gyrating
and
i
might
even
say
dancing
in
a
most
beautiful
manner
i
might
tell
you
at
this
point
that
the
name
we
give
to
this
wonderful
animating
force
is
quite
naturally
the
anim
now
i
am
going
to
concentrate
on
the
atomic
structure
of
our
ship
i
am
going
to
raise
the
rate
of
vibration
or
frequency
of
the
individual
atoms
to
the
higher
rate
of
the
anim
state
as
i
do
so
the
ship
will
no
longer
be
detected
by
your
circuits
to
your
limited
senses
it
will
be
completely
invisible
to
you
it
is
this
little
trick
that
plays
havoc
with
the
minds
of
your
fellow
mortals
that
occasionally
catch
a
glimpse
of
our
ships
in
your
skies
only
to
see
them
disappear
in
an
instant
now
as
i
continue
to
concentrate
i
am
projecting
the
ship
to
a
certain
coordinate
namely
a
specific
planetary
member
of
the
galaxy
andromeda
this
is
done
at
the
speed
of
thought
which
is
instantaneous
there
the
starship
vanished
in
less
than
a
blink
now
it
back
again
the
spaceman
announced
and
indeed
it
truly
was
well
what
do
you
think
of
course
graham
was
beside
himself
he
could
not
speak
wow
he
said
eventually
wow
naturally
continued
the
spaceman
i
had
to
lower
the
vibrations
again
to
it
into
your
reality
but
it
is
this
manner
of
transportation
that
enables
us
to
come
and
go
as
we
please
and
in
doing
so
somewhat
confuse
your
scientists
and
governmental
authorities
graham
smiled
illustration
speaking
of
your
scientists
added
the
other
alien
they
would
probably
be
very
interested
to
know
that
long
before
the
countless
solar
systems
were
brought
into
manifestation
in
reference
to
the
many
planets
stars
gaseous
bodies
and
so
forth
space
was
null
and
void
of
all
that
is
now
in
existence
the
theater
of
infinite
space
was
empty
the
actors
had
not
yet
made
their
appearance
everything
every
solitary
atom
and
that
includes
the
atoms
that
presently
constitute
your
body
and
mine
were
back
in
that
great
core
of
life
the
oneness
the
source
of
all
some
like
to
call
this
presence
god
it
is
however
a
presence
that
is
very
real
even
to
scientists
who
call
themselves
agnostics
if
it
were
possible
to
become
attuned
to
this
presence
this
core
of
life
you
would
be
aware
of
pulsating
with
it
you
would
realize
that
you
are
receiving
a
great
force
which
enables
you
to
move
about
in
your
physical
body
this
force
is
constantly
nourishing
every
atom
that
is
out
there
in
space
every
atom
within
the
earth
it
is
the
great
unifying
force
that
your
scientists
suspect
must
exist
but
have
never
quite
been
able
to
get
a
handle
on
however
they
are
getting
closer
to
it
with
the
discovery
of
dark
matter
but
to
continue
the
core
of
life
may
be
pictured
as
a
great
sun
and
yet
this
would
not
describe
it
for
it
is
larger
than
any
sun
could
ever
possibly
be
and
if
we
were
to
try
to
measure
it
and
there
would
be
no
way
to
do
this
we
would
find
that
it
would
encircle
not
only
one
solar
system
but
many
other
solar
systems
beyond
however
i
am
digressing
from
my
story
of
the
creation
of
the
universe
gradually
or
suddenly
depending
on
your
viewpoint
in
the
great
consciousness
of
time
the
animatical
forces
from
the
core
of
life
caused
the
great
expansion
from
the
etheric
state
of
matter
causing
gross
material
to
manifest
through
friction
and
be
slushed
off
and
begin
to
solidify
and
when
it
did
the
planets
began
to
form
first
one
began
to
form
over
here
and
then
another
one
began
to
form
over
there
and
these
in
turn
were
followed
by
still
others
until
gradually
within
the
great
power
that
is
concentrated
at
the
point
where
the
planets
were
revolving
a
great
solar
system
came
into
manifestation
then
after
their
birth
the
planets
were
dormant
for
what
may
have
been
many
millions
of
years
while
they
were
going
through
the
cooling
process
then
gradually
over
perhaps
many
million
more
years
the
germinal
kingdom
brought
forth
the
different
forms
of
matter
bacteria
et
cetera
these
in
turn
brought
forth
the
various
bodies
the
animalistic
kingdom
and
other
forms
of
life
that
would
be
needed
to
help
build
and
prepare
the
way
and
become
an
assisting
force
in
eventually
bringing
forth
the
human
expression
so
you
see
it
was
all
carefully
orchestrated
by
that
driving
presence
i
mentioned
we
are
now
living
in
the
seventh
group
of
planets
yes
the
universe
as
you
know
it
existed
in
six
previous
manifestations
returning
each
time
to
its
original
state
this
seventh
manifestation
is
the
last
the
time
will
come
when
there
will
be
no
physical
planets
no
physical
remnants
of
this
present
universe
but
not
to
worry
my
little
friend
you
and
i
and
indeed
all
expressions
of
what
you
might
refer
to
as
life
will
continue
on
for
life
is
eternal
it
has
always
existed
and
it
always
will
exist
the
physical
expression
is
only
a
temporary
condition
by
the
way
in
our
haste
we
forgot
to
introduce
ourselves
my
name
is
agasha
and
my
brother
here
is
araskus
your
world
will
no
doubt
be
reading
more
about
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
we
speak
i
am
receiving
a
telepathic
message
from
a
william
eisen
who
now
resides
in
oz
he
reminds
me
that
while
in
america
he
brought
forth
some
of
my
philosophy
in
written
documents
entitled
master
of
and
agashan
these
works
were
written
for
adults
but
older
children
who
have
an
advanced
understanding
may
appreciate
them
too
eisen
was
a
personal
friend
of
evans
who
at
this
moment
is
recording
these
very
events
as
they
occur
illustration
the
two
beings
then
shook
hands
with
the
boy
and
bid
him
farewell
as
they
returned
to
their
ship
moments
later
the
craft
arose
and
tilted
in
salute
as
it
spun
away
beyond
the
horizon
graham
stood
for
the
longest
time
staring
at
the
spot
where
the
spaceship
had
disappeared
from
sight
there
were
so
many
more
questions
he
wanted
to
ask
and
he
wondered
if
he
would
ever
again
have
the
opportunity
one
question
he
meant
to
ask
was
that
if
it
took
two
million
three
hundred
thousand
some
years
for
light
to
reach
earth
from
the
andromeda
galaxy
would
that
mean
that
we
would
be
observing
it
as
it
existed
two
point
three
million
years
ago
and
that
if
it
suddenly
disappeared
at
this
moment
in
our
time
would
we
not
know
it
for
another
two
point
three
million
years
that
seemed
like
a
very
good
question
to
ask
for
it
would
mean
that
when
we
look
out
into
space
we
are
really
looking
back
into
time
now
that
he
thought
of
it
his
science
teacher
had
said
that
it
takes
eight
minutes
for
light
to
reach
us
from
the
sun
so
if
the
sun
disappeared
three
minutes
ago
we
would
not
know
it
for
another
five
minutes
what
a
thought
graham
realized
that
not
a
solitary
soul
back
home
would
ever
believe
one
word
of
his
communication
with
the
space
people
assuming
that
is
that
he
would
ever
be
foolish
enough
to
try
to
tell
anyone
but
the
first
thing
he
would
try
to
do
would
be
to
find
the
books
agasha
had
mentioned
he
would
do
this
the
minute
he
got
home
home
oh
my
gosh
how
long
had
he
been
gone
and
how
was
he
going
to
get
back
why
oh
why
had
he
not
tried
to
hitch
a
ride
with
the
space
people
chapter
eight
a
strange
encounter
graham
mentally
kicked
himself
for
not
thinking
of
asking
the
ufo
people
for
a
ride
back
to
america
he
had
felt
so
much
in
awe
of
the
magnificent
spaceship
and
its
unique
occupants
though
that
it
had
never
entered
his
mind
to
ask
a
selfish
favor
of
them
he
now
regretted
that
feeling
after
all
the
two
aliens
had
made
it
obvious
that
they
meant
to
serve
him
and
help
him
to
learn
surely
they
would
never
have
considered
it
a
selfish
request
on
graham
part
had
he
simply
asked
that
they
drop
him
off
in
america
on
their
way
to
wherever
they
might
have
been
headed
but
it
was
alas
a
little
bit
too
late
to
cry
over
spilled
milk
instead
graham
had
far
more
important
matters
to
attend
to
he
had
after
all
come
into
a
very
strange
land
where
the
physical
laws
he
was
used
to
no
longer
seemed
to
apply
not
only
that
but
his
presence
would
be
missed
before
too
long
and
he
did
not
want
to
cause
undue
worry
back
home
but
even
more
immediate
he
had
a
powerful
and
very
wicked
witch
to
deal
with
who
would
soon
catch
on
to
his
lies
and
she
was
not
going
to
be
at
all
happy
with
him
had
graham
been
a
lesser
boy
he
might
have
broken
down
and
cried
but
graham
decided
instead
to
make
the
most
of
the
grave
situation
he
continued
to
walk
past
the
area
where
the
ufolanders
had
been
his
main
concern
now
was
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
awful
old
witch
castle
he
was
wondering
in
which
specific
direction
to
go
when
he
heard
a
noise
in
the
trees
at
first
he
could
not
identify
the
sound
although
it
was
a
familiar
sound
because
it
was
so
far
out
of
place
in
oz
it
did
not
register
at
first
but
yes
now
he
was
certain
it
was
the
sound
of
a
television
set
that
is
to
say
the
sound
of
human
voices
that
could
only
be
coming
from
a
radio
or
tv
it
is
a
sound
you
simply
can
not
mistake
now
the
sound
was
getting
louder
it
was
coming
toward
him
on
earth
could
a
television
set
be
doing
graham
thought
and
how
could
it
be
moving
toward
him
the
answer
immediately
became
known
when
out
from
a
clump
of
trees
walked
a
robotic
looking
creature
he
had
triangular
shaped
legs
and
arms
and
body
in
place
of
a
face
he
had
a
portable
television
set
not
only
that
but
the
channels
kept
changing
first
channel
two
with
the
evening
news
then
channel
four
with
a
basketball
game
then
channel
seven
with
then
channel
eleven
with
a
program
about
ufos
then
channel
thirteen
with
a
commercial
for
head
and
shoulders
shampoo
and
so
on
and
so
on
well
this
was
the
strangest
sight
to
behold
a
walking
television
set
it
walked
right
up
to
graham
and
stopped
right
up
against
his
face
then
the
screen
went
blank
for
a
moment
and
a
face
appeared
that
is
to
say
not
a
human
face
exactly
but
sort
of
a
cartoon
type
of
face
with
large
bushy
eyebrows
big
expressive
eyes
a
prominent
nose
and
a
mouth
in
the
shape
of
a
big
grin
howdy
doody
said
the
mouth
as
the
thing
hand
shot
out
and
grabbed
graham
hand
in
a
vigorous
handshake
how
how
how
stammered
graham
illustration
howhowhow
inquired
the
voice
that
a
funny
word
i
never
heard
it
before
ah
eh
said
graham
his
voice
still
a
bit
shaky
i
was
actually
trying
to
say
do
you
do
oh
i
see
replied
the
being
but
how
do
i
do
what
no
i
mean
i
trying
to
say
er
doody
to
you
oh
now
i
understand
i
sorry
for
being
so
dumb
but
you
see
my
entire
vocabulary
comes
from
tv
shows
i
never
actually
went
to
school
so
some
things
i
do
not
know
i
beg
of
you
forgive
me
he
shouted
as
he
bent
down
on
one
knee
and
held
graham
hand
there
no
need
to
be
so
dramatic
said
graham
i
forgive
you
oh
thanks
a
bunch
the
creature
said
is
there
anything
you
like
to
watch
you
can
watch
any
television
show
that
ever
been
recorded
in
television
history
just
say
the
word
well
nothing
right
now
graham
answered
but
i
really
curious
as
to
how
you
came
into
being
how
i
came
into
being
hmmmmm
oh
you
mean
how
i
was
manufactured
well
originally
a
tinsmith
made
me
but
then
i
lost
my
head
over
a
girl
then
one
day
an
electrical
genius
from
mars
came
to
oz
to
discuss
a
contract
to
build
satellite
dishes
they
wanted
to
bounce
signals
from
mars
to
earth
in
order
to
relay
martian
soap
operas
in
exchange
for
some
earth
programming
to
mars
their
favorite
earth
programs
are
reruns
of
and
and
they
even
more
popular
than
their
blockbuster
favorite
anyway
as
i
was
saying
let
see
i
had
lost
my
head
and
now
wait
a
minute
graham
interrupted
there
are
no
people
on
mars
besides
the
environment
there
is
too
hostile
to
support
life
oh
you
mean
that
they
have
too
many
harsh
tv
critics
no
i
mean
that
for
one
thing
the
temperature
would
be
too
harsh
it
way
too
cold
on
mars
to
support
life
not
to
mention
the
atmosphere
which
is
mostly
carbon
dioxide
oh
my
dear
boy
smiled
the
face
you
do
know
anything
do
you
oh
you
know
your
scientific
facts
all
right
but
according
to
my
memory
banks
there
is
life
all
over
the
universe
that
your
scientists
crude
observation
methods
can
not
even
detect
you
beginning
to
sound
like
the
ufo
people
i
talked
to
graham
answered
with
a
tone
of
disapproval
in
his
voice
well
nevertheless
life
exists
simultaneously
on
many
different
frequency
levels
that
are
undetectable
from
one
to
the
other
an
analogy
would
be
the
many
tv
channels
that
are
in
the
air
simultaneously
but
you
can
only
tune
in
to
the
one
frequency
that
your
tuning
device
is
locked
into
well
i
heard
that
before
answered
graham
yes
and
people
are
tuning
devices
in
themselves
that
why
some
people
are
sensitive
to
the
vibrations
from
oz
and
can
see
what
is
going
on
there
baum
was
the
first
person
in
america
who
was
able
to
tune
into
oz
and
he
wrote
many
history
books
on
this
land
well
that
is
to
say
they
were
recordings
of
current
events
at
the
time
he
wrote
them
but
they
are
now
history
and
as
much
as
he
wrote
he
was
only
able
to
record
a
tiny
fraction
of
our
history
since
then
many
people
have
contributed
some
more
than
others
i
wonder
why
no
one
in
america
was
able
to
tune
into
oz
before
frank
baum
graham
said
because
there
are
millions
of
frequencies
but
he
happened
to
hit
the
right
one
one
day
when
he
was
telling
stories
to
the
children
he
was
very
lucky
to
hit
it
because
of
the
tremendous
odds
against
him
but
once
he
did
it
was
easy
after
that
and
it
was
easy
for
other
people
to
follow
him
because
they
knew
it
could
be
done
and
kept
persevering
until
they
were
able
to
tune
in
themselves
the
secret
is
not
to
give
up
if
you
are
truly
interested
because
once
you
lock
into
it
you
become
better
attuned
as
time
goes
by
i
heard
a
good
example
of
this
sort
of
thing
on
my
sports
channel
just
the
other
day
they
were
discussing
roger
bannister
and
how
he
broke
the
four
minute
mile
in
and
that
no
one
in
earth
history
up
until
that
time
believed
it
could
be
done
so
no
one
did
it
but
once
bannister
ran
the
mile
in
three
minutes
and
point
four
seconds
other
people
broke
the
record
because
now
they
knew
it
was
possible
after
all
they
had
never
really
tried
hard
enough
before
that
because
they
simply
did
not
believe
this
just
shows
that
you
can
do
anything
you
set
your
mind
to
do
as
long
as
you
believe
it
possible
let
me
recite
a
poem
i
heard
once
on
my
public
television
channel
this
poem
if
my
memory
banks
serve
me
right
is
by
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
longenecker
you
think
you
are
beaten
you
are
if
you
like
to
win
but
think
you
ca
its
almost
a
cinch
you
if
you
think
you
lose
you
lost
for
out
in
the
world
we
find
success
begins
with
a
fellow
will
it
all
in
the
state
of
wind
if
you
think
you
are
outclassed
you
are
you
got
to
think
high
to
rise
you
can
ever
win
a
prize
life
battles
do
always
go
to
the
stronger
or
faster
man
but
sooner
or
later
the
man
who
wins
is
the
one
who
thinks
he
illustration
that
very
inspirational
said
graham
i
must
remember
that
but
does
it
apply
equally
to
girls
oh
of
course
the
tv
responded
but
the
poem
was
written
a
long
time
ago
before
gender
language
was
in
vogue
you
seem
rather
wise
for
a
manufactured
person
said
graham
where
did
your
brain
come
from
oh
i
have
really
got
a
brain
in
the
traditional
sense
of
the
word
my
brain
is
largely
electronic
and
preprogrammed
from
a
lot
of
things
i
seen
and
heard
on
tv
there
are
lessons
to
be
learned
even
from
the
poorest
of
shows
do
you
have
a
name
asked
graham
well
most
of
my
friends
call
me
telle
my
full
name
is
telle
visionary
but
you
can
just
call
me
telly
illustration
chapter
nine
captured
again
well
telly
you
are
a
most
fascinating
person
would
you
like
to
accompany
me
on
my
mission
you
see
i
am
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
and
i
feel
a
lot
better
with
someone
like
yourself
who
is
familiar
with
the
way
things
work
here
also
i
have
the
slightest
idea
where
i
am
or
where
i
going
not
only
that
but
i
escaped
from
a
wicked
witch
and
she
probably
mad
as
heck
right
now
and
looking
for
me
i
be
delighted
to
accompany
you
my
little
friend
although
i
must
tell
you
i
do
know
how
much
protection
i
could
give
you
from
the
wicked
witch
because
if
it
the
one
i
think
it
is
she
bullied
me
from
time
to
time
whenever
she
sees
me
she
zooms
right
in
and
makes
me
run
all
the
soap
operas
she
missed
sometimes
i
have
to
sit
for
hours
and
hours
while
she
catches
up
by
the
way
what
is
the
mission
you
mentioned
oh
my
mission
is
to
get
home
to
america
graham
answered
quickly
my
parents
must
be
worried
sick
about
me
have
you
any
ideas
how
i
could
get
back
before
that
witch
captures
me
again
well
let
see
hmmm
dum
de
dum
de
dum
hmmm
um
let
me
think
there
was
a
long
pause
no
he
finally
said
i
ca
think
of
a
single
way
you
could
get
back
to
america
in
fact
i
really
do
think
it
even
possible
for
a
human
being
to
get
back
once
he
here
the
only
person
i
know
of
who
ever
did
that
was
dorothy
gale
of
kansas
and
the
reason
i
know
that
is
that
i
run
the
movie
every
year
and
the
end
is
always
the
same
dorothy
clicks
her
heels
together
three
times
and
says
no
place
like
home
there
no
place
like
home
et
cetera
and
she
wakes
up
in
her
bed
back
in
kansas
now
there
an
idea
how
about
we
go
and
see
dorothy
she
know
how
to
get
you
back
why
did
i
think
of
that
first
wonderful
the
boy
exclaimed
i
beginning
to
feel
a
lot
better
what
is
dorothy
doing
now
is
she
graham
question
was
cut
short
by
a
big
extremely
loud
popping
sound
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
when
the
smoke
cleared
who
should
be
there
but
the
wicked
witch
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
and
prancing
up
and
down
with
excitement
well
my
little
friend
found
you
at
last
have
i
loved
your
spell
oh
it
was
terrific
see
how
beautiful
i
look
do
you
do
you
she
screamed
grabbing
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
look
at
me
look
i
say
she
yelled
as
she
jerked
his
face
to
hers
do
i
look
more
beautiful
to
you
let
see
what
was
the
last
line
of
that
spell
oh
now
i
remember
look
in
the
mirror
and
you
shall
see
none
more
beautiful
than
thee
you
little
liar
liar
did
you
hear
me
how
could
i
not
asked
graham
the
way
you
carrying
on
i
assume
there
are
people
in
kansas
who
can
hear
you
but
he
cowered
behind
telly
as
he
said
so
hello
my
good
woman
said
telly
holding
out
one
of
his
peculiar
arms
his
handshake
was
not
accepted
by
the
wicked
woman
allow
me
to
say
that
you
are
more
exquisitely
beautiful
than
any
of
the
television
stars
i
ever
seen
or
heard
of
said
the
robotic
man
and
believe
you
me
i
have
run
more
miss
america
beauty
pageants
than
you
can
shake
a
stick
at
you
are
lovelier
than
any
of
those
girls
you
are
more
innocently
ravishing
than
ginger
grant
on
island
you
are
the
epitome
of
human
grace
and
style
you
make
all
other
women
pale
beside
you
huh
said
the
witch
dropping
graham
like
a
sack
of
potatoes
he
caught
his
breath
and
tried
to
stand
up
but
the
witch
had
put
one
of
her
big
long
feet
on
his
chest
to
hold
him
down
what
are
you
talking
about
the
witch
asked
of
the
i
am
just
admiring
your
gorgeousness
said
telly
in
a
musical
tone
of
voice
are
you
the
next
tv
the
next
susan
lucci
are
you
going
to
take
the
couch
potatoes
of
the
world
by
storm
and
make
all
of
them
yearn
to
be
you
you
could
you
know
you
surely
are
already
the
envy
of
everyone
who
has
ever
laid
eyes
upon
you
the
witch
looked
at
her
prisoner
what
is
this
machine
up
to
boy
and
you
best
not
lie
to
me
again
oh
no
replied
graham
i
have
learned
my
lesson
to
be
sure
i
would
think
of
telling
another
lie
then
what
is
this
clinking
clanking
clattering
collection
of
caliginous
junk
babbling
about
she
sneered
i
truly
relishing
your
magnificent
beauty
repeated
telly
my
friend
is
simply
admiring
your
beauty
like
he
said
answered
graham
not
sure
why
telly
was
acting
this
way
but
deciding
it
would
be
best
to
play
along
i
think
he
is
quite
smitten
with
you
really
said
the
witch
tell
me
more
you
are
truly
a
vision
of
loveliness
charmed
telly
in
a
most
dramatic
manner
my
heartstrings
are
all
going
zing
they
are
the
witch
said
somewhat
perplexed
maybe
the
spell
worked
after
all
i
guess
it
was
a
delayed
reaction
give
me
a
mirror
i
want
to
see
how
i
look
er
you
do
want
to
do
that
said
graham
you
er
you
are
so
gorgeous
that
no
mirror
could
possibly
capture
your
true
image
that
altogether
silly
and
utterly
foolish
young
man
now
that
i
am
pretty
i
want
to
look
upon
myself
the
witch
took
her
foot
off
his
chest
and
let
him
stand
up
now
fetch
me
a
mirror
or
i
will
turn
mean
such
beauty
could
never
do
harm
to
anyone
said
telly
you
are
only
meant
to
be
worshipped
thank
you
the
witch
said
then
realizing
that
she
had
actually
said
something
polite
she
added
you
bizarre
jumble
of
soup
cans
and
gigabytes
she
saw
that
graham
had
made
no
move
to
obtain
a
mirror
so
she
pushed
him
over
again
okay
i
get
my
own
mirror
she
switched
off
telly
picture
in
order
to
catch
her
reflection
in
the
blank
screen
telly
thinking
quickly
distracted
her
for
a
moment
and
switched
the
screen
back
on
while
at
the
same
time
calling
up
an
image
of
eva
gabor
from
his
archives
illustration
when
graham
saw
what
had
happened
he
held
his
teeth
tightly
together
and
clenched
his
fists
in
anxiety
how
would
the
crone
react
my
my
my
goodness
she
said
i
really
am
something
i
she
smiled
a
hideous
grin
just
looky
there
i
am
beautiful
graham
anxiety
quickly
subsided
telly
clever
ploy
had
worked
you
are
a
vision
of
loveliness
said
the
boy
i
am
are
i
i
gorgeous
she
then
began
to
dance
and
flitted
around
like
a
young
girl
as
she
broke
into
a
rendering
of
a
song
from
the
musical
play
side
feel
pretty
oh
so
pretty
i
feel
pretty
and
witty
and
gay
and
i
pity
any
girl
who
is
me
today
i
feel
charming
oh
so
charming
it
alarming
how
charming
i
feel
and
so
pretty
that
i
hardly
can
believe
i
real
after
she
finished
the
song
she
closed
her
eyes
in
sheer
ecstasy
and
heaved
a
long
contented
sigh
she
stood
there
like
that
for
the
longest
time
graham
and
telly
quickly
seized
the
moment
and
tiptoed
behind
a
hedgerow
and
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
earshot
they
ran
like
the
wind
as
far
as
they
could
go
as
soon
as
they
felt
they
were
safe
they
collapsed
in
a
heap
in
uncontrollable
laughter
chapter
ten
a
mystical
experience
it
had
been
quite
some
time
since
escaping
from
the
witch
again
and
the
two
friends
walked
along
the
road
lost
in
thought
well
that
is
to
say
graham
was
lost
in
thought
whereas
telly
was
playing
an
old
commercial
your
pleasure
double
your
fun
get
double
rolled
into
one
oh
double
your
pleasure
double
your
fun
with
double
good
double
good
suddenly
the
pair
came
across
a
sign
at
the
side
of
the
road
which
read
international
airport
departures
upper
level
arrivals
lower
level
follow
the
blue
signs
for
the
upper
level
follow
the
red
signs
for
the
lower
telly
cried
graham
telly
i
ca
believe
it
an
airport
in
oz
why
did
you
tell
me
now
i
can
go
home
all
i
have
to
do
is
buy
a
ticket
they
can
call
my
dad
and
get
his
credit
card
number
now
wait
a
minute
telly
exclaimed
not
so
fast
my
young
friend
there
is
no
airport
in
oz
never
was
and
never
will
be
it
just
not
possible
for
airplanes
to
fly
here
from
anywhere
queen
ozma
herself
saw
to
that
after
a
certain
incident
with
a
little
girl
and
a
pet
monkey
no
this
can
not
be
for
real
must
be
some
kind
of
trick
graham
was
crestfallen
he
was
just
not
prepared
to
accept
such
a
dismal
opinion
oh
no
i
sure
you
mistaken
they
would
have
a
sign
like
that
if
there
was
no
airport
there
well
i
hate
to
say
i
told
you
so
but
you
see
when
we
get
there
that
there
nothing
there
telly
said
emphatically
at
least
not
an
airport
he
suddenly
stopped
in
his
tracks
i
ca
believe
what
i
seeing
he
shouted
incredulously
as
the
sight
of
a
huge
airport
the
size
of
international
loomed
up
ahead
see
i
told
you
so
shouted
graham
with
obvious
delight
as
he
ran
forward
home
sweet
home
here
i
come
not
so
fast
warned
telly
not
so
fast
it
has
to
be
a
trick
maybe
the
wicked
witch
has
created
an
illusion
and
and
it
really
her
castle
but
graham
was
already
out
of
earshot
before
him
loomed
a
giant
glistening
in
the
sun
its
huge
jet
engines
screaming
with
impatience
for
full
power
to
be
applied
and
the
passenger
door
was
open
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
with
a
smiling
flight
attendant
beckoning
graham
aboard
hurry
up
she
called
we
ready
to
take
off
and
you
running
late
graham
scurried
up
the
stairs
as
fast
as
his
little
legs
would
carry
him
the
flight
attendant
checked
his
name
off
a
list
and
the
door
closed
quickly
leaving
graham
with
no
time
to
say
goodbye
to
telly
who
was
at
that
moment
looking
up
at
the
plane
forlornly
as
it
taxied
forward
toward
the
runway
meanwhile
graham
was
being
bundled
into
his
seat
and
buckled
into
his
seatbelt
by
the
pretty
flight
attendant
it
was
only
then
that
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
purchased
a
ticket
nor
had
he
had
a
chance
to
say
goodbye
to
telly
he
was
seated
alone
by
the
window
and
quickly
looked
out
to
see
if
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
friend
but
it
was
too
late
the
plane
was
already
at
the
end
of
the
runway
and
several
feet
into
the
air
with
the
countryside
whizzing
past
and
getting
smaller
and
smaller
as
the
plane
quickly
ascended
the
captain
voice
came
over
the
intercom
loud
and
clear
good
morning
ladies
and
gentlemen
this
is
your
captain
speaking
we
have
departed
oz
international
airport
and
will
be
cruising
at
twenty
thousand
feet
we
should
be
arriving
at
our
destination
in
about
three
hours
you
may
remove
your
seatbelts
and
make
yourselves
comfortable
refreshments
will
be
served
shortly
and
you
may
watch
our
movie
if
you
wish
graham
looked
around
to
see
who
else
was
sharing
his
flight
he
was
astonished
to
see
that
there
were
no
other
passengers
at
all
now
he
began
to
get
frightened
why
would
a
great
big
airplane
take
off
with
no
passengers
except
himself
and
who
was
that
captain
addressing
when
he
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
had
been
caught
up
in
an
episode
of
telly
just
then
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
portly
gentleman
approaching
him
from
the
front
of
the
plane
he
assumed
there
was
another
passenger
after
all
one
who
must
have
been
sitting
in
the
front
seat
and
too
low
for
his
head
to
be
visible
however
as
the
gentleman
approached
closer
to
where
graham
was
seated
the
boy
became
even
more
perplexed
the
gentleman
in
question
was
none
other
than
william
shakespeare
oh
there
was
no
mistaking
such
an
historical
figure
graham
had
seen
paintings
and
drawings
of
him
many
times
and
his
clothes
and
features
were
an
exact
replica
of
those
portrayals
not
only
that
but
he
was
carrying
a
great
big
book
entitled
complete
works
of
william
suddenly
graham
flushed
with
embarrassment
how
could
he
think
for
one
moment
that
this
was
william
shakespeare
the
fellow
was
obviously
an
actor
perhaps
on
his
way
home
from
making
a
movie
and
so
late
for
his
flight
that
he
did
not
have
time
to
change
his
clothes
or
remove
his
makeup
at
that
moment
the
gentleman
spoke
good
day
my
dear
fellow
my
name
is
william
shakespeare
do
you
mind
if
i
sit
here
the
plane
rather
crowded
and
i
see
that
you
have
the
whole
aisle
to
yourself
illustration
okay
that
it
thought
graham
the
guy
a
definite
nut
case
must
have
escaped
from
the
looney
bin
and
somehow
got
to
oz
the
crowded
indeed
he
and
i
are
the
only
passengers
every
single
seat
is
empty
however
shakespeare
seated
himself
next
to
graham
without
waiting
for
a
reply
i
know
that
you
do
believe
i
who
i
say
i
am
he
said
but
i
can
assure
you
i
am
he
who
is
often
referred
to
as
the
bard
of
avon
all
i
like
you
to
do
is
to
tell
earth
disbelievers
who
do
accept
that
i
wrote
my
works
that
i
did
indeed
write
them
without
waiting
for
graham
to
respond
he
then
proceeded
to
break
into
verse
in
a
gentle
melodic
voice
am
he
who
wrote
my
verse
my
dramas
sonnets
quibbles
rhyme
i
shakespeare
still
dear
england
bard
and
shall
ever
be
throughout
time
i
wrote
is
true
some
sonnets
plays
to
make
a
living
pass
the
time
in
merriment
or
jest
and
glee
i
turned
out
many
a
ribaled
rhyme
to
set
the
world
right
and
make
snivelers
agree
as
to
who
wrote
shakespeare
if
bacon
or
he
or
marlowe
or
pitt
or
scribes
ages
old
i
say
to
them
all
the
truth
is
now
told
when
a
man
among
kings
i
was
knighted
by
one
where
a
handle
or
wheel
makes
a
favorite
son
distinguished
through
time
for
something
he
done
for
a
knight
in
his
day
must
his
laurels
have
won
with
a
band
of
king
players
by
bill
shakespeare
led
i
played
many
roles
recalled
the
dead
to
piece
out
my
plot
or
to
string
out
my
rhyme
nor
considered
it
theft
more
an
honor
that
time
to
borrow
a
plot
for
a
queen
or
a
king
and
watch
their
amuse
as
my
poor
muse
would
sing
so
each
time
i
needed
a
plot
or
a
play
i
searched
the
tomes
where
musty
plots
lay
bulging
out
with
ideas
from
craniums
dust
whose
shades
may
have
helped
as
i
now
know
and
trust
but
that
any
one
man
made
a
plot
or
a
play
or
was
such
singled
out
as
a
ruse
for
my
pay
i
deny
in
in
spirit
this
day
should
any
man
play
be
found
in
my
work
which
was
not
by
me
writ
is
a
publisher
quirk
which
one
day
i
acclaim
for
i
mean
to
read
all
as
signed
with
my
young
graham
was
beyond
words
at
this
outpouring
of
verse
the
mode
of
language
was
not
something
he
could
identify
with
in
his
everyday
world
and
it
was
quite
beyond
his
level
of
comprehension
but
he
sensed
this
was
no
ordinary
man
in
his
presence
are
you
really
william
shakespeare
he
ventured
forth
timidly
and
if
you
truly
are
how
could
you
still
be
alive
hundreds
of
years
after
you
were
born
well
young
one
smiled
the
bard
kindly
that
is
a
long
story
suffice
to
say
i
am
here
with
you
having
this
conversation
and
look
around
you
many
of
the
other
passengers
are
people
from
your
history
books
we
are
en
route
to
our
home
beyond
the
outer
fringes
of
oz
we
are
graduates
of
the
university
of
higher
consciousness
and
we
are
on
our
way
to
historicalfigureland
so
much
hatred
exists
in
the
world
you
come
from
and
where
there
is
not
exactly
hatred
per
se
there
is
often
indifference
or
even
total
apathy
for
the
plight
of
others
and
as
if
your
world
were
not
bad
enough
with
the
constant
warring
between
nations
many
individuals
in
civilized
lands
feel
the
need
to
declare
war
on
their
neighbors
i
am
speaking
of
your
young
people
killing
each
other
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
has
become
the
thing
to
do
what
is
so
sad
is
that
they
totally
lack
remorse
for
their
victims
pain
and
suffering
and
give
not
the
slightest
thought
to
the
victims
families
left
behind
in
utter
and
complete
desolation
and
sadness
at
their
terrible
loss
our
goal
is
to
find
a
way
to
encourage
people
to
reach
out
to
one
another
to
care
for
one
another
that
is
why
we
wrote
our
books
and
plays
to
teach
people
what
life
be
truly
about
that
thought
graham
no
doubt
about
the
truth
of
what
the
old
guy
is
saying
regarding
earth
conditions
but
the
queer
old
boy
is
definitely
off
his
rocker
first
there
definitely
no
other
passengers
on
the
plane
good
grief
he
exclaimed
as
the
outlines
of
human
forms
began
to
appear
in
the
other
passenger
seats
gradually
these
forms
became
more
solid
until
he
realized
that
indeed
the
plane
was
filled
with
passengers
many
of
which
were
historical
figures
in
the
modes
of
dress
of
their
particular
times
in
history
first
he
saw
napoleon
in
the
aisle
to
his
immediate
left
then
next
to
him
marie
antoinette
then
mary
henry
the
eighth
and
alexander
the
great
in
the
next
aisle
caesar
augustus
mark
anthony
cleopatra
joan
of
arc
aristotle
and
plato
it
seemed
that
every
historical
figure
of
note
was
present
aboard
the
plane
not
to
mention
a
sprinkling
of
people
from
various
walks
of
life
such
as
marcus
aurelius
jane
merrick
kenneth
gage
baum
fred
stone
judy
garland
and
ray
powell
of
course
graham
did
not
know
who
everyone
was
by
name
but
many
faces
looked
familiar
to
him
i
terribly
sorry
apologized
shakespeare
i
did
realize
that
your
eyes
had
not
yet
become
sensitized
to
the
higher
vibrations
of
my
friends
what
must
you
have
thought
of
me
oh
nothing
at
all
cried
graham
i
mean
i
had
really
noticed
all
these
people
i
was
so
engrossed
in
what
you
were
saying
really
replied
the
bard
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
quite
understand
people
are
always
totally
captivated
by
my
words
anyway
as
i
was
saying
or
rather
as
i
was
about
to
say
at
that
moment
a
head
bent
over
the
bard
shoulder
to
say
hello
to
graham
it
was
none
other
than
mark
twain
whom
graham
instantly
recognized
and
with
him
was
a
gentleman
who
introduced
himself
as
charles
dickens
he
gave
graham
a
wink
and
shook
his
hand
you
a
fine
young
fellow
i
predict
that
you
will
go
far
in
life
of
course
graham
was
speechless
it
suddenly
hit
him
that
he
was
in
the
company
of
some
of
the
world
greatest
human
beings
if
he
ever
got
back
home
and
tried
to
tell
people
they
would
be
sure
to
lock
him
up
and
throw
away
the
key
mark
twain
asked
how
things
were
going
and
assured
him
that
while
the
plane
would
not
be
able
to
transport
him
home
he
felt
certain
that
when
the
time
came
a
way
would
be
found
which
would
enable
him
to
return
if
not
mark
twain
said
not
to
worry
there
never
be
a
dull
moment
in
oz
that
just
great
thought
graham
now
there
was
a
chance
that
he
would
not
get
back
but
did
not
shakespeare
say
that
he
wanted
him
to
inform
the
world
that
he
had
written
his
own
stuff
he
would
not
have
said
that
if
he
did
not
think
that
the
boy
would
get
home
to
tell
the
tale
am
i
saying
thought
graham
of
this
is
really
happening
i
just
having
the
most
gigantic
craziest
dream
anyone
has
ever
by
the
way
said
mark
twain
interrupting
graham
thoughts
here
are
a
couple
of
letters
i
forgot
to
mail
to
my
poet
friend
bayard
taylor
they
should
probably
be
in
some
collection
somewhere
so
if
you
take
them
back
with
you
i
appreciate
it
i
said
in
one
letter
that
probably
forget
to
stamp
it
and
i
did
twain
handed
graham
the
letters
and
indicated
that
he
did
not
mind
the
boy
reading
them
if
he
wanted
to
i
go
thought
graham
in
my
own
in
any
event
he
settled
back
in
the
seat
and
began
to
read
the
letters
however
before
he
could
really
get
started
charles
dickens
interrupted
him
as
usual
this
twain
fellow
takes
over
and
hogs
the
conversation
in
the
very
near
future
young
graham
you
and
i
will
get
together
and
i
tell
you
some
very
interesting
stories
of
my
childhood
in
the
meantime
he
said
scribbling
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
had
some
kind
of
drawing
on
it
i
have
autographed
a
sketch
of
boz
to
take
back
with
you
boz
was
the
name
i
used
when
i
first
embarked
on
my
literary
adventures
in
case
you
are
wondering
if
there
is
a
cryptic
connection
between
boz
and
baum
and
oz
you
have
to
keep
wondering
about
that
i
was
born
at
portsea
portsmouth
a
few
minutes
before
midnight
on
the
seventh
of
february
years
before
baum
was
born
i
came
to
oz
in
when
baum
was
only
fourteen
years
old
he
was
not
destined
to
write
about
oz
until
some
thirty
years
later
now
when
you
come
back
i
tell
you
some
more
about
my
early
days
and
make
sure
that
our
friend
twain
does
bask
in
his
limelight
while
we
having
our
important
discussions
illustration
now
you
listen
up
dickens
sir
said
mark
twain
with
mock
anger
for
they
were
actually
the
best
of
friends
i
resent
that
and
i
wo
have
you
filling
the
boy
head
with
a
lot
of
imaginary
adventures
and
strange
connections
between
words
next
you
be
telling
him
there
a
link
between
the
land
of
ev
and
robert
evans
or
even
more
ludicrous
that
frank
oz
and
michael
ovitz
of
hollywood
have
a
mystical
link
to
oz
because
they
have
oz
in
their
names
or
even
more
ludicrous
that
you
and
chris
dulabone
have
a
connection
because
you
both
have
the
initials
i
mean
how
far
can
you
go
with
this
stuff
i
telling
the
boy
about
real
things
and
about
real
life
dickens
just
shook
his
head
slowly
and
turned
to
graham
i
really
pay
much
attention
to
his
rambling
go
ahead
and
read
his
boring
letters
before
he
has
a
kitten
i
wo
forget
my
promise
to
you
and
we
have
a
delightfully
interesting
time
together
you
see
and
i
promise
you
my
stories
will
not
be
imaginary
oh
by
the
way
here
some
of
my
correspondence
you
might
wish
to
take
back
with
you
one
is
a
letter
and
note
i
sent
to
my
american
friend
fields
of
boston
and
also
some
beverage
recipes
i
sent
to
fields
also
an
announcement
of
two
plays
i
produced
one
of
which
i
acted
in
and
you
not
the
only
actor
around
here
dickens
sir
interrupted
twain
i
acted
in
plays
too
for
example
i
was
in
of
a
in
your
fields
by
the
way
said
i
was
wonderful
in
it
and
as
long
as
you
producing
letters
you
wrote
to
fields
i
give
young
graham
a
copy
of
a
letter
that
i
wrote
to
fields
so
what
do
you
think
about
that
graham
was
astounded
to
hear
these
two
personages
fighting
like
children
and
competing
for
his
attention
what
would
his
history
teacher
and
his
fellow
classmates
think
he
accepted
the
additional
material
then
settled
down
to
begin
reading
as
the
two
men
continued
to
argue
all
the
way
back
to
their
seats
he
started
with
mark
letters
there
were
actually
four
letters
one
of
them
completely
in
german
which
twain
probably
had
not
meant
to
hand
him
but
the
boy
read
it
anyway
no
matter
that
he
did
not
understand
a
word
it
did
not
dawn
on
him
that
if
this
was
a
dream
where
did
the
german
words
come
from
if
they
were
not
in
his
consciousness
to
begin
with
below
is
a
copy
of
the
letters
for
the
record
although
it
is
suggested
that
the
reader
skim
over
them
for
now
as
they
are
not
relevant
except
as
historical
interest

lieber

do
know
whether
it
ought
to
be
herr
or
herrn
am
much
obliged
for
the
letter
it
was
from
friend
whom
i
have
been
trying
to
ferret
out
yes
we
still
live
at
the
shall
doubtless
continue
to
do
so
until
the
neighborhood
of
august
but
i
only
eat
and
sleep
there
my
is
the
second
story
of
a
little
wirthschaft
which
stands
at
the
base
of
the
tower
on
the
summit
of
the
konigsstuhl
i
walk
up
there
every
morning
at
write
until
talk
the
most
hopeless
and
unimprovable
german
with
the
family
then
tramp
down
to
the
hotel
for
the
night
it
is
a
schones
aussicht
up
there
as
you
may
remember
the
exercise
of
climbing
up
there
is
invigorating
but
devilish
i
have
just
written
regrets
to
the
paris
literary
convention
i
did
hate
to
have
to
miss
that
entertainment
but
i
knew
that
if
i
went
there
spent
a
fortnight
it
would
take
me
another
fortnight
to
get
settled
down
into
the
harness
again
could
afford
that
the
emperor
is
a
splendid
old
hero
that
he
could
survive
such
wounds
never
entered
my
head
yet
by
the
news
i
judge
he
is
actually
recovering
it
is
worth
something
to
be
a
lincoln
or
a
kaiser
wilhelm
it
gives
a
man
a
better
opinion
of
the
world
to
show
appreciation
for
such
men
what
is
better
love
of
i
have
not
seen
anything
of
this
outburst
of
affectionate
indignation
since
assassination
gave
the
common
globe
a
sense
of

habe
der
consul
smith
gesehen
ein
paar
wochen
ago
told
him
about
that
pass
und
er
hat
mir
gesagt
das
er
wurde
be
absent
from
this
gegen
something
zwei
oder
drei
wochen
aber
wann
er
sollte
hier
wieder
nachkommen
wollte
er

it
off

now
as
to
the
grammar
of
this
language
i
have
conquered
the
accusative
case
yet
i
began
with
that
there
are
three
more
it
begins
to
seem
to
me
that
i
have
got
to
try
to
get
along
with
the
accusative
alone
leave
the
rest
of
this
grammar
to
be
tackled
in
the
future
life
with
our
kindest
remembrances
to
you
yours
yrs
sincerely
clemens
hotel
de
de
geneve
my
dear
taylor
i
have
learned
the
german
language
forgotten
it
again
so
i
resume
english
once
more
i
have
just
returned
from
a
walking
trip
to
mont
blanc
which
i
was
intending
to
ascend
but
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
idea
as
i
had
gone
too
early
there
was
still
snow
on
it
i
find
your
letter
here
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
forward
slote
letter
to
the
above
address
i
think
it
will
be
in
time
to
catch
me
in
any
case
i
will
make
arrangements
to
have
it
follow
me
i
am
going
to
try
to
enclose
the
necessary
stamps
in
this
but
if
i
forget
it
however
i
wo
we
have
been
poking
around
slowly
through
switzerland
for
a
month
a
week
hence
we
go
to
venice
to
rome
other
places
later
we
are
booked
for
munich
for
the
winter
one
of
these
days
i
am
going
to
whet
up
my
german
again
take
a
run
to
berlin
have
a
talk
with
you
in
that
fine
old
tongue
yrs
ever
clemens
no
karlstrasse
stock
munich
my
dear
taylor
when
we
were
poking
around
italy
or
weeks
ago
i
was
told
that
you
were
ill
but
straightway
saw
it
contradicted
in
a
newspaper
now
comes
this
paragraph
in
galignani
which
not
only
shows
that
the
contradiction
was
erroneous
but
shows
how
ignorant
one
may
be
in
this
country
about
what
is
happening
only
a
few
hundred
miles
away
especially
when
one
is
buried
in
work
neither
talks
with
people
or
often
looks
in
the
paper
we
three
folks
are
heartily
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
coming
happily
out
of
it
we
are
venturing
to
hope
that
by
this
time
you
are
wholly
restored
we
are
located
for
the
winter
i
suppose
but
the
children
are
having
such
a
run
of
coughs
diptheria
sic
that
i
ca
tell
at
what
moment
clemens
may
take
fright
flee
to
some
kindlier
climate
however
i
stick
hard
at
work
make
what
literary
hay
i
can
while
we
tarry
our
little
children
talk
german
as
glibly
as
they
do
english
now
but
the
rest
of
us
are
mighty
poor
german
scholars
i
can
tell
you
rev
twitchell
who
was
over
here
with
me
a
while
conceived
a
pretty
correct
average
of
my
german
when
i
was
talking
in
my
native
tongue
about
some
rather
private
matters
in
the
hearing
of
some
germans
one
day
twitchel
said
speak
in
german
mark
some
of
these
people
may
understand
english
many
a
time
when
teachers
dictionaries
fail
to
unravel
knotty
paragraphs
we
wish
we
could
fly
to
you
for
succor
we
even
go
so
far
as
to
believe
you
can
read
a
german
newspaper
understand
it
in
moments
of
deep
irritation
i
have
been
provoked
into
expressing
the
opinion
that
you
are
the
only
foreigner
except
god
who
can
do
that
thing
i
would
not
rob
you
of
your
food
or
clothes
or
your
umbrella
but
if
i
caught
your
german
out
i
would
take
it
but
i
do
study
any
more
i
have
given
it
up
i
mine
join
in
the
kindest
remembrances
best
wishes
to
you
your
family
sincerely
yours
saml
clemens
we
are
going
to
try
to
run
over
to
berlin
in
the
as
graham
finished
mark
twain
last
letter
the
one
to
fields
dated
he
noticed
that
the
next
letter
from
dickens
to
fields
was
dated
seven
years
prior
he
wondered
if
the
two
famous
writers
had
actually
crossed
paths
or
had
just
known
the
fields
independent
of
one
another
either
way
it
was
interesting
to
note
that
they
were
contemporaries
he
had
always
imagined
that
dickens
had
lived
in
a
much
earlier
era
than
twain
well
to
continue
hotel
new
york
sunday
december
my
dear
fields
when
i
come
to
boston
for
the
two
readings
of
the
and
i
shall
be
alone
as
the
dolby
must
be
selling
elsewhere
if
you
and
fields
should
have
no
other
visitor
i
shall
be
very
glad
indeed
on
that
occasion
to
come
to
you
it
is
very
likely
that
you
may
have
some
one
come
with
you
of
course
you
will
tell
me
so
if
you
have
and
i
will
then
the
parker
house
since
i
left
boston
last
i
have
been
so
miserable
that
i
have
been
obliged
to
call
in
a
fordyce
barker
a
very
agreeable
fellow
he
was
strongly
inclined
to
stop
the
readings
altogether
for
some
few
days
but
i
pointed
out
to
him
how
we
stood
committed
and
how
i
must
go
on
if
it
could
be
done
my
great
terror
was
yesterday
matinee
but
it
went
off
splendidly
a
very
heavy
cold
indeed
an
irritated
condition
of
the
uvula
and
a
restlessly
low
state
of
the
nervous
system
were
your
friends
maladies
if
i
had
not
avoided
visiting
i
think
i
should
have
been
disabled
for
a
week
or
so
i
hear
from
london
that
the
general
question
in
society
is
what
will
be
blown
up
next
year
by
the
fenians
with
love
to
fields
believe
me
ever
affectionately
yours
and
hers
charles
following
this
letter
to
fields
was
the
note
dated
and
the
recipes
for
the
brewing
of
pleasant
beverages
last
was
the
program
for
the
two
plays
at
the
tavistock
house
theatre
graham
was
really
looking
forward
to
bringing
all
these
things
back
with
him
as
graham
got
to
the
last
line
of
the
last
letter
his
eyes
began
to
feel
heavy
the
whirlwind
of
activity
since
his
abduction
had
caught
up
with
him
just
as
he
was
falling
asleep
the
sound
of
the
voice
on
the
intercom
jerked
him
awake
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
are
approaching
historicalfigureland
international
airport
we
hope
you
had
an
enjoyable
flight
and
hope
to
see
you
again
on
oz
airlines
oh
and
to
our
young
guest
from
america
you
are
welcome
to
visit
your
friends
here
any
time
but
i
sure
you
want
to
continue
with
your
mission
and
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
we
will
be
making
an
immediate
turnaround
after
the
disembarkation
of
our
other
passengers
i
believe
you
were
brought
on
board
for
the
sole
purpose
of
delivering
some
important
documents
back
to
america
but
you
are
certainly
welcome
to
stay
as
long
as
you
wish
at
that
the
plane
landed
with
a
slight
bump
and
soon
taxied
to
the
terminal
the
doors
opened
and
everyone
began
to
file
out
many
anticipating
that
graham
would
soon
be
returning
did
engage
him
in
conversation
but
shook
his
hand
warmly
and
wished
him
well
mark
twain
gave
him
a
hug
and
said
how
much
he
had
enjoyed
his
company
he
said
that
graham
reminded
him
a
lot
of
tom
sawyer
who
he
said
currently
lived
down
the
street
from
him
seeing
graham
puzzled
expression
he
quickly
explained
that
any
imaginary
character
an
author
dreams
up
is
actually
a
person
that
the
author
has
tuned
into
and
that
an
author
rarely
has
an
original
thought
in
his
head
but
is
really
very
good
at
catching
glimpses
of
activities
present
past
or
future
somewhere
in
creation
as
mark
twain
turned
to
the
exit
graham
suddenly
remembered
a
question
that
he
had
wanted
to
ask
oh
mr
twain
he
called
i
wanted
to
ask
how
you
came
to
use
the
name
mark
twain
i
know
your
real
name
is
samuel
clemens
well
responded
twain
no
one
has
ever
asked
me
that
question
before
just
kidding
he
added
quickly
seeing
graham
expression
yes
i
am
asked
it
all
the
time
the
name
was
first
used
by
an
old
mississippi
river
pilot
named
isaiah
sellers
who
used
to
write
items
for
the
orleans
in
which
he
told
of
his
adventures
he
signed
them
mark
twain
which
in
the
parlance
of
pilots
is
a
leadsman
call
meaning
two
fathoms
or
twelve
feet
when
i
was
a
cub
pilot
i
wrote
a
burlesque
on
captain
seller
articles
and
published
it
in
a
rival
paper
under
the
signature
of
sargeant
fathom
unfortunately
the
captain
was
so
hurt
by
the
burlesque
that
he
never
wrote
another
article
i
still
feel
badly
about
it
to
this
day
for
i
would
never
have
intentionally
hurt
the
old
gentleman
feelings
anyway
in
when
i
was
working
for
the
in
virginia
city
nevada
i
wanted
a
good
pen
name
and
while
i
was
trying
to
think
of
one
i
received
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
good
captain
this
brought
to
mind
the
name
mark
twain
and
so
i
adopted
the
name
in
his
honor
i
signed
it
first
in
a
letter
from
carson
city
to
the
on
february
second
so
now
you
know
my
young
friend
said
twain
as
he
handed
him
an
autographed
photo
of
himself
something
to
keep
for
yourself
in
remembrance
of
your
visit
here
he
hugged
graham
again
and
waved
goodbye
to
the
boy
as
he
descended
from
the
plane
several
gentlemen
stopped
to
introduce
themselves
to
graham
one
said
his
name
was
ralph
waldo
emerson
and
another
nathaniel
hawthorne
yet
another
isaac
newton
who
said
graham
would
probably
become
a
scientist
undoubtedly
a
physicist
said
albert
einstein
oh
no
interjected
eugene
there
no
question
that
he
will
be
a
writer
this
last
remark
was
overheard
by
charles
lindbergh
who
insisted
that
graham
would
be
a
flyer
then
two
deep
resonant
voices
spoke
in
unison
it
is
obvious
that
the
boy
is
a
born
actor
the
speakers
were
lionel
barrymore
and
john
gilbert
but
senator
charles
sumner
had
the
final
word
whether
he
becomes
an
actor
or
not
is
immaterial
i
can
assure
you
that
this
young
man
ultimate
destiny
is
in
the
political
arena
after
the
distinguished
group
finished
arguing
about
graham
future
vocation
they
said
that
since
he
seemed
to
be
starting
an
autograph
collection
they
would
be
glad
to
add
theirs
to
the
list
even
john
dickens
father
of
charles
dickens
signed
the
sheet
then
emerson
also
handed
him
a
note
that
he
had
written
to
of
all
people
fields
do
mention
this
to
dickens
or
twain
he
said
they
just
be
jealous
turning
to
make
sure
emerson
had
disembarked
nathaniel
hawthorne
winked
at
graham
and
whispered
here
a
little
note
that
i
too
wrote
to
fields
not
a
word
now
to
emmy
dickybird
or
graham
laughed
out
loud
at
the
nicknames
being
given
to
emerson
dickens
and
twain
as
well
as
the
antics
being
displayed
by
these
great
men
then
edward
lear
who
wrote
owl
and
the
also
handed
him
a
handwritten
note
to
fields
graham
could
not
help
but
think
what
a
popular
lady
this
fields
must
have
been
in
her
day
he
wished
he
could
have
known
her
hawthorne
then
handed
him
a
signed
photograph
as
did
isaac
newton
charles
darwin
thomas
alva
edison
albert
einstein
and
wells
even
stephan
crane
and
rudyard
kipling
produced
photographs
shakespeare
was
the
last
to
leave
he
had
gone
back
to
his
seat
when
messrs
twain
and
dickens
were
vying
for
graham
attention
he
too
hugged
the
boy
as
he
said
goodbye
then
handed
him
a
piece
of
paper
i
have
written
down
the
verses
i
recited
to
you
earlier
my
friend
just
in
case
you
are
not
able
to
remember
them
all
it
is
important
that
this
be
given
simply
because
so
many
people
doubt
my
authorship
i
suppose
after
it
is
published
there
will
still
be
doubters
but
so
be
it
skeptics
have
always
existed
and
i
assume
always
will
some
people
like
to
doubt
the
reality
of
certain
phenomena
that
appears
quite
obvious
to
others
i
suspect
it
makes
them
feel
secure
something
they
no
longer
have
to
deal
with
well
good
luck
my
little
friend
i
sure
you
will
find
your
way
home
oh
incidentally
i
almost
forgot
i
want
to
dickens
and
twain
in
their
presence
but
i
was
an
actor
too
you
know
long
before
those
two
you
might
also
like
to
have
my
autographed
sketch
you
will
note
the
difference
in
my
spelling
of
my
name
and
the
later
versions
he
stuffed
a
piece
of
paper
in
shirt
pocket
as
he
exited
as
the
plane
doors
closed
behind
shakespeare
the
flight
attendant
brought
graham
a
refreshing
glass
of
lemonade
his
thoughts
turned
to
telly
who
had
been
so
sad
at
being
left
behind
he
eagerly
looked
forward
to
seeing
the
little
guy
again
graham
slept
the
entire
trip
back
he
awoke
just
as
the
plane
taxied
to
the
terminal
and
who
should
be
waiting
in
exactly
the
same
place
as
he
left
him
but
telly
who
was
so
glad
that
graham
had
returned
that
he
ran
up
and
hugged
him
for
the
longest
time
i
knew
you
come
back
he
said
that
why
i
waited
i
knew
that
the
plane
could
be
going
to
america
in
fact
i
still
do
believe
that
there
was
any
plane
or
airport
or
anything
i
think
it
was
all
some
trick
of
the
witch
to
confuse
us
planes
simply
can
not
exist
in
oz
transportation
is
either
by
foot
or
via
some
magical
contrivance
such
as
the
animated
gump
or
the
famous
red
wagon
well
i
hate
to
disappoint
you
replied
graham
waving
the
bundle
of
letters
photographs
and
drawings
in
his
hand
but
where
do
you
think
these
came
from
if
the
whole
thing
was
some
kind
of
hallucination
and
how
could
i
read
german
words
if
the
words
were
in
my
consciousness
to
begin
with
and
i
certainly
could
have
made
up
words
and
i
hate
to
disappoint
you
answered
telly
quite
tartly
but
you
might
wish
to
look
behind
you
graham
turned
to
look
behind
him
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
entire
airport
fading
away
not
only
that
but
the
papers
in
his
hand
had
also
faded
away
to
absolute
nothingness
oh
no
cried
the
boy
now
i
have
no
proof
of
my
experience
that
because
it
never
happened
telly
replied
dryly
chapter
eleven
the
winkie
country
oz
was
as
unlike
america
as
it
could
be
yet
also
familiar
it
was
not
very
long
at
all
before
graham
began
to
feel
almost
at
home
among
the
soft
yellow
countryside
of
the
vast
winkie
territory
in
which
the
pair
now
found
themselves
in
fact
graham
had
come
to
feel
so
comfortable
that
he
had
all
but
forgotten
about
the
evil
witch
he
might
have
remained
content
and
carefree
indefinitely
had
he
not
heard
the
growl
that
came
forth
from
a
nearby
bush
it
was
a
most
deafening
growl
that
sounded
as
terrible
as
a
and
as
alive
as
an
unfed
zoo
animal
graham
shuddered
he
wondered
what
sort
of
macabre
being
could
possibly
make
such
a
horrendous
noise
then
a
voice
rang
out
it
was
not
a
human
voice
at
all
and
this
made
graham
shudder
even
more
whereas
telly
seemed
quite
unfazed
that
was
only
because
he
was
walking
and
napping
at
the
same
time
apparently
he
had
switched
to
automatic
pilot
then
closed
his
eyes
as
he
drifted
into
a
state
of
oblivion
do
you
remember
how
the
wicked
witches
sent
the
terrible
forest
monster
after
the
wizard
said
the
voice
of
course
i
do
answered
a
second
voice
equally
and
who
could
forget
the
time
allidap
sent
forth
those
fearsome
gray
wolves
after
little
dorothy
they
could
easily
have
ripped
her
to
shreds
both
of
the
voices
sounded
distinctly
throaty
and
animalistic
in
fact
they
sounded
as
a
wild
beast
might
sound
could
a
wild
beast
speak
english
it
occurred
to
graham
that
this
was
oz
wild
animals
could
speak
english
and
do
you
think
that
witch
pulled
a
good
scare
when
she
sent
those
angry
birds
to
attack
dorothy
and
her
friends
said
one
of
the
wild
creatures
graham
could
take
no
more
of
this
it
was
obvious
that
they
were
surrounded
by
hidden
animals
sent
by
the
wicked
witch
to
eat
them
at
least
him
he
doubted
they
would
attempt
to
eat
telly
since
he
would
be
highly
indigestible
he
quickly
jabbed
telly
in
his
to
awaken
him
to
the
imminent
danger
and
at
the
same
time
he
stooped
over
to
grab
a
yellow
rock
from
the
ground
it
was
not
much
of
a
weapon
but
it
would
have
to
do
he
held
up
the
rock
threateningly
okay
wolves
or
monsters
or
whatever
you
are
he
shouted
i
hear
you
conspiring
and
i
know
that
you
are
working
for
the
wicked
witch
not
going
to
give
up
without
a
fight
so
i
suggest
that
you
all
go
away
he
smiled
with
a
hint
of
pride
in
his
brave
speech
but
suddenly
there
was
a
rustle
of
leaves
behind
him
and
a
huge
creature
sprang
out
from
behind
a
bush
and
leaped
at
the
pair
graham
not
wanting
to
be
attacked
from
behind
swung
himself
around
to
face
the
creature
as
he
did
so
he
absently
lowered
his
weapon
at
the
sight
of
two
rows
of
gleaming
white
fangs
and
claws
that
could
easily
have
torn
a
little
boy
like
himself
apart
in
an
instant
he
realized
that
the
rock
in
his
hand
was
a
puny
weapon
indeed
for
confronting
such
a
ferocious
beast
but
nevertheless
he
raised
it
again
as
a
sort
of
reflex
action
and
thrust
it
directly
at
the
teeth
of
the
creature
at
that
moment
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
another
set
of
jagged
teeth
and
claws
attacking
from
his
right
it
raised
a
huge
paw
and
knocked
him
off
balance
the
rock
fell
to
the
ground
out
of
reach
the
little
boy
watched
in
horror
as
one
of
the
two
animals
stepped
forward
and
looked
at
his
face
the
other
one
was
watching
telly
what
do
you
think
asked
one
of
them
looks
like
a
little
boy
and
a
tin
can
with
arms
and
legs
carrying
a
tv
set
said
the
other
the
boy
not
all
dressed
in
yellow
so
he
not
a
winkie
nor
is
he
all
in
blue
like
a
munchkin
or
purple
red
or
green
he
matches
none
of
the
oz
colors
i
wonder
where
he
came
from
maybe
he
from
ev
or
ix
can
you
speak
boy
graham
struggled
to
sit
up
while
telly
just
stood
and
glared
at
the
beasts
he
was
not
happy
with
their
description
of
him
and
was
seriously
considering
giving
them
a
but
thought
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
at
least
for
the
moment
illustration
when
graham
was
able
to
collect
himself
he
discovered
that
the
two
beasts
walked
on
all
fours
and
were
of
the
feline
persuasion
these
were
no
hungry
wolves
or
monsters
at
all
actually
they
were
a
lion
and
a
tiger
as
graham
jumped
to
his
feet
the
lion
sprang
backward
yikes
he
screamed
jumping
behind
the
tiger
is
he
to
us
i
do
think
so
answered
the
tiger
i
imagine
he
just
getting
up
to
look
for
some
at
this
point
as
if
on
cue
a
loud
growl
echoed
from
the
vicinity
of
the
tiger
not
from
his
mouth
or
throat
but
from
the
deepest
recesses
of
his
tummy
graham
looked
at
telly
and
telly
looked
at
graham
apparently
said
graham
the
angry
growling
that
we
heard
was
nothing
more
than
the
sounds
of
an
empty
stomach
so
you
are
slaves
of
the
bad
witch
or
sent
to
kill
me
the
tiger
looked
a
little
sheepish
which
is
not
easy
for
a
tiger
to
do
of
course
not
he
said
do
you
know
who
i
am
i
am
the
hungry
tiger
of
oz
everyone
heard
of
me
there
have
been
volumes
of
books
written
about
me
i
am
always
hungry
but
i
am
not
a
carnivore
i
am
afraid
i
would
feel
just
awful
if
ever
i
ate
up
one
of
my
fellow
beings
here
in
the
land
of
oz
as
you
know
all
creatures
are
treated
equally
i
ca
stand
the
thought
of
eating
up
any
organism
that
might
ultimately
become
a
friend
this
makes
me
feel
bad
too
i
am
reduced
to
a
strictly
vegetarian
diet
i
yearn
to
gobble
up
a
few
scrumptiously
delicious
fat
babies
yet
i
am
reduced
to
struggling
through
meals
of
and
loveburger
oh
if
only
my
conscience
would
let
me
feast
upon
a
fat
baby
just
once
but
alas
i
am
cursed
with
a
very
strong
conscience
then
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
said
graham
what
about
this
lion
he
is
the
cowardly
lion
of
oz
explained
the
hungry
tiger
he
got
a
pretty
good
conscience
too
then
why
did
he
attack
me
like
that
graham
wanted
to
know
i
did
attack
you
replied
the
cowardly
lion
i
heard
you
say
that
there
were
some
wolves
or
monsters
or
who
were
working
for
the
wicked
witch
you
announced
that
you
were
going
to
fight
them
so
i
naturally
jumped
behind
you
to
cower
in
fear
oh
said
graham
i
misunderstood
your
actions
so
continued
the
lion
are
there
really
slaves
of
the
around
here
i
heard
them
talking
about
how
a
witch
sent
a
forest
monster
and
some
wolves
to
attack
innocent
people
said
graham
but
that
was
us
explained
the
tiger
we
like
to
talk
about
oz
history
a
lot
we
were
in
the
bushes
looking
for
some
yummy
kiwi
fruits
to
help
satisfy
my
hunger
when
you
came
along
so
the
witch
is
after
me
after
all
guess
not
replied
the
tiger
should
she
be
well
he
said
meekly
i
played
a
couple
of
rather
crude
tricks
on
her
i
suspect
that
she
be
pretty
peeved
when
she
does
find
me
i
left
her
admiring
herself
in
a
well
a
kind
of
trance
it
kind
of
hard
to
explain
but
when
she
finds
a
mirror
well
i
dread
to
think
what
will
happen
the
lion
and
the
tiger
looked
at
one
another
the
lion
stood
to
his
full
height
which
was
actually
somewhat
larger
than
most
of
the
lions
we
can
see
in
zoos
and
smiled
a
toothy
smile
i
protect
you
my
son
he
snarled
and
how
he
could
snarl
and
smile
at
the
same
time
was
beyond
graham
but
let
it
suffice
that
he
did
do
it
no
wicked
witch
will
get
of
any
pals
of
mine
i
a
raging
lion
after
all
i
am
big
i
am
strong
i
the
unchallenged
king
of
the
beasts
i
am
the
he
dove
behind
a
bush
when
the
tiger
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
er
excuse
me
said
the
tiger
but
i
only
wanted
to
get
your
attention
sorry
the
lion
said
meekly
slinking
back
into
the
open
i
think
we
should
learn
about
our
new
chum
suggested
the
hungry
tiger
after
all
now
that
you
vowed
to
protect
him
are
you
just
a
little
bit
curious
as
to
who
he
is
graham
seeing
that
he
was
expected
to
introduce
himself
told
the
two
cats
who
he
was
and
how
he
came
to
be
in
oz
how
he
had
tricked
the
witch
and
how
he
met
telly
and
how
they
had
conspired
together
to
trick
her
again
et
cetera
et
cetera
the
cowardly
lion
shuddered
the
hungry
tiger
swallowed
hard
an
act
that
normally
comes
quite
easily
to
him
even
graham
became
a
little
nervous
as
he
recounted
his
dealings
with
the
witch
and
was
reminded
that
he
was
in
imminent
danger
if
you
two
would
care
to
accompany
us
you
are
certainly
very
welcome
graham
said
to
the
lion
and
tiger
well
i
do
know
about
that
replied
the
lion
at
the
moment
the
old
witch
is
bothering
us
and
if
she
sees
us
with
you
two
she
might
decide
that
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
if
you
know
what
i
mean
oh
do
be
such
a
coward
admonished
the
tiger
she
see
right
away
that
we
not
birds
at
that
everyone
laughed
as
the
four
headed
off
into
the
sunset
chapter
twelve
the
meeting
with
princess
ozma
graham
knew
that
he
would
need
to
have
a
good
plan
of
action
if
he
was
going
to
get
home
in
spite
of
the
witch
he
looked
beseechingly
at
his
two
feline
friends
both
were
certainly
both
powerful
and
agile
still
the
boy
knew
only
too
well
that
the
four
of
them
were
no
match
for
the
wicked
witch
she
after
all
had
the
ability
to
transport
herself
to
any
land
she
wished
possibly
even
to
other
planets
if
she
yearned
to
take
them
in
tow
as
her
prisoners
it
seemed
impossible
to
stop
her
it
terrible
roared
the
cowardly
lion
i
remember
when
that
green
witch
appeared
at
the
parade
she
scared
the
living
daylights
out
of
me
but
added
the
hungry
tiger
what
i
ca
figure
out
is
why
queen
ozma
never
did
anything
about
her
she
could
easily
have
looked
into
the
magic
picture
to
find
the
villainess
made
a
wish
or
two
on
the
magic
belt
and
presto
no
more
wicked
witch
that
puzzling
indeed
agreed
the
cowardly
lion
with
an
obvious
shudder
could
the
witch
have
done
something
to
ozma
maybe
ozma
is
under
some
awful
spell
like
she
was
that
time
when
she
lost
her
memory
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
we
have
got
to
save
her
now
let
not
jump
to
any
wild
conclusions
replied
the
tiger
a
low
growl
issuing
forth
from
his
stomach
i
suggest
that
we
hurry
back
to
the
emerald
city
to
ask
queen
ozma
for
her
help
if
she
is
under
any
spells
the
wizard
or
glinda
will
help
us
if
she
is
not
under
any
vile
enchantment
then
her
magic
belt
can
easily
wish
away
the
witch
she
can
also
send
graham
home
with
the
belt
but
what
if
the
witch
has
enchanted
the
wizard
and
glinda
too
bellowed
the
lion
tears
running
down
his
face
what
if
she
made
them
all
into
little
candy
corns
or
tea
bags
or
jigglers
or
something
the
tiger
stomach
roared
at
the
sound
of
these
food
words
pull
yourself
together
and
stop
talking
about
food
he
said
we
ca
go
losing
our
heads
over
things
that
we
do
know
for
sure
maybe
the
whole
simply
slipped
ozma
mind
the
cowardly
lion
looked
at
his
chum
in
a
reproachful
manner
tige
he
said
do
you
really
believe
that
our
beloved
queen
is
so
i
think
we
owe
her
a
bit
more
respect
than
that
we
all
saw
that
repulsive
old
woman
you
saw
her
too
tige
and
that
you
heard
it
no
our
ozma
would
have
done
something
to
stop
that
wicked
old
by
now
and
so
would
glinda
and
the
too
none
of
them
would
have
forgotten
about
all
of
that
let
alone
all
of
no
i
can
feel
it
in
my
bones
she
done
something
dreadful
to
them
all
they
are
enchanted
or
cursed
or
destroyed
or
are
you
trying
to
scare
yourself
said
the
tiger
i
have
to
try
wailed
the
lion
ca
we
go
to
your
emerald
city
to
find
out
asked
graham
who
felt
that
all
this
talk
was
doing
nothing
for
anyone
we
have
to
go
there
it
the
only
way
to
find
out
for
sure
our
young
friend
has
a
good
head
for
logic
said
the
tiger
hurry
and
get
to
the
emerald
city
the
two
could
move
almost
as
swiftly
as
the
wind
graham
of
course
could
not
possibly
have
hoped
to
keep
pace
with
them
had
he
had
to
walk
on
his
own
but
fortunately
the
beasts
were
willing
to
allow
graham
and
telly
to
ride
upon
their
backs
this
made
the
journey
go
much
more
quickly
in
only
a
couple
of
days
the
green
of
the
city
was
in
sight
in
short
order
they
got
to
the
front
gates
which
led
into
this
amazing
and
phenomenally
beautiful
capital
of
oz
graham
could
not
conceal
his
awe
at
the
sight
of
the
place
home
again
said
the
hungry
tiger
now
we
get
to
go
in
and
see
what
poor
ozma
and
the
wizard
have
been
into
sighed
the
cowardly
lion
imby
amby
the
guardian
of
the
gates
met
the
trio
with
a
smile
of
greeting
hello
he
said
cheerfully
imby
retorted
the
tiger
will
you
kindly
tell
my
dear
boy
here
that
our
queen
has
not
been
transformed
into
a
gelatin
mold
i
should
hope
not
replied
the
guardian
last
time
i
saw
her
she
was
playing
checkers
with
betsy
bobbin
seemed
to
be
winning
too
the
tiger
smiled
knowingly
then
nudged
the
lion
in
a
friendly
way
come
on
he
said
let
go
see
our
queen
she
will
certainly
set
things
right
straightaway
the
trio
hurried
into
the
palace
and
quickly
located
the
young
ruler
she
was
gaily
sipping
a
cup
of
herbal
tea
and
having
a
lively
conversation
with
the
scarecrow
and
the
patchwork
girl
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
two
old
friends
with
the
strangers
she
stopped
in
what
wrong
she
asked
you
look
upset
about
something
the
hungry
tiger
bowed
low
before
the
little
girl
your
majesty
this
young
man
graham
has
come
from
america
and
has
escaped
the
clutches
of
a
very
wicked
witch
surely
you
remember
the
parade
and
the
horrible
threat
that
this
witch
spoke
surely
replied
ozma
the
patchwork
girl
impulsively
did
five
handsprings
and
landed
on
the
tiger
broad
back
where
she
proceeded
to
recite
the
following
in
a
voice
wicked
witch
was
bad
indeed
her
evil
soul
was
full
of
greed
to
show
her
powers
she
did
try
and
on
her
broomstick
she
did
fly
she
tried
to
capture
everyone
she
thought
that
it
would
be
such
fun
but
clever
ozma
and
the
wiz
would
never
let
her
do
this
biz
a
wholesome
spell
has
now
been
cast
so
that
old
witch
time
is
past
the
good
old
wizard
cast
a
spell
that
changed
the
witch
into
a
bell
she
now
can
make
a
bathtub
ring
but
can
not
do
another
thing
ozma
smiled
sweetly
what
scraps
is
telling
you
in
her
own
spirited
way
is
that
your
witch
was
already
dealt
with
a
day
or
two
ago
i
saw
what
she
had
done
in
my
magic
picture
and
i
had
the
wonderful
wizard
of
oz
take
care
of
it
in
his
unique
manner
he
transformed
the
witch
into
a
she
will
remain
in
that
form
until
such
time
as
she
has
a
change
of
heart
when
she
becomes
truly
repentant
and
is
willing
to
become
a
citizen
of
oz
she
will
magically
become
a
silver
christmas
bell
instead
of
the
old
at
that
point
we
will
restore
her
to
her
human
form
and
allow
her
to
live
a
brand
new
life
as
a
new
and
changed
individual
a
echoed
the
lion
all
trace
of
fear
having
suddenly
vanished
from
his
heart
how
interesting
i
remember
a
time
years
ago
when
the
wizard
did
a
similar
trick
with
some
troublesome
imps
he
made
them
into
buttons
which
would
change
color
when
they
repented
yes
said
ozma
as
for
you
friend
telly
i
am
sure
you
will
become
fast
friends
with
the
tin
woodman
and
the
two
of
them
are
upstairs
right
now
admiring
their
similarities
and
differences
would
you
like
to
have
me
summon
them
oh
please
do
put
in
the
scarecrow
i
love
to
see
graham
metal
friend
meet
them
if
his
heart
is
as
pure
as
that
of
my
dear
friend
nick
chopper
i
know
that
he
will
be
a
very
good
and
wholesome
person
they
all
agreed
and
within
minutes
the
two
metal
men
stepped
into
the
room
nick
chopper
the
famous
tin
woodman
of
oz
had
been
recently
polished
and
so
was
feeling
especially
bright
and
chipper
who
was
a
clockwork
man
made
out
of
copper
was
always
very
bright
so
long
as
his
clockwork
was
kept
wound
up
telly
seemed
to
be
very
happy
in
the
company
of
these
new
friends
illustration
i
think
that
it
time
to
organize
a
big
celebration
to
commemorate
the
overthrow
of
the
wicked
witch
and
to
honor
our
new
friends
suggested
the
patchwork
girl
a
grand
idea
agreed
the
scarecrow
and
i
like
to
hold
it
in
the
cabin
that
tattypoo
made
for
us
near
her
mountain
retreat
interjected
the
patchwork
girl
indeed
agreed
the
scarecrow
there
is
plenty
of
land
there
we
could
have
games
like
races
and
a
big
parade
and
a
band
or
two
and
it
sounds
great
said
scraps
leaping
up
grabbing
a
chandelier
and
swinging
from
it
while
bursting
into
song
party
is
the
thing
to
do
whenever
something
pleases
you
i
awful
glad
the
witch
is
belled
for
lots
of
troubles
she
have
spelled
and
i
am
glad
to
meet
young
graham
i
hope
he
wo
think
i
a
ham
and
telly
is
a
funny
man
i
hope
he
be
there
if
he
can
a
lovely
time
we
all
will
spend
we
will
not
want
it
to
she
sang
in
her
most
dignified
manner
of
course
scraps
and
dignity
are
about
as
compatible
as
oil
and
water
but
her
words
were
certainly
fitting
to
the
occasion
the
celebration
was
a
great
success
celebrities
from
all
over
oz
were
there
even
the
former
good
witch
of
the
north
put
in
an
appearance
it
was
a
celebration
of
nearly
the
magnitude
of
that
which
had
caused
the
arrival
of
the
wicked
witch
in
the
first
place
except
that
there
were
no
large
floats
there
had
been
no
time
for
the
oz
folk
to
construct
any
besides
it
seemed
to
everyone
involved
that
they
would
not
be
especially
apropos
under
the
circumstances
when
the
festivities
were
over
ozma
approached
graham
well
she
said
in
her
youthful
but
queenly
voice
have
you
enjoyed
your
little
trip
to
oz
oh
yes
replied
the
boy
and
i
so
glad
to
have
met
you
wait
until
i
tell
my
little
brother
about
all
of
this
he
be
so
surprised
graham
replied
ozma
you
ca
tell
your
little
brother
about
any
of
the
things
you
seen
here
even
about
meeting
dorothy
or
the
scarecrow
but
began
the
boy
graham
she
continued
oz
is
a
place
that
would
be
very
interesting
to
some
of
the
people
back
in
america
so
long
as
they
know
of
oz
as
only
a
fantasy
they
will
not
come
to
look
for
us
but
our
continent
and
its
surrounding
regions
are
very
big
our
territory
makes
your
mortal
continents
look
like
rhode
island
because
some
mortals
do
not
have
your
values
and
think
of
no
one
but
themselves
or
their
bank
accounts
they
would
begin
to
seriously
search
out
our
continent
as
it
comprises
so
much
land
they
might
eventually
break
through
our
magical
barriers
and
invisibility
spells
even
the
spell
that
diverts
them
off
course
whenever
they
try
to
reach
us
these
barriers
have
been
crossed
by
accident
in
the
past
as
you
know
if
a
wicked
mortal
were
trying
to
do
it
intentionally
he
might
find
a
way
but
no
one
has
ever
done
it
before
said
graham
and
my
brother
would
so
love
to
hear
about
oz
he
never
do
anything
bad
i
promise
i
am
not
doubting
the
righteousness
of
your
brother
but
secrets
get
out
and
people
pass
them
along
i
know
this
is
true
i
can
not
allow
you
to
tell
anyone
back
home
about
oz
being
a
real
place
i
want
it
to
be
considered
only
a
silly
fairy
tale
for
children
this
is
our
greatest
protection
i
understand
said
graham
i
wo
tell
him
about
it
but
you
have
proven
yourself
by
your
love
for
telly
said
the
queen
you
can
stay
and
live
in
oz
forever
you
will
be
a
citizen
here
where
you
will
never
have
to
grow
old
you
will
never
again
know
sickness
and
you
will
never
have
to
die
graham
was
taken
aback
by
the
offer
you
mean
it
he
said
i
can
stay
here
and
be
with
telly
and
the
cowardly
lion
and
the
hungry
tiger
forever
you
can
graham
still
seemed
overwhelmed
that
would
be
super
he
said
but
my
family
i
love
my
family
ca
you
bring
them
here
to
live
as
well
no
ozma
said
solemnly
that
is
not
possible
you
are
invited
only
because
you
have
proven
your
value
even
the
shaggy
man
had
to
prove
his
worth
before
staying
on
in
oz
your
family
has
not
proven
itself
worthy
you
alone
may
stay
in
oz
then
i
want
to
go
home
right
now
said
graham
i
ca
leave
them
i
thought
you
say
that
sighed
ozma
but
you
already
know
too
much
i
ca
send
you
back
there
it
is
that
i
do
trust
you
but
i
fear
that
someday
you
may
let
the
secret
slip
maybe
you
talk
in
your
sleep
maybe
you
grow
older
and
be
taken
in
by
the
terrible
drugs
and
alcohol
which
are
so
common
in
the
mortal
lands
these
might
make
you
say
things
that
you
normally
never
say
i
sure
it
could
never
happen
to
a
boy
like
you
but
what
if
i
sorry
graham
you
must
stay
here
i
have
already
arranged
for
you
to
have
a
lovely
mansion
not
far
from
here
or
you
can
stay
with
telly
or
whomever
you
please
you
can
take
any
apartments
you
might
desire
in
the
palace
if
you
prefer
in
fact
you
are
free
to
roam
as
you
please
i
do
want
to
have
you
think
of
yourself
as
a
prisoner
i
know
it
will
seem
that
way
at
first
but
i
promise
you
that
the
benefits
of
living
in
oz
will
soon
drive
those
ideas
from
your
mind
graham
looked
at
ozma
any
sympathy
he
might
have
felt
for
her
was
gone
he
saw
her
point
but
he
did
feel
more
like
a
prisoner
than
a
citizen
of
oz
chapter
thirteen
a
window
a
window
graham
apartment
in
the
palace
was
not
at
all
and
it
looked
as
if
it
had
not
been
lived
in
for
some
time
but
he
agreed
to
live
there
he
had
no
desire
to
live
in
ozma
palace
but
he
wanted
to
have
the
ability
to
visit
his
friends
on
occasion
he
still
saw
ozma
as
a
captor
all
he
had
ever
wanted
was
to
go
home
and
now
he
knew
that
he
was
never
going
to
achieve
that
goal
in
his
heart
he
hated
ozma
for
doing
this
to
him
the
very
least
she
could
do
would
have
been
to
bring
his
family
here
why
was
she
so
structured
about
things
this
was
hardly
the
stuff
that
nice
fairy
tales
were
made
of
graham
apartment
was
in
a
very
secluded
part
of
the
palace
where
he
would
not
have
to
see
anyone
unless
he
elected
to
there
were
no
neighbors
to
speak
of
graham
sort
of
preferred
it
that
way
he
did
not
want
to
speak
his
mind
about
the
cruel
little
queen
to
anyone
she
was
so
mean
that
he
feared
she
would
make
a
out
of
him
if
he
seemed
the
least
bit
insubordinate
so
he
sat
in
an
old
settee
and
brooded
he
had
a
good
supply
of
books
to
keep
him
company
and
all
of
the
ozian
celebrities
had
agreed
to
visit
him
often
at
the
time
he
had
agreed
to
these
visits
but
now
as
he
sat
staring
at
the
wall
he
wished
that
they
would
not
come
he
yearned
only
to
be
left
alone
but
one
can
after
all
only
be
left
alone
for
a
short
while
before
he
becomes
lonesome
and
graham
was
not
so
very
long
in
becoming
anxious
for
some
sort
of
companionship
or
at
least
some
form
of
stimulation
he
went
to
a
bookshelf
and
perused
the
titles
on
the
various
tomes
that
were
there
emerald
city
of
was
among
them
graham
sullenly
took
it
in
his
hands
and
flopped
it
open
to
his
astonishment
he
found
there
a
reference
to
dorothy
aunt
and
uncle
being
allowed
to
come
and
live
in
oz
to
be
close
to
her
not
only
that
but
it
recounted
how
dorothy
had
come
to
visit
oz
on
many
occasions
gone
back
home
to
kansas
and
even
told
people
about
oz
while
she
was
there
this
really
made
graham
feel
insulted
if
ozma
could
trust
a
girl
why
not
a
boy
for
the
next
couple
of
hours
graham
pored
over
the
many
books
that
he
found
in
the
palace
library
vast
collection
each
and
every
time
a
person
adult
boy
or
girl
came
to
oz
ozma
had
always
treated
him
as
she
had
dorothy
in
fact
the
very
shaggy
man
that
ozma
had
mentioned
actually
had
to
beg
to
stay
in
oz
ozma
had
practically
insisted
that
he
be
sent
home
why
was
she
acting
so
cruelly
toward
himself
but
toward
no
one
else
he
stood
up
indignantly
and
decided
then
and
there
to
make
his
way
back
to
the
throne
room
and
have
a
word
with
ozma
that
mean
little
girl
would
have
a
darn
good
explanation
for
this
or
she
would
have
a
black
eye
graham
walked
the
corridors
of
the
palace
for
about
twenty
minutes
but
they
seemed
to
have
twisted
and
turned
around
they
were
not
as
he
remembered
them
at
all
he
wondered
at
this
could
ozma
have
done
this
to
permanently
entrap
him
he
grew
to
hate
ozma
more
and
more
as
the
minutes
ticked
away
the
corridors
seemed
endless
and
none
seemed
to
lead
to
anyplace
in
particular
either
ooh
he
said
gritting
his
teeth
in
frustration
when
i
find
that
little
twirp
of
a
queen
going
to
show
her
but
three
more
hours
of
frustration
brought
him
no
closer
to
this
goal
at
last
he
flung
himself
to
the
ground
and
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
i
hate
you
princess
ozma
he
grunted
i
hate
you
illustration
then
from
sheer
exhaustion
he
fell
asleep
he
remained
asleep
for
an
undeterminable
period
of
time
he
was
awakened
by
a
shaft
of
light
in
his
eyes
a
window
there
was
a
window
he
had
overlooked
it
in
his
frustrated
exhaustion
but
now
it
was
evident
to
him
oh
it
was
a
bit
high
but
he
felt
that
he
might
be
able
to
jump
up
to
it
he
picked
himself
up
his
body
was
still
a
bit
exhausted
but
he
was
a
young
boy
and
in
good
shape
he
made
his
leap
then
he
picked
himself
up
and
tried
again
it
took
him
sixteen
tries
to
make
it
but
he
finally
managed
to
grab
hold
of
the
edge
of
the
window
there
was
no
glass
so
he
pulled
himself
through
the
land
outside
was
a
barren
mass
of
crowded
and
gnarled
old
trees
obviously
not
a
part
of
the
emerald
city
that
would
be
mentioned
in
a
travel
agent
brochures
but
graham
was
determined
to
find
ozma
he
pushed
aside
the
prickling
weeds
as
best
he
could
and
trudged
through
the
dust
and
muck
of
the
area
it
nauseated
him
but
he
moved
on
he
thought
how
odd
it
was
that
the
emerald
city
of
oz
would
have
such
an
unpleasant
area
in
it
but
he
let
these
thoughts
dissolve
as
he
recalled
what
an
unpleasant
queen
the
place
had
after
several
hours
of
fighting
against
the
weeds
most
of
which
were
twice
his
size
he
was
surprised
to
hear
a
small
voice
who
are
you
it
said
illustration
i
graham
he
replied
really
said
the
voice
i
love
your
crackers
where
are
you
i
in
a
bunch
of
weeds
he
said
oh
how
come
i
was
trying
to
find
the
front
of
ozma
palace
can
you
help
me
find
it
i
could
said
the
voice
but
you
are
about
four
thousand
miles
out
of
your
way
what
said
graham
you
wrong
i
just
escaped
out
of
a
window
in
ozma
palace
a
few
hours
ago
and
i
know
i
have
made
any
progress
hardly
at
all
i
afraid
it
you
who
are
wrong
replied
the
voice
ozma
palace
is
a
long
long
journey
from
here
ah
here
you
are
a
burst
of
sudden
fire
appeared
out
of
nowhere
it
burned
away
a
number
of
the
weeds
and
graham
saw
a
clear
tunnel
through
the
weeds
to
open
air
in
addition
to
that
however
he
saw
the
most
unusual
creature
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
not
very
large
but
it
looked
as
if
it
were
composed
of
several
squares
and
rectangles
all
straight
edges
nothing
rounded
it
had
thick
leathery
skin
and
three
glistening
hairs
grew
from
the
tip
of
its
rectangular
tail
the
creature
spoke
now
that
i
have
a
face
to
go
along
with
the
voice
i
can
see
that
you
are
a
stranger
in
these
parts
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
i
am
he
who
is
called
the
woozy
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
i
am
the
only
woozy
in
the
world
so
i
never
had
need
of
any
other
particular
name
happy
to
meet
you
graham
i
hope
that
you
are
a
nice
fellow
and
not
some
meany
who
will
say
to
me
stuttered
graham
i
would
say
a
thing
like
that
i
sure
but
i
have
just
climbed
out
a
window
of
ozma
palace
i
possibly
be
as
far
from
there
as
you
say
yes
you
are
replied
the
woozy
you
must
be
mistaken
about
the
window
but
ozma
was
there
and
the
scarecrow
and
the
tin
woodman
and
the
patchwork
girl
and
and
and
everyone
i
sorry
my
friend
graham
said
the
woozy
there
is
no
palace
here
the
only
building
here
that
i
know
of
is
that
one
that
was
built
by
the
old
wicked
witch
of
the
west
the
winkies
say
that
she
used
to
have
a
bunch
of
winding
corridors
in
there
that
were
meant
to
drive
her
slaves
nuts
if
they
ever
were
sent
there
as
a
punishment
but
how
did
i
get
there
from
the
emerald
city
ozma
was
really
mean
to
me
so
i
locked
myself
away
in
a
room
there
ozma
was
mean
to
you
the
woozy
said
with
obvious
shock
are
you
a
villain
graham
quickly
related
the
whole
story
to
the
woozy
who
seemed
to
be
the
only
friend
however
unfamiliar
he
had
had
around
him
in
an
awfully
long
time
my
replied
the
woozy
that
is
quite
a
story
but
i
fear
you
were
duped
my
friend
duped
echoed
he
i
think
you
were
never
in
the
emerald
city
somehow
the
witch
sent
you
here
and
created
a
very
elaborate
hallucination
for
you
she
uses
these
weeds
for
that
sometimes
that
why
i
was
burning
them
away
i
can
make
fire
come
out
of
my
eyes
when
i
angry
and
these
wicked
weeds
certainly
make
me
feel
that
way
want
to
see
no
sighed
graham
so
you
mean
that
was
ozma
who
talked
to
me
certainly
not
the
woozy
was
indignant
our
dear
queen
is
not
like
that
at
all
i
can
assure
you
that
you
spoke
to
a
hallucination
caused
by
an
infusion
made
out
of
these
dratted
weeds
yes
my
little
squiggley
came
the
voice
of
the
witch
you
have
assessed
the
situation
very
well
the
witch
appeared
seemingly
out
of
nowhere
did
you
really
think
i
was
fooled
by
that
ruse
you
must
think
i
a
real
moron
but
i
have
won
telly
is
disposed
of
for
good
allidap
shouted
the
woozy
the
fake
one
from
the
parade
it
her
at
the
sight
of
the
hated
individual
a
huge
blast
of
fire
burst
forth
from
his
eyeballs
the
witch
ducked
aside
but
not
before
getting
her
face
badly
blackened
and
her
clothing
ruined
you
just
wait
spat
the
woozy
at
the
evil
creature
ozma
will
look
for
you
in
her
magic
picture
yet
you
just
wait
she
make
a
spell
that
will
send
you
away
for
good
nope
smiled
the
witch
that
covered
you
remember
how
realistic
my
illusionary
emerald
city
was
well
i
watched
and
waited
for
a
trusted
friend
of
ozma
to
look
into
that
silly
old
magic
picture
then
i
gave
it
to
him
a
very
beautiful
hallucination
he
saw
me
fall
into
a
river
and
dissolve
completely
so
as
far
as
ozma
is
concerned
i
am
destroyed
she
have
no
further
need
to
suspect
otherwise
so
she
will
not
seek
me
out
the
woozy
was
taken
aback
but
he
quickly
composed
himself
and
added
and
glinda
will
read
about
you
in
the
magic
book
of
oz
similarly
handled
grinned
the
witch
any
other
bright
ideas
another
blast
of
fire
issued
forth
from
the
woozy
eyes
the
weeds
went
up
in
a
towering
inferno
let
get
out
of
here
said
the
woozy
to
graham
contrary
to
what
some
people
think
i
am
not
made
of
wood
i
have
to
breathe
and
i
fear
that
this
smoke
might
be
as
hallucinogenic
as
the
stuff
she
makes
from
the
weeds
the
two
ran
away
as
fast
as
they
could
at
such
time
as
they
were
far
enough
from
the
smoke
to
breathe
easy
graham
stopped
running
the
woozy
did
not
seem
to
notice
and
he
just
kept
right
on
going
and
going
and
going
graham
was
alone
again
but
at
least
he
was
out
of
the
terrible
witch
reach
indeed
the
witch
was
presently
having
a
most
exciting
dream
about
plush
animals
which
could
be
inflated
to
the
size
of
a
house
and
then
used
as
in
the
thermostat
of
life
which
likes
to
think
about
groovy
butterflies
with
red
and
purple
and
yellow
and
violet
whispers
in
the
dark
backward
uprising
theme
of
the
way
it
really
was
in
the
thunder
of
the
goat
farm
with
lots
of
yams
and
a
shovelful
of
fine
white
powder
that
looked
like
the
side
of
a
barn
with
lots
of
clocks
and
fleas
with
orange
earrings
in
their
hazy
green
and
blue
and
pink
which
were
married
to
some
tortilla
chips
and
about
orange
and
brown
with
green
feathers
and
pink
fur
chapter
fourteen
graham
sat
down
upon
the
ground
and
sighed
he
was
glad
to
have
escaped
from
the
wicked
witch
yet
again
but
he
felt
sorry
for
his
companion
he
wondered
what
that
awful
old
woman
might
have
done
to
poor
telly
could
she
have
locked
him
away
in
a
torture
chamber
someplace
some
terrible
winding
maze
such
as
he
had
just
left
it
made
him
feel
sick
to
even
imagine
it
he
absently
sat
and
drew
a
picture
of
telly
in
the
dirt
where
are
you
telly
he
asked
aloud
he
spoke
his
question
into
the
air
and
no
answer
seemed
to
be
forthcoming
what
has
she
done
to
you
i
have
to
know
i
miss
you
telly
you
are
my
best
friend
in
this
strange
land
i
love
you
where
have
you
been
taken
who
is
telly
came
an
unfamiliar
female
voice
graham
turned
about
to
see
who
had
spoken
he
was
looking
as
much
into
the
sun
as
into
the
face
of
the
speaker
it
was
hard
to
distinguish
her
features
but
she
looked
like
a
fine
white
horse
hello
said
graham
uncertainly
hello
replied
the
voice
whoever
she
was
she
sounded
gentle
and
understanding
my
name
is
why
are
you
so
glum
my
friend
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
a
bad
witch
explained
the
boy
who
felt
an
inexplicable
trust
for
this
equine
newcomer
oh
she
replied
i
am
sorry
i
had
thought
that
queen
ozma
had
done
away
with
all
such
vile
witches
well
he
sighed
she
does
know
about
this
one
this
wicked
old
witch
has
created
a
very
clever
illusion
that
has
made
ozma
unable
to
see
her
or
to
find
out
about
her
i
was
fooled
too
i
had
been
under
the
impression
that
ozma
was
as
wicked
as
the
witch
but
i
was
wrong
if
only
i
could
find
ozma
the
real
ozma
not
just
an
illusion
that
was
passing
itself
off
as
the
real
ozma
then
i
could
tell
her
what
was
going
on
if
all
that
the
woozy
told
me
is
true
the
real
ozma
would
be
able
to
make
things
right
again
as
it
is
i
ca
help
telly
and
i
can
never
go
home
to
america
again
either
the
horse
nestled
down
beside
the
boy
only
then
did
he
realize
that
this
was
no
normal
horse
that
was
speaking
to
him
she
was
different
from
all
horses
in
all
graham
experience
she
was
as
pure
white
as
the
driven
snow
and
her
mane
was
a
shiny
silver
from
the
top
of
her
head
grew
a
long
beautiful
horn
wow
exclaimed
graham
are
you
a
real
unicorn
so
i
been
told
laughed
but
i
am
a
long
way
from
my
home
just
like
you
are
i
left
that
area
because
the
other
unicorns
did
seem
to
understand
my
views
on
things
they
thought
i
was
strange
and
that
i
was
not
worthy
of
the
name
of
the
unicorns
but
i
can
not
help
what
i
am
i
yearn
to
see
all
that
there
is
to
see
of
this
land
of
oz
in
which
i
live
and
i
wanted
to
find
someone
who
could
understand
my
philosophies
too
none
of
the
stallions
of
my
breed
took
me
seriously
and
i
have
never
once
felt
true
love
at
least
not
until
i
met
macdonald
lindsay
who
is
that
wondered
graham
well
i
have
actually
met
him
in
person
she
admitted
but
i
overheard
him
talking
to
his
helpers
one
day
he
was
telling
them
about
the
need
for
all
sentient
beings
to
have
a
purpose
in
life
no
one
can
be
fulfilled
if
he
is
not
in
some
way
making
his
existence
count
for
anything
he
himself
is
in
control
of
the
finest
dairy
farm
in
oz
he
has
vast
fields
of
milkweed
that
his
helpers
harvest
for
him
in
exchange
for
their
housing
food
and
the
occasional
game
of
quoits
that
sounds
fair
i
suppose
replied
graham
realizing
that
this
group
was
not
one
which
was
accustomed
to
using
any
form
of
money
very
much
so
she
said
and
the
helpers
a
unique
tribe
of
amphibians
known
as
wartfrogs
are
highly
contented
with
their
lot
macdonald
lindsay
allows
them
to
come
and
go
as
they
please
and
he
has
given
each
of
them
a
home
that
is
far
more
luxurious
than
his
own
little
lodging
actually
macdonald
farm
is
the
only
thing
he
has
that
is
luxurious
his
personal
abode
is
a
simple
cleft
in
a
rock
that
you
can
see
from
here
in
that
little
hill
she
pointed
with
her
horn
i
see
it
said
graham
this
macdonald
fellow
sounds
like
a
good
enough
guy
oh
he
is
very
good
said
but
very
mysterious
i
have
not
had
any
real
opportunity
to
ask
him
but
i
think
i
could
be
very
happy
working
in
his
fields
alongside
the
wartfrogs
have
you
ever
tried
to
go
to
him
to
ask
for
a
job
questioned
graham
no
but
i
have
been
in
his
fields
indeed
his
milkweed
is
the
best
in
all
the
land
it
is
not
just
an
ordinary
product
it
is
special
it
is
chocolate
milkweed
and
it
is
as
smooth
as
chinese
silk
i
have
been
following
the
wartfrogs
and
sneaking
an
occasional
taste
of
any
chocolate
milkweed
pods
that
they
overlooked
i
see
said
graham
you
are
welcome
to
have
dinner
with
me
said
i
have
at
least
a
pods
that
i
am
willing
to
share
with
you
it
was
at
that
point
that
graham
remembered
how
long
it
had
been
since
last
he
had
eaten
even
then
he
was
not
sure
the
food
had
been
anything
more
than
an
illusion
conjured
up
by
the
witch
it
was
not
more
than
a
second
before
he
heard
himself
accepting
the
invitation
indeed
the
chocolate
milkweed
was
the
most
delicious
thing
graham
had
ever
tasted
he
thanked
over
and
over
for
sharing
this
delightful
new
with
him
he
and
the
unicorn
talked
for
a
long
while
afterward
he
was
not
sure
just
how
long
it
was
but
he
awoke
the
next
morning
feeling
quite
refreshed
the
unicorn
had
already
gone
on
her
way
but
she
had
left
a
note
for
graham
explaining
that
she
had
gone
to
watch
the
wartfrogs
in
macdonald
lindsay
fields
as
was
her
usual
morning
activity
the
note
informed
him
that
she
would
seek
him
out
later
that
afternoon
if
he
cared
to
stay
in
the
vicinity
and
that
she
was
happy
to
have
met
him
should
he
choose
to
move
on
illustration
after
thinking
it
over
graham
decided
that
he
was
going
to
need
help
if
he
planned
to
rescue
poor
telly
from
the
false
allidap
hence
he
decided
to
wait
for
he
could
spend
the
day
formulating
a
plan
that
would
allow
them
to
get
telly
away
from
the
witch
without
endangering
their
own
lives
macdonald
lindsay
was
a
fellow
who
was
in
high
position
on
his
farm
yet
he
gave
all
of
the
finest
of
his
yield
to
others
he
was
a
man
who
had
few
needs
only
the
knowledge
that
his
crops
were
bringing
happiness
to
others
that
was
all
he
had
ever
asked
yet
there
was
something
missing
in
his
life
something
upon
which
he
could
not
place
a
finger
yes
indeed
macdonald
lindsay
had
fingers
three
of
them
on
each
hand
in
fact
he
was
a
powerful
and
muscular
troll
for
all
intents
and
purposes
that
is
he
was
from
the
waist
up
from
his
waist
down
instead
of
the
usual
troll
waist
and
legs
however
he
had
the
neck
and
body
of
a
mighty
black
stallion
anyone
born
under
the
astrological
sign
of
sagittarius
might
recognize
him
as
a
relation
to
the
centaur
but
macdonald
lindsay
claimed
no
such
heritage
formally
lambert
he
said
putting
a
beefy
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
one
of
his
workers
who
happened
to
be
a
foreman
among
the
wartfrogs
yeah
asked
the
amphibian
who
is
the
little
unicorn
the
one
i
see
out
there
in
my
fields
i
have
seen
her
other
times
too
i
know
no
name
for
her
sighed
the
wartfrog
my
boys
and
i
have
seen
her
before
though
she
only
takes
a
few
pods
and
only
those
extreme
few
that
my
boys
do
consider
worthy
of
picking
or
trading
in
your
name
those
that
she
takes
are
all
too
small
or
have
already
been
picked
over
by
the
crows
we
had
once
considered
making
a
scarecrow
an
inanimate
one
of
course
not
like
the
guy
who
usually
comes
to
mind
when
we
think
of
scarecrows
but
that
little
unicorn
seems
to
get
what
she
needs
from
our
leftovers
so
no
one
has
bothered
to
send
her
on
her
way
so
she
only
takes
that
which
is
rejected
from
my
farm
replied
macdonald
doubtfully
illustration
well
began
the
worker
please
do
be
angry
with
me
there
have
been
a
couple
of
occasions
that
i
have
taken
pity
on
the
poor
creature
and
left
a
few
better
pods
for
her
to
find
please
do
get
angry
sir
i
only
did
it
because
i
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
little
thing
she
looked
so
hungry
and
we
have
so
much
within
minutes
the
mighty
man
was
looking
into
the
eyes
of
the
young
unicorn
i
i
sorry
to
intrude
on
your
farm
she
said
tremblingly
listen
my
dear
he
said
you
are
welcome
in
my
fields
any
time
you
wish
to
be
here
you
are
welcome
to
take
any
milkweed
you
want
or
to
help
yourself
to
any
of
my
other
crops
i
have
asked
my
wartfrogs
to
ignore
you
you
no
longer
need
to
feel
like
an
intruder
you
are
very
kind
she
replied
you
know
that
i
am
not
from
around
here
i
am
not
understood
amongst
my
own
kind
so
i
am
something
of
an
outcast
you
might
say
not
here
you
not
thank
you
sir
the
unicorn
seemed
to
be
near
tears
thank
you
so
much
when
returned
to
the
little
clearing
where
she
had
left
graham
she
brought
him
several
milkweed
pods
as
well
as
a
few
cookies
she
had
picked
from
the
bushes
around
the
base
of
macdonald
rock
he
is
very
sweet
she
said
the
moment
i
saw
his
eyes
i
knew
that
he
was
special
graham
do
you
believe
in
love
at
first
sight
i
do
know
he
said
to
her
but
i
sure
do
love
these
cookies
and
so
it
went
for
the
next
day
and
the
next
by
day
went
to
the
fields
where
she
grew
more
and
more
fond
of
the
odd
stallion
there
by
night
she
plotted
with
graham
as
to
how
they
might
go
about
locating
telly
the
problem
seemed
to
be
that
the
witch
could
have
magically
zapped
him
off
as
far
away
as
santa
monica
california
had
she
wanted
to
do
so
finding
him
would
not
be
an
easy
task
to
make
matters
worse
poor
had
become
a
tad
too
taken
with
macdonald
lindsay
the
wartfrogs
had
begun
to
mistrust
her
illustration
she
is
even
the
same
kind
of
animal
said
lambert
the
wartfrog
leader
she
does
have
any
troll
features
not
even
a
little
around
the
eyes
they
are
totally
incompatible
she
must
only
be
out
to
get
his
milkweed
to
think
that
i
once
felt
sympathy
for
that
wretched
little
unicorn
why
that
cunning
little
crook
even
has
lindsay
entranced
so
much
that
he
has
begun
giving
her
some
of
the
good
stuff
she
is
no
longer
contented
with
the
scraps
and
rejects
of
our
fields
she
has
got
to
go
but
how
shall
we
do
it
it
will
have
to
be
handled
in
a
sneaky
enough
way
so
as
to
keep
lindsay
from
noticing
he
has
been
placed
under
the
spell
of
that
little
siren
and
i
know
that
he
would
never
grant
us
permission
to
shove
her
away
from
the
area
it
was
the
very
next
day
that
the
wartfrogs
made
their
move
under
the
direction
of
lambert
they
went
about
their
work
and
it
was
business
as
usual
then
when
one
of
the
amphibious
pigs
saw
the
small
unicorn
in
the
field
behind
them
lambert
called
for
a
halt
the
wartfrogs
turned
around
and
went
back
toward
she
was
not
looking
in
their
direction
so
she
did
not
notice
that
they
were
coming
toward
her
until
it
was
too
late
to
escape
they
were
already
upon
her
and
hurled
her
unceremoniously
into
a
this
they
tossed
onto
their
cart
and
carried
away
i
will
sell
her
to
a
zoo
in
some
other
land
where
they
are
not
so
kind
to
thieving
giggled
lambert
showing
his
teeth
now
we
can
get
rid
of
this
little
troublemaker
once
and
for
all
old
will
never
know
what
became
of
his
dear
little
indeed
it
would
have
been
curtains
for
poor
had
not
graham
had
a
sudden
inspiration
which
he
wanted
to
tell
her
about
right
away
he
felt
certain
that
he
had
formulated
a
plan
by
which
they
would
be
able
to
save
telly
from
the
witch
and
he
had
run
into
the
milkweed
fields
to
find
her
he
had
seen
the
terrible
wartfrogs
capture
her
and
had
even
overheard
what
they
planned
to
do
to
her
i
ca
let
them
do
it
he
whispered
angrily
why
this
is
the
second
time
i
made
a
friend
in
oz
who
has
met
with
foul
play
he
would
have
cried
had
his
sadness
not
been
so
highly
overcompensated
for
by
his
anger
his
first
instinct
was
to
run
to
her
and
try
to
fight
for
her
freedom
but
he
was
a
wise
enough
boy
to
know
full
well
that
this
would
be
folly
he
was
no
more
than
one
little
boy
against
a
whole
farm
worth
of
strong
and
muscular
laborers
if
he
were
to
pick
a
fight
with
this
bunch
he
would
be
sold
alongside
his
friend
no
he
would
need
another
plan
of
rescue
but
he
had
already
come
up
with
one
such
plan
now
he
could
give
it
a
however
he
knew
that
he
could
not
hope
to
carry
it
out
all
by
himself
no
he
would
have
to
have
help
and
graham
knew
from
whence
that
help
must
come
with
a
swallow
of
anxiety
he
headed
for
the
home
of
the
ranchero
macdonald
lindsay
was
as
amiable
a
fellow
as
the
unicorn
had
said
this
fact
instantly
put
graham
anxiety
to
rest
do
come
in
my
friend
said
the
ranchero
what
can
i
do
to
make
you
happy
illustration
it
about
said
graham
that
poor
little
waif
of
a
unicorn
replied
the
that
very
one
said
graham
your
workers
have
taken
her
prisoner
and
they
plan
to
sell
her
to
a
zoo
or
a
circus
or
something
like
that
the
troll
creature
looked
at
graham
and
frowned
then
he
began
to
laugh
ha
ha
he
said
you
take
me
for
a
complete
and
utter
idiot
no
you
can
not
be
telling
me
the
truth
my
boys
are
under
orders
to
let
the
lovely
little
waif
alone
they
would
not
do
such
a
cruel
or
vile
thing
to
anyone
i
assure
you
but
i
was
there
sir
pleaded
graham
i
saw
it
all
with
my
own
two
eyes
they
put
into
a
great
big
and
hid
her
on
a
cart
that
they
carried
along
behind
them
the
big
fat
one
said
he
was
going
to
sell
her
to
a
zoo
i
heard
him
say
so
he
said
will
never
know
what
became
of
his
little
as
he
quoted
the
line
he
did
his
best
to
imitate
the
wartfrog
voice
please
lindsay
you
just
have
to
believe
me
i
telling
you
the
truth
now
now
answered
the
troll
voice
which
was
sounding
less
patient
than
before
i
know
better
no
one
on
my
staff
would
ever
do
such
a
thing
and
no
one
on
my
staff
would
ever
wait
a
minute
did
you
say
my
my
only
foreman
lambert
ever
called
me
by
that
annoying
name
and
no
one
but
he
would
have
the
audacity
to
his
heart
pounded
so
loudly
that
graham
could
hear
it
from
across
the
room
then
the
let
out
a
couple
of
loud
exclamations
merciful
frances
of
grand
rapids
minnesota
he
bellowed
judy
in
the
sky
what
a
fool
i
have
been
to
overlook
it
lambert
has
been
trying
to
hide
it
from
me
but
he
has
been
showing
signs
of
resentment
against
that
unicorn
i
should
have
seen
this
coming
but
you
have
opened
my
eyes
my
boy
i
have
strived
er
striven
er
i
have
always
made
it
my
strivence
in
these
fields
to
ensure
that
every
visiting
child
and
family
successfully
explores
his
own
particular
creative
abilities
i
had
seen
so
many
fine
qualities
of
leadership
in
foreman
lambert
that
i
closed
my
eyes
to
his
darker
side
but
i
can
no
longer
look
the
other
way
it
may
not
be
kosher
but
i
am
going
to
have
to
fight
against
my
own
man
the
ranchero
started
angrily
for
the
door
wait
shouted
graham
taking
on
the
role
of
the
calm
and
collected
boy
with
a
plan
wait
for
what
asked
lindsay
i
wait
for
nothing
until
i
see
that
lousy
lambert
get
his
just
rewards
he
will
spoke
the
boy
yes
but
not
that
way
what
if
you
try
to
fight
all
of
those
thugs
at
once
you
just
be
outnumbered
i
have
a
better
idea
i
know
of
a
way
to
save
without
anyone
getting
hurt
then
spill
it
my
boy
what
is
this
plan
foreman
lambert
took
the
rest
of
the
day
off
he
carefully
researched
the
best
place
to
sell
a
captured
unicorn
he
planned
to
get
enough
wealth
to
buy
the
entire
farm
and
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
sipping
strawberry
daiquiris
and
conversing
with
macdonald
lindsay
about
the
joys
of
being
affluent
as
he
sat
and
pored
over
the
pages
of
encyclopedia
of
places
where
unicorns
can
be
successfully
sold
on
the
black
market
with
no
questions
asked
except
when
the
salesman
happens
to
be
a
mangaboo
vol
he
heard
a
peculiar
clattering
noise
outside
fearing
it
might
affect
his
own
happiness
in
some
way
lambert
ran
outside
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
sight
that
met
his
eyes
was
hardly
what
he
would
have
expected
there
before
him
was
a
huge
ox
tethered
to
a
wagon
one
wheel
had
fallen
from
the
wagon
and
the
wagonmaster
was
jumping
up
and
down
shouting
angry
expletives
at
the
ox
you
filthy
pile
of
oxtail
soup
shouted
the
young
man
you
are
as
able
to
locate
the
proper
roads
as
dorothy
was
in
road
to
now
just
look
what
your
lack
of
brains
has
caused
us
you
dragged
us
off
the
road
and
now
we
have
another
busted
wheel
to
bother
about
you
are
just
a
lousy
old
coot
now
now
said
lambert
you
need
speak
so
unkindly
to
this
fine
animal
i
be
happy
to
take
him
off
your
hands
if
he
such
a
a
coot
i
think
you
said
yeah
begged
the
ox
let
him
have
me
i
can
work
on
this
big
farm
not
a
chance
blurted
the
human
i
need
a
to
pull
this
wagon
if
i
had
another
animal
maybe
a
horse
or
a
pony
i
gladly
unload
your
crummy
old
worthless
hide
in
a
heartbeat
but
such
beasts
are
sure
to
be
expensive
in
these
parts
especially
to
a
stranger
like
me
and
all
i
have
are
these
diamonds
a
bag
of
square
emeralds
and
a
couple
of
rubies
to
spare
lambert
lit
up
and
became
more
alert
than
he
had
ever
been
before
standing
straight
up
and
trying
to
look
as
businesslike
as
a
wartfrog
can
possibly
look
he
said
that
is
the
exact
price
i
planned
to
ask
for
a
very
pretty
unicorn
that
i
have
recently
acquired
by
perfectly
legitimate
means
are
there
any
other
kind
asked
the
stranger
with
a
sly
wink
of
course
not
he
ran
inside
to
the
closet
and
grabbed
the
bag
with
inside
coming
back
to
his
customer
he
handed
it
over
and
greedily
grabbed
the
precious
gemstones
thank
you
oh
thank
you
he
squealed
gleefully
and
can
i
get
that
ox
too
you
can
get
me
all
right
said
the
ox
but
i
not
sure
you
want
what
comes
with
me
stepping
toward
the
wartfrog
and
ramming
his
face
against
one
of
lambert
tough
tusks
which
consequently
broke
off
and
fell
to
the
ground
he
broke
off
what
became
obviously
a
papier
maché
mask
beneath
it
he
was
actually
the
owner
of
the
whole
ranch
macdonald
lindsay
oh
oh
gasped
lambert
er
hi
master
i
knew
it
was
you
all
along
that
is
why
i
went
along
with
your
silly
little
game
had
it
been
anyone
but
you
i
not
have
left
my
work
for
a
moment
to
play
such
a
game
but
no
harm
done
right
here
take
these
little
gemstones
away
i
do
really
need
them
all
part
of
the
game
though
you
know
well
i
do
have
work
to
do
now
lambert
roared
the
troll
in
a
voice
that
would
have
shamed
the
kingliest
of
lions
you
have
no
work
to
do
here
oh
but
i
do
said
lambert
i
must
take
this
darling
unicorn
back
to
where
she
belongs
oh
yes
yes
please
do
not
hinder
us
i
must
get
her
away
from
here
where
she
is
such
a
lovely
distraction
yeah
exactly
the
problem
my
master
got
ta
get
her
home
now
later
the
troll
placed
a
powerful
and
majestic
hoof
on
one
of
flippers
excuse
me
he
said
but
i
told
you
that
you
have
no
further
work
to
do
here
please
pick
up
your
toys
and
get
off
of
my
ranch
and
take
your
disobedient
helpers
with
you
also
you
may
have
as
many
milkweed
pods
as
you
can
carry
i
never
let
it
be
said
that
i
am
heartless
but
master
stammered
lambert
you
ca
do
this
you
must
come
such
a
long
way
already
i
was
up
for
a
raise
next
year
i
raise
a
few
things
for
you
if
you
are
out
of
my
sight
before
nightfall
lindsay
was
suddenly
calm
and
if
i
ever
see
you
around
this
innocent
waif
again
i
will
well
i
do
rightly
know
what
i
do
but
you
can
rest
assured
that
it
wo
be
very
much
fun
for
either
of
us
chapter
fifteen
ca
stand
in
the
way
of
love
well
now
cackled
the
witch
you
thought
you
seen
the
last
of
allidap
did
you
you
were
so
wrong
ha
ha
ha
now
i
have
you
in
my
clutches
once
more
and
you
wo
be
escaping
from
me
again
i
can
tell
you
to
think
you
tried
to
trick
me
with
a
photo
of
some
television
star
but
you
wo
be
able
to
fool
me
again
quite
so
easily
my
little
basket
of
nuts
and
bolts
the
evil
woman
had
chained
telly
to
a
large
black
platform
and
was
standing
over
him
in
a
most
menacing
manner
you
showed
me
a
picture
of
somebody
else
to
make
me
think
i
was
a
ravishing
beauty
you
lied
to
me
you
electronic
hunk
of
junk
telly
struggled
to
free
himself
of
his
chains
but
they
proved
to
be
too
strong
for
him
giving
in
he
stopped
struggling
and
tuned
in
to
an
old
rerun
of
disney
wonderful
world
of
let
me
see
now
muttered
the
false
allidap
i
must
think
this
over
i
have
to
do
something
appropriate
to
punish
you
for
your
deceptive
ways
maybe
i
should
turn
you
into
a
candy
cane
and
gobble
you
up
she
scratched
her
chin
no
that
would
be
much
too
kind
i
must
think
of
a
punishment
that
is
more
fitting
to
a
rotten
mean
liar
such
as
you
happen
to
be
hmmm
maybe
i
could
transform
you
into
a
little
brown
wart
on
the
left
foot
of
a
slimy
old
toad
or
a
bucket
of
rotten
peas
but
that
still
seems
hardly
enough
punishment
for
a
creepy
little
crawler
like
you
oooh
of
all
the
disgusting
luck
if
i
had
only
been
manifested
with
the
ability
to
read
then
i
could
find
a
perfectly
lovely
little
spell
to
cast
on
you
that
would
satisfy
my
need
to
punish
you
she
stalked
to
a
nearby
shelf
which
was
covered
with
various
bottles
of
herbs
and
tinctures
each
of
these
had
a
faded
yellowing
label
but
none
of
these
labels
did
her
any
good
it
became
clear
to
her
that
the
inability
to
read
was
indeed
a
great
setback
as
she
pondered
an
appropriate
course
of
action
she
heard
a
rustling
sound
outside
what
is
that
annoying
noise
she
spat
maybe
your
little
pal
graham
has
come
to
let
me
capture
him
as
well
i
will
make
short
work
of
him
let
me
tell
you
he
was
a
fool
to
come
here
she
stepped
lively
to
the
door
and
stamped
her
way
outside
okay
little
boy
she
called
i
know
that
you
are
out
here
someplace
come
on
out
of
hiding
trying
to
trick
me
will
only
make
it
worse
on
yourself
come
to
me
quietly
and
let
us
get
this
messy
ordeal
over
with
quickly
being
that
you
are
so
fond
of
reading
oz
books
i
think
i
will
turn
you
into
a
copy
of
and
the
wizard
in
then
as
a
book
does
me
no
good
i
will
toss
you
into
my
fireplace
and
watch
you
burn
there
was
no
reply
i
see
sighed
the
witch
so
you
want
to
make
things
difficult
do
you
well
i
am
willing
to
go
along
with
your
silly
little
game
of
but
just
remember
my
fine
and
dandy
little
gentleman
that
once
i
do
find
you
i
will
not
be
so
lenient
on
your
crummy
hiding
little
hide
as
she
searched
the
scraggly
brush
that
surrounded
her
home
she
grew
more
and
more
agitated
you
may
be
a
pretty
good
hider
she
bellowed
but
i
get
you
in
the
end
you
just
wait
and
see
she
searched
for
a
solid
half
hour
before
she
decided
that
graham
was
not
to
be
found
the
little
fruitcake
must
have
run
off
in
fear
and
horror
she
determined
well
i
will
concern
myself
with
his
punishment
some
other
time
right
now
i
have
the
television
set
to
attend
to
i
will
miss
my
soaps
but
i
think
it
high
time
i
put
that
nasty
old
creep
in
his
proper
place
i
think
i
make
him
into
a
nice
bowl
of
lumpy
oatmeal
and
have
him
for
a
snack
so
saying
she
sauntered
back
into
her
home
once
inside
she
was
met
with
a
sight
that
made
her
more
angry
than
ever
there
on
either
side
of
the
platform
which
held
telly
captive
were
the
two
huge
the
cowardly
lion
was
trying
in
vain
to
unshackle
telly
chains
the
hungry
tiger
who
had
been
standing
guard
saw
the
enemy
and
instantly
prepared
to
spring
on
her
you
better
leave
us
alone
you
yucky
old
witch
growled
the
tiger
threateningly
we
are
taking
telly
to
the
real
emerald
city
to
meet
the
real
queen
ozma
once
ozma
hears
what
been
up
to
she
transport
you
to
some
place
where
you
can
never
cause
our
beloved
land
of
oz
any
further
grief
is
that
so
chuckled
the
witch
quickly
regaining
her
bearings
like
to
see
the
stumbling
demented
child
queen
try
that
maybe
i
should
turn
her
into
a
toadstool
to
show
you
that
i
am
the
one
here
your
foolish
little
girl
is
no
queen
she
just
a
flimsy
excuse
for
a
bad
in
fact
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
to
her
i
think
i
should
enjoy
making
her
into
a
little
sugar
cube
and
drinking
her
in
my
tea
but
first
i
think
i
should
take
care
of
you
little
kitty
cats
i
have
heard
a
story
about
a
little
brat
named
sambo
who
made
some
tigers
into
butter
i
think
this
tawny
scrawny
beast
would
be
a
fine
spread
for
my
toast
yes
i
think
that
should
be
quite
delicious
and
the
little
lion
could
become
the
toast
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
eat
the
two
of
you
together
the
lion
was
visibly
shaken
by
this
idea
i
want
to
be
he
bellowed
fearfully
and
i
will
not
become
a
pat
of
butter
either
added
the
tiger
quickly
springing
on
the
antagonist
and
knocking
her
over
the
witch
struggled
for
a
few
minutes
and
finally
freed
herself
only
to
be
knocked
over
a
second
time
by
the
lion
who
had
summoned
up
a
few
grams
of
courage
in
just
the
nick
of
time
you
pestery
creatures
she
blurted
you
filthy
rotten
haggard
beasts
of
bumbling
stumbling
stupidity
i
will
see
you
both
destroyed
and
i
laugh
about
it
you
rotten
dirty
crummy
hateful
old
things
summoning
in
her
rage
a
strength
she
had
never
before
known
she
hurled
the
lion
on
top
of
the
tiger
then
grabbing
a
huge
net
she
threw
it
over
the
two
of
them
before
they
had
any
time
to
move
out
of
the
way
now
i
have
you
all
my
dearies
all
three
of
that
foolish
kid
friendies
and
i
see
you
all
into
your
demises
right
now
the
witch
said
in
a
whisper
she
was
about
to
carry
out
this
threat
when
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
oh
drat
it
all
said
the
witch
who
could
that
be
if
it
your
silly
i
allow
him
the
honor
of
watching
me
destroy
all
of
the
rest
of
you
she
went
to
the
door
there
she
saw
a
strange
creature
looking
at
her
and
wearing
a
painted
smile
on
his
face
what
the
dickens
are
you
she
said
you
look
a
little
bit
like
a
troll
but
you
have
a
horse
body
growing
out
of
your
waist
i
am
a
sort
of
he
replied
but
that
is
not
important
right
now
what
is
important
is
that
this
may
be
your
lucky
day
my
lucky
what
asked
the
witch
not
quite
understanding
is
this
the
home
of
bastinda
slinky
myrna
evillene
allidap
asked
the
stranger
er
i
guess
so
replied

he
turned
around
and
whistled
through
his
teeth
oh

she
here

in
the
cameras
a
small
creature
and
a
young
man
with
a
television

place
of
a
head

running
up
oh

camerahead
let
get
some
good
footage
of
our
lucky

her
home
let

inside
it
will
look
more
natural
if
our
winner
is
in
a
comfortable
place
on
her
sofa
but
began
the
witch
but
i
did
even
know
there
was
a
tv
station
in
oz
well
of
course
there
is
said
the
horse
where
else
would
ozites
turn
to
see
their
favorite
oz
cartoon
episodes
we
are
broadcasting
from
the
peak
of
some
summit
now
come
on
be
lively
about
this
we
have
got
all
day
we
have
a
commercial
to
shoot
for
newspaper
at
ten
after
three
illustration
why
do
you
stand
here
in
front
of
your
television
set
suggested
the
camera
man
but
we
have
to
unchain
it
from
this
thing
here
this
wo
look
pleasing
to
our
television
audience
no
raged
the
fake
allidap
leave
that
alone
but
the
camera
man
who
had
come
equipped
with
some
metal
clippers
had
telly
freed
in
no
time
at
all
now
my
dear
allidap
said
the
centaur
please
stand
still
and
try
to
look
surprised
if
this
all
goes
well
you
may
be
eligible
for
an
all
expense
paid
trip
to
walt
disney
world
in
tampa
florida
that
in
the
united
states
you
know
so
it
may
be
possible
for
you
to
meet
the
president
and
give
him
any
advice
you
might
have
for
him
but
hey
stuttered
the
witch
you
want
him
to
butt
some
hay
said
the
horse
i
think
i
rather
eat
it
than
butt
it
but
to
each
his
own
i
think
we
need
some
extra
color
in
this
place
it
looks
too
gloomy
she
picked
up
a
bucket
which
had
been
carried
in
by
the
centaur
in
her
teeth
and
began
to
splash
some
paint
all
about
the
room
some
of
which
went
directly
into
the
witch
eyes
allidap
tried
to
cry
out
in
rage
but
she
only
got
some
paint
in
her
mouth
this
looks
great
said
the
camera
man
the
color
really
adds
a
lot
the
people
watching
will
be
happier
to
see
it
than
the
gloominess
that
used
to
be
here
now
let
me
see
let
have
some
creative
banter
allidap
can
you
look
excited
and
happy
come
on
let
see
that
beautiful
smile
yes
added
the
centaur
and
hop
up
and
down
screaming
won
i
won
if
you
think
you
can
handle
it
the
witch
was
having
trouble
following
all
of
this
especially
with
the
paint
in
her
eyes
that
made
it
impossible
to
see
anything
around
her
but
she
did
like
the
thought
of
having
won
something
so
she
did
her
best
to
do
as
they
asked
when
they
seemed
satisfied
with
their
tv
footage
they
bid
her
a
fond
adieu
and
scurried
out
the
door
once
a
good
distance
from
the
witch
home
the
camera
man
took
off
his
mask
of
course
as
you
may
have
already
guessed
it
was
actually
graham
in
disguise
and
with
him
were
macdonald
lindsay
and
the
plan
had
worked
and
they
had
rescued
not
only
telly
but
also
the
cowardly
lion
and
the
hungry
tiger
as
well
i
want
to
thank
you
said
telly
for
coming
to
our
rescue
that
way
that
was
a
clever
trick
making
the
witch
think
you
were
there
to
put
her
on
television
i
would
have
actually
wanted
to
televise
an
image
of
her
as
it
might
damage
my
picture
tube
but
it
worked
the
cowardly
lion
and
the
hungry
tiger
thanked
them
as
well
i
think
we
should
be
looking
for
the
real
ozma
said
graham
the
witch
will
eventually
be
out
hunting
me
down
again
a
good
thought
agreed
the
hungry
tiger
we
shall
go
and
find
her
straightaway
the
centaur
looked
solemn
i
would
so
love
to
meet
our
dear
ruler
he
said
but
i
fear
i
may
be
in
for
a
rude
visit
from
those
wartfrogs
and
i
think
i
should
be
there
when
it
comes
to
pass
however
i
will
join
you
in
the
emerald
city
as
soon
as
i
have
sent
the
wartfrogs
away
for
good
i
will
be
sorry
to
be
apart
from
this
dear
unicorn
however
we
have
been
talking
and
we
agree
that
we
belong
together
i
will
be
anxiously
looking
forward
to
seeing
her
again
very
soon
no
replied
i
shall
come
back
to
the
farm
and
help
you
to
rid
yourself
of
those
former
employees
of
yours
then
we
shall
travel
together
to
the
emerald
city
this
was
a
sad
parting
for
all
after
all
of
the
adventures
they
had
shared
together
but
it
was
as
it
had
to
be
so
they
all
said
their
and
parted
and
the
two
creatures
headed
in
one
direction
and
the
four
mismatched
friends
in
the
other
chapter
sixteen
a
story
with
a
happy
ending
the
four
friends
had
reached
a
clearing
behind
which
a
clump
of
trees
partially
camouflaged
a
quaint
little
cottage
by
this
time
graham
was
feeling
quite
thirsty
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
knock
on
the
cottage
door
and
see
if
he
could
obtain
a
nice
drink
of
water
the
cottage
was
surrounded
by
a
garden
full
of
flowers
and
a
white
picket
fence
and
it
was
all
so
pretty
it
could
have
come
right
out
of
a
fairy
tale
graham
knew
full
well
that
no
evil
person
could
possibly
reside
in
such
a
picturesque
place
so
he
boldly
opened
the
gate
and
walked
along
the
little
winding
path
to
the
front
door
where
he
knocked
loudly
a
minute
went
by
with
no
response
whereupon
graham
knocked
again
but
this
time
quite
a
bit
louder
why
do
you
just
knock
my
door
down
said
a
voice
behind
him
graham
about
jumped
out
of
his
skin
as
he
spun
around
to
see
a
very
kindly
lady
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
approaching
from
the
back
of
the
house
i
was
pruning
my
roses
in
the
back
garden
she
continued
when
i
heard
what
i
thought
must
be
a
very
rude
person
banging
on
my
front
door
i
gather
you
must
be
here
on
a
very
urgent
matter
well
not
exactly
graham
said
rather
sheepishly
i
was
feeling
very
thirsty
and
thought
that
perhaps
i
might
be
able
to
obtain
a
drink
of
water
hmmm
i
think
that
can
be
arranged
replied
the
lady
and
what
about
your
friends
she
asked
looking
rather
curiously
at
telly
and
a
little
nervously
at
the
lion
and
tiger
oh
telly
here
is
an
person
and
is
not
very
partial
to
water
but
if
you
could
wipe
his
face
with
a
damp
cloth
he
not
only
look
better
and
be
able
to
see
better
but
i
be
able
to
see
his
television
programs
better
would
you
like
to
watch
one
now
illustration
the
lady
was
more
than
a
little
confused
by
this
invitation
but
she
obliged
by
spraying
some
glass
cleaning
liquid
on
telly
screen
and
wiping
it
with
a
dry
cloth
ouch
that
stuff
stings
my
eyes
telly
protested
loudly
but
he
was
happy
that
all
of
the
dust
had
been
removed
from
his
screen
how
about
the
lion
and
tiger
asked
the
lady
would
they
like
a
drink
they
do
bite
do
they
without
waiting
for
an
answer
the
lady
led
them
to
the
back
of
the
house
where
a
well
was
located
she
hauled
up
a
bucket
of
crystal
clear
water
which
graham
took
a
long
drink
of
from
a
ladle
which
she
handed
to
him
the
lion
and
tiger
said
they
were
not
thirsty
but
the
tiger
asked
politely
if
there
were
any
fat
babies
residing
with
her
graham
coughed
and
choked
as
the
water
went
down
the
wrong
way
fortunately
the
noise
drowned
out
the
question
and
the
lady
did
not
hear
him
with
his
thirst
more
than
satisfied
graham
proceeded
to
introduce
himself
and
did
his
best
to
explain
his
current
situation
and
unique
abilities
the
lady
replied
that
her
name
was
doré
and
that
she
was
both
an
artist
and
a
storyteller
she
then
went
into
the
house
and
brought
out
several
unique
pen
and
ink
drawings
as
well
as
some
beautiful
watercolors
which
everyone
greatly
admired
she
looked
intently
at
the
hungry
tiger
and
said
he
was
a
magnificent
animal
and
that
she
would
like
to
sketch
him
the
tiger
could
not
resist
smirking
at
the
lion
who
just
rolled
his
eyes
now
continued
doré
as
she
sketched
away
i
tell
you
one
of
my
stories
if
you
like
graham
and
his
friends
nodded
vigorously
after
all
they
all
loved
to
hear
stories
everyone
sat
down
on
the
soft
velvety
grass
by
the
well
as
doré
proceeded
to
tell
the
story
she
had
no
sooner
started
when
lots
of
little
animals
appeared
as
if
from
nowhere
and
gathered
around
to
listen
they
somehow
knew
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
from
the
lion
or
the
tiger
the
title
of
my
story
said
doré
is
smile
i
hope
you
like
it
today
was
a
special
day
not
only
because
the
sun
was
shining
but
because
he
felt
good
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
he
had
felt
so
good
he
sat
in
his
chair
on
the
porch
as
he
had
done
every
single
day
throughout
winter
summer
fall
and
his
favorite
time
of
the
year
spring
he
was
a
all
right
no
question
about
that
and
almost
everyone
in
town
had
to
pass
his
house
on
the
way
to
the
train
station
he
liked
that
he
knew
who
worked
in
the
city
who
was
late
and
who
went
in
early
you
could
tell
a
lot
about
people
by
the
schedules
they
kept
this
was
a
particularly
beautiful
day
fall
nipped
the
air
and
it
felt
crisp
to
the
skin
the
leaves
were
just
hinting
at
the
change
in
colors
he
liked
this
time
of
the
year
almost
as
much
as
he
liked
spring
the
heat
of
the
summer
had
a
way
of
sapping
a
man
strength
fall
was
different
there
was
something
about
the
cool
air
that
made
his
blood
surge
through
his
body
food
seemed
to
taste
better
and
the
air
smelted
especially
clean
the
women
seemed
to
look
prettier
than
ever
yes
sir
this
was
a
good
time
of
the
year
his
name
was
clive
and
he
was
only
years
old
he
had
never
really
lived
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
but
he
was
wise
beyond
his
years
people
always
waved
and
said
hi
to
him
but
few
approached
him
they
knew
he
was
a
handicapped
person
because
he
was
always
in
his
wheelchair
and
you
would
think
people
would
want
to
chat
and
be
cheerful
around
him
so
he
would
feel
good
but
few
ever
did
it
was
his
face
that
bothered
them
it
was
deformed
this
was
a
source
of
great
pain
to
his
mother
who
always
carried
a
cloak
of
guilt
about
her
his
eyes
were
set
very
far
apart
and
bulged
many
of
the
children
on
their
way
to
school
called
him
frog
they
shout
hey
hey
mr
frog
and
make
loud
croaking
sounds
they
never
knew
the
pain
it
caused
him
a
few
children
however
were
far
more
sensitive
and
loving
and
would
wave
and
smile
and
sometimes
come
right
up
to
him
and
say
hi
clive
how
are
you
today
this
made
him
feel
happy
again
clive
mouth
was
large
and
hung
loosely
at
the
ends
somehow
nature
had
forgotten
to
give
him
all
his
facial
muscles
for
all
his
many
emotions
his
face
only
reflected
one
to
watch
him
try
to
smile
was
painful
his
shriveled
body
was
even
sadder
to
observe
this
day
clive
sat
and
watched
helen
pass
by
he
thought
she
had
to
be
the
most
beautiful
person
in
the
world
surely
a
prettier
girl
could
not
exist
he
watched
her
intently
as
he
had
done
for
the
past
six
years
she
walked
by
and
did
not
look
his
way
as
usual
she
always
knew
he
was
there
she
had
sneaked
a
peak
at
him
once
and
was
so
repulsed
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
look
again
yet
she
knew
how
he
felt
about
her
she
could
feel
it
as
she
walked
by
at
first
she
felt
afraid
passing
by
she
even
tried
taking
a
different
route
to
the
station
but
after
a
while
she
felt
silly
so
she
passed
his
house
with
her
head
held
high
and
her
eyes
straight
ahead
as
the
years
passed
she
found
out
about
the
cripple
who
sat
on
his
porch
all
day
it
was
a
sad
story
apparently
the
father
could
cope
with
a
deformed
baby
so
he
deserted
the
family
the
mother
was
a
simple
she
was
forced
to
take
in
wash
and
to
clean
other
houses
but
she
managed
to
support
herself
and
her
deformed
child
she
was
a
quiet
woman
who
minded
her
own
business
she
rarely
spoke
but
she
could
polish
silver
and
furniture
like
no
other
person
and
so
she
had
plenty
of
work
in
time
she
was
able
to
afford
her
own
house
they
had
lived
in
that
house
on
mulberry
street
for
twenty
years
it
was
always
clean
and
neat
on
rare
occasions
helen
saw
the
mother
shopping
the
mother
was
so
thin
and
gaunt
how
did
she
manage
to
lift
that
son
of
hers
as
helen
passed
the
house
that
bright
fall
morning
she
wondered
if
the
man
could
stand
up
or
walk
helen
helen
you
look
so
pretty
today
the
young
woman
stopped
dead
in
her
tracks
who
spoke
she
looked
around
her
no
one
that
she
could
see
was
there
except
the
person
on
the
porch
was
it
him
no
it
could
be
she
had
heard
that
he
knew
how
to
speak
but
that
he
was
very
difficult
to
understand
but
this
voice
was
pleasant
and
articulate
very
masculine
too
someone
hiding
behind
a
bush
no
i
being
she
thought
must
have
imagined
she
looked
around
one
more
time
yet
carefully
avoiding
looking
at
the
figure
on
the
porch
helen
why
do
you
always
ignore
me
again
she
stopped
this
time
she
did
not
look
around
she
knew
yes
you
are
right
it
is
me
i
have
finally
gotten
up
enough
courage
to
talk
to
you
it
has
taken
me
years
ca
you
turn
around
just
this
once
and
smile
at
me
it
wo
hurt
you
you
are
so
lovely
more
lovely
than
even
the
moon
the
stars
and
all
the
flowers
in
the
world
today
i
am
going
to
die
yes
really
i
am
so
happy
it
is
such
a
special
day
i
knew
i
was
going
to
die
three
days
ago
and
i
prayed
to
god
that
before
i
died
i
could
just
see
helen
smile
he
gave
me
the
of
speaking
into
your
mind
for
just
this
one
special
day
and
he
promised
that
i
could
speak
articulately
if
what
i
said
came
from
the
heart
i
know
you
can
hear
me
please
i
love
you
so
much
wo
you
turn
and
smile
at
me
just
this
once
helen
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
she
knew
she
was
experiencing
something
abnormal
she
was
frightened
does
he
know
he
is
going
to
die
that
impossible
but
it
also
impossible
to
hear
a
voice
inside
your
head
and
i
know
i
hearing
it
oh
god
dare
i
do
it
can
i
look
at
him
he
so
ugly
so
unbearably
ugly
but
how
sad
it
was
a
beautiful
thing
he
said
to
me
what
if
i
do
smile
will
he
expect
me
to
smile
every
day
no
i
ca
do
that
next
he
ask
me
to
come
up
to
the
porch
and
chat
i
could
bear
it
i
could
yet
her
heart
went
out
to
him
loneliness
he
must
feel
i
smile
just
this
once
and
then
tomorrow
i
take
the
other
she
gathered
all
her
willpower
and
slowly
turned
around
smiling
at
that
moment
she
could
feel
a
tremendous
surge
of
love
radiate
towards
her
and
envelope
her
entire
being
the
sun
was
shining
so
brightly
that
it
momentarily
blinded
her
so
she
really
could
see
his
face
but
nevertheless
she
kept
smiling
for
a
moment
or
two
then
she
turned
and
continued
on
her
way
it
was
now
several
weeks
since
she
had
changed
her
route
by
now
she
was
convinced
that
she
had
only
imagined
the
voice
yet
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
walk
down
his
street
again
it
was
another
glorious
day
helen
had
the
day
off
and
was
going
shopping
she
was
standing
at
the
checkout
counter
when
she
felt
a
light
touch
on
her
arm
she
turned
and
drew
in
her
breath
it
was
his
mother
hello
said
the
mother
in
a
soft
voice
i
do
want
to
trouble
you
but
i
just
want
to
tell
you
something
i
promised
my
son
before
he
died
helen
heart
skipped
a
beat
he
died
yes
dear
he
died
several
weeks
ago
he
had
been
sitting
out
on
the
porch
as
usual
when
he
called
out
to
me
and
told
me
you
had
smiled
at
him
dear
you
made
him
so
happy
he
asked
me
to
tell
you
something
then
he
slumped
over
and
died
just
like
that
do
feel
sad
dear
it
was
a
blessing
he
did
not
believe
that
death
was
the
end
he
believed
that
he
would
receive
a
fine
new
body
what
did
he
say
the
mother
looked
up
at
her
the
most
pleasant
smile
crossing
her
face
he
said
to
thank
you
for
your
smile
and
to
tell
you
that
someday
he
will
meet
you
again
and
it
will
be
a
different
story
your
smile
made
his
life
worthwhile
and
he
died
a
very
very
happy
man
helen
felt
a
sadness
creeping
over
her
was
only
a
she
thought
i
am
sorry
i
did
smile
before
it
was
such
a
little
thing
for
me
to
give
but
from
now
on
i
will
smile
more
often
i
do
it
for
thank
you
for
telling
me
she
said
aloud
your
son
must
have
been
a
good
man
in
his
heart
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
please
let
me
know
they
both
smiled
at
each
other
for
each
knew
that
she
had
found
a
new
friend
the
end
what
a
lovely
story
graham
said
do
you
think
so
telly
he
asked
turning
to
his
friend
but
telly
was
crying
like
a
baby
tears
were
flowing
in
gushes
down
his
screen
and
splashing
off
his
metallic
boots
doré
produced
a
wad
of
tissues
and
dried
his
eyes
you
likely
to
get
a
short
circuit
she
said
by
the
way
i
be
delighted
to
have
you
join
me
for
supper
before
you
continue
on
your
journey
with
that
everyone
went
inside
with
telly
asking
question
after
question
after
supper
everyone
went
out
to
the
porch
to
talk
graham
sat
on
one
of
those
swinging
seats
and
became
lost
in
thought
as
he
swung
gently
back
and
forth
penny
for
your
thoughts
said
doré
sensing
that
the
boy
was
a
little
sad
oh
i
was
just
wondering
if
i
will
ever
find
a
way
to
get
home
i
think
oz
is
a
very
interesting
place
with
lots
of
incredibly
wonderful
people
except
for
that
old
witch
but
i
am
getting
very
homesick
and
i
miss
my
family
terribly
not
only
that
but
they
are
probably
worried
sick
and
have
probably
called
the
police
about
their
missing
child
well
replied
doré
you
just
happen
to
be
in
the
right
place
you
see
that
old
well
where
you
quenched
your
thirst
well
it
a
wishing
well
a
real
true
wishing
well
and
if
you
throw
in
a
coin
and
make
a
sincere
unselfish
wish
your
wish
will
come
true
instantly
of
course
you
only
get
one
guaranteed
wish
but
if
you
make
a
second
wish
you
have
an
eighty
percent
chance
of
that
coming
true
also
graham
immediately
perked
up
as
doré
words
sank
in
then
he
became
crestfallen
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
telly
forlorn
face
not
to
mention
the
disappointment
reflected
in
the
faces
of
the
cowardly
lion
and
the
hungry
tiger
he
had
made
a
wonderful
new
friend
in
telly
and
was
just
getting
to
know
the
others
and
now
they
were
going
to
be
separated
perhaps
forever
doré
quickly
realizing
what
the
situation
was
offered
her
condolences
but
assured
graham
that
if
he
were
to
make
that
second
wish
with
great
sincerity
there
was
a
very
good
chance
he
could
come
back
for
a
visit
with
that
graham
shook
hands
with
everyone
and
gave
them
each
a
big
hug
he
then
threw
a
penny
into
the
well
as
he
made
his
two
wishes
i
wish
to
go
back
home
and
i
wish
to
come
back
to
oz
someday
for
a
visit
then
as
he
waved
goodbye
to
everyone
he
slowly
became
invisible
only
to
reappear
for
a
second
then
slowly
disappear
again
this
happened
two
or
three
times
as
doré
explained
to
telly
that
the
magic
was
working
all
right
but
that
graham
mixed
feelings
on
the
matter
were
delaying
the
final
teleportation
just
then
there
was
a
large
black
shadow
overhead
and
a
sudden
whoosh
as
a
projectile
whizzed
past
graham
head
back
and
forth
it
went
to
reveal
none
other
than
the
wicked
witch
on
her
broomstick
grabbing
for
graham
as
she
passed
him
so
little
man
thought
you
escape
from
me
eh
i
do
think
so
my
fine
feathered
friend
she
wailed
like
a
banshee
as
she
finally
grabbed
him
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
him
as
he
desperately
tried
to
escape
in
the
distance
graham
fancied
he
could
hear
his
mother
voice
calling
him
graham
graham
his
eyes
which
had
been
shut
tightly
as
the
witch
shook
him
opened
to
see
with
great
surprise
his
mother
face
as
she
also
shook
him
wake
up
wake
up
do
you
know
it
twelve
midnight
and
you
have
even
done
your
homework
your
father
will
be
having
serious
words
with
you
in
the
morning
young
man
now
up
to
your
room
immediately
graham
had
not
been
expecting
to
come
home
to
such
a
but
he
was
very
happy
to
finally
be
back
home
after
so
many
harrowing
experiences
ever
since
he
had
first
been
abducted
to
oz
he
had
considered
it
his
mission
to
get
home
again
the
wishing
well
had
made
it
possible
but
as
graham
turned
out
the
light
beside
his
bed
that
night
and
laid
his
head
against
his
pillow
he
began
to
think
over
the
events
that
he
had
experienced
in
oz
of
course
he
had
wanted
to
get
home
to
his
family
it
only
made
sense
that
he
would
he
was
only
twelve
and
he
needed
them
not
only
that
but
they
would
be
worried
sick
he
had
made
a
sensible
wish
or
had
he
as
he
lay
on
his
bed
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
have
used
his
penny
to
wish
away
the
wicked
witch
and
save
oz
a
feeling
of
guilt
began
to
gnaw
at
him
had
he
actually
used
his
penny
to
desert
his
friends
when
they
needed
him
most
he
realized
then
what
a
selfish
act
that
had
been
entirely
he
thought
was
thinking
of
my
family
as
much
as
but
he
knew
that
he
was
making
excuses
and
that
he
should
have
wished
more
wisely
as
he
slowly
drifted
off
into
a
troubled
sleep
he
saw
images
of
the
cowardly
lion
the
hungry
tiger
telly
macdonald
lindsay
doré
and
many
other
oz
folk
pass
before
his
eyes
illustration
the
following
day
graham
mother
was
sorting
the
boy
dirty
clothes
for
the
wash
when
she
noticed
an
ink
stain
on
his
shirt
pocket
she
checked
the
pocket
and
found
a
piece
of
paper
with
some
kind
of
smudged
drawing
and
words
below
the
sketch
that
she
could
not
make
out
without
her
reading
glasses
it
looked
like
something
speare
without
a
thought
she
crumpled
it
up
into
a
ball
and
threw
it
in
the
trash
to
be
continued
