an
elderly
man
with
a
wooden
leg
who
joined
the
indignant
officer
in
the
pursuit
fortunately
for
captain
bligh
there
were
but
few
people
about
and
the
only
person
who
saw
him
trip
pilbeam
was
an
elderly
man
with
a
wooden
leg
who
joined
the
indignant
officer
in
the
pursuit
the
captain
had
youth
on
his
side
and
diving
into
the
narrow
that
constitute
the
older
portion
of
he
moderated
his
pace
and
listened
acutely
the
sounds
of
pursuit
died
away
in
the
distance
and
he
had
already
dropped
into
a
walk
when
the
hurried
tap
of
the
wooden
leg
sounded
from
one
corner
and
a
chorus
of
hurried
voices
from
the
other
it
was
clear
that
the
number
of
hunters
had
increased
he
paused
a
second
irresolute
the
next
he
pushed
open
a
door
that
stood
ajar
in
an
old
flint
wall
and
peeped
in
he
saw
a
small
paved
yard
in
which
trim
myrtles
and
flowering
plants
stood
about
in
freshly
ochred
pots
and
opening
the
door
a
little
wider
he
slipped
in
and
closed
it
behind
him
well
said
a
voice
sharply
what
do
you
want
captain
bligh
turned
and
saw
a
girl
standing
in
a
hostile
attitude
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
he
said
holding
up
his
finger
the
girl
cheeks
flushed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
what
are
you
doing
in
our
yard
she
demanded
the
captain
face
relaxed
as
the
sound
of
voices
died
away
he
gave
his
moustache
a
twist
and
eyed
her
with
frank
admiration
escaping
he
said
briefly
they
nearly
had
me
though
you
had
no
business
to
escape
into
our
yard
said
the
girl
what
have
you
been
escaping
from
fat
policeman
said
the
skipper
jauntily
twisting
his
moustache
miss
pilbeam
only
daughter
of
sergeant
pilbeam
caught
her
breath
sharply
what
have
you
been
doing
she
inquired
as
soon
as
she
could
control
her
voice
nothing
said
the
skipper
airily
nothing
i
was
kicking
a
stone
along
the
path
and
he
told
me
to
stop
it
well
said
miss
pilbeam
impatiently
we
had
words
said
the
skipper
i
do
like
policemen
fat
policemen
and
while
we
were
talking
he
happened
to
lose
his
balance
and
go
over
into
some
mud
that
was
swept
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
lost
his
balance
gasped
the
horrified
miss
pilbeam
the
skipper
was
flattered
at
her
concern
you
would
have
laughed
if
you
had
seen
him
he
said
smiling
do
look
so
frightened
he
got
me
yet
no
said
the
girl
slowly
not
yet
she
gazed
at
him
with
such
a
world
of
longing
in
her
eyes
that
the
skipper
despite
a
somewhat
large
share
of
was
almost
startled
and
he
sha
have
me
he
said
returning
her
gaze
with
interest
miss
pilbeam
stood
in
silent
thought
she
was
a
strong
girl
but
she
realized
fully
that
she
was
no
match
for
the
villain
who
stood
before
her
twisting
his
moustache
and
adjusting
his
and
her
father
would
not
be
off
duty
until
nine
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
wait
here
until
it
is
dark
she
said
at
last
i
would
sooner
wait
here
than
anywhere
said
the
skipper
with
respectful
ardor
perhaps
you
would
like
to
come
in
and
sit
down
said
the
girl
captain
bligh
thanked
her
and
removing
his
cap
followed
her
into
a
small
parlor
in
the
front
of
the
house
father
is
out
she
said
as
she
motioned
him
to
an
but
sure
he
be
pleased
to
see
you
when
he
comes
in
and
i
shall
be
pleased
to
see
him
said
the
innocent
skipper
miss
pilbeam
kept
her
doubts
to
herself
and
sat
in
a
brown
study
wondering
how
the
capture
was
to
be
effected
she
had
a
strong
presentiment
that
the
appearance
of
her
father
at
the
front
door
would
be
the
signal
for
her
visitor
departure
at
the
back
for
a
time
there
was
an
awkward
silence
lucky
thing
for
me
i
upset
that
policeman
said
the
skipper
at
last
why
inquired
the
girl
else
i
should
have
come
into
your
yard
was
the
reply
it
the
first
time
we
have
ever
put
into
woodhatch
and
i
might
have
sailed
away
and
never
seen
you
where
should
we
have
been
but
for
that
fat
policeman
miss
pilbeam
as
soon
as
she
could
get
her
breath
said
ah
where
indeed
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
began
to
feel
the
need
of
a
chaperon
funny
to
think
of
him
hunting
for
me
high
and
low
while
i
am
sitting
here
said
the
skipper
miss
pilbeam
agreed
with
him
and
began
to
laugh
to
laugh
so
heartily
that
he
was
fain
at
last
to
draw
his
chair
close
to
hers
and
pat
her
somewhat
anxiously
on
the
back
the
treatment
sobered
her
at
once
and
she
drew
apart
and
eyed
him
coldly
i
was
afraid
you
would
lose
your
breath
explained
the
skipper
awkwardly
you
are
not
angry
are
you
he
was
so
genuinely
relieved
when
she
said
no
that
miss
pilbeam
despite
her
father
wrongs
began
to
soften
a
little
the
upsetter
of
policemen
was
certainly
and
his
manner
towards
her
so
nicely
balanced
between
boldness
and
timidity
that
a
slight
feeling
of
sadness
at
his
lack
of
moral
character
began
to
assail
her
suppose
you
are
caught
after
all
she
said
presently
you
will
go
to
prison
the
skipper
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
suppose
i
shall
be
he
replied
are
you
sorry
persisted
miss
pilbeam
in
a
vibrant
voice
certainly
not
said
the
skipper
why
i
should
have
seen
you
if
i
had
done
it
miss
pilbeam
looked
at
the
clock
and
pondered
it
wanted
but
five
minutes
to
nine
five
minutes
in
which
to
make
up
a
mind
that
was
in
a
state
of
strong
unrest
i
suppose
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
said
the
skipper
watching
her
miss
pilbeam
rose
no
do
go
she
said
hastily
do
be
quiet
i
want
to
think
captain
bligh
waited
in
respectful
silence
heedless
of
the
fateful
seconds
ticking
from
the
mantelpiece
at
the
sound
of
a
slow
measured
footfall
on
the
cobblestone
path
outside
miss
pilbeam
caught
his
arm
and
drew
him
towards
the
door
go
she
breathed
no
stop
she
stood
trying
in
vain
to
make
up
her
mind
upstairs
she
said
quick
and
leading
the
way
entered
her
father
bedroom
and
after
a
moment
thought
opened
the
door
of
a
cupboard
in
the
corner
get
in
there
she
whispered
but
objected
the
astonished
bligh
the
front
door
was
heard
to
open
police
said
miss
pilbeam
in
a
thrilling
whisper
the
skipper
stepped
into
the
cupboard
without
further
parley
and
the
girl
turning
the
key
slipped
it
into
her
pocket
and
sped
downstairs
sergeant
pilbeam
was
in
the
with
his
belt
unfastened
when
she
entered
the
parlor
and
with
a
hungry
reference
to
supper
sat
watching
her
as
she
lit
the
lamp
and
drew
down
the
blind
with
a
lifelong
knowledge
of
the
requirements
of
the
force
she
drew
a
jug
of
beer
and
placed
it
by
his
side
while
she
set
the
table
ah
i
wanted
that
said
the
sergeant
i
been
running
miss
pilbeam
raised
her
eyebrows
after
some
chap
that
capsized
me
when
i
was
prepared
for
it
said
her
father
putting
down
his
glass
it
was
a
neat
bit
work
and
i
shall
tell
him
so
when
i
catch
him
look
here
he
stood
up
and
exhibited
the
damage
i
rubbed
off
what
i
could
he
said
resuming
his
seat
and
i
the
rest
brush
off
when
it
dry
morning
i
shall
go
down
to
the
harbor
and
try
and
spot
my
lord
he
drew
his
chair
to
the
table
and
helped
himself
and
filling
his
mouth
with
cold
meat
and
pickles
enlarged
on
his
plans
for
the
capture
of
his
assailant
plans
to
which
the
undecided
miss
pilbeam
turned
a
somewhat
abstracted
ear
by
the
time
her
father
had
finished
his
supper
she
was
trying
but
in
vain
to
devise
means
for
the
prisoner
escape
the
sergeant
had
opened
the
door
of
the
room
for
the
sake
of
fresh
air
and
it
was
impossible
for
anybody
to
come
downstairs
without
being
seen
the
story
of
a
sickly
geranium
in
the
left
him
unmoved
i
would
get
up
for
all
the
geraniums
in
the
world
he
declared
i
just
going
to
have
one
more
pipe
and
then
i
off
to
bed
running
do
agree
with
me
he
went
despite
his
daughter
utmost
efforts
to
prevent
him
and
she
sat
in
silent
consternation
listening
to
his
heavy
tread
overhead
she
heard
the
bed
creak
in
noisy
protest
as
he
climbed
in
and
ten
minutes
later
the
lusty
snoring
of
a
healthy
man
of
full
habit
resounded
through
the
house
she
went
to
bed
herself
at
last
and
after
lying
awake
for
nearly
a
couple
of
hours
closed
her
eyes
in
order
to
think
better
she
awoke
with
the
sun
pouring
in
at
the
window
and
the
sounds
of
vigorous
brushing
in
the
yard
beneath
i
nearly
got
it
off
said
the
sergeant
looking
up
destroying
evidence
in
a
sense
i
suppose
but
i
ca
go
about
with
my
uniform
plastered
with
mud
i
had
enough
chaff
about
it
as
it
is
miss
pilbeam
stole
to
the
door
of
the
next
room
and
peeped
stealthily
in
not
a
sound
came
from
the
cupboard
and
a
horrible
idea
that
the
prisoner
might
have
been
suffocated
set
her
trembling
with
apprehension
she
whispered
an
eager
but
stifled
came
from
the
and
miss
pilbeam
her
fears
allayed
stepped
softly
into
the
room
he
downstairs
brushing
the
mud
off
she
said
in
a
low
voice
who
is
said
the
skipper
the
fat
policeman
said
the
girl
in
a
hard
voice
as
she
remembered
her
father
wrongs
what
he
doing
it
here
for
demanded
the
astonished
skipper
because
he
lives
here
lodger
queried
the
skipper
more
astonished
than
before
father
said
miss
pilbeam
a
horrified
groan
from
the
cupboard
fell
like
music
on
her
ears
then
the
smile
forsook
her
lips
and
she
stood
quivering
with
indignation
as
the
groan
gave
way
to
suppressed
but
unmistakable
laughter
she
said
sharply
and
with
head
erect
sailed
out
of
the
room
and
went
downstairs
to
give
pilbeam
his
breakfast
to
the
skipper
in
the
confined
space
and
darkness
of
the
cupboard
the
breakfast
seemed
unending
the
sergeant
evidently
believed
in
sitting
over
his
meals
and
his
deep
rumbling
voice
punctuated
by
laughter
was
plainly
audible
to
pass
the
time
the
skipper
fell
to
counting
and
tired
of
that
recited
some
verses
that
he
had
acquired
at
school
after
that
and
with
far
more
heartiness
he
declaimed
a
few
things
that
he
had
learned
since
and
still
the
clatter
and
rumble
sounded
from
below
it
was
a
relief
to
him
when
he
heard
the
sergeant
push
his
chair
back
and
move
heavily
about
the
room
a
minute
later
he
heard
him
ascending
the
stairs
and
then
he
held
his
breath
with
horror
as
the
entered
the
room
and
a
heavy
hand
was
laid
on
the
cupboard
door
elsie
bawled
the
sergeant
where
the
key
of
my
cupboard
i
want
my
other
boots
they
down
here
cried
the
voice
of
miss
pilbeam
and
the
skipper
hardly
able
to
believe
in
his
good
fortune
heard
the
sergeant
go
downstairs
again
at
the
expiration
of
another
week
by
his
own
reckoning
he
heard
the
light
hurried
footsteps
of
miss
pilbeam
come
up
the
stairs
and
pause
at
the
door
he
said
recklessly
i
coming
said
the
girl
do
be
impatient
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
skipper
dazed
and
blinking
with
the
sudden
light
stumbled
into
the
room
father
gone
said
miss
pilbeam
the
skipper
made
no
answer
he
was
administering
first
aid
to
a
right
leg
which
had
temporarily
forgotten
how
to
perform
its
duties
varied
with
slaps
and
pinches
at
a
left
which
had
gone
to
sleep
at
intervals
he
turned
a
and
reproachful
eye
on
miss
pilbeam
illustration
he
was
administering
first
aid
to
a
right
leg
you
want
a
wash
and
some
breakfast
she
said
softly
especially
a
wash
there
water
and
a
towel
and
while
you
making
yourself
tidy
i
be
getting
breakfast
the
skipper
hobbled
to
the
and
dipping
his
head
in
a
basin
of
cool
water
began
to
feel
himself
again
by
the
time
he
had
done
his
hair
in
the
sergeant
glass
and
twisted
his
moustache
into
shape
he
felt
better
still
and
he
went
downstairs
almost
blithely
i
very
sorry
it
was
your
father
he
said
as
he
took
a
seat
at
the
table
very
that
why
you
laughed
i
suppose
said
the
girl
tossing
her
head
well
i
had
the
worst
of
it
said
the
other
i
sooner
be
upset
a
hundred
times
than
spend
a
night
in
that
cupboard
however
all
well
that
ends
well
ah
said
miss
pilbeam
dolefully
but
is
it
the
end
captain
bligh
put
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
eyed
her
uneasily
what
do
you
mean
he
said
never
mind
do
spoil
your
breakfast
said
the
girl
i
tell
you
afterwards
it
horrid
to
think
after
all
my
trouble
of
your
doing
two
months
as
well
as
a
night
in
the
cupboard
beastly
said
the
unfortunate
eying
her
in
great
concern
but
the
matter
one
ca
think
of
everything
said
miss
pilbeam
but
of
course
we
ought
to
have
thought
of
the
mate
getting
uneasy
when
you
did
turn
up
last
night
and
going
to
the
with
a
description
of
you
the
skipper
started
and
smote
the
table
with
his
fist
father
gone
down
to
watch
the
ship
now
said
miss
pilbeam
of
course
it
the
exact
description
of
the
man
that
assaulted
him
providential
he
called
it
that
the
worst
of
having
a
fool
for
a
mate
said
the
skipper
bitterly
what
business
was
it
of
his
i
should
like
to
know
it
got
to
do
with
him
whether
i
turn
up
or
not
what
does
he
want
to
interfere
for
it
no
good
blaming
him
said
miss
pilbeam
thinking
deeply
with
her
chin
on
her
finger
the
thing
is
what
is
to
be
done
once
father
gets
his
hand
on
you
she
shuddered
so
did
the
skipper
i
might
get
off
with
a
fine
i
did
hurt
him
he
remarked
miss
pilbeam
shook
her
head
they
very
strict
in
woodhatch
she
said
i
was
a
fool
to
touch
him
at
all
said
the
repentant
skipper
high
spirits
that
what
it
was
high
spirits
and
being
spoken
to
as
if
i
was
a
child
the
thing
is
how
are
you
to
escape
said
the
girl
it
no
good
going
out
of
doors
with
the
police
and
half
the
people
in
woodhatch
all
on
the
for
you
if
i
could
only
get
aboard
i
should
be
all
right
muttered
the
skipper
i
could
keep
down
the
while
the
mate
took
the
ship
out
miss
pilbeam
sat
in
deep
thought
it
the
getting
aboard
that
the
trouble
she
said
slowly
you
have
to
disguise
yourself
it
would
have
to
be
a
good
disguise
too
to
pass
my
father
i
can
tell
you
captain
bligh
gave
a
gloomy
assent
the
only
thing
for
you
to
do
so
far
as
i
can
see
said
the
girl
slowly
is
to
make
yourself
up
like
a
coalie
there
are
one
or
two
colliers
in
the
harbor
and
if
you
took
off
your
coat
i
could
send
it
on
afterwards
rubbed
yourself
all
over
with
and
shaved
off
your
moustache
i
believe
you
would
escape
shave
ejaculated
the
skipper
in
choking
accents
rub
it
your
only
chance
said
miss
pilbeam
captain
bligh
leaned
back
frowning
and
from
sheer
force
of
habit
passed
the
ends
of
his
moustache
slowly
through
his
fingers
i
think
the
dust
would
be
enough
he
said
at
last
the
girl
shook
her
head
father
particularly
noticed
your
moustache
she
said
everybody
does
said
the
skipper
with
mournful
pride
i
wo
part
with
it
not
for
my
sake
inquired
miss
pilbeam
eying
him
mournfully
not
after
all
i
done
for
you
no
said
the
other
stoutly
miss
pilbeam
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
with
a
suspicious
little
sniff
hurried
from
the
room
captain
bligh
much
affected
waited
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
went
in
pursuit
of
her
fifteen
minutes
later
shorn
of
his
moustache
he
stood
in
the
sulkily
smearing
himself
with
coal
that
better
said
the
girl
you
look
horrible
she
took
up
a
handful
of
and
ordering
him
to
stoop
shampooed
him
with
hearty

she
took
up
a
handful
of
and
ordering
him
to
stoop
shampooed
him
with
hearty
no
good
half
doing
it
she
declared
now
go
and
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
in
the
kitchen
the
skipper
went
and
came
back
in
a
state
of
misery
even
miss
pilbeam
statement
that
his
own
mother
would
not
know
him
failed
to
lift
the
cloud
from
his
brow
he
stood
disconsolate
as
the
girl
opened
the
front
door
she
said
gently
write
and
tell
me
when
you
are
safe
captain
bligh
promised
and
walked
slowly
up
the
road
so
far
from
people
attempting
to
arrest
him
they
vied
with
each
other
in
giving
him
he
reached
the
harbor
unmolested
and
lurking
at
a
convenient
corner
made
a
careful
survey
a
couple
of
craft
were
working
out
their
coal
a
small
steamer
was
just
casting
loose
and
a
boat
gliding
slowly
over
the
still
water
to
its
berth
his
own
schooner
which
lay
near
the
colliers
had
apparently
knocked
off
work
pending
his
arrival
for
sergeant
pilbeam
he
looked
in
vain
he
waited
a
minute
or
two
and
then
with
a
furtive
glance
right
and
left
strolled
in
a
careless
fashion
until
he
was
abreast
of
one
of
the
colliers
nobody
took
any
notice
of
him
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
gazed
meditatively
into
the
water
and
edged
along
towards
his
own
craft
his
foot
trembled
as
he
placed
it
on
the
plank
that
formed
the
gangway
but
resisting
the
temptation
to
look
behind
he
gained
the
deck
and
walked
forward
halloa
what
do
you
want
inquired
a
coming
out
of
the
galley
all
right
bill
said
the
skipper
in
a
low
voice
do

any
notice
of
me
eh
said
the
seaman
starting
good
lor
what
ha
you
shut
up
said
the
skipper
fiercely
and
walking
to
the
forecastle
placed
his
hand
on
the
scuttle
and
descended
with
studied
slowness
as
he
reached
the
floor
the
perturbed
face
of
bill
blocked
the
opening
had
an
accident
he
inquired
respectfully
no
snapped
the
skipper
come

attracting
attention
do
you
want
the
whole
town
round

come
down
i
all
right
where
i
am
said
bill
backing
hastily
as
the
skipper
putting
a
foot
on
the
ladder
thrust
a
black
and
furious
face
close
to
his
clear
out
then
hissed
the
skipper
go
and
send
the
mate
to
me
do
hurry
and
if
anybody
noticed
me
come
aboard
and
should
ask
you
who
i
am
say
i
a
pal
of
yours
the
seaman
marvelling
greatly
withdrew
and
the
skipper
throwing
himself
on
a
locker
wiped
a
bit
of
grit
out
of
his
eye
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
mate
he
was
so
long
in
coming
that
he
waxed
impatient
and
ascending
a
step
of
the
ladder
again
peeped
on
to
the
deck
the
first
object
that
met
his
gaze
was
the
figure
of
the
mate
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
ship
with
a
wary
eye
on
the
scuttle
come
here
said
the
skipper
anything
wrong
inquired
the
mate
retreating
a
couple
of
paces
in
disorder
come
here
repeated
the
skipper
the
mate
advanced
slowly
and
in
response
to
an
imperative
command
from
the
skipper
slowly
descended
and
stood
regarding
him
nervously
yes
you
may
look
said
the
skipper
with
sudden
ferocity
this
is
all
your
doing
where
are
you
going
he
caught
the
mate
by
the
coat
as
he
was
making
for
the
ladder
and
hauled
him
back
again
you
go
when
i
finished
with
you
he
said
grimly
now
what
do
you
mean
by
it
eh
what
do
you
mean
by
it
that
all
right
said
the
mate
in
a
soothing
voice
do
get
excited
look
at
me
said
the
skipper
all
through
your
interfering
how
dare
you
go
making
inquiries
about
me
me
said
the
mate
backing
as
far
as
possible
inquiries
what
it
got
to
do
with
you
if
i
stay
out
all
night
pursued
the
skipper
nothing
said
the
other
feebly
what
did
you
go
to
the
police
about
me
for
then
demanded
the
skipper
me
said
the
mate
in
the
shrill
accents
of
astonishment
me
i
did
go
to
no
police
about
you
why
should
i
do
you
mean
to
say
you
did
report
my
absence
last
night
to
the
police
said
the
skipper
sternly
not
said
the
mate
plucking
up
courage
why
should
i
if
you
like
to
take
a
night
off
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
i
know
my
duty
better
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
and
the
police
have
been
watching
the
ship
and
inquiring
for
me
asked
the
skipper
the
mate
shook
his
bewildered
head
why
should
they
he
inquired
the
skipper
made
no
reply
he
sat
staring
straight
before
him
trying
in
vain
to
realize
the
hardness
of
the
heart
that
had
been
responsible
for
such
a
scurvy
trick
besides
it
ai
the
fust
time
you
been
out
all
night
remarked
the
mate
aggressively
the
skipper
favored
him
with
a
glance
the
dignity
of
which
was
somewhat
impaired
by
his
complexion
and
in
a
slow
and
stately
fashion
ascended
to
the
deck
then
he
caught
his
breath
sharply
and
paled
beneath
the
coaldust
as
he
saw
sergeant
pilbeam
standing
on
the
quay
opposite
the
ship
by
his
side
stood
miss
pilbeam
and
both
with
a
look
in
their
eyes
were
smiling
vaguely
but
contentedly
at
the
horizon
the
sergeant
appeared
to
be
the
first
to
see
the
skipper
ahoy
darkie
he
cried
captain
bligh
who
was
creeping
slowly
aft
halted
and
clenching
his
fists
regarded
him
ferociously
give
this
to
the
skipper
will
you
my
lad
said
the
sergeant
holding
up
the
jacket
bligh
had
left
behind
young
man
with
a
very
fine
moustache
he
is
illustration
give
this
to
the
skipper
will
you
my
lad
said
the
sergeant
was
said
his
daughter
in
a
mournful
voice
and
a
rather
dark
complexion
continued
the
sergeant
grinning
madly
i
was
going
to
take
him
for
stealing
my
coal
but
i
thought
better
of
it
thought
of
a
better
way
at
least
my
daughter
did
so
long
darkie
he
kissed
the
top
of
a
fat
middle
finger
and
turning
away
walked
off
with
miss
pilbeam
the
skipper
stood
watching
them
with
his
head
swimming
until
arrived
at
the
corner
they
stopped
and
the
sergeant
came
slowly
back
i
was
nearly
forgetting
he
said
slowly
tell
your
skipper
that
if
so
be
as
he
wants
to
apologize
for
stealing
my
coal
i
shall
be
at
home
at
tea
at
five
he
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
miss
pilbeam
and
winked
with
slow
deliberation
she
be
there
too
he
added
savvy
