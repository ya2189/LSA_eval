strike
me
as
being
the
most
ungodly
menagerie
ever
gotten
together
under
one
roof

landed
on

no

in

lady
he
asked
very
softly
you
any
good
news
for
me
on
this
wonderful
morning
miss
hugonin
pouted
need
be
such
a
grandfather
she
suggested
helpfully
regarded
them
with
alert
eyes
the
eagle
shadow
i
this
is
the
story
of
margaret
hugonin
and
of
the
eagle
and
with
your
permission
we
will
for
the
present
defer
all
consideration
of
the
bird
and
devote
our
unqualified
attention
to
margaret
i
have
always
esteemed
margaret
the
obvious
sensible
most
appropriate
name
that
can
be
bestowed
upon
a
for
it
is
a
name
that
fits
a
woman
any
woman
as
neatly
as
her
proper
size
in
gloves
yes
the
first
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that
a
once
baptised
margaret
is
thereby
insured
of
a
suitable
name
be
she
grave
or
gay
in
wanton
or
pious
or
sullen
comely
or
otherwise
there
will
be
no
possible
chance
of
incongruity
whether
she
develop
a
taste
for
or
the
higher
mathematics
whether
she
take
to
golf
or
clinging
organdies
the
event
is
provided
for
one
has
only
to
consider
for
a
moment
and
if
among
a
choice
of
madge
marjorie
meta
maggie
margherita
peggy
and
gretchen
and
countless
others
if
among
all
these
he
can
not
find
a
name
that
suits
her
to
a
t
why
then
the
case
is
indeed
desperate
and
he
may
permissibly
fall
back
upon
madam
or
if
the
cat
jump
propitiously
and
at
his
own
peril
on
darling
or
sweetheart
the
second
proof
that
this
name
must
be
the
best
of
all
possible
names
is
that
margaret
hugonin
bore
it
and
so
the
murder
is
out
you
may
suspect
what
you
choose
i
warn
you
in
advance
that
i
have
no
part
whatever
in
her
story
and
if
my
admiration
for
her
given
name
appear
somewhat
excessive
i
can
only
protest
that
in
this
dissentient
world
every
one
has
a
right
to
his
own
taste
i
knew
margaret
i
admired
her
and
if
in
some
unguarded
moment
i
may
have
carried
my
admiration
to
the
point
of
indiscretion
her
husband
most
assuredly
knows
all
about
it
by
this
and
he
and
i
are
still
the
best
of
friends
so
you
perceive
that
if
i
ever
did
so
far
forget
myself
it
could
scarcely
have
amounted
to
a
hanging
matter
i
am
doubly
sure
that
margaret
hugonin
was
beautiful
for
the
reason
that
i
have
never
found
a
woman
under
who
shared
my
opinion
if
you
clap
a
testament
into
my
hand
i
can
not
affirm
that
women
are
eager
to
recognise
beauty
in
one
another
at
the
utmost
they
concede
that
this
or
that
particular
feature
is
well
enough
but
when
a
woman
is
and
and
has
a
cheery
heart
she
really
can
not
help
being
beautiful
and
when
nature
accords
her
a
sufficiency
of
dimples
and
an
infectious
laugh
i
protest
she
is
irresistible
and
all
these
margaret
hugonin
had
and
surely
that
is
enough
i
shall
not
endeavour
then
to
picture
her
features
to
you
in
any
nicely
picked
words
her
chief
charm
was
that
she
was
margaret
and
besides
that
mere
carnal
vanities
are
trivial
things
a
gray
eye
or
so
is
not
in
the
least
to
the
purpose
yet
since
it
is
the
immemorial
custom
of
to
inventory
such
possessions
of
their
heroines
here
you
have
a
catalogue
of
her
personal
attractions
launce
method
will
serve
our
turn
imprimis
there
was
not
very
much
of
her
five
feet
three
at
the
most
and
hers
was
the
modern
type
that
implies
a
grandfather
or
two
and
is
in
every
respect
the
antithesis
of
that
hulking
venus
of
the
louvre
whom
people
pretend
to
admire
item
she
had
blue
eyes
and
when
she
talked
with
you
her
head
drooped
forward
a
little
the
frank
intent
gaze
of
these
eyes
was
very
flattering
and
in
its
ultimate
effect
perilous
since
it
led
you
fatuously
to
believe
that
she
had
forgotten
there
were
any
other
trousered
beings
extant
later
on
you
found
this
a
decided
error
item
she
had
a
quite
incredible
amount
of
yellow
hair
that
was
not
in
the
least
like
gold
or
copper
or
bronze
i
scorn
the
hackneyed
similes
of
metallurgical
poets
but
a
straightforward
yellow
darkening
at
the
roots
and
she
wore
it
low
down
on
her
neck
in
great
coils
that
were
held
in
place
by
a
multitude
of
little
golden
and
divers
corpulent
ones
item
her
nose
was
a
tiny
miracle
of
perfection
and
this
was
noteworthy
for
you
will
observe
that
nature
who
is
an
adept
at
eyes
and
hair
and
mouths
very
rarely
achieves
a
creditable
nose
item
she
had
a
mouth
and
if
you
are
a
gradgrindian
with
a
taste
for
hairsplitting
i
can
not
swear
that
it
was
a
particularly
small
mouth
the
lips
were
rather
full
than
otherwise
one
saw
in
them
potentialities
of
heroic
passion
and
tenderness
and
generosity
and
if
you
will
temper
no
her
mouth
was
not
in
the
least
like
the
pink
of
romance
and
sugared
portraiture
it
was
manifestly
designed
less
for
simpering
out
of
a
gilt
frame
or
the
dribbling
of
stock
phrases
over
three
hundred
pages
than
for
gibes
and
laughter
and
cheery
gossip
and
honest
unromantic
eating
as
well
as
another
purpose
which
as
a
highly
dangerous
topic
i
decline
even
to
mention
there
you
have
the
best
description
of
margaret
hugonin
that
i
am
capable
of
giving
you
no
one
realises
its
glaring
inadequacy
more
acutely
than
i
furthermore
i
stipulate
that
if
in
the
progress
of
our
comedy
she
appear
to
act
with
an
utter
lack
of
reason
or
even
as
every
woman
worth
the
winning
must
do
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime
that
i
be
permitted
to
record
the
fact
to
set
it
down
in
all
its
ugliness
nay
even
to
exaggerate
it
a
little
all
to
the
end
that
i
may
eventually
exasperate
you
and
goad
you
into
crying
out
come
come
you
are
not
treating
the
girl
with
common
justice
for
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
i
should
desire
you
to
rival
even
me
in
a
liking
for
margaret
hugonin
and
speaking
for
myself
i
can
assure
you
that
i
have
come
long
ago
to
regard
her
faults
with
the
same
leniency
that
i
accord
my
own
ii
we
begin
on
a
fine
may
morning
in
colonel
hugonin
rooms
at
selwoode
which
is
as
you
may
or
may
not
know
the
hugonins
and
there
we
discover
the
colonel
dawdling
over
his
breakfast
in
an
intermediate
stage
of
that
careful
toilet
which
enables
him
later
in
the
day
to
pass
casual
inspection
as
turning
at
present
the
old
gentleman
is
discussing
the
members
of
his
daughter
we
will
omit
by
your
leave
a
number
of
picturesque
descriptive
passages
for
the
colonel
is
on
occasion
a
man
of
unfettered
speech
and
come
hastily
to
the
conclusion
to
the
of
the
whole
matter
altogether
says
colonel
hugonin
they
strike
me
as
being
the
most
ungodly
menagerie
ever
gotten
together
under
one
roof
since
noah
landed
on
ararat
now
i
am
sorry
that
veracity
compels
me
to
present
the
colonel
in
this
particular
state
of
mind
for
ordinarily
he
was
as
a
gentleman
as
you
will
be
apt
to
meet
on
the
longest
summer
day
illustration
says
colonel
hugonin
strike
me
as
being
the
most
ungodly
menagerie
ever
gotten
together
under
one
roof
since
noah
landed
on
ararat
you
must
make
allowances
for
the
fact
that
on
this
especial
morning
he
was
still
suffering
from
a
recent
twinge
of
the
gout
and
that
his
toast
was
somewhat
dryer
than
he
liked
it
and
most
potent
of
all
that
the
foreign
mail
just
in
had
caused
him
to
rebel
anew
against
the
proprieties
and
his
daughter
inclinations
which
chained
him
to
selwoode
in
the
height
of
the
full
london
season
to
preside
over
a
every
member
of
which
he
cordially
disliked
therefore
the
colonel
having
glanced
through
the
names
of
those
at
lady
pevensey
last
cotillion
groaned
and
glared
at
his
daughter
who
sat
opposite
him
and
reviled
his
daughter
friends
with
point
and
fluency
and
characterised
them
as
above
for
the
reason
that
he
was
hungered
at
heart
for
the
shady
side
of
pall
mall
and
that
their
presence
at
selwoode
prevented
his
attaining
this
elysium
for
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
colonel
loathed
all
things
american
saving
his
daughter
whom
he
worshipped
and
i
think
no
one
who
could
have
seen
her
preparing
his
second
cup
of
tea
would
have
disputed
that
in
making
this
exception
he
acted
with
a
show
of
reason
for
margaret
hugonin
but
as
you
know
she
is
our
heroine
and
as
i
fear
you
have
already
learned
words
are
very
paltry
makeshifts
when
it
comes
to
describing
her
let
us
simply
say
then
that
margaret
his
daughter
began
to
make
him
a
cup
of
tea
and
add
that
she
laughed
not
unkindly
no
for
at
bottom
she
adored
her
father
a
comely
englishman
of
some
who
had
run
through
his
wife
fortune
and
his
own
in
the
most
gallant
fashion
and
she
accorded
his
opinions
a
conscientious
but
at
times
a
sorely
taxed
tolerance
that
very
month
she
had
reached
the
age
of
omniscience
when
the
fallacies
and
general
obtuseness
of
older
people
become
dishearteningly
apparent
it
nonsense
pursued
the
old
gentleman
utter
bedlamite
nonsense
filling
selwoode
up
with
writing
people
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
gad
i
do
remember
as
a
young
man
meeting
thackeray
at
a
at
orleans
house
gentlemanly
fellow
with
a
broken
nose
and
browning
went
about
a
bit
too
now
i
think
of
it
people
had
one
at
a
time
to
lend
flavour
to
a
dinner
like
an
olive
we
dine
on
olives
though
you
have
for
breakfast
luncheon
dinner
and
everything
i
sick
of
olives
i
tell
you
margaret
margaret
pouted
they
ai
even
good
olives
i
looked
into
one
of
that
fellow
charteris
books
the
other
day
that
chap
you
had
here
last
week
it
was
bally
rot
proverbs
standing
on
their
heads
and
grinning
like
dwarfs
in
a
condemned
who
wants
to
be
told
that
impropriety
is
the
spice
of
life
and
that
a
roving
eye
gathers
remorse
may
call
that
sort
of
thing
cleverness
if
you
like
i
call
it
damn
foolishness
and
the
emphasis
with
which
he
said
this
left
no
doubt
that
the
colonel
spoke
his
honest
opinion
attractive
said
his
daughter
patiently
charteris
is
very
very
clever
kennaston
says
literature
suffered
a
considerable
loss
when
he
began
to
write
for
the
magazines
and
now
that
margaret
has
spoken
permit
me
to
call
your
attention
to
her
voice
mellow
and
suave
and
of
astonishing
volume
was
voice
it
came
not
from
the
back
of
her
throat
as
most
of
our
voices
do
but
from
her
chest
and
i
protest
it
had
the
timbre
of
a
violin
men
hearing
her
voice
for
the
first
time
were
wont
to
stare
at
her
a
little
and
afterward
to
close
their
hands
slowly
for
always
its
modulations
had
the
tonic
sadness
of
distant
music
and
it
thrilled
you
to
much
the
same
magnanimity
and
yearning
cloudily
conceived
and
yet
you
could
not
but
smile
in
spite
of
yourself
at
the
quaint
emphasis
fluttering
through
her
speech
and
pouncing
for
the
most
part
on
the
unlikeliest
word
in
the
whole
sentence
but
i
fancy
the
colonel
must
have
been
do
you
make
phrases
for
me
he
snorted
you
keep
for
your
menagerie
think
by
gad
the
world
never
thinks
i
believe
the
world
deliberately
reads
the
six
bestselling
books
in
order
to
incapacitate
itself
for
thinking
then
his
wrath
gathering
emphasis
as
he
went
on
the
longer
i
live
the
plainer
i
see
shakespeare
was
right
what
fools
these
mortals
be
and
all
that
there
that
haggage
woman
through
the
country
like
a
hiatused
politician
it
may
be
philanthropic
but
it
ai
ladylike
no
begad
what
has
she
got
to
do
with
juvenile
courts
and
in
the
south
like
to
know
why
ai
she
at
home
attending
to
that
crippled
boy
of
hers
poor
little
beggar
instead
of
flaunting
through
america
meddling
with
other
folk
children
miss
hugonin
put
another
lump
of
sugar
into
his
cup
and
deigned
no
reply
by
gad
cried
the
colonel
fervently
if
you
so
anxious
to
spend
that
money
of
yours
in
charity
why
do
you
found
a
day
nursery
for
the
children
of
philanthropists
a
place
where
advanced
men
and
women
can
leave
their
offspring
in
capable
hands
when
they
busied
with
mothers
meetings
and
educational
conferences
it
would
do
a
thousand
times
more
good
i
can
tell
you
than
that
fresh
kindergarten
scheme
of
yours
for
teaching
the
children
of
the
labouring
classes
to
make
a
new
sort
of
you
do
understand
these
things
attractive
margaret
gently
pointed
out
you
are
in
harmony
with
the
trend
of
modern
thought
no
thank
god
said
the
colonel
heartily
ensued
a
silence
during
which
he
chipped
at
his
in
an
fashion
that
fellow
kennaston
said
anything
to
you
yet
he
presently
queried
i
i
do
understand
she
protested
oh
perfectly
unconvincingly
the
too
engrossed
her
at
this
point
to
an
utterly
improbable
extent
thus
it
shortly
befell
that
the
colonel
still
regarding
her
under
intent
brows
cleared
his
throat
and
made
bold
to
question
her
generosity
in
the
matter
of
sugar
five
lumps
being
as
he
suggested
a
rather
unusual
allowance
for
one
cup
then
kennaston
and
i
are
very
good
friends
said
she
with
dignity
and
having
spoiled
the
first
cup
in
the
making
she
began
on
another
glad
to
hear
it
growled
the
old
gentleman
i
hope
you
value
his
friendship
sufficiently
not
to
marry
him
the
man
a
fraud
a
flimsy
sickening
fraud
like
his
poetry
begad
and
that
made
up
of
botany
and
wide
margins
and
indecency
in
about
equal
proportions
it
fit
for
a
woman
to
read
in
fact
a
woman
ought
not
to
read
anything
a
comprehension
of
the
decalogue
and
the
is
enough
learning
for
the
best
of
your
mother
never
never
colonel
hugonin
paused
and
stared
at
the
open
window
for
a
little
he
seemed
to
be
interested
in
something
a
great
way
off
we
used
to
read
ouida
books
together
he
said
somewhat
wistfully
lord
lord
how
she
revelled
in
chandos
and
bertie
cecil
and
those
dashing
life
guardsmen
and
she
used
to
toss
that
little
head
of
hers
and
say
i
was
a
finer
figure
of
a
man
than
any
of
thirty
years
ago
good
lord
and
i
was
then
but
i
ai
now
i
only
a
cantankerous
old
fool
declared
the
colonel
blowing
his
nose
violently
and
that
why
i
quarrelling
with
the
dearest
foolishest
daughter
man
ever
had
ah
my
dear
do
mind
me
run
your
menagerie
as
you
like
and
i
stand
it
margaret
adopted
her
usual
tactics
she
perched
herself
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
began
to
stroke
his
cheek
very
gently
she
often
wondered
as
to
what
dear
sort
of
a
woman
that
mother
of
the
old
miniature
had
been
the
mother
who
had
died
when
she
was
two
years
old
she
loved
the
idea
of
her
vague
as
it
was
and
just
now
somehow
the
notion
of
two
grown
people
reading
ouida
did
not
strike
her
as
being
especially
ridiculous
was
she
very
beautiful
she
asked
softly
my
dear
said
her
father
you
are
the
picture
of
her
you
dangerous
old
man
said
she
laughing
and
rubbing
her
cheek
against
his
in
a
manner
that
must
have
been
highly
agreeable
dear
do
you
know
that
is
the
nicest
little
compliment
i
had
for
a
long
time
thereupon
the
colonel
chuckled
pay
me
for
it
then
said
he
by
driving
the
over
to
meet
billy
train
eh
i
i
ca
said
miss
hugonin
promptly
why
demanded
her
father
because
said
miss
hugonin
and
after
giving
this
really
excellent
reason
reflected
for
a
moment
and
strengthened
it
by
adding
because
see
here
her
father
questioned
what
did
you
two
quarrel
about
anyway
i
i
really
do
remember
said
she
reflectively
then
continued
with
hauteur
and
some
inconsistency
i
am
not
aware
that
woods
and
i
have
ever
quarrelled
by
gad
then
said
the
colonel
you
may
as
well
prepare
to
for
i
intend
to
marry
you
to
billy
some
day
dear
dear
child
he
interpolated
with
malice
aforethought
have
you
a
fever
your
cheek
like
a
coal
billy
a
man
i
tell
you
worth
a
dozen
of
your
kennastons
and
charterises
i
like
billy
and
besides
it
only
right
he
should
have
selwoode
was
he
brought
up
to
expect
it
it
ai
right
he
should
lose
it
simply
because
he
had
a
quarrel
with
frederick
for
by
gad
not
to
speak
unkindly
of
the
dead
my
dear
frederick
quarrelled
with
every
one
he
ever
knew
from
the
woman
who
nursed
him
to
the
doctor
who
gave
him
his
last
pill
he
may
have
gotten
his
genius
for
from
heaven
but
he
certainly
got
his
temper
from
the
devil
i
really
believe
said
the
colonel
reflectively
it
was
worse
than
mine
yes
not
a
doubt
of
it
i
a
lamb
in
comparison
but
he
had
his
way
after
all
and
even
now
poor
billy
ca
get
selwoode
without
taking
you
with
it
and
he
caught
his
daughter
face
between
his
hands
and
turned
it
toward
his
for
a
moment
i
wonder
now
said
he
in
meditative
wise
if
billy
will
consider
that
a
drawback
it
seemed
very
improbable
any
number
of
marriageable
males
would
have
sworn
it
was
unthinkable
however
of
course
margaret
began
in
a
crisp
voice
if
you
advise
woods
to
marry
me
as
a
good
speculation
but
her
father
caught
her
up
with
a
whistle
eh
said
he
love
in
a
cottage
is
it
thus
the
poet
turns
his
lay
that
damn
nonsense
i
tell
you
even
in
a
cottage
the
plumber
bill
has
to
be
paid
and
the
grocer
little
account
settled
every
month
yes
by
gad
and
even
if
you
elect
to
live
on
bread
and
cheese
and
kisses
you
find
camembert
a
bit
more
to
your
taste
than
sweitzer
but
i
do
want
to
marry
anybody
you
ridiculous
old
dear
said
margaret
oh
very
well
said
the
old
gentleman
do
be
an
old
maid
and
lecture
before
the
mothers
club
if
you
like
i
do
care
anyhow
you
meet
billy
at
you
will
that
a
good
child
now
run
along
and
tell
the
menagerie
i
be
as
soon
as
i
finished
dressing
and
the
colonel
rang
for
his
man
and
proceeded
to
finish
his
toilet
he
seemed
a
thought
this
morning
i
say
wilkins
he
questioned
after
a
little
ever
read
any
of
ouida
books
ho
yes
sir
said
wilkins
miss
maid
that
his
sir
was
reading
haloud
hout
hof
two
flags
honly
last
hevening
sir
h
wilkins
if
you
can
run
across
one
of
them
in
the
quarters
you
might
leave
it
by
my
bed
yes
sir
and
h
wilkins
you
can
put
it
under
that
book
of
herbert
spencer
my
daughter
gave
me
yesterday
it
wilkins
and
h
wilkins
you
need
mention
it
to
anybody
ouida
ai
cultured
wilkins
but
she
damn
good
reading
i
suppose
that
why
she
cultured
wilkins
iii
and
now
let
us
go
back
a
little
in
a
word
let
us
utilise
the
next
twenty
minutes
during
which
miss
hugonin
drives
to
the
neighbouring
railway
station
in
if
you
press
me
not
the
most
pleasant
state
of
mind
conceivable
by
explaining
a
thought
more
fully
the
posture
of
affairs
at
selwoode
on
the
may
morning
that
starts
our
story
and
to
do
this
i
must
commence
with
the
nature
of
the
man
who
founded
selwoode
it
was
when
the
nineteenth
century
was
still
a
hearty
octogenarian
that
frederick
woods
caused
selwoode
to
be
builded
i
give
you
the
name
by
which
he
was
known
on
the
street
a
mythology
has
grown
about
the
name
since
and
strange
legends
of
its
owner
are
still
narrated
where
brokers
congregate
but
with
the
lambs
he
sheared
and
the
bulls
he
dragged
to
earth
and
the
bears
he
gored
to
financial
death
we
have
nothing
to
do
suffice
it
that
he
performed
these
operations
with
almost
uniform
success
and
in
an
unimpeachably
respectable
manner
and
if
in
his
time
he
added
materially
to
the
lists
of
inmates
in
various
asylums
and
almshouses
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
bore
his
victims
no
malice
and
that
on
every
sunday
morning
he
confessed
himself
to
be
a
miserable
sinner
in
a
voice
that
was
perfectly
audible
three
pews
off
at
bottom
i
think
he
considered
his
relations
with
heaven
on
a
purely
business
basis
he
kept
a
species
of
running
account
with
providence
and
if
on
occasions
he
overdrew
it
somewhat
he
saw
no
incongruity
in
evening
matters
with
a
cheque
for
the
church
fund
so
that
at
his
death
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
had
in
his
day
sent
more
men
into
bankruptcy
and
more
missionaries
into
africa
than
any
other
man
in
the
country
in
his
year
he
caught
alfred
van
orden
short
in
lard
erected
a
memorial
window
to
his
wife
and
became
a
country
gentleman
he
never
set
foot
in
wall
street
again
he
builded
selwoode
a
handsome
tudor
manor
which
stands
some
seven
miles
from
the
village
of
fairhaven
where
he
dwelt
in
state
by
turns
affable
and
domineering
to
the
neighbouring
farmers
and
evincing
a
grave
interest
in
the
condition
of
their
crops
he
no
longer
turned
to
the
financial
reports
in
the
papers
and
the
pedigree
of
the
woodses
hung
in
the
for
all
men
to
see
beginning
gloriously
with
woden
the
scandinavian
god
and
attaining
a
respectable
culmination
in
the
names
of
frederick
woods
and
of
william
his
brother
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
omitted
to
supply
himself
with
a
frederick
woods
evinced
an
almost
childlike
pride
in
his
heraldic
blazonings
the
woods
arms
he
would
inform
you
with
a
relishing
gusto
are
vert
an
eagle
displayed
barry
argent
and
gules
and
the
crest
is
out
of
a
ducal
coronet
or
a
proper
we
have
no
motto
sir
none
of
your
ancient
coats
have
mottoes
the
woods
eagle
he
gloried
in
the
bird
was
perched
in
every
available
nook
at
selwoode
it
was
carved
in
the
woodwork
was
set
in
the
mosaics
was
chased
in
the
tableware
was
woven
in
the
napery
was
glazed
in
the
very
china
turn
where
you
would
an
eagle
or
two
confronted
you
and
hunston
wyke
who
is
accounted
something
of
a
wit
swore
that
frederick
woods
at
selwoode
reminded
him
of
a
bear
who
had
taken
up
permanent
quarters
in
an
aviary
there
was
one
however
who
found
the
bear
no
very
untractable
monster
this
was
the
son
of
his
brother
dead
now
who
dwelt
at
selwoode
as
heir
presumptive
frederick
woods
wife
had
died
long
ago
leaving
him
childless
his
brother
boy
was
an
orphan
and
so
for
a
time
he
and
the
grim
old
man
lived
together
peaceably
enough
indeed
billy
woods
was
in
those
days
as
fine
a
lad
as
you
would
wish
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
an
inquisitive
cherub
and
a
big
which
frederick
woods
fell
into
the
habit
of
cuffing
heartily
in
order
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
would
have
burned
selwoode
to
the
ground
rather
than
allow
any
one
else
to
injure
a
hair
of
it
in
the
consummation
of
time
billy
having
attained
the
ripe
age
of
eighteen
announced
to
his
uncle
that
he
intended
to
become
a
famous
painter
frederick
woods
exhorted
him
not
to
be
a
fool
and
packed
him
off
to
college
billy
woods
returned
on
his
first
vacation
with
a
fragmentary
mustache
and
any
quantity
of
canvases
palettes
and
paraphernalia
frederick
woods
passed
over
the
mustache
and
had
the
painters
trappings
burned
by
the
second
footman
billy
promptly
purchased
another
lot
his
uncle
came
upon
them
one
morning
rubbed
his
chin
meditatively
for
a
moment
and
laughed
for
the
first
time
so
far
as
known
in
his
lifetime
then
he
tiptoed
to
his
own
apartments
lest
billy
the
lazy
young
rascal
was
still
abed
in
the
next
room
should
awaken
and
discover
his
knowledge
of
this
act
of
flat
rebellion
i
dare
say
the
old
gentleman
was
so
completely
accustomed
to
having
his
own
way
that
this
opposition
tickled
him
by
its
novelty
or
perhaps
he
recognised
in
billy
an
obstinacy
akin
to
his
own
or
perhaps
it
was
merely
that
he
loved
the
boy
in
any
event
he
never
again
alluded
to
the
subject
and
it
is
a
fact
that
when
billy
sent
for
carpenters
to
convert
an
upper
room
into
an
atelier
frederick
woods
spent
two
long
and
dreary
weeks
in
boston
in
order
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
entire
affair
billy
scrambled
through
college
somehow
in
the
allotted
four
years
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
returned
to
find
new
inmates
installed
at
selwoode
for
the
wife
of
frederick
woods
had
been
before
her
marriage
one
of
the
beautiful
anstruther
sisters
who
as
certain
new
yorkers
still
remember
those
grizzled
portly
fellows
who
prattle
on
provocation
of
jenny
lind
and
castle
garden
and
remember
everything
created
a
pronounced
furor
at
their
début
in
the
days
of
crinoline
and
the
grecian
bend
and
margaret
anstruther
as
they
will
tell
you
was
married
to
thomas
hugonin
then
a
gallant
cavalry
officer
in
the
service
of
her
majesty
the
empress
of
india
and
she
must
have
been
the
nicer
of
the
two
because
everybody
who
knew
her
says
that
margaret
hugonin
is
exactly
like
her
so
it
came
about
naturally
enough
that
billy
woods
now
an
if
you
please
and
not
a
little
proud
of
it
found
the
colonel
and
his
daughter
then
on
a
visit
to
this
country
installed
at
selwoode
as
guests
and
and
billy
was
and
margaret
was
nineteen
precisely
what
happened
i
am
unable
to
tell
you
billy
woods
claims
it
is
none
of
my
business
and
margaret
says
that
it
was
a
long
long
time
ago
and
she
really
ca
remember
but
i
fancy
we
can
all
form
a
very
fair
notion
of
what
is
most
likely
to
occur
when
two
sensible
normal
healthy
young
people
are
thrown
together
in
this
intimate
fashion
at
a
where
the
remaining
company
consists
of
two
elderly
gentlemen
billy
was
forced
to
be
polite
to
his
uncle
guest
and
margaret
could
well
be
discourteous
to
her
host
nephew
could
she
of
course
not
so
it
befell
in
the
course
of
time
that
frederick
woods
and
the
colonel
who
had
quickly
become
a
great
favourite
by
virtue
of
his
implicit
faith
in
the
eagle
and
in
woden
and
sir
percival
de
wode
of
hastings
and
flights
of
heraldic
fancy
and
had
augmented
his
popularity
by
his
really
brilliant
suggestion
of
wynkyn
de
worde
the
famous
printer
as
a
probable
collateral
relation
of
the
family
it
came
to
pass
i
say
that
the
two
gentlemen
nodded
over
their
port
and
chuckled
and
winked
at
one
another
and
agreed
that
the
thing
would
do
this
was
all
very
well
but
they
failed
to
make
allowances
for
the
inevitable
quarrel
and
the
subsequent
spectacle
of
the
gentleman
contemplating
suicide
and
the
lady
looking
wistfully
toward
a
nunnery
in
this
case
it
arose
i
believe
over
teddy
anstruther
who
for
a
cousin
was
undeniably
very
attentive
to
margaret
and
in
the
natural
course
of
events
they
would
have
made
it
up
before
the
week
was
out
had
not
frederick
woods
selected
this
very
moment
to
interfere
in
the
matter
ah
vieillesse
savait
the
blundering
old
man
summoned
billy
into
his
study
and
ordered
him
to
marry
margaret
hugonin
precisely
as
the
colonel
might
have
ordered
a
private
to
go
on
ten
days
earlier
billy
would
have
jumped
at
the
chance
ten
days
later
he
would
probably
have
suggested
it
himself
but
at
that
exact
moment
he
would
have
as
willingly
contemplated
matrimony
with
alecto
or
medusa
or
any
of
the
furies
accordingly
he
declined
frederick
woods
flew
into
a
pyrotechnical
display
of
temper
and
gave
him
his
choice
between
obeying
his
commands
and
leaving
his
house
forever
the
choice
in
fact
which
he
had
been
according
billy
at
very
brief
intervals
ever
since
the
boy
had
had
the
measles
fifteen
years
before
and
had
refused
to
take
the
proper
medicines
it
was
merely
his
usual
manner
of
expressing
a
request
or
a
suggestion
but
this
time
to
his
utter
horror
and
amaze
the
boy
took
him
at
his
word
and
left
selwoode
within
the
hour
billy
life
you
see
was
irrevocably
blighted
it
mattered
very
little
what
became
of
him
personally
he
did
care
in
the
least
but
as
for
that
fair
false
fickle
woman
perish
the
thought
sooner
a
thousand
deaths
no
he
would
go
to
paris
and
become
a
painter
of
worldwide
reputation
the
money
his
father
had
left
him
would
easily
suffice
for
his
simple
wants
and
some
day
the
observed
of
all
observers
in
some
bright
hall
of
gaiety
he
would
pass
her
coldly
by
with
a
cynical
smile
upon
his
lips
and
she
would
grow
pale
and
totter
and
fall
into
the
arms
of
the
bloated
silenus
for
whose
title
she
had
bartered
her
purely
superficial
charms
yes
upon
mature
deliberation
that
was
precisely
what
billy
decided
to
do
followed
dark
days
at
selwoode
frederick
woods
told
margaret
of
what
had
occurred
and
he
added
the
information
that
as
his
nearest
relative
he
intended
to
make
her
his
heir
then
margaret
did
what
i
would
scarcely
have
expected
of
margaret
she
turned
upon
him
like
a
virago
and
informed
frederick
woods
precisely
what
she
thought
of
him
she
acquainted
him
with
the
fact
that
he
was
a
sordid
grasping
beast
and
a
miser
and
a
tyrant
and
i
think
a
parricide
she
notified
him
that
he
was
thoroughly
unworthy
to
wipe
the
dust
off
his
nephew
shoes
an
office
toward
which
to
do
him
justice
he
had
never
shown
any
marked
aspirations
and
that
billy
had
acted
throughout
in
a
most
noble
and
sensible
manner
and
that
personally
she
would
marry
billy
woods
if
he
were
the
last
man
on
earth
for
she
had
always
despised
him
and
she
added
the
information
that
she
expected
to
die
shortly
and
she
hoped
they
would
both
be
sorry
and
subsequently
she
clapped
the
climax
by
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
bursting
into
tears
and
telling
him
he
was
the
dearest
old
man
in
the
world
and
that
she
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
herself
so
they
kissed
and
made
it
up
and
after
a
little
the
colonel
and
margaret
went
away
from
selwoode
and
frederick
woods
was
left
alone
to
nourish
his
anger
and
indignation
if
he
could
and
to
hunger
for
his
boy
whether
he
would
or
not
he
was
too
proud
to
seek
him
out
indeed
he
never
thought
of
that
and
so
he
waited
alone
in
his
fine
house
sick
at
heart
impotent
hoping
against
hope
that
the
boy
would
come
back
the
boy
never
came
no
the
boy
never
came
because
he
was
what
the
old
man
had
made
him
headstrong
and
wilful
and
obstinate
billy
had
been
thoroughly
spoiled
the
old
man
had
nurtured
his
pride
had
applauded
it
as
a
mark
of
proper
spirit
and
now
it
was
this
same
pride
that
had
robbed
him
of
the
one
thing
he
loved
in
all
the
world
so
at
last
the
weak
point
in
the
armour
of
this
sturdy
old
pharisee
was
found
and
fate
had
pierced
it
gaily
it
was
retribution
if
you
will
and
i
think
that
none
of
his
victims
in
the
street
none
of
the
countless
widows
and
orphans
that
he
had
made
suffered
more
bitterly
than
he
in
those
last
days
it
was
almost
two
years
after
billy
departure
from
selwoode
that
his
coming
to
rouse
frederick
woods
one
june
morning
found
him
dead
in
his
rooms
he
had
been
ailing
for
some
time
it
was
his
heart
the
doctors
said
and
i
think
that
it
was
though
not
precisely
in
the
sense
which
they
meant
the
man
found
him
seated
before
his
great
carved
desk
on
which
his
head
and
shoulders
had
fallen
forward
they
rested
on
a
sheet
of
paper
with
a
calculation
in
his
crabbed
old
hand
as
to
the
value
of
certain
properties
the
calculation
which
he
never
finished
and
underneath
was
a
mass
of
miscellaneous
papers
among
them
his
will
dated
the
day
after
billy
left
selwoode
in
which
frederick
woods
bequeathed
his
millions
unconditionally
to
margaret
hugonin
when
she
should
come
of
age
her
birthday
had
fallen
in
the
preceding
month
so
margaret
was
one
of
the
richest
women
in
america
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
if
many
men
had
loved
her
before
they
worshipped
her
now
or
at
least
said
they
did
and
after
all
their
protestations
were
the
only
means
she
had
of
judging
she
might
have
been
a
countess
and
it
must
be
owned
that
the
old
colonel
who
had
an
honest
reverence
for
a
title
saw
this
chance
lost
wistfully
and
she
might
have
married
any
number
of
grammarless
gentlemen
personally
unknown
to
her
whose
fervent
proposals
almost
every
mail
brought
in
and
besides
these
there
were
many
others
more
orthodox
in
their
wooing
some
of
whom
were
genuinely
in
love
with
margaret
hugonin
and
some
i
grieve
to
admit
it
who
were
genuinely
in
love
with
her
money
and
she
would
have
none
of
them
she
refused
them
all
with
the
utmost
civility
as
i
happen
to
know
how
i
learned
it
is
no
affair
of
yours
for
miss
hugonin
had
remarkably
keen
eyes
which
she
used
to
advantage
in
the
world
about
her
they
discovered
very
little
that
she
could
admire
she
was
none
the
happier
for
her
wealth
the
millions
overshadowed
her
personality
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
knew
that
most
people
regarded
her
simply
as
the
heiress
of
the
woods
fortune
an
unavoidable
encumbrance
attached
to
the
property
which
divers
gentlemen
were
willing
to
put
up
with
to
put
up
with
at
the
thought
her
pride
rose
in
a
hot
blush
and
it
must
be
confessed
she
sought
consolation
in
the
she
was
an
young
woman
as
the
sex
goes
and
she
saw
no
great
reason
there
why
a
man
should
go
mad
over
margaret
hugonin
this
decision
i
grant
you
was
preposterous
for
there
were
any
number
of
reasons
her
final
conclusion
however
was
for
the
future
to
regard
all
men
as
and
to
do
her
hair
differently
she
carried
out
both
resolutions
when
a
gentleman
grew
pressing
in
his
attentions
she
more
than
suspected
his
motives
and
when
she
eventually
declined
him
it
was
done
with
perfect
courtesy
but
the
glow
of
her
eyes
was
at
such
times
accentuated
to
a
marked
degree
meanwhile
the
eagle
brooded
undisturbed
at
selwoode
miss
hugonin
would
allow
nothing
to
be
altered
the
place
does
belong
to
me
attractive
she
would
tell
her
father
i
belong
to
the
place
yes
i
do
i
exactly
like
a
little
cow
thrown
in
with
a
little
farm
when
they
sell
it
and
my
little
suitors
think
so
and
they
are
very
willing
to
take
me
on
those
terms
too
but
they
sha
attractive
i
hate
every
single
solitary
man
in
the
whole
wide
world
but
you
beautiful
and
i
particularly
hate
that
horrid
old
eagle
but
we
keep
him
because
he
a
constant
reminder
to
me
that
solomon
or
moses
or
whoever
it
was
that
said
all
men
were
liars
was
a
person
of
great
intelligence
so
that
i
think
we
may
fairly
say
the
money
did
her
no
good
if
it
benefited
no
one
else
it
was
not
margaret
fault
she
had
a
high
sense
of
her
responsibilities
and
therefore
at
various
times
endeavoured
to
further
the
spread
of
philanthropy
and
literature
and
theosophy
and
art
and
temperance
and
education
and
other
laudable
causes
kennaston
in
his
laughing
manner
was
wont
to
jest
at
her
varied
enterprises
and
term
her
lady
bountiful
but
then
kennaston
had
no
real
conception
of
the
proper
uses
of
money
in
fact
he
never
thought
of
money
he
admitted
this
to
margaret
with
a
whimsical
sigh
margaret
grew
very
fond
of
kennaston
because
he
was
not
mercenary
kennaston
was
much
at
selwoode
many
people
came
there
now
masculine
women
and
muscleless
men
for
the
most
part
they
had
every
one
of
them
some
scheme
for
bettering
the
universe
and
if
among
them
margaret
seemed
somewhat
out
of
place
a
butterfly
among
ants
her
heart
was
in
every
plan
they
advocated
and
they
found
her
infinitely
elastic
the
girl
was
pitiably
anxious
to
be
of
some
use
in
the
world
so
at
selwoode
they
gossiped
of
great
causes
and
furthered
the
millenium
and
above
them
the
eagle
brooded
in
silence
and
billy
all
this
time
billy
was
junketing
abroad
where
every
year
he
painted
masterpieces
for
the
salon
which
on
account
of
a
nefarious
conspiracy
among
certain
artists
jealous
of
his
superior
merits
were
invariably
refused
now
billy
is
back
again
in
america
and
the
colonel
has
insisted
that
he
come
to
selwoode
and
margaret
is
waiting
for
him
in
the
the
glow
of
her
eyes
is
very
very
bright
her
father
careless
words
this
morning
coupled
with
certain
speeches
of
kennaston
last
night
have
given
her
food
for
reflection
he
would
dare
says
margaret
to
no
one
in
particular
oh
no
he
would
dare
after
what
happened
four
years
ago
and
she
has
quite
forgotten
that
what
happened
four
years
ago
was
all
caused
by
her
having
flirted
outrageously
with
teddy
anstruther
in
order
to
see
what
billy
would
do
iv
the
twelve
for
a
wonder
was
on
time
and
there
descended
from
it
a
big
blond
young
man
who
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
a
miss
hugonin
resented
this
manifestly
he
looked
clean
and
honest
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
deceiving
her
very
well
she
show
him
he
was
quite
unembarrassed
he
shook
hands
cordially
then
he
shook
hands
with
the
groom
who
you
may
believe
it
was
grinning
in
a
most
unprofessional
manner
because
master
billy
was
back
again
at
selwoode
subsequently
in
his
old
decisive
way
he
announced
they
would
walk
to
the
house
as
his
legs
needed
stretching
the
insolence
of
it
quite
as
if
he
had
something
to
say
to
margaret
in
private
and
could
wait
a
minute
beyond
doubt
this
was
a
young
man
who
must
be
taken
down
a
peg
or
two
and
that
at
once
of
course
she
was
going
to
walk
back
with
him
a
pretty
figure
they
cut
strolling
through
the
fields
like
a
and
the
milkman
on
a
sunday
afternoon
she
would
simply
say
she
was
too
tired
to
walk
and
that
would
end
the
matter
so
she
said
she
thought
the
exercise
would
do
them
both
good
they
came
presently
with
desultory
chat
to
a
meadow
bravely
decked
in
all
the
gauds
of
spring
about
them
the
day
was
clear
the
air
bland
spring
had
revamped
her
ageless
fripperies
of
tender
leaves
and
and
sweet
warm
odours
for
the
adornment
of
this
meadow
above
it
she
had
set
a
turkis
sky
splashed
here
and
there
with
little
clouds
that
were
like
whipped
cream
and
upon
it
she
had
scattered
largesse
a
danaë
shower
of
buttercups
altogether
she
had
made
of
it
a
particularly
dangerous
meadow
for
a
man
and
a
maid
to
frequent
yet
there
woods
paused
under
a
burgeoning
maple
paused
resolutely
with
the
lures
of
spring
thick
about
him
compassed
with
every
snare
of
scent
and
sound
and
colour
that
the
witch
is
mistress
of
margaret
hoped
he
had
a
pleasant
passage
over
her
father
thank
you
was
in
the
pink
of
condition
oh
yes
she
was
quite
well
she
hoped
woods
would
not
find
america
well
peggy
said
woods
then
we
have
it
out
right
here
his
insolence
was
so
surprising
that
in
order
to
recover
herself
margaret
actually
sat
down
under
the
peggy
indeed
why
she
had
been
called
peggy
for
no
not
for
four
whole
years
because
i
intend
to
be
friends
you
know
said
woods
and
about
them
the
made
a
little
island
of
sombre
green
around
which
more
vivid
grasses
rippled
and
dimpled
under
the
fitful
spring
breezes
and
everywhere
leaves
lisped
to
one
another
and
birds
shrilled
insistently
it
was
a
perilous
locality
i
fancy
billy
woods
was
out
of
his
head
when
he
suggested
being
friends
in
such
a
place
friends
indeed
you
would
have
thought
from
the
airy
confidence
with
which
he
spoke
that
margaret
had
come
safely
to
forty
year
and
wore
spectacles
but
miss
hugonin
merely
cast
down
her
eyes
and
was
aware
of
no
reason
why
they
should
be
she
was
sure
he
must
be
hungry
and
she
thought
luncheon
must
be
ready
by
now
in
his
soul
woods
observed
that
her
lashes
were
long
long
beyond
all
reason
lacking
the
numbers
that
petrarch
flowed
in
he
did
not
venture
even
to
himself
to
characterise
them
further
but
oh
how
queer
it
was
they
should
be
pure
gold
at
the
roots
she
must
have
dipped
them
in
the
and
oh
the
strong
sudden
bewildering
curve
of
he
could
not
recall
at
the
present
moment
ever
noticing
quite
such
lashes
anywhere
else
no
it
was
highly
improbable
that
there
were
such
lashes
anywhere
else
perhaps
a
few
of
the
superior
angels
might
have
such
lashes
he
resolved
for
the
future
to
attend
church
more
regularly
aloud
woods
observed
that
in
that
case
they
had
better
shake
hands
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
to
contest
the
point
the
dignified
course
was
to
shake
hands
since
he
insisted
on
it
and
then
to
return
at
once
to
selwoode
margaret
hugonin
had
a
pretty
hand
and
woods
as
an
artist
could
not
well
fail
to
admire
it
still
he
need
have
looked
at
it
as
though
he
had
never
before
seen
anything
quite
like
it
he
have
neglected
to
return
it
and
when
miss
hugonin
reclaimed
it
after
a
decent
interval
he
need
have
laughed
in
a
manner
that
compelled
her
to
laugh
too
these
things
were
unnecessary
and
annoying
as
they
caused
margaret
to
forget
that
she
despised
him
illustration
then
for
no
apparent
reason
margaret
flushed
and
billy
thought
it
vastly
becoming
for
the
time
being
will
you
believe
it
she
actually
thought
he
was
rather
nice
i
acted
like
an
ass
said
woods
tragically
oh
yes
i
did
you
know
but
if
you
forgive
me
for
having
been
an
ass
i
forgive
you
for
throwing
me
over
for
teddy
anstruther
and
at
the
wedding
dance
through
any
number
of
pairs
of
you
choose
to
mention
so
that
was
the
way
he
looked
at
it
teddy
anstruther
indeed
why
teddy
was
a
dark
little
man
with
brown
eyes
just
the
sort
of
man
she
most
objected
to
how
could
any
one
ever
possibly
fancy
a
man
then
for
no
apparent
reason
margaret
flushed
and
billy
who
had
stretched
his
great
length
of
limb
on
the
grass
beside
her
noted
it
with
a
pair
of
the
bluest
eyes
in
the
world
and
thought
it
vastly
becoming
billy
said
she
impulsively
and
the
name
having
slipped
out
once
by
accident
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
call
him
anything
else
afterward
it
was
horrid
of
you
to
refuse
to
take
any
of
that
money
but
i
did
want
it
he
protested
good
lord
i
only
have
done
something
foolish
with
it
it
was
awfully
square
of
you
peggy
to
offer
to
divide
but
i
did
want
it
you
see
i
do
want
to
be
a
millionaire
and
give
up
the
rest
of
my
life
to
founding
libraries
and
explaining
to
people
that
if
they
never
spend
any
money
on
amusements
they
have
a
great
deal
by
the
time
they
too
old
to
enjoy
it
rather
paint
pictures
so
that
i
think
margaret
must
have
endeavoured
at
some
time
to
make
him
accept
part
of
frederick
woods
money
you
make
me
feel
and
look
like
a
thief
she
reproved
him
then
billy
laughed
a
little
you
do
look
in
the
least
like
one
he
reassured
her
you
look
like
an
uncommonly
honest
straightforward
young
woman
woods
added
handsomely
and
i
do
believe
purloin
under
the
severest
temptation
she
thanked
him
for
his
testimonial
with
all
three
dimples
in
evidence
this
was
unsettling
he
hedged
except
perhaps
said
he
yes
queried
margaret
after
a
pause
however
she
questioned
him
with
her
head
drooped
forward
her
brows
raised
and
as
this
gave
him
the
full
effect
of
her
eyes
woods
became
quite
certain
that
there
was
at
least
one
thing
she
might
be
expected
to
rob
him
of
and
wisely
declined
to
mention
it
margaret
did
not
insist
on
knowing
what
it
was
perhaps
she
heard
it
thumping
under
his
waistcoat
where
it
was
behaving
very
queerly
so
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
then
margaret
fell
to
herself
and
the
air
will
you
believe
it
chanced
by
the
purest
accident
to
be
that
foolish
senseless
old
song
they
used
to
sing
together
four
years
ago
billy
chuckled
let
he
obscurely
pleaded
spring
prompted
her
oh
where
have
you
been
billy
boy
queried
margaret
wonderful
contralto
oh
where
have
you
been
billy
boy
billy
boy
oh
where
have
you
been
charming
billy
she
sang
it
in
a
low
hushed
voice
just
over
her
breath
not
looking
at
him
however
and
oh
what
a
voice
thought
billy
woods
a
voice
that
was
honey
and
gold
and
velvet
and
all
that
is
most
sweet
and
rich
and
soft
in
the
world
find
me
another
voice
like
that
you
donne
find
me
a
simile
for
it
you
uninventive
poets
indeed
like
to
see
you
do
it
but
he
chimed
in
nevertheless
with
his
pleasant
throaty
baritone
and
lilted
his
own
part
quite
creditably
i
been
to
seek
a
wife
she
the
joy
of
my
life
she
a
young
thing
and
can
not
leave
her
mother
only
billy
sang
it
father
just
as
they
used
to
do
and
then
they
sang
it
through
did
margaret
and
billy
sang
of
the
dimple
in
her
chin
and
the
ringlets
in
her
hair
and
of
the
cherry
pies
she
achieved
with
such
celerity
sang
as
they
sat
in
the
meadow
every
word
of
that
inane
old
song
that
is
so
utterly
senseless
and
so
utterly
unforgettable
it
was
a
quite
idiotic
performance
i
set
it
down
to
the
snares
of
spring
to
her
insidious
delightful
snares
of
scent
and
sound
and
colour
that
for
the
moment
at
least
had
trapped
these
young
people
into
loving
life
infinitely
but
i
wonder
who
is
responsible
for
that
tatter
of
rhyme
and
melody
that
had
come
to
them
from
nowhere
in
particular
woods
as
he
sat
up
at
the
conclusion
of
the
singing
vigorously
to
applaud
would
have
shared
his
last
possession
his
ultimate
crust
with
that
unknown
benefactor
of
mankind
indeed
though
the
heart
of
woods
just
now
was
full
of
loving
kindness
and
capable
of
any
freakish
magnanimity
for
will
it
be
believed
mr
woods
who
four
years
ago
had
thrown
over
a
fortune
and
exiled
himself
from
his
native
land
rather
than
propose
marriage
to
margaret
hugonin
had
no
sooner
come
again
into
her
presence
and
looked
once
into
her
perfectly
fathomless
eyes
than
he
could
no
more
have
left
her
of
his
own
accord
than
a
moth
can
turn
his
back
to
a
lighted
candle
he
had
fancied
himself
entirely
cured
of
that
nonsense
his
broken
heart
after
the
first
few
months
had
not
interfered
in
the
least
with
a
naturally
healthy
appetite
and
behold
here
was
the
old
malady
raging
again
in
his
veins
and
with
renewed
fervour
and
all
because
the
girl
had
a
pretty
face
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
in
the
conversation
i
have
recorded
margaret
had
not
displayed
any
great
wisdom
or
learning
or
tenderness
or
wit
nor
in
fine
any
of
the
qualities
a
man
might
naturally
look
for
in
a
helpmate
yet
at
the
precise
moment
he
handed
his
to
the
groom
woods
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
in
an
instant
he
had
fallen
head
over
ears
in
love
or
to
whittle
accuracy
to
a
point
he
had
discovered
that
he
had
never
fallen
out
of
love
and
if
you
had
offered
him
an
empress
or
fetched
helen
of
troy
from
the
grave
for
his
delectation
he
would
have
laughed
you
to
scorn
in
his
defense
i
can
only
plead
that
margaret
was
an
unusually
beautiful
woman
it
is
all
very
well
to
flourish
a
at
the
feast
and
bid
my
lady
go
paint
herself
an
inch
thick
for
to
this
favour
she
must
come
and
it
is
quite
true
that
the
reddest
lips
in
the
universe
may
give
vent
to
slander
and
lies
and
the
brightest
eyes
be
set
in
the
dullest
head
and
the
most
roseate
of
complexions
be
purchased
at
the
corner
but
say
what
you
will
a
pretty
woman
is
a
pretty
woman
and
while
she
continue
so
no
amount
of
or
experience
will
prevent
a
man
on
provocation
from
alluring
coaxing
even
entreating
her
to
make
a
fool
of
him
we
like
it
and
i
think
they
like
it
too
so
woods
lost
his
heart
on
a
fine
spring
morning
and
was
unreasonably
elated
over
the
fact
and
margaret
margaret
was
content
v
they
talked
for
a
matter
of
a
in
the
fashion
aforetime
recorded
not
very
wise
nor
witty
talk
if
you
will
but
very
pleasant
to
make
there
were
many
pauses
there
was
much
laughter
over
nothing
in
particular
there
were
any
number
of
sentences
ambitiously
begun
that
ended
nowhere
altogether
it
was
just
the
sort
of
talk
for
a
man
and
a
maid
yet
some
twenty
minutes
later
woods
preparing
for
luncheon
in
the
privacy
of
his
chamber
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
then
he
sat
down
and
rumpled
his
hair
thoroughly
good
lord
he
groaned
i
forgotten
all
about
that
damned
money
oh
you
ass
you
abject
ass
why
she
one
of
the
richest
women
in
america
and
you
only
a
painter
with
a
paltry
thousand
or
so
a
year
marry
her
why
i
dare
say
she
refused
a
hundred
better
men
than
you
she
think
you
were
mad
why
think
you
were
after
her
money
she
oh
she
only
think
you
a
precious
cheeky
ass
she
would
and
she
be
quite
right
you
an
ass
billy
woods
you
ought
to
be
locked
up
in
some
nice
quiet
stable
where
your
heehawing
would
disturb
people
you
need
a
keeper
you
do
he
sat
for
some
ten
minutes
aghast
afterward
he
rose
and
threw
back
his
shoulders
and
drew
a
deep
breath
no
we
are
an
ass
he
addressed
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
as
he
carefully
knotted
his
tie
we
only
a
poor
moth
who
been
looking
at
a
star
too
long
it
a
bright
star
billy
but
it
is
for
you
so
we
going
to
be
sensible
now
we
going
to
get
a
telegram
that
will
call
us
away
from
selwoode
we
are
coming
back
any
more
either
we
simply
going
to
continue
painting
pictures
and
hoping
that
some
day
she
find
the
right
man
and
be
very
very
happy
nevertheless
he
decided
that
a
blue
tie
would
look
better
and
was
very
particular
in
arranging
it
at
the
same
moment
margaret
stood
before
her
mirror
and
tidied
her
hair
for
luncheon
and
assured
her
image
in
the
glass
that
she
was
a
fool
she
pointed
out
to
herself
the
undeniable
fact
that
billy
having
formerly
refused
to
marry
her
oh
ignominy
seemed
enough
now
that
she
had
become
an
heiress
his
refusal
to
accept
part
of
her
fortune
was
a
very
flimsy
device
it
simply
meant
he
hoped
to
get
all
of
it
oh
he
did
did
he
margaret
powdered
her
nose
viciously
saw
through
him
his
honest
bearing
she
very
plainly
perceived
to
be
the
result
of
consummate
hypocrisy
in
his
laughter
her
keen
ear
detected
a
hollow
ring
and
his
courteous
manner
she
found
at
bottom
mere
servility
and
finally
she
demonstrated
to
her
own
satisfaction
at
least
that
his
charm
of
manner
was
of
exactly
the
same
sort
that
had
been
possessed
by
many
other
eminently
distinguished
criminals
how
did
she
do
this
my
dear
sir
you
had
best
inquire
of
your
mother
or
your
sister
or
your
wife
or
any
other
lady
that
your
fancy
dictates
they
know
i
am
sure
i
do
and
after
it
all
oh
dear
dear
said
margaret
i
wish
he
did
have
such
nice
eyes
vi
on
the
way
to
luncheon
woods
came
upon
adèle
haggage
and
hugh
van
orden
both
of
whom
he
knew
very
much
engrossed
in
one
another
in
a
nook
under
the
stairway
to
billy
it
seemed
just
now
quite
proper
that
every
one
should
be
in
love
was
it
after
all
the
most
pleasant
condition
in
the
world
so
he
greeted
them
with
a
smile
that
caused
adèle
to
flush
a
little
for
she
was
let
us
say
interested
in
van
orden
that
was
tolerably
well
known
in
fact
margaret
prompted
by
haggage
it
must
be
confessed
had
invited
him
to
selwoode
for
the
especial
purpose
of
entertaining
miss
adèle
haggage
for
he
was
a
good
match
and
haggage
as
an
experienced
chaperon
knew
the
value
of
country
houses
very
unexpectedly
however
the
boy
had
developed
a
disconcerting
tendency
to
fall
in
love
with
margaret
who
snubbed
him
promptly
and
unmercifully
he
had
accordingly
fallen
back
on
adèle
and
haggage
had
regained
both
her
trust
in
providence
and
her
temper
in
the
where
luncheon
was
laid
out
the
colonel
greeted
woods
with
the
enthusiasm
a
sailor
shipwrecked
on
a
desert
island
might
conceivably
display
toward
the
come
to
rescue
him
the
colonel
liked
billy
and
furthermore
the
poor
position
at
selwoode
just
now
was
not
utterly
unlike
that
of
the
suppositious
mariner
were
i
minded
to
venture
into
metaphor
i
should
picture
him
as
clinging
desperately
to
the
rock
of
an
old
fogeyism
and
surrounded
by
weltering
seas
of
advanced
thought
colonel
hugonin
himself
was
not
advanced
in
his
ideas
also
he
had
forceful
opinions
as
to
the
ultimate
destination
of
those
who
were
then
billy
was
presented
to
the
men
of
the
party
felix
kennaston
and
petheridge
jukesbury
haggage
he
knew
slightly
and
kathleen
saumarez
he
had
known
very
well
indeed
some
six
years
previously
before
she
had
ever
heard
of
miguel
saumarez
and
when
billy
was
still
an
undergraduate
she
was
a
widow
now
and
not
and
woods
first
thought
on
seeing
her
was
that
a
man
was
a
fool
to
write
verses
and
that
she
looked
like
just
the
sort
of
woman
to
preserve
them
his
second
was
that
he
had
verged
on
imbecility
when
he
fancied
he
admired
that
slender
type
a
woman
hair
ought
to
be
an
enormous
coronal
of
sunlight
a
woman
ought
to
have
very
large
candid
eyes
of
a
colour
between
that
of
sapphires
and
that
of
the
spring
heavens
only
infinitely
more
beautiful
than
either
and
all
petticoated
persons
differing
from
this
description
were
manifestly
quite
unworthy
of
any
serious
consideration
so
his
eyes
turned
to
margaret
who
had
no
eyes
for
him
she
had
forgotten
his
existence
with
an
utterness
that
verged
on
ostentation
and
if
it
had
been
any
one
else
billy
would
have
surmised
she
was
in
a
temper
but
that
angel
in
a
temper
nonsense
and
oh
what
eyes
she
had
and
what
lashes
and
what
hair
and
altogether
how
adorable
she
was
and
what
a
wonder
the
admiring
gods
had
snatched
her
up
to
olympus
long
ago
thus
far
woods
but
if
miss
hugonin
was
somewhat
taciturn
her
counsellors
in
divers
schemes
for
benefiting
the
universe
were
in
opulent
vein
billy
heard
them
silently
i
have
spent
the
entire
morning
by
the
lake
kennaston
informed
the
party
at
large
in
company
with
a
who
was
practising
a
new
aria
it
was
a
wonderful
place
the
trees
were
lisping
verses
to
themselves
and
the
sky
overhead
was
like
a
robin
egg
in
colour
and
a
faint
wind
was
making
tucks
and
ruches
and
pleats
all
over
the
water
quite
as
if
the
breezes
had
set
up
in
business
as
i
fancy
they
thought
they
were
working
on
a
great
sheet
of
blue
silk
for
it
was
very
like
that
and
every
once
in
a
while
a
fish
would
leap
and
leave
a
splurge
of
bubble
and
foam
behind
that
you
would
have
sworn
was
an
inserted
lace
medallion
kennaston
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
is
the
author
of
the
king
quest
and
other
volumes
of
verse
he
is
a
young
man
with
hair
of
no
particular
shade
and
if
his
green
eyes
are
a
little
aged
his
manner
is
very
youthful
his
voice
in
speaking
is
wonderfully
pleasing
and
he
has
a
habit
of
cocking
his
head
on
one
side
in
a
fashion
indeed
petheridge
jukesbury
observed
it
is
very
true
that
god
made
the
country
and
man
made
the
town
a
little
more
wine
please
jukesbury
is
a
prominent
worker
in
the
cause
of
philanthropy
and
temperance
he
is
ponderous
and
bland
and
for
the
rest
he
is
president
of
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
nicotine
and
the
nude
of
the
league
secretary
of
the
incorporated
brotherhood
of
benevolence
and
the
bearer
of
divers
similar
honours
i
am
never
really
happy
in
the
country
saumarez
dissented
it
reminds
me
so
constantly
of
our
rural
drama
i
am
always
afraid
the
quartette
may
come
on
and
sing
something
kathleen
eppes
saumarez
as
i
hope
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
is
the
lecturer
before
women
clubs
and
the
author
of
many
sympathetic
stories
of
nature
and
animal
life
of
the
kind
that
have
had
such
a
vogue
of
late
there
was
always
an
indefinable
air
of
pathos
about
her
as
hunston
wyke
put
it
one
felt
somehow
that
her
mother
had
been
of
a
domineering
disposition
and
that
she
took
after
her
father
ah
dear
lady
kennaston
cried
playfully
you
like
many
of
us
have
become
an
alien
to
nature
in
your
quest
of
a
mere
earthly
paradox
epigrams
are
all
very
well
but
i
fancy
there
is
more
happiness
to
be
derived
from
a
single
impulse
from
a
vernal
wood
than
from
a
whole
of
smart
sayings
so
few
of
us
are
natural
kennaston
complained
with
a
dulcet
sigh
we
are
too
sophisticated
our
very
speech
lacks
the
tang
of
outdoor
life
why
should
we
not
love
nature
the
great
mother
who
is
i
grant
you
the
necessity
of
various
useful
inventions
in
her
angry
moods
but
who
in
her
kindly
moments
he
paused
with
a
wry
face
i
beg
your
pardon
said
he
but
i
believe
i
caught
rheumatism
lying
by
that
confounded
pond
saumarez
rallied
the
poet
with
a
pale
smile
that
comes
of
communing
with
nature
she
reminded
him
and
it
serves
you
rightly
for
natural
communications
corrupt
good
epigrams
i
prefer
nature
with
wide
margins
and
uncut
leaves
she
spoke
in
her
best
platform
manner
art
should
be
an
expurgated
edition
of
nature
with
all
the
unpleasant
parts
left
out
and
i
am
sure
saumarez
added
handsomely
and
clinching
her
argument
that
kennaston
gives
us
much
better
sunsets
in
his
poems
than
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
west
he
acknowledged
this
with
a
bow
not
sherry
claret
if
you
please
said
jukesbury
art
should
be
an
expurgated
edition
of
nature
he
repeated
with
a
suave
chuckle
do
you
know
i
consider
that
admirably
put
saumarez
admirably
upon
my
word
ah
if
our
writers
would
only
take
that
saying
to
heart
we
do
not
need
to
be
told
of
the
vice
and
corruption
prevalent
i
am
sorry
to
say
among
the
very
best
people
what
we
really
need
is
continually
to
be
reminded
of
the
fact
that
pure
hearts
and
homes
and
happy
faces
are
to
be
found
alike
in
the
palatial
residences
of
the
wealthy
and
in
the
humbler
homes
of
those
less
abundantly
favoured
by
fortune
and
yet
dwelling
together
in
harmony
and
christian
resignation
and
er
comparatively
moderate
circumstances
surely
saumarez
protested
art
has
nothing
to
do
with
morality
art
is
a
process
you
see
a
thing
in
a
certain
way
you
make
your
reader
see
it
in
the
same
way
or
try
to
if
you
succeed
the
result
is
art
if
you
fail
it
may
be
the
book
of
the
year
enduring
immortality
and
ah
the
patronage
of
the
reading
public
jukesbury
placidly
insisted
will
be
awarded
in
the
end
only
to
those
who
dwell
upon
the
true
the
beautiful
and
the
er
respectable
art
must
cheer
it
must
be
optimistic
and
edifying
and
ah
suitable
for
young
persons
it
must
have
an
uplift
a
leaven
of
righteousness
a
er
a
sort
of
moral
it
must
utterly
eschew
the
ah
unpleasant
and
repugnant
details
of
life
it
is
if
i
may
so
express
myself
not
at
home
in
the
ménage
à
trois
or
er
the
representation
of
the
nude
yes
another
glass
of
claret
if
you
please
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
haggage
in
her
deep
voice
sarah
ellen
haggage
is
of
course
the
author
of
in
the
south
and
the
and
other
notable
contributions
to
literature
she
is
also
the
madame
president
both
of
the
society
for
the
betterment
of
civic
government
and
sewerage
and
of
the
ladies
league
for
the
edification
of
the
impecunious
and
i
am
glad
to
see
haggage
presently
went
on
that
the
literature
of
the
day
is
so
largely
beginning
to
chronicle
the
sayings
and
doings
of
the
labouring
classes
the
virtues
of
the
humble
must
be
admitted
in
spite
of
their
dissolute
and
unhygienic
tendencies
yes
haggage
added
meditatively
our
literature
is
undoubtedly
acquiring
a
more
elevated
tone
at
last
we
are
shaking
off
the
scintillant
and
unwholesome
influence
of
the
french
ah
the
french
sighed
kennaston
a
people
who
think
depravity
the
soul
of
wit
their
art
is
mere
artfulness
they
care
nothing
for
nature
no
haggage
assented
they
prefer
nastiness
french
books
are
immoral
i
ran
across
one
the
other
day
that
was
simply
hideously
indecent
unfit
for
a
modest
woman
to
read
and
i
can
assure
you
that
none
of
its
author
other
books
are
any
better
i
purchased
the
entire
set
at
once
and
read
them
carefully
in
order
to
make
sure
that
i
was
perfectly
justified
in
warning
my
classes
against
them
i
wish
to
misjudge
no
man
not
even
a
member
of
a
nation
notoriously
devoted
to
absinthe
and
illicit
relations
she
breathed
heavily
and
looked
at
woods
as
if
somehow
he
was
responsible
then
she
gave
the
name
of
the
book
to
petheridge
jukesbury
he
wished
to
have
it
placed
on
the
of
the
brotherhood
of
benevolence
he
said
dear
dear
felix
kennaston
sighed
as
jukesbury
made
a
note
of
it
you
are
all
so
practical
you
perceive
an
evil
and
proceed
at
once
in
your
way
to
crush
it
to
stamp
it
out
now
i
can
merely
lament
certain
unfortunate
tendencies
of
the
age
i
am
quite
unable
to
contend
against
them
do
you
know
kenneston
continued
gaily
as
he
trifled
with
a
bunch
of
grapes
i
feel
horribly
among
you
here
is
saumarez
creating
an
epidemic
of
useful
and
improving
knowledge
throughout
the
country
by
means
of
her
charming
lectures
here
is
haggage
the
mainspring
if
i
may
say
so
of
any
number
of
educational
and
philanthropic
alarm
clocks
which
will
some
day
rouse
the
sleeping
public
from
its
lethargy
and
here
is
my
friend
jukesbury
whose
eloquent
pleas
for
a
higher
life
have
turned
so
many
workmen
from
gin
and
improvidence
and
which
in
a
printed
form
are
disseminated
even
in
such
remote
regions
as
africa
where
i
am
told
they
have
produced
the
most
satisfactory
results
upon
the
unsophisticated
but
polygamous
monarchs
of
that
continent
and
here
above
all
is
miss
hugonin
utilising
the
vast
power
of
money
which
i
am
credibly
informed
is
a
very
good
thing
to
have
though
i
can
not
pretend
to
speak
from
experience
and
casting
whole
bakeryfuls
of
bread
upon
the
waters
of
charity
and
here
am
i
the
idle
singer
of
an
empty
day
a
mere
drone
in
this
hive
of
philanthropic
bees
dear
dear
said
kennaston
enviously
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
practical
and
he
laughed
toward
margaret
in
his
whimsical
way
miss
hugonin
had
been
strangely
silent
but
she
returned
kennaston
smile
and
began
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
you
only
an
ignorant
child
she
rebuked
him
and
a
very
naughty
child
too
to
make
fun
of
us
in
this
fashion
yes
kennaston
assented
i
am
wilfully
ignorant
the
world
adores
ignorance
and
where
ignorance
is
kissed
it
is
folly
to
be
wise
i
shall
read
you
a
chapter
from
my
of
ignorance
which
my
confiding
publisher
is
going
to
bring
out
in
the
autumn
so
the
went
on
and
now
margaret
bore
a
part
therein
however
i
do
not
think
we
need
record
it
further
woods
listened
in
a
sort
of
a
daze
adèle
haggage
and
hugh
van
orden
were
conversing
in
low
tones
at
one
end
of
the
table
the
colonel
was
eating
his
luncheon
silently
and
with
a
certain
air
of
resignation
and
so
billy
woods
was
left
alone
to
attend
and
marvel
the
ideas
they
advanced
seemed
to
him
for
the
most
part
sensible
what
puzzled
him
was
the
uniform
gravity
which
they
accorded
equally
as
it
appeared
to
him
to
the
discussion
of
the
most
pompous
platitudes
and
of
the
most
arrant
nonsense
they
were
always
serious
and
the
general
tone
of
infallibility
billy
thought
could
be
warranted
only
by
a
vast
fund
of
inexperience
but
in
the
main
they
advocated
theories
he
had
always
held
excellent
theories
he
considered
and
he
was
seized
with
an
unreasonable
desire
to
repudiate
every
one
of
them
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
one
of
them
was
aimed
at
approval
it
did
not
matter
to
whom
a
remark
was
ostensibly
addressed
always
at
its
conclusion
the
speaker
glanced
more
or
less
openly
toward
miss
hugonin
she
was
the
audience
to
which
they
zealously
played
thought
billy
and
he
wondered
i
think
i
have
said
that
owing
to
the
smallness
of
the
luncheon
was
served
in
the
the
at
selwoode
is
very
rarely
used
because
margaret
declares
its
size
makes
a
meal
there
equivalent
to
eating
and
i
must
confess
that
the
is
far
cosier
the
room
in
the
first
place
is
of
reasonable
dimensions
it
is
hung
with
flemish
tapestries
from
designs
by
van
eyck
representing
the
four
seasons
but
the
walls
and
ceiling
are
panelled
in
oak
and
over
the
mantel
carved
in
the
inevitable
eagle
is
displayed
the
mantel
stood
behind
margaret
chair
and
over
her
golden
head
with
his
wings
outstretched
to
the
uttermost
the
eagle
brooded
as
he
had
once
brooded
over
frederick
woods
the
old
man
sat
contentedly
beneath
that
symbol
of
what
he
had
achieved
in
life
he
had
started
as
the
phrase
runs
from
nothing
he
had
made
himself
a
power
to
him
the
eagle
meant
that
crude
incalculable
power
of
wealth
he
gloried
in
and
to
billy
woods
the
eagle
meant
identically
the
same
thing
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
began
to
suspect
that
the
eagle
was
really
the
audience
to
whom
miss
hugonin
friends
so
zealously
played
perhaps
the
misanthropy
of
woods
was
not
wholly
unconnected
with
the
fact
that
margaret
never
looked
at
him
show
him
the
so
her
eyes
never
strayed
toward
him
and
her
attention
never
left
him
at
the
end
of
luncheon
she
could
have
enumerated
for
you
every
morsel
he
had
eaten
every
glare
he
had
directed
toward
kennaston
every
beseeching
look
he
had
turned
to
her
of
course
he
had
taken
sherry
dry
sherry
had
he
told
her
four
years
ago
it
was
the
first
day
she
had
ever
worn
the
white
organdie
dotted
with
purple
sprigs
and
they
sat
by
the
lake
so
late
that
afternoon
that
frederick
woods
finally
sent
for
them
to
come
to
dinner
had
he
told
her
then
that
only
women
and
children
cared
for
sweet
wines
of
course
he
had
the
villain
illustration
billy
woods
billy
too
had
his
emotions
to
hear
that
paragon
that
queen
among
women
descant
of
work
done
in
the
slums
and
of
the
mysteries
of
to
hear
her
state
that
there
were
seventeen
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
children
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
fifteen
years
employed
in
the
mines
and
factories
of
the
united
states
to
hear
her
discourse
of
foreign
missions
as
glibly
as
though
she
had
been
born
and
nurtured
in
zambesi
land
all
these
things
filled
him
with
an
odd
sense
of
alienation
he
was
worthy
of
her
and
that
was
a
fact
he
was
only
a
dumb
idiot
and
half
the
words
that
were
falling
thick
and
fast
from
philanthropic
lips
about
him
might
as
well
have
been
hailstones
for
all
the
benefit
he
was
deriving
from
them
he
could
understand
half
she
said
in
consequence
he
very
cordially
detested
the
people
who
could
especially
that
grimacing
ass
kennaston
altogether
neither
woods
nor
miss
hugonin
got
much
comfort
from
their
luncheon
vii
after
luncheon
billy
had
a
quiet
with
the
colonel
in
the
said
billy
between
puffs
of
a
cigar
peggy
changed
a
bit
the
colonel
grunted
perhaps
he
dared
not
trust
to
words
seems
to
have
made
some
new
friends
a
more
vigorous
grunt
cultured
lot
they
seem
said
woods
anxious
to
do
good
in
the
world
too
philanthropic
set
eh
a
snort
this
time
eh
said
woods
there
was
dawning
suspicion
in
his
tone
the
colonel
looked
about
him
my
boy
said
he
you
thank
your
stars
you
did
get
that
money
and
depend
upon
it
there
never
was
a
yet
that
was
followed
pirates
billy
woods
suggested
helpfully
pirates
are
human
beings
said
colonel
hugonin
with
dignity
sharks
my
boy
sharks
viii
that
evening
after
proper
deliberation
célestine
miss
hugonin
commanded
get
out
that
little
yellow
dress
with
the
little
red
bandanna
handkerchiefs
on
it
and
for
heaven
sake
stop
pulling
my
hair
out
by
the
roots
unless
you
want
a
maniac
on
your
hands
célestine
whereby
she
had
landed
me
in
a
quandary
for
how
pray
is
it
possible
for
me
a
male
fittingly
to
depict
for
you
the
clothes
of
margaret
the
innumerable
vanities
the
quaint
devices
the
pleasing
conceits
with
which
she
delighted
to
enhance
her
comeliness
the
thing
is
beyond
me
let
us
keep
discreetly
out
of
her
wardrobe
you
and
i
otherwise
i
should
have
to
prattle
of
an
infinity
of
mysteries
of
her
scarfs
feathers
laces
gloves
girdles
knots
hats
shoes
fans
and
slippers
of
her
embroideries
rings
pins
pendants
ribbons
spangles
bracelets
and
chains
in
fine
there
would
be
no
end
to
the
list
of
gewgaws
that
went
to
make
margaret
hugonin
even
more
adorable
than
nature
had
fashioned
her
for
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
takes
the
craft
and
skill
and
of
a
thousand
men
to
dress
one
girl
properly
and
in
margaret
case
i
protest
that
every
one
of
them
could
he
have
beheld
the
result
of
their
united
labours
would
have
so
gloried
in
his
own
part
therein
that
there
would
have
been
no
putting
up
with
any
of
the
lot
yet
when
i
think
of
the
tiny
shoes
she
affected
ones
mostly
with
a
seam
running
straight
up
the
middle
and
you
may
guess
the
exact
date
of
our
comedy
by
knowing
in
what
year
these
shoes
were
modish
the
string
of
fat
pearls
she
so
often
wore
about
her
round
full
throat
the
white
frock
say
with
arabesques
of
blue
all
over
it
that
felix
kennaston
said
reminded
him
of
ruskin
tombstone
or
that
other
one
that
was
which
i
swear
seraphic
had
woven
out
of
mists
and
the
skies
of
june
when
i
remember
these
things
i
repeat
almost
am
i
tempted
to
become
a
and
a
lapidary
and
a
milliner
and
in
fine
an
adept
in
all
the
other
arts
and
trades
and
sciences
that
go
to
make
a
american
girl
what
she
is
the
incredible
fruit
of
grafted
centuries
the
period
after
the
list
of
achievements
just
that
i
might
describe
margaret
to
you
properly
but
the
thing
is
beyond
me
i
leave
such
considerations
then
to
célestine
and
resolve
for
the
future
rigorously
to
eschew
all
such
gauds
meanwhile
if
an
untutored
masculine
description
will
content
you
margaret
i
have
on
reliable
feminine
authority
was
one
of
the
very
few
blondes
whose
complexions
can
carry
off
reds
and
yellows
this
particular
gown
i
remember
it
perfectly
was
of
a
dim
dull
yellow
flounciful
if
i
may
coin
a
word
diaphanous
expansive
i
have
not
the
least
notion
what
fabric
composed
it
but
scattered
about
it
in
unexpected
places
were
red
things
that
i
am
credibly
informed
are
called
medallions
the
general
effect
of
it
may
be
briefly
characterised
as
grateful
to
the
eye
and
dangerous
to
the
heart
and
to
a
rational
train
of
thought
quite
fatal
for
it
was
cut
low
in
the
neck
and
margaret
neck
and
shoulders
would
have
drawn
madrigals
from
a
bench
of
bishops
and
in
consequence
billy
woods
ate
absolutely
no
dinner
that
evening
ix
it
was
an
hour
or
two
later
when
the
moon
drifting
tardily
up
from
the
south
found
miss
hugonin
and
kennaston
chatting
amicably
together
in
the
court
at
selwoode
they
were
discussing
the
deplorable
tendencies
of
the
modern
drama
the
court
at
selwoode
lies
in
the
angle
of
the
building
the
ground
plan
of
which
is
its
two
outer
sides
are
formed
by
covered
cloisters
leading
to
the
and
by
moonlight
the
night
bland
and
sweet
with
the
odour
of
growing
things
vocal
with
plashing
fountains
spangled
with
that
flicker
indolently
among
a
glimmering
concourse
of
nymphs
and
fauns
eternally
postured
in
flight
or
in
pursuit
by
moonlight
i
say
the
court
at
selwoode
is
perhaps
as
satisfactory
a
spot
for
a
as
this
transitory
world
affords
kennaston
was
in
vein
he
scintillated
he
was
also
a
little
nervous
this
was
probably
owing
to
the
fact
that
margaret
leaning
against
the
back
of
the
stone
bench
on
which
they
both
sat
her
chin
propped
by
her
hand
was
gazing
at
him
in
that
peculiar
intent
fashion
of
hers
which
as
i
think
i
have
mentioned
caused
you
fatuously
to
believe
she
had
forgotten
there
were
any
other
trousered
beings
extant
kennaston
however
stuck
to
apt
phrases
and
nice
distinctions
the
moon
found
it
edifying
but
rather
dull
after
a
little
kennaston
paused
in
his
boyish
ebullient
speech
and
they
sat
in
silence
the
lisping
of
the
fountains
was
very
audible
in
the
heavens
the
moon
climbed
a
little
further
and
registered
a
manifestly
impossible
hour
on
the
it
also
brightened
it
was
a
companionable
sort
of
a
moon
it
invited
talk
of
a
confidential
nature
bless
my
soul
it
was
signalling
to
any
number
of
gentlemen
at
that
moment
there
only
you
and
i
and
the
girl
here
speak
out
man
she
have
you
now
if
she
ever
will
you
never
have
a
chance
like
this
again
i
can
tell
you
come
now
my
dear
boy
i
shining
full
in
your
face
and
you
no
idea
how
becoming
it
is
i
not
like
that
garish
blundering
sun
who
does
know
any
better
than
to
let
her
see
how
red
and
fidgetty
you
get
when
you
excited
i
an
old
hand
at
such
matters
i
presided
over
these
little
affairs
since
babylon
was
a
paltry
village
never
tell
and
and
if
anything
should
happen
i
always
ready
to
go
behind
a
cloud
you
know
so
speak
out
speak
out
man
if
you
the
heart
of
a
mouse
thus
far
the
conscienceless
spring
moon
kennaston
sighed
the
moon
took
this
as
a
promising
sign
and
brightened
over
it
perceptibly
and
thereby
afforded
him
an
excellent
gambit
yes
said
margaret
what
is
it
beautiful
that
in
privacy
was
her
fantastic
name
for
him
the
poet
laughed
a
little
beautiful
child
said
he
and
that
under
similar
circumstances
was
his
perfectly
reasonable
name
for
her
i
have
been
discourteous
to
be
frank
i
have
been
sulking
as
irrationally
as
a
baby
who
clamours
for
the
moon
yonder
you
are
really
anything
but
a
baby
you
know
indeed
margaret
almost
thought
of
him
as
such
he
was
so
delightfully
naïf
he
bent
toward
her
a
faint
tremor
woke
in
his
speech
and
so
said
he
softly
i
cry
for
the
moon
the
unattainable
exquisite
moon
it
is
very
ridiculous
is
it
not
but
he
did
not
look
at
the
moon
he
looked
toward
margaret
past
margaret
toward
the
gleaming
windows
of
selwoode
where
the
eagle
brooded
oh
i
really
ca
say
margaret
cried
in
haste
she
was
kind
to
endymion
you
know
we
will
hope
for
the
best
i
think
we
better
go
into
the
house
now
you
bid
me
hope
said
he
beautiful
if
you
really
want
the
moon
i
do
see
the
objection
to
your
continuing
to
hope
they
make
so
many
little
airships
and
things
nowadays
you
know
and
you
probably
find
it
only
green
cheese
after
all
what
green
cheese
i
wonder
it
sounds
horribly
indigestible
and
unattractive
does
it
miss
hugonin
babbled
in
a
tumult
of
fear
and
disappointment
he
was
about
to
spoil
their
friendship
now
men
were
so
utterly
inconsiderate
a
little
cold
said
she
mendaciously
i
really
must
go
in
he
detained
her
surely
he
breathed
you
must
know
what
i
have
so
long
wanted
to
tell
you
i
have
the
idea
she
protested
promptly
you
can
tell
me
all
about
it
in
the
morning
i
have
some
accounts
to
cast
up
besides
i
not
a
good
person
to
tell
secrets
to
you
you
much
better
not
tell
me
oh
really
kennaston
she
cried
earnestly
you
much
better
not
tell
me
ah
margaret
margaret
he
pleaded
i
am
not
adamant
i
am
only
a
man
with
a
man
heart
that
hungers
for
you
cries
for
you
clamours
for
you
day
by
day
i
love
you
beautiful
child
love
you
with
a
poet
love
that
is
alien
to
these
sordid
days
with
a
love
that
is
half
worship
i
love
you
as
leander
loved
his
hero
as
pyramus
loved
thisbe
ah
child
child
how
beautiful
you
are
you
are
fairest
of
created
women
child
fair
as
those
queens
for
whose
smiles
old
cities
burned
and
kingdoms
were
lightly
lost
i
am
mad
for
love
of
you
ah
have
pity
upon
me
margaret
for
i
love
you
very
tenderly
he
delivered
these
observations
with
appropriate
fervour
kennaston
said
she
i
am
sorry
we
got
along
so
nicely
before
and
i
was
proud
of
your
friendship
we
had
such
good
times
together
you
and
i
and
i
liked
your
verses
so
and
i
liked
you
oh
please
let
keep
on
being
just
friends
margaret
wailed
piteously
friends
he
cried
and
gave
a
bitter
laugh
i
was
never
friends
with
you
margaret
why
even
as
i
read
my
verses
to
you
those
pallid
ineffectual
verses
that
praised
you
timorously
under
varied
names
even
then
there
pulsed
in
my
veins
the
riotous
pæan
of
love
the
great
mad
song
of
love
that
shamed
my
paltry
rhymes
i
can
not
be
friends
with
you
child
i
must
have
all
or
nothing
bid
me
hope
or
go
miss
hugonin
meditated
for
a
moment
and
did
neither
beautiful
she
presently
queried
would
you
be
very
very
much
shocked
if
i
descended
to
slang
i
think
said
he
with
an
uncertain
smile
that
i
could
endure
it
why
then
cut
it
out
beautiful
cut
it
out
i
do
believe
a
word
you
said
in
the
first
place
and
anyhow
it
annoys
me
to
have
you
talk
to
me
like
that
i
do
like
it
and
it
simply
makes
me
awfully
awfully
tired
with
which
characteristic
speech
miss
hugonin
leaned
back
and
sat
up
very
rigidly
and
smiled
at
him
like
a
cherub
kennaston
groaned
it
shall
be
as
you
will
he
assured
her
with
a
little
quaver
in
his
speech
that
was
decidedly
effective
and
in
any
event
i
am
not
sorry
that
i
have
loved
you
beautiful
child
you
have
always
been
a
power
for
good
in
my
life
you
have
gladdened
me
with
the
vision
of
a
beauty
that
is
more
than
human
you
have
heartened
me
for
this
petty
business
of
living
you
have
praised
my
verses
you
have
even
accorded
me
certain
pecuniary
assistance
as
to
their
publication
though
i
must
admit
that
to
accept
it
of
you
was
very
distasteful
to
me
ah
felix
kennaston
cried
with
a
quick
lift
of
speech
impractical
child
that
i
am
i
had
not
thought
of
that
my
love
had
caused
me
to
forget
the
great
barrier
that
stands
between
us
he
gasped
and
took
a
short
turn
about
the
court
pardon
me
miss
hugonin
he
entreated
when
his
emotions
were
under
a
little
better
control
for
having
spoken
as
i
did
i
had
forgotten
think
of
me
if
you
will
as
no
better
than
the
others
think
of
me
as
a
mere
my
presumption
will
be
justly
punished
oh
no
no
it
is
that
she
cried
it
is
that
is
it
you
you
would
care
just
as
much
about
me
if
i
were
poor
you
beautiful
i
do
want
you
to
care
for
me
of
course
margaret
added
with
haste
i
want
to
go
on
being
friends
oh
that
money
that
money
she
cried
in
a
sudden
gust
of
petulance
it
makes
me
so
distrustful
and
i
ca
help
it
he
smiled
at
her
wistfully
my
dear
said
he
are
there
no
mirrors
at
selwoode
to
remove
your
doubts
i
yes
i
do
believe
in
you
she
said
at
length
but
i
do
want
to
marry
you
you
see
i
not
a
bit
in
love
with
you
margaret
explained
candidly
ensued
a
silence
kennaston
bowed
his
head
you
bid
me
go
said
he
no
not
exactly
said
she
he
indicated
a
movement
toward
her
now
you
need
attempt
to
take
any
liberties
with
me
miss
hugonin
announced
decisively
because
if
you
do
i
never
speak
to
you
again
you
must
let
me
go
now
you
you
must
let
me
think
then
felix
kennaston
acted
very
wisely
he
rose
and
stood
aside
with
a
little
bow
i
can
wait
child
he
said
sadly
i
have
already
waited
a
long
time
miss
hugonin
escaped
into
the
house
without
further
delay
it
was
very
flattering
of
course
he
had
spoken
beautifully
she
thought
and
nobly
and
poetically
and
considerately
and
altogether
there
was
absolutely
no
excuse
for
her
being
in
a
temper
still
she
was
the
moon
however
considered
the
affair
as
arranged
for
she
had
been
no
whit
more
resolute
in
her
refusal
you
see
than
becomes
any
maid
in
fact
she
had
not
refused
him
and
the
experienced
moon
had
seen
the
hopes
of
many
a
wooer
thrive
on
answers
far
less
encouraging
than
that
which
margaret
had
given
felix
kennaston
margaret
was
very
fond
of
him
all
women
like
a
man
who
can
do
a
picturesque
thing
without
bothering
to
consider
whether
or
not
he
be
making
himself
ridiculous
and
more
than
once
in
thinking
of
him
she
had
wondered
if
perhaps
possibly
some
day
and
always
these
vague
flights
of
fancy
had
ended
at
this
precise
point
incinerated
if
you
will
grant
me
the
simile
by
the
sudden
flaming
of
her
cheeks
the
thing
is
common
enough
you
may
remember
that
romeo
was
not
the
only
gentleman
that
juliet
noticed
at
her
début
there
was
the
young
petruchio
and
the
son
and
heir
of
old
tiberio
and
i
do
not
question
that
she
had
a
kind
glance
or
so
for
county
paris
beyond
doubt
there
were
many
with
whom
my
lady
had
danced
with
whom
she
had
laughed
a
little
with
whom
she
had
exchanged
a
few
perfectly
affable
words
and
looks
when
of
a
sudden
her
heart
speaks
who
he
that
would
not
dance
if
he
be
married
my
grave
is
like
to
prove
my
in
any
event
paris
and
petruchio
and
tiberio
young
hopeful
can
go
hang
romeo
has
come
romeo
is
seldom
the
first
pray
you
what
was
there
to
prevent
juliet
from
admiring
dancing
or
from
observing
that
signor
had
remarkably
expressive
eyes
or
from
thinking
of
tybalt
as
a
dear
reckless
fellow
whom
it
was
the
duty
of
some
good
woman
to
rescue
from
perdition
if
no
one
blames
the
young
montague
for
sending
rosaline
to
the
rosaline
for
whom
he
was
weeping
and
rhyming
an
hour
before
why
pray
should
not
signorina
capulet
have
had
a
few
previous
du
depend
upon
it
she
had
for
was
she
not
already
past
thirteen
in
like
manner
i
dare
say
that
a
deal
passed
between
desdemona
and
cassio
that
the
honest
moor
never
knew
of
and
that
lucrece
was
probably
very
pleasant
and
agreeable
to
tarquin
as
a
hostess
should
be
and
that
helen
had
that
little
affair
with
theseus
before
she
ever
thought
of
paris
and
that
if
cleopatra
died
for
love
of
antony
it
was
not
until
she
had
previously
lived
a
great
while
with
cæsar
so
felix
kennaston
had
his
hour
now
margaret
has
gone
into
selwoode
and
quite
unconscious
that
she
is
humming
under
her
breath
the
words
of
a
certain
inane
old
song
oh
she
sat
for
me
a
chair
she
has
ringlets
in
her
hair
she
a
young
thing
and
can
not
leave
her
mother
only
she
sang
it
father
and
afterward
she
suddenly
frowned
and
stamped
her
foot
did
margaret
i
him
said
she
but
she
looked
very
guilty
x
in
the
of
selwoode
miss
hugonin
paused
undeniably
there
were
the
accounts
of
the
ladies
league
for
the
edification
of
the
impecunious
to
be
put
in
order
her
monthly
report
as
treasurer
was
due
in
a
few
days
and
margaret
was
in
such
matters
a
careful
painstaking
body
and
not
wholly
dependent
upon
her
secretary
but
she
was
entirely
too
much
out
of
temper
to
attend
to
that
now
it
was
really
all
kennaston
fault
she
assured
a
pricking
conscience
as
she
went
out
on
the
terrace
before
selwoode
he
had
bothered
her
dreadfully
there
she
found
petheridge
jukesbury
smoking
placidly
in
the
effulgence
of
the
moonlight
and
the
rotund
pasty
countenance
he
turned
toward
her
was
ludicrously
like
the
moon
counterfeit
in
muddy
water
i
am
sorry
to
admit
it
but
jukesbury
had
dined
somewhat
injudiciously
you
are
not
to
stretch
the
phrase
he
was
merely
prepared
to
accord
the
universe
his
approval
to
pat
destiny
upon
the
head
and
his
thoughts
ran
clear
enough
but
with
aprilian
of
the
jovial
and
the
lachrymose
ah
miss
hugonin
he
greeted
her
with
a
genial
smile
i
am
indeed
fortunate
you
find
me
deep
in
meditation
and
also
i
am
sorry
to
say
in
the
practise
of
a
most
pernicious
habit
you
do
not
object
ah
that
is
so
like
you
you
are
always
kind
miss
hugonin
your
kindness
which
falls
if
i
may
so
express
myself
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
upon
all
deserving
charitable
institutions
and
daily
comforts
the
destitute
with
good
advice
and
consoles
the
sorrowing
with
blankets
would
now
induce
you
to
tolerate
an
odour
which
i
am
sure
is
personally
distasteful
to
you
but
i
do
mind
was
margaret
protest
i
can
not
permit
it
jukesbury
insisted
and
waved
a
pudgy
hand
in
the
moonlight
no
really
i
can
not
permit
it
we
will
throw
it
away
if
you
please
and
say
no
more
about
it
and
his
glance
followed
the
glowing
flight
of
his
somewhat
wistfully
your
father
cigars
are
such
as
it
is
seldom
my
privilege
to
encounter
but
then
my
personal
habits
are
not
luxurious
nor
my
private
income
precisely
what
my
childish
imaginings
had
pictured
it
at
this
comparatively
advanced
period
of
life
ah
youth
youth
as
the
poet
admirably
says
miss
hugonin
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
but
its
visions
of
existence
are
and
free
from
care
and
its
conception
of
the
responsibilities
of
manhood
such
as
taxes
and
the
i
may
safely
characterise
as
extremely
sketchy
but
pray
be
seated
miss
hugonin
petheridge
jukesbury
blandly
urged
common
courtesy
forced
her
to
comply
so
margaret
seated
herself
on
a
little
red
rustic
bench
in
the
moonlight
but
i
think
i
have
mentioned
how
margaret
looked
in
the
moonlight
and
above
her
golden
head
the
eagle
sculptured
over
the
stretched
his
wings
to
the
uttermost
and
seemed
to
view
jukesbury
with
a
certain
air
of
expectation
a
beautiful
evening
petheridge
jukesbury
suggested
after
a
little
cogitation
she
conceded
that
this
was
undeniable
where
nature
smiles
and
only
the
conduct
of
man
is
vile
and
altogether
what
it
ought
not
to
be
he
continued
with
unction
ah
how
true
that
is
and
how
consoling
it
is
a
good
thing
to
meditate
upon
our
own
vileness
miss
hugonin
to
reflect
that
we
are
but
worms
with
naturally
the
most
vicious
inclinations
it
is
most
salutary
even
i
am
but
a
worm
miss
hugonin
though
the
press
has
been
pleased
to
speak
most
kindly
of
me
even
you
ah
no
cried
jukesbury
kissing
his
with
gallantry
let
us
say
a
worm
who
has
burst
its
cocoon
and
become
a
butterfly
a
butterfly
with
a
charming
face
and
a
most
charitable
disposition
and
considerable
property
margaret
thanked
him
with
a
smile
and
began
to
think
wistfully
of
the
ladies
league
accounts
still
he
was
a
good
man
and
she
endeavoured
to
persuade
herself
that
she
considered
his
goodness
to
atone
for
his
flabbiness
and
his
fleshiness
and
his
interminable
verbosity
which
she
did
jukesbury
sighed
a
naughty
world
said
he
with
pathos
a
very
naughty
world
which
really
does
not
deserve
the
honour
of
including
you
in
its
census
reports
yet
i
dare
say
it
has
the
effrontery
to
put
you
down
in
the
it
even
puts
me
down
me
an
humble
worker
in
the
vineyard
with
both
hands
set
to
the
plough
and
if
i
do
pay
up
it
sells
me
out
a
very
naughty
world
indeed
i
dare
say
jukesbury
observed
raising
his
eyes
not
toward
heaven
but
toward
the
eagle
that
its
conduct
as
the
poet
says
creates
considerable
distress
among
the
angels
i
do
know
i
am
not
acquainted
with
many
angels
my
wife
was
an
angel
but
she
is
now
a
lifeless
form
she
has
been
for
five
years
i
erected
a
tomb
to
her
at
considerable
personal
expense
but
i
do
begrudge
it
no
i
do
begrudge
it
miss
hugonin
she
was
very
hard
to
live
with
but
she
was
an
angel
and
angels
are
rare
miss
hugonin
said
petheridge
jukesbury
with
emphasis
are
an
angel
oh
dear
said
margaret
to
herself
i
do
wish
i
gone
to
bed
directly
after
dinner
above
them
the
eagle
brooded
surely
he
breathed
you
must
know
what
i
have
so
long
wanted
to
tell
you
no
said
margaret
and
i
do
want
to
know
please
you
make
me
awfully
tired
and
i
do
care
for
you
in
the
now
you
let
go
my
hand
let
go
at
once
he
detained
her
you
are
an
angel
he
insisted
an
angel
with
a
large
property
i
love
you
margaret
be
mine
be
my
blushing
bride
i
entreat
you
your
property
is
far
too
large
for
an
angel
to
look
after
you
need
a
man
of
affairs
i
am
a
man
of
affairs
i
am
and
have
no
bad
habits
my
are
as
a
rule
favourable
my
eloquence
is
accounted
considerable
and
my
dearest
aspiration
is
that
you
will
comfort
my
declining
years
i
might
add
that
i
adore
you
but
i
think
i
mentioned
that
before
margaret
will
you
be
my
blushing
bride
no
said
miss
hugonin
emphatically
no
you
tipsy
old
beast
no
there
was
a
rustle
of
skirts
the
door
slammed
and
the
philanthropist
was
left
alone
on
the
terrace
xi
in
the
margaret
came
upon
hugh
van
orden
who
was
searching
in
one
of
the
alcoves
for
a
piece
of
music
that
adèle
haggage
wanted
and
had
misplaced
the
boy
greeted
her
miserably
miss
hugonin
he
lamented
you
awfully
hard
on
me
i
am
sorry
said
margaret
that
you
consider
me
discourteous
to
a
guest
in
my
own
house
oh
i
grant
you
margaret
was
in
a
temper
now
it
is
that
he
protested
but
i
never
see
you
alone
and
had
something
to
tell
you
yes
said
she
coldly
he
drew
near
to
her
surely
he
breathed
you
must
know
what
i
have
long
wanted
to
tell
you
yes
i
should
think
i
said
margaret
and
if
you
dare
tell
me
a
word
of
it
i
never
speak
to
you
again
it
getting
a
little
monotonous
van
orden
half
way
up
the
stairs
she
paused
and
ran
lightly
back
oh
hugh
hugh
she
said
contritely
i
was
unpardonably
rude
sorry
dear
but
it
quite
impossible
you
are
a
dear
cute
little
boy
and
i
love
you
but
not
that
way
so
let
shake
hands
hugh
and
be
friends
and
then
you
can
go
and
play
with
adèle
he
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
he
really
was
a
nice
boy
but
oh
dear
said
margaret
when
he
had
gone
what
horrid
creatures
men
are
and
what
a
temper
i
in
and
what
a
vexatious
place
the
world
is
i
wish
i
were
a
pauper
i
wish
i
had
never
been
born
and
i
wish
and
i
wish
i
had
those
league
papers
fixed
do
it
i
sure
i
need
something
tranquillising
like
assessments
and
decimal
places
and
unpaid
dues
to
keep
me
from
i
hate
them
all
all
three
of
them
as
badly
as
i
do
thereupon
she
blushed
for
no
apparent
reason
and
went
to
her
own
rooms
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
was
inexcusable
but
very
becoming
her
cheeks
burned
her
eyes
flashed
with
a
brighter
glow
that
was
and
a
little
cruel
and
her
chin
tilted
up
defiantly
margaret
had
a
resolute
chin
a
masculine
chin
i
fancy
that
it
was
only
at
the
last
moment
that
nature
found
it
a
thought
too
boyish
and
modified
it
with
a
dimple
a
very
creditable
dimple
by
the
way
that
she
must
have
been
really
proud
of
that
ridiculous
little
dint
saved
it
feminised
it
altogether
then
she
swept
down
upon
the
papers
of
the
ladies
league
for
the
edification
of
the
impecunious
with
very
much
the
look
of
a
diminutive
valkyrie
a
valkyrie
of
unusual
personal
attractions
you
understand
for
the
and
a
little
a
very
little
eager
and
expectant
of
the
strife
subsequently
oh
dear
said
she
amid
a
feverish
rustling
of
papers
the
whole
world
is
out
of
sorts
i
never
know
how
much
seven
times
eight
is
and
i
hate
everybody
and
left
that
list
of
unpaid
dues
in
uncle
fred
room
and
i
got
to
go
after
it
and
i
do
want
to
bother
those
little
suitors
of
mine
miss
hugonin
rose
and
went
out
from
her
own
rooms
carrying
a
bunch
of
keys
across
the
hallway
to
the
room
in
which
frederick
woods
had
died
it
was
his
study
you
may
remember
it
had
been
little
used
since
his
death
but
margaret
kept
her
less
important
papers
there
the
overflow
the
flotsam
of
her
vast
philanthropic
and
educational
correspondence
and
there
she
found
billy
woods
xii
his
back
was
turned
to
the
door
as
she
entered
he
was
staring
at
a
picture
beside
the
mantel
a
portrait
of
frederick
woods
and
his
eyes
when
he
wheeled
about
were
wistful
then
on
a
sudden
they
lighted
up
as
if
they
had
caught
fire
from
hers
and
his
adoration
flaunted
crimson
banners
in
his
cheeks
and
his
heart
i
dare
say
was
a
great
blaze
of
happiness
he
loved
her
you
see
when
she
entered
a
room
it
really
made
a
difference
to
this
absurd
young
man
he
saw
a
great
many
lights
for
instance
and
heard
music
and
accordingly
he
laughed
now
in
a
very
contented
fashion
i
was
burglarising
said
he
that
is
not
exactly
i
ought
to
have
asked
your
permission
i
suppose
before
coming
here
but
i
could
find
you
and
and
it
was
rather
important
you
see
woods
continued
pointing
to
the
great
carved
desk
i
happened
to
speak
of
this
desk
to
the
colonel
we
we
were
talking
of
uncle
fred
death
and
i
found
out
quite
by
accident
that
it
been
searched
since
then
that
is
not
thoroughly
there
are
secret
drawers
you
see
one
here
and
he
touched
the
spring
that
threw
it
open
and
the
other
on
this
side
there
is
there
is
nothing
of
importance
in
them
only
receipted
bills
and
such
the
other
drawer
is
inside
that
centre
compartment
which
is
locked
the
colonel
come
he
said
it
was
all
foolishness
and
that
he
had
a
book
he
wanted
to
read
so
he
sent
me
after
what
he
called
my
mare
nest
it
is
you
see
no
not
quite
not
quite
woods
murmured
with
an
odd
smile
and
then
laughed
and
added
lamely
i
i
suppose
i
the
only
person
who
knew
about
it
woods
manner
was
a
thought
strange
he
stammered
a
little
in
speaking
he
laughed
unnecessarily
and
margaret
could
see
that
his
hands
trembled
taking
him
all
in
all
you
would
have
sworn
he
was
repressing
some
vital
emotion
but
he
did
not
seem
unhappy
no
not
exactly
unhappy
he
was
with
margaret
you
see
oh
you
beauty
his
meditations
ran
he
had
some
excuse
in
the
soft
rosy
twilight
of
the
room
the
study
at
selwoode
is
panelled
in
very
dark
oak
and
the
doors
and
windows
are
screened
with
crimson
hangings
her
gown
might
have
been
a
scrap
of
afterglow
left
over
from
an
unusually
fine
sunset
in
a
word
miss
hugonin
was
a
very
quaint
and
colourful
and
delectable
figure
as
she
came
a
little
further
into
the
room
her
eyes
shone
like
blue
stars
and
her
hair
shone
there
must
be
pounds
of
it
billy
thought
and
her
very
shoulders
plump
flawless
ineffable
shone
with
the
glow
of
an
errant
that
is
just
past
the
track
of
dawn
and
is
therefore
neither
pink
nor
white
but
manages
somehow
to
combine
the
best
points
of
both
colours
ah
indeed
said
miss
hugonin
her
tone
imparted
a
surprising
degree
of
chilliness
to
this
simple
remark
no
she
went
on
very
formally
this
is
not
a
private
room
you
owe
me
no
apology
for
being
here
indeed
i
am
rather
obliged
to
you
woods
for
none
of
us
knew
of
these
secret
drawers
here
is
the
key
to
the
central
compartment
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
point
out
the
other
one
dear
dear
margaret
concluded
languidly
all
this
is
quite
like
a
melodrama
i
have
the
least
doubt
you
will
discover
a
will
in
there
in
your
favour
and
be
reinstated
as
the
heir
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
how
tiresome
that
will
be
for
me
though
she
was
in
a
mood
to
be
cruel
she
held
out
the
keys
to
him
in
a
disinterested
fashion
and
dropped
them
daintily
into
his
outstretched
palm
just
as
she
might
have
given
a
coin
to
an
unusually
grimy
mendicant
but
the
tips
of
her
fingers
grazed
his
hand
that
did
the
mischief
her
least
touch
was
enough
to
set
every
nerve
in
his
body
peggy
he
said
hoarsely
as
the
keys
jangled
to
the
floor
then
woods
drew
a
little
nearer
to
her
and
said
peggy
peggy
in
a
voice
that
trembled
curiously
and
appeared
to
have
no
intention
of
saying
anything
further
indeed
words
would
have
seemed
mere
tautology
to
any
one
who
could
have
seen
his
eyes
margaret
looked
into
them
for
a
minute
and
her
own
eyes
fell
before
their
blaze
and
her
heart
very
foolishly
stood
still
for
a
subsequently
she
recalled
the
fact
that
he
was
a
and
that
she
despised
him
and
also
observed
to
her
surprise
and
indignation
that
he
was
holding
her
hand
and
had
apparently
been
doing
so
for
some
time
you
may
believe
it
that
she
withdrew
that
trifle
angrily
enough
pray
do
be
absurd
woods
said
she
billy
caught
up
the
word
absurd
he
echoed
yes
that
describes
what
i
been
pretty
well
does
it
peggy
i
absurd
when
i
let
you
send
me
to
the
four
years
ago
i
realised
that
the
moment
i
saw
you
i
should
have
held
on
like
the
very
grimmest
death
i
should
have
bullied
you
into
marrying
me
if
necessary
and
in
spite
of
fifty
anstruthers
oh
yes
i
know
that
now
but
i
was
only
a
boy
then
peggy
and
so
i
let
a
boy
pride
come
between
us
i
know
now
there
is
any
question
of
pride
where
you
are
concerned
not
any
question
of
pride
nor
of
any
silly
misunderstandings
nor
of
any
uncle
wishes
nor
of
anything
but
just
you
peggy
it
just
you
that
i
care
for
now
just
you
ah
margaret
cried
with
a
swift
intake
of
the
breath
that
was
almost
a
sob
he
had
dared
after
all
oh
it
was
shameless
sordid
and
yet
she
thought
dimly
how
dear
that
little
quiver
in
his
voice
had
been
were
it
unplanned
and
how
she
could
have
loved
this
big
eager
boy
were
he
not
the
hypocrite
she
knew
him
show
him
but
somehow
though
it
was
manifestly
what
he
deserved
she
found
she
could
look
him
in
the
face
while
she
did
it
so
she
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
floor
and
waited
for
a
moment
of
tense
silence
then
am
i
to
consider
this
a
proposal
mr
woods
she
asked
in
muffled
tones
billy
stared
yes
said
he
very
gravely
after
an
interval
you
see
she
explained
still
in
the
same
dull
voice
you
phrased
it
so
vaguely
i
could
well
be
certain
you
do
propose
very
well
woods
i
i
had
opportunities
to
become
an
authority
on
such
matters
you
see
since
i
been
rich
that
makes
a
difference
does
it
a
great
many
men
are
willing
to
marry
me
now
who
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
say
say
four
years
ago
so
i
had
some
experience
oh
yes
three
three
have
offered
to
marry
me
for
my
money
earlier
in
this
very
evening
before
you
did
woods
and
really
i
ca
compliment
you
on
your
methods
woods
they
are
a
little
vague
a
little
abrupt
a
little
transparent
you
think
peggy
he
cried
in
a
frightened
whisper
he
could
not
believe
you
see
that
it
was
the
woman
he
loved
who
was
speaking
and
for
my
part
i
admit
frankly
that
at
this
very
point
if
ever
in
her
life
margaret
deserved
a
thorough
shaking
dear
me
she
airily
observed
i
sure
i
said
nothing
out
of
the
way
i
think
it
speaks
very
well
for
you
that
you
so
fond
of
your
old
home
so
anxious
to
regain
it
at
cost
it
quite
touching
mr
woods
she
raised
her
eyes
toward
his
i
dare
say
she
was
suffering
as
much
as
he
but
women
consider
it
a
point
of
honour
to
smile
when
they
stab
margaret
smiled
with
an
innocence
that
would
have
seemed
overdone
in
an
angel
then
in
an
instant
she
had
the
grace
to
be
abjectly
ashamed
of
herself
billy
face
had
gone
white
his
mouth
was
set
and
his
breathing
was
a
little
perfunctory
it
stung
her
though
that
he
was
not
angry
he
was
sorry
i
i
see
he
said
very
carefully
you
think
i
want
the
money
yes
i
see
and
why
not
she
queried
pleasantly
dear
me
money
a
very
sensible
thing
to
want
i
sure
it
makes
a
great
difference
you
know
he
looked
down
into
her
face
for
a
moment
one
might
have
sworn
this
detected
pitied
her
yes
he
assented
slowly
it
makes
a
difference
not
a
difference
for
the
better
i
afraid
peggy
ensued
a
silence
then
margaret
tossed
her
head
she
was
fast
losing
her
composure
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
retract
what
she
had
said
and
accordingly
she
resolved
to
brazen
it
out
you
need
look
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
convicted
criminal
she
said
sharply
i
wo
marry
you
and
there
an
end
of
it
it
is
that
i
thinking
of
said
woods
with
a
grave
smile
you
see
it
takes
me
a
little
time
to
realise
your
honest
opinion
of
me
i
believe
i
understand
now
you
think
me
a
very
hopeless
cad
that
about
your
real
opinion
is
it
peggy
i
did
know
that
you
see
i
thought
you
knew
me
better
than
that
you
did
once
peggy
once
a
long
time
ago
and
and
i
hoped
you
had
quite
forgotten
that
time
the
allusion
was
ill
chosen
oh
oh
she
cried
gasping
to
remind
me
of
that
time
you
of
all
men
have
you
a
vestige
of
shame
have
you
a
rag
of
honour
left
oh
i
did
know
there
were
such
men
in
the
world
and
to
think
to
think
margaret
glorious
voice
broke
and
she
wrung
her
hands
helplessly
then
after
a
little
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
spoke
without
a
trace
of
emotion
to
think
she
said
and
her
voice
was
toneless
now
to
think
that
i
loved
you
it
that
that
hurts
you
know
for
i
loved
you
very
dearly
billy
woods
yes
i
think
i
loved
you
quite
as
much
as
any
woman
can
ever
love
a
man
you
were
the
first
you
see
and
girls
girls
are
very
foolish
about
such
things
i
thought
you
were
brave
and
strong
and
clean
and
honest
and
beautiful
and
dear
oh
quite
the
best
and
dearest
man
in
the
world
i
thought
you
billy
woods
that
that
was
queer
was
it
she
asked
with
a
listless
little
shiver
yes
it
was
very
queer
you
did
think
of
me
in
quite
that
way
did
you
no
you
you
thought
i
was
well
enough
to
amuse
you
for
a
while
i
was
well
enough
for
a
summer
flirtation
was
i
billy
but
marriage
ah
no
you
never
thought
of
marriage
then
you
ran
away
when
uncle
fred
suggested
that
you
refused
refused
in
this
very
room
did
you
billy
ah
that
that
hurt
margaret
ended
with
a
faint
smile
yes
it
hurt
billy
woods
raised
a
protesting
hand
as
though
to
speak
but
afterward
he
drew
a
deep
tremulous
breath
and
bit
his
lip
and
was
silent
she
had
spoken
very
quietly
very
simply
very
like
a
tired
child
now
her
voice
lifted
but
you
hurt
me
more
she
said
equably
when
you
come
cringing
back
to
me
to
me
whom
you
have
none
of
when
i
was
poor
i
rich
now
though
that
makes
a
difference
does
it
billy
you
willing
to
whistle
back
the
girl
love
you
flung
away
once
yes
quite
willing
but
ca
you
understand
how
much
it
must
hurt
me
to
think
i
ever
loved
you
margaret
asked
very
gently
she
wanted
him
to
understand
she
wanted
him
to
be
ashamed
she
prayed
god
that
he
might
be
just
a
little
little
bit
ashamed
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
forgive
him
but
he
stood
silent
bending
puzzled
brows
toward
her
ca
you
understand
billy
she
pleaded
softly
i
ca
help
seeing
what
a
cur
you
are
i
must
hate
you
billy
of
course
i
must
she
insisted
very
gently
as
though
arguing
the
matter
with
herself
then
suddenly
she
sobbed
and
wrung
her
hands
in
anguish
oh
i
ca
i
ca
she
wailed
god
help
me
i
ca
hate
you
even
though
i
know
you
for
what
you
are
his
arms
lifted
a
little
and
in
a
flash
margaret
knew
that
what
she
most
wanted
in
all
the
world
was
to
have
them
close
about
her
and
then
to
lay
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
cry
contentedly
oh
she
did
want
to
forgive
him
if
he
had
lost
all
sense
of
shame
why
could
he
not
lie
to
her
surely
he
could
at
least
lie
and
oh
how
gladly
she
would
believe
only
the
tiniest
the
flimsiest
fiction
her
eyes
craved
of
him
but
he
merely
said
i
see
i
see
very
slowly
and
then
smiled
we
put
the
money
aside
just
now
he
said
perhaps
after
a
little
we
we
came
back
to
that
i
think
you
forgotten
though
that
when
when
uncle
fred
and
i
had
our
difference
you
had
just
thrown
me
over
had
just
ordered
me
never
to
speak
to
you
again
i
could
very
well
ask
you
to
marry
me
could
i
under
those
circumstances
i
spoke
in
a
moment
of
irritation
a
very
dignified
margaret
pointed
out
you
would
have
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
it
if
you
had
really
cared
billy
laughed
rather
sadly
oh
i
cared
right
enough
he
said
i
still
care
the
question
is
do
you
no
said
margaret
with
decision
i
do
not
in
the
peggy
woods
commanded
look
at
me
you
have
had
your
answer
i
think
miss
hugonin
indifferently
observed
billy
caught
her
chin
in
his
hand
and
turned
her
face
to
his
peggy
do
you
care
he
asked
softly
and
margaret
looked
into
his
eyes
and
in
a
panic
knew
that
her
traitor
lips
were
forming
yes
that
would
be
rather
unfortunate
would
it
she
asked
with
a
smile
you
see
it
was
only
an
hour
ago
i
promised
to
marry
mr
kennaston
kennaston
billy
gasped
you
you
do
mean
that
you
care
for
peggy
i
really
ca
see
why
it
should
concern
you
said
margaret
sweetly
but
since
you
ask
i
do
you
could
expect
me
to
remain
inconsolable
forever
you
know
then
the
room
blurred
before
her
eyes
she
stood
rigid
defiant
she
was
dimly
aware
that
billy
was
speaking
speaking
from
a
great
distance
it
seemed
and
then
after
a
century
or
two
his
face
came
back
to
her
out
of
the
whirl
of
things
and
though
she
did
not
know
it
they
were
smiling
bravely
at
one
and
so
woods
was
stating
i
been
an
even
greater
ass
than
usual
and
i
hope
you
be
very
very
happy
illustration
billy
unfolded
it
slowly
with
a
puzzled
look
growing
in
his
countenance
thank
you
she
returned
mechanically
i
i
hope
so
after
an
interval
peggy
said
woods
oh
said
she
with
a
start
he
turned
to
go
then
by
jove
said
he
grimly
i
been
so
busy
making
an
ass
of
myself
i
forgotten
all
about
more
more
important
things
woods
picked
up
the
keys
and
going
to
the
desk
unlocked
the
centre
compartment
with
a
jerk
afterward
he
gave
a
sharp
exclamation
he
had
found
a
paper
in
the
secret
drawer
at
the
back
which
appeared
to
startle
him
billy
unfolded
it
slowly
with
a
puzzled
look
growing
in
his
countenance
then
for
a
moment
margaret
golden
head
drew
close
to
his
yellow
curls
and
they
read
it
through
together
and
in
the
most
melodramatic
and
improbable
fashion
in
the
world
they
found
it
to
be
the
last
will
and
testament
of
frederick
woods
but
but
i
do
understand
was
miss
hugonin
awed
comment
exactly
like
the
other
will
only
why
it
dated
the
seventeenth
of
june
the
day
before
he
died
and
it
witnessed
by
hodges
and
burton
the
butler
and
the
first
footman
you
know
and
they
never
said
anything
about
such
a
paper
and
then
why
should
he
have
made
another
will
just
like
the
first
billy
pondered
by
and
bye
i
think
i
can
explain
that
he
said
in
a
rather
peculiar
voice
you
see
hodges
and
burton
witnessed
all
his
papers
half
the
time
without
knowing
what
they
were
about
they
would
hardly
have
thought
of
this
particular
one
after
his
death
and
it
quite
the
same
will
as
the
other
it
leaves
you
practically
everything
but
it
does
appoint
any
trustees
as
the
other
did
because
this
will
was
drawn
up
after
you
were
of
age
moreover
it
contains
these
four
bequests
to
colleges
to
establish
a
woods
chair
of
ethnology
which
the
other
will
did
provide
for
of
course
it
would
have
been
simpler
merely
to
add
a
codicil
to
the
first
will
but
uncle
fred
was
always
very
methodical
i
i
think
he
was
probably
going
through
the
desk
the
night
he
died
destroying
various
papers
he
must
have
taken
the
other
will
out
to
destroy
it
just
just
before
he
died
perhaps
perhaps
billy
paused
for
a
little
and
then
laughed
unmirthfully
it
scarcely
matters
said
he
here
is
the
will
it
is
undoubtedly
genuine
and
undoubtedly
the
last
he
made
you
have
to
have
it
probated
peggy
and
settle
with
the
colleges
it
it
wo
make
much
of
a
hole
in
the
woods
millions
there
was
a
bitterness
in
his
voice
that
margaret
noted
silently
so
she
thought
he
had
hoped
for
a
moment
that
at
the
last
frederick
woods
had
relented
toward
him
it
grieved
her
in
a
dull
fashion
to
see
him
so
mercenary
it
grieved
her
though
she
would
have
denied
it
emphatically
to
see
him
so
disappointed
since
he
wanted
the
money
so
much
she
would
have
liked
for
him
to
have
had
it
worthless
as
he
was
for
the
sake
of
the
boy
he
had
been
thank
you
she
said
coldly
as
she
took
the
paper
i
will
give
it
to
my
father
he
will
do
what
is
necessary
mr
woods
then
she
locked
up
the
desk
in
a
businesslike
fashion
and
turned
to
him
and
held
out
her
hand
billy
said
this
perfectly
inconsistent
young
woman
for
a
moment
i
thought
uncle
fred
had
altered
his
will
in
your
favour
i
almost
wish
he
had
billy
smiled
a
little
that
would
never
have
done
he
said
gravely
as
he
shook
hands
you
forget
what
a
sordid
and
heartless
and
generally
chap
i
am
peggy
it
much
better
as
it
is
only
the
tiniest
the
flimsiest
fiction
her
eyes
craved
of
him
even
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
lie
to
me
billy
woods
and
oh
how
gladly
i
will
believe
but
he
merely
said
peggy
and
went
out
of
the
room
his
broad
shoulders
had
a
pathetic
droop
a
listlessness
margaret
was
glad
of
course
she
was
glad
at
last
she
had
told
him
exactly
what
she
thought
of
him
why
should
she
be
glad
she
was
delighted
so
by
way
of
expressing
this
delight
she
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
began
to
cry
very
softly
xiii
having
duly
considered
the
emptiness
of
existence
the
unworthiness
of
men
the
dreary
future
that
awaited
her
though
this
did
not
trouble
her
greatly
as
she
confidently
expected
to
die
soon
and
many
other
such
dolorous
topics
miss
hugonin
decided
to
retire
for
the
night
she
rose
filled
with
speculations
as
to
the
paltriness
of
life
and
the
probability
of
her
eyes
being
red
in
the
morning
it
will
be
all
his
fault
if
they
are
she
consoled
herself
doubtless
he
be
very
much
pleased
after
robbing
me
of
all
faith
in
humanity
i
dare
say
the
one
thing
needed
to
complete
his
happiness
is
to
make
me
look
like
a
fright
i
hate
him
after
making
me
miserable
now
i
suppose
he
go
off
and
make
some
other
woman
miserable
oh
of
course
he
make
love
to
the
first
woman
he
meets
who
has
any
money
i
sure
she
welcome
to
him
i
only
pity
any
woman
who
has
to
put
up
with
no
i
do
margaret
decided
after
reflection
i
hate
her
too
miss
hugonin
went
to
the
door
leading
to
the
hallway
and
paused
then
i
grieve
to
relate
it
she
shook
a
little
fist
in
the
air
i
detest
you
she
commented
between
her
teeth
oh
how
you
make
me
feel
so
ashamed
of
the
way
i
treated
you
the
query
as
possibly
you
may
have
divined
was
addressed
to
woods
he
was
standing
by
the
fireplace
in
the
hallway
and
his
tall
figure
was
outlined
sharply
against
the
flame
of
the
that
burned
there
his
shoulders
had
a
pathetic
droop
a
listlessness
billy
was
reading
a
paper
of
some
kind
by
the
firelight
and
the
black
outline
of
his
face
smiled
grimly
over
it
then
he
laughed
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
billy
a
voice
observed
a
voice
that
was
honey
and
gold
and
velvet
and
all
that
is
most
sweet
and
rich
and
soft
in
the
world
woods
was
aware
of
a
light
step
a
swishing
sibilant
delightful
rustling
the
caress
of
sound
is
the
rustling
of
a
woman
skirts
and
of
an
afterthought
of
violets
of
a
mere
reminiscence
of
orris
all
of
which
came
toward
him
through
the
dimness
of
the
hall
he
started
noticeably
billy
miss
hugonin
stated
i
sorry
for
what
i
said
to
you
not
sure
it
is
true
you
know
but
i
sorry
i
said
it
bless
your
heart
said
billy
do
you
worry
over
that
peggy
that
all
right
incidentally
the
things
you
said
to
me
and
about
me
are
true
of
course
but
we
wo
discuss
that
just
now
i
i
fancy
we
both
feeling
a
bit
fagged
go
to
bed
peggy
we
both
go
to
bed
and
the
night
will
bring
counsel
and
we
sleep
off
all
unkindliness
go
to
bed
little
sister
get
all
the
you
are
in
the
least
in
need
of
and
dream
of
how
happy
you
going
to
be
with
the
man
you
love
and
and
in
the
morning
i
may
have
something
to
say
to
you
dear
and
this
time
he
really
went
and
when
he
had
come
to
the
bend
in
the
stairs
his
eyes
turned
back
to
hers
slowly
and
irresistibly
drawn
toward
them
as
it
seemed
just
as
the
sunflower
is
drawn
toward
the
sun
or
the
needle
toward
the
pole
or
in
fine
as
the
eyes
of
young
gentlemen
ordinarily
are
drawn
toward
the
eyes
of
the
one
woman
in
the
world
then
he
disappeared
the
mummery
of
it
vexed
margaret
there
was
no
excuse
for
his
looking
at
her
in
that
way
it
irritated
her
she
was
almost
as
angry
with
him
for
doing
it
as
she
would
have
been
for
not
doing
it
therefore
she
bent
an
angry
face
toward
the
fire
her
mouth
pouting
in
a
rather
inviting
fashion
then
it
rounded
slowly
into
a
sanguine
o
which
of
itself
suggested
osculation
but
in
reality
stood
for
observe
for
the
paper
billy
had
thrown
into
the
fire
had
fallen
under
the
and
she
remembered
his
guilty
start
after
all
said
margaret
it
none
of
my
business
so
she
eyed
it
wistfully
it
may
be
important
she
considerately
remembered
it
ought
not
to
be
left
there
so
she
fished
it
out
with
a
big
but
it
ca
be
very
important
she
dissented
afterward
or
he
would
have
thrown
it
away
so
she
looked
at
the
superscripture
on
the
back
of
it
then
she
gave
a
little
gasp
and
tore
it
open
and
read
it
by
the
firelight
miss
hugonin
subsequently
took
credit
to
herself
for
not
going
into
hysterics
and
i
think
she
had
some
reason
to
for
she
found
the
paper
a
duplicate
of
the
one
billy
had
taken
out
of
the
secret
drawer
with
his
name
set
in
the
place
of
hers
at
the
last
frederick
woods
had
relented
toward
his
nephew
margaret
laughed
a
little
then
she
cried
a
little
then
she
did
both
together
afterward
she
sat
in
the
firelight
very
puzzled
and
very
excited
and
very
penitent
and
very
beautiful
and
was
happier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
he
had
it
in
his
pocket
her
dear
voice
quavered
he
had
it
in
his
pocket
my
brave
strong
beautiful
billy
did
when
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
it
was
king
cophetua
wooing
the
and
the
beggar
was
an
impudent
ungrateful
idiotic
little
margaret
hissed
in
her
most
shrewish
manner
she
ought
to
be
spanked
she
ought
to
go
down
on
her
knees
to
him
in
sackcloth
and
tears
and
ashes
and
all
sorts
of
penitential
things
she
will
too
oh
it
such
a
beautiful
world
a
beautiful
world
billy
loves
me
really
billy
a
millionaire
and
i
a
pauper
oh
i
glad
glad
she
caressed
the
paper
that
had
rendered
the
world
such
a
goodly
place
to
live
in
caressed
it
tenderly
and
rubbed
her
check
against
it
that
was
margaret
way
of
showing
affection
you
know
and
i
protest
it
must
have
been
very
pleasant
for
the
paper
the
only
wonder
was
that
the
ink
it
was
written
in
did
turn
red
with
delight
then
she
read
it
through
again
for
sheer
enjoyment
of
those
beautiful
incomprehensible
words
that
disinherited
her
how
of
uncle
fred
she
thought
of
course
he
forgiven
billy
who
would
what
beautiful
language
uncle
fred
used
quite
she
termed
it
then
she
gasped
the
will
in
billy
favour
was
dated
a
week
earlier
than
the
one
they
had
found
in
the
secret
drawer
it
was
worthless
mere
waste
paper
at
the
last
frederick
woods
pride
had
conquered
his
love
oh
the
horrid
old
man
margaret
wailed
he
left
me
everything
he
had
how
he
disinherit
billy
i
call
it
rank
impertinence
in
him
oh
boy
dear
dear
boy
miss
hugonin
crooned
in
an
ecstacy
of
tenderness
and
woe
he
found
this
first
will
in
one
of
the
other
drawers
and
thought
was
the
rich
one
and
came
in
a
great
whirl
of
joy
to
ask
me
to
marry
him
and
i
was
horrid
to
him
oh
what
a
mess
i
made
of
it
i
called
him
a
and
told
him
i
love
another
man
and
he
never
never
ask
me
to
marry
him
now
and
i
love
him
i
worship
him
i
adore
him
and
if
only
i
were
poor
ensued
a
silence
margaret
lifted
the
two
wills
scrutinised
them
closely
and
then
looked
at
the
fire
interrogatively
it
penal
servitude
for
quite
a
number
of
years
she
said
but
then
he
really
tell
any
one
you
know
no
gentleman
would
allow
a
lady
to
be
locked
up
in
jail
and
if
he
knew
if
he
knew
i
did
and
could
consider
him
a
i
really
believe
he
would
whatever
she
believed
he
would
do
the
probability
of
his
doing
it
seemed
highly
agreeable
to
miss
hugonin
she
smiled
at
the
fire
in
the
most
friendly
fashion
and
held
out
one
of
the
folded
papers
to
it
yes
said
margaret
i
quite
sure
he
will
there
i
think
we
may
leave
her
for
i
have
dredged
the
dictionary
and
i
confess
i
have
found
no
fitting
words
wherewith
to
picture
this
inconsistent
impulsive
adorable
young
woman
dreaming
brave
dreams
in
the
firelight
of
her
lover
and
of
their
united
future
i
should
only
bungle
it
you
must
imagine
it
for
yourself
it
is
a
pretty
picture
is
it
not
with
its
laughable
side
perhaps
under
the
circumstances
whimsical
if
you
will
but
very
very
sacred
for
she
loved
him
with
a
clean
heart
loved
him
infinitely
let
us
smile
at
it
tenderly
and
pass
on
but
upon
my
word
when
i
think
of
how
unreasonably
how
outrageously
margaret
had
behaved
during
the
entire
evening
i
am
tempted
to
depose
her
as
our
heroine
i
begin
to
regret
i
had
not
selected
adèle
haggage
she
would
have
done
admirably
for
depend
upon
it
she
too
had
her
trepidations
her
white
nights
her
occult
battles
over
hugh
van
orden
also
she
was
a
pretty
girl
if
you
care
for
brunettes
and
accomplished
she
was
versed
in
i
forget
how
many
foreign
languages
both
continental
and
dead
and
could
discourse
sensibly
in
any
one
of
them
she
was
perfectly
reasonable
perfectly
consistent
perfectly
unimpulsive
and
never
expressed
an
opinion
that
was
not
countenanced
by
at
least
two
competent
authorities
i
do
know
a
man
living
prepared
to
dispute
that
miss
haggage
excelled
miss
hugonin
in
all
these
desirable
qualities
yet
with
pleasing
unanimity
they
went
mad
for
margaret
and
had
the
greatest
possible
respect
for
adèle
and
my
dear
grundy
i
grant
you
cheerfully
that
this
was
all
wrong
a
sensible
man
as
you
very
justly
observe
will
seek
in
a
woman
something
more
enduring
than
mere
personal
attractions
he
will
value
her
for
some
sensible
reason
say
for
her
wit
or
her
learning
or
her
skill
in
cookery
or
her
proficiency
in
greek
a
sensible
man
will
look
for
a
sensible
woman
he
will
not
concern
his
sensible
head
over
such
trumperies
as
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
or
a
red
lip
or
so
or
a
satisfactory
suit
of
hair
these
are
fleeting
vanities
however
you
have
doubtless
heard
ere
this
my
dear
madam
that
had
nose
been
an
inch
shorter
the
destiny
of
the
world
would
have
been
changed
had
she
been
the
woman
you
describe
perfectly
reasonable
perfectly
consistent
perfectly
sensible
in
all
she
said
and
did
confess
dear
lady
would
antony
have
taken
to
his
heels
and
have
fled
from
such
a
monster
xiv
i
regret
to
admit
that
woods
did
not
toss
feverishly
about
his
bed
all
through
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
he
was
very
miserable
but
he
was
also
that
is
an
age
when
the
blind
deals
no
fatal
wounds
it
is
an
age
to
suffer
poignantly
if
you
will
an
age
wherein
to
aspire
to
the
dearest
woman
on
earth
to
write
her
halting
verses
to
lose
her
to
affect
the
of
cynicism
to
hear
the
chimes
at
midnight
and
after
it
all
to
sleep
like
a
top
so
billy
slept
and
kind
hypnos
loosed
a
dream
through
the
gates
of
ivory
that
lifted
him
to
a
delectable
land
where
peggy
was
nineteen
and
had
never
heard
of
kennaston
and
was
unbelievably
sweet
and
dear
and
beautiful
but
presently
they
and
the
colonel
put
forth
to
sea
on
a
great
carved
fishing
for
sharks
which
the
colonel
said
were
very
plentiful
in
those
waters
and
frederick
woods
climbed
up
out
of
the
sea
and
said
billy
was
a
fool
and
must
go
to
college
and
peggy
said
that
was
impossible
as
seventeen
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
children
had
to
be
given
an
education
apiece
and
they
could
spare
one
for
billy
and
a
missionary
from
zambesi
land
came
out
of
one
of
the
secret
drawers
and
said
billy
must
give
him
both
of
his
feet
as
he
needed
them
for
his
classes
and
thereupon
the
sharks
poked
their
heads
out
of
the
water
and
began
in
a
deafening
chorus
to
cry
feet
feet
feet
and
billy
then
woke
with
a
start
and
found
it
was
only
the
birds
chattering
in
the
dawn
outside
then
he
was
miserable
he
tossed
and
groaned
and
dozed
and
smoked
cigarettes
until
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
got
up
and
dressed
in
sheer
desperation
and
went
for
a
walk
in
the
gardens
the
day
was
clear
as
a
coin
it
was
not
yet
wholly
aired
not
wholly
free
from
the
damp
savour
of
night
but
low
in
the
east
the
sun
was
taking
heart
a
shadow
footed
it
with
billy
woods
in
his
pacings
through
the
gardens
he
surprised
the
world
at
its
toilet
and
its
fleeting
grace
somewhat
fortified
his
spirits
but
his
thoughts
pestered
him
like
gnats
the
things
he
said
to
the
roses
it
is
not
necessary
to
set
down
xv
after
a
vituperative
or
so
woods
was
hungry
he
came
back
toward
selwoode
and
upon
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
house
he
found
kathleen
saumarez
during
the
warm
weather
one
corner
of
the
terrace
had
been
converted
by
means
of
gay
awnings
into
a
sort
of
there
were
chairs
tables
bowls
of
roses
and
any
number
of
rugs
altogether
it
was
a
cosy
place
and
the
glowing
hues
of
its
furnishings
were
very
becoming
to
saumarez
who
sat
there
writing
industriously
it
was
a
thought
embarrassing
they
had
avoided
one
another
yesterday
rather
obviously
both
striving
to
put
off
a
necessarily
awkward
meeting
now
it
had
come
and
now
somehow
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
and
they
laughed
frankly
and
the
awkwardness
was
gone
kathleen
said
woods
with
conviction
you
a
dear
you
broke
my
heart
said
she
demurely
but
i
going
to
forgive
you
saumarez
was
not
striving
to
be
clever
now
and
heavens
thought
billy
how
much
nicer
she
was
like
this
it
was
the
same
woman
her
thin
cheeks
flushed
and
her
rather
metallic
voice
was
grown
low
and
gentle
billy
brought
memories
with
him
you
see
and
for
the
moment
she
was
kathleen
eppes
again
kathleen
eppes
in
the
first
flush
of
youth
eager
trustful
and
as
he
had
known
her
long
ago
since
then
the
poor
woman
had
eaten
of
the
bread
of
dependence
and
had
found
it
salt
enough
she
had
paid
for
it
daily
enduring
a
thousand
petty
slights
a
thousand
petty
insults
and
smiling
under
them
as
only
women
can
but
she
had
forgotten
now
that
shrewd
kathleen
saumarez
who
must
earn
her
livelihood
as
best
she
might
she
smiled
frankly
a
purely
unprofessional
smile
i
was
sorry
when
i
heard
you
were
coming
she
said
irrelevantly
but
i
glad
now
woods
i
grieve
to
relate
was
still
holding
her
hand
in
his
there
stirred
in
his
pulses
the
thrill
kathleen
eppes
had
always
wakened
a
thrill
of
memory
now
a
mere
wraith
of
emotion
he
was
thinking
of
a
certain
girl
with
crinkly
hair
and
eyes
that
he
had
likened
to
chrysoberyls
and
he
wondered
whimsically
what
had
become
of
her
this
was
not
she
this
was
assuredly
not
kathleen
for
this
woman
had
a
large
mouth
a
humorous
and
kindly
mouth
it
was
true
but
undeniably
a
large
one
whereas
kathleen
mouth
had
been
quite
perfect
and
rather
diminutive
than
otherwise
had
he
rhymed
of
it
often
enough
to
know
they
stood
gazing
at
one
another
for
a
long
time
and
in
the
back
of
billy
brain
lines
of
his
old
verses
sang
themselves
to
a
sad
little
tune
the
verses
that
reproved
the
idiocy
of
all
other
poets
who
had
very
foolishly
written
their
sonnets
to
other
women
and
yet
as
the
jingle
pointed
out
had
these
poets
ever
strayed
in
thy
path
they
had
not
made
random
rhymes
of
arabella
songs
of
dolly
hymns
of
stella
lays
of
lalage
or
chloris
not
of
daphne
nor
of
doris
florimel
nor
amaryllis
nor
of
phyllida
nor
phyllis
were
their
wanton
melodies
but
all
of
these
all
their
melodies
had
been
of
thee
kathleen
would
they
have
been
billy
thought
it
improbable
the
verses
were
very
silly
and
recalling
the
big
blundering
boy
who
had
written
them
billy
began
to
wonder
somewhat
forlornly
whither
he
too
had
vanished
he
and
the
girl
he
had
gone
mad
for
both
seemed
rather
mythical
legendary
as
king
pepin
yes
said
saumarez
and
oh
she
startled
him
i
fancy
both
quite
dead
by
now
billy
she
cried
earnestly
do
laugh
at
them
do
laugh
at
those
dear
foolish
children
i
somehow
i
could
bear
that
billy
kathleen
said
woods
in
admiration
you
a
witch
i
laughing
though
my
dear
i
was
developing
quite
a
twilight
mood
over
them
a
plaintive
sort
of
mood
you
know
she
sighed
a
little
yes
i
know
then
her
eyelids
flickered
in
a
parody
of
kathleen
glance
that
billy
noted
with
a
queer
tenderness
come
and
talk
to
me
billy
she
commanded
i
an
early
bird
this
morning
and
entitled
to
the
very
biggest
and
worm
i
can
find
you
only
a
worm
you
know
we
all
worms
jukesbury
told
me
so
last
night
making
an
exception
in
my
favour
for
it
appears
i
an
angel
he
was
amorously
inclined
last
night
the
tipsy
old
fraud
it
shameless
billy
the
amount
of
money
he
gets
out
of
miss
hugonin
for
the
deserving
poor
do
you
know
i
rather
fancy
he
classes
himself
under
that
head
and
i
grant
you
he
poor
enough
but
deserving
saumarez
snapped
her
fingers
eloquently
eh
shark
eh
queried
woods
in
some
discomfort
she
nodded
he
is
as
bad
as
sarah
haggage
she
informed
him
and
everybody
knows
what
a
bloodsucker
she
is
the
haggage
is
a
disease
billy
that
all
rich
women
are
exposed
to
easily
caught
than
the
pestilence
and
the
taker
runs
presently
mad
depend
upon
it
billy
those
two
will
have
every
penny
they
can
get
out
of
your
uncle
money
peggy
so
generous
he
pleaded
she
wants
to
make
everybody
happy
bring
about
a
general
millenium
you
know
she
pays
dearly
enough
for
her
fancies
said
saumarez
in
a
hard
voice
then
after
a
little
she
cried
suddenly
oh
billy
billy
it
shames
me
to
think
of
how
we
lie
to
her
and
toady
to
her
and
lead
her
on
from
one
mad
scheme
to
another
all
for
the
sake
of
the
money
we
can
pilfer
incidentally
we
all
arrant
hypocrites
you
know
i
no
better
than
the
others
billy
not
a
bit
better
but
my
husband
left
me
so
poor
and
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
the
pretty
things
of
life
and
i
could
i
could
give
them
up
billy
i
love
them
too
dearly
so
i
lie
and
toady
and
write
drivelling
talks
about
things
i
do
understand
for
drivelling
women
to
listen
to
and
i
still
have
the
creature
comforts
of
life
i
pawn
my
for
them
that
all
such
a
little
price
to
pay
it
billy
she
spoke
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
i
dare
say
that
at
the
outset
she
wanted
woods
to
know
the
worst
of
her
knowing
he
could
not
fail
to
discover
it
in
time
billy
brought
memories
with
him
you
see
and
this
shrewd
hard
woman
wanted
somehow
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
that
he
should
think
well
of
her
so
she
babbled
out
the
whole
pitiful
story
waiting
in
a
kind
of
terror
to
see
contempt
and
disgust
awaken
in
his
eyes
but
he
merely
said
i
see
i
see
very
slowly
and
his
eyes
were
kindly
he
could
be
angry
with
her
somehow
that
crinkly
haired
girl
stood
between
them
and
shielded
her
he
was
only
very
very
sorry
and
kennaston
he
asked
after
a
little
saumarez
flushed
kennaston
is
a
man
of
great
genius
she
said
quickly
of
course
miss
hugonin
is
glad
to
assist
him
in
publishing
his
books
it
an
honour
to
her
that
he
permits
it
they
have
to
be
published
privately
you
know
as
the
general
public
capable
of
appreciating
such
dainty
little
masterpieces
oh
make
any
mistake
billy
kennaston
is
a
very
wonderful
and
very
admirable
man
h
yes
he
struck
me
as
being
an
unusually
nice
chap
said
woods
untruthfully
i
dare
say
they
be
very
happy
who
saumarez
demanded
why
er
i
do
suppose
they
make
any
secret
of
it
billy
stammered
in
tardy
repentance
of
his
hasty
speaking
peggy
told
me
last
night
she
had
accepted
him
saumarez
turned
to
rearrange
a
bowl
of
roses
she
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
over
it
billy
she
spoke
inconsequently
and
with
averted
head
an
honest
man
is
the
noblest
work
of
god
and
the
rarest
billy
groaned
do
you
know
said
he
i
just
been
telling
the
roses
in
the
gardens
yonder
the
same
thing
about
women
i
a
misogynist
this
morning
i
decided
no
woman
is
worthy
of
being
loved
that
is
quite
true
she
assented
but
on
the
other
hand
no
man
is
worthy
of
loving
billy
smiled
i
likewise
come
to
the
conclusion
said
he
that
a
man
love
is
like
his
hat
in
that
any
peg
will
do
to
hang
it
on
also
in
that
the
proper
and
best
place
for
it
is
on
his
own
head
oh
i
assure
you
i
vented
any
number
of
cheap
cynicisms
on
the
helpless
roses
and
yet
will
you
believe
it
kathleen
it
does
seem
to
make
me
feel
a
bit
better
no
not
a
bit
it
very
like
his
hat
she
declared
in
that
he
has
a
new
one
every
year
then
she
rested
her
hand
on
his
in
a
fashion
what
the
matter
boy
she
asked
softly
you
always
so
fresh
and
wholesome
i
do
like
to
see
you
like
this
better
leave
to
us
her
voice
rang
true
true
and
compassionate
and
tender
and
all
that
a
woman
voice
should
be
billy
could
not
but
trust
her
i
been
an
ass
said
he
rather
tragically
oh
not
an
unusual
ass
kathleen
just
the
sort
men
are
always
making
of
themselves
you
see
before
i
went
to
france
there
was
a
girl
i
cared
for
and
i
let
a
quarrel
come
between
us
a
foolish
trifling
idle
little
quarrel
kathleen
that
we
might
have
made
up
in
a
but
i
was
too
proud
you
see
no
i
was
proud
either
woods
amended
bitterly
i
was
simply
and
mulish
so
i
went
away
and
yesterday
i
saw
her
again
and
realised
that
i
still
cared
all
kathleen
it
is
an
unusual
story
and
woods
laughed
mirthlessly
and
took
a
turn
on
the
terrace
saumarez
was
regarding
him
intently
her
cheeks
were
of
a
deeper
more
attractive
pink
and
her
breath
came
and
went
quickly
i
i
do
understand
she
said
in
a
rather
queer
voice
oh
it
simple
enough
billy
assured
her
you
see
she
well
i
think
she
would
have
married
me
once
yes
she
cared
for
me
once
and
i
quarreled
with
her
i
conceited
young
ass
that
i
was
actually
presumed
to
dictate
to
the
dearest
sweetest
most
lovable
woman
on
earth
and
tell
her
what
she
must
do
and
what
she
must
i
good
lord
i
who
was
worthy
to
sweep
a
crossing
clean
for
her
who
was
worthy
to
breathe
the
same
air
with
her
who
was
worthy
to
exist
in
the
same
world
she
honoured
by
living
in
oh
i
an
ass
but
i
paid
for
it
oh
yes
kathleen
i
paid
dearly
for
it
and
i
pay
more
dearly
yet
before
i
done
i
tried
to
avoid
her
yesterday
you
must
have
seen
that
and
i
could
i
give
you
my
word
i
could
no
more
have
kept
away
from
her
than
i
could
have
spread
a
pair
of
wings
and
flown
away
she
does
care
a
bit
for
me
now
but
i
can
no
more
give
up
loving
her
than
i
can
give
up
eating
my
dinner
that
is
a
pretty
simile
kathleen
but
it
expresses
the
way
i
feel
toward
her
it
is
merely
that
i
want
her
it
more
than
that
oh
far
more
than
that
i
simply
ca
do
without
her
do
you
understand
kathleen
he
asked
desperately
yes
i
think
i
understand
she
said
when
he
had
ended
i
oh
billy
i
am
almost
sorry
it
dear
of
you
dear
of
you
billy
to
care
for
me
still
but
but
i
almost
sorry
you
care
so
much
i
not
worth
it
boy
dear
and
i
i
really
do
know
what
to
say
you
must
let
me
think
woods
gave
an
inarticulate
sound
the
face
she
turned
to
him
was
perplexed
fond
a
little
pleased
and
strangely
compassionate
it
was
kathleen
eppes
who
sat
beside
him
the
six
years
were
as
utterly
forgotten
as
the
name
of
magdalen
first
lover
she
was
a
girl
again
listening
with
a
heart
that
fluttered
i
dare
say
to
the
wild
talk
the
mad
dithyrambics
of
a
big
blundering
boy
the
ludicrous
horror
of
it
stunned
woods
he
could
no
more
have
told
her
of
her
mistake
than
he
could
have
struck
her
in
the
face
kathleen
said
he
vaguely
let
me
think
ah
let
me
think
billy
she
pleaded
in
a
flutter
of
joy
and
amazement
go
away
boy
dear
go
away
for
a
little
and
let
me
think
i
not
an
emotional
woman
but
i
on
the
verge
of
hysterics
now
for
for
several
reasons
go
in
to
breakfast
billy
i
i
want
to
be
alone
you
made
me
very
proud
and
and
sorry
i
think
and
glad
and
and
oh
i
do
know
boy
dear
but
please
go
now
please
billy
went
in
the
he
paused
to
inspect
a
picture
with
peculiar
interest
since
kathleen
cared
for
him
he
thought
rather
forlornly
he
must
perjure
himself
in
as
plausible
a
manner
as
might
be
possible
please
god
having
done
what
he
had
done
he
would
lie
to
her
like
a
gentleman
and
try
to
make
her
happy
a
vision
in
incredible
violet
ruffles
coming
down
to
breakfast
saw
him
and
paused
on
the
stairway
and
flushed
and
laughed
deliciously
poor
billy
stared
at
her
and
his
heart
gave
a
great
bound
and
then
appeared
to
stop
for
an
indefinite
time
good
lord
said
woods
in
his
soul
and
i
thought
i
was
an
ass
last
night
why
last
night
in
comparison
i
displayed
intelligence
that
was
almost
human
oh
peggy
peggy
if
i
only
dared
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
i
believe
i
would
gladly
die
afterward
yes
i
sure
i
would
you
really
have
any
right
to
be
so
beautiful
it
fair
to
us
peggy
but
the
vision
was
peeping
over
the
bannisters
at
him
and
the
vision
eyes
were
sparkling
with
a
lucent
mischief
and
a
wonderful
contralto
was
demanding
of
him
oh
where
have
you
been
billy
boy
billy
boy
oh
where
have
you
been
charming
billy
and
billy
baritone
answered
her
i
been
to
seek
a
wife
and
broke
off
in
a
groan
good
lord
said
woods
it
was
a
ludicrous
business
if
you
will
indeed
it
was
vastly
humorous
was
it
not
this
woman
thinking
a
man
love
might
by
any
chance
endure
through
six
whole
years
but
their
love
endures
you
see
and
the
silly
creatures
have
a
superstition
among
them
that
love
is
a
sacred
thing
stronger
than
time
victorious
over
death
itself
let
us
laugh
then
at
kathleen
saumarez
those
of
us
who
have
learned
that
love
is
only
a
tinkling
cymbal
and
faith
a
sounding
brass
and
fidelity
an
obsolete
affectation
but
for
my
part
i
honour
and
think
better
of
the
woman
who
through
all
her
struggles
with
the
world
through
all
those
sordid
grim
merciless
secret
battles
where
the
vanquished
may
not
even
cry
for
succour
i
honour
her
i
say
for
that
she
had
yet
cherished
the
memory
of
that
first
love
which
is
the
best
and
purest
and
most
unselfish
and
most
excellent
thing
in
life

breakfast
margaret
enjoyed
hugely
i
regret
to
confess
that
the
fact
that
every
one
of
her
guests
was
more
or
less
miserable
moved
this
young
woman
to
untimely
and
excessive
mirth
only
saumarez
puzzled
her
for
she
could
think
of
no
reason
for
that
manifest
agitation
when
kathleen
eventually
joined
the
others
but
for
the
rest
the
hopeless
glances
that
hugh
van
orden
cast
toward
her
caused
adèle
to
flush
and
haggage
to
become
despondent
and
speechless
and
astonishingly
rigid
and
petheridge
jukesbury
vaguely
apologetic
attitude
toward
the
world
struck
miss
hugonin
as
infinitely
diverting
kennaston
she
pitied
a
little
but
his
bearing
toward
her
ranged
ludicrously
from
that
of
proprietorship
to
that
of
supplication
and
moreover
she
was
furious
with
him
for
having
hinted
at
various
times
that
billy
was
a
margaret
was
quite
confident
by
this
that
she
had
never
believed
him
not
really
you
know
having
argued
the
point
out
at
some
length
the
night
before
and
reaching
her
conclusion
by
a
course
of
reasoning
peculiar
to
herself
woods
as
you
may
readily
conceive
was
sunk
in
the
slough
of
despond
deeper
than
ever
plummet
sounded
margaret
thought
this
very
nice
of
him
it
was
a
delicate
tribute
to
her
that
he
ate
nothing
and
the
fact
that
hugh
van
orden
and
petheridge
jukesbury
as
she
believed
acted
in
precisely
the
same
way
for
precisely
the
same
reason
merely
demonstrated
of
course
their
overwhelming
conceit
and
presumption
so
sitting
in
the
great
eagle
shadow
she
ate
a
quantity
of
marmalade
she
was
wont
to
begin
the
day
in
this
ungodly
english
fashion
and
gossiped
like
a
brook
trotting
over
sunlit
pebbles
she
had
planned
a
pulverising
surprise
for
the
and
in
due
time
she
intended
to
explode
it
and
subsequently
billy
was
to
apologise
for
his
conduct
and
then
they
were
to
live
happily
ever
afterward
she
had
not
yet
decided
what
he
was
to
apologise
for
that
was
his
affair
his
conscience
ought
to
have
told
him
by
this
wherein
he
had
offended
and
if
his
conscience
had
why
then
of
course
he
would
have
to
apologise
for
his
lack
of
proper
sensibility
after
breakfast
she
went
according
to
her
usual
custom
to
her
father
rooms
for
as
i
think
i
have
told
you
the
old
gentleman
was
never
visible
until
noon
she
had
astonishing
news
for
him
what
time
she
divulged
it
the
others
sat
on
the
terrace
and
kennaston
read
to
them
as
he
had
promised
from
his
defense
of
ignorance
it
proved
a
welcome
diversion
to
more
than
one
of
the
party
woods
especially
esteemed
it
a
godsend
it
staved
off
misfortune
for
at
least
a
little
so
he
sat
at
kathleen
side
in
silence
trying
desperately
to
be
happy
trying
desperately
not
to
see
the
tiny
wrinkles
the
faint
crow
feet
time
had
sketched
in
her
face
as
a
memorandum
of
the
work
he
meant
to
do
shortly
billy
consoled
himself
with
the
reflection
that
he
was
very
fond
of
her
but
oh
he
thought
what
worship
what
adoration
he
could
accord
this
woman
if
she
would
only
decline
positively
to
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
him
i
think
we
ought
not
to
miss
hearing
kennaston
discourse
it
is
generally
conceded
that
his
style
is
wonderfully
clever
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
his
detractors
who
complain
that
his
style
is
mere
a
mere
inversion
of
the
most
ancient
truisms
are
actuated
by
the
very
basest
jealousy
let
us
listen
then
and
be
duly
edified
as
he
reads
in
a
low
sweet
voice
and
the
birds
twitter
about
him
in
the
clear
morning
it
has
been
for
many
years
kennaston
began
the
custom
of
patriotic
gentlemen
in
quest
of
office
to
point
with
pride
to
the
fact
that
the
schoolmaster
is
abroad
in
the
land
in
whose
defense
they
stand
pledged
to
draw
their
salaries
and
fight
to
the
last
gasp
for
reelection
these
lofty
platitudes
while
trying
to
the
lungs
doubtless
appeal
to
a
certain
class
of
minds
but
indeed
the
schoolmaster
is
not
abroad
he
is
domesticated
in
every
village
in
america
where
each
hamlet
has
its
shakespeare
and
each
shakespeare
has
his
by
heart
learning
is
rampant
in
the
land
and
valuable
information
is
pasted
up
in
the
streetcars
so
that
he
who
rides
may
read
and
ignorance
beautiful
divine
ignorance
is
forsaken
by
a
generation
that
clamours
for
the
truth
and
what
value
pray
has
this
truth
that
we
should
lust
after
it
he
glanced
up
in
an
inquiring
fashion
jukesbury
meeting
his
eye
smiled
and
shook
his
head
and
said
fie
fie
very
placidly
to
do
him
justice
he
had
not
the
least
idea
what
kennaston
was
talking
about
i
am
aware
the
poet
continued
with
an
air
of
generosity
that
many
pleasant
things
have
been
said
of
it
in
fact
our
decade
has
turned
its
back
relentlessly
upon
the
decayed
and
we
no
longer
read
the
lament
over
the
lost
art
of
lying
issued
many
magazines
ago
by
a
once
prominent
british
author
still
without
advancing
any
wilde
theories
one
may
fairly
claim
that
truth
is
a
jewel
a
jewel
with
many
facets
differing
in
appearance
from
each
point
of
view
and
while
the
truth
and
shame
the
devil
is
a
very
pretty
sentiment
it
need
not
necessarily
mean
anything
the
devil
if
there
be
a
personal
devil
and
it
has
been
pointed
out
with
some
show
of
reason
that
an
impersonal
one
could
scarcely
carry
out
such
enormous
contracts
would
in
all
probability
rather
approve
than
otherwise
of
indiscriminate
irritation
is
the
root
of
all
evil
and
there
is
nothing
more
irritating
than
to
hear
the
truth
about
self
it
is
bad
enough
in
all
conscience
to
be
insulted
but
the
truth
of
an
insult
is
the
barb
that
prevents
its
retraction
hurts
has
all
the
pathos
of
understatement
it
not
only
hurts
but
infuriates
it
has
no
more
right
to
go
naked
in
public
than
any
one
else
indeed
it
has
less
right
for
is
natural
to
mankind
as
is
shown
by
its
prevalence
among
the
younger
sort
such
as
children
and
cynics
and
as
shakespeare
long
ago
forgot
to
tell
us
a
touch
of
nature
makes
the
whole
world
embarrassed
at
this
point
haggage
sniffed
she
considered
he
was
growing
improper
she
distrusted
nature
then
may
safely
be
regarded
as
an
unamiable
indiscretion
in
art
the
bare
truth
must
in
common
gallantry
be
awarded
a
print
petticoat
or
one
of
canvas
as
the
case
may
be
to
hide
her
nakedness
and
in
life
it
is
a
disastrous
virtue
that
we
have
united
to
commend
and
avoid
nor
is
the
decision
an
unwise
one
for
man
is
a
gregarious
animal
knowing
that
friendship
is
at
best
but
a
feeble
passion
and
therefore
to
be
treated
with
the
care
due
an
invalid
it
is
impossible
to
be
quite
candid
in
conversation
with
a
man
and
with
a
woman
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
your
speech
should
be
candied
truth
then
is
the
least
desirable
of
acquaintances
but
even
if
one
wished
to
know
the
truth
the
desire
could
scarcely
be
fulfilled

no

mild
buzz

protest
rose
about

kennaston
smiled
and
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
we
have
for
example
he
pointed
out
a
large
number
of
proverbs
the
small
coin
of

received
everywhere
whose
value
no

disputes
they
are
rapped
forth
like
an
oath
with
an
air
of
settling
the
question

in
quotations

can
do
agrees

thereof

reconcile
care
of
the
pence
and
the
pounds
will
take
care
of
themselves
with
the
equally
familiar
yet
the
sayings
are
equally
untrue
any
maxim
is
perforce
a
general
statement
and
therefore
fallacious
and
therefore
universally
accepted
art
is
long
and
life
is
short
but
the
platitudes
concerning
them
are
both
insufferable
and
eternal
we
must
remember
that
a
general
statement
is
merely
a
at
flying
truth
an
instantaneous
photograph
of
a
moving
body
it
may
be
the
way
that
a
thing
is
but
it
is
never
the
way
in
which
any
one
ever
saw
that
thing
or
ever
will
this
is
of
course
a
general
statement
as
to
present
events
then
it
may
be
assumed
that
no
one
is
either
capable
or
desirous
of
speaking
the
truth
why
then
make
such
a
pother
about
it
as
to
the
past
there
we
have
carried
the
investigation
of
truth
to
such
an
extreme
that
nowadays
very
few
of
us
dare
believe
anything
opinions
are
difficult
to
secure
when
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
library
will
prove
either
side
of
any
question
formerly
people
had
a
few
opinions
which
if
erroneous
were
at
least
universal
nero

not
considered

immaculate

the

now
all
these
comfortable
illusions

little

spend
their

lose
their

in
chasing
nimble
and
retiring

to
the
extreme

up

a
moment

dropping

stealthily
into

all
learn
the
true
facts

we

no

the

not
escape

paused
margaret
had
appeared
in
the
vestibule
and
behind
her
stood
her
father
looking
very
grave
we
have
made
a
most
interesting
discovery
miss
hugonin
airily
announced
to
the
world
at
large
it
appears
that
uncle
fred
left
all
his
property
to
woods
here
we
found
the
will
only
last
night
sure
you
all
be
interested
to
learn
i
a
pauper
now
and
intend
to
support
myself
by
plain
sewing
any
work
of
this
nature
you
may
choose
to
favour
me
with
ladies
and
gentlemen
will
receive
my
most
attention
she
dropped
a
courtesy
the
scene
appealed
to
her
taste
for
the
dramatic
billy
came
toward
her
quickly
peggy
he
demanded
of
her
in
the
of
the
vestibule
will
you
kindly
elucidate
the
meaning
of
this
da
this
idiotic
foolishness
why
this
she
explained
easily
and
exhibited
a
folded
paper
i
found
it
in
the
grate
last
night
he
inspected
it
with
large
eyes
that
absurd
he
said
at
length
you
know
perfectly
well
this
will
is
worth
the
paper
it
written
on
my
dear
sir
she
informed
him
coldly
you
are
vastly
mistaken
you
see
i
burned
the
other
one
she
pushed
by
him
kennaston
are
you
ready
for
our
walk
we
finish
the
paper
some
other
time
was
it
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
her
dear
deep
mellow
voice
died
away
as
she
and
kennaston
disappeared
in
the
gardens
billy
gasped
but
meanwhile
colonel
hugonin
had
given
the
members
of
his
some
inkling
as
to
the
present
posture
of
affairs
they
were
gazing
at
billy
woods
rather
curiously
he
stood
in
the
vestibule
of
selwoode
staring
after
margaret
hugonin
but
they
stared
at
him
and
over
his
curly
head
sculptured
above
the
they
saw
the
eagle
the
symbol
of
the
crude
incalculable
power
of
wealth
woods
stood
in
the
vestibule
of
his
own
house
xvii
by
gad
said
colonel
hugonin
very
grimly
anybody
would
think
you
just
lost
a
fortune
instead
of
inheriting
one
wish
you
joy
of
it
billy
i
ai
saying
you
know
we
sha
miss
it
my
daughter
and
i
no
begad
for
it
a
nice
pot
of
money
and
we
miss
it
damnably
but
since
somebody
had
to
have
it
i
much
rather
it
was
you
my
boy
than
a
set
of
infernal
hypocritical
philanthropic
sharks
and
i
damn
glad
frederick
has
done
the
square
thing
by
you
yes
begad
the
old
gentleman
was
standing
beside
woods
in
the
vestibule
of
selwoode
some
distance
from
the
other
members
of
the
and
was
speaking
in
confidence
he
was
sincere
i
do
say
that
the
thought
of
facing
the
world
at
with
practically
no
resources
save
his
i
think
i
have
told
you
that
the
colonel
diversions
had
drunk
up
his
wife
fortune
and
his
own
like
a
glass
of
water
i
do
say
that
this
thought
moved
him
to
hilarity
over
it
indeed
he
pulled
a
frankly
grave
face
but
he
cared
a
deal
for
billy
and
even
now
there
was
balm
soothing
priceless
balm
to
be
had
of
the
reflection
that
this
change
in
his
prospects
affected
materially
the
prospects
of
those
cultured
philanthropic
persons
who
had
aforetime
set
his
daughter
to
requiring
of
him
a
perusal
of
herbert
spencer
billy
was
pretty
well
aware
how
monetary
matters
stood
with
the
old
wastrel
and
the
sincerity
of
the
man
affected
him
far
more
than
the
most
disinterested
sentiments
would
have
done
woods
accordingly
shook
hands
with
entirely
unnecessary
violence
you
a
trump
that
what
you
are
he
declared
oh
yes
you
are
colonel
you
an
incorrigible
incurable
old
ace
of
trumps
the
very
best
there
is
in
the
pack
and
it
entirely
useless
for
you
to
attempt
to
conceal
it
gad
said
the
colonel
and
do
you
worry
about
that
will
woods
advised
i
i
explain
things
just
now
but
it
all
right
you
just
wait
just
wait
till
i
seen
peggy
billy
urged
in
desperation
and
i
explain
everything
by
gad
said
the
colonel
but
woods
was
out
of
the
vestibule
woods
was
in
an
unenviable
state
of
perturbation
he
could
not
quite
believe
that
peggy
had
destroyed
the
will
the
thing
herod
margaret
but
if
she
had
it
struck
him
as
a
proceeding
entailing
certain
vague
penalties
made
and
provided
by
the
law
to
cover
just
such
cases
penalties
of
whose
nature
he
was
entirely
ignorant
and
care
to
think
heavens
for
all
he
knew
that
angel
might
have
let
herself
in
for
a
jail
sentence
billy
pictured
that
queen
among
women
that
paragon
with
her
glorious
hair
cropped
and
her
little
hands
set
to
beating
hemp
he
had
a
shadowy
notion
that
the
lives
of
all
female
convicts
were
devoted
to
this
pursuit
and
groaned
in
horror
in
the
name
of
heaven
woods
demanded
of
his
soul
what
reason
could
she
have
had
for
this
new
insanity
and
in
the
name
of
heaven
why
could
she
have
put
off
her
with
kennaston
long
enough
to
explain
and
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
does
she
see
to
admire
in
that
grimacing
ass
any
way
and
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
am
i
to
say
to
this
poor
old
man
here
i
ca
explain
that
his
daughter
is
in
any
danger
of
being
poor
but
merely
of
being
locked
up
in
jail
and
in
the
name
of
heaven
how
long
does
that
outrageous
angel
expect
me
to
remain
in
this
state
of
suspense
billy
groaned
again
and
paced
the
vestibule
then
he
retraced
his
steps
shook
hands
with
colonel
hugonin
once
more
and
kennaston
or
no
kennaston
set
out
to
find
her
xviii
but
when
he
came
out
upon
the
terrace
sarah
ellen
haggage
stopped
him
stopped
him
with
a
queer
blending
of
diffidence
and
resolve
in
her
manner
the
others
by
this
had
disappeared
in
various
directions
puzzled
and
exceedingly
uncertain
what
to
do
indeed
to
congratulate
billy
in
the
colonel
presence
would
have
been
tactless
and
on
the
other
hand
to
condole
with
the
colonel
without
seeming
to
affront
the
wealthy
woods
was
almost
impossible
so
they
temporised
and
fled
all
save
haggage
she
alone
remained
to
view
woods
with
newly
opened
eyes
for
as
he
paused
impatiently
the
sculptured
eagle
above
his
head
she
perceived
that
he
was
a
remarkably
handsome
and
intelligent
young
man
her
motherly
heart
opened
toward
this
lonely
wealthy
orphan
my
dear
billy
she
cooed
with
asthmatic
gentleness
as
an
old
old
friend
of
your
mother
are
you
going
to
let
me
tell
you
how
rejoiced
adèle
and
i
are
over
your
good
fortune
it
is
polite
you
naughty
boy
for
you
to
run
away
from
your
friends
as
soon
as
heard
this
wonderful
news
ah
such
news
it
was
such
a
manifest
intervention
of
providence
my
heart
has
been
fluttering
fluttering
like
a
little
bird
billy
ever
since
i
heard
it
in
testimony
to
this
fact
haggage
clasped
a
stodgy
hand
to
an
exceedingly
capacious
bosom
and
exhibited
the
whites
of
her
eyes
freely
her
smile
however
remained
unchanged
and
ample
er
ah
oh
yes
very
kind
of
you
i
sure
said
woods
i
never
in
my
life
saw
adèle
so
deeply
affected
by
haggage
continued
with
a
certain
large
archness
the
sweet
child
was
always
so
fond
of
you
you
know
billy
ah
i
remember
distinctly
hearing
her
speak
of
you
many
and
many
a
time
when
you
were
in
that
dear
delightful
wicked
paris
and
wonder
when
you
would
come
back
to
your
friends
not
very
grand
and
influential
friends
billy
but
sincere
i
trust
for
all
that
woods
said
he
had
no
doubt
of
it
so
many
people
she
informed
him
confidentially
will
pursue
you
with
adulation
now
that
you
are
wealthy
oh
yes
you
will
find
that
wealth
makes
a
great
difference
billy
but
not
with
adèle
and
me
no
dear
boy
despise
us
if
you
will
but
my
child
and
i
are
not
mercenary
money
makes
no
difference
with
us
we
shall
be
the
same
to
you
that
we
always
were
sincerely
interested
in
your
true
welfare
overjoyed
at
your
present
good
fortune
prayerful
as
to
your
brilliant
future
and
delighted
to
have
you
drop
in
any
evening
to
dinner
we
do
not
consider
money
the
chief
blessing
of
life
no
do
tell
me
that
most
people
are
different
billy
for
i
know
it
very
well
and
many
is
the
tear
that
thought
has
cost
me
we
live
in
a
very
mercenary
world
my
dear
boy
but
thoughts
at
least
are
set
on
higher
things
and
i
trust
we
can
afford
to
despise
the
merely
temporal
blessings
of
life
and
i
entreat
you
to
remember
that
our
humble
dwelling
is
always
open
to
the
son
of
my
old
old
friend
and
that
there
is
always
a
jug
of
good
whiskey
in
the
cupboard
thus
in
the
shadow
of
the
eagle
babbled
the
woman
whom
for
all
her
absurdities
margaret
had
loved
as
a
mother
billy
thanked
her
with
an
angry
heart
and
this
i
give
you
the
gist
of
his
meditations
this
is
dearest
friend
oh
philanthropy
are
thy
protestations
then
all
void
and
empty
and
are
thy
noblest
sentiments
every
one
of
so
full
of
sound
and
rhetoric
so
specious
so
delectable
are
these
then
but
dicers
oaths
aloud
i
rather
surprised
you
know
he
said
slowly
that
you
take
it
just
this
way
haggage
i
should
have
thought
you
have
been
sorry
on
on
miss
hugonin
account
it
awfully
jolly
of
you
of
course
oh
awfully
jolly
and
i
appreciate
it
at
its
true
worth
i
assure
you
but
it
a
bit
awkward
is
it
that
the
poor
girl
will
be
practically
penniless
i
really
do
know
whom
she
turn
to
now
then
billy
the
diplomatist
received
a
surprise
she
come
with
me
of
course
said
haggage
woods
made
an
unfortunately
inaudible
observation
i
beg
your
pardon
she
queried
then
obtaining
no
response
she
continued
with
perfect
simplicity
margaret
quite
like
a
daughter
to
me
you
know
of
course
she
and
the
colonel
will
come
with
us
at
least
until
affairs
are
a
bit
more
settled
even
afterward
well
we
have
a
large
house
billy
and
i
do
see
that
they
be
any
better
off
anywhere
else
billy
emotions
were
complex
you
old
parasite
his
own
heart
was
singing
if
you
could
only
keep
that
ring
of
truth
that
in
your
voice
for
your
platform
utterances
why
in
less
than
no
time
you
could
afford
to
feed
your
on
nightingales
tongues
and
clothe
every
in
the
land
in
cloth
of
gold
you
been
pilfering
from
peggy
for
years
pilfering
right
and
left
with
both
hands
but
loved
her
all
the
time
god
bless
you
and
now
the
moment
she
in
trouble
you
ready
to
take
both
her
and
the
colonel
whom
by
the
way
you
must
very
cordially
detest
and
share
your
pitiful
pilfered
little
crusts
with
and
having
two
more
mouths
to
feed
probably
pilfer
a
little
more
outrageously
in
the
future
you
a
sanctimonious
old
hypocrite
you
are
and
a
pious
fraud
and
a
delusion
and
a
snare
and
you
and
adèle
have
nefarious
designs
on
me
at
this
very
moment
but
i
think
i
like
to
kiss
you
indeed
i
believe
woods
came
very
near
doing
so
she
loved
peggy
you
see
and
he
loved
every
one
who
loved
her
but
he
compromised
by
shaking
hands
energetically
for
a
matter
of
five
minutes
and
entreating
to
be
allowed
to
subscribe
to
some
of
her
deserving
charitable
enterprises
any
one
she
might
mention
and
so
left
the
old
lady
a
little
bewildered
but
very
much
pleased
she
decided
that
for
the
future
adèle
must
not
see
so
much
of
van
orden
she
began
to
fear
that
gentleman
views
of
life
were
not
sufficiently
serious
xix
billy
went
into
the
gardens
in
pursuit
of
margaret
he
was
almost
happy
now
and
felt
vaguely
ashamed
of
himself
then
he
came
upon
kathleen
saumarez
who
indeed
was
waiting
for
him
there
and
his
heart
went
down
into
his
boots
he
realised
on
a
sudden
that
he
was
one
of
the
richest
men
in
america
it
was
a
staggering
thought
also
woods
views
at
this
moment
as
to
the
advantages
of
wealth
might
have
been
interesting
kathleen
stood
silent
for
an
instant
eyes
downcast
face
flushed
she
was
trembling
then
billy
she
asked
almost
inaudibly
do
do
you
still
want
your
answer
the
birds
sang
about
them
spring
triumphed
in
the
gardens
she
looked
very
womanly
and
very
pretty
to
all
appearances
it
might
easily
have
been
a
lover
and
his
lass
met
in
the
springtide
shamefaced
after
last
night
kissing
but
billy
somehow
lacked
much
of
the
elation
and
the
perfect
content
and
the
disposition
to
burst
into
melody
that
is
currently
supposed
to
seize
upon
rustic
swains
at
such
moments
he
merely
wanted
to
know
if
at
any
time
in
the
remote
future
his
heart
would
be
likely
to
resume
the
discharge
of
its
proper
functions
it
was
standing
still
now
however
can
you
ask
dear
his
words
at
least
lied
gallantly
the
poor
woman
looked
up
into
billy
face
after
years
of
battling
with
the
world
here
for
the
asking
was
peace
and
luxury
and
wealth
incalculable
and
as
kathleen
thought
a
love
that
had
endured
since
they
were
boy
and
girl
together
yet
she
shrunk
from
him
a
little
and
clinched
her
hands
before
she
spoke
yes
kathleen
faltered
and
afterward
she
shuddered
and
here
if
for
the
moment
i
may
prefigure
the
eagle
as
a
sentient
being
i
can
imagine
his
chuckle
please
god
thought
poor
billy
i
will
make
her
happy
yes
please
god
i
can
at
least
do
that
since
she
cares
for
me
then
he
kissed
her
my
dear
said
he
aloud
i
try
to
make
you
happy
and
and
you
do
mind
do
you
if
i
leave
you
now
queried
this
ardent
lover
you
see
it
absolutely
necessary
i
should
see
see
miss
hugonin
about
this
will
business
you
do
mind
very
much
do
you
darling
woods
inquired
of
her
the
last
word
being
rather
obviously
an
afterthought
no
said
she
not
if
you
must
dear
billy
went
away
lugging
a
heart
of
lead
in
his
breast
kathleen
stared
after
him
and
gave
a
hard
wringing
motion
of
her
hands
she
had
done
what
many
women
do
daily
the
thing
is
common
and
sensible
and
universally
commended
but
in
her
own
eyes
the
draggled
trollop
of
the
pavements
was
neither
better
nor
worse
than
she
at
the
entrance
of
the
next
walkway
billy
encountered
felix
kennaston
alone
and
in
the
most
ebulliently
mirthful
of
humours
xx
but
we
had
left
kennaston
i
think
in
company
with
miss
hugonin
at
the
precise
moment
she
inquired
of
him
whether
it
were
not
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
referring
thereby
to
the
sudden
manner
in
which
she
had
been
disinherited
the
poet
laughed
and
assented
afterward
turning
north
from
the
front
court
they
descended
past
the
griffins
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
each
shield
is
adorned
with
a
of
the
eagle
that
guard
the
broad
stairway
leading
to
the
formal
gardens
of
selwoode
the
gardens
stretch
northward
to
the
confines
of
peter
blagden
estate
of
gridlington
and
for
my
part
unless
it
were
that
primitive
garden
that
adam
lost
i
can
imagine
no
goodlier
place
on
this
particular
forenoon
however
neither
miss
hugonin
nor
felix
kennaston
had
eyes
for
its
comeliness
silently
they
braved
the
griffins
and
in
silence
they
skirted
the
in
the
may
morning
and
passed
through
cloistral
walks
and
amphitheatres
of
green
velvet
and
terraces
ample
and
mellow
in
the
sunlight
silently
the
trees
pelted
them
with
blossoms
pedestaled
in
leafy
recesses
satyrs
grinned
at
them
apishly
and
the
arrows
of
divers
cupids
threatened
them
and
fauns
piped
for
them
ditties
of
no
tone
the
birds
were
about
shrill
avocations
overhead
and
everywhere
the
heatless
odourful
air
was
a
caress
but
for
all
this
miss
hugonin
and
kennaston
were
silent
and
very
fidgetty
margaret
was
hatless
and
the
glory
of
the
eminently
sensible
spring
sun
appeared
to
centre
in
her
hair
and
and
the
gown
like
most
of
her
gowns
was
all
tiny
tucks
and
frills
and
flounces
diapered
with
unsubstantial
mere
violet
froth
as
she
came
through
the
gardens
the
impudent
wind
trifling
with
her
hair
i
protest
she
might
have
been
some
lady
of
oberon
court
stolen
out
of
elfland
to
bedevil
us
poor
mortals
with
only
a
moonbeam
for
the
changeable
heart
of
her
and
for
raiment
a
violet
shadow
spirited
from
the
under
side
of
some
big
fleecy
cloud
they
came
presently
through
a
trim
walkway
to
a
covered
with
vines
into
which
margaret
peeped
and
declined
to
enter
on
the
ground
that
it
was
entirely
too
chilly
and
gloomy
and
like
a
mausoleum
but
nearby
they
found
a
marble
bench
about
which
a
group
of
made
a
pleasant
shadow
splashed
at
just
the
proper
intervals
with
sunlight
on
this
margaret
seated
herself
and
then
pensively
moved
to
the
other
end
of
the
bench
because
a
slanting
sunbeam
fell
there
since
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
blast
kennaston
dearest
hopes
she
thoughtfully
endeavoured
to
distract
his
attention
from
his
own
miseries
as
far
as
might
be
possible
by
showing
him
how
exactly
like
an
aureole
her
hair
was
in
the
sunlight
margaret
always
had
a
kind
heart
kennaston
stood
before
her
smiling
a
little
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
appreciate
the
manoeuver
my
lady
he
asked
very
softly
have
you
any
good
news
for
me
on
this
wonderful
morning
excellent
news
margaret
assented
with
a
cheerfulness
that
was
not
utterly
free
from
trepidation
i
decided
not
to
marry
you
beautiful
and
i
trust
you
properly
grateful
you
see
you
very
nice
of
course
but
i
going
to
marry
somebody
else
and
bigamy
is
a
crime
you
know
and
anyhow
i
only
a
pauper
and
you
never
be
able
to
put
up
with
my
temper
now
beautiful
i
quite
sure
you
could
so
there
not
a
bit
of
use
in
arguing
it
some
day
end
by
strangling
me
which
would
be
horribly
disagreeable
for
me
and
then
they
hang
you
for
it
you
know
and
that
would
be
equally
disagreeable
for
you
fancy
though
what
a
good
advertisement
it
would
be
for
your
poems
illustration
lady
he
asked
very
softly
you
any
good
news
for
me
on
this
wonderful
morning
she
was
not
looking
at
him
now
oh
no
margaret
was
far
too
busily
employed
getting
the
will
which
she
had
carried
all
this
time
into
an
absurd
little
silver
hanging
at
her
waist
she
had
no
time
to
look
at
felix
kennaston
there
was
such
scant
room
in
the
bag
her
purse
took
up
so
much
space
there
was
scarcely
any
left
for
the
folded
paper
the
affair
really
required
her
closest
undivided
attention
besides
she
had
not
the
least
desire
to
look
at
kennaston
just
now
beautiful
child
he
pleaded
look
at
me
but
she
did
she
felt
that
at
that
moment
she
could
have
looked
at
a
gorgon
say
or
a
cockatrice
or
any
other
trifle
of
that
nature
with
infinitely
greater
composure
the
pause
that
followed
margaret
accordingly
devoted
to
a
scrutiny
of
his
shoes
and
sincere
regret
that
their
owner
was
not
a
mercenary
man
who
would
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
beautiful
child
spoke
the
poet
voice
sadly
you
are
surely
you
are
saying
this
in
mistaken
kindness
to
me
surely
you
saying
this
because
of
what
has
happened
in
regard
to
your
money
affairs
believe
me
my
dear
that
makes
no
difference
to
me
it
is
you
i
love
you
the
woman
of
my
heart
and
not
a
certain
and
doubtless
desirable
amount
of
metal
disks
and
dirty
paper
now
i
suppose
you
going
to
be
very
noble
and
very
nasty
about
it
observed
miss
hugonin
resentfully
that
my
main
objection
to
you
you
know
that
you
have
any
faults
i
can
recognise
and
feel
familiar
and
friendly
with
my
dear
he
protested
i
assure
you
i
am
not
intentionally
disagreeable
at
that
she
raised
velvet
eyes
to
his
with
a
visible
effort
though
and
smiled
i
know
you
far
too
well
to
think
that
she
said
wistfully
i
know
i
not
worthy
of
you
i
tremendously
fond
of
you
beautiful
but
but
you
see
i
love
somebody
else
margaret
concluded
with
admirable
candour
ah
said
he
in
a
rather
curious
voice
the
painter
chap
eh
then
margaret
face
flamed
in
a
wonderful
glow
of
shame
and
happiness
and
pride
that
must
have
made
the
surrounding
roses
very
hopelessly
jealous
a
quaint
mothering
look
sacred
divine
woke
in
her
great
eyes
as
she
thought
remorsefully
of
how
unhappy
billy
must
be
at
that
very
moment
and
of
how
big
he
was
and
of
his
general
niceness
and
she
desired
very
heartily
that
this
fleshy
young
man
would
make
his
scene
and
have
done
with
it
who
was
he
forsooth
to
keep
her
from
billy
she
wished
she
had
never
heard
of
felix
kennaston
femme
my
brothers
however
yes
said
you
are
a
dear
said
kennaston
with
conviction
in
his
voice
i
dare
say
margaret
was
surprised
but
the
poet
had
taken
her
hand
and
had
kissed
it
reverently
and
then
sat
down
beside
her
twisting
one
foot
under
him
in
a
fashion
he
had
he
was
frankly
grateful
to
her
for
refusing
him
and
the
mask
of
affectation
slipped
she
saw
in
him
another
man
i
am
an
fraud
he
confessed
with
the
gayest
of
smiles
i
am
not
in
love
with
you
and
i
am
inexpressibly
glad
that
you
are
not
in
love
with
me
oh
margaret
margaret
you
do
mind
if
i
call
you
that
do
you
i
shall
have
to
in
any
event
because
i
like
you
so
tremendously
now
that
we
are
not
going
to
be
married
you
have
no
idea
what
a
night
i
spent
i
consider
it
most
peculiar
and
unsympathetic
of
my
hair
not
to
have
turned
gray
i
thought
you
were
going
to
have
me
you
see
margaret
was
far
to
much
astonished
to
be
angry
but
last
night
she
presently
echoed
in
candid
surprise
why
last
night
you
did
know
i
was
poor
he
wagged
a
protesting
forefinger
that
made
no
earthly
difference
he
assured
her
of
course
it
was
the
money
and
in
some
degree
the
moon
that
induced
me
to
make
love
to
you
i
acted
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
just
for
an
instant
the
novelty
of
doing
a
perfectly
sensible
thing
and
marrying
money
is
universally
conceded
to
come
under
that
head
appealed
to
me
so
i
did
it
but
all
the
time
i
was
in
love
with
kathleen
saumarez
why
the
moment
i
left
you
i
began
to
realise
that
not
even
you
and
you
are
quite
the
most
fascinating
and
generally
adorable
woman
i
ever
knew
margaret
i
began
to
realise
i
say
that
not
even
you
could
ever
make
me
forget
that
fact
and
i
was
very
properly
miserable
it
is
extremely
queer
kennaston
continued
after
an
interval
of
meditation
but
falling
in
love
appears
to
be
the
one
utterly
inexplicable
utterly
reasonless
thing
one
ever
does
in
one
life
you
can
usually
think
of
some
more
or
less
plausible
palliation
for
embezzlement
say
or
for
robbing
a
cathedral
or
even
for
committing
suicide
but
no
man
can
ever
explain
how
he
happened
to
fall
in
love
he
simply
did
it
margaret
nodded
sagely
she
knew
now
you
kennaston
was
pleased
to
say
are
infinitely
more
beautiful
younger
more
clever
and
in
every
way
more
attractive
than
kathleen
i
recognise
these
things
clearly
but
it
does
not
appear
somehow
to
alter
the
fact
that
i
am
in
love
with
her
i
think
i
have
been
in
love
with
her
all
my
life
we
were
boy
and
girl
together
margaret
and
and
i
give
you
my
word
kennaston
cried
with
his
boyish
flush
i
worship
her
i
simply
can
not
explain
the
perfectly
unreasonable
way
in
which
i
worship
her
he
was
sincere
he
loved
kathleen
saumarez
as
much
as
he
was
capable
of
loving
any
one
almost
as
much
as
he
loved
to
dilate
on
his
own
peculiarities
and
emotions
margaret
gaze
was
intent
upon
him
yet
she
marvelled
you
made
love
to
me
very
tropically
with
unconcealed
pride
kennaston
assented
did
i
he
said
i
was
in
rather
good
form
last
night
i
thought
and
you
were
actually
prepared
to
marry
me
she
asked
even
after
you
knew
i
was
poor
i
could
very
well
back
out
he
submitted
and
then
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
you
see
he
added
whimsically
i
was
sufficiently
a
conceited
ass
to
fancy
you
cared
a
little
for
me
so
of
course
i
was
going
to
marry
you
and
try
to
make
you
happy
but
how
dear
oh
how
unutterably
dear
it
was
of
you
margaret
to
decline
to
be
made
happy
in
any
such
fashion
and
kennaston
paused
to
chuckle
and
to
regard
her
with
genuine
esteem
and
affection
but
still
her
candid
eyes
weighed
him
and
transparently
found
him
wanting
you
are
thinking
perhaps
what
an
unutterable
cad
i
have
been
he
suggested
yes
you
are
rather
by
way
of
being
a
cad
beautiful
but
i
help
liking
you
somehow
i
dare
say
it
because
you
honest
with
me
nobody
nobody
miss
hugonin
lamented
a
forlorn
little
quiver
in
her
voice
seemed
to
be
honest
with
me
except
you
and
now
i
know
you
were
oh
beautiful
are
i
ever
to
have
any
real
friends
she
pleaded
wistfully
kennaston
had
meant
a
deal
to
her
you
see
he
had
been
the
one
man
she
trusted
she
had
gloried
in
his
fustian
rhetoric
his
glib
artlessness
his
airy
scorn
of
money
and
now
all
this
proved
mere
pinchbeck
on
a
sudden
too
there
woke
in
some
bycorner
of
her
heart
a
queasy
realisation
of
how
near
she
had
come
to
loving
kennaston
the
thought
nauseated
her
my
dear
he
answered
kindly
you
will
have
any
number
of
friends
now
that
you
are
poor
it
was
merely
your
money
that
kept
you
from
having
any
you
see
kennaston
went
on
with
somewhat
the
air
of
one
climbing
upon
his
favourite
hobby
money
is
the
only
thing
that
counts
nowadays
in
america
the
rich
are
necessarily
our
only
aristocracy
it
is
quite
natural
one
can
not
hope
for
an
aristocracy
of
intellect
if
only
for
the
reason
that
not
one
person
in
a
thousand
has
any
and
birth
does
not
count
for
much
of
course
it
is
quite
true
that
all
of
our
remote
ancestors
came
over
with
william
the
conqueror
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
the
number
of
steerage
passengers
his
ships
would
accommodate
must
have
been
little
short
of
marvellous
but
it
is
equally
true
that
the
grandfathers
of
most
of
our
leisure
class
were
either
deserving
or
dishonest
persons
who
either
started
life
on
a
farm
and
studied
euclid
by
the
firelight
and
did
all
the
other
priggish
things
they
thought
would
look
well
in
a
biography
or
else
met
with
marked
success
in
embezzlement
so
money
after
all
is
our
only
standard
and
when
a
woman
is
as
rich
as
you
were
yesterday
she
can
not
hope
for
friends
any
more
than
the
queen
of
england
can
you
could
have
plenty
of
flatterers
toadies
sycophants
anything
in
fine
but
friends
i
do
believe
it
said
margaret
half
angrily
not
a
word
of
it
there
be
some
honest
people
in
the
world
who
do
consider
that
money
is
everything
you
know
there
must
be
beautiful
the
poet
laughed
that
said
he
affably
is
poppycock
you
are
repeating
the
sort
of
thing
i
said
to
you
yesterday
i
am
honest
now
the
best
of
us
margaret
can
not
help
being
impressed
by
the
power
of
money
it
is
the
greatest
power
in
the
world
and
we
can
not
can
not
possibly
look
upon
rich
people
as
being
quite
like
us
we
must
toady
to
them
a
bit
margaret
whether
we
want
to
or
not
the
eagle
intimidates
us
all
i
him
miss
hugonin
announced
with
vehemence
kennaston
searched
his
pockets
after
a
moment
he
produced
a
dollar
bill
and
showed
her
the
eagle
on
it
there
he
said
gravely
is
the
original
of
the
woods
eagle
the
eagle
that
intimidates
us
all
do
you
remember
what
shakespeare
one
always
harks
back
to
shakespeare
to
clinch
an
argument
because
not
even
our
foremost
actors
have
been
able
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
as
somebody
in
dickens
acutely
points
out
dayvilish
clever
fellow
do
you
remember
i
say
what
shakespeare
observes
as
to
this
very
eagle
miss
hugonin
shook
her
little
head
till
it
glittered
in
the
sunlight
like
a
topaz
she
cared
no
more
for
shakespeare
than
the
average
woman
does
and
she
was
never
quite
comfortable
when
he
was
alluded
to
he
says
kennaston
quoted
solemnly
the
eagle
suffers
little
birds
to
sing
and
is
not
careful
what
they
mean
thereby
knowing
that
with
the
shadow
of
his
wing
he
can
at
pleasure
still
their
melody
that
nonsense
said
margaret
calmly
i
have
the
idea
what
you
talking
about
and
i
do
believe
you
have
either
he
waved
the
dollar
bill
with
a
heroical
gesture
here
he
asserted
is
the
eagle
and
by
the
little
birds
i
have
not
a
doubt
he
meant
charity
and
independence
and
kindliness
and
truth
and
the
rest
of
the
standard
virtues
that
is
quite
as
plausible
as
the
interpretation
of
the
average
commentator
the
presence
of
money
chills
these
little
birds
ah
it
is
lamentable
no
doubt
but
it
is
true
i
do
believe
it
said
margaret
quite
as
if
that
settled
the
question
but
now
his
hobby
rowelled
by
opposition
was
spurred
to
loftier
flights
ah
the
power
of
these
great
fortunes
america
has
bred
is
monstrous
he
suddenly
cried
and
always
they
work
for
evil
if
i
were
ever
to
write
a
melodrama
margaret
i
could
wish
for
no
more
villain
than
a
large
fortune
kennaston
paused
and
laughed
grimly
we
cringe
to
the
eagle
said
he
eh
well
why
not
the
eagle
is
very
powerful
and
very
cruel
in
the
south
yonder
the
eagle
has
penned
over
a
million
children
in
his
factories
where
day
by
day
he
drains
the
youth
and
health
and
very
life
out
of
their
tired
bodies
in
men
and
women
are
toiling
for
the
eagle
giving
their
lives
for
the
pittance
that
he
grudges
them
in
countless
mines
and
mills
the
eagle
is
trading
human
lives
for
coal
and
flour
in
wall
street
yonder
the
eagle
is
juggling
as
he
will
with
necessities
thieving
from
the
farmer
thieving
from
the
consumer
thieving
from
the
poor
fools
who
try
to
play
the
eagle
game
and
driving
them
at
will
to
despair
and
ruin
and
death
look
whither
you
may
men
die
that
the
eagle
may
grow
fat
so
the
eagle
thrives
and
daily
the
rich
grow
richer
and
the
poor
grow
poorer
and
the
end
kennaston
paused
staring
into
vacancy
eh
well
said
he
with
a
smile
and
a
snap
of
his
fingers
the
end
rests
upon
the
knees
of
the
gods
but
there
must
need
be
an
end
some
day
and
meanwhile
you
can
not
blame
us
if
we
cringe
to
the
eagle
that
is
master
of
the
world
it
is
human
nature
to
cringe
to
its
master
and
while
human
nature
is
not
always
an
admirable
thing
it
is
i
believe
rather
widely
distributed
margaret
did
not
return
the
smile
like
any
sensible
woman
she
never
tolerated
opinions
that
differed
from
her
own
so
she
waved
his
preachment
aside
you
trying
to
be
eloquent
was
her
observation
and
you
only
succeeded
in
being
very
silly
and
tiresome
go
away
beautiful
you
make
me
awfully
tired
and
i
care
for
you
in
the
least
go
and
talk
to
kathleen
i
shall
be
here
on
this
very
spot
margaret
added
with
commendable
precision
and
an
unaccountable
increase
of
colour
if
if
any
one
should
happen
to
ask
then
kennaston
rose
and
laughed
merrily
you
are
quite
delicious
he
commented
it
will
always
be
a
grief
and
a
puzzle
to
me
that
i
am
not
mad
for
love
of
you
it
is
unreasonable
of
me
he
complained
sadly
and
shook
his
head
but
i
prefer
kathleen
and
i
am
quite
certain
that
somebody
will
ask
where
you
are
i
shall
describe
to
him
the
exact
spot
kennaston
paused
with
a
slight
air
of
apology
if
i
were
you
he
suggested
pleasantly
i
would
move
a
little
just
a
little
to
the
left
that
will
enable
you
to
obtain
to
a
fuller
extent
the
benefit
of
the
sunbeam
which
is
falling
quite
by
accident
of
course
upon
your
hair
you
are
perfectly
right
margaret
in
selecting
that
hedge
as
a
background
its
sombre
green
sets
you
off
to
perfection
he
went
away
chuckling
he
felt
that
margaret
must
think
him
a
devil
of
a
fellow
she
did
though
the
of
his
suspecting
me
of
such
unconscionable
vanity
she
said
properly
offended
then
anyhow
a
man
has
no
business
to
know
about
such
things
she
continued
with
rising
indignation
i
believe
felix
kennaston
is
as
good
a
judge
of
chiffons
as
any
woman
effeminate
i
think
and
catty
and
absurd
i
do
believe
i
ever
liked
him
not
really
that
is
now
what
would
billy
care
about
sunbeams
and
backgrounds
i
like
to
know
he
never
even
notice
them
billy
is
a
why
that
just
what
father
said
yesterday
margaret
cried
and
afterward
laughed
happily
i
suppose
old
people
are
right
sometimes
but
dear
dear
they
terribly
unreasonable
at
others
having
thus
uttered
the
ancient
undying
plaint
of
youth
miss
hugonin
moved
a
matter
of
two
inches
to
the
left
and
smiled
and
waited
contentedly
it
was
barely
possible
some
one
might
come
that
way
and
it
is
always
a
comfort
to
know
that
one
is
not
exactly
repulsive
in
appearance
also
there
was
the
spring
about
her
and
chief
of
all
there
was
a
queer
fluttering
in
her
heart
that
was
yet
not
unpleasant
in
fine
she
was
unreasonably
happy
for
no
reason
at
all
i
believe
the
foolish
poets
call
this
feeling
love
and
swear
it
is
divine
however
they
will
say
anything
for
the
sake
of
an
jingle
and
while
it
is
true
that
scientists
have
any
number
of
plausible
and
interesting
explanations
for
this
same
feeling
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
forgotten
them
i
am
compelled
then
to
fall
back
upon
those
same
unreliable
irresponsible
rhymesters
and
to
insist
with
them
that
a
maid
waiting
in
the
springtide
for
the
man
she
loves
is
necessarily
happy
and
very
rarely
puzzles
her
head
over
the
scientific
reason
for
it
xxi
but
ten
minutes
later
she
saw
woods
in
the
distance
striding
across
the
sunlit
terraces
and
was
seized
with
a
conviction
that
their
interview
was
likely
to
prove
a
stormy
one
there
was
an
ominous
stiffness
in
his
gait
oh
dear
dear
miss
hugonin
wailed
he
in
a
temper
now
and
he
probably
be
just
as
disagreeable
as
it
possible
for
any
one
to
be
i
do
wish
men
were
so
unreasonable
he
looks
exactly
like
a
big
just
now
just
now
when
i
sure
he
has
every
cause
in
the
to
be
very
much
pleased
after
all
i
done
for
him
he
makes
me
awfully
tired
i
think
he
i
i
think
i
rather
afraid
in
fact
she
was
now
that
the
meeting
she
had
anticipated
these
twelve
hours
past
was
actually
at
hand
there
woke
in
her
breast
an
unreasoning
panic
miss
hugonin
considered
and
caught
up
her
skirts
and
whisked
into
the
and
there
sat
down
in
the
darkest
corner
and
devoutly
wished
woods
in
crim
tartary
or
jericho
or
in
a
word
any
region
other
than
the
gardens
of
selwoode
billy
came
presently
to
the
opening
in
the
hedge
and
stared
at
the
deserted
bench
he
was
undeniably
in
a
temper
but
then
how
becoming
it
was
thought
someone
miss
hugonin
he
said
coldly
evidently
thought
someone
he
intends
to
be
just
as
nasty
as
possible
peggy
said
woods
after
a
little
perhaps
thought
someone
he
wo
be
nasty
dear
peggy
said
woods
in
his
most
conciliatory
tone
someone
rearranged
her
hair
complacently
but
there
was
no
answer
save
the
irresponsible
chattering
of
the
birds
and
with
a
sigh
billy
turned
upon
his
heel
then
by
the
oddest
chance
in
the
world
margaret
coughed
i
dare
say
it
was
damp
in
the
or
perhaps
it
was
caused
by
some
passing
bronchial
irritation
or
perhaps
incredible
as
it
may
seem
she
coughed
to
show
him
where
she
was
but
i
scarcely
think
so
because
margaret
insisted
afterward
very
positively
too
that
she
did
cough
at
all
xxii
well
woods
observed
lengthening
the
word
somewhat
in
the
intimate
of
the
he
loomed
prodigiously
big
he
was
gazing
downward
in
careful
consideration
of
three
fat
pins
and
a
surprising
quantity
of
gold
hair
which
was
practically
all
that
he
could
see
of
miss
hugonin
person
for
that
young
lady
had
suddenly
become
a
limp
mass
of
abashed
violet
ruffles
and
had
discovered
new
and
irresistible
attractions
in
the
mosaics
about
her
feet
billy
arms
were
crossed
on
his
breast
and
his
right
hand
caressed
his
chin
meditatively
by
and
bye
i
wonder
now
he
reflected
aloud
if
you
can
give
any
reason
any
possible
reason
why
you
should
be
locked
up
in
the
nearest
sanatorium
you
need
be
rude
you
know
a
voice
observed
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ruffles
because
there
is
anything
you
can
do
about
it
woods
ventured
a
series
of
inarticulate
observations
but
why
he
concluded
desperately
but
why
peggy
in
heaven
name
the
meaning
of
all
this
she
looked
up
billy
was
aware
of
two
large
blue
stars
his
heart
leapt
and
then
he
recalled
a
pair
of
eyes
that
had
regarded
him
in
much
the
same
fashion
not
long
ago
and
he
groaned
i
was
unfair
to
you
last
night
she
said
and
the
ring
of
her
odd
deep
voice
and
the
richness
and
sweetness
of
it
moved
him
to
faint
longing
to
a
sick
it
was
tremulous
too
and
very
tender
yes
i
was
unutterably
unfair
billy
you
asked
me
to
marry
you
when
you
thought
i
was
a
beggar
and
and
uncle
fred
to
have
left
you
the
money
it
was
on
account
of
me
that
he
did
you
know
i
really
owed
it
to
you
and
after
the
way
i
talked
to
you
so
long
as
i
had
the
money
i
and
anyhow
its
very
disagreeable
and
eccentric
and
of
you
to
object
to
being
rich
margaret
concluded
somewhat
incoherently
she
had
not
thought
it
would
be
like
this
he
seemed
so
stern
but
is
that
exactly
like
her
woods
was
demanding
of
his
soul
she
thinks
she
has
been
unfair
to
me
to
me
whom
she
care
a
button
for
mind
you
so
she
hands
over
a
fortune
to
make
up
for
it
simply
because
that
the
first
means
that
comes
to
hand
now
is
that
perfectly
unreasonable
and
fantastic
and
magnificent
and
incredible
in
short
is
that
peggy
all
over
why
god
bless
her
her
heart
bigger
than
a
oh
it
no
wonder
that
fellow
kennaston
was
grinning
just
now
when
he
sent
me
to
her
he
can
afford
to
grin
aloud
he
stated
you
an
angel
peggy
that
what
you
are
always
suspected
it
and
i
glad
to
know
it
now
for
a
fact
but
in
this
prosaic
world
not
even
angels
are
allowed
to
burn
up
wills
for
recreation
why
bless
my
soul
child
you
why
there
no
telling
what
trouble
you
might
have
gotten
into
miss
hugonin
pouted
you
need
be
such
a
grandfather
she
suggested
helpfully
but
it
a
serious
business
he
insisted
at
this
point
billy
began
to
object
to
her
pouting
as
distracting
one
mind
from
the
subject
under
discussion
it
why
it
it
what
she
pouted
even
more
rebelliously
crimson
said
woods
considering
oh
the
very
deepest
duskiest
crimson
such
as
you
ca
get
in
tubes
it
a
colour
was
never
mixed
on
any
palette
it
eh
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
think
you
ought
to
said
margaret
primly
nevertheless
she
had
brightened
considerably
of
course
woods
continued
with
a
fine
colour
i
ca
take
the
money
that
absurd
is
it
she
queried
idly
now
i
wonder
how
you
going
to
help
yourself
simplest
thing
in
the
world
he
assured
her
you
see
this
match
do
you
peggy
well
now
you
going
to
give
me
that
paper
i
see
in
that
at
your
waist
and
i
going
to
burn
it
till
all
nice
soft
feathery
ashes
that
ca
ever
be
probated
and
then
the
first
will
which
is
practically
the
same
as
the
last
will
be
allowed
to
stand
and
i
tell
your
father
all
about
the
affair
because
he
ought
to
know
and
you
have
to
settle
with
those
colleges
and
in
that
way
woods
submitted
uncle
fred
last
wishes
will
be
carried
out
just
as
he
expressed
them
and
there
need
be
any
trouble
none
at
all
so
give
me
the
will
peggy
it
is
curious
what
a
trivial
matter
love
makes
of
felony
margaret
heart
sank
however
yes
said
she
encouragingly
and
what
do
you
intend
doing
afterward
i
i
shall
probably
live
abroad
said
billy
cheaper
you
know
illustration
miss
hugonin
pouted
need
be
such
a
grandfather
she
suggested
helpfully
and
here
he
thought
was
an
excellent
an
opportunity
to
inform
her
of
his
engagement
he
had
much
better
tell
her
now
and
have
done
woods
opened
his
mouth
and
looked
at
margaret
and
closed
it
again
she
was
pouting
in
a
fashion
that
distracted
one
mind
that
would
be
most
unattractive
said
miss
hugonin
calmly
very
stupid
billy
to
think
of
living
abroad
billy
i
think
almost
as
stupid
as
i
am
i
been
very
stupid
billy
i
thought
i
liked
kennaston
i
do
billy
not
that
way
i
just
told
him
so
i
not
i
not
engaged
to
anybody
now
billy
but
was
it
stupid
of
me
to
make
such
a
mistake
billy
that
was
a
very
interesting
mosaic
there
in
the
i
do
understand
said
woods
his
voice
shook
and
his
hands
lifted
a
little
toward
her
and
trembled
poor
billy
dared
not
understand
her
eyes
downcast
her
foot
tapping
the
floor
gently
margaret
was
all
one
blush
she
too
was
trembling
a
little
and
she
was
a
little
afraid
and
quite
unutterably
happy
and
outwardly
she
was
very
much
the
tiny
lady
of
oberon
court
very
much
the
coquette
quintessentialised
it
is
pitiable
that
our
proud
margaret
should
come
to
such
a
pass
ah
the
men
that
you
have
flouted
and
scorned
and
bedeviled
and
mocked
at
margaret
could
they
see
you
now
i
think
the
basest
of
them
could
not
but
pity
and
worship
you
this
man
is
bound
in
honour
to
another
woman
yet
a
little
and
his
lips
will
open
very
dry
parched
lips
they
are
now
and
he
will
tell
you
and
your
pride
will
drive
you
mad
and
your
heart
come
near
to
breaking
do
you
understand
oh
you
silly
billy
she
was
peeping
at
him
meltingly
from
under
her
lashes
i
i
imagining
vain
things
said
woods
i
oh
peggy
peggy
i
think
i
must
be
going
mad
he
stared
hungrily
at
the
pink
startled
face
that
lifted
toward
his
ah
no
no
it
could
not
be
possible
this
thing
he
had
imagined
for
a
moment
he
had
misunderstood
and
now
just
for
a
little
thought
poor
billy
let
my
eyes
drink
in
those
dear
felicities
of
colour
and
curve
and
meet
just
for
a
little
the
splendour
of
those
eyes
that
have
the
april
in
them
and
rest
just
for
a
little
upon
that
sanguine
petulant
mouth
and
then
i
will
tell
her
and
then
i
think
that
i
must
die
peggy
he
began
in
a
flattish
voice
they
have
evidently
gone
said
the
voice
of
kennaston
yes
those
beautiful
happy
young
people
have
foolishly
deserted
the
very
prettiest
spot
in
the
gardens
let
us
sit
here
kathleen
but
i
not
an
eavesdropper
woods
protested
half
angrily
i
fear
margaret
was
not
properly
impressed
please
billy
she
pleaded
in
a
shrill
whisper
please
listen
he
going
to
propose
to
her
now
and
you
no
idea
how
funny
he
is
when
he
proposes
oh
do
be
so
pokey
billy
do
listen
but
woods
had
risen
with
a
strange
celerity
and
was
about
to
leave
the
margaret
pouted
saumarez
and
kennaston
were
seated
not
twenty
feet
from
the
on
the
bench
which
miss
hugonin
had
just
left
and
when
that
unprincipled
young
woman
finally
rose
to
her
feet
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
was
with
a
toss
of
the
head
and
with
the
reflection
that
while
to
listen
was
honourable
it
would
at
least
be
very
amusing
i
grieve
to
admit
it
but
with
scruples
she
had
the
slightest
sympathy
then
kennaston
cried
suddenly
why
you
mad
kathleen
woods
wants
to
marry
why
he
heels
over
head
in
love
with
miss
hugonin
miss
hugonin
turned
to
woods
with
a
little
intake
of
the
breath
no
i
shall
not
attempt
to
tell
you
what
billy
saw
in
her
countenance
i
drape
before
it
the
vines
of
the
for
a
brief
space
i
think
we
had
best
betake
ourselves
outside
leaving
margaret
in
a
very
pitiable
state
of
anger
and
shame
and
humiliation
and
heartbreak
leaving
poor
billy
with
a
heart
that
ached
seeing
the
horror
of
him
in
her
face
xxiii
saumarez
laughed
bitterly
no
she
said
billy
cared
for
me
you
know
a
long
time
ago
and
this
morning
he
told
me
he
still
cared
billy
does
pretend
to
be
a
clever
man
you
see
and
so
he
can
afford
to
practice
some
of
the
brute
virtues
such
as
constancy
and
fidelity
there
was
a
challenging
flame
in
her
eyes
but
kennaston
let
the
stab
pass
unnoticed
to
do
him
justice
he
was
thinking
less
of
himself
just
now
than
of
how
this
news
would
affect
margaret
and
his
face
was
very
grave
and
strangely
tender
for
in
his
own
fashion
he
loved
margaret
it
nasty
very
nasty
he
said
at
length
in
a
voice
that
was
puzzled
yet
i
could
have
sworn
yesterday
kennaston
paused
and
laughed
lightly
she
was
an
heiress
yesterday
and
she
is
nobody
and
woods
being
wealthy
can
afford
to
gratify
the
virtues
you
commend
so
highly
and
with
a
fidelity
that
is
most
edifying
return
again
to
his
old
love
and
she
welcomes
him
and
the
woods
millions
with
open
arms
it
is
quite
affecting
is
it
not
kathleen
you
need
be
disagreeable
she
observed
my
dear
kathleen
i
assure
you
i
am
not
angry
i
am
merely
a
little
sorry
for
human
nature
i
could
have
sworn
woods
was
honest
but
rogues
all
rogues
all
kathleen
money
rules
us
in
the
end
and
now
the
parable
is
fulfilled
and
love
the
prodigal
returns
to
make
merry
over
the
calf
of
gold
confess
kennaston
queried
with
a
smile
is
it
not
strange
an
creator
should
have
been
at
pains
to
fashion
this
brave
world
about
us
for
little
men
and
women
such
as
we
to
lie
and
pilfer
in
was
it
worth
while
think
you
to
arch
the
firmament
above
our
rogueries
and
light
the
ageless
stars
as
candles
to
display
our
antics
let
us
be
frank
kathleen
and
confess
that
life
is
but
a
trivial
farce
ignobly
played
in
a
very
stately
temple
and
kennaston
laughed
again
let
us
be
frank
kathleen
cried
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
why
it
is
in
you
to
be
frank
felix
kennaston
your
life
is
nothing
but
a
succession
of
poses
shallow
foolish
poses
meant
to
hoodwink
the
world
and
at
times
yourself
for
you
do
hoodwink
yourself
do
you
felix
she
asked
eagerly
and
gave
him
no
time
to
answer
she
feared
you
see
lest
his
answer
might
dilapidate
the
one
fortress
she
had
been
able
to
build
about
his
honour
and
now
she
went
on
quickly
you
trying
to
make
me
think
you
a
devil
of
a
fellow
are
you
and
you
hinting
that
i
accepted
billy
because
of
his
money
are
you
well
it
is
true
that
i
would
marry
him
if
he
were
poor
but
he
very
far
from
being
poor
and
he
cares
for
me
and
i
am
fond
of
him
and
so
i
shall
marry
him
and
make
him
as
good
a
wife
as
i
can
so
there
saumarez
faced
him
with
an
uneasy
defiance
he
was
smiling
oddly
i
have
heard
it
rumoured
in
many
foolish
tales
and
jingling
verses
said
kennaston
after
a
little
that
a
thing
called
love
exists
in
the
world
and
i
have
also
heard
kathleen
that
it
sometimes
enters
into
the
question
of
marriage
it
appears
that
i
was
misinformed
no
she
answered
slowly
there
is
a
thing
called
love
i
think
women
are
none
the
better
for
knowing
it
to
a
woman
it
means
to
take
some
man
some
utterly
commonplace
man
perhaps
perhaps
only
an
idle
such
as
you
are
felix
and
to
set
him
up
on
a
pedestal
and
to
bow
down
and
worship
him
and
to
protest
loudly
both
to
the
world
and
to
herself
that
in
spite
of
all
appearances
her
idol
really
has
feet
of
clay
or
that
at
any
rate
it
is
the
very
nicest
clay
in
the
world
for
a
time
she
deceives
herself
felix
then
the
idol
topples
from
the
pedestal
and
is
broken
and
she
sees
that
it
is
all
clay
felix
clay
through
and
through
and
her
heart
breaks
with
it
kennaston
bowed
his
head
it
is
true
said
he
that
is
the
love
of
women
to
a
man
she
went
on
dully
it
means
to
take
some
woman
the
nearest
woman
who
is
actually
deformed
and
to
make
pretty
speeches
to
her
and
to
make
her
love
him
and
after
a
while
kathleen
shrugged
her
shoulders
drearily
why
after
a
while
said
she
he
grows
tired
and
looks
for
some
other
woman
it
is
true
said
kennaston
yes
very
true
that
some
men
love
in
that
fashion
there
ensued
a
silence
it
was
a
long
silence
and
under
the
tension
of
it
kathleen
composure
snapped
like
a
cord
that
has
been
stretched
to
the
breaking
point
yes
yes
yes
she
cried
suddenly
that
is
how
i
have
loved
you
and
that
is
how
you
loved
me
felix
kennaston
ah
billy
told
me
what
happened
last
night
and
that
that
was
why
i
saumarez
paused
and
regarded
him
curiously
you
do
make
a
very
noble
figure
just
now
do
you
she
asked
with
careful
deliberation
you
were
ready
to
sell
yourself
for
miss
hugonin
money
were
you
and
now
you
must
take
her
without
the
money
poor
felix
ah
you
poor
petty
liar
who
yourself
so
utterly
and
again
kathleen
began
to
laugh
but
somewhat
shrilly
somewhat
hysterically
you
are
wrong
he
said
with
a
flush
it
is
true
that
i
asked
miss
hugonin
to
marry
me
but
she
very
wisely
i
dare
say
declined
ah
kathleen
said
slowly
then
and
it
will
not
do
to
inquire
too
closely
into
her
logic
she
spoke
with
considerable
sharpness
a
conceited
little
cat
i
never
in
all
my
life
knew
a
girl
to
be
quite
so
conceited
as
she
is
positively
i
do
believe
she
thinks
a
man
breathing
who
good
enough
for
her
kennaston
grinned
oh
kathleen
kathleen
he
said
you
are
simply
delicious
and
saumarez
coloured
prettily
and
tried
to
look
severe
and
could
not
for
the
simple
reason
that
while
she
knew
kennaston
to
be
flippant
and
weak
and
unstable
as
water
and
generally
worthless
yet
for
some
occult
cause
she
loved
him
as
tenderly
as
though
he
had
been
a
paragon
of
all
the
manly
virtues
and
i
dare
say
that
for
many
of
us
it
is
by
a
very
kindly
provision
of
nature
that
all
women
are
created
capable
of
doing
this
illogical
thing
and
that
most
of
them
do
it
daily
it
is
true
the
poet
said
at
length
that
i
have
played
no
heroic
part
and
i
do
question
kathleen
that
i
am
all
you
think
me
yet
such
as
i
am
i
love
you
and
such
as
i
am
you
love
me
and
it
is
i
that
you
are
going
to
marry
and
not
that
woods
person
he
worth
ten
of
you
she
cried
scornfully
twenty
of
me
perhaps
kennaston
assented
but
that
is
the
question
you
do
love
him
kathleen
you
are
about
to
marry
him
for
his
money
you
are
about
to
do
what
i
thought
to
do
yesterday
but
you
wo
kathleen
you
know
that
i
need
you
my
dear
and
unreasonably
enough
god
knows
you
love
me
saumarez
regarded
him
intently
for
a
considerable
space
and
during
that
space
the
eagle
warred
in
her
heart
with
the
one
foe
he
can
never
conquer
love
had
a
worthless
ally
but
love
fought
staunchly
by
and
bye
yes
she
said
and
her
voice
was
almost
sullen
i
love
you
i
ought
to
love
billy
but
i
do
i
shall
ask
him
to
release
me
from
my
engagement
and
yes
i
will
marry
you
if
you
like
he
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
you
are
an
angel
kennaston
was
pleased
to
say
no
saumarez
dissented
rather
forlornly
i
simply
a
fool
otherwise
i
would
be
about
to
marry
you
knowing
you
as
i
do
for
what
you
are
knowing
that
i
have
one
chance
in
a
hundred
of
any
happiness
my
dear
he
said
and
his
voice
was
earnest
you
know
at
least
that
what
there
is
of
good
in
me
is
at
its
best
with
you
yes
yes
kathleen
cried
quickly
that
is
so
is
it
felix
and
you
do
care
for
me
do
you
felix
are
you
sure
you
care
for
me
quite
sure
and
are
you
quite
certain
felix
that
you
never
cared
so
much
for
any
one
else
kennaston
was
quite
certain
he
proceeded
to
explain
his
feelings
toward
her
at
some
length
kathleen
listened
with
downcast
eyes
and
almost
cheated
herself
into
the
belief
that
the
man
she
loved
was
all
that
he
should
be
but
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
knew
he
was
i
think
we
may
fairly
pity
her
kennaston
and
saumarez
chatted
very
amicably
for
some
ten
minutes
at
the
end
of
that
period
the
twelve
express
bellowing
faintly
in
the
distance
recalled
the
fact
that
the
morning
mail
was
in
and
thereupon
in
the
very
best
of
humours
they
set
out
for
the
house
i
grieve
to
admit
it
but
kathleen
had
utterly
forgotten
billy
by
this
and
was
no
more
thinking
of
him
than
she
was
of
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
she
was
with
kennaston
you
see
and
her
thoughts
and
glances
and
lips
and
adoration
were
all
given
to
his
pleasuring
just
as
her
life
would
have
been
if
its
loss
could
have
saved
him
from
a
toothache
he
strutted
a
little
and
was
a
little
grateful
to
her
and
to
do
him
justice
received
the
tribute
she
accorded
him
with
perfect
satisfaction
and
equanimity
xxiv
margaret
came
out
of
the
billy
woods
followed
her
in
a
very
moist
state
of
perturbation
peggy
said
woods
but
miss
hugonin
was
laughing
clear
as
a
she
poured
forth
her
rippling
mimicry
of
mirth
they
train
women
well
in
these
matters
to
margaret
just
now
her
heart
seemed
dead
within
her
her
lover
was
proved
unworthy
her
pride
was
shattered
she
had
loved
this
clumsy
liar
yonder
had
given
up
a
fortune
for
him
dared
all
for
him
had
as
the
phrase
runs
flung
herself
at
his
head
the
shame
of
it
was
a
physical
sickness
a
nausea
but
now
in
this
jumble
of
miseries
in
this
of
the
earth
and
the
void
heavens
that
surged
about
her
and
would
not
be
mastered
the
girl
laughed
and
her
laughter
was
and
like
that
of
a
child
who
is
thinking
of
something
else
ah
yes
they
train
women
well
in
these
matters
at
length
margaret
said
in
high
crisp
accents
pardon
me
but
i
ca
help
being
amused
woods
by
the
way
in
which
hard
luck
dogs
your
footsteps
i
think
fate
must
have
some
grudge
against
you
mr
woods
peggy
said
woods
pardon
me
she
interrupted
him
her
masculine
little
chin
high
in
the
air
but
i
wish
you
would
call
me
that
it
was
well
enough
when
we
were
boy
and
girl
together
woods
but
you
developed
since
ah
yes
you
developed
into
such
a
splendid
actor
such
a
consummate
liar
such
a
clever
scoundrel
woods
that
i
scarcely
recognise
you
now
and
there
was
not
a
spark
of
anger
in
the
very
darkest
corner
of
billy
big
brave
heart
but
only
pity
pity
all
through
and
through
that
sent
little
icy
ticklings
up
and
down
his
spine
and
turned
his
breathing
to
great
sobs
for
she
had
turned
full
face
to
him
and
he
could
see
the
look
in
her
eyes
i
think
he
has
never
forgotten
it
years
after
the
memory
of
it
would
come
upon
him
suddenly
and
set
hot
drenching
waves
of
shame
and
remorse
surging
about
his
body
remorse
unutterable
that
he
ever
hurt
his
peggy
so
deeply
for
they
were
tragic
eyes
beneath
them
her
twitching
mouth
smiled
bravely
but
the
mirth
of
her
eyes
was
monstrous
it
was
the
mirth
of
a
beaten
woman
of
a
woman
who
has
known
the
last
extreme
of
shame
and
misery
and
has
learned
to
laugh
at
it
even
now
billy
woods
can
not
quite
forget
peggy
said
he
brokenly
ah
dear
dear
peggy
listen
to
me
why
have
you
thought
of
a
plausible
lie
so
soon
she
queried
sweetly
dear
me
woods
what
is
the
use
of
explaining
things
it
is
very
simple
you
wanted
to
marry
me
last
night
because
i
was
rich
and
when
i
declined
the
honour
you
went
back
to
your
old
love
oh
it
very
simple
woods
it
a
pity
though
is
it
that
all
your
promptness
went
for
nothing
why
dear
me
you
actually
managed
to
propose
before
breakfast
did
you
i
should
have
thought
that
such
eagerness
would
have
made
an
impression
on
kathleen
oh
a
most
favourable
impression
too
bad
it
has
listen
said
billy
ah
you
forcing
me
to
talk
like
a
cad
peggy
but
i
ca
see
you
suffer
i
ca
kathleen
misunderstood
what
i
said
to
her
i
i
did
mean
to
propose
to
her
peggy
it
was
a
mistake
i
tell
you
it
you
i
love
just
you
and
when
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
last
night
why
i
thought
the
money
was
mine
peggy
i
never
have
asked
you
if
i
had
thought
that
i
ah
you
believe
me
you
do
believe
me
peggy
and
before
god
i
telling
you
the
simple
truth
why
i
had
ever
seen
that
last
will
peggy
it
was
locked
up
in
that
centre
place
in
the
desk
you
remember
why
why
you
yourself
had
the
keys
to
it
peggy
surely
you
remember
dear
and
billy
voice
shook
and
skipped
whole
octaves
as
he
pleaded
with
her
for
he
knew
she
did
not
believe
him
and
he
could
not
endure
the
horror
of
her
eyes
but
margaret
shook
her
head
and
as
aforetime
the
twitching
lips
continued
to
laugh
beneath
those
tragic
eyes
ah
poor
little
lady
of
elfland
poor
little
undine
with
a
soul
wakened
to
suffering
clumsy
very
clumsy
she
rebuked
him
i
see
that
you
are
accustomed
to
prepare
your
lies
in
advance
woods
as
an
extemporaneous
liar
you
are
very
clumsy
men
do
propose
by
mistake
except
in
farces
and
while
we
are
speaking
of
farces
do
you
think
it
time
to
drop
that
one
of
your
not
knowing
about
that
last
will
the
farce
billy
stammered
you
why
you
saw
me
when
i
found
it
ah
yes
i
saw
you
when
you
pretended
to
find
it
i
saw
you
when
you
pretended
to
unlock
that
centre
place
but
now
of
course
i
know
it
never
was
locked
i
very
careless
about
locking
things
woods
ah
yes
that
gave
you
a
beautiful
opportunity
did
it
so
when
you
were
rummaging
through
my
desk
without
my
permission
by
the
way
but
that
a
detail
you
found
both
wills
and
concocted
your
little
comedy
that
was
very
clever
oh
you
think
you
awfully
smooth
do
you
billy
woods
but
if
you
had
been
a
bit
more
daring
you
see
you
could
have
suppressed
the
last
one
and
taken
the
money
without
being
encumbered
by
me
that
was
rather
clumsy
of
you
it
suave
gentle
sweet
as
honey
was
the
speech
of
margaret
as
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
but
her
eyes
were
tragedies
ah
said
billy
ah
yes
you
think
that
he
was
very
careful
in
articulating
his
words
was
billy
and
afterward
he
nodded
his
head
gravely
the
universe
had
somehow
suffered
an
airy
dissolution
like
that
of
prospero
masque
selwoode
and
its
gardens
the
great
globe
itself
the
towers
the
gorgeous
palaces
the
solemn
temples
were
all
as
vanished
wraiths
there
was
only
peggy
left
peggy
with
that
unimaginable
misery
in
her
eyes
that
he
must
drive
away
somehow
if
that
was
what
she
thought
there
was
no
way
for
him
to
prove
it
was
so
why
dear
me
woods
she
retorted
carelessly
what
else
could
i
think
here
woods
blundered
ah
think
what
you
will
peggy
he
cried
his
big
voice
cracking
and
sobbing
and
resonant
with
pain
ah
my
dear
think
what
you
will
but
do
grieve
for
it
peggy
why
if
i
all
you
say
i
am
that
no
reason
you
should
suffer
for
it
ah
do
peggy
in
god
name
do
i
ca
bear
it
dear
he
pleaded
with
her
helplessly
billy
was
suffering
too
but
her
sorrow
was
the
chief
of
his
and
what
stung
him
now
to
impotent
anger
was
that
she
must
suffer
and
he
be
unable
to
help
her
for
ah
how
willingly
how
gladly
he
would
have
borne
all
poor
peggy
woes
upon
his
own
broad
shoulders
but
none
the
less
he
had
lost
an
invaluable
opportunity
to
hold
his
tongue
suffer
i
suffer
she
mocked
him
languidly
and
then
like
a
the
tension
snapped
and
she
gave
a
long
angry
gasp
and
her
wrath
flamed
upon
my
word
you
the
most
conceited
man
i
ever
knew
in
my
life
you
think
i
in
love
with
you
with
you
billy
woods
i
would
wipe
my
feet
on
you
if
you
were
the
last
man
left
on
earth
i
hate
you
i
loathe
you
i
detest
you
i
despise
you
do
you
hear
me
i
hate
you
what
do
i
care
if
you
a
snob
and
a
cad
and
a
and
a
forger
and
well
i
do
care
perhaps
you
have
ever
forged
anything
yet
but
i
quite
sure
you
would
if
you
ever
got
an
opportunity
you
be
delighted
to
do
it
yes
you
would
you
just
the
sort
of
man
who
in
crime
i
love
you
why
that
the
best
joke
i
heard
for
a
long
time
i
only
sorry
for
you
billy
woods
because
kathleen
has
thrown
you
over
sorry
do
you
understand
yes
since
you
so
fond
of
skinny
women
i
think
it
a
great
pity
she
would
have
you
do
talk
to
me
she
skinny
i
guess
i
know
she
as
skinny
as
a
beanpole
she
skinnier
than
i
ever
imagined
it
possible
for
anybody
to
be
and
she
pads
and
rouges
till
i
think
it
disgusting
and
not
half
not
of
her
hair
belongs
to
her
and
that
half
is
dyed
but
of
course
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
and
i
sure
i
very
sorry
for
you
even
though
personally
i
care
for
skinny
women
i
hate
and
i
hate
you
too
billy
woods
she
stamped
her
foot
did
margaret
you
must
bear
with
her
for
her
heart
is
breaking
now
and
if
she
has
become
a
termagant
it
is
because
her
shamed
pride
has
driven
her
mad
bear
with
her
then
a
little
longer
billy
tried
to
bear
with
her
for
in
part
he
understood
peggy
said
he
very
gently
you
wrong
yes
i
dare
say
she
snapped
at
him
we
wo
discuss
kathleen
if
you
please
but
you
wrong
about
the
will
i
told
you
the
whole
truth
about
that
but
i
do
blame
you
for
not
believing
me
peggy
ah
no
not
i
there
seems
to
be
a
curse
upon
uncle
fred
money
it
brings
out
the
worst
of
all
of
us
it
has
changed
even
you
peggy
and
not
for
the
better
peggy
you
become
distrustful
you
ah
well
we
wo
discuss
that
now
give
me
the
will
my
dear
and
i
burn
it
before
your
eyes
that
ought
to
show
you
peggy
that
you
wrong
billy
was
very
as
he
ended
for
the
woods
temper
is
a
short
one
but
she
had
an
arrow
left
for
him
give
it
to
you
and
do
you
think
i
trust
you
with
it
billy
woods
peggy
ah
peggy
i
had
deserved
that
be
just
at
least
to
me
poor
billy
begged
of
her
which
was
an
absurd
thing
to
ask
of
an
angry
woman
yes
i
know
what
you
do
with
it
you
take
it
right
off
and
have
it
probated
or
executed
or
whatever
it
is
they
do
to
wills
and
turn
me
straight
out
in
the
gutter
that
just
what
you
to
do
this
very
moment
oh
i
know
billy
woods
i
know
what
a
temper
you
got
and
i
know
you
keeping
quiet
now
simply
because
you
know
that
the
most
exasperating
thing
you
can
possibly
do
i
would
have
such
a
disposition
as
you
got
for
the
world
absolutely
control
over
your
temper
not
a
bit
of
it
billy
woods
oh
i
you
yes
you
made
me
cry
and
i
suppose
you
very
proud
of
yourself
you
proud
do
stand
staring
at
me
like
a
stuck
pig
but
answer
me
when
i
talk
to
you
are
you
of
making
me
cry
are
you
ah
do
talk
to
me
do
talk
to
i
tell
you
i
do
wish
to
hear
a
word
got
to
say
i
you
and
you
sha
have
the
money
that
flat
i
do
want
it
said
billy
i
been
trying
to
tell
you
for
the
last
i
do
want
it
in
god
name
why
ca
you
talk
like
a
sensible
woman
peggy
i
am
afraid
that
woods
too
was
beginning
to
lose
his
temper
that
right
swear
at
me
it
only
needed
that
you
do
want
the
money
and
when
you
say
you
do
you
lying
lying
do
you
understand
you
all
want
my
money
oh
dear
margaret
wailed
and
her
great
voice
was
shaken
to
its
depths
and
its
sobbing
was
the
long
hopeless
sobbing
of
a
violin
as
she
flung
back
her
face
and
clenched
her
little
hands
tight
at
her
sides
why
you
let
me
alone
you
all
after
my
money
you
and
kennaston
and
jukesbury

glad
if

did
billy
beg

billy
beg
sir
beg
and
margaret
flung
back
her
head
again
and
laughed
shrilly
and
held
up
her
hand
before
him
as
one
holds
a
lump
of
sugar
before
a
in
selwoode
i
can
fancy
how
the
eagle
screamed
his
triumph
but
billy
face
was
ashen
before
god
he
said
between
his
teeth
loving
you
as
i
do
i
would
marry
you
now
for
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
the
money
has
ruined
you
ruined
you
peggy
for
a
little
she
stared
at
him
by
and
bye
i
dare
say
it
has
she
said
in
a
strangely
sober
tone
i
been
scolding
like
a
fishwife
i
beg
your
pardon
woods
not
for
what
i
said
because
i
meant
every
of
it
but
i
beg
your
pardon
for
saying
it
do
come
with
me
please
blindly
she
turned
from
him
her
shoulders
had
the
droop
of
an
old
woman
margaret
was
wearied
now
weary
with
the
weariness
of
death
for
a
while
woods
stared
after
the
tired
little
figure
that
trudged
straight
onward
in
the
sunlight
stumbling
as
she
went
then
a
pleached
walk
swallowed
her
and
woods
groaned
oh
peggy
peggy
he
said
in
bottomless
compassion
oh
my
poor
little
peggy
how
changed
you
are
afterward
woods
sank
down
upon
the
bench
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
he
sat
there
for
a
long
time
i
do
believe
he
thought
of
anything
very
clearly
his
mind
was
a
turgid
chaos
of
misery
and
about
him
the
birds
shrilled
and
quavered
and
carolled
till
the
air
was
vibrant
with
their
trilling
one
might
have
thought
they
choired
in
honour
of
the
eagle
triumph
in
mockery
of
poor
billy
then
woods
raised
his
head
with
a
queer
alert
look
surely
he
had
heard
a
voice
the
dearest
of
all
voices
billy
it
wailed
oh
billy
xxv
for
at
the
height
of
this
particularly
mischancy
posture
of
affairs
the
meddlesome
fates
had
elected
to
dispatch
flinks
to
serve
as
our
ex
and
just
as
in
the
comedy
the
police
turn
up
in
the
nick
of
time
to
fetch
tartuffe
to
prison
or
in
the
tragedy
friar
john
manages
to
be
detained
on
his
journey
to
mantua
and
thus
bring
about
that
lamentable
business
in
the
tomb
of
the
capulets
so
flinks
now
happens
inopportunely
to
arrive
upon
our
lesser
stage
faithfully
to
narrate
how
flinks
chanced
to
be
at
selwoode
were
a
task
of
magnitude
that
gentleman
travelled
very
quietly
and
for
the
most
part
he
journeyed
incognito
under
a
variety
of
aliases
suggested
partly
by
a
fertile
imagination
and
in
part
by
prudential
motives
for
his
notions
of
proprietary
rights
were
deplorably
vague
and
his
acquaintance
with
the
police
in
consequence
extensive
and
finally
that
he
was
now
at
selwoode
was
not
in
the
least
his
fault
but
all
the
doing
of
an
brakesman
who
had
in
uncultured
argument
reinforced
by
a
persuaded
flinks
to
disembark
from
the
northern
freight
on
the
night
previous
flinks
then
sat
leaning
against
a
tree
in
the
gardens
of
selwoode
some
thirty
feet
from
the
wall
that
stands
between
selwoode
and
gridlington
and
nursed
his
pride
and
foot
both
injured
in
that
high
debate
of
last
evening
and
with
a
jackknife
rounded
off
the
top
of
a
substantial
staff
designed
to
alleviate
his
present
lameness
meanwhile
he
tempered
his
solitude
with
music
whistling
melodiously
the
air
of
a
song
that
pertained
to
the
sacredness
of
home
and
of
a
mother
subsequently
to
flinks
as
the
playbill
has
it
enter
a
vision
in
violet
ruffles
she
came
upon
him
in
her
misery
steadily
trudging
toward
an
unknown
goal
i
think
he
startled
her
a
bit
indeed
it
must
be
admitted
that
flinks
while
a
man
of
undoubted
talent
in
his
particular
line
of
business
was
like
many
of
your
great
geniuses
in
outward
aspect
unprepossessing
and
misleading
for
whereas
he
looked
like
a
very
shiftless
and
very
dirty
tramp
he
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
vile
a
rascal
as
ever
pawned
a
swinish
soul
for
whiskey
what
are
you
doing
here
said
margaret
sharply
do
you
know
this
is
private
property
to
his
feet
rose
flinks
lady
said
he
with
humbleness
you
would
be
hard
on
a
poor
workingman
would
you
it
ai
my
fault
i
here
lady
at
least
it
ai
rightly
my
fault
i
just
climbed
over
the
wall
to
rest
a
minute
just
a
minute
lady
in
the
shade
of
these
beautiful
trees
i
ai
nobody
by
that
lady
i
hope
well
you
had
no
business
to
do
it
miss
hugonin
pointed
out
and
you
can
just
climb
right
back
then
she
regarded
him
more
intently
and
her
face
softened
somewhat
what
the
matter
with
your
foot
she
demanded
brakesman
said
flinks
briefly
threw
me
off
a
train
he
struck
me
cruel
hard
he
did
and
me
a
poor
workingman
trying
to
make
my
way
to
new
york
lady
where
my
poor
old
mother
dying
lady
and
me
out
of
a
job
ah
it
a
hard
hard
world
lady
and
me
her
only
son
and
he
struck
me
cruel
cruel
hard
he
did
but
i
forgive
him
for
it
lady
ah
lady
you
so
beautiful
i
know
you
got
a
kind
good
heart
lady
ca
you
do
something
for
a
poor
workingman
lady
with
a
poor
dying
mother
and
a
poor
sick
wife
flinks
added
as
a
dolorous
afterthought
and
drew
nearer
to
her
and
held
out
one
hand
appealingly
petheridge
jukesbury
had
at
divers
times
pointed
out
to
her
the
evils
of
promiscuous
charity
and
these
dicta
margaret
parroted
glibly
enough
to
do
her
justice
so
long
as
there
was
no
immediate
question
of
dispensing
alms
but
for
all
that
the
next
whining
beggar
would
move
her
tender
heart
his
glib
inventions
playing
upon
it
like
a
fiddle
and
she
would
give
as
recklessly
as
though
there
were
no
such
things
in
the
whole
wide
world
as
and
organised
charities
and
because
you
know
she
would
afterward
salve
her
conscience
i
be
sure
he
did
need
it
whereas
i
was
sure
i
did
now
she
wavered
for
a
moment
you
did
say
you
had
a
wife
before
she
suggested
an
invalid
sighed
flinks
a
helpless
invalid
lady
and
six
small
children
probably
crying
for
bread
at
this
very
moment
ah
lady
think
what
my
feelings
must
be
to
hear
cry
in
vain
think
what
i
must
suffer
to
know
that
i
summoned
them
cherubs
out
of
heaven
into
this
here
hard
hard
world
lady
and
now
ca
do
by
properly
and
flinks
brushed
away
a
tear
which
i
for
one
am
inclined
to
regard
as
a
particularly
ambitious
flight
of
his
imagination
promptly
margaret
opened
the
bag
at
her
waist
and
took
out
her
purse
do
she
pleaded
please
do
i
i
upset
already
take
this
and
please
oh
do
spend
it
in
getting
drunk
or
gambling
or
anything
horrid
miss
hugonin
implored
him
you
all
do
and
so
selfish
of
you
and
so
discouraging
flinks
eyed
the
purse
hungrily
such
a
fat
purse
thought
plinks
and
there
ai
nobody
within
a
mile
of
here
neither
you
are
not
to
imagine
that
flinks
was
totally
abandoned
his
vices
were
parochial
restrained
for
the
most
part
by
a
lively
apprehension
of
the
law
but
now
the
spell
of
the
eagle
was
strong
upon
him
lady
said
flinks
twisting
in
his
grimy
hand
the
bill
she
had
given
him
and
there
too
the
eagle
flaunted
in
his
vigour
and
heartened
him
lady
that
ai
much
for
you
to
give
ca
you
do
a
little
better
than
that
by
a
poor
workingman
lady
a
very
person
flinks
oh
a
peculiarly
person
to
be
a
model
son
and
a
loving
husband
and
a
tender
father
margaret
was
filled
with
a
vague
alarm
but
she
was
brave
was
margaret
no
said
she
very
decidedly
i
sha
give
you
another
cent
so
you
climb
right
over
that
wall
and
go
straight
back
where
you
belong
the
methods
of
flinks
i
regret
to
say
were
somewhat
more
crude
than
those
of
mesdames
haggage
and
saumarez
and
messieurs
kennaston
and
jukesbury
cheese
it
said
flinks
and
flung
away
his
staff
and
drew
very
near
to
her
gim
me
that
money
do
you
hear
do
you
dare
touch
me
she
panted
ah
do
you
aw
hell
said
flinks
disgustedly
and
his
dirty
hands
were
upon
her
and
his
foul
breath
reeked
in
her
face
in
her
hour
of
need
margaret
heart
spoke
billy
she
wailed
oh
billy
he
came
to
her
just
as
he
would
have
scaled
heaven
to
come
to
her
just
as
he
would
have
come
to
her
in
the
nethermost
pit
of
hell
if
she
had
called
ah
yes
billy
woods
came
to
her
now
in
her
peril
and
i
do
think
that
flinks
particularly
relished
the
look
upon
billy
face
as
he
ran
through
the
gardens
for
billy
was
furiously
moved
flinks
glanced
back
at
the
wall
behind
him
ten
feet
high
and
the
fellow
ai
far
off
flinks
caught
up
his
staff
and
as
billy
closed
upon
him
struck
him
full
on
the
head
again
and
again
he
struck
him
it
was
a
sickening
business
billy
had
stopped
short
for
an
instant
he
stood
swaying
on
his
feet
a
puzzled
face
showing
under
the
trickling
blood
then
he
flung
out
his
hands
a
little
and
they
flapped
loosely
at
the
wrists
like
wet
clothes
hung
in
the
wind
to
dry
and
billy
seemed
to
crumple
up
suddenly
and
slid
down
upon
the
grass
in
an
untidy
heap
said
flinks
he
drew
back
and
stared
stupidly
at
that
sprawling
flesh
which
just
now
had
been
a
man
and
was
seized
with
uncontrollable
shuddering
said
flinks
very
quietly
and
margaret
went
mad
the
earth
and
the
sky
dissolved
in
many
floating
specks
and
then
went
red
red
like
that
heap
yonder
the
veneer
of
civilisation
peeled
fell
from
her
like
snow
from
a
shaken
garment
the
primal
beast
woke
and
flicked
aside
the
centuries
work
she
was
the
who
had
seen
the
death
of
her
mate
the
brute
who
had
been
robbed
of
her
mate
damn
you
you
she
screamed
her
voice
high
flat
quite
unhuman
ah
god
in
heaven
damn
you
with
inarticulate
bestial
cries
she
fell
upon
the
man
who
had
killed
billy
and
her
violet
fripperies
fluttered
her
impotent
little
hands
beat
at
him
tore
at
him
she
was
fearless
shameless
insane
she
only
knew
that
billy
was
dead
with
an
oath
the
man
flung
her
from
him
and
turned
on
his
heel
she
fell
to
coaxing
the
heap
in
the
grass
to
tell
her
that
he
forgave
her
to
open
his
eyes
to
stop
bloodying
her
dress
to
come
to
luncheon
a
fly
settled
on
billy
face
and
came
in
his
course
to
the
red
stream
trickling
from
his
nostrils
and
stopped
short
she
brushed
the
carrion
thing
away
but
it
crawled
back
drunkenly
she
touched
it
with
her
finger
and
the
fly
would
not
move
on
a
sudden
every
nerve
in
her
body
began
to
shake
and
jerk
like
a
flag
snapping
in
the
wind
xxvi
some
ten
minutes
afterward
as
the
members
of
the
sat
chatting
on
the
terrace
before
selwoode
there
came
among
them
a
mad
woman
in
violet
trappings
that
were
splotched
with
blood
did
you
know
that
billy
was
dead
she
queried
smilingly
oh
yes
a
man
killed
billy
just
now
was
it
too
bad
billy
was
such
a
nice
boy
you
know
i
i
think
it
very
sad
i
think
it
the
saddest
thing
i
ever
knew
of
in
my
life
kathleen
saumarez
was
the
first
to
reach
her
but
she
drew
back
quickly
no
ah
no
she
said
with
a
little
shudder
you
did
love
billy
he
loved
you
and
you
did
love
him
oh
kathleen
kathleen
how
you
help
loving
billy
he
was
such
a
nice
boy
i
i
rather
sorry
he
dead
then
she
stood
silent
picking
at
her
dress
thoughtfully
and
still
smiling
afterward
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
history
miss
hugonin
fainted
fainted
with
an
anxious
smile
petheridge
jukesbury
caught
her
as
she
fell
and
began
to
blubber
like
a
whipped
schoolboy
as
he
stood
there
holding
her
in
his
arms
xxvii
but
billy
was
not
dead
there
was
still
a
feeble
jerky
fluttering
in
his
big
chest
when
colonel
hugonin
found
him
his
heart
still
moved
but
under
the
colonel
hand
its
stirrings
were
vague
and
aimless
as
those
of
a
captive
butterfly
the
colonel
had
seen
dead
men
and
dying
men
before
this
and
as
he
bent
over
the
boy
he
loved
he
gave
a
convulsive
sob
and
afterward
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
then
of
all
unlikely
persons
in
the
world
it
was
petheridge
jukesbury
who
rose
to
meet
the
occasion
his
suavity
and
blandness
forgotten
in
the
presence
of
death
he
mounted
with
confident
alacrity
to
heights
of
greatness
masterfully
he
overrode
them
all
he
poured
brandy
between
billy
teeth
then
he
ordered
the
ladies
off
to
bed
and
recommended
to
kennaston
when
that
gentleman
spoke
of
a
clergyman
a
far
more
startling
destination
for
it
is
far
from
my
intention
said
jukesbury
to
appear
lacking
in
respect
to
the
cloth
but
er
just
at
present
i
am
inclined
to
think
we
are
in
somewhat
greater
need
of
a
mattress
and
a
doctor
and
ah
the
exercise
of
a
little
the
gentleman
is
er
let
us
hope
in
no
immediate
danger
how
dare
you
suggest
such
a
thing
sir
thundered
petheridge
jukesbury
did
you
see
that
poor
girl
face
i
tell
you
i
be
damned
if
he
dies
sir
and
i
fancy
the
recording
angel
heard
him
and
against
a
list
of
wordy
cheats
registered
that
oath
to
his
credit
it
was
petheridge
jukesbury
then
who
stalked
into
apartments
and
appropriated
her
mattress
as
the
first
at
hand
and
afterward
waddled
through
the
gardens
bearing
it
on
his
fat
shoulders
and
still
later
lifted
billy
upon
it
as
gently
as
a
woman
could
have
but
it
was
the
hatless
colonel
on
his
favourite
black
bess
damn
your
the
colonel
was
wont
to
say
i
consider
my
appearance
sufficiently
unprepossessing
already
sir
without
my
arriving
in
heaven
in
fragments
and
stinking
of
gasoline
who
in
fairhaven
town
some
quarter
of
an
hour
afterward
leaped
jeal
garden
fence
and
subsequently
bundled
the
doctor
into
his
gig
and
again
yet
later
it
was
the
colonel
who
stood
fuming
upon
the
terrace
with
jeal
on
his
way
to
selwoode
indeed
but
still
some
four
miles
from
the
mansion
toward
which
he
was
urging
his
staid
horse
at
its
liveliest
gait
kennaston
tried
to
soothe
him
but
the
colonel
clamoured
to
the
heavens
kennaston
he
qualified
in
various
ways
and
as
for
jeal
he
would
hold
him
responsible
personally
sir
for
the
consequences
of
his
dawdling
in
this
fashion
damme
sir
like
a
damn
snail
with
a
wooden
leg
i
am
afraid
said
kennaston
gravely
that
the
doctor
will
be
of
very
little
use
when
he
does
arrive
there
was
that
in
his
face
which
made
the
colonel
pause
in
his
objurgations
sir
said
the
colonel
what
do
you
mean
he
found
articulation
somewhat
difficult
in
your
absence
kennaston
answered
jukesbury
who
it
appears
knows
something
of
medicine
has
subjected
woods
to
an
examination
it
it
would
be
unkind
to
deceive
you
come
to
the
point
sir
the
colonel
interrupted
him
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
said
felix
kennaston
sadly
that
he
is
afraid
woods
will
never
recover
consciousness
colonel
hugonin
stared
at
him
the
skin
of
his
flabby
wrinkled
old
throat
was
working
convulsively
then
you
wrong
sir
the
colonel
said
billy
die
damn
jukesbury
damn
all
doctors
too
sir
i
put
my
trust
in
my
god
sir
and
not
in
a
box
of
damn
sir
and
i
tell
you
sir
boy
is
not
going
to
afterward
he
turned
and
went
into
selwoode
defiantly
xxviii
in
the
the
colonel
found
margaret
white
as
paper
with
purple
lips
that
timidly
smiled
at
him
why
ai
you
in
bed
the
old
gentleman
demanded
with
as
great
an
affectation
of
sternness
as
he
could
muster
to
say
the
truth
it
was
not
much
for
colonel
hugonin
for
all
his
blustering
optimism
was
sadly
shaken
now
attractive
said
margaret
i
was
but
i
could
stay
there
my
my
brain
wo
stop
working
you
see
she
complained
wearily
a
thin
little
whisper
in
the
back
of
it
that
keeps
telling
me
about
billy
and
what
a
liar
he
is
and
what
nice
eyes
he
has
and
how
poor
billy
is
dead
it
keeps
telling
me
that
over
and
over
again
attractive
it
such
a
tiresome
silly
little
whisper
but
he
is
dead
is
he
did
kennaston
tell
me
just
now
that
he
was
dead
or
was
it
the
whisper
attractive
the
colonel
coughed
kennaston
er
kennaston
a
fool
he
declared
helplessly
always
said
he
was
a
fool
we
have
jeal
in
presently
no
i
remember
now
kennaston
said
billy
would
die
very
soon
you
do
like
people
to
disagree
with
you
do
you
attractive
of
course
he
will
die
for
the
man
hit
him
very
hard
i
sorry
billy
is
going
to
die
though
even
if
he
is
such
a
liar
do
said
the
colonel
hoarsely
do
daughter
i
do
know
what
there
is
between
you
and
billy
but
you
wrong
oh
you
very
hopelessly
wrong
billy
the
finest
boy
i
know
margaret
shook
her
head
in
dissent
no
he
a
very
contemptible
liar
she
said
disinterestedly
and
that
is
what
makes
it
so
queer
that
i
should
care
for
him
more
than
i
do
for
anything
else
in
the
world
yes
it
very
queer
then
margaret
went
into
the
room
opening
into
the
where
billy
woods
lay
unconscious
pallid
breathing
stertorously
and
the
colonel
stared
after
her
oh
my
god
my
god
groaned
the
poor
colonel
why
could
it
have
been
i
why
could
it
have
been
i
that
ai
wanted
any
longer
she
never
have
grieved
like
that
for
me
and
indeed
i
do
think
she
would
have
for
to
margaret
there
had
come
as
god
willing
there
comes
to
every
woman
the
time
to
put
away
all
childish
things
and
all
childish
memories
and
all
childish
ties
if
need
be
to
follow
one
man
only
and
cleave
to
him
and
know
his
life
and
hers
to
be
knit
up
together
past
severance
in
a
love
that
death
itself
may
not
affright
nor
slay
xxix
she
sat
silent
in
one
corner
of
the
darkened
room
it
was
the
bedroom
that
frederick
woods
formerly
occupied
on
the
ground
floor
of
selwoode
opening
into
the
to
which
they
had
carried
billy
jukesbury
had
done
what
he
could
in
the
bed
lay
billy
woods
swathed
in
hot
blankets
with
bottles
of
hot
water
set
to
his
feet
jukesbury
had
washed
his
face
clean
of
that
awful
red
and
had
wrapped
bandages
of
cracked
ice
about
his
head
and
propped
it
high
with
pillows
it
was
little
short
of
marvellous
to
see
the
pursy
old
hypocrite
going
about
the
room
on
his
stealthy
ministrations
replenishing
the
bandages
forcing
spirits
of
ammonia
between
billy
teeth
fighting
deftly
and
confidently
with
death
billy
still
breathed
the
colonel
came
and
went
uneasily
the
clock
on
the
mantel
ticked
margaret
brooded
in
a
silence
that
was
only
accentuated
by
that
horrible
wheezing
gurgling
tremulous
breathing
in
the
bed
yonder
would
the
doctor
never
come
she
was
curiously
conscious
of
her
absolute
lack
of
emotion
but
always
the
interminable
thin
whispering
in
the
back
of
her
head
went
on
and
on
oh
if
he
had
only
died
four
years
ago
oh
if
he
had
only
died
the
dear
honest
boy
i
used
to
know
when
that
noise
stops
he
will
be
dead
and
then
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
cry
oh
if
he
had
only
died
four
years
ago
and
then
on
and
on
ran
the
interminable
thin
whispering
as
margaret
waited
for
death
to
come
to
billy
billy
looked
so
old
now
under
his
many
bandages
surely
he
must
be
very
very
near
death
suddenly
as
jukesbury
wrapped
new
bandages
about
his
forehead
billy
opened
his
eyes
and
without
further
movement
smiled
placidly
up
at
him
hello
jukesbury
said
billy
woods
where
my
armour
jukesbury
too
smiled
the
man
is
bringing
it
downstairs
now
he
answered
quietly
because
billy
went
on
fretfully
i
do
propose
to
miss
the
trojan
war
the
princes
orgulous
with
high
blood
chafed
you
know
are
all
going
to
be
there
and
i
do
propose
to
miss
it
behind
his
fat
back
petheridge
jukesbury
waved
a
cautioning
hand
at
margaret
who
had
risen
from
her
chair
but
it
is
very
absurd
billy
murmured
in
the
mere
ghost
of
a
voice
because
men
do
propose
by
mistake
except
in
farces
somebody
told
me
that
but
i
ca
remember
who
because
i
am
a
misogynist
that
is
a
greek
word
and
i
would
explain
it
to
peggy
if
she
would
only
give
me
a
chance
but
she
ca
because
she
has
those
seventeen
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
children
to
look
after
there
must
be
some
way
to
explain
to
her
though
because
where
there
a
will
there
is
always
a
way
and
there
were
three
wills
uncle
fred
should
not
have
left
so
many
wills
who
would
have
thought
the
old
man
had
so
much
ink
in
him
but
i
will
be
a
very
great
painter
uncle
fred
and
make
her
sorry
for
the
way
she
has
treated
me
and
kathleen
will
understand
i
was
talking
about
peggy
his
voice
died
away
and
margaret
sat
with
wide
eyes
listening
for
it
again
would
the
doctor
never
come
billy
was
smiling
and
picking
at
the
sheets
but
peggy
is
so
rich
the
faint
voice
presently
complained
so
beastly
rich
there
is
gold
in
her
hair
and
if
you
will
look
very
closely
you
will
see
that
her
lashes
were
pure
gold
until
she
dipped
them
in
the
besides
she
expects
me
to
sit
up
and
beg
for
lumps
of
sugar
and
i
take
sugar
in
my
coffee
and
peggy
does
drink
coffee
at
all
so
i
think
it
is
very
unfair
especially
as
teddy
anstruther
drinks
like
a
fish
and
she
is
going
to
marry
him
peggy
why
wo
you
marry
me
you
know
i
always
loved
you
peggy
and
now
i
can
tell
you
so
because
uncle
fred
has
left
me
all
his
money
you
think
a
great
deal
about
money
peggy
you
said
it
was
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
and
it
must
be
because
it
is
the
only
thing
the
thing
peggy
that
has
been
strong
enough
to
keep
us
apart
a
part
is
never
greater
than
the
whole
peggy
but
i
will
explain
about
that
when
you
open
that
desk
there
are
sharks
in
it
are
there
peggy
there
his
voice
had
risen
to
a
querulous
tone
gently
the
fat
old
man
restrained
him
yes
said
petheridge
jukesbury
dear
me
yes
why
dear
me
of
course
but
his
warning
hand
held
margaret
back
margaret
who
stood
with
big
tears
trickling
down
her
cheeks
dearer
than
life
itself
billy
assented
wearily
but
before
god
loving
you
as
i
do
i
would
marry
you
now
for
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
i
forget
why
but
all
the
world
is
a
stage
you
know
and
they
do
use
stages
now
but
only
railroads
is
that
why
you
rail
at
me
so
peggy
that
is
a
joke
you
ought
to
laugh
at
my
jokes
because
i
love
you
but
i
ca
ever
ever
tell
you
so
because
you
are
rich
a
rich
man
can
not
pass
through
a
needle
eye
oh
peggy
peggy
i
love
your
eyes
but
they
so
peggy
so
billy
woods
lay
still
and
babbled
ceaselessly
but
through
all
his
irrelevant
talk
as
you
may
see
a
tributary
stream
pulse
unsullied
in
a
muddied
river
ran
the
thought
of
peggy
of
peggy
and
of
her
cruelty
and
of
her
beauty
and
of
the
money
that
stood
between
them
and
margaret
who
could
never
have
believed
him
in
his
senses
listened
and
knew
that
in
his
delirium
the
rudder
of
his
thoughts
snapped
he
could
not
but
speak
truth
as
she
crouched
in
the
corner
of
the
room
her
face
buried
in
an
her
gold
hair
half
loosened
her
shoulders
monotonously
heaving
she
wept
gently
inaudibly
almost
happily
almost
happily
billy
was
dying
but
she
knew
now
past
any
doubting
that
he
loved
her
the
dear
honest
boy
had
come
back
to
her
and
she
could
love
him
now
without
shame
and
there
was
only
herself
to
be
loathed
illustration
regarded
them
with
alert
eyes
then
the
door
opened
then
with
colonel
hugonin
came
martin
jeal
a
wisp
of
a
man
like
a
november
leaf
and
regarded
them
from
under
his
shaggy
white
hair
with
alert
eyes
hey
what
this
said
jeal
eh
yes
eh
yes
he
meditated
slowly
most
irregular
you
must
let
us
have
the
room
miss
hugonin
in
the
hall
she
waited
hope
ah
of
course
there
was
no
hope
the
thin
little
whisper
told
her
by
and
bye
though
after
centuries
of
waiting
the
three
men
came
into
the
hall
miss
hugonin
said
jeal
with
a
strange
kindness
in
his
voice
i
do
think
we
shall
need
you
again
i
am
happy
to
tell
you
though
that
the
patient
is
doing
nicely
very
nicely
indeed
margaret
clutched
his
arm
you
you
mean
i
mean
said
jeal
that
there
is
no
fracture
a
slight
concussion
of
the
brain
madam
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
no
signs
of
inflammation
barring
accidents
i
think
we
have
that
young
man
out
of
bed
in
a
week
thanks
he
added
to
er
jukesbury
here
whose
prompt
action
was
under
heaven
undoubtedly
the
means
of
staving
off
meningitis
and
probably
indeed
more
than
probably
the
means
of
saving
woods
life
it
was
splendid
sir
splendid
no
doctor
why
god
bless
my
soul
for
miss
hugonin
had
thrown
her
arms
about
petheridge
jukesbury
neck
and
had
kissed
him
vigorously
you
beautiful
child
said
miss
hugonin
er
jukesbury
said
the
colonel
mysteriously
there
a
little
cognac
in
the
cellar
that
er
the
colonel
jerked
his
thumb
across
the
hallway
with
the
air
of
a
conspirator
eh
said
the
colonel
why
er
yes
said
jukesbury
why
ah
yes
i
think
i
might
they
went
across
the
hall
together
the
colonel
hand
rested
fraternally
on
petheridge
jukesbury
shoulder
xxx
the
next
day
there
was
a
general
exodus
from
selwoode
and
satellites
dispersed
upon
their
divers
ways
selwoode
as
they
understood
it
was
no
longer
hers
and
they
knew
billy
woods
well
enough
to
recognise
that
from
selwoode
new
master
there
were
no
desirable
pickings
to
be
had
such
as
the
philanthropic
crew
had
fattened
on
these
four
years
past
so
there
came
to
them
one
and
all
urgent
telegrams
or
insistent
letters
or
some
equally
unanswerable
demand
for
their
presence
elsewhere
such
as
are
usually
prevalent
among
our
guests
in
very
dull
or
very
troublous
times
miss
hugonin
smiled
a
little
bitterly
she
considered
that
the
scales
had
fallen
from
her
eyes
and
flattered
herself
that
she
was
by
way
of
becoming
a
bit
of
a
misanthrope
also
i
believe
there
was
a
note
concerning
the
hollowness
of
life
and
the
worthlessness
of
society
in
general
in
a
word
margaret
fell
back
upon
the
extreme
cynicism
and
of
and
assured
herself
that
she
despised
everybody
whereas
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
never
in
her
life
succeeded
in
disliking
anything
except
mice
and
and
for
a
very
little
while
billy
woods
and
this
for
the
very
excellent
reason
that
the
gods
had
fashioned
her
solely
to
the
end
that
she
might
love
all
mankind
and
in
return
be
loved
by
humanity
in
general
and
adored
by
that
portion
of
it
which
inhabits
trousers
but
the
rats
always
desert
a
sinking
ship
said
miss
hugonin
with
the
air
of
one
delivering
a
particularly
original
sentiment
they
make
me
awfully
tired
and
i
do
care
for
them
in
the
least
but
petheridge
jukesbury
is
a
and
i
may
be
poor
now
but
i
try
to
do
good
with
the
money
when
i
had
it
and
billy
is
going
to
get
well
and
after
all
that
was
the
one
thing
that
really
mattered
though
of
course
billy
would
always
despise
her
he
would
be
quite
right
too
the
girl
thought
humbly
but
the
conventionalities
of
life
are
more
powerful
than
even
youthful
cynicism
and
youthful
prior
to
devoting
herself
to
a
loveless
life
and
the
commonplaces
of
the
stoic
tub
miss
hugonin
was
compelled
by
the
barest
decency
to
bid
her
guests
godspeed
and
adèle
haggage
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
been
a
little
awed
by
miss
hugonin
the
famous
heiress
a
little
jealous
of
her
i
dare
say
on
account
of
hugh
van
orden
but
now
she
kissed
her
very
heartily
in
farewell
and
said
do
forget
you
are
to
come
to
us
as
soon
as
and
was
beyond
any
question
perfectly
sincere
in
saying
it
and
hugh
van
orden
almost
dragged
margaret
under
the
main
stairway
and
far
from
showing
any
marked
abhorrence
to
her
in
her
present
state
of
destitution
implored
her
with
tears
in
his
eyes
to
marry
him
at
once
and
to
bring
the
colonel
to
live
with
them
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
existence
for
it
damned
impertinent
of
me
of
course
van
orden
readily
conceded
and
i
suppose
i
ought
to
beg
your
pardon
for
mentioning
it
but
i
love
you
to
a
perfectly
unlimited
extent
it
playing
the
very
deuce
with
my
polo
miss
hugonin
and
as
for
my
appetite
why
if
you
wo
have
me
cried
hugh
in
desperation
i
i
really
you
know
i
do
believe
i
be
able
to
eat
anything
when
margaret
refused
him
for
the
sixth
time
i
think
i
wo
swear
that
she
did
kiss
him
under
the
dark
stairway
and
if
she
did
he
was
a
nice
boy
and
he
deserved
it
and
as
for
sarah
ellen
haggage
that
unreverend
old
parasite
brought
her
a
blank
cheque
signed
with
her
name
and
mentioned
quite
a
goodly
sum
as
the
extent
to
which
margaret
might
go
for
necessary
expenses
for
you
need
it
she
said
and
rubbed
her
nose
reflectively
moving
is
the
very
deuce
for
wasting
money
because
so
many
little
things
keep
cropping
up
now
remember
a
quarter
is
quite
enough
to
give
man
for
moving
a
trunk
and
there
no
earthly
sense
in
your
taking
a
cab
margaret
the
will
bring
you
within
a
block
of
our
door
these
little
trifles
count
dear
and
do
let
célestine
pack
your
things
because
she
abominably
careless
let
marie
do
it
and
do
tip
her
give
her
an
old
hat
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
certainly
consult
a
lawyer
about
the
legality
of
that
idiotic
will
i
remember
distinctly
hearing
that
woods
was
very
eccentric
in
his
last
days
and
i
have
a
doubt
he
was
raving
mad
when
he
left
all
his
money
to
a
great
strapping
young
fellow
who
is
perfectly
capable
of
taking
care
of
himself
getting
better
is
he
well
i
suppose
i
glad
to
hear
it
but
he
much
better
have
stayed
in
paris
where
i
remember
distinctly
hearing
he
led
the
most
dissipated
and
immoral
life
my
dear
instead
of
coming
over
here
and
upsetting
everything
and
again
haggage
rubbed
her
nose
indignantly
he
said
margaret
and
i
take
your
money
beautiful
and
i
do
see
how
we
can
possibly
come
to
stay
with
you
do
you
argue
with
me
haggage
exhorted
her
i
not
in
any
temper
to
be
argued
with
i
spent
the
morning
sewing
bias
stripes
in
a
bias
skirt
something
which
from
a
and
standpoint
simply
knocks
the
spots
off
job
you
take
that
money
and
you
come
to
me
as
soon
as
you
can
and
god
bless
you
my
dear
and
again
margaret
was
kissed
altogether
it
was
a
very
osculatory
morning
for
miss
hugonin
jukesbury
adieus
however
were
more
formal
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
the
old
fellow
went
away
wondering
if
the
rich
woods
might
not
conceivably
be
very
grateful
to
the
man
who
had
saved
his
life
and
evince
his
gratitude
in
some
agreeable
and
substantial
form
saumarez
and
kennaston
also
were
somewhat
unenthusiastic
in
their
parting
kennaston
could
not
feel
quite
at
ease
with
margaret
brazen
it
as
he
might
with
flippancy
and
kathleen
had
by
this
an
inkling
as
to
how
matters
stood
between
margaret
and
billy
and
was
somewhat
puzzled
thereat
and
loved
the
former
in
consequence
no
more
than
any
christian
female
is
compelled
to
love
the
woman
who
either
unconsciously
or
with
deliberation
purloins
her
ancient
lover
a
woman
rarely
forgives
the
man
who
has
ceased
to
care
for
her
and
rarelier
still
can
she
pardon
the
woman
who
has
dared
succeed
her
in
his
affections
and
besides
they
were
utterly
engrossed
with
one
another
and
utterly
happy
and
utterly
selfish
with
the
immemorial
selfishness
of
lovers
who
can
not
for
a
moment
conceive
that
the
whole
world
is
not
somehow
benefited
by
their
happiness
and
does
not
await
with
breathless
interest
the
outcome
of
their
bickerings
with
the
blind
and
from
this
providential
delusion
derive
a
meritorious
and
comfortable
glow
so
saumarez
and
kennaston
parted
from
margaret
with
kindness
it
is
true
but
not
without
awkwardness
and
that
was
the
man
that
almost
she
had
loved
thought
margaret
as
she
gazed
on
the
whirl
of
dust
left
by
their
gone
with
a
few
perfunctory
words
of
sympathy
and
for
my
part
i
think
that
the
base
indian
who
threw
a
pearl
away
worth
more
than
all
his
tribe
was
in
comparison
with
felix
kennaston
a
shrewd
and
man
if
you
had
given
his
chances
margaret
but
this
however
is
highly
digressive
the
colonel
standing
beside
her
used
language
that
was
unrefined
his
aspirations
as
to
the
future
of
kennaston
and
jukesbury
it
appeared
were
both
lurid
and
unfriendly
but
why
attractive
queried
his
daughter
may
they
be
qualified
with
such
and
such
adjectives
desired
the
colonel
fervently
they
tried
to
lend
me
money
would
hear
of
my
not
taking
it
in
case
of
necessity
bah
said
the
colonel
and
shook
his
fist
after
the
retreating
carriages
may
they
be
qualified
with
such
and
such
adjectives
how
happily
she
laughed
and
you
swearing
at
them
she
pouted
oh
my
dear
my
dear
how
hard
you
are
on
all
my
little
friends
of
course
i
am
said
the
colonel
stoutly
they
deprived
me
of
the
pleasure
of
despising
it
was
worth
double
the
money
i
tell
you
i
never
objected
to
any
men
quite
so
much
and
now
they
gone
and
behaved
decently
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
annoying
me
oh
cried
the
colonel
and
shook
an
immaculate
withered
old
hand
toward
the
spring
sky
may
they
be
qualified
with
such
and
such
adjectives
and
that
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
was
the
end
of
satellites
my
dear
grundy
may
one
point
the
somewhat
obvious
moral
i
thank
you
madam
for
your
kindness
permit
me
then
to
vault
toward
my
moral
over
the
shoulders
of
a
greater
man
among
the
papers
left
by
one
charles
dickens
a
novelist
who
is
obsolete
now
because
he
wallows
naked
in
the
pathetic
and
was
frequently
guilty
of
a
very
vulgar
sort
of
humour
that
actually
made
people
laugh
which
as
we
now
know
is
not
the
purpose
of
humour
a
novelist
who
incessantly
caricatured
nature
and
by
these
inartistic
and
underhand
methods
created
characters
that
are
more
real
to
us
than
the
folk
we
jostle
in
the
street
and
god
knows
far
more
vital
and
worthy
of
attention
than
the
folk
who
can
not
read
dickens
you
will
find
i
say
a
note
of
an
idea
which
he
never
afterward
developed
running
to
this
effect
full
length
portrait
of
his
lordship
surrounded
by
worshippers
sensible
men
enough
agreeable
men
enough
independent
men
enough
in
a
certain
way
but
the
moment
they
begin
to
circle
round
my
lord
and
to
shine
with
a
borrowed
light
from
his
lordship
heaven
and
earth
how
mean
and
subservient
what
a
competition
and
outbidding
of
each
other
in
servility
and
this
with
my
lord
and
his
lordship
erased
to
make
way
for
the
word
money
is
my
moral
the
folk
who
have
just
left
selwoode
were
honest
enough
as
honesty
goes
nowadays
kindly
as
any
of
us
dare
be
who
have
our
own
way
to
make
among
very
stalwart
and
determined
rivals
generous
as
any
man
may
venture
to
be
in
a
world
where
the
first
of
every
month
finds
the
butcher
and
the
baker
and
the
rapping
at
the
door
with
their
little
bills
but
they
cringed
to
money
it
was
very
wrong
of
them
my
dear
lady
and
in
extenuation
i
can
only
plead
that
they
could
no
more
help
cringing
to
money
than
you
or
i
can
help
it
this
is
very
crude
and
very
cynical
but
unfortunately
it
is
true
we
always
cringe
to
money
which
is
humiliating
and
the
sun
always
rises
at
an
hour
when
sensible
people
are
abed
and
have
not
the
least
need
for
its
services
which
is
foolish
and
what
you
and
i
my
dear
madam
are
to
do
about
rectifying
either
one
of
these
vexatious
circumstances
i
am
sure
i
do
know
we
can
at
least
be
honest
let
us
then
console
ourselves
at
will
with
moral
observations
concerning
the
number
of
pockets
in
a
shroud
and
the
difficulty
of
a
rich
man
entering
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
with
an
humble
and
reverent
heart
let
us
admit
that
in
the
world
we
know
money
rules
its
presence
awes
us
and
if
we
are
quite
candid
we
must
concede
that
we
very
unfeignedly
envy
and
admire
the
rich
we
must
grant
that
money
confers
a
certain
distinction
on
a
man
be
he
the
veriest
ass
that
ever
heehawed
a
platitude
and
that
we
can
not
but
treat
him
accordingly
you
and
i
you
are
friendly
of
course
with
your
poor
cousins
you
are
delighted
to
have
them
drop
in
to
dinner
and
liberal
enough
with
the
claret
when
they
do
but
when
the
magnate
comes
there
is
a
magnum
of
champagne
and
an
extra
lamp
in
the
and
i
blush
to
write
it
a
far
more
agreeable
hostess
at
the
head
of
the
table
dives
is
such
good
company
you
see
and
speaking
for
my
own
sex
i
defy
any
honest
fellow
to
lay
his
hand
upon
his
waistcoat
and
swear
that
it
does
give
him
a
distinct
thrill
of
pleasure
to
be
seen
in
public
with
a
millionaire
daily
we
truckle
in
the
eagle
shadow
the
shadow
that
lay
so
heavily
across
selwoode
with
the
eagle
himself
and
with
the
eagle
work
in
the
world
the
grim
implacable
ruthless
work
that
hourly
he
goes
about
our
little
comedy
has
naught
to
do
we
deal
but
in
shadows
even
the
shadow
of
the
eagle
is
a
terrible
thing
a
shadow
that
as
felix
kennaston
has
told
you
chills
faith
and
charity
and
independence
and
kindliness
and
truth
and
alas
even
common
honesty
but
this
is
both
cynical
and
digressive
xxxi
jeal
better
than
his
word
had
billy
woods
out
of
bed
in
five
days
to
billy
they
were
very
long
and
very
dreary
days
and
to
margaret
very
long
and
penitential
ones
but
colonel
hugonin
enjoyed
them
thoroughly
for
as
he
feelingly
and
frequently
observed
it
is
an
immense
consolation
to
any
man
to
reflect
that
his
home
no
longer
contains
more
damn
foolishness
to
the
square
inch
than
any
other
house
in
the
united
states
on
all
sides
they
sought
for
flinks
but
they
never
found
him
and
to
this
day
they
have
never
found
him
the
fates
having
played
their
pawn
swept
it
from
the
board
and
flinks
disappeared
in
clotho
capacious
pocket
all
this
time
the
young
people
saw
nothing
of
one
another
on
this
point
jeal
was
adamantean
in
a
he
vehemently
declared
a
woman
is
well
enough
but
woman
is
the
devil
and
all
i
told
that
young
man
plainly
sir
that
he
does
see
your
daughter
till
he
gets
well
and
by
george
sir
he
get
well
now
just
in
order
to
see
her
nature
is
the
only
doctor
who
ever
cures
anybody
colonel
we
humans
for
all
our
and
lancets
can
only
prompt
her
and
devilish
demoralising
advice
we
generally
give
her
too
he
added
with
a
chuckle
peggy
this
was
the
first
observation
of
woods
when
he
came
to
his
senses
he
swore
feebly
when
peggy
was
denied
to
him
he
pleaded
he
scolded
he
even
threatened
as
a
last
resort
to
get
out
of
bed
and
go
in
immediate
search
of
her
and
in
return
jeal
told
him
very
affably
that
it
was
far
less
difficult
to
manage
a
patient
in
a
than
one
out
of
it
and
that
personally
nothing
would
please
him
so
much
as
a
plausible
pretext
for
clapping
woods
into
one
of
jeal
had
his
own
methods
in
dealing
with
the
fractious
then
billy
clamoured
for
colonel
hugonin
and
subsequently
the
colonel
came
in
some
bewilderment
to
his
daughter
rooms
billy
says
that
will
ai
to
be
probated
he
informed
her
testily
i
to
make
sure
it
ai
probated
till
he
gets
well
you
to
give
me
your
word
you
do
nothing
further
in
the
matter
till
billy
gets
well
that
his
message
and
i
like
to
know
what
the
devil
this
infernal
nonsense
means
i
ai
a
fenian
nor
yet
a
guy
fawkes
daughter
and
in
consequence
i
free
to
confess
i
do
care
for
all
this
damn
mystery
and
but
that
the
message
miss
hugonin
debated
with
herself
that
i
will
do
nothing
further
in
the
matter
till
billy
gets
well
she
repeated
reflectively
yes
i
suppose
i
have
to
promise
it
but
you
can
tell
him
for
me
that
i
consider
he
is
and
just
as
obstinate
and
selfish
as
he
can
be
can
you
remember
that
attractive
yes
thank
you
said
the
colonel
i
can
remember
it
but
i
going
to
nice
sort
of
message
to
send
a
sick
man
ai
it
i
know
what
gotten
into
you
margaret
no
begad
i
do
i
think
you
possessed
of
seventeen
devils
and
now
the
old
gentleman
demanded
after
an
awkward
pause
are
you
or
are
you
not
going
to
tell
me
what
all
this
mystery
is
about
i
ca
miss
hugonin
protested
it
it
a
secret
attractive
it
ai
said
the
colonel
flatly
it
some
more
damn
foolishness
and
he
went
away
in
a
fret
and
using
language
xxxii
left
to
herself
miss
hugonin
meditated
miss
hugonin
was
in
her
kimono
and
oh
madame
chrysastheme
oh
madame
butterfly
oh
mimosa
san
and
pitti
sing
and
yum
yum
and
all
ye
vaunted
beauties
of
japan
if
you
could
have
seen
her
in
that
garb
poor
little
ladies
of
the
orient
how
hopelessly
you
would
have
wrung
your
fingers
poor
little
ichabods
of
the
east
whose
glory
departed
irretrievably
when
she
adopted
this
garment
i
tremble
to
think
of
the
and
palpitations
and
that
would
have
ensued
it
was
pink
the
pink
of
her
cheeks
to
a
shade
and
scattered
about
it
were
birds
and
butterflies
and
snaky
emaciated
dragons
with
backs
like
and
prodigious
fangs
and
claws
and
very
curly
tails
such
as
they
breed
in
nankeen
plates
and
used
to
breed
on
packages
of
all
done
in
gold
the
gold
of
her
hair
moreover
one
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
neck
which
was
a
manifest
favour
of
the
gods
and
about
it
mysterious
lacy
white
things
intermingling
with
divers
tiny
blue
ribbons
i
saw
her
in
it
once
by
accident
and
now
i
fancy
as
she
stood
rigid
with
indignation
her
cheeks
flushed
it
must
have
been
a
heady
spectacle
to
note
how
their
repeated
the
pink
of
her
fantastic
garment
like
a
chromatic
echo
and
how
her
sunny
hair
a
thought
loosened
a
shade
dishevelled
clung
heavily
about
her
face
a
golden
snare
for
eye
and
heart
and
how
her
own
eyes
enormous
cerulean
twin
sapphires
such
as
in
the
old
days
might
have
ransomed
a
brace
of
emperors
grew
wistful
like
a
child
who
has
been
punished
and
does
not
know
exactly
why
and
how
her
petulant
mouth
quivered
and
the
long
black
lashes
golden
at
the
roots
quivered
too
ah
yes
it
must
have
been
a
heady
spectacle
she
announced
i
see
plainly
what
he
intends
doing
he
is
going
to
destroy
that
will
and
burden
me
once
more
with
a
large
and
influential
fortune
i
do
want
it
and
i
wo
take
it
and
he
might
just
as
well
understand
that
in
the
very
beginning
i
do
care
if
uncle
fred
did
leave
it
to
me
i
did
ask
him
to
did
i
besides
he
was
a
very
foolish
old
man
if
he
had
left
the
money
to
billy
would
have
been
all
right
that
always
the
way
my
dolls
are
invariably
stuffed
with
sawdust
and
i
have
a
dear
gazelle
to
glad
me
with
his
dappled
hide
but
when
he
comes
to
know
me
well
he
falls
upon
the
buttered
side
or
something
to
that
effect
i
hate
poetry
anyhow
it
so
mushy
and
this
from
the
miss
hugonin
who
a
week
ago
was
interested
in
the
french
and
partial
to
from
the
romaic
i
think
we
may
fairly
deduce
that
the
reign
of
felix
kennaston
is
over
the
king
is
dead
and
margaret
thoughts
and
affections
and
her
very
dreams
have
fallen
loyally
to
crying
long
live
the
king
his
majesty
billy
the
first
oh
said
margaret
with
an
indignant
gasp
what
time
her
eyebrows
gesticulated
i
think
billy
woods
is
a
meddlesome
what
i
think
does
he
suppose
that
after
waiting
all
this
time
for
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
can
keep
me
interested
for
four
hours
on
a
stretch
and
send
my
pulse
up
to
a
hundred
and
make
me
feel
those
thrilly
thrills
i
always
longed
for
does
he
suppose
that
now
i
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
his
silly
notions
about
wills
and
things
he
abominably
selfish
i
sha
margaret
moved
across
the
room
shimmering
rustling
glittering
like
a
fairy
in
a
pantomime
then
to
consider
matters
at
greater
ease
she
curled
up
on
a
divan
in
much
the
attitude
of
a
tiny
cleopatra
riding
at
anchor
on
a
carpeted
cydnus
billy
thinks
i
want
the
money
bless
his
boots
he
thinks
i
a
grasping
little
pig
and
he
has
every
right
to
think
so
after
the
way
i
talked
to
him
though
he
ought
to
have
realised
i
was
in
a
temper
about
kathleen
saumarez
and
have
paid
no
attention
to
what
i
said
and
he
actually
attempted
to
reason
with
me
if
he
had
consideration
for
my
feelings
he
have
simply
smacked
me
and
made
me
behave
however
he
a
man
and
all
men
are
selfish
and
a
skinny
old
thing
and
i
had
any
use
for
her
bother
her
lectures
i
never
understood
a
word
of
them
and
i
do
believe
she
does
either
women
clubs
are
silly
and
i
think
the
women
who
belong
to
them
are
jigs
if
they
had
any
sense
they
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
the
babies
instead
of
messing
with
philanthropy
and
education
and
theosophy
and
anything
else
that
they
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
and
they
call
that
being
cultured
culture
i
hate
the
word
i
do
want
to
be
cultured
i
want
to
be
happy
this
you
will
observe
was
in
effect
a
sweeping
recantation
of
every
ideal
margaret
had
ever
boasted
but
love
is
a
canny
pedagogue
and
of
late
he
had
instructed
miss
hugonin
in
a
variety
of
matters
before
god
loving
you
as
i
do
i
would
marry
you
for
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
she
repeated
with
a
little
shiver
even
in
his
delirium
he
said
that
but
i
now
that
he
loves
me
and
i
know
that
i
adore
him
and
if
this
were
a
sensible
world
i
walk
right
in
there
and
explain
things
and
ask
him
to
marry
me
and
then
it
matter
in
the
least
who
had
the
money
but
i
ca
because
it
would
be
proper
bother
propriety
but
bothering
it
does
do
any
good
as
long
as
i
have
the
money
billy
will
never
come
near
me
because
of
the
idiotic
way
i
talked
to
him
and
he
bent
on
my
taking
the
money
simply
because
it
happens
to
belong
to
me
i
consider
that
a
very
silly
reason
i
billy
woods
take
the
money
and
i
make
him
see
that
i
a
little
pig
and
that
i
trust
him
implicitly
and
i
think
i
quite
justified
in
using
a
little
call
it
diplomacy
because
otherwise
he
go
back
to
france
or
some
other
objectionable
place
and
we
both
be
unhappy
margaret
began
to
laugh
softly
i
given
him
my
word
that
do
nothing
further
in
the
matter
till
he
gets
well
and
i
wo
miss
hugonin
rose
from
the
divan
with
a
gesture
of
sweeping
back
her
hair
and
then
oh
treachery
of
oh
the
villainy
of
those
little
gold
the
fat
twisted
coils
tumbled
loose
and
slowly
unravelled
themselves
and
her
face
showed
a
delectable
wedge
between
big
odourful
crinkly
ponderous
masses
of
hair
it
clung
about
her
a
heavy
cloak
all
shimmering
gold
like
the
path
of
sunset
over
the
june
sea
and
margaret
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
laughed
and
appeared
perfectly
content
with
what
she
saw
there
but
said
she
if
the
fates
are
kind
to
me
and
i
sometimes
think
i
a
pull
with
the
gods
i
make
you
happy
billy
woods
in
spite
of
yourself
the
mirror
flashed
back
a
smile
margaret
was
strangely
interested
in
the
mirror
she
has
ringlets
in
her
hair
sang
margaret
happily
a
low
little
song
she
held
up
a
strand
of
it
to
demonstrate
this
fact
there
a
dimple
in
her
chin
and
indeed
there
was
and
a
dimple
in
either
cheek
too
for
a
long
time
afterward
she
continued
to
smile
at
the
mirror
i
am
afraid
kathleen
saumarez
was
right
she
was
a
vain
little
cat
was
margaret
but
barring
a
rearrangement
of
the
cosmic
scheme
i
dare
say
maids
will
continue
to
delight
in
their
own
comeliness
so
long
as
mirrors
speak
truth
let
us
then
leave
miss
hugonin
to
this
innocent
diversion
the
staidest
of
us
are
conscious
of
a
brisk
elation
at
sight
of
a
pretty
face
and
surely
no
considerate
person
will
deny
its
owner
a
portion
of
the
pleasure
that
daily
she
accords
the
beggar
at
the
xxxiii
we
are
credibly
informed
that
time
travels
in
divers
paces
with
divers
persons
the
statement
being
made
by
a
lady
who
may
be
considered
to
speak
with
some
authority
having
triumphantly
withstood
the
ravages
of
chronos
for
a
matter
of
three
centuries
but
i
doubt
if
even
the
insolent
sweet
wit
of
rosalind
could
have
devised
a
fitting
simile
for
time
gait
at
selwoode
those
five
days
that
billy
lay
abed
margaret
could
not
but
marvel
at
the
flourishing
proportion
attained
by
the
hours
in
those
sunlit
spring
days
and
at
dinner
say
her
thoughts
harking
back
to
luncheon
recalled
it
by
a
vigorous
effort
as
an
affair
of
the
dim
a
mere
blurred
memory
faint
and
vague
as
a
druidical
tenet
or
a
merovingian
squabble
but
the
time
passed
for
all
that
and
eventually
it
was
just
before
dusk
she
came
with
martin
jeal
permission
into
the
room
where
billy
was
and
beside
the
big
open
fireplace
where
a
wood
fire
chattered
companionably
sat
a
very
pallid
billy
a
rather
thin
billy
with
a
great
many
bandages
about
his
head
you
may
depend
upon
it
margaret
was
not
looking
her
worst
that
afternoon
by
actual
count
célestine
had
done
her
hair
six
times
before
reaching
an
acceptable
result
and
yes
célestine
you
may
get
out
that
pale
yellow
dress
no
beautiful
the
one
with
the
black
satin
stripes
on
the
bodice
because
i
do
want
my
hair
cast
completely
in
the
shade
do
i
now
let
me
see
black
feather
gloves
large
pompadour
a
sweet
smile
no
i
do
want
a
fan
that
a
lydia
languish
and
silk
skirts
rustling
like
the
deadest
leaves
imaginable
yes
i
think
that
will
do
and
if
you
ca
hook
up
my
dress
without
pecking
and
pecking
at
me
like
that
i
probably
go
stark
crazy
célestine
and
then
you
be
sorry
no
it
is
a
bit
tight
are
you
perfectly
certain
there
no
powder
behind
my
ears
célestine
now
try
to
fasten
the
collar
without
pulling
all
my
hair
down
i
think
that
will
do
célestine
well
it
very
nice
of
you
to
say
so
but
i
do
believe
i
much
fancy
myself
in
yellow
after
all
equipped
and
armed
for
conquest
then
she
came
into
the
room
with
a
very
tolerable
affectation
of
unconcern
altogether
it
was
a
quite
effective
entrance
i
been
for
a
little
drive
billy
she
mendaciously
informed
him
that
how
you
happen
to
have
the
opportunity
of
seeing
me
in
all
my
nice
new
are
you
pleased
billy
no
do
you
dare
get
up
margaret
stood
across
the
room
peeling
off
her
gloves
and
regarding
him
on
the
whole
with
disapproval
they
been
starving
you
she
pensively
reflected
as
soon
as
that
jeal
person
goes
away
i
shall
have
six
little
beefsteaks
cooked
and
see
to
it
personally
that
you
eat
every
one
of
them
and
i
cook
a
cherry
pie
quick
as
a
cat
can
wink
her
eye
wo
i
billy
that
jeal
person
is
a
decided
nuisance
said
miss
hugonin
as
she
stabbed
her
hat
rather
viciously
with
two
and
then
laid
it
aside
on
a
table
billy
woods
was
looking
up
at
her
forlornly
it
hurt
her
to
see
the
love
and
sorrow
in
his
face
but
oh
how
avidly
his
soul
drank
in
the
modulations
of
that
voice
a
voice
that
was
honey
and
gold
and
velvet
and
all
that
is
most
sweet
and
rich
and
soft
in
the
world
peggy
said
he
plunging
at
the
heart
of
things
where
that
will
miss
hugonin
kicked
forward
a
little
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
and
sat
down
and
complacently
smoothed
out
her
skirts
i
knew
it
said
she
i
never
saw
such
a
person
in
my
life
i
knew
that
would
be
the
very
first
thing
you
would
ask
for
billy
woods
because
you
such
an
obstinate
stiffnecked
very
well
and
margaret
tossed
her
head
here
uncle
fred
will
then
and
you
can
do
as
you
like
with
it
and
i
hope
you
satisfied
and
margaret
handed
him
the
long
envelope
which
lay
in
her
lap
woods
promptly
opened
it
that
miss
hugonin
commented
is
what
i
term
very
unladylike
behaviour
on
your
part
you
evidently
do
trust
me
billy
woods
very
well
i
do
care
read
it
carefully
very
carefully
and
make
quite
sure
i
have
been
dabbling
in
forgery
of
late
besides
it
so
good
for
your
eyes
you
know
after
being
hit
over
the
head
margaret
suggested
cheerfully
billy
chuckled
that
true
said
he
but
i
know
uncle
fred
fist
well
enough
without
having
to
read
it
all
candidly
peggy
i
to
look
at
it
because
i
well
i
did
quite
trust
you
peggy
and
now
we
going
to
burn
this
interesting
paper
you
and
i
wait
margaret
cried
ah
wait
just
a
moment
billy
he
glanced
up
at
her
in
surprise
the
paper
still
poised
in
his
hand
she
sat
with
head
drooped
forward
her
masculine
little
chin
thrust
out
eagerly
her
candid
eyes
transparently
appraising
him
why
are
you
going
to
burn
it
billy
why
woods
repeated
thoughtfully
well
for
a
variety
of
reasons
first
is
that
uncle
fred
really
did
leave
his
money
to
you
and
burning
this
is
the
only
way
of
making
sure
you
get
it
why
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
burn
it
last
time
i
saw
you
i
was
in
a
temper
said
margaret
haughtily
you
ought
to
have
seen
that
yes
i
er
noticed
it
woods
admitted
with
some
dryness
but
it
was
only
temper
you
grown
accustomed
to
the
money
miss
it
now
miss
the
pleasure
it
gives
you
miss
the
power
it
gives
you
you
never
be
content
to
go
back
to
the
old
life
now
why
peggy
you
yourself
told
me
you
thought
money
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
it
has
changed
you
peggy
this
ah
well
said
billy
we
wo
talk
about
that
i
going
to
burn
it
because
that
the
only
honourable
thing
to
do
ready
peggy
it
may
be
honourable
but
it
silly
margaret
temporised
and
for
my
part
i
very
very
glad
god
had
run
out
of
a
sense
of
honour
when
he
created
the
woman
phrases
do
alter
matters
ready
peggy
ah
no
phrases
do
alter
matters
she
assented
with
a
quick
lift
of
speech
you
going
to
destroy
that
will
billy
woods
simply
because
you
think
i
a
horrid
mercenary
selfish
you
think
i
could
give
up
the
money
you
think
i
could
be
happy
without
it
well
you
have
every
right
to
think
so
after
the
way
i
behaved
but
why
not
tell
me
that
is
the
real
reason
billy
raised
his
hand
in
protest
i
i
think
you
might
miss
it
he
conceded
yes
i
think
you
would
miss
it
listen
said
margaret
quickly
the
money
is
yours
now
by
my
act
you
say
you
care
for
me
if
i
am
the
sort
of
woman
you
think
me
i
do
say
i
am
and
i
do
say
i
not
but
thinking
me
that
sort
of
woman
do
you
think
i
i
marry
you
for
the
asking
if
you
kept
the
money
do
you
think
you
losing
every
chance
of
me
by
burning
that
will
oh
i
not
standing
on
conventionalities
now
do
you
think
that
billy
she
was
tempting
him
to
the
uttermost
and
her
heart
was
sick
with
fear
lest
he
might
yield
this
was
the
eagle
last
battle
and
recreant
love
fought
with
the
eagle
against
poor
billy
who
had
only
his
honour
to
help
him
margaret
face
was
pale
as
she
bent
toward
him
her
lips
parted
a
little
her
eyes
glinting
eerily
in
the
firelight
the
room
was
dark
now
save
in
the
small
radius
of
its
amber
glow
beyond
that
was
darkness
where
panels
and
brasses
blinked
yes
said
billy
gravely
forgive
me
if
i
wrong
dear
but
i
do
think
that
but
you
see
you
do
care
for
me
peggy
in
the
i
thought
for
a
moment
ah
well
you
shown
in
a
hundred
ways
that
you
do
care
and
i
would
have
you
come
to
me
not
caring
so
i
going
to
burn
the
paper
dear
margaret
bowed
her
head
had
she
ever
known
happiness
before
it
is
not
very
flattering
to
me
she
said
but
it
shows
that
you
care
a
great
deal
you
care
enough
to
let
me
go
ah
yes
you
may
burn
it
now
billy
and
promptly
he
tossed
it
into
the
flames
for
a
moment
it
lay
unharmed
then
the
edges
caught
and
crackled
and
blazed
and
their
heads
drew
near
together
as
they
watched
it
burn
there
thought
billy
is
the
end
ah
ropes
daggers
and
poisons
there
is
the
end
oh
peggy
peggy
if
you
could
only
have
loved
me
if
only
this
accursed
money
had
spoiled
you
so
utterly
billy
was
quite
properly
miserable
over
it
but
he
raised
his
head
with
a
smile
and
now
said
he
and
not
without
a
little
little
bitterness
if
i
have
any
right
to
advise
you
peggy
i
i
think
i
be
more
careful
in
the
future
as
to
how
i
used
the
money
you
tried
to
do
good
with
it
i
know
but
every
good
cause
has
its
parasites
do
trust
entirely
to
the
haggages
and
jukesburys
peggy
and
and
do
desert
the
good
ship
philanthropy
because
there
are
a
few
barnacles
on
it
dear
you
make
me
awfully
tired
miss
hugonin
observed
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
how
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
do
anything
for
philanthropy
or
any
other
cause
when
i
have
a
penny
in
the
world
you
see
just
burned
the
last
will
uncle
fred
ever
made
the
one
that
left
everything
to
me
the
one
in
your
favour
was
probated
or
proved
or
whatever
they
call
it
a
week
ago
i
think
billy
was
surprised
she
stood
over
him
sharply
outlined
against
the
darkness
clasping
her
hands
tightly
just
under
her
chin
ludicrously
suggestive
of
a
saint
in
the
firelight
her
hair
was
an
aureole
and
her
gown
yellow
with
multitudinous
tiny
arabesques
of
black
velvet
echoed
the
glow
of
her
hair
to
a
shade
the
dancing
flames
made
of
her
a
flickering
little
yellow
wraith
and
oh
the
quaint
tenderness
of
her
eyes
oh
the
hint
of
faint
nameless
perfume
she
diffused
thus
ran
the
meditations
of
billy
dizzied
brain
listen
i
told
you
i
burned
the
other
will
i
started
to
burn
it
but
i
was
afraid
to
because
i
did
know
what
they
could
do
to
me
if
i
did
so
i
put
it
away
in
my
little
and
if
you
had
a
of
sense
you
have
noticed
the
orris
on
it
and
you
made
me
promise
not
to
take
any
steps
in
the
matter
till
you
got
well
i
knew
you
would
so
i
had
already
sent
that
second
will
sent
it
before
i
promised
you
to
hunston
wyke
he
my
lawyer
now
you
know
and
heard
from
him
and
he
has
probated
it
billy
was
making
various
irrelevant
sounds
and
i
brought
that
other
will
to
you
and
if
you
did
choose
to
examine
it
more
carefully
i
sure
it
was
my
fault
i
kept
my
word
like
a
perfect
gentleman
and
took
no
step
in
the
matter
i
did
say
a
word
when
before
my
eyes
you
stripped
me
of
my
entire
worldly
possessions
you
know
i
did
you
burned
it
up
yourself
billy
woods
of
your
own
free
will
and
accord
and
now
selwoode
and
all
that
detestable
money
belongs
to
and
i
sure
i
like
to
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
about
it
so
margaret
faced
him
defiantly
billy
was
in
a
state
of
considerable
perturbation
why
have
you
done
this
he
asked
slowly
but
a
lucent
something
half
fear
half
gladness
was
wakening
in
billy
eyes
and
her
eyes
answered
him
but
her
tongue
was
far
less
veracious
because
you
thought
i
was
a
because
you
could
make
allowances
for
a
girl
who
for
four
years
has
seen
nothing
but
money
and
and
the
power
of
money
because
i
wanted
your
your
respect
billy
and
you
thought
i
could
give
it
up
very
well
miss
hugonin
waved
her
hand
airily
toward
the
hearth
now
i
hope
you
know
better
you
dare
get
up
billy
woods
but
i
think
nothing
short
of
brute
force
could
have
kept
woods
from
her
peggy
he
babbled
ah
forgive
me
if
i
a
presumptuous
ass
but
was
it
because
you
knew
i
could
ask
you
to
marry
me
so
long
as
you
had
the
money
she
dallied
with
her
bliss
margaret
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
why
why
of
course
it
was
she
panted
what
nonsense
look
at
me
peggy
i
do
want
to
you
look
like
a
fright
with
your
head
all
tied
up
peggy
this
exercise
is
bad
for
an
invalid
i
oh

is
bad
for
you
not
until

tell
me

your
foot

your
poor
head

i
sit
on
this
nice
little
footstool

you
ca

the
stupidest
beautiful
in

back
any
longer
billy

peggy

must
abuse
kathleen
she
a
friend
of
mine

friend
of
yours

prevent
her
being
skinny

to
seek
a
wife
billy
boy
and
oh
the
dimple
in
her
chin
ah
well
there
was
a
deal
of
foolish
prattle
there
in
the
firelight
delectable
prattle
irresponsible
as
the
chattering
of
birds
after
a
storm
and
i
fancy
that
the
eagle
shadow
is
lifted
from
selwoode
now
that
love
has
taken
up
his
abode
there
the
end
