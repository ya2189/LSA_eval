chapter
i
expelled
andrew
wildwood
the
village
schoolmaster
of
fairview
spoke
this
name
in
a
tone
of
severity
he
accompanied
the
utterance
with
a
bang
of
the
ruler
that
made
the
desk
before
him
rattle
there
was
fire
in
his
eye
and
his
lip
trembled
half
of
the
twenty
odd
scholars
before
him
looked
frightened
the
others
interested
none
had
ever
before
seen
the
dull
sleepy
pedagogue
so
wrought
up
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
lad
of
about
sixteen
seated
in
the
front
row
of
desks
the
name
called
out
applied
to
him
it
had
been
abbreviated
so
commonly
however
that
its
full
dignity
seemed
to
daze
him
for
the
moment
andrew
wildwood
slowly
arose
his
big
fearless
eyes
fixed
dubiously
on
the
schoolmaster
yes
sir
he
said
step
forward
sir
andy
wildwood
did
so
he
was
now
in
full
view
of
the
other
scholars
darrow
also
arose
he
thrust
one
hand
behind
his
long
coat
tails
twirling
them
fiercely
from
the
little
platform
that
was
his
throne
he
glared
down
at
the
unabashed
andy
in
his
other
hand
he
flourished
the
long
black
ruler
threateningly
he
pointed
a
terrible
finger
towards
two
desks
about
four
feet
apart
at
one
side
of
the
room
the
desk
nearest
to
the
wall
had
its
top
split
clear
across
and
one
corner
was
splintered
off
did
you
break
that
desk
demanded
the
pedagogue
andy
lips
puckered
slightly
in
a
comical
twist
he
had
a
vivid
imagination
and
the
shattered
desk
suggested
an
exciting
and
pleasurable
moment
in
the
near
past
some
one
chuckled
at
the
rear
of
the
room
andy
face
broke
into
an
irrepressible
smile
order
roared
the
schoolmaster
bringing
down
the
ruler
with
a
loud
bang
young
man
i
asked
you
did
you
break
that
desk
yes
sir
i
afraid
i
smashed
it
said
andy
in
a
rather
subdued
tone
it
was
an
accident
he
was
only
fooling
teacher
in
an
excited
lisp
spoke
up
little
tod
smith
the
youngest
pupil
in
the
school
he
broke
the
desk
but
say
teacher
he
did
it
yes
sir
andy
did
the
double
somersault
just
like
a
real
circus
actor
and
landed
square
on
both
feet
the
eyes
of
andy
diminutive
champion
and
admirer
sparkled
like
diamonds
a
murmur
of
delight
and
sympathy
went
the
rounds
of
the
schoolroom
darrow
glared
savagely
at
the
boy
he
brandished
the
ruler
wildly
sending
an
ink
bottle
rolling
to
the
floor
as
a
titter
greeted
this
catastrophe
he
lost
his
temper
and
dignity
completely
springing
down
from
the
platform
he
made
a
swoop
upon
andy
the
latter
stood
his
ground
and
there
was
a
shock
then
andy
was
swayed
to
and
fro
as
the
schoolmaster
grasped
his
arm
young
man
spoke
darrow
in
a
shaking
tone
this
is
the
limit
an
example
must
be
made
last
week
you
tore
down
the
schoolhouse
chimney
with
your
ridiculous
tight
rope
performances
and
was
it
just
jolly
gloated
a
juvenile
gleesome
voice
in
a
loud
whisper
the
schoolmaster
swept
the
room
with
a
shocked
glance
it
had
no
effect
upon
the
effervescence
of
his
pupils
every
imagination
was
vividly
recalling
the
rope
tied
from
the
schoolhouse
chimney
to
a
near
tree
every
heart
renewed
the
thrills
that
had
greeted
andy
wildwood
daring
walk
across
the
quivering
cable
then
the
culminating
climax
the
giving
way
of
the
chimney
a
shower
of
bricks
but
the
young
gymnast
safe
and
serene
dangling
from
the
eaves
last
week
also
continued
the
schoolmaster
you
stole
farmer
calf
and
carried
it
five
miles
away
you
are
complained
of
continually
as
i
said
young
man
you
have
reached
the
limit
human
patience
and
endurance
can
go
no
farther
you
are
demoralizing
this
school
and
now
concluded
darrow
his
lips
setting
grimly
you
must
toe
the
mark
a
hush
of
expectancy
of
rare
excitement
pervaded
the
room
the
schoolmaster
swung
aloft
the
ruler
with
one
hand
he
swung
andy
around
directly
in
front
of
him
with
the
other
hand
andy
face
suddenly
grew
serious
he
tugged
to
get
loose
hold
on
darrow
he
spoke
quickly
you
must
strike
me
how
what
defiance
on
top
of
rebellion
shouted
the
irate
pedagogue
keep
your
seats
he
roared
as
half
the
school
came
upright
under
the
tense
strain
of
the
moment
the
next
he
was
struggling
with
andy
forward
and
backward
then
went
over
the
clear
recitation
space
the
ruler
was
dropped
in
the
scrimmage
as
darrow
stooped
to
repossess
it
andy
managed
to
break
loose
dodging
behind
the
zinc
shield
that
fronted
the
stove
he
caught
its
top
with
both
hands
he
moved
about
presenting
a
difficult
barrier
against
easy
capture
andy
looked
pretty
determined
now
the
schoolmaster
was
so
angry
that
his
face
was
as
red
as
a
piece
of
flannel
he
advanced
again
upon
the
culprit
so
choked
up
that
his
lips
made
only
inarticulate
sounds
one
minute
please
darrow
said
andy
you
must
try
to
whip
me
i
ca
stand
it
and
i
wo
it
has
been
the
rule
here
ever
i
did
wrong
though
i
could
help
it
and
i
sorry
for
it
i
stand
double
study
and
staying
in
from
recess
and
after
school
for
a
month
if
you
say
so
you
can
put
me
in
the
dark
hole
and
keep
me
without
my
dinner
as
long
as
you
like
i
have
lots
of
good
friends
here
i
be
ashamed
to
face
them
after
a
whipping
and
i
wo
yes
yes
he
right
rang
out
an
earnest
chorus
silence
roared
the
schoolmaster
an
example
must
be
made
i
shall
do
my
duty
andrew
wildwood
graham
what
do
you
mean
sir
the
scholars
thrilled
as
a
new
and
unexpected
element
came
into
the
situation
graham
quite
a
young
man
and
double
the
weight
of
the
schoolmaster
had
arisen
from
his
seat
he
walked
quietly
between
darrow
and
andy
quite
pushing
back
the
former
gently
the
lad
is
right
darrow
he
said
in
his
quiet
drawling
way
i
would
punish
him
before
the
scholars
if
i
were
you
sir
what
this
you
interfere
flared
out
the
pedagogue
do
take
it
that
way
darrow
said
graham
you
are
displeased
and
justly
so
sir
but
boys
will
be
boys
andy
is
the
right
kind
of
a
lad
i
assure
you
only
in
the
wrong
kind
of
a
place
they
did
the
same
thing
with
me
when
i
was
young
if
they
had
i
would
be
here
spelling
out
words
of
two
syllables
at
years
of
age
andy
eyes
glistened
at
the
big
scholar
friendliness
a
murmur
of
approbation
ran
round
the
room
silently
the
pedagogue
fumed
the
disaffection
of
the
occasion
mild
and
respectful
as
it
was
disarmed
him
he
regarded
andy
with
a
despairing
look
then
he
straightened
up
with
great
dignity
take
your
seat
sir
he
ordered
andy
severely
marching
back
to
his
own
desk
yes
sir
said
andy
humbly
pack
up
your
books
andy
looked
up
in
dismay
the
fixed
glint
in
the
schoolmaster
eye
told
him
that
this
new
move
meant
no
fooling
now
you
may
go
home
resumed
darrow
as
andy
had
obeyed
his
first
mandate
andy
kept
a
stiff
upper
lip
though
he
felt
that
the
world
was
slipping
away
from
him
a
picture
of
an
unloving
home
a
stern
hard
mistress
who
would
make
use
of
this
his
final
disgrace
as
a
continual
club
and
menace
to
all
his
future
peace
of
mind
fairly
appalled
him
he
arose
to
his
feet
swinging
his
strapped
up
books
to
and
fro
airily
but
there
was
a
dismal
catch
in
his
voice
as
he
turned
to
the
desk
and
said
darrow
i
guess
i
would
rather
take
the
whipping
too
late
pronounced
the
relentless
schoolmaster
in
icy
tones
and
then
as
andy
reached
the
door
amid
the
gruesome
silence
and
awe
of
his
sympathetic
comrades
darrow
added
the
final
dreadful
words
you
are
expelled
chapter
ii
andy
wildwood
passed
out
of
the
village
schoolhouse
an
anxious
and
desolate
boy
the
brightest
of
sunshine
gilded
the
spires
and
steeples
of
the
village
it
flooded
highway
and
meadows
with
rich
yellow
light
but
andy
swinging
his
school
books
over
his
shoulder
walked
on
with
drooping
head
and
a
cheerless
heart
it
pretty
bad
it
just
the
very
worst
he
said
with
a
deep
sigh
as
he
reached
a
stile
and
sat
down
of
it
andy
tossed
his
books
up
into
the
hollow
of
a
familiar
oak
near
at
hand
then
he
fell
to
serious
thinking
his
gaze
roving
over
the
landscape
lit
on
the
farmhouse
of
jabez
dale
it
revived
the
recent
allusion
of
the
old
schoolmaster
i
did
steal
that
calf
declared
andy
straightening
up
indignantly
graham
who
boards
over
at
millville
told
us
boys
how
dale
had
sold
a
cow
to
a
farmer
there
he
said
they
took
her
away
from
her
calf
and
the
poor
thing
refused
to
eat
she
just
paced
up
and
down
a
pasture
fence
from
morning
till
night
crying
for
her
calf
we
got
the
calf
and
carried
it
to
its
mother
i
never
forget
the
sight
and
i
never
regret
it
either
and
what
best
the
man
who
had
got
the
cow
was
so
worked
up
over
its
almost
human
grief
that
he
paid
dale
for
the
calf
too
and
kept
it
the
memory
of
the
incident
brightened
up
andy
momentarily
then
his
glance
flitting
to
the
distant
roof
of
a
small
neat
cottage
in
a
pretty
grove
of
cedars
his
face
fell
again
he
choked
on
a
great
lump
in
his
throat
ginger
he
whistled
dolefully
how
can
i
ever
face
the
music
over
there
the
cottage
was
andy
home
but
the
thought
had
no
charm
or
sweetness
for
the
lone
orphan
boy
whom
its
roof
had
grudgingly
sheltered
for
the
past
five
years
once
it
had
belonged
to
his
father
he
had
died
when
andy
was
ten
years
old
then
it
had
passed
into
the
legal
possession
of
miss
lavinia
talcott
this
aunt
was
andy
nearest
relative
he
had
lived
with
her
since
his
father
death
if
it
could
be
called
living
miss
lavinia
favorite
topic
was
the
sure
visitation
of
the
sins
of
the
father
upon
his
children
she
was
of
a
sour
snappy
disposition
her
prim
boast
and
pride
was
that
she
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
to
a
lad
of
andy
free
and
easy
nature
her
rules
and
regulations
were
torture
and
an
abomination
she
made
him
take
off
his
muddy
shoes
in
the
woodshed
woe
to
him
if
he
ever
brought
a
splinter
of
whittling
or
a
fragment
of
nutshell
into
the
distressingly
neat
kitchen
only
one
day
in
the
week
sunday
was
andy
allowed
the
honor
of
sitting
in
the
best
room
then
for
six
mortal
hours
his
aching
limbs
were
glued
to
a
chair
there
in
parlor
state
he
sat
listening
to
the
prim
old
maid
reading
religious
works
or
some
scientific
lecture
or
a
dreary
dissertation
on
good
behavior
she
never
allowed
a
schoolmate
to
visit
him
even
in
the
yard
she
restricted
his
hours
of
play
and
all
the
time
never
gave
him
a
loving
word
or
caress
on
the
contrary
many
times
a
week
miss
lavinia
administered
a
that
suggested
perpetual
motion
wildwood
had
been
something
of
an
inventor
he
had
gotten
up
a
hoisting
derrick
that
was
very
clever
it
brought
him
some
money
this
he
sunk
in
an
impossible
balloon
crippled
himself
in
the
initial
voyage
of
his
airship
and
died
shortly
afterwards
of
a
broken
heart
andy
mother
had
died
when
he
was
an
infant
thus
it
was
that
he
fell
into
the
charge
of
his
unloving
aunt
it
seemed
that
the
latter
had
loaned
wildwood
some
money
for
his
scientific
experiments
as
repayment
when
he
died
she
took
the
cottage
and
what
else
was
left
of
the
wreck
of
his
former
fortune
even
this
she
claimed
did
not
pay
her
up
in
full
and
she
made
poor
andy
feel
all
the
time
that
he
was
eating
the
bread
of
charity
andy
grandfather
had
been
a
famous
sailor
andy
had
read
an
old
private
account
among
his
father
papers
of
a
momentous
voyage
his
grandfather
had
made
to
the
antarctic
circle
he
loved
to
picture
his
ancestor
among
the
ship
rigging
he
had
an
additional
enthusiasm
in
another
description
of
his
balloon
venture
andy
wished
he
had
been
born
to
fly
he
seemed
to
have
inherited
a
sort
of
natural
acrobatic
tendency
at
ten
years
of
age
he
was
the
best
boy
runner
and
jumper
in
the
village
the
first
circus
he
had
seen
not
with
miss
lavinia
permission
set
andy
fairly
wild
and
later
astonished
his
playmates
with
prodigious
feats
of
walking
on
a
barrel
somersaulting
vaulting
with
a
pole
and
numerous
other
amateur
gymnastic
attainments
for
the
past
month
a
circus
now
exhibiting
in
a
neighboring
town
had
been
advertised
in
glowing
prose
and
lurid
pictures
on
big
billboards
all
over
the
county
juvenile
fairview
was
set
on
fire
anew
with
the
circus
fever
feat
and
double
somersault
act
from
desk
to
desk
that
morning
had
resulted
getting
him
into
the
trouble
of
his
life
it
furthermore
had
interrupted
other
performances
on
the
programme
listed
for
later
on
that
very
day
andy
head
had
been
full
of
the
circus
since
he
had
seen
its
first
poster
at
a
he
could
never
pass
a
heap
of
sawdust
without
cutting
a
caper
in
the
spelling
contest
he
had
stupefied
his
fellow
students
by
nimbly
rattling
over
such
words
as
megatherian
stupendous
zoological
aggregation
and
the
like
one
of
his
sums
covered
the
number
of
yards
a
clown
could
cover
in
a
given
time
on
a
handspring
basis
he
had
shocked
the
schoolmaster
by
handing
in
an
essay
on
the
art
of
bareback
riding
andy
had
tried
every
acrobatic
trick
he
had
seen
depicted
in
the
glowing
advance
sheets
announcing
the
circus
to
repeated
efforts
in
this
direction
his
admiring
schoolmates
had
continually
incited
him
he
had
tried
the
double
somersault
in
the
schoolroom
that
morning
andy
had
made
a
famous
success
of
the
experiment
but
with
the
direful
result
of
smashing
a
desk
and
subsequent
expulsion
thinking
over
all
this
andy
realized
that
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
his
troubles
was
his
irrepressible
tendency
towards
acrobatic
performances
and
i
simply
ca
help
it
he
cried
in
a
kind
of
reckless
despair
it
born
in
me
i
guess
oh
do
i
hope
aunt
lavinia
turns
me
out
as
she
has
often
threatened
to
do
say
if
she
only
would
and
i
could
join
some
show
and
travel
and
see
things
and
live
andy
threw
himself
flat
on
the
green
sward
he
closed
his
eyes
and
gave
himself
up
to
a
rapture
of
thought
gay
banners
brightly
comparisoned
horses
white
wildernesses
of
circus
tents
tinselled
clowns
royal
ringmasters
joyful
strains
of
music
floated
through
his
active
brain
it
was
a
day
dream
of
rare
beauty
and
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
it
an
idle
hour
went
by
before
andy
realized
it
as
echoing
voices
rang
out
on
the
quiet
air
he
got
to
his
feet
rubbing
his
eyes
as
if
they
were
dazzled
recess
already
andy
said
well
i
lay

andy
went
in
among
the
shrubbery
farther
away
from

road
but
he
could
not
hide
himself
an
active
urchin
discovered
him
from
a
distance
he
yelled
out
riotously
to
his
comrades
and
they
all
came
trooping
along
in
andy
direction
their
expelled
schoolmate
and
favorite
greeted
them
with
a
genial
smile
never
showing
the
white
feather
in
the
least
his
chums
found
him
carelessly
tossing
crab
apples
from
hand
to
hand
andy
was
an
adept
in
the
glass
ball
act
he
described
rapid
semicircles
festoons
and
double
crosses
he
shot
the
green
objects
up
into
the
air
in
all
directions

interrupted

that

andy
consented
to
accompany
the
gleeful
expectant
throng
they
had
arranged
the
night
before
to
hold
an
amateur
circus
exhibition
on
their
own
hook
one
boy
had
agreed
to
provide
the
fiery
steed
for
the
occasion
alf
warren
was
to
be
property
man
and
donate
the
blazing
hoop
they
soon
reached
the
corner
of
the
lot
there
tethered
to
a
stake
and
grazing
placidly
was
a
horse
across
his
back
was
strapped
a
small
platform
made
of
a
cistern
cover
this
had
been
cushioned
with
a
folded
buggy
robe
alf
warren
dove
excitedly
into
a
clump
of
bushes
he
reappeared
triumphantly
holding
aloft
a
big
hoop
it
was
wound
round
and
round
with
strips
of
woolen
cloth
which
exuded
an
unmistakable
and
unpleasant
odor
of
kerosene
say
it
going
to
be
just
like
the
circus
picture
on
the
side
of
the
post
office
is
it
chuckled
little
tod
smith
ned
wilier
took
down
the
fence
bars
and
led
the
horse
out
into
the
road
andy
pulled
off
his
coat
and
shoes
he
stowed
them
alongside
a
rock
near
the
fence
then
he
produced
some
elastic
bands
and
secured
his
trousers
around
the
ankles
his
eyes
brightened
and
he
forgot
all
his
troubles
for
the
time
being
as
he
ran
back
a
bit
out
of
the
way
there
shouted
andy
with
glowing
cheeks
posing
for
a
forward
dash
he
made
a
quick
superb
bound
and
landed
lightly
on
the
horse
back
old
dobbin
shied
restively
ned
at
his
nose
quieted
him
with
a
word
andy
the
centre
of
an
admiring
group
tested
the
impromptu
platform
he
accepted
a
short
riding
whip
handed
up
to
him
by
alf
warren
with
a
truly
professional
flourish
andy
stood
easy
and
erect
one
hand
on
his
hip
all
that
seemed
lacking
was
the
sawdust
ring
and
a
tinselled
garb
ready
announced
andy
all
of
the
group
except
ned
wilfer
started
down
the
road
in
the
wake
of
alf
warren
the
latter
carried
the
hoop
in
one
hand
some
matches
in
the
other
the
mob
rounded
the
highway
purposely
selected
because
it
curved
and
disappeared
from
view
everything
all
right
andy
inquired
ned
strutting
about
with
quite
a
air
yes
if
the
horse
will
go
any
oh
he
get
up
full
speed
once
started
assured
ned
it
was
fully
five
minutes
before
an
expected
signal
reached
them
from
far
around
the
bend
in
the
road
there
suddenly
echoed
vivid
shouts
and
whistlings
start
him
up
ordered
andy
ned
led
the
horse
a
few
rods
and
got
him
to
running
then
dropping
to
the
rear
he
kept
pace
with
the
animal
slapping
one
flank
and
urging
him
up
to
greater
speed
he
fell
behind
but
kept
on
running
as
andy
guiding
the
horse
by
the
long
bridle
reins
occasionally
gave
him
a
stimulating
touch
of
the
light
whip
he
carried
five
hundred
feet
covered
old
dobbin
seemed
to
enjoy
the
novelty
of
the
occasion
and
kept
up
a
very
fair
gait
rounding
the
curve
in
the
road
and
looking
a
ahead
andy
could
see
his
schoolmates
gathered
around
a
tree
stump
surmounted
by
alf
warren
holding
the
hoop
aloft
just
here
too
for
the
space
of
a
mere
minute
andy
could
view
the
schoolhouse
through
a
break
in
the
timber
a
swift
side
glance
showed
the
big
scholar
graham
lounging
in
the
doorway
just
approaching
him
from
the
direction
of
the
village
was
the
old
schoolmaster
darrow
he
has
been
up
to
see
aunt
lavinia
that
the
reason
of
the
double
recess
thought
andy
his
heart
sinking
a
trifle
then
flinging
care
to
the
winds
for
the
occasion
he
uttered
a
ringing
andy
felt
that
he
must
do
justice
to
the
expectations
of
his
young
friends
he
swung
outward
on
one
foot
in
true
circus
ring
fashion
he
swayed
back
at
the
end
of
the
bridles
he
tipped
thrillingly
at
the
very
edge
of
the
cushioned
platform
all
the
time
by
shouts
and
whip
he
urged
up
old
dobbin
to
his
best
spurt
of
speed
at
the
schoolhouse
door
darrow
gazed
at
the
astonishing
spectacle
with
uplifted
hands
shocking
he
groaned
graham
there
goes
the
most
incorrigible
boy
in
fairview
yes
nodded
graham
with
a
quaint
smile
as
andy
wildwood
flashed
out
of
sight
past
the
break
in
the
timber
he
certainly
is
going
some
he
break
his
neck
i
trust
not
chapter
iii
disaster
old
dobbin
pricked
up
his
ears
and
kept
royally
to
his
task
as
he
seemed
to
enter
into
the
excitement
of
the
moment
andy
had
practiced
on
the
animal
on
several
previous
occasions
lumps
of
sugar
and
apples
had
rewarded
dobbin
at
the
end
of
the
performances
for
his
faithful
services
he
seemed
now
to
remember
this
as
he
galloped
along
towards
the
waiting
group
down
the
road
sometimes
andy
had
made
the
horseback
somersault
successfully
sometimes
he
had
failed
ignominiously
and
tumbled
to
the
ground
just
now
he
felt
no
doubt
of
the
result
the
padded
cushion
cover
was
broad
and
steady
he
kept
the
horse
close
to
the
inner
edge
of
the
road
the
tree
stump
upon
which
alf
warren
stood
just
lined
it
by
holding
the
hoop
extended
straight
out
the
horse
body
would
pass
directly
under
this
nearer
and
nearer
steed
and
rider
approached
the
point
of
interest
the
spectators
gaped
and
squirmed
vastly
excited
but
silent
now
about
one
hundred
feet
away
from
the
tree
stump
andy
shouted
out
the
quick
word
ready
at
once
alf
warren
drew
the
match
in
his
free
hand
across
his
coat
sleeve
it
lighted
he
applied
the
ignited
splinter
to
the
edge
of
the
hoop
the
covering
took
fire
instantly
the
blaze
ran
round
the
circle
the
hoop
burst
into
a
wreath
of
light
darting
flames
andy
fixed
a
calculating
eye
on
hoop
and
holder
two
inches
lower
he
ordered
keep
it
firm
the
horse
seemed
inclined
to
swerve
at
a
sight
of
the
fiery
hoop
andy
soothed
dobbin
by
word
and
kept
him
steady
with
the
bridle
reins
everything
seemed
working
smoothly
andy
moved
to
the
extreme
rear
edge
of
the
platform
and
poised
there
five
feet
away
from
the
hoop
he
dropped
the
riding
whip
then
he
flung
the
reins
across
the
horse
neck
with
nerve
and
precision
andy
started
a
forward
somersault
at
just
the
right
moment
he
felt
a
warm
wave
cross
his
face
as
he
made
the
complete
circle
he
knew
that
something
was
wrong
ouch
suddenly
yelled
out
alf
a
spurt
of
flame
had
shot
against
his
hand
that
held
the
short
stick
attached
to
the
hoop
alf
let
go
the
hoop
and
dropped
it
as
andy
came
down
righted
again
on
the
platform
one
foot
struck
the
narrow
edge
of
the
hoop
he
was
in
his
stocking
feet
and
the
contact
cut
the
instep
sharply
it
threw
andy
off
his
balance
he
tried
to
right
himself
but
failed
he
tipped
sideways
and
was
forced
to
jump
to
the
ground
the
hoop
fell
forward
against
the
horse
mane
with
a
wild
neigh
of
terror
and
pain
the
animal
leaped
to
one
side
carrying
away
a
section
of
rotten
fence
the
blazing
hoop
now
dropped
around
its
neck
a
shout
of
dismay
went
up
from
the
spectators
alf
nursing
his
burned
fingers
looked
scared
andy
glanced
sharply
after
the
flying
horse
and
spurted
after
it
at
that
moment
the
school
bell
rang
out
and
the
crowd
made
a
rush
in
the
direction
of
the
building
alf
warren
lagged
behind
go
ahead
directed
andy
i
catch
dobbin
ned
wilfer
at
that
moment
dashed
up
to
andy
side
i
stay
and
help
you
he
panted
do
be
tardy
do
get
into
trouble
said
andy
dobbin
was
making
straight
across
a
meadow
the
kerosene
soaked
rags
had
pretty
well
burned
out
they
smoked
still
however
and
in
the
breeze
once
in
a
while
a
tongue
of
flame
would
dart
forth
dobbin
passed
a
haystack
then
another
he
was
momentarily
shut
out
from
andy
view
on
both
occasions
at
his
second
reappearance
andy
noticed
that
the
animal
had
got
rid
of
the
hoop
dobbin
now
slackened
his
pace
snorted
and
laying
down
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
stubble
the
horse
righted
himself
as
andy
came
up
with
him
breathless
so
so
old
fellow
soothed
andy
just
singed
the
mane
a
little
that
all
he
patted
the
animal
nose
and
seized
the
bridle
to
lead
dobbin
back
to
the
pasture
from
which
he
had
started
oh
gracious
exclaimed
andy
abruptly
dropping
the
bridle
quicker
than
he
had
seized
it
forty
feet
back
on
the
course
dobbin
had
come
the
second
haystack
was
all
ablaze
there
the
horse
had
thrown
off
the
fire
hoop
or
it
had
burned
through
at
some
part
and
had
dropped
there
it
had
set
the
dry
hay
aflame
as
andy
looked
it
spread
out
into
a
blaze
enveloping
one
whole
side
of
the
stack
andy
was
dumb
with
consternation
however
he
was
not
the
boy
to
face
a
calamity
inactively
his
quick
eye
saw
that
the
stack
was
doomed
what
troubled
him
more
than
that
was
the
imminent
danger
to
other
stacks
nearly
adjoining
it
all
farmer
dale
hay
gasped
the
perturbed
lad
fifty
tons
if
there
one
if
all
that
goes
what
shall
i
do
andy
took
in
the
whole
situation
with
a
vivid
glance
then
he
made
a
dash
for
a
broken
stack
against
which
rested
a
large
field
rake
it
was
broad
and
had
a
very
long
handle
andy
ran
with
it
towards
the
blazing
heap
of
hay
and
set
to
work
instantly
this
wo
do
he
breathed
excitedly
as
an
effort
to
beat
out
the
spreading
flames
only
caused
burning
shreds
to
fill
the
air
these
threatened
to
ignite
the
contiguous
stacks
once
the
first
of
these
was
started
they
would
all
go
one
after
the
other
they
were
out
of
the
direct
draught
of
the
light
breeze
prevailing
what
cinders
arose
went
straight
up
high
in
the
air
the
main
danger
threatened
from
the
stubble
creeping
into
this
from
the
base
of
the
haystack
in
flames
little
pathways
of
fire
darted
out
like
vicious
serpents
andy
made
for
these
with
the
rake
he
beat
at
them
and
scraped
the
ground
he
stamped
with
his
stockinged
feet
and
pulled
up
clumps
of
stubble
with
his
hands
the
trouble
was
that
so
many
little
fires
started
up
at
so
many
different
spots
finally
however
the
ground
was
a
mass
of
grass
for
twenty
feet
clear
around
the
centre
of
the
blaze
the
haystack
was
sinking
down
a
glowing
mass
but
now
confined
itself
and
past
spreading
out
andy
flung
himself
on
the
ground
fairly
exhausted
his
hands
and
face
were
somewhat
blistered
and
he
was
wringing
wet
with
perspiration
he
looked
pretty
serious
as
he
did
a
sum
out
of
school
that
stack
held
about
two
tons
and
he
calculated
i
heard
a
farmer
at
the
say
yesterday
that
he
was
getting
eight
dollars
in
the
stack
for
hay
there
twenty
dollars
gone
up
in
smoke
where
will
i
ever
get
twenty
dollars
andy
became
more
and
more
despondent
the
longer
he
thought
of
the
dismal
situation
he
stirred
himself
to
action
with
the
rake
he
heaped
together
the
brittle
filaments
of
burned
hay
it
ca
spread
any
now
he
decided
finally
it
dying
down
to
nothing
now
then
what
next
andy
took
a
far
look
in
all
directions
the
fire
had
burned
so
rapidly
and
clear
in
the
crisp
light
air
that
it
did
not
seem
to
have
been
observed
in
the
village
andy
wondered
however
that
some
of
the
dales
had
not
discovered
it
he
stood
gazing
thoughtfully
at
the
dale
homestead
about
a
away
a
great
many
impulsive
disheartening
and
also
reckless
projects
ran
through
his
mind
it
an
awful
fix
to
be
in
ruminated
andy
with
a
sigh
of
real
distress
if
ever
it
was
up
to
a
fellow
to
cut
stick
and
run
it
up
to
andy
wildwood
at
this
minute
expelled
from
school
burning
up
a
man
haystack
and
then
aunt
lavinia
the
rest
is
bad
enough
but
when
i
think
of
her
it
sends
the
cold
chills
all
over
me
ugh
andy
looked
for
dobbin
it
was
some
time
before
he
discovered
the
innocent
partner
of
his
recent
disastrous
escapade
the
old
horse
was
distant
placidly
making
along
the
roadway
for
home
andy
rubbed
his
head
in
distress
and
uncertainty
he
had
a
hard
problem
to
figure
out
suddenly
his
eyes
snapped
and
he
straightened
up
briskly
i
wo
crawl
he
declared
the
mark
is
aunt
lavinia
great
motto
the
music
is
mine
i
wo
turn
tail
and
play
the
sneak
i
destroyed
some
property
well
the
first
honest
thing
to
do
is
to
try
and
make
good
here
goes
andy
started
for
the
road
he
reached
the
spot
where
he
had
left
his
coat
and
shoes
donning
these
he
went
to
a
little
pool
in
the
brush
washed
his
face
and
hands
and
made
a
short
cut
for
farmer
dale
house
andy
heart
was
beating
pretty
fast
as
he
entered
the
farm
yard
but
he
marched
straight
up
to
the
front
door
andy
knocked
first
timidly
then
louder
there
was
no
response
chapter
iv
a
business
proposition
nobody
at
home
said
andy
to
himself
he
walked
around
the
house
to
find
all
the
windows
closed
and
locked
that
the
reason
no
one
came
to
the
fire
he
resumed
somebody
though
andy
started
in
the
direction
of
the
barn
he
had
caught
the
sound
of
some
one
chopping
or
hammering
there
he
came
upon
a
hired
hand
splitting
some
sawed
hickory
slabs
to
whittle
down
into
skewers
dale
folks
all
away
inquired
andy
reckon
they
are
youngster
answered
the
man
will
they
be
gone
long

you
think
dale

he
drove
the
family
over
to
centreville
the
circus

said
andy
longingly
took
them
early
so
they
could
look
around
town
they
going
to
stay
all
night
with
some
relations
dale
is
though
he
ought
to
be

by
this
time

due
now
was
talking
of
carting
a
couple
of
loads
of
hay
over
to
gregson
this
morning
andy
heart
sank
at
this
he
did
not
tell
the
man
about
the
fire
backing
away
gloomily
he
went
out
into
the
road
again
every
point
in
the
landscape
suggested
some
section
of
his
misfortunes
andy
craned
his
neck
as
he
took
in
a
distant
view
of
the
old
he
made
out
a
female
figure
approaching
it
andy
recognized
the
green
bombazine
dress
of
miss
lavinia
talcott
she
carried
a
baggy
umbrella
in
her
hand
andy
from
experience
knew
that
its
possession
by
the
old
maid
was
generally
a
sign
that
she
was
on
the
she
hunting
for
me
thought
andy
i
suppose
i
got
to
face
the
music
some
time
but
i
not
do
it
just
now
i
got
some
business
to
attend
to
first
andy
hurried
down
the
centreville
turnpike
he
walked
along
briskly
more
to
get
out
of
possible
range
of
miss
lavinia
than
with
any
other
distinct
motive
in
mind
still
andy
had
business
in
view
that
burned
down
haystack
haunted
him
somehow
he
must
square
himself
with
dale
he
said
he
fancied
he
had
found
a
way
andy
did
not
pause
until
he
was
fully
a
mile
down
the
highway
he
felt
safe
from
interruption
now
and
sat
down
on
an
old
log
and
mused
in
a
dreamy
drifting
sort
of
a
way
the
sound
of
approaching
wagon
wheels
disturbed
him
in
the
midst
of
a
depressing
reverie
it
dale
said
andy
getting
up
from
the
log
and
viewing
the
approaching
team
i
wanted
to
see
you
dale
he
spoke
aloud
as
the
came
abreast
of
him
oh
hello
you
wildwood
spoke
the
farmer
with
a
grin
playing
hookey
eh
no
sir
answered
andy
frankly
i
was
expelled
from
school
this
morning
do
tell
me
now
said
dale
want
a
lift
no
sir
answered
andy
i
just
wanted
to
take
up
a
minute
of
your
time
i
sorry
dale
i
do
suppose
you
think
any
too
much
of
me
already
and
when
i
tell
you
hey
ha
ha
chuckled
dale
think
i
sore
on
you
because
of
that
calf
business
not
at
all
not
at
all
why
i
got
double
price
for
the
critter
see
there
something
else
announced
andy
seriously
the
truth
is
dale
i
burned
down
one
of
your
haystacks
about
an
hour
ago
what
you
burned
one
of
my
haystacks
which
one
which
one
demanded
dale
growing
pale
with
excitement
the
little
one
to
the
of
the
field
explained
andy
i
should
think
it
held
between
two
and
three
tons
farmer
dale
dropped
the
lines
and
jumped
down
into
the
road
from
the
wagon
whip
in
hand
all
his
jubilant
slyness
deserted
him
he
began
to
get
frightfully
worked
up
over
andy
news
wait
a
minute
pleaded
andy
do
get
excited
till
i
explain
i
managed
to
save
the
other
stacks
it
was
all
an
accident
but
i
want
to
pay
the
damage
yes
i
pay
you
mr
dale
you
have
to
you
bet
on
that
snorted
the
farmer
wrathfully
go
to
your
aunt
right
off
with
the
bill
do
do
it
dale
advised
andy
she
preaches
lots
about
honesty
and
responsibility
and
all
that
but
she
mighty
close
when
it
comes
to
the
dollars
she
would
pay
you
a
cent
no
sir
but
i
will
that
hay
is
worth
about
twenty
dollars
i
reckon
mr
dale
well
yes
it
is
nodded
the
farmer
good
timothy
is
scarce
and
that
was
a
prime
lot
i
got
no
money
of
course
went
on
andy
but
i
thought
this
could
you
give
me
some
work
to
do
and
let
me
pay
it
out
in
that
way
i
do
my
level
best
to
oh
that
your
precious
proposition
is
it
snarled
dale
switching
the
whip
about
furiously
no
i
could
the
hand
i
got
now
is
idle
half
the
time
see
here
wildwood
arson
is
a
pretty
serious
crime
you
better
square
this
thing
some
way
in
fact
you
got
to
do
it
or
there
going
to
be
trouble
i
know
what
you
mean
said
andy
you
have
me
arrested
you
do
that
dale
i
feel
bad
enough
i
in
a
hard
enough
corner
already
i
want
to
do
what
right
and
i
intend
to
i
owe
you
twenty
dollars
will
you
give
me
time
to
pay
it
in
will
you
take
my
note
with
interest
of
course
for
the
amount
will
i
take
your
note
interest
ha
ha
oh
dear
me
dear
me
fairly
exploded
dale
in
a
burst
of
uproarious
laughter
secured
added
andy
in
a
tone
secured
by
what
demanded
dale
eagerly
i
ca
tell
you
now
i
will
or
morning
you
do
mean
old
ball
bats
or
your
mud
scow
in
the
creek
or
that
kind
of
trash
inquired
dale
suspiciously
no
sir
i
mean
tangible
security
declared
andy
you
do
seem
to
carry
much
of
it
around
with
you
suggested
dale
bluntly
casting
a
sarcastic
eye
over
andy
clothes
perhaps
not
admitted
andy
coloring
up
i
can
give
you
security
though
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
if
i
can
place
good
security
in
the
hands
of
a
trusty
person
will
you
give
me
say
three
months
to
pay
you
off
in
if
i
do
the
person
will
sell
the
security
and
pay
you
in
full
why
do
you
put
the
security
in
my
hands
asked
the
farmer
shrewdly
because
i
have
done
some
damage
up
at
the
schoolhouse
i
want
to
pay
for
that
too
you
will
be
satisfied
with
the
security
and
the
person
holding
it
dale
i
will
let
you
know
all
about
it
before
ten
morning
farmer
dale
surveyed
andy
with
a
long
curious
stare
whistling
softly
to
himself
his
hot
temper
was
subdued
now
that
he
saw
a
prospect
of
payment
for
the
burned
hay
you
talk
straight
off
the
reel
wildwood
he
said
i
believe
honest
go
on
with
your
little
arrangement
and
let
see
how
it
pans
out
i
sha
make
any
move

dale
said
andy
i
wo

andy
started
to
move
away
from
the
spot
hold
on
interrupted
dale

me
how
it
happened
andy
gave
an
unbiased
account
of
the
morning
occurrences
ha
hum
commented
the
farmer
no
end
of
scrapes
because
you
a
lively
lad
and
ca
help
it

here
wildwood
do
you
know
what
i
would
do
if

your
place

mr
dale
asked
andy
i
join
the
show
yes
i
would
declared
the
farmer
energetically
i
tell
you
i
believe
circus
is
born
in
you
and
you
ca

it
you
do
have
much
of
a
life
at
home
you
not
built
for
humdrum
village
life
get
out
grow
into
something
you
fancy
no
need
being
a
scamp
because
you
a
rover
my
brother
was
built
your
sort
they
pinned
him
down
trying
to
make
a
doctor
of
him
and
he
ran
away
he
turned
up
with
a
little
fortune
ten
years
later
a
happy
fellow
no
one
particularly
knew
it
but
he
been
with
a
traveling
minstrel
show
for
those
ten
years
now
he
settled
down
and
i
like
to
see
a
finer
man
than
zeb
dale
thank
you
said
andy
i
think
of
what
you
say
farmer
dale
jogged
on
his
way
andy
faced
towards
centreville
it
seemed
as
if
something
was
pulling
him
along
in
that
direction
chapter
v
the
circus
at
the
first
a
field
wagon
containing
a
farmer
his
wife
and
children
whirled
into
andy
wildwood
view
a
merry
juvenile
chorus
told
andy
that
they
were
bound
for
the
circus
trace
loose
mister
he
called
out
as
he
noticed
the
trailing
strap
whoa
ordered
the
driver
halting
with
a
jolt
and
andy
adjusted
the
faulty
harness
and
smiled
back
cheerily
at
an
eager
little
fellow
in
the
wagon
who
inquired
if
he
was
going
to
the
show
too
jump
in
youngster
if
ours
is
your
way
invited
the
farmer
andy
promptly
availed
himself
of
the
offer
he
sat
with
his
feet
dangling
over
the
tailboard
the
farther
he
got
from
fairview
the
less
he
thought
of
the
manifold
troubles
and
complications
he
was
leaving
behind
him
there
andy
did
not
intend
to
run
away
from
home
he
had
business
in
view
which
demanded
his
presence
in
fairview
the
next
day
he
was
however
resolved
to
go
to
centreville
he
would
at
least
see
the
outside
of
the
circus
and
could
put
on
the
time
until
evening
it
was
only
six
miles
from
fairview
to
centreville
and
they
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
county
seat
andy
caught
more
and
more
of
the
circus
fever
as
they
progressed
at
every
branch
road
a
new
string
of
vehicles
joined
the
procession
they
passed
gay
parties
of
ruralites
on
foot
andy
leaped
down
from
the
wagon
with
a
thank
you
to
his
host
at
the
first
sight
of
the
mammoth
white
tents
over
on
the
village
common
this
was
the
second
day
of
the
circus
at
centreville
it
was
scheduled
to
remain
one
more
day
its
coming
was
a
great
event
for
the
town
and
the
place
was
crowded
with
andy
reached
the
principal
street
just
as
the
grand
pageant
went
by
it
was
a
spectacle
that
dazzled
him
the
music
the
glitter
the
pomp
the
fair
array
of
wild
animals
made
him
forget
everything
except
that
he
was
a
boy
enjoying
a
rare
moment
of
existence
it
was
the
inner
life
of
the
circus
people
however
that
attracted
andy
it
was
his
great
ambition
to
be
one
of
them
he
was
not
content
to
remain
a
spectator
of
the
outside
veneer
of
show
life
he
wanted
to
know
something
of
its
practical
side
andy
did
not
dally
around
the
ticket
seller
booth
the
side
shows
or
the
crowded
main
entrance
of
the
show
once
when
a
small
circus
had
visited
fairview
he
had
gotten
a
free
pass
by
carrying
buckets
of
water
to
the
cook
tent
he
had
now
a
vague
hope
that
some
such
fortunate
chance
might
turn
up
on
this
new
occasion
andy
soon
discovered
however
that
the
present
layout
was
on
a
far
different
scale
to
the
show
he
had
seen
at
fairview
it
was
a
city
in
itself
there
were
bounds
as
to
the
circus
proper
ropes
strung
along
iron
stakes
driven
into
the
ground
kept
curious
visitors
at
a
distance
the
performers
tent
the
horse
tents
the
cook
quarters
and
the
sleeping
space
of
the
working
hands
were
all
guarded
and
intruders
warned
to
keep
their
distance
everything
was
neat
and
clean
and
a
system
prevailed
everywhere
the
savory
flavor
of
roasting
meat
made
andy
desperately
hungry
he
saw
a
fat
aproned
cook
hastily
gathering
up
some
chips
near
a
chopping
block
andy
offered
to
split
him
some
fresh
wood
but
received
only
an
ungracious
get
out
no
trespassers
allowed
here
andy
wandered
about
for
a
long
time
he
greatly
envied
a
lad
about
his
own
age
who
adorned
with
a
jacket
was
walking
a
beautiful
arabian
steed
up
and
down
while
he
was
staring
at
the
circus
boy
two
popcorn
boys
connected
with
the
show
ran
into
him
purposely
and
tripped
him
up
they
went
off
with
a
laugh
at
his
mishap
andy
concluded
he
was
getting
in
the
way
as
a
gruff
grizzled
old
fellow
with
a
bludgeon
ran
forward
and
yelled
to
him
to
make
himself
scarce
i
wish
i
could
get
into
the
show
murmured
andy
there
seems
no
way
to
work
it
though
he
added
disconsolately
i
wonder
if
they
let
me
stay
here
when
that
canvas
flaps
i
can
see
right
into
the
main
tent
andy
was
right
near
the
canvassed
passageway
leading
from
the
performers
tent
to
the
main
one
if
no
one
disturbed
him
he
could
have
occasional
glimpses
of
what
was
going
on
inside
and
that
was
better
than
nothing
fate
however
was
against
him
he
heard
quick
breathing
and
turning
saw
the
big
watchman
rapidly
making
for
him
club
uplifted
trying
to
get
in
under
the
canvas
eh
roared
the
man
not
i
i
would
steal
anything
not
even
a
sneak
into
the
show
declared
andy
he
retreated
promptly
but
in
doing
so
tripped
over
a
guy
rope
and
went
flat
andy
got
up
his
mouth
full
of
fine
shavings
but
grasping
something
his
hand
had
come
in
contact
with
and
had
clutched
in
his
fall
he
ran
out
of
range
of
the
watchman
who
brandished
his
stick
at
the
lad
threateningly
at
a
safe
distance
andy
inspected
his
find
only
a
handkerchief
he
said
and
a
rather
mussy
one
at
that
but
there
something
knotted
in
it
i
wonder
what
it
is
it
was
a
large
silk
handkerchief
it
had
an
odor
of
resin
and
two
of
its
corners
were
knotted
untying
one
knot
andy
disclosed
a
mysterious
device
resembling
two
hard
rubber
shoe
horns
joined
in
the
centre
by
a
concave
piece
of
metal
he
could
not
possibly
imagine
its
use
or
value
then
andy
laughed
outright
the
other
knot
undone
revealed
a
small
rabbit
foot
not
much
of
a
find
he
ruminated
queer
kind
of
plunder
though
wonder
who
owns
it
and
what
that
fandangle
thing
is
andy
pocketed
the
find
and
was
about
to
move
away
from
the
spot
when
the
flap
of
the
performers
tent
moved
apart
a
man
came
out
all
arrayed
in
tights
and
spangles
for
the
circus
ring
he
wore
a
loose
robe
over
his
show
costume
and
big
slippers
on
his
feet
his
hair
was
nicely
combed
and
his
face
powdered
up
for
the
performance
he
looked
very
anxious
and
excited
andy
at
once
saw
that
he
was
looking
for
something
in
great
haste
and
suspense
the
man
walked
all
around
outside
of
the
performers
tent
eagerly
scanning
the
ground
then
he
enlarged
the
scope
of
his
survey
and
search
hey
marco
sang
out
another
man
sticking
his
head
past
the
flap
of
the
tent
time
to
get
in
line
wait
a
minute
retorted
the
other
i
lost
something
and
i
go
on
till
i
find
it
the
speaker
looked
positively
distressed
as
he
continued
a
disappointing
search
a
sudden
idea
struck
andy
and
he
drew
the
handkerchief
and
its
belongings
from
his
pocket
just
then
the
circus
performer
nearly
ran
against
him
he
looked
up
and
made
a
forward
jump
he
seized
the
handkerchief
and
the
two
odd
objects
it
contained
with
a
fervent
cry
that
astonished
the
bewildered
andy
give
them
to
me
he
exclaimed
eagerly
they
mine
where
did
you
find
them
boy
you
saved
my
life
chapter
vi
circus
talk
andy
knew
that
the
circus
actor
vehement
statement
was
an
exaggeration
still
there
was
no
doubting
the
fact
that
he
was
intensely
pleased
and
grateful
i
found
those
things
in
the
handkerchief
over
near
the
dressing
tent
explained
andy
i
must
have
dropped
them
there
or
they
got
kicked
out
under
the
flap
in
hustling
the
baggage
around
cried
the
man
here
kid
the
speaker
made
a
motion
towards
his
side
as
if
reaching
for
a
vest
pocket
i
forgot
he
laughed
i
have
my
ring
togs
on
come
along
i
borrow
some
coin
for
you
oh

andy

the
man
in
astonishment
i
want
to
do
something
for
you
i
the
man
with
the
iron
jaw
and
that
hard
rubber
device
is
what
i
hold
in
my
mouth
when
i
go
up
the
rope

and
that
rabbit
foot
insinuated
andy
guessing
hoodoo
do
grin
kid
if
you
were
in
the
profession
you
understand
that
a
fellow
values
a
charm
that
has
carried
him
safe
over
fridays
thirteenths
rotten
trapezes
and
cyclones

a
superstitious
bunch

admitted
andy
with
alacrity
if
it
can
be
arranged
come
with
me
yes

andy
readily
followed
after
his
gymnastic
acquaintance
a
word
at
the
door
flap
of
the
performers
tent
admitted
them
without
challenge
andy
took
a
keen
interested
look
around
near
two
stands
holding
silver
starred
boxes
was
a
performer
in
costume
evidently
the
conjurer
of
the
show
beyond
him
seated
daintily
on
a
large
white
horse
was
a
pretty
woman
of
about
thirty
waiting
her
call
to
the
ring
a
fellow
sat
on
a
stool
surrounded
by
enormous
balls
and
dumb
bells
the
strong
man
of
the
circus
a
trick
elephant
was
being
fed
by
its
keeper
at
once
side
of
the
tent
nearby
was
a
young
man
dressed
as
a
jockey
holding
the
chains
leading
to
the
collars
of
a
dozen
performing
dogs
andy
had
a
good
memory
he
knew
from
her
resemblance
to
the
posters
he
had
seen
that
the
lady
on
the
white
horse
was
miss
stella
starr
the
dashing
equestrienne
she
seemed
to
be
on
good
terms
with
everybody
particularly
with
new
acquaintance
who
is
your
friend
marco
she
asked
as
the
man
passed
by
her
he
explained
with
a
great
many
excited
gestures
then
he
beckoned
to
andy
as
the
equestrienne
smiled
pleasantly
at
him
you
bunk
right
there
kid
said
marco
stowing
andy
behind
a
pile
of
seat
planks
that
lined
the
side
of
the
canvassed
passageway
joining
the
performers
tent
with
the
main
one
andy
promptly
climbed
up
on
top
of
the
heap
of
boards
the
curtain
that
separated
the
two
circus
compartments
was
festooned
at
one
side
just
beyond
was
the
orchestra
andy
could
look
over
their
heads
and
past
them
with
a
perfect
view
of
the
performing
ring
he
gave
himself
up
so
completely
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
grand
privilege
accorded
him
that
for
one
engrossing
bewildering
hour
he
seemed
in
a
dreamland
of
rare
delight
everything
went
smoothly
and
neatly
the
various
acts
were
new
and
cleverly
performed
when
it
came
to
stella
starr
turn
andy
witnessed
a
second
exhibition
of
the
superstitious
folly
of
these
strange
circus
folk
the
equestrienne
sharply
halted
the
man
who
led
her
horse
forward
for
a
dash
into
the
ring
back
him
instantly
she
called
out
right
foot
first
over
the
dead
line
i
would
start
on
a
left
foot
for
the
whole
proceeds
the
imperious
mandate
was
obeyed
and
andy
raptly
witnessed
some
bareback
riding
that
made
his
heart
quicken
and
his
eyes
flash
with
pleasure
and
admiration
miss
stella
starr
had
two
acts
when
she
retired
from
the
ring
kissing
her
little
hands
prettily
to
the
applauding
audience
the
manager
turned
her
horse
again
facing
the
curtain
in
the
canvassed
passageway
the
equestrienne
sank
gracefully
to
a
rest
on
the
flank
of
the
big
white
horse
patting
him
affectionately
while
some
hands
began
rolling
great
tubs
into
the
ring
these
were
to
form
a
pyramid
up
one
side
of
which
and
down
the
other
the
white
horse
was
to
pass
suddenly
as
andy
interest
was
divided
between
the
ring
and
the
equestrienne
a
sharp
crack
rang
out
it
was
accompanied
by
a
swishing
ominous
tearing
sound
an
uneasy
murmur
swayed
the
audience
the
manager
ran
out
into
the
ring
swiftly
glanced
at
the
centre
pole
and
drawing
a
whistle
from
his
pocket
gave
three
piercing
blasts
it
a
wind
storm
andy
heard
some
one
remark
a
second
gust
swayed
the
centre
pole
the
great
spreads
of
canvas
bulged
and
flapped
the
audience
arose
in
their
seats
andy
saw
the
manager
seize
a
great
megaphone
near
the
band
stand
he
shouted
preserve
order
there
is
no
danger
keep
your
seats
it
is
only
a
passing
gust
of
wind
play
play
he
shouted
frantically
to
the
band
take
care
shouted
the
man
marco
with
a
look
through
the
outside
flap
she
coming
again
a
sudden
tumult
fell
on
the
air
shrieks
yells
a
great
babel
arose
from
the
audience
the
centre
pole
creaked
and
swayed
dangerously
then
with
a
sharp
rip
the
canvas
roof
over
andy
head
was
wrenched
from
place
and
went
sailing
up
into
the
air
a
heavy
wooden
running
between
two
supports
had
been
torn
loose
at
one
end
the
rope
securing
it
whipped
about
and
struck
andy
in
the
face
he
dodged
and
was
about
to
leap
to
the
ground
when
a
sharp
cry
from
stella
starr
announced
a
new
peril
the
free
end
of
the
heavy
cross
piece
was
descending
with
the
force
of
a
driven
sledge
hammer
she
was
directly
within
range
andy
saw
her
danger
jumped
erect
grabbed
at
the
rope
whipping
about
and
pulled
it
towards
himself
as
the
equestrienne
shrank
to
the
neck
of
the
trembling
horse
upon
which
she
sat
the
timber
just
grazed
her
spangled
hair
it
struck
the
ground
and
tore
loose
above
its
other
end
hit
the
pile
of
seat
planks
with
a
crash
andy
felt
them
topple
he
tried
to
steady
himself
to
jump
aside
he
was
caught
in
the
tumble
and
went
headlong
to
the
sawdust
the
planks
falling
on
top
of
him
chapter
vii
a
warm
reception
andy
wildwood
was
knocked
senseless
when
he
came
back
to
consciousness
he
found
himself
lying
on
a
mattress
in
a
little
space
surrounded
by
canvas
it
was
one
of
the
circus
dressing
rooms
he
sniffed
camphor
and
one
side
of
his
head
felt
stiff
and
sore
putting
up
his
hand
andy
discovered
strips
of
sticking
plaster
there
was
i
hurt
he
asked
sitting
up
circus
doctor
says
not
badly
promptly
answered
marco
who
stood
by
the
mattress
how
is
it
kid
no
bones
broken
oh
no
answered
andy
readily
getting
to
his
feet
say
what
happened
the
wind
storm
gone
over
it
sunshine
outside
now
a
few
hanks
of
thread
will
fix
the
rips
the
show
went
on
all
right
after
the
squall
but
say
you
a
daisy
that
timber
oh
here
she
is
to
talk
for
herself
miss
stella
starr
put
in
an
appearance
just
here
she
was
neatly
dressed
in
street
costume
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
there
was
a
grateful
smile
on
her
womanly
face
as
she
grasped
both
of
andy
hands
you
are
a
good
boy
she
said
with
enthusiasm
bring
me
a
stool
marco
i
want
to
talk
with
him
andy
flushed
with
embarrassment
as
the
little
lady
went
on
to
insist
that
but
for
his
quick
foresight
and
energy
she
might
have
missed
her
salary
lying
in
a
hospital
for
many
a
long
day
she
was
very
anxious
as
to
andy
injuries
and
looked
greatly
relieved
to
find
them
trifling
just
a
lump
under
the
ear
and
a
cut
on
one
cheek
reported
andy
indifferently
they
worth
having
to
see
you
ride
miss
there
marco
cried
the
equestrienne
brightly
that
is
the
handsomest
compliment
i
ever
received
the
kid
a
mascot
pronounced
marco
in
his
heavy
earnest
way
he
found
my
lost
traps
and
he
maybe
saved
your
life
what
can
we
do
for
you
now
andy
shook
his
head
vaguely
his
bright
face
clouded
the
human
sympathy
of
his
new
friends
had
warmed
his
heart
it
chilled
as
he
thought
of
fairview
and
what
awaited
him
there
especially
aunt
lavinia
the
quick
witted
equestrienne
read
his
face
like
a
book
see
here

she
said
laying
her
gloved
hand
winningly
on
sleeve

andy
told
his
story
stella
starr
laughed
merrily
at
his
mild
escapades
marco
big
eyes
opened
widely
as
andy
made
plain
the
fact
that
he
was
a
very
fair
amateur
acrobat
why
the
kid
is
up
to
the
trained
average
if
he
can
do
all
those
things

declared
stella
starr
studied
andy
silently
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
said
andy

truthful

to
the
manager
and
ask
him
to

on
with
the
show
tears
of
longing
and
gratefulness
came
to
andy
eyes
he
could
not
stop
them
you

good
kind
people
he
said
in
a
muffled
tone
if
i
never
see
you
again
i
shall
never
forget
you
stella
starr
kissed
andy
on
the
cheek
in
a
motherly
way
marco
followed
the
boy
outside
he
thumped
him
on
the
back
with
the
farewell
words
uttered
with
emphasis
cut
for
it
kid
take
my
advice
it
good
you
got
the
making
of
a
ringer
in
you
do
waste
your
ability
in
that
humdrum
town
of
yours
andy
started
for
fairview
in
a
daze
so
much
had
happened
since
morning
that
he
could
recall
it
all
only
in
a
series
of
long
mental
pictures
the
kindness
and
suggestions
of
his
friends
kept
him
thinking
deeply
it
was
nearly
dusk
when
andy
entered
fairview
he
steered
clear
of
old
comrades
and
familiar
haunts
when
he
reached
home
it
was
by
way
of
the
rear
fence
a
light
shone
in
the
little
kitchen
his
aunt
was
bustling
about
in
a
brisk
jumpy
way
that
told
andy
she
was
full
of
excitement
and
wrath
here
goes
anyway
he
said
finally
vaulting
the
fence
and
reaching
the
woodshed
andy
took
up
a
good
armful
of
wood
marched
right
up
to
the
back
steps
and
through
the
open
doorway
he
placed
his
load
behind
the
kitchen
stove
you
graceless
wretch
were
miss
lavinia
first
words
she
had
a
cooking
fork
in
her
hand
and
with
it
she
jabbed
the
air
viciously
go
up
stairs
instantly
she
commanded
next
i
not
sleepy
and
i
hungry
said
andy
respectfully
enough
but
firmly
he
walked
over
to
the
set
table
and
picked
up
two
biscuits
from
a
plate
put
those
down
you
put
those
down
screamed
miss
lavinia
will
you
mind
me
andy
pocketed
the
biscuits
he
was
taking
wise
precautions
in
view
of
past
experiences
with
his
termagant
relative
the
boy
stood
his
ground
and
his
aunt
stamped
her
foot
then
she
reached
behind
the
stove
and
took
up
a
stick
used
as
a
carpet
beater
armed
with
this
she
advanced
threateningly
upon
andy
do
strike
me
aunt
lavinia
said
andy
quickly
i
am
getting
too
big
for
that
i
wo
stand
it
you
scamp
you
disgrace
shouted
his
irate
relative
still
advancing
upon
him
she
beat
at
andy
who
snatched
the
stick
from
her
hand
broke
it
in
two
and
threw
it
out
through
the
open
doorway
i
will
go
to
my
room
if
you
insist
upon
it
said
andy
now
i
see
the
need
of
treating
me
like
a
dog
though
do
you
screamed
miss
lavinia
oh
you
precious
rascal
here
worked
my
fingers
off
to
keep
you
respectable
and
you
go
and
disgrace
me
shamefully
go
to
your
room
andy
wildwood
we
attend
to
this
matter
of
yours
in
the
morning
what
matter
demanded
andy
never
mind
now
do
as
i
say
there
a
rod
in
pickle
for
you
young
man
that
may
bring
you
to
your
senses
this
time
andy
preferred
loneliness
up
stairs
to
nagging
down
stairs
he
left
the
kitchen
and
reached
his
own
room
he
lit
a
candle
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
there
was
a
sharp
click
at
the
door
almost
immediately
his
aunt
had
stolen
silently
up
the
stairs
and
had
bolted
him
in
as
if
that
would
keep
me
if
i
wanted
to
get
out
very
bad
thought
andy
with
a
glance
at
the
frail
door
oh
but
i
tired
of
all
this
i
made
up
my
mind
i
shall
leave
fairview
andy
went
to
a
shelf
felt
in
an
old
vase
and
took
out
a
key
he
fitted
it
to
the
lower
drawer
of
the
bureau
in
the
room
it
was
full
of
old
clothes
and
papers
that
had
belonged
to
his
father
finally
andy
unearthed
a
little
wooden
box
and
lifted
it
to
the
light
it
held
a
lot
of
trinkets
and
from
among
them
andy
selected
a
large
silver
watch
and
chain
he
also
took
out
a
small
box
it
was
made
of
some
very
dark
smooth
wood
and
its
corners
and
center
were
decorated
with
carved
pieces
of
gold
and
mother
of
pearl
the
watch
and
chain
are
solid
silver
murmured
andy
the
box
was
given
to
father
by
his
father
it
is
made
of
some
rare
wood
that
grows
in
the
south
sea
islands
the
gold
on
it
is
quite
thick
i
am
sure
the
bare
metal
on
those
things
is
worth
more
than
thirty
dollars
andy
carefully
stowed
the
watch
and
little
box
in
an
inner
pocket
then
he
lay
down
on
the
bed
to
think
but
without
removing
any
of
his
clothing
he
silently
munched
the
biscuits
his
face
cleared
as
reflection
led
to
determination
andy
planned
to
leave
the
house
as
soon
as
it
was
closed
up
for
the
night
and
aunt
lavinia
was
asleep
i
ca
stand
it
he
decided
she
says
i
a
burden
to
her
i
got
a
show
to
enjoy
myself
and
maybe
make
some
money
yes
it
centreville
and
the
circus
by
morning
andy
was
more
tired
out
than
he
had
fancied
he
fell
asleep
as
he
woke
up
he
discovered
that
heavy
footsteps
tramping
up
the
stairs
had
aroused
him
he
had
caught
the
echo
of
lighter
feet
there
was
rustling
in
the
narrow
entry
outside
andy
sprang
up
and
listened
intently
aunt
lavinia
and
some
one
with
her
he
reflected
i
wonder
who
it
can
be
just
then
a
gruff
voice
spoke
out
is
the
boy
in
that
room
miss
lavinia

said
andy
aunt
then
have
him
out
and

unpleasant
duty
over

viii
coasting
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
andy
candle
had
remained
lighted
as
the
door
was
pushed
open
andy
saw
a
big
portly
man
standing
behind
his
aunt
put
on
your
clothes
andy
wildwood
began

nodded
andy
staring
hard
he
recognized
the
speaker
as
dan
wagner
the
village
constable
instantly
the
truth
flashed
over
andy
he
turned
to
his
aunt
with
a
pale
stern
face

to
let
this
man
take
me
to
jail
he
demanded

little
too

andy
wildwood

andy
indignantly

the
charge
against

the
constable
with
a
laugh

be
a
specific

scornfully

dozen

andy

the
constable

the
angry
spinster
my
duty
is
to
keep
this
boy
from
going
to
ruin
you
do
yours
i
explained
it
all
to
the
judge
he
said
that
if
i
as
his
guardian
swore
andy
was
an
incorrigible
unmanageable
boy
he
would
send
him
to
the
parental
school
at
byron
till
he
was
reformed
andy
grew
white
to
the
lips
he
fixed
such
a
glance
on
his
aunt
that
she
quailed
shame
on
you
he
burst
forth
you
my
guardian
what
did
you
ever
guard
for
me
except
too
little
clothes
and
victuals
i
never
out
of
the
house
after
dark
i
never
refuse
to
do
your
hardest
work
i
even
scrub
for
you
well
i
wo
any
longer
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
go
away
you
hear
that
you
hear
that
cried
miss
lavinia
he
going
to
run
away
from
home
home
retorted
andy
scornfully
a
fine
home
this
has
been
for
me
snapped
at
found
fault
with
treated
like
a
charity
pauper
do
your
duty
wagner
but
i
warn
you
that
no
law
can
send
me
to
the
reform
school
this
woman
is
not
my
legal
guardian
she
is
not
rightfully
even
a
relative
i
have
friends
in
fairview
i
tell
you
and
they
wo
see
me
wronged
i
wonder
what
my
poor
dead
father
would
say
to
you
for
all
this
miss
lavinia
gave
a
shriek
she
fell
into
a
chair
and
kicked
her
heels
on
the
floor
and
went
into
hysterics
the
constable
looked
in
a
friendly
way
at
andy
he
liked
the
lad
pluck
and
independence
he
recalled
too
how
andy
had
once
led
him
to
a
quiet
haystack
where
he
had
slept
himself
sober
instead
of
risking
his
position
and
making
a
public
show
of
himself
on
the
streets
of
fairview
see
here
miss
lavinia
he
spoke
i
do
fancy
treating
andy
like
a
criminal
if
i
take
him
with
me
now
i
have
to
lock
him
up
with
two
chicken
thieves
and
a
tramp
they
no
good
company
for
a
homebred
boy
he
deserves
a
lesson
declared
miss
lavinia
he
shall
have
it
too
let
him
stay
here
till
morning
then
i
come
after
him
he
wo
be
here
did
you
hear
him
say
he
was
going
to
run
away
from
home
have
you
got
some
safe
place
i
can
lock
him
up
in
suggested
wagner
i
got
to
make
you
safe
and
sound
you
know
observed
the
officer
quite
apologetically
to
andy
yes
there
is
reported
miss
lavinia
after
brief
thought
you
wait
a
minute
she
went
away
and
returned
with
a
bunch
of
keys
the
constable
beckoned
to
andy
to
follow
her
and
he
closed
in
behind
a
steep
narrow
staircase
led
to
an
attic
room
at
the
extreme
rear
of
the
house
this
as
andy
knew
was
his
aunt
strong
room
it
had
a
heavy
door
secured
by
a
padlock
and
only
one
window
as
miss
lavinia
unlocked
the
door
and
the
candle
illuminated
the
interior
of
the
apartment
the
constable
observed
grimly
i
reckon
this
will
keep
him
safe
and
sound
andy
said
nothing
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
and
considered
further
talk
useless
the
apartment
was
littered
up
with
chests
barrels
and
old
furniture
in
one
corner
was
a
pile
of
carpets
andy
walked
silently
over
to
these
threw
himself
down
and
found
himself
in
darkness
as
the
door
was
again
stoutly
padlocked
on
the
outside
if
anybody
cared
for
me
here
it
might
be
different
he
observed
as
they
do
i
must
make
friends
for
myself
in
about
half
an
hour
andy
went
to
the
window
it
was
a
small
sash
looking
out
he
could
trace
the
reflection
from
a
light
in
his
aunt
room
on
the
shrubbery
finally
this
light
was
extinguished
andy
waited
a
full
hour
he
heard
the
town
bell
strike
twelve
the
lad
took
out
his
pocket
knife
opened
its
big
blade
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
pried
off
the
strip
lining
the
sash
he
removed
the
pane
and
set
it
noiselessly
on
the
floor
as
he
stuck
his
head
out
through
the
aperture
andy
looked
calculating
and
serious
it
was
fully
thirty
feet
to
the
ground
and
no
friendly
projection
offered
help
in
a
descent
it
was
furthermore
a
question
if
he
could
even
squeeze
through
the
window
space
andy
had
nothing
to
make
a
rope
of
the
old
pieces
of
carpet
could
not
be
utilized
in
any
way
if
he
could
force
his
body
through
the
window
head
first
it
was
a
dive
to
go
feet
first
on
a
dangerous
drop
andy
investigated
the
aperture
experimented
took
in
the
situation
in
all
its
various
phases
finally
he
decided
what
he
would
do
he
had
unearthed
a
long
ironing
board
from
a
corner
of
the
room
he
pulled
a
heavy
dresser
up
to
the
window
and
opened
one
of
its
drawers
a
few
inches
by
slanting
the
ironing
board
he
managed
to
get
its
broad
end
out
through
the
window
then
he
dropped
it
flat
with
its
narrow
end
held
firmly
under
the
projecting
drawer
andy
got
flat
on
the
board
squirmed
along
it
and
just
managed
to
squeeze
through
the
window
space
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
he
found
himself
extended
outside
on
the
board
a
touch
might
throw
it
out
of
position
and
drop
him
like
a
shot
very
carefully
he
arose
to
his
feet
and
backed
against
the
clapboards
of
the
house
andy
felt
sideways
and
up
over
his
head
he
soon
located
what
he
knew
to
be
there
two
lightning
rod
staples
the
rod
itself
had
rusted
away
the
staples
had
been
used
to
hold
up
a
vine
this
drew
bugs
miss
lavinia
declared
and
had
been
torn
down
andy
hooked
his
finger
around
one
of
the
staples
he
got
one
foot
on
the
window
sill
clear
of
the
board
the
other
foot
he
lifted
in
the
air
stooping
and
getting
a
hold
on
the
side
of
the
ironing
board
andy
gently
slid
it
out
from
its
holding
place
and
upright
he
brought
it
and
himself
erect
moving
up
his
hand
he
transferred
its
grasp
to
the
second
iron
staple
higher
up
the
side
of
the
house
now
andy
rested
the
board
on
his
toes
he
clasped
it
like
a
shield
against
his
body
its
broad
end
nearest
his
face
beyond
its
edge
he
took
a
keen
glance
the
moon
shone
brightly
the
nearest
object
it
showed
was
a
high
thorn
apple
tree
it
stood
about
twelve
feet
from
the
house
and
its
top
was
perhaps
as
far
below
his
foothold
it
my
only
show
said
andy
i
got
to
coast
it
or
get
all
torn
up
he
let
go
his
hold
of
the
staple
instantly
he
had
a
hand
firmly
grasping
either
side
of
the
ironing
board
andy
dropped
to
a
slant
giving
his
feet
a
prodigious
push
against
the
window
sill
he
shot
forward
and
downward
for
an
instant
andy
sailed
through
the
air
he
feared
he
might
dive
short
of
the
tree
he
hoped
he
would
land
flat
the
latter
by
luck
or
his
own
precision
he
did
the
board
struck
the
tree
top
there
was
a
sliding
swish
a
vast
cracking
of
branches
his
weight
dropped
one
end
of
the
ironing
board
it
landed
against
a
big
branch
and
andy
found
himself
safely
anchored
in
the
tree
top
chapter
ix
to
fairview
looking
back
at
the
attic
window
andy
wildwood
wondered
how
he
had
ever
made
the
successful
descent
any
boy
lacking
his
sense
of
athletic
precision
would
have
scored
a
dangerous
fall
andy
now
slowly
worked
his
way
down
thrown
the
branches
of
the
tree
he
got
a
few
sharp
scratches
but
was
vastly
pleased
with
himself
when
he
landed
safely
on
the
ground
to
fairview
he
spoke
with
a
stimulating
sense
of
freedom
waving
his
hand
across
the
scene
in
general
i
may
not
come
back
rich
or
famous
but
i
shall
have
seen
the
world
andy
did
not
turn
in
the
direction
of
centreville
he
felt
of
the
pocket
containing
his
father
watch
and
the
little
box
and
then
headed
straight
for
millville
that
was
where
the
big
scholar
graham
lived
it
was
five
miles
away
graham
boarded
with
the
farmer
who
had
bought
dale
cow
and
calf
andy
had
kept
graham
in
mind
ever
since
he
had
agreed
to
pay
for
burning
up
the
hay
stack
it
was
about
two
when
he
reached
his
destination
the
night
he
and
his
school
companions
had
restored
the
little
calf
to
its
frantic
mother
andy
had
seen
graham
in
the
window
of
his
room
in
the
old
farmhouse
andy
now
looked
up
at
the
window
of
this
room
it
was
open
a
trellis
ran
up
its
side
the
house
was
dark
and
silent
he
scaled
the
trellis
and
rested
a
hand
on
the
window
sill
graham
he
called
out
softly
then
he
repeated
the
call
several
times
gradually
raising
his
voice
there
was
a
rustle
of
bed
clothes
a
droning
mumble
andy
called
again
what
is
it
who
is
there
questioned
graham
tones
it
me
said
andy
do
be
disturbed
just
listen
for
a
minute
will
you
eh
is
that
andy
wildwood
exclaimed
graham
yes
answered
andy
a
figure
came
to
the
window
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
there
graham
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
wonderingly
at
the
strange
midnight
visitor
clinging
to
the
window
sill
why
what
the
trouble
andy
he
questioned
in
a
tone
of
surprise
it
trouble

responded
andy
with
a
little
nervous
catch
in
his
voice
i

much
of
it
around
here
that
i
concluded
to

graham
indignantly
that

burning
shame

around

in
the
attic

continued
andy
handing
over
the
contents
of
his
pocket
and
thank

andy
declared
graham
in
a
warm
friendly
way

from
home
but
i
try
to
stop
you

answered
andy
you
wait
a
minute
then
graham
took
the
watch
and
the
box
and
retired
from
the
window
as
he
returned
he
pressed
a
folded
piece
of
paper
between
andy
fingers
take
that
he
said
what
is
it
asked
andy
it
a
bill
oh
graham
no
nonsense
andy
i
know
from
practical
experience
what
it
is
to
start
out
in
the
world
penniless
i
have
the
money
saved
up
for
two
board
and
schooling
i
wo
miss
that
little
amount
until
way
along
next
fall
you
will
have
paid
it
back
long
before
that
i
warrant
you
bet
i
will
and
you
awful
good
to
me
declared
andy
heartily
just
one
more
word
andy
resumed
graham
earnestly
if
you
are
determined
to
be
a
circus
tumbler
be
the
best
or
nothing
if
you
like
enjoyment
made
it
good
clean
fun
i
not
afraid
of
you
i
only
giving
the
advice
of
a
fellow
older
than
you
who
has
learned
that
it
pays
to
be
right
and
do
right
in
the
long
run
when
andy
once
more
stood
in
the
road
with
his
royal
friend
good
luck
old
fellow
still
echoing
in
his
ears
his
heart
was
very
full
it
mighty
good
of
him
murmured
andy
safely
stowing
away
the
bill
i
deserve
his
good
opinion
see
if
i
do
andy
walked
on
a
mile
or
two
further
climbing
a
fence
he
made
a
snug
bed
alongside
a
convenient
haystack
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
when
the
lad
awoke
refreshed
and
full
of
spirit
and
hope
he
somehow
felt
as
though
he
was
beginning
the
most
eventful
day
of
his
life
andy
turned
his
face
in
the
direction
of
centreville
he
had
no
idea
of
going
direct
there
however
that
day
he
did
not
know
how
many
people
from
fairview
might
have
seen
him
there
the
day
previous
he
did
know
that
if
aunt
lavinia
was
determined
to
pursue
him
the
first
thing
she
would
think
of
was
his
circus
predilections
andy
planned
cautiously
and
with
wisdom
from
watching
the
circus
posters
he
knew
it
route
centreville
was
in
another
county
from
fairview
but
clifton
the
next
point
of
exhibition
was
in
another
state
that
suits
me
he
murmured
andy
had
an
idea
that
once
safely
over
the
state
line
the
law
could
not
reach
him
so
readily
as
on
home
territory
he
knew
the
neighboring
towns
pretty
fairly
and
he
fixed
on
clifton
as
his
destination
clifton
was
about
eight
miles
from
centreville
andy
decided
he
would
go
there
and
put
in
the
time
until
next
morning
at
midnight
the
show
would
pull
up
stakes
at
centreville
he
would
be
on
hand
to
welcome
its
arrival
at
clifton
then
i
will
see
miss
starr
and
marco
he
thought
if
the
circus
manager
will
only
take
me
on
i
fall
into
great
luck
andy
got
to
clifton
about
noon
he
changed
the
bill
buying
a
cheap
but
big
dinner
for
he
was
nearly
famished
he
learned
where
the
circus
was
to
exhibit
and
went
to
the
spot
some
workers
were
already
there
digging
trenches
distributing
sawdust
and
the
like
andy
volunteered
to
help
them
it
would
be
good
practice
in
the
way
of
experience
he
told
himself
until
four
in
the
afternoon
he
was
quite
busy
about
the
place
he
had
heard
so
much
circus
talk
during
his
free
labors
that
his
mind
was
more
full
of
the
show
than
ever
andy
had
heard
one
of
the
workers
describe
to
a
new
hand
all
the
excitement
bustle
and
novelty
attending
a
jump
from
one
town
to
another
he
strolled
about
the
place
but
grew
restive
just
before
dusk
he
bought
some
crackers
and
cheese
filled
his
pockets
with
the
eatables
and
started
down
the
road
leading
towards
centreville
andy
met
an
advance
guard
of
the
circus
about
two
miles
out
of
clifton
some
wagons
carried
the
cooking
camp
outfit
a
little
farther
on
he
was
met
by
some
menagerie
wagons
they
come
in
sections
ruminated
andy
the
big
tent
people
wo
make
a
start
till
after
the
evening
performance
i
wo
risk
going
any
farther
there
an
open
barn
near
the
road
i
take
a
little
snooze
and
wake
up
in
time
to
join
the
procession
of
big
loads
andy
secured
his
little
cash
reserve
in
a
marble
bag
he
ate
some
lunch
and
made
for
the
open
structure
he
had
observed
it
was
an
old
doorless
barn
near
a
hay
press
a
great
many
bales
were
stack
up
at
one
side
climbing
among
these
andy
found
a
cozy
boxed
in
space
carried
some
loose
hay
to
it
and
composed
himself
for
sleep
twenty
cents
a
day
is
pretty
economical
living
he
reflected
as
he
studied
the
stars
visible
through
a
chink
in
the
roof
i
wonder
what
the
circus
people
pay
a
beginner
wondering
about
this
and
a
variety
of
similar
themes
andy
dozed
but
was
suddenly
awakened
by
the
sharp
snap
of
a
match
and
a
brief
flare
he
got
up
and
peered
over
the
edge
of
the
bales
of
hay
that
enclosed
his
resting
place
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
outlined
at
the
open
doorway
of
the
barn
was
a
man
he
leaned
against
a
post
had
just
lit
a
cigar
and
was
looking
intently
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
centreville
some
wagons
rattled
by
and
the
man
drew
inside
the
barn
out
of
view
andy
made
out
that
he
was
and
very
active
and
nervous
in
his
manner
that
man
is
waiting
for
some
one
decided
andy
getting
interested
yes
and
he
belongs
to
the
show
i
bet
andy
reasoned
this
out
from
the
facility
with
which
the
man
hummed
out
a
tune
he
had
heard
the
circus
orchestra
play
the
man
paced
restively
to
and
fro
he
went
out
into
the
road
and
looked
far
down
it
he
returned
to
the
barn
and
resumed
his
impatient
pacing
to
and
fro
nearly
an
hour
went
by
in
this
fashion
andy
began
to
consider
that
he
had
become
curious
without
much
reason
he
was
about
to
drop
back
again
to
his
cozy
bed
when
he
heard
the
man
utter
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
braced
up
and
as
a
new
figure
turned
from
the
road
spoke
in
a
cautious
but
distinct
tone
that
you
murdock
it
me
sure
enough
daley
came
the
reply
s
sh
do
use
my
name
here
you
know
all
right
no
one
likely
to
hear
us
in
this
lonely
spot
though
spoke
the
newcomer
addressed
as
murdock
well
what
have
you
to
report
questioned
daley
eagerly
it
all
right
you
fixed
it
snug
and
sure
the
show
will
have
a
big
sensation
not
down
on
the
bills
the
listening
andy
heard
the
man
called
daley
utter
a
gratified
chuckle
good
he
said
and
there
be
a
vacancy
on
the
benares
brothers
team
added
daley
so
give
me
the
twenty
dollars
chapter
x
a
first
appearance
andy
pricked
up
his
ears
with
a
good
deal
of
animation
the
jubilant
statement
of
the
fellow
called
murdock
did
not
sound
honest
i
taking
your
word
for
it
spoke
daley
he
had
drawn
something
from
his
pocket
evidently
a
roll
of
bills
for
as
he
extended
it
murdock
said
eagerly
twenty
dollars
yes
tell
me
how
you
fixed
it
why
answered
murdock
with
a
cruel
laugh
you
was
laid
off
as
one
of
the
benares
brothers
up
at
the
show
on
account
of
drinking
was
you
daley
moodily
nodded
his
head
they
put
on
thacher
in
your
place
you
and
him
are
probably
the
only
two
men
in
the
profession
who
can
do
the
somersault
trapeze
act
with
old
benares
that
puts
you
out
of
a
job
for
you
no
good
single
i
guess
that
is
right
thacher
takes
the
bread
out
of
my
mouth
sink
him
you
say
dollars
if
i
fix
thacher
so
he
ca
act
well
declared
murdock
in
a
way
that
made
andy
shiver
he
act
for
a
spell
after
i
thinking
come
to
the
point
what
did
you
do
why
after
doing
their
regular
stunt
on
a
separate
trapeze
thatcher
somersaults
and
catches
a
bar
swing
from
centre
he
hangs
by
his
knees
and
benares
swings
from
aloft
and
catches
his
hands
in
his
dive
for
life
well
the
minute
thacher
lands
on
the
centre
trapeze
down
he
goes
forty
feet
it
broken
limbs
or
nothing
for
i
cut
the
bar
free
first
thing
after
the
afternoon
performance
it
held
in
place
now
by
only
two
little
pieces
of
thread
that
a
child
finger
could
break
um
remarked
daley
i
guess
i
cut
for
it
they
think
i
a
hundred
miles
away
it
must
be
known
that
i
was
this
near
the
circus
or
they
suspect
me
i
presume
they
be
wiring
for
me
to
come
back
now
oh
sure
they
wo
suspect
me
either
i
sneaked
in
the
big
tent
and
fixed
the
trapeze
when
no
one
was
about
see
here
daley
if
you
do
get
your
job
back
you
ought
to
give
me
an
extra
ten
i
see
about
it
said
daley
the
two
worthies
walked
from
the
place
andy
watched
them
cross
fields
away
from
the
main
road
and
away
from
both
clifton
and
centreville
little
thrills
of
horror
ran
all
over
the
boy
this
was
his
first
view
of
the
dark
plotful
side
of
circus
life
and
it
appalled
him
why
he
exclaimed
it
may
be
murder
oh
those
wretches
the
benares
brothers
i
saw
them
yesterday
i
remember
the
dive
for
life
i
had
to
hold
my
breath
when
one
man
made
that
somersault
away
up
at
the
top
of
the
tent
it
was
more
than
thrilling
when
he
caught
the
other
trapeze
with
his
knees
it
was
curdling
when
his
partner
made
his
dive
for
life
one
second
over
time
one
miss
of
an
inch
and
it
looked
sure
death
and
now
that
trapeze
has
been
tampered
with
and
the
excited
andy
did
not
finish
the
sentence
he
forgot
all
his
own
plans
and
the
possible
danger
of
arrest
at
centreville
he
jumped
down
from
the
hay
bales
and
dashed
out
of
the
barn
andy
sped
along
the
highway
at
the
top
of
his
speed
the
situation
had
appealed
to
him
in
a
flash
the
two
plotters
had
talked
in
plain
english
there
was
no
misunderstanding
their
motives
and
acts
andy
had
a
vivid
picture
in
his
mind
the
big
circus
tent
four
miles
away
he
could
recall
just
where
the
benares
brothers
act
came
on
the
programme
it
was
about
ninth
down
the
list
yesterday
afternoon
he
mused
softly
they
begin
the
show
about
eight
it
now
about
nine
i
calculate
the
benares
brothers
come
on
this
evening
at
about
a
quarter
to
ten
four
miles
i
can
run
that
in
half
an
hour
yes
i
shall
be
in
time
andy
pressed
his
arms
to
his
sides
took
breath
to
conserve
his
staying
powers
and
maintained
a
steady
telling
pace
the
lights
of
centreville
began
to
show
nearer
he
heard
a
town
bell
strike
the
as
he
came
in
sight
of
the
grounds
and
the
illuminated
big
tent
of
the
show
the
band
inside
was
blaring
away
the
side
shows
were
not
doing
much
business
some
were
getting
ready
for
the
removal
there
were
not
many
people
around
the
main
entrance
andy
quite
breathless
rushed
up
to
the
ticket
taker
there
i
want
to
go
in
for
just
a
minute
he
said
i
must
see
the
manager
cut
for
it
no
gags
go
here
retorted
the
man
rudely
it
pretty
important
here
began
andy
then
he
paused
in
dismay
oh
dear
he
spoke
to
himself
i
never
put
on
my
coat
that
i
used
as
a
pillow
back
in
that
barn
in
the
hurry
and
excitement
of
the
occasion
andy
had
left
the
coat
among
the
hay
bales
just
before
arranging
his
bed
he
had
stowed
the
marble
bag
containing
the
balance
of
graham
five
dollars
in
a
pocket
of
the
garment
he
could
not
therefore
pay
his
fare
into
the
show
only
for
an
instant
however
was
andy
daunted
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
could
get
more
promptly
to
the
manager
or
the
ringmaster
from
the
rear
he
ran
around
the
big
white
mountain
of
canvas
till
he
reached
the
performers
tent
patrolling
outside
of
it
was
a
watchman
please
let
me
in
said
andy
hurriedly
i
want
to
see
the
manager
quick
yes
they
all
do
games
do
go
here
no
no
i
not
trying
to
it
cried
andy
please
call
marco
or
miss
starr
they
know
me
i
tell
you
i
too
old
a
bird
to
get
caught
by
chaff
get
now
the
watchman
struck
andy
a
sharp
rap
over
the
shoulders
andy
was
in
desperation
he
was
started
to
run
around
to
some
other
of
the
minor
tents
when
a
shifting
slit
in
the
canvas
gave
him
a
momentary
view
of
the
interior
of
the
big
circus
tent
oh
cried
andy
wringing
his
hands
the
very
act
is
on
the
benares
brothers
i
must
act
at
once
andy
made
a
rush
intent
on
getting
under
the
canvas
at
all
hazards
he
checked
himself
if
he
succeeded
in
eluding
the
watchman
outside
he
would
have
difficulty
in
getting
to
the
manager
he
might
be
captured
inside
at
once
he
stood
staring
at
the
tent
top
in
extreme
anxiety
and
suspense
shadows
aloft
enlightened
him
as
was
going
on
the
benares
brothers
were
mounting
aloft
he
made
them
out
bowing
gracefully
pulled
up
on
the
toe
coils
he
saw
their
outlines
the
orchestra
struck
up
a
new
tune
the
act
was
about
to
commence
i
must
stop
them
i
will
warn
them
panted
andy
with
resolution
if
i
got
to
the
manager
he
might
not
understand
me
or
believe
me
it
might
be
too
late
there
is
not
a
minute
to
spare
andy
was
quivering
with
excitement
his
eyes
flashing
his
face
flushed
he
ran
towards
a
guy
rope
sprang
up
caught
at
it
and
hand
over
hand
rapidly
ascended
it
where
it
tapped
the
lower
dip
of
the
upper
canvas
he
transferred
his
grasp
a
seam
was
here
held
together
by
hook
and
ring
clear
to
the
gap
at
the
centre
pole
this
seam
andy
discerned
ran
right
over
to
the
trapezes
andy
scaled
the
course
of
the
seam
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
hooking
the
rings
with
his
fingers
and
pulling
himself
up
the
canvas
quivered
shook
and
gave
but
he
did
not
heed
that
he
came
to
the
open
gap
around
the
centre
pole
seized
the
bound
edge
of
the
canvas
and
gazed
down
ten
feet
across
was
old
benares
just
getting
ready
for
some
evolutions
directly
under
andy
was
the
trapeze
holding
the
man
he
supposed
to
be
thacher
over
his
head
swung
a
smaller
trapeze
andy
lay
flat
along
the
sloping
canvas
and
stuck
his
head
further
down
thacher
mr
thacher
he
shouted
eh
why
hello
who
are
you
in
wonderment
the
trapezist
gazed
up
at
the
earnest
agitated
face
gazing
down
at
him
at
that
juncture
there
was
an
ominous
rip
andy
weight
it
seemed
had
pressed
too
forcibly
down
upon
a
rotted
section
of
the
canvas
a
strip
about
a
foot
wide
tore
free
binding
and
all
from
the
edge
nearest
the
centre
pole
it
split
six
feet
sheer
andy
feet
went
over
his
head
but
he
kept
a
tight
grip
on
the
end
of
the
strip
dangling
in
mid
air
sixty
feet
above
the
ring
andy
swung
in
space
his
first
appearance
before
the
circus
public
chapter
xi
sawdust
and
spangles
andy
stared
down
at
a
sea
of
faces
they
seemed
far
away
the
circus
manager
had
stepped
briskly
out
into
the
ring
in
great
wonderment
he
stood
gazing
aloft
the
audience
swayed
and
a
general
murmur
filled
the
air
many
pointed
upwards
some
arose
from
their
seats
craning
their
necks
in
excitement
the
orchestra
dropped
the
music
to
low
undecided
notes
puzzled
spectators
wondered
if
the
strange
appearance
above
was
part
of
some
new
novelty
change
in
the
programme
andy
clung
to
the
dangling
strip
of
canvas
for
dear
life
the
trapezist
thacher
stared
at
him
in
profound
astonishment
he
was
about
to
speak
to
demand
an
explanation
when
there
was
a
second
ripping
sound
look
out
cried
thacher
sharply
andy
saw
what
was
happening
the
canvas
strip
that
had
torn
free
lengthwise
was
now
splitting
its
breadth
in
another
moment
a
mere
filament
of
cloth
would
hold
andy
suspended
he
must
act
and
act
quickly
or
take
a
plunge
sixty
feet
down
andy
did
not
lose
his
presence
of
mind
just
the
same
as
if
he
was
on
the
rafters
of
the
old
barn
at
home
or
practicing
on
a
rope
strung
from
two
high
tree
tops
as
had
been
many
a
time
the
case
he
calculated
his
chances
and
set
his
skill
at
work
he
ventured
a
brief
swing
on
the
frail
strip
of
canvas
as
it
finally
tore
free
in
his
hand
andy
dropped
it
he
had
got
his
momentum
however
it
was
to
swing
sideways
and
down
the
next
instant
andy
was
at
the
side
of
thacher
one
hand
caught
and
held
to
a
rope
of
the
trapeze
there
andy
anchored
resting
one
knee
on
the
edge
of
the
performing
bar
you
a
good
one
muttered
the
trapezist
in
wonder
do
get
rattled
now
not
while
i
got
my
grip
say
projected
andy
i
sorry
to
interrupt
the
performance
but
it
a
matter
of
life
or
death
eh
uttered
thacher
in
a
puzzled
way
what
up
do
you
know
a
man
named
murdock
ring
man
fired
last
week
yes
what
of
it
do
you
know
a
man
named
daley
fired
too
for
drinking
i
took
his
place
on
this
team
they
hate
you
they
have
plotted
to
disable
you
the
trapeze
yonder
murdock
has
cut
the
ropes
secured
the
bar
with
thread
and
the
slightest
touch
will
send
a
performer
to
the
ring
with
broken
limbs
what
are
you
crazy
or
fooling
doped
the
rigging
why
that
murder
kid
they
have
done
it
just
the
same
listen
faster
than
he
had
ever
talked
before
andy
told
of
the
conversation
he
had
overheard
in
the
old
hay
barn
he
hurriedly
recited
his
failure
in
reaching
the
manager
he
told
of
his
rapid
ascent
of
the
top
canvas
the
present
denouement
had
resulted
under
his
face
rouge
thacher
showed
the
shock
of
vivid
emotions
the
murmur
below
was
increasing
the
manager
was
looking
up
impatiently
old
benares
across
on
his
trapeze
regarded
his
partner
in
bewilderment
suddenly
thacher
shot
out
some
words
towards
him
it
was
a
kind
of
circus
gibberish
mixed
with
enough
straight
english
to
enlighten
andy
that
his
story
was
being
imparted
to
old
benares
you
must
get
me
out
of
this
said
andy
the
audience
is
becoming
restive
thacher
extended
his
hand
the
back
showing
in
the
direction
of
the
orchestra
the
band
at
this
signal
struck
up
a
quick
lively
tune
get
clear
on
the
bar
directed
thacher
rapidly
giving
andy
more
room
say
he
added
in
some
surprise
at
andy
cleverness
you
seem
at
home
all
right
performer
oh
no
only
a
little
amateur
practice
it
given
you
the
right
nerve
now
then
you
ca
get
up
again
you
got
to
go
down
want
to
do
it
gracefully
sure
smiled
andy
perfectly
calm
and
collected
the
situation
rather
delighted
him
than
otherwise
he
had
supreme
confidence
in
his
companion
and
felt
that
he
was
in
safe
hands
are
you
grit
for
a
swing
pursued
thacher
try
me
said
andy
thacher
called
over
some
further
words
to
old
benares
the
latter
at
once
swung
down
from
his
trapeze
holding
on
by
his
knees
both
hands
extended
towards
his
partner
do
just
as
i
say
directed
thacher
to
andy
let
me
get
you
under
the
arms
double
your
knees
up
to
your
chin
can
you
hold
yourself
that
way
yes
assented
andy
now
spoke
thacher
sharply
the
next
instant
the
performer
had
dropped
andy
in
his
clasp
he
had
slipped
an
ankle
halter
to
one
of
his
own
limbs
this
alone
held
him
head
downward
he
lightly
swung
andy
to
and
fro
andy
rolled
up
like
a
ball
ready
for
the
next
move
all
this
had
consumed
less
than
two
minutes
now
the
audience
believed
andy
sensational
appearance
a
regularly
arranged
feature
of
the
performance
the
oddity
of
a
boy
in
ordinary
dress
coming
into
the
act
as
andy
had
done
excited
the
profoundest
interest
and
attention
the
manager
in
the
ring
below
stood
like
one
petrified
puzzled
beyond
all
comprehension
the
orchestra
checked
its
music
an
intense
strain
pervaded
the
audience
swayed
but
that
only
there
was
a
profound
silence
one
two
three
said
thacher
at
intervals
come
answered
old
benares
at
the
end
of
a
long
swift
swing
of
his
body
thacher
let
go
of
andy
who
spun
across
a
ten
feet
space
that
looked
twenty
to
the
audience
below
andy
felt
a
light
contact
old
benares
double
grip
caught
under
his
arms
the
act
was
the
merest
novice
trick
analyzed
by
an
expert
but
it
set
the
audience
wild
a
prodigious
cheer
arose
clapping
of
hands
juvenile
yells
of
admiration
the
band
came
in
with
a
ringing
march
old
benares
righted
himself
andy
with
him
he
said
can
you
hold
on
alone
one
little
minute
sure
said
andy
the
trapezist
reached
up
and
untied
the
descending
rope
secured
it
to
the
bar
and
shouted
to
those
standing
below
two
ring
hands
ran
out
into
the
sawdust
caught
the
other
end
and
held
it
perfectly
taut
can
you
slide
down
it
asked
benares
andy
eyes
sparkled
say
benares
he
replied
if
i
was
rattled
by
all
that
crowd
i
could
do
it
head
first
i
done
the
regular
one
leg

fifty
times
you

admirable
an
declaimed
old
benares
who

andy
wildwood
do

a
real
circus
act

i
think

them
yell
you
have
made
a
hit
good
boy
be
careful
go
andy
essayed
an
old
rope
performance
he
had
seen
done
once
and
had
many
times
practiced
this
was
to
secure
one
leg
around
the
rope
throw
himself
outwards
fold
his
arms
and
wind
round
and
round
the
rope
slowly
descending
the
orchestra
caught
the
cue
and
kept
time
with
appropriate
music
a
second
hush
held
the
audience
without
a
break
andy
descended
the
forty
odd
feet
of
cable
nearing
its
end
he
caught
at
the
rope
to
steady
himself
then
he
gracefully
leaped
free
of
it
to
the
sawdust
and
made
a
profound
bow
to
the
audience
amid
wild
thunders
of
applause
chapter
xii
an
arm
of
the
law
the
circus
manager
followed
andy
as
the
latter
darted
past
the
band
stand
and
into
the
passageway
leading
to
the
performers
tent
his
face
was
a
blank
of
wonderment
the
ringmaster
joined
him
and
so
did
one
or
two
others
as
he
hurried
after
andy
they
found
the
latter
holding
to
a
guy
rope
andy
head
was
spinning
the
reaction
from
intense
excitement
made
him
weak
and
breathless
for
some
moments
the
audience
was
still
in
a
pleasant
flutter
of
commotion
over
the
unique
act
that
had
caught
their
fancy
the
benares
brothers
went
on
with
their
performance
they
cut
out
the
dive
for
life
but
they
made
up
for
it
by
some
dazzling
aerial
evolutions
that
thrilled
the
spectators
and
everybody
seemed
satisfied
five
minutes
later
they
joined
the
group
crowding
around
andy
the
manager
had
just
finished
questioning
the
lad
as
to
details
of
the
remarkable
story
he
had
told
his
face
was
stern
and
angry
as
he
uttered
some
quick
words
to
the
ringmaster
then
the
latter
taking
a
weighted
toe
rope
in
his
hand
went
out
into
the
ring
from
where
he
was
andy
could
see
this
flung
aloft
it
caught
across
the
bar
of
the
doped
trapeze
at
a
touch
this
latter
came
hurtling
to
the
ground
old
benares
watching
also
trembled
with
intense
anger
it
is
infamoos
he
declared
where
should
my
partner
be
but
for
this
boy
the
ringmaster
examined
the
loosened
trapeze
bar
just
as
andy
had
stated
two
slight
threads
alone
had
held
it
to
the
supporting
ropes
thacher
laid
a
friendly
grateful
hand
on
andy
shoulder
he
was
too
full
of
emotion
to
speak
andy
looked
up
and
smiled
brightly
good
thing
i
was
around
was
it
he
said
carelessly
oh
mr
marco
the
man
with
the
iron
jaw
came
up
to
the
group
at
this
juncture
you
andy
wildwood
he
said
i
heard
of
the
trapeze
so
it
is
you
again
come
with
me
no
do
keep
him
continued
marco
to
thacher
in
a
hurried
way
that
made
andy
curious
you
can
see
him
again
come
lad
what
the
trouble
mr
marco
asked
andy
marco
did
not
answer
he
kept
hold
of
andy
arm
and
led
him
to
the
rear
about
to
enter
the
performers
tent
he
dodged
back
keep
close
to
me
he
directed
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
excitement
quick
wildwood
out
this
way
hurry
now
he
had
darted
towards
the
bottom
of
the
canvas
strip
siding
the
passageway
lifting
this
up
he
thrust
andy
under
it
crawling
after
him
and
arising
to
his
feet
he
again
grasped
andy
arm
headed
for
the
open
space
the
main
entrance
faced
marco
suddenly
jerked
andy
to
one
side
he
now
made
swiftly
for
some
small
tents
abutting
the
performers
tent
hey
hi
hello
some
one
had
yelled
out
at
them
and
andy
saw
two
skulking
forms
making
towards
them
a
third
figure
joined
them
andy
discerned
evident
pursuit
in
their
manner
and
actions
keep
with
me
run
in
directed
marco
he
had
thrust
andy
into
one
of
the
little
tents
the
boy
recognized
as
a
dressing
room
marco
dropped
the
flap
and
stood
outside
where
the
boy
gone
to
puffed
out
a
labored
voice
gracious
exclaimed
andy
under
cover
but
with
a
gasp
of
sheer
dismay
i
understand
now
andy
recognized
the
tones
of
this
last
speaker
they
belonged
to
wagner
the
village
constable
of
fairview
he
in
that
little
tent
spoke
another
voice
surround
it
ordered
wagner
here
you
stand
aside
the
boy
i
been
looking
for
all
day
is
in
that
tent
i
want
him
hold
on
retorted
marco
this
is
private
circus
property
yes
and
i
a
public
officer
i
have
you
know
said
wagner
no
use
do
interfere
with
the
course
of
justice
or
you
get
into
trouble
there
was
no
light
in
the
tent
the
many
flaring
gasoline
torches
outside
however
cast
a
radiance
that
enabled
andy
to
pretty
accurately
make
out
the
situation
he
traced
two
shadowy
figures
making
a
circuit
of
the
tent
he
could
see
marco
push
back
wagner
the
latter
was
unsteady
of
gait
and
voice
andy
theorized
that
he
had
been
commissioned
by
his
aunt
to
pursue
him
wagner
had
come
down
to
centreville
with
two
assistants
their
expenses
were
probably
paid
in
advance
and
they
had
made
a
kind
of
individual
celebration
of
the
trip
i
been
looking
for
that
boy
all
day
now
spoke
wagner
i
know
you
have
answered
marco
standing
like
a
statue
at
the
door
of
the
tent
he
a
fugitive
from
justice
i
bound
to
have
him
i
an
arm
of
the
law
what
he
done
inquired
marco
he
nearly
broken
his
poor
old
aunt
heart
i
did
ask
about
his
aunt
heart
what
he
done
oh
why
hum
that
so
well
he
been
expelled
from
school
because
of
his
crazy
circus
capers
indeed
i
a
circus
man
do
you
observe
anything
particularly
crazy
about
me
demanded
marco
say
my
friend
you
get
out
of
this
marco
the
man
with
the
iron
jaw
it
wo
be
healthy
for
me
to
tackle
you
and
i
will
if
you
make
yourself
obstreperous
you
wo
get
that
boy
until
you
show
me
convincingly
that
you
have
a
legal
right
to
do
so
legal
right
why
cried
wagner
drawing
out
a
paper
there
my
warrant
let
me
look
at
it
please
oh
said
marco
examining
the
document
issued
in
another
county
we
pretty
good
lawyers
us
show
folks
and
i
can
tell
you
that
you
will
have
to
get
a
search
warrant
issued
in
this
county
before
you
dare
set
a
foot
in
that
tent
the
fairview
constable
was
nonplussed
marco
was
right
and
wagner
knew
it
he
threshed
about
fumed
and
threatened
and
finally
said
all
right
i
guess
you
know
the
law
we
may
have
no
right
to
enter
that
tent
without
a
local
search
warrant
but
the
minute
we
get
the
boy
outside
we
can
take
him
on
sight
you
wo
have
the
chance
observed
marco
we
see
hey

his
two
assistants

a
close

minute

nodded
marco
calmly
watch
out
boys
i
wo
be
gone
at
that
moment
a
waddling
man
came
up
smoking
an
immense
pipe

he
said
to
marco

vant

a
minute
snitzellbaum
directed
marco
marco
held
the
newcomer
at
bay
until
wagner
had
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
town
then
leaning
over
he
whispered
in
the
ear
of
the
rotund
musician
ha

marco
with
a
quick

marco

spoke
marco
in
a
loud
tone
well
go
in
and
get
it
andy
knew
something
was
afoot
from
what
he
observed
he
hoped
it
was
in
the
line
of
preventing
his
return
to
fairview
in
about
five
minutes
the
fat
german
came
out
of
the
tent
lugging
his
big
bass
drum
with
him
i
put
him
on
dot
vagon

puffed

declared
marco
another
went
by
at
its
end
wagner
came
hurrying
up
to
the
spot
he
had
a
companion
with
him
a
fellow
evidently
a
local
officer

announced
wagner
with
a
chuckle
lifting
the
flap
of
the
tent
say
how
this
andy
wildwood
is
gone
chapter
xiii
on
the
road
come
oud
said
hans
snitzellbaum
i
glad
to
answered
andy
wildwood
he
took
a
long
refreshing
draught
of
pure
air
and
stood
up
and
stretched
his
cramped
limbs
with
satisfaction
when
the
man
with
the
iron
jaw
had
whispered
to
the
fat
musician
outside
the
dressing
tent
guarded
by
wagner
assistants
he
had
asked
him
to
get
andy
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
constable
the
fat
sides
of
hans
snitzellbaum
shook
with
jollity
and
his
merry
eye
twinkled
at
the
hint
conveyed
by
andy
staunch
friend
when
hans
came
inside
the
tent
a
whispered
word
to
andy
was
sufficient
to
make
the
young
fugitive
understand
what
was
coming
hans
removed
the
top
head
of
his
big
bass
drum
andy
snuggled
along
the
rounded
woodwork
of
the
instrument
and
the
drum
head
was
replaced
the
double
load
was
a
pretty
heavy
one
for
the
portly
musician
to
handle
but
all
went
well
he
got
away
from
the
dressing
tent
without
arousing
the
suspicions
of
the
constable
assistants
the
drum
was
hoisted
to
the
top
of
a
moving
wagon
at
some
distance
andy
was
rather
crowded
and
short
of
breath
but
he
lay
quiet
and
serene
as
the
wagon
started
up
they
must
have
traveled
four
miles
before
the
musician
welcome
invitation
to
come
oud
followed
a
second
removal
of
the
drum
head
andy
looked
about
him
they
were
slowly
traversing
the
main
road
leading
from
centreville
to
clifton
there
was
bright
moonlight
and
the
general
view
was
interesting
and
picturesque
ahead
and
behind
a
seemingly
interminable
caravan
was
in
motion
chariots
cages
vehicles
holding
tent
paraphernalia
a
calliope
ticket
wagons
horses
mules
ponies
seemed
in
endless
parade
performers
and
general
circus
employees
thronged
the
various
vehicles
that
in
which
andy
now
found
himself
was
a
wagon
with
high
slatted
sides
piled
full
of
trunks
mattresses
seat
cushions
and
curtains
the
fat
musician
reclined
in
a
dip
in
the
soft
bedding
his
bulky
body
had
formed
over
beyond
him
lay
a
man
in
an
exhausted
slumber
looking
so
utterly
done
out
and
ill
that
andy
pitied
him
a
boy
about
andy
own
age
and
two
men
whose
attire
and
general
appearance
suggested
side
show
spielers
or
those
flashily
dressed
fellows
who
announce
the
wonders
on
view
inside
the
minor
canvases
lay
among
some
gaudy
draperies
the
two
men
lay
with
their
high
silk
hats
held
softly
by
both
hands
across
their
breasts
the
circus
tinge
was
everywhere
one
of
them
in
his
sleep
was
saying
ziripa
the
serpent
queen
step
up
gentlemen
eats
snakes
like
you
eat
strawberry
shortcake
eats
alive
bites
their
heads
off
as
the
wagon
jolted
on
hans
comfortably
smoked
a
pipe
fully
four
feet
long
his
twinkling
little
eyes
fairly
laughed
at
andy
as
the
latter
stepped
out
of
the
drum
hey

find
him
varm
hey
he
asked
i

smothered

declared
the
fat
musician

he
pointed
back
a
few
yards
andy
recognized
the
semaphore
set
where
a
narrow
road
intersected
the
highway
they
were
traversing
oh

andy
quickly
that

the
one
who
rides
the
donkey
and

funny
stories
oh
yaw
declared
the
musician
in
a
way
andy
was
naturally
surprised
he
could
hardly
realize
that
the
person
he
was
looking
at
could
ever
make
up
as
the
genius
who
was
the
life
and
fun
of
the
big
circus
ring
poor
billy
said
hans
shaking

poor

andy
suddenly
remembered
something
he
craned
his
neck
and
looked
steadfastly
along
the
road
i
want

little

explained
andy
i

something
there
earlier
in
the
evening
i
wo
be
a
minute
getting
it
in
about
as
they
approached
the
hay
barn
where
andy
had
overheard
the
conversation
between
daley
and
murdock
he
slipped
down
from
the
wagon
he
ran
ahead
went
up
among
the
hay
bales
found
the
coat
containing
the
marble
bag
holding
his
little
stock
of
money
and
speedily
rejoined
the
musician
hans
finished
his
pipe
and
sank
into
a
doze
andy
could
not
sleep
he
had
gone
through
too
much
excitement
that
day
to
readily
compose
himself
he
lay
listening
dreamily
to
the
jolty
clatter
of
the
wagons
the
shouts
of
the
drivers
and
the
commotion
of
the
animals
in
the
menagerie
cages
meanwhile
he
was
thinking
ardently
of
the
next
day
it
would
decide
his
fate
he
felt
hopeful
that
the
show
would
take
him
on
from
the
fact
that

had
required
his
presence

the

just
as
the
wagon
reached
the
tent
site
at
clifton
it
was
nearly
midnight
his
sleep
did
not
seem
to
have
refreshed
him
much
he
got
down
from
the
vehicle
like
a
man
and
as
if
the
effort
hurt
him
he
had
to
shake
himself
to
get
the
stiffness
out
of
his
limbs
dis

responded
andy
with
a
cheery
laugh
he
followed
billy
blow
the
latter
finally
found
the
wagon
he
was
after
he
bundled
its
contents
about
and
got
a
small
wooden
box
and
a
big
wicker
trunk
to
one
side
wish

said
to
andy
yes

glad

answered
andy
willingly
and
the
clown
hurried
off
in
his
usual
nervous
fashion
andy
was
kept
keenly
awake
for
the
ensuing
hour
it
did
not
seem
to
be
night
at
all
the
scene
about
him
was
one
of
constant
activity
andy
caught
a
glimpse
of
real
circus
life
its
details
filled
him
with
wonderment
admiration
and
keen
interest
the
scene
was
one
of
constantly
increasing
hustle
and
bustle
there
was
infinite
variety
and
excitement
in
the
occasion
for
all
that
there
was
a
system
precision
and
progress
in
all
that
was
done
that
fascinated
andy
the
boy
was
witnessing
the
building
of
a
great
city
in
itself
within
the
space
of
hours
the
caravan
wound
in
section
by
section
the
wagons
moved
to
set
places
as
if
doing
so
automatically
discharged
their
cumbersome
loads
and
retired
first
came
the
baggage
train
then
the
stake
and
chain
wagons
the
side
shows
paraphernalia
and
the
menagerie
cages
the
circus
area
proper
had
been
all
marked
out
the
ring
graded
and
straw
scattered
to
absorb
dampness
the
blacksmiths
wagons
cooks
caravan
and
the
minor
tents
all
removed
to
the
far
rear
the
naphtha
torches
were
set
every
twenty
feet
apart
to
illuminate
proceedings
workers
were
hauling
on
the
ground
great
hogsheads
of
water
near
the
dining
tents
table
cloths
were
already
hanging
out
on
wire
clothes
lines
to
dry
some
men
were
washing
small
tents
with
paraffin
to
season
them
against
the
weather
finally
the
great
team
lumbered
up
with
its
mighty
load
the
boss
canvasman
with
assistants
began
the
construction
of
the
main
top
or
performing
tent
holding
fifteen
thousand
people
andy
absorbed
in
every
maneuver
displayed
was
completely
lost
in
the
deepest
interest
when
a
voice
at
his
side
aroused
him
tired
waiting
asked
billy
blow
oh
no
answered
andy
i
could
watch
this
forever
i
think
it
would
soon
get
stale
declared
the
clown
with
a
faint
smile
give
us
a
hand
partner
one
at
a
time
and
we
get
my
togs
and
ourselves
under
cover
andy
took
one
handle
of
the
box
the
clown
the
other
they
carried
it
to
the
door
of
one
of
twenty
small
tents
near
the
cook
quarters
they
brought
the
wicker
trunk
also
and
then
carried
box
and
trunk
inside
the
tent
andy
looked
about
it
curiously
a
candle
burned
on
a
bench
beyond
it
was
a
mattress
near
one
side
and
boxed
in
by
platform
sections
as
if
to
keep
off
draughts
was
a
second
smaller
mattress
on
a
stool
near
it
sat
a
woman
she
was
smiling
down
at
a
little
boy
lying
huddled
up
in
shawls
and
a
comforter
this
is
my
boy
wildwood
spoke
billy
blow
new
hand
midge
if
he
makes
good
the
little
fellow
nodded
in
a
grave
mature
way
at
andy
according
to
his
size
he
resembled
a
child
of
four
that
was
why
they
called
him
midget
andy
learned
later
that
he
was
ten
years
old
he
had
an
act
with
the
circus
going
around
the
ring
perched
on
the
shoulders
of
a
rider
he
also
sometimes
had
a
part
with
the
tom
thumb
acrobats
doing
some
clever
with
a
trick
shetland
pony
he
seemed
to
be
just
recovering
from
a
fit
of
sickness
his
face
prematurely
old
was
pinched
and
colorless
our
columbine
in
the
humpty
dumpty
afterpiece
was
the
way
the
clown
introduced
the
lady
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
all
your
trouble
miss
nellis
do
mention
it
billy
responded
the
woman
any
of
us
would
fight
for
it
to
help
you
or
the
kid
would
we
midge
i
do
know
why
answered
the
lad
in
a
weary
way
i
ai
much
good
any
more
now
hear
that
ungrateful
boy
rallied
miss
nellis
billy
the
doctor
says
his
whole
trouble
was
poisoned
canned
stuff
bad
water
and
a
cold
he
broken
the
fever
here
some
medicine
every
hour
a
spoonful
until
gone
and
doctor
says
he
be
fit
as
ever
in
a
day
or
two
that
good
said
the
clown
a
lone
tear
trickling
down
his
cheek
i
wish
i
could
afford
the
hotel
for
the
lad
instead
of
this
shack
life
but
my
wife
hospital
bills
drain
me
pretty
well
never
mind
better
times
coming
billy
do
you
get
disheartened
cheered
the
little
woman
remember
now
do
miss
that
medicine
miss
nellis
went
away
andy
heard
poor
billy
sigh
as
he
adjusted
the
larger
mattress
there
your
bunk
he
said
to
andy
marco
will
see
you
early
in
the
morning
andy
took
off
his
coat
and
shoes
and
lay
down
on
the
rude
bed
he
watched
midget
tracing
the
outlines
of
a
picture
with
his
white
finger
in
a
book
miss
nellis
had
brought
him
andy
saw
the
clown
go
over
to
a
stool
and
place
a
homely
watch
and
a
spoon
and
medicine
bottle
miss
nellis
had
given
him
upon
it
then
blow
came
back
to
the
big
mattress
and
sat
down
on
it
he
bent
his
face
in
his
hands
in
a
tired
way
every
minute
he
would
sway
with
sleepiness
start
up
and
try
to
keep
awake
the
man
is
for
the
want
of
sleep
worn
out
with
all
his
worries
thought
andy
blow
he
said
aloud
sitting
up
i
sleep
a
wink
this
is
all
so
new
to
me
i
just
disturb
you
rustling
about
here
please
let
me
attend
to
the
little
fellow
wo
you
and
you
take
a
good
sound
snooze
come
it
will
do
you
lots
of
good
no
no
began
the
clown
weakly
please
persisted
andy
honest
i
ca
close
my
eyes
now
do
you
have
a
care
i
give
midget
his
medicine
to
the
second
andy
felt
a
glow
of
real
pleasure
and
satisfaction
as
the
clown
lay
down
he
was
asleep
in
two
minutes
andy
went
over
to
the
stool
i
going
to
be
your
nurse
he
told
midget
suppose
you
sleep
too
i
ca
answered
the
little
fellow
i
been
asleep
all
day
wish
i
had
another
book
i
looked
this
one
through
a
hundred
times
i
could
tell
you
some
stories
andy
suggested
good
ones
will
you
say
will
you
pleaded
the
clown
boy
eagerly
you
bet
and
famous
ones
andy
kept
his
promise
he
ransacked
his
mind
for
the
brightest
stories
he
had
ever
read
never
was
there
a
more
interested
listener
andy
talked
in
a
low
voice
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
clown
midget
seemed
most
to
like
the
real
stories
of
his
own
village
life
that
andy
finally
drifted
into
that
what
i
like
he
said
after
andy
had
told
of
some
boyish
adventures
back
at
fairview
oh
i
so
tired
of
moving
on
all
the
time
moving
on
strange
thought
andy
and
that
just
the
kind
of
a
life
i
trying
to
get
into
midget
became
so
animated
that
andy
finally
got
him
to
tell
some
stories
about
circus
life
all
that
however
was
shop
talk
to
the
little
performer
but
andy
learned
considerable
from
the
little
fellow
who
appeared
to
know
as
much
about
the
ins
and
outs
of
show
life
as
some
veteran
of
the
ring
he
enlightened
his
auditor
greatly
in
the
line
of
real
circus
slang
andy
learned
that
in
show
vernacular
clowns
were
joys
and
other
performers
kinkers
a
pocket
book
was
a
leather
a
hat
a
lid
a
ticket
a
fake
an
elephant
a
bull
lemonade
was
juice
eyes
were
lamps
candy
peddlers
were
butchers
and
the
various
tents
tops
as
for
instance
main
top
cook
top
and
the
side
shows
were
kid
tops
finally
little
midge
went
to
sleep
andy
woke
him
up
each
hour
till
daybreak
to
take
his
medicine
after
the
last
dose
andy
went
outside
to
stretch
his
limbs
and
get
a
mouthful
of
fresh
air
he
saw
men
still
tirelessly
working
here
and
there
some
were
housing
the
live
stock
some
unpacking
seat
stands
some
fixing
the
banners
on
the
main
tent
andy
did
not
go
far
from
the
clown
tent
it
was
fairly
dawn
happening
to
glance
towards
the
chandelier
wagon
he
came
to
a
dead
and
stared
hello
said
andy
with
animation
there
that
jim
tapp
and
the
man
with
him
yes
it
the
fellow
murdock
i
saw
with
daley
in
the
old
hay
barn
as
he
stood
gazing
tapp
caught
sight
of
him
he
started
violently
and
spoke
some
quick
words
to
his
companion
pointing
towards
andy
that
the
man
who
cut
the
trapeze
murmured
andy
i
rouse
the
clown
and
tell
him
he
a
dangerous
man
to
have
lurking
around
hey
hey
called
out
tapp
at
just
that
moment
both
he
and
his
companion
started
running
towards
andy
there
was
that
in
their
bearing
that
warned
andy
they
meant
him
no
good
andy
did
not
pause
stop
i
tell
you
shouted
the
man
murdock
andy
made
a
for
the
clown
tent
as
he
neared
it
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
tapp
was
still
putting
after
him
his
companion
had
stooped
to
pick
up
an
iron
tent
stake
from
the
ground
this
he
let
drive
with
full
force
it
took
andy
squarely
between
the
shoulders
and
he
dropped
like
a
shot
chapter
xv
andy
joins
the
show
the
breath
seemed
clear
knocked
out
of
andy
body
the
shock
of
the
blow
from
the
stake
deprived
him
of
consciousness
andy
opened
his
eyes
in
about
two
minutes
he
found
himself
lying
on
the
ground
circus
employees
gathered
around
him
help
me
up
said
andy
in
a
confused
way
i
must
miss
giving
midge
his
medicine
eh
the
clown
boy
spoke
one
of
the
men
sharply
oh
said
andy
regaining
his
senses
more
completely
have
i
been
here
long
about
two
minutes
then
midge
is
all
right
oh
dear
andy
trying
to
arise
gasped
and
tottered
weakly
the
man
who
had
addressed
him
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
boss
of
the
others
he
held
andy
firmly
as
he
said
belong
with
billy
blow
all
right
we
take
you
to
his
tent
but
say
what
did
those
fellows
knock
you
out
for
did
you
see
the
fellows
inquired
andy
i
was
way
over
near
the
big
bunk
top
i
heard
some
one
holler
saw
you
running
two
fellows
were
after
you
one
let
drive
that
stake
it
took
you
between
the
shoulders
like
a
cannon
ball
an
ugly
throw
and
a
wicked
one
wonder
it
did
fetch
you
for
good
one
of
the
fellows
was
a
boy
named
jim
tapp
said
andy
that
rascal
eh
spoke
the
man
thought
he
quit
us
was
going
to
borrowed
all
he
could
and
salary
tied
up
on
an
attachment
the
other
was
a
man
named
murdock
he
the
fellow
who
cut
the
trapeze
on
benares
brothers
last
night
what
cried
the
man
with
a
jump
hey
men
you
hear
that
go
for
both
get
them
they
wanted
for
these
crooked
jobs
those
addressed
started
on
a
chase
pursuant
to
directions
of
their
leader
who
had
seen
murdock
and
tapp
run
away
as
he
came
up
to
the
prostrate
andy
the
man
himself
helped
andy
to
the
clown
tent
their
entrance
aroused
billy
blow
who
sprang
up
quickly
as
he
noticed
that
andy
walked
in
a
pained
disabled
fashion
he
was
quite
another
man
for
his
long
refreshing
sleep
why
what
the
matter
he
asked
andy
companion
explained
the
clown
expressed
his
sympathy
and
indignation
in
the
same
breath
he
urged
that
the
show
detectives
be
aroused
at
once
i
heard
harding
say
last
night
he
spend
a
thousand
dollars
but
get
daley
and
murdock
behind
the
bars
for
attempted
murder
declared
the
clown
the
man
who
had
assisted
andy
went
away
saying
he
would
consult
with
giles
harding
the
owner
of
the
circus
at
once
you
see
murdock
ventured
here
to
find
out
how
his
wicked
plot
succeeded
never
suspecting
that
he
was
found
out
theorized
the
clown
that
fellow
tapp
was
always
his
crony
they
a
bad
lot
you
can
guess
that
from
the
stake
they
threw
at
you
no
bones
broken
good
hurts
i
soon
fix
that
strip
now
all
right
the
clown
had
felt
all
over
andy
back
as
the
latter
sat
down
on
the
bench
now
he
made
andy
take
off
his
coat
and
shirt
then
he
produced
a
big
bottle
from
his
wicker
trunk
ever
hear
of
the
nine

of
the

into
the
palm
of
his
hand

andy

explained
the
clown
beginning
to

vigorously

the
clown
rubbed
andy
good
and
hard
then
he
made
him
lie
down
on
the
big
mattress
the
nine
oils
had
a
magical
effect
andy
pain
and
soreness
were
soon
soothed
he
fell
into
a
doze
and
woke
up
to
observe
that

the
only
reminder
he
had
of
murdock

assault
billy
blow
had
been
telling
marco
about
andy

mishap
marco
was
greatly
worked
up
over
it
he
said
the
attempted
trick
on

partner
had
become
noised
about
and
if
the
two

ten
wildwood
said
marco
miss

rose
tremendously

on
the
mend
and
was
as
lively
as

the
little
fellow
ate
a
hearty
meal
and
then
expressed
a
wish
for
an
airing
marco

one
of
the
wagons
used
by
some
performing
goats
and
andy
rode

the
grounds

about
eight
andy
went
to
the
principal
street
of
the
town
he
bought
himself
a
new
shirt
and
a
cap
going
back
to
the
clown
tent
he
washed
up
and
made
himself
generally
tidy
and
presentable
for
the
coming
interview
at
the
empire
hotel
andy
had
a
full
hour
to
spare
before
the
time
set
for
that
event

he
took
a
stroll
about
the
circus
grounds
meeting
jolly
old
hans
snitzellbaum
and
benares
and
his
partner
thacher
his
part
taken
in
the
impromptu
arenic
performance
of
the
evening
previous
had
become
generally
known
andy
was
pointed
out
to
the
watchmen
and
others
and
no
one
hindered
him
going
about
as
he
chose
andy
viewed
another
phase
of
show
detail
now
it
was
the
picturesque
part
the
family
side
of
circus
daily
life
he
saw
women
busy
at
fancy
work
or
sewing
their
children
playing
with
the
ring
ponies
or
petting
the
horse
some
of
the
men
were
mending
their
clothes
others
were
washing
out
collars
and
handkerchiefs
what
element
of
home
life
there
was
in
the
circus
experience

witnessed
in
his
brief
stroll

was
on
time

the

showed
him
up
to
the

was
listening
to
some
members
of
the
circus
minstrel
show
trying
over
some
new
airs
on
the
piano
the
moment
she
saw
him
she
came
forward
with
hand
extended
and
a
welcome
smile
on
her
kindly
face
she
made
andy
feel
at
home
at
once
she
insisted
on
hearing
all
the
details
of
his
experience
since
the
evening
he
had
saved
her
from
disaster
during
the
wind
storm

words
on

in

andy
made
his
best
bow
to
miss

fluttered

that

of
dollars
thank

sir
i
shall
not
forget
what
you
have

said
andy
for
all
that
andy
mind
was
for
the
present
full
only
of
the
pomp
and
glitter
of
his
new
calling
one
supreme
thought
made
his
heart
bubble
over
with
joy
at
last
he
had
reached
the
goal
of
his
fondest
wishes
andy
wildwood
had
joined
the
circus
chapter
xvi
the
registered
mail
andy
hurried
back
to
the
circus
grounds
the
happiest
boy
on
earth
he
went
straight
to
the
clown
tent
billy
blow
was
making
up
for
the
morning
parade
dressed
up
as
a
farmer
he
was
to
drive
a
hay
wagon
breaking
into
the
procession
here
and
there
along
the
line
of
march
finally
when
he
had
created
a
sensation
he
was
to
drop
his
disguise
and
emerge
in
his
usual
popular
ring
character
while
billy
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
his
toilet
he
conversed
with
andy
congratulating
him
on
his
success
in
getting
a
job
with
the
show
wait
about
till
the
parade
gets
off
the
grounds
he
advised
andy
scripps
the
manager
will
be
busy
till
then
you
find
him
in
the
paper
tent
andy
knew
what
that
was
the
structure
containing
the
programmes
and
general
advertising
and
posting
outfits
of
the
show
he
had
noticed
it
earlier
in
the
day
a
wagon
inside
the
tent
with
steps
and
windows
comprised
the
manager
private
office
little
midge
was
sitting
up
playing
with
some
show
children
who
had
brought
in
a
lot
of
toys
andy
went
outside
with
billy
see
here
said
the
clown
as
he
hurried
off
to
join
the
parade
tell
scripps
that
you
bunk
with
me
any
objection
i
should
say
not
you
welcome
the
general
crowd
they
put
you
with
is
a
bit
too
rough
for
a
raw
recruit
just
stand
what
they
give
you
till
we
reach
tipton
you
got
friends
enough
to
pull
you
up
into
the
rank
we
fix
you
out
there
thank
you
said
andy
he
strolled
about
with
a
happy
smile
on
his
face
prospects
looked
fine
and
andy
heart
warmed
as
he
thought
of
all
the
good
friends
he
had
made
they
a
nice
crowd
he
thought
miss
starr
marco
the
benares
brothers
the
clown
how
different
though
to
what
i
used
to
think
it
business
with
them
real
work
for
all
the
tinsel
and
glare
it
a
pleasant
business
though
and
they
must
make
a
lot
of
money
there
was
a
shrill
whistling
shriek
from
the
calliope
wagon
the
various
performers
scampered
from
their
dressing
rooms
at
the
signal
each
person
vehicle
and
animal
fell
into
line
in
the
morning
caravan
with
a
promptness
and
ease
born
of
long
practice
soon
there
was
a
fluttering
line
of
gay
color
rich
plush
hangings
uniforms
silken
flags
and
streamers
zeno
the
balloon
clown
eating
redhots
peanuts
led
the
procession
bouncing
up
and
down
on
a
rubber
globe
in
the
advance
chariot
the
bands
began
to
play
the
prancing
horses
rumbling
wagons
screaming
calliope
frolicking
tumblers
tramp
bicyclists
weaving
in
and
out
in
grotesque
costumes
often
on
one
wheel
the
tallyho
stage
filled
with
smiling
ladies
old
sultan
the
majestic
lion
gazing
in
calm
dignity
down
from
his
high
extension
cage
all
this
passed
a
fantastic
panorama
before
andy
engrossed
gaze
it
grand
decided
andy
just
grand
a
fellow
can
never
get
lonesome
here
night
or
day
i
going
to
like
it
now
for
the
manager
hope
i
do
have
any
trouble
when
andy
came
to
the
paper
tent
he
found
a
good
many
people
inside
there
were
several
performers
and
canvas
men
on
crutches
or
bandaged
up
there
were
village
merchants
with
bills
newspaper
men
after
free
passes
and
persons
seeking
employment
they
were
called
in
turn
up
the
steps
of
the
wagon
that
constituted
the
manager
office
scripps
was
a
rapid
talker
a
brisk
man
of
business
and
he
disposed
of
the
cases
presented
in
quick
order
andy
saw
four
or
five
dissipated
looking
men
discharged
at
a
word
the
applicants
for
work
were
ordered
to
appear
at
tipton
two
days
later
several
were
after
an
advance
on
their
salary
some
farmers
appeared
with
claims
for
foraging
done
by
circus
hands
finally
andy
got
to
the
front
and
tendered
the
card
harding
had
given
him
all
right
shot
out
scripps
sharply
giving
the
lad
a
keen
look
you
the
one
who
blocked
the
game
on
benares
good
for
you
remember
that
later
scripps
glanced
over
a
pasteboard
sheet
on
his
desk
first
asking
andy
his
name
and
age
and
writing
his
answers
down
in
a
book
a
day
and
keep
for
the
present
he
said
all
right
nodded
andy
it
a
start
just
so
let
me
see
ah
here
we
are
report
to
the
wild
man
of
borneo
side
top
at
twelve
yes
sir
hammer
the
big
triangle
there
till
two
then
let
me
see
again
know
how
to
ride
a
horse
oh
yes
replied
andy
eagerly
all
right
at
two
report
for
the
jockey
ring
section
at
the
horse
tent
they
hand
you
a
costume
scripps
wrote
a
number
on
a
red
ticket
and
handed
this
to
andy
his
pass
as
an
employee
just
then
a
newcomer
bundled
up
the
steps
unceremoniously
a
fussy
old
fellow
mail
in
he
announced
give
me
the
scripps
fumbled
in
a
drawer
of
his
desk
and
brought
out
a
rubber
stamp
and
pad
mind
your
eye
rip
he
observed
casting
a
scrutinizing
look
over
the
intruder
which
eye
demanded
the
old
fellow
the
one
that
sees
a
bottle
and
glass
the
quickest
h
grumbled
ripley
or
rip
van
winkle
as
he
was
familiarly
known
by
the
show
people
my
eyes
are
all
right
do
fret
i
been
twenty
years
with
this
here
show
man
and
boy
yes
yes
we
know
all
about
that
interrupted
scripps
seasoned
right
enough
do
leave
the
rig
to
come
home
without
a
driver
though
and
money
letters
aboard
as
you
did
last
week
here
is
a
new
hand
break
him
in
to
keep
his
time
employed
ripley
viewed
andy
with
some
disfavor
evidently
he
regarded
him
as
a
sort
of
guardian
andy
however
silently
followed
him
outside
ripley
soon
reached
a
close
vehicle
boarded
up
back
of
the
seat
and
with
two
doors
at
the
rear
a
mottled
horse
once
evidently
a
beauty
was
between
the
shafts
as
andy
lifted
himself
to
the
seat
beside
ripley
the
latter
made
a
peculiar
purring
lute
he
did
not
even
take
up
the
reins
the
horse
with
a
neigh
and
a
frisky
dance
movement
of
the
forefeet
started
up
right
left
slow
lute
turn
now
go
ripley
gave
a
dozen
directions
within
the
next
five
minutes
he
was
showing
off
for
andy
benefit
the
latter
was
in
fact
pleased
the
animal
obeyed
every
direction
with
a
precision
and
intelligence
that
fairly
amazed
the
boy
finally
getting
to
a
clear
course
outside
the
circus
tangle
ripley
took
up
the
reins
he
set
his
lips
and
uttered
two
sharp
whistles
ending
in
a
kind
of
hiss
andy
was
very
nearly
jerked
out
of
his
seat
he
had
to
hold
on
to
its
side
bar
for
about
five
hundred
yards
the
horse
took
a
sprint
that
knocked
off
his
cap
and
fairly
took
his
breath
away
say
he
great
andy
exclaimed
irrepressibly
as
ripley
slowed
down
again
i
guess
so
nodded
the
latter
aroused
out
of
his
crustiness
by
enthusiasm
that
lucille
was
famous
once
past
her
prime
a
little
now
but
when
her
old
driver
has
the
reins
she
do
forget
does
she
ripley
took
a
turn
into
a
side
street
and
finally
halted
giving
andy
the
reins
got
to
order
something
he
said
andy
saw
him
enter
a
store
but
only
to
leave
it
by
a
side
door
and
cross
an
alley
into
a
saloon
ripley
tried
to
appear
very
when
he
came
back
to
the
wagon
but
andy
caught
the
taint
of
liquor
in
his
breath
twice
again
the
circus
veteran
made
stops
in
the
same
manner
he
became
quite
chatty
and
confidential
ripley
explained
to
andy
that
he
went
regularly
for
the
circus
mail
at
each
town
where
the
show
stopped
postmasters
kick
with
five
hundred
strangers
calling
for
their
mail
he
explained
so
we
always
forward
a
list
of
the
employees
this
mail
just
before
pay
day
when
the
crowd
is
usually
hard
up
brings
a
good
many
money
letters
from
friends
that
rubber
stamp
you
saw
the
manager
give
me
all
the
registered
cards
at
the
post
office
once
the
wagon
was
robbed
the
looters
made
quite
a
haul
not
when
i
was
on
duty
though
at
a
drug
store
ripley
got
several
packages
and
some
more
at
a
general
merchandise
store
finally
they
reached
the
post
office
and
ripley
drove
around
to
a
sort
of
hitching
alley
at
its
side
come
with
me
to
see
how
we
do
things
he
invited
andy
bring
along
those
two
mail
bags
andy
had
already
noticed
the
bags
one
was
quite
large
it
was
made
of
canvas
with
a
snap
lock
the
other
was
of
leather
and
smaller
in
size
swinging
these
over
his
shoulder
ripley
entered
the
he
showed
his
credentials
from
the
circus
and
was
admitted
behind
the
letter
cases
of
the
places
andy
watched
him
receive
over
a
hundred
letters
and
packages
receipting
for
the
same
on
registry
delivery
cards
this
lot
he
placed
in
the
small
leather
bag
the
ordinary
mail
lay
sorted
out
for
the
circus
on
a
stamping
table
this
went
into
the
big
canvas
pouch
the
circus
newspaper
mail
was
ready
tagged
in
a
hempen
sack
ripley
carried
this
out
to
andy
toss
it
in
the
wagon
he
ordered
following
with
the
letter
pouches
andy
opened
the
back
doors
of
the
wagon
and
tossed
in
the
newspaper
bag
say
back
in
a
minute
observed
ripley
depositing
his
own
burdens
on
the
front
wagon
seat
andy
stood
watching
him
ripley
rounded
a
corner
in
the
alley
where
a
wooden
finger
indicated
a
side
entrance
to
a
hotel
bar
ripley
failing
was
manifest
and
andy
decided
that
he
did
indeed
need
a
guardian
the
wagon
stood
on
a
space
quite
secluded
from
the
street
near
the
entrance
to
the
alley
several
men
were
lounging
about
andy
carried
the
leather
pouch
with
him
as
he
went
around
to
the
open
doors
at
the
rear
of
the
wagon
he
climbed
in
and
stowed
the
newspaper
bag
and
what
packages
they
had
already
collected
in
a
tidy
pile
ripley
had
indicated
that
there
was
quite
a
miscellaneous
load
to
pick
up
about
town
before
they
returned
to
the
circus
andy
was
thus
employed
when
the
rear
doors
came
together
with
a
sharp
snap
they
shut
him
in
a
close
prisoner
for
they
were
on
the
outside
only
andy
in
complete
darkness
now
groped
back
to
the
doors
he
heard
quick
suppressed
tones
outside
the
vehicle
jolted
some
one
had
jumped
to
the
front
seat
a
whip
snapped
old
lute
started
up
with
a
bound
throwing
andy
off
his
footing
send
her
spinning
reached
him
in
a
muffled
voice
from
the
front
seat
jump
with
the
bag
when
we
turn
that
old
shed
answered
other
tones
why
say
there
only
one
mail
bag
i
saw
them
bring
out
two
i
am
dead
sure
of
it
and
this
is
only
common
letters
how
do
you
know
jim
tapp
described
them
the
leather
one
he
says
got
the
money
mail
in
it
then
where
is
it
the
kid
must
have
it
inside
the
wagon
yes
whoa
with
a
sharp
jerk
the
horse
was
pulled
to
a
halt
andy
heard
the
two
men
on
the
seat
jump
to
the
ground
he
knew
that
their
motive
was
robbery
he
knew
further
that
this
was
another
plot
of
bad
jim
tapp
the
friend
and
associate
of
criminals
in
another
minute
the
men
would
open
the
wagon
doors
pull
him
out
perhaps
assault
him
take
the
registered
mail
and
fly
andy
had
only
a
second
to
act
in
he
theorized
that
the
wagon
following
the
alley
was
now
probably
halted
in
some
secluded
side
lane
to
escape
the
clutches
of
the
robbers
was
everything
andy
having
no
weapon
of
defence
was
no
match
for
them
if
the
rig
once
reaches
the
crowded
streets
i
safe
thought
andy
then
he
carried
out
a
speedy
programme
forming
his
lips
in
a
pucker
as
he
had
seen
ripley
do
andy
uttered
two
sharp
whistles
then
a
clear
resounding
hiss
thunder
yelled
a
voice
outside
ouch
echoed
a
second
the
horse
had
given
one
wild
prodigious
bound
at
hearing
the
familiar
signal
the
vehicle
must
have
grazed
one
of
the
thieves
its
front
wheels
knocked
the
other
down
my
i
in
for
it
instantly
decided
andy
for
swayed
from
side
to
side
he
realized
that
the
circus
wagon
was
dashing
forward
at
runaway
speed
chapter
xvii
a
wild
journey
andy
wildwood
found
himself
in
a
box
in
more
ways
than
one
judging
from
the
sounds
he
had
heard
the
men
bent
on
securing
the
registered
mail
pouch
had
been
baffled
the
old
circus
horse
had
started
on
a
sudden
and
surprisingly
swift
sprint
from
the
feeling
of
turns
jerks
and
swings
andy
decided
that
within
four
minutes
the
rig
had
left
the
fully
to
the
rear
i
started
the
horse
all
right
said
andy
old
ripley
signal
has
acted
like
a
charm
how
to
stop
the
animal
though
that
is
the
present
question
andy
ran
at
the
two
rear
doors
of
the
wagon
he
steadied
himself
arms
extended
so
as
to
touch
either
side
of
the
box
then
he
gave
the
doors
a
tremendous
kick
with
the
sole
of
his
shoe
the
doors
did
not
budge
he
felt
over
their
inner
surfaces
where
they
came
together
the
lock
was
set
in
the
wood
they
could
be
opened
only
from
the
outside
the
wagon
box
had
one
aperture
andy
discovered
this
was
a
small
ventilating
grating
up
in
one
corner
above
the
seat
he
sprang
up
on
the
newspaper
bag
this
brought
his
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
grating
it
was
about
four
by
six
inches
with
slanting
slats
andy
could
see
down
at
the
horse
and
ahead
along
the
road
he
grew
excited
and
somewhat
uneasy
as
he
looked
out
lute
was
a
sight
for
a
race
track
her
head
down
mane
flowing
tail
extended
she
was
covering
the
ground
with
tremendous
strides
farther
back
on
the
route
andy
had
felt
the
wagon
collide
with
curbs
and
with
other
vehicles
once
there
was
a
crash
and
a
yell
and
he
felt
sure
they
had
taken
a
wheel
off
a
rig
they
passed
now
however
they
appeared
to
be
quite
clear
of
the
town
proper
the
road
ahead
was
a
slanting
one
a
steep
grade
fully
long
led
to
a
stone
bridge
crossing
a
river
it
was
so
steep
that
andy
wondered
that
lute
did
not
stumble
the
wagon
wheels
ground
and
slid
so
that
the
vehicle
lifted
at
the
rear
as
if
its
own
momentum
would
cause
a
sudden
we
never
reach
the
bottom
of
the
hill
decided
andy
my
going
he
shouted
out
words
of
direction
to
the
horse
he
had
heard
ripley
employ
lute
did
not
hear
at
least
did
not
heed
andy
remembered
now
that
in
stopping
the
horse
ripley
had
used
the
reins
he
held
his
breath
as
striking
a
rut
the
wagon
bounded
up
in
the
air
he
clung
for
dear
life
with
one
hand
clutching
the
ventilator
bars
as
the
vehicle
was
flung
sideways
over
ten
feet
threatening
to
snap
off
the
wheels
which
bent
and
cracked
on
their
axles
at
the
terrific
strain
contrary
to
andy
anticipations
they
neared
the
bottom
of
the
hill
without
a
mishap
suddenly
however
he
gave
a
shout
a
new
danger
threatened
the
bridge
had
large
stone
posts
where
it
began
then
a
frail
wooden
railing
was
its
only
side
protection
the
roadway
was
not
very
broad
two
full
loads
of
hay
could
never
have
passed
one
another
on
that
bridge
there
a
team
coming
breathed
andy
we
collide
sure
whoa
whoa
he
yelled
through
the
grating
no
use
it
a
smash
and
a
bad
one
andy
fixed
a
distressed
glance
on
the
team
across
the
bridge
a
collision
was
inevitable
lute
striking
the
level
only
increased
her
already
terrific
rate
of
speed
andy
took
heart
however
as
she
swerved
to
one
side
the
intelligent
animal
appeared
to
enjoy
her
wild
runaway
and
wanted
to
keep
it
up
apparently
she
aimed
to
keep
precisely
to
her
own
side
of
the
road
and
avoid
a
collision
the
driver
of
the
team
coming
had
jumped
from
his
seat
and
pulled
his
rig
to
the
very
edge
of
the
planking
all
might
have
gone
well
but
for
a
slight
miscalculation
as
lute
feet
struck
the
bridge
plankway
she
pressed
close
to
the
right
the
wagon
swerved
the
front
end
of
the
box
landed
squarely
against
the
stone
post
the
shock
was
a
stunning
one
it
tore
the
wagon
shafts
harness
and
all
clear
off
the
horse
with
a
circling
twist
the
vehicle
reversed
like
lightning
the
box
struck
the
wooden
rail
this
snapped
like
a
pipe
stem
lute
dashed
on
like
a
whirlwind
the
driver
of
the
other
team
staring
in
appalled
wonder
the
box
slid
clear
of
the
plankway
and
went
whirling
to
the
river
bed
fifteen
feet
below
andy
was
thrown
from
side
to
side
then
as
the
wagon
landed
a
new
crash
and
a
new
shock
dazed
his
wits
completely
he
was
hurled
the
length
of
the
box
his
head
fortunately
striking
where
the
newspaper
bag
intervened
judging
from
the
concussion
andy
decided
that
the
wagon
box
had
landed
on
a
big
rock
in
the
river
bed
there
it
remained
stationary
he
struggled
to
an
upright
position
one
arm
was
badly
wrenched
his
face
was
grazed
and
bleeding
if
i
do
get
out
some
way
he
panted
i
drown
it
looked
that
way
he
felt
a
great
spurt
of
water
pouring
in
rapidly
when
the
ventilator
dipped
under
the
surface
then
too
the
crash
had
wrenched
the
box
structure
at
various
seams
water
was
forcing
its
way
in
bottom
sides
and
top
from
to
andy
stood
helpless
then
locating
the
door
end
of
the
vehicle
he
drew
back
and
massed
all
his
muscle
for
a
supreme
effort
shoulders
first
andy
posed
and
then
threw
himself
forward
fashion
he
felt
he
must
act
and
that
quickly
or
else
the
worst
might
be
his
own
chapter
xviii
a
freak
of
nature
the
doors
at
the
rear
of
the
wagon
box
gave
way
as
andy
body
met
their
inner
surface
with
full
force
he
stood
now
on
a
slant
his
body
submerged
to
the
waist
the
box
had
crashed
on
top
of
one
big
flat
rock
in
the
river
bed
and
had
tilted
on
this
foundation
against
another
upright
rock
but
for
this
it
might
have
gone
clear
under
water
or
floated
down
stream
and
andy
might
have
been
drowned
all
through
his
stirring
runaway
experience
andy
had
kept
possession
of
the
registered
mail
pouch
it
was
still
slung
from
his
shoulder
as
he
gazed
around
him
he
was
careful
lest
he
disturb
the
equilibrium
of
the
wreck
he
found
out
now
that
the
door
hinges
had
been
knocked
clear
off
and
the
frame
badly
wrenched
in
its
fall
hello
hello
shouted
an
excited
voice
overhead
hello
yourself
sang
back
andy
looking
up
the
driver
of
the
team
into
which
the
runaway
had
so
nearly
dashed
stood
looking
down
from
the
bridge
planking
his
eyes
stared
wide
as
andy
suddenly
appeared
like
a
was
you
in
there
gulped
the
man
i
was
nowhere
else
answered
andy
say
mister
where
that
horse
oh
he
all
right
see
him
the
man
pointed
along
the
other
shore
of
the
river
bank
lute
had
crossed
the
bridge
she
had
now
taken
herself
to
some
marshy
grass
stretches
and
was
grazing
placidly
andy
was
about
twenty
feet
from
the
shore
he
could
nearly
make
it
by
jumping
from
rock
to
rock
he
thought
at
one
or
two
places
however
the
current
ran
strong
and
deep
and
he
saw
that
he
might
have
to
do
some
swimming
see
here
he
called
up
to
the
man
on
the
bridge
have
you
got
a
rope
yes
nodded
the
man
long
enough
to
reach
down
here
i
guess
so
let
try
wait
a
minute
he
went
to
his
wagon
shortly
he
dropped
a
new
stout
rope
used
in
securing
hay
loads
it
had
length
and
to
spare
andy
tied
the
mail
pouch
to
its
end
then
he
groped
under
water
in
the
wagon
box
he
managed
to
fish
out
the
various
parcels
it
held
including
the
newspaper
bag
these
he
sent
up
first
then
the
man
at
the
other
end
braced
the
cable
against
a
railing
post
andy
came
up
the
rope
with
agility
he
stamped
and
shook
the
water
from
his
soaked
shoes
and
clothing
the
mail
bag
he
again
suspended
across
his
shoulders
hi
another
runaway
suddenly
exclaimed
his
companion
andy
traced
an
increasing
clatter
of
a
horse
hoofs
and
wagon
wheels
to
a
rig
descending
the
hill
at
breakneck
speed
no
he
said
it
ripley
who
he
the
man
who
drove
that
wagon
stop
stop
cried
andy
springing
into
the
middle
of
the
bridge
roadway
and
waving
his
arms
the
rig
came
up
it
was
driven
by
a
man
wearing
a
badge
andy
decided
he
was
some
local
police
officer
ripley
was
fearfully
excited
and
his
face
showed
it
what
did
you
do
with
that
wagon
sputtered
ripley
jumping
to
the
plankway
andy
pointed
down
at
the
river
bed
and
then
at
the
distant
horse
briefly
as
he
could
he
narrated
what
had
occurred
ripley
nearly
had
a
fit
he
instantly
realized
that
whoever
was
to
blame
for
the
runaway
it
was
not
andy
where
the
mail
he
asked
there
the
newspaper
bag
said
andy
here
the
registered
mail
pouch
those
thieves
took
the
other
bag
of
mail

wo

said
andy
ripley
groaned
and
wrung
his
hands
he
was
in
a
frenzy
of
distress
and
indecision
see
here
spoke
the
officer
to
him
you

packages

you
held
on
to
that
registered
stuff
ripley
started
after
the
runaway
horse
the
officer
hurried
townwards
questioning
andy
closely
he
stopped
at
the
and
made
some
inquiries
among
the
crowd
loitering
about
its
vicinity
then
he
drove
to
the
town
hall
went
into
his
office
jumped
in
the
buggy
again
and
they
proceeded
toward
the
circus
i
got
a
vague
description
of
your
two
men
he
told
andy
but
that
is
much
with
so
many
strangers
in
town
you
think
they
are
partners
of
that
rapp
whom
the
circus
people
know
tapp
jim
tapp
corrected
andy
yes

mentioned
his
name
the
circus
detectives

to
handle
this
case
then
said
the
village
officer
i
better
see
them
right
away
the
manager
of
the
show
regarded
andy
in
some
wonderment
as
he
and
the
officer
unceremoniously
entered
his
presence
his
excitement
increased
as
andy
recited
his
story
i
warned
ripley
he
exclaimed
well

spoiled
pet

longer

answered
andy
promptly
andy
saw
that
he
had
made
a
good
impression
on
the
manager
the
latter
was
pleased
with
him
and
interested
in
him
andy
waited
outside
the
tent
soon
the
village
officer
and
two
of
the
circus
detectives
sought
him
out
these
latter
questioned
him
on
their
own
behalf
daley
murdock
and
tapp
are
in
this
one
of
them
remarked
definitely
they
have
got
much
this
time
the
next
break
though
may
be
for
the
ticket
wagon
they
got
to
be
squelched
andy
put
in
a
busy
pleasant
day
he
was
getting
acquainted
he
was
becoming
versed
in
general
circus
detail
for
an
hour
he
hammered
the
huge
triangle
in
front
of
a
side
show
as
directed
at
the
afternoon
rehearsal
he
was
one
of
twenty
dressed
like
jockeys
in
the
ring
parade
afterwards
andy
was
making
for
the
clown
tent
when
a
fat
perspiring
fellow
aproned
as
a
cook
hailed
him

to
show
he
asked

a
frying
pan

andy
proudly

time
there
a
hatchet

stuff

all
burning
up
inside
a
hissing
splutter
of
his
ovens
made
the
cook
dive
into
his
tent
andy
picked
up
a
chisel
dropped
by
the
cook
he
opened
six
casks
standing
on
the
ground
and
carried
them
inside
the
cooking
odor
pervading
the
place
was
very
pleasing
the
assistants
were
few
some
of
the
regulars
were
absent
andy
guessed
from
what
he
heard
the
cook
say
the
latter
was
rushed
to
death
and
jumping
from
stove
to
stove
and
utensil
to
utensil
in
a
great
flutter
of
excitement
and
haste
for
he
was
behind
in
his
work
andy
caught
on
to
the
situation
in
a
swift
quiet
way
he
anticipated
the
cook
needs
he
dipped
and
dried
some
skillets
near
a
trough
of
water
he
sharpened
some
knives
he
carried
some
charcoal
hods
nearer
to
a
stove
needing
replenishing
after
awhile
the
cook
began
to
whistle
cheerily
his
perplexities
were
lessening
and
he
felt
good
humored
over
it
things
in
running
order
he
chirped
you
a
game
lad
hold
on
a
minute
the
cook
emptied
out
a
smoking
pan
into
which
he
had
placed
a
mass
of
batter
a
few
minutes
previous
do
burn
yourself
it
piping
hot
he
observed
tendering
andy
a
tempting
raisin
cake
enough
for
two
meals
oh
thank
you
said
andy
thank
you
lad
whenever
you
need
a
bite
between
meals
just
drop
in
andy
came
out
of
the
tent
passing
the
cake
from
hand
to
hand
he
caught
a
newspaper
sheet
fluttering
by
wadded
it
up
and
surmounted
it
with
the
hot
cake
that
better
he
said
my
it
looks
appetizing
beg
pardon
added
andy
as
rounding
a
tent
he
ran
against
a
boy
about
his
own
age
at
a
glance
he
saw
that
the
stranger
did
not
belong
to
the
show
he
was
poorly
dressed
but
and
although
he
limped
like
a
person
who
had
walked
too
far
and
too
long
for
comfort
my
fault
said
the
stranger
i
done
nothing
but
gape
since
i
came
here
say
this
circus
is
a
regular
city
in
itself
is
it
yes
answered
andy
stranger
here
the
boy
nodded
he
studied
andy
face
quite
anxiously
look
here
he
said
you
look
honest
some
lemonade
boys
i
asked
sent
me
astray
with
all
kinds
of
wrong
information
you
wo
will
you
certainly
not
said
andy
what
the
trouble
is
it
hard
to
get
a
talk
with
the
circus
manager
why
no
is
it
hard
to
join
the
show
i
have
just
joined
said
andy
is
that
so
exclaimed
the
stranger
brightening
up
was
it
hard
to
get
in
not
particularly
what
did
you
expect
to
do
anything
for
a
start
responded
the
other
eagerly
only
my
ambition
is
to
be
an
animal
trainer
andy
became
quite
interested
why
that
he
inquired
because
it
seems
to
be
my
bent
my
name
is
luke
belding
i
an
orphan
been
brought
up
on
a
stock
farm
and
know
all
about
horses
and
say
added
the
speaker
with
intense
eagerness
if
they
take
me
on
throw
in
a
great
curiosity
he
held
out
what
looked
like
a
wooden
cage
covered
with
a
piece
of
cloth
got
it
in
there
have
you
asked
andy
yes
i
trained
it
and
it
cute
honest
it
better
as
a
curiosity
and
to
make
people
laugh
than
a
lot
of
the
novelties
they
have
in
the
side
tents
why
said
andy
with
increasing
interest
what
may
it
be
now
well
answered
luke
it
a
chicken
oh
i
suppose
or
something
of
that
sort
not
at
all
no
said
luke
belding
this
is
something
you
never
saw
before
it
a
chicken
that
walks
backward
chapter
xix
called
to
account
andy
burst
out
laughing
he
could
not
help
it
that
strange
he
said
a
chicken
that
walks
backward
yes
answered
luke
belding
soberly
really
does
it
oh
sure
all
the
time
i
got
it
here
i
show
you
luke
made
a
move
as
if
to
remove
the
cloth
cover
from
the
box
under
his
arm
but
andy
stopped
him
hold
on
he
said
come
with
me
till
i
get
rid
of
this
cake
and
then
you
shall
show
me
h
observed
luke
smacking
his
lips
with
a
longing
look
at
the
cake
it
would
take
me
long
to
get
rid
of
it
hungry
insinuated
andy
desperately
i
be
almost
tempted
to
sell
a
in
the
chicken
for
a
good
square
meal
you
shall
have
one
without
any
such
sacrifice
declared
andy
come
along
they
found
the
clown
tent
empty
billy
blow
is
probably
giving
midget
an
airing
said
andy
half
to
himself
who
billy
blow
inquired
luke
the
clown
do
you
know
a
real
live
clown
say
that
great
said
luke
must
keep
a
fellow
laughing
all
the
time
i
thought
so
until
yesterday
answered
andy
but
no
they
have
their
troubles
like
other
people
this
poor
sorrowful
fellow
has
his
fill
of
it
he
do
do
much
laughing
outside
of
the
ring
i
can
tell
you
there
we
enjoy
the
cook
gift
together
andy
drew
up
the
bench
and
handed
luke
fully
of
the
toothsome
dainty
it
pleased
him
to
see
the
boy
enjoy
the
feast
luke
poked
a
piece
of
the
sake
under
the
cage
cover
there
was
a
gladsome
cluck
two
of
us
happy
announced
luke
with
a
smile
that
won
andy
heart
andy
decided
that
his
new
acquaintance
was
the
right
sort
luke
had
a
clear
honest
face
and
there
was
something
in
his
eye
that
inspired
confidence
now
then
said
andy
as
his
companion
munched
the
last
crumb
of
the
cake
let
see
your
wonderful
curiosity
i
do
it
replied
luke
with
alacrity
find
me
a
little
stick
or
switch
will
you
andy
went
outside
to
hunt
for
the
required
article
as
he
returned
with
a
stake
splinter
he
observed
that
luke
had
uncovered
and
set
down
the
cage
which
was
a
rude
wooden
affair
near
it
with
a
pertly
cocked
head
and
magnificently
red
feathers
stood
a
small
rooster
luke
took
the
stick
from
andy
hand
walk
bolivar
he
ordered
andy
began
to
laugh
it
was
a
comical
sight
the
rooster
went
strutting
around
the
tent
backwards
as
rapidly
and
steadily
as
a
normal
chicken
it
was
ludicrous
to
watch
it
proceed
pecking
at
the
ground
and
turning
corners
now
then
bolivar
said
luke
he
used
the
stick
to
direct
the
rooster
which
kept
time
first
with
one
foot
and
then
the
other
to
a
tune
whistled
by
its
owner
ending
with
a
triple
pirouette
that
was
superb
well
that
fine
commented
andy
with
enthusiasm
how
did
you
ever
train
it
did
responded
luke
frankly
except
for
the
dancing
i
done
that
with
crows
and
goats
many
a
time
see
here
and
he
picked
up
the
chicken
and
extended
its
feet
why
cried
andy
it
was
born
with
its
claws
turned
backwards
that
it
nodded
luke
see
a
regular
freak
of
nature
odd
enough
to
put
among
the
curiosities
it
certainly
is
voted
andy
the
circus
would
use
it
though
just
a
side
show
i
do
care
said
luke
as
long
as
i
get
started
in
with
the
show
can
you
help
me
i
try
to
declared
andy
wait
here
i
want
to
find
billy
blow
and
tell
him
about
this
andy
went
about
the
circus
grounds
until
he
discovered
the
clown
billy
was
quite
taken
with
the
chicken
and
finally
decided
to
try
and
place
the
boy
with
his
freak
he
and
luke
went
away
together
when
he
came
back
the
clown
was
alone
he
told
andy
that
one
of
the
side
shows
had
agreed
to
try
luke
and
his
wonderful
chicken
for
at
least
a
week
for
the
food
and
keep
of
both
andy
went
on
with
the
jockey
riders
in
the
evening
performance
the
last
performance
at
clifton
was
the
next
forenoon
he
had
only
a
glimpse
of
marco
and
others
of
his
acquaintance
meantime
with
everything
on
a
rush
you
see
tipton
is
a
regular
vacation
for
us
folks
billy
blow
explained
to
him
country
around
is
populous
enough
for
more
than
one
day
performances
and
then
only
when
the
county
fair
is
on
we
rest
two
days
and
play
saturday
then
is
your
chance
there
a
good
deal
of
shifting
and
taking
on
new
hands
we
watch
out
for
you
you
see
some
fun
too
all
the
new
aspirants
have
been
told
to
show
up
at
tipton
are
there
many
about
five
to
every
town
we
played
in
declared
billy
they
all
want
to
break
in
and
it
policy
to
give
them
a
show
andy
was
sent
off
by
the
manager
to
the
superintendent
of
the
moving
crew
about
noon
there
was
considerable
lifting
to
do
andy
was
tired
when
about
six
in
the
evening
he
climbed
up
on
a
loaded
wagon
for
the
ride
to
tipton
he
had
met
one
of
the
circus
detectives
that
morning
who
told
him
they
had
so
far
discovered
no
trace
of
jim
tapp
or
his
colleagues
or
the
stolen
mail
bag
they
got
to
tipton
about
eight
in
the
evening
andy
was
told
off
to
help
in
the
construction
work
the
next
morning
and
had
now
twelve
hours
of
his
own
time
he
was
hungry
and
knowing
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
much
to
eat
until
late
when
the
cook
quarters
had
been
he
left
the
wagon
as
it
reached
the
principal
street
in
tipton
andy
went
to
a
restaurant
and
got
a
good
meal
he
decided
to
stroll
about
a
bit
and
then
join
the
clown
in
his
new
quarters
andy
had
been
to
tipton
before
his
aunt
had
some
acquaintances
there
he
walked
up
and
down
the
principal
street
looking
in
the
store
windows
and
studying
the
country
people
who
had
come
to
visit
the
county
fair
suddenly
andy
drew
back
into
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
leaning
against
a
curb
hitching
post
was
a
person
who
enchained
his
attention
it
tapp
jim
tapp
said
andy
i
know
that
slouch
of
his
shoulders
anywhere
the
person
under
his
inspection
was
swinging
a
light
bamboo
cane
and
smoking
a
cigarette
he
wore
a
jet
black
moustache
and
a
jet
black
speck
of
a
goatee
moustache
and
goatee
were
unmistakably
of
the
variety
andy
had
seen
a
circus
fakir
selling
for
cents
back
at
clifton
their
wearer
kept
his
back
to
the
lighted
windows
so
that
his
face
was
in
partial
shadow
he
also
kept
taking
sidelong
glances
up
and
down
the
curb
as
if
expecting
some
one
andy
watched
him
for
fully
five
minutes
made
up
his
mind
and
at
last
stealthily
glided
up
behind
him
seizing
both
the
fellow
arms
he
whirled
him
around
face
to
face
let
go
of
him
and
with
two
quick
movements
of
one
hand
tore
the
false
moustache
and
the
false
goatee
from
his
face
his
surmises
were
correct
it
was
jim
tapp
the
latter
gave
andy
a
quick
startled
glance
wildwood
he
said
and
switched
his
cane
towards
andy
face
no
you
do
cried
andy
grasping
his
arms
again
jim
tapp
the
circus
people
want
you
let
go
nobody
wants
me
i
done
nothing
call
benares
brothers
the
stake
your
partner
hit
me
with
the
stolen
mail
bag
nothing
demanded
andy
you
come
along
with
me
or
call
the
police
tapp
glanced
sharply
about
so
far
nobody
seemed
to
particularly
notice
them
he
threw
out
his
own
arms
and
grasped
andy
in
turn
thus
interlocked
he
threw
out
a
foot
andy
was
taken
off
his
guard
he
went
toppling
but
he
never
let
go
of
his
antagonist
both
landed
with
a
crash
on
the
board
sidewalk
there
was
a
vacant
lot
just
next
to
a
brilliantly
lighted
store
as
they
took
a
roll
they
landed
nearly
at
the
inner
edge
of
the
walk
there
panted
andy
you
wo
trip
me
again
he
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
and
got
tapp
on
his
back
sitting
astride
of
him
andy
caught
both
hands
at
the
wrists
let
go
panted
tapp
say
do
draw
a
crowd
i
go
with
you

with
a
policeman
declared
andy
glancing
along
the
walk
there
be
one
here
soon
for
the
crowd
coming
fight
fight
yelled
three
or
four
urchins
dashing
up
to
the
spot
others
came
hurrying
along
from
inspecting
the
store
windows
what
the
row
demanded
a
man
fair
fight
let
him
up
give
him
a
chance
growled
a
fellow
also
approaching
what
is
it
what
is
it
inquired
a
fussy
old
lady
craning
her
neck
towards
the
combatants
say
ground
out
tapp
vainly
endeavoring
to
free
himself
let
me
up
it
will
pay
you
say
i
can
tell
you
something
great
can
you
smiled
andy
calmly
tell
it
to
the
police
hold
on
proceeded
tapp
i
not
fooling
i
know
something
i
can
put
you
on
to
something
big
how
big
insinuated
andy
disbelievingly
i
can
i
vow
i
can
i
in
dead
earnest
say
wildwood
nobody
knows
it
but
me
you

heir

guess
your
heir

all
hot
air
ah

comes
the
policeman
oh
gracious
my
aunt
andy
wildwood
let
go
his
hold
of
jim
tapp
with
startled
eyes
in
sheer
dismay
he
stared
at
a
woman
approaching
them
her
curiosity
aroused
by
the
crowd
it
was
his
aunt
miss
lavinia
talcott
chapter
xx
andy
escape
jim
tapp
gave
a
great
wriggle
as
andy
involuntarily
let
go
his
hold
of
the
young
rascal
his
eyes
twinkled
and
followed
the
glance
of
andy
own
tapp
was
too
keen
a
fellow
not
to
observe
that
andy
was
startled
and
unnerved
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
some
one
on
the
scene
he
probably
caught
the
words
spoken
by
andy
my
aunt
and
presumably
identified
miss
lavinia
talcott
as
the
cause
of
the
boy
disquietude
further
jim
tapp
knew
that
andy
had
run
away
from
home
and
had
been
sought
for
by
the
police
as
it
turned
out
later
in
andy
career
jim
tapp
knew
a
great
deal
more
than
all
this
put
together
in
fact
he
knew
some
things
of
which
andy
never
dreamed
andy
had
been
completely
driven
off
his
balance
at
the
sight
of
his
aunt
it
was
natural
that
she
should
be
at
tipton
she
went
there
quite
often
loneliness
at
home
and
the
variety
of
the
county
fair
at
tipton
had
probably
induced
her
to
make
the
present
visit
instantly
andy
thought
of
but
one
thing
to
escape
recognition
still
the
minute
he
let
go
of
tapp
his
presence
of
mind
returned
and
he
was
sorry
he
had
lost
his
nerve
on
an
impulse
it
would
have
been
quite
an
easy
thing
to
roll
and
force
his
antagonist
over
the
sidewalk
edge
now
however
tapp
had
wriggled
past
his
reach
andy
made
one
grab
for
him
prostrate
on
the
planks
now
missed
rolled
along
and
dropped
squarely
over
the
inner
edge
of
the
walk
five
feet
down
into
the
vacant
lot
below
she
did
see
me
he
panted
i
sure
she
did
too
bad
though
i
had
that
fellow
tapp
tight
why
should
i
lose
him
even
now
andy
ran
under
the
sidewalk
for
about
ten
feet
he
rounded
a
heap
of
sand
and
glided
up
a
slant
where
an
alley
cut
in
there
he
paused
hidden
by
a
big
billboard
peering
past
this
barrier
he
could
view
the
crowd
he
had
just
left
thief
stop
thief
fell
in
a
frantic
yell
on
his
hearers
to
his
surprise
it
was
jim
tapp
who
uttered
the
call
he
was
flinging
about
in
great
excitement
as
a
police
officer
ran
up
andy
saw
him
pointing
into
the
vacant
lot
he
also
evidently
told
some
specious
story
to
the
officer
the
latter
jumped
into
the
lot
and
two
or
three
followed
him
andy
saw
that
he
was
in
danger
of
discovery
and
directed
a
last
glance
at
the
crowd
on
the
sidewalk
he
saw
his
aunt
bobbing
bonnet
retreating
from
the
scene
he
also
saw
jim
tapp
apparently
following
her
he
did
not
dare
to
go
in
the
same
direction
andy
dodged
down
the
alley
and
came
out
on
the
next
street
he
looked
vainly
for
the
two
persons
in
whom
he
was
interested
he
failed
to
locate
them
and
then
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
the
circus
grounds
he
was
very
thoughtful
and
in
a
measure
worried
and
uneasy
tapp
is
pretty
smart
soliloquized
andy
he
mean
too
if
he
noticed
that
i
was
flustered
and
afraid
of
aunt
lavinia
seeing
me
and
guesses
who
she
is
and
connects
my
running
away
from
home
with
her
he
would
tell
her
where
i
am
just
out
of
spite
wonder
if
she
could
have
me
arrested
here
in
another
state
andy
was
too
tired
to
stay
awake
over
this
problem
when
he
located
the
clown
new
quarters
before
he
retired
however
he
got
word
to
the
circus
manager
that
jim
tapp
was
evidently
following
the
circus
and
had
been
seen
in
tipton
that
very
evening
the
next
morning
andy
was
too
busy
to
give
the
matter
of
his
aunt
near
proximity
much
thought
he
worked
with
a
gang
hoisting
the
main
tent
until
nearly
noon
hi
wildwood
hailed
a
friendly
voice
as
andy
was
leaving
the
tent
an
hour
later
the
speaker
was
marco
he
made
a
few
inquiries
as
to
how
andy
was
getting
along
then
he
said
i
saw
miss
stella
starr
this
morning
you
know
the
manager
of
course
scripps
yes
nodded
andy
well
about
two
they
going
to
line
up
the
amateurs
in
the
performance
tent
you
be
there
all
right
said
andy
benares
and
thacher
will

the
motto

declared
marco
when
andy
went
to
the
performers
tent
at
two
he
found
over
fifty
persons
there
in
its
centre
a
balancing
bar
had
been
put
up
an
old
circus
horse
stood
at
one
side
some
low
trapezes
were
swung
from
a
post
a
number
of
the
circus
people
were
lounging
on
benches
in
one
corner
of
the
tent
in
another
corner
on
other
benches
some
twenty
persons
mostly
boys
were
gathered
here

benares
the
trapezist

andy
beside
him
as
he
passed
along
your
turn

come
after
they
get
rid
of
those
aspirants
yonder
chapter
xxi
a
acrobat
the
circus
manager
sat
in
a
chair
at
the
edge
of
a
little
sawdust
ring
that
had
been
marked
out
for
the
occasion
the
ringmaster
stood
near
him
in
charge
of
the
ceremonies
now
then
my
friends
observed
this
individual
in
a
sharp
snappy
way
you
people
want
a
chance
to
get
on
as
performers
that
good
we
are
always
looking
for
fresh
talent
show
your
paces
who
first
a
big
loutish
fellow
with
an
ungainly
walk
stepped
forward
he
was
wrapped
up
in
a
tarpaulin
as
he
let
it
drop
it
was
like
a
transformation
scene
it
seemed
that
some
of
the
mischievous
candy
peddlers
had
got
hold
of
him
they
had
induced
him
to
appear
for
trial
in
costume
he
wore
a
pair
of
tights
three
sizes
too
small
for
him
they
had
powdered
his
hair
with
fine
sawdust
and
daubed
his
face
with
chalk
and
dyes
they
had
stuffed
out
his
stockings
until
his
calves
resembled
sticks
of
knotted
wood
the
manager
nearly
fell
over
in
his
chair
with
repressed
laughter
the
audience
was
one
vast
chuckle
well
sir
spoke
up
the
ringmaster
with
difficulty
keeping
a
straight
face
what
can
you
do
i
like
to
be
a
clown
grinned
the
victim
a
clown
sir
good
let
see
you
act
the
fellow
capered
into
the
ring
one
stocking
came
down
letting
out
a
quart
of
sawdust
one
tight
split
up
to
the
knee
as
he
made
a
jig
step
that
brought
the
tears
to
the
eyes
of
billy
blow
who
with
his
boy
had
come
to
witness
the
show
then
the
fellow
sang
a
funny
song
it
was
funny
his
voice
was
cracked
his
delivery
dolorous
he
began
to
shuffle
at
the
end
of
it
faster
faster
sir
cried
the
ringmaster
snapping
his
whip
across
the
bare
limb
exposed
faster
i
tell
you
ouch
yelled
the
aspirant
come
sir
faster
i
say
faster
faster
faster
purely
ring
practice
my
friend
we
do
this
to
all
the
clowns
you
know
with
the
pitiless
accuracy
of
a
bullwhacker
the
ringmaster
pursued
his
victim
the
landed
squarely
every
time
biting
like
a
hornet
the
aspirant
was
now
on
the
run
stop
do
help
he
roared
i
do
want
to
be
a
clown
and
with
a
bellow
he
ran
out
of
the
tent
followed
by
the
hooting
candy
peddlers
well
who
are
you
demanded
the
ringmaster
of
two
colored
boys
who
stepped
forward
double
trapeze
act
sir
said
one
of
them
oh
here
you
are
let
see
what
you
can
do
the
ringmaster
set
free
the
temporary
trapeze
rigging
these
aspirants
did
quite
well
singly
when
they
doubled
however
there
was
trouble
the
one
swinging
from
the
hands
of
the
other
lost
his
grip
he
caught
out
wildly
grabbed
at
the
shirt
sleeve
of
his
partner
to
save
himself
this
tightened
the
garment
at
the
neck
then
it
gave
way
buttons
and
all
both
tumbled
to
the
ground
they
began
upbraiding
one
another
came
to
blows
and
the
ringmaster
sent
them
about
their
business
saying
the
show
could
not
encourage
prize
fighters
the
programme
continued
there
was
an
ambitious
lad
who
was
quite
a
wonder
at
turning
rapid
cartwheels
another
did
some
creditable
pole
balancing
one
old
man
wanted
to
serve
as
a
magician
all
had
a
chance
but
their
merit
was
not
distinguished
enough
to
warrant
their
engagement
most
of
the
crowd
filed
out
when
the
last
of
the
amateurs
had
done
his
stunt
benares
then
stepped
up
to
the
ringmaster
and
beckoned
to
andy
at
his
direction
andy
threw
off
his
coat
and
hat
and
old
benares
led
the
horse
andy
had
noticed
into
the
main
tent
it
was
a
steed
the
ringmaster
got
it
started
around
the
ring
do
your
best
now
wildwood
whispered
marco
who
with
the
clown
and
the
manager
had
followed
into
the
main
tent
andy
was
on
his
mettle
he
made
a
run
took
a
leap
and
landed
on
the
platform
on
the
horse
back
just
as
he
had
done
a
hundred
times
back
at
fairview
very
good
nodded
the
ringmaster
as
andy
rode
around
the
ring
posing
several
times
try
the
spring
plank
next
suggested
the
manager
the
single
and
double
somersault
were
andy
specialty
the
apparatus
was
superb
he
was
not
quite
perfect
but
old
benares
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
after
several
efforts
with
the
words
fine
vary
fine
andy
did
some
creditable
twisting
on
the
trapeze
the
manager
and
the
ringmaster
conversing
together
meantime
report
to
me
in
the
morning
said
the
latter
to
andy
at
last
marco
followed
the
manager
as
he
left
the
tent
he
came
back
with
a
pleased
expression
of
face
it
all
right
lad
he
reported
you
in
the
ring
group
as
a
sub
he
tried
to
chisel
me
down
but
i
insisted
on
fair
pay
and
it
ten
dollars
a
week
for
you
andy
was
delighted
that
amount
seemed
a
small
fortune
to
him
no
danger
now
of
not
being
able
to
pay
back
to
graham
the
borrowed
five
dollars
and
his
other
fairview
debts
benares
took
him
in
hand
after
the
others
had
left
he
gave
him
a
great
many
training
suggestions
he
led
him
into
the
regular
practicing
tent
and
showed
him
the
mecanique
this
was
a
device
with
a
wooden
arm
from
which
hung
an
elastic
rope
harnessed
in
this
a
performer
could
attempt
all
kinds
of
contortions
without
scoring
a
fall
benares
also
showed
andy
how
to
make
effective
standing
somersaults
by
the
tuck
trick
this
was
to
grasp
both
legs
tightly
between
the
knees
and
ankles
pressing
them
close
together
at
the
same
time
the
acrobat
was
to
put
the
muscles
of
the
shoulders
and
back
in
full
play
the
combined
muscular
force
acted
like
a
of
a
wheel
and
enabled
that
neat
finished
somersault
which
always
brought
down
the
house
you
ought
to
try
the
slack
wire
too
when
you
get
a
chance
advised
benares
we
try
you
on
the
high
trapeze
in
the
triple
act
some
time
glad
you
in
the
profession
wildwood
and
we
all
give
you
a
lift
when
we
can
andy
felt
that
he
had
found
some
of
the
best
friends
in
the
world
and
was
a
acrobat
at
last
as
he
left
the
circus

a
new
jacket
and
a
neat
collar
and
necktie
his
face
had
no
trouble
in
it

the
appearance
of
a
person
eminently
satisfied
with

present
and
full
of
hope
and
animation

future

now
luke
led
andy
into
the
tent
where
the
side
show
was
a
big
frame
covered
with
cheese
cloth
took
up
the
entire
width
of
the
place
upon
this
a
man
with
a
brush
was
liberally
spreading
several
quarts
of
glaring
red
and
yellow
paint
greatest
curiosity
in
the
world
remarkable
freak
of
nature
the
famous
bolivar
trick
rooster
who
walks
backwards
so
much
of
the
grand
announcement
to
the
circus
public
had
been
already
painted
on
the
sign
they
bound
to
give
you
a
chance
anyhow
observed
andy
and
i
must
say
i
am
mighty
glad
of
it
and
see
here
continued
luke
animatedly
come
on
old
fellow
easy
now
ah
he
wants
a
lump
of
sugar
luke
had
approached
a
very
cage
its
occupant
was
one
of
the
largest
and
monkeys
andy
had
ever
seen
it
bristled
and
snarled
at
andy
but
as
luke
opened
the
cage
door
leaped
into
his
arms
snuggled
there
and
began
petting
his
face
with
one
paw
luke
gave
the
animal
a
lump
of
sugar
coaxed
it
stroked
it
then
he
took
it
over
to
where
an
impromptu
slack
wire
was
strung
between
two
posts
and
set
the
monkey
on
this
the
animal
went
through
some
evolutions
that
were
so
perfect
an
imitation
of
human
trapeze
performance
that
andy
was
fairly
astonished
the
people
here
give
me
great
credit
on
that
announced
luke
with
happy
eyes
as
he
put
the
monkey
back
in
his
cage
they
were
just
going
to
kill
him
when
i
came
here
kill
him
what
for
asked
andy
oh
he
was
so
savage
he
bit
off
an
attendant
finger
and
maimed
two
smaller
monkeys
he
would
do
anything
but
sulk
and
show
his
teeth
all
day
long
i
got
at
him
when
he
first
grabbed
my
hand
in
his
teeth
i
just
let
it
stay
there
never
tried
to
get
it
away
or
fight
him
just
looked
him
in
the
eyes
sort
of
reproachfully
and
began
to
oh
i
cried
artistic
i
did
say
that
monkey
just
stared
at
me
dropped
my
hand
and
began
to
bellow
at
the
top
of
his
voice
too
then
he
got
sorry
and
licked
my
hand
a
lump
of
sugar
sealed
the
compact
why
he
the
smartest
animal
in
the
show
you
see
what
he
did
for
me
the
people
here
are
delighted
it
made
me
solid
with
them
luke
introduced
andy
to
the
wild
man
a
most
individual
out
of
his
acting
disguise
his
wife
was
the
fat
woman
who
did
not
act
as
if
she
was
very
much
afraid
of
her
supposed
savage
and
untamable
husband
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
said
luke
presently
will
you
i
try
answered
andy
i
like
to
go
through
the
menagerie
you
see
i
not
regular
so
while
i
have
the
run
of
the
small
tops
they
wo
pass
me
in
at
the
big
flaps
andy
walked
over
with
his
new
acquaintance
to
the
menagerie
the
watchman
at
the
door
admitted
them
at
a
word
from
andy
the
trainers
keepers
and
manager
were
busy
about
the
place
feeding
the
animals
cleaning
the
cages
and
the
like
luke
eyes
sparkled
as
if
at
last
he
found
himself
in
his
element
he
petted
the
camels
affectionately
and
talked
to
the
elephants
in
a
purring
winning
tone
that
made
more
than
one
of
them
look
at
him
as
if
pleased
at
his
attention
the
lion
cages
were
luke
grand
centre
of
interest
he
stood
watching
old
sultan
the
king
of
the
menagerie
like
one
entranced
luke
began
talking
to
the
beast
in
a
musical
coaxing
tone
the
animal
sat
grim
as
a
statue
luke
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
as
he
withdrew
it
he
rested
his
fingers
on
the
edge
of
the
cage
the
lion
never
stirred
but
its
eyes
described
a
quick
rolling
movement
look
out
warned
andy
he
watching
you
i
want
him
to
answered
luke
coolly
but
luke
continued
his
animal
lullaby
he
kept
extending
his
hand
straight
up
towards
the
lion
face
he
raised
his
arm
fearlessly
now
inside
the
danger
line
fully
to
the
elbow
hi
back
thunder
he
eat
you
alive
yelled
a
trainer
discovering
the
lad
venturesome
position
good
old
fellow
so
so
old
sultan
bristled
then
his
corded
sinews
relaxed
he
lowered
his
muzzle
andy
stroked
it
gently
the
animal
sniffed
and
snuffed
at
his
hand
he
began
to
lick
it
just
then
the
trainer
ran
up
he
gave
luke
a
violent
jerk
backwards
throwing
him
prostrate
in
the
sawdust
with
a
frightful
roar
sultan
sprang
at
the
bars
of
the
cage
glaring
apparently
not
at
luke
but
at
the
trainer
do
you
want
to
lose
an
arm
shouted
the
latter
angrily
you
chump
that
animal
is
a
i
only
a
boy
though
you
see
said
luke
arising
and
brushing
the
sawdust
from
his
clothes
he
would
hurt
me
would
eh
why
he
did
all
the
same
did
he
now
say
mister
i
a
side
show
actor
just
now
but
some
day
i
work
up
to
the
cages
here
bet
you
i
can
make
friends
with
your
fiercest
member
bah
you
keep
away
from
those
cages
how
did
you
dare
to
do
that
asked
andy
as
the
boys
came
out
of
the
menagerie
why
i
tell
you
explained
luke
i
love
animals
and
most
times
they
seem
to
know
it
once
a
lion
tamer
summered
at
our
farm
on
account
of
poor
health
he
told
me
a
lot
of
things
about
his
business
one
thing
i
tried
just
now
i
got
a
lot
of
fine
sugar
flavored
with
anise
in
my
pocket
when
i
tackled
sultan
i
had
my
hand
covered
with
it
any
wild
animal
loves
the
smell
of
anise
you
saw
me
try
it
on
their
champion
and
it
worked
did
it
you
are
a
strange
kind
of
a
fellow
luke
said
andy
studying
his
companion
interestedly
that
so
smiled
luke
i
do
see
why
you
fancy
tumbling
i
dead
gone
on
the
cages
we
both
have
our
especial
ambitions
say
i
caught
your
name

to
use
your
full
name

the
circus
posters
or
just
andy

circus
posters

a
long
way
ahead
smiled
andy
but
if
i
ever
get
that
far
i
think
i
use
my
right
name
andy
wildwood
eh
what
that
andy
wildwood
exclaimed
luke
andy
was
amazed
at
a
sharp
start
and
shout
on
the
part
of
his
companion
why
what
now
he
began
andy
wildwood
andy
wildwood
repeated
luke
he
spoke
in
a
retrospective
subdued
tone
he
tapped
his
head
as
if
trying
to
awaken
some
sleeping
memory
got
it
now
he
cried
suddenly
why
sure
of
course
knew
the
name
in
a
minute
luke
seized
and
pulled
at
a
lock
of
his
hair
as
if
it
was
a
sprouting
idea
you
came
from
fairville
he
resumed
fairview
then
you
the
same
yes
you
must
be
the
fellow

the
enemy
the
young
acrobat
stared
hard
at
luke
belding
he
wondered
if
the
embryo
lion
tamer
was
crazy
or
had
he
not
heard
him
aright
instantly
andy
mind
ran
back
to
the
encounter
with
jim
tapp
on
the
streets
of
tipton
the
evening
previous
this
made
the
second
time
then
within
hours
that
an
allusion
had
been
made
to
the
fact
that
he
was
an
heir
andy
knew
of
no
reason
why
a
sudden
mystery
should
come
into
his
life
the
coincidence
of
the
double
reference
to
the
same
thing
however
namely
an
alleged
heirship
struck
him
as
peculiar
heir
he
spoke
in
a
bewildered
tone
me
an
heir
yes
said
luke
heir
to
what
why
oh
something
i
do
know
what
but
the
thing
you
heir
to
is
there
where
persisted
andy
i
do
know
that
either
fairview
i
reckon
nonsense
i
got
nothing
at
fairview
excepting
a
lot
of
debts
i
wish
you
explain
yourself
luke
there
ca
be
anything
to
your
absurd
statement
ca
there
cried
luke
excitedly
well
you
just
listen
and
see
oh
wildwood
been
looking
for
you
interrupted
some
one
just
there
andy
looked
up
to
recognize
marco
the
latter
nodded
to
luke
and
proceeded
to
lead
andy
away
with
him
hold
on
demurred
luke
you
have
to
excuse
your
friend
just
now
said
marco
very
important
wildwood
he
added
what
is
it
mr
marco
inquired
andy
marco
showed
two
folded
sheets
of
writing
paper
in
his
hand
your
contract
with
the
circus
he
explained
there
a
bad
hitch
in
this
business
hope
to
straighten
it
out
but
we
have
to
get
right
at
it
come
to
billy
blow
tent
i
want
to
have
a
private
talk
with
you
andy
traced
a
seriousness
in
marco
manner
that
oppressed
him
instantly
all
his
mind
was
fixed
on
the
matter
of
the
contracts
i
see
you
a
little
later
luke
he
said
to
his
young
friend
all
right
nodded
luke
i
got
a
good
deal
to
tell
you
but
it
will
keep
when
they
reached
the
clown
tent
marco
sat
down
on
the
bench
beside
andy
business
wildwood
he
spoke
briskly
tapping
the
papers
in
his
hand
i
wanted
to
get
you
fixed
right
and
started
right
in
to
get
a
contract
from
mr
scripps
is
that
it
asked
andy
yes
and
favorable
in
every
way
your
end
of
it
and
the
circus
end
is
all
right
but
there
another
end
that
is
it
i
reckon
you
better
get
the
gist
of
the
trouble
by
reading
it
over
marco
separated
one
of
the
written
sheets
and
passed
it
to
andy
oh
dear
cried
the
latter
in
dismay
the
moment
his
eyes
had
taken
in
the
general
subject
matter
of
the
screed
before
him
that
settles
it
andy
face
ran
quickly
from
consternation
to
utter
gloom
the
document
before
him
was
a
affair
awaiting
a
signature
it
stated
that
miss
lavinia
talcott
guardian
relative
of
andrew
wildwood
minor
hereby
agreed
to
hold
the
circus
management
free
from
any
blame
damage
or
indemnity
in
case
of
accident
to
the
said
andrew
wildwood
this
day
and
date
a
contracted
employee
of
said
circus
management
she
never
sign
it
cried
andy
positively
how
did
they
come
to
bring
her
name
into
this
business
anyhow
hold
hard
do
get
excited
wildwood
advised
marco
business
is
business
even
if
it
is
unpleasant
sometimes
you
got
the
facts
do
grumble
at
them
let
see
how
we
can
remedy
things
they
ca
be
remedied
declared
andy
forcibly
why
marco
i
would
meet
my
aunt
for
a
hundred
dollars
and
i
could
get
her
to
sign
any
such
a
paper
if
it
meant
a
thousand
dollars
to
me
marco
stroked
his
chin
thoughtfully
and
in
perplexity
then
the
jig
up
he
announced
definitely
you
see
wildwood
had
all
kinds
of
trouble
suits
judgments
injunctions
along
of
fellows
getting
hurt
in
the
show
one
man
lost
an
ear
in
the
act
he
recovered
two
thousand
dollars
damages
another
sprained
an
ankle
had
to
pay
him
eight
dollars
a
week
for
six
months
now
they
put
the
clause
in
the
contract
holding
the
circus
harmless
in
such
matters
where
it
a
minor
they
insist
further
that
parent
or
guardian
also
sign
off
all
claims
but
i
have
neither
said
andy
miss
lavinia
is
only
a
well
miss
starr
explained
just
how
matters
stood
to
scripps
he
has
got
time
to
quibble
over
your
aunt
her
signature
fixes
it
otherwise
you
left
out
in
the
cold
andy
was
never
so
dispirited
in
all
his
life
he
sat
dumb
and
wretched
like
a
person
suddenly
finding
his
house
collapsed
all
about
him
and
himself
in
the
midst
of
its
ruins
look
here
wildwood
said
marco
kindly
arising
after
a
reflective
pause
you
think
this
thing
over
you
a
pretty
smart
young
fellow
and
you
disappoint
me
a
good
deal
if
you
do
find
some
way
out
of
this
dilemma
andy
shook
his
head
doubtfully
he
sat
dejected
and
crestfallen
for
a
full
hour
then
he
left
the
circus
grounds
evading
friends
and
acquaintances
purposely
he
went
away
from
the
town
reached
meadows
and
woods
and
finally
threw
himself
down
under
a
great
sheltering
tree
andy
thought
hard
there
was
certainly
a
check
to
his
show
career
unless
he
secured
the
sanction
and
cooperation
of
his
aunt
judging
from
existing
circumstances
andy
utterly
despaired
of
moving
his
unlovable
relative
towards
any
action
that
would
favor
him
especially
was
this
true
after
he
had
defied
her
authority
and
run
away
from
home
if
harding
circus
wo
take
me
without
this
restriction
why
should
any
other
show
mused
andy
oh
dear
just
as
things
looked
so
bright
and
hopeful
to
have
this
happen
the
boy
gulped
trying
hard
to
keep
back
the
tears
of
vexation
and
disappointment
then
he
became
indignant
he
got
actually
mad
as
he
decided
that
he
was
a
victim
of
rank
injustice
he
arose
under
the
spur
of
violent
varied
emotions
pacing
the
spot
excitedly
wrestling
with
the
problem
that
threatened
to
destroy
all
his
fond
youthful
ambitions
gradually
his
mind
cleared
gradually
too
a
better
balance
came
to
his
thoughts
he
went
logically
and
seriously
over
the
situation
daylight
was
just
going
as
andy
arrived
at
a
heroic
decision
there
only
one
way
he
said
slowly
and
firmly
it
looks
hopeless
but
i
going
to
try
yes
make
or
break
i
going
to
face
aunt
lavinia
boldly
andy
wildwood
started
in
the
direction
of
tipton
chapter
xxiv
andy
aunt
andy
went
straight
to
an
old
dwelling
house
in
a
retired
part
of
the
town
he
had
been
there
twice
before
when
younger
and
remembered
that
an
old
couple
named
norman
lived
there
the
normans
were
distant
relatives
of
his
aunt
lavinia
she
had
other
acquaintances
in
tipton
but
andy
recalled
usually
made
the
norman
home
her
headquarters
paying
them
some
small
sum
for
board
and
lodging
whenever
she
visited
them
the
old
ramshackly
house
stood
far
back
from
the
street
its
front
fence
was
broken
down
and
andy
crossed
the
lot
from
the
side
there
was
no
light
downstairs
except
in
the
kitchen
at
the
rear
an
upstairs
middle
room
however
seemed
occupied
for
chinks
of
light
came
through
the
outside
shutters
the
slats
of
these
were
turned
upwards
to
catch
light
in
the
daytime
and
shut
out
a
view
from
street
and
garden
just
beneath
this
window
was
a
door
and
steps
the
latter
had
nearly
rotted
away
and
the
door
was
nailed
up
and
out
of
use
a
framework
formed
of
hoop
poles
rose
up
from
the
steps
once
green
vines
had
enclosed
these
at
present
however
only
a
few
dead
strands
clung
to
the
original
framework
the
top
of
this
framework
was
not
three
feet
under
the
window
sill
of
the
lighted
room
across
it
lay
some
fishing
poles
and
nets
also
some
old
garden
tools
it
apparently
being
used
as
a
for
useless
truck
about
the
place
for
a
long
time
past
i
assume
that
aunt
is
in
that
room
thought
andy
halting
near
the
framework
and
looking
up
at
the
window
she
always
has
the
middle
room
here
yes
she
is
there
and
a
man
with
her
maybe
better
skirmish
around
a
little
instead
of
running
the
risk
of
being
nabbed
before
i
can
have
an
explanation
i
want
a
little
private
talk
with
aunt
alone
if
i
can
get
it
andy
bent
his
ear
he
caught
no
words
only
the
sound
of
human
voices
his
aunt
high
strained
tones
were
unmistakable
he
seized
one
of
the
supporting
poles
of
the
framework
it
rattled
and
quivered
yet
he
believed
it
would
hold
him
if
he
proceeded
carefully
it
was
no
trick
at
all
for
andy
to
make
a
quiet
and
rapid
ascent
he
perched
across
the
top
of
the
framework
and
raised
his
head
andy
saw
his
aunt
closing
up
a
packed
satchel
on
a
chair
she
had
her
bonnet
on
as
if
just
going
out
at
the
hallway
door
was
a
man
taking
his
leave
he
was
excessively
polite
hat
in
hand
and
making
a
most
respectful
bow
well
commented
andy
fairly
aghast
andy
recognized
the
man
instantly
he
was
the
individual
he
had
seen
in
the
hay
barn
he
was
daley
companion
the
man
who
had
doctored
the
benares
brothers
trapeze
in
the
circus
at
centreville
in
a
flash
andy
fancied
he
understood
the
situation
the
motive
of
this
fellow
presence
here
and
now
jim
tapp
found
out
my
aunt
theorized
andy
rapidly
he
this
fellow
and
the
mail
thieves
are
all
in
a
crowd
murdock
here
has
probably
come
to
tell
my
aunt
that
he
knows
where
i
am
she
may
have
made
a
bargain
to
pay
him
well
if
he
will
kidnap
me
or
in
any
way
get
me
back
to
fairview
it
a
fine
fix
to
be
in
concluded
andy
bitterly
he
was
for
getting
back
to
the
ground
going
to
the
circus
turning
in
the
contract
giving
up
all
hopes
of
show
life
and
getting
to
a
safe
distance
before
his
enemies
could
capture
him
no
i
wo
resolved
andy
a
second
later
acting
on
a
new
impulse
at
least
not
right
away
i
turn
one
trick
on
my
enemies
first
the
circus
detectives
want
this
scoundrel
murdock
bad
i
get
down
follow
him
and
have
him
arrested
the
first
policeman
we
meet
andy
bent
on
a
descent
paused
murdock
was
speaking
are
you
going
back
home
to
fairview
miss
talcott
he
asked
yes
snapped
andy
aunt
in
her
usual
quick
sharp
way
then
i
will
call
on
you
at
fairview
if
you
want
to
was
the
ungracious
answer
no
no
softly
declared
the
oily
rogue
if
you
want
me
to
madam
this
is
your
business
miss
talcott
oh
observed
andy
aunt
snappily
you
working
for
nothing
i
suppose
i
not
frankly
answered
murdock
i
working
for
a
fee
what
i
get
though
is
so
small
compared
with
what
you
may
get
very
well
interrupted
miss
lavinia
when
you
have
this
matter
in
a
clear
definite
shape
i
shall
be
ready
to
listen
to
you
good
evening
then
madam
evening
retorted
andy
aunt
with
a
curt
nod
going
on
with
her
packing
andy
rested
his
hand
against
the
house
to
get
a
purchase
and
leap
to
the
ground
pshaw
he
exclaimed
abruptly
one
of
the
hoop
poles
bent
nearly
in
two
throwing
him
off
his
balance
andy
caught
at
the
window
sill
and
his
body
slipped
to
one
side
he
tried
to
drop
found
himself
impeded
and
held
himself
steady
looking
down
his
rustling
about
had
made
something
of
a
racket
as
he
was
seeking
to
determine
what
had
caught
and
held
the
side
of
his
coat
one
of
the
wooden
shutters
was
thrust
violently
open
its
edge
struck
his
head
he
dodged
aside
then
he
sat
staring
the
full
light
from
within
the
room
showing
him
to
its
occupant
as
plain
as
day
um
commented
miss
lavinia
simply
some
one
was
there
and
you
andy
wildwood
andy
was
taken
aback
his
aunt
was
not
particularly
startled
she
rather
looked
stern
and
suspicious
she
did
not
grab
him
or
call
for
help
or
seem
to
care
whether
he
came
in
or
stayed
out
yes
it
me
aunt
said
andy
a
good
deal
crestfallen
and
embarrassed
you
see
i
wanted
to
see
you
then
why
did
you
come
like
a
civilized
being
the
house
has
doors
tell
me
do
you
intend
to
come
in
if
you
please
aunt
you
may
do
so
thank
you
fluttered
andy
he
now
discovered
that
his
coat
had
caught
in
fish
hooks
attached
to
an
eel
line
all
tangled
up
in
the
framework
it
took
him
fully
two
minutes
to
get
free
andy
climbed
over
the
window
sill
and
stood
fumbling
his
cap
his
old
awe
of
his
dictatorial
relative
was
as
strong
as
ever
within
him
ca
you
sit
down
she
demanded
sinking
to
a
chair
herself
and
facing
him
steadily
how
long
have
you
been
outside
there
only
a
few
minutes
answered
andy
did
you
see
anybody
in
this
room
beside
myself
yes
a
man
and
eavesdropping
i
suppose
insinuated
miss
lavinia
i
heard
him
say
night
um
commented
miss
lavinia
that
closed
the
subject
for
the
present
she
had
always
known
andy
to
be
a
truthful
boy
and
his
reply
seemed
to
satisfy
her
and
relieve
her
mind
andy
wondered
what
he
had
better
say
first
the
fixed
set
stare
of
his
stern
uncompromising
relative
made
him
nervous
see
here
aunt
he
blurted
out
at
last
i
never
seemed
to
do
anything
right
i
did
for
you
and
you
do
care
a
snap
for
me
i
see
why
you
keep
hounding
me
down
and
wanting
me
back
home
i
do
eh
ejaculated
andy
no
i
do
declared
miss
lavinia
you
do
want
me
back
at
fairview
i
said
so
did
i
snapped
miss
lavinia
then
then
see
here
andy
wildwood
interrupted
his
aunt
in
a
tone
of
severity
you
have
been
a
disobedient
ungrateful
boy
you
deserve
to
be
locked
up
i
tried
to
have
you
i
am
so
satisfied
however
on
reflection
that
you
will
have
a
bad
ending
anyhow
that
i
have
decided
to
wash
my
hands
of
you
glory
uttered
andy
to
himself
in
a
vast
thrill
of
delight
have
you
joined
the
circus
continued
miss
lavinia
they
wo
have
me
why
not
without
your
sanction
they
want
you
to
sign
away
any
claims
as
to
damages
if
i
get
hurt
i
knew
you
would
do
that
you
are
mistaken
andy
wildwood
i
will
do
it
it
too
easy
to
be
true
breathed
andy
in
wild
amazement
you
you
will
sign
such
a
paper
he
stammered
did
i
say
so
let
me
understand
you
wish
to
cut
loose
from
home
and
friends
for
good
do
you
you
do
want
to
ever
return
to
fairview
not
till
i
rich
and
famous
answered
andy
h
very
well
what
have
i
got
to
sign
that
it
said
andy
with
eager
hand
drawing
a
written
sheet
from
his
pocket
miss
lavinia
opened
the
document
read
it
through
went
to
the
table
took
a
fountain
pen
from
her
reticule
signed
the
paper
returned
it
to
andy
i
dreaming
it
a
plot
of
some
kind
murmured
andy
lost
in
wonderment
miss
lavinia
took
out
her
andy
wildwood
she
said
her
harsh
features
as
as
ever
here
are
ten
dollars
it
is
the
last
cent
i
will
ever
give
you
when
you
leave
here
you
sever
all
ties
between
us
i
have
only
one
stipulation
to
make
you
will
not
disgrace
me
by
having
anything
to
do
with
anybody
in
fairview
that
all
right
said
andy
i
agree
except
that
i
got
to
write
to
graham
on
business
what
business
andy
explained
in
full
if
he
had
been
more
versed
in
the
wiles
of
the
world
less
astonished
at
his
aunt
strange
compliance
with
his
dearest
wishes
he
would
have
noticed
a
keen
suspiciousness
in
the
glance
with
which
she
continually
regarded
him
i
must
insist
that
you
do
not
write
even
to
graham
she
remarked
about

a
bewildered
tone

andy
did
this
and
now
good
night
and
spoke
his
aunt
i
hope
you
some
day
see
the
error
of
your
ways
andy
wildwood
miss
lavinia
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
with
andy
she
nodded
towards
the
door
to
dismiss
him
as
she
would
have
done
to
a
perfect
stranger
aunt
lavinia
said
andy
you
thinking
a
little
hard
of
me
but
you
done
a
big
thing
in
signing
that
paper
and
i
never
do
anything
to
make
you
ashamed
of
me
ginger
am
i
afoot
or
horseback
permission
to
join
the
show
ten
dollars
oh
my
head
is
just
whirling
these
last
sentences
andy
tittered
in
a
vivid
gasp
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
and
once
more
reached
the
outer
air
he
hurried
from
the
vicinity
fearful
that
his
aunt
might
change
her
mind
and
call
him
back
i
do
understand
it
he
mused
i
ca
figure
it
out
that
paper
fixes
it
so
she
ca
stop
me
joining
the
show
nor
force
me
back
to
fairview
then
what
is
she
having
dealings
with
murdock
for
andy
could
not
solve
this
puzzle
and
did
not
try
to
do
so
any
further
within
an
hour
the
two
precious
documents
were
signed
sealed
and
delivered
and
andy
wildwood
entered
on
his
career
as
a
salaried
circus
acrobat
chapter
xxv
a
bear
on
the
rampage
all
to
the
blare
of
quick
music
the
great
tent
ablaze
with
light
the
rows
of
benches
with
excited
humanity
andy
wildwood
left
the
for
a
second
he
whirled
in
midair
then
gracefully
landing
on
the
padded
carpet
he
made
his
bow
amid
pleased
plaudits
and
rejoined
the
row
of
fellow
tumblers
you
caught
the
knack
spoke
the
ringmaster
encouragingly
be
careful
on
the
double
somersault
though
it
just
as
easy
to
me
asserted
andy
he
proved
his
words
when
his
turn
came
again
he
was
breathless
but
all
aglow
as
he
and
his
seven
fellow
acrobats
bowed
in
a
row
and
retired
to
the
performers
tent
andy
was
delighted
with
himself
his
comrades
his
environment
everything
in
fact
a
constant
glamour
of
excitement
and
enjoyment
had
come
into
his
life
this
was
the
second
day
after
his
strange
interview
with
his
aunt
it
was
the
last
evening
performance
of
the
show
at
tipton
andy
had
been
away
from
the
circus
for
two
days
the
morning
after
handing
in
the
contracts
the
manager
had
selected
him
to
accompany
the
chief
hostler
and
four
of
his
assistants
on
a
trip
into
the
country
the
show
was
to
make
a
long
jump
after
closing
the
engagement
at
tipton
while
harding
joined
a
second
enterprise
he
owned
in
the
west
the
present
outfit
was
to
take
up
a
route
in
the
south
many
of
those
connected
with
the
show
were
to
leave
this
cut
the
working
force
down
they
had
too
many
horses
and
with
a
string
of
fifty
of
these
the
chief
hostler
started
out
to
sell
off
the
same
the
expedition
continued
a
day
and
a
half
when
andy
came
back
he
found
himself
in
time
for
two
rehearsals
that
evening
he
made
his
first
appearance
in
public
as
a
real
professional
outside
of
the
charm
of
being
seen
appreciated
and
applauded
by
others
andy
loved
the
vigorous
exercise
of
the
the
mechanical
athletic
and
acrobatic
equipments
of
the
show
were
superb
he
made
up
his
mind
he
could
about
live
among
the
balancing
bars
and
trapezes
if
they
would
let
him
one
disappointment
andy
met
with
that
somewhat
troubled
him
when
he
came
back
from
the
expedition
he
found
that
luke
belding
had
left
the
show
billy
blow
told
andy
that
luke
had
been
to
his
tent
a
dozen
times
to
see
him
that
morning
early
before
andy
return
the
side
show
luke
was
with
had
packed
up
and
shipped
by
train
to
join
a
show
going
east
so
i
never
find
out
what
i
heir
to
smiled
andy
oh
well
of
course
it
was
some
absurd
guess
of
luke
it
funny
though
that
fellow
jim
tapp
had
the
same
delusion
by
the
way
aunt
lavinia
seems
to
have
been
in
earnest
nobody
appears
to
be
looking
for
me
to
go
back
to
fairview
i
am
free
to
do
as
i
choose
now
then
to
make
a
record
sunday
was
passed
at
tipton
of
the
better
class
in
the
show
nearly
all
the
lady
performers
and
some
of
the
men
went
to
church
and
andy
went
also
in
the
afternoon
billy
blow
went
the
rounds
of
some
friends
and
took
andy
with
him
it
revealed
a
new
phase
of
circus
life
the
domestic
side
to
andy
there
was
no
shop
talk
the
boy
passed
a
pleasant
hour
among
several
very
charming
family
circles
next
day
everybody
pitched
into
genuine
hard
work
the
circus
train
had
been
sent
for
and
occupied
a
long
railroad
siding
andy
was
amazed
at
the
system
and
order
of
the
proposed
transit
the
train
was
on
a
big
scale
the
manager
had
a
car
to
himself
the
star
performers
were
cared
for
in
luxurious
parlor
coaches
even
the
minor
employees
were
and
feeding
arrangements
for
man
and
beast
were
perfect
in
order
to
reach
their
destination
which
was
montgomery
a
central
southern
city
the
train
made
many
shifts
from
one
railway
line
to
another
this
took
time
and
necessitated
many
unpleasant
stoppages
and
waits
it
was
the
second
day
of
the
trip
when
they
were
at
a
little
way
station
here
it
was
given
out
they
would
remain
from
noon
until
midnight
awaiting
a
fruit
express
which
would
pick
them
up
and
deliver
them
at
terminus
billy
blow
his
boy
midget
and
andy
had
a
compartment
in
a
car
when
the
long
stop
was
announced
andy
was
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
stretch
his
limbs
he
interested
himself
for
more
than
an
hour
watching
the
menagerie
men
attend
to
the
animals
they
were
fed
and
watered
their
quarters
neatly
renovated
while
a
veterinarian
went
from
cage
to
cage
examining
them
professionally
and
treating
those
that
were
sick
or
ailing
big
bob
the
star
bear
of
the
show
had
in
some
way
run
a
great
sliver
into
one
paw
this
had
festered
the
flesh
and
bruin
bound
with
stout
ropes
had
been
brought
out
of
his
cage
on
a
wheeled
litter
and
laid
on
the
grass
for
careful
treatment
andy
watched
the
skilful
doctoring
of
the
big
bellowing
fellow
with
curiosity
then
he
strolled
off
into
a
stretch
of
timber
to
enjoy
a
brief
walk
he
reached
a
deliciously
cool
and
shady
nook
and
threw
himself
down
at
the
mossy
trunk
of
a
tree
to
rest
in
the
midst
of
fresh
air
peaceful
solitude
and
merrily
singing
birds
andy
was
lost
in
a
soothing
day
dream
when
a
great
rustle
made
him
sit
up
startled
a
dark
object
passed
close
by
him
in
and
out
among
the
bushes
it
was
of
great
size
and
was
making
its
way
fast
and
furiously
i
declare
cried
andy
springing
to
his
feet
if
it
is
the
bear
now
how
in
the
world
did
he
get
loose
andy
stood
for
a
moment
staring
in
wonder
after
the
disappearing
animal
it
was
certainly
big
bob
the
animal
was
fully
familiar
to
andy
the
beast
wobbled
to
one
side
as
it
ran
and
this
the
boy
discerned
was
due
to
the
sore
paw
he
was
a
fugitive
and
his
escape
had
been
discovered
andy
could
surmise
this
from
shouts
and
calls
in
the
distance
back
in
the
direction
of
the
circus
train
big
bob
had
a
bad
reputation
with
the
menagerie
men
at
times
placid
and
even
on
other
occasions
he
was
capricious
savage
and
dangerous
even
his
trainer
had
narrowly
escaped
a
death
blow
from
one
of
the
animal
enormous
paws
when
the
brute
was
in
one
of
its
tantrums
the
bear
was
lumbering
along
as
if
bent
on
getting
a
good
start
against
pursuit
he
chose
a
sheltered
route
as
if
instinctively
cunning
andy
acting
on
a
quick
impulse
started
after
the
bear
the
route
led
up
a
hill
big
bob
scaled
a
moderately
steep
incline
and
disappeared
over
its
crest
andy
reaching
this
glanced
backwards
from
that
height
he
could
look
well
over
the
country
the
belated
train
was
in
sight
from
it
armed
with
pikes
and
ropes
a
dozen
or
more
menagerie
men
were
running
the
alarm
had
spread
to
the
settlement
of
houses
near
by
andy
saw
several
men
armed
with
shotguns
and
rifles
scouring
adjacent
wood
stretches
i
wo
dare
to
tackle
the
bear
but
i
try
and
run
him
down
till
he
gets
tired
thought
andy
he
remembered
many
a
discussion
of
the
menagerie
men
over
the
real
danger
and
loss
involved
in
the
escape
of
an
animal
the
fugitive
rarely
did
much
damage
except
to
hen
roosts
beyond
scaring
human
beings
the
trouble
was
that
armed
farmers
pursuing
thought
it
great
sport
to
bring
down
the
fugitive
with
a
shot
big
bob
was
worth
a
good
deal
of
money
to
the
show
the
principal
aim
of
the
menagerie
men
therefore
was
to
prevent
the
slaughter
of
an
escaped
animal
down
the
hill
bruin
ran
and
andy
after
him
then
there
was
a
country
road
and
big
bob
put
down
this
andy
could
easily
outrun
the
fugitive
but
this
was
not
his
policy
for
the
present
the
disabled
foot
of
the
animal
diminished
his
normal
speed
andy
believed
that
bruin
would
soon
find
and
harbor
himself
in
some
cozy
nook
at
a
turn
in
the
road
andy
noticed
that
there
was
a
house
a
few
hundred
feet
ahead
beyond
this
several
other
dwellings
were
scattered
about
the
landscape
i
do
like
that
mused
andy
it
may
mean
trouble
i
rather
see
the
old
scamp
take
to
the
open
country
wonder
if
i
can
head
him
off
andy
leaped
a
field
fence
he
doubled
his
pace
got
even
with
big
bob
then
ahead
of
him
he
snatched
up
a
pitchfork
lying
across
a
heap
of
hay
and
bolted
over
the
fence
to
the
road
again
extending
the
implement
he
stood
ready
to
challenge
the
approaching
fugitive
and
if
possible
turn
bruin
course
big
bob
did
not
appear
to
notice
andy
until
about
fifty
feet
distant
from
him
then
the
animal
lifted
his
shaggy
head
his
eyes
glared
his
collar
bristled
with
a
deep
menacing
roar
the
bear
increased
his
speed
he
headed
defiantly
for
the
pronged
barrier
which
andy
extended
big
bob
ran
squarely
upon
the
pitchfork
its
prongs
grazed
the
animal
breast
andy
experienced
a
shock
he
was
forced
back
thrown
flat
and
the
next
minute
picked
himself
up
from
the
shallow
ditch
at
the
side
of
the
road
into
which
he
had
fallen
well
commented
andy
staring
down
the
road
he
a
good
one
big
bob
had
never
stopped
he
was
putting
ahead
for
dear
life
andy
watched
him
near
the
farm
house
the
animal
turned
in
at
a
road
gateway
he
ran
rapidly
up
to
an
open
window
at
the
side
of
the
house
its
sill
held
something
andy
could
not
precisely
make
out
what
at
the
distance
he
was
from
the
spot
he
fancied
however
that
it
was
dishes
holding
pies
or
some
other
food
put
out
to
cool
big
bob
arose
erect
on
his
hind
legs
his
fore
feet
rested
on
the
window
sill
his
great
muzzle
dipped
into
whatever
it
held
at
that
moment
from
inside
the
farmhouse
there
rang
out
the
most
curdling
yell
andy
wildwood
had
ever
heard
chapter
xxvi
a
clever
ruse
the
boy
acrobat
scrambled
up
from
the
roadside
ditch
seized
the
pitchfork
and
dashed
along
in
the
direction
big
bob
had
taken
a
glance
showed
the
audacious
animal
still
at
the
window
of
the
farmhouse
though
now
under
it
bruin
had
swept
the
contents
of
the
window
sill
to
the
ground
with
one
movement
of
his
great
paw
he
was
now
discussing
the
merits
of
the
dishes
he
had
dislodged
with
a
crash
andy
ran
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
from
within
occasional
hysterical
shrieks
issued
they
were
mingled
with
distracted
sobs
at
another
open
window
andy
halted
he
could
look
into
a
middle
apartment
crossing
the
entire
house
crouching
in
a
corner
was
a
young
woman
her
eyes
were
fixed
in
terror
on
the
window
at
which
the
bear
had
appeared
in
her
arms
was
a
child
crying
in
affright
an
older
woman
stood
at
a
telephone
twisting
its
call
bell
handle
frantically
do
be
afraid
said
andy
it
a
harmless
old
bear
escaped
from
the
circus
down
at
the
tracks
the
two
women
regarded
him
mutely
too
scared
to
believe
him
andy
heard
the
telephone
bell
ring
quick
quick
cried
the
woman
at
the
instrument
send
help
a
big
bear
we
be
devoured
alive
no
you
wo
declared
andy
in
a
shout
making
around
the
house
he
hardly
knew
what
to
do
next
but
he
kept
his
eyes
open
he
hoped
for
some
discovery
among
the
truck
littering
the
yard
that
would
suggest
a
way
of
getting
big
bob
again
on
the
run
capital
the
very
thing
cried
andy
suddenly
he
dropped
the
pitchfork
and
whipped
out
his
pocket
knife
in
two
seconds
he
had
severed
a
stretch
of
clothes
line
running
from
a
hook
on
the
house
to
a
post
then
andy
ran
to
the
kitchen
door
hanging
at
its
side
was
a
big
piece
of
raw
beef
it
was
evidently
from
an
animal
recently
slaughtered
for
it
was
still
moist
and
dripping
andy
tightly
secured
one
end
of
the
clothes
line
about
it
he
ran
to
the
side
of
the
house
big
bob
was
just
finishing
a
repast
on
some
apple
pie
andy
gave
the
meat
a
fling
it
struck
the
bear
in
the
face
big
bob
raised
his
head
he
sniffed
and
licked
his
lips
he
made
an
eager
hungry
spring
for
the
meat
which
had
rebounded
several
feet
come
on
said
andy
sure
now
that
his
bait
was
a
good
one
and
that
his
experiment
would
succeed
i
got
you
i
guess
andy
started
on
a
run
paying
out
the
rope
just
as
big
bob
was
about
to
pounce
upon
the
toothsome
spoil
andy
gave
it
a
jerk
he
gauged
his
rate
of
progress
on
a
close
estimate
along
the
trail
sped
bruin
andy
put
across
the
fields
he
heard
a
bell
ring
out
glancing
back
at
the
farmhouse
he
saw
a
human
arm
reaching
through
an
open
window
it
pulled
at
a
rope
leading
to
a
big
alarm
bell
hanging
from
the
eaves
looking
beyond
the
farmhouse
he
also
saw
three
or
four
men
in
a
distant
field
summoned
by
the
bell
now
rushing
in
its
direction
i
get
big
bob
beyond
the
danger
line
anyhow
decided
andy
no
you
do
the
fugitive
had
pounced
fairly
on
the
dragging
beef
andy
gave
it
a
whirling
jerk
bruin
uttered
a
baffled
growl
come
on
laughed
andy
this
is
jolly
fun
if
it
does
end
in
a
tragedy
andy
ran
under
the
bottom
rail
of
a
fence
he
made
time
and
distance
for
the
bear
did
not
squeeze
through
so
readily
andy
put
through
a
brushy
reach
beyond
big
bob
began
to
lag
he
limped
and
panted
if
i
can
only
tucker
him
out
thought
andy
he
kept
up
the
race
for
fully
as
he
reached
the
edge
of
a
boggy
stretch
andy
saw
directly
beyond
the
top
of
a
house
poking
up
among
a
grove
of
fir
trees
andy
eyes
were
everywhere
as
he
neared
the
building
its
lower
part
was
so
tightly
shuttered
and
closed
up
that
he
decided
at
once
it
was
an
empty
house
getting
nearer
however
he
discovered
that
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
stone
cellar
steps
was
open
andy
glanced
back
of
him
big
bob
with
lolling
tongue
was
lumbering
steadily
on
his
track
perhaps
twenty
feet
to
the
rear
i
try
it
determined
andy
he
ran
down
the
steps
halted
in
the
dark
cellar
pulled
in
the
meat
and
flung
it
ahead
of
him
then
stepping
to
one
side
he
prepared
to
act
promptly
when
the
right
moment
arrived
big
bob
came
to
the
steps
cleared
them
in
a
spring
and
ran
past
andy
the
latter
dodged
outside
in
a
flash
he
banged
the
door
shut
shot
its
bolt
sank
to
the
steps
and
swept
his
hand
over
his
dripping
brow
whew
panted
andy
but
i
made
it
andy
felt
that
he
had
done
a
pretty
clever
thing
he
had
gotten
the
fugitive
safely
caged
behind
a
stout
locked
door
the
cellar
had
several
windows
but
they
were
high
up
and
too
small
for
big
bob
to
ever
squeeze
through
i
do
believe
there
is
anybody
at
home
said
andy
getting
up
to
investigate
i
going
to
find
out
gracious
i
have
there
is
andy
was
terribly
startled
almost
appalled
at
just
that
moment
a
frightful
yell
rang
out
it
proceeded
from
the
cellar
into
which
he
had
locked
the
bear
a
sharp
crash
followed
andy
staring
spellbound
saw
one
of
the
side
windows
of
the
cellar
dashed
out
through
the
aperture
immediately
following
there
clambered
a
man
he
was
hatless
a
big
red
streak
crossed
his
cheek
his
coat
was
in
ribbons
down
the
back
white
as
a
sheet
chattering
and
trembling
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
gave
one
affrighted
glance
back
of
him
and
shot
for
the
road
like
a
meteor
bang
bang
bang
oh
dear
cried
the
distressed
andy
what
up
now
chapter
xxvii
a
royal
reward
bang
bang
five
sharp
reports
rang
out
from
the
cellar
then
came
a
roar
from
big
bob
then
a
second
frantic
man
appeared
at
the
smashed
window
one
sleeve
was
in
ribbons
he
carried
a
smoking
pistol
without
ado
like
his
predecessor
he
ran
for
the
road
glancing
thither
andy
saw
the
two
running
down
it
one
after
the
other
like
mad
andy
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
it
all
the
two
men
did
not
look
like
farmers
he
went
around
the
house
and
hammered
at
the
front
door
no
response
every
window
on
the
lower
floor
was
tightly
shuttered
finally
he
came
back
to
the
smashed
window
at
first
he
could
see
nothing
much
beyond
it
then
his
eyes
becoming
accustomed
to
the
darkness
he
was
able
to
make
out
the
cellar
interior
quite
clearly
his
anxiety
as
to
big
bob
was
immediately
relieved
if
five
bullets
had
been
fired
at
the
bear
they
had
made
no
more
impression
than
peas
from
a
putty
blower
the
serene
old
animal
was
leisurely
devouring
the
juicy
bait
that
had
lured
him
to
his
present
prison
he
safe
for
a
time
anyhow
decided
andy
i
ca
quite
make
out
the
situation
here
it
looks
to
me
as
if
those
two
men
do
exactly
fit
to
the
premises
they
are
certainly
not
farmers
nor
tramps
maybe
they
had
sneaked
in
the
cellar
for
a
nap
or
to
steal
leaving
the
door
open
and
big
bob
tackled
them
andy
made
further
unsuccessful
efforts
to
arouse
the
house
he
was
sure
now
that
there
was
nobody
at
home
he
sat
down
on
its
front
steps
to
think
finally
he
noticed
that
a
wire
ran
from
the
barb
wire
fence
in
front
into
the
house
they
got
a
telephone
here
as
they
have
at
most
of
these
farmhouses
he
decided
that
ought
to
help
me
out
if
i
could
only
get
to
the
inside
andy
took
another
rambling
tour
about
the
house
finally
he
discovered
a
window
an
inch
or
two
down
from
the
top
in
the
second
story
his
natural
aptitude
for
climbing
helped
him
out
with
the
aid
of
a
lightning
rod
he
soon
reached
the
window
lowered
it
further
stepped
into
a
bedroom
and
descended
a
pair
of
stairs
looking
around
the
little
front
hall
he
made
out
a
telephone
instrument
on
the
outside
wall
andy
promptly
turned
the
handle
of
the
call
bell
he
placed
the
receiver
to
his
ear
hello
came
the
instantaneous
response
this
is
central
central
where
asked
andy
brownville
are

anywhere
near
the
way
station
where
the
circus
train
is
sidetracked
inquired
andy
certainly
we
the
station
town
can
you
reach
any
of
the
circus
folks
reach
them
responded
the
distant
telephone
operator
animatedly
the
woods
are
full
of
them
they
say
the
whole
menagerie
has
escaped
and
they
hunting
for
the
animals
everywhere
what
do
you
want
i
want
to
talk
with
some
one
connected
with
the
show
and
quick
all
right
i
just
got
to
call
to
the
street
wait
a
minute
soon
a
new
voice
came
over
the
telephone
hello
who
is
that
asked
andy
promptly
brophy
oh
the
chief
hostler
say
brophy
this
is
andy
wildwood
the
acrobat
where
are
you
tumbler
yes
listen
i
found
and
caged
big
bob
what
that
say
where
even
over
the
wire
andy
could
discern
that
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
was
manifestly
stirred
up
let
me
tell
you
spoke
andy
i
got
the
animal
shut
up
in
a
cellar
for
how
long
or
how
safe
i
ca
tell
you
had
better
tell
the
trainer
and
get
some
people
here
with
the
things
to
secure
the
bear
i
do
it
called
back
brophy
try
and
keep
those
crazy
farmers
from
finding
him
there
a
hundred
of
them
out
gunning
all
right
listen
andy
described
his
present
location
he
wound
up
by
saying
he
would
stay
within
call
telephone
until
the
capturing
crew
put
in
an
appearance
andy
sat
down
in
an
easy
chair
in
the
hall
a
good
deal
satisfied
with
himself
however
he
felt
a
trifle
squeamish
at
the
thought
of
the
tenant
of
the
premises
returning
and
finding
him
there
a
growling
grunt
came
to
his
ears
andy
tracing
it
came
to
an
open
doorway
leading
down
under
the
front
stairs
to
the
cellar
this
he
closed
and
locked
although
he
saw
that
the
stairs
were
too
crooked
and
narrow
to
admit
of
big
bob
ascending
to
the
upper
portion
of
the
house
andy
simply
rested
there
was
no
further
call
on
the
telephone
finally
he
arose
abruptly
to
his
feet
the
sound
of
wagon
wheels
came
from
the
front
of
the
house
a
minute
later
footsteps
echoed
on
the
steps
a
key
grated
in
the
front
door
lock
the
door
swung
open
hi
hello
who
are
you
sang
out
a
brusque
challenging
voice
the
minute
the
newcomer
entered
the
hall
his
eyes
fell
on
andy
they
became
filled
with
dark
suspicion
he
was
a
man
andy
believed
he
was
the
proprietor
of
the
premises
although
he
did
not
resemble
a
farmer
this
man
kicked
the
door
shut
behind
him
he
made
a
pounce
on
andy
and
grabbed
his
arm
let
me
explain
began
andy
how
did
you
get
in
here
retorted
the
man
his
brow
darkening
by
an
open
window
i
was
waiting
let
have
a
closer
look
at
you
interrupted
the
newcomer
dragging
andy
with
him
the
speaker
threw
open
the
parlor
door
that
room
was
lighter
but
as
he
crossed
its
threshold
he
uttered
a
wild
shout
he
stood
spellbound
staring
about
the
apartment
andy
stared
too
the
room
was
in
dire
disorder
a
cabinet
had
all
its
drawers
out
the
floor
was
littered
with
their
former
contents
a
stout
tin
box
was
overturned
its
fastenings
were
all
wrenched
apart
robbed
gasped
the
man
ha
i
see
you
are
a
burglar
he
continued
turning
fiercely
on
the
astonished
youth
not
me
dissented
andy
vigorously
yes
you
are
all
my
coins
and
curios
gone
why
you
young
thief
hold
on
interrupted
andy
resisting
the
savage
jerk
of
his
captor
do
you
abuse
me
till
you
know
who
i
am
yes
your
place
has
been
burglarized
i
see
that
now
oh
do
you
sneered
the
man
thanks
yes
sir
i
saw
two
men
come
out
of
the
cellar
here
an
hour
ago
i
did
understand
then
but
i
do
now
from
the
cellar
well
we
investigate
the
cellar
better
not
advised
andy
at
least
not
just
yet
well
you
a
cool
one
why
not
because
there
a
bear
down
there
a
what
cried
the
man
incredulously
a
bear
escaped
from
the
circus
say
i
just
thought
of
it
have
the
burglars
taken
much
oh
you
innocent
are
you
flared
out
the
man
i
certainly
am
answered
andy
calmly
did
they
take
much
my
hobby
is
rare
coins
with
the
missing
curios
i
guess
they
got
about
two
thousand
dollars
worth
would
the
stuff
make
quite
a
bundle
asked
andy
with
the
curios
i
guess
five
pound
candlesticks
two
large
silver
servers
the
coins
were
set
on
metal
squares
and
would
make
bulk
and
weight
i
have
an
idea
began
andy
no
let
me
explain
first
please
listen
sir
you
will
think
differently
about
me
when
i
tell
you
my
story
go
ahead
growled
his
captor
andy
recited
his
chase
of
the
bear
and
its
denouement
then
he
added
if
those
two
men
were
the
burglars
they
got
in
by
way
of
the
cellar
they
came
out
through
the
cellar
window
i
theorize
they
came
down
into
the
cellar
with
their
plunder
they
disturbed
the
bear
and
big
bob
went
for
them
when
i
saw
them
they
were
i
bet
they
dropped
their
booty
in
their
wild
rush
for
escape
eh
i
hope
so
let
find
out
the
man
appeared
to
believe
andy
he
released
his
hold
on
him
just
as
they
came
out
on
the
front
porch
andy
spoke
up
there
are
the
circus
people
they
soon
fix
mr
bear
a
boxed
wagon
had
driven
from
the
road
into
the
yard
it
held
six
men
the
chief
animal
trainer
jumped
down
from
the
vehicle
followed
by
the
head
hostler
four
subordinates
followed
carrying
ropes
muzzles
pikes
and
one
of
them
a
stick
having
on
its
end
a
big
round
cork
filled
with
fine
needles
i
glad
you
come
said
andy
running
forward
to
meet
them
big
bob
is
in
there
he
explained
to
the
trainer
pointing
to
the
cellar
you
a
good
one
wildwood
commended
the
trainer
in
an
approving
tone
how
did
you
ever
work
it
andy
explained
while
the
trainer
selected
a
muzzle
for
the
bear
and
armed
himself
with
the
device
then
he
went
to
the
cellar
door
shut
it
quick
after
me
he
said
come
when
i
call
andy
ran
around
to
the
broken
window
as
soon
as
the
trainer
was
inside
the
cellar
he
watched
the
man
approach
big
bob
the
bear
snarled
made
a
stand
and
showed
his
teeth
one
punch
of
the
device
across
his
nostrils
sent
him
bellowing
a
second
on
one
ear
brought
him
to
the
floor
the
trainer
pounced
on
him
and
adjusted
the
muzzle
over
his
head
then
he
deftly
whipped
some
hobbles
on
his
front
paws
he
yelled
to
his
assistants
they
hurried
into
the
cellar
and
soon
emerged
dragging
big
bob
after
them
the
owner
of
the
place
had
stood
by
watching
these
proceedings
silently
while
the
others
dragged
the
bear
to
the
boxed
wagon
the
trainer
approached
him
if
there
any
bill
for
damages
just
name
it
he
spoke
i
tell
you
that
mighty
soon
answered
the
man
he
dashed
into
the
cellar
and
andy
heard
him
utter
a
glad
shout
he
came
out
carrying
two
old
satchels
throwing
them
on
the
ground
he
opened
them
they
were
filled
with
coins
and
curios
the
man
ran
these
over
eagerly
he
looked
up
with
a
face
supremely
satisfied
not
a
cent
he
cried
heartily
no
no
no
damages
glad
to
have
served
you
all
right
come
on
wildwood
said
the
trainer
starting
for
the
wagon
one
minute
interrupted
the
owner
of
the
place
beckoning
to
andy
he
drew
out
his
wallet
fingered
over
some
bank
bills
selected
one
and
grasped
andy
hand
warmly
you
have
done
me
a
vast
service
he
declared
but
for
you
and
the
bear
suggested
andy
with
a
smile
all
right
nodded
the
man
only
the
bear
ca
spend
money
you
can
i
misjudged
you
let
me
make
it
right
take
that
he
released
his
grasp
of
andy
hand
momentarily
to
slap
into
his
palm
a
banknote
now
look
here
began
andy
modestly
no
you
look
there
cried
the
man
pushing
andy
towards
the
wagon
good
bye
and
good
luck
andy
ran
and
jumped
to
the
top
of
the
wagon
which
had
just
started
up
settling
himself
comfortably
he
took
a
look
at
the
banknote
his
eyes
started
and
a
flush
of
surprise
crossed
his
face
it
was
a
fifty
dollar
bill
chapter
xxviii
hey
rube
from
bad
to
worse
said
the
man
with
the
iron
jaw
correct
marco
assented
billy
blow
dejectedly
it
was
three
weeks
after
the
start
of
the
southern
tour
of
the
circus
marco
the
clown
midget
miss
stella
starr
andy
and
about
a
dozen
others
were
seated
or
strolling
around
the
performers
tent
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
every
face
in
the
crowd
looked
anxious
some
disheartened
and
desperate
bad
luck
attended
the
southern
trip
of
the
show
they
had
reached
montgomery
in
the
midst
of
a
terrific
rain
storm
two
animal
cars
had
been
derailed
and
wrecked
on
the
route
three
days
later
a
wind
storm
nearly
tore
the
main
top
to
tatters
some
of
the
performers
fell
sick
due
to
the
change
of
climate
others
foresaw
trouble
and
joined
other
shows
in
the
north
the
season
started
out
badly
and
kept
it
up
the
attendance
as
they
left
the
big
cities
was
disastrously
light
they
had
to
cut
out
one
or
two
towns
here
and
there
on
account
of
bad
roads
and
accidents
now
the
show
had
reached
lacon
and
after
more
trouble
found
itself
stalled
to
be
stalled
andy
had
learned
was
to
be
very
nearly
stranded
no
salaries
had
been
paid
for
a
full
fortnight
some
of
the
performers
had
gotten
out
executions
against
the
show
aside
from
this
on
account
of
the
absence
of
many
attractions
advertised
in
the
show
bills
disappointed
audiences
were
showing
an
ugly
spirit
the
show
was
tied
up
by
local
creditors
who
would
not
allow
it
to
leave
town
until
their
bills
were
paid
to
make
matters
worse
sim
dewey
the
treasurer
of
the
show
had
run
away
with
eleven
thousand
dollars
two
days
before
this
comprised
the
active
capital
of
the
show
not
a
trace
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
mean
thief
had
been
discovered
all
these
facts
were
known
to
the
performers
and
over
the
same
they
were
brooding
that
dismal
rainy
afternoon
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
manager
here
he
is
spoke
an
eager
voice
and
scripps
bustled
into
the
tent
he
rubbed
his
hands
briskly
and
smiled
at
everybody
but
andy
saw
that
this
was
all
put
on
lines
of
care
and
anxiety
showed
about
the
plucky
manager
eyes
and
lips
well
my
friends
he
spoke
at
once
we
arrived
at
a
decision
good
commented
marco
let
have
it
i
have
had
a
talk
with
the
lawyers
who
hold
the
executions
against
the
show
i
have
suggested
four
nights
and
two
matinees
at
papering
four
counties
liberally
we
announce
only
the
attractions
we
really
have
so
there
can
be
no
kicking
what
is
taken
in
the
treasurer
is
to
hand
over
to
the
sheriff
he
is
to
pay
fifty
per
cent
on
claims
against
us
the
balance
minus
expenses
is
to
go
for
salaries
i
should
say
that
we
can
pay
each
performer
a
full
half
salary
there
the
situation
friends
what
do
you
say
satisfactory
nodded
marco
billy
blow
i
got
pretty
heavy
expenses
with
a
wife
in
the
hospital
said
the
clown
in
a
subdued
tone
but
i
try
and
make
half
salary
do
miss
starr
the
equestrienne
smiled
brightly
take
care
of
the

shook
the
glittering
diamond
pendants
in
her
pretty
pink
ears

bowed
the
manager
choking
up
a
trifle
andy
wildwood
i
a
mere
speck
in
the
show
said
andy
but
i
stick
if
there
is
a
cent
of
salary
it
the
last
ditch
for
my
good
true
friends
mr
scripps
the
manager
turned
aside
to
hide
his
emotion
friends
he
resumed
an
instant
later
you
break
me
all
up
with
this
kind
of
talk
you
a
royal
good
lot
i
wired
harding
that
he
must
help
us
out
stick
to
your
posts
and
no
one
shall
lose
a
dollar
there
was
not
a
dissent
to
his
proposition
as
he
completed
calling
the
list
of
performers
andy
action
shamed
some
into
coming
into
the
arrangements
the
manager
words
encouraged
others
while
some
few
answered
grudgingly
the
compact
was
made
unanimous
there
a
crowd
of
hard
roughs
trying
to
make
trouble
concluded
scripps
leave
that
to
the
tent
men
give
the
best
show
you
know
how
try
and
please
the
crowds
and
i
guess
we
win
out
every
act
went
excellently
at
the
evening
performance
up
to
about
the
middle
of
the
programme
andy
did
his
level
best
he
won
an
encore
by
a
trick
somersault
old
benares
had
taught
him
billy
blow
was
at
his
funniest
he
had
the
audience
in
fine
good
humor
little
midget
himself
to
follow
in
his
father
lead
marco
was
a
pronounced
success
miss
stella
starr
made
one
of
her
horses
dance
a
graceful
round
to
the
tune
of
dixie
and
the
audience
went
wild
andy
in
street
dress
came
into
the
canvas
passageway
near
the
orchestra
as
the
trick
elephants
were
led
into
the
ring
the
manager
nodded
to
him
andy
saw
that
he
was
pleased
the
way
things
were
going
for
all
that
he
observed
that
scripps
kept
his
eye
pretty
closely
on
a
rough
crowd
occupying
seats
near
the
entrance
they
seemed
to
be
of
a
general
group
they
talked
loudly
and
passed
all
kinds
of
comments
on
the
various
acts
finally
one
of
their
number
shied
a
carrot
into
the
ring
striking
the
elephant
trainer
the
latter
caught
his
cue
instantly
at
a
word
from
the
ringmaster
he
picked
up
the
vegetable
made
a
profound
bow
to
the
sender
juggled
it
cleverly
with
his
training
wand
and
turned
the
tables
completely
as
the
smart
baby
elephant
caught
it
on
the
fly
cat
calls
rang
out
derisively
from
a
lot
of
boys
directed
at
the
group
of
rowdies
from
the
midst
of
whom
the
carrot
had
been
thrown
then
a
man
arose
unsteadily
from
that
mob
and
stumbled
over
the
ring
ropes
the
ringmaster
his
face
very
stern
and
very
white
stepped
forward
to
intercept
him
what
do
you
want
he
demanded
man
insulted
me
going
to
lick
him
hiccoughed
the
rowdy
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
elephant
trainer
leave
the
ring
ordered
the
ringmaster
me
guess
not
will
i
boys
he
demanded
of
his
special
crowd
of
cronies
no
no
go
on
have
it
out
a
good
many
timid
ones
arose
from
their
seats
the
ringmaster
scented
trouble
stepping
squarely
up
to
the
drunken
loafer
his
hand
shot
out
in
a
flash
and
caught
the
fellow
squarely
under
the
jaw
he
knocked
him
five
feet
across
the
ropes
where
he
landed
like
a
clod
of
earth
in
a
heap
instantly
there
was
an
uproar
the
orchestra
stopped
playing
the
manager
ran
forward
and
put
up
his
hand
we
will
have
order
here
at
any
cost
he
shouted
officer
to
the
guard
at
the
entrance
call
the
police
with
wild
yells
some
fifty
of
the
group
from
which
the
drunken
rowdy
had
come
sprang
from
the
benches
they
jumped
over
the
ropes
crowding
into
the
ring
and
making
for
the
manager
ring
men
ran
forward
to
repel
them
fists
brandished
and
cudgels
too
the
circus
men
went
down
among
flying
heels
then
arose
a
cry
heard
for
the
first
time
by
the
excited
andy
never
later
recalled
without
a
thrill
as
he
realized
from
that
experience
its
terrific
portent
it
was
the
rallying
cry
of
the
circus
folk
the
call
in
distress
for
speedy
reliant
help
as
if
by
magic
the
echoes
took
up
the
call
andy
heard
them
respond
from
the
farthest
haunts
of
the
circus
grounds
from
under
the
benches
through
the
main
entrance
under
the
loose
side
flaps
a
rallying
army
sprang
into
being
stake
men
wagon
men
cooks
hostlers
candy
butchers
came
flying
from
every
direction
every
one
of
them
had
found
a
weapon
a
stake
like
skilled
soldiers
they
grouped
and
bore
down
on
the
intruders
like
an
avalanche
women
were
shrieking
fainting
on
the
benches
children
were
crying
the
audience
was
in
a
wild
turmoil
some
benches
broke
down
the
scene
was
one
of
riotous
confusion
suddenly
a
shot
rang
out
then
andy
had
a
final
sight
of
crashing
clubs
and
mad
bleeding
faces
as
some
one
pulled
the
rope
the
big
chandelier
came
down
with
a
crash
precipitating
the
tent
in
so
excited
was
andy
that
grasping
a
stake
he
was
about
to
dash
into
the
midst
of
the
conflict
the
manager
pushed
him
back
get
out
of
this
he
ordered
quickly
look
to
the
women
and
children
our
men
will
see
to
it
that
those
low
loafers
get
all
they
came
for
wildwood
spoke
marco
rushing
up
to
andy
just
here
they
have
cut
the
guy
ropes
of
the
performers
tent
i
must
get
to
my
family
look
out
for
miss
starr
here
she
is
chapter
xxix
a
free
trolley
ride
the
young
acrobat
turned
in
time
to
see
the
performers
tent
wobble
inwards
miss
starr
quite
flustered
ran
rapidly
to
escape
being
caught
in
its
drooping
folds
following
her
looking
worn
out
and
anxious
carrying
midget
in
his
arms
was
billy
blow
get
them
out
of
this
cried
marco
holding
up
the
flap
of
the
canvas
passage
way
here
let
me
take
him
directed
andy
you
not
equal
to
the
heavy
load
he
removed
midget
from
the
clown
arms
and
led
the
way
to
the
outer
air
yells
and
shots
sounded
from
the
main
tent
outside
there
was
a
swaying
excited
mob
andy
evaded
them
leading
the
way
to
the
street
lining
the
circus
grounds
at
one
side
look
there
suddenly
exclaimed
the
clown
in
a
gasping
tone
the
main
tent
was
on
fire
a
mob
was
trying
to
pull
down
the
menagerie
tent
hi
yelled
the
leader
of
a
gang
of
boys
rushing
past
them
and
halting
here
some
show
folks
pelt
them
cried
another
voice
they
wo
pay
my
father
his
feed
bill
an
egg
flittered
towards
the
fugitives
it
struck
miss
starr
on
the
back
soiling
her
pretty
dress
andy
ran
back
midget
held
on
one
arm
he
let
drive
with
his
free
hand
and
knocked
the
egg
thrower
head
over
heels
this
was
the
signal
for
a
wild
riot
the
crowd
of
young
hoodlums
pressed
close
on
andy
and
he
retreated
to
the
others
take
him
miss
starr
he
said
quickly
placing
midget
in
her
arms
hurry
to
the
lighted
street
yonder
a
rain
of
stones
came
towards
them
andy
ran
back
at
the
crowd
in
turn
he
sent
four
of
them
reeling
with
vigorous
fisticuffs
then
he
rejoined
his
friends
a
trolley
car
stood
at
one
side
of
the
street
the
boys
had
yelled
for
help
from
others
of
their
kind
and
their
numbers
increased
dangerously
the
motorman
of
the
trolley
car
had
neglected
his
duty
and
joined
a
gaping
crowd
at
a
corner
riot
and
enmity
to
the
circus
people
was
in
the
air
andy
formed
a
speedy
decision
quick
he
ordered
get
into
that
car
a
brickbat
knocked
off
his
hat
a
second
smashed
a
window
in
the
car
as
miss
starr
and
the
others
got
aboard
two
big
fellows
pounced
upon
andy
he
met
one
with
a
blow
that
laid
him
flat
with
a
trick
leap
he
landed
his
feet
against
the
stomach
of
the
other
sending
him
reeling
back
breathless
andy
made
a
jump
over
the
front
railing
of
the
car
another
deluge
of
missiles
struck
the
car
he
noticed
that
his
friends
were
safely
aboard
andy
noticed
too
that
the
crank
handle
of
the
motor
box
was
in
place
anywhere
for
safety
from
that
mob
he
thought
the
car
started
up
shouts
missiles
running
forms
pursued
it
andy
stopped
for
nothing
he
put
on
full
speed
as
he
turned
a
sharp
corner
andy
caught
sight
of
a
mass
of
light
flames
shooting
upward
a
crowd
was
in
pursuit
of
the
car
shouts
shots
and
the
roars
of
the
animals
in
the
menagerie
caused
a
wild
din
his
inclinations
lured
him
back
to
the
scene
of
the
excitement
his
duty
however
seemed
plain
to
follow
out
marco
instructions
and
convey
his
charges
to
a
place
of
safety
at
a
cross
street
some
one
hailed
the
car
andy
simply
shot
ahead
the
faster
soon
they
reached
the
limits
of
the
town
andy
bent
his
ear
and
caught
the
distant
clang
of
the
trolley
wagon
he
had
stolen
a
car
and
they
were
in
pursuit
the
general
temper
was
adverse
to
the
circus
folks
andy
kept
the
car
going
miss
starr
came
to
the
front
door
of
the
car
and
stepped
out
on
the
platform
beside
andy
brave
boy
she
said
simply
miss
starr
what
are
your
plans
he
asked
anything
to
get
away
from
this
horrid
town
she
said
i
am
not
afraid
but
what
our
tent
men
will
teach
that
mob
a
lesson
they
always
do
in
these
riots
i
have
seen
a
dozen
of
them
in
my
time
the
police
too
will
finally
restore
order
as
to
the
show
though
the
southern
trip
is
over
then
you
do
want
to
go
back
to
lacon
why
should
we
our
traps
are
probably
burned
or
stolen
if
not
they
will
be
sent
on
to
us
on
direction
the
show
ca
possibly
survive
billy
and
his
boy
could
stand
the
strain
of
any
more
trouble
no
sighed
the
equestrienne
it
is
plain
that
we
must
seek
another
position
andy
again
heard
the
gong
of
the
repair
wagon
he
thought
fast
putting
on
renewed
speed
he
never
halted
until
they
had
covered
about
four
miles
here
was
a
little
cluster
of
houses
he
stopped
the
car
come
with
me
quick
he
directed
his
friends
entering
the
car
and
taking
up
midget
in
his
arms
andy
had
been
over
this
territory
the
day
previous
doing
some
exigency
service
he
led
the
way
down
a
quiet
street
after
walking
about
four
squares
they
reached
railroad
tracks
and
a
little
station
this
was
locked
up
and
dark
within
on
the
platform
however
was
a
box
ready
for
shipment
with
a
red
lantern
beside
it
i
hope
a
train
comes
soon
thought
andy
quite
anxiously
as
he
caught
the
echo
of
the
repair
wagon
gong
nearer
than
before
there
a
whistle
said
little
midget
that
so
responded
andy
bending
his
ear
going
north
too
i
hope
it
a
train
and
i
hope
it
comes
along
in
time
in
time
for
what
inquired
midget
andy
did
not
reply
he
could
estimate
the
progress
of
the
pursuing
wagon
from
gong
sounds
and
shouts
in
the
distance
he
traced
its
halt
apparently
at
the
stranded
car
then
the
gong
sounded
again
andy
glanced
down
the
street
they
had
come
two
flashing
wobbling
lights
gleamed
in
the
distance
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
railway
station
they
guessed
us
out
said
andy
of
course
they
can
only
delay
us
but
that
counts
just
now
if
the
train
she
coming
sang
out
midget
in
a
nervous
voice
andy
nerves
were
on
a
severe
strain
a
locomotive
rounded
a
curve
the
trolley
wagon
was
still
a
distant
the
engine
slowed
down
to
a
stop
the
repair
rig
with
flying
horses
attached
less
than
a
square
away
the
baggage
coach
door
opened
a
man
jumped
out
and
started
to
put
the
box
aboard
hold
on
through
train
he
yelled
at
andy
that
all
right
quick
get
aboard
he
urged
his
companions
andy
glanced
from
the
windows
of
the
coach
they
entered
as
the
train
started
up
with
a
jerk
he
saw
the
trolley
wagon
dash
up
to
the
platform
a
police
officer
and
some
company
men
jumped
off
just
in
time
murmured
andy
with
satisfaction
as
the
station
flashed
from
view
the
coach
was
nearly
empty
he
found
a
double
seat
miss
starr
uttered
a
great
sigh
of
relief
poor
billy
blow
sank
down
thoroughly
tired
out
midget
laughed
i
hope
it
a
long
ride
he
said
i
afraid
spoke
miss
starr
it
wo
be
midge
see
and
she
opened
a
little
purse
showing
only
a
few
silver
coins
i
have
some
money
in
a
bank
in
new
york
but
that
does
not
help
us
at
the
present
moment
i
sent
all
i
had
to
my
poor
wife
announced
the
clown
dejectedly
that
all
right
broke
in
andy
cheerily
here
a
route
list
and
he
picked
up
a
timetable
from
the
next
seat
can
you
tell
me
where
this
train
is
bound
for
he
inquired
politely
of
a
gentleman
occupying
the
opposite
seat
baltimore
that
sounds
good
said
miss
starr
there
was
a
show
there

the
equestrienne

i
wanted
it
to

up
a
fifty
dollar
bill

andy
with
his
knife
ripped

cried
waving

gaily

the
train
while

lasts
billy
blow
choked
up
he
directed
one
grateful
glance
at
andy
then
he
snuggled
midget
close
and
hid
his
face
against
him
miss
starr
put
a
trembling
hand
on
andy
arm
a
bright
tear
sparkled
in
her
eye
good
as
gold
she
said
softly
and
true
blue
to
the
core
thank
you
i
think
i
get
a
drink
of
water
said
andy
covering
his
own
emotion
at
this
display
of
others
by
a
subterfuge
he
went
to
the
end
of
the
car
at
the
moment
he
put
out
his
hand
for
the
glass
under
the
water
tank

person
from
a
near
seat

and
he
went
back
to
his
friends
andy
told
them
of
meeting
luke
and
the
whereabouts
of
the
big
show
just
then
the
conductor
came
into
the
car
and
they
had
to
make
a
rapid
decision
let
us
get
to
baltimore
anyway
suggested
the
clown
it
nearer
home
and
my
wife
andy
paid
their
fares
miss
starr
briefly
told
the
conductor
of
their
mishaps

lacon
her
eloquent
sympathetic
eyes

midget
a
free
ride
andy
got
pillows
for
his
three
friends
and
some
coffee
and
pie
from
the
adjoining
buffet
car
he
saw
them
comfortably
disposed
of
for
the
night
and
then
went
back
to
luke
they
sat
down
close
together
two
pleased
jolly
friends
andy
interested
luke
immensely
by
reciting
his
vivid
experiences
since
they
had
parted
by
the
way
luke
he
observed
at
last
there
something
i
missed
hearing
from
you
at
tipton
remember
let
see
said
luke
musingly
oh
yes
you
mean
about
your
being
an
heir
that
it
luke
became
animated
at
once
i
often
thought
about
that
he
said
you
know
i
was
all
struck
of
a
heap
when
you
first
told
me
your
name
yes
and
asked
if
you
was
andy
wildwood
the
heir
do
you
remember
exactly
well
it
was
funny
but
early
on
the
day
i
came
to
the
circus
i
was
tramping
it
along
a
creek
about
three
miles
out
of
town
i
should
think
i
lay
down
to
rest
among
some
bushes
ten
minutes
after
i
got
there
a
boat
rowed
by
some
persons
came
along
they
beached
it
right
alongside
the
brush
then
one
of
them
a
boy
lifted
a
mail
bag
from
the
bottom
of
the
skiff
a
mail
bag
a
boy
repeated
andy
with
a
start
of
intelligence
did
you
hear
his
name
yes
in
a
talk
that
followed
the
man
with
him
called
him
jim
jim
tapp
murmured
andy
he
called
the
man
murdock
i
thought
so
andy
said
to
himself
they
put
up
that
mail
robbery
they
cut
open
the
bag
and
took
out
a
lot
of
letters
continued
luke
a
few
of
them
had
money
in
them
this
they
pocketed
tearing
up
the
letters
and
throwing
them
into
the
creek
there
was
one
letter
the
boy
kept
he
read
it
over
and
over
when
they
had
got
through
with
the
letters
he
said
to
the
man
that
it
was
funny
what
was
funny
asked
andy
why
he
said
there
was
a
letter
putting
him
on
to
big
as
he
called
it
he
said
the
letter
told
about
a
secret
about
a
fortune
the
writer
had
discovered
he
said
the
letter
was
to
a
boy
who
would
never
know
his
good
luck
if
they
did
tell
him
he
said
to
the
man
there
was
something
to
think
over
he
chuckled
as
he
bragged
how
they
would
make
a
big
stake
juggling
the
fortune
of
the
heir
andy
wildwood
i
do
understand
it
at
all
said
andy
but
it
is
a
singular
story
for
a
fact
well
that
all
i
know
about
it
the
minute
i
heard
your
name
of
course
i
recalled
where
i
had
heard
it
before
of
course
nodded
andy
thoughtfully
after
that
the
conversation
lagged
luke
soon
fell
asleep
for
over
two
hours
however
andy
kept
trying
to
figure
out
how
he
could
possibly
be
an
heir
who
had
written
the
letter
and
to
whom
it
had
been
addressed
the
next
day
they
arrived
at
baltimore
a
morning
paper
contained
a
dispatch
from
lacon
the
circus
men
had
nearly
killed
of
the
mob
of
roughs
the
police
had
restored
order
but
fire
and
riot
had
put
the
show
out
of
business
miss
starr
wired
to
the
town
in
delaware
where
the
big
show
was
playing
luke
had
gone
on
to
join
it
by
noon
she
received
a
satisfactory
reply
then
she
telegraphed
to
lacon
about
their
traps
directing
the
manager
where
to
send
them
that
evening
after
a
long
talk
over
their
prospects
the
four
refugees
took
the
train
for
dover
the
next
morning
miss
starr
billy
midget
and
andy
went
to
the
headquarters
of
the
biggest
show
on
earth
andy
had
a
chance
to
inspect
it
while
waiting
for
bob
sanderson
the
assistant
manager
who
was
a
distant
relative
of
miss
stella
starr
its
mammoth
proportions
fairly
staggered
him
its
details
were
bewildering
in
their
system
and
perfection
alongside
of
it
the
circus
he
had
recently
belonged
to
was
merely
a
side
show
sanderson
was
a
brisk
fellow
he
soon
settled
on
an
engagement
for
miss
starr
and
billy
and
midget
for
the
rest
of
the
season
i
do
think
i
can
use
the
boy
though
he
said
glancing
at
andy
then
you
ca
have
us
said
the
equestrienne
promptly
bob
you
and
i
are
old
friends
but
not
better
ones
than
myself
and
andy
wildwood
he
stood
by
us
through
thick
and
thin
he
makes
a
good
showing
in
the
ring
why
before
the
benares
brothers
left
us
they
were
training
him
for
one
of
the
best
acts
ever
done
on
the
trapeze
is
that
so
spoke
sanderson
looking
interested
the
benares
brothers
joined
us
only
last
week
here
give
me
five
minutes
miss
starr
you
must
let
me
stand
in
your
way
of
a
good
engagement
said
andy
as
the
assistant
manager
left
the
tent
it
the
four
of
us
or
none
asserted
the
determined
little
lady
sanderson
came
bustling
in
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
all
right
he
announced
brusquely
i
take
the
boy
on
you
never
regret
it
declared
stella
starr
positively
chapter

conclusion
bravo
clever
amid
deafening
applause
old
benares
and
thacher
retired
from
the
sawdust
ring
bowing
profusely
with
a
deep
sense
of
pride
and
satisfaction
between
them
hands
joined
in
the
group
of
three
andy
wildwood
imitated
their
graceful
acknowledgment
of
the
plaudits
of
the
vast
concourse
in
the
great
metropolitan
amphitheatre
wildwood
declared
thacher
as
they
backed
towards
the
room
you
made
a
hit
it
is
so
cried
old
benares
with
sparkling
eyes
we
are
a
three
now
the
three
benares
brothers
andy
was
dizzy
with
exultation
and
delight
it
was
the
first
night
of
the
biggest
show
on
earth
in
new
york
city
for
a
week
he
had
been
in
training
for
the
fantastic
trapeze
act
which
had
won
thunders
of
approbation
the
benares
brothers
had
appeared
in
the
amphitheatre
dome
on
a
double
trapeze
after
several
clever
specialties
the
ringmaster
suddenly
stepped
forward
he
lifted
his
hand
the
orchestra
stopped
playing
raising
a
pistol
the
ringmaster
directed
it
aloft
bang
crash
went
the
orchestra
and
from
a
box
suspended
over
the
trapezes
the
bottom
suddenly
dropped
out
following
an
agile
youthful
form
shot
down
through
space
quick
as
lightning
the
benares
brothers
swung
by
their
feet
joined
hands
in
and
the
descending
form
andy
wildwood
catching
at
the
wrists
of
thacher
was
swung
back
in
a
twenty
foot
circle
crash
again
the
orchestra
andy
was
flung
through
space
across
to
old
benares
a
plaything
in
benares
catching
at
the
feet
of
thacher
andy
tailing
on
in
a
graceful
descent
thrilling
the
delighted
audience
the
act
was
not
so
difficult
but
it
was
neat
rapid
unique
andy
wildwood
felt
that
at
last
he
was
a
acrobat
the
manager
came
back
to
compliment
him
billy
blow
looked
delighted
miss
stella
starr
said
andy
we
are
all
proud
of
you
the
next
morning
papers
gave
him
special
notice
luke
belding
whispered
to
him
to
demand
double
salary
andy
walked
from
his
boarding
house
the
next
morning
feeling
certain
that
he
had
made
very
substantial
progress
during
his
sixty
days
of
circus
life
he
was
passing
a
row
of
houses
on
a
side
street
when
a
cab
drove
up
to
the
curb
andy
casually
glanced
at
the
passenger
as
he
crossed
the
sidewalk
then
he
gave
a
great
start
it
ca
be
he
ejaculated
then
he
added
instantly
yes
i
know
him
among
a
thousand
sim
dewey
the
man
entered
an
open
doorway
and
andy
ran
after
him
he
heard
the
fellow
ascend
a
pair
of
stairs
and
knock
at
a
door
oh
good
morning
mr
vernon
gracious
exclaimed
andy
aunt
lavinia
here
was
a
stirring
situation
there
could
be
no
mistake
despite
a
false
moustache
and
a
pair
of
dark
eyeglasses
andy
had
recognized
the
defaulting
cashier
of
the
disbanded
circus
beyond
dispute
he
had
recognized
the
welcoming
tones
above
as
belonging
to
his
aunt
miss
lavinia
talcott
it
like
dreaming
mused
andy
all
this
happening
together
and
here
in
new
york
city
why
what
ever
brought
aunt
lavinia
here
where
did
she
ever
get
acquainted
with
that
scamp
andy
felt
that
he
had
an
urgent
duty
to
perform
here
was
a
mystery
to
explore
a
villain
to
capture
he
went
softly
up
the
stairs
the
place
was
a
respectable
boarding
house
he
concluded
stealing
softly
past
a
door
he
went
up
a
second
pair
of
stairs
not
five
feet
away
from
an
open
transom
andy
could
now
look
into
a
room
containing
three
persons
a
motherly
dignified
old
woman
sat
in
a
big
arm
chair
near
her
was
andy
aunt
smiling
and
simpering
up
at
dewey
the
latter
dressed
to
kill
was
bowing
like
a
french
dancing
master
dewey
sat
down
the
chaperone
who
seemed
to
be
the
landlady
did
not
engage
in
a
brief
conversation
that
ensued
within
the
room
at
its
conclusion
andy
saw
his
aunt
hand
dewey
a
folded
piece
of
paper
the
defaulting
circus
cashier
gallantly
bowed
over
her
extended
hand
and
came
out
of
the
room
hold
on
sim
dewey
spoke
andy
down
the
stairs
in
a
flash
and
seizing
dewey
arm
on
the
landing
eh
hello
wildwood
yes
it
me
said
andy
a
word
with
you
sir
as
to
what
business
you
have
with
my
aunt
then
the
stolen
eleven
thousand
dollars
if
you
please
dewey
had
turned
deadly
white
he
glared
desperately
at
andy
and
tried
to
wrench
his
arm
free
shall
i
arouse
the
street
demanded
andy
sternly
it
jail
for
you
crack
the
treacherous
dewey
had
slipped
one
hand
behind
him
he
had
drawn
a
slung
shot
from
his
pocket
it
struck
andy
head
and
he
went
down
with
a
sense
of
sickening
giddiness
stop
him
shouted
andy
crawling
across
the
landing
dewey
made
a
leap
of
four
steps
at
a
time
out
of
my
way
he
yelled
at
some
obstacle
hold
on
mister
andy
arose
to
his
feet
with
difficulty
he
clung
to
the
banister
descending
the
stairs
as
a
frightful
clatter
rang
out
a
boy
about
his
own
age
coming
up
the
stairs
had
collided
with
dewey
both
tripped
up
and
rolled
to
the
front
entry
the
boy
got
up
unhurt
dewey
groaning
fell
back
and
lay
prostrate
one
limb
bent
up
under
him
andy
was
still
weak
and
but
he
acted
promptly
for
the
occasion
he
saw
that
dewey
had
broken
a
limb
and
was
practically
helpless
he
glanced
out
at
the
driver
of
the
cab
he
was
an
old
fellow
andy
ran
out
to
him
and
spoke
a
few
quick
words
with
dewey
writhing
moaning
and
resisting
this
man
andy
and
the
strange
boy
carried
him
to
the
cab
andy
directed
the
boy
to
get
up
with
the
driver
he
got
inside
the
cab
with
dewey
a
hysterical
shriek
rang
out
at
the
street
doorway
andy
saw
his
aunt
wildly
wringing
her
hands
the
maiden
lady
was
held
back
from
pursuing
the
cab
by
the
landlady
within
ten
minutes
the
cab
delivered
dewey
at
a
police
station
and
andy
told
his
story
to
the
precinct
captain
they
found
in
a
secret
pocket
on
the
defaulting
cashier
certificates
of
deposit
to
the
amount
of
ten
thousand
dollars
issued
in
a
false
name
the
amount
was
a
part
of
the
stolen
circus
funds
in
another
pocket
was
discovered
a
draft
for
three
thousand
dollars
made
over
to
the
same
false
name
by
miss
lavinia
talcott
on
the
bank
at
fairview
the
police
at
once
locked
the
prisoner
up
in
a
cell
sent
for
a
surgeon
and
asked
andy
to
telegraph
to
giles
harding
the
circus
owner
at
once
when
andy
came
out
of
the
police
station
he
found
the
boy
who
had
assisted
him
waiting
for
him
he
was
a
lad
but
his
appearance
suggested
hard
luck
andy
gave
him
a
dollar
and
got
his
name
it
was
mark
hadley
andy
was
at
once
interested
when
the
boy
told
him
that
his
dead
father
had
been
a
professional
man
in
the
west
mark
hadley
had
come
to
new
york
on
the
track
of
an
old
circus
friend
of
his
father
this
man
it
turned
out
was
a
relative
of
dewey
masquerading
now
under
the
name
of
vernon
the
man
had
told
him
that
dewey
could
help
him
out
he
did
not
know
where
dewey
was
living
but
understood
he
was
about
to
marry
a
lady
living
at
the
boarding
house
where
mark
had
gone
to
meet
the
fellow
in
a
most
sensational
manner
indeed
andy
invited
mark
to
call
upon
him
later
in
the
day
gave
the
youth
his
present
address
and
proceeded
back
to
the
boarding
house
to
find
his
aunt
the
hour
that
followed
was
one
of
the
strangest
in
andy
life
there
were
reproaches
threats
cajolings
until
andy
found
out
the
true
state
of
affairs
it
was
only
after
he
had
proven
to
his
humiliated
and
chagrined
aunt
that
dewey
was
a
villain
that
miss
lavinia
broke
down
and
confessed
that
she
had
been
a
silly
sentimental
woman
it
seemed
that
the
letter
jim
tapp
and
murdock
had
secured
was
from
graham
back
at
fairview
graham
had
discovered
in
a
secret
bottom
of
the
box
andy
had
left
with
him
a
paper
referring
to
a
patent
of
andy
father
as
time
had
brought
about
this
paper
entitled
the
heirs
of
the
old
inventor
to
quite
large
royalties
on
a
new
electrical
device
which
had
come
into
practical
use
after
wildwood
death
the
plotters
had
gone
at
once
to
miss
lavinia
her
cupidity
was
aroused
she
quieted
her
conscience
by
giving
andy
ten
dollars
at
tipton
and
deciding
to
take
charge
of
the
royalty
money
till
he
was
of
age
this
was
her
story
told
amid
contrite
tears
and
shame
as
andy
proved
to
her
that
dewey
was
after
her
three
thousand
dollars
and
would
have
escaped
with
it
only
for
his
decisive
action
murdock
had
introduced
her
to
dewey
the
latter
had
pretended
to
be
in
love
with
her
had
promised
to
marry
her
and
that
day
had
induced
the
weak
silly
old
spinster
to
trust
him
with
her
little
fortune
i
have
been
a
wicked
woman
miss
lavinia
declared
i
will
make
amends
andy
you
shall
have
your
rights
come
home
with
me
not
till
my
engagement
is
over
aunt
replied
andy
and
then
only
for
a
visit
if
you
wish
it
i
love
the
circus
life
and
i
seem
to
find
just
as
many
chances
there
to
be
good
and
to
do
good
as
in
any
other
vocation
miss
lavinia
was
given
back
her
three
thousand
dollars
the

found
a
starting
place
in
the
circus
for
mark
whose
ambition

to
become
a
great
magician
they
were
a
merry
friendly
party
they
jollied
one
another
they
saw
nothing
but
sunshine
in
the
sawdust
pathway
before
them
you
are
a
grand
genius
declared
old
benares
to
andy
my
friends
one
thought
in
six
weeks
up
from
andy
the
school
boy
to
andy
the
acrobat
hold
on
now
benares
cried
andy
smilingly
that
was
because
of
my
royal
good
friends
like
you
and
your
own
grit
said
marco
you
assuredly
deserve
your
success
and
the
other
circus
people
agreed
with
marco
for
the
time
being
andy
heard
nothing
more
of
tapp
murdock
and
daley
the
days
passed
pleasantly
enough
he
did
his
work
faithfully
constantly
adding
to
his
fame
as
an
acrobat
between
andy
and
luke
belding
a
warm
friendship
sprang
up
luke
had
much
to
tell
about
himself
as
time
passed
the
lad
who
loved
animals
had
many
adventures
but
what
these
were
i
must
reserve
for
another
volume
to
be
named
luke
the
lion
tamer
or
on
the
road
with
a
great
menagerie
in
that
we
shall
not
only
follow
luke
but
also
andy
and
see
what
the
future
held
in
store
for
the
boy
acrobat
andy
are
you
glad
you
joined
the
circus
questioned
luke
one
day
after
a
particularly
brilliant
performance
in
the
ring
glad
does
express
it
was
the
quick
answer
why
it
seems
to
be
just
what
i
was
cut
out
for
i
really
believe
you
you
never
make
work
of
an
act
like
some
of
the
acrobats
it
must
be
in
my
blood
said
andy
with
a
bright
smile
anyway
i
expect
to
be
andy
the
acrobat
for
a
long
while
to
come
and
he
was
the
end
