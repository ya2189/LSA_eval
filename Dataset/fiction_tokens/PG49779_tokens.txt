was
produced
from

march
extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
the
orders
were
to
build
up
venus
make
it
sound
like
the
gateway
to
paradise
for
the
average
earthman
flying
snakes
and
tame
venusians
included
just
go
right
ahead
and
start
chewing
on
me
molock
briskly
invited
the
venusian
shad
brisbee
when
you
get
a
square
meal
i
get
a
lunch
rita
morgan
did
turn
a
hair
at
the
challenge
but
i
thought
captain
wilkerson
who
was
officially
in
charge
of
us
was
going
to
faint
no
no
no
wilkerson
screamed
molock
you
getting
us
all
into
trouble
you
sheddap
molock
said
to
wilkerson
he
turned
again
to
the
venusian
shad
brisbee
you
heard
what
i
said
if
you
want
to
try
to
start
carving
on
me
with
one
of
those
frog
stickers
you
got
stuck
in
your
belt
hop
right
to
it
but
remember
by
harry
while
you
doing
your
carving
i
going
to
be
doing
a
little
light
whittling
myself
except
for
the
needle
pistol
in
his
pocket
molock
was
unarmed
lifting
hands
as
big
as
hams
he
looked
shad
brisbee
square
in
all
of
the
venusian
eyes
that
happened
to
be
turned
toward
him
at
the
moment
molock
had
the
full
attention
of
all
six
of
those
eyes
the
expression
on
shad
brisbee
face
indicated
that
if
he
had
had
six
more
eyes
he
would
have
been
concentrating
all
of
them
on
the
antics
of
this
mad
human
shad
brisbee
was
seven
feet
tall
he
must
have
weighed
close
to
pounds
molock
six
feet
pound
frame
was
a
pygmy
beside
the
venusian
shad
brisbee
fingered
the
knives
in
his
belt
as
if
he
was
considering
accepting
molock
invitation
then
suddenly
spread
his
hands
protesting
sound
bellowed
out
of
him
but
you
landed
right
in
the
middle
of
our
dancing
ground
then
by
harry
dance
somewhere
else
molock
shouted
i
thought
at
first
that
shad
brisbee
was
going
to
explode
he
puffed
himself
up
until
he
looked
to
be
eight
feet
tall
indignation
turned
him
green
each
of
his
six
eyes
turned
yellow
and
he
glared
at
molock
out
of
all
of
them
molock
his
dancing
ground
is
sacred
wilkerson
croaked
and
to
me
staying
alive
is
sacred
molock
answered
which
is
the
sacredest
my
staying
alive
or
his
dancing
ground
but
the
way
you
acting
now
you
going
to
get
us
all
killed
wilkerson
screamed
am
i
molock
answered
watch
this
he
turned
again
to
shad
brisbee
listen
you
baboon
we
landed
in
the
middle
of
your
dancing
ground
by
accident
but
we
going
to
stay
right
where
we
are
as
long
as
we
damn
well
please
get
it
going
to
stay
here
as
long
as
we
damn
well
and
neither
you
nor
any
other
of
your
tribe
is
going
to
do
anything
about
it
i
was
holding
my
breath
wilkerson
looked
as
if
he
was
about
to
faint
only
rita
seemed
to
be
enjoying
this
scene
perhaps
she
had
illusions
that
two
brawny
giants
were
battling
for
her
which
was
a
big
mistake
on
her
part
shad
brisbee
would
have
had
her
or
any
other
human
woman
in
his
harem
as
a
gift
if
she
was
inspiring
molock
to
put
on
his
act
then
maybe
he
was
battling
for
her
sake
i
had
the
impression
that
if
wilkerson
had
thought
that
she
was
inspiring
molock
to
this
act
the
captain
would
have
drowned
her
in
the
nearest
mudhole
publicity
department
or
no
publicity
department
and
i
would
have
helped
him
shad
brisbee
puffed
himself
up
until
he
looked
as
if
he
weighed
pounds
he
fingered
his
knives
in
his
belt
shifted
his
weight
on
his
bare
splayed
feet
he
extended
two
of
his
eyes
and
looked
backward
at
the
jungle
behind
him
as
if
he
was
desperately
hoping
that
some
of
his
tribe
would
turn
up
to
help
him
dispose
of
this
brash
human
the
other
four
eyes
continued
to
glare
at
molock
there
none
of
your
tribe
around
to
help
you
molock
stated
waving
his
fists
it
just
you
and
me
shad
brisbee
shifted
uncomfortably
he
did
know
quite
what
to
make
of
us
we
were
humans
since
he
was
a
tame
venusian
he
knew
quite
a
lot
about
humans
we
had
landed
right
in
the
middle
of
the
huge
cleared
space
that
his
tribe
used
as
a
dancing
ground
this
in
itself
was
sufficient
reason
for
him
to
destroy
us
utterly
each
of
his
six
eyes
revealed
quite
clearly
that
he
longed
to
destroy
us
and
that
only
molock
was
keeping
him
from
doing
it
well
molock
said
waving
his
fists
if
you
ready
to
start
getting
that
square
meal
i
ready
to
start
eating
my
lunch
shad
brisbee
took
a
deep
breath
somewhere
inside
of
him
he
made
up
his
mind
it
is
all
right
for
you
to
land
on
our
dancing
ground
he
said
the
way
he
spoke
the
words
hurt
him
wilkerson
rita
molock
and
i
all
beamed
but
you
must
be
gone
in
one
zonar
shad
brisbee
snarled
or
i
will
tear
you
all
to
pieces
with
my
own
bare
hands
saying
these
words
did
hurt
him
he
enjoyed
every
one
of
them
judging
from
the
way
his
hands
worked
as
he
spoke
he
would
enjoy
even
more
translating
his
words
into
action
be
gone
in
one
zonar
or
else
turning
he
stalked
into
the
jungle
i
quit
breathing
again
the
smile
went
from
wilkerson
face
rita
looked
a
little
perturbed
only
molock
was
unconcerned
even
though
he
knew
that
a
zonar
was
less
than
an
hour
and
he
would
be
gone
from
this
place
in
two
weeks
and
then
only
if
we
were
lucky
did
you
see
me
him
molock
said
grinning
did
you
see
me
run
a
sandy
on
that
idiot
you
were
marvelous
simply
marvelous
rita
murmured
oh
hell
wilkerson
shouted
if
there
had
been
a
stone
wall
handy
for
him
to
butt
his
head
against
i
sure
he
would
have
felt
much
better
yaas
you
bluffed
him
you
bluffed
him
so
goddamned
good
that
all
be
dead
before
we
get
out
of
this
place
remember
this
is
his
country
this
is
his
tribal
dancing
ground
captain
i
sure
you
are
taking
much
too
negative
a
view
rita
interrupted
since
she
was
a
woman
wilkerson
could
slug
her
but
woman
or
not
he
looked
as
if
he
was
about
to
do
it
i
not
taking
nearly
as
negative
a
view
as
shad
brisbee
will
take
when
he
comes
back
and
wants
his
dancing
ground
wilkerson
said
bitterly
for
a
moment
molock
looked
worried
you
were
yelling
for
a
light
lunch
wilkerson
said
you
may
find
you
have
bitten
off
more
than
you
can
chew
now
i
going
into
that
ship
and
get
headquarters
on
the
radio
and
see
if
i
can
get
some
help
out
here
in
time
to
save
our
necks
in
the
meantime
by
thunder
you
get
ready
to
take
care
of
shad
brisbee
turning
wilkerson
stalked
toward
the
ship
indignation
bristled
in
every
step
he
took
we
followed
him
with
reluctance
beneath
my
breath
i
cursed
its
publicity
department
and
george
cooper
cooper
was
head
of
the
publicity
department
it
was
his
brilliant
idea
that
had
landed
us
here
in
the
middle
of
venus
where
shad
brisbee
was
giving
us
one
zonar
to
get
off
of
his
dancing
ground
or
else
of
course
you
know
that
has
a
monopoly
on
carrying
passengers
and
freight
to
and
from
venus
but
what
you
probably
know
is
that
from
the
financial
end
things
have
been
a
little
tough
for
the
company
now
do
go
getting
your
sympathy
aroused
about
this
poor
suffering
corporation
being
down
to
its
last
billion
credits
let
sympathize
with
itself
it
quite
capable
of
doing
the
job
very
competently
it
is
also
capable
of
hiring
boys
like
george
cooper
to
help
it
sympathize
with
itself
cooper
had
dreamed
up
the
idea
that
the
way
to
help
the
financial
situation
was
to
encourage
human
colonizing
on
venus
if
they
could
get
several
thriving
human
colonies
settled
on
the
veiled
planet
the
line
would
not
only
pick
up
revenue
from
transporting
the
colonists
to
venus
but
it
would
also
pick
up
some
profitable
freight
business
in
the
long
run
they
foresaw
a
very
happy
increase
in
traffic
one
joker
they
ran
into
right
from
the
start
was
that
nobody
but
a
damned
fool
wanted
to
go
to
venus
and
argue
with
apes
like
shad
brisbee
over
the
rights
to
their
dancing
grounds
also
nobody
wanted
to
put
up
with
the
fog
flies
and
the
flying
snakes
and
the
cooper
knew
how
to
change
all
that
we
make
films
write
books
publish
pamphlets
all
of
them
emphasizing
the
good
points
of
venus
we
make
this
planet
look
and
sound
like
a
seed
catalogue
we
soon
have
thousands
maybe
millions
of
people
coming
here
build
venus
up
make
people
see
venus
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
heaven
but
at
least
as
wonderful
as
eden
this
was
where
wilkerson
and
molock
and
rita
morgan
and
yours
truly
sam
crane
got
into
the
act
rita
who
was
the
apple
of
cooper
eye
got
the
assignment
of
taking
the
three
dimensional
movies
in
full
color
and
full
sound
that
would
make
venus
attractive
of
course
on
the
sound
side
we
had
cooper
permission
to
dub
out
the
screams
of
any
venusian
getting
swallowed
by
a
boa
constrictor
wilkerson
molock
and
i
were
included
to
fly
the
ship
and
help
rita
in
other
words
it
was
our
job
to
dig
up
the
raw
material
that
the
publicity
department
could
use
to
sell
a
bill
of
goods
to
suckers
back
on
earth
who
could
be
into
making
the
big
hop
to
venus
in
getting
these
pictures
of
eden
in
the
sky
we
had
hunted
up
the
tamest
of
all
tame
venusians
shad
brisbee
we
knew
him
he
knew
us
to
my
mind
the
fact
that
he
knew
us
was
not
to
our
advantage
in
some
ways
i
would
have
preferred
taking
our
pictures
among
some
of
the
wilder
tribes
who
did
know
us
but
george
cooper
had
decided
that
the
tame
shad
brisbee
was
just
the
lad
for
us
he
had
loaded
the
ship
with
trade
goods
and
had
told
us
where
to
go
all
of
this
might
have
worked
out
fine
if
we
had
not
damaged
the
drive
and
had
to
make
a
forced
landing
right
in
the
middle
of
shad
tribal
dancing
ground
you
may
not
know
it
but
these
venusians
are
funny
about
dancing
they
do
go
in
for
cultural
amusements
there
is
a
ball
park
or
a
library
on
the
planet
a
pin
ball
machine
a
golf
course
or
anything
else
that
might
make
life
more
cultivated
but
every
venusian
has
his
private
dancing
ground
and
every
tribe
has
a
big
one
for
amusement
the
venusians
dance
they
dance
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
they
dance
to
celebrate
the
beginning
of
a
spell
of
wet
weather
and
the
end
of
it
the
male
venusians
dance
as
their
squaws
go
out
in
the
morning
to
gather
fruits
and
vegetables
they
dance
in
the
afternoon
when
the
squaws
come
home
at
night
the
squaws
join
in
and
everybody
big
and
little
old
and
young
dances
they
hold
elaborate
contests
to
determine
who
is
the
best
tribal
dancer
he
the
chief
the
big
shot
the
boss
they
hold
contests
between
tribes
everybody
gets
drunk
everybody
dances
personally
i
say
one
thing
for
the
venusians
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
dancing
contests
were
a
better
way
to
settle
personal
and
tribal
problems
than
war
but
the
venusians
are
just
benighted
ignorant
natives
with
no
knowledge
of
the
finer
things
of
life
this
mean
they
ca
and
wo
fight
they
fight
alligators
and
flying
snakes
and
blue
tigers
but
they
just
do
fight
each
other
any
personal
or
private
quarrels
they
settle
by
dancing
it
out
i
heard
learned
professors
from
earth
lecture
on
the
vast
satisfaction
to
be
derived
from
expressing
the
kinesthetic
sense
the
rapture
that
goes
with
movements
of
the
body
the
sweet
pure
flame
of
mood
expressed
by
body
movement
and
gesture
all
of
this
may
mean
something
to
the
professors
so
far
as
i
concerned
the
venusians
just
like
to
dance
if
you
want
to
start
a
ruckus
and
but
good
just
suggest
to
one
of
the
males
that
things
would
be
a
lot
better
around
the
home
place
if
he
spent
more
of
his
time
working
and
less
dancing
if
you
want
to
start
a
real
fracas
just
come
between
a
venusian
and
his
dancing
hell
hath
no
fury
i
know
this
is
not
the
way
it
is
written
up
in
the
books
the
authors
usually
speak
of
the
quaint
venusian
dancing
customs
but
this
is
the
way
it
is
shad
brisbee
might
be
a
tame
venusian
to
the
publicity
department
but
when
we
landed
right
in
the
middle
of
his
tribe
dancing
ground
you
could
guarantee
he
would
revert
to
the
wild
state
with
wilkerson
stamping
the
ground
ahead
of
us
we
moved
toward
the
ship
an
arrow
eight
feet
long
came
out
of
the
jungle
behind
us
passed
between
us
whammed
into
the
open
lock
of
the
ship
ahead
of
us
it
beat
us
to
our
destination
but
it
did
beat
us
much
i
do
know
who
led
the
way
but
it
was
my
opinion
that
wilkerson
damned
near
beat
that
arrow
into
the
ship
jumping
into
the
ship
we
slammed
the
lock
whew
wilkerson
said
mopping
sweat
from
his
face
just
an
arrow
molock
said
heck
they
nothing
shad
brisbee
and
his
boys
will
never
get
anywhere
with
arrows
and
they
have
got
any
weapons
except
spears
clubs
knives
he
sounded
very
comfortable
about
the
situation
but
we
have
even
got
a
gun
except
for
your
spring
pistol
wilkerson
said
for
several
minutes
he
spoke
freely
and
movingly
about
george
cooper
it
had
been
cooper
idea
that
we
go
unarmed
treat
these
natives
with
friendliness
and
they
treat
you
with
friendliness
no
guns
cooper
had
decreed
wait
until
i
get
that
damned
cooper
on
the
radio
wilkerson
said
stalking
into
the
control
cabin
there
wo
be
anything
to
this
molock
said
cooper
will
send
out
a
couple
of
ships
and
blow
these
idiots
to
hell
and
gone
or
scare
to
death
let
go
into
the
galley
and
have
a
beer
we
were
starting
on
our
second
can
of
beer
when
wilkerson
stumbled
into
the
galley
he
had
a
glazed
look
in
his
eyes
and
he
was
waving
his
hands
and
sort
of
frothing
at
the
mouth
snatching
up
the
can
of
beer
molock
had
just
opened
he
drained
it
when
will
the
ships
be
here
molock
asked
wilkerson
blew
foam
from
his
lips
they
wo
he
said
what
molock
gasped
do
you
mean
those
dirty
dogs
are
going
to
leave
us
here
to
be
murdered
by
a
bunch
of
apes
cooper
was
mad
as
hell
because
we
had
crash
landed
he
wanted
to
know
what
the
hell
i
meant
by
damaging
company
property
from
the
way
he
sounded
the
cost
of
the
repairs
was
coming
out
of
his
lunch
money
i
kill
that
cooper
molock
screamed
does
he
know
our
lives
are
in
danger
he
seemed
to
think
that
maintaining
peaceful
relations
with
the
venusians
was
more
important
than
our
necks
wilkerson
explained
he
said
that
if
shad
brisbee
wanted
to
knife
us
for
landing
on
his
dancing
ground
it
was
all
right
with
and
with
him
but
rita
is
here
molock
raged
does
he
see
he
risking
the
life
of
a
woman
he
said
that
does
discriminate
between
its
employees
because
of
sex
wilkerson
answered
open
me
another
can
of
beer
somebody
i
feel
faint
let
me
at
that
radio
molock
screamed
i
want
to
talk
to
that
cooper
he
slammed
out
of
the
galley
while
he
was
gone
we
drank
beer
vigorously
when
he
returned
his
face
was
what
did
cooper
say
wilkerson
asked
he
said
that
good
publicity
was
more
important
than
our
necks
that
if
we
are
going
to
bring
colonists
here
we
have
to
be
able
to
prove
to
them
how
peaceful
venus
is
um
wilkerson
said
what
else
did
the
good
man
say
he
fired
me
molock
sounded
as
if
he
was
strangling
he
told
me
to
come
in
and
get
my
pay
when
i
asked
him
how
i
was
to
get
there
he
said
i
was
to
walk
um
wilkerson
said
well
go
right
ahead
and
start
walking
you
bluffed
shad
brisbee
once
you
can
do
it
again
you
as
bad
as
cooper
molock
screamed
shad
brisbee
would
murder
me
if
he
caught
me
outside
this
ship
i
not
a
damned
venusian
fair
game
to
him
nah
he
would
hurt
you
wilkerson
said
hell
he
just
an
ignorant
native
all
he
got
are
knives
and
clubs
and
spears
and
bows
and
arrows
just
a
native
he
easy
to
bluff
hell
you
a
human
being
he
probably
looks
on
you
as
a
sort
of
a
god
at
least
some
of
the
literature
i
saw
one
of
the
trained
seals
pounding
out
in
the
publicity
department
said
the
natives
regarded
humans
as
minor
gods
who
can
do
no
wrong
an
arrow
smashed
against
the
plastite
hull
window
bounced
off
one
point
was
definitely
to
our
advantage
no
weapon
possessed
by
the
venusians
could
get
through
the
steel
hull
or
the
plastite
view
ports
of
the
ship
we
were
as
safe
as
sardines
in
a
can
unless
the
venusians
found
a
can
opener
we
sat
in
the
galley
and
morosely
drank
beer
and
considered
how
best
to
draw
our
wills
hey
look
molock
gasped
painting
toward
the
plastite
window
at
first
glance
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
whole
venusian
race
had
put
in
its
appearance
there
were
hundreds
of
venusians
thousands
of
them
coming
from
all
directions
shad
brisbee
had
called
in
his
pals
from
miles
around
and
they
were
all
heading
our
way
wilkerson
face
went
white
this
looks
like
the
end
boys
he
said
nah
molock
answered
they
never
get
through
the
hull
figure
out
something
you
had
better
get
your
slide
rule
into
action
uh
what
was
that
was
the
ship
lurching
as
if
it
was
about
to
turn
over
from
the
ports
we
could
see
what
was
happening
venusians
were
on
both
sides
of
the
ship
those
on
one
side
were
pushing
while
those
on
the
other
side
were
pulling
when
the
ship
settled
back
the
ones
on
the
second
side
pushed
like
hell
setting
up
a
rhythmic
rocking
motion
that
was
rapidly
threatening
to
turn
the
ship
over
you
could
turn
over
a
mountain
like
this
wilkerson
whispered
as
the
ship
lurched
my
god
they
going
to
try
to
roll
the
whole
damned
ship
into
the
swamp
on
one
side
of
shad
brisbee
dancing
ground
was
jungle
on
the
other
side
was
a
deep
pool
of
muddy
water
staring
at
it
wilkerson
seemed
to
talk
out
of
a
trance
drowned
like
rats
in
a
trap
in
my
own
ship
he
took
a
deep
breath
turned
to
molock
go
out
and
bluff
shad
brisbee
now
molock
also
took
a
deep
breath
and
rose
to
his
feet
i
just
go
do
that
he
said
moving
toward
the
lock
all
of
us
were
too
stunned
to
try
to
stop
him
when
he
opened
the
outer
door
of
the
lock
the
noise
that
came
in
was
like
the
howling
of
a
forest
full
of
baboons
but
the
rocking
of
the
ship
stopped
as
soon
as
he
appeared
i
do
know
why
the
venusians
did
kill
him
before
he
had
a
chance
to
open
his
mouth
but
probably
they
were
too
surprised
at
his
appearance
to
take
immediate
action
i
want
to
talk
to
shad
brisbee
he
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
shad
appeared
in
the
throng
he
looked
more
than
seven
feet
tall
and
i
would
have
sworn
he
had
more
than
six
eyes
the
throng
grew
so
quiet
you
could
hear
these
tame
venusians
slobbering
as
they
thirsted
for
human
blood
i
dance
you
for
the
right
to
keep
our
ship
on
your
dancing
ground
until
it
is
repaired
molock
said
the
hopeless
fool
wilkerson
gasped
the
utter
idiot
you
will
dance
you
could
have
heard
shad
brisbee
scream
for
miles
around
the
idea
appalled
him
because
it
was
a
direct
challenge
and
it
also
appealed
to
him
because
he
was
absolutely
certain
that
he
or
any
other
venusian
could
any
human
who
had
ever
put
foot
on
the
veiled
planet
i
do
it
shad
brisbee
roared
make
room
for
the
dancers
his
voice
was
a
howl
that
shook
wondering
echoes
out
of
the
jungle
molock
came
back
into
the
galley
you
ca
do
it
wilkerson
gasped
these
dances
are
endurance
contests
that
big
baboon
has
done
nothing
but
dance
all
his
life
he
can
dance
straight
into
next
week
i
stalling
for
time
molock
said
i
want
you
to
get
on
that
radio
again
and
convince
that
damned
cooper
he
got
to
get
here
and
help
us
all
he
has
to
do
is
swoop
low
in
a
ship
over
this
place
and
these
baboons
will
take
to
the
jungle
or
the
swamp
to
dodge
the
rocket
blast
tell
him
i
tell
him
wilkerson
said
grimly
the
question
is
will
he
act
on
what
i
tell
him
molock
eyes
went
to
rita
honey
i
want
you
to
get
those
cameras
going
and
keep
them
going
i
want
this
recorded
for
posterity
if
for
nobody
else
rita
was
shaken
and
scared
but
there
was
good
stuff
down
inside
that
girl
will
do
she
whispered
she
got
to
her
feet
and
headed
for
the
observation
dome
in
the
top
of
the
ship
where
the
cameras
were
located
molock
turned
to
me
i
got
a
little
job
for
you
sam
out
of
his
pocket
he
slipped
the
little
needle
gun
i
going
to
have
to
dance
against
that
baboon
when
he
gets
to
dancing
real
good
and
everybody
is
all
excited
i
want
you
to
shoot
him
in
the
butt
with
one
of
these
needles
but
i
whispered
exactly
molock
said
it
wo
kill
him
but
a
couple
of
these
needles
will
slow
him
down
considerably
i
regarded
the
weapon
with
horror
but
that
means
i
have
to
go
out
there
where
all
those
venusians
are
maybe
this
was
a
heroic
thing
to
say
but
the
thought
just
popped
out
of
my
mind
anyhow
i
feeling
very
heroic
yah
molock
said
but
i
be
out
there
molock
said
i
be
out
there
dancing
all
you
got
to
do
is
squat
on
the
ground
okay
i
said
the
word
cost
me
a
desperate
effort
but
i
said
it
we
went
out
together
the
venusians
had
already
cleared
a
circle
fifty
yards
in
diameter
they
clustered
around
this
circle
like
hungry
dogs
waiting
for
the
kill
shad
brisbee
stark
naked
grinning
out
of
all
of
his
six
eyes
looking
nine
feet
tall
and
fit
to
dance
all
month
grinned
as
he
waited
in
shad
brisbee
mind
here
was
a
lamb
being
led
to
the
slaughter
shad
brisbee
and
i
had
one
thing
in
common
we
both
agreed
on
this
lamb
led
to
the
slaughter
idea
i
squatted
on
the
ground
at
the
edge
of
the
circle
and
tried
to
lose
myself
between
the
legs
of
the
venusians
towering
over
me
have
you
ever
seen
a
venusian
dance
if
you
have
you
have
missed
one
of
the
weirdest
sights
in
the
solar
system
they
do
everything
in
the
books
on
ballets
ball
room
dancing
tap
dancing
they
also
turn
and
walk
on
their
hands
they
do
things
that
no
human
being
will
ever
believe
until
he
sees
it
as
big
and
as
ponderous
as
he
was
shad
brisbee
went
into
his
act
by
turning
three
quick
back
flips
i
give
molock
credit
he
could
do
tricks
i
had
never
guessed
he
could
do
he
kept
even
with
shad
but
within
thirty
minutes
he
was
beginning
to
pant
going
round
the
circle
dancing
every
step
of
the
way
he
found
wind
to
yell
at
wilkerson
who
was
peering
from
the
lock
any
news
from
that
damned
cooper
operations
contacted
him
in
a
bar
wilkerson
yelled
cooper
said
you
could
dance
your
own
way
out
of
this
the
dirty
dog
molock
screamed
the
next
time
he
came
around
the
circle
waving
his
hands
and
bending
double
as
he
imitated
one
of
shad
brisbee
more
intricate
steps
he
whispered
to
me
bunt
him
keeping
the
little
spring
gun
out
of
sight
in
my
hand
i
waited
until
the
venusian
back
was
turned
to
me
and
pressed
the
trigger
the
spring
clicked
softly
i
caught
a
glint
of
the
needle
as
it
went
home
in
shad
backside
he
went
right
on
dancing
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
next
time
he
came
around
the
circle
molock
whispered
let
him
have
another
one
as
i
started
to
pull
the
trigger
the
sky
seemed
to
fall
down
on
top
of
me
a
venusian
hand
smashed
me
downward
no
tricks
a
venusian
voice
snarled
into
my
ear
the
gun
was
jerked
away
from
me
about
eyes
in
my
vicinity
were
concentrated
on
me
each
one
glaring
in
its
own
individual
way
i
was
given
to
understand
that
if
i
attempted
to
take
any
further
part
in
the
proceedings
i
would
be
fed
to
the
nearest
alligator
what
happened
molock
yelled
as
he
danced
by
again
they
caught
me
you
have
to
him
honestly
but
i
ca
go
much
farther
he
was
covered
with
sweat
and
his
chest
was
heaving
i
felt
like
the
lowest
kind
of
a
dog
for
having
let
him
down
molock
might
be
an
utter
damned
fool
but
when
the
chips
were
down
he
was
in
there
trying
for
all
of
us
he
had
built
all
his
hopes
on
this
trick
with
the
needle
gun
circling
the
dancing
ground
he
suddenly
stopped
stood
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
chest
heaving
you
give
up
shad
brisbee
shouted
you
quit
i
do
not
give
up
molock
wheezed
but
you
have
stop
dancing
i
have
danced
your
way
for
two
zonars
turn
about
is
fair
play
now
you
dance
my
way
your
way
astonishment
showed
in
all
of
shad
brisbee
six
eyes
you
humans
do
dance
you
do
know
how
that
where
you
wrong
molock
answered
we
know
how
to
dance
in
a
new
way
a
way
you
stupid
venusians
have
never
heard
of
i
did
know
whether
shad
brisbee
and
the
others
were
more
excited
over
the
insult
or
the
thought
of
a
new
way
to
dance
dancing
was
the
blood
of
life
to
them
no
way
venusians
not
know
shad
brisbee
shouted
we
know
about
dancing
all
steps
all
hell
you
do
know
this
way
molock
interrupted
i
doubt
if
you
could
do
it
even
if
i
taught
it
to
you
he
was
stalling
for
time
but
as
he
was
stalling
he
was
getting
his
strength
back
personally
it
was
my
opinion
that
all
he
knew
about
dancing
he
had
learned
in
a
hall
in
some
space
port
on
earth
but
if
he
wanted
to
teach
this
to
the
venusians
it
was
all
right
with
me
show
him
to
me
shad
brisbee
screamed
i
can
do
him
all
right
watch
this
weaving
forward
with
his
hands
up
molock
slugged
shad
brisbee
on
the
jaw
the
startled
venusian
almost
turned
a
somersault
as
he
went
over
backward
a
cry
of
rage
arose
both
from
shad
and
the
onlookers
kill
the
human
slaughter
him
now
you
try
to
hit
me
molock
ignored
the
cries
for
his
blood
he
weaved
away
with
his
fists
up
that
not
dancing
shad
brisbee
roared
it
kind
of
dancing
the
human
way
to
dance
molock
answered
yah
you
big
you
ca
do
it
i
held
my
breath
the
hopeless
idiot
or
maybe
genius
was
trying
to
turn
a
dancing
contest
into
a
boxing
match
and
he
did
screaming
shad
brisbee
charged
swung
a
tremendous
at
molock
jaw
dodging
molock
slugged
him
behind
the
ear
for
the
next
fifteen
minutes
to
my
awed
and
thunderously
appreciative
delight
i
watched
a
venusian
get
carved
to
pieces
molock
hit
shad
brisbee
with
everything
up
to
and
including
his
elbows
and
knees
he
hit
the
venusian
in
the
gullet
the
stomach
all
over
the
head
and
he
knocked
at
least
three
eyes
out
of
commission
it
took
him
exactly
fifteen
minutes
to
reduce
a
seven
foot
venusian
giant
to
the
status
of
a
whimpering
child
i
give
i
give
shad
brisbee
gasped
you
better
dancer
than
me
you
will
allow
us
to
stay
here
unmolested
until
we
can
get
our
ship
repaired
molock
demanded
sure
sure
i
do
that
for
you
if
you
do
one
thing
for
me
what
that
here
i
whisper
to
you
leaning
forward
shad
whispered
something
in
molock
ear
the
human
looked
a
little
surprised
and
startled
okay
he
said
it
a
deal
then
as
if
some
secret
thought
was
pleasing
him
tremendously
he
began
to
grin
i
say
it
a
deal
he
said
boys
we
go
home
now
shad
brisbee
shouted
with
awed
and
appreciative
looks
at
the
greatest
dancer
they
had
ever
seen
they
went
streaming
away
from
shad
brisbee
dancing
ground
an
equally
awed
and
appreciative
wilkerson
met
us
in
the
lock
rita
was
there
too
but
rita
was
awed
she
climbed
right
up
into
arms
did
you
get
the
pics
he
asked
her
i
got
them
darling
then
we
got
the
world
by
the
tail
honey
we
got
the
world
by
the
tail
it
took
two
weeks
to
get
our
ship
repaired
during
this
time
molock
was
a
mighty
busy
man
both
taking
pictures
of
his
own
selection
and
spending
hours
each
day
with
shad
brisbee
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
licked
shad
harbored
no
animosity
he
and
molock
struck
up
a
beautiful
friendship
when
we
finally
got
the
ship
repaired
and
was
about
ready
to
take
off
a
ship
arrived
from
headquarters
carrying
a
most
important
visitor
a
george
cooper
head
of
publicity
wearing
beautiful
clothes
his
fingers
manicured
delicately
perfumed
for
he
was
a
sensitive
man
he
descended
from
the
lock
molock
and
shad
brisbee
greeted
him
cooper
smiled
urbanely
at
them
he
wants
to
dance
shad
molock
said
try
out
your
new
step
on
him
the
one
i
been
teaching
you
with
one
single
forearm
jab
shad
brisbee
knocked
cooper
clear
back
into
the
ship
the
publicity
man
had
just
left
then
shad
turned
eagerly
to
molock
tell
me
do
i
dance
him
good
shad
molock
said
beaming
you
dance
him
beautiful
the
smile
on
molock
face
was
a
heavenly
thing
well
that
about
it
except
for
the
pics
the
ones
rita
took
of
the
dance
and
other
carefully
selected
horror
shots
of
some
of
the
less
beautiful
aspects
of
this
eden
in
the
sky
i
understand
these
pics
are
terrific
box
office
on
earth
all
we
know
is
that
they
kicking
credits
in
to
us
so
fast
that
we
all
getting
rich
wilkerson
molock
molock
and
me
of
course
we
not
exactly
trying
to
the
publicity
department
of
but
if
you
are
thinking
of
coming
to
venus
it
might
be
wise
to
see
our
picture
first
it
will
give
you
a
little
more
rounded
view
of
a
place
that
is
a
little
short
of
heaven
about
a
couple
of
billion
miles
short
of
it
and
if
you
are
thinking
of
coming
to
venus
you
had
better
take
one
other
thing
into
consideration
the
promise
molock
made
to
shad
brisbee
before
the
venusian
would
concede
defeat
in
dancing
shad
made
molock
promise
to
teach
him
this
new
and
wonderful
form
of
dancing
that
humans
knew
molock
spent
two
weeks
doing
exactly
that
which
accounts
for
the
enthusiastic
greeting
cooper
got
from
one
of
the
tame
venusians
i
understand
this
form
of
dancing
is
spreading
like
wild
fire
over
the
veiled
planet
if
you
are
thinking
of
going
to
venus
you
had
better
take
in
consideration
not
only
the
fog
flies
the
forty
foot
boa
constrictors
the
blue
tigers
but
the
fact
that
every
blasted
venusian
native
now
considers
himself
an
expert
at
human
dancing
and
spends
most
of
his
spare
time
looking
for
humans
to
practice
with
unless
you
fully
prepared
to
dance
with
these
venusians
you
had
better
think
twice
before
deciding
to
settle
on
this
eden
in
the
sky
the
end
