chapter
i
an
accident
are
you
glad
that
we
are
only
going
back
to
school
for
a
little
while
cried
billie
bradley
as
she
gave
a
little
exultant
skip
suppose
it
were
fall
and
we
were
beginning
high
billie
stop
it
commanded
laura
jordon
turning
a
pair
of
very
blue
and
very
indignant
eyes
upon
her
chum
i
thought
we
were
going
to
forget
school
for
a
little
while
well
we
not
going
back
for
anything
i
forgot
billie
was
asserting
when
violet
farrington
the
third
of
the
trio
interposed
if
you
two
are
going
to
quarrel
on
a
day
like
this
i
going
home
who
said
we
were
quarreling
cried
billie
adding
with
a
chuckle
we
just
having
what
miss
beggs
miss
beggs
being
their
english
teacher
would
call
an
discussion
listen
to
the
bright
child
cried
laura
mockingly
i
do
see
how
you
ever
get
that
way
billie
neither
do
i
replied
billie
adding
with
a
chuckle
as
they
turned
to
stare
at
her
just
natural
talent
i
guess
the
three
chums
and
three
brighter
prettier
girls
it
would
be
hard
to
find
were
on
their
way
to
the
grammar
school
which
had
just
closed
the
week
before
laura
had
forgotten
a
book
which
she
prized
highly
and
was
in
hope
that
the
janitor
a
old
fellow
would
let
her
in
long
enough
to
get
it
at
the
last
minute
she
had
asked
the
other
girls
to
go
with
her
the
three
chums
had
lived
in
north
bend
a
town
of
less
than
twenty
thousand
people
practically
all
their
lives
the
girls
loved
it
for
it
was
a
pretty
place
still
being
only
forty
miles
by
rail
from
new
york
city
they
had
been
taken
to
the
roaring
metropolis
once
in
a
while
as
a
treat
and
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
their
parents
had
succeeded
in
luring
them
home
again
among
other
things
north
bend
boasted
a
jewelry
factory
of
which
raymond
jordon
laura
father
was
the
owner
billie
father
was
the
prominent
martin
bradley
well
known
among
real
estate
and
insurance
men
and
it
was
from
him
that
billie
whose
real
name
was
beatrice
had
taken
her
brown
eyes
and
brown
hair
and
even
that
merry
irrepressible
imp
of
mischief
that
made
billie
bradley
the
most
popular
girl
in
all
north
bend
her
mother
agnes
bradley
quiet
sincere
and
beautiful
to
look
upon
kept
just
the
check
on
her
gay
young
daughter
that
the
young
girl
needed
billie
had
a
brother
chetwood
bradley
commonly
known
as
chet
a
boy
as
different
from
his
sister
as
night
is
from
day
yet
in
his
own
more
quiet
way
extremely
attractive
laura
brother
theodore
known
to
his
intimates
as
teddy
was
a
handsome
boy
as
full
of
wild
spirits
as
billie
herself
teddy
had
entertained
a
lively
admiration
for
billie
bradley
since
he
was
seven
and
she
was
six
teddy
was
tall
for
his
fifteen
years
and
had
already
made
a
name
for
himself
in
the
field
of
athletics
the
third
of
the
chums
was
violet
farrington
a
daughter
of
richard
farrington
a
lawyer
of
north
bend
and
grace
farrington
a
sweet
motherly
woman
nearly
everybody
loved
violet
who
was
tall
and
dark
and
she
also
acted
as
a
sort
of
perpetual
between
billie
and
laura
so
now
she
was
acting
again
on
this
glorious
day
in
july
when
the
roses
were
out
and
the
birds
were
singing
and
the
sun
was
shining
its
brightest
what
shall
we
do
if
we
ca
get
in
suggested
billie
waving
her
hand
to
nellie
bane
another
girl
in
her
class
who
passed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
i
suppose
we
have
to
go
home
again
answered
laura
adding
with
a
little
worried
frown
oh
i
do
hope
i
can
get
the
book
i
would
lose
it
for
anything
there
goes
amanda
peabody
cried
violet
suddenly
clutching
billie
arm
that
makes
no
difference
in
my
young
life
billie
slangily
assured
her
as
long
as
she
it
all
right
added
laura
glancing
after
the
lanky
figure
of
amanda
peabody
as
the
girl
swung
off
in
the
other
direction
amanda
peabody
was
not
popular
with
the
girls
nor
was
she
with
anybody
for
that
matter
as
far
as
the
girls
knew
she
had
not
one
friend
in
the
whole
school
amanda
was
and
freckled
and
while
these
attributes
alone
could
not
have
accounted
for
her
unpopularity
she
added
to
them
a
tendency
to
spy
upon
the
other
girls
and
then
run
and
tell
what
she
had
seen
or
heard
it
was
this
last
characteristic
that
no
girl
would
tolerate
and
so
amanda
had
lived
in
practical
ostracism
ever
since
she
had
come
to
north
bend
two
years
before
i
do
think
we
ought
to
be
too
hard
on
her
said
violet
as
they
turned
the
corner
that
brought
the
school
into
view
she
ca
help
her
mean
disposition
i
suppose
and
anyway
miss
beggs
says
there
always
some
good
to
be
found
in
everybody
maybe
said
billie
skeptically
but
hers
is
so
small
you
would
need
a
microscope
to
see
it
there
the
janitor
now
just
going
out
if
we
run
we
can
catch
him
and
run
they
did
presenting
themselves
a
minute
later
rather
red
in
the
face
and
out
of
breath
before
a
very
much
amused
janitor
hello
he
cried
his
twinkling
eyes
under
their
shaggy
brows
lighting
with
pleasure
as
he
looked
at
the
girls
are
you
young
ladies
tryin
to
catch
a
train
or
what
oh
no
no
cried
violet
eagerly
we
were
just
trying
to
catch
you
mr
heegan
an
it
mighty
flattered
i
am
said
heegan
his
irish
brogue
coming
to
the
fore
an
what
if
i
might
be
askin
you
it
a
book
we
left
here
billie
broke
in
quickly
laura
wants
to
know
if
you
will
let
us
in
long
enough
to
get
it
sure
an
i
will
that
heegan
assured
them
leading
the
way
into
the
school
yard
and
pulling
out
his
bunch
of
keys
it
must
be
a
verra
important
book
he
added
smiling
at
them
as
he
fitted
the
key
in
the
lock
to
be
bringing
you
back
to
school
after
school
out
it
was
a
gift
from
father
laura
explained
and
i
would
lose
it
for
anything
all
right
there
you
go
said
the
janitor
swinging
the
door
wide
for
them
i
goin
home
but
i
be
comin
back
in
a
few
minutes
to
lock
up
you
best
not
be
stayin
here
then
he
added
with
a
twinkling
backward
glance
at
them
or
it
will
be
locked
up
for
the
night
you
be
we
wo
be
more
than
a
minute
violet
assured
him
and
jubilantly
the
girls
ran
through
the
empty
echoing
hall
and
stopped
before
a
door
at
the
farther
end
it
seems
so
horribly
quiet
said
violet
looking
around
at
them
with
her
hands
on
the
door
knob
it
makes
you
feel
like
a
thief
must
be
your
guilty
conscience
said
laura
wickedly
come
on
vi
we
got
to
hurry
if
we
do
want
to
be
in
for
the
night
are
you
sure
you
left
the
book
here
laura
asked
billie
as
violet
opened
the
door
and
they
crowded
in
it
would
be
too
bad
if
it
were
gone
but
a
cry
from
laura
interrupted
her
there
it
is
she
said
running
to
a
desk
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
and
picking
up
from
an
inner
corner
a
prettily
bound
book
just
the
very
place
i
left
it
too
my
but
i
glad
to
get
it
back
again
what
do
you
think
you
doing
billie
bradley
inquired
laura
a
minute
later
for
billie
had
seated
herself
at
the
teacher
desk
and
was
looking
as
severe
as
she
knew
how
take
your
seats
she
now
commanded
rapping
vigorously
on
the
desk
and
fixing
them
with
her
best
stare
violet
farrington
go
to
the
board
but
she
got
no
further
for
with
an
indignant
cry
the
girls
had
rushed
on
her
dropping
both
her
air
of
command
and
her
dignity
billie
scurried
wildly
around
the
room
keeping
the
desks
between
her
and
her
pursuers
you
ca
catch
me
you
ca
catch
me
she
taunted
them
as
she
dodged
nimbly
in
and
out
among
the
desks
i
could
keep
this
up
all
day
i
could
oh
you
could
could
you
cried
laura
and
making
a
desperate
lunge
she
almost
had
her
hand
on
billie
dress
we
see
about
that
billie
what
are
you
doing
for
billie
had
suddenly
doubled
on
her
tracks
rushed
to
the
back
of
the
room
put
her
foot
upon
a
steam
radiator
pipe
and
was
trying
to
clamber
to
the
top
of
a
bookcase
it
was
a
tall
bookcase
and
on
the
top
of
it
stood
a
marble
statue
billie
look
out
screamed
violet
as
the
bookcase
shook
and
the
statue
seemed
about
to
topple
over
by
reason
of
billie
wild
scrambling
you
wo
catch
me
this
time
billie
was
defying
them
when
the
awful
thing
happened
the
marble
statue
toppled
once
more
trembled
as
though
it
were
not
quite
sure
whether
to
fall
or
stay
where
it
was
then
came
tumbling
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
the
girls
cried
out
and
then
stood
dumbly
looking
at
the
pieces
chapter
ii
that
hundred
dollars
billie
bradley
clambered
down
from
her
perch
in
awed
silence
girls
she
said
her
voice
very
low
and
solemn
that
reading
a
book
statue
was
worth
a
hundred
dollars
the
girls
started
and
laura
cried
out
how
do
you
know
it
cost
that
much
i
heard
miss
beggs
say
so
billie
replied
dully
now
i
certainly
have
done
it
girls
what
shall
i
do
it
it
could
be
put
together
again
could
it
suggested
violet
weakly
leaning
down
to
examine
the
pieces
of
course
it
could
sniffed
laura
adding
suddenly
i
suppose
we
could
run
away
and
nobody
would
know
the
dif
look
cried
billie
excitedly
pointing
to
one
of
the
windows
following
the
direction
of
her
glance
the
girls
were
just
in
time
to
see
the
freckled
face
and
mean
little
eyes
of
amanda
peabody
disappear
from
the
window
oh
that
sneak
cried
laura
in
a
rage
rushing
across
to
the
window
while
the
other
girls
followed
close
at
her
heels
i
wish
i
were
a
boy
and
she
were
another
one
i
just
show
her
well
now
she
will
tell
and
we
could
run
away
even
if
we
wanted
to
said
billie
sinking
down
on
a
bench
and
looking
at
them
wistfully
of
course
we
would
really
have
wanted
to
she
added
after
a
minute
of
uncomfortable
silence
only
it
makes
me
mad
to
to
do
the
right
thing
oh
i
do
see
why
somebody
does
run
that
amanda
person
out
of
town
she
went
on
doubling
up
her
fists
and
looking
as
if
it
might
have
been
just
as
well
for
that
amanda
person
that
she
was
not
there
at
the
minute
teddy
says
he
calls
her
said
violet
with
a
flash
of
humor
because
it
her
goat
sounds
just
like
ted
said
billie
with
a
smile
then
her
face
sobered
again
as
she
realized
the
gravity
of
the
situation
of
course
i
have
to
make
it
good
she
said
going
over
to
the
pieces
again
and
regarding
them
mournfully
but
how
in
the
world
am
i
ever
going
to
get
together
a
hundred
dollars
it
might
just
as
well
be
a
thousand
as
far
as
i
concerned
the
last
was
a
wail
wo
your
father
give
you
the
money
asked
laura
for
to
father
a
hundred
dollars
was
only
a
drop
in
the
bucket
but
billie
only
shook
her
head
while
her
face
became
still
more
grave
he
would
if
he
could
she
said
but
i
heard
him
say
only
the
other
day
that
times
are
hard
and
everything
is
terribly
expensive
and
i
know
he
is
worried
oh
girls
i
in
a
terrible
fix
i
know
you
are
honey
said
violet
coming
over
and
putting
a
comforting
arm
about
her
but
there
must
be
some
way
that
we
can
fix
things
all
right
i
like
to
know
how
grumbled
laura
who
had
chosen
to
take
the
gloomy
view
we
might
she
added
generously
after
a
moment
thought
say
that
i
broke
it
laura
dear
cried
billie
not
quite
sure
whether
to
be
offended
or
grateful
for
the
generous
suggestion
it
wonderful
of
you
of
course
but
you
know
i
could
do
that
and
there
amanda
peabody
added
violet
she
would
let
us
get
away
with
anything
like
that
at
which
laura
nodded
again
still
more
gloomily
well
cried
billie
straightening
up
suddenly
and
trying
to
look
hopeful
i
suppose
it
wo
do
any
good
to
stand
here
and
look
at
the
pieces
besides
she
added
with
a
start
we
been
here
a
terribly
long
time
and
we
do
want
the
janitor
to
lock
us
in
they
started
for
the
door
on
the
run
but
billie
suddenly
turned
ran
back
and
began
gathering
up
the
pieces
of
the
broken
statue
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
violet
regarding
her
curiously
what
does
it
look
as
if
i
were
doing
asked
billie
reaching
for
an
old
newspaper
that
lay
in
the
forgotten
paper
basket
i
might
as
well
have
the
evidence
of
my
crime
anyway
i
want
to
take
them
to
miss
beggs
do
you
know
where
she
lives
asked
laura
stooping
and
helping
billie
at
her
task
she
sent
me
there
one
time
to
get
some
papers
billie
explained
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
clutching
the
newspaper
package
it
a
boarding
house
on
main
street
only
a
few
blocks
from
here
shall
we
go
there
now
asked
violet
as
they
closed
the
door
softly
behind
them
and
started
down
the
hall
we
might
as
well
answered
billie
with
a
sigh
the
sooner
i
get
it
over
with
the
better
i
feel
but
oh
that
hundred
dollars
never
mind
we
get
it
if
we
have
to
steal
it
said
laura
firmly
as
they
came
out
into
the
air
that
would
be
like
jumping
from
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
remarked
violet
at
which
the
girls
had
to
laugh
as
they
swung
out
through
the
gate
they
met
heegan
coming
in
and
he
smiled
at
them
from
under
his
bushy
brows
did
you
get
what
you
were
after
comin
for
he
asked
them
yes
and
something
we
did
come
for
answered
billie
while
the
color
flooded
her
face
and
she
felt
like
a
criminal
she
smiled
a
wry
little
smile
and
displayed
the
newspaper
package
meanin
heegan
began
puzzled
i
i
broke
a
statue
that
was
on
the
bookcase
explained
billie
we
were
skylarking
and
many
the
time
i
done
the
same
in
my
day
said
heegan
with
a
nod
looking
not
nearly
as
shocked
as
the
girls
thought
he
would
and
sure
what
are
you
made
young
for
if
it
was
that
you
was
meant
to
be
skylarkin
all
the
time
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
this
strange
sentiment
had
never
occurred
to
them
before
but
they
found
it
very
comforting
nevertheless
but
but
stammered
billie
this
statue
cost
a
hundred
dollars
and
it
was
given
to
miss
beggs
by
a
rich
uncle
well
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
any
one
who
would
spend
a
hundred
dollars
on
a
statue
said
heegan
deserves
to
have
it
broken
on
him
and
having
delivered
himself
of
this
surprising
comment
the
janitor
saluted
and
ambled
off
into
the
school
yard
leaving
the
girls
to
look
after
him
with
laughing
eyes
you
know
i
just
love
irishmen
remarked
billie
with
emphasis
as
they
started
on
their
way
once
more
in
thoughtful
silence
they
walked
the
remaining
three
blocks
to
the
boarding
house
where
miss
beggs
lived
this
is
it
said
billie
as
she
came
to
a
stop
before
a
brick
building
that
had
all
the
respectable
and
uncomfortable
appearance
of
a
typical
boarding
house
just
like
miss
beggs
billie
was
conscious
of
thinking
well
let
go
up
urged
laura
as
billie
showed
no
inclination
to
move
we
might
as
well
get
the
agony
over
with
all
right
come
on
cried
billie
running
ahead
of
them
and
taking
two
steps
at
a
time
as
dad
says
coward
dies
a
thousand
deaths
the
brave
man
only
one
the
end
of
this
quotation
brought
them
to
the
porch
and
billie
looked
for
the
bell
now
then
she
said
and
braced
herself
for
the
ordeal
a
stout
person
without
any
of
the
outward
characteristics
that
are
so
often
bestowed
upon
landladies
in
general
opened
the
door
and
looked
at
them
inquiringly
is
there
some
one
you
wish
to
see
she
asked
them
yes
replied
billie
in
a
weak
little
voice
i
would
like
to
see
miss
miss
beggs
if
she
is
at
home
she
is
said
the
person
she
went
away
for
the
summer
two
days
ago
did
she
leave
any
address
billie
managed
to
ask
no
she
did
but
i
guess
i
could
find
out
from
one
of
the
other
ladies
who
is
a
friend
of
hers
the
woman
volunteered
obligingly
that
is
if
it
very
particular
she
added
oh
yes
it
is
said
billie
earnestly
i
would
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
could
get
me
her
address
well
i
ca
just
now
because
the
lady
that
knows
it
is
at
home
but
if
you
leave
me
your
address
i
send
it
to
you
as
soon
i
find
it
out
have
you
paper
and
pencil
the
girls
had
not
wait
then
and
i
get
something
on
which
to
write
your
address
the
landlady
went
inside
closing
the
door
after
her
and
in
spite
of
herself
billie
uttered
a
little
sigh
of
relief
she
felt
very
much
like
a
reprieved
criminal
a
moment
later
the
woman
reappeared
with
a
pencil
and
paper
and
painstakingly
wrote
down
the
address
billie
gave
her
thank
you
so
much
said
the
latter
as
she
turned
away
you
forget
to
send
it
just
the
first
minute
you
can
will
you
the
woman
nodded
and
closed
the
door
with
a
little
bang
i
wonder
why
she
did
ask
us
in
said
laura
as
they
ran
down
the
steps
it
was
queer
to
keep
us
waiting
outside
yes
it
makes
you
feel
like
a
book
agent
chuckled
billie
but
oh
girls
she
added
i
did
know
how
much
i
dreaded
facing
miss
beggs
till
i
found
out
i
did
have
to
i
do
mind
writing
to
her
nearly
so
much
with
somewhat
lighter
steps
and
lighter
hearts
they
turned
toward
home
but
billie
could
not
get
the
statue
which
she
had
broken
out
of
her
mind
i
feel
said
laura
as
they
were
turning
the
corner
into
her
own
street
as
if
i
ought
to
pay
for
that
horrid
old
statue
billie
what
do
you
mean
queried
billie
while
violet
regarded
her
with
wide
open
eyes
well
if
it
had
been
for
me
and
my
old
book
she
explained
we
would
have
gone
back
to
school
and
then
you
would
have
gotten
yourself
into
all
that
trouble
i
really
do
feel
guilty
she
added
earnestly
i
wish
you
would
at
least
let
me
help
you
pay
for
it
billie
billie
put
an
arm
about
the
girl
and
squeezed
her
lovingly
and
i
suppose
you
to
blame
for
my
climbing
the
bookcase
too
she
chided
her
fondly
no
laura
dear
it
all
my
fault
and
you
ca
make
me
put
the
blame
on
any
one
else
but
oh
she
wailed
how
in
the
world
am
i
ever
going
to
raise
that
hundred
dollars
chapter
iii
chet
helps
the
sun
was
flooding
billie
bradley
room
when
she
awoke
the
next
morning
and
she
sat
up
in
bed
with
the
feeling
that
it
must
be
very
late
she
glanced
at
the
little
clock
on
the
dresser
and
saw
that
its
hands
pointed
to
half
past
eight
oh
i
be
late
to
school
was
her
first
thought
then
she
checked
herself
and
laughed
school
she
said
stretching
her
arms
above
her
head
with
a
delicious
sense
of
freedom
as
the
old
man
said
ai
no
sech
animile
i
guess
i
might
just
as
well
get
up
though
for
i
feel
as
if
i
were
starving
to
death
she
was
just
putting
her
feet
into
very
pretty
bedroom
slippers
when
she
remembered
the
tragedy
or
so
it
seemed
to
her
of
the
day
before
the
long
night
rest
had
driven
from
her
mind
all
thoughts
of
the
statue
was
it
really
only
yesterday
that
she
had
broken
it
the
thing
seemed
to
have
been
on
her
conscience
forever
reading
a
book
she
said
disdainfully
as
she
began
to
brush
her
hair
vigorously
horrid
old
thing
i
suppose
she
was
a
grind
anyway
like
amanda
peabody
the
thought
of
amanda
did
not
serve
to
lift
her
spirits
any
and
it
was
in
a
rather
gloomy
mood
that
she
finally
descended
to
the
breakfast
table
to
make
things
worse
she
found
that
all
the
rest
of
her
family
including
chet
had
breakfasted
bright
and
early
which
meant
that
she
would
have
to
eat
her
breakfast
in
lonely
state
the
room
was
cheerful
with
sunlight
for
bradley
had
often
said
that
a
bright
had
more
to
do
with
making
a
happy
home
than
any
other
one
thing
but
this
morning
billie
did
not
even
notice
it
she
opened
the
swinging
door
to
the
kitchen
and
peeped
in
cautiously
to
see
whether
debbie
their
black
and
much
pampered
cook
was
in
a
good
enough
mood
to
cook
her
some
breakfast
a
cheerful
aroma
greeted
her
and
she
sniffed
at
it
longingly
bacon
and
eggs
and
was
it
corn
bread
that
debbie
was
just
taking
out
of
the
oven
oh
debbie
give
me
something
to
eat
quick
she
cried
i
starving
debbie
turned
and
favored
her
with
a
large
black
stare
dem
dat
gets
up
at
nine
in
de
she
declared
done
deserves
to
go
hungry
miss
billie
beggin
your
pardon
her
tone
matched
the
severity
of
her
gaze
oh
but
debbie
said
billie
using
the
coaxing
tone
that
even
black
deborah
tyrant
of
the
household
could
never
quite
resist
remember
how
many
mornings
i
have
had
to
get
up
at
seven
and
go
out
in
the
drizzling
rain
and
all
right
honey
all
right
said
deborah
her
heart
touched
by
this
reference
to
the
hardships
her
young
mistress
had
suffered
you
go
in
room
an
do
bother
debbie
an
she
bring
you
in
the
prettiest
breakfast
you
ever
did
see
somewhat
cheered
by
this
promise
billie
retreated
into
the
and
going
over
to
a
window
under
which
flowers
bloomed
gayly
in
boxes
looked
out
at
the
pretty
view
from
where
she
stood
she
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
tennis
court
on
which
she
could
see
that
a
warm
set
of
singles
was
in
progress
one
of
the
players
was
chet
and
as
she
watched
she
saw
him
fling
his
racket
high
in
the
air
my
set
tom
he
cried
that
puts
us
even
play
you
the
rubber
this
afternoon
so
long
and
with
his
tennis
balls
in
his
hand
and
his
racket
under
his
arm
he
sauntered
over
toward
home
dear
old
chet
murmured
billie
fondly
then
came
the
thought
of
that
hundred
dollars
she
must
get
some
way
or
other
and
suddenly
there
flashed
into
her
mind
a
little
ray
of
hope
maybe
chet
could
help
she
thought
and
then
laughed
at
herself
for
thinking
it
chet
had
just
about
as
much
chance
of
getting
that
hundred
dollars
as
she
had
herself
at
that
moment
debbie
came
in
with
her
fruit
and
cereal
and
she
turned
from
the
window
with
a
sigh
i
might
as
well
eat
she
thought
resignedly
for
if
i
starve
myself
to
death
or
die
of
worry
there
wo
be
anybody
left
to
pay
for
that
old
book
worm
then
her
irrepressible
imp
of
mischief
reasserted
itself
and
she
laughed
hello
look
at
the
grand
lady
a
fresh
young
voice
called
to
her
from
the
doorway
she
turned
with
a
spoon
half
way
to
her
mouth
to
see
her
brother
laughing
at
her
what
was
that
you
called
me
she
asked
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
thoughts
had
been
so
far
away
that
she
actually
had
not
heard
what
he
said
say
what
the
matter
asked
chet
flinging
his
tennis
racket
into
one
chair
and
seating
himself
on
the
arm
of
another
are
you
sick
yes
or
if
i
not
i
ought
to
be
replied
billie
ruefully
at
which
peculiar
remark
chet
looked
still
more
amazed
now
what
particular
thing
is
worrying
you
he
asked
in
an
argumentative
tone
leaning
toward
her
come
up
billie
what
have
you
been
doing
when
my
back
was
turned
robbing
a
bank
oh
much
worse
than
that
cried
billie
unexpectedly
and
her
face
began
to
take
on
an
expression
of
alarm
worse
he
queried
there
only
about
one
thing
worse
and
that
murder
oh
chet
that
just
what
i
did
she
cried
her
imp
of
mischief
uppermost
i
murdered
a
reading
a
book
well
said
chet
taking
this
startling
bit
of
information
more
calmly
than
would
have
been
thought
possible
you
do
seem
very
much
worried
about
it
oh
but
chet
i
am
once
more
the
cloud
banished
the
merry
gleam
in
billie
eyes
wait
till
i
show
you
she
left
her
breakfast
ran
upstairs
and
was
back
in
a
minute
with
the
newspaper
parcel
here
she
is
she
cried
displaying
the
contents
tragically
chet
fingered
one
or
two
of
the
broken
bits
then
he
looked
at
her
curiously
go
on
up
he
commanded
tell
yours
truly
all
about
it
this
billie
did
in
the
fewest
words
possible
and
then
sat
down
to
the
bacon
and
eggs
that
debbie
had
placed
temptingly
on
the
table
and
cornbread
debbie
cornbread
was
a
masterpiece
when
billie
had
finished
chet
looked
grave
well
he
said
fingering
the
pieces
thoughtfully
it
does
seem
as
if
the
only
square
thing
to
do
would
be
to
replace
it
oh
i
must
chet
i
must
she
interrupted
earnestly
but
how
he
asked
a
hundred
dollars
is
a
lot
of
money
i
know
agreed
billie
miserably
i
do
think
dad
will
be
able
to
make
it
good
just
now
went
on
chet
in
that
sober
tone
that
made
people
in
north
bend
feel
confidence
in
chetwood
bradley
young
as
he
yet
was
i
heard
him
say
the
other
day
that
all
his
capital
was
tied
up
and
then
it
costs
so
much
to
live
oh
i
know
all
that
broke
in
billie
desperately
then
added
looking
up
at
her
brother
appealingly
chet
dear
i
got
to
find
the
money
to
replace
that
statue
some
way
wo
you
help
me
you
bet
your
life
i
will
cried
chet
with
a
hearty
boyishness
that
made
billie
eyes
glow
i
do
everything
i
can
sis
i
tell
you
he
paused
as
a
thought
struck
him
oh
what
she
cried
grasping
his
arm
as
he
started
from
the
room
oh
chet
tell
me
i
show
you
in
a
minute
he
promised
and
was
off
up
the
stairs
taking
them
three
at
a
time
judging
from
the
noise
he
made
in
what
seemed
to
billie
no
time
at
all
he
was
back
again
holding
something
in
his
hand
that
jingled
here
a
dollar
and
fifteen
cents
he
said
holding
out
to
her
all
his
available
wealth
i
almost
forgot
i
had
it
you
can
use
it
to
start
the
fund
oh
chet
billie
eyes
were
wet
and
she
hugged
him
fondly
you
the
very
darlingest
brother
i
ever
had
and
the
one
chet
was
beginning
when
billie
interrupted
him
by
breaking
away
and
putting
a
finger
to
her
forehead
let
me
think
impossible
he
cried
in
a
deep
voice
chet
she
said
speaking
quickly
i
have
cents
myself
and
that
with
your
dollar
dollar
fifteen
chet
corrected
gravely
will
make
quite
a
respectable
start
to
our
fund
and
she
was
off
up
the
stairs
in
her
turn
making
almost
as
much
noise
as
chet
had
done
in
a
moment
she
was
back
again
with
the
precious
cents
and
a
small
tin
box
here
the
bank
she
cried
gayly
it
will
be
real
fun
filling
it
up
yes
but
where
are
we
going
to
get
the
money
to
fill
it
up
with
chet
reminded
her
and
her
bright
face
fell
again
oh
we
find
a
way
she
said
with
a
confidence
she
was
far
from
feeling
maybe
dad
will
help
a
little
have
you
told
him
about
it
asked
chet
no
but
i
will
she
said
with
a
little
sinking
feeling
i
hate
to
tell
him
awfully
but
i
suppose
i
have
to
well
do
worry
anyway
said
chet
patting
her
shoulder
reassuringly
you
know
dad
says
worry
is
a
waste
of
time
because
everything
will
all
be
the
same
a
hundred
years
from
now
but
billie
shake
of
the
head
was
very
doubtful
i
do
see
how
that
helps
me
any
she
said
chapter
iv
the
last
hope
that
afternoon
billie
took
herself
and
a
book
out
on
the
porch
and
tried
hard
but
unsuccessfully
to
forget
her
troubles
the
more
she
tried
to
fix
her
attention
on
the
printed
page
before
her
the
more
the
broken
statue
rose
before
her
eyes
until
at
last
she
closed
the
book
with
a
slam
and
bounced
impatiently
in
her
seat
that
horrid
old
reading
a
book
has
spoiled
my
whole
summer
for
me
she
said
her
lips
pouting
rebelliously
i
wish
i
had
gone
back
to
the
old
school
anyway
i
might
have
known
it
would
bring
me
bad
luck
oh
here
comes
laura
and
her
face
brightened
as
she
saw
the
familiar
figure
of
her
chum
swinging
up
the
street
i
wonder
what
she
wants
whatever
it
is
she
seems
to
be
in
a
terrible
hurry
about
it
hello
what
the
rush
she
sang
out
as
laura
jordon
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
it
it
that
that
nanny
goat
amanda
peabody
cried
laura
panting
a
little
for
she
had
indeed
been
in
a
hurry
what
do
you
think
the
old
sneak
has
been
up
to
now
what
queried
billie
as
she
moved
over
to
make
room
for
her
chum
in
the
seat
beside
her
telling
tales
again
how
did
you
guess
it
cried
laura
her
face
flushing
with
indignation
and
about
you
billie
oh
i
could
have
killed
her
well
we
expected
it
did
we
billie
asked
in
a
tone
we
knew
when
we
saw
her
looking
in
at
the
window
that
that
was
exactly
what
she
would
do
well
i
know
but
she
went
to
the
janitor
about
it
and
laura
looked
as
if
that
in
some
way
magnified
the
offense
well
there
was
any
one
else
to
go
to
remarked
billie
reasonably
goodness
are
you
even
mad
about
it
asked
laura
her
blue
eyes
snapping
not
particularly
replied
billie
for
she
was
beginning
to
be
terribly
tired
of
the
whole
subject
how
she
hated
that
imbecile
girl
reading
a
book
and
amanda
peabody
and
and
everybody
i
got
all
over
being
angry
with
amanda
peabody
long
ago
she
said
in
answer
to
laura
incredulous
look
if
i
should
get
that
way
every
time
she
did
anything
i
never
live
to
grow
up
in
spite
of
her
indignation
laura
chuckled
i
never
did
think
of
it
in
that
way
she
admitted
adding
after
a
minute
thought
billie
dear
have
you
thought
of
some
way
you
might
pay
for
the
statue
i
did
sleep
a
wink
last
night
for
thinking
of
it
neither
did
i
said
billie
gloomily
forgetting
that
she
had
in
reality
slept
very
soundly
chet
and
i
have
started
a
fund
with
a
dollar
fifteen
of
his
and
cents
of
mine
that
as
far
as
we
have
got
so
far
i
did
think
of
uncle
bill
she
added
slowly
mentioning
a
great
uncle
who
occasionally
visited
them
great
uncle
bill
repeated
laura
pricking
up
her
ears
the
uncle
who
used
to
trot
you
on
his
knee
and
call
you
billie
yes
billie
nodded
uncle
bill
and
i
were
always
good
chums
and
i
think
if
i
told
him
what
a
fix
i
in
he
might
be
able
to
help
he
has
loads
of
money
too
billie
cried
her
chum
rapturously
why
did
you
think
of
that
before
why
it
the
very
thing
but
i
hate
to
ask
him
sighed
billie
not
sharing
laura
enthusiasm
in
the
least
i
never
had
to
ask
anything
of
anybody
before
well
everything
has
to
have
a
beginning
said
laura
lightly
adding
as
unconcernedly
as
she
could
i
told
teddy
about
it
last
night
you
did
cried
billie
turning
upon
her
while
the
color
flooded
her
face
laura
what
did
you
do
that
for
you
do
mind
do
you
queried
laura
i
sure
i
never
thought
of
your
not
wanting
teddy
to
know
oh
i
suppose
it
does
make
any
difference
sighed
billie
adding
plaintively
only
i
do
like
everybody
to
know
how
crazy
i
am
teddy
does
think
you
crazy
said
laura
with
a
chuckle
regarding
billie
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
in
fact
if
i
should
tell
you
what
he
does
think
of
you
oh
do
be
foolish
almost
snapped
billie
and
again
laura
chuckled
inwardly
well
you
need
be
so
cross
she
said
i
ca
help
what
teddy
does
or
thinks
here
he
comes
now
she
added
glancing
up
the
street
oh
and
i
a
perfect
fright
cried
billie
her
hands
flying
to
her
hair
hair
by
the
way
which
was
arranged
in
the
very
best
manner
to
set
off
billie
sparkling
prettiness
laura
she
turned
accusing
eyes
upon
her
chum
tell
the
truth
did
you
know
he
was
coming
no
said
laura
honestly
adding
with
a
little
chuckle
but
i
sort
of
had
an
idea
that
he
might
happen
along
if
ever
a
boy
looked
handsome
it
was
teddy
jordon
as
he
swung
up
the
street
to
billie
house
he
was
very
tall
looking
more
like
a
lad
of
eighteen
than
the
fifteen
years
he
was
his
fair
hair
waved
back
from
a
broad
forehead
and
his
merry
gray
eyes
sparkled
with
the
joy
of
living
hello
he
greeted
the
girls
as
he
took
the
porch
steps
two
at
a
time
and
seated
himself
on
the
railing
laura
has
been
telling
me
of
your
escapade
billie
bradley
and
i
come
to
find
out
what
you
mean
by
going
about
busting
busts
that
is
good
english
is
it
it
does
sound
just
right
agreed
billie
dimpling
adorably
you
speak
as
if
i
were
bust
pardon
me
busts
for
a
living
and
it
was
a
bust
but
a
whole
statue
no
part
way
things
for
me
there
nellie
bane
i
must
speak
to
her
cried
laura
and
before
either
of
the
others
realized
what
she
was
up
to
she
was
gone
leaving
them
alone
quite
naturally
teddy
came
over
and
took
the
seat
his
sister
had
vacated
i
say
billie
he
said
his
handsome
eyes
regarding
her
frankly
you
know
i
really
awfully
sorry
about
that
business
it
makes
me
mad
that
you
should
be
troubled
with
it
you
and
i
have
always
been
pretty
good
friends
have
we
he
finished
unexpectedly
surprised
billie
answered
warmly
the
very
best
of
friends
teddy
we
ought
to
be
she
added
with
a
little
laugh
we
known
each
other
pretty
nearly
forever
then
let
me
help
begged
teddy
earnestly
you
know
my
allowance
is
away
more
than
i
need
but
billie
stopped
him
shaking
her
head
decidedly
you
a
perfect
angel
teddy
to
want
to
do
it
she
said
but
i
really
could
let
you
do
you
know
i
could
i
do
see
why
grumbled
teddy
for
after
all
he
was
only
a
boy
and
just
now
a
disappointed
one
laura
says
you
set
on
replacing
the
thing
of
course
i
have
to
billie
said
and
if
you
are
going
around
getting
yourself
sick
with
worry
what
sort
of
good
time
do
you
think
the
rest
of
us
are
going
to
have
he
burst
out
indignantly
and
for
the
life
of
her
billie
could
not
help
smiling
for
a
moment
teddy
seemed
undecided
whether
to
laugh
or
be
angry
but
ended
as
he
nearly
always
did
by
laughing
but
it
really
is
very
funny
he
reminded
her
when
they
had
finished
goodness
you
do
have
to
tell
me
that
said
billie
ruefully
this
is
the
first
good
laugh
i
had
since
i
broke
the
old
thing
teddy
looked
penitent
i
sorry
he
said
adding
with
a
sudden
smile
i
glad
to
know
good
for
something
anyway
i
can
still
make
you
laugh
you
very
foolish
boy
said
billie
patting
his
hand
affectionately
as
if
that
were
all
you
were
good
for
well
if
you
feel
that
way
i
do
see
why
you
wo
let
me
replace
the
statue
said
teddy
still
nursing
his
disappointment
girls
are
funny
anyway
we
know
it
said
billie
lightly
but
we
ca
help
it
listen
teddy
and
she
leaned
toward
him
confidentially
i
still
have
one
hope
left
then
she
told
him
about
uncle
bill
and
his
fondness
for
her
and
during
the
recital
the
boy
brightened
noticeably
well
i
hope
the
old
boy
comes
up
to
the
scratch
he
commented
disrespectfully
adding
hurriedly
as
laura
said
to
nellie
bane
and
started
toward
them
and
billie
if
you
change
your
mind
about
what
i
asked
you
let
me
know
promise
billie
promised
and
a
few
minutes
later
said
to
the
brother
and
sister
and
watched
them
down
the
street
with
a
very
warm
feeling
somewhere
in
the
region
of
her
heart
is
it
great
to
have
friends
she
asked
a
robin
that
had
perched
itself
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
and
was
looking
at
her
knowingly
and
is
teddy
the
handsomest
boy
you
ever
saw
to
which
the
robin
knowing
little
rascal
that
he
was
nodded
not
once
but
twice
chet
came
up
on
the
porch
a
few
minutes
later
and
enticed
billie
out
for
a
game
of
tennis
with
him
hoping
to
get
her
mind
off
the
broken
statue
but
while
she
was
too
full
of
life
and
health
not
to
enjoy
the
swift
swinging
game
that
chet
gave
her
the
thought
of
the
girl
reading
a
book
stayed
constantly
in
the
back
of
her
mind
that
night
after
dinner
billie
broke
the
news
to
her
father
and
her
heart
sank
as
she
saw
the
harassed
look
that
came
into
his
eyes
you
say
it
cost
a
hundred
dollars
he
queried
breaking
a
silence
during
which
billie
had
felt
like
a
criminal
awaiting
sentence
now
she
nodded
unhappily
a
hundred
dollars
her
father
repeated
well
that
a
lot
to
pay
beatrice
for
just
a
few
minutes
reckless
fun
of
course
i
can
pay
it
but
that
will
mean
putting
off
some
affairs
of
more
pressing
importance
but
billie
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
with
a
little
cry
she
flew
to
him
and
pressed
her
soft
cheek
against
his
daddy
i
a
brute
to
worry
you
like
this
she
cried
penitently
please
do
worry
any
more
dear
i
find
some
way
to
replace
the
old
thing
myself
her
father
patted
her
cheek
but
the
worried
frown
still
remained
on
his
face
billie
started
to
leave
the
room
but
turned
before
she
had
reached
the
door
dad
she
said
hesitatingly
and
he
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
about
uncle
bill
she
said
he
has
always
given
me
anything
i
wanted
do
you
suppose
he
would
help
he
is
out
of
the
country
gone
on
a
business
trip
that
has
taken
him
on
an
ocean
voyage
said
her
father
he
will
be
gone
for
an
indefinite
period
i
thought
you
knew
billie
though
as
he
just
left
i
suppose
it
is
not
strange
you
had
not
heard
us
speak
of
it
and
with
that
bradley
relapsed
immediately
into
his
brown
study
billie
opened
the
door
and
closed
it
softly
behind
her
my
last
hope
she
sighed
plaintively
now
what
shall
i
do
chapter
v
worse
and
worse
two
weeks
passed
and
still
billie
bradley
had
found
no
solution
to
her
problem
the
broken
statue
seemed
as
far
from
being
paid
for
as
ever
and
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
the
summer
vacation
was
completely
spoiled
in
this
frame
of
mind
she
crushed
a
soft
straw
hat
down
over
her
brown
hair
one
day
and
set
out
to
find
her
chums
feeling
the
need
of
their
sympathy
and
how
was
she
to
know
poor
billie
that
the
news
the
girls
would
have
to
tell
her
would
serve
only
to
make
her
mood
the
blacker
as
she
neared
the
farrington
home
violet
herself
came
rushing
out
to
meet
her
looking
unusually
and
feverishly
excited
oh
billie
what
do
you
think
she
cried
encircling
billie
with
her
arm
and
fairly
dragging
her
up
on
the
porch
i
have
the
most
wonderful
news
to
tell
you
what
gasped
billie
for
the
unexpected
onslaught
had
literally
taken
her
breath
away
goodness
you
might
as
well
kill
me
as
scare
me
to
death
oh
but
billie
you
wo
mind
when
i
tell
you
cried
violet
regarding
her
friend
with
dancing
eyes
the
folks
have
decided
to
send
me
to
three
towers
hall
three
towers
was
a
boarding
school
some
distance
from
north
bend
laura
is
going
too
violet
continued
breathlessly
and
of
course
you
will
but
something
in
billie
face
stopped
her
and
she
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
oh
billie
she
cried
her
face
falling
you
never
going
to
tell
me
you
ca
go
i
guess
that
just
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
said
billie
her
fists
clasped
so
tightly
that
the
knuckles
showed
white
i
might
have
stood
some
chance
if
it
had
been
for
that
old
statue
now
i
ca
get
enough
money
to
pay
for
that
much
less
go
to
three
towers
oh
that
old
statue
cried
violet
desperately
adding
while
her
face
grew
longer
and
longer
what
fun
will
there
be
i
like
to
know
in
going
to
three
towers
if
you
ca
go
with
us
and
oh
billie
i
was
making
such
wonderful
plans
billie
had
to
turn
away
to
hide
the
tears
that
sprang
to
her
eyes
for
to
go
to
three
towers
hall
had
long
been
the
ambition
of
the
chums
and
now
it
was
doubly
hard
to
see
her
chance
snatched
away
by
an
accident
that
could
have
been
so
easily
avoided
if
only
she
had
not
been
so
foolish
violet
came
over
and
put
a
loving
arm
about
her
friend
never
mind
honey
she
said
consolingly
forgetting
her
own
disappointment
in
billie
we
find
some
way
to
get
to
three
towers
billie
smiled
a
wry
little
smile
and
made
an
effort
to
look
as
if
there
were
still
something
to
live
for
in
the
world
laura
told
me
that
you
thought
your
uncle
might
help
you
said
violet
after
an
interval
of
unhappily
trying
to
think
of
some
way
out
of
their
trouble
neither
laura
nor
i
will
stir
a
step
without
you
that
a
sure
thing
why
of
course
you
will
said
billie
stopping
the
swing
short
and
looking
at
her
chum
in
amazement
i
sure
your
folks
are
going
to
let
you
stay
at
home
from
the
school
they
decided
on
just
because
i
ca
go
with
you
although
and
her
voice
broke
a
little
it
just
wonderful
of
you
vi
to
feel
that
way
you
will
go
of
course
and
you
can
write
me
beautiful
letters
about
the
wonderful
times
you
are
having
i
wo
do
it
cried
violet
springing
to
her
feet
i
not
going
to
three
towers
without
you
and
that
settles
it
i
do
care
if
i
had
a
thousand
parents
who
that
turning
the
corner
she
interrupted
herself
to
ask
there
something
familiar
about
that
walk
why
it
ferd
stowing
said
billie
getting
to
her
feet
for
a
better
view
my
but
he
looks
happy
about
something
i
wonder
what
up
the
next
moment
ferd
stowing
one
of
the
boys
in
the
town
came
rushing
up
the
steps
like
a
whirlwind
and
it
did
not
take
the
girls
long
to
find
out
what
was
up
hooray
he
cried
flinging
his
hat
high
in
the
air
wuxtry
all
about
ferd
stowing
and
ted
jordon
for
goodness
sake
stop
bellowing
and
behave
billie
commanded
what
have
you
and
teddy
been
doing
now
plenty
but
that
nothing
to
what
we
going
to
do
crowed
ferd
exultantly
he
and
i
have
at
last
persuaded
our
reluctant
parents
to
send
us
to
the
military
school
you
know
the
one
that
is
only
a
little
over
a
mile
from
three
towers
where
you
girls
are
going
again
billie
felt
as
if
she
had
been
treated
to
a
shower
of
ice
water
teddy
and
ferd
were
going
to
boxton
military
academy
and
chet
her
darling
loyal
chet
would
not
be
able
to
go
with
them
her
own
disappointment
seemed
nothing
at
all
beside
this
new
tragedy
i
was
just
on
my
way
over
to
your
house
billie
was
conscious
that
ferd
was
addressing
her
we
have
had
a
chance
to
get
in
touch
with
chet
yet
but
the
old
boy
will
of
course
go
with
us
wo
he
it
would
be
any
fun
without
chet
almost
the
very
words
violet
had
said
to
her
thought
billie
as
she
tried
to
swallow
a
sob
and
only
succeeded
in
turning
it
into
a
funny
little
cough
he
will
wo
he
ferd
was
insisting
while
violet
watched
them
with
troubled
eyes
why
why
i
do
know
ferd
billie
stammered
trying
to
make
her
voice
sound
natural
i
do
know
one
thing
and
that
is
that
chet
is
crazy
to
go
and
will
if
he
gets
half
a
chance
then
i
guess
it
all
right
said
ferd
leaning
back
with
a
sigh
of
relief
gee
i
was
afraid
you
were
going
to
say
he
could
go
and
so
spoil
everything
say
ca
you
see
the
good
times
we
going
to
have
with
you
girls
at
three
towers
hall
and
we
fellows
such
a
little
way
off
that
we
can
see
each
other
every
once
in
a
while
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
that
it
real
yet
and
so
on
and
on
rapturously
while
billie
heart
sank
lower
and
lower
and
violet
own
warm
one
ached
for
her
friend
then
just
as
ferd
started
to
go
he
spied
chet
coming
up
the
street
and
hailed
him
joyfully
just
the
fellow
i
wanted
to
see
he
declared
fervently
come
on
up
here
old
man
and
hear
the
glad
news
billie
groaned
inwardly
and
seemed
about
to
speak
but
violet
stopped
her
with
a
hand
on
her
arm
might
as
well
get
it
over
with
she
whispered
chet
is
sure
to
hear
of
it
later
if
he
does
now
so
billie
waited
but
her
heart
ached
as
she
watched
chet
march
up
smilingly
to
hear
the
glad
news
we
going
to
boxton
military
academy
ferd
fairly
shouted
it
at
him
how
about
it
old
timer
are
you
going
with
us
or
are
you
going
to
leave
us
in
the
lurch
the
glad
tidings
staggered
chet
for
a
minute
but
he
came
on
quietly
and
perched
himself
upon
the
railing
one
foot
swinging
idly
you
said
you
were
going
to
the
military
academy
he
asked
his
voice
as
quiet
as
his
manner
but
billie
noticed
that
the
smile
was
gone
by
that
i
suppose
you
mean
you
and
teddy
and
you
added
ferd
beaming
upon
him
billie
said
you
were
crazy
to
go
chet
looked
at
billie
unhappy
face
and
tried
to
smile
crazy
to
go
he
repeated
i
say
i
am
but
but
me
no
buts
chet
my
lad
broke
in
the
impetuous
ferd
i
ask
you
anything
i
merely
stated
a
fact
i
i
give
almost
anything
i
own
to
make
it
a
fact
said
chet
his
eyes
on
the
ground
but
i
very
much
afraid
you
have
to
guess
again
old
man
guess
again
well
i
should
say
not
cried
ferd
getting
to
his
feet
indignantly
why
the
thing
ca
be
done
without
you
chet
billie
say
billie
only
said
interrupted
violet
coming
to
billie
rescue
that
chet
was
crazy
to
go
and
would
if
he
had
half
a
chance
ferd
sank
back
in
his
chair
too
dismayed
to
speak
well
of
all
say
old
man
you
got
to
go
and
he
turned
to
chet
pleadingly
what
sort
of
a
party
do
you
think
this
is
going
to
be
anyway
with
billie
at
three
towers
hall
and
you
back
here
in
north
bend
it
not
fair
not
fair
flared
billie

do
suppose
i
go
to
three
towers
and
leave
chet
here
do
you
then
you
not
going
either
cried
ferd
seeing
all
his
castles
in
the
air
coming
down
about
his
ears
with
a
crash
billie
shook
her
head
unhappily
no
i
not
going
either
she
said
chapter
vi
debbie
deserts
billy
bradley
really
tried
to
be
cheerful
in
the
days
that
followed
but
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
altogether
keep
out
the
vision
of
three
towers
hall
the
boarding
school
to
which
she
had
wanted
to
go
ever
since
well
almost
since
she
had
wanted
anything
laura
and
violet
would
go
without
her
they
would
have
to
go
even
in
spite
of
their
loyal
determination
not
to
their
parents
would
have
something
to
say
about
that
and
chet
was
in
just
as
bad
a
fix
for
boxton
military
academy
had
been
his
dream
even
as
three
towers
hall
had
been
billie
oh
if
only
they
could
all
go
what
a
wonderful
time
they
could
have
oh
well
and
and
bradley
sensing
something
of
all
this
were
very
unhappy
and
cast
about
desperately
for
some
way
to
give
their
boy
and
girl
the
advantages
that
the
others
would
have
but
money
was
very
tight
bradley
had
all
his
cash
tied
up
in
several
real
estate
transactions
so
for
a
little
while
the
bradleys
were
not
a
happy
family
although
they
tried
bravely
not
to
show
it
even
to
each
other
then
one
morning
came
a
long
businesslike
envelope
with
a
typewritten
address
that
caused
a
stir
in
the
family
circle
bradley
opened
it
with
a
puzzled
frown
between
her
brows
then
uttered
a
startled
exclamation
what
is
it
dear
asked
bradley
while
billie
and
chet
crowded
closer
to
her
chair
aunt
beatrice
powerson
is
dead
bradley
announced
with
a
look
more
of
shocked
surprise
than
of
grief
she
died
in
canada
quite
suddenly
and
this
is
from
her
attorney
asking
us
she
looked
across
at
her
husband
to
be
present
at
the
reading
of
the
will
well
well
said
bradley
slowly
poor
beatrice
powerson
dead
at
last
i
suppose
she
got
as
much
out
of
life
as
any
of
us
though
in
her
eccentric
way
it
was
strange
remarked
billie
slowly
that
i
should
have
been
speaking
of
aunt
beatrice
only
the
other
day
violet
wanted
to
know
if
she
was
wealthy
was
she
dad
asked
chet
with
interest
i
imagine
nobody
knew
his
father
answered
as
you
know
she
was
queer
and
as
tight
as
a
clam
when
it
came
to
talking
about
her
personal
affairs
the
only
thing
we
sure
of
is
that
she
had
plenty
of
money
to
travel
anywhere
she
wanted
to
and
that
saying
something
these
days
i
say
billie
cried
chet
his
eyes
shining
with
the
thought
dear
unselfish
chet
his
first
hope
even
then
was
more
for
billie
than
himself
you
are
aunt
beatrice
namesake
you
know
maybe
she
left
you
something
in
her
will
chet
his
mother
chided
gently
do
you
think
it
is
rather
heartless
to
be
counting
on
what
aunt
beatrice
has
left
when
we
have
just
heard
of
her
death
i
suppose
so
said
chet
rather
abashed
but
then
you
know
we
only
saw
her
about
once
in
every
three
years
and
then
she
was
very
friendly
are
you
really
going
mother
you
and
dad
asked
billie
for
it
seemed
impossible
to
her
that
her
father
and
mother
should
go
off
on
such
a
long
journey
and
leave
her
and
chet
behind
are
you
she
asked
again
anxiously
yes
i
suppose
we
must
said
bradley
looking
across
at
her
husband
who
answered
her
with
a
smile
i
do
see
what
else
we
can
do
he
replied
as
he
looked
at
his
young
daughter
you
can
keep
house
while
we
gone
billie
just
to
see
how
you
like
it
me
keep
house
cried
billie
dismayed
why
i
do
know
the
first
thing
about
it
that
the
best
way
to
learn
returned
her
father
while
bradley
began
to
smile
experience
is
the
very
best
teacher
you
know
that
all
right
but
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
she
will
be
learning
at
my
expense
groaned
chet
adding
as
a
horrible
thought
struck
him
billie
wo
have
to
cook
anything
will
she
of
course
not
laughed
bradley
and
chet
sighed
with
relief
debbie
will
be
here
as
usual
to
do
the
cooking
and
of
course
she
added
to
billie
putting
an
arm
about
her
and
drawing
her
close
debbie
will
help
you
with
anything
you
want
to
know
we
probably
wo
be
gone
more
than
a
week
anyway
so
it
was
arranged
and
a
couple
of
days
later
with
a
wildly
beating
heart
and
a
rueful
smile
upon
her
lips
billie
stood
with
chet
upon
the
station
platform
and
waved
to
her
father
and
mother
when
the
train
had
rounded
the
curve
and
disappeared
with
one
last
challenging
blast
of
the
whistle
billie
and
chet
turned
to
each
other
feeling
as
lost
and
forlorn
as
the
babes
in
the
wood
now
what
do
we
do
next
breathed
billie
breaking
the
silence
at
last
i
feel
helpless
chet
well
i
do
think
you
have
anything
on
me
admitted
chet
slangily
i
suppose
the
most
sensible
thing
to
do
would
be
to
go
home
and
see
how
debbie
is
getting
on
with
the
lunch
goodness
that
the
first
time
i
ever
had
to
be
reminded
that
i
was
hungry
said
billie
and
with
that
they
laughed
and
felt
more
natural
the
rest
of
that
day
went
off
beautifully
and
billie
was
beginning
to
feel
very
confident
when
suddenly
debbie
threw
a
suggestion
in
the
midst
of
her
contentment
i
hate
to
bother
you
miss
said
the
black
cook
approaching
her
mistress
the
next
morning
billie
by
the
way
was
busily
dusting
the
with
a
very
becoming
dust
cap
perched
on
top
of
her
pretty
hair
but
this
is
mah
day
out
your
day
out
gasped
billie
sitting
down
hard
on
the
chair
she
had
been
dusting
and
regarding
debbie
black
face
with
dismay
you
never
can
mean
that
you
are
going
to
desert
me
debbie
leave
me
to
do
all
the
cooking
and
and
everything
the
awful
vision
was
too
much
for
her
and
her
voice
died
down
to
a
whisper
i
sorry
miss
billie
said
debbie
gently
but
very
very
firmly
but
mah
young
man
and
me
we
has
a
mos
awful
fo
dis
an
i
could
break
it
no
much
as
i
want
to
she
added
that
last
in
the
evident
hope
of
appeasing
her
young
mistress
who
was
still
regarding
her
with
horrified
eyes
but
debbie
gasped
billie
when
she
could
find
her
voice
i
do
know
a
thing
in
the
world
about
cooking
have
you
have
you
ordered
anything
yas
indeed
debbie
assured
her
going
on
to
explain
that
the
meal
was
virtually
prepared
anyway
i
done
made
a
salad
for
you
and
chet
an
the
butter
beans
am
in
de
pan
dere
is
some
stew
too
which
all
you
has
to
do
is
to
warm
up
miss
billie
an
i
done
make
a
big
peach
pie
an
some
whipped
cream
in
de
so
i
reckons
wo
starve
to
death
she
added
with
a
broad
smile
that
showed
all
her
strong
white
teeth
back
to
the
last
molar
as
for
billie
she
could
have
hugged
the
mountainous
black
figure
in
the
relief
she
felt
why
with
the
dinner
all
prepared
like
this
it
would
be
just
a
lark
to
put
it
on
the
table
for
just
her
and
chet
alone
debbie
you
a
darling
and
i
love
you
she
cried
joyfully
but
you
know
you
really
should
have
scared
me
so
it
was
fair
for
answer
debbie
grinned
again
and
began
to
get
her
bulky
figure
up
the
stairs
preparatory
to
dressing
for
the
with
her
young
man
billie
watched
her
go
and
then
with
a
little
chuckle
resumed
her
dusting
i
like
to
see
debbie
young
man
she
mused
a
smile
twisting
the
corners
of
her
mouth
he
ought
to
be
a
giant
anyway
i
feel
sorry
for
him
if
he
is
dear
funny
old
debbie
wo
chet
and
i
have
a
picnic
and
as
she
had
predicted
they
did
have
the
time
of
their
lives
chet
refused
to
sit
in
the
in
lonely
state
and
in
masterly
fashion
invaded
the
kitchen
say
that
smells
good
billie
old
girl
and
he
sniffed
hungrily
at
the
stew
give
me
an
apron
and
i
help
oh
look
who
wants
to
help
cried
billie
finding
an
apron
nevertheless
and
tying
it
around
his
waist
so
that
he
looked
like
a
assistant
you
will
probably
only
get
under
my
feet
and
bother
me
to
death
but
i
suppose
i
have
to
humor
you
there
if
you
must
do
something
set
the
table
now
chet
did
not
want
to
set
the
table
it
took
him
too
far
from
the
appetizing
aromas
in
the
kitchen
however
he
obeyed
grumblingly
and
was
finally
rewarded
by
being
given
a
steaming
dish
of
stew
to
carry
in
chet
screamed
billie
following
him
in
and
checking
him
just
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
putting
the
hot
dish
on
the
tablecloth
put
a
protector
under
it
do
you
know
as
chet
started
and
looked
reproachfully
at
her
that
you
are
apt
to
ruin
the
table
and
almost
a
brand
new
one
at
that
well
you
need
scare
a
fellow
to
death
grumbled
chet
i
thought
i
stepped
on
the
cat
but
he
obeyed
instructions
my
but
does
everything
look
good
cried
billie
sniffing
hungrily
hurry
up
chet
take
off
your
apron
and
dish
up
the
stew
while
i
pour
the
coffee
what
do
you
know
about
that
made
the
coffee
and
it
smell
good
it
was
the
jolliest
of
meals
and
finished
up
in
royal
fashion
with
the
peach
pie
and
whipped
cream
in
a
very
gale
of
merriment
chet
and
billie
cleared
away
the
dinner
dishes
and
then
being
tired
by
the
unusual
exertion
decided
to
go
early
to
bed
for
the
first
part
of
the
night
billie
slept
soundly
but
just
as
the
clock
downstairs
was
striking
two
she
awakened
suddenly
and
lay
still
in
bed
listening
she
was
frightened
though
she
could
not
have
told
why
rigidly
she
lay
there
hardly
daring
to
breathe
chapter
vii
a
strange
burglar
what
was
it
that
had
awakened
billie
bradley
hardly
had
the
girl
asked
herself
that
question
when
she
heard
it
a
padding
stealthy
creeping
noise
that
made
her
clutch
the
bed
clothes
and
draw
them
tighter
about
her
then
in
a
panic
she
realized
that
whatever
it
was
had
started
upstairs
nearer
nearer
came
the
stealthy
padding
till
billie
realized
it
had
reached
the
landing
her
scalp
crept
and
her
hair
began
to
stand
on
end
her
door
was
the
nearest
to
the
stairs
and
she
was
all
alone
in
the
house
with
chet
swiftly
she
threw
off
the
covers
jumped
out
of
bed
and
with
her
limbs
trembling
under
her
ran
to
the
door
and
softly
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
then
she
leaned
weakly
against
the
door
and
listened
for
the
noise
but
it
had
stopped
evidently
the
burglar
if
burglar
it
was
had
paused
to
get
his
bearings
then
another
horrible
thought
struck
her
chet
was
sleeping
in
the
next
room
and
chet
door
was
unlocked
on
feet
that
seemed
too
weak
to
hold
her
she
crept
into
room
luckily
there
was
a
connecting
door
between
and
softly
turned
the
key
in
his
door
also
evidently
she
was
just
in
time
for
as
she
listened
the
stealthy
noise
began
again
and
it
was
coming
toward
the
very
door
she
had
just
locked
she
uttered
a
little
involuntary
sound
and
chet
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
start
up
he
demanded
sleepily
oh
hush
cried
billie
scurrying
to
his
bed
and
leaning
over
she
whispered
the
awful
words
there
a
burglar
in
the
house
chet
a
burglar
repeated
chet
wide
awake
by
this
time
who
says
so
do
be
foolish
did
i
hear
him
myself
cried
billie
in
a
desperate
whisper
oh
chet
he
on
the
stairs
outside
well
why
does
he
come
in
is
he
bashful
queried
chet
seeming
not
in
the
least
alarmed
billie
shook
him
impatiently
he
probably
would
have
come
in
if
i
had
locked
the
doors
she
told
him
impatiently
for
goodness
sake
chet
wake
up
and
tell
me
what
to
do
he
may
have
stolen
everything
we
own
by
this
time
hush
cried
chet
grasping
her
arm
and
in
a
tense
silence
they
listened
yes
they
could
not
be
mistaken
something
was
surely
brushing
against
the
door
thank
heaven
she
had
locked
it
thought
billie
as
she
began
to
feel
her
hair
stand
on
end
again
once
more
came
that
brushing
sound
and
then
very
distinctly
a
sniff
oh
chet
cried
billie
clutching
her
brother
arm
spasmodically
nervy
beggar
muttered
chet
if
i
had
a
gun
i
know
what
to
do
but
say
he
added
as
a
happy
thought
struck
him
there
dad
he
was
out
of
bed
and
across
the
room
before
billie
could
do
more
than
gasp
fearfully
she
followed
after
luckily
chet
had
elected
to
sleep
in
his
parents
room
during
their
absence
so
as
to
be
nearer
billie
and
he
had
happened
to
remember
the
secret
hiding
place
that
his
father
had
shown
him
not
long
before
where
he
kept
his
revolver
always
loaded
and
ready
for
action
oh
chet
do
be
careful
whispered
billie
as
chet
drew
the
thing
out
of
the
hidden
drawer
and
examined
it
i
i
think
i
more
afraid
of
that
than
i
am
of
the
chet
only
answer
was
a
grim
come
on
from
between
set
young
lips
fearfully
they
made
their
way
over
to
the
door
their
burglar
seemed
to
have
gone
on
to
some
other
room
for
they
could
hear
the
stealthy
padding
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
but
now
he
had
turned
in
their
direction
very
carefully
chet
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
then
while
billie
pressed
both
hands
over
her
heart
to
quiet
its
pounding
chet
flung
open
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
hall
billie
was
right
at
his
heels
and
then
the
impossible
thing
happened
a
dark
shape
coming
slowly
toward
them
stopped
at
sight
of
them
and
uttered
a
low
bark
yes
the
sound
that
issued
from
their
supposed
burglar
was
a
very
distinct
and
friendly
canine
bark
for
a
minute
chet
and
billie
just
stared
speechlessly
then
slowly
the
revolver
in
chet
hand
dropped
to
his
side
and
he
began
to
laugh
it
was
a
weak
laugh
at
first
but
it
gradually
swelled
into
a
roar
as
he
took
in
the
full
humor
of
the
situation
and
billie
after
a
moment
during
which
she
seemed
undecided
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
presently
joined
him
a
dog
gasped
chet
when
he
could
get
his
breath
come
here
old
man
and
let
have
a
look
at
you
the
dog
that
had
caused
all
the
disturbance
came
forward
at
command
and
stood
looking
up
at
them
his
handsome
brush
waving
genially
as
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
shining
through
the
window
fell
upon
him
billie
uttered
an
exclamation
why
it
bruce
nellie
bane
collie
she
cried
how
in
the
world
did
he
ever
get
in
come
here
bruce
old
boy
and
explain
yourself
obediently
bruce
went
over
to
her
and
laid
a
cold
muzzle
in
her
hand
his
soft
eyes
looking
lovingly
into
her
face
for
billie
had
made
much
of
bruce
on
her
frequent
visits
to
nellie
bane
and
the
dog
with
the
instinct
of
his
kind
had
developed
a
great
liking
for
her
though
the
first
in
his
loyal
dog
heart
was
nellie
bane
his
mistress
you
a
great
one
chet
scoffed
you
get
a
fellow
all
worked
up
to
catch
a
burglar
and
then
you
produce
a
dog
i
think
you
did
it
on
purpose
yes
and
i
suppose
i
scared
myself
half
to
death
on
purpose
too
said
billie
sarcastically
as
she
patted
the
dog
great
head
where
are
you
going
she
asked
as
chet
started
back
into
his
room
to
put
this
thing
where
i
got
it
he
explained
holding
up
the
pistol
from
which
billie
shrank
back
do
imagine
we
have
any
further
need
of
it
wait
a
minute
ordered
billie
and
chet
turned
back
surprised
we
have
found
out
yet
how
bruce
got
in
she
explained
looking
fearfully
over
her
shoulder
for
the
effects
of
her
fright
had
not
quite
left
her
yet
do
you
think
we
better
take
that
along
while
we
look
through
the
house
we
must
have
left
a
door
or
a
window
open
somewhere
bruce
could
have
come
through
the
wall
you
know
something
i
do
know
what
it
can
be
makes
me
agree
with
you
returned
chet
sarcastically
but
he
turned
to
the
stairs
nevertheless
come
on
he
said
if
we
have
left
a
window
open
it
is
high
time
that
that
window
was
shut
go
ahead
bruce
and
show
us
where
you
got
in
that
a
good
old
boy
at
the
best
it
was
rather
an
eerie
business
searching
through
the
empty
house
at
that
time
of
night
and
it
was
especially
for
billie
after
the
fright
she
had
had
and
then
they
found
it
the
french
window
that
opened
from
the
upon
the
porch
was
swinging
wide
open
a
wonderful
invitation
to
enter
for
any
sneak
thief
who
might
happen
to
pass
that
way
billie
shivered
again
as
chet
with
a
final
pat
put
bruce
outside
and
closed
and
locked
the
window
there
i
guess
we
wo
have
any
more
visitors
he
said
as
they
started
through
the
dark
to
the
stairs
let
hope
not
returned
billie
fervently
when
they
reached
their
rooms
upstairs
they
felt
too
excited
for
sleep
and
sat
for
a
long
time
talking
over
the
incident
they
could
laugh
now
at
their
surprise
in
meeting
friendly
bruce
instead
of
a
very
unfriendly
but
more
than
once
both
of
them
caught
themselves
listening
for
sounds
in
the
silent
house
below
it
was
just
luck
said
billie
as
she
rose
at
last
to
go
to
bed
that
it
was
bruce
that
happened
to
find
that
open
window
instead
of
of
some
one
else
chapter
viii
startling
developments
chet
and
billie
were
very
careful
to
leave
neither
doors
nor
windows
unlocked
and
the
rest
of
the
week
passed
without
further
mishap
then
one
morning
came
a
telegram
from
their
parents
saying
that
they
would
be
home
the
next
day
goodness
now
i
have
to
get
busy
cried
billie
jumping
up
from
the
table
in
such
a
hurry
that
she
very
nearly
upset
chet
coffee
cup
thereby
considerably
surprising
that
boy
say
do
you
think
it
catching
he
asked
with
a
smile
what
the
matter
with
you
billie
oh
of
course
you
would
understand
you
a
boy
remarked
his
sister
condescendingly
as
she
put
on
the
becoming
dust
cap
and
pulled
some
gloves
on
her
hands
do
you
see
she
added
as
chet
continued
to
stare
at
her
that
this
house
has
to
be
immaculate
before
mother
gets
back
i
simply
got
to
live
up
to
my
reputation
never
knew
you
had
one
remarked
chet
cruelly
as
he
turned
back
to
his
bacon
and
eggs
with
a
relieved
sigh
if
you
need
any
help
he
offered
graciously
as
billie
swept
out
of
the
room
just
call
on
me
thank
you
i
do
called
back
billie
making
a
face
at
him
over
her
shoulder
and
then
followed
such
a
whirlwind
of
sweeping
and
dusting
and
throwing
about
of
furniture
that
poor
chet
was
dismayed
and
was
forced
to
take
refuge
on
the
porch
however
when
billie
flushed
and
breathless
and
very
very
pretty
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
about
to
admire
her
handiwork
he
told
her
that
she
was
some
wonder
now
how
about
lunch
he
asked
and
billie
appetite
sharpened
by
work
enthusiastically
agreed
it
seemed
an
eternity
to
wait
until
the
next
morning
but
somehow
the
time
came
at
last
finding
brother
and
sister
on
with
excitement
long
before
it
was
time
to
go
to
meet
the
train
they
were
ready
and
waiting
billie
was
swinging
back
and
forth
in
the
porch
swing
grasping
a
cushion
in
each
hand
to
keep
her
from
jumping
out
while
chet
walked
restlessly
up
and
down
if
you
do
sit
down
said
billie
so
suddenly
that
her
brother
jumped
i
just
scream
well
go
ahead
if
it
will
make
you
feel
any
better
invited
chet
amiably
however
for
the
sake
of
peace
he
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
broad
armed
chairs
is
it
train
time
yet
asked
billie
as
she
had
asked
many
times
during
the
last
fifteen
minutes
here
said
chet
handing
over
his
watch
take
this
and
keep
looking
at
it
my
voice
is
getting
hoarse
saying
but
i
do
see
why
we
ca
go
down
to
the
station
anyway
argued
billie
only
that
it
about
a
hundred
times
more
comfortable
to
wait
here
but
we
might
miss
the
train
wailed
billie
and
chet
jumped
to
his
feet
with
a
chuckle
oh
come
on
he
cried
we
missed
the
train
several
times
according
to
you
in
a
minute
you
will
almost
have
me
worried
you
a
dear
old
bear
said
billie
snuggling
her
arm
into
his
as
they
set
off
you
certainly
do
have
a
way
with
you
billie
that
gets
you
what
you
want
he
admitted
adding
meaningly
besides
i
thinking
i
better
keep
on
the
right
side
of
you
just
now
why
asked
billie
puzzled
in
case
aunt
beatrice
left
you
something
you
were
her
namesake
remember
billie
glanced
up
at
him
an
eager
look
in
her
eyes
but
her
glance
fell
again
and
she
shook
his
arm
severely
what
the
use
of
raising
hopes
she
said
dolefully
as
a
vision
of
the
broken
girl
reading
a
book
rose
reproachfully
before
her
and
she
thought
longingly
of
how
happy
she
could
be
if
it
were
only
possible
to
replace
it
and
there
was
three
towers
hall
but
she
shook
off
the
thought
and
had
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
when
the
sharp
blast
of
an
engine
whistle
made
them
jump
chet
she
gasped
it
the
train
we
must
miss
it
we
can
make
it
if
we
run
said
chet
as
he
took
hold
of
her
arm
come
on
no
not
that
way
the
short
cut
that
the
idea
warm
and
panting
they
came
out
upon
the
station
platform
just
as
the
train
drew
in
they
watched
the
passengers
eagerly
but
not
at
first
seeing
those
they
sought
had
almost
decided
that
they
were
coming
on
a
later
train
when
away
down
at
the
end
of
the
platform
billie
espied
a
familiar
hat
there
they
are
mother
she
cried
as
they
came
within
hailing
distance
we
thought
you
were
on
the
train
oh
what
a
fright
we
had
after
the
greetings
were
over
chet
and
billie
both
noticed
that
their
parents
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
and
both
of
them
wondered
however
they
had
too
much
to
talk
about
just
then
to
do
much
wondering
about
anything
and
they
walked
slowly
toward
home
asking
and
answering
a
very
flood
of
questions
bradley
wanted
to
know
how
billie
had
got
along
without
her
at
which
both
chet
and
billie
tried
to
tell
the
story
of
nellie
collie
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
breath
when
they
had
finished
bradley
chuckled
but
bradley
looked
grave
it
happened
to
be
funny
she
said
but
it
might
have
been
very
serious
i
hope
you
were
careful
after
that
were
we
they
cried
and
billie
added
with
a
laugh
we
locked
and
double
locked
all
the
windows
and
doors
and
if
it
had
been
for
chet
i
would
have
piled
furniture
against
the
doors
but
we
want
to
know
what
you
been
doing
she
cried
turning
to
her
mother
eagerly
tell
us
please
quick
we
been
waiting
so
long
again
bradley
laughed
and
pinched
his
impatient
young
daughter
cheek
i
think
our
news
can
wait
till
we
get
to
the
house
he
said
but
ca
protested
billie
anybody
would
think
you
really
expected
to
hear
something
chuckled
bradley
who
seemed
to
be
enjoying
himself
immensely
over
something
oh
please
begged
billie
almost
beside
herself
with
impatience
by
this
time
and
chet
in
his
quiet
way
was
just
as
bad
there
was
something
about
their
mother
and
father
manner
that
told
them
something
was
in
the
wind
i
just
dying
by
inches
went
on
billie
but
this
time
it
was
bradley
who
interrupted
here
we
are
at
home
dear
she
said
ca
you
give
dad
and
me
a
chance
to
rest
and
give
us
perhaps
a
cup
of
tea
oh
i
a
selfish
old
beast
said
billie
penitently
i
might
have
known
you
would
be
terribly
tired
after
that
long
train
ride
and
still
scolding
herself
she
hurried
them
before
her
into
the
house
and
flew
to
find
debbie
she
had
not
far
to
go
however
for
debbie
was
just
lumbering
like
a
elephant
through
the
hall
to
greet
her
master
and
mistress
as
soon
as
the
greetings
were
over
she
lumbered
back
again
to
make
the
necessary
tea
billie
and
chet
controlled
their
impatience
answering
the
questions
their
mother
had
to
ask
them
about
all
that
had
happened
while
they
had
been
away
for
bradley
had
been
anxious
when
they
finally
left
the
table
and
bradley
led
the
way
back
into
the
library
billie
uttered
a
long
sigh
of
relief
well
said
bradley
and
they
leaned
forward
eagerly
we
found
that
what
we
always
supposed
about
the
amount
of
money
aunt
beatrice
had
was
right
she
left
only
a
few
thousand
and
that
queer
soul
that
she
was
she
left
to
a
missionary
society
oh
cried
billie
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
both
felt
and
looked
horribly
disappointed
she
had
not
known
just
how
much
she
had
hoped
both
for
herself
and
for
chet
until
this
moment
and
chet
poor
fellow
felt
just
as
bad
although
he
showed
it
less
then
she
did
leave
anything
either
to
you
or
dad
chet
asked
no
but
she
did
leave
something
to
you
and
billie
was
startling
announcement
billie
and
chet
looked
at
one
another
as
if
to
be
sure
that
they
had
heard
aright
you
say
she
left
us
something
cried
billie
breathlessly
yes
but
do
let
your
hopes
run
away
with
you
bradley
warned
them
for
it
was
very
much
oh
tell
us
the
two
commanded
eagerly
and
in
unison
she
left
a
gold
watch
to
chet
bradley
told
them
it
is
really
a
very
beautiful
watch
chet
and
worth
a
good
deal
of
money
and
to
billie
she
paused
for
emphasis
and
billie
wriggled
impatiently
and
to
billie
she
left
her
rambling
old
homestead
at
cherry
corners
a
homestead
at
cherry
corners
gasped
billie
unable
to
believe
her
ears
while
chet
looked
interested
what
sort
of
a
house
is
it
mother
i
have
been
there
for
a
number
of
years
replied
her
mother
knitting
her
brows
in
an
effort
to
recall
the
details
of
billie
queer
inheritance
as
i
remember
it
it
is
an
rambling
affair
it
must
have
been
considered
rather
handsome
in
its
palmy
years
and
it
has
been
in
the
powerson
family
for
generations
in
fact
i
believe
it
dates
back
to
revolutionary
days
it
has
great
large
rooms
and
rather
spooky
dark
hallways
i
afraid
i
was
very
much
impressed
with
it
the
first
time
i
saw
it
she
finished
with
a
smile
a
funny
thing
to
leave
me
said
billie
her
eyes
big
and
round
with
wonder
then
she
added
without
thinking
as
billie
always
did
oh
do
i
wish
she
had
left
me
a
hundred
dollars
instead
it
would
have
been
much
more
useful
chapter
ix
ghosts
and
things
billie
was
instantly
sorry
for
her
speech
as
she
saw
the
old
troubled
expression
cross
her
father
face
forgive
me
please
she
pleaded
i
think
i
must
be
the
most
ungrateful
girl
alive
well
i
should
say
so
cried
chet
to
whom
the
description
of
the
queer
old
house
while
dismaying
his
sister
had
appealed
immensely
say
like
nothing
better
than
to
go
out
right
now
and
look
your
property
over
billie
big
rooms
and
spooky
halls
and
say
mother
it
must
have
a
cellar
and
an
attic
what
are
they
like
i
suppose
said
his
mother
smiling
at
his
enthusiasm
that
since
you
seem
to
like
the
ghostly
part
you
would
be
more
than
ever
pleased
with
the
attic
and
cellar
as
i
remember
it
the
cellar
was
the
most
peculiar
part
of
the
whole
queer
place
aunt
beatrice
took
me
through
it
and
seemed
immensely
proud
of
the
funny
old
tunnels
and
that
were
tucked
away
in
all
sort
of
odd
corners
the
only
thing
i
liked
about
it
she
finished
with
a
reminiscent
smile
was
the
icy
room
where
she
kept
her
fruit
preserves
this
gets
better
and
better
fairly
crowed
chet
a
damp
gloomy
old
cellar
with
tunnels
and
storerooms
in
queer
corners
and
but
you
were
going
to
tell
us
about
the
attic
yes
the
attic
cried
billie
for
by
this
time
chet
had
made
her
as
much
interested
in
her
strange
inheritance
as
he
was
did
it
have
trunks
in
it
mother
and
cobwebs
trunks
yes
but
not
cobwebs
smiled
her
mother
for
aunt
beatrice
was
an
excellent
housekeeper
when
she
was
at
home
then
the
attic
was
spooky
queried
chet
disappointed
i
should
say
it
was
returned
his
mother
with
an
emphasis
that
set
all
his
fears
at
rest
it
was
the
creepiest
place
i
have
ever
been
in
and
i
was
never
gladder
in
my
life
than
when
we
left
it
for
the
more
cheerful
lower
floor
though
goodness
knows
that
was
dreary
enough
say
when
are
we
going
cried
chet
jumping
to
his
feet
his
face
flushed
with
eagerness
where
asked
bradley
to
cherry
corners
of
course
answered
chet
in
a
tone
which
very
plainly
meant
why
ask
such
a
foolish
question
to
the
ghosts
that
inhabit
the
garret
and
cellar
of
billie
new
house
hold
on
hold
on
there
cried
bradley
who
had
been
listening
to
the
proceedings
in
amused
silence
do
you
happen
to
know
how
far
cherry
corners
is
from
here
very
far
asked
billie
a
whole
day
ride
that
all
their
father
answered
say
dad
cried
chet
suddenly
what
do
you
suppose
the
old
place
is
worth
i
ca
say
chet
answered
bradley
being
so
far
from
good
roads
and
the
railroad
i
am
afraid
the
land
is
not
worth
much
but
it
must
be
worth
something
persisted
the
boy
bradley
smiled
faintly
for
billie
sake
let
us
hope
so
but
you
must
remember
in
this
state
there
are
thousands
of
abandoned
farms
folks
simply
ca
make
a
living
on
them
and
so
they
move
away
but
the
buildings
must
be
worth
something
to
live
in
yes
but
that
is
all
you
ca
move
an
old
stone
house
to
some
other
spot
why
do
they
call
it
corners
asked
billie
for
she
had
been
following
a
little
train
of
thought
all
her
own
it
a
very
queer
name
oh
they
come
by
it
naturally
enough
her
mother
answered
it
is
surrounded
by
a
grove
of
cherry
trees
and
is
near
a
crossing
of
two
rocky
roads
so
you
see
the
reason
for
corners
goodness
that
sounds
as
if
it
were
away
off
in
the
wilderness
cried
billie
adding
but
would
it
be
awful
to
have
to
live
in
that
spooky
old
house
all
alone
are
there
any
houses
near
it
mother
not
one
for
more
than
a
mile
said
bradley
they
are
almost
as
isolated
now
as
they
used
to
be
in
the
old
indian
days
indians
cried
chet
pricking
up
his
ears
again
did
you
say
something
about
indians
mother
why
i
heard
aunt
beatrice
say
answered
bradley
beginning
to
share
in
her
children
enthusiasm
that
the
powersons
who
originally
built
the
house
built
it
especially
for
the
purpose
of
resisting
indian
attacks
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
she
added
her
eyes
beginning
to
shine
with
excitement
that
was
the
reason
for
the
winding
tunnels
and
secret
rooms
as
the
last
resort
the
family
could
take
refuge
in
them
oh
boy
cried
chet
springing
to
his
feet
for
the
second
time
did
you
hear
that
did
you
indian
raids
and
oh
gosh
words
failed
him
and
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
with
a
sigh
of
joy
is
it
wonderful
breathed
billie
at
first
i
was
disappointed
but
now
is
that
all
she
left
mother
is
that
enough
her
father
interjected
with
a
laugh
i
suppose
so
but
i
thought
why
yes
that
was
all
said
her
mother
adding
the
next
moment
surprised
that
she
should
have
forgotten
the
most
important
part
of
all
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
aunt
beatrice
left
you
the
house
with
all
its
contents
oh
breathed
billie
again
now
i
know
we
going
to
have
a
wonderful
time
what
does
the
old
house
contain
questioned
chet
his
mind
was
on
getting
some
money
out
of
the
inheritance
for
billie
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
answered
his
mother
it
may
be
completely
furnished
or
it
may
be
quite
bare
i
imagine
though
that
aunt
beatrice
left
it
furnished
but
everything
is
very
old
and
maybe
the
rats
and
moths
have
played
sad
havoc
there
they
talked
for
a
little
while
more
about
this
strange
thing
that
had
happened
then
bradley
went
off
to
pick
up
the
loose
ends
of
his
business
and
bradley
adjourned
to
the
kitchen
to
discuss
supper
preparations
with
the
mountainous
debbie
left
alone
billie
and
chet
looked
at
each
other
wonderingly
well
said
billie
in
a
slightly
awed
tone
we
expected
something
to
happen
and
it
certainly
did
but
we
did
expect
her
to
leave
you
an
old
stone
mansion
crowed
chet
say
billie
he
added
stopping
before
her
in
his
excited
pacing
of
the
room
to
gaze
at
her
eagerly
are
you
crazy
to
go
out
and
see
it
i
like
said
billie
fervently
to
start
for
cherry
corners
on
the
very
next
train
but
i
not
so
sure
i
like
to
stay
in
that
place
after
nightfall
she
added
on
second
thought
why
you
not
afraid
of
the
ghosts
are
you
he
asked
with
intense
scorn
do
you
know
that
ghosts
are
all
in
the
imagination
of
course
i
do
who
said
i
was
afraid
of
ghosts
retorted
billie
with
spirit
you
know
that
i
do
believe
in
them
any
more
than
you
do
well
then
what
are
you
afraid
of
insisted
chet
oh
thieves
and
things
tramps
maybe
said
billie
thoughtfully
then
she
added
with
spirit
as
chet
smiled
a
superior
sort
of
smile
i
just
guess
you
would
be
able
to
spend
a
night
in
that
sort
of
a
gloomy
old
house
away
off
from
everybody
without
feeling
nervous
goodness
i
be
expecting
every
minute
to
have
the
ghosts
of
dead
and
gone
indians
rise
up
and
scalp
me
thought
you
did
believe
in
ghosts
gibed
chet
i
do
flared
billie
adding
rather
weakly
but
i
not
going
to
take
any
chances
anyway
but
oh
she
added
after
a
few
minutes
of
thoughtful
silence
i
help
it
if
it
is
ungrateful
but
i
do
wish
aunt
beatrice
had
left
me
a
few
hundred
dollars
instead
we
still
got
that
old
statue
to
worry
about
and
three
towers
hall
and
the
military
academy
chet
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
he
said
with
sudden
inspiration
there
the
watch
aunt
beatrice
left
me
you
know
mother
said
it
was
very
valuable
billie
face
lighted
for
a
moment
then
fell
again
but
you
know
uncle
bill
always
said
that
you
never
could
get
anything
like
the
value
for
old
gold
and
anyway
she
rose
and
put
a
loving
arm
about
him
i
could
let
you
do
that
for
me
chet
dear
i
think
the
dearest
brother
in
the
world
a
few
hours
later
laura
jordon
and
violet
farrington
came
over
trying
their
best
not
to
look
curious
they
had
waited
as
long
as
they
could
but
knowing
about
the
death
of
billie
queer
old
aunt
and
knowing
also
that
billie
as
her
namesake
might
expect
some
share
of
the
fortune
if
there
was
one
they
had
been
filled
with
excitement
and
now
as
they
ran
up
the
steps
to
billie
porch
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
keep
from
blurting
out
the
question
for
both
laura
and
violet
had
been
perfectly
certain
that
billie
aunt
beatrice
had
been
some
sort
of
miser
who
had
piled
up
an
immense
fortune
simply
for
their
chum
benefit
just
think
violet
had
said
in
one
of
their
excited
conferences
on
the
subject
what
a
wonderful
thing
it
will
be
for
billie
just
now
when
she
is
so
worried
about
that
miserable
old
statue
and
for
chet
too
yes
it
would
mean
they
could
both
go
to
school
and
we
all
have
such
a
good
time
laura
had
chimed
in
goodness
she
had
added
with
a
chuckle
i
feel
almost
as
much
obliged
to
aunt
beatrice
as
billie
will
but
now
that
the
great
moment
had
come
they
sat
decorously
in
porch
swing
and
tried
to
appear
not
at
all
curious
as
to
whether
billie
had
gathered
in
a
fortune
since
they
last
had
seen
her
or
not
and
billie
her
little
imp
of
mischief
at
work
again
guessed
the
object
of
their
visit
and
decided
with
an
inward
chuckle
to
keep
them
guessing
she
managed
to
accomplish
her
purpose
for
just
about
five
minutes
then
laura
unable
to
stand
the
suspense
a
moment
more
took
the
bit
in
her
teeth
and
bolted
for
goodness
sake
billie
she
cried
desperately
why
you
tell
us
tell
you
what
asked
billie
trying
to
look
innocent
have
i
been
telling
you
yes
about
the
way
debbie
makes
potato
salad
cried
laura
disgustedly
you
know
well
enough
why
we
came
why
you
came
billie
repeated
looking
still
more
surprised
why
naturally
i
thought
you
came
to
see
me
billie
bradley
if
you
do
tell
us
what
we
want
to
know
this
instant
cried
laura
jumping
to
her
feet
and
making
a
threatening
movement
toward
billie
mischievous
head
i
i
oh
i
do
know
what
i
do
are
you
going
to
be
good
are
you
yes
yes
cried
billie
pretending
immense
fright
while
her
eyes
danced
with
mischief
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
to
know
and
i
do
my
best
your
highness
this
last
in
such
a
very
humble
tone
that
laura
chuckled
all
right
go
ahead
then
she
said
while
violet
leaned
forward
eagerly
what
did
your
aunt
leave
you
straight
from
the
shoulder
billie
murmured
then
as
laura
made
another
threatening
gesture
toward
her
added
hurriedly
all
right
do
shoot
and
i
tell
you
everything
only
it
will
take
time
billie
paused
to
allow
the
proper
amount
of
emphasis
then
said
in
a
deep
whisper
she
left
me
a
haunted
house
chapter
x
old
furniture
laura
screamed
and
violet
jumped
clear
out
of
her
seat
they
stared
at
billie
and
did
you
say
asked
laura
when
she
could
get
her
breath
i
said
said
billie
speaking
very
distinctly
and
enjoying
the
sensation
she
had
caused
that
aunt
beatrice
left
me
a
haunted
house
i
was
dreaming
stammered
violet
while
laura
just
continued
to
stare
is
all
billie
is
that
enough
asked
billie
just
as
her
father
had
done
a
few
hours
before
it
either
not
enough
or
it
is
too
much
replied
violet
if
i
had
to
have
the
ghosts
i
should
want
some
very
substantial
compensations
to
make
up
for
such
housemates
as
those
airy
and
playful
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
said
to
make
but
it
is
a
house
persisted
billie
and
you
know
it
is
everybody
who
can
own
a
haunted
house
a
haunted
house
said
laura
speaking
in
a
hushed
tone
is
it
a
real
haunted
house
billie
or
are
you
fooling
well
i
do
know
that
it
is
a
regular
one
admitted
billie
reluctantly
you
see
it
is
the
house
aunt
beatrice
used
to
live
in
when
she
was
at
home
and
she
left
it
to
me
with
everything
in
it
how
perfectly
glorious
cried
laura
clapping
her
hands
with
delight
tell
us
about
it
billie
what
made
you
say
it
was
haunted
then
did
billie
tell
them
all
that
her
mother
had
told
her
about
her
inheritance
and
if
the
truth
be
told
even
added
a
few
details
of
her
own
however
that
may
have
been
the
fact
remains
that
when
she
had
finished
the
girls
were
as
perfectly
wild
as
chet
had
been
to
visit
the
queer
old
place
and
if
need
be
even
confront
its
ghosts
think
cried
laura
clasping
her
hands
rapturously
just
think
of
being
able
to
roam
all
over
that
romantic
old
place
and
pry
into
corners
and
get
your
hands
dirty
interrupted
billie
drily
why
billie
laura
stopped
in
her
transports
to
regard
her
friend
with
wide
eyes
are
you
simply
wild
about
the
place
too
oh
i
suppose
so
said
billie
adding
as
a
shadow
crossed
her
face
the
folks
think
i
awful
all
chet
and
i
suppose
i
am
but
give
the
whole
place
tunnels
spooky
hallways
ghostly
attic
and
everything
for
just
a
few
little
hundred
dollar
bills
the
girls
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
realizing
that
billie
strange
inheritance
did
not
do
a
thing
toward
solving
the
old
problems
of
the
broken
statue
and
of
going
to
boarding
school
then
violet
who
was
always
thinking
up
some
happy
way
out
of
a
difficulty
gave
a
little
bounce
in
the
swing
how
do
we
know
she
cried
as
the
girls
looked
at
her
half
hopefully
but
what
you
could
sell
some
of
the
furniture
in
the
old
house
and
get
enough
to
pay
for
the
statue
we
might
at
that
said
billie
her
face
lighting
up
again
but
mother
said
it
must
all
be
awfully
old
she
added
doubtfully
all
the
better
cried
violet
growing
more
and
more
enthusiastic
you
say
that
the
old
house
dates
back
to
revolutionary
times
billie
how
do
we
know
but
what
some
of
the
old
furniture
would
be
very
valuable
as
antiques
violet
you
a
wonder
cried
billie
hugging
her
so
hard
that
she
gasped
for
breath
i
never
have
thought
of
that
in
a
thousand
years
now
you
speak
of
it
she
added
thoughtfully
i
remember
some
antique
furniture
that
uncle
bill
has
in
his
library
he
says
it
worth
all
sorts
of
money
but
i
would
give
two
cents
for
it
well
as
long
as
somebody
will
what
should
we
care
cried
laura
flippantly
maybe
you
make
a
fortune
for
yourself
after
all
billie
oh
and
think
what
it
would
mean
cried
violet
her
eyes
shining
it
would
mean
that
you
could
pay
for
that
beastly
old
statue
billie
and
it
would
mean
that
you
could
go
to
three
towers
with
us
and
chet
could
go
to
the
military
academy
with
teddy
and
ferd
laura
added
for
goodness
sake
cried
poor
billie
wildly
you
make
me
feel
dizzy
what
is
the
use
of
getting
my
hopes
all
raised
probably
aunt
furniture
will
be
old
stuff
that
nobody
would
give
two
cents
for
goodness
what
a
wet
blanket
cried
laura
reproachfully
well
i
rather
be
a
wet
blanket
retorted
billie
desperately
than
to
plan
for
a
lot
of
fun
and
then
be
disappointed
i
i
been
disappointed
enough
goodness
knows
there
was
a
quiver
in
billie
brave
little
mouth
and
instinctively
violet
and
laura
put
an
arm
about
her
we
know
what
you
mean
said
violet
soothingly
and
if
you
do
want
us
to
we
try
not
to
hope
too
hard
or
if
we
do
we
keep
it
to
ourselves
added
laura
and
billie
hugged
them
fondly
i
do
want
you
to
stop
hoping
she
cried
plaintively
and
i
want
to
be
a
wet
blanket
either
i
just
afraid
that
all
the
girls
swung
back
and
forth
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
then
it
was
laura
who
spoke
when
are
you
going
out
to
look
over
your
property
billie
why
i
do
know
answered
billie
thoughtfully
as
soon
as
we
can
arrange
it
i
suppose
dad
says
it
a
full
day
trip
to
get
there
so
we
would
have
to
make
some
arrangement
to
stay
over
night
could
you
spend
the
night
in
the
house
suggested
violet
we
might
billie
answered
doubtfully
although
i
must
say
i
like
to
not
the
first
night
anyway
i
want
time
to
become
acquainted
with
the
place
first
if
you
will
promise
on
your
word
of
honor
not
to
laugh
at
me
said
violet
after
another
short
silence
i
tell
you
that
i
have
another
idea
we
wo
laugh
they
promised
and
billie
added
eagerly
tell
us
about
it
violet
even
if
we
do
laugh
at
your
ideas
at
first
we
generally
end
by
following
them
but
you
said
you
would
laugh
this
time
violet
reminded
her
adding
as
the
worst
threat
she
could
think
of
if
you
do
i
wo
let
you
follow
out
my
idea
all
right
said
billie
as
chet
would
say
why
i
was
just
thinking
said
violet
looking
at
them
intently
that
we
have
a
plan
in
the
world
for
spending
our
vacation
vi
cried
laura
joyfully
not
waiting
for
her
to
finish
you
a
good
idea
this
time
you
were
going
to
say
why
not
spend
our
vacation
there
at
cherry
corners
asked
billie
surprised
adding
with
a
demure
glance
nobody
seems
to
think
of
asking
me
about
it
and
it
my
property
you
know
gracious
is
she
stuck
up
cried
laura
flippantly
i
have
you
know
you
not
the
only
property
holder
in
the
community
billie
bradley
dad
gave
me
the
deed
to
three
lots
in
some
outlandish
place
i
do
even
know
where
it
is
probably
did
have
anything
else
to
do
with
them
so
wished
them
on
you
said
billie
cruelly
should
wonder
said
laura
adding
with
a
rueful
little
smile
i
never
been
able
to
find
out
whether
it
was
an
april
present
or
not
well
i
do
see
what
all
that
has
to
do
with
my
proposition
put
in
violet
patiently
now
own
up
do
you
think
it
a
great
idea
wonderful
said
billie
unenthusiastically
i
do
know
when
ever
heard
of
anything
so
brilliant
there
something
wrong
with
billie
said
violet
beginning
to
look
anxious
do
you
think
we
better
send
for
a
doctor
laura
i
think
you
are
the
one
who
needs
a
doctor
retorted
billie
who
ever
thought
of
spending
a
vacation
out
in
the
wilderness
a
million
miles
or
so
from
nowhere
in
an
old
house
that
makes
your
flesh
creep
and
the
hair
rise
on
your
head
just
to
look
at
it
my
but
that
must
feel
funny
said
laura
the
irrepressible
one
experience
i
never
did
have
what
asked
billie
have
my
hair
rise
on
my
head
please
excuse
me
billie
as
billie
in
her
turn
looked
threatening
what
was
it
you
were
about
to
say
goose
commented
billie
and
then
turned
to
violet
did
you
really
mean
that
about
spending
our
vacation
there
she
asked
of
course
i
did
said
violet
and
i
do
see
what
so
very
funny
about
it
anyway
we
could
take
a
chaperone
and
maybe
the
boys
could
come
along
too
oh
that
would
be
fun
cried
billie
then
flushed
as
she
met
laura
laughing
eyes
i
meant
she
added
angry
because
of
the
blush
that
the
place
would
be
quite
so
lonesome
and
horrid
with
the
boys
around
oh
yes
we
know
said
laura
with
an
aggravating
twinkle
that
made
billie
long
to
shake
her
we
know
all
about
it
honey
why
thought
billie
as
she
ignored
the
remark
pretending
not
to
hear
it
would
laura
always
be
such
a
goose
as
to
make
a
joke
of
the
very
real
friendship
between
her
and
teddy
jordon
she
liked
teddy
immensely
and
she
was
not
going
to
stop
liking
him
even
if
laura
would
persist
in
being
foolish
then
you
will
admit
it
is
a
good
idea
violet
asked
eagerly
i
liked
it
all
but
billie
only
likes
the
last
part
about
the
boys
said
laura
and
again
billie
had
a
wild
desire
to
shake
her
it
will
be
lots
of
fun
she
said
beginning
to
see
the
possibilities
in
a
vacation
spent
at
cherry
corners
mother
says
the
rooms
are
large
and
there
are
plenty
of
them
so
we
could
have
as
big
a
party
as
we
wanted
but
i
do
know
how
comfortable
you
would
be
she
warned
them
who
cares
about
being
comfortable
on
a
lark
like
that
cried
laura
airily
the
more
uncomfortable
we
are
the
more
fun
we
have
i
say
billie
do
you
think
we
better
take
gyp
along
gyp
was
a
thoroughbred
bull
terrier
of
which
laura
was
the
proud
owner
he
might
come
in
handy
if
any
ghosts
showed
up
the
girls
laughed
at
her
as
if
gyp
would
be
any
good
against
ghosts
scoffed
violet
why
they
would
walk
right
through
him
well
said
laura
with
a
little
chuckle
he
could
at
least
bark
and
let
us
know
when
they
were
coming
chapter
xi
billie
wins
out
but
whom
shall
we
get
for
a
chaperone
asked
laura
jordon
after
they
had
thoroughly
discussed
these
new
and
startling
plans
for
a
vacation
we
do
want
to
get
any
one
who
is
too
old
and
grouchy
and
yet
the
folks
probably
would
let
us
go
unless
we
did
billie
and
violet
laughed
for
they
realized
the
truth
of
what
she
said
we
do
seem
to
be
against
it
as
ted
says
laura
was
always
using
her
brother
for
an
excuse
for
her
own
slang
i
ca
think
of
a
single
person
jolly
enough
to
please
us
and
dull
enough
to
please
the
folks
how
about
one
of
our
mothers
violet
suggested
i
know
my
mother
would
do
it
said
billie
the
last
time
i
asked
her
to
chaperone
us
girls
she
said
she
would
as
soon
chaperone
a
trio
of
eels
and
when
i
asked
mother
laura
added
she
said
she
would
have
nervous
prostration
in
a
week
my
we
must
have
a
terrible
reputation
sighed
violet
i
never
knew
we
were
as
bad
as
all
that
oh
i
have
an
idea
cried
laura
suddenly
clapping
her
hands
well
do
let
it
bite
you
murmured
billie
wait
till
you
hear
and
you
wo
be
so
sarcastic
retorted
laura
sure
i
have
just
the
very
person
that
we
want
oh
who
cried
violet
maria
gilligan
our
housekeeper
laura
announced
and
then
sat
back
with
an
air
that
said
just
as
plainly
as
words
there
how
that
for
an
inspiration
maria
gilligan
your
housekeeper
billie
repeated
i
think
it
a
rather
good
idea
laura
said
violet
is
gilligan
the
one
who
is
always
playing
jokes
on
her
husband
yes
she
the
funniest
thing
you
ever
saw
laura
answered
her
eyes
beginning
to
twinkle
at
the
memory
of
some
of
escapades
why
one
april
fool
day
she
set
the
clock
back
an
hour
and
gilligan
got
up
grumbling
that
it
was
awfully
dark
for
six
then
when
he
was
all
ready
and
was
starting
out
to
work
she
told
him
about
it
what
did
he
do
asked
violet
interested
i
know
what
i
have
done
if
i
been
in
his
place
sniffed
billie
i
have
tied
her
in
a
chair
and
gagged
her
and
left
her
there
all
day
billie
how
barbaric
cried
violet
what
would
you
have
done
that
for
just
so
she
could
have
thought
over
her
sins
said
billie
with
a
chuckle
i
never
did
believe
in
practical
jokes
and
then
another
time
said
laura
her
eyes
twinkling
she
was
upstairs
straightening
up
the
when
she
pretended
to
have
a
tumble
you
know
she
weighs
about
two
hundred
pounds
at
a
rough
guess
i
should
say
three
hundred
murmured
billie
for
billie
was
in
a
very
contrary
mood
that
day
and
she
came
down
with
a
thump
that
shook
the
chandeliers
laura
went
on
ignoring
the
interruption
and
when
gilligan
you
know
he
weighs
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
and
is
about
half
her
size
now
i
she
weighs
three
hundred
interposed
billie
again
just
a
matter
of
arithmetic
there
she
was
with
her
head
in
her
hands
went
on
laura
too
much
amused
by
her
story
to
notice
the
interruption
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
and
when
he
got
down
on
his
knees
to
comfort
her
she
just
looked
at
him
with
a
grin
and
said
fool
well
i
should
say
he
was
said
billie
with
another
sniff
and
not
only
an
april
fool
either
she
would
try
a
trick
like
that
just
about
once
with
me
well
anyway
laura
concluded
i
think
she
would
be
just
the
one
to
take
on
our
trip
with
us
she
jolly
and
full
of
fun
and
yet
she
old
enough
and
fat
enough
to
please
our
fathers
and
mothers
what
do
you
say
do
you
suppose
she
fat
enough
to
scare
away
the
ghosts
asked
billie
with
a
chuckle
my
but
i
be
sorry
for
any
mistaken
ghost
that
tried
to
have
a
with
her
laughed
laura
she
just
laugh
at
them
and
say
ghost
do
bodder
me
all
right
let
ask
her
decided
billie
now
that
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
change
cherry
corners
into
a
summer
resort
i
ca
wait
to
get
started
if
only
the
folks
will
be
willing
said
violet
looking
worried
mother
is
funny
about
letting
me
go
anywhere
away
from
home
without
her
i
guess
all
our
parents
are
said
billie
then
added
with
a
sudden
inspiration
i
tell
you
what
let
all
go
together
and
ask
them
three
are
always
stronger
than
one
you
do
have
a
good
idea
once
in
awhile
billie
exclaimed
laura
jumping
out
of
the
swing
and
holding
out
a
hand
to
each
of
them
come
on
we
ca
afford
to
waste
any
time
where
shall
we
go
first
asked
violet
to
laura
billie
decided
if
we
can
get
her
mother
and
father
to
consent
and
then
can
get
gilligan
to
go
with
us
as
chaperone
have
a
pretty
good
argument
to
give
our
folks
eh
what
gaily
the
girls
set
off
to
win
laura
parents
over
to
their
side
and
they
were
lucky
enough
to
find
jordon
at
home
also
teddy
was
there
sitting
beside
her
on
the
veranda
at
sight
of
billie
the
boy
jumped
to
his
feet
and
came
running
down
to
her
hello
he
cried
i
was
just
coming
over
your
way
to
see
if
chet
did
want
to
fight
out
our
singles
tournament
he
two
sets
ahead
of
me
now
and
i
thirsting
for
i
think
he
give
it
to
you
all
right
laughed
billie
as
violet
and
laura
ran
up
the
steps
in
front
of
them
i
never
seen
the
time
yet
when
chet
refused
a
tennis
game
all
right
i
off
then
he
cried
and
was
starting
away
when
she
called
him
back
do
you
want
to
know
about
my
inheritance
she
asked
him
with
a
demure
little
glance
your
what
he
cried
then
suddenly
he
grasped
her
two
hands
and
swung
them
joyfully
back
and
forth
do
you
mean
to
say
he
cried
that
your
aunt
really
left
you
something
what
is
it
billie
go
on
tell
me
if
you
want
to
hear
all
about
it
just
stay
around
for
a
little
while
she
laughed
leading
him
toward
the
group
at
the
other
end
of
the
porch
two
members
of
which
were
already
in
animated
conversation
may
we
get
in
on
this
she
called
interrupting
an
eloquent
appeal
on
laura
part
oh
yes
come
here
do
cried
laura
clutching
at
her
dress
and
dragging
her
into
the
circle
mother
beginning
to
shake
her
head
and
you
must
let
her
billie
she
do
anything
for
you
jordon
laughed
and
made
room
for
billie
on
the
divan
beside
her
now
perhaps
you
tell
me
she
said
what
this
crazy
daughter
of
mine
is
talking
about
so
far
i
got
a
sort
of
confused
jumble
of
a
haunted
house
and
vacations
and
gilligan
i
must
confess
i
do
see
how
the
three
can
possibly
be
connected
then
billie
told
all
over
again
the
story
of
her
strange
inheritance
while
jordon
and
teddy
listened
with
interest
and
violet
and
laura
now
and
then
put
in
a
word
to
plead
their
cause
as
for
teddy
he
was
so
busy
watching
billie
flushed
excited
and
altogether
charming
face
that
he
more
than
once
lost
the
trend
of
the
conversation
i
do
wonder
laura
said
mother
could
refuse
her
anything
he
thought
i
do
see
how
any
one
could
refuse
her
when
she
talks
and
looks
that
way
billie
a
wonder
that
all
and
in
this
case
billie
did
indeed
prove
herself
to
be
a
wonder
within
half
an
hour
she
had
not
only
won
jordon
over
to
their
side
but
had
persuaded
her
to
let
the
girls
borrow
gilligan
for
the
time
of
their
vacation
of
course
jordon
warned
them
as
the
girls
were
hugging
each
other
triumphantly
we
are
at
all
sure
that
gilligan
will
want
to
undertake
such
an
expedition
i
could
blame
her
very
much
if
she
did
she
added
with
a
rueful
little
smile
knowing
you
girls
as
she
does
i
get
her
cried
laura
and
promptly
put
her
words
into
action
she
appeared
the
next
minute
dragging
a
very
much
astonished
housekeeper
after
her
and
proudly
presented
her
prize
to
her
mother
she
said
she
was
busy
mother
and
could
stop
laura
said
adding
with
a
bright
smile
but
i
told
her
it
was
something
awfully
important
you
wanted
to
say
to
her
sure
and
i
suppose
the
young
girl
is
up
to
some
of
her
tricks
said
gilligan
beaming
fondly
upon
her
captor
but
i
came
with
her
thinking
it
possible
you
might
really
have
something
to
say
to
me
mrs
jordon
yes
i
have
gilligan
sit
down
wo
you
please
it
may
take
some
time
to
persuade
you
and
then
and
there
began
another
campaign
however
with
jordon
as
a
powerful
ally
the
girls
had
little
trouble
in
overcoming
objections
and
in
the
end
came
off
with
colors
flying
now
to
see
billie
mother
cried
laura
the
girls
hugged
jordon
waved
to
their
new
chaperone
and
ran
gayly
down
the
steps
teddy
with
a
whispered
word
to
his
mother
followed
them
say
wait
for
a
fellow
ca
you
he
cried
and
they
turned
to
wait
for
him
come
on
vi
cried
laura
catching
hold
of
violet
arm
and
hurrying
forward
ted
and
billie
will
get
there
some
time
we
wait
for
them
how
do
you
like
our
new
plans
asked
billie
looking
up
at
him
with
sparkling
eyes
i
think
you
ought
to
have
all
sorts
of
fun
he
told
her
adding
with
a
funny
little
smile
but
i
ca
quite
make
out
yet
where
we
fellows
come
in
oh
did
i
tell
you
she
asked
surprised
why
you
are
going
with
us
chapter
xii
great
plans
after
permission
for
the
outing
was
gained
from
all
the
parents
concerned
everything
was
bustle
and
excitement
for
a
week
the
girls
spent
the
whole
of
every
day
at
each
other
houses
planning
their
vacation
talking
about
the
clothes
they
would
need
to
take
with
them
and
generally
enjoying
themselves
as
the
time
drew
near
they
could
hardly
contain
their
excitement
and
the
boys
who
had
decided
they
would
follow
the
girls
some
days
later
were
almost
as
bad
i
do
see
why
you
do
come
with
us
billie
pouted
one
night
when
the
entire
crowd
of
young
folks
had
assembled
at
her
home
it
would
be
lots
more
fun
on
the
train
if
you
boys
were
with
us
but
there
is
the
tennis
match
we
promised
to
play
with
the
fellows
of
the
south
end
chet
pointed
out
for
perhaps
the
hundredth
time
we
could
back
out
of
it
at
the
last
minute
you
know
they
think
we
were
afraid
now
how
do
you
know
violet
pointed
out
but
what
we
will
all
have
been
eaten
up
by
the
ghosts
by
the
time
you
get
there
ghosts
scoffed
ferdinand
stowing
who
was
to
go
with
chet
and
teddy
i
do
see
where
you
girls
get
this
ghost
stuff
just
because
a
house
happens
to
be
old
does
say
it
haunted
gosh
listen
to
him
cried
chet
indignantly
some
one
is
always
taking
the
joy
out
of
life
say
you
do
think
it
haunted
do
you
asked
ferd
in
surprise
of
course
not
answered
chet
adding
with
a
chuckle
but
i
have
my
hopes
well
so
have
i
spoke
up
laura
promptly
if
there
is
a
family
ghost
or
two
about
the
place
we
just
wo
have
any
fun
what
the
use
of
going
off
into
the
wilderness
to
a
spooky
house
if
we
not
going
to
meet
a
ghost
well
you
know
i
did
promise
any
ghosts
said
billie
looking
up
from
a
piece
of
fancy
work
she
was
embroidering
if
you
are
disappointed
you
need
blame
it
on
me
laura
or
you
either
chet
well
i
do
see
why
we
should
have
a
good
time
without
ghosts
put
in
violet
in
fact
i
do
think
i
particularly
enjoy
meeting
somebody
in
the
dark
oh
vi
you
give
me
the
creeps
said
laura
with
a
little
shiver
billie
do
you
think
half
a
dozen
middies
would
do
we
wo
want
to
dress
up
very
much
no
the
ghosts
probably
would
know
the
difference
said
teddy
wickedly
by
the
way
boys
he
went
on
imitating
laura
tone
to
perfection
that
one
important
thing
we
have
decided
yet
what
are
we
going
to
wear
you
poor
fish
cried
ferd
throwing
a
cushion
at
him
who
let
you
in
stop
wrecking
the
furniture
exclaimed
billie
from
her
corner
and
do
stop
talking
all
at
once
you
make
my
ears
ache
and
besides
i
want
to
say
something
silence
cried
chet
in
a
dramatically
deep
voice
the
queen
is
about
to
speak
he
said
something
that
time
whispered
teddy
in
her
ear
and
a
little
pink
flush
mounted
to
billie
face
making
her
look
prettier
than
ever
it
was
so
nice
to
have
one
friends
like
you
why
i
was
just
thinking
about
the
cooking
she
said
do
any
of
you
boys
know
how
to
cook
heavens
listen
at
her
cried
ferd
in
alarm
is
she
going
to
set
us
to
work
already
before
we
get
there
what
the
idea
billie
well
replied
billie
biting
off
her
thread
calmly
we
have
to
eat
while
we
there
you
know
no
cried
chet
sarcastically
you
may
sweet
sister
but
not
us
we
are
too
ethereal
say
is
he
insulting
us
cried
ferd
indignantly
say
that
again
i
dare
you
oh
for
goodness
sake
keep
still
cried
laura
clapping
her
hands
to
her
ears
you
make
me
deaf
dumb
and
blind
now
billie
what
were
you
going
to
say
simply
that
since
we
do
have
to
eat
chet
or
anybody
else
to
the
contrary
she
looked
at
her
brother
and
dimpled
adorably
we
will
have
to
decide
who
is
going
to
do
the
cooking
why
i
suppose
we
take
our
turns
at
it
as
we
done
before
when
we
have
been
camping
said
laura
in
surprise
i
know
but
what
i
want
to
find
out
is
are
the
boys
going
to
do
any
of
the
work
good
land
is
she
asking
us
to
cook
asked
ferd
why
billie
we
know
a
thing
about
it
and
do
want
to
learn
added
chet
fervently
oh
you
big
fibbers
billie
eyes
danced
as
she
looked
at
them
i
remember
oh
i
have
a
very
good
memory
and
she
glanced
sideways
at
teddy
who
was
beginning
to
look
uncomfortable
i
remember
a
certain
person
telling
me
how
beautifully
you
boys
cooked
while
you
were
at
camp
say
billie
that
not
fair
cried
teddy
with
a
guilty
note
in
his
voice
that
made
his
two
comrades
look
at
him
accusingly
aha
we
see
the
villain
cried
ferd
threateningly
what
we
do
with
him
chet
nothing
bad
enough
for
such
a
crime
said
chet
ruefully
what
did
you
make
such
a
break
for
ted
i
thought
i
brought
you
up
better
gee
billie
do
you
see
what
you
let
me
in
for
said
ted
miserably
but
billie
only
regarded
him
with
laughing
eyes
while
laura
and
violet
seemed
to
be
enjoying
the
situation
immensely
i
do
see
what
i
did
billie
replied
innocently
i
thought
i
was
paying
you
boys
a
compliment
by
saying
that
you
could
cook
well
but
we
ca
cried
ferd
seizing
the
opportunity
eagerly
gee
billie
you
could
eat
the
awful
messes
we
make
why
you
a
good
cook
billie
raised
a
cushion
threateningly
in
the
air
none
of
that
none
of
that
she
warned
him
we
see
through
you
villain
say
she
must
think
you
one
of
the
cherry
corners
ghosts
broke
in
teddy
whimsically
it
pretty
hard
on
a
fellow
when
you
can
see
through
him
billie
but
honest
you
could
ferd
insisted
not
to
be
defeated
in
this
one
last
hope
really
i
do
know
enough
about
an
egg
to
take
the
shell
off
when
i
fry
it
idiot
cried
billie
throwing
the
pillow
at
him
in
earnest
who
ever
heard
of
fried
egg
in
the
shell
i
did
cried
ferd
unabashed
by
the
laughter
and
the
scornful
glances
turned
his
way
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
see
before
you
the
man
that
invented
it
well
but
nobody
has
answered
my
question
said
billie
demurely
after
the
laughter
had
subsided
are
the
boys
going
to
help
cook
or
are
they
not
i
tell
you
what
said
chet
desperately
we
cook
if
you
will
promise
to
eat
it
billie
cried
laura
in
alarm
do
make
any
rash
promises
they
would
probably
put
some
awful
thing
into
the
food
on
purpose
laura
that
some
idea
cried
ferd
looking
at
her
admiringly
while
teddy
and
chet
chuckled
thanks
we
never
would
have
thought
of
that
ourselves
well
said
billie
with
a
little
chuckle
i
imagine
we
would
rather
eat
our
own
cooking
anyway
so
you
need
worry
only
she
added
warningly
as
they
sighed
with
relief
there
is
one
thing
you
have
to
do
and
what
that
they
cried
fearfully
help
wash
the
dishes
she
said
and
in
her
tone
was
no
relenting
and
so
even
to
the
impatient
girls
the
time
passed
quickly
until
at
last
the
great
day
arrived
it
was
a
wonderful
day
sunshiny
and
warm
without
being
too
hot
and
all
three
of
them
were
up
with
the
birds
they
were
to
catch
the
eight
morning
train
and
so
they
had
no
time
to
waste
in
bed
billie
was
in
a
joyful
mood
as
she
got
herself
into
the
pretty
new
dress
she
was
to
wear
on
the
trip
she
ran
around
the
room
humming
to
herself
and
every
once
in
a
while
doing
a
little
dance
step
as
she
realized
that
they
were
at
last
to
embark
upon
their
adventure
and
an
adventure
she
somehow
felt
sure
it
was
to
be
for
even
though
contrary
to
chet
hopes
and
she
smiled
as
she
thought
of
him
they
did
not
meet
with
ghosts
at
cherry
corners
there
would
be
the
fun
of
seeing
for
the
first
time
her
inheritance
it
might
be
a
queer
old
house
and
the
contents
and
the
grounds
about
it
might
be
of
small
value
but
there
was
a
wonderful
thrill
nevertheless
in
being
the
owner
of
it
and
there
was
the
fact
that
it
dated
back
to
revolutionary
times
it
was
really
historic
and
it
all
belonged
to
her
no
wonder
she
sang
as
she
gave
a
last
fond
pat
to
the
pretty
dress
and
tucked
a
wandering
little
strand
of
hair
into
place
her
eyes
danced
and
her
face
was
flushed
but
billie
never
noticed
how
pretty
she
was
she
was
the
first
in
the
that
morning
but
her
mother
soon
came
in
scattering
advice
as
she
came
and
all
through
the
meal
billie
tried
hard
to
listen
dutifully
to
all
the
must
nots
and
do
dos
but
all
the
time
her
eyes
were
on
the
clock
and
her
mind
was
saying
over
and
over
again
in
just
half
an
hour
we
be
on
the
train
in
just
half
an
hour
be
on
the
train
then
chet
came
in
and
her
father
and
finding
that
it
was
almost
train
time
postponed
their
breakfast
to
see
her
off
a
few
minutes
later
they
started
off
to
pick
up
the
girls
on
the
way
to
the
station
they
found
them
waiting
impatiently
and
wildly
eager
to
be
off
about
a
block
from
the
station
they
heard
the
whistle
of
the
train
and
the
girls
would
run
for
it
though
they
really
had
plenty
of
time
at
last
they
were
in
the
train
with
the
boys
and
their
parents
waving
to
them
then
suddenly
they
realized
that
they
were
moving
they
were
actually
on
their
way
give
my
regards
to
the
ghosts
cried
chet
as
the
train
moved
off
and
do
scare
them
all
off
before
i
get
there
chapter
xiii
cherry
corners
as
the
train
drew
out
of
the
station
billie
leaned
back
with
a
sigh
of
pure
happiness
you
know
she
said
looking
at
the
girls
with
sparkling
eyes
this
is
the
very
first
time
that
i
have
ever
been
away
from
north
bend
without
the
folks
but
do
forget
you
got
me
to
look
after
you
put
in
gilligan
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
i
goin
to
see
that
you
do
get
into
mischief
i
do
know
but
what
we
shall
have
to
look
out
that
you
do
get
into
mischief
said
laura
with
a
chuckle
gilligan
told
me
once
that
you
were
to
be
trusted
out
alone
huh
retorted
gilligan
it
him
that
i
would
be
trusting
but
what
she
asked
looking
curiously
at
billie
did
your
brother
mean
by
saying
not
to
scare
away
the
ghosts
before
he
gets
there
oh
laughed
billie
he
has
a
sort
of
idea
that
the
house
at
cherry
corners
is
inhabited
by
spirits
just
because
mother
said
that
the
halls
and
rooms
were
spooky
he
will
be
terribly
disappointed
if
he
does
see
half
a
dozen
ghosts
well
i
would
said
violet
with
a
shudder
for
now
that
they
were
on
the
way
to
their
adventure
her
courage
was
beginning
to
fail
ghosts
repeated
gilligan
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
better
not
any
ghosts
come
around
me
or
i
give
a
taste
of
the
rolling
pin
the
girls
laughed
the
picture
of
maria
gilligan
assaulting
a
ghost
with
a
rolling
pin
was
indeed
a
funny
one
well
said
billie
a
little
later
as
she
started
to
unpin
her
hat
i
do
know
about
you
girls
but
i
going
to
be
comfortable
we
have
a
long
ride
before
us
i
suppose
we
might
as
well
take
off
our
hats
and
stay
awhile
agreed
laura
following
suit
say
girls
she
added
as
she
stuck
her
hat
up
in
the
rack
above
her
head
i
just
thought
of
something
last
night
was
it
anything
important
asked
billie
with
a
wicked
little
look
i
do
know
whether
you
would
think
so
laura
retorted
calmly
i
was
wondering
why
we
did
take
the
night
train
that
reaches
roland
the
nearest
station
to
cherry
corners
in
the
morning
that
would
have
been
a
good
idea
would
it
said
billie
now
we
will
reach
the
house
after
dark
when
all
the
spooks
are
roaming
added
laura
in
a
ghostly
voice
goodness
cried
violet
turning
uncomfortably
in
her
seat
if
you
girls
do
stop
talking
about
ghosts
i
just
get
out
and
go
home
got
your
car
fare
asked
laura
no
but
i
could
always
walk
returned
violet
and
i
almost
rather
do
it
than
spend
the
night
in
the
company
of
ghosts
well
you
better
decide
in
a
hurry
said
billie
with
a
chuckle
because
the
longer
you
take
to
make
up
your
mind
the
farther
you
will
have
to
walk
back
all
right
said
violet
suddenly
goaded
into
an
unusual
firmness
you
promise
me
this
minute
that
you
wo
say
another
word
about
ghosts
until
we
get
there
or
i
get
off
at
the
very
next
station
and
walk
back
it
ten
miles
laura
warned
her
i
do
care
if
it
twenty
she
returned
stoutly
and
laughingly
the
girls
promised
it
would
be
a
crime
to
wear
out
those
perfectly
good
shoes
said
laura
looking
at
violet
trim
suede
footgear
especially
with
prices
going
up
billie
groaned
i
think
i
have
to
try
violet
trick
she
said
if
anybody
mentions
the
high
cost
of
living
to
me
while
we
away
on
this
vacation
get
out
and
walk
home
i
do
care
if
it
a
hundred
miles
going
up
laughed
laura
but
they
promised
just
the
same
for
underneath
billie
lightness
they
knew
that
she
was
still
puzzling
her
wits
for
some
way
to
pay
for
that
broken
statue
here
comes
a
man
with
magazines
said
laura
we
better
get
a
couple
to
pass
the
time
away
an
trip
is
pretty
tiresome
at
least
heard
mother
say
so
they
bought
the
magazines
but
they
might
just
as
well
not
have
done
so
for
when
they
reached
roland
late
that
afternoon
they
had
hardly
peeped
inside
the
covers
the
scenery
was
so
beautiful
and
wild
the
whole
trip
was
so
wonderfully
novel
that
the
time
flew
and
before
they
realized
it
they
had
reached
the
station
next
to
roland
goodness
i
did
think
we
were
anywhere
near
there
yet
cried
violet
as
she
began
to
gather
up
her
things
i
never
knew
a
day
to
go
so
quickly
in
my
life
billie
are
these
your
candies
you
better
not
leave
them
on
the
seat
who
said
i
was
going
to
cried
billie
rescuing
her
sweets
just
as
laura
was
in
the
act
of
sitting
on
them
here
there
just
room
for
them
in
the
corner
of
my
grip
gilligan
have
you
got
the
trunk
checks
i
hope
so
said
the
woman
opening
her
hand
bag
the
girls
watched
her
breathlessly
and
sighed
with
relief
when
she
drew
out
the
checks
all
safe
and
sound
she
said
now
get
on
your
hats
and
coats
girls
we
apt
to
have
a
wild
scramble
at
the
last
if
you
are
ready
beforehand
so
laughing
and
excited
the
girls
obeyed
her
putting
on
their
wraps
hurriedly
and
laughing
at
laura
when
she
got
her
hat
over
one
eye
here
put
it
on
straight
cried
billie
performing
that
service
for
her
friend
we
do
want
to
have
our
reputations
ruined
the
minute
we
step
on
the
platform
who
ever
heard
of
a
perfect
lady
with
her
hat
over
one
eye
well
if
you
do
like
my
company
laura
began
as
she
squinted
at
her
distorted
reflection
in
the
little
mirror
set
in
the
tiny
space
of
wall
between
the
windows
gracious
billie
you
took
it
off
of
one
eye
to
put
it
over
the
other
do
i
look
more
like
a
perfect
lady
with
my
hat
over
my
right
eye
billie
chuckled
and
pushed
the
hat
over
laura
nose
at
which
laura
would
have
protested
vigorously
and
if
must
be
forcefully
if
there
had
not
been
other
passengers
in
the
train
besides
themselves
as
it
was
she
had
to
be
content
with
an
indignant
stare
which
billie
with
twinkling
eyes
calmly
turned
her
back
upon
roland
roland
called
the
conductor
in
stentorian
tones
and
with
little
squeals
of
excitement
the
girls
found
their
hand
baggage
gave
one
last
little
pat
to
their
hats
and
started
toward
the
door
you
go
first
gilligan
cried
violet
pushing
that
woman
before
her
i
wonder
if
vi
expects
the
ghosts
to
meet
us
at
the
station
chuckled
laura
in
billie
ear
she
reminds
me
of
a
relative
of
ours
who
always
pushes
her
escort
in
front
of
her
when
she
meets
a
strange
dog
billie
giggled
caught
her
grip
on
the
arm
of
one
of
the
seats
rescued
it
again
and
finally
made
her
way
with
the
others
to
the
platform
it
was
a
rather
old
and
platform
just
as
roland
proved
to
be
a
rather
old
and
place
and
the
girls
stood
on
it
ruefully
as
they
watched
the
train
rumble
off
in
the
distance
now
we
in
for
it
said
billie
her
eyes
taking
in
a
store
or
two
and
a
drooping
i
wonder
if
this
is
what
they
call
the
village
well
we
not
going
to
live
here
said
gilligan
briskly
and
you
ca
expect
to
find
a
thriving
town
away
off
a
hundred
miles
from
nowhere
come
on
let
see
if
we
can
find
some
sort
of
a
wagon
to
take
us
and
our
belongings
to
cherry
corners
i
do
suppose
she
added
as
they
crossed
the
street
toward
a
building
a
little
more
dilapidated
than
the
rest
that
had
the
words
livery
stable
painted
on
a
blurred
sign
over
the
door
that
there
is
any
sort
of
hotel
or
boarding
house
where
we
might
put
up
for
the
night
mother
did
remember
about
that
you
see
she
had
been
here
only
once
said
billie
but
i
do
imagine
there
is
any
place
that
we
would
want
to
stay
at
she
added
making
a
wry
little
face
the
place
in
truth
was
not
attractive
nor
did
it
promise
much
outwardly
at
least
as
a
refuge
for
the
night
besides
the
street
on
which
were
the
forlorn
looking
stores
and
the
and
a
few
other
nondescript
looking
buildings
that
might
have
been
used
for
almost
any
possible
purpose
there
seemed
to
be
but
two
streets
on
which
were
built
the
dwelling
houses
these
for
the
most
part
were
simple
and
plain
enough
each
with
its
yard
well
or
ill
kept
in
front
and
a
garden
and
chicken
yard
behind
only
one
was
a
little
more
pretentious
in
appearance
but
that
too
had
attached
to
it
its
garden
and
chicken
yard
however
they
found
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
their
finding
a
place
if
place
there
was
to
be
found
to
stay
for
the
night
they
found
the
owner
of
the
livery
stable
with
two
old
but
vehicles
which
he
was
eager
to
place
at
their
disposal
they
spent
some
time
in
getting
enough
provisions
to
last
for
a
time
and
to
supplement
what
had
been
sent
from
north
bend
then
in
half
an
hour
more
with
their
luggage
coming
on
behind
they
were
lumbering
off
over
a
very
rocky
road
toward
the
house
at
cherry
corners
gilligan
was
sitting
in
front
with
the
driver
while
the
three
girls
were
wedged
uncomfortably
in
the
back
seat
it
it
lucky
we
not
fat
gasped
laura
as
a
particularly
rough
place
in
the
road
fairly
shook
the
breath
out
of
her
i
do
know
where
we
would
have
put
ourselves
one
of
us
would
have
had
to
sit
on
the
trunks
on
the
cart
chuckled
billie
ouch
she
cried
as
they
bounced
over
another
thank
you
i
glad
we
have
any
more
than
five
miles
to
go
there
would
be
any
of
us
left
alive
five
miles
grumbled
violet
and
my
foot
asleep
already
here
have
some
candy
offered
billie
soothingly
fishing
one
out
of
her
pocket
it
may
make
you
feel
better
well
it
could
make
me
feel
worse
said
violet
accepting
the
offering
although
she
added
with
a
laugh
i
do
see
how
it
is
going
to
help
my
sleepy
foot
well
get
up
and
stretch
advised
laura
seventh
inning
violet
started
to
follow
her
advice
but
was
flung
back
full
force
into
billie
lap
thereby
squeezing
out
a
startled
umph
from
the
sufferer
say
you
need
take
it
out
on
me
cried
billie
indignantly
i
put
your
foot
to
sleep
she
no
nurse
girl
murmured
laura
the
girls
laughed
and
forgot
their
discomfort
after
a
long
time
of
jostling
and
squeezing
they
rounded
a
turn
of
the
road
and
billie
cried
out
there
it
is
she
said
standing
up
in
the
jolting
vehicle
over
there
through
the
trees
oh
girls
does
it
look
gloomy
chapter
xiv
weird
tales
aye
and
it
is
gloomy
startled
the
girls
looked
around
for
the
voice
then
realized
that
it
was
their
driver
who
had
spoken
he
had
been
silent
all
the
way
from
the
station
and
they
had
all
but
forgotten
him
what
made
you
say
that
asked
billie
rather
wonderingly
for
although
the
man
had
only
repeated
her
own
words
the
tone
in
which
he
said
them
made
them
appear
twice
as
ominous
it
a
gloomy
place
he
said
once
more
with
a
shake
of
his
head
aye
and
there
be
some
folks
around
here
as
says
it
is
haunted
do
do
they
really
think
so
stammered
violet
farrington
beginning
to
wish
herself
back
in
north
bend
aye
they
think
so
he
answered
in
the
same
monotonous
voice
and
there
be
some
times
that
i
do
blame
for
what
they
thinks
do
you
think
it
haunted
asked
billie
with
the
hint
of
a
laugh
in
her
voice
even
here
in
this
forsaken
place
with
dusk
coming
on
and
the
prospect
of
spending
a
night
in
a
house
people
called
haunted
sense
of
humor
did
not
altogether
leave
her
do
you
she
repeated
the
laughter
still
more
marked
in
her
voice
the
driver
twisted
around
in
his
seat
to
see
her
before
he
answered
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
now
he
answered
but
maybe
you
wo
feel
so
much
like
laughin
in
the
morning
in
spite
of
herself
billie
shivered
a
little
and
the
other
girls
looked
frightened
if
i
was
you
the
driver
went
on
with
his
unasked
advice
i
turn
right
back
an
spend
the
night
in
roland
there
a
boardin
house
nonsense
we
not
going
to
turn
back
spoke
up
gilligan
a
trifle
sharply
for
she
could
see
that
the
driver
evil
prophecies
were
getting
on
the
girls
nerves
if
there
are
any
ghosts
in
that
house
which
of
course
there
ai
they
just
better
show
their
faces
around
me
that
all
i
give
such
a
taste
of
my
rolling
pin
that
they
get
discouraged
for
good
and
all
she
nodded
her
head
vigorously
and
the
girls
laughed
all
right
all
right
grumbled
the
driver
disgruntled
at
having
his
ideas
treated
in
this
highhanded
manner
you
can
laugh
all
wanting
to
but
i
tell
you
if
it
was
me
which
it
is
gilligan
interrupted
shortly
i
would
stay
in
that
there
haunted
place
for
a
farm
i
would
what
makes
you
think
it
haunted
laura
persisted
for
of
the
three
girls
laura
was
by
far
the
most
curious
do
people
see
lights
and
hear
funny
noises
and
such
things
laura
began
violet
in
protest
why
no
miss
said
the
driver
reluctantly
i
do
know
as
they
actually
seen
things
but
they
has
heard
queer
noises
there
was
some
boys
once
he
went
on
warming
to
his
task
of
story
teller
as
thought
they
have
some
fun
you
know
the
old
lady
what
owned
the
place
was
nearly
allus
away
and
just
left
it
to
a
caretaker
that
take
over
much
care
of
it
he
stopped
to
chuckle
and
the
girls
leaned
forward
eagerly
what
about
them
asked
billie
impatiently
well
they
thought
as
they
play
burglar
an
break
into
the
place
make
a
regular
lark
of
it
were
they
afraid
they
get
caught
asked
laura
not
with
sheriff
higgins
on
the
job
chuckled
the
driver
in
high
good
humor
now
that
he
was
getting
off
his
favorite
yarn
they
were
nearing
the
house
and
the
girls
hurried
him
on
impatiently
well
they
heard
such
funny
humming
noises
and
jingling
like
the
rattling
of
chains
an
things
said
the
driver
that
they
got
most
scared
to
death
and
ran
back
home
like
the
old
nick
was
after
them
ever
since
then
folks
has
said
the
place
was
haunted
stuff
and
rubbish
said
gilligan
as
the
team
came
to
a
stop
before
the
house
a
nice
lot
o
talk
i
call
that
to
fill
the
girls
up
with
rattlin
of
chains
and
hummin
noises
huh
and
with
her
nose
in
the
air
to
show
her
contempt
of
all
such
notions
she
swept
out
of
the
carriage
the
girls
followed
and
ran
back
to
the
wagon
that
contained
their
luggage
and
some
provisions
the
boy
who
had
been
driving
this
wagon
was
already
unloading
it
and
the
old
fellow
who
had
told
them
such
gloomy
tales
came
hobbling
back
to
lend
a
hand
billie
fished
in
her
pocketbook
for
the
key
to
the
house
which
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
and
finding
it
held
it
up
with
a
hand
that
was
not
quite
steady
come
on
she
said
we
got
to
do
it
i
suppose
going
first
asked
violet
regarding
the
gloomy
bulk
of
the
rambling
old
house
now
half
hidden
in
the
dusk
with
troubled
eyes
i
am
of
course
said
billie
stoutly
adding
with
a
gay
little
laugh
i
guess
it
my
right
is
it
why
this
is
my
house
the
first
ever
owned
and
welcome
you
be
to
it
murmured
the
old
man
to
be
promptly
cowed
by
a
withering
look
from
gilligan
come
on
cried
billie
again
i
go
first
but
you
have
to
promise
to
follow
me
in
why
of
course
we
follow
you
in
said
violet
loyal
through
all
her
fear
you
do
suppose
we
let
you
go
into
that
awful
place
alone
do
you
well
i
like
that
cried
billie
leading
the
way
up
the
walk
calling
my
beautiful
old
homestead
an
awful
place
yes
i
surprised
at
you
vi
added
laura
as
she
followed
close
at
billie
heels
do
you
know
you
should
have
some
tact
even
if
it
is
awful
you
should
talk
about
it
billie
stopped
and
stared
indignantly
if
you
say
another
word
she
threatened
i
make
you
go
first
the
threat
had
the
desired
effect
and
both
violet
and
laura
protested
that
it
was
the
most
beautiful
place
on
the
face
of
the
earth
or
words
to
that
effect
you
better
be
giving
the
key
to
me
said
gilligan
we
ca
stand
out
here
talkin
all
night
besides
the
door
probably
has
an
lock
on
it
and
they
ai
a
lock
anywhere
that
can
fool
me
billie
meekly
handed
over
the
key
and
gilligan
marched
majestically
before
them
up
to
the
front
door
she
bent
down
to
examine
the
lock
then
fitted
the
key
into
it
with
a
groaning
and
squeaking
of
rusty
hinges
the
heavy
door
swung
inward
and
the
girls
found
themselves
staring
into
a
black
well
of
hallway
that
seemed
to
have
no
windows
anywhere
gracious
did
anybody
think
to
bring
matches
asked
laura
in
an
awed
whisper
sure
and
i
did
gilligan
voice
reassured
her
five
whole
boxes
i
brought
but
i
got
something
even
better
than
that
for
the
present
occasion
she
drew
from
the
pocket
of
her
coat
a
small
electric
torch
and
flashed
it
into
the
interior
of
the
house
the
bright
light
showed
them
glimpses
of
queer
chairs
standing
about
in
odd
corners
and
finally
lighted
up
a
broad
stairway
it
the
hall
announced
gilligan
now
forward
march
and
soon
find
out
where
the
lights
are
there
must
be
a
push
button
somewhere
suggested
violet
and
even
in
their
present
nervous
state
the
other
girls
laughed
at
her
a
push
button
cried
laura
do
you
expect
to
find
electric
lights
out
in
this
wilderness
we
lucky
if
we
find
a
chandelier
somewhere
added
billie
i
hope
we
do
have
to
burn
candles
or
lamps
they
are
just
exactly
what
you
might
call
cheerful
and
something
cheerful
is
what
we
need
added
laura
ruefully
well
if
you
after
acetylene
gas
i
guess
you
be
disappointed
said
gilligan
as
her
torch
lighted
up
a
wonderful
richly
carved
candelabrum
containing
a
dozen
candles
half
burned
and
looking
rather
wilted
it
candles
we
be
burning
while
we
here
the
girls
groaned
but
they
give
such
a
ghostly
flickering
light
protested
violet
as
if
it
were
in
some
way
gilligan
fault
i
know
i
never
be
able
to
stand
it
and
she
glanced
nervously
over
her
shoulder
well
could
you
stand
the
dark
any
better
asked
gilligan
practically
as
she
began
to
light
the
candles
one
after
another
there
will
probably
be
other
candelabra
in
the
house
and
if
you
get
enough
of
them
burning
there
nothing
in
this
world
that
is
prettier
for
myself
i
just
love
candle
light
yes
when
you
in
civilization
put
in
laura
but
not
out
here
i
found
another
one
cried
billie
who
had
been
prospecting
on
her
own
account
and
here
another
why
we
have
a
big
illumination
before
we
through
that
the
way
to
talk
said
gilligan
approvingly
as
she
crossed
over
to
billie
side
of
the
large
hall
and
began
to
light
the
other
candles
if
we
just
make
the
best
of
everything
and
make
up
our
minds
to
have
a
good
time
we
have
a
good
time
and
if
we
do
we
might
just
as
well
take
the
driver
advice
and
go
home
again
go
home
well
i
should
just
say
not
cried
laura
the
very
idea
of
such
a
thing
the
boys
would
tease
the
life
out
of
us
we
never
hear
the
end
of
it
well
then
we
going
to
have
a
good
time
gilligan
decided
adding
as
she
turned
toward
the
door
where
have
those
men
gone
i
told
them
to
bring
in
the
things
she
went
out
to
see
about
it
with
the
girls
at
her
heels
and
found
the
old
man
and
the
boy
in
a
heated
argument
over
something
well
if
you
want
to
go
into
that
there
haunted
house
it
your
concern
the
old
man
was
saying
in
a
querulous
voice
as
for
me
i
would
step
a
foot
inside
of
it
no
sir
not
if
you
was
to
give
me
a
farm
chapter
xv
a
noise
in
the
dark
maybe
you
would
do
it
for
a
farm
said
gilligan
striding
resolutely
toward
the
man
and
the
boy
while
the
two
drew
apart
and
stared
at
her
in
surprise
but
you
goin
to
do
it
for
me
if
you
think
i
going
to
lug
those
trunks
and
provisions
and
things
into
the
house
all
by
myself
you
never
was
so
much
mistaken
in
your
life
what
do
you
suppose
i
paying
you
my
good
money
for
now
get
a
move
on
and
hurry
those
things
inside
or
i
have
to
take
a
hand
in
the
matter
myself
trunks
first
and
too
much
surprised
by
this
deluge
of
words
to
refuse
the
old
man
turned
to
the
trunks
and
assisted
by
the
boy
carried
them
into
the
hall
this
is
far
enough
he
said
but
maria
gilligan
accustomed
to
having
her
own
way
would
have
none
of
it
upstairs
she
ordered
you
do
suppose
we
are
going
to
sleep
on
the
ground
floor
do
you
and
we
not
going
to
carry
them
ourselves
either
and
once
more
the
old
man
obeyed
her
while
the
boy
wicked
youngster
laughed
at
him
behind
his
back
if
you
meet
a
ghost
coming
downstairs
gramper
he
taunted
just
tell
him
to
be
careful
and
not
stumble
over
you
there
now
be
careful
will
you
you
almost
dropped
the
thing
on
my
foot
the
girls
watched
the
two
go
upstairs
with
gilligan
bringing
up
the
rear
to
make
sure
they
did
not
stop
half
way
and
then
turned
to
each
other
with
a
queer
expression
half
of
amusement
half
of
uneasiness
on
their
faces
well
we
always
wanted
an
adventure
said
laura
as
they
turned
back
to
the
open
door
feeling
an
instinctive
need
of
getting
out
of
the
house
and
now
we
having
one
a
regular
one
agreed
billie
adding
decidedly
and
i
going
to
enjoy
myself
why
laura
with
a
touch
of
excitement
did
you
notice
those
funny
old
chairs
and
things
they
really
very
pretty
and
they
are
surely
very
old
i
should
wonder
oh
billie
cried
violet
rapturously
do
you
suppose
you
could
get
real
money
for
them
if
you
could
she
added
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
that
made
the
girls
laugh
it
would
be
worth
even
braving
the
ghosts
for
you
do
really
believe
that
silly
thing
do
you
asked
billie
turning
back
into
the
hall
it
all
in
a
foolish
old
imagination
all
right
and
now
you
can
bring
in
the
provisions
they
heard
gilligan
directing
i
do
know
where
the
kitchen
is
but
i
suppose
there
is
one
somewhere
i
find
it
while
you
start
to
bring
the
things
in
we
each
take
a
candle
cried
billie
her
eyes
shining
in
the
flickering
candle
light
and
look
for
the
kitchen
come
on
girls
follow
the
leader
so
with
gilligan
at
the
head
they
marched
through
what
seemed
to
be
a
library
seen
dimly
by
the
light
thrown
by
their
four
candles
into
a
room
whose
table
and
chairs
showed
it
to
be
the
the
kitchen
must
be
just
beyond
then
said
laura
beginning
to
enjoy
herself
immensely
there
a
door
gilligan
look
out
do
bump
your
head
but
gilligan
had
no
intention
of
bumping
her
head
she
swung
open
the
door
in
question
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
butler
pantry
that
seemed
almost
as
large
as
billie
bedroom
at
home
goodness
the
powerson
that
first
built
the
house
must
have
expected
to
entertain
lots
of
company
exclaimed
violet
looking
with
wonder
at
the
rows
of
curtained
cupboards
i
wonder
if
there
are
dishes
in
all
of
them
we
have
time
to
look
now
said
gilligan
stopping
her
as
she
was
about
to
peep
inside
a
closet
we
can
do
all
that
when
we
have
daylight
ah
here
the
kitchen
she
added
as
she
stepped
into
a
huge
room
the
regular
type
of
a
very
old
kitchen
that
could
be
used
as
as
well
gracious
it
a
house
cried
billie
moving
her
candle
about
in
an
effort
to
light
up
the
corners
of
the
place
there
is
any
end
to
it
i
glad
i
do
have
to
keep
it
clean
as
a
steady
job
said
gilligan
grimly
now
girls
let
go
back
and
find
our
two
friends
with
the
provisions
i
do
know
how
you
feel
about
it
but
as
for
me
a
little
something
to
eat
would
go
at
all
bad
we
just
starved
they
cried
and
began
a
concerted
rush
back
to
the
front
of
the
house
where
their
friends
with
the
provisions
were
however
when
they
arrived
there
they
found
the
provisions
spread
upon
the
driveway
but
the
man
and
boy
had
disappeared
humph
grunted
gilligan
her
mouth
straightening
to
a
grim
line
i
had
more
than
a
notion
that
that
old
fellow
would
clear
out
and
of
course
the
young
one
would
stay
alone
i
should
have
trusted
them
out
of
my
sight
she
began
picking
up
bags
and
packages
and
the
girls
followed
suit
before
very
long
they
had
gathered
up
all
the
provisions
and
were
staggering
back
arms
laden
toward
the
house
they
found
their
way
back
to
the
kitchen
again
and
dropped
the
things
thankfully
on
the
table
now
for
something
to
eat
cried
laura
what
shall
we
have
gilligan
i
suppose
it
will
have
to
be
a
cold
supper
she
added
looking
about
for
some
means
of
cooking
and
discovering
only
an
immense
coal
stove
i
suppose
it
would
take
forever
to
make
a
fire
in
that
said
billie
indicating
the
stove
and
thinking
longingly
of
hot
steak
and
potatoes
even
if
they
have
any
coal
here
plenty
of
coal
said
gilligan
who
had
been
finding
things
out
in
her
own
practical
and
efficient
way
and
here
is
plenty
of
wood
and
old
newspapers
to
start
it
going
indeed
and
we
not
going
to
have
any
cold
supper
she
added
while
in
imagination
the
girls
already
were
sniffing
the
aroma
of
broiling
steak
not
after
that
long
ride
cheerful
conversation
with
the
prospect
of
supper
and
a
hot
supper
so
close
at
hand
the
girls
could
laugh
at
the
gloomy
stories
of
the
old
driver
we
help
cried
laura
come
on
girls
let
see
if
we
can
find
enough
dishes
to
set
the
table
so
they
went
gayly
to
work
setting
the
table
and
peeling
potatoes
which
gilligan
proceeded
to
fry
and
enjoyed
themselves
immensely
shall
we
eat
in
the
kitchen
asked
violet
pausing
with
a
pile
of
plates
in
her
hand
or
shall
we
be
very
proper
and
eat
in
the
oh
the
kitchen
a
lot
more
cheerful
said
billie
shivering
a
little
in
spite
of
herself
as
she
thought
of
the
dark
rather
dreary
room
just
the
other
side
of
the
door
besides
what
we
want
we
want
in
a
hurry
said
laura
taking
the
dishes
from
violet
and
setting
them
decidedly
on
the
table
will
be
time
enough
to
put
on
airs
just
now
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
eat
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
supper
to
cook
and
after
they
had
done
as
much
as
they
could
toward
its
preparation
the
girls
looked
about
the
kitchen
and
the
gloomy
dining
room
a
bit
the
latter
room
was
dark
and
cheerless
and
they
wondered
that
any
one
should
have
selected
it
for
a
dining
room
the
woodwork
was
all
of
black
walnut
and
there
was
much
of
it
the
window
frames
and
door
frames
being
heavy
and
ornate
and
the
room
being
wainscoted
with
the
same
dark
wood
the
room
was
large
too
and
there
were
windows
at
one
end
only
and
that
toward
the
north
oh
come
let
us
get
out
of
here
finally
cried
laura
grabbing
each
of
the
other
girls
by
an
arm
and
running
with
them
out
into
the
more
cheerful
kitchen
oh
that
steak
cried
billie
longingly
as
she
drifted
over
to
the
stove
is
it
nearly
done
gilligan
this
is
cruelty
to
animals
gilligan
chuckled
and
turned
the
steak
on
the
other
side
almost
ready
now
she
said
adding
another
piece
of
butter
to
the
golden
browned
potatoes
have
you
girls
cut
the
cake
it
in
one
of
the
packages
i
brought
in
on
the
end
of
the
table
do
cut
it
all
now
she
warned
as
there
was
a
joyful
rush
for
the
cake
we
want
some
of
it
left
for
the
girls
did
not
cut
it
all
quite
but
they
did
cut
a
good
of
it
and
ate
it
all
too
it
was
a
strange
sort
of
meal
the
kitchen
the
hastily
set
table
the
faces
of
the
girls
and
gilligan
brought
out
in
bold
relief
by
the
flickering
candle
light
the
meal
was
delicious
and
the
girls
ate
ravenously
but
from
time
to
time
one
of
them
would
shift
uneasily
in
her
seat
and
look
nervously
over
her
shoulder
into
the
dark
corners
of
the
room
instead
of
the
dinner
making
them
more
courageous
it
seemed
to
be
having
the
opposite
effect
for
when
they
had
finished
their
cake
and
the
steaming
hot
coffee
they
found
themselves
talking
in
whispers
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
the
sound
of
their
own
voices
billie
suddenly
realizing
this
spoke
aloud
and
laura
and
violet
jumped
nervously
what
the
matter
with
us
billie
asked
her
voice
sounding
strangely
loud
and
unnatural
even
to
herself
in
the
hushed
stillness
all
about
we
never
used
to
be
so
awfully
quiet
and
i
sure
we
do
have
to
whisper
about
it
i
i
suppose
shivered
violet
that
it
because
everything
else
is
so
quiet
it
sort
of
has
its
effect
on
us
i
wish
she
added
with
a
sudden
little
outburst
unusual
in
violet
that
that
horrid
old
driver
had
told
us
that
horrid
story
i
catch
myself
listening
for
noises
all
the
time
but
that
foolish
said
gilligan
in
that
tone
that
never
failed
to
give
the
girls
courage
there
is
one
of
us
who
believes
anything
he
said
so
why
let
it
worry
us
come
on
she
said
rising
and
beginning
to
gather
together
the
dishes
we
get
these
things
put
away
in
a
hurry
and
then
go
up
to
bed
i
think
a
good
night
rest
is
what
you
need
oh
but
i
do
want
to
go
up
in
the
spooky
upstairs
part
whispered
violet
to
billie
as
she
scraped
some
odds
and
ends
off
on
a
plate
oh
why
did
we
travel
by
night
so
that
we
could
have
reached
here
in
the
morning
well
we
did
so
there
no
use
worrying
about
it
said
billie
sharply
for
the
situation
was
beginning
to
get
on
her
own
nerves
she
had
caught
herself
dreading
the
moment
when
they
must
leave
the
more
or
less
cheerful
kitchen
for
the
upper
floor
of
the
house
and
then
the
minute
came
take
a
couple
of
candles
apiece
and
follow
me
gilligan
said
i
had
your
grips
all
put
in
the
upper
hall
now
then
let
find
out
what
kind
of
beds
we
have
to
sleep
in
if
any
so
with
little
creepy
chills
chasing
themselves
up
and
down
their
spines
the
girls
obeyed
keeping
close
together
and
looking
fearfully
into
the
dark
shadows
they
had
just
started
up
the
stairs
when
violet
cried
out
her
voice
sounding
sharp
in
the
stillness
what
that
right
over
their
heads
there
came
a
creepy
slithery
sound
followed
by
a
loud
thump
the
girls
groaned
and
clutched
each
other
the
ghost
said
violet
in
a
terrified
whisper
chapter
xvi
shadows
and
mystery
well
if
it
a
ghost
announced
maria
gilligan
in
a
loud
voice
i
never
did
hear
one
that
sounded
so
much
like
a
suitcase
sliding
off
a
trunk
the
girls
giggled
and
followed
gilligan
as
she
strode
up
the
stairs
the
flickering
candles
made
grotesque
shadows
on
the
walls
the
house
after
that
noise
was
as
still
as
a
tomb
and
despite
the
comforting
presence
of
their
valiant
chaperone
the
girls
kept
close
together
for
protection
you
suppose
it
was
only
a
stammered
violet
do
whisper
in
my
ear
you
tickle
hissed
billie
and
again
they
laughed
hysterically
look
out
now
go
slow
gilligan
was
cautioning
them
we
want
to
stumble
over
this
luggage
and
get
a
broken
leg
or
two
ouch
she
exclaimed
as
she
stubbed
her
toe
against
something
hard
i
guess
the
first
casualty
she
bent
down
to
find
what
she
had
stumbled
against
while
the
girls
glanced
nervously
into
the
corners
of
the
hall
which
the
flickering
candle
light
only
seemed
to
make
more
dark
goodness
if
we
feel
like
this
now
i
do
see
how
we
ever
going
to
spend
the
night
here
cried
laura
shivering
a
little
i
do
believe
i
be
able
to
sleep
a
wink
oh
yes
you
will
said
billie
trying
hard
to
make
her
voice
sound
natural
and
unconcerned
we
all
so
tired
we
could
help
sleeping
anywhere
just
as
i
thought
said
gilligan
referring
to
the
object
she
had
stubbed
her
toe
against
your
suitcase
billie
and
the
creepy
noise
we
heard
was
when
it
slid
off
the
trunk
come
on
now
she
added
holding
her
candle
high
over
her
head
again
let
see
what
we
can
find
in
the
way
of
bedrooms
let
go
in
the
first
door
we
reach
suggested
billie
and
at
the
moment
gilligan
candle
showed
a
wide
high
doorway
leading
into
a
black
cavern
of
a
room
well
here
the
first
one
she
said
if
we
have
luck
and
find
some
bedding
she
was
already
feeling
her
way
cautiously
between
several
chairs
and
tables
with
the
girls
following
close
behind
there
the
bed
cried
laura
oh
is
it
funny
a
regular
old
with
a
canopy
over
it
marveled
violet
and
it
made
up
with
clean
things
added
billie
making
another
discovery
goodness
it
makes
you
feel
like
the
princess
when
she
found
all
the
good
things
in
her
room
sure
enough
it
has
been
made
fresh
said
gilligan
as
she
wonderingly
turned
down
a
somewhat
dusty
spread
and
disclosed
snowy
sheets
beneath
somebody
been
keeping
house
anyway
said
laura
here
room
for
two
of
you
girls
said
gilligan
oh
we
all
three
want
to
sleep
together
cried
violet
fearful
that
she
might
be
picked
to
sleep
alone
there
safety
in
numbers
all
right
but
i
have
to
sleep
somewhere
gilligan
reminded
her
with
a
wry
little
smile
are
you
going
to
help
me
find
some
place
this
may
be
the
only
bed
that
in
sleeping
condition
in
the
house
then
we
have
to
sleep
four
in
a
bed
said
billie
with
a
chuckle
but
come
on
let
see
if
some
kind
fairy
has
prepared
for
you
too
mrs
gilligan
laughing
the
girls
pushed
out
into
the
hall
and
looked
for
the
next
doorway
they
no
longer
glanced
fearfully
in
the
corners
for
something
they
were
afraid
to
see
the
thought
of
the
nice
clean
bed
pushed
all
their
weird
fancies
into
the
background
ghosts
and
clean
beds
did
not
seem
to
go
together
they
found
another
room
just
as
clean
as
the
other
one
and
also
with
a
canopied
in
one
corner
with
cries
of
delight
the
girls
discovered
that
it
also
was
ready
for
occupancy
goodness
i
wonder
who
could
have
done
it
mused
violet
as
she
dropped
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
regarded
the
girls
wonderingly
maybe
it
was
a
ghost
said
laura
with
a
chuckle
and
violet
glanced
around
uneasily
ca
you
forget
about
ghosts
for
five
minutes
she
asked
rather
irritably
for
she
was
tired
after
the
long
day
trip
just
when
beginning
to
be
happy
there
there
cried
billie
soothingly
do
go
and
get
mad
vi
darling
or
our
last
hope
will
be
gone
i
guess
aunt
beatrice
left
it
this
way
gracious
what
that
only
me
opening
a
door
said
gilligan
from
the
farther
end
of
the
room
my
but
you
girls
are
jumpy
better
get
to
bed
she
added
crossing
over
to
them
with
a
decided
step
you
tired
and
everything
will
seem
better
in
the
morning
off
with
you
now
no
not
that
way
as
they
started
toward
the
hall
the
way
they
had
come
in
i
found
a
door
between
our
two
rooms
it
was
opening
that
that
made
you
jump
see
a
connecting
door
cried
billy
delightedly
oh
that
fine
yes
you
can
lock
your
door
gilligan
and
we
lock
ours
and
we
all
be
as
snug
as
bugs
in
a
rug
finished
laura
putting
an
arm
about
violet
and
pushing
her
into
the
other
room
are
you
going
to
take
your
candles
gilligan
called
after
them
i
fancy
you
need
them
to
undress
by
i
fancy
i
need
mine
all
night
said
laura
in
an
undertone
with
a
wry
little
grimace
as
violet
went
back
for
the
candles
i
just
scared
to
death
to
stay
here
in
the
dark
but
we
wo
be
able
to
keep
these
burning
all
night
said
billie
pausing
in
the
act
of
unlacing
her
shoe
to
gaze
at
her
candle
they
will
probably
burn
out
in
a
couple
of
hours
laura
looked
panicky
well
some
one
will
have
to
go
down
and
get
some
more
she
said
and
gazed
at
billie
thoughtfully
goodness
you
need
look
at
me
when
you
say
that
said
the
latter
going
energetically
to
work
on
the
other
shoe
i
would
go
down
into
that
gloomy
place
again
for
all
the
money
there
is
in
the
world
but
we
be
left
in
the
dark
said
laura
staring
at
billie
as
if
it
were
all
her
fault
who
said
anything
about
being
left
in
the
dark
asked
violet
returning
with
a
candle
in
each
hand
the
flickering
light
illumining
her
face
and
making
her
look
like
some
saint
i
did
and
we
will
if
you
do
go
down
and
get
more
candles
said
laura
turning
her
fire
against
the
newcomer
go
down
and
get
candles
all
by
myself
asked
violet
then
she
walked
over
to
the
table
and
set
the
two
candles
down
with
a
decided
thump
you
crazy
she
said
well
the
best
thing
i
can
see
to
do
said
billie
letting
down
her
long
hair
and
brushing
it
vigorously
is
to
get
to
bed
go
to
sleep
and
forget
all
about
it
yes
if
we
sleep
said
laura
doubtfully
as
she
took
her
nightgown
out
of
the
grip
the
girls
undressed
as
quickly
as
they
could
said
their
prayers
and
crawled
under
the
sheets
pulling
them
up
tight
beneath
their
chins
you
know
whispered
billie
after
they
had
been
quiet
for
some
time
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
i
have
an
idea
that
i
got
the
worst
of
this
bargain
now
what
are
you
raving
about
asked
laura
turning
a
pair
of
unnaturally
bright
eyes
upon
her
why
you
chose
the
middle
of
the
bed
and
vi
took
the
end
nearest
the
wall
that
leaves
me
on
the
outside
to
ward
off
the
ghosts
it
is
fair
oh
but
billie
dear
you
ever
so
much
braver
than
we
are
said
violet
cajolingly
do
you
remember
how
you
said
right
along
that
you
were
afraid
of
ghosts
well
i
not
said
billie
stoutly
while
her
eyes
searched
the
far
corners
of
the
room
which
were
beginning
to
get
very
indistinct
and
creepy
in
the
flickering
uncertain
light
of
the
fast
shortening
candles
and
anyway
she
added
the
thought
seeming
to
comfort
her
i
locked
the
door
well
do
you
know
a
ghost
can
walk
right
through
a
door
asked
laura
and
violet
bounced
in
the
bed
and
came
down
with
a
thud
stop
it
she
commanded
i
trying
my
hardest
to
get
to
sleep
before
those
candles
burn
out
when
it
gets
pitch
dark
in
here
i
never
can
and
all
this
comes
under
the
head
of
pleasure
murmured
laura
with
a
little
chuckle
all
right
we
keep
still
agreed
billie
i
think
myself
that
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
get
to
sleep
night
girls
we
all
feel
better
in
the
morning
if
we
here
to
feel
anything
added
violet
gloomily
for
a
long
time
the
girls
lay
and
quiet
but
gradually
the
law
of
nature
asserted
itself
their
eyelids
drooped
and
the
deep
regular
breathing
showed
that
they
were
asleep
it
was
about
three
in
the
morning
that
it
happened
tortured
by
dreams
in
which
she
was
being
chased
by
a
ghost
in
goggles
and
a
green
motor
car
violet
finally
awoke
and
lay
staring
out
at
the
dark
then
suddenly
she
sat
up
her
dream
had
followed
her
into
the
world
of
reality
there
was
the
same
strange
weird
purring
noise
that
sounded
like
yet
was
strangely
unlike
the
chugging
of
a
motor
car
she
sat
absolutely
still
with
every
nerve
tense
feeling
chilly
and
scared
at
last
she
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
leaning
over
touched
laura
gently
on
the
arm
what
the
matter
cried
the
latter
starting
up
fearfully
at
the
same
moment
billie
opened
her
eyes
that
noise
whispered
violet
listen
chapter
xvii
only
a
bat
the
three
girls
sat
quiet
every
nerve
tense
that
same
chilly
sensation
creeping
up
their
spines
and
their
hair
beginning
to
stand
on
end
out
there
in
that
wilderness
at
three
in
the
morning
a
noise
that
sounded
something
like
a
motor
car
and
yet
was
unlike
anything
they
had
ever
heard
before
might
have
frightened
more
experienced
people
than
three
girls
it
comes
whispered
violet
clutching
at
laura
arm
while
laura
in
her
turn
clutched
at
billie
it
coming
closer
oh
girls
is
it
in
the
house
sh
cried
billie
it
a
machine
it
must
be
a
machine
out
on
the
road
but
in
this
forsaken
place
in
the
middle
of
the
night
cried
laura
beginning
to
shiver
as
though
she
were
cold
it
it
ca
be
billie
said
billie
again
listen
the
purring
sound
was
coming
closer
seemed
almost
in
the
house
it
was
so
near
then
came
an
awful
thought
to
billie
could
it
really
be
in
the
house
was
it
possible
that
those
awful
stories
about
ghosts
were
true
but
no
the
noise
was
passing
on
getting
softer
softer
dying
off
in
the
distance
it
it
must
have
been
a
machine
said
laura
beginning
to
laugh
hysterically
vi
what
did
you
go
and
wake
me
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
for
just
to
hear
an
automobile
i
was
having
such
a
lovely
sleep
but
i
not
so
sure
it
was
a
motor
car
insisted
violet
stubbornly
the
spell
of
the
dream
still
upon
her
it
did
sound
like
it
but
it
could
have
been
anything
else
said
billie
trembling
a
little
with
the
reaction
we
heard
it
coming
down
the
road
heard
it
pass
the
house
and
go
on
it
simply
must
have
been
a
machine
oh
all
right
said
violet
adding
with
a
little
sigh
well
i
guess
none
of
us
will
sleep
any
more
i
not
even
going
to
try
well
i
am
said
billie
leaning
back
and
closing
her
eyes
yet
knowing
that
she
was
as
wide
awake
as
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
i
do
see
any
use
in
lying
here
and
listening
for
things
good
night
once
more
girls
i
off
meaning
you
crazy
asked
laura
to
which
billie
made
no
reply
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
while
they
were
saying
they
could
sleep
no
more
that
night
the
girls
did
go
to
sleep
and
what
is
more
slept
soundly
until
they
were
awakened
by
gilligan
voice
calling
to
them
from
the
connecting
doorway
do
you
expect
to
sleep
all
day
she
was
asking
them
her
face
rosy
and
herself
very
nice
and
trim
in
a
light
blue
house
dress
this
is
the
third
time
i
spoken
to
you
and
i
was
beginning
to
get
worried
time
is
it
demanded
laura
sleepily
about
eleven
gilligan
answered
calmly
and
they
gasped
eleven
repeated
billie
sitting
up
in
bed
and
rubbing
her
eyes
hard
for
goodness
sake
how
did
it
get
that
way
i
feel
as
if
i
had
had
any
sleep
at
all
well
i
had
the
most
awful
dreams
complained
violet
turning
over
as
if
she
intended
to
go
to
sleep
again
i
done
nothing
but
dream
of
ghosts
and
motor
cars
all
night
at
the
mention
of
ghosts
gilligan
broke
into
hearty
laughter
ghosts
she
said
her
eyes
sparkling
i
should
think
you
be
talking
of
ghosts
any
more
here
you
spent
a
whole
night
in
the
house
and
no
spirits
have
bothered
you
yet
i
should
think
you
be
satisfied
oh
but
did
you
hear
that
noise
in
the
night
violet
asked
her
turning
over
and
forgetting
the
nap
she
had
been
about
to
take
we
girls
were
just
about
scared
to
death
speak
for
yourself
said
laura
who
whether
she
had
really
been
frightened
or
not
never
liked
to
have
anybody
tell
her
about
it
you
were
scared
too
what
the
use
of
denying
it
violet
demanded
hotly
but
gilligan
interrupted
them
never
mind
about
that
she
said
with
a
smile
just
tell
me
about
this
noise
you
thought
you
heard
so
the
girls
told
her
about
their
weird
experience
of
the
night
before
all
talking
at
once
and
making
it
as
hard
as
possible
for
gilligan
to
understand
what
it
was
all
about
a
noise
that
sounded
like
a
motor
car
she
said
when
they
had
finished
and
had
paused
for
lack
of
breath
well
i
do
see
what
so
very
queer
about
that
may
have
been
some
or
something
but
who
would
be
in
this
part
of
the
country
laura
objected
the
country
people
hereabouts
probably
do
know
what
the
word
means
that
particular
sport
does
seem
to
belong
to
the
idle
rich
gilligan
agreed
with
a
chuckle
well
she
added
getting
up
and
starting
for
the
door
whatever
it
is
or
was
we
need
go
without
our
breakfast
because
of
it
how
would
you
like
some
bacon
and
eggs
and
biscuits
the
suggestion
worked
like
a
charm
and
before
gilligan
had
finished
the
girls
were
out
of
bed
and
feeling
about
for
their
clothes
you
know
the
room
does
look
half
bad
by
daylight
remarked
violet
as
she
was
arranging
her
hair
before
an
elaborately
framed
old
mirror
and
it
surely
is
quite
clean
but
it
horribly
gloomy
just
as
mother
said
billie
was
regarding
the
dingy
woodwork
now
almost
black
with
age
and
the
huge
with
its
funereal
canopied
top
and
the
large
pictures
of
dead
and
gone
ancestors
that
adorned
the
walls
the
only
really
good
things
in
the
whole
room
are
the
tables
and
chairs
they
look
she
added
hopefully
as
if
they
might
bring
in
a
little
money
perhaps
i
be
able
to
pay
for
the
statue
after
all
oh
and
i
just
crazy
to
see
the
rest
of
the
house
by
daylight
said
laura
clapping
her
hands
come
on
you
slow
pokes
are
you
ever
going
to
be
ready
we
ready
now
said
billie
putting
an
arm
about
violet
and
hurrying
her
to
the
door
oh
is
that
bacon
i
smell
and
coffee
she
asked
as
through
the
open
door
came
a
whiff
of
the
good
things
below
you
said
it
cried
laura
making
a
rush
for
lower
floor
with
billie
and
violet
not
very
far
behind
her
and
it
is
going
to
be
more
than
about
two
minutes
before
i
taste
that
same
bacon
and
eggs
when
they
reached
the
lower
hall
they
were
surprised
to
see
that
it
looked
almost
as
gloomy
and
forbidding
as
it
had
the
night
before
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
front
door
was
open
and
sunlight
was
streaming
through
ugh
said
laura
with
a
shudder
i
do
wonder
that
they
had
gloomy
dispositions
in
the
old
days
if
they
had
to
live
in
houses
like
these
it
enough
to
give
one
the
creeps
i
glad
you
like
my
property
so
much
said
billie
with
a
demure
little
smile
i
have
heard
you
say
one
nice
thing
about
it
yet
we
have
treated
our
hostess
rather
rudely
have
we
laughed
violet
putting
an
arm
about
billie
and
drawing
her
out
into
the
sunshine
but
really
billie
we
quite
sure
that
you
do
like
it
any
better
than
we
do
and
you
are
quite
right
billie
assured
her
then
added
breaking
away
and
running
a
little
in
front
of
them
girls
let
see
if
we
can
find
any
signs
of
that
car
we
heard
last
night
eagerly
they
scanned
the
rocky
road
but
could
see
no
traces
of
any
vehicle
that
would
be
big
enough
to
make
the
noise
they
had
heard
the
night
before
the
plot
thickens
said
laura
as
they
started
back
to
the
house
to
eat
the
bacon
and
eggs
and
biscuits
we
hear
a
car
but
see
no
traces
of
it
it
must
have
been
a
spirit
car
said
violet
adding
with
a
plaintive
little
sigh
that
made
the
girls
laugh
in
spite
of
all
my
perfectly
good
training
i
beginning
to
believe
in
ghosts
after
breakfast
the
girls
roamed
around
the
big
house
nosing
into
corners
calling
each
other
attention
to
this
and
that
queer
ornament
or
article
of
furniture
and
there
were
plenty
of
them
and
otherwise
thoroughly
enjoying
themselves
but
as
yet
they
did
not
venture
into
the
gloomy
cellar
with
its
mysterious
tunnels
in
the
they
found
a
queer
old
piano
which
violet
declared
must
date
back
farther
than
revolutionary
days
and
which
billie
amid
gibes
and
laughter
from
her
chums
tried
to
play
after
she
had
tried
and
failed
on
half
a
dozen
different
compositions
she
gave
up
the
attempt
and
they
roamed
upstairs
looking
through
one
room
after
another
until
billie
accidentally
opened
the
door
that
led
to
the
attic
here
where
we
want
to
go
girls
she
cried
mother
said
this
was
the
spookiest
place
in
the
whole
house
except
the
cellar
had
we
better
get
gilligan
to
go
with
us
asked
violet
holding
back
after
last
night
i
had
enough
spooky
experiences
to
last
me
a
week
oh
come
on
cried
laura
running
ahead
of
them
up
the
stairs
show
you
two
cats
who
a
cat
cried
billie
starting
in
hot
pursuit
i
have
you
know
that
nobody
dares
call
me
such
names
and
get
away
with
it
come
on
vi
let
murder
her
just
try
it
laura
hissed
at
them
dramatically
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
turn
into
another
ghost
and
haunt
you
oh
for
goodness
sake
leave
her
alone
billie
violet
entreated
we
got
enough
ghosts
around
here
without
laura
what
that
if
you
going
to
scare
me
again
began
laura
but
it
was
billie
this
time
who
commanded
silence
hush
i
did
hear
something
queer
she
said
and
all
three
listened
intently
it
came
again
a
weird
little
noise
like
the
brushing
of
wings
against
some
hard
object
and
the
girls
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
then
out
into
the
hot
open
attic
fluttered
a
tiny
little
object
with
webbed
wings
and
the
body
of
a
mouse
a
bat
cried
laura
sinking
down
weakly
and
shaking
with
hysterical
laughter
oh
girls
if
i
have
to
stay
here
another
week
i
just
die
of
heart
failure
i
know
i
will
chapter
xviii
a
fish
story
the
days
passed
without
further
scares
until
the
time
finally
came
when
the
boys
were
to
arrive
during
those
days
the
girls
roamed
around
the
farm
attached
to
cherry
corners
they
found
it
for
the
most
part
a
rocky
place
with
here
and
there
dense
patches
of
woods
there
was
a
brook
and
in
this
they
saw
some
small
fish
darting
about
maybe
the
boys
will
want
to
go
fishing
when
they
come
suggested
billie
the
cherry
trees
also
interested
the
chums
there
were
so
many
of
them
the
late
cherries
were
ripe
and
they
spent
a
day
in
picking
them
donning
overalls
for
that
purpose
gilligan
took
the
fruit
and
made
several
delicious
pies
and
also
a
number
of
tarts
the
place
was
certainly
a
lonesome
one
only
once
did
they
see
two
men
tramp
by
the
men
eyed
the
girls
curiously
but
tramped
on
without
speaking
certainly
not
very
sociable
was
violet
comment
at
last
came
the
time
when
the
boys
were
to
arrive
the
girls
were
in
a
fever
of
excitement
and
anticipation
for
they
knew
that
they
would
have
just
about
twice
as
much
fun
with
the
boys
as
without
them
we
can
go
on
picnics
said
laura
putting
on
her
hat
over
one
eye
as
she
had
a
habit
of
doing
when
unusually
excited
and
long
tramps
in
the
woods
and
oh
all
sorts
of
things
i
wonder
if
that
old
wagon
will
ever
come
said
violet
looking
anxiously
down
the
road
if
it
does
hurry
we
be
too
late
to
meet
the
train
the
boy
who
daily
brought
them
provisions
from
the
village
had
been
commissioned
to
send
the
antiquated
carriage
after
the
girls
so
that
they
could
get
down
to
the
village
in
time
to
meet
the
early
train
but
the
girls
with
no
confidence
in
the
country
lad
memory
had
been
sure
he
would
forget
all
about
it
if
he
does
come
pretty
soon
the
boys
will
get
off
the
train
with
no
one
to
meet
them
violet
went
on
worrying
they
wo
know
where
to
go
goodness
they
know
where
to
go
just
as
well
as
we
did
said
billie
regarding
herself
sideways
in
the
mirror
to
be
sure
she
had
not
forgotten
anything
they
are
infants
you
know
here
it
comes
here
it
comes
sang
out
laura
from
her
place
at
the
window
are
you
ready
girls
the
answer
was
a
concerted
rush
for
the
stairs
and
in
another
minute
the
girls
were
out
in
the
bright
sunlight
running
to
meet
the
stage
the
driver
who
had
been
nodding
in
his
seat
looked
up
as
if
surprised
at
so
much
energy
so
early
in
the
morning
oh
please
hurry
cried
billie
exasperated
at
the
stupid
look
on
the
boy
face
do
you
know
that
we
late
already
no
you
not
late
he
assured
her
in
a
voice
that
matched
his
manner
the
train
always
half
an
hour
late
anyways
well
that
just
the
reason
it
will
probably
be
on
time
this
morning
remarked
billie
scrambling
in
after
the
girls
when
i
late
the
trains
are
always
early
please
hurry
she
added
and
the
driver
clucked
to
his
team
all
the
way
down
they
worried
for
fear
they
would
be
late
but
when
they
reached
roland
at
last
they
found
that
their
rural
driver
knew
the
habits
of
trains
in
that
part
of
the
country
better
than
they
did
for
they
had
a
full
minutes
to
wait
however
they
roused
from
their
despondent
attitudes
when
they
heard
a
familiar
whistle
in
the
distance
and
began
automatically
to
straighten
their
hats
suppose
they
made
up
their
minds
not
to
come
on
this
train
violet
suggested
but
laura
cut
in
hastily
if
you
going
to
start
worrying
all
over
again
about
something
different
she
said
i
put
you
on
the
track
and
let
the
train
run
over
you
at
this
dire
threat
violet
stopped
worrying
vocally
at
least
and
they
stood
first
on
one
foot
then
on
the
other
eagerly
watching
the
train
as
it
rounded
a
curve
and
came
pounding
down
toward
them
it
had
hardly
drawn
up
to
the
station
with
a
screeching
of
brakes
and
come
to
a
standstill
before
a
cyclonic
trio
of
boys
leaped
from
one
of
the
rear
cars
and
came
dashing
toward
the
girls
waving
hats
and
bags
and
various
other
personal
articles
high
in
the
air
as
they
came
i
say
but
it
was
bully
of
you
girls
to
come
to
meet
us
shouted
ferd
stowing
as
they
came
within
hailing
distance
it
was
more
than
we
expected
eh
fellows
sure
did
think
you
be
up
yet
answered
teddy
looking
exceedingly
handsome
at
least
to
billie
up
yet
cried
billie
trying
to
look
angry
which
she
could
not
do
because
she
was
altogether
too
happy
and
excited
i
do
know
where
you
boys
get
your
ideas
anyway
out
of
our
brilliant
craniums
said
ferd
modestly
i
say
girls
where
do
we
go
from
here
there
an
old
carriage
that
looks
as
if
it
were
on
its
last
legs
laughed
violet
leading
the
way
back
to
where
the
antiquated
vehicle
and
its
sleepy
driver
awaited
them
we
came
up
in
it
but
i
do
know
how
we
all
going
to
squeeze
into
it
going
back
say
fellows
we
forgot
to
get
our
trunks
said
chet
interrupting
himself
in
the
midst
of
an
earnest
conversation
with
his
sister
give
me
your
checks
and
i
go
back
and
see
about
them
but
if
there
is
room
for
us
how
are
we
ever
going
to
get
our
baggage
to
the
house
teddy
asked
we
get
the
wagon
that
took
ours
up
laura
answered
we
got
to
get
some
provisions
anyway
so
with
a
great
deal
of
fun
and
laughter
they
looked
up
the
ancient
wagon
and
went
to
the
general
store
to
get
a
formidable
supply
of
provisions
looks
as
if
you
were
buying
the
store
out
teddy
remarked
as
billie
pulled
out
a
long
list
of
items
what
the
big
idea
you
boys
said
billie
dimpling
at
him
we
knew
what
kind
of
appetites
you
would
bring
along
with
you
so
we
decided
on
safety
first
now
we
know
you
girls
are
bright
said
ferd
admiringly
and
billie
made
a
face
at
him
the
ride
to
the
house
was
one
big
lark
the
boys
sat
on
the
trunks
among
the
provisions
and
the
girls
went
off
into
gales
of
merriment
at
their
comical
efforts
not
to
step
on
the
eggs
or
fall
among
the
fruit
they
were
having
such
an
awfully
good
time
that
even
the
solemn
old
driver
had
to
join
in
the
fun
at
last
they
reached
billie
house
and
with
much
ceremony
the
boys
jumped
down
from
the
wagon
and
ran
to
the
carriage
to
help
the
girls
out
and
all
they
got
for
their
pains
was
scorn
and
derision
on
the
part
of
the
girls
get
out
of
the
way
before
i
step
on
you
little
speck
of
dust
laura
cried
haughtily
to
ferd
who
turned
up
his
collar
and
slunk
along
toward
the
house
as
though
his
humiliation
were
more
than
he
could
bear
amid
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
merry
crowd
that
followed
him
that
the
way
to
treat
laura
chet
cried
but
at
that
ferd
turned
upon
him
say
you
better
look
out
he
said
belligerently
i
ca
hit
a
lady
a
which
murmured
billie
with
a
wicked
glance
in
laura
direction
for
calling
me
names
continued
ferd
glaring
at
chet
who
began
to
tremble
in
mock
fright
but
there
nothing
to
keep
me
from
wiping
the
ground
up
yes
there
is
it
my
ground
and
i
wo
have
it
wiped
up
said
billie
decidedly
at
which
ferd
had
to
laugh
and
the
mock
war
came
to
a
close
say
this
is
some
classy
place
what
said
chet
stopping
in
front
of
the
rambling
old
house
and
regarding
it
admiringly
have
you
met
with
any
ghosts
yet
girls
oh
half
a
dozen
said
laura
indifferently
and
he
was
just
about
to
ask
some
more
questions
when
gilligan
met
them
at
the
door
and
began
giving
instructions
after
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
obey
and
the
boys
and
girls
did
not
meet
again
until
lunch
time
then
they
regarded
each
other
across
the
table
joyfully
i
say
let
go
for
a
tramp
in
the
woods
this
afternoon
ferd
suggested
after
he
and
the
other
lads
had
taken
a
look
around
the
house
this
is
the
prettiest
wildest
country
i
ever
seen
and
i
like
to
nose
about
a
little
but
we
thought
you
like
to
see
what
the
attic
and
cellar
look
like
said
billie
we
had
the
afternoon
all
planned
let
do
that
ferd
begged
boyishly
this
is
too
nice
a
day
to
spend
indoors
so
it
was
decided
to
go
outside
and
as
soon
as
the
dinner
dishes
were
cleared
away
at
which
the
boys
assisted
without
so
much
as
a
grumble
the
young
folks
started
out
on
their
tour
of
discovery
the
girls
had
spent
much
of
their
time
in
the
old
house
since
their
arrival
for
they
had
found
an
almost
inexhaustible
supply
of
strange
corners
and
unexpected
rooms
and
peculiar
ornaments
that
had
fascinated
them
but
as
they
felt
the
warm
sunshine
on
their
heads
as
the
wind
caressed
their
faces
and
the
scents
of
the
woodland
bathed
them
in
perfume
they
were
glad
they
had
let
the
boys
have
their
way
and
had
decided
to
spend
the
glorious
afternoon
in
the
open
did
you
win
the
tennis
singles
billie
asked
of
teddy
as
she
stopped
to
smell
a
bunch
of
strange
flowers
i
was
rooting
for
you
were
you
asked
teddy
eagerly
for
you
and
chet
she
added
demurely
and
laughed
to
see
his
face
fall
but
did
you
she
asked
what
win
the
tennis
singles
silly
ca
you
remember
a
thing
two
seconds
why
yes
we
did
he
answered
absently
his
gray
eyes
on
billie
lovely
mischievous
face
in
fact
we
just
ran
rings
around
them
i
guess
he
stopped
short
as
they
came
upon
the
other
young
people
a
couple
of
bearded
men
had
come
out
of
the
woods
and
confronted
the
crowd
each
man
carried
a
heavy
club
they
were
the
fellows
who
had
once
passed
the
girls
without
speaking
you
ca
go
any
further
this
way
one
of
them
said
in
a
rather
gruff
tone
we
growing
a
new
variety
of
corn
and
want
to
keep
the
seed
to
ourselves
what
that
demanded
chet
in
astonishment
you
heard
what
i
said
you
ca
stay
here
and
you
ca
go
that
way
you
want
to
get
out
of
here
growled
the
second
man
come
move
on
you
ca
steal
any
of
our
secrets
move
on
and
the
first
man
shook
his
club
suggestively
the
strange
men
looked
ugly
and
the
boys
and
girls
after
a
pause
turned
off
in
another
direction
humph
grunted
ted
with
a
curious
glance
at
the
place
where
the
men
had
been
they
made
a
mistake
that
was
a
corn
story
it
was
a
fish
story
maybe
returned
billie
but
what
does
it
mean
chapter
xix
in
the
dead
of
the
night
there
was
so
much
of
interest
about
the
house
and
outside
of
it
that
a
week
passed
almost
before
the
young
folks
knew
it
the
boys
were
for
exploring
the
cellar
and
did
so
one
fine
day
taking
the
girls
along
they
had
a
flashlight
a
lantern
and
some
candles
and
all
these
combined
gave
them
quite
an
illumination
but
the
girls
kept
close
to
the
boys
for
the
cellar
was
certainly
a
creepy
place
with
its
many
nooks
and
corners
and
dark
closets
they
managed
to
find
two
tunnels
one
about
fifty
feet
long
and
the
other
close
to
a
hundred
caved
in
cried
chet
in
disgust
he
was
right
dirt
and
rocks
filled
the
openings
both
of
which
were
quite
wet
i
bet
they
led
to
the
brook
remarked
teddy
when
the
indians
made
a
raid
the
settlers
could
crawl
through
one
tunnel
or
the
other
and
so
hide
in
the
brook
i
think
ted
must
be
right
said
ferd
there
was
but
little
of
value
in
the
cellar
old
tools
rusted
with
age
and
some
empty
bottles
and
jugs
and
that
was
about
all
it
awfully
musty
said
billie
presently
i
going
upstairs
and
out
into
the
sunshine
and
she
went
and
the
others
soon
followed
billie
had
received
the
address
of
miss
beggs
the
it
had
been
sent
to
her
address
at
home
and
forwarded
by
bradley
now
i
guess
i
have
to
write
that
letter
to
the
teacher
and
explain
all
about
the
broken
statue
said
billie
dismally
oh
dear
i
wish
i
did
have
to
do
it
it
too
bad
we
have
the
money
to
pay
for
the
old
thing
came
from
chet
ca
we
sell
some
of
this
stuff
it
must
be
worth
something
but
who
will
buy
it
i
do
know
there
was
a
long
consultation
among
the
girls
and
at
last
billie
managed
to
write
the
letter
there
she
said
when
she
had
given
it
to
the
store
boy
to
post
now
i
feel
better
the
confession
part
of
it
is
off
my
mind
anyway
if
i
can
only
pay
for
the
old
statue
or
buy
another
one
like
it
i
be
happy
or
nearly
happy
she
added
the
nearly
happy
as
the
thought
came
to
her
that
even
with
the
broken
statue
paid
for
and
off
her
mind
she
had
still
another
ordeal
before
her
in
a
couple
of
weeks
their
vacation
would
be
up
at
cherry
corners
and
soon
after
that
she
would
have
to
see
violet
and
laura
and
the
boys
except
poor
chet
go
off
to
boarding
school
while
she
and
her
brother
would
be
left
behind
oh
well
she
would
not
think
of
that
just
yet
they
could
at
least
enjoy
the
time
they
were
to
spend
at
cherry
corners
and
they
did
enjoy
it
there
was
never
a
minute
of
the
day
for
which
something
interesting
was
not
planned
then
one
night
when
they
had
almost
forgotten
that
the
house
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
they
had
an
experience
that
brought
back
all
their
old
fears
of
the
place
and
then
some
as
teddy
said
billie
sat
up
in
bed
suddenly
with
the
familiar
chilly
feeling
up
and
down
her
spine
and
her
hair
showing
a
tendency
to
pull
away
from
her
prickly
scalp
the
piano
was
sounding
all
the
way
from
treble
to
bass
and
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
with
everybody
in
bed
she
put
out
a
hand
and
shook
laura
and
violet
to
consciousness
oh
girls
it
the
ghost
this
time
she
said
in
a
scared
whisper
that
made
them
wide
awake
in
an
instant
it
it
playing
the
piano
a
a
musical
ghost
giggled
laura
hysterically
but
billie
pinched
her
into
silence
keep
still
she
cried
there
it
is
again
the
girls
listened
to
the
eeriest
weirdest
music
they
had
ever
heard
and
violet
slipped
shivering
under
the
covers
and
hid
her
face
with
the
sheet
out
of
that
cried
billie
pulling
at
the
sheet
what
do
you
suppose
it
going
to
do
to
put
the
sheet
over
your
head
come
on
i
going
to
investigate
with
sudden
determination
she
slipped
out
of
bed
and
stood
up
billie
gasped
laura
you
never
going
to
go
down
there
i
going
to
call
the
boys
said
billie
who
despite
all
her
determination
could
hardly
stand
up
her
knees
trembled
so
we
all
go
and
rout
that
old
ghost
he
got
to
she
added
with
a
hysterical
giggle
that
matched
laura
get
off
my
piano
fearfully
the
girls
watched
her
start
into
gilligan
room
then
laura
pushed
down
the
covers
and
got
to
her
feet
if
billie
is
afraid
she
said
stoutly
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
are
you
coming
vi
i
so
said
poor
violet
more
afraid
of
being
left
alone
than
of
facing
the
ghost
in
company
with
the
others
if
you
going
i
i
got
to
so
it
was
that
gilligan
was
startled
to
find
three
ghostly
scared
figures
standing
by
her
bed
calling
nervously
to
her
to
please
wake
up
for
goodness
sake
what
the
matter
she
said
rubbing
her
eyes
and
staring
at
them
sleepily
have
you
heard
your
ghostly
motor
again
oh
much
worse
cried
violet
we
heard
a
ghost
playing
a
piano
said
laura
listen
commanded
billie
there
it
goes
again
oh
gilligan
gilligan
listened
and
even
she
humorous
irishwoman
that
she
was
felt
that
same
strange
tendency
on
the
part
of
her
hair
to
stand
up
straight
in
the
air
well
here
the
time
for
my
rolling
pin
she
said
jumping
out
of
bed
and
wrapping
a
kimono
hastily
about
her
we
call
the
boys
and
see
what
that
piano
thinks
it
doing
anyway
so
they
called
the
boys
the
three
lads
were
on
tiptoe
with
excitement
at
the
thought
of
an
actual
encounter
with
a
ghost
and
a
musical
ghost
at
that
crowed
ferd
as
they
started
down
the
stairs
with
the
girls
following
cautiously
and
holding
their
candles
over
their
heads
say
do
make
so
much
noise
cried
chet
in
a
stage
whisper
frighten
his
ghostship
away
i
would
miss
seeing
a
real
ghost
for
anything
you
could
offer
me
in
here
fellows
here
the
piano
ferd
directed
and
their
hearts
in
their
mouths
the
girls
watched
them
go
into
the
dark
room
ouch
hang
that
chair
they
heard
ferd
cry
out
come
on
with
those
lights
girls
i
ruining
all
the
furniture
nervously
the
girls
followed
them
in
throwing
the
light
of
the
candles
on
the
old
piano
but
as
far
as
they
could
see
nothing
had
been
disturbed
the
ancient
instrument
stood
as
dignified
and
aloof
as
ever
and
in
the
whole
room
not
a
chair
was
out
of
place
nothing
here
said
chet
looking
disappointed
say
the
girls
promised
us
a
regular
show
fellows
and
they
have
come
across
what
shall
we
do
to
asked
teddy
looking
almost
equally
disappointed
but
we
heard
it
said
billie
shivering
with
excitement
it
was
just
as
if
somebody
had
taken
the
back
of
his
finger
laura
added
and
run
it
all
the
way
down
the
keyboard
from
the
top
note
of
the
treble
to
the
last
note
of
the
bass
oh
you
must
have
been
dreaming
said
ferd
opening
the
piano
to
examine
it
inside
no
they
were
dreaming
said
gilligan
seriously
because
i
was
very
much
awake
when
i
heard
it
you
heard
it
too
asked
chet
beginning
to
be
interested
again
i
certainly
did
said
gilligan
with
a
grimness
that
left
no
room
for
doubt
and
i
not
given
to
imagining
things
either
well
i
move
we
look
around
a
bit
suggested
ferd
who
was
always
eager
for
action
the
ghost
may
have
retreated
to
the
or
something
no
siree
said
violet
decidedly
if
the
rest
of
you
want
to
go
roaming
all
over
this
gloomy
old
place
at
night
you
can
do
it
but
have
to
leave
me
out
vi
right
said
gilligan
just
as
the
boys
were
about
to
protest
there
is
any
use
going
into
this
thing
any
further
and
getting
the
girls
all
upset
i
stay
down
here
awhile
and
see
what
i
can
see
let
me
stay
with
you
asked
chet
eagerly
and
me
and
me
ferd
and
teddy
spoke
almost
in
the
same
breath
no
i
want
you
all
to
go
up
and
get
into
bed
said
gilligan
decidedly
if
i
see
anything
she
added
with
a
grim
smile
anything
that
looks
like
a
ghost
that
is
i
call
you
that
a
promise
said
chet
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
reluctantly
followed
the
others
upstairs
because
if
i
should
miss
getting
a
look
at
that
ghost
i
be
disappointed
for
life
well
i
had
enough
of
spooks
to
last
forever
said
laura
with
a
shivery
glance
over
her
shoulder
as
the
boys
left
the
girls
at
their
door
and
started
off
down
the
hall
if
that
piano
begins
to
play
itself
again
i
just
die
that
all
there
is
to
it
the
girls
crept
into
bed
careful
to
leave
their
candles
burning
you
know
billie
said
violet
in
an
awed
little
voice
this
thing
is
really
getting
serious
i
should
say
so
agreed
laura
drawing
the
bed
clothes
a
little
tighter
about
her
well
it
is
my
fault
is
it
asked
billie
i
did
ask
aunt
beatrice
to
leave
me
a
haunted
house
and
anyway
she
added
very
truthfully
it
was
you
laura
who
first
suggested
coming
here
yes
went
on
violet
accusingly
and
it
was
you
who
said
you
be
disappointed
if
you
did
see
a
ghost
or
two
laura
groaned
what
the
use
of
holding
things
up
against
me
that
i
said
when
i
was
young
and
foolish
she
asked
anyway
i
did
think
we
would
really
see
anything
well
we
have
said
billie
all
we
done
is
to
hear
things
but
we
heard
plenty
sighed
violet
there
what
that
the
girls
listened
feeling
almost
ready
to
scream
but
could
hear
nothing
but
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
the
tree
tops
only
the
wind
silly
said
laura
then
added
with
an
almost
comfortable
feeling
at
the
thought
gilligan
on
guard
anyway
yes
said
violet
adding
with
a
sigh
that
seemed
to
come
from
her
very
toes
i
only
hope
the
piano
does
swallow
her
up
before
morning
come
to
expect
almost
anything
chapter
xx
the
motor
again
the
piano
did
not
swallow
gilligan
up
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
good
woman
did
not
stand
guard
until
morning
half
an
hour
of
sitting
alone
in
that
gloomy
room
watching
a
piano
that
had
played
itself
was
enough
to
ruin
even
her
seasoned
nerves
once
back
in
her
room
she
scolded
herself
for
being
such
an
idiot
laughed
at
her
fears
and
being
a
normal
healthy
woman
fell
almost
instantly
to
sleep
in
the
morning
the
girls
themselves
felt
somewhat
inclined
to
laugh
at
the
fright
they
had
had
and
yet
they
knew
that
what
had
happened
had
been
no
figment
of
their
imaginations
the
sound
though
weird
and
eerie
had
been
real
even
gilligan
would
testify
to
that
well
i
tell
you
what
we
ought
to
do
said
ferd
as
he
sat
down
to
a
huge
plateful
of
breakfast
we
fellows
ought
to
take
turn
and
turn
about
keeping
watch
there
must
be
some
reason
for
the
noise
the
girls
heard
and
i
wo
be
happy
until
we
find
out
what
it
was
i
think
you
have
the
right
idea
replied
chet
decidedly
the
only
condition
i
make
is
that
i
be
allowed
to
stand
the
first
watch
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
any
of
you
broke
in
gilligan
with
that
slight
tightening
of
her
upper
lip
that
the
girls
and
boys
had
come
to
know
and
respect
that
a
fine
way
to
see
all
sorts
of
things
that
ai
and
hear
all
sorts
of
things
that
never
happened
sit
up
in
the
dark
waiting
for
something
to
happen
i
guess
not
but
we
ca
just
sit
back
and
let
the
piano
perform
like
that
every
night
can
we
asked
ferd
in
an
argumentative
tone
i
rather
stay
awake
part
of
the
night
than
all
of
it
do
you
even
want
to
solve
the
mystery
asked
chet
in
an
aggrieved
voice
mystery
humph
grunted
gilligan
feeling
very
brave
and
disdainful
in
the
bright
sunshine
i
do
believe
there
a
bit
of
mystery
in
the
whole
thing
then
what
made
the
piano
play
teddy
insisted
you
said
yourself
that
you
heard
it
oh
i
heard
it
all
right
said
gilligan
helping
herself
to
more
jam
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
but
i
have
an
idea
what
caused
it
all
right
oh
tell
us
they
cried
eagerly
but
their
chaperone
shook
her
head
determinedly
while
her
lip
became
still
tighter
no
indeed
i
wo
tell
you
she
said
adding
with
a
little
chuckle
i
want
to
try
it
out
myself
first
for
i
know
that
if
i
told
you
young
ones
about
it
you
only
laugh
and
i
do
like
being
laughed
at
but
we
would
laugh
billie
assured
her
earnestly
really
gilligan
we
promise
on
our
word
of
honor
not
to
so
much
as
even
smile
get
out
with
your
promises
said
gilligan
relapsing
into
her
brogue
i
do
be
knowing
you
better
i
try
it
she
added
graciously
and
if
it
does
work
i
tell
you
about
it
in
the
morning
i
suppose
here
where
i
spend
another
sleepless
night
said
violet
dolefully
helping
herself
to
more
biscuits
oh
well
i
getting
so
i
can
do
without
sleep
now
well
you
do
look
as
if
you
ever
lost
a
wink
in
your
life
said
chet
glancing
at
her
admiringly
for
it
was
an
open
secret
with
the
boys
and
girls
of
north
bend
that
chet
rather
especially
liked
tall
dark
violet
farrington
perhaps
because
she
was
so
much
like
himself
violet
blushed
prettily
at
this
complimentary
remark
and
the
girls
looked
at
her
teasingly
who
was
it
that
said
something
or
other
was
blind
asked
laura
wickedly
and
violet
kicked
her
under
the
table
peace
my
children
said
billie
we
having
enough
trouble
with
ghosts
and
things
without
starting
a
war
among
ourselves
who
have
some
more
jelly
there
was
a
simultaneous
shout
of
approval
and
the
jelly
dish
began
its
fourth
round
of
the
table
however
they
did
at
last
get
through
eating
and
wandered
out
on
the
front
porch
where
gilligan
could
not
scoff
at
their
ideas
to
discuss
the
doings
of
the
night
before
but
it
was
only
a
little
while
later
that
gilligan
put
another
damper
on
their
fun
by
announcing
that
some
one
would
have
to
go
to
town
for
more
provisions
the
boy
had
failed
to
come
that
morning
and
their
supply
of
canned
goods
was
running
dangerously
low
let
all
go
chet
suggested
we
could
walk
down
and
ride
back
but
oh
chet
it
so
frightfully
hot
billie
objected
i
sure
get
sunstroke
or
something
yes
it
a
terribly
long
walk
added
violet
well
we
could
wait
till
toward
evening
said
ferd
it
would
be
so
scorching
then
i
admit
he
added
taking
a
slanting
squint
at
the
sun
that
even
i
am
not
eager
to
take
a
long
hike
just
now
but
toward
evening
we
be
preparing
supper
objected
laura
and
the
boys
threw
up
their
hands
in
despair
well
then
we
just
have
to
go
without
you
said
teddy
but
it
would
be
lots
more
fun
if
you
come
this
last
was
said
to
billie
and
for
her
ear
alone
that
afternoon
the
girls
watched
the
boys
down
the
road
till
they
were
out
of
sight
then
turned
back
to
the
house
with
a
strangely
lonesome
feeling
you
know
said
violet
pausing
on
the
doorstep
and
looking
back
at
the
girls
with
a
rather
sober
face
i
have
a
sort
of
feeling
that
something
going
to
happen
well
you
better
get
rid
of
it
right
away
retorted
laura
we
want
anything
more
to
happen
especially
when
the
boys
are
away
this
time
violet
proved
to
be
right
something
did
happen
it
was
after
dark
the
boys
had
not
yet
got
back
from
the
village
and
the
girls
were
setting
the
table
in
the
kitchen
they
had
never
found
the
courage
to
eat
in
the
gloomy
when
violet
set
a
dish
down
on
the
table
with
a
bang
that
made
the
girls
start
and
look
at
her
in
surprise
as
for
violet
she
was
too
scared
to
speak
for
a
moment
then
she
stammered
out
the
strange
motor
car
she
said
while
billie
and
laura
stared
at
her
i
thought
i
heard
it
before
cried
billie
and
they
listened
hardly
daring
to
breathe
there
was
the
same
strange
humming
sound
that
had
so
startled
them
on
their
first
night
in
the
house
only
this
time
instead
of
coming
from
a
distance
and
passing
by
the
noise
seemed
to
get
louder
then
softer
louder
and
softer
as
if
whatever
it
was
were
approaching
and
retreating
at
regular
intervals
at
that
moment
gilligan
came
into
the
room
and
the
girls
called
to
her
to
listen
also
that
she
asked
with
a
little
laugh
why
that
an
automobile
of
course
and
started
for
the
front
door
only
i
must
say
it
behaving
mighty
queer
but
when
they
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
rocky
road
there
was
no
sign
of
an
automobile
and
yet
the
humming
sound
still
kept
on
as
they
listened
the
noise
grew
softer
and
softer
and
gradually
died
away
in
the
distance
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
wonderingly
then
it
was
billie
who
offered
a
solution
might
it
be
an
aeroplane
an
aeroplane
in
this
part
of
the
country
laura
was
inclined
to
scoff
at
the
idea
but
gilligan
and
violet
both
stood
up
for
billie
they
were
about
to
enter
into
a
heated
argument
when
they
saw
the
wagon
that
had
by
this
time
become
familiar
to
them
coming
down
the
road
with
the
boys
seated
in
it
or
hanging
to
it
in
characteristic
attitudes
the
girls
ran
out
to
them
and
deluged
the
lads
with
questions
before
they
had
time
to
learn
what
it
was
all
about
a
motor
car
asked
chet
no
we
did
pass
a
soul
on
the
way
up
here
when
the
girls
had
poured
into
their
interested
ears
the
story
of
the
queer
humming
sound
that
had
just
repeated
itself
they
agreed
to
one
man
to
billie
suggestion
that
it
was
very
probably
an
aeroplane
i
tell
you
what
we
do
next
time
we
hear
it
said
teddy
as
the
boys
picked
up
the
provisions
they
had
brought
and
started
toward
the
house
we
go
up
on
the
roof
then
we
pretty
soon
see
whether
a
ghost
or
the
real
thing
and
in
the
meantime
suggested
chet
sniffing
the
air
hungrily
how
about
some
supper
chapter
xxi
both
at
once
it
was
not
long
before
there
came
a
recurrence
of
the
strange
humming
noise
which
had
so
disturbed
the
girls
it
was
only
a
few
nights
later
that
chet
sat
up
in
bed
with
the
joyful
feeling
that
here
at
last
was
a
chance
to
investigate
at
least
one
of
the
ghosts
that
haunted
the
homestead
at
cherry
corners
ferd
teddy
wake
up
what
the
matter
are
you
dead
he
called
to
the
boys
the
latter
reluctantly
opened
their
eyes
and
looked
at
him
reproachfully
ca
you
let
a
fellow
sleep
teddy
asked
but
chet
with
no
ceremony
whatever
hauled
him
bodily
out
of
bed
and
set
him
on
his
feet
do
talk
he
ordered
run
as
fast
as
you
can
to
the
roof
before
we
miss
it
what
are
you
raving
about
asked
ferd
although
both
he
and
teddy
started
obediently
toward
the
attic
stairs
if
you
would
talk
so
much
you
could
hear
it
chet
answered
pushing
up
a
trap
door
that
led
to
a
small
square
platform
on
the
roof
the
motor
sound
the
girls
heard
and
that
scared
them
so
it
is
for
a
fact
cried
teddy
in
a
joyful
whisper
and
it
coming
right
near
fellows
too
it
an
aeroplane
all
right
said
ferd
with
conviction
nothing
else
ever
made
a
noise
like
that
say
what
are
you
doing
up
there
a
girl
voice
hailed
them
from
the
bottom
of
the
steps
and
chet
thought
he
recognized
it
as
billie
are
you
walking
in
your
sleep
or
have
you
gone
crazy
come
down
here
quick
we
need
you
keep
still
chet
yelled
back
we
looking
for
your
aeroplane
ghost
ca
you
hear
it
yes
but
oh
chet
billie
voice
was
tremulous
the
piano
is
playing
itself
again
wo
you
come
down
we
afraid
to
stay
here
all
alone
great
scott
all
the
spirits
are
roaming
at
once
cried
teddy
straining
his
eyes
to
see
through
the
darkness
as
the
humming
of
the
motor
came
nearer
there
is
that
it
cried
ferd
pointing
eagerly
through
the
trees
toward
a
little
patch
of
sky
palely
illumined
with
stars
i
think
i
saw
it
said
chet
rubbing
his
eyes
impatiently
it
so
confoundedly
dark
oh
wo
you
please
come
down
wailed
billie
voice
from
the
spooky
depths
of
the
attic
i
die
of
fright
if
i
have
to
stay
here
another
minute
this
appeal
moved
the
boys
and
they
began
reluctantly
to
descend
the
ladder
keeping
their
eyes
all
the
time
on
the
pale
patch
of
sky
where
are
the
others
asked
teddy
as
he
reached
billie
side
they
down
looking
for
the
ghost
answered
billie
as
she
ran
down
the
stairs
in
front
of
them
they
sent
me
to
get
you
boys
and
i
found
you
gone
gilligan
she
added
with
a
hysterical
giggle
has
the
broom
and
laura
has
the
poker
maybe
we
better
stop
on
the
way
and
gather
up
a
few
bedposts
suggested
ferd
as
they
took
the
last
flight
of
stairs
on
a
run
and
landed
in
the
lower
hall
hello
did
you
find
anything
sang
out
chet
as
the
girls
looking
scared
but
valiant
came
out
to
meet
them
where
mrs
gilligan
inside
said
violet
there
is
a
thing
to
be
seen
any
more
than
there
was
the
other
night
i
absolutely
positive
now
that
it
must
be
a
ghost
well
if
it
is
he
got
a
sense
of
humor
said
gilligan
rising
from
her
knees
where
she
had
been
peering
into
the
corner
behind
the
piano
i
heard
of
all
sorts
of
spirits
but
i
never
heard
of
one
who
insisted
upon
playing
the
piano
in
the
dead
of
night
he
must
have
been
a
musician
in
his
life
time
suggested
chet
the
reason
he
comes
and
haunts
the
piano
well
i
do
see
why
he
does
choose
a
regular
piano
to
haunt
said
billie
feeling
irritable
because
she
was
very
sleepy
and
had
been
very
much
frightened
it
bad
enough
for
a
live
person
to
play
let
alone
a
ghost
and
where
could
it
have
gone
wondered
laura
her
eyes
big
and
dark
with
excitement
the
minute
we
heard
the
noise
i
guess
we
sort
of
listening
for
it
even
in
our
sleep
we
jumped
up
and
came
down
here
while
billie
went
to
call
you
boys
it
was
playing
almost
up
to
the
minute
we
came
into
the
room
and
maybe
we
were
afraid
to
go
in
said
violet
with
a
shudder
i
do
know
how
we
ever
got
the
courage
well
you
only
came
because
gilligan
and
i
went
ahead
with
the
broom
and
the
poker
sniffed
laura
was
it
playing
when
you
came
down
the
stairs
asked
chet
interested
and
did
it
stop
as
soon
as
you
entered
the
room
yes
it
was
gilligan
who
answered
this
time
and
it
was
good
for
him
he
did
i
lost
enough
sleep
through
the
miserable
rascal
and
i
was
just
ripe
for
a
tussle
i
do
blame
him
for
running
said
teddy
with
a
chuckle
but
where
did
he
go
asked
laura
again
we
were
sure
that
we
see
something
goodness
knows
what
when
we
turned
the
corner
of
the
room
and
all
we
saw
was
a
a
large
amount
of
nothing
at
all
added
violet
perhaps
suggested
ferd
with
a
chuckle
the
aeroplane
we
heard
belonged
to
him
a
ghost
aeroplane
murmured
billie
smothering
another
hysterical
chuckle
and
when
you
girls
came
in
he
just
soared
skyward
and
went
off
in
it
it
funny
we
never
thought
of
that
said
teddy
scornfully
well
i
wish
we
could
find
out
what
it
is
sighed
billie
as
they
started
upstairs
again
this
staying
awake
all
night
is
very
much
fun
but
is
it
strange
asked
laura
stopping
on
the
landing
and
looking
back
at
them
that
both
the
piano
and
the
motor
should
start
again
on
the
same
night
yes
it
is
rather
said
chet
adding
seriously
i
wonder
if
there
could
really
be
any
connection
between
the
two
there
no
use
wondering
that
i
can
see
said
gilligan
preparing
to
send
them
off
to
their
respective
bedrooms
i
think
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
not
to
notice
them
any
more
perhaps
the
ghosts
will
get
tired
if
they
find
they
do
worry
us
this
last
with
a
chuckle
well
but
they
do
worry
us
said
violet
plaintively
every
time
i
hear
that
piano
i
just
about
die
of
fright
listen
commanded
billie
and
as
they
listened
they
heard
it
again
the
ghost
or
whatever
it
was
was
surely
making
a
joke
of
them
that
night
as
soon
as
the
boys
could
recover
from
their
surprise
they
tumbled
down
the
stairs
tripping
over
each
other
in
their
hurry
while
the
girls
followed
more
slowly
but
again
the
noise
stopped
abruptly
and
when
they
entered
the
room
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
or
heard
say
this
thing
is
making
me
mad
cried
ferd
glaring
at
the
old
piano
as
though
it
were
the
offender
i
do
mind
meeting
an
ghost
but
i
be
hanged
if
i
let
him
laugh
at
me
i
do
see
how
you
going
to
help
it
said
teddy
come
on
fellows
it
pretty
nearly
morning
and
we
can
decide
then
what
we
do
to
catch
ghost
i
so
sleepy
i
apt
to
fall
asleep
on
my
feet
so
they
went
upstairs
again
feeling
rather
miserable
and
dragged
out
with
excitement
and
crawled
into
bed
if
this
thing
keeps
up
much
longer
i
just
be
a
wreck
that
all
groaned
laura
and
almost
immediately
she
fell
asleep
after
a
little
while
of
staring
into
the
dark
billie
and
violet
followed
her
example
and
once
more
there
was
quiet
in
the
old
house
nothing
more
disturbed
them
but
they
woke
the
next
morning
tired
and
cross
and
with
a
decidedly
morning
after
feeling
i
do
want
to
get
up
complained
violet
turning
restlessly
in
bed
and
punching
her
pillow
i
ca
get
more
than
one
eye
open
shall
we
send
for
the
doctor
asked
billie
regarding
her
sleepily
that
sounds
like
a
serious
complaint
humph
i
do
need
a
doctor
grumbled
violet
i
can
prescribe
for
my
case
better
than
he
could
what
i
need
is
a
rest
cure
so
say
we
all
of
us
echoed
laura
sleepily
i
going
to
take
another
nap
girls
and
if
anybody
dares
to
wake
me
up
i
throw
my
hair
brush
at
them
i
going
to
get
up
decided
billie
i
only
get
a
headache
lying
here
well
i
hope
you
enjoy
yourself
said
laura
and
settled
herself
in
a
still
more
comfortable
position
while
billie
was
dressing
the
two
girls
fell
asleep
again
and
as
she
turned
to
look
at
them
she
almost
wished
that
she
had
followed
their
example
but
i
knew
i
could
sleep
she
said
turning
away
and
besides
getting
very
hungry
but
when
she
started
down
the
broad
staircase
she
found
that
she
was
the
only
one
stirring
in
the
house
and
a
strange
lonesome
feeling
took
possession
of
her
ugh
she
cried
glancing
about
her
distastefully
it
the
gloomiest
place
i
ever
did
see
i
be
glad
when
we
leave
it
that
is
i
would
be
she
added
wistfully
if
only
chet
and
i
were
going
with
the
others
to
boarding
school
she
wandered
into
the
room
where
the
old
piano
stood
and
looked
at
it
musingly
for
a
few
minutes
then
suddenly
a
thought
struck
her
and
she
clapped
her
hands
gleefully
i
wonder
she
said
then
remembering
an
old
rat
trap
that
she
had
come
across
several
days
ago
ran
into
the
pantry
to
get
it
she
baited
it
with
a
fresh
piece
of
cheese
and
set
it
carefully
on
the
piano
now
she
said
standing
back
and
regarding
her
work
with
satisfaction
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
chapter
xxii
a
thrilling
discovery
it
was
ten
before
the
girls
finally
came
down
and
it
was
still
later
before
the
boys
appeared
gilligan
and
billie
had
had
breakfast
together
and
billie
had
confided
to
the
older
woman
her
suspicions
in
regard
to
the
ghostly
player
of
the
old
piano
but
we
wo
tell
the
boys
and
girls
billie
had
said
with
a
delightful
sense
of
conspiracy
we
wait
and
see
if
it
works
as
the
young
people
came
in
looking
famished
gilligan
rose
and
put
some
cold
muffins
in
the
oven
to
heat
you
wo
get
very
much
to
eat
she
warned
them
billie
and
i
had
our
breakfast
at
a
respectable
hour
and
now
you
got
to
take
what
left
i
do
care
what
you
give
us
as
long
as
it
food
said
ferd
looking
about
him
anxiously
i
just
about
starved
to
death
it
seems
to
me
i
heard
that
remark
somewhere
before
said
billie
laughing
at
him
hurry
up
and
eat
you
folks
she
added
as
she
set
a
dish
of
fried
hominy
before
them
we
girls
have
really
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
attic
yet
and
i
just
dying
to
poke
into
all
the
corners
yes
i
always
did
like
attics
said
laura
adding
as
she
swallowed
a
delicious
morsel
but
i
like
fried
hominy
more
wo
you
come
too
violet
asked
the
boys
as
their
breakfast
over
the
girls
started
up
to
the
attic
we
love
to
have
you
and
you
might
find
it
interesting
no
thanks
said
teddy
decidedly
i
can
think
of
lots
better
things
to
do
than
go
roaming
about
a
hot
old
attic
when
the
thermometer
is
in
the
shade
i
going
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
how
about
it
fellows
yes
and
see
if
we
can
come
across
those
old
fellows
with
the
beards
that
told
us
the
story
chuckled
chet
you
know
he
added
i
have
wondered
several
times
since
then
what
the
old
fellows
were
up
to
somehow
i
mighty
sure
they
did
tell
the
truth
i
tell
you
what
cried
ferd
eagerly
let
push
on
in
the
direction
we
were
going
the
other
day
and
see
what
being
pulled
off
in
there
yes
and
get
shot
most
likely
sniffed
laura
i
do
think
much
of
that
idea
well
we
did
ask
you
to
come
did
we
ferd
asked
no
and
i
do
think
it
was
very
nice
of
you
after
we
invited
you
to
our
party
violet
put
in
trying
to
look
aggrieved
oh
please
wo
you
come
with
us
asked
ferd
bowing
elaborately
before
her
laura
gave
him
a
little
push
which
precipitated
him
in
a
rather
abrupt
manner
into
a
chair
and
completely
spoiled
his
gallantry
i
get
even
with
you
he
threatened
during
the
laugh
that
followed
at
his
expense
but
say
fellows
you
have
answered
my
question
are
you
game
sure
we
game
they
answered
and
chet
added
as
he
picked
up
a
stick
he
had
found
in
the
woods
several
days
before
and
had
modeled
into
an
excellent
club
if
they
start
any
funny
business
they
find
me
ready
for
them
oh
boys
do
be
careful
billie
begged
really
afraid
that
their
love
of
adventure
would
get
them
into
trouble
i
did
like
the
looks
of
those
men
and
they
had
clubs
maybe
said
violet
in
an
awed
voice
maybe
they
what
do
you
call
them
the
fellows
that
make
whiskey
moonshiners
teddy
helped
her
out
and
the
boys
shouted
with
laughter
all
the
more
reason
why
we
should
find
them
out
said
ferd
as
they
started
from
the
room
it
our
duty
he
turned
in
the
doorway
to
make
them
a
bow
to
turn
them
over
to
justice
it
must
be
a
disease
laughed
billie
as
the
girls
ascended
the
old
staircase
together
well
i
hope
they
live
through
it
added
laura
with
a
chuckle
i
found
a
funny
old
closet
yesterday
said
billie
as
they
came
out
into
the
musty
attic
i
was
just
going
to
open
it
and
see
what
was
inside
when
you
girls
called
me
for
something
here
it
is
indicating
a
small
door
the
top
of
which
was
only
on
a
level
with
their
shoulders
i
never
saw
so
many
queer
things
in
one
place
in
my
life
said
laura
peering
down
as
billie
opened
the
door
i
did
know
they
grew
that
way
we
have
to
stoop
down
to
get
in
here
said
billie
poking
her
head
into
the
stuffy
dark
hole
disclosed
and
look
girls
she
exclaimed
excitedly
as
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
gloom
the
closet
runs
away
back
an
awfully
long
way
and
there
seems
to
be
something
bulky
at
the
other
end
of
it
well
let
go
in
said
laura
giving
billie
an
impatient
little
push
we
ca
find
anything
by
standing
here
billie
what
the
matter
for
billie
had
started
back
so
suddenly
that
she
had
almost
thrown
laura
off
her
balance
it
another
of
those
horrid
old
bats
she
gasped
bending
down
as
an
indistinct
little
shape
fluttered
past
her
i
should
think
they
could
live
in
the
closet
without
air
or
anything
to
eat
it
probably
flew
in
when
you
opened
the
door
the
other
day
violet
suggested
once
more
billie
bent
down
and
felt
her
way
into
the
narrow
closet
do
try
to
stand
up
girls
she
cautioned
you
apt
to
get
an
awful
bump
on
the
head
i
already
had
one
said
violet
rubbing
the
bumped
spot
tenderly
goodness
it
smells
musty
in
here
girls
it
a
trunk
cried
billie
leaning
down
to
examine
the
bulky
object
she
had
seen
at
the
other
end
a
pretty
big
one
too
and
oh
as
she
attempted
to
lift
one
end
awfully
heavy
a
trunk
laura
repeated
excitedly
that
sounds
interesting
ca
you
pull
it
out
billie
i
try
replied
billie
adding
with
a
chuckle
but
i
should
wonder
if
you
girls
would
have
to
help
by
pulling
me
my
but
it
heavy
however
after
much
hauling
and
pulling
billie
finally
succeeded
in
backing
out
of
the
closet
pulling
the
trunk
after
her
then
standing
up
and
brushing
the
hair
out
of
her
eyes
she
regarded
it
gleefully
everything
in
the
house
is
mine
she
reminded
them
as
she
stooped
down
again
to
examine
the
lock
so
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
look
in
anything
i
find
well
nobody
arguing
about
that
said
laura
sitting
down
on
the
floor
regardless
of
a
fine
coating
of
dust
and
helping
billie
in
her
examination
has
it
any
key
asked
violet
eagerly
of
course
not
silly
laura
answered
what
would
be
the
use
of
a
locked
trunk
if
you
kept
the
key
around
where
everybody
could
see
it
well
i
did
even
know
it
was
locked
violet
said
rather
heatedly
for
her
billie
jumped
to
her
feet
and
gave
the
trunk
a
sudden
jerk
girls
she
cried
did
you
hear
that
hear
what
they
chorused
eagerly
but
did
you
hear
it
rattle
when
we
pulled
it
out
of
the
closet
i
thought
so
then
now
i
sure
oh
girls
what
is
the
matter
billie
i
jerked
the
trunk
explained
billie
while
the
color
tinged
her
face
and
it
jingled
yes
it
did
it
actually
jingled
billie
cried
laura
looking
and
awed
do
you
mean
it
sounded
like
for
answer
billie
reached
down
and
gave
the
trunk
another
jerk
sure
enough
there
was
the
unmistakable
jingle
of
metal
against
metal
as
though
the
trunk
were
filled
with
coins
their
hearts
beating
fast
hardly
able
to
speak
with
excitement
the
girls
stood
and
stared
down
at
this
new
discovery
i
i
feel
like
captain
kidd
gasped
billie
her
cheeks
crimson
now
like
captain
kidd
when
he
found
the
treasure
girls
do
you
really
think
it
money
it
certainly
sounds
like
it
said
violet
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
excitement
as
she
reached
down
and
gave
the
trunk
another
jerk
just
for
the
fun
of
hearing
its
contents
jingle
well
let
get
it
downstairs
suggested
laura
wildly
impatient
to
see
the
treasure
if
treasure
it
were
we
certainly
ca
open
it
ourselves
without
a
key
oh
if
the
boys
were
only
at
home
she
added
with
an
impatient
little
stamp
of
her
foot
it
seems
to
me
they
never
around
when
you
want
them
maybe
we
can
call
them
back
they
have
had
time
to
go
far
said
billie
stirred
to
instant
action
by
the
thought
come
on
laura
you
take
one
end
vi
can
steady
it
at
the
side
and
we
at
least
get
the
trunk
downstairs
that
the
way
now
then
after
a
good
deal
of
pushing
and
lugging
and
a
spasm
of
fright
when
the
trunk
almost
fell
on
laura
they
finally
succeeded
in
getting
their
burden
down
to
the
second
floor
there
the
girls
left
it
and
started
hastily
down
the
stairs
in
pursuit
of
the
boys
they
had
gone
only
half
the
way
however
when
they
were
startled
by
a
tremendous
crash
and
explosion
outside
and
stood
still
their
hearts
in
their
mouths
oh
now
what
has
happened
cried
violet
as
they
rushed
down
the
rest
of
the
steps
and
started
for
the
front
door
half
way
to
the
door
gilligan
met
them
holding
a
rat
trap
in
her
hand
from
which
hung
suspended
a
dead
rat
where
did
you
get
that
the
girls
cried
in
chorus
it
rat
the
piano
player
said
gilligan
adding
as
she
pushed
past
them
and
ran
to
the
door
did
you
hear
that
awful
noise
outside
girls
did
we
hear
it
they
cried
following
her
oh
gilligan
what
do
you
suppose
it
was
asked
violet
pressing
close
to
her
somebody
is
probably
hurt
answered
the
woman
adding
as
though
to
herself
terribly
hurt
hope
it
ai
the
boys
chapter
xxiii
the
wrecked
aeroplane
the
girls
never
remembered
very
clearly
what
happened
after
that
they
had
a
vague
and
confused
recollection
of
seeing
the
boys
gathered
around
something
in
the
bushes
at
the
brook
that
groaned
a
little
and
made
queer
sputtering
noises
then
the
boys
bent
down
and
began
extricating
the
groaning
thing
from
the
wreck
of
something
chet
what
is
it
cried
billie
with
an
impression
that
she
was
living
a
dream
she
tried
to
push
past
him
but
her
brother
stopped
her
stay
away
sis
he
ordered
the
poor
fellow
hurt
we
do
know
how
badly
and
i
rather
you
would
go
back
to
the
house
but
if
he
hurt
there
all
the
more
need
for
us
insisted
billie
sudden
decision
in
her
voice
we
know
first
aid
let
us
past
boys
not
exactly
knowing
why
they
obeyed
her
the
boys
drew
aside
and
she
ran
to
the
side
of
the
prostrate
figure
on
the
ground
the
other
girls
following
half
reluctantly
the
boys
had
succeeded
in
removing
the
man
from
the
wreckage
one
glance
about
them
told
the
girls
that
the
wreck
had
once
been
an
aeroplane
and
the
man
who
was
elderly
lay
quite
still
looking
up
at
them
with
sick
eyes
oh
ca
we
get
him
up
to
the
house
cried
billie
clasping
her
hands
in
pity
and
looking
appealingly
at
gilligan
then
we
can
send
for
a
doctor
but
it
was
the
hurt
man
himself
who
interrupted
i
i
all
in
he
said
speaking
with
great
effort
it
wo
do
any
good
to
move
me
but
it
might
cried
violet
coming
down
and
leaning
compassionately
over
him
while
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
do
you
think
it
would
hurt
too
much
come
on
let
try
it
fellows
said
teddy
speaking
with
sudden
decision
we
ca
leave
him
here
to
die
perhaps
he
added
softly
we
can
at
least
make
an
attempt
to
save
his
life
he
bent
down
and
putting
a
hand
under
each
of
the
man
arms
lifted
him
slightly
eliciting
a
moan
of
pain
you
take
his
feet
chet
and
ferd
you
support
his
back
he
directed
now
then
the
boys
started
to
obey
but
at
the
first
touch
the
man
cried
out
in
such
pain
that
they
were
forced
to
put
him
down
again
it
something
in
here
said
the
old
fellow
while
the
girls
and
boys
stood
looking
helplessly
at
him
not
knowing
what
to
do
he
put
a
hand
over
his
left
side
something
broken
i
i
was
trying
to
invent
a
new
kind
of
aeroplane
he
went
on
jerkily
and
in
spite
of
the
tragic
circumstances
the
young
folks
felt
a
thrill
of
excitement
as
they
realized
that
here
perhaps
was
the
secret
of
that
strange
humming
noise
that
had
so
badly
frightened
and
bewildered
them
the
second
ghost
murmured
teddy
softly
as
though
to
himself
but
billie
standing
close
beside
him
heard
a
new
kind
of
aeroplane
chet
prompted
gently
but
with
an
unusual
light
in
his
eye
yes
and
this
was
its
trial
flight
the
old
man
said
with
a
world
of
bitterness
in
his
voice
the
engine
exploded
i
guess
it
shows
that
pretty
much
of
a
failure
in
every
way
i
do
see
why
cried
billie
her
warm
heart
eager
to
give
him
comfort
there
may
have
been
just
some
little
thing
the
matter
that
you
what
that
that
was
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
a
crackling
of
bushes
and
the
next
minute
two
men
burst
out
into
the
clearing
they
were
red
of
face
and
breathless
and
when
they
saw
the
old
man
and
the
wrecked
machine
they
stood
stock
still
and
stared
in
consternation
with
a
start
the
girls
and
boys
recognized
the
men
as
those
whom
they
had
met
in
the
woods
that
other
day
not
so
long
ago
the
men
who
had
so
curtly
ordered
them
to
go
the
other
way
so
the
corn
story
was
a
fish
story
after
all
and
the
old
vain
attempt
to
make
a
new
kind
of
flying
machine
was
the
key
to
all
the
mystery
are
you
very
much
hurt
dad
cried
the
younger
of
the
two
men
leaning
anxiously
over
the
old
man
again
the
young
folks
were
startled
so
one
of
the
bearded
men
was
the
old
man
son
all
in
son
i
guess
answered
the
old
man
with
a
sigh
he
laid
his
hand
over
his
left
side
and
whispered
i
all
smashed
to
pieces
the
engine
exploded
well
let
see
about
that
said
the
second
of
the
two
men
pushing
the
younger
aside
and
beginning
to
rip
open
the
old
man
shirt
up
to
that
time
neither
of
the
men
had
thrown
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
wondering
boys
and
girls
in
fact
they
gave
every
impression
of
not
having
seen
them
at
all
the
older
of
the
two
men
was
working
feverishly
he
seemed
to
be
a
doctor
judging
from
the
skill
with
which
he
tapped
here
and
pressed
there
evidently
trying
to
find
out
what
bones
were
broken
if
any
and
all
the
time
the
old
inventor
kept
up
a
feeble
moaning
he
must
be
very
much
hurt
indeed
or
very
very
old
thought
billie
as
with
one
hand
clasped
tightly
in
laura
and
the
other
gripping
violet
arm
she
watched
intently
why
this
is
so
bad
after
all
announced
the
man
at
last
looking
up
from
his
patient
with
a
light
in
his
eyes
that
made
him
look
very
boyish
in
spite
of
the
beard
on
his
face
your
father
terribly
bruised
and
battered
up
stanton
he
said
addressing
the
old
man
son
who
had
been
looking
on
with
strained
attention
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
only
bones
broken
are
a
rib
or
two
we
soon
fix
you
up
as
good
as
new
he
went
on
turning
again
to
the
old
man
the
latter
looked
surprised
and
left
off
moaning
you
mean
i
going
to
live
he
asked
incredulously
adding
with
a
faint
little
attempt
at
a
smile
why
why
i
was
sure
i
was
done
for
no
indeed
said
the
as
billie
had
already
dubbed
him
rising
briskly
to
his
feet
you
live
to
fly
many
another
aeroplane
parsons
now
will
you
let
your
son
and
me
take
you
home
such
is
the
power
of
mind
over
matter
the
inventor
hardly
made
any
outcry
at
all
when
his
son
and
the
lifted
him
between
them
and
started
off
through
the
woods
as
he
turned
about
the
doctor
eyes
rested
on
the
boys
and
girls
and
he
stopped
short
apparently
really
seeing
them
for
the
first
time
hello
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
scarcely
noticed
you
adding
more
by
way
of
explanation
than
excuse
you
see
i
was
very
much
occupied
oh
we
do
mind
said
billie
truthfully
adding
as
the
doctor
turned
toward
her
is
there
anything
we
can
do
to
help
the
the
inventor
oh
so
he
told
you
then
said
the
doctor
with
a
vexed
frown
no
thanks
there
nothing
you
can
do
we
be
back
for
the
pieces
of
the
aeroplane
later
and
without
another
glance
the
strange
trio
disappeared
into
the
woods
for
a
long
minute
the
boys
and
girls
stood
staring
after
the
strange
men
dazedly
then
they
turned
to
each
other
with
a
sigh
well
said
laura
explosively
if
everything
is
happening
to
us
at
once
then
my
name
is
laura
jordon
to
think
that
our
ghost
turned
out
to
be
an
inventor
after
all
you
look
as
if
you
were
disappointed
gibed
ferd
beginning
to
recover
from
his
bewilderment
we
manufacture
a
brand
new
ghost
if
you
say
so
but
it
may
take
time
goodness
you
need
bother
said
violet
going
over
to
the
wrecked
machine
and
regarding
it
wonderingly
we
had
enough
of
ghosts
to
last
us
a
lifetime
my
that
poor
old
inventor
must
have
had
a
terrible
fall
it
a
miracle
said
teddy
who
had
joined
her
and
was
looking
down
at
the
wreck
soberly
that
he
ever
came
out
alive
i
agreed
with
him
at
first
that
he
was
all
in
well
let
it
be
a
lesson
to
you
said
chet
with
mock
gravity
never
to
let
your
ambitions
soar
to
aeroplane
inventing
if
that
meant
to
be
a
joke
said
laura
bitingly
i
must
say
it
as
much
of
a
failure
as
our
old
inventor
himself
well
girls
she
added
turning
back
to
them
i
do
suppose
there
any
use
staying
around
here
any
longer
let
go
back
to
the
house
it
was
not
till
they
were
entering
the
grim
old
door
of
the
grim
old
house
that
they
thought
again
of
billie
new
discovery
the
trunk
that
jingled
goodness
how
could
we
ever
have
forgotten
it
cried
billie
as
she
with
violet
and
laura
fairly
flew
up
the
stairs
leaving
the
bewildered
boys
to
follow
them
now
what
up
asked
teddy
as
he
came
into
the
room
where
the
girls
had
left
their
treasure
so
many
things
are
happening
all
at
once
that
it
enough
to
make
a
fellow
brain
reel
it
all
depends
on
the
brain
said
billie
looking
up
at
him
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
and
all
teddy
did
was
to
look
sad
and
reproachful
say
what
shall
i
be
doin
with
this
asked
gilligan
and
they
turned
to
see
her
great
bulk
looming
in
the
doorway
in
her
hand
she
held
the
rat
trap
with
the
dangling
rat
gee
where
did
you
get
it
cried
chet
jumping
to
his
feet
from
where
he
had
been
kneeling
with
billie
examining
the
shabby
trunk
gilligan
paused
a
moment
and
a
gleam
of
humor
shot
into
her
eyes
you
been
askin
to
see
ghosts
chet
she
said
with
a
chuckle
and
you
sure
have
got
your
wish
this
day
that
airman
was
the
first
here
is
the
second
one
chapter
xxiv
coins
and
postage
stamps
chet
looked
bewildered
for
a
minute
then
disgusted
an
expression
that
was
faithfully
reflected
on
the
faces
of
the
other
boys
a
ghost
that
he
said
pointing
scornfully
at
the
dead
rat
what
do
you
mean
oh
chet
cried
billie
springing
to
her
feet
in
her
turn
another
thing
we
forgot
this
is
rat
the
piano
player
have
you
all
gone
crazy
or
have
i
cried
poor
chet
looking
still
more
bewildered
but
suddenly
teddy
saw
light
you
mean
the
musical
ghost
he
cried
laughter
in
his
voice
the
one
that
has
had
us
chasing
down
flights
of
stairs
on
dark
nights
with
the
chills
running
up
and
down
our
spines
and
our
hair
standing
on
end
added
ferd
following
his
lead
the
very
same
responded
gilligan
the
gleam
deepening
in
her
eyes
but
how
did
you
catch
it
asked
violet
for
the
girls
all
except
billie
who
had
originated
the
idea
were
as
much
in
the
dark
as
the
boys
with
a
trap
said
billie
her
own
eyes
beginning
to
sparkle
but
who
thought
of
it
violet
insisted
ignoring
the
sarcasm
you
see
before
you
the
girl
who
invented
it
said
billie
with
a
chuckle
great
pumpkins
another
inventor
groaned
ferd
and
sent
them
off
into
a
spasm
of
laughter
oh
tell
us
about
it
billie
laura
entreated
you
can
be
the
most
aggravating
thing
stop
calling
me
names
or
i
never
tell
you
threatened
billie
at
which
laura
looked
as
meek
as
laura
could
ever
look
thereupon
billie
recounted
to
an
interested
audience
the
events
that
had
led
to
her
idea
that
it
might
be
a
rat
that
was
making
a
joke
of
them
all
and
how
she
had
decided
to
put
her
idea
to
the
test
say
think
of
getting
excited
about
a
mouse
cried
ferd
incredulously
when
she
had
finished
it
was
a
mouse
it
was
a
rat
corrected
billie
but
it
might
have
been
a
mouse
ferd
protested
but
billie
broke
in
again
no
it
might
she
said
decidedly
a
mouse
could
never
have
made
noise
enough
for
us
to
hear
when
we
were
upstairs
in
bed
right
you
are
said
ferd
taking
off
an
imaginary
cap
to
billie
i
have
to
hand
it
to
you
billie
you
right
there
you
said
it
that
time
old
man
murmured
teddy
very
softly
but
billie
heard
him
and
looked
up
at
him
with
laughing
eyes
come
help
us
open
our
trunk
she
said
turning
away
suddenly
whose
trunk
is
it
where
did
you
get
it
looks
as
if
it
had
come
out
of
noah
ark
these
and
many
more
comments
piled
one
on
top
of
the
other
as
the
boys
looked
at
the
old
trunk
which
did
indeed
appear
old
enough
to
have
satisfied
the
most
ardent
collector
of
antiques
why
it
my
trunk
said
billie
when
she
could
make
herself
heard
above
the
babble
we
found
it
in
the
attic
but
i
do
see
what
difference
it
makes
where
we
got
it
she
added
impatiently
getting
down
on
her
knees
once
more
and
shaking
the
trunk
as
if
it
were
to
blame
wo
you
please
get
busy
and
open
it
boys
are
you
a
bit
curious
to
see
what
inside
is
there
a
key
asked
ferd
and
billie
looked
up
at
him
in
despair
of
course
not
silly
she
said
do
you
suppose
we
have
had
it
open
ages
ago
if
there
had
been
a
key
you
have
to
break
it
open
or
pick
the
lock
or
something
say
she
insulting
us
thinks
we
thugs
murmured
ferd
as
he
with
the
other
boys
got
down
on
the
floor
and
began
to
examine
the
trunk
eagerly
yes
where
do
you
suppose
we
got
our
experience
in
picking
locks
added
chet
looking
aggrieved
goodness
i
do
care
whether
you
pick
the
lock
or
what
you
do
as
long
as
you
get
it
open
cried
billie
half
wild
with
impatience
now
that
the
fateful
moment
had
arrived
you
can
use
dynamite
for
all
i
care
maybe
that
what
in
it
suggested
teddy
and
the
girls
screamed
teddy
of
all
the
wet
blankets
well
you
never
can
tell
said
teddy
adding
wickedly
as
ferd
started
to
set
the
trunk
on
end
be
careful
there
ferd
she
may
explode
as
the
aeroplane
did
somebody
give
me
something
to
throw
at
him
cried
laura
indignantly
anyway
she
added
triumphantly
we
know
there
is
dynamite
in
it
or
we
have
been
blown
to
bits
long
ago
we
dragged
it
down
stairs
yes
and
we
did
do
it
very
gently
either
added
violet
it
has
a
pretty
strong
lock
said
chet
getting
to
his
feet
and
rumpling
up
his
hair
thoughtfully
i
have
to
get
a
hammer
and
a
wedge
of
some
sort
oh
there
are
all
sorts
of
tools
down
in
the
billie
cried
eagerly
and
chet
looked
at
her
as
though
she
had
said
she
had
discovered
a
gold
mine
in
the
back
yard
tools
he
repeated
his
eyes
shining
are
they
good
ones
i
do
know
anything
about
tools
said
billie
but
it
looked
as
if
there
were
hundreds
of
them
chet
waited
to
hear
no
more
like
a
streak
of
lightning
he
was
out
of
the
room
and
racing
down
the
stairs
tools
he
was
saying
gloatingly
to
himself
hundreds
of
them
upstairs
billie
turned
and
looked
at
teddy
in
dismay
now
what
have
i
done
she
cried
if
he
once
gets
among
those
tools
we
wo
see
him
for
hours
teddy
and
she
looked
appealing
enough
even
to
melt
teddy
hard
heart
wo
you
go
after
him
you
will
have
to
just
tear
him
away
however
the
two
boys
were
back
sooner
than
the
girls
expected
for
they
were
very
curious
about
the
contents
of
the
small
shabby
trunk
which
had
so
evidently
been
hidden
away
in
the
darkest
corner
of
a
dark
closet
in
the
attic
say
those
are
some
tools
billie
said
chet
jubilantly
as
he
pried
away
at
the
lock
you
could
do
just
about
anything
with
them
anything
from
making
a
house
to
breaking
into
one
i
say
he
added
stopping
work
to
look
at
her
entreatingly
do
you
remember
mother
saying
that
aunt
beatrice
left
you
the
house
and
me
the
tools
the
girls
and
boys
laughed
and
billie
patted
his
shoulder
fondly
no
i
do
remember
anything
of
the
sort
she
said
imitating
his
tone
to
perfection
but
if
you
a
good
boy
and
open
the
trunk
in
a
hurry
i
deed
them
to
you
chet
every
last
tool
in
the
honest
to
goodness
cried
chet
his
eyes
beaming
honest
to
goodness
brother
mine
then
chet
fell
to
work
with
fresh
enthusiasm
on
the
lock
it
was
a
stubborn
old
lock
and
required
a
good
deal
of
patience
which
the
girls
had
not
and
tinkering
to
make
it
give
way
but
it
gave
at
last
and
girls
and
boys
leaned
forward
with
sighs
of
pure
excitement
open
it
cried
laura
impatiently
but
billie
put
her
hand
on
the
lid
and
faced
them
with
shining
eyes
we
each
have
just
one
guess
she
said
and
see
who
comes
nearest
to
guessing
right
i
bet
it
money
cried
chet
that
is
fair
i
was
going
to
bet
that
too
so
was
i
and
i
billie
threw
up
her
hands
in
despair
of
course
if
you
all
going
to
guess
the
same
thing
it
all
ruined
she
said
then
added
as
she
bent
forward
and
started
to
lift
the
cover
i
do
know
that
i
blame
you
though
for
i
was
going
to
guess
the
very
same
thing
oh
billie
hurry
you
so
slow
cried
laura
jumping
up
and
down
with
excitement
do
get
at
it
shall
i
do
it
asked
violet
feeling
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
push
billie
away
and
fling
back
the
lid
why
was
she
so
slow
one
two
three
cried
billie
and
then
the
lid
was
off
and
they
were
staring
down
into
the
contents
of
the
trunk
for
a
minute
they
stood
motionless
then
as
though
moved
by
one
impulse
they
dropped
to
their
knees
and
buried
their
hands
in
something
that
jingled
at
their
touch
the
trunk
was
full
to
the
brim
with
old
coins
many
quite
rare
while
scattered
here
and
there
were
postage
stamps
on
sheets
and
loose
queer
foreign
looking
things
that
made
billie
eyes
glisten
as
she
looked
at
them
it
must
have
all
belonged
to
uncle
henry
she
said
in
an
awed
voice
aunt
beatrice
once
said
he
had
a
hobby
for
collecting
postage
stamps
and
old
coins
but
it
money
cried
laura
finding
her
voice
at
last
her
blue
eyes
dark
with
excitement
why
billie
these
old
coins
must
be
worth
a
big
lot
of
money
you
bet
it
a
treasure
said
teddy
soberly
then
with
a
little
smile
he
turned
to
billie
billie
who
was
vivid
and
breathless
with
the
great
discovery
allow
me
to
present
to
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
our
old
friend
captain
kidd
chapter
xxv
large
fortunes
billie
it
worth
a
small
fortune
i
bet
the
stuff
is
worth
several
thousand
dollars
yes
every
bit
of
it
oh
boys
as
much
as
that
questioned
billie
half
hysterically
of
course
came
from
teddy
he
was
on
his
knees
in
front
of
the
treasure
box
see
these
coins
gold
every
one
of
and
as
big
as
ten
dollar
pieces
too
count
cried
chet
then
began
a
hasty
move
on
the
part
of
both
girls
and
boys
to
count
the
gold
and
silver
poor
billie
hands
trembled
so
she
could
scarcely
help
i
make
it
the
gold
and
silver
alone
are
worth
at
least
three
thousand
dollars
declared
teddy
and
do
forget
the
copper
coins
added
ferd
and
remember
too
they
are
old
coins
and
worth
something
extra
from
a
collector
point
of
view
said
chet
from
the
coins
the
young
folks
turned
to
the
postage
stamps
chet
and
teddy
had
done
a
little
stamp
collecting
once
and
knew
that
some
of
the
stamps
were
rare
i
think
they
are
worth
at
least
fifteen
hundred
dollars
more
said
teddy
and
maybe
they
are
worth
twice
that
some
stamps
are
worth
a
hundred
dollars
apiece
it
was
not
until
they
were
called
below
by
gilligan
that
they
gave
up
speculating
about
the
value
of
the
trunk
the
boys
went
off
leaving
the
girls
to
themselves
it
too
good
to
be
true
murmured
billie
over
and
over
again
both
of
the
other
girls
put
their
arms
about
her
you
deserve
it
said
laura
i
awfully
glad
billie
really
i
am
beamed
violet
why
i
be
able
to
go
to
three
towers
hall
cried
billie
a
little
later
when
thinking
it
all
over
and
i
can
send
chet
to
boxton
military
academy
wo
that
be
fine
and
you
can
have
enough
left
to
pay
for
that
old
statue
added
laura
with
a
smile
i
knew
something
good
would
come
out
of
this
queer
old
house
at
cherry
corners
well
you
need
take
all
the
credit
to
yourself
said
billie
the
lilt
of
happiness
and
excitement
in
her
voice
just
remember
young
lady
that
it
was
little
billie
bradley
who
discovered
the
trunk
you
stuck
up
thing
cried
violet
putting
a
fond
arm
again
about
her
billie
dear
she
went
on
in
the
serious
voice
that
was
violet
very
own
i
just
exactly
as
glad
for
myself
that
you
found
the
money
as
i
am
for
you
because
if
laura
and
i
had
had
to
go
to
three
towers
without
you
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
single
thing
yes
we
been
worrying
terribly
about
that
sighed
laura
and
affectionately
billie
patted
a
hand
of
each
there
never
was
a
girl
had
such
wonderful
friends
she
said
and
something
in
her
throat
tightened
a
little
and
it
makes
the
trunk
three
times
as
valuable
she
added
in
a
lighter
tone
because
it
makes
three
people
happy
instead
of
one
which
reminds
me
she
stopped
short
and
put
her
hand
over
her
mouth
in
consternation
now
what
the
matter
violet
surveyed
her
anxiously
is
there
a
pin
sticking
you
or
something
of
course
not
denied
billie
absently
adding
as
she
rose
hastily
to
her
feet
it
just
struck
me
that
i
known
this
wonderful
thing
for
hours
and
i
have
written
home
about
it
yet
well
you
better
read
these
first
sang
out
a
cheery
voice
from
the
door
and
they
turned
to
find
teddy
coming
toward
them
with
some
letters
in
his
hand
letters
was
the
joyful
cry
give
them
to
us
teddy
before
we
take
them
from
you
oh
do
you
really
think
you
could
he
asked
holding
them
behind
his
back
by
way
of
challenge
just
come
on
and
try
i
guarantee
to
hold
off
the
three
of
you
with
one
hand
but
it
was
billie
pleading
face
that
made
him
change
his
mind
please
teddy
she
begged
i
just
been
dying
for
some
letters
from
home
do
keep
me
waiting
all
right
your
word
is
law
said
teddy
gallantly
remembering
that
he
had
read
the
phrase
somewhere
and
it
had
sounded
very
good
here
you
are
and
here
one
for
vi
and
two
for
laura
goodness
what
have
i
done
to
get
only
one
cried
violet
feeling
very
much
abused
well
your
one
looks
fat
enough
to
make
up
for
our
two
billie
assured
her
diplomatically
then
settled
back
to
enjoy
her
own
letters
while
teddy
ran
out
to
join
the
boys
downstairs
one
of
her
letters
was
from
her
mother
and
with
a
loving
smile
she
laid
it
aside
to
be
read
last
she
always
saved
the
best
till
the
last
the
writing
on
the
other
envelope
puzzled
her
now
who
is
writing
to
me
from
mayport
long
island
she
demanded
and
the
girls
looked
up
inquiringly
from
their
letters
another
mystery
asked
laura
for
there
were
not
enough
mysteries
in
the
world
to
satisfy
laura
it
does
look
very
mysterious
answered
billie
turning
the
envelope
around
and
around
in
her
hand
and
finally
holding
it
up
to
the
light
to
see
if
she
could
get
any
clew
to
its
contents
that
way
but
i
surely
never
did
see
that
handwriting
before
i
wonder
well
why
do
you
open
it
violet
inquired
impatiently
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
way
to
find
out
is
she
the
bright
child
sniffed
laura
as
billie
tore
open
the
envelope
and
pulled
out
the
letter
inside
hastily
she
looked
for
the
signature
at
the
end
then
gave
a
little
excited
exclamation
girls
she
said
it
from
miss
beggs
and
she
looked
at
them
with
wide
eyes
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
she
had
no
more
reason
to
fear
a
letter
from
the
teacher
then
she
remembered
and
a
joyful
smile
dawned
on
her
face
girls
i
been
sort
of
dreading
this
letter
all
summer
she
said
her
eyes
sparkling
and
now
when
it
come
i
do
mind
a
bit
is
it
just
wonderful
i
have
money
enough
of
my
own
to
replace
that
horrid
reading
a
book
and
two
or
three
more
like
it
now
she
said
settling
down
with
a
satisfied
little
sigh
if
you
allow
me
read
my
letter
the
girls
watched
her
as
she
read
and
were
amazed
to
see
her
expression
change
from
satisfaction
to
surprise
and
from
surprise
to
something
like
chagrin
well
if
that
is
the
limit
she
cried
laying
down
the
letter
and
regarding
the
girls
disgustedly
here
i
been
worrying
myself
and
chet
sick
all
summer
about
that
horrid
old
statue
and
now
when
i
got
the
money
to
pay
for
it
i
find
out
that
i
probably
would
have
had
to
replace
the
old
thing
anyway
what
do
you
mean
the
others
asked
more
puzzled
than
ever
by
this
flow
of
words
why
billie
went
on
to
explain
glancing
at
the
letter
again
miss
beggs
says
that
the
statue
had
been
broken
before
and
she
had
attempted
to
mend
it
she
says
that
i
not
to
worry
over
it
for
it
would
have
been
only
a
matter
of
time
before
it
had
fallen
to
pieces
itself
anyway
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
think
said
violet
with
a
sigh
that
we
have
wasted
a
good
deal
of
time
and
worry
over
nothing
at
all
well
i
do
see
any
use
of
looking
doleful
about
it
said
laura
briskly
i
should
think
you
be
glad
billie
that
you
wo
have
to
buy
a
statue
it
will
give
you
that
much
more
money
to
have
for
yourself
oh
but
i
buy
a
little
statue
anyway
said
billie
decidedly
awfully
nice
of
miss
beggs
to
tell
me
not
to
bother
about
it
but
the
fact
is
that
i
the
statue
whether
it
was
broken
before
or
not
and
anyway
i
be
glad
to
do
it
now
she
added
with
a
little
gleam
in
her
eye
just
to
show
amanda
peabody
that
i
can
i
say
up
there
are
you
ever
coming
down
called
chet
voice
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
laura
went
out
into
the
hall
to
see
what
he
wanted
we
making
plans
for
the
fall
chet
added
and
in
his
voice
was
a
little
joyous
thrill
that
made
billie
heart
sing
dear
old
chet
if
ever
a
boy
deserved
to
get
what
he
wanted
he
did
and
if
you
do
come
down
and
help
us
we
going
to
leave
you
out
he
added
challengingly
better
come
up
here
suggested
laura
adding
decidedly
we
ca
come
down
you
know
i
like
to
know
why
not
we
ca
leave
the
trunk
laura
explained
patiently
as
if
she
were
addressing
a
particularly
stupid
child
it
too
precious
so
in
the
end
the
girls
had
their
way
and
the
boys
joined
them
in
the
upstairs
room
which
came
the
nearest
to
being
cheerful
of
any
room
in
the
house
except
the
kitchen
at
first
the
boys
talked
and
the
girls
listened
but
gradually
the
bits
of
fancy
work
were
laid
aside
the
girls
joined
in
the
conversation
while
eyes
shone
bright
and
faces
glowed
with
anticipation
of
what
the
autumn
held
in
store
for
them
and
while
laura
and
violet
and
the
two
boys
were
talking
happily
and
all
at
once
teddy
took
the
opportunity
to
whisper
in
billie
ear
i
suppose
being
a
young
lady
with
a
large
fortune
he
said
teasingly
delighting
in
the
color
that
rose
to
her
face
you
wo
find
time
to
recognize
your
old
friends
any
more
and
with
a
dimpling
smile
and
mischief
in
her
eyes
billie
answered
him
of
course
not
she
said
adding
a
trifle
more
seriously
except
only
the
friends
who
stood
by
me
so
loyally
and
offered
to
help
when
i
had
no
fortune
and
are
you
going
to
tell
me
asked
teddy
eagerly
the
names
of
those
favored
friends
i
know
i
did
do
anything
billie
but
am
i
one
of
them
your
name
said
billie
half
laughing
and
half
serious
is
at
the
very
head
of
the
list
do
you
really
mean
teddy
was
beginning
eagerly
when
laura
called
to
them
laughingly
whispering
in
corners
not
allowed
she
cried
come
over
here
and
help
us
decide
what
we
eat
for
our
first
midnight
feast
at
three
towers
hall
we
must
have
midnight
feasts
you
know
of
course
we
must
cried
billie
joyfully
does
it
sound
delicious
oh
we
going
to
have
a
wonderful
time
and
just
how
wonderful
a
time
they
had
and
just
how
merry
and
they
found
the
girls
at
the
boarding
school
will
be
told
in
the
next
volume
of
the
series
entitled
billie
bradley
at
three
towers
hall
or
leading
a
needed
rebellion
in
that
volume
may
be
met
the
girls
and
the
boys
again
in
adventures
as
queer
and
exciting
as
those
already
experienced
well
billie
you
ca
complain
of
your
inheritance
after
all
said
chet
some
time
later
indeed
not
she
answered
was
it
the
best
ever
the
end
