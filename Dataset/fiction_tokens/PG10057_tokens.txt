doctor
mary
paying
guest
just
in
time
was
it
asked
mary
arkroyd
two
days
before
the
the
ceremony
mercifully
it
had
all
been
kept
very
quiet
because
it
was
only
three
months
since
poor
gilly
was
killed
i
forget
whether
you
ever
met
gilly
my
you
know
only
once
in
collingham
gardens
he
had
an
and
dashed
in
one
saturday
morning
when
we
were
just
finishing
our
work
do
you
remember
yes
i
think
i
do
but
since
my
engagement
i
gone
into
colors
oh
of
course
i
gone
back
into
mourning
now
and
everything
was
ready
settlements
and
so
on
you
know
and
rooms
taken
at
bournemouth
and
then
it
all
came
out
how
well
eustace
captain
cranster
i
mean
oh
i
think
he
really
must
have
had
as
he
said
even
though
the
doctor
seemed
to
doubt
it
he
gave
the
colonel
as
a
reference
in
some
shop
and
and
the
bank
would
pay
the
check
other
checks
turned
up
too
and
in
the
end
the
police
went
through
his
papers
and
found
letters
from
well
from
her
you
know
from
bogota
south
america
is
it
he
lived
there
ten
years
you
know
growing
something
beans
or
coffee
or
or
something
i
do
know
what
he
tried
to
say
the
marriage
binding
but
the
colonel
was
it
providential
that
the
colonel
was
home
on
leave
mamma
could
never
have
grappled
with
it
the
colonel
was
sure
it
was
and
so
were
the
lawyers
what
happened
then
the
great
thing
was
to
keep
it
quiet
now
was
it
and
there
was
the
or
so
eustace
captain
cranster
i
mean
said
anyhow
so
on
the
colonel
advice
mamma
squared
the
check
business
and
and
they
gave
him
hours
to
clear
out
papa
i
call
the
colonel
papa
you
know
though
he
really
my
stepfather
used
a
little
influence
i
think
anyhow
it
was
managed
i
never
saw
him
again
mary
poor
dear
was
it
very
bad
yes
but
suppose
we
had
been
married
mary
where
should
i
have
been
mary
arkroyd
left
that
problem
alone
were
you
very
fond
of
him
she
asked
awfully
cynthia
turned
up
to
her
friend
pretty
blue
eyes
suffused
in
tears
it
was
the
end
of
the
world
to
me
that
there
could
be
such
men
i
went
to
bed
mamma
could
do
nothing
with
me
oh
well
she
wrote
to
you
about
all
that
she
told
me
you
were
in
a
pretty
bad
way
i
was
just
desperate
then
one
day
in
bed
the
thought
of
you
came
it
seemed
an
absolute
inspiration
i
remembered
the
card
you
sent
on
my
last
birthday
you
never
forgotten
my
birthdays
though
it
years
since
we
met
with
your
new
address
here
and
your
and
all
the
letters
after
your
name
i
thought
it
rather
funny
a
faint
smile
the
first
since
miss
walford
arrival
at
inkston
probably
the
first
since
captain
eustace
cranster
had
wrought
catastrophe
appeared
on
her
lips
how
i
waited
for
your
answer
you
do
mind
having
me
do
you
dear
mamma
insisted
on
suggesting
the
arrangement
i
was
afraid
you
shy
at
it
not
a
bit
i
should
have
liked
to
have
you
anyhow
but
i
can
make
you
much
more
comfortable
with
the
money
and
your
maid
too
she
looks
as
if
she
was
accustomed
to
the
best
by
the
way
need
she
be
quite
so
tearful
she
more
tearful
than
you
are
yourself
jeanne
very
very
fond
of
me
cynthia
murmured
reproachfully
oh
well
get
her
out
of
that
said
mary
briskly
the
tears
i
mean
not
the
fondness
i
very
fond
of
you
myself
six
years
ago
you
were
a
charming
kitten
and
i
used
to
enjoy
being
your
governess
to
say
nothing
of
finding
the
guineas
very
handy
while
i
was
waiting
to
qualify
you
rather
like
a
kitten
still
one
of
those
ones
siamese
are
they
with
close
fur
and
a
wondering
look
but
you
must
mew
down
here
and
you
must
have
lots
of
milk
and
cream
even
if
rations
go
on
i
can
certify
all
the
extras
for
you
that
the
good
of
being
a
doctor
she
laughed
cheerfully
as
she
took
a
cigarette
from
the
mantelpiece
and
lit
it
cynthia
on
the
other
hand
began
to
sob
prettily
and
not
in
a
noisy
fashion
yet
evidently
heading
towards
a
bout
of
grief
moreover
no
sooner
had
the
first
sound
of
lamentation
escaped
from
her
lips
than
the
door
was
opened
smartly
and
a
buxom
girl
in
lady
maid
uniform
rushed
in
darted
across
the
room
and
knelt
by
cynthia
sobbing
also
and
exclaiming
oh
my
poor
mees
cynthia
mary
smiled
in
a
humorous
contempt
stop
this
she
commanded
rather
brusquely
you
not
been
deceived
too
have
you
jeanne
me
madame
no
my
poor
mees
leave
your
poor
mees
to
me
she
took
a
paper
bag
from
the
mantelpiece
go
and
eat
chocolates
fixed
with
a
firm
and
decidedly
professional
glance
jeanne
stopped
sobbing
and
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
do
listen
outside
the
door
you
must
have
been
listening
wait
till
you
rung
for
miss
cynthia
will
be
all
right
with
me
we
going
for
a
walk
take
her
upstairs
and
put
her
hat
on
her
and
a
thick
coat
cold
and
going
to
rain
i
think
a
walk
mary
cynthia
sobs
stopped
to
make
way
for
this
protest
the
description
of
the
weather
did
not
sound
attractive
yes
yes
now
off
with
both
of
you
here
take
the
chocolates
jeanne
and
try
to
remember
that
it
might
have
been
worse
jeanne
brown
eyes
were
eloquent
of
reproach
captain
cranster
might
have
been
found
out
too
late
after
the
wedding
mary
explained
with
a
smile
try
to
look
at
it
like
that
five
minutes
to
get
ready
cynthia
she
was
ready
for
the
weather
herself
in
the
stout
coat
and
skirt
and
hat
in
which
she
had
driven
the
on
her
round
that
morning
the
disconsolate
pair
drifted
ruefully
from
the
room
though
jeanne
did
recollect
to
take
the
chocolates
doctor
mary
stood
looking
down
at
the
fire
her
lips
still
shaped
in
that
firm
wise
and
philosophical
smile
with
which
doctors
and
nurses
and
indeed
sometimes
anybody
who
happens
to
be
feeling
pretty
well
himself
console
or
exasperate
suffering
humanity
a
very
good
thing
the
poor
silly
child
did
come
to
me
that
was
the
form
her
thoughts
took
for
although
mary
arkroyd
was
and
knew
herself
to
be
no
dazzling
genius
at
her
profession
in
moments
of
candor
she
would
speak
of
having
scraped
through
her
qualifying
examinations
she
had
a
high
opinion
of
her
own
common
sense
and
her
power
of
guiding
weaker
mortals
for
all
that
jeanne
cheek
bulged
with
a
chocolate
there
was
open
resentment
on
her
full
pouting
lips
and
a
hint
of
the
same
feeling
in
cynthia
still
liquid
eyes
when
mistress
and
maid
came
downstairs
again
without
heeding
these
signs
mary
drew
on
her
gauntlets
took
her
and
flung
the
hall
door
open
a
rush
of
cold
wind
filled
the
little
hall
jeanne
shivered
ostentatiously
cynthia
sighed
and
muffled
herself
deeper
in
her
fur
collar
a
good
walking
day
said
mary
decisively
up
to
now
inkston
had
not
impressed
cynthia
walford
very
favorably
it
was
indeed
a
mixed
kind
of
a
place
like
many
villages
which
lie
near
to
london
and
have
been
made
by
modern
developments
more
accessible
than
once
they
were
it
showed
chronological
strata
in
its
buildings
down
by
the
station
all
was
new
red
suburban
mounting
the
tarred
road
the
wayfarer
bore
slightly
to
the
right
along
the
original
village
street
bating
the
aggressive
fronts
of
one
or
two
commercial
innovators
this
was
old
calm
serene
gray
in
tone
and
restful
ornamented
by
three
or
four
good
class
georgian
houses
one
quite
fine
with
well
wrought
iron
gates
this
was
irechester
turning
to
the
right
again
but
more
sharply
the
wayfarer
found
himself
once
more
in
villadom
but
a
villadom
more
ornate
more
costly
with
gardens
to
be
measured
in
acres
or
nearly
this
was
hinton
avenue
hinton
because
it
was
the
maiden
name
of
the
builder
wife
avenue
because
avenue
is
genteel
here
mary
dwelt
but
by
good
luck
her
predecessor
christian
evans
had
seized
upon
a
surviving
old
cottage
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
and
indeed
of
inkston
village
itself
beyond
it
stretched
meadows
while
the
road
turning
again
ran
across
an
open
heath
and
pursued
its
way
to
sprotsfield
four
miles
distant
a
place
of
greater
size
where
all
amenities
could
be
found
it
was
along
this
road
that
the
friends
now
walked
mary
setting
a
brisk
pace
when
once
you
turned
your
back
on
the
avenue
it
heaps
better
she
said
might
be
real
country
looking
this
way
might
it
except
the
naylors
place
oh
and
tower
cottage
there
are
no
houses
between
this
and
sprotsfield
the
wind
blew
shrewdly
with
an
occasional
spatter
of
rain
the
withered
bracken
lay
like
a
vast
carpet
of
dull
under
the
cloudy
sky
scattered
made
fantastic
shapes
in
the
early
gloom
of
a
december
day
a
somber
scene
yet
wanting
only
sunshine
to
make
it
flash
in
a
richness
of
color
even
its
quiet
and
spaciousness
its
melancholy
and
monotony
seemed
to
bid
a
sympathetic
and
soothing
welcome
to
aching
and
fretted
hearts
it
really
is
rather
nice
out
here
cynthia
admitted
i
come
almost
every
afternoon
oh
i
plenty
of
time
my
round
in
the
morning
generally
sees
me
through
except
for
emergencies
births
and
deaths
and
so
on
you
see
my
predecessor
poor
christian
evans
never
had
more
than
the
leavings
and
that
all
i
got
i
believe
the
real
doctor
the
one
irechester
was
angry
at
first
with
evans
for
coming
he
did
want
a
rival
but
christian
was
such
a
meek
mild
simple
little
welshman
not
the
least
pushing
or
ambitious
and
very
soon
irechester
who
quite
well
off
was
glad
to
leave
him
the
dirty
work
i
mean
she
explained
smiling
the
cottages
and
the
panel
work
national
insurance
you
know
and
so
on
well
as
you
know
i
came
down
as
for
christian
he
was
a
of
mine
and
when
the
dear
little
man
was
killed
in
france
irechester
himself
suggested
that
i
should
stay
on
he
was
rather
nice
he
said
all
started
to
laugh
at
you
at
first
but
we
do
laugh
now
anyhow
only
my
wife
does
so
if
you
stay
on
i
do
doubt
we
shall
work
very
well
together
my
dear
colleague
was
that
rather
nice
of
him
cynthia
yes
dear
said
cynthia
in
a
voice
that
sounded
a
good
many
miles
away
mary
laughed
i
bound
to
be
interested
in
you
but
i
suppose
you
not
bound
to
be
interested
in
me
she
observed
resignedly
all
the
same
i
made
a
sensation
at
inkston
just
at
first
and
they
were
even
more
astonished
when
it
turned
out
that
i
could
dance
and
play
lawn
tennis
that
a
funny
little
place
said
cynthia
pointing
to
the
left
side
of
the
road
tower
cottage
that
called
but
what
a
funny
place
cynthia
insisted
a
round
tower
like
a
martello
tower
only
smaller
of
course
and
what
looks
just
like
an
ordinary
cottage
or
small
joined
on
to
it
what
could
the
tower
have
been
for
i
sure
i
do
know
origin
lost
in
the
mists
of
antiquity
an
old
gentleman
named
saffron
lives
there
now
a
patient
of
yours
mary
oh
no
he
well
off
rich
i
believe
so
he
belongs
to
irechester
but
i
often
meet
him
along
the
road
lately
there
always
been
a
younger
man
with
him
a
companion
or
secretary
or
something
of
that
sort
i
hear
he
is
there
are
two
men
coming
along
the
road
now
yes
that
them
the
old
man
and
his
friend
he
rather
striking
to
look
at
which
of
them
the
old
man
of
course
i
have
looked
at
the
secretary
cynthia
i
believe
you
beginning
to
feel
a
little
better
oh
no
i
not
i
afraid
i
not
really
but
there
had
been
a
cheerfully
roguish
little
smile
on
her
face
it
vanished
very
promptly
when
observed
the
two
men
approached
them
on
their
way
no
doubt
to
tower
cottage
the
old
man
was
not
above
middle
height
indeed
scarcely
reached
it
but
he
made
the
most
of
his
inches
carrying
himself
very
upright
with
an
air
of
high
dignity
white
hair
showed
under
an
peaked
cap
he
wore
a
plaid
shawl
swathed
round
him
his
left
arm
being
enveloped
in
its
folds
his
right
rested
in
the
arm
of
his
companion
who
was
taller
than
he
lean
and
clad
in
an
almost
white
and
very
unseasonable
looking
suit
of
some
homespun
material
he
wore
no
covering
on
his
head
a
thick
crop
of
curly
hair
of
a
color
indistinguishable
in
the
dim
light
presumably
affording
such
protection
as
he
needed
his
face
was
turned
down
towards
the
old
man
who
was
looking
up
at
him
and
apparently
talking
to
him
though
in
so
low
a
tone
that
no
sound
reached
mary
and
cynthia
as
they
passed
by
neither
man
gave
any
sign
of
noticing
their
presence
saffron
you
said
rather
a
queer
name
but
he
looks
a
nice
old
man
patriarchal
you
know
what
the
name
of
the
other
one
i
did
hear
somebody
mentioned
him
at
the
naylors
somebody
who
had
heard
something
about
him
in
france
what
was
the
name
it
was
something
queer
too
i
think
they
got
queer
names
and
they
live
in
a
queer
house
cynthia
actually
gave
a
little
laugh
but
are
you
going
to
walk
all
night
mary
dear
oh
poor
thing
i
forgot
you
you
tired
we
turn
back
they
retraced
their
steps
again
passing
tower
cottage
into
which
its
occupants
must
have
gone
for
they
were
no
longer
to
be
seen
that
name
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
said
mary
in
amused
vexation
i
shall
get
it
in
a
moment
cynthia
had
relapsed
into
gloom
it
does
matter
in
the
least
she
murmured
it
beaumaroy
said
mary
in
triumph
i
do
wonder
you
could
remember
that
chapter
ii
the
general
remembers
amongst
other
various
and
no
doubt
useful
functions
miss
delia
wall
performed
that
of
gossip
and
news
to
the
village
of
inkston
a
swarthy
spinster
of
forty
with
a
roving
inquisitive
yet
not
unkindly
eye
she
perambulated
or
rather
percycled
the
district
taking
stock
of
every
incident
not
a
cat
could
kitten
or
a
dog
have
the
mange
without
her
privity
critics
of
her
mental
activity
went
near
to
insinuating
connivance
naturally
therefore
she
was
well
acquainted
with
the
new
development
at
tower
cottage
although
the
isolated
position
of
that
dwelling
made
thorough
observation
piquantly
difficult
she
laid
her
information
before
an
attentive
if
not
very
respectful
audience
gathered
round
the
at
old
place
the
naylors
handsome
house
on
the
outskirts
of
sprotsfield
and
on
the
far
side
of
the
heath
from
inkston
she
was
enjoying
herself
although
she
was
as
usual
a
trifle
distrustful
of
the
quality
of
naylor
smile
it
smacked
of
the
satiric
he
looks
at
you
as
if
you
were
a
specimen
she
had
once
been
heard
to
complain
and
when
she
said
specimen
it
was
obviously
beetles
that
she
had
in
mind
everybody
knows
old
saffron
by
sight
i
mean
and
the
woman
who
does
for
him
she
said
there
never
been
anything
remarkable
about
he
took
his
walk
as
regular
as
clockwork
every
afternoon
and
she
bought
just
the
same
things
every
week
her
books
must
have
tallied
almost
to
a
penny
every
month
naylor
i
know
it
and
it
was
a
very
rare
thing
indeed
for
saffron
to
go
to
london
though
i
have
known
him
to
be
away
once
or
twice
but
very
very
rarely
she
paused
and
added
dramatically
until
the
armistice
full
of
ramifications
that
event
miss
wall
it
affects
even
my
business
naylor
though
now
withdrawn
from
an
active
share
in
its
conduct
was
still
interested
in
the
large
shipping
firm
from
which
he
had
drawn
his
comfortable
fortune
she
looked
at
him
suspiciously
as
he
put
the
ends
of
the
slender
white
fingers
of
his
two
hands
together
and
leant
forward
to
listen
with
that
smile
of
his
and
eyes
faintly
twinkling
but
the
problem
was
seething
in
her
brain
she
had
to
go
on
a
week
after
the
armistice
saffron
went
to
london
by
the
he
traveled
first
anna
did
he
dear
naylor
a
stout
and
placid
dame
was
not
yet
stirred
to
excitement
he
came
down
by
the
and
those
two
men
with
him
and
they
been
there
ever
since
two
men
delia
i
only
seen
one
oh
yes
there
another
sergeant
hooper
they
call
him
a
short
thickset
man
with
a
black
mustache
he
buys
two
bottles
of
rum
every
week
at
the
and
one
minute
please
naylor
i
was
only
going
to
say
that
it
looks
to
me
as
if
this
man
hooper
were
or
had
been
a
soldier
what
do
you
think
never
mind
papa
go
on
miss
wall
i
interested
this
encouragement
came
from
gertie
naylor
a
pretty
girl
of
seventeen
who
was
consuming
much
tea
bread
and
honey
and
since
then
the
old
gentleman
and
this
beaumaroy
go
to
town
regularly
every
week
on
wednesdays
now
who
are
they
how
did
saffron
get
hold
of
them
and
what
are
they
doing
here
i
at
a
loss
anna
apparently
an
and
naylor
did
not
seem
to
assist
matters
by
asking
whether
miss
wall
had
kept
a
constant
eye
on
the
agony
column
naylor
took
up
her
knitting
and
switched
off
to
another
topic
arkroyd
friend
delia
dear
what
a
charming
girl
she
looks
friend
anna
i
did
know
that
a
patient
i
understand
anyhow
taking
valentine
beef
juice
of
course
they
give
that
in
drink
cases
but
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
drugs
more
likely
naylor
suavely
interposed
then
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
began
to
pace
slowly
up
and
down
the
long
room
looking
at
his
beautiful
pictures
his
beautiful
china
his
beautiful
chairs
all
the
beautiful
things
that
were
his
his
family
took
no
notice
of
this
roving
up
and
down
it
was
a
habit
and
was
tacitly
accepted
as
meaning
that
he
had
for
the
moment
had
enough
of
the
company
and
even
of
his
own
sallies
at
its
expense
i
asked
arkroyd
to
bring
her
over
miss
walford
i
mean
the
first
day
it
fine
enough
for
tennis
naylor
pursued
there
was
a
hard
court
at
old
place
so
that
winter
did
not
stop
the
game
entirely
what
a
name
too
walford
it
quite
a
good
name
delia
no
no
anna
beaumaroy
of
course
miss
wall
was
back
at
the
larger
problem
there
alec
voice
he
and
the
general
are
back
from
their
golf
ring
for
another
teapot
gertie
dear
the
door
opened
not
alec
but
the
general
came
in
and
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
it
was
obviously
an
act
of
precaution
and
not
merely
a
normal
exercise
of
good
manners
then
he
walked
up
to
his
hostess
and
said
it
not
my
fault
anna
alec
would
do
it
though
i
shook
my
head
at
him
behind
the
fellow
back
what
do
you
mean
general
cried
the
hostess
naylor
for
his
part
stopped
roving
the
door
again
come
in
beaumaroy
here
tea
beaumaroy
obediently
entered
in
the
wake
of
captain
alec
naylor
who
duly
presented
him
to
naylor
adding
that
beaumaroy
had
been
kind
enough
to
make
the
fourth
in
a
game
with
the
general
the
rector
of
sprotsfield
and
himself
and
he
and
the
parson
were
too
tough
a
nut
for
us
were
they
sir
he
added
to
the
general
besides
being
an
excellent
officer
and
a
capital
fellow
alec
naylor
was
also
reputed
to
be
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
the
service
six
foot
three
very
straight
very
fair
with
features
as
regular
as
any
romantic
hero
of
them
all
and
eyes
as
blue
the
honorable
limp
that
at
present
marked
his
movements
would
it
was
hoped
pass
away
even
his
own
family
were
often
surprised
into
a
new
admiration
of
his
physical
perfections
remarking
one
to
the
other
how
alec
took
the
shine
out
of
every
other
man
in
the
room
there
was
no
shine
no
external
obvious
shine
to
take
out
of
beaumaroy
miss
wall
puzzling
beaumaroy
the
light
showed
him
now
more
clearly
than
when
mary
arkroyd
met
him
on
the
heath
road
but
perhaps
thereby
did
him
no
service
his
features
though
irregular
were
not
ugly
or
insignificant
but
he
wore
a
rather
battered
aspect
there
were
deep
lines
running
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
crowsfeet
had
started
under
the
gray
eyes
which
in
their
turn
looked
more
skeptical
than
ardent
rather
mocking
than
eager
yet
when
he
smiled
his
face
became
not
merely
pleasant
but
confidentially
pleasant
he
seemed
to
smile
especially
to
and
for
the
person
to
whom
he
was
talking
and
his
voice
was
notably
agreeable
soft
and
clear
the
voice
of
a
man
but
not
exactly
of
a
englishman
there
was
no
accent
definite
enough
to
be
called
foreign
certainly
not
to
be
assigned
to
any
particular
race
but
there
was
an
exotic
touch
about
his
manner
of
speech
suggesting
that
even
if
not
that
of
a
foreigner
it
was
shaped
and
colored
by
the
inflexions
of
foreign
tongues
the
hue
of
his
plentiful
and
curly
hair
indistinguishable
to
mary
and
cynthia
now
stood
revealed
as
neither
black
nor
red
nor
auburn
nor
brown
nor
golden
but
just
and
rather
surprisingly
a
plain
yellow
the
color
of
a
cowslip
or
thereabouts
altogether
rather
a
fellow
this
had
been
alec
naylor
first
remark
when
the
rector
of
sprotsfield
pointed
him
out
as
a
possible
fourth
at
the
golf
club
and
the
rough
justice
of
the
description
could
not
be
denied
he
like
alec
bore
his
scars
the
little
finger
of
his
right
hand
was
amputated
down
to
the
knuckle
yet
after
all
this
description
in
particularity
if
not
otherwise
worthy
of
a
classic
novelist
the
thing
yet
remains
that
most
struck
observers
hector
beaumaroy
had
an
adorable
candor
of
manner
he
answered
questions
with
innocent
readiness
and
pellucid
sincerity
it
would
be
impossible
to
think
him
guilty
of
a
lie
ungenerous
to
suspect
so
much
as
a
suppression
of
the
truth
even
naylor
hardened
by
years
experience
of
what
sailors
will
blandly
swear
to
in
collision
cases
was
struck
with
the
open
candor
of
his
bearing
yes
he
said
yes
miss
wall
that
right
we
go
to
town
every
wednesday
no
particular
reason
why
it
should
be
wednesday
but
old
gentlemen
somehow
do
better
do
you
think
so
with
method
and
regular
habits
i
sure
you
know
what
best
for
saffron
said
delia
known
him
a
long
time
have
you
naylor
drew
a
little
nearer
and
listened
the
general
had
put
himself
into
the
corner
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
and
sat
there
with
an
uneasy
and
rather
glowering
aspect
oh
no
no
answered
beaumaroy
a
matter
of
weeks
only
but
the
dear
old
fellow
seemed
to
take
to
me
a
friend
put
us
in
touch
originally
i
seem
to
be
able
to
do
just
what
he
wants
i
hope
your
friend
is
not
really
ill
not
seriously
this
time
the
question
was
naylor
not
miss
delia
his
health
is
really
not
so
bad
but
he
gave
a
glance
round
the
company
as
though
inviting
their
understanding
he
insists
that
not
the
man
he
was
absurd
smiled
naylor
not
much
older
than
i
am
is
he
only
just
turned
seventy
i
believe
but
the
idea
very
persistent
hypochondria
snapped
miss
delia
not
altogether
i
afraid
there
is
a
little
real
heart
trouble
irechester
oh
with
irechester
dear
beaumaroy
you
all
right
again
beaumaroy
glance
that
glance
of
innocent
appeal
ranged
over
the
company
except
the
general
out
of
its
reach
he
seemed
troubled
and
embarrassed
a
most
accomplished
man
evidently
and
a
friend
of
yours
of
course
but
well
there
it
is
a
mere
fancy
of
course
but
unhappily
my
old
friend
does
take
to
him
he
he
thinks
that
he
rather
inquisitorial
a
doctor
duty
i
suppose
irechester
a
sound
man
a
very
sound
man
said
naylor
and
after
all
one
can
ask
almost
any
question
if
one
does
it
tactfully
one
miss
wall
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
only
seen
saffron
twice
he
had
a
little
chill
but
his
manner
unfortunately
rather
er
alarmed
gertie
naylor
with
the
directness
of
youth
propounded
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
if
you
do
like
irechester
oh
it
not
i
who
why
not
have
mary
gertie
made
her
suggestion
eagerly
she
was
very
fond
of
mary
who
from
the
height
of
age
wisdom
and
professional
dignity
had
stooped
to
offer
her
an
equal
friendship
she
means
mary
arkroyd
naylor
explained
yes
i
know
naylor
i
know
about
arkroyd
in
fact
i
know
her
by
sight
but
perhaps
you
do
believe
in
women
doctors
alec
suggested
it
not
that
i
no
prejudices
but
the
responsibility
is
on
me
and
i
know
very
little
of
her
and
well
to
change
one
doctor
it
rather
invidious
oh
as
to
that
irechester
a
sensible
man
he
got
as
much
work
as
he
wants
and
as
much
money
too
he
wo
resent
an
old
man
fancy
well
i
never
thought
of
a
change
but
if
you
all
suggest
it
somehow
it
did
seem
as
if
they
all
and
not
merely
youthful
gertie
had
suggested
it
but
i
should
rather
like
to
know
arkroyd
first
come
and
meet
her
here
that
very
simple
she
often
comes
to
tennis
and
tea
we
let
you
know
the
first
time
she
coming
beaumaroy
most
cordially
accepted
the
idea
and
the
invitation
any
afternoon
i
shall
be
delighted
except
wednesdays
wednesdays
are
sacred
are
they
miss
wall
london
on
wednesdays
for
saffron
and
me
and
the
old
brown
bag
he
laughed
in
a
quiet
merriment
that
old
bag
been
in
a
lot
of
places
with
me
and
has
carried
some
queer
cargoes
now
it
just
goes
to
and
fro
between
here
and
town
with
mudie
books
must
have
books
living
so
much
alone
as
we
do
he
had
risen
as
he
spoke
and
approached
naylor
to
take
leave
she
gave
him
her
hand
very
cordially
i
do
suppose
saffron
cares
to
meet
people
but
any
spare
time
you
have
beaumaroy
we
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
beaumaroy
bowed
as
he
thanked
her
adding
and
i
promised
a
chance
of
meeting
arkroyd
before
long
the
promise
was
renewed
and
the
visitor
took
his
leave
declining
offer
to
run
him
home
in
the
car
the
car
might
startle
my
old
friend
he
pleaded
alec
saw
him
off
and
returned
to
find
the
general
who
had
contrived
to
avoid
more
than
a
distant
bow
of
farewell
to
beaumaroy
standing
on
the
hearthrug
apparently
in
a
state
of
some
agitation
the
envious
years
had
refused
to
punnit
he
was
a
distant
cousin
of
naylor
the
privilege
of
serving
his
country
in
the
great
war
his
career
had
lain
mainly
in
india
and
was
mostly
behind
him
even
at
the
date
of
the
south
african
war
in
which
however
he
had
done
valuable
work
in
one
of
the
supply
services
he
as
short
stout
honest
brave
shrewd
obstinate
and
as
full
of
prejudices
religious
political
and
personal
as
an
egg
is
of
meat
and
all
this
time
he
had
been
slowly
and
painfully
recalling
what
his
young
friend
colonel
merman
the
colonel
was
young
only
relatively
to
the
general
had
told
him
about
hector
beaumaroy
the
name
had
struck
on
his
memory
the
moment
the
rector
pronounced
it
but
it
had
taken
him
a
long
while
to
place
it
accurately
however
now
he
had
it
pat
the
conversation
in
the
club
came
back
he
retailed
it
now
to
the
company
at
old
place
a
pleasant
fellow
beaumaroy
socially
a
very
agreeable
fellow
and
as
for
courage
as
brave
as
you
like
indeed
he
might
have
had
letters
after
his
name
save
for
the
fact
that
he
the
colonel
would
never
recommend
a
man
unless
his
discipline
was
as
good
as
his
leading
and
his
conduct
at
the
base
as
praiseworthy
as
at
the
front
alec
naylor
nodded
his
handsome
head
in
grave
approval
his
father
looked
a
little
discontented
as
though
he
were
swallowing
unpalatable
though
wholesome
food
his
whole
idea
beaumaroy
that
is
was
to
shield
offenders
to
prevent
the
punishment
fitting
the
crime
even
to
console
and
countenance
the
wrongdoer
no
sense
of
discipline
no
moral
sense
the
colonel
had
gone
as
far
as
that
impossible
to
promote
or
to
recommend
for
reward
almost
impossible
to
keep
of
course
if
he
had
been
caught
young
and
put
through
the
mill
it
might
have
been
different
it
the
colonel
heavily
underlined
the
possibility
but
he
came
from
heaven
knew
where
after
a
life
spent
heaven
knew
how
and
he
seemed
to
know
it
himself
the
colonel
had
said
thoughtfully
rolling
his
port
round
in
the
glass
whenever
i
wigged
him
he
offered
to
go
said
he
chuck
his
commission
and
enlist
said
he
be
happier
in
the
ranks
but
i
was
weak
i
bear
to
do
it
after
thus
quoting
his
friend
the
general
added
he
was
weak
damned
weak
and
i
told
him
so
of
course
he
ought
to
have
got
rid
of
him
said
alec
still
sir
there
nothing
er
disgraceful
it
seems
hardly
to
have
come
to
that
the
general
admitted
reluctantly
it
all
rather
makes
me
like
him
gertie
affirmed
courageously
i
think
that
on
the
whole
we
may
venture
to
know
him
in
times
of
peace
naylor
summed
up
that
your
look
out
remarked
the
general
i
warned
you
you
can
do
as
you
like
delia
wall
had
sat
silent
through
the
story
now
she
spoke
up
and
got
back
to
the
real
point
there
nothing
in
all
that
to
show
how
he
comes
to
be
at
mr
saffron
the
general
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
saffron
be
hanged
he
not
the
british
army
he
said
chapter
iii
saffron
at
home
to
put
it
plainly
sergeant
hooper
he
had
been
a
sergeant
for
a
brief
and
precarious
three
weeks
but
he
used
the
title
in
civil
life
whenever
he
safely
could
and
he
could
at
inkston
sergeant
hooper
was
a
dog
beaumaroy
fresh
from
the
comely
presences
of
old
place
unconscious
of
how
the
general
had
ripped
up
his
character
and
record
pleasantly
nursing
a
little
project
concerning
mary
arkroyd
had
never
been
more
forcibly
struck
with
his
protege
than
when
he
arrived
home
on
this
same
evening
and
the
sergeant
met
him
at
the
door
by
gad
sergeant
he
observed
pleasantly
i
do
think
anybody
could
be
such
a
rascal
as
you
look
it
that
faith
that
carries
me
through
the
sergeant
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
it
some
he
remarked
not
to
look
a
rascal
like
they
really
are
sir
the
sir
stuck
out
of
pure
habit
it
carried
no
real
implication
of
respect
meaning
me
laughed
beaumaroy
how
the
old
man
quiet
enough
he
in
the
tower
there
been
there
an
hour
or
more
the
cottage
door
opened
on
to
a
narrow
passage
with
a
staircase
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
a
door
leading
to
a
small
square
parlor
cheerfully
if
cheaply
furnished
and
well
lit
by
an
oil
lamp
a
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
and
beaumaroy
sank
into
a
armchair
beside
it
with
a
sigh
of
comfort
the
sergeant
had
jerked
his
head
towards
another
door
on
the
right
of
the
fireplace
it
led
to
the
tower
beaumaroy
eyes
settled
on
it
an
hour
or
more
has
he
have
you
heard
anything
he
was
making
a
speech
a
little
while
back
that
all
no
more
complaints
and
palpitations
or
anything
of
that
sort
not
as
i
heard
but
he
never
says
much
to
me
wiles
gets
the
benefit
of
his
symptoms
mostly
you
not
sympathetic
perhaps
during
the
talk
hooper
had
been
to
a
cupboard
and
mixed
a
glass
of
whisky
and
soda
he
brought
it
to
beaumaroy
and
put
it
on
a
small
table
by
him
beaumaroy
regarded
his
squat
paunchy
figure
red
face
small
eyes
a
squint
in
one
of
them
and
bulbous
nose
with
a
patient
and
benign
toleration
since
you
ca
expect
sergeant
to
prepossess
the
judge
and
jury
in
your
favor
the
instant
you
make
your
appearance
in
the
box
here
what
are
you
on
to
sir
it
the
more
important
for
you
to
have
it
clearly
in
your
mind
that
we
are
laboring
in
the
cause
of
humanity
freedom
and
justice
exactly
like
the
allies
in
the
late
war
you
know
sergeant
keep
that
in
your
mind
clinch
it
he
has
wanted
you
to
do
anything
particular
or
asked
for
me
no
sir
he
happy
with
with
what
you
call
his
playthings
what
are
they
but
playthings
asked
beaumaroy
tilting
his
glass
to
his
lips
with
a
smile
perhaps
a
little
wry
only
i
wish
as
you
would
talk
about
judges
and
juries
the
sergeant
complained
i
really
do
know
whether
it
a
civil
or
a
criminal
matter
or
both
or
neither
beaumaroy
admitted
candidly
but
what
we
do
know
sergeant
is
that
it
provides
us
with
excellent
billets
and
rations
moreover
a
thing
that
you
certainly
will
not
appreciate
it
gratifies
my
taste
for
the
mysterious
i
hope
there
a
bit
more
coming
from
it
than
that
said
the
sergeant
that
is
if
we
stick
together
faithful
sir
oh
we
shall
one
thing
puzzles
me
about
you
sergeant
i
do
think
i
mentioned
it
before
sometimes
you
speak
almost
like
an
educated
man
at
others
your
speech
is
well
illiterate
well
sir
it
a
sort
of
mixture
of
my
mother
she
was
class
the
blighter
who
come
after
my
father
and
the
board
school
of
course
what
they
call
the
educational
ladder
that
explains
it
by
the
way
i
thinking
of
changing
our
doctor
good
job
too
i
that
irechester
stares
at
you
that
chap
does
does
he
stare
at
your
eyes
asked
beaumaroy
thoughtfully
i
do
know
that
he
does
at
my
eyes
particularly
nothing
wrong
with
is
there
the
sergeant
sounded
rather
truculent
never
mind
that
but
i
fancied
he
stared
at
saffron
and
i
read
somewhere
in
some
book
or
other
that
doctors
can
tell
or
guess
by
the
eyes
well
that
only
an
idea
how
does
a
lady
doctor
appeal
to
you
sergeant
i
should
be
shy
said
the
sergeant
grinning
vulgar
vulgar
beaumaroy
murmured
that
mary
arkroyd
i
had
thought
of
her
she
ought
to
be
fair
easy
to
kid
you
notions
sometimes
sir
beaumaroy
stretched
out
his
legs
debonnair
legs
to
the
seducing
blaze
of
oak
logs
i
have
really
a
care
in
the
world
he
said
the
sergeant
reply
or
comment
had
a
disconcerting
ring
and
sure
of
that
what
the
bloke
always
says
to
the
i
no
intention
of
being
a
murderer
sergeant
beaumaroy
eyebrows
were
raised
in
gentle
protest
once
you
in
with
a
job
you
never
know
his
retainer
observed
darkly
beaumaroy
laughed
oh
go
to
the
devil
and
mix
me
another
whisky
yet
a
vague
uneasiness
showed
itself
on
his
face
he
looked
across
the
room
at
the
man
handling
the
bottles
in
the
cupboard
he
made
one
queer
restless
movement
of
his
arms
as
though
to
free
himself
then
in
a
moment
he
sprang
from
his
chair
a
glad
kindly
smile
illuminating
his
face
he
bowed
in
a
very
courtly
fashion
exclaiming
ah
here
you
are
sir
and
all
well
i
hope
saffron
had
entered
from
the
door
leading
to
the
tower
carefully
closing
it
after
him
hooper
hand
went
up
to
his
forehead
in
the
ghost
of
a
military
salute
but
a
sneering
smile
persisted
on
his
lips
the
only
notice
saffron
took
of
him
was
a
jerk
of
the
head
towards
the
passage
an
abrupt
and
ungracious
dismissal
which
however
the
sergeant
silently
accepted
and
stumped
out
the
greeting
reserved
for
beaumaroy
was
vastly
different
beaumaroy
own
cordiality
was
more
than
reciprocated
it
seemed
impossible
to
doubt
that
a
genuine
affection
existed
between
the
elder
and
the
younger
man
though
the
latter
had
not
thought
fit
to
mention
the
fact
to
sergeant
hooper
a
tiring
day
my
dear
hector
very
tiring
i
transacted
a
lot
of
business
but
never
mind
that
it
will
keep
what
of
your
doings
having
sat
the
old
man
in
the
big
chair
by
the
fire
beaumaroy
sauntered
across
to
the
door
of
the
tower
locked
it
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
then
he
returned
to
the
fire
and
standing
in
front
of
it
gave
a
lively
and
detailed
account
of
his
visit
to
old
place
they
appear
to
be
pleasant
people
very
pleasant
i
should
like
to
know
them
if
it
was
not
desirable
for
me
to
live
an
entirely
secluded
life
saffron
speech
was
very
distinct
and
clean
cut
rather
rapid
high
in
tone
but
not
disagreeable
you
make
pure
fun
of
this
miss
wall
as
you
do
of
so
many
things
hector
but
he
smiled
up
at
beaumaroy
inquisitiveness
is
not
our
favorite
sin
just
now
she
so
indiscriminately
inquisitive
that
it
a
thousand
to
one
against
her
really
finding
out
anything
of
importance
sir
beaumaroy
sometimes
addressed
his
employer
as
saffron
but
much
more
commonly
he
used
the
respectful
sir
i
think
i
equal
to
putting
miss
delia
wall
off
still
she
noticed
our
weekly
journeys
half
inkston
goes
to
town
every
day
sir
and
the
rest
three
times
twice
or
once
a
week
i
called
her
particular
attention
to
the
bag
and
told
her
it
was
for
books
from
mudie
positive
statements
like
that
are
a
mistake
saffron
spoke
with
a
sudden
sharpness
in
pointed
rebuke
if
i
form
a
right
idea
of
that
woman
she
quite
capable
of
going
to
mudie
to
ask
about
us
by
jove
you
right
sir
and
i
was
wrong
we
better
go
and
take
out
a
subscription
tomorrow
she
hardly
go
so
far
as
to
ask
the
date
we
started
it
yes
let
that
be
done
and
remember
no
unnecessary
talk
his
tone
grew
milder
as
though
he
were
mollified
by
beaumaroy
ready
submission
to
his
reproof
we
have
some
places
to
call
at
have
we
they
said
they
have
some
useful
addresses
ready
for
us
sir
afraid
though
that
we
exhausting
the
most
obvious
resources
still
i
hope
for
a
few
more
good
consignments
i
suppose
you
remain
confident
that
the
sergeant
has
no
suspicions
as
regards
that
particular
aspect
of
the
matter
i
sure
of
it
up
to
the
present
of
course
there
might
be
an
accident
but
with
him
and
wiles
both
off
the
premises
at
night
it
hardly
likely
and
i
never
let
the
bag
out
of
my
sight
while
it
in
the
room
with
them
hardly
out
of
my
hand
i
should
like
to
trust
him
but
it
hardly
fair
to
put
such
a
strain
on
his
loyalty
much
safer
not
sir
as
long
as
we
not
driven
to
it
after
all
though
i
believe
the
fellow
is
out
to
redeem
his
character
his
is
an
unblemished
record
but
the
work
the
physical
labor
entailed
on
you
hector
make
yourself
easy
about
that
sir
i
as
strong
as
a
horse
the
good
for
me
remember
i
had
four
years
service
saffron
smiled
pensively
it
would
have
been
funny
if
we
met
over
there
you
and
i
it
would
sir
laughed
beaumaroy
but
that
could
hardly
have
happened
without
some
very
curious
accident
the
old
man
harked
back
yes
a
few
more
good
consignments
and
we
can
think
in
earnest
of
your
start
he
was
warming
his
hands
thin
yellowish
hands
at
the
fire
now
and
his
gaze
was
directed
into
it
looking
down
on
him
beaumaroy
allowed
a
smile
to
appear
on
his
lips
a
queer
smile
which
seemed
to
be
compounded
of
affection
pity
and
amusement
the
difficulties
there
remain
considerable
for
the
present
he
remarked
they
must
be
overcome
once
again
the
old
man
voice
became
sharp
and
even
dictatorial
they
shall
be
sir
depend
on
it
beaumaroy
air
was
suddenly
confident
almost
braggart
saffron
nodded
approvingly
but
anyhow
i
ca
very
well
start
till
favorable
news
comes
from
hush
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
wiles
to
lay
the
table
i
suppose
yes
come
in
he
added
hastily
to
beaumaroy
in
an
undertone
yes
we
must
wait
for
that
wiles
entered
as
he
spoke
she
was
a
colorless
negative
kind
of
a
woman
fair
fat
flabby
and
forty
or
thereabouts
she
had
been
the
slave
of
a
local
carpenter
now
deceased
by
reason
of
her
nature
was
to
be
the
slave
of
the
nearest
male
creature
not
from
affection
her
affections
were
anemic
but
rather
as
it
seemed
from
an
instinctive
desire
to
shuffle
off
from
herself
any
responsibility
but
at
all
events
she
was
entirely
free
from
miss
delia
wall
proclivity
saffron
rose
i
go
and
wash
my
hands
we
dine
just
as
we
are
hector
beaumaroy
opened
the
door
for
him
he
acknowledged
the
attention
with
a
little
nod
and
passed
out
to
the
staircase
in
the
narrow
passage
beaumaroy
appeared
to
consider
himself
absolved
from
any
preparation
for
he
returned
to
the
big
chair
and
sinking
into
it
lit
another
cigarette
meanwhile
wiles
laid
the
table
and
presently
sergeant
hooper
appeared
with
a
bottle
of
wine
that
at
least
is
the
real
stuff
thought
beaumaroy
as
he
eyed
it
in
pleasurable
anticipation
where
the
dear
old
man
got
it
i
do
know
but
in
itself
it
almost
worth
all
the
racket
and
really
in
its
present
stages
so
far
as
its
present
developments
went
the
racket
pleased
him
it
amused
his
active
brain
besides
as
he
had
said
to
saffron
exercising
his
active
body
though
certainly
in
a
rather
grotesque
and
bizarre
fashion
the
attraction
of
it
went
deeper
than
that
it
appealed
to
some
of
those
tendencies
and
impulses
of
his
character
which
had
earned
such
heavy
censure
from
punnit
and
had
produced
so
grave
an
expression
on
captain
alec
handsome
face
without
however
being
even
in
that
officer
exacting
judgment
disgraceful
and
finally
there
was
the
lure
of
unexplored
possibilities
not
only
material
and
external
but
psychological
not
only
touching
what
others
might
do
or
what
might
happen
to
them
but
raising
also
speculation
as
to
what
he
might
do
or
what
might
happen
to
him
at
his
own
hands
for
example
how
far
he
would
flout
authority
defy
the
usual
and
deny
the
accepted
the
love
of
rebellion
of
making
foolish
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
of
hampering
the
orderly
and
inexorable
treatment
of
people
just
as
according
to
the
best
modern
lights
they
ought
to
be
treated
this
lawless
love
was
strong
in
beaumaroy
not
as
a
principle
it
was
the
stronger
for
being
an
instinct
a
wayward
instinct
that
might
carry
him
he
scarce
knew
where
saffron
came
back
greeted
again
by
beaumaroy
courtly
bow
and
hooper
vaguely
reminiscent
but
slovenly
military
salute
the
pair
sat
down
to
a
homely
beefsteak
but
the
golden
tinted
wine
gurgled
into
their
glasses
but
before
they
fell
to
there
was
a
little
incident
a
sudden
but
fierce
anger
seized
old
saffron
in
his
harshest
tones
he
rapped
out
at
the
sergeant
my
knife
you
careless
scoundrel
you
have
given
me
my
knife
beaumaroy
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
muttered
exclamation
it
all
my
fault
sir
i
forgot
to
give
it
to
hooper
i
always
lock
it
up
when
i
go
out
he
went
to
a
little
oak
sideboard
and
unlocked
a
drawer
then
came
back
to
saffron
side
here
it
is
and
i
humbly
apologize
very
good
very
good
said
the
old
man
testily
as
he
took
the
implement
ai
anybody
going
to
apologize
to
me
asked
hooper
scowling
oh
get
out
sergeant
said
beaumaroy
we
ca
bother
about
your
finer
feelings
he
glanced
anxiously
at
saffron
all
right
now
are
you
sir
he
inquired
saffron
drank
his
glass
of
wine
i
am
perhaps
too
sensitive
to
any
kind
of
inattention
but
it
not
wholly
unnatural
in
my
position
hector
we
both
desire
to
be
attentive
and
respectful
sir
do
we
hooper
oh
my
yes
grinned
the
sergeant
showing
his
very
ugly
teeth
only
owing
that
we
quite
been
brought
up
in
royal
palaces
chapter
iv
professional
etiquette
irechester
was
a
man
of
considerable
attainments
and
an
active
though
not
very
persevering
intellect
he
was
widely
read
both
in
professional
and
general
literature
but
had
shrunk
from
the
arduous
path
of
specialization
and
he
shrank
even
more
from
the
drudgery
of
his
calling
he
had
private
means
inherited
in
middle
life
his
wife
had
a
respectable
portion
there
was
then
nothing
in
his
circumstances
to
thwart
his
tastes
and
tendencies
he
had
soon
come
to
see
in
the
late
evans
a
means
of
relief
rather
than
a
threat
of
rivalry
even
more
easily
he
slipped
into
the
same
way
of
regarding
mary
arkroyd
helped
thereto
by
a
lingering
feeling
that
after
all
and
in
spite
of
all
when
it
came
to
really
serious
cases
a
woman
could
not
at
best
play
more
than
second
fiddle
so
as
has
been
seen
he
patronized
and
encouraged
mary
he
told
himself
that
when
she
had
thoroughly
proved
her
capacity
within
the
limits
which
he
ascribed
to
it
to
take
her
into
partnership
would
not
be
a
bad
arrangement
true
he
could
pretty
well
choose
his
patients
now
but
as
senior
partner
he
would
be
able
to
do
it
completely
it
was
inconceivable
that
for
example
the
naylors
great
friends
should
ever
leave
him
but
he
would
like
to
be
quite
secure
of
the
pick
of
new
patients
some
of
whom
might
through
ignorance
or
whim
call
in
mary
there
was
old
saffron
for
instance
he
was
in
irechester
private
opinion
or
perhaps
it
should
be
said
in
his
private
suspicions
an
interesting
case
yet
just
for
that
reason
unreliable
and
evidently
ready
to
take
offense
it
was
because
of
cases
of
that
kind
that
he
contemplated
offering
partnership
to
mary
he
would
both
be
sure
of
keeping
them
and
able
to
devote
himself
to
them
but
his
wife
laughed
at
mary
or
at
that
development
of
the
feminist
movement
which
had
produced
her
and
so
many
other
more
startling
phenomena
the
doctor
was
fond
of
his
wife
a
sprightly
fashionable
still
very
pretty
woman
but
her
laughter
and
the
opinion
it
represented
were
to
him
the
merest
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot
the
fine
afternoon
had
come
a
few
days
before
christmas
and
he
sat
side
by
side
with
naylor
both
warmly
wrapped
in
coats
and
rugs
watching
the
lawn
tennis
at
old
place
doctor
mary
and
beaumaroy
were
playing
together
the
latter
accustoming
himself
to
a
finger
short
in
gripping
his
racquet
against
cynthia
and
captain
alec
the
captain
could
not
yet
cover
the
court
in
his
old
fashion
but
his
height
and
reach
made
him
formidable
at
the
net
and
cynthia
was
very
active
ten
days
of
inkston
air
had
made
a
vast
difference
to
cynthia
and
something
else
was
helping
it
required
no
common
loyalty
to
lost
causes
and
ruined
ideals
it
is
surely
not
harsh
to
indicate
captain
cranster
by
these
terms
to
resist
alec
naylor
in
fact
he
had
almost
taken
breath
away
at
their
first
meeting
she
thought
that
she
had
never
seen
anything
quite
so
magnificent
or
all
round
and
from
all
points
of
view
so
romantic
his
stature
handsomeness
limp
renown
who
can
be
surprised
at
it
moreover
he
was
modest
and
simple
and
no
fool
within
the
bounds
of
his
experience
she
seems
a
nice
little
girl
that
and
uncommon
pretty
naylor
remarked
yes
but
he
a
queer
fish
i
fancy
the
doctor
answered
also
rather
absently
their
minds
were
not
running
on
parallel
lines
my
boy
a
queer
fish
naylor
expostulated
humorously
irechester
smiled
his
lips
shut
close
and
tight
his
smile
was
quick
but
narrow
you
matchmaking
i
was
diagnosing
he
said
naylor
apologized
i
a
desperate
instinct
to
fit
all
these
young
fellows
up
with
mates
as
soon
as
possible
is
it
only
fair
and
also
extremely
expedient
but
it
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
leave
to
them
ca
you
as
to
beaumaroy
i
suppose
you
meant
him
not
alec
i
think
you
must
have
been
talking
to
old
tom
punnit
or
rather
hearing
him
talk
punnit
general
view
is
sound
enough
i
think
as
to
the
characteristics
but
he
does
appreciate
his
cunning
cunning
naylor
was
openly
astonished
he
does
strike
me
as
a
cunning
man
not
in
the
least
possibly
possibly
i
say
not
in
his
ends
but
in
his
means
and
expedients
that
my
view
i
just
put
it
on
record
naylor
i
never
like
talking
too
much
about
my
cases
beaumaroy
not
your
patient
is
he
his
employer
i
suppose
he
his
employer
saffron
is
well
i
thought
it
advisable
to
see
saffron
alone
i
tried
to
saffron
was
reluctant
this
man
here
openly
against
it
next
time
i
shall
insist
because
i
think
mind
you
at
present
i
no
more
than
think
that
there
more
in
saffron
case
than
meets
the
eye
naylor
glanced
at
him
smiling
you
fellows
are
always
starting
hares
he
said
game
and
set
cried
captain
alec
and
to
his
partner
thank
you
very
much
for
carrying
a
cripple
but
irechester
attention
remained
fixed
on
beaumaroy
and
consequently
on
doctor
mary
for
the
partners
did
not
separate
at
the
end
of
their
game
but
after
putting
on
their
coats
began
to
walk
up
and
down
together
on
the
other
side
of
the
court
in
animated
conversation
though
beaumaroy
did
most
of
the
talking
mary
listening
in
her
usual
grave
and
composed
manner
now
and
then
a
word
or
two
reached
irechester
ears
old
naylor
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
a
reverie
over
his
cigar
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
took
no
pains
not
to
overhear
once
at
least
he
plainly
heard
saffron
from
beaumaroy
he
thought
that
the
same
lips
spoke
his
own
name
and
he
was
sure
that
doctor
mary
did
beaumaroy
was
speaking
rather
urgently
and
making
gestures
with
his
hands
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
appealing
to
his
companion
in
some
difficulty
or
perplexity
irechester
mouth
was
severely
compressed
and
his
glance
suspicious
as
he
watched
the
scene
was
ended
by
gertie
naylor
calling
these
laggards
in
to
tea
to
which
meal
the
rest
of
the
company
had
already
betaken
itself
at
the
tea
table
they
found
general
punnit
discoursing
on
war
and
giving
idealists
what
idealists
usually
get
the
general
believed
in
war
he
pressed
the
biological
argument
did
not
flinch
when
naylor
dubbed
him
the
british
bernhardi
and
invoked
the
support
of
these
medical
gentleman
this
with
a
smile
at
doctor
mary
expense
for
his
point
of
view
war
tested
proved
braced
hardened
it
was
nature
crucible
it
was
the
antidote
to
softness
and
sentimentality
it
was
the
vindication
of
the
strong
the
elimination
of
the
weak
i
suppose
there
a
lot
in
all
that
sir
said
alec
naylor
but
i
do
think
the
effect
on
one
character
is
always
what
you
say
i
think
i
come
out
of
this
awful
business
a
good
deal
softer
than
i
went
in
he
laughed
in
an
apologetic
way
more
more
sentimental
if
you
like
with
more
feeling
do
you
know
for
human
life
and
suffering
and
so
on
i
seen
a
great
many
men
killed
but
the
sight
has
made
me
any
more
ready
to
kill
men
in
fact
quite
the
reverse
he
smiled
again
really
sometimes
for
a
row
of
pins
i
have
turned
conscientious
objector
naylor
looked
apprehensively
at
the
general
would
he
explode
no
he
took
it
quite
quietly
you
a
man
who
can
afford
to
say
it
alec
he
remarked
with
a
nod
that
was
almost
approving
naylor
looked
affectionately
at
his
son
and
turned
to
beaumaroy
and
what
the
war
done
to
you
he
asked
and
this
question
did
draw
from
the
general
if
not
an
explosion
at
least
a
rather
contemptuous
smile
beaumaroy
had
earned
no
right
to
express
opinions
but
express
one
he
did
and
with
his
habitual
air
of
candor
i
believe
it
destroyed
every
scruple
i
ever
had
mr
beaumaroy
exclaimed
his
hostess
scandalized
while
the
two
girls
cynthia
and
gertie
laughed
i
mean
it
can
you
see
human
life
treated
as
dirt
absolutely
as
cheap
as
dirt
for
three
years
and
come
out
thinking
it
worth
anything
can
you
fight
for
your
own
hand
right
or
wrong
oh
yes
right
or
wrong
in
the
end
and
it
no
good
blinking
it
can
you
do
that
for
three
years
in
war
and
then
hesitate
to
fight
for
your
own
hand
right
or
wrong
in
peace
who
really
cares
for
right
or
wrong
anyhow
a
pause
ensued
rather
an
uncomfortable
pause
there
was
a
raw
sincerity
in
beaumaroy
utterance
that
made
it
a
challenge
i
honestly
think
we
did
care
about
the
rights
and
wrongs
we
in
england
said
naylor
that
was
certainly
so
at
the
beginning
irechester
agreed
beaumaroy
took
him
up
smartly
aye
at
the
beginning
but
what
about
when
our
blood
got
up
what
then
would
we
in
our
hearts
rather
have
been
right
and
got
a
licking
or
wrong
and
given
one
a
searching
question
mused
old
naylor
what
say
you
tom
punnit
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
put
the
question
the
general
answered
brusquely
may
i
ask
why
not
sir
said
beaumaroy
respectfully
because
i
believed
in
god
i
knew
that
we
were
right
and
i
knew
that
we
should
win
are
we
in
theology
now
or
still
in
biology
asked
irechester
rather
acidly
you
getting
out
of
my
anyhow
smiled
naylor
and
sure
the
girls
must
be
bewildered
mamma
i
done
biology
and
many
people
think
they
done
theology
chuckled
naylor
done
it
completely
i
raised
a
pretty
argument
said
beaumaroy
smiling
i
sorry
i
only
meant
to
answer
your
question
about
the
effect
the
whole
thing
has
had
on
myself
even
your
answer
to
that
was
pretty
startling
beaumaroy
said
doctor
mary
smiling
too
you
gave
us
to
understand
that
it
had
obliterated
for
you
all
distinctions
of
right
and
wrong
did
you
did
i
go
as
far
as
that
he
laughed
then
i
open
to
the
remark
that
they
ca
have
been
very
strong
at
first
now
do
destroy
the
general
interest
of
your
thesis
naylor
implored
it
quite
likely
that
yours
is
a
case
as
common
as
alec
or
even
commoner
brutal
and
licentious
soldiery
is
that
a
classic
phrase
in
our
histories
all
the
same
i
fancy
beaumaroy
does
himself
less
than
justice
he
laughed
we
shall
be
able
to
judge
of
that
when
we
know
him
better
at
all
events
miss
gertie
look
out
that
i
do
fake
the
score
at
tennis
said
beaumaroy
a
man
might
be
capable
of
murder
but
not
capable
of
that
said
alec
a
truly
british
sentiment
cried
his
father
tom
we
have
got
back
to
the
national
ideals
the
discussion
ended
in
laughter
and
the
talk
turned
to
lighter
matters
but
as
mary
arkroyd
drove
cynthia
home
across
the
heath
her
thoughts
returned
to
it
the
two
men
the
two
soldiers
seemed
to
have
given
an
authentic
account
of
what
their
experience
had
done
to
them
both
as
she
saw
the
case
had
been
moved
to
pity
horror
and
indignation
that
such
things
should
be
done
or
should
have
to
be
done
in
the
world
after
that
point
came
the
divergence
the
higher
nature
had
been
raised
the
lower
debased
alec
naylor
sympathies
had
been
sharpened
and
sensitized
beaumaroy
blunted
where
the
one
had
found
ideals
and
incentives
the
other
found
despair
a
despair
that
issued
in
excuses
and
denied
high
standards
and
the
finer
mind
belonged
to
the
finer
soldier
that
she
knew
for
gertie
had
told
her
general
punnit
story
and
however
much
she
might
discount
it
as
the
tale
of
an
elderly
martinet
yet
it
stood
for
something
for
something
that
could
never
be
attributed
to
alec
naylor
and
yet
for
her
mind
traveled
back
to
her
earlier
talk
by
the
tennis
court
beaumaroy
had
a
conscience
had
feelings
he
was
fond
of
old
saffron
he
felt
a
responsibility
for
him
felt
it
indeed
keenly
or
was
he
under
all
that
seeming
openness
a
consummate
hypocrite
did
he
value
saffron
only
as
a
milk
cow
the
doting
giver
of
a
large
salary
was
his
only
desire
to
humor
him
keep
him
in
good
health
and
temper
and
use
him
to
his
own
profit
a
puzzling
man
but
at
all
events
cutting
a
poor
figure
beside
alec
naylor
about
whom
there
could
circle
no
clouds
of
doubt
doctor
mary
learning
and
gravity
did
not
prevent
her
from
drawing
a
very
heroic
and
rather
romantic
figure
of
captain
alec
notwithstanding
that
she
sometimes
found
him
rather
hard
to
talk
to
she
felt
cynthia
arm
steal
around
her
waist
and
cynthia
said
softly
i
did
enjoy
my
afternoon
can
we
go
again
soon
mary
mary
glanced
at
her
cynthia
laughed
and
blushed
is
he
splendid
cynthia
murmured
but
i
do
like
beaumaroy
do
you
i
say
yes
to
the
first
question
but
i
not
quite
ready
to
answer
the
second
said
mary
with
a
laugh
three
days
later
on
christmas
eve
one
whom
jeanne
who
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
hall
described
as
being
all
there
was
possible
of
ugliness
delivered
with
a
request
for
an
immediate
answer
the
following
note
for
mary
arkroyd
dear
arkroyd
saffron
is
unwell
and
i
have
insisted
that
he
must
see
a
doctor
so
much
he
has
yielded
after
a
fight
but
nothing
will
induce
him
to
see
irechester
again
on
this
point
i
tried
to
reason
with
him
but
in
vain
he
is
obstinate
and
resolved
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
putting
you
in
a
difficult
and
disagreeable
position
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
ask
you
to
call
on
him
professionally
i
hope
that
irechester
will
not
be
hurt
by
a
whim
which
is
no
doubt
itself
merely
a
symptom
of
disordered
nerves
for
irechester
has
been
most
attentive
and
very
successful
hitherto
in
dealing
with
the
dear
old
gentleman
but
my
first
duty
is
to
saffron
if
it
will
ease
matters
at
all
pray
hold
yourself
at
liberty
to
show
this
note
to
irechester
may
i
beg
you
to
be
kind
enough
to
call
at
your
earliest
convenience
though
it
is
alas
a
rough
evening
to
ask
you
to
come
out
yours
very
faithfully
hector
beaumaroy
how
very
awkward
exclaimed
mary
she
had
prided
herself
on
a
rigorous
abstention
from
poaching
she
fancied
that
men
were
very
ready
to
accuse
women
of
not
playing
the
game
and
had
been
resolved
to
give
no
color
to
such
an
accusation
saffron
has
sent
for
me
professionally
he
ill
it
seems
she
said
to
cynthia
why
should
he
because
he
is
a
patient
of
irechester
not
a
patient
of
mine
but
people
often
change
their
doctors
do
they
he
thinks
cleverer
i
suppose
and
i
expect
you
are
really
there
was
no
use
in
expounding
professional
etiquette
to
cynthia
mary
had
to
decide
the
point
for
herself
and
quickly
the
old
man
might
be
seriously
beaumaroy
had
said
at
the
naylors
that
his
attacks
were
sometimes
alarming
suddenly
she
recollected
that
he
had
also
seemed
to
hint
that
they
were
more
alarming
than
irechester
appeared
to
appreciate
she
had
not
taken
much
notice
of
that
hint
at
the
time
but
now
it
recurred
to
her
very
distinctly
there
was
no
suggestion
of
the
sort
in
beaumaroy
letter
beaumaroy
had
written
a
letter
that
could
be
shown
to
irechester
was
that
dishonesty
or
only
a
pardonable
diplomacy
i
suppose
i
must
go
and
explain
to
irechester
afterwards
she
rang
the
bell
to
recall
the
maid
and
gave
her
answer
say
i
will
be
round
as
soon
as
possible
is
the
messenger
walking
he
got
a
bicycle
miss
all
right
i
shall
be
there
almost
as
soon
as
he
is
she
seemed
to
have
no
alternative
just
as
beaumaroy
had
none
yet
while
she
put
on
her
mackintosh
it
was
very
wet
and
misty
got
out
her
car
and
lit
her
lamps
her
face
was
still
fretful
and
her
mind
disturbed
for
now
as
she
looked
back
on
it
beaumaroy
conversation
with
her
at
old
place
seemed
just
a
prelude
to
this
summons
and
meant
to
prepare
her
for
it
perhaps
that
too
was
pardonable
diplomacy
and
no
reference
to
it
could
be
expected
in
a
letter
which
she
was
at
liberty
to
show
to
irechester
she
wondered
uncomfortably
how
irechester
would
take
it
chapter
v
a
familiar
implement
as
mary
brought
her
car
to
a
stand
at
the
gate
of
the
little
front
garden
of
tower
cottage
she
saw
through
the
mist
beaumaroy
corrugated
face
he
was
standing
in
the
doorway
and
the
light
in
the
passage
revealed
it
it
seemed
to
her
to
wear
a
triumphant
impish
look
but
this
vanished
as
he
advanced
to
meet
her
relieved
her
of
the
neat
black
handbag
which
she
always
carried
with
her
on
her
visits
and
suggested
gravely
that
she
should
at
once
go
upstairs
and
see
her
patient
he
quieter
now
he
said
the
mere
news
that
you
were
coming
had
a
soothing
effect
let
me
show
you
the
way
he
led
her
upstairs
and
into
a
small
room
on
the
first
floor
nakedly
furnished
with
necessities
but
with
a
cheery
fire
blazing
in
the
grate
old
saffron
lay
in
bed
propped
up
by
pillows
his
silver
hair
strayed
from
under
a
nightcap
he
wore
a
light
blue
bedroom
jacket
its
color
matched
that
of
his
restless
eyes
his
arms
were
under
the
clothes
from
the
elbows
down
he
was
rather
flushed
but
did
not
look
seriously
ill
and
greeted
doctor
mary
with
dignified
composure
i
see
arkroyd
alone
hector
beaumaroy
gave
the
slightest
little
jerk
of
his
head
and
the
old
man
added
quickly
i
am
sure
of
myself
quite
sure
the
phrase
sounded
rather
an
odd
one
to
mary
but
beaumaroy
accepted
the
assurance
with
a
nod
all
right
i
wait
downstairs
sir
i
hope
you
bring
me
a
good
account
of
him
doctor
so
he
left
mary
to
make
her
examination
going
downstairs
he
shook
his
head
once
pursed
up
his
lips
and
then
smiled
doubtfully
as
a
man
may
do
when
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
take
a
chance
when
mary
rejoined
him
she
asked
for
pen
and
paper
wrote
a
prescription
and
requested
that
beaumaroy
man
should
take
it
to
the
chemist
he
went
out
to
give
it
to
the
sergeant
and
when
he
came
back
found
her
seated
in
the
big
chair
by
the
fire
the
present
little
attack
is
nothing
beaumaroy
she
said
stomachic
with
a
little
fever
if
he
takes
what
i
prescribed
he
ought
to
be
all
right
in
the
morning
but
i
suppose
you
know
that
there
is
valvular
disease
quite
definite
did
irechester
tell
you
yes
but
he
said
there
was
no
particular
no
immediate
danger
if
he
kept
quiet
and
free
from
worry
did
he
advise
that
yes
beaumaroy
admitted
he
did
that
the
only
thing
you
find
wrong
with
him
doctor
beaumaroy
was
standing
on
the
far
side
of
the
table
his
resting
lightly
on
it
he
looked
across
at
mary
with
eyes
candidly
inquiring
i
found
nothing
else
so
far
i
suppose
he
got
nothing
to
worry
him
not
really
i
think
he
fusses
a
bit
about
his
affairs
he
smiled
we
go
to
london
every
week
to
fuss
about
his
affairs
he
always
changing
his
investments
taking
his
money
out
of
one
thing
and
putting
it
in
another
you
know
old
people
get
like
that
sometimes
do
they
i
a
novice
at
that
kind
of
thing
never
having
had
any
money
to
play
with
but
i
bound
to
say
that
he
seems
to
know
very
well
what
he
about
do
you
know
anything
of
his
history
or
his
people
has
he
any
relations
i
know
very
little
i
do
think
he
has
any
any
real
relations
so
to
speak
there
are
i
believe
some
cousins
distant
cousins
whom
he
hates
in
fact
a
lonely
old
bachelor
dr
arkroyd
mary
gave
a
little
laugh
and
became
less
professional
he
rather
an
old
dear
he
uses
funny
stately
phrases
he
said
i
might
speak
quite
openly
to
you
as
you
were
closely
attached
to
his
person
sounds
rather
like
a
newspaper
does
it
he
does
talk
like
that
sometimes
beaumaroy
moved
round
the
table
came
close
to
the
fire
and
stood
there
smiling
down
at
mary
he
very
fond
of
you
i
think
she
went
on
he
reposes
entire
confidence
in
me
said
beaumaroy
with
a
touch
of
assumed
pompousness
those
were
his
very
words
cried
mary
laughing
again
and
he
said
it
just
in
that
way
how
clever
of
you
to
guess
not
so
very
he
says
it
to
me
six
times
a
week
mary
had
risen
about
to
take
her
leave
but
to
her
surprise
beaumaroy
went
on
quickly
with
one
of
his
confidential
smiles
and
now
i
going
to
show
you
that
i
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
you
please
sit
down
again
arkroyd
the
matter
concerns
your
patient
just
as
much
as
myself
or
i
would
trouble
you
with
it
at
any
rate
i
venture
to
so
early
in
our
acquaintance
i
want
you
to
consider
yourself
as
saffron
medical
adviser
and
also
to
try
to
imagine
yourself
my
friend
i
every
inclination
to
be
your
friend
but
i
hardly
know
you
mr
beaumaroy
and
feel
a
few
doubts
about
me
from
what
you
heard
from
myself
and
perhaps
from
others
the
wind
swished
outside
save
for
that
the
little
room
seemed
very
still
the
professional
character
of
the
interview
did
not
save
it
for
mary
arkroyd
from
a
sudden
and
rather
unwelcome
sense
of
intimacy
of
an
intimacy
thrust
upon
her
though
not
so
much
by
her
companion
as
by
circumstances
she
answered
rather
stiffly
perhaps
i
have
some
doubts
you
detect
very
acutely
that
i
have
a
great
influence
over
saffron
you
ask
very
properly
whether
he
has
relations
i
think
you
threw
out
a
feeler
about
his
money
affairs
whether
he
had
anything
to
worry
about
was
your
phrase
was
it
am
i
misinterpreting
what
was
in
your
mind
as
he
spoke
he
offered
her
a
cigarette
from
a
box
on
the
mantelpiece
she
took
one
and
lit
it
at
the
top
of
the
then
she
sat
down
again
in
the
big
chair
she
had
not
accepted
his
earlier
invitation
to
resume
her
seat
it
was
proper
for
me
to
put
those
questions
beaumaroy
saffron
is
not
a
sound
man
and
he
old
in
normal
conditions
his
relations
should
at
least
be
warned
of
the
position
exactly
beaumaroy
assented
with
an
appearance
of
eagerness
but
he
hates
them
any
suggestion
that
they
have
any
sort
of
claim
on
him
raises
strong
resentment
in
him
i
known
old
men
old
moneyed
men
like
that
before
and
no
doubt
you
have
well
now
you
begin
to
see
the
difficulty
of
my
position
i
put
the
case
to
you
quite
bluntly
suppose
saffron
having
this
liking
for
me
this
confidence
in
me
living
here
with
me
alone
except
for
servants
being
as
one
might
say
exposed
to
my
influence
suppose
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
make
a
will
in
my
favor
to
leave
me
all
his
money
it
quite
a
considerable
sum
so
far
as
our
wednesday
doings
enable
me
to
judge
suppose
that
happened
how
should
i
stand
in
your
opinion
arkroyd
but
wait
a
moment
still
suppose
that
my
career
has
not
been
very
well
resplendent
that
my
army
record
is
only
that
i
devoted
myself
to
him
with
remarkable
assiduity
as
in
fact
i
have
that
i
might
be
called
quite
plausibly
an
adventurer
well
propounding
that
will
how
should
i
stand
before
the
world
and
if
necessary
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
court
mary
sat
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
beaumaroy
knelt
down
by
the
fire
rearranged
the
logs
of
wood
which
were
smouldering
there
and
put
on
a
couple
more
from
that
position
looking
into
the
grate
he
added
and
the
change
of
doctors
it
was
he
of
course
who
insisted
on
it
but
i
can
see
a
clever
lawyer
using
that
against
me
too
ca
you
dr
arkroyd
i
sure
i
wish
you
had
had
to
make
the
change
exclaimed
mary
so
do
i
though
mind
you
i
not
pretending
that
irechester
is
a
favorite
of
mine
any
more
than
he
is
of
my
old
friend
still
there
it
is
i
no
right
perhaps
to
press
my
question
but
your
opinion
would
be
of
real
value
to
me
i
see
no
reason
to
think
that
he
not
quite
competent
to
make
a
will
said
doctor
mary
and
no
real
reason
why
he
should
prefer
you
to
distant
relations
whom
he
dislikes
ah
no
real
reason
that
what
you
say
you
mean
that
people
would
impute
mary
arkroyd
had
her
limitations
of
experience
of
knowledge
of
intuition
but
she
did
not
lack
courage
i
have
given
you
my
professional
opinion
it
is
that
so
far
as
i
see
saffron
is
of
perfectly
sound
understanding
and
capable
of
making
a
valid
will
you
did
me
the
honor
no
no
he
interrupted
in
a
low
but
rather
strangely
vehement
protest
i
begged
the
favor
as
you
like
the
favor
then
of
asking
me
to
give
you
my
opinion
as
your
friend
as
well
as
my
view
as
saffron
doctor
beaumaroy
did
not
rise
from
his
knees
but
turned
his
face
towards
her
the
logs
had
blazed
up
and
his
eyes
looked
curiously
bright
in
the
glare
themselves
as
it
were
afire
in
my
opinion
a
man
of
sensitive
honor
would
prefer
that
that
will
should
not
be
made
beaumaroy
said
mary
steadily
beaumaroy
appeared
to
consider
i
a
bit
posed
by
that
point
of
view
arkroyd
he
said
at
last
either
the
old
man
sane
mentis
do
you
call
it
or
he
is
if
he
is
i
know
but
i
feel
that
way
about
it
you
have
to
give
evidence
for
me
he
raised
his
brows
and
smiled
at
her
there
can
be
undue
influence
without
actual
want
of
mental
competence
i
think
i
do
know
whether
my
influence
is
undue
i
believe
i
the
only
creature
alive
who
cares
twopence
for
the
poor
old
gentleman
i
know
i
know
beaumaroy
your
position
is
very
difficult
i
see
that
it
really
is
but
would
you
take
the
money
for
yourself
you
well
rather
in
the
position
of
a
trustee
who
for
the
hated
cousins
what
the
reason
in
that
they
may
be
very
good
people
really
old
men
take
fancies
as
you
said
yourself
and
they
may
have
built
on
stepping
into
a
dead
man
shoes
i
dare
say
why
may
i
build
on
it
too
why
not
my
hand
against
the
other
fellow
that
what
you
learnt
from
the
war
you
said
so
at
old
place
captain
naylor
said
something
different
suppose
alec
naylor
and
i
a
hero
and
a
damaged
article
he
smiled
at
mary
and
she
smiled
back
with
a
sudden
enjoyment
of
the
humorous
yet
bitter
tang
in
his
voice
loved
the
same
woman
and
i
had
a
chance
of
her
am
i
to
give
it
up
really
we
getting
a
long
way
from
medicine
mr
beaumaroy
oh
you
a
general
practitioner
wise
on
all
subjects
under
heaven
conceive
yourself
hesitating
between
him
and
me
mary
laughed
frankly
how
absurd
you
are
if
you
must
go
on
talking
talk
seriously
but
why
am
i
absurd
because
if
i
were
a
marrying
woman
which
i
not
i
should
hesitate
between
you
and
captain
naylor
not
for
a
minute
you
jump
at
me
laughing
again
his
eyes
had
now
a
schoolboy
merriment
in
them
mary
rose
from
the
big
chair
at
him
if
i
not
being
impolite
mr
beaumaroy
they
stood
face
to
face
for
the
first
time
for
several
years
girlhood
had
not
been
altogether
empty
of
sentimental
episodes
she
blushed
under
a
man
glance
because
it
was
a
man
at
this
event
of
which
she
was
acutely
conscious
and
at
which
she
was
intensely
irritated
she
drew
herself
up
with
an
attempt
to
return
to
her
strictly
professional
manner
i
do
find
you
the
least
impolite
arkroyd
said
beaumaroy
it
was
impudent
yet
gay
dexterous
and
elusive
enough
to
avoid
reproof
with
no
more
than
a
little
shake
of
her
head
and
a
light
yet
embarrassed
laugh
mary
moved
toward
the
door
her
way
lying
between
the
table
and
an
old
oak
sideboard
which
stood
against
the
wall
some
plates
knives
and
other
articles
of
the
table
lay
strewn
none
too
tidily
about
it
beaumaroy
followed
her
smiling
complacently
his
hands
in
his
pockets
suddenly
mary
came
to
a
stop
and
pointed
with
her
finger
at
the
sideboard
turning
her
face
towards
her
companion
at
the
same
instant
beaumaroy
right
hand
shot
out
from
his
pocket
towards
the
sideboard
as
though
to
snatch
up
something
from
it
then
he
drew
the
hand
as
swiftly
back
again
but
his
eyes
watched
mary
with
an
alert
and
suspicious
gaze
that
was
for
a
second
only
then
his
face
resumed
its
amused
and
nonchalant
expression
but
the
movement
of
the
hand
and
the
look
of
the
eyes
had
not
escaped
mary
attention
her
voice
betrayed
some
surprise
as
she
said
it
only
that
i
just
happened
to
notice
that
combination
lying
there
and
i
wondered
who
the
article
in
question
lay
among
some
ordinary
knives
and
forks
it
was
of
a
kind
quite
familiar
to
doctor
mary
from
her
hospital
experience
a
fork
on
one
side
a
on
the
other
an
implement
made
for
people
who
could
command
the
use
of
only
one
hand
surely
you
noticed
my
hand
he
drew
his
right
hand
again
from
the
pocket
to
which
he
had
so
quickly
returned
it
i
used
to
use
that
in
hospital
when
i
was
bandaged
up
but
that
a
long
while
ago
now
and
i
ca
think
why
hooper
left
it
lying
there
the
account
was
plausible
and
entirely
the
same
might
now
be
said
of
his
face
and
manner
but
mary
had
seen
the
dart
of
his
hand
and
the
sudden
alertness
in
his
eyes
her
own
rested
on
him
for
a
moment
with
inquiry
for
the
first
time
with
a
hint
of
distrust
i
see
she
murmured
vaguely
and
turning
away
from
him
pursued
her
way
to
the
door
beaumaroy
followed
her
with
a
queer
smile
on
his
lips
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
once
very
slightly
a
constraint
had
fallen
on
mary
she
allowed
herself
to
be
escorted
to
the
car
and
helped
into
it
in
silence
beaumaroy
made
no
effort
to
force
the
talk
possibly
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
sergeant
hooper
who
had
arrived
back
from
the
chemist
with
the
medicine
for
saffron
just
as
mary
and
beaumaroy
came
out
of
the
hall
door
he
stood
by
his
bicycle
drawing
just
a
little
aside
to
let
them
pass
but
not
far
enough
to
prevent
the
light
from
the
passage
showing
up
his
countenance
well
arkroyd
i
see
how
he
is
and
ask
you
to
be
kind
enough
to
call
again
if
it
seems
advisable
and
a
thousand
thanks
mr
beaumaroy
she
started
the
car
beaumaroy
walked
back
to
the
hall
door
mary
glanced
behind
her
once
and
saw
him
standing
by
it
again
framed
by
the
light
behind
him
as
she
had
seen
him
on
her
arrival
but
this
time
within
the
four
corners
of
the
same
frame
was
included
the
forbidding
visage
of
sergeant
hooper
beaumaroy
returned
to
the
fire
in
the
parlor
hooper
leaving
his
bicycle
in
the
passage
followed
him
into
the
room
and
put
the
medicine
bottle
on
the
table
smiling
at
him
beaumaroy
pointed
at
the
combination
is
it
your
fault
or
mine
that
that
damned
thing
lying
there
he
asked
yours
answered
the
sergeant
without
hesitation
and
with
his
habitual
surliness
i
cleaned
it
and
put
it
out
for
you
to
lock
away
as
usual
suppose
you
went
and
forgot
it
sir
beaumaroy
shook
his
head
in
and
a
humorous
dismay
that
it
i
went
and
forgot
it
sergeant
and
i
think
i
rather
think
that
doctor
mary
smells
a
rat
though
she
is
at
present
far
from
guessing
the
color
of
the
animal
the
words
sounded
scornful
they
were
spoken
for
the
sergeant
as
well
as
for
himself
he
was
looking
amused
and
kindly
even
rather
tenderly
amused
as
though
liking
and
pity
were
the
emotions
which
most
actively
survived
his
first
private
conversation
with
doctor
mary
in
spite
of
that
mishap
of
the
combination
chapter
vi
odd
story
of
captain
duggle
christmas
day
of
was
a
merry
feast
and
nowhere
merrier
than
at
old
place
there
was
a
and
for
dinner
on
the
day
itself
a
local
contingent
as
well
miss
wall
the
irechesters
penrose
and
doctor
mary
beaumaroy
also
had
been
invited
by
naylor
she
considered
him
an
interesting
man
and
felt
pity
for
the
obvious
of
his
situation
but
he
had
not
felt
able
to
leave
his
old
friend
doctor
mary
paying
guest
was
of
the
not
merely
a
dinner
guest
she
was
asked
over
to
spend
three
days
and
went
accompanied
by
jeanne
who
by
this
time
was
crying
much
less
crying
was
no
longer
the
cue
her
mistress
and
not
merely
stern
doctor
mary
had
plainly
shown
her
that
gertie
naylor
had
invited
cynthia
to
help
her
in
entertaining
the
subalterns
though
gertie
was
really
quite
equal
to
that
task
herself
there
were
only
three
of
them
and
if
a
pretty
girl
is
not
equal
to
three
subalterns
well
what
are
we
coming
to
in
england
and
as
it
turned
out
miss
gertie
had
to
deal
with
them
all
sometimes
collectively
sometimes
one
by
one
practically
unassisted
cynthia
was
otherwise
engaged
gertie
complained
neither
of
the
cause
nor
of
its
consequence
the
drink
or
drugs
hypothesis
was
exploded
and
miss
speculations
set
at
rest
with
a
quite
comforting
solatium
of
romantic
and
unhappy
interest
a
nice
for
the
old
cat
as
naylor
unkindly
put
it
cynthia
had
told
her
story
she
wanted
a
richer
sympathy
than
doctor
mary
afforded
out
of
this
need
the
revelation
came
to
gertie
in
innocent
confidence
and
with
the
narrator
tacit
approval
ran
through
the
family
and
its
intimate
friends
if
cynthia
had
been
as
calculating
as
she
was
guileless
she
could
not
have
done
better
for
herself

motherliness
old
naylor
courtliness
gertie
breathless
concern
and
avid
appetite
for
the
fullest
detail
everybody
desire
to
console
and
cheer
all
these
were
at
her
service
all
enlisted
in
the
effort
to
make
her
forget
and
live
and
laugh
again
her
heart
responded
she
found
herself
becoming
happy
at
a
rate
which
made
her
positively
ashamed
no
wonder
tactful
jeanne
discovered
that
the
cue
was
changed
fastidious
old
naylor
regarded
his
wife
with
the
affection
of
habit
and
with
a
little
disdain
for
the
ordinariness
of
her
virtues
not
to
say
of
the
mind
which
they
adorned
his
daughter
was
to
him
a
precious
toy
on
which
he
tried
jokes
played
tricks
and
lavished
gifts
for
the
joy
of
seeing
the
prettiness
of
her
reactions
to
his
treatment
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
think
that
his
toy
might
be
broken
fond
as
he
was
his
feeling
for
her
lacked
the
apprehensiveness
of
the
deepest
love
but
he
idolized
his
son
and
in
this
case
neither
without
fear
nor
without
understanding
for
four
years
now
he
had
feared
for
him
bitterly
for
his
body
for
his
life
at
every
waking
hour
his
inner
cry
had
been
even
as
david
would
god
i
had
died
for
thee
my
son
my
son
for
at
every
moment
of
those
four
years
it
might
be
that
his
son
was
even
then
dead
that
terror
endured
under
a
cool
and
almost
demeanor
was
past
but
he
feared
for
his
son
still
of
all
who
went
to
the
war
as
crusaders
none
had
the
temperament
more
ardently
than
alec
as
he
went
so
obviously
he
had
come
back
not
disillusioned
nay
with
all
his
illusions
or
delusions
about
this
wicked
world
and
its
possibilities
about
the
people
who
dwell
in
it
and
their
lamentable
limitations
stronger
in
his
mind
than
ever
how
could
he
get
through
life
without
being
too
sorely
hurt
and
wounded
without
being
cut
to
the
very
quick
by
his
inevitable
discoveries
old
naylor
did
not
see
how
it
was
to
be
done
or
even
hoped
for
but
the
right
kind
of
wife
was
unquestionably
the
best
chance
he
had
cast
a
speculative
eye
on
cynthia
walford
irechester
had
caught
him
at
it
but
as
he
observed
her
more
she
did
not
altogether
satisfy
him
alec
needed
someone
more
stable
stronger
someone
in
a
sense
protective
somebody
more
like
mary
arkroyd
that
idea
passed
through
his
thoughts
if
only
mary
would
take
the
trouble
to
dress
herself
remember
that
she
was
or
might
be
made
an
attractive
young
woman
and
yes
throw
her
mortar
and
pestle
out
of
the
window
without
however
discarding
with
them
the
sturdy
sane
balanced
qualities
of
mind
which
enabled
her
to
handle
them
with
such
admirable
competence
but
he
soon
had
to
put
this
idea
from
him
his
son
own
impulse
was
to
give
not
to
seek
protection
and
support
of
cynthia
woeful
experience
alec
had
spoken
to
his
father
once
only
it
makes
me
mad
to
think
the
fellow
who
did
that
wore
a
british
uniform
how
unreasonable
since
by
all
the
laws
of
average
when
millions
of
men
are
wearing
a
uniform
there
must
be
some
rogues
in
it
but
it
was
way
to
hold
himself
responsible
for
the
whole
of
his
majesty
forces
their
honor
was
his
for
their
misdeeds
he
must
in
his
own
person
make
reparation
that
fellow
beaumaroy
may
have
lost
his
conscience
but
my
boy
seems
to
have
acquired
five
million
the
old
man
grumbled
to
himself
a
grumble
full
of
pride
the
father
might
analyze
with
alec
it
was
all
impulse
the
impulse
to
soothe
to
obliterate
to
atone
the
girl
had
been
sorely
hurt
with
the
acuteness
of
sympathy
he
divined
that
she
felt
herself
in
a
way
soiled
and
stained
by
contact
with
unworthiness
and
by
a
too
easy
acceptance
of
it
all
that
must
be
swept
out
of
her
heart
out
of
her
memory
if
it
could
be
doctor
mary
saw
what
was
happening
and
with
a
little
pang
to
which
she
would
not
have
liked
to
own
she
had
set
love
affairs
and
all
the
notions
connected
therewith
behind
her
but
she
had
idealized
alec
naylor
a
little
and
she
thought
cynthia
in
homely
phrase
hardly
good
enough
was
it
not
rather
perverse
that
the
very
fact
of
having
been
a
little
goose
should
help
her
to
win
so
rare
a
swan
you
taking
my
patient
out
of
my
hands
captain
alec
she
said
to
him
jokingly
and
you
devoting
great
attention
to
the
case
he
flushed
she
seems
to
like
to
talk
to
me
he
answered
simply
she
seems
to
me
to
have
rather
a
remarkable
mind
doctor
mary
she
was
doctor
mary
to
all
the
old
place
party
now
in
affection
with
a
touch
of
chaff
sancta
mary
longed
to
say
that
cynthia
was
a
very
ordinary
child
like
to
talk
to
him
indeed
of
course
she
did
and
to
use
her
girl
weapons
on
him
and
to
wonder
in
an
almost
awestruck
delight
at
their
effect
on
this
dazzling
hero
well
the
guilelessness
of
heroes
so
mused
mary
on
the
unprofessional
side
of
her
mind
as
she
watched
that
christmastide
captain
alec
delicate
sensitively
indirect
and
delayed
approach
toward
the
ripe
fruit
that
hung
so
ready
to
his
hand
part
of
his
chivalry
to
assume
she
ca
think
of
him
yet
mary
was
admiring
not
an
uncommon
mixture
of
feeling
for
the
extreme
forms
of
virtue
to
produce
in
the
net
result
however
her
marked
image
of
alec
lost
something
of
its
heroic
proportions
but
professionally
the
distinction
must
not
be
pushed
too
far
she
was
not
built
in
watertight
compartments
tower
cottage
remained
obstinately
in
the
center
of
her
thoughts
and
connected
with
it
there
arose
a
puzzle
over
irechester
demeanor
she
had
taken
advantage
of
beaumaroy
permission
though
rather
doubtful
whether
she
was
doing
right
for
she
was
still
inexperienced
in
niceties
of
etiquette
and
sent
on
the
letter
with
a
frank
note
explaining
her
own
feelings
and
the
reason
which
had
caused
her
to
pay
her
visit
to
saffron
but
though
irechester
was
quite
friendly
when
they
met
at
old
place
before
dinner
and
talked
freely
to
her
during
a
rather
prolonged
period
of
waiting
captain
alec
and
cynthia
gertie
and
two
subalterns
were
very
late
having
apparently
forgotten
dinner
in
more
refined
delights
he
made
no
reference
to
the
letters
nor
to
tower
cottage
or
its
inmates
mary
herself
was
too
shy
to
break
the
ice
but
wondered
at
his
silence
and
the
more
because
the
matter
evidently
had
not
gone
out
of
his
mind
for
after
dinner
when
the
port
had
gone
round
once
and
the
proper
healths
been
honored
he
said
across
the
table
to
penrose
we
were
talking
the
other
day
of
the
tower
on
the
heath
you
know
by
old
saffron
cottage
and
none
of
us
knew
its
history
you
know
all
about
inkston
from
time
out
o
mind
have
you
got
any
story
about
it
penrose
practiced
as
a
solicitor
in
london
but
lived
in
a
little
old
house
near
the
irechesters
in
the
village
street
and
devoted
his
leisure
to
the
antiquities
and
topography
of
the
neighborhood
his
lore
was
plentiful
and
curious
if
not
important
he
was
a
small
neat
old
fellow
with
white
whiskers
of
the
antique
cut
a
thin
voice
and
a
dry
cackling
laugh
there
was
a
story
about
it
and
one
quite
fit
for
christmas
evening
if
you
in
the
mood
to
hear
it
the
thin
voice
was
penetrating
at
the
promise
of
a
story
silence
fell
on
the
company
and
penrose
told
his
tale
vouching
as
his
authority
an
erstwhile
oldest
inhabitant
now
gathered
to
his
fathers
for
the
tale
dated
back
some
eighty
years
to
the
date
of
the
ancient
early
manhood
a
seafaring
man
had
suddenly
appeared
out
of
space
as
it
were
at
inkston
and
taken
the
cottage
he
carried
with
him
a
strong
smell
of
rum
and
tobacco
and
gave
it
to
be
understood
that
his
name
was
captain
duggle
he
was
no
beauty
and
his
behavior
was
worse
than
his
looks
to
that
quiet
village
in
those
quiet
times
he
was
a
horror
and
a
portent
he
not
only
drank
prodigiously
that
being
in
character
and
also
a
source
of
local
profit
might
have
passed
with
mild
censure
but
he
swore
and
blasphemed
horribly
spurning
the
parson
mocking
at
revelation
even
at
the
deity
himself
the
devil
was
his
friend
he
said
a
most
terrible
fellow
this
captain
duggle
hair
stood
on
end
and
no
wonder
no
doubt
they
shivered
with
delight
over
it
all
commented
naylor
captain
duggle
lived
all
by
himself
well
what
christian
male
or
female
would
be
found
to
live
with
him
came
and
went
mysteriously
and
capriciously
always
full
of
money
and
at
least
equally
full
of
drink
what
he
did
with
himself
nobody
knew
but
evil
legends
gathered
about
him
terrified
wayfarers
passing
the
cottage
by
night
took
oath
that
they
had
heard
more
than
one
voice
this
is
proper
christmas
a
subaltern
interjected
into
gertie
ear
penrose
with
an
air
of
gratification
continued
his
narrative
the
story
goes
on
to
tell
he
said
of
a
final
interview
with
the
village
clergyman
in
which
that
reverend
man
as
in
duty
bound
solemnly
told
captain
duggle
that
however
much
he
might
curse
and
blaspheme
and
drink
and
er
do
all
the
other
things
that
the
captain
did
obviously
here
penrose
felt
hampered
by
the
presence
of
ladies
yet
death
judgment
and
churchyard
wait
for
him
at
last
whereupon
the
captain
emitting
an
inconceivably
terrific
imprecation
which
no
one
ever
dared
to
repeat
and
which
consequently
is
lost
to
tradition
declared
that
the
first
he
never
feared
the
second
was
parson
gabble
and
as
to
the
third
never
should
his
dead
toes
be
nearer
any
church
than
for
the
last
forty
years
his
living
feet
had
been
if
so
be
as
he
was
drowned
at
sea
he
make
a
grave
for
himself
penrose
paused
sipped
port
wine
and
resumed
and
so
no
doubt
he
did
building
the
tower
for
that
purpose
by
bribes
and
threats
he
got
two
men
to
work
for
him
one
was
the
uncle
of
my
informant
but
though
he
built
that
tower
and
inside
it
dug
his
grave
he
never
lay
there
being
as
things
turned
out
carried
off
by
the
devil
oh
yes
there
was
no
doubt
he
went
home
one
night
a
saturday
very
drunk
as
usual
on
the
sunday
night
a
belated
wayfarer
possibly
also
drunk
heard
wild
shrieks
and
saw
a
strange
red
glow
through
the
window
of
the
tower
now
by
the
way
boarded
up
and
no
doubt
he
have
smelt
brimstone
if
the
wind
had
set
the
wrong
way
anyhow
captain
duggle
was
never
seen
again
by
mortal
eyes
at
inkston
at
all
events
after
a
time
the
landlord
of
the
cottage
screwed
up
his
courage
to
resume
possession
the
captain
had
only
a
lease
of
it
though
he
built
the
tower
at
his
own
charges
and
i
believe
without
any
permission
the
landlord
being
much
too
frightened
to
interfere
with
him
he
found
everything
in
a
sad
mess
in
the
house
while
in
the
tower
itself
every
blessed
stick
had
been
burnt
up
so
the
story
looks
pretty
plausible
and
the
grave
this
question
came
eagerly
from
at
least
three
of
the
company
in
front
of
the
fireplace
there
was
a
big
oblong
hole
six
feet
by
three
by
four
planks
at
the
bottom
the
sides
roughly
lined
with
brick
captain
duggle
grave
but
he
was
in
it
but
what
really
became
of
him
mr
penrose
cried
cynthia
the
rising
generation
is
very
skeptical
said
old
naylor
you
of
course
penrose
believe
the
story
i
do
said
penrose
composedly
i
believe
that
a
devil
carried
him
off
and
that
its
name
was
we
can
guess
ca
we
irechester
why
he
smashed
or
burnt
everything
and
fled
in
mad
terror
into
the
darkness
where
to
was
he
drowned
at
sea
or
did
he
take
his
life
or
did
he
rot
to
death
in
some
filthy
hole
nobody
knows
but
the
grave
he
dug
is
there
in
the
tower
unless
it
been
filled
up
since
old
saffron
has
lived
there
why
in
the
world
was
it
filled
up
before
asked
alec
naylor
with
a
laugh
people
lived
in
the
cottage
did
they
i
visited
the
cottage
often
irechester
interposed
when
various
people
had
it
but
i
never
saw
any
signs
of
the
tower
being
used
it
never
was
i
sure
and
as
for
the
grave
well
alec
in
country
parts
to
this
day
you
be
thought
a
bold
man
if
you
filled
up
a
grave
that
your
neighbor
had
dug
for
himself
and
such
a
neighbor
as
captain
duggle
he
might
take
it
into
his
head
some
night
to
visit
it
and
if
he
found
it
filled
up
there
be
trouble
nasty
trouble
his
laugh
cackled
out
rather
uncomfortably
gertie
shivered
and
one
of
the
subalterns
gulped
down
his
port
old
saffron
a
man
of
education
i
believe
no
doubt
he
pays
no
heed
to
such
nonsense
and
has
had
the
thing
covered
up
said
naylor
as
to
that
i
do
know
perhaps
you
do
irechester
he
your
patient
is
he
irechester
sat
four
places
from
mary
before
he
replied
to
the
question
he
cast
a
glance
at
her
smiling
rather
mockingly
attended
him
on
one
or
two
occasions
but
i
never
seen
the
inside
of
the
tower
so
i
do
know
either
oh
but
i
curious
i
shall
ask
beaumaroy
cried
cynthia
the
ironical
character
of
irechester
smile
grew
more
pronounced
and
his
voice
was
at
its
driest
certainly
you
can
ask
beaumaroy
miss
walford
as
far
as
asking
goes
there
no
difficulty
a
pause
followed
this
pointed
remark
on
which
nobody
seemed
disposed
to
comment
naylor
ended
the
session
by
rising
from
her
chair
but
mary
arkroyd
was
disquieted
worried
as
to
how
she
stood
with
irechester
vaguely
but
insistently
worried
over
the
whole
tower
cottage
business
well
the
first
point
she
could
soon
settle
or
try
to
settle
anyhow
with
the
directness
which
marked
her
action
when
once
her
mind
was
made
up
she
waylaid
irechester
as
he
came
into
the
her
resolute
approach
sufficed
to
detach
naylor
from
him
he
found
himself
for
the
moment
isolated
from
everybody
except
mary
you
got
my
letter
irechester
i
i
rather
expected
an
answer
your
conduct
was
so
obviously
and
punctiliously
correct
he
replied
suavely
that
i
thought
my
answer
could
wait
till
i
met
you
here
as
i
knew
that
i
was
to
have
the
pleasure
of
doing
he
looked
her
full
in
the
eyes
you
were
placed
my
dear
colleague
in
a
position
in
which
you
had
no
alternative
i
thought
so
irechester
but
oh
yes
clearly
i
far
from
making
any
complaint
he
gave
her
a
courteous
little
bow
but
it
was
one
which
plainly
closed
the
subject
indeed
he
passed
by
her
and
joined
a
group
that
had
gathered
on
the
hearthrug
leaving
her
alone
so
she
stood
for
a
minute
oppressed
by
a
growing
uneasiness
irechester
said
nothing
but
surely
meant
something
of
import
he
mocked
her
but
not
idly
or
out
of
wantonness
he
seemed
almost
to
warn
her
what
could
there
be
to
warn
her
about
he
had
laid
an
odd
emphasis
on
the
word
placed
he
had
repeated
it
who
had
placed
her
there
saffron
or
alec
naylor
broke
in
on
her
uneasy
meditation
it
a
clinking
night
doctor
mary
he
observed
do
you
mind
if
i
walk
miss
walford
home
instead
of
her
going
with
you
in
your
car
you
know
it
only
a
couple
of
miles
and
do
you
think
your
leg
can
stand
it
he
laughed
i
cut
the
thing
off
if
it
dares
to
make
any
objection
chapter
vii
a
gentlemanly
stranger
on
this
same
christmas
day
sergeant
hooper
was
feeling
morose
and
discontented
not
because
he
was
alone
in
the
world
a
situation
comprising
many
advantages
nor
on
the
score
of
his
wages
which
were
extremely
liberal
nor
on
account
of
the
old
blighter
that
is
saffron
occasional
outbursts
of
temper
these
being
in
the
nature
of
the
case
and
within
the
terms
of
the
contract
nor
finally
by
reason
of
beaumaroy
airy
insolence
since
from
his
youth
up
the
sergeant
was
hardened
to
unfavorable
comments
on
his
personal
appearance
trifling
vulgarities
which
a
man
of
sense
could
afford
to
ignore
no
the
winter
of
his
discontent
a
bitter
winter
was
due
to
the
conviction
which
had
been
growing
in
his
mind
for
some
time
that
he
was
only
in
half
the
secret
and
that
not
the
more
profitable
half
he
knew
that
the
old
blighter
had
to
be
humored
in
certain
small
ways
as
for
example
in
regard
to
the
combination
and
the
reason
for
it
but
first
he
did
not
know
what
happened
inside
the
tower
he
had
never
seen
the
inside
of
it
the
door
was
always
locked
he
was
never
invited
to
accompany
his
masters
when
they
repaired
thither
by
day
and
he
was
not
on
the
premises
by
night
and
secondly
he
did
not
understand
the
wednesday
journeys
to
london
and
he
had
never
seen
the
inside
of
beaumaroy
brown
bag
that
like
the
tower
door
was
always
locked
he
had
handled
it
once
just
before
the
pair
set
out
for
london
one
wednesday
beaumaroy
a
careless
man
sometimes
in
spite
of
the
cunning
which
irechester
attributed
to
him
had
left
it
on
the
parlor
table
while
he
helped
saffron
on
with
his
coat
in
the
passage
and
the
sergeant
had
swiftly
and
surreptitiously
lifted
it
up
it
was
very
light
obviously
empty
or
at
all
events
holding
only
featherweight
contents
he
had
never
got
near
it
when
it
came
back
from
town
then
it
always
went
straight
into
the
tower
and
had
the
key
turned
on
it
forthwith
but
the
sergeant
although
as
well
as
ugly
had
had
his
experiences
he
had
carried
weights
both
in
the
army
and
in
other
institutions
which
are
officially
described
as
his
majesty
and
had
seen
other
men
carry
them
too
from
the
set
of
beaumaroy
figure
as
he
arrived
home
on
at
least
two
occasions
with
the
brown
bag
and
from
the
way
in
which
he
handled
it
the
sergeant
confidently
drew
the
conclusion
that
it
was
of
a
considerable
almost
a
grievous
weight
what
was
the
heavy
thing
in
it
what
became
of
that
thing
after
it
was
taken
into
the
tower
to
whose
use
or
profit
did
it
or
was
it
to
inure
certainly
it
was
plain
even
to
the
meanest
capacity
that
the
contents
of
the
bag
had
a
value
in
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
who
went
to
london
for
them
and
who
shepherded
them
from
london
to
the
custody
of
the
tower
these
thoughts
filled
and
racked
his
brain
as
he
sat
drinking
rum
and
water
in
the
bar
of
the
on
christmas
evening
a
solitary
man
mixing
little
with
the
people
of
the
village
he
sat
apart
at
a
small
table
in
the
corner
musing
within
himself
yet
idly
watching
the
company
villagers
a
few
friends
from
london
and
elsewhere
some
soldiers
and
their
ladies
besides
these
a
tall
slim
man
stood
leaning
against
the
bar
at
the
far
end
of
it
talking
to
bill
smithers
the
landlord
and
sipping
between
pulls
at
his
cigar
he
wore
a
neat
dark
overcoat
brown
shoes
and
a
bowler
hat
rather
on
one
side
his
appearance
was
in
fact
genteel
though
his
air
was
a
trifle
raffish
in
age
he
seemed
about
forty
the
sergeant
had
never
seen
him
before
and
therefore
favored
him
with
a
glance
of
special
attention
oddly
enough
the
gentlemanly
stranger
seemed
to
reciprocate
the
sergeant
interest
he
gave
him
quite
a
long
glance
then
he
finished
his
spoke
a
word
to
bill
smithers
and
lounged
across
the
room
to
where
the
sergeant
sat
it
poor
work
drinking
alone
on
christmas
night
he
observed
may
i
join
you
i
ordered
a
little
something
and
well
we
need
bother
about
offering
a
gentleman
a
glass
tonight
the
sergeant
eyed
him
with
apparent
disfavor
as
indeed
he
did
everybody
who
approached
him
but
a
nod
of
his
head
accorded
the
desired
permission
smithers
came
across
with
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
glasses
good
stuff
said
the
stranger
as
he
sat
down
filled
the
glasses
and
drank
his
off
the
best
thing
to
top
up
with
believe
me
the
sergeant
in
turn
drained
his
glass
maintaining
however
his
aloofness
of
demeanor
what
up
he
growled
what
in
the
brown
bag
asked
the
stranger
lightly
and
urbanely
the
sergeant
did
not
start
he
was
too
old
a
hand
for
that
but
his
small
gimlet
eyes
searched
his
new
acquaintance
face
very
keenly
you
know
a
lot
more
than
you
do
in
some
directions
less
in
others
perhaps
shall
i
begin
because
we
got
to
confide
in
one
another
sergeant
a
little
story
of
what
two
gentlemen
do
in
london
on
wednesdays
and
of
what
they
carry
home
in
a
brown
leather
bag
would
that
interest
you
oh
that
stuff
in
the
brown
leather
bag
hard
to
come
by
now
is
it
but
they
know
where
there
still
some
and
so
do
i
to
remark
it
incidentally
there
were
actually
some
people
sergeant
hooper
who
distrusted
the
righteousness
of
the
british
cause
which
is
to
say
the
stranger
smiled
cynically
the
certainty
of
our
licking
the
germans
and
they
hoarded
it
the
villains
sergeant
hooper
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
the
bottle
allow
me
said
the
stranger
politely
i
observe
that
your
hand
trembles
a
little
it
did
the
sergeant
was
excited
the
stranger
seemed
to
be
touching
on
a
subject
which
always
excited
the
sergeant
to
the
point
of
hands
trembling
twitching
and
itching
have
to
pay
for
it
too
thirty
bob
in
for
every
ruddy
disc
that
the
figure
now
or
thereabouts
what
do
they
want
to
do
it
for
what
your
governor
game
who
in
short
is
going
to
get
off
with
it
what
is
it
they
does
the
old
blighter
and
boomery
thus
he
pronounced
the
name
beaumaroy
in
london
first
to
the
stockbroker
then
to
a
bank
or
two
i
known
it
three
even
then
a
taxi
down
east
and
a
call
at
certain
addresses
the
with
sergeant
and
at
each
call
it
gets
heavier
i
seen
it
swell
so
to
speak
who
in
hell
are
you
the
sergeant
grunted
huskily
names
later
after
the
usual
guarantees
of
good
faith
the
whole
conversation
carried
on
in
low
tones
had
passed
under
cover
of
noisy
mirth
snatches
of
song
banter
and
gigglings
nobody
paid
heed
to
the
two
men
talking
in
a
corner
yet
the
stranger
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
as
he
added
from
me
to
you
fifty
quid
on
account
from
you
to
me
just
a
sight
of
the
place
where
they
put
it
sergeant
hooper
drank
smoked
and
pondered
the
stranger
showed
the
edge
of
a
roll
of
notes
protruding
it
from
his
the
sergeant
nodded
he
understood
that
part
but
there
was
much
that
he
did
not
understand
it
fair
beats
me
what
the
blazes
they
doing
it
he
broke
out
whose
money
would
it
be
the
old
blighter
o
course
boomery
stony
except
for
his
screw
he
looked
hard
at
the
gentlemanly
stranger
and
a
slow
smile
came
on
his
lips
that
your
idea
is
it
mister
gentleman
old
looks
frail
might
go
off
suddenly
what
then
friends
turn
up
always
do
when
you
dead
you
know
well
what
of
it
less
money
in
the
funds
than
was
reckoned
dear
old
gentleman
does
cut
up
as
well
as
they
hoped
and
meanwhile
our
friend
b
does
it
dawn
on
you
at
all
from
our
friend
b
point
of
view
sergeant
i
may
be
wrong
but
that
my
provisional
conjecture
the
question
remains
how
he
got
the
old
gent
into
the
game
does
it
precisely
the
point
to
which
the
sergeant
mind
also
had
turned
the
knowledge
which
he
possessed
that
half
of
the
secret
and
which
his
companion
did
not
might
be
very
material
to
a
solution
of
the
problem
the
sergeant
did
not
mean
to
share
it
prematurely
without
necessity
or
for
nothing
but
surely
it
had
a
bearing
on
the
case
as
he
was
the
sergeant
seemed
to
catch
a
glimmer
of
light
and
mentally
groped
towards
it
well
we
ca
sit
here
all
night
said
the
stranger
in
impatience
i
a
train
to
catch
there
no
train
up
from
here
there
is
from
sprotsfield
i
shall
walk
over
the
sergeant
smiled
oh
if
you
walking
to
sprotsfield
i
put
you
on
your
way
if
anybody
was
to
see
us
boomery
for
instance
he
complain
of
my
seeing
an
old
pal
on
his
way
on
christmas
night
no
in
that
no
look
of
prowling
or
spying
or
such
like
and
you
are
an
old
pal
ai
you
certainly
your
old
pal
let
me
see
your
old
pal
percy
bennett
as
it
might
he
or
as
it
might
not
what
about
the
he
pointed
to
percy
bennett
i
give
it
you
outside
you
do
want
me
to
be
seen
handing
it
over
in
here
do
you
the
sergeant
had
one
more
question
to
ask
about
much
d
reckon
there
might
be
by
now
how
often
have
they
been
to
london
because
they
do
come
to
see
my
friends
every
time
i
fancy
must
been
six
or
seven
times
by
now
the
game
began
soon
after
boomery
and
i
came
then
quite
roughly
quite
a
shot
from
what
i
know
of
the
deals
we
my
friends
i
mean
did
with
them
and
reasoning
from
that
there
might
be
a
matter
of
seven
or
eight
thousand
pounds
the
sergeant
whistled
softly
rose
and
led
the
way
to
the
door
the
gentlemanly
stranger
paused
at
the
bar
to
pay
for
the
brandy
and
after
bidding
the
landlord
a
civil
with
the
compliments
of
the
season
followed
the
sergeant
into
the
village
street
fifteen
minutes
brisk
walk
brought
them
to
hinton
avenue
at
the
end
of
it
they
passed
doctor
mary
house
the
curtains
were
not
drawn
on
the
blind
they
saw
reflected
the
shadows
of
a
man
and
a
girl
standing
side
by
side
mistletoe
eh
remarked
the
stranger
the
sergeant
spat
on
the
road
they
resumed
their
way
pursuing
the
road
across
the
heath
it
was
fine
but
overclouded
and
decidedly
dark
every
now
and
then
bennett
to
call
the
stranger
by
what
was
almost
confessedly
a
flashed
a
powerful
electric
torch
on
the
roadway
do
want
to
walk
into
a
he
explained
with
a
laugh
put
it
away
you
darned
fool
we
nearly
there
the
stranger
obeyed
in
another
seven
or
eight
minutes
there
loomed
up
on
the
left
hand
the
dim
outline
of
saffron
abode
the
square
cottage
with
the
odd
round
tower
annexed
there
you
are
the
sergeant
voice
instinctively
kept
to
a
whisper
that
what
you
want
to
see
but
i
ca
see
it
not
so
as
to
get
any
clear
idea
no
lights
showed
from
the
cottage
nor
of
course
from
the
tower
its
only
window
had
been
as
penrose
said
boarded
up
the
wind
there
was
generally
a
wind
on
the
heath
stirred
the
and
the
bushes
into
a
soft
movement
and
a
faint
murmur
of
sound
a
very
acute
and
alert
ear
might
perhaps
have
caught
another
sound
footfalls
on
the
road
a
good
long
way
behind
them
the
two
spies
or
scouts
did
not
hear
them
their
attention
was
elsewhere
probably
they
both
in
bed
it
quite
safe
to
make
our
examination
said
the
stranger
yes
i
it
is
but
look
to
be
ready
to
douse
your
glim
a
nailer
at
turning
up
unexpected
the
sergeant
seemed
rather
nervous
bennett
was
not
he
took
out
his
torch
and
guided
by
its
light
which
however
he
took
care
not
to
throw
towards
the
cottage
windows
he
advanced
to
the
garden
gate
the
sergeant
following
and
took
a
survey
of
the
premises
it
was
remarkable
that
as
the
light
of
the
torch
beamed
out
the
faint
sound
of
footfalls
on
the
road
behind
died
away
keep
an
eye
on
the
windows
and
touch
my
elbow
if
any
light
shows
speak
the
stranger
was
at
business
his
business
now
and
his
voice
became
correspondingly
businesslike
we
wo
risk
going
inside
the
gate
i
can
see
from
here
indeed
he
very
well
could
tower
cottage
stood
back
no
more
than
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
from
the
road
and
the
torch
was
powerful
for
four
or
five
minutes
the
stranger
made
his
examination
then
he
turned
off
his
torch
looks
easy
he
remarked
but
of
course
the
garrison
once
more
he
turned
on
his
light
to
look
at
his
watch
ca
stop
now
or
i
shall
miss
the
train
and
i
do
want
to
have
to
get
a
bed
at
sprotsfield
a
strayed
reveler
on
christmas
night
might
be
too
well
remembered
got
an
address
care
of
willnough
laundress
inkston
right
with
a
quick
turn
he
was
off
along
the
road
to
sprotsfield
the
sergeant
saw
the
gleam
of
his
torch
once
or
twice
receding
at
quite
a
surprising
pace
into
the
distance
feeling
the
wad
of
notes
in
his
pocket
perhaps
to
make
sure
that
the
whole
episode
had
not
been
a
dream
the
sergeant
turned
back
towards
inkston
after
a
couple
of
minutes
a
tall
figure
emerged
from
the
shelter
of
a
high
and
thick
gorse
bush
just
opposite
tower
cottage
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
captain
alec
naylor
had
seen
the
light
of
the
torch
and
after
four
years
in
france
he
was
well
skilled
in
the
art
of
noiseless
approach
but
he
felt
that
for
the
moment
at
least
his
brain
was
less
agile
than
his
feet
he
had
been
suddenly
wrenched
out
of
one
set
of
thoughts
into
another
profoundly
different
it
was
his
shadow
together
with
cynthia
walford
that
the
sergeant
and
the
stranger
had
seen
on
doctor
mary
blind
after
walking
her
home
he
had
well
just
not
proposed
to
cynthia
restrained
more
by
those
scruples
of
his
than
by
any
ungraciousness
on
the
part
of
the
lady
even
his
modesty
could
not
blind
him
to
this
fact
he
was
full
of
pity
of
love
of
a
man
joyous
sense
of
triumph
half
wishing
that
he
had
made
his
proposal
half
glad
that
he
had
not
just
because
it
and
its
radiant
promise
could
still
be
dangled
in
the
bright
vision
of
the
future
he
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
romance
and
his
heaven
was
higher
than
that
which
most
men
reach
it
was
built
on
loftier
foundations
then
came
the
flash
of
the
torch
the
high
spirits
born
of
one
experience
sought
an
outlet
in
another
by
jove
i
track
like
old
times
he
murmured
with
a
low
light
laugh
and
just
for
fun
he
did
it
taking
to
the
heath
beside
the
road
twisting
his
long
body
in
and
out
amongst
gorse
heather
and
bracken
very
noiselessly
with
wonderful
dexterity
the
light
of
the
lamp
was
continuous
now
the
stranger
was
making
his
examination
by
it
captain
alec
guided
his
steps
and
he
arrived
behind
the
tall
gorse
bush
opposite
tower
cottage
just
in
time
to
hear
the
sergeant
say
willnough
laundress
inkston
and
to
witness
the
parting
of
the
two
companions
there
was
very
little
to
go
upon
there
why
should
not
one
friend
give
another
an
address
but
the
examination
beaumaroy
should
surely
know
of
that
it
might
be
nothing
but
on
the
other
hand
it
might
have
a
meaning
but
the
men
had
gone
had
obviously
parted
for
the
night
beaumaroy
could
be
told
now
he
himself
could
go
back
to
his
visions
and
so
homeward
in
happiness
to
his
bed
having
reached
this
sensible
conclusion
he
was
about
to
turn
away
from
the
garden
gate
which
he
now
stood
facing
when
he
heard
the
house
door
softly
open
and
as
softly
shut
the
practice
of
his
profession
had
given
him
keen
eyes
in
the
dark
he
discovered
beaumaroy
tall
figure
stealing
very
cautiously
down
the
narrow
flagged
path
the
next
instant
the
light
of
another
torch
flashed
out
and
this
time
not
in
the
distance
but
full
in
his
own
face
by
god
you
naylor
beaumaroy
exclaimed
in
a
voice
which
was
low
but
full
of
surprise
i
i
well
it
rather
late
alec
naylor
was
suddenly
struck
with
the
element
of
humor
in
the
situation
he
had
been
playing
detective
apparently
he
was
now
the
suspected
give
me
time
and
i
explain
all
he
said
smiling
under
the
dazzling
rays
of
the
torch
beaumaroy
glanced
round
at
the
house
for
a
second
pursed
up
his
lips
into
one
of
the
odd
little
contortions
which
he
sometimes
allowed
himself
and
said
well
then
old
chap
come
in
and
have
a
drink
and
do
it
for
i
hanged
if
i
see
why
you
should
stand
staring
into
this
garden
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
your
opportunities
i
should
be
better
employed
on
christmas
evening
you
really
want
me
to
come
in
it
was
now
captain
alec
voice
which
expressed
surprise
why
the
devil
not
asked
beaumaroy
in
a
tone
of
frank
but
friendly
impatience
he
turned
and
led
the
way
into
tower
cottage
somehow
this
invitation
to
enter
was
the
last
thing
that
captain
alec
had
expected
chapter
viii
captain
alec
raises
his
voice
beaumaroy
led
the
way
into
the
parlor
captain
alec
following
well
i
thought
your
old
friend
did
care
to
see
strangers
he
said
continuing
the
conversation
he
was
tired
and
fretful
so
i
got
him
to
bed
and
gave
him
a
soothing
draught
one
that
our
friend
arkroyd
sent
him
he
went
off
like
a
lamb
poor
old
boy
if
we
do
talk
too
loud
we
disturb
him
i
can
tell
you
what
i
have
to
tell
in
a
few
minutes
do
hurry
beaumaroy
was
bringing
the
refreshment
he
had
offered
from
the
sideboard
i
feeling
lonely
so
i
he
smiled
yielded
to
the
impulse
to
ask
you
to
come
in
naylor
however
let
have
the
story
by
all
means
the
surprise
it
might
almost
have
been
taken
for
alarm
which
he
had
shown
at
the
first
sight
of
alec
seemed
to
have
given
place
to
a
gentle
and
amiable
weariness
which
persisted
through
the
recital
of
the
captain
experiences
how
his
errand
of
courtesy
or
gallantry
had
led
to
his
being
on
the
road
across
the
heath
so
late
at
night
and
of
what
he
had
seen
there
you
copped
them
properly
beaumaroy
remarked
at
the
end
with
a
lazy
smile
one
does
learn
a
trick
or
two
in
france
you
could
see
their
faces
i
suppose
no
too
dark
i
did
dare
show
a
light
though
i
had
one
besides
their
backs
were
towards
me
one
looked
tall
and
thin
the
other
short
and
stumpy
but
i
should
never
be
able
to
swear
to
either
and
they
went
off
in
different
directions
you
say
yes
the
tall
one
towards
sprotsfield
the
short
one
back
towards
inkston
oh
the
short
stumpy
one
it
was
who
turned
back
to
inkston
beaumaroy
had
seated
himself
on
a
low
stool
opposite
to
the
big
chair
where
alec
sat
and
was
smoking
his
pipe
his
hands
clasped
round
his
knees
it
does
seem
to
me
to
come
to
much
though
i
much
obliged
to
you
all
the
same
the
short
one
probably
a
local
the
other
a
stranger
and
the
local
was
probably
seeing
his
friend
part
of
the
way
home
and
incidentally
showing
him
one
of
the
sights
of
the
neighborhood
there
are
stories
about
this
old
den
you
know
ancient
traditions
said
to
be
haunted
and
what
not
funnily
enough
we
had
the
story
at
dinner
at
our
house
had
you
now
beaumaroy
looked
up
quickly
what
all
about
captain
duggle
and
the
devil
and
the
grave
and
all
that
who
told
you
the
story
old
penrose
do
you
know
him
lives
in
high
street
near
the
irechesters
i
think
i
know
him
by
sight
so
he
entertained
you
with
that
old
yarn
did
he
and
that
same
old
yarn
probably
accounts
for
the
nocturnal
examination
which
you
saw
going
on
it
was
a
little
excitement
for
you
to
reward
you
for
your
politeness
to
miss
walford
alec
flushed
but
answered
frankly
i
needed
no
reward
for
that
his
feelings
got
the
better
of
him
he
was
very
full
of
feelings
that
night
and
wanted
to
be
sympathized
with
beaumaroy
do
you
know
that
story
beaumaroy
shook
his
head
and
listened
to
it
captain
alec
ended
on
his
old
note
to
think
of
the
scoundrel
using
the
king
uniform
like
that
rotten
but
er
do
raise
your
voice
he
pointed
to
the
ceiling
smiling
and
went
on
without
further
comment
on
cynthia
i
suppose
you
intend
to
stick
to
the
army
naylor
yes
certainly
i
do
i
discharged
after
i
came
out
of
hospital
they
gave
me
sick
leave
and
constantly
renewed
it
and
when
the
armistice
came
they
gave
me
my
discharge
they
put
it
down
to
my
wound
of
course
but
well
i
gathered
the
impression
that
i
was
considered
no
great
loss
he
had
finished
his
pipe
and
was
now
smiling
reflectively
captain
alec
did
not
smile
indeed
he
looked
rather
pained
he
was
remembering
general
punnit
story
military
inefficiency
even
military
imperfection
was
for
him
no
smiling
matter
beaumaroy
did
not
appear
to
notice
his
disapproving
gravity
so
i
was
at
a
loose
end
i
had
sold
up
my
business
in
spain
i
was
there
six
or
seven
years
just
as
captain
captain
oh
cranster
yes
was
in
bogota
when
i
joined
up
and
had
no
particular
reason
for
going
back
there
and
incidentally
no
money
to
go
back
with
so
i
took
on
this
job
which
came
to
me
quite
accidentally
i
went
into
a
piccadilly
bar
one
evening
and
found
my
old
man
there
rather
excited
and
declaiming
a
good
deal
of
rot
seemed
to
have
the
war
a
bit
on
his
brain
they
started
in
to
guy
him
and
i
think
one
or
two
meant
to
hustle
him
and
perhaps
take
his
money
off
him
i
took
his
part
and
there
was
a
bit
of
a
shindy
in
the
end
i
saw
him
home
to
his
lodgings
he
had
a
room
in
london
for
the
night
and
to
cut
a
long
story
short
we
palled
up
and
he
asked
me
to
come
and
live
with
him
so
here
i
am
and
with
me
my
sancho
panza
the
worthy
hooper
perhaps
i
may
be
forgiven
for
impliedly
comparing
myself
to
don
quixote
since
that
gentleman
besides
his
other
characteristics
is
generally
agreed
to
have
been
mad
your
sancho
panza
no
beauty
remarked
the
captain
drily
and
no
saint
either
kicked
out
of
the
service
and
done
time
that
between
ourselves
then
why
the
devil
do
you
have
the
fellow
about
beggars
must
be
choosers
besides
i
a
for
failures
that
was
what
general
punnit
had
said
alec
naylor
grew
impatient
that
the
very
spirit
we
have
to
fight
against
he
exclaimed
rather
hotly
forgive
me
but
please
do
raise
your
voice
alec
lowered
his
voice
for
a
moment
anyhow
but
the
central
article
of
his
creed
was
assailed
and
he
grew
vehement
it
fatal
it
at
the
root
of
all
our
troubles
allow
for
failures
in
individuals
and
you
produce
failure
all
round
it
tenderness
to
defaulters
that
wrecks
discipline
i
would
have
strict
justice
but
no
mercy
not
a
shadow
of
it
but
you
said
that
day
at
your
place
that
the
war
had
made
you
yes
i
did
and
it
true
is
it
to
refuse
to
let
a
slacker
cost
good
men
their
lives
much
better
take
his
if
it
got
to
be
one
or
the
other
a
cogent
argument
but
my
dear
naylor
i
wish
you
would
raise
your
voice
damn
my
voice
said
alec
most
vexatiously
interrupted
just
as
he
had
got
into
his
stride
you
say
things
that
i
ca
and
wo
let
pass
and
i
really
would
have
asked
you
in
if
i
thought
you
raise
your
voice
alec
recollected
himself
my
dear
fellow
a
thousand
pardons
i
forgot
the
old
gentleman
exactly
but
i
afraid
the
mischief
done
listen
again
he
pointed
to
the
ceiling
but
his
eyes
set
on
captain
alec
with
a
queer
rueful
humorous
expression
i
was
an
ass
to
ask
you
in
but
i
no
good
at
it
that
the
fact
i
always
giving
the
show
away
he
grumbled
half
to
himself
but
not
inaudibly
alec
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
in
puzzle
but
the
next
instant
his
attention
was
diverted
another
voice
besides
his
was
raised
the
sound
of
it
came
through
the
ceiling
from
the
room
above
the
words
were
not
audible
the
volubility
of
the
utterance
in
itself
went
far
to
prevent
them
from
being
distinguishable
but
the
high
vibrant
metallic
tones
rang
through
the
house
it
was
a
rush
of
noise
sharp
grating
noise
without
a
meaning
the
effect
was
weird
very
uncomfortable
alec
naylor
knit
his
brows
and
once
gave
a
little
shiver
as
he
listened
beaumaroy
sat
quite
still
the
expression
in
his
eyes
unaltered
or
if
altered
at
all
it
grew
softer
as
though
with
pity
or
affection
good
god
beaumaroy
are
you
keeping
a
lunatic
in
this
house
he
might
raise
his
voice
as
loud
as
he
pleased
now
it
was
drowned
by
that
other
i
not
keeping
him
he
keeping
me
and
anyhow
his
medical
adviser
tells
me
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
my
old
friend
is
not
irechester
says
that
saffron
medical
attendant
is
dr
arkroyd
as
he
spoke
the
noise
from
above
suddenly
ceased
since
neither
of
the
men
in
the
parlor
spoke
there
ensued
a
minute
of
what
seemed
intense
silence
it
was
such
a
change
then
came
a
still
small
sound
a
creaking
of
wood
from
overhead
i
think
you
better
go
naylor
if
you
do
mind
after
a
performance
of
that
kind
he
generally
comes
and
tells
me
about
it
and
he
may
be
i
do
know
at
all
for
certain
annoyed
to
find
you
here
alec
naylor
got
up
from
the
big
chair
but
it
was
not
to
take
his
departure
i
want
to
see
him
beaumaroy
he
said
brusquely
and
rather
authoritatively
beaumaroy
raised
his
brows
i
wo
take
you
to
his
room
or
let
you
go
there
if
i
can
help
it
but
if
he
comes
down
well
you
can
stay
and
see
him
it
may
get
me
into
a
scrape
but
that
does
matter
much
my
point
of
view
is
my
dear
fellow
i
know
your
point
of
view
perfectly
it
is
that
you
are
personally
responsible
for
the
universe
apparently
just
because
you
wear
a
uniform
no
other
sound
had
come
from
above
or
from
the
stairs
but
the
door
now
opened
suddenly
and
saffron
stood
on
the
threshold
he
wore
slippers
a
pair
of
checked
trousers
and
his
bedroom
jacket
of
pale
blue
in
addition
the
gray
shawl
which
he
wore
on
his
walks
was
again
swathed
closely
round
him
only
his
right
arm
was
free
from
it
in
his
hand
was
a
silver
bedroom
candlestick
from
his
pale
face
and
under
his
snowy
hair
his
blue
eyes
gleamed
brightly
as
alec
first
caught
sight
of
him
he
was
smiling
happily
and
he
called
out
triumphantly
that
was
a
good
one
that
went
well
hector
then
he
saw
alec
tall
figure
by
the
fire
he
grew
grave
closed
the
door
carefully
and
advanced
to
the
table
on
which
he
set
down
the
candlestick
after
a
momentary
look
at
alec
he
turned
his
gaze
inquiringly
towards
beaumaroy
i
afraid
we
keeping
it
up
rather
late
sir
said
the
latter
in
a
tone
of
respectful
yet
easy
apology
but
i
took
an
airing
in
the
road
after
you
went
to
bed
and
there
i
found
my
friend
here
on
his
way
home
and
since
it
was
christmas
saffron
bowed
his
head
in
acquiescence
he
showed
no
sign
of
anger
present
your
friend
to
me
hector
he
requested
or
ordered
gravely
captain
naylor
sir
distinguished
service
order
duffshire
fusiliers
the
captain
was
in
uniform
and
during
his
talk
with
beaumaroy
had
not
thought
of
taking
off
his
cap
thus
he
came
to
the
salute
instinctively
the
old
man
bowed
with
reserved
dignity
in
spite
of
his
queer
he
bore
himself
well
the
tall
handsome
captain
did
not
seem
to
efface
or
outclass
him
captain
naylor
has
distinguished
himself
highly
in
the
war
sir
beaumaroy
continued
i
am
very
glad
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
any
officer
who
has
distinguished
himself
in
the
service
of
his
country
then
his
tone
became
easier
and
more
familiar
do
let
me
disturb
you
gentlemen
my
business
with
you
hector
will
wait
i
have
finished
my
work
and
can
rest
with
a
clear
conscience
could
we
persuade
you
to
stay
a
few
minutes
with
us
and
join
us
in
a
yes
by
all
means
hector
but
no
whisky
give
me
a
glass
of
my
own
wine
i
see
a
bottle
on
the
sideboard
he
came
round
the
table
and
sat
down
in
the
big
chair
pray
seat
yourself
captain
he
said
waving
his
hand
towards
the
stool
which
beaumaroy
had
lately
occupied
the
captain
obeyed
the
gesture
but
his
huge
frame
looked
awkward
on
the
low
seat
he
felt
aware
of
it
then
aware
of
the
cap
on
his
head
he
snatched
it
off
hastily
and
twiddled
it
between
his
fingers
saffron
high
up
in
the
great
chair
sitting
erect
seemed
now
actually
to
dominate
the
scene
beaumaroy
standing
by
with
an
arm
on
the
back
of
the
chair
holding
a
tall
glass
full
of
the
golden
wine
ready
to
saffron
command
the
old
man
reached
up
his
thin
right
hand
took
it
and
sipped
with
evident
pleasure
alec
naylor
was
embarrassed
he
sat
in
silence
but
beaumaroy
seemed
quite
at
his
ease
he
began
with
a
statement
which
was
in
its
literal
form
no
falsehood
but
that
was
about
all
that
could
be
said
for
it
on
the
score
of
veracity
before
you
came
in
sir
we
were
just
speaking
of
uniforms
do
you
remember
seeing
our
blue
air
force
uniform
when
we
were
in
town
last
week
i
remember
that
you
expressed
approval
of
it
in
any
case
the
topic
was
very
successful
saffron
embraced
it
with
eagerness
with
much
animation
he
discussed
the
merits
whether
practical
or
decorative
of
various
uniforms
khaki
horizon
blue
air
force
blue
and
a
dozen
others
worn
by
various
armies
corps
and
services
alec
was
something
of
an
enthusiast
in
this
line
too
he
soon
forgot
his
embarrassment
and
joined
in
the
conversation
freely
though
with
a
due
respect
to
the
obvious
thoroughness
of
information
watching
the
pair
with
an
amused
smile
beaumaroy
contented
himself
with
putting
in
here
and
there
what
may
be
called
a
conjunctive
observation
just
enough
to
give
the
topic
a
new
start
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
this
pleasant
conversation
for
such
all
three
seemed
to
find
it
saffron
finished
his
wine
handed
the
glass
to
beaumaroy
and
took
a
cordial
leave
of
alec
naylor
it
time
for
me
to
be
in
bed
but
do
hurry
away
captain
you
wo
disturb
me
i
a
good
sleeper
i
want
you
any
more
hector
beaumaroy
handed
him
his
candle
again
and
held
the
door
open
for
him
as
he
went
out
alec
naylor
clapped
his
cap
back
on
his
head
i
off
too
he
said
abruptly
well
you
insisted
on
seeing
him
and
you
seen
him
what
about
it
now
asked
beaumaroy
alec
eyed
him
with
a
puzzled
baffled
suspicion
you
switched
him
on
to
that
subject
on
purpose
and
by
means
of
something
uncommon
like
a
lie
a
little
artifice
i
knew
it
would
interest
you
and
it
quite
one
of
his
hobbies
i
do
know
much
about
his
past
life
but
i
think
he
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
military
tailoring
a
designer
at
the
war
office
perhaps
beaumaroy
gave
a
low
laugh
rather
mocking
and
malicious
still
that
does
prove
a
man
mad
does
it
perhaps
it
ought
to
but
in
general
opinion
it
does
any
more
than
reciting
poetry
in
bed
does
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
he
was
reciting
poetry
when
well
it
could
have
sounded
worse
if
he
had
been
could
it
now
he
was
openly
laughing
at
the
captain
angry
bewilderment
he
knew
that
alec
naylor
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
he
was
saying
or
suggesting
but
yet
alec
could
not
pass
his
guard
nor
wing
a
shaft
between
the
joints
of
his
harness
if
he
got
into
difficulties
through
heedlessness
at
least
he
made
a
good
shot
at
getting
out
of
them
again
by
his
dexterity
only
of
course
suspicion
remains
suspicion
even
though
it
be
for
the
moment
baffled
and
it
could
not
be
denied
that
suspicions
were
piling
up
captain
alec
irechester
even
on
one
little
point
doctor
mary
and
possibly
those
two
fellows
outside
one
of
them
short
and
stumpy
had
their
suspicions
too
though
these
might
be
directed
to
another
point
he
gave
one
of
his
little
shrugs
as
he
followed
the
silent
captain
to
the
garden
gate
thanks
again
and
i
hope
we
shall
meet
soon
he
said
cheerily
alec
gave
him
a
brief
and
a
particularly
formal
military
salute
chapter
ix
doctor
mary
ultimatum
even
captain
alec
was
not
superior
to
the
foibles
which
beset
humanity
if
it
had
been
his
conception
of
duty
which
impelled
him
to
take
a
high
line
with
beaumaroy
there
was
now
in
his
feelings
although
he
did
not
realize
the
fact
an
alloy
of
less
precious
metal
he
had
demanded
an
ordeal
a
test
that
he
should
see
saffron
and
judge
for
himself
the
test
had
been
accepted
he
had
been
worsted
in
it
his
suspicions
were
not
laid
to
rest
far
from
it
but
they
were
left
unjustified
and
unconfirmed
he
had
nothing
to
go
upon
nothing
to
show
he
had
been
baffled
and
moreover
bantered
and
almost
openly
ridiculed
in
fact
beaumaroy
had
been
too
many
for
him
the
subtle
rogue
this
conception
of
the
case
colored
his
looks
and
pointed
his
words
when
tower
cottage
and
its
occupants
were
referred
to
and
most
markedly
when
he
spoke
of
them
to
cynthia
walford
for
in
talking
to
her
he
naturally
allowed
himself
greater
freedom
than
he
did
with
others
talking
to
her
had
become
like
talking
to
himself
so
completely
did
she
give
him
back
what
he
bestowed
on
her
and
to
his
mind
its
own
voice
such
perfect
sympathy
induces
a
free
outpouring
of
inner
thoughts
and
reinforces
the
opinions
of
which
it
so
unreservedly
approves
cynthia
did
more
than
elicit
and
reinforce
captain
alec
opinion
she
also
disseminated
it
at
old
place
at
the
irechesters
at
doctor
mary
through
all
the
little
circle
in
which
she
was
now
a
constant
and
a
favorite
figure
in
the
light
of
her
experience
of
men
so
limited
and
so
sharply
contrasted
she
made
a
simple
classification
of
them
they
were
cransters
or
alecs
and
each
class
acted
after
its
kind
plainly
beaumaroy
was
not
an
alec
therefore
he
was
cranster
and
actions
were
to
be
expected
from
him
of
such
special
description
as
his
circumstances
and
temptations
might
dictate
she
poured
this
simple
philosophy
into
doctor
mary
ears
vouching
alec
authority
for
its
application
to
beaumaroy
the
theory
was
too
simple
for
mary
whose
profession
had
shown
her
at
all
events
something
of
the
complexity
of
human
nature
and
she
was
no
infallibilist
she
would
bow
unquestioningly
to
no
man
authority
not
even
to
alec
much
as
she
liked
and
admired
him
there
was
even
a
streak
of
contrariness
in
her
what
she
might
have
said
to
herself
she
was
prone
to
criticize
or
contradict
if
it
were
too
confidently
or
urgently
pressed
on
her
by
another
perhaps
too
cynthia
claim
to
be
the
captain
mouthpiece
stirred
up
in
her
a
latent
resentment
it
was
not
to
be
called
a
jealousy
it
was
rather
an
amused
irritation
at
both
the
divinity
and
his
worshiper
his
worshipers
can
sometimes
make
a
divinity
look
foolish
her
own
interview
with
beaumaroy
at
the
cottage
had
left
her
puzzled
distrustful
and
attracted
she
suspected
him
vaguely
of
wanting
to
use
her
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
in
spite
of
the
swift
plausibility
of
his
explanation
she
was
nearly
certain
that
he
had
lied
to
her
about
the
combination
yet
his
account
of
his
own
position
in
regard
to
saffron
had
sounded
remarkably
candid
and
the
more
so
because
he
made
no
pretensions
to
an
exalted
attitude
it
had
been
left
to
her
to
define
the
standard
of
sensitive
honor
his
had
been
rather
that
of
safety
or
at
the
best
that
of
what
the
world
would
think
or
even
of
what
the
hated
cousins
might
attempt
to
prove
but
there
again
she
was
distrustful
both
of
him
and
of
her
own
judgment
he
might
be
it
seemed
likely
one
of
those
men
who
conceal
the
good
as
well
as
the
bad
in
themselves
one
of
the
morally
shy
men
or
again
perhaps
one
of
the
morally
diffident
who
shrink
from
arrogating
to
themselves
high
standards
because
they
fear
for
their
own
virtue
if
it
be
put
to
the
test
and
cling
to
the
power
of
saying
later
on
well
i
told
you
not
to
expect
too
much
from
me
such
various
types
of
men
exist
and
they
do
not
fall
readily
into
either
of
cynthia
two
classes
they
are
neither
cransters
nor
alecs
certainly
not
in
thought
probably
not
in
conduct
he
had
said
at
old
place
the
first
time
that
she
met
him
that
the
war
had
destroyed
all
his
scruples
that
might
be
true
but
it
was
hardly
the
remark
of
a
man
naturally
unscrupulous
she
met
him
one
day
at
old
place
about
a
week
after
christmas
the
captain
was
not
there
he
was
at
her
own
house
with
cynthia
with
the
rest
of
the
family
beaumaroy
was
at
his
best
gaily
respectful
to
naylor
merry
with
gertie
exchanging
cut
and
thrust
with
old
naylor
easy
and
cordial
towards
herself
certainly
an
attractive
human
being
and
a
charming
companion
natural
one
talks
of
taking
people
as
one
finds
them
old
naylor
said
to
her
when
they
were
left
alone
together
for
a
few
minutes
by
the
fire
while
the
others
chatted
by
the
window
that
fellow
takes
himself
as
he
finds
himself
not
as
a
pattern
a
failure
or
a
problem
but
just
as
a
fact
a
psychological
fact
that
rather
shuts
out
effort
does
it
well
i
mean
strivings
naylor
smiled
yes
it
does
on
the
other
hand
it
gives
such
free
play
that
what
makes
him
interesting
makes
you
think
about
him
he
laughed
oh
i
dare
say
the
surroundings
help
too
we
all
rather
children
old
saffron
and
the
devil
and
captain
duggle
and
the
rest
of
it
the
brain
is
overworked
down
here
we
like
to
find
an
outlet
that
means
you
think
there
nothing
in
it
really
in
what
retorted
old
naylor
briskly
but
mary
was
equal
to
him
my
lips
are
sealed
professionally
she
smiled
but
has
your
son
said
anything
admirable
woman
yes
alec
has
said
a
few
things
and
the
young
lady
gives
it
us
too
for
my
part
i
think
beaumaroy
just
drifting
take
the
gifts
of
fortune
if
they
come
but
i
do
think
there
much
deliberate
design
about
it
ah
now
you
smiling
in
a
superior
way
doctor
mary
i
charge
you
with
secret
knowledge
or
are
you
puffed
up
by
having
superseded
irechester
i
was
never
so
distressed
and
well
embarrassed
at
anything
in
my
life
well
that
if
you
ask
me
does
look
a
bit
queer
sort
of
fits
in
with
alec
theory
mary
discretion
gave
way
a
little
or
with
beaumaroy
which
is
that
i
a
fool
i
think
and
that
irechester
is
his
eyes
twinkled
in
malice
talking
of
what
this
and
that
person
thinks
of
himself
and
of
others
irechester
thinks
himself
something
of
an
alienist
her
eyes
grew
suddenly
alert
he
never
talked
to
me
on
that
subject
perhaps
he
does
think
it
one
of
yours
perhaps
your
studies
lain
that
way
after
all
no
medical
man
can
study
everything
do
be
naughty
naylor
said
doctor
mary
he
tells
me
that
in
cases
where
the
condition
the
condition
i
think
he
called
it
is
in
doubt
he
fixes
his
attention
on
the
eyes
and
the
voice
he
could
give
me
any
very
clear
description
of
what
he
found
in
the
eyes
i
could
quite
make
out
anyhow
what
he
meant
unless
it
was
a
sort
of
meaninglessness
a
want
of
what
you
might
call
intellectual
focus
do
you
follow
me
yes
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
but
with
regard
to
the
voice
i
distinctly
remember
that
he
used
the
word
why
that
the
word
cynthia
used
i
dare
say
it
is
it
the
word
alec
used
in
describing
the
voice
in
which
old
saffron
recited
his
poem
or
whatever
it
was
in
bed
but
i
talked
to
saffron
his
voice
is
like
that
it
a
little
high
but
full
and
rather
melodious
oh
well
then
he
spread
out
his
hands
as
though
acknowledging
a
check
still
the
voice
described
as
metallic
seems
to
have
been
saffron
at
a
certain
moment
at
least
as
a
merely
medical
question
of
some
interest
i
wonder
if
such
a
symptom
or
sign
of
er
irritability
could
be
intermittent
coming
and
going
with
the
er
fits
irechester
did
say
anything
on
that
point
have
you
any
opinion
none
i
do
know
i
should
like
to
ask
dr
irechester
then
with
a
sudden
smile
she
amended
no
i
should
and
why
not
pray
professional
etiquette
no
pride
irechester
laughed
at
me
i
think
i
see
why
now
and
perhaps
why
beaumaroy
she
broke
off
abruptly
the
slightest
gesture
of
her
hand
warning
naylor
also
to
be
silent
having
said
to
his
friends
by
the
window
beaumaroy
was
sauntering
across
the
room
to
pay
the
like
courtesy
to
herself
and
naylor
mary
rose
to
her
feet
there
was
an
air
of
decision
about
her
and
she
addressed
beaumaroy
almost
before
he
was
within
speaking
distance
as
it
is
generally
reckoned
in
society
if
you
going
home
beaumaroy
shall
we
walk
together
it
time
i
was
off
too
beaumaroy
looked
a
little
surprised
but
undoubtedly
pleased
well
now
what
a
delightful
way
of
prolonging
a
delightful
visit
i
truly
grateful
dr
arkroyd
oh
you
need
be
said
mary
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
naylor
watched
them
with
amusement
he
catch
it
on
that
walk
he
was
thinking
she
going
to
let
him
have
it
i
wish
i
could
be
there
to
hear
he
spoke
to
them
openly
i
sorry
you
must
both
go
but
since
you
must
go
together
your
walk
will
be
much
pleasanter
mary
understood
him
well
enough
and
gave
him
a
flash
from
her
eyes
but
beaumaroy
face
betrayed
nothing
as
he
murmured
politely
to
me
at
all
events
mr
naylor
naylor
was
not
wrong
as
to
mary
mood
and
purpose
but
she
did
not
find
it
easy
to
begin
pretty
quick
at
a
retort
herself
she
could
often
foresee
the
retorts
open
to
her
interlocutor
beaumaroy
had
provided
himself
with
plenty
the
old
man
whim
the
access
to
the
old
man
so
willingly
allowed
not
only
to
her
but
to
captain
alec
his
own
candor
carried
to
the
verge
of
oh
he
would
be
full
of
retorts
supple
and
dexterous
ones
as
this
hostile
accusation
passed
through
her
mind
she
awoke
to
the
fact
that
she
was
at
the
same
moment
regarding
his
profile
he
too
was
silent
no
doubt
lying
in
wait
to
trip
up
her
opening
with
interest
even
with
some
approval
he
seemed
to
feel
her
glance
for
he
turned
towards
her
quickly
so
quickly
that
she
had
no
time
to
turn
her
eyes
away
doctor
mary
the
familiar
mode
of
address
habitually
used
at
the
house
which
they
had
just
left
seemed
to
slip
out
without
his
consciousness
of
it
you
got
something
against
me
i
know
you
have
i
sensitive
that
way
though
not
perhaps
in
another
now
out
with
it
you
silence
me
with
a
clever
answer
i
think
that
you
sometimes
make
the
mistake
of
supposing
that
to
be
silenced
is
the
same
thing
as
being
convinced
you
silenced
captain
naylor
oh
i
do
mean
you
prevented
him
from
talking
i
mean
you
confuted
him
you
put
him
in
the
wrong
but
you
certainly
did
convince
him
of
what
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
surprise
you
know
that
let
us
suppose
his
idea
was
all
nonsense
yet
your
immediate
object
was
to
put
it
out
of
his
head
she
suddenly
added
i
think
your
last
question
was
a
diplomatic
blunder
beaumaroy
you
must
have
known
what
i
meant
what
was
the
good
of
pretending
not
to
beaumaroy
stopped
still
in
the
road
for
a
moment
looking
at
her
with
a
rueful
amusement
you
not
so
easily
silenced
after
all
he
said
starting
to
walk
on
again
you
encourage
me
to
tell
the
truth
mary
was
not
only
encouraged
she
was
pleased
by
the
hit
she
had
scored
and
flattered
by
his
acknowledgment
of
it
well
then
i
put
another
point
you
answer
if
you
do
like
i
shall
answer
if
i
can
depend
on
it
he
laughed
and
mary
for
a
brief
instant
joined
in
his
laugh
his
sudden
lapses
into
candor
seemed
somehow
to
put
the
serious
hostile
questioner
ridiculously
in
the
wrong
could
a
man
like
that
really
have
anything
to
conceal
but
she
held
to
her
purpose
you
a
friendly
sort
of
man
you
offer
and
accept
attentions
and
kindnesses
you
not
or
haughty
or
sulky
you
make
friends
easily
especially
perhaps
with
women
they
like
you
and
like
to
be
pleasant
and
kind
to
you
there
are
men
patients
i
mean
very
hard
to
deal
with
men
who
resent
being
ill
resent
having
to
have
things
done
to
them
and
for
them
who
especially
resent
the
services
of
women
even
of
nurses
i
mean
in
quite
indifferent
things
not
merely
in
things
where
a
man
may
naturally
shrink
from
their
help
well
you
do
seem
that
sort
of
man
in
the
least
she
looked
at
him
as
she
ended
this
appreciation
of
him
as
though
she
expected
an
answer
or
a
comment
beaumaroy
made
neither
he
walked
on
not
even
looking
at
her
and
you
ca
have
been
troubled
long
with
that
wound
it
evidently
healed
up
quickly
and
sweetly
beaumaroy
looked
for
an
instant
at
his
maimed
hand
with
a
critical
air
but
he
was
still
silent
so
that
i
wonder
you
did
do
as
most
patients
do
let
the
nurse
or
if
you
were
still
disabled
after
you
came
out
a
friend
or
somebody
cut
up
your
food
for
you
without
providing
yourself
with
that
implement
he
turned
his
head
quickly
towards
her
and
if
you
ask
me
what
implement
i
mean
i
shall
answer
the
one
you
tried
to
snatch
from
the
sideboard
at
tower
cottage
before
i
could
see
it
it
was
a
direct
challenge
she
charged
him
with
a
lie
beaumaroy
face
assumed
a
really
troubled
expression
a
thing
rare
for
it
to
do
yet
it
was
not
an
ashamed
or
abashed
expression
it
just
seemed
to
recognize
that
a
troublesome
difficulty
had
arisen
he
set
a
slower
pace
and
prodded
the
road
with
his
stick
mary
pushed
her
advantage
your
your
improvization
did
satisfy
me
at
the
time
and
the
more
i
thought
over
it
the
less
have
i
found
it
convincing
he
stopped
again
turning
round
to
her
he
slapped
his
left
hand
against
the
side
of
his
leg
well
there
it
is
doctor
mary
you
must
make
what
you
can
of
it
it
was
complete
surrender
as
to
the
combination
he
was
beaten
on
that
point
at
least
and
owned
it
his
lie
was
found
out
it
dashed
difficult
always
to
remember
that
you
a
doctor
he
broke
out
the
next
minute
mary
could
not
help
laughing
but
her
eyes
were
still
keen
and
challenging
as
she
said
perhaps
you
better
change
your
doctor
again
beaumaroy
you
have
found
one
stupid
enough
again
beaumaroy
had
no
defense
his
nonplussed
air
confessed
that
maneuver
too
mary
dropped
her
rallying
tone
and
went
on
gravely
unless
i
treated
with
confidence
and
sincerity
i
ca
continue
to
attend
mr
saffron
that
your
ultimatum
is
it
doctor
mary
she
nodded
sharply
and
decisively
beaumaroy
meditated
for
a
few
seconds
then
he
shook
his
head
regretfully
it
no
use
i
trust
you
he
said
mary
laughed
again
this
time
in
amazed
resentment
of
his
impudence
you
ca
trust
me
i
think
it
the
other
way
round
it
seems
to
me
that
the
boot
on
the
other
leg
not
as
i
see
it
then
he
smiled
slowly
as
it
were
tentatively
or
would
you
i
wonder
if
you
could
possibly
well
stand
in
with
me
are
you
offering
me
a
a
partnership
she
asked
indignantly
he
raised
his
hand
in
a
seeming
protest
and
spoke
now
hastily
and
in
some
confusion
not
as
you
understand
it
i
mean
as
you
probably
understand
it
from
what
i
said
to
you
that
night
at
the
cottage
there
are
features
in
the
well
there
are
things
that
i
admit
have
have
passed
through
my
mind
without
being
what
you
call
settled
oh
yes
without
being
in
the
least
settled
well
for
the
sake
of
your
help
and
er
those
those
features
could
be
dropped
and
then
perhaps
if
only
your
your
rules
and
etiquette
mary
scornfully
cut
short
his
embarrassed
pleadings
there
a
good
deal
more
than
rules
and
etiquette
involved
it
seems
to
me
that
it
a
matter
of
common
honesty
rather
than
of
rules
and
etiquette
yes
but
you
do
understand
she
cut
him
short
again
beaumaroy
after
this
after
your
suggestion
and
all
the
rest
of
it
there
must
be
an
end
of
all
relations
between
us
professionally
and
so
far
as
possible
socially
too
please
i
do
want
to
be
but
i
feel
bound
to
say
that
you
have
misunderstood
my
character
her
voice
quivered
at
the
end
and
almost
broke
she
was
full
of
a
grieved
indignation
they
had
come
opposite
the
cottage
now
beaumaroy
stopped
and
stood
facing
her
though
dusk
had
fallen
it
was
a
clear
evening
she
could
see
his
face
plainly
obviously
he
was
in
deep
distress
i
would
have
offended
you
for
the
world
i
i
like
you
far
too
much
doctor
mary
you
imputed
your
own
standards
to
me
that
all
there
is
about
it
i
suppose
she
said
in
a
scornful
sadness
he
looked
very
miserable
compassion
and
the
old
odd
attraction
which
he
had
for
her
stirred
in
her
mind
her
voice
grew
soft
and
she
held
out
her
hand
i
sorry
too
very
sorry
that
it
should
have
to
be
between
us
beaumaroy
did
not
take
her
proffered
hand
or
even
seem
to
notice
it
he
stood
quite
still
i
damned
if
i
know
what
i
to
do
now
close
on
the
heels
of
his
despairing
confession
of
helplessness
for
such
it
undoubtedly
seemed
to
me
came
the
noise
of
an
opening
door
a
light
from
the
inside
of
the
cottage
a
patter
of
feet
on
the
flagged
path
that
led
to
the
garden
gate
the
next
moment
mary
saw
the
figure
of
saffron
in
his
old
gray
shawl
standing
at
the
gate
he
was
waving
his
right
arm
in
an
excited
way
and
his
hand
held
a
large
sheet
of
paper
hector
hector
my
dear
dear
boy
the
news
has
come
at
last
you
can
be
off
tomorrow
beaumaroy
started
violently
glanced
at
his
old
friend
strange
figure
glanced
once
too
at
mary
the
expression
of
utter
despair
which
his
face
had
worn
seemed
modified
into
one
of
humorous
bewilderment
yes
yes
you
can
start
tomorrow
for
morocco
my
dear
boy
cried
old
saffron
beaumaroy
lifted
his
hat
to
her
cried
i
coming
sir
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
quickly
up
to
saffron
she
watched
him
open
the
gate
and
take
the
old
gentleman
by
the
arm
she
heard
the
murmur
of
his
voice
speaking
soft
accents
as
the
pair
walked
up
the
path
together
they
passed
into
the
house
and
the
door
was
shut
mary
stood
where
she
was
for
a
moment
then
moved
slowly
hesitatingly
yet
as
though
under
a
lure
which
she
could
not
resist
just
outside
the
gate
lay
something
that
gleamed
white
through
the
darkness
it
was
the
sheet
of
paper
saffron
had
dropped
it
in
his
excitement
and
beaumaroy
had
not
noticed
mary
stole
forward
and
picked
it
up
stealthily
she
was
incapable
of
resisting
her
curiosity
or
even
of
stopping
to
think
about
her
action
she
held
it
up
to
what
light
there
was
and
strained
her
eyes
to
examine
it
so
far
as
she
could
see
it
was
covered
with
dots
dashes
lines
queerly
drawn
geometrical
figures
a
mass
of
meaningless
hieroglyphics
she
dropped
it
again
where
she
had
found
it
and
made
off
home
with
guilty
swiftness
yes
there
had
been
this
time
a
distinctly
metallic
ring
in
old
saffron
voice
chapter
x
the
magical
word
morocco
when
mary
arrived
home
she
found
cynthia
and
captain
alec
still
in
possession
of
the
their
manner
accused
her
legitimate
entry
into
the
room
of
being
an
outrageous
intrusion
she
took
no
heed
of
that
and
indeed
little
heed
of
them
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
ashamed
to
confess
but
it
was
the
truth
she
felt
rather
tired
of
them
that
evening
their
affair
deserved
every
laudatory
epithet
except
that
of
interesting
so
she
declared
peevishly
within
herself
as
she
tried
to
join
in
conversation
with
them
it
was
no
use
they
talked
on
and
in
justice
to
them
it
may
be
urged
that
they
were
fully
as
bored
with
mary
as
she
was
with
them
so
naturally
their
talents
did
not
shine
their
brightest
but
they
had
plenty
to
say
to
one
another
and
dutifully
threw
in
a
question
or
a
reference
to
mary
every
now
and
then
sitting
apart
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
low
room
it
ran
through
the
whole
depth
of
her
dwelling
she
barely
heeded
and
barely
answered
they
smiled
at
one
another
and
were
glad
she
was
very
tired
her
feelings
were
wounded
her
nerves
on
edge
she
could
not
even
attempt
any
cool
train
of
reasoning
the
outcome
of
her
talk
with
beaumaroy
filled
her
mind
rather
than
the
matter
of
it
and
more
even
than
that
the
figure
of
the
man
seemed
to
be
with
her
almost
to
stand
before
her
with
his
queer
alternations
of
despair
and
mirth
of
defiance
and
pleading
of
derision
and
alarm
one
moment
she
was
intensely
irritated
with
him
in
the
next
she
half
forgave
the
plaintive
image
which
the
fancy
of
her
mind
conjured
up
before
her
eyes
her
eyes
closed
she
was
so
very
tired
the
fight
had
taken
it
out
of
her
to
have
to
do
things
like
that
was
an
odious
necessity
which
had
never
befallen
her
before
that
man
had
done
well
captain
alec
was
quite
right
about
him
yet
still
the
shadowy
image
though
thus
reproached
did
not
depart
it
was
smiling
at
her
now
with
its
old
mockery
the
kindly
mockery
which
his
face
wore
before
they
quarrelled
and
before
its
light
was
quenched
in
that
forlorn
bewilderment
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
image
began
to
say
some
words
to
her
disconnected
words
not
making
a
sentence
but
yet
having
for
the
image
a
pregnant
meaning
and
seeming
to
her
though
vaguely
and
very
dimly
to
be
the
key
to
what
she
had
to
understand
she
was
stupid
not
to
understand
words
so
full
of
meaning
just
as
stupid
as
beaumaroy
had
thought
then
doctor
mary
fell
asleep
sound
asleep
she
had
been
very
near
it
for
the
last
ten
minutes
captain
alec
and
cynthia
were
in
two
chairs
close
side
by
side
in
front
of
the
fire
once
cynthia
glanced
over
her
shoulder
the
captain
had
glanced
over
his
in
the
same
direction
already
one
of
his
hands
held
one
of
cynthia
it
was
well
to
be
sure
that
mary
was
asleep
really
asleep
she
had
gone
to
sleep
on
the
name
of
beaumaroy
on
it
she
awoke
it
came
from
captain
alec
lips
he
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
with
his
arm
round
cynthia
waist
and
his
other
hand
raising
one
of
hers
to
his
lips
he
looked
admirably
handsome
strong
protecting
devoted
and
cynthia
in
her
fragile
appealing
prettiness
was
a
delicious
foil
a
perfect
complement
to
the
picture
but
now
under
stress
of
emotion
small
blame
to
a
man
who
was
making
a
vow
of
eternal
fidelity
under
stress
of
emotion
as
on
a
previous
occasion
under
that
of
indignation
the
captain
had
raised
his
voice
yes
against
all
the
scoundrels
in
the
world
whether
they
called
cranster
or
beaumaroy
he
said
mary
eyes
opened
she
sat
up
cranster
and
beaumaroy
they
were
the
words
which
her
ears
had
caught
what
in
the
world
has
beaumaroy
to
do
with
but
she
broke
off
as
she
saw
the
couple
by
the
fire
but
what
are
you
two
doing
cynthia
broke
away
from
her
lover
and
ran
to
her
friend
with
joyous
avowals
i
must
have
been
sound
asleep
cried
mary
kissing
her
alec
had
followed
across
the
room
and
now
stood
close
by
her
she
looked
up
at
him
oh
i
see
she
to
be
safe
now
from
such
people
on
this
particular
occasion
mary
look
at
the
captain
was
not
admiring
it
was
a
little
scornful
that
the
idea
agreed
the
happy
alec
another
idea
is
that
i
trot
you
both
over
in
the
car
to
old
place
to
break
the
news
and
have
dinner
splendid
cried
cynthia
do
come
mary
mary
shook
her
head
no
you
go
you
two
she
said
i
tired
and
i
want
to
think
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
wipe
away
the
mists
of
sleep
her
face
suddenly
grew
animated
and
exultant
no
i
do
want
to
think
i
know
she
exclaimed
emphatically
mary
dear
are
you
still
asleep
are
you
talking
in
your
sleep
the
keyword
it
came
to
me
somehow
in
my
sleep
the
keyword
morocco
what
the
deuce
has
morocco
captain
alec
began
with
justifiable
impatience
ah
you
never
heard
that
and
dear
captain
alec
you
would
have
understood
it
if
you
had
you
thought
he
was
reciting
poems
what
he
was
really
doing
look
here
doctor
mary
i
just
been
accepted
by
cynthia
and
going
to
take
her
to
my
mother
and
father
can
you
get
your
mind
on
to
that
he
looked
at
her
curiously
not
at
all
understanding
her
excitement
perhaps
resenting
the
obvious
fact
that
his
happiness
was
not
foremost
in
her
friend
mind
with
a
great
effort
mary
brought
herself
down
to
the
earth
to
the
earth
of
romantic
love
from
the
heaven
of
professional
triumph
true
the
latter
was
hers
the
former
somebody
else
i
do
beg
your
pardon
i
do
indeed
and
do
let
me
kiss
you
again
cynthia
darling
and
you
dear
captain
alec
just
once
and
then
you
shall
go
off
to
dinner
she
laughed
excitedly
yes
i
going
to
push
you
out
let
go
alec
said
cynthia
not
unkindly
yet
just
a
little
pettishly
the
great
moment
of
her
life
surely
as
great
a
moment
as
there
had
ever
been
in
anybody
life
had
hardly
earned
adequate
recognition
from
mary
as
usual
her
feelings
and
alec
were
at
one
before
they
passed
to
other
and
more
important
matters
when
they
drove
off
in
the
car
she
said
to
alec
it
seems
to
me
that
mary
strangely
interested
in
that
beaumaroy
had
she
been
dreaming
of
him
alec
looks
like
it
and
why
the
devil
morocco
his
intellect
baffled
captain
alec
took
refuge
in
his
affections
left
alone
and
so
thankful
for
it
doctor
mary
did
not
attempt
to
sit
still
she
walked
up
and
down
she
roved
here
and
there
smoking
any
quantity
of
cigarettes
she
would
certainly
have
forbidden
such
excess
to
a
patient
the
keyword
its
significance
had
seemed
to
come
to
her
in
her
sleep
something
in
that
subconsciousness
theory
the
word
explained
linked
up
gave
significance
that
magical
word
morocco
yes
they
fell
into
place
now
the
things
that
had
been
so
puzzling
and
that
looked
now
so
obviously
suggestive
even
one
thing
which
she
had
thought
nothing
about
which
had
not
struck
her
as
having
any
significance
now
took
on
its
meaning
the
gray
shawl
which
the
old
gentleman
so
constantly
wore
swathed
round
his
body
enveloping
the
whole
of
it
except
his
right
arm
did
he
wear
the
shawl
while
he
took
his
meals
doctor
mary
could
not
tell
as
to
that
perhaps
he
did
not
at
his
meals
only
beaumaroy
and
perhaps
their
servant
would
be
present
but
he
seemed
to
wear
it
whenever
he
went
abroad
whenever
he
was
exposed
to
the
scrutiny
of
strangers
that
indicated
secretiveness
perhaps
fear
the
apprehension
of
something
the
caution
bred
by
that
might
give
way
under
the
influence
of
great
cerebral
excitement
unquestionably
saffron
had
been
very
excited
when
he
waved
the
sheet
of
hieroglyphics
and
shouted
to
beaumaroy
about
morocco
but
whether
he
wore
the
shawl
or
not
in
the
safe
privacy
of
tower
cottage
whatever
might
be
the
truth
about
that
perhaps
he
varied
his
practice
according
to
his
condition
on
one
thing
doctor
mary
would
stake
her
life
he
used
the
combination
for
it
was
over
that
implement
that
beaumaroy
had
tripped
up
it
ought
to
have
been
hidden
before
she
was
admitted
to
the
cottage
somebody
had
been
careless
somebody
had
blundered
whether
beaumaroy
himself
or
his
servant
was
immaterial
beaumaroy
had
lied
readily
and
ingeniously
but
not
quite
readily
enough
the
dart
of
his
hand
had
betrayed
him
that
and
a
look
in
his
eyes
a
mirth
which
had
seemed
to
mock
both
her
and
himself
and
had
made
his
ingenious
lie
even
at
the
moment
unconvincing
yes
whether
saffron
wore
the
shawl
or
not
he
certainly
used
the
combination
table
implement
and
the
poems
the
poems
which
saffron
recited
to
himself
in
bed
and
which
he
had
said
in
captain
alec
hearing
were
good
and
went
well
it
was
beaumaroy
of
course
who
had
called
them
poems
the
captain
had
merely
repeated
the
description
but
with
her
newly
found
insight
doctor
mary
knew
better
what
saffron
declaimed
in
that
vibrating
metallic
voice
were
not
poems
but
speeches
and
morocco
itself
to
anybody
who
remembered
history
for
a
few
years
back
even
with
the
general
memory
of
the
man
in
the
street
to
anybody
who
had
read
the
controversies
about
the
war
morocco
brought
not
puzzle
but
enlightenment
for
had
not
morocco
been
really
the
starting
point
of
the
years
of
crisis
those
years
intermittent
in
excitement
but
constant
in
anxiety
beaumaroy
was
to
start
tomorrow
for
morocco
on
the
strength
of
the
hieroglyphics
perhaps
he
was
to
go
on
from
morocco
to
libya
perhaps
he
was
to
raise
the
senussi
mary
had
followed
the
history
of
the
war
to
make
his
appearance
at
cairo
jerusalem
bagdad
he
was
to
be
a
forerunner
was
beaumaroy
saffron
his
august
master
would
follow
in
due
course
with
a
sardonic
smile
she
wondered
how
the
ingenious
man
would
get
out
of
starting
for
morocco
perhaps
he
would
not
succeed
in
obtaining
a
passport
or
that
excuse
failing
in
eluding
the
vigilance
of
the
british
authorities
or
some
more
hieroglyphics
might
come
carrying
another
message
postponing
his
start
saying
that
the
propitious
moment
had
not
yet
arrived
after
all
there
were
several
devices
open
to
ingenuity
many
ways
in
which
beaumaroy
might
protract
a
situation
not
so
bad
for
him
even
as
it
stood
and
quite
rich
in
possibilities
her
acid
smile
was
turned
against
herself
when
she
remembered
that
she
had
been
fool
enough
to
talk
to
beaumaroy
about
sensitive
honor
well
never
mind
beaumaroy
the
case
as
to
saffron
stood
pretty
plain
it
was
queer
and
pitiful
but
by
no
means
unprecedented
she
might
be
not
much
of
an
alienist
as
irechester
had
been
kind
enough
to
suggest
to
naylor
but
she
had
seen
such
cases
herself
even
stranger
ones
where
even
higher
powers
suffered
impersonation
with
effects
still
more
tragically
absurd
to
onlookers
and
she
remembered
reading
somewhere
was
it
in
maudslay
that
in
the
days
of
napoleon
when
princes
and
kings
were
as
ninepins
to
be
set
up
and
knocked
down
at
the
tyrant
pleasure
the
asylums
of
france
were
full
of
such
great
folk
potentates
there
galore
if
she
had
saffron
record
before
her
she
would
expect
to
read
of
a
vain
ostentatious
man
ambitious
in
his
own
small
way
the
little
plant
of
these
qualities
would
given
a
morbid
physical
condition
develop
into
the
fantastic
growth
of
delusion
which
she
had
now
diagnosed
in
the
case
of
saffron
diagnosed
with
the
assistance
of
some
lucky
accidents
but
what
was
her
duty
now
the
duty
of
mary
arkroyd
a
duly
qualified
accredited
responsible
medical
practitioner
with
a
slight
shock
to
her
she
was
obliged
to
confess
that
she
had
only
the
haziest
idea
had
not
people
who
kept
a
lunatic
to
be
licensed
or
something
or
did
that
apply
only
to
lunatics
in
the
plural
and
did
beaumaroy
keep
saffron
within
the
meaning
of
whatever
the
law
might
be
but
at
any
rate
she
must
do
something
the
state
of
things
at
tower
cottage
could
not
go
on
as
it
was
the
law
of
the
land
whatever
it
was
must
be
observed
beaumaroy
must
be
foiled
and
poor
old
saffron
taken
proper
care
of
the
course
of
her
meditations
was
hardly
interrupted
by
the
episode
of
her
light
evening
meal
she
was
back
in
her
by
half
past
eight
her
mind
engrossed
with
the
matter
still
it
was
a
little
after
nine
when
there
was
a
ring
at
the
hall
door
not
the
lovers
back
so
early
she
heard
a
man
voice
in
the
hall
the
next
moment
beaumaroy
was
shown
in
and
the
door
shut
behind
him
he
stood
still
by
it
making
no
motion
to
advance
towards
her
he
was
breathing
quickly
and
she
noticed
beads
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
she
had
sprung
to
her
feet
at
the
sight
of
him
and
faced
him
with
indignation
you
have
no
right
to
come
here
beaumaroy
after
what
passed
between
us
this
afternoon
besides
being
as
you
saw
yourself
very
excited
my
poor
old
friend
is
at
all
well
tonight
i
very
sorry
but
i
no
longer
saffron
medical
attendant
if
i
declined
to
be
this
afternoon
i
decline
ten
times
more
tonight
for
all
i
know
he
very
ill
indeed
dr
arkroyd
beaumaroy
manner
was
very
quiet
restrained
and
formal
i
have
come
to
a
clear
conclusion
about
saffron
case
since
i
left
you
i
thought
you
might
i
suppose
put
you
on
the
scent
and
i
suppose
too
that
you
looked
at
that
wretched
bit
of
paper
i
i
thought
of
it
here
mary
was
slightly
embarrassed
you
have
been
more
than
human
if
you
had
i
was
out
again
after
it
in
five
minutes
as
soon
as
i
missed
it
you
gone
but
i
concluded
you
seen
it
he
scribbles
dozens
like
that
you
seem
to
admit
my
conclusion
about
his
mental
condition
she
observed
stiffly
i
always
admit
when
i
cease
to
be
able
to
deny
but
do
let
stand
here
talking
really
for
all
i
know
he
may
be
dying
his
heart
seems
to
me
very
bad
go
and
ask
dr
irechester
he
dreads
irechester
i
believe
the
sight
of
irechester
might
finish
him
you
must
come
i
ca
for
the
reasons
i
told
you
why
my
misdeeds
or
your
rules
and
regulations
my
god
how
i
hate
rules
and
regulations
which
of
them
is
it
that
is
perhaps
to
cost
the
old
man
his
life
mary
could
not
resist
the
appeal
that
could
hardly
be
her
duty
and
certainly
was
not
her
inclination
her
grievance
was
not
against
poor
old
saffron
with
his
pitiful
delusion
of
greatness
of
a
greatness
too
which
now
had
suffered
an
eclipse
almost
as
tragical
as
that
which
had
befallen
his
own
reason
what
an
irony
in
his
mad
aping
of
it
now
i
will
come
beaumaroy
on
condition
that
you
give
me
candidly
and
truthfully
all
the
information
which
as
saffron
medical
attendant
i
am
entitled
to
ask
i
tell
you
all
i
know
about
him
and
about
myself
too
your
affairs
and
er
position
matter
to
me
only
so
far
as
they
bear
on
mr
saffron
so
be
it
only
come
quickly
and
bring
some
of
your
things
that
may
help
a
man
with
a
bad
heart
mary
left
him
went
to
her
surgery
and
was
quickly
back
with
her
bag
i
get
out
the
car
it
take
a
little
longer
i
know
but
do
you
mind
if
we
walk
cars
always
alarm
him
he
thinks
that
they
come
to
take
him
away
every
car
that
passes
vexes
him
he
looks
to
see
if
it
will
stop
and
when
yours
does
he
ended
with
a
shrug
for
the
first
time
mary
feelings
took
on
a
keen
edge
of
pity
poor
old
gentleman
fancy
his
living
like
that
and
cars
military
cars
too
had
been
so
common
on
the
road
across
the
heath
i
understand
let
us
go
at
once
you
walked
yourself
i
suppose
ran
said
beaumaroy
and
with
the
first
sign
of
a
smile
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
with
the
back
of
his
hand
i
ready
beaumaroy
said
doctor
mary
they
walked
along
together
in
silence
for
fully
half
the
way
then
beaumaroy
spoke
he
was
extremely
excited
at
his
worst
when
he
and
i
went
into
the
cottage
i
had
to
humor
him
in
every
way
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
that
was
followed
by
great
fatigue
a
sort
of
collapse
i
persuaded
him
to
go
to
bed
i
hope
we
shall
find
him
there
but
i
know
he
would
let
me
go
only
on
condition
that
i
left
the
door
of
the
tower
unlocked
so
that
he
could
go
in
there
if
he
wanted
to
if
he
has
i
afraid
that
you
may
see
something
well
something
rather
bizarre
dr
arkroyd
that
all
in
the
course
of
my
profession
silence
fell
on
them
again
till
the
outline
of
cottage
and
tower
came
into
view
through
the
darkness
beaumaroy
spoke
only
once
again
before
they
reached
the
garden
gate
if
he
should
happen
to
be
calmer
now
i
hope
you
will
not
consider
it
necessary
to
tell
him
that
you
suspect
anything
unusual
he
is
secretive
he
lives
in
terror
of
what
of
being
shut
up
may
i
lead
the
way
in
dr
arkroyd
they
entered
the
cottage
and
beaumaroy
shut
the
door
a
lamp
was
burning
dimly
in
the
passage
he
turned
it
up
would
you
kindly
wait
here
one
minute
receiving
her
nod
of
acquiescence
he
stepped
softly
up
the
stairs
and
she
heard
him
open
a
door
above
she
knew
it
was
that
of
saffron
bedroom
where
she
had
visited
the
old
man
she
waited
now
with
a
sudden
sense
of
suspense
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
cottage
beaumaroy
was
down
again
in
a
minute
it
is
as
i
feared
he
said
quietly
he
has
got
up
again
and
gone
into
the
tower
shall
i
try
and
get
him
out
or
will
you
i
will
go
in
with
you
of
course
mr
beaumaroy
his
old
mirthful
yet
rueful
smile
came
on
his
lips
just
for
a
moment
then
he
was
grave
and
formal
again
this
way
then
if
you
please
arkroyd
he
said
deferentially
chapter
xi
the
car
behind
the
trees
percy
bennett
that
gentlemanly
stranger
was
an
enemy
to
delay
both
constitutionally
and
owing
to
experience
averse
from
dallying
with
fortune
to
him
a
bird
in
his
hand
was
worth
a
whole
aviary
on
his
neighbor
unrifled
premises
he
thought
that
beaumaroy
might
levant
with
the
treasure
at
any
moment
that
unwelcome
though
not
unfamiliar
tap
on
the
shoulder
with
the
words
gratifying
under
quite
other
circumstances
and
from
quite
different
lips
i
want
you
might
incapacitate
him
from
prosecuting
his
enterprise
he
expressed
this
idea
in
more
homely
idiom
less
latinized
was
his
language
metaphorical
indeed
yet
terse
finally
he
had
that
healthy
distrust
of
his
accomplices
which
is
essential
to
success
in
a
career
of
crime
he
thought
that
sergeant
hooper
might
not
deliver
the
goods
sergeant
hooper
demurred
he
deprecated
inconsiderate
haste
let
the
opportunity
be
chosen
he
had
served
under
beaumaroy
in
france
and
whatever
faults
punnit
might
find
with
that
officer
preferred
that
he
should
be
off
the
premises
at
the
moment
when
bennett
and
he
himself
made
unauthorized
entry
thereon
he
a
hot
in
a
scrap
said
the
sergeant
sitting
in
a
public
house
at
sprotsfield
on
boxing
day
evening
bennett
and
sundry
other
excursionists
from
london
being
present
my
chauffeur
will
settle
him
said
bennett
it
may
seem
odd
that
bennett
should
have
a
chauffeur
but
he
had
or
proposed
to
have
hac
or
for
this
particular
job
in
fact
without
a
car
that
stuff
at
tower
cottage
somewhere
at
tower
cottage
would
be
difficult
to
shift
the
sergeant
demurred
still
by
no
means
for
the
sake
of
saving
beaumaroy
skin
but
still
purely
for
the
reason
already
given
yet
he
admitted
that
he
could
not
name
any
date
on
which
he
could
guarantee
beaumaroy
absence
from
tower
cottage
he
never
leaves
the
old
blighter
alone
later
than
eleven
or
so
and
rarely
as
late
as
that
then
any
night
about
the
same
said
gentleman
bennett
and
now
for
the
scheme
dear
sergeant
hooper
despaired
of
the
doors
the
might
possibly
be
negotiated
though
at
the
probable
cost
of
arousing
the
notice
of
beaumaroy
and
of
the
old
blighter
himself
but
the
door
from
the
parlor
into
the
tower
offered
insuperable
difficulties
it
was
always
locked
the
lock
was
intricate
he
had
never
so
much
as
seen
the
key
at
close
quarters
and
even
had
opportunity
offered
was
quite
unpractised
in
the
art
of
taking
impressions
of
locks
a
thing
not
done
with
accuracy
quite
so
easily
as
seems
sometimes
to
be
assumed
for
my
own
part
said
bennett
with
a
nod
i
always
inclined
to
the
window
we
can
negotiate
that
without
any
noise
to
speak
of
and
it
ought
to
take
us
more
than
a
few
minutes
just
deal
boards
i
expect
perhaps
the
old
gentleman
and
your
pal
beaumaroy
the
sergeant
spat
will
sleep
right
through
it
if
they
ai
in
the
tower
itself
suggested
the
sergeant
gloomily
wherever
they
may
be
said
gentleman
bennett
with
a
touch
of
irritability
he
was
himself
a
sanguine
man
and
disliked
a
mind
fertile
in
objections
i
suppose
the
stuff
in
the
tower
is
it
it
goes
in
there
and
i
never
seen
it
come
out
mr
bennett
here
at
least
a
tone
of
confidence
rang
in
the
sergeant
voice
but
where
in
the
tower
sergeant
should
i
know
i
never
been
in
the
blooming
place
it
really
rather
a
queer
business
observed
bennett
allowing
himself
for
a
moment
an
outside
and
critical
consideration
of
the
matter
damned
said
the
sergeant
briefly
but
once
inside
we
bound
to
find
it
then
with
the
car
it
in
london
in
forty
minutes
and
in
ten
more
it
where
it
going
to
be
where
that
is
need
worry
you
my
dear
sergeant
what
if
we
seen
from
the
road
urged
the
pessimistic
sergeant
there
never
a
job
about
which
you
ca
put
those
questions
what
if
ludendorff
had
known
just
what
foch
was
going
to
do
sergeant
at
any
rate
anybody
who
sees
us
is
two
miles
either
way
from
a
police
station
and
may
be
a
lot
farther
if
he
tries
to
interfere
with
us
it
a
hundred
to
one
against
anybody
being
on
the
road
at
that
time
of
night
we
pray
for
a
dark
night
and
dirty
weather
which
so
far
as
i
observed
you
generally
get
in
this
beastly
neighborhood
he
leant
forward
and
tapped
the
sergeant
on
the
shoulder
barring
accidents
let
say
this
day
week
meanwhile
neddy
he
smiled
as
he
interjected
neddy
is
our
chauffeur
neddy
and
i
will
make
our
little
plan
of
attack
do
be
too
generous
do
leave
all
the
chances
to
me
the
sergeant
implored
neddy
fair
glutton
for
difficulty
is
to
keep
him
from
murder
and
he
stands
six
foot
four
and
weighs
seventeen
stone
ill
back
him
up
from
company
in
support
grinned
the
sergeant
considerably
comforted
by
this
description
of
his
coadjutor
you
occupy
the
station
assigned
to
you
my
man
said
bennett
with
an
admirable
burlesque
of
the
military
manner
the
front
is
wherever
a
soldier
is
ordered
to
be
a
fine
saying
of
lord
kitchener
remember
it
sergeant
yes
sir
said
the
sergeant
grinning
still
he
found
bennett
on
the
whole
amusing
company
though
occasionally
rather
alarming
for
instance
there
seemed
to
him
to
be
no
particular
reason
for
dragging
in
neddy
predilection
for
murder
though
of
course
a
man
of
his
inches
and
weight
might
commit
murder
through
some
trifling
and
pardonable
miscalculation
of
force
same
as
if
that
captain
naylor
hit
you
the
sergeant
reflected
as
he
finished
the
ample
portion
of
rum
with
which
the
conversation
had
been
lightened
he
felt
pleasantly
muzzy
and
saw
bennett
cleancut
features
rather
blurred
in
outline
however
the
sandy
wig
and
red
mustache
which
that
gentleman
wore
in
his
character
as
a
boxing
day
excursionist
were
still
salient
features
even
to
his
eyes
anybody
in
the
room
would
have
been
able
to
swear
to
them
thus
the
date
of
the
attack
was
settled
and
if
only
it
had
been
adhered
to
things
might
have
fallen
out
differently
between
doctor
mary
and
beaumaroy
events
would
probably
have
relieved
mary
from
the
necessity
of
presenting
her
ultimatum
and
she
might
never
have
heard
that
illuminating
word
morocco
but
big
neddy
the
shover
as
his
intimate
friends
were
wont
to
call
him
was
a
man
of
pleasure
as
well
as
of
business
he
was
not
a
bloke
in
an
office
he
liked
an
ample
christmas
vacation
and
was
now
taking
one
with
a
party
of
friends
at
brighton
all
who
did
the
thing
in
style
and
spent
their
money
which
was
not
their
money
lavishly
from
the
attraction
of
this
company
not
composed
of
gentlemen
only
neddy
refused
to
be
separated
bennett
who
was
on
thorns
at
the
delay
could
take
it
or
leave
it
at
that
in
any
case
the
job
was
in
neddy
opinion
which
he
expressed
with
that
massive
but
scorn
which
is
an
appanage
of
very
large
men
a
leap
in
the
dark
a
pig
in
a
poke
blind
hookey
for
who
really
knew
how
much
of
the
stuff
the
old
blighter
and
his
pal
had
contrived
to
shift
down
to
the
cottage
in
the
old
brown
bag
sometimes
it
looked
light
sometimes
it
looked
heavy
sometimes
perhaps
it
was
full
of
bricks
in
this
mood
neddy
had
to
be
humored
even
though
gentlemanly
bennett
sat
on
thorns
the
sergeant
repined
less
at
the
delay
he
liked
the
pickings
which
the
job
brought
him
much
better
than
the
job
itself
standing
in
wholesome
dread
of
beaumaroy
it
was
rather
with
resignation
than
with
joy
that
he
received
from
bennett
the
news
that
neddy
had
at
last
named
the
day
that
would
suit
his
high
mightiness
tuesday
the
of
january
it
was
and
as
it
chanced
the
very
day
before
beaumaroy
was
to
start
for
morocco
more
accurately
the
attack
would
be
delivered
on
the
actual
day
of
his
departure
if
he
went
for
it
was
timed
for
one
in
the
morning
an
hour
at
which
the
road
across
the
heath
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
clear
of
traffic
this
was
an
especially
important
point
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
window
of
the
tower
faced
towards
the
road
and
was
but
four
or
five
yards
distant
from
it
after
a
jovial
dinner
rather
too
jovial
in
bennett
opinion
but
that
was
neddy
only
fault
he
would
mix
pleasure
with
business
the
two
set
out
in
an
overland
car
bennett
whom
by
the
way
his
big
friend
neddy
called
mike
and
not
percy
as
might
have
been
expected
assumed
his
sandy
wig
and
red
mustache
as
soon
as
they
were
well
started
neddy
scorned
disguise
for
the
moment
but
he
had
a
mask
in
his
pocket
he
also
had
a
very
nasty
little
club
in
the
same
pocket
whereas
bennett
carried
no
weapon
of
offense
merely
the
tools
of
his
trade
at
which
he
was
singularly
expert
the
friends
had
worked
together
before
though
neddy
reviled
mike
for
a
coward
and
mike
averred
with
curses
that
neddy
would
bring
them
both
to
the
gallows
some
day
yet
they
worked
well
together
and
had
a
respect
for
one
another
each
allowing
for
the
other
idiosyncrasies
the
true
spirit
of
partnership
on
it
alone
can
lasting
and
honorable
success
be
built
just
the
sergeant
says
it
is
does
he
asked
neddy
breaking
a
long
silence
which
indeed
had
lasted
until
they
were
across
putney
bridge
and
climbing
the
hill
yes
and
rotten
at
that
it
ought
to
take
two
minutes
then
be
only
the
window
of
course
we
must
have
a
look
round
first
then
if
the
coast
clear
i
nip
in
and
shove
something
up
against
the
door
of
the
place
while
you
following
the
sergeant
to
stay
on
guard
at
the
door
of
the
house
so
that
we
ca
be
taken
in
the
rear
see
righto
then
well
we
got
to
find
the
stuff
and
when
we
found
it
got
to
carry
it
neddy
do
mind
if
it
a
bit
heavy
do
you
i
do
want
to
overstrain
myself
said
neddy
jocularly
but
i
do
my
best
with
it
only
hope
it
there
it
must
be
there
has
got
wings
has
it
at
any
rate
not
till
you
put
it
in
your
pocket
and
go
out
for
an
evening
with
the
ladies
neddy
paid
this
pleasantry
the
tribute
of
a
laugh
but
he
had
one
more
business
question
to
ask
where
are
we
to
stow
the
car
how
far
off
the
sergeant
has
picked
out
a
big
clump
of
trees
a
hundred
yards
from
the
cottage
on
the
sprotsfield
side
and
about
thirty
yards
from
the
road
pretty
clear
going
to
it
bar
the
bracken
she
do
it
easily
there
she
lie
snug
as
you
like
as
we
go
by
sprotsfield
the
car
wo
have
to
pass
the
cottage
at
all
that
an
advantage
and
yet
not
over
far
to
carry
the
stuff
sounds
all
right
said
neddy
placidly
and
with
a
yawn
have
a
drop
no
i
wo
and
i
wish
you
would
neddy
it
makes
you
and
a
man
does
want
to
be
on
these
jobs
take
the
wheel
a
second
while
i
have
a
drop
said
neddy
just
for
all
the
world
as
if
his
friend
had
not
spoken
he
unscrewed
the
top
of
a
large
flask
and
took
a
very
considerable
drop
it
was
only
after
he
had
done
this
with
great
deliberation
that
he
observed
and
you
go
to
hell
mike
it
dark
ai
it
that
a
bit
of
all
right
he
did
not
speak
again
till
they
were
near
sprotsfield
this
beaumaroy
queer
name
ai
it
he
a
big
chap
ai
he
mike
pretty
fair
but
lord
love
you
a
baby
beside
yourself
well
now
you
told
me
something
the
sergeant
said
about
a
man
as
was
neddy
unlike
his
friend
occasionally
tripped
in
his
english
really
big
oh
that
naylor
captain
naylor
but
he
not
at
the
cottage
not
likely
to
meet
him
praise
be
rather
wish
we
were
i
want
a
little
bit
of
exercise
said
neddy
well
i
do
know
but
what
beaumaroy
might
give
you
that
the
sergeant
got
tales
about
him
at
the
war
oh
blast
these
soldiers
they
ai
no
good
in
what
he
himself
regarded
as
his
spare
hours
that
is
to
say
the
daytime
hours
wherein
the
ordinary
man
labors
neddy
was
a
highly
skilled
craftsman
whose
only
failing
was
a
tendency
to
be
late
in
the
morning
and
to
fall
ill
about
the
festive
seasons
of
the
year
he
made
lenses
and
in
spite
of
the
failing
his
work
had
been
deemed
to
be
of
national
importance
as
indeed
it
was
but
that
did
not
excuse
his
prejudice
against
soldiers
they
passed
through
the
outskirts
of
sprotsfield
mike
to
use
his
more
familiar
name
had
made
a
thorough
exploration
of
the
place
and
his
directions
enabled
his
chauffeur
to
avoid
the
central
and
populous
parts
of
the
town
then
they
came
out
on
to
the
open
heath
passed
old
place
and
presently
about
half
a
mile
from
tower
cottage
found
sergeant
hooper
waiting
for
them
by
the
roadside
it
was
then
hard
on
midnight
a
dark
cloudy
night
very
apt
for
their
purpose
with
a
nod
but
without
a
word
the
sergeant
got
into
the
car
and
in
cautious
whispers
directed
its
course
to
the
shelter
of
the
clump
of
trees
they
reached
it
after
a
few
hundred
yards
of
smooth
road
and
some
thirty
of
bumping
over
the
heath
it
afforded
a
perfect
screen
from
the
road
and
on
the
other
side
there
was
only
untrodden
heath
no
path
or
track
being
visible
near
it
neddy
got
out
of
the
car
but
he
did
not
forget
his
faithful
flask
he
offered
it
to
the
sergeant
in
token
of
approval
good
place
sergeant
he
said
does
credit
to
you
as
a
beginner
here
mate
hold
on
though
it
evident
you
ai
accustomed
to
liquor
glasses
when
i
sits
up
so
late
i
gets
a
kind
of
a
sinking
the
sergeant
explained
apologetically
mike
flashed
a
torch
on
him
for
a
minute
there
was
a
very
uncomfortable
look
in
his
little
squinty
eyes
sergeant
he
said
suavely
but
gravely
my
friend
here
relies
on
you
he
not
a
safe
man
to
disappoint
he
shifted
the
light
suddenly
on
to
neddy
whose
proportions
seemed
to
loom
out
prodigious
from
the
surrounding
darkness
are
you
neddy
no
i
a
sensitive
chap
i
am
said
neddy
smiling
do
you
go
and
hurt
my
pride
in
you
by
any
sign
of
weakness
sergeant
the
sergeant
shivered
a
little
i
game
i
stick
it
he
protested
valorously
you
better
neddy
advised
all
quiet
at
the
cottage
as
you
came
by
asked
mike
quiet
as
the
grave
for
what
i
see
the
sergeant
answered
all
right
mike
where
are
them
sandwiches
i
feel
like
a
bite
one
for
the
sergeant
too
but
no
more
flask
no
you
do
sergeant
when
we
start
mike
in
about
just
nice
time
for
a
snack
oysters
and
stout
for
you
my
darling
said
jovial
neddy
then
with
a
change
of
voice
just
as
well
that
did
pass
us
for
the
sound
of
a
car
came
from
the
road
they
had
just
left
it
was
going
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
and
of
inkston
captain
alec
was
taking
his
betrothed
home
after
a
joyful
evening
of
congratulation
and
welcome
chapter
xii
the
secret
of
the
tower
the
scene
presented
by
the
interior
of
the
tower
when
beaumaroy
softly
opened
the
door
and
signed
to
doctor
mary
to
step
forward
and
look
was
indeed
a
strange
one
a
ridiculous
yet
pathetic
mockery
of
grandeur
the
building
was
a
circular
one
rising
to
a
height
of
some
feet
and
having
a
diameter
of
about
ten
up
to
about
twelve
feet
from
the
floor
its
walls
were
draped
with
red
and
purple
stuffs
of
coarse
material
above
them
the
bare
bricks
and
the
rafters
of
the
roof
showed
naked
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
their
backs
to
the
door
at
which
mary
and
her
companion
stood
were
set
two
small
armchairs
of
plain
and
cheap
make
facing
them
on
a
rough
dais
about
three
feet
high
and
with
two
steps
leading
up
to
it
stood
a
large
and
deep
carved
oaken
armchair
it
too
was
upholstered
in
purple
and
above
and
around
it
were
a
canopy
and
curtains
of
the
same
color
this
strange
erection
was
set
with
its
back
to
the
one
window
that
which
saffron
had
caused
to
be
boarded
up
soon
after
he
entered
into
occupation
the
place
was
lighted
by
candles
two
tall
standards
of
an
ecclesiastical
pattern
one
on
either
side
of
the
great
chair
or
throne
and
each
holding
six
large
candles
all
of
which
were
now
alight
and
about
on
the
throne
his
spare
wasted
figure
set
far
back
in
the
recesses
of
its
deep
cushioned
seat
and
his
feet
resting
on
a
high
hassock
sat
old
saffron
in
his
right
hand
he
grasped
a
scepter
obviously
a
theatrical
property
but
a
handsome
one
of
black
wood
with
gilt
ornamentation
his
left
arm
he
held
close
against
his
side
his
eyes
were
turned
up
towards
the
room
his
lips
were
moving
as
though
he
were
talking
but
no
sound
came
such
was
doctor
mary
first
impression
of
the
scene
but
the
next
moment
she
took
in
another
feature
of
it
not
less
remarkable
to
the
left
of
the
throne
to
her
right
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
facing
it
there
was
a
fireplace
an
empty
grate
though
the
night
was
cold
immediately
in
front
of
it
was
unmistakably
the
excavation
in
the
floor
which
penrose
had
described
at
the
christmas
at
old
place
six
feet
in
length
by
three
in
breadth
and
about
four
feet
deep
against
the
wall
close
by
stood
a
sheet
of
cast
iron
which
evidently
served
to
cover
and
conceal
the
aperture
by
it
was
thrown
down
in
careless
disorder
a
strip
of
the
same
dull
red
baize
as
covered
the
rest
of
the
floor
of
the
tower
by
the
side
of
the
sheet
and
the
piece
of
carpet
there
was
an
old
brown
leather
bag
tradition
and
penrose
had
told
the
truth
here
without
doubt
was
captain
duggle
grave
the
grave
he
had
caused
to
be
dug
for
himself
but
which
be
the
reason
what
it
might
body
had
never
occupied
yet
the
tomb
was
not
entirely
empty
the
floor
of
it
was
strewn
with
gold
to
what
depth
mary
could
not
tell
but
it
was
covered
with
golden
sovereigns
there
must
be
thousands
of
them
they
gleamed
under
the
light
of
the
candles
mary
turned
startled
inquiring
apprehensive
eyes
on
beaumaroy
he
pressed
her
arm
gently
and
whispered
i
tell
you
presently
come
in
he
notice
us
i
expect
in
a
minute
mind
you
curtsey
when
he
sees
you
he
led
her
in
pulling
the
door
to
after
him
and
placed
her
and
himself
in
front
of
the
two
small
armchairs
opposite
saffron
throne
beaumaroy
removed
his
hand
from
her
arm
but
she
caught
his
wrist
in
one
of
hers
and
stood
there
holding
on
to
him
breathing
quickly
her
eyes
now
set
on
the
figure
on
the
throne
the
old
man
lips
had
ceased
to
move
his
eyes
had
closed
he
lay
back
in
the
deep
seat
inert
looking
very
pale
and
waxen
in
the
face
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
he
sat
thus
motionless
and
almost
without
signs
of
life
while
the
two
stood
side
by
side
before
him
mary
glanced
once
at
beaumaroy
his
lips
were
apart
in
that
half
humorous
half
compassionate
smile
there
was
no
hint
of
impatience
in
his
bearing
at
last
saffron
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
them
there
was
intelligence
in
his
look
though
his
body
did
not
move
mary
was
conscious
of
a
low
bow
from
beaumaroy
she
remembered
the
caution
he
had
given
her
and
herself
made
a
deep
curtsey
the
old
man
made
a
slight
inclination
of
his
handsome
white
head
then
after
another
long
pause
a
movement
passed
over
his
body
excepting
his
left
arm
she
saw
that
he
was
trying
to
rise
from
his
seat
but
that
he
had
barely
the
strength
to
achieve
his
purpose
but
he
persisted
in
his
effort
and
in
the
end
rose
slowly
and
tremulously
to
his
feet
then
utterly
without
warning
in
a
sudden
and
shocking
burst
of
that
high
voluble
metallic
speech
which
captain
alec
had
heard
through
the
ceiling
of
the
parlor
he
began
to
address
them
if
indeed
it
were
they
whom
he
addressed
and
not
some
phantom
audience
of
princes
marshals
admirals
or
trembling
re
emits
it
was
difficult
to
hear
the
words
hopeless
to
make
out
the
sense
it
was
a
farrago
of
nonsense
part
of
his
own
inventing
part
as
it
seemed
wild
and
confused
reminiscences
of
the
published
speeches
of
the
man
he
aped
all
strung
together
on
some
invisible
thread
of
insane
reasoning
delivered
with
a
mad
vehemence
and
intensity
that
shook
and
seemed
to
rend
his
feeble
frame
we
must
stop
him
we
must
stop
him
mary
suddenly
whispered
kill
himself
if
he
goes
on
like
this
i
never
been
able
to
stop
him
beaumaroy
whispered
back
hush
if
he
hears
us
speaking
he
be
furious
and
carry
on
worse
the
old
man
blue
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
beaumaroy
of
mary
he
took
no
heed
he
pointed
at
beaumaroy
with
his
scepter
and
from
him
to
the
gleaming
gold
in
captain
duggle
grave
a
streak
of
coherency
a
strand
of
mad
logic
now
ran
through
his
hurtling
words
the
money
was
there
beaumaroy
was
to
take
it
to
take
it
to
morocco
to
raise
the
tribes
to
set
africa
aflame
he
was
to
scatter
it
broadcast
broadcast
there
was
no
end
to
it
do
spare
it
there
millions
millions
of
it
he
shouted
and
achieved
a
weird
wild
majesty
in
a
final
cry
god
with
us
then
he
fell
tumbled
back
in
utter
collapse
into
the
recesses
of
the
great
chair
his
scepter
fell
from
his
nerveless
hand
and
rolled
down
the
steps
of
the
dais
the
impetus
it
gathered
carried
it
rolling
still
across
the
floor
to
the
edge
of
the
open
pit
for
an
instant
it
lay
poised
on
the
edge
and
then
fell
with
a
jangle
of
sound
on
the
carpet
of
golden
coins
that
lined
captain
duggle
grave
quick
get
my
bag
i
left
it
in
the
passage
whispered
mary
as
she
started
forward
up
the
dais
to
the
old
man
side
and
brandy
if
you
got
it
she
called
after
beaumaroy
as
he
turned
to
the
door
to
do
her
bidding
beaumaroy
was
gone
no
more
than
a
minute
when
he
came
back
with
the
bag
hitched
under
his
arm
a
decanter
of
brandy
in
one
band
and
a
glass
in
the
other
mary
was
leaning
over
the
throne
with
her
arm
round
the
old
man
his
eyes
were
open
but
he
was
inert
and
motionless
beaumaroy
poured
out
some
brandy
and
gave
it
into
mary
free
hand
but
when
saffron
saw
beaumaroy
by
his
side
he
gave
a
sudden
twist
of
his
body
wrenched
himself
away
from
mary
arm
and
flung
himself
on
his
trusted
friend
hector
i
in
danger
they
after
me
they
shut
me
up
beaumaroy
put
his
strong
arms
about
the
frail
old
body
oh
no
sir
oh
no
he
said
in
low
comforting
tones
that
the
old
foolishness
sir
if
i
may
so
say
you
perfectly
safe
with
me
you
ought
to
trust
me
by
now
sir
really
you
ought
you
swear
you
swear
it
all
right
hector
right
as
rain
sir
beaumaroy
assured
him
cheerfully
very
feebly
the
old
man
moved
his
right
hand
towards
the
open
grave
plenty
plenty
all
yours
hector
for
for
the
cause
god
with
us
his
head
fell
forward
on
beaumaroy
breast
for
an
instant
again
he
raised
it
and
looked
in
the
face
of
his
friend
a
smile
came
on
his
lips
i
know
i
can
trust
you
i
safe
with
you
hector
his
head
fell
forward
again
his
whole
body
was
relaxed
he
gave
a
sigh
of
peace
beaumaroy
lifted
him
in
his
arms
and
very
gently
set
him
back
in
his
great
chair
placing
his
feet
again
on
the
high
footstool
i
think
it
all
over
he
said
and
mary
saw
tears
in
his
eyes
then
mary
herself
collapsed
she
sank
down
on
the
dais
and
broke
into
weeping
it
had
all
been
so
pitiful
and
somehow
so
terrible
her
quick
tumultuous
sobbing
sounded
through
the
place
which
the
vibrations
of
the
old
man
voice
had
lately
filled
she
felt
beaumaroy
hand
on
her
shoulder
you
must
make
sure
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
must
make
your
examination
with
trembling
hands
she
did
it
she
forced
herself
to
it
beaumaroy
aiding
her
there
was
no
doubt
life
had
left
the
body
which
reason
had
left
long
before
his
weakened
heart
had
not
endured
the
last
strain
of
mad
excitement
the
old
man
was
dead
her
face
showed
beaumaroy
the
result
of
her
examination
if
he
had
ever
doubted
of
it
she
looked
at
him
then
made
a
motion
of
her
hand
towards
the
body
we
must
we
must
she
stammered
the
tears
still
rolling
down
her
cheeks
presently
he
said
there
plenty
of
time
you
not
fit
to
do
that
now
and
no
more
am
i
to
tell
the
truth
we
rest
for
half
an
hour
and
then
get
him
upstairs
and
and
do
the
rest
come
with
me
he
put
his
hand
lightly
within
her
arm
he
will
rest
quietly
on
his
throne
for
a
little
while
he
not
afraid
any
more
he
at
rest
still
with
his
arm
in
mary
he
bent
forward
and
kissed
the
old
man
on
the
forehead
i
shall
miss
you
old
friend
he
said
then
with
gentle
insistence
he
led
mary
away
they
left
the
old
man
propped
up
by
the
high
stool
on
which
his
feet
rested
seated
far
back
in
the
great
chair
hard
by
captain
duggle
grave
where
the
scepter
lay
on
a
carpet
of
gold
the
tall
candles
burnt
on
either
side
of
his
throne
imparting
a
semblance
of
ceremonial
state
thus
died
unmarried
in
the
year
of
his
age
aloysius
william
saffron
formerly
of
exeter
surveyor
and
auctioneer
he
had
run
on
the
whole
a
creditable
course
starting
from
small
beginnings
and
belonging
to
a
family
more
remarkable
for
eccentricity
than
for
any
solid
merit
he
had
built
up
a
good
practice
he
had
made
money
and
put
it
by
he
enjoyed
a
good
name
for
financial
probity
but
he
was
held
to
be
a
vain
fussy
peacocky
fellow
very
also
and
as
beaumaroy
had
indicated
impatient
of
the
family
and
social
obligations
which
most
men
recognize
even
though
often
unwillingly
as
the
years
gathered
upon
his
head
these
characteristics
were
intensified
on
the
occasion
of
some
trifling
in
business
a
rival
cut
him
out
in
a
certain
negotiation
he
threw
up
everything
and
disappeared
from
his
native
town
thenceforward
nothing
was
heard
of
him
there
save
that
he
wrote
occasionally
to
his
cousin
sophia
radbolt
and
her
husband
both
of
whom
he
most
cordially
hated
whose
claims
to
his
notice
regard
or
assistance
he
had
of
late
years
at
least
hotly
resented
yet
he
wrote
to
them
wrote
them
vaunting
and
magniloquent
letters
hinting
darkly
of
great
doings
and
great
riches
in
spite
of
their
opinion
of
him
the
radbolts
came
to
believe
perhaps
half
of
what
he
said
he
was
old
and
without
other
ties
their
thirst
for
his
money
was
greedy
undoubtedly
the
radbolts
would
dearly
have
loved
to
get
hold
of
him
and
somehow
hold
him
fast
when
he
came
to
tower
cottage
it
was
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
he
was
precariously
sane
it
was
only
gradually
that
his
fundamental
and
constitutional
vices
and
foibles
turned
to
a
morbid
growth
first
came
intensified
hatred
and
suspicion
of
the
radbolts
they
were
after
him
and
his
money
then
through
hidden
processes
of
mental
distortion
there
grew
the
conviction
that
he
was
of
high
importance
a
great
man
the
object
of
great
conspiracies
in
which
the
odious
radbolts
were
but
instruments
it
was
no
doubt
the
course
of
public
events
culminating
in
the
great
war
which
gave
to
his
mania
its
special
turn
to
his
delusion
its
monstrous
but
as
doctor
mary
was
aware
by
no
means
unprecedented
character
by
the
time
of
his
meeting
with
beaumaroy
the
delusion
was
complete
through
all
the
second
half
of
he
followed
so
far
as
his
mind
could
now
follow
anything
rationally
in
his
own
person
and
fortunes
the
fate
of
the
man
whom
he
believed
himself
to
be
appropriating
the
hopes
the
fears
the
imagined
ambitions
the
physical
infirmity
of
that
other
self
but
he
wrapped
it
all
in
deep
secrecy
for
as
the
conviction
of
his
true
identity
grew
complete
his
fears
were
multiplied
radbolts
indeed
the
whole
of
christendom
principalities
and
powers
were
on
his
track
they
would
shut
him
up
kill
him
perhaps
cunningly
he
hid
his
secret
save
what
could
not
be
entirely
hidden
the
physical
deformity
but
he
hid
it
with
his
shawl
he
never
ate
out
of
his
own
house
the
combination
was
kept
sedulously
hidden
only
to
beaumaroy
did
he
reveal
the
hidden
thing
and
later
on
beaumaroy
persuasion
he
let
into
the
portentous
secret
one
faithful
servant
beaumaroy
unsavory
retainer
sergeant
hooper
he
never
accepted
hooper
as
more
than
a
distasteful
necessity
somebody
must
wait
on
him
and
do
him
menial
service
he
was
not
feared
indeed
for
surely
such
a
dog
would
not
dare
to
be
false
but
cordially
disliked
beaumaroy
won
him
from
the
beginning
whom
he
conceived
him
to
be
beaumaroy
himself
never
knew
but
he
opened
his
heart
to
him
unreservedly
of
him
he
had
no
suspicion
to
him
he
looked
for
safety
and
for
the
realization
of
his
cherished
dreams
beaumaroy
soothed
his
terrors
and
humored
him
in
all
things
what
was
the
good
of
doing
anything
else
asked
beaumaroy
philosophy
he
loved
beaumaroy
far
more
than
he
had
loved
anybody
except
himself
in
all
his
life
at
the
end
through
the
wild
tangle
of
mad
imaginings
there
ran
this
golden
thread
of
human
affection
it
gave
the
old
man
hours
of
peace
sometimes
almost
of
sanity
so
he
came
to
his
death
directly
indeed
of
a
organic
disease
yet
veritably
and
so
he
sat
now
dead
amidst
his
shabby
parody
of
splendor
he
had
done
with
thrones
he
had
even
done
with
tower
cottage
unless
indeed
his
pale
shade
were
to
hold
nocturnal
converse
with
the
robust
and
flamboyant
ghost
of
captain
duggle
the
one
vaunting
his
unreal
vanished
greatness
mouthing
orations
and
mimicking
pomp
the
other
telling
in
language
garnished
with
strange
and
horrible
oaths
of
those
dark
and
lurid
terrors
which
once
had
driven
him
from
this
very
place
leaving
it
ablaze
behind
a
strange
couple
they
would
make
and
strange
would
be
their
conversation
yet
the
tenement
which
had
housed
the
old
man
deranged
spirit
empty
as
now
it
was
aye
emptier
than
duggle
tomb
was
still
to
be
witness
of
one
more
earthly
scene
and
unwittingly
bear
part
in
it
chapter
xiii
right
of
conquest
what
has
been
related
of
saffron
life
before
he
ascended
the
throne
on
which
he
still
sat
in
the
tower
represented
all
that
beaumaroy
knew
of
his
old
friend
before
they
met
indeed
he
knew
scarcely
as
much
he
told
the
brief
story
to
doctor
mary
in
the
parlor
she
heard
him
listlessly
all
that
was
not
much
to
the
point
on
which
her
thoughts
were
set
and
did
not
answer
the
riddle
which
the
scene
in
the
tower
put
to
her
she
was
calm
now
and
ashamed
that
she
had
ever
lost
her
calmness
well
there
was
the
situation
as
i
understood
it
when
i
took
on
the
job
or
quite
soon
afterwards
he
thought
that
he
was
being
pursued
in
a
sense
he
was
if
these
radbolts
found
out
the
truth
they
certainly
would
pursue
him
try
to
shut
him
up
and
prevent
him
from
making
away
with
his
money
or
leaving
it
to
anybody
else
i
did
at
all
know
at
first
what
a
tidy
lot
he
had
he
hated
the
radbolts
even
after
he
ceased
to
know
them
as
cousins
he
remained
very
conscious
of
them
always
they
were
enemies
spies
secret
service
people
on
his
track
poor
old
boy
well
why
should
they
have
him
and
his
money
i
did
see
it
i
see
it
to
this
day
mary
was
in
saffron
armchair
beaumaroy
stood
before
the
fire
she
looked
up
at
him
they
seem
to
have
more
right
than
anybody
else
and
you
know
you
knew
that
he
was
mad
his
being
mad
gives
them
no
right
oh
well
it
no
use
arguing
in
the
end
i
suppose
they
had
rights
of
a
kind
a
right
by
law
i
suppose
though
i
never
knew
the
law
and
do
want
to
to
shut
the
old
man
up
and
make
him
damned
miserable
and
get
the
money
for
themselves
that
sounds
just
the
sort
of
right
the
law
does
give
people
over
other
people
because
aunt
betsy
married
uncle
john
fifty
years
ago
and
was
probably
infernally
sorry
for
it
mary
smiled
a
matter
of
principle
with
you
was
it
mr
beaumaroy
no
instinct
i
think
it
my
instinct
to
be
against
the
proper
thing
the
regular
thing
the
thing
that
deals
hardly
with
an
individual
in
the
name
of
some
highly
nebulous
general
principle
like
discipline
she
put
in
with
a
reminiscence
of
punnit
he
nodded
yes
that
one
case
of
it
and
then
the
situation
amused
me
i
think
that
had
more
to
do
with
it
than
anything
else
at
first
it
amused
me
to
play
up
to
his
delusions
i
suggested
the
shawl
as
useful
on
our
walks
and
thereby
got
him
to
take
wholesome
exercise
that
ought
to
appeal
to
you
doctor
i
got
him
the
combination
that
made
him
enjoy
his
meals
also
good
for
him
doctor
but
i
did
do
these
things
because
they
were
good
for
him
but
because
they
amused
me
they
never
amused
hooper
he
a
dull
surly
and
i
inclined
to
believe
treacherous
dog
who
is
he
sacked
from
the
army
sent
to
quod
just
a
whom
i
kept
loose
but
the
things
did
amuse
me
and
it
was
that
at
first
but
then
he
paused
looking
at
him
again
mary
saw
a
whimsical
tenderness
expressed
in
his
eyes
and
smile
the
poor
chap
was
so
overwhelmingly
grateful
he
thought
me
the
one
indubitably
faithful
adherent
that
he
had
and
so
i
was
too
though
not
in
the
way
he
thought
and
he
trusted
me
absolutely
well
was
i
to
give
him
up
to
the
law
and
the
radbolts
and
the
jailers
of
an
asylum
a
man
who
trusted
me
like
that
but
he
was
mad
objected
doctor
mary
obstinately
a
man
has
his
feelings
or
may
have
even
when
he
mad
he
trusted
me
and
he
loved
me
doctor
mary
wo
you
allow
that
i
my
case
so
far
she
made
no
sign
of
assent
well
then
i
loved
him
does
that
go
any
better
with
you
if
it
does
i
in
a
bad
way
be
cause
what
giving
you
now
is
the
strong
part
of
my
case
i
do
see
why
you
should
put
what
you
call
your
case
to
me
at
all
mr
beaumaroy
he
looked
at
her
in
a
reproachful
astonishment
but
you
seemed
touched
by
by
what
we
saw
in
the
tower
i
thought
the
old
man
death
and
faith
had
appealed
to
you
it
seems
to
me
that
people
ca
go
through
a
thing
like
that
together
without
feeling
well
some
sort
of
comradeship
but
if
you
no
sort
of
feeling
of
that
kind
well
i
do
want
to
put
my
case
go
on
with
your
case
said
doctor
mary
after
a
moment
silence
though
it
is
really
that
i
want
to
put
a
case
for
myself
at
all
but
i
do
mind
owning
that
i
like
you
to
understand
about
it
before
i
clear
out
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
but
put
no
spoken
question
beaumaroy
sat
down
on
the
stool
opposite
to
her
and
poked
the
fire
i
ca
get
away
from
it
can
i
there
was
something
else
you
saw
in
the
tower
was
there
and
i
dare
say
that
you
connect
it
with
a
conversation
that
we
had
together
a
little
while
ago
well
i
tell
you
about
that
oh
well
of
course
i
must
must
i
i
should
like
to
hear
her
bitterness
was
gone
he
had
come
now
to
the
riddle
he
was
a
king
to
himself
beaumaroy
resumed
thoughtfully
but
in
fact
i
was
king
over
him
i
could
do
anything
i
liked
with
him
i
had
him
i
possessed
him
by
right
of
conquest
the
right
of
conquest
seemed
a
big
thing
to
me
it
was
about
the
only
sort
of
right
that
i
seen
anything
of
for
three
years
and
more
yes
it
was
and
is
a
big
thing
a
real
thing
the
one
right
in
the
whole
world
that
there
no
doubt
about
other
rights
are
theories
views
preachments
right
of
conquest
is
a
fact
i
had
it
i
could
make
him
do
what
i
liked
say
what
i
liked
sign
what
i
liked
do
you
begin
to
see
where
i
found
myself
i
say
found
myself
because
really
it
was
a
surprise
to
me
at
first
i
thought
he
was
in
a
pretty
small
way
he
only
gave
me
a
hundred
a
year
besides
my
keep
true
he
always
talked
of
his
money
but
i
set
that
down
mainly
to
his
delusion
but
it
was
true
that
he
had
a
lot
really
a
lot
a
good
bit
besides
what
you
saw
in
there
he
must
have
speculated
cleverly
i
think
he
could
have
made
it
all
in
his
business
doctor
mary
how
much
gold
do
you
think
there
is
in
the
grave
in
there
i
have
the
least
idea
thousands
where
did
you
get
it
oh
yes
thousands
and
thousands
we
got
it
mostly
from
the
aliens
in
the
east
end
they
hoarded
it
you
know
but
they
were
willing
to
sell
at
a
premium
the
premium
rose
up
to
last
month
then
it
dropped
a
little
not
much
though
because
we
exhausted
some
of
the
most
obvious
sources
i
carried
every
sovereign
of
that
money
in
the
grave
down
from
london
in
my
brown
bag
he
smiled
reflectively
do
you
know
how
much
a
thousand
sovereigns
weigh
doctor
mary
i
have
the
least
idea
said
mary
again
she
was
leaning
forward
now
listening
intently
and
watching
beaumaroy
face
with
absorbed
interest
seventeen
and
pounds
avoirdupois
that
the
correct
weight
the
first
time
or
two
we
did
get
much
they
were
still
shy
of
us
but
after
that
we
made
some
heavy
hauls
twice
we
brought
down
close
on
two
thousand
once
there
was
three
thousand
almost
to
a
sovereign
even
men
trained
to
the
work
bullion
porters
as
they
call
them
at
the
bank
of
england
reckon
five
bags
of
a
thousand
canvas
bags
not
much
short
of
a
foot
long
and
six
inches
across
you
know
they
reckon
five
of
them
a
full
load
and
would
care
to
go
far
with
them
either
the
equivalent
of
three
of
them
was
quite
enough
for
me
to
carry
from
inkston
station
up
to
the
cottage
trying
to
look
as
if
i
were
carrying
nothing
of
any
account
one
has
got
to
pretend
to
be
carrying
nothing
in
full
marching
kit
nor
to
carry
it
all
in
one
hand
and
he
never
trust
himself
in
a
cab
might
be
kidnapped
you
see
i
do
know
exactly
but
from
what
he
said
i
reckon
we
brought
down
on
our
wednesday
trips
about
of
all
he
had
now
you
probably
gathered
what
his
idea
was
he
knew
he
was
disguised
as
saffron
and
very
proud
of
the
way
he
lived
up
to
the
character
as
saffron
he
realized
the
money
by
driblets
turned
his
securities
into
notes
his
notes
into
gold
but
lost
all
knowledge
that
the
money
was
his
own
made
by
himself
himself
saffron
he
thought
it
was
saved
out
of
the
wreck
of
his
imperial
fortune
it
was
to
be
dedicated
to
restoring
the
imperial
cause
he
himself
could
not
attempt
at
present
to
get
out
of
england
least
of
all
carrying
pots
of
gold
coin
but
he
believed
that
i
could
i
was
to
go
to
morocco
and
so
on
and
raise
the
country
for
him
taking
as
much
as
i
could
and
coming
back
for
more
he
had
no
doubt
at
all
of
my
coming
back
in
fact
it
would
have
been
much
easier
for
me
to
get
out
of
the
country
with
the
money
than
it
would
have
been
for
the
authentic
kaiser
himself
but
doctor
mary
what
would
have
been
possible
was
for
me
to
go
somewhere
else
or
even
back
to
the
places
we
knew
of
for
no
questions
were
asked
there
put
that
money
back
into
notes
or
securities
in
my
own
name
and
tell
him
i
had
carried
out
the
morocco
programme
he
had
no
sense
of
time
he
would
have
suspected
nothing
that
would
have
been
mere
and
sheer
robbery
said
mary
oh
yes
it
would
beaumaroy
agreed
and
if
i
done
it
and
deserted
him
i
should
have
deserved
to
be
hanged
that
was
hardly
my
question
as
long
as
he
lived
i
meant
to
stick
by
him
but
he
was
turned
seventy
frail
with
and
as
i
understand
quite
likely
to
sink
into
general
paralysis
well
if
i
was
to
exercise
my
right
of
conquest
and
get
the
fruits
of
conquest
two
ways
seemed
open
there
could
be
a
will
you
remember
my
consulting
you
on
that
point
and
your
reply
did
he
make
a
will
asked
mary
quickly
no
a
will
was
open
to
serious
objections
even
supposing
your
evidence
which
of
course
i
wanted
in
case
of
need
had
been
satisfactory
a
fight
with
the
radbolts
would
have
been
unpleasant
worse
than
that
as
long
as
i
lived
i
should
have
been
blackmailed
by
sergeant
hooper
who
knew
saffron
condition
though
he
did
know
about
the
money
here
even
before
you
found
out
about
my
poor
old
friend
i
had
decided
against
a
will
though
perhaps
i
might
have
squared
the
radbolts
by
just
taking
this
little
place
and
its
contents
and
letting
them
take
the
rest
that
too
became
impossible
after
your
discovery
there
remained
then
the
money
in
the
tower
i
could
make
quite
sure
of
that
wait
for
his
death
and
then
enjoy
it
and
upon
my
word
why
should
i
he
have
been
much
gratified
by
my
going
to
morocco
and
he
certainly
much
sooner
that
i
had
the
money
if
it
could
go
to
morocco
than
that
the
radbolts
should
get
it
that
was
the
way
the
question
presented
itself
to
me
and
i
a
poor
man
with
no
obvious
career
before
me
the
right
of
conquest
appealed
to
me
strongly
doctor
mary
i
can
see
that
you
may
have
been
greatly
tempted
said
mary
in
a
grave
and
troubled
voice
and
the
circumstances
did
enable
you
to
make
excuses
for
what
you
thought
of
doing
excuses
you
wo
even
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
a
doubtful
case
one
that
a
casuist
could
argue
either
way
beaumaroy
was
smiling
again
now
even
if
i
did
men
of
yes
doctor
mary
of
sensitive
honor
decide
doubtful
cases
against
themselves
in
money
matters
oh
i
say
is
that
doctrine
current
in
business
circles
i
been
in
business
myself
and
i
doubt
it
they
do
men
of
real
honor
mary
persisted
so
that
how
great
fortunes
are
made
that
how
individuals
to
say
nothing
of
nations
rise
to
wealth
and
power
and
i
never
knew
it
beaumaroy
reflected
in
a
gentle
voice
his
eye
caught
mary
and
she
gave
a
little
laugh
by
deciding
doubtful
cases
against
themselves
dear
me
yes
i
did
say
they
rose
to
greatness
and
power
then
the
people
who
do
rise
to
greatness
and
power
and
the
nations
do
they
go
by
right
of
conquest
doctor
mary
do
they
decide
cases
in
their
own
favor
did
you
really
mean
to
to
take
the
money
i
tell
you
as
near
as
i
can
i
meant
to
do
my
best
for
my
old
man
i
meant
him
to
live
as
long
as
he
could
and
to
live
free
unpersecuted
as
happy
as
he
could
be
made
i
meant
that
because
i
loved
him
and
he
loved
me
well
i
lost
him
i
alone
in
the
world
the
last
words
were
no
appeal
to
mary
for
the
moment
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
he
was
speaking
out
of
his
own
heart
to
himself
yet
the
words
thereby
touched
her
to
a
livelier
pity
you
are
very
lonely
when
there
is
nobody
to
whom
you
have
affection
right
to
complain
of
loneliness
but
after
that
if
i
saw
him
to
his
end
in
peace
if
i
brought
that
off
well
then
i
rather
think
that
i
should
have
stuck
to
the
money
yes
i
rather
think
so
you
managed
to
mix
things
up
so
mary
complained
your
devotion
to
saffron
for
that
i
could
forgive
you
keeping
his
secret
and
fooling
me
and
all
of
us
but
then
you
mix
that
up
with
the
money
it
was
mixed
up
with
it
i
did
do
the
mixing
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
she
asked
with
a
sudden
curiosity
oh
now
now
the
thing
all
different
you
seen
you
know
and
even
i
ca
offer
you
a
partnership
in
the
cash
can
i
if
i
were
an
infernally
poor
conspirator
i
should
have
covered
up
the
grave
and
made
everything
neat
and
tidy
before
i
came
to
fetch
you
because
i
knew
he
might
go
back
to
the
tower
on
his
bad
nights
he
always
made
me
open
the
grave
and
spread
out
the
money
make
a
show
of
it
you
know
then
it
had
to
be
put
back
in
bags
the
money
bags
lived
in
the
brown
leather
bag
and
the
grave
had
to
be
fastened
down
altogether
it
was
a
good
bit
of
work
i
just
got
it
open
and
the
money
spread
out
when
he
turned
bad
a
sort
of
collapse
like
the
one
you
saw
and
i
was
so
busy
getting
him
to
bed
that
i
forgot
the
cursed
grave
and
the
money
just
as
i
forgot
to
put
away
the
before
you
called
the
first
time
and
you
saw
through
me
if
you
not
a
good
conspirator
it
another
reason
for
not
conspiring
beaumaroy
i
know
you
conspired
for
him
first
of
all
but
well
he
safe
he
at
peace
it
can
all
come
out
now
and
it
must
you
know
and
you
must
tell
the
truth
i
do
know
whether
they
can
put
me
in
prison
i
should
hardly
think
they
bother
if
they
get
the
money
all
right
in
any
case
i
do
care
much
lord
what
a
lot
of
say
told
you
so
bad
egg
that
beaumaroy
no
i
do
care
my
old
man
safe
i
won
my
big
game
after
all
doctor
mary
i
do
believe
you
cared
about
the
money
really
she
cried
that
really
was
a
game
to
you
i
think
a
trick
you
liked
to
play
on
us
respectables
he
smiled
at
her
confidentially
i
do
like
beating
the
respectables
he
admitted
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
must
do
what
has
to
be
done
for
the
old
man
but
it
late
hard
on
one
you
must
be
tired
and
it
a
sad
job
no
i
help
you
i
i
been
in
hospitals
you
know
only
do
go
first
and
cover
up
that
horrible
place
and
hide
that
wretched
money
before
i
go
into
the
tower
will
you
she
gave
a
shiver
as
her
imagination
renewed
the
scene
which
the
tower
held
you
need
come
into
the
tower
at
all
he
as
light
as
a
feather
lifted
him
into
bed
often
i
can
lift
him
now
if
you
really
wish
to
help
will
you
go
up
to
his
room
and
get
things
ready
as
he
spoke
he
crossed
to
the
sideboard
took
up
a
bedroom
candlestick
and
lighted
it
from
one
that
stood
on
the
table
and
you
see
about
the
body
being
taken
to
the
mortuary
wo
you
i
shall
communicate
with
the
radbolts
fully
they
take
charge
of
the
funeral
i
suppose
well
he
wo
know
anything
about
that
now
thank
god
there
was
the
slightest
tremor
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
mary
did
not
take
the
candle
i
said
some
hard
things
to
you
beaumaroy
i
dare
say
i
sounded
very
he
raised
his
hand
in
protest
but
she
went
on
so
i
should
like
to
say
one
different
thing
to
you
since
we
to
part
after
you
shown
yourself
a
good
friend
good
and
true
as
a
man
could
have
i
loved
my
old
man
said
beaumaroy
it
was
his
only
plea
to
mary
it
seemed
a
good
one
he
had
loved
his
poor
old
madman
and
he
had
served
him
faithfully
yes
the
old
man
found
a
good
friend
in
you
i
hope
you
will
find
good
friends
too
oh
i
do
hope
it
because
that
what
you
want
i
should
be
very
glad
if
i
could
think
that
in
spite
of
everything
i
had
found
one
here
in
this
place
even
although
she
can
be
a
friend
only
in
memory
mary
paused
for
a
moment
then
gave
him
her
hand
i
know
you
much
better
after
tonight
my
memory
of
you
will
be
a
kind
one
now
to
our
work
yes
and
thank
you
i
thank
you
more
deeply
than
you
imagine
he
gave
her
the
candle
and
followed
her
to
the
passage
you
know
where
the
room
is
i
shall
put
the
the
place
straight
and
then
bring
him
up
i
be
many
minutes
ten
perhaps
the
rather
hard
to
fit
mary
nodded
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
strained
by
the
events
of
the
night
and
by
the
talk
to
beaumaroy
she
was
again
near
tears
her
eyes
were
bright
in
the
light
of
the
candle
and
told
of
nervous
excitement
beaumaroy
went
back
into
the
parlor
on
his
way
to
the
tower
suddenly
he
stopped
and
stood
dead
still
listening
intently
mary
busied
herself
upstairs
making
her
preparations
with
practiced
skill
and
readiness
her
agitation
did
not
interfere
with
her
work
there
her
training
told
but
of
her
inner
mind
it
had
full
possession
she
was
afraid
to
be
alone
there
in
that
cottage
she
longed
for
another
clasp
of
that
friendly
hand
well
he
would
come
soon
but
he
must
bring
his
burden
with
him
when
she
had
finished
what
she
had
to
do
she
sat
down
and
waited
beaumaroy
waited
too
outside
the
door
leading
to
the
tower
chapter
xiv
the
scepter
in
the
grave
sergeant
hooper
took
up
his
appointed
position
on
the
flagged
path
that
led
up
to
the
cottage
door
his
primary
task
was
to
give
warning
if
anybody
should
come
out
of
the
door
a
secondary
one
was
to
give
the
alarm
in
case
of
interruption
by
on
the
road
an
unlikely
peril
this
latter
in
view
of
the
hour
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
practiced
noiselessness
with
which
mike
might
be
relied
upon
to
do
his
work
here
then
the
sergeant
was
left
after
being
accorded
another
nip
from
the
flask
which
however
neddy
kept
in
his
own
hands
this
time
and
a
whispered
but
vigorously
worded
exhortation
to
keep
up
his
courage
neddy
the
shover
and
gentlemanly
mike
tiptoed
off
to
the
window
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
door
as
one
approached
the
house
from
the
road
the
bottom
of
the
window
was
about
seven
feet
from
the
ground
neddy
bent
down
and
offered
his
broad
back
as
a
platform
to
his
companion
mike
mounted
thereon
and
began
his
work
that
in
itself
was
child
play
to
him
the
matchboarding
was
but
lightly
nailed
on
the
fastenings
came
away
in
a
moment
under
the
skillful
application
of
his
instrument
the
window
sash
behind
was
not
even
bolted
for
the
bolt
had
perished
with
time
and
had
not
been
replaced
so
far
very
good
but
at
this
early
point
mike
received
his
first
surprise
he
could
not
see
much
of
the
interior
a
tall
curtain
stretched
across
the
entire
breadth
of
the
window
distant
about
two
feet
from
it
but
he
could
see
that
the
room
was
lighted
up
very
cautiously
he
completed
his
work
on
the
matchboarding
handing
down
each
plank
to
neddy
when
he
had
detached
it
then
he
cut
out
a
pane
of
glass
it
was
all
to
him
put
his
hand
in
and
raised
the
sash
a
little
then
it
was
simple
to
push
it
up
from
below
but
the
sash
had
not
been
raised
for
years
it
stuck
when
it
yielded
to
his
efforts
it
gave
a
loud
creak
he
flung
one
leg
over
the
and
sat
poised
there
listening
the
room
was
lighted
up
but
if
there
were
anyone
in
it
he
must
be
asleep
or
very
hard
of
hearing
or
that
creak
would
have
aroused
his
attention
released
from
his
office
as
a
support
neddy
rose
and
hauled
himself
up
by
his
arms
till
he
could
see
in
the
window
lights
he
whispered
mike
nodded
and
got
in
on
the
dais
behind
the
curtain
neddy
scrambled
up
after
him
finding
some
help
from
a
stunted
but
sturdy
old
apple
tree
that
grew
against
the
wall
now
they
were
both
inside
behind
the
tall
curtain
come
on
mike
whispered
we
must
see
if
there
anybody
here
and
if
there
is
put
out
the
light
for
on
either
side
of
the
curtain
there
was
room
for
a
streak
of
light
which
might
by
chance
be
seen
from
the
road
mike
advanced
round
the
edge
of
the
curtain
he
had
perceived
by
now
that
it
formed
the
back
of
some
structure
though
he
could
not
yet
see
of
what
nature
the
structure
was
nor
was
he
now
examining
for
as
he
stepped
out
on
the
dais
at
the
side
of
the
canopy
his
eyes
were
engrossed
by
another
feature
of
this
strange
apartment
he
stretched
back
his
hand
and
caught
hold
of
neddy
brawny
arm
pulling
him
forward
see
that
that
hole
neddy
for
the
moment
they
forgot
the
lights
they
forgot
the
possibility
of
an
occupant
of
the
room
which
indeed
was
save
for
their
own
whispers
absolutely
still
they
stood
looking
at
the
strange
hole
and
then
into
one
another
faces
for
a
few
seconds
then
they
stole
softly
nearer
to
it
that
a
blasted
funny
breathed
neddy
look
like
a
bloke
mike
fingers
squeezed
his
arm
tighter
evidently
again
claiming
his
attention
my
hat
we
need
look
far
for
the
stuff
he
whispered
an
uneasy
whisper
it
was
the
whole
place
looked
queer
and
that
hole
was
uncanny
it
had
its
contents
yet
they
approached
nearer
they
came
to
the
edge
and
stood
looking
in
as
though
he
could
not
believe
the
mere
sight
of
his
eyes
big
neddy
crouched
down
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
up
saffron
scepter
with
a
look
of
amazement
he
held
it
up
for
his
inspection
mike
eyed
it
uneasily
but
his
thoughts
were
getting
back
to
business
he
stole
softly
off
to
the
door
with
intent
to
see
whether
it
was
locked
he
stooped
down
to
examine
it
and
perceived
that
it
was
not
it
would
be
well
then
to
barricade
it
and
he
turned
round
to
look
for
some
heavy
bit
of
furniture
suitable
for
his
purpose
something
that
would
delay
the
entrance
of
an
intruder
and
give
them
notice
of
the
interruption
as
he
turned
his
body
suddenly
stiffened
only
his
trained
instinct
prevented
him
from
crying
out
there
was
an
occupant
of
the
room
there
in
the
great
chair
between
the
tall
candlesticks
on
the
dais
an
old
man
sat
half
lay
there
asleep
it
seemed
his
eyes
were
shut
the
color
of
his
face
struck
gentleman
mike
as
being
peculiar
but
everything
in
that
place
was
peculiar
like
a
great
tomb
a
blooming
mausoleum
the
whole
place
was
though
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
mike
felt
uncomfortable
cold
and
clammy
too
the
beastly
place
was
still
business
is
business
letting
the
matter
of
the
unlocked
door
wait
for
the
moment
he
began
to
steal
catlike
across
the
floor
towards
the
dais
he
had
to
investigate
also
he
really
ought
to
put
out
those
candles
it
was
utterly
unprofessional
to
leave
them
alight
but
he
could
not
conquer
a
feeling
that
the
place
would
seem
still
more
peculiar
when
they
were
put
out
big
neddy
eyes
had
not
followed
his
comrade
to
the
door
they
had
been
held
by
the
queer
hole
and
its
queer
contents
by
the
gleaming
gold
that
strewed
its
floor
by
the
mock
symbol
of
majesty
which
he
had
lifted
from
it
and
still
held
in
his
hand
by
the
oddly
suggestive
shape
and
dimensions
of
the
hole
itself
but
now
he
raised
his
eyes
from
these
things
and
looked
across
at
mike
mutely
asking
what
he
thought
of
matters
he
saw
mike
stealing
across
the
floor
looking
very
very
hard
at
something
mute
as
neddy
inquiry
was
mike
seemed
somehow
aware
of
it
he
raised
his
hand
as
though
to
enjoin
silence
and
then
pointed
it
in
front
of
him
raised
to
the
level
of
his
head
neddy
turned
round
to
look
in
the
direction
indicated
he
saw
the
throne
and
its
silent
occupant
the
old
man
who
sat
there
seeming
to
preside
over
the
scene
whose
head
was
turned
towards
him
whose
closed
eyes
would
open
directly
on
his
face
if
their
lids
were
lifted
neddy
feared
no
living
man
so
he
was
accustomed
to
boast
and
with
good
warrant
but
was
that
man
living
how
came
he
up
there
and
what
had
he
to
do
with
the
hole
that
had
all
that
gold
in
it
and
the
thing
he
held
in
his
own
hand
did
that
belong
to
the
old
man
up
there
had
he
flung
it
into
the
hole
or
odd
fancies
began
to
assail
big
neddy
had
he
left
it
behind
him
when
he
got
out
and
would
he
by
chance
come
down
to
look
for
it
mike
hand
stretched
out
from
his
body
towards
his
friend
now
again
enjoined
silence
he
was
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
he
was
going
up
its
steps
he
was
no
good
in
a
scrap
but
he
had
a
nerve
in
some
things
he
was
up
the
steps
now
and
leaning
forward
he
was
looking
hard
in
the
old
man
face
his
own
was
close
to
it
he
laid
hold
of
one
of
the
old
arms
it
happened
to
be
that
left
arm
of
saffron
lifted
it
and
let
it
fall
again
it
fell
back
just
in
the
position
from
which
he
had
lifted
it
then
he
straightened
himself
up
looking
a
trifle
green
perhaps
but
reassured
and
called
out
to
mike
in
a
penetrating
whisper
he
a
stiff
un
all
right
yes
but
then
what
of
the
grave
because
it
was
a
grave
and
nothing
else
there
was
no
getting
away
from
it
what
of
the
grave
and
what
about
the
scepter
and
what
was
mike
going
to
do
now
he
was
tiptoeing
to
the
edge
of
the
dais
he
was
moving
towards
one
of
the
high
candlesticks
the
top
of
which
was
a
little
below
the
level
of
his
head
as
he
stood
raised
on
the
dais
beside
the
throne
he
leant
forward
towards
the
candles
his
intent
was
obvious
but
big
neddy
was
not
minded
that
he
should
carry
it
out
could
not
suffer
him
to
do
it
with
the
light
of
the
candles
well
at
all
events
you
could
see
what
was
happening
you
could
see
where
you
were
and
where
anybody
else
was
but
in
the
dark
left
to
torches
which
illuminated
only
bits
of
the
place
and
which
perhaps
you
might
switch
on
in
time
or
turn
in
the
right
direction
if
you
were
left
like
that
anybody
might
be
anywhere
and
on
to
you
before
you
knew
it
let
them
lights
alone
mike
he
whispered
hoarsely
i
smash
your
in
if
you
put
them
lights
out
mike
had
conquered
his
own
fit
of
nerves
not
without
some
exercise
of
will
and
had
not
given
any
notice
to
his
companion
which
was
considerably
more
acute
perhaps
the
constant
use
of
that
roomy
flask
had
contributed
to
that
though
lack
of
a
liberal
education
such
as
mike
had
enjoyed
and
misused
must
also
bear
its
share
of
responsibility
he
was
amazed
at
this
violent
and
threatening
interruption
he
gave
a
funny
little
skip
backwards
on
the
dais
his
heel
came
thereby
in
contact
with
the
high
hassock
on
which
saffron
feet
rested
the
hassock
was
shifted
one
foot
fell
from
it
on
to
the
dais
and
saffron
body
fell
a
little
forward
from
out
of
the
deep
recess
of
his
great
chair
to
big
neddy
perturbed
imagination
it
looked
as
if
saffron
had
set
one
foot
upon
the
floor
of
the
dais
and
was
going
to
rise
from
his
seat
perhaps
to
come
down
from
the
dais
to
come
nearer
to
his
grave
to
ask
for
his
scepter
it
was
too
much
for
neddy
he
shuddered
he
could
not
help
it
and
the
scepter
dropped
from
his
hand
it
fell
from
his
hand
back
into
the
grave
again
under
its
impact
the
gold
coins
in
the
grave
again
jangled
beaumaroy
had
by
this
time
been
standing
close
outside
the
door
for
about
two
minutes
he
had
lighted
a
cigarette
from
the
candle
on
the
parlor
table
the
sounds
that
he
thought
he
heard
were
not
conclusive
creaks
and
cracks
did
sometimes
come
from
the
window
and
the
rafters
of
the
roof
but
the
sound
of
the
jangling
gold
was
conclusive
it
must
be
due
in
some
way
to
human
agency
and
in
the
circumstances
human
agency
must
mean
a
thief
beaumaroy
mind
leapt
to
the
sergeant
ten
to
one
it
was
the
sergeant
he
had
long
been
after
the
secret
he
had
at
last
sniffed
it
out
and
was
helping
himself
it
seemed
to
beaumaroy
a
disgusting
thing
to
do
with
the
dead
man
sitting
there
but
that
was
sentiment
sentiment
was
not
to
be
expected
of
the
sergeant
and
disgusting
things
were
then
he
suddenly
recalled
alec
naylor
story
of
the
two
men
one
tall
and
slight
one
short
and
stumpy
who
had
reconnoitered
tower
cottage
the
sergeant
had
an
accomplice
no
doubt
he
listened
again
he
heard
the
scrape
of
metal
on
metal
as
when
a
man
gathers
up
coins
in
his
hand
out
of
a
heap
yet
he
stood
where
he
was
smoking
still
thoughts
were
passing
rapidly
through
his
brain
and
they
brought
a
smile
to
his
lips
let
them
take
it
why
not
it
was
no
care
to
him
now
doctor
mary
had
to
tell
the
truth
about
it
and
so
consequently
had
he
himself
it
belonged
to
the
radbolts
oh
damn
the
radbolts
he
would
have
risked
his
life
for
it
if
the
old
man
had
lived
but
he
was
going
to
risk
his
life
for
the
radbolts
let
the
rascals
get
off
with
the
stuff
or
as
much
as
they
could
carry
he
was
all
right
doctor
mary
could
testify
that
he
had
taken
it
let
them
carry
off
the
infernal
stuff
incidentally
he
would
be
well
rid
of
the
sergeant
and
free
from
any
of
his
importunities
from
whines
and
threats
alike
it
was
not
an
unimportant
if
a
minor
consideration
yet
it
was
a
disgusting
thing
to
do
it
certainly
was
and
the
sergeant
would
think
that
he
had
scored
a
triumph
over
his
benefactor
too
his
protector
beaumaroy
reflected
with
a
satiric
smile
the
sergeant
certainly
deserved
a
fright
and
if
possible
a
licking
these
administered
he
could
be
kicked
out
perhaps
oh
yes
poor
brute
with
a
handful
of
the
radbolts
money
they
would
never
miss
it
as
they
did
not
know
how
much
there
was
and
such
a
diversion
of
their
legal
property
in
no
way
troubled
beaumaroy
conscience
and
the
accomplice
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
sergeant
was
as
he
well
knew
from
his
military
experience
of
that
worthy
man
an
arrant
coward
he
would
show
no
fight
if
the
accomplice
did
beaumaroy
was
quite
in
the
mood
to
oblige
him
but
while
he
tackled
one
fellow
the
other
might
get
off
with
the
money
with
as
much
as
he
could
carry
for
all
that
it
was
merely
radbolt
money
now
in
the
end
beaumaroy
could
not
stomach
the
idea
of
that
the
idea
that
either
of
the
dirty
rogues
in
there
should
get
off
with
the
money
and
it
was
foolish
to
attack
them
on
the
front
on
which
they
expected
to
be
attacked
quickly
his
mind
formed
another
plan
he
turned
stole
softly
out
of
the
parlor
and
along
the
passage
towards
the
front
door
of
the
cottage
after
neddy
had
dropped
saffron
scepter
into
captain
duggle
grave
had
he
known
that
it
was
captain
duggle
and
not
been
a
prey
to
the
ridiculous
but
haunting
fancy
that
it
had
been
destined
for
or
even
oh
these
errant
fancies
already
occupied
by
saffron
himself
neddy
would
have
been
less
agitated
mike
dealt
with
him
roundly
in
bitter
hissing
whispers
and
in
language
suited
thereto
he
pointed
out
the
folly
of
vain
superstitions
of
childish
fears
and
sick
imaginings
which
interfered
with
business
and
threatened
its
success
his
eloquent
reasoning
combined
with
a
lively
desire
to
get
out
of
the
place
as
soon
as
possible
so
far
wrought
on
neddy
that
he
produced
the
sack
which
he
had
brought
with
him
and
held
its
mouth
open
though
with
trembling
hands
while
mike
scraped
up
handful
after
handful
of
gold
coins
and
poured
them
into
it
they
were
busily
engaged
on
their
joint
task
as
beaumaroy
stole
along
the
passage
and
reaching
the
front
door
again
stood
listening
the
sergeant
was
still
keeping
his
vigil
before
the
door
he
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
locked
did
not
beaumaroy
see
wiles
and
himself
out
of
it
every
evening
the
back
door
to
the
little
house
led
only
on
to
the
heath
behind
and
gave
no
direct
access
to
the
road
and
lock
it
after
them
with
a
squeaking
key
he
would
have
warning
enough
if
anyone
turned
the
key
now
he
was
looking
towards
the
road
a
surprise
was
more
possible
from
that
quarter
his
back
was
towards
the
door
and
only
a
very
little
way
from
it
but
when
beaumaroy
had
entered
with
doctor
mary
he
had
not
the
door
he
opened
it
now
very
gently
and
cautiously
and
saw
the
back
there
was
no
mistaking
it
without
letting
his
surprise
for
he
had
confidently
supposed
the
sergeant
to
be
in
the
tower
interfere
with
the
instant
action
called
for
by
the
circumstances
he
flung
out
his
long
right
arm
caught
the
sergeant
round
the
neck
with
a
throttling
grip
and
dragged
him
backwards
into
the
house
the
man
was
incapable
of
crying
out
no
sound
escaped
from
him
which
could
reach
the
tower
beaumaroy
set
him
softly
on
the
floor
of
the
passage
if
you
stir
or
speak
strangle
you
he
whispered
there
was
enough
light
from
the
passage
lamp
to
enable
the
sergeant
to
judge
by
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
spoke
sincerely
the
sergeant
did
not
dare
even
to
rub
his
throat
though
it
was
feeling
very
sore
and
uncomfortable
there
was
a
row
of
pegs
on
the
passage
wall
just
inside
the
door
on
them
among
hats
caps
and
coats
and
also
saffron
gray
shawl
hung
two
long
comforters
that
the
keen
heath
winds
made
very
acceptable
on
a
walk
beaumaroy
took
them
and
tied
his
prisoner
hand
and
foot
he
had
just
completed
this
operation
in
the
workmanlike
fashion
which
he
had
learnt
on
service
when
he
heard
a
footstep
on
the
stairs
looking
up
he
saw
doctor
mary
standing
there
her
waiting
in
the
room
above
had
seemed
long
to
her
her
ears
had
been
expecting
the
sound
of
beaumaroy
tread
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
laden
with
his
burden
that
sound
had
not
come
instead
there
had
been
the
soft
just
audible
plop
of
the
sergeant
body
as
it
dropped
on
the
floor
of
the
passage
it
occurred
to
her
that
beaumaroy
had
perhaps
had
some
mishap
with
his
burden
or
found
difficulty
with
it
she
was
coming
downstairs
to
offer
her
help
seeing
what
she
saw
now
she
stood
still
in
surprise
beaumaroy
looked
up
at
her
and
smiled
no
cause
for
alarm
he
said
but
i
got
to
go
out
for
a
minute
keep
an
eye
on
this
rascal
will
you
oh
and
doctor
mary
if
he
tries
to
move
or
untie
himself
just
take
the
parlor
poker
and
hit
him
over
the
head
thanks
you
do
mind
de
you
and
you
sergeant
remember
what
i
said
with
these
words
beaumaroy
slipped
out
of
the
door
and
softly
closed
it
behind
him
chapter
xv
a
normal
case
when
captain
alec
brought
his
home
after
the
dinner
of
welcome
and
congratulation
at
old
place
it
was
nearly
twelve
jeanne
however
in
these
days
a
radiant
jeanne
very
different
from
the
mournful
creature
who
had
accompanied
captain
cranster
victim
to
inkston
a
few
weeks
before
was
sitting
up
for
her
mistress
and
since
she
had
to
perform
this
duty
which
was
sweetened
by
the
hope
of
receiving
exciting
confidences
for
surely
that
affair
was
marching
it
had
been
agreed
between
her
and
the
other
maids
that
she
should
sit
up
for
the
doctor
also
she
told
the
lovers
that
doctor
mary
had
been
called
for
by
beaumaroy
and
had
gone
out
with
him
presumably
to
visit
his
friend
saffron
it
did
not
occur
to
either
of
them
to
ask
when
mary
had
set
out
they
contented
themselves
with
exchanging
a
glance
of
disapproval
what
a
pity
that
mary
should
have
anything
more
to
do
with
this
saffron
and
his
beaumaroy
however
there
was
a
bright
side
to
it
this
time
it
would
be
kind
of
cynthia
to
sit
up
for
mary
and
minister
to
her
a
cup
of
tea
which
jeanne
should
prepare
and
it
would
be
pleasant
and
quite
permissible
for
captain
alec
to
bear
her
company
mary
could
not
be
long
surely
it
grew
late
so
for
a
while
they
thought
no
more
of
mary
as
was
natural
enough
they
had
so
much
to
talk
about
the
whole
of
a
new
and
very
wonderful
life
to
speculate
about
and
to
plan
the
whole
of
their
past
acquaintance
to
review
old
doubts
had
to
be
confessed
and
laughed
at
the
inevitability
of
the
whole
thing
from
the
first
beginnings
had
to
be
recognized
proved
and
exhibited
in
this
sweet
discourse
the
minutes
flew
by
unmarked
and
would
have
gone
on
flying
had
not
jeanne
reappeared
of
her
own
accord
to
remark
that
it
really
was
very
late
now
did
mademoiselle
think
that
possibly
anything
could
have
happened
to
doctor
arkroyd
by
jove
it
is
late
cried
the
captain
looking
at
his
watch
past
one
cynthia
was
amazed
to
hear
that
he
must
be
very
ill
that
old
gentleman
jeanne
opined
and
poor
doctor
arkroyd
will
be
very
tired
she
will
find
the
walk
across
the
heath
very
fatiguing
walk
jeanne
did
she
take
the
car
cried
cynthia
surprised
no
the
doctor
had
not
taken
the
car
she
had
started
to
walk
with
beaumaroy
the
parlormaid
had
certainly
told
jeanne
that
i
tell
you
what
said
the
captain
i
just
tool
along
to
tower
cottage
i
look
out
for
doctor
mary
on
the
road
and
give
her
a
lift
back
if
i
meet
her
if
i
do
i
can
stop
at
the
cottage
and
get
beaumaroy
to
tell
her
that
i
there
and
can
wait
to
bring
her
home
as
soon
as
she
ready
you
better
go
to
bed
cynthia
jeanne
tactfully
disappeared
and
the
lovers
said
after
alec
departure
jeanne
received
the
anticipated
confidence
that
departure
almost
synchronized
with
two
events
at
tower
cottage
the
first
was
beaumaroy
exit
from
the
front
door
leaving
mary
in
charge
of
his
prisoner
who
consequently
was
unable
to
keep
any
watch
on
the
road
or
to
warn
his
principals
of
approaching
danger
the
second
was
big
neddy
declaration
that
in
his
opinion
the
sack
now
held
about
as
much
as
he
could
carry
he
raised
it
from
the
floor
in
his
two
hands
must
weight
a
pound
or
more
he
reckoned
that
meant
a
lot
of
money
a
fat
lot
of
money
his
terrors
had
begun
to
wear
off
since
nothing
of
a
supernatural
or
even
creepy
order
had
actually
happened
he
had
at
last
even
agreed
to
the
candles
being
put
out
still
he
would
be
glad
to
be
off
enough
as
good
as
a
feast
as
the
sayin
goes
mike
he
chuckled
mike
had
fitted
a
new
battery
into
his
torch
it
shone
brightly
on
neddy
and
on
the
sack
whose
mouth
neddy
was
now
tying
up
i
might
fill
my
pockets
too
he
suggested
eyeing
the
very
respectable
amount
of
sovereigns
which
still
remained
in
captain
duggle
tomb
do
do
it
old
lad
neddy
advised
if
we
to
get
out
or
anything
of
that
kind
you
do
want
to
jingle
as
if
you
was
a
glass
chandelier
do
you
mike
admitted
the
cogency
of
the
objection
and
they
agreed
to
be
off
mike
started
for
the
window
i
just
pick
up
the
sergeant
he
said
and
signal
you
clear
then
you
follow
out
no
mike
said
neddy
slowly
but
very
decisively
if
you
do
mind
it
going
to
be
me
as
gets
out
of
that
window
first
i
ai
a
man
of
your
eddication
and
well
blast
me
if
i
going
to
be
left
in
this
place
alone
with
that
there
he
motioned
with
his
head
back
over
his
shoulder
towards
where
silent
saffron
sat
you
a
blooming
ass
neddy
but
have
it
your
own
way
only
let
me
see
the
coast
clear
first
he
stole
to
the
window
and
looked
around
he
assumed
that
the
sergeant
was
at
his
post
but
all
the
same
he
wanted
to
have
a
look
at
the
road
himself
so
he
had
and
the
result
was
satisfactory
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
he
should
scrutinize
the
ground
immediately
under
the
window
at
any
rate
he
did
not
think
of
that
it
was
as
beaumaroy
had
conjectured
from
another
direction
from
the
parlor
that
he
anticipated
a
possible
attack
there
all
was
quiet
he
came
back
and
reported
to
neddy
that
the
moment
was
favorable
i
switch
off
the
torch
though
just
in
case
you
can
feel
your
way
keep
to
the
edge
of
the
steps
knock
up
against
i
take
damned
good
care
not
to
muttered
neddy
with
a
little
shiver
he
made
his
way
to
the
window
through
the
darkness
having
slung
his
sack
over
his
shoulder
and
holding
it
with
his
right
hand
while
with
the
left
he
guided
himself
up
the
dais
and
along
its
outside
edge
giving
as
wide
a
berth
as
possible
to
the
great
chair
and
its
encircling
canopy
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
found
the
window
moved
the
sack
from
his
shoulder
and
set
it
on
the
ledge
for
a
moment
but
it
was
awkward
to
get
down
from
the
window
holding
that
heavy
sack
he
lowered
it
towards
the
ground
so
that
it
might
land
gently
and
just
as
he
let
it
go
he
turned
his
head
back
and
whispered
to
mike
all
serene
get
a
move
on
half
a
minute
answered
mike
as
he
in
his
turn
set
out
to
grope
his
way
to
the
window
but
he
was
not
so
cautious
as
his
friend
had
been
in
his
progress
he
kicked
the
tall
footstool
sharply
with
one
of
his
feet
neddy
leant
back
from
the
window
asking
quickly
and
again
very
nervously
what
the
devil
that
beaumaroy
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
thus
offered
to
him
he
was
crouching
on
the
ground
not
exactly
under
the
window
but
just
to
the
right
of
it
neddy
face
was
turned
away
he
threw
himself
on
to
the
bag
rose
to
his
feet
raised
it
cautiously
and
holding
it
in
front
of
him
with
both
his
hands
its
weight
was
fully
as
much
as
he
could
manage
was
round
the
curve
of
the
tower
and
out
of
sight
with
it
in
an
instant
at
the
back
of
the
house
there
was
a
space
of
ground
where
wiles
grew
a
few
vegetables
for
the
household
use
it
was
a
clearing
made
from
the
heath
but
it
was
not
enclosed
beaumaroy
was
able
to
reach
the
back
entrance
by
which
this
patch
of
ground
could
be
entered
from
the
kitchen
just
by
the
kitchen
door
stood
that
useful
thing
a
butt
for
rainwater
it
stood
some
three
or
feet
high
and
it
was
full
to
the
brim
almost
with
a
fresh
effort
beaumaroy
raised
the
sack
to
the
level
of
his
breast
then
he
lowered
it
into
the
water
not
dropping
it
for
fear
of
a
splash
but
immersing
both
his
arms
above
the
elbow
only
when
he
felt
the
weight
off
them
as
the
sack
touched
bottom
did
he
release
his
hold
then
with
cautious
steps
he
continued
his
progress
round
the
house
and
coming
to
the
other
side
crouched
close
by
the
wall
again
and
waited
where
he
was
now
he
could
see
the
fence
that
separated
the
front
garden
from
the
road
and
he
was
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
the
front
door
on
his
left
as
he
huddled
down
there
he
could
not
repress
a
smile
of
amusement
even
of
however
he
turned
to
the
practical
job
of
squeezing
the
water
out
of
his
sleeves
in
thus
congratulating
himself
he
was
premature
his
action
had
been
based
on
a
miscalculation
he
had
heard
only
neddy
last
exclamation
not
the
cautious
whispers
previously
exchanged
between
him
and
mike
he
thought
that
the
man
astride
the
himself
had
kicked
something
and
instinctively
exclaimed
what
the
devil
that
he
thought
that
the
sack
was
lowered
from
the
window
in
order
to
be
committed
to
the
temporary
guardianship
of
the
sergeant
who
was
doubtless
looking
out
for
it
and
if
he
had
his
ears
open
would
hear
its
gentle
thud
perhaps
the
man
in
the
tower
was
collecting
a
second
instalment
of
booty
heavy
as
the
sack
was
it
did
not
contain
all
that
he
knew
to
be
in
captain
duggle
grave
be
that
as
it
might
the
man
would
climb
out
of
the
window
soon
and
he
would
fail
to
find
his
sack
what
would
he
do
then
he
would
signal
or
call
to
the
sergeant
or
if
they
had
a
preconcerted
rendezvous
he
would
betake
himself
there
expecting
to
find
his
accomplice
he
would
neither
get
an
answer
from
him
nor
find
him
of
course
equally
of
course
he
would
look
for
him
but
the
last
place
where
he
would
expect
to
find
him
the
last
place
he
would
search
would
be
where
the
sergeant
in
fact
was
the
house
itself
if
in
his
search
for
hooper
he
found
beaumaroy
it
would
be
man
to
man
and
now
again
beaumaroy
had
no
objection
but
in
fact
there
were
two
men
in
the
tower
one
of
them
big
neddy
and
the
function
which
beaumaroy
supposed
to
have
been
intrusted
to
the
sergeant
had
never
been
assigned
to
him
at
all
to
guard
the
door
and
the
road
had
been
his
only
tasks
when
they
found
the
bag
gone
and
the
sergeant
too
they
might
well
think
that
the
sergeant
had
betrayed
them
that
he
had
gone
off
on
his
own
account
or
that
he
had
at
the
last
moment
under
an
impulse
of
fear
or
a
calculation
of
interest
changed
sides
and
joined
the
garrison
in
the
house
if
he
had
gone
off
with
the
sack
he
could
not
have
gone
fast
or
far
with
it
failing
to
overtake
him
they
might
turn
back
to
the
cottage
for
they
knew
themselves
to
be
in
superior
force
beaumaroy
was
in
greater
danger
than
he
knew
and
so
was
doctor
mary
in
the
house
big
neddy
let
himself
down
from
the
window
and
put
down
his
hand
to
lift
up
the
sack
he
groped
about
for
it
for
some
seconds
during
which
time
mike
also
climbed
over
the
and
dropped
on
to
the
ground
below
neddy
emitted
a
low
but
strenuous
oath
the
sack
gone
mike
he
added
in
a
whisper
gone
rot
ca
be
what
do
you
mean
neddy
i
dropped
it
straight
it
gone
neddy
persisted
the
sergeant
must
took
it
no
business
of
his
where
is
the
fool
mike
voice
was
already
uneasy
thieves
themselves
seldom
believe
in
there
being
honor
among
them
you
stay
here
i
go
to
the
door
and
see
if
he
there
he
was
just
about
to
put
this
purpose
into
execution
in
which
event
it
was
quite
likely
that
beaumaroy
hearing
his
approach
or
his
call
to
the
sergeant
would
have
sprung
out
upon
him
only
to
find
himself
assailed
the
next
instant
by
another
and
far
more
formidable
antagonist
in
the
person
of
big
neddy
and
thus
in
sore
peril
of
his
life
when
the
hum
of
captain
alec
engine
became
audible
in
the
distance
the
next
moment
the
lights
of
his
car
became
visible
to
all
the
men
in
the
little
front
garden
of
the
cottage
hist
wait
till
that
gone
by
whispered
neddy
yes
and
get
round
to
the
back
get
out
of
sight
round
here
he
drew
neddy
round
the
curve
of
the
tower
wall
till
his
big
frame
was
hidden
by
it
then
he
himself
crouched
down
under
the
wall
with
his
head
cautiously
protruded
the
night
had
grown
clearer
it
was
possible
to
see
figures
at
a
distance
of
some
yards
now
beaumaroy
also
perceived
the
car
whose
it
was
and
the
explanation
of
its
appearance
even
occurred
to
his
mind
but
he
kept
still
he
did
not
want
visitors
he
conceived
his
hand
to
be
a
better
one
than
it
really
was
and
preferred
to
play
it
by
himself
if
the
car
passed
by
well
and
good
only
if
it
stopped
at
the
gate
would
he
have
to
take
action
it
did
stop
at
the
gate
mike
saw
it
stop
then
its
engine
was
shut
off
and
a
man
got
out
of
it
and
came
up
to
the
garden
gate
though
the
watching
mike
had
never
seen
him
before
he
had
little
difficulty
in
guessing
who
he
was
and
he
remembered
something
that
the
sergeant
had
said
about
him
of
a
certainty
it
was
the
redoubtable
captain
naylor
through
the
darkness
he
loomed
enormous
as
tall
as
big
neddy
himself
and
no
whit
less
broad
a
powerful
reinforcement
for
the
garrison
and
what
would
the
sergeant
do
if
he
were
still
at
his
post
by
the
door
with
or
without
that
missing
that
sack
another
tall
figure
came
into
mike
view
from
where
he
could
not
distinctly
see
it
hardly
seemed
to
be
from
the
door
of
the
cottage
for
no
light
showed
and
there
was
no
sound
of
an
opening
door
but
it
appeared
from
somewhere
near
there
it
was
on
the
path
and
it
moved
along
to
the
gate
in
a
leisurely
unhurried
approach
a
man
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
that
was
what
it
looked
like
this
must
be
the
garrison
this
must
be
the
sergeant
friend
master
protector
and
his
boomery
but
the
sergeant
himself
where
was
he
he
could
hardly
be
at
his
post
or
beaumaroy
and
he
must
have
seen
one
another
must
have
taken
some
heed
of
one
another
something
must
have
passed
between
them
either
friendly
or
hostile
mike
turned
round
and
whispered
hastily
close
into
ear
neddy
crawled
a
little
forward
and
put
his
own
bullet
head
far
enough
round
the
curve
of
the
wall
to
see
the
meeting
between
the
garrison
and
its
unexpected
reinforcement
beaumaroy
hands
in
pockets
lounged
nonchalantly
down
to
the
gate
he
opened
it
the
captain
entered
the
two
shook
hands
and
stood
there
apparently
in
conversation
the
words
did
not
reach
the
ears
of
the
listeners
but
the
sound
of
voices
did
voices
hushed
in
tone
once
beaumaroy
pointed
to
the
house
both
mike
and
neddy
marked
the
outstretched
hand
was
beaumaroy
telling
his
companion
about
something
that
had
been
happening
at
the
house
were
they
concocting
a
plan
of
defense
or
of
attack
with
the
disappearance
perhaps
the
treachery
of
the
sergeant
and
the
appearance
of
this
new
ally
for
the
garrison
the
prospects
of
a
fight
took
on
a
very
different
look
neddy
might
tackle
the
big
stranger
with
an
equal
chance
how
would
mike
fare
in
an
encounter
with
beaumaroy
he
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
it
and
while
they
fought
the
traitor
sergeant
might
be
on
their
backs
or
on
the
other
hypothesis
he
might
be
getting
off
with
the
swag
neither
alternative
was
satisfactory
he
gone
off
to
the
car
with
the
sack
in
a
fright
like
thinking
we
guess
that
whispered
neddy
mike
did
not
much
think
so
though
he
would
much
have
liked
to
but
he
received
the
suggestion
kindly
we
might
as
well
have
a
look
we
can
come
back
afterwards
if
if
we
like
perhaps
that
big
have
gone
the
thing
as
i
want
to
do
most
is
to
wring
that
sergeant
neck
their
whispers
were
checked
by
a
new
development
the
cottage
door
opened
for
a
moment
and
then
closed
again
they
could
tell
that
both
by
the
sound
and
by
the
momentary
ray
of
light
yet
a
light
persisted
after
the
door
was
shut
it
came
from
a
candle
which
burnt
steadily
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
it
was
carried
by
a
woman
who
came
down
the
path
towards
where
beaumaroy
and
the
captain
stood
in
conversation
both
turned
towards
her
with
eager
attention
now
our
time
then
they
are
looking
our
way
now
we
can
get
across
the
heath
to
where
the
car
is
they
moved
off
very
softly
keeping
the
tower
between
them
and
the
group
on
the
path
they
gained
the
back
of
the
house
and
so
the
open
heath
and
made
off
to
their
destination
they
moved
so
softly
that
they
escaped
unheard
unless
beaumaroy
were
right
in
the
notion
that
his
ear
caught
a
little
rustle
of
the
bracken
he
took
no
heed
of
it
unless
a
passing
smile
might
be
reckoned
as
such
doctor
mary
joined
him
and
the
captain
on
the
path
beaumaroy
smile
gave
way
to
a
look
of
expectant
interest
he
wondered
what
she
was
going
to
say
to
captain
alec
there
was
so
much
that
she
might
say
or
just
conceivably
leave
unsaid
she
spoke
calmly
and
quietly
it
you
captain
alec
i
thought
so
cynthia
got
anxious
i
all
right
i
suppose
beaumaroy
has
told
you
poor
saffron
is
dead
i
told
him
said
beaumaroy
of
heart
disease
mary
added
quite
painlessly
i
think
and
quite
a
normal
case
though
of
course
it
distressing
i
i
sorry
stammered
captain
alec
beaumaroy
eyes
met
mary
in
the
candle
light
with
a
swift
glance
of
surprise
and
inquiry
chapter
xvi
dead
majesty
mary
did
not
appear
to
answer
beaumaroy
glance
she
continued
to
look
at
and
to
address
herself
to
captain
alec
i
am
tired
and
i
should
love
a
ride
home
but
i
still
a
little
to
do
and
i
know
it
awfully
late
but
would
you
mind
waiting
just
a
little
while
i
afraid
i
might
be
as
much
as
right
you
are
doctor
mary
as
long
as
you
like
i
walk
up
and
down
and
smoke
a
cigar
i
want
one
badly
mary
made
an
extremely
faint
motion
of
her
hand
towards
the
house
oh
thanks
but
really
i
well
i
shall
feel
more
comfortable
here
i
think
mary
smiled
it
was
always
safe
to
rely
on
captain
alec
fine
feelings
under
the
circumstances
he
would
she
had
felt
pretty
sure
prefer
to
smoke
his
cigar
outside
the
house
i
be
as
quick
as
i
can
come
mr
beaumaroy
beaumaroy
followed
her
up
the
path
and
into
the
house
the
sergeant
was
still
on
the
floor
of
the
passage
he
rolled
apprehensive
resentful
eyes
at
them
mary
took
no
heed
of
him
but
preceded
beaumaroy
into
the
parlor
and
shut
the
door
i
do
know
what
your
game
is
remarked
beaumaroy
in
a
low
voice
but
you
could
have
played
mine
better
i
do
want
him
inside
the
house
but
i
mighty
glad
to
have
him
extremely
visible
outside
it
it
was
very
quiet
inside
there
she
pointed
to
the
door
of
the
tower
just
before
i
came
out
before
that
i
heard
odd
sounds
was
there
somebody
there
and
the
sergeant
in
league
with
him
exactly
smiled
beaumaroy
it
is
all
quiet
i
think
i
have
a
look
the
candle
on
the
table
had
burnt
out
he
took
another
from
the
sideboard
and
lit
it
from
the
one
which
mary
still
held
like
the
poker
she
asked
with
a
flicker
of
a
smile
on
her
face
no
you
come
and
help
if
i
cry
out
he
could
not
repress
a
chuckle
doctor
mary
was
interesting
him
extremely
lighted
by
his
candle
he
went
into
the
tower
she
heard
him
moving
about
there
as
she
stood
thoughtfully
by
the
extinct
fire
still
with
her
candle
in
her
hand
beaumaroy
returned
he
gone
or
they
gone
he
exhibited
to
her
gaze
two
objects
a
checked
and
a
tobacco
pouch
number
one
found
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
number
two
on
the
floor
of
the
dais
just
behind
the
canopy
if
the
same
man
had
drawn
them
both
out
of
the
same
pocket
at
the
same
time
wanting
to
blow
the
same
nose
doctor
mary
they
have
fallen
at
the
same
place
would
they
wonderful
holmes
said
mary
and
now
shall
we
attend
to
mr
saffron
they
carried
out
that
office
the
course
of
which
they
had
originally
prepared
beaumaroy
passed
with
his
burden
hard
by
the
sergeant
and
mary
followed
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
came
downstairs
again
and
mary
again
led
the
way
into
the
parlor
she
went
to
the
window
and
drew
the
curtains
aside
a
little
way
the
lights
of
the
car
were
burning
the
captain
tall
figure
fell
within
their
rays
and
was
plainly
visible
strolling
up
and
down
the
ambit
of
the
rays
did
not
however
embrace
the
tower
window
the
captain
paced
and
smoked
patient
content
gone
back
to
his
own
happy
memories
and
anticipations
mary
returned
to
the
table
and
set
her
candle
down
on
it
all
right
i
think
we
can
keep
him
a
little
longer
i
vote
we
do
said
beaumaroy
i
reckon
he
scared
the
fellows
away
and
they
wo
come
back
so
long
as
they
see
his
lights
rash
at
conclusions
sometimes
as
has
been
seen
beaumaroy
was
right
in
his
opinion
of
the
captain
value
as
a
sentry
or
a
scarecrow
to
keep
away
hungry
birds
the
confederates
had
stolen
back
to
their
base
of
operations
to
where
their
car
lay
behind
the
trees
there
too
no
sergeant
and
no
sack
neddy
reached
for
his
roomy
flask
drank
of
it
and
with
hoarse
curses
consigned
the
entire
course
of
events
his
accomplices
even
himself
to
nethermost
perdition
that
place
ai
natural
he
ended
in
a
gloomy
conviction
pinched
that
sack
the
sergeant
well
maybe
it
was
and
maybe
it
was
he
finished
the
flask
to
cure
a
recurrence
of
the
shudders
mike
prevailed
with
him
so
far
that
he
consented
reluctantly
to
be
left
alone
on
the
blasted
heath
while
his
friend
went
back
to
reconnoiter
mike
went
and
presently
returned
the
car
was
still
there
the
tall
figure
was
still
pacing
up
and
down
and
perhaps
the
other
one
gone
for
the
police
mike
suggested
uneasily
guess
we
lost
the
hand
neddy
best
be
moving
eh
it
no
go
for
catch
me
trying
the
bloomin
place
any
other
night
grumbled
neddy
it
given
me
the
and
no
mistake
mike
percy
bennett
that
erstwhile
gentlemanly
stranger
recognized
one
of
his
failures
such
things
are
incidental
to
all
professions
our
best
game
is
to
go
back
if
the
sergeant
on
the
square
hear
from
him
but
he
spoke
without
much
hope
rationalist
as
he
professed
himself
still
he
was
affected
by
the
atmosphere
of
the
tower
with
what
difficulty
do
we
entirely
throw
off
atavistic
notions
they
both
of
them
had
at
the
bottom
of
their
minds
the
idea
that
the
dead
man
on
the
high
seat
had
defeated
them
and
that
no
luck
lay
in
meddling
with
his
treasure
i
my
doubts
whether
that
ugly
sergeant
himself
growled
neddy
as
he
hoisted
his
bulk
into
the
car
so
they
went
back
to
whence
they
came
and
the
impression
that
the
night
adventure
left
upon
them
was
heightened
as
the
days
went
by
for
strange
to
say
though
they
watched
all
the
usual
channels
of
information
as
ministers
say
in
parliament
and
also
tried
to
open
up
some
unusual
ones
they
never
heard
anything
again
of
the
sergeant
of
the
sack
of
gold
of
the
yawning
tomb
with
its
golden
lining
of
its
silent
enthroned
guardian
who
had
defeated
them
it
all
the
whole
bizarre
scene
vanished
from
their
ken
as
though
it
had
been
one
of
those
alluring
thwarting
dreams
which
afflict
men
in
sleep
it
was
an
experience
to
which
they
were
shy
of
alluding
among
their
confidential
friends
even
of
talking
about
between
themselves
in
a
word
uncomfortable
meanwhile
the
sergeant
association
with
tower
cottage
had
also
drawn
to
its
close
after
his
search
and
his
discovery
in
the
tower
beaumaroy
came
out
into
the
passage
where
the
prisoner
lay
and
proceeded
to
unfasten
his
bonds
stand
up
and
listen
to
me
sergeant
he
said
your
pals
have
run
away
they
ca
help
you
and
they
would
if
they
could
because
owing
to
you
they
have
got
away
with
any
plunder
and
so
they
be
in
a
very
bad
temper
with
you
in
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
is
captain
naylor
you
know
that
officer
and
his
dimensions
he
in
a
very
temper
with
you
too
here
beaumaroy
was
embroidering
the
situation
the
sergeant
was
not
really
in
captain
alec
thoughts
finally
i
in
a
very
bad
temper
with
you
myself
if
i
see
your
ugly
phiz
much
longer
i
may
break
out
do
you
think
you
better
depart
by
the
back
door
and
go
home
and
if
you
not
out
of
inkston
for
good
and
all
by
ten
in
the
morning
and
if
you
ever
show
yourself
there
again
look
out
for
squalls
what
you
got
out
of
this
business
i
do
know
you
can
keep
it
and
i
give
you
a
parting
present
myself
as
well
i
knows
a
thing
or
two
the
sergeant
began
but
he
saw
a
look
that
he
had
seen
only
once
or
twice
before
on
beaumaroy
face
on
each
occasion
it
had
been
followed
by
the
death
of
the
enemy
whose
act
had
elicited
it
oh
try
that
game
just
try
it
beaumaroy
muttered
just
give
me
that
excuse
he
advanced
to
the
sergeant
who
fell
suddenly
on
his
knees
do
make
a
noise
you
hound
or
i
silence
you
for
good
and
all
do
it
for
twopence
he
took
hold
of
the
sergeant
jerked
him
on
to
his
legs
and
propelled
him
to
the
kitchen
and
through
it
to
the
back
door
opening
it
he
dispatched
the
sergeant
through
the
doorway
with
an
accurate
and
vigorous
kick
he
fell
and
lay
sprawling
on
the
ground
for
a
second
then
gathered
himself
up
and
ran
hastily
over
the
heath
soon
disappearing
in
the
darkness
the
memory
of
beaumaroy
look
was
even
keener
than
the
sensation
caused
by
beaumaroy
boot
it
sent
him
in
flight
back
to
inkston
thence
to
london
thence
into
the
unknown
to
some
spot
chosen
for
its
remoteness
from
beaumaroy
from
captain
naylor
from
mike
and
from
neddy
he
recognized
his
unpopularity
thereby
achieving
a
triumph
in
a
difficult
little
branch
of
wisdom
beaumaroy
returned
to
the
parlor
hastily
not
so
much
to
avoid
keeping
captain
alec
waiting
it
was
quite
a
useful
precaution
to
have
that
sentry
on
duty
a
little
longer
as
because
his
curiosity
and
interest
had
been
excited
by
the
description
which
doctor
mary
had
given
of
saffron
death
it
was
true
probably
the
precise
truth
but
it
seemed
to
have
been
volunteered
in
a
rather
remarkable
way
and
worded
with
careful
purpose
also
it
was
the
bare
truth
the
truth
denuded
of
all
its
attendant
circumstances
which
had
not
been
normal
when
he
rejoined
her
mary
was
sitting
in
the
armchair
by
the
fire
she
heard
his
account
of
the
state
of
affairs
with
a
thoughtful
smile
smoking
a
cigarette
her
smile
broadened
over
the
tale
of
the
she
had
put
on
the
fur
cloak
in
which
she
had
walked
to
the
cottage
the
fire
was
out
and
the
room
cold
framed
in
the
furs
the
outline
of
her
face
looked
softer
so
we
stand
more
or
less
as
we
did
before
the
burglars
appeared
on
the
scene
she
commented
except
that
our
personal
exertions
have
saved
that
money
i
suppose
you
would
prefer
that
all
the
circumstances
should
come
out
there
have
been
irregularities
i
should
prefer
that
not
so
much
on
my
own
account
i
do
know
and
do
care
what
they
could
do
to
me
as
for
the
old
man
sake
if
i
know
you
i
think
you
would
rather
enjoy
being
able
to
keep
your
secret
you
like
having
the
laugh
of
people
i
know
that
myself
mr
beaumaroy
she
exchanged
a
smile
with
him
you
want
a
death
certificate
from
me
she
added
i
suppose
i
do
beaumaroy
agreed
in
the
sort
of
terms
in
which
i
described
saffron
death
to
captain
alec
if
i
gave
such
a
certificate
there
would
remain
nothing
well
nothing
peculiar
except
the
the
appearance
of
things
in
the
tower
her
eyes
were
now
fixed
on
his
face
he
nodded
his
head
with
a
smile
of
understanding
there
was
something
new
in
the
tone
of
doctor
voice
not
only
friendliness
though
that
was
there
but
a
note
of
excitement
of
enjoyment
as
though
she
also
were
not
superior
to
the
pleasure
of
having
the
laugh
of
people
but
it
rather
straining
a
point
to
say
that
and
nothing
more
i
could
do
it
only
if
you
made
me
feel
that
i
could
trust
you
absolutely
beaumaroy
made
a
little
grimace
and
waited
for
her
to
develop
her
subject
your
morality
is
different
from
most
people
and
from
mine
mine
is
conventional
conventual
beaumaroy
murmured
yours
is
it
all
personal
with
you
you
recognize
no
rights
in
people
whom
you
do
like
or
who
you
think
are
deserving
or
earned
rights
and
you
do
judge
your
own
rights
by
what
the
law
gives
you
either
the
right
of
conquest
you
called
it
you
hold
yourself
free
to
exercise
that
against
everybody
except
your
friends
and
against
everybody
in
the
interest
of
your
friends
like
poor
saffron
i
believe
you
do
the
same
for
me
if
i
asked
you
to
i
glad
you
believe
that
doctor
mary
but
i
ca
deal
with
you
on
that
basis
it
even
difficult
to
be
friends
on
that
basis
and
certainly
impossible
to
be
partners
i
never
suggested
that
we
should
be
partners
over
the
money
beaumaroy
put
in
quickly
no
but
i
suggesting
now
as
you
did
before
that
we
should
be
partners
in
a
secret
in
saffron
secret
she
smiled
again
as
she
added
you
can
manage
it
all
i
know
if
you
like
i
unlimited
confidence
in
your
ingenuity
quite
unlimited
but
none
at
all
in
my
honesty
you
got
an
honesty
but
i
do
call
it
a
really
honest
honesty
all
this
leads
up
to
the
radbolts
declared
beaumaroy
with
gesture
of
disgust
it
does
i
want
your
word
of
honor
given
to
a
friend
that
all
that
money
all
of
it
goes
to
the
radbolts
if
it
legally
belongs
to
them
i
want
that
in
exchange
for
the
certificate
a
hard
bargain
it
is
so
much
that
i
want
the
money
though
i
must
remark
that
in
my
judgment
i
have
a
strong
claim
to
it
i
would
say
a
moral
claim
but
for
my
deference
to
your
views
doctor
mary
but
it
mainly
that
i
hate
the
radbolts
getting
it
just
as
much
as
the
old
man
would
have
hated
it
i
have
given
you
my
my
terms
said
mary
beaumaroy
stood
looking
down
at
her
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
face
was
twisted
in
a
humorous
disgust
mary
laughed
gently
it
is
possible
to
to
keep
the
rules
without
being
a
prig
you
know
though
i
believe
you
think
it
is
including
the
sack
in
the
my
sack
the
sack
i
rescued
including
the
sack
in
the
yes
every
single
sovereign
though
mary
was
pursuing
the
high
moral
line
there
was
now
more
mischief
than
gravity
in
her
demeanor
well
i
do
it
he
evidently
spoke
with
a
great
effort
i
do
it
but
look
here
doctor
mary
you
live
to
be
sorry
you
made
me
do
it
oh
i
do
mean
that
that
conscience
of
yours
will
be
sorry
approve
no
doubt
being
the
extremely
conventionalized
thing
it
is
but
you
yourself
you
be
sorry
or
i
much
mistaken
in
the
radbolts
it
is
a
question
of
the
radbolts
she
insisted
laughing
oh
yes
it
is
and
you
come
to
feel
it
so
beaumaroy
was
equally
obstinate
mary
rose
then
that
settled
and
we
need
keep
captain
alec
waiting
any
longer
how
do
you
know
that
i
cheat
you
he
asked
i
do
know
how
i
know
that
mary
admitted
but
i
do
know
it
and
i
want
to
tell
you
she
suddenly
felt
embarrassed
under
his
gaze
her
cheeks
flushed
but
she
went
on
resolutely
to
tell
you
how
glad
how
happy
i
am
that
it
all
ends
like
this
that
the
poor
old
man
is
free
of
his
fancies
and
his
fears
beyond
both
our
pity
and
our
laughter
aye
he
earned
rest
if
there
is
to
be
rest
for
any
of
us
and
you
can
rest
too
and
you
can
laugh
with
us
and
not
at
us
that
after
all
a
more
human
sort
of
laughter
she
was
smiling
still
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
but
he
saw
that
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
the
next
instant
she
gave
a
little
sob
doctor
mary
he
exclaimed
in
rueful
expostulation
no
no
how
stupid
you
are
she
laughed
through
her
sob
it
not
unhappiness
she
pressed
his
hand
tightly
for
an
instant
and
then
walked
quickly
out
of
the
house
calling
back
to
him
do
come
please
come
i
rather
go
to
captain
alec
by
myself
left
alone
in
the
cottage
now
so
quiet
and
so
peaceful
beaumaroy
mused
a
while
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
then
he
turned
to
his
labors
his
final
night
of
work
in
the
tower
there
was
much
to
do
very
much
to
do
he
achieved
his
task
towards
morning
when
day
dawned
there
was
nothing
but
water
in
the
and
in
the
tower
no
furnishings
were
visible
save
three
chairs
a
high
carved
one
by
the
fireplace
and
two
much
smaller
on
the
little
platform
under
the
window
the
faded
old
red
carpet
on
the
floor
was
the
only
attempt
at
decoration
and
in
still
one
thing
more
the
tower
was
different
from
what
it
had
been
beaumaroy
contented
himself
with
pasting
brown
paper
over
the
pane
on
which
mike
had
operated
he
did
not
replace
the
matchboarding
over
the
window
but
stowed
it
away
in
the
the
place
was
horribly
in
need
of
sunshine
and
fresh
air
and
the
old
gentleman
was
no
longer
alive
to
fear
the
draught
when
the
undertaker
came
up
to
the
cottage
that
afternoon
he
glanced
from
the
parlor
through
the
open
door
into
the
tower
driving
past
on
business
sir
he
remarked
to
beaumaroy
i
often
wondered
what
the
old
gentleman
did
with
that
there
tower
but
it
looks
as
if
he
did
make
no
use
of
it
we
sometimes
stored
things
in
it
said
beaumaroy
but
as
you
see
there
nothing
much
there
now
but
then
the
undertaker
worthy
man
could
not
see
through
the
carpet
or
through
the
lid
of
captain
duggle
grave
that
was
full
fuller
than
it
had
been
at
any
period
of
its
history
in
it
lay
the
wealth
the
scepter
and
the
trappings
of
dead
majesty
for
wherein
did
saffron
dead
majesty
differ
from
the
dead
majesty
of
other
kings
chapter
xvii
the
chief
mourners
the
attendance
was
small
at
saffron
funeral
besides
meek
and
depressed
wiles
and
beaumaroy
himself
doctor
mary
found
herself
rather
to
her
surprise
in
company
with
old
naylor
on
comparing
notes
she
discovered
that
like
herself
he
had
come
on
urgent
invitation
and
moreover
that
he
was
engaged
also
to
come
on
afterwards
to
tower
cottage
where
beaumaroy
was
to
entertain
the
chief
mourners
at
a
repast
glad
enough
to
show
my
respect
to
a
neighbor
said
old
naylor
and
i
always
liked
the
old
man
looks
but
really
i
do
see
why
i
should
go
to
lunch
however
beaumaroy
mary
did
not
see
why
he
should
go
to
lunch
nor
for
that
matter
why
she
should
either
but
curiosity
about
the
chief
mourners
made
her
glad
that
she
was
going
the
chief
mourners
did
not
look
at
first
sight
attractive
radbolt
was
a
short
plump
man
with
a
weaselly
face
and
cunning
eyes
his
wife
eyes
of
a
greeny
color
stared
stolidly
out
from
her
broad
red
face
she
was
taller
than
her
mate
and
her
figure
contrived
to
be
at
once
stout
and
angular
all
through
the
service
beaumaroy
gaze
was
set
on
the
pair
as
they
sat
or
stood
in
front
of
him
wandering
from
the
one
to
the
other
in
an
apparently
fascinated
study
at
the
cottage
he
entertained
his
party
in
the
parlor
with
a
generous
hospitality
and
treated
the
radbolts
with
most
courteous
deference
the
man
responded
with
the
best
manners
that
he
had
who
can
do
more
the
woman
was
much
less
cordial
she
was
curt
and
treated
beaumaroy
rather
as
the
servant
than
the
friend
of
her
dead
cousin
there
was
a
clear
suggestion
of
suspicion
in
her
bearing
towards
him
after
a
broad
stare
of
astonishment
on
her
introduction
to
arkroyd
she
took
very
little
notice
of
mary
only
to
naylor
was
she
clumsily
civil
and
even
rather
cringing
it
was
clear
that
in
him
she
acknowledged
the
gentleman
he
sat
by
her
and
she
tried
to
insinuate
herself
into
a
private
conversation
with
him
apart
from
the
others
probing
him
as
to
his
knowledge
of
the
dead
man
and
his
mode
of
living
her
questions
hovered
persistently
round
the
point
of
saffron
expenditure
saffron
was
not
a
friend
of
mine
naylor
found
it
necessary
to
explain
i
had
few
opportunities
of
observing
his
way
of
life
even
if
i
had
felt
any
wish
to
do
so
i
suppose
beaumaroy
knew
all
about
his
affairs
she
suggested
as
to
that
i
think
you
must
ask
beaumaroy
himself
from
what
the
lawyers
say
the
old
man
seems
to
have
been
getting
rid
of
his
money
somehow
or
to
somebody
she
grumbled
in
a
positive
whisper
to
naylor
intense
relief
beaumaroy
interrupted
this
conversation
well
how
do
you
like
this
little
place
mrs
radbolt
he
asked
cheerfully
not
a
bad
little
crib
is
it
do
you
think
so
too
dr
arkroyd
throughout
this
gathering
beaumaroy
was
very
punctilious
with
his
dr
arkroyd
one
would
have
thought
that
mary
and
he
were
almost
strangers
yes
i
like
it
said
mary
the
tower
makes
it
rather
unusual
and
picturesque
this
was
not
really
her
sincere
opinion
she
was
playing
up
to
beaumaroy
convinced
that
he
had
opened
some
conversational
maneuver
do
like
it
at
all
answered
radbolt
we
get
rid
of
it
as
soon
as
we
can
wo
we
radbolt
she
always
addressed
her
husband
as
radbolt
do
be
in
a
hurry
do
throw
it
away
beaumaroy
advised
it
not
everybody
choice
of
course
but
there
are
quarters
yes
more
than
one
quarter
in
which
you
might
get
a
very
good
offer
for
this
place
his
eye
caught
mary
for
a
moment
indeed
i
wish
i
was
in
a
position
to
make
you
one
myself
i
should
like
to
take
it
as
it
stands
lock
stock
and
barrel
but
i
sunk
all
i
had
in
another
venture
hope
it
turns
out
a
satisfactory
one
so
i
not
in
a
position
to
do
it
if
radbolt
wants
to
sell
what
would
you
think
of
it
arkroyd
as
a
speculation
mary
shook
her
head
smiling
glad
to
be
able
to
smile
with
plausible
reason
i
not
as
fond
of
rash
speculations
as
you
are
mr
beaumaroy
it
may
be
worth
more
than
it
looks
he
pursued
good
neighborhood
healthy
air
fruitful
soil
very
rich
soil
hereabouts
my
dear
beaumaroy
the
land
about
here
is
abominable
naylor
expostulated
perhaps
generally
but
some
rich
pockets
one
may
call
pockets
corrected
beaumaroy
i
not
an
agriculturist
remarked
weaselly
radbolt
in
his
oily
tones
and
then
there
a
picturesque
old
yarn
told
about
it
oh
whether
true
or
not
of
course
i
do
know
it
about
a
certain
captain
duggle
not
the
army
the
mercantile
marine
radbolt
you
know
the
story
arkroyd
and
you
too
naylor
you
the
oldest
inhabitant
of
inkston
present
sir
suppose
you
tell
it
to
and
radbolt
sure
it
will
make
them
attach
a
new
value
to
this
really
very
attractive
cottage
with
as
arkroyd
says
the
additional
feature
of
the
tower
i
know
the
story
only
as
a
friend
of
mine
penrose
who
takes
great
interest
in
local
records
and
traditions
told
it
to
me
if
our
host
desires
i
shall
be
happy
to
tell
it
to
mrs
radbolt
naylor
accompanied
his
words
with
a
courtly
little
bow
to
that
lady
and
launched
upon
the
legend
of
captain
duggle
radbolt
was
a
religious
man
at
the
end
of
the
story
he
observed
gravely
the
belief
in
diabolical
personalities
is
not
to
be
lightly
dismissed
mr
beaumaroy
i
entirely
of
your
opinion
mr
radbolt
this
time
mary
felt
that
her
smile
was
not
so
plausible
there
seems
to
have
been
nothing
in
the
grave
mused
radbolt
apparently
not
when
captain
duggle
left
it
if
he
was
ever
in
it
at
all
events
not
when
he
left
the
house
in
whatever
way
and
by
whatever
agency
as
to
the
latter
point
i
myself
incline
to
penrose
theory
said
naylor
you
know
beaumaroy
puffed
at
his
cigar
still
i
often
thought
that
though
it
was
empty
then
it
would
have
made
supposing
it
really
exists
an
excellent
for
anybody
who
wanted
such
a
thing
say
for
a
miser
or
a
man
who
had
his
reasons
for
concealing
what
he
was
worth
i
once
suggested
the
idea
to
saffron
and
he
was
a
good
deal
amused
he
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
and
laughed
heartily
he
was
often
so
much
amused
as
that
a
new
look
came
into
radbolt
green
eyes
up
to
now
distrust
of
beaumaroy
had
predominated
his
frank
bearing
his
obvious
candor
and
simplicity
had
weakened
her
suspicions
but
his
words
suggested
something
else
he
might
be
a
fool
not
a
knave
saffron
had
been
amused
had
laughed
beyond
his
wont
that
might
have
seemed
the
best
way
of
putting
beaumaroy
off
the
scent
the
green
eyes
were
now
alert
eager
immensely
acquisitive
the
grave
in
the
tower
if
it
anywhere
would
you
like
to
see
the
tower
mrs
radbolt
yes
i
should
she
answered
tartly
being
part
of
our
property
as
it
is
mary
exchanged
a
glance
with
naylor
as
they
followed
the
others
into
the
tower
what
an
abominable
woman
her
glance
said
naylor
smiled
a
despairing
acquiescence
the
strangers
chief
mourners
owners
now
of
the
place
wherein
they
stood
looked
round
the
bare
brick
walls
of
the
little
rotunda
naylor
examined
it
with
interest
too
the
old
story
was
a
quaint
one
mary
stood
at
the
back
of
the
group
smiling
triumphantly
how
had
he
disposed
of
everything
she
had
not
been
wrong
in
her
unlimited
confidence
in
his
ingenuity
she
did
not
falter
in
her
faith
in
his
word
pledged
to
her
safe
from
burglars
that
grave
of
the
captain
if
you
kept
it
properly
concealed
beaumaroy
pursued
in
a
sort
of
humorous
meditation
and
in
these
days
some
people
like
to
have
their
money
in
their
own
hands
confiscatory
legislation
possible
is
it
naylor
you
know
about
those
things
better
than
i
do
and
then
the
taxes
shocking
radbolt
by
jove
i
knew
a
chap
the
other
day
who
came
in
for
what
sounded
like
a
pretty
little
inheritance
but
by
the
time
he
paid
all
the
duties
and
so
on
most
of
the
gilt
was
off
the
gingerbread
there
in
front
of
the
hearth
that
the
story
says
the
grave
is
it
mr
naylor
a
sudden
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
i
say
radbolt
would
you
like
us
to
have
a
look
whether
we
can
find
any
indications
of
it
his
eyes
traveled
beyond
the
lady
whom
he
addressed
they
met
mary
she
knew
their
message
he
was
taking
her
into
his
confidence
about
his
experiment
with
the
chief
mourners
the
stout
angular
woman
had
leapt
to
her
conclusion
much
less
money
than
had
been
expected
no
signs
of
money
having
been
spent
and
here
not
the
cunning
knave
whom
she
had
expected
but
a
garrulous
open
fool
giving
away
what
was
perhaps
a
golden
secret
mammon
the
greed
of
acquisitiveness
the
voracious
appetite
for
getting
more
gleamed
in
her
green
eyes
there
do
you
say
it
it
supposed
to
be
there
she
asked
eagerly
with
a
shake
in
her
voice
her
husband
interposed
in
a
suave
and
sanctimonious
voice
my
dear
if
beaumaroy
and
the
other
gentleman
wo
mind
my
saying
so
i
been
feeling
that
these
are
rather
light
and
frivolous
topics
for
the
day
and
the
occasion
which
brings
us
here
the
whole
thing
is
probably
an
unfounded
story
although
there
is
a
sound
moral
to
it
later
on
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
if
you
like
my
dear
but
cousin
aloysius
day
of
burial
is
it
quite
seemly
the
big
woman
looked
at
her
smaller
mate
for
just
a
moment
a
scrutinizing
look
then
she
said
with
most
unexpected
meekness
i
was
wrong
you
always
have
the
proper
feelings
radbolt
the
fault
was
mine
entirely
mine
beaumaroy
hastily
interposed
i
dragged
in
the
old
yarn
i
led
naylor
into
telling
it
i
told
you
about
what
i
said
to
saffron
and
how
he
took
it
all
my
fault
i
acknowledge
the
justice
of
your
rebuke
i
apologize
radbolt
and
i
think
that
we
exhausted
the
interest
of
the
tower
he
looked
at
his
watch
er
how
do
you
stand
for
time
shall
wiles
make
us
a
cup
of
tea
or
have
you
a
train
to
catch
that
the
woman
in
charge
of
the
house
is
it
asked
radbolt
comes
in
for
the
day
she
does
sleep
here
he
smiled
pleasantly
on
radbolt
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
think
that
she
would
consent
to
sleep
here
by
herself
silly
but
the
old
story
you
know
do
you
sleep
here
the
woman
persisted
though
her
husband
was
looking
at
her
rather
uneasily
up
to
now
i
have
said
beaumaroy
but
there
nothing
to
keep
me
here
now
and
naylor
has
kindly
offered
to
put
me
up
as
long
as
i
stay
at
inkston
going
to
leave
the
place
with
nobody
in
it
beaumaroy
manner
indicated
surprise
oh
yes
there
nothing
to
tempt
thieves
is
there
just
lock
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
the
woman
looked
very
surly
but
flummoxed
her
husband
with
his
suave
oiliness
came
to
her
rescue
my
wife
is
always
nervous
perhaps
foolishly
nervous
about
fire
beaumaroy
well
with
an
old
house
like
this
there
is
always
the
risk
upon
my
soul
i
had
thought
of
it
and
i
packed
up
all
my
things
and
your
car
come
and
fetched
them
naylor
still
of
course
i
could
oh
we
no
right
no
claim
to
trouble
you
beaumaroy
only
my
wife
is
fire
an
obsession
with
me
i
afraid
said
the
stout
woman
with
a
rumbling
giggle
the
sound
of
her
mirth
was
intolerably
disagreeable
to
mary
i
really
think
my
dear
that
you
feel
easier
if
i
stay
myself
wo
you
you
can
send
me
what
i
want
and
rejoin
me
when
we
arrange
because
we
shall
have
to
settle
what
to
be
done
with
the
place
as
you
please
mr
radbolt
beaumaroy
tone
was
for
the
first
time
a
little
curt
it
hinted
some
slight
offense
as
though
he
felt
himself
charged
with
carelessness
and
considered
radbolt
obsession
mere
fussiness
no
doubt
if
you
stay
wiles
will
agree
to
stay
too
and
do
her
best
to
make
you
comfortable
i
shall
feel
easier
that
way
radbolt
radbolt
admitted
with
another
rumble
of
apologetic
mirth
beaumaroy
motioned
his
guests
back
to
the
parlor
his
manner
retained
its
shade
of
distance
and
offense
then
it
really
only
remains
for
me
to
wish
you
and
all
happiness
in
your
new
property
any
information
in
my
possession
as
to
saffron
affairs
i
shall
of
course
be
happy
to
give
you
is
the
car
coming
for
you
mr
naylor
i
thought
it
would
be
pleasant
to
walk
back
and
i
hope
doctor
mary
will
come
with
us
and
have
some
tea
i
send
you
home
afterwards
doctor
mary
farewells
were
exchanged
but
now
without
even
a
show
of
cordiality
naylor
and
doctor
mary
felt
too
much
distaste
for
the
chief
mourners
to
attain
more
than
a
cold
civility
beaumaroy
did
not
relax
into
his
earlier
friendliness
his
apparent
dislike
to
her
husband
plan
of
staying
at
the
cottage
roused
radbolt
suspicions
again
was
he
a
rogue
after
all
but
a
very
plausible
a
very
deep
one
only
radbolt
unctuousness
surely
it
would
have
smoothed
the
stormiest
waves
saved
the
social
situation
intelligent
people
i
thought
beaumaroy
observed
as
the
three
friends
pursued
their
way
across
the
heath
towards
old
place
you
mr
naylor
old
naylor
grunted
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
beaumaroy
tried
doctor
mary
what
was
your
impression
of
them
oh
moaned
mary
with
a
deep
and
expressive
note
but
how
did
you
know
they
be
like
that
letters
and
the
old
man
description
he
had
a
considerable
command
of
language
and
very
violent
likes
and
dislikes
i
made
a
picture
of
them
and
it
turned
out
pretty
accurate
and
those
were
the
nearest
kith
and
kin
your
poor
old
man
had
naylor
shook
his
head
sadly
the
woman
obviously
cared
not
a
straw
about
anything
but
handling
his
money
and
could
even
hide
it
a
gross
and
horrible
female
beaumaroy
were
you
really
hurt
about
their
insisting
on
staying
asked
mary
oh
come
you
sharper
than
that
doctor
mary
still
i
think
i
did
it
pretty
well
i
set
the
old
girl
thinking
again
did
i
he
broke
into
laughter
and
mary
joined
in
heartily
old
naylor
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
air
of
curiosity
you
two
people
look
to
me
somehow
as
if
you
got
a
secret
between
you
perhaps
we
have
naylor
a
man
of
honor
doctor
mary
a
man
who
appreciates
a
situation
a
man
you
can
trust
beaumaroy
seemed
very
gay
and
happy
now
disembarrassed
of
a
load
and
buoyant
alike
in
walk
and
in
spirit
what
do
you
say
to
letting
naylor
just
him
nobody
else
into
our
secret
mary
put
her
arms
through
old
naylor
i
do
mind
if
you
do
but
nobody
else
then
you
shall
tell
him
the
entire
story
at
your
leisure
meanwhile
i
begin
at
the
wrong
end
i
told
you
i
made
a
picture
of
the
hated
cousins
of
the
those
sorrowing
chief
mourners
well
having
made
a
picture
of
them
that
proved
true
i
make
a
prophecy
about
them
and
i
bet
you
it
proves
just
as
true
go
on
said
mary
listen
naylor
she
added
with
a
squeeze
of
the
old
man
arm
you
like
a
couple
of
naughty
children
he
said
with
an
affectionate
look
and
laugh
well
my
prophecy
is
that
they
swear
the
poor
dear
old
man
estate
at
under
five
thousand
well
why
should
old
naylor
began
but
he
stopped
as
he
saw
mary
eyes
meet
beaumaroy
in
a
rapture
of
quick
and
delighted
understanding
and
then
perhaps
you
own
to
being
sorry
doctor
mary
so
that
what
you
were
up
to
was
it
said
mary
chapter
xviii
the
gold
and
the
treasure
old
naylor
called
on
mary
two
or
three
days
later
at
an
hour
when
as
he
well
knew
cynthia
was
at
his
own
house
in
order
to
hear
the
story
there
were
parts
of
it
which
she
could
not
describe
fully
for
lack
of
knowledge
the
enterprise
of
mike
and
big
neddy
for
example
but
all
that
she
knew
she
told
frankly
and
did
not
scruple
to
invoke
her
imagination
to
paint
beaumaroy
position
with
its
difficulties
demands
obligations
and
temptations
he
heard
her
with
close
attention
evidently
amused
and
watching
her
animated
face
with
a
keen
and
watchful
pleasure
surprising
he
said
at
the
end
rubbing
his
hands
together
that
to
say
not
in
itself
particularly
surprising
just
a
queer
little
happening
one
would
think
nothing
of
it
if
one
read
it
in
the
newspaper
things
are
always
so
much
more
surprising
when
they
happen
down
own
street
or
within
a
few
minutes
walk
of
one
garden
wall
and
when
one
actually
knows
the
people
involved
in
them
still
i
was
always
inclined
to
agree
with
irechester
that
there
was
something
out
of
the
common
about
old
saffron
and
our
friend
beaumaroy
irechester
never
found
out
what
it
was
though
exclaimed
mary
triumphantly
no
he
did
for
reasons
pretty
clearly
indicated
in
your
narrative
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
his
elbows
on
the
arms
and
his
hands
clasped
before
him
if
i
may
say
so
the
really
curious
thing
is
to
find
you
in
the
thick
of
it
doctor
mary
that
was
my
fault
i
could
refuse
to
attend
saffron
irechester
himself
said
so
he
paid
no
heed
to
her
protest
in
the
thick
of
it
and
enjoying
it
so
tremendously
mary
looked
thoughtful
i
did
at
first
i
was
angry
indignant
suspicious
i
thought
i
was
being
made
a
fool
of
so
you
were
a
fool
and
a
tool
my
dear
but
that
night
because
it
all
really
happened
in
just
one
night
the
chief
mourners
as
beaumaroy
always
calls
them
were
more
than
just
a
rather
amusing
epilogue
yes
that
all
that
night
it
did
get
hold
of
me
she
laughed
a
little
nervously
a
little
uneasily
and
now
you
tell
it
to
me
i
must
say
that
your
telling
made
it
twice
the
story
that
it
really
is
now
you
tell
it
as
if
it
were
the
greatest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
you
for
a
moment
mary
fenced
well
nothing
interesting
ever
has
happened
in
my
humdrum
life
before
but
old
naylor
pursed
up
his
lips
in
contempt
of
her
fencing
it
did
seem
to
me
a
great
a
great
experience
not
the
burglars
and
all
that
though
some
of
the
things
like
the
did
amuse
me
very
much
but
our
being
apart
from
all
the
world
there
by
ourselves
against
the
whole
world
in
a
way
mr
naylor
the
law
on
one
side
the
robbers
on
the
other
and
you
two
alone
together
yes
you
understand
that
was
the
way
i
felt
it
but
we
together
not
in
every
way
i
mean
we
were
fighting
between
ourselves
too
right
up
to
the
very
end
she
gave
another
low
laugh
i
suppose
we
fighting
still
he
means
to
face
me
with
some
radbolt
villainy
and
make
me
sorry
for
what
he
calls
my
legalism
with
an
epithet
that
his
idea
and
my
own
too
i
confess
those
chief
mourners
will
find
the
money
and
some
other
things
that
make
stare
but
lie
low
they
sit
on
the
cash
till
the
time
comes
when
it
safe
to
dispose
of
it
and
they
bilk
the
inland
revenue
out
of
the
duties
the
remarkable
thing
is
that
beaumaroy
seems
to
want
them
to
do
it
that
to
make
me
sorry
that
to
prove
me
wrong
mr
naylor
it
may
make
you
sorry
it
makes
me
sorry
for
that
matter
but
it
does
prove
you
wrong
you
were
right
my
boy
alec
would
have
taken
the
same
line
as
you
did
now
you
need
laugh
at
me
mary
i
own
up
at
once
that
my
highest
praise
i
know
it
is
and
it
implies
a
contrast
old
naylor
unclasped
his
hands
and
spread
them
in
a
deprecatory
gesture
it
must
do
that
he
acknowledged
mary
gave
a
rebellious
little
toss
of
her
head
i
do
care
if
it
does
naylor
beaumaroy
is
my
friend
now
and
mine
moreover
i
have
such
confidence
in
his
honor
and
fidelity
that
i
have
offered
him
a
rather
important
and
confidential
position
in
my
business
to
represent
us
at
one
of
the
foreign
ports
where
we
have
considerable
interests
he
smiled
it
the
sort
of
place
where
he
will
perhaps
find
himself
less
trammelled
by
er
legalism
and
with
more
opportunities
for
his
undoubted
gift
of
initiative
will
he
accept
your
offer
will
he
go
she
asked
rather
excitedly
without
doubt
i
think
it
really
quite
a
good
offer
and
what
prospects
has
he
now
or
here
mary
stretched
her
hands
towards
the
fire
and
gazed
into
it
in
silence
i
think
you
have
an
offer
soon
too
and
a
good
one
doctor
mary
irechester
was
over
at
our
place
yesterday
he
still
of
opinion
that
there
was
something
queer
at
tower
cottage
indeed
he
thinks
that
saffron
was
queer
himself
in
his
head
and
that
a
clever
doctor
would
have
found
it
out
that
he
himself
would
if
he
gone
on
attending
precisely
but
he
not
surprised
that
you
did
you
lacked
the
experience
still
he
thinks
none
the
worse
of
you
for
that
and
he
told
me
that
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
offer
you
partnership
irechester
a
bit
stiff
but
a
very
straight
fellow
you
could
rely
on
being
fairly
treated
and
it
a
good
practice
besides
he
well
off
and
quite
likely
to
retire
as
soon
as
he
sees
you
fairly
in
the
saddle
it
a
great
compliment
here
mary
voice
sounded
quite
straightforward
and
sincere
an
odd
little
note
of
contempt
crept
into
it
as
she
added
and
it
sounds
ideal
yes
it
does
old
naylor
agreed
with
a
private
smile
all
to
himself
whilst
mary
still
gazed
into
the
fire
quite
ideal
you
a
lucky
young
woman
mary
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
so
with
our
young
folk
happily
married
and
you
installed
and
friend
beaumaroy
suited
to
his
liking
why
upon
my
word
we
may
ring
the
curtain
down
on
a
happy
ending
of
act
i
at
all
events
she
seemed
to
pay
no
heed
to
his
words
he
stood
for
a
moment
admiring
her
not
as
a
beauty
but
a
healthy
comely
young
woman
and
with
humanity
and
a
sense
of
fun
in
her
and
as
he
looked
his
true
feeling
about
the
situation
suddenly
burst
through
all
restraint
and
leapt
from
his
lips
though
for
my
part
under
the
circumstances
if
i
were
you
i
see
old
irechester
damned
before
i
accepted
the
partnership
she
turned
to
him
startled
yet
suddenly
smiling
he
took
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
hush
not
another
word
my
dear
mary
the
next
day
as
mary
her
morning
round
finished
sat
at
lunch
with
cynthia
listening
or
not
listening
to
her
friend
excusably
eager
chatter
about
her
approaching
wedding
a
note
was
delivered
into
her
hands
the
are
in
a
hurry
she
back
the
window
is
boarded
up
again
come
and
see
about
this
afternoon
mary
kept
the
appointment
she
found
beaumaroy
strolling
up
and
down
on
the
road
in
front
of
the
cottage
the
tower
window
was
boarded
up
again
but
with
new
strong
planks
in
a
much
more
solid
and
workmanlike
fashion
if
he
were
to
try
again
mike
would
not
find
it
so
easy
to
negotiate
without
making
a
dangerous
noise
over
the
job
such
impatience
such
undisguised
rapacity
is
indecent
and
revolting
beaumaroy
remarked
he
seemed
to
be
in
the
highest
spirits
i
wonder
if
they
opened
it
yet
they
see
you
prowling
about
outside
wo
they
i
hope
so
indeed
i
no
doubt
of
it
greeneyes
is
probably
peering
through
the
parlor
window
at
this
minute
and
cursing
me
i
like
it
to
those
people
i
represent
law
and
order
if
they
can
rise
to
the
conception
of
such
a
thing
at
all
i
probably
embody
conscience
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
a
pleasant
turn
of
events
that
i
should
come
to
represent
law
and
order
and
conscience
to
anybody
even
to
the
radbolts
it
is
rather
a
change
she
agreed
but
let
walk
on
i
do
really
much
want
to
think
of
them
that
because
you
feel
that
you
losing
the
bet
i
ca
stop
them
getting
the
money
in
the
end
that
your
doing
i
ca
stop
them
cheating
the
revenue
which
is
what
they
certainly
mean
to
do
without
exposing
myself
to
more
inconvenience
than
i
am
disposed
to
undergo
in
the
cause
of
the
revenue
whereas
if
i
had
left
the
bag
in
the
all
your
doing
are
you
a
little
sorry
of
course
there
is
an
aspect
of
the
case
she
admitted
smiling
that
enough
for
me
you
lost
the
bet
let
see
what
were
the
stakes
mary
come
let
walk
on
she
put
her
arm
through
his
what
about
this
berth
that
naylor
offering
you
at
bogota
is
it
he
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
his
mind
worked
quickly
back
to
cynthia
almost
forgotten
tragedy
he
laughed
in
enjoyment
of
her
thrust
my
place
is
bogota
though
i
fancy
that
it
rather
in
the
same
moral
latitude
you
confusing
me
with
captain
cranster
so
i
was
for
a
moment
said
doctor
mary
demurely
but
what
about
the
appointment
anyhow
what
about
your
partnership
with
irechester
if
you
come
to
that
mary
pressed
his
arm
gently
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
little
while
they
were
clear
of
the
neighborhood
of
tower
cottage
now
but
still
a
considerable
distance
from
old
place
very
much
alone
together
on
the
heath
as
they
had
seemed
to
be
that
night
that
night
of
nights
at
the
cottage
i
have
so
much
as
received
the
offer
yet
only
naylor
has
mentioned
it
to
me
still
you
like
to
be
ready
with
your
answer
when
the
offer
is
made
would
you
he
drew
suddenly
away
from
her
and
stood
still
on
the
road
opposite
to
her
his
face
lost
its
playfulness
as
it
set
into
gravity
the
lines
upon
it
deepened
and
his
eyes
looked
rather
sad
this
is
wrong
of
me
perhaps
but
i
ca
help
it
i
not
going
to
talk
to
you
about
myself
confessions
and
apologies
and
excuses
and
so
on
are
in
my
line
i
should
probably
tell
lies
if
i
attempted
anything
of
the
sort
you
must
take
me
or
leave
me
on
your
own
judgment
on
your
own
feelings
about
me
as
you
seen
and
known
me
not
long
but
pretty
intimately
mary
he
suddenly
reached
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
combination
that
all
i
brought
away
of
his
from
tower
cottage
and
i
brought
it
away
as
much
for
your
sake
as
for
his
it
was
during
our
encounter
over
this
instrument
that
i
first
thought
of
you
as
a
woman
mary
and
by
jove
i
believe
you
knew
it
yes
i
believe
i
did
she
answered
her
eyes
set
very
steadily
on
his
he
slipped
the
thing
back
into
his
pocket
and
now
i
love
you
and
i
want
you
mary
she
fell
into
a
sudden
agitation
oh
but
this
does
seem
for
me
put
all
that
behind
me
i
she
could
scarcely
find
words
i
i
just
doctor
mary
lots
of
people
to
practice
on
bodies
and
souls
too
in
the
moral
latitude
i
going
to
her
body
seemed
to
shiver
a
little
as
though
before
a
plunge
into
deep
water
i
very
safe
here
she
whispered
yes
you
safe
here
he
acknowledged
gravely
and
stood
silent
waiting
for
her
choice
what
a
decision
to
have
to
make
she
cried
suddenly
it
all
my
life
in
a
moment
because
i
do
want
you
to
go
away
from
me
she
drew
near
to
him
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
i
not
a
child
like
cynthia
i
ca
dream
dreams
and
make
idols
any
more
i
think
i
see
you
as
you
are
and
i
do
know
whether
your
love
is
a
good
thing
she
paused
searching
his
eyes
with
hers
very
earnestly
then
she
went
on
but
if
it
is
i
think
there
no
good
thing
left
for
me
at
all
mary
is
that
your
answer
to
me
yes
her
arms
fell
from
his
shoulders
and
she
stood
opposite
to
him
in
silence
again
for
a
moment
then
her
troubled
face
cleared
to
a
calm
serenity
and
now
i
set
doubts
and
fears
behind
me
i
come
to
you
in
faith
and
loyalty
and
love
not
a
missionary
to
you
or
a
reformer
god
forbid
i
just
the
woman
who
loves
you
hector
i
should
have
mocked
at
the
missionary
and
tricked
the
reformer
he
bared
his
head
before
her
but
by
the
woman
who
loves
me
and
whom
i
love
i
will
deal
faithfully
he
bent
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
now
let
walk
on
no
not
to
old
place
back
home
past
tower
cottage
she
put
her
arm
through
his
again
and
they
set
out
through
the
soft
dusk
that
had
begun
to
hover
about
them
so
they
came
to
the
cottage
and
here
for
a
while
instinctively
stayed
their
steps
a
light
shone
in
the
parlor
window
the
tower
was
dark
and
still
mary
turned
her
face
to
beaumaroy
with
a
sudden
smile
of
scornful
gladness
aye
aye
you
right
his
smile
answered
hers
poor
devils
sorry
for
them
upon
my
soul
i
am
that
really
is
just
like
you
she
exclaimed
in
mirthful
exasperation
sorry
for
the
radbolts
now
are
you
well
after
all
they
only
got
the
gold
we
got
the
treasure
mary
the
end
