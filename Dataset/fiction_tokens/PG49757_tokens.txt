man
who

are
there
any
women
today
i
wonder
like
the
girl
wife
of
jacopone
da
todi
who
are
found
in
the
midst
of
worldly
brilliance
wearing
the
hair
shirt
of
piety
and
devotion
over
their
spotless
hearts
i
doubt
it
it
is
no
wonder
that
jacopone
that
smart
italian
lawyer
became
a
great
saint
when
he
made
that
discovery
after
his
beautiful
young
accidental
death
it
would
make
a
saint
of
anybody
i
am
quite
sure
gertrude
is
not
like
that
but
then
gertrude
is
not
my
yet
nor
am
i
jacopone
i
am
nothing
more
i
fear
than
a
contented
voluptuary
of
a
bookworm
like
king
james
i
feel
that
were
it
my
fate
to
be
a
captive
i
should
wish
to
be
shut
up
in
a
great
library
consuming
my
days
among
my
the
blessed
books
to
distil
the
reading
of
a
lifetime
into
a
little
wisdom
for
my
poor
wits
that
has
been
all
my
aim
and
my
ambition
if
by
any
name
so
dynamic
as
ambition
i
may
call
it
an
old
young
man
is
what
i
have
been
called
and
gertrude
seems
propelled
by
some
potent
urge
to
change
knows
why
i
have
just
been
talking
mean
listening
we
are
to
be
married
she
says
in
three
weeks
time
out
of
mind
we
have
been
friends
gertrude
and
i
as
our
mothers
had
been
before
us
she
the
highly
modern
spinster
and
i
such
as
i
am
have
been
linked
for
years
by
an
engagement
which
is
not
an
engagement
in
the
old
sense
at
all
it
is
a
sort
of
an
engagement
in
the
conventional
meaning
of
the
word
would
be
as
abhorrent
to
gertrude
as
the
marriage
as
soon
would
she
think
of
being
given
in
marriage
with
bell
book
and
orange
blossoms
as
of
calling
herself
randolph
byrd
anything
but
miss
bayard
that
is
what
we
have
been
discussing
this
gloomy
afternoon
in
my
snug
little
apartment
before
a
garrulous
fire
for
gertrude
is
not
so
absurd
as
to
hesitate
to
call
on
me
at
my
apartment
any
more
than
i
would
hesitate
to
call
on
her
in
gramercy
park
but
it
be
awkward
i
ventured
in
mild
speculation
if
after
we
are
married
we
have
to
stay
at
an
hotel
together
or
share
a
cabin
on
a
be
miss
bayard
and
mr
byrd
be
absurd
ranny
retorted
gertrude
with
her
usual
introductory
phrase
awkward
or
not
do
you
think
i
should
give
up
my
name
that
i
have
lived
under
all
my
life
fought
for
and
established
of
course
not
i
hastily
apologized
i
thought
of
that
i
could
not
help
wondering
what
she
meant
by
having
established
her
name
except
as
regards
one
or
two
committees
and
vacation
funds
name
is
unknown
to
celebrity
you
with
your
she
ran
on
briskly
with
the
triumph
of
having
scored
surely
you
want
to
cling
to
the
musty
old
formulas
no
certainly
not
i
answered
her
readily
i
am
no
match
for
gertrude
in
argument
of
a
sudden
i
became
aware
that
despite
the
hissing
fire
in
the
grate
there
was
no
sparkle
in
the
air
this
chill
november
afternoon
the
to
which
gertrude
had
alluded
was
the
only
thing
resembling
an
emotion
that
betrayed
any
sign
of
smoldering
life
within
me
in
that
discussion
of
ours
touching
matrimony
the
i
would
better
explain
stands
for
horror
of
my
profound
repugnance
toward
anything
resembling
the
fettering
bonds
of
domesticity
a
man
i
feel
should
be
as
free
to
do
what
he
pleases
and
to
go
where
he
likes
when
and
if
married
as
when
single
otherwise
who
would
assume
the
chains
and
slavery
of
that
shadowed
my
heart
suddenly
tells
me
i
must
be
off
upon
a
journey
of
unknown
duration
once
again
i
would
see
the
estraded
gardens
of
the
riviera
the
olive
groves
of
italy
the
sacred
parchments
and
incunabula
of
the
laurentian
library
in
florence
i
would
wander
anew
in
the
wilderness
of
the
bibliothèque
nationale
of
paris
and
on
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
where
once
i
collected
the
lore
of
balzac
and
of
and
who
dare
prevent
my
setting
off
at
a
notice
for
the
rotunda
of
the
british
museum
or
the
cloister
precincts
of
the
bodleian
at
oxford
even
as
gertrude
was
speaking
i
experienced
an
irresistible
longing
for
all
those
places
for
the
turf
walks
and
pleached
alleys
of
oxford
and
the
beautiful
backs
of
the
cambridge
colleges
there
is
a
manuscript
at
trinity
that
i
must
see
again
and
i
have
long
promised
myself
a
month
in
old
library
at
magdelene
in
cambridge
but
gertrude
is
not
like
other
women
what
i
like
about
you
ranny
she
remarked
flicking
the
ash
from
her
cigarette
with
unerring
aim
into
the
hearth
is
your
reasonableness
you
hate
as
i
do
to
see
two
people
handcuffed
together
like
a
pair
of
convicts
for
life
might
as
well
go
back
to
the
stone
age
or
to
the
times
of
a
dozen
children
in
the
house
and
the
mother
grilling
herself
all
day
before
the
kitchen
fire
ugh
and
she
gave
a
shudder
no
fear
of
that
with
you
i
laughed
no
i
should
hope
not
she
puffed
energetically
well
anyway
i
found
myself
reassuring
her
quickly
even
as
it
is
you
have
three
weeks
to
think
it
back
out
in
three
weeks
is
a
good
long
time
gertrude
much
can
happen
in
three
weeks
on
the
table
before
me
lay
a
new
life
of
leonardo
da
vinci
just
arrived
from
paris
that
day
my
fingers
itched
to
open
it
and
turn
the
pages
but
that
would
have
been
rude
so
i
forebore
i
am
not
like
that
gertrude
murmured
reflectively
and
you
know
it
ranny
of
course
not
i
guiltily
assented
i
know
she
tapped
my
cheek
with
a
playful
can
be
very
charming
if
she
thinks
of
i
know
perfectly
what
i
want
to
do
and
when
i
make
up
my
mind
to
do
a
thing
i
stick
to
it
and
so
she
does
the
clever
girl
i
wish
i
were
like
you
i
muttered
i
am
a
sort
of
drifter
afraid
why
you
need
a
manager
laughed
gertrude
wait
till
got
me
then
you
be
just
running
after
books
and
telling
yourself
what
going
to
do
some
day
be
doing
publishing
lecturing
be
oh
my
heavens
i
cried
out
in
a
terror
throwing
up
a
defensive
hand
i
think
run
away
too
late
she
smiled
with
a
cool
archness
when
gertrude
smiles
she
is
exceedingly
handsome
ordered
my
trousseau
you
leave
me
waiting
at
the
city
hall
would
you
i
might
i
answered
smiling
back
at
her
if
there
should
happen
to
be
a
book
auction
that
morning
and
only
a
subway
fare
back
to
your
flat
now
this
is
the
program
she
announced
assuming
her
magisterial
tone
which
instantaneously
reduces
me
to
a
spineless
worm
before
her
you
will
come
to
my
flat
on
the
at
ten
then
we
shall
drive
down
in
a
taxi
to
the
city
hall
and
get
the
whatever
they
call
lucky
be
there
i
could
not
help
murmuring
i
should
probably
get
a
dog
license
or
a
license
instead
of
the
correct
then
went
on
gertrude
very
properly
ignoring
me
we
can
have
the
alderman
of
the
day
sing
the
necessary
song
he
may
want
to
sing
an
kiss
the
bride
i
warned
her
he
want
to
kiss
me
when
i
look
at
him
answered
gertrude
imperturbably
nor
will
he
then
she
added
we
can
stop
here
at
your
place
and
pick
up
your
hand
luggage
and
mine
on
the
way
to
the
grand
central
station
you
can
send
your
trunk
the
day
before
and
send
mine
no
time
lost
you
see
no
waste
no
foolishness
perfect
efficiency
in
yes
said
gertrude
probably
forget
some
important
detail
in
the
arrangement
but
time
enough
to
drill
you
into
it
the
next
three
weeks
forget
i
repeated
somewhat
dazedly
i
admit
what
is
there
to
possibly
my
name
age
or
color
you
worry
flashed
gertrude
remember
those
for
you
need
them
i
meant
she
explained
about
your
trunk
or
railway
tickets
and
so
on
but
anyway
it
matter
remind
you
of
everything
the
day
before
i
promised
to
tie
a
knot
in
my
handkerchief
and
may
i
ask
i
ventured
where
we
are
going
i
decided
yet
gertrude
informed
me
let
you
know
later
ranny
dear
there
is
something
very
wholesome
and
complete
about
gertrude
that
is
the
reason
i
suppose
i
have
so
long
been
fond
of
her
how
she
can
put
up
with
a
dreamer
like
me
is
more
than
i
can
grasp
without
any
picturesque
or
romantic
significance
to
the
phrase
i
am
a
sort
of
beach
comber
sunning
myself
in
her
cloudless
energy
on
the
indolent
sands
of
life
every
one
either
tells
me
or
implies
that
gertrude
is
far
too
good
for
me
nor
do
i
doubt
it
but
i
wish
we
could
go
on
as
we
are
without
exposing
her
to
the
inconvenience
of
being
married
to
me
but
gertrude
knows
best
you
stay
and
share
my
humble
crust
this
evening
i
asked
her
as
she
rose
to
go
no
thanks
ranny
she
smiled
somewhat
enigmatically
i
thought
we
shall
often
dine
of
course
i
agreed
flippantly
we
may
even
meet
at
the
races
i
promised
said
gertrude
to
dine
at
the
club
with
stella
settle
some
committee
matters
before
i
go
away
shall
you
be
alone
poor
thing
that
matter
i
am
often
alone
i
prop
up
a
book
against
a
glass
candlestick
and
the
dinner
is
gone
before
i
am
aware
of
it
it
might
as
well
be
sawdust
for
all
you
know
laughed
gertrude
so
it
might
i
told
her
except
that
griselda
can
do
better
than
sawdust
i
might
of
course
i
added
call
up
dibdin
and
have
him
feast
with
me
your
trampy
friend
commented
gertrude
yes
better
do
it
i
like
to
think
of
you
so
much
alone
now
that
is
very
sweet
of
you
my
dear
do
exactly
that
her
cool
lips
touched
mine
for
an
instant
and
she
was
gone
to
my
shame
i
must
record
that
once
i
was
alone
the
appalling
fact
of
marriage
overwhelmed
me
like
a
landslide
with
a
sense
of
suffocation
and
wild
struggle
i
longed
to
do
in
earnest
what
i
had
threatened
to
do
in
jest
to
run
away
blindly
madly
anywhere
to
freedom
as
far
as
ever
i
could
go
when
i
should
have
been
rejoicing
i
desired
in
a
manner
to
sit
upon
the
ground
and
tell
sad
stories
of
the
death
of
kings
i
thought
upon
lincoln
a
brave
man
if
ever
one
there
was
who
had
paled
before
the
thought
of
marriage
and
wrote
consoling
letters
to
another
in
similar
case
when
i
ought
to
have
been
feeling
at
my
most
virile
i
felt
unmanned
yet
was
i
a
boy
to
be
a
prey
to
these
emotions
at
surely
a
man
should
know
his
own
mind
and
be
in
possession
of
himself
never
before
had
i
doubted
my
way
in
life
in
a
world
where
every
one
who
has
no
money
proceeds
with
energy
to
make
it
and
every
one
who
has
a
little
tirelessly
labors
to
acquire
more
i
had
wittingly
and
of
full
purpose
turned
my
life
away
from
the
market
place
and
toward
a
studious
devotion
to
books
on
my
compact
income
of
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
monthly
left
me
by
generous
parents
i
was
able
to
maintain
my
modest
apartment
in
twelfth
street
and
to
live
a
life
purposeless
in
the
eyes
of
some
no
doubt
but
which
to
me
is
priceless
that
slender
income
and
the
old
scotchwoman
griselda
dow
with
her
biblical
austerity
and
north
british
economy
surround
my
existence
with
the
comfort
of
a
cushion
because
two
sparrows
sold
for
one
farthing
was
to
griselda
a
reason
and
an
incentive
for
miracles
of
thrift
to
change
all
this
in
three
i
have
not
yet
informed
griselda
in
a
welter
of
agitation
i
began
to
pace
the
room
perhaps
i
am
a
fool
to
harbor
such
emotions
but
i
confess
that
the
sight
of
my
pleasant
study
covered
to
the
ceiling
with
the
books
that
i
love
and
so
many
of
which
i
have
gathered
fills
me
with
a
poignant
melancholy
to
uproot
all
this
or
to
change
it
violently
seems
like
a
sin
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
commit
how
had
i
come
to
think
of
committing
it
gertrude
is
of
course
a
splendid
girl
with
all
her
energy
she
can
yet
sympathize
with
the
mild
successes
of
a
poor
bookworm
and
listen
with
patience
to
the
tales
of
his
triumphs
as
though
he
had
captured
an
army
corps
my
first
edition
of
the
religio
medici
can
mean
nothing
to
her
who
has
never
read
it
but
she
seemed
gladdened
by
my
victory
when
i
acquired
it
under
the
very
nose
of
a
wily
bookseller
when
was
it
that
i
had
first
asked
gertrude
to
marry
me
it
is
odd
that
i
can
not
remember
for
our
friendship
could
have
continued
on
the
same
pleasant
basis
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
i
was
dining
alone
with
her
one
evening
at
her
apartment
in
gramercy
park
i
remember
and
there
was
sparkling
moselle
i
am
not
one
of
your
experienced
topers
and
that
sparkling
moselle
entered
my
blood
like
a
caxton
in
a
zaehnsdorf
binding
or
a
first
folio
of
shakespeare
a
golden
haze
had
seemed
to
emanate
from
every
object
in
the
region
of
that
moselle
then
i
recollect
gertrude
and
i
were
on
a
new
plane
of
being
we
were
speaking
of
marriage
without
being
engaged
we
were
in
phrase
talking
of
marrying
each
other
it
was
on
that
evening
i
must
have
asked
her
though
oddly
enough
i
have
no
recollection
of
the
fact
and
now
it
seems
three
pleasant
years
have
passed
and
the
time
has
come
again
it
occurred
to
me
abruptly
that
i
had
not
yet
informed
griselda
what
if
gertrude
should
insist
upon
my
removing
myself
to
her
apartment
would
she
accept
griselda
and
how
would
my
precious
books
be
domiciled
how
human
they
are
those
books
even
though
silent
always
i
have
found
them
waiting
whenever
i
returned
from
journeys
from
summer
visits
from
the
country
from
anywhere
their
backs
and
bindings
seem
to
shimmer
and
flash
forth
a
stately
greeting
to
exhale
that
subtle
fragrance
of
leather
ink
and
paper
that
none
but
know
they
have
developed
a
sense
in
me
to
perceive
these
things
as
no
one
else
can
perceive
them
how
delightful
it
has
been
to
find
them
in
their
peaceful
legions
arrayed
and
changeless
retaining
the
very
marks
and
slips
i
have
left
in
them
faithful
servitors
and
friends
i
take
down
the
antigone
in
the
cambridge
sophocles
that
faces
me
as
i
stand
and
open
at
random
to
the
chorus
love
invincible
love
who
makest
havoc
of
wealth
who
keepest
vigil
on
the
soft
cheek
of
the
maiden
immortal
can
escape
thee
nor
any
among
men
whose
life
is
for
a
day
and
he
to
whom
thou
hast
come
is
mad
it
is
clear
that
sophocles
was
no
modern
ah
me
i
must
tell
griselda
at
once
lest
her
scotch
probity
should
charge
me
with
disingenuousness
or
evasion
i
pressed
a
bell
i
could
not
face
griselda
in
the
kitchen
which
is
her
stronghold
i
must
summon
her
to
mine
griselda
with
a
cap
awry
on
her
coarse
gray
hair
appeared
at
the
door
you
called
she
demanded
yes
griselda
i
called
come
in
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
griselda
has
known
me
since
i
was
seven
and
all
my
gravity
counts
for
ever
so
little
with
her
so
redolent
is
she
of
rich
encrusted
personality
that
she
gives
to
my
poor
small
apartment
the
air
of
an
establishment
you
always
call
me
randolph
she
somewhat
testily
informed
me
just
when
i
have
my
hands
in
the
dough
pan
or
when
the
pot
is
boiling
over
which
is
it
now
i
asked
her
laughing
somewhat
ruefully
both
was
her
laconic
answer
hurry
back
then
i
told
her
what
i
wanted
to
say
will
keep
just
like
a
man
muttered
griselda
and
left
me
without
ceremony
the
relief
i
felt
was
shameful
to
face
griselda
with
news
of
a
possible
derangement
of
our
lives
required
a
courage
a
girding
up
of
resolution
to
which
at
the
moment
i
felt
myself
woefully
unequal
there
was
dibdin
and
his
blessed
archeological
expedition
he
had
told
me
that
there
might
be
a
berth
for
me
as
a
sort
of
keeper
of
records
and
archives
if
only
he
had
started
last
week
in
a
mist
of
vision
well
known
to
daydreamers
i
suddenly
saw
the
trim
shipshape
steamer
with
holystoned
decks
the
glinting
metal
work
the
opulent
sun
pouring
down
on
lightly
clad
passengers
lounging
in
deck
chairs
girls
in
white
lazily
flirting
with
indolent
men
what
oceans
of
joy
and
ease
were
to
be
found
in
the
world
for
those
who
knew
how
to
take
them
ah
well
gertrude
would
make
no
opposition
to
my
going
since
absolute
individual
liberty
is
the
very
keystone
in
the
arch
of
our
coming
marriage
i
decided
to
ring
up
dibdin
our
line
is
out
of
order
the
switchboard
below
informed
me
have
a
man
up
here
as
soon
as
possible
frustration
i
did
not
wish
the
colored
door
boy
below
to
hear
what
i
said
he
has
a
notion
of
my
dignity
with
a
restless
agitation
new
to
me
i
again
fell
to
pacing
the
room
a
room
not
contrived
for
exercise
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
must
go
to
see
my
sister
my
only
near
relative
she
was
sure
to
be
at
home
for
she
poor
girl
is
always
at
home
with
her
three
children
and
her
broken
health
if
it
were
not
that
the
damnable
telephone
is
out
of
order
i
would
ring
her
up
immediately
what
with
her
three
young
children
and
an
income
the
exact
equivalent
of
my
own
she
has
little
diversion
unless
i
take
her
to
the
theater
or
the
opera
how
does
the
poor
girl
manage
i
wonder
i
dread
to
ask
her
and
she
never
complains
i
ought
to
see
her
oftener
if
only
she
lived
nearer
than
the
depths
of
brooklyn
there
is
the
result
of
romantic
marriage
for
you
poor
laura
committed
the
error
of
falling
in
love
with
a
man
on
a
steamer
when
she
was
barely
nineteen
and
marrying
him
secretly
after
seven
years
and
three
babies
the
scoundrel
pendleton
with
his
smooth
ways
and
unsteady
eye
deserted
her
disappeared
into
the
blue
the
poor
health
has
never
been
good
since
then
it
is
irritating
to
think
that
i
might
have
done
more
than
an
occasional
gift
for
laura
and
the
children
but
i
am
so
wretchedly
poor
myself
i
still
can
not
comprehend
how
laura
could
have
been
so
inconceivably
foolish
as
to
marry
that
ruffian
pendleton
before
she
had
known
him
three
then
to
acquire
three
babies
gertrude
at
all
events
could
not
be
guilty
of
anything
so
perverse
sordid
it
all
is
and
how
disturbing
good
enough
perhaps
for
the
hopeless
middle
class
types
who
have
nothing
else
to
expect
of
life
or
to
absorb
them
but
for
folk
with
ambitions
and
ideals
what
are
my
ambitions
and
ideals
i
can
not
at
times
help
wondering
useless
to
analyze
freedom
to
have
them
is
the
first
of
all
how
eager
i
used
to
be
to
discuss
them
with
laura
during
those
long
summers
at
our
cottage
in
westchester
when
life
seemed
endless
and
the
future
infinite
between
sets
at
tennis
i
poured
out
to
her
the
things
i
was
going
to
do
in
the
world
laura
is
only
two
years
older
than
i
but
how
well
she
had
understood
and
how
sympathetic
she
was
it
was
the
motherhood
within
her
i
suppose
that
drove
her
to
the
marriage
and
the
kiddies
the
scent
of
those
summers
comes
to
my
nostrils
now
the
fragrance
of
lilac
and
honeysuckle
that
brought
ideas
to
head
dreams
of
achievement
of
perfection
and
happiness
who
has
that
cottage
now
i
wonder
poor
dreams
have
been
distorted
into
a
very
dismal
sort
of
reality
and
what
of
my
own
but
here
is
griselda
and
she
is
announcing
dibdin
that
grizzled
priest
of
what
he
is
pleased
to
call
science
growled
in
a
way
he
meant
to
be
pleasant
as
he
shouldered
into
my
comfortable
study
and
sank
sprawling
into
my
best
chair
he
never
seems
quite
at
home
in
a
civilized
room
get
you
on
the
telephone
he
remarked
thought
drop
over
and
see
what
iniquities
up
to
as
you
see
i
told
him
deep
in
crime
will
you
feed
me
he
demanded
with
a
gruffness
that
is
part
of
his
charm
certainly
what
else
can
i
do
when
you
come
at
this
hour
all
right
then
listen
to
you
he
said
but
how
i
wondered
do
you
know
i
want
to
say
anything
you
look
charged
to
the
nozzle
he
answered
elegantly
what
is
rare
edition
of
somebody
or
other
amazing
devil
dibdin
i
always
resent
his
ability
to
read
me
in
this
manner
but
he
tells
me
that
in
his
archeological
expeditions
he
has
had
so
often
to
watch
faces
of
indians
chinese
negroes
turks
and
others
whose
language
he
did
not
speak
that
to
see
the
desires
of
men
in
their
eyes
amounts
with
him
to
an
added
sense
well
if
you
must
know
i
sat
down
facing
him
i
am
nonplussed
baffled
perplexed
at
sea
on
the
horns
of
a
of
those
things
i
am
to
be
married
in
three
weeks
eager
swain
was
his
only
comment
is
that
all
you
can
say
well
feeling
about
it
the
way
you
seem
to
feel
i
might
add
that
a
damn
fool
tell
me
something
novel
i
retorted
irritably
he
said
the
only
thing
i
know
comprehensive
i
sneered
complete
was
his
succinct
rejoinder
what
a
comfort
you
are
i
cried
with
a
harassed
laugh
what
the
devil
made
you
get
into
it
he
growled
fate
i
told
him
a
poor
fate
that
work
both
ways
he
observed
i
suppose
i
sound
to
you
like
either
a
brute
or
a
cad
or
both
i
pursued
but
the
fact
is
dibdin
i
am
not
a
marrying
man
the
girl
in
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
an
admirable
a
splendid
girl
far
too
good
for
the
likes
of
me
but
i
simply
hate
the
thought
of
owing
duties
to
anybody
i
want
to
be
free
to
do
absolutely
as
i
please
to
go
off
with
you
to
the
solomon
islands
or
china
or
popocatepetl
if
i
want
to
or
to
run
after
some
first
edition
if
i
feel
inclined
in
short
i
want
to
bother
about
wives
or
children
or
whooping
cough
or
measles
or
have
them
bother
about
me
would
you
call
that
selfish
damnably
said
dibdin
without
emotion
well
then
that
is
what
i
am
i
retorted
warmly
and
it
is
no
use
trying
to
change
it
takes
myriad
kinds
to
make
a
world
i
am
one
kind
no
said
dibdin
gravely
think
some
other
kind
this
eternal
beautiful
boundless
freedom
i
went
on
ignoring
surely
it
is
good
that
some
mortals
should
have
it
i
am
losing
it
three
weeks
off
did
you
obsequies
he
queried
yes
i
answered
sadly
then
maybe
it
happen
he
remarked
to
the
ceiling
what
makes
you
say
that
i
caught
him
up
know
he
replied
in
his
carefully
lazy
tone
that
he
assumed
when
he
wished
to
sound
oracular
just
a
you
deserve
something
a
good
than
marriage
then
abruptly
sitting
up
in
his
chair
and
pulling
a
thin
volume
out
of
his
pocket
look
at
this
he
muttered
i
took
the
book
and
opened
it
an
elzevir
i
exclaimed
where
did
you
get
it
all
the
rest
of
the
world
and
all
my
cares
thinned
to
insignificance
before
this
treasure
a
plutocratic
book
collector
living
in
a
mausoleum
on
fifth
avenue
has
just
given
it
to
me
he
replied
a
duplicate
he
has
another
and
a
better
one
of
the
same
date
value
it
any
at
all
value
it
i
cried
as
my
fingers
caressed
it
why
certainly
i
value
it
it
is
a
perfectly
genuine
great
louis
himself
printed
this
at
leyden
it
is
not
what
you
would
call
a
tall
copy
and
binders
have
sacrilegiously
spoiled
an
originally
fine
broad
margin
not
perfect
but
a
splendid
specimen
of
early
printing
with
title
page
and
colophon
intact
a
beauty
you
beat
the
devil
murmured
dibdin
in
his
beard
you
can
be
enthusiastic
about
some
things
clear
anyway
the
book
is
yours
he
concluded
i
have
no
use
for
it
you
mean
it
i
exulted
incredulously
i
am
simply
delighted
dibdin
tickled
pink
as
you
would
say
i
have
long
wanted
the
elzevir
i
a
single
elzevir
to
compare
with
this
think
of
this
coming
out
of
the
blue
and
in
my
foolish
way
i
fell
to
gloating
over
the
thin
musty
little
volume
examining
the
worm
drills
holding
it
up
to
the
light
for
watermarks
in
the
gray
paper
and
in
general
i
suppose
behaving
like
an
imbecile
illustrates
my
point
muttered
dibdin
fumbling
with
a
malodorous
corn
cob
and
a
tobacco
pouch
point
what
point
i
looked
up
at
him
abstractedly
out
of
the
book
you
say
you
yearned
may
happen
and
you
call
yourself
a
scientist
i
marveled
leaning
back
in
the
chair
things
like
this
but
in
the
serious
business
of
life
ground
between
the
millstones
of
the
victim
of
events
you
can
not
control
look
at
rabelais
and
montaigne
two
free
spirits
if
ever
there
were
any
yet
one
was
a
victim
of
priestcraft
so
that
he
cried
out
until
he
roared
with
orgiastic
laughter
and
the
other
a
victim
of
property
a
wife
that
disgusted
him
i
have
beautiful
editions
of
both
of
them
by
the
way
which
you
ought
to
look
at
but
each
of
them
was
a
victim
a
victim
if
victimized
dibdin
puffed
at
his
foul
pipe
i
can
not
make
him
smoke
a
decent
cigarette
but
if
you
know
how
to
play
with
circumstances
you
use
them
as
i
saw
a
cowboy
in
arizona
ride
a
bucking
broncho
you
ride
them
till
you
break
them
look
at
me
my
boy
he
went
on
with
a
grin
of
mingled
modesty
and
bravado
i
knew
i
was
a
tramp
at
heart
but
my
people
would
have
been
broken
with
humiliation
if
i
had
turned
out
a
on
their
hands
so
i
took
to
ruins
and
buried
cities
in
places
and
politely
speaking
an
archeologist
but
i
tramp
about
the
world
to
my
content
that
i
admit
presented
dibdin
and
the
whole
matter
in
a
new
light
to
me
why
i
finally
asked
i
do
that
because
not
a
tramp
at
heart
puffed
dibdin
yes
i
am
i
almost
shouted
at
him
that
is
exactly
what
i
must
be
since
i
have
such
a
horror
of
home
of
domesticity
you
with
all
this
flat
a
housekeeper
all
the
truck
in
this
room
no
no
my
boy
cast
for
something
else
hanged
if
i
know
for
what
though
these
things
are
too
deep
to
generalize
about
time
will
tell
i
rose
and
circled
the
room
inanely
surveying
this
comfort
that
seems
to
offend
dibdin
though
he
likes
well
enough
to
sprawl
in
my
best
the
books
the
rugs
the
fire
the
alluring
chairs
the
happy
hours
that
i
have
spent
here
seemed
to
crowd
about
me
like
the
ghosts
of
familiars
praying
to
be
not
driven
from
their
haunts
then
why
the
devil
i
demanded
accusingly
pausing
before
him
did
you
encourage
me
and
praise
my
little
papers
and
bits
of
work
in
college
when
you
were
teaching
me
trying
to
teach
you
he
corrected
placidly
never
been
a
teacher
in
a
large
fashionable
college
my
boy
when
most
of
your
students
are
taking
your
course
because
it
is
reported
to
be
a
snap
so
they
can
spend
their
evenings
at
billiards
musical
comedies
or
the
like
any
young
devil
with
a
ray
of
intellectual
interest
becomes
the
boy
even
teachers
are
human
admit
you
set
even
so
much
as
your
own
on
fire
as
yet
all
that
is
beside
the
point
i
returned
irritably
here
i
am
in
the
devil
of
a
fix
and
you
are
talking
like
comforters
yes
he
agreed
i
suppose
i
am
but
in
the
end
it
was
not
the
comforters
but
events
that
pulled
job
up
await
events
with
resignation
and
expectancy
randolph
my
lad
and
play
the
game
stake
your
coin
and
wait
until
the
wheel
stops
and
see
what
happens
a
fine
teacher
you
are
i
laughed
at
him
albeit
mirthlessly
no
good
at
all
he
assented
cheerfully
knocking
his
pipe
against
the
ash
tray
and
pocketing
the
noisome
thing
and
i
chuck
teaching
the
minute
events
made
it
possible
events
my
boy
they
are
the
teacher
and
the
deities
to
tie
to
set
up
a
little
altar
to
the
great
god
here
in
your
perfumed
little
temple
what
i
should
do
he
concluded
muttering
into
his
beard
incidentally
he
added
getting
extraordinarily
hungry
oh
sorry
i
murmured
glad
here
to
eat
with
me
anyway
it
enables
me
to
put
off
breaking
the
news
of
my
coming
marriage
to
griselda
told
her
yet
shouted
dibdin
sitting
up
in
his
chair
that
fine
upright
highland
lassie
then
no
disciple
of
mine
face
things
with
courage
and
face
fairly
randolph
go
and
tell
her
now
wait
here
with
my
highly
moral
support
i
blurted
miserably
yes
you
can
he
insisted
with
obstinacy
go
and
do
it
now
with
a
gesture
of
desperation
i
pressed
the
bell
if
i
am
going
to
tell
her
anything
i
mumbled
between
my
teeth
say
it
right
here
dibdin
laughed
ghoulishly
this
shrinking
from
life
he
philosophized
what
our
kind
of
education
brings
about
griselda
appeared
at
the
door
you
rang
mr
randolph
griselda
and
i
felt
myself
idiotically
hot
and
flushed
i
wanted
to
and
beads
of
perspiration
prickled
my
forehead
then
in
desperation
i
stammered
out
dibdin
is
dining
here
all
griselda
laugh
rattled
throatily
in
the
room
how
i
hated
him
at
that
moment
griselda
swept
us
with
an
impenetrable
glance
there
is
a
place
laid
for
him
she
uttered
in
the
tone
of
one
whose
patience
is
a
sternly
acquired
virtue
and
she
left
us
better
strip
my
lad
chuckled
dibdin
and
put
on
your
wrestling
trunks
what
mean
i
demanded
sulkily
the
tussle
that
life
is
going
to
give
you
will
be
a
caution
a
lot
you
know
about
life
not
much
a
fact
dibdin
observed
more
soberly
but
had
to
face
some
things
randolph
had
to
grin
at
a
lot
of
greasy
arabs
in
the
desert
who
thought
they
would
hold
me
for
ransom
had
to
laugh
out
of
their
dull
ambition
a
pack
of
villainous
chinese
thugs
in
gobi
who
felt
it
would
profit
them
to
cut
my
throat
had
to
make
my
way
alone
through
a
jungle
in
central
america
for
days
when
the
beastly
natives
absconded
with
the
supplies
and
left
me
in
the
middle
of
a
job
of
excavation
had
other
little
episodes
but
never
son
i
may
say
truthfully
have
i
shown
such
blue
funk
as
you
did
just
then
before
the
patient
griselda
rot
was
my
only
answer
go
in
to
dinner
it
is
after
ten
old
dibdin
is
gone
and
i
have
been
putting
down
these
foolish
notes
it
must
be
by
some
odd
law
of
balance
or
compensation
i
suppose
that
those
whose
lives
are
least
important
keep
the
fullest
record
of
them
it
is
a
weakness
of
mine
to
wish
to
read
in
the
future
the
things
i
failed
to
do
in
the
past
it
is
really
for
you
o
randolph
byrd
aged
seventy
that
i
am
writing
these
notes
if
only
gertrude
had
made
up
her
masterful
mind
to
three
months
hence
instead
of
three
weeks
i
should
have
taken
my
last
fling
and
gone
by
the
next
boat
to
italy
biagi
that
courteous
scholar
and
humanist
writes
me
from
the
laurentian
at
florence
that
he
has
discovered
some
new
material
concerning
brunetto
teacher
of
dante
among
the
few
ambitions
that
i
dally
with
there
has
always
been
the
one
to
write
a
life
of
brunetto
who
taught
dante
how
a
man
may
become
immortal
i
have
a
fine
copy
of
ser
works
the
tesoro
and
the
tesoretto
and
it
seems
a
shabby
enough
little
encyclopedia
in
verse
of
knowledge
now
somewhat
out
of
date
there
must
have
been
therefore
something
in
the
man
himself
that
enabled
dante
to
attribute
his
own
greatness
to
the
teacher
but
i
can
not
go
to
florence
and
return
in
three
weeks
gertrude
i
know
will
tell
me
i
can
do
it
after
married
but
she
will
expect
me
to
clean
up
the
job
in
two
weeks
there
is
nothing
about
gertrude
that
terrifies
me
so
much
as
her
efficiency
i
shall
never
dare
to
mention
the
subject
to
her
and
so
i
shall
never
attempt
it
and
never
know
the
mystery
of
immortality
it
is
all
one
however
what
have
i
to
do
with
greatness
no
more
than
with
marriage
the
room
is
cold
ligna
super
as
cheerful
old
horace
advises
i
have
just
complied
and
put
another
log
on
the
fire
my
nerves
must
be
a
shade
off
color
i
could
have
sworn
a
moment
ago
as
the
room
grew
chilly
that
my
sister
laura
was
standing
before
me
it
is
my
guilty
conscience
i
suppose
too
late
to
call
her
now
besides
the
telephone
is
no
doubt
still
out
of
order
poor
laura
i
saw
her
white
as
death
with
tears
running
down
her
drawn
cheeks
what
things
are
human
nerves
when
a
bit
unstrung
i
shall
go
and
see
laura
i
have
had
my
conversation
with
griselda
and
it
came
off
not
amiss
griselda
i
began
carelessly
after
dibdin
had
gone
did
i
mention
to
you
that
i
am
to
be
married
in
three
weeks
griselda
is
not
one
to
waste
breath
in
futile
and
flamboyant
feminine
exclamations
she
turned
somewhat
pale
i
thought
you
know
very
well
you
did
not
she
answered
in
level
tones
polishing
a
spoon
the
while
well
i
meant
to
i
told
her
truthfully
enough
you
expect
it
no
sir
was
her
blunt
reply
neither
did
i
i
blurted
out
before
i
knew
it
a
wry
unaccustomed
smile
for
a
moment
illumined
her
dark
features
you
tell
me
that
she
retorted
and
i
wonder
what
she
meant
by
it
it
is
not
like
her
to
waste
words
am
i
she
continued
to
take
this
as
notice
to
find
a
new
place
god
forbid
i
cried
in
horror
whatever
happens
griselda
you
remain
with
that
be
understood
and
suppose
miss
bayard
want
me
she
demanded
with
quiet
intensity
then
she
will
probably
not
want
me
i
told
her
that
question
arise
besides
griselda
i
went
on
we
decided
yet
how
we
are
going
to
manage
miss
bayard
will
probably
want
to
keep
her
apartment
and
i
mine
she
would
hardly
wish
to
be
bothered
with
me
all
the
time
and
you
would
call
that
marriage
exclaimed
griselda
aghast
why
not
i
queried
mildly
i
know
much
about
it
griselda
but
marriage
is
determined
by
the
kind
of
license
you
get
at
the
city
hall
and
what
the
alderman
says
to
you
the
leases
of
apartments
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
quite
i
might
inquire
face
was
blank
for
a
moment
then
on
a
sudden
she
was
bent
double
in
a
gale
of
wild
hysterical
laughter
never
have
i
known
her
so
shaken
by
meaningless
cachinnation
perhaps
her
own
nerves
are
no
better
than
mine
even
now
i
still
hear
her
rattling
deeply
from
time
to
time
like
muffled
thunder
but
i
care
now
what
a
relief
to
get
it
over
it
is
nearly
bedtime
casting
over
the
events
of
the
day
i
can
not
but
conclude
that
my
own
will
has
played
too
small
a
part
in
the
whole
matter
i
must
see
gertrude
in
good
time
and
acquaint
her
with
my
desire
to
run
over
to
florence
before
we
are
married
and
look
up
new
material
bearing
upon
the
blessed
old
heathen
brunetto
latini
since
gertrude
desires
me
to
be
great
and
famous
she
can
not
deny
me
the
opportunity
to
discover
how
a
great
and
famous
man
accomplished
the
trick
besides
what
has
been
delayed
three
years
can
surely
support
a
further
delay
of
three
months
but
good
heavens
what
is
this
scuffling
of
feet
in
the
army
is
invading
me
at
this
hour
i
believe
i
hear
a
scream
from
griselda
who
has
never
screamed
in
her
life
dear
sister
dead
her
children
are
with
me
without
warning
she
dropped
suddenly
under
her
burdens
and
with
her
dying
breath
confided
her
children
to
that
one
cataclysmic
fact
has
taken
its
abode
in
my
brain
and
numbed
it
as
well
as
all
my
nerves
to
a
chill
and
deadly
paralysis
that
excludes
everything
else
it
still
seems
wholly
nightmare
from
which
i
shall
awake
with
a
vast
sickly
sort
of
relief
to
the
old
custom
of
my
tranquil
life
the
turbulence
and
the
pain
of
the
last
three
days
however
are
still
lashing
about
me
like
the
angry
waves
after
a
tempest
in
a
manner
too
realistic
for
any
dream
i
am
broad
awake
now
i
know
and
for
hours
i
have
been
blankly
staring
into
a
very
abyss
of
darkness
what
will
happen
or
what
i
shall
do
next
i
the
shadow
of
an
idea
laura
is
dead
and
her
children
are
with
me
and
i
am
their
guardian
and
sole
reliance
who
could
have
forecast
such
a
fate
or
such
a
rôle
for
me
three
days
it
is
incredible
only
three
days
ago
i
was
languidly
protesting
because
i
could
not
take
ship
forthwith
for
italy
to
examine
some
manuscript
at
the
laurentian
in
florence
no
by
heavens
it
was
not
i
it
was
some
one
one
i
knew
vaguely
in
a
past
age
a
man
to
be
envied
serene
and
cheerful
blest
of
life
whom
i
shall
never
meet
again
the
last
three
days
i
can
not
banish
them
and
yet
i
can
not
meet
the
memory
of
them
was
it
i
who
faced
the
tragedy
or
was
it
some
one
else
nothing
surely
is
more
tragic
than
a
young
that
young
mother
my
own
sister
who
was
it
that
stonily
passed
through
the
ordeal
of
the
arrangements
and
the
black
pantomime
of
the
sepulture
i
can
not
record
it
even
for
myself
for
never
i
know
shall
i
desire
to
be
reminded
of
it
at
the
death
of
my
mother
i
still
had
laura
with
her
practical
sense
but
now
i
was
alone
i
say
now
because
however
remote
it
seems
this
tragedy
will
always
be
present
my
life
must
forever
remain
under
its
stupefying
spell
it
is
not
credible
that
only
three
days
ago
i
sat
here
in
my
study
revolving
trifles
those
many
shining
trifles
that
went
to
make
up
my
former
life
three
days
ago
the
silence
of
this
house
was
disturbed
by
the
voices
of
children
the
clatter
of
their
feet
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
heard
griselda
scream
oh
randolph
she
rushed
in
sobbing
with
the
dry
tearless
sobs
of
those
much
acquainted
with
grief
miss
children
are
here
i
knew
though
inwardly
i
sank
all
but
lifeless
under
the
blow
i
knew
clearly
that
laura
was
dead
is
she
very
ill
i
heard
myself
asking
faintly
with
a
clutching
desire
to
shrink
still
from
the
appalling
truth
randolph
she
lamented
you
know
very
well
she
suddenly
added
with
a
harshness
that
surprised
me
we
shall
have
to
put
the
children
to
bed
in
your
bedroom
it
was
as
though
she
had
suddenly
revolted
at
the
softness
of
the
atmosphere
in
my
environment
at
any
artificiality
or
evasion
she
seemed
abruptly
determined
to
face
the
stark
facts
in
the
open
the
girl
will
sleep
with
me
she
concluded
tonelessly
and
turned
to
go
which
girl
i
queried
dazedly
her
that
brought
the
bairns
she
replied
and
left
me
send
her
in
want
to
speak
to
her
i
shouted
after
griselda
i
could
not
face
the
thought
of
going
out
there
i
was
held
to
my
chair
by
a
sheer
pitiful
lack
of
courage
to
move
into
the
dreadful
gulf
before
me
i
closed
my
eyes
and
endeavored
to
still
the
tumult
in
my
brain
into
silence
i
wanted
to
think
but
only
those
can
achieve
silence
who
do
not
need
it
i
could
not
i
opened
my
eyes
a
thin
little
girl
of
perhaps
twelve
or
thirteen
stood
before
me
this
surely
could
not
be
the
girl
griselda
had
referred
to
in
charge
of
the
children
she
was
herself
a
child
were
my
disordered
senses
tricking
me
i
experienced
the
thrill
hero
must
have
felt
at
sight
of
the
raven
on
the
bust
of
pallas
who
are
you
i
whispered
i
am
alicia
sir
she
answered
with
large
frightened
gray
eyes
fastened
upon
mine
is
it
i
stammered
the
lady
said
you
wanted
to
see
me
did
you
bring
the
children
i
breathed
incredulous
yes
sir
i
was
awestruck
her
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
child
yet
they
were
filled
with
sorrow
and
a
searching
fear
old
as
the
world
how
old
are
you
i
could
not
help
asking
with
an
irrelevance
foolish
enough
in
the
circumstances
going
on
fourteen
sir
and
are
the
nurse
i
helped
pendleton
with
the
children
before
school
and
after
school
she
answered
with
more
assurance
now
but
still
uneasy
i
am
a
helper
sir
there
was
no
mirth
in
my
soul
but
the
muscles
contorted
my
features
into
a
sickly
grin
i
see
i
murmured
mendaciously
but
i
saw
only
my
own
confused
turpitude
at
my
blindness
and
neglect
in
face
of
the
shifts
and
needs
poor
laura
had
been
compelled
to
suffer
where
do
you
come
from
i
inquired
with
a
dry
throat
ashamed
to
ask
anything
of
importance
home
sullivan
county
she
murmured
hesitatingly
with
a
tinge
of
color
in
her
cheeks
on
a
sudden
i
saw
her
pale
lips
tremble
and
guiltily
i
realized
that
thoughtless
after
my
wont
i
was
subjecting
her
to
an
ordeal
merely
because
i
was
in
torment
sit
down
i
forced
myself
to
speak
evenly
and
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
she
sidled
to
the
big
chair
her
gaze
still
fixed
upon
me
as
though
to
watch
me
was
henceforth
her
first
anxiety
she
gripped
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
hung
undecided
for
a
moment
as
though
fearful
of
making
herself
so
much
at
home
as
to
sit
down
in
this
room
sit
down
i
reiterated
more
encouragingly
and
tell
me
what
happened
to
my
sister
yes
sir
she
murmured
obediently
perching
on
the
edge
of
the
great
chair
well
she
began
when
i
came
home
from
school
in
the
afternoon
pendleton
was
lying
down
the
children
were
hanging
about
her
bed
and
she
looked
very
pale
yes
yes
i
urged
her
on
impatiently
then
i
took
them
downstairs
and
gave
them
their
bread
and
milk
and
tried
to
read
to
them
so
as
to
keep
them
quiet
but
only
the
littlest
one
jimmie
wanted
to
listen
randolph
and
laura
wanted
to
play
kings
and
queens
i
realized
that
i
must
hear
the
story
in
the
own
way
then
she
continued
with
an
effort
at
exactitude
i
thought
that
jimmie
and
i
had
better
join
them
because
then
i
could
keep
them
from
making
so
much
noise
we
played
until
supper
time
but
pendleton
feel
well
enough
to
come
down
so
the
children
and
i
had
supper
downstairs
and
the
supper
up
on
a
tray
that
must
have
been
while
i
was
lamenting
to
dibdin
over
the
hardness
of
my
lot
then
what
happened
i
muttered
turning
away
from
her
gaze
i
went
up
to
see
if
pendleton
wanted
anything
she
resumed
nervously
frightened
by
my
movement
and
she
said
no
but
that
get
up
later
when
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
to
bed
so
i
helped
them
with
their
lessons
until
bedtime
and
pendleton
came
down
she
said
she
felt
a
little
better
but
she
looked
very
sad
and
white
and
when
she
began
to
walk
up
the
her
lips
grew
tremulous
again
and
the
tears
dashed
out
of
her
eyes
but
she
finally
controlled
herself
bravely
she
began
to
weep
bitterly
she
just
said
and
that
was
and
that
piteous
child
who
was
no
kindred
to
my
poor
sister
sobbed
convulsively
that
must
have
been
about
the
time
when
i
was
at
table
with
dibdin
and
over
the
sauterne
complaining
to
him
of
the
narrowness
of
my
income
in
view
of
the
lacunæ
and
wants
of
my
library
we
the
telephone
she
found
breath
to
utter
at
last
so
i
brought
the
children
told
me
how
to
over
there
alone
nothing
in
this
world
can
ever
stab
me
again
as
the
poignancy
of
her
recital
stabbed
me
my
life
seemed
shattered
irreparable
all
my
dreams
were
at
an
end
laura
was
gone
and
here
were
her
children
thrust
by
destiny
upon
my
their
scoundrel
of
a
father
should
ever
return
to
relieve
me
of
them
i
had
lived
peacefully
and
harmlessly
in
my
way
but
for
some
inscrutable
reason
fate
had
selected
me
for
her
heaviest
blow
very
well
i
told
her
as
kindly
as
i
could
in
the
conditions
now
you
go
back
to
griselda
and
go
to
bed
have
to
think
things
out
the
house
exclaimed
the
little
never
again
do
i
wish
to
see
such
horror
on
a
childish
countenance
as
at
that
instant
froze
the
features
of
little
alicia
all
alone
she
added
her
thin
shoulders
heaving
you
going
over
now
sir
now
i
exclaimed
looking
automatically
at
my
watch
a
few
minutes
child
is
there
she
stammered
nobody
better
go
back
it
was
obvious
of
course
that
i
must
go
at
once
but
why
should
a
child
see
spontaneously
that
to
which
i
am
obtuse
oh
well
you
are
right
of
must
go
go
over
now
i
turned
away
from
her
lifted
the
curtain
and
gazed
out
into
the
wet
murky
street
below
life
had
collapsed
and
the
ruins
of
it
were
tumbled
about
my
hot
ears
i
hardly
know
how
long
i
stood
there
completely
oblivious
of
the
girl
alicia
please
byrd
i
was
startled
to
hear
a
tearful
childish
voice
behind
you
see
the
children
before
you
go
sir
i
wheeled
about
sharply
the
children
oh
the
horror
of
the
situation
fell
about
me
like
an
avalanche
that
had
hung
suspended
for
a
moment
and
then
crashed
smotheringly
over
me
no
i
whispered
huskily
i
now
a
kind
of
chill
darkness
numbed
my
senses
like
a
pistol
shot
i
suddenly
heard
the
harsh
voice
of
griselda
in
the
doorway
the
cab
is
at
the
door
randolph
forget
your
rubbers
and
like
an
automaton
galvanized
into
life
i
found
myself
whirling
to
the
house
of
death
for
a
week
the
children
have
been
with
me
and
nothing
has
yet
been
done
about
them
another
week
i
think
will
drive
me
mad
with
indecision
i
seem
unable
to
emerge
from
the
shadow
of
mystery
and
terror
into
which
my
serene
world
has
been
so
suddenly
plunged
the
study
is
my
solitary
refuge
and
like
a
schoolgirl
i
can
do
no
more
than
unpack
my
heart
with
words
i
have
seen
gertrude
it
is
astonishing
how
resourceless
are
even
nearest
and
dearest
friends
in
face
of
anything
really
capital
poor
ranny
how
ghastly
gertrude
cried
when
she
first
heard
of
it
wringing
my
hand
but
buck
up
dear
boy
you
know
how
i
feel
there
is
a
way
out
for
everything
she
spoke
i
thought
as
though
i
were
in
need
of
ready
money
she
was
here
this
afternoon
to
see
the
children
gertrude
is
no
hand
with
children
they
seemed
strangely
shy
of
her
a
woman
though
they
literally
fell
upon
the
neck
of
growling
grizzled
old
dibdin
they
are
still
subdued
by
the
suddenness
of
their
tragedy
though
real
sorrow
gertrude
tells
me
is
thank
heaven
beyond
them
have
to
think
up
a
way
of
disposing
of
the
dear
things
she
remarked
briskly
and
though
i
am
myself
completely
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
them
i
can
not
say
i
relished
her
way
of
putting
it
what
for
instance
could
you
suggest
i
inquired
dully
schools
ranny
dear
schools
she
impatiently
answered
there
are
homelike
places
run
by
splendid
made
for
such
cases
why
even
the
little
is
it
old
is
he
four
are
places
even
for
kiddies
as
young
as
that
a
heavy
confusion
the
reverse
of
enthusiasm
oppressed
me
you
forget
gertrude
i
endeavored
as
gently
as
possible
to
remind
her
laura
confided
those
children
to
me
with
her
dying
only
relative
do
you
think
i
ought
to
fling
them
out
at
once
god
knows
where
good
lord
ranny
she
cried
flushing
with
a
smile
of
anger
peculiar
to
gertrude
when
she
is
annoyed
what
a
sentimentalist
you
are
at
all
a
i
felt
hurt
just
put
yourself
in
my
place
gertrude
and
see
how
easy
such
a
decision
would
be
for
you
i
do
ranny
that
is
just
what
i
am
doing
she
insisted
impatiently
but
you
see
that
if
there
is
any
one
thing
you
can
not
do
it
is
to
keep
them
in
my
apartment
yes
i
said
i
see
that
but
i
also
see
that
i
pitch
them
out
among
total
strangers
a
week
after
their
i
could
not
trust
my
foolish
voice
to
finish
do
you
forget
demanded
gertrude
with
her
smile
that
brands
me
imbecile
do
you
forget
ranny
that
we
are
to
be
married
in
two
weeks
no
from
it
but
that
is
why
we
are
discussing
this
it
is
perplexing
besides
schools
of
the
right
sort
are
bound
to
be
pretty
expensive
things
oh
said
gertrude
of
course
but
poor
income
ought
to
be
my
dear
gertrude
that
is
what
i
know
carmichael
is
to
give
me
an
accounting
of
it
or
laura
never
spoke
of
her
money
matters
to
me
but
as
you
say
there
will
probably
be
enough
only
it
altogether
see
i
floundered
yes
i
see
ranny
i
see
she
hammered
at
me
in
the
maddening
way
women
have
you
simply
get
up
enough
will
power
to
do
something
the
old
story
but
have
to
my
dear
and
she
smiled
sweetly
you
have
all
my
sympathy
and
all
the
coöperation
take
but
the
one
thing
we
do
is
stand
still
you
understand
you
ranny
yes
i
understand
that
but
my
brain
is
as
fertile
of
plans
as
a
glass
door
knob
tell
you
what
do
ranny
gertrude
summarized
i
know
all
this
has
been
a
great
shock
to
you
let
you
alone
for
a
couple
of
days
to
turn
things
over
and
think
of
what
said
but
then
we
must
come
to
some
definite
decision
give
anything
if
this
terrible
thing
had
not
happened
it
be
helped
can
it
now
that
was
very
sweet
and
reasonable
of
gertrude
and
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
she
feels
distressed
but
it
would
have
been
ten
thousand
more
if
poor
laura
had
died
just
after
we
had
been
married
instead
of
before
as
it
is
the
problem
before
me
is
largely
mine
were
we
now
married
gertrude
must
have
had
to
bear
an
undue
share
of
it
shall
i
ever
win
back
to
the
old
tranquillity
and
the
peace
that
was
mine
that
was
the
first
thought
that
came
to
me
when
i
parted
from
gertrude
a
selfish
thought
as
i
immediately
realized
in
view
of
what
is
facing
me
i
can
no
longer
think
as
i
have
thought
and
new
feelings
are
struggling
for
birth
within
me
commensurate
with
the
new
responsibility
the
world
as
i
walk
through
it
seems
to
present
an
aspect
strangely
different
from
what
it
did
a
week
ago
it
is
so
chill
and
alien
and
hollow
as
i
was
reëntering
my
study
i
heard
a
crash
in
the
dining
room
which
is
now
the
room
and
when
i
glanced
in
upon
them
the
girl
alicia
was
gathering
up
smithereens
of
glass
and
ranny
the
eldest
boy
quietly
announced
it
broke
in
a
manner
that
so
obviously
gave
him
away
all
the
others
could
not
help
laughing
and
they
laughed
the
louder
when
i
joined
them
confused
and
angry
the
boy
ran
out
of
the
room
it
is
a
world
apart
the
world
of
children
into
which
parents
i
suppose
grow
gradually
not
being
the
parent
of
these
children
i
fear
i
shall
never
penetrate
it
sooner
or
later
they
must
be
sent
away
even
as
gertrude
maintains
and
i
must
face
that
event
forthwith
i
was
interrupted
at
this
point
by
the
irruption
into
the
room
of
jimmie
the
youngest
inimitably
grotesquely
shapeless
in
his
nightgear
pattering
toward
me
and
taking
refuge
between
my
knees
he
was
being
pursued
by
the
girl
alicia
who
stood
shyly
and
distressfully
smiling
in
the
doorway
as
though
all
explanation
were
futile
well
old
boy
what
is
it
i
demanded
with
mock
severity
though
in
truth
i
was
more
afraid
of
him
than
he
evidently
was
of
me
iwantsayprayerstoyoulikeamummy
he
uttered
in
one
excited
breath
as
though
it
were
one
single
word
you
want
what
he
says
he
wants
to
say
his
prayers
to
you
sir
spoke
up
the
girl
clearly
i
am
broke
away
shall
i
take
him
away
sir
wanto
say
my
prayers
to
you
like
to
mummy
insisted
child
scrambling
upon
my
knees
and
with
a
pang
of
sadness
that
set
all
my
senses
aching
i
saw
the
picture
of
the
laura
with
her
sweet
resigned
face
living
when
she
lived
only
in
her
children
listening
to
the
prayers
of
this
sprite
with
the
silken
sunshine
in
his
hair
all
right
jimmie
i
murmured
faintly
as
he
clung
to
me
go
ahead
tightly
clutching
me
about
the
neck
and
nestling
his
face
against
mine
he
brought
forth
with
childish
throaty
sweetness
the
few
words
to
the
creative
spirit
that
mankind
the
world
over
in
one
form
or
another
addresses
as
our
father
and
god
he
concluded
with
brilliant
triumph
in
his
eyes
bless
mummy
and
uncle
ranny
nothing
that
i
can
remember
has
ever
moved
me
as
that
child
moved
me
like
catherine
of
genoa
at
her
decisive
confessional
i
seemed
to
receive
a
profound
inner
wound
by
that
act
tender
and
bitter
and
sweet
that
i
never
desire
to
heal
for
the
moment
laura
and
i
were
nearer
to
being
one
than
ever
we
had
been
in
her
lifetime
nevermore
shall
i
forget
the
sweetness
and
fragrance
of
that
little
child
and
his
warm
nestling
faith
in
me
and
i
am
planning
to
cast
him
off
come
now
interposed
alicia
as
though
breaking
a
spell
one
more
hug
cried
jimmie
with
the
arrogance
of
righteousness
and
suiting
his
action
to
his
words
he
clambered
down
with
engaging
clumsiness
from
my
knees
and
padded
toward
alicia
once
more
i
was
alone
with
my
thoughts
can
it
be
that
some
instinct
in
the
child
whose
heart
is
still
imbedded
in
his
had
made
him
seek
the
one
person
who
had
been
nearest
his
mother
i
can
not
say
i
can
not
say
oh
i
must
send
him
and
the
others
children
away
away
among
strangers
there
seems
to
be
no
other
way
out
i
have
been
turning
idly
the
pages
of
books
in
a
way
bookish
people
have
seeking
for
inspiration
for
some
word
of
guidance
brunetto
tells
me
on
the
word
of
bernard
that
tarnished
gold
is
better
than
shining
copper
and
that
the
wild
ass
brays
once
every
hour
and
thus
makes
an
excellent
timepiece
for
his
savage
neighborhood
but
nothing
of
this
casts
a
glimmer
of
light
upon
my
dilemma
rabelais
keeps
shouting
from
his
yellow
page
ce
que
but
what
is
it
that
i
desire
to
do
ah
i
know
what
i
desire
to
do
there
is
counsel
in
the
old
books
after
all
i
will
have
in
the
girl
alicia
and
see
what
i
can
glean
she
was
brought
up
without
kith
or
kin
of
her
own
and
though
an
institution
is
more
of
a
machine
than
a
good
school
still
those
who
had
the
rearing
of
her
were
total
strangers
there
might
be
some
gleam
of
suggestion
in
that
alicia
has
been
here
come
child
sit
down
i
invited
her
observing
that
she
still
displayed
a
tendency
to
stand
in
awe
of
me
i
wish
to
ask
you
some
questions
but
her
tense
little
face
was
still
haunted
by
a
vague
fear
about
the
children
i
added
and
she
seemed
somewhat
more
at
ease
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
how
long
were
you
at
that
sullivan
county
i
began
grinning
by
way
of
ingratiating
myself
ever
since
i
can
remember
sir
she
answered
were
they
kind
to
you
oh
yes
sir
how
kind
did
they
do
for
you
they
gave
us
food
medicine
when
we
were
sick
and
on
christmas
we
had
a
tree
only
nobody
ever
came
to
see
me
i
always
looked
out
of
the
window
for
somebody
to
come
but
no
one
came
yes
yes
i
know
i
pursued
but
did
they
show
you
alicia
was
silent
you
know
what
i
mean
i
pressed
yes
sir
i
think
i
do
then
why
you
answer
hard
to
explain
and
she
laughed
a
frightened
little
laugh
there
is
no
one
there
do
those
things
you
said
there
were
five
hundred
of
us
there
if
not
sick
you
just
go
on
like
all
the
rest
if
sick
they
give
you
oil
or
something
sometimes
a
child
pretends
sick
just
so
the
matron
or
a
nurse
might
take
it
in
her
lap
and
make
a
fuss
over
it
and
some
are
the
same
reason
i
nodded
gravely
but
my
heart
was
gripped
by
a
poignant
aching
i
saw
children
compelled
to
feign
illness
or
delinquency
in
order
to
receive
a
touch
of
individual
attention
which
i
suppose
every
child
spontaneously
craves
were
you
glad
to
leave
there
i
asked
oh
yes
sir
she
answered
eagerly
tragic
my
poor
sister
dying
i
said
half
to
myself
she
was
an
ideal
mother
hardly
know
what
to
do
alicia
leaped
from
her
chair
and
came
yearning
toward
me
her
little
face
tremulous
and
working
she
cried
out
oh
byrd
you
send
us
a
you
no
no
to
a
home
i
replied
defensively
but
must
be
good
places
for
feel
terribly
she
stifled
a
sob
they
love
it
so
here
laura
cries
for
her
mother
every
little
never
mind
i
took
her
up
hastily
nothing
is
decided
yet
my
dear
child
glad
i
spoke
to
you
you
see
i
ran
on
so
little
room
here
and
know
nothing
about
but
nothing
to
do
she
protested
sobbing
nothing
i
smiled
vaguely
in
an
effort
to
cheer
her
and
laid
my
hand
upon
her
thin
shoulder
nothing
except
just
love
them
she
said
take
care
of
i
can
how
simple
well
well
we
shall
see
i
aimed
to
be
reassuring
do
i
have
to
to
the
home
she
asked
brokenly
with
an
arm
hiding
her
face
oh
no
certainly
not
i
answered
hastily
find
a
better
way
than
that
now
i
added
be
a
good
girl
dry
your
eyes
run
along
and
say
a
word
conversation
no
sir
she
murmured
obediently
and
still
gulping
she
left
me
it
is
obvious
that
the
girl
alicia
has
been
of
decisive
help
to
me
yet
it
is
equally
obvious
that
i
can
not
keep
the
children
here
dibdin
has
been
here
and
he
has
left
me
in
a
state
of
distraction
worse
if
possible
than
that
i
had
been
in
before
the
good
fellow
endeavored
to
be
vastly
and
solidly
cheering
all
nonsense
he
growled
about
children
being
hostages
to
fortune
they
are
the
only
contribution
a
human
being
really
makes
to
the
world
all
the
digging
that
burrowing
animals
such
as
i
do
in
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
all
the
fuss
that
fellows
in
laboratories
make
over
test
tubes
and
microscopes
and
metals
and
germs
all
the
stuff
that
people
sat
up
nights
to
put
into
those
damned
books
of
of
that
is
done
for
the
next
generation
and
the
generations
they
will
beget
eloquent
i
flippantly
mocked
him
but
how
is
it
elected
to
be
what
you
call
a
tramp
elected
he
grunted
disdainfully
i
elect
it
elected
me
besides
he
continued
lowering
his
voice
i
would
have
given
it
up
like
a
up
anything
changed
my
life
inside
out
done
anything
if
i
had
been
able
to
marry
the
one
woman
i
wanted
one
of
those
strange
beasts
for
whom
there
is
only
one
woman
in
the
other
heaven
would
make
me
such
another
world
of
one
entire
and
perfect
chrysolite
not
have
sold
her
for
it
he
quoted
and
added
with
a
hoarse
laugh
you
ought
to
know
your
othello
then
why
on
earth
you
marry
her
i
could
not
help
marveling
too
late
he
murmured
with
a
whimsical
smiling
twitch
to
his
head
that
is
very
engaging
she
was
already
married
to
somebody
else
when
i
first
saw
her
too
late
he
repeated
with
ruminative
sadness
but
let
us
talk
about
that
he
broke
off
abruptly
have
the
kids
begun
to
go
to
school
yet
what
is
the
use
i
answered
him
gloomily
i
formed
any
plans
for
them
yet
plans
what
do
you
mean
he
inquired
puzzled
like
the
girl
alicia
he
seemed
to
think
there
was
nothing
to
do
that
required
any
thought
and
i
wondered
if
the
simple
souls
in
life
are
only
the
improvident
or
the
very
young
do
you
see
this
place
i
demanded
irritably
as
a
home
for
a
family
with
three
children
to
say
nothing
of
a
fourth
in
attendance
upon
them
have
to
have
a
larger
course
he
answered
glibly
puffing
at
his
pipe
and
am
i
a
person
to
take
care
of
and
bring
up
three
or
four
children
why
the
devil
not
he
demanded
why
the
devil
yes
i
retorted
fiercely
what
do
i
know
about
children
what
experience
have
i
had
do
you
see
me
as
a
wet
nurse
to
a
lot
of
babies
wet
nurse
be
hanged
he
responded
gruffly
your
first
chance
to
be
of
use
in
the
world
talk
like
easy
to
talk
ruefully
from
me
well
what
the
blazes
do
you
mean
to
do
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
work
out
i
fell
upon
him
bitterly
think
easy
got
to
work
out
some
homes
for
right
kind
of
a
home
environment
oh
easy
i
assure
you
besides
i
ran
on
savagely
you
seem
to
forget
to
be
married
in
two
weeks
i
did
forget
that
growled
dibdin
with
a
semblance
of
contrition
what
does
the
lady
say
well
what
should
she
say
could
you
expect
a
girl
on
her
wedding
day
to
become
the
harassed
mother
of
three
children
not
her
own
dibdin
jumped
from
his
chair
ground
an
oath
between
his
teeth
and
his
forehead
was
a
file
of
wrinkles
listen
randolph
he
began
in
another
voice
damnably
tough
and
i
know
it
but
you
you
simply
disperse
your
children
to
god
knows
where
you
are
the
only
relation
got
put
yourself
in
their
place
it
would
be
damnation
if
you
money
he
stammered
in
confusion
why
dash
an
old
enough
friend
of
yours
advance
you
some
eh
and
he
laughed
raucously
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
you
are
a
good
tramp
i
grinned
sheepishly
seizing
his
hand
but
it
that
i
know
as
yet
what
laura
left
them
but
it
that
i
feel
hell
about
what
can
i
with
gertrude
everything
else
oh
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
i
assure
i
wish
to
god
i
could
see
my
way
to
keeping
them
easy
or
not
said
dibdin
huskily
if
you
send
those
children
away
break
every
bone
in
your
body
i
laughed
almost
hysterically
i
know
dibdin
when
he
is
most
moved
and
most
sympathetic
he
is
at
his
most
violent
go
i
clung
to
him
as
with
sunken
head
he
shouldered
toward
the
door
must
he
growled
got
to
think
too
i
wish
you
had
married
dibdin
and
had
children
of
your
own
i
all
but
whispered
with
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
sorry
for
the
woman
a
good
devil
dibdin
i
wish
i
knew
who
the
woman
is
tell
you
murmured
dibdin
with
a
queer
throatiness
of
tone
tell
you
who
she
was
it
matter
now
she
by
god
i
now
and
he
shuffled
out
leaving
me
gazing
after
him
speechless
and
the
girl
alicia
keeps
watching
me
like
some
bewildered
household
animal
dimly
aware
of
the
breaking
up
of
its
household
always
i
am
conscious
of
her
great
eyes
upon
me
to
her
i
presume
i
am
a
setebos
who
can
inflict
pain
and
torture
like
death
himself
who
can
disrupt
her
little
world
of
clinging
affections
by
the
merest
movement
of
my
hand
i
am
in
that
process
of
turning
things
over
to
which
gertrude
has
indulgently
consigned
me
and
i
am
if
anything
farther
away
from
a
decision
than
i
was
hours
ago
i
finger
my
books
and
open
at
random
a
volume
of
montaigne
in
an
edition
that
is
as
fragrant
of
good
ink
and
paper
as
the
tudor
english
is
rich
and
the
first
line
that
falls
under
my
eye
is
that
of
seneca
that
lives
not
somewhat
to
others
liveth
little
to
does
this
mean
that
my
long
absorption
in
my
own
small
concerns
has
made
me
incapable
of
decision
in
anything
of
i
live
too
little
i
stole
into
the
bedroom
last
night
where
the
children
were
sleeping
while
griselda
was
making
up
my
couch
in
the
study
with
their
flushed
faces
they
lay
there
almost
visibly
glowing
before
my
eyes
with
that
perfect
faith
that
children
seem
to
have
in
the
world
about
them
heine
somewhere
speaks
of
angels
guarding
the
couch
and
it
is
not
sheer
poetry
their
faith
and
trust
still
illusioned
brevets
i
suppose
to
angelic
rank
every
one
about
them
randolph
with
a
slight
frown
and
moving
lips
dreaming
seemingly
of
something
active
and
strenuous
as
befits
his
ripe
age
of
eleven
laura
serene
with
her
countenance
and
straying
curls
and
little
jimmie
with
his
tumbled
hair
like
that
of
some
child
by
praxiteles
or
in
their
trust
despite
their
recent
shattering
bereavement
no
one
can
really
know
anything
about
children
until
he
has
seen
them
sleeping
like
fortune
they
are
always
trustfully
in
the
lap
of
the
gods
never
before
had
they
touched
me
as
they
seemed
to
touch
the
hidden
springs
in
me
at
that
moment
it
was
so
i
pictured
that
laura
was
wont
to
steal
into
their
dormitory
of
nights
before
going
to
bed
and
that
vision
no
doubt
was
a
potent
help
to
her
courage
to
continue
uncomplainingly
and
brave
in
the
face
of
sorrow
humiliation
and
her
loneliness
would
i
had
been
able
to
picture
such
things
more
clearly
while
she
was
living
griselda
surprised
me
emerging
from
the
room
and
she
smiled
the
austere
inscrutable
griselda
with
such
a
smile
as
michelangelo
might
have
depicted
on
the
face
of
one
of
his
sistine
sybils
those
weird
sisters
who
seem
to
know
all
things
because
they
have
suffered
all
i
muttered
a
casual
good
night
to
griselda
and
brushed
by
her
nonchalantly
as
a
boy
whistles
with
apparent
carelessness
when
he
feels
most
awkward
or
uneasy
i
slept
upon
my
problem
in
the
way
old
wives
advise
you
but
i
am
no
nearer
the
solution
i
keep
trying
coolly
to
imagine
them
in
appropriately
chosen
schools
and
homes
and
yet
some
tugging
at
my
heart
strings
some
strange
alchemy
of
the
brain
wipes
out
those
images
before
they
are
formed
and
replaces
them
with
the
vision
i
saw
last
night
in
my
invaded
bedroom
who
is
to
help
me
make
a
choice
and
before
i
have
put
down
these
words
i
realize
that
no
one
will
help
me
my
dining
room
is
at
this
moment
vocal
with
their
something
within
me
is
more
loudly
clamorous
yet
against
the
treachery
i
am
planning
them
treachery
that
is
nonsense
of
course
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
decide
what
i
choose
but
already
that
word
keeps
recurring
in
my
brain
whenever
i
envisage
their
dispersal
my
decision
is
taken
i
can
hardly
say
who
made
it
in
reality
i
suppose
it
has
made
itself
but
however
it
came
about
help
me
is
gertrude
telephoned
that
she
was
coming
this
afternoon
i
offered
to
go
to
her
but
she
would
drop
in
she
graciously
insisted
now
that
i
was
a
family
man
after
lunching
with
a
friend
at
the
brevoort
entry
is
always
breezy
and
cheerful
hello
ranny
she
murmured
lightly
sinking
on
the
sofa
and
holding
out
both
hands
i
took
them
kissed
them
and
held
them
in
mine
i
was
well
aware
that
for
her
these
were
days
of
tension
nice
said
gertrude
with
a
laugh
but
what
i
want
is
a
cigarette
a
match
and
an
ash
tray
of
course
how
stupid
of
me
i
mumbled
and
supplied
her
with
her
wants
those
books
ranny
she
puffed
scanning
my
laden
shelves
they
terrify
me
afresh
every
time
i
see
i
think
read
them
all
they
alarm
you
i
deprecated
quite
sincerely
the
more
i
read
them
the
less
i
seem
to
you
will
agree
and
i
sat
facing
her
no
room
for
the
brains
to
turn
round
in
she
laughed
oh
come
dear
boy
not
so
bad
as
that
i
really
think
she
added
more
soberly
you
have
a
very
wise
old
bean
on
your
shoulders
what
sudden
and
startling
discovery
leads
you
to
words
so
rash
i
inquired
made
the
discovery
all
right
she
nodded
with
emphasis
anybody
who
can
handle
a
situation
like
this
the
way
handling
it
is
no
piker
gertrude
often
affects
the
slang
of
the
day
as
a
humorous
protest
against
what
she
terms
my
purism
but
the
truth
is
i
like
the
vernacular
myself
impart
it
i
urged
her
whereat
she
smiled
regular
street
arab
you
are
she
declared
with
arch
satire
but
what
i
mean
is
this
i
am
always
one
for
quick
i
know
much
about
children
i
urged
you
to
send
them
away
at
once
but
i
realize
now
that
so
soon
after
poor
passing
away
that
would
have
been
it
have
looked
well
besides
now
i
see
it
more
your
way
ranny
you
do
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
yes
she
continued
firmly
i
see
your
way
is
best
i
see
that
we
can
be
quietly
married
and
have
our
little
trip
just
the
same
then
when
we
come
back
in
the
natural
course
of
events
and
rearrangement
we
can
look
up
places
for
them
and
settle
it
all
right
as
rain
what
you
had
in
your
clever
old
head
ranny
quite
i
admire
you
for
it
i
see
i
gasped
wondering
what
words
or
acts
of
mine
had
conveyed
this
elaborate
strategy
to
gertrude
for
the
space
of
a
minute
perhaps
i
was
sunk
in
thought
the
vision
of
the
children
asleep
in
their
innocent
faith
in
me
suddenly
arose
vividly
and
smote
me
to
the
heart
the
nestling
image
of
girl
alicia
with
her
great
wistful
eyes
telling
me
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
just
love
them
this
was
throbbing
in
my
brain
with
every
heartbeat
and
had
i
in
reality
schemed
out
the
intricate
design
with
which
gertrude
now
credited
me
by
no
cudgeling
of
my
poor
brains
could
i
recall
any
such
devising
it
was
impossible
it
was
new
to
me
then
something
in
me
that
is
either
better
or
worse
than
myself
took
the
reins
of
the
occasion
and
like
the
auditor
of
speech
i
heard
myself
saying
with
solemn
firmness
no
must
have
mistaken
me
i
had
no
such
plan
we
shall
be
married
of
course
but
our
marriage
can
make
no
difference
i
can
not
turn
these
children
children
out
of
the
house
not
now
at
all
events
not
until
older
they
have
no
one
in
the
world
but
me
and
i
mean
to
keep
them
mean
to
keep
them
you
mean
that
she
gasped
and
it
pained
me
to
be
the
cause
of
a
deep
flush
on
face
and
neck
never
meant
anything
more
certainly
in
my
life
i
told
her
then
we
marry
said
gertrude
in
a
low
tone
still
scrutinizing
me
as
though
she
were
wondering
whether
she
had
ever
met
me
before
why
not
i
cried
why
should
they
make
so
great
a
difference
in
any
case
you
have
an
idea
that
we
would
each
keep
our
separate
flats
talk
rot
flared
gertrude
in
an
exasperation
which
i
still
deplore
for
the
steely
glitter
in
her
eyes
was
not
pleasant
i
am
not
going
to
make
myself
ridiculous
by
marrying
a
houseful
of
kids
for
whom
my
husband
is
the
nurse
do
you
really
stick
to
that
ranny
yes
gertrude
i
nodded
i
must
gertrude
gazed
at
me
searchingly
for
a
moment
then
to
my
amazement
she
laughed
in
my
face
a
trifle
louder
than
her
wont
laughter
was
at
that
instant
far
from
my
thoughts
oh
well
she
resumed
her
earlier
lightness
of
tone
then
simply
postpone
our
marriage
a
while
get
tired
of
this
maternity
game
ranny
depend
on
it
postponed
it
three
few
months
more
make
much
difference
can
it
then
she
approached
me
and
took
my
hand
little
tender
conscience
must
be
given
its
fling
it
she
began
mockingly
in
imitation
of
a
speech
in
which
she
does
not
excel
never
mind
give
its
little
whim
its
head
a
remarkable
woman
is
gertrude
perhaps
only
proper
she
concluded
more
seriously
that
we
should
postpone
it
since
you
are
just
now
in
mourning
nonsense
i
answered
her
laura
would
certainly
never
have
desired
any
such
thing
our
marriage
will
not
be
a
thing
of
pomp
and
orange
blossoms
we
could
just
as
well
get
married
now
as
any
other
time
no
ranny
she
replied
decisively
now
my
turn
to
be
firm
i
think
i
am
right
i
should
honestly
have
preferred
in
spite
of
the
conditions
that
surrounded
me
to
have
married
gertrude
then
and
there
without
further
delay
we
are
neither
of
us
young
things
full
of
ineffable
inanities
on
the
subject
of
romance
and
i
experienced
a
sober
desire
for
all
possible
finality
in
the
midst
of
the
jumbled
and
painful
confusion
into
which
fate
had
seen
fit
to
cast
me
but
gertrude
was
obdurate
just
as
she
was
about
to
go
there
was
a
gentle
tap
on
the
door
gertrude
whose
hand
was
already
on
the
knob
opened
it
it
was
the
girl
alicia
with
a
downward
quizzical
glance
gertrude
fixed
the
girl
so
that
for
a
moment
she
stood
fascinated
unable
to
detach
her
eyes
from
she
turned
them
in
my
direction
finally
and
they
were
troubled
and
imploring
please
byrd
she
said
the
children
want
to
go
for
a
walk
now
instead
of
lessons
the
sun
is
out
can
i
take
them
yes
yes
i
said
hastily
by
all
means
wait
a
minute
commanded
gertrude
smiling
mechanically
what
is
your
name
child
alicia
alicia
what
alicia
palmer
and
the
voice
was
tremulous
with
trepidation
and
do
you
give
the
children
lessons
yes
she
answered
lowering
her
eyes
as
though
a
crime
had
found
her
out
and
how
old
are
you
asked
gertrude
not
unkindly
going
on
fourteen
the
girl
looked
up
at
once
responsive
to
the
gentler
tone
but
wishing
to
relieve
her
of
the
interrogatory
i
lamely
put
in
a
word
urging
that
she
take
the
children
out
at
once
before
the
sun
had
disappeared
the
girl
glided
away
like
a
shadow
why
quite
little
thing
murmured
gertrude
have
quite
a
menagerie
then
laughingly
turning
to
me
she
cried
oh
ranny
efficiency
ought
to
be
your
middle
name
perhaps
better
adopt
it
i
murmured
do
said
gertrude
well
so
long
old
boy
i
must
be
running
and
in
her
haste
she
even
forgot
to
let
me
kiss
her
so
after
all
the
alderman
at
the
city
hall
was
not
to
sing
his
song
over
us
yet
for
no
reason
that
i
can
help
i
seem
to
be
in
disgrace
with
fortune
gertrude
and
eyes
a
nameless
melancholy
a
kind
of
humorous
sadness
has
taken
possession
of
me
it
is
not
my
lost
tranquillity
that
i
regret
now
nor
does
taunt
of
inefficiency
disturb
me
but
at
bottom
i
have
always
realized
the
type
of
man
that
i
am
not
the
type
of
man
who
stands
in
face
of
all
the
shocks
and
emergencies
of
life
who
can
meet
all
changes
and
events
with
equal
courage
who
can
take
any
situation
smilingly
by
the
hand
as
though
he
were
its
indisputable
and
indulgent
master
that
is
the
sort
of
man
i
should
wish
to
be
but
all
my
own
defects
clamorously
accuse
me
of
embodying
the
exact
opposite
of
such
an
ideal
i
have
shrunk
away
from
life
until
it
fits
me
like
a
coarse
garment
rather
than
a
glove
it
takes
a
vast
deal
of
living
to
be
alive
and
the
dread
obsession
haunts
me
that
i
have
become
as
one
mummified
in
this
dim
catacomb
of
books
i
have
been
to
office
at
his
request
and
the
blow
that
he
has
dealt
me
is
heavier
than
any
since
death
laura
it
appears
in
her
desperate
desire
to
increase
her
income
had
been
speculating
in
the
lying
promises
of
oil
and
mining
stocks
which
offered
fabulous
returns
one
after
another
her
substantial
railway
and
steel
bonds
went
to
her
brokers
for
margins
and
some
were
sold
for
current
livelihood
no
wonder
she
was
compelled
to
resort
to
an
orphanage
for
a
helper
who
is
herself
a
child
the
result
is
that
something
less
than
two
thousand
dollars
of
capital
remains
for
her
three
motherless
and
fatherless
children
the
oldest
of
whom
is
eleven
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
her
tortured
and
silent
anxiety
on
this
score
hastened
my
poor
death
carmichael
himself
her
lawyer
and
adviser
was
ignorant
of
her
acts
until
it
was
too
late
the
dread
goddess
fortune
plainly
does
nothing
by
halves
if
it
were
not
for
my
grief
over
the
suffering
that
poor
laura
must
have
endured
so
uncomplainingly
i
should
be
moved
to
uproarious
laughter
job
i
feel
sure
must
have
had
his
moments
when
the
comforters
were
not
there
when
he
laughed
until
the
tears
bedewed
his
dejected
old
beard
and
i
incompetent
recluse
that
i
am
have
undertaken
the
care
and
the
rearing
of
three
children
i
should
at
least
admire
the
completeness
with
which
fate
plays
her
hands
or
produces
her
situations
were
i
not
at
this
moment
utterly
and
stonily
impervious
to
all
thought
and
all
an
inert
and
deadly
sense
of
disaster
be
an
emotion
no
that
was
not
enough
what
a
glutton
is
that
same
fate
dibdin
has
been
here
to
say
a
hasty
he
has
heard
of
a
ship
that
sails
from
san
francisco
in
a
week
and
that
will
touch
at
his
particular
group
of
islands
so
that
he
will
not
have
to
at
papeete
as
had
been
his
earlier
plan
i
have
never
before
in
my
life
felt
so
utterly
alone
he
laughed
a
curious
laugh
that
seemed
foolish
yet
exulting
when
i
told
him
i
had
decided
to
keep
the
children
his
eyes
glittered
and
he
turned
away
for
an
instant
to
hide
them
look
here
he
muttered
hoarsely
with
the
assumption
of
his
most
manner
let
me
advance
you
a
thousand
dollars
or
case
you
should
have
a
use
for
it
be
an
investment
for
me
he
added
with
a
short
laugh
what
use
is
it
to
me
in
the
marquesas
or
solomon
islands
eh
no
thanks
dibdin
i
told
him
i
can
mention
one
or
two
good
banks
on
the
island
of
you
know
of
any
be
an
ass
randolph
he
came
back
with
severity
write
you
a
cheque
no
you
i
replied
with
equal
obstinacy
i
take
it
if
i
need
it
cable
you
devil
you
will
he
growled
irritably
cables
run
where
be
an
ass
after
all
thanks
would
you
like
to
see
the
children
before
you
go
yes
he
answered
meditatively
no
by
gosh
he
added
in
sudden
confusion
no
i
got
to
run
slews
of
things
still
to
do
inscrutable
devil
dibdin
who
would
have
supposed
him
such
a
bundle
of
emotions
by
the
way
he
said
abruptly
as
he
was
starting
from
all
right
inwardly
i
felt
a
tug
as
though
some
one
had
pulled
violently
upon
some
cord
inside
me
oh
yes
i
lied
as
urbanely
as
i
was
able
everything
quite
all
right
keep
me
in
addresses
i
suppose
he
scrutinized
me
for
an
instant
so
searchingly
that
with
a
tremor
i
feared
he
would
see
through
me
oh
yes
of
course
he
finally
answered
the
hotel
de
france
papeete
is
a
good
address
until
you
hear
of
another
they
know
me
there
good
i
tapped
him
on
the
back
write
a
fellow
a
word
whenever
you
can
pretty
lonely
here
after
gone
lonely
he
repeated
and
by
george
and
almost
you
to
be
married
in
a
few
i
for
the
present
off
he
exclaimed
aghast
did
she
break
it
off
put
it
off
i
corrected
when
you
told
her
of
keeping
the
kids
i
nodded
my
head
slowly
watching
the
odd
play
of
his
features
he
opened
his
arms
quickly
as
though
he
were
about
to
hug
me
like
some
grizzly
old
as
quickly
he
dropped
them
shamefaced
by
god
he
uttered
solemnly
gets
way
things
came
about
are
a
man
randolph
my
lad
wins
everything
in
the
end
even
when
it
loses
it
wins
yes
sir
i
have
not
the
remotest
idea
what
he
meant
by
those
words
broken
up
about
it
he
demanded
abruptly
what
my
gesture
proclaimed
to
dibdin
i
know
for
me
it
expressed
all
that
i
had
passed
through
during
the
last
ten
days
no
right
no
use
he
said
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
sit
tight
my
boy
only
thing
now
he
wrung
my
hand
and
god
bless
you
same
to
you
old
boy
and
best
of
luck
and
now
the
only
intimate
friend
i
possess
has
gone
and
left
a
hole
in
the
atmosphere
as
large
as
central
park
an
odd
look
of
overt
approval
i
have
surprised
of
late
in
eyes
causes
me
a
peculiar
twinge
of
regret
it
shows
that
new
conditions
have
overwhelmingly
ousted
the
old
griselda
never
troubled
to
approve
of
me
before
i
have
no
desire
for
any
change
in
griselda
even
for
the
better
i
have
been
successful
however
i
am
bound
to
record
i
have
found
an
outdoor
school
for
ranny
and
laura
in
macdougal
street
near
washington
square
and
a
nearby
kindergarten
for
jimmie
the
girl
alicia
is
able
to
take
ranny
and
laura
to
macdougal
street
on
the
way
to
her
own
public
school
jimmie
who
does
not
go
until
later
in
the
morning
is
a
problem
thus
far
i
have
been
conducting
him
to
his
kindergarten
myself
but
obviously
that
can
not
continue
despite
the
fact
that
jimmie
seeing
his
elder
brother
depart
with
two
girls
turns
to
me
with
a
look
of
inimitable
superiority
and
observes
we
men
must
stick
together
we
uncle
ranny
i
gravely
agree
with
him
on
the
general
policy
though
i
aim
to
forestall
future
trouble
by
indicating
that
expediency
often
governs
these
things
the
term
bills
paid
in
advance
to
the
schools
have
left
a
gap
in
my
exchequer
for
the
first
time
i
have
been
compelled
to
decline
a
genuine
bargain
andrews
the
bookseller
called
me
up
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
something
i
could
not
resist
laughing
i
asked
him
to
name
it
it
is
nothing
less
than
he
told
me
with
particular
solemnity
first
edition
with
the
misprint
on
page
beautiful
copy
dated
april
dated
april
he
repeated
with
impressive
triumph
my
heart
sank
though
it
was
beating
loudly
for
many
years
i
have
had
an
order
for
that
boswell
and
the
price
i
murmured
faintly
for
you
he
said
four
hundred
dollars
griselda
would
approve
of
me
blatantly
did
she
know
the
courage
it
required
to
answer
andrews
no
friend
i
am
sorry
but
i
can
not
afford
it
at
present
andrews
was
incredulous
do
i
hear
you
correctly
he
queried
accurately
i
told
him
if
you
hear
that
i
take
it
then
i
refuse
to
accept
the
evidence
of
my
ears
he
retorted
with
spirit
i
shall
send
it
down
to
you
i
told
him
it
was
useless
oh
you
buy
it
he
shouted
but
i
insist
on
giving
an
old
customer
the
pleasure
of
seeing
it
at
his
leisure
in
his
own
library
a
shrewd
good
devil
is
andrews
even
though
he
is
a
good
salesman
i
have
been
feasting
my
senses
on
the
boswell
but
it
will
have
to
go
back
going
so
abruptly
has
left
me
very
heavy
at
times
upon
my
own
hands
he
had
a
way
of
dropping
in
unannounced
when
you
least
expected
him
so
that
i
came
to
count
upon
him
at
unexpected
moments
there
is
no
one
to
take
his
place
now
on
clear
evenings
i
ramble
aimlessly
northward
and
often
turn
in
at
the
club
though
so
little
have
i
been
a
frequenter
of
it
i
hardly
know
a
soul
in
the
place
last
night
i
ran
into
my
classmate
fred
salmon
for
the
first
time
in
months
fred
is
i
should
say
my
exact
antithesis
he
is
full
of
laughter
and
noise
and
exuberance
riches
are
his
goal
in
life
and
if
he
expended
one
half
the
vitality
on
the
acquisition
of
riches
that
he
devotes
to
the
collection
of
humorous
anecdotes
he
would
be
a
wealthy
man
hello
ranny
he
shouted
when
he
saw
me
just
in
time
to
join
me
in
a
little
refreshment
what
you
doing
now
luckily
he
seldom
waits
for
an
answer
with
trained
rapidity
he
gave
his
order
to
a
waiter
and
continued
come
across
any
rare
editions
lately
any
fine
copies
such
as
or
by
gazook
no
i
told
him
my
collection
is
lacking
in
those
masterpieces
tell
you
what
you
ought
to
be
ranny
he
boomed
as
the
waiter
put
down
the
glasses
you
ought
to
be
how
bond
salesman
he
decided
after
a
pause
and
gulped
down
his
liquor
or
else
a
dog
fancier
why
those
exalted
callings
i
asked
with
only
the
mildest
curiosity
you
are
such
a
simp
and
you
look
so
damn
honest
he
elucidated
that
anybody
would
believe
anything
you
say
then
will
you
believe
me
if
i
say
i
want
to
be
either
of
those
anything
else
oh
sure
he
responded
heartily
i
know
that
all
right
you
got
anything
on
me
rather
own
a
few
good
horses
and
follow
the
races
round
the
tracks
of
the
world
if
i
had
my
choice
instead
of
which
got
to
separate
the
world
from
enough
dollars
to
keep
me
going
if
ever
you
get
hard
up
ran
he
concluded
reflectively
let
me
know
set
you
up
in
the
right
game
never
make
a
mistake
i
took
a
course
in
character
reading
for
five
how
i
know
so
much
dollars
dollars
dollars
must
every
one
then
become
merely
a
machine
i
remember
fred
in
college
ruddy
with
the
freshness
of
youth
when
he
was
making
jokes
for
the
and
so
abundant
was
his
energy
everybody
expected
him
to
do
great
things
and
now
he
can
talk
of
nothing
but
he
seem
to
be
oversupplied
with
those
i
am
nothing
myself
but
at
least
no
one
expected
anything
of
me
fred
proposed
that
we
play
a
game
of
poker
bridge
checkers
or
cribbage
but
as
none
of
those
manly
sports
tempted
me
at
the
moment
we
parted
and
he
cordially
informed
me
that
he
would
look
me
up
one
day
nevertheless
with
all
his
noise
and
emptiness
fred
was
glowing
or
seemed
to
be
glowing
to
me
his
ideas
are
puerile
his
talk
is
cast
in
one
mold
upon
one
design
that
of
evoking
laughter
but
he
is
alive
he
is
not
apathetic
that
is
what
i
deplore
in
myself
the
apathy
that
has
saturated
me
after
the
recent
events
that
are
like
a
dark
liquid
which
has
entered
my
mind
at
one
point
and
then
by
natural
action
unchecked
has
stained
every
fiber
of
my
being
it
is
not
thus
i
shall
acquit
myself
of
the
task
i
have
assumed
i
must
become
alive
the
children
i
am
beginning
to
think
are
the
only
creatures
really
alive
in
this
world
they
hanker
after
first
editions
after
knowledge
of
bygone
old
worthies
like
ser
brunetto
some
seven
centuries
dead
nor
yet
after
the
eternal
conversion
of
life
into
dollars
i
witnessed
a
curious
excrescence
of
their
bubbling
imaginations
my
door
standing
open
i
was
able
to
observe
a
ceremony
that
transformed
my
dining
room
into
a
church
and
the
four
infants
with
solemn
faces
into
the
vivid
celebrants
of
the
sacrament
of
marriage
they
are
evidently
ignorant
of
the
alderman
method
to
the
delight
of
jimmie
and
laura
ranny
my
oldest
nephew
with
hieratic
pomp
was
being
married
to
the
girl
alicia
even
she
knew
better
than
to
laugh
as
the
boy
was
slipping
a
ring
upon
her
finger
murmuring
some
gibberish
which
he
had
either
learned
or
invented
and
endowing
her
with
all
his
worldly
goods
the
goods
consisted
first
of
all
in
the
number
of
a
hundred
kisses
which
the
boy
proceeded
to
administer
with
savage
realism
to
the
crowing
delight
of
jimmie
and
the
uncontrollable
giggling
of
laura
this
part
of
the
endowment
being
finally
completed
he
brought
forth
from
his
pocket
a
small
toy
pistol
and
gravely
placed
it
in
her
hand
i
nearly
jumped
from
my
chair
when
i
saw
that
a
pistol
of
all
things
what
could
have
made
the
little
apes
think
of
that
what
a
text
for
a
cynic
perhaps
every
bride
ought
to
receive
a
pistol
as
part
of
her
wedding
dower
they
then
proceeded
merrily
to
eat
bits
of
cake
and
to
laugh
and
chatter
like
any
other
wedding
guests
i
closed
my
door
softly
and
for
a
space
i
was
lost
in
reflection
for
it
suddenly
came
to
me
that
to
approach
life
with
anything
less
than
the
playful
zest
of
children
was
a
grim
a
fatal
error
it
was
odd
that
gertrude
should
have
chosen
that
hour
to
evince
the
only
sign
since
her
decision
that
she
had
any
memory
of
me
when
she
came
in
preceded
by
the
knock
and
laconic
announcement
of
griselda
the
first
words
she
spoke
were
well
ranny
and
how
is
domesticity
highly
educative
i
told
her
as
i
ministered
to
her
usual
wants
i
have
just
learned
the
proper
way
of
marrying
a
woman
indeed
murmured
gertrude
somewhat
sourly
i
thought
and
how
is
that
not
the
alderman
that
is
important
i
informed
her
done
with
a
hundred
kisses
and
a
pistol
in
reply
to
her
look
of
incomprehension
i
described
to
her
the
episode
of
the
dining
room
to
my
surprise
gertrude
could
see
no
humor
in
that
what
a
child
you
are
ranny
she
shook
her
head
sadly
and
i
thought
that
with
all
your
faults
you
were
a
serious
person
that
must
have
been
your
fundamental
mistake
about
me
i
answered
somewhat
sheepishly
and
yet
nettled
i
fear
i
am
not
half
as
serious
as
the
children
are
no
said
gertrude
then
after
a
brief
pause
have
you
decided
yet
that
the
children
ought
to
be
sent
away
to
schools
why
no
gertrude
such
a
thing
has
not
entered
my
head
we
talked
of
it
i
told
her
ranny
she
solemnly
leaned
forward
i
think
i
know
troubling
you
you
be
so
foolishly
proud
with
me
a
question
of
money
i
take
it
well
ready
to
help
out
with
their
bills
i
know
these
things
are
expensive
i
am
willing
to
set
aside
part
of
my
income
for
their
bills
we
could
arrange
that
part
of
it
somehow
why
you
foolish
boy
you
take
me
into
your
confidence
it
all
i
stammered
why
you
the
children
themselves
how
can
i
throw
them
over
you
think
doing
anything
for
them
and
this
girl
who
comes
from
goodness
knows
what
parents
better
let
me
manage
curiously
i
felt
offended
at
her
speaking
thus
of
the
girl
alicia
who
seems
as
integrally
a
part
of
my
charge
and
household
as
any
of
the
rest
very
good
of
you
gertrude
i
muttered
to
offer
so
much
but
to
take
money
from
you
for
my
children
of
the
question
this
put
her
more
than
ever
out
of
temper
i
never
knew
any
one
quite
so
idiotic
she
retorted
caustically
you
can
do
nothing
yourself
and
you
let
anybody
who
can
help
you
and
after
smoking
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
gertrude
turned
from
me
in
disgust
very
smartly
dressed
she
was
too
with
a
most
becoming
winter
hat
and
handsome
furs
i
should
like
to
please
gertrude
but
she
seems
unable
to
grasp
my
point
of
view
namely
that
touching
those
children
i
feel
my
responsibility
to
be
personal
if
only
some
one
nearer
to
them
than
myself
turned
up
i
murmured
abjectly
see
me
bundling
them
out
so
quick
it
would
make
their
little
heads
buzz
nearer
she
repeated
vaguely
when
you
know
there
is
no
such
person
their
father
for
instance
i
explained
i
have
no
reason
to
think
him
dead
laura
had
always
felt
certain
he
was
alive
there
are
all
sorts
of
explanations
possible
for
his
absence
he
may
come
back
you
know
gertrude
laughed
at
me
bitterly
the
only
likely
explanation
she
retorted
is
that
he
was
tired
of
his
wife
and
children
he
is
probably
having
a
good
time
somewhere
with
some
one
who
knows
how
to
hold
him
that
was
a
phrase
that
stung
me
why
must
she
slur
my
poor
sister
now
in
her
grave
i
bowed
my
head
but
i
could
not
reply
even
though
i
admit
to
a
feeling
of
gloomy
certainty
that
jim
pendleton
will
never
return
said
gertrude
smiling
grimly
at
me
au
revoir
i
answered
letting
her
out
but
she
paid
no
further
heed
to
me
why
i
should
vent
my
undeniable
irritation
upon
alicia
i
do
not
know
but
i
called
her
into
my
study
as
soon
as
gertrude
had
gone
and
she
entered
smiling
brightly
the
child
i
believe
looks
considerably
happier
than
she
did
when
first
she
came
here
and
her
eyes
are
less
wistful
i
was
conscious
of
the
sternness
of
a
hanging
judge
upon
my
visage
but
alicia
ignored
my
mood
possibly
she
has
found
me
out
and
knows
that
i
am
least
to
be
feared
when
in
appearance
most
despotic
alicia
i
began
severely
how
are
the
children
getting
on
are
they
all
right
what
an
imbecile
query
oh
yes
sir
she
wonderingly
answered
i
they
happy
here
i
scowled
at
her
yes
think
lovely
are
they
afraid
of
me
i
demanded
austerely
looking
grimly
at
my
finger
nails
sir
she
stammered
are
not
i
was
terrifying
the
child
i
realized
with
a
pang
but
when
i
looked
up
suddenly
the
little
vixen
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
that
can
hardly
be
she
had
the
manners
to
turn
away
an
attaching
little
baggage
is
this
child
but
have
no
nonsense
and
i
pulled
her
up
sharply
too
sharply
perhaps
whereat
i
grinned
in
do
you
feel
competent
to
go
on
taking
care
of
them
oh
she
suspicion
of
laughter
i
just
love
not
thinking
sending
me
away
after
all
mr
byrd
there
was
a
catch
in
the
poor
voice
and
i
felt
stupid
and
brutal
i
growled
judicially
not
at
all
i
merely
wanted
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
trouble
of
any
sort
i
suggest
that
you
report
to
me
every
day
or
two
upon
anything
that
occurs
to
you
think
i
ought
to
know
yes
sir
she
faltered
i
will
sir
have
they
clothes
and
shoes
and
enough
for
this
weather
oh
yes
she
answered
smiling
again
and
you
have
you
everything
you
need
why
yes
think
i
have
her
shoes
seemed
thin
and
worn
i
was
in
no
mood
to
be
superficial
or
evasive
are
those
the
best
shoes
you
have
yes
sir
she
answered
faintly
her
calico
frock
also
seemed
extremely
thin
that
is
all
i
dismissed
her
curtly
ask
griselda
to
come
to
me
please
griselda
i
began
genial
enough
to
one
that
is
not
in
awe
of
me
i
wish
you
would
look
over
the
girl
wardrobe
and
get
her
whatever
she
needs
in
the
way
of
shoes
and
things
would
you
mind
doing
that
ay
do
it
randolph
i
know
some
cheap
places
in
fourteenth
heaven
forbid
griselda
i
interrupted
her
i
have
that
there
is
enough
inequality
and
in
the
world
without
putting
it
among
children
no
no
buy
the
things
where
you
bought
the
miss
children
griselda
laughed
hoarsely
not
begin
ruining
the
lassie
with
gaudy
clothes
she
exclaimed
no
griselda
not
good
clothes
have
never
yet
ruined
anybody
i
gave
her
as
my
genuine
conviction
the
other
way
about
poor
clothes
eat
at
the
vitals
of
your
like
the
fox
in
the
tale
of
the
spartan
lad
have
ye
gone
into
the
bills
for
the
clothes
for
the
bairns
she
flung
at
me
not
yet
i
answered
mildly
but
make
a
walking
tour
through
them
one
of
these
days
walk
backwards
when
you
do
thinking
flung
out
griselda
and
disappeared
muttering
in
lexicon
extravagance
is
synonymous
with
crime
and
even
outtops
it
but
she
is
certain
to
do
as
i
ask
there
was
a
book
auction
and
two
days
having
elapsed
since
my
interview
with
gertrude
i
was
sufficiently
myself
when
i
lay
down
the
paper
announcing
it
to
think
of
going
the
news
of
an
auction
still
has
the
effect
upon
me
that
a
bugle
might
exert
upon
some
battered
superannuated
cavalry
horse
despite
the
rise
of
the
plutocratic
collector
despite
the
shoals
of
dealers
who
have
made
of
almost
an
exact
science
i
still
dream
of
encountering
one
day
the
fortune
of
edward
malone
who
late
in
the
eighteenth
century
bought
sonnets
in
the
edition
of
and
a
first
printing
of
the
rape
of
lucrece
all
for
two
guineas
i
had
already
conducted
jimmie
to
his
kindergarten
on
the
way
as
he
nestled
his
hand
more
firmly
in
mine
he
looked
up
at
me
with
a
humorous
smile
and
informed
me
that
we
men
have
times
together
it
gave
me
a
curious
thrill
and
i
felt
grateful
even
for
this
companionship
in
my
solitary
life
which
gertrude
and
so
many
others
find
foolish
and
despicable
i
was
letting
myself
out
at
the
front
door
when
a
plain
young
woman
of
perhaps
thirty
austerely
garbed
in
black
stood
facing
me
i
remained
for
a
moment
bereft
of
speech
and
then
of
course
i
foolishly
apologized
i
know
for
encumbering
the
earth
you
wish
to
see
griselda
i
mumbled
with
my
hat
in
my
hand
no
she
declared
scrutinizing
me
in
the
murky
hallway
i
want
to
see
randolph
byrd
i
am
he
i
told
her
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
mentally
i
waved
a
sad
farewell
to
the
book
auction
and
to
any
bargains
it
might
hold
and
led
the
way
to
my
study
i
am
at
your
service
i
told
her
grinning
and
all
but
offered
her
a
cigarette
about
the
little
girl
alicia
palmer
she
began
hesitantly
as
though
she
had
something
dreadful
to
impart
are
you
her
teacher
i
wonderingly
asked
no
byrd
i
am
from
the
home
for
dependent
am
one
of
the
inspectors
ah
i
see
you
wish
inspect
her
i
blundered
on
stupidly
whereat
she
laughed
exactly
she
smiled
to
tell
the
truth
byrd
i
wish
to
inspect
well
this
is
all
there
is
of
me
i
broke
in
and
i
want
she
added
to
take
her
back
to
the
home
take
her
back
i
cried
stung
by
something
in
her
tone
why
we
allow
our
girls
to
live
in
the
homes
of
bachelors
she
murmured
lowering
her
eyes
for
an
instant
oh
i
gasped
feebly
it
is
my
eternal
wrongness
that
seems
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
everything
the
picture
of
the
children
upon
my
hands
without
the
girl
alicia
swept
me
with
a
chill
dismay
it
ought
to
have
been
reported
to
us
she
said
reprovingly
it
really
ought
what
ought
to
have
been
reported
i
groped
in
bewilderment
the
transfer
we
sent
alicia
to
pendleton
she
explained
when
we
ought
to
have
been
we
could
look
after
her
i
understand
i
murmured
weakly
you
see
my
death
was
so
sudden
that
nobody
thought
of
such
things
i
even
know
she
had
taken
this
girl
from
your
home
in
my
blundering
way
i
then
explained
to
her
how
the
children
came
here
of
their
attachment
to
alicia
and
of
my
own
absurd
dependence
upon
i
abruptly
realized
i
told
her
quite
truthfully
i
believe
that
now
the
children
could
not
get
on
without
her
and
the
bitter
thought
assailed
me
that
nothing
in
this
world
that
is
pleasant
or
fitting
or
agreeable
can
long
be
left
unshattered
that
everything
human
and
sweet
and
tranquil
must
be
by
some
human
hands
undone
what
a
miserably
destructive
race
we
are
well
i
concluded
sadly
i
suppose
now
take
her
what
i
shall
do
with
these
three
children
is
beyond
me
to
my
surprise
as
i
looked
up
i
distinctly
saw
a
tear
glisten
in
her
eye
she
looked
away
you
have
a
great
many
books
she
observed
with
nervous
irrelevance
the
result
of
a
misspent
life
i
sighed
well
i
know
what
to
do
or
say
she
said
rising
awkwardly
like
to
see
alicia
other
children
and
have
to
shall
call
up
the
matron
of
the
home
on
the
telephone
you
do
it
now
i
eagerly
prompted
better
see
alicia
first
i
will
she
be
in
at
lunch
time
i
said
you
stay
or
come
to
lunch
she
seemed
to
recall
that
this
was
that
obscene
environment
the
home
of
a
bachelor
no
thank
you
she
murmured
primly
better
come
again
in
the
afternoon
would
do
all
right
admirably
i
told
her
do
the
very
best
i
can
she
reassured
me
very
good
of
you
i
answered
from
a
grateful
heart
farewell
auctions
farewell
peace
once
again
i
am
in
troubled
waters
predestined
like
a
bit
of
flotsam
to
bob
about
only
in
storm
obscurely
deep
within
me
i
long
for
power
to
do
everything
to
arrange
everything
to
make
my
world
swing
about
me
rhythmically
instead
of
my
lurching
about
it
drunkenly
even
on
this
secret
page
meant
for
no
eyes
but
mine
i
would
pour
out
my
grief
and
tragedy
the
eternal
underlying
sadness
of
then
rise
up
a
man
of
will
and
energy
to
manage
my
affairs
instead
i
can
only
weakly
scribble
ineptitudes
to
while
away
the
time
until
a
poor
underpaid
girl
inspectress
returns
to
pronounce
sentence
upon
me
am
i
or
am
i
not
to
be
allowed
to
live
within
hailing
of
tranquillity
gertrude
i
am
wretchedly
afraid
was
right
after
all
what
business
has
a
manikin
like
myself
to
look
with
bold
eyes
upon
duty
or
to
grapple
with
responsibility
which
an
ordinary
man
would
assume
as
if
adding
another
key
to
his
pocket
and
forget
falstaff
could
not
have
been
more
genial
or
hilarious
than
i
feel
at
this
moment
nor
yet
the
ancient
pistol
when
i
left
the
dining
room
a
few
minutes
ago
my
dignity
would
have
suffered
permanent
eclipse
had
the
children
espied
me
after
i
closed
my
door
i
capered
about
the
room
like
some
rheumatic
goat
lilting
a
wild
melody
the
inspectress
has
pointed
her
thumbs
upward
i
hardly
know
whether
alicia
the
children
or
griselda
decided
the
issue
favorably
do
you
wish
to
see
alicia
alone
i
asked
the
inspectress
when
she
returned
she
will
never
know
that
nice
plain
girl
with
what
tension
i
had
awaited
her
no
lover
she
may
have
had
has
ever
kept
a
tryst
for
her
more
she
would
not
now
be
miss
smith
no
was
her
reply
she
is
only
a
child
i
want
to
see
her
with
the
children
alicia
was
already
prepared
and
i
am
bound
to
admit
partially
primed
here
is
miss
smith
come
to
see
you
alicia
i
announced
with
assumed
lightness
as
i
ushered
the
lady
in
oh
it
was
very
distinctly
ushered
how
do
you
do
alicia
miss
smith
held
out
her
hand
melting
at
the
sight
of
the
children
in
the
midst
of
play
how
are
and
happy
oh
so
happy
answered
alicia
coming
forward
with
flushed
cheeks
i
am
so
glad
you
came
but
why
you
write
us
child
was
the
gentle
remonstrance
i
am
awfully
sorry
miss
smith
from
contrite
alicia
but
the
time
passed
so
was
just
going
i
had
to
get
new
there
are
so
many
things
to
do
miss
smith
looked
down
at
clothes
dubiously
perhaps
she
thought
their
quality
too
ruinously
good
for
one
of
the
inmates
of
her
home
she
then
glanced
at
the
silent
wondering
children
hello
miss
smith
they
cried
in
broken
chorus
catching
her
eye
it
was
she
who
had
originally
brought
alicia
to
them
you
take
alicia
away
will
you
laura
spoke
up
bravely
why
dear
you
like
to
have
her
go
away
she
returned
smiling
uncertainly
no
we
replied
all
the
children
actually
in
one
voice
with
little
jimmie
loudest
whereat
we
both
laughed
who
demanded
randolph
sternly
will
sew
our
buttons
on
and
give
me
my
baf
cried
jimmie
or
help
us
with
our
lessons
put
in
laura
well
see
miss
smith
came
back
brightly
i
believe
that
young
woman
is
genuinely
fond
of
children
what
are
you
playing
just
now
they
all
began
to
explain
at
once
shall
i
leave
you
with
them
i
murmured
stay
a
minute
or
two
she
i
tiptoed
out
to
await
doom
when
i
returned
a
few
minutes
later
i
heard
to
my
surprise
voice
just
before
i
opened
the
door
rising
to
the
full
height
of
her
indignation
if
this
is
no
fitting
then
nothing
is
whereupon
i
opened
the
door
the
children
had
disappeared
griselda
with
flashing
eyes
was
literally
towering
over
poor
miss
smith
evidently
griselda
had
been
bearing
testimony
most
excellent
witness
griselda
what
chance
had
any
miss
smith
against
a
rock
of
sheer
personality
like
griselda
all
right
miss
smith
announced
smiling
faintly
as
i
entered
i
called
up
the
matron
this
noon
and
she
left
it
in
my
hands
this
is
an
first
of
its
kind
in
our
i
mean
to
let
alicia
stay
seems
so
happy
here
she
added
faltering
very
gracious
of
you
i
bowed
i
thank
you
shall
them
your
decision
griselda
opened
the
door
of
the
bedroom
where
they
all
had
been
cooped
up
like
so
many
frightened
little
hares
and
randolph
unable
to
contain
himself
demanded
eagerly
can
she
stay
yes
nodded
miss
smith
and
wild
shouts
must
have
shattered
the
nerves
of
the
other
tenants
jimmie
as
a
mark
of
highest
favor
ran
to
miss
smith
and
held
forth
his
arms
to
be
taken
up
into
hers
he
could
not
bestow
a
greater
confidence
alicia
dabbed
some
happy
tears
from
her
cheeks
i
begged
miss
smith
to
stay
to
tea
with
them
and
unobtrusively
escaped
now
my
mind
is
agog
with
triumphant
imaginings
if
ever
i
become
president
griselda
of
a
certainty
shall
be
my
secretary
of
state
now
that
the
christmas
holidays
have
passed
and
i
have
been
casting
up
accounts
the
uneasy
knowledge
has
come
to
me
that
i
am
no
longer
living
on
my
income
the
freshet
of
bills
is
surging
about
me
yet
perhaps
i
have
been
improvident
but
i
have
not
bought
a
book
in
ages
andrews
the
bookseller
informed
me
the
other
day
with
an
expression
more
of
sorrow
than
of
anger
that
though
he
comprehend
my
unaccountable
refusal
of
the
boswell
he
had
not
the
heart
to
offer
it
to
any
one
else
he
was
holding
it
still
he
declared
in
order
to
spare
a
friend
regrets
sell
it
andrews
for
it
i
told
him
but
had
your
order
in
for
three
years
he
protested
and
never
canceled
it
now
suddenly
you
refuse
it
that
must
mean
something
it
tell
you
what
it
means
andrews
i
have
acquired
a
young
family
i
then
briefly
explained
to
him
my
situation
you
tell
me
tell
me
he
repeated
over
and
over
then
this
is
what
i
do
he
announced
with
a
sudden
ferocity
of
decision
i
hold
that
work
if
i
have
to
hold
it
for
ten
years
until
such
a
time
as
you
feel
you
can
take
it
only
i
am
so
short
of
room
here
he
added
blandly
will
you
not
store
it
for
me
on
your
shelves
why
samaritan
i
laughed
in
my
embarrassment
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
what
are
you
trying
to
a
bankrupt
of
me
if
you
will
include
it
under
your
he
but
never
mind
insure
it
myself
and
then
he
talked
of
something
else
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
before
i
reached
home
that
boswell
was
here
and
is
now
on
my
shelves
i
have
been
gloating
over
that
epic
of
personality
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
johnson
and
griselda
are
kindred
of
the
spirit
two
months
it
is
incredible
years
must
have
passed
since
the
children
have
come
here
my
past
life
seems
remote
as
ancient
egypt
this
morning
came
a
letter
from
biagi
of
the
laurentian
asking
why
he
did
not
hear
from
me
when
was
i
coming
to
florence
and
adding
that
at
oxford
also
some
brunetto
latini
material
has
been
recently
unearthed
and
that
i
might
stop
on
the
way
and
examine
it
i
laughed
gone
are
those
days
never
i
fear
to
return
if
only
i
could
smell
a
good
old
parchment
once
again
i
still
remember
the
thrill
i
felt
when
biagi
first
showed
me
the
vellum
script
of
sophocles
at
the
laurentian
i
could
actually
see
the
scribe
in
the
byzantium
of
the
eleventh
century
reverently
copying
the
lofty
beautiful
words
in
a
spirit
of
high
worship
his
pale
cheeks
flushed
with
his
pious
task
i
that
scribe
why
i
ask
was
that
strange
and
eager
feeling
implanted
in
my
particular
bosom
could
it
be
that
in
some
past
age
i
was
myself
the
scholarly
greek
that
is
nonsense
if
only
i
could
pay
my
bills
yet
i
dare
not
touch
the
trifle
laura
left
to
her
children
that
must
remain
for
emergency
and
on
may
first
we
must
change
our
quarters
the
renting
agent
a
decent
enough
little
person
was
very
apologetic
i
have
kids
myself
he
informed
me
deprecatingly
and
i
know
what
it
is
but
you
understand
a
bachelor
is
one
thing
and
four
children
is
quite
another
makes
a
difference
i
told
him
that
i
was
more
or
less
aware
of
the
difference
it
made
and
these
people
here
in
this
here
now
building
he
explained
so
nasty
stand
the
sight
of
a
kid
let
alone
the
sound
i
made
no
comment
for
too
recently
had
i
been
just
so
we
shall
have
to
seek
some
pastures
new
fred
salmon
as
good
as
his
word
has
actually
looked
me
up
i
know
why
the
mere
entry
of
that
breezy
mohock
into
the
room
brought
my
unwilling
fatherhood
into
a
relief
ten
times
sharper
than
i
had
felt
it
before
i
suddenly
felt
myself
a
gawk
and
a
failure
before
a
man
of
the
though
i
did
not
wholly
respect
the
man
of
the
world
once
more
i
was
acutely
aware
of
lost
freedom
abstract
freedom
out
of
which
i
had
stepped
as
a
man
steps
from
life
into
death
luckily
fred
is
not
one
to
beat
about
the
bush
you
remember
he
began
skillfully
rotating
the
mutilated
end
of
a
cigar
between
his
teeth
my
telling
you
at
the
club
the
kind
of
business
be
suited
for
a
bond
salesman
or
a
dog
fancier
i
answered
promptly
have
you
gone
into
anything
i
replied
in
the
negative
well
thinking
of
starting
something
he
announced
solemnly
a
dog
kennel
i
queried
bond
business
ran
i
wish
you
luck
my
boy
i
told
him
none
of
he
grinned
i
want
you
to
go
in
with
me
i
gazed
at
him
in
speechless
astonishment
have
i
said
a
bellyful
he
demanded
removing
his
vile
cigar
i
gasped
and
more
ha
the
way
i
am
he
laughed
ideas
come
to
me
and
i
act
upon
them
have
i
i
began
stammering
to
deserve
the
man
for
my
money
he
erupted
boisterously
i
sometimes
make
a
mistake
in
picking
a
horse
but
never
in
picking
a
man
ranny
my
boy
never
when
henry
the
fowler
was
tranquilly
snaring
finches
and
news
was
suddenly
brought
him
that
he
had
been
elected
emperor
i
doubt
whether
he
had
felt
more
completely
graveled
than
did
i
at
that
moment
but
to
be
serious
with
fred
salmon
was
just
then
beyond
me
you
have
come
to
the
right
man
this
time
fred
i
gave
him
back
a
parody
of
his
own
tone
not
a
doubt
of
it
you
bet
i
have
old
hoss
he
cried
i
know
it
that
is
i
went
on
if
fitness
training
experience
capacity
predilection
and
abundance
of
capital
are
factors
you
have
selected
the
one
yah
broke
in
fred
i
know
all
about
that
try
the
sarcastic
with
me
old
boy
i
know
all
you
can
say
and
a
darn
sight
more
but
i
told
you
the
cut
of
your
mug
i
want
what
good
is
the
best
trained
old
if
a
with
a
man
as
with
a
horse
got
the
right
look
to
what
counts
the
mockery
of
my
thanks
and
all
further
attempts
at
clumsy
satire
were
utterly
ignored
by
fred
comfortably
fixed
i
know
he
said
ruminatively
scanning
my
books
which
curiously
suggest
wealth
to
every
one
but
dash
it
all
man
you
must
want
more
money
for
something
or
books
maybe
everybody
wants
more
something
i
know
he
ran
on
it
every
fellah
makes
up
his
mind
on
the
dot
the
way
i
do
got
to
turn
it
over
in
your
bean
i
suppose
all
right
but
take
no
for
answer
with
that
trifling
limitation
i
assume
i
have
a
wide
liberty
of
choice
i
ventured
oh
yes
he
grinned
outside
the
fact
that
coming
in
you
can
go
as
far
as
you
like
salmon
and
byrd
he
exclaimed
suddenly
that
for
a
firm
name
by
gosh
genius
in
it
may
have
been
that
which
was
driving
me
to
you
i
never
go
wrong
salmon
and
so
good
it
scares
me
salmon
and
byrd
i
repeated
after
him
mechanically
the
strikes
me
as
incomplete
for
a
like
you
add
a
little
shrimp
at
least
an
artichoke
he
grinned
but
he
would
none
of
my
flippancy
no
no
he
wagged
his
head
none
of
that
spoil
a
fine
thing
do
they
call
a
good
firm
half
the
battle
by
george
this
has
been
a
work
for
me
i
know
it
was
going
to
be
so
rich
we
ought
to
have
a
dinner
on
it
at
the
what
say
in
a
flash
i
saw
the
vista
of
life
spread
out
before
and
laughter
ventripotent
bouts
with
costly
dishes
in
expensive
places
tinkling
world
of
which
consists
as
much
in
riotous
expenditure
as
in
getting
it
was
to
this
world
that
fred
was
inviting
me
there
will
be
supper
at
six
if
you
care
to
stay
i
suggested
mildly
thanks
said
fred
reflectively
like
to
but
somehow
not
i
better
come
along
with
me
and
work
out
details
i
resisted
his
urging
however
and
he
left
me
with
this
parthian
arrow
think
it
over
as
much
as
you
like
randolph
my
boy
but
a
go
nothing
you
can
say
against
it
will
hold
a
candle
to
the
reasons
in
favor
the
firm
name
alone
is
worth
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
consider
it
settled
never
felt
so
sure
of
anything
in
all
my
life
so
long
my
boy
hear
from
me
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
when
he
heard
my
burst
of
almost
hysterical
laughter
as
he
was
closing
the
door
always
heretofore
i
had
counted
myself
how
humble
and
insignificant
soever
as
of
the
priesthood
in
the
temple
of
fine
things
it
was
abasing
to
think
that
fred
had
claimed
me
for
the
never
again
do
i
wish
to
experience
the
martyred
minutes
of
anguish
that
i
have
passed
through
during
the
last
hours
for
some
reason
that
none
can
explain
jimmie
suddenly
came
down
with
a
fever
that
bright
little
whorl
of
life
all
at
once
looked
white
refused
his
food
with
the
pallid
pitiful
smile
of
an
octogenarian
and
in
a
twinkling
it
seemed
his
cheeks
were
burning
his
eyes
glittered
dryly
and
his
lips
were
parched
called
to
his
bedside
i
leaned
over
him
and
the
air
about
me
seemed
to
darken
child
was
i
believed
dangerously
ill
the
heart
within
me
turned
leaden
and
even
griselda
displayed
alarm
then
and
there
i
vowed
inwardly
that
no
strangers
should
have
the
care
of
this
child
if
he
recovered
so
long
as
i
could
care
for
him
myself
the
nearest
doctor
who
occupies
a
apartment
below
a
brute
of
a
man
of
or
so
elected
when
he
came
up
to
look
wise
and
inscrutable
calm
and
grave
he
prescribed
oil
and
with
a
murmured
we
shall
see
in
the
morning
he
left
me
in
an
agony
of
doubt
and
anxiety
the
only
person
who
exhibited
any
degree
of
calm
was
alicia
and
though
she
is
still
a
child
herself
i
confess
to
a
feeling
of
resentment
against
what
seemed
to
me
callousness
in
the
face
of
our
perturbation
i
saw
visions
of
any
number
of
diseases
of
being
quarantined
of
possible
death
of
my
bearing
forevermore
a
feeling
of
nameless
guilt
before
memory
i
told
them
i
should
sit
up
the
night
oh
no
byrd
insisted
the
girl
with
sudden
vehemence
do
that
make
up
a
place
in
the
dining
room
and
leave
the
door
of
their
room
open
hear
him
if
he
wakes
afraid
alicia
you
take
this
seriously
enough
i
told
her
sternly
she
looked
at
me
wistfully
for
a
moment
and
then
faintly
smiled
yes
sir
i
do
she
answered
but
no
use
our
all
wearing
ourselves
out
at
once
if
real
sickness
but
i
think
anything
much
how
can
you
know
i
demanded
suspiciously
i
just
think
so
she
asserted
at
the
home
children
were
always
coming
down
like
this
the
next
day
they
were
as
well
as
ever
again
but
this
is
not
the
home
i
retorted
severely
the
girl
flushed
i
saw
i
had
hurt
her
but
a
child
she
insisted
doggedly
in
a
low
voice
i
shook
my
head
i
shall
sit
up
in
the
study
i
told
her
with
the
door
open
i
shall
hear
him
if
he
calls
better
go
to
bed
her
great
haunting
eyes
looked
at
me
for
an
instant
and
she
left
me
in
the
study
i
lighted
a
fire
drew
up
the
large
chair
lighted
a
cigarette
and
in
dressing
gown
and
slippers
composed
myself
for
the
night
determined
to
spend
it
waking
in
my
mind
were
revolving
many
things
fred
absurd
proposal
the
strange
trick
of
circumstances
that
had
suddenly
made
me
responsible
for
a
houseful
of
children
the
whereabouts
of
dibdin
the
amazing
multiplicity
of
bills
the
little
burning
fever
drowsiness
began
to
assault
my
eyelids
before
the
glowing
fire
to
combat
it
i
took
down
that
sonata
in
words
the
nigger
of
the
narcissus
and
reread
the
description
of
the
cape
storm
which
is
not
a
description
so
much
as
the
expression
of
the
storm
itself
as
always
in
reading
that
book
i
was
overawed
to
the
point
of
pain
by
what
language
can
do
and
pondering
upon
that
i
allowed
myself
to
doze
off
for
a
few
seconds
suddenly
i
awoke
with
a
tremor
and
looked
at
my
watch
to
my
amazement
it
was
six
in
the
morning
abjectly
guilty
i
stole
out
and
tiptoed
into
the
dining
room
the
light
was
burning
i
saw
three
chairs
with
a
crumpled
pillow
upon
them
and
alicia
smiling
drowsily
was
gliding
out
of
the
room
how
is
he
now
i
asked
in
a
muffled
tone
thinking
basely
to
give
her
the
idea
that
i
had
watched
the
night
through
sleeping
quietly
was
the
reply
his
fever
is
mostly
gone
splendid
i
murmured
sheepishly
you
are
you
i
just
lay
here
on
these
chairs
she
answered
quietly
i
looked
in
at
jimmie
about
every
half
hour
he
had
a
very
good
night
with
a
sharp
pang
of
annoyance
mingled
with
relief
i
felt
myself
stark
and
unmasked
we
gazed
at
each
other
in
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
i
broke
into
muffled
laughter
in
which
she
softly
joined
and
though
i
felt
myself
a
fool
i
vow
i
could
have
hugged
that
child
to
my
heart
of
hearts
for
her
sense
of
humor
no
less
than
for
her
silent
unfailing
constancy
like
sunlight
after
storm
recovery
is
making
the
apartment
ring
again
and
when
it
rings
too
much
i
close
my
door
i
close
my
door
but
not
upon
the
bills
these
keep
pouring
in
with
the
insistent
buzzing
of
a
swarm
of
hornets
and
every
day
i
see
them
with
a
more
helpless
dismay
i
figure
and
i
add
and
i
calculate
but
i
seem
unable
to
subtract
i
can
not
see
how
we
could
do
without
the
things
that
are
bought
already
my
modest
current
account
is
near
the
point
of
exhaustion
and
nothing
can
possibly
come
in
before
april
in
my
perplexity
i
took
an
elevated
train
and
journeyed
southward
into
the
region
of
money
what
i
should
do
there
i
hardly
knew
but
a
nameless
inner
necessity
seemed
to
be
driving
me
to
do
something
i
had
a
vague
notion
of
consulting
with
carmichael
but
when
i
came
into
lower
broadway
and
was
actually
at
door
i
fled
in
disgust
with
myself
for
the
sufficiently
transparent
reason
that
i
really
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
i
felt
like
a
debutant
pickpocket
who
turns
back
abruptly
from
the
threshold
of
his
calling
because
he
realizes
the
absence
of
a
vocation
or
is
overcome
by
cowardice
in
the
street
i
looked
upon
the
driving
masses
of
people
swarming
streaming
with
strained
faces
urged
on
by
invisible
whips
of
need
of
desire
driven
like
the
souls
in
hell
by
demoniac
powers
who
ever
cry
pay
your
way
pay
your
way
they
did
not
hear
the
cry
now
the
continual
snapping
of
the
infernal
whips
but
i
heard
them
and
i
quaked
inwardly
to
myself
i
fancied
the
most
of
these
surging
figures
upon
a
level
of
life
that
has
few
problems
that
is
always
happy
with
the
dull
unexultant
happiness
of
the
slave
or
the
captive
coming
briskly
to
the
office
of
a
morning
with
a
sort
of
tarnished
metallic
gayety
lunching
at
or
at
a
counter
unprovided
with
stools
clinging
to
a
strap
in
a
car
jammed
with
their
kind
visiting
a
palace
in
the
evening
and
living
within
their
incomes
because
they
must
and
though
all
the
rest
was
abhorrent
that
last
detail
made
me
envy
them
pay
your
way
pay
your
way
the
cry
was
beating
in
my
pulses
as
i
came
away
droning
in
the
car
wheels
as
i
traveled
northward
dully
insistent
in
the
very
noises
of
the
streets
about
me
once
within
my
own
door
the
warmth
enveloped
me
like
summer
air
and
with
the
warmth
came
the
joyous
laughter
of
the
children
playing
in
the
dining
room
in
a
bubbling
of
happy
turbulence
they
came
rushing
toward
me
as
i
looked
in
upon
them
demanding
that
i
judge
between
them
on
the
rules
of
their
game
just
because
a
girl
complained
randolph
loudly
indicating
laura
she
always
wants
to
be
queen
it
because
a
girl
broke
in
laura
panting
because
fair
boys
never
want
to
be
fair
uncle
ranny
the
matter
been
king
for
half
an
hour
and
he
always
wants
us
to
do
impossible
things
so
he
can
be
king
forever
and
i
want
to
be
king
too
loudly
proclaimed
jimmie
i
suppressed
the
nascent
revolt
as
best
i
could
and
soothed
the
passions
of
pretenders
i
reminded
them
that
this
was
a
democracy
and
that
royalty
in
our
land
could
count
only
upon
a
welcome
aw
i
know
said
randolph
fiercely
i
be
really
truly
king
for
anything
it
was
a
pleasure
to
me
to
enter
from
the
turmoil
of
the
outer
world
to
this
playing
fountain
of
affectionate
young
life
jimmie
laura
randolph
little
glimmers
of
personality
were
fitfully
flickering
over
their
childish
heads
and
it
was
my
task
to
turn
them
into
steady
flames
that
was
what
i
owed
to
my
sister
laura
and
that
was
the
course
upon
which
i
was
irrevocably
embarked
but
now
alone
in
my
study
i
still
hear
in
the
hum
and
rumor
of
the
streets
the
insistent
imperative
cry
pay
your
way
pay
your
way
the
incredible
has
happened
no
not
the
incredible
the
incredible
is
always
happening
it
is
the
impossible
that
has
taken
place
i
randolph
byrd
am
now
a
business
priest
of
the
temple
but
a
brazen
as
ever
was
the
hum
and
the
noise
and
rattle
of
it
are
perpetually
in
my
ears
like
the
whirr
of
machinery
in
the
brain
of
the
factory
hand
i
can
not
think
or
put
myself
in
the
moods
of
thought
the
sound
of
the
ticker
is
constantly
in
my
head
and
my
nerves
crave
movement
fred
salmon
has
accomplished
his
will
you
must
stir
it
and
stump
it
and
blow
your
own
trumpet
is
his
motto
and
he
is
teaching
me
to
blow
the
firm
of
salmon
and
byrd
is
an
actuality
and
clownishly
fred
is
making
the
most
of
the
humor
of
the
name
and
doing
his
best
to
make
me
abet
him
i
say
fred
has
accomplished
it
all
but
at
the
bottom
it
is
children
who
are
innocently
the
primal
cause
of
my
debâcle
know
what
you
are
fred
shot
at
me
in
a
flash
of
is
dowered
with
a
fecundity
of
flashes
these
days
you
are
the
original
old
man
who
lived
in
a
shoe
the
kids
that
made
you
get
into
the
game
gosh
i
wish
we
could
get
that
fact
on
our
letterhead
with
fred
to
think
of
an
idiotic
notion
is
to
utter
and
commit
it
and
i
live
in
constant
dread
lest
some
of
our
customers
and
clients
a
sporadic
body
as
yet
should
inquire
as
to
the
children
with
which
i
know
not
what
to
do
fred
is
an
elizabethan
in
the
spacious
days
he
would
have
ruffed
and
strutted
and
wenched
and
taken
chances
with
careless
slashing
humor
among
the
best
or
the
worst
of
them
he
is
a
buccaneer
who
can
throw
the
dice
with
jovial
laughter
when
things
loom
blackest
under
the
very
guns
of
disaster
he
is
an
enigma
he
is
in
short
my
exact
opposite
yet
he
has
made
me
his
partner
and
accomplice
i
used
to
think
myself
adamant
but
in
his
hands
i
am
clay
it
is
now
late
in
march
the
cold
blasts
are
often
succeeded
by
genial
days
of
brilliant
sunshine
that
already
promise
the
birth
of
a
new
spring
how
much
i
should
delight
in
the
flower
market
near
the
laurentian
or
in
walking
up
the
hill
toward
fiesole
past
the
florentine
villas
or
strolling
in
the
lungarno
and
across
the
ponte
vecchio
to
san
the
gentle
air
of
fra
absurd
fancies
i
am
in
wintry
new
york
yoked
to
a
broker
or
as
the
letterhead
styles
bankers
and
though
we
have
received
no
cables
as
yet
we
are
equipped
with
a
fascinating
code
cable
address
which
is
sambyrd
there
is
no
end
to
our
grandeur
sambyrd
how
it
all
came
about
is
still
swathed
in
a
sort
of
mystery
for
for
even
now
i
do
see
one
thing
clearly
my
income
was
hopelessly
inadequate
to
the
rearing
of
three
children
and
my
capital
was
already
invaded
with
the
capital
gone
what
was
there
left
for
me
but
addressing
envelopes
the
children
in
a
home
like
that
which
alicia
came
from
and
general
collapse
and
catastrophe
and
then
there
was
enthusiasm
money
said
he
sententiously
is
a
very
simple
matter
it
come
rolling
to
you
of
its
own
accord
but
you
can
get
it
every
one
must
find
his
own
way
this
is
my
and
byrd
will
you
join
me
and
make
it
your
way
too
and
i
struggling
like
a
fish
in
a
net
like
a
bird
in
a
snare
like
any
beast
caught
in
a
trap
could
discern
no
way
of
my
own
but
what
i
demanded
in
a
sort
of
despairing
indignation
can
i
do
at
that
business
you
can
learn
said
fred
and
be
making
something
before
you
know
it
and
as
we
grow
make
more
and
then
i
made
the
startling
discovery
that
there
are
no
parallels
in
life
writers
may
babble
of
types
and
statisticians
of
means
and
averages
and
populations
of
facts
but
i
realized
with
pain
that
with
all
my
books
i
knew
of
no
guide
or
inspiration
the
case
of
every
blessed
one
of
us
is
unique
i
could
think
of
no
one
in
precisely
my
own
circumstances
a
pathetic
dejected
melancholy
overcame
me
at
my
fatal
tardiness
in
learning
that
the
world
like
a
hungry
beast
was
clamoring
for
decisions
decide
decide
decide
it
seems
to
roar
with
slavering
jaws
or
i
devour
you
and
if
you
decide
i
shall
still
devour
you
the
drifters
perish
without
a
struggle
i
had
drifted
heretofore
but
now
i
must
flagellate
the
will
for
a
choice
and
so
i
yielded
the
half
of
my
capital
has
already
gone
into
our
offices
and
if
chairs
desks
and
tables
will
make
for
success
we
shall
both
be
millionaires
there
are
magnificent
leather
sofas
such
as
i
never
dreamed
of
lolling
on
but
discussions
and
transactions
of
money
it
seems
must
be
done
within
walls
padded
with
luxury
money
breeds
money
fred
is
ever
telling
me
and
even
as
bees
are
attracted
by
honey
so
the
opulent
investors
will
flock
to
our
richly
fitted
hive
the
droning
of
the
ticker
and
the
sound
of
a
typewriter
are
the
only
noises
permissible
and
the
smoke
of
cigars
must
be
the
most
fragrant
i
hardly
know
why
i
should
be
ironic
never
before
have
i
derived
so
much
amusement
in
a
short
space
of
time
there
was
the
entrance
of
our
first
customer
signor
visconti
he
came
this
enterprising
milanese
in
response
to
one
of
the
hundreds
of
individual
circular
letters
we
sent
out
to
small
banks
and
investors
on
magnificent
stationery
announcing
our
rare
bargains
in
securities
so
safe
that
the
rock
of
gibraltar
was
pasteboard
by
comparison
so
that
only
the
best
of
government
paper
could
dare
to
crackle
in
their
presence
so
remunerative
visconti
admirably
dressed
came
in
the
young
woman
who
brought
in
his
name
had
been
drilled
not
to
seem
flustered
fred
flushed
purple
with
pleasure
and
executed
a
brief
but
exquisite
war
dance
on
the
rug
tell
him
i
shall
see
him
directly
he
murmured
to
the
young
woman
and
sprawled
on
the
leather
chair
beside
me
in
his
triumph
why
you
see
him
then
i
could
not
help
asking
do
fred
wagged
his
head
mysteriously
must
keep
him
waiting
at
least
a
minute
or
burning
up
to
get
my
talons
into
him
i
laughed
at
him
now
this
is
what
you
do
my
boy
fred
gave
me
quick
instruction
in
the
hushed
voice
of
a
conspirator
a
minute
or
so
after
i
leave
you
you
take
your
hat
and
coat
and
pass
through
the
room
where
talking
to
him
i
notice
you
when
nearly
at
the
door
call
you
back
be
in
a
hurry
but
come
back
introduce
you
to
visconti
then
say
but
loud
enough
for
him
to
hear
going
out
about
those
bonds
you
answer
be
back
about
it
say
can
tell
spifkins
we
can
let
him
have
that
thousand
on
call
at
four
and
three
you
just
nod
quickly
like
a
busy
man
salute
visconti
and
out
you
go
i
go
i
stammered
in
a
daze
you
go
to
a
telephone
booth
downstairs
in
the
lobby
and
you
call
me
up
on
the
wire
and
be
surprised
at
anything
i
say
until
i
hang
up
then
you
can
walk
round
the
block
and
come
back
is
that
clear
clear
as
an
asphalt
pavement
i
answered
in
my
bewilderment
all
right
then
he
grinned
and
left
me
complying
with
his
absurd
charge
nevertheless
i
was
duly
introduced
to
the
italian
banker
from
macdougal
street
and
made
my
way
to
the
telephone
booth
in
the
lobby
of
the
building
below
and
this
is
what
i
heard
in
most
suave
and
ingratiating
tone
oh
not
at
all
glad
to
hear
from
a
customer
ferris
we
can
still
let
you
have
those
bonds
though
in
reality
they
are
sold
to
another
client
but
i
think
we
can
give
him
something
just
as
good
that
will
suit
him
equally
well
yes
that
will
be
all
right
a
hundred
thousand
it
well
ha
better
late
than
never
let
that
bother
you
yes
yes
ferris
send
them
over
to
your
office
as
soon
as
my
partner
comes
back
i
am
a
little
busy
now
with
a
customer
oh
mention
it
mention
it
eh
why
at
the
waldorf
about
five
then
and
he
hung
up
the
receiver
for
a
moment
i
stood
speechless
in
the
steaming
booth
with
the
telephone
receiver
in
my
hands
and
then
i
staggered
out
shaken
by
helpless
laughter
when
i
returned
visconti
smiling
broadly
was
in
the
process
of
being
ushered
out
by
fred
with
warm
exchanges
of
amiabilities
we
all
shook
hands
on
the
threshold
in
a
cordial
flurry
of
busy
enthusiasm
and
a
moment
later
fred
and
i
were
alone
just
sold
that
fine
peach
of
a
guinea
ten
thousand
worth
of
hesperus
power
bonds
chuckled
fred
in
irrepressible
glee
but
where
i
demanded
did
you
get
the
bonds
to
sell
got
them
yet
he
paced
the
room
in
nervous
jubilation
but
get
them
in
a
the
national
city
bank
got
lots
of
over
there
something
dark
and
heavy
and
cold
seemed
to
have
dropped
inside
of
me
upon
the
vital
parts
and
chilled
me
for
an
instant
so
this
is
this
kind
of
a
business
i
muttered
this
is
the
way
this
kind
of
a
business
begins
he
replied
composedly
that
interlude
of
actual
business
after
the
ferocious
activity
of
renting
equipping
and
furnishing
an
office
getting
stationery
printed
and
engraved
installing
a
ticker
making
that
mysterious
body
of
connections
that
was
province
was
sufficiently
exhilarating
to
make
me
accept
it
without
much
scrutiny
after
all
what
could
i
do
this
was
the
furrow
in
which
my
plow
was
set
and
this
i
suppose
is
the
custom
of
the
country
how
i
could
not
help
wonderingly
asking
did
you
land
the
effulgent
visconti
oh
a
good
scout
explained
fred
he
runs
a
banking
house
for
his
fellow
dagoes
in
macdougal
street
he
saw
we
were
new
and
he
likes
to
give
young
fellows
a
chance
he
was
quite
frank
you
see
nothing
for
the
big
houses
to
sell
ten
bonds
or
so
but
he
knows
that
to
us
just
opening
up
it
means
a
lot
more
than
the
commission
it
means
a
sale
oh
a
sport
all
right
that
surprises
me
more
than
i
can
say
i
told
him
there
are
some
brutes
even
in
this
business
growled
fred
and
you
forget
it
do
you
think
i
asked
with
a
twinge
of
shame
he
saw
through
your
telephoning
business
and
that
rigmarole
of
yours
to
me
in
the
booth
damn
if
i
think
he
did
roared
fred
but
never
mind
a
sport
and
some
day
when
big
guns
show
him
that
we
appreciate
his
by
putting
him
on
to
something
if
we
i
felt
as
shamefaced
as
though
we
had
committed
a
felony
yet
i
suppose
that
this
is
the
ordinary
comparatively
innocent
chicane
of
even
honest
business
remnants
of
oriental
chaffering
and
huckstering
that
still
survive
i
am
hoping
we
shall
grow
out
of
it
though
at
times
i
suspect
a
certain
flamboyancy
of
temperament
in
fred
that
makes
him
resort
to
such
shifts
rather
than
not
a
man
who
had
purchased
some
bonds
called
up
and
inquired
whether
we
would
take
them
back
there
was
no
reason
for
offering
anything
but
an
endeavor
to
dispose
of
them
but
instead
his
grandiose
reply
was
why
certainly
we
shall
take
those
bonds
back
as
many
more
of
them
as
got
yes
bring
them
down
by
all
means
once
he
had
hung
up
the
receiver
he
turned
toward
me
with
blank
dismay
muttering
now
what
the
hell
shall
we
do
with
those
things
i
own
to
a
flash
of
genuine
anger
at
his
imbecile
untruthfulness
you
know
what
to
do
i
spluttered
then
why
on
earth
did
you
speak
as
though
you
had
a
dozen
buyers
waiting
in
a
row
because
business
he
tried
to
shout
me
down
that
devil
will
have
more
confidence
in
us
if
we
let
him
go
back
on
his
bargain
than
if
he
made
a
lot
of
money
on
it
you
know
human
nature
not
human
nature
like
that
i
retorted
bitterly
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
do
about
it
get
on
the
telephone
both
of
us
he
spoke
cheerfully
and
each
call
up
as
many
people
as
we
can
and
offer
them
those
bonds
before
that
weak
sister
gets
here
a
desperate
remedy
i
growled
irritably
let
me
see
you
do
it
fred
lighted
a
cigar
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
when
he
turned
his
face
was
suave
and
benignant
he
looked
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
man
about
to
fill
a
row
of
christmas
stockings
then
he
betook
himself
to
the
telephone
in
a
cheerful
friendly
lingering
voice
he
began
to
offer
his
gift
to
one
after
another
of
his
list
as
though
an
inward
and
spiritual
grace
were
moving
him
irresistibly
to
benefaction
his
face
was
on
a
broad
grin
even
under
a
series
of
repeated
refusals
and
i
confess
to
experiencing
a
sort
of
truculent
joy
at
what
i
believed
to
be
his
discomfiture
his
accents
however
never
lost
their
velvety
quality
nor
did
he
betray
by
a
single
note
any
trace
of
disappointment
on
the
contrary
he
was
warming
to
his
work
with
a
keen
gusto
on
a
sudden
the
young
woman
at
the
telephone
outside
informed
him
that
he
was
being
called
he
listened
mr
smith
he
answered
mildly
hello
bringing
us
those
bonds
what
decided
to
keep
them
after
all
well
well
with
a
laugh
the
lord
be
with
you
then
smith
we
could
have
sold
them
ten
times
over
since
you
first
called
me
no
no
it
matter
find
something
else
for
the
others
mighty
wise
hand
that
to
you
no
all
right
come
and
see
us
sir
when
he
turned
away
from
the
telephone
the
perspiration
beaded
his
forehead
and
puffy
cheeks
and
he
grinned
genially
whew
he
whistled
passing
a
handkerchief
over
his
face
that
was
great
fun
but
why
do
they
want
to
break
in
on
the
innocent
morning
with
things
like
that
well
how
it
is
randolph
my
boy
he
added
lightly
and
turned
away
to
other
things
in
his
way
fred
compels
my
admiration
for
this
is
only
one
instance
of
many
one
thread
in
the
texture
of
our
daily
life
how
i
long
to
read
a
few
pages
of
urn
burial
in
order
to
forget
it
all
it
is
too
soon
to
know
whether
or
not
we
are
a
success
but
we
are
each
of
us
drawing
a
small
salary
and
to
me
that
is
an
immediate
help
what
a
curious
jumble
is
our
life
forces
strange
and
the
very
stars
in
their
courses
seem
to
be
defending
children
lest
i
should
do
them
an
injury
but
in
order
to
keep
them
and
rear
them
i
must
resort
to
a
kind
of
of
backstairs
shifts
and
devices
such
as
i
have
described
that
make
my
cheek
burn
but
i
suppose
it
is
as
dibdin
says
we
are
all
the
ministers
and
retinue
be
it
in
court
dress
or
in
tinsel
and
livery
of
that
exalted
prince
of
the
world
the
child
for
me
however
it
is
still
a
struggle
to
grasp
that
ineluctable
truth
perhaps
as
a
reward
for
this
as
a
sort
of
pourboire
of
fate
i
shall
become
gruesomely
rich
a
kind
of
mæcenas
an
orgulous
figure
among
scholars
and
finance
some
new
tudor
or
early
english
texts
or
collections
of
the
classics
my
pipe
has
gone
out
i
have
taken
to
puffing
a
pipe
in
a
manner
that
would
delight
the
soul
of
dibdin
dibdin
every
day
i
expect
to
hear
from
him
but
still
my
expectation
is
vain
the
children
are
all
abed
and
i
sit
here
filled
with
a
sense
that
i
am
responsible
for
all
of
them
sleeping
and
waking
for
their
nourishment
and
existence
for
all
this
machinery
that
keeps
the
six
of
us
going
and
the
thought
fills
me
with
yet
there
is
a
kind
of
pleasant
sense
of
pride
in
it
too
dibdin
would
say
that
i
reminded
him
of
a
broody
hen
and
dibdin
would
be
right
a
broody
hen
is
a
model
of
responsibility
for
all
mankind
yet
though
i
can
not
look
with
confidence
upon
all
of
this
or
upon
my
enterprise
with
fred
i
can
hardly
resist
a
feeling
that
something
of
the
youth
and
manhood
i
have
spent
as
a
solitary
among
books
something
stirring
and
effervescent
that
i
have
suppressed
is
struggling
for
an
outlet
methods
of
business
though
i
wince
at
some
of
them
fill
me
with
gusts
of
irresistible
laughter
his
constant
horseplay
and
good
humor
are
infectious
he
came
to
me
with
a
grave
countenance
and
informed
me
that
sampson
and
company
a
house
from
which
we
sometimes
buy
a
few
bonds
desired
to
know
whether
we
would
join
them
in
underwriting
the
roumanian
loan
and
what
did
you
say
i
inquired
with
equal
gravity
naturally
i
told
him
i
must
consult
my
partner
what
did
they
say
to
that
sure
he
said
it
a
large
fifteen
millions
all
we
want
you
to
take
is
about
three
i
looked
at
him
quizzically
well
what
say
partner
shall
we
take
it
i
scrutinized
his
baffling
expression
and
roared
with
laughter
he
joined
me
laughing
until
the
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
but
look
here
he
began
the
flamboyancy
of
his
manner
persisting
even
in
private
three
millions
so
the
profit
would
be
large
so
long
as
it
was
horseplay
i
enjoyed
the
joke
but
with
fred
the
barrier
between
jest
and
earnest
is
very
thin
often
indistinguishable
talk
rot
i
told
him
do
you
want
a
short
cut
to
bankruptcy
well
it
would
be
in
a
great
cause
he
grinned
got
to
help
dear
old
roumania
and
humming
a
tune
he
left
me
but
i
am
still
conscious
of
a
dread
lest
fred
in
some
moment
of
irresistible
magnificence
should
commit
poor
little
salmon
and
byrd
to
the
devil
or
the
deep
is
a
day
for
me
the
red
letter
came
from
dibdin
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
brief
scrawl
in
the
peculiar
heavy
unadorned
script
which
i
love
is
written
on
the
minutely
ruled
paper
and
in
the
violet
ink
of
the
hotel
de
france
at
papeete
but
it
was
so
delightfully
cheering
to
see
his
dear
old
fist
like
seeing
the
man
himself
the
sheet
is
dated
more
than
two
months
ago
and
postmarked
san
francisco
six
days
ago
i
wonder
what
brute
intrusted
with
mailing
it
has
carried
it
about
in
his
pocket
without
a
word
of
preamble
it
begins
in
abrupt
manner
got
you
on
my
mind
how
are
the
kids
you
old
bookworm
picked
up
something
for
you
even
out
first
edition
of
somewhat
and
the
worse
for
wear
but
intact
all
the
same
i
intrust
it
to
the
mails
bring
it
to
you
i
am
enclosing
a
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
now
be
an
idiot
however
difficult
that
may
prove
i
know
all
you
can
say
and
believe
me
it
worth
a
damn
use
it
in
some
way
for
the
kids
and
make
me
feel
happy
out
here
among
the
wrecks
and
loafers
of
white
humanity
i
wish
you
could
come
out
here
some
day
and
see
to
what
creatures
that
once
were
white
men
will
stoop
just
to
avoid
a
little
work
however
by
the
way
i
count
on
you
to
do
as
i
ask
or
make
me
sore
the
blessed
old
tub
i
came
out
in
sails
for
suva
in
three
days
and
from
suva
i
go
to
the
marquesas
hear
from
me
again
before
long
if
you
want
to
take
a
chance
and
write
me
the
hotel
de
france
papeete
is
still
the
best
address
i
can
offer
you
yours
dibdin
that
was
months
of
waiting
i
wish
the
old
fellow
enjoyed
writing
letters
a
little
more
than
he
seems
to
nevertheless
i
was
delighted
the
irrepressible
tramp
he
speaks
of
the
marquesas
as
if
they
were
around
the
corner
as
to
his
check
my
first
impulse
was
to
destroy
it
immediately
i
shall
keep
it
however
as
a
memento
of
absurd
generosity
of
spirit
it
would
have
to
be
some
desperate
need
that
would
ever
compel
me
to
use
it
dibdin
little
dreams
of
salmon
and
byrd
i
called
in
the
children
to
show
them
the
letter
and
though
they
were
less
excited
about
it
than
i
was
they
seemed
delighted
at
the
fact
that
after
a
day
in
the
office
i
should
appear
gay
and
cheerful
instead
of
weary
and
careworn
care
is
the
badge
of
incomplete
lives
and
what
i
needed
was
a
letter
from
dibdin
a
breath
of
the
wide
world
has
come
to
me
with
that
pleasant
burly
note
of
of
freedom
of
rovings
and
wanderings
something
of
the
zest
i
used
to
feel
i
used
to
feel
myself
or
so
i
think
strung
like
a
lute
sensitive
to
every
breath
and
sign
of
beauty
to
all
the
subtle
tunes
of
life
my
nerves
are
duller
now
responsive
only
to
the
obvious
in
the
inverted
world
of
business
i
suppose
that
is
progress
letter
has
brought
back
something
of
my
old
self
at
least
a
nostalgia
of
other
days
and
here
my
conscience
smites
me
it
is
long
since
i
have
seen
gertrude
i
must
rectify
that
omission
at
once
after
all
gertrude
has
been
patience
itself
with
my
vagaries
and
the
thought
of
the
old
freedom
is
struck
through
with
the
years
of
her
friendship
gertrude
never
interfered
i
have
seen
gertrude
and
she
was
indulgently
amiable
when
i
read
her
letter
i
believe
ranny
she
was
pleased
to
say
you
are
developing
do
you
know
i
think
business
experience
very
good
for
you
it
was
very
agreeable
to
see
gertrude
curled
up
on
a
sofa
in
a
very
pretty
tea
gown
comfortably
smoking
her
cigarette
i
felt
suddenly
that
the
neglect
of
feminine
society
is
a
mistake
for
any
man
most
of
all
for
myself
glad
my
partner
here
i
told
her
he
might
give
me
away
i
care
she
answered
you
are
a
stronger
man
than
you
were
a
few
months
and
even
a
few
weeks
ago
here
you
are
attracting
money
a
thousand
dollars
is
always
a
thousand
dollars
yes
indeed
let
morgan
look
to
his
laurels
i
relied
his
days
are
numbered
be
absurd
she
laughed
be
rich
before
you
know
it
but
that
the
point
lots
of
other
things
see
in
a
new
way
been
a
sentimentalist
ranny
she
went
on
explaining
business
gives
a
man
judgment
instead
of
sentimentality
come
to
understand
that
my
advice
to
you
in
a
number
of
things
including
the
children
had
more
sense
to
it
then
you
guessed
you
will
recognize
that
even
children
can
be
cared
for
better
by
efficient
people
trained
for
it
than
by
an
inexperienced
bachelor
and
a
little
foundling
girl
worry
about
that
now
she
added
hastily
but
find
out
my
answering
grin
must
have
been
of
a
sickly
pallid
hue
for
i
own
i
felt
myself
chilling
at
her
words
i
thought
i
put
in
that
that
was
all
over
and
settled
between
us
so
it
is
ranny
dear
she
answered
quickly
misunderstand
i
am
not
advising
now
i
am
merely
prophesying
oh
in
that
case
i
endeavored
to
be
conciliatory
it
will
be
a
pleasant
game
to
watch
how
true
your
prophecy
comes
yes
she
spoke
more
eagerly
now
tell
me
about
your
business
it
must
be
horribly
interesting
it
horribly
is
i
agreed
and
fearfully
done
and
i
went
on
to
describe
to
her
amusement
some
of
the
ways
and
means
of
the
ingenious
fred
salmon
how
delightful
was
her
laughing
comment
do
you
know
ranny
when
married
i
mean
to
come
down
to
your
office
quite
often
better
come
now
i
suggested
who
be
an
office
by
then
oh
it
so
long
to
when
you
take
your
holiday
the
sooner
the
better
i
told
her
quite
sincerely
i
see
no
object
in
any
further
whereat
gertrude
seemed
pleased
oh
spring
it
on
you
one
of
these
days
she
smiled
gayly
now
will
you
have
some
tea
or
something
to
drink
a
very
companionable
person
is
gertrude
since
as
a
great
man
has
said
a
grand
passion
is
as
rare
as
a
grand
opera
i
presume
that
notwithstanding
novelists
and
romancers
to
the
contrary
companionship
is
what
virtually
all
successful
marriages
are
based
on
one
thing
my
business
experience
has
taught
me
thus
far
is
a
disgust
with
vague
and
indefinite
conditions
the
sooner
gertrude
and
i
are
married
the
better
i
shall
like
it
barely
had
i
written
down
the
last
words
above
than
something
occurred
to
give
them
the
lie
i
am
still
shaken
with
anger
at
what
i
have
learned
alicia
whom
i
had
thought
to
be
in
bed
rapped
gently
on
my
door
and
came
in
her
sweet
candid
face
so
charged
with
pain
and
alarm
that
i
jumped
from
my
chair
at
sight
of
her
i
have
seemed
scarcely
to
notice
her
these
months
yet
i
realize
she
has
grown
as
dear
to
me
as
any
of
the
other
children
to
see
her
suffering
seemed
poignantly
intolerable
what
on
earth
i
gasped
is
the
matter
alicia
she
could
scarcely
speak
for
the
tears
that
were
choking
her
is
it
any
of
the
children
sir
she
sobbed
right
what
on
earth
can
it
be
then
i
demanded
putting
my
arm
about
this
little
niobe
and
gently
seating
her
in
the
big
chair
come
my
dear
tell
me
about
it
she
made
an
effort
to
control
her
sobs
you
me
away
she
wept
the
same
old
story
that
i
thought
must
be
this
obsession
am
i
i
spoke
as
gently
as
i
knew
how
taking
her
little
cold
hand
in
mine
and
why
am
i
going
to
do
that
i
know
she
sobbed
bitterly
i
suppose
because
i
am
no
use
you
want
me
i
laughed
at
her
boisterously
in
an
endeavor
to
shake
her
out
of
that
notion
and
who
i
asked
has
said
anything
of
the
kind
she
did
not
answer
was
it
griselda
no
sir
she
breathed
was
it
any
of
the
children
oh
no
uncle
mean
byrd
they
like
me
what
was
it
then
i
insisted
gayly
come
out
with
it
i
never
heard
such
bosh
come
tell
me
the
whole
story
alicia
was
in
the
square
this
afternoon
she
began
drying
her
eyes
with
a
very
wet
and
crumpled
little
handkerchief
playing
with
jimmie
while
laura
and
ranny
were
and
she
paused
yes
yes
i
urged
and
then
a
lady
stopped
to
talk
to
was
bayard
miss
bayard
i
repeated
wonderingly
it
was
strange
gertrude
had
not
mentioned
it
she
must
i
thought
have
forgotten
the
incident
and
what
i
prompted
did
miss
bayard
say
she
said
and
lips
quivered
pitifully
you
still
here
child
on
i
could
hardly
trust
myself
to
speak
for
the
premonitory
anger
that
was
rising
within
me
i
told
her
yes
alicia
spoke
somewhat
more
easily
feeling
evidently
that
i
was
not
against
her
and
miss
bayard
said
she
went
on
that
she
thought
i
had
gone
away
weeks
ago
i
understand
what
she
meant
and
i
asked
her
where
she
thought
i
had
gone
anybody
from
the
home
come
to
look
you
up
she
asked
me
and
i
told
her
that
miss
smith
had
come
and
she
asked
me
whether
miss
smith
done
anything
about
me
and
i
told
her
that
miss
smith
she
said
i
could
stay
and
what
did
she
say
to
that
i
gasped
by
this
time
livid
with
anger
she
said
it
was
very
she
did
not
understand
it
she
say
it
to
me
she
seemed
to
be
speaking
to
herself
and
then
she
just
gave
a
little
nod
and
walked
away
just
gave
a
little
nod
and
walked
away
i
repeated
after
her
mechanically
and
because
of
that
you
thought
i
was
planning
to
send
you
away
yes
byrd
she
murmured
with
a
dejection
that
in
the
young
is
so
profoundly
touching
it
makes
heart
ache
well
and
i
hope
my
sickly
laugh
was
as
reassuring
as
it
was
meant
to
be
and
if
i
tell
you
that
i
knew
nothing
at
all
about
that
make
you
feel
better
she
nodded
and
if
i
tell
you
that
so
far
from
planning
to
send
you
away
i
do
without
you
that
you
are
necessary
in
this
house
that
you
are
just
the
same
to
me
as
any
of
the
other
children
that
i
make
no
distinction
between
you
that
in
house
is
your
home
you
grow
up
and
get
long
as
you
want
to
be
and
i
sat
on
the
side
of
the
chair
drew
her
to
me
and
patted
her
as
i
might
have
patted
little
laura
is
that
all
right
yes
ranny
she
whispered
her
head
sinking
toward
me
like
a
and
a
sigh
of
deep
content
escaped
her
i
want
anything
else
in
this
world
how
beautifully
affection
sits
upon
a
child
now
go
to
bed
alicia
i
urged
her
gently
and
bother
your
innocent
little
head
about
anything
of
that
sort
miss
bayard
was
probably
joking
do
that
she
knows
how
badly
it
made
you
feel
she
stirred
as
from
a
trance
and
slowly
rose
how
is
the
school
work
going
i
asked
her
all
right
yes
byrd
she
murmured
except
the
put
in
enough
time
on
it
the
teacher
says
especially
the
latin
composition
ah
have
to
remedy
that
you
must
come
and
let
me
help
you
what
are
you
reading
in
latin
commentaries
she
smiled
shamefacedly
like
a
troubled
child
that
has
been
restored
to
happiness
ah
then
you
get
it
right
for
what
would
happen
alicia
if
you
were
to
face
the
world
ignorant
of
how
cæsar
conquered
the
belgians
and
if
you
should
go
out
into
life
without
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
equipment
of
infantry
of
the
habits
of
the
gauls
and
the
right
use
of
the
catapult
or
the
proper
employment
of
the
chariot
the
consequences
might
be
little
short
of
ignominious
better
come
to
me
and
let
me
set
you
straight
i
know
you
understand
indirect
discourse
from
the
way
you
told
me
your
story
but
the
subjunctive
my
the
subjunctive
must
be
closer
to
you
than
a
brother
and
nearer
than
hands
and
feet
she
laughed
a
merry
delicious
peal
of
laughter
and
when
she
said
good
night
i
put
my
hand
upon
her
soft
silken
hair
and
sent
from
the
room
a
very
radiant
happy
little
girl
but
now
as
my
thought
wanders
back
to
surprising
uncontrollable
indignation
again
possesses
me
to
think
that
it
was
she
who
had
instigated
the
visit
of
that
little
inspectress
miss
smith
weeks
ago
it
is
unbelievable
underhand
methods
in
gertrude
are
new
to
me
i
have
called
up
gertrude
on
the
telephone
and
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
she
insisted
in
a
somewhat
wintry
voice
that
i
had
better
come
up
at
once
and
see
her
as
she
put
it
settle
it
once
for
all
to
settle
it
once
for
all
is
precisely
what
i
desire
my
desire
has
been
stormily
satisfied
though
inwardly
indignant
i
returned
to
gertrude
with
every
intention
of
being
very
bland
and
very
reasonable
hoping
against
hope
to
have
the
unlovely
fact
somehow
cleared
away
but
gertrude
it
seems
had
decided
that
the
indignation
properly
belonged
to
her
hello
ranny
she
greeted
me
easily
in
the
gray
tone
that
precedes
a
tempest
what
do
you
mean
by
speaking
to
me
as
you
did
over
the
telephone
mean
this
i
faltered
but
that
was
the
last
time
i
faltered
in
speaking
to
her
did
you
or
did
you
not
report
the
case
of
alicia
to
the
home
and
send
an
inspectress
to
me
she
watched
me
with
narrowed
eyelids
for
a
moment
and
then
deciding
evidently
that
a
little
truculence
would
reduce
me
to
my
normal
state
of
pulp
she
answered
coolly
and
suppose
i
of
it
i
merely
want
to
know
the
truth
i
answered
her
quietly
enough
lies
are
so
detestable
to
me
she
flinched
perceptibly
but
drew
herself
up
with
hauteur
well
then
i
she
returned
loftily
but
what
if
i
had
somebody
ought
to
have
reported
it
she
ran
on
with
gathering
temper
by
which
she
thought
to
crush
me
i
think
indecent
for
you
to
have
in
the
house
a
girl
of
that
age
no
relation
to
you
the
fact
that
you
are
a
fool
make
it
any
less
indecent
the
only
woman
friend
you
have
and
somebody
has
to
see
you
make
a
worse
idiot
of
yourself
than
nature
made
you
to
start
with
now
do
you
understand
my
excellent
friend
and
having
discharged
this
volley
she
stood
panting
lividly
as
if
viewing
my
ruins
at
the
moment
however
i
could
not
consider
her
i
knew
only
that
flashes
of
red
appeared
before
my
eyes
that
i
spoke
the
literal
truth
when
i
told
her
to
me
such
an
action
and
the
person
guilty
of
it
would
be
equally
contemptible
you
say
that
to
me
she
gasped
taking
a
step
forward
with
a
colorable
imitation
of
incredulity
strange
in
view
of
her
denial
to
i
told
her
quietly
enough
for
now
i
was
more
master
of
myself
and
contemptible
is
only
a
mild
euphemism
for
what
i
should
really
think
she
stared
at
me
speechless
for
a
moment
think
she
uttered
in
mocking
scorn
posed
as
a
sort
of
what
you
are
is
the
tool
take
care
gertrude
i
warned
her
you
might
say
something
that
you
will
regret
even
more
she
waved
me
contemptuously
away
say
this
she
returned
in
level
tones
seating
herself
and
clenching
her
hands
in
an
effort
at
in
reality
she
was
beginning
a
new
offensive
better
go
home
ranny
and
make
up
your
mind
to
send
that
girl
away
all
men
are
rotten
but
because
i
thought
you
were
different
she
did
not
finish
but
added
and
to
have
you
gathering
in
girls
from
the
stop
i
cried
i
hear
another
word
and
turned
away
as
if
to
go
not
trusting
myself
to
say
more
come
back
she
called
jumping
from
the
sofa
come
back
and
listen
either
you
send
that
girl
away
or
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
is
that
understood
i
laughed
at
her
mirthlessly
choose
between
her
and
me
she
uttered
with
the
touch
of
melodrama
that
few
women
seem
to
escape
be
theatrical
i
told
her
now
more
in
control
of
myself
that
girl
makes
it
possible
for
me
to
bring
up
children
she
is
no
more
to
me
than
any
of
the
others
but
however
that
may
be
she
that
please
gertrude
she
stays
then
chosen
she
demanded
in
livid
stupefaction
announced
no
choice
but
the
girl
stays
thank
god
she
lifted
her
hands
upwards
and
i
hope
her
prayer
was
acceptable
i
knew
i
was
tied
to
a
fool
she
added
as
though
i
had
been
holding
her
enchained
but
i
did
not
know
he
was
a
knave
as
well
free
at
last
i
walked
out
without
trusting
myself
to
make
reply
i
sincerely
hope
gertrude
will
enjoy
her
freedom
more
than
she
did
her
bondage
anyway
i
am
glad
she
has
entered
a
denial
as
i
walked
home
under
a
starry
sky
however
i
was
amazed
to
feel
my
anger
cooling
rapidly
the
sense
of
defeat
of
disappointment
with
human
nature
giving
way
to
a
new
feeling
of
freedom
to
an
elation
i
had
not
experienced
in
years
i
definitely
felt
a
leap
of
exhilaration
in
the
wake
of
the
other
mingled
emotions
it
took
me
by
surprise
matrimony
is
obviously
not
for
such
shameful
villains
as
myself
if
gertrude
expects
me
to
return
on
bended
marrow
bones
and
sue
for
forgiveness
i
am
certain
she
is
mistaken
matrimony
is
not
for
me
that
at
least
is
clear
the
dancing
flamboyancy
in
his
veins
has
proved
too
much
for
my
revered
partner
fred
salmon
with
a
glimmer
hall
bravado
half
amusement
in
his
eyes
he
announced
to
me
this
morning
that
he
has
signed
on
for
a
piece
of
the
roumanian
loan
i
was
stupefied
how
much
i
gasped
faintly
watching
him
closely
for
i
could
not
believe
it
only
a
measly
million
he
replied
with
deprecating
cockiness
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
make
them
let
us
come
in
at
all
if
it
for
your
cold
feet
i
would
have
taken
the
three
millions
and
his
chuckle
irritated
me
beyond
words
he
was
in
earnest
he
was
not
joking
and
where
the
devil
i
spluttered
will
you
get
the
money
for
even
the
initial
payment
raise
it
my
boy
raise
it
he
bent
beetling
over
me
if
we
want
to
amount
to
anything
got
to
take
chances
one
syndicate
participation
like
that
and
perhaps
another
with
the
newspaper
publicity
and
made
men
in
the
street
got
to
do
it
want
to
be
a
piker
all
your
life
i
i
stammered
limply
stark
raving
mad
and
how
do
you
propose
to
raise
the
money
by
selling
the
bonds
fellow
he
announced
with
aloof
superiority
have
you
got
the
bonds
no
they
are
not
even
in
this
country
we
give
them
certificates
until
the
bonds
arrive
have
you
got
the
certificates
no
was
the
astounding
reply
sell
first
get
the
money
for
turn
it
over
to
sampson
company
the
syndicate
managers
and
draw
our
certificates
how
it
works
of
course
if
we
were
a
bigger
house
better
known
it
would
be
easier
but
do
you
do
it
you
mean
i
groped
we
have
to
sell
something
we
even
in
hand
and
get
money
for
it
what
it
amounts
to
he
grinned
though
less
jauntily
than
before
i
felt
myself
crumbling
to
dust
sit
there
like
that
he
cried
regarding
me
as
one
looks
down
from
the
side
of
a
great
liner
upon
a
drifting
derelict
get
busy
get
on
the
telephone
and
sell
some
roumanian
bonds
and
he
chuckled
in
his
absurd
triumphant
manner
that
will
one
day
drive
me
to
desperation
begin
with
your
friend
visconti
he
suggested
he
seems
to
have
taken
a
shine
to
you
talk
to
him
in
dago
many
and
many
a
time
had
i
asked
myself
what
i
was
doing
in
that
particular
galley
to
enter
a
new
occupation
without
enthusiasm
for
a
cloistered
monk
like
myself
to
go
out
into
the
market
place
as
a
chafferer
and
a
huckster
among
a
race
i
had
not
even
cared
to
understand
and
to
embrace
their
ideals
and
their
career
concerning
which
i
had
not
even
curiosity
had
been
difficult
enough
with
the
lash
of
my
need
i
had
whipped
myself
like
a
flagellant
to
the
daily
grind
until
custom
had
given
it
the
ungrateful
familiarity
that
the
treadmill
must
have
for
the
mule
but
to
embark
upon
this
murky
enterprise
of
charged
for
me
with
the
dread
of
a
hundred
lurking
pitfalls
into
which
i
should
infallibly
stumble
charged
with
the
fear
of
certain
failure
all
my
instincts
revolted
against
it
nevertheless
like
a
lost
soul
i
suffered
myself
to
be
driven
because
i
must
it
is
to
the
glory
of
human
nature
that
there
is
more
of
the
milk
and
marrow
of
human
kindness
in
it
than
pessimists
give
it
credit
for
the
excellent
visconti
after
listening
to
me
in
silence
while
i
lamely
and
guiltily
explained
my
offer
to
him
courteously
replied
in
italian
if
you
recommend
them
signor
i
will
take
them
i
can
not
take
many
but
i
will
take
five
i
thanked
him
as
best
i
could
but
i
shrank
back
as
under
a
blow
this
man
was
buying
not
roumanian
bonds
so
much
as
my
word
besides
though
the
bonds
were
right
enough
i
had
nothing
to
give
him
and
yet
i
wanted
his
money
i
could
not
face
it
and
so
i
informed
my
egregious
fred
so
said
fred
reflectively
and
for
a
moment
he
was
lost
in
thought
then
as
is
his
wont
he
suddenly
began
to
radiate
the
heat
of
a
new
inspiration
got
it
he
cried
listen
here
only
put
half
your
capital
into
this
business
got
in
the
much
is
it
thousand
in
securities
i
gaped
at
him
in
terror
well
he
ran
on
suppose
you
bring
them
over
deposit
them
with
sampson
and
company
against
that
much
in
else
borrow
money
on
you
see
he
slapped
his
knee
gleefully
then
we
have
those
certificates
on
hand
we
can
pass
right
out
to
fellows
like
visconti
who
come
straight
across
and
so
go
on
with
the
game
when
through
all
done
is
to
lend
thousand
in
securities
given
us
a
big
lift
and
you
put
your
securities
back
in
the
vault
you
see
that
no
that
clear
he
asked
in
an
injured
tone
clear
as
pitch
i
answered
truthfully
never
mind
he
clapped
me
smartly
on
the
shoulder
you
go
bring
your
securities
over
make
it
clear
of
course
draw
interest
on
the
loan
making
the
firm
and
like
the
mule
i
am
i
dully
complied
and
now
we
are
laboring
on
with
the
sale
of
the
million
in
foreign
bonds
to
people
the
majority
of
whom
have
not
a
notion
whether
roumania
is
the
capital
of
rome
or
a
central
american
republic
declares
balzac
accuse
toujours
la
puissance
de
nos
but
as
i
had
no
pretensions
in
this
business
loss
and
failure
would
be
doubly
humiliating
what
then
i
ask
myself
again
am
i
doing
in
that
galley
meantime
what
remains
of
my
slender
possessions
is
hypothecated
to
the
pretensions
i
had
never
entertained
i
have
been
in
the
suburbs
it
is
idle
for
me
to
try
to
find
either
a
house
or
an
apartment
in
any
region
that
would
be
suitable
for
both
my
means
and
the
children
in
new
york
so
for
two
saturdays
and
two
sundays
i
have
been
trudging
the
dreariness
of
the
less
expensive
suburbs
in
quest
of
a
house
what
exclaimed
fred
when
he
heard
of
it
not
going
to
leave
the
shoe
yes
i
told
him
the
shoe
pinches
i
must
find
another
well
a
funny
old
geezer
was
his
laughing
comment
i
could
do
better
than
that
in
describing
him
when
i
come
home
depressed
and
weary
i
find
a
shower
of
little
attentions
awaiting
me
very
winning
and
touchingly
agreeable
little
jimmie
with
great
serious
eyes
ostentatiously
brings
me
my
slippers
and
dressing
gown
and
watches
my
face
intently
for
the
reward
of
commendation
when
i
murmur
thanks
old
man
very
good
of
you
i
can
virtually
see
his
little
pulses
pounding
with
exultation
in
his
veins
are
you
vewy
tired
uncle
ranny
he
inquires
keeping
up
the
high
drama
of
profound
concern
so
so
old
chap
i
tell
him
kissing
his
serious
little
face
nothing
to
worry
about
a
moment
later
i
hear
him
dashing
about
the
dining
room
very
properly
and
completely
oblivious
of
my
fatigue
laura
in
the
rôle
of
hebe
gravely
brings
me
tea
on
a
small
tray
and
asks
whether
there
is
any
book
i
desire
or
anything
else
that
she
might
bring
me
but
behind
all
these
attentions
i
discern
the
directing
hand
of
alicia
can
it
be
that
the
child
has
instinctively
divined
that
i
have
actually
broken
with
gertrude
on
her
account
that
the
little
soul
in
her
secretly
exults
in
a
feeling
of
victory
since
she
can
not
know
all
the
conditions
she
can
feel
at
most
i
suppose
only
a
vague
primitive
sense
of
triumph
in
defeating
the
will
of
another
woman
perhaps
i
am
attributing
too
much
to
her
young
intelligence
but
at
times
i
seem
to
perceive
in
her
eyes
in
her
bearing
a
touch
of
the
protective
instinct
of
almost
the
maternal
toward
me
that
i
had
never
observed
in
her
before
possibly
it
is
merely
a
sense
of
gratitude
at
all
events
those
attentions
of
the
little
people
are
very
soothing
and
grateful
notably
now
since
have
declined
perforce
in
view
of
her
greatly
increased
work
in
the
kitchen
yet
it
staggers
me
at
times
when
i
realize
the
number
of
souls
for
whose
shelter
and
livelihood
i
am
responsible
for
the
complex
machinery
that
i
must
keep
revolving
experience
like
that
should
be
acquired
young
like
roosevelt
i
would
advocate
early
marriages
i
have
found
a
house
in
crestlands
thrilling
are
the
names
of
suburbs
minutes
from
grand
central
station
in
westchester
county
i
came
upon
a
cottage
built
largely
upon
a
rock
that
i
believe
will
answer
our
purpose
the
rent
is
moderate
and
there
is
said
to
be
an
asparagus
bed
somewhere
in
the
grounds
i
know
there
are
two
trees
with
gnarled
roots
grasping
their
way
downward
among
the
stones
in
a
struggle
for
existence
and
there
are
a
few
inches
of
lawn
for
the
children
with
a
veritable
terrain
like
that
as
dower
it
will
surprise
no
one
that
i
took
the
cottage
the
rather
uncertain
and
the
longitude
also
is
vague
as
vague
almost
as
that
of
roumania
nevertheless
i
shall
be
henceforth
a
dweller
of
suburbia
this
being
sunday
i
took
the
children
out
there
in
the
afternoon
to
examine
their
new
demesne
with
the
air
of
a
castellan
exhibiting
an
old
castle
i
showed
them
through
the
rooms
and
in
the
phrases
of
the
dealer
i
enumerated
their
a
heavy
heart
but
the
children
cared
nothing
about
that
randolph
saw
visions
of
a
tent
or
an
indian
tepee
under
one
of
the
gnarled
old
trees
and
jimmie
illustrated
how
he
would
woll
down
the
slope
all
our
grounds
are
slope
praeterea
but
laura
detecting
a
neglected
rose
bush
near
one
of
the
windows
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
this
is
like
the
house
in
uncle
ranny
she
cried
delightedly
there
will
be
roses
peeping
in
and
babies
peeping
out
i
looked
at
her
in
poignant
surprise
it
was
so
absolutely
the
voice
of
her
mother
when
she
was
a
girl
the
spirit
and
the
expression
it
is
exactly
that
feature
that
my
poor
sister
would
have
first
taken
into
account
it
might
have
been
laura
herself
i
turned
away
in
order
not
to
cloud
their
delight
the
poetry
of
life
is
the
only
thing
worth
living
for
yet
what
a
toll
the
world
exacts
on
that
commodity
griselda
in
spite
of
all
temptation
had
declined
to
come
is
there
a
good
kitchen
she
demanded
i
told
her
i
thought
there
was
then
i
will
not
waste
my
time
looking
for
the
birdies
in
the
trees
or
the
paint
on
the
roof
she
retorted
stoutly
she
even
demurred
at
coming
over
much
to
do
she
protested
darkly
of
discomfort
and
wretchedness
let
none
speak
i
have
sounded
both
and
so
much
else
that
is
unpleasant
to
the
abysmal
depths
that
i
shall
never
again
look
with
the
same
eyes
upon
the
impassive
faces
of
the
men
in
the
moving
express
train
they
have
all
no
doubt
lived
and
suffered
even
as
i
these
my
brothers
i
have
moved
the
household
to
my
suburb
and
this
is
a
lament
the
legendary
mandrake
is
a
gurgling
infant
to
the
way
my
books
cried
upon
removing
they
not
only
screamed
they
sobbed
and
quivered
like
broken
souls
to
be
dislodged
from
their
place
that
has
known
and
loved
them
so
well
and
so
long
every
object
in
the
flat
was
a
whole
plantation
of
mandrakes
their
wailing
and
ululation
resounds
yet
in
their
new
and
changed
surroundings
roses
peeping
in
indeed
to
my
books
this
is
a
house
of
sorrow
forlorn
and
jumbled
and
still
unsorted
they
stand
and
lie
in
heaps
so
that
their
fallen
state
wrings
my
lacerated
heart
alicia
to
whom
i
sadly
complained
of
this
condition
consolingly
answered
but
my
english
teacher
in
school
would
say
that
that
was
a
ranny
books
and
things
really
feel
do
they
they
i
bitterly
exclaimed
let
unemotional
pedants
speak
as
they
stupidly
will
alicia
nothing
can
be
more
poignantly
pathetic
than
a
fallacy
yes
sir
murmured
alicia
and
with
reverent
fingers
she
silently
helped
me
to
place
some
of
those
books
she
has
a
tender
touch
for
the
objects
of
other
love
a
charming
attribute
in
a
woman
and
from
the
physical
chaos
in
the
châlet
at
crestlands
i
am
whirled
madly
every
morning
in
a
crowded
express
train
then
in
a
convulsively
serried
subway
car
to
the
more
subtle
chaos
in
the
office
of
salmon
and
sell
roumanian
bonds
roumanian
bonds
are
overrunning
those
offices
like
the
rats
in
the
town
of
hamelin
ah
will
not
some
piper
pied
or
otherwise
come
and
pipe
them
all
into
the
sea
the
answer
i
grieve
to
say
is
no
the
impossibility
of
shifting
burdens
is
the
fundamental
mistake
of
creation
nothing
irritates
me
more
after
a
fruitless
telephoning
or
ineffectual
running
about
than
to
have
fred
salmon
smile
sleekly
clap
me
on
the
back
and
mumble
mechanically
great
work
old
boy
doing
fine
what
is
the
use
of
these
false
inanities
on
saturday
he
came
to
me
with
the
gratifying
intelligence
that
imber
and
smith
who
took
two
millions
of
the
bonds
have
already
sold
out
their
allotment
damn
them
was
the
only
answer
i
could
find
what
i
say
he
answered
in
his
perfect
rôle
of
being
all
things
to
all
men
then
reflectively
i
think
a
liar
though
wager
nevertheless
that
he
congratulated
smith
as
heartily
as
he
bruises
my
back
to
be
all
things
to
all
men
is
surely
one
of
the
most
disgusting
traits
in
a
human
biped
fitfully
ever
and
again
i
wish
myself
out
of
the
ruck
and
rabble
of
all
that
but
sadly
and
heavily
it
comes
to
me
that
it
is
better
perhaps
to
bear
the
ills
one
has
than
to
fly
to
others
that
are
a
mere
sinister
blank
i
seem
like
a
man
on
a
raft
with
the
waves
washing
over
me
the
while
i
gasp
for
breath
and
hope
for
rescue
i
wonder
what
this
life
would
be
like
if
upon
coming
home
to
crestlands
there
were
not
those
eager
little
retrievers
to
fetch
and
to
carry
and
to
wait
upon
me
to
surround
me
with
their
glad
young
freshness
but
in
candor
i
must
admit
that
but
for
them
i
should
be
leading
my
old
secluded
life
undisturbed
among
books
that
now
seems
remote
as
a
past
incarnation
the
weeks
go
by
and
toiling
under
our
burden
we
are
desperately
trying
to
stem
the
rush
of
time
in
certain
moments
i
have
a
sickly
feeling
that
time
will
crush
us
a
revoltingly
new
discovery
i
made
yesterday
that
fred
has
taken
to
drinking
during
business
hours
suddenly
drew
the
life
out
of
me
like
a
suction
pump
then
realizing
the
meaning
and
the
enormity
of
the
fact
i
was
frightened
out
of
fear
and
talked
to
him
in
as
friendly
and
kindly
a
vein
as
the
circumstances
would
permit
in
an
effort
to
show
him
our
position
and
where
it
might
lead
us
his
first
snarl
of
defiance
gave
way
to
contrition
he
wept
maudlin
tears
and
made
promises
so
robust
that
they
ought
to
outlive
him
feel
shaken
as
never
before
meanwhile
sampson
and
company
are
calling
for
the
payments
due
on
our
allotment
of
bonds
and
fred
the
smiler
and
the
diplomat
is
shirking
interviews
with
them
what
we
need
ranny
he
said
to
me
in
chastened
mood
is
capital
more
capital
we
went
into
this
business
on
a
shoe
it
will
hold
till
you
can
get
a
rope
and
even
a
life
line
is
too
late
i
supplied
he
did
not
answer
but
after
a
pause
he
began
afresh
you
get
round
and
see
some
of
your
rich
whether
they
could
tide
us
over
for
a
spell
rich
friends
i
writhed
as
one
in
torment
who
are
my
rich
friends
i
have
none
as
you
ought
to
know
i
have
now
put
in
every
cent
of
capital
that
i
your
business
experience
fred
and
this
is
where
arrived
if
my
children
dependent
upon
then
i
ended
bitterly
i
be
here
as
i
think
you
know
he
bowed
his
head
your
there
but
to
his
credit
he
did
not
finish
if
as
i
suppose
he
meant
to
ask
whether
laura
left
any
money
that
i
could
use
he
evidently
thought
better
of
it
and
walked
away
in
a
somber
silence
and
that
is
where
we
stand
that
is
where
we
stand
in
our
business
and
the
needs
of
my
household
are
expanding
griselda
knows
nothing
of
my
affairs
and
yet
i
surprise
her
dark
eyes
singularly
lustrous
for
one
of
her
years
watching
me
at
times
out
of
her
swarthy
wrinkled
face
as
if
divining
the
jehannum
i
am
experiencing
more
than
ever
she
lays
herself
out
to
perform
incredible
feats
of
economy
whilst
i
hypocritically
pretend
to
be
unaware
of
it
the
children
having
prospered
and
grown
during
the
winter
are
in
need
of
new
summer
wardrobes
which
i
have
ordered
bought
if
it
is
to
be
disaster
then
shabbiness
shall
not
betray
us
like
the
man
who
donned
evening
clothes
in
which
to
sink
with
the
i
have
always
entertained
a
stubborn
faith
in
the
policy
of
good
clothes
policy
trail
of
policy
is
over
me
like
a
fetid
how
clean
and
unsmirched
i
have
always
felt
in
my
stupid
transparency
gertrude
if
she
knew
it
would
now
rejoice
that
she
had
thrown
me
over
i
envy
our
clerks
and
typists
who
banish
all
cares
at
five
in
the
afternoon
and
do
not
resume
them
until
the
following
morning
what
a
gay
life
is
they
but
knew
it
they
jest
and
fool
and
hurl
picturesque
slang
at
one
another
and
draw
their
pay
on
saturdays
unconscious
of
how
near
to
perdition
we
totter
if
we
go
to
the
wall
they
will
soon
find
other
places
but
find
the
wall
i
wish
i
knew
what
the
emotions
of
fred
are
as
rucking
his
forehead
heavily
he
strides
about
our
rugs
i
only
know
however
that
mine
are
emotions
of
doom
the
black
doom
is
upon
us
after
days
of
haggling
and
lying
and
shuffling
and
paltering
we
have
as
a
firm
expired
our
vain
and
concentrated
efforts
to
sell
something
that
we
had
not
the
necessary
means
and
connections
to
sell
led
us
to
neglect
the
things
we
could
have
done
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
vile
outburst
of
the
sampson
when
as
by
a
firman
he
imperiously
summoned
us
to
his
office
and
told
us
in
his
language
what
he
thought
of
us
people
like
you
belong
in
the
belong
in
jail
assign
he
snarled
better
assign
at
once
and
clear
out
and
not
the
least
of
the
bitterness
of
that
moment
was
the
acrid
realization
that
i
could
not
charge
him
with
having
flattered
and
hounded
fred
into
the
vanity
of
the
enterprise
because
at
that
moment
fred
and
i
were
this
distinction
what
fred
was
suffering
would
roll
from
his
back
like
water
from
a
rhinoceros
whereas
i
would
remain
obscenely
branded
by
his
words
forevermore
it
was
useless
to
argue
futile
to
protest
there
was
no
time
or
place
for
extenuating
circumstances
i
was
too
full
of
shame
and
humiliation
to
offer
any
conciliatory
suggestions
and
i
still
had
enough
of
mulish
pride
not
to
truckle
to
that
bully
we
walked
out
of
that
office
bankrupts
i
still
marvel
how
i
found
my
way
back
to
our
own
office
through
the
lurid
darkness
that
encompassed
me
the
world
about
palpitating
pressing
eager
world
of
which
in
a
measure
i
had
been
a
suddenly
strange
and
phantasmal
and
alien
the
ghostly
city
of
a
dream
the
people
were
shadows
and
their
hurrying
steps
and
errands
as
mysterious
and
as
unrelated
to
my
life
as
those
of
a
colony
of
ants
the
only
actuality
i
did
not
envisage
in
that
dark
moment
which
was
coextensive
with
eternity
was
that
was
the
anemic
ghost
stalking
at
noonday
and
the
others
were
the
reality
if
only
you
had
not
taken
the
balance
of
my
was
the
thought
throbbing
under
my
overwhelming
if
only
you
had
left
me
that
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
whine
to
fred
i
kept
stonily
silent
a
burning
resentment
swelled
my
heart
so
that
i
could
not
speak
the
newspaper
publicity
fred
had
craved
would
come
to
him
now
with
a
vengeance
now
they
are
busy
dismembering
the
corpse
and
colporting
the
remains
whilst
i
sit
darkly
at
home
in
crestlands
like
one
disembodied
dead
i
have
had
time
to
grow
dulled
to
the
shabby
peripety
of
my
career
as
a
business
man
the
sickening
details
and
legal
forms
of
our
failure
are
over
and
i
am
wretchedly
surviving
on
the
loan
made
upon
an
insurance
policy
but
still
i
have
evolved
no
plans
for
the
future
i
sit
in
the
shadow
of
the
châlet
watching
jimmie
rolling
down
the
slope
and
endeavoring
to
roll
up
again
the
early
august
sun
is
hot
in
the
heavens
and
the
air
even
of
crestlands
is
muggy
and
my
pulses
keep
insistently
repeating
repeating
what
is
to
become
of
us
my
not
my
mind
that
useless
functionary
has
quite
simply
suspended
operations
i
used
to
feel
wise
in
reading
montaigne
and
buckle
humorous
with
rabelais
and
cervantes
acute
and
a
man
of
the
world
with
balzac
or
but
none
of
these
erstwhile
comforters
it
appears
seems
able
to
lift
up
my
spirit
modern
young
critics
talk
of
escape
in
literature
but
it
seems
one
can
only
escape
when
there
is
nothing
very
serious
to
escape
from
like
a
debauchee
who
had
killed
his
palate
or
one
who
has
swallowed
an
unwholesome
dish
overnight
the
zestful
taste
for
an
essay
of
elia
the
gustatory
rolling
under
the
tongue
of
sentences
in
religio
medici
the
keen
pleasure
in
a
dryden
preface
all
these
are
now
impossible
the
savor
of
them
has
died
for
me
my
dreams
of
mæcenasship
for
tudor
texts
have
gone
for
joy
in
books
the
tranquil
heart
is
needed
the
world
has
been
too
much
with
me
and
neither
poppy
nor
mandragora
can
banish
the
effects
of
it
there
is
no
balm
to
sane
me
there
was
escape
after
all
not
in
reading
then
in
writing
i
can
quite
understand
now
the
persistence
of
diarists
in
the
world
i
had
no
sooner
written
down
the
words
above
than
a
tremor
of
resolution
shook
me
and
i
went
into
the
baking
city
in
quest
of
livelihood
i
found
nothing
save
exhaustion
but
it
is
certain
that
in
crestlands
i
shall
find
even
less
i
looked
upon
the
teeming
streets
like
a
gawk
surprised
anew
that
so
many
should
find
a
foothold
and
sustenance
where
i
had
failed
the
mystery
of
that
will
always
baffle
me
the
deepening
gloom
gave
way
however
when
i
entered
bookshop
his
welcome
was
warm
stranger
he
greeted
me
cordially
come
into
your
own
i
deny
i
have
felt
it
calling
i
admitted
you
is
nothing
else
in
the
world
ah
how
much
else
andrews
i
told
him
sadly
whether
he
has
heard
of
my
failure
or
not
i
can
not
tell
if
he
has
he
was
tact
itself
here
are
some
beautiful
things
for
you
to
see
he
announced
bustling
as
he
led
me
to
a
table
in
the
rear
of
the
shop
i
looked
at
his
beautiful
things
and
was
able
to
give
him
some
useful
points
about
one
or
two
of
them
he
has
actually
come
upon
a
caxton
the
lucky
devil
this
was
indeed
my
own
as
andrews
was
shrewd
enough
to
divine
me
and
his
courtesy
and
his
deference
were
strangely
consoling
in
the
light
of
my
recent
experiences
courtesy
and
deference
cost
others
so
little
but
what
refreshing
manna
they
are
to
i
go
on
tramping
the
pavements
of
new
york
and
i
wish
there
were
more
point
in
my
trampings
every
morning
i
go
forth
with
a
faint
glow
of
hope
and
the
dim
basis
of
my
hope
when
i
come
to
think
it
out
is
something
like
this
in
the
haunts
of
men
i
may
meet
somebody
an
old
acquaintance
who
may
know
or
hear
of
something
whereby
a
broken
reed
like
myself
a
pronounced
failure
may
get
the
chance
of
earning
a
livelihood
a
desperate
enough
situation
when
reduced
to
the
glaring
light
of
plain
that
is
the
best
that
i
am
able
to
do
if
only
dibdin
were
here
despairingly
i
am
in
need
of
a
friend
but
my
past
life
has
separated
and
insulated
me
so
that
when
i
think
of
friends
and
my
thought
convulsively
darts
out
this
way
and
that
it
encounters
nothing
but
vacancy
empty
air
fred
salmon
is
avoiding
the
club
he
is
the
only
one
who
had
reached
to
me
from
the
past
and
the
result
i
have
already
recorded
i
am
not
eager
to
meet
him
though
i
have
worn
out
any
hostility
i
may
have
felt
toward
him
un
mauvais
metier
que
celui
de
i
find
my
inward
man
the
better
for
thinking
of
fred
neutrally
when
i
think
of
him
at
all
illness
was
the
one
thing
lacking
to
my
ineffable
progress
so
infallibly
illness
has
appeared
jimmie
came
down
with
measles
on
saturday
and
yesterday
alicia
followed
his
example
the
crumpling
of
alicia
under
illness
has
proved
like
the
shattering
of
a
column
in
the
edifice
of
my
household
the
whole
insecure
structure
is
tottering
and
though
she
is
burning
with
fever
the
unhappy
girl
is
murmuring
with
anxiety
that
stockings
go
unmended
and
buttons
unsewn
you
worry
about
that
little
girl
i
keep
telling
her
griselda
will
do
those
things
griselda
has
too
much
to
do
as
it
is
she
gulps
and
the
tears
start
to
her
hot
eyes
i
have
isolated
her
and
jimmie
in
my
room
and
randolph
and
laura
are
cautioned
to
keep
as
far
as
possible
away
from
them
i
remember
the
time
when
i
would
have
flown
from
the
fear
of
infection
as
from
the
plague
but
now
my
anxieties
are
of
a
wholly
different
nature
jimmie
is
mending
now
but
alicia
is
far
more
ill
than
she
knows
griselda
has
undertaken
the
stockings
and
at
night
when
i
sit
watching
and
waiting
for
sounds
from
either
of
my
invalids
i
operate
upon
the
buttons
it
is
curious
how
much
art
enters
into
the
sewing
of
a
button
a
dog
of
a
bachelor
though
i
have
ever
been
i
have
never
been
compelled
to
learn
that
handicraft
before
but
i
have
learned
from
griselda
who
smiled
crookedly
when
she
imparted
the
law
that
if
you
twist
the
thread
around
several
times
after
you
have
sewn
it
the
whole
thing
acquires
relatively
the
strength
of
a
cable
to
your
punctured
fingers
you
attend
afterwards
alicia
awakening
at
midnight
sat
up
in
bed
and
caught
me
at
my
task
she
moaned
most
dolefully
i
hastily
put
little
undies
behind
me
but
too
late
never
want
need
me
the
use
of
getting
well
she
wailed
weakly
oh
yes
i
shall
than
ever
i
hastened
to
assure
her
you
do
everything
now
that
i
ought
to
do
she
pressed
with
febrile
insistence
i
shall
be
no
use
any
more
but
you
see
alicia
i
argued
touching
her
hot
forehead
that
i
shall
have
to
be
earning
money
while
you
are
doing
the
buttons
i
ought
to
be
earning
it
now
so
get
well
as
quickly
as
you
can
jimmie
sees
it
much
better
already
that
logic
seemed
to
soothe
her
more
than
i
had
expected
she
caught
my
hand
impulsively
and
pressed
it
to
her
cheek
the
tremendous
part
played
by
affection
in
the
lives
of
children
is
a
wonder
to
me
alicia
is
convalescent
again
and
jimmie
is
now
running
about
the
little
house
filling
it
with
is
music
to
my
ears
laura
and
randolph
have
fortunately
thus
far
escaped
infection
jimmie
is
wanting
to
resume
wolling
up
and
down
the
slope
again
but
this
is
still
i
can
now
take
up
my
journeys
into
town
again
and
i
note
with
a
pang
that
i
am
growing
shabby
the
yearly
purchases
of
clothes
had
been
as
regular
with
me
as
my
meals
but
i
have
ordered
no
clothes
for
the
spring
or
summer
odd
what
a
deleterious
effect
the
shabbiness
of
clothes
has
upon
consciousness
the
tinge
of
inferiority
it
brings
touches
some
very
tender
places
in
spirit
almost
like
a
shabby
conscience
but
the
doctor
of
the
neighborhood
a
contemplative
fellow
who
obviously
knows
his
business
though
he
talks
of
his
laboratory
and
his
experiments
like
an
alchemist
has
earned
the
clothes
that
i
must
do
without
and
of
the
two
i
needed
them
more
my
search
is
ended
there
is
jubilation
in
my
heart
again
i
have
fallen
into
a
livelihood
like
the
bricklayer
who
used
to
fare
forth
dinner
pail
in
hand
i
have
found
work
and
the
way
of
it
was
an
odd
little
stroke
of
fate
a
whimsicality
that
would
have
pleased
the
ironic
soul
of
thomas
hardy
an
old
college
friend
of
mine
minot
blackden
whom
i
used
to
call
leonardo
da
vinci
because
he
was
so
full
of
ideas
and
inventions
had
rediscovered
he
said
the
art
of
after
a
five
residence
in
italy
on
a
modest
patrimony
most
of
which
had
gone
into
glass
or
into
stain
he
had
returned
to
his
native
land
and
set
up
a
shop
william
morris
somewhere
in
the
region
of
bleecker
street
and
proceeded
to
stain
glass
he
had
had
some
newspaper
publicity
recently
and
there
were
cuts
of
his
work
while
passing
a
church
in
my
hot
and
dusty
peregrinations
it
occurred
to
me
that
here
might
be
a
chance
of
serving
him
and
also
myself
by
writing
an
interesting
booklet
about
his
craft
illustrating
it
profusely
and
sending
it
with
personal
letters
to
all
the
vestries
in
the
country
i
might
bring
a
flood
of
custom
to
his
shop
it
is
with
this
forlorn
proposal
that
i
was
blundering
about
to
discover
minot
blackden
i
failed
to
find
his
shop
but
i
came
face
to
face
with
my
old
salmon
and
byrd
acquaintance
signor
visconti
in
his
palm
beach
suit
and
panama
hat
visconti
made
a
splendent
and
impressive
figure
in
the
purlieus
of
bleecker
street
signor
byrd
he
cried
with
latin
cordiality
seizing
my
hand
in
both
his
own
you
are
what
you
call
a
sight
for
sick
eyes
i
have
often
wonder
about
must
come
into
my
must
have
leetla
refreshment
refreshment
appealed
to
me
at
the
moment
and
gladly
i
accompanied
him
to
his
private
office
in
the
bank
that
stands
between
a
junk
warehouse
and
a
delicatessen
emporium
with
a
charming
tact
he
touched
upon
the
hard
luck
of
salmon
and
byrd
and
dismissed
the
subject
for
good
is
with
a
wealth
of
gesture
and
illustration
he
informed
me
that
he
was
looking
for
a
man
for
his
enlarging
bank
and
asked
me
to
recommend
one
i
want
a
fina
he
explained
american
speeks
a
leetla
da
put
up
what
you
call
a
fina
me
a
fine
front
i
mused
aloud
and
speaks
signor
visconti
we
had
no
such
young
man
in
our
office
i
can
think
of
no
one
i
could
recommend
he
was
obviously
nonplused
i
thinka
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
final
resolution
if
i
could
finda
some
gentleman
lika
you
byrd
he
would
be
what
i
look
for
i
know
he
added
hastily
with
an
apologetic
laugh
man
lika
you
signor
be
hard
to
find
and
again
he
laughed
heartily
though
watching
me
between
narrowed
eyelids
his
drift
was
now
obvious
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
well
if
it
comes
to
that
signor
visconti
i
answered
slowly
i
am
doing
nothing
in
particular
just
now
i
may
be
utterly
no
good
for
you
ah
you
would
try
old
visconti
signor
and
up
flew
his
arms
like
windmills
you
no
ashamed
to
work
in
vot
you
americans
call
da
guinea
colony
no
he
noted
the
deprecating
shadow
on
my
face
ah
you
know
the
granda
history
of
the
italiana
people
and
with
an
admirable
histrionic
transition
he
suddenly
turned
grave
and
byrd
you
are
the
very
man
i
looka
for
and
he
gripped
both
my
hands
but
meester
fear
i
can
not
afford
to
pay
what
you
would
expect
ah
i
could
you
the
very
and
he
clapped
a
hand
dramatically
to
his
the
very
man
but
and
his
full
smile
of
sad
and
wistful
regret
seemed
genuine
for
all
its
histrionic
value
what
do
you
propose
to
pay
signor
visconti
i
inquired
i
can
only
pay
to
start
he
whispered
hoarsely
with
the
round
eyes
of
a
man
facing
the
inevitable
maybe
forty
dollars
week
too
leetla
i
know
he
added
slowly
letting
his
hands
fall
on
his
knees
with
resignation
very
well
signor
visconti
i
said
if
you
will
try
me
i
shall
be
glad
to
come
at
forty
dollars
visconti
fairly
leaped
at
my
hand
and
the
bargain
was
struck
i
am
to
begin
earning
a
livelihood
on
monday
who
said
that
adversity
is
the
best
teacher
possibly
it
is
but
gladness
is
the
ablest
cocktail
there
is
no
stimulant
like
a
little
success
i
am
an
august
personage
i
shall
choke
with
pride
so
august
am
i
become
in
the
banca
e
casa
commerciale
visconti
i
call
up
the
national
city
bank
concerning
the
price
of
bonds
or
the
rate
of
exchange
in
english
so
presumably
impeccable
that
signor
visconti
visibly
puffs
out
his
magnificent
chest
as
he
listens
there
is
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
frontas
them
how
we
will
speaking
i
say
with
firmness
and
the
head
of
curls
his
fine
dyed
mustache
and
turns
away
glowing
with
pleasure
this
is
seemingly
what
the
head
of
has
been
waiting
for
mentally
i
offer
a
fervent
prayer
that
he
may
never
be
disillusioned
as
to
my
capacity
i
toil
as
i
have
never
toiled
before
i
come
early
and
go
late
and
frequently
have
my
lunch
sent
in
from
the
adjoining
delicatessen
powdered
no
doubt
by
the
contiguous
junk
house
and
the
boss
as
the
others
call
him
smiles
with
a
rare
unction
that
spells
approval
with
difficulty
we
are
actually
living
on
my
income
if
i
had
the
half
of
my
capital
back
that
i
had
no
business
to
put
into
salmon
and
ifs
inaugurate
depressing
trains
of
thoughts
my
library
alone
stands
between
me
and
disaster
so
like
a
prudent
man
of
business
i
have
begun
a
catalogue
of
it
and
i
am
training
alicia
to
help
me
i
must
not
again
be
caught
by
so
desperate
a
prospect
as
recently
faced
me
how
my
little
household
had
been
affected
by
my
late
slough
of
despond
i
realize
only
now
that
i
have
passed
it
laughter
and
high
spirits
seem
to
have
been
uncorked
again
we
play
and
we
rollic
and
chatter
more
than
in
the
early
days
of
our
de
long
ago
is
it
less
than
a
year
no
longer
it
is
now
the
end
of
september
and
the
schools
have
reopened
we
are
all
sanely
and
industriously
busy
like
a
normal
american
family
and
as
though
its
head
were
an
adequately
competent
being
and
not
the
bungling
masquerading
amateur
that
he
is
who
never
ate
in
tears
his
bread
we
have
made
intimate
acquaintance
of
poverty
and
we
fear
it
less
than
of
we
hate
it
more
it
may
be
an
impostor
but
who
maintains
that
all
impostors
are
harmless
i
certainly
would
deny
that
premise
are
cataloguing
the
library
here
is
anatomy
of
by
burton
announces
alicia
taking
down
a
volume
small
quarto
printed
at
oxford
i
finish
for
her
yes
she
breathes
marveling
how
can
you
remember
such
things
uncle
ranny
for
so
i
have
asked
her
to
call
me
how
can
i
remember
i
ask
in
surprise
how
can
i
remember
that
you
are
alicia
palmer
close
to
the
towering
age
of
fifteen
or
that
jimmie
pendleton
is
five
but
people
avers
alicia
and
we
i
own
to
a
slight
thrill
at
this
sweet
investiture
implicit
in
her
words
but
i
seem
obtuse
to
it
but
so
is
a
great
book
a
person
i
sententiously
inform
her
and
means
a
first
edition
merely
a
person
but
a
personage
that
book
is
as
proud
an
aristocrat
as
though
it
were
plastered
with
coronets
and
simply
throbbing
with
norman
blood
there
is
a
whole
heraldry
about
is
a
prince
among
books
and
all
alicia
because
it
aroused
interest
and
has
given
them
delight
from
about
the
time
the
pilgrims
first
landed
at
plymouth
a
book
that
could
take
doctor
johnson
out
of
bed
two
hours
sooner
than
he
wished
to
rise
also
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
it
could
feed
us
for
a
time
and
that
is
very
important
it
alicia
yes
she
breathes
in
awe
which
for
some
reason
delights
me
what
a
wonderful
thing
it
must
be
to
write
a
great
book
and
she
fingers
the
next
volume
with
even
greater
reverence
the
of
edward
by
sir
james
prior
reads
alicia
is
that
a
prince
among
books
too
no
i
answer
that
is
just
a
friend
malone
you
see
was
crossed
in
love
in
the
days
of
doctor
johnson
and
by
way
of
consolation
became
a
and
a
shakesperian
commentator
they
say
the
irish
are
fickle
but
here
is
one
who
could
never
love
again
so
whenever
i
read
his
life
i
think
i
see
through
a
sort
of
mist
the
lovely
lady
whom
he
lost
and
all
about
him
is
curiously
dear
to
me
he
feed
us
for
very
long
alicia
but
he
has
given
me
many
hours
of
pleasure
are
in
love
she
inquires
with
gentle
subtlety
and
i
am
surprised
that
one
of
her
youthfulness
should
be
arrested
by
that
particular
point
if
you
mean
me
i
answer
quietly
then
i
can
tell
you
that
i
no
one
ever
loved
me
enough
to
cross
me
i
am
a
collector
by
a
sort
degeneration
alicia
throws
her
fine
young
head
back
and
peals
with
delicious
laughter
afterwards
i
catch
her
smiling
to
herself
as
she
copies
down
the
titles
i
am
amazed
to
note
how
lovely
that
child
has
become
since
she
has
been
here
her
thin
frightened
expression
has
given
way
to
one
of
happy
confidence
all
too
soon
she
will
be
enriching
some
young
life
with
happiness
her
interest
in
my
musty
old
books
has
given
her
a
value
of
companionship
in
my
eyes
that
i
trust
i
shall
not
exaggerate
at
the
expense
of
my
niece
and
alicia
is
hardly
one
to
take
advantage
of
such
a
situation
nevertheless
i
must
be
on
my
guard
after
all
though
she
is
the
chartered
custodian
of
the
others
and
custodiet
shall
watch
over
alicia
obviously
it
is
my
task
to
improve
her
mind
in
order
to
make
her
the
better
guardian
for
them
and
mind
is
improving
apace
uncle
ranny
she
inquired
the
other
day
may
i
ask
what
that
first
edition
of
cost
you
it
costs
me
nothing
but
a
sleepless
hour
now
and
then
i
told
her
it
is
not
paid
for
but
i
owe
andrews
four
hundred
dollars
for
it
god
knows
when
i
shall
pay
it
but
why
do
you
ask
alicia
i
have
just
read
in
prices
that
a
copy
was
sold
by
in
london
for
one
hundred
pounds
already
i
murmured
and
i
was
lost
in
admiration
not
of
the
accretion
in
am
used
to
of
the
facility
in
acquiring
the
interest
and
the
jargon
of
my
hobby
oh
andrews
must
have
a
wonderful
place
she
exclaimed
that
must
be
a
splendid
business
where
is
he
how
love
to
see
it
you
shall
some
day
alicia
i
told
her
he
is
in
street
and
an
excellent
fellow
he
is
i
then
explained
to
her
how
andrews
had
insisted
upon
planting
the
book
on
my
shelves
alicia
gazed
at
me
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
tears
glittered
in
her
eyes
because
of
us
she
said
with
a
quivering
lip
because
we
came
that
you
buy
it
talk
rubbish
alicia
i
flared
at
her
a
collector
gets
almost
as
much
pleasure
in
thinking
of
books
he
get
as
in
those
he
buys
you
think
you
alone
are
worth
more
to
me
than
an
old
boswell
no
she
murmured
gloomily
but
going
to
try
to
be
many
months
have
passed
since
i
last
made
an
entry
in
this
which
i
mean
to
be
a
record
of
my
life
for
later
years
when
i
am
grown
old
and
white
and
memory
gives
back
vividly
only
the
days
of
childhood
it
must
be
that
the
stoking
of
the
furnace
below
all
winter
or
else
my
absorption
in
has
banished
reflection
upon
events
from
out
of
my
mind
it
is
not
reflection
that
was
banished
however
but
only
the
energy
to
record
it
the
folk
who
work
the
treadmill
leave
few
records
behind
them
and
i
am
of
the
treadmill
occupant
of
an
office
chair
one
of
the
gray
mass
of
dwellers
in
the
suburbs
of
life
the
office
of
that
was
at
first
like
a
queer
old
wharf
in
some
foreign
city
to
a
ship
from
distant
parts
has
grown
familiar
and
almost
homelike
so
that
i
feel
the
barnacles
gathering
about
my
hulk
at
the
mooring
place
it
is
ever
the
same
i
come
and
i
labor
and
i
go
the
chair
and
the
desk
await
me
of
a
morning
and
by
ten
it
is
as
though
i
had
never
left
them
i
go
forth
of
an
afternoon
into
freedom
and
feel
a
momentary
desire
to
wander
about
as
of
old
the
bland
frontages
of
new
york
still
have
a
lure
for
me
but
the
nestlings
for
whom
i
am
laboring
are
at
crestlands
and
to
them
i
automatically
hasten
my
steps
but
is
all
that
about
to
end
for
the
first
time
since
his
disappearance
i
heard
of
poor
husband
for
i
have
received
an
astonishing
letter
from
dibdin
and
it
is
that
i
suppose
which
has
stirred
me
to
writing
again
be
prepared
letter
begins
after
his
usual
abrupt
manner
be
prepared
for
a
sort
of
shock
a
week
ago
i
arrived
in
yokohama
with
half
a
of
stocks
and
stones
carvings
idols
homeward
bound
if
you
have
ever
been
in
yokohama
you
will
remember
the
grand
hotel
on
the
bund
yes
i
do
remember
it
was
the
one
bright
spot
for
me
in
japan
on
my
brief
and
disappointing
journey
six
years
ago
heaven
knows
why
i
went
there
once
i
had
viewed
the
temples
at
nikko
the
sacred
deer
on
the
island
of
miyajima
and
the
volcanic
cone
of
fujiyama
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
i
am
not
an
ethnologist
and
there
were
no
bookshops
while
awaiting
my
steamer
the
only
refuge
was
that
grand
hotel
at
yokohama
where
you
can
still
sit
in
a
chair
facing
a
window
as
commercial
travelers
in
provincial
hotels
in
america
sit
and
look
out
across
the
water
towards
tokio
and
smoke
and
idle
and
gossip
of
an
afternoon
there
is
tea
with
excellent
little
by
japanese
girls
in
kimonos
so
gorgeous
that
even
a
geisha
would
be
too
modest
to
wear
them
in
the
street
the
color
however
is
meant
for
western
eyes
the
ladies
american
and
english
from
tokio
and
thereabout
wives
of
commission
merchants
agents
naval
officers
diplomats
tourists
gather
around
and
do
what
they
can
to
annihilate
reputations
is
the
way
the
world
over
there
is
also
a
longest
in
asia
incidentally
every
bar
in
the
east
is
the
longest
and
men
from
hongkong
shanghai
peking
kobe
and
yokohama
carry
the
measurements
of
their
respective
bars
in
their
heads
for
purposes
of
competitive
argument
we
all
need
something
to
brag
about
and
little
else
in
those
parts
when
the
ladies
have
finished
their
tea
and
have
gone
to
their
rooms
or
their
the
bar
at
the
grand
is
the
next
halting
stage
for
the
men
i
have
not
thought
of
it
for
years
though
it
is
vivid
enough
to
me
now
it
is
one
of
the
five
points
on
the
globe
where
if
you
loiter
long
enough
you
are
certain
to
encounter
every
one
you
ever
knew
if
you
remember
this
setting
runs
letter
you
will
realize
how
easy
it
was
even
for
a
bear
like
me
to
pick
up
quickly
the
gossip
of
the
place
and
incidentally
the
legend
of
patterson
patterson
i
learned
was
a
drifter
an
idler
a
gambler
and
a
staunch
support
of
the
grand
bar
he
is
adroit
suave
pleasant
american
some
trader
found
him
on
the
beach
in
the
marquesas
took
him
along
for
company
among
the
islands
and
ultimately
landed
him
here
he
has
traded
in
skins
in
silk
in
insurance
is
said
to
have
all
but
killed
a
man
in
a
card
brawl
and
has
cleaned
out
many
a
tourist
at
poker
now
he
is
no
longer
allowed
to
play
cards
at
the
grand
i
had
a
curiosity
to
see
this
bird
of
plumage
and
two
days
ago
mainwaring
the
excellent
manager
of
this
hotel
pointed
him
out
to
me
judge
of
my
amazement
as
novelists
say
when
i
recognized
in
patterson
none
other
than
the
author
of
all
your
troubles
your
vanished
will
it
surprise
you
to
learn
that
my
first
emotion
was
a
desire
to
rush
upon
him
as
he
leaned
across
the
bar
and
drive
a
knife
into
his
back
instead
however
i
got
mainwaring
to
introduce
me
and
if
pendleton
was
surprised
he
concealed
it
successfully
presently
he
was
drinking
my
liquor
and
chattering
about
the
islands
from
which
i
am
a
recent
arrival
if
i
disguised
the
cold
rage
i
felt
against
the
man
you
must
give
me
credit
for
more
diplomacy
than
you
ordinarily
do
talk
like
a
new
yorker
i
presently
let
fall
in
a
casual
manner
there
you
have
me
he
threw
out
in
a
blandly
mysterious
sort
of
way
is
i
know
where
i
come
from
in
short
he
tried
on
the
lapsed
memory
sort
of
thing
woke
up
one
day
to
find
himself
at
manila
know
his
own
name
or
who
he
was
or
whence
initials
on
his
linen
were
so
he
took
the
name
of
good
as
any
other
and
so
forth
very
sad
but
then
one
must
take
life
as
one
finds
it
some
of
us
are
elected
to
martyrdom
in
this
world
that
you
understand
was
his
drift
i
told
him
calmly
you
really
want
to
know
who
you
are
i
can
tell
he
turned
i
thought
a
shade
paler
but
he
played
his
part
smoothly
mean
it
he
exclaimed
with
a
quite
seraphic
ecstasy
know
me
my
god
man
you
are
my
deliverer
come
at
last
are
jim
pendleton
i
told
him
quietly
and
then
i
told
him
a
few
other
things
my
reasoning
was
like
this
if
he
is
the
thorough
hound
i
thought
he
was
he
would
have
an
excellent
chance
of
good
riddance
if
there
was
a
shred
of
decency
left
in
the
man
now
was
the
time
for
it
to
show
well
he
surprised
me
i
saw
real
tears
in
his
eyes
he
begged
for
every
detail
i
could
give
him
his
voice
broke
when
he
tried
to
ask
questions
about
laura
and
the
kids
he
has
not
bolted
he
is
quite
pathetically
attached
to
me
i
am
dashed
if
i
can
tell
whether
real
or
not
i
believe
for
a
minute
in
the
lapsed
memory
dodge
but
i
am
flabbergasted
he
seems
so
pitifully
keen
for
every
scrap
i
can
tell
him
maybe
the
poor
brute
is
really
ashamed
of
his
past
and
is
trying
only
to
save
his
face
under
this
rigmarole
of
lost
identity
he
clings
to
me
and
i
have
him
so
to
speak
under
observation
if
it
should
even
seem
remotely
possible
to
make
a
man
of
him
again
you
think
the
risk
of
bringing
him
home
might
be
worth
taking
i
know
i
know
i
shall
use
the
best
judgment
got
about
me
but
for
a
moment
think
let
you
down
your
interest
thinking
of
and
the
interest
of
the
kids
i
leave
here
for
several
weeks
yet
that
ought
to
give
me
time
to
take
his
measure
i
know
what
he
has
been
question
is
can
a
leopard
change
his
spots
or
a
beachcomber
his
character
see
randolph
my
boy
see
what
we
see
hard
luck
is
hard
luck
but
this
i
tell
you
there
is
such
a
thing
to
be
sure
as
trying
back
like
to
have
a
second
chance
myself
if
i
behaved
like
a
villain
but
of
this
fellow
i
am
far
from
sure
i
will
say
though
that
drinking
less
and
trying
to
keep
decent
not
only
in
my
own
sight
but
to
the
surprise
of
all
the
white
colony
here
you
will
hear
from
me
again
before
long
as
i
read
i
felt
gradually
overshadowed
by
the
immense
somber
fact
conveyed
in
this
letter
it
was
like
a
black
cloud
bank
that
comes
up
swiftly
blotting
out
the
sun
from
over
the
landscape
it
was
not
a
thing
to
blink
to
wave
aside
or
to
dismiss
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
it
was
instant
and
tyrannous
demanding
anew
urgent
thought
and
decision
fortunately
i
am
no
longer
the
same
creature
that
was
bodily
hurled
from
tranquillity
and
leisure
like
a
monk
from
his
cell
into
the
cold
ways
of
life
i
seem
a
little
less
like
chaff
in
the
breeze
my
backbone
seemed
actually
to
stiffen
and
settle
as
i
posed
the
problem
the
problem
is
the
fate
of
the
children
to
receive
and
pendleton
means
to
give
them
up
did
i
not
assume
their
care
only
because
there
was
none
else
now
there
would
might
one
else
pendleton
has
a
legal
right
to
his
own
children
and
if
he
could
establish
it
satisfactorily
no
doubt
a
moral
right
as
well
the
advent
of
pendleton
might
prove
to
have
incalculable
advantages
for
myself
here
on
the
one
side
is
the
treadmill
on
the
other
there
is
or
there
was
ease
and
leisure
and
dreams
my
small
competency
is
gone
in
the
wake
of
that
destructive
progress
but
for
myself
i
might
manage
an
easier
and
more
agreeable
way
of
subsisting
than
the
way
of
those
are
the
cold
facts
clearly
somehow
they
will
not
let
me
rest
my
world
has
been
violently
jarred
for
all
my
painful
calmness
and
i
seem
unable
to
fit
the
parts
again
into
exactly
the
old
solidity
of
groove
and
joint
there
are
lurking
interstices
which
i
can
not
fill
who
is
the
hero
of
an
unforgettable
tale
was
wont
to
ask
himself
and
he
felt
his
soul
floating
off
and
dipping
into
the
infinite
likewise
i
ask
myself
now
who
is
randolph
byrd
and
the
startling
truth
returns
that
the
children
in
my
house
and
i
are
inseparable
that
i
and
they
are
one
with
this
and
the
fact
that
pendleton
is
in
all
likelihood
coming
back
to
claim
them
i
am
pending
further
news
from
dibdin
left
to
grapple
at
any
rate
dibdin
also
is
returning
it
is
now
the
spring
and
the
year
is
beginning
to
smile
again
i
have
been
prospering
at
and
my
income
is
now
again
the
same
as
it
was
before
ever
the
children
came
to
i
became
a
business
man
but
there
is
not
a
soul
to
whom
i
can
confide
my
new
dilemma
there
is
minot
blackden
the
glass
stainer
whom
i
have
finally
discovered
to
be
a
near
neighbor
of
to
be
exact
his
studio
and
living
quarters
are
in
king
street
and
we
sometimes
have
our
lunch
together
but
blackden
is
so
much
in
the
grip
of
his
medieval
art
that
it
gets
into
his
food
stains
his
tapering
hands
and
even
spatters
upon
his
finely
pointed
beard
all
he
can
see
in
me
is
the
philistine
who
has
cast
all
else
aside
for
the
sizzling
fleshpots
when
i
chanced
to
mention
having
four
children
in
my
house
he
looked
upon
me
as
a
might
look
upon
a
polar
bear
i
was
to
him
a
visible
but
incredible
symbol
of
something
strange
and
gross
there
is
nothing
placid
or
resigned
about
blackden
he
is
intense
incandescent
do
you
realize
he
said
to
me
that
i
am
restoring
a
lost
art
to
the
world
but
does
it
give
you
food
i
asked
him
what
does
food
matter
he
expostulated
what
does
anything
else
in
the
world
matter
nevertheless
he
was
eager
to
take
up
my
suggestion
concerning
the
writing
of
a
booklet
upon
his
new
craft
and
he
has
been
sending
it
out
broadcast
but
so
intensely
devotional
is
his
attitude
to
the
whole
business
that
i
have
not
the
face
to
suggest
payment
for
the
work
nor
has
he
referred
to
it
again
i
know
little
of
his
art
but
i
know
that
his
returns
are
increasing
it
is
obvious
that
i
can
not
burden
a
soul
burning
with
that
gemlike
flame
of
with
any
such
confidence
as
the
impending
return
of
pendleton
at
times
i
think
that
minot
blackden
and
gertrude
bayard
ought
to
marry
each
other
they
are
both
so
and
so
absolutely
sure
of
themselves
but
in
the
meantime
there
is
no
one
i
can
talk
to
no
one
walking
to
grand
central
station
these
brilliant
afternoons
is
a
thing
i
can
not
resist
it
is
the
only
exercise
i
get
crossing
washington
square
i
strike
into
fifth
avenue
and
by
the
time
i
reach
fourteenth
street
i
have
a
delicious
sense
of
losing
myself
of
merging
into
the
crowd
that
is
very
soothing
after
a
day
in
the
office
there
is
nothing
so
stimulating
as
the
energetic
crowd
in
fifth
avenue
at
bookstore
i
usually
pause
and
scrutinize
the
window
i
am
very
sound
in
the
latest
novels
and
the
newest
developments
in
stationery
as
my
eyes
were
feasting
on
the
cover
jacket
of
arnold
latest
a
lady
coming
down
the
avenue
likewise
paused
before
the
window
and
as
we
glanced
at
each
other
i
found
i
was
facing
gertrude
of
course
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
cut
me
she
smiled
uncertainly
instead
and
put
out
her
hand
hello
ranny
she
murmured
casually
no
reason
why
we
meet
as
friends
is
there
not
the
least
in
the
world
i
returned
hastily
why
should
there
be
i
of
course
you
always
were
a
sensible
person
i
grinned
in
my
guilty
fashion
how
is
everything
she
continued
brightly
i
your
firm
you
in
business
now
i
mentioned
my
connection
with
banca
e
casa
commerciale
a
sort
of
hero
of
romance
she
smiled
speculatively
over
my
head
and
the
kiddies
she
added
they
all
right
going
strong
she
made
no
reference
to
alicia
but
i
thought
it
only
decent
not
to
leave
her
in
doubt
everything
in
my
household
is
about
the
same
i
said
she
nodded
the
years
of
our
friendship
flashed
through
my
mind
with
a
sense
of
regret
at
the
passing
and
crumbling
of
human
relations
gertrude
would
quite
naturally
have
been
the
one
i
could
have
talked
to
concerning
the
probable
return
of
pendleton
then
on
a
sudden
occurred
one
of
those
coincidences
which
invariably
surprise
me
for
what
gertrude
uttered
quite
carelessly
as
though
merely
to
fill
the
conversational
pause
was
this
no
news
of
their
father
i
suppose
i
have
never
yet
lied
to
gertrude
i
detest
lies
in
general
i
was
silent
my
face
must
have
betrayed
me
gertrude
glanced
into
my
eyes
and
in
a
startled
voice
she
queried
you
briefly
without
going
into
detail
i
told
her
why
ranny
she
exclaimed
with
a
new
manner
in
a
new
voice
the
most
wonderful
thing
i
ever
heard
wonderful
the
greatest
luck
for
you
your
troubles
will
be
over
ah
will
they
i
speculated
ruefully
rubbing
my
cheek
the
problem
shall
i
be
able
to
trust
the
children
to
him
again
be
she
retorted
in
almost
her
old
manner
the
responsibility
will
make
a
man
of
him
again
have
to
they
are
his
i
should
think
jump
for
joy
at
the
relief
dear
me
what
a
story
must
beg
you
to
mention
a
word
of
this
to
any
one
i
stammered
you
a
ticklish
the
sake
be
absurd
she
retorted
impatiently
i
blab
will
you
promise
to
let
me
hear
things
come
out
i
promised
at
this
moment
minot
blackden
his
eyes
blinded
by
visions
of
rose
windows
no
doubt
bore
down
and
all
but
collided
with
us
i
introduced
them
mechanically
to
mitigate
his
apologies
and
left
them
both
bound
in
the
same
direction
southward
gertrude
waved
a
hand
gayly
expect
good
news
were
her
parting
words
so
i
have
told
some
one
i
reflected
as
i
made
my
way
toward
grand
central
and
gertrude
expressed
what
all
the
world
would
say
i
ought
to
jump
for
joy
at
the
relief
besides
i
shall
have
to
turn
them
over
to
pendleton
the
wheels
of
the
train
i
somberly
boarded
kept
insistently
repeating
the
same
opinion
in
addition
there
was
the
sickness
of
death
in
my
soul
for
the
folly
of
having
given
the
thing
away
to
gertrude
of
all
people
i
wish
i
were
not
obliged
to
parry
social
invitations
just
at
present
the
excellent
visconti
who
had
asked
me
to
dinner
two
or
three
times
during
the
winter
has
suddenly
taken
a
notion
to
ask
me
at
least
once
every
week
i
hope
i
am
not
grown
so
churlish
but
that
i
appreciate
his
courtesy
but
the
fag
is
too
great
he
has
a
house
in
thirteenth
street
neighboring
on
hospital
and
he
also
has
a
motherless
daughter
gina
abounding
in
vitality
who
must
be
amused
the
proximity
to
the
hospital
he
intimates
the
smell
of
carbolate
and
iodoform
depress
young
blood
and
gina
being
must
not
be
allowed
to
remember
that
there
is
anything
unpleasant
in
life
i
trust
i
am
not
the
only
vessel
chosen
to
bring
more
lively
spirits
to
that
girl
the
effort
for
me
is
immense
i
go
to
crestlands
after
office
hours
dress
return
to
town
and
then
make
a
late
train
for
crestlands
again
the
food
is
excellent
and
gina
sings
prettily
in
a
soprano
as
rich
as
her
coloring
but
the
next
morning
does
not
enjoy
the
fruit
of
my
undimmed
energies
more
recently
visconti
has
urged
me
not
to
dress
and
in
that
i
see
the
fine
hand
of
gina
at
work
as
an
girl
gina
is
quick
and
eager
to
read
the
signs
and
weather
indications
and
though
i
am
becoming
dexterous
in
excuses
i
dined
at
the
last
night
nevertheless
gina
sang
the
and
voce
poco
and
even
told
my
fortune
in
cards
predicting
that
i
should
be
married
a
second
time
but
never
a
first
time
i
queried
simply
oh
then
never
been
married
at
all
gina
exulted
and
she
energetically
read
the
cards
for
me
afresh
her
sortilege
evidently
is
not
a
perfect
science
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
by
means
of
it
the
clever
gina
found
out
more
about
my
personal
life
than
ever
i
had
vouchsafed
to
her
in
all
our
acquaintance
when
i
returned
home
i
found
alicia
in
my
study
sitting
late
over
the
catalogue
a
copy
of
which
she
is
now
completing
she
jumped
from
her
chair
oh
i
am
so
glad
come
uncle
ranny
she
clapped
her
hands
joyously
i
have
found
something
we
have
overlooked
what
is
it
alicia
and
my
gaze
was
i
admit
fascinated
by
her
flushed
cheeks
and
starlike
eyes
sparkling
with
excitement
she
seemed
the
muse
incarnating
those
books
the
very
spirit
of
beauty
they
enshrine
and
yet
she
is
not
quite
sixteen
she
cried
and
so
thin
that
it
had
slipped
in
between
the
covers
of
another
book
a
first
it
yes
alicia
and
a
very
beautiful
poem
besides
oh
it
she
cried
in
exultation
i
have
read
it
all
uncle
ranny
and
do
you
know
what
i
found
out
her
voice
became
more
it
is
your
life
shelley
was
writing
i
laughed
uproariously
yes
he
did
flashed
alicia
only
your
life
is
so
much
better
he
was
so
absorbed
in
himself
alastor
that
he
died
in
his
loneliness
and
are
simply
surrounded
by
people
who
love
you
and
then
i
regret
to
record
overtook
alicia
she
became
aware
of
her
own
vehemence
and
blushing
furiously
made
as
if
to
run
out
of
the
room
my
position
of
vantage
near
the
door
enabled
me
to
stop
her
wait
my
dear
i
endeavored
to
lift
her
lowered
chin
enthusiasm
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
one
of
the
finest
things
in
life
and
tell
you
are
always
applying
to
ourselves
everything
we
read
in
books
that
murmured
alicia
shamefacedly
why
people
love
books
foolish
wake
the
sleeping
pedant
in
me
not
altogether
alicia
when
we
get
older
we
become
less
personal
i
love
books
because
they
hold
the
truth
and
the
wisdom
of
minds
and
aside
from
life
and
love
alicia
wisdom
and
truth
are
the
greatest
realities
in
the
world
there
is
death
of
course
but
who
cares
to
dwell
upon
death
i
always
did
think
that
life
were
greater
than
books
stammered
alicia
earnestly
and
now
that
you
yourself
say
so
i
am
sure
of
it
astonishing
child
when
has
she
had
the
time
to
speculate
upon
the
magnitude
of
life
and
love
always
that
young
thing
keeps
revealing
herself
to
me
afresh
i
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
here
was
a
better
counselor
than
any
one
dibdin
excepted
with
whom
i
might
discuss
the
impending
return
of
pendleton
alicia
i
began
in
another
tone
there
is
something
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
about
criminally
late
i
know
and
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
but
since
you
will
dissipate
on
the
catalogue
keep
you
up
a
little
longer
i
led
her
back
to
a
chair
and
she
gazed
at
me
is
it
anything
she
whispered
somewhat
frightened
a
is
about
the
children
but
more
particularly
it
is
about
their
father
have
you
ever
heard
of
him
their
father
thought
he
was
dead
she
murmured
there
were
times
when
we
all
thought
so
he
disappeared
some
years
ago
but
alive
alicia
just
heard
from
dibdin
who
found
him
in
japan
her
eyes
grew
wider
how
terrible
she
breathed
does
he
know
has
happened
he
does
course
he
until
dibdin
told
him
and
then
this
occurred
to
me
ought
i
to
shield
pendleton
to
the
extent
of
telling
her
positively
that
he
had
lost
his
memory
or
identity
no
a
confidant
deserves
scrupulous
honesty
even
if
that
confidant
be
as
young
as
alicia
he
told
dibdin
i
went
on
that
he
lost
his
memory
of
the
past
and
found
himself
one
day
stranded
in
manila
led
rather
a
wild
and
worthless
life
who
lose
their
memories
seem
to
do
that
do
you
think
true
she
queried
i
know
alicia
but
when
he
comes
back
i
suppose
have
to
accept
that
version
dibdin
will
have
some
advice
on
that
point
i
feel
sure
alicia
remained
silent
for
a
time
lost
in
reflection
her
face
in
her
perturbation
was
the
face
of
a
grown
woman
do
you
think
want
to
take
back
the
children
uncle
ranny
the
crux
of
the
whole
matter
alicia
i
know
but
if
he
does
have
a
right
to
do
so
of
course
they
are
his
oh
oh
and
her
hands
flew
up
to
her
face
in
a
gesture
of
poignant
despair
turn
them
over
to
such
a
man
is
that
the
way
the
arranged
i
smiled
gloomily
i
saw
that
there
was
no
need
of
comment
upon
the
arrangement
of
the
world
this
girl
young
in
her
teens
understood
it
as
well
as
any
one
then
have
to
go
too
she
uttered
hoarsely
with
a
dry
sob
of
bitterness
in
her
throat
not
necessarily
i
interposed
oh
yes
i
should
she
insisted
doggedly
as
though
driving
something
painful
into
her
flesh
but
it
matter
about
me
but
uncle
ranny
you
give
them
up
all
so
happy
here
little
jimmie
and
laura
and
randolph
what
chance
would
they
have
of
growing
up
from
a
man
like
that
you
let
them
you
oh
it
would
be
horrible
horrible
she
ended
passionately
listen
my
dear
i
tried
to
calm
her
i
had
no
wish
to
harrow
your
feelings
i
told
you
because
you
love
the
we
must
face
all
this
together
i
shall
want
your
help
your
support
she
flashed
a
sweet
look
mingled
of
pride
and
gratitude
after
all
been
through
she
murmured
incoherently
but
why
you
do
this
uncle
ranny
and
with
the
quick
transition
possible
to
youth
she
was
again
alive
eager
excited
this
little
fellow
conspirator
of
mine
why
you
let
him
come
here
and
live
right
in
this
house
for
a
while
be
awfully
crowded
she
ran
on
with
flushed
energy
but
find
room
for
him
and
be
awfully
nice
to
believe
everything
he
says
then
we
could
watch
him
and
i
just
know
find
out
whether
all
right
or
not
i
laughed
at
her
enthusiasm
you
forget
alicia
i
informed
her
that
even
if
he
prove
all
right
he
is
still
the
father
of
those
children
i
care
she
returned
stoutly
if
bad
and
sees
that
we
see
bad
he
have
the
face
to
take
them
away
from
here
even
a
bad
father
wants
his
children
to
be
all
right
and
how
in
the
world
do
you
know
that
you
astounding
infant
oh
i
know
with
a
triumphant
laugh
at
the
fathers
brought
their
children
and
of
them
he
was
so
bad
he
think
he
was
fit
to
have
a
child
near
him
i
had
tiptoed
into
the
office
and
i
heard
him
perhaps
he
want
to
support
the
brat
i
scoffed
to
cover
up
my
wonder
well
and
do
you
think
he
will
alicia
snatched
at
my
words
a
man
who
ran
away
from
them
loafing
round
for
years
oh
it
will
be
easy
uncle
ranny
she
chuckled
he
fool
us
and
why
my
little
portia
he
because
said
alicia
thoughtfully
he
will
always
be
thinking
of
himself
and
you
mean
i
pressed
delightedly
be
and
give
himself
away
the
while
we
are
clothed
in
our
rectitude
yes
she
cried
with
a
laugh
be
thinking
of
jimmie
and
laura
and
always
easier
to
think
what
to
do
when
thinking
of
somebody
of
yourself
and
did
you
discover
that
also
in
the
office
at
the
home
i
leaned
toward
her
in
amazement
no
she
bent
her
gaze
downward
i
learned
that
right
here
i
kissed
alicia
upon
the
cheek
it
lies
heavy
at
my
door
that
i
have
shown
her
too
little
affection
in
the
past
merely
because
she
is
not
related
to
me
it
startled
me
to
realize
that
dear
to
me
as
children
are
alicia
is
the
dearest
of
them
all
as
with
a
gentle
good
night
she
slipped
away
a
profound
sigh
of
relief
escaped
me
that
child
succeeded
in
almost
wholly
blotting
out
my
feeling
of
bitter
perplexity
after
talking
with
gertrude
do
alicias
upon
growing
older
turn
into
gertrudes
i
wonder
no
i
think
not
surely
not
i
now
look
to
the
return
of
pendleton
almost
with
equanimity
i
am
agitated
like
a
hen
with
a
newly
hatched
brood
it
has
suddenly
been
revealed
to
me
that
the
complacency
with
which
i
have
been
regarding
my
care
and
rearing
of
the
children
is
abysmally
false
and
wholly
unjustified
they
are
not
properly
clothed
for
new
york
and
even
here
in
crestlands
they
seem
on
a
sudden
pitifully
shabby
the
competition
in
that
sort
of
thing
in
a
suburb
is
keen
children
seem
better
dressed
than
my
own
and
yet
do
what
i
will
i
can
not
afford
to
spend
more
dignity
is
positively
impaired
by
clothes
which
he
is
constantly
outgrowing
and
the
rate
at
which
jimmie
wears
out
trousers
and
soils
white
suits
is
simply
unbelievable
laura
alone
seems
to
have
the
gift
of
always
keeping
her
things
fresh
and
wearing
them
as
though
they
were
new
as
for
alicia
that
girl
ought
to
be
clothed
in
purple
at
least
figuratively
if
only
i
could
afford
it
it
seems
to
me
i
can
not
live
another
day
unless
i
procure
for
alicia
a
large
collection
of
frocks
and
blouses
and
shoes
and
whatever
else
would
set
off
that
faunlike
creature
compact
of
energy
and
grace
for
almost
daily
that
child
grows
more
beautiful
in
a
way
that
pulls
at
my
heartstrings
i
trust
i
am
no
idiotic
parent
or
foster
parent
to
rave
about
her
eyes
and
complexion
and
the
like
i
am
as
dispassionate
as
any
one
can
well
be
but
truly
there
is
something
starlike
in
her
eyes
and
at
times
when
she
is
sewing
or
reading
or
working
on
my
eternal
catalogue
i
surprise
her
pensive
absorbed
in
some
long
thoughts
of
her
own
that
not
for
worlds
would
i
disturb
at
such
moments
i
am
absolutely
fascinated
by
those
soft
pools
of
light
that
irradiate
her
face
are
other
girls
like
that
at
her
age
i
wonder
it
seems
scarcely
conceivable
at
any
rate
i
have
never
seen
any
others
like
her
but
then
i
have
seen
so
few
the
truth
remains
however
that
i
positively
must
dress
her
better
even
my
dull
fancy
joyously
leaps
at
the
vision
of
alicia
beautifully
dressed
and
diffusing
sweetness
and
fragrance
through
the
house
of
course
i
can
not
single
her
out
there
is
laura
too
and
it
might
seem
invidious
although
as
the
eldest
of
them
all
alicia
is
entitled
to
especial
consideration
i
can
not
moreover
allow
pendleton
to
observe
that
i
have
kept
his
children
shabby
few
are
the
claims
that
pendleton
can
legitimately
array
against
me
but
the
shabbiness
of
the
children
would
too
flagrantly
proclaim
my
failure
nor
does
dibdin
know
as
yet
my
progress
since
fred
salmon
made
a
business
man
of
me
but
where
am
i
to
get
the
money
for
clothes
when
the
mere
routine
of
subsistence
absorbs
it
all
there
is
still
yellowing
cheque
intact
but
i
can
not
use
have
it
i
shall
sell
alastor
since
i
had
overlooked
it
i
shall
merely
assume
i
never
had
it
in
its
rivière
binding
alastor
should
bring
at
least
two
hundred
dollars
and
may
bring
more
heaven
knows
it
cost
me
more
it
holds
some
marginal
memoranda
by
leigh
hunt
which
should
not
detract
from
its
value
since
alicia
opines
that
my
life
is
more
laudable
than
because
there
are
those
who
love
me
she
shall
profit
by
her
judgment
alastor
shall
be
sacrificed
for
her
soft
and
lovely
frocks
sooner
or
later
i
had
to
come
to
it
what
is
a
volume
more
or
less
compared
to
the
happiness
of
a
household
i
am
glad
i
have
decided
this
so
farewell
alastor
spirit
of
solitude
i
seem
to
be
possessed
by
the
mad
feverish
spirit
of
carnival
having
sold
my
alastor
by
means
of
an
advertisement
in
the
sunday
for
two
hundred
and
dollars
i
experienced
a
sensation
of
richer
blood
in
my
veins
by
that
accession
of
wealth
alastor
has
clothed
all
my
family
i
am
sorry
for
the
old
woman
who
lived
in
a
shoe
she
possessed
no
library
the
moral
is
obvious
what
though
i
parted
with
a
little
bit
of
myself
when
i
parted
with
that
book
i
have
engrafted
something
else
in
its
place
for
the
children
also
are
myself
i
do
not
delegate
griselda
any
more
to
do
the
buying
for
them
first
i
took
jimmie
and
randolph
to
a
outfitting
shop
where
the
atmosphere
is
august
alicia
offered
to
come
along
but
though
jimmie
is
hotly
attached
to
her
he
was
vocal
with
objections
this
is
business
he
cried
and
us
men
must
go
alone
men
corrected
laura
laughing
and
kissing
him
men
know
how
to
talk
he
retorted
violently
rubbing
the
kiss
from
his
cheek
kisses
he
implied
were
all
very
well
in
their
place
but
not
at
important
crises
in
masculine
lives
not
when
the
was
hanging
grandly
from
their
shoulders
come
on
old
man
randolph
interposed
with
a
wink
in
my
direction
and
wrath
was
appeased
the
old
man
soothed
and
uplifted
him
to
the
proper
pitch
of
virile
dignity
the
dollars
laid
out
upon
those
two
boys
have
given
me
more
satisfaction
than
anything
else
i
spent
the
balance
upon
the
girls
shops
are
prosaic
and
dull
compared
with
those
greek
temples
that
line
fifth
avenue
with
feminine
apparel
as
the
paymaster
for
the
boys
i
was
unnoticed
as
the
uncle
of
the
two
girls
opening
the
door
to
desire
i
was
an
object
of
almost
affectionate
solicitude
to
the
saleswoman
they
were
alert
to
help
and
advise
what
a
freemasonry
an
empire
within
an
empire
is
the
domain
of
clothes
in
the
latest
slang
and
in
words
from
shakespeare
the
jaded
saleswomen
were
eager
to
interpret
my
wishes
i
want
some
frocks
and
things
for
these
girls
i
announced
boldly
in
one
of
the
great
shops
not
too
expensive
but
things
nice
girls
ought
to
wear
i
know
nasally
asserted
an
efficient
blonde
ceasing
her
mastication
and
mysteriously
secreting
what
she
was
chewing
somewhere
in
her
capacious
mouth
nice
and
quiet
know
neat
but
not
gaudy
put
in
her
more
pallid
more
cultured
companion
with
a
faded
smile
to
complete
the
specification
so
i
murmured
and
laura
seemed
to
experience
a
difficulty
in
restraining
herself
from
giggling
alicia
however
with
the
simple
directness
that
is
hers
proceeded
quietly
to
mention
voiles
and
organdies
and
soon
the
discussion
became
technical
and
i
helpless
i
thought
it
wise
to
whisper
to
alicia
the
amount
of
money
at
her
disposal
she
gasped
her
astonishment
with
a
blush
and
then
a
beautiful
light
of
gratitude
and
pleasure
leaped
into
her
eyes
and
i
believe
the
child
was
going
to
cry
i
turned
away
quickly
and
steadily
she
proceeded
with
the
business
in
hand
to
the
lady
who
quoted
polonius
the
neat
but
not
gaudy
one
i
intrusted
the
selection
of
those
things
that
i
was
not
to
see
she
was
sincerely
gratified
at
my
confidence
and
i
believe
conscientious
there
was
just
about
enough
change
left
for
refreshments
at
for
the
girls
and
paterfamilias
gay
were
the
spirits
in
which
we
three
traveled
homeward
how
ridiculous
gertrude
would
make
me
if
she
knew
it
i
felt
excitement
and
happiness
bounding
in
my
veins
a
new
quality
of
those
emotions
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
experienced
before
and
my
heart
positively
missed
a
beat
when
the
crushing
thought
struck
me
must
i
now
lose
these
young
creatures
and
pass
again
into
the
emptiness
of
life
we
americans
are
like
the
french
in
that
we
think
our
climate
the
best
in
the
world
or
if
not
the
best
at
least
so
far
superior
to
many
others
that
like
the
french
we
are
steeped
in
vanity
about
it
of
saturdays
i
reach
home
early
after
midday
yet
it
has
been
persistently
and
infallibly
raining
every
saturday
afternoon
the
entire
blessed
spring
if
perchance
i
want
to
take
a
walk
and
breathe
some
air
i
can
not
stir
out
of
the
house
yet
a
nervous
restlessness
possesses
me
i
must
have
some
diversion
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
to
ask
the
girls
to
put
on
their
various
new
frocks
that
came
last
evening
for
a
moment
i
was
a
little
ashamed
at
the
thought
but
at
bottom
i
suppose
every
male
is
a
persian
ahasuerus
desirous
of
displaying
and
gloating
over
the
beauty
of
his
women
folk
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
the
king
secretly
admired
vashti
even
though
he
was
wroth
at
her
disobedience
laura
it
appeared
was
in
the
next
street
at
the
house
of
a
school
friend
but
alicia
complied
eagerly
displaying
anything
but
the
suffragette
indignation
of
vashti
she
was
in
fact
eager
to
parade
her
frocks
with
quite
feminine
excitement
in
her
clinging
voile
in
organdie
in
white
slippers
and
silk
stockings
alicia
appeared
vision
surprising
disturbingly
radiant
with
youthful
charm
there
was
something
with
a
blue
sash
that
made
her
simply
exquisite
the
very
incarnation
of
grace
her
hair
gathered
tightly
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
and
then
spreading
out
into
a
great
brush
a
cloud
of
shimmering
fine
gold
on
her
shoulders
seemed
the
only
mark
of
childhood
left
that
prevented
me
from
being
like
another
anthony
miserably
afraid
of
her
i
know
not
what
devil
possessed
me
to
ask
her
to
go
and
put
up
her
hair
before
she
took
off
that
frock
how
different
must
have
been
the
character
of
queen
for
alicia
ran
out
of
the
room
and
almost
in
a
twinkling
she
was
back
with
her
hair
up
i
sat
for
a
moment
staring
at
her
speechless
and
for
before
me
flushed
and
sparkling
stood
the
most
adorable
young
creature
i
had
ever
seen
why
should
there
be
so
much
mystery
in
feminine
hair
i
blurted
out
finally
in
a
sort
of
choleric
tenderness
how
dare
you
look
so
grown
up
in
my
house
a
peal
of
excited
laughter
was
her
answer
and
she
made
as
if
she
would
rush
toward
me
with
open
arms
as
might
an
affectionate
child
eager
to
caress
an
indulgent
then
on
a
sadden
she
checked
herself
a
blush
suffusing
her
cheeks
and
her
very
ears
go
call
griselda
i
commanded
to
cover
her
confusion
and
show
her
the
young
woman
been
harboring
in
the
guise
of
a
child
alicia
ran
out
of
the
room
to
comply
and
for
a
moment
i
remained
sitting
in
my
chair
as
under
a
spell
then
i
rose
hastily
to
dispel
such
nonsensical
emotions
and
left
my
room
only
to
come
face
to
face
with
alicia
and
griselda
in
the
dining
room
oh
muttered
my
aging
griselda
her
swarthy
countenance
hot
from
the
kitchen
stove
looking
more
forbiddingly
sybilline
than
ever
all
over
she
added
mysteriously
what
do
you
over
i
demanded
a
little
stupidly
though
dimly
i
suppose
i
understood
her
the
young
besoms
grow
up
sae
fast
a
meeracle
they
dinna
wed
in
their
cradles
wed
i
cried
in
disgust
at
the
word
you
women
are
always
thinking
of
only
one
you
griselda
go
i
turned
to
alicia
let
down
your
hair
again
this
minute
so
you
put
such
wild
notions
into
frivolous
mind
alicia
laughed
deliciously
and
even
griselda
with
a
sort
of
dark
twisted
smile
reiterated
oh
young
besoms
whereupon
my
young
woman
impulsively
threw
her
arms
about
griselda
and
kissed
the
brown
cheek
with
gusto
griselda
returned
by
pinching
cheek
fiercely
my
nephew
randolph
and
a
companion
a
tall
gawky
boy
coming
into
the
house
at
that
moment
stood
in
their
raincoats
at
the
door
and
gaped
blocking
path
i
say
look
here
my
young
hopeful
exclaimed
with
a
low
whistle
wagging
his
head
from
side
to
side
the
other
boy
merely
stared
in
dumb
awe
twisting
his
wet
cap
in
his
fingers
that
gawk
and
alicia
are
the
same
age
difference
let
her
go
through
and
unmask
i
waved
them
aside
and
alicia
with
her
head
down
ran
laughing
out
of
the
room
i
returned
to
my
chair
and
sat
down
as
one
dazed
my
policy
henceforth
will
be
to
frown
on
suchlike
i
myself
had
instigated
this
one
what
an
occupation
for
a
man
of
books
and
who
desired
to
write
of
brunetto
add
to
the
body
of
scholarship
upon
dante
and
suddenly
i
put
my
head
down
on
my
arms
and
laughed
long
and
i
am
sure
quite
meaninglessly
for
if
i
were
a
woman
i
might
just
as
easily
have
sobbed
in
a
way
to
tear
out
the
heart
decidedly
the
suspense
of
awaiting
news
from
dibdin
regarding
pendleton
must
be
undermining
my
nerves
i
am
gey
ill
to
live
with
i
seem
to
myself
like
the
irascible
old
gentlemen
in
the
comedies
with
the
prithees
and
monstrous
fine
epigrams
forever
taking
that
there
is
no
comedy
about
me
i
take
down
books
and
i
can
not
read
them
what
pleasure
i
used
to
experience
in
leaving
some
of
the
leaves
uncut
in
fine
editions
so
as
to
cut
them
on
further
readings
i
have
tried
to
extract
that
joy
by
cutting
some
recently
but
there
is
no
joy
in
it
why
am
i
so
certain
that
pendleton
will
take
away
all
these
that
i
love
and
leave
me
desolate
all
his
past
seems
to
argue
against
the
probability
yet
constantly
i
see
before
me
the
picture
of
their
going
in
a
body
with
that
man
while
i
stand
speechless
attempting
to
smile
benignantly
how
we
dramatize
ourselves
even
the
least
imaginative
amongst
us
and
all
the
time
i
feel
as
though
great
gouts
of
blood
were
dripping
dripping
from
my
heart
in
nameless
anguish
alicia
that
divine
child
is
watching
me
unobtrusively
though
closely
whenever
she
can
she
surrounds
me
with
comforts
and
attentions
but
like
some
sick
owl
i
prefer
to
brood
alone
the
somewhat
isolated
position
of
my
châlet
on
the
rock
and
the
lack
of
a
wife
in
the
household
has
saved
me
from
making
intimate
acquaintances
among
my
crestlands
neighbors
but
there
is
one
young
man
judkins
an
architect
in
the
stucco
house
opposite
who
strides
over
to
my
porch
and
insists
upon
talking
of
his
performances
at
golf
ought
to
join
the
club
he
keeps
reiterating
nothing
like
eighteen
holes
to
take
the
kinks
outa
your
brain
after
the
hullabaloo
in
the
city
i
seem
to
have
many
kinks
i
ask
whereat
he
laughs
in
his
harsh
voice
all
got
he
cries
get
away
from
books
he
adds
explosively
books
are
no
good
they
give
you
the
willies
and
that
man
claims
to
have
studied
at
the
beaux
arts
edmond
de
goncourt
that
neurasthenic
philosopher
prayed
that
he
might
make
a
hundred
thousand
francs
from
his
play
germinie
lacerteux
so
that
he
might
buy
the
house
opposite
and
put
this
notice
on
it
to
be
let
to
people
who
have
no
children
who
do
not
play
any
musical
instrument
and
who
will
be
permitted
to
keep
only
goldfish
as
pets
as
for
me
i
should
waive
the
children
the
pets
and
the
musical
instruments
i
would
merely
say
no
proselyting
golfers
need
apply
alicia
to
mitigate
my
mood
i
suppose
devised
a
picnic
in
the
woods
no
one
was
to
come
save
the
children
and
i
and
that
gawky
companion
of
the
boy
john
purington
lest
randolph
should
be
bored
randolph
it
appears
is
easily
bored
the
consciousness
of
my
recent
hypochondriac
behavior
led
me
to
accept
the
suggestion
with
alacrity
the
luncheon
griselda
prepared
was
packed
in
paper
boxes
by
alicia
and
together
our
little
procession
set
forth
and
made
its
way
to
a
grove
less
than
two
miles
distant
bordering
on
the
great
croton
aqueduct
randolph
and
the
gawky
boy
fell
at
once
to
tossing
a
baseball
jimmie
rolled
delightedly
about
the
lush
grass
still
grappling
with
his
insoluble
problem
of
rolling
up
a
slope
and
still
perplexed
as
to
why
it
should
be
easier
to
roll
down
laura
ran
to
his
aid
and
alicia
sat
beside
me
and
laughed
that
is
the
whole
problem
of
life
that
jimmie
is
facing
i
observed
gloomily
no
it
uncle
ranny
she
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
as
she
contradicted
that
is
only
the
law
of
gravitation
there
is
a
lot
more
to
life
than
that
yes
alicia
i
lowered
my
voice
but
when
that
man
comes
how
it
will
hurt
to
think
of
little
jimmie
of
all
those
children
of
my
in
the
care
of
that
man
really
murderer
please
please
think
of
that
she
begged
with
imploring
eyes
that
happened
yet
and
manage
it
somehow
maybe
a
good
man
after
oh
watch
watch
him
besides
he
come
if
he
is
what
you
think
then
i
am
sure
he
come
that
proved
a
very
cheering
thought
before
i
knew
it
i
was
myself
tossing
a
ball
with
alicia
and
romping
with
the
rest
of
them
it
was
only
after
the
lunch
had
been
eaten
under
the
trees
and
the
egg
shells
and
papers
were
gathered
and
stowed
away
and
the
gawky
boy
proceeded
clumsily
to
monopolize
alicia
who
has
not
the
heart
to
snub
anybody
that
my
depression
returned
whereupon
alicia
gayly
proposed
that
it
was
time
to
think
of
going
home
because
jimmie
was
drowsy
and
must
not
forego
his
nap
was
it
adroitness
or
spontaneity
i
can
not
tell
but
it
is
marvelous
how
that
girl
anticipates
and
understands
it
was
a
happy
tired
company
that
returned
home
a
telegram
has
just
arrived
dibdin
and
pendleton
have
landed
in
san
francisco
pendleton
is
here
he
has
been
here
a
week
like
one
in
the
dazed
excitement
of
some
dream
the
sort
of
farrago
that
leaves
you
limp
and
weakly
smiling
when
you
wake
up
and
see
the
sun
i
have
been
going
about
with
numb
limbs
strangely
galvanized
not
so
much
into
activity
as
the
expectation
of
activity
what
is
it
i
have
been
expecting
to
happen
i
hardly
know
but
perhaps
i
have
been
expecting
melodrama
and
i
am
overcome
by
the
obvious
truism
that
genuine
melodrama
is
anything
but
melodramatic
that
is
why
melodrama
on
the
stage
with
its
ranting
and
strutting
and
flourishes
disgusts
one
by
its
bathos
the
presence
of
pendleton
in
my
house
occupying
my
bedroom
while
i
have
withdrawn
into
my
little
study
is
the
essence
of
melodrama
yet
every
one
and
everything
is
in
a
tacit
conspiracy
to
make
it
seem
natural
there
is
a
tension
in
the
atmosphere
without
doubt
but
we
are
all
of
us
madly
energetically
ignoring
it
hiding
it
the
conduct
has
been
astounding
unimpeachable
unexceptionable
he
enoch
arden
should
i
disguise
the
fact
to
hate
him
that
too
i
suppose
is
melodrama
but
do
what
i
will
he
remains
detestable
to
me
i
can
not
trust
him
i
try
however
not
to
show
it
dibdin
has
acquired
a
deep
furrow
between
the
eyes
due
doubtless
to
his
sense
of
responsibility
in
having
resuscitated
pendleton
he
carries
the
air
of
some
magician
or
sorcerer
who
has
evoked
a
demon
and
is
overwhelmed
with
terror
by
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
him
but
i
must
in
decency
acknowledge
that
behavior
has
been
without
blemish
dibdin
had
sent
me
a
long
night
letter
from
san
francisco
saying
he
would
remain
there
a
few
days
to
give
the
fellow
chance
to
bolt
if
he
wants
to
there
had
been
other
telegrams
i
was
not
to
meet
them
at
the
train
but
to
give
explicit
directions
it
was
as
well
i
could
not
have
met
pendleton
at
the
train
even
if
he
were
coming
from
the
dead
a
week
ago
when
dibdin
telephoned
from
the
city
i
went
so
far
as
to
order
a
cab
to
meet
them
there
again
the
histrionics
of
the
situation
were
at
a
hopeless
disadvantage
for
what
i
remember
most
vividly
of
that
saturday
evening
was
the
sickness
of
my
soul
as
i
sat
awaiting
their
arrival
again
and
again
i
had
steeled
myself
to
tell
the
children
of
their
coming
i
framed
words
and
sentences
in
my
mind
until
the
cold
perspiration
moistened
my
forehead
but
i
could
not
face
the
ordeal
i
had
thought
i
knew
i
was
steeled
to
the
tests
of
life
but
i
saw
i
was
still
a
reed
it
came
to
within
a
couple
of
hours
before
their
arrival
and
still
i
had
not
told
them
i
found
myself
on
my
terrace
and
a
stream
of
profanity
was
breaking
from
my
lips
on
a
sudden
i
saw
jimmie
standing
beside
me
shame
and
chagrin
overtook
me
and
i
bent
down
to
him
and
begged
him
to
forgive
me
you
mind
me
uncle
ranny
he
put
his
hand
in
mine
a
man
and
i
know
a
man
has
got
to
swear
sometimes
no
if
the
man
has
brains
enough
with
which
to
think
that
contact
with
the
child
however
seemed
to
release
something
in
my
clamped
and
aching
skull
run
jimmie
i
said
and
send
alicia
out
to
me
i
wish
to
speak
to
her
jimmie
to
whom
commissions
are
delight
was
off
like
an
arrow
some
moments
elapsed
before
alicia
could
come
to
me
and
during
that
time
i
had
a
mad
impulse
to
fly
from
it
all
to
seize
my
hat
and
steal
away
to
take
a
train
to
the
city
and
not
to
return
until
it
was
all
over
but
i
waited
nevertheless
and
alicia
who
had
been
helping
griselda
came
running
out
flushed
with
concern
in
her
eyes
alicia
i
began
miserably
i
have
tried
to
screw
up
my
courage
to
tell
the
children
about
the
coming
their
father
but
i
simply
do
it
alicia
beyond
me
want
you
to
tell
them
i
faltered
like
a
guilty
schoolboy
the
girl
winced
perceptibly
all
right
she
answered
do
you
mean
now
about
train
gets
here
at
six
you
take
them
into
the
keep
them
there
until
after
the
men
come
call
you
ranny
she
but
oh
please
worry
about
it
so
much
no
my
dear
i
murmured
and
at
that
moment
i
felt
closer
to
her
than
to
any
other
living
being
to
take
the
children
out
of
the
house
upon
the
coming
of
their
sounded
like
a
funeral
and
it
was
at
that
funeral
and
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
was
a
blur
and
the
encompassing
world
was
a
shadow
it
was
broken
no
it
was
too
insubstantial
for
breaking
it
kept
thinning
and
receding
away
from
me
and
i
was
left
a
dully
throbbing
entity
in
the
primal
chaos
before
creation
i
was
startled
at
last
by
hearing
the
wheezy
groan
of
an
aged
taxi
outside
and
like
the
galvanized
corpse
i
was
i
felt
my
members
heavily
stirring
and
propelling
me
to
the
door
on
the
path
in
the
curiously
sickly
light
of
a
premature
dusk
under
a
clouded
lifeless
sky
i
saw
dibdin
and
pendleton
slightly
stooping
forward
to
the
slope
walking
toward
me
that
moment
of
poignant
joy
at
seeing
dibdin
of
exquisite
pain
on
beholding
shall
never
forget
it
dibdin
i
cried
rushing
at
his
hand
and
clinging
to
it
to
defer
as
long
as
possible
touching
the
then
after
ages
it
seemed
my
eyes
slowly
turned
to
the
tall
figure
of
pendleton
and
rested
on
the
fleshy
face
somewhat
loose
and
pendulous
and
purplish
with
eyes
that
fell
before
my
own
finally
i
disengaged
my
hand
and
held
it
out
to
him
i
could
not
do
otherwise
jim
i
murmured
and
my
voice
had
labored
over
a
universe
of
barriers
to
achieve
that
but
i
could
utter
no
more
he
peered
at
me
from
his
protruding
eyes
as
though
he
also
were
struggling
struggling
with
memory
and
with
memories
with
a
teeming
past
with
all
that
he
had
been
and
committed
and
for
an
instant
i
felt
sorry
for
him
come
in
i
breathed
deeply
and
we
made
our
way
into
the
house
and
into
my
study
randolph
pendleton
finally
uttered
with
a
profound
sigh
and
then
i
recalled
that
he
was
playing
a
part
to
me
the
appalling
reality
of
the
whole
episode
had
been
so
excruciating
that
momentarily
i
forgot
that
he
was
in
all
likelihood
playing
a
part
but
was
he
how
could
he
in
the
face
of
these
children
in
the
face
of
all
he
is
guilty
of
how
could
he
play
a
part
when
the
truth
would
raise
him
almost
to
a
kind
of
manhood
i
can
not
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
yet
i
can
not
wholly
doubt
him
some
idiotic
simplicity
or
imbecility
inside
me
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
envisage
any
creature
in
human
form
as
so
consummate
a
villain
there
is
randolph
he
murmured
in
a
deep
i
know
remember
you
and
he
paused
we
hung
for
a
moment
like
things
dangling
by
threads
like
marionettes
motionless
then
with
a
prickling
sensation
of
sweat
over
all
my
body
i
broke
the
spell
by
fumbling
with
a
box
of
cigarettes
and
with
a
hand
spasmodically
quivering
like
the
needle
of
a
seismograph
i
held
them
out
have
a
good
voyage
i
heard
myself
saying
as
we
all
smoked
and
covertly
stole
glances
at
one
another
i
was
not
flying
at
his
throat
dibdin
puffed
heavily
with
the
crease
deepening
between
his
eyes
and
gaze
roved
questing
and
unsteady
about
the
room
melodrama
there
never
was
any
except
on
the
stage
in
life
there
is
only
pain
how
are
the
kids
dibdin
asked
abruptly
fine
i
exclaimed
automatically
in
an
unnatural
voice
like
a
pistol
shot
they
are
out
in
the
garden
there
and
dibdin
nodded
i
felt
certain
that
his
mind
also
was
seeing
the
analogy
to
a
funeral
and
now
my
brain
seemed
to
be
shaking
off
its
dull
lethargy
from
somewhere
in
maeterlinck
the
haunting
memory
of
a
phrase
came
glimmering
through
my
consciousness
like
a
dim
light
through
a
fog
to
the
effect
that
if
socrates
and
christ
had
been
in
the
palace
of
agamemnon
the
tragedies
of
the
house
of
atreus
could
not
have
happened
i
longed
for
a
little
wisdom
to
deal
with
the
situation
would
you
like
i
turned
to
pendleton
to
see
the
children
the
children
he
repeated
dazedly
like
to
see
them
a
moment
the
children
he
repeated
piteously
but
no
laura
sharp
sharp
was
the
stab
at
my
heart
when
he
spoke
her
name
but
either
he
is
a
supreme
master
in
deceit
or
i
am
the
dullest
of
simpletons
for
the
struggle
through
clouds
of
memory
that
his
features
expressed
seemed
real
to
me
i
told
you
she
was
dead
snapped
dibdin
gruffly
without
turning
to
him
you
told
me
ah
yes
and
he
sighed
heavily
of
course
you
told
me
and
his
chin
sank
weightily
to
his
breast
we
remained
thus
silent
for
a
space
come
i
said
standing
up
take
you
to
the
children
he
rose
ponderously
his
great
frame
limp
and
leaden
and
followed
me
somberly
he
seemed
sincere
enough
in
his
grief
i
must
own
that
dibdin
did
not
move
i
led
him
into
the
garden
toward
the
spot
where
the
children
were
huddled
about
alicia
she
was
talking
to
them
in
low
tones
and
they
were
listening
in
dead
silence
never
again
i
hope
shall
i
experience
that
sense
of
going
to
my
own
execution
that
i
experienced
at
that
instant
i
could
have
walked
to
a
gibbet
or
a
guillotine
smiling
i
am
quite
sure
what
is
my
life
to
me
i
was
walking
rather
to
the
execution
of
those
four
young
souls
under
the
gnarled
old
apple
tree
alicia
too
by
heaven
like
a
lightning
stroke
that
fact
crashed
into
my
soul
he
would
take
alicia
also
he
had
no
claim
upon
her
thank
god
not
alicia
my
voice
broke
out
from
the
turmoil
of
my
thoughts
like
the
voice
in
a
dream
breaking
the
barriers
of
sleep
eh
said
pendleton
faintly
did
you
call
uncle
ranny
alicia
turned
and
asked
in
a
clear
steady
voice
yes
alicia
i
struggled
for
control
here
is
to
see
the
children
i
meant
to
say
his
children
but
i
could
not
the
whole
evening
seemed
to
shudder
at
my
words
the
children
seemed
like
wraiths
under
the
tree
to
shudder
away
from
the
intruding
material
world
in
a
a
tragic
was
bending
toward
them
peering
peering
into
their
white
frightened
faces
then
his
gaze
settled
on
alicia
and
hung
there
for
a
space
this
must
be
randolph
he
finally
turned
to
the
eldest
boy
it
and
his
arms
stirred
forward
yes
sir
the
boy
answered
hoarsely
and
put
out
his
hand
and
this
be
baby
laura
laura
hung
her
head
then
raised
it
bravely
and
with
shy
resolution
held
out
her
hand
pendleton
took
it
and
kissed
her
clumsily
on
the
cheek
jimmie
hanging
back
clung
to
skirt
and
watched
the
proceedings
with
troubled
stealth
from
behind
her
and
this
is
jimmie
i
said
taking
the
child
by
the
the
youngest
of
them
as
pendleton
was
stooping
toward
him
jimmie
uttered
a
wild
scream
of
heartbreaking
terror
wrenched
himself
from
my
hold
and
fled
like
some
little
wounded
animal
toward
the
house
pendleton
gave
a
short
mirthless
laugh
my
throat
was
parched
my
heart
was
thumping
like
a
but
how
i
loved
jimmie
at
that
moment
he
is
only
a
baby
put
in
alicia
softly
again
pendleton
looked
at
and
this
he
murmured
alicia
palmer
i
supplied
hastily
who
has
been
looking
after
them
ah
little
deputy
and
he
held
out
his
hand
with
shamefaced
suavity
the
scene
was
incredible
enough
as
i
write
it
down
but
i
lived
a
dozen
melodramas
in
that
eternity
that
a
clock
would
tick
off
in
three
or
four
minutes
of
time
walking
about
as
i
do
under
sentence
i
am
like
a
man
of
my
acquaintance
a
stodgy
a
terrible
philistine
who
cherished
for
years
a
fancy
that
he
could
write
gilbert
and
sullivan
operas
in
all
his
life
he
had
probably
never
rhymed
anything
more
subtle
than
love
above
and
dove
since
any
fool
in
his
opinion
could
supply
the
music
he
aspired
only
to
the
gilbertian
librettos
incessantly
and
hopelessly
out
of
key
he
went
about
humming
the
sullivan
tunes
to
the
lyrics
he
alleged
to
have
in
his
mind
similarly
i
go
about
with
a
sense
of
mendacious
buoyancy
a
shipwrecked
passenger
bobbing
helplessly
in
a
troubled
sea
but
still
alive
a
flickering
glimmer
of
hope
like
a
desperate
man
facing
a
tiger
but
still
undevoured
brazenly
i
still
expect
happiness
to
emerge
somehow
out
of
hopelessness
it
is
easy
of
course
to
lapse
into
moods
of
despondency
into
wishing
i
were
dead
since
i
can
not
live
in
happiness
and
shake
the
yoke
of
inauspicious
stars
from
this
flesh
but
such
moments
pass
there
is
a
sort
of
tonic
in
the
rough
of
life
when
the
smooth
is
absent
and
the
wits
my
poor
dull
wits
brace
themselves
for
the
shock
of
action
i
feel
certain
now
that
in
all
my
years
of
tranquillity
it
is
the
salt
of
suffering
that
was
lacking
yet
who
would
seek
suffering
for
its
own
sake
i
know
however
that
i
feel
younger
and
more
energetic
than
ever
i
felt
five
years
ago
even
pendleton
has
his
uses
he
is
the
thorn
in
the
side
the
fox
gnawing
at
my
vitals
under
the
cloak
but
here
he
is
in
my
house
as
its
guest
he
goes
with
me
to
the
city
of
a
morning
on
his
quest
for
work
a
connection
as
he
calls
it
and
often
i
find
him
at
home
before
me
when
i
arrive
in
my
room
smoking
or
out
in
the
garden
with
the
children
i
wince
inwardly
but
i
hope
i
do
not
show
it
i
spoke
of
hating
him
but
that
is
untrue
you
can
not
persistently
hate
any
man
notably
a
guest
in
your
house
you
can
only
suspect
him
yet
when
i
see
the
children
still
shy
of
him
why
does
it
give
me
a
throbbing
sense
of
triumph
i
do
not
know
but
so
it
is
randolph
alone
seems
to
approach
him
nearer
as
the
days
go
by
they
go
on
walks
together
and
randolph
confides
to
alicia
that
he
is
fascinated
by
the
tales
of
his
experiences
in
the
tropics
of
ships
and
islands
and
and
native
customs
i
fancy
pendleton
must
be
selectively
on
the
alert
in
his
narratives
with
his
young
son
as
the
listener
his
past
must
contain
many
things
that
none
of
us
in
this
quiet
haven
will
ever
hear
recounted
but
i
am
indifferent
to
his
past
i
could
listen
and
even
tolerate
him
as
my
guest
if
only
the
children
were
not
passing
to
his
care
he
talks
of
relieving
me
of
the
burden
hurry
old
man
i
answer
casually
they
are
no
burden
to
me
he
gazes
at
me
and
lowers
his
eyes
i
tell
you
randolph
a
revelation
to
me
i
never
knew
a
man
like
you
before
they
make
them
like
that
these
days
praise
from
sir
hubert
occurs
to
me
but
i
say
it
i
am
in
reality
at
his
mercy
i
suppose
but
i
often
feel
as
though
he
were
at
mine
the
glossing
over
of
his
atrocious
conduct
the
taking
him
at
his
word
on
the
subject
of
his
lapsed
memory
which
we
either
slur
or
refer
to
at
all
seem
to
give
me
a
tremendous
advantage
over
him
commonplace
advantage
of
simple
honesty
over
mendacity
not
for
a
moment
do
i
now
believe
in
his
lapsed
memory
story
i
can
not
deny
however
that
his
air
is
one
of
repentance
and
as
dibdin
has
said
who
in
this
world
is
so
hard
but
he
give
a
fellow
man
a
second
chance
jim
pendleton
now
that
he
has
been
to
a
new
york
appears
as
impressive
and
debonair
as
ever
he
must
be
in
the
middle
forties
and
he
is
not
it
is
chiefly
his
eyes
that
seem
changed
to
me
do
what
i
will
i
can
not
look
at
them
there
is
a
certain
disturbing
obliqueness
about
his
gaze
that
makes
me
turn
mine
away
in
a
sort
of
vicarious
shame
but
again
un
mauvais
metier
que
celui
de
and
conscious
of
that
truth
i
mean
to
speak
or
think
no
more
ill
of
jim
pendleton
after
all
his
large
contact
with
the
world
has
given
him
something
that
i
lack
last
evening
at
dinner
he
was
regaling
us
with
an
experience
of
his
of
spearing
fish
in
the
marquesas
i
was
in
the
back
of
the
boat
he
was
saying
with
a
torch
in
my
hand
and
my
islander
who
was
an
expert
at
it
held
his
spear
ready
for
the
first
fish
that
leaped
several
of
them
leaped
and
fell
again
into
the
water
round
us
churning
it
up
so
that
we
were
wet
with
spray
suddenly
i
saw
a
huge
mass
glistening
in
the
torchlight
falling
it
seemed
right
on
top
of
us
the
native
buried
his
spear
upward
in
the
thing
as
it
fell
i
tell
you
that
man
was
quick
but
it
was
too
late
the
huge
fish
flopped
into
the
boat
with
its
great
head
on
my
knees
and
the
full
weight
of
his
body
on
the
man
sending
him
overboard
and
splintering
the
side
of
the
boat
in
just
about
a
second
we
were
in
total
darkness
floundering
in
the
water
with
an
overturned
boat
i
was
badly
bruised
and
the
native
had
both
legs
broken
in
spite
of
his
broken
legs
however
he
offered
to
swim
ashore
to
the
nearest
projecting
rock
but
i
was
sure
he
make
it
and
very
certain
i
it
was
a
job
i
can
tell
you
righting
that
boat
helping
that
man
into
it
and
scrambling
in
myself
and
then
with
a
piece
of
splintered
oar
rowing
ourselves
in
the
fellow
with
his
broken
legs
worked
just
as
hard
as
i
did
and
never
uttered
so
much
as
a
groan
it
did
me
up
for
some
time
but
that
fellow
was
spearing
fish
again
in
ten
days
or
so
jimmie
who
is
sometimes
allowed
to
take
his
supper
with
us
sat
gazing
at
his
father
fascinated
by
the
narrative
until
the
last
word
then
seemingly
jealous
that
any
one
even
this
strange
father
should
exceed
me
in
prowess
his
little
face
clouded
and
he
demanded
uncle
ranny
you
ever
spear
a
big
fish
no
jimmie
i
laughed
but
maybe
you
and
i
will
go
there
one
day
and
spear
some
together
well
anyway
he
retorted
stoutly
you
took
us
on
a
picnic
whereat
we
all
laughed
albeit
my
own
laugh
was
rueful
the
thought
flashed
through
my
mind
that
pendleton
was
certain
to
win
them
to
himself
the
moment
he
decided
to
do
so
the
very
memory
of
me
would
become
ridiculous
to
them
uncle
ranny
spoke
up
laura
has
been
too
busy
feeding
us
and
buying
us
clothes
to
go
traveling
alicia
smiled
radiantly
at
laura
across
the
table
and
griselda
who
had
just
come
in
with
the
dessert
nodded
her
head
with
somber
emphasis
as
she
placed
the
bowl
before
me
i
could
have
hugged
them
all
three
in
gratitude
but
nevertheless
i
pressed
pendleton
to
narrate
more
of
his
experiences
no
he
shook
his
head
evidently
taking
the
comment
to
heart
yarn
enough
for
one
evening
that
seemed
to
me
very
decent
of
pendleton
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
dibdin
i
called
him
up
on
the
telephone
and
demanded
what
he
meant
by
coming
from
devil
knows
where
after
more
than
two
absence
and
virtually
cutting
me
come
to
lunch
at
the
salmagundi
club
he
growled
does
it
pain
you
as
much
as
that
to
ask
me
be
a
damn
fool
he
retorted
be
so
wickedly
witty
i
replied
at
he
muttered
and
hung
up
the
receiver
from
which
i
gathered
that
he
was
out
of
sorts
in
the
hall
of
the
club
where
he
was
waiting
i
greeted
him
with
it
weakness
of
intellect
birdie
i
cried
a
rather
tough
worm
in
your
little
inside
he
stared
at
me
how
you
can
be
so
light
and
idiotic
in
the
face
of
circumstances
he
began
passes
my
comprehension
circumstances
my
dear
fellow
are
all
there
is
to
life
want
to
wash
your
paws
am
as
clean
as
i
shall
ever
be
i
put
my
arm
through
his
and
allowed
him
to
lead
me
to
a
quiet
table
in
the
rear
of
the
billiard
room
softly
illumined
by
a
shaded
lamp
at
midday
what
a
delightful
place
i
exclaimed
residence
of
tranquillity
tranquillity
be
blowed
he
grunted
as
he
sat
down
facing
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
that
old
man
of
the
sea
of
yours
you
mean
pendleton
whom
the
devil
else
can
i
mean
why
nothing
of
course
but
give
him
a
leg
up
if
we
can
what
else
is
there
to
do
i
just
received
a
letter
this
morning
from
an
insurance
company
asking
for
confidential
information
about
him
given
me
as
a
reference
and
evidently
considering
him
the
danbury
and
phoenix
he
asked
yes
how
did
you
know
i
got
one
too
i
suppose
we
are
really
his
only
two
possible
sponsors
at
present
as
soon
recommend
a
convict
from
sing
sing
he
muttered
oh
no
i
protested
not
as
bad
as
that
besides
sometimes
you
have
to
recommend
even
a
convict
much
rather
recommend
a
convict
i
hate
to
lie
about
this
man
been
asked
whether
i
would
trust
him
and
i
have
to
say
yes
but
you
know
dashed
well
i
give
me
a
cigarette
he
ended
savagely
i
think
go
straight
now
i
murmured
dully
passing
my
case
to
dibdin
and
looking
away
the
children
will
no
doubt
have
an
influence
on
him
you
judge
everybody
by
yourself
how
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
he
declared
putting
both
elbows
on
the
table
i
had
no
idea
what
the
children
would
do
to
you
what
did
they
do
to
me
i
queried
mystified
made
you
all
explain
i
said
gazing
at
him
stupidly
what
is
there
to
explain
growled
dibdin
when
the
waiter
was
out
of
earshot
you
were
always
a
decent
sort
of
muddler
dilettante
whatever
it
of
real
life
fit
only
to
collect
pretty
little
books
or
old
musty
volumes
that
nobody
really
cares
to
read
drifter
with
about
as
much
knowledge
of
the
problems
of
existence
as
a
stuffed
owl
in
a
glass
what
happened
your
orphans
come
to
you
you
plunge
into
life
go
into
business
which
you
detest
lose
your
money
go
to
work
as
a
clerk
by
george
you
of
all
people
a
roof
over
them
bring
them
up
and
hang
me
if
i
think
you
were
idiotically
happy
in
it
all
until
i
brought
this
old
man
of
the
sea
right
had
i
to
pick
him
up
and
bring
him
and
bungle
it
all
and
why
the
hell
you
warn
me
not
to
fetch
him
i
thought
i
was
helping
you
out
sooner
have
chucked
the
brute
would
by
heaven
for
a
moment
i
could
reply
nothing
at
all
to
dibdin
his
estimate
and
account
of
my
actions
were
natural
enough
to
him
who
despite
his
burly
manner
exaggerates
qualities
it
seemed
the
more
remarkable
that
he
who
so
firmly
believed
in
the
second
chance
should
now
find
no
word
to
say
in
favor
but
i
could
see
clearly
enough
that
what
troubled
him
was
the
pain
he
instinctively
realized
the
departure
of
the
children
from
me
to
pendleton
was
certain
to
bring
me
why
you
cable
me
the
brute
he
took
up
his
argument
because
my
dear
fellow
i
put
my
hand
on
his
arm
across
the
table
it
was
too
late
once
you
had
found
him
and
told
him
of
what
had
occurred
in
his
absence
it
was
too
late
would
you
like
to
live
with
the
menacing
uncertainty
of
him
overhanging
in
space
rather
have
him
here
and
face
him
besides
the
children
are
his
knew
i
must
state
my
view
squarely
on
that
if
he
is
fit
to
take
them
then
have
them
he
must
regardless
regardless
of
you
you
mean
he
put
it
darkly
of
me
certainly
i
count
by
the
lord
and
his
fine
head
shot
upwards
in
a
gesture
that
was
in
itself
invigorating
know
you
are
twenty
times
the
man
you
were
he
cried
i
have
believed
it
stupendous
i
laughed
and
waved
him
away
with
a
going
it
blind
like
that
he
ran
on
disregarding
me
salmon
and
byrd
with
a
losing
all
your
money
and
for
the
it
gad
you
are
living
life
i
call
take
off
my
hat
to
you
put
it
on
again
i
murmured
moved
by
his
vehemence
it
was
certainly
agreeable
to
hear
such
words
from
dibdin
who
never
lied
praise
is
a
savory
dish
not
a
thing
that
my
misspent
life
has
been
surfeited
with
and
it
was
exquisitely
soothing
to
vanity
but
it
was
clear
enough
that
dibdin
was
wrong
his
usually
lucid
view
was
obscured
by
the
tangle
of
circumstances
that
weighed
upon
him
naturally
i
could
not
leave
him
in
his
error
if
you
knew
i
managed
to
stammer
the
malignant
fear
that
is
eating
my
liver
white
fear
of
what
he
broke
in
of
turning
those
kids
over
to
him
i
lowered
my
just
that
else
just
that
he
repeated
gloomily
nodding
his
head
who
would
have
supposed
it
by
the
lord
if
ever
there
was
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
i
am
that
bull
why
the
devil
did
i
ever
pick
the
brute
up
look
here
he
flashed
with
sudden
inspiration
why
not
deport
him
as
we
imported
him
eh
i
might
manage
might
you
nor
i
would
do
such
a
thing
why
not
he
growled
that
would
make
than
he
is
or
was
i
explained
sadly
for
i
must
own
that
for
an
instant
my
heart
leaped
at
his
suggestion
besides
i
went
on
prosily
not
so
easy
to
lay
a
ghost
when
once
raised
it
got
to
believe
him
dibdin
my
only
for
the
young
sake
he
will
probably
get
his
job
and
the
thing
to
do
now
is
not
to
arouse
his
suspicion
of
how
we
feel
about
him
believe
everything
he
in
him
thousands
every
year
according
to
the
newspapers
turn
up
willfully
missing
he
was
tired
of
the
humdrum
life
and
lit
out
that
is
all
there
was
to
it
now
he
wants
to
try
back
you
yourself
thought
he
ought
to
have
another
chance
there
was
genuine
pathos
in
old
voice
when
he
spoke
out
with
a
humid
somber
look
by
george
that
the
nemesis
of
us
all
by
his
one
willful
act
of
destructive
irresponsibility
he
has
affected
all
our
lives
destructively
maddening
that
one
worthless
brute
should
be
able
to
do
all
that
he
killed
laura
damn
him
he
orphaned
these
kids
upset
your
makes
wretched
conspirators
of
you
and
like
to
pound
him
to
a
jelly
i
laughed
joylessly
what
would
that
undo
nothing
i
dare
say
snapped
dibdin
besides
you
really
have
no
complaint
boy
you
tower
randolph
my
lad
yes
by
george
you
tower
head
and
shoulders
above
any
one
i
know
his
very
villainy
has
made
you
the
breath
of
life
into
you
i
believe
i
answered
something
flippant
look
here
he
cried
with
a
sudden
movement
upsetting
a
glass
of
water
and
disregarding
it
if
those
kids
go
over
to
him
we
can
keep
an
eye
on
the
though
we
were
with
them
how
mean
i
queried
puzzled
that
her
keep
an
eye
on
them
sharp
i
tell
you
with
her
innocent
blue
eyes
give
you
a
daily
report
no
i
emphatically
interrupted
him
that
never
she
is
not
going
from
my
not
to
him
i
was
the
more
abashed
by
my
own
vehemence
when
i
saw
dibdin
staring
at
me
with
lifted
eyebrows
are
he
began
i
interrupted
him
hotly
i
am
nothing
is
to
me
just
as
jimmie
and
laura
and
randolph
are
but
they
are
unfortunately
his
you
know
the
meaning
of
responsibility
for
young
lives
dibdin
i
want
to
give
her
her
chance
educate
her
make
a
fine
woman
of
her
they
have
a
father
she
has
no
one
but
me
i
turn
her
i
wish
i
added
lamely
i
had
as
much
right
to
keep
them
all
whew
he
whistled
in
renewed
astonishment
i
can
only
say
i
know
you
any
more
i
used
to
know
you
but
proud
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
new
randolph
byrd
be
a
damn
fool
dibdin
i
mumbled
in
exasperation
you
know
you
are
talking
rot
why
the
devil
are
you
so
interested
in
the
kids
there
is
that
cheque
you
you
cashed
it
he
interposed
moving
his
shoulders
as
one
shaking
off
something
why
the
deuce
you
i
will
some
day
i
grinned
at
him
feebly
when
i
need
it
more
but
you
answered
my
question
i
felt
i
was
goading
him
brutally
but
for
once
i
seemed
to
have
the
dear
old
tramp
upon
the
hip
for
all
his
gruffness
he
was
as
full
of
emotions
as
anybody
it
seemed
to
me
absurd
for
a
man
to
hide
his
implanted
instinct
one
of
the
noblest
of
all
the
little
hidden
of
our
instincts
under
a
false
shame
or
indifference
women
are
hide
theirs
and
i
had
become
shameless
about
mine
why
i
repeated
are
you
so
much
interested
in
those
kids
be
an
ass
he
grunted
looking
down
upon
the
wet
tablecloth
and
a
spasm
as
of
pain
crossed
his
countenance
ah
you
see
i
laughed
attempting
to
lighten
his
mood
randolph
he
uttered
in
a
strange
solemn
tone
that
sent
a
slight
thrill
through
me
i
told
you
once
there
was
a
woman
i
had
cared
only
one
you
never
married
her
no
he
continued
in
the
etiolated
tone
of
a
dead
grief
she
was
married
already
when
i
knew
her
and
then
my
sympathy
went
out
to
grizzled
old
dibdin
i
am
sorry
i
murmured
touching
his
hand
across
the
table
did
i
know
her
yes
he
said
quietly
you
knew
her
it
was
laura
in
a
flash
of
poignantly
bitter
and
vain
regret
i
saw
the
vista
of
the
dead
what
might
have
been
are
common
as
blackberries
pendleton
is
once
again
a
faithful
worker
in
the
vineyard
of
the
insurance
company
a
commonplace
miracle
enough
but
all
miracles
i
suppose
are
commonplaces
that
happen
to
surprise
us
or
that
we
understand
the
abstract
office
i
am
sure
has
more
joy
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
than
over
ninety
and
i
do
not
wish
to
be
blasphemous
like
death
it
claims
us
all
in
the
end
a
voluptuary
an
idler
like
myself
or
a
renegade
who
broke
from
it
indefensibly
like
jim
sooner
or
or
return
to
its
yoke
like
starved
runaway
unrelenting
office
what
a
change
it
must
be
to
jim
after
the
beaches
and
the
barrooms
of
the
gorgeous
east
but
for
one
closely
relevant
circumstance
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
sorry
for
him
what
a
strange
and
wonderful
institution
is
the
family
another
of
those
commonplace
miracles
so
charged
with
mystery
like
birth
and
death
if
i
were
a
classical
writer
or
a
sir
barnes
newcome
i
might
expatiate
at
length
upon
the
subject
the
things
we
swallow
and
condone
and
cover
up
for
the
sake
of
its
ties
suffice
it
however
that
jim
pendleton
is
quietly
working
out
his
salvation
a
salary
and
plans
for
his
dismembered
home
the
children
are
becoming
quite
used
to
him
randolph
seems
to
be
the
nearest
to
him
and
jimmie
remains
stubbornly
farthest
away
it
is
painful
to
think
however
that
youth
will
the
more
certainly
and
completely
detach
him
from
me
in
the
end
when
is
it
all
to
happen
i
for
one
dare
not
fix
the
fateful
day
which
with
every
passing
hour
draws
nearer
no
one
fixes
the
day
it
is
left
dangling
in
the
air
by
an
invisible
thread
of
uncertain
length
and
there
are
times
when
i
could
cry
out
in
my
anguish
my
agony
of
nameless
pain
fear
apprehension
but
what
a
spectacle
i
should
make
of
myself
if
i
gave
vent
to
emotion
we
humans
are
not
so
much
whited
sepulchers
as
masked
and
silent
volcanoes
and
jim
is
he
thinking
feeling
he
is
suave
quiet
controlled
he
is
very
gentle
with
them
all
and
particularly
with
alicia
he
has
taken
to
consulting
and
confabulating
with
her
touching
the
characteristics
and
the
needs
of
the
children
at
times
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
not
bear
it
and
once
at
least
i
have
called
her
and
spoken
harshly
to
her
and
charged
her
with
having
mislaid
a
volume
of
prices
how
childish
on
my
part
but
my
nerves
are
not
what
once
they
were
they
are
tetchy
and
fractious
it
has
been
decreed
that
i
am
to
have
a
vacation
and
go
away
for
a
to
maine
or
new
hampshire
if
i
were
to
burst
into
laughter
at
the
thought
i
might
end
like
an
hysterical
woman
in
uncontrollable
tears
i
could
no
more
go
now
than
i
could
spread
my
arms
and
fly
i
am
as
remote
from
the
holiday
spirit
as
from
the
north
star
poor
mistaken
he
is
in
me
he
blathers
of
my
towering
head
and
shoulders
it
makes
me
shudder
with
shame
what
a
weakling
i
am
in
the
face
of
life
am
a
toiler
in
bleecker
street
of
its
reeking
pavements
its
purlieus
where
the
italian
children
grub
and
shout
and
sun
themselves
in
the
gutters
in
the
air
of
a
thousand
smells
throbbing
under
the
noonday
sun
the
homecoming
to
the
suburb
used
to
be
refreshing
and
soothing
like
a
delicate
perfume
to
see
the
children
laughing
and
rosy
in
the
square
inch
of
garden
to
see
alicia
sparkling
with
her
young
energy
and
enthusiasm
had
all
been
like
coming
into
a
cool
temple
filled
with
shapes
of
beauty
after
wandering
in
some
fetid
bazaar
now
it
is
dust
and
ashes
i
could
never
convey
to
dibdin
or
to
any
one
else
how
alone
i
feel
in
the
world
what
chill
and
cutting
blasts
of
desolation
sweep
into
my
life
every
time
i
think
of
its
present
or
its
future
minot
blackden
came
in
to
at
noon
to
drag
me
out
to
lunch
stop
in
at
my
studio
for
a
minute
he
proposed
as
he
steered
me
round
a
corner
something
for
you
to
see
he
showed
me
a
small
rose
window
designed
for
some
church
in
cincinnati
and
turned
expectantly
to
catch
my
exclamations
i
gasped
out
some
inanities
art
my
boy
he
gloated
art
for
you
it
is
indeed
i
assented
helplessly
only
surprising
thing
is
how
a
real
artist
can
acquire
so
much
fame
seems
to
me
i
see
something
about
you
in
every
sunday
newspaper
i
take
up
ah
business
instinct
he
chuckled
i
am
no
amateur
i
can
tell
you
i
live
this
thing
you
may
think
it
insane
but
sometimes
i
think
i
am
benvenuto
cellini
reincarnated
he
was
not
laughing
he
was
in
deadly
earnest
come
in
he
added
solemnly
directing
me
to
a
door
in
the
rear
of
his
shop
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
my
press
agent
i
was
duly
introduced
to
a
plain
bustling
smith
of
perhaps
who
rose
from
a
typewriter
and
spoke
with
a
devotional
a
reverential
fervor
of
our
work
while
casting
worshipful
glances
at
the
artist
how
do
the
minot
blackdens
inspire
such
adoration
i
know
i
have
rediscovered
no
lost
art
and
it
is
plain
i
am
no
incarnation
of
benvenuto
cellini
no
one
will
ever
worship
me
have
you
seen
miss
bayard
lately
blackden
inquired
as
we
sat
down
to
an
italian
luncheon
beginning
with
sardines
and
red
pepper
i
answered
surprised
do
you
know
her
do
i
know
her
you
remember
introducing
us
in
front
of
i
had
forgotten
it
and
it
seemed
to
hurt
him
that
i
did
not
regard
his
movements
and
events
with
the
devotional
attention
of
his
press
agent
of
course
i
murmured
lamely
seen
her
again
he
smiled
a
detached
superior
smile
such
as
the
immortals
might
smile
over
erring
unregenerate
humans
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
dark
artistic
hair
i
see
her
quite
often
he
explained
very
wonderful
woman
miss
bayard
she
is
a
great
inspiration
to
me
in
my
art
my
art
has
taken
strides
and
leaps
since
i
met
her
surprised
you
seize
the
opportunity
of
seeing
her
truly
artistic
nature
ass
i
thought
but
aloud
i
explained
that
domestic
preoccupations
left
me
little
time
for
social
or
any
other
visits
the
casualness
of
my
answer
seemed
to
brighten
blackden
perceptibly
i
recalled
incidentally
that
i
had
promised
gertrude
though
heaven
knows
why
to
let
her
know
the
upshot
of
return
tell
her
when
you
see
her
that
i
am
coming
very
soon
had
a
good
deal
on
my
hands
she
will
understand
she
understands
everything
murmured
blackden
absently
ah
there
is
a
woman
yes
tell
her
and
his
eyes
glowed
in
anticipation
he
was
positively
affectionate
to
me
this
austere
artist
when
he
left
me
at
door
to
come
home
as
i
have
said
used
to
be
a
delight
the
presence
of
one
person
in
it
has
changed
it
to
a
torment
this
evening
when
i
approached
my
châlet
on
the
rock
i
found
pendleton
in
high
good
humor
playing
a
game
with
the
children
on
the
lawn
a
flap
of
canvas
making
a
sort
of
pup
tent
had
been
fastened
to
the
tree
for
jimmie
to
give
him
that
touch
of
savage
life
which
even
at
crestlands
little
boys
seem
to
crave
savage
life
at
crestlands
yet
once
the
mohicans
roamed
here
and
the
mohican
that
is
in
all
of
us
craves
an
outlet
in
jimmie
it
craved
an
outlet
in
me
when
i
saw
the
great
hulk
of
pendleton
squatting
in
the
tent
entrance
enacting
the
rôle
of
cannibal
chief
i
stood
unobserved
for
a
moment
watching
the
scene
with
bitterness
in
my
heart
and
shame
on
top
of
the
bitterness
bring
the
prisoner
before
me
grunted
pendleton
in
the
character
of
the
chief
tittering
in
suppressed
glee
randolph
and
laura
marched
jimmie
up
to
pendleton
who
measured
the
child
with
a
fearful
frown
and
demanded
where
were
the
other
prisoners
they
escaped
your
majesty
exploded
randolph
with
stifled
laughter
this
white
man
alone
dared
to
remain
and
brave
your
power
he
should
be
boiled
and
eaten
by
rights
pendleton
growled
truculently
he
dares
to
face
the
big
chief
of
the
cannibal
islands
because
of
his
great
courage
however
he
added
as
an
afterthought
we
shall
spare
his
life
of
such
stuff
great
warriors
are
made
beware
your
majesty
giggled
laura
he
might
treacherously
plan
some
harm
to
you
he
is
very
brave
this
white
chief
we
see
he
is
a
desperate
blade
answered
pendleton
judicially
but
we
admire
bravery
he
shall
be
our
in
battle
no
i
want
to
be
eaten
shrilled
jimmie
in
his
excitement
whereat
the
others
shrieked
and
shook
with
laughter
alicia
alone
seemed
moderate
in
her
merriment
i
hugged
it
to
my
heart
that
she
appeared
to
look
a
shade
sadly
upon
the
scene
but
i
am
probably
wrong
i
went
indoors
and
sank
my
chin
upon
my
hands
with
a
turmoil
of
emotions
which
i
wish
to
forget
pendleton
is
winning
them
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
not
a
soul
who
would
cling
to
me
excepting
possibly
griselda
shakespeare
never
uttered
anything
truer
than
that
life
was
a
tale
told
by
an
idiot
full
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
i
wish
i
had
never
been
born
this
morning
i
longed
to
romp
and
riot
with
the
children
to
shake
off
every
atom
of
care
to
laugh
and
roll
on
the
floor
with
them
to
be
happy
as
i
have
been
happy
but
i
could
not
held
in
the
grip
of
a
heartache
that
permeated
every
fiber
in
my
body
i
slunk
sullenly
away
to
my
study
after
dinner
to
be
alone
but
even
that
i
could
not
have
pendleton
followed
on
my
heels
lit
a
cigar
and
inquired
whether
he
could
have
a
talk
with
me
naturally
i
could
not
prevent
it
i
can
prevent
nothing
for
i
am
no
longer
master
in
my
own
house
old
man
he
began
in
his
suave
thick
voice
which
he
means
to
be
friendly
which
to
me
seems
orgulous
with
triumph
seems
to
me
about
due
for
a
rest
what
mean
i
faltered
wincing
though
inwardly
i
knew
well
enough
what
he
meant
just
what
i
say
he
smiled
you
have
worked
hard
my
family
time
i
took
the
load
off
your
what
i
mean
i
waved
my
hand
in
a
gesture
of
deprecation
but
i
could
not
speak
oh
i
know
he
insisted
doggedly
though
even
now
he
can
not
look
me
in
the
eyes
you
do
it
specially
for
me
you
did
it
because
you
are
a
they
make
like
you
as
told
you
but
you
want
praise
from
me
i
know
that
you
need
it
more
to
the
point
is
time
i
took
a
flat
or
small
house
in
one
of
the
suburbs
and
had
the
lot
of
them
move
over
and
live
on
me
for
a
while
about
time
he
nodded
his
head
and
shifted
his
cigar
about
time
every
word
was
a
stab
but
i
steeled
myself
for
the
ordeal
that
what
i
had
been
expecting
all
this
time
you
want
to
make
the
change
i
endeavored
to
speak
crisply
as
when
i
address
the
national
city
or
the
guaranty
trust
over
the
telephone
at
well
i
thought
begin
to
look
round
be
the
place
to
find
some
furniture
to
installment
plan
will
job
ought
to
be
fixed
up
in
two
or
three
weeks
i
guess
he
added
with
a
laugh
uncle
ranny
will
have
to
come
to
supper
pretty
often
to
keep
the
kids
as
happy
as
like
to
see
them
eh
but
a
going
i
spoke
quickly
in
a
sort
of
last
spasm
of
pitiful
quite
undertaking
to
set
going
know
he
nodded
soberly
think
i
know
have
to
push
the
wheel
both
shoulders
but
know
he
lifted
a
confidential
eyebrow
that
young
be
a
great
help
to
a
little
housekeeper
she
a
hope
laura
will
take
after
her
my
heart
was
of
lead
if
he
was
watching
my
face
he
must
have
perceived
a
deadly
pallor
sweeping
every
drop
of
blood
away
from
it
there
was
a
pounding
in
my
like
rushing
waters
alicia
i
heard
myself
saying
as
one
speaking
after
being
rescued
from
drowning
alicia
you
know
my
yours
i
send
her
to
you
are
anyway
her
wishes
are
a
factor
in
the
matter
do
anything
old
man
my
head
seemed
to
swell
suddenly
and
shoot
upwards
like
a
cork
from
an
abyss
and
my
face
was
damp
with
anything
but
i
send
that
child
to
you
she
is
see
that
you
oh
yes
i
he
was
looking
away
as
he
spoke
i
have
a
lingering
hope
he
had
not
been
watching
my
face
all
true
of
course
but
put
yourself
in
my
place
randolph
here
are
three
motherless
children
she
that
girl
has
been
a
kind
of
mother
to
them
seems
to
have
a
born
faculty
for
it
what
would
i
do
without
her
just
starting
in
like
understand
surely
surely
i
hastened
to
assure
him
because
i
felt
slightly
more
master
of
myself
but
you
see
my
belong
to
me
and
even
if
she
just
pass
her
a
i
mean
is
i
coerce
her
in
any
way
and
suddenly
i
saw
the
children
away
from
me
with
this
dubious
mysterious
man
alone
and
my
heart
was
wrung
with
agony
with
alicia
at
no
i
could
not
acquiesce
so
completely
not
was
his
wholly
reasonable
comment
i
reckon
a
word
from
you
would
go
a
long
way
though
but
i
see
your
point
randolph
i
see
your
point
tell
you
what
he
began
in
a
new
tone
suppose
we
put
it
this
way
speak
to
her
put
it
up
to
you
out
of
it
altogether
see
it
to
her
to
you
have
be
neutral
you
see
the
matter
with
doing
it
that
way
a
thousand
devils
within
me
moved
me
with
all
but
irresistible
force
to
jump
at
his
throat
to
stifle
his
words
to
choke
the
beastly
life
out
of
him
to
end
the
torment
then
and
there
but
i
could
could
not
i
knew
he
was
expressing
by
his
words
his
sense
of
certainty
that
he
could
win
over
alicia
as
he
had
won
the
i
was
helpless
in
his
i
was
a
weakling
whom
he
was
making
the
barest
pretense
of
he
could
strip
my
household
of
all
i
held
dear
with
an
ease
so
laughable
that
he
could
not
even
bother
to
ridicule
me
and
yet
i
could
not
rise
up
and
strangle
him
as
one
in
a
vise
i
sat
for
a
moment
chained
by
wild
conflicting
passions
and
strange
thing
happened
a
feeling
of
nakedness
a
sense
of
being
stripped
of
everything
like
another
job
of
being
utterly
alone
in
the
world
fell
about
me
like
an
atmosphere
i
felt
deprived
of
everything
though
not
bereft
it
was
an
odd
feeling
a
sort
of
involuntary
renunciation
of
all
that
was
my
life
in
which
yet
i
calmly
acquiesced
i
faced
and
addressed
pendleton
almost
with
tranquillity
certainly
i
experienced
a
strange
new
dignity
that
was
very
soothing
very
grateful
as
water
to
the
thirsty
after
battle
very
well
jim
i
heard
myself
saying
quietly
go
ahead
your
own
way
that
perhaps
is
best
all
that
i
remember
is
a
gleam
of
triumph
in
his
eye
no
word
of
all
his
chunnering
and
maundering
afterwards
do
i
recall
he
talked
on
smoking
for
perhaps
four
or
five
minutes
and
then
he
left
me
by
myself
i
felt
at
once
strangely
heavy
as
a
mountain
and
insubstantial
as
the
shadow
thereof
again
and
again
i
have
been
told
that
i
am
a
fool
but
not
even
my
dearest
friends
have
called
me
mad
are
the
gods
then
really
so
anxious
to
destroy
me
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
it
this
morning
after
last
interview
with
pendleton
i
saw
saw
her
as
it
seemed
for
the
first
time
and
yet
an
overwhelming
realization
flooded
me
like
a
tidal
wave
that
through
countless
ages
she
and
she
alone
had
been
inexpressibly
dear
to
me
she
the
divine
ideal
i
had
been
pursuing
catching
fitful
glimpses
of
in
glades
and
forests
on
mountain
tops
in
palaces
in
fantastic
surroundings
amid
incredible
scenes
of
a
dim
and
ancient
more
real
than
any
was
alicia
this
child
alicia
and
i
am
more
than
twice
her
age
nothing
can
come
of
it
but
misery
and
wretchedness
for
me
by
no
word
or
sign
dare
i
convey
such
a
thing
to
her
or
to
any
one
no
one
except
these
pale
pages
that
receive
my
poor
motley
confidences
with
the
only
discretion
i
can
trust
she
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
worlds
yet
not
only
must
i
remain
dumb
but
i
must
guard
my
every
word
gesture
thought
even
as
never
before
in
the
midst
of
all
else
this
is
a
catastrophe
yet
it
overshadows
and
overbalances
everything
let
me
disclose
the
truth
by
so
much
as
a
sign
and
every
act
and
motive
of
mine
becomes
abruptly
suspect
and
i
shall
stand
revealed
for
the
immoral
shameful
creature
that
i
suppose
i
am
i
could
face
that
i
believe
if
there
were
any
there
i
must
hide
and
cover
and
conquer
the
feeling
by
inanition
but
how
can
i
when
she
is
so
untellably
dear
and
precious
to
me
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
can
not
let
pendleton
try
to
inveigle
her
to
leave
me
no
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
betray
this
garish
resolution
and
my
secret
will
be
out
and
all
that
i
am
and
have
done
will
stand
forth
as
naked
pretense
and
i
shall
appear
stripped
and
manacled
like
a
common
criminal
too
good
for
the
hangman
and
i
have
dared
to
judge
pendleton
the
remedy
in
fiction
when
a
man
finds
himself
in
love
with
any
one
he
has
no
business
to
love
is
i
believe
to
go
away
to
travel
how
ridiculous
that
sounds
to
me
the
only
place
i
can
go
to
is
to
and
now
i
have
come
back
from
and
i
can
not
stay
in
the
house
i
can
not
stay
in
the
house
because
alicia
is
in
pendleton
oh
he
will
have
his
way
i
am
sure
the
old
man
of
the
sea
infallibly
has
why
should
the
unscrupulous
always
have
the
advantage
i
abhor
to
think
of
him
it
is
alicia
that
is
filling
my
mind
my
heart
my
life
i
have
been
trying
to
think
of
her
even
until
yesterday
as
a
child
and
i
know
i
have
been
deceitful
she
is
a
is
womanhood
i
see
her
now
in
her
radiance
and
every
movement
and
gesture
of
her
every
act
every
glance
speaks
of
the
freshness
and
youth
of
life
of
a
supreme
a
divine
beauty
i
have
called
her
a
child
and
i
yearn
to
sink
at
her
knees
and
cry
out
my
anguish
and
my
adoration
i
am
the
child
helpless
before
her
whatever
i
conceal
i
can
not
conceal
what
her
going
would
do
to
me
it
would
shatter
what
remains
of
my
life
and
i
suffered
pendleton
yesterday
to
propose
calmly
that
she
go
over
to
in
alicia
with
pendleton
it
is
stifling
to
think
of
i
must
go
out
but
i
can
not
let
any
of
them
see
me
i
feel
like
a
thief
in
my
own
house
the
i
can
slip
out
for
at
least
a
solitary
hour
under
the
stars
i
did
not
manage
to
get
out
under
the
stars
after
all
just
as
i
began
to
fumble
with
the
screen
alicia
asked
leave
to
come
in
no
presence
could
have
been
more
welcome
to
me
but
the
dark
thoughts
under
which
i
had
been
brooding
made
me
wince
with
pain
as
she
entered
nevertheless
i
contrived
to
greet
her
with
almost
normal
cheerfulness
uncle
ranny
she
began
hurriedly
in
an
undertone
coming
close
to
me
is
it
really
coming
then
what
do
you
mean
my
dear
i
asked
her
though
such
subterfuges
are
quite
useless
with
alicia
oh
just
been
telling
me
that
he
has
his
eye
on
a
flat
near
columbia
university
in
new
he
expects
to
have
it
going
by
the
time
the
schools
he
told
you
what
else
did
he
say
i
queried
breathlessly
nothing
he
asked
me
whether
i
think
it
was
wise
to
get
settled
there
as
soon
as
possible
he
is
very
nice
to
me
is
that
all
i
breathed
yes
about
that
enough
i
smiled
feebly
and
sank
into
my
chair
with
immense
relief
i
longed
to
draw
her
to
me
to
enfold
her
to
rest
her
head
against
my
heart
to
hold
her
close
and
to
exclude
thereby
all
black
care
and
worry
all
overhanging
shadows
all
the
threatening
and
looming
clouds
of
make
my
world
blissfully
complete
but
i
am
only
uncle
ranny
to
i
felt
a
shudder
pass
down
my
spine
and
you
alicia
i
managed
to
say
what
did
you
answer
of
course
i
said
that
was
could
i
say
but
oh
uncle
ranny
she
leaned
toward
me
as
she
stood
at
my
desk
i
am
afraid
uncle
ranny
they
are
know
their
father
but
i
help
feeling
as
though
we
them
over
to
a
i
suppose
i
ought
not
say
one
we
know
at
all
and
she
burst
into
tears
blood
and
flesh
could
not
bear
it
longer
i
twitched
and
writhed
in
my
chair
for
an
instant
then
i
leaped
up
and
threw
my
arms
about
her
and
strained
her
to
me
my
darling
i
murmured
brokenly
and
how
do
you
suppose
i
feel
i
know
she
sobbed
and
gently
very
much
as
jimmie
or
laura
might
have
done
she
put
her
arms
about
me
and
nestled
as
though
i
were
some
one
old
and
fragile
for
whom
she
had
a
deep
that
was
all
first
embrace
and
then
i
knew
also
she
did
not
i
trust
for
an
instant
suspect
the
bitterness
of
the
cup
i
was
that
moment
draining
but
why
should
i
expect
anything
else
the
guilt
in
my
own
heart
tells
me
enough
too
exactly
where
i
stand
alicia
is
still
a
child
as
yet
evidently
she
did
not
even
suspect
that
pendleton
was
bent
upon
taking
her
also
suppose
i
prevented
that
then
what
of
the
other
three
whom
in
another
way
i
love
no
less
my
head
was
throbbing
dizzily
my
pulses
were
beating
like
drums
for
me
this
was
the
supreme
moment
of
anguish
and
sacrifice
the
dark
night
of
the
soul
that
that
john
of
the
cross
knows
so
well
how
to
describe
that
shakes
being
and
changes
life
forever
more
my
lot
seemed
to
be
to
sacrifice
and
break
myself
in
final
and
complete
renunciation
to
drain
my
cup
of
bitterness
to
its
uttermost
dregs
for
a
moment
the
world
was
as
a
shadow
swaying
airy
and
insubstantial
the
cowled
monk
that
is
buried
somewhere
within
me
was
suddenly
uppermost
and
the
life
of
the
world
seemed
sordid
and
leprous
a
deadly
thing
rotted
with
lusts
and
passions
a
thing
to
run
away
was
pulling
me
into
its
sensual
center
but
only
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
the
blood
surged
to
my
temples
as
alicia
lay
in
my
arms
and
the
ancient
cunning
of
a
thousand
male
ancestors
of
savage
hunters
and
crafty
warriors
who
died
that
i
might
live
swept
into
my
thews
and
nerves
and
brain
and
i
crackled
with
eagerness
to
fight
for
my
own
no
would
not
give
up
all
that
i
held
dear
i
would
fight
i
gripped
shoulders
in
a
spasm
of
fierce
joy
and
in
a
hoarse
guttural
voice
that
surprised
her
no
more
than
it
surprised
me
i
breathed
out
never
fear
be
it
be
he
done
it
yet
do
know
what
as
yet
but
give
me
little
work
it
out
fight
if
we
we
give
up
tamely
warm
cheek
against
mine
though
with
a
trust
that
can
only
be
described
as
childlike
was
reward
enough
for
victory
let
alone
for
this
still
empty
challenge
but
an
irresistible
throbbing
feeling
of
confidence
tells
me
that
something
will
i
shall
win
is
it
simply
the
confidence
of
a
fool
and
the
surge
of
melodrama
that
is
never
very
far
from
any
of
us
possibly
but
my
blood
still
throbs
and
my
muscles
still
crackle
with
the
strange
eagerness
and
lust
for
battle
it
may
be
that
the
fragrance
and
the
starry
look
of
alicia
that
linger
with
me
yet
the
sweet
joy
and
pride
of
alicia
when
she
returned
my
kiss
before
she
left
me
the
affection
with
which
she
clung
the
reluctance
with
which
she
went
all
have
something
to
do
with
this
new
accession
of
courage
but
i
do
not
comfort
myself
with
vain
things
alicia
happens
to
be
a
girl
whose
affections
have
never
been
pampered
by
any
doting
parents
if
she
looks
upon
me
loco
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
me
it
is
not
enough
and
the
pain
of
that
leaves
a
barbed
sting
in
my
breast
but
that
wound
i
shall
carry
shall
wear
my
hair
shirt
like
the
girl
wife
of
jacopone
da
only
i
can
play
the
man
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
a
first
day
of
a
new
life
and
what
a
day
i
went
down
in
the
train
with
pendleton
and
briskly
suggested
that
he
need
not
hurry
with
his
arrangements
i
thought
said
he
with
a
furtive
sidelong
glance
at
me
that
my
first
duty
was
to
ease
you
i
owe
you
too
much
already
he
added
looking
out
toward
the
drabness
of
the
mt
vernon
right
of
way
only
strangers
and
enemies
that
owe
each
other
things
i
countered
easily
friends
owe
each
other
everything
and
nothing
there
is
no
audit
for
such
accounts
he
laughed
out
of
proportion
to
the
deserts
of
this
lump
of
wisdom
and
exclaimed
great
it
was
my
turn
to
laugh
and
i
felt
that
i
had
the
advantage
of
him
with
the
sixth
sense
or
the
pineal
gland
or
whatever
it
is
i
was
conscious
that
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
that
did
not
damage
my
temper
your
experience
in
life
has
been
i
told
him
that
anybody
would
be
glad
to
be
of
any
service
possible
and
you
must
remember
that
laura
was
my
only
sister
tell
me
i
added
conversationally
you
find
the
harness
galling
at
times
after
have
been
through
galling
say
randolph
those
little
machine
people
in
their
skyscraper
know
what
living
is
for
the
first
time
i
had
noted
the
light
of
spontaneity
glowing
in
his
eyes
and
my
heart
bounded
i
was
about
to
hear
a
confession
but
on
a
sudden
he
checked
himself
and
looked
away
of
course
he
added
in
a
forced
tone
one
has
to
face
responsibilities
it
all
in
all
i
am
glad
to
be
doing
my
share
of
the
work
and
carrying
my
burden
i
knew
he
was
lying
i
knew
that
his
first
outburst
was
the
true
pendleton
that
the
addendum
was
meant
as
politicians
say
for
home
consumption
of
course
of
course
i
muttered
hastily
but
only
human
and
alternately
i
cudgeled
my
poor
wits
to
stand
by
me
and
prayed
to
them
as
to
deities
to
light
my
way
this
lawless
spirit
pendleton
i
had
a
vague
gleam
of
intuition
was
repenting
his
return
to
the
yoke
of
duty
to
the
restraints
of
civilization
what
then
was
it
that
held
him
it
was
not
a
suddenly
developed
conscience
of
that
i
was
certain
there
was
a
problem
i
must
solve
and
solve
immediately
we
parted
with
cordiality
at
grand
central
station
and
twenty
minutes
later
i
was
one
of
those
little
machines
functioning
at
i
want
a
draft
at
thirty
days
i
was
saying
for
ten
thousand
lire
on
naples
your
best
rate
at
that
date
and
with
the
receiver
to
my
ear
i
heard
a
voice
within
me
independent
of
the
telephone
whispering
could
it
be
that
he
too
is
bewitched
by
alicia
all
his
roving
and
is
it
his
sense
of
duty
to
his
children
four
said
the
exchange
man
hoskyns
at
the
national
city
and
four
i
repeated
after
him
automatically
you
do
thirty
days
and
the
independent
voice
in
my
brain
put
in
perhaps
i
am
hipped
upon
the
subject
of
alicia
and
so
the
morning
wore
on
gertrude
to
my
surprise
and
confusion
rang
me
up
at
eleven
good
morning
ranny
she
opened
sweetly
you
kept
your
promise
have
you
promise
i
repeated
dully
what
promise
you
said
you
would
keep
me
informed
about
return
you
done
you
but
you
have
been
away
for
the
summer
you
i
ventured
desperately
yes
and
i
am
back
she
murmured
gently
and
come
and
lunch
with
me
you
think
so
if
any
one
thing
that
my
career
as
a
business
man
has
done
for
me
it
is
to
implant
in
my
heart
a
hatred
for
procrastination
and
shiftiness
i
had
no
luncheon
engagement
and
yet
i
despairingly
told
her
i
had
dinner
she
answered
would
suit
me
even
better
i
ought
to
go
home
i
protested
feebly
with
a
sinking
instinctive
feeling
that
i
really
ought
not
to
resume
such
relations
with
gertrude
have
an
early
little
meal
at
she
smoothly
ignored
me
until
then
i
clicked
the
receiver
angrily
for
a
moment
but
gertrude
had
hung
up
her
manner
irritated
me
but
that
was
her
characteristic
we
were
more
leagues
apart
gertrude
and
i
than
ever
she
or
i
could
travel
backward
and
though
the
results
of
our
meeting
seemed
to
be
unsatisfactory
to
gertrude
i
must
in
justice
to
her
admit
that
she
is
always
an
admirable
hostess
i
had
telephoned
to
my
house
that
i
was
not
to
be
expected
to
dinner
and
when
griselda
had
dryly
answered
ye
know
what
miss
i
thought
with
a
pang
that
i
knew
more
about
that
than
she
did
calm
and
comfortable
atmosphere
however
her
deep
chairs
and
sofas
and
the
air
of
excluding
a
disorderly
world
were
not
disagreeable
to
one
fresh
from
the
filthy
pavements
south
of
fourth
street
could
those
junk
shops
factories
delicatessen
garages
and
machine
shops
be
in
the
same
world
with
flat
in
gramercy
park
yet
they
were
only
a
little
more
than
a
mile
away
and
those
were
my
real
world
my
daily
environment
flat
was
now
foreign
ground
of
a
man
you
see
what
could
be
better
the
man
comes
back
anxious
to
reassume
his
responsibilities
you
have
had
a
hades
of
a
time
but
you
have
done
the
square
thing
acquitted
yourself
like
a
man
and
a
hero
and
now
the
little
romance
ends
happily
and
everything
is
satisfactory
and
you
are
free
could
be
more
delightful
the
heaviness
of
my
heart
portended
anything
but
delight
but
i
remained
silent
think
i
am
being
trivial
ranny
she
resumed
with
a
more
sober
vehemence
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
do
i
feel
i
was
wrong
in
what
i
advised
in
the
past
your
sticking
to
the
children
has
done
heaps
for
your
development
i
for
you
than
for
them
perhaps
she
inserted
as
a
parenthesis
with
a
laugh
but
be
quixotic
now
coming
right
in
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
so
go
throwing
a
wrench
into
the
machinery
just
because
had
the
wrench
in
your
hand
so
long
you
think
what
else
to
do
with
it
i
am
not
good
at
changes
i
murmured
gloomily
i
was
catapulted
from
one
kind
of
life
into
another
by
main
force
of
circumstances
now
i
feel
i
can
stand
being
shot
back
into
something
else
the
wear
and
tear
the
strain
is
too
great
i
will
not
deny
that
what
i
chiefly
saw
at
that
moment
was
a
disruption
that
would
rob
me
not
only
of
the
affection
of
the
children
of
which
i
could
not
speak
but
of
alicia
of
whom
i
could
speak
even
less
gertrude
graciously
lit
a
cigarette
for
me
and
sat
down
beside
me
she
herself
however
was
not
smoking
there
is
one
change
ranny
she
began
in
a
new
and
strange
voice
that
was
almost
tender
that
would
do
you
more
good
than
anything
else
in
the
you
guess
what
i
mean
a
trip
abroad
i
fumbled
uncertainly
no
gertrude
quietly
laying
her
hand
on
mine
i
oh
my
god
i
exclaimed
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
and
a
cold
perspiration
bedewed
my
forehead
that
was
one
thing
i
never
had
expected
gertrude
to
discuss
with
me
again
even
in
the
abstract
i
do
not
remember
what
i
ate
except
that
the
dinner
was
dainty
and
cool
and
exquisite
there
was
a
dewy
cup
of
something
light
and
refreshing
and
frock
was
charming
her
eyes
were
bright
and
there
was
a
touch
of
color
in
her
cheeks
she
did
little
talking
herself
at
first
but
pressed
me
to
tell
her
all
i
could
of
pendleton
i
told
her
i
told
her
of
his
coming
of
his
air
of
penitence
of
his
returning
to
the
offices
of
the
insurance
company
and
of
his
present
effort
to
reëstablish
a
home
for
his
children
the
only
suppressions
i
was
conscious
of
were
any
references
to
alicia
or
to
my
own
somber
emotions
on
the
score
of
the
children
otherwise
i
was
frank
enough
heaven
knows
for
it
is
hard
for
me
not
to
be
to
the
very
end
gertrude
did
not
interrupt
me
only
when
i
had
done
she
made
one
crisp
incisive
comment
with
a
faint
smile
that
was
merely
a
lift
of
the
upper
lip
the
one
thing
i
can
not
understand
ranny
she
observed
is
your
unreasonable
skepticism
you
feel
you
could
trust
such
a
man
implicitly
i
demanded
yes
was
the
firm
reply
if
there
is
any
one
thing
clear
it
is
that
jim
pendleton
is
genuinely
penitent
suppose
that
story
is
all
moonshine
as
you
and
dibdin
seem
to
think
by
coming
back
that
way
the
man
really
display
more
character
than
if
it
were
true
he
really
shows
that
if
gone
wrong
he
has
the
stamina
to
come
right
a
good
deal
in
this
wicked
world
ranny
i
had
not
looked
at
it
in
that
light
i
muttered
disturbed
i
know
you
she
gave
a
triumphant
laugh
you
be
calm
on
the
subject
you
really
are
an
emotional
romantic
ranny
and
i
altogether
blame
you
for
being
prejudiced
but
any
dispassionate
person
knowing
the
facts
will
tell
you
i
am
right
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
feel
dispassionate
on
the
subject
i
returned
doggedly
certainly
it
would
was
her
ready
reply
why
i
am
glad
i
captured
you
some
friend
had
to
show
you
your
own
interest
my
interest
ranny
she
cried
in
a
voice
charged
with
purpose
if
not
with
emotion
an
intense
a
vibrating
resolution
that
impinged
like
a
heavy
weight
upon
my
senses
be
are
too
old
for
that
let
bygones
be
bygones
humiliate
myself
before
you
love
you
and
her
lips
really
i
have
always
loved
you
marry
me
ranny
her
face
seemed
strange
transformed
by
the
force
of
an
irresistible
a
final
compulsion
i
writhed
under
her
gaze
as
one
on
a
rack
she
hung
for
a
moment
her
eyes
glittering
into
mine
positively
tremulous
i
had
never
seen
gertrude
so
serious
i
could
not
bear
it
it
was
excruciating
i
know
gertrude
was
not
herself
i
leaped
from
the
sofa
her
hand
still
clinging
to
mine
i
gertrude
i
whispered
hoarsely
i
am
horribly
nerves
are
strong
and
her
control
over
them
is
stronger
she
gazed
at
me
for
an
instant
intently
searchingly
dropped
my
hand
and
turned
away
there
is
some
one
else
she
murmured
in
level
tones
to
herself
there
is
some
one
else
now
yes
i
breathed
though
it
and
i
paused
you
tell
me
she
turned
smiling
harshly
i
that
it
matter
every
man
is
a
you
are
the
least
likely
to
prove
an
exception
oh
i
always
knew
never
mind
i
humiliate
myself
any
more
can
i
her
voice
suddenly
struck
a
quieter
note
one
thing
i
must
ask
for
our
old
sake
you
will
forget
you
not
and
i
shall
try
to
my
dear
i
threw
out
my
hands
in
a
gesture
of
helplessness
if
there
was
any
humiliation
it
was
i
who
was
suffering
it
she
looked
at
me
calmly
stonily
the
color
in
her
cheeks
was
exactly
the
same
as
before
had
gertrude
stooped
to
rouge
your
dear
then
all
right
have
a
drink
before
you
go
no
very
well
you
will
remember
some
day
that
i
have
given
you
my
my
best
for
you
it
seems
inherent
in
the
nature
of
woman
so
cosmic
is
the
sweep
of
her
outlook
or
else
so
near
to
the
earth
that
when
her
desires
are
frustrated
she
feels
the
laws
of
the
universe
are
frustrated
i
did
not
make
this
comment
to
gertrude
however
i
could
only
murmur
an
entreaty
for
her
she
ignored
her
only
answer
was
a
brief
hard
gesture
of
the
head
a
sort
of
jerk
that
expressed
at
once
futility
contempt
and
dismissal
as
one
dazed
and
paralyzed
i
must
have
made
my
way
somehow
downstairs
into
a
street
car
or
some
other
conveyance
at
fourth
avenue
and
into
the
babel
at
grand
central
station
but
of
this
i
have
no
recollection
whatsoever
it
is
a
blank
i
must
have
walked
like
a
somnambulist
i
never
came
to
until
i
left
the
train
at
crestlands
about
a
quarter
past
nine
and
the
first
thing
i
was
conscious
of
was
the
pain
i
must
have
inflicted
i
can
write
this
almost
calmly
now
because
so
much
has
passed
since
that
dreadful
evening
and
details
begin
to
emerge
cloudily
from
the
fog
of
that
confusion
i
remember
striking
out
homeward
from
the
station
down
our
drably
progressive
suburban
main
street
following
the
bumping
grinding
loitering
trolley
across
the
little
bridge
over
a
stream
that
sends
up
a
dank
fishy
odor
though
all
the
living
things
i
have
ever
seen
in
its
neighborhood
were
mosquitoes
and
water
snakes
over
the
rusty
iron
parapet
i
stood
leaning
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
original
thought
feebly
stirred
my
dazed
brain
that
life
was
not
so
much
a
the
spaniard
calderon
would
have
it
is
a
stream
there
is
no
knowing
what
it
may
not
bring
upon
its
bosom
it
i
muttered
to
myself
aloud
life
is
a
stream
within
a
dream
about
the
size
of
it
gruffly
remarked
a
passing
laborer
behind
me
his
dinner
pail
clanking
against
his
side
and
he
burst
into
a
hoarse
guffaw
i
laughed
too
and
concluded
that
i
was
still
maudlin
at
the
end
of
my
perfect
day
i
left
the
bridge
and
the
highway
turned
to
the
right
and
began
to
climb
the
crooked
street
anciently
a
dutch
cattle
track
no
doubt
that
leads
to
my
isolated
châlet
upon
the
rock
with
all
geography
history
the
visible
and
invisible
universe
to
draw
upon
the
fathers
of
crestlands
had
denominated
this
obscure
street
milwaukee
avenue
milwaukee
avenue
put
the
last
touch
to
my
nightmarish
state
a
sickly
laugh
escaped
me
as
i
bent
my
back
to
the
ascent
a
young
mounted
policeman
who
rode
like
another
lancelot
by
this
remote
shalott
interrupted
his
tune
long
enough
to
give
me
a
cheery
greeting
and
rode
on
humming
to
himself
the
september
evening
was
mild
and
i
vaguely
purposed
walking
past
my
house
and
strolling
about
for
a
bit
before
i
went
in
it
was
early
for
returning
from
dinner
in
town
and
i
was
not
overanxious
to
encounter
anybody
a
sudden
sense
of
something
eerie
and
awesome
came
to
me
as
i
looked
at
that
deeply
shadowed
cottage
it
appeared
unfamiliarly
remote
detached
and
i
gazed
upon
it
with
a
weird
sense
of
foreboding
that
sent
a
slight
shiver
down
my
back
the
window
shades
of
the
châlet
were
drawn
with
only
their
rectangular
lines
of
light
showing
through
i
reflected
bitterly
by
which
pendleton
was
no
doubt
beguiling
alicia
to
desert
my
house
and
follow
him
this
thought
lodged
like
a
barb
in
my
heart
and
my
feet
suddenly
turned
to
lead
i
could
not
go
on
farther
and
irresistibly
i
felt
myself
drawn
homeward
the
somber
habit
of
my
recent
reflections
urged
me
with
a
plausibility
strange
and
inexplicable
to
enter
my
study
by
the
window
instead
of
the
comparatively
public
door
the
window
nearly
always
stood
open
in
case
of
storm
griselda
or
alicia
would
dash
about
the
house
and
close
the
windows
beginning
always
with
my
study
but
this
day
had
been
clear
i
tiptoed
around
through
the
garden
to
the
side
upon
which
my
study
window
gives
from
it
the
land
slopes
away
under
a
covering
of
trees
until
it
reaches
the
stream
there
was
a
light
in
the
study
though
the
shade
was
drawn
flapping
gently
against
the
rusty
wire
screen
this
shade
as
it
happens
does
not
quite
fit
it
is
short
a
full
on
either
side
so
that
the
peering
observer
can
see
as
much
as
he
pleases
of
what
is
going
on
in
that
room
when
it
is
lighted
automatically
without
any
premeditation
that
i
can
now
recall
i
gazed
into
my
own
room
like
a
prowling
thief
the
picture
i
saw
riveted
me
to
the
spot
with
an
irresistible
magnetic
force
alicia
was
reclining
on
my
leather
couch
seemingly
asleep
instinctively
i
knew
that
she
had
decided
to
wait
up
for
me
and
with
some
book
in
her
hands
had
nodded
in
her
vigil
it
was
still
early
but
day
began
early
and
was
always
charged
with
activity
what
an
exquisite
picture
she
made
as
she
lay
there
in
her
thin
frock
with
a
look
of
childlike
trust
and
beauty
pendleton
who
at
that
moment
entered
the
door
of
the
study
possibly
to
find
alicia
stood
for
a
few
moments
spellbound
by
the
picture
even
as
i
stood
outside
my
burglarious
entry
was
now
frustrated
i
must
make
use
of
the
door
but
i
could
not
move
from
the
spot
somehow
i
could
not
let
pendleton
out
of
my
sight
how
dared
he
look
at
her
in
that
manner
my
nerves
were
suddenly
tense
and
my
muscles
quivering
strange
unfamiliar
thoughts
of
savage
acts
of
sudden
violence
of
thrusts
and
blows
of
seethed
and
bubbled
within
me
like
a
lurid
boiling
pitch
the
inhibitions
and
restraints
of
a
lifetime
however
held
me
writhing
as
in
a
vise
i
turned
away
for
a
twinkling
as
though
to
gather
resolution
from
the
murmurous
night
on
a
sudden
as
i
peered
again
eagerly
i
saw
great
hulk
bending
over
her
with
a
look
peculiar
and
intense
with
a
strange
speculation
in
his
eyes
that
froze
me
his
huge
hands
were
spasmodically
irresistibly
hovering
as
if
to
embrace
her
delicate
unconscious
shoulders
before
i
knew
it
he
was
kissing
her
cheek
and
it
was
felt
his
hot
vile
breath
as
though
face
and
mine
were
one
i
cried
out
in
a
torment
of
fury
and
pain
but
only
a
hoarse
distant
sound
as
of
some
night
bird
issued
out
of
my
parched
constricted
throat
i
rattled
the
sash
violently
seized
the
screen
and
ripped
it
out
tearing
my
hands
with
the
cheap
twisted
screen
frame
though
i
was
unaware
of
it
then
the
thin
opaque
shade
flapped
defiantly
in
my
face
and
all
at
once
i
heard
a
piercing
terrified
voice
of
alicia
rage
maddened
me
and
because
of
my
state
i
experienced
difficulty
this
time
of
all
times
in
entering
the
window
out
of
which
normally
i
stepped
with
ease
i
stumbled
slipped
fell
rose
again
and
leaped
into
the
room
like
a
maniac
but
griselda
drawn
by
scream
no
doubt
was
already
filling
the
doorway
facing
pendleton
and
with
a
look
of
concentrated
hatred
that
remains
engraved
in
my
memory
she
was
saying
ye
blackguard
ye
vile
blackguard
with
a
wild
leap
to
my
table
i
seized
a
pointed
bronze
paper
cutter
i
should
have
plunged
it
into
his
heart
but
for
the
swift
intervention
of
the
aged
griselda
no
she
cried
huskily
seizing
the
blade
we
need
nae
add
murder
to
this
i
dropped
the
paper
cutter
to
the
floor
and
threw
myself
at
the
purple
throat
of
the
beast
pendleton
for
a
moment
the
guilty
look
left
his
eyes
and
with
an
oath
he
thrust
out
his
open
hands
against
my
face
to
throw
me
off
i
was
blinded
by
his
huge
hot
palms
against
my
eyes
but
i
clung
convulsively
to
his
throat
his
hands
spasmodically
closed
about
my
neck
a
momentary
blackness
fell
upon
me
but
i
clung
my
fingers
eating
more
savagely
into
the
hateful
flesh
of
his
throat
the
force
of
years
of
hostility
was
that
instant
in
my
destroying
hands
he
gurgled
and
gasped
and
reeled
backward
in
the
meanwhile
alicia
emerging
from
her
bewilderment
and
realizing
the
scene
enacting
itself
with
rapidity
gave
a
low
cry
and
sat
up
moaning
with
terror
this
vision
of
alicia
recalled
me
to
myself
i
flung
his
head
away
from
me
and
i
myself
staggered
backward
with
the
force
of
my
effort
i
was
breathing
like
a
wrestler
as
i
stood
leaning
with
one
hand
upon
the
table
i
could
not
speak
my
desire
was
to
fold
alicia
in
my
arms
to
press
her
to
me
exulting
in
her
safety
but
i
dared
not
move
for
fear
i
should
topple
and
fall
with
the
sheer
working
of
the
rage
that
was
tearing
me
i
gasped
out
finally
upstairs
leave
us
dead
banal
phrases
when
i
panted
to
pour
out
endearments
with
a
look
of
wild
anxiety
from
pendleton
to
me
like
a
terrified
doe
alicia
rose
stood
for
a
moment
irresolute
then
suddenly
throwing
up
her
hands
to
her
face
she
ran
out
of
the
room
with
a
piteous
stifled
cry
we
stood
for
a
space
silent
all
three
of
us
griselda
pendleton
and
i
after
the
door
had
closed
now
pendleton
i
said
finally
when
i
was
a
little
more
sure
of
my
voice
nothing
you
can
say
will
matter
in
the
slightest
we
saw
question
is
what
mean
to
do
he
glanced
hostilely
toward
griselda
she
interpreting
his
look
flashed
defiantly
with
arms
akimbo
look
ye
villain
look
your
fill
i
will
na
leave
the
master
alone
with
a
murderer
the
likes
of
you
no
i
will
na
how
often
i
have
wished
since
then
that
she
had
not
been
so
zealous
talk
about
murder
pendleton
with
the
ghost
of
a
grin
pointed
at
the
paper
knife
still
clutched
in
hand
you
be
afraid
on
my
account
i
told
griselda
quietly
i
fear
him
i
will
na
go
away
obstinately
retorted
griselda
moving
forward
pushing
pendleton
aside
like
a
man
and
placing
her
back
against
the
door
very
well
griselda
i
said
i
have
no
secrets
to
hide
from
you
and
this
man
has
betrayed
what
he
can
never
hope
to
hide
pendleton
what
do
you
mean
to
do
muttered
pendleton
with
a
dark
abstraction
in
his
look
like
to
tell
you
what
like
to
do
to
such
as
it
worth
while
this
mollycoddle
rotten
favors
you
do
if
i
had
the
money
get
so
far
away
i
even
think
of
insects
like
you
then
you
realize
you
are
no
more
fit
to
take
children
than
fit
to
live
among
decent
people
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
with
the
abstraction
merging
into
cunning
in
his
eye
and
that
in
turn
as
though
cunning
were
of
no
avail
fading
into
heaviness
become
like
you
he
finally
answered
with
the
somber
trace
of
a
sneer
the
oldest
make
a
man
of
him
a
snort
of
derision
from
griselda
interrupted
you
mean
a
criminal
i
put
in
in
spite
of
myself
well
you
pendleton
lift
a
finger
and
as
surely
as
you
sit
there
prosecute
or
no
children
forget
i
have
witnesses
he
gazed
at
me
with
on
his
moist
fleshy
countenance
your
little
scheme
is
it
he
muttered
sardonically
only
if
you
drive
me
to
it
blackmail
eh
i
laughed
at
him
the
use
of
being
melodramatic
pendleton
you
are
hardly
the
one
to
talk
like
that
the
money
laura
left
he
snapped
with
truculent
sharpness
and
i
experienced
a
pang
of
pain
to
hear
her
name
upon
his
lips
nevertheless
i
answered
him
evenly
that
exists
nineteen
hundred
dollars
the
unless
i
should
need
it
for
their
education
i
am
the
executor
give
me
a
thousand
of
that
he
cried
passionately
yet
with
a
tentative
uncertainty
in
his
voice
and
go
where
never
see
your
face
again
a
consummation
of
that
not
a
penny
executor
he
repeated
with
vicious
with
your
little
laws
and
safeguards
god
how
i
hate
you
all
god
to
be
again
where
real
men
live
peddling
white
mice
damn
you
i
wish
to
god
i
had
never
met
any
of
you
you
know
how
often
i
have
wished
that
i
murmured
but
he
paid
no
heed
lord
i
want
to
be
again
where
the
sun
shines
where
a
man
can
take
a
chance
i
wish
to
god
i
had
never
met
that
moldy
old
rotten
dibdin
i
was
going
into
the
commission
business
with
an
englishman
at
i
could
have
gone
into
one
of
the
mines
of
kuhara
in
a
fortune
spoke
as
if
he
were
vehemently
thinking
but
that
plausible
rotter
dibdin
came
me
i
had
a
hankering
for
the
lights
of
broadway
broadway
what
have
i
seen
of
it
want
to
put
me
in
a
a
flat
hell
man
give
me
a
thousand
let
pay
it
back
i
did
not
laugh
at
his
last
words
his
mention
of
dibdin
suddenly
brought
to
my
mind
what
was
like
a
flash
of
light
to
be
rid
of
him
was
my
paramount
desire
be
used
for
the
it
lay
yellowing
in
my
pocketbook
now
if
ever
was
the
time
never
i
felt
certain
after
confession
could
i
benefit
the
children
more
with
a
thousand
dollars
yes
i
cried
explosively
i
understand
you
pendleton
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
you
belong
was
a
mistake
bringing
where
you
came
be
at
home
it
was
only
afterwards
i
recalled
that
he
had
mentioned
blackmail
give
it
to
me
he
exclaimed
avidly
thrusting
out
his
hand
will
now
morning
his
face
fell
some
trick
go
back
on
it
i
ignored
him
but
you
sleep
here
i
went
on
meet
you
in
town
anywhere
you
say
no
tell
you
what
do
come
with
you
to
town
now
morning
settle
it
to
be
rid
of
get
him
out
from
under
this
suddenly
a
great
a
priceless
boon
god
i
could
kiss
you
he
cried
in
derisive
exultation
go
pack
your
things
i
said
through
the
tumult
in
my
brain
call
a
better
still
you
telephone
hickson
griselda
go
and
help
him
pendleton
nodded
with
grim
insolence
and
shouldered
out
of
the
door
a
better
work
never
done
in
your
life
flashed
griselda
with
a
look
of
approbation
that
pleased
me
as
much
as
any
praise
i
have
ever
received
and
she
shuffled
out
to
the
telephone
for
one
moment
of
silence
i
stood
alone
in
the
middle
of
my
study
throbbing
with
a
jumble
of
thoughts
and
racing
flashes
of
ideas
upon
none
of
which
my
mind
was
able
to
fasten
but
this
single
fact
finally
emerged
from
the
welter
it
was
i
by
my
own
act
who
was
now
sending
the
father
of
children
into
exile
but
on
the
heels
of
that
came
the
certain
conviction
that
never
had
any
judge
since
justice
was
invented
made
a
more
accurate
decision
and
it
seemed
to
me
then
as
though
something
new
and
massive
and
stubborn
and
hard
was
born
in
my
bosom
that
solidified
and
toughened
me
that
come
sorrow
or
joy
i
should
be
able
to
present
a
surer
front
to
their
encounter
a
greater
certitude
in
meeting
them
i
felt
myself
at
last
an
active
fashioned
and
tempered
part
of
the
machinery
of
life
and
all
my
past
seemed
as
chaff
that
had
been
blown
by
the
winds
of
circumstance
alicia
my
heart
cried
out
for
her
but
i
could
not
go
to
her
now
i
must
clean
my
house
for
her
and
when
next
i
saw
her
it
should
be
in
a
cleared
and
wholesome
atmosphere
that
no
longer
reeked
of
pendleton
i
made
my
way
to
his
room
and
opened
the
door
have
you
packing
space
enough
i
asked
him
coldly
i
could
use
another
suit
case
he
muttered
give
you
mine
i
told
him
and
brought
forth
my
bag
from
a
closet
in
the
hall
whether
alicia
had
heard
any
or
all
of
our
words
i
could
not
tell
the
children
were
evidently
sleeping
i
walked
on
tiptoe
where
intend
to
go
growled
pendleton
without
looking
at
me
to
an
hotel
i
told
him
any
hotel
you
like
go
to
the
hotel
de
gink
for
all
i
care
he
muttered
and
went
on
with
his
packing
do
you
want
to
see
the
children
before
you
go
i
could
not
forbear
asking
him
that
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
straightened
up
breathing
heavily
then
he
shook
his
head
guess
not
the
tin
taxicab
was
rattling
at
the
door
and
griselda
came
futilely
to
announce
it
hear
from
me
morning
some
time
i
whispered
to
her
quickly
as
pendleton
stooping
under
his
bags
lumbered
on
in
front
of
me
look
after
the
others
ay
she
murmured
have
no
fear
there
was
a
train
and
in
the
longest
of
any
journey
we
were
at
the
manhattan
hotel
adjoining
rooms
were
assigned
to
us
with
a
bathroom
between
there
had
been
a
sort
of
intoxication
about
the
entire
business
that
had
carried
me
on
with
a
blind
nameless
force
as
one
is
carried
in
a
dream
once
i
was
alone
in
the
four
walls
of
the
impersonal
chamber
a
sudden
lassitude
fell
upon
me
followed
by
an
immense
wave
of
dreariness
how
somber
and
sinister
was
life
full
of
a
drab
and
hidden
tragedy
trafficking
with
at
dreams
that
had
been
mine
and
this
was
the
life
i
was
living
suppose
in
the
morning
he
should
refuse
on
a
sudden
my
door
opened
and
hatless
head
appeared
sure
you
back
out
in
the
morning
and
again
my
nerves
snapped
back
into
their
tension
not
even
doomsday
morning
will
you
have
a
drink
on
it
no
i
told
him
but
there
is
no
reason
why
you
have
one
i
think
i
will
he
said
and
with
a
malign
gleam
of
triumph
he
approached
the
telephone
in
my
room
the
bar
he
demanded
and
when
the
connection
was
made
he
added
two
rye
highs
for
then
he
turned
his
face
toward
me
and
grinned
now
randolph
he
began
quite
amicably
why
keep
me
here
any
longer
than
you
can
help
what
mean
this
only
about
to
eleven
there
must
be
a
train
for
the
west
round
midnight
why
prolong
the
sweet
agony
of
not
let
me
go
now
you
must
be
crazy
i
exploded
nervously
how
can
i
get
the
money
for
you
besides
another
want
you
to
sign
a
lawyer
must
draw
paper
of
some
you
repeat
this
business
so
it
he
nodded
his
heavy
head
up
and
down
as
though
thinking
aloud
well
put
that
out
of
your
mind
sign
nothing
take
me
for
a
fool
your
chance
give
me
the
money
now
and
let
me
go
or
the
off
see
just
as
anxious
to
go
as
to
have
me
go
but
i
born
yesterday
sign
no
papers
in
any
damn
office
take
it
or
leave
it
that
there
was
something
unspeakably
horrible
to
me
about
sitting
there
and
chaffering
with
this
man
whose
every
word
breathed
contamination
for
a
moment
the
thought
of
dibdin
came
to
me
i
would
call
upon
dibdin
in
this
emergency
dibdin
had
hardly
been
near
me
of
late
excepting
for
an
occasional
luncheon
together
or
a
sporadic
telephone
conversation
i
had
scarcely
seen
him
it
was
as
though
he
dreaded
to
encounter
the
monster
pendleton
whom
in
a
sort
he
had
himself
brought
into
being
and
was
only
waiting
until
i
should
be
free
of
him
but
somehow
i
could
not
then
call
dibdin
this
was
crisis
and
my
mind
revolted
at
dragging
any
one
else
into
it
oddly
enough
it
was
not
the
children
that
seemed
to
be
the
barrier
but
alicia
the
picture
of
pendleton
obscenely
hovering
over
her
came
scorching
before
my
vision
and
i
at
once
dismissed
the
thought
of
calling
upon
dibdin
the
club
was
my
one
chance
of
getting
cash
at
that
hour
the
matter
with
your
club
pendleton
snapped
me
up
so
suddenly
that
i
was
startled
could
that
fleshy
brute
read
my
thoughts
just
what
i
was
thinking
of
i
murmured
excitedly
and
snatched
up
the
telephone
give
me
bryant
damn
a
sport
i
like
a
dead
game
bird
like
you
when
the
club
answered
i
asked
whether
fred
salmon
happened
to
be
in
and
was
informed
that
the
doorman
thought
he
was
and
that
he
would
page
him
i
sat
waiting
with
the
receiver
to
my
ear
tell
you
what
do
said
pendleton
under
the
stimulus
of
expectation
if
you
pull
this
off
for
me
so
i
can
start
while
the
on
me
sign
any
damn
thing
you
please
hello
i
suddenly
heard
in
fred
deep
voice
salmon
speaking
fred
i
told
him
this
is
randolph
byrd
hello
ranny
he
broke
in
exuberantly
well
of
all
the
but
i
checked
him
want
to
cash
a
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
right
now
fred
i
am
at
the
manhattan
hotel
the
banks
are
closed
will
you
do
this
for
me
ask
at
the
office
and
turn
out
your
pockets
and
get
what
you
can
from
any
of
the
card
players
there
and
anybody
else
you
know
do
you
follow
me
i
get
you
all
said
the
voice
of
fred
hardening
to
a
businesslike
tone
now
that
money
was
in
question
hold
the
wire
a
minute
ran
see
what
i
can
do
raucous
voice
was
as
plainly
audible
to
pendleton
as
it
was
to
me
get
it
he
muttered
get
it
hate
to
wait
till
i
nodded
to
be
rid
of
him
would
be
a
vast
relief
and
i
longed
to
return
home
i
guess
we
can
fix
it
all
right
came
voice
in
the
telephone
but
better
come
over
with
the
check
about
six
hundred
dollars
in
the
club
till
i
have
a
couple
of
hundred
with
me
and
we
can
raise
the
rest
pendleton
heard
him
go
ahead
he
said
fix
up
about
a
berth
with
the
head
porter
in
the
meanwhile
the
big
idea
was
greeting
as
i
entered
the
club
private
i
told
him
laconically
sending
a
man
to
the
antipodes
because
unfit
to
live
in
this
climate
man
fred
was
sympathetic
very
sick
i
told
him
incurable
fifteen
minutes
later
i
was
in
the
hotel
handing
pendleton
the
money
now
what
want
me
to
sign
he
queried
carelessly
not
a
thing
i
answered
for
on
a
sudden
the
futility
of
holding
pendleton
to
any
bond
overwhelmed
me
any
respite
even
a
few
weeks
from
his
presence
seemed
a
paradise
paradise
seemed
cheap
at
a
thousand
dollars
and
who
can
safeguard
paradise
besides
if
i
knew
my
man
at
all
it
would
be
some
time
before
he
would
return
to
an
environment
he
so
thoroughly
loathed
i
was
no
more
safe
with
his
signature
than
no
less
about
all
then
he
said
and
he
had
the
decency
not
to
hold
out
his
hand
good
luck
he
added
in
an
undertone
i
made
no
answer
and
turned
my
face
away
from
him
with
a
wonderful
sense
of
relief
no
sooner
had
the
porter
bustled
out
with
his
things
and
the
door
closed
than
i
looked
toward
my
own
small
bag
with
the
dominant
thought
of
returning
home
but
i
could
not
move
i
found
myself
shaking
like
a
leaf
and
i
sank
down
in
the
nearest
chair
quivering
as
though
the
vibration
in
my
nerves
would
hurl
my
body
to
pieces
no
i
could
not
go
home
in
this
state
and
taking
off
my
coat
with
hands
that
shook
as
in
a
palsy
i
threw
myself
upon
the
bed
but
before
i
passed
into
the
sleep
of
stupefied
exhaustion
a
single
insistent
foreboding
kept
dully
throbbing
through
my
brain
he
will
come
will
come
back
exultation
filled
me
when
i
awoke
late
in
the
morning
though
i
had
slept
in
my
clothes
and
felt
particularly
disheveled
i
stripped
with
the
joy
of
an
athlete
after
a
victory
and
plunged
into
the
cool
invigorating
bath
pendleton
was
gone
i
do
not
remember
the
emotions
of
sinbad
when
he
had
rid
himself
of
the
old
man
of
the
sea
but
his
emotions
must
have
resembled
mine
my
heart
sang
i
sang
myself
i
was
manumitted
i
was
free
to
my
intimate
journal
may
i
not
say
that
i
felt
myself
a
man
i
had
fought
the
beast
at
ephesus
my
pulses
blasphemously
and
jubilantly
informed
me
and
by
the
lord
i
had
won
the
children
were
mine
alicia
was
mine
would
that
i
could
bind
them
to
me
with
triple
brass
but
i
have
bound
them
in
ridding
myself
of
pendleton
i
had
made
them
securely
mine
suppose
he
should
return
one
day
they
would
be
by
me
he
would
be
merely
the
family
skeleton
what
is
a
family
without
a
skeleton
he
was
that
now
he
matter
it
is
human
destiny
to
revolve
about
the
child
about
children
with
the
exception
of
pendleton
the
outcast
and
gertrude
one
attained
completeness
only
in
rearing
the
next
generation
and
as
i
rubbed
my
body
with
the
coarse
towel
i
felt
complete
as
for
who
was
i
to
expect
from
life
at
any
rate
she
was
mine
now
even
as
the
children
were
mine
and
the
very
first
thing
i
would
jeweled
to
adopt
her
legally
and
formally
that
thought
suddenly
made
the
blood
sing
in
my
ears
to
so
delicious
a
tune
that
absurdly
ridiculously
i
began
like
some
pagan
or
satyr
to
dance
about
the
room
mine
i
danced
into
the
room
in
which
pendleton
had
not
slept
and
with
crazy
gestures
made
as
if
to
sweep
his
memory
out
of
the
garish
window
i
had
saved
the
children
and
safeguarded
alicia
i
felt
i
had
played
the
man
and
let
no
man
say
he
has
lived
until
he
has
fought
for
those
he
loves
inevitably
my
mind
dwelt
upon
alicia
who
is
that
child
what
were
her
beginnings
did
she
come
out
of
the
sea
and
chaos
of
life
only
to
vanish
in
some
bitter
poignant
dream
like
that
of
last
night
i
only
knew
that
she
was
mine
now
and
that
i
would
bind
her
to
me
yet
more
strongly
i
would
not
ask
for
too
much
i
would
be
humbly
grateful
she
had
come
into
my
life
as
a
divine
offering
and
i
would
not
question
overmuch
there
is
no
other
origin
i
felt
supremely
tremulously
content
if
only
she
would
abide
and
never
leave
me
and
it
occurred
to
me
as
i
stood
shaving
before
the
mirror
that
life
is
a
beleaguered
city
with
deadly
arrows
falling
over
the
wall
and
the
great
enemy
death
certain
to
enter
in
the
end
but
by
virtue
of
the
love
implanted
in
the
human
heart
one
may
snatch
many
hours
of
happiness
amid
the
tumult
and
the
shouting
in
the
winding
ways
over
my
hasty
breakfast
i
recalled
with
a
shock
of
guilt
that
i
had
not
yet
communicated
with
griselda
but
as
i
was
already
late
i
decided
i
should
call
her
from
the
office
how
swift
is
mischief
to
enter
in
the
thoughts
of
desperate
men
i
discovered
bitterly
only
a
few
minutes
later
for
the
first
word
i
received
upon
entering
was
that
griselda
had
called
me
repeatedly
and
news
chilled
and
numbed
every
fiber
in
my
body
alicia
had
disappeared
pendleton
that
was
the
thought
that
seared
my
brain
think
stammered
brokenly
to
griselda
that
i
have
thought
of
that
was
her
reply
it
canna
be
possible
she
hated
she
must
hae
gone
before
ye
left
the
house
i
looked
into
her
room
soon
after
and
she
wasna
there
i
thought
the
girlie
was
hiding
maybe
she
had
run
out
into
the
garden
until
the
mischief
should
blow
over
i
looked
high
and
low
i
called
her
in
the
garden
but
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
did
she
take
any
things
i
queried
huskily
a
wee
said
night
things
and
the
like
the
shuddering
dismay
of
that
moment
i
shall
never
forget
did
she
talk
him
at
all
during
the
evening
the
words
struggled
out
of
my
parched
throat
in
spite
of
me
and
i
should
have
hated
to
see
my
own
eyes
ay
said
griselda
that
he
did
the
leper
all
the
evening
he
was
wheedling
her
to
come
to
him
with
the
bairns
when
he
set
up
his
house
she
was
weeping
sair
to
me
in
the
kitchen
afterward
it
was
to
ask
you
if
you
wanted
her
to
go
that
she
waited
for
you
in
the
fell
asleep
the
poor
maidie
and
what
did
you
say
to
her
i
all
but
whispered
into
the
mouthpiece
i
told
the
lass
not
to
greet
shouted
griselda
i
told
her
i
could
nae
believe
it
would
happen
he
would
never
take
the
bairns
and
if
he
did
he
would
nae
keep
them
he
was
a
bad
evil
brute
but
she
was
frightened
the
puir
lassie
very
well
griselda
i
muttered
stonily
i
must
think
i
shall
call
you
a
little
later
alarm
the
others
she
hated
him
had
said
griselda
there
was
a
meager
ray
of
comfort
but
do
what
i
would
my
stunned
mind
continued
to
flutter
heavily
like
a
moth
around
the
ugly
sinister
vision
of
pendleton
could
he
be
at
the
bottom
of
disappearance
how
had
he
contrived
the
trick
if
only
i
had
gone
to
the
station
with
him
was
it
that
that
accounted
for
his
hurry
to
be
gone
no
it
was
impossible
ought
i
to
start
in
pursuit
at
once
no
no
no
i
could
not
believe
it
it
could
not
of
her
own
free
will
yet
my
heart
was
lacerated
by
the
possibility
when
i
lifted
my
head
from
my
bosom
i
gasped
in
a
desolation
of
emptiness
i
had
stifled
the
prompting
to
call
dibdin
last
night
but
now
i
felt
i
must
find
him
i
needed
the
solace
and
advice
of
a
friend
i
rose
heavily
and
put
on
my
hat
visconti
had
not
yet
come
in
tell
visconti
i
said
to
varesi
my
young
understudy
that
i
have
been
called
away
suddenly
on
a
serious
private
matter
i
shall
telephone
him
later
yes
byrd
responded
varesi
his
lustrous
italian
eyes
flashing
sympathy
he
thought
no
doubt
from
what
he
must
have
overheard
that
some
rascal
had
run
off
with
my
younger
killing
matter
very
possibly
to
a
properly
constituted
male
had
he
known
the
truth
his
latin
mind
would
have
been
shocked
at
my
seeming
composure
out
of
doors
i
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
boarded
a
elevated
train
for
the
eighties
where
dibdin
has
his
lodgings
near
the
museum
of
natural
history
i
found
dibdin
not
at
his
lodging
but
at
the
museum
directing
the
rearrangement
of
the
polynesian
section
in
the
light
of
his
additions
to
it
he
turned
one
intense
glance
upon
me
without
speaking
hurriedly
gave
some
directions
to
the
men
at
work
and
led
me
to
an
alcove
where
there
was
a
bench
now
he
said
he
been
doing
he
concluded
at
once
that
pendleton
was
at
the
bottom
of
whatever
wild
appearance
i
must
have
presented
briefly
but
without
omitting
any
essential
detail
i
gave
him
an
account
of
all
that
had
happened
the
previous
evening
including
announcement
of
the
morning
and
you
think
he
enticed
her
to
go
off
with
him
he
demanded
do
you
think
i
queried
i
think
no
said
dibdin
what
does
griselda
say
she
says
alicia
hated
him
then
take
her
word
for
it
snapped
dibdin
but
why
the
devil
you
call
me
last
night
from
the
manhattan
he
turned
upon
me
angrily
why
i
i
murmured
maybe
because
done
because
there
are
some
things
a
man
wants
to
do
without
assistance
dibdin
glanced
at
me
sharply
and
gave
a
low
whistle
oh
he
i
see
and
he
looked
away
i
am
certain
that
at
that
moment
dibdin
read
my
secret
for
his
expression
swiftly
changed
he
grew
suddenly
warm
and
friendly
more
than
his
usual
self
a
fine
job
you
did
there
randolph
he
cried
clapping
my
shoulder
an
excellent
piece
of
work
i
certainly
admire
your
technique
as
for
go
with
that
i
feel
sure
i
could
have
groveled
before
him
in
gratitude
for
those
words
but
where
do
you
suppose
she
is
i
could
not
help
eagerly
asking
there
was
a
gleam
of
amusement
mingled
with
the
sympathy
in
his
eyes
not
very
far
i
imagine
find
her
have
no
fear
young
girls
are
funny
things
the
instinct
of
sacrifice
and
the
instinct
of
independence
are
always
struggling
in
a
woman
like
the
twins
in
womb
when
young
it
hits
them
very
hard
some
notion
like
that
must
have
swamped
her
own
to
be
a
source
of
knows
they
think
when
even
when
old
they
feel
find
got
to
think
pull
yourself
together
old
man
how
i
asked
in
stupefaction
do
you
come
to
know
all
that
about
women
and
my
heart
felt
perceptibly
lightened
at
his
words
oh
been
studying
them
all
my
life
he
laughed
never
having
had
one
of
my
own
been
watching
and
thinking
about
the
whole
sex
all
over
the
earth
find
her
have
you
communicated
with
the
police
at
the
word
police
my
heart
turned
leaden
again
i
stammered
aghast
invoke
the
publicity
that
means
a
shudder
ran
down
my
back
right
again
cried
dibdin
nudging
me
young
man
you
have
an
appreciation
quite
police
but
you
a
suspicion
of
pendleton
you
i
found
myself
wishing
that
even
the
best
of
men
so
ready
to
imagine
themselves
amateur
detectives
the
very
core
of
my
heart
of
hearts
alicia
had
disappeared
and
i
wanted
swift
concrete
help
not
speculative
questions
i
admitted
that
i
had
a
lingering
suspicion
of
pendleton
then
this
is
what
we
do
dibdin
rubbed
his
forehead
as
over
a
problem
in
chess
we
see
a
private
detective
agency
here
and
acquaint
them
with
the
facts
have
them
pick
up
pendleton
on
the
reached
chicago
yet
you
see
if
traveling
alone
if
he
is
let
him
go
on
his
way
if
a
description
of
the
a
livid
fury
possessed
me
suddenly
as
i
saw
the
all
too
vivid
picture
that
dibdin
had
evoked
and
was
now
trying
to
believe
no
no
i
cried
i
am
going
myself
i
dare
can
not
trust
anybody
else
to
do
this
you
i
know
only
too
damned
well
growled
dibdin
staring
at
me
quizzically
but
i
am
trying
to
show
you
i
admit
to
one
in
your
condition
however
i
must
try
again
he
went
on
with
the
patience
of
resignation
you
are
only
one
you
see
a
detective
agency
is
an
organization
of
many
men
in
different
places
who
can
concentrate
on
the
same
job
simultaneously
at
this
minute
they
would
know
on
which
train
he
might
be
traveling
and
some
one
or
several
could
already
be
watching
for
his
arrival
suppose
they
miss
him
there
are
many
hotels
in
are
many
trains
leaving
for
the
you
see
yes
i
breathed
brokenly
then
useless
far
from
it
he
laughed
come
with
me
less
than
an
hour
later
we
were
at
the
mahoney
detective
agency
and
a
suave
young
irishman
was
listening
without
emotion
or
eagerness
to
my
story
supplemented
by
interpolations
he
seemed
to
care
little
for
what
concerned
me
most
but
he
was
keen
for
personal
details
of
appearance
height
build
clothes
lettering
on
his
luggage
and
so
on
when
it
came
to
giving
a
detailed
description
of
alicia
my
confusion
was
so
pitiful
that
even
the
young
detective
glanced
at
me
only
once
and
then
like
the
gentleman
he
was
looked
sedulously
down
upon
the
paper
before
him
her
seventeenth
year
he
murmured
in
astonishment
but
she
is
an
unusual
grown
for
her
age
i
caught
him
up
i
see
he
murmured
gravely
the
color
of
her
hair
i
went
on
as
best
i
could
with
the
description
i
could
save
you
money
he
smiled
blandly
by
telling
you
that
the
girl
is
not
with
and
i
could
have
wrung
his
hand
like
a
but
he
added
it
cost
much
to
pick
him
up
have
news
for
you
this
time
thinking
as
i
sat
down
to
lunch
with
dibdin
at
his
club
though
in
truth
nothing
was
farther
from
my
cravings
than
food
he
suddenly
burst
forth
into
hearty
laughter
so
my
thousand
you
gave
pendleton
he
chuckled
that
was
sheer
inspiration
unadulterated
genius
if
you
so
lugubrious
just
now
i
could
accuse
you
of
a
high
ironic
sense
of
humor
that
only
a
great
man
would
be
capable
of
how
terrible
were
the
next
hours
in
spite
of
companionship
and
his
efforts
to
cheer
me
no
one
will
ever
know
no
funeral
could
possibly
have
darkened
my
household
to
such
an
extent
i
dreaded
to
be
seen
by
the
children
who
walked
about
like
wraiths
under
the
sense
of
tragedy
i
dreaded
to
tell
them
lies
and
yet
i
could
not
tell
them
the
truth
finally
i
felt
i
must
say
something
to
laura
and
randolph
the
departure
of
their
father
they
received
without
the
least
surprise
randolph
inquired
where
he
had
gone
but
this
i
answered
i
could
not
tell
him
save
that
he
had
gone
west
but
the
absence
of
alicia
left
them
puzzled
and
strained
and
awed
disappearance
shook
them
almost
as
it
had
shaken
me
when
will
she
be
back
demanded
randolph
i
know
exactly
i
answered
miserably
soon
i
hope
the
following
morning
i
gave
up
all
thought
of
going
to
the
office
if
my
mysterious
truancy
should
cost
me
my
job
then
it
must
be
so
i
hovered
in
the
region
of
the
telephone
again
and
again
i
was
about
to
call
up
but
i
forebore
finally
toward
noon
i
could
wait
no
longer
when
the
connection
was
made
i
gave
my
name
and
asked
for
the
young
man
who
had
charge
of
my
case
was
just
going
to
call
you
was
the
bland
apologetic
answer
your
man
is
at
the
la
salle
hotel
going
out
on
the
santa
fe
he
is
alone
and
arrived
alone
last
night
see
whether
he
starts
alone
then
of
course
i
cursed
myself
for
my
folly
in
thinking
that
it
might
be
otherwise
and
realized
that
i
had
really
thought
nothing
of
the
sort
but
where
in
the
meanwhile
was
alicia
i
had
believed
myself
by
now
schooled
to
emergencies
but
here
was
an
emergency
that
left
me
dazed
and
helpless
i
had
fondly
thought
myself
a
match
for
life
but
life
was
crushing
me
with
pain
like
a
blind
force
i
leaped
up
suddenly
and
wandered
about
the
house
and
the
garden
like
a
dog
searching
miserably
for
a
departed
loved
one
there
was
the
i
turned
from
it
shivering
was
impossible
the
sense
of
life
in
alicia
her
vitality
was
too
potent
too
radiant
to
suffer
extinction
i
looked
up
at
my
little
nest
from
the
edge
of
the
muddy
stream
that
frail
eyrie
upon
the
rock
that
i
had
felt
so
nestling
secure
barred
by
the
trunks
of
intervening
trees
it
now
seemed
a
prison
a
faint
breeze
that
was
stirring
the
leaves
made
them
murmurous
with
secret
things
which
my
heart
cried
out
to
interpret
was
it
a
litany
a
dirge
or
a
whisper
of
hope
i
could
not
read
the
riddle
but
my
bruised
spirit
was
passionately
clinging
to
hope
dibdin
pretended
not
to
observe
my
vagaries
when
i
returned
i
found
him
absorbed
in
epictetus
this
is
rather
good
he
growled
pointing
to
a
passage
and
puffing
his
pipe
as
he
spoke
have
you
not
received
facilities
by
which
you
may
support
any
event
have
you
not
received
a
manly
soul
have
you
not
received
patience
yes
i
muttered
dejectedly
all
very
well
but
epictetus
never
lost
alicia
dibdin
laughed
shortly
now
he
said
we
must
start
out
to
find
her
though
my
feeling
is
come
back
of
her
own
accord
very
soon
the
girl
was
more
i
ignored
the
last
part
of
his
speech
but
leaped
at
the
first
how
would
you
start
i
queried
sharply
what
is
the
name
of
that
institution
where
she
was
brought
up
oh
tell
them
for
sake
i
cried
out
in
alarm
if
she
is
not
there
and
they
learn
i
have
lost
her
never
consent
to
my
adopting
her
consider
me
irresponsible
be
fools
retorted
dibdin
those
people
are
not
do
you
know
how
many
boys
girls
men
and
women
turn
up
every
year
no
i
know
but
by
george
he
suddenly
clapped
his
forehead
in
a
burst
of
sergeant
cullum
ever
hear
of
sergeant
cullum
i
shook
my
head
he
is
a
policeman
i
know
who
has
a
genius
for
finding
missing
persons
positively
a
sixth
sense
with
him
a
traveled
human
is
the
man
to
go
to
police
i
stammered
yes
i
see
whether
we
can
make
him
take
this
as
a
private
of
find
him
the
surge
of
hope
to
my
eyes
must
have
told
dibdin
better
than
any
words
i
could
have
uttered
what
i
felt
at
that
instant
but
first
call
that
institution
he
directed
you
put
in
a
call
for
the
number
and
tell
you
what
to
say
you
i
decided
after
a
reflection
i
know
i
shall
simply
inquire
about
the
regulations
governing
adoptions
i
can
so
word
it
that
if
alicia
is
there
they
will
tell
me
ah
now
your
brain
is
functioning
again
he
concluded
that
being
so
i
shall
leave
you
and
look
up
cullum
at
the
bureau
of
missing
persons
then
i
recalled
that
i
had
met
with
the
phrase
in
newspapers
the
fact
that
missing
persons
were
so
numerous
that
a
bureau
of
the
metropolitan
police
was
required
to
handle
them
cheered
me
more
than
any
other
single
fact
it
was
consoling
to
feel
that
even
in
my
peculiar
misery
i
had
joined
a
great
multitude
who
suffered
the
loss
of
loved
ones
even
as
in
toil
and
labor
and
poverty
i
had
merged
into
the
vast
majority
when
dibdin
left
me
i
learned
that
i
might
adopt
alicia
without
any
great
obstacles
if
she
were
willing
but
i
was
no
wiser
as
to
her
whereabouts
the
home
in
the
person
of
the
matron
inquired
how
she
was
getting
along
she
was
obviously
not
there
and
i
experienced
a
misery
of
guilt
as
though
i
had
robbed
the
world
of
its
dearest
possession
and
then
lost
it
alone
and
bereft
i
sat
sinking
to
a
mere
point
in
my
abasement
i
had
begun
to
believe
myself
schooled
in
life
something
of
a
man
among
men
but
my
own
ineffectiveness
was
now
dismally
revealed
to
me
i
had
proved
myself
incapable
of
guarding
even
what
was
dearest
to
me
in
the
world
i
was
at
the
bottom
of
an
abyss
from
which
i
now
felt
hopeless
to
scramble
upward
the
sheer
and
beetling
walls
of
granite
were
overpoweringly
steep
and
forbidding
for
the
first
time
in
long
years
i
believe
i
mentally
prayed
i
waited
for
dibdin
and
then
suddenly
as
is
the
way
with
me
when
i
am
at
the
bottom
my
spirits
bounded
upward
alicia
would
come
back
to
me
i
felt
in
a
sudden
surge
of
assurance
at
that
moment
i
felt
sure
that
she
was
thinking
of
me
that
she
was
yearning
to
return
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
blocking
in
magnificent
plans
for
her
education
for
making
a
splendid
woman
of
her
even
though
she
already
seemed
perfect
of
supplementing
handiwork
with
all
the
force
that
was
in
me
i
saw
her
resplendent
a
shining
creature
the
woman
of
my
dreams
what
a
florid
designer
is
hope
but
why
should
she
have
been
taken
from
me
so
abruptly
the
vast
mystery
of
life
encompassed
me
again
like
a
shell
carapace
through
which
nature
must
supply
the
she
had
evidently
not
supplied
them
would
dibdin
never
come
with
his
policeman
books
for
so
long
my
mainstay
and
support
were
now
useless
to
me
i
turned
over
many
volumes
idly
but
my
mind
no
longer
reacted
to
that
old
and
magical
alchemy
the
volume
of
epictetus
that
dibdin
had
fingered
might
have
been
a
seed
catalogue
so
remote
it
seemed
and
so
null
i
was
now
a
ghost
among
my
books
i
was
plunged
in
the
woods
of
westermain
and
my
memory
flung
me
the
lines
enter
these
enchanted
woods
you
who
dare
nothing
harms
beneath
the
leaves
more
than
waves
a
swimmer
cleaves
toss
your
heart
up
with
the
lark
foot
at
peace
with
mouse
and
worm
fair
you
fare
only
at
a
dread
of
dark
quaver
and
they
quit
their
form
thousand
eyeballs
under
hoods
have
you
by
the
hair
enter
these
enchanted
woods
you
who
dare
it
was
clear
i
must
toss
my
heart
up
with
the
lark
to
fare
fairly
even
though
my
pain
was
great
late
that
afternoon
dibdin
returned
bringing
sergeant
cullum
that
excellent
policeman
gave
me
more
hope
than
any
one
excepting
my
own
heart
had
yet
succeeded
in
doing
he
insisted
upon
being
made
privy
to
all
the
circumstances
to
which
he
listened
his
broad
shaven
face
turned
ceilingward
with
the
rapt
air
of
a
mystic
expecting
momentarily
that
lightning
flash
of
inspiration
that
would
reveal
all
then
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
wander
by
himself
throughout
the
house
over
which
he
went
pointing
and
sniffing
like
some
hound
in
the
end
he
declared
himself
satisfied
now
give
me
a
little
time
he
said
but
what
do
you
go
to
work
i
asked
nettled
that
he
should
see
possibilities
regarding
alicia
that
i
had
overlooked
i
swear
byrd
i
know
he
answered
reverently
i
wait
for
guidance
guidance
i
faltered
on
high
you
depend
on
only
yes
and
no
i
pray
pray
you
have
no
other
means
i
queried
with
a
sinking
heart
what
other
means
are
there
he
demanded
with
glowing
eyes
that
the
lord
supply
what
detective
in
the
world
can
equal
the
me
that
mr
byrd
i
saw
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
fanatic
and
i
stood
abashed
the
best
man
in
the
department
dibdin
put
in
encouragingly
sergeant
cullum
the
bureau
of
missing
persons
give
me
a
little
time
he
urged
again
with
the
fervid
intensity
of
and
it
was
alicia
who
was
missing
i
shook
his
hand
and
gave
him
time
and
parted
from
him
with
a
hope
that
i
should
not
have
to
wait
for
his
ecstatic
visions
to
restore
her
find
her
dibdin
exclaimed
reassuringly
never
fear
if
there
is
one
thing
learned
to
accept
the
methods
of
people
so
long
as
they
produce
the
results
let
them
use
the
divining
rod
if
they
want
to
or
incantations
with
henbane
and
hellebore
or
trances
and
visions
or
prayer
this
almost
human
race
of
ours
is
made
up
of
some
very
odd
fish
he
added
with
a
laugh
and
he
looked
at
me
quizzically
as
though
i
were
the
oddest
fish
of
them
all
but
an
ecstatic
policeman
know
said
dibdin
but
i
care
and
now
old
boy
got
to
run
back
to
the
museum
and
take
a
squint
at
the
work
cheer
up
i
was
alone
in
my
study
after
a
pretense
of
eating
supper
with
the
children
when
jimmie
burst
in
and
flung
himself
upon
me
i
want
to
know
where
is
alicia
he
demanded
with
quivering
lips
and
he
burst
into
a
pitiful
freshet
of
bitter
weeping
his
childish
tears
fell
like
scalding
lead
upon
my
hands
and
i
hugged
the
quivering
small
figure
to
me
in
an
anguished
embrace
you
want
laura
to
put
you
to
bed
i
murmured
with
my
lips
against
his
ear
want
laura
he
sobbed
chokingly
want
alicia
to
give
me
my
bath
and
put
me
to
bed
where
is
she
why
she
come
it
was
a
cry
that
tore
at
my
heart
as
it
echoed
there
and
reverberated
i
hugged
him
closer
give
you
your
bath
jimmikins
i
endeavored
to
soothe
him
and
float
ships
he
sobbed
out
as
one
broken
with
tragedy
and
i
declare
i
came
very
near
to
joining
him
in
his
grief
you
a
i
gulped
foolishly
and
until
alicia
comes
back
you
must
be
the
fine
little
man
you
let
me
when
is
she
coming
back
i
am
not
sure
it
was
my
throbbing
hope
for
that
we
could
go
on
any
longer
without
her
was
simply
inconceivable
to
me
gradually
his
paroxysm
subsided
he
grew
quiescent
in
my
arms
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
as
we
nestled
against
each
other
in
silence
it
is
fortunate
that
the
grief
of
children
is
like
a
summer
shower
for
so
intense
is
it
while
it
lasts
that
any
serious
continuation
of
agony
would
rack
their
small
frames
to
pieces
all
right
uncle
ranny
he
murmured
finally
will
you
come
in
and
give
me
my
bath
go
and
run
know
how
first
the
hot
and
then
the
cold
and
put
the
ships
in
and
undress
then
you
come
in
and
tell
me
a
long
story
while
i
sail
them
and
he
ran
out
of
the
room
in
a
little
whirlwind
of
energy
i
sat
bowed
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
heavily
made
my
way
to
the
bathroom
is
the
queried
jimmie
with
an
intense
air
of
responsibility
his
erect
nude
little
figure
standing
with
a
ship
under
each
arm
like
a
symbol
of
man
adventuring
his
petty
argosies
on
this
planet
i
put
my
hand
judicially
into
the
water
how
important
is
the
temperature
of
a
bath
it
must
be
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
or
disastrous
results
might
follow
i
began
to
tell
him
an
ancient
story
of
an
island
that
proved
to
be
a
sleeping
whale
but
he
was
impatient
of
that
he
informed
me
in
deprecating
protest
tells
me
stories
of
mowgli
in
the
of
the
i
endeavored
with
a
heavy
heart
to
match
alicia
and
gradually
i
became
absorbed
in
my
task
and
in
jimmie
so
that
the
darkness
of
life
fell
away
from
me
the
water
splashed
and
the
ships
tacked
about
in
wild
maneuvers
while
jimmie
kept
reminding
me
that
he
was
listening
uncle
ranny
the
great
mystics
are
those
who
submerge
their
intellect
and
senses
into
night
so
that
their
souls
emerge
before
them
like
the
full
moon
out
of
the
blackness
every
parent
i
suppose
must
be
in
part
a
mystic
for
by
centering
his
heart
on
little
children
he
discerns
the
pulsating
irresistible
life
of
the
universe
the
past
and
the
future
alpha
and
omega
at
least
jimmie
was
courteous
enough
to
assure
me
when
he
hugged
me
for
the
last
time
with
sleepy
eyes
that
my
tale
was
but
oh
uncle
ranny
he
whispered
say
that
alicia
will
be
back
i
kissed
him
but
made
no
promise
in
the
dining
room
laura
and
randolph
were
sitting
over
their
books
grave
with
an
anxious
pucker
in
her
white
forehead
and
randolph
with
dilated
somewhat
fevered
eyes
he
was
obviously
thinking
rather
than
reading
but
i
dared
not
enter
into
any
more
discussion
of
absence
that
evening
only
now
after
many
days
can
i
write
down
the
events
of
the
day
following
my
last
entry
with
anything
approximating
composure
and
even
now
my
fingers
are
tremulous
as
they
hold
the
pencil
i
had
risen
early
for
my
sleep
had
been
broken
and
indeed
how
could
it
have
been
otherwise
i
was
parched
and
burning
within
to
act
to
do
something
to
range
the
city
the
god
i
thought
can
a
person
like
alicia
disappear
in
that
way
like
a
pebble
in
the
sea
but
my
frenzy
of
thought
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
burst
the
poor
narrow
limits
of
my
skull
produced
no
definite
idea
i
lashed
against
the
bars
of
the
brain
like
a
beast
in
its
cage
i
entertained
no
thought
of
going
to
the
office
that
morning
but
half
an
hour
after
i
was
up
that
was
the
only
thought
that
flooded
my
mind
there
are
blessings
in
a
routine
of
daily
labor
that
those
engaged
therein
can
hardly
understand
the
treadmill
i
imagine
leaves
the
mule
but
little
time
for
speculation
or
grief
or
any
other
emotions
i
was
that
rather
that
mule
let
could
find
oblivion
nowhere
better
than
in
the
treadmill
for
routine
can
dull
despair
it
was
still
half
an
hour
before
breakfast
when
my
nephew
randolph
came
clattering
down
the
stairs
meticulously
dressed
though
somewhat
he
gave
me
the
impression
of
badly
uncle
ranny
he
approached
me
are
you
going
to
the
office
this
morning
yes
i
think
i
am
why
randolph
like
to
go
in
to
town
with
go
around
what
do
you
mean
my
boy
somebody
ought
to
be
looking
for
alicia
all
the
you
think
so
uncle
ranny
like
to
try
and
he
looked
away
shamefaced
a
boy
in
his
sixteenth
year
can
be
a
considerable
pillar
in
a
household
i
had
somehow
overlooked
randolph
in
that
rôle
perhaps
i
had
been
inclined
to
treat
children
too
much
as
nestlings
all
wholly
dependent
upon
me
i
experienced
a
thrill
of
pleasurable
surprise
in
the
words
and
manner
he
had
said
no
word
concerning
his
father
had
asked
no
disconcerting
questions
he
merely
desired
to
help
but
of
course
there
is
somebody
looking
for
alicia
i
informed
him
yes
i
know
uncle
policeman
what
does
a
policeman
know
about
girls
like
alicia
talked
a
lot
she
and
i
he
stammered
i
have
a
hunch
i
could
sort
of
tell
what
of
doing
if
she
left
home
let
me
have
a
try
at
it
uncle
ranny
please
only
be
a
few
nickels
in
carfare
certainly
my
boy
i
put
my
arm
about
his
shoulders
to
frustrate
young
intentions
simply
because
they
are
young
has
never
appealed
to
me
as
wisdom
come
into
town
with
me
by
all
means
i
am
certain
alicia
will
come
back
could
not
know
the
effort
this
easy
answer
was
costing
but
there
is
no
reason
why
you
try
to
find
her
i
had
thrown
off
any
mask
of
secrecy
with
all
excepting
jimmie
insincerity
is
a
difficult
habit
to
wear
thanks
uncle
ranny
he
answered
with
suppressed
jubilation
and
for
the
first
time
in
our
common
history
i
suddenly
felt
that
i
had
a
companion
in
he
was
growing
up
when
he
left
me
at
the
station
charged
with
avuncular
instructions
that
he
was
to
telephone
me
at
various
times
of
the
day
and
that
he
was
to
lunch
with
me
if
he
could
i
had
a
tender
impulse
to
embrace
this
lad
before
all
the
concourse
but
i
knew
he
would
be
shamed
to
death
by
such
a
demonstration
so
i
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
we
parted
grinning
to
keep
each
other
in
heart
i
experienced
a
fleeting
intuition
that
alicia
would
be
restored
to
us
but
i
expected
nothing
at
all
from
romantic
quest
for
her
my
heart
went
out
to
the
boy
as
i
saw
him
merge
and
lose
himself
in
the
crowd
i
felt
very
tenderly
not
only
toward
those
of
my
flesh
but
to
all
young
things
facing
the
of
this
oddly
jumbled
sphere
i
was
becoming
an
ogler
in
my
old
age
every
young
girl
i
saw
in
the
streets
in
cars
at
crossings
i
scrutinized
searchingly
with
painful
leapings
of
the
heart
when
any
of
them
in
the
slightest
particular
resembled
alicia
and
the
melancholy
truth
came
to
me
that
you
can
build
a
life
to
any
design
you
please
but
only
a
miracle
will
keep
it
intact
visconti
was
in
the
office
when
i
arrived
and
he
was
kindness
itself
when
he
saw
my
face
mio
he
grasped
my
hand
something
serious
some
domestic
little
painful
i
stammered
and
he
saw
that
i
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
it
and
the
vast
loneliness
of
human
beings
traversing
their
orbits
on
earth
struck
me
as
i
sat
heavily
down
to
my
work
what
did
i
know
of
visconti
of
me
for
ages
i
had
worked
near
him
and
i
knew
he
trusted
and
had
what
is
called
regard
for
me
yet
the
planets
in
trackless
space
knew
more
of
each
other
i
believe
he
knows
that
i
am
a
bachelor
and
i
know
he
has
a
daughter
who
is
the
apple
of
his
he
pays
the
wage
by
which
i
live
but
what
else
did
we
know
he
had
lost
a
deeply
loved
wife
and
remained
a
widower
my
heart
warmed
to
him
in
a
sudden
sympathy
as
though
reciprocating
he
came
bustling
to
my
desk
a
minute
later
and
bending
toward
me
whispered
do
not
forget
that
your
time
is
your
your
not
forget
i
thanked
him
but
he
waved
his
pudgy
hand
in
sign
of
friendly
deprecation
of
formalities
com
duro
calle
lo
scendere
e
il
salir
per
scale
lamented
dante
yes
hard
is
the
path
the
going
up
and
down
other
stairs
when
you
depend
for
your
livelihood
upon
them
but
visconti
in
his
manner
endeavored
to
make
his
stairs
those
of
a
friend
there
was
no
word
from
randolph
that
morning
and
my
heart
grew
every
moment
heavier
i
seemed
to
require
no
food
i
straggled
aimlessly
during
the
noon
hour
through
mean
streets
from
bleecker
street
to
abingdon
square
in
a
world
of
listless
women
and
dirty
children
a
desert
ghostly
world
drab
and
wretched
shuttling
back
and
forth
all
but
inanimate
i
passed
minot
studio
but
with
sudden
horror
recoiled
from
entering
i
was
driven
about
like
a
leaf
i
was
a
shadow
in
a
world
of
shadows
towards
four
i
rose
heavily
from
my
desk
determined
to
drag
myself
to
police
headquarters
in
search
of
sergeant
cullum
i
expected
nothing
from
him
but
still
he
might
utter
a
word
of
hope
at
that
moment
my
telephone
rang
it
was
randolph
his
voice
was
charged
and
crackling
with
excitement
and
importance
will
you
meet
me
at
corner
street
and
the
avenue
right
away
why
i
said
tell
me
in
you
news
mean
a
swirl
of
hope
and
apprehension
swept
me
like
a
wave
and
left
me
gasping
yes
uncle
ranny
was
the
chuckling
reply
i
have
know
where
she
right
over
and
without
giving
me
a
chance
to
say
more
the
young
devil
hung
up
the
receiver
i
cursed
the
boy
in
my
heart
for
being
a
his
callousness
to
suffering
exactly
how
i
reached
that
corner
i
can
not
now
remember
i
did
not
walk
and
yet
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
recall
what
manner
of
conveyance
i
used
so
much
happened
in
my
mind
during
that
transit
that
external
matters
left
absolutely
no
impression
upon
it
the
first
impression
i
do
recall
is
the
shock
of
blank
chagrin
that
struck
me
like
a
shot
in
the
vitals
when
i
saw
randolph
standing
jauntily
alone
at
the
corner
staring
at
the
passing
crowd
alicia
was
not
with
him
yet
how
important
the
young
rascal
suddenly
seemed
in
my
eyes
he
alone
in
all
the
world
had
present
knowledge
of
her
i
could
have
fallen
upon
him
and
hugged
him
then
and
shamed
him
to
death
is
she
i
blurted
out
i
thought
me
in
name
and
i
seized
hold
of
him
fiercely
as
though
he
were
a
pickpocket
caught
in
the
act
he
glanced
at
me
with
humorous
cockiness
and
laughed
then
suddenly
conscious
that
people
were
staring
at
us
and
that
a
policeman
was
speculatively
watching
our
encounter
he
hastily
put
his
arm
through
mine
and
drew
me
away
come
on
uncle
ranny
lead
you
to
where
she
is
you
amazing
boy
i
muttered
but
are
you
really
sure
sure
sure
he
crowed
i
think
nothing
to
be
a
detective
i
believe
make
a
good
one
he
bragged
brag
you
young
devil
i
thought
indulgently
but
i
made
no
audible
reply
and
merely
made
him
walk
faster
he
was
leading
me
into
street
beyond
and
to
my
amazement
i
found
myself
at
the
door
of
bookshop
here
i
cried
in
stupefaction
he
nodded
grinning
as
though
he
expected
an
oration
of
praise
for
his
acumen
then
and
there
he
did
not
get
it
i
rushed
in
wildly
like
a
mad
man
into
those
silent
precincts
where
so
often
i
had
passed
blissfully
silent
hours
who
would
desire
a
garish
light
in
this
pleasant
temple
for
a
moment
i
seemed
to
be
in
utter
darkness
kind
of
dark
murmured
randolph
but
i
spotted
her
on
a
sudden
my
dilated
eyes
encountered
two
human
beings
simultaneously
in
their
line
of
vision
andrews
was
standing
in
dignity
in
the
middle
of
his
shop
like
a
monarch
about
to
receive
royalty
and
behind
him
at
a
desk
in
the
rear
a
girl
was
bending
over
some
writing
an
electric
light
illumining
her
fair
head
the
was
alicia
i
felt
the
effect
of
a
sharp
blow
over
the
heart
and
brushing
the
astonished
andrews
aside
i
made
a
crazy
leap
toward
her
why
randolph
byrd
began
andrews
seen
alicia
i
cried
out
in
what
sounded
even
in
my
own
ears
like
a
sob
oh
uncle
ranny
she
jumped
from
her
chair
with
a
little
scream
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
pressing
her
to
my
heart
with
a
quivering
convulsive
joy
that
choked
all
utterance
she
gasped
in
pain
the
poor
child
but
when
my
arms
relaxed
she
lay
sobbing
happily
against
my
heart
randolph
was
so
scandalized
that
he
sullenly
turned
his
back
upon
us
andrews
was
watching
us
with
discreet
and
sober
interest
my
dearest
child
i
whispered
still
in
a
sort
of
trance
of
ecstasy
and
alicia
with
the
tears
trickling
down
her
face
murmured
softly
oh
how
glad
i
am
found
and
randolph
she
added
with
a
happy
laugh
her
last
words
suddenly
woke
me
out
of
my
trance
i
loosed
my
arms
and
stood
for
an
instant
baffled
uncertain
shamefaced
what
are
you
doing
here
i
then
brusquely
demanded
with
stupid
severity
to
conceal
the
turbulent
emotions
within
me
you
get
my
letter
she
faltered
i
tried
to
had
nowhere
to
her
lips
were
he
told
me
what
a
burden
i
seemed
to
be
only
making
a
lot
of
i
had
nowhere
to
go
she
wept
he
who
andrews
i
demanded
harshly
no
no
pendleton
she
was
sobbing
again
ah
of
course
pendleton
i
felt
myself
turning
livid
with
hate
for
the
man
whose
purpose
in
life
seemed
to
be
to
wreck
my
own
and
did
andrews
know
you
were
ward
oh
no
uncle
ranny
and
her
voice
was
like
a
tired
of
crying
i
meant
to
tell
him
i
told
you
he
just
took
me
glancing
now
toward
andrews
i
found
him
discreetly
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
his
shop
but
somehow
he
had
managed
to
draw
my
scandalized
nephew
into
conversation
to
afford
me
the
courtesy
of
a
greater
privacy
my
heart
went
out
to
him
in
affection
as
never
before
andrews
i
called
pulling
myself
together
to
a
semblance
of
dignity
andrews
gave
a
nod
to
randolph
and
without
any
unseemly
haste
approached
me
pleasantly
smiling
this
is
my
alicia
palmer
i
managed
to
say
with
forced
calmness
andrews
bowed
ceremoniously
as
though
he
were
meeting
the
owner
of
the
huth
library
or
bernard
quaritch
yet
there
was
a
curious
twinkle
in
his
shrewd
old
scotch
eyes
like
all
young
women
of
the
present
day
i
went
on
with
astonishing
is
at
its
best
when
a
man
is
lying
for
a
she
wanted
to
prove
her
independence
by
scorning
my
poor
protection
earn
her
own
understand
andrews
said
andrews
and
she
can
earn
it
too
now
i
understand
the
mystery
she
recognized
a
second
edition
of
at
a
glance
your
training
salary
is
advanced
miss
palmer
alicia
smiled
blushing
faintly
and
in
that
smile
i
suddenly
realized
how
much
of
the
child
still
clung
to
this
young
much
of
the
child
no
doubt
remains
clinging
to
every
woman
she
was
pained
distraught
suffering
yet
she
seemed
to
feel
that
she
had
done
something
very
courageous
and
dignified
and
it
was
to
her
dignity
i
hung
on
with
tenacity
for
instinctively
i
recognized
that
this
was
a
turning
point
in
her
the
woman
was
now
putting
away
the
child
in
the
cradle
of
the
past
i
think
i
shall
ask
you
to
release
her
andrews
i
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
some
day
i
shall
explain
to
you
more
fully
never
mind
that
i
should
like
to
take
my
ward
your
permission
certainly
certainly
he
affirmed
with
spontaneous
vehemence
but
come
in
soon
both
of
of
our
stripe
loves
the
good
things
in
both
i
expect
to
have
some
new
things
from
professor
library
delight
you
we
shall
indeed
my
dear
andrews
get
your
hat
alicia
and
as
she
turned
away
for
her
things
i
managed
to
murmur
this
much
to
the
kindly
andrews
i
shall
never
forget
your
conduct
in
this
matter
a
great
bookseller
but
man
dear
even
a
greater
gentleman
and
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
we
left
the
shop
a
spate
of
questions
boiled
in
my
brain
and
foamed
up
like
turbulent
waters
backed
by
a
dam
but
all
at
once
i
came
to
a
sharp
decision
i
knew
enough
it
was
that
devil
pendleton
that
had
filled
her
mind
with
the
thought
that
she
was
a
burden
until
the
poor
child
was
wild
with
a
frenzy
of
distraction
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
trust
to
his
persuasions
then
there
was
the
scene
of
that
dreadful
evening
when
in
her
bewilderment
she
realized
herself
as
an
apple
of
discord
a
shatterer
of
families
i
believed
i
understood
enough
where
did
you
sleep
alicia
i
asked
her
nonchalantly
i
have
a
little
room
in
street
she
answered
simply
i
paid
for
it
yet
the
landlady
wanted
money
in
advance
but
i
told
her
i
have
it
so
she
let
me
stay
anyway
let
us
go
there
my
dear
and
settle
it
now
yes
uncle
ranny
she
murmured
low
got
to
hand
it
to
you
broke
out
randolph
emerging
from
his
silence
a
true
a
girl
whereat
we
all
burst
into
happy
laughter
and
for
the
rest
of
our
peregrinations
as
well
as
in
the
train
the
lad
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
alicia
in
sheer
amazed
admiration
it
was
as
though
he
were
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
had
i
time
to
speculate
philosophically
i
could
expend
much
of
it
in
wondering
why
pure
joy
can
not
be
recorded
perhaps
because
we
experience
so
little
of
it
of
sorrow
and
tribulation
we
strange
creatures
that
are
men
can
give
a
pretty
fair
account
from
job
down
we
have
excelled
in
it
but
before
sheer
joy
we
are
dumb
i
can
only
repeat
to
myself
the
poor
colorless
words
that
i
am
happy
happy
happy
as
the
day
is
short
for
one
brief
space
of
reaction
after
finding
alicia
the
senses
reeled
the
worn
body
and
mind
swooned
into
a
sort
of
deliquescence
of
lassitude
the
eyes
smarted
with
unshed
meaningless
moisture
the
overdriven
heart
throbbed
with
a
vast
supernal
relief
coextensive
with
the
universe
then
swiftly
with
an
almost
audible
sound
that
unnerved
brain
slid
into
its
customary
shape
of
health
more
wholesomely
joyous
than
ever
before
and
all
the
world
was
bathed
in
freshness
the
blue
of
the
sky
was
fairer
the
sunlight
purer
and
even
the
poor
suburban
grass
of
crestlands
autumnally
waning
glistened
with
the
verdure
and
brightness
of
a
new
creation
but
who
can
describe
happiness
pendleton
is
gone
children
are
here
no
eight
words
in
the
language
of
shakespeare
and
milton
have
ever
breathed
to
me
the
same
meaning
as
those
eight
words
yet
what
do
they
signify
on
paper
all
europe
is
in
a
turmoil
and
the
germans
have
all
but
taken
paris
yet
this
i
perceive
is
my
first
mention
of
a
vast
catastrophe
what
tiny
creatures
are
men
people
are
dying
and
suffering
by
the
thousands
yet
we
cisatlantians
scan
the
headlines
and
pursue
our
own
ends
in
the
accustomed
way
what
though
half
the
planet
is
in
have
reconquered
my
home
why
i
wonder
had
i
ever
imagined
myself
to
have
a
horror
of
home
a
home
is
a
little
island
of
personal
love
in
the
vast
impersonal
chaos
of
pity
him
or
her
who
never
lands
upon
that
island
of
nights
occasionally
i
now
indulge
myself
in
a
fire
on
the
hearth
the
wood
that
burns
brightest
i
note
leaves
only
a
little
heap
of
white
ashes
when
my
eyes
rest
upon
alicia
or
i
see
the
children
flitting
about
or
hear
their
ringing
voices
through
the
house
i
experience
a
wonderful
contentment
that
i
am
the
fire
at
which
they
may
warm
their
hands
i
who
once
entertained
fantastic
visions
of
future
greatness
of
name
and
fame
now
feel
content
to
become
a
little
heap
of
white
ashes
sergeant
cullum
excellent
man
journeyed
out
here
two
days
after
i
had
found
alicia
a
day
after
the
legal
ceremony
of
adoption
to
apprise
me
that
he
believed
my
ward
to
be
in
baltimore
i
was
about
to
burst
into
uncontrollable
laughter
but
my
conscience
smote
me
and
i
was
ashamed
in
my
vast
relief
i
had
wholly
and
selfishly
forgotten
this
good
man
who
was
still
upon
the
quest
what
power
of
divination
or
answer
to
prayer
had
directed
his
thoughts
to
baltimore
i
can
not
imagine
but
with
my
contrite
apology
and
thanks
went
a
gift
that
i
trust
has
soothed
his
ruffled
feelings
we
parted
in
friendship
oh
excellent
thaumaturgic
policeman
randolph
burst
into
a
loud
sniffing
laugh
when
i
told
him
and
alicia
of
sergeant
visit
and
the
baltimore
clew
oh
cops
are
idiots
he
chuckled
arrogantly
and
looked
toward
alicia
with
a
haughty
proprietorial
air
they
know
take
me
long
to
dope
out
where
to
look
for
he
boasted
i
figured
it
out
like
this
is
bugs
on
your
old
books
she
was
looking
for
a
job
to
earn
her
own
living
she
alicia
bent
her
head
still
shamefaced
over
the
episode
i
do
strong
on
engines
i
go
to
a
place
where
they
make
or
sell
engines
well
with
her
it
was
books
i
went
around
to
some
book
then
suddenly
i
had
a
hunch
you
and
she
always
jaw
about
i
looked
him
up
in
the
book
sure
enough
when
i
went
round
and
peeped
in
through
the
door
i
saw
alicia
upon
a
ladder
handling
some
of
those
old
books
there
i
thought
go
in
and
call
her
down
but
then
i
thought
would
surprise
her
more
if
you
and
i
came
in
on
her
i
beat
it
to
a
cops
say
so
it
sounds
good
and
again
his
glance
wholly
appropriated
alicia
the
youngster
seems
to
think
he
invented
her
but
i
am
full
of
gratitude
to
that
boy
the
closure
of
the
stock
exchange
and
the
abrupt
slowing
up
of
financial
business
has
filtered
like
a
shadow
even
into
and
is
giving
me
some
unhurried
hours
in
which
to
ponder
the
future
how
many
bachelors
i
wonder
have
conjured
similar
visions
constructed
the
same
castles
of
thin
air
to
educate
alicia
to
serve
and
to
love
her
until
my
love
surrounds
her
so
that
she
can
not
choose
but
return
create
a
woman
out
of
this
very
sweet
could
be
more
blissful
alicia
is
now
in
her
teens
but
suppose
she
were
could
she
ever
think
with
anything
but
filial
affection
of
a
man
nearly
twice
her
age
who
stands
to
her
in
like
a
lovesick
boy
who
pulls
at
the
faint
intimations
of
his
mustache
and
searches
the
newspaper
for
cases
of
marriage
at
seventeen
i
eagerly
scan
the
prints
and
cudgel
my
memory
for
such
unions
as
ours
would
be
but
the
papers
are
filled
with
war
and
rumors
of
war
it
comes
to
me
suddenly
that
a
certain
aged
senator
has
not
so
long
ago
married
his
ward
under
even
a
greater
disparity
of
i
am
absurdly
happy
i
see
myself
with
alicia
matured
and
radiant
ever
a
life
of
bright
serenity
calling
endearing
names
did
i
hear
it
half
in
a
doze
long
since
i
know
not
where
did
i
dream
it
an
hour
ago
when
asleep
in
this
but
this
is
folly
tennyson
is
out
of
fashion
and
there
are
greater
fools
than
old
fools
i
ask
too
much
of
the
high
gods
enough
has
already
been
given
to
a
crusty
bookworm
like
me
suppose
i
had
married
gertrude
the
voices
would
never
have
made
music
for
my
ears
nevertheless
alicia
shall
have
the
best
education
i
can
give
her
visconti
must
be
aging
i
fear
for
he
has
taken
to
repeating
himself
he
has
told
me
often
before
that
his
daughter
gina
is
the
apple
of
his
eye
but
during
these
somewhat
listless
days
in
the
office
in
which
extras
figure
largely
and
strategy
is
the
one
indoor
game
he
has
been
going
into
more
detail
i
dined
at
his
house
last
night
and
he
asked
me
again
to
dine
on
saturday
i
dislike
refusing
him
and
i
like
lying
less
but
i
declined
on
the
plea
of
an
engagement
i
always
forget
he
returned
with
a
laugh
that
a
young
man
is
not
of
a
widower
like
a
young
man
in
short
has
engagements
i
made
some
sort
of
deprecating
noise
he
talks
as
though
i
were
and
i
like
him
for
it
but
you
see
he
went
on
explaining
it
is
like
this
gina
the
bambina
is
the
apple
of
my
eye
and
she
must
do
you
call
made
gay
see
i
signified
my
clairvoyance
she
is
of
nineteen
she
must
have
not
so
he
is
fond
of
the
socratic
method
and
i
humored
him
but
she
go
to
she
no
girl
friends
ah
but
a
is
young
men
in
the
house
that
amuse
her
eh
and
he
slapped
me
on
the
back
and
roared
with
laughter
of
a
boisterous
heartiness
that
somewhat
as
novelists
say
took
me
aback
i
have
not
exactly
been
seeing
myself
in
the
guise
of
a
youth
cut
out
to
amuse
gina
visconti
how
of
sunday
he
asked
with
a
sudden
quizzical
soberness
sunday
you
can
come
i
regretted
his
insistence
but
somewhat
laboredly
i
explained
that
i
am
weakly
addicted
to
books
and
that
sunday
was
the
single
day
when
i
could
sit
among
my
books
ah
but
of
course
gravely
he
understood
full
well
that
i
was
a
student
a
scholar
who
outside
office
hours
pursued
a
higher
life
and
so
forth
i
felt
mawkish
and
mean
but
i
clung
to
my
sunday
monday
we
call
it
monday
he
pressed
i
could
not
be
so
churlish
as
to
decline
further
but
i
hardly
knew
why
a
sense
of
uneasiness
stole
into
my
bosom
after
his
subsequent
words
the
he
went
on
thoughtfully
vehement
she
is
all
i
in
the
world
at
my
death
she
shall
possess
everything
i
have
she
has
it
now
for
whom
then
do
i
work
if
not
for
gina
as
for
me
i
could
go
back
to
i
have
enough
but
is
american
and
he
kissed
his
finger
tips
with
unction
she
is
fine
american
girl
having
said
that
he
veered
into
talk
about
belgium
von
kluck
and
general
strategy
but
why
should
he
so
persistently
sing
the
praises
and
prospects
of
his
daughter
to
me
a
clerk
in
his
office
i
had
a
sudden
impulse
to
go
to
him
and
unbosom
myself
on
the
score
of
my
own
and
my
own
aspirations
for
somehow
i
could
not
that
is
an
island
girdled
not
only
by
ordinary
reticence
which
is
with
me
a
vice
but
by
a
host
of
emotions
like
those
flames
that
circled
the
sleeping
goddess
i
am
not
a
latin
i
can
not
bubble
forth
my
inmost
hopes
or
flaunt
my
heart
upon
my
sleeve
sunday
a
wonderful
walk
with
alicia
through
the
already
waning
woods
of
westchester
there
has
been
a
certain
air
of
gravity
overhanging
her
of
contrition
perhaps
that
stabbed
with
pain
i
realized
then
to
what
degree
her
blithe
spirit
and
the
starry
laughter
of
her
eyes
had
been
the
wine
of
my
recent
life
i
could
not
tolerate
her
seeming
depression
besides
there
was
the
matter
of
her
education
to
be
discussed
jimmie
clamored
to
go
with
us
but
this
time
even
his
privileged
position
did
not
avail
him
i
desired
to
be
alone
with
alicia
was
it
my
mood
i
wonder
or
do
the
woods
in
reality
begin
to
whisper
a
farewell
in
the
decline
of
the
year
every
tree
even
to
the
youngest
sapling
seemed
to
nod
to
us
as
we
walked
and
to
rustle
a
murmur
like
the
leavetaking
of
a
pilgrim
bent
on
a
lengthy
journey
i
have
ever
been
impatient
of
reading
descriptions
of
nature
and
have
chimed
with
the
scoffers
at
the
pathetic
fallacy
nevertheless
i
can
bemuse
myself
for
hours
listening
to
the
wind
among
the
tree
tops
or
gazing
at
the
haze
upon
the
hills
and
in
a
slow
measured
rhythm
as
if
having
endless
time
before
them
they
invariably
spell
a
message
message
infinitely
sad
but
for
the
creative
laughing
sun
that
rides
triumphant
high
over
all
come
alicia
i
broke
out
brusquely
joining
the
sun
in
his
laughter
we
have
some
bright
things
to
talk
over
let
us
allow
the
woods
to
lull
us
they
are
going
to
sleep
we
are
not
here
you
are
ready
for
college
that
she
emerged
from
her
reverie
as
a
person
shaken
from
a
drowse
and
smiled
with
a
distant
look
in
her
eyes
bright
things
she
murmured
pensively
everything
that
has
happened
to
me
since
i
came
to
you
has
been
bright
and
everything
what
makes
it
so
hard
uncle
have
been
so
useless
what
good
am
i
i
laughed
uproariously
enough
to
make
the
woods
shake
did
alicia
know
how
much
i
enjoyed
combating
such
statements
or
did
she
really
mean
it
you
have
i
wanted
to
tell
her
banteringly
that
she
had
been
a
burden
and
a
drag
upon
my
household
a
weight
not
to
be
i
perceived
that
she
was
more
than
serious
she
was
sad
now
you
are
of
course
talking
nonsense
i
answered
flatly
but
there
is
college
before
you
that
ought
to
cure
all
that
perhaps
a
little
morbid
bright
associations
will
change
that
but
how
she
protested
can
you
talk
of
sending
me
to
all
the
expense
and
i
so
worthless
we
discuss
that
my
child
i
broke
in
the
expense
had
indeed
occupied
my
i
had
formed
a
plan
for
that
tell
me
what
you
would
like
best
to
be
the
trouble
uncle
ranny
she
replied
pathetically
what
can
i
be
i
might
work
for
mr
andrews
modern
girls
i
informed
her
judging
by
our
fiction
invariably
develop
literary
dramatic
or
histrionic
talent
she
must
act
write
fiction
or
preferably
plays
journalism
and
settlement
work
are
no
longer
fashionable
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
they
turn
militant
suffragists
but
even
that
is
on
the
wane
but
the
two
careers
are
not
incompatible
you
feel
the
urge
in
your
young
bones
which
of
the
arts
is
it
that
is
calling
you
the
pen
the
stage
speak
this
is
the
critical
hour
she
detected
raillery
in
my
voice
and
laughed
softly
i
know
you
are
making
fun
of
me
uncle
ranny
she
said
but
not
of
me
alone
all
the
same
i
wish
i
did
have
some
talent
but
oh
i
know
i
uncle
ranny
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
you
what
and
without
finishing
her
sentence
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
i
noted
that
her
neck
was
suffused
with
a
deep
blush
but
you
must
tell
me
my
dear
i
gently
took
her
hands
from
her
face
i
just
become
your
parent
and
guardian
by
ironclad
legal
adoption
and
a
terribly
stern
parent
and
guardian
i
no
mistake
about
that
well
she
gazed
downward
shamefacedly
still
exquisitely
blushing
i
suppose
i
must
then
sometimes
i
think
uncle
ranny
she
went
on
with
deliberate
firmness
that
there
is
one
thing
girls
always
think
of
but
never
talk
is
more
important
than
any
of
the
others
oh
i
suppose
i
am
terribly
improper
and
immodest
but
if
i
am
know
any
have
to
forgive
me
but
oh
i
come
some
day
make
a
home
to
bring
up
children
wonderful
than
anything
else
made
me
say
it
uncle
ranny
she
turned
away
with
tears
of
i
suppose
i
am
made
me
tell
you
and
i
told
you
a
girl
study
to
for
anything
else
and
still
tormented
by
her
brazen
immodesty
she
plucked
yellowing
leaves
agitatedly
and
scattered
them
to
the
winnowing
breeze
as
she
was
turned
from
me
she
could
not
have
seen
my
arms
going
out
suddenly
as
if
to
take
her
and
then
falling
again
to
my
sides
i
longed
to
embrace
her
and
to
crown
her
with
all
the
glory
of
womanhood
but
my
conscience
warned
me
away
in
my
heart
however
happiness
leaped
up
like
the
lark
i
have
never
seen
and
warbled
joyously
a
divine
melody
that
i
had
never
heard
it
required
courage
for
alicia
a
young
girl
to
confess
what
she
had
confessed
and
courage
joined
to
all
the
other
qualities
i
knew
her
possessed
of
must
produce
the
best
that
is
in
womanhood
it
is
a
commentary
on
our
times
that
alicia
a
girl
ready
for
college
was
ashamed
of
what
she
had
told
me
i
was
a
fool
to
press
her
further
i
suppose
but
then
and
there
i
determined
to
be
at
least
as
brave
as
was
alicia
have
you
i
asked
hoping
my
voice
was
not
shaking
have
you
already
some
one
in
mind
she
shook
her
head
vehemently
still
plucking
at
the
leaves
i
could
not
repress
a
profound
sigh
what
does
he
look
like
in
your
eye
alicia
what
is
your
vision
of
him
i
knew
i
was
courting
pain
but
there
are
moments
when
even
torture
is
irresistible
i
hope
he
will
be
manly
she
murmured
as
if
to
and
have
at
least
some
of
uncle
ranny
every
attribute
of
that
hypothetical
he
was
a
reproach
to
my
blow
at
my
peculiar
weaknesses
but
i
had
invited
it
the
ideal
of
a
girl
never
errs
it
is
her
emotions
that
may
lead
her
astray
oh
credited
me
with
some
goodness
few
are
the
women
however
who
choose
a
man
for
his
goodness
in
my
quality
of
uncle
ranny
i
was
good
i
stood
for
a
moment
in
silence
writhing
with
anguish
alternately
conjuring
up
and
banishing
the
hatefully
magnificent
creature
of
dreams
but
at
last
i
gripped
my
soul
with
sudden
resolution
now
at
least
she
was
mine
and
i
must
accustom
myself
to
the
idea
of
her
being
some
one
at
the
earliest
the
inevitable
renunciation
she
had
innocently
and
adorably
honored
me
with
her
greatest
confidence
for
the
present
at
least
i
must
make
the
most
of
my
little
happiness
come
dear
i
gently
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
you
have
told
me
what
i
wanted
to
know
i
put
her
hand
through
my
arm
and
we
strolled
on
slowly
we
are
horrible
old
fogies
alicia
and
we
tell
a
soul
about
our
we
should
be
ostracized
and
possibly
jailed
but
nothing
you
could
have
said
would
have
made
me
happier
than
what
you
have
just
told
me
i
know
of
no
greater
career
than
the
one
you
have
chosen
and
college
much
or
little
as
you
like
of
it
can
serve
you
for
a
finer
womanhood
no
less
than
it
can
for
anything
else
in
fact
more
i
think
from
still
swimming
eyes
she
gave
me
a
sidelong
glance
mingled
so
much
of
gratitude
shame
and
pride
that
i
laughed
aloud
there
is
one
thing
got
to
make
up
your
mind
to
alicia
i
drew
her
close
to
my
side
you
must
come
and
tell
me
everything
on
your
mind
without
repression
forget
my
dear
that
i
am
your
father
mother
and
most
intimate
friends
think
how
sorry
we
should
both
have
been
if
you
had
suppressed
and
hidden
what
you
have
told
me
yes
uncle
ranny
she
breathed
and
very
sweetly
in
a
way
to
melt
the
heart
of
a
man
she
lifted
my
hand
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
i
was
irreparably
uncle
ranny
i
dared
not
make
a
movement
in
return
at
that
moment
i
might
have
betrayed
more
than
ever
again
i
could
hide
but
the
woods
were
now
of
another
hue
the
invisible
lark
was
still
singing
albeit
a
sadder
strain
we
decided
that
alicia
is
to
enter
barnard
next
week
and
commute
with
me
on
the
daily
train
dear
god
how
i
cry
out
for
peace
and
there
is
no
peace
who
would
have
looked
for
disaster
at
the
plump
hands
of
gina
visconti
yet
as
though
she
had
willfully
shut
the
door
of
my
livelihood
in
my
face
that
innocent
girl
has
abruptly
cut
me
off
i
can
not
go
back
to
that
accursed
dinner
which
instinct
made
me
shun
was
the
cause
and
occasion
of
it
all
i
had
begun
foolishly
to
feel
myself
at
home
in
the
visconti
household
when
the
housemaid
informed
me
that
the
would
be
down
directly
i
strolled
into
the
leisurely
not
in
the
least
surprised
that
i
was
apparently
the
only
guest
and
gazed
again
at
the
shining
new
furniture
costly
and
glistening
for
the
time
wondering
how
it
continued
to
stay
so
new
there
is
a
scattering
of
saccharine
pictures
on
the
walls
that
invariably
make
me
smile
cherry
ripe
the
old
oaken
bucket
sweet
sixteen
a
glittering
small
marble
of
cupid
and
psyche
and
a
crayon
enlargement
of
the
very
stout
lady
that
was
mother
why
i
wondered
do
not
modern
italians
stick
to
their
own
old
masters
i
once
bought
a
very
fair
copy
of
pope
julian
ii
in
florence
for
fifty
lire
even
energetic
modernism
however
seemed
unable
to
exorcise
the
peculiar
airless
odor
of
an
due
largely
i
suppose
to
hermetically
sealed
windows
and
constantly
lowered
shades
gina
came
down
directly
as
had
been
promised
in
a
very
pretty
satin
evening
frock
that
struck
me
as
too
light
for
a
girl
as
as
she
that
is
a
detail
however
which
was
superseded
in
my
mind
by
the
query
as
to
why
she
should
feel
it
necessary
to
romp
into
a
room
rather
than
walk
but
i
know
she
aspires
to
be
her
greeting
is
always
warm
and
her
energy
was
the
one
touch
of
ozone
in
that
stuffy
a
moment
later
entered
her
father
his
face
pardonably
gleaming
like
a
moon
through
the
haze
at
the
charms
of
his
only
daughter
for
gina
is
not
only
is
eminently
modish
to
the
last
wave
of
her
rich
black
hair
is
she
a
fine
american
is
she
not
eh
look
seems
to
challenge
all
present
the
dinner
was
more
than
usually
exuberant
with
a
wealth
of
champagne
for
so
small
a
company
and
hothouse
grapes
indeed
the
exuberance
itself
seemed
of
the
hothouse
variety
we
jested
we
laughed
at
nothing
we
were
gay
as
old
friends
at
a
reunion
at
the
i
am
always
foolishly
like
that
lady
who
could
not
long
abstain
from
referring
to
missolonghi
somehow
i
find
myself
caressingly
touching
the
subjects
of
dante
or
petrarch
or
even
leopardi
and
invariably
gina
caroms
against
me
with
a
thrilling
cabaret
a
new
dance
or
the
latest
show
i
am
nowhere
after
the
coffee
visconti
whose
mind
seemed
preoccupied
rose
abruptly
and
with
one
of
his
gleaming
smiles
left
us
on
the
hackneyed
plea
of
letters
to
be
written
gina
was
restless
for
a
minute
or
two
after
her
departure
she
walked
over
to
the
piano
struck
a
chord
standing
then
suddenly
sheered
to
the
phonograph
and
asked
would
i
dance
if
she
turned
on
a
lovely
fox
trot
apologetically
i
was
compelled
to
inform
her
that
the
fox
trot
was
as
foreign
to
my
accomplishments
as
an
act
on
the
trapeze
i
know
you
could
learn
to
be
a
lovely
dancer
said
gina
she
then
sat
down
beside
me
on
the
expensive
tapestry
davenport
with
one
foot
under
her
and
one
ankle
to
the
wide
world
and
leaned
forward
on
her
elbows
so
that
the
slender
shoulder
straps
of
her
frock
pressed
upward
four
little
mounds
of
pink
flesh
toward
her
ears
she
has
very
pretty
ears
has
gina
a
very
engaging
child
i
thought
holding
this
soulful
attitude
gina
queried
softly
you
love
the
movies
yes
i
said
what
have
you
seen
lately
she
pursued
i
have
only
seen
was
a
series
of
pictures
of
the
south
sea
islands
you
mean
never
seen
any
others
afraid
not
oh
she
gasped
loved
the
movies
since
i
was
that
high
she
pointed
to
a
somewhat
excessively
oily
portrait
of
herself
painted
at
about
the
age
of
ten
or
eleven
i
believe
in
having
a
lively
time
she
ran
on
when
i
was
in
public
school
some
of
them
called
me
the
guinea
i
cried
i
made
up
my
mind
i
going
to
be
a
i
was
going
to
be
an
american
i
as
good
as
any
of
them
she
demanded
passionately
what
was
the
matter
with
me
then
i
found
out
what
was
the
matter
with
girls
are
always
having
good
times
so
i
thought
have
as
good
a
time
as
anybody
i
cried
until
my
father
let
me
go
to
the
movies
nearly
every
afternoon
and
twice
on
saturday
and
i
always
treated
some
other
american
a
ticket
to
go
with
me
they
were
friendly
then
you
can
bet
they
stopped
calling
me
a
guinea
girl
gina
could
not
possibly
know
how
pathetic
that
sounded
to
me
the
curious
savagery
of
children
toward
those
alien
of
race
i
reflected
is
one
of
the
last
survivals
of
the
tribal
state
of
mankind
the
somewhat
overpowering
scent
she
used
struck
me
as
a
survival
also
though
i
could
not
remember
of
what
there
is
my
cousin
name
is
really
gemma
girl
warmed
to
her
she
tried
to
be
american
too
but
she
gave
it
up
when
i
went
to
finishing
school
in
darien
she
was
already
married
four
years
been
married
and
has
three
children
now
the
use
of
that
she
have
a
good
time
now
hardly
ever
goes
out
and
her
quite
well
off
too
a
contractor
but
an
thinks
the
right
way
for
a
girl
to
live
and
she
shuddered
slightly
going
to
marry
an
american
a
fierce
light
of
resolution
leaped
to
her
liquid
dark
eyes
and
i
own
i
felt
terrified
you
young
to
think
of
marriage
i
murmured
lamely
young
repeated
gina
in
surprise
been
thinking
about
the
kind
of
man
going
to
marry
since
i
was
thirteen
years
old
obviously
that
was
one
subject
she
had
given
mature
reflection
you
she
demanded
no
i
laughed
not
as
young
as
that
do
you
like
italian
girls
she
leaned
toward
me
abruptly
wistfully
yes
indeed
i
answered
her
laughing
there
is
even
fornarina
must
have
oh
i
mean
those
she
cried
flushing
excitedly
i
mean
love
american
men
the
man
going
to
marry
like
you
i
like
simplicity
and
disingenuousness
in
the
in
the
old
for
that
her
attitude
was
now
unconventional
with
her
large
ankle
rocking
to
and
fro
and
her
bosom
as
she
leaned
forward
almost
touching
my
shirt
i
feared
her
father
might
be
displeased
were
he
to
enter
the
room
suddenly
the
scent
moreover
was
clouding
my
wits
with
my
hand
to
my
forehead
i
rose
ponderously
let
me
i
mused
with
heavy
facetiousness
as
though
cogitating
a
deep
problem
do
i
like
them
i
walked
a
step
or
two
and
faced
her
you
are
the
only
one
i
i
certainly
like
you
i
added
mildly
she
uncoiled
herself
rose
up
swiftly
and
took
a
step
in
my
direction
on
a
sudden
she
stumbled
gave
a
little
cry
and
pitched
forward
so
that
i
barely
had
time
to
catch
her
did
you
turn
your
ankle
she
gasped
and
lay
for
a
moment
in
my
arms
breathing
heavily
her
bosom
pressing
against
mine
let
me
lead
i
began
all
right
she
whispered
thickly
just
let
me
rest
a
minute
and
then
that
astonishing
girl
suddenly
lifted
up
her
hand
passed
it
lightly
over
my
head
and
murmured
that
she
loved
the
color
of
my
hair
light
brown
she
explained
not
pitch
black
like
mine
and
then
she
rested
her
head
lightly
on
my
shoulder
and
i
love
your
so
let
me
lead
you
i
murmured
as
though
i
were
the
helpless
one
i
suddenly
heard
the
voice
of
visconti
laughing
behind
me
and
hand
clutched
my
shoulder
convulsively
i
confess
that
at
my
heart
was
a
clutch
of
sheer
blue
funk
she
has
just
turned
her
ankle
i
exclaimed
mechanically
all
right
papa
put
in
cheerful
voice
these
old
slippers
go
and
change
them
and
to
my
amazement
she
straightened
up
flashed
a
radiant
smile
at
both
of
us
and
walked
to
the
door
with
only
the
slightest
of
limps
sure
you
can
walk
alone
i
managed
to
stammer
oh
yes
gina
waved
her
hand
at
the
door
be
down
soon
the
father
laughed
loudly
and
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
come
let
us
have
a
little
smoke
i
followed
him
dazedly
wonderful
girl
gina
he
exclaimed
high
spirits
eh
high
i
felt
as
though
i
had
emerged
from
a
severe
physical
struggle
i
can
even
an
old
man
like
me
can
see
he
chuckled
jovially
as
he
held
his
cigar
box
toward
me
in
the
smoking
room
that
you
young
people
like
each
oh
sit
down
sit
down
it
is
all
right
i
must
get
used
to
the
idea
of
the
bambino
being
grown
up
and
forcing
me
down
into
a
leather
chair
he
continued
to
tap
my
shoulder
by
way
of
emphasizing
his
words
i
have
been
i
trust
me
my
boy
you
can
not
do
better
is
one
treasure
for
a
man
no
love
like
the
italian
love
she
will
make
you
the
but
sake
visconti
wait
i
cried
in
agony
leaping
from
my
chair
i
even
pretend
to
think
of
such
a
thing
gina
is
far
say
no
more
he
interrupted
vehemently
tapping
me
with
the
back
of
his
hand
on
the
chest
you
are
a
fine
gooda
young
man
thanks
i
gasped
but
you
understand
i
am
in
no
position
to
marry
any
woman
at
this
time
hold
on
he
flung
me
back
into
the
chair
with
an
exuberant
force
that
would
have
made
me
laugh
if
my
vitals
had
not
been
chilled
by
terror
is
it
that
i
do
not
know
do
i
not
know
how
your
capital
did
like
that
but
all
that
i
has
it
she
will
have
enough
and
he
nodded
his
head
with
pregnant
emphasis
enough
my
friend
and
will
be
my
son
he
struck
his
large
chest
a
mighty
blow
and
threw
back
his
head
with
triumphant
finality
i
attempted
no
more
to
rise
it
was
useless
signor
visconti
i
began
huskily
you
do
not
understand
me
i
can
not
marry
anybody
ever
i
have
four
children
to
bring
be
responsible
for
the
youngest
of
them
is
eight
honor
me
greatly
by
your
marriage
is
not
for
me
he
stared
in
speechless
stupefaction
at
me
as
though
i
had
revealed
some
incredible
horror
to
his
eyes
four
children
he
whispered
with
dilated
eyes
but
i
thought
you
have
never
been
married
i
have
not
i
replied
with
an
intense
relief
that
was
like
a
restorative
then
catching
his
meaning
glance
i
went
on
hastily
they
are
my
orphans
i
am
responsible
for
them
they
have
no
one
else
ah
he
drew
in
his
breath
with
the
sound
of
a
syphon
that
is
it
is
it
yes
i
murmured
rising
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
this
ghastly
episode
now
if
you
will
excuse
all
at
once
his
hands
shot
out
and
clutched
both
of
mine
not
good
man
he
shouted
vehemently
only
a
great
man
i
never
make
and
before
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
had
embraced
me
in
continental
fashion
and
large
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
the
cup
of
my
torment
was
complete
a
mad
desire
to
get
away
possessed
to
get
away
i
stirred
to
move
but
he
held
me
resolutely
we
will
think
it
out
my
friend
he
announced
with
sober
energy
we
will
talk
it
it
out
i
too
am
a
man
with
a
heart
it
is
i
who
i
not
lost
my
poor
mother
if
you
two
love
each
must
way
hope
bounded
in
my
pulses
as
i
noted
that
his
enthusiasm
was
now
tempered
by
thoughtfulness
no
visconti
i
murmured
with
painful
firmness
i
have
no
right
to
love
miss
i
dream
of
telling
her
so
even
if
i
am
not
not
call
oh
no
no
it
is
only
my
heart
that
is
my
is
some
one
it
can
never
be
but
what
does
it
mean
he
flashed
dark
anger
purpling
his
features
and
kindling
the
air
like
a
torch
what
did
i
see
my
girl
in
your
was
that
his
eyes
now
darted
fiery
anger
and
his
arms
were
arrested
in
the
midst
of
a
violent
gesture
i
shook
my
head
slowly
his
anger
was
infinitely
more
agreeable
to
his
parching
enthusiasm
there
was
nothing
i
answered
quietly
miss
gina
really
turned
her
ankle
on
the
rug
and
i
caught
her
as
she
as
you
would
have
done
he
stood
panting
for
a
moment
his
gaze
riveted
upon
me
at
last
he
turned
away
with
a
pitiful
movement
of
regret
apology
resignation
the
excellent
man
gave
me
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
ah
he
muttered
go
my
friend
now
i
must
think
mia
mia
will
i
say
to
her
ah
what
a
bitter
world
i
am
more
distressed
than
i
can
say
i
murmured
with
the
crushed
voice
of
poignant
suffering
but
what
can
i
nothing
he
muttered
good
night
and
my
admiration
for
his
spirit
was
high
when
he
held
out
his
trembling
hand
i
tiptoed
to
the
door
like
a
thief
and
as
i
took
my
coat
and
hat
gina
called
out
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
uncomprehending
astonishment
not
and
like
a
small
avalanche
she
shot
down
the
stairs
is
going
firmly
shouted
visconti
as
he
came
running
towards
us
he
is
called
night
good
night
i
said
and
held
out
my
hand
to
gina
but
manners
are
more
modern
than
her
she
was
dumbfounded
and
she
turned
her
back
upon
me
angrily
registering
doubtless
some
standard
emotion
from
a
favorite
movie
it
was
useless
to
try
to
placate
her
i
slipped
out
of
the
door
which
will
never
more
open
for
me
the
nightmarish
quality
of
the
episode
persisted
in
my
consciousness
like
a
drug
throughout
the
passage
homeward
and
it
was
not
until
i
entered
my
door
and
saw
a
light
in
my
study
that
reality
began
to
assert
itself
reality
meant
the
end
of
my
livelihood
the
end
of
my
hopes
and
end
of
the
tether
like
an
unfledged
boy
i
must
begin
to
breast
the
future
all
over
again
a
hero
of
romance
would
doubtless
at
that
moment
have
thrilled
to
the
struggle
with
new
and
seemingly
insuperable
obstacles
but
alas
i
am
not
a
hero
of
romance
as
i
threw
my
coat
upon
the
hatstand
a
great
weariness
and
a
deep
dejection
fell
upon
me
alicia
came
out
of
my
study
to
greet
me
as
usual
she
had
been
waiting
up
for
me
why
on
earth
you
in
bed
i
growled
irritably
alicia
scanned
my
face
amid
the
shadows
cast
by
the
lamplight
go
to
bed
child
i
repeated
go
to
bed
something
has
happened
she
murmured
frightened
something
has
happened
oh
tell
was
it
uncle
ranny
i
looked
down
at
her
with
a
scowl
that
was
meant
to
be
warning
that
i
was
in
no
mood
for
triflingness
she
seized
my
hand
still
holding
my
gaze
with
that
starry
look
in
her
eyes
that
invariably
probes
deep
and
rests
in
my
inmost
soul
something
has
hurt
you
uncle
ranny
she
whispered
tremulously
and
you
must
tell
me
our
eyes
dwelt
together
for
a
space
oh
tell
me
she
gulped
with
a
sudden
terror
dilating
her
eyes
it
come
back
oh
no
i
shuddered
involuntarily
at
the
image
she
evoked
of
pendleton
not
that
thank
heaven
alicia
no
pollyanna
you
see
the
worst
at
once
no
i
finally
muttered
looking
away
i
have
hurt
somebody
i
believe
that
she
retorted
vehemently
but
if
you
think
please
tell
me
it
will
be
so
much
better
for
you
uncle
ranny
i
had
a
sudden
impulse
to
take
her
in
my
arms
but
the
emotion
was
not
paternal
was
to
her
uncle
ranny
all
unconscious
she
was
guarded
by
her
circle
of
sacred
flames
spasmodically
i
tore
my
hand
out
of
her
grasp
and
walked
unsteadily
across
the
room
to
my
table
sit
down
over
there
i
motioned
her
as
far
away
from
me
as
possible
she
stood
still
without
complying
what
was
it
uncle
ranny
dear
she
breathed
a
sort
of
bittersweet
pain
went
through
me
at
the
epithet
and
i
reviled
myself
inwardly
for
the
impurity
of
my
dark
mind
in
the
presence
of
this
simple
lovely
purity
a
profound
sigh
escaped
me
as
i
leaned
my
elbows
on
the
table
and
made
a
feeble
effort
to
smile
at
the
mocking
visage
of
fate
i
can
not
go
back
to
any
more
alicia
i
told
her
something
has
happened
that
is
ended
i
must
look
about
for
something
else
oh
she
gasped
is
it
as
bad
as
that
as
bad
as
that
i
repeated
mechanically
then
i
know
it
was
nothing
you
could
help
she
answered
with
a
sudden
radiance
that
was
like
a
benediction
so
there
is
no
use
worrying
about
that
but
you
mean
the
money
and
her
face
clouded
anxiously
but
i
know
what
do
uncle
ranny
she
came
gliding
toward
me
there
is
always
andrews
for
me
you
know
you
remember
what
he
said
take
me
back
any
time
an
instant
of
blackness
was
succeeded
by
a
sudden
burst
of
illumination
andrews
andrews
and
the
library
all
andrews
would
either
buy
it
or
help
me
to
dispose
of
it
and
alicia
and
the
children
need
not
after
all
suffer
by
my
catastrophe
my
books
were
more
like
my
flesh
and
blood
and
to
part
with
that
consideration
was
of
singularly
brief
endurance
at
the
moment
those
books
like
a
troop
of
old
friends
would
rescue
us
all
from
like
a
phalanx
between
us
and
defeat
you
amazing
child
i
cried
leaping
to
my
feet
light
brought
me
light
andrews
very
man
i
am
going
to
andrews
i
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
and
whirled
her
about
the
room
like
a
marionette
in
a
savage
burst
of
energy
alicia
gasped
and
spinning
away
laughed
wildly
with
a
laughter
that
bordered
upon
sobs
i
dread
to
reflect
what
our
neighbors
would
have
concluded
had
they
observed
through
the
windows
the
strange
dionysian
rite
of
the
quiet
bachelor
and
his
youthful
pretty
ward
now
go
to
bed
child
i
commanded
brusquely
i
have
some
thinking
to
do
shall
i
make
you
some
coffee
she
pleaded
coming
toward
me
still
laughing
to
bed
before
i
was
aware
she
had
left
a
darting
birdlike
kiss
upon
my
cheek
and
fled
like
a
breeze
from
the
room
my
eyes
dwelt
upon
the
door
for
a
space
where
she
had
vanished
and
then
they
turned
involuntarily
to
the
serried
peaceful
rows
of
books
that
had
been
my
life
now
in
the
last
extremity
of
need
must
like
the
camel
in
the
desert
yield
up
their
blood
to
be
my
livelihood
the
following
morning
that
is
i
made
my
way
to
andrews
armed
with
my
catalogue
and
greatly
to
that
good
astonishment
offered
him
the
sale
of
my
library
he
stared
at
me
in
blank
amazement
for
an
instant
and
then
recovering
himself
declared
that
he
would
like
to
see
it
come
back
to
lunch
with
me
i
suggested
he
could
not
do
that
but
agreed
to
come
to
dinner
in
the
evening
his
shrewd
old
eyes
took
in
much
more
than
the
details
of
my
copies
and
editions
during
his
two
or
three
hours
at
my
house
with
discreet
but
observant
gaze
he
followed
the
children
about
and
measured
more
accurately
no
doubt
than
i
could
have
done
the
worth
and
solidity
of
my
household
he
had
seen
something
of
my
easy
bachelor
life
in
the
old
days
and
doubtless
was
now
drawing
his
contrasts
and
conclusions
what
do
you
think
you
can
offer
i
queried
with
some
anxiety
as
he
stood
carefully
fingering
the
books
which
like
one
talent
it
were
death
to
they
were
bread
andrews
sat
down
and
stared
for
an
interval
thoughtfully
before
him
tell
you
what
like
to
offer
you
before
we
talk
about
the
he
spoke
with
an
even
a
studied
deliberation
like
to
offer
partnership
it
was
my
turn
to
stare
in
stupefaction
it
would
be
a
great
thing
for
me
if
you
came
in
with
me
byrd
he
now
spoke
more
quickly
you
see
an
old
man
getting
on
on
i
want
some
new
blood
in
the
fresh
point
of
view
and
young
enthusiasm
that
young
lady
of
yours
coming
in
the
way
she
did
woke
me
up
to
that
and
whom
could
i
leave
it
to
when
it
comes
to
the
end
he
speculated
wistfully
i
have
no
relations
i
opened
my
mouth
to
speak
but
andrews
took
the
privilege
of
age
to
disregard
me
i
want
a
man
with
the
tender
touch
for
books
tender
touch
a
beautiful
business
he
smacked
his
beautiful
the
hunting
for
a
knightly
quest
and
to
find
homes
for
like
placing
bonny
children
the
bookmen
of
america
are
generous
we
ought
to
go
to
our
treasure
but
my
dear
andrews
i
spluttered
in
agitated
protest
do
you
know
what
you
are
offering
me
a
career
a
livelihood
life
future
of
those
children
of
can
i
contribute
except
these
compared
to
your
business
and
good
will
if
you
were
rich
he
interrupted
do
you
suppose
have
the
effrontery
to
make
you
the
offer
you
see
known
you
a
long
time
been
a
great
pleasure
to
me
if
i
had
a
and
his
voice
struck
a
harsher
note
with
things
no
use
going
into
that
that
is
the
business
for
a
man
like
you
we
all
need
money
he
pursued
with
new
energy
a
thing
to
despise
if
you
thing
for
sentimentalists
to
drivel
about
but
so
long
as
our
present
social
and
economic
system
continues
only
a
fool
would
decry
money
no
good
to
you
when
your
heart
is
breaking
but
neither
is
food
nor
water
nor
shelter
nor
leisure
but
when
you
want
food
and
shelter
and
leisure
that
is
as
long
as
above
ground
you
want
money
i
have
well
will
you
come
with
me
randolph
byrd
my
dear
good
andrews
i
paced
the
room
agitated
exultant
terrified
by
this
stroke
of
good
fortune
but
how
can
i
take
advantage
of
your
generosity
what
can
i
offer
will
you
take
my
books
as
a
contribution
to
capital
no
he
shook
his
head
with
twinkling
eyes
and
a
queer
crinkling
of
the
about
them
i
think
we
need
them
books
are
he
concluded
oracularly
with
a
ring
in
his
voice
of
the
true
reverence
say
you
will
come
my
heart
was
suddenly
flooded
by
a
rich
inundation
of
hope
this
was
permanence
that
andrews
was
holding
was
an
anchorage
it
was
neither
salmon
and
byrd
nor
this
was
my
own
peculiar
realm
and
only
a
snob
or
a
fool
could
reject
it
me
all
the
turmoil
and
troubles
of
the
past
seemed
to
be
melting
rapidly
away
like
the
shapes
in
dreams
or
unsubstantial
clouds
my
life
would
be
secure
the
children
nourished
and
educated
alicia
should
have
her
chance
be
prepared
against
the
advent
of
that
of
hers
he
he
comes
what
else
was
i
now
living
for
i
felt
as
might
have
felt
the
old
woman
of
the
nursery
rhyme
who
lived
in
a
shoe
had
any
one
suddenly
offered
her
a
cottage
of
many
chambers
with
a
future
reasonably
safe
for
her
progeny
i
saw
on
a
sudden
the
clamorous
city
that
had
more
than
once
droned
forth
my
doom
now
rich
in
prospects
and
gayly
reciting
the
flattering
tale
of
hope
in
my
hope
of
becoming
a
bookseller
in
face
of
my
dreams
of
scholarship
possibly
but
this
was
no
dream
with
a
flitting
smile
i
recognized
the
wayward
cynicism
and
irony
of
it
and
in
deep
gratitude
i
gripped
the
hand
of
andrews
to
seal
the
bargain
in
returning
to
this
all
but
neglected
record
of
the
things
that
made
up
my
life
i
realize
with
incredulity
the
passage
of
time
i
realize
too
that
when
you
live
the
most
fully
you
write
reflect
and
record
the
least
it
was
his
years
of
slavery
that
cervantes
wrote
don
quixote
and
inside
a
prison
house
that
bunyan
and
sir
walter
raleigh
composed
their
works
i
shall
never
compose
works
i
am
certain
now
for
my
lot
is
business
to
the
end
three
times
during
the
past
two
years
i
have
been
in
england
and
in
france
attending
sales
buying
books
manuscripts
and
libraries
and
very
narrowly
i
escaped
sailing
on
the
which
would
probably
have
been
the
end
of
these
memoirs
and
of
me
would
it
have
mattered
to
the
children
possibly
not
to
me
in
so
far
as
they
would
have
suffered
by
my
exit
for
though
the
business
of
books
is
to
me
the
one
nearest
akin
to
pleasure
it
is
nevertheless
a
chaffering
and
a
haggling
in
the
reverse
of
all
my
tastes
and
aptitudes
it
is
odd
that
externally
i
bear
few
of
the
marks
of
the
indolent
soul
that
possesses
me
people
viewing
me
superficially
might
think
with
andrews
that
i
am
fitted
for
stratagems
spoils
yet
how
happy
i
was
when
andrews
made
me
his
offer
how
i
plunged
into
his
gave
them
all
my
energy
the
children
i
exulted
inwardly
the
children
are
now
safe
but
nature
abhors
anomalies
to
work
for
children
alone
is
not
enough
one
desires
to
work
for
a
bosom
companion
for
some
beloved
woman
whose
breast
is
home
whose
warm
arms
are
the
one
refuge
against
the
world
whose
eyes
are
the
bright
gateways
to
heaven
that
fulfillment
i
never
had
and
never
shall
have
hence
the
anomalous
sense
of
frustration
of
incompleteness
some
psychoanalyst
would
doubtless
brand
this
as
a
complex
call
it
by
name
like
a
familiar
and
proceed
to
cure
me
of
it
but
i
am
not
going
to
any
psychoanalyst
i
know
my
trouble
and
also
its
i
can
not
call
it
after
king
oedipus
or
king
david
or
the
like
fu
il
libro
e
chi
lo
mourned
the
francesca
da
rimini
and
the
name
and
the
author
of
my
trouble
is
not
galeotto
whom
i
did
not
take
and
now
can
never
have
i
am
no
romantic
paolo
to
francesca
i
am
a
business
a
almost
alert
new
york
business
man
of
the
approved
good
pat
stereotyped
phrases
and
a
show
of
manly
sincerity
who
does
not
know
that
straight
talk
of
most
of
us
modern
business
men
under
which
we
can
hide
so
much
cunning
shrewdness
and
chicane
could
i
not
have
simply
taken
possession
of
alicia
by
a
sort
of
eminent
domain
oh
i
mean
anything
improper
i
mean
by
all
the
astute
and
usual
methods
the
and
sort
of
thing
like
the
hardheaded
pettigrew
of
american
novels
or
the
wicked
marquess
or
baronet
of
the
english
but
i
could
could
not
under
the
carapace
of
the
turtle
or
the
armadillo
is
a
body
of
flesh
with
nerves
and
blood
and
soft
living
part
so
also
under
the
shell
of
the
maligned
business
man
an
infinite
pity
and
tenderness
stir
me
at
the
thought
of
alicia
i
suddenly
feel
in
my
inmost
soul
the
softness
of
her
cheek
and
it
touches
me
as
the
delicacy
of
own
flesh
must
touch
one
if
i
had
a
child
of
my
on
that
i
must
not
let
my
mind
dwell
even
in
dreams
yet
why
not
dreams
are
all
i
am
going
to
have
and
pardie
it
is
more
than
i
deserve
much
very
much
has
been
given
to
me
and
i
ought
to
feel
profoundly
grateful
and
i
do
feel
grateful
engaged
i
can
hardly
write
the
words
though
these
are
the
words
that
have
driven
me
to
writing
again
i
have
been
happy
these
two
years
and
in
my
fashion
in
midst
of
the
tumult
and
throb
of
the
war
spirit
i
in
common
with
other
business
men
have
been
buying
and
selling
and
chaffering
and
huckstering
rearing
children
educating
alicia
and
prospering
if
newly
rich
labor
has
been
buying
motor
cars
it
must
be
admitted
that
some
abruptly
enriched
business
men
and
their
wives
have
had
time
to
turn
from
furs
and
and
interior
decorating
so
far
afield
as
my
own
remote
specialty
they
have
been
buying
by
the
yard
classics
and
first
editions
by
the
hundred
the
fact
that
that
admirable
american
the
young
widener
had
managed
to
gather
a
magnificent
collection
during
his
all
too
brief
life
has
stimulated
many
to
emulation
shelley
need
no
longer
weep
for
adonais
i
have
sold
collections
of
keats
to
gentlemen
who
have
probably
never
read
endymion
in
their
lives
and
even
now
i
am
holding
a
set
of
shelley
first
editions
only
because
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
part
with
them
to
the
very
crude
almost
illiterate
customer
who
proves
to
be
the
highest
bidder
rather
would
i
sell
them
for
less
to
a
more
enlightened
bookman
oh
yes
i
have
been
happy
in
my
fashion
yet
glancing
over
the
few
brief
scattering
entries
in
this
record
why
does
the
tinge
of
melancholy
persist
i
find
a
quotation
from
anatole
france
under
date
of
some
months
ago
to
the
point
that
even
the
most
desired
changes
have
their
sadness
for
all
that
we
leave
behind
is
a
part
of
ourselves
one
must
die
to
one
sort
of
life
in
order
to
enter
another
what
is
it
that
i
regret
or
it
is
the
mere
passage
of
time
that
makes
me
older
and
older
and
again
i
find
life
is
a
game
best
played
by
children
and
by
those
who
retain
the
hearts
of
children
to
those
who
have
the
misfortune
to
grow
up
it
is
often
a
nightmare
there
it
is
persistent
note
of
regret
time
will
take
them
all
from
including
alicia
and
then
did
i
ever
come
to
let
passion
steal
into
my
heart
i
find
some
phrases
from
hazlitt
to
the
effect
that
we
take
a
dislike
to
our
favorite
books
after
a
time
and
that
if
mankind
had
wished
for
what
is
right
they
might
have
had
it
long
ago
and
then
later
a
sort
of
credo
or
confession
or
apologia
vita
this
is
a
commercial
age
if
business
is
the
path
of
least
resistance
to
a
livelihood
so
that
a
slenderly
endowed
creature
like
myself
may
cling
to
the
surface
of
the
planet
and
pass
on
what
has
been
accomplished
to
the
generations
that
must
accomplish
that
is
the
easiest
way
then
that
is
the
way
of
nature
my
way
all
business
may
be
more
or
less
ignoble
but
if
so
who
in
the
present
state
of
evolution
can
wholly
escape
the
ignoble
yet
i
have
not
altered
in
essentials
who
shall
say
how
i
thrill
at
the
sight
of
beauty
or
the
rare
work
of
a
master
i
can
not
declare
how
my
pulses
throb
when
a
new
author
swims
into
my
new
voice
his
fresh
note
catch
at
my
throat
like
a
haunting
melody
and
i
have
known
my
eyes
to
fill
at
the
sheer
joy
of
the
discovery
oh
you
randolph
byrd
aged
seventy
when
you
come
with
your
white
hair
and
purblind
eyes
to
scan
these
notes
will
you
receive
them
at
their
face
value
will
you
believe
that
the
sense
of
frustration
underlying
them
has
to
do
with
careers
and
fame
and
lives
of
brunetto
latini
no
my
septuagenarian
have
a
respect
for
you
and
a
warm
pity
i
can
not
so
coldly
gull
advantage
of
you
damn
careers
and
business
and
brunetto
latinis
i
want
love
passionate
love
and
children
of
my
own
loins
and
the
beloved
on
my
heart
and
just
the
common
run
of
happiness
that
a
thousand
thousand
men
are
at
this
moment
enjoying
then
why
have
i
not
taken
it
why
have
i
not
taken
alicia
as
king
david
took
bathsheba
or
whatever
the
name
was
in
virtue
of
sheer
desire
and
power
because
i
have
been
a
finicking
fool
my
aged
friend
and
now
that
she
is
engaged
to
be
married
i
should
now
too
late
always
always
randolph
byrd
you
have
been
too
late
all
the
world
can
give
me
advice
and
analyze
me
yet
nobody
really
knows
me
dibdin
who
knows
me
best
of
all
in
reality
knows
me
least
he
summed
me
up
or
thought
he
did
before
his
periodical
departure
for
parts
unknown
some
twenty
months
ago
you
see
he
said
really
got
a
genius
for
kids
i
told
you
how
i
felt
about
laura
yet
what
do
i
do
i
go
off
to
the
devil
knows
where
because
i
am
a
tramp
that
is
stronger
in
me
than
anything
else
but
you
you
see
gave
up
everything
else
for
who
but
a
fool
could
blink
the
meaning
of
that
who
but
a
fool
my
dear
old
dibdin
could
be
so
blind
as
you
who
but
a
fool
could
fail
to
see
that
i
am
consumed
with
passion
for
alicia
and
had
only
been
waiting
dreading
hoping
until
she
might
be
old
enough
to
know
her
own
mind
and
waiting
too
long
and
now
alicia
is
to
my
own
nephew
life
for
me
life
in
the
rich
vivid
colorful
romantic
sense
of
the
word
is
at
an
end
my
nephew
sophomore
at
to
alicia
flashes
of
savagery
strike
into
my
heart
when
i
could
find
it
possible
to
hate
that
when
i
catch
the
pendleton
expression
in
his
face
the
pendleton
shiftiness
in
his
eyes
at
such
moments
i
experience
an
intense
all
but
irresistible
desire
to
grapple
with
him
as
on
a
certain
occasion
i
grappled
with
his
father
to
knock
his
head
against
the
wall
and
choke
that
insolent
temerity
out
of
him
with
his
last
breath
but
i
am
only
uncle
i
suppose
i
shall
do
anything
of
the
kind
have
i
not
brought
him
up
have
i
not
labored
and
toiled
for
him
watched
over
him
is
he
not
my
child
like
the
rest
there
is
something
about
the
person
the
very
flesh
of
the
child
one
has
reared
that
disarms
anger
and
turns
the
heart
to
water
his
bad
manners
hurt
more
deeply
yet
they
are
not
like
the
bad
manners
of
a
stranger
his
transgressions
are
not
like
transgressions
in
name
your
soul
cries
out
there
must
be
redeeming
features
extenuating
conditions
have
i
not
had
a
hand
in
shaping
him
and
was
he
not
ineffably
endearing
as
a
child
he
may
be
somewhat
wild
now
but
is
not
all
youth
like
that
on
its
path
to
manhood
this
is
a
point
of
view
i
see
not
a
why
why
did
that
boy
of
all
the
males
in
the
world
take
alicia
from
me
it
was
only
yesterday
that
it
happened
but
already
it
seems
like
an
ancient
calamity
that
stamps
its
victim
with
the
slow
grind
of
years
of
pain
blanches
his
flesh
and
presses
him
down
into
the
limbo
of
those
undergoing
the
slow
tortures
of
life
yet
i
was
happy
yesterday
i
came
home
at
one
as
i
do
of
saturdays
and
the
early
april
sunshine
while
still
treacherous
was
nevertheless
full
of
dazzling
promise
of
spring
of
relief
from
the
dread
winter
we
have
endured
my
head
had
been
buzzing
with
schemes
like
a
hive
the
lease
of
the
châlet
expires
in
may
and
i
was
full
of
vain
notions
of
taking
a
larger
more
attractive
house
that
should
be
a
suitable
setting
for
alicia
only
one
year
more
of
college
is
left
for
alicia
after
this
and
had
talked
of
entering
the
shop
and
i
should
have
her
with
me
all
the
time
how
i
longed
and
looked
forward
to
that
day
alicia
my
constant
companion
sharing
every
moment
of
the
day
going
and
coming
together
lunching
together
discussing
everything
who
shall
blame
me
if
i
saw
visions
and
then
perhaps
an
hour
after
lunch
they
suddenly
entered
my
study
a
or
so
behind
her
with
something
hangdog
in
his
expression
i
detest
in
alicia
head
high
flushed
with
a
look
of
desperate
resolution
about
the
somewhat
haggard
eyes
that
startled
me
i
had
been
occupied
in
turning
over
the
pages
and
collating
a
caxton
a
genuine
caxton
that
i
meant
later
to
show
to
the
royal
book
year
of
the
regne
of
king
rychard
the
thyrd
beautiful
incunabulum
randolph
moved
abruptly
forward
with
a
jerk
of
the
head
and
his
eyes
failing
to
meet
mine
he
blurted
out
huskily
engaged
uncle
and
i
what
i
yelled
harshly
as
one
in
pain
and
fell
against
the
back
of
my
chair
on
earth
do
you
mean
but
he
merely
looked
away
making
no
response
is
this
true
alicia
i
shouted
as
if
to
overtop
the
tumult
in
my
breast
yes
uncle
ranny
breathed
alicia
her
eyes
gazing
into
mine
with
a
look
so
poignantly
sad
and
charged
with
pain
that
it
froze
me
as
i
was
about
to
speak
i
sat
for
a
space
my
mouth
open
our
eyes
dwelling
together
for
an
instant
and
then
as
by
a
sudden
effort
alicia
smiled
valiantly
laid
her
hand
stoutly
on
the
shrinking
arm
and
then
abruptly
she
lowered
her
gaze
now
i
spluttered
you
are
both
so
only
a
sophomore
you
name
why
now
alicia
glanced
at
randolph
as
though
depending
on
him
to
speak
and
then
contemptuously
giving
it
up
as
hopeless
she
straightened
her
shoulders
bravely
and
murmured
in
low
distinct
tones
i
promised
randolph
he
wants
me
to
be
engaged
to
him
and
i
promised
him
i
would
mean
love
each
other
i
stammered
miserably
for
every
word
was
a
knife
thrust
into
my
own
heart
the
lad
randolph
was
now
shamed
into
a
little
manliness
yes
we
do
uncle
ranny
came
forth
in
his
throaty
voice
just
love
each
other
has
promised
to
be
engaged
to
me
i
am
through
college
and
get
a
job
i
suppose
it
had
to
come
uncle
ranny
explained
alicia
with
what
seemed
to
me
a
very
labored
serenity
we
grew
up
together
we
have
been
such
chums
randolph
seemed
need
me
you
see
uncle
ranny
there
was
a
piteous
note
of
appeal
in
her
voice
which
only
seemed
to
lacerate
me
the
more
but
i
could
not
speak
the
sunshine
had
gone
out
of
the
april
afternoon
waves
of
darkness
seemed
to
be
beating
over
me
and
the
strength
and
energy
of
a
few
minutes
back
had
oozed
out
of
me
like
so
much
water
so
weak
and
shattered
did
i
feel
that
on
a
sudden
i
was
seized
by
a
panic
fear
of
collapse
please
leave
me
now
my
lips
strange
cold
dead
things
that
seemed
in
no
way
a
part
of
my
body
brought
forth
mechanically
yet
with
heavy
effort
a
discuss
it
later
i
do
not
envy
those
two
the
sight
of
my
face
at
that
moment
i
am
pretty
certain
randolph
did
not
see
it
for
he
turned
away
but
i
am
in
doubt
about
alicia
her
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
and
she
came
toward
me
with
a
sudden
curious
movement
of
the
hands
as
though
she
felt
rather
than
saw
her
way
then
abruptly
her
hands
dropped
to
her
side
and
she
paused
and
turned
back
sharply
they
left
me
then
both
of
them
i
remained
stunned
alone
and
suffering
agony
though
i
am
there
is
now
in
me
a
strange
new
sense
of
familiarity
with
suffering
anguish
and
heartache
thank
god
are
no
longer
novelties
that
much
anodyne
the
sheer
business
of
living
does
bring
to
one
i
am
as
sensitive
to
them
as
ever
i
was
in
my
prehistoric
days
of
ease
and
leisure
and
reclusion
but
they
are
old
acquaintances
now
i
must
go
on
hiding
my
dolor
as
best
i
can
working
for
the
sunny
comely
lad
jimmie
so
brilliant
with
promise
for
the
grave
laura
replica
of
her
mother
randolph
and
alicia
i
can
not
rant
and
i
must
not
betray
any
grief
or
make
a
spectacle
of
myself
before
them
i
must
carry
on
small
as
might
be
your
lamp
observes
the
sage
of
belgium
never
part
with
the
oil
that
feeds
it
but
only
give
the
flame
that
crowns
it
a
poor
and
tenuous
oil
is
that
of
my
peculiar
lamp
a
petty
flame
and
a
murky
result
but
such
as
they
are
i
must
guard
them
i
can
not
down
the
feeling
however
that
there
is
some
mystery
some
secret
reason
behind
this
development
between
alicia
and
the
boy
with
a
leaden
heart
i
must
record
it
that
he
has
proven
a
disappointment
to
me
his
mediocrity
as
a
student
concerns
me
less
than
his
general
tendency
to
shiftiness
his
unsteady
eye
and
his
heavy
drooping
nether
lip
when
he
tells
me
that
he
spent
the
night
with
the
fellows
at
the
frat
house
that
a
got
to
associate
with
friends
of
his
own
age
that
got
to
make
friends
and
so
on
he
is
through
his
allowance
four
days
after
receiving
it
and
repeatedly
begs
for
more
more
than
once
i
have
caught
the
odor
of
alcohol
about
him
as
he
came
in
late
at
night
and
only
the
fact
that
he
is
boy
and
that
i
have
reared
him
has
made
me
condone
his
many
offenses
have
i
been
spoiling
him
i
wonder
would
i
have
condoned
and
tolerated
as
much
if
he
were
my
own
son
he
is
over
a
year
younger
than
alicia
and
though
a
handsome
enough
lad
in
his
way
i
fancy
i
see
too
much
of
pendleton
in
his
face
for
comfort
his
father
also
was
markedly
when
he
married
poor
laura
have
i
i
wonder
been
rearing
another
pendleton
but
alicia
the
bright
the
fair
the
radiant
almost
a
woman
now
with
more
wisdom
than
i
ever
before
found
in
came
she
to
do
such
a
thing
as
to
engage
herself
to
him
i
can
understand
his
possible
infatuation
but
a
girl
i
had
always
believed
learns
her
arts
by
instinct
how
can
she
be
so
blind
to
the
character
and
defects
can
it
be
that
she
really
loves
him
love
love
love
that
blind
force
that
is
said
to
move
the
can
it
be
so
haggard
gaunt
and
painful
a
thing
in
the
ordinary
light
of
day
woe
is
me
that
i
am
too
dull
to
comprehend
it
like
the
blooded
horse
in
that
bites
his
own
vein
to
ease
his
overstrained
heart
i
must
bleed
must
suffer
and
endure
since
it
is
for
you
randolph
byrd
aged
seventy
that
this
vagrom
journal
has
been
written
i
should
deem
myself
derelict
and
insincere
if
i
did
not
convey
to
you
in
every
detail
the
sort
of
creature
you
were
in
middle
life
if
you
fail
to
approve
of
your
progenitor
i
shall
know
that
i
have
been
exact
for
i
fail
to
approve
of
him
myself
we
are
at
war
every
fiber
in
me
should
thrill
to
the
declaration
of
war
against
germany
but
here
i
have
been
calmly
turning
the
pages
of
the
description
of
a
maske
by
thomas
campion
churchyard
in
fleetstreet
it
is
a
beautiful
volume
in
excellent
preservation
one
of
five
brought
in
by
a
young
man
who
is
going
to
enlist
he
inherited
them
from
a
grandfather
possibly
an
old
fellow
like
you
who
held
them
precious
i
bought
them
eagerly
for
i
know
where
i
can
dispose
of
them
though
i
should
dearly
like
to
place
them
in
my
own
shelves
we
shall
make
a
profit
on
them
and
a
handsome
one
that
is
the
sort
of
thought
that
runs
through
my
head
randolph
byrd
and
that
is
the
sort
of
man
you
were
thirty
odd
years
ago
you
never
were
young
in
your
youth
my
fine
friend
perhaps
you
will
grow
younger
as
you
grow
older
but
that
is
not
all
above
the
sensuous
pleasure
in
the
books
and
overriding
the
thought
of
lucre
is
the
strange
romance
of
alicia
and
your
namesake
randolph
pendleton
it
blasts
all
my
previous
conceptions
of
romance
where
is
the
color
and
the
warmth
and
the
glory
of
it
i
had
expected
after
their
announcement
of
a
few
days
ago
that
i
should
be
bitterly
engaged
in
watching
a
glorious
april
dawn
that
would
blind
me
with
its
strange
flames
because
it
was
not
for
me
instead
i
seem
to
see
only
a
somber
murky
twilight
whenever
i
surprise
those
two
in
private
colloquy
the
mere
thought
of
the
possibility
of
alicia
loving
me
fantastic
arrogance
was
wont
to
irradiate
my
heart
and
to
make
me
positively
so
that
i
could
scarcely
withhold
my
lips
from
smiling
publicly
but
my
young
cub
of
a
nephew
seems
haggard
and
obsessed
by
care
and
upon
eyes
i
have
more
than
once
observed
traces
of
tears
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
that
were
i
in
reality
a
parent
instead
of
masquerading
as
one
i
should
no
doubt
endeavor
to
fathom
this
mystery
but
you
see
i
am
still
as
always
inadequate
the
truth
is
i
dare
not
yet
talk
to
alicia
about
her
love
a
little
later
randolph
byrd
a
little
the
pain
is
more
decently
domesticated
in
my
bosom
and
will
not
fly
out
like
a
newly
unchained
hound
meanwhile
is
it
not
best
that
i
fasten
my
attention
upon
thomas
campion
his
maske
i
may
fill
a
little
of
the
interim
perhaps
by
telling
you
what
i
had
passed
over
in
the
busy
silence
of
the
last
two
or
three
years
that
fred
salmon
has
attempted
to
make
fred
salmon
who
was
the
means
of
my
losing
all
of
the
meager
capital
you
should
have
lived
upon
in
your
old
age
has
reappeared
with
a
commendable
attempt
at
restitution
begoggled
and
he
drove
up
to
the
châlet
some
ten
months
ago
in
a
magnificently
shining
car
of
bizarre
design
and
he
entered
my
door
booming
like
not
too
distant
thunder
hello
ranny
he
shouted
out
and
in
a
twinkling
my
study
seemed
to
be
brimming
with
him
inundated
by
him
overflowing
with
fred
and
his
salmonism
have
a
cigar
my
are
you
is
the
family
is
the
book
business
which
am
i
to
answer
first
i
grinned
mildly
never
mind
roared
fred
i
see
all
right
ask
me
tricks
with
me
he
was
so
obviously
bursting
with
news
that
i
complied
at
once
very
are
your
tricks
fred
booming
booming
randolph
my
kiting
jack
morgan
himself
blush
to
be
in
what
got
into
put
that
on
your
piano
randolph
my
boy
fred
is
one
of
those
who
likes
to
talk
of
jack
morgan
harry
davison
gene
meyer
and
barney
baruch
as
though
they
were
his
daily
cocktail
companions
this
distant
familiarity
of
moneyed
men
gives
him
a
strange
exuberance
consider
that
i
have
tried
it
on
my
piano
and
like
the
prelude
i
told
him
now
for
the
rest
of
the
opus
oh
fudge
he
laughed
gosh
a
great
old
bird
old
bird
well
listen
here
he
ran
on
wild
horses
could
not
have
held
you
think
i
like
to
brag
you
deny
know
you
do
well
truth
randolph
i
do
some
folks
are
like
for
instance
but
i
had
nothing
to
brag
about
see
so
i
made
up
my
mind
get
into
something
so
good
it
could
stand
any
amount
of
bragging
so
what
do
i
do
but
go
into
randolph
my
now
got
got
it
rich
say
going
to
be
filthy
with
it
randolph
positively
oozing
crawling
with
money
how
with
me
boy
congratulations
i
held
out
my
hand
he
gripped
it
hard
and
what
do
you
do
with
your
millions
i
added
blandly
oh
i
got
yet
he
shouted
but
coming
on
the
way
on
the
way
i
hear
the
sound
of
their
dear
little
golden
feet
right
sound
you
ever
heard
and
that
reminds
me
and
on
a
sudden
he
opened
his
duster
and
from
his
bosom
pocket
brought
forth
a
number
of
dazzling
yellow
certificates
with
gorgeous
blood
red
seals
upon
them
see
these
his
large
features
were
beaming
a
flood
of
generosity
remember
that
thousand
you
put
in
of
your
own
spondulix
just
before
salmon
and
byrd
went
blooy
well
this
is
that
here
is
a
thousand
shares
of
salmon
oil
to
cover
that
some
day
cash
in
with
interest
my
interest
you
forget
it
i
stared
at
him
in
silence
for
a
space
but
so
genuine
and
sincere
seemed
his
air
of
righteous
triumph
that
i
repressed
the
rabelaisian
laughter
that
shook
me
inwardly
and
only
said
thank
you
fred
man
say
a
word
shouted
fred
thumping
me
on
the
back
all
to
the
good
by
the
way
i
could
not
help
adding
after
a
glowing
moment
what
is
the
stock
selling
at
now
not
for
nothing
am
i
the
partner
of
the
canny
andrews
oh
now
retorted
fred
in
a
tone
somewhat
injured
at
my
lack
of
now
it
selling
at
not
issued
yet
see
we
floated
it
yet
giving
you
this
out
of
mine
you
sell
it
for
a
year
this
is
stock
but
never
fear
my
boy
this
will
net
you
more
than
thousand
some
day
or
my
hubbard
squash
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
hail
fred
as
a
philanthropist
and
humanitarian
and
to
thank
him
for
his
certificates
augury
of
fabulous
riches
to
come
i
keep
a
small
iron
safe
in
my
study
now
to
house
such
precious
objects
as
the
campion
maske
and
the
caxton
that
i
bring
home
overnight
or
longer
for
study
and
collation
very
solemnly
i
clicked
the
combination
lock
opened
the
safe
and
carefully
with
ritualistic
almost
hieratic
movements
i
reverently
put
certificates
into
one
of
the
little
drawers
fred
watched
me
attentively
that
ceremony
seemed
to
answer
his
sense
of
the
dramatic
yes
sir
he
nodded
with
great
satisfaction
as
a
period
to
my
movements
you
have
put
away
a
little
gold
mine
there
my
boy
and
you
have
to
work
it
either
do
that
all
have
to
do
is
to
cash
the
dividend
checks
and
a
word
in
your
ear
randolph
if
i
you
and
tell
you
to
buy
more
just
you
do
it
you
do
it
without
describing
to
him
my
momentary
mental
reservation
i
as
it
were
promised
and
oh
say
bubbled
fred
struck
by
a
sudden
memory
who
do
you
think
is
in
on
this
property
with
me
never
guess
in
the
world
so
might
as
well
tell
you
our
old
college
chum
a
great
little
sport
that
guinea
is
let
your
uncle
fred
tell
you
got
the
spondulix
boy
and
have
more
he
will
strike
it
rich
on
this
deal
you
bet
your
hat
and
be
richer
than
ever
and
say
one
idea
seemed
to
follow
another
in
brain
like
salmon
running
over
rapids
he
got
a
peacherine
of
a
daughter
the
old
boy
know
her
great
girl
good
sport
she
and
great
pals
that
girl
and
dancing
he
shook
and
quivered
in
a
sudden
fragmentary
movement
of
the
latest
great
sport
he
concluded
panting
ponderously
angels
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
i
heard
myself
murmuring
here
what
you
praying
about
demanded
fred
humorously
suspicious
it
was
an
invocation
fred
i
explained
the
most
wonderful
thing
i
ever
heard
why
you
and
gina
are
meant
for
each
other
a
fine
american
girl
almost
said
fina
americana
girl
and
were
simply
created
for
each
other
say
grinned
fred
exultantly
honest
randolph
do
you
think
so
i
do
most
certainly
well
and
see
stop
look
waiting
is
the
word
he
muttered
mysteriously
old
man
got
to
shoot
away
from
here
now
remember
what
i
said
buy
until
you
hear
from
me
nor
sell
until
you
hear
from
me
stay
to
lunch
i
begged
after
all
sunday
sorry
he
returned
importantly
big
things
brewing
see
you
again
and
he
was
gone
such
was
the
recrudescence
of
fred
salmon
and
the
certificates
are
still
in
my
safe
in
witness
of
it
and
greatly
to
my
surprise
they
have
a
market
value
now
even
though
i
can
not
sell
them
judging
by
the
curb
quotations
the
leaflets
are
worth
ten
thousand
dollars
but
i
know
too
well
that
something
will
happen
before
the
year
is
up
and
they
will
be
worthless
again
how
should
it
be
otherwise
since
they
are
mine
fred
salmon
was
never
meant
to
be
a
whisperer
or
a
negotiator
of
secret
treaties
the
children
in
the
house
that
sunday
morning
could
not
fail
to
overhear
him
and
ever
since
he
has
been
known
to
them
and
referred
to
as
millions
there
is
no
contour
to
life
life
is
chaotic
whenever
i
thought
of
fred
as
marrying
at
all
i
had
mentally
mated
him
with
gertrude
that
in
my
opinion
would
have
been
an
ideally
eugenic
combination
but
instead
fred
is
obviously
attaching
himself
to
gina
and
gertrude
has
been
eighteen
months
married
to
minot
blackden
the
rediscoverer
of
they
live
happily
in
apartments
about
a
mile
apart
and
i
am
told
breakfast
together
occasionally
and
this
notation
oh
my
aged
correspondent
proves
to
me
that
i
am
not
a
novelist
for
were
i
a
novelist
i
should
doubtless
idealize
these
as
i
note
them
old
cold
flame
to
blackden
there
ought
to
be
a
chapter
of
veritable
lyric
epithalamium
upon
those
highly
modern
spousals
blackden
should
fix
them
forever
in
a
series
of
windows
instead
of
that
my
feeling
is
what
am
i
to
gertrude
now
or
what
is
gertrude
to
me
no
more
than
hecuba
to
the
player
in
always
in
place
of
romance
reality
seems
to
break
in
to
take
possession
of
my
pen
and
i
find
myself
recording
events
as
they
happen
without
varnish
or
adornment
but
if
my
pen
is
so
veracious
as
i
have
intimated
above
why
is
it
so
overproud
and
as
not
to
record
the
torture
that
persists
beneath
the
seemingly
calm
surface
of
life
the
agony
the
anguish
of
seeing
alicia
daily
under
unaltered
conditions
the
same
beloved
alicia
yet
with
a
barrier
reared
before
her
to
which
the
screen
of
the
sleeping
beauty
was
a
miserable
clipped
privet
hedge
to
which
circle
of
fire
was
a
pitiful
trick
having
been
forced
by
the
pressure
of
circumstance
into
ordered
and
natural
life
i
am
now
maddened
by
a
passion
to
straighten
it
altogether
out
of
its
odd
contortions
and
entanglements
my
soul
cries
out
to
live
naturally
and
virtually
whispers
to
me
every
day
that
natural
living
is
the
first
requisite
to
constructively
social
living
i
see
heights
glimmering
of
service
of
great
impersonal
only
through
personal
love
lies
my
path
toward
them
in
other
words
i
am
now
aware
that
you
can
not
like
another
aaron
latta
violate
the
feelings
of
sex
a
few
primal
instincts
there
are
so
tremendously
important
so
powerfully
imbedded
in
the
human
in
the
animal
organism
that
to
violate
them
is
to
twist
and
crumple
the
personality
the
very
soul
within
itself
a
normal
man
must
wive
and
beget
and
rear
before
his
imagination
is
disentangled
and
freed
for
the
constructive
and
corporate
life
of
his
use
to
society
is
real
and
stable
reliable
and
not
a
sham
i
have
reared
children
but
i
have
never
had
a
wife
or
ever
begotten
any
children
of
my
own
alicia
embodies
the
completion
of
life
for
alicia
is
now
pledged
to
some
one
else
leaving
my
world
empty
and
meaningless
come
what
will
and
avoid
me
as
she
may
existence
can
not
go
on
in
this
manner
i
must
take
the
risk
of
private
talk
with
my
pain
possibly
but
for
my
information
inevitably
is
she
in
reality
in
love
with
my
nephew
alicia
i
began
gruffly
this
evening
after
dinner
i
want
to
talk
to
you
will
you
come
into
my
study
in
a
few
minutes
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
mine
searchingly
for
an
instant
and
lowered
them
again
swiftly
yes
uncle
ranny
she
murmured
there
are
times
when
i
feel
i
could
jump
out
of
my
skin
as
the
phrase
is
when
she
calls
me
uncle
ranny
that
uncleship
has
been
my
undoing
yet
what
a
wealth
of
prerogatives
it
has
brought
me
i
chose
this
evening
because
somehow
all
the
world
lay
tranquillized
gusts
of
wind
and
plumps
of
april
rain
during
the
day
gave
way
to
a
great
stillness
even
over
this
suburban
countryside
where
the
rumble
of
the
trains
is
never
absent
but
the
humid
smell
of
the
newly
stirring
earth
was
still
in
my
nostrils
and
our
little
lawn
was
already
green
with
young
grass
one
could
almost
hear
the
sap
mounting
in
the
trees
there
was
a
vernal
feeling
of
peace
and
hope
in
the
my
very
nerves
we
were
in
particular
good
humor
moreover
under
the
influence
of
table
talk
that
boy
is
a
source
of
constant
delight
and
bubbles
vitality
like
a
fountain
his
presence
in
a
room
positively
gives
the
effect
of
added
light
he
is
just
now
in
love
with
long
words
and
announced
that
he
would
give
me
a
composition
on
how
to
tie
a
necktie
he
meant
a
demonstration
and
we
all
laughed
heartily
never
mind
murmured
jimmie
cheerfully
to
himself
forget
that
one
griselda
declares
he
is
exactly
as
i
was
at
his
age
but
i
am
certain
i
never
was
half
so
delightful
laura
was
not
with
us
she
is
at
a
at
rye
this
year
and
comes
home
only
upon
alternate
laura
sweet
and
like
her
mother
is
never
as
hilarious
as
the
rest
of
us
often
are
my
nephew
randolph
was
also
absent
he
i
suppose
was
dining
at
his
eternal
frat
house
it
occurred
to
me
how
happy
we
could
be
just
the
three
of
us
alicia
jimmie
and
of
course
griselda
alicia
is
beautiful
now
with
a
tender
coloring
and
movements
of
exuberant
gayety
that
are
like
wine
to
the
heart
when
her
face
is
animated
and
her
eyes
flashing
with
merriment
the
house
seems
charged
with
the
very
elixir
of
delight
of
late
however
i
have
seen
little
of
her
gayety
and
more
of
her
pensive
silent
mood
and
that
has
been
depressing
but
alicia
was
her
old
lovely
self
of
the
days
before
the
engagement
and
i
seized
the
occasion
to
discover
what
i
could
about
that
puzzle
alone
in
my
study
puffing
at
a
cigarette
which
might
have
been
a
string
of
hemp
for
all
the
taste
i
discerned
in
it
i
feasted
my
mental
eyes
for
the
time
upon
the
picture
of
alicia
married
to
me
greeting
me
as
a
wife
upon
my
at
night
nestling
in
my
arms
for
the
delicious
intimate
fragmentary
talk
of
the
day
lived
through
of
the
myriad
little
threads
that
take
their
place
in
the
woof
of
life
only
after
the
beloved
has
touched
them
with
her
love
the
long
quiet
evenings
of
intimacy
and
the
nights
which
in
phrase
become
a
beautiful
half
of
the
life
span
am
i
immoral
o
randolph
of
seventy
then
i
dismally
fear
i
am
immoral
for
these
are
the
pictures
old
man
and
these
the
thoughts
that
produce
as
they
certainly
are
for
me
for
alicia
is
my
child
and
whatever
happens
she
must
not
suspect
them
with
an
effort
and
a
corrugated
brow
i
dismissed
them
as
i
heard
step
on
the
doorway
very
straight
and
demure
she
was
as
she
entered
bringing
with
her
that
aura
of
infinitude
which
always
quickens
my
foolish
pulses
sit
down
alicia
i
waved
her
to
a
chair
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
is
anything
the
matter
uncle
ranny
with
exaggerated
naturalness
i
only
wanted
to
talk
to
you
jimmie
cunning
she
laughed
slipping
into
a
chair
he
says
he
is
going
to
be
a
writer
like
mark
twain
and
let
you
sell
his
books
this
environment
he
says
is
enough
to
make
a
writer
of
any
fellow
i
laughed
tell
me
i
began
briskly
enough
and
then
noting
her
eyes
upon
me
those
deep
eyes
of
a
woman
i
faltered
do
did
this
love
affair
between
you
and
randolph
begin
alicia
made
no
answer
was
it
that
and
i
snapped
my
fingers
still
clinging
to
the
spirit
of
lightness
with
which
we
had
left
the
table
i
have
loved
all
of
she
murmured
gazing
downward
ever
since
been
with
them
i
know
have
do
and
my
laugh
sounded
in
my
own
ears
like
the
grating
of
rough
metallic
surfaces
together
but
i
go
marrying
you
i
a
very
serious
business
alicia
this
marrying
how
dull
and
prosy
the
words
fell
upon
the
air
about
me
does
middle
age
mean
being
prosy
when
you
mean
to
be
alert
bright
and
crisp
yet
i
feel
younger
than
any
of
them
her
face
lifting
slowly
and
her
gray
eyes
searching
mine
suddenly
struck
me
as
so
piteously
sad
that
i
then
and
there
wrote
myself
down
an
ass
and
a
cad
and
turned
away
to
hide
my
shame
i
know
serious
uncle
ranny
and
her
voice
was
like
the
muted
strings
of
a
violin
but
you
think
i
understand
please
be
afraid
of
you
trust
and
she
left
her
chair
and
made
a
step
toward
me
with
an
imploring
gesture
of
the
hands
i
am
not
a
designing
woman
she
declared
with
a
half
smile
and
then
she
ran
on
more
vehemently
i
know
that
randolph
is
younger
than
i
he
can
tire
of
me
a
hundred
times
before
he
is
ready
to
marry
oh
we
are
a
long
way
from
marrying
but
begged
me
be
engaged
to
him
for
certain
reasons
that
i
tell
i
agreed
and
keep
my
word
if
he
and
there
she
paused
a
solemn
quite
maternal
tenderness
in
her
face
as
she
uttered
those
words
so
fascinated
me
that
suddenly
i
saw
her
new
with
a
strange
tug
at
the
heartstrings
i
marveled
at
the
miracle
i
saw
her
suddenly
not
as
woman
but
as
mother
of
mankind
the
nurse
the
nourisher
of
all
the
generations
there
was
in
her
eyes
a
something
rapt
and
was
the
eternal
maternal
principle
in
nature
the
keeper
of
destiny
older
than
i
as
old
as
the
spirit
of
motherhood
and
was
engaged
to
randolph
then
as
though
emerging
from
a
maze
i
blurted
out
you
are
not
in
love
with
him
then
of
course
i
love
him
she
returned
with
fire
i
love
everybody
in
this
house
this
has
been
to
me
why
i
you
randolph
byrd
are
men
so
blind
trusted
you
all
my
life
as
if
you
were
you
let
me
got
to
trust
me
can
tell
never
regret
it
please
uncle
ranny
press
me
any
more
she
added
more
plaintively
her
force
suddenly
leaving
her
as
though
she
had
come
to
herself
with
a
shock
a
gush
of
tears
filled
her
eyes
hard
on
me
she
faltered
her
hand
groped
for
the
chair
behind
her
and
she
sank
weeping
into
it
alicia
my
god
i
cried
out
choking
flesh
and
blood
could
not
bear
it
i
leaped
toward
her
with
a
wild
impulse
to
take
her
in
my
arms
to
comfort
her
to
pour
out
against
her
lips
the
truth
that
i
trusted
her
and
loved
her
more
than
any
human
being
on
earth
my
arms
went
out
and
all
but
engulfed
her
checked
myself
a
powerful
inhibition
suddenly
held
me
arrested
as
in
a
vise
both
the
curse
and
the
blessing
of
middle
age
were
inherent
in
that
inhibition
if
i
had
so
much
as
touched
her
then
i
knew
in
a
flash
of
quivering
intuition
that
the
truth
i
had
perforce
so
carefully
guarded
would
be
spilled
like
water
if
i
touched
her
then
i
was
lost
hastily
i
retreated
a
step
or
two
for
a
space
of
intense
charged
silence
alicia
sat
drying
her
eyes
a
little
crumpled
niobe
the
while
i
with
trembling
fingers
of
the
hand
that
was
on
my
table
fumbled
stupidly
in
the
cigarette
box
trust
you
alicia
i
muttered
with
an
immense
effort
to
control
my
voice
i
trust
you
beyond
any
one
you
are
mistress
in
this
house
do
whatever
you
think
best
i
mean
to
make
you
cry
child
forgive
me
have
answered
my
question
now
have
any
more
and
lighting
a
cigarette
automatically
i
now
approached
her
and
stood
nearer
to
her
uncle
ranny
she
faltered
she
had
called
me
randolph
byrd
in
her
vehemence
and
the
sound
of
it
was
still
reverberating
in
my
brain
but
i
was
back
to
uncle
ranny
like
another
cinderella
in
her
pumpkin
do
you
know
what
you
are
alicia
i
stood
over
her
puffing
and
chattering
against
time
you
are
an
girl
what
you
emotions
all
sorts
of
curious
traits
when
you
ought
to
be
discussing
freud
and
complexes
and
the
single
standard
and
the
right
of
the
right
of
woman
i
had
almost
said
to
motherhood
irrespective
of
marriage
upon
which
i
had
heard
a
fashionable
young
woman
descant
only
that
morning
in
the
shop
apropos
of
a
book
she
was
buying
on
the
dark
lady
of
the
sonnets
but
i
paused
in
time
and
all
sorts
of
things
i
trailed
off
lamely
yes
she
murmured
a
faint
sad
smile
wavering
on
her
lips
do
that
next
time
deliver
a
lecture
to
jimmie
some
evening
on
the
oedipus
why
inadvisable
to
marry
your
own
grandmother
clearly
alicia
is
no
stranger
to
the
patter
of
the
time
but
what
a
glorious
natural
creature
she
is
her
touch
of
satire
after
her
tempest
of
emotion
ravished
me
as
perhaps
nothing
else
how
adorable
she
was
in
all
her
moods
do
it
now
alicia
i
cried
must
go
up
and
wash
my
face
she
murmured
i
bear
to
let
her
go
is
randolph
i
clutched
at
her
presence
for
another
instant
i
know
and
with
a
sudden
swift
movement
she
glided
out
of
the
room
if
only
she
knew
how
bewitching
she
is
but
perhaps
she
is
better
ignorant
one
thing
is
certain
she
has
answered
my
question
she
is
not
in
love
with
randolph
dimly
i
perceive
a
faint
cohesiveness
to
the
swimming
lines
of
the
picture
for
some
reason
that
she
knows
best
that
seemed
good
to
her
she
yielded
to
the
importunities
in
some
way
the
mother
in
her
is
involved
how
little
after
all
i
know
of
my
eldest
nephew
alicia
doubtless
knows
more
but
this
is
the
query
that
rises
before
me
like
a
black
pillar
in
the
roadway
can
that
splendid
girl
be
deliberately
planning
to
sacrifice
herself
for
some
real
or
fancied
good
to
the
the
while
that
by
the
time
his
dangers
are
past
he
might
tire
of
her
and
release
her
plighted
word
but
suppose
he
indeed
how
could
he
can
i
risk
her
happiness
in
that
happiness
which
means
to
me
a
thousand
times
more
than
my
own
my
own
to
think
of
that
new
whatever
alicia
did
or
betray
it
was
patently
obvious
that
i
am
simply
uncle
ever
was
for
one
instant
of
excitement
i
was
randolph
only
for
that
ah
well
no
use
to
dwell
upon
that
bitterness
now
but
about
that
young
would
i
better
do
my
aged
counselor
doubtless
at
seventy
you
will
be
able
to
give
me
the
sagest
of
advice
but
that
will
be
too
late
friend
too
late
i
must
watch
more
closely
from
this
moment
on
i
have
much
to
learn
randolph
byrd
of
this
however
i
am
certain
one
individual
may
with
nobility
sacrifice
his
life
for
another
that
according
to
my
lights
is
inherent
in
the
very
order
of
the
universe
but
every
one
is
entitled
to
his
or
her
own
happiness
woe
and
shame
to
the
crippled
soul
that
allows
another
to
maim
him
in
his
happiness
every
human
being
has
the
unequivocal
right
to
his
share
i
am
rambling
i
see
my
brain
doubtless
is
still
awhirl
with
the
emotions
and
overtones
of
the
interview
with
alicia
the
headlines
of
the
evening
paper
over
which
my
tired
eyes
stray
are
vocal
with
the
war
spirit
with
news
of
bridges
guarded
of
preparations
of
munitions
of
espionage
of
ships
troops
volunteering
but
the
import
of
these
makes
hardly
an
impression
upon
my
mind
so
impersonal
a
thing
is
patriotism
juxtaposed
to
the
intimate
business
of
living
it
is
late
i
must
go
to
bed
fiancé
has
not
yet
come
in
arrived
a
letter
which
overshadows
all
else
which
momentarily
put
even
my
last
talk
with
alicia
in
the
background
and
aroused
strange
sleeping
instincts
of
alarm
of
combat
of
savage
alertness
the
last
thing
i
could
now
have
expected
or
thought
of
was
this
letter
from
pendleton
the
brilliant
april
sun
turned
darker
as
i
opened
it
and
the
warmth
went
out
of
the
vernal
air
turning
spring
back
into
winter
this
is
what
i
read
dear
randolph
i
am
writing
you
from
hospital
in
san
francisco
a
business
trip
that
brought
me
here
laid
me
flat
with
typhoid
and
all
my
money
what
remained
for
the
return
trip
to
kobe
is
gone
i
ask
you
to
do
me
the
great
favor
of
advancing
me
three
hundred
dollars
i
shall
be
out
of
hospital
in
a
week
or
ten
days
at
most
and
i
want
to
return
at
once
immediately
i
get
back
to
kobe
i
shall
send
you
a
draft
in
repayment
you
must
do
this
for
me
randolph
as
i
have
no
one
else
to
turn
to
unless
i
can
get
back
i
am
stranded
and
my
only
alternative
will
be
to
beat
my
way
back
to
new
york
which
is
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
please
let
me
hear
from
you
by
wire
that
do
this
faithfully
jim
pendleton
the
impudent
blackmailing
scoundrel
his
only
alternative
will
be
new
york
that
is
his
threat
and
as
a
threat
he
means
it
yet
i
would
send
him
the
money
willingly
if
only
i
were
sure
that
he
would
really
use
it
for
passage
to
kobe
or
to
the
long
as
it
is
far
enough
away
but
what
security
have
i
nevertheless
it
comes
to
me
sadly
that
i
shall
have
to
take
the
risk
and
send
him
the
money
to
have
pendleton
in
new
york
any
cost
i
must
take
any
chance
to
prevent
that
and
arrant
blackmailer
that
he
is
he
understands
that
what
could
he
do
if
he
were
here
the
children
though
all
minors
the
two
eldest
are
old
enough
to
choose
and
i
believe
i
am
secure
in
my
feelings
as
to
their
choice
he
will
not
moreover
be
charging
himself
with
the
responsibility
of
the
children
if
only
i
seem
indifferent
enough
as
to
whether
he
takes
them
or
not
alicia
he
is
powerless
to
touch
oh
i
have
learned
something
of
the
weapons
needed
to
fight
such
a
beast
but
it
is
his
hateful
presence
that
i
can
not
stomach
the
thought
of
and
that
he
knows
also
i
must
send
him
the
money
and
take
the
chance
that
he
will
really
return
to
his
accustomed
lairs
it
will
be
an
uneasy
time
for
a
while
nevertheless
but
too
much
ease
would
now
sit
queerly
upon
my
shoulders
i
shall
send
him
the
money
i
have
had
a
week
of
illness
and
it
has
been
the
happiest
of
my
life
alicia
has
been
my
nurse
and
no
one
i
fervently
hope
will
ever
discover
that
the
larger
half
of
that
week
has
been
sheer
malingering
i
might
have
got
up
in
three
days
late
to
hearken
late
to
smile
but
better
late
than
never
i
shall
have
lived
a
little
while
before
i
die
forever
the
shropshire
lad
was
perfectly
right
in
the
two
middle
lines
of
his
quatrain
but
oddly
wrong
in
the
others
it
was
late
to
hearken
or
to
smile
it
never
is
late
every
moment
has
been
heavenly
for
me
and
who
ever
stops
to
dwell
upon
purgatory
once
he
has
entered
paradise
i
am
very
certain
that
by
a
law
of
spiritual
physics
past
suffering
is
wiped
out
without
a
trace
if
the
rosary
were
not
so
absurd
i
should
sing
it
to
myself
over
and
over
but
being
constructively
a
convalescent
why
may
i
not
be
absurd
who
shall
say
me
nay
so
being
alone
i
am
humming
the
tune
of
the
rosary
over
and
over
and
taking
my
pleasure
in
it
the
hours
i
have
spent
with
alicia
no
one
can
take
from
me
what
a
petulant
patient
i
have
been
i
chuckle
as
i
think
of
it
like
happy
alicia
let
us
say
brings
me
some
broth
upon
a
tray
will
you
be
comfortable
uncle
ranny
she
asks
with
concern
in
her
voice
until
i
come
back
with
the
rest
no
growls
the
eccentric
uncle
not
a
bit
of
it
i
want
company
while
i
eat
alicia
laughs
softly
but
who
is
going
to
prepare
the
other
tray
while
griselda
is
so
busy
care
mutters
the
grouchy
invalid
i
want
company
if
i
let
you
go
now
will
you
bring
up
your
own
luncheon
and
eat
it
here
but
that
makes
such
a
lot
of
dishes
uncle
ranny
care
obstinate
fussy
irritable
sick
have
to
be
humored
ask
the
doctor
alicia
peals
a
delicious
silvery
laugh
and
then
i
see
a
film
as
of
tears
in
her
eyes
all
humor
you
uncle
ranny
but
i
should
think
be
sick
of
seeing
me
round
by
this
time
am
sick
growl
i
get
a
colored
nurse
whereupon
i
hear
laughter
all
the
way
down
the
stairs
i
wonder
why
scotch
broth
tastes
so
amazingly
delicious
these
days
is
it
possible
that
an
palate
is
more
sensitive
to
culinary
virtues
and
savors
i
must
ask
the
doctor
on
the
little
table
at
my
bedside
lies
the
valdarfer
boccaccio
printed
which
andrews
excellent
fellow
had
bought
at
a
sale
in
my
absence
and
thrice
excellent
fellow
brought
up
for
my
delectation
when
he
came
to
visit
the
sick
i
once
spent
a
delightful
week
in
the
british
museum
virtually
under
guard
examining
that
rare
and
beautiful
volume
now
its
only
replica
in
america
is
near
me
and
i
ought
to
be
feasting
all
my
senses
upon
its
richness
and
beauty
it
was
once
the
property
of
a
medici
and
has
delighted
the
hours
of
popes
princes
dukes
lords
men
have
longed
for
it
have
treasured
it
loved
it
as
men
treasure
and
love
diamonds
or
women
it
is
worth
a
moderate
fortune
but
i
leave
it
neglected
i
am
waiting
for
the
rattle
of
a
tray
and
the
entrance
of
the
girl
behind
the
tray
what
would
rosenbach
or
any
decent
bookman
say
if
they
knew
but
i
care
boccaccio
himself
would
have
approved
me
alicia
enters
and
the
room
is
flooded
with
sunshine
and
i
am
quick
with
life
why
uncle
ranny
alicia
pauses
alarmed
tray
in
hand
do
you
think
you
have
fever
again
your
eyes
are
so
bright
better
to
see
you
with
said
the
wolf
i
mutter
and
turn
away
and
your
cheeks
are
red
she
puts
down
the
tray
ignoring
my
nonsense
let
me
feel
if
they
are
hot
she
persists
anxiously
and
her
cool
fingers
barely
touch
my
cheek
which
i
hastily
draw
aside
i
have
no
fever
i
tell
you
alicia
i
murmur
irritably
i
am
ravenous
food
is
my
craving
sit
down
and
let
me
eat
very
well
dear
grouchy
uncle
ranny
answers
alicia
cheerfully
placing
my
dishes
on
the
table
suspended
over
the
counterpane
and
leaving
her
own
on
the
tray
it
shall
eat
to
its
content
it
nice
chop
and
this
lovely
muffin
and
this
luscious
its
little
fisteses
up
to
its
little
wristeses
the
dirty
little
beasteses
whereupon
i
am
in
good
humor
again
have
you
looked
over
this
valdarfer
boccaccio
at
all
asks
alicia
lightly
by
way
of
making
conversation
i
nod
it
a
love
i
nod
again
what
a
history
that
book
has
you
know
every
detail
of
it
i
suppose
all
the
princes
and
kings
who
owned
the
romance
it
has
accumulated
in
nearly
five
hundred
you
i
what
know
about
it
oh
yes
look
here
cries
alicia
with
mock
anger
you
go
and
become
a
blatant
materialist
thinking
only
of
money
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
that
would
be
horrible
uncle
been
adoring
you
so
abjectly
because
even
your
business
is
lovely
and
intellectual
and
romantic
and
that
girl
is
betrothed
to
my
nephew
randolph
flashes
through
my
mind
aloud
i
say
with
a
faint
grin
meant
to
exasperate
her
who
on
earth
cares
for
anything
but
money
that
she
very
properly
ignores
and
in
a
softer
more
serious
tone
she
murmurs
i
came
across
a
little
rhyme
of
do
you
remember
it
great
scale
the
index
never
rests
you
must
either
rise
or
sink
rule
and
win
or
serve
and
lose
suffer
or
triumph
be
anvil
or
it
lovely
yes
did
you
translate
that
in
your
head
as
you
went
along
i
ask
yes
uncle
you
have
triumphed
over
wisdom
you
have
always
triumphed
even
when
you
have
always
been
you
through
all
your
and
you
know
how
i
too
lived
through
all
those
when
i
was
a
child
and
hardly
dared
to
speak
to
was
oh
so
so
glad
when
you
seemed
to
be
happy
and
even
been
so
wonderful
to
watch
you
the
tears
fill
her
eyes
and
she
turns
her
face
from
me
been
my
life
you
little
witch
my
heart
cries
out
dumbly
in
a
very
ache
of
tenderness
and
have
you
been
mothering
me
in
your
thoughts
all
these
years
as
you
have
mothered
the
children
no
triumphed
i
whisper
huskily
but
i
am
triumphing
now
she
turns
toward
me
again
with
a
smile
of
misty
radiance
by
an
effort
i
control
my
voice
and
launch
out
briskly
did
i
ever
tell
you
alicia
how
i
nearly
owned
the
priceless
copy
of
his
essays
that
bacon
inscribed
and
gave
to
shakespeare
i
am
well
therefore
solitary
it
is
little
enough
i
have
seen
of
my
nephew
randolph
during
my
illness
and
little
that
alicia
has
seen
of
her
fiancé
this
being
a
saturday
when
randolph
is
at
home
alicia
stopped
him
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
house
to
go
to
new
york
on
business
as
my
conditioned
sophomore
put
it
and
firmly
proposed
a
walk
with
her
instead
he
demurred
the
egregious
whelp
demurred
to
a
walk
with
alicia
i
surprised
a
note
that
was
almost
pleading
beneath
the
bright
pleading
to
be
taken
for
a
walk
i
could
have
trounced
the
boy
in
my
hot
indignation
they
saw
them
depart
they
were
in
the
obscure
little
hall
and
my
door
was
open
alicia
waved
her
hand
smiling
just
a
wee
bit
walk
she
called
out
in
language
she
could
not
have
known
the
tug
of
longing
and
envy
with
which
my
heart
and
spirit
followed
her
as
my
body
felt
suddenly
and
disconsolately
heavy
against
the
chair
have
a
good
time
i
waved
my
hand
back
and
greet
the
spring
for
me
the
birds
are
reappearing
and
an
enterprising
family
of
wrens
are
already
building
urgently
over
my
window
robins
are
courting
and
strutting
the
trees
are
tender
with
leaf
and
the
throb
of
spring
is
in
the
air
like
a
mighty
force
ceaseless
slow
careless
yet
the
morning
sun
was
bathing
all
the
world
in
the
very
elixir
of
youth
a
fly
was
buzzing
madly
against
the
pane
i
felt
intensely
solitary
poignantly
alone
the
valdarfer
boccaccio
lay
opened
on
my
he
was
four
and
a
half
centuries
removed
from
this
sunlight
i
almost
hated
all
the
beloved
objects
about
me
my
precious
books
were
dumb
inert
a
clog
upon
all
the
senses
with
a
heart
passionately
hungry
i
craved
for
youth
freshness
activity
i
seized
the
valdarfer
boccaccio
as
though
to
hurl
it
from
me
then
restraining
myself
i
brought
it
down
on
the
table
with
a
bang
that
nearly
shattered
its
precious
binding
i
laughed
ruefully
i
determined
on
a
sudden
to
greet
the
spring
for
myself
griselda
came
bustling
as
she
heard
me
rattling
the
canes
in
the
jar
going
out
she
demanded
yes
griselda
i
am
always
a
little
apologetic
with
griselda
for
did
she
not
know
me
as
a
boy
it
is
a
part
of
the
instinctive
clutching
at
youth
that
makes
us
respect
our
elders
that
puts
them
at
once
in
their
own
elderly
world
besides
griselda
is
always
in
the
right
then
why
did
ye
not
go
with
the
bairns
want
anybody
with
them
and
i
winked
can
wink
at
griselda
has
she
not
spent
her
life
serving
me
in
this
rare
world
you
can
do
anything
to
people
who
love
you
enough
havers
muttered
griselda
with
an
enigmatic
toss
of
her
old
head
then
see
that
ye
take
your
light
coat
a
coat
i
protested
coat
young
man
call
me
young
man
again
and
don
goloshes
and
fur
mittens
i
challenged
her
child
i
should
have
called
ye
murmured
griselda
fumbling
at
the
hook
upon
which
my
top
coat
hung
put
on
rubber
boots
and
a
for
that
i
told
her
and
struggled
into
the
sleeves
as
she
held
the
garment
out
for
me
i
wouldna
go
too
far
cautioned
griselda
not
over
strong
yet
just
a
little
way
i
mumbled
ashamed
at
her
affection
and
care
for
one
so
worthless
thank
you
griselda
she
would
have
been
shocked
and
scandalized
had
she
known
that
at
that
moment
there
was
a
moderate
lump
in
my
throat
and
that
i
all
but
kissed
her
brown
old
face
how
much
the
spring
had
advanced
during
my
days
of
imprisonment
the
grasses
were
assertively
green
as
though
they
had
never
been
otherwise
birds
were
twittering
neighbors
or
opulent
gardeners
were
busy
at
their
flower
beds
and
early
blooms
in
some
of
them
transplanted
from
boxes
or
hyacinths
daffodils
cried
forth
their
beauties
in
a
way
to
make
my
breath
catch
queer
hungering
clamorous
sensations
stirred
in
my
emaciated
frame
how
well
i
understood
at
that
instant
unshed
tears
of
the
heart
when
he
sang
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
la
vie
est
la
simple
et
tranquille
cette
paisible
vient
de
la
ville
tu
fait
o
toi
que
voila
pleurant
sans
cesse
dis
fait
toi
que
voila
de
ta
jeunesse
that
bitterly
anguished
cry
of
the
heart
what
have
you
made
of
your
youth
i
strode
on
grimly
in
a
sort
of
nameless
anger
past
the
outlying
houses
past
empty
lots
with
rank
grass
still
awaiting
the
pressure
of
habitation
until
the
futilely
streets
empty
of
all
life
gave
way
to
open
country
and
meadowland
i
was
making
my
way
to
the
wood
that
lies
between
the
meadows
a
skirting
dairy
farm
or
two
some
scraggy
orchard
here
and
there
and
the
great
line
of
the
aqueduct
the
most
roman
of
our
enterprises
that
carries
the
water
to
new
york
in
the
wood
i
somehow
felt
i
should
be
taken
again
to
the
bosom
of
earth
and
the
sickness
of
my
soul
be
healed
i
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
it
was
radiant
with
dazzling
white
clouds
that
made
my
eyes
water
a
merry
breeze
fanned
the
newborn
earth
and
once
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
i
caught
that
indescribable
whisper
of
trees
which
to
me
is
the
the
speech
and
intimation
of
the
planet
that
at
all
hazards
life
must
go
on
that
it
is
decreed
irresistible
and
sweet
a
pang
of
envy
stabbed
my
breast
at
the
thought
of
the
lovers
abroad
even
though
those
lovers
were
almost
my
children
i
for
one
find
it
difficult
to
keep
apart
those
conflicting
emotions
of
the
heart
but
do
parents
of
the
flesh
i
wonder
encounter
no
similar
struggles
once
among
the
trees
i
was
permeated
by
that
type
of
gentle
melancholy
serenity
that
woods
induce
softly
i
strolled
about
on
last
pine
needles
and
leaves
sodden
now
after
a
snowfall
and
a
rains
the
tread
of
your
primeval
aborigine
returns
even
to
your
civilized
boots
in
the
woods
of
westermain
the
stalker
and
the
hunter
throbs
faintly
in
your
blood
my
path
led
me
up
a
slope
where
the
trees
youngish
still
like
myself
were
no
saplings
however
but
towered
in
a
slender
abandon
toward
the
patches
of
cerulean
sky
overhead
they
seemed
to
escort
me
those
tapering
maples
and
sycamores
with
their
feathery
foliage
like
a
troop
of
young
monks
still
fresh
from
their
novitiate
still
full
of
the
sap
of
life
somehow
trees
in
a
forest
have
always
reminded
me
of
monks
chanting
litanies
and
benedictions
the
of
all
their
murmurings
is
invariably
so
solemn
from
the
crest
the
land
drops
in
a
declivity
and
thence
soon
abandoning
the
woodland
in
a
fringe
of
bushes
and
underbrush
rolls
on
to
the
massive
moundlike
line
of
the
aqueduct
on
a
sudden
i
heard
voices
beneath
me
a
little
way
down
the
declivity
and
peering
down
with
the
delicious
thrill
of
alertness
that
returns
from
primitive
ages
even
among
trees
i
perceived
alicia
and
randolph
with
their
backs
to
me
in
earnest
colloquy
my
first
impulse
naturally
was
to
hail
them
or
to
make
some
sort
of
monitory
sound
that
might
apprise
them
of
my
presence
but
a
sudden
movement
of
arrested
all
force
or
motion
on
my
part
her
hands
shot
forward
and
with
a
vehemence
that
was
obviously
not
loverlike
she
cried
out
in
a
tormented
voice
but
promised
me
that
over
and
over
again
how
many
times
unconsciously
shook
him
as
she
spoke
how
many
times
do
you
suppose
you
have
promised
me
that
you
drink
and
give
up
going
about
with
that
leave
it
altogether
how
many
many
times
she
reiterated
with
a
pathetic
note
of
indignation
a
fellow
quit
cold
like
that
i
barely
heard
the
lad
got
to
have
some
friends
friends
alicia
cried
in
a
voice
of
bitter
exasperation
do
you
call
billy
banning
and
tertius
cullen
and
arthur
bloodgood
friends
your
worst
criminals
and
on
a
sudden
i
realized
that
i
was
an
eavesdropper
and
a
flush
of
shame
heated
my
cheeks
i
was
about
to
make
a
sound
but
my
throat
was
dry
and
no
sound
came
think
what
it
would
mean
took
up
alicia
if
uncle
ranny
found
it
and
i
could
not
choose
but
all
that
he
has
been
to
and
mother
and
everything
else
everything
in
the
world
he
has
given
up
for
us
she
cried
with
quivering
lips
her
voice
thinning
with
passionate
anguish
his
comfort
his
leisure
his
whole
life
he
has
sacrificed
with
a
smile
for
you
and
jimmie
and
laura
even
me
oh
you
suppose
there
are
many
such
men
in
the
world
and
you
want
to
break
his
heart
by
drinking
and
gambling
and
heaven
knows
what
else
it
might
lead
to
i
write
these
words
with
shame
i
had
no
business
to
hear
them
i
gathered
my
arrested
forces
to
compel
myself
to
move
away
when
i
heard
the
bass
mutter
i
know
rotten
as
they
make
give
me
another
chance
one
more
tell
you
yes
was
the
bitter
interruption
you
made
me
those
promises
when
i
said
i
would
be
engaged
to
have
they
amounted
to
it
would
have
broken
his
heart
if
it
had
come
out
then
promised
the
dean
for
her
voice
charged
with
emotion
so
she
could
scarcely
and
but
the
boy
suddenly
drew
her
to
him
with
passionate
earnestness
by
both
hands
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
this
time
different
it
for
it
is
it
for
what
you
for
anything
you
can
think
of
it
is
for
a
purpose
he
explained
with
great
a
tell
but
you
must
tell
me
insisted
alicia
searching
his
eyes
tremulously
he
shook
his
head
vehemently
darling
be
good
to
me
i
must
have
it
if
i
only
had
about
fifty
dollars
i
could
win
am
awfully
good
at
can
bluff
the
lot
of
but
got
to
have
ten
to
i
promise
word
of
honor
never
play
of
honor
it
was
too
late
now
for
me
to
betray
my
presence
i
was
contemptible
in
my
own
eyes
ashamed
yet
hardly
knew
what
my
frame
shook
with
a
cold
rage
with
shame
at
my
blindness
and
yet
a
curious
sense
of
vast
illumination
surrounded
me
like
an
atmosphere
i
moved
away
hardly
knowing
or
caring
whether
i
made
any
sound
and
with
bowed
head
and
a
tumult
throbbing
hot
and
cold
within
me
i
walked
down
the
slope
through
the
still
whispering
woods
what
i
had
long
fitfully
suspected
was
how
somewhat
darkly
apparent
in
some
manner
alicia
was
endeavoring
to
stand
between
the
boy
and
evil
shame
disgrace
sacrificing
herself
deliberately
resolutely
without
a
word
to
it
might
break
my
heart
through
an
empty
barren
landscape
with
unseeing
eyes
conscious
only
of
a
welter
of
incoherent
thoughts
and
emotions
as
though
boiling
in
a
vacuum
i
made
my
way
homeward
it
might
break
my
heart
and
did
ye
walk
too
far
griselda
came
hurriedly
to
the
entrance
hall
when
she
heard
me
greatest
walk
of
my
life
i
laughed
absently
into
her
face
feel
like
another
man
she
scrutinized
me
sharply
for
an
instant
and
muttering
something
about
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
a
biscuit
whisked
away
to
the
kitchen
dumb
distraught
i
fell
wearily
into
my
chair
gazing
vacantly
at
the
rows
of
books
at
the
telephone
instrument
the
safe
the
furniture
and
cushions
at
all
the
apparatus
of
living
about
me
realizing
clearly
only
one
thing
that
it
is
the
simple
basal
things
of
life
that
alone
tend
to
elude
one
for
years
i
had
been
clinging
to
them
faint
but
pursuing
but
still
they
were
eluding
me
still
i
was
a
groping
elementary
learner
in
life
rage
and
depreciate
myself
as
i
would
i
felt
nevertheless
that
i
was
facing
a
problem
momentarily
beyond
me
but
which
i
urgently
knew
i
must
solve
if
i
had
been
blind
i
could
not
continue
blind
suddenly
thought
suspended
as
a
bird
sometimes
hangs
in
the
air
i
seemed
to
be
watching
instinct
taking
command
instinct
overriding
thought
and
shame
rage
and
taking
a
pen
and
a
cheque
book
and
writing
with
my
hand
a
check
in
name
for
fifty
dollars
why
was
my
hand
doing
this
a
slight
tremor
of
revulsion
shook
me
before
this
trivial
deed
i
made
a
movement
as
though
to
destroy
the
cheque
i
had
written
but
i
did
not
destroy
it
i
sat
gazing
at
it
stupidly
as
one
might
sit
before
a
puzzle
griselda
at
this
point
entered
with
a
tray
bearing
cocoa
and
biscuits
oh
thanks
griselda
i
murmured
as
one
emerging
from
a
trance
by
the
way
i
wish
you
mention
to
alicia
my
having
walked
this
morning
griselda
uttered
a
brief
laugh
did
ye
see
them
she
queried
abruptly
see
them
i
repeated
dully
what
a
question
for
you
to
ask
griselda
if
i
had
seen
them
would
i
ask
you
not
to
mention
it
oh
am
a
fool
muttered
griselda
slowly
turning
to
leave
me
but
her
expression
was
not
that
of
one
chastened
in
her
folly
is
jimmie
in
the
house
i
asked
no
jimmie
is
across
the
way
playing
with
the
sturgis
boy
very
well
griselda
thank
you
a
few
minutes
later
alicia
entered
the
i
rose
heavily
and
walked
toward
the
open
door
leading
to
the
hallway
her
drooping
dispirited
look
struck
me
like
a
radiant
alicia
even
her
pretty
small
hat
that
i
admired
seemed
to
squat
listlessly
upon
her
beautiful
even
in
dejection
but
no
sooner
did
she
perceive
me
approaching
than
she
looked
up
and
smiled
piteously
oh
hello
uncle
but
the
usual
sparkle
in
her
tone
was
sadly
have
you
been
all
right
she
removed
her
hat
oh
alicia
but
a
little
lonely
you
come
in
and
talk
to
me
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
of
course
i
shall
you
poor
uncle
and
her
tone
became
more
hearty
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
all
and
i
realized
that
endearments
were
trembling
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
and
my
soul
craved
them
but
i
interrupted
her
she
had
had
enough
that
morning
and
the
endearments
of
pity
would
have
crushed
me
utterly
oh
boccaccio
i
muttered
and
puttering
about
which
an
expert
sit
down
i
added
as
she
entered
the
study
am
i
mistaken
or
did
you
tire
yourself
out
walking
too
far
oh
no
had
a
lovely
walk
she
answered
brightly
you
go
wasting
sympathy
on
me
i
feel
ashamed
of
my
robustiousness
and
you
convalescing
here
alone
but
i
leave
you
alone
again
you
like
me
to
read
some
boccaccio
to
you
then
my
italian
is
so
ferocious
and
yours
is
so
beautiful
hate
me
if
i
clipped
the
vowels
too
short
she
had
thus
far
made
no
mention
of
randolph
so
full
did
my
heart
feel
of
love
and
sympathy
for
this
poor
beautiful
child
struggling
alone
with
her
problem
and
pain
that
i
ached
to
take
her
to
my
heart
to
beg
her
to
confide
in
me
to
let
me
share
her
troubles
a
lump
rose
in
my
throat
and
i
knew
that
one
movement
in
her
direction
would
make
all
my
manhood
dissolve
in
tears
like
a
child
no
i
must
could
not
read
me
i
whispered
huskily
after
a
pause
two
or
three
of
the
sonnets
in
the
of
dante
lovely
cried
alicia
jumping
up
and
seizing
the
book
ciascun
alma
she
to
every
captive
soul
and
gentle
heart
greeting
in
the
name
of
their
lord
who
is
love
i
did
not
listen
after
the
first
stanza
i
endeavored
only
to
still
the
tumult
in
my
brain
and
to
think
what
to
do
for
alicia
somehow
some
way
i
must
put
an
end
at
once
to
this
beloved
causing
her
pain
three
sonnets
she
had
read
or
possibly
four
and
then
she
paused
and
searched
my
face
do
you
want
any
more
thank
you
very
much
alicia
i
feel
brighter
already
i
think
that
will
be
enough
for
by
the
way
alicia
i
went
on
rapidly
fumbling
with
my
papers
it
strikes
me
your
allowance
is
too
small
you
must
need
dozens
and
dozens
of
things
that
cost
money
here
is
a
cheque
for
fifty
dollars
i
wrote
out
this
i
added
half
if
you
need
more
i
can
just
as
easily
make
it
a
hundred
and
i
laughed
a
trifle
i
could
act
this
morning
act
almost
as
well
as
alicia
she
gazed
at
me
intently
for
a
space
silent
flash
of
then
with
an
ineffable
tenderness
and
a
great
relief
shining
in
her
eyes
oh
you
darling
uncle
ranny
she
leaped
from
her
chair
and
flew
toward
me
pressing
both
her
hands
down
on
my
shoulders
immobile
as
a
buddha
i
sat
as
she
kissed
me
on
the
cheek
but
do
you
really
think
you
me
all
this
oh
yes
alicia
i
laughed
with
the
bravado
of
fred
salmon
i
am
quite
sure
i
can
what
are
uncles
for
but
i
could
say
no
more
she
hung
over
me
for
an
instant
and
then
abruptly
left
me
she
too
was
fearful
of
saying
more
but
not
for
the
same
not
for
the
same
reason
all
that
day
alicia
as
i
could
not
help
overhearing
was
vainly
endeavoring
to
reach
randolph
on
the
telephone
in
new
york
she
rang
the
fraternity
house
she
tried
the
homes
of
his
friends
but
all
to
no
purpose
randolph
was
not
to
be
found
and
that
evening
alicia
mounted
the
stairs
to
her
room
with
a
sort
of
drooping
febrile
anxiety
with
an
anxious
unnatural
gayety
only
some
fifteen
hours
have
passed
and
the
world
is
changed
to
a
dazzling
brilliance
alicia
would
not
leave
me
poor
overwrought
child
she
has
refused
to
go
to
bed
and
insisted
upon
staying
near
me
upon
meeting
the
dawn
with
me
she
now
lies
stretched
upon
my
couch
covered
over
with
a
rug
and
she
has
just
been
overtaken
by
slumber
and
her
presence
there
under
my
eyes
randolph
byrd
is
the
nearest
taste
of
heaven
that
you
and
i
have
known
or
possibly
ever
will
know
in
this
life
it
is
dawn
enough
for
me
now
and
for
you
my
dawn
so
resplendent
that
i
for
one
shall
never
desire
a
brighter
and
since
there
can
be
no
more
sleep
for
me
this
night
and
since
this
may
be
the
last
entry
for
you
in
these
memoirs
for
many
a
day
if
not
forever
i
shall
endeavor
to
still
the
flying
heart
the
mad
exultation
rioting
in
my
veins
by
noting
down
for
you
how
sketchily
and
incoherently
soever
the
momentous
occurrences
of
the
youngest
hours
it
came
has
it
come
about
or
is
this
some
mad
dream
from
which
i
shall
wake
to
the
old
somber
reality
how
can
a
dark
turbid
current
so
suddenly
bring
one
out
into
a
flashing
sparkling
sunlit
lagoon
overhung
with
a
verdure
so
rich
and
lustrous
it
would
seem
to
have
come
fresh
from
the
hand
i
hear
birds
piping
in
wondrous
music
or
do
i
imagine
it
but
i
began
by
telling
you
i
should
be
incoherent
it
must
have
been
some
time
past
midnight
when
i
screened
the
fire
put
out
the
lights
and
wearily
in
darkness
made
my
way
up
the
stairs
the
fire
had
unaccountably
and
fitfully
smoked
and
i
remember
the
last
thing
i
did
was
to
take
out
fred
certificates
from
the
safe
examine
them
with
smarting
eyes
and
then
gaze
in
sleepy
astonishment
at
the
quotation
of
salmon
oil
in
the
newspapers
according
to
that
the
shares
were
now
worth
thousand
dollars
it
seemed
incredible
absurd
and
the
year
was
up
and
i
might
sell
the
stuff
like
a
miser
who
has
nothing
else
in
life
to
look
for
i
gazed
spellbound
at
those
securities
in
whose
security
i
even
now
could
not
believe
but
unlike
the
miser
of
fiction
but
like
my
dull
stupid
self
i
neglected
to
replace
the
crackling
papers
though
i
did
put
the
valdarfer
boccaccio
in
and
closed
the
safe
in
the
upper
passageway
i
distinctly
recall
walking
on
tiptoe
so
that
alicia
might
not
be
disturbed
was
it
hallucination
i
wonder
or
did
i
actually
hear
like
a
sighing
whisper
through
the
darkness
good
night
uncle
ranny
i
am
always
imagining
her
voice
and
her
gestures
in
my
brain
i
must
ask
her
when
she
wakes
up
at
any
rate
that
mysterious
whisper
it
was
or
the
hallucination
of
a
whisper
that
stirred
me
into
wakefulness
again
i
began
to
undress
and
paused
realizing
that
i
was
now
too
wakeful
to
sleep
i
donned
a
dressing
gown
over
my
waistcoat
adjusted
the
light
and
lay
down
upon
the
bed
with
fleurs
de
mai
in
my
hand
a
little
of
baudelaire
had
the
effect
upon
my
mind
of
rich
food
upon
a
furred
tongue
why
i
wondered
do
i
keep
that
gloomy
book
upon
my
bedside
table
i
threw
it
down
in
disgust
and
took
up
a
volume
of
montaigne
instead
to
read
and
enjoy
montaigne
is
a
certain
sign
of
middle
age
i
have
long
enjoyed
montaigne
a
french
verse
to
the
effect
that
a
peaceful
indifference
is
the
sagest
of
virtues
came
into
my
head
and
with
sudden
violence
i
threw
away
montaigne
i
was
not
i
was
not
indifferent
the
heart
of
frustrated
youth
in
me
was
crying
out
for
life
and
love
alicia
was
two
doors
away
from
me
she
did
not
love
my
nephew
could
i
not
if
i
plucked
up
energy
and
resolution
make
her
love
me
was
i
then
so
irrevocably
uncle
ranny
i
leaped
up
feverishly
lifted
the
shade
and
looked
out
upon
the
blinking
stars
their
message
was
a
very
simple
one
from
virgo
to
cassiopeia
from
the
pole
star
to
the
farthest
twinkler
they
seemed
to
say
the
trifling
planet
earth
is
you
know
how
to
use
it
with
a
muffled
tread
i
paced
the
room
agitatedly
this
affair
between
alicia
and
randolph
was
absurd
randolph
was
unfit
for
the
very
thought
of
marriage
a
wise
parent
would
know
how
to
deal
with
the
situation
but
alas
i
was
neither
wise
nor
a
parent
nevertheless
i
must
find
a
way
of
liquidating
this
business
not
later
than
it
could
not
go
on
the
lamplight
showed
me
in
my
dull
perplexity
and
i
turned
it
off
angrily
and
again
threw
myself
on
the
bed
to
think
in
egyptian
darkness
on
a
sudden
i
heard
a
low
murmur
of
voices
without
it
is
seldom
that
voices
are
heard
late
at
night
in
our
secluded
situation
possibly
the
policeman
exchanging
comments
on
the
night
with
some
solitary
a
moment
later
however
i
heard
a
key
inserted
in
a
lock
and
a
door
open
my
nephew
randolph
returning
home
at
last
then
would
be
the
same
i
asked
myself
alicia
would
turn
over
the
cheque
to
him
and
all
would
go
on
as
before
no
no
that
could
not
be
yet
what
could
i
do
turn
the
boy
adrift
boy
and
revolt
her
hate
me
what
a
horrible
impasse
i
listened
for
footsteps
on
the
stairs
but
there
was
no
sound
suppose
i
were
to
call
him
into
my
room
and
tell
him
that
i
knew
to
his
better
nature
was
not
that
what
parents
were
obliged
to
do
the
world
over
i
should
talk
tenderly
to
the
in
my
heart
i
own
i
did
not
feel
tenderly
toward
him
still
there
was
no
sound
of
steps
on
the
stairs
the
black
darkness
made
the
tension
of
waiting
intolerable
i
switched
on
the
light
and
automatically
made
toward
the
door
then
all
at
once
the
low
hum
of
voices
overtook
me
had
alicia
descended
to
meet
him
had
not
heard
her
door
surely
randolph
in
his
sober
senses
would
not
bring
friends
of
his
to
the
house
at
this
hour
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
two
noiselessly
i
opened
my
door
and
in
the
soft
moccasin
slippers
i
was
wearing
tiptoed
down
the
hall
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
paused
to
listen
primeval
instincts
of
alertness
stirred
within
me
my
heart
was
throbbing
against
my
throat
and
i
literally
felt
my
eyes
dilating
in
the
darkness
i
found
myself
smiling
at
the
primitive
machinery
that
is
set
in
motion
within
us
slumber
though
it
might
at
the
slightest
provocation
still
treading
softly
i
descended
the
stairs
no
light
was
showing
anywhere
the
darkness
was
absolute
what
under
heaven
could
be
the
meaning
of
that
the
primitive
instinct
of
the
stalker
was
again
to
the
fore
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
paused
sounds
were
audible
they
came
from
my
study
upon
my
word
i
thought
with
indignation
the
young
man
could
not
possibly
be
in
his
right
mind
the
study
door
was
closed
but
through
the
slightest
of
chinks
between
door
and
lintel
left
evidently
to
obviate
the
noise
of
the
clicking
fixture
i
perceived
a
faint
fitful
spot
of
light
flickering
about
like
the
light
of
tinker
bell
in
peter
pan
with
a
slight
pressure
i
pushed
the
door
gently
ajar
randolph
with
a
small
spotlight
in
his
hand
was
standing
at
my
desk
except
for
the
circle
of
light
about
him
the
room
was
in
darkness
the
rim
of
his
hat
shading
his
eyes
he
was
scanning
the
salmon
oil
certificates
with
his
trembling
left
hand
he
was
counting
them
under
the
quivering
spot
of
light
proceeding
from
his
right
i
heard
him
breathe
heavily
a
hundred
each
i
stood
overwhelmed
scarcely
breathing
frozen
with
a
sickening
shame
of
horror
the
meaning
of
it
was
so
crushingly
plain
take
two
of
them
i
heard
a
mysterious
hoarse
whisper
coming
from
the
window
put
the
rest
back
never
miss
all
right
whispered
randolph
with
quaking
huskiness
give
to
me
came
from
the
window
my
power
of
motion
at
that
instant
suddenly
flooded
back
into
my
muscles
i
lifted
my
hand
as
though
fearful
of
rending
the
darkness
pushed
the
inside
the
door
and
the
room
was
bathed
in
light
from
the
single
lamp
on
my
after
the
pregnant
darkness
then
a
vision
that
sent
a
chill
shock
through
my
nerves
and
stunned
all
senses
left
me
in
the
window
was
framed
the
abhorrent
dilapidated
parody
of
the
face
of
pendleton
it
could
not
be
was
the
thought
sluggishly
struggling
through
my
numbed
brain
it
was
a
nightmare
then
a
sudden
sharp
cry
threw
me
into
a
momentary
tremor
i
wheeled
about
alicia
fully
dressed
with
one
hand
to
her
eyes
was
leaning
against
the
doorpost
without
speaking
i
automatically
bounded
forward
to
the
window
the
muffled
sound
of
heavy
steps
running
on
the
turf
fell
upon
my
ears
and
dimly
through
the
starlit
darkness
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
stooping
bulk
of
a
large
man
receding
down
the
slope
toward
the
brook
had
my
senses
been
tricking
me
or
had
i
really
seen
the
face
of
pendleton
who
was
it
i
cried
fiercely
to
randolph
still
hanging
stupefied
and
immobile
with
blank
terror
upon
his
features
over
my
desk
he
made
no
answer
sit
down
over
there
i
commanded
sharply
as
one
under
the
influence
of
a
drug
or
a
hypnotic
spell
the
boy
loosely
moved
to
obey
but
remained
standing
irresolute
at
my
chair
a
mass
of
helplessness
his
head
dropping
limply
on
his
chest
anger
and
pain
struggling
for
mastery
within
me
i
turned
abruptly
to
alicia
you
been
asleep
child
better
go
go
i
entreated
no
i
she
retorted
with
a
cry
of
passionate
vehemence
and
with
a
rush
she
flung
past
me
toward
randolph
so
that
is
what
you
wanted
the
money
for
shook
with
the
fury
of
her
to
give
to
that
brute
and
he
has
got
hold
of
back
to
make
a
thief
of
you
then
it
pendleton
i
was
not
mistaken
why
do
you
suppose
i
engaged
myself
to
you
you
poor
contemptible
weakling
do
you
suppose
i
am
in
love
with
you
her
tears
gushed
forth
and
she
rocked
her
arms
passionately
love
a
thing
like
you
i
wanted
to
keep
your
weakness
and
your
spinelessness
from
uncle
save
him
from
the
pain
he
is
suffering
now
because
a
thief
you
promised
promised
me
over
and
over
keep
and
she
wailed
with
the
anguished
note
that
drags
on
and
this
is
what
got
to
stealing
and
from
uncle
ranny
of
all
people
been
father
and
mother
to
in
the
world
if
i
adore
him
more
than
anybody
on
earth
do
you
think
i
would
have
looked
at
you
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
beat
you
to
a
pulp
she
lifted
her
hands
on
high
and
for
one
fascinated
instant
i
actually
thought
she
would
i
wish
i
could
feel
sure
of
never
seeing
your
face
again
she
concluded
collapsing
with
her
own
anger
slowly
under
the
blows
of
her
words
the
boy
lifted
his
eyes
eyes
smoldering
with
shame
with
abject
misery
with
the
hopeless
pathos
of
the
weak
then
you
never
cared
a
damn
he
muttered
never
cared
a
your
sense
she
cried
forgetting
all
restraint
in
her
passionate
exasperation
and
i
never
can
and
never
will
now
hoped
become
a
man
but
through
with
you
for
good
i
had
been
standing
aside
awed
involuntarily
with
the
aloofness
and
indecision
of
surprise
i
now
made
a
move
toward
alicia
to
lead
her
away
if
i
adore
him
more
than
anybody
on
earth
i
ought
not
to
have
heard
that
but
i
had
and
my
pulses
began
to
throb
anew
a
sudden
loud
rapping
at
the
door
however
startled
us
all
out
of
our
tempest
of
pain
into
a
common
alertness
i
glanced
at
the
huddled
form
of
randolph
at
the
still
quivering
figure
of
alicia
see
who
it
is
i
muttered
moving
toward
the
hall
alicia
stood
for
a
moment
irresolute
and
then
ran
out
behind
me
and
disappeared
in
the
darkened
dining
room
what
it
flashed
through
my
mind
as
i
unlocked
the
door
what
if
pendleton
was
father
of
children
snatched
like
the
thief
he
was
in
his
flight
and
i
felt
the
prickling
sensation
of
sweat
against
my
clothes
as
i
swung
open
the
door
the
mounted
policeman
halloran
was
looming
in
the
doorway
he
was
clutching
by
the
arm
a
hulking
figure
in
a
shabby
top
coat
a
man
a
man
panting
like
a
beast
who
was
shrinkingly
miserably
averting
his
face
from
the
light
i
saw
this
man
running
away
from
your
house
just
now
began
halloran
briskly
mighty
suspicious
he
away
this
hour
of
the
night
picked
him
see
if
they
was
anything
wrong
i
peered
at
the
indistinct
features
of
the
man
it
was
the
dissipated
almost
leprous
face
of
pendleton
with
an
incredible
swiftness
i
felt
my
mental
machinery
working
something
must
be
done
all
hate
of
him
and
all
fear
of
him
vanished
from
my
mind
before
a
faint
lucid
beam
of
a
sort
of
indolent
humor
that
you
jim
i
queried
peering
more
closely
hello
jim
i
greeted
him
in
a
jocund
undertone
bringing
my
voice
round
with
a
great
effort
to
a
pitch
of
naturalness
no
officer
i
went
on
glibly
nothing
wrong
this
man
was
here
on
a
business
matter
left
late
running
for
a
train
i
you
jim
yes
came
hoarsely
from
pendleton
and
a
quiver
of
triumph
ran
down
my
spine
be
a
i
fumbled
the
policeman
glanced
quizzically
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
then
shrewdly
interposed
train
to
at
no
use
running
he
grinned
my
ear
hypersensitive
at
that
moment
seemed
still
to
catch
a
note
of
doubt
in
the
zealous
voice
and
when
i
longed
to
fling
out
in
the
words
of
the
he
is
either
a
devil
frae
hell
or
else
his
mother
a
witch
maun
be
i
heard
myself
saying
calmly
thank
you
officer
then
to
pendleton
you
want
to
come
in
and
spend
the
night
after
all
jim
no
i
better
go
mumbled
pendleton
edging
away
sorry
to
have
troubled
you
gentlemen
apologized
halloran
suavely
but
you
many
robberies
in
the
is
to
look
out
extry
sharp
good
night
to
ye
byrd
good
night
sir
he
nodded
with
contempt
at
pendleton
good
night
muttered
pendleton
and
slouched
off
heavily
down
the
gravel
path
no
harm
done
grinned
halloran
looking
queerly
after
his
recent
prisoner
but
i
could
have
i
interrupted
him
with
a
boisterous
laugh
not
at
all
officer
sorry
you
had
the
thanks
for
your
watchfulness
see
you
all
right
he
responded
with
smart
alacrity
good
night
sir
i
closed
the
door
in
the
room
the
lad
randolph
sat
alone
somewhat
straighter
now
gazing
before
him
he
must
have
heard
the
colloquy
at
the
door
well
randolph
i
approached
him
quietly
now
what
do
you
want
to
say
to
me
he
did
not
answer
for
a
space
finally
he
spoke
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
uncle
ranny
my
anger
against
him
had
subsided
i
saw
only
the
frail
young
mortal
son
whom
i
had
undertaken
to
make
a
man
i
had
failed
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
with
you
i
queried
gently
there
was
no
longer
even
rancor
in
my
heart
put
me
away
i
guess
he
answered
dully
what
i
deserve
when
did
you
first
meet
father
i
found
myself
wincing
at
the
word
but
after
all
pendleton
his
father
about
three
weeks
ago
was
the
reply
how
did
it
happen
he
came
here
and
followed
and
me
to
town
one
morning
on
the
train
he
watched
for
me
till
i
came
out
of
lecture
and
then
he
spoke
to
me
what
did
he
say
oh
asked
whether
forgotten
him
took
me
to
lunch
and
told
me
you
gave
him
a
rotten
his
children
away
from
him
into
exile
and
so
on
he
tell
you
that
he
deserted
your
mother
and
you
three
children
and
that
your
mother
died
of
it
no
said
randolph
wearily
but
i
knew
that
oh
you
think
i
took
to
him
right
off
the
bat
he
tell
you
that
he
went
away
of
his
own
a
horrible
scene
alicia
i
felt
the
truth
must
be
told
the
boy
now
he
tell
you
that
i
gave
him
money
to
go
and
that
only
recently
i
sent
him
more
money
to
san
francisco
because
he
wanted
to
get
back
to
the
east
no
said
the
boy
in
amazement
he
said
you
had
taken
everything
from
him
because
of
the
mistake
tried
to
keep
him
down
what
first
began
to
get
me
oh
the
use
uncle
ranny
a
hard
thing
to
say
but
i
guess
pretty
rotten
even
if
he
is
my
father
he
got
me
drunk
to
do
he
waved
his
hand
heavily
toward
the
desk
said
there
was
some
island
found
where
he
wanted
to
raise
copra
or
cocoanuts
or
his
he
only
had
a
little
the
use
uncle
ranny
he
went
on
in
the
same
weary
tones
through
with
him
i
care
a
curse
about
him
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
a
great
tenderness
for
the
boy
stabbed
at
my
heart
i
longed
to
comfort
him
as
i
could
comfort
laura
or
jimmie
was
he
not
their
brother
and
as
much
as
they
my
child
like
a
disease
misfortune
and
dishonor
had
suddenly
attacked
him
my
breast
was
simmering
with
bitter
come
randolph
i
put
my
arm
about
his
shoulder
pull
yourself
together
we
must
live
this
business
down
your
education
to
be
thought
of
you
must
finish
you
see
you
give
me
another
chance
yes
randolph
i
answered
huskily
and
still
another
at
that
moment
i
felt
i
could
have
given
him
seven
well
then
he
answered
with
the
first
gleam
of
interest
i
discerned
in
him
will
you
let
me
go
ahead
and
enlist
enlist
i
recoiled
from
that
in
the
army
you
mean
you
are
so
young
i
mean
in
the
want
to
do
it
uncle
must
do
the
only
way
i
can
begin
again
i
stay
round
where
alicia
is
my
heart
went
utterly
out
to
the
boy
in
his
misery
i
knew
not
what
to
say
to
him
the
pangs
of
despised
love
alicia
has
been
but
it
was
futile
to
talk
to
him
of
alicia
go
to
bed
my
boy
i
said
gently
urging
him
toward
the
door
get
some
rest
and
still
your
poor
nerves
we
shall
discuss
and
settle
this
matter
in
your
best
interests
remember
you
are
surrounded
by
your
friends
with
a
faint
gleam
of
gratitude
in
his
eyes
he
shuffled
out
unsteadily
and
i
pressed
his
hand
as
we
parted
at
the
door
i
heard
him
moving
about
in
his
room
then
i
realized
that
i
must
find
alicia
treading
speedily
with
a
strange
lightness
of
step
i
mounted
the
stairs
first
to
see
whether
alicia
might
have
returned
to
her
room
as
was
natural
and
found
her
door
ajar
and
the
apartment
empty
my
brain
still
wheeling
i
seemed
to
float
dawn
the
stairway
and
into
the
dining
room
but
no
one
was
there
somewhat
uneasily
i
passed
through
the
narrow
pantry
into
the
kitchen
and
there
the
door
that
gave
on
the
garden
stood
open
wide
in
the
shadow
under
the
starlit
sky
under
the
mystical
blue
of
overhanging
boughs
stood
alicia
alone
gazing
into
the
velvety
night
straight
as
a
silvery
diana
mysterious
tragic
at
the
sight
of
her
the
mad
tumult
of
the
evening
seemed
to
ooze
away
from
me
in
waves
by
an
effort
of
will
i
forced
my
heart
to
beat
more
soberly
as
i
approached
her
softly
alicia
i
whispered
behind
her
so
as
not
to
startle
her
slowly
she
turned
toward
me
her
face
was
but
dimly
discernible
but
her
eyes
shone
in
the
night
with
the
brightness
of
the
stars
the
one
thought
of
my
heart
was
to
bring
alicia
back
to
the
life
of
the
past
to
wipe
out
as
swiftly
as
possible
the
ravages
of
the
emotional
storm
to
bring
her
back
to
the
tranquil
blissful
life
that
her
happy
presence
made
for
me
a
sad
alicia
was
unthinkable
you
must
come
in
my
child
i
touched
her
gently
i
have
tried
so
hard
uncle
ranny
she
turned
her
face
and
laid
a
hand
timidly
upon
my
arm
i
have
tried
so
hard
to
keep
all
this
pain
from
that
you
could
go
on
being
your
happy
lovely
self
my
own
thoughts
concerning
her
she
was
giving
them
back
to
the
poignant
wistful
gloom
the
intense
pathos
of
the
young
that
is
so
touching
in
the
young
you
love
so
lacerating
did
i
ever
say
that
there
are
no
women
who
wear
the
hair
shirt
like
the
radiant
girl
wife
of
jacopone
da
todi
blind
fool
that
i
have
been
but
my
darling
girl
i
seized
both
her
cold
little
hands
worry
about
me
i
am
old
and
to
the
fortunes
of
to
the
misfortunes
too
it
is
sad
very
sad
but
it
is
nothing
you
i
am
thinking
of
things
happen
my
dear
life
is
like
that
there
is
a
lot
of
happiness
and
serenity
in
it
but
you
must
not
let
this
bite
into
your
will
pass
has
passed
already
i
want
you
to
return
to
your
happy
blissful
self
that
has
made
of
very
happy
i
ask
nothing
more
or
better
uncle
ranny
she
pressed
my
hands
with
quick
intense
little
movements
than
to
be
near
you
to
work
and
serve
is
all
i
ask
in
the
world
almost
i
had
committed
the
unpardonable
i
had
taken
advantage
of
her
mood
and
of
her
grief
taken
her
to
my
heart
and
poured
out
the
words
of
love
that
a
hundred
hundred
times
had
overflowed
my
heart
and
clamored
for
utterance
a
pretty
head
of
a
family
a
fine
protector
of
the
young
i
should
then
have
been
with
a
tremulous
movement
i
put
both
her
hands
together
between
my
own
and
whispered
to
her
lest
my
voice
should
betray
me
that
is
exactly
what
i
want
you
to
do
my
dearest
quietly
and
happily
near
me
be
happy
until
supreme
happiness
comes
to
i
added
with
a
painful
laugh
the
prince
in
the
fairy
claim
you
it
was
the
hardest
utterance
of
my
life
but
i
felt
a
flash
of
triumph
to
have
uttered
it
the
prince
in
the
fairy
tale
alicia
repeated
slowly
looking
rapt
before
her
he
came
long
have
had
more
than
i
much
so
much
that
i
often
tremble
to
think
of
it
all
the
prince
and
all
the
fairy
tale
i
want
or
shall
ever
want
for
one
instant
i
thrilled
from
head
to
foot
a
darkness
filled
my
being
for
a
moment
and
then
it
was
rayed
and
forked
by
the
lightnings
of
a
strange
intoxication
you
mean
alicia
i
breathed
huskily
from
a
parched
throat
it
is
and
i
knew
instantaneously
that
all
the
restraint
and
resolutions
had
been
swept
after
all
i
was
as
weak
and
weaker
than
the
boy
randolph
for
i
had
spoken
without
the
iota
of
a
wish
to
resist
my
desires
slowly
very
slowly
she
drew
closer
to
me
so
that
her
sweet
breath
of
violets
was
warm
and
fragrant
on
my
cheek
my
head
swam
ever
since
i
came
to
you
she
breathed
ever
so
softly
ever
since
i
was
fifteen
you
have
filled
my
thoughts
my
heart
my
life
i
you
always
the
blood
roared
in
my
ears
i
was
filled
with
madness
but
too
long
had
i
doubted
happiness
to
receive
it
with
open
arms
i
had
made
a
stranger
of
it
as
does
a
miser
by
keeping
his
wealth
hidden
away
think
what
you
are
saying
alicia
i
took
her
face
convulsively
in
both
my
hands
i
have
loved
you
beyond
anything
on
earth
beyond
life
itself
i
have
dreamed
of
you
dwelt
upon
you
until
i
am
mad
do
you
really
mean
you
can
love
a
man
after
all
those
foolish
years
of
hiding
and
suffering
is
that
what
you
mean
or
is
it
ranny
is
what
i
mean
my
prince
of
the
fairy
tale
she
whispered
hiding
her
face
against
if
take
me
my
senses
reeled
and
swooned
she
was
tightly
gripped
in
my
arms
i
was
straining
her
to
my
heart
the
months
the
years
of
love
hunger
charged
through
my
veins
and
sinews
like
an
inexorable
force
remorseless
irresistible
the
margin
of
the
garden
was
a
few
yards
away
but
it
might
have
been
an
infinity
the
scant
trees
countable
upon
the
fingers
of
one
hand
might
have
been
a
forest
of
congregated
giants
with
their
vast
secret
life
brooding
and
sheltering
us
infinity
and
our
small
intense
reality
were
merged
and
met
i
felt
coextensive
with
the
vast
majestic
universe
i
babbled
broken
words
against
her
know
what
i
babbled
for
the
vast
majestic
universe
was
locked
in
the
circle
of
my
arms
let
us
go
in
my
darling
i
murmured
at
last
the
dew
is
heavy
and
you
must
get
your
rest
i
shall
not
attempt
to
sleep
what
remains
of
this
night
of
nights
nor
i
replied
alicia
dreamily
i
want
to
meet
the
dawn
with
you
this
morning
it
marvelous
dearest
that
in
spite
of
everything
in
spite
of
that
poor
boy
in
there
she
added
with
a
note
of
pathos
we
two
can
be
so
wildly
happy
yes
my
child
marvelous
and
but
happiness
is
the
first
foremost
law
i
shall
never
be
as
wise
as
you
uncle
ranny
she
laughed
softly
lingering
in
my
arms
there
i
have
called
you
uncle
ranny
again
i
am
so
afraid
i
shall
always
call
you
that
i
sealed
her
lips
oh
if
that
is
all
afraid
of
i
murmured
in
the
tone
of
devout
thanksgiving
if
that
is
us
go
in
my
own
and
now
alicia
is
waiting
to
meet
the
dawn
with
me
up
up
heart
of
my
heart
star
of
my
life
happiness
nearer
to
me
than
my
own
soul
or
i
shall
deify
you
in
my
mad
folly
up
up
my
the
dawn
is
breaking
i
have
been
sitting
in
the
shade
of
a
trellis
watching
the
miraculously
mobile
suspension
of
a
humming
bird
over
a
cluster
of
honeysuckle
blooms
that
humming
bird
whorl
of
triumphant
aspiration
that
it
of
insect
to
become
in
a
manner
to
embody
my
life
story
for
the
humming
bird
the
golden
age
is
this
perfect
summer
day
with
its
tendril
and
leaf
its
beds
of
bleeding
heart
and
bridal
wreath
sweet
william
larkspur
and
marigold
and
the
heavy
fragrant
breath
of
honeysuckle
and
so
it
is
for
me
also
no
fable
is
deadlier
to
the
human
race
to
human
weal
and
human
hope
than
that
same
fable
of
the
golden
age
there
never
was
an
age
one
half
so
golden
as
the
now
nor
the
infinitesimalest
part
so
golden
as
the
ages
that
await
us
my
son
there
sleeping
in
his
hammock
under
the
tree
overhung
by
fine
netting
randolph
byrd
the
younger
will
see
a
more
wondrous
human
life
than
any
we
have
yet
beheld
two
years
and
more
have
passed
since
i
have
opened
this
record
of
yours
randolph
the
aged
and
i
open
it
now
with
a
purpose
for
a
special
and
peculiar
reason
alicia
has
chanced
to
see
it
and
she
fell
upon
it
with
a
me
she
desires
me
to
round
it
off
as
she
puts
it
to
disguise
it
a
trifle
here
and
there
as
to
names
and
places
and
to
publish
it
for
the
edification
of
mankind
if
only
we
could
appear
to
the
world
in
the
stature
loving
eyes
see
us
but
laugh
as
i
will
at
alicia
she
persists
obstinately
in
her
wish
but
it
was
only
meant
as
a
memoir
for
a
friend
of
mine
i
tell
her
who
is
daily
growing
nearer
to
randolph
byrd
aged
seventy
oh
no
cries
alicia
looking
with
eyes
shining
with
happiness
and
a
face
suddenly
thrillingly
transfigured
at
the
sleeping
baby
in
the
hammock
it
is
meant
for
another
the
young
over
there
the
pride
and
joy
of
his
hope
of
the
world
it
will
hardly
amuse
him
i
grunt
it
it
griselda
says
alicia
to
our
aged
friend
who
at
this
moment
emerges
from
the
kitchen
to
consult
with
her
mistress
griselda
looks
mystified
say
for
baby
urges
alicia
cunningly
oh
good
for
the
bairn
say
it
griselda
still
vigorous
goes
her
way
one
would
think
i
scoff
you
had
found
in
the
manuscript
all
the
jests
of
sancho
panza
falling
like
drops
of
rain
jests
mocks
alicia
who
cares
about
jests
but
the
mysterious
readers
of
comic
supplements
i
find
in
it
the
record
of
a
beautiful
love
but
even
love
birds
i
tease
are
only
a
species
of
many
think
birds
of
paradise
besides
i
urge
i
should
have
to
call
the
thing
a
this
is
only
a
fragment
of
life
seen
through
two
particular
eyes
and
a
very
peculiar
temperament
there
is
no
contour
to
it
any
more
than
there
is
to
life
itself
were
i
a
novelist
my
dearest
i
should
not
improbably
make
two
or
three
novels
of
the
stuff
i
should
at
least
assume
the
jolly
privilege
of
playing
destiny
to
all
those
people
all
things
and
all
persons
should
be
rhythmically
accounted
for
fudge
says
alicia
be
so
cubist
i
ignore
her
modernism
pendleton
would
not
be
left
roaming
about
the
world
with
endless
possibility
of
still
blackmailing
me
and
his
children
should
he
not
have
ended
his
existence
on
the
third
rail
as
he
ran
the
night
of
his
last
appearance
and
his
son
he
not
have
met
with
a
heroic
and
glorious
end
in
france
or
at
sea
instead
of
living
a
highly
contented
and
commonplace
life
with
the
pretty
irish
peasant
girl
he
has
brought
from
mere
ordinary
decent
automobile
salesman
would
those
people
go
on
living
in
the
unremarkable
flowing
manner
of
life
no
my
heart
i
continue
soberly
a
story
must
be
tricked
and
padded
with
tracery
and
decoration
and
where
is
the
bevy
of
young
adventuresses
at
which
no
novel
is
worthy
of
the
name
in
justice
to
alicia
however
i
must
recall
that
gertrude
of
all
the
others
has
emerged
true
to
her
form
she
carries
i
believe
besides
the
military
title
of
major
a
decoration
from
every
allied
nation
in
europe
and
at
least
two
bestowed
by
reigning
sovereigns
she
drove
out
here
in
her
handsome
car
to
see
us
the
other
day
and
was
much
amazed
by
the
sight
of
my
infant
son
what
ranny
she
exclaimed
with
her
usual
freedom
of
speech
now
enhanced
by
life
in
camp
as
well
as
court
just
brought
up
one
family
and
starting
out
to
get
another
you
surely
are
the
original
of
the
old
woman
who
lived
in
a
shoe
what
a
reactionary
you
are
reactionary
yes
gertrude
i
smiled
in
reply
i
suspect
i
some
things
i
hate
poverty
i
hate
to
think
of
city
or
country
slums
of
oppression
of
disorder
and
lawless
rich
or
unheeded
poor
possibly
from
among
those
i
rear
some
one
will
arise
to
fathom
and
solve
these
things
i
am
sure
greater
wisdom
is
slowly
filtering
into
our
lives
in
many
respects
i
am
as
you
charge
reactionary
i
still
have
a
feeling
that
every
human
being
must
be
a
center
of
creative
that
he
who
rears
children
is
multiplying
creators
in
the
the
resplendent
future
gertrude
laughed
a
shade
bitterly
i
thought
and
waved
her
hand
in
a
gesture
of
despair
at
my
ancient
stupidity
perhaps
i
should
not
have
prattled
in
this
strain
to
particularly
since
her
recent
husband
minot
blackden
has
followed
the
desire
of
his
eyes
elsewhere
in
absence
is
now
happily
divorced
and
married
to
some
one
who
shares
his
apartment
and
is
himself
shamelessly
begetting
offspring
no
gertrude
aside
there
is
no
contour
to
my
story
dibdin
indeed
still
appears
and
disappears
ever
the
flying
dutchman
as
of
old
he
is
at
home
now
and
often
sits
and
smokes
in
my
study
and
i
whisper
it
a
shade
more
prosily
than
of
old
the
only
devil
in
the
world
he
puffed
out
last
night
in
his
gruff
manner
as
though
pronouncing
doom
the
only
devil
is
the
darkness
of
chaos
children
are
the
gage
the
human
race
wisely
abetted
by
nature
is
throwing
down
to
this
devil
and
supposing
the
children
you
rear
should
turn
out
to
be
i
mildly
put
in
as
an
obliging
straw
man
what
does
that
matter
he
growled
most
people
are
nobodies
the
nobodies
of
the
world
that
bring
about
its
catastrophic
changes
mark
antony
cunningly
put
a

in

rare
i
grant
you
but
the

citizen
and

citizen
who
pulled
down
republican

about
the

of

as
well
as

the

we
need
all
what
kids
are
for
perhaps
i
should
own
at
this
point
that
in
my
secret
heart
i
agree
with
dibdin
just
as
in
reality
i
am
certain
that
life
has
a
contour
and
rhythm
of
its
own
the
world
may
appear
harsh
may
be
truly
for
justice
culture
beauty
but
whatever
its
shortcomings
the
business
of
the
human
race
in
it
seems
to
me
clear
to
extend
and
carry
on
the
race
of
measure
of
all
create
a
better
life
on
earth
all
the
world
is
a
man
living
in
a
shoe
but
somehow
very
slowly
it
is
acquiring
knowledge
learning
what
to
do
we
may
indeed
be
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
and
our
life
rounded
with
a
sleep
is
in
truth
pitifully
little
but
that
little
seems
mysteriously
tremendously
important
and
by
that
token
it
appears
to
me
that
there
is
no
such
creature
as
a
living
pessimist
the
only
certain
sign
of
genuine
conviction
on
the
part
of
a
pessimist
is
his
suicide
to
go
on
living
is
to
hope
for
better
to
hope
for
them
is
to
bring
them
about
that
is
how
life
appears
to
me
but
are
the
views
of
a
shrewd
bookseller
who
plays
golf
of
saturdays
of
any
account
but
enough
of
my
prating
alicia
will
doubtless
have
her
way
she
is
now
engaged
in
the
august
rites
of
the
younger
bath
i
expect
to
be
summoned
to
the
ceremony
at
any
time
to
such
small
dimensions
has
my
family
dwindled
that
all
attention
is
inevitably
centered
on
the
baby
laura
is
thousands
of
miles
away
in
california
with
the
young
surgeon
she
met
and
married
in
france
and
jimmie

years
of

island
randolph
junior
reigns
supreme
well
i
am
long
live
the
king
but
they
are
all
as
near
and
dear
to
me
as
ever
for
as
old
burton
his
anatomy
hath
it
no
cord
nor
cable
can
so
forcibly
draw
or
hold
so
fast
as
love
can
do
with
a
twined
thread
i
see
life
stretching
and
dynamic
before
me
glittering
with
possibility
as
the
atmosphere
sometimes
glitters
in
the
sunlight
with
flittering
dancing
revolving
eyes
made
like
mine
though
late
in
starting
i
must
plunge
into
the
life
of
responsibility
helping
how
slightly
soever
to
join
the
long
generations
of
the
past
in
preparing
the
dazzling
future
the
name
of
the
new
time
spirit
is
responsibility
at
this
point
alicia
appeared
to
summon
me
to
the
rites
of
the
bath
and
hung
for
a
moment
reading
over
my
shoulder
i
insist
upon
adding
two
words
to
that
she
announced
and
they
shall
be
the
last
it
is
your
privilege
beloved
i
agreed
and
eagerly
made
way
for
her
then
alicia
wrote
and
love
the
end
