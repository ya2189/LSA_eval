the
it
all
nonsense
said
jack
barnes
of
course
people
have
died
in
the
house
people
die
in
every
house
as
for
the
noises
wind
in
the
chimney
and
rats
in
the
wainscot
are
very
convincing
to
a
nervous
man
give
me
another
cup
of
tea
meagle
lester
and
white
are
first
said
meagle
who
was
presiding
at
the
of
the
three
feathers
inn
you
had
two
lester
and
white
finished
their
cups
with
irritating
slowness
pausing
between
sips
to
sniff
the
aroma
and
to
discover
the
sex
and
dates
of
arrival
of
the
strangers
which
floated
in
some
numbers
in
the
beverage
meagle
served
them
to
the
brim
and
then
turning
to
the
grimly
expectant
barnes
blandly
requested
him
to
ring
for
hot
water
we
try
and
keep
your
nerves
in
their
present
healthy
condition
he
remarked
for
my
part
i
have
a
sort
of
belief
in
the
all
sensible
people
have
said
lester
an
aunt
of
mine
saw
a
ghost
once
white
nodded
i
had
an
uncle
that
saw
one
he
said
it
always
is
somebody
else
that
sees
them
said
barnes
well
there
is
a
house
said
meagle
a
large
house
at
an
absurdly
low
rent
and
nobody
will
take
it
it
has
taken
toll
of
at
least
one
life
of
every
family
that
has
lived
there
however
short
the
time
and
since
it
has
stood
empty
caretaker
after
has
died
there
the
last
caretaker
died
fifteen
years
ago
exactly
said
barnes
long
enough
ago
for
legends
to
accumulate
i
bet
you
a
sovereign
you
wo
spend
the
night
there
alone
for
all
your
talk
said
white
suddenly
and
i
said
lester
no
said
barnes
slowly
i
do
believe
in
ghosts
nor
in
any
supernatural
things
whatever
all
the
same
i
admit
that
i
should
not
care
to
pass
a
night
there
alone
but
why
not
inquired
white
wind
in
the
chimney
said
meagle
with
a
grin
rats
in
the
wainscot
chimed
in
lester
as
you
like
said
barnes
coloring
suppose
we
all
go
said
meagle
start
after
supper
and
get
there
about
eleven
we
have
been
walking
for
ten
days
now
without
an
adventure
except
barnes
discovery
that
ditchwater
smells
longest
it
will
be
a
novelty
at
any
rate
and
if
we
break
the
spell
by
all
surviving
the
grateful
owner
ought
to
come
down
handsome
let
see
what
the
landlord
has
to
say
about
it
first
said
lester
there
is
no
fun
in
passing
a
night
in
an
ordinary
empty
house
let
us
make
sure
that
it
is
haunted
he
rang
the
bell
and
sending
for
the
landlord
appealed
to
him
in
the
name
of
our
common
humanity
not
to
let
them
waste
a
night
watching
in
a
house
in
which
spectres
and
hobgoblins
had
no
part
the
reply
was
more
than
reassuring
and
the
landlord
after
describing
with
considerable
art
the
exact
appearance
of
a
head
which
had
been
seen
hanging
out
of
a
window
in
the
moonlight
wound
up
with
a
polite
but
urgent
request
that
they
would
settle
his
bill
before
they
went
it
all
very
well
for
you
young
gentlemen
to
have
your
fun
he
said
indulgently
but
supposing
as
how
you
are
all
found
dead
in
the
morning
what
about
me
it
ai
called
the
for
nothing
you
know
who
died
there
last
inquired
barnes
with
an
air
of
polite
derision
a
tramp
was
the
reply
he
went
there
for
the
sake
of
half
a
crown
and
they
found
him
next
morning
hanging
from
the
balusters
dead
suicide
said
barnes
unsound
mind
the
landlord
nodded
that
what
the
jury
brought
it
in
he
said
slowly
but
his
mind
was
sound
enough
when
he
went
in
there
i
known
him
off
and
on
for
years
i
a
poor
man
but
i
would
spend
the
night
in
that
house
for
a
hundred
pounds
illustration
i
a
poor
man
but
i
would
spend
the
night
in
that
house
for
a
hundred
pounds
he
repeated
this
remark
as
they
started
on
their
expedition
a
few
hours
later
they
left
as
the
inn
was
closing
for
the
night
bolts
shot
noisily
behind
them
and
as
the
regular
customers
trudged
slowly
homewards
they
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
in
the
direction
of
the
house
most
of
the
cottages
were
already
in
darkness
and
lights
in
others
went
out
as
they
passed
it
seems
rather
hard
that
we
have
got
to
lose
a
night
rest
in
order
to
convince
barnes
of
the
existence
of
ghosts
said
white
it
in
a
good
cause
said
meagle
a
most
worthy
object
and
something
seems
to
tell
me
that
we
shall
succeed
you
did
forget
the
candles
lester
i
have
brought
two
was
the
reply
all
the
old
man
could
spare
there
was
but
little
moon
and
the
night
was
cloudy
the
road
between
high
hedges
was
dark
and
in
one
place
where
it
ran
through
a
wood
so
black
that
they
twice
stumbled
in
the
uneven
ground
at
the
side
of
it
fancy
leaving
our
comfortable
beds
for
this
said
white
again
let
me
see
this
desirable
residential
sepulchre
lies
to
the
right
it
farther
on
said
meagle
they
walked
on
for
some
time
in
silence
broken
only
by
white
tribute
to
the
softness
the
cleanliness
and
the
comfort
of
the
bed
which
was
receding
farther
and
farther
into
the
distance
under
meagle
guidance
they
turned
oft
at
last
to
the
right
and
after
a
walk
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
saw
the
gates
of
the
house
before
them
illustration
they
saw
the
gates
of
the
house
before
them
the
lodge
was
almost
hidden
by
overgrown
shrubs
and
the
drive
was
choked
with
rank
growths
meagle
leading
they
pushed
through
it
until
the
dark
pile
of
the
house
loomed
above
them
there
is
a
window
at
the
back
where
we
can
get
in
so
the
landlord
says
said
lester
as
they
stood
before
the
hall
door
window
said
meagle
nonsense
let
do
the
thing
properly
the
knocker
he
felt
for
it
in
the
darkness
and
gave
a
thundering
at
the
door
do
play
the
fool
said
barnes
crossly
ghostly
servants
are
all
asleep
said
meagle
gravely
but
i
wake
them
up
before
i
done
with
them
it
scandalous
keeping
us
out
here
in
the
dark
he
plied
the
knocker
again
and
the
noise
volleyed
in
the
emptiness
beyond
then
with
a
sudden
exclamation
he
put
out
his
hands
and
stumbled
forward
why
it
was
open
all
the
time
he
said
with
an
odd
catch
in
his
voice
come
on
i
do
believe
it
was
open
said
lester
hanging
back
somebody
is
playing
us
a
trick
nonsense
said
meagle
sharply
give
me
a
candle
thanks
who
got
a
match
barnes
produced
a
box
and
struck
one
and
meagle
shielding
the
candle
with
his
hand
led
the
way
forward
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
shut
the
door
somebody
he
said
there
too
much
draught
it
is
shut
said
white
glancing
behind
him
meagle
fingered
his
chin
who
shut
it
he
inquired
looking
from
one
to
the
other
who
came
in
last
i
did
said
lester
but
i
do
remember
shutting
it
perhaps
i
did
though
meagle
about
to
speak
thought
better
of
it
and
still
carefully
guarding
the
flame
began
to
explore
the
house
with
the
others
close
behind
shadows
danced
on
the
walls
and
lurked
in
the
corners
as
they
proceeded
at
the
end
of
the
passage
they
found
a
second
staircase
and
ascending
it
slowly
gained
the
first
floor
careful
said
meagle
as
they
gained
the
landing
he
held
the
candle
forward
and
showed
where
the
balusters
had
broken
away
then
he
peered
curiously
into
the
void
beneath
this
is
where
the
tramp
hanged
himself
i
suppose
he
said
thoughtfully
you
got
an
unwholesome
mind
said
white
as
they
walked
on
this
place
is
qutie
creepy
enough
without
your
remembering
that
now
find
a
comfortable
room
and
have
a
little
nip
of
whiskey
apiece
and
a
pipe
how
will
this
do
he
opened
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
revealed
a
small
square
room
meagle
led
the
way
with
the
candle
and
first
melting
a
drop
or
two
of
tallow
stuck
it
on
the
mantelpiece
the
others
seated
themselves
on
the
floor
and
watched
pleasantly
as
white
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
bottle
of
whiskey
and
a
tin
cup
h
i
forgotten
the
water
he
exclaimed
i
soon
get
some
said
meagle
he
tugged
violently
at
the
and
the
rusty
jangling
of
a
bell
sounded
from
a
distant
kitchen
he
rang
again
do
play
the
fool
said
barnes
roughly
meagle
laughed
i
only
wanted
to
convince
you
he
said
kindly
there
ought
to
be
at
any
rate
one
ghost
in
the
servants
hall
barnes
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
yes
said
meagle
with
a
grin
at
the
other
two
is
anybody
coming
suppose
we
drop
this
game
and
go
back
said
barnes
suddenly
i
believe
in
spirits
but
nerves
are
outside
anybody
command
you
may
laugh
as
you
like
but
it
really
seemed
to
me
that
i
heard
a
door
open
below
and
steps
on
the
stairs
his
voice
was
drowned
in
a
roar
of
laughter
he
is
coming
round
said
meagle
with
a
smirk
by
the
time
i
have
done
with
him
he
will
be
a
confirmed
believer
well
who
will
go
and
get
some
water
will
you
barnes
no
was
the
reply
if
there
is
any
it
might
not
be
safe
to
drink
after
all
these
years
said
lester
we
must
do
without
it
meagle
nodded
and
taking
a
seat
on
the
floor
held
out
his
hand
for
the
cup
pipes
were
lit
and
the
clean
wholesome
smell
of
tobacco
filled
the
room
white
produced
a
pack
of
cards
talk
and
laughter
rang
through
the
room
and
died
away
reluctantly
in
distant
corridors
empty
rooms
always
delude
me
into
the
belief
that
i
possess
a
deep
voice
said
meagle
he
started
up
with
a
smothered
exclamation
as
the
light
went
out
suddenly
and
something
struck
him
on
the
head
the
others
sprang
to
their
feet
then
meagle
laughed
it
the
candle
he
exclaimed
i
did
stick
it
enough
barnes
struck
a
match
and
relighting
the
candle
stuck
it
on
the
mantelpiece
and
sitting
down
took
up
his
cards
again
what
was
i
going
to
say
said
meagle
oh
i
know
i
listen
said
white
laying
his
hand
on
the
other
sleeve
upon
my
word
i
really
thought
i
heard
a
laugh
look
here
said
barnes
what
do
you
say
to
going
back
i
had
enough
of
this
i
keep
fancying
that
i
hear
things
too
sounds
of
something
moving
about
in
the
passage
outside
i
know
it
only
fancy
but
it
uncomfortable
you
go
if
you
want
to
said
meagle
and
we
will
play
dummy
or
you
might
ask
the
tramp
to
take
your
hand
for
you
as
you
go
downstairs
barnes
shivered
and
exclaimed
angrily
he
got
up
and
walking
to
the
door
listened
go
outside
said
meagle
winking
at
the
other
two
i
dare
you
to
go
down
to
the
hall
door
and
back
by
yourself
barnes
came
back
and
bending
forward
lit
his
pipe
at
the
candle
i
am
nervous
but
rational
he
said
blowing
out
a
thin
cloud
of
smoke
my
nerves
tell
me
that
there
is
something
prowling
up
and
down
the
long
passage
outside
my
reason
tells
me
that
it
is
all
nonsense
where
are
my
cards
he
sat
down
again
and
taking
up
his
hand
looked
through
it
carefully
and
led
your
play
white
he
said
after
a
pause
white
made
no
sign
why
he
is
asleep
said
meagle
wake
up
old
man
wake
up
and
play
lester
who
was
sitting
next
to
him
took
the
sleeping
man
by
the
arm
and
shook
him
gently
at
first
and
then
with
some
roughness
but
white
with
his
back
against
the
wall
and
his
head
bowed
made
no
sign
meagle
bawled
in
his
ear
and
then
turned
a
puzzled
face
to
the
others
he
sleeps
like
the
dead
he
said
grimacing
well
there
are
still
three
of
us
to
keep
each
other
company
yes
said
lester
nodding
unless
good
lord
suppose
he
broke
off
and
eyed
them
trembling
suppose
what
inquired
meagle
nothing
stammered
lester
let
wake
him
try
him
again
white
it
no
good
said
meagle
seriously
there
something
wrong
about
that
sleep
that
what
i
meant
said
lester
and
if
he
goes
to
sleep
like
that
why
should
meagle
sprang
to
his
feet
nonsense
he
said
roughly
he
tired
out
that
all
still
let
take
him
up
and
clear
out
you
take
his
legs
and
barnes
will
lead
the
way
with
the
candle
yes
who
that
he
looked
up
quickly
towards
the
door
thought
i
heard
somebody
tap
he
said
with
a
shamefaced
laugh
now
lester
up
with
him
one
two
lester
lester
he
sprang
forward
too
late
lester
with
his
face
buried
in
his
arms
had
rolled
over
on
the
floor
fast
asleep
and
his
utmost
efforts
failed
to
awaken
him
he
is
asleep
he
stammered
barnes
who
had
taken
the
candle
from
the
stood
peering
at
the
sleepers
in
silence
and
dropping
tallow
over
the
floor
illustration
barnes
stood
peering
at
the
sleepers
in
silence
and
dropping
tallow
over
the
floor
we
must
get
out
of
this
said
meagle
quick
barnes
hesitated
we
ca
leave
them
here
he
began
we
must
said
meagle
in
strident
tones
if
you
go
to
sleep
i
shall
go
quick
come
he
seized
the
other
by
the
arm
and
strove
to
drag
him
to
the
door
barnes
shook
him
off
and
putting
the
candle
back
on
the
mantelpiece
tried
again
to
arouse
the
sleepers
it
no
good
he
said
at
last
and
turning
from
them
watched
meagle
do
you
go
to
sleep
he
said
anxiously
meagle
shook
his
head
and
they
stood
for
some
time
in
uneasy
silence
may
as
well
shut
the
door
said
barnes
at
last
he
crossed
over
and
closed
it
gently
then
at
a
scuffling
noise
behind
him
he
turned
and
saw
meagle
in
a
heap
on
the
hearthstone
with
a
sharp
catch
in
his
breath
he
stood
motionless
inside
the
room
the
candle
fluttering
in
the
draught
showed
dimly
the
grotesque
attitudes
of
the
sleepers
beyond
the
door
there
seemed
to
his
wrought
imagination
a
strange
and
stealthy
unrest
he
tried
to
whistle
but
his
lips
were
parched
and
in
a
mechanical
fashion
he
stooped
and
began
to
pick
up
the
cards
which
littered
the
floor
he
stopped
once
or
twice
and
stood
with
bent
head
listening
the
unrest
outside
seemed
to
increase
a
loud
creaking
sounded
from
the
stairs
who
is
there
he
cried
loudly
the
creaking
ceased
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
flinging
it
open
strode
out
into
the
corridor
as
he
walked
his
fears
left
him
suddenly
come
on
he
cried
with
a
low
laugh
all
of
you
all
of
you
show
your
faces
your
infernal
ugly
faces
do
skulk
he
laughed
again
and
walked
on
and
the
heap
in
the
fireplace
put
out
his
head
tortoise
fashion
and
listened
in
horror
to
the
retreating
footsteps
not
until
they
had
become
inaudible
in
the
distance
did
the
features
relax
good
lord
lester
we
driven
him
mad
he
said
in
a
frightened
whisper
we
must
go
after
him
there
was
no
reply
meagle
sprung
to
his
feet
do
you
hear
he
cried
stop
your
fooling
now
this
is
serious
white
lester
do
you
hear
he
bent
and
surveyed
them
in
angry
bewilderment
all
right
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
you
wo
frighten
me
you
know
he
turned
away
and
walked
with
exaggerated
carelessness
in
the
direction
of
the
door
he
even
went
outside
and
peeped
through
the
crack
but
the
sleepers
did
not
stir
he
glanced
into
the
blackness
behind
and
then
came
hastily
into
the
room
again
he
stood
for
a
few
seconds
regarding
them
the
stillness
in
the
house
was
horrible
he
could
not
even
hear
them
breathe
with
a
sudden
resolution
he
snatched
the
candle
from
the
mantelpiece
and
held
the
flame
to
white
finger
then
as
he
reeled
back
stupefied
the
footsteps
again
became
audible
he
stood
with
the
candle
in
his
shaking
hand
listening
he
heard
them
ascending
the
farther
staircase
but
they
stopped
suddenly
as
he
went
to
the
door
he
walked
a
little
way
along
the
passage
and
they
went
scurrying
down
the
stairs
and
then
at
a
along
the
corridor
below
he
went
back
to
the
main
staircase
and
they
ceased
again
for
a
time
he
hung
over
the
balusters
listening
and
trying
to
pierce
the
blackness
below
then
slowly
step
by
step
he
made
his
way
downstairs
and
holding
the
candle
above
his
head
peered
about
him
barnes
he
called
where
are
you
shaking
with
fright
he
made
his
way
along
the
passage
and
summoning
up
all
his
courage
pushed
open
doors
and
gazed
fearfully
into
empty
rooms
then
quite
suddenly
he
heard
the
footsteps
in
front
of
him
he
followed
slowly
for
fear
of
extinguishing
the
candle
until
they
led
him
at
last
into
a
vast
bare
kitchen
with
damp
walls
and
a
broken
floor
in
front
of
him
a
door
leading
into
an
inside
room
had
just
closed
he
ran
towards
it
and
flung
it
open
and
a
cold
air
blew
out
the
candle
he
stood
aghast
illustration
into
a
vast
bare
kitchen
with
damp
walls
and
a
broken
floor
barnes
he
cried
again
do
be
afraid
it
is
i
meagle
there
was
no
answer
he
stood
gazing
into
the
darkness
and
all
the
time
the
idea
of
something
close
at
hand
watching
was
upon
him
then
suddenly
the
steps
broke
out
overhead
again
he
drew
back
hastily
and
passing
through
the
kitchen
groped
his
way
along
the
narrow
passages
he
could
now
see
better
in
the
darkness
and
finding
himself
at
last
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
began
to
ascend
it
noiselessly
he
reached
the
landing
just
in
time
to
see
a
figure
disappear
round
the
angle
of
a
wall
still
careful
to
make
no
noise
he
followed
the
sound
of
the
steps
until
they
led
him
to
the
top
floor
and
he
cornered
the
chase
at
the
end
of
a
short
passage
barnes
he
whispered
barnes
something
stirred
in
the
darkness
a
small
circular
window
at
the
end
of
the
passage
just
softened
the
blackness
and
revealed
the
dim
outlines
of
a
motionless
figure
meagle
in
place
of
advancing
stood
almost
as
still
as
a
sudden
horrible
doubt
took
possession
of
him
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
shape
in
front
he
fell
back
slowly
and
as
it
advanced
upon
him
burst
into
a
terrible
cry
barnes
for
god
sake
is
it
you
the
echoes
of
his
voice
left
the
air
quivering
but
the
figure
before
him
paid
no
heed
for
a
moment
he
tried
to
brace
his
courage
up
to
endure
its
approach
then
with
a
smothered
cry
he
turned
and
fled
the
passages
wound
like
a
maze
and
he
threaded
them
blindly
in
a
vain
search
for
the
stairs
if
he
could
get
down
and
open
the
hall
door
he
caught
his
breath
in
a
sob
the
steps
had
begun
again
at
a
lumbering
trot
they
clattered
up
and
down
the
bare
passages
in
and
out
up
and
down
as
though
in
search
of
him
he
stood
appalled
and
then
as
they
drew
near
entered
a
small
room
and
stood
behind
the
door
as
they
rushed
by
he
came
out
and
ran
swiftly
and
noiselessly
in
the
other
direction
and
in
a
moment
the
steps
were
after
him
he
found
the
long
corridor
and
raced
along
it
at
top
speed
the
stairs
he
knew
were
at
the
end
and
with
the
steps
close
behind
he
descended
them
in
blind
haste
the
steps
gained
on
him
and
he
shrank
to
the
side
to
let
them
pass
still
continuing
his
headlong
flight
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
slip
off
the
earth
into
space
lester
awoke
in
the
morning
to
find
the
sunshine
streaming
into
the
room
and
white
sitting
up
and
regarding
with
some
perplexity
a
badly
blistered
finger
where
are
the
others
inquired
lester
gone
i
suppose
said
white
we
must
have
been
asleep
lester
arose
and
stretching
his
stiffened
limbs
dusted
his
clothes
with
his
hands
and
went
out
into
the
corridor
white
followed
at
the
noise
of
their
approach
a
figure
which
had
been
lying
asleep
at
the
other
end
sat
up
and
revealed
the
face
of
barnes
why
i
been
asleep
he
said
in
surprise
i
do
remember
coming
here
how
did
i
get
here
nice
place
to
come
for
a
nap
said
lester
severely
as
he
pointed
to
the
gap
in
the
balusters
look
there
another
yard
and
where
would
you
have
been
he
walked
carelessly
to
the
edge
and
looked
over
in
response
to
his
startled
cry
the
others
drew
near
and
all
three
stood
gazing
at
the
dead
man
below

all
three
