an
account
of
certain
adventures
that
befell
henry
mostyn
under
captain
morgan
in
the
year
i
although
this
narration
has
more
particularly
to
do
with
the
taking
of
the
spanish
in
the
harbor
of
puerto
bello
and
of
the
rescue
therefrom
of
le
sieur
simon
his
wife
and
daughter
the
adventure
of
which
was
successfully
achieved
by
captain
morgan
the
famous
buccaneer
we
shall
nevertheless
premise
something
of
the
earlier
history
of
master
harry
mostyn
whom
you
may
if
you
please
consider
as
the
hero
of
the
several
circumstances
recounted
in
these
pages
in
the
year
our
hero
father
embarked
from
portsmouth
in
england
for
the
barbadoes
where
he
owned
a
considerable
sugar
plantation
thither
to
those
parts
of
america
he
transported
with
himself
his
whole
family
of
whom
our
master
harry
was
the
fifth
of
eight
children
a
great
lusty
fellow
as
little
fitted
for
the
church
for
which
he
was
designed
as
could
be
at
the
time
of
this
story
though
not
above
sixteen
years
old
master
harry
mostyn
was
as
big
and
as
many
a
man
of
twenty
and
of
such
a
reckless
and
spirit
that
no
adventure
was
too
dangerous
or
too
mischievous
for
him
to
embark
upon
at
this
time
there
was
a
deal
of
talk
in
those
parts
of
the
americas
concerning
captain
morgan
and
the
prodigious
successes
he
was
having
pirating
against
the
spaniards
this
man
had
once
been
an
indentured
servant
with
rolls
a
sugar
factor
at
the
barbadoes
having
served
out
his
time
and
being
of
lawless
disposition
possessing
also
a
prodigious
appetite
for
adventure
he
joined
with
others
of
his
kidney
and
purchasing
a
caraval
of
three
guns
embarked
fairly
upon
that
career
of
piracy
the
most
successful
that
ever
was
heard
of
in
the
world
master
harry
had
known
this
man
very
well
while
he
was
still
with
rolls
serving
as
a
clerk
at
that
gentleman
sugar
wharf
a
tall
strapping
fellow
with
red
cheeks
and
thick
red
lips
and
rolling
blue
eyes
and
hair
as
red
as
any
chestnut
many
knew
him
for
a
bold
man
but
no
one
at
that
time
suspected
that
he
had
it
in
him
to
become
so
famous
and
renowned
as
he
afterwards
grew
to
be
the
fame
of
his
exploits
had
been
the
talk
of
those
parts
for
above
a
twelvemonth
when
in
the
latter
part
of
the
year
captain
morgan
having
made
a
very
successful
expedition
against
the
spaniards
into
the
gulf
of
campeachy
where
he
took
several
important
purchases
from
the
plate
fleet
came
to
the
barbadoes
there
to
fit
out
another
such
venture
and
to
enlist
recruits
he
and
certain
other
adventurers
had
purchased
a
vessel
of
some
five
hundred
tons
which
they
proposed
to
convert
into
a
pirate
by
cutting
for
cannon
and
running
three
or
four
carronades
across
her
the
name
of
this
ship
be
it
mentioned
was
the
as
a
name
as
could
be
for
such
a
craft
which
instead
of
being
designed
for
the
healing
of
wounds
was
intended
to
inflict
such
devastation
as
those
wicked
men
proposed
here
was
a
piece
of
mischief
exactly
fitted
to
our
hero
tastes
wherefore
having
made
up
a
bundle
of
clothes
and
with
not
above
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
he
made
an
excursion
into
the
town
to
seek
for
captain
morgan
there
he
found
the
great
pirate
established
at
an
ordinary
with
a
little
court
of
ragamuffins
and
swashbucklers
gathered
about
him
all
talking
very
loud
and
drinking
healths
in
raw
rum
as
though
it
were
sugared
water
and
what
a
fine
figure
our
buccaneer
had
grown
to
be
sure
how
different
from
the
poor
humble
clerk
upon
the
sugarwharf
what
a
deal
of
gold
braid
what
a
fine
spanish
sword
what
a
gay
velvet
sling
hung
with
three
pistols
if
master
mind
had
not
been
made
up
before
to
be
sure
such
a
spectacle
of
glory
would
have
determined
it
this
figure
of
war
our
hero
asked
to
step
aside
with
him
and
when
they
had
come
into
a
corner
proposed
to
the
other
what
he
intended
and
that
he
had
a
mind
to
enlist
as
a
gentleman
adventurer
upon
this
expedition
upon
this
our
rogue
of
a
buccaneer
captain
burst
out
and
fetching
master
harry
a
great
thump
upon
the
back
swore
roundly
that
he
would
make
a
man
of
him
and
that
it
was
a
pity
to
make
a
parson
out
of
so
good
a
piece
of
stuff
illustration
this
figure
of
war
our
hero
asked
to
step
aside
with
him
nor
was
captain
morgan
less
good
than
his
word
for
when
the
set
sail
with
a
favoring
wind
for
the
island
of
jamaica
master
harry
found
himself
established
as
one
of
the
adventurers
aboard
ii
could
you
but
have
seen
the
town
of
port
royal
as
it
appeared
in
the
year
you
would
have
beheld
a
sight
very
well
worth
while
looking
upon
there
were
no
fine
houses
at
that
time
and
no
great
built
of
brick
such
as
you
may
find
nowadays
but
a
crowd
of
board
and
wattled
huts
huddled
along
the
streets
and
all
so
gay
with
flags
and
bits
of
color
that
vanity
fair
itself
could
not
have
been
gayer
to
this
place
came
all
the
pirates
and
buccaneers
that
infested
those
parts
and
men
shouted
and
swore
and
gambled
and
poured
out
money
like
water
and
then
maybe
wound
up
their
merrymaking
by
dying
of
fever
for
the
sky
in
these
torrid
latitudes
is
all
full
of
clouds
overhead
and
as
hot
as
any
blanket
and
when
the
sun
shone
forth
it
streamed
down
upon
the
smoking
sands
so
that
the
houses
were
ovens
and
the
streets
were
furnaces
so
it
was
little
wonder
that
men
died
like
rats
in
a
hole
but
little
they
appeared
to
care
for
that
so
that
everywhere
you
might
behold
a
multitude
of
painted
women
and
jews
and
merchants
and
pirates
gaudy
with
red
scarfs
and
gold
braid
and
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
of
foolish
finery
all
fighting
and
gambling
and
bartering
for
that
treasure
of
the
spaniard
here
arriving
captain
morgan
found
a
hearty
welcome
and
a
message
from
the
governor
awaiting
him
the
message
bidding
him
attend
his
excellency
upon
the
earliest
occasion
that
offered
whereupon
taking
our
hero
of
whom
he
had
grown
prodigiously
fond
along
with
him
our
pirate
went
without
any
loss
of
time
to
visit
sir
thomas
modiford
who
was
then
the
royal
governor
of
all
this
devil
brew
of
wickedness
they
found
his
excellency
seated
in
a
great
under
the
shadow
of
a
slatted
veranda
the
floor
whereof
was
paved
with
brick
he
was
clad
for
the
sake
of
coolness
only
in
his
shirt
breeches
and
stockings
and
he
wore
slippers
on
his
feet
he
was
smoking
a
great
cigarro
of
tobacco
and
a
goblet
of
and
water
and
rum
stood
at
his
elbow
on
a
table
here
out
of
the
glare
of
the
heat
it
was
all
very
cool
and
pleasant
with
a
blowing
violently
in
through
the
slats
setting
them
now
and
then
and
stirring
sir
thomas
long
hair
which
he
had
pushed
back
for
the
sake
of
coolness
the
purport
of
this
interview
i
may
tell
you
concerned
the
rescue
of
one
le
sieur
simon
who
together
with
his
wife
and
daughter
was
held
captive
by
the
spaniards
this
gentleman
adventurer
le
sieur
simon
had
a
few
years
before
been
set
up
by
the
buccaneers
as
governor
of
the
island
of
santa
catherina
this
place
though
well
fortified
by
the
spaniards
the
buccaneers
had
seized
upon
establishing
themselves
thereon
and
so
infesting
the
commerce
of
those
seas
that
no
spanish
fleet
was
safe
from
them
at
last
the
spaniards
no
longer
able
to
endure
these
assaults
against
their
commerce
sent
a
great
force
against
the
freebooters
to
drive
them
out
of
their
island
stronghold
this
they
did
retaking
santa
catherina
together
with
its
governor
his
wife
and
daughter
as
well
as
the
whole
garrison
of
buccaneers
this
garrison
were
sent
by
their
conquerors
some
to
the
galleys
some
to
the
mines
some
to
no
man
knows
where
the
governor
himself
le
sieur
simon
was
to
be
sent
to
spain
there
to
stand
his
trial
for
piracy
the
news
of
all
this
i
may
tell
you
had
only
just
been
received
in
jamaica
having
been
brought
thither
by
a
spanish
captain
one
don
roderiguez
sylvia
who
was
besides
the
bearer
of
despatches
to
the
spanish
authorities
relating
the
whole
affair
such
in
fine
was
the
purport
of
this
interview
and
as
our
hero
and
his
captain
walked
back
together
from
the
governor
house
to
the
ordinary
where
they
had
taken
up
their
inn
the
buccaneer
assured
his
companion
that
he
purposed
to
obtain
those
despatches
from
the
spanish
captain
that
very
afternoon
even
if
he
had
to
use
force
to
seize
them
all
this
you
are
to
understand
was
undertaken
only
because
of
the
friendship
that
the
governor
and
captain
morgan
entertained
for
le
sieur
simon
and
indeed
it
was
wonderful
how
honest
and
how
faithful
were
these
wicked
men
in
their
dealings
with
one
another
for
you
must
know
that
governor
modiford
and
le
sieur
simon
and
the
buccaneers
were
all
of
one
kidney
all
taking
a
share
in
the
piracies
of
those
times
and
all
holding
by
one
another
as
though
they
were
the
honestest
men
in
the
world
hence
it
was
they
were
all
so
determined
to
rescue
le
sieur
simon
from
the
spaniards
iii
having
reached
his
ordinary
after
his
interview
with
the
governor
captain
morgan
found
there
a
number
of
his
companions
such
as
usually
gathered
at
that
place
to
be
in
attendance
upon
him
some
those
belonging
to
the
others
those
who
hoped
to
obtain
benefits
from
him
others
those
ragamuffins
who
gathered
around
him
because
he
was
famous
and
because
it
pleased
them
to
be
of
his
court
and
to
be
called
his
followers
for
nearly
always
your
successful
pirate
had
such
a
little
court
surrounding
him
finding
a
dozen
or
more
of
these
rascals
gathered
there
captain
morgan
informed
them
of
his
present
purpose
that
he
was
going
to
find
the
spanish
captain
to
demand
his
papers
of
him
and
calling
upon
them
to
accompany
him
with
this
following
at
his
heels
our
buccaneer
started
off
down
the
street
his
lieutenant
a
cornishman
named
bartholomew
davis
upon
one
hand
and
our
hero
upon
the
other
so
they
paraded
the
streets
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
before
they
found
the
spanish
captain
for
whether
he
had
got
wind
that
captain
morgan
was
searching
for
him
or
whether
finding
himself
in
a
place
so
full
of
his
enemies
he
had
buried
himself
in
some
place
of
hiding
it
is
certain
that
the
buccaneers
had
traversed
pretty
nearly
the
whole
town
before
they
discovered
that
he
was
lying
at
a
certain
auberge
kept
by
a
portuguese
jew
thither
they
went
and
thither
captain
morgan
entered
with
the
utmost
coolness
and
composure
of
demeanor
his
followers
crowding
noisily
in
at
his
heels
the
space
within
was
very
dark
being
lighted
only
by
the
doorway
and
by
two
large
slatted
windows
or
openings
in
the
front
in
this
dark
hot
place
not
at
the
best
were
gathered
twelve
or
fifteen
men
sitting
at
tables
and
drinking
together
waited
upon
by
the
jew
and
his
wife
our
hero
had
no
trouble
in
discovering
which
of
this
lot
of
men
was
captain
sylvia
for
not
only
did
captain
morgan
direct
his
glance
full
of
war
upon
him
but
the
spaniard
was
clad
with
more
particularity
and
with
more
show
of
finery
than
any
of
the
others
who
were
there
him
captain
morgan
approached
and
demanded
his
papers
whereunto
the
other
replied
with
such
a
jabber
of
spanish
and
english
that
no
man
could
have
understood
what
he
said
to
this
captain
morgan
in
turn
replied
that
he
must
have
those
papers
no
matter
what
it
might
cost
him
to
obtain
them
and
thereupon
drew
a
pistol
from
his
sling
and
presented
it
at
the
other
head
at
this
threatening
action
the
innkeeper
wife
fell
and
the
jew
as
in
a
frenzy
besought
them
not
to
tear
the
house
down
about
his
ears
our
hero
could
hardly
tell
what
followed
only
that
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
prodigious
uproar
of
combat
knives
flashed
everywhere
and
then
a
pistol
was
fired
so
close
to
his
head
that
he
stood
like
one
stunned
hearing
some
one
crying
out
in
a
loud
voice
but
not
knowing
whether
it
was
a
friend
or
a
foe
who
had
been
shot
then
another
so
deafened
what
was
left
of
master
harry
hearing
that
his
ears
rang
for
above
an
hour
afterwards
by
this
time
the
whole
place
was
full
of
gunpowder
smoke
and
there
was
the
sound
of
blows
and
oaths
and
outcrying
and
the
clashing
of
knives
as
master
harry
who
had
no
great
stomach
for
such
a
combat
and
no
very
particular
interest
in
the
quarrel
was
making
for
the
door
a
little
portuguese
as
withered
and
as
nimble
as
an
ape
came
ducking
under
the
table
and
plunged
at
his
stomach
with
a
great
long
knife
which
had
it
effected
its
object
would
surely
have
ended
his
adventures
then
and
there
finding
himself
in
such
danger
master
harry
snatched
up
a
heavy
chair
and
flinging
it
at
his
enemy
who
was
preparing
for
another
attack
he
fairly
ran
for
it
out
of
the
door
expecting
every
instant
to
feel
the
thrust
of
the
blade
betwixt
his
ribs
a
considerable
crowd
had
gathered
outside
and
others
hearing
the
uproar
were
coming
running
to
join
them
with
these
our
hero
stood
trembling
like
a
leaf
and
with
cold
chills
running
up
and
down
his
back
like
water
at
the
narrow
escape
from
the
danger
that
had
threatened
him
nor
shall
you
think
him
a
coward
for
you
must
remember
he
was
hardly
sixteen
years
old
at
the
time
and
that
this
was
the
first
affair
of
the
sort
he
had
encountered
afterwards
as
you
shall
learn
he
showed
that
he
could
exhibit
courage
enough
at
a
pinch
while
he
stood
there
endeavoring
to
recover
his
composure
the
while
the
tumult
continued
within
suddenly
two
men
came
running
almost
together
out
of
the
door
a
crowd
of
the
combatants
at
their
heels
the
first
of
these
men
was
captain
sylvia
the
other
who
was
pursuing
him
was
captain
morgan
as
the
crowd
about
the
door
parted
before
the
sudden
appearing
of
these
the
spanish
captain
perceiving
as
he
supposed
a
way
of
escape
opened
to
him
darted
across
the
street
with
incredible
swiftness
towards
an
alleyway
upon
the
other
side
upon
this
seeing
his
prey
like
to
get
away
from
him
captain
morgan
snatched
a
pistol
out
of
his
sling
and
resting
it
for
an
instant
across
his
arm
fired
at
the
flying
spaniard
and
that
with
so
true
an
aim
that
though
the
street
was
now
full
of
people
the
other
went
tumbling
over
and
over
all
of
a
heap
in
the
kennel
where
he
lay
after
a
twitch
or
two
as
still
as
a
log
at
the
sound
of
the
shot
and
the
fall
of
the
man
the
crowd
scattered
upon
all
sides
yelling
and
screaming
and
the
street
being
thus
pretty
clear
captain
morgan
ran
across
the
way
to
where
his
victim
lay
his
smoking
pistol
still
in
his
hand
and
our
hero
following
close
at
his
heels
our
poor
harry
had
never
before
beheld
a
man
killed
thus
in
an
instant
who
a
moment
before
had
been
so
full
of
life
and
activity
for
when
captain
morgan
turned
the
body
over
upon
its
back
he
could
perceive
at
a
glance
little
as
he
knew
of
such
matters
that
the
man
was
stone
dead
and
indeed
it
was
a
dreadful
sight
for
him
who
was
hardly
more
than
a
child
he
stood
rooted
for
he
knew
not
how
long
staring
down
at
the
dead
face
with
twitching
fingers
and
shuddering
limbs
meantime
a
great
crowd
was
gathering
about
them
again
as
for
captain
morgan
he
went
about
his
work
with
the
utmost
coolness
and
deliberation
imaginable
unbuttoning
the
waistcoat
and
the
shirt
of
the
man
he
had
murdered
with
fingers
that
neither
twitched
nor
shook
there
were
a
gold
cross
and
a
bunch
of
silver
medals
hung
by
a
about
the
neck
of
the
dead
man
this
captain
morgan
broke
away
with
a
snap
reaching
the
jingling
baubles
to
harry
who
took
them
in
his
nerveless
hand
and
fingers
that
he
could
hardly
close
upon
what
they
held
the
papers
captain
morgan
found
in
a
wallet
in
an
inner
of
the
spaniard
waistcoat
these
he
examined
one
by
one
and
finding
them
to
his
satisfaction
tied
them
up
again
and
slipped
the
wallet
and
its
contents
into
his
own
pocket
then
for
the
first
time
he
appeared
to
observe
master
harry
who
indeed
must
have
been
standing
the
perfect
picture
of
horror
and
dismay
whereupon
bursting
out
and
slipping
the
pistol
he
had
used
back
into
its
sling
again
he
fetched
poor
harry
a
great
slap
upon
the
back
bidding
him
be
a
man
for
that
he
would
see
many
such
sights
as
this
but
indeed
it
was
no
laughing
matter
for
poor
master
harry
for
it
was
many
a
day
before
his
imagination
could
rid
itself
of
the
image
of
the
dead
spaniard
face
and
as
he
walked
away
down
the
street
with
his
companions
leaving
the
crowd
behind
them
and
the
dead
body
where
it
lay
for
its
friends
to
look
after
his
ears
humming
and
ringing
from
the
deafening
noise
of
the
fired
in
the
close
room
and
the
sweat
trickling
down
his
face
in
drops
he
knew
not
whether
all
that
had
passed
had
been
real
or
whether
it
was
a
dream
from
which
he
might
presently
awaken
iv
the
papers
captain
morgan
had
thus
seized
upon
as
the
fruit
of
the
murder
he
had
committed
must
have
been
as
perfectly
satisfactory
to
him
as
could
be
for
having
paid
a
second
visit
that
evening
to
governor
modiford
the
pirate
lifted
anchor
the
next
morning
and
made
sail
towards
the
gulf
of
darien
there
after
cruising
about
in
those
waters
for
about
a
fortnight
without
falling
in
with
a
vessel
of
any
sort
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
overhauled
a
caravel
bound
from
puerto
bello
to
cartagena
which
vessel
they
took
and
finding
her
loaded
with
nothing
better
than
raw
hides
scuttled
and
sunk
her
being
then
about
twenty
leagues
from
the
main
of
cartagena
from
the
captain
of
this
vessel
they
learned
that
the
plate
fleet
was
then
lying
in
the
harbor
of
puerto
bello
not
yet
having
set
sail
thence
but
waiting
for
the
change
of
the
winds
before
embarking
for
spain
besides
this
which
was
a
good
deal
more
to
their
purpose
the
spaniards
told
the
pirates
that
the
sieur
simon
his
wife
and
daughter
were
confined
aboard
the
of
that
fleet
and
that
the
name
of
the
was
the
maria
y
so
soon
as
captain
morgan
had
obtained
the
information
he
desired
he
directed
his
course
straight
for
the
bay
of
santo
blaso
where
he
might
lie
safely
within
the
cape
of
that
name
without
any
danger
of
discovery
that
part
of
the
being
entirely
uninhabited
and
yet
be
within
twenty
or
leagues
of
puerto
bello
having
come
safely
to
this
anchorage
he
at
once
declared
his
intentions
to
his
companions
which
were
as
follows
that
it
was
entirely
impossible
for
them
to
hope
to
sail
their
vessel
into
the
harbor
of
puerto
bello
and
to
attack
the
spanish
where
he
lay
in
the
midst
of
the
armed
flota
wherefore
if
anything
was
to
be
accomplished
it
must
be
undertaken
by
some
subtle
design
rather
than
by
boldness
having
so
prefaced
what
he
had
to
say
he
now
declared
that
it
was
his
purpose
to
take
one
of
the
boats
and
to
go
in
that
to
puerto
bello
trusting
for
some
opportunity
to
occur
to
aid
him
either
in
the
accomplishment
of
his
aims
or
in
the
gaining
of
some
further
information
having
thus
delivered
himself
he
invited
any
who
dared
to
do
so
to
volunteer
for
the
expedition
telling
them
plainly
that
he
would
constrain
no
man
to
go
against
his
will
for
that
at
best
it
was
a
desperate
enterprise
possessing
only
the
recommendation
that
in
its
achievement
the
few
who
undertook
it
would
gain
great
renown
and
perhaps
a
very
considerable
booty
and
such
was
the
incredible
influence
of
this
bold
man
over
his
companions
and
such
was
their
confidence
in
his
skill
and
cunning
that
not
above
a
dozen
of
all
those
aboard
hung
back
from
the
undertaking
but
nearly
every
man
desired
to
be
taken
of
these
volunteers
captain
morgan
chose
twenty
among
others
our
master
harry
and
having
arranged
with
his
lieutenant
that
if
nothing
was
heard
from
the
expedition
at
the
end
of
three
days
he
should
sail
for
jamaica
to
await
news
he
embarked
upon
that
enterprise
which
though
never
heretofore
published
was
perhaps
the
boldest
and
the
most
desperate
of
all
those
that
have
since
made
his
name
so
famous
for
what
could
be
a
more
unparalleled
undertaking
than
for
a
little
open
boat
containing
but
twenty
men
to
enter
the
harbor
of
the
third
strongest
fortress
of
the
spanish
mainland
with
the
intention
of
cutting
out
the
spanish
from
the
midst
of
a
whole
fleet
of
powerfully
armed
vessels
and
how
many
men
in
all
the
world
do
you
suppose
would
venture
such
a
thing
but
there
is
this
to
be
said
of
that
great
buccaneer
that
if
he
undertook
enterprises
so
desperate
as
this
he
yet
laid
his
plans
so
well
that
they
never
went
altogether
amiss
moreover
the
very
desperation
of
his
successes
was
of
such
a
nature
that
no
man
could
suspect
that
he
would
dare
to
undertake
such
things
and
accordingly
his
enemies
were
never
prepared
to
guard
against
his
attacks
aye
had
he
but
worn
the
king
colors
and
served
under
the
rules
of
honest
war
he
might
have
become
as
great
and
as
renowned
as
admiral
blake
himself
but
all
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
what
i
have
to
tell
you
now
is
that
captain
morgan
in
this
open
boat
with
his
twenty
mates
reached
the
cape
of
salmedina
towards
the
fall
of
day
arriving
within
view
of
the
harbor
they
discovered
the
plate
fleet
at
anchor
with
two
and
an
armed
galley
riding
as
a
guard
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
scarce
half
a
league
distant
from
the
other
ships
having
spied
the
fleet
in
this
posture
the
pirates
presently
pulled
down
their
sails
and
rowed
along
the
coast
feigning
to
be
a
spanish
vessel
from
nombre
de
dios
so
hugging
the
shore
they
came
boldly
within
the
harbor
upon
the
opposite
side
of
which
you
might
see
the
fortress
a
considerable
distance
away
being
now
come
so
near
to
the
consummation
of
their
adventure
captain
morgan
required
every
man
to
make
an
oath
to
stand
by
him
to
the
last
whereunto
our
hero
swore
as
heartily
as
any
man
aboard
although
his
heart
i
must
needs
confess
was
beating
at
a
great
rate
at
the
approach
of
what
was
to
happen
having
thus
received
the
oaths
of
all
his
followers
captain
morgan
commanded
the
surgeon
of
the
expedition
that
when
the
order
was
given
he
the
medico
was
to
bore
six
holes
in
the
boat
so
that
it
sinking
under
them
they
might
all
be
compelled
to
push
forward
with
no
chance
of
retreat
and
such
was
the
ascendency
of
this
man
over
his
followers
and
such
was
their
awe
of
him
that
not
one
of
them
uttered
even
so
much
as
a
murmur
though
what
he
had
commanded
the
surgeon
to
do
pledged
them
either
to
victory
or
to
death
with
no
chance
to
choose
between
nor
did
the
surgeon
question
the
orders
he
had
received
much
less
did
he
dream
of
disobeying
them
by
now
it
had
fallen
pretty
dusk
whereupon
spying
two
fishermen
in
a
canoe
at
a
little
distance
captain
morgan
demanded
of
them
in
spanish
which
vessel
of
those
at
anchor
in
the
harbor
was
the
for
that
he
had
despatches
for
the
captain
thereof
whereupon
the
fishermen
suspecting
nothing
pointed
to
them
a
galleon
of
great
size
riding
at
anchor
not
half
a
league
distant
towards
this
vessel
accordingly
the
pirates
directed
their
course
and
when
they
had
come
pretty
nigh
captain
morgan
called
upon
the
surgeon
that
now
it
was
time
for
him
to
perform
the
duty
that
had
been
laid
upon
him
whereupon
the
other
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
that
so
thoroughly
that
the
water
presently
came
gushing
into
the
boat
in
great
streams
whereat
all
hands
pulled
for
the
galleon
as
though
every
next
moment
was
to
be
their
last
and
what
do
you
suppose
were
our
hero
emotions
at
this
time
like
all
in
the
boat
his
awe
of
captain
morgan
was
so
great
that
i
do
believe
he
would
rather
have
gone
to
the
bottom
than
have
questioned
his
command
even
when
it
was
to
scuttle
the
boat
nevertheless
when
he
felt
the
cold
water
gushing
about
his
feet
for
he
had
taken
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
he
became
possessed
with
such
a
fear
of
being
drowned
that
even
the
spanish
galleon
had
no
terrors
for
him
if
he
could
only
feel
the
solid
planks
thereof
beneath
his
feet
indeed
all
the
crew
appeared
to
be
possessed
of
a
like
dismay
for
they
pulled
at
the
oars
with
such
an
incredible
force
that
they
were
under
the
quarter
of
the
galleon
before
the
boat
was
half
filled
with
water
here
as
they
approached
it
then
being
pretty
dark
and
the
moon
not
yet
having
risen
the
watch
upon
the
deck
hailed
them
whereupon
captain
morgan
called
out
in
spanish
that
he
was
captain
alvarez
mendazo
and
that
he
brought
despatches
for
the
but
at
that
moment
the
boat
being
now
so
full
of
water
as
to
be
logged
it
suddenly
tilted
upon
one
side
as
though
to
sink
beneath
them
whereupon
all
hands
without
further
orders
went
scrambling
up
the
side
as
nimble
as
so
many
monkeys
each
armed
with
a
pistol
in
one
hand
and
a
cutlass
in
the
other
and
so
were
upon
deck
before
the
watch
could
collect
his
wits
to
utter
any
outcry
or
to
give
any
other
alarm
than
to
cry
out
jesu
bless
us
who
are
these
at
which
words
somebody
knocked
him
down
with
the
butt
of
a
pistol
though
who
it
was
our
hero
could
not
tell
in
the
darkness
and
the
hurry
before
any
of
those
upon
deck
could
recover
from
their
alarm
or
those
from
below
come
up
upon
deck
a
part
of
the
pirates
under
the
carpenter
and
the
surgeon
had
run
to
the
gunroom
and
had
taken
possession
of
the
arms
while
captain
morgan
with
master
harry
and
a
portuguese
called
murillo
braziliano
had
flown
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
into
the
great
cabin
here
they
found
the
captain
of
the
playing
at
cards
with
the
sieur
simon
and
a
friend
madam
simon
and
her
daughter
being
present
captain
morgan
instantly
set
his
pistol
at
the
breast
of
the
spanish
captain
swearing
with
a
most
horrible
fierce
countenance
that
if
he
spake
a
word
or
made
any
outcry
he
was
a
dead
man
as
for
our
hero
having
now
got
his
hand
into
the
game
he
performed
the
same
service
for
the
spaniard
friend
declaring
he
would
shoot
him
dead
if
he
opened
his
lips
or
lifted
so
much
as
a
single
finger
all
this
while
the
ladies
not
comprehending
what
had
occurred
had
sat
as
mute
as
stones
but
now
having
so
far
recovered
themselves
as
to
find
a
voice
the
younger
of
the
two
fell
to
screaming
at
which
the
sieur
simon
called
out
to
her
to
be
still
for
these
were
friends
who
had
come
to
help
them
and
not
enemies
who
had
come
to
harm
them
all
this
you
are
to
understand
occupied
only
a
little
while
for
in
less
than
a
minute
three
or
four
of
the
pirates
had
come
into
the
cabin
who
together
with
the
portuguese
proceeded
at
once
to
bind
the
two
spaniards
hand
and
foot
and
to
gag
them
this
being
done
to
our
buccaneer
satisfaction
and
the
spanish
captain
being
stretched
out
in
the
corner
of
the
cabin
he
instantly
cleared
his
countenance
of
its
terrors
and
bursting
forth
into
a
great
loud
laugh
clapped
his
hand
to
the
sieur
simon
which
he
wrung
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
having
done
this
and
being
in
a
fine
humor
after
this
his
first
success
he
turned
to
the
two
ladies
and
this
ladies
said
he
taking
our
hero
by
the
hand
and
presenting
him
is
a
young
gentleman
who
has
embarked
with
me
to
learn
the
trade
of
piracy
i
recommend
him
to
your
politeness
think
what
a
confusion
this
threw
our
master
harry
into
to
be
sure
who
at
his
best
was
never
easy
in
the
company
of
strange
ladies
you
may
suppose
what
must
have
been
his
emotions
to
find
himself
thus
introduced
to
the
attention
of
madam
simon
and
her
daughter
being
at
the
time
in
his
bare
feet
clad
only
in
his
shirt
and
breeches
and
with
no
hat
upon
his
head
a
pistol
in
one
hand
and
a
cutlass
in
the
other
however
he
was
not
left
for
long
to
his
embarrassments
for
almost
immediately
after
he
had
thus
far
relaxed
captain
morgan
fell
of
a
sudden
serious
again
and
bidding
the
sieur
simon
to
get
his
ladies
away
into
some
place
of
safety
for
the
most
hazardous
part
of
this
adventure
was
yet
to
occur
he
quitted
the
cabin
with
master
harry
and
the
other
pirates
for
you
may
call
him
a
pirate
now
at
his
heels
having
come
upon
deck
our
hero
beheld
that
a
part
of
the
spanish
crew
were
huddled
forward
in
a
flock
like
so
many
sheep
the
others
being
crowded
below
with
the
hatches
fastened
upon
them
and
such
was
the
terror
of
the
pirates
and
so
dreadful
the
name
of
henry
morgan
that
not
one
of
those
poor
wretches
dared
to
lift
up
his
voice
to
give
any
alarm
nor
even
to
attempt
an
escape
by
jumping
overboard
at
captain
morgan
orders
these
men
together
with
certain
of
his
own
company
ran
nimbly
aloft
and
began
setting
the
sails
which
the
night
now
having
fallen
pretty
thick
was
not
for
a
good
while
observed
by
any
of
the
vessels
riding
at
anchor
about
them
indeed
the
pirates
might
have
made
good
their
escape
with
at
most
only
a
shot
or
two
from
the
had
it
not
then
been
about
the
full
of
the
moon
which
having
arisen
presently
discovered
to
those
of
the
fleet
that
lay
closest
about
them
what
was
being
done
aboard
the
at
this
one
of
the
vessels
hailed
them
and
then
after
a
while
having
no
reply
hailed
them
again
even
then
the
spaniards
might
not
immediately
have
suspected
anything
was
amiss
but
only
that
the
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
was
shifting
his
anchorage
had
not
one
of
the
spaniards
aloft
but
who
it
was
captain
morgan
was
never
able
to
discover
answered
the
hail
by
crying
out
that
the
had
been
seized
by
the
pirates
at
this
the
alarm
was
instantly
given
and
the
mischief
done
for
presently
there
was
a
tremendous
bustle
through
that
part
of
the
fleet
lying
nighest
the
a
deal
of
shouting
of
orders
a
beating
of
drums
and
the
running
hither
and
thither
of
the
crews
but
by
this
time
the
sails
of
the
had
filled
with
a
strong
land
breeze
that
was
blowing
up
the
harbor
whereupon
the
carpenter
at
captain
morgan
orders
having
cut
away
both
anchors
the
galleon
presently
bore
away
up
the
harbor
gathering
headway
every
moment
with
the
wind
nearly
dead
astern
the
nearest
vessel
was
the
only
one
that
for
the
moment
was
able
to
offer
any
hinderance
this
ship
having
by
this
time
cleared
away
one
of
its
guns
was
able
to
fire
a
parting
shot
against
the
striking
her
somewhere
forward
as
our
hero
could
see
by
a
great
shower
of
splinters
that
flew
up
in
the
moonlight
at
the
sound
of
the
shot
all
the
vessels
of
the
flota
not
yet
disturbed
by
the
alarm
were
aroused
at
once
so
that
the
pirates
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
they
would
have
to
run
the
gantlet
of
all
the
ships
between
them
and
the
open
sea
before
they
could
reckon
themselves
escaped
and
indeed
to
our
hero
mind
it
seemed
that
the
battle
which
followed
must
have
been
the
most
terrific
cannonade
that
was
ever
heard
in
the
world
it
was
not
so
ill
at
first
for
it
was
some
while
before
the
spaniards
could
get
their
guns
clear
for
action
they
being
not
the
least
in
the
world
prepared
for
such
an
occasion
as
this
but
first
one
and
then
another
ship
opened
fire
upon
the
galleon
until
it
seemed
to
our
hero
that
all
the
thunders
of
heaven
let
loose
upon
them
could
not
have
created
a
more
prodigious
uproar
and
that
it
was
not
possible
that
they
could
any
of
them
escape
destruction
by
now
the
moon
had
risen
full
and
round
so
that
the
clouds
of
smoke
that
rose
in
the
air
appeared
as
white
as
snow
the
air
seemed
full
of
the
hiss
and
screaming
of
shot
each
one
of
which
when
it
struck
the
galleon
was
magnified
by
our
hero
imagination
into
ten
times
its
magnitude
from
the
crash
which
it
delivered
and
from
the
cloud
of
splinters
it
would
cast
up
into
the
moonlight
at
last
he
suddenly
beheld
one
poor
man
knocked
sprawling
across
the
deck
who
as
he
raised
his
arm
from
behind
the
mast
disclosed
that
the
hand
was
gone
from
it
and
that
the
was
red
with
blood
in
the
moonlight
at
this
sight
all
the
strength
fell
away
from
poor
harry
and
he
felt
sure
that
a
like
fate
or
even
a
worse
must
be
in
store
for
him
but
after
all
this
was
nothing
to
what
it
might
have
been
in
broad
daylight
for
what
with
the
darkness
of
night
and
the
little
preparation
the
spaniards
could
make
for
such
a
business
and
the
extreme
haste
with
which
they
discharged
their
guns
many
not
understanding
what
was
the
occasion
of
all
this
uproar
nearly
all
the
shot
flew
so
wide
of
the
mark
that
not
above
one
in
twenty
struck
that
at
which
it
was
aimed
meantime
captain
morgan
with
the
sieur
simon
who
had
followed
him
upon
deck
stood
just
above
where
our
hero
lay
behind
the
shelter
of
the
bulwark
the
captain
had
lit
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
he
stood
now
in
the
bright
moonlight
close
to
the
rail
with
his
hands
behind
him
looking
out
ahead
with
the
utmost
coolness
imaginable
and
paying
no
more
attention
to
the
din
of
battle
than
though
it
were
twenty
leagues
away
now
and
then
he
would
take
his
pipe
from
his
lips
to
utter
an
order
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
excepting
this
he
stood
there
hardly
moving
at
all
the
wind
blowing
his
long
red
hair
over
his
shoulders
had
it
not
been
for
the
armed
galley
the
pirates
might
have
got
the
galleon
away
with
no
great
harm
done
in
spite
of
all
this
cannonading
for
the
which
rode
at
anchor
nighest
to
them
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
was
still
so
far
away
that
they
might
have
passed
it
by
hugging
pretty
close
to
the
shore
and
that
without
any
great
harm
being
done
to
them
in
the
darkness
but
just
at
this
moment
when
the
open
water
lay
in
sight
came
this
galley
pulling
out
from
behind
the
point
of
the
shore
in
such
a
manner
as
either
to
head
our
pirates
off
entirely
or
else
to
compel
them
to
approach
so
near
to
the
that
that
latter
vessel
could
bring
its
guns
to
bear
with
more
effect
this
galley
i
must
tell
you
was
like
others
of
its
kind
such
as
you
may
find
in
these
waters
the
hull
being
long
and
cut
low
to
the
water
so
as
to
allow
the
oars
to
dip
freely
the
bow
was
sharp
and
projected
far
out
ahead
mounting
a
swivel
upon
it
while
at
the
stern
a
number
of
galleries
built
one
above
another
into
a
castle
gave
shelter
to
several
companies
of
musketeers
as
well
as
the
officers
commanding
them
our
hero
could
behold
the
approach
of
this
galley
from
above
the
starboard
bulwarks
and
it
appeared
to
him
impossible
for
them
to
hope
to
escape
either
it
or
the
but
still
captain
morgan
maintained
the
same
composure
that
he
had
exhibited
all
the
while
only
now
and
then
delivering
an
order
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
who
putting
the
helm
over
threw
the
bows
of
the
galleon
around
more
to
the
larboard
as
though
to
escape
the
bow
of
the
galley
and
get
into
the
open
water
beyond
this
course
brought
the
pirates
ever
closer
and
closer
to
the
which
now
began
to
add
its
thunder
to
the
din
of
the
battle
and
with
so
much
more
effect
that
at
every
discharge
you
might
hear
the
crashing
and
crackling
of
splintered
wood
and
now
and
then
the
outcry
or
groaning
of
some
man
who
was
hurt
indeed
had
it
been
daylight
they
must
at
this
juncture
all
have
perished
though
as
was
said
what
with
the
night
and
the
confusion
and
the
hurry
they
escaped
entire
destruction
though
more
by
a
miracle
than
through
any
policy
upon
their
own
part
meantime
the
galley
steering
as
though
to
come
aboard
of
them
had
now
come
so
near
that
it
too
presently
began
to
open
its
musketry
fire
upon
them
so
that
the
humming
and
rattling
of
bullets
were
presently
added
to
the
din
of
cannonading
in
two
minutes
more
it
would
have
been
aboard
of
them
when
in
a
moment
captain
morgan
roared
out
of
a
sudden
to
the
man
at
the
helm
to
put
it
hard
a
starboard
in
response
the
man
ran
the
wheel
over
with
the
utmost
quickness
and
the
galleon
obeying
her
helm
very
readily
came
around
upon
a
course
which
if
continued
would
certainly
bring
them
into
collision
with
their
enemy
it
is
possible
at
first
the
spaniards
imagined
the
pirates
intended
to
escape
past
their
stern
for
they
instantly
began
backing
oars
to
keep
them
from
getting
past
so
that
the
water
was
all
of
a
foam
about
them
at
the
same
time
they
did
this
they
poured
in
such
a
fire
of
musketry
that
it
was
a
miracle
that
no
more
execution
was
accomplished
than
happened
as
for
our
hero
methinks
for
the
moment
he
forgot
all
about
everything
else
than
as
to
whether
or
no
his
captain
manoeuvre
would
succeed
for
in
the
very
first
moment
he
divined
as
by
some
instinct
what
captain
morgan
purposed
doing
at
this
moment
so
particular
in
the
execution
of
this
nice
design
a
bullet
suddenly
struck
down
the
man
at
the
wheel
hearing
the
sharp
outcry
our
harry
turned
to
see
him
fall
forward
and
then
to
his
hands
and
knees
upon
the
deck
the
blood
running
in
a
black
pool
beneath
him
while
the
wheel
escaping
from
his
hands
spun
over
until
the
spokes
were
all
of
a
mist
in
a
moment
the
ship
would
have
fallen
off
before
the
wind
had
not
our
hero
leaping
to
the
wheel
even
as
captain
morgan
shouted
an
order
for
some
one
to
do
so
seized
the
flying
spokes
whirling
them
back
again
and
so
bringing
the
bow
of
the
galleon
up
to
its
former
course
illustration
our
hero
leaping
to
the
wheel
seized
the
flying
spokes
in
the
first
moment
of
this
effort
he
had
reckoned
of
nothing
but
of
carrying
out
his
captain
designs
he
neither
thought
of
nor
of
bullets
but
now
that
his
task
was
accomplished
he
came
suddenly
back
to
himself
to
find
the
galleries
of
the
galleon
aflame
with
and
to
become
aware
with
a
most
horrible
sinking
of
the
spirits
that
all
the
shots
therefrom
were
intended
for
him
he
cast
his
eyes
about
him
with
despair
but
no
one
came
to
ease
him
of
his
task
which
having
undertaken
he
had
too
much
spirit
to
resign
from
carrying
through
to
the
end
though
he
was
well
aware
that
the
very
next
instant
might
mean
his
sudden
and
violent
death
his
ears
hummed
and
rang
and
his
brain
swam
as
light
as
a
feather
i
know
not
whether
he
breathed
but
he
shut
his
eyes
tight
as
though
that
might
save
him
from
the
bullets
that
were
raining
about
him
at
this
moment
the
spaniards
must
have
discovered
for
the
first
time
the
pirates
design
for
of
a
sudden
they
ceased
firing
and
began
to
shout
out
a
multitude
of
orders
while
the
oars
lashed
the
water
all
about
with
a
foam
but
it
was
too
late
then
for
them
to
escape
for
within
a
couple
of
seconds
the
galleon
struck
her
enemy
a
blow
so
violent
upon
the
larboard
quarter
as
nearly
to
hurl
our
harry
upon
the
deck
and
then
with
a
dreadful
horrible
crackling
of
wood
commingled
with
a
yelling
of
men
voices
the
galley
was
swung
around
upon
her
side
and
the
galleon
sailing
into
the
open
sea
left
nothing
of
her
immediate
enemy
but
a
sinking
wreck
and
the
water
dotted
all
over
with
bobbing
heads
and
waving
hands
in
the
moonlight
and
now
indeed
that
all
danger
was
past
and
gone
there
were
plenty
to
come
running
to
help
our
hero
at
the
wheel
as
for
captain
morgan
having
come
down
upon
the
he
fetches
the
young
helmsman
a
clap
upon
the
back
well
master
harry
says
he
and
did
i
not
tell
you
i
would
make
a
man
of
you
whereat
our
poor
harry
fell
but
with
a
sad
catch
in
his
voice
for
his
hands
trembled
as
with
an
ague
and
were
as
cold
as
ice
as
for
his
emotions
god
knows
he
was
nearer
crying
than
laughing
if
captain
morgan
had
but
known
it
nevertheless
though
undertaken
under
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
protest
it
was
indeed
a
brave
deed
and
i
can
not
but
wonder
how
many
young
gentlemen
of
sixteen
there
are
who
upon
a
like
occasion
would
act
as
well
as
our
harry
v
the
balance
of
our
hero
adventures
were
of
a
lighter
sort
than
those
already
recounted
for
the
next
morning
the
spanish
captain
a
very
polite
and
gentleman
having
fitted
him
out
with
a
suit
of
his
own
clothes
master
harry
was
presented
in
a
proper
form
to
the
ladies
for
captain
morgan
if
he
had
felt
a
liking
for
the
young
man
before
could
not
now
show
sufficient
regard
for
him
he
ate
in
the
great
cabin
and
was
petted
by
all
madam
simon
who
was
a
fat
and
lady
was
forever
praising
him
and
the
young
miss
who
was
extremely
was
as
continually
making
eyes
at
him
she
and
master
harry
i
must
tell
you
would
spend
hours
together
she
making
pretence
of
teaching
him
french
although
he
was
so
possessed
with
a
passion
of
love
that
he
was
nigh
suffocated
with
it
she
upon
her
part
perceiving
his
emotions
responded
with
extreme
and
complacency
so
that
had
our
hero
been
older
and
the
voyage
proved
longer
he
might
have
become
entirely
enmeshed
in
the
toils
of
his
fair
siren
for
all
this
while
you
are
to
understand
the
pirates
were
making
sail
straight
for
jamaica
which
they
reached
upon
the
third
day
in
perfect
safety
illustration
she
and
master
harry
would
spend
hours
together
in
that
time
however
the
pirates
had
gone
crazy
for
joy
for
when
they
came
to
examine
their
purchase
they
discovered
her
cargo
to
consist
of
plate
to
the
prodigious
sum
of
in
value
was
a
wonder
they
did
not
all
make
themselves
drunk
for
joy
no
doubt
they
would
have
done
so
had
not
captain
morgan
knowing
they
were
still
in
the
exact
track
of
the
spanish
fleets
threatened
them
that
the
first
man
among
them
who
touched
a
drop
of
rum
without
his
permission
he
would
shoot
him
dead
upon
the
deck
this
threat
had
such
effect
that
they
all
remained
entirely
sober
until
they
had
reached
port
royal
harbor
which
they
did
about
nine
in
the
morning
and
now
it
was
that
our
hero
romance
came
all
tumbling
down
about
his
ears
with
a
run
for
they
had
hardly
come
to
anchor
in
the
harbor
when
a
boat
came
from
a
and
who
should
come
stepping
aboard
but
lieutenant
grantley
a
particular
friend
of
our
hero
father
and
his
own
eldest
brother
thomas
who
putting
on
a
very
stern
face
informed
master
harry
that
he
was
a
desperate
and
hardened
villain
who
was
sure
to
end
at
the
gallows
and
that
he
was
to
go
immediately
back
to
his
home
again
he
told
our
embryo
pirate
that
his
family
had
nigh
gone
distracted
because
of
his
wicked
and
ungrateful
conduct
nor
could
our
hero
move
him
from
his
inflexible
purpose
what
says
our
harry
and
will
you
not
then
let
me
wait
until
our
prize
is
divided
and
i
get
my
share
prize
indeed
says
his
brother
and
do
you
then
really
think
that
your
father
would
consent
to
your
having
a
share
in
this
terrible
bloody
and
murthering
business
and
so
after
a
good
deal
of
argument
our
hero
was
constrained
to
go
nor
did
he
even
have
an
opportunity
to
bid
adieu
to
his
inamorata
nor
did
he
see
her
any
more
except
from
a
distance
she
standing
on
the
as
he
was
rowed
away
from
her
her
face
all
stained
with
crying
for
himself
he
felt
that
there
was
no
more
joy
in
life
nevertheless
standing
up
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
he
made
shift
though
with
an
aching
heart
to
deliver
her
a
fine
bow
with
the
hat
he
had
borrowed
from
the
spanish
captain
before
his
brother
bade
him
sit
down
again
and
so
to
the
ending
of
this
story
with
only
this
to
relate
that
our
master
harry
so
far
from
going
to
the
gallows
became
in
good
time
a
respectable
and
wealthy
sugar
merchant
with
an
english
wife
and
a
fine
family
of
children
whereunto
when
the
mood
was
upon
him
he
has
sometimes
told
these
adventures
and
sundry
others
not
here
recounted
as
i
have
told
them
unto
you
ii
tom
chist
and
the
story
of
the
days
of
captain
to
tell
about
tom
chist
and
how
he
got
his
name
and
how
he
came
to
be
living
at
the
little
settlement
of
henlopen
just
inside
the
mouth
of
the
delaware
bay
the
story
must
begin
as
far
back
as
when
a
great
storm
swept
the
atlantic
coast
from
end
to
end
during
the
heaviest
part
of
the
hurricane
a
bark
went
ashore
on
the
shoals
just
below
cape
henlopen
and
at
the
mouth
of
the
delaware
bay
and
tom
chist
was
the
only
soul
of
all
those
on
board
the
vessel
who
escaped
alive
this
story
must
first
be
told
because
it
was
on
account
of
the
strange
and
miraculous
escape
that
happened
to
him
at
that
time
that
he
gained
the
name
that
was
given
to
him
even
as
late
as
that
time
of
the
american
colonies
the
little
scattered
settlement
at
henlopen
made
up
of
english
with
a
few
dutch
and
swedish
people
was
still
only
a
spot
upon
the
face
of
the
great
american
wilderness
that
spread
away
with
swamp
and
forest
no
man
knew
how
far
to
the
westward
that
wilderness
was
not
only
full
of
wild
beasts
but
of
indian
savages
who
every
fall
would
come
in
wandering
tribes
to
spend
the
winter
along
the
shores
of
the
lakes
below
henlopen
there
for
four
or
five
months
they
would
live
upon
fish
and
clams
and
wild
ducks
and
geese
chipping
their
and
making
their
earthenware
pots
and
pans
under
the
lee
of
the
and
pine
woods
below
the
capes
sometimes
on
sundays
when
the
rev
hillary
jones
would
be
preaching
in
the
little
log
church
back
in
the
woods
these
red
savages
would
come
in
from
the
cold
and
sit
squatting
in
the
back
part
of
the
church
listening
stolidly
to
the
words
that
had
no
meaning
for
them
but
about
the
wreck
of
the
bark
in
such
a
wreck
as
that
which
then
went
ashore
on
the
shoals
was
a
godsend
to
the
poor
and
needy
settlers
in
the
wilderness
where
so
few
good
things
ever
came
for
the
vessel
went
to
pieces
during
the
night
and
the
next
morning
the
beach
was
strewn
with
wreckage
boxes
and
barrels
chests
and
spars
timbers
and
planks
a
plentiful
and
bountiful
harvest
to
be
gathered
up
by
the
settlers
as
they
chose
with
no
one
to
forbid
or
prevent
them
the
name
of
the
bark
as
found
painted
on
some
of
the
and
was
the
and
she
no
doubt
hailed
from
england
as
was
said
the
only
soul
who
escaped
alive
off
the
wreck
was
tom
chist
a
settler
a
fisherman
named
matt
abrahamson
and
his
daughter
molly
found
tom
he
was
washed
up
on
the
beach
among
the
wreckage
in
a
great
wooden
box
which
had
been
securely
tied
around
with
a
rope
and
lashed
between
two
spars
apparently
for
better
protection
in
beating
through
the
surf
matt
abrahamson
thought
he
had
found
something
of
more
than
usual
value
when
he
came
upon
this
chest
but
when
he
cut
the
cords
and
broke
open
the
box
with
his
broadaxe
he
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
had
he
beheld
a
salamander
instead
of
a
baby
of
nine
or
ten
months
old
lying
half
smothered
in
the
blankets
that
covered
the
bottom
of
the
chest
matt
abrahamson
daughter
molly
had
had
a
baby
who
had
died
a
month
or
so
before
so
when
she
saw
the
little
one
lying
there
in
the
bottom
of
the
chest
she
cried
out
in
a
great
loud
voice
that
the
good
man
had
sent
her
another
baby
in
place
of
her
own
the
rain
was
driving
before
the
in
dim
slanting
sheets
and
so
she
wrapped
up
the
baby
in
the
man
coat
she
wore
and
ran
off
home
without
waiting
to
gather
up
any
more
of
the
wreckage
it
was
parson
jones
who
gave
the
foundling
his
name
when
the
news
came
to
his
ears
of
what
matt
abrahamson
had
found
he
went
over
to
the
fisherman
cabin
to
see
the
child
he
examined
the
clothes
in
which
the
baby
was
dressed
they
were
of
fine
linen
and
handsomely
stitched
and
the
reverend
gentleman
opined
that
the
foundling
parents
must
have
been
of
quality
a
kerchief
had
been
wrapped
around
the
neck
and
under
its
arms
and
tied
behind
and
in
the
corner
marked
with
very
fine
needlework
were
the
initials
what
d
call
him
molly
said
parson
jones
he
was
standing
as
he
spoke
with
his
back
to
the
fire
warming
his
palms
before
the
blaze
the
pocket
of
the
he
wore
bulged
out
with
a
big
of
spirits
which
he
had
gathered
up
out
of
the
wreck
that
afternoon
what
d
call
him
molly
i
call
him
tom
after
my
own
baby
that
goes
very
well
with
the
initial
on
the
kerchief
said
parson
jones
but
what
other
name
d
give
him
let
it
be
something
to
go
with
the
i
do
know
said
molly
why
not
call
him
since
he
was
born
in
a
chist
out
of
the
sea
chist
the
name
goes
off
like
a
flash
in
the
pan
and
so
tom
chist
he
was
called
and
tom
chist
he
was
christened
so
much
for
the
beginning
of
the
history
of
tom
chist
the
story
of
captain
kidd
does
not
begin
until
the
late
spring
of
that
was
the
year
that
the
famous
pirate
captain
coming
up
from
the
west
indies
sailed
his
sloop
into
the
delaware
bay
where
he
lay
for
over
a
month
waiting
for
news
from
his
friends
in
new
york
for
he
had
sent
word
to
that
town
asking
if
the
coast
was
clear
for
him
to
return
home
with
the
rich
prize
he
had
brought
from
the
indian
seas
and
the
coast
of
africa
and
meantime
he
lay
there
in
the
delaware
bay
waiting
for
a
reply
before
he
left
he
turned
the
whole
of
tom
life
with
something
that
he
brought
ashore
by
that
time
tom
chist
had
grown
into
a
boy
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
of
age
it
was
a
miserable
dog
life
he
lived
with
old
matt
abrahamson
for
the
old
fisherman
was
in
his
cups
more
than
half
the
time
and
when
he
was
so
there
was
hardly
a
day
passed
that
he
did
not
give
tom
a
curse
or
a
buffet
or
as
like
as
not
an
actual
beating
one
would
have
thought
that
such
treatment
would
have
broken
the
spirit
of
the
poor
little
foundling
but
it
had
just
the
opposite
effect
upon
tom
chist
who
was
one
of
your
stubborn
sturdy
fellows
who
only
grow
harder
and
more
tough
the
more
they
are
it
had
been
a
long
time
now
since
he
had
made
any
outcry
or
complaint
at
the
hard
usage
he
suffered
from
old
matt
at
such
times
he
would
shut
his
teeth
and
bear
whatever
came
to
him
until
sometimes
the
old
man
would
be
driven
almost
mad
by
his
stubborn
silence
maybe
he
would
stop
in
the
midst
of
the
beating
he
was
administering
and
grinding
his
teeth
would
cry
out
wo
ye
say
naught
wo
ye
say
naught
well
then
i
see
if
i
ca
make
ye
say
naught
when
things
had
reached
such
a
pass
as
this
molly
would
generally
interfere
to
protect
her
and
then
she
and
tom
would
together
fight
the
old
man
until
they
had
wrenched
the
stick
or
the
strap
out
of
his
hand
then
old
matt
would
chase
them
and
around
and
around
the
house
for
maybe
half
an
hour
until
his
anger
was
cool
when
he
would
go
back
again
and
for
a
time
the
storm
would
be
over
besides
his
tom
chist
had
a
very
good
friend
in
parson
jones
who
used
to
come
over
every
now
and
then
to
abrahamson
hut
upon
the
chance
of
getting
a
fish
for
breakfast
he
always
had
a
kind
word
or
two
for
tom
who
during
the
winter
evenings
would
go
over
to
the
good
man
house
to
learn
his
letters
and
to
read
and
write
and
cipher
a
little
so
that
by
now
he
was
able
to
spell
the
words
out
of
the
bible
and
the
almanac
and
knew
enough
to
change
tuppence
into
four
this
is
the
sort
of
boy
tom
chist
was
and
this
is
the
sort
of
life
he
led
in
the
late
spring
or
early
summer
of
captain
kidd
sloop
sailed
into
the
mouth
of
the
delaware
bay
and
changed
the
whole
fortune
of
his
life
and
this
is
how
you
come
to
the
story
of
captain
kidd
ii
old
matt
abrahamson
kept
the
boat
in
which
he
went
fishing
some
distance
down
the
shore
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
old
wreck
that
had
been
sunk
on
the
shoals
this
was
the
usual
of
the
settlers
and
here
old
matt
boat
generally
lay
drawn
up
on
the
sand
there
had
been
a
that
afternoon
and
tom
had
gone
down
the
beach
to
bale
out
the
boat
in
readiness
for
the
morning
fishing
it
was
full
moonlight
now
as
he
was
returning
and
the
night
sky
was
full
of
floating
clouds
now
and
then
there
was
a
dull
flash
to
the
westward
and
once
a
muttering
growl
of
thunder
promising
another
storm
to
come
all
that
day
the
pirate
sloop
had
been
lying
just
off
the
shore
back
of
the
capes
and
now
tom
chist
could
see
the
sails
glimmering
pallidly
in
the
moonlight
spread
for
drying
after
the
storm
he
was
walking
up
the
shore
homeward
when
he
became
aware
that
at
some
distance
ahead
of
him
there
was
a
ship
boat
drawn
up
on
the
little
narrow
beach
and
a
group
of
men
clustered
about
it
he
hurried
forward
with
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
to
see
who
had
landed
but
it
was
not
until
he
had
come
close
to
them
that
he
could
distinguish
who
and
what
they
were
then
he
knew
that
it
must
be
a
party
who
had
come
off
the
pirate
sloop
they
had
evidently
just
landed
and
two
men
were
lifting
out
a
chest
from
the
boat
one
of
them
was
a
negro
naked
to
the
waist
and
the
other
was
a
white
man
in
his
wearing
petticoat
breeches
a
monterey
cap
upon
his
head
a
red
bandanna
handkerchief
around
his
neck
and
gold
in
his
ears
he
had
a
long
plaited
queue
hanging
down
his
back
and
a
great
dangling
from
his
side
another
man
evidently
the
captain
of
the
party
stood
at
a
little
distance
as
they
lifted
the
chest
out
of
the
boat
he
had
a
cane
in
one
hand
and
a
lighted
lantern
in
the
other
although
the
moon
was
shining
as
bright
as
day
he
wore
and
a
handsome
laced
coat
and
he
had
a
long
drooping
mustache
that
curled
down
below
his
chin
he
wore
a
fine
feathered
hat
and
his
long
black
hair
hung
down
upon
his
shoulders
all
this
tom
chist
could
see
in
the
moonlight
that
glinted
and
twinkled
upon
the
gilt
buttons
of
his
coat
they
were
so
busy
lifting
the
chest
from
the
boat
that
at
first
they
did
not
observe
that
tom
chist
had
come
up
and
was
standing
there
it
was
the
white
man
with
the
long
plaited
queue
and
the
gold
that
spoke
to
him
boy
what
do
you
want
here
boy
he
said
in
a
rough
hoarse
voice
where
d
come
from
and
then
dropping
his
end
of
the
chest
and
without
giving
tom
time
to
answer
he
pointed
off
down
the
beach
and
said
you
better
be
going
about
your
own
business
if
you
know
what
good
for
you
and
do
you
come
back
or
you
find
what
you
do
want
waiting
for
you
tom
saw
in
a
glance
that
the
pirates
were
all
looking
at
him
and
then
without
saying
a
word
he
turned
and
walked
away
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
him
followed
him
threateningly
for
some
little
distance
as
though
to
see
that
he
had
gone
away
as
he
was
bidden
to
do
but
presently
he
stopped
and
tom
hurried
on
alone
until
the
boat
and
the
crew
and
all
were
dropped
away
behind
and
lost
in
the
moonlight
night
then
he
himself
stopped
also
turned
and
looked
back
whence
he
had
come
there
had
been
something
very
strange
in
the
appearance
of
the
men
he
had
just
seen
something
very
mysterious
in
their
actions
and
he
wondered
what
it
all
meant
and
what
they
were
going
to
do
he
stood
for
a
little
while
thus
looking
and
listening
he
could
see
nothing
and
could
hear
only
the
sound
of
distant
talking
what
were
they
doing
on
the
lonely
shore
thus
at
night
then
following
a
sudden
impulse
he
turned
and
cut
off
across
the
skirting
around
inland
but
keeping
pretty
close
to
the
shore
his
object
being
to
spy
upon
them
and
to
watch
what
they
were
about
from
the
back
of
the
low
that
fronted
the
beach
he
had
gone
along
some
distance
in
his
circuitous
return
when
he
became
aware
of
the
sound
of
voices
that
seemed
to
be
drawing
closer
to
him
as
he
came
towards
the
speakers
he
stopped
and
stood
listening
and
instantly
as
he
stopped
the
voices
stopped
also
he
crouched
there
silently
in
the
bright
glimmering
moonlight
surrounded
by
the
silent
stretches
of
sand
and
the
stillness
seemed
to
press
upon
him
like
a
heavy
hand
then
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
man
voice
began
again
and
as
tom
listened
he
could
hear
some
one
slowly
counting
the
voice
began
one
hundred
one
hundred
and
one
the
slow
monotonous
count
coming
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
one
hundred
and
two
one
hundred
and
three
one
hundred
and
four
and
so
on
in
its
monotonous
reckoning
suddenly
he
saw
three
heads
appear
above
the
so
close
to
him
that
he
crouched
down
quickly
with
a
keen
thrill
close
beside
the
hummock
near
which
he
stood
his
first
fear
was
that
they
might
have
seen
him
in
the
moonlight
but
they
had
not
and
his
heart
rose
again
as
the
counting
voice
went
steadily
on
one
hundred
and
twenty
it
was
saying
and
and
and
and
and
then
he
who
was
counting
came
out
from
behind
the
little
sandy
rise
into
the
white
and
open
level
of
shimmering
brightness
illustration
and
and
it
was
the
man
with
the
cane
whom
tom
had
seen
some
time
before
the
captain
of
the
party
who
had
landed
he
carried
his
cane
under
his
arm
now
and
was
holding
his
lantern
close
to
something
that
he
held
in
his
hand
and
upon
which
he
looked
narrowly
as
he
walked
with
a
slow
and
measured
tread
in
a
perfectly
straight
line
across
the
sand
counting
each
step
as
he
took
it
and
and
and
and
and
and
thirty
behind
him
walked
two
other
figures
one
was
the
negro
the
other
the
man
with
the
plaited
queue
and
the
whom
tom
had
seen
lifting
the
chest
out
of
the
boat
now
they
were
carrying
the
heavy
box
between
them
laboring
through
the
sand
with
shuffling
tread
as
they
bore
it
onward
as
he
who
was
counting
pronounced
the
word
thirty
the
two
men
set
the
chest
down
on
the
sand
with
a
grunt
the
white
man
panting
and
blowing
and
wiping
his
sleeve
across
his
forehead
and
immediately
he
who
counted
took
out
a
slip
of
paper
and
marked
something
down
upon
it
they
stood
there
for
a
long
time
during
which
tom
lay
behind
the
watching
them
and
for
a
while
the
silence
was
uninterrupted
in
the
perfect
stillness
tom
could
hear
the
washing
of
the
little
waves
beating
upon
the
distant
beach
and
once
the
sound
of
a
laugh
from
one
of
those
who
stood
by
the
ship
boat
one
two
three
minutes
passed
and
then
the
men
picked
up
the
chest
and
started
on
again
and
then
again
the
other
man
began
his
counting
thirty
and
one
and
thirty
and
two
and
thirty
and
three
and
thirty
and
four
he
walked
straight
across
the
level
open
still
looking
intently
at
that
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
thirty
and
five
and
thirty
and
six
and
thirty
and
seven
and
so
on
until
the
three
figures
disappeared
in
the
little
hollow
between
the
two
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
open
and
still
tom
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
counting
voice
in
the
distance
just
as
they
disappeared
behind
the
hill
there
was
a
sudden
faint
flash
of
light
and
as
tom
lay
still
listening
to
the
counting
he
heard
after
a
long
interval
a
muffled
rumble
of
distant
thunder
he
waited
for
a
while
and
then
arose
and
stepped
to
the
top
of
the
behind
which
he
had
been
lying
he
looked
all
about
him
but
there
was
no
one
else
to
be
seen
then
he
stepped
down
from
the
hummock
and
followed
in
the
direction
which
the
pirate
captain
and
the
two
men
carrying
the
chest
had
gone
he
crept
along
cautiously
stopping
now
and
then
to
make
sure
that
he
still
heard
the
counting
voice
and
when
it
ceased
he
lay
down
upon
the
sand
and
waited
until
it
began
again
presently
so
following
the
pirates
he
saw
the
three
figures
again
in
the
distance
and
skirting
around
back
of
a
hill
of
sand
covered
with
coarse
he
came
to
where
he
overlooked
a
little
open
level
space
gleaming
white
in
the
moonlight
the
three
had
been
crossing
the
level
of
sand
and
were
now
not
more
than
paces
from
him
they
had
again
set
down
the
chest
upon
which
the
white
man
with
the
long
queue
and
the
gold
had
seated
to
rest
himself
the
negro
standing
close
beside
him
the
moon
shone
as
bright
as
day
and
full
upon
his
face
it
was
looking
directly
at
tom
chist
every
line
as
keen
cut
with
white
lights
and
black
shadows
as
though
it
had
been
carved
in
ivory
and
jet
he
sat
perfectly
motionless
and
tom
drew
back
with
a
start
almost
thinking
he
had
been
discovered
he
lay
silent
his
heart
beating
heavily
in
his
throat
but
there
was
no
alarm
and
presently
he
heard
the
counting
begin
again
and
when
he
looked
once
more
he
saw
they
were
going
away
straight
across
the
little
open
a
soft
sliding
hillock
of
sand
lay
directly
in
front
of
them
they
did
not
turn
aside
but
went
straight
over
it
the
leader
helping
himself
up
the
sandy
slope
with
his
cane
still
counting
and
still
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
upon
that
which
he
held
in
his
hand
then
they
disappeared
again
behind
the
white
crest
on
the
other
side
so
tom
followed
them
cautiously
until
they
had
gone
almost
half
a
mile
inland
when
next
he
saw
them
clearly
it
was
from
a
little
sandy
rise
which
looked
down
like
the
crest
of
a
bowl
upon
the
floor
of
sand
below
upon
this
smooth
white
floor
the
moon
beat
with
almost
dazzling
brightness
the
white
man
who
had
helped
to
carry
the
chest
was
now
kneeling
busied
at
some
work
though
what
it
was
tom
at
first
could
not
see
he
was
whittling
the
point
of
a
stick
into
a
long
wooden
peg
and
when
he
had
finished
what
he
was
about
he
arose
and
stepped
to
where
he
who
seemed
to
be
the
captain
had
stuck
his
cane
upright
into
the
ground
as
though
to
mark
some
particular
spot
he
drew
the
cane
out
of
the
sand
thrusting
the
stick
down
in
its
stead
then
he
drove
the
long
peg
down
with
a
wooden
mallet
which
the
negro
handed
to
him
the
sharp
rapping
of
the
mallet
upon
the
top
of
the
peg
sounded
loud
in
the
perfect
stillness
and
tom
lay
watching
and
wondering
what
it
all
meant
the
man
with
blows
drove
the
peg
farther
and
farther
down
into
the
sand
until
it
showed
only
two
or
three
inches
above
the
surface
as
he
finished
his
work
there
was
another
faint
flash
of
light
and
another
smothered
rumble
of
thunder
and
tom
as
he
looked
out
towards
the
westward
saw
the
silver
rim
of
the
round
and
sharply
outlined
thundercloud
rising
slowly
up
into
the
sky
and
pushing
the
other
and
broken
drifting
clouds
before
it
the
two
white
men
were
now
stooping
over
the
peg
the
negro
man
watching
them
then
presently
the
man
with
the
cane
started
straight
away
from
the
peg
carrying
the
end
of
a
with
him
the
other
end
of
which
the
man
with
the
plaited
queue
held
against
the
top
of
the
peg
when
the
pirate
captain
had
reached
the
end
of
the
he
marked
a
cross
upon
the
sand
and
then
again
they
measured
out
another
stretch
of
space
so
they
measured
a
distance
five
times
over
and
then
from
where
tom
lay
he
could
see
the
man
with
the
queue
drive
another
peg
just
at
the
foot
of
a
sloping
rise
of
sand
that
swept
up
beyond
into
a
tall
white
dune
marked
sharp
and
clear
against
the
night
sky
behind
as
soon
as
the
man
with
the
plaited
queue
had
driven
the
second
peg
into
the
ground
they
began
measuring
again
and
so
still
measuring
disappeared
in
another
direction
which
took
them
in
behind
the
where
tom
no
longer
could
see
what
they
were
doing
the
negro
still
sat
by
the
chest
where
the
two
had
left
him
and
so
bright
was
the
moonlight
that
from
where
he
lay
tom
could
see
the
glint
of
it
twinkling
in
the
whites
of
his
eyeballs
presently
from
behind
the
hill
there
came
for
the
third
time
the
sharp
rapping
sound
of
the
mallet
driving
still
another
peg
and
then
after
a
while
the
two
pirates
emerged
from
behind
the
sloping
whiteness
into
the
space
of
moonlight
again
they
came
direct
to
where
the
chest
lay
and
the
white
man
and
the
black
man
lifting
it
once
more
they
walked
away
across
the
level
of
open
sand
and
so
on
behind
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
out
of
sight
iii
tom
chist
could
no
longer
see
what
the
pirates
were
doing
neither
did
he
dare
to
cross
over
the
open
space
of
sand
that
now
lay
between
them
and
him
he
lay
there
speculating
as
to
what
they
were
about
and
meantime
the
storm
cloud
was
rising
higher
and
higher
above
the
horizon
with
louder
and
louder
mutterings
of
thunder
following
each
dull
flash
from
out
the
cloudy
cavernous
depths
in
the
silence
he
could
hear
an
occasional
click
as
of
some
iron
implement
and
he
opined
that
the
pirates
were
burying
the
chest
though
just
where
they
were
at
work
he
could
neither
see
nor
tell
still
he
lay
there
watching
and
listening
and
a
puff
of
warm
air
blew
across
the
sand
and
a
thumping
tumble
of
louder
thunder
leaped
from
out
the
belly
of
the
storm
cloud
which
every
minute
was
coming
nearer
and
nearer
still
tom
chist
lay
watching
suddenly
almost
unexpectedly
the
three
figures
reappeared
from
behind
the
the
pirate
captain
leading
the
way
and
the
negro
and
white
man
following
close
behind
him
they
had
gone
about
across
the
white
sandy
level
between
the
hill
and
the
hummock
behind
which
tom
chist
lay
when
the
white
man
stopped
and
bent
over
as
though
to
tie
his
shoe
this
brought
the
negro
a
few
steps
in
front
of
his
companion
that
which
then
followed
happened
so
suddenly
so
unexpectedly
so
swiftly
that
tom
chist
had
hardly
time
to
realize
what
it
all
meant
before
it
was
over
as
the
negro
passed
him
the
white
man
arose
suddenly
and
silently
erect
and
tom
chist
saw
the
white
moonlight
glint
upon
the
blade
of
a
great
which
he
now
held
in
his
hand
he
took
one
two
silent
catlike
steps
behind
the
unsuspecting
negro
then
there
was
a
sweeping
flash
of
the
blade
in
the
pallid
light
and
a
blow
the
thump
of
which
tom
could
distinctly
hear
even
from
where
he
lay
stretched
out
upon
the
sand
there
was
an
instant
echoing
yell
from
the
black
man
who
ran
stumbling
forward
who
stopped
who
regained
his
footing
and
then
stood
for
an
instant
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
tom
had
distinctly
seen
the
knife
enter
his
back
and
even
thought
that
he
had
seen
the
glint
of
the
point
as
it
came
out
from
the
breast
meantime
the
pirate
captain
had
stopped
and
now
stood
with
his
hand
resting
upon
his
cane
looking
impassively
on
then
the
black
man
started
to
run
the
white
man
stood
for
a
while
glaring
after
him
then
he
too
started
after
his
victim
upon
the
run
the
black
man
was
not
very
far
from
tom
when
he
staggered
and
fell
he
tried
to
rise
then
fell
forward
again
and
lay
at
length
at
that
instant
the
first
edge
of
the
cloud
cut
across
the
moon
and
there
was
a
sudden
darkness
but
in
the
silence
tom
heard
the
sound
of
another
blow
and
a
groan
and
then
presently
a
voice
calling
to
the
pirate
captain
that
it
was
all
over
he
saw
the
dim
form
of
the
captain
crossing
the
level
sand
and
then
as
the
moon
sailed
out
from
behind
the
cloud
he
saw
the
white
man
standing
over
a
black
figure
that
lay
motionless
upon
the
sand
then
tom
chist
scrambled
up
and
ran
away
plunging
down
into
the
hollow
of
sand
that
lay
in
the
shadows
below
over
the
next
rise
he
ran
and
down
again
into
the
next
black
hollow
and
so
on
over
the
sliding
shifting
ground
panting
and
gasping
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
hear
footsteps
following
and
in
the
terror
that
possessed
him
he
almost
expected
every
instant
to
feel
the
cold
slide
between
his
own
ribs
in
such
a
thrust
from
behind
as
he
had
seen
given
to
the
poor
black
man
so
he
ran
on
like
one
in
a
nightmare
his
feet
grew
heavy
like
lead
he
panted
and
gasped
his
breath
came
hot
and
dry
in
his
throat
but
still
he
ran
and
ran
until
at
last
he
found
himself
in
front
of
old
matt
abrahamson
cabin
gasping
panting
and
sobbing
for
breath
his
knees
relaxed
and
his
thighs
trembling
with
weakness
as
he
opened
the
door
and
dashed
into
the
darkened
cabin
for
both
matt
and
molly
were
long
ago
asleep
in
bed
there
was
a
flash
of
light
and
even
as
he
slammed
to
the
door
behind
him
there
was
an
instant
peal
of
thunder
heavy
as
though
a
great
weight
had
been
dropped
upon
the
roof
of
the
sky
so
that
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
cabin
rattled
iv
then
tom
chist
crept
to
bed
trembling
shuddering
bathed
in
sweat
his
heart
beating
like
a
and
his
brain
dizzy
from
that
long
race
through
the
soft
sand
in
which
he
had
striven
to
outstrip
he
knew
not
what
pursuing
horror
for
a
long
long
time
he
lay
awake
trembling
and
chattering
with
nervous
chills
and
when
he
did
fall
asleep
it
was
only
to
drop
into
monstrous
dreams
in
which
he
once
again
saw
ever
enacted
with
various
grotesque
variations
the
tragic
drama
which
his
waking
eyes
had
beheld
the
night
before
then
came
the
dawning
of
the
broad
wet
daylight
and
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
tom
was
up
and
to
find
the
young
day
dripping
with
the
rain
of
overnight
his
first
act
was
to
climb
the
nearest
sandhill
and
to
gaze
out
towards
the
offing
where
the
pirate
ship
had
been
the
day
before
it
was
no
longer
there
soon
afterwards
matt
abrahamson
came
out
of
the
cabin
and
he
called
to
tom
to
go
get
a
bite
to
eat
for
it
was
time
for
them
to
be
away
fishing
all
that
morning
the
recollection
of
the
night
before
hung
over
tom
chist
like
a
great
cloud
of
boding
trouble
it
filled
the
confined
area
of
the
little
boat
and
spread
over
the
entire
wide
spaces
of
sky
and
sea
that
surrounded
them
not
for
a
moment
was
it
lifted
even
when
he
was
hauling
in
his
wet
and
dripping
line
with
a
struggling
fish
at
the
end
of
it
a
recurrent
memory
of
what
he
had
seen
would
suddenly
come
upon
him
and
he
would
groan
in
spirit
at
the
recollection
he
looked
at
matt
abrahamson
leathery
face
at
his
lantern
jaws
cavernously
and
stolidly
chewing
at
a
tobacco
leaf
and
it
seemed
monstrous
to
him
that
the
old
man
should
be
so
unconscious
of
the
black
cloud
that
wrapped
them
all
about
when
the
boat
reached
the
shore
again
he
leaped
scrambling
to
the
beach
and
as
soon
as
his
dinner
was
eaten
he
hurried
away
to
find
the
dominie
jones
he
ran
all
the
way
from
abrahamson
hut
to
the
parson
house
hardly
stopping
once
and
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
he
was
panting
and
sobbing
for
breath
the
good
man
was
sitting
on
the
smoking
his
long
pipe
of
tobacco
out
into
the
sunlight
while
his
wife
within
was
rattling
about
among
the
pans
and
dishes
in
preparation
of
their
supper
of
which
a
strong
porky
smell
already
filled
the
air
then
tom
chist
told
his
story
panting
hurrying
tumbling
one
word
over
another
in
his
haste
and
parson
jones
listened
breaking
every
now
and
then
into
an
ejaculation
of
wonder
the
light
in
his
pipe
went
out
and
the
bowl
turned
cold
and
i
do
see
why
they
should
have
killed
the
poor
black
man
said
tom
as
he
finished
his
narrative
why
that
is
very
easy
enough
to
understand
said
the
good
reverend
man
was
a
they
buried
in
his
agitation
jones
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
was
now
stumping
up
and
down
puffing
at
his
empty
as
though
it
were
still
alight
a
cried
out
tom
aye
a
and
that
was
why
they
killed
the
poor
black
man
he
was
the
only
one
d
see
besides
they
two
who
knew
the
place
where
was
hid
and
now
that
they
killed
him
out
of
the
way
there
nobody
but
themselves
knows
the
villains
tut
tut
look
at
that
now
in
his
excitement
the
dominie
had
snapped
the
stem
of
his
in
two
why
then
said
tom
if
that
is
so
is
indeed
a
wicked
bloody
treasure
and
fit
to
bring
a
curse
upon
anybody
who
finds
it
is
more
like
to
bring
a
curse
upon
the
soul
who
buried
it
said
parson
jones
and
it
may
be
a
blessing
to
him
who
finds
it
but
tell
me
tom
do
you
think
you
could
find
the
place
again
where
was
hid
i
ca
tell
that
said
tom
was
all
in
among
the
d
see
and
it
was
at
night
into
the
bargain
maybe
we
could
find
the
marks
of
their
feet
in
the
sand
he
added
is
not
likely
said
the
reverend
gentleman
for
the
storm
last
night
would
have
washed
all
that
away
i
could
find
the
place
said
tom
where
the
boat
was
drawn
up
on
the
beach
why
then
that
something
to
start
from
tom
said
his
friend
if
we
can
find
that
then
maybe
we
can
find
whither
they
went
from
there
if
i
was
certain
it
was
a
cried
out
tom
chist
i
would
rake
over
every
foot
of
sand
betwixt
here
and
henlopen
to
find
it
be
like
hunting
for
a
pin
in
a
haystack
said
the
rev
hilary
jones
as
tom
walked
away
home
it
seemed
as
though
a
ton
weight
of
gloom
had
been
rolled
away
from
his
soul
the
next
day
he
and
parson
jones
were
to
go
together
it
seemed
to
tom
as
though
he
could
hardly
wait
for
the
time
to
come
v
the
next
afternoon
parson
jones
and
tom
chist
started
off
together
upon
the
expedition
that
made
tom
fortune
forever
tom
carried
a
spade
over
his
shoulder
and
the
reverend
gentleman
walked
along
beside
him
with
his
cane
as
they
jogged
along
up
the
beach
they
talked
together
about
the
only
thing
they
could
talk
about
the
and
how
big
did
you
say
quoth
the
good
gentleman
about
so
long
said
tom
chist
measuring
off
upon
the
spade
and
about
so
wide
and
this
deep
and
what
if
it
should
be
full
of
money
tom
said
the
reverend
gentleman
swinging
his
cane
around
and
around
in
wide
circles
in
the
excitement
of
the
thought
as
he
strode
along
briskly
suppose
it
should
be
full
of
money
what
then
by
moses
said
tom
chist
hurrying
to
keep
up
with
his
friend
buy
a
ship
for
myself
i
would
and
i
trade
to
injy
and
to
chiny
to
my
own
boot
i
would
suppose
the
chist
was
all
full
of
money
sir
and
suppose
we
should
find
it
would
there
be
enough
in
it
d
suppose
to
buy
a
ship
to
be
sure
there
would
be
enough
tom
enough
and
to
spare
and
a
good
big
lump
over
and

i
find
it
is
mine
to
keep
is
it
and
no
mistake
why
to
be
sure
it
would
be
yours
cried
out
the
parson
in
a
loud
voice
to
be
sure
it
would
be
yours
he
knew
nothing
of
the
law
but
the
doubt
of
the
question
began
at
once
to
ferment
in
his
brain
and
he
strode
along
in
silence
for
a
while
whose
else
would
it
be
but
yours
if
you
find
it
he
burst
out
can

me
that

best
chist
of
tea
sir
that

fetched
from

chiny
parson
jones
burst
out
laughing
thankee
tom
he
said
and
thankee
again
when
i
get
my
chist
of
tea
but
tell
me
tom
didst
thou
ever
hear
of
the
farmer
girl
who
counted
her
chickens
before
they
were
hatched
it
was
thus
they
talked
as
they
hurried
along
up
the
beach
together
and
so
came
to
a
place
at
last
where
tom
stopped
short
and
stood
looking
about
him
was
just
here
he
said
i
saw
the
boat
last
night
i
know
was
here
for
i
mind
me
of
that
bit
of
wreck
yonder
and
that
there
was
a
tall
stake
drove
in
the
sand
just
where
yon
stake
stands
parson
jones
put
on
his
barnacles
and
went
over
to
the
stake
towards
which
tom
pointed
as
soon
as
he
had
looked
at
it
carefully
he
called
out
why
tom
this
hath
been
just
drove
down
into
the
sand
is
a
stake
of
wood
and
the
pirates
must
have
set
it
here
themselves
as
a
mark
just
as
they
drove
the
pegs
you
spoke
about
down
into
the
sand
tom
came
over
and
looked
at
the
stake
it
was
a
stout
piece
of
oak
nearly
two
inches
thick
it
had
been
shaped
with
some
care
and
the
top
of
it
had
been
painted
red
he
shook
the
stake
and
tried
to
move
it
but
it
had
been
driven
or
planted
so
deeply
into
the
sand
that
he
could
not
stir
it
aye
sir
he
said
it
must
have
been
set
here
for
a
mark
for
i
sure
was
not
here
yesterday
or
the
day
before
he
stood
looking
about
him
to
see
if
there
were
other
signs
of
the
pirates
presence
at
some
little
distance
there
was
the
corner
of
something
white
sticking
up
out
of
the
sand
he
could
see
that
it
was
a
scrap
of
paper
and
he
pointed
to
it
calling
out
yonder
is
a
piece
of
paper
sir
i
wonder
if
they
left
that
behind
them
it
was
a
miraculous
chance
that
placed
that
paper
there
there
was
only
an
inch
of
it
showing
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
tom
sharp
eyes
it
would
certainly
have
been
overlooked
and
passed
by
the
next
would
have
covered
it
up
and
all
that
afterwards
happened
never
would
have
occurred
look
sir
he
said
as
he
struck
the
sand
from
it
it
hath
writing
on
it
let
me
see
it
said
parson
jones
he
adjusted
the
spectacles
a
little
more
firmly
astride
of
his
nose
as
he
took
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
began
conning
it
what
all
this
he
said
a
whole
lot
of
figures
and
nothing
else
and
then
he
read
aloud
by
what
d
suppose
that
means
tom
i
do
know
sir
said
tom
but
maybe
we
can
understand
it
better
if
you
read
on
tis
all
a
great
lot
of
figures
said
parson
jones
without
a
grain
of
meaning
in
them
so
far
as
i
can
see
unless
they
be
sailing
directions
and
then
he
began
reading
again
by
d
see
it
must
be
sailing
directions
what
a
lot
of
them
there
be
peg
by
foot
peg
by
foot
peg
dig
to
the
west
of
this
six
foot
what
that
about
a
peg
exclaimed
tom
what
that
about
a
peg
and
then
there
something
about
digging
too
it
was
as
though
a
sudden
light
began
shining
into
his
brain
he
felt
himself
growing
quickly
very
excited
read
that
over
again
sir
he
cried
why
sir
you
remember
i
told
you
they
drove
a
peg
into
the
sand
and
do
they
say
to
dig
close
to
it
read
it
over
again
sir
read
it
over
again
peg
said
the
good
gentleman
to
be
sure
it
was
about
a
peg
look
again
yes
here
it
is
by
foot
aye
cried
out
tom
chist
again
in
great
excitement
do
you
remember
what
i
told
you
sir
foot
sure
that
must
be
what
i
saw
measuring
with
the
line
parson
jones
had
now
caught
the
flame
of
excitement
that
was
blazing
up
so
strongly
in
tom
breast
he
felt
as
though
some
wonderful
thing
was
about
to
happen
to
them
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
he
called
out
in
a
great
big
voice
and
then
they
measured
out
foot
by
south
and
then
they
drove
another
peg
and
then
they
buried
the
box
six
foot
to
the
west
of
it
why
tom
why
tom
chist
if
we
read
this
aright
thy
fortune
is
made
tom
chist
stood
staring
straight
at
the
old
gentleman
excited
face
and
seeing
nothing
but
it
in
all
the
bright
infinity
of
sunshine
were
they
indeed
about
to
find
the
he
felt
the
sun
very
hot
upon
his
shoulders
and
he
heard
the
harsh
insistent
jarring
of
a
tern
that
hovered
and
circled
with
forked
tail
and
sharp
white
wings
in
the
sunlight
just
above
their
heads
but
all
the
time
he
stood
staring
into
the
good
old
gentleman
face
it
was
parson
jones
who
first
spoke
but
what
do
all
these
figures
mean
and
tom
observed
how
the
paper
shook
and
rustled
in
the
tremor
of
excitement
that
shook
his
hand
he
raised
the
paper
to
the
focus
of
his
spectacles
and
began
to
read
again
mark
cried
out
tom
almost
screaming
why
that
must
mean
the
stake
yonder
that
must
be
the
mark
and
he
pointed
to
the
oaken
stick
with
its
red
tip
blazing
against
the
white
shimmer
of
sand
behind
it
and
the
and
and
cried
the
old
gentleman
in
a
voice
equally
shrill
why
that
must
mean
the
number
of
steps
the
pirate
was
counting
when
you
heard
him
to
be
sure
that
what
they
mean
cried
tom
chist
that
is
it
and
it
can
be
nothing
else
oh
come
sir
come
sir
let
us
make
haste
and
find
it
stay
stay
said
the
good
gentleman
holding
up
his
hand
and
again
tom
chist
noticed
how
it
trembled
and
shook
his
voice
was
steady
enough
though
very
hoarse
but
his
hand
shook
and
trembled
as
though
with
a
palsy
stay
stay
first
of
all
we
must
follow
these
measurements
and
is
a
marvellous
thing
he
croaked
after
a
little
pause
how
this
paper
ever
came
to
be
here
maybe
it
was
blown
here
by
the
storm
suggested
tom
chist
like
enough
like
enough
said
parson
jones
like
enough
after
the
wretches
had
buried
the
chest
and
killed
the
poor
black
man
they
were
so
buffeted
and
bowsed
about
by
the
storm
that
it
was
shook
out
of
the
man
pocket
and
thus
blew
away
from
him
without
his
knowing
aught
of
it
but
let
us
find
the
box
cried
out
tom
chist
flaming
with
his
excitement
aye
aye
said
the
good
man
only
stay
a
little
my
boy
until
we
make
sure
what
we
about
i
got
my
here
but
we
must
have
something
to
measure
off
the
feet
when
we
have
found
the
peg
you
run
across
to
tom
brooke
house
and
fetch
that
he
used
to
lay
out
his
new
byre
while
you
gone
i
pace
off
the
distance
marked
on
the
paper
with
my
here
vi
tom
chist
was
gone
for
almost
an
hour
though
he
ran
nearly
all
the
way
and
back
upborne
as
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
when
he
returned
panting
parson
jones
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
tom
saw
his
footsteps
leading
away
inland
and
he
followed
the
scuffling
marks
in
the
smooth
surface
across
the
and
down
into
the
hollows
and
found
the
good
gentleman
in
a
spot
he
at
once
knew
as
soon
as
he
laid
his
eyes
upon
it
it
was
the
open
space
where
the
pirates
had
driven
their
first
peg
and
where
tom
chist
had
afterwards
seen
them
kill
the
poor
black
man
tom
chist
gazed
around
as
though
expecting
to
see
some
sign
of
the
tragedy
but
the
space
was
as
smooth
and
as
undisturbed
as
a
floor
excepting
where
midway
across
it
parson
jones
who
was
now
stooping
over
something
on
the
ground
had
trampled
it
all
around
about
when
tom
chist
saw
him
he
was
still
bending
over
scraping
the
sand
away
from
something
he
had
found
it
was
the
first
peg
inside
of
half
an
hour
they
had
found
the
second
and
third
pegs
and
tom
chist
stripped
off
his
coat
and
began
digging
like
mad
down
into
the
sand
parson
jones
standing
over
him
watching
him
the
sun
was
sloping
well
towards
the
west
when
the
blade
of
tom
chist
spade
struck
upon
something
hard
if
it
had
been
his
own
heart
that
he
had
hit
in
the
sand
his
breast
could
hardly
have
thrilled
more
sharply
it
was
the
parson
jones
himself
leaped
down
into
the
hole
and
began
scraping
away
the
sand
with
his
hands
as
though
he
had
gone
crazy
at
last
with
some
difficulty
they
tugged
and
hauled
the
chest
up
out
of
the
sand
to
the
surface
where
it
lay
covered
all
over
with
the
grit
that
clung
to
it
it
was
securely
locked
and
fastened
with
a
padlock
and
it
took
a
good
many
blows
with
the
blade
of
the
spade
to
burst
the
bolt
parson
jones
himself
lifted
the
lid
tom
chist
leaned
forward
and
gazed
down
into
the
open
box
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
have
seen
it
filled
full
of
yellow
gold
and
bright
jewels
it
was
filled
half
full
of
books
and
papers
and
half
full
of
canvas
bags
tied
safely
and
securely
around
and
around
with
cords
of
string
parson
jones
lifted
out
one
of
the
bags
and
it
jingled
as
he
did
so
it
was
full
of
money
he
cut
the
string
and
with
trembling
shaking
hands
handed
the
bag
to
tom
who
in
an
ecstasy
of
wonder
and
dizzy
with
delight
poured
out
with
swimming
sight
upon
the
coat
spread
on
the
ground
a
cataract
of
shining
silver
money
that
rang
and
twinkled
and
jingled
as
it
fell
in
a
shining
heap
upon
the
coarse
cloth
parson
jones
held
up
both
hands
into
the
air
and
tom
stared
at
what
he
saw
wondering
whether
it
was
all
so
and
whether
he
was
really
awake
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
was
in
a
dream
there
were
bags
in
all
in
the
chest
ten
of
them
full
of
silver
money
eight
of
them
full
of
gold
money
three
of
them
full
of
and
one
small
bag
with
jewels
wrapped
up
in
wad
cotton
and
paper
illustration
is
enough
cried
out
parson
jones
make
us
both
rich
men
is
enough
cried
out
parson
jones
to
make
us
both
rich
men
as
long
as
we
live
the
burning
summer
sun
though
sloping
in
the
sky
beat
down
upon
them
as
hot
as
fire
but
neither
of
them
noticed
it
neither
did
they
notice
hunger
nor
thirst
nor
fatigue
but
sat
there
as
though
in
a
trance
with
the
bags
of
money
scattered
on
the
sand
around
them
a
great
pile
of
money
heaped
upon
the
coat
and
the
open
chest
beside
them
it
was
an
hour
of
sundown
before
parson
jones
had
begun
fairly
to
examine
the
books
and
papers
in
the
chest
of
the
three
books
two
were
evidently
of
the
pirates
who
had
been
lying
off
the
mouth
of
the
delaware
bay
all
this
time
the
other
book
was
written
in
spanish
and
was
evidently
the
of
some
captured
prize
it
was
then
sitting
there
upon
the
sand
the
good
old
gentleman
reading
in
his
high
cracking
voice
that
they
first
learned
from
the
bloody
records
in
those
two
books
who
it
was
who
had
been
lying
inside
the
cape
all
this
time
and
that
it
was
the
famous
captain
kidd
every
now
and
then
the
reverend
gentleman
would
stop
to
exclaim
oh
the
bloody
wretch
or
oh
the
desperate
cruel
villains
and
then
would
go
on
reading
again
a
scrap
here
and
a
scrap
there
and
all
the
while
tom
chist
sat
and
listened
every
now
and
then
reaching
out
furtively
and
touching
the
heap
of
money
still
lying
upon
the
coat
one
might
be
inclined
to
wonder
why
captain
kidd
had
kept
those
bloody
records
he
had
probably
laid
them
away
because
they
so
incriminated
many
of
the
great
people
of
the
colony
of
new
york
that
with
the
books
in
evidence
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
bring
the
pirate
to
justice
without
dragging
a
dozen
or
more
fine
gentlemen
into
the
dock
along
with
him
if
he
could
have
kept
them
in
his
own
possession
they
would
doubtless
have
been
a
great
weapon
of
defence
to
protect
him
from
the
gallows
indeed
when
captain
kidd
was
finally
brought
to
conviction
and
hung
he
was
not
accused
of
his
piracies
but
of
striking
a
mutinous
seaman
upon
the
head
with
a
bucket
and
accidentally
killing
him
the
authorities
did
not
dare
try
him
for
piracy
he
was
really
hung
because
he
was
a
pirate
and
we
know
that
it
was
the
that
tom
chist
brought
to
new
york
that
did
the
business
for
him
he
was
accused
and
convicted
of
manslaughter
for
killing
of
his
own
with
a
bucket
so
parson
jones
sitting
there
in
the
slanting
light
read
through
these
terrible
records
of
piracy
and
tom
with
the
pile
of
gold
and
silver
money
beside
him
sat
and
listened
to
him
what
a
spectacle
if
any
one
had
come
upon
them
but
they
were
alone
with
the
vast
arch
of
sky
empty
above
them
and
the
wide
white
stretch
of
sand
a
desert
around
them
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
until
there
was
only
time
to
glance
through
the
other
papers
in
the
chest
they
were
nearly
all
goldsmiths
bills
of
exchange
drawn
in
favor
of
certain
of
the
most
prominent
merchants
of
new
york
parson
jones
as
he
read
over
the
names
knew
of
nearly
all
the
gentlemen
by
hearsay
aye
here
was
this
gentleman
he
thought
that
name
would
be
among
what
here
is
well
if
all
they
say
is
true
the
villain
has
robbed
one
of
his
own
best
friends
i
wonder
he
said
why
the
wretch
should
have
hidden
these
papers
so
carefully
away
with
the
other
treasures
for
they
could
do
him
no
good
then
answering
his
own
question
like
enough
because
these
will
give
him
a
hold
over
the
gentlemen
to
whom
they
are
drawn
so
that
he
can
make
a
good
bargain
for
his
own
neck
before
he
gives
the
bills
back
to
their
owners
i
tell
you
what
it
is
tom
he
continued
it
is
you
yourself
shall
go
to
new
york
and
bargain
for
the
return
of
these
papers
be
as
good
as
another
fortune
to
you
the
majority
of
the
bills
were
drawn
in
favor
of
one
richard
chillingsworth
esquire
and
he
is
said
parson
jones
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
province
of
new
york
you
shall
go
to
him
with
the
news
of
what
we
have
found
when
shall
i
go
said
tom
chist
you
shall
go
upon
the
very
first
boat
we
can
catch
said
the
parson
he
had
turned
still
holding
the
bills
in
his
hand
and
was
now
fingering
over
the
pile
of
money
that
yet
lay
tumbled
out
upon
the
coat
i
wonder
tom
said
he
if
you
could
spare
me
a
score
or
so
of
these
doubloons
you
shall
have
fifty
score
if
you
choose
said
tom
bursting
with
gratitude
and
with
generosity
in
his
newly
found
treasure
you
are
as
fine
a
lad
as
ever
i
saw
tom
said
the
parson
and
thank
you
to
the
last
day
of
my
life
tom
scooped
up
a
double
handful
of
silver
money
take
it
sir
he
said
and
you
may
have
as
much
more
as
you
want
of
it
he
poured
it
into
the
dish
that
the
good
man
made
of
his
hands
and
the
parson
made
a
motion
as
though
to
empty
it
into
his
pocket
then
he
stopped
as
though
a
sudden
doubt
had
occurred
to
him
i
do
know
that
is
fit
for
me
to
take
this
pirate
money
after
all
he
said
but
you
are
welcome
to
it
said
tom
still
the
parson
hesitated
nay
he
burst
out
i
not
take
it
and
as
he
spoke
he
chucked
the
whole
double
handful
into
the
now
empty
chest
then
arose
and
dusted
the
sand
from
his
breeches
then
with
a
great
deal
of
bustling
energy
he
helped
to
tie
the
bags
again
and
put
them
all
back
into
the
chest
they
reburied
the
chest
in
the
place
whence
they
had
taken
it
and
then
the
parson
folded
the
precious
paper
of
directions
placed
it
carefully
in
his
wallet
and
his
wallet
in
his
pocket
tom
he
said
for
the
twentieth
time
your
fortune
has
been
made
this
day
and
tom
chist
as
he
rattled
in
his
breeches
pocket
the
doubloons
he
had
kept
out
of
his
treasure
felt
that
what
his
friend
had
said
was
true
as
the
two
went
back
homeward
across
the
level
space
of
sand
tom
chist
suddenly
stopped
stock
still
and
stood
looking
about
him
was
just
here
he
said
digging
his
heel
down
into
the
sand
that
they
killed
the
poor
black
man
and
here
he
lies
buried
for
all
time
said
parson
jones
and
as
he
spoke
he
dug
his
cane
down
into
the
sand
tom
chist
shuddered
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
the
ferrule
of
the
cane
had
struck
something
soft
beneath
that
level
surface
but
it
did
not
nor
was
any
sign
of
that
tragedy
ever
seen
again
for
whether
the
pirates
had
carried
away
what
they
had
done
and
buried
it
elsewhere
or
whether
the
storm
in
blowing
the
sand
had
completely
levelled
off
and
hidden
all
sign
of
that
tragedy
where
it
was
enacted
certain
it
is
that
it
never
came
to
sight
again
at
least
so
far
as
tom
chist
and
the
reverend
hillary
jones
ever
knew
vii
this
is
the
story
of
the
all
that
remains
now
is
to
conclude
the
story
of
tom
chist
and
to
tell
of
what
came
of
him
in
the
end
he
did
not
go
back
again
to
live
with
old
matt
abrahamson
parson
jones
had
now
taken
charge
of
him
and
his
fortunes
and
tom
did
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
fisherman
hut
old
abrahamson
talked
a
great
deal
about
it
and
would
come
in
his
cups
and
harangue
good
parson
jones
making
a
vast
protestation
of
what
he
would
do
to
tom
if
he
ever
caught
him
for
running
away
but
tom
on
all
these
occasions
kept
carefully
out
of
his
way
and
nothing
came
of
the
old
man
threatenings
tom
used
to
go
over
to
see
his
now
and
then
but
always
when
the
old
man
was
from
home
and
molly
abrahamson
used
to
warn
him
to
keep
out
of
her
father
way
he
in
as
vile
a
humor
as
ever
i
see
tom
she
said
he
sits
sulking
all
day
long
and
is
my
belief
he
kill
ye
if
he
caught
ye
of
course
tom
said
nothing
even
to
her
about
the
treasure
and
he
and
the
reverend
gentleman
kept
the
knowledge
thereof
to
themselves
about
three
weeks
later
parson
jones
managed
to
get
him
shipped
aboard
of
a
vessel
bound
for
new
york
town
and
a
few
days
later
tom
chist
landed
at
that
place
he
had
never
been
in
such
a
town
before
and
he
could
not
sufficiently
wonder
and
marvel
at
the
number
of
brick
houses
at
the
multitude
of
people
coming
and
going
along
the
fine
hard
earthen
sidewalk
at
the
shops
and
the
stores
where
goods
hung
in
the
windows
and
most
of
all
the
fortifications
and
the
battery
at
the
point
at
the
rows
of
threatening
cannon
and
at
the
sentries
pacing
up
and
down
the
ramparts
all
this
was
very
wonderful
and
so
were
the
clustered
boats
riding
at
anchor
in
the
harbor
it
was
like
a
new
world
so
different
was
it
from
the
and
the
sedgy
levels
of
henlopen
tom
chist
took
up
his
lodgings
at
a
coffeehouse
near
to
the
and
thence
he
sent
by
the
a
letter
written
by
parson
jones
to
master
chillingsworth
in
a
little
while
the
boy
returned
with
a
message
asking
tom
to
come
up
to
chillingsworth
house
that
afternoon
at
two
tom
went
thither
with
a
great
deal
of
trepidation
and
his
heart
fell
away
altogether
when
he
found
it
a
fine
grand
brick
house
three
stories
high
and
with
letters
across
the
front
the
was
in
the
same
building
but
tom
because
of
jones
letter
was
conducted
directly
into
the
parlor
where
the
great
rich
man
was
awaiting
his
coming
he
was
sitting
in
a
smoking
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
with
a
bottle
of
fine
old
madeira
close
to
his
elbow
tom
had
not
had
a
chance
to
buy
a
new
suit
of
clothes
yet
and
so
he
cut
no
very
fine
figure
in
the
rough
dress
he
had
brought
with
him
from
henlopen
nor
did
chillingsworth
seem
to
think
very
highly
of
his
appearance
for
he
sat
looking
sideways
at
tom
as
he
smoked
well
my
lad
he
said
and
what
is
this
great
thing
you
have
to
tell
me
that
is
so
mightily
wonderful
i
got
jones
letter
and
now
i
am
ready
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
but
if
he
thought
but
little
of
his
visitor
appearance
at
first
he
soon
changed
his
sentiments
towards
him
for
tom
had
not
spoken
twenty
words
when
chillingsworth
whole
aspect
changed
he
straightened
himself
up
in
his
seat
laid
aside
his
pipe
pushed
away
his
glass
of
madeira
and
bade
tom
take
a
chair
he
listened
without
a
word
as
tom
chist
told
of
the
buried
treasure
of
how
he
had
seen
the
poor
negro
murdered
and
of
how
he
and
parson
jones
had
recovered
the
chest
again
only
once
did
chillingsworth
interrupt
the
narrative
and
to
think
he
cried
that
the
villain
this
very
day
walks
about
new
york
town
as
though
he
were
an
honest
man
ruffling
it
with
the
best
of
us
but
if
we
can
only
get
hold
of
these
you
speak
of
go
on
tell
me
more
of
this
when
tom
chist
narrative
was
ended
chillingsworth
bearing
was
as
different
as
daylight
is
from
dark
he
asked
a
thousand
questions
all
in
the
most
polite
and
gracious
tone
imaginable
and
not
only
urged
a
glass
of
his
fine
old
madeira
upon
tom
but
asked
him
to
stay
to
supper
there
was
nobody
to
be
there
he
said
but
his
wife
and
daughter
tom
all
in
a
panic
at
the
very
thought
of
the
two
ladies
sturdily
refused
to
stay
even
for
the
dish
of
tea
chillingsworth
offered
him
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
destined
to
stay
there
as
long
as
he
should
live
and
now
said
chillingsworth
tell
me
about
yourself
i
have
nothing
to
tell
your
honor
said
tom
except
that
i
was
washed
up
out
of
the
sea
washed
up
out
of
the
sea
exclaimed
chillingsworth
why
how
was
that
come
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
all
thereupon
tom
chist
did
as
he
was
bidden
beginning
at
the
very
beginning
and
telling
everything
just
as
molly
abrahamson
had
often
told
it
to
him
as
he
continued
chillingsworth
interest
changed
into
an
appearance
of
stronger
and
stronger
excitement
suddenly
he
jumped
up
out
of
his
chair
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
stop
stop
he
cried
out
at
last
in
the
midst
of
something
tom
was
saying
stop
stop
tell
me
do
you
know
the
name
of
the
vessel
that
was
wrecked
and
from
which
you
were
washed
ashore
i
heard
it
said
said
tom
chist
was
the
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
exclaimed
the
great
man
in
a
loud
voice
flinging
his
hands
up
into
the
air
i
felt
it
was
so
the
moment
you
began
the
story
but
tell
me
this
was
there
nothing
found
with
you
with
a
mark
or
a
name
upon
it
there
was
a
kerchief
said
tom
marked
with
a
t
and
a
theodosia
chillingsworth
cried
out
the
merchant
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
heavens
to
think
of
anything
so
wonderful
happening
as
this
boy
boy
dost
thou
know
who
thou
art
thou
art
my
own
brother
son
his
name
was
oliver
chillingsworth
and
he
was
my
partner
in
business
and
thou
art
his
son
then
he
ran
out
into
the
entryway
shouting
and
calling
for
his
wife
and
daughter
to
come
so
tom
chist
or
thomas
chillingsworth
as
he
now
was
to
be
called
did
stay
to
supper
after
all
this
is
the
story
and
i
hope
you
may
like
it
for
tom
chist
became
rich
and
great
as
was
to
be
supposed
and
he
married
his
pretty
cousin
theodosia
who
had
been
named
for
his
own
mother
drowned
in
the
he
did
not
forget
his
friends
but
had
parson
jones
brought
to
new
york
to
live
as
to
molly
and
matt
abrahamson
they
both
enjoyed
a
pension
of
ten
pounds
a
year
for
as
long
as
they
lived
for
now
that
all
was
well
with
him
tom
bore
no
grudge
against
the
old
fisherman
for
all
the
drubbings
he
had
suffered
the
was
brought
on
to
new
york
and
if
tom
chist
did
not
get
all
the
money
there
was
in
it
as
parson
jones
had
opined
he
would
he
got
at
least
a
good
big
lump
of
it
and
it
is
my
belief
that
those
did
more
to
get
captain
kidd
arrested
in
boston
town
and
hanged
in
london
than
anything
else
that
was
brought
up
against
him
iii
the
ghost
of
captain
brand
a
narrative
of
certain
extraordinary
adventures
that
befell
barnaby
true
esquire
of
the
town
of
new
york
in
the
year
i
it
is
not
so
easy
to
tell
why
discredit
should
be
cast
upon
a
man
because
of
something
his
grandfather
may
have
done
amiss
but
the
world
which
is
never
in
its
discrimination
as
to
where
to
lay
the
blame
is
often
pleased
to
make
the
innocent
suffer
instead
of
the
guilty
barnaby
true
was
a
good
honest
boy
as
boys
go
but
yet
was
he
not
ever
allowed
altogether
to
forget
that
his
grandfather
had
been
that
very
famous
pirate
captain
william
brand
who
after
so
many
marvellous
adventures
if
one
may
believe
the
catchpenny
stories
and
ballads
that
were
writ
about
him
was
murdered
in
jamaica
by
captain
john
malyoe
the
commander
of
his
own
consort
the
galley
it
hath
never
been
denied
that
ever
i
heard
that
up
to
the
time
of
captain
brand
being
commissioned
against
the
south
sea
pirates
he
had
always
been
esteemed
as
honest
reputable
a
as
could
be
when
he
started
out
upon
that
adventure
it
was
with
a
ship
the
fitted
out
by
some
of
the
most
decent
merchants
of
new
york
governor
van
dam
himself
had
subscribed
to
the
adventure
and
himself
had
signed
captain
brand
commission
so
if
the
unfortunate
man
went
astray
he
must
have
had
great
temptation
to
do
so
many
others
behaving
no
better
when
the
opportunity
offered
in
these
seas
when
so
many
rich
purchases
might
very
easily
be
taken
and
no
one
the
wiser
to
be
sure
those
stories
and
ballads
made
our
captain
to
be
a
most
wicked
profane
wretch
and
if
he
were
why
god
knows
he
suffered
and
paid
for
it
for
he
laid
his
bones
in
jamaica
and
never
saw
his
home
or
his
wife
or
his
daughter
after
he
had
sailed
away
on
the
on
that
long
misfortunate
voyage
leaving
his
family
behind
him
in
new
york
to
the
care
of
strangers
at
the
time
when
captain
brand
so
met
his
fate
in
port
royal
harbor
he
had
increased
his
flotilla
to
two
vessels
the
which
was
the
vessel
that
had
been
fitted
out
for
him
in
new
york
a
fine
brigantine
and
a
good
sailer
and
the
galley
which
he
had
captured
somewhere
in
the
south
seas
this
latter
vessel
he
placed
in
command
of
a
certain
john
malyoe
whom
he
had
picked
up
no
one
knows
where
a
young
man
of
very
good
family
in
england
who
had
turned
pirate
this
man
who
took
no
more
thought
of
a
human
life
than
he
would
of
a
broom
straw
was
he
who
afterwards
murdered
captain
brand
as
you
shall
presently
hear
with
these
two
vessels
the
and
the
captain
brand
and
captain
malyoe
swept
the
mozambique
channel
as
clear
as
a
boatswain
whistle
and
after
three
years
of
piracy
having
gained
a
great
booty
of
gold
and
silver
and
pearls
sailed
straight
for
the
americas
making
first
the
island
of
jamaica
and
the
harbor
of
port
royal
where
they
dropped
anchor
to
wait
for
news
from
home
but
by
this
time
the
authorities
had
been
so
stirred
up
against
our
pirates
that
it
became
necessary
for
them
to
hide
their
booty
until
such
time
as
they
might
make
their
peace
with
the
admiralty
courts
at
home
so
one
night
captain
brand
and
captain
malyoe
with
two
others
of
the
pirates
went
ashore
with
two
great
chests
of
treasure
which
they
buried
somewhere
on
the
banks
of
the
cobra
river
near
the
place
where
the
old
spanish
fort
had
stood
what
happened
after
the
treasure
was
thus
buried
no
one
may
tell
was
said
that
captain
brand
and
captain
malyoe
fell
and
that
the
upshot
of
the
matter
was
that
captain
malyoe
shot
captain
brand
through
the
head
and
that
the
pirate
who
was
with
him
served
captain
brand
companion
after
the
same
fashion
with
a
pistol
bullet
through
the
body
after
that
the
two
murderers
returned
to
their
vessel
the
galley
and
sailed
away
carrying
the
bloody
secret
of
the
buried
treasure
with
them
illustration
captain
malyoe
shot
captain
brand
through
the
head
but
this
double
murder
of
captain
brand
and
his
companion
happened
you
are
to
understand
some
twenty
years
before
the
time
of
this
story
and
while
our
hero
was
but
one
year
old
so
now
to
our
present
history
it
is
a
great
pity
that
any
one
should
have
a
grandfather
who
ended
his
days
in
such
a
sort
as
this
but
it
was
no
fault
of
barnaby
true
nor
could
he
have
done
anything
to
prevent
it
seeing
he
was
not
even
born
into
the
world
at
the
time
that
his
grandfather
turned
pirate
and
that
he
was
only
one
year
old
when
captain
brand
so
met
his
death
on
the
cobra
river
nevertheless
the
boys
with
whom
he
went
to
school
never
tired
of
calling
him
pirate
and
would
sometimes
sing
for
his
benefit
that
famous
catchpenny
ballad
beginning
thus
oh
my
name
was
captain
brand
and
oh
my
name
was
captain
brand
free
oh
my
name
was
captain
brand
and
i
sinned
by
sea
and
land
for
i
broke
god
just
command
free
was
a
vile
thing
to
sing
at
the
grandson
of
so
unfortunate
a
man
and
oftentimes
barnaby
true
would
double
up
his
little
fists
and
would
fight
his
tormentors
at
great
odds
and
would
sometimes
go
back
home
with
a
bloody
nose
or
a
bruised
eye
to
have
his
poor
mother
cry
over
him
and
grieve
for
him
not
that
his
days
were
all
of
teasing
and
torment
either
for
if
his
comrades
did
sometimes
treat
him
so
why
then
there
were
other
times
when
he
and
they
were
as
great
friends
as
could
be
and
used
to
go
together
in
the
most
amicable
fashion
where
there
was
a
bit
of
sandy
strand
below
the
little
bluff
along
the
east
river
above
fort
george
there
was
a
clump
of
wide
at
that
place
with
a
fine
shade
and
a
place
to
lay
their
clothes
while
they
swam
about
splashing
with
their
naked
white
bodies
in
the
water
at
these
times
master
barnaby
would
bawl
as
lustily
and
laugh
as
loud
as
though
his
grandfather
had
been
the
most
honest
in
the
town
instead
of
a
pirate
who
had
been
murdered
in
his
sins
ah
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
look
back
to
the
days
when
one
was
a
boy
barnaby
may
remember
how
often
when
he
and
his
companions
were
paddling
so
in
the
water
the
soldiers
off
duty
would
come
up
from
the
fort
and
would
maybe
join
them
in
the
water
others
perhaps
standing
in
their
red
coats
on
the
shore
looking
on
and
smoking
their
pipes
of
tobacco
then
there
were
other
times
when
maybe
the
very
next
day
after
our
hero
had
fought
with
great
valor
with
his
fellows
he
would
go
with
them
up
the
bouwerie
road
with
the
utmost
friendliness
perhaps
to
help
them
steal
cherries
from
some
old
dutch
farmer
forgetting
in
such
an
adventure
what
a
thief
his
own
grandfather
had
been
but
to
resume
our
story
when
barnaby
true
was
between
sixteen
and
seventeen
years
old
he
was
taken
into
employment
in
the
of
his
stepfather
roger
hartright
the
west
indian
merchant
a
most
respectable
man
and
one
of
the
kindest
and
best
of
friends
that
anybody
could
have
in
the
world
this
good
gentleman
had
courted
the
favor
of
barnaby
mother
for
a
long
time
before
he
had
married
her
indeed
he
had
so
courted
her
before
she
had
ever
thought
of
marrying
jonathan
true
but
he
not
venturing
to
ask
her
in
marriage
and
she
being
a
brisk
handsome
woman
she
chose
the
man
who
spoke
out
his
mind
and
so
left
the
silent
lover
out
in
the
cold
but
so
soon
as
she
was
a
widow
and
free
again
hartright
resumed
his
wooing
and
so
used
to
come
down
every
tuesday
and
friday
evening
to
sit
and
talk
with
her
among
barnaby
true
earliest
memories
was
a
recollection
of
the
good
kind
gentleman
sitting
in
old
captain
brand
the
sunlight
shining
across
his
knees
over
which
he
had
spread
a
great
red
silk
handkerchief
while
he
sipped
a
dish
of
tea
with
a
dash
of
rum
in
it
he
kept
up
this
habit
of
visiting
the
widow
true
for
a
long
time
before
he
could
fetch
himself
to
the
point
of
asking
anything
more
particular
of
her
and
so
barnaby
was
nigh
fourteen
years
old
before
hartright
married
her
and
so
became
our
hero
dear
and
honored
it
was
the
kindness
of
this
good
man
that
not
only
found
a
place
for
barnaby
in
the
but
advanced
him
so
fast
that
against
our
hero
was
years
old
he
had
made
four
voyages
as
supercargo
to
the
west
indies
in
hartright
ship
the
and
soon
after
he
was
undertook
a
fifth
nor
was
it
in
any
such
subordinate
position
as
mere
supercargo
that
he
sailed
upon
these
adventures
but
rather
as
the
confidential
agent
of
hartright
who
having
no
likelihood
of
children
of
his
own
was
jealous
to
advance
our
hero
to
a
position
of
trust
and
responsibility
in
the
and
so
would
have
him
know
all
the
particulars
of
the
business
and
become
more
intimately
acquainted
with
the
correspondents
and
agents
throughout
those
parts
of
the
west
indies
where
the
affairs
of
the
house
were
most
active
he
would
give
to
barnaby
the
best
sort
of
letters
of
introduction
so
that
the
correspondents
of
hartright
throughout
those
parts
seeing
how
that
gentleman
had
adopted
our
hero
interests
as
his
own
were
always
at
considerable
pains
to
be
very
polite
and
obliging
in
showing
every
attention
to
him
especially
among
these
gentlemen
throughout
the
west
indies
may
be
mentioned
ambrose
greenfield
a
merchant
of
excellent
standing
who
lived
at
kingston
jamaica
this
gentleman
was
very
particular
to
do
all
that
he
could
to
make
our
hero
stay
in
these
parts
as
agreeable
and
pleasant
to
him
as
might
be
greenfield
is
here
spoken
of
with
a
greater
degree
of
particularity
than
others
who
might
as
well
be
remarked
upon
because
as
the
reader
shall
presently
discover
for
himself
it
was
through
the
offices
of
this
good
friend
that
our
hero
first
became
acquainted
not
only
with
that
lady
who
afterwards
figured
with
such
conspicuousness
in
his
affairs
but
also
with
a
man
who
though
graced
with
a
title
was
perhaps
the
greatest
villain
who
ever
escaped
a
just
fate
upon
the
gallows
so
much
for
the
history
of
barnaby
true
up
to
the
beginning
of
this
story
without
which
you
shall
hardly
be
able
to
understand
the
purport
of
those
most
extraordinary
adventures
that
afterwards
befell
him
nor
the
logic
of
their
consequence
after
they
had
occurred
ii
upon
the
occasion
of
our
hero
fifth
voyage
into
the
west
indies
he
made
a
stay
of
some
six
or
eight
weeks
at
kingston
in
the
island
of
jamaica
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
first
of
those
extraordinary
adventures
befell
him
concerning
which
this
narrative
has
to
relate
it
was
barnaby
habit
when
staying
at
kingston
to
take
lodging
with
a
very
decent
respectable
widow
by
name
anne
bolles
who
with
three
extremely
agreeable
and
pleasant
daughters
kept
a
very
clean
and
house
for
the
accommodation
of
strangers
visiting
that
island
one
morning
as
he
sat
sipping
his
coffee
clad
only
in
loose
cotton
drawers
and
a
jacket
of
the
same
material
and
with
slippers
upon
his
feet
as
is
the
custom
in
that
country
where
every
one
endeavors
to
keep
as
cool
as
may
be
miss
eliza
the
youngest
of
the
three
daughters
a
brisk
handsome
miss
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
came
tripping
into
the
room
and
handed
him
a
sealed
letter
which
she
declared
a
stranger
had
just
left
at
the
door
departing
incontinently
so
soon
as
he
had
eased
himself
of
that
commission
you
may
conceive
of
barnaby
astonishment
when
he
opened
the
note
and
read
the
remarkable
words
that
here
follow
barnaby
sir
though
you
do
know
me
i
know
you
and
i
tell
you
this
if
you
will
be
at
pratt
ordinary
on
friday
next
at
eight
in
the
evening
and
will
accompany
the
man
who
shall
say
to
you
royal
sovereign
is
come
you
shall
learn
of
something
the
most
to
your
advantage
that
ever
befell
you
sir
keep
this
note
and
give
it
to
him
who
shall
address
those
words
to
you
so
to
certify
that
you
are
the
man
he
seeks
sir
this
is
the
most
important
thing
that
can
concern
you
so
you
will
please
say
nothing
to
nobody
about
it
such
was
the
wording
of
the
note
which
was
writ
in
as
cramped
and
villanous
handwriting
as
our
hero
ever
beheld
and
which
excepting
his
own
name
was
without
address
and
which
possessed
no
superscription
whatever
the
first
emotion
that
stirred
barnaby
true
was
one
of
extreme
and
profound
astonishment
the
second
thought
that
came
into
his
mind
was
that
maybe
some
witty
fellow
of
whom
he
knew
a
good
many
in
that
place
and
wild
mad
rakes
they
were
as
ever
the
world
beheld
was
attempting
to
play
off
a
smart
witty
jest
upon
him
indeed
miss
eliza
bolles
who
was
of
a
lively
mischievous
temper
was
not
herself
above
playing
such
a
prank
should
the
occasion
offer
with
this
thought
in
his
mind
barnaby
inquired
of
her
with
a
good
deal
of
particularity
concerning
the
appearance
and
condition
of
the
man
who
had
left
the
note
to
all
of
which
miss
replied
with
so
straight
a
face
and
so
candid
an
air
that
he
could
no
longer
suspect
her
of
being
concerned
in
any
trick
against
him
and
so
eased
his
mind
of
any
such
suspicion
the
bearer
of
the
note
she
informed
him
was
a
tall
lean
man
with
a
red
neckerchief
tied
around
his
neck
and
with
copper
buckles
to
his
shoes
and
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
having
a
great
queue
of
red
hair
hanging
down
his
back
but
lord
what
was
such
a
description
as
that
in
a
busy
seaport
town
full
of
scores
of
men
to
fit
such
a
likeness
accordingly
our
hero
put
the
note
away
into
his
wallet
determining
to
show
it
to
his
good
friend
greenfield
that
evening
and
to
ask
his
advice
upon
it
this
he
did
and
that
gentleman
opinion
was
the
same
as
his
to
wit
that
some
wag
was
minded
to
play
off
a
hoax
upon
him
and
that
the
matter
of
the
letter
was
all
nothing
but
smoke
iii
nevertheless
though
barnaby
was
thus
confirmed
in
his
opinion
as
to
the
nature
of
the
communication
he
had
received
he
yet
determined
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
see
the
business
through
to
the
end
and
so
be
at
pratt
ordinary
as
the
note
demanded
upon
the
day
and
at
the
time
appointed
therein
pratt
ordinary
was
at
that
time
a
very
fine
and
famous
place
of
its
sort
with
good
tobacco
and
the
best
rum
in
the
west
indies
and
had
a
garden
behind
it
that
sloping
down
to
the
harbor
front
was
planted
pretty
thick
with
palms
and
ferns
grouped
into
clusters
with
flowers
and
plants
here
were
a
number
of
tables
some
in
little
grottos
like
our
vauxhall
in
new
york
with
red
and
blue
and
white
paper
lanterns
hung
among
the
foliage
thither
gentlemen
and
ladies
used
sometimes
to
go
of
an
evening
to
sit
and
drink
and
sugar
and
water
and
sometimes
a
taste
of
something
stronger
and
to
look
out
across
the
water
at
the
shipping
and
so
to
enjoy
the
cool
of
the
day
thither
accordingly
our
hero
went
a
little
before
the
time
appointed
in
the
note
and
passing
directly
through
the
ordinary
and
to
the
garden
beyond
chose
a
table
at
the
lower
end
and
close
to
the
edge
where
he
could
not
readily
be
seen
by
any
one
coming
into
the
place
and
yet
where
he
could
easily
view
whoever
should
approach
then
ordering
some
rum
and
water
and
a
pipe
of
tobacco
he
composed
himself
to
watch
for
the
arrival
of
those
witty
fellows
whom
he
suspected
would
presently
come
thither
to
see
the
end
of
their
prank
and
to
enjoy
his
confusion
the
spot
was
pleasant
enough
for
the
land
breeze
blowing
strong
and
cool
set
the
leaves
of
the
above
his
head
to
rattling
and
clattering
continually
against
the
darkness
of
the
sky
where
the
moon
then
being
half
full
they
shone
every
now
and
then
like
blades
of
steel
the
waves
also
were
splashing
up
against
the
little
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
sounding
mightily
pleasant
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
sparkling
all
over
the
harbor
where
the
moon
caught
the
edges
of
the
water
a
great
many
vessels
were
lying
at
anchor
in
their
ridings
with
the
dark
prodigious
form
of
a
looming
up
above
them
in
the
moonlight
there
our
hero
sat
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
smoking
his
pipe
of
tobacco
and
sipping
his
rum
and
water
yet
seeing
nothing
of
those
whom
he
suspected
might
presently
come
thither
to
laugh
at
him
it
was
not
far
from
half
after
the
hour
when
a
came
suddenly
out
of
the
night
and
pulled
up
to
the
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
and
three
or
four
men
came
ashore
in
the
darkness
they
landed
very
silently
and
walked
up
the
garden
pathway
without
saying
a
word
and
sitting
down
at
an
adjacent
table
ordered
rum
and
water
and
began
drinking
among
themselves
speaking
every
now
and
then
a
word
or
two
in
a
tongue
that
barnaby
did
not
well
understand
but
which
from
certain
phrases
they
let
fall
he
suspected
to
be
portuguese
our
hero
paid
no
great
attention
to
them
till
he
became
aware
that
they
had
fallen
to
whispering
together
and
were
regarding
him
very
curiously
he
felt
himself
growing
very
uneasy
under
this
observation
which
every
moment
grew
more
and
more
particular
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
suspect
that
this
interest
concerning
himself
might
have
somewhat
more
to
do
with
him
than
mere
idle
curiosity
when
one
of
the
men
who
was
plainly
the
captain
of
the
party
suddenly
says
to
him
how
now
messmate
wo
you
come
and
have
a
drop
of
drink
with
us
at
this
address
barnaby
instantly
began
to
be
aware
that
the
affair
he
had
come
upon
was
indeed
no
jest
as
he
had
supposed
it
to
be
but
that
he
had
walked
into
what
promised
to
be
a
very
pretty
adventure
nevertheless
not
wishing
to
be
too
hasty
in
his
conclusions
he
answered
very
civilly
that
he
had
drunk
enough
already
and
that
more
would
only
heat
his
blood
well
says
the
stranger
i
may
be
mistook
but
i
believe
you
are
barnaby
true
you
are
right
sir
and
that
is
my
name
acknowledged
barnaby
but
still
i
can
not
guess
how
that
may
concern
you
nor
why
it
should
be
a
reason
for
my
drinking
with
you
that
i
will
presently
tell
you
says
the
stranger
very
composedly
your
name
concerns
me
because
i
was
sent
here
to
tell
barnaby
true
that
royal
sovereign
is
come
to
be
sure
our
hero
heart
jumped
into
his
throat
at
those
words
his
pulse
began
beating
at
a
tremendous
rate
for
here
indeed
was
an
adventure
suddenly
opening
to
him
such
as
a
man
may
read
about
in
a
book
but
which
he
may
hardly
expect
to
befall
him
in
the
real
happenings
of
his
life
had
he
been
a
wiser
and
an
older
man
he
might
have
declined
the
whole
business
instead
of
walking
blindly
into
that
of
which
he
could
see
neither
the
beginning
nor
the
ending
but
being
barely
years
of
age
and
possessing
a
sanguine
temper
and
an
adventurous
disposition
that
would
have
carried
him
into
almost
anything
that
possessed
a
smack
of
uncertainty
or
danger
he
contrived
to
say
in
a
pretty
easy
tone
though
god
knows
how
it
was
put
on
for
the
occasion
well
if
that
be
so
and
if
the
is
indeed
come
in
why
then
i
join
you
since
you
are
so
kind
as
to
ask
me
therewith
he
arose
and
went
across
to
the
other
table
carrying
his
pipe
with
him
and
sat
down
and
began
smoking
with
all
the
appearance
of
ease
he
could
command
upon
the
occasion
at
this
the
other
burst
out
indeed
says
he
you
are
a
cool
blade
and
a
chip
of
the
old
block
but
harkee
young
gentleman
and
here
he
fell
serious
again
this
is
too
weighty
a
business
to
chance
any
mistake
in
a
name
i
believe
that
you
are
as
you
say
barnaby
true
but
nevertheless
to
make
perfectly
sure
i
must
ask
you
first
to
show
me
a
note
that
you
have
about
you
and
which
you
are
instructed
to
show
to
me
very
well
said
barnaby
i
have
it
here
safe
and
sound
and
you
shall
see
it
and
thereupon
and
without
more
ado
he
drew
out
his
wallet
opened
it
and
handed
the
other
the
mysterious
note
which
he
had
kept
carefully
by
him
ever
since
he
had
received
it
his
interlocutor
took
the
paper
and
drawing
to
him
the
candle
burning
there
for
the
convenience
of
those
who
would
smoke
tobacco
began
immediately
reading
it
this
gave
barnaby
true
a
moment
or
two
to
look
at
him
he
was
a
tall
lean
man
with
a
red
handkerchief
tied
around
his
neck
with
a
queue
of
red
hair
hanging
down
his
back
and
with
copper
buckles
on
his
shoes
so
that
barnaby
true
could
not
but
suspect
that
he
was
the
very
same
man
who
had
given
the
note
to
miss
eliza
bolles
at
the
door
of
his
is
all
right
and
straight
and
as
it
should
be
the
other
said
after
he
had
so
examined
the
note
and
now
that
the
paper
is
read
suiting
his
action
to
his
words
i
just
burn
it
for
sake
and
so
he
did
twisting
it
up
and
setting
it
to
the
flame
of
the
candle
and
now
he
said
continuing
his
address
i
tell
you
what
i
am
here
for
i
was
sent
to
ask
if
you
man
enough
to
take
your
life
in
your
hands
and
to
go
with
me
in
that
boat
down
yonder
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
say
and
we
start
away
without
wasting
more
time
for
the
devil
is
ashore
here
at
jamaica
though
you
do
know
what
that
means
and
if
he
gets
ahead
of
us
why
then
we
may
whistle
for
what
we
are
after
for
all
the
good
do
us
say
and
i
go
away
and
i
promise
you
you
shall
never
be
troubled
more
in
this
sort
of
a
way
so
now
speak
up
plain
young
gentleman
and
tell
us
what
is
your
wish
in
this
business
and
whether
you
will
adventure
any
further
or
no
if
our
hero
hesitated
it
was
not
for
long
and
when
he
spoke
up
it
was
with
a
voice
as
steady
as
could
be
to
be
sure
i
man
enough
to
go
with
you
says
he
and
if
you
mean
me
any
harm
i
can
look
out
for
myself
and
if
i
ca
then
here
is
something
can
look
out
for
me
and
therewith
he
lifted
up
the
flap
of
his
pocket
and
showed
the
butt
of
a
pistol
he
had
fetched
with
him
when
he
had
set
out
from
his
that
evening
at
this
the
other
burst
out
for
a
second
time
come
says
he
you
are
indeed
of
right
mettle
and
i
like
your
spirit
all
the
same
no
one
in
all
the
world
means
you
less
ill
than
i
and
so
if
you
have
to
use
that
barker
not
be
upon
us
who
are
your
friends
but
only
upon
one
who
is
more
wicked
than
the
devil
himself
so
now
if
you
are
prepared
and
have
made
up
your
mind
and
are
determined
to
see
this
affair
through
to
the
end
is
time
for
us
to
be
away
whereupon
our
hero
indicating
his
acquiescence
his
interlocutor
and
the
others
who
had
not
spoken
a
single
word
for
all
this
time
rose
together
from
the
table
and
the
stranger
having
paid
the
scores
of
all
they
went
down
together
to
the
boat
that
lay
plainly
awaiting
their
coming
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
thus
coming
to
it
our
hero
could
see
that
it
was
a
large
manned
by
half
a
score
of
black
men
for
rowers
and
that
there
were
two
lanterns
in
the
and
three
or
four
shovels
the
man
who
had
conducted
the
conversation
with
barnaby
true
for
all
this
time
and
who
was
as
has
been
said
plainly
the
captain
of
the
expedition
stepped
immediately
down
into
the
boat
our
hero
followed
and
the
others
followed
after
him
and
instantly
they
were
seated
the
boat
shoved
off
and
the
black
men
began
pulling
straight
out
into
the
harbor
and
so
at
some
distance
away
around
under
the
stern
of
the
not
a
word
was
spoken
after
they
had
thus
left
the
shore
and
they
might
all
have
been
so
many
spirits
for
the
silence
of
the
party
barnaby
true
was
too
full
of
his
own
thoughts
to
talk
and
serious
enough
thoughts
they
were
by
this
time
with
crimps
to
trepan
a
man
at
every
turn
and
to
carry
him
off
so
that
he
might
never
be
heard
of
again
as
for
the
others
they
did
not
seem
to
choose
to
say
anything
now
that
they
had
been
fairly
embarked
upon
their
enterprise
and
so
the
crew
pulled
away
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
the
leader
of
the
expedition
directing
the
course
of
the
boat
straight
across
the
harbor
as
though
towards
the
mouth
of
the
cobra
river
indeed
this
was
their
destination
as
barnaby
could
after
a
while
see
for
himself
by
the
low
point
of
land
with
a
great
long
row
of
growing
upon
it
the
appearance
of
which
he
knew
very
well
which
began
to
loom
up
from
the
dimness
of
the
moonlight
as
they
approached
the
river
they
found
the
tide
was
running
very
violently
so
that
it
gurgled
and
rippled
alongside
the
boat
as
the
crew
of
black
men
pulled
strongly
against
it
thus
rowing
slowly
against
the
stream
they
came
around
what
appeared
to
be
either
a
point
of
land
or
an
islet
covered
with
a
thick
growth
of
though
still
no
one
spoke
a
single
word
as
to
their
destination
or
what
was
the
business
they
had
in
hand
the
night
now
that
they
had
come
close
to
the
shore
appeared
to
be
full
of
the
noises
of
running
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
mud
and
marsh
and
over
all
was
the
whiteness
of
the
moonlight
with
a
few
stars
pricking
out
here
and
there
in
the
sky
and
everything
was
so
strange
and
mysterious
and
so
different
from
anything
that
he
had
experienced
before
that
barnaby
could
not
divest
himself
of
the
feeling
that
it
was
all
a
dream
from
which
at
any
moment
he
might
awaken
as
for
the
town
and
the
ordinary
he
had
quitted
such
a
short
time
before
so
different
were
they
from
this
present
experience
it
was
as
though
they
might
have
concerned
another
life
than
that
which
he
was
then
enjoying
meantime
the
rowers
bending
to
the
oars
the
boat
drew
slowly
around
into
the
open
water
once
more
as
it
did
so
the
leader
of
the
expedition
of
a
sudden
called
out
in
a
loud
commanding
voice
whereat
the
black
men
instantly
ceased
rowing
and
lay
on
their
oars
the
boat
drifting
onward
into
the
night
at
the
same
moment
of
time
our
hero
became
aware
of
another
boat
coming
down
the
river
towards
where
they
lay
this
other
boat
approaching
thus
strangely
through
the
darkness
was
full
of
men
some
of
them
armed
for
even
in
the
distance
barnaby
could
not
but
observe
that
the
light
of
the
moon
glimmered
now
and
then
as
upon
the
barrels
of
muskets
or
pistols
this
threw
him
into
a
good
deal
of
disquietude
of
mind
for
whether
they
or
this
boat
were
friends
or
enemies
or
as
to
what
was
to
happen
next
he
was
altogether
in
the
dark
upon
this
point
however
he
was
not
left
very
long
in
doubt
for
the
oarsmen
of
the
approaching
boat
continuing
to
row
steadily
onward
till
they
had
come
pretty
close
to
barnaby
and
his
companions
a
man
who
sat
in
the
stern
suddenly
stood
up
and
as
they
passed
by
shook
a
cane
at
barnaby
companion
with
a
most
threatening
and
angry
gesture
at
the
same
moment
the
moonlight
shining
full
upon
him
barnaby
could
see
him
as
plain
as
daylight
a
large
stout
gentleman
with
a
round
red
face
and
clad
in
a
fine
laced
coat
of
red
cloth
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
near
by
him
was
a
box
or
chest
about
the
bigness
of
a
but
covered
all
over
with
cakes
of
sand
and
dirt
in
the
act
of
passing
the
gentleman
still
standing
pointed
at
this
chest
with
his
cane
an
elegant
staff
and
roared
out
in
a
loud
voice
are
you
come
after
this
abram
dowling
then
come
and
take
it
and
thereat
as
he
sat
down
again
burst
out
as
though
what
he
had
said
was
the
wittiest
jest
conceivable
either
because
he
respected
the
armed
men
in
the
other
boat
or
else
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
the
captain
of
our
expedition
did
not
immediately
reply
but
sat
as
still
as
any
stone
but
at
last
the
other
boat
having
drifted
pretty
far
away
he
suddenly
found
words
to
shout
out
after
it
very
well
jack
malyoe
very
well
jack
malyoe
you
got
the
better
of
us
once
more
but
next
time
is
the
third
and
then
it
be
our
turn
even
if
william
brand
must
come
back
from
the
grave
to
settle
with
you
himself
but
to
this
my
fine
gentleman
in
boat
made
no
reply
except
to
burst
out
once
more
into
a
great
fit
of
laughter
there
was
however
still
another
man
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
a
villanous
lean
man
with
and
the
top
of
his
head
as
bald
as
an
apple
he
held
in
his
hand
a
great
pistol
which
he
flourished
about
him
crying
out
to
the
gentleman
beside
him
do
but
give
me
the
word
your
honor
and
i
put
another
bullet
through
the
son
of
a
sea
cook
but
the
other
forbade
him
and
therewith
the
boat
presently
melted
away
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
was
gone
this
happened
all
in
a
few
seconds
so
that
before
our
hero
understood
what
was
passing
he
found
the
boat
in
which
he
still
sat
drifting
silently
in
the
moonlight
for
no
one
spoke
for
awhile
and
the
oars
of
the
other
boat
sounding
farther
and
farther
away
into
the
distance
says
one
of
those
in
barnaby
boat
in
spanish
where
shall
you
go
now
at
this
the
leader
of
the
expedition
appeared
suddenly
to
come
back
to
himself
and
to
find
his
tongue
again
go
he
roared
out
go
to
the
devil
go
go
where
you
choose
go
go
back
again
that
where
well
go
and
therewith
he
fell
and
swearing
frothing
at
the
lips
as
though
he
had
gone
clean
crazy
while
the
black
men
bending
once
more
to
their
oars
rowed
back
again
across
the
harbor
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
lay
oars
to
the
water
they
put
barnaby
true
ashore
below
the
old
but
so
bewildered
and
amazed
by
all
that
had
happened
and
by
what
he
had
seen
and
by
the
names
he
had
heard
spoken
that
he
was
only
half
conscious
of
the
familiar
things
among
which
he
suddenly
found
himself
transported
the
moonlight
and
the
night
appeared
to
have
taken
upon
them
a
new
and
singular
aspect
and
he
walked
up
the
street
towards
his
lodging
like
one
drunk
or
in
a
dream
for
you
must
remember
that
john
malyoe
was
the
captain
of
the
galley
he
who
had
shot
barnaby
own
grandfather
and
abram
dowling
i
must
tell
you
had
been
the
gunner
of
the
he
who
had
been
shot
at
the
same
time
that
captain
brand
met
his
tragical
end
and
yet
these
names
he
had
heard
spoken
the
one
from
one
boat
and
the
other
from
the
other
so
that
he
could
not
but
wonder
what
sort
of
beings
they
were
among
whom
he
had
fallen
as
to
that
box
covered
all
over
with
mud
he
could
only
offer
a
conjecture
as
to
what
it
contained
and
as
to
what
the
finding
of
it
signified
but
of
this
our
hero
said
nothing
to
any
one
nor
did
he
tell
any
one
what
he
suspected
for
though
he
was
so
young
in
years
he
possessed
a
continent
disposition
inherited
from
his
father
who
had
been
one
of
ten
children
born
to
a
poor
but
worthy
presbyterian
minister
of
bluefield
connecticut
so
it
was
that
not
even
to
his
good
friend
greenfield
did
barnaby
say
a
word
as
to
what
had
happened
to
him
going
about
his
business
the
next
day
as
though
nothing
of
moment
had
occurred
but
he
was
not
destined
yet
to
be
done
with
those
beings
among
whom
he
had
fallen
that
night
for
that
which
he
supposed
to
be
the
ending
of
the
whole
affair
was
only
the
beginning
of
further
adventures
that
were
soon
to
befall
him
iv
greenfield
lived
in
a
fine
brick
house
just
outside
of
the
town
on
the
mona
road
his
family
consisted
of
a
wife
and
two
daughters
handsome
lively
young
ladies
with
very
fine
bright
teeth
that
shone
whenever
they
laughed
and
with
to
say
for
themselves
to
this
pleasant
house
barnaby
true
was
often
asked
to
a
family
dinner
after
which
he
and
his
good
kind
host
would
maybe
sit
upon
the
veranda
looking
out
towards
the
mountain
smoking
their
cigarros
while
the
young
ladies
laughed
and
talked
or
played
upon
the
guitar
and
sang
a
day
or
two
before
the
sailed
from
kingston
upon
her
return
voyage
to
new
york
greenfield
stopped
barnaby
true
as
he
was
passing
through
the
office
and
begged
him
to
come
to
dinner
that
night
for
within
the
tropics
you
are
to
know
they
breakfast
at
eleven
and
take
dinner
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
because
of
the
heat
and
not
at
as
we
do
in
more
temperate
latitudes
i
would
says
greenfield
have
you
meet
sir
john
malyoe
and
miss
marjorie
who
are
to
be
your
chief
passengers
for
new
york
and
for
whom
the
state
cabin
and
the
two
are
to
be
fitted
as
here
ordered
showing
a
letter
for
sir
john
hath
arranged
says
greenfield
for
the
captain
own
then
not
being
aware
of
barnaby
true
history
nor
that
captain
brand
was
his
grandfather
the
good
gentleman
calling
sir
john
jack
malyoe
goes
on
to
tell
our
hero
what
a
famous
pirate
he
had
been
and
how
it
was
he
who
had
shot
captain
brand
over
side
of
the
harbor
twenty
years
before
yes
says
he
is
the
same
jack
malyoe
though
grown
into
repute
and
importance
now
as
who
would
not
who
hath
had
the
to
fall
heir
to
a
baronetcy
and
a
landed
estate
and
so
it
befell
that
same
night
that
barnaby
true
once
again
beheld
the
man
who
had
murdered
his
own
grandfather
meeting
him
this
time
face
to
face
that
time
in
the
harbor
he
had
seen
sir
john
malyoe
at
a
distance
and
in
the
darkness
now
that
he
beheld
him
closer
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
seen
a
countenance
more
distasteful
to
him
in
all
his
life
not
that
the
man
was
altogether
ugly
for
he
had
a
good
enough
nose
and
a
fine
double
chin
but
his
eyes
stood
out
from
his
face
and
were
red
and
watery
and
he
winked
them
continually
as
though
they
were
always
his
lips
were
thick
and
and
his
cheeks
mottled
here
and
there
with
little
clots
of
veins
when
he
spoke
his
voice
rattled
in
his
throat
to
such
a
degree
that
it
made
one
wish
to
clear
one
own
throat
to
listen
to
him
so
what
with
a
pair
of
fat
white
hands
and
that
hoarse
voice
and
his
swollen
face
and
his
thick
lips
out
it
appeared
to
barnaby
true
he
had
never
beheld
a
countenance
that
pleased
him
so
little
but
if
sir
john
malyoe
suited
our
hero
taste
so
ill
the
granddaughter
was
in
the
same
degree
pleasing
to
him
she
had
a
thin
fair
skin
red
lips
and
yellow
hair
though
it
was
then
powdered
pretty
white
for
the
occasion
and
the
bluest
eyes
that
ever
he
beheld
in
all
of
his
life
a
sweet
timid
creature
who
appeared
not
to
dare
so
much
as
to
speak
a
word
for
herself
without
looking
to
that
great
beast
her
grandfather
for
leave
to
do
so
for
she
would
shrink
and
shudder
whenever
he
would
speak
of
a
sudden
to
her
or
direct
a
glance
upon
her
when
she
did
pluck
up
sufficient
courage
to
say
anything
it
was
in
so
low
a
voice
that
barnaby
was
obliged
to
bend
his
head
to
hear
her
and
when
she
smiled
she
would
as
like
as
not
catch
herself
short
and
look
up
as
though
to
see
if
she
did
amiss
to
be
cheerful
as
for
sir
john
he
sat
at
dinner
and
gobbled
and
ate
and
drank
smacking
his
lips
all
the
while
but
with
hardly
a
word
of
civility
either
to
greenfield
or
to
greenfield
or
to
barnaby
true
but
wearing
all
the
while
a
dull
sullen
air
as
though
he
would
say
your
damned
victuals
and
drink
are
no
better
than
they
should
be
but
such
as
they
are
i
must
eat
or
eat
nothing
it
was
only
after
dinner
was
over
and
the
young
lady
and
the
two
misses
off
in
a
corner
together
that
barnaby
heard
her
talk
with
any
degree
of
ease
then
to
be
sure
her
tongue
became
loose
enough
and
she
prattled
away
at
a
great
rate
though
hardly
above
her
breath
then
of
a
sudden
her
called
out
in
his
hoarse
rattling
voice
that
it
was
time
to
go
upon
which
she
stopped
short
in
what
she
was
saying
and
jumped
up
from
her
chair
looking
as
frightened
as
though
he
were
going
to
strike
her
with
that
cane
of
his
that
he
always
carried
with
him
barnaby
true
and
greenfield
both
went
out
to
see
the
two
into
their
coach
where
sir
john
man
stood
holding
the
lantern
and
who
should
he
be
to
be
sure
but
that
same
lean
villain
with
bald
head
who
had
offered
to
shoot
the
captain
of
barnaby
expedition
out
on
the
harbor
that
night
for
one
of
the
circles
of
light
shining
up
into
his
face
barnaby
true
knew
him
the
moment
he
clapped
eyes
upon
him
though
he
could
not
have
recognized
our
hero
he
grinned
at
him
in
the
most
impudent
familiar
fashion
and
never
so
much
as
touched
his
hat
either
to
him
or
to
greenfield
but
as
soon
as
his
master
and
his
young
mistress
had
entered
the
coach
banged
to
the
door
and
scrambled
up
on
the
seat
alongside
the
driver
and
so
away
without
a
word
but
with
another
impudent
grin
this
time
favoring
both
barnaby
and
the
old
gentleman
such
were
sir
john
malyoe
and
his
man
and
the
ill
opinion
our
hero
conceived
of
them
was
only
confirmed
by
further
observation
the
next
day
sir
john
malyoe
began
to
come
aboard
the
and
in
the
afternoon
that
same
lean
villanous
comes
skipping
across
the
gangplank
as
nimble
as
a
goat
with
two
black
men
behind
him
lugging
a
great
what
he
cries
out
and
so
you
is
the
supercargo
is
you
why
to
be
sure
i
thought
you
was
more
account
when
i
saw
you
last
night
talking
with
his
honor
like
his
equal
well
no
matter
says
he
is
something
to
have
a
brisk
genteel
young
fellow
for
a
supercargo
so
come
my
hearty
lend
a
hand
and
help
me
set
his
honor
cabin
to
rights
what
a
speech
was
this
to
endure
from
such
a
fellow
what
with
our
hero
distaste
for
the
villain
and
what
with
such
odious
familiarity
you
may
guess
into
what
temper
so
impudent
an
address
must
have
cast
him
says
he
you
find
the
steward
in
yonder
and
he
show
you
the
cabin
sir
john
is
to
occupy
therewith
he
turned
and
walked
away
with
prodigious
dignity
leaving
the
other
standing
where
he
was
as
he
went
below
to
his
own
he
could
not
but
see
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
that
the
fellow
was
still
standing
where
he
had
left
him
regarding
him
with
a
most
evil
malevolent
countenance
so
that
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
had
an
enemy
aboard
for
that
voyage
who
was
not
very
likely
to
forgive
or
forget
what
he
must
regard
as
so
mortifying
a
slight
as
that
which
barnaby
had
put
upon
him
the
next
day
sir
john
malyoe
himself
came
aboard
accompanied
by
his
granddaughter
and
followed
by
his
man
and
he
followed
again
by
four
black
men
who
carried
among
them
two
trunks
not
large
in
size
but
vastly
heavy
in
weight
towards
these
two
trunks
sir
john
and
his
follower
devoted
the
utmost
solicitude
and
care
to
see
that
they
were
properly
carried
into
the
cabin
he
was
to
occupy
barnaby
true
was
standing
in
the
saloon
as
they
passed
close
by
him
but
though
sir
john
looked
hard
at
him
and
straight
in
the
face
he
never
so
much
as
spoke
a
single
word
to
our
hero
or
showed
by
a
look
or
a
sign
that
he
had
ever
met
him
before
at
this
the
who
saw
it
all
with
eyes
as
quick
as
a
cat
fell
to
grinning
and
chuckling
to
see
barnaby
in
his
turn
so
slighted
the
young
lady
who
also
saw
it
blushed
as
red
as
fire
and
thereupon
delivered
a
courtesy
to
poor
barnaby
with
a
most
sweet
and
gracious
affability
there
were
besides
sir
john
and
the
young
lady
but
two
other
passengers
who
upon
this
occasion
took
the
voyage
to
new
york
the
reverend
simon
styles
master
of
a
flourishing
academy
at
spanish
town
and
his
wife
this
was
a
good
worthy
couple
of
an
extremely
quiet
disposition
saying
little
or
nothing
but
contented
to
sit
in
the
great
cabin
by
the
hour
together
reading
in
some
book
or
other
so
what
with
the
retiring
humor
of
the
worthy
pair
and
what
with
sir
john
malyoe
fancy
for
staying
all
the
time
shut
up
in
his
own
cabin
with
those
two
trunks
he
held
so
precious
it
fell
upon
barnaby
true
in
great
part
to
show
that
attention
to
the
young
lady
that
the
circumstances
demanded
this
he
did
with
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
to
himself
as
any
one
may
suppose
who
considers
a
spirited
young
man
of
years
of
age
and
a
sweet
and
beautiful
young
miss
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
thrown
thus
together
day
after
day
for
above
two
weeks
accordingly
the
weather
being
very
fair
and
the
ship
driving
freely
along
before
a
fine
breeze
and
they
having
no
other
occupation
than
to
sit
talking
together
all
day
gazing
at
the
blue
sea
and
the
bright
sky
overhead
it
is
not
difficult
to
conceive
of
what
was
to
befall
but
oh
those
days
when
a
man
is
young
and
whether
wisely
or
no
fallen
into
such
a
transport
of
passion
as
poor
barnaby
true
suffered
at
that
time
how
often
during
that
voyage
did
our
hero
lie
awake
in
his
berth
at
night
tossing
this
way
and
that
without
finding
any
refreshment
of
sleep
perhaps
all
because
her
hand
had
touched
his
or
because
she
had
spoken
some
word
to
him
that
had
possessed
him
with
a
ravishing
disquietude
all
this
might
not
have
befallen
him
had
sir
john
malyoe
looked
after
his
granddaughter
instead
of
locking
himself
up
day
and
night
in
his
own
cabin
scarce
venturing
out
except
to
devour
his
food
or
maybe
to
take
two
or
three
turns
across
the
deck
before
returning
again
to
the
care
of
those
chests
he
appeared
to
hold
so
much
more
precious
than
his
own
flesh
and
blood
nor
was
it
to
be
supposed
that
barnaby
would
take
the
pains
to
consider
what
was
to
become
of
it
all
for
what
young
man
so
situated
as
he
but
would
be
perfectly
content
to
live
so
agreeably
in
a
fool
paradise
satisfying
himself
by
assigning
the
whole
affair
to
the
future
to
take
care
of
itself
accordingly
our
hero
endeavored
and
with
pretty
good
success
to
put
away
from
him
whatever
doubts
might
arise
in
his
own
mind
concerning
what
he
was
about
satisfying
himself
with
making
his
conversation
as
agreeable
to
his
companion
as
it
lay
in
his
power
to
do
so
the
affair
continued
until
the
end
of
the
whole
business
came
with
a
suddenness
that
promised
for
a
time
to
cast
our
hero
into
the
utmost
depths
of
humiliation
and
despair
at
that
time
the
was
according
to
captain
reckoning
computed
that
day
at
noon
bearing
about
leagues
off
the
harbor
of
charleston
in
south
carolina
nor
was
our
hero
likely
to
forget
for
many
years
afterwards
even
the
smallest
circumstance
of
that
occasion
he
may
remember
that
it
was
a
mightily
sweet
balmy
evening
the
sun
not
having
set
above
half
an
hour
before
and
the
sky
still
suffused
with
a
good
deal
of
brightness
the
air
being
extremely
soft
and
mild
he
may
remember
with
the
utmost
nicety
how
they
were
leaning
over
the
rail
of
the
vessel
looking
out
towards
the
westward
she
fallen
mightily
quiet
as
though
occupied
with
very
serious
thoughts
of
a
sudden
she
began
without
any
preface
whatever
to
speak
to
barnaby
about
herself
and
her
affairs
in
a
most
confidential
manner
such
as
she
had
never
used
to
him
before
she
told
him
that
she
and
her
grandfather
were
going
to
new
york
that
they
might
take
passage
thence
to
boston
in
massachusetts
where
they
were
to
meet
her
cousin
captain
malyoe
who
was
stationed
in
garrison
at
that
place
continuing
she
said
that
captain
malyoe
was
the
next
heir
to
the
devonshire
estate
and
that
she
and
he
were
to
be
married
in
the
fall
you
may
conceive
into
what
a
confusion
of
distress
such
a
confession
as
this
delivered
so
suddenly
must
have
cast
poor
barnaby
he
could
answer
her
not
a
single
word
but
stood
staring
in
another
direction
than
hers
endeavoring
to
compose
himself
into
some
equanimity
of
spirit
for
indeed
it
was
a
sudden
terrible
blow
and
his
breath
came
as
hot
and
dry
as
ashes
in
his
throat
meanwhile
the
young
lady
went
on
to
say
though
in
a
mightily
constrained
voice
that
she
had
liked
him
from
the
very
first
moment
she
had
seen
him
and
had
been
very
happy
for
these
days
she
had
passed
in
his
society
and
that
she
would
always
think
of
him
as
a
dear
friend
who
had
been
very
kind
to
her
who
had
so
little
pleasure
in
her
life
at
last
barnaby
made
shift
to
say
though
in
a
hoarse
and
croaking
voice
that
captain
malyoe
must
be
a
very
happy
man
and
that
if
he
were
in
captain
malyoe
place
he
would
be
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
thereupon
having
so
found
his
voice
he
went
on
to
tell
her
though
in
a
prodigious
confusion
and
perturbation
of
spirit
that
he
too
loved
her
and
that
what
she
had
told
him
struck
him
to
the
heart
and
made
him
the
most
miserable
unhappy
wretch
in
the
whole
world
she
exhibited
no
anger
at
what
he
said
nor
did
she
turn
to
look
at
him
but
only
replied
in
a
low
voice
that
he
should
not
talk
so
for
that
it
could
only
be
a
pain
to
them
both
to
speak
of
such
things
and
that
whether
she
would
or
no
she
must
do
everything
her
grandfather
bade
her
he
being
indeed
a
terrible
man
to
this
poor
barnaby
could
only
repeat
that
he
loved
her
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
hoped
for
nothing
in
his
love
but
that
he
was
now
the
most
miserable
man
in
the
world
it
was
at
this
moment
so
momentous
to
our
hero
that
some
one
who
had
been
hiding
unseen
nigh
them
for
all
the
while
suddenly
moved
away
and
barnaby
in
spite
of
the
gathering
darkness
could
perceive
that
it
was
that
villain
of
sir
john
malyoe
nor
could
he
but
know
that
the
wretch
must
have
overheard
all
that
had
been
said
as
he
looked
he
beheld
this
fellow
go
straight
to
the
great
cabin
where
he
disappeared
with
a
cunning
leer
upon
his
face
so
that
our
hero
could
not
but
be
aware
that
the
purpose
of
the
eavesdropper
must
be
to
communicate
all
that
he
had
overheard
to
his
master
at
this
thought
the
last
drop
of
bitterness
was
added
to
his
trouble
for
what
could
be
more
distressing
to
any
man
of
honor
than
to
possess
the
consciousness
that
such
a
wretch
should
have
overheard
so
sacred
a
conversation
as
that
which
he
had
enjoyed
with
the
young
lady
she
upon
her
part
could
not
have
been
aware
that
the
man
had
listened
to
what
she
had
been
saying
for
she
still
continued
leaning
over
the
rail
and
barnaby
remained
standing
by
her
side
without
moving
but
so
distracted
by
a
tumult
of
many
passions
that
he
knew
not
how
or
where
to
look
after
a
pretty
long
time
of
this
silence
the
young
lady
looked
up
to
see
why
her
companion
had
not
spoken
for
so
great
a
while
and
at
that
very
moment
sir
john
malyoe
comes
flinging
out
of
the
cabin
without
his
hat
but
carrying
his
cane
he
ran
straight
across
the
deck
towards
where
barnaby
and
the
young
lady
stood
swinging
his
cane
this
way
and
that
with
a
most
furious
and
threatening
countenance
while
the
informer
grinning
like
an
ape
followed
close
at
his
heels
as
sir
john
approached
them
he
cried
out
in
so
loud
a
voice
that
all
on
deck
might
have
heard
him
you
hussy
and
all
the
time
you
are
to
remember
he
was
swinging
his
cane
as
though
he
would
have
struck
the
young
lady
who
upon
her
part
shrank
back
from
him
almost
upon
the
deck
as
though
to
escape
such
a
blow
you
hussy
what
do
you
do
here
talking
with
a
misbred
yankee
supercargo
not
fit
for
a
gentlewoman
to
wipe
her
feet
upon
and
you
stand
there
and
listen
to
his
fool
talk
go
to
your
room
you
hussy
only
was
something
worse
he
called
her
this
time
before
i
lay
this
cane
across
you
you
may
suppose
into
what
fury
such
words
as
these
spoken
in
hearing
not
to
mention
that
vile
slur
set
upon
himself
must
have
cast
our
hero
to
be
sure
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
did
but
he
put
his
hand
against
sir
john
malyoe
breast
and
thrust
him
back
most
violently
crying
out
upon
him
at
the
same
time
for
daring
so
to
threaten
a
young
lady
and
that
for
a
farthing
he
would
wrench
the
stick
out
of
his
hand
and
throw
it
overboard
a
little
farther
and
sir
john
would
have
fallen
flat
upon
the
deck
with
the
push
barnaby
gave
him
but
he
contrived
by
catching
hold
of
the
rail
to
save
his
balance
whereupon
having
recovered
himself
he
came
running
at
our
hero
like
a
wild
beast
whirling
his
cane
about
and
i
do
believe
would
have
struck
him
and
god
knows
then
what
might
have
happened
had
not
his
caught
him
and
held
him
back
keep
back
cried
out
our
hero
still
mighty
hoarse
keep
back
if
you
strike
me
with
that
stick
i
fling
you
overboard
by
this
time
what
with
the
sound
of
loud
voices
and
the
stamping
of
feet
some
of
the
crew
and
others
aboard
were
hurrying
up
to
the
scene
of
action
at
the
same
time
captain
manly
and
the
first
mate
freesden
came
running
out
of
the
cabin
as
for
our
hero
having
got
set
agoing
he
was
not
to
be
stopped
so
easily
and
who
are
you
anyhow
he
cries
his
voice
mightily
hoarse
even
in
his
own
ears
to
threaten
to
strike
me
you
may
be
a
bloody
pirate
and
you
may
shoot
a
man
from
behind
as
you
shot
poor
captain
brand
on
the
cobra
river
but
you
wo
dare
strike
me
face
to
face
i
know
who
you
are
and
what
you
are
as
for
sir
john
malyoe
had
he
been
struck
of
a
sudden
by
palsy
he
could
not
have
stopped
more
dead
short
in
his
attack
upon
our
hero
there
he
stood
his
great
bulging
eyes
staring
like
those
of
a
fish
his
face
as
purple
as
a
cherry
as
for
master
informer
barnaby
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
he
had
stopped
his
grinning
by
now
and
was
holding
his
master
arm
as
though
to
restrain
him
from
any
further
act
of
violence
by
this
time
captain
manly
had
come
bustling
up
and
demanded
to
know
what
all
the
disturbance
meant
whereupon
our
hero
cried
out
still
in
the
extremity
of
passion
the
villain
insulted
me
and
insulted
the
young
lady
he
threatened
to
strike
me
with
his
cane
but
he
strike
me
i
know
who
he
is
and
what
he
is
i
know
what
he
got
in
his
cabin
in
those
two
trunks
and
i
know
where
he
found
it
and
whom
it
belongs
to
at
this
captain
manly
clapped
his
hand
upon
our
hero
shoulder
and
fell
to
shaking
him
so
that
he
could
hardly
stand
crying
out
to
him
the
while
to
be
silent
says
he
how
do
you
dare
an
officer
of
this
ship
to
quarrel
with
a
passenger
of
mine
go
straight
to
your
cabin
and
stay
there
till
i
give
you
leave
to
come
out
again
at
this
master
barnaby
came
somewhat
back
to
himself
but
he
threatened
to
strike
me
with
his
cane
he
says
and
that
i
stand
from
any
man
no
matter
for
that
says
captain
manly
very
sternly
go
to
your
cabin
as
i
bid
you
and
stay
there
till
i
tell
you
to
come
out
again
and
when
we
get
to
new
york
i
take
pains
to
inform
your
of
how
you
have
behaved
i
have
no
such
rioting
as
this
aboard
my
ship
by
this
time
as
you
may
suppose
the
young
lady
was
gone
as
for
sir
john
malyoe
he
stood
in
the
light
of
a
lantern
his
face
that
had
been
so
red
now
gone
as
white
as
ashes
and
if
a
look
could
kill
to
be
sure
he
would
have
destroyed
barnaby
true
where
he
stood
it
was
thus
that
the
events
of
that
memorable
day
came
to
a
conclusion
how
little
did
any
of
the
actors
of
the
scene
suspect
that
a
portentous
fate
was
overhanging
them
and
was
so
soon
to
transform
all
their
present
circumstances
into
others
that
were
to
be
perfectly
different
and
how
little
did
our
hero
suspect
what
was
in
store
for
him
upon
the
morrow
as
with
hanging
head
he
went
to
his
cabin
and
shutting
the
door
upon
himself
and
flinging
himself
down
upon
his
berth
there
yielded
himself
over
to
the
profoundest
depths
of
humiliation
and
despair
v
from
his
melancholy
meditations
barnaby
and
in
spite
of
himself
began
dropping
off
into
a
loose
slumber
disturbed
by
extravagant
dreams
of
all
sorts
in
which
sir
john
malyoe
played
some
important
and
malignant
part
from
one
of
these
dreams
he
was
aroused
to
meet
a
new
and
startling
fate
by
hearing
the
sudden
and
violent
explosion
of
a
ring
out
as
though
in
his
ears
this
was
followed
immediately
by
the
sound
of
several
other
shots
exchanged
in
rapid
succession
as
coming
from
the
deck
above
at
the
same
instant
a
blow
of
such
excessive
violence
shook
the
that
the
vessel
heeled
over
before
it
and
barnaby
was
at
once
aware
that
another
craft
whether
by
accident
or
with
intention
he
did
not
know
must
have
run
afoul
of
them
upon
this
point
and
as
to
whether
or
not
the
collision
was
designed
he
was
however
not
left
a
moment
in
doubt
for
even
as
the
righted
to
her
true
keel
there
was
the
sound
of
many
footsteps
running
across
the
deck
and
down
into
the
great
cabin
then
proceeded
a
prodigious
uproar
of
voices
together
with
the
struggling
of
bodies
being
tossed
about
striking
violently
against
the
partitions
and
bulkheads
at
the
same
instant
arose
a
screaming
of
women
voices
and
one
voice
that
of
sir
john
malyoe
crying
out
as
in
the
greatest
extremity
you
villains
you
damned
villains
and
with
that
the
sudden
detonation
of
a
pistol
fired
into
the
close
space
of
the
great
cabin
long
before
this
time
barnaby
was
out
in
the
middle
of
his
own
cabin
taking
only
sufficient
time
to
snatch
down
one
of
the
pistols
that
hung
at
the
head
of
his
berth
he
flung
out
into
the
great
cabin
to
find
it
as
black
as
night
the
lantern
slung
there
having
been
either
blown
out
or
dashed
out
into
darkness
all
was
as
black
as
coal
and
the
gloom
was
filled
with
a
hubbub
of
uproar
and
confusion
above
which
sounded
continually
the
shrieking
of
women
voices
nor
had
our
hero
taken
above
a
couple
of
steps
before
he
pitched
headlong
over
two
or
three
men
struggling
together
upon
the
deck
falling
with
a
great
clatter
and
the
loss
of
his
pistol
which
however
he
regained
almost
immediately
what
all
the
uproar
portended
he
could
only
guess
but
presently
hearing
captain
manly
voice
calling
out
you
bloody
pirate
would
you
choke
me
to
death
he
became
immediately
aware
of
what
had
befallen
the
and
that
they
had
been
attacked
by
some
of
those
buccaneers
who
at
that
time
infested
the
waters
of
america
in
prodigious
numbers
it
was
with
this
thought
in
his
mind
that
looking
towards
the
companionway
he
beheld
outlined
against
the
darkness
of
the
night
without
the
form
of
a
man
figure
standing
still
and
motionless
as
a
statue
in
the
midst
of
all
this
tumult
and
thereupon
as
by
some
instinct
knew
that
that
must
be
the
of
all
this
brew
therewith
still
kneeling
upon
the
deck
he
covered
the
bosom
of
that
figure
as
he
supposed
with
his
pistol
and
instantly
pulled
the
trigger
in
the
light
of
the
pistol
fire
barnaby
had
only
sufficient
opportunity
to
distinguish
a
flat
face
wearing
a
large
pair
of
mustachios
a
cocked
hat
trimmed
with
gold
lace
a
red
scarf
and
brass
buttons
then
the
darkness
very
thick
and
black
again
swallowed
everything
but
if
our
hero
failed
to
clearly
perceive
the
countenance
towards
which
he
had
discharged
his
weapon
there
was
one
who
appeared
to
have
recognized
some
likeness
in
it
for
sir
john
malyoe
voice
almost
at
barnaby
elbow
cried
out
thrice
in
loud
and
violent
tones
william
brand
william
brand
william
brand
and
thereat
came
the
sound
of
some
heavy
body
falling
down
upon
the
deck
this
was
the
last
that
our
hero
may
remember
of
that
notable
attack
for
the
next
moment
whether
by
accident
or
design
he
never
knew
he
felt
himself
struck
so
terrible
a
blow
upon
the
side
of
the
head
that
he
instantly
swooned
dead
away
and
knew
no
more
vi
when
barnaby
true
came
back
to
his
senses
again
it
was
to
become
aware
that
he
was
being
cared
for
with
great
skill
and
nicety
that
his
head
had
been
bathed
with
cold
water
and
that
a
bandage
was
being
bound
about
it
as
carefully
as
though
a
chirurgeon
was
attending
to
him
he
had
been
half
conscious
of
people
about
him
but
could
not
immediately
recall
what
had
happened
to
him
nor
until
he
had
opened
his
eyes
to
find
himself
in
a
perfectly
strange
cabin
of
narrow
dimensions
but
extremely
well
fitted
and
painted
with
white
and
gold
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
shining
in
his
eyes
together
with
the
gray
of
the
early
day
through
the
deadlight
he
could
perceive
that
two
men
were
bending
over
him
one
a
negro
in
a
striped
shirt
with
a
yellow
handkerchief
around
his
head
and
silver
in
his
ears
the
other
a
white
man
clad
in
a
strange
outlandish
dress
of
a
foreign
make
with
great
mustachios
hanging
down
below
his
chin
and
with
gold
in
his
ears
it
was
this
last
who
was
attending
to
barnaby
hurt
with
such
extreme
care
and
gentleness
all
this
barnaby
saw
with
his
first
clear
consciousness
after
his
swoon
then
remembering
what
had
befallen
him
and
his
head
beating
as
though
it
would
split
asunder
he
shut
his
eyes
again
contriving
with
great
effort
to
keep
himself
from
groaning
aloud
and
wondering
as
to
what
sort
of
pirates
these
could
be
who
would
first
knock
a
man
in
the
head
so
terrible
a
blow
as
that
which
he
had
suffered
and
then
take
such
care
to
fetch
him
back
to
life
again
and
to
make
him
easy
and
comfortable
nor
did
he
open
his
eyes
again
but
lay
there
marvelling
thus
until
the
bandage
was
properly
tied
about
his
head
and
sewed
together
then
once
more
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
to
ask
where
he
was
upon
hearing
him
speak
his
attendants
showed
excessive
signs
of
joy
nodding
their
heads
and
smiling
at
him
as
though
to
reassure
him
but
either
because
they
did
not
choose
to
reply
or
else
because
they
could
not
speak
english
they
made
no
answer
excepting
by
those
signs
and
gestures
the
white
man
however
made
several
motions
that
our
hero
was
to
arise
and
still
grinning
and
nodding
his
head
pointed
as
though
towards
a
saloon
beyond
at
the
same
time
the
negro
held
up
our
hero
coat
and
beckoned
for
him
to
put
it
on
accordingly
barnaby
seeing
that
it
was
required
of
him
to
quit
the
place
in
which
he
then
lay
arose
though
with
a
good
deal
of
effort
and
permitted
the
negro
to
help
him
on
with
his
coat
though
feeling
mightily
dizzy
and
much
put
about
to
keep
upon
his
legs
his
head
beating
fit
to
split
asunder
and
the
vessel
rolling
and
pitching
at
a
great
rate
as
though
upon
a
heavy
so
still
sick
and
dizzy
he
went
out
into
what
he
found
was
indeed
a
fine
saloon
beyond
painted
in
white
and
gilt
like
the
cabin
he
had
just
quitted
this
saloon
was
fitted
in
the
most
excellent
taste
imaginable
a
table
extended
the
length
of
the
room
and
a
quantity
of
bottles
and
glasses
clear
as
crystal
were
arranged
in
rows
in
a
hanging
rack
above
but
what
most
attracted
our
hero
attention
was
a
man
sitting
with
his
back
to
him
his
figure
clad
in
a
rough
and
with
a
red
handkerchief
tied
around
his
throat
his
feet
were
stretched
under
the
table
out
before
him
and
he
was
smoking
a
pipe
of
tobacco
with
all
the
ease
and
comfort
imaginable
as
barnaby
came
in
he
turned
round
and
to
the
profound
astonishment
of
our
hero
presented
to
him
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
the
dawn
shining
pretty
strong
through
the
skylight
the
face
of
that
very
man
who
had
conducted
the
mysterious
expedition
that
night
across
kingston
harbor
to
the
cobra
river
vii
this
man
looked
steadily
at
barnaby
true
for
above
half
a
minute
and
then
burst
out
and
indeed
barnaby
standing
there
with
the
bandage
about
his
head
must
have
looked
a
very
droll
picture
of
that
astonishment
he
felt
so
profoundly
at
finding
who
was
this
pirate
into
whose
hands
he
had
fallen
well
says
the
other
and
so
you
be
up
at
last
and
no
great
harm
done
i
be
bound
and
how
does
your
head
feel
by
now
my
young
master
to
this
barnaby
made
no
reply
but
what
with
wonder
and
the
dizziness
of
his
head
seated
himself
at
the
table
over
against
his
interlocutor
who
pushed
a
bottle
of
rum
towards
him
together
with
a
glass
from
the
hanging
rack
he
watched
barnaby
fill
his
glass
and
so
soon
as
he
had
done
so
began
immediately
by
saying
i
do
suppose
you
think
you
were
treated
mightily
ill
to
be
so
handled
last
night
well
so
you
were
treated
ill
enough
though
who
hit
you
that
crack
upon
the
head
i
know
no
more
than
a
child
unborn
well
i
am
sorry
for
the
way
you
were
handled
but
there
is
this
much
to
say
and
of
that
you
may
feel
well
assured
that
nothing
was
meant
to
you
but
kindness
and
before
you
are
through
with
us
all
you
will
believe
that
without
my
having
to
tell
you
so
here
he
helped
himself
to
a
taste
of
grog
and
sucking
in
his
lips
went
on
again
with
what
he
had
to
say
do
you
remember
says
he
that
expedition
of
ours
in
kingston
harbor
and
how
we
were
all
of
us
balked
that
night
then
without
waiting
for
barnaby
reply
and
do
you
remember
what
i
said
to
that
villain
jack
malyoe
that
night
as
his
boat
went
by
us
i
says
to
him
malyoe
says
i
got
the
better
of
us
once
again
but
next
time
it
will
be
our
turn
even
if
william
brand
himself
has
to
come
back
from
the
grave
to
settle
with
you
i
remember
something
of
the
sort
said
barnaby
but
i
profess
i
am
all
in
the
dark
as
to
what
you
are
driving
at
at
this
the
other
burst
out
in
a
great
fit
of
laughing
very
well
then
said
he
this
night
work
is
only
the
ending
of
what
was
so
ill
begun
there
look
yonder
pointing
to
a
corner
of
the
cabin
and
then
maybe
you
will
be
in
the
dark
no
longer
barnaby
turned
his
head
and
there
beheld
in
the
corner
of
the
saloon
those
very
two
that
sir
john
malyoe
had
been
so
particular
to
keep
in
his
cabin
and
under
his
own
eyes
through
all
the
voyage
from
jamaica
i
show
you
what
is
in
says
the
other
and
thereupon
arose
and
barnaby
with
him
and
so
went
over
to
where
the
two
stood
our
hero
had
a
strong
enough
suspicion
as
to
what
the
cases
contained
but
lord
what
were
suspicions
to
what
his
two
eyes
beheld
when
that
man
lifted
the
lid
of
one
of
them
the
locks
thereof
having
already
been
forced
and
flinging
it
back
displayed
to
barnaby
astonished
and
bedazzled
sight
a
great
treasure
of
gold
and
silver
some
of
it
tied
up
in
leathern
bags
to
be
sure
but
so
many
of
the
coins
big
and
little
yellow
and
white
lying
loose
in
the
cases
as
to
make
our
hero
think
that
a
great
part
of
the
treasures
of
the
indies
lay
there
before
him
well
and
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
the
other
is
it
not
enough
for
a
man
to
turn
pirate
for
and
thereupon
burst
out
and
clapped
down
the
lid
again
then
suddenly
turning
serious
come
master
barnaby
says
he
i
am
to
have
some
very
sober
talk
with
you
so
fill
up
your
glass
again
and
then
we
will
heave
at
it
nor
even
in
after
years
nor
in
the
light
of
that
which
afterwards
occurred
could
barnaby
repeat
all
that
was
said
to
him
upon
that
occasion
for
what
with
the
pounding
and
beating
of
his
aching
head
and
what
with
the
wonder
of
what
he
had
seen
he
was
altogether
in
the
dark
as
to
the
greater
part
of
what
the
other
told
him
that
other
began
by
saying
that
barnaby
instead
of
being
sorry
that
he
was
william
brand
grandson
might
thank
god
for
it
that
he
barnaby
had
been
watched
and
cared
for
for
twenty
years
in
more
ways
than
he
would
ever
know
that
sir
john
malyoe
had
been
watched
also
for
all
that
while
and
that
it
was
a
vastly
strange
thing
that
sir
john
debts
in
england
and
barnaby
coming
of
age
should
have
brought
them
so
together
in
jamaica
though
after
all
it
was
all
for
the
best
as
barnaby
himself
should
presently
see
and
thank
god
for
that
also
for
now
all
the
debts
against
that
villain
jack
malyoe
were
settled
in
full
principal
and
interest
to
the
last
penny
and
barnaby
was
to
enjoy
it
the
most
of
all
here
the
fellow
took
a
very
comfortable
sip
of
his
grog
and
then
went
on
to
say
with
a
very
cunning
and
knowing
wink
of
the
eye
that
barnaby
was
not
the
only
passenger
aboard
but
that
there
was
another
in
whose
company
he
would
be
glad
enough
no
doubt
to
finish
the
balance
of
the
voyage
he
was
now
upon
so
now
if
barnaby
was
sufficiently
composed
he
should
be
introduced
to
that
other
passenger
thereupon
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
incontinently
arose
and
putting
away
the
bottle
of
rum
and
the
glasses
went
across
the
saloon
barnaby
watching
him
all
the
while
like
a
man
in
a
dream
and
opened
the
door
of
a
cabin
like
that
which
barnaby
had
occupied
a
little
while
before
he
was
gone
only
for
a
moment
for
almost
immediately
he
came
out
again
ushering
a
lady
before
him
by
now
the
daylight
in
the
cabin
was
grown
strong
and
clear
so
that
the
light
shining
full
upon
her
face
barnaby
true
knew
her
the
instant
she
appeared
it
was
miss
marjorie
malyoe
very
white
but
strangely
composed
showing
no
terror
either
in
her
countenance
or
in
her
expression
it
would
not
be
possible
for
the
writer
to
give
any
clear
idea
of
the
circumstances
of
the
days
that
immediately
followed
and
which
within
a
week
brought
barnaby
true
and
the
enchanting
object
of
his
affections
at
once
to
the
ending
of
their
voyage
and
of
all
these
marvellous
adventures
for
when
in
after
times
our
hero
would
endeavor
to
revive
a
memory
of
the
several
occurrences
that
then
transpired
they
all
appeared
as
though
in
a
dream
or
a
bewitching
phantasm
all
that
he
could
recall
were
long
days
of
delicious
enjoyment
followed
by
nights
of
dreaming
but
how
enchanting
those
days
how
exquisite
the
distraction
of
those
nights
upon
occasions
he
and
his
charmer
might
sit
together
under
the
shade
of
the
sail
for
an
hour
at
a
stretch
he
holding
her
hand
in
his
and
neither
saying
a
single
word
though
at
times
the
transports
of
poor
barnaby
emotions
would
go
far
to
suffocate
him
with
their
rapture
as
for
her
face
at
such
moments
it
appeared
sometimes
to
assume
a
transparency
as
though
of
a
light
shining
from
behind
her
countenance
the
vessel
in
which
they
found
themselves
was
a
brigantine
of
good
size
and
build
but
manned
by
a
considerable
crew
the
most
strange
and
outlandish
in
their
appearance
that
barnaby
had
ever
beheld
for
some
were
white
some
were
yellow
and
some
were
black
and
all
were
tricked
out
with
gay
colors
and
gold
in
their
ears
and
some
with
long
mustachios
and
others
with
handkerchiefs
tied
around
their
heads
and
all
these
spoke
together
a
jargon
of
which
barnaby
true
could
not
understand
a
single
word
but
which
might
have
been
portuguese
from
one
or
two
phrases
he
afterwards
remembered
nor
did
this
outlandish
crew
of
god
knows
what
sort
of
men
address
any
of
their
conversation
either
to
barnaby
or
to
the
young
lady
they
might
now
and
then
have
looked
at
him
and
her
out
of
the
corners
of
their
yellow
eyes
but
that
was
all
otherwise
they
were
indeed
like
the
creatures
of
a
dream
only
he
who
was
commander
of
this
strange
craft
when
he
would
come
down
into
the
saloon
to
mix
a
glass
of
grog
or
to
light
a
pipe
of
tobacco
would
maybe
favor
barnaby
with
a
few
words
concerning
the
weather
or
something
of
the
sort
and
then
to
go
on
deck
again
about
his
business
indeed
it
may
be
affirmed
with
pretty
easy
security
that
no
such
adventure
as
this
ever
happened
before
for
here
were
these
two
innocent
young
creatures
upon
board
of
a
craft
that
no
one
under
such
circumstances
as
those
recounted
above
could
doubt
was
a
pirate
or
buccaneer
the
crew
whereof
had
seen
no
one
knows
what
wicked
deeds
yet
they
two
as
remote
from
all
that
and
as
profoundly
occupied
with
the
transports
of
their
passion
and
as
innocent
in
their
satisfaction
thereof
as
were
corydon
and
phyllis
beside
their
purling
streams
and
flowery
meads
with
nymphs
and
satyrs
caracoling
about
them
viii
it
is
probable
that
the
polite
reader
of
this
veracious
narrative
instead
of
considering
it
as
the
effort
of
the
author
to
set
before
him
a
sober
and
history
has
been
all
this
while
amusing
himself
by
regarding
it
only
as
a
fanciful
tale
designed
for
his
entertainment
if
this
be
so
the
writer
may
hardly
hope
to
convince
him
that
what
is
to
follow
is
a
serious
narrative
of
that
which
though
never
so
ingenuous
in
its
recapitulation
is
an
altogether
inexplicable
phenomenon
accordingly
it
is
with
extraordinary
hesitation
that
the
scribe
now
invites
the
confidence
of
his
reader
in
the
succinct
truth
of
that
which
he
has
to
relate
it
is
in
brief
as
follows
that
upon
the
last
night
of
this
part
of
his
voyage
barnaby
true
was
awakened
from
slumber
by
flashes
of
lightning
shining
into
his
cabin
and
by
the
loud
pealing
of
approaching
thunder
at
the
same
time
observing
the
sound
of
footsteps
moving
back
and
forth
as
in
great
agitation
overhead
and
the
loud
shouting
of
orders
he
became
aware
that
a
violent
squall
of
wind
must
be
approaching
the
vessel
being
convinced
of
this
he
arose
from
his
berth
dressed
quickly
and
hurried
upon
deck
where
he
found
a
great
confusion
of
men
running
hither
and
thither
and
scrambling
up
and
down
the
rigging
like
monkeys
while
the
captain
and
one
whom
he
had
come
to
know
as
the
captain
mate
were
shouting
out
orders
in
a
strange
foreign
jargon
a
storm
was
indeed
approaching
with
great
rapidity
a
prodigious
circle
of
rain
and
clouds
whirling
overhead
like
smoke
while
the
lightning
every
now
and
then
flashed
with
intense
brightness
followed
by
loud
peals
of
thunder
by
these
flashes
of
lightning
barnaby
observed
that
they
had
made
land
during
the
night
for
in
the
sudden
glare
of
bright
light
he
beheld
a
mountainous
headland
and
a
long
strip
of
sandy
beach
standing
out
against
the
blackness
of
the
night
beyond
so
much
he
was
able
to
distinguish
though
what
coast
it
might
be
he
could
not
tell
for
presently
another
flash
falling
from
the
sky
he
saw
that
the
shore
was
shut
out
by
the
approaching
downfall
of
rain
this
rain
came
presently
streaming
down
upon
them
with
a
great
gust
of
wind
and
a
deal
of
white
foam
across
the
water
this
violent
gale
of
wind
suddenly
striking
the
vessel
careened
it
to
one
side
so
that
for
a
moment
it
was
with
much
ado
that
he
was
able
to
keep
his
feet
at
all
indeed
what
with
the
noise
of
the
tempest
through
the
rigging
and
the
flashes
of
lightning
and
the
pealing
of
the
thunder
and
the
clapping
of
an
unfurled
sail
in
the
darkness
and
the
shouting
of
orders
in
a
strange
language
by
the
captain
of
the
craft
who
was
running
up
and
down
like
a
bedlamite
it
was
like
pandemonium
with
all
the
devils
of
the
pit
broke
loose
into
the
night
it
was
at
this
moment
and
barnaby
true
was
holding
to
the
when
a
sudden
prolonged
flash
of
lightning
came
after
a
continued
space
of
darkness
so
sharp
and
heavy
was
this
shaft
that
for
a
moment
the
night
was
as
bright
as
day
and
in
that
instant
occurred
that
which
was
so
remarkable
that
it
hath
afforded
the
title
of
this
story
itself
for
there
standing
plain
upon
the
deck
and
not
far
from
the
companionway
as
though
he
had
just
come
up
from
below
our
hero
beheld
a
figure
the
face
of
which
he
had
seen
so
imperfectly
once
before
by
the
flash
of
his
own
pistol
in
the
darkness
upon
this
occasion
however
the
whole
figure
was
stamped
out
with
intense
sharpness
against
the
darkness
and
barnaby
beheld
as
clear
as
day
a
great
burly
man
clad
in
a
tawdry
tinsel
coat
with
a
cocked
hat
with
gold
braid
upon
his
head
his
legs
with
petticoat
breeches
and
cased
in
great
leathern
pulled
up
to
his
knees
stood
planted
wide
apart
as
though
to
brace
against
the
slant
of
the
deck
the
face
our
hero
beheld
to
be
as
white
as
dough
with
fishy
eyes
and
a
bony
forehead
on
the
side
of
which
was
a
great
smear
as
of
blood
all
this
as
was
said
stood
out
as
sharp
and
clear
as
daylight
in
that
one
flash
of
lightning
and
then
upon
the
instant
was
gone
again
as
though
swallowed
up
into
the
darkness
while
a
terrible
clap
of
thunder
seemed
to
split
the
very
heavens
overhead
and
a
strong
smell
as
of
brimstone
filled
the
air
around
about
at
the
same
moment
some
voice
cried
out
from
the
darkness
william
brand
by
god
then
the
rain
clapping
down
in
a
deluge
barnaby
leaped
into
the
saloon
pursued
by
he
knew
not
what
thoughts
for
if
that
was
indeed
the
image
of
old
william
brand
that
he
had
seen
once
before
and
now
again
then
the
grave
must
indeed
have
gaped
and
vomited
out
its
dead
into
the
storm
of
wind
and
lightning
for
what
he
beheld
that
moment
he
hath
ever
averred
he
saw
as
clear
as
ever
he
saw
his
hand
before
his
face
this
is
the
last
account
of
which
there
is
any
record
when
the
figure
of
captain
william
brand
was
beheld
by
the
eyes
of
a
living
man
it
must
have
occurred
just
off
the
highlands
below
the
sandy
hook
for
the
next
morning
when
barnaby
true
came
upon
deck
it
was
to
find
the
sun
shining
brightly
and
the
brigantine
riding
upon
an
even
keel
at
anchor
off
staten
island
three
or
four
distance
from
a
small
village
on
the
shore
and
the
town
of
new
york
in
plain
sight
across
the
water
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
he
had
expected
to
see
ix
and
indeed
it
did
seem
vastly
strange
to
lie
there
alongside
staten
island
all
that
day
with
new
york
town
in
plain
sight
across
the
water
and
yet
so
impossible
to
reach
for
whether
he
desired
to
escape
or
no
barnaby
true
could
not
but
observe
that
both
he
and
the
young
lady
were
so
closely
watched
that
they
might
as
well
have
been
prisoners
tied
hand
and
foot
and
laid
in
the
hold
so
far
as
any
hope
of
getting
away
was
concerned
throughout
that
day
there
was
a
vast
deal
of
mysterious
coming
and
going
aboard
the
brigantine
and
in
the
afternoon
a
went
up
to
the
town
carrying
the
captain
of
the
brigantine
and
a
great
load
in
the
stern
covered
over
with
a
tarpaulin
what
was
so
taken
up
to
the
town
barnaby
did
not
then
guess
nor
did
he
for
a
moment
suspect
of
what
vast
importance
it
was
to
be
for
him
about
sundown
the
small
boat
returned
fetching
the
pirate
captain
of
the
brigantine
back
again
coming
aboard
and
finding
barnaby
on
deck
the
other
requested
him
to
come
down
into
the
saloon
for
he
had
a
few
serious
words
to
say
to
him
in
the
saloon
they
found
the
young
lady
sitting
the
broad
light
of
the
evening
shining
in
through
the
skylight
and
making
it
all
pretty
bright
within
the
captain
commanded
barnaby
to
be
seated
whereupon
he
chose
a
place
alongside
the
young
lady
so
soon
as
he
had
composed
himself
the
captain
began
very
seriously
with
a
preface
somewhat
thus
though
you
may
think
me
the
captain
of
this
brigantine
master
barnaby
true
i
am
not
really
so
but
am
under
orders
of
a
superior
whom
i
have
obeyed
in
all
these
things
that
i
have
done
having
said
so
much
as
this
he
continued
his
address
to
say
that
there
was
one
thing
yet
remaining
for
him
to
do
and
that
the
greatest
thing
of
all
he
said
that
this
was
something
that
both
barnaby
and
the
young
lady
were
to
be
called
upon
to
perform
and
he
hoped
that
they
would
do
their
part
willingly
but
that
whether
they
did
it
willingly
or
no
do
it
they
must
for
those
also
were
the
orders
he
had
received
you
may
guess
how
our
hero
was
disturbed
by
this
prologue
he
had
found
the
young
lady
hand
beneath
the
table
and
he
now
held
it
very
closely
in
his
own
but
whatever
might
have
been
his
expectations
as
to
the
final
purport
of
the
communications
the
other
was
about
to
favor
him
with
his
most
extreme
expectations
could
not
have
equalled
that
which
was
demanded
of
him
my
orders
are
these
said
his
interlocutor
continuing
i
am
to
take
you
and
the
young
lady
ashore
and
to
see
that
you
are
married
before
i
quit
you
and
to
that
end
a
very
good
decent
honest
minister
who
lives
ashore
yonder
in
the
village
was
chosen
and
hath
been
spoken
to
and
is
now
no
doubt
waiting
for
you
to
come
that
is
the
last
thing
i
am
set
to
do
so
now
i
will
leave
you
and
her
young
ladyship
alone
together
for
five
minutes
to
talk
it
over
but
be
quick
about
it
for
whether
willing
or
not
this
thing
must
be
done
thereupon
he
incontinently
went
away
as
he
had
promised
leaving
those
two
alone
together
our
hero
like
one
turned
into
stone
and
the
young
lady
her
face
turned
away
as
red
as
fire
as
barnaby
could
easily
distinguish
by
the
fading
light
nor
can
i
tell
what
barnaby
said
to
her
nor
what
words
or
arguments
he
used
for
so
great
was
the
distraction
of
his
mind
and
the
tumult
of
his
emotions
that
he
presently
discovered
that
he
was
repeating
to
her
over
and
over
again
that
god
knew
he
loved
her
and
that
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
all
the
world
for
him
but
her
after
which
containing
himself
sufficiently
to
continue
his
address
he
told
her
that
if
she
would
not
have
it
as
the
man
had
said
and
if
she
were
not
willing
to
marry
him
as
she
was
bidden
to
do
he
would
rather
die
a
thousand
aye
ten
thousand
deaths
than
lend
himself
to
forcing
her
to
do
such
a
thing
as
this
nevertheless
he
told
her
she
must
speak
up
and
tell
him
yes
or
no
and
that
god
knew
he
would
give
all
the
world
if
she
would
say
yes
all
this
and
much
more
he
said
in
such
a
tumult
that
he
was
hardly
aware
of
what
he
was
speaking
and
she
sitting
there
as
though
her
breath
stifled
her
nor
did
he
know
what
she
replied
to
him
only
that
she
would
marry
him
therewith
he
took
her
into
his
arms
and
for
the
first
time
set
his
lips
to
hers
in
such
a
transport
of
ecstasy
that
everything
seemed
to
his
sight
as
though
he
were
about
to
swoon
so
when
the
captain
returned
to
the
saloon
he
found
barnaby
sitting
there
holding
her
hand
she
with
her
face
turned
away
and
he
so
full
of
joy
that
the
promise
of
heaven
could
not
have
made
him
happier
the
belonging
to
the
brigantine
was
ready
and
waiting
alongside
when
they
came
upon
deck
and
immediately
they
descended
to
it
and
took
their
seats
reaching
the
shore
they
landed
and
walked
up
the
village
street
in
the
twilight
she
clinging
to
our
hero
arm
as
though
she
would
faint
away
the
captain
of
the
brigantine
and
two
other
men
aboard
accompanied
them
to
the
minister
house
where
they
found
the
good
man
waiting
for
them
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
warm
evening
and
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
his
own
door
he
immediately
conducted
them
into
the
house
where
his
wife
having
fetched
a
candle
and
two
others
from
the
village
being
present
the
good
pious
man
having
asked
several
questions
as
to
their
names
and
their
age
and
where
they
were
from
and
having
added
his
blessing
the
ceremony
was
performed
and
the
certificate
duly
signed
by
those
present
from
the
village
the
men
who
had
come
ashore
from
the
brigantine
alone
refusing
to
set
their
hands
to
any
paper
the
same
that
had
taken
the
captain
up
to
the
town
was
waiting
for
barnaby
and
the
young
lady
as
they
came
down
to
the
there
the
captain
of
the
brigantine
having
wished
them
godspeed
and
having
shaken
barnaby
very
heartily
by
the
hand
he
helped
to
push
off
the
boat
which
with
the
slant
of
the
wind
presently
sailed
swiftly
away
dropping
the
shore
and
those
strange
beings
and
the
brigantine
in
which
they
sailed
alike
behind
them
into
the
night
they
could
hear
through
the
darkness
the
creaking
of
the
sails
being
hoisted
aboard
of
the
pirate
vessel
nor
did
barnaby
true
ever
set
eyes
upon
it
or
the
crew
again
nor
so
far
as
the
writer
is
informed
did
anybody
else
x
it
was
nigh
midnight
when
they
made
hartright
wharf
at
the
foot
of
beaver
street
there
barnaby
and
the
boatmen
assisted
the
young
lady
ashore
and
our
hero
and
she
walked
up
through
the
now
silent
and
deserted
street
to
hartright
house
you
may
conceive
of
the
wonder
and
amazement
of
our
hero
dear
when
aroused
by
barnaby
continued
knocking
at
the
street
door
and
clad
in
a
and
carrying
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
he
unlocked
and
unbarred
the
door
and
so
saw
who
it
was
had
aroused
him
at
such
an
hour
of
the
night
and
beheld
the
young
and
beautiful
lady
whom
barnaby
had
brought
home
with
him
the
first
thought
of
the
good
man
was
that
the
had
come
into
port
nor
did
barnaby
undeceive
him
as
he
led
the
way
into
the
house
but
waited
until
they
were
all
safe
and
sound
together
before
he
should
unfold
his
strange
and
wonderful
story
this
was
left
for
you
by
two
foreign
sailors
this
afternoon
barnaby
the
good
man
said
as
he
led
the
way
through
the
hall
holding
up
the
candle
at
the
same
time
so
that
barnaby
might
see
an
object
that
stood
against
the
wainscoting
by
the
door
of
the
it
was
with
difficulty
that
our
hero
could
believe
his
eyes
when
he
beheld
one
of
the
that
sir
john
malyoe
had
fetched
with
such
particularity
from
jamaica
he
bade
his
hold
the
light
nigher
and
then
his
mother
having
come
by
this
time
he
flung
back
the
lid
and
displayed
to
the
dazzled
sight
of
all
the
great
treasure
therein
contained
you
are
to
suppose
that
there
was
no
sleep
for
any
of
them
that
night
for
what
with
barnaby
narrative
of
his
adventures
and
what
with
the
thousand
questions
asked
of
him
it
was
broad
daylight
before
he
had
finished
the
half
of
all
that
he
had
to
relate
the
next
day
but
one
brought
the
herself
into
port
with
the
terrible
news
not
only
of
having
been
attacked
at
night
by
pirates
but
also
that
sir
john
malyoe
was
dead
for
whether
it
was
the
sudden
fright
that
overset
him
or
whether
it
was
the
strain
of
passion
that
burst
some
upon
his
brain
it
is
certain
that
when
the
pirates
quitted
the
carrying
with
them
the
young
lady
and
barnaby
and
the
they
left
sir
john
malyoe
lying
in
a
fit
upon
the
floor
frothing
at
the
mouth
and
black
in
the
face
as
though
he
had
been
choked
it
was
in
this
condition
that
he
was
raised
and
taken
to
his
berth
where
the
next
morning
about
two
he
died
without
once
having
opened
his
eyes
or
spoken
a
single
word
as
for
the
villain
no
one
ever
saw
him
afterwards
though
whether
he
jumped
overboard
or
whether
the
pirates
who
so
attacked
the
ship
had
carried
him
away
bodily
who
shall
say
hartright
had
been
extremely
perplexed
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
chest
of
treasure
that
had
been
left
by
those
men
for
barnaby
but
the
news
of
the
death
of
sir
john
malyoe
made
the
matter
very
easy
for
him
to
decide
for
surely
if
that
treasure
did
not
belong
to
barnaby
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
it
belonged
to
his
wife
she
being
sir
john
malyoe
legal
heir
thus
it
was
that
he
satisfied
himself
and
thus
that
great
fortune
in
actual
computation
amounting
to
upward
of
thousand
pounds
fell
to
barnaby
true
the
grandson
of
that
famous
pirate
william
brand
as
for
the
other
case
of
treasure
it
was
never
heard
of
again
nor
could
barnaby
decide
whether
it
was
divided
as
booty
among
the
pirates
or
whether
they
had
carried
it
away
with
them
to
some
strange
and
foreign
land
there
to
share
it
among
themselves
it
is
thus
we
reach
the
conclusion
of
our
history
with
only
this
to
observe
that
whether
that
strange
appearance
of
captain
brand
was
indeed
a
ghostly
and
spiritual
visitation
or
whether
he
was
present
on
those
two
occasions
in
flesh
and
blood
he
was
as
has
been
said
never
heard
of
again
iv
a
true
history
of
the
devil
at
new
hope
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
the
events
about
to
be
narrated
which
the
reader
is
to
be
informed
occurred
between
the
years
and
there
stood
upon
the
high
and
rugged
crest
of
point
or
pig
and
sow
point
as
it
had
come
to
be
called
the
wooden
ruins
of
a
disused
church
known
throughout
those
parts
as
the
old
free
grace
humble
edifice
had
been
erected
by
a
peculiar
religious
sect
calling
themselves
the
free
grace
believers
the
radical
tenet
of
whose
creed
was
a
denial
of
the
existence
of
such
a
place
as
hell
and
an
affirmation
of
the
universal
mercy
of
god
to
the
intent
that
all
souls
should
enjoy
eternal
happiness
in
the
life
to
this
dangerous
heresy
the
free
grace
believers
were
expelled
from
the
massachusetts
colony
and
after
sundry
peregrinations
settled
at
last
in
the
providence
plantations
upon
point
coadjacent
to
the
town
of
new
hope
there
they
built
themselves
a
small
cluster
of
huts
and
a
church
wherein
to
worship
and
there
for
a
while
they
dwelt
earning
a
precarious
livelihood
from
the
ungenerous
soil
upon
which
they
had
established
may
be
supposed
the
presence
of
so
strange
a
people
was
entertained
with
no
great
degree
of
complaisance
by
the
vicinage
and
at
last
an
old
deed
granting
to
captain
isaiah
applebody
was
revived
by
the
heirs
of
that
renowned
whereupon
the
free
grace
believers
were
warned
to
leave
their
bleak
and
rocky
refuge
for
some
other
accordingly
driven
forth
into
the
world
again
they
embarked
in
the
snow
good
companion
of
bristol
for
the
province
of
pennsylvania
and
were
afterwards
heard
of
no
more
in
those
parts
their
vacated
houses
crumbled
away
into
ruins
and
their
church
tottered
to
footnote
a
vessel
at
the
beginning
of
these
events
upon
the
narrative
of
which
the
author
now
invites
the
reader
to
embark
together
with
i
how
the
devil
haunted
the
at
the
period
of
this
narrative
the
settlement
of
new
hope
had
grown
into
a
very
considerable
seaport
town
doing
an
extremely
handsome
trade
with
the
west
indies
in
cornmeal
and
dried
codfish
for
sugar
molasses
and
rum
among
the
more
important
citizens
of
this
now
wealthy
and
elegant
community
the
most
notable
was
colonel
william
belford
a
magnate
at
once
distinguished
and
honored
in
the
civil
and
military
affairs
of
the
colony
this
gentleman
was
an
illegitimate
son
of
the
earl
of
clandennie
by
the
daughter
of
a
surgeon
of
the
regiment
of
scots
and
he
had
inherited
a
very
considerable
fortune
upon
the
death
of
his
father
from
which
he
now
enjoyed
a
comfortable
competency
our
colonel
made
no
little
virtue
of
the
circumstances
of
his
exalted
birth
he
was
wont
to
address
his
father
memory
with
a
sobriety
that
lent
to
the
fact
of
his
illegitimacy
a
portentous
air
of
seriousness
and
he
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
was
the
friend
and
the
confidential
correspondent
of
the
present
earl
of
clandennie
in
his
intercourse
with
the
several
colonial
governors
he
assumed
an
attitude
of
authority
that
only
his
lineage
could
have
supported
him
in
maintaining
and
possessing
a
large
and
commanding
presence
he
bore
himself
with
a
continent
reserve
that
never
failed
to
inspire
with
awe
those
whom
he
saw
fit
to
favor
with
his
conversation
this
noble
and
distinguished
gentleman
possessed
in
a
brother
an
exact
and
perfect
opposite
to
himself
captain
obadiah
belford
was
a
west
indian
an
inhabitant
of
kingston
in
the
island
of
jamaica
he
was
a
cursing
swearing
renegado
from
virtue
an
acknowledged
dealer
in
negro
slaves
and
reputed
to
have
been
a
buccaneer
if
not
an
pirate
such
as
then
infested
those
tropical
latitudes
in
prodigious
numbers
he
was
not
unknown
in
new
hope
which
he
had
visited
upon
several
occasions
for
a
week
or
so
at
a
time
during
each
period
he
lodged
with
his
brother
whose
household
he
scandalized
by
such
freaks
as
smoking
his
pipe
of
tobacco
in
the
parlor
offering
questionable
pleasantries
to
the
female
servants
and
cursing
and
swearing
in
the
hallways
with
a
fecundity
and
an
ingenuity
that
would
have
put
the
most
godless
sailor
about
the
docks
to
the
blush
accordingly
it
may
then
be
supposed
into
what
a
dismay
it
threw
colonel
belford
when
one
fine
day
he
received
a
letter
from
captain
obadiah
in
which
our
west
indian
desperado
informed
his
brother
that
he
proposed
quitting
those
torrid
latitudes
in
which
he
had
lived
for
so
long
a
time
and
that
he
intended
thenceforth
to
make
his
home
in
new
hope
addressing
colonel
belford
as
my
dear
billy
he
called
upon
that
gentleman
to
rejoice
at
this
determination
and
informed
him
that
he
proposed
in
future
to
live
as
decent
a
limb
of
grace
as
ever
broke
loose
from
hell
and
added
that
he
was
going
to
fetch
as
a
present
for
his
niece
belinda
a
dam
pirty
little
black
girl
to
carry
her
to
church
for
her
accordingly
one
fine
morning
in
pursuance
of
this
promise
our
west
indian
suddenly
appeared
at
new
hope
with
a
prodigious
quantity
of
chests
and
and
with
so
vociferous
an
acclamation
that
all
the
town
knew
of
his
arrival
within
a
of
that
event
when
however
he
presented
himself
before
colonel
belford
it
was
to
meet
with
a
welcome
so
frigid
and
an
address
so
reserved
that
a
douche
of
cold
water
could
not
have
quenched
his
verbosity
more
entirely
for
our
great
man
had
no
notion
to
submit
to
the
continued
infliction
of
the
west
indian
presence
accordingly
after
the
first
words
of
greeting
had
passed
he
addressed
captain
obadiah
in
a
strain
somewhat
after
this
fashion
indeed
i
protest
my
dear
brother
obadiah
it
is
with
the
heartiest
regrets
in
the
world
that
i
find
myself
obliged
to
confess
that
i
can
not
offer
you
a
home
with
myself
and
my
family
it
is
not
alone
that
your
manners
displease
me
though
as
an
elder
to
a
younger
i
may
say
to
you
that
we
of
these
more
northern
latitudes
do
not
entertain
the
same
tastes
in
such
particulars
as
doubtless
obtain
in
the
west
indies
but
the
habits
of
my
household
are
of
such
a
nature
that
i
could
not
hope
to
form
them
to
your
liking
i
can
however
offer
as
my
advice
that
you
may
find
lodgings
at
the
blue
lion
tavern
which
doubtless
will
be
of
a
sort
exactly
to
fit
your
inclinations
i
have
made
inquiries
and
i
am
sure
you
will
find
the
very
best
apartments
to
be
obtained
at
that
excellent
hostelry
placed
at
your
disposal
to
this
astounding
address
our
west
indian
could
for
a
moment
make
no
other
immediate
reply
than
to
open
his
eyes
and
to
glare
upon
colonel
belford
so
that
what
with
his
tall
lean
person
his
long
neck
his
stooping
shoulders
and
his
yellow
face
stained
upon
one
side
an
indigo
blue
by
some
premature
explosion
of
gunpowder
what
with
all
this
and
a
prodigious
hooked
beak
of
a
nose
he
exactly
resembled
some
hungry
predatory
bird
of
prey
meditating
a
pounce
upon
an
unsuspecting
victim
at
last
finding
his
voice
and
rapping
the
ferrule
of
his
cane
upon
the
floor
to
emphasize
his
declamation
he
cried
out
what
what
what
is
this
the
way
to
offer
a
welcome
to
a
brother
new
returned
to
your
house
why
who
are
you
am
not
i
your
brother
who
could
buy
you
out
twice
over
and
have
enough
left
to
live
in
velvet
why
why
very
well
then
have
it
your
own
way
but
if
i
do
grind
your
face
into
the
mud
and
roll
you
into
the
dirt
my
name
is
not
obadiah
belford
thereupon
striving
to
say
more
but
finding
no
fit
words
for
the
occasion
he
swung
upon
his
heel
and
incontinently
departed
banging
the
door
behind
him
like
a
clap
of
thunder
and
cursing
and
swearing
so
prodigiously
as
he
strode
away
down
the
street
that
an
infernal
from
the
pit
could
scarcely
have
exceeded
the
fury
of
his
maledictions
however
he
so
far
followed
colonel
belford
advice
that
he
took
up
his
lodgings
at
the
blue
lion
tavern
where
in
a
little
while
he
had
gathered
about
him
a
court
of
all
such
as
chose
to
take
advantage
of
his
extravagant
bounty
indeed
he
poured
out
his
money
with
incredible
profusion
declaring
with
many
ingenious
and
oaths
that
he
could
match
fortunes
with
the
best
two
men
in
new
hope
and
then
have
enough
left
to
buy
up
his
brother
from
his
hair
to
his
he
made
no
secret
of
the
rebuff
he
had
sustained
from
colonel
belford
for
his
grievance
clung
to
him
like
hot
pitch
itching
the
more
he
meddled
with
it
sometimes
his
fury
was
such
that
he
could
scarcely
contain
himself
upon
such
occasions
cursing
and
swearing
like
an
infernal
he
would
call
heaven
to
witness
that
he
would
live
in
new
hope
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
bring
shame
to
his
brother
and
he
would
declare
again
and
again
with
incredible
variety
of
expletives
that
he
would
grind
his
brother
face
into
the
dirt
for
him
illustration
he
would
shout
opprobrious
words
after
the
other
in
the
streets
accordingly
he
set
himself
assiduously
at
work
to
tease
and
torment
the
good
man
with
every
petty
and
malicious
trick
his
malevolence
could
invent
he
would
shout
opprobrious
words
after
the
other
in
the
streets
to
the
entertainment
of
all
who
heard
him
he
would
parade
up
and
down
before
colonel
belford
house
singing
obstreperous
and
unseemly
songs
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
would
even
rattle
the
ferrule
of
his
cane
against
the
palings
of
the
fence
or
throw
a
stone
at
madam
belford
cat
in
the
wantonness
of
his
malice
meantime
he
had
purchased
a
considerable
tract
of
land
embracing
pig
and
sow
point
and
including
the
old
free
grace
here
he
declared
it
was
his
intention
to
erect
a
house
for
himself
that
should
put
his
brother
wooden
shed
to
shame
accordingly
he
presently
began
the
erection
of
that
edifice
so
considerable
in
size
and
occupying
so
commanding
a
situation
that
it
was
the
admiration
of
all
those
parts
and
was
known
to
fame
as
belford
palace
this
magnificent
residence
was
built
entirely
of
brick
and
captain
obadiah
made
it
a
boast
that
the
material
therefor
was
brought
all
the
way
around
from
new
york
in
flats
in
the
erection
of
this
elegant
structure
all
the
carpenters
and
masons
in
the
vicinage
were
employed
so
that
it
grew
up
with
an
amazing
rapidity
meantime
upon
the
site
of
the
building
rum
and
hollands
were
kept
upon
draught
for
all
comers
so
that
the
place
was
made
the
common
resort
and
the
scene
for
the
orgies
of
all
such
of
the
common
people
as
possessed
a
taste
for
strong
waters
many
coming
from
so
far
away
as
newport
to
enjoy
our
captain
prodigality
meantime
he
himself
strutted
about
the
streets
in
his
red
coat
trimmed
with
gilt
braid
his
hat
cocked
upon
one
side
of
his
bony
head
pleasing
himself
with
the
belief
that
he
was
the
object
of
universal
admiration
and
swelling
with
a
vast
and
consummate
as
he
boasted
with
strident
voice
and
extravagant
enunciation
of
the
magnificence
of
the
palace
he
was
building
at
the
same
time
having
as
he
said
shingles
to
spare
he
patched
and
repaired
the
old
free
grace
so
that
its
gray
and
hoary
exterior
while
rejuvenated
as
to
the
roof
and
walls
presented
in
a
little
while
an
appearance
as
of
a
sudden
eruption
of
bright
yellow
shingles
upon
its
aged
hide
nor
would
our
captain
offer
any
other
explanation
for
so
odd
a
freak
of
fancy
than
to
say
that
it
pleased
him
to
do
as
he
chose
with
his
own
at
last
the
great
house
having
been
completed
and
he
himself
having
entered
into
it
and
furnished
it
to
his
satisfaction
our
captain
presently
began
entertaining
his
friends
therein
with
a
profuseness
of
expenditure
and
an
excess
of
extravagance
that
were
the
continued
admiration
of
the
whole
colony
in
more
part
the
guests
whom
captain
obadiah
thus
received
with
so
lavish
an
indulgence
were
officers
or
government
officials
from
the
garrisons
of
newport
or
of
boston
with
whom
by
some
means
or
other
he
had
scraped
an
acquaintance
at
times
these
gay
gentlemen
would
fairly
take
possession
of
the
town
parading
up
and
down
the
street
under
conduct
of
their
host
staring
ladies
out
of
countenance
with
the
utmost
coolness
and
effrontery
and
offering
loud
and
critical
remarks
concerning
all
that
they
beheld
about
them
expressing
their
opinions
with
the
greatest
freedom
and
jocularity
nor
were
the
orgies
at
belford
palace
limited
to
such
extravagances
as
gaming
and
dicing
and
drinking
for
sometimes
the
community
would
be
scandalized
by
the
presence
of
gayly
dressed
and
ladies
who
came
no
one
knew
whence
to
enjoy
the
convivialities
at
the
great
house
on
the
hill
and
concerning
whom
it
pleased
the
respectable
folk
of
new
hope
to
entertain
the
gravest
suspicion
at
first
these
things
raised
such
a
smoke
that
nothing
else
was
to
be
seen
but
other
strange
and
singular
circumstances
began
to
be
spoken
of
at
first
among
the
common
people
and
then
by
others
it
began
to
be
whispered
and
then
to
be
said
that
the
old
free
grace
out
on
the
point
was
haunted
by
the
devil
the
first
information
concerning
this
dreadful
obsession
arose
from
a
fisherman
who
coming
into
the
harbor
of
a
nightfall
after
a
stormy
day
had
as
he
affirmed
beheld
the
old
all
of
a
blaze
of
light
some
time
after
a
tinker
making
a
from
stapleton
by
way
of
the
old
indian
road
had
a
view
of
a
similar
but
a
much
more
remarkable
manifestation
this
time
as
the
itinerant
most
solemnly
declared
the
was
not
only
seen
all
alight
but
a
bell
was
ringing
as
a
signal
somewhere
off
across
the
darkness
of
the
water
where
as
he
protested
there
suddenly
appeared
a
red
star
that
blazing
like
a
meteor
with
a
surpassing
brightness
for
a
few
seconds
was
presently
swallowed
up
into
inky
darkness
again
upon
another
occasion
a
fiddler
returning
home
after
midnight
from
sprowle
neck
seeing
the
church
alight
had
with
a
temerity
inflamed
by
rum
approached
to
a
nearer
distance
whence
lying
in
the
grass
he
had
he
said
at
the
stroke
of
midnight
beheld
a
multitude
of
figures
emerge
from
the
building
crying
most
dolorously
and
then
had
heard
a
voice
as
of
a
lost
spirit
calling
aloud
all
told
whereat
the
light
in
the
church
was
instantly
extinguished
into
an
impenetrable
darkness
it
was
said
that
when
captain
obadiah
himself
was
first
apprised
of
the
suspicions
entertained
of
the
demoniacal
possession
of
the
old
he
had
fixed
upon
his
venturesome
informant
so
threatening
and
ominous
a
gaze
that
the
other
could
move
neither
hand
nor
foot
under
the
malignant
fury
of
his
observation
then
at
last
clearing
his
countenance
of
its
terrors
he
had
burst
into
a
great
loud
laugh
crying
out
well
what
then
why
not
you
must
know
that
the
devil
and
i
have
been
very
good
friends
in
times
past
i
saw
a
deal
of
him
in
the
west
indies
and
i
must
tell
you
that
i
built
up
the
old
again
so
that
he
and
i
could
talk
together
now
and
then
about
old
times
without
having
a
lot
of
dried
yankee
to
listen
to
every
word
we
had
to
say
to
each
other
if
you
must
know
it
was
only
last
night
that
the
ghost
of
jezebel
and
i
danced
a
fandango
together
in
the
graveyard
up
yonder
while
the
devil
himself
sat
on
old
daniel
root
tombstone
and
blew
on
a
dry
dusty
by
way
of
a
flute
and
now
here
he
swore
a
terrific
oath
you
know
the
worst
that
is
to
be
known
with
only
this
to
say
if
ever
a
man
sets
foot
upon
pig
and
sow
point
again
after
nightfall
to
interfere
with
the
devil
sport
and
mine
hell
suffer
for
it
as
sure
as
fire
can
burn
or
brimstone
can
scorch
so
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
these
terrible
words
however
extravagant
were
to
be
sure
in
the
nature
of
a
direct
confirmation
of
the
very
worst
suspicion
that
could
have
been
entertained
concerning
this
dolorous
affair
but
if
any
further
doubt
lingered
as
to
the
significance
of
such
malevolent
rumors
captain
obadiah
himself
soon
put
an
end
to
the
same
the
reverend
josiah
pettibones
was
used
of
a
saturday
to
take
supper
at
colonel
belford
elegant
residence
it
was
upon
such
an
occasion
and
the
reverend
gentleman
and
his
honored
host
were
smoking
a
pipe
of
tobacco
together
in
the
library
when
there
fell
a
loud
and
importunate
knocking
at
the
house
door
and
presently
the
servant
came
ushering
no
less
a
personage
than
captain
obadiah
himself
after
directing
a
most
cunning
mischievous
look
at
his
brother
captain
obadiah
addressed
himself
directly
to
the
reverend
pettibones
folding
his
hands
with
a
most
indescribable
air
of
mock
humility
sir
says
he
reverend
sir
you
see
before
you
a
humble
and
penitent
sinner
who
has
fallen
so
desperately
deep
into
iniquities
that
he
knows
not
whether
even
so
profound
piety
as
yours
can
elevate
him
out
of
the
pit
in
which
he
finds
himself
sir
it
has
got
about
the
town
that
the
devil
has
taken
possession
of
my
old
and
alas
i
have
to
confess
it
is
the
here
our
captain
hung
his
head
down
upon
his
breast
as
though
overwhelmed
with
the
terrible
communication
he
had
made
what
is
this
that
i
hear
cried
the
reverend
gentleman
can
i
believe
my
ears
believe
your
ears
exclaimed
colonel
belford
to
be
sure
you
can
not
believe
your
ears
do
you
not
see
that
this
is
a
preposterous
lie
and
that
he
is
telling
it
to
you
to
tease
and
to
mortify
me
at
this
captain
obadiah
favored
his
brother
with
a
look
of
exaggerated
and
sanctimonious
humility
alas
brother
he
cried
out
for
accusing
me
so
unjustly
fie
upon
you
would
you
check
a
penitent
in
his
confession
but
you
must
know
that
it
is
to
this
gentleman
that
i
address
myself
and
not
to
you
then
directing
his
discourse
once
more
to
the
reverend
pettibones
he
resumed
his
address
thus
sir
you
must
know
that
while
i
was
in
the
west
indies
i
embarked
among
other
things
in
one
of
those
ventures
against
the
spanish
main
of
which
you
may
have
heard
do
you
mean
piracy
asked
the
reverend
pettibones
and
captain
obadiah
nodded
his
head
is
a
lie
cried
colonel
belford
smacking
his
hand
upon
the
table
he
never
possessed
spirit
enough
for
anything
so
dangerous
as
piracy
or
more
mischievous
than
sir
quoth
captain
obadiah
to
the
reverend
gentleman
again
i
say
to
you
i
address
my
confession
well
sir
one
day
we
sighted
a
spanish
caravel
very
rich
ladened
with
a
prodigious
quantity
of
plate
but
were
without
so
much
as
a
capful
of
wind
to
fetch
us
up
with
her
would
says
i
the
devil
my
soul
for
a
bit
of
a
breeze
to
bring
us
alongside
says
a
voice
beside
me
and
alas
that
i
must
confess
it
there
i
saw
a
man
with
a
very
dark
countenance
whom
i
had
never
before
beheld
aboard
of
our
ship
this
says
he
the
breeze
is
yours
is
it
upon
the
pen
says
i
is
blood
says
he
alas
sir
what
was
a
poor
wretch
so
tempted
as
i
to
do
and
did
you
sign
asked
pettibones
all
agog
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
so
strange
a
narration
woe
is
me
sir
that
i
should
have
done
so
quoth
captain
obadiah
rolling
his
eyes
until
little
but
the
whites
of
them
were
to
be
seen
and
did
you
catch
the
spanish
ship
that
we
did
sir
and
stripped
her
as
clean
as
a
whistle
is
all
a
prodigious
lie
cried
colonel
belford
in
a
fury
sir
can
you
sit
so
complacently
and
be
made
a
fool
of
by
so
extravagant
a
fable
indeed
it
is
unbelievable
said
pettibones
at
this
faint
reply
captain
obadiah
burst
out
laughing
then
renewing
his
narrative
indeed
sir
he
declared
you
may
believe
me
or
not
as
you
please
nevertheless
i
may
tell
you
that
having
so
obtained
my
prize
and
having
time
to
think
coolly
over
the
bargain
i
had
made
i
says
to
myself
says
i
belford
obadiah
belford
here
is
a
pretty
pickle
you
are
in
is
time
you
quit
these
parts
and
lived
decent
or
else
you
are
damned
to
all
eternity
and
so
i
came
hither
to
new
hope
reverend
sir
hoping
to
end
my
days
in
quiet
alas
sir
would
you
believe
it
scarce
had
i
finished
my
fine
new
house
up
at
the
point
when
hither
comes
that
evil
being
to
whom
i
had
sold
my
sorrowful
soul
says
he
belford
i
have
a
mind
to
live
in
new
hope
also
says
i
says
he
may
patch
up
the
old
meetinghouse
serve
my
turn
for
a
while
thinks
i
to
myself
can
be
no
harm
in
that
and
so
i
did
as
he
bade
me
and
would
not
you
do
as
much
for
one
who
had
served
you
as
well
alas
your
reverence
there
he
is
now
and
i
can
not
get
rid
of
him
and
is
over
the
whole
town
that
he
has
the
in
possession
tis
an
incredible
story
cried
the
reverend
pettibones
is
a
lie
from
beginning
to
end
cried
the
colonel
and
now
how
shall
i
get
myself
out
of
my
pickle
asked
captain
obadiah
sir
said
pettibones
if
what
you
tell
me
is
true
is
beyond
my
poor
powers
to
aid
you
alas
cried
captain
obadiah
alas
alas
then
indeed
i
damned
and
therewith
flinging
his
arms
into
the
air
as
though
in
the
extremity
of
despair
he
turned
and
incontinently
departed
rushing
forth
out
of
the
house
as
though
stung
by
ten
thousand
furies
it
was
the
most
prodigious
piece
of
gossip
that
ever
fell
in
the
way
of
the
reverend
josiah
and
for
a
fortnight
he
carried
it
with
him
wherever
he
went
was
the
most
unbelievable
tale
i
ever
heard
he
would
cry
and
yet
where
there
is
so
much
smoke
there
must
be
some
fire
as
for
the
poor
wretch
if
ever
i
saw
a
lost
soul
i
beheld
him
standing
before
me
there
in
colonel
belford
library
and
then
he
would
conclude
yes
yes
is
incredible
and
past
all
belief
but
if
it
be
true
in
ever
so
little
a
part
why
then
there
is
justice
in
this
that
the
devil
should
take
possession
of
the
sanctuary
of
that
very
heresy
that
would
not
only
have
denied
him
the
power
that
every
other
christian
belief
assigns
to
him
but
would
have
destroyed
that
infernal
habitation
that
hath
been
his
for
all
eternity
as
for
captain
belford
if
he
desired
privacy
for
himself
upon
pig
and
sow
point
he
had
taken
the
very
best
means
to
prevent
the
curious
from
spying
upon
him
there
after
nightfall
ii
how
the
devil
stole
the
collector
snuffbox
lieutenant
thomas
goodhouse
was
the
collector
of
customs
in
the
town
of
new
hope
he
was
a
character
of
no
little
notoriety
in
those
parts
enjoying
the
reputation
of
being
able
to
consume
more
pineapple
rum
with
less
effect
upon
his
balance
than
any
other
man
in
the
community
he
possessed
the
voice
of
a
stentor
a
short
person
a
face
congested
to
a
violent
carnation
and
red
hair
of
such
a
color
as
to
add
infinitely
to
the
consuming
fire
of
his
countenance
the
custom
office
was
a
little
white
frame
building
with
green
shutters
and
overhanging
the
water
as
though
to
topple
into
the
tide
here
at
any
time
of
the
day
betwixt
the
hours
of
ten
in
the
morning
and
of
five
in
the
afternoon
the
collector
was
to
be
found
at
his
desk
smoking
his
pipe
of
tobacco
the
while
a
thin
phthisical
clerk
bent
with
unrelaxing
assiduity
over
a
multitude
of
and
papers
accumulated
before
him
for
his
post
of
collectorship
of
the
royal
customs
lieutenant
goodhouse
was
especially
indebted
to
the
patronage
of
colonel
belford
the
worthy
collector
had
some
years
before
come
to
that
gentleman
with
a
written
recommendation
from
the
earl
of
clandennie
of
a
very
unusual
sort
it
was
the
lieutenant
to
save
the
life
of
the
honorable
frederick
dunburne
second
son
of
the
earl
a
wild
rakish
undisciplined
youth
much
given
to
such
mischievous
enterprises
as
the
twisting
off
of
the
beating
of
the
watch
and
the
carrying
away
of
tavern
signs
having
been
a
very
famous
swimmer
at
eton
the
honorable
frederick
undertook
while
at
the
cowes
to
swim
a
certain
considerable
distance
for
a
wager
in
the
midst
of
this
enterprise
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
cramp
and
would
inevitably
have
drowned
had
not
the
lieutenant
who
happened
in
a
boat
close
at
hand
leaped
overboard
and
rescued
the
young
gentleman
from
the
watery
grave
in
which
he
was
about
to
be
engulfed
thus
restoring
him
once
more
to
the
arms
of
his
grateful
family
for
this
fortunate
act
of
rescue
the
earl
of
clandennie
presented
to
his
son
preserver
a
gold
snuffbox
filled
with
guineas
and
inscribed
with
the
following
legend
to
lieutenant
thomas
goodhouse
who
under
the
ruling
of
beneficent
providence
was
the
happy
preserver
of
a
beautiful
and
precious
life
of
virtuous
precocity
this
box
is
presented
by
the
father
of
him
whom
he
saved
as
a
grateful
acknowledgment
of
his
services
thomas
monkhouse
dunburne
viscount
of
dunburne
and
earl
of
clandennie
having
thus
satisfied
the
immediate
demands
of
his
gratitude
it
is
very
possible
that
the
earl
of
clandennie
did
not
choose
to
assume
so
great
a
responsibility
as
the
future
of
his
son
preserver
entailed
nevertheless
feeling
that
something
should
be
done
for
him
he
obtained
for
lieutenant
goodhouse
a
passage
to
the
americas
and
wrote
him
a
strong
letter
of
recommendation
to
colonel
belford
that
gentleman
desiring
to
please
the
legitimate
head
of
his
family
used
his
influence
so
successfully
that
the
lieutenant
was
presently
granted
the
position
of
collector
of
customs
in
the
place
of
captain
maull
who
had
lately
deceased
the
lieutenant
somewhat
to
the
surprise
of
his
patrons
filled
his
new
official
position
as
collector
not
only
with
vigor
but
with
a
not
unbecoming
dignity
he
possessed
an
infinite
appreciation
of
the
responsibilities
of
his
office
and
he
was
more
jealous
to
collect
every
farthing
of
the
royal
duties
than
he
would
have
been
had
those
moneys
been
gathered
for
his
own
emolument
under
the
old
collectorship
of
captain
maull
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
a
barraco
of
superfine
hollands
a
bolt
of
silk
cloth
or
a
keg
of
brandy
to
find
its
way
into
the
house
of
some
influential
merchant
or
colonial
dignitary
but
in
no
such
manner
was
lieutenant
goodhouse
derelict
in
his
duties
he
would
have
sacrificed
his
dearest
friendship
or
his
most
precious
attachment
rather
than
fail
in
his
duties
to
the
crown
in
the
intermission
of
his
duties
it
might
please
him
to
relax
into
the
softer
humors
of
conviviality
but
at
ten
in
the
morning
whatever
his
condition
of
sobriety
he
assumed
at
once
all
the
sterner
panoply
of
a
collector
of
the
royal
customs
thus
he
set
his
virtues
against
his
vices
and
struck
an
even
balance
between
them
when
most
unsteady
upon
his
legs
he
most
asserted
his
integrity
declaring
that
not
a
gill
or
a
thread
came
into
his
port
without
paying
its
duty
and
calling
heaven
to
witness
that
it
had
been
his
hand
that
had
saved
the
life
of
a
noble
young
gentleman
thereupon
perhaps
drawing
forth
the
gleaming
token
of
his
prowess
the
gold
snuffbox
from
his
and
holding
it
tight
in
his
brown
and
hairy
fist
he
would
first
offer
his
interlocutor
a
pinch
of
rappee
and
would
then
call
upon
him
to
read
the
inscription
engraved
upon
the
lid
of
the
case
demanding
to
know
whether
it
mattered
a
fig
if
a
man
did
drink
a
drop
too
much
now
and
then
provided
he
collected
every
farthing
of
the
royal
revenues
and
had
been
the
means
of
saving
the
son
of
the
earl
of
clandennie
never
for
an
instant
upon
such
an
occasion
would
he
permit
his
precious
box
to
quit
his
possession
it
was
to
him
an
emblem
of
those
virtues
that
no
one
knew
but
himself
wherefore
the
more
he
misdoubted
his
own
virtuousness
the
more
valuable
did
the
token
of
that
rectitude
become
in
his
eyes
yes
you
may
look
at
it
he
would
say
but
damme
if
you
shall
handle
it
i
would
not
he
would
cry
let
the
devil
himself
take
it
out
of
my
hands
the
talk
concerning
the
impious
possession
of
the
old
free
grace
was
at
its
height
when
the
official
consciousness
of
the
collector
who
was
just
then
laboring
under
his
constitutional
infirmity
became
suddenly
seized
with
an
irrepressible
alarm
he
declared
that
he
smoked
something
worse
than
the
devil
upon
pig
and
sow
point
and
protested
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
captain
obadiah
was
doing
a
bit
of
upon
his
own
account
and
that
dutiable
goods
were
being
smuggled
in
at
night
under
cover
of
these
incredible
stories
he
registered
a
vow
sealing
it
with
the
most
solemn
protestations
and
with
a
multiplicity
of
ingenious
oaths
that
only
a
mind
stimulated
by
the
heat
of
intoxication
could
have
invented
that
he
would
make
it
his
business
upon
the
first
occasion
that
offered
to
go
down
to
pig
and
sow
point
and
to
discover
for
himself
whether
it
was
the
devil
or
smugglers
that
had
taken
possession
of
the
old
free
grace
thereupon
hauling
out
his
precious
snuffbox
and
rapping
upon
the
lid
he
offered
a
pinch
around
then
calling
attention
to
the
inscription
he
demanded
to
know
whether
a
man
who
had
behaved
so
well
upon
that
occasion
had
need
to
be
afraid
of
a
whole
churchful
of
devils
i
would
he
cried
offer
the
devil
a
pinch
as
i
have
offered
it
to
you
then
i
would
bid
him
read
this
and
tell
me
whether
he
dared
to
say
that
black
was
the
white
of
my
eye
nor
were
those
words
a
vain
boast
upon
the
collector
part
for
before
a
week
had
passed
it
being
reported
that
there
had
been
a
renewal
of
manifestations
at
the
old
church
the
collector
finding
nobody
with
sufficient
courage
to
accompany
him
himself
entered
into
a
small
boat
and
rowed
down
alone
to
pig
and
sow
point
to
investigate
for
his
own
satisfaction
those
appearances
that
so
agitated
the
community
it
was
dusk
when
the
collector
departed
upon
that
memorable
and
solitary
expedition
and
it
was
entirely
dark
before
he
had
reached
its
conclusion
he
had
taken
with
him
a
bottle
of
extra
reserve
rum
to
drive
as
he
declared
the
chill
out
of
his
bones
accordingly
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
surprisingly
brief
interval
before
he
found
himself
floating
in
his
boat
under
the
impenetrable
shadow
of
the
rocky
promontory
the
profound
and
infinite
gloom
of
night
overhung
him
with
a
portentous
darkness
melting
only
into
a
liquid
obscurity
as
it
touched
and
dissolved
into
the
stretch
of
waters
across
the
bay
but
above
on
the
high
and
rugged
shoulder
of
the
point
the
collector
with
dulled
and
swimming
vision
beheld
a
row
of
dim
and
lurid
lights
whereupon
collecting
his
faculties
he
opined
that
the
radiance
he
beheld
was
emitted
from
the
windows
of
the
old
free
grace
having
made
fast
his
boat
with
a
drunken
gravity
the
collector
walked
directly
though
with
uncertain
steps
up
the
steep
and
rugged
path
towards
that
mysterious
illumination
now
and
then
he
stumbled
over
the
stones
and
cobbles
that
lay
in
his
way
but
he
never
quite
lost
his
balance
neither
did
he
for
a
moment
remit
his
drunken
gravity
so
with
a
befuddled
and
obstinate
perseverance
he
reached
at
last
to
the
conclusion
of
his
adventure
and
of
his
fate
the
old
was
two
stories
in
height
the
lower
story
having
been
formerly
used
by
the
free
grace
believers
as
a
place
wherein
to
celebrate
certain
obscure
mysteries
appertaining
to
their
belief
the
upper
story
devoted
to
the
more
ordinary
worship
of
their
sunday
meetings
was
reached
by
a
tall
steep
flight
of
steps
that
led
from
the
ground
to
a
covered
porch
which
sheltered
the
doorway
the
collector
paused
only
long
enough
to
observe
that
the
shutters
of
the
lower
story
were
tight
shut
and
barred
and
that
the
dull
and
lurid
light
shone
from
the
windows
above
then
he
directly
mounted
the
steps
with
a
courage
and
a
perfect
assurance
that
can
only
be
entirely
enjoyed
by
one
in
his
peculiar
condition
of
inebriety
he
paused
to
knock
at
the
door
and
it
appeared
to
him
that
his
knuckles
had
hardly
fallen
upon
the
panel
before
the
valve
was
flung
suddenly
open
an
indescribable
and
heavy
odor
fell
upon
him
and
for
the
moment
overpowered
his
senses
and
he
found
himself
standing
face
to
face
with
a
figure
prodigiously
and
portentously
tall
even
at
this
unexpected
apparition
the
collector
lost
possession
of
no
part
of
his
courage
rather
he
stiffened
himself
to
a
more
stubborn
and
obstinate
resolution
steadying
himself
for
his
address
i
know
very
well
quoth
he
who
you
are
you
are
the
divil
i
dare
say
but
damme
if
you
shall
do
business
here
without
paying
your
duties
to
king
george
i
may
drink
a
drop
too
much
he
cried
but
i
collect
my
duties
every
farthing
of
then
drawing
forth
his
snuffbox
he
thrust
it
under
the
nose
of
the
being
to
whom
he
spake
take
a
pinch
and
read
that
he
roared
but
do
handle
it
for
i
would
take
all
hell
to
let
it
out
of
my
hand
the
being
whom
he
addressed
had
stood
for
all
this
while
as
though
bereft
of
speech
and
of
movement
but
at
these
last
words
he
appeared
to
find
his
voice
for
he
gave
forth
a
strident
bellow
of
so
dreadful
and
terrible
a
sort
that
the
collector
brave
as
he
found
himself
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
before
it
the
next
instant
he
was
struck
upon
the
wrist
as
though
by
a
bolt
of
lightning
and
the
snuffbox
describing
a
yellow
circle
against
the
light
of
the
door
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
beyond
ere
he
could
recover
himself
another
blow
smote
him
upon
the
breast
and
he
fell
headlong
from
the
platform
as
through
infinite
space
the
next
day
the
collector
did
not
present
himself
at
the
office
at
his
accustomed
hour
and
the
morning
wore
along
without
his
appearing
at
his
desk
by
noon
serious
alarm
began
to
take
possession
of
the
community
and
about
two
the
tide
being
then
set
out
pretty
strong
tompkins
the
consumptive
clerk
and
two
sailors
from
the
then
lying
at
hoppins
wharf
went
down
in
a
to
learn
if
possible
what
had
befallen
him
they
coasted
along
the
point
for
above
a
before
they
discovered
any
vestige
of
the
missing
collector
then
at
last
they
saw
him
lying
at
a
little
distance
upon
a
cobbled
strip
of
beach
where
judging
from
his
position
and
from
the
way
he
had
composed
himself
to
rest
he
appeared
to
have
been
overcome
by
liquor
at
this
place
tompkins
put
ashore
and
making
the
best
of
his
way
over
the
slippery
stones
exposed
at
low
water
came
at
last
to
where
his
chief
was
lying
the
collector
was
reposing
with
one
arm
over
his
eyes
as
though
to
shelter
them
from
the
sun
but
as
soon
as
tompkins
had
approached
close
enough
to
see
his
countenance
he
uttered
a
great
cry
that
was
like
a
scream
for
by
the
blue
and
livid
lips
parted
at
the
corners
to
show
the
yellow
teeth
from
the
waxy
whiteness
of
the
fat
and
hairy
hands
in
short
from
the
appearance
of
the
whole
figure
he
was
aware
in
an
instant
that
the
collector
was
dead
his
cry
brought
the
two
sailors
running
they
with
the
utmost
coolness
imaginable
turned
the
collector
over
but
discovered
no
marks
of
violence
upon
him
till
of
a
sudden
one
of
them
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
his
neck
was
broke
upon
this
the
other
opined
that
he
had
fallen
among
the
rocks
and
twisted
his
neck
the
two
mariners
then
made
an
investigation
of
his
pockets
the
clerk
standing
by
the
while
paralyzed
with
horror
his
face
the
color
of
dough
his
scalp
creeping
and
his
hands
and
fingers
twitching
as
though
with
the
palsy
for
there
was
something
indescribably
dreadful
in
the
spectacle
of
those
living
hands
searching
into
the
pockets
and
he
would
freely
have
given
a
week
pay
if
he
had
never
embarked
upon
the
expedition
for
the
recovery
of
his
chief
in
the
collector
pockets
they
found
a
twist
of
tobacco
a
red
bandanna
handkerchief
of
violent
color
a
purse
meagrely
filled
with
copper
coins
and
silver
pieces
a
silver
watch
still
ticking
with
a
loud
and
insistent
iteration
a
piece
of
tarred
string
and
a
the
snuffbox
which
the
lieutenant
had
regarded
with
such
prodigious
pride
as
the
one
emblem
of
his
otherwise
dubious
virtue
was
gone
iii
the
strange
adventures
of
a
young
gentleman
of
quality
the
honorable
frederick
dunburne
second
son
of
the
earl
of
clandennie
having
won
some
six
hundred
pounds
at
écarté
at
a
single
sitting
at
pintzennelli
embarked
with
his
two
friends
captain
blessington
and
lord
george
fitzhope
to
conclude
the
night
with
a
round
of
final
dissipation
in
the
more
remote
parts
of
london
accordingly
they
embarked
at
york
stairs
for
the
three
cranes
ripe
for
any
mischief
upon
the
water
the
three
young
gentlemen
amused
themselves
by
shouting
and
singing
pausing
only
now
and
then
to
discharge
a
broadside
of
raillery
at
the
occupants
of
some
other
and
passing
boat
all
went
very
well
for
a
while
some
of
those
in
the
passing
boats
laughing
and
railing
in
return
others
shouting
out
angry
replies
at
last
they
fell
in
with
a
pulling
heavily
up
against
the
stream
and
loaded
with
a
crew
of
sailors
just
come
into
port
in
reply
to
the
challenge
of
our
young
gentlemen
a
man
in
the
stern
of
the
other
boat
who
appeared
to
be
the
captain
of
the
crew
a
fellow
as
dunburne
could
indefinitely
perceive
by
the
dim
light
of
the
lanthorn
and
the
faint
illumination
of
the
misty
possessing
a
great
coarse
red
face
and
a
bullet
head
surmounted
by
a
mildewed
and
mangy
fur
cap
bawled
out
in
reply
that
if
they
would
only
put
their
boat
near
enough
for
a
minute
or
two
he
would
give
them
a
bellyful
of
something
that
would
make
them
quiet
for
the
rest
of
the
night
he
added
that
he
would
ask
for
nothing
better
than
to
have
the
opportunity
of
beating
dunburne
head
to
a
pudding
and
that
he
would
give
a
crown
to
have
the
three
of
them
within
for
a
minute
upon
this
captain
blessington
swore
that
he
should
be
immediately
accommodated
and
therewith
delivered
an
order
to
that
effect
to
the
watermen
these
obeyed
so
promptly
that
almost
before
dunburne
was
aware
of
what
had
happened
the
two
boats
were
side
by
side
with
hardly
a
foot
of
space
between
the
gunwales
dunburne
beheld
one
of
the
watermen
of
his
own
boat
knock
down
one
of
the
crew
of
the
other
with
the
blade
of
an
oar
and
then
he
himself
was
clutched
by
the
collar
in
the
grasp
of
the
man
with
the
fur
cap
him
dunburne
struck
twice
in
the
face
and
in
the
moonlight
he
saw
that
he
had
started
the
blood
to
running
down
from
his
assailant
nose
but
his
blows
produced
no
other
effect
than
to
call
forth
a
volley
of
the
most
horrible
oaths
that
ever
greeted
his
ears
thereupon
the
boats
drifted
so
far
apart
that
our
young
gentleman
was
haled
over
the
gunwale
and
soused
in
the
cold
water
of
the
river
the
next
moment
some
one
struck
him
upon
the
head
with
a
or
a
billet
of
wood
a
blow
so
crushing
that
the
darkness
seemed
to
split
asunder
with
a
prodigious
flaming
of
lights
and
a
myriad
of
circling
stars
which
presently
disappeared
into
the
profound
and
utter
darkness
of
insensibility
how
long
this
swoon
continued
our
young
gentleman
could
never
tell
but
when
he
regained
so
much
of
his
consciousness
as
to
be
aware
of
the
things
about
him
he
beheld
himself
to
be
confined
in
a
room
the
walls
whereof
were
yellow
and
greasy
with
dirt
he
himself
having
been
laid
upon
a
bed
so
foul
and
so
displeasing
to
his
taste
that
he
could
not
but
regret
the
swoon
from
which
he
had
emerged
into
consciousness
looking
down
at
his
person
he
beheld
that
his
clothes
had
all
been
taken
away
from
him
and
that
he
was
now
clad
in
a
shirt
with
only
one
sleeve
and
a
pair
of
breeches
so
tattered
that
they
barely
covered
his
nakedness
while
he
lay
thus
dismally
depressed
by
so
sad
a
pickle
as
that
into
which
he
found
himself
plunged
he
was
strongly
and
painfully
aware
of
an
uproarious
babble
of
loud
and
drunken
voices
and
a
continual
clinking
of
glasses
which
appeared
to
sound
as
from
a
beneath
these
commingled
now
and
then
with
oaths
and
scraps
of
discordant
song
bellowed
out
above
the
hubbub
his
wounded
head
beat
with
tremendous
and
straining
painfulness
as
though
it
would
burst
asunder
and
he
was
possessed
by
a
burning
thirst
that
seemed
to
consume
his
very
vitals
he
called
aloud
and
in
reply
a
fat
woman
came
fetching
him
something
to
drink
in
a
cup
this
he
swallowed
with
avidity
and
thereupon
the
liquor
perhaps
having
been
drugged
he
dropped
off
into
unconsciousness
once
more
when
at
last
he
emerged
for
a
second
time
into
the
light
of
reason
it
was
to
find
himself
aboard
a
brig
the
he
discovered
her
name
to
be
bound
for
baltimore
in
the
americas
and
then
pitching
and
plunging
upon
a
westerly
running
and
before
a
strong
wind
that
drove
the
vessel
with
enormous
velocity
upon
its
course
for
those
remote
and
unknown
countries
for
which
it
was
bound
the
land
was
still
in
sight
both
astern
and
abeam
but
before
him
lay
the
boundless
and
tremendously
infinite
stretch
of
the
ocean
dunburne
found
himself
still
to
be
clad
in
the
shirt
and
tattered
breeches
that
had
adorned
him
in
the
house
of
the
crimp
in
which
he
had
first
awakened
now
however
an
old
tattered
hat
with
only
a
part
of
the
crown
had
been
added
to
his
costume
as
though
to
complete
the
sad
disorder
of
his
appearance
he
discovered
upon
passing
his
hand
over
his
countenance
that
his
beard
and
hair
had
started
a
bristling
growth
and
that
the
lump
on
his
crown
which
was
even
yet
as
big
as
a
walnut
was
still
patched
with
pieces
of
dirty
indeed
had
he
but
known
it
he
presented
as
miserable
an
appearance
as
the
most
miserable
of
those
wretches
who
were
daily
ravished
from
the
slums
and
streets
of
the
great
cities
to
be
shipped
to
the
americas
nor
was
he
a
long
time
in
discovering
that
he
was
now
one
of
the
several
such
indentured
servants
who
upon
the
conclusion
of
their
voyage
were
to
be
sold
for
their
passage
in
the
plantations
of
maryland
having
learned
so
much
of
his
miserable
fate
and
being
now
able
to
make
shift
to
walk
though
with
weak
and
stumbling
steps
our
young
gentleman
lost
no
time
in
seeking
the
captain
to
whom
he
endeavored
to
explain
the
several
accidents
that
had
befallen
him
acknowledging
that
he
was
the
second
son
of
the
earl
of
clandennie
and
declaring
that
if
he
the
captain
would
put
the
back
into
some
english
port
again
his
lordship
would
make
it
well
worth
his
while
to
lose
so
much
time
for
the
sake
of
one
so
dear
as
a
second
son
to
this
address
the
captain
supposing
him
either
to
be
drunk
or
disordered
in
his
mind
made
no
other
reply
than
to
knock
him
incontinently
down
upon
the
deck
bidding
him
return
forward
where
he
belonged
thereafter
poor
dunburne
found
himself
enjoying
the
reputation
of
a
harmless
madman
the
name
of
the
earl
of
rags
was
bestowed
upon
him
and
the
miserable
companions
of
his
wretched
plight
were
never
tired
of
tempting
him
to
recount
his
adventures
for
the
sake
of
entertaining
themselves
by
teasing
that
which
they
supposed
to
be
his
hapless
mania
nor
is
it
easy
to
conceive
of
all
the
torments
that
those
miserable
obscene
wretches
were
able
to
inflict
upon
him
under
the
teasing
sting
of
his
companions
malevolent
pleasantries
there
were
times
when
dunburne
might
as
he
confessed
to
himself
have
committed
a
murder
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
the
world
however
he
was
endowed
with
no
small
command
of
so
that
he
was
still
able
to
curb
his
passions
within
the
bounds
of
reason
and
of
policy
he
was
fortunately
a
complete
master
of
the
french
and
italian
languages
so
that
when
the
fury
of
his
irritation
would
become
too
excessive
for
him
to
control
he
would
ease
his
spirits
by
castigating
his
tormentors
with
a
consuming
verbosity
in
those
foreign
tongues
which
had
his
companions
understood
a
single
word
of
that
which
he
uttered
would
have
earned
for
him
a
beating
that
would
have
landed
him
within
an
inch
of
his
life
however
they
attributed
all
that
he
said
to
the
irrational
gibbering
of
a
maniac
about
midway
of
their
voyage
the
encountered
a
tremendous
storm
which
drove
her
so
far
out
of
the
captain
reckoning
that
when
land
was
sighted
in
the
afternoon
of
a
tempestuous
day
in
the
latter
part
of
august
the
first
mate
who
had
been
for
some
years
in
the
new
england
trade
opined
that
it
was
the
coast
of
rhode
island
and
that
if
the
captain
chose
to
do
so
he
might
run
into
new
hope
harbor
and
lie
there
until
the
southeaster
had
blown
itself
out
this
advice
the
captain
immediately
put
into
execution
so
that
by
nightfall
they
had
dropped
anchor
in
the
comparative
quiet
of
that
excellent
harbor
dunburne
was
a
most
excellent
and
practised
swimmer
that
evening
when
the
dusk
had
pretty
well
fallen
he
jumped
overboard
dived
under
the
brig
and
came
up
on
the
other
side
thus
leaving
all
hands
aboard
looking
for
him
or
for
his
dead
body
at
the
starboard
side
of
the
he
himself
swam
slowly
away
to
the
larboard
now
partly
under
water
now
floating
on
his
back
he
directed
his
course
towards
a
point
of
land
about
a
mile
away
whereon
as
he
had
observed
before
the
dark
had
settled
down
there
stood
an
old
wooden
building
resembling
a
church
and
a
great
brick
house
with
tall
lean
chimneys
at
a
little
farther
distance
inland
the
intemperate
cold
of
the
water
of
those
parts
of
america
was
so
much
more
excessive
than
dunburne
had
been
used
to
swim
in
that
when
he
dragged
himself
out
upon
the
rocky
beach
he
lay
for
a
considerable
time
more
dead
than
alive
his
limbs
appeared
to
possess
hardly
any
vitality
so
benumbed
were
they
by
the
icy
chill
that
had
entered
into
the
very
marrow
of
his
bones
nor
did
he
for
a
long
while
recover
from
this
excessive
rigor
his
limbs
still
continued
at
intervals
to
twitch
and
shudder
as
with
a
convulsion
nor
could
he
at
such
times
at
all
control
their
trembling
at
last
however
with
a
huge
sigh
he
aroused
himself
to
some
perception
of
his
surroundings
which
he
acknowledged
were
of
as
dispiriting
a
sort
as
he
could
well
have
conceived
of
his
recovering
senses
were
distracted
by
a
ceaseless
watery
din
for
the
breaking
waves
rushing
with
a
prodigious
swiftness
from
the
harbor
to
the
shore
before
the
driving
wind
fell
with
uproarious
crashing
into
white
foam
among
the
rocks
above
this
watery
tumult
spread
the
wet
gloom
of
the
night
full
of
the
blackness
and
pelting
chill
of
a
fine
slanting
rain
through
this
shroud
of
mist
and
gloom
dunburne
at
last
distinguished
a
faint
light
blurred
by
the
sheets
of
rain
and
darkness
and
shining
as
though
from
a
considerable
distance
cheered
by
this
nearer
presence
of
human
life
our
young
gentleman
presently
gathered
his
benumbed
powers
together
arose
and
after
a
while
began
slowly
and
feebly
to
climb
a
stony
hill
that
lay
between
the
rocky
beach
and
that
faint
but
encouraging
illumination
so
sorely
buffeted
by
the
tempest
he
at
last
reached
the
black
square
form
of
that
structure
from
which
the
light
shone
the
building
he
perceived
to
be
a
little
wooden
church
of
two
stories
in
height
the
shutters
of
the
lower
story
were
tight
fastened
as
though
bolted
from
within
those
above
were
open
and
from
them
issued
the
light
that
had
guided
him
in
his
approach
from
the
beach
a
tall
flight
of
wooden
steps
wet
in
the
rain
reached
to
a
small
enclosed
porch
or
vestibule
whence
a
door
now
tight
shut
gave
ingress
into
the
second
story
of
the
church
thence
as
dunburne
stood
without
he
could
now
distinguish
the
dull
muttering
of
a
man
voice
which
he
opined
might
be
that
of
the
preacher
our
young
gentleman
as
may
be
supposed
was
in
a
wretched
plight
he
was
ragged
and
unshaven
his
only
clothing
was
the
miserable
shirt
and
bepatched
breeches
that
had
served
him
as
shelter
throughout
the
long
voyage
these
abominable
garments
were
now
wet
to
the
skin
and
so
displeasing
was
his
appearance
that
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
did
not
possess
enough
of
humility
to
avow
so
great
a
misery
to
the
light
and
to
the
eyes
of
strangers
accordingly
finding
some
shelter
afforded
by
the
vestibule
of
the
church
he
crouched
there
in
a
corner
huddling
his
rags
about
him
and
finding
a
certain
poor
warmth
in
thus
hiding
away
from
the
buffeting
of
the
chill
and
penetrating
wind
as
he
so
crouched
he
presently
became
aware
of
the
sound
of
many
voices
dull
and
groaning
coming
from
within
the
edifice
and
then
now
and
again
the
clanking
as
of
a
multitude
of
chains
then
of
a
sudden
and
unexpectedly
the
door
near
him
was
flung
wide
open
and
a
faint
glow
of
reddish
light
fell
across
the
passage
instantly
the
figure
of
a
man
came
forth
and
following
him
came
not
a
congregation
as
dunburne
might
have
supposed
but
a
most
dolorous
company
of
nearly
or
quite
naked
men
and
women
outlined
blackly
as
they
emerged
against
the
dull
illumination
from
behind
these
wretched
beings
sighing
and
groaning
most
piteously
with
a
monotonous
wailing
of
many
voices
were
chained
by
the
wrist
two
and
two
together
and
as
they
passed
by
close
to
dunburne
his
nostrils
were
overpowered
by
a
heavy
and
fetid
odor
that
came
partly
from
within
the
building
partly
from
the
wretched
creatures
that
passed
him
by
as
the
last
of
these
miserable
beings
came
forth
from
the
bowels
of
that
dreadful
place
a
loud
voice
so
near
to
dunburne
as
to
startle
his
ears
with
its
sudden
exclamation
cried
out
all
told
and
thereat
instantly
the
dull
light
from
within
was
quenched
into
darkness
in
the
gloom
and
the
silence
that
followed
dunburne
could
hear
for
a
while
nothing
but
the
dash
of
the
rain
upon
the
roof
and
the
ceaseless
drip
and
trickle
of
the
water
running
from
the
eaves
into
the
puddles
beneath
the
building
then
as
he
stood
still
marvelling
at
what
he
had
seen
there
suddenly
came
a
loud
and
startling
crash
as
of
a
let
fall
into
its
place
a
faint
circle
of
light
shone
within
the
darkness
of
the
building
as
though
from
a
lantern
carried
in
a
man
hands
there
was
a
sound
of
jingling
as
of
keys
of
approaching
footsteps
and
of
voices
talking
together
and
presently
there
came
out
into
the
vestibule
the
dark
figures
of
two
men
one
of
them
carrying
a
lantern
one
of
these
figures
closed
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
then
both
were
about
to
turn
away
without
having
observed
dunburne
when
of
a
sudden
a
circle
from
the
roof
of
the
lantern
lit
up
his
pale
and
melancholy
face
and
he
instantly
became
aware
that
his
presence
had
been
discovered
the
next
moment
the
lantern
was
flung
up
almost
into
his
eyes
and
in
the
light
he
saw
the
sharp
round
rim
of
a
directed
immediately
against
his
forehead
in
that
moment
our
young
gentleman
life
hung
as
a
hair
in
the
balance
in
the
intense
instant
of
expectancy
his
brain
appeared
to
expand
as
a
bubble
and
his
ears
tingled
and
hummed
as
though
a
cloud
of
flies
were
buzzing
therein
then
suddenly
a
voice
smote
like
a
blow
upon
the
silence
who
are
you
and
what
d
want
indeed
said
dunburne
i
do
not
know
what
do
you
do
here
nor
do
i
know
that
either
he
who
held
the
lantern
lifted
it
so
that
the
illumination
fell
still
more
fully
upon
dunburne
face
and
person
then
his
interlocutor
demanded
how
did
you
come
here
upon
the
moment
dunburne
determined
to
answer
so
much
of
the
truth
as
the
question
required
was
by
no
fault
of
my
own
he
cried
i
was
knocked
on
the
head
and
kidnapped
in
england
with
the
design
of
being
sold
in
baltimore
the
vessel
that
fetched
me
put
into
the
harbor
over
yonder
to
wait
for
good
weather
and
i
jumped
overboard
and
swam
ashore
to
stumble
into
the
cursed
pickle
in
which
i
now
find
myself
have
you
then
an
education
to
be
sure
you
talk
so
indeed
i
have
said
dunburne
a
decent
enough
education
to
fit
me
for
a
gentleman
if
the
opportunity
offered
but
what
of
that
he
exclaimed
desperately
i
might
as
well
have
no
more
learning
than
a
beggar
under
the
bush
for
all
the
good
it
does
me
the
other
once
more
flashed
the
light
of
his
lantern
over
our
young
miserable
and
barefoot
figure
i
had
a
mind
says
he
to
blow
your
brains
out
against
the
wall
i
have
a
notion
now
however
to
turn
you
to
some
use
instead
so
i
just
spare
your
life
for
a
little
while
till
i
see
how
you
behave
he
spoke
with
so
much
more
of
jocularity
than
he
had
heretofore
used
that
dunburne
recovered
in
great
part
his
dawning
assurance
i
am
infinitely
obliged
to
you
he
cried
for
sparing
my
brains
but
i
protest
i
doubt
if
you
will
ever
find
so
good
an
opportunity
again
to
murder
me
as
you
have
just
enjoyed
this
speech
seemed
to
tickle
the
other
prodigiously
for
he
burst
into
a
loud
and
boisterous
laugh
under
cover
of
which
he
thrust
his
pistol
back
into
his
again
come
with
me
and
i
fit
you
with
victuals
and
decent
clothes
of
both
of
which
you
appear
to
stand
in
no
little
need
he
said
thereupon
and
without
another
word
he
turned
and
quitted
the
place
accompanied
by
his
companion
who
for
all
this
time
had
uttered
not
a
single
sound
a
little
way
from
the
church
these
two
parted
company
with
only
a
brief
word
spoken
between
them
dunburne
interlocutor
with
our
young
gentleman
following
close
behind
him
led
the
way
in
silence
for
a
considerable
distance
through
the
long
wet
grass
and
the
tempestuous
darkness
until
at
last
still
in
unbroken
silence
they
reached
the
confines
of
an
enclosure
and
presently
stood
before
a
large
and
imposing
house
built
of
brick
dunburne
mysterious
guide
still
carrying
the
lantern
conducted
him
directly
up
a
broad
flight
of
steps
and
opening
the
door
ushered
him
into
a
hallway
of
no
inconsiderable
pretensions
thence
he
led
the
way
to
a
beyond
where
our
young
gentleman
observed
a
long
mahogany
table
and
a
sideboard
of
carved
mahogany
illuminated
by
three
or
four
candles
in
answer
to
the
call
of
his
conductor
a
negro
servant
appeared
whom
the
master
of
the
house
ordered
to
fetch
some
bread
and
cheese
and
a
bottle
of
rum
for
his
wretched
guest
while
the
servant
was
gone
to
execute
the
commission
the
master
seated
himself
at
his
ease
and
favored
dunburne
with
a
long
and
most
minute
regard
then
he
suddenly
asked
our
young
gentleman
what
was
his
name
upon
the
instant
dunburne
did
not
offer
a
reply
to
this
interrogation
he
had
been
so
miserably
abused
when
he
had
told
the
truth
upon
the
voyage
that
he
knew
not
now
whether
to
confess
or
deny
his
identity
he
possessed
no
great
aptitude
at
lying
so
that
it
was
with
no
little
hesitation
that
he
determined
to
maintain
his
incognito
having
reached
this
conclusion
he
answered
his
host
that
his
name
was
tom
robinson
the
other
however
appeared
to
notice
neither
his
hesitation
nor
the
name
which
he
had
seen
fit
to
assume
instead
he
appeared
to
be
lost
in
a
reverie
which
he
broke
only
to
bid
our
young
gentleman
to
sit
down
and
tell
the
story
of
the
several
adventures
that
had
befallen
him
he
advised
him
to
leave
nothing
untold
however
shameful
it
might
be
be
assured
said
he
that
no
matter
what
crimes
you
may
have
committed
the
more
intolerable
your
wickedness
the
better
you
will
please
me
for
the
purpose
i
have
in
view
being
thus
encouraged
and
having
already
embarked
in
disingenuosity
our
young
gentleman
desiring
to
please
his
host
began
at
random
a
tale
composed
in
great
part
of
what
he
recollected
of
the
story
of
seasoned
occasionally
with
extracts
from
ingenious
novel
of
count
there
was
hardly
a
petty
crime
or
a
mean
action
mentioned
in
either
of
these
entertaining
fictions
that
he
was
not
willing
to
attribute
to
himself
meanwhile
he
discovered
to
his
surprise
that
lying
was
not
really
so
difficult
an
art
as
he
had
supposed
it
to
be
his
host
listened
for
a
considerable
while
in
silence
but
at
last
he
was
obliged
to
call
upon
his
penitent
to
stop
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
cried
i
do
not
believe
a
single
word
you
are
telling
me
however
i
am
satisfied
that
in
you
i
have
discovered
as
i
have
every
reason
to
hope
one
of
the
most
preposterous
liars
i
have
for
a
long
time
fell
in
with
indeed
i
protest
that
any
one
who
can
with
so
steady
a
countenance
lie
so
tremendously
as
you
have
just
done
may
be
capable
if
not
of
a
great
crime
at
least
of
no
inconsiderable
deceit
and
perhaps
of
treachery
if
this
be
so
you
will
suit
my
purposes
very
well
though
i
would
rather
have
had
you
an
escaped
criminal
or
a
murderer
or
a
thief
sir
said
dunburne
very
seriously
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
not
more
to
your
mind
as
you
say
i
can
i
find
lie
very
easily
and
if
you
will
give
me
sufficient
time
i
dare
say
i
can
become
sufficiently
expert
in
other
and
more
criminal
matters
to
please
even
your
fancy
i
can
not
i
fear
commit
a
murder
nor
would
i
choose
to
embark
upon
an
attempt
at
arson
but
i
could
easily
learn
to
cheat
at
cards
or
i
could
if
it
would
please
you
better
make
shift
to
forge
your
own
name
to
a
bill
for
a
hundred
pounds
i
confess
however
i
am
entirely
in
the
dark
as
to
why
you
choose
to
have
me
enjoy
so
evil
a
reputation
at
these
words
the
other
burst
into
a
great
and
vociferous
laugh
i
protest
he
cried
you
are
the
coolest
rascal
ever
i
fell
in
with
but
come
he
added
sobering
suddenly
what
did
you
say
was
your
name
i
declare
sir
said
dunburne
with
the
most
ingenuous
frankness
i
have
clean
forgot
was
it
tom
or
john
robinson
again
the
other
burst
out
laughing
well
he
said
what
does
it
matter
thomas
or
john
is
all
one
i
see
that
you
are
a
ragged
lousy
beggar
and
i
believe
you
to
be
a
runaway
servant
even
if
that
is
the
worst
to
be
said
of
you
you
will
suit
me
very
well
as
for
a
name
i
myself
will
fit
you
with
one
and
it
shall
be
of
the
best
i
will
give
you
a
home
here
in
the
house
and
will
for
three
months
clothe
you
like
a
lord

shall
live
upon
the
best
and
shall
meet
plenty
of
the
genteelest
company
the
colonies

afford
all
that
i
demand
of
you
is
that
you
shall
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
for
the
three
months
that
i
so
entertain
you
come
is
it
a
bargain
dunburne
sat
for
a
while
thinking
very
seriously
first
of
all
said
he
i
must
know
what
is
the
name
you
have
a
mind
to
bestow
upon
me
the
other
looked
distrustfully
at
him
for
a
time
and
then
as
though
suddenly
fetching
up
resolution
he
cried
out
well
what
then
what
of
it
why
should
i
be
afraid
i
tell
you
your
name
shall
be
frederick
dunburne
and
you
shall
be
the
second
son
of
the
earl
of
clandennie
had
a
fallen
from
heaven
at
dunburne
feet
he
could
not
have
been
struck
more
entirely
dumb
than
he
was
at
those
astounding
words
he
knew
not
for
the
moment
where
to
look
or
what
to
think
at
that
instant
the
negro
man
came
into
the
room
fetching
the
bottle
of
rum
and
the
bread
and
cheese
he
had
been
sent
for
as
the
sound
of
his
entrance
struck
upon
our
young
gentleman
senses
he
came
to
himself
with
the
shock
and
suddenly
exploded
into
a
burst
of
laughter
so
shrill
and
discordant
that
captain
obadiah
sat
staring
at
him
as
though
he
believed
his
ragged
beneficiary
had
gone
clean
out
of
his
senses
iv
a
romantic
episode
in
the
life
of
a
young
lady
miss
belinda
belford
the
daughter
and
only
child
of
colonel
william
belford
was
a
young
lady
possessed
of
no
small
pretensions
to
personal
charms
of
the
most
exalted
order
indeed
many
excellent
judges
in
such
matters
regarded
her
without
doubt
as
the
reigning
belle
of
the
northern
colonies
of
a
medium
height
of
a
slight
but
generously
rounded
figure
she
bore
herself
with
an
indescribable
grace
and
dignity
of
carriage
her
hair
which
was
occasionally
permitted
to
curl
in
ringlets
upon
her
snowy
neck
was
of
a
brown
so
dark
and
so
soft
as
at
times
to
deceive
the
admiring
observer
into
a
belief
that
it
was
black
her
eyes
likewise
of
a
color
were
of
a
most
melting
and
liquid
lustre
her
nose
though
slight
was
sufficiently
high
and
modelled
with
so
exquisite
a
delicacy
as
to
lend
an
exceeding
charm
to
her
whole
countenance
she
was
easily
the
belle
of
every
assembly
which
she
graced
with
her
presence
and
her
name
was
the
toast
of
every
garrison
town
of
the
northern
provinces
madam
belford
and
her
lovely
daughter
were
engaged
one
pleasant
morning
in
entertaining
a
number
of
friends
in
the
genteel
english
manner
with
a
dish
of
tea
and
a
bit
of
gossip
upon
this
charming
company
colonel
belford
suddenly
intruded
his
countenance
displaying
an
excessive
though
not
displeasing
agitation
my
dear
my
dear
he
cried
what
a
piece
of
news
have
i
for
you
it
is
incredible
and
past
all
belief
who
ladies
do
you
suppose
is
here
in
new
hope
nay
you
can
not
guess
i
shall
have
to
enlighten
you
is
none
other
than
frederick
dunburne
my
lordship
second
son
yes
you
may
well
look
amazed
i
saw
and
spoke
with
him
this
very
morning
and
that
not
above
a
ago
he
is
travelling
incognito
but
my
brother
obadiah
discovered
his
identity
and
is
now
entertaining
him
at
his
new
house
upon
the
point
a
large
party
of
young
officers
from
the
garrison
are
there
all
very
gay
with
cards
and
dice
i
am
told
my
noble
young
gentleman
knew
me
so
soon
as
he
clapped
eyes
upon
me
says
he
i
am
not
mistook
must
be
colonel
belford
my
father
honored
friend
he
is
exclaimed
the
speaker
a
most
interesting
and
ingenuous
youth
with
extremely
lively
and
elegant
manners
and
a
person
exactly
resembling
that
of
his
dear
and
honored
father
it
may
be
supposed
into
what
a
flutter
this
piece
of
news
cast
those
who
heard
it
my
dear
cried
madam
belford
as
soon
as
the
first
extravagance
of
the
general
surprise
had
passed
by
to
an
easier
acceptance
of
colonel
belford
tidings
my
dear
why
did
you
not
bring
him
with
you
to
present
him
to
us
all
what
an
opportunity
have
you
lost
indeed
my
dear
said
colonel
belford
i
did
not
forget
to
invite
him
hither
he
protested
that
nothing
could
afford
him
greater
pleasure
did
he
not
have
an
engagement
with
some
young
gentlemen
from
the
garrison
but
believe
me
i
would
not
let
him
go
without
a
promise
he
is
to
dine
with
us
at
two
and
belinda
my
dear
here
colonel
belford
pinched
his
daughter
blushing
cheek
you
must
assume
your
best
appearance
for
so
serious
an
occasion
i
am
informed
that
my
noble
gentleman
is
extremely
particular
in
his
tastes
in
the
matter
of
female
excellence
indeed
papa
cried
the
young
lady
with
great
vivacity
i
shall
attempt
no
extraordinary
graces
upon
my
young
gentleman
account
and
that
i
promise
you
i
protest
she
exclaimed
with
spirit
i
have
no
great
opinion
of
him
who
would
come
thus
to
new
hope
without
a
single
word
to
you
who
are
his
father
confidential
correspondent
nor
do
i
admire
the
taste
of
one
who
would
choose
to
cast
himself
upon
the
hospitality
of
my
uncle
obadiah
rather
than
upon
yours
my
dear
said
colonel
belford
very
soberly
you
express
your
opinion
with
a
most
unwarranted
levity
considering
the
exalted
position
your
subject
occupies
i
may
however
explain
to
you
that
he
came
to
america
quite
unexpectedly
and
by
an
accident
nor
would
he
have
declared
his
incognito
had
not
my
brother
obadiah
discovered
it
almost
immediately
upon
his
arrival
he
would
not
he
declared
have
visited
new
hope
at
all
had
not
captain
obadiah
belford
urged
his
hospitality
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preclude
all
denial
but
to
this
reproof
miss
belinda
who
was
indeed
greatly
indulged
by
her
parents
made
no
other
reply
than
to
toss
her
head
with
a
pretty
sauciness
and
to
pout
her
cherry
lips
in
an
infinitely
becoming
manner
but
though
our
young
lady
protested
so
emphatically
against
assuming
any
unusual
charms
for
the
entertainment
of
their
expected
visitor
she
none
the
less
devoted
no
small
consideration
to
that
very
thing
that
she
had
so
exclaimed
against
accordingly
when
she
was
presented
to
her
father
noble
guest
what
with
her
heightened
color
and
her
eyes
sparkling
with
the
emotions
evoked
by
the
occasion
she
so
impressed
our
young
gentleman
that
he
could
do
little
but
stand
regarding
her
with
an
astonishment
that
for
the
moment
caused
him
to
forget
those
graces
of
deportment
that
the
demands
of
elegance
called
upon
him
to
assume
however
he
recovered
himself
immediately
and
proceeded
to
take
such
advantage
of
his
introduction
that
by
the
time
they
were
seated
at
the
he
found
himself
conversing
with
his
fair
partner
with
all
the
ease
and
vivacity
imaginable
nor
in
this
exchange
of
polite
raillery
did
he
discover
her
wit
to
be
in
any
degree
less
than
her
personal
charms
indeed
madam
he
exclaimed
i
am
now
more
than
ready
to
thank
that
happy
accident
that
has
transported
me
however
much
against
my
will
from
england
to
america
the
scenery
how
beautiful
nature
how
fertile
woman
how
exquisite
your
country
he
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
is
like
heaven
indeed
sir
cried
the
young
lady
vivaciously
i
do
not
take
your
praise
for
a
compliment
i
protest
i
am
acquainted
with
no
young
gentleman
who
would
not
defer
his
enjoyment
of
heaven
to
the
very
last
extremity
to
be
sure
quoth
our
hero
an
ambition
for
the
abode
of
saints
is
of
too
extreme
a
nature
to
recommend
itself
to
a
modest
young
fellow
of
parts
but
when
one
finds
himself
thrown
into
the
society
of
an
houri
and
do
you
indeed
have
houris
in
england
exclaimed
the
young
lady
in
america
you
must
be
content
with
society
of
a
much
more
earthly
constitution
upon
my
word
miss
cried
our
young
gentleman
you
compel
me
to
confess
that
i
find
myself
in
the
society
of
one
vastly
more
to
my
inclination
than
that
of
any
houri
of
my
acquaintance
with
such
lively
badinage
occasionally
lapsing
into
more
serious
discourse
the
dinner
passed
off
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasantness
to
our
young
gentleman
who
had
prepared
himself
for
something
prodigiously
dull
and
heavy
after
the
repast
a
pipe
of
tobacco
in
the
and
a
walk
in
the
garden
so
far
completed
his
cheerful
impressions
that
when
he
rode
away
towards
pig
and
sow
point
he
found
himself
accompanied
by
the
most
lively
agreeable
thoughts
imaginable
her
wit
how
subtle
her
person
how
beautiful
he
surprised
himself
smiling
with
a
fatuous
indulgence
of
his
enjoyable
fancies
nor
did
the
young
lady
thoughts
though
doubtless
of
a
more
moderate
sort
assume
a
less
pleasing
perspective
our
young
gentleman
was
favored
with
a
tall
erect
figure
a
high
nose
and
a
fine
thin
face
expressive
of
excellent
breeding
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
manners
possessed
an
elegance
and
a
grace
that
she
had
never
before
discovered
beyond
the
leaves
of
richardson
ingenious
novels
nor
was
she
unaware
of
the
admiration
of
herself
that
his
countenance
had
expressed
upon
so
slender
a
foundation
she
amused
herself
for
above
an
hour
erecting
such
castles
in
the
air
that
had
any
one
discovered
her
thought
she
would
have
perished
of
mortification
but
though
our
young
lady
so
yielded
herself
to
the
enjoyment
of
such
silly
dreams
as
might
occur
to
any
miss
of
a
lively
imagination
and
vivacious
temperament
the
reader
is
to
understand
that
she
has
yet
so
much
dignity
and
spirit
as
to
cover
these
foolish
and
romantic
fancies
with
a
cloak
of
so
delicate
and
so
subtle
a
reserve
that
when
the
young
gentleman
called
to
pay
his
respects
the
next
afternoon
he
quitted
her
presence
ten
times
more
infatuated
with
her
charms
than
he
had
been
the
day
before
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
our
young
lady
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
make
the
greatest
use
of
such
opportunities
she
already
possessed
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
teasing
the
other
sex
with
those
delicious
though
innocent
torments
that
cause
the
eyes
of
the
victim
to
remain
awake
at
night
and
the
fancy
to
dream
throughout
the
day
such
presently
became
the
condition
of
our
young
gentleman
that
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
knew
not
whether
his
present
life
had
continued
for
weeks
or
for
years
in
the
charming
infatuation
that
overpowered
him
he
considered
nothing
of
time
every
other
consideration
being
engulfed
in
his
desire
for
the
society
of
his
charmer
cards
and
dice
lost
for
him
their
accustomed
pleasure
and
when
a
gay
society
would
be
at
palace
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
he
assumed
so
much
patience
as
to
take
his
part
in
those
dissipations
that
there
obtained
relieved
from
them
he
flew
with
redoubled
ardor
back
to
the
gratification
of
his
passion
again
in
the
mean
time
captain
obadiah
had
become
so
accustomed
to
the
presence
of
his
guest
that
he
made
no
pretence
of
any
concealment
of
that
iniquitous
dreadful
avocation
that
lent
to
pig
and
sow
point
so
great
a
terror
in
those
parts
rather
did
the
west
indian
appear
to
court
the
open
observation
of
his
dependant
one
exquisite
day
in
the
last
of
october
our
young
gentleman
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
in
the
society
of
the
beautiful
object
of
his
regard
the
leaves
though
fallen
from
the
trees
in
great
abundance
appeared
thereby
only
to
have
admitted
of
the
passage
of
a
riper
radiance
of
golden
sunlight
through
the
thinning
branches
this
and
the
ardor
of
his
passion
had
so
transported
our
hero
that
when
he
had
departed
from
her
presence
he
seemed
to
walk
as
light
as
a
feather
and
knew
not
whether
it
was
the
warmth
of
the
sunlight
or
the
heat
of
his
own
impetuous
transports
that
filled
the
universe
with
so
extreme
a
brightness
overpowered
with
these
absorbing
and
transcendent
introspections
he
approached
his
now
odious
home
upon
pig
and
sow
point
by
way
of
the
old
there
of
a
sudden
he
came
upon
his
patron
captain
obadiah
superintending
the
burial
of
the
last
of
three
victims
of
his
odious
commerce
who
had
died
that
afternoon
two
had
already
been
interred
and
the
third
grave
was
in
the
process
of
being
filled
two
men
one
a
negro
and
the
other
a
white
had
nearly
completed
their
labor
tramping
down
the
crumbling
earth
as
they
shovelled
it
into
the
shallow
excavation
meanwhile
captain
obadiah
stood
near
by
his
red
coat
flaming
in
the
slanting
light
himself
smoking
a
pipe
of
tobacco
with
all
the
ease
and
coolness
imaginable
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
held
his
cane
and
as
our
hero
approached
he
turned
an
evil
countenance
upon
him
and
greeted
him
with
a
grin
at
once
droll
mischievous
and
malevolent
in
the
extreme
and
how
is
our
pretty
charmer
this
afternoon
quoth
captain
obadiah
conceive
if
you
please
of
a
man
floating
in
the
most
ecstatic
delight
of
heaven
pulled
suddenly
thence
down
into
the
most
filthy
extremity
of
hell
and
then
you
shall
understand
the
motions
of
disgust
and
repugnance
and
loathing
that
overpowered
our
hero
who
awakening
thus
suddenly
out
of
his
dream
of
love
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
that
grim
and
obscene
spectacle
of
death
who
arousing
from
such
absorbing
and
exquisite
meditations
heard
his
ears
greeted
with
so
rude
and
vulgar
an
address
acknowledging
to
himself
that
he
did
not
dare
offer
an
immediate
reply
to
his
host
he
turned
upon
his
heel
and
walked
away
without
expressing
a
single
word
he
was
not
however
permitted
to
escape
thus
easily
he
had
not
taken
above
twenty
steps
when
hearing
footsteps
behind
him
he
turned
his
head
to
discover
captain
obadiah
skipping
rapidly
after
him
in
a
prodigious
hurry
swinging
his
cane
and
chuckling
preposterously
to
himself
as
though
in
the
enjoyment
of
some
most
exquisite
piece
of
drollery
what
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
could
catch
his
breath
from
his
hurry
what
what
ca
you
answer
you
villain
why
blind
my
eyes
a
body
would
think
you
were
a
lord
son
indeed
instead
of
being
as
i
know
you
a
beggarly
runaway
servant
whom
i
took
in
like
a
mangy
cat
out
of
the
rain
but
come
come
no
offence
my
boy
i
be
no
hard
master
to
you
i
heard
how
the
wind
blows
and
i
kept
my
ears
open
to
all
your
doings
i
know
who
is
your
sweetheart
harkee
you
rascal
you
have
a
fancy
for
my
niece
have
you
well
your
apple
is
ripe
if
you
choose
to
pick
it
marry
your
charmer
and
be
damned
and
if
you
serve
me
by
taking
her
thus
in
hand
i
pay
you
twenty
pounds
upon
your
now
what
do
you
say
to
that
you
lousy
beggar
in
borrowed
clothes
our
young
gentleman
stopped
short
and
looked
his
tormentor
full
in
the
face
the
thought
of
his
father
anger
alone
had
saved
him
from
entangling
himself
in
the
web
of
his
passions
this
he
forgot
upon
the
instant
captain
obadiah
belford
quoth
he
you
the
most
consummate
villain
ever
i
beheld
in
all
of
my
life
but
if
i
have
the
to
please
the
young
lady
i
wish
i
may
die
if
i
serve
you
in
this
at
these
words
captain
obadiah
who
appeared
to
take
no
offence
at
his
guest
opinion
of
his
honesty
burst
out
into
a
great
boisterous
laugh
flinging
back
his
head
and
dropping
his
lower
jaw
so
preposterously
that
the
setting
sun
shone
straight
down
his
wide
and
cavernous
gullet
v
how
the
devil
was
cast
out
of
the
the
news
that
the
honorable
frederick
dunburne
second
son
of
the
earl
of
clandennie
was
to
marry
miss
belinda
belford
the
daughter
and
only
child
of
colonel
william
belford
of
new
hope
was
of
a
sort
to
arouse
the
keenest
and
most
lively
interest
in
all
those
parts
of
the
northern
colonies
of
america
the
day
had
been
fixed
and
all
the
circumstances
arranged
with
such
particularity
that
an
invitation
was
regarded
as
the
highest
honor
that
could
befall
the
fortunate
recipient
there
were
to
be
present
on
this
interesting
occasion
two
colonial
governors
and
their
ladies
an
english
general
the
captain
of
the
and
above
a
score
of
colonial
magnates
and
ladies
of
distinction
captain
obadiah
had
not
been
bidden
to
either
the
ceremony
or
the
breakfast
this
rebuff
he
had
accepted
with
prodigious
amusement
which
not
limiting
itself
to
the
immediate
occasion
broke
forth
at
intervals
for
above
two
weeks
now
it
might
express
itself
in
chuckles
of
the
most
delicious
entertainment
vented
as
our
captain
walked
up
and
down
the
hall
of
his
great
house
smoking
his
pipe
and
cracking
the
knuckles
of
his
fingers
at
other
times
he
would
burst
forth
into
incontrollable
fits
of
laughter
at
the
extravagant
deceit
which
he
believed
himself
to
be
imposing
upon
his
brother
colonel
belford
at
length
came
the
with
such
circumstances
of
pomp
and
display
as
the
exceeding
wealth
and
colonial
dignity
of
colonel
belford
could
surround
it
for
the
the
great
between
the
and
the
of
colonel
belford
house
were
flung
wide
open
and
a
table
extending
the
whole
length
of
the
two
apartments
was
set
with
the
most
sumptuous
and
exquisite
display
of
plate
and
china
around
the
board
were
collected
the
distinguished
company
and
the
occasion
was
remarkable
not
less
for
the
richness
of
its
display
than
for
the
exquisite
nature
of
the
repast
intended
to
celebrate
so
auspicious
an
occasion
at
the
head
of
the
board
sat
the
young
couple
radiant
with
an
engrossing
happiness
that
took
no
thought
of
what
the
future
might
have
in
store
for
it
but
was
contented
with
the
triumphant
ecstasy
of
the
moment
these
elegant
festivities
were
at
their
height
when
there
suddenly
arose
a
considerable
disputation
in
the
hallway
beyond
and
before
any
one
could
inquire
as
to
what
was
occurring
captain
obadiah
belford
came
stumping
into
the
room
swinging
his
cane
and
with
an
expression
of
the
most
malicious
triumph
impressed
upon
his
countenance
directing
his
address
to
the
bridegroom
and
paying
no
attention
to
any
other
one
of
the
company
he
cried
out
though
not
bidden
to
this
entertainment
i
have
come
to
pay
you
a
debt
i
owe
here
is
twenty
pounds
i
promised
to
pay
you
for
marrying
my
niece
therewith
he
drew
a
silk
purse
full
of
gold
pieces
from
his
pocket
which
he
hung
over
the
ferrule
of
his
cane
and
reached
across
the
table
to
the
bridegroom
that
gentleman
upon
his
part
having
expected
some
such
episode
as
this
arose
and
with
a
most
polite
and
elaborate
bow
accepted
the
same
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
now
my
young
gentleman
cried
captain
obadiah
folding
his
arms
and
tucking
his
cane
under
his
armpit
looking
the
while
from
under
his
brows
upon
the
company
with
a
most
malevolent
and
extravagant
grin
and
now
my
young
gentleman
perhaps
you
will
favor
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
here
present
with
an
account
of
what
services
they
are
i
thus
pay
for
to
be
sure
i
will
cried
out
our
hero
and
that
with
the
utmost
willingness
in
the
world
during
all
this
while
the
elegant
company
had
sat
as
with
suspended
animation
overwhelmed
with
wonder
at
the
singular
address
of
the
intruder
even
the
servants
stood
still
with
the
dishes
in
their
hands
the
better
to
hear
the
outcome
of
the
affair
the
bride
overwhelmed
by
a
sudden
and
inexplicable
anxiety
felt
the
color
quit
her
face
and
reaching
out
seized
her
lover
hand
who
took
hers
very
readily
holding
it
tight
within
his
grasp
as
for
colonel
and
madam
belford
not
knowing
what
this
remarkable
address
portended
they
sat
as
though
turned
to
stone
the
one
gone
as
white
as
ashes
and
the
other
as
red
in
the
face
as
a
cherry
our
young
gentleman
however
maintained
the
utmost
coolness
and
composure
of
demeanor
pointing
his
finger
towards
the
intruder
he
exclaimed
in
captain
obadiah
belford
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
behold
the
most
unmitigated
villain
that
ever
i
met
in
all
of
my
life
with
an
incredible
spite
and
vindictiveness
he
not
only
pursued
my
honored
colonel
belford
but
has
sought
to
wreak
an
unwarranted
revenge
upon
the
innocent
and
virtuous
young
lady
whom
i
have
now
the
honor
to
call
my
wife
but
how
has
he
overreached
himself
in
his
machinations
how
has
he
entangled
his
feet
in
the
net
which
he
himself
has
spread
i
will
tell
you
my
history
as
he
bids
me
to
do
and
you
may
then
judge
for
yourselves
at
this
unexpected
address
captain
obadiah
face
fell
from
its
expression
of
malicious
triumph
growing
longer
and
longer
until
at
last
it
was
overclouded
with
so
much
doubt
and
anxiety
that
had
he
been
threatened
by
the
loss
of
a
thousand
pounds
he
could
not
have
assumed
a
greater
appearance
of
mortification
and
dejection
meantime
regarding
him
with
a
mischievous
smile
our
young
gentleman
began
the
history
of
all
those
adventures
that
had
befallen
him
from
the
time
he
embarked
upon
the
memorable
expedition
with
his
two
companions
in
dissipation
from
york
stairs
as
his
account
proceeded
captain
obadiah
face
altered
by
degrees
from
its
natural
brown
to
a
sickly
yellow
and
then
to
so
leaden
a
hue
that
it
could
not
have
assumed
a
more
ghastly
appearance
were
he
about
to
swoon
dead
away
great
beads
of
sweat
gathered
upon
his
forehead
and
trickled
down
his
cheeks
at
last
he
could
endure
no
more
but
with
a
great
and
strident
voice
such
as
might
burst
forth
from
a
devil
tormented
he
cried
out
is
a
lie
is
all
a
monstrous
lie
he
is
a
beggarly
runaway
servant
whom
i
took
in
out
of
the
rain
and
fed
and
housed
to
have
him
turn
thus
against
me
and
strike
the
hand
that
has
benefited
him
sir
replied
our
young
gentleman
with
a
moderate
and
easy
voice
what
i
tell
you
is
no
lie
but
the
truth
if
any
here
misdoubts
my
veracity
see
here
is
a
letter
received
by
the
last
packet
from
my
honored
father
you
colonel
belford
know
his
handwriting
perfectly
well
look
at
this
and
tell
me
if
i
am
deceiving
you
at
these
words
colonel
belford
took
the
letter
with
a
hand
that
trembled
as
though
with
palsy
he
cast
his
eyes
over
it
but
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
he
read
a
single
word
therein
contained
nevertheless
he
saw
enough
to
satisfy
his
doubts
and
he
could
have
wept
so
great
was
the
relief
from
the
miserable
and
overwhelming
anxiety
that
had
taken
possession
of
him
since
the
beginning
of
his
brother
discourse
meantime
our
young
gentleman
turning
to
captain
obadiah
cried
out
sir
i
am
indeed
an
instrument
of
providence
sent
hither
to
call
your
wickedness
to
account
and
this
he
spoke
with
so
virtuous
an
air
as
to
command
the
admiration
of
all
who
heard
him
i
have
he
continued
lived
with
you
now
for
nearly
three
odious
months
and
i
know
every
particular
of
your
habits
and
such
circumstances
of
your
life
as
you
are
aware
of
i
now
proclaim
how
you
have
wickedly
and
sacrilegiously
turned
the
old
free
grace
into
a
whence
for
above
a
year
you
have
conducted
a
nefarious
and
most
inhuman
commerce
with
the
west
indies
at
these
words
captain
obadiah
being
thrown
so
suddenly
upon
his
defence
forced
himself
to
give
forth
a
huge
and
boisterous
laugh
what
then
he
cried
what
wickedness
is
there
in
that
what
if
i
have
provided
a
few
sugar
plantations
with
negro
slaves
are
there
not
those
here
present
who
would
do
no
better
if
the
opportunity
offered
the
place
is
mine
and
i
break
no
law
by
a
bit
of
quiet
i
marvel
cried
our
young
gentleman
still
in
the
same
virtuous
strain
i
marvel
that
you
can
pass
over
so
wicked
a
thing
thus
easily
i
myself
have
counted
above
fifty
graves
of
your
victims
on
pig
and
sow
point
repent
sir
while
there
is
yet
time
but
to
this
adjuration
captain
obadiah
returned
no
other
reply
than
to
burst
into
a
most
wicked
impudent
laugh
is
it
so
cried
our
young
gentleman
do
you
dare
me
to
further
exposures
then
i
have
here
another
evidence
to
confront
you
that
may
move
you
to
a
more
serious
consideration
with
these
words
he
drew
forth
from
his
pocket
a
packet
wrapped
in
soft
white
paper
this
he
unfolded
holding
up
to
the
gaze
of
all
a
bright
and
shining
object
this
he
exclaimed
i
found
in
captain
obadiah
while
i
was
hunting
for
some
wax
with
which
to
seal
a
letter
it
was
the
gold
snuffbox
of
the
late
collector
goodhouse
what
he
cried
have
you
sir
to
offer
in
explanation
of
the
manner
in
which
this
came
into
your
possession
see
here
engraved
upon
the
lid
is
the
owner
name
and
the
circumstance
of
his
having
saved
my
own
poor
life
it
was
that
first
called
my
attention
to
it
for
i
well
recollect
how
my
father
compelled
me
to
present
it
to
my
savior
how
came
it
into
your
possession
and
why
have
you
hidden
it
away
so
carefully
for
all
this
while
sir
in
the
death
of
lieutenant
goodhouse
i
suspect
you
of
a
more
sinister
fault
than
that
of
converting
yonder
poor
sanctuary
into
a
so
soon
as
captain
morris
of
your
returns
from
jamaica
i
shall
have
him
arrested
and
shall
compel
him
to
explain
what
he
knows
of
the
circumstances
of
the
lieutenant
unfortunate
murder
at
the
sight
of
so
unexpected
an
object
in
the
young
gentleman
hand
captain
obadiah
jaw
fell
and
his
cavernous
mouth
gaped
as
though
he
had
suddenly
been
stricken
with
a
palsy
he
lifted
a
trembling
hand
and
slowly
and
mechanically
passed
it
along
that
cheek
which
was
so
discolored
with
gunpowder
stain
then
suddenly
gathering
himself
together
and
regaining
those
powers
that
appeared
for
a
moment
to
have
fled
from
him
he
cried
out
aloud
i
swear
to
god
was
all
an
accident
i
pushed
him
down
the
steps
and
he
fell
and
broke
his
neck
our
young
gentleman
regarded
him
with
a
cold
and
collected
smile
that
sir
said
he
you
shall
have
the
opportunity
to
explain
to
the
proper
authorities
unless
he
added
you
choose
to
take
yourself
away
from
these
parts
and
to
escape
the
just
resentment
of
those
laws
to
which
you
may
be
responsible
for
your
misdemeanors
i
shall
roared
captain
obadiah
stand
my
trial
in
spite
of
you
all
i
shall
live
to
see
you
in
torments
yet
i
shall
he
gaped
and
stuttered
but
could
find
no
further
words
with
which
to
convey
his
infinite
rage
and
disappointed
spite
then
turning
and
with
a
furious
gesture
he
rushed
forth
and
out
of
the
house
thrusting
those
aside
who
stood
in
his
way
and
leaving
behind
him
a
string
of
curses
fit
to
set
the
whole
world
into
a
blaze
he
had
destroyed
all
the
gaiety
of
the
but
the
relief
from
the
prodigious
doubts
and
anxieties
that
had
at
first
overwhelmed
those
whom
he
had
intended
to
ruin
was
of
so
great
a
nature
that
they
thought
nothing
of
so
inconsiderable
a
circumstance
as
for
our
young
gentleman
he
had
come
forth
from
the
adventure
with
such
dignity
of
deportment
and
with
so
exalted
an
air
of
generous
rectitude
that
those
present
could
not
sufficiently
admire
at
the
continent
discretion
of
one
so
young
the
young
lady
whom
he
had
married
if
she
had
before
regarded
him
as
a
paris
and
an
achilles
incorporated
into
one
person
now
added
the
wisdom
of
a
nestor
to
the
category
of
his
accomplishments
captain
obadiah
in
spite
of
the
defiance
he
had
fulminated
against
his
enemies
and
in
spite
of
the
determination
he
had
expressed
to
remain
and
to
stand
his
trial
was
within
a
few
days
known
to
have
suddenly
and
mysteriously
departed
from
new
hope
whether
or
not
he
misdoubted
his
own
rectitude
too
greatly
to
put
it
to
the
test
of
a
trial
or
whether
the
mortification
incident
upon
the
failure
of
his
plot
was
too
great
for
him
to
support
it
was
clearly
his
purpose
never
to
return
again
for
within
a
month
the
more
valuable
of
his
belongings
were
removed
from
his
great
house
upon
pig
and
sow
point
and
were
loaded
upon
a
bark
that
came
into
the
harbor
for
that
purpose
thence
they
were
transported
no
one
knew
whither
for
captain
obadiah
was
never
afterwards
observed
in
those
parts
nor
was
the
old
ever
again
disturbed
by
such
manifestations
as
had
terrified
the
community
for
so
long
a
time
nevertheless
though
the
devil
was
thus
exorcised
from
his
the
old
church
never
lost
its
evil
reputation
until
it
was
finally
destroyed
by
fire
about
ten
years
after
the
incidents
herein
narrated
in
conclusion
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
that
when
the
honorable
frederick
dunburne
presented
his
wife
to
his
noble
family
at
home
he
was
easily
forgiven
his
in
view
of
her
extreme
beauty
and
vivacity
within
a
year
or
two
lord
carrickford
his
elder
brother
died
of
excessive
dissipation
in
florence
where
he
was
then
attached
to
the
english
embassy
so
that
our
young
gentleman
thus
became
the
to
his
father
title
and
so
both
branches
of
the
family
were
united
into
one
the
end
