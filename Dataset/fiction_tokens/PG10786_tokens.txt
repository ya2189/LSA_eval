odd
man
out
the
night
watchman
pursed
up
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
friendship
he
said
decidedly
is
a
deloosion
and
a
snare
i
more
friendships
in
my
life
than
most
people
owing
to
being
took
a
fancy
to
for
some
reason
or
other
and
they
nearly
all
came
to
a
sudden
ending
illustration
friendship
he
said
decidedly
is
a
deloosion
and
a
snare
i
remember
one
man
who
used
to
think
i
could
do
wrong
everything
i
did
was
right
to
and
now
if
i
pass
in
the
street
he
makes
a
face
as
if
he
got
a
hair
in
mouth
all
because
i
told
the
truth
one
day
when
he
was
thinking
of
getting
married
being
a
bit
in
his
mind
he
asked
me
supposing
i
was
a
gal
his
looks
would
strike
me
it
was
an
orkard
question
and
i
told
him
that
he
got
a
good
and
that
no
man
could
a
better
pal
i
said
he
got
a
good
temper
and
was
free
with
money
o
course
that
did
satisfy
and
at
last
he
told
me
to
take
a
good
look
at
and
tell
him
wot
i
thought
of
looks
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
and
at
last
i
to
tell
him
plain
that
everybody
ideas
about
looks
that
looks
everything
and
that
is
as
does
even
then
satisfied
and
at
last
i
told
speaking
as
a
pal
to
a
pal
that
if
i
was
a
gal
and
he
came
along
trying
to
court
me
i
should
go
to
the
police
about
it
i
remember
two
young
fellers
that
was
shipmates
with
me
some
years
ago
and
they
was
such
pals
that
everybody
called
the
siamese
twins
they
always
shipped
together
and
shared
lodgings
together
when
they
was
ashore
and
ted
denver
would
no
more
thought
of
going
out
without
charlie
brice
than
charlie
brice
would
thought
of
going
out
without
they
shared
their
baccy
and
their
money
and
everything
else
and
it
my
opinion
that
if
they
only
one
pair
o
boots
between
they
hopped
along
in
one
each
they
been
like
it
for
years
and
they
kept
it
up
when
they
left
the
sea
and
got
berths
ashore
anybody
knowing
them
would
ha
thought
that
nothing
but
death
could
part
but
it
happened
otherwise
there
was
a
gal
in
it
of
course
a
gal
that
ted
denver
got
into
conversation
with
on
top
of
a
bus
owing
to
her
steadying
by
putting
her
hand
on
shoulder
as
she
passed
bright
lively
sort
o
gal
she
seemed
and
afore
ted
knew
where
he
was
they
was
talking
away
as
though
they
known
each
other
for
years
charlie
did
seem
to
care
much
for
it
at
fust
but
he
did
raise
no
objection
and
when
the
gal
got
up
to
go
he
stopped
the
bus
for
by
poking
the
driver
in
the
back
and
they
all
got
off
together
ted
went
fust
to
break
her
fall
in
case
the
bus
started
off
too
sudden
and
charlie
her
down
behind
by
catching
hold
of
a
lace
collar
she
was
wearing
when
she
turned
to
speak
to
about
it
she
knocked
the
conductor
hat
off
with
umbrella
and
there
was
so
much
unpleasantness
that
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
pavement
she
told
charlie
that
she
never
wanted
to
see
his
silly
fat
face
agin
it
ai
fat
ses
ted
speaking
up
for
it
the
shape
of
it
and
it
ai
silly
ses
charlie
speaking
very
quick
mind
that
it
a
bit
o
real
lace
ses
the
gal
twisting
her
round
to
look
at
the
collar
it
cost
me
one
and
only
last
night
one
an
ses
charlie
who
not
being
a
married
man
understand
one
shilling
ses
the
gal
two
pennies
and
three
farthings
d
understand
that
yes
ses
charlie
he
cleverer
than
he
looks
ses
the
gal
turning
to
ted
i
you
right
and
it
is
the
shape
after
all
ted
walked
along
one
side
of
and
charlie
the
other
till
they
came
to
the
corner
of
the
road
where
she
lived
and
then
ted
and
stood
there
talking
till
charlie
got
sick
and
tired
of
it
and
kept
tugging
at
coat
for
to
come
away
i
coming
ses
ted
at
last
i
you
wo
be
this
way
night
he
ses
turning
to
the
gal

shoving
in
his
oar

going
to
a
night
oh

your
blessed
ses
the
gal
to
ted
i
do
want
you
she
turned
round
and
ran
up
the
road
with
ted
follering
and
begging
of
not
to
be
so
hasty
and
afore
they
parted
she
told
that
name
was
emma
white
and
promised
to
meet
there
the
next
night
at
seven
o
course

brice
turned
up

go
part
o
the
way
and
then
when
she
found
that
ted
would
send
his
mate

came
back
and
said
as
she
was
going
to
go
just
to
please
charlie
brice
she
would
speak
a
word
to
and
when
they
all
went
to
the
together
she
sat
with
her
face
turned
away
from

her
elbow
sticking
in
chest
doing
that
and
watching
the
performance
at
the
same
time
gave
a
stiff
neck
and
she
got
in
such
a
temper
over
it
she
would
hardly

away
with
a
smile
on
their
face
she
seemed
to
take
a
fancy
to
charlie
the
moment
she
set
eyes
on
and
two
or
three
times
they
lost

the
next
night
and
charlie
brice
jennings
all
alone
to
himself
for
over
a
couple
of
hours
walking
up
and
down
the
commercial
road
talking
about
the
weather
charles
saying
wet
and
cold
it
was
and
thinking
they
better
go
off
afore
she
got
a
chill
he
complained
to
ted
about
it
when

and
ted
promised
as

a
bit
and
wait
until
emma
got
more
used
to
charlie
afore
they
told
her
ted
let
get
used
to
for
three
days
more
afore
he
broke
the
news
to
and
the
way
she
went
on
was
alarming
she
went
on
for
over
ten
minutes
without
taking
breath
and
she
was
just
going
to
start
again
when
jennings
stopped
her
he
all
right
she
ses
you
leave
alone
i
not
touching
ses
emma
very
scornful
you
leave
alone
ses
jennings
taking
hold
of
charlie
arm
i
do
say
things
about
your
young
man
charlie
brice
started
as
if
he
been
shot
and
twice
he
opened
mouth
to
speak
and
show
jennings
mistake
but
wot
with
trying
to
find
voice
in
the
fust
place
and
then
finding
words
to
use
it
with
in
the
second
he
did
say
anything
he
just
walked
along
gasping
with
mouth
open
like
a
fish
do
take
no
notice
of
charlie
ses
jennings
i
i
do
mind
wot
she
ses
ses
pore
charlie
but
you
making
a
great
she
is
emma
ses
jennings
but
there
so
am
wot
you
might
call
a
generous
temper
but
quick
charlie
went
cold
all
over
treat
me
well
and
i
treat
other
people
well
ses
jennings
i
ca
say
fairer
than
that
can
i
charlie
said
nobody
could
and
then
walked
along
with
her
hanging
on
to
arm
arf
wondering
whether
it
would
be
wrong
to
shove
under
a
bus
that
was
passing
and
arf
wondering
whether
could
do
it
if
it
was
as
for
emma
saying
she
wo
you
for
a
lodger
ses
jennings
let
wait
till
she
asked
she
wait
a
long
time
if
i
my
say
charlie
did
answer
her
he
walked
along
with
mouth
shut
his
idea
being
that
the
least
said
the
soonest
mended
even
emma
asked
at
last
whether
he
lost
tongue
and
said
it
was
curious
different
love
took
different
people
he
talked
fast
enough
going
with
ted
though
and
pretty
near
lost
temper
with
when
ted
asked
why
he
did
tell
jennings
straight
that
she
made
a
mistake
she
knows
well
enough
he
says
grinding
teeth
she
was
just
trying
it
on
that
it
is
widders
get
married
agin
you
to
choose
between
going
out
with
me
or
emma
ted
i
ca
face
jennings
again
i
did
think
anybody
could
parted
us
like
that
ted
said
it
was
all
nonsense
but
it
was
no
good
and
the
next
night
he
went
off
alone
and
came
back
very
cross
saying
that
jennings
been
with
all
the
time
and
when
spoke
to
emma
about
it
she
said
it
was
just
tit
for
tat
and
reminded
she
had
to
put
up
with
charlie
for
four
nights
running
went
out
for
walks
with
emma
holding
one
of
arms
and
jennings
the
other
it
miserable
for
you
all
alone
by
yourself

he
ses
why

come
she
ca
marry
you
against
your
will
besides
i
miss
you
charlie
shook
with
but
said
would
walk
out
with
jennings
for
a
fortune
and
all
that
ted
could
say
made
no
difference
he
stayed
indoors
of
an
evening
reading
the
paper
or
going
for
little
walks
by
until
at
last
ted
came
one
evening
smiling
all
over
his
face
and
told
they
had

of
themselves
