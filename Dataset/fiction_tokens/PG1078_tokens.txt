the
scouts
of
the
valley
by
joseph
altsheler
chapter
i
the
lone
canoe
a
light
canoe
of
bark
containing
a
single
human
figure
moved
swiftly
up
one
of
the
twin
streams
that
form
the
ohio
the
water
clear
and
deep
coming
through
rocky
soil
babbled
gently
at
the
edges
where
it
lapped
the
land
but
in
the
center
the
full
current
flowed
steadily
and
without
noise
the
thin
shadows
of
early
dusk
were
falling
casting
a
pallid
tint
over
the
world
a
tint
touched
here
and
there
with
living
fire
from
the
sun
which
was
gone
though
leaving
burning
embers
behind
one
glowing
shaft
piercing
straight
through
the
heavy
forest
that
clothed
either
bank
fell
directly
upon
the
figure
in
the
boat
as
a
hidden
light
illuminates
a
great
picture
while
the
rest
is
left
in
shadow
it
was
no
common
forest
runner
who
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
red
beam
yet
a
boy
in
nothing
but
years
he
swung
the
great
paddle
with
an
ease
and
vigor
that
the
strongest
man
in
the
west
might
have
envied
his
rifle
with
the
stock
carved
beautifully
and
the
long
slender
blue
barrel
of
the
border
lay
by
his
side
he
could
bring
the
paddle
into
the
boat
grasp
the
rifle
and
carry
it
to
his
shoulder
with
a
single
continuous
movement
his
most
remarkable
aspect
one
that
the
casual
observer
even
would
have
noticed
was
an
extraordinary
vitality
he
created
in
the
minds
of
those
who
saw
him
a
feeling
that
he
lived
intensely
every
moment
of
his
life
born
in
the
forest
he
was
essentially
its
child
a
perfect
physical
being
trained
by
the
utmost
hardship
and
danger
and
with
every
faculty
mental
and
physical
in
complete
coordination
it
is
only
by
a
singular
combination
of
time
and
place
and
only
once
in
millions
of
chances
that
nature
produces
such
a
being
the
canoe
remained
a
few
moments
in
the
center
of
the
red
light
and
its
occupant
with
a
slight
swaying
motion
of
the
paddle
held
it
steady
in
the
current
while
he
listened
every
feature
stood
out
in
the
glow
the
firm
chin
the
straight
strong
nose
the
blue
eyes
and
the
thick
yellow
hair
the
red
blue
and
yellow
beads
on
his
dress
of
beautifully
tanned
deerskin
flashed
in
the
brilliant
rays
he
was
the
great
picture
of
fact
not
of
fancy
a
human
being
animated
by
a
living
dauntless
soul
he
gave
the
paddle
a
single
sweep
and
shot
from
the
light
into
the
shadow
his
canoe
did
not
stop
until
it
grazed
the
northern
shore
where
bushes
and
overhanging
boughs
made
a
deep
shadow
it
would
have
taken
a
keen
eye
now
to
have
seen
either
the
canoe
or
its
occupant
and
henry
ware
paddled
slowly
and
without
noise
in
the
darkest
heart
of
the
shadow
the
sunlight
lingered
a
little
longer
in
the
center
of
the
stream
then
the
red
changed
to
pink
the
pink
in
its
turn
faded
and
the
whole
surface
of
the
river
was
somber
gray
flowing
between
two
lines
of
black
forest
the
coming
of
the
darkness
did
not
stop
the
boy
he
swung
a
little
farther
out
into
the
stream
where
the
bushes
and
hanging
boughs
would
not
get
in
his
way
and
continued
his
course
with
some
increase
of
speed
the
great
paddle
swung
swiftly
through
the
water
and
the
length
of
stroke
was
amazing
but
the
boy
breath
did
not
come
faster
and
the
muscles
on
his
arms
and
shoulders
rippled
as
if
it
were
the
play
of
a
child
henry
was
in
waters
unknown
to
him
he
had
nothing
more
than
hearsay
upon
which
to
rely
and
he
used
all
the
wilderness
caution
that
he
had
acquired
through
nature
and
training
he
called
into
use
every
faculty
of
his
perfect
physical
being
his
trained
eyes
continually
pierced
the
darkness
at
times
he
stopped
and
listened
with
ears
that
could
hear
the
footfall
of
the
rabbit
but
neither
eye
nor
ear
brought
report
of
anything
unusual
the
river
flowed
with
a
soft
sighing
sound
now
and
then
a
wild
creature
stirred
in
the
forest
and
once
a
deer
came
down
to
the
margin
to
drink
but
this
was
the
ordinary
life
of
the
woods
and
he
passed
it
by
he
went
on
hour
after
hour
the
river
narrowed
the
banks
grew
higher
and
rockier
and
the
water
deep
and
silvery
under
the
moon
flowed
in
a
somewhat
swifter
current
henry
gave
a
little
stronger
sweep
to
the
paddle
and
the
speed
of
the
canoe
was
maintained
he
still
kept
within
the
shadow
of
the
northern
bank
he
noticed
after
a
while
that
fleecy
vapor
was
floating
before
the
moon
the
night
seemed
to
be
darkening
and
a
rising
wind
came
out
of
the
southwest
the
touch
of
the
air
on
his
face
was
damp
it
was
the
token
of
rain
and
he
felt
that
it
would
not
be
delayed
long
it
was
no
part
of
his
plan
to
be
caught
in
a
storm
on
the
monongahela
besides
the
discomfort
heavy
rain
and
wind
might
sink
his
frail
canoe
and
he
looked
for
a
refuge
the
river
was
widening
again
and
the
banks
sank
down
until
they
were
but
little
above
the
water
presently
he
saw
a
place
that
he
knew
would
be
suitable
a
stretch
of
thick
bushes
and
weeds
growing
into
the
very
edge
of
the
water
and
extending
a
hundred
yards
or
more
along
the
shore
he
pushed
his
canoe
far
into
the
undergrowth
and
then
stopped
it
in
shelter
so
close
that
keen
as
his
own
eyes
were
he
could
scarcely
see
the
main
stream
of
the
river
the
water
where
he
came
to
rest
was
not
more
than
a
foot
deep
but
he
remained
in
the
canoe
half
reclining
and
wrapping
closely
around
himself
and
his
rifle
a
beautiful
blanket
woven
of
the
tightest
fiber
his
position
with
his
head
resting
on
the
edge
of
the
canoe
and
his
shoulder
pressed
against
the
side
was
full
of
comfort
to
him
and
he
awaited
calmly
whatever
might
come
here
and
there
were
little
spaces
among
the
leaves
overhead
and
through
them
he
saw
a
moon
now
almost
hidden
by
thick
and
rolling
vapors
and
a
sky
that
had
grown
dark
and
somber
the
last
timid
star
had
ceased
to
twinkle
and
the
rising
wind
was
wet
and
cold
he
was
glad
of
the
blanket
and
skilled
forest
runner
that
he
was
he
never
traveled
without
it
henry
remained
perfectly
still
the
light
canoe
did
not
move
beneath
his
weight
the
fraction
of
an
inch
his
upturned
eyes
saw
the
little
cubes
of
sky
that
showed
through
the
leaves
grow
darker
and
darker
the
bushes
about
him
were
now
bending
before
the
wind
which
blew
steadily
from
the
south
and
presently
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
lightly
on
the
water
the
boy
alone
in
the
midst
of
all
that
vast
wilderness
surrounded
by
danger
in
its
most
cruel
forms
and
with
a
black
midnight
sky
above
him
felt
neither
fear
nor
awe
being
what
nature
and
circumstance
had
made
him
he
was
conscious
instead
of
a
deep
sense
of
peace
and
comfort
he
was
at
ease
in
a
nest
for
the
night
and
there
was
only
the
remotest
possibility
that
the
prying
eye
of
an
enemy
would
see
him
the
leaves
directly
over
his
head
were
so
thick
that
they
formed
a
canopy
and
as
he
heard
the
drops
fall
upon
them
it
was
like
the
rain
on
a
roof
that
soothes
the
one
beneath
its
shelter
distant
lightning
flared
once
or
twice
and
low
thunder
rolled
along
the
southern
horizon
but
both
soon
ceased
and
then
a
rain
not
hard
but
cold
and
persistent
began
to
fall
coming
straight
down
henry
saw
that
it
might
last
all
night
but
he
merely
eased
himself
a
little
in
the
canoe
drew
the
edges
of
the
blanket
around
his
chin
and
let
his
eyelids
droop
the
rain
was
now
seeping
through
the
leafy
canopy
of
green
but
he
did
not
care
it
could
not
penetrate
the
close
fiber
of
the
blanket
and
the
fur
cap
drawn
far
down
on
his
head
met
the
blanket
only
his
face
was
uncovered
and
when
a
cold
drop
fell
upon
it
it
was
to
him
hardened
by
forest
life
cool
and
pleasant
to
the
touch
although
the
eyelids
still
drooped
he
did
not
yet
feel
the
tendency
to
sleep
it
was
merely
a
deep
luxurious
rest
with
the
body
completely
relaxed
but
with
the
senses
alert
the
wind
ceased
to
blow
and
the
rain
came
down
straight
with
an
even
beat
that
was
not
unmusical
no
other
sound
was
heard
in
the
forest
as
the
ripple
of
the
river
at
the
edges
was
merged
into
it
henry
began
to
feel
the
desire
for
sleep
by
and
by
and
laying
the
paddle
across
the
boat
in
such
a
way
that
it
sheltered
his
face
he
closed
his
eyes
in
five
minutes
he
would
have
been
sleeping
as
soundly
as
a
man
in
a
warm
bed
under
a
roof
but
with
a
quick
motion
he
suddenly
put
the
paddle
aside
and
raised
himself
a
little
in
the
canoe
while
one
hand
slipped
down
under
the
folds
of
the
blanket
to
the
hammer
of
his
rifle
his
ear
had
told
him
in
time
that
there
was
a
new
sound
on
the
river
he
heard
it
faintly
above
the
even
beat
of
the
rain
a
soft
sound
long
and
sighing
but
regular
he
listened
and
then
he
knew
it
it
was
made
by
oars
many
of
them
swung
in
unison
keeping
admirable
time
henry
did
not
yet
feel
fear
although
it
must
be
a
long
boat
full
of
indian
warriors
as
it
was
not
likely
that
anybody
else
would
be
abroad
upon
these
waters
at
such
a
time
he
made
no
attempt
to
move
where
he
lay
it
was
black
as
the
darkest
cave
and
his
cool
judgment
told
him
that
there
was
no
need
of
flight
the
regular
rhythmic
beat
of
the
oars
came
nearer
and
presently
as
he
looked
through
the
covert
of
leaves
the
dusky
outline
of
a
great
war
canoe
came
into
view
it
contained
at
least
twenty
warriors
of
what
tribe
he
could
not
tell
but
they
were
wet
and
they
looked
cold
and
miserable
soon
they
were
opposite
him
and
he
saw
the
outline
of
every
figure
scalp
locks
drooped
in
the
rain
and
he
knew
that
the
warriors
hardy
as
they
might
be
were
suffering
henry
expected
to
see
the
long
boat
pass
on
but
it
was
turned
toward
a
shelving
bank
fifty
or
sixty
yards
below
and
they
beached
it
there
then
all
sprang
out
drew
it
up
on
the
land
and
after
turning
it
over
propped
it
up
at
an
angle
when
this
was
done
they
sat
under
it
in
a
close
group
sheltered
from
the
rain
they
were
using
their
great
canoe
as
a
roof
after
the
habit
of
shawnees
and
wyandots
the
boy
watched
them
for
a
long
time
through
one
of
the
little
openings
in
the
bushes
and
he
believed
that
they
would
remain
as
they
were
all
night
but
presently
he
saw
a
movement
among
them
and
a
little
flash
of
light
he
understood
it
they
were
trying
to
kindle
a
flint
and
steel
under
the
shelter
of
the
boat
he
continued
to
watch
them
and
without
alarm
their
fire
if
they
succeeded
in
making
it
would
cast
no
light
upon
him
in
the
dense
covert
but
they
would
be
outlined
against
the
flame
and
he
could
see
them
better
well
enough
perhaps
to
tell
to
what
tribe
they
belonged
he
watched
under
his
lowered
eyelids
while
the
warriors
gathered
in
a
close
group
to
make
a
shelter
from
stray
puffs
of
wind
strove
with
flint
and
steel
sparks
sprang
up
and
went
out
but
henry
at
last
saw
a
little
blaze
rise
and
cling
to
life
then
fed
with
tinder
and
bark
it
grew
under
the
roof
made
by
the
boat
until
it
was
ruddy
and
strong
the
boat
was
tilted
farther
back
and
the
fire
continuing
to
grow
crackled
cheerfully
while
the
flames
leaped
higher
by
a
curious
transfer
of
the
senses
henry
as
he
lay
in
the
thick
blackness
felt
the
influence
of
the
fire
also
its
warmth
was
upon
his
face
and
it
was
pleasing
to
see
the
red
and
yellow
light
victorious
against
the
sodden
background
of
the
rain
and
dripping
forest
the
figures
of
the
warriors
passed
and
repassed
before
the
fire
and
the
boy
in
the
boat
moved
suddenly
his
body
was
not
shifted
more
than
an
inch
but
his
surprise
was
great
a
warrior
stood
between
him
and
the
fire
outlined
perfectly
against
the
red
light
it
was
a
splendid
figure
young
much
beyond
the
average
height
the
erect
and
noble
head
crowned
with
the
defiant
scalplock
the
strong
slightly
curved
nose
and
the
massive
chin
cut
as
clearly
as
if
they
had
been
carved
in
copper
the
man
who
had
laid
aside
a
wet
blanket
was
bare
now
to
the
waist
and
henry
could
see
the
powerful
muscles
play
on
chest
and
shoulders
as
he
moved
the
boy
knew
him
it
was
timmendiquas
the
great
white
lightning
of
the
wyandots
the
youngest
but
the
boldest
and
ablest
of
all
the
western
chiefs
henry
pulses
leaped
a
little
at
the
sight
of
his
old
foe
and
almost
friend
as
always
he
felt
admiration
at
the
sight
of
the
young
chief
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
ever
behold
such
another
magnificent
specimen
of
savage
manhood
the
presence
of
timmendiquas
so
far
east
was
also
full
of
significance
the
great
fleet
under
adam
colfax
and
with
henry
and
his
comrades
in
the
van
had
reached
pittsburgh
at
last
thence
the
arms
ammunition
and
other
supplies
were
started
on
the
overland
journey
for
the
american
army
but
the
five
lingered
before
beginning
the
return
to
kentucky
a
rumor
came
that
the
indian
alliance
was
spreading
along
the
entire
frontier
both
west
and
north
it
was
said
that
timmendiquas
stung
to
fiery
energy
by
his
defeats
was
coming
east
to
form
a
league
with
the
iroquois
the
famous
six
nations
these
warlike
tribes
were
friendly
with
the
wyandots
and
the
league
would
be
a
formidable
danger
to
the
colonies
the
full
strength
of
which
was
absorbed
already
in
the
great
war
but
the
report
was
a
new
call
of
battle
to
henry
sol
and
the
others
the
return
to
kentucky
was
postponed
they
could
be
of
greater
service
here
and
they
plunged
into
the
great
woods
to
the
north
and
east
to
see
what
might
be
stirring
among
the
warriors
now
henry
as
he
looked
at
timmendiquas
knew
that
report
had
told
the
truth
the
great
chief
would
not
be
on
the
fringe
of
the
iroquois
country
if
he
did
not
have
such
a
plan
and
he
had
the
energy
and
ability
to
carry
it
through
henry
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
tomahawk
flashing
along
every
mile
of
a
frontier
so
vast
and
defended
so
thinly
he
was
glad
in
every
fiber
that
he
and
his
comrades
had
remained
to
hang
upon
the
indian
hordes
and
be
heralds
of
their
marches
in
the
forest
a
warning
usually
meant
the
saving
of
life
the
rain
ceased
after
a
while
although
water
dripped
from
the
trees
everywhere
but
the
big
fire
made
an
area
of
dry
earth
about
it
and
the
warriors
replaced
the
long
boat
in
the
water
then
all
but
four
or
five
of
them
lay
beside
the
coals
and
went
to
sleep
timmendiquas
was
one
of
those
who
remained
awake
and
henry
saw
that
he
was
in
deep
thought
he
walked
back
and
forth
much
like
a
white
man
and
now
and
then
he
folded
his
hands
behind
his
back
looking
toward
the
earth
but
not
seeing
it
henry
could
guess
what
was
in
his
mind
he
would
draw
forth
the
full
power
of
the
six
nations
league
them
with
the
indians
of
the
great
valley
and
hurl
them
all
in
one
mass
upon
the
frontier
he
was
planning
now
the
means
to
the
end
the
chief
in
his
little
walks
back
and
forth
came
close
to
the
edge
of
the
bushes
in
which
henry
lay
it
was
not
at
all
probable
that
he
would
conclude
to
search
among
them
but
some
accident
a
chance
might
happen
and
henry
began
to
feel
a
little
alarm
certainly
the
coming
of
the
day
would
make
his
refuge
insecure
and
he
resolved
to
slip
away
while
it
was
yet
light
the
boy
rose
a
little
in
the
boat
slowly
and
with
the
utmost
caution
because
the
slightest
sound
out
of
the
common
might
arouse
timmendiquas
to
the
knowledge
of
a
hostile
presence
the
canoe
must
make
no
plash
in
the
water
gradually
he
unwrapped
the
blanket
and
tied
it
in
a
folded
square
at
his
back
then
he
took
thought
a
few
moments
the
forest
was
so
silent
now
that
he
did
not
believe
he
could
push
the
canoe
through
the
bushes
without
being
heard
he
would
leave
it
there
for
use
another
day
and
go
on
foot
through
the
woods
to
his
comrades
slowly
he
put
one
foot
down
the
side
until
it
rested
on
the
bottom
and
then
he
remained
still
the
chief
had
paused
in
his
restless
walk
back
and
forth
could
it
be
possible
that
he
had
heard
so
slight
a
sound
as
that
of
a
human
foot
sinking
softly
into
the
water
henry
waited
with
his
rifle
ready
if
necessary
he
would
fire
and
then
dart
away
among
the
bushes
five
or
six
intense
moments
passed
and
the
chief
resumed
his
restless
pacing
if
he
had
heard
he
had
passed
it
by
as
nothing
and
henry
raised
the
other
foot
out
of
the
canoe
he
was
as
delicate
in
his
movement
as
a
surgeon
mending
the
human
eye
and
he
had
full
cause
as
not
eye
alone
but
life
as
well
depended
upon
his
success
both
feet
now
rested
upon
the
muddy
bottom
and
he
stood
there
clear
of
the
boat
the
chief
did
not
stop
again
and
as
the
fire
had
burned
higher
his
features
were
disclosed
more
plainly
in
his
restless
walk
back
and
forth
before
the
flames
henry
took
a
final
look
at
the
lofty
features
contracted
now
into
a
frown
then
began
to
wade
among
the
bushes
pushing
his
way
softly
this
was
the
most
delicate
and
difficult
task
of
all
the
water
must
not
be
allowed
to
plash
around
him
nor
the
bushes
to
rustle
as
he
passed
forward
he
went
a
yard
then
two
five
ten
and
his
feet
were
about
to
rest
upon
solid
earth
when
a
stick
submerged
in
the
mud
broke
under
his
moccasin
with
a
snap
singularly
loud
in
the
silence
of
the
night
henry
sprang
at
once
upon
dry
land
whence
he
cast
back
a
single
swift
glance
he
saw
the
chief
standing
rigid
and
gazing
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
had
come
other
warriors
were
just
behind
him
following
his
look
aware
that
there
was
an
unexpected
presence
in
the
forest
and
resolved
to
know
its
nature
henry
ran
northward
so
confident
was
he
in
his
powers
and
the
protecting
darkness
of
the
night
that
he
sent
back
a
sharp
cry
piercing
and
defiant
a
cry
of
a
quality
that
could
come
only
from
a
white
throat
the
warriors
would
know
it
and
he
intended
for
them
to
know
it
then
holding
his
rifle
almost
parallel
with
his
body
he
darted
swiftly
away
through
the
black
spaces
of
the
forest
but
an
answering
cry
came
to
his
the
indian
yell
taking
up
his
challenge
and
saying
that
the
night
would
not
check
pursuit
henry
maintained
his
swift
pace
for
a
long
time
choosing
the
more
open
places
that
he
might
make
no
noise
among
the
bushes
and
leaves
now
and
then
water
dripped
in
his
face
and
his
moccasins
were
wet
from
the
long
grass
but
his
body
was
warm
and
dry
and
he
felt
little
weariness
the
clouds
were
now
all
gone
and
the
stars
sprang
out
dancing
in
a
sky
of
dusky
blue
trained
eyes
could
see
far
in
the
forest
despite
the
night
and
henry
felt
that
he
must
be
wary
he
recalled
the
skill
and
tenacity
of
timmendiquas
a
fugitive
could
scarcely
be
trailed
in
the
darkness
but
the
great
chief
would
spread
out
his
forces
like
a
fan
and
follow
he
had
been
running
perhaps
three
hours
when
he
concluded
to
stop
in
a
thicket
where
he
lay
down
on
the
damp
grass
and
rested
with
his
head
under
his
arm
his
breath
had
been
coming
a
little
faster
but
his
heart
now
resumed
its
regular
beat
then
he
heard
a
soft
sound
that
of
footsteps
he
thought
at
first
that
some
wild
animal
was
prowling
near
but
second
thought
convinced
him
that
human
beings
had
come
gazing
through
the
thicket
he
saw
an
indian
warrior
walking
among
the
trees
looking
searchingly
about
him
as
if
he
were
a
scout
another
coming
from
a
different
direction
approached
him
and
henry
felt
sure
that
they
were
of
the
party
of
timmendiquas
they
had
followed
him
in
some
manner
perhaps
by
chance
and
it
behooved
mm
now
to
lie
close
a
third
warrior
joined
them
and
they
began
to
examine
the
ground
henry
realized
that
it
was
much
lighter
keen
eyes
under
such
a
starry
sky
could
see
much
and
they
might
strike
his
trail
the
fear
quickly
became
fact
one
of
the
warriors
uttering
a
short
cry
raised
his
head
and
beckoned
to
the
others
he
had
seen
broken
twigs
or
trampled
grass
and
henry
knowing
that
it
was
no
time
to
hesitate
sprang
from
his
covert
two
of
the
warriors
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
dusky
figure
and
fired
the
bullets
cutting
the
leaves
close
to
his
head
but
henry
ran
so
fast
that
he
was
lost
to
view
in
an
instant
the
boy
was
conscious
that
his
position
contained
many
elements
of
danger
he
was
about
to
have
another
example
of
the
tenacity
and
resource
of
the
great
young
chief
of
the
wyandots
and
he
felt
a
certain
anger
he
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
in
his
plans
he
wished
to
rejoin
his
comrades
and
move
farther
east
toward
the
chosen
lands
of
the
six
nations
instead
he
must
spend
precious
moments
running
for
his
life
henry
did
not
now
flee
toward
the
camp
of
his
friends
he
was
too
wise
too
unselfish
to
bring
a
horde
down
upon
them
and
he
curved
away
in
a
course
that
would
take
him
to
the
south
of
them
he
glanced
up
and
saw
that
the
heavens
were
lightening
yet
more
a
thin
gray
color
like
a
mist
was
appearing
in
the
east
it
was
the
herald
of
day
and
now
the
indians
would
be
able
to
find
his
trail
but
henry
was
not
afraid
his
anger
over
the
loss
of
time
quickly
passed
and
he
ran
swiftly
on
the
fall
of
his
moccasins
making
scarcely
any
noise
as
he
passed
it
was
no
unusual
incident
thousands
of
such
pursuits
occurred
in
the
border
life
of
our
country
and
were
lost
to
the
chronicler
for
generations
they
were
almost
a
part
of
the
daily
life
of
the
frontier
but
the
present
while
not
out
of
the
common
in
itself
had
uncommon
phases
it
was
the
most
splendid
type
of
white
life
in
all
the
wilderness
that
fled
and
the
finest
type
of
red
life
that
followed
it
was
impossible
for
henry
to
feel
anger
or
hate
toward
timmendiquas
in
his
place
he
would
have
done
what
he
was
doing
it
was
hard
to
give
up
these
great
woods
and
beautiful
lakes
and
rivers
and
the
wild
life
that
wild
men
lived
and
loved
there
was
so
much
chivalry
in
the
nature
that
he
could
think
of
all
these
things
while
he
fled
to
escape
the
tomahawk
or
the
stake
up
came
the
sun
the
gray
light
turned
to
silver
and
then
to
red
and
blazing
gold
a
long
swelling
note
the
triumphant
cry
of
the
pursuing
warriors
rose
behind
him
henry
turned
his
head
for
one
look
he
saw
a
group
of
them
poised
for
a
moment
on
the
crest
of
a
low
hill
and
outlined
against
the
broad
flame
in
the
east
he
saw
their
scalp
locks
the
rifles
in
their
hands
and
their
bare
chests
shining
bronze
in
the
glow
once
more
he
sent
back
his
defiant
cry
now
in
answer
to
theirs
and
then
calling
upon
his
reserves
of
strength
and
endurance
fled
with
a
speed
that
none
of
the
warriors
had
ever
seen
surpassed
henry
flight
lasted
all
that
day
and
he
used
every
device
to
evade
the
pursuit
swinging
by
vines
walking
along
fallen
logs
and
wading
in
brooks
he
did
not
see
the
warriors
again
but
instinct
warned
him
that
they
were
yet
following
at
long
intervals
he
would
rest
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
among
the
bushes
and
at
noon
he
ate
a
little
of
the
venison
that
he
always
carried
three
hours
later
he
came
to
the
river
again
and
swimming
it
he
turned
on
his
course
but
kept
to
the
southern
side
when
the
twilight
was
falling
once
more
he
sat
still
in
dense
covert
for
a
long
time
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
a
sign
of
human
presence
and
he
was
sure
now
that
the
pursuit
had
failed
without
an
effort
he
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
ate
a
little
more
of
the
venison
and
made
his
bed
for
the
night
the
whole
day
had
been
bright
with
a
light
wind
blowing
and
the
forest
was
dry
once
more
as
far
as
henry
could
see
it
circled
away
on
every
side
a
solid
dark
green
the
leaves
of
oak
and
beech
maple
and
elm
making
a
soft
sighing
sound
as
they
waved
gently
in
the
wind
it
told
henry
of
nothing
but
peace
he
had
eluded
the
pursuit
hence
it
was
no
more
this
was
a
great
friendly
forest
ready
to
shelter
him
to
soothe
him
and
to
receive
him
into
its
arms
for
peaceful
sleep
he
found
a
place
among
thick
trees
where
the
leaves
of
last
year
lay
deep
upon
the
ground
he
drew
up
enough
of
them
for
a
soft
bed
because
now
and
for
the
moment
he
was
a
forest
sybarite
he
was
wise
enough
to
take
his
ease
when
he
found
it
knowing
that
it
would
pay
his
body
to
relax
he
lay
down
upon
the
leaves
placed
the
rifle
by
his
side
and
spread
the
blanket
over
himself
and
the
weapon
the
twilight
was
gone
and
the
night
dark
and
without
stars
as
he
wished
to
see
it
rolled
up
fold
after
fold
covering
and
hiding
everything
he
looked
a
little
while
at
a
breadth
of
inky
sky
showing
through
the
leaves
and
then
free
from
trouble
or
fear
he
fell
asleep
chapter
ii
the
mysterious
hand
henry
slept
until
a
rosy
light
filtering
through
the
leaves
fell
upon
his
face
then
he
sprang
up
folded
the
blanket
once
more
upon
his
back
and
looked
about
him
nothing
had
come
in
the
night
to
disturb
him
no
enemy
was
near
and
the
morning
sun
was
bright
and
beautiful
the
venison
was
exhausted
but
he
bathed
his
face
in
the
brook
and
resumed
his
journey
traveling
with
a
long
swift
stride
that
carried
him
at
great
speed
the
boy
was
making
for
a
definite
point
one
that
he
knew
well
although
nearly
all
the
rest
of
this
wilderness
was
strange
to
him
the
country
here
was
rougher
than
it
usually
is
in
the
great
valley
to
the
west
and
as
he
advanced
it
became
yet
more
broken
range
after
range
of
steep
stony
hills
with
fertile
but
narrow
little
valleys
between
he
went
on
without
hesitation
for
at
least
two
hours
and
then
stopping
under
a
great
oak
he
uttered
a
long
whining
cry
much
like
the
howl
of
a
wolf
it
was
not
a
loud
note
but
it
was
singularly
penetrating
carrying
far
through
the
forest
a
sound
like
an
echo
came
back
but
henry
knew
that
instead
of
an
echo
it
was
a
reply
to
his
own
signal
then
he
advanced
boldly
and
swiftly
and
came
to
the
edge
of
a
snug
little
valley
set
deep
among
rocks
and
trees
like
a
bowl
he
stopped
behind
the
great
trunk
of
a
beech
and
looked
into
the
valley
with
a
smile
of
approval
four
human
figures
were
seated
around
a
fire
of
smoldering
coals
that
gave
forth
no
smoke
they
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
some
very
pleasant
task
and
a
faint
odor
that
came
to
henry
nostrils
filled
him
with
agreeable
anticipations
he
stepped
forward
boldly
and
called
save
that
piece
for
me
long
jim
hart
halted
in
the
large
slice
of
venison
that
he
had
toasted
on
a
stick
paul
cotter
sprang
joyfully
to
his
feet
silent
tom
ross
merely
looked
up
but
sol
said
henry
would
be
here
in
time
for
henry
walked
down
in
the
valley
and
the
shiftless
one
regarded
him
keenly
should
judge
henry
ware
that
you
been
hevin
a
foot
race
he
drawled
why
do
you
think
that
asked
henry
kin
see
where
the
briars
hev
been
rakin
across
your
leggins
reckon
that
would
happen
you
was
in
a
right
said
henry
jim
you
been
holding
that
venison
in
the
air
long
enough
give
it
to
me
and
after
i
eaten
it
i
tell
you
all
that
i
been
doing
and
all
that
been
done
to
long
jim
handed
him
the
slice
henry
took
a
comfortable
seat
in
the
circle
before
the
coals
and
ate
with
all
the
appetite
of
a
powerful
human
creature
whose
food
had
been
more
than
scanty
for
at
least
two
days
another
piece
said
long
jim
observing
him
with
approval
two
pieces
take
three
take
the
whole
deer
i
always
like
to
see
a
hungry
man
eat
it
gives
him
sech
satisfaction
that
i
git
a
kind
uv
taste
uv
it
henry
did
not
offer
a
word
explanation
until
his
breakfast
was
over
then
lie
leaned
back
sighing
twice
with
deep
content
and
said
i
got
a
lot
to
sol
moved
into
an
easier
position
on
the
leaves
guess
it
has
somethin
to
do
with
them
scratches
on
your
has
continued
henry
with
emphasis
i
want
to
say
to
you
boys
that
i
seen
timmendiquas
the
great
white
lightning
of
the
exclaimed
the
others
together
less
a
man
than
he
resumed
henry
looked
upon
his
very
face
i
seen
him
in
camp
with
warriors
and
i
had
the
honor
of
being
pursued
by
him
and
his
men
more
hours
than
i
can
tell
that
why
you
see
those
briar
scratches
on
my
leggins
we
can
not
doubt
that
he
is
here
to
stir
the
six
nations
to
continued
war
said
paul
cotter
he
will
succeed
he
is
a
mighty
chief
and
his
fire
and
eloquence
will
make
them
take
up
the
hatchet
i
glad
that
we
come
we
delayed
a
league
once
between
the
shawnees
and
the
miamis
i
do
think
we
can
stop
this
one
but
we
may
get
some
people
out
of
the
way
before
the
blow
are
these
six
nations
whose
name
sounds
so
big
up
here
asked
long
jim
name
is
as
big
as
it
sounds
replied
henry
are
the
onondagas
the
mohawks
oneidas
senecas
cayugas
and
tuscaroras
they
used
to
be
the
five
nations
but
the
tuscaroras
came
up
from
the
south
and
fought
against
them
so
bravely
that
they
were
adopted
into
the
league
as
a
new
and
friendly
tribe
the
onondagas
so
i
heard
formed
the
league
a
long
long
time
ago
and
their
head
chief
is
the
grand
sachem
or
high
priest
of
them
all
but
the
head
chief
of
the
mohawks
is
the
leading
war
heard
said
paul
the
wyandots
are
kinsmen
of
all
these
tribes
and
on
that
account
they
will
listen
with
all
the
more
friendliness
to
to
me
said
tom
ross
we
got
a
most
big
job
said
henry
must
make
a
most
tremendous
big
so
agreed
all
after
that
they
spoke
little
the
last
coals
were
covered
up
and
the
remainder
of
the
food
was
put
in
their
pouches
then
they
sat
on
the
leaves
and
every
one
meditated
until
such
time
as
he
might
have
something
worth
saying
henry
thoughts
traveled
on
a
wide
course
but
they
always
came
back
to
one
point
they
had
heard
much
at
pittsburgh
of
a
famous
mohawk
chief
called
thayendanegea
but
most
often
known
to
the
americans
as
brant
he
was
young
able
and
filled
with
intense
animosity
against
the
white
people
who
encroached
every
year
more
and
more
upon
the
indian
hunting
grounds
his
was
a
soul
full
kin
to
that
of
timmendiquas
and
if
the
two
met
it
meant
a
great
council
and
a
greater
endeavor
for
the
undoing
of
the
white
man
what
more
likely
than
that
they
intended
to
meet
of
you
have
heard
of
thayendanegea
the
mohawk
said
henry
they
nodded
my
opinion
that
timmendiquas
is
on
the
way
to
meet
him
i
remember
hearing
a
hunter
say
at
pittsburgh
that
about
a
hundred
miles
to
the
east
of
this
point
was
a
long
house
or
council
house
of
the
six
nations
timmendiquas
is
sure
to
go
there
and
we
must
go
too
we
must
find
out
where
they
intend
to
strike
what
do
you
say
go
there
exclaimed
four
voices
together
seldom
has
a
council
of
war
been
followed
by
action
so
promptly
as
henry
spoke
the
last
word
he
rose
and
the
others
rose
with
him
saying
no
more
he
led
toward
the
east
and
the
others
followed
him
also
saying
no
more
separately
every
one
of
them
was
strong
brave
and
resourceful
but
when
the
five
were
together
they
felt
that
they
had
the
skill
and
strength
of
twenty
the
long
rest
at
pittsburgh
had
restored
them
after
the
dangers
and
hardship
of
their
great
voyage
from
new
orleans
they
carried
in
horn
and
pouch
ample
supplies
of
powder
and
bullet
and
they
did
not
fear
any
task
their
journey
continued
through
hilly
country
clothed
in
heavy
forest
but
often
without
undergrowth
they
avoided
the
open
spaces
preferring
to
be
seen
of
men
who
were
sure
to
be
red
men
as
little
as
possible
their
caution
was
well
taken
they
saw
indian
signs
once
a
feather
that
had
fallen
from
a
scalp
lock
once
footprints
and
once
the
bone
of
a
deer
recently
thrown
away
by
him
who
had
eaten
the
meat
from
it
the
country
seemed
to
be
as
wild
as
that
of
kentucky
small
settlements
so
they
had
heard
were
scattered
at
great
distances
through
the
forest
but
they
saw
none
there
was
no
cabin
smoke
no
trail
of
the
plow
just
the
woods
and
the
hills
and
the
clear
streams
buffalo
had
never
reached
this
region
but
deer
were
abundant
and
they
risked
a
shot
to
replenish
their
supplies
they
camped
the
second
night
of
their
march
on
a
little
peninsula
at
the
confluence
of
two
creeks
with
the
deep
woods
everywhere
henry
judged
that
they
were
well
within
the
western
range
of
the
six
nations
and
they
cooked
their
deer
meat
over
a
smothered
fire
nothing
more
than
a
few
coals
among
the
leaves
when
supper
was
over
they
arranged
soft
places
for
themselves
and
their
blankets
all
except
long
jim
whose
turn
it
was
to
scout
among
the
woods
for
a
possible
foe
be
gone
long
jim
said
henry
as
he
composed
himself
in
a
comfortable
position
circle
of
a
half
mile
about
us
will
not
be
gone
more
an
hour
said
long
jim
picking
up
his
rifle
confidently
and
flitting
away
among
the
woods
likely
he
see
anything
said
sol
i
shorely
like
to
know
what
white
lightning
is
about
he
must
be
terrible
stirred
up
by
them
beatin
he
got
down
on
the
ohio
an
they
say
that
mohawk
thayendanegea
is
a
whoppin
big
chief
too
they
shorely
make
a
heap
of
both
of
them
are
far
from
here
just
now
said
henry
we
bother
about
he
was
lying
on
some
leaves
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
with
his
arm
under
his
head
and
his
blanket
over
his
body
he
had
a
remarkable
capacity
for
dismissing
trouble
or
apprehension
and
just
then
he
was
enjoying
great
physical
and
mental
peace
he
looked
through
half
closed
eyes
at
his
comrades
who
also
were
enjoying
repose
and
his
fancy
could
reproduce
long
jim
in
the
forest
slipping
from
tree
to
tree
and
bush
to
bush
and
finding
no
menace
good
does
it
henry
said
the
shiftless
one
like
a
clean
bold
country
like
this
no
more
plowin
around
in
swamps
for
said
henry
sleepily
a
good
the
hour
slipped
smoothly
by
and
paul
said
for
long
jim
to
be
do
do
things
by
halves
said
the
shiftless
one
beatin
up
every
squar
inch
o
the
bushes
he
be
here
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
and
long
jim
did
not
return
a
half
hour
and
no
sign
of
him
henry
cast
off
the
blanket
and
stood
up
the
night
was
not
very
dark
and
he
could
see
some
distance
but
he
did
not
see
their
comrade
wonder
why
he
so
slow
he
said
with
a
faint
trace
of
anxiety
be
directly
said
tom
ross
with
confidence
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
no
long
jim
henry
sent
forth
the
low
penetrating
cry
of
the
wolf
that
they
used
so
often
as
a
signal
can
not
fail
to
hear
that
he
said
he
no
answer
came
the
four
looked
at
one
another
in
alarm
long
jim
had
been
gone
nearly
two
hours
and
he
was
long
overdue
his
failure
to
reply
to
the
signal
indicated
either
that
something
ominous
had
happened
or
that
he
had
gone
much
farther
than
they
meant
for
him
to
go
the
others
had
risen
to
their
feet
also
and
they
stood
a
little
while
in
silence
do
you
think
it
means
asked
paul
must
be
all
right
said
sol
jim
has
lost
the
henry
shook
his
head
is
that
he
said
is
too
good
a
woodsman
for
such
a
mistake
i
do
want
to
look
on
the
black
side
boys
but
i
think
something
has
happened
to
you
an
me
go
an
look
for
him
said
sol
paul
and
tom
stay
here
an
keep
better
do
it
said
henry
the
two
rifles
in
the
hollows
of
their
arms
disappeared
in
the
darkness
while
tom
and
paul
withdrew
into
the
deepest
shadow
of
the
trees
and
waited
henry
and
the
shiftless
one
pursued
an
anxious
quest
going
about
the
camp
in
a
great
circle
and
then
in
another
yet
greater
they
did
not
find
jim
and
the
dusk
was
so
great
that
they
saw
no
evidences
of
his
trail
long
jim
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
he
had
left
the
earth
for
another
planet
when
they
felt
that
they
must
abandon
the
search
for
the
time
henry
and
sol
looked
at
each
other
in
a
dismay
that
the
dusk
could
not
hide
be
saw
some
kind
uv
a
sign
an
has
followed
it
said
the
shiftless
one
hopefully
anything
looked
mysterious
an
troublesome
jim
would
want
to
hunt
it
hope
so
said
henry
we
got
to
go
back
to
the
camp
now
and
report
failure
perhaps
he
show
up
but
i
do
like
it
sol
i
do
like
it
more
do
i
said
sol
like
jim
not
to
come
back
ef
he
could
mebbe
he
drop
in
afore
day
they
returned
to
the
camp
and
two
inquiring
figures
rose
up
out
of
the
darkness
ai
seen
him
said
tom
noting
that
but
two
figures
had
returned
a
trace
replied
henry
a
singular
the
four
talked
together
a
little
while
and
they
were
far
from
cheerful
then
three
sought
sleep
while
henry
stayed
on
watch
sitting
with
his
back
against
a
tree
and
his
rifle
on
his
knees
all
the
peace
and
content
that
he
had
felt
earlier
in
the
evening
were
gone
he
was
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
danger
mysterious
and
powerful
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
long
jim
could
have
gone
away
in
such
a
noiseless
manner
leaving
no
trace
behind
but
it
was
true
he
watched
with
both
ear
and
eye
as
much
for
long
jim
as
for
an
enemy
he
was
still
hopeful
that
he
would
see
the
long
thin
figure
coming
among
the
bushes
and
then
hear
the
old
pleasant
drawl
but
he
did
not
see
the
figure
nor
did
he
hear
the
drawl
time
passed
with
the
usual
slow
step
when
one
watches
paul
sol
and
tom
were
asleep
but
henry
was
never
wider
awake
in
his
life
he
tried
to
put
away
the
feeling
of
mystery
and
danger
he
assured
himself
that
long
jim
would
soon
come
delayed
by
some
trail
that
he
had
sought
to
solve
nothing
could
have
happened
to
a
man
so
brave
and
skillful
his
nerves
must
be
growing
weak
when
he
allowed
himself
to
be
troubled
so
much
by
a
delayed
return
but
the
new
hours
came
one
by
one
and
long
jim
came
with
none
of
them
the
night
remained
fairly
light
with
a
good
moon
but
the
light
that
it
threw
over
the
forest
was
gray
and
uncanny
henry
feeling
of
mystery
and
danger
deepened
once
he
thought
he
heard
a
rustling
in
the
thicket
and
finger
on
the
trigger
of
his
rifle
he
stole
among
the
bushes
to
discover
what
caused
it
he
found
nothing
and
returning
to
his
lonely
watch
saw
that
paul
sol
and
tom
were
still
sleeping
soundly
but
henry
was
annoyed
greatly
by
the
noise
and
yet
more
by
his
failure
to
trace
its
origin
after
an
hour
watching
he
looked
a
second
time
the
result
was
once
more
in
vain
and
he
resumed
his
seat
upon
the
leaves
with
his
back
reclining
against
an
oak
here
despite
the
fact
that
the
night
was
growing
darker
nothing
within
range
of
a
rifle
shot
could
escape
his
eyes
nothing
stirred
the
noise
did
not
come
a
second
time
from
the
thicket
the
very
silence
was
oppressive
there
was
no
wind
not
even
a
stray
puff
and
the
bushes
never
rustled
henry
longed
for
a
noise
of
some
kind
to
break
that
terrible
oppressive
silence
what
he
really
wished
to
hear
was
the
soft
crunch
of
long
jim
moccasins
on
the
grass
and
leaves
the
night
passed
the
day
came
and
henry
awakened
his
comrades
long
jim
was
still
missing
and
their
alarm
was
justified
whatever
trail
lie
might
have
struck
he
would
have
returned
in
the
night
unless
something
had
happened
to
him
henry
had
vague
theories
but
nothing
definite
and
he
kept
them
to
himself
yet
they
must
make
a
change
in
their
plans
to
go
on
and
leave
long
jim
to
whatever
fate
might
be
his
was
unthinkable
no
task
could
interfere
with
the
duty
of
the
five
to
one
another
are
in
one
of
the
most
dangerous
of
all
the
indian
countries
said
henry
are
on
the
fringe
of
the
region
over
which
the
six
nations
roam
and
we
know
that
timmendiquas
and
a
band
of
the
wyandots
are
here
also
perhaps
miamis
and
shawnees
have
come
got
to
find
long
jim
said
silent
tom
briefly
they
went
about
their
task
in
five
minutes
breakfast
consisted
of
cold
venison
and
a
drink
from
a
brook
then
they
began
to
search
the
forest
they
felt
sure
that
such
woodsmen
as
they
with
the
daylight
to
help
them
would
find
some
trace
of
long
jim
but
they
saw
none
at
all
although
they
constantly
widened
their
circle
and
again
tried
all
their
signals
half
the
forenoon
passed
in
the
vain
search
and
then
they
held
a
council
think
we
better
scatter
said
sol
meet
here
again
when
the
sun
marks
it
was
agreed
and
they
took
careful
note
of
the
place
a
little
hill
crowned
with
a
thick
cluster
of
black
oaks
a
landmark
easy
to
remember
henry
turned
toward
the
south
and
the
forest
was
so
dense
that
in
two
minutes
all
his
comrades
were
lost
to
sight
he
went
several
miles
and
his
search
was
most
rigid
he
was
amazed
to
find
that
the
sense
of
mystery
and
danger
that
he
attributed
to
the
darkness
of
the
night
did
not
disappear
wholly
in
the
bright
daylight
his
spirit
usually
so
optimistic
was
oppressed
by
it
and
he
had
no
belief
that
they
would
find
long
jim
at
the
set
time
he
returned
to
the
little
hill
crowned
with
the
black
oaks
and
as
he
approached
it
from
one
side
he
saw
sol
coming
from
another
the
shiftless
one
walked
despondently
his
gait
was
loose
and
rare
thing
with
him
and
henry
knew
that
he
too
had
failed
he
realized
now
that
he
had
not
expected
anything
else
sol
shook
his
head
sat
down
on
a
root
and
said
nothing
henry
sat
down
also
and
the
two
exchanged
a
look
of
discouragement
others
will
be
here
directly
said
henry
perhaps
long
jim
will
be
with
one
of
but
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
it
would
not
be
so
and
the
shiftless
one
knew
that
he
had
no
confidence
in
his
own
words
not
said
henry
resolved
to
see
the
better
side
stay
anyhow
until
we
find
him
we
ca
spare
good
old
long
sol
did
not
reply
nor
did
henry
speak
again
until
lie
saw
the
bushes
moving
slightly
three
or
four
hundred
yards
away
comes
tom
he
said
after
a
single
comprehensive
glance
he
tom
ross
was
also
a
dejected
figure
he
looked
at
the
two
on
the
hill
and
seeing
that
the
man
for
whom
they
were
searching
was
not
with
them
became
more
dejected
than
before
our
last
chance
he
said
as
he
joined
them
a
lucky
boy
an
mebbe
it
will
be
so
with
him
hope
so
said
henry
fervently
ought
to
be
along
in
a
few
they
waited
patiently
although
they
really
had
no
belief
that
paul
would
bring
in
the
missing
man
but
paul
was
late
the
noon
hour
was
well
past
henry
took
a
glance
at
the
sun
noon
was
gone
at
least
a
half
hour
and
he
stirred
uneasily
could
get
lost
in
broad
daylight
he
said
said
sol
could
get
lost
henry
noticed
his
emphasis
on
the
word
and
a
sudden
fear
sprang
up
in
his
heart
some
power
had
taken
away
long
jim
could
the
same
power
have
seized
paul
it
was
a
premonition
and
he
paled
under
his
brown
turning
away
lest
the
others
see
his
face
all
three
now
examined
the
whole
circle
of
the
horizon
for
a
sight
of
moving
bushes
that
would
tell
of
the
boy
coming
the
forest
told
nothing
the
sun
blazed
brightly
over
everything
and
paul
like
long
jim
did
not
come
he
was
an
hour
past
due
and
the
three
oppressed
already
by
long
jim
disappearance
were
convinced
that
he
would
not
return
but
they
gave
him
a
half
hour
longer
then
henry
said
must
hunt
for
him
but
we
must
not
separate
whatever
happens
we
three
must
stay
not
hankerin
to
roam
jest
now
all
by
myself
said
the
shiftless
one
with
an
uneasy
laugh
the
three
hunted
all
that
afternoon
for
paul
once
they
saw
trace
of
footsteps
apparently
his
in
some
soft
earth
but
they
were
quickly
lost
on
hard
ground
and
after
that
there
was
nothing
they
stopped
shortly
before
sunset
at
the
edge
of
a
narrow
but
deep
creek
do
you
think
of
it
henry
asked
sol
do
know
what
to
think
replied
the
youth
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
took
away
jim
has
taken
away
paul
like
it
said
sol
i
guess
it
follers
that
we
in
the
same
kind
o
three
of
us
could
put
up
a
good
fight
said
henry
i
propose
that
we
do
go
back
to
that
camp
but
spend
the
night
an
watch
good
said
tom
ross
their
new
camp
was
made
quickly
in
silence
merely
the
grass
under
the
low
boughs
of
a
tree
their
supper
was
a
little
venison
and
then
they
watched
the
coming
of
the
darkness
it
was
a
heavy
hour
for
the
three
long
jim
was
gone
and
then
the
youngest
and
in
a
way
the
pet
of
the
little
band
we
could

making
such
big
plans
too
and
before
we
can
even
start
our
force

cut
nearly
in
half
we
begin
the
hunt
again
we
never
desert
paul
and
jim
so
long
as
we
do
know
they
my
watch
said
tom
two
sleep
we
got
to
keep
our
henry
and
the
shiftless
one
acquiesced
and
seeking
the
softest
spots
under
the
tree
sat
down
tom
ross
took
his
place
about
ten
feet
in
front
of
them
sitting
on
the
ground
with
his
hands
clasped
around
his
knees
and
his
rifle
resting
on
his
arm
henry
watched
him
idly
for
a
little
while
thinking
all
the
time
of
his
lost
comrades
the
night
promised
to
be
dark
a
good
thing
for
them
as
the
need
of
hiding
was
too
evident
sol
soon
fell
asleep
as
henry
only
three
feet
away
knew
by
his
soft
and
regular
breathing
but
the
boy
himself
was
still
the
darkness
seemed
to
sink
down
like
a
great
blanket
dropping
slowly
and
the
area
of
henry
vision
narrowed
to
a
small
circle
within
this
area
the
distinctive
object
was
the
figure
of
tom
ross
sitting
with
his
rifle
across
his
knees
tom
had
an
infinite
capacity
for
immobility
henry
had
never
seen
another
man
not
even
an
indian
who
could
remain
so
long
in
one
position
contented
and
happy
he
believed
that
the
silent
one
could
sit
as
he
was
all
night
his
surmise
about
tom
began
to
have
a
kind
of
fascination
for
him
would
he
remain
absolutely
still
he
would
certainly
shift
an
arm
or
a
leg
henry
interest
in
the
question
kept
him
awake
he
turned
silently
on
the
other
side
but
no
matter
how
intently
he
studied
the
sitting
figure
of
his
comrade
he
could
not
see
it
stir
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
had
been
awake
trying
thus
to
decide
a
question
that
should
be
of
no
importance
at
such
a
time
although
unable
to
sleep
he
fell
into
a
dreamy
condition
and
continued
vaguely
to
watch
the
rigid
and
silent
sentinel
he
suddenly
saw
tom
stir
and
he
came
from
his
state
of
languor
the
exciting
question
was
solved
at
last
the
man
would
not
sit
all
night
absolutely
immovable
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
fact
that
he
had
raised
an
arm
and
that
his
figure
had
straightened
then
he
stood
up
full
height
remained
motionless
for
perhaps
ten
seconds
and
then
suddenly
glided
away
among
the
bushes
henry
knew
what
this
meant
tom
had
heard
something
moving
in
the
thickets
and
like
a
good
sentinel
he
had
gone
to
investigate
a
rabbit
doubtless
or
perhaps
a
sneaking
raccoon
henry
rose
to
a
sitting
position
and
drew
his
own
rifle
across
his
knees
he
would
watch
while
tom
was
gone
and
then
lie
would
sink
quietly
back
not
letting
his
comrade
know
that
lie
had
taken
his
place
the
faintest
of
winds
began
to
stir
among
the
thickets
light
clouds
drifted
before
the
moon
henry
sitting
with
his
rifle
across
his
knees
and
sol
asleep
in
the
shadows
were
invisible
but
henry
saw
beyond
the
circle
of
darkness
that
enveloped
them
into
the
grayish
light
that
fell
over
the
bushes
he
marked
the
particular
point
at
which
he
expected
tom
ross
to
appear
a
slight
opening
that
held
out
invitation
for
the
passage
of
a
man
he
waited
a
long
time
ten
minutes
twenty
a
half
hour
and
the
sentinel
did
not
return
henry
came
abruptly
out
of
his
dreamy
state
he
felt
with
all
the
terrible
thrill
of
certainty
that
what
happened
to
long
jim
and
paul
had
happened
also
to
silent
tom
ross
he
stood
erect
a
tense
tall
figure
alarmed
but
not
afraid
his
eyes
searched
the
thickets
but
saw
nothing
the
slight
movement
of
the
bushes
was
made
by
the
wind
and
no
other
sound
reached
his
ears
but
he
might
be
mistaken
after
all
the
most
convincing
premonitions
were
sometimes
wrong
he
would
give
tom
ten
minutes
more
and
he
sank
down
in
a
crouching
position
where
he
would
offer
the
least
target
for
the
eye
the
appointed
time
passed
and
neither
sight
nor
sound
revealed
any
sign
of
tom
ross
then
henry
awakened
sol
and
whispered
to
him
all
that
he
had
seen
took
jim
and
paul
has
took
him
whispered
the
shiftless
one
at
once
henry
nodded
we
bound
to
look
for
him
right
now
continued
sol
said
henry
we
must
stay
together
if
we
follow
the
others
sol
we
must
follow
would
be
safer
said
sol
an
idee
that
we
wo
find
tom
i
want
to
tell
you
henry
this
thing
is
gittin
on
my
it
was
certainly
on
henry
also
but
without
reply
he
led
the
way
into
the
bushes
and
they
sought
long
and
well
for
silent
tom
keeping
at
the
same
time
a
thorough
watch
for
any
danger
that
might
molest
themselves
but
no
danger
showed
nor
did
they
find
tom
or
his
trail
he
too
had
vanished
into
nothingness
and
henry
and
sol
despite
their
mental
strength
felt
cold
shivers
they
came
back
at
last
far
toward
morning
to
the
bank
of
the
creek
it
was
here
as
elsewhere
a
narrow
but
deep
stream
flowing
between
banks
so
densely
wooded
that
they
were
almost
like
walls
will
be
daylight
soon
said
sol
i
think
we
better
lay
low
in
thicket
an
watch
it
looks
ez
ef
we
could
find
anything
so
we
better
wait
an
see
what
will
find
looks
like
the
best
plan
to
me
said
henry
i
think
we
might
first
hunt
a
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
we
have
looked
any
over
so
replied
sol
the
water
is
at
least
seven
feet
deep
here
an
we
do
want
to
make
any
splash
swimmin
suppose
you
go
up
stream
an
i
go
down
an
the
one
that
finds
a
ford
first
kin
give
a
signal
one
uv
us
ought
to
strike
shallow
water
in
three
or
four
hundred
henry
followed
the
current
toward
the
south
while
sol
moved
up
the
stream
the
boy
went
cautiously
through
the
dense
foliage
and
the
creek
soon
grew
wider
and
shallower
at
a
distance
of
about
three
hundred
yards
lie
came
to
a
point
where
it
could
be
waded
easily
then
he
uttered
the
low
cry
that
was
their
signal
and
went
back
to
meet
sol
he
reached
the
exact
point
at
which
they
had
parted
and
waited
the
shiftless
one
did
not
come
the
last
of
his
comrades
was
gone
and
he
was
alone
in
the
forest
chapter
iii
the
hut
on
the
islet
henry
ware
waited
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
by
the
creek
on
the
exact
spot
at
which
he
and
solomon
hyde
called
the
shiftless
one
had
parted
but
he
knew
all
the
while
that
his
last
comrade
was
not
coming
the
same
powerful
and
mysterious
hand
that
swept
the
others
away
had
taken
him
the
wary
and
cunning
sol
master
of
forest
lore
and
with
all
the
five
senses
developed
to
the
highest
pitch
yet
his
powers
had
availed
him
nothing
and
the
boy
again
felt
that
cold
chill
running
down
his
spine
henry
expected
the
omnipotent
force
to
come
against
him
also
but
his
instinctive
caution
made
him
turn
and
creep
into
the
thickest
of
the
forest
continuing
until
he
found
a
place
in
the
bushes
so
thoroughly
hidden
that
no
one
could
see
him
ten
feet
away
there
he
lay
down
and
rapidly
ran
over
in
his
mind
the
events
connected
with
the
four
disappearances
they
were
few
and
he
had
little
on
which
to
go
but
his
duty
to
seek
his
four
comrades
since
he
alone
must
do
it
was
all
the
greater
such
a
thought
as
deserting
them
and
fleeing
for
his
own
life
never
entered
his
mind
he
would
not
only
seek
them
but
he
would
penetrate
the
mystery
of
the
power
that
had
taken
them
it
was
like
him
now
to
go
about
his
work
with
calmness
and
method
to
approach
an
arduous
task
right
one
must
possess
freshness
and
vigor
and
one
could
have
neither
without
sleep
his
present
place
of
hiding
seemed
to
be
as
secure
as
any
that
could
be
found
so
composing
himself
he
took
all
chances
and
sought
slumber
yet
it
needed
a
great
effort
of
the
will
to
calm
his
nerves
and
it
was
a
half
hour
before
he
began
to
feel
any
of
the
soothing
effect
that
precedes
sleep
but
fall
asleep
he
did
at
last
and
despite
everything
he
slept
soundly
until
the
morning
henry
did
not
awake
to
a
bright
day
the
sun
had
risen
but
it
was
obscured
by
gray
clouds
and
the
whole
heavens
were
somber
a
cold
wind
began
to
blow
and
with
it
came
drops
of
rain
he
shivered
despite
the
enfolding
blanket
the
coming
of
the
morning
had
invariably
brought
cheerfulness
and
increase
of
spirits
but
now
he
felt
depression
he
foresaw
heavy
rain
again
and
it
would
destroy
any
but
the
deepest
trail
moreover
his
supplies
of
food
were
exhausted
and
he
must
replenish
them
in
some
manner
before
proceeding
further
a
spirit
even
as
bold
and
strong
as
henry
might
well
have
despaired
he
had
found
his
comrades
only
to
lose
them
again
and
the
danger
that
had
threatened
them
and
the
elements
as
well
now
threatened
him
too
an
acute
judge
of
sky
and
air
he
knew
that
the
rain
cold
insistent
penetrating
would
fall
all
day
and
that
he
must
seek
shelter
if
he
would
keep
his
strength
the
indians
themselves
always
took
to
cover
at
such
times
he
wrapped
the
blanket
around
himself
covering
his
body
well
from
neck
to
ankle
putting
his
rifle
just
inside
the
fold
but
with
his
hand
upon
it
ready
for
instant
use
if
it
should
be
needed
then
he
started
walking
straight
ahead
until
he
came
to
the
crown
of
a
little
hill
the
clouds
meanwhile
thickened
and
the
rain
of
the
kind
that
he
had
foreseen
and
as
cold
as
ice
was
blown
against
him
the
grass
and
bushes
were
reeking
and
his
moccasins
became
sodden
despite
the
vigorous
walking
lie
felt
the
wet
cold
entering
his
system
there
come
times
when
the
hardiest
must
yield
and
he
saw
the
increasing
need
of
refuge
he
surveyed
the
country
attentively
from
the
low
hill
all
around
was
a
dull
gray
horizon
from
which
the
icy
rain
dripped
everywhere
there
was
no
open
country
all
was
forest
and
the
heavy
rolling
masses
of
foliage
dripped
with
icy
water
too
toward
the
south
the
land
seemed
to
dip
down
and
henry
surmised
that
in
a
valley
he
would
be
more
likely
to
find
the
shelter
that
he
craved
he
needed
it
badly
as
he
stood
there
he
shivered
again
and
again
from
head
to
foot
despite
the
folds
of
the
blanket
so
he
started
at
once
walking
fast
and
feeling
little
fear
of
a
foe
it
was
not
likely
that
any
would
be
seeking
him
at
such
a
time
the
rain
struck
him
squarely
in
the
face
now
water
came
from
his
moccasins
every
time
his
foot
was
pressed
against
the
earth
and
no
matter
how
closely
he
drew
the
folds
of
the
blanket
little
streams
of
it
like
ice
to
the
touch
flowed
down
his
neck
and
made
their
way
under
his
clothing
he
could
not
remember
a
time
when
he
had
felt
more
miserable
he
came
in
about
an
hour
to
the
dip
which
as
he
had
surmised
was
the
edge
of
a
considerable
valley
he
ran
down
the
slope
and
looked
all
about
for
some
place
of
shelter
a
thick
windbreak
in
the
lee
of
a
hill
or
an
outcropping
of
stone
but
he
saw
neither
and
as
he
continued
the
search
he
came
to
marshy
ground
he
saw
ahead
among
the
weeds
and
bushes
the
gleam
of
standing
pools
and
he
was
about
to
turn
back
when
he
noticed
three
or
four
stones
in
a
row
and
about
a
yard
from
one
another
projecting
slightly
above
the
black
muck
it
struck
him
that
the
stones
would
not
naturally
be
in
the
soft
mud
and
his
curiosity
aroused
he
stepped
lightly
from
one
stone
to
another
when
he
came
to
the
last
stone
that
he
had
seen
from
the
hard
ground
he
beheld
several
more
that
had
been
hidden
from
him
by
the
bushes
sure
now
that
he
had
happened
upon
something
not
created
by
nature
alone
he
followed
these
stones
leading
like
steps
into
the
very
depths
of
the
swamp
which
was
now
deep
and
dark
with
ooze
all
about
him
he
no
longer
doubted
that
the
stones
the
artificial
presence
of
which
might
have
escaped
the
keenest
eye
and
most
logical
mind
were
placed
there
for
a
purpose
and
he
was
resolved
to
know
its
nature
the
stepping
stones
led
him
about
sixty
yards
into
the
swamp
and
the
last
thirty
yards
were
at
an
angle
from
the
first
thirty
then
he
came
to
a
bit
of
hard
ground
a
tiny
islet
in
the
mire
upon
which
he
could
stand
without
sinking
at
all
he
looked
back
from
there
and
he
could
not
see
his
point
of
departure
bushes
weeds
and
saplings
grew
out
of
the
swamp
to
a
height
of
a
dozen
or
fifteen
feet
and
he
was
inclosed
completely
all
the
vegetation
dripped
with
cold
water
and
the
place
was
one
of
the
most
dismal
that
he
had
ever
seen
but
he
had
no
thought
of
turning
back
henry
made
a
shrewd
guess
as
to
whither
the
path
led
but
he
inferred
from
the
appearance
of
the
stepping
from
the
fact
that
an
odd
one
here
and
there
had
sunk
completely
out
of
they
had
not
been
used
in
a
long
time
perhaps
for
years
he
found
on
the
other
side
of
the
islet
a
second
line
of
stones
and
they
led
across
a
marsh
that
was
almost
like
a
black
liquid
to
another
and
larger
island
here
the
ground
was
quite
firm
supporting
a
thick
growth
of
large
trees
it
seemed
to
henry
that
this
island
might
be
seventy
or
eighty
yards
across
and
he
began
at
once
to
explore
it
in
the
center
surrounded
so
closely
by
swamp
oaks
that
they
almost
formed
a
living
wall
he
found
what
he
had
hoped
to
find
and
his
relief
was
so
great
that
despite
his
natural
and
trained
stoicism
he
gave
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
when
he
saw
it
a
small
lodge
made
chiefly
of
poles
and
bark
after
the
iroquois
fashion
stood
within
the
circle
of
the
trees
occupying
almost
the
whole
of
the
space
it
was
apparently
abandoned
long
ago
and
time
and
weather
had
done
it
much
damage
but
the
bark
walls
although
they
leaned
in
places
at
dangerous
angles
still
stood
the
bark
roof
was
pierced
by
holes
on
one
side
but
on
the
other
it
was
still
solid
and
shed
all
the
rain
from
its
slope
the
door
was
open
but
a
shutter
made
of
heavy
pieces
of
bark
cunningly
joined
together
leaned
against
the
wall
and
henry
saw
that
he
could
make
use
of
it
he
stepped
inside
the
hut
had
a
bark
floor
which
was
dry
on
one
side
where
the
roof
was
solid
but
dripping
on
the
other
several
old
articles
of
indian
use
lay
about
in
one
corner
was
a
basket
woven
of
split
willow
and
still
fit
for
service
there
were
pieces
of
thread
made
of
indian
hemp
and
the
inner
bark
of
the
elm
there
were
also
a
piece
of
pottery
and
a
large
beautifully
carved
wooden
spoon
such
as
every
iroquois
carried
in
the
corner
farthest
from
the
door
was
a
rude
fireplace
made
of
large
flat
stones
although
there
was
no
opening
for
the
smoke
henry
surveyed
it
all
thoughtfully
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
hut
for
hunting
built
by
some
warrior
of
an
inquiring
mind
who
had
found
this
secret
place
and
who
had
recognized
its
possibilities
here
after
an
expedition
for
game
he
could
lie
hidden
from
enemies
and
take
his
comfort
without
fear
doubtless
he
had
sat
in
this
hut
on
rainy
days
like
the
present
one
and
smoked
his
pipe
in
the
long
patient
calm
of
which
the
indian
is
capable
yes
there
was
the
pipe
unnoticed
before
trumpet
shaped
and
carved
beautifully
lying
on
a
small
bark
shelf
henry
picked
it
tip
and
examined
the
bowl
it
was
as
dry
as
a
bone
and
not
a
particle
of
tobacco
was
left
there
he
believed
that
it
had
not
been
used
for
at
least
a
year
doubtless
the
indian
who
had
built
this
hunting
lodge
had
fallen
in
some
foray
and
the
secret
of
it
had
been
lost
until
henry
ware
seeking
through
the
cold
and
rain
had
stumbled
upon
it
it
was
nothing
but
a
dilapidated
little
lodge
of
poles
and
bark
all
but
the
materials
of
a
house
were
there
and
henry
was
strong
and
skillful
he
covered
the
holes
in
the
roof
with
fallen
pieces
of
bark
laying
heavy
pieces
of
wood
across
them
to
hold
them
in
place
then
he
lifted
the
bark
shutter
into
position
and
closed
the
door
some
drops
of
rain
still
came
in
through
the
roof
but
they
were
not
many
and
he
would
not
mind
them
for
the
present
then
he
opened
the
door
and
began
his
hardest
task
he
intended
to
build
a
fire
on
the
flat
stones
and
securing
fallen
wood
he
stripped
off
the
bark
and
cut
splinters
from
the
inside
it
was
slow
work
and
he
was
very
cold
his
wet
feet
sending
chills
through
him
but
he
persevered
and
the
little
heap
of
dry
splinters
grew
to
a
respectable
size
then
he
cut
larger
pieces
laying
them
on
one
side
while
he
worked
with
his
flint
and
steel
on
the
splinters
flint
and
steel
are
not
easily
handled
even
by
the
most
skillful
and
henry
saw
the
spark
leap
up
and
die
out
many
times
before
it
finally
took
hold
of
the
end
of
the
tiniest
splinter
and
grew
he
watched
it
as
it
ran
along
the
little
piece
of
wood
and
ignited
another
and
then
another
the
beautiful
little
red
and
yellow
flames
leaping
up
half
a
foot
in
height
already
he
felt
the
grateful
warmth
and
glow
but
he
would
not
let
himself
indulge
in
premature
joy
he
fed
it
with
larger
and
larger
pieces
until
the
flames
a
deeper
and
more
beautiful
red
and
yellow
rose
at
least
two
feet
and
big
coals
began
to
form
he
left
the
door
open
a
while
in
order
that
the
smoke
might
go
out
but
when
the
fire
had
become
mostly
coals
he
closed
it
again
all
except
a
crack
of
about
six
inches
which
would
serve
at
once
to
let
any
stray
smoke
out
and
to
let
plenty
of
fresh
air
in
now
henry
all
his
preparations
made
no
detail
neglected
proceeded
to
luxuriate
he
spread
the
soaked
blanket
out
on
the
bark
floor
took
off
the
sodden
moccasins
and
placed
them
at
one
angle
of
the
fire
while
he
sat
with
his
bare
feet
in
front
what
a
glorious
warmth
it
was
it
seemed
to
enter
at
his
toes
and
proceed
upward
through
his
body
seeking
out
every
little
nook
and
cranny
to
dry
and
warm
it
and
fill
it
full
of
new
glow
and
life
he
sat
there
a
long
time
his
being
radiating
with
physical
comfort
the
moccasins
dried
on
one
side
and
he
turned
the
other
finally
they
dried
all
over
and
all
through
and
he
put
them
on
again
then
he
hung
the
blanket
on
the
bark
wall
near
the
fire
and
it
too
would
be
dry
in
another
hour
or
so
he
foresaw
a
warm
and
dry
place
for
the
night
and
sleep
now
if
one
only
had
food
but
he
must
do
without
that
for
the
present
he
rose
and
tested
all
his
bones
and
muscles
no
stiffness
or
soreness
had
come
from
the
rain
and
cold
and
he
was
satisfied
he
was
fit
for
any
physical
emergency
he
looked
out
through
the
crevice
night
was
coming
and
on
the
little
island
in
the
swamp
it
looked
inexpressibly
black
and
gloomy
his
stomach
complained
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
acknowledging
primitive
necessity
and
resumed
his
seat
by
the
fire
there
he
sat
until
the
blanket
had
dried
and
deep
night
had
fully
come
in
the
last
hour
or
two
henry
did
not
move
he
remained
before
the
fire
crouched
slightly
forward
while
the
generous
heat
fed
the
flame
of
life
in
him
a
glowing
bar
penetrating
the
crevice
at
the
door
fell
on
the
earth
outside
but
it
did
not
pass
beyond
the
close
group
of
circling
trees
the
rain
still
fell
with
uncommon
steadiness
and
persistence
but
at
times
hail
was
mingled
with
it
henry
could
not
remember
in
his
experience
a
more
desolate
night
it
seemed
that
the
whole
world
dwelt
in
perpetual
darkness
and
that
he
was
the
only
living
being
on
it
yet
within
the
four
or
five
feet
square
of
the
hut
it
was
warm
and
bright
and
he
was
not
unhappy
he
would
forget
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
wrapping
himself
in
the
dry
blanket
he
lay
down
before
the
bed
of
coals
having
first
raked
ashes
over
them
and
he
slept
one
of
the
soundest
sleeps
of
his
life
all
night
long
the
dull
cold
rain
fell
and
with
it
at
intervals
came
gusts
of
hail
that
rattled
like
bird
shot
on
the
bark
walls
of
the
hut
some
of
the
white
pellets
blew
in
at
the
door
and
lay
for
a
moment
or
two
on
the
floor
then
melted
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
and
were
gone
but
neither
wind
rain
nor
hail
awoke
henry
he
was
as
safe
for
the
time
in
the
hut
on
the
islet
as
if
he
were
in
the
fort
at
pittsburgh
or
behind
the
palisades
at
wareville
dawn
came
the
sky
still
heavy
and
dark
with
clouds
and
the
rain
still
falling
henry
after
his
first
sense
of
refreshment
and
pleasure
became
conscious
of
a
fierce
hunger
that
no
amount
of
the
will
could
now
keep
quiet
his
was
a
powerful
system
needing
much
nourishment
and
he
must
eat
that
hunger
became
so
great
that
it
was
acute
physical
pain
he
was
assailed
by
it
at
all
points
and
it
could
be
repelled
by
only
one
thing
food
he
must
go
forth
taking
all
risks
and
seek
it
he
put
on
fresh
wood
covering
it
with
ashes
in
order
that
it
might
not
blaze
too
high
and
left
the
islet
the
stepping
stones
were
slippery
with
water
and
his
moccasins
soon
became
soaked
again
but
he
forgot
the
cold
and
wet
in
that
ferocious
hunger
the
attacks
of
which
became
more
violent
every
minute
he
was
hopeful
that
he
might
see
a
deer
or
even
a
squirrel
but
the
animals
themselves
were
likely
to
keep
under
cover
in
such
a
rain
he
expected
a
hard
hunt
and
it
would
be
attended
also
by
much
danger
these
woods
must
be
full
of
indians
but
he
thought
little
of
the
risk
his
hunger
was
taking
complete
possession
of
his
mind
he
was
realizing
now
that
one
might
want
a
thing
so
much
that
it
would
drive
away
all
other
thoughts
rifle
in
hand
ready
for
any
quick
shot
he
searched
hour
after
hour
through
the
woods
and
thickets
he
was
wet
bedraggled
and
as
fierce
as
a
famishing
panther
but
neither
skill
nor
instinct
guided
him
to
anything
the
rabbit
hid
in
his
burrow
the
squirrel
remained
in
his
hollow
tree
and
the
deer
did
not
leave
his
covert
henry
could
not
well
calculate
the
passage
of
time
it
seemed
so
fearfully
long
and
there
was
no
one
to
tell
him
but
he
judged
that
it
must
be
about
noon
and
his
temper
was
becoming
that
of
the
famished
panther
to
which
he
likened
himself
he
paused
and
looked
around
the
circle
of
the
dripping
woods
he
had
retained
his
idea
of
direction
and
he
knew
that
he
could
go
straight
back
to
the
hut
in
the
swamp
but
he
had
no
idea
of
returning
now
a
power
that
neither
he
nor
anyone
else
could
resist
was
pushing
him
on
his
search
searching
the
gloomy
horizon
again
he
saw
against
the
dark
sky
a
thin
and
darker
line
that
he
knew
to
be
smoke
he
inferred
also
with
certainty
that
it
came
from
an
indian
camp
and
without
hesitation
turned
his
course
toward
it
indian
camp
though
it
might
be
and
containing
the
deadliest
of
foes
he
was
glad
to
know
something
lived
beside
himself
in
this
wilderness
he
approached
with
great
caution
and
found
his
surmise
to
be
correct
lying
full
length
in
a
wet
thicket
he
saw
a
party
of
about
twenty
he
took
them
to
an
oak
opening
they
had
erected
bark
shelters
they
had
good
fires
and
they
were
cooking
he
saw
them
roasting
the
strips
over
the
meat
venison
squirrel
rabbit
the
odor
so
pleasant
at
other
times
assailed
his
nostrils
but
it
was
now
only
a
taunt
and
a
torment
it
aroused
every
possible
pang
of
hunger
and
every
one
of
them
stabbed
like
a
knife
the
warriors
so
secure
in
their
forest
isolation
kept
no
sentinels
and
they
were
enjoying
themselves
like
men
who
had
everything
they
wanted
henry
could
hear
them
laughing
and
talking
and
he
watched
them
as
they
ate
strip
after
strip
of
the
delicate
tender
meat
with
the
wonderful
appetite
that
the
indian
has
after
long
fasting
a
fierce
unreasoning
anger
and
jealousy
laid
hold
of
him
he
was
starving
and
they
rejoiced
in
plenty
only
fifty
yards
away
he
began
to
form
plans
for
a
piratical
incursion
upon
them
half
the
body
of
a
deer
lay
near
the
edge
of
the
opening
he
would
rush
upon
it
seize
it
and
dart
away
it
might
be
possible
to
escape
with
such
spoil
then
he
recalled
his
prudence
such
a
thing
was
impossible
the
whole
band
of
warriors
would
be
upon
him
in
an
instant
the
best
thing
that
he
could
do
was
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
so
much
luxury
in
which
he
could
not
share
and
he
crept
away
among
the
bushes
wondering
what
he
could
do
to
drive
away
those
terrible
pains
his
vigorous
system
was
crying
louder
than
ever
for
the
food
that
would
sustain
it
his
eyes
were
burning
a
little
too
brightly
and
his
face
was
touched
with
fever
henry
stopped
once
to
catch
a
last
glimpse
of
the
fires
and
the
feasting
indians
under
the
bark
shelters
he
saw
a
warrior
raise
a
bone
grasping
it
in
both
hands
and
bite
deep
into
the
tender
flesh
that
clothed
it
the
sight
inflamed
him
into
an
anger
almost
uncontrollable
he
clenched
his
fist
and
shook
it
at
the
warrior
who
little
suspected
the
proximity
of
a
hatred
so
intense
then
he
bent
his
head
down
and
rushed
away
among
the
wet
bushes
which
in
rebuke
at
his
lack
of
caution
raked
him
across
the
face
henry
walked
despondently
back
toward
the
islet
in
the
swamp
the
aspect
of
air
and
sky
had
not
changed
the
heavens
still
dripped
icy
water
and
there
was
no
ray
of
cheerfulness
anywhere
the
game
remained
well
hidden
it
was
a
long
journey
back
and
as
he
felt
that
he
was
growing
weak
he
made
no
haste
he
came
to
dense
clumps
of
bushes
and
plowing
his
way
through
them
he
saw
a
dark
opening
under
some
trees
thrown
down
by
an
old
hurricane
having
some
vague
idea
that
it
might
be
the
lair
of
a
wild
animal
he
thrust
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
into
the
darkness
it
touched
a
soft
substance
there
was
a
growl
and
a
black
form
shot
out
almost
into
his
face
henry
sprang
aside
and
in
an
instant
all
his
powers
and
faculties
returned
he
had
stirred
up
a
black
bear
and
before
the
animal
frightened
as
much
as
he
was
enraged
could
run
far
the
boy
careless
how
many
indians
might
hear
threw
up
his
rifle
and
fired
his
aim
was
good
the
bear
shot
through
the
head
fell
and
was
dead
henry
transformed
ran
up
to
him
bear
life
had
been
given
up
to
sustain
man
here
was
food
for
many
days
and
he
rejoiced
with
a
great
joy
he
did
not
now
envy
those
warriors
back
there
the
bear
although
small
was
very
fat
evidently
he
had
fed
well
on
acorns
and
wild
honey
and
he
would
yield
up
steaks
which
to
one
with
henry
appetite
would
be
beyond
compare
he
calculated
that
it
was
more
than
a
mile
to
the
swamp
and
after
a
few
preliminaries
he
flung
the
body
of
the
bear
over
his
shoulder
through
some
power
of
the
mind
over
the
body
his
full
strength
had
returned
to
him
miraculously
and
when
he
reached
the
stepping
stones
he
crossed
from
one
to
another
lightly
and
firmly
despite
the
weight
that
he
carried
he
came
to
the
little
bark
hut
which
he
now
considered
his
own
the
night
had
fallen
again
but
some
coals
still
glowed
under
the
ashes
and
there
was
plenty
of
dry
wood
he
did
everything
decently
and
in
order
he
took
the
pelt
from
the
bear
carved
the
body
properly
and
then
just
as
the
indians
had
done
he
broiled
strips
over
the
coals
he
ate
them
one
after
another
slowly
and
tasting
all
the
savor
and
intense
as
was
the
mere
physical
pleasure
it
was
mingled
with
a
deep
thankfulness
not
only
was
the
life
nourished
anew
in
him
but
he
would
now
regain
the
strength
to
seek
his
comrades
when
he
had
eaten
enough
he
fastened
the
body
of
the
bear
now
in
several
portions
on
hooks
high
upon
the
walls
hooks
which
evidently
had
been
placed
there
by
the
former
owner
of
the
hut
for
this
very
purpose
then
sure
that
the
savor
of
the
food
would
draw
other
wild
animals
he
brought
one
of
the
stepping
stones
and
placed
it
on
the
inside
of
the
door
the
door
could
not
be
pushed
aside
without
arousing
him
and
secure
in
the
knowledge
he
went
to
sleep
before
the
coals
chapter
iv
the
red
chiefs
henry
awoke
only
once
and
that
was
about
half
way
between
midnight
and
morning
when
his
senses
never
still
entirely
even
in
sleep
warned
him
that
something
was
at
the
door
he
rose
cautiously
upon
his
arm
saw
a
dark
muzzle
at
the
crevice
and
behind
it
a
pair
of
yellow
gleaming
eyes
he
knew
at
once
that
it
was
a
panther
probably
living
in
the
swamp
and
drawn
by
the
food
it
must
be
very
hungry
to
dare
thus
the
smell
of
man
henry
hand
moved
slowly
to
the
end
of
a
stick
the
other
end
of
which
was
a
glowing
coal
then
he
seized
it
and
hurled
it
directly
at
the
inquisitive
head
the
hot
end
of
the
stick
struck
squarely
between
the
yellow
eyes
there
was
a
yelp
of
pain
and
the
boy
heard
the
rapid
pad
of
the
big
feet
as
it
fled
into
the
swamp
then
he
turned
over
on
his
side
and
laughed
in
genuine
pleasure
at
what
was
to
him
a
true
forest
joke
he
knew
the
panther
would
not
come
at
least
not
while
he
was
in
the
hut
and
he
calmly
closed
his
eyes
once
more
the
old
henry
was
himself
again
he
awoke
in
the
morning
to
find
that
the
cold
rain
was
still
falling
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
had
prepared
to
rain
forever
but
he
was
resolved
nevertheless
now
that
he
had
food
and
the
strength
that
food
brings
to
begin
the
search
for
his
comrades
the
islet
in
the
swamp
would
serve
as
his
could
be
he
would
never
cease
until
he
found
them
or
discovered
what
had
become
of
them
a
little
spring
of
cold
water
flowed
from
the
edge
of
the
islet
to
lose
itself
quickly
in
the
swamp
henry
drank
there
after
his
breakfast
and
then
felt
as
strong
and
active
as
ever
as
he
knew
the
mind
may
triumph
over
the
body
but
the
mind
can
not
save
the
body
without
food
then
he
made
his
precious
bear
meat
secure
against
the
prowling
panther
or
others
of
his
kind
tying
it
on
hanging
boughs
too
high
for
a
jump
and
too
slender
to
support
the
weight
of
a
large
animal
this
task
finished
quickly
he
left
the
swamp
and
returned
toward
the
spot
where
lie
had
seen
the
mohawks
the
falling
rain
and
the
somber
clouds
helped
henry
in
a
way
as
the
whole
forest
was
enveloped
in
a
sort
of
gloom
and
he
was
less
likely
to
be
seen
but
when
he
had
gone
about
half
the
distance
he
heard
indians
signaling
to
one
another
and
burying
himself
as
usual
in
the
wet
bushes
he
saw
two
small
groups
of
warriors
meet
and
talk
presently
they
separated
one
party
going
toward
the
east
and
the
other
toward
the
west
henry
thought
they
were
out
hunting
as
the
indians
usually
took
little
care
of
the
morrow
eating
all
their
food
in
a
few
days
no
matter
how
great
the
supply
might
be
when
he
drew
near
the
place
he
saw
three
more
indians
and
these
were
traveling
directly
south
he
was
quite
sure
now
that
his
theory
was
correct
they
were
sending
out
hunters
in
every
direction
in
order
that
they
might
beat
up
the
woods
thoroughly
for
game
and
his
own
position
anywhere
except
on
the
islet
was
becoming
exceedingly
precarious
nevertheless
using
all
his
wonderful
skill
he
continued
the
hunt
he
had
an
abiding
faith
that
his
four
comrades
were
yet
alive
and
he
meant
to
prove
it
in
the
afternoon
the
clouds
moved
away
a
little
and
the
rain
decreased
though
it
did
not
cease
the
indian
signs
multiplied
and
henry
felt
sure
that
the
forest
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
of
his
islet
contained
more
than
one
camp
some
great
gathering
must
be
in
progress
and
the
hunters
were
out
to
supply
it
with
food
four
times
he
heard
the
sound
of
shots
and
thrice
more
he
saw
warriors
passing
through
the
forest
once
a
wounded
deer
darted
past
him
and
lying
down
in
the
bushes
he
saw
the
indians
following
the
fleeing
animal
as
the
day
grew
older
the
trails
multiplied
certainly
a
formidable
gathering
of
bands
was
in
progress
and
feeling
that
he
might
at
any
time
be
caught
in
a
net
he
returned
to
the
islet
which
had
now
become
a
veritable
fort
for
him
it
was
not
quite
dark
when
he
arrived
and
he
found
all
as
it
had
been
except
the
tracks
of
two
panthers
under
the
boughs
to
which
he
had
fastened
the
big
pieces
of
bear
meat
henry
felt
a
malicious
satisfaction
at
the
disappointment
of
the
panthers
again
and
have
the
same
bad
luck
he
murmured
at
dusk
the
rain
ceased
entirely
and
he
prepared
for
a
journey
in
the
night
he
examined
his
powder
carefully
to
see
that
no
particle
of
it
was
wet
counted
the
bullets
in
his
pouch
and
then
examined
the
skies
there
was
a
little
moon
not
too
much
enough
to
show
him
the
way
but
not
enough
to
disclose
him
to
an
enemy
unless
very
near
then
he
left
the
islet
and
went
swiftly
through
the
forest
laying
his
course
a
third
time
toward
the
indian
camp
he
was
sure
now
that
all
the
hunters
had
returned
and
he
did
not
expect
the
necessity
of
making
any
stops
for
the
purpose
of
hiding
his
hopes
were
justified
and
as
he
drew
near
the
camp
he
became
aware
that
its
population
had
increased
greatly
it
was
proved
by
many
signs
new
trails
converged
upon
it
and
some
of
them
were
very
broad
indicating
that
many
warriors
had
passed
they
had
passed
too
in
perfect
confidence
as
there
was
no
effort
at
concealment
and
henry
surmised
that
no
white
force
of
any
size
could
be
within
many
days
march
of
this
place
but
the
very
security
of
the
indians
helped
his
own
design
they
would
not
dream
that
any
one
of
the
hated
race
was
daring
to
come
almost
within
the
light
of
their
fires
henry
had
but
one
fear
just
now
and
that
was
dogs
if
the
indians
had
any
of
their
mongrel
curs
with
them
they
would
quickly
scent
him
out
and
give
the
alarm
with
their
barking
but
he
believed
that
the
probabilities
were
against
it
this
so
he
thought
then
was
a
war
or
hunting
camp
and
it
was
likely
that
the
indians
would
leave
the
dogs
at
their
permanent
villages
at
any
rate
he
would
take
the
risk
and
he
drew
slowly
toward
the
oak
opening
where
some
indians
stood
about
beyond
them
in
another
dip
of
the
valley
was
a
wider
opening
which
he
had
not
seen
on
his
first
trip
and
this
contained
not
only
bark
shelters
but
buildings
that
indicated
a
permanent
village
the
second
and
larger
opening
was
filled
with
a
great
concourse
of
warriors
fortunately
the
foliage
around
the
opening
was
very
dense
many
trees
and
thickets
everywhere
henry
crept
to
the
very
rim
where
lying
in
the
blackest
of
the
shadows
and
well
hidden
himself
he
could
yet
see
nearly
everything
in
the
camp
the
men
were
not
eating
now
although
it
was
obvious
that
the
hunters
had
done
well
the
dressed
bodies
of
deer
and
bear
hung
in
the
bark
shelters
most
of
the
indians
sat
about
the
fires
and
it
seemed
to
henry
that
they
had
an
air
of
expectancy
at
least
two
hundred
were
present
and
all
of
them
were
in
war
paint
although
there
were
several
styles
of
paint
there
was
a
difference
in
appearance
too
in
the
warriors
and
henry
surmised
that
representatives
of
all
the
tribes
of
the
iroquois
were
there
coming
to
the
extreme
western
boundary
or
fringe
of
their
country
while
henry
watched
them
a
half
dozen
who
seemed
by
their
bearing
and
manner
to
be
chiefs
drew
together
at
a
point
not
far
from
him
and
talked
together
earnestly
now
and
then
they
looked
toward
the
forest
and
he
was
quite
sure
that
they
were
expecting
somebody
a
person
of
importance
he
became
deeply
interested
he
was
lying
in
a
dense
clump
of
hazel
bushes
flat
upon
his
stomach
his
face
raised
but
little
above
the
ground
he
would
have
been
hidden
from
the
keenest
eye
only
ten
feet
away
but
the
faces
of
the
chiefs
outlined
against
the
blazing
firelight
were
so
clearly
visible
to
him
that
he
could
see
every
change
of
expression
they
were
men
all
of
middle
age
tall
lean
their
noses
hooked
features
cut
clean
and
strong
and
their
heads
shaved
all
except
the
defiant
scalp
lock
into
which
the
feather
of
an
eagle
was
twisted
their
bodies
were
draped
in
fine
red
or
blue
blankets
and
they
wore
leggins
and
moccasins
of
beautifully
tanned
deerskin
they
ceased
talking
presently
and
henry
heard
a
distant
wailing
note
from
the
west
some
one
in
the
camp
replied
with
a
cry
in
kind
and
then
a
silence
fell
upon
them
all
the
chiefs
stood
erect
looking
toward
the
west
henry
knew
that
he
whom
they
expected
was
at
hand
the
cry
was
repeated
but
much
nearer
and
a
warrior
leaped
into
the
opening
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
firelight
he
was
entirely
naked
save
for
a
breech
cloth
and
moccasins
and
he
was
a
wild
and
savage
figure
he
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
then
faced
the
chiefs
and
bowing
before
them
spoke
a
few
words
in
the
wyandot
knew
already
by
his
paint
that
he
was
a
wyandot
the
chiefs
inclined
their
heads
gravely
and
the
herald
turning
leaped
back
into
the
forest
in
two
or
three
minutes
six
men
including
the
herald
emerged
from
the
woods
and
henry
moved
a
little
when
he
saw
the
first
of
the
six
all
of
whom
were
wyandots
it
was
timmendiquas
head
chief
of
the
wyandots
and
henry
had
never
seen
him
more
splendid
in
manner
and
bearing
than
he
was
as
he
thus
met
the
representatives
of
the
famous
six
nations
small
though
the
wyandot
tribe
might
be
mighty
was
its
valor
and
fame
and
white
lightning
met
the
great
iroquois
only
as
an
equal
in
his
heart
a
superior
it
was
an
extraordinary
thing
but
henry
at
this
very
moment
burrowing
in
the
earth
that
he
might
not
lose
his
life
at
the
hands
of
either
was
an
ardent
partisan
of
timmendiquas
it
was
the
young
wyandot
chief
whom
he
wished
to
be
first
to
make
the
greatest
impression
and
he
was
pleased
when
he
heard
the
low
hum
of
admiration
go
round
the
circle
of
two
hundred
savage
warriors
it
was
seldom
indeed
perhaps
never
that
the
iroquois
had
looked
upon
such
a
man
as
timmendiquas
timmendiquas
and
his
companions
advanced
slowly
toward
the
chiefs
and
the
wyandot
overtopped
all
the
iroquois
henry
could
tell
by
the
manner
of
the
chiefs
that
the
reputation
of
the
famous
white
lightning
had
preceded
him
and
that
they
had
already
found
fact
equal
to
report
the
chiefs
timmendiquas
among
them
sat
down
on
logs
before
the
fire
and
all
the
warriors
withdrew
to
a
respectful
distance
where
they
stood
and
watched
in
silence
the
oldest
chief
took
his
long
pipe
beautifully
carved
and
shaped
like
a
trumpet
and
filled
it
with
tobacco
which
he
lighted
with
a
coal
from
the
fire
then
he
took
two
or
three
whiffs
and
passed
the
pipe
to
timmendiquas
who
did
the
same
every
chief
smoked
the
pipe
and
then
they
sat
still
waiting
in
silence
henry
was
so
much
absorbed
in
this
scene
which
was
at
once
a
spectacle
and
a
drama
that
he
almost
forgot
where
he
was
and
that
he
was
an
enemy
he
wondered
now
at
their
silence
if
this
was
a
council
surely
they
would
discuss
whatever
question
had
brought
them
there
but
he
was
soon
enlightened
that
low
far
cry
came
again
but
from
the
east
it
was
answered
as
before
from
the
camp
and
in
three
or
four
minutes
a
warrior
sprang
from
the
forest
into
the
opening
like
the
first
he
was
naked
except
for
the
breech
cloth
and
moccasins
the
chiefs
rose
at
his
coming
received
his
salute
gravely
and
returned
it
as
gravely
then
he
returned
to
the
forest
and
all
waited
in
the
splendid
calm
of
the
indian
curiosity
pricked
henry
like
a
nettle
who
was
coming
now
it
must
be
some
man
of
great
importance
or
they
would
not
wait
so
silently
there
was
the
same
air
of
expectancy
that
had
preceded
the
arrival
of
timmendiquas
all
the
warriors
looked
toward
the
eastern
wall
of
the
forest
and
henry
looked
the
same
way
presently
the
black
foliage
parted
and
a
man
stepped
forth
followed
at
a
little
distance
by
seven
or
eight
others
the
stranger
although
tall
was
not
equal
in
height
to
timmendiquas
but
he
too
had
a
lofty
and
splendid
presence
and
it
was
evident
to
anyone
versed
at
all
in
forest
lore
that
here
was
a
great
chief
he
was
lean
but
sinewy
and
he
moved
with
great
ease
and
grace
he
reminded
henry
of
a
powerful
panther
he
was
dressed
after
the
manner
of
famous
chiefs
with
the
utmost
care
his
short
military
coat
of
fine
blue
cloth
bore
a
silver
epaulet
on
either
shoulder
his
head
was
not
bare
disclosing
the
scalp
lock
like
those
of
the
other
indians
it
was
covered
instead
with
a
small
hat
of
felt
round
and
laced
hanging
carelessly
over
one
shoulder
was
a
blanket
of
blue
cloth
with
a
red
border
at
his
side
from
a
belt
of
blue
leather
swung
a
small
sword
his
leggins
were
of
superfine
blue
cloth
and
his
moccasins
of
deerskin
both
were
trimmed
with
small
beads
of
many
colors
the
new
chief
advanced
into
the
opening
amid
the
dead
silence
that
still
held
all
and
timmendiquas
stepped
forward
to
meet
him
these
two
held
the
gaze
of
everyone
and
what
they
and
they
alone
did
had
become
of
surpassing
interest
each
was
haughty
fully
aware
of
his
own
dignity
and
importance
but
they
met
half
way
looked
intently
for
a
moment
or
two
into
the
eyes
of
each
other
and
then
saluted
gravely
all
at
once
henry
knew
the
stranger
he
had
never
seen
him
before
but
his
impressive
reception
and
the
mixture
of
military
and
savage
attire
revealed
him
this
could
be
none
other
than
the
great
mohawk
war
chief
thayendanegea
the
brant
of
the
white
men
terrible
name
on
the
border
henry
gazed
at
him
eagerly
from
his
covert
etching
his
features
forever
on
his
memory
his
face
lean
and
strong
was
molded
much
like
that
of
timmendiquas
and
like
the
wyandot
he
was
young
under
thirty
timmendiquas
and
was
truly
to
the
fire
and
once
again
the
pipe
was
smoked
by
all
the
two
young
chiefs
received
the
seats
of
favor
and
others
sat
about
them
but
they
were
not
the
only
great
chiefs
present
though
all
yielded
first
place
to
them
because
of
their
character
and
exploits
henry
was
not
mistaken
in
his
guess
that
this
was
an
important
council
although
its
extent
exceeded
even
his
surmise
delegates
and
head
chiefs
of
all
the
six
nations
were
present
to
confer
with
the
warlike
wyandots
of
the
west
who
had
come
so
far
east
to
meet
them
thayendanegea
was
the
great
war
chief
of
the
mohawks
but
not
their
titular
chief
the
latter
was
an
older
man
two
voices
who
sat
beside
the
younger
the
other
chiefs
were
the
onondaga
the
entangled
the
oneida
bearing
a
quiver
the
cayuga
he
who
looks
both
ways
the
seneca
beautiful
lake
and
the
tuscarora
encircling
and
holding
up
a
tree
the
names
were
hereditary
and
because
in
a
dim
past
they
had
formed
the
great
confederacy
the
onondagas
were
first
in
the
council
and
were
also
the
high
priests
and
titular
head
of
the
six
nations
but
the
mohawks
were
first
war
path
all
the
six
nations
were
divided
into
clans
and
every
clan
camping
in
its
proper
place
was
represented
at
this
meeting
henry
had
heard
much
at
pittsburgh
of
the
six
nations
their
wonderful
league
and
their
wonderful
history
he
knew
that
according
to
the
legend
the
league
had
been
formed
by
hiawatha
an
onondaga
he
was
opposed
in
this
plan
by
tododaho
then
head
chief
of
the
onondagas
but
he
went
to
the
mohawks
and
gained
the
support
of
their
great
chief
dekanawidah
with
his
aid
the
league
was
formed
and
the
solemn
agreement
never
broken
was
made
at
the
onondaga
lake
now
they
were
a
perfect
little
state
with
fifty
chiefs
or
including
the
head
chiefs
some
of
these
details
henry
was
to
learn
later
he
was
also
to
learn
many
of
the
words
that
the
chiefs
said
through
a
source
of
which
he
little
dreamed
at
the
present
yet
he
divined
much
of
it
from
the
meeting
of
the
fiery
wyandots
with
the
highly
developed
and
warlike
power
of
the
six
nations
thayendanegea
was
talking
now
and
timmendiquas
silent
and
grave
was
listening
the
mohawk
approached
his
subject
indirectly
through
the
trope
allegory
and
simile
that
the
indian
loved
he
talked
of
the
unseen
deities
that
ruled
the
life
of
the
iroquois
through
mystic
dreams
he
spoke
of
the
trees
the
rocks
and
the
animals
all
of
which
to
the
iroquois
had
souls
he
called
on
the
name
of
the
great
spirit
which
was
aieroski
before
it
became
manitou
the
great
spirit
who
in
the
iroquois
belief
had
only
the
size
of
a
dwarf
because
his
soul
was
so
mighty
that
he
did
not
need
body
land
is
ours
the
land
of
your
people
and
mine
oh
chief
of
the
brave
wyandots
he
said
to
timmendiquas
there
was
no
land
only
the
waters
but
aieroski
raised
the
land
of
konspioni
above
the
foam
then
he
sowed
five
handfuls
of
red
seed
in
it
and
from
those
handfuls
grew
the
five
nations
later
grew
up
the
tuscaroras
who
have
joined
us
and
other
tribes
of
our
race
like
yours
great
chief
of
the
brave
timmendiquas
still
said
nothing
he
did
not
allow
an
eyelid
to
flicker
at
this
assumption
of
superiority
for
the
six
nations
over
all
other
tribes
a
great
warrior
he
was
a
great
politician
also
and
he
wished
to
unite
the
iroquois
in
a
firm
league
with
the
tribes
of
the
ohio
valley
the
coals
from
the
great
fire
glowed
and
threw
out
an
intense
heat
thayendanegea
unbuttoned
his
military
coat
and
threw
it
back
revealing
a
bare
bronze
chest
upon
which
was
painted
the
device
of
the
mohawks
a
flint
and
steel
the
chests
of
the
onondaga
cayuga
and
seneca
head
chiefs
were
also
bared
to
the
glow
the
device
on
the
chest
of
the
onondaga
was
a
cabin
on
top
of
a
hill
the
caytiga
was
a
great
pipe
and
the
figure
of
a
mountain
adorned
the
seneca
bronze
have
had
the
messages
that
you
have
sent
to
us
timmendiquas
said
thayendanegea
they
are
good
in
the
eyes
of
our
people
the
rotinonsionni
the
mohawks
they
please
too
the
ancient
tribe
the
kannoseone
the
onondagas
the
valiant
hotinonsionni
the
senecas
and
all
our
brethren
of
the
six
nations
all
the
land
from
the
salt
water
to
the
setting
sun
was
given
to
the
red
men
by
aieroski
but
if
we
do
not
defend
it
we
can
not
keep
is
so
said
timmendiquas
speaking
for
the
first
time
have
fought
them
on
the
ohio
and
in
where
they
come
with
their
rifles
and
axes
the
whole
might
of
the
wyandots
the
shawnees
the
miamis
the
illinois
the
delawares
and
the
ottawas
has
gone
forth
against
them
we
have
slain
many
of
them
but
we
have
failed
to
drive
them
back
now
we
have
come
to
ask
the
six
nations
to
press
down
upon
them
in
the
east
with
all
your
power
while
we
do
the
same
in
the
west
surely
then
your
aieroski
and
our
manitou
who
are
the
same
will
not
refuse
us
the
eyes
of
thayendanegea
glistened
speak
well
timmendiquas
he
said
the
red
men
must
unite
to
fight
for
the
land
of
konspioni
which
aieroski
raised
above
the
sea
and
we
be
two
you
and
i
timmendiquas
fit
to
lead
them
to
is
so
said
timmendiquas
gravely
chapter
the
iroquois
town
henry
lay
fully
an
hour
in
the
bushes
he
had
forgotten
about
the
dogs
that
he
dreaded
but
evidently
he
was
right
in
his
surmise
that
the
camp
contained
none
nothing
disturbed
him
while
he
stared
at
what
was
passing
by
the
firelight
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
meeting
of
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
portended
great
things
but
he
would
not
be
stirred
from
his
task
of
rescuing
his
comrades
or
discovering
their
fate
they
two
great
chiefs
sat
long
in
close
converse
men
chiefs
at
times
and
talked
with
them
but
these
two
proud
dominating
both
singularly
handsome
men
of
the
indian
type
were
always
there
henry
was
almost
ready
to
steal
away
when
he
saw
a
new
figure
approaching
the
two
chiefs
the
walk
and
bearing
of
the
stranger
were
familiar
and
henry
knew
him
even
before
his
face
was
lighted
tip
by
the
fire
it
was
braxton
wyatt
the
renegade
who
had
escaped
the
great
battles
on
both
the
ohio
and
the
mississippi
and
who
was
here
with
the
iroquois
ready
to
do
to
his
own
race
all
the
evil
that
he
could
henry
felt
a
shudder
of
repulsion
deeper
than
any
indian
could
inspire
in
him
they
fought
for
their
own
land
and
their
own
people
but
braxton
wyatt
had
violated
everything
that
an
honest
man
should
hold
sacred
henry
on
the
whole
was
not
surprised
to
see
him
such
a
chance
was
sure
to
draw
braxton
wyatt
moreover
the
war
so
far
as
it
pertained
to
the
border
seemed
to
be
sweeping
toward
the
northeast
and
it
bore
many
stormy
petrels
upon
its
crest
he
watched
wyatt
as
he
walked
toward
one
of
the
fires
there
the
renegade
sat
down
and
talked
with
the
warriors
apparently
on
the
best
of
terms
he
was
presently
joined
by
two
more
renegades
whom
henry
recognized
as
blackstaffe
and
quarles
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
rose
after
a
while
and
walked
toward
the
center
of
the
camp
where
several
of
the
bark
shelters
had
been
enclosed
entirely
henry
judged
that
one
had
been
set
apart
for
each
but
they
were
lost
from
his
view
when
they
passed
within
the
circling
ring
of
warriors
henry
believed
that
the
iroquois
and
wyandots
would
form
a
fortified
camp
here
a
place
from
which
they
would
make
sudden
and
terrible
forays
upon
the
settlements
he
based
his
opinion
upon
the
good
location
and
the
great
number
of
saplings
that
had
been
cut
down
already
they
would
build
strong
lodges
and
then
a
palisade
around
them
with
the
saplings
he
was
speedily
confirmed
in
this
opinion
when
he
saw
warriors
come
to
the
forest
with
hatchets
and
begin
to
cut
down
more
saplings
he
knew
then
that
it
was
time
to
go
as
a
wood
chopper
might
blunder
upon
him
at
any
time
he
slipped
from
his
covert
and
was
quickly
gone
in
the
forest
his
limbs
were
somewhat
stiff
from
lying
so
long
in
one
position
but
that
soon
wore
away
and
he
was
comparatively
fresh
when
he
came
once
more
to
the
islet
in
the
swamp
a
good
moon
was
now
shining
tipping
the
forest
with
a
fine
silvery
gray
and
henry
purveyed
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
the
simple
little
shelter
that
he
had
found
so
opportunely
it
was
a
good
house
too
good
to
such
a
son
of
the
deepest
forest
as
was
henry
it
was
made
of
nothing
but
bark
and
poles
but
it
had
kept
out
all
that
long
penetrating
rain
of
the
last
three
or
four
days
and
when
he
lifted
the
big
stone
aside
and
opened
the
door
it
seemed
as
snug
a
place
as
he
could
have
wished
he
left
the
door
open
a
little
lighted
a
small
fire
on
the
flat
stones
having
no
fear
that
it
would
be
seen
through
the
dense
curtain
that
shut
him
in
and
broiled
big
bear
steaks
on
the
coals
when
he
had
eaten
and
the
fire
had
died
he
went
out
and
sat
beside
the
hut
he
was
well
satisfied
with
the
day
work
and
he
wished
now
to
think
with
all
the
concentration
that
one
must
put
upon
a
great
task
if
he
expects
to
achieve
it
he
intended
to
invade
the
indian
camp
and
he
knew
full
well
that
it
was
the
most
perilous
enterprise
that
he
had
ever
attempted
yet
scouts
and
hunters
had
done
such
things
and
had
escaped
with
their
lives
he
must
not
shrink
from
the
path
that
others
had
trodden
he
made
up
his
mind
firmly
and
partly
thought
out
his
plan
of
operations
then
he
rested
and
so
sanguine
was
his
temperament
that
he
began
to
regard
the
deed
itself
as
almost
achieved
decision
is
always
soothing
after
doubt
and
he
fell
into
a
pleasant
dreamy
state
a
gentle
wind
was
blowing
the
forest
was
dry
and
the
leaves
rustled
with
the
low
note
that
is
like
the
softest
chord
of
a
violin
it
became
penetrating
thrillingly
sweet
and
hark
it
spoke
to
him
in
a
voice
that
he
knew
it
was
the
same
voice
that
he
had
heard
on
the
ohio
mystic
but
telling
him
to
be
of
heart
and
courage
he
would
triumph
over
hardships
and
dangers
and
he
would
see
his
friends
again
henry
started
up
from
his
vision
the
song
was
gone
and
he
heard
only
the
wind
softly
moving
the
leaves
it
had
been
vague
and
shadowy
as
gossamer
light
as
the
substance
of
a
dream
but
it
was
real
to
him
nevertheless
and
the
deep
glow
of
certain
triumph
permeated
his
being
body
and
mind
it
was
not
strange
that
he
had
in
his
nature
something
of
the
indian
mysticism
that
personified
the
winds
and
the
trees
and
everything
about
him
the
manitou
of
the
red
man
and
the
ancient
aieroski
of
the
iroquois
were
the
same
as
his
own
god
he
could
not
doubt
that
he
had
a
message
down
on
the
ohio
he
had
had
the
same
message
more
than
once
and
it
had
always
come
true
he
heard
a
slight
rustling
among
the
bushes
and
sitting
perfectly
still
he
saw
a
black
bear
emerge
into
the
open
it
had
gained
the
islet
in
some
manner
probably
floundering
through
the
black
mire
and
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
the
mate
of
the
one
he
had
slain
drawn
perhaps
by
instinct
on
the
trail
of
a
lost
comrade
he
could
have
shot
the
bear
as
he
he
would
need
fresh
supplies
of
food
he
did
not
have
the
heart
to
do
it
the
bear
sniffed
a
little
at
the
wind
which
was
blowing
the
human
odor
away
from
him
and
sat
back
on
his
haunches
henry
did
not
believe
that
the
animal
had
seen
him
or
was
yet
aware
of
his
presence
although
he
might
suspect
there
was
something
humorous
and
also
pathetic
in
the
visitor
who
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
about
him
he
made
a
distinct
appeal
to
henry
who
sat
absolutely
still
so
still
that
the
little
bear
could
not
be
sure
at
first
that
he
was
a
human
being
a
minute
passed
and
the
red
eye
of
the
bear
rested
upon
the
boy
henry
felt
pleasant
and
sociable
but
he
knew
that
he
could
retain
friendly
relations
only
by
remaining
quiet
i
have
eaten
your
comrade
my
friend
he
said
to
himself
is
only
because
of
hard
the
bear
little
comic
and
yet
with
that
touch
of
pathos
about
him
cocked
his
head
a
little
further
over
on
one
side
and
as
a
silver
shaft
of
moonlight
fell
upon
him
henry
could
see
one
red
eye
gleaming
it
was
a
singular
fact
but
the
boy
alone
in
the
wilderness
and
the
loser
of
his
comrades
felt
for
the
moment
a
sense
of
comradeship
with
the
bear
which
was
also
alone
and
doubtless
the
loser
of
a
comrade
also
he
uttered
a
soft
growling
sound
like
the
satisfied
purr
of
a
bear
eating
its
food
the
comical
bear
rose
a
little
higher
on
his
hind
paws
and
looked
in
astonishment
at
the
motionless
figure
that
uttered
sounds
so
familiar
yet
the
figure
was
not
familiar
he
had
never
seen
a
human
being
before
and
the
shape
and
outline
were
very
strange
to
him
it
might
be
some
new
kind
of
animal
and
he
was
disposed
to
be
inquiring
because
there
was
nothing
in
these
forests
which
the
black
bear
was
afraid
of
until
man
came
he
advanced
a
step
or
two
and
growled
gently
then
he
reared
up
again
on
his
hind
paws
and
cocked
his
held
to
one
side
in
his
amusing
manner
henry
still
motionless
smiled
at
him
here
for
an
instant
at
least
was
a
cheery
visitor
and
companionship
he
at
least
would
not
break
the
spell
look
almost
as
if
you
could
talk
old
fellow
he
said
to
himself
if
i
knew
your
language
i
ask
you
a
lot
of
the
bear
too
was
motionless
now
torn
by
doubt
and
curiosity
it
certainly
was
a
singular
figure
that
sat
there
fifteen
or
twenty
yards
before
him
and
he
had
the
most
intense
curiosity
to
solve
the
mystery
of
this
creature
but
caution
held
him
back
there
was
a
sudden
flaw
in
the
light
breeze
it
shifted
about
and
brought
the
dreadful
man
odor
to
the
nostrils
of
the
honest
black
bear
it
was
something
entirely
new
to
him
but
it
contained
the
quality
of
fear
that
still
strange
figure
was
his
deadliest
foe
dropping
down
upon
his
four
paws
he
fled
among
the
trees
and
then
scrambled
somehow
through
the
swamp
to
the
mainland
henry
sighed
despite
his
own
friendly
feeling
the
bear
warned
by
instinct
was
afraid
of
him
and
as
he
was
bound
to
acknowledge
to
himself
the
bear
instinct
was
doubtless
right
he
rose
went
into
the
hut
and
slept
heavily
through
the
night
in
the
morning
he
left
the
islet
once
more
to
scout
in
the
direction
of
the
indian
camp
but
he
found
it
a
most
dangerous
task
the
woods
were
full
of
warriors
hunting
as
he
had
judged
the
game
was
abundant
and
he
heard
rifles
cracking
in
several
directions
he
loitered
therefore
in
the
thickest
of
the
thickets
willing
to
wait
until
night
came
for
his
enterprise
it
was
advisable
moreover
to
wait
because
he
did
not
see
yet
just
how
he
was
going
to
succeed
he
spent
nearly
the
whole
day
shifting
here
and
there
through
the
forest
but
late
in
the
afternoon
as
the
indians
yet
seemed
so
numerous
in
the
woods
he
concluded
to
go
back
toward
the
islet
he
was
about
two
miles
from
the
swamp
when
he
heard
a
cry
sharp
but
distant
it
was
that
of
the
savages
and
henry
instinctively
divined
the
cause
a
party
of
the
warriors
had
come
somehow
upon
his
trail
and
they
would
surely
follow
it
it
was
a
mischance
that
he
had
not
expected
he
waited
a
minute
or
two
and
then
heard
the
cry
again
but
nearer
he
knew
that
it
would
come
no
more
but
it
confirmed
him
in
his
first
opinion
henry
had
little
fear
of
being
caught
as
the
islet
was
so
securely
hidden
but
he
did
not
wish
to
take
even
a
remote
chance
of
its
discovery
hence
he
ran
to
the
eastward
of
it
intending
as
the
darkness
came
hiding
his
trail
to
double
back
and
regain
the
hut
he
proceeded
at
a
long
easy
gait
his
mind
not
troubled
by
the
pursuit
it
was
to
him
merely
an
incident
that
should
be
ended
as
soon
as
possible
annoying
perhaps
but
easily
cured
so
he
swung
lightly
along
stopping
at
intervals
among
the
bushes
to
see
if
any
of
the
warriors
had
drawn
near
but
he
detected
nothing
now
and
then
he
looked
up
to
the
sky
willing
that
night
should
end
this
matter
quickly
and
peacefully
his
wish
seemed
near
fulfillment
an
uncommonly
brilliant
sun
was
setting
the
whole
west
was
a
sea
of
red
and
yellow
fire
but
in
the
east
the
forest
was
already
sinking
into
the
dark
he
turned
now
and
went
back
toward
the
west
on
a
line
parallel
with
the
pursuit
but
much
closer
to
the
swamp
the
dusk
thickened
rapidly
the
sun
dropped
over
the
curve
of
the
world
and
the
vast
complex
maze
of
trunks
and
boughs
melted
into
a
solid
black
wall
the
incident
of
the
pursuit
was
over
and
with
it
its
petty
annoyances
he
directed
his
course
boldly
now
for
the
stepping
stones
and
traveled
fast
soon
the
first
of
them
would
be
less
than
a
hundred
yards
away
but
the
incident
was
not
over
wary
and
skillful
though
the
young
forest
runner
might
be
he
had
made
one
miscalculation
and
it
led
to
great
consequences
as
he
skirted
the
edge
of
the
swamp
in
the
darkness
now
fully
come
a
dusky
figure
suddenly
appeared
it
was
a
stray
warrior
from
some
small
band
wandering
about
at
will
the
meeting
was
probably
as
little
expected
by
him
as
it
was
by
henry
and
they
were
so
close
together
when
they
saw
each
other
that
neither
had
time
to
raise
his
rifle
the
warrior
a
tall
powerful
man
dropping
his
gun
and
snatching
out
a
knife
sprang
at
once
upon
his
enemy
henry
was
borne
back
by
the
weight
and
impact
but
making
an
immense
effort
he
recovered
himself
and
seizing
the
wrist
of
the
knife
hand
exerted
all
his
great
strength
the
warrior
wished
to
change
the
weapon
from
his
right
band
but
he
dared
not
let
go
with
the
other
lest
he
be
thrown
down
at
once
and
with
great
violence
his
first
rush
having
failed
he
was
now
at
a
disadvantage
as
the
indian
is
not
generally
a
wrestler
henry
pushed
him
back
and
his
hand
closed
tighter
and
tighter
around
the
red
wrist
he
wished
to
tear
the
knife
from
it
but
he
too
was
afraid
to
let
go
with
the
other
hand
and
so
the
two
remained
locked
fast
neither
uttered
a
cry
after
the
first
contact
and
the
only
sounds
in
the
dark
were
their
hard
breathing
which
turned
to
a
gasp
now
and
then
and
the
shuffle
of
their
feet
over
the
earth
henry
felt
that
it
must
end
soon
one
or
the
other
must
give
way
their
sinews
were
already
strained
to
the
cracking
point
and
making
a
supreme
effort
he
bore
all
his
weight
upon
the
warrior
who
unable
to
sustain
himself
went
down
with
the
youth
upon
him
the
indian
uttered
a
groan
and
henry
leaping
instantly
to
his
feet
looked
down
upon
his
fallen
antagonist
who
did
not
stir
he
knew
the
cause
as
they
fell
the
point
of
the
knife
bad
been
turned
upward
and
it
had
entered
the
heart
although
he
had
been
in
peril
at
his
hands
henry
looked
at
the
slain
man
in
a
sort
of
pity
he
had
not
wished
to
take
anyone
life
and
in
reality
he
had
not
been
the
direct
cause
of
it
but
it
was
a
stern
time
and
the
feeling
soon
passed
the
wyandot
for
such
he
was
by
his
paint
would
never
have
felt
a
particle
of
remorse
had
the
victory
been
his
the
moon
was
now
coming
out
and
henry
looked
down
thoughtfully
at
the
still
face
then
the
idea
came
to
him
in
fact
leaped
up
in
his
brain
with
such
an
impulse
that
it
carried
conviction
he
would
take
this
warrior
place
and
go
to
the
indian
camp
so
eager
was
he
and
so
full
of
his
plan
that
he
did
not
feel
any
repulsion
as
he
opened
the
warrior
deerskin
shirt
and
took
his
totem
from
a
place
near
his
heart
it
was
a
little
deerskin
bag
containing
a
bunch
of
red
feathers
this
was
his
charm
his
magic
spell
his
bringer
of
good
luck
which
had
failed
him
so
woefully
this
time
henry
not
without
a
touch
of
the
forest
belief
put
it
inside
his
own
hunting
shirt
wishing
although
he
laughed
at
himself
that
if
the
red
man
medicine
had
any
potency
it
should
be
on
his
own
side
then
he
found
also
the
little
bag
in
which
the
indian
carried
his
war
paint
and
the
feather
brush
with
which
he
put
it
on
the
next
hour
witnessed
a
singular
transformation
a
white
youth
was
turned
into
a
red
warrior
he
cut
his
own
hair
closely
all
except
a
tuft
in
the
center
with
his
sharp
hunting
knife
the
tuft
and
the
close
crop
he
stained
black
with
the
indian
paint
it
was
a
poor
black
but
he
hoped
that
it
would
pass
in
the
night
he
drew
the
tuft
into
a
scalplock
and
intertwined
it
with
a
feather
from
the
indian
own
tuft
then
he
stained
his
face
neck
hands
and
arms
with
the
red
paint
and
stood
forth
a
powerful
young
warrior
of
a
western
nation
he
hid
the
indian
weapons
and
his
own
cap
in
the
brush
then
he
took
the
body
of
the
fallen
warrior
to
the
edge
of
the
swamp
and
dropped
it
in
his
object
was
not
alone
concealment
but
burial
as
well
he
still
felt
sorry
for
the
unfortunate
wyandot
and
he
watched
him
until
he
sank
completely
from
sight
in
the
mire
then
he
turned
away
and
traveled
a
straight
course
toward
the
great
indian
camp
he
stopped
once
on
the
way
at
a
clear
pool
irradiated
by
the
bright
moonlight
and
looked
attentively
at
his
reflection
by
night
at
least
it
was
certainly
that
of
an
indian
and
summoning
all
his
confidence
he
continued
upon
his
chosen
and
desperate
task
henry
knew
that
the
chances
were
against
him
even
with
his
disguise
but
he
was
bound
to
enter
the
indian
camp
and
he
was
prepared
to
incur
all
risks
and
to
endure
all
penalties
he
even
felt
a
certain
lightness
of
heart
as
he
hurried
on
his
way
and
at
length
saw
through
the
forest
the
flare
of
light
from
the
indian
camp
he
approached
cautiously
at
first
in
order
that
he
might
take
a
good
look
into
the
camp
and
he
was
surprised
at
what
he
saw
in
a
single
day
the
village
had
been
enlarged
much
more
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
contained
at
least
twice
as
many
warriors
women
and
children
too
had
come
and
he
heard
a
stray
dog
barking
here
and
there
many
more
fires
than
usual
were
burning
and
there
was
a
great
murmur
of
voices
henry
was
much
taken
aback
at
first
it
seemed
that
he
was
about
to
plunge
into
the
midst
of
the
whole
iroquois
nation
and
at
a
time
too
when
something
of
extreme
importance
was
going
on
but
a
little
reflection
showed
that
he
was
fortunate
amid
so
many
people
and
so
much
ferment
it
was
not
at
all
likely
that
he
would
be
noticed
closely
it
was
his
intention
if
the
necessity
came
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
warrior
of
the
shawnee
tribe
who
had
wandered
far
eastward
but
he
meant
to
avoid
sedulously
the
eye
of
timmendiquas
who
might
through
his
size
and
stature
divine
his
identity
as
henry
lingered
at
the
edge
of
the
camp
in
indecision
whether
to
wait
a
little
or
plunge
boldly
into
the
light
of
the
fires
he
became
aware
that
all
sounds
in
the
such
it
was
instead
of
a
ceased
suddenly
except
the
light
tread
of
feet
and
the
sound
of
many
people
talking
low
he
saw
through
the
bushes
that
all
the
iroquois
and
with
them
the
detachment
of
wyandots
under
white
lightning
were
going
toward
a
large
structure
in
the
center
which
he
surmised
to
be
the
council
house
he
knew
from
his
experience
with
the
indians
farther
west
that
the
iroquois
built
such
structures
he
could
no
longer
doubt
that
some
ceremony
of
the
greatest
importance
was
about
to
begin
and
dismissing
indecision
he
left
the
bushes
and
entered
the
village
going
with
the
crowd
toward
the
great
pole
building
which
was
indeed
the
council
house
but
little
attention
was
paid
to
henry
he
would
have
drawn
none
at
all
had
it
not
been
for
his
height
and
when
a
warrior
or
two
glanced
at
him
he
uttered
some
words
in
shawnee
saying
that
he
had
wandered
far
and
was
glad
to
come
to
the
hospitable
iroquois
one
who
could
speak
a
little
shawnee
bade
him
welcome
and
they
went
on
satisfied
their
minds
more
intent
upon
the
ceremony
than
upon
a
visitor
the
council
house
built
of
light
poles
and
covered
with
poles
and
thatch
was
at
least
sixty
feet
long
and
about
thirty
feet
wide
with
a
large
door
on
the
eastern
side
and
one
or
two
smaller
ones
on
the
other
sides
as
henry
arrived
the
great
chiefs
and
of
the
iroquois
were
entering
the
building
and
about
it
were
grouped
many
warriors
and
women
and
even
children
but
all
preserved
a
decorous
solemnity
and
knowing
the
customs
of
the
forest
people
so
well
he
was
sure
that
the
ceremony
whatever
it
might
be
must
be
of
a
highly
sacred
nature
he
himself
drew
to
one
side
keeping
as
much
as
possible
in
the
shadow
but
he
was
using
to
its
utmost
power
every
faculty
of
observation
that
nature
had
given
him
many
of
the
fires
were
still
burning
but
the
moon
had
come
out
with
great
brightness
throwing
a
silver
light
over
the
whole
village
and
investing
with
attributes
that
savored
of
the
mystic
and
impressive
this
ceremony
held
by
a
savage
but
great
race
here
in
the
depths
of
the
primeval
forest
henry
was
about
to
witness
a
condoling
council
which
was
at
once
a
mourning
for
chiefs
who
had
fallen
in
battle
farther
east
with
his
own
people
and
the
election
and
welcome
of
their
successors
the
chiefs
presently
came
forth
from
the
council
house
or
as
it
was
more
generally
called
the
long
house
and
despite
the
greatness
of
thayendanegea
those
of
the
onondaga
tribe
in
virtue
of
their
ancient
and
undisputed
place
as
the
political
leaders
and
high
priests
of
the
six
nations
led
the
way
among
the
stately
onondaga
chiefs
were
atotarho
the
entangled
skanawati
beyond
the
river
tehatkahtons
looking
both
ways
tehayatkwarayen
red
wings
and
hahiron
the
scattered
they
were
men
of
stature
and
fine
countenance
proud
of
the
titular
primacy
that
belonged
to
them
because
it
was
the
onondaga
hiawatha
who
had
formed
the
great
confederacy
more
than
four
hundred
years
before
our
day
or
just
about
the
time
columbus
was
landing
on
the
shores
of
the
new
world
next
to
the
onondagas
came
the
fierce
and
warlike
mohawks
who
lived
nearest
to
albany
who
were
called
keepers
of
the
eastern
gate
and
who
were
fully
worthy
of
their
trust
they
were
content
that
the
onondagas
should
lead
in
council
so
long
as
they
were
first
in
battle
and
there
was
no
jealousy
between
them
among
their
chiefs
were
koswensiroutha
broad
shoulders
and
satekariwate
two
things
equal
third
in
rank
were
the
senecas
and
among
their
chiefs
were
kanokarih
the
threatened
and
kanyadariyo
beautiful
lake
these
three
the
onondagas
mohawks
and
senecas
were
esteemed
the
three
senior
nations
after
them
in
order
of
precedence
came
the
chiefs
of
the
three
junior
nations
the
oneidas
cayugas
and
tuscaroras
all
of
the
great
chiefs
had
assistant
chiefs
usually
relatives
who
in
case
of
death
often
succeeded
to
their
places
but
these
assistants
now
remained
in
the
crowd
with
other
minor
chiefs
and
the
mass
of
the
warriors
a
little
apart
stood
timmendiquas
and
his
wyandots
he
too
was
absorbed
in
the
ceremony
so
sacred
to
him
an
indian
and
he
did
not
notice
the
tall
figure
of
the
strange
shawnee
lingering
in
the
deepest
of
the
shadows
the
head
chiefs
walking
solemnly
and
never
speaking
marched
across
the
clearing
and
then
through
the
woods
to
a
glen
where
two
young
warriors
had
kindled
a
little
fire
of
sticks
as
a
signal
of
welcome
the
chiefs
gathered
around
the
fire
and
spoke
together
in
low
tones
this
was
deyuhnyon
kwarakda
which
means
reception
at
the
edge
of
the
henry
and
some
others
followed
as
it
was
not
forbidden
to
see
and
his
interest
increased
he
shared
the
spiritual
feeling
which
was
impressed
upon
the
red
faces
about
him
the
bright
moonlight
too
added
to
the
effect
giving
it
the
tinge
of
an
old
druidical
ceremony
the
chiefs
relapsed
into
silence
and
sat
thus
about
ten
minutes
then
rose
the
sound
of
a
chant
distant
and
measured
and
a
procession
of
young
and
inferior
chiefs
led
by
oneidas
appeared
slowly
approaching
the
fire
behind
them
were
warriors
and
behind
the
warriors
were
many
women
and
children
all
the
women
were
in
their
brightest
attire
gay
with
feather
headdresses
and
red
blue
or
green
blankets
from
the
british
posts
the
procession
stopped
at
a
distance
of
about
a
dozen
yards
from
the
chiefs
about
the
council
fire
and
the
oneida
kathlahon
formed
the
men
in
a
line
facing
the
head
chiefs
with
the
women
and
children
grouped
in
an
irregular
mass
behind
them
the
singing
meanwhile
had
stopped
the
two
groups
stood
facing
each
other
attentive
and
listening
then
hahiron
the
oldest
of
the
onondagas
walked
back
and
forth
in
the
space
between
the
two
groups
chanting
a
welcome
like
all
indian
songs
it
was
monotonous
every
line
he
uttered
with
emphasis
and
a
rising
inflection
the
phrase
which
may
be
translated
to
thee
or
better
hail
nevertheless
under
the
moonlight
in
the
wilderness
and
with
rapt
faces
about
him
it
was
deeply
impressive
henry
found
it
so
hahiron
finished
his
round
and
went
back
to
his
place
by
the
fire
atotarho
head
chief
of
the
onondagas
holding
in
his
hands
beautifully
beaded
strings
of
iroquois
wampum
came
forward
and
made
a
speech
of
condolence
to
which
kathlahon
responded
then
the
head
chiefs
and
the
minor
chiefs
smoked
pipes
together
after
which
the
head
chiefs
followed
by
the
minor
chiefs
and
these
in
turn
by
the
crowd
led
the
way
back
to
the
village
many
hundreds
of
persons
were
in
this
procession
which
was
still
very
grave
and
solemn
every
one
in
it
impressed
by
the
sacred
nature
of
this
ancient
rite
the
chief
entered
the
great
door
of
the
long
house
and
all
who
could
find
places
not
reserved
followed
henry
went
in
with
the
others
and
sat
in
a
corner
making
himself
as
small
as
possible
many
women
the
place
of
whom
was
high
among
the
iroquois
were
also
in
the
long
house
the
head
chiefs
sat
on
raised
seats
at
the
north
end
of
the
great
room
in
front
of
them
on
lower
seats
were
the
minor
chiefs
of
the
three
older
nations
on
the
left
and
of
the
three
younger
nations
on
the
right
in
front
of
these
but
sitting
on
the
bark
floor
was
a
group
of
warriors
at
the
east
end
on
both
high
and
low
seats
were
warriors
and
facing
them
on
the
western
side
were
women
also
on
both
high
and
low
seats
the
southern
side
facing
the
chiefs
was
divided
into
sections
each
with
high
and
low
seats
the
one
on
the
left
was
occupied
by
men
and
the
one
on
the
right
by
women
two
small
fires
burned
in
the
center
of
the
long
house
about
fifteen
feet
apart
it
was
the
most
singular
and
one
of
the
most
impressive
scenes
that
henry
had
ever
beheld
when
all
had
found
their
seats
there
was
a
deep
silence
henry
could
hear
the
slight
crackling
made
by
the
two
fires
as
they
burned
and
the
light
fell
faintly
across
the
multitude
of
dark
eager
faces
not
less
than
five
hundred
people
were
in
the
long
house
and
here
was
the
red
man
at
his
best
the
first
of
the
wild
not
the
second
or
third
of
the
civilized
a
drop
of
whose
blood
in
his
veins
brings
to
the
white
man
now
a
sense
of
pride
and
not
of
shame
as
it
does
when
that
blood
belongs
to
some
other
races
the
effect
upon
henry
was
singular
he
almost
forgot
that
he
was
a
foe
among
them
on
a
mission
for
the
moment
he
shared
in
their
feelings
and
he
waited
with
eagerness
for
whatever
might
come
thayendanegea
the
mohawk
stood
up
in
his
place
among
the
great
chiefs
the
role
he
was
about
to
assume
belonged
to
atotarho
the
onondaga
but
the
old
onondaga
assigned
it
for
the
occasion
to
thayendanegea
and
there
was
no
objection
thayendanegea
was
an
educated
man
he
had
been
in
england
he
was
a
member
of
a
christian
church
and
he
had
translated
a
part
of
the
bible
from
english
into
his
own
tongue
but
now
he
was
all
a
mohawk
a
son
of
the
forest
he
spoke
to
the
listening
crowd
of
the
glories
of
the
six
nations
how
the
spirit
of
good
had
inspired
hiawatha
to
form
the
great
confederacy
of
the
five
nations
afterwards
the
six
how
they
had
held
their
hunting
grounds
for
nearly
two
centuries
against
both
english
and
french
and
how
they
would
hold
them
against
the
americans
he
stopped
at
moments
and
deep
murmurs
of
approval
went
through
the
long
house
the
eyes
of
both
men
and
women
flashed
as
the
orator
spoke
of
their
glory
and
greatness
timmendiquas
in
a
place
of
honor
nodded
approval
if
he
could
he
would
form
such
another
league
in
the
west
the
air
in
the
long
house
breathed
by
so
many
became
heated
it
seemed
to
have
in
it
a
touch
of
fire
the
orator
words
burned
swift
and
deep
impressions
were
left
upon
the
excited
brain
the
tall
figure
of
the
mohawk
towered
gigantic
in
the
half
light
and
the
spell
that
he
threw
over
all
was
complete
he
spoke
about
half
an
hour
but
when
he
stopped
he
did
not
sit
down
henry
knew
by
the
deep
breath
that
ran
through
the
long
house
that
something
more
was
coming
from
thayendanegea
suddenly
the
red
chief
began
to
sing
in
a
deep
vibrant
voice
and
this
was
the
song
that
he
sung
this
was
the
roll
of
you
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
you
that
joined
in
the
work
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
you
that
finished
the
task
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
the
great
league
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
there
was
the
same
incessant
repetition
of
haih
that
henry
had
noticed
in
the
chant
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
but
it
seemed
to
give
a
cumulative
effect
like
the
roll
of
thunder
and
at
every
slight
pause
that
deep
breath
of
approval
ran
through
the
crowd
in
the
long
house
the
effect
of
the
song
was
indescribable
fire
ran
in
the
veins
of
all
men
women
and
children
the
great
pulses
in
their
throats
leaped
up
they
were
the
mighty
nation
the
the
league
of
the
that
had
held
at
bay
both
the
french
and
the
english
since
first
a
white
man
was
seen
in
the
land
and
that
would
keep
back
the
americans
now
henry
glanced
at
timmendiquas
the
nostrils
of
the
great
white
lightning
were
twitching
the
song
reached
to
the
very
roots
of
his
being
and
aroused
all
his
powers
like
thayendanegea
he
was
a
statesman
and
he
saw
that
the
americans
were
far
more
formidable
to
his
race
than
english
or
french
had
ever
been
the
americans
were
upon
the
ground
and
incessantly
pressed
upon
the
red
man
eye
to
eye
only
powerful
leagues
like
those
of
the
iroquois
could
withstand
them
thayendanegea
sat
down
and
then
there
was
another
silence
a
period
lasting
about
two
minutes
these
silences
seemed
to
be
a
necessary
part
of
all
iroquois
rites
when
it
closed
two
young
warriors
stretched
an
elm
bark
rope
across
the
room
from
east
to
west
and
near
the
ceiling
but
between
the
high
chiefs
and
the
minor
chiefs
then
they
hung
dressed
skins
all
along
it
until
the
two
grades
of
chiefs
were
hidden
from
the
view
of
each
other
this
was
the
sign
of
mourning
and
was
followed
by
a
silence
the
fires
in
the
long
house
had
died
down
somewhat
and
little
was
to
be
seen
but
the
eyes
and
general
outline
of
the
people
then
a
slender
man
of
middle
years
the
best
singer
in
all
the
iroquois
nation
arose
and
sang
to
the
great
chiefs
bring
we
greeting
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
to
the
dead
chiefs
kindred
greeting
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
to
the
strong
men
him
greeting
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
to
the
mourning
women
greeting
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
there
our
grandsires
words
repeating
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
graciously
oh
grandsires
hear
all
hail
all
hail
all
hail
the
singing
voice
was
sweet
penetrating
and
thrilling
and
the
song
was
sad
at
the
pauses
deep
murmurs
of
sorrow
ran
through
the
crowd
in
the
long
house
grief
for
the
dead
held
them
all
when
he
finished
satekariwate
the
mohawk
holding
in
his
hands
three
belts
of
wampum
uttered
a
long
historical
chant
telling
of
their
glorious
deeds
to
which
they
listened
patiently
the
chant
over
he
handed
the
belts
to
an
attendant
who
took
them
to
thayendanegea
who
held
them
for
a
few
moments
and
looked
at
them
gravely
one
of
the
wampum
belts
was
black
the
sign
of
mourning
another
was
purple
the
sign
of
war
and
the
third
was
white
the
sign
of
peace
they
were
beautiful
pieces
of
workmanship
very
old
when
hiawatha
left
the
onondagas
and
fled
to
the
mohawks
he
crossed
a
lake
supposed
to
be
the
oneida
while
paddling
along
he
noticed
that
man
tiny
black
purple
and
white
shells
clung
to
his
paddle
reaching
the
shore
he
found
such
shells
in
long
rows
upon
the
beach
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
use
them
for
the
depiction
of
thought
according
to
color
he
strung
them
on
threads
of
elm
bark
and
afterward
when
the
great
league
was
formed
the
shells
were
made
to
represent
five
clasped
hands
for
four
hundred
years
the
wampum
belts
have
been
sacred
among
the
iroquois
now
thayendanegea
gave
the
wampum
belts
back
to
the
attendant
who
returned
them
to
satekariwate
the
mohawk
there
was
a
silence
once
more
and
then
the
chosen
singer
began
the
consoling
song
again
but
now
he
did
not
sing
it
alone
two
hundred
male
voices
joined
him
and
the
time
became
faster
its
tone
changed
from
mourning
and
sorrow
to
exultation
and
menace
everyone
thought
of
war
the
tomahawk
and
victory
the
song
sung
as
it
was
now
became
a
genuine
battle
song
rousing
and
thrilling
the
long
house
trembled
with
the
mighty
chorus
and
its
volume
poured
forth
into
the
encircling
dark
woods
all
the
time
the
song
was
going
on
satekariwate
the
mohawk
stood
holding
the
belts
in
his
hand
but
when
it
was
over
he
gave
them
to
an
attendant
who
carried
them
to
another
head
chief
thayendanegea
now
went
to
the
center
of
the
room
and
standing
between
the
two
fires
asked
who
were
the
candidates
for
the
places
of
the
dead
chiefs
the
dead
chiefs
were
three
and
three
tall
men
already
chosen
among
their
own
tribes
came
forward
to
succeed
them
then
a
fourth
came
and
henry
was
startled
it
was
timmendiquas
who
as
the
bravest
chief
of
the
brave
wyandots
was
about
to
become
as
a
signal
tribute
and
as
a
great
sign
of
friendship
an
adopted
son
and
honorary
chief
of
the
mohawks
keepers
of
the
western
gate
and
most
warlike
of
all
the
iroquois
tribes
as
timmendiquas
stood
before
thayendanegea
a
murmur
of
approval
deeper
than
any
that
had
gone
before
ran
through
all
the
crowd
in
the
long
house
and
it
was
deepest
on
the
women
benches
where
sat
many
matrons
of
the
iroquois
some
of
whom
were
woman
could
be
a
chief
among
the
iroquois
the
candidates
were
adjudged
acceptable
by
the
other
chiefs
and
thayendanegea
addressed
them
on
their
duties
while
they
listened
in
grave
silence
with
his
address
the
sacred
part
of
the
rite
was
concluded
nothing
remained
now
but
the
great
banquet
outside
although
that
was
much
and
they
poured
forth
to
it
joyously
thayendanegea
the
mohawk
and
timmendiquas
the
wyandot
walking
side
by
side
the
finest
two
red
chiefs
on
all
the
american
continent
chapter
vi
the
evil
spirit
work
henry
slipped
forth
with
the
crowd
from
the
long
house
stooping
somewhat
and
shrinking
into
the
smallest
possible
dimensions
but
there
was
little
danger
now
that
any
one
would
notice
him
as
long
as
he
behaved
with
prudence
because
all
grief
and
solemnity
were
thrown
aside
and
a
thousand
red
souls
intended
to
rejoice
a
vast
banquet
was
arranged
great
fires
leaped
up
all
through
the
village
at
every
fire
the
indian
women
both
young
and
old
were
already
far
forward
with
the
cooking
deer
bear
squirrel
rabbit
fish
and
every
other
variety
of
game
with
which
the
woods
and
rivers
of
western
new
york
and
pennsylvania
swarmed
were
frying
or
roasting
over
the
coals
and
the
air
was
permeated
with
savory
odors
there
was
a
great
hum
of
voices
and
an
incessant
chattering
here
in
the
forest
among
themselves
and
in
complete
security
the
indian
stoicism
was
relaxed
according
to
their
customs
everybody
fell
to
eating
at
a
prodigious
rate
as
if
they
had
not
tasted
anything
for
a
month
and
as
if
they
intended
to
eat
enough
now
to
last
another
month
it
was
far
into
the
night
because
the
ceremonies
had
lasted
a
long
time
but
a
brilliant
moon
shone
down
upon
the
feasting
crowd
and
the
flames
of
the
great
fires
yellow
and
blue
leaped
and
danced
this
was
an
oasis
of
light
and
life
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
sat
together
before
the
largest
fire
and
they
ate
with
more
restraint
than
the
others
even
at
the
banquet
they
would
not
relax
their
dignity
as
great
chiefs
old
skanawati
the
onondaga
old
atotarho
onondaga
too
satekariwate
the
mohawk
kanokarih
the
seneca
and
others
head
chiefs
though
they
were
of
the
three
senior
tribes
did
not
hesitate
to
eat
as
the
rich
romans
of
the
empire
ate
swallowing
immense
quantities
of
all
kinds
of
meat
and
drinking
a
sort
of
cider
that
the
women
made
several
warriors
ate
and
drank
until
they
fell
down
in
a
stupor
by
the
fires
the
same
warriors
on
the
hunt
or
the
war
path
would
go
for
days
without
food
enduring
every
manner
of
hardship
now
and
then
a
warrior
would
leap
up
and
begin
a
chant
telling
of
some
glorious
deed
of
his
those
at
his
own
fire
would
listen
but
elsewhere
they
took
no
notice
in
the
largest
open
space
a
onondaga
with
a
fine
face
suddenly
uttered
a
sharp
cry
which
he
rapidly
repeated
twice
two
score
voices
instantly
replied
and
a
rush
was
made
for
him
at
least
a
hundred
gathered
around
him
but
they
stood
in
a
respectful
circle
no
one
nearer
than
ten
feet
he
waved
his
hand
and
all
sat
down
on
the
ground
then
he
too
sat
down
all
gazing
at
him
intently
and
with
expectancy
he
was
a
professional
an
institution
great
and
honored
among
the
tribes
of
the
iroquois
farther
back
even
than
hiawatha
he
began
at
once
the
story
of
the
warrior
who
learned
to
talk
with
the
deer
and
the
bear
carrying
it
on
through
many
chapters
now
and
then
a
delighted
listener
would
cry
but
if
anyone
became
bored
and
fell
asleep
it
was
considered
an
omen
of
misfortune
to
the
sleeper
and
he
was
chased
ignominiously
to
his
tepee
the
iroquois
romancer
was
better
protected
than
the
white
one
is
he
could
finish
some
of
his
stories
in
one
evening
but
others
were
serials
when
he
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
night
installment
he
would
cry
which
was
equivalent
to
our
be
continued
in
our
then
all
would
rise
and
if
tired
would
seek
sleep
but
if
not
they
would
catch
the
closing
part
of
some
other
romance
at
three
fires
senecas
were
playing
a
peculiar
little
wooden
flute
of
their
own
invention
that
emitted
wailing
sounds
not
without
a
certain
sweetness
in
a
corner
a
half
dozen
warriors
hurt
in
battle
were
bathing
their
wounds
with
a
soothing
lotion
made
from
the
sap
of
the
bass
wood
henry
lingered
a
while
in
the
darkest
corners
witnessing
the
feasting
hearing
the
flutes
and
the
chants
listening
for
a
space
to
the
and
the
enthusiastic
they
were
so
full
of
feasting
and
merrymaking
now
that
one
could
almost
do
as
he
pleased
and
he
stole
toward
the
southern
end
of
the
village
where
he
had
noticed
several
huts
much
more
strongly
built
than
the
others
despite
all
his
natural
skill
and
experience
his
heart
beat
very
fast
when
he
came
to
the
first
he
was
about
to
achieve
the
great
exploration
upon
which
he
had
ventured
so
much
whether
he
would
find
anything
at
the
end
of
the
risk
he
ran
he
was
soon
to
see
the
hut
about
seven
feet
square
and
as
many
feet
in
height
was
built
strongly
of
poles
with
a
small
entrance
closed
by
a
clapboard
door
fastened
stoutly
on
the
outside
with
withes
the
hut
was
well
in
the
shadow
of
tepees
and
all
were
still
at
the
feasting
and
merrymaking
he
cut
the
withes
with
two
sweeps
of
his
sharp
hunting
knife
opened
the
door
bent
his
head
stepped
in
and
then
closed
the
door
behind
him
in
order
that
no
iroquois
might
see
what
had
happened
it
was
not
wholly
dark
in
the
hut
as
there
were
cracks
between
the
poles
and
bars
of
moonlight
entered
falling
upon
a
floor
of
bark
they
revealed
also
a
figure
lying
full
length
on
one
side
of
the
hut
a
great
pulse
of
joy
leaped
up
in
henry
throat
and
with
it
was
a
deep
pity
also
the
figure
was
that
of
sol
but
he
was
pale
and
thin
and
his
arms
and
legs
were
securely
bound
with
thongs
of
deerskin
leaning
over
henry
cut
the
thongs
of
the
shiftless
one
but
he
did
not
stir
great
forester
that
sol
was
and
usually
so
sensitive
to
the
lightest
movement
he
perceived
nothing
now
and
had
he
not
found
him
bound
henry
would
have
been
afraid
that
he
was
looking
upon
his
dead
comrade
the
hands
of
the
shiftless
one
when
the
hands
were
cut
had
fallen
limply
by
his
side
and
his
face
looked
all
the
more
pallid
by
contrast
with
the
yellow
hair
which
fell
in
length
about
it
but
it
was
his
friend
the
dauntless
sol
the
last
of
the
five
to
vanish
so
mysteriously
henry
bent
down
and
pulled
him
by
the
shoulder
the
captive
yawned
stretched
himself
a
little
and
lay
still
again
with
closed
eyes
henry
shook
him
a
second
time
and
more
violently
sol
sat
up
quickly
and
henry
knew
that
indignation
prompted
the
movement
sol
held
his
arms
and
legs
stiffly
and
seemed
to
be
totally
unconscious
that
they
were
unbound
he
cast
one
glance
upward
and
in
the
dim
light
saw
the
tall
warrior
bending
over
him
never
do
it
timmendiquas
or
white
lightning
whichever
name
you
like
better
he
exclaimed
wo
show
you
how
to
surprise
the
white
settlements
you
can
burn
me
at
the
stake
or
tear
me
in
pieces
first
now
go
away
and
let
me
he
sank
back
on
the
bark
and
started
to
close
his
eyes
again
it
was
then
that
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
his
hands
were
unbound
he
held
them
up
before
his
face
as
if
they
were
strange
objects
wholly
unattached
to
himself
and
gazed
at
them
in
amazement
he
moved
his
legs
and
saw
that
they
too
were
unbound
then
he
turned
his
startled
gaze
upward
at
the
face
of
the
tall
warrior
who
was
looking
down
at
him
sol
was
wholly
awake
now
every
faculty
in
him
was
alive
and
he
pierced
through
the
shawnee
disguise
he
knew
who
it
was
he
knew
who
had
come
to
save
him
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
exclaiming
the
one
word
the
hands
of
the
comrades
met
in
the
clasp
of
friendship
which
only
many
dangers
endured
together
can
give
did
you
get
here
asked
the
shiftless
one
in
a
whisper
met
an
indian
in
the
forest
replied
henry
well
i
am
now
sol
laughed
under
his
breath
see
said
he
how
did
you
get
through
the
camp

a
big
one
and
the
iroquois

watchful
timmendiquas

with
his

replied
henry
i

about
almost
unnoticed
where

the
others
sol
the
cabins

we
get
out
of
this
place
quick
tie
up
your
hair
in
the
darkness
you
can
easily
pass
for
an
the
shiftless
one
drew
his
hair
into
a
scalp
lock
and
the
two
slipped
from
the
cabin
closing
the
door
behind
them
and
deftly
retying
the
thongs
in
order
that
the
discovery
of
the
escape
might
occur
as
late
as
possible
then
they
stood
a
few
moments
in
the
shadow
of
the
hut
and
listened
to
the
sounds
of
revelry
the
monotone
of
the
and
the
chant
of
the
singers
do
know
which
huts
they
are
in
do
you
asked
henry
anxiously
i
do
replied
the
shiftless
one
back
exclaimed
henry
softly
you
see
who
passing
out
there
wyatt
said
sol
like
to
get
my
hands
on
that
scoundrel
i
had
to
stand
a
lot
from
score
must
wait
but
first
we
provide
you
with
weapons
see
the
iroquois
have
stacked
some
of
their
rifles
here
while
they
at
the
a
dozen
good
rifles
had
been
left
leaning
against
a
hut
near
by
and
henry
still
watching
lest
he
be
observed
chose
the
best
with
its
ammunition
for
his
comrade
who
owing
to
his
attire
still
remained
in
the
shadow
of
the
other
hut
not
take
four
whispered
the
shiftless
one
need
them
for
the
other
henry
took
four
giving
two
to
his
comrade
and
then
they
hastily
slipped
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
hut
a
wyandot
and
a
mohawk
were
passing
and
they
had
eyes
of
hawks
henry
and
sol
waited
until
the
formidable
pair
were
gone
and
then
began
to
examine
the
huts
trying
to
surmise
in
which
their
comrades
lay
have
seen
said
sol
i
reckon
from
the
talk
that
they
are
here
i
was
in
the
woods
henry
a
half
dozen
reds
jumped
on
me
so
quick
i
did
have
time
to
draw
a
weepin
timmendiquas
was
at
the
head
uv
an
he
just
grinned
well
he
is
a
great
chief
if
he
did
truss
me
up
like
a
fowl
i
reckon
the
same
thing
happened
to
the
closer
sol
come
closer
whispered
henry
warriors
are
walking
this
way
the
feast
is
breaking
up
and
they
spread
all
through
the
a
terrible
problem
was
presented
to
the
two
they
could
no
longer
search
among
the
strong
huts
for
their
comrades
the
opportunity
to
save
had
lasted
long
enough
for
one
only
but
border
training
is
stern
and
these
two
had
uncommon
courage
and
decision
must
go
now
sol
said
henry
we
come
said
the
shiftless
one
come
darting
between
the
huts
they
gained
the
southern
edge
of
the
forest
before
the
satiated
banqueters
could
suspect
the
presence
of
an
enemy
here
they
felt
themselves
safe
but
they
did
not
pause
henry
led
the
way
and
sol
followed
at
a
fair
degree
of
speed
have
to
be
patient
with
me
for
a
little
while
henry
said
sol
in
a
tone
of
humility
i
wuz
layin
thar
in
the
lodge
with
my
hands
an
feet
tied
i
wuz
about
eighty
years
old
jest
ez
stiff
ez
could
be
from
the
long
tyin
when
i
reached
the
edge
o
the
woods
the
blood

flowin
lively
enough
to
make
me
sixty

an
ef
things
go
well
i
be
back
to
my
own
nateral
age
in
two
or
three
shall
have
rest
before
morning
said
henry
it
will
be
in
a
good
place
too
i
can
promise
sol
looked
at
him
inquiringly
but
he
did
not
say
anything
like
the
rest
of
the
five
sol
had
acquired
the
most
implicit
confidence
in
their
bold
young
leader
he
had
every
reason
to
feel
good
that
painful
soreness
was
disappearing
from
his
ankles
as
they
advanced
through
the
woods
weeks
dropped
from
him
one
by
one
then
the
months
began
to
roll
away
and
at
last
time
fell
year
by
year
as
they
approached
the
deeps
of
the
forest
where
the
swamp
lay
solomon
hyde
the
so
called
shiftless
one
and
wholly
undeserving
of
the
name
was
young
again
got
a
fine
little
home
for
us
sol
said
henry
we
had
since
that
time
we
spent
a
winter
on
the
island
in
the
lake
this
is
littler
but
it
harder
to
find
it
be
a
fine
thing
to
know
sleeping
safe
and
sound
with
five
hundred
iroquois
warriors
only
a
few
miles
it
suit
me
mighty
well
said
sol
grinning
broadly
jest
the
place
fur
a
lazy
man
like
your
humble
servant
which
is
they
reached
the
stepping
stones
and
henry
paused
a
moment
you
feel
steady
enough
sol
to
jump
from
stone
to
stone
he
asked
feelin
so
good
i
could
fly
ef
i
had
to
he
replied
you
jump
on
henry
an
fur
every
jump
you
take
you
find
me
only
one
jump
behind
you
henry
without
further
ado
sprang
from
one
stone
to
another
and
behind
him
stone
for
stone
came
the
shiftless
one
it
was
now
past
midnight
and
the
moon
was
obscured
the
keenest
eyes
twenty
yards
away
could
not
have
seen
the
two
dusky
figures
as
they
went
by
leaps
into
the
very
heart
of
the
great
black
swamp
they
reached
the
solid
ground
and
then
the
hut
sol
said
henry
my
house
and
yours
also
and
soon
i
hope
to
be
that
of
paul
tom
and
jim
said
sol
shorely
glad
to
they
went
inside
stacked
their
captured
rifles
against
the
wall
and
soon
were
sound
asleep
meanwhile
sleep
was
laying
hold
of
the
iroquois
village
also
they
had
eaten
mightily
and
they
had
drunk
mightily
many
times
had
they
told
the
glories
of
the
great
league
and
many
times
had
they
gladly
acknowledged
the
valor
and
worth
of
timmendiquas
and
the
brave
little
wyandot
nation
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
had
sat
side
by
side
throughout
the
feast
but
often
other
great
chiefs
were
with
atotarho
and
hahiron
the
onondagas
satekariwate
the
mohawk
kanokarih
and
kanyadoriyo
the
senecas
and
many
others
toward
midnight
the
women
and
the
children
left
for
the
lodges
and
soon
the
warriors
began
to
go
also
or
fell
asleep
on
the
ground
wrapped
in
their
blankets
the
fires
were
allowed
to
sink
low
and
at
last
the
older
chiefs
withdrew
leaving
only
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
have
seen
the
power
and
spirit
of
the
iroquois
said
thayendanegea
can
bring
many
more
warriors
than
are
here
into
the
field
and
we
will
strike
the
white
settlements
with
wyandots
are
not
so
many
as
the
warriors
of
the
great
league
said
timmendiquas
proudly
no
one
has
ever
been
before
them
in
speak
truth
as
i
have
often
heard
it
said
thayendanegea
thoughtfully
then
he
showed
timmendiquas
to
a
lodge
of
honor
the
finest
in
the
village
and
retired
to
his
own
the
great
feast
was
over
but
the
chiefs
had
come
to
a
momentous
decision
still
chafing
over
their
defeat
at
oriskany
they
would
make
a
new
and
formidable
attack
upon
the
white
settlements
and
timmendiquas
and
his
fierce
wyandots
would
help
them
all
of
them
from
the
oldest
to
the
youngest
rejoiced
in
the
decision
and
not
least
the
famous
thayendanegea
he
hated
the
americans
most
because
they
were
upon
the
soil
and
were
always
pressing
forward
against
the
indian
the
englishmen
were
far
away
and
if
they
prevailed
in
the
great
war
the
march
of
the
american
would
be
less
rapid
he
would
strike
once
more
with
the
englishmen
and
the
iroquois
could
deliver
mighty
blows
on
the
american
rearguard
he
and
his
mohawks
proud
keepers
of
the
western
gate
would
lead
in
the
onset
thayendanegea
considered
it
a
good
night
work
and
he
slept
peacefully
the
great
camp
relapsed
into
silence
the
warriors
on
the
ground
breathed
perhaps
a
little
heavily
after
so
much
feasting
and
the
fires
were
permitted
to
smolder
down
to
coals
wolves
and
panthers
drawn
by
the
scent
of
food
crept
through
the
thickets
toward
the
faint
firelight
but
they
were
afraid
to
draw
near
morning
came
and
food
and
drink
were
taken
to
the
lodges
in
which
four
prisoners
were
held
prisoners
of
great
value
taken
by
timmendiquas
and
the
wyandots
and
held
at
his
urgent
insistence
as
hostages
three
were
found
as
they
had
been
left
and
when
their
bonds
were
loosened
they
ate
and
drank
but
the
fourth
hut
was
empty
the
one
who
spoke
in
a
slow
drawling
way
and
the
one
who
seemed
to
be
the
most
dangerous
of
them
all
was
gone
henry
and
sol
had
taken
the
severed
thongs
with
them
and
there
was
nothing
to
show
how
the
prisoner
had
disappeared
except
that
the
withes
fastening
the
door
had
been
cut
the
news
spread
through
the
village
and
there
was
much
excitement
thayendanegea
and
timmendiquas
came
and
looked
at
the
empty
hut
timmendiquas
may
have
suspected
how
sol
had
gone
but
he
said
nothing
others
believed
that
it
was
the
work
of
the
spirit
of
evil
or
perhaps
the
spirit
of
the
winds
had
taken
him
away
is
well
to
keep
a
good
watch
on
the
others
said
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
nodded
that
day
the
chiefs
entered
the
long
house
again
and
held
a
great
war
council
a
string
of
white
wampum
about
a
foot
in
length
was
passed
to
every
chief
who
held
it
a
moment
or
two
before
handing
it
to
his
neighbors
it
was
then
laid
on
a
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
the
ends
touching
this
signified
harmony
among
the
six
nations
all
the
chiefs
had
been
summoned
to
this
place
by
belts
of
wampum
sent
to
the
different
tribes
by
runners
appointed
by
the
onondagas
to
whom
this
honor
belonged
all
treaties
had
to
be
ratified
by
the
exchange
of
belts
and
now
this
was
done
by
the
assembled
chiefs
timmendiquas
as
an
honorary
chief
of
the
mohawks
and
as
the
real
head
of
a
brave
and
allied
nation
was
present
throughout
the
council
his
advice
was
asked
often
and
when
he
gave
it
the
others
listened
with
gravity
and
deference
the
next
day
the
village
played
a
great
game
of
lacrosse
which
was
invented
by
the
indians
and
which
had
been
played
by
them
for
centuries
before
the
arrival
of
the
white
man
in
this
case
the
match
was
on
a
grand
scale
mohawks
and
cayugas
against
onondagas
and
senecas
the
game
began
about
nine
in
the
morning
in
a
great
natural
meadow
surrounded
by
forest
the
rival
sides
assembled
opposite
each
other
and
bet
heavily
all
the
stakes
under
the
law
of
the
game
were
laid
upon
the
ground
in
heaps
here
and
they
consisted
of
the
articles
most
precious
to
the
iroquois
in
these
heaps
were
rifles
tomahawks
scalping
knives
wampum
strips
of
colored
beads
blankets
swords
belts
moccasins
leggins
and
a
great
many
things
taken
as
spoil
in
forays
on
the
white
settlements
such
is
small
mirrors
brushes
of
various
kinds
boots
shoes
and
other
things
the
whole
making
a
vast
assortment
these
heaps
represented
great
wealth
to
the
iroquois
and
the
older
chiefs
sat
beside
them
in
the
capacity
of
stakeholders
and
judges
the
combatants
ranged
in
two
long
rows
numbered
at
least
five
hundred
on
each
side
and
already
they
began
to
show
an
excitement
approaching
that
which
animated
them
when
they
would
go
into
battle
their
eyes
glowed
and
the
muscles
on
their
naked
backs
and
chests
were
tense
for
the
spring
in
order
to
leave
their
limbs
perfectly
free
for
effort
they
wore
no
clothing
at
all
except
a
little
apron
reaching
from
the
waist
to
the
knee
the
extent
of
the
playground
was
marked
off
by
two
pair
of
like
those
used
in
cricket
planted
about
thirty
rods
apart
but
the
goals
of
each
side
were
only
about
thirty
feet
apart
at
a
signal
from
the
oldest
of
the
chiefs
the
contestants
arranged
themselves
in
two
parallel
lines
facing
each
other
inside
the
area
and
about
ten
rods
apart
every
man
was
armed
with
a
strong
stick
three
and
a
half
to
four
feet
in
length
and
curving
toward
the
end
upon
this
curved
end
was
tightly
fastened
a
network
of
thongs
of
untanned
deerskin
drawn
until
they
were
rigid
and
taut
the
ball
with
which
they
were
to
play
was
made
of
closely
wrapped
elastic
skins
and
was
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
apple
at
the
end
of
the
lines
but
about
midway
between
them
sat
the
chiefs
who
besides
being
judges
and
stakeholders
were
also
score
keepers
they
kept
tally
of
the
game
by
cutting
notches
upon
sticks
every
time
one
side
put
the
ball
through
the
other
goal
it
counted
one
but
there
was
an
unusual
power
exercised
by
the
chiefs
practically
unknown
to
the
games
of
white
men
if
one
side
got
too
far
ahead
its
score
was
cut
down
at
the
discretion
of
the
chiefs
in
order
to
keep
the
game
more
even
and
also
to
protract
it
sometimes
over
three
or
four
days
the
warriors
of
the
leading
side
might
grumble
among
one
another
at
the
amount
of
cutting
the
chiefs
did
but
they
would
not
dare
to
make
any
protest
however
the
chiefs
would
never
cut
the
leading
side
down
to
an
absolute
parity
with
the
other
it
was
always
allowed
to
retain
a
margin
of
the
superiority
it
had
won
the
game
was
now
about
to
begin
and
the
excitement
became
intense
even
the
old
judges
leaned
forward
in
their
eagerness
while
the
brown
bodies
of
the
warriors
shone
in
the
sun
and
the
taut
muscles
leaped
up
under
the
skin
fifty
players
on
each
side
sticks
in
hand
advanced
to
the
center
of
the
ground
and
arranged
themselves
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
football
players
to
intercept
the
passage
of
the
ball
toward
their
goals
now
they
awaited
the
coming
of
the
ball
there
were
several
young
girls
the
daughters
of
chiefs
the
most
beautiful
of
these
appeared
she
was
not
more
than
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
of
age
as
slender
and
graceful
as
a
young
deer
and
she
was
dressed
in
the
finest
and
most
richly
embroidered
deerskin
her
head
was
crowned
with
a
red
coronet
crested
with
plumes
made
of
the
feathers
of
the
eagle
and
heron
she
wore
silver
bracelets
and
a
silver
necklace
the
girl
bearing
in
her
hand
the
ball
sprang
into
the
very
center
of
the
arena
where
amid
shouts
from
all
the
warriors
she
placed
it
upon
the
ground
then
she
sprang
back
and
joined
the
throng
of
spectators
two
of
the
players
one
from
each
side
chosen
for
strength
and
dexterity
advanced
they
hooked
the
ball
together
in
their
united
bats
and
thus
raised
it
aloft
until
the
bats
were
absolutely
perpendicular
then
with
a
quick
jerking
motion
they
shot
it
upward
much
might
be
gained
by
this
first
shot
or
stroke
but
on
this
occasion
the
two
players
were
equal
and
it
shot
almost
absolutely
straight
into
the
air
the
nearest
groups
made
a
rush
for
it
and
the
fray
began
not
all
played
at
once
as
the
crowd
was
so
great
but
usually
twenty
or
thirty
on
each
side
struck
for
the
ball
and
when
they
became
exhausted
or
disabled
were
relieved
by
similar
groups
all
eventually
came
into
action
the
game
was
played
with
the
greatest
fire
and
intensity
assuming
sometimes
the
aspect
of
a
battle
blows
with
the
formidable
sticks
were
given
and
received
brown
skins
were
streaked
with
blood
heads
were
cracked
and
a
cayuga
was
killed
such
killings
were
not
unusual
in
these
games
and
it
was
always
considered
the
fault
of
the
man
who
fell
due
to
his
own
awkwardness
or
unwariness
the
body
of
the
dead
cayuga
was
taken
away
in
disgrace
all
day
long
the
contest
was
waged
with
undiminished
courage
and
zeal
party
relieving
party
the
meadow
and
the
surrounding
forest
resounded
with
the
shouts
and
yells
of
combatants
and
spectators
the
old
squaws
were
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
excitement
and
their
shrill
screams
of
applause
or
condemnation
rose
above
every
other
sound
on
this
occasion
as
the
contest
did
not
last
longer
than
one
day
the
chiefs
never
cut
down
the
score
of
the
leading
side
the
game
closed
at
sunset
with
the
senecas
and
onondagas
triumphant
and
richer
by
far
than
they
were
in
the
morning
the
mohawks
and
cayugas
retired
stripped
of
their
goods
and
crestfallen
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
acting
as
umpires
watched
the
game
closely
to
its
finish
but
not
so
the
renegades
braxton
wyatt
and
blackstaffe
they
and
quarles
had
wandered
eastward
with
some
delawares
and
had
afterward
joined
the
band
of
wyandots
though
timmendiquas
gave
them
no

warm
welcome
quarles
had
left
on
some
errand
a
few
days
before
they
had
rejoiced
greatly
at
the
trapping
of
the
four
one
by
one
in
the
deep
bush
but
they
had
felt
anger
and
disappointment
when
the
fifth
was
not
taken
also
now
both
were
concerned
and
alarmed
over
the
escape
of
sol
in
the
night
and
they
drew
apart
from
the
indians
to
discuss
it
think
said
wyatt
hyde
did
not
manage
it
himself
all
alone
how
could
he
he
was
bound
both
hand
and
foot
and
i
learned
too
blackstaffe
that
four
of
the
best
iroquois
rifles
have
been
taken
that
means
one
apiece
for
hyde
and
the
three
prisoners
that
are
the
two
exchanged
looks
of
meaning
and
understanding
must
have
been
the
boy
ware
who
helped
hyde
to
get
away
said
blackstaffe
their
taking
of
the
rifles
means
that
he
and
hyde
expect
to
rescue
the
other
three
in
the
same
way
you
think
so
too
course
replied
wyatt
makes
the
indians
who
are
so
wonderfully
alert
and
watchful
most
of
the
time
become
so
careless
when
they
have
a
great
feast
blackstaffe
shrugged
his
shoulders
is
their
way
he
replied
can
not
change
it
ware
must
have
noticed
what
they
were
about
and
he
took
advantage
of
it
but
i
think
any
of
the
others
will
go
that
boy
cotter
is
in
here
said
braxton
wyatt
tapping
the
side
of
a
small
hut
go
in
and
see
enough
said
blackstaffe
we
must
let
him
know
that
hyde
has
paul
also
bound
hand
and
foot
was
lying
on
an
old
wolfskin
he
too
was
pale
and
strict
confinement
had
told
upon
him
paul
spirit
could
never
be
daunted
he
looked
at
the
two
renegades
with
hatred
and
contempt
you
in
a
fine
fix
said
wyatt
sneeringly
just
came
in
to
tell
you
that
we
took
henry
ware
last
paul
looked
him
straight
and
long
in
the
eye
and
he
knew
that
the
renegade
was
lying
know
better
he
said
we
will
get
him
said
wyatt
abandoning
the
lie
all
of
you
will
die
at
the
will
not
get
him
said
paul
defiantly
as
for
the
rest
of
us
dying
at
the
stake
that
to
be
seen
i
know
this
timmendiquas
considers
us
of
value
to
be
traded
or
exchanged
and
he
too
smart
a
man
to
destroy
what
he
regards
as
his
own
property
besides
we
may
escape
i
do
want
to
boast
braxton
wyatt
but
you
know
that
hard
to
then
paul
managed
to
turn
over
with
his
face
to
the
wall
as
if
he
were
through
with
them
they
went
out
and
braxton
wyatt
said
sulkily
to
be
got
out
of
said
blackstaffe
we
must
urge
that
the
strictest
kind
of
guard
be
kept
over
the
the
iroquois
were
to
remain
some
time
at
the
village
because
all
their
forces
were
not
yet
gathered
for
the
great
foray
they
had
in
mind
the
onondaga
runners
were
still
carrying
the
wampum
belts
of
purple
shells
sign
of
war
to
distant
villages
of
the
tribes
and
parties
of
warriors
were
still
coming
in
a
band
of
cayugas
arrived
that
night
and
with
them
they
brought
a
half
starved
and
sick
whom
they
had
picked
up
near
the
camp
the
who
looked
as
if
he
might
have
been
when
in
health
a
strong
and
agile
warrior
said
that
news
had
reached
him
through
the
wyandots
of
the
great
war
to
be
waged
by
the
iroquois
on
the
white
settlements
and
the
spirits
would
not
let
him
rest
unless
he
bore
his
part
in
it
he
prayed
therefore
to
be
accepted
among
them
much
food
was
given
to
the
brave
and
he
was
sent
to
a
lodge
to
rest
he
would
be
well
and
he
would
be
welcomed
to
the
ranks
of
the
cayugas
a
younger
nation
but
when
the
morning
came
the
lodge
was
empty
the
sick
was
gone
and
with
him
the
boy
paul
the
youngest
of
the
prisoners
guards
bad
been
posted
all
around
the
camp
but
evidently
the
two
had
slipped
between
brave
and
advanced
as
were
the
iroquois
superstition
seized
upon
them
was
at
work
among
them
coming
in
the
form
of
the
famished
he
had
steeped
them
in
a
deep
sleep
and
then
he
had
vanished
with
the
prisoner
in
the
night
perhaps
lie
had
taken
away
the
boy
who
was
one
of
a
hated
race
for
some
sacrifice
or
mystery
of
his
own
the
fears
of
the
iroquois
rose
if
the
spirit
of
evil
was
among
them
greater
harm
could
be
expected
but
the
two
renegades
blackstaffe
and
wyatt
raged
they
did
not
believe
in
the
interference
of
either
good
spirits
or
bad
spirits
and
just
now
their
special
hatred
was
a
famished
warrior
on
earth
did
i
think
of
it
exclaimed
wyatt
sure
now
by
his
size
that
it
was
the
fellow
hyde
of
course
he
slipped
to
the
lodge
let
cotter
out
and
they
dodged
about
in
the
darkness
until
they
escaped
in
the
forest
i
complain
to
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
speaking
of
the
laxness
of
both
iroquois
and
wyandots
the
great
white
lightning
regarded
him
with
an
icy
stare
say
that
the
boy
cotter
escaped
through
carelessness
he
asked
do
exclaimed
wyatt
why
did
you
not
prevent
it
wyatt
trembled
a
little
before
the
stern
gaze
of
the
chief
when
continued
timmendiquas
you
a
deserter
front
your
own
people
had
the
right
to
hold
to
account
the
head
chief
of
the
wyandots
braxton
wyatt
brave
though
he
undoubtedly
was
trembled
yet
more
he
knew
that
timmendiquas
did
not
like
him
and
that
the
wyandot
chieftain
could
make
his
position
among
the
indians
precarious
did
not
mean
to
say
that
it
was
the
fault
of
anybody
in
particular
he
exclaimed
hastily
i
been
hearing
so
much
talk
about
the
spirit
of
evil
having
a
hand
in
this
that
i
could
keep
front
saying
something
of
course
it
was
henry
ware
and
hyde
who
did
it
may
be
said
timmendiquas
icily
neither
the
manitou
of
the
wyandots
nor
the
aieroski
of
the
iroquois
has
given
to
me
the
eyes
to
see
everything
that
happens
in
the
wyatt
withdrew
still
in
a
rage
but
afraid
to
say
more
he
and
blackstaffe
held
many
conferences
through
the
day
and
they
longed
for
the
presence
of
simon
girty
who
was
farther
west
that
night
an
onondaga
runner
arrived
from
one
of
the
farthest
villages
of
the
mohawks
far
east
toward
albany
he
had
been
sent
from
a
farther
village
and
was
not
known
personally
to
the
warriors
in
the
great
camp
but
he
bore
a
wampum
belt
of
purple
shells
the
sign
of
war
and
he
reported
directly
to
thayendanegea
to
whom
he
brought
stirring
and
satisfactory
words
after
ample
feasting
as
became
one
who
had
come
so
far
he
lay
upon
soft
deerskins
in
one
of
the
bark
huts
and
sought
sleep
but
braxton
wyatt
the
renegade
could
not
sleep
his
evil
spirit
warned
him
to
rise
and
go
to
the
huts
where
the
two
remaining
prisoners
were
kept
it
was
then
about
one
in
the
morning
and
as
he
passed
he
saw
the
onondaga
runner
at
the
door
of
one
of
the
prison
lodges
he
was
about
to
cry
out
but
the
onondaga
turned
and
struck
him
such
a
violent
blow
with
the
butt
of
a
pistol
snatched
from
under
his
deerskin
tunic
that
he
fell
senseless
when
a
mohawk
sentinel
found
and
revived
him
an
hour
later
the
door
of
the
hut
was
open
and
the
oldest
of
the
prisoners
the
one
called
ross
was
gone
now
indeed
were
the
iroquois
certain
that
the
spirit
of
evil
was
among
them
when
great
chiefs
like
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
were
deceived
how
could
a
common
warrior
hope
to
escape
its
wicked
influence
but
braxton
wyatt
with
a
sore
and
aching
head
lay
all
day
on
a
bed
of
skins
and
his
friend
moses
blackstaffe
could
give
him
no
comfort
the
following
night
the
camp
was
swept
by
a
sudden
and
tremendous
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
wind
and
rain
many
of
the
lodges
were
thrown
down
and
when
the
storm
finally
whirled
itself
away
it
was
found
that
the
last
of
the
prisoners
he
of
the
long
arms
and
long
legs
had
gone
on
the
edge
of
the
blast
truly
the
evil
spirit
had
been
hovering
over
the
iroquois
village
chapter

the

deep
in

once
more
and
full
of
content
the
great
storm
in
which
long
jim
with
the
aid
of
his
comrades
had
disappeared
was
whirling
off
to
the
eastward
the
lightning
was
flaring
its
last
on
the
distant
horizon
but
the
rain
still
pattered
in
the
great
woods
it
was
a
small
hut
but
the
five
could
squeeze
in
it
they
were
dry
warm
and
well
armed
and
they
had
no
fear
of
the
storm
and
the
wilderness
the
four
after
their
imprisonment
and
privations
were
recovering
their

and

paul

had

on

made
the
quickest

and
their
present
situation
so
fortunate
in
contrast
with
their
threatened
fate
a
few
days
before
made
a
great
appeal
to
his
imagination
the
door
was
allowed
to
stand
open
six
inches
and
through
the
crevice
he
watched
the
rain
pattering
on
the
dark
earth
he
felt
an
immense
sense
of
security
and
comfort
paul
was
hopeful
by
nature
and
full
of
courage
but
when
he
lay
bound
and
alone
in
a
hut
in
the
iroquois
camp
it
seemed
to
him
that
no
chance
was
left
the
comrades
had
been
kept
separate
and
he
had
supposed
the
others
to
be
dead
but
here
he
was
snatched
from
the
very
pit
of
death
and
all
the

had
been
saved

hev
my
watch
tom
every
night
fur
the
next
five
he
ranged
himself
against
the
wall
and
in
three
minutes
was
sound
asleep
henry
and
paul
found
room
in
the
line
and
they
too
soon
slept
tom
sat
at
the
door
one
of
the
captured
rifles
across
his
knees
and
watched
the
forest
and
the
swamp
he
saw
the
last
flare
of
the
distant
lightning
and
he
listened
to
the
falling
of
the
rain
drops
until
they
vanished
with
the
vanishing
wind
leaving
the
forest
still
and
without
noise
tom
was
several
years
older
than
any
of
the
others
and
although
powerful
in
action
he
was
singularly
chary
of
speech
henry
was
the
leader
but
somehow
tom
looked
upon
himself
as
a
watcher
over
the
other
four
a
sort
of
elder
brother
as
the
moon
came
out
a
little
in
the
wake
of
the
retreating
clouds
he
regarded
them
affectionately
two
three
four
five
he
murmured
to
himself
all
here
an
henry
come
fur
us
that
is
shorely
the
greatest
boy
the
world
hez
ever
seed
them
fellers
alexander
an
hannibal

paul
talks
about

an
shawnees
an
iroquois
ez
done
whar
they
hev
been
tom
ross
uttered
a
contemptuous
little
sniff
and
on
the
edge
of
that
sniff
alexander
and
hannibal
were
wafted
into
oblivion
then
he
went
outside
and
walked
about
the
islet
appreciating
for
the
tenth
time
what
a
wonderful
little
refuge
it
was
he
was
about
to
return
to
the
hut
when
he
saw
a
dozen
dark
blots
along
the
high
bough
of
a
tree
he
knew
them
they
were
welcome
blots
they
were
wild
turkeys
that
had
found
what
had
seemed
to
be
a
secure
roosting
place
in
the
swamp
tom
knew
that
the
meat
of
the
little
bear
was
nearly
exhausted
and
here
was
more
food
come
to
their
hand
five
feeders
an
need
you
he
murmured
looking
up
at
the
turkeys
you
kin
rest
thar
till
nearly
he
knew
that
the
turkeys
would
not
stir
and
he
went
back
to
the
hut
to
resume
his
watch
just
before
the
first
dawn
he
awoke
henry
he
said
lot
uv
foolish
wild
turkeys
hev
gone
to
rest
on
the
limb
of
a
tree
not
twenty
yards
from
this
grand
manshun
uv
ourn
to
me
that
wild
turkeys
wuz
made
fur
hungry
fellers
like
us
to
eat
kin
we
risk
a
shot
or
two
at
or
is
it
too
dangerous
think
we
can
risk
the
shots
said
henry
rising
and
taking
his
rifle
bound
to
risk
something
and
it
not
likely
that
indians
are
anywhere
they
slipped
from
the
cabin
leaving
the
other
three
still
sound
asleep
and
stepped
noiselessly
among
the
trees
the
first
pale
gray
bar
that
heralded
the
dawn
was
just
showing
in
the
cast
they
are
said
tom
ross
pointing
at
the
dozen
dark
blots
on
the
high
bough
take
good
aim
and
when
i
say
we
both
pull
trigger
said
henry
he
picked
out
a
huge
bird
near
the
end
of
the
line
but
he
noticed
when
he
drew
the
bead
that
a
second
turkey
just
behind
the
first
was
directly
in
his
line
of
fire
the
fact
aroused
his
ambition
to
kill
both
with
one
bullet
it
was
not
a
mere
desire
to
slaughter
or
to
display
marksmanship
but
they
needed
the
extra
turkey
for
food
you
ready
tom
he
asked
they
pulled
triggers
there
were
two
sharp
reports
terribly
loud
to
both
under
the
circumstances
and
three
of
the
biggest
and
fattest
of
the
turkeys
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
while
the
rest
flapped
their
wings
and
with
frightened
gobbles
flew
away
henry
was
about
to
rush
forward
but
silent
tom
held
him
back
show
yourself
henry
do
show
yourself
he
cried
in
tense
tones
what
the
matter
asked
the
boy
in
surprise
you
see
that
three
turkeys
fell
and
we
are
only
two
to
shoot

injun

layin
here
some
whar
an
he
drawed
a
bead
on
one
uv
them
turkeys
at
the
same
time
we
henry
laughed
and
put
away
tom
detaining
hand
no
indian
about

said

two
turkeys
with
one
shot
and
i
mighty
proud
of
it
too
i
saw
that
they
were
directly
in
the
line
of
the
bullet
and
it
went
through
silent
tom
heaved
a
mighty
sigh
of
relief
drawn
up
from
great
depths
glad
uv
that
henry
he
said
when
i
saw
that
third
turkey
come
tumblin
down
i
wuz

in

woods
they
picked
up
the
three
turkeys
two
gobblers
and
a
hen
and
found
them
large
and
fat
as
butter
more
than
once
the
wild
turkey
had
come
to
their
relief
and
in
fact
this
bird
played
a
great
part
in
the
life
of
the
frontier
wherever
that
frontier
might
be
as
it
shifted
steadily
westward
as
they
walked
back
toward
the
hut
they
faced

with
leveled

and

glued
on
the
turkeys
a
lazy

while
they
were
cooking
the
turkeys
henry
a
little
anxious
lest
the
sound
of
the
shots
had
been
heard
crossed
on
the
stepping
stones
and
scouted
a
bit
in
the
woods
but
there
was
no
sign
of
indian
presence
and
relieved
he
returned
to
the
islet
just
as
breakfast
was
ready
long
jim
had
exerted
all
his
surpassing
skill
and
it
was
a
contented
five
that
worked
on
one
of
the
turkeys
the
other
two
being
saved
for
further
needs
goin
to
be
the
next
thing
in
the
line
of
our
duty
henry
asked
long
jim
as
they
ate
have
plenty
to
do
from
all
that
sol
tells
us
replied
the
boy
seems
that
they
felt
so
sure
of
you
while
you
were
prisoners
that
they
often
talked
about
their
plans
where
you
could
hear
them
sol
has
told
me
of
two
or
three
talks
between
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
and
from
the
last
one
he
gathered
that
they
intending
a
raid
with
a
big
army
against
a
place
called
wyoming
in
the
valley
of
a
river
named
the
susquehanna
it
a
big
settlement
scattered
all
along
the
river
and
they
expect
to
take
a
lot
of
scalps
they
going
to
be
helped
by
british
from
canada
and
tories
boys
we
a
long
way
from
home
but
shall
we
go
and
tell
them
in
wyoming
what
coming
course
said
the
four
together
bein
a
long
way
from
home
do
make
any
difference
said
sol
generally
a
long
way
from
home
an
you
know
we
sent
word
back
from
pittsburgh
to
wareville
that
we
wuz
stayin
a
while
here
in
the
east
on
mighty
important
we
go
to
the
wyoming
valley
as
straight
and
as
fast
as
we
can
said
henry
settled
what
else
did
you
bear
about
their
plans
sol
to
break
up
the
village
here
soon
and
then
they
march
to
a
place
called
tioga
the
white
men
an
i
hear
that
to
be
a
lot
uv
join
thar
or
sooner
they
sent
chiefs
all
the
way
to
our
congress
at
philydelphy
pretendin
peace
an
then
when
they
git
our
people
to
thinkin
peace
they
jump
on
our
settlements
the
whole
ragin
army
uv
with
tomahawk
an
knife
a
white
man
named
john
butler
is
to
command
paul
shuddered
heard
of
him
he
said
called
him
butler
at
pittsburgh
he
helped
lead
the
indians
in
that
terrible
battle
of
the
oriskany
last
year
and
they
say
he
got
a
son
walter
butler
who
is
as
bad
as
he
is
and
there
are
other
white
leaders
of
the
indians
the
johnsons
and
ez
ef
we
would
be
needed
said
tom
ross
do
think
we
ought
to
hurry
said
henry
more
we
know
about
the
indian
plans
the
better
it
will
be
for
the
wyoming
people
we
a
safe
and
comfortable
hiding
place
here
and
we
can
stay
and
watch
the
indian
me
drawled
sol
legs
an
arms
are
still
stiff
from
them
deerskin
thongs
an
ez
long
jim
is
here
now
to
wait
on
me
i
guess
i
take
a
rest
from
do
all
your
own
waitin
on
yourself
rejoined
long
jim
afraid
you
wo
be
waited
on
so
well
either
but
a
good
deal
better
than
you
they
lay
on
the
islet
several
days
meanwhile
keeping
a
close
watch
on
the
indian
camp
they
really
had
little
to
fear
except
from
hunting
parties
as
the
region
was
far
from
any
settled
portion
of
the
country
and
the
indians
were
not
likely
to
suspect
their
continued
presence
but
the
hunters
were
numerous
and
all
the
squaws
in
the
camp
were
busy
jerking
meat
it
was
obvious
that
the
indians
were
preparing
for
a
great
campaign
but
that
they
would
take
their
own
time
most
of
the
scouting
was
done
by
henry
and
sol
and
several
times
they
lay
in
the
thick
brushwood
and
watched
by
the
light
of
the
fires
what
was
passing
in
the
indian
camp
on
the
fifth
night
after
the
rescue
of
long
jim
henry
and
sol
lay
in
the
covert
it
was
nearly
midnight
but
the
fires
still
burned
in
the
indian
camp
warriors
were
polishing
their
weapons
and
the
women
were
cutting
up
or
jerking
meat
while
they
were
watching
they
heard
from
a
point
to
the
north
the
sound
of
a
voice
rising
and
failing
in
a
kind
of
chant
war
party
comin
whispered
sol
singin
about
the
victories
that
they
goin
to
did
you
notice
that
voice
henry
whispered
back
not
a
man
it
a
that
you
speak
of
it
you
right
said
sol
funny
to
hear
an
injun
woman
chantin
about
battles
as
she
comes
into
camp
that
the
business
o
this
is
no
ordinary
woman
said
henry
pass
along
that
trail
there
within
twenty
yards
of
us
sol
and
we
want
to
see
we
do
said
sol
i
ai
breathin
while
they
they
flattened
themselves
against
the
earth
until
the
keenest
eye
could
not
see
them
in
the
darkness
all
the
time
the
singing
was
growing
louder
and
both
remained
quite
sure
that
it
was
the
voice
of
a
woman
the
trail
was
but
a
short
distance
away
and
the
moon
was
bright
the
fierce
indian
chant
swelled
and
presently
the
most
singular
figure
that
either
had
ever
seen
came
into
view
the
figure
was
that
of
an
indian
woman
but
lighter
in
color
than
most
of
her
kind
she
was
tall
heavily
built
and
arrayed
in
a
strange
mixture
of
civilized
and
barbaric
finery
deerskin
leggins
and
moccasins
gorgeously
ornamented
with
heads
a
red
dress
of
european
cloth
with
a
red
shawl
over
it
and
her
head
bare
except
for
bright
feathers
thrust
in
her
long
black
hair
which
hung
loosely
down
her
back
she
held
in
one
hand
a
large
sharp
tomahawk
which
she
swung
fiercely
in
time
to
her
song
her
face
had
the
rapt
terrible
expression
of
one
who
had
taken
some
fiery
and
powerful
drug
and
she
looked
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
as
she
strode
on
chanting
a
song
of
blood
and
swinging
the
keen
blade
henry
and
sol
shuddered
they
had
looked
upon
terrible
human
figures
but
nothing
so
frightful
as
this
a
woman
with
the
strength
of
a
man
and
twice
his
rage
and
cruelty
there
was
something
weird
and
awful
in
the
look
of
that
set
savage
face
and
the
tone
of
that
indian
chant
brave
as
they
were
henry
and
the
shiftless
one
felt
fear
as
perhaps
they
had
never
felt
it
before
in
their
lives
well
they
might
they
were
destined
to
behold
this
woman
again
under
conditions
the
most
awful
of
which
the
human
mind
can
conceive
and
to
witness
savagery
almost
unbelievable
in
either
man
or
woman
the
two
did
not
yet
know
it
but
they
were
looking
upon
catharine
montour
daughter
of
a
french
governor
general
of
canada
and
an
indian
woman
a
chieftainess
of
the
iroquois
and
of
a
memory
infamous
forever
on
the
border
where
she
was
known
as
sol
shuddered
again
and
whispered
to
henry
did
think
such
women
ever
lived
even
among
the
a
dozen
warriors
followed
queen
esther
stepping
in
single
file
and
their
manner
showed
that
they
acknowledged
her
their
leader
in
every
sense
she
was
truly
an
extraordinary
woman
not
even
the
great
thayendanegea
himself
wielded
a
stronger
influence
among
the
iroquois
in
her
youth
she
had
been
treated
as
a
white
woman
educated
and
dressed
as
a
white
woman
and
she
had
played
a
part
in
colonial
society
at
albany
new
york
and
philadelphia
but
of
her
own
accord
she
had
turned
toward
the
savage
half
of
herself
had
become
wholly
a
savage
had
married
a
savage
chief
bad
been
the
mother
of
savage
children
and
here
she
was
at
midnight
striding
into
an
iroquois
camp
in
the
wilderness
her
head
aflame
with
visions
of
blood
death
and
scalps
the
procession
passed
with
the
terrifying
female
figure
still
leading
still
singing
her
chant
and
the
curiosity
of
henry
and
sol
was
so
intense
that
taking
all
risks
they
slipped
along
in
the
rear
to
see
her
entry
queen
esther
strode
into
the
lighted
area
of
the
camp
ceased
her
chant
and
looked
around
as
if
a
queen
had
truly
come
and
was
waiting
to
be
welcomed
by
her
subjects
thayendanegea
who
evidently
expected
her
stepped
forward
and
gave
her
the
indian
salute
it
may
be
that
he
received
her
with
mild
enthusiasm
timmendiquas
a
wyandot
and
a
guest
though
an
ally
would
not
dispute
with
him
his
place
as
real
head
of
the
six
nations
but
this
terrible
woman
was
his
match
and
could
inflame
the
iroquois
to
almost
anything
that
she
wished
after
the
arrival
of
queen
esther
the
lights
in
the
iroquois
village
died
down
it
was
evident
to
both
henry
and
the
shiftless
one
that
they
had
been
kept
burning
solely
in
the
expectation
of
the
coming
of
this
formidable
woman
and
her
escort
it
was
obvious
that
nothing
more
was
to
be
seen
that
night
and
they
withdrew
swiftly
through
the
forest
toward
their
islet
they
stopped
once
in
an
oak
opening
and
sol
shivered
slightly
he
said
feel
all
through
me
that
somethin
terrible
is
comin
that
woman
back
thar
has
clean
give
me
the
shivers
i
more
afraid
of
her
than
i
am
of
timmendiquas
or
thayendanegea
do
you
think
she
is
a
witch
are
no
such
things
as
witches
but
she
was
uncanny
i
afraid
sol
that
your
feeling
about
something
terrible
going
to
happen
is
it
was
about
two
in
the
morning
when
they
reached
the
islet
tom
ross
was
awake
but
the
other
two
slumbered
peacefully
on
they
told
tom
what
they
had
seen
and
he
told
them
the
identity
of
the
terrible
woman
heard
about
her
at
pittsburgh
an
i
heard
tell
too
about
her
afore
i
went
to
kentucky
to
live
she
got
a
power
over
the
iroquois
they
think
she
ken
throw
spells
an
all
that
sort
of
mebbe
she
two
nights
later
it
was
henry
and
tom
who
lay
in
the
thickets
and
then
they
saw
other
formidable
arrivals
in
the
indian
camp
now
they
were
white
men
an
entire
company
in
green
uniforms
sir
john
johnson
royal
greens
as
henry
afterward
learned
and
with
them
was
the
infamous
john
butler
or
butler
as
he
was
generally
known
on
the
new
york
and
pennsylvania
frontier
short
and
fat
and
insignificant
of
appearance
but
energetic
savage
and
cruel
in
nature
he
was
a
descendant
of
the
duke
of
ormond
and
had
commanded
the
indians
at
the
terrible
battle
of
the
oriskany
preceding
burgoyne
capture
the
year
before
henry
and
tom
were
distant
spectators
at
an
extraordinary
council
around
one
of
the
fires
in
this
group
were
timmendiquas
thayendanegea
queen
esther
high
chiefs
of
the
distant
nations
and
the
white
men
john
butler
moses
blackstaffe
and
the
boy
braxton
wyatt
it
seemed
to
henry
that
timmendiquas
king
of
the
wyandots
was
superior
to
all
the
other
chiefs
present
even
to
thayendanegea
his
expression
was
nobler
than
that
of
the
great
mohawk
and
it
had
less
of
the
indian
cruelty
henry
and
tom
could
not
hear
that
was
said
but
they
felt
sure
the
iroquois
were
about
to
break
up
their
village
and
march
on
the
great
campaign
they
had
planned
the
two
and
their
comrades
could
render
no
greater
service
than
to
watch
their
march
and
then
warn
those
upon
whom
the
blow
was
to
fall
the
five
left
their
hut
on
the
islet
early
the
next
morning
well
equipped
with
provisions
and
that
day
they
saw
the
iroquois
dismantle
their
village
all
except
the
long
house
and
two
or
three
other
of
the
more
solid
structures
and
begin
the
march
henry
and
his
comrades
went
parallel
with
them
watching
their
movements
as
closely
as
possible
chapter
viii
a
change
of
tenants
the
five
were
engaged
upon
one
of
their
most
dangerous
tasks
to
keep
with
the
indian
army
and
yet
to
keep
out
of
its
hands
to
observe
what
was
going
on
and
to
divine
what
was
intended
from
what
they
observed
fortunately
it
was
early
summer
and
the
weather
being
very
beautiful
they
could
sleep
without
shelter
hence
they
found
it
convenient
to
sleep
sometimes
by
daylight
posting
a
watch
always
and
to
spy
upon
the
indian
camp
at
night
they
saw
other
reinforcements
come
for
the
indian
army
particularly
a
strong
division
of
senecas
under
two
great
war
chiefs
of
theirs
sangerachte
and
hiokatoo
and
also
a
body
of
tories
then
they
saw
them
go
into
their
last
great
camp
at
tioga
preparatory
to
their
swift
descent
upon
the
wyoming
valley
about
four
hundred
white
men
english
canadians
and
tories
were
present
and
eight
hundred
picked
warriors
of
the
six
nations
under
thayendanegea
besides
the
little
band
of
wyandots
led
by
the
resolute
timmendiquas
butler
was
in
general
command
of
the
whole
and
queen
esther
was
the
high
priestess
of
the
indians
continually
making
fiery
speeches
and
chanting
songs
that
made
the
warriors
see
red
upon
the
rear
of
this
extraordinary
army
hung
a
band
of
fierce
old
squaws
from
whom
every
remnant
of
mercy
and
gentleness
had
departed
from
a
high
rock
overlooking
a
valley
the
five
saw
force
start
for
its
final
march
upon
wyoming
it
was
composed
of
many
diverse
elements
and
perhaps
none
more
bloodthirsty
ever
trod
the
soil
of
america
in
some
preliminary
skirmish
a
son
of
queen
esther
had
been
slain
and
now
her
fury
knew
no
limits
she
took
her
place
at
the
very
head
of
the
army
whirling
her
great
tomahawk
about
her
head
and
neither
butler
nor
thayendanegea
dared
to
interfere
with
her
in
anything
great
or
small
henry
and
his
comrades
as
they
left
their
rock
and
hastened
toward
the
valley
of
wyoming
felt
that
now
they
were
coming
into
contact
with
the
great
war
itself
they
had
looked
upon
a
uniformed
enemy
for
the
first
time
and
they
might
soon
see
the
colonial
buff
and
blue
of
the
eastern
army
their
hearts
thrilled
high
at
new
scenes
and
new
dangers
they
had
gathered
at
pittsburgh
and
through
the
captivity
of
the
four
in
the
iroquois
camp
they
had
some
general
idea
of
the
wyoming
valley
and
the
direction
in
which
it
lay
and
taking
one
last
look
at
the
savage
army
they
sped
toward
it
the
time
was
the
close
of
june
and
the
foliage
was
still
dark
green
it
was
a
land
of
low
mountain
hill
rich
valley
and
clear
stream
and
it
was
beautiful
to
every
one
of
the
five
much
of
their
course
lay
along
the
susquehanna
and
soon
they
saw
signs
of
a
more
extended
cultivation
than
any
that
was
yet
to
be
witnessed
in
kentucky
from
the
brow
of
a
little
hill
they
beheld
a
field
of
green
and
in
another
field
a
man
plowing
wheat
said
tom
ross
we
ca
leave
the
man
to
plow
said
henry
he
never
harvest
that
wheat
we
warn
the
man
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
as
five
wild
figures
burst
into
his
field
he
stopped
abruptly
and
snatched
up
a
rifle
that
lay
across
the
plow
handles
neither
henry
nor
his
companions
realized
that
their
forest
garb
and
long
life
in
the
wilderness
made
them
look
more
like
indians
than
white
men
but
henry
threw
up
a
hand
as
a
sign
of
peace
white
like
yourselves
he
cried
we
come
to
warn
you
the
iroquois
and
the
tories
are
marching
into
the
valley
the
man
face
blanched
and
he
cast
a
hasty
look
toward
a
little
wood
where
stood
a
cabin
from
which
smoke
was
rising
he
could
not
doubt
on
a
near
view
that
these
were
white
like
himself
and
the
words
rang
true
house
is
strong
he
said
i
can
beat
them
off
maybe
you
will
help
help
you
willingly
enough
said
henry
this
were
any
ordinary
raiding
band
but
butler
brant
and
queen
esther
are
coming
at
the
head
of
twelve
or
fifteen
hundred
men
how
could
we
hold
a
house
no
matter
how
thick
its
walls
against
such
an
army
as
that
do
hesitate
a
moment
get
up
what
you
can
and
the
man
a
connecticut
was
his
his
plow
in
the
furrow
galloped
on
his
horse
to
his
house
mounted
his
wife
and
children
on
other
horses
and
taking
only
food
and
clothing
fled
to
stroudsburg
where
there
was
a
strong
fort
at
a
later
day
he
gave
henry
heartfelt
thanks
for
his
warning
as
six
hours
afterward
the
vanguard
of
the
horde
burned
his
home
and
raged
because
its
owner
and
his
family
were
gone
with
their
scalps
on
their
own
heads
the
five
were
now
well
into
the
wyoming
valley
where
the
until
they
were
pushed
westward
by
other
tribes
had
had
their
village
which
means
in
their
language
wyoming
it
was
a
beautiful
valley
running
twenty
miles
or
more
along
the
susquehanna
and
about
three
miles
broad
on
either
side
rose
mountain
walls
a
thousand
feet
in
height
and
further
away
were
peaks
with
mists
and
vapors
around
their
crests
the
valley
itself
blazed
in
the
summer
sunshine
and
the
river
sparkled
now
in
gold
now
in
silver
as
the
light
changed
and
fell
more
cultivated
fields
more
houses
generally
of
stout
logs
appeared
and
to
all
that
they
saw
the
five
bore
the
fiery
beacon
simon
jennings
was
not
the
only
man
who
lived
to
thank
them
for
the
warning
others
were
incredulous
and
soon
paid
the
terrible
price
of
unbelief
the
five
hastened
on
and
as
they
went
they
looked
about
them
with
wondering
were
so
many
houses
so
many
cultivated
fields
and
so
many
signs
of
a
numerous
population
they
had
emerged
almost
for
the
first
time
from
the
wilderness
excepting
their
memorable
visit
to
new
orleans
although
this
was
a
very
different
region
long
jim
spoke
of
it
think
i
like
it
better
here
than
at
new
he
said
found
some
nice
frenchmen
an
spaniards
down
thar
but
the
ground
feels
firmer
under
my
feet
ground
feels
firmer
said
paul
who
had
some
of
the
prescience
of
the
seer
the
skies
are
no
brighter
they
look
red
to
me
sometimes
tom
ross
glanced
at
paul
and
shook
his
head
ominously
a
woodsman
he
had
his
superstitions
and
paul
words
weighed
upon
his
mind
he
began
to
fear
a
great
disaster
and
his
experienced
eye
perceived
at
once
the
defenseless
state
of
the
valley
he
remembered
the
council
of
the
great
indian
force
in
the
deep
woods
and
the
terrible
face
of
queen
esther
was
again
before
him
people
ought
to
be
in
blockhouses
every
one
uv
he
said
ai
no
time
to
be
plowin
yet
peace
seemed
to
brood
still
over
the
valley
it
was
a
fine
river
beautiful
with
changing
colors
the
soil
on
either
side
was
as
deep
and
fertile
as
that
of
kentucky
and
the
line
of
the
mountains
cut
the
sky
sharp
and
clear
hills
and
slopes
were
dark
green
with
foliage
must
have
been
a
gran
huntin
ground
once
said
sol
the
alarm
that
the
five
gave
spread
fast
and
other
hunters
and
scouts
came
in
confirming
it
panic
seized
the
settlers
and
they
began
to
crowd
toward
forty
fort
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
henry
and
his
comrades
themselves
arrived
there
toward
the
close
of
evening
just
as
the
sun
had
set
blood
red
behind
the
mountains
some
report
of
them
had
preceded
their
coming
and
as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
they
were
summoned
to
the
presence
of
colonel
zebulon
butler
who
commanded
the
military
force
in
the
valley
singularly
enough
he
was
a
cousin
of
butler
who
led
the
invading
army
the
five
dressed
in
deerskin
hunting
shirts
leggins
and
moccasins
and
everyone
carrying
a
rifle
hatchet
and
knife
entered
a
large
low
room
dimly
lighted
by
some
wicks
burning
in
tallow
a
man
of
middle
years
with
a
keen
new
england
face
sat
at
a
little
table
and
several
others
of
varying
ages
stood
near
the
five
knew
instinctively
that
the
man
at
the
table
was
colonel
butler
and
they
bowed
but
they
did
not
show
the
faintest
trace
of
subservience
they
had
caught
suspicious
glances
from
some
of
the
officers
who
stood
about
the
commander
and
they
stiffened
at
once
colonel
butler
looked
involuntarily
at
always
took
him
without
the
telling
for
leader
of
the
group
have
had
report
of
you
he
said
in
cool
noncommittal
tones
you
have
been
telling
of
great
indian
councils
that
you
have
seen
in
the
woods
may
i
ask
your
name
and
where
you
belong
name
replied
henry
with
dignity
henry
ware
and
i
come
from
kentucky
my
friends
here
are
paul
cotter
solomon
hyde
tom
ross
and
jim
hart
they
too
come
from
several
of
the
men
gave
the
five
suspicious
glances
certainly
they
were
wild
enough
in
appearance
and
kentucky
was
far
away
it
would
seem
strange
that
new
settlers
in
that
far
land
should
be
here
in
pennsylvania
henry
saw
clearly
that
his
story
was
doubted
you
tell
me
said
colonel
butler
you
mean
to
say
you
have
come
all
that
tremendous
distance
to
warn
us
of
an
attack
by
indians
and
tories
several
of
the
others
murmured
approval
and
henry
flushed
a
little
but
he
saw
that
the
commander
was
not
unreasonable
it
was
a
time
when
men
might
well
question
the
words
of
strangers
remembering
this
he
replied
we
did
not
come
from
kentucky
just
to
warn
you
in
fact
we
came
from
a
point
much
farther
than
that
we
came
from
new
orleans
to
pittsburgh
with
a
fleet
loaded
with
supplies
for
the
continental
armies
and
commanded
by
adam
colfax
of
new
the
face
of
colonel
butler
brightened
he
exclaimed
were
on
that
expedition
it
seems
to
me
that
i
recall
hearing
of
great
services
rendered
to
it
by
some
independent
we
reached
pittsburgh
continued
henry
was
our
first
intention
to
go
back
to
kentucky
but
we
heard
that
a
great
war
movement
was
in
progress
to
the
eastward
and
we
thought
that
we
would
see
what
was
going
on
four
of
us
have
been
captives
among
the
iroquois
we
know
much
of
their
plans
and
we
know
too
that
timmendiquas
the
great
chief
of
the
wyandots
whom
we
fought
along
the
ohio
has
joined
them
with
a
hand
of
his
best
warriors
we
have
also
seen
thayendanegea
every
one
of
have
seen
brant
exclaimed
colonel
butler
calling
the
great
mohawk
by
his
white
name
replied
henry
have
seen
him
and
we
have
also
seen
the
woman
they
call
queen
esther
she
is
continually
urging
the
indians
colonel
butler
seemed
convinced
and
invited
them
to
sit
down
he
also
introduced
the
officers
who
were
with
him
colonel
john
durkee
colonel
nathan
dennison
lieutenant
colonel
george
dorrance
major
john
garrett
captain
samuel
ransom
captain
dethrie
hewitt
and
some
others
gentlemen
tell
us
all
that
you
saw
continued
colonel
butler
courteously
will
pardon
so
many
questions
but
we
must
be
careful
you
will
see
that
yourselves
but
i
am
a
new
england
man
myself
from
connecticut
and
i
have
met
adam
colfax
i
recall
now
that
we
have
heard
of
you
also
and
we
are
grateful
for
your
coming
will
you
and
your
comrades
tell
us
all
that
you
have
seen
and
heard
the
five
felt
a
decided
change
in
the
atmosphere
they
were
no
longer
possible
tories
or
renegades
bringing
an
alarm
at
one
point
when
it
should
be
dreaded
at
another
the
men
drew
closely
around
them
and
listened
as
the
tallow
wicks
sputtered
in
the
dim
room
henry
spoke
first
and
the
others
in
their
turn
every
one
of
them
spoke
tersely
but
vividly
in
the
language
of
the
forest
they
felt
deeply
what
they
had
seen
and
they
drew
the
same
picture
for
their
listeners
gradually
the
faces
of
the
wyoming
men
became
shadowed
this
was
a
formidable
tale
that
they
were
hearing
and
they
could
not
doubt
its
truth
is
worse
than
i
thought
it
could
be
said
colonel
butler
at
last
many
men
do
you
say
they
have
ware
to
fifteen
trained
warriors
and
soldiers
and
at
the
best
we
can
not
raise
more
than
three
hundreds
including
old
men
and
boys
and
our
men
too
are
we
can
beat
them
only
give
us
a
chance
colonel
exclaimed
captain
ransom
afraid
the
chance
will
come
too
soon
said
colonel
butler
and
then
turning
to
the
five
us
all
you
can
we
need
scouts
and
riflemen
come
to
the
fort
for
any
food
and
ammunition
you
may
the
five
gave
their
most
earnest
assurances
that
they
would
stay
and
do
all
in
their
power
in
fact
they
had
come
for
that
very
purpose
satisfied
now
that
colonel
butler
and
his
officers
had
implicit
faith
in
them
they
went
forth
to
find
that
despite
the
night
and
the
darkness
fugitives
were
already
crossing
the
river
to
seek
refuge
in
forty
fort
bringing
with
them
tales
of
death
and
devastation
some
of
which
were
exaggerated
but
too
many
true
in
all
their
hideous
details
men
had
been
shot
and
scalped
in
the
fields
houses
were
burning
women
and
children
were
captives
for
a
fate
that
no
one
could
foretell
red
ruin
was
already
stalking
down
the
valley
the
farmers
were
bringing
their
wives
and
children
in
canoes
and
dugouts
across
the
river
here
and
there
a
torch
light
flickered
on
the
surface
of
the
stream
showing
the
pale
faces
of
the
women
and
children
too
frightened
to
cry
they
had
fled
in
haste
bringing
with
them
only
the
clothes
they
wore
and
maybe
a
blanket
or
two
the
borderers
knew
too
well
what
indian
war
was
with
all
its
accompaniments
of
fire
and
the
stake
henry
and
his
comrades
helped
nearly
all
that
night
they
secured
a
large
boat
and
crossed
the
river
again
and
again
guarding
the
fugitives
with
their
rifles
and
bringing
comfort
to
many
a
timid
heart
indian
bands
had
penetrated
far
into
the
wyoming
valley
but
they
felt
sure
that
none
were
yet
in
the
neighborhood
of
forty
fort
it
was
about
three
in
the
morning
when
the
last
of
the
fugitives
who
had
yet
come
was
inside
forty
fort
and
the
labors
of
the
five
had
they
so
chosen
were
over
for
the
time
but
their
nerves
were
tuned
to
so
high
a
pitch
and
they
felt
so
powerfully
the
presence
of
danger
that
they
could
not
rest
nor
did
they
have
any
desire
for
sleep
the
boat
in
which
they
sat
was
a
good
one
with
two
pairs
of
oars
it
had
been
detailed
for
their
service
and
they
decided
to
pull
up
the
river
they
thought
it
possible
that
they
might
see
the
advance
of
the
enemy
and
bring
news
worth
the
telling
long
jim
and
tom
ross
took
the
oars
and
their
powerful
arms
sent
the
boat
swiftly
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
western
bank
henry
and
paul
looked
back
and
saw
dim
lights
at
the
fort
and
a
few
on
either
shore
the
valley
the
high
mountain
wall
and
everything
else
were
merged
in
obscurity
both
the
youths
were
oppressed
heavily
by
the
sense
of
danger
not
for
themselves
but
for
others
in
that
kentucky
of
theirs
yet
so
new
few
people
lived
beyond
the
palisades
but
here
were
rich
and
scattered
settlements
and
men
even
in
the
face
of
great
peril
are
always
loth
to
abandon
the
homes
that
they
have
built
with
so
much
toil
tom
ross
and
long
jim
continued
to
pull
steadily
with
the
long
strokes
that
did
not
tire
them
and
the
lights
of
the
fort
and
houses
sank
out
of
sight
before
them
lay
the
somber
surface
of
the
rippling
river
the
shadowy
hills
and
silence
the
world
seemed
given
over
to
the
night
save
for
themselves
but
they
knew
too
well
to
trust
to
such
apparent
desertion
at
such
hours
the
indian
scouts
come
and
henry
did
not
doubt
that
they
were
already
near
gathering
news
of
their
victims
for
the
indian
and
tory
horde
therefore
it
was
the
part
of
his
comrades
and
himself
to
use
the
utmost
caution
as
they
passed
up
the
river
they
bugged
the
western
shore
where
they
were
shadowed
by
banks
and
bushes
and
now
they
went
slowly
long
jim
and
tom
ross
drawing
their
oars
so
carefully
through
the
water
that
there
was
never
a
plash
to
tell
of
their
passing
henry
was
in
the
prow
of
the
boat
bent
forward
a
little
eyes
searching
the
surface
of
the
river
and
ears
intent
upon
any
sound
that
might
pass
on
the
bank
suddenly
he
gave
a
little
signal
to
the
rowers
and
they
let
their
oars
rest
the
boat
in
closer
to
the
bank
he
whispered
it
gently
among
those
bushes
where
we
can
not
be
seen
from
tom
and
jim
obeyed
the
boat
slid
softly
among
tall
bushes
that
shadowed
the
water
and
was
hidden
completely
then
henry
stepped
out
crept
cautiously
nearly
up
the
bank
which
was
here
very
low
and
lay
pressed
closely
against
the
earth
but
supported
by
the
exposed
root
of
a
tree
he
had
heard
voices
those
of
indians
he
believed
and
he
wished
to
see
peering
through
a
fringe
of
bushes
that
lined
the
bank
he
saw
seven
warriors
and
one
white
face
sitting
under
the
boughs
of
a
great
oak
the
face
was
that
of
braxton
wyatt
who
was
now
in
his
element
with
a
better
prospect
of
success
than
any
that
he
had
ever
known
before
henry
shuddered
and
for
a
moment
he
regretted
that
he
had
spared
wyatt
life
when
he
might
have
taken
it
but
henry
was
lying
against
the
bank
to
hear
what
these
men
might
be
saying
not
to
slay
two
of
the
warriors
as
he
saw
by
their
paint
were
wyandots
and
he
understood
the
wyandot
tongue
moreover
his
slight
knowledge
of
iroquois
came
into
service
and
gradually
he
gathered
the
drift
of
their
talk
two
miles
nearer
forty
fort
was
a
farmhouse
one
of
the
wyandots
had
seen
yet
abandoned
by
its
owner
who
believed
that
his
proximity
to
forty
fort
assured
his
safety
he
lived
there
with
his
wife
and
five
children
and
wyatt
and
the
indians
planned
to
raid
the
place
before
daylight
and
kill
them
all
henry
had
heard
enough
he
slid
back
from
the
bank
to
the
water
and
crept
into
the
boat
back
down
the
river
as
gently
as
you
can
he
whispered
then
i
tell
the
skilled
oarsmen
carried
the
boat
without
a
splash
several
hundred
yards
down
the
stream
and
then
henry
told
the
others
of
the
fiendish
plan
that
he
had
heard
know
that
man
said
sol
name
is
standish
i
was
there
nine
or
ten
hours
ago
an

told
him

his
family

run
but
he
knowed
more
i
did
said
he
stay
he
afraid
an
now
he
got
to
pay
the
he
must
do
that
said
henry
too
much
to
pay
for
just
being
foolish
when
everybody
is
foolish
sometimes
boys
we
can
yet
save
that
man
an
his
wife
and
children
are
you
willing
to
do
it
course
said
long
jim
ez
not
standish
will
shoot
at
us
when
we
knock
on
his
door
but
let
try
the
others
nodded
assent
far
back
from
the
river
is
the
standish
house
sol
asked
henry
three
hundred
yards
i

and
it
ai
more
a
mile
if

all
our
might
we
wo
be
too
late
tom
you
and
jim
give
sol
and
me
the
oars
henry
and
the
shiftless
one
were
fresh
and
they
sent
the
boat
shooting
down
stream
until
they
stopped
at
a
point
indicated
by
sol
they
leaped
ashore
drew
the
boat
down
the
bank
and
hastened
toward
a
log
house
that
they
saw
standing
in
a
clump
of
trees
the
enemy
had
not
yet
come
but
as
they
swiftly
approached
the
house
a
dog
ran
barking
at
them
the
shiftless
one
swung
his
rifle
butt
and
the
dog
fell
unconscious
hated
to
do
it
but
i
had
to
he
murmured
the
next
moment
henry
was
knocking
at
the
door
up
he
cried
indians
are
at
hand
and
you
must
run
for
your
lives
how
many
a
time
has
that
terrible
cry
been
heard
on
the
american
border
the
sound
of
a
man
voice
startled
and
angry
came
to
their
ears
and
then
they
heard
him
at
the
door
are
you
he
cried
are
you
beating
on
my
door
at
such
a
time
are
friends
standish
cried
henry
if
you
would
save
your
wife
and
children
you
must
go
at
once
open
the
door
open
i
say
the
man
inside
was
in
a
terrible
quandary
it
was
thus
that
renegades
or
indians
speaking
the
white
man
tongue
sometimes
bade
a
door
to
be
opened
in
order
that
they
might
find
an
easy
path
to
slaughter
but
the
voice
outside
was
powerfully
insistent
it
had
the
note
of
truth
his
wife
and
children
roused
too
were
crying
out
in
alarm
henry
knocked
again
on
the
door
and
shouted
to
him
in
a
voice
always
increasing
in
earnestness
to
open
and
flee
standish
could
resist
no
longer
he
took
down
the
bar
and
flung
open
the
door
springing
back
startled
at
the
five
figures
that
stood
before
him
in
the
dusk
he
did
not
remember
sol
standish
henry
said
speaking
rapidly
are
as
you
can
see
white
you
will
be
attacked
here
by
indians
and
renegades
within
half
an
hour
we
know
that
because
we
heard
them
talking
from
the
bushes
we
have
a
boat
in
the
river
you
can
reach
it
in
five
minutes
take
your
wife
and
children
and
pull
for
forty
standish
was
bewildered
do
i
know
that
you
are
not
enemies
renegades
yourselves
he
asked
we
had
been
that
you
be
a
dead
man
already
said
sol
it
was
a
grim
reply
but
it
was
unanswerable
and
standish
recognized
the
fact
his
wife
had
felt
the
truth
in
the
tones
of
the
strangers
and
was
begging
him
to
go
their
children
were
crying
at
visions
of
the
tomahawk
and
scalping
knife
now
so
near
go
said
standish
any
rate
it
ca
do
any
harm
we
get
a
few
things
not
wait
for
anything
exclaimed
henry
have
a
minute
to
spare
here
are
more
blankets
take
them
and
run
for
the
boat
sol
and
jim
see
them
on
board
and
then
come
back
carried
away
by
such
fire
and
earnestness
standish
and
his
family
ran
for
the
boat
jim
and
the
shiftless
one
almost
threw
them
on
board
thrust
a
pair
of
oars
into
the
bands
of
standish
another
into
the
hands
of
his
wife
and
then
told
them
to
pull
with
all
their
might
for
the
fort
you
cried
standish
becomes
of
you
then
a
singular
expression
passed
over
his
had
guessed
plan
you
trouble
about
us
said
the
shiftless
one
will
come
later
now
pull
pull
standish
and
his
wife
swung
on
the
oars
and
in
two
minutes
the
boat
and
its
occupants
were
lost
in
the
darkness
tom
ross
and
sol
did
not
pause
to
watch
them
but
ran
swiftly
back
to
the
house
henry
was
at
the
door
in
he
said
briefly
and
they
entered
then
he
closed
the
door
and
dropped
the
bar
into
place
sol
and
paul
were
already
inside
one
sitting
on
the
chair
and
the
other
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
some
coals
almost
hidden
under
ashes
smoldered
and
cast
a
faint
light
in
the
room
the
only
one
that
the
house
had
although
it
was
divided
into
two
parts
by
a
rough
homespun
curtain
henry
opened
one
of
the
window
shutters
a
little
and
looked
out
the
dawn
had
not
yet
come
but
it
was
not
a
dark
night
and
he
looked
over
across
the
little
clearing
to
the
trees
beyond
on
that
side
was
a
tiny
garden
and
near
the
wall
of
the
house
some
roses
were
blooming
he
could
see
the
glow
of
pink
and
red
but
no
enemy
bad
yet
approached
searching
the
clearing
carefully
with
those
eyes
of
his
almost
preternaturally
keen
he
was
confident
that
the
indians
were
still
in
the
woods
he
felt
an
intense
thrill
of
satisfaction
at
the
success
of
his
plan
so
far
he
was
not
cruel
he
never
rejoiced
in
bloodshed
but
the
borderer
alone
knew
what
the
border
suffered
and
only
those
who
never
saw
or
felt
the
torture
could
turn
the
other
cheek
to
be
smitten
the
standish
house
had
made
a
sudden
and
ominous
change
of
tenants
will
soon
be
day
said
henry
farmers
are
early
risers
kindle
up
that
fire
a
little
will
you
sol
i
want
some
smoke
to
come
out
of
the
the
shiftless
one
raked
away
the
ashes
and
put
on
two
or
three
pieces
of
wood
that
lay
on
the
hearth
little
flames
and
smoke
arose
henry
looked
curiously
about
the
house
it
was
the
usual
cabin
of
the
frontier
although
somewhat
larger
the
bed
on
which
sol
sat
was
evidently
that
of
the
father
and
mother
while
two
large
ones
behind
the
curtain
were
used
by
the
children
on
the
shelf
stood
a
pail
half
full
of
drinking
water
and
by
the
side
of
it
a
tin
cup
dried
herbs
hung
over
the
fireplace
and
two
or
three
chests
stood
in
the
corners
the
clothing
of
the
children
was
scattered
about
unprepared
food
for
breakfast
stood
on
a
table
everything
told
of
a
hasty
flight
and
its
terrible
need
henry
was
already
resolved
but
his
heart
hardened
within
him
as
he
saw
he
took
the
hatchet
from
his
belt
and
cut
one
of
the
hooks
for
the
door
bar
nearly
in
two
the
others
said
not
a
word
they
had
no
need
to
speak
they
understood
everything
that
he
did
he
opened
the
window
again
and
looked
out
nothing
yet
appeared
dawn
will
come
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
he
said
we
shall
not
have
to
wait
long
for
what
we
want
to
he
sat
down
facing
the
door
all
the
others
were
sitting
and
they
too
faced
the
door
everyone
had
his
rifle
across
his
knees
with
one
hand
upon
the
hammer
the
wood
on
the
hearth
sputtered
as
the
fire
spread
and
the
flames
grew
beyond
a
doubt
a
thin
spire
of
smoke
was
rising
from
the
chimney
and
a
watching
eye
would
see
this
sign
of
a
peaceful
and
unsuspecting
mind
hope
braxton
wyatt
will
be
the
first
to
knock
at
our
door
said
sol
would
be
sorry
said
henry
paul
was
sitting
in
a
chair
near
the
fire
and
he
said
nothing
he
hoped
the
waiting
would
be
very
short
the
light
was
sufficient
for
him
to
see
the
faces
of
his
comrades
and
he
noticed
that
they
were
all
very
tense
this
was
no
common
watch
that
they
kept
sol
remained
on
the
bed
henry
sat
on
another
of
the
chairs
tom
ross
was
on
one
of
the
chests
with
his
back
to
the
wall
long
jim
was
near
the
curtain
close
by
paul
was
a
cradle
he
put
down
his
hand
and
touched
it
he
was
glad
that
it
was
empty
now
but
the
sight
of
it
steeled
his
heart
anew
for
the
task
that
lay
before
them
ten
silent
minutes
passed
and
henry
went
to
the
window
again
he
did
not
open
it
but
there
was
a
crack
through
which
he
could
see
the
others
said
nothing
but
watched
his
face
when
he
turned
away
they
knew
that
the
moment
was
at
hand
just
come
from
the
woods
he
said
in
a
minute
they
be
at
the
door
now
boys
take
one
last
look
at
your
a
minute
later
there
was
a
sudden
sharp
knock
at
the
door
but
no
answer
came
from
within
the
knock
was
repeated
sharper
and
louder
and
henry
altering
his
voice
as
much
as
possible
exclaimed
like
one
suddenly
awakened
from
sleep
is
it
what
do
you
want
back
came
a
voice
which
henry
knew
to
be
that
of
braxton
wyatt
come
from
farther
up
the
valley
we
scouts
we
been
up
to
the
indian
country
we
half
starved
open
and
give
us
food
do
believe
you
replied
henry
people
do
come
to
my
door
at
this
time
in
the
then
ensued
a
few
moments
of
silence
although
paul
with
his
vivid
fancy
thought
he
heard
whispering
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
cried
wyatt
we
break
your
door
down
henry
said
nothing
nor
did
any
of
the
others
they
did
not
stir
the
fire
crackled
a
little
but
there
was
no
other
sound
in
the
standish
house
presently
they
heard
a
slight
noise
outside
that
of
light
feet
are
going
for
a
log
with
which
to
break
the
door
in
whispered
henry
wo
have
to
look
far
the
wood
pile
is
fifty
feet
then
said
sol
wo
have
much
left
to
do
but
to
take
the
scalps
of
women
an
little
every
figure
in
the
standish
house
stiffened
at
the
shiftless
significant
words
and
the
light
in
the
eyes
grew
sterner
henry
went
to
the
door
put
his
ear
to
the
line
where
it
joined
the
wall
and
listened
got
their
log
he
said
in
half
a
minute
they
rush
it
against
the
he
came
back
to
his
old
position
paul
heart
began
to
thump
and
his
thumb
fitted
itself
over
the
trigger
of
his
cocked
rifle
then
they
heard
rapid
feet
a
smash
a
crash
and
the
door
flew
open
a
half
dozen
iroquois
and
a
log
that
they
held
between
them
were
hurled
into
the
middle
of
the
room
the
door
had
given
away
so
easily
and
unexpectedly
that
the
warriors
could
not
check
themselves
and
two
or
three
fell
with
the
log
but
they
sprang
like
cats
to
their
feet
and
with
their
comrades
uttered
a
cry
that
filled
the
whole
cabin
with
its
terrible
sound
and
import
the
iroquois
keen
of
eyes
and
quick
of
mind
saw
the
trap
at
once
the
five
grim
figures
rifle
in
hand
and
finger
on
trigger
all
waiting
silent
and
motionless
were
far
different
from
what
they
expected
here
could
be
no
scalps
with
the
long
silky
hair
of
women
and
children
there
was
a
moment
pause
and
then
the
indians
rushed
at
their
foes
five
fingers
pulled
triggers
flame
leaped
from
five
muzzles
and
in
an
instant
the
cabin
was
filled
with
smoke
and
war
shouts
but
the
warriors
never
had
a
chance
they
could
only
strike
blindly
with
their
tomahawks
and
in
a
half
minute
three
of
them
two
wounded
rushed
through
the
door
and
fled
to
the
woods
they
had
been
preceded
already
by
braxton
wyatt
who
had
hung
back
craftily
while
the
iroquois
broke
down
the
door
chapter
ix
wyoming
the
five
made
no
attempt
to
pursue
in
fact
they
did
not
leave
the
cabin
but
stood
there
a
while
looking
down
at
the
fallen
hideous
with
war
paint
but
now
at
the
end
of
their
last
trail
their
tomahawks
lay
upon
the
floor
and
glittered
when
the
light
from
the
fire
fell
upon
them
smoke
heavy
with
the
odor
of
burned
gunpowder
drifted
about
the
room
henry
threw
open
the
two
shuttered
windows
and
fresh
currents
of
air
poured
into
the
room
over
the
mountains
in
the
east
came
the
first
shaft
of
day
the
surface
of
the
river
was
lightening
shall
we
do
with
them
asked
paul
pointing
to
the
silent
forms
on
the
floor
them
said
henry
army
is
burning
everything
before
it
and
this
house
and
all
in
it
is
bound
to
go
you
notice
however
that
braxton
wyatt
is
not
him
to
escape
every
time
said
sol
course
he
stood
back
while
the
indians
rushed
the
house
but
ez
shore
ez
we
live
somebody
will
get
him
some
day
people
like
that
ca
escape
they
slipped
from
the
house
turning
toward
the
river
bank
and
not
long
after
it
was
full
daylight
they
were
at
forty
fort
again
where
they
found
standish
and
his
family
henry
replied
briefly
to
the
questions
but
two
hours
later
a
scout
came
in
and
reported
the
grim
sight
that
he
had
seen
in
the
standish
home
no
one
could
ask
for
further
proof
of
the
fealty
of
the
five
who
sought
a
little
sleep
but
before
noon
were
off
again
they
met
more
fugitives
and
it
was
now
too
dangerous
to
go
farther
up
the
valley
but
not
willing
to
turn
back
they
ascended
the
mountains
that
hem
it
in
and
from
the
loftiest
point
that
they
could
find
sought
a
sight
of
the
enemy
it
was
an
absolutely
brilliant
day
in
summer
the
blue
of
the
heavens
showed
no
break
but
the
shifting
bits
of
white
cloud
and
the
hills
and
mountains
rolled
away
solid
masses
of
rich
dark
green
the
river
a
beautiful
river
at
any
time
seemed
from
this
height
a
great
current
of
quicksilver
henry
pointed
to
a
place
far
up
the
stream
where
black
dots
appeared
on
its
surface
these
dots
were
moving
and
they
came
on
in
four
lines
he
said
know
what
those
lines
of
black
dots
are
replied
sol
butler
army
of
indians
tories
canadians
an
english
they
come
from
tioga
point
on
the
river
our
colonel
butler
kin
expect
the
sunlight
became
dazzling
and
showed
the
boats
despite
the
distance
with
startling
clearness
the
five
watching
from
their
peak
saw
them
turn
in
toward
the
land
where
they
poured
forth
a
motley
stream
of
red
men
and
white
a
stream
that
was
quickly
swallowed
up
in
the
forest
are
coming
down
through
the
woods
on
the
fort
said
tom
ross
they
coming
fast
said
henry
for
us
to
carry
the
they
sped
back
to
the
wyoming
fort
spreading
the
alarm
as
they
passed
and
once
more
they
were
in
the
council
room
with
colonel
zebulon
butler
and
his
officers
around
him
they
are
at
hand
and
you
have
seen
them
said
the
colonel
replied
henry
the
spokesman
came
down
from
tioga
point
in
boats
but
have
disembarked
and
are
advancing
through
the
woods
they
will
be
here
there
was
a
little
silence
in
the
room
the
older
men
understood
the
danger
perhaps
better
than
the
younger
who
were
eager
for
battle
should
we
stay
here
and
wait
for
them
exclaimed
one
of
the
younger
captains
at
of
these
captains
were
mere
boys
not
go
out
meet
them
and
beat
them
outnumber
us
about
five
to
one
said
henry
if
he
is
still
with
them
though
he
may
have
gone
to
some
other
place
from
tioga
point
is
a
great
captain
so
is
timmendiquas
the
wyandot
and
they
say
that
the
tory
leader
is
energetic
and
is
all
true
exclaimed
colonel
butler
must
stay
in
the
fort
we
must
not
go
out
to
meet
them
we
are
not
strong
enough
a
murmur
of
protest
and
indignation
came
from
the
younger
officers
leave
the
valley
to
be
ravaged
women
and
children
to
be
scalped
while
we
stay
behind
log
walls
said
one
of
them
boldly
the
men
in
the
wyoming
fort
were
not
regular
troops
merely
militia
farmers
gathered
hastily
for
their
own
defense
colonel
butler
flushed
have
induced
as
many
as
we
could
to
seek
refuge
he
said
hurts
me
as
much
as
you
to
have
the
valley
ravaged
while
we
sit
quiet
here
but
i
know
that
we
have
no
chance
against
so
large
a
force
and
if
we
fall
what
is
to
become
of
the
hundreds
whom
we
now
protect
but
the
murmur
of
protest
grew
all
the
younger
men
were
indignant
they
would
not
seek
shelter
for
themselves
while
others
were
suffering
a
young
lieutenant
saw
from
a
window
two
fires
spring
up
and
burn
like
torch
lights
against
the
sky
they
were
houses
blazing
before
the
indian
brand
at
that
he
cried
pointing
with
an
accusing
finger
we
are
here
under
cover
doing
nothing
a
deep
angry
mutter
went
about
the
room
but
colonel
butler
although
the
flush
remained
on
his
face
still
shook
his
head
he
glanced
at
tom
ross
the
oldest
of
the
five
know
about
the
indian
force
he
exclaimed
should
we
do
the
face
of
tom
ross
was
very
grave
and
he
spoke
slowly
as
was
his
wont
a
hard
thing
to
set
here
he
exclaimed
it
will
be
harder
to
go
out
an
meet
on
their
own
ground
an
them
four
or
five
to
must
not
go
out
repeated
the
colonel
glad
of
such
backing
the
door
was
thrust
open
and
an
officer
entered
rumor
has
just
arrived
saying
that
the
entire
davidson
family
has
been
killed
and
scalped
he
said
a
deep
angry
cry
went
up
colonel
butler
and
the
few
who
stood
with
him
were
overborne
such
things
as
these
could
not
be
endured
and
reluctantly
the
commander
gave
his
consent
they
would
go
out
and
fight
the
fort
and
its
enclosures
were
soon
filled
with
the
sounds
of
preparation
and
the
little
army
was
formed
rapidly
will
fight
by
your
side
of
course
said
henry
we
wish
to
serve
on
the
flank
as
an
independent
band
we
can
be
of
more
service
in
that
the
colonel
thanked
them
gratefully
as
you
think
best
he
said
the
five
stood
near
one
of
the
gates
while
the
little
force
formed
in
ranks
almost
for
the
first
time
they
were
gloomy
upon
going
into
battle
they
had
seen
the
strength
of
that
army
of
indians
renegades
tories
canadians
and
english
advancing
under
the
banner
of
england
and
they
knew
the
power
and
fanaticism
of
the
indian
leaders
they
believed
that
the
terrible
queen
esther
tomahawk
in
hand
had
continually
chanted
to
them
her
songs
of
blood
as
they
came
down
the
river
it
was
now
the
third
of
july
and
valley
and
river
were
beautiful
in
the
golden
sunlight
the
foliage
showed
vivid
and
deep
green
on
either
line
of
high
hills
the
summer
sun
had
never
shown
more
kindly
over
the
lovely
valley
the
time
was
now
three
the
gates
of
the
fort
were
thrown
open
and
the
little
army
marched
out
only
three
hundred
of
whom
seventy
were
old
men
or
boys
so
young
that
in
our
day
they
would
be
called
children
yet
they
marched
bravely
against
the
picked
warriors
of
the
iroquois
trained
from
infancy
to
the
forest
and
war
and
a
formidable
body
of
white
rovers
who
wished
to
destroy
the
little
colony
of
as
they
called
them
small
though
it
might
be
it
was
a
gallant
army
young
and
old
held
their
heads
high
a
banner
was
flying
and
a
boy
beat
a
steady
insistent
roll
upon
a
drum
henry
and
his
comrades
were
on
the
left
flank
the
river
was
on
the
right
the
great
gates
had
closed
behind
them
shutting
in
the
women
and
the
children
the
sun
blazed
down
throwing
everything
into
relief
with
its
intense
vivid
light
playing
upon
the
brown
faces
of
the
borderers
their
rifles
and
their
homespun
clothes
colonel
butler
and
two
or
three
of
his
officers
were
on
horseback
leading
the
van
now
that
the
decision
was
to
fight
the
older
officers
who
had
opposed
it
were
in
the
very
front
forward
they
went
and
spread
out
a
little
but
with
the
right
flank
still
resting
on
the
river
and
the
left
extended
on
the
plain
the
five
were
on
the
edge
of
the
plain
a
little
detached
from
the
others
searching
the
forest
for
a
sign
of
the
enemy
who
was
already
so
near
their
gloom
did
not
decrease
neither
the
rolling
of
the
drum
nor
the
flaunting
of
the
banner
had
any
effect
brave
though
the
men
might
be
this
was
not
the
way
in
which
they
should
meet
an
indian
foe
who
outnumbered
them
four
or
five
to
one
do
like
it
muttered
tom
ross
do
i
said
henry
remember
that
whatever
happens
we
all
stand
remember
said
the
others
went
and
the
five
moving
faster
were
now
ahead
of
the
main
force
some
hundred
yards
they
swung
in
a
little
toward
the
river
the
banks
here
were
highland
off
to
the
left
was
a
large
swamp
the
five
now
checked
speed
and
moved
with
great
wariness
they
saw
nothing
and
they
heard
nothing
either
until
they
went
forty
or
fifty
yards
farther
then
a
low
droning
sound
came
to
their
ears
it
was
the
voice
of
one
yet
far
away
but
they
knew
it
it
was
the
terrible
chant
of
queen
esther
in
this
moment
the
most
ruthless
of
all
the
savages
and
inflaming
them
continuously
for
the
combat
the
five
threw
themselves
flat
on
their
faces
and
waited
a
little
the
chant
grew
louder
and
then
through
the
foliage
they
saw
the
ominous
figure
approaching
she
was
much
as
she
had
been
on
that
night
when
they
first
beheld
her
she
wore
the
same
dress
of
barbaric
colors
she
swung
the
same
great
tomahawk
about
her
head
and
sang
all
the
time
of
fire
and
blood
and
death
they
saw
behind
her
the
figures
of
chiefs
naked
to
the
breech
cloth
for
battle
their
bronze
bodies
glistening
with
the
war
paint
and
bright
feathers
gleaming
in
their
hair
henry
recognized
the
tall
form
of
timmendiquas
notable
by
his
height
and
around
him
his
little
band
of
wyandots
ready
to
prove
themselves
mighty
warriors
to
their
eastern
friends
the
iroquois
back
of
these
was
a
long
line
of
indians
and
their
white
allies
sir
john
johnson
royal
greens
and
butler
rangers
in
the
center
bearing
the
flag
of
england
the
warriors
of
whom
the
senecas
were
most
numerous
were
gathered
in
greatest
numbers
on
their
right
flank
facing
the
left
flank
of
the
americans
sangerachte
and
hiokatoo
who
had
taken
two
english
prisoners
at
braddock
defeat
and
who
had
afterwards
burned
them
both
alive
with
his
own
hand
were
the
principal
leaders
of
the
senecas
henry
caught
a
glimpse
of
butler
in
the
center
with
a
great
handkerchief
tied
around
his
head
and
despite
the
forest
he
noticed
with
a
great
sinking
of
the
heart
how
far
the
hostile
line
extended
it
could
wrap
itself
like
a
python
around
the
defense
a
tale
that
will
soon
be
told
said
paul
they
went
back
swiftly
and
warned
colonel
butler
that
the
enemy
was
at
band
even
as
they
spoke
they
heard
the
loud
wailing
chant
of
queen
esther
and
then
came
the
war
whoop
pouring
from
a
thousand
throats
swelling
defiant
and
fierce
like
the
cry
of
a
wounded
beast
the
farmers
the
boys
and
the
old
men
most
of
whom
had
never
been
in
battle
might
well
tremble
at
this
ominous
sound
so
great
in
volume
and
extending
so
far
into
the
forest
but
they
stood
firm
drawing
themselves
into
a
somewhat
more
compact
body
and
still
advancing
with
their
banners
flying
and
the
boy
beating
out
that
steady
roll
on
the
drum
the
enemy
now
came
into
full
sight
and
colonel
butler
deployed
his
force
in
line
of
battle
his
right
resting
on
the
high
bank
of
the
river
and
his
left
against
the
swamp
forward
pressed
the
motley
army
of
the
other
butler
he
of
sanguinary
and
cruel
fame
and
the
bulk
of
his
force
came
into
view
the
sun
shining
down
on
the
green
uniforms
of
the
english
and
the
naked
brown
bodies
of
the
iroquois
the
american
commander
gave
the
order
to
fire
eager
fingers
were
already
on
the
trigger
and
a
blaze
of
light
ran
along
the
entire
rank
the
royal
greens
and
rangers
although
replying
with
their
own
fire
gave
back
before
the
storm
of
bullets
and
the
wyoming
men
with
a
shout
of
triumph
sprang
forward
it
was
always
a
characteristic
of
the
border
settler
despite
many
disasters
and
a
knowledge
of
indian
craft
and
cunning
to
rush
straight
at
his
foe
whenever
he
saw
him
his
unless
a
trained
forest
warrior
himself
was
a
headlong
bravery
and
now
this
gallant
little
force
asked
for
nothing
but
to
come
to
close
grips
with
the
enemy
the
men
in
the
center
with
butler
gave
back
still
more
with
cries
of
victory
the
wyoming
men
pressed
forward
firing
rapidly
and
continuing
to
drive
the
mongrel
white
force
the
rifles
were
cracking
rapidly
and
smoke
arose
over
the
two
lines
the
wind
caught
wisps
of
it
and
carried
them
off
down
the
river
goes
better
than
i
thought
said
paul
as
he
reloaded
his
rifle
yet
said
henry
are
fighting
the
white
men
only
where
are
all
the
indians
who
alone
outnumber
our
men
more
than
two
to
one
they
come
said
sol
pointing
to
the
depths
of
the
swamp
which
was
supposed
to
protect
the
left
flank
of
the
wyoming
force
the
five
saw
in
the
spaces
amid
the
briars
and
vines
scores
of
dark
figures
leaping
over
the
mud
naked
to
the
breech
cloth
armed
with
rifle
and
tomahawk
and
rushing
down
upon
the
unprotected
side
of
their
foe
the
swamp
had
been
but
little
obstacle
to
them
henry
and
his
comrades
gave
the
alarm
at
once
as
many
as
possible
were
called
off
immediately
from
the
main
body
but
they
were
not
numerous
enough
to
have
any
effect
the
indians
came
through
the
swamp
in
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
as
they
uttered
their
triumphant
yell
poured
a
terrible
fire
into
the
wyoming
left
flank
the
defenders
were
forced
to
give
ground
and
the
english
and
tories
came
on
again
the
fire
was
now
deadly
and
of
great
volume
the
air
was
filled
with
the
flashing
of
the
rifles
the
cloud
of
smoke
grew
heavier
and
faces
either
from
heat
or
excitement
showed
red
through
it
the
air
was
filled
with
bullets
and
the
wyoming
force
was
being
cut
down
fast
as
the
fire
of
more
than
a
thousand
rifles
converged
upon
it
the
five
at
the
fringe
of
the
swamp
loaded
and
fired
as
fast
as
they
could
at
the
indian
horde
but
they
saw
that
it
was
creeping
closer
and
closer
and
that
the
hail
of
bullets
it
sent
in
was
cutting
away
the
whole
left
flank
of
the
defenders
they
saw
the
tall
figure
of
timmendiquas
a
very
god
of
war
leading
on
the
indians
with
his
fearless
wyandots
in
a
close
cluster
around
him
colonel
john
durkee
gathering
up
a
force
of
fifty
or
sixty
charged
straight
at
the
warriors
but
he
was
killed
by
a
withering
volley
which
drove
his
men
back
now
occurred
a
fatal
thing
one
of
those
misconceptions
which
often
decide
the
fate
of
a
battle
the
company
of
captain
whittlesey
on
the
extreme
left
which
was
suffering
most
severely
was
ordered
to
fall
back
the
entire
little
army
which
was
being
pressed
hard
now
seeing
the
movement
of
whittlesey
began
to
retreat
even
without
the
mistake
it
is
likely
they
would
have
lost
in
the
face
of
such
numbers
the
entire
horde
of
indians
tories
canadians
english
and
renegades
uttering
a
tremendous
yell
rushed
forward
colonel
zebulon
butler
seeing
the
crisis
rode
up
and
down
in
front
of
his
men
shouting
leave
me
my
children
the
victory
is
ours
bravely
his
officers
strove
to
stop
the
retreat
every
captain
who
led
a
company
into
action
was
killed
some
of
these
captains
were
but
boys
the
men
were
falling
by
dozens
all
the
indians
by
far
the
most
formidable
part
of
the
invading
force
were
through
the
swamp
now
and
dashing
down
their
unloaded
rifles
threw
themselves
tomahawk
in
hand
upon
the
defense
not
more
than
two
hundred
of
the
wyoming
men
were
left
standing
and
the
impact
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
savage
warriors
was
so
great
that
they
were
hurled
back
in
confusion
a
wail
of
grief
and
terror
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
where
a
great
body
of
women
and
children
were
watching
the
fighting
battle
lost
said
sol
hope
of
saving
it
said
henry
boys
we
five
are
alive
yet
and
we
do
our
best
to
help
the
others
protect
the
they
kept
under
cover
fighting
as
calmly
as
they
could
amid
such
a
terrible
scene
picking
off
warrior
after
warrior
saving
more
than
one
soldier
ere
the
tomahawk
fell
sol
took
a
shot
at
butler
but
he
was
too
far
away
and
the
bullet
missed
him
give
five
years
of
my
life
if
he
were
fifty
yards
nearer
exclaimed
the
shiftless
one
but
the
invading
force
came
in
between
and
he
did
not
get
another
shot
there
was
now
a
terrible
medley
a
continuous
uproar
the
crashing
fire
of
hundreds
of
rifles
the
shouts
of
the
indians
and
the
cries
of
the
wounded
over
them
all
hovered
smoke
and
dust
and
the
air
was
heavy
too
with
the
odor
of
burnt
gunpowder
the
division
of
old
men
and
very
young
boys
stood
next
and
the
indians
were
upon
them
tomahawk
in
hand
but
in
the
face
of
terrible
odds
all
bore
themselves
with
a
valor
worthy
of
the
best
of
soldiers
three
fourths
of
them
died
that
day
before
they
were
driven
back
on
the
fort
the
wyoming
force
was
pushed
away
from
the
edge
of
the
swamp
which
had
been
some
protection
to
the
left
and
they
were
now
assailed
from
all
sides
except
that
of
the
river
butler
raged
at
the
head
of
his
men
who
had
been
driven
back
at
first
and
who
had
been
saved
by
the
indians
timmendiquas
in
the
absence
of
brant
who
was
not
seen
upon
this
field
became
by
valor
and
power
of
intellect
the
leader
of
all
the
indians
for
this
moment
the
iroquois
although
their
own
fierce
chiefs
sangerachte
and
the
others
fought
with
them
unconsciously
obeyed
him
nor
did
the
fierce
woman
queen
esther
shirk
the
battle
waving
her
great
tomahawk
she
was
continually
among
the
warriors
singing
her
song
of
war
and
death
they
were
driven
steadily
back
toward
the
fort
and
the
little
band
crumbled
away
beneath
the
deadly
fire
soon
none
would
be
left
unless
they
ran
for
their
lives
the
five
drew
away
toward
the
forest
they
saw
that
the
fort
itself
could
not
hold
out
against
such
a
numerous
and
victorious
foe
and
they
had
no
mind
to
be
trapped
but
their
retreat
was
slow
and
as
they
went
they
sent
bullet
after
bullet
into
the
indian
flank
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
wyoming
force
was
left
and
it
now
broke
colonel
butler
and
colonel
dennison
who
were
mounted
reached
the
fort
some
of
the
men
jumped
into
the
river
swam
to
the
other
shore
and
escaped
some
swam
to
a
little
island
called
monocacy
and
hid
but
the
tories
and
indians
hunted
them
out
and
slew
them
one
tory
found
his
brother
there
and
killed
him
with
his
own
hand
a
deed
of
unspeakable
horror
that
is
yet
mentioned
by
the
people
of
that
region
a
few
fled
into
the
forest
and
entered
the
fort
at
night
chapter
x
the
bloody
rock
seeing
that
all
was
lost
the
five
drew
farther
away
into
the
woods
they
were
not
wounded
yet
their
faces
were
white
despite
the
tan
they
had
never
before
looked
upon
so
terrible
a
scene
the
indians
wild
with
the
excitement
of
a
great
triumph
and
thirsting
for
blood
were
running
over
the
field
scalping
the
dead
killing
some
of
the
wounded
and
saving
others
for
the
worst
of
tortures
nor
were
their
white
allies
one
whit
behind
them
they
bore
a
full
part
in
the
merciless
war
upon
the
conquered
timmendiquas
the
great
wyandot
was
the
only
one
to
show
nobility
several
of
the
wounded
he
saved
from
immediate
death
and
he
tried
to
hold
back
the
frenzied
swarm
of
old
squaws
who
rushed
forward
and
began
to
practice
cruelties
at
which
even
the
most
veteran
warrior
might
shudder
but
queen
esther
urged
them
on
and
butler
himself
and
the
chiefs
were
afraid
of
her
henry
despite
himself
despite
all
his
experience
and
powers
of
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
at
the
cries
that
came
from
the
lost
field
and
he
was
sure
that
the
others
were
doing
the
same
the
sun
was
setting
but
its
dying
light
brilliant
and
intense
tinged
the
field
as
if
with
blood
showing
all
the
yelling
horde
as
the
warriors
rushed
about
for
scalps
or
danced
in
triumph
whirling
their
hideous
trophies
about
their
heads
others
were
firing
at
men
who
were
escaping
to
the
far
bank
of
the
susquehanna
and
others
were
already
seeking
the
fugitives
in
their
vain
hiding
places
on
the
little
islet
the
five
moved
farther
into
the
forest
retreating
slowly
and
sending
in
a
shot
now
and
then
to
protect
the
retreat
of
some
fugitive
who
was
seeking
the
shelter
of
the
woods
the
retreat
had
become
a
rout
and
then
a
massacre
the
savages
raged
up
and
down
in
the
greatest
killing
they
had
known
since
braddock
defeat
the
lodges
of
the
iroquois
would
be
full
of
the
scalps
of
white
men
all
the
five
felt
the
full
horror
of
the
scene
but
it
made
its
deepest
impress
perhaps
upon
paul
he
had
taken
part
in
border
battles
before
but
this
was
the
first
great
defeat
he
was
not
blind
to
the
valor
and
good
qualities
of
the
indian
and
his
claim
upon
the
wilderness
but
he
saw
the
incredible
cruelties
that
he
could
commit
and
he
felt
a
horror
of
those
who
used
him
as
an
ally
a
horror
that
he
could
never
dismiss
from
his
mind
as
long
as
he
lived
he
exclaimed
at
that
a
man
of
seventy
and
a
boy
of
fourteen
were
running
for
the
forest
they
might
have
been
grandfather
and
grandson
undoubtedly
they
had
fought
in
the
battalion
of
the
very
old
and
the
very
young
and
now
when
everything
else
was
lost
they
were
seeking
to
save
their
lives
in
the
friendly
shelter
of
the
woods
but
they
were
pursued
by
two
groups
of
iroquois
four
warriors
in
one
and
three
in
the
other
and
the
indians
were
gaining
fast
reckon
we
ought
to
save
them
said
sol
doubt
of
it
said
henry
you
and
sol
move
off
to
the
right
a
little
and
take
the
three
while
the
rest
of
us
will
look
out
for
the
the
little
band
separated
according
to
the
directions
paul
and
sol
having
the
lighter
task
as
the
others
were
to
meet
the
group
of
four
indians
at
closer
range
paul
and
sol
were
behind
some
trees
and
turning
at
an
angle
they
ran
forward
to
intercept
the
three
indians
it
would
have
seemed
to
anyone
who
was
not
aware
of
the
presence
of
friends
in
the
forest
that
the
old
man
and
the
boy
would
surely
be
overtaken
and
be
tomahawked
but
three
rifles
suddenly
flashed
among
the
foliage
two
of
the
warriors
in
the
group
of
four
fell
and
a
third
uttered
a
yell
of
pain
paul
and
sol
fired
at
the
same
time
at
the
group
of
three
one
fell
before
the
deadly
rifle
of
sol
but
paul
only
grazed
his
man
nevertheless
the
whole
pursuit
stopped
and
the
boy
and
the
old
man
escaped
to
the
forest
and
subsequently
to
safety
at
the
moravian
towns
paul
watching
the
happy
effect
of
the
shots
was
about
to
say
something
to
sol
when
an
immense
force
was
hurled
upon
him
and
he
was
thrown
to
the
ground
his
comrade
was
served
in
the
same
way
but
the
shiftless
one
was
uncommonly
strong
and
agile
he
managed
to
writhe
half
way
to
his
knees
and
he
shouted
in
a
tremendous
voice
henry
run
you
ca
do
anything
for
us
now
braxton
wyatt
struck
him
fiercely
across
the
mouth
the
blood
came
but
the
shiftless
one
merely
spat
it
out
and
looked
curiously
at
the
renegade
often
wondered
about
you
braxton
he
said
calmly
used
to
think
that
anybody
no
matter
how
bad
had
some
good
in
him
but
i
reckon
you
ai
got
wyatt
did
not
answer
but
rushed
forward
in
search
of
the
others
but
henry
silent
tom
and
long
jim
had
vanished
a
powerful
party
of
warriors
had
stolen
upon
sol
and
paul
while
they
were
absorbed
in
the
chase
of
the
old
man
and
the
boy
and
now
they
were
prisoners
bound
securely
braxton
wyatt
came
back
from
the
fruitless
search
for
the
three
but
his
face
was
full
of
savage
joy
as
he
looked
down
at
the
captured
two
could
have
killed
you
just
as
easily
he
said
we
want
to
do
that
our
friends
here
are
going
to
have
their
fun
with
you
paul
cheeks
whitened
a
little
at
the
horrible
suggestion
but
sol
faced
them
boldly
several
white
men
in
uniform
had
come
up
and
among
them
was
an
elderly
one
short
and
squat
and
with
a
great
flame
colored
handkerchief
tied
around
his
bead
may
burn
us
alive
or
you
may
do
other
things
jest
ez
bad
to
us
all
under
the
english
flag
said
sol
i
thinkin
that
a
lot
o
people
in
england
will
be
ashamed
uv
it
when
they
hear
the
butler
and
his
uniformed
soldiers
turned
away
leaving
sol
and
paul
in
the
hands
of
the
renegade
and
the
iroquois
the
two
prisoners
were
jerked
to
their
feet
and
told
to
march
on
paul
said
sol
wuth
while
fur
us
to
resist
but
do
you
quit
hopin
paul
we
escaped
from
many
a
tight
corner
an
mebbe

said
braxton
wyatt
savagely
you

another
word
gag
you
in
a
way
that
will
make
you
sol
looked
him
squarely
in
the
eye
solomon
hyde
who
was
not
shiftless
at
all
had
a
dauntless
soul
and
he
was
not
afraid
now
in
the
face
of
death
preceded
by
long
torture
had
a
dog
once
braxton
wyatt
he
said
i
reckon
he
wuz
the
meanest
ornierest
cur
that
ever
lived
he
liked
to
live
on
dirt
the
dirtier
the
place
he
could
find
the
better
he
rather
steal
his
food
than
get
it
honestly
he
wuz
sech
a
coward
that
he
wuz
afeard
o
a
rabbit
but
ef
your
back
wuz
turned
to
him
he
nip
you
in
the
ankle
but
bad
ez
that
dog
wuz
braxton
he
wuz
a
gentleman
o
some
of
the
indians
understood
english
and
wyatt
knew
it
he
snatched
a
pistol
from
his
belt
and
was
about
to
strike
sol
with
the
butt
of
it
but
a
tall
figure
suddenly
appeared
before
him
and
made
a
commanding
gesture
the
gesture
said
plainly
not
strike
put
that
pistol
back
braxton
wyatt
whose
soul
was
afraid
within
him
did
not
strike
and
he
put
the
pistol
back
it
was
timmendiquas
the
great
white
lightning
of
the
wyandots
who
with
his
little
detachment
had
proved
that
day
how
mighty
the
wyandot
warriors
were
full
equals
of
thayendanegea
mohawks
the
keepers
of
the
western
gate
he
was
bare
to
the
waist
one
shoulder
was
streaked
with
blood
from
a
slight
wound
but
his
countenance
was
not
on
fire
with
passion
for
torture
and
slaughter
like
those
of
the
others
is
no
need
to
strike
prisoners
he
said
in
english
fate
will
be
decided
paul
thought
that
he
caught
a
look
of
pity
from
the
eyes
of
the
great
wyandot
and
sol
said
sorry
timmendiquas
since
i
had
to
be
captured
that
you
capture
me
yourself
i
glad
to
say
that
you
a
great
wyatt
growled
under
his
breath
but
he
was
still
afraid
to
speak
out
although
he
knew
that
timmendiquas
was
merely
a
distant
and
casual
ally
and
had
little
authority
in
that
army
yet
he
was
overawed
and
so
were
the
indians
with
him
were
merely
taking
the
prisoners
to
colonel
butler
he
said
is
timmendiquas
stared
at
him
and
the
renegade
face
fell
but
he
and
the
indians
went
on
with
the
prisoners
and
timmendiquas
looked
after
them
until
they
were
out
of
sight
believe
white
lightning
was
sorry
that
we
been
captured
whispered
sol
think
so
too
paul
whispered
back
they
had
no
chance
for
further
conversation
as
they
were
driven
rapidly
now
to
that
point
of
the
battlefield
which
lay
nearest
to
the
fort
and
here
they
were
thrust
into
the
midst
of
a
gloomy
company
fellow
captives
all
bound
tightly
and
many
wounded
no
help
no
treatment
of
any
kind
was
offered
for
hurts
the
indians
and
renegades
stood
about
and
yelled
with
delight
when
the
agony
of
some
man
wound
wrung
from
him
a
groan
the
scene
was
hideous
in
every
respect
the
setting
sun
shone
blood
red
over
forest
field
and
river
far
off
burning
houses
still
smoked
like
torches
but
the
mountain
wall
in
the
east
was
growing
dusky
with
the
coming
twilight
from
the
island
where
they
were
massacring
the
fugitives
in
their
vain
hiding
places
came
the
sound
of
shots
and
cries
but
elsewhere
the
firing
had
ceased
all
who
could
escape
had
done
so
already
and
of
the
others
those
who
were
dead
were
fortunate
the
sun
sank
like
a
red
ball
behind
the
mountains
and
darkness
swept
down
over
the
earth
fires
began
to
blaze
up
here
and
there
some
for
terrible
purpose
the
victorious
iroquois
stripped
to
the
waist
and
painted
in
glaring
colors
joined
in
a
savage
dance
that
would
remain
forever
photographed
on
the
eye
of
paul
cotter
as
they
jumped
to
and
fro
hundreds
of
them
waving
aloft
tomahawks
and
scalping
knives
both
of
which
dripped
red
they
sang
their
wild
chant
of
war
and
triumph
white
men
too
as
savage
as
they
joined
them
paul
shuddered
again
and
again
from
head
to
foot
at
this
sight
of
an
orgy
such
as
the
mass
of
mankind
escapes
even
in
dreams
the
darkness
thickened
the
dance
grew
wilder
it
was
like
a
carnival
of
demons
but
it
was
to
be
incited
to
a
yet
wilder
pitch
a
singular
figure
one
of
extraordinary
ferocity
was
suddenly
projected
into
the
midst
of
the
whirling
crowd
and
a
chant
shriller
and
fiercer
rose
above
all
the
others
the
figure
was
that
of
queen
esther
like
some
monstrous
creature
out
of
a
dim
past
her
great
tomahawk
stained
with
blood
her
eyes
bloodshot
and
stains
upon
her
shoulders
paul
would
have
covered
his
eyes
had
his
hands
not
been
tied
instead
he
turned
his
head
away
he
could
not
bear
to
see
more
but
the
horrible
chant
came
to
his
ears
nevertheless
and
it
was
reinforced
presently
by
other
sounds
still
more
terrible
fires
sprang
up
in
the
forest
and
cries
came
from
these
fires
the
victorious
army
of
butler
was
beginning
to
burn
the
prisoners
alive
but
at
this
point
we
must
stop
the
details
of
what
happened
around
those
fires
that
night
are
not
for
the
ordinary
reader
it
suffices
to
say
that
the
darkest
deed
ever
done
on
the
soil
of
what
is
now
the
united
states
was
being
enacted
sol
himself
iron
of
body
and
soul
was
shaken
he
could
not
close
his
ears
if
he
would
to
the
cries
that
came
from
the
fires
but
he
shut
his
eyes
to
keep
out
the
demon
dance
nevertheless
he
opened
them
again
in
a
moment
the
horrible
fascination
was
too
great
he
saw
queen
esther
still
shaking
her
tomahawk
but
as
he
looked
she
suddenly
darted
through
the
circle
warriors
willingly
giving
way
before
her
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
the
scalp
dance
went
on
but
it
had
lost
some
of
its
fire
and
vigor
sol
felt
relieved
gone
he
whispered
to
paul
and
the
boy
too
then
opened
his
eyes
the
rest
of
it
the
mad
whirlings
and
jumpings
of
the
warriors
was
becoming
a
blur
before
him
confused
and
without
meaning
neither
he
nor
sol
knew
how
long
they
had
been
sitting
there
on
the
ground
although
it
had
grown
yet
darker
when
braxton
wyatt
thrust
a
violent
foot
against
the
shiftless
one
and
cried
up
you
wanted
a
half
dozen
seneca
warriors
were
with
him
and
there
was
no
chance
of
resistance
the
two
rose
slowly
to
their
feet
and
walked
where
braxton
wyatt
led
the
senecas
came
on
either
side
and
close
behind
them
tomahawks
in
their
hands
paul
the
sensitive
who
so
often
felt
the
impression
of
coming
events
from
the
conditions
around
him
was
sure
that
they
were
marching
to
their
fate
death
he
did
not
fear
so
greatly
although
he
did
not
want
to
die
but
when
a
shriek
came
to
him
from
one
of
the
fires
that
convulsive
shudder
shook
him
again
from
head
to
foot
unconsciously
he
strained
at
his
bound
arms
not
for
freedom
but
that
he
might
thrust
his
fingers
in
his
ears
and
shut
out
the
awful
sounds
sol
because
he
could
not
use
his
hands
touched
his
shoulder
gently
against
paul
he
whispered
ai
sure
that
we
goin
to
die
leastways
i
still
have
hope
but
ef
we
do
remember
that
we
do
have
to
die
but
remember
sol
paul
whispered
back
there
exclaimed
braxton
wyatt
but
the
two
had
said
all
they
wanted
to
say
and
fortunately
their
senses
were
somewhat
dulled
they
had
passed
through
so
much
that
they
were
like
those
who
are
under
the
influence
of
opiates
the
path
was
now
dark
although
both
torches
and
fires
burned
in
the
distance
presently
they
heard
that
chant
with
which
they
had
become
familiar
the
dreadful
notes
of
the
hyena
woman
and
they
knew
that
they
were
being
taken
into
her
presence
for
what
purpose
they
could
not
tell
although
they
were
sure
that
it
was
a
bitter
one
as
they
approached
the
woman
chant
rose
to
an
uncommon
pitch
of
frenzy
and
paul
felt
the
blood
slowly
chilling
within
him
up
there
exclaimed
braxton
wyatt
and
the
senecas
gave
them
both
a
push
other
warriors
who
were
standing
at
the
edge
of
an
open
space
seized
them
and
threw
them
forward
with
much
violence
when
they
struggled
into
a
sitting
position
they
saw
queen
esther
standing
upon
a
broad
flat
rock
and
whirling
in
a
ghastly
dance
that
had
in
it
something
oriental
she
still
swung
the
great
war
hatchet
that
seemed
always
to
be
in
her
hand
her
long
black
hair
flew
wildly
about
her
head
and
her
red
dress
gleamed
in
the
dusk
surely
no
more
terrible
image
ever
appeared
in
the
american
wilderness
in
front
of
her
lying
upon
the
ground
were
twenty
bound
americans
and
back
of
them
were
iroquois
in
dozens
with
a
sprinkling
of
their
white
allies
what
it
all
meant
what
was
about
to
come
to
pass
nether
paul
nor
sol
could
guess
but
queen
esther
sang
we
have
found
them
the
yengees
who
built
their
houses
in
the
valley
they
came
forth
to
meet
us
in
battle
our
rifles
and
tomahawks
cut
them
down
as
the
yengees
lay
low
the
forest
victory
and
glory
aieroski

to
his
children
the
mighty

greatest

there
will
be
feasting
in
the
lodges
of
the
iroquois
and
scalps
will
hang
on
the
high
ridge
pole
but
wolves
will
roam
where
the
yengees
dwelt
and
will
gnaw
the
bones
of
them
all
of
the

the
woman
and
the
child
victory
and
glory
aieroski
gives
to
his
children
the
mighty
six
nations
greatest
of
men
such
it
sounded
to
sol
who
knew
the
tongue
of
the
iroquois
and
so
it
went
on
verse
after
verse
and
at
the
end
of
each
verse
came
the
refrain
in
which
the
warriors
joined
and
glory
aieroski
gives
to
his
children
the
mighty
six
nations
greatest
of
under
the
sun
is
she
about
whispered
sol
is
a
fearful
face
was
paul
only
reply
suddenly
the
woman
without
stopping
her
chant
made
a
gesture
to
the
warriors
two
powerful
senecas
seized
one
of
the
bound
prisoners
dragged
him
to
his
feet
and
held
him
up
before
her
she
uttered
a
shout
whirled
the
great
tomahawk
about
her
head
its
blade
glittering
in
the
moonlight
and
struck
with
all
her
might
the
skull
of
the
prisoner
was
cleft
to
the
chin
and
without
a
cry
he
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
woman
who
had
killed
him
paul
uttered
a
shout
of
horror
but
it
was
lost
in
the
joyful
yells
of
the
iroquois
who
at
the
command
of
the
woman
offered
a
second
victim
again
the
tomahawk
descended
and
again
a
man
fell
dead
without
a
sound
sol
and
paul
wrenched
at
their
thongs
but
they
could
not
move
them
braxton
wyatt
laughed
aloud
it
was
strange
to
see
how
fast
one
with
a
bad
nature
could
fall
when
the
opportunities
were
spread
before
him
now
he
was
as
cruel
as
the
indians
themselves
wilder
and
shriller
grew
the
chant
of
the
savage
queen
she
was
intoxicated
with
blood
she
saw
it
everywhere
her
tomahawk
clove
a
third
skull
a
fourth
a
fifth
a
sixth
a
seventh
and
eighth
as
fast
as
they
fell
the
warriors
at
her
command
brought
up
new
victims
for
her
weapon
paul
shut
his
eyes
but
he
knew
by
the
sounds
what
was
passing
suddenly
a
stern
voice
cried
woman
enough
of
this
will
your
tomahawk
never
be
satisfied
paul
understood
it
the
meaning
but
not
the
words
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
great
figure
of
timmendiquas
striding
forward
his
hand
upraised
in
protest
the
woman
turned
her
fierce
gaze
upon
the
young
chief
she
said
are
the
iroquois
and
we
are
the
masters
you
are
far
from
your
own
land
a
guest
in
our
lodges
and
you
can
not
tell
those
who
have
won
the
victory
how
they
shall
use
it
stand
back
a
loud
laugh
came
from
the
iroquois
the
fierce
old
chiefs
hiokatoo
and
sangerachte
and
a
dozen
warriors
thrust
themselves
before
timmendiquas
the
woman
resumed
her
chant
and
a
hundred
throats
pealed
out
with
her
the
chorus
victory
and
glory
aieroski
gives
to
his
children
the
mighty
six
nations
greatest
of
men
she
gave
the
signal
anew
the
ninth
victim
stood
before
her
and
then
fell
cloven
to
the
chin
then
the
tenth
and
the
eleventh
and
the
twelfth
and
the
thirteenth
and
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
and
the
bound
men
killed
by
one
woman
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
the
four
in
that
group
who
were
left
had
all
the
while
been
straining
fearfully
at
their
bonds
now
they
had
slipped
or
broken
them
and
springing
to
their
feet
driven
on
by
the
mightiest
of
human
impulses
they
dashed
through
the
ring
of
iroquois
and
into
the
forest
two
were
hunted
down
by
the
warriors
and
killed
but
the
other
two
joseph
elliott
and
lebbeus
hammond
escaped
and
lived
to
be
old
men
feeling
that
life
could
never
again
hold
for
them
anything
so
dreadful
as
that
scene
at
bloody
a
great
turmoil
and
confusion
arose
as
the
prisoners
fled
and
the
indians
pursued
paul
and
sol
full
of
sympathy
and
pity
for
the
fugitives
and
having
felt
all
the
time
that
their
turn
too
would
come
under
that
dreadful
tomahawk
struggled
to
their
feet
they
did
not
see
a
form
slip
noiselessly
behind
them
but
a
sharp
knife
descended
once
then
twice
and
the
bands
of
both
fell
free
run
exclaimed
the
voice
of
timmendiquas
low
but
penetrating
would
save
you
from
this
amid
the
darkness
and
confusion
the
act
of
the
great
wyandot
was
not
seen
by
the
other
indians
and
the
renegades
paul
flashed
him
one
look
of
gratitude
and
then
he
and
sol
darted
away
choosing
a
course
that
led
them
from
the
crowd
in
pursuit
of
the
other
flying
fugitives
at
such
a
time
they
might
have
secured
a
long
lead
without
being
noticed
had
it
not
been
for
the
fierce
swarm
of
old
squaws
who
were
first
in
cruelty
that
night
a
shrill
wild
howl
arose
and
the
pointing
fingers
of
the
old
women
showed
to
the
warriors
the
two
in
flight
at
the
same
time
several
of
the
squaws
darted
forward
to
intercept
the
fugitives
hate
to
hit
a
woman
breathed
sol
to
paul
i
to
do
it
a
hideous
figure
sprang
before
them
sol
struck
her
face
with
his
open
hand
and
with
a
shriek
she
went
down
he
leaped
over
her
although
she
clawed
at
his
feet
as
he
passed
and
ran
on
with
paul
at
his
side
shots
were
now
fired
at
him
but
they
went
wild
but
paul
casting
a
look
backward
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
saw
that
a
real
pursuit
silent
and
deadly
had
begun
five
mohawk
warriors
running
swiftly
were
only
a
few
hundred
yards
away
they
carried
rifle
tomahawk
and
knife
and
paul
and
sol
were
unarmed
moreover
they
were
coming
fast
spreading
out
slightly
and
the
shiftless
one
able
even
at
such
a
time
to
weigh
the
case
coolly
saw
that
the
odds
were
against
them
yet
he
would
not
despair
anything
might
happen
it
was
night
there
was
little
organization
in
the
army
of
the
indians
and
of
their
white
allies
which
was
giving
itself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
scalps
and
torture
moreover
he
and
paul
were
animated
by
the
love
of
life
which
is
always
stronger
than
the
desire
to
give
death
their
flight
led
them
in
a
diagonal
line
toward
the
mountains
only
once
did
the
pursuers
give
tongue
paul
tripped
over
a
root
and
a
triumphant
yell
came
from
the
mohawks
but
it
merely
gave
him
new
life
he
recovered
himself
in
an
instant
and
ran
faster
but
it
was
terribly
hard
work
he
could
hear
sol
sobbing
breath
by
his
side
and
he
was
sure
that
his
own
must
have
the
same
sound
for
his
comrade
any
rate
one
uv
is
beat
gasped
sol
four
are
on
the
ground
rose
a
little
and
became
rougher
the
lights
from
the
indian
fires
had
sunk
almost
out
of
sight
behind
them
and
a
dense
thicket
lay
before
them
something
stirred
in
the
thicket
and
the
eyes
of
sol
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
human
shoulder
his
heart
sank
like
a
plummet
in
a
pool
the
indians
were
ahead
of
them
they
would
be
caught
and
would
be
carried
back
to
become
the
victims
of
the
terrible
tomahawk
the
figure
in
the
bushes
rose
a
little
higher
the
muzzle
of
a
rifle
was
projected
and
flame
leaped
from
the
steel
tube
but
it
was
neither
sol
nor
paul
who
fell
they
heard
a
cry
behind
them
and
when
sol
took
a
hasty
glance
backward
he
saw
one
of
the
mohawks
fall
the
three
who
were
left
hesitated
and
stopped
when
a
second
shot
was
fired
from
the
bushes
and
another
mohawk
went
down
the
remaining
two
fled
sol
understood
now
and
he
rushed
into
the
bushes
dragging
paul
after
him
henry
tom
and
long
jim
rose
up
to
receive
them
you
wuz
watchin
over
us
exclaimed
the
shiftless
one
joyously
wuz
you
that
clipped
off
the
first
mohawk
an
we
did
even
notice
the
god
you
were
here
exclaimed
paul
do
know
what
sol
and
i
have
seen
overwrought
he
fell
forward
but
his
comrades
caught
him
chapter
xi
the
melancholy
flight
paul
revived
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
still
lying
in
the
bushes
and
when
he
was
able
to
stand
up
again
they
moved
at
an
angle
several
hundred
yards
before
they
stopped
one
pistol
was
thrust
into
hand
and
another
into
that
of
sol
those
until
we
can
get
rifles
for
you
said
henry
may
need
they
crouched
down
in
the
thicket
and
looked
back
toward
the
indian
camp
the
warriors
whom
they
had
repulsed
were
not
returning
with
help
and
for
the
moment
they
seemed
to
have
no
enemy
to
fear
yet
they
could
still
see
through
the
woods
the
faint
lights
of
the
indian
camps
and
to
paul
at
least
came
the
echoes
of
distant
cries
that
told
of
things
not
to
be
written
saw
you
captured
and
we
heard
sol
warning
cry
said
henry
was
nothing
to
do
but
run
then
we
hid
and
waited
a
chance
for
would
never
have
come
if
it
had
not
been
for
timmendiquas
said
paul
exclaimed
henry
timmendiquas
said
paul
and
then
he
told
the
story
of
bloody
rock
and
how
in
the
turmoil
and
excitement
attending
the
flight
of
the
last
four
timmendiquas
had
cut
the
bonds
of
sol
and
himself
think
the
mind
o
white
lightnin
injun
ez
he
is
said
sol
naterally
turned
aginst
so
much
slaughter
an
torture
sure
you
right
said
henry
strange
to
me
said
long
jim
hart
timmendiquas
was
made
an
injun
he
jest
the
kind
uv
man
who
ought
to
be
white
an
he
be
useful
too
i
do
jest
eggzactly
understan
has
certainly
saved
the
lives
of
at
least
three
of
us
said
henry
hope
we
will
get
a
chance
to
pay
him
back
in
he
the
only
one
said
sol
thinking
of
all
that
he
had
seen
that
night
iroquois
an
the
white
men
that
allied
with
wo
ever
get
any
mercy
from
me
ef
any
uv
happen
to
come
under
my
thumb
i
do
think
the
like
o
this
day
an
night
wuz
ever
done
on
this
continent
afore
i
for
revenge
i
am
like
that
place
where
the
bible
says
eye
for
an
eye
an
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
an
i
to
stay
in
this
part
o
the
country
till
we
git
it
it
was
seldom
that
sol
spoke
with
so
much
passion
and
energy
all
going
to
stay
with
you
sol
said
henry
needed
here
i
think
we
ought
to
circle
about
the
fort
slip
in
if
we
can
and
fight
with
the
we
do
that
said
sol
the
wyoming
fort
ever
hold
out
thar
ai
a
hundred
men
left
in
it
fit
to
fight
thar
are
more
than
than
a
thousand
howlin
devils
outside
ready
to
attack
it
thar
may
be
worse
to
come
than
anything
we
yet
we
go
in
an
help
said
henry
when
you
an
paul
have
rested
a
little
longer
we
make
a
big
loop
around
in
the
woods
and
come
up
to
the
fort
on
the
other
they
were
in
full
accord
and
after
an
hour
in
the
bushes
where
they
lay
completely
hidden
recovering
their
vitality
and
energy
they
undertook
to
reach
the
fort
and
cabins
inclosed
by
the
palisades
paul
was
still
weak
from
shock
but
sol
had
fully
recovered
neither
bad
weapons
but
they
were
sure
that
the
want
could
be
supplied
soon
they
curved
around
toward
the
west
intending
to
approach
the
fort
from
the
other
side
but
they
did
not
wholly
lose
sight
of
the
fires
and
they
heard
now
and
then
the
triumphant
war
whoop
the
victors
were
still
engaged
in
the
pleasant
task
of
burning
the
prisoners
to
death
little
did
the
five
seeing
and
feeling
only
their
part
of
it
there
in
the
dark
woods
dream
that
the
deeds
of
this
day
and
night
would
soon
shock
the
whole
civilized
world
and
remain
for
generations
a
crowning
act
of
infamy
but
they
certainly
felt
it
deeply
enough
and
in
each
heart
burned
a
fierce
desire
for
revenge
upon
the
iroquois
it
was
almost
midnight
when
they
secured
entrance
into
the
fort
which
was
filled
with
grief
and
wailing
that
afternoon
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
women
within
those
walls
had
been
made
widows
and
six
hundred
children
had
been
made
orphans
but
few
men
fit
to
bear
arms
were
left
for
its
defense
and
it
was
certain
that
the
allied
british
and
indian
army
would
easily
take
it
on
the
morrow
a
demand
for
its
surrender
in
the
name
of
king
george
iii
of
england
had
already
been
made
and
sitting
at
a
little
rough
table
in
the
cabin
of
thomas
bennett
the
room
lighted
only
by
a
single
tallow
wick
colonel
butler
and
colonel
dennison
were
writing
an
agreement
that
the
fort
be
surrendered
the
next
day
with
what
it
should
contain
but
colonel
butler
put
his
wife
on
a
horse
and
escaped
with
her
over
the
mountains
stragglers
evading
the
tomahawk
in
the
darkness
were
coming
in
only
to
be
surrendered
the
next
day
others
were
pouring
forth
in
a
stream
seeking
the
shelter
of
the
mountains
and
the
forest
preferring
any
dangers
that
might
be
found
there
to
the
mercies
of
the
victors
when
sol
learned
that
the
fort
was
to
be
given
up
he
said
looks
ez
ef
we
had
escaped
from
the
iroquois
jest
in
time
to
beg
to
take
us
reckon
i
ai
goin
to
stay
here
while
things
are
surrendered
said
long
jim
hart
do
my
surrenderin
to
iroquois
when
they
got
my
hands
an
feet
tied
an
six
or
seven
uv
are
settin
on
my
back
said
tom
ross
leave
as
soon
as
we
can
get
arms
for
sol
and
paul
said
henry
course
it
would
be
foolish
of
us
to
stay
here
and
be
captured
again
besides
we
be
needed
badly
enough
by
the
women
and
children
that
are
good
weapons
were
easily
obtained
in
the
fort
it
was
far
better
to
let
sol
and
paul
have
them
than
to
leave
them
for
the
indians
they
were
able
to
select
two
fine
rifles
of
the
kentucky
pattern
long
and
slender
barreled
a
tomahawk
and
knife
for
each
and
also
excellent
pistols
the
other
three
now
had
pistols
too
in
addition
they
resupplied
themselves
with
as
much
ammunition
as
scouts
and
hunters
could
conveniently
carry
and
toward
morning
left
the
fort
sunrise
found
them
some
distance
from
the
palisades
and
upon
the
flank
of
a
frightened
crowd
of
fugitives
it
was
composed
of
one
hundred
women
and
children
and
a
single
man
james
carpenter
who
was
doing
his
best
to
guide
and
protect
them
they
were
intending
to
flee
through
the
wilderness
to
the
delaware
and
lehigh
settlements
chiefly
fort
penn
built
by
jacob
stroud
where
stroudsburg
now
is
when
the
five
darkened
by
weather
and
looking
almost
like
indians
themselves
approached
carpenter
stepped
forward
and
raised
his
rifle
a
cry
of
dismay
rose
from
the
melancholy
line
a
cry
so
intensely
bitter
that
it
cut
henry
to
the
very
heart
he
threw
up
his
hand
and
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
are
friends
not
indians
or
tories
we
fought
with
you
yesterday
and
we
are
ready
to
fight
for
you
now
carpenter
dropped
the
muzzle
of
the
rifle
he
had
fought
in
the
battle
too
and
he
recognized
the
great
youth
and
his
comrades
who
had
been
there
with
him
do
you
want
of
us
asked
he
replied
henry
to
help
carpenter
looked
at
them
with
a
kind
of
sad
pathos
do
belong
here
in
wyoming
he
said
there
nothing
to
make
you
stick
to
us
what
are
you
meaning
to
do
will
go
with
you
wherever
you
intend
to
go
replied
henry
fighting
for
you
if
you
need
it
and
hunt
game
for
you
which
you
are
certain
to
the
face
of
the
farmer
worked
thought
god
had
clean
deserted
us
he
said
i
ready
to
take
it
back
i
reckon
that
he
has
sent
you
five
to
help
me
with
all
these
women
and
little
it
occurred
to
henry
that
perhaps
god
indeed
had
sent
them
for
this
very
purpose
but
he
replied
simply
lead
on
and
we
stay
in
the
rear
and
on
the
sides
to
watch
for
the
indians
draw
into
the
woods
where
we
be
carpenter
obscure
hero
shouldered
his
rifle
again
and
led
on
toward
the
woods
the
long
line
of
women
and
children
followed
some
of
the
women
carried
in
their
arms
children
too
small
to
walk
yet
they
were
more
hopeful
now
when
they
saw
that
the
five
were
friends
these
lithe
active
frontiersmen
so
quick
so
skillful
and
so
helpful
raised
their
courage
yet
it
was
a
most
doleful
flight
most
of
these
women
had
been
made
widows
the
day
before
some
of
them
had
been
made
widows
and
childless
at
the
same
time
and
wondered
why
they
should
seek
to
live
longer
but
the
very
mental
stupor
of
many
of
them
was
an
aid
they
ceased
to
cry
out
and
some
even
ceased
to
be
afraid
henry
sol
and
tom
dropped
to
the
rear
paul
and
long
jim
were
on
either
flank
while
carpenter
led
slowly
on
toward
the
mountains
to
me
said
tom
the
thing
fur
us
to
do
is
to
hurry
up
ez
much
ez
the
indians
wo
see
crossing
the
plain
said
henry
could
defend
them
against
a
large
force
and
it
would
merely
be
a
massacre
we
must
persuade
them
to
walk
sol
was
invaluable
in
this
crisis
he
could
talk
forever
in
way
and
with
his
gentle
encouragement
mild
sarcasm
and
anecdotes
of
great
feminine
walkers
that
he
had
known
he
soon
had
them
moving
faster
henry
and
tom
dropped
farther
to
the
rear
they
could
see
ahead
of
them
the
long
dark
line
coiling
farther
into
the
woods
but
they
could
also
see
to
right
and
left
towers
of
smoke
rising
in
the
clear
morning
sunlight
these
they
knew
came
from
burning
houses
and
they
knew
also
that
the
valley
would
be
ravaged
from
end
to
end
and
from
side
to
side
after
the
surrender
of
the
fort
the
indians
would
divide
into
small
bands
going
everywhere
and
nothing
could
escape
them
the
sun
rose
higher
gilding
the
earth
with
glowing
light
as
if
the
black
tragedy
had
never
happened
but
the
frontiersmen
recognized
their
greatest
danger
in
this
brilliant
morning
objects
could
be
seen
at
a
great
distance
and
they
could
be
seen
vividly
keen
of
sight
and
trained
to
know
what
it
was
they
saw
henry
sol
and
tom
searched
the
country
with
their
eyes
on
all
sides
they
caught
a
distant
glimpse
of
the
susquehanna
a
silver
spot
among
some
trees
and
they
saw
the
sunlight
glancing
off
the
opposite
mountains
but
for
the
present
they
saw
nothing
that
seemed
hostile
they
allowed
the
distance
between
them
and
the
retreating
file
to
grow
until
it
was
five
or
six
hundred
yards
and
they
might
have
let
it
grow
farther
but
henry
made
a
signal
and
the
three
lay
down
in
the
grass
see
do
you
the
youth
whispered
to
his
comrade
down
thar
at
the
foot
o
that
hillock
replied
sol
o
em
an
senecas
i
take
seen
that
crowd
of
women
and
children
said
henry
it
was
obvious
that
the
flying
column
was
discovered
the
two
indians
stepped
upon
the
hillock
and
gazed
under
their
hands
it
was
too
far
away
for
the
three
to
see
their
faces
but
they
knew
the
joy
that
would
be
shown
there
the
two
could
return
with
a
few
warriors
and
massacre
them
all
must
never
get
back
to
the
other
indians
with
their
news
whispered
henry
hate
to
shoot
men
from
ambush
but
it
got
to
be
done
wait
they
coming
a
little
the
two
senecas
advanced
about
thirty
yards
and
stopped
again
you
fire
at
the
one
on
the
right
henry
said
tom
me
sol
will
take
the
one
to
the
right
said
henry
they
wasted
no
time
but
pulled
trigger
the
one
at
whom
henry
had
aimed
fell
but
the
other
uttering
a
cry
made
off
wounded
but
evidently
with
plenty
of
strength
left
must
let
him
escape
we
must
let
him
carry
a
warning
cried
henry
but
sol
and
tom
ross
were
already
in
pursuit
covering
the
ground
with
long
strides
and
reloading
as
they
ran
under
ordinary
circumstances
no
one
of
the
three
would
have
fired
at
a
man
running
for
his
life
but
here
the
necessity
was
vital
if
he
lived
carrying
the
tale
that
he
had
to
tell
a
hundred
innocent
ones
might
perish
henry
followed
his
comrades
reloading
his
own
rifle
also
but
he
stayed
behind
the
indian
had
a
good
lead
and
he
was
gaining
as
the
others
were
compelled
to
check
speed
somewhat
as
they
put
the
powder
and
bullets
in
their
rifles
but
henry
was
near
enough
to
sol
and
silent
tom
to
hear
them
exchange
a
few
words
far
away
is
that
savage
asked
sol
and
eighty
yards
said
tom
ross
you
take
him
in
the
head
and
i
take
him
in
the
henry
saw
the
two
rifle
barrels
go
up
and
two
flashes
of
flame
leap
from
the
muzzles
the
indian
fell
forward
and
lay
still
they
went
up
to
him
and
found
that
he
was
shot
through
the
head
and
also
through
the
body
may
miss
once
but
we
do
twice
said
tom
ross
the
human
mind
can
be
influenced
so
powerfully
by
events
that
the
three
felt
no
compunction
at
all
at
the
shooting
of
this
fleeing
indian
it
was
but
a
trifle
compared
with
what
they
had
seen
the
day
and
night
before
better
take
the
weapons
an
ammunition
o
both
uv
said
sol
may
be
needed
an
some
o
the
women
in
that
crowd
kin
they
gathered
up
the
arms
powder
and
ball
and
waited
a
little
to
see
whether
the
shots
had
been
heard
by
any
other
indians
but
there
was
no
indication
of
the
presence
of
more
warriors
and
the
rejoined
the
fugitives
long
jim
had
dropped
back
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
when
he
saw
that
his
comrades
carried
two
extra
rifles
he
understood
did
give
no
alarm
did
they
he
asked
in
a
tone
so
low
that
none
of
the
fugitives
could
hear
did
have
any
chance
replied
henry
brought
away
all
their
weapons
and
ammunition
but
just
say
to
the
women
that
we
found
them
in
an
abandoned
the
rifles
and
the
other
arms
were
given
to
the
boldest
and
most
stalwart
of
the
women
and
they
promised
to
use
them
if
the
need
came
meanwhile
the
flight
went
on
and
the
farther
it
went
the
sadder
it
became
children
became
exhausted
and
had
to
be
carried
by
people
so
tired
that
they
could
scarcely
walk
themselves
there
was
nobody
in
the
line
who
had
not
lost
some
beloved
one
on
that
fatal
river
bank
killed
in
battle
or
tortured
to
death
as
they
slowly
ascended
the
green
slope
of
the
mountain
that
inclosed
a
side
of
the
valley
they
looked
back
upon
ruin
and
desolation
the
whole
black
tragedy
was
being
consummated
they
could
see
the
houses
in
flames
and
they
knew
that
the
indian
war
parties
were
killing
and
scalping
everywhere
they
knew
too
that
other
bodies
of
fugitives
as
stricken
as
their
own
were
fleeing
into
the
mountains
they
scarcely
knew
whither
as
they
paused
a
few
moments
and
looked
back
a
great
cry
burst
from
the
weakest
of
the
women
and
children
then
it
became
a
sad
and
terrible
wail
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
it
ceased
it
was
an
awful
sound
so
compounded
of
despair
and
woe
and
of
longing
for
what
they
had
lost
that
henry
choked
and
the
tears
stood
in
paul
eyes
but
neither
the
five
nor
carpenter
made
any
attempt
to
check
the
wailing
they
thought
it
best
for
them
to
weep
it
out
but
they
hurried
the
column
as
much
as
they
could
often
carrying
some
of
the
smaller
children
themselves
paul
and
long
jim
were
the
best
as
comforters
the
two
knew
how
each
in
his
own
way
to
soothe
and
encourage
carpenter
who
knew
the
way
to
fort
penn
led
doggedly
on
scarcely
saying
a
word
henry
sol
and
tom
were
the
rear
guard
which
was
in
this
case
the
one
of
greatest
danger
and
responsibility
henry
was
thankful
that
it
was
only
early
summer
the
fourth
of
july
the
second
anniversary
of
the
declaration
of
that
the
foliage
was
heavy
and
green
on
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
in
this
mass
of
greenery
the
desolate
column
was
now
completely
hidden
from
any
observer
in
the
valley
and
he
believed
that
other
crowds
of
fugitives
would
be
hidden
in
the
same
manner
he
felt
sure
that
no
living
human
being
would
be
left
in
the
valley
that
it
would
be
ravaged
from
end
to
end
and
then
left
to
desolation
until
new
people
protected
by
american
bayonets
should
come
in
and
settle
it
again
at
last
they
passed
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
the
fires
in
the
valley
those
emblems
of
destruction
were
hidden
between
them
and
fort
penn
sixty
miles
away
stretched
a
wilderness
of
mountain
forest
and
swamp
but
the
five
welcomed
the
forest
a
foe
might
lie
there
in
ambush
but
they
could
not
see
the
fugitives
at
a
distance
what
the
latter
needed
now
was
obscurity
the
green
blanket
of
the
forest
to
hide
them
carpenter
led
on
over
a
narrow
trail
the
others
followed
almost
in
single
file
now
while
the
five
scouted
in
the
woods
on
either
flank
and
at
the
rear
henry
and
sol
generally
kept
together
and
they
fully
realized
the
overwhelming
danger
should
an
indian
band
even
as
small
as
ten
or
a
dozen
warriors
appear
should
the
latter
scatter
it
would
be
impossible
to
protect
all
the
women
and
children
from
their
tomahawks
the
day
was
warm
but
the
forest
gave
them
coolness
as
well
as
shelter
henry
and
sol
were
seldom
so
far
back
that
they
could
not
see
the
end
of
the
melancholy
line
now
moving
slowly
overborne
by
weariness
the
shiftless
one
shook
his
head
sadly
matter
what
happens
some
uv
will
never
get
out
o
these
his
words
came
true
all
too
soon
before
the
afternoon
closed
two
women
ill
before
the
flight
died
of
terror
and
exhaustion
and
were
buried
in
shallow
graves
under
the
trees
before
dark
a
halt
was
made
at
the
suggestion
of
henry
and
all
except
carpenter
and
the
scouts
sat
in
a
close
drooping
group
many
of
the
children
cried
though
the
women
had
all
ceased
to
weep
they
had
some
food
with
them
taken
in
the
hurried
flight
and
now
the
men
asked
them
to
eat
few
could
do
it
and
others
insisted
on
saving
what
little
they
had
for
the
children
long
jim
found
a
spring
near
by
and
all
drank
at
it
the
six
men
decided
that
although
night
had
not
yet
come
it
would
be
best
to
remain
there
until
the
morning
evidently
the
fugitives
were
in
no
condition
either
mental
or
physical
to
go
farther
that
day
and
the
rest
was
worth
more
than
the
risk
when
this
decision
was
announced
to
them
most
of
the
women
took
it
apathetically
soon
they
lay
down
upon
a
blanket
if
one
was
to
be
had
otherwise
on
leaves
and
branches
again
henry
thanked
god
that
it
was
summer
and
that
these
were
people
of
the
frontier
who
could
sleep
in
the
open
no
fire
was
needed
and
outside
of
human
enemies
only
rain
was
to
be
dreaded
and
yet
this
band
desperate
though
its
case
was
more
fortunate
than
some
of
the
others
that
fled
from
the
wyoming
valley
it
had
now
to
protect
it
six
men
henry
and
paul
though
boys
in
years
were
men
in
strength
and
ability
five
of
whom
were
the
equals
of
any
frontiersmen
on
the
whole
border
another
crowd
of
women
was
escorted
by
a
single
man
throughout
its
entire
flight
henry
and
his
comrades
distributed
themselves
in
a
circle
about
the
group
at
times
they
helped
gather
whortleberries
as
food
for
the
others
but
they
looked
for
indians
or
game
intending
to
shoot
in
either
case
when
paul
and
henry
were
together
they
once
heard
a
light
sound
in
a
thicket
which
at
first
they
were
afraid
was
made
by
an
indian
scout
but
it
was
a
deer
and
it
bounded
away
too
soon
for
either
to
get
a
shot
they
could
not
find
other
game
of
any
kind
and
they
came
back
toward
the
a
mere
stop
in
the
woods
without
shelter
of
any
kind
could
be
called
a
camp
the
sun
was
now
setting
blood
red
it
tinged
the
forest
with
a
fiery
mist
reminding
the
unhappy
group
of
all
that
they
had
seen
but
the
mist
was
gone
in
a
few
moments
and
then
the
blackness
of
night
came
with
a
weird
moaning
wind
that
told
of
desolation
most
of
the
children
having
passed
through
every
phase
of
exhaustion
and
terror
had
fallen
asleep
some
of
the
women
slept
also
and
others
wept
but
the
terrible
wailing
note
which
the
nerves
of
no
man
could
stand
was
heard
no
longer
the
five
gathered
again
at
a
point
near
by
and
carpenter
came
to
them
he
said
simply
know
much
about
you
though
i
know
you
fought
well
in
the
battle
that
we
lost
but
for
what
you
doin
now
nobody
can
ever
repay
you
i
knew
that
i
never
could
get
across
the
mountains
with
all
these
weak
the
five
merely
said
that
any
man
who
was
a
man
would
help
at
such
a
time
then
they
resumed
their
march
in
a
perpetual
circle
about
the
camp
some
women
did
not
sleep
at
all
that
night
it
is
not
easy
to
conceive
what
the
frontier
women
of
america
endured
so
many
thousands
of
times
they
had
seen
their
husbands
brothers
and
sons
killed
in
the
battle
and
they
knew
that
the
worst
of
torture
had
been
practiced
in
the
indian
camp
many
of
them
really
did
not
want
to
live
any
longer
they
merely
struggled
automatically
for
life
the
darkness
settled
down
thicker
and
thicker
the
blackness
in
the
forest
was
intense
and
they
could
see
the
faces
of
one
another
only
at
a
little
distance
the
desolate
moan
of
the
wind
came
through
the
leaves
and
although
it
was
july
the
night
grew
cold
the
women
crept
closer
together
trying
to
cover
up
and
protect
the
children
the
wind
with
its
inexpressibly
mournful
note
was
exactly
fitted
to
their
feelings
many
of
them
wondered
why
a
supreme
being
had
permitted
such
things
but
they
ceased
to
talk
no
sound
at
all
came
from
the
group
and
any
one
fifty
yards
away
not
forewarned
could
not
have
told
that
they
were
there
henry
and
paul
met
again
about
midnight
and
sat
a
long
time
on
a
little
hillock
theirs
had
been
the
most
dangerous
of
lives
on
the
most
dangerous
of
frontiers
but
they
had
never
been
stirred
as
they
were
tonight
even
paul
the
mildest
of
the
five
felt
something
burning
within
him
a
fire
that
only
one
thing
could
quench
said
he
trying
to
get
these
people
to
fort
penn
and
we
may
get
some
of
them
there
but
i
do
think
our
work
will
be
ended
them
i
do
think
i
could
ever
be
happy
again
if
we
went
straight
from
fort
penn
to
henry
understood
him
perfectly
paul
he
said
do
want
to
go
either
and
i
know
the
others
do
maybe
you
are
not
willing
to
tell
why
we
want
to
stay
but
it
is
vengeance
i
know
it
christian
to
forgive
your
enemies
but
i
see
what
i
have
seen
and
hear
what
i
have
heard
and
do
the
news
of
these
things
spreads
said
paul
send
an
army
from
the
east
sooner
or
later
they
just
have
to
do
it
to
punish
the
iroquois
and
their
white
allies
and
we
got
to
be
here
to
join
that
feel
that
way
too
paul
said
henry
they
were
joined
later
by
the
other
three
who
stayed
a
little
while
and
they
were
in
accord
with
henry
and
paul
then
they
began
their
circles
about
the
camp
again
always
looking
and
always
listening
about
two
in
the
morning
they
heard
a
scream
but
it
was
only
the
cry
of
a
panther
before
day
there
were
clouds
a
low
rumble
of
distant
thunder
and
faint
far
flashes
of
lightning
henry
was
in
dread
of
rain
but
the
lightning
and
thunder
ceased
and
the
clouds
went
away
then
dawn
came
rosy
and
bright
and
all
but
three
rose
from
the
earth
the
woman
and
two
died
in
silence
in
the
night
and
they
were
buried
like
the
others
in
shallow
graves
in
the
woods
but
there
was
little
weeping
or
external
mourning
over
them
all
were
now
heavy
and
apathetic
capable
of
but
little
more
emotion
carpenter
resumed
his
position
at
the
head
of
the
column
which
now
moved
slowly
over
the
mountain
through
a
thick
forest
matted
with
vines
and
bushes
and
without
a
path
the
march
was
now
so
painful
and
difficult
that
they
did
not
make
more
than
two
miles
an
hour
the
stronger
of
them
helped
the
men
to
gather
more
whortleberries
as
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
food
they
had
with
them
would
never
last
until
they
reached
fort
penn
should
they
ever
reach
it
the
condition
of
the
country
into
which
they
had
entered
steadily
grew
worse
they
were
well
into
the
mountains
a
region
exceedingly
wild
and
rough
but
little
known
to
the
settlers
who
had
gone
around
it
to
build
homes
in
the
fertile
and
beautiful
valley
of
wyoming
the
heavy
forest
was
made
all
the
more
difficult
by
the
presence
everywhere
of
almost
impassable
undergrowth
now
and
then
a
woman
lay
down
under
the
bushes
and
in
two
cases
they
died
there
because
the
power
to
live
was
no
longer
in
them
they
grew
weaker
and
weaker
the
food
that
they
had
brought
from
the
wyoming
fort
was
almost
exhausted
and
the
wild
whortleberries
were
far
from
sustaining
fortunately
there
was
plenty
of
water
flowing
tinder
the
dark
woods
and
along
the
mountainside
but
they
were
compelled
to
stop
at
intervals
of
an
hour
or
two
to
rest
and
the
more
timid
continually
expected
indian
ambush
the
five
met
shortly
after
noon
and
took
another
reckoning
of
the
situation
they
still
realized
to
the
full
the
dangers
of
indian
pursuit
which
in
this
case
might
be
a
mere
matter
of
accident
anybody
could
follow
the
broad
trail
left
by
the
fugitives
but
the
iroquois
busy
with
destruction
in
the
valley
might
not
follow
even
if
they
saw
it
no
one
could
tell
the
danger
of
starvation
or
of
death
from
exhaustion
was
more
imminent
more
pressing
and
the
five
resolved
to
let
scouting
alone
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
seek
game
bound
to
be
a
lot
of
it
in
these
woods
said
sol
it
frightened
out
of
the
path
by
our
big
crowd
but
we
ought
to
find
henry
and
sol
went
in
one
direction
and
paul
tom
and
long
jim
in
another
but
with
all
their
hunting
they
succeeded
in
finding
only
one
little
deer
which
fell
to
the
rifle
of
silent
tom
it
made
small
enough
portions
for
the
supper
and
breakfast
of
nearly
a
hundred
people
but
it
helped
wonderfully
and
so
did
the
fires
which
henry
and
his
comrades
would
now
have
built
even
had
they
not
been
needed
for
the
cooking
they
saw
that
light
and
warmth
the
light
and
warmth
of
glowing
coals
would
alone
rouse
life
in
this
desolate
band
they
slept
the
second
night
on
the
ground
among
the
trees
and
the
next
morning
they
entered
that
gloomy
region
of
terrible
memory
the
great
dismal
swamp
of
the
north
known
sometimes
to
this
day
as
shades
of
chapter
xii
the
shades
of
death
shades
of
is
a
marsh
on
a
mountain
top
the
great
wet
and
soggy
plain
of
the
pocono
and
broad
mountains
when
the
fugitives
from
wyoming
entered
it
it
was
covered
with
a
dense
growth
of
pines
growing
mostly
out
of
dark
murky
water
which
in
its
turn
was
thick
with
a
growth
of
moss
and
aquatic
plants
snakes
and
all
kinds
of
creeping
things
swarmed
in
the
ooze
bear
and
panther
were
numerous
carpenter
did
not
know
any
way
around
this
terrible
region
and
they
were
compelled
to
enter
it
henry
was
again
devoutly
thankful
that
it
was
summer
in
such
a
situation
with
winter
on
top
of
it
only
the
hardiest
of
men
could
survive
but
they
entered
the
swamp
carpenter
silent
and
dogged
still
leading
henry
and
his
comrades
kept
close
to
the
crowd
one
could
not
scout
in
such
a
morass
and
it
proved
to
be
worse
than
they
had
feared
the
day
turned
gray
and
it
was
dark
among
the
trees
the
whole
place
was
filled
with
gloomy
shadows
it
was
often
impossible
to
judge
whether
fairly
solid
soil
or
oozy
murk
lay
before
them
often
they
went
down
to
their
waists
sometimes
the
children
fell
and
were
dragged
up
again
by
the
stronger
now
and
then
rattle
snakes
coiled
and
hissed
and
the
women
killed
them
with
sticks
other
serpents
slipped
away
in
the
slime
everybody
was
plastered
with
mud
and
they
became
mere
images
of
human
beings
in
the
afternoon
they
reached
a
sort
of
oasis
in
the
terrible
swamp
and
there
they
buried
two
more
of
their
number
who
had
perished
from
exhaustion
the
rest
save
a
few
lay
upon
the
ground
as
if
dead
on
all
sides
of
them
stretched
the
pines
and
the
soft
black
earth
it
looked
to
the
fugitives
like
a
region
into
which
no
human
beings
had
ever
come
or
ever
would
come
again
and
alas
to
most
of
them
like
a
region
from
which
no
human
being
would
ever
emerge
henry
sat
upon
a
piece
of
fallen
brushwood
near
the
edge
of
the
morass
and
looked
at
the
fugitives
and
his
heart
sank
within
him
they
were
hardly
in
the
likeness
of
his
own
kind
and
they
seemed
practically
lifeless
now
everything
was
dull
heavy
and
dead
the
note
of
the
wind
among
the
leaves
was
somber
a
long
black
snake
slipped
from
the
marshy
grass
near
his
feet
and
disappeared
soundlessly
in
the
water
he
was
sick
sick
to
death
at
the
sight
of
so
much
suffering
and
the
desire
for
vengeance
slow
cold
and
far
more
lasting
than
any
hot
outburst
grew
within
him
a
slight
noise
and
sol
stood
beside
him
you
hear
asked
the
shiftless
one
in
a
significant
tone
what
asked
henry
who
had
been
deep
in
thought
wolf
howl
just
a
very
little
cry
very
far
away
an
under
the
horizon
but
thar
all
the
same
listen
thar
she
goes
henry
bent
his
ear
and
distinctly
heard
the
faint
whining
note
and
then
it
came
a
third
time
he
looked
tip
at
sol
and
his
face
grew
white
but
not
for
himself
said
sol
he
understood
the
look
are
pursued
them
wolves
howlin
are
the
iroquois
what
do
you
reckon
we
goin
to
do
henry
replied
the
youth
with
fierce
energy
off
henry
circled
the
little
oasis
with
the
eye
of
a
general
and
his
plan
came
stand
here
where
the
earth
gives
a
footing
he
said
solomon
hyde
as
brave
a
man
as
i
ever
saw
and
with
you
will
be
paul
cotter
tom
ross
jim
hart
and
henry
ware
old
friends
of
yours
carpenter
will
at
once
lead
the
women
and
children
on
ahead
and
perhaps
they
will
not
hear
the
battle
that
is
going
to
be
fought
a
smile
of
approval
slow
but
deep
and
comprehensive
stole
over
the
face
of
solomon
hyde
surnamed
wholly
without
fitness
the
shiftless
one
seems
to
me
he
said
i
heard
o
them
four
fellers
you
talkin
about
an
ef
i
wuz
to
hunt
all
over
this
planet
an
them
other
planets
that
paul
tells
of
i
could
find
four
other
fellers
that
i
ez
soon
have
with
got
to
stand
here
to
the
death
said
henry
shorely
right
said
sol
the
hands
of
the
two
comrades
met
in
a
grip
of
steel
the
other
three
were
called
and
were
told
of
the
plan
which
met
with
their
full
approval
then
the
news
was
carried
to
carpenter
who
quickly
agreed
that
their
course
was
the
wisest
he
urged
all
the
fugitives
to
their
feet
telling
them
that
they
must
reach
another
dry
place
before
night
but
they
were
past
asking
questions
now
and
heavy
and
apathetic
they
passed
on
into
the
swamp
paul
watched
the
last
of
them
disappear
among
the
black
bushes
and
weeds
and
turned
back
to
his
friends
on
the
oasis
the
five
lay
down
behind
a
big
fallen
pine
and
gave
their
weapons
a
last
look
they
had
never
been
armed
better
their
rifles
were
good
and
the
fine
pistols
formidable
weapons
would
be
a
great
aid
especially
at
close
quarters
take
it
said
tom
ross
the
iroquois
ca
get
through
at
all
unless
they
come
along
this
way
an
it
the
same
ez
ef
we
wuz
on
solid
earth
poppin
em
over
while
they
come
sloshin
up
to
exactly
it
said
henry
a
natural
defense
which
we
can
hold
against
much
greater
numbers
and
the
longer
we
hold
off
the
nearer
our
people
will
be
to
fort
never
felt
more
like
fightin
in
my
life
said
tom
ross
it
was
a
grim
utterance
true
of
them
all
although
not
one
among
them
was
bloodthirsty
any
of
you
hear
anything
asked
henry
replied
sol
after
a
little
wait
from
the
women
goin
nothin
from
the
iroquois
just
lie
close
said
henry
hard
spot
of
ground
is
more
than
thirty
or
forty
feet
each
way
and
nobody
can
get
on
it
without
our
knowing
the
others
did
not
reply
all
lay
motionless
upon
their
sides
with
their
shoulders
raised
a
little
in
order
that
they
might
take
instant
aim
when
the
time
came
some
rays
of
the
sun
penetrated
the
canopy
of
pines
and
fell
across
the
brown
determined
faces
and
the
lean
brown
hands
that
grasped
the
long
kentucky
rifles
another
snake
slipped
from
the
ground
into
the
black
water
and
swam
away
some
water
animal
made
a
light
splash
as
he
too
swam
from
the
presence
of
these
strange
intruders
then
they
beard
a
sighing
sound
as
of
a
foot
drawn
from
mud
and
they
knew
that
the
iroquois
were
approaching
savages
in
war
whatever
they
might
be
otherwise
and
expecting
an
easy
prey
five
brown
thumbs
cocked
their
rifles
and
five
brown
forefingers
rested
upon
the
triggers
the
eyes
of
woodsmen
who
seldom
missed
looked
down
the
sights
the
sound
of
feet
in
the
mud
came
many
times
the
enemy
was
evidently
drawing
near
many
do
you
think
are
out
thar
whispered
sol
to
henry
at
least
it
seems
to
me
by
the
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
shoot
at
the
first
head
we
but
we
must
all
fire
at
the
same
it
was
suggested
that
henry
call
off
the
turns
of
the
marksmen
and
he
agreed
to
do
so
sol
was
to
fire
first
the
sounds
now
ceased
the
iroquois
evidently
had
some
feeling
or
instinct
that
they
were
approaching
an
enemy
who
was
to
be
feared
not
weak
and
unarmed
women
and
children
the
five
were
absolutely
motionless
finger
on
trigger
the
american
wilderness
had
heroes
without
number
it
was
horatius
cocles
five
times
over
ready
to
defend
the
bridge
with
life
over
the
marsh
rose
the
weird
cry
of
an
owl
and
some
water
birds
called
in
lonely
fashion
henry
judged
that
the
fugitives
were
now
three
quarters
of
a
mile
away
out
of
the
sound
of
rifle
shot
he
had
urged
carpenter
to
marshal
them
on
as
far
as
he
could
but
the
silence
endured
yet
a
while
longer
in
the
dull
gray
light
of
the
somber
day
and
the
waning
afternoon
the
marsh
was
increasingly
dreary
and
mournful
it
seemed
that
it
must
always
be
the
abode
of
dead
or
dying
things
the
wet
grass
forty
yards
away
moved
a
little
and
between
the
boughs
appeared
the
segment
of
a
hideous
dark
face
the
painted
brow
the
savage
black
eyes
and
the
hooked
nose
of
the
mohawk
only
henry
saw
it
but
with
fierce
tortures
at
wyoming
leaped
up
before
fired
at
the
painted
brow
the
mohawk
uttered
his
death
cry
and
fell
back
with
a
splash
into
the
mud
and
water
of
the
swamp
a
half
dozen
bullets
were
instantly
fired
at
the
base
of
the
smoke
that
came
from
henry
rifle
but
the
youth
and
his
comrades
lay
close
and
were
unharmed
sol
and
tom
were
quick
enough
to
catch
glimpses
of
brown
forms
at
which
they
fired
and
the
cries
coming
back
told
that
they
had
hit
something
said
henry
or
two
iroquois
at
least
will
not
wear
the
scalp
of
white
woman
or
child
at
their
they
try
to
rush
us
said
sol
never
felt
so
full
of
fight
in
my
life
may
try
it
said
henry
understand
that
at
the
big
battle
of
the
oriskany
farther
up
in
the
north
the
iroquois
would
wait
until
a
white
man
behind
a
tree
would
fire
then
they
would
rush
up
and
tomahawk
him
before
he
could
do
know
how
fast
we
kin
reload
said
long
jim
they
know
that
we
got
these
pistols
they
do
said
henry
it
a
great
thing
for
us
to
have
them
suppose
we
spread
out
a
little
so
long
as
we
keep
them
from
getting
a
lodging
on
the
solid
earth
we
hold
them
at
a
great
henry
and
paul
moved
off
a
little
toward
the
right
and
the
others
toward
the
left
they
still
had
good
cover
as
fallen
timber
was
scattered
all
over
the
oasis
and
they
were
quite
sure
that
another
attack
would
be
made
soon
it
came
in
about
fifteen
minutes
the
iroquois
suddenly
fired
a
volley
at
the
logs
and
brush
and
when
the
five
returned
the
fire
but
with
more
deadly
effect
they
leaped
forward
in
the
mud
and
attempted
to
rush
the
oasis
tomahawk
in
hand
but
the
five
reloaded
so
quickly
that
they
were
able
to
send
in
a
second
volley
before
the
foremost
of
the
iroquois
could
touch
foot
on
solid
earth
then
the
double
barreled
pistols
came
into
play
the
bullets
sent
from
short
range
drove
back
the
savages
who
were
amazed
at
such
a
deadly
and
continued
fire
henry
caught
sight
of
a
white
face
among
these
assailants
and
he
knew
it
to
be
that
of
braxton
wyatt
singularly
enough
he
was
not
amazed
to
see
it
there
wyatt
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
savagery
and
cruelty
was
just
the
one
to
lead
the
iroquois
in
such
a
pursuit
he
was
a
fit
match
for
walter
butler
the
infamous
son
of
the
indian
leader
who
was
soon
to
prove
himself
worse
than
the
worst
of
the
savages
as
thayendanegea
himself
has
written
henry
drew
a
bead
once
on
braxton
had
no
scruples
now
about
shooting
just
as
he
was
about
to
pull
the
trigger
wyatt
darted
behind
a
bush
and
a
seneca
instead
received
the
bullet
he
also
saw
the
renegade
blackstaffe
but
he
was
not
able
to
secure
a
shot
at
him
either
nevertheless
the
iroquois
attack
was
beaten
back
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
result
would
be
so
unless
the
force
was
in
great
numbers
it
is
likely
also
that
the
iroquois
at
first
had
thought
only
a
single
man
was
with
the
fugitives
not
knowing
that
the
five
had
joined
them
later
two
of
the
iroquois
were
slain
at
the
very
edge
of
the
solid
ground
but
their
bodies
fell
back
in
the
slime
and
the
others
retreating
fast
for
their
lives
could
not
carry
them
off
paul
with
a
kind
of
fascinated
horror
watched
the
dead
painted
bodies
sink
deeper
then
one
was
entirely
gone
the
hand
of
the
other
alone
was
left
and
then
it
too
was
gone
but
the
five
had
held
the
island
and
carpenter
was
leading
the
fugitives
on
toward
fort
penn
they
had
not
only
held
it
but
they
believed
that
they
could
continue
to
hold
it
against
anything
and
their
hearts
became
exultant
something
too
to
balance
against
the
long
score
lay
out
there
in
the
swamp
and
all
the
five
bitter
over
wyoming
were
sorry
that
braxton
wyatt
was
not
among
them
the
stillness
came
again
the
sun
did
not
break
through
the
heavy
gray
sky
and
the
somber
shadows
brooded
over
shades
of
they
heard
again
the
splash
of
water
animals
and
a
swimming
snake
passed
on
the
murky
surface
then
they
heard
the
wolf
long
cry
and
the
long
cry
of
wolf
replying
iroquois
coming
said
sol
we
gave
them
a
pretty
warm
how
d
do
an
with
our
rifles
and
pistols
thinkin
that
we
kin
do
it
can
except
in
one
case
said
henry
the
new
party
brings
their
numbers
up
to
fifty
or
sixty
and
they
wait
for
night
they
can
surround
us
in
the
darkness
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
slip
away
when
twilight
comes
carpenter
and
the
train
have
a
long
lead
said
sol
what
in
tarnation
is
that
white
flag
said
paul
a
piece
of
cloth
that
had
once
been
white
had
been
hoisted
on
the
barrel
of
a
rifle
at
a
point
about
sixty
yards
away
want
a
talk
with
us
said
henry
it
braxton
wyatt
said
long
jim
like
to
take
a
shot
at
him
talk
or
no
talk
an
ef
i
missed
then
take
see
what
they
have
to
say
said
henry
and
he
called
aloud
do
you
want
with
us
talk
with
you
replied
a
clear
full
voice
not
that
of
braxton
wyatt
well
replied
henry
yourself
and
we
will
not
fire
upon
a
tall
figure
was
upraised
upon
a
grassy
hummock
and
the
hands
were
held
aloft
in
sign
of
peace
it
was
a
splendid
figure
at
least
six
feet
four
inches
in
height
at
that
moment
some
rays
of
the
setting
sun
broke
through
the
gray
clouds
and
shone
full
upon
it
lighting
up
the
defiant
scalp
lock
interwoven
with
the
brilliant
red
feather
the
eagle
face
with
the
curved
roman
beak
and
the
mighty
shoulders
and
chest
of
red
bronze
it
was
a
genuine
king
of
the
wilderness
none
other
than
the
mighty
timmendiquas
himself
the
great
white
lightning
of
the
wyandots
he
said
would
speak
with
you
let
us
talk
as
one
chief
to
the
five
were
amazed
timmendiquas
there
they
were
quite
sure
that
he
had
come
up
with
the
second
force
and
he
was
certain
to
prove
a
far
more
formidable
leader
than
either
braxton
wyatt
or
moses
blackstaffe
but
his
demand
to
speak
with
henry
ware
might
mean
something
you
going
to
answer
him
said
sol
course
replied
henry
others
especially
wyatt
and
blackstaffe
might
while
timmendiquas
holds
the
flag
of
truce
they
would
not
henry
stood
up
raising
himself
to
his
full
height
the
same
ruddy
sunlight
piercing
the
somber
gray
of
the
clouds
fell
upon
another
splendid
figure
a
boy
only
in
years
but
far
beyond
the
average
height
of
man
his
hair
yellow
his
eyes
a
deep
clear
blue
his
body
clothed
in
buckskin
and
his
whole
attitude
that
of
one
without
fear
the
two
the
white
and
the
red
kings
of
their
kind
confronted
each
other
across
the
marsh
do
you
wish
with
me
timmendiquas
asked
henry
in
the
presence
of
the
great
wyandot
chief
the
feeling
of
hate
and
revenge
that
had
held
his
heart
vanished
he
knew
that
paul
and
sol
would
have
sunk
under
the
ruthless
tomahawk
of
queen
esther
if
it
had
not
been
for
white
lightning
he
himself
had
owed
him
his
life
on
another
and
more
distant
occasion
and
he
was
not
ungrateful
so
there
was
warmth
in
his
tone
when
he
spoke
us
meet
at
the
edge
of
the
solid
ground
said
timmendiquas
have
things
to
say
that
are
important
and
that
you
will
be
glad
to
henry
walked
without
hesitation
to
the
edge
of
the
swamp
and
the
young
chief
coming
forward
met
him
henry
held
out
his
hand
in
white
fashion
and
the
young
chief
took
it
there
was
no
sound
either
from
the
swamp
or
from
those
who
lay
behind
the
logs
on
the
island
but
some
of
the
eyes
of
those
hidden
in
the
swamps
watched
both
with
burning
hatred
wish
to
tell
you
ware
said
timmendiquas
speaking
with
the
dignity
becoming
a
great
chief
it
was
not
i
who
led
the
pursuit
of
the
white
men
women
and
children
i
and
the
wyandots
who
came
with
me
fought
as
best
we
could
in
the
great
battle
and
i
will
slay
my
enemies
when
i
can
we
are
warriors
and
we
are
ready
to
face
each
other
in
battle
but
we
do
not
seek
to
kill
the
squaw
in
the
tepee
or
the
papoose
in
its
the
face
of
the
great
chief
seemed
stirred
by
some
deep
emotion
which
impressed
henry
all
the
more
because
the
countenance
of
timmendiquas
was
usually
a
mask
believe
that
you
tell
the
truth
said
henry
gravely
and
my
wyandots
continued
the
chief
a
trail
through
the
woods
we
found
that
others
senecas
and
mohawks
led
by
wyatt
and
blackstaffe
who
are
of
your
race
had
gone
before
and
when
we
came
up
there
had
just
been
a
battle
the
mohawks
and
senecas
had
been
driven
back
it
was
then
we
learned
that
the
trail
was
made
by
women
and
little
children
save
you
and
your
comrades
who
stayed
to
fight
and
protect
speak
true
words
timmendiquas
said
henry
wyandots
have
remained
in
the
east
to
fight
men
not
to
kill
squaws
and
papooses
continued
timmendiquas
i
say
to
you
go
on
with
those
who
flee
across
the
mountains
our
warriors
shall
not
pursue
you
any
longer
we
will
turn
back
to
the
valley
from
which
we
come
and
those
of
your
race
blackstaffe
and
wyatt
shall
go
with
the
great
chief
spoke
quietly
but
there
was
an
edge
to
his
tone
that
told
that
every
word
was
meant
henry
felt
a
glow
of
admiration
the
true
greatness
of
timmendiquas
spoke
the
iroquois
he
said
they
go
back
with
you
will
they
have
killed
too
much
today
all
the
white
people
in
the
valley
are
killed
or
driven
away
many
scalps
have
been
taken
those
of
women
and
children
too
and
men
have
died
at
the
stake
i
have
felt
shame
for
their
deeds
ware
and
it
will
bring
punishment
upon
my
brethren
the
iroquois
it
will
make
so
great
a
noise
in
the
world
that
many
soldiers
will
come
and
the
villages
of
the
iroquois
will
cease
to
think
it
is
so
timmendiquas
said
henry
you
will
be
far
away
then
in
your
own
the
chief
drew
himself
up
a
little
shall
remain
with
the
iroquois
he
said
have
promised
to
help
them
and
i
must
do
ca
blame
you
for
that
said
henry
i
am
glad
that
you
do
not
seek
the
scalps
of
women
and
children
we
are
at
once
enemies
and
friends
white
lightning
bowed
gravely
he
and
henry
touched
hands
again
and
each
withdrew
the
chief
into
the
morass
while
henry
walked
back
toward
his
comrades
holding
himself
erect
as
if
no
enemy
were
near
the
four
rose
up
to
greet
him
they
had
heard
part
of
what
was
said
and
henry
quickly
told
them
the
rest
shorely
a
great
chief
said
sol
keep
his
word
too
them
people
on
ahead
ai
got
anything
more
to
fear
from
a
statesman
too
said
henry
sees
what
damage
the
deeds
of
wyoming
valley
will
do
to
those
who
have
done
them
he
thinks
our
people
will
now
send
a
great
army
against
the
iroquois
and
i
think
so
nation
can
stand
a
thing
like
that
said
paul
i
did
dream
it
could
they
now
left
the
oasis
and
went
swiftly
along
the
trail
left
by
the
fugitives
all
of
them
had
confidence
in
the
word
of
timmendiquas
there
was
a
remote
chance
that
some
other
band
had
entered
the
swamp
at
a
different
point
but
it
was
remote
indeed
and
it
did
not
trouble
them
much
night
was
now
over
the
great
swamp
the
sun
no
longer
came
through
the
gray
clouds
but
here
and
there
were
little
flashes
of
flame
made
by
fireflies
had
not
the
trail
been
so
broad
and
deep
it
could
easily
have
been
lost
but
being
what
it
was
the
skilled
eyes
of
the
frontiersmen
followed
it
without
trouble
uv
are
gittin
tired
said
tom
ross
looking
at
the
tracks
in
the
mud
then
he
suddenly
added
whar
one
quit
a
shallow
grave
not
an
hour
old
had
been
made
under
some
bushes
and
its
length
indicated
that
a
woman
lay
there
they
passed
it
by
in
silence
henry
now
appreciated
more
fully
than
ever
the
mercy
of
timmendiquas
the
five
and
carpenter
could
not
possibly
have
protected
the
miserable
fugitives
against
the
great
chief
with
fifty
wyandots
and
iroquois
at
his
back
timmendiquas
knew
this
and
he
had
done
what
none
of
the
indians
or
white
allies
around
him
would
have
done
in
another
hour
they
saw
a
man
standing
among
some
vines
but
watchful
and
with
his
rifle
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
it
was
carpenter
a
man
whose
task
was
not
less
than
that
of
the
five
they
were
in
the
thick
of
it
and
could
see
what
was
done
but
he
had
to
lead
on
and
wait
he
counted
the
dusk
figures
as
they
approached
him
one
two
three
four
five
and
perhaps
no
man
ever
felt
greater
relief
he
advanced
toward
them
and
said
huskily
was
no
fight
they
did
not
attack
was
a
fight
said
henry
we
beat
them
back
then
a
second
and
a
larger
force
came
up
but
it
was
composed
chiefly
of
wyandots
led
by
their
great
chief
timmendiquas
he
came
forward
and
said
that
they
would
not
pursue
women
and
children
and
that
we
could
go
in
carpenter
looked
incredulous
is
true
said
henry
word
of
is
more
than
brant
would
have
done
said
carpenter
it
saves
us
with
your
were
first
and
the
first
credit
is
yours
carpenter
said
henry
sincerely
they
did
not
tell
the
women
and
children
of
the
fight
at
the
oasis
but
they
spread
the
news
that
there
would
be
no
more
pursuit
and
many
drooping
spirits
revived
they
spent
another
day
in
the
great
dismal
swamp
where
more
lives
were
lost
on
the
day
after
their
emergence
from
the
marsh
henry
and
his
comrades
killed
two
deer
which
furnished
greatly
needed
food
and
on
the
day
after
that
excepting
those
who
had
died
by
the
way
they
reached
fort
penn
where
they
were
received
into
shelter
and
safety
the
night
before
the
fugitives
reached
fort
penn
the
iroquois
began
the
celebration
of
the
thanksgiving
dance
for
their
great
victory
and
the
many
scalps
taken
at
wyoming
they
could
not
recall
another
time
when
they
had
secured
so
many
of
these
hideous
trophies
and
they
were
drunk
with
the
joy
of
victory
many
of
the
tories
some
in
their
own
clothes
and
some
painted
and
dressed
like
indians
took
part
in
it
according
to
their
ancient
and
honored
custom
they
held
a
grand
council
to
prepare
for
it
all
the
leading
chiefs
were
present
sangerachte
hiokatoo
and
the
others
braxton
wyatt
blackstaffe
and
other
white
men
were
admitted
after
their
deliberations
a
great
fire
was
built
in
the
center
of
the
camp
the
squaws
who
had
followed
the
army
feeding
it
with
brushwood
until
it
leaped
and
roared
and
formed
a
great
red
pyramid
then
the
chiefs
sat
down
in
a
solemn
circle
at
some
distance
and
waited
presently
the
sound
of
a
loud
chant
was
heard
and
from
the
farthest
point
of
the
camp
emerged
a
long
line
of
warriors
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
all
painted
in
red
and
black
with
horrible
designs
they
were
naked
except
the
breechcloth
and
moccasins
and
everyone
waved
aloft
a
tomahawk
as
he
sang
still
singing
and
brandishing
the
tomahawks
which
gleamed
in
the
red
light
the
long
procession
entered
the
open
space
and
danced
and
wheeled
about
the
great
fire
the
flames
casting
a
lurid
light
upon
faces
hideous
with
paint
or
the
intoxication
of
triumph
the
glare
of
their
black
eyes
was
like
those
of
eastern
eaters
of
hasheesh
or
opium
and
they
bounded
to
and
fro
as
if
their
muscles
were
springs
of
steel
they
sang
we
have
met
the
bostonians
in
battle
we
slew
them
with
our
rifles
and
tomahawks
few
there
are
who
escaped
our
warriors
is
the
league
of
the
note
all
the
americans
were
often
called
bostonians
by
the
indians
as
late
as
the
revolutionary
war
mighty
has
been
our
taking
of
scalps
they
will
fill
all
the
lodges
of
the
iroquois
we
have
burned
the
houses
of
the
bostonians
is
the
league
of
the
the
wolf
will
prowl
in
their
the
grass
will
grow
where
their
blood
has
soaked
their
bones
will
lie
for
the
buzzard
to
pick
is
the
league
of
the
we
came
upon
them
by
river
and
forest
as
we
smote
wyoming
we
will
smite
the
others
we
will
drive
the
bostonians
back
to
the
sea
is
the
league
of
the
the
monotonous
chant
with
the
refrain
is
the
league
of
the
went
on
for
many
verses
meanwhile
the
old
squaws
never
ceased
to
feed
the
bonfire
and
the
flames
roared
casting
a
deeper
and
more
vivid
light
over
the
distorted
faces
of
the
dancers
and
those
of
the
chiefs
who
sat
gravely
beyond
higher
and
higher
leaped
the
warriors
they
seemed
unconscious
of
fatigue
and
the
glare
in
their
eyes
became
that
of
maniacs
their
whole
souls
were
possessed
by
the
orgy
beads
of
sweat
not
of
exhaustion
but
of
emotional
excitement
appeared
upon
their
faces
and
naked
bodies
and
the
red
and
black
paint
streaked
together
horribly
for
a
long
time
this
went
on
and
then
the
warriors
ceased
suddenly
to
sing
although
they
continued
their
dance
a
moment
later
a
cry
which
thrilled
every
nerve
came
from
a
far
point
in
the
dark
background
it
was
the
scalp
yell
the
most
terrible
of
all
indian
cries
long
and
quavering
having
in
it
something
of
the
barking
howl
of
the
wolf
and
the
fiendish
shriek
of
a
murderous
maniac
the
warriors
instantly
took
it
up
and
gave
it
back
in
a
gigantic
chorus
a
ghastly
figure
bounded
into
the
circle
of
the
firelight
it
was
that
of
a
woman
tall
and
powerful
naked
to
the
waist
her
body
covered
with
red
and
black
paint
her
long
black
hair
hanging
in
a
loose
cloud
down
her
back
she
held
a
fresh
scalp
taken
from
a
white
head
aloft
in
either
band
it
was
catharine
montour
and
it
was
she
who
had
first
emitted
the
scalp
yell
after
her
came
more
warriors
all
bearing
scalps
the
scalp
yell
was
supposed
to
be
uttered
for
every
scalp
taken
and
as
they
had
taken
more
than
three
hundred
it
did
not
cease
for
hours
penetrating
every
part
of
the
forest
all
the
time
catharine
montour
led
the
dance
none
bounded
higher
than
she
none
grimaced
more
horribly
while
they
danced
six
men
with
their
hands
tied
behind
them
and
black
caps
on
their
heads
were
brought
forth
and
paraded
around
amid
hoots
and
yells
and
brandishing
of
tomahawks
in
their
faces
they
were
the
surviving
prisoners
and
the
black
caps
meant
that
they
were
to
be
killed
and
scalped
on
the
morrow
stupefied
by
all
through
which
they
had
gone
they
were
scarcely
conscious
now
midnight
came
the
iroquois
still
danced
and
sang
and
the
calm
stars
looked
down
upon
the
savage
and
awful
scene
now
the
dancers
began
to
weary
many
dropped
unconscious
and
the
others
danced
about
them
where
they
lay
after
a
while
all
ceased
then
the
chiefs
brought
forth
a
white
dog
which
hiokatoo
killed
and
threw
on
the
embers
of
the
fire
when
it
was
thoroughly
roasted
the
chiefs
cut
it
in
pieces
and
ate
it
thus
closed
the
festival
of
thanksgiving
for
the
victory
of
wyoming
chapter
xiii
a
forest
page
when
the
survivors
of
the
band
of
wyoming
fugitives
that
the
five
had
helped
were
behind
the
walls
of
fort
penn
securing
the
food
and
rest
they
needed
so
greatly
henry
ware
and
his
comrades
felt
themselves
relieved
of
a
great
responsibility
they
were
also
aware
how
much
they
owed
to
timmendiquas
because
few
of
the
indians
and
renegades
would
have
been
so
forbearing
thayendanegea
seemed
to
them
inferior
to
the
great
wyandot
often
when
brant
could
prevent
the
torture
of
the
prisoners
and
the
slaughter
of
women
and
children
he
did
not
do
it
the
five
could
never
forget
these
things
in
after
life
when
brant
was
glorified
as
a
great
warrior
and
leader
their
minds
always
turned
to
timmendiquas
as
the
highest
and
finest
of
indian
types
while
they
were
at
fort
penn
two
other
parties
came
in
a
fearful
state
of
exhaustion
and
also
having
paid
the
usual
toll
of
death
on
the
way
other
groups
reached
the
moravian
towns
where
they
were
received
with
all
kindness
by
the
german
settlers
the
five
were
able
to
give
some
help
to
several
of
these
parties
but
the
beautiful
wyoming
valley
lay
utterly
in
ruins
the
ruthless
fury
of
the
savages
and
of
many
of
the
tories
canadians
and
englishmen
can
scarcely
be
told
everything
was
slaughtered
or
burned
as
a
habitation
of
human
beings
or
of
anything
pertaining
to
human
beings
the
valley
for
a
time
ceased
to
be
an
entire
population
was
either
annihilated
or
driven
out
and
finally
butler
army
finding
that
nothing
more
was
left
to
be
destroyed
gathered
in
its
war
parties
and
marched
northward
with
a
vast
store
of
spoils
in
which
scalps
were
conspicuous
when
they
repassed
tioga
point
timmendiquas
and
his
wyandots
were
still
with
them
thayendanegea
was
also
with
them
here
and
so
was
walter
butler
who
was
destined
shortly
to
make
a
reputation
equaling
that
of
his
father
butler
nor
had
the
terrible
queen
esther
ever
left
them
she
marched
at
the
head
of
the
army
singing
horrid
chants
of
victory
and
swinging
the
great
war
tomahawk
which
did
not
often
leave
her
hand
the
whole
force
was
upon
the
susquehanna
and
it
was
still
full
of
the
impulse
of
savage
triumph
wild
indian
songs
floated
along
the
stream
or
through
the
meadows
which
were
quiet
now
they
advanced
at
their
ease
knowing
that
there
was
nobody
to
attack
them
but
they
were
watched
by
five
woodsmen
two
of
whom
were
boys
meanwhile
the
story
of
wyoming
to
an
extent
that
neither
indians
nor
woodsmen
themselves
suspected
was
spreading
from
town
to
town
in
the
east
to
invade
thence
the
whole
civilized
world
and
to
stir
up
an
indignation
and
horror
that
would
make
the
name
wyoming
long
memorable
wyoming
had
been
a
victory
for
the
flag
under
which
the
invaders
fought
but
it
sadly
tarnished
the
cause
of
that
flag
and
the
consequences
were
to
be
seen
soon
henry
ware
paul
cotter
sol
hyde
tom
ross
and
jim
hart
were
thinking
little
of
distant
consequences
but
they
were
eager
for
the
present
punishment
of
these
men
who
had
committed
so
much
cruelty
from
the
bushes
they
could
easily
follow
the
canoes
and
could
recognize
some
of
their
occupants
in
one
of
the
rear
boats
sat
braxton
wyatt
and
a
young
man
whom
they
knew
to
be
walter
butler
a
pallid
young
man
animated
by
the
most
savage
ferocity
against
the
patriots
he
and
wyatt
seemed
to
be
on
the
best
of
terms
and
faint
echoes
of
their
laughter
came
to
the
five
who
were
watching
among
the
bushes
on
the
river
bank
certainly
braxton
wyatt
and
he
were
a
pair
well
met
said
sol
longingly
think
i
could
jest
about
reach
braxton
wyatt
with
a
bullet
from
here
i
ai
over
fond
o
from
ambush
but
i
done
got
over
all
scruples
so
fur
ez
he
concerned
jest
one
bullet
one
little
bullet
henry
an
ef
i
miss
i
wo
ask
fur
a
second
sol
it
wo
do
said
henry
get
off
to
hunt
us
the
whole
fleet
would
be
stopped
and
we
want
to
go
on
as
fast
as
you
right
henry
said
the
shiftless
one
sadly
i
jest
like
to
try
it
once
i
give
a
month
good
huntin
for
that
single
after
watching
the
fleet
passing
up
the
river
they
turned
back
to
the
site
of
the
wyoming
fort
and
the
houses
near
it
here
everything
had
been
destroyed
it
was
about
dusk
when
they
approached
the
battlefield
and
they
heard
a
dreadful
howling
chiefly
that
of
wolves
think
we
better
turn
away
said
henry
could
do
anything
with
so
they
agreed
with
him
and
going
back
followed
the
indians
up
the
susquehanna
a
light
rain
fell
that
night
but
they
slept
under
a
little
shed
once
attached
to
a
house
which
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
in
some
way
the
shed
had
escaped
the
flames
and
it
now
came
into
timely
use
the
five
cunning
in
forest
practice
drew
up
brush
on
the
sides
and
timber
also
and
spreading
their
blankets
on
ashes
which
had
not
long
been
cold
lay
well
sheltered
from
the
drizzling
rain
although
they
did
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
it
was
the
hottest
period
of
the
year
in
america
but
the
night
had
come
on
cool
and
the
rain
made
it
cooler
the
five
profiting
by
experience
often
carried
with
them
two
light
blankets
instead
of
one
heavy
one
with
one
blanket
beneath
the
body
they
could
keep
warmer
in
case
the
weather
was
cold
now
they
lay
in
a
row
against
the
standing
wall
of
the
old
outhouse
protected
by
a
or
slant
of
board
roof
they
had
eaten
of
a
deer
that
they
had
shot
in
the
morning
and
they
had
a
sense
of
comfort
and
rest
that
none
of
them
had
known
before
in
many
days
henry
feelings
were
much
like
those
that
he
had
experienced
when
he
lay
in
the
bushes
in
the
little
canoe
wrapped
up
from
the
storm
and
hidden
from
the
iroquois
but
here
there
was
an
important
increase
of
pleasure
the
pattering
of
the
rain
on
the
board
roof
a
pleasant
soothing
sound
to
which
millions
of
boys
many
of
them
afterwards
great
men
have
listened
in
america
it
grew
very
dark
about
them
and
the
pleasant
patter
almost
musical
in
its
rhythm
kept
up
not
much
wind
was
blowing
and
it
too
was
melodious
henry
lay
with
his
head
on
a
little
heap
of
ashes
which
was
covered
by
his
under
blanket
and
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
brought
the
warning
to
wyoming
he
was
free
from
all
feeling
of
danger
the
picture
itself
of
the
battle
the
defeat
the
massacre
the
torture
and
of
the
savage
queen
esther
cleaving
the
heads
of
the
captives
was
at
times
as
vivid
as
ever
and
perhaps
would
always
return
now
and
then
in
its
original
true
colors
but
the
periods
between
when
youth
hope
and
strength
had
their
way
grew
longer
and
longer
now
henry
eyelids
sank
lower
and
lower
physical
comfort
and
the
presence
of
his
comrades
caused
a
deep
satisfaction
that
permeated
his
whole
being
the
light
wind
mingled
pleasantly
with
the
soft
summer
rain
the
sound
of
the
two
grew
strangely
melodious
almost
piercingly
sweet
and
then
it
seemed
to
be
human
they
sang
together
the
wind
and
rain
among
the
leaves
and
the
note
that
reached
his
heart
rather
than
his
ear
thrilled
him
with
courage
and
hope
once
more
the
invisible
voice
that
had
upborne
him
in
the
great
valley
of
the
ohio
told
him
even
here
in
the
ruined
valley
of
wyoming
that
what
was
lost
would
be
regained
the
chords
ended
and
the
echoes
amazingly
clear
floated
far
away
in
the
darkness
and
rain
henry
roused
himself
and
came
from
the
imaginative
borderland
he
stirred
a
little
and
said
in
a
quiet
voice
to
sol
you
hear
anything
sol
but
the
wind
an
the
henry
knew
that
such
would
be
the
answer
guess
you
did
hear
anything
either
henry
continued
the
shiftless
one
it
looked
to
me
that
you
wuz
ez
near
sleep
ez
a
feller
could
be
without
bein
ackshooally
was
drifting
away
said
henry
he
was
beginning
to
realize
that
he
had
a
great
power
or
rather
gift
paul
was
the
sensitive
imaginative
boy
seeing
everything
in
brilliant
colors
a
great
builder
of
castles
not
all
of
air
but
henry
gift
went
deeper
it
was
the
power
to
evoke
the
actual
living
picture
of
the
event
that
bad
not
yet
occurred
something
akin
in
its
nature
to
prophecy
based
perhaps
upon
the
wonderful
power
of
observation
inherited
doubtless
from
countless
primitive
ancestors
the
finest
product
of
the
wilderness
he
saw
in
that
wilderness
many
things
that
others
did
not
see
and
unconsciously
he
drew
his
conclusions
from
superior
knowledge
the
song
had
ceased
a
full
ten
minutes
and
then
came
another
note
a
howl
almost
plaintive
but
nevertheless
weird
and
full
of
ferocity
all
knew
it
at
once
they
had
heard
the
cry
of
wolves
too
often
in
their
lives
but
this
had
an
uncommon
note
like
the
yell
of
the
indian
in
victory
again
the
cry
arose
nearer
haunting
and
powerful
the
five
used
to
the
darkness
could
see
one
another
faces
and
the
look
that
all
gave
was
the
same
full
of
understanding
and
repulsion
has
been
a
great
day
for
the
wolf
in
this
valley
whispered
paul
striking
our
trail
they
think
they
are
going
to
find
what
they
have
been
finding
in
such
plenty
nodded
henry
do
you
remember
that
time
when
in
the
house
we
took
the
place
of
the
man
his
wife
and
children
just
before
the
indians
came
said
paul
treat
them
wolves
the
same
way
said
sol
glad
of
the
chance
said
long
jim
too
said
tom
ross
the
five
rose
up
to
sitting
positions
against
the
board
wall
and
everyone
held
across
his
knees
a
long
slender
barreled
rifle
with
the
muzzle
pointing
toward
the
forest
all
accomplished
marksmen
it
would
only
be
a
matter
of
a
moment
for
the
stock
to
leap
to
the
shoulder
the
eye
to
glance
down
the
barrel
the
finger
to
pull
the
trigger
and
the
unerring
bullet
to
leap
forth
you
give
the
word
as
usual
said
sol
henry
nodded
presently
in
the
darkness
they
heard
the
pattering
of
light
feet
and
they
saw
many
gleaming
eyes
draw
near
there
must
have
been
at
least
thirty
of
the
wolves
and
the
five
figures
that
they
saw
reclining
silent
and
motionless
against
the
unburned
portion
of
the
house
might
well
have
been
those
of
the
dead
and
scalped
whom
they
had
found
in
such
numbers
everywhere
they
drew
near
in
a
semicircular
group
its
concave
front
extended
toward
the
fire
the
greatest
wolves
at
the
center
despite
many
feastings
the
wolves
were
hungry
again
nothing
had
opposed
them
before
but
caution
was
instinctive
the
big
gray
leaders
did
not
mind
the
night
or
the
wind
or
the
rain
which
they
had
known
all
their
lives
and
which
they
counted
as
nothing
but
they
always
had
involuntary
suspicion
of
human
figures
whether
living
or
not
and
they
approached
slowly
wrinkling
back
their
noses
and
sniffing
the
wind
which
blew
from
them
instead
of
the
five
figures
but
their
confidence
increased
as
they
advanced
they
had
found
many
such
burned
houses
as
this
but
they
had
found
nothing
among
the
ruins
except
what
they
wished
the
big
leaders
advanced
more
boldly
glaring
straight
at
the
human
figures
a
slight
froth
on
their
lips
the
lips
themselves
curling
back
farther
from
the
strong
white
teeth
the
outer
ends
of
the
concave
semicircle
also
drew
in
the
whole
pack
was
about
to
spring
upon
its
unresisting
prey
and
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
many
a
wolfish
pulse
beat
a
little
higher
in
anticipation
with
a
suddenness
as
startling
figures
raised
themselves
five
long
dark
tubes
leaped
to
their
shoulders
and
with
a
suddenness
that
was
yet
more
terrifying
a
gush
of
flame
shot
from
five
muzzles
five
of
the
they
were
the
biggest
and
the
boldest
the
dead
upon
the
ashes
of
the
charred
timbers
and
the
others
howling
their
terror
to
the
dark
skies
fled
deep
into
the
forest
henry
strode
over
and
pushed
the
body
of
the
largest
wolf
with
his
foot
suppose
we
only
gratified
a
kind
of
sentiment
in
shooting
those
wolves
he
said
i
for
one
am
glad
we
did
am
i
said
paul
too
said
the
other
three
together
they
went
back
to
their
positions
near
the
wall
and
one
by
one
fell
asleep
no
more
wolves
howled
that
night
anywhere
near
them
when
the
five
awakened
the
next
morning
the
rain
had
ceased
and
a
splendid
sun
was
tinting
a
blue
sky
with
gold
jim
hart
built
a
fire
among
the
blackened
logs
and
cooked
venison
they
had
also
brought
from
fort
penn
a
little
coffee
which
long
jim
carried
with
a
small
coffee
pot
in
his
camp
kit
and
everyone
had
a
small
tin
cup
he
made
coffee
for
them
an
uncommon
wilderness
luxury
in
which
they
could
rarely
indulge
and
they
were
heartened
and
strengthened
by
it
then
they
went
again
up
the
valley
as
beautiful
as
ever
with
its
silver
river
in
the
center
and
its
green
mountain
walls
on
either
side
but
the
beauty
was
for
the
eye
only
it
did
not
reach
the
hearts
of
those
who
had
seen
it
before
all
of
the
five
loved
the
wilderness
but
they
felt
now
how
tragic
silence
and
desolation
could
be
where
human
life
and
all
the
daily
ways
of
human
life
had
been
it
was
but
the
wilderness
was
already
reclaiming
its
own
the
game
knew
that
man
was
gone
and
it
had
come
back
into
the
valley
deer
ate
what
had
grown
in
the
fields
and
gardens
and
the
wolves
were
everywhere
the
whole
black
tragedy
was
written
for
miles
they
were
never
out
of
sight
of
some
trace
of
it
and
their
anger
grew
again
as
they
advanced
in
the
blackened
path
of
the
victorious
indians
it
was
their
purpose
now
to
hang
on
the
indian
flank
as
scouts
and
skirmishers
until
an
american
army
was
formed
for
a
campaign
against
the
iroquois
which
they
were
sure
must
be
conducted
sooner
or
later
meanwhile
they
could
be
of
great
aid
gathering
news
of
the
indian
plans
and
when
that
army
of
which
they
dreamed
should
finally
march
they
could
help
it
most
of
all
by
warning
it
of
ambush
the
deadliest
weapon
everyone
of
the
five
had
already
perceived
a
fact
which
was
manifest
in
all
wars
with
the
indians
along
the
whole
border
from
north
to
south
as
it
steadily
shifted
farther
west
the
practical
hunter
and
scout
was
always
more
than
a
match
for
the
indian
man
for
man
but
when
the
raw
levies
of
settlers
were
hastily
gathered
to
stem
invasion
they
were
invariably
at
a
great
disadvantage
they
were
likely
to
be
caught
in
ambush
by
overwhelming
numbers
and
to
be
cut
down
as
had
just
happened
at
wyoming
the
same
fate
might
attend
an
invasion
of
the
iroquois
country
even
by
a
large
army
of
regular
troops
and
henry
and
his
comrades
resolved
upon
doing
their
utmost
to
prevent
it
an
army
needed
eyes
and
it
could
have
none
better
than
those
five
pairs
so
they
went
swiftly
up
the
valley
and
northward
and
eastward
into
the
country
of
the
iroquois
they
had
a
plan
of
approaching
the
upper
mohawk
village
of
canajoharie
where
one
account
says
that
thayendanegea
was
born
although
another
credits
his
birthplace
to
the
upper
banks
of
the
ohio
they
turned
now
from
the
valley
to
the
deep
woods
the
trail
showed
that
the
great
indian
force
after
disembarking
again
split
into
large
parties
everyone
loaded
with
spoil
and
bound
for
its
home
village
the
five
noted
several
of
the
trails
but
one
of
them
consumed
the
whole
attention
of
silent
tom
ross
he
saw
in
the
soft
soil
near
a
creek
bank
the
footsteps
of
about
eight
indians
and
mingled
with
them
other
footsteps
which
he
took
to
be
those
of
a
white
woman
and
of
several
children
captives
as
even
a
tyro
would
infer
the
soul
of
tom
the
good
honest
and
inarticulate
frontiersman
stirred
within
him
a
white
woman
and
her
children
being
carried
off
to
savagery
to
be
lost
forevermore
to
their
kind
tom
still
inarticulate
felt
his
heart
pierced
with
sadness
at
the
tale
that
the
tracks
in
the
soft
mud
told
so
plainly
but
despair
was
not
the
only
emotion
in
his
heart
the
silent
and
brave
man
meant
to
act
he
said
these
tracks
here
in
the
soft
spot
by
the
the
young
leader
read
the
forest
page
and
it
told
him
exactly
the
same
tale
that
it
had
told
tom
ross
a
day
old
i
think
he
said
about
said
tom
i
reckon
henry
you
know
what
in
my
think
i
do
said
henry
we
ought
to
overtake
them
by
night
you
tell
the
others
tom
informed
sol
paul
and
long
jim
in
a
few
words
receiving
from
everyone
a
glad
assent
and
then
the
five
followed
fast
on
the
trail
they
knew
that
the
indians
could
not
go
very
fast
as
their
speed
must
be
that
of
the
slowest
namely
that
of
the
children
and
it
seemed
likely
that
henry
prediction
of
overtaking
them
on
the
following
night
would
come
true
it
was
an
easy
trail
here
and
there
were
tiny
fragments
of
cloth
caught
by
a
bush
from
the
dress
of
a
captive
in
one
place
they
saw
a
fragment
of
a
child
shoe
that
had
been
dropped
off
and
abandoned
paul
picked
up
the
worn
piece
of
leather
and
examined
it
think
it
was
worn
by
a
girl
he
said
judging
from
its
size
she
could
not
have
been
more
than
eight
years
old
think
of
a
child
like
that
being
made
to
walk
five
or
six
hundred
miles
through
these
woods
ones
still
have
had
to
do
it
said
sol
gravely
them
that
the
the
trail
was
leading
them
toward
the
seneca
country
and
they
had
no
doubt
that
the
indians
were
senecas
who
had
been
more
numerous
than
any
others
of
the
six
nations
at
the
wyoming
battle
they
came
that
afternoon
to
a
camp
fire
beside
which
the
warriors
and
captives
had
slept
the
night
before
ate
bar
meat
an
wild
turkey
said
long
jim
looking
at
some
bones
on
the
ground
here
said
tom
ross
this
pile
uv
bushes
is
whar
the
women
children
slept
an
on
the
other
side
uv
the
fire
is
whar
the
warriors
lay
anywhars
you
can
still
see
how
the
bodies
uv
some
uv
crushed
down
the
grass
an
little
i
thinkin
said
sol
as
he
looked
at
the
trail
that
led
away
from
the
camp
fire
some
o
them
little
ones
wuz
tired
look
how
these
here
little
trails
are
wobblin
we
kin
come
up
afore
the
injuns
begin
to
draw
thar
tomahawks
said
tom
ross
the
others
were
silent
but
they
knew
the
dreadful
significance
of
remark
and
henry
glanced
at
them
all
one
by
one
the
greatest
danger
to
be
feared
he
said
we
must
overtake
them
in
the
night
when
they
are
not
suspecting
if
we
attack
by
day
they
will
tomahawk
the
captives
the
very
first
said
the
shiftless
one
said
henry
do
need
to
hurry
we
go
on
until
about
midnight
and
then
sleep
until
they
continued
at
a
fair
pace
along
a
trail
that
frontiersmen
far
less
skillful
than
they
could
have
followed
but
a
silent
dread
was
in
the
heart
of
every
one
of
them
as
they
saw
the
path
of
the
small
feet
staggering
more
and
more
they
feared
to
behold
some
terrible
object
beside
the
path
trail
of
the
littlest
child
is
gone
suddenly
announced
paul
said
henry
the
mother
has
picked
it
up
and
is
carrying
it
see
how
her
trail
has
suddenly
grown
more
woman
said
paul
we
just
bound
to
overtake
that
do
it
said
henry
at
the
appointed
time
they
sank
down
among
the
thickest
bushes
that
they
could
find
and
slept
until
the
first
upshot
of
dawn
then
they
resumed
the
trail
haunted
always
by
that
fear
of
finding
something
terrible
beside
it
but
it
was
a
trail
that
continually
grew
slower
the
indians
themselves
were
tired
or
feeling
safe
from
pursuit
saw
no
need
of
hurry
by
and
by
the
trail
of
the
smallest
child
reappeared
feels
a
lot
better
now
said
tom
ross
do
they
came
to
another
camp
fire
at
which
the
ashes
were
not
yet
cold
feathers
were
scattered
about
indicating
that
the
indians
had
taken
time
for
a
little
side
hunt
and
had
shot
some
birds
ca
be
more
than
two
or
three
hours
ahead
said
henry
we
have
to
go
on
now
very
they
were
in
a
country
of
high
hills
well
covered
with
forests
a
region
suited
to
an
ambush
which
they
feared
but
little
on
their
own
account
but
for
the
sake
of
extreme
caution
they
now
advanced
slowly
the
afternoon
was
long
and
warm
but
an
hour
before
sunset
they
looked
over
a
hill
into
a
glade
and
saw
the
warriors
making
camp
for
the
night
the
sight
they
beheld
made
the
pulses
of
the
five
throb
heavily
the
indians
had
already
built
their
fire
and
two
of
them
were
cooking
venison
upon
it
others
were
lying
on
the
grass
apparently
resting
but
a
little
to
one
side
sat
a
woman
still
young
and
of
large
strong
figure
though
now
apparently
in
the
last
stages
of
exhaustion
with
her
feet
showing
through
the
fragments
of
shoes
that
she
wore
her
head
was
bare
and
her
dress
was
in
strips
four
children
lay
beside
her
the
youngest
two
with
their
heads
in
her
lap
the
other
two
who
might
be
eleven
and
thirteen
each
had
pillowed
their
heads
on
their
arms
and
lay
in
the
dull
apathy
that
comes
from
the
finish
of
both
strength
and
hope
the
woman
face
was
pitiful
she
had
more
to
fear
than
the
children
and
she
knew
it
she
was
so
worn
that
the
skin
hung
loosely
on
her
face
and
her
eyes
showed
despair
only
the
sad
spectacle
was
almost
more
than
paul
could
stand
do
like
to
shoot
from
ambush
he
said
we
could
cut
down
half
of
those
warriors
at
our
firs
fire
and
rush
in
on
the
those
we
did
cut
down
at
our
first
volley
would
tomahawk
the
woman
and
children
in
an
instant
replied
henry
agreed
you
know
that
it
would
be
sure
to
happen
we
ca
do
anything
until
night
comes
and
then
we
got
to
be
mighty
paul
could
not
dispute
the
truth
of
his
words
and
they
withdrew
carefully
to
the
crest
of
a
hill
where
they
lay
in
the
undergrowth
watching
the
indians
complete
their
fire
and
their
preparations
for
the
night
it
was
evident
to
henry
that
they
considered
themselves
perfectly
safe
certainly
they
had
every
reason
for
thinking
so
it
was
not
likely
that
white
enemies
were
within
a
hundred
miles
of
them
and
if
so
it
could
only
be
a
wandering
hunter
or
two
who
would
flee
from
this
fierce
band
of
senecas
who
bad
taken
revenge
for
the
great
losses
that
had
suffered
the
year
before
at
the
oriskany
they
kept
very
little
watch
and
built
only
a
small
fire
just
enough
for
broiling
deer
meat
which
they
carried
they
drank
at
a
little
spring
which
ran
from
under
a
ledge
near
them
and
gave
portions
of
the
meat
to
the
woman
and
children
after
the
woman
had
eaten
they
bound
her
hands
and
she
lay
back
on
the
grass
about
twenty
feet
from
the
camp
fire
two
children
lay
on
either
side
of
her
and
they
were
soon
sound
asleep
the
warriors
as
indians
will
do
when
they
are
free
from
danger
and
care
talked
a
good
deal
and
showed
all
the
signs
of
having
what
was
to
them
a
luxurious
time
they
ate
plentifully
lolled
on
the
grass
and
looked
at
some
hideous
trophies
the
scalps
that
they
carried
at
their
belts
the
woman
could
not
keep
from
seeing
these
too
but
her
face
did
not
change
from
its
stony
aspect
of
despair
then
the
light
of
the
fire
went
out
the
sun
sank
behind
the
mountains
and
the
five
could
no
longer
see
the
little
group
of
captives
and
captors
they
still
waited
although
eagerness
and
impatience
were
tugging
at
the
hearts
of
every
one
of
them
but
they
must
give
the
indians
time
to
fall
asleep
if
they
would
secure
rescue
and
not
merely
revenge
they
remained
in
the
bushes
saying
but
little
and
eating
of
venison
that
they
carried
in
their
knapsacks
they
let
a
full
three
hours
pass
and
the
night
remained
dark
but
with
a
faint
moon
showing
then
they
descended
slowly
into
the
valley
approaching
by
cautious
degrees
the
spot
where
they
knew
the
indian
camp
lay
this
work
required
at
least
three
quarters
of
an
hour
and
they
reached
a
point
where
they
could
see
the
embers
of
the
fire
and
the
dark
figures
lying
about
it
the
indians
their
suspicions
lulled
had
put
out
no
sentinels
and
all
were
asleep
but
the
five
knew
that
at
the
first
shot
they
would
be
as
wide
awake
as
if
they
had
never
slept
and
as
formidable
as
tigers
their
problem
seemed
as
great
as
ever
so
they
lay
in
the
bushes
and
held
a
whispered
conference
this
said
henry
want
to
save
the
woman
and
the
children
from
the
tomahawks
and
to
do
so
we
must
get
them
out
of
range
of
the
blade
before
the
battle
said
tom
ross
got
to
slip
up
release
the
woman
arm
her
tell
her
to
run
for
the
woods
with
the
children
and
then
you
four
must
do
the
most
of
the
you
think
you
can
do
it
henry
asked
sol
can
as
i
will
soon
show
you
i
going
to
steal
forward
to
the
woman
but
the
moment
you
four
hear
an
alarm
open
with
your
rifles
and
pistols
you
can
come
a
little
nearer
without
being
all
of
them
moved
up
close
to
the
indian
camp
and
lay
hidden
in
the
last
fringe
of
bushes
except
henry
he
lay
almost
flat
upon
the
ground
carrying
his
rifle
parallel
with
his
side
and
in
his
right
hand
he
was
undertaking
one
of
the
severest
and
most
dangerous
tests
known
to
a
frontiersman
he
meant
to
crawl
into
the
very
midst
of
a
camp
of
the
iroquois
composed
of
the
most
alert
woodsmen
in
the
world
men
who
would
spring
up
at
the
slightest
crackle
in
the
brush
woodmen
who
warned
by
some
sixth
sense
would
awaken
at
the
mere
fact
of
a
strange
presence
the
four
who
remained
behind
in
the
bushes
could
not
keep
their
hearts
from
beating
louder
and
faster
they
knew
the
tremendous
risk
undertaken
by
their
comrade
but
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
would
have
shirked
it
had
not
all
yielded
it
to
the
one
whom
they
knew
to
be
the
best
fitted
for
the
task
henry
crept
forward
silently
bringing
to
his
aid
all
the
years
of
skill
that
he
had
acquired
in
his
life
in
the
wilds
his
body
was
like
that
of
a
serpent
going
forward
coil
by
coil
he
was
near
enough
now
to
see
the
embers
of
the
fire
not
yet
quite
dead
the
dark
figures
scattered
about
it
sleeping
upon
the
grass
with
the
long
ease
of
custom
and
then
the
outline
of
the
woman
apart
from
the
others
with
the
children
about
her
henry
now
lay
entirely
flat
and
his
motions
were
genuinely
those
of
a
serpent
it
was
by
a
sort
of
contraction
and
relaxation
of
the
body
that
he
moved
himself
and
his
progress
was
absolutely
soundless
the
object
of
his
advance
was
the
woman
he
saw
by
the
faint
light
of
the
moon
that
she
was
not
yet
asleep
her
face
worn
and
weather
beaten
was
upturned
to
the
skies
and
the
stony
look
of
despair
seemed
to
have
settled
there
forever
she
lay
upon
some
pine
boughs
and
her
hands
were
tied
behind
her
for
the
night
with
deerskin
henry
contorted
himself
on
inch
by
inch
for
all
the
world
like
a
great
snake
now
he
passed
the
sleeping
senecas
hideous
with
war
paint
and
came
closer
to
the
woman
she
was
not
paying
attention
to
anything
about
her
but
was
merely
looking
up
at
the
pale
cold
stars
as
if
everything
in
the
world
had
ceased
for
her
henry
crept
a
little
nearer
he
made
a
slight
noise
as
of
a
lizard
running
through
the
grass
but
the
woman
took
no
notice
he
crept
closer
and
there
he
lay
flat
upon
the
grass
within
six
feet
of
her
his
figure
merely
a
slightly
darker
blur
against
the
dark
blur
of
the
earth
then
trusting
to
the
woman
courage
and
strength
of
mind
he
emitted
a
hiss
very
soft
and
low
like
the
warning
of
a
serpent
half
in
fear
and
half
in
anger
the
woman
moved
a
little
and
looked
toward
the
point
from
which
the
sound
had
come
it
might
have
been
the
formidable
hiss
of
a
coiling
rattlesnake
that
she
heard
but
she
felt
no
fear
she
was
too
much
stunned
too
near
exhaustion
to
be
alarmed
by
anything
and
she
did
not
look
a
second
time
she
merely
settled
back
on
the
pine
boughs
and
again
looked
dully
up
at
the
pale
cold
stars
that
cared
so
little
for
her
or
hers
henry
crept
another
yard
nearer
and
then
he
uttered
that
low
noise
sibilant
and
warning
which
the
woman
the
product
of
the
border
knew
to
be
made
by
a
human
being
she
raised
herself
a
little
although
it
was
difficult
with
her
bound
hands
to
sit
upright
and
saw
a
dark
shadow
approaching
her
that
dark
shadow
she
knew
to
be
the
figure
of
a
man
an
indian
would
not
be
approaching
in
such
a
manner
and
she
looked
again
startled
into
a
sudden
acute
attention
and
into
a
belief
that
the
incredible
the
impossible
was
about
to
happen
a
voice
came
from
the
figure
and
its
quality
was
that
of
the
white
voice
not
the
red
not
move
said
that
incredible
voice
out
of
the
unknown
have
come
for
your
rescue
and
others
who
have
come
for
the
same
purpose
are
near
turn
on
one
side
and
i
will
cut
the
bonds
that
hold
your
the
voice
the
white
voice
was
like
the
touch
of
fire
to
mary
newton
a
sudden
fierce
desire
for
life
and
for
the
lives
of
her
four
children
awoke
within
her
just
when
hope
had
gone
the
call
to
life
came
she
had
never
heard
before
a
voice
so
full
of
cheer
and
encouragement
it
penetrated
her
whole
being
exhaustion
and
despair
fled
away
a
little
on
your
side
said
the
voice
she
turned
obediently
and
then
felt
the
sharp
edge
of
cold
steel
as
it
swept
between
her
wrists
and
cut
the
thongs
that
held
them
together
her
arms
fell
apart
and
strength
permeated
every
vein
of
her
being
shall
attack
in
a
few
moments
said
the
voice
at
the
first
shots
the
senecas
will
try
to
tomahawk
you
and
your
children
hold
out
your
she
held
out
both
hands
obediently
the
handle
of
a
tomahawk
was
pressed
into
one
and
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
into
the
other
strength
flowed
down
each
hand
into
her
body
the
time
comes
use
them
you
are
strong
and
you
know
how
said
the
voice
then
she
saw
the
dark
figure
creeping
away
chapter
xiv
the
pursuit
on
the
river
the
story
of
the
frontier
is
filled
with
heroines
from
the
far
days
of
hannah
dustin
down
to
the
present
and
mary
newton
whom
the
unknown
figure
in
the
dark
had
just
aroused
is
one
of
them
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
god
himself
had
deserted
her
but
at
the
last
moment
he
had
sent
some
one
she
did
not
doubt
she
could
not
doubt
because
the
bonds
had
been
severed
and
there
she
lay
with
a
deadly
weapon
in
either
hand
the
friendly
stranger
who
had
come
so
silently
was
gone
as
he
had
come
but
she
was
not
helpless
now
like
many
another
frontier
woman
she
was
naturally
lithe
and
powerful
and
stirred
by
a
great
hope
all
her
strength
had
returned
for
the
present
nobody
who
lives
in
the
wilderness
can
wholly
escape
superstition
and
mary
newton
began
to
believe
that
some
supernatural
creature
had
intervened
in
her
behalf
she
raised
herself
just
a
little
on
one
elbow
and
surveyed
the
surrounding
thicket
she
saw
only
the
dead
embers
of
the
fire
and
the
dark
forms
of
the
indians
lying
upon
the
bare
ground
had
it
not
been
for
the
knife
and
pistol
in
her
hand
she
could
have
believed
that
the
voice
was
only
a
dream
there
was
a
slight
rustling
in
the
thicket
and
a
seneca
rose
quickly
to
his
knees
grasping
his
rifle
in
both
hands
the
woman
fingers
clutched
the
knife
and
pistol
more
tightly
and
her
whole
gaunt
figure
trembled
the
seneca
listened
only
a
moment
then
he
gave
a
sharp
cry
and
all
the
other
warriors
sprang
up
but
three
of
them
rose
only
to
fall
again
as
the
rifles
cracked
in
the
bushes
while
two
others
staggered
from
wounds
the
triumphant
shout
of
the
frontiersmen
came
from
the
thicket
and
then
they
rushed
upon
the
camp
quick
as
a
flash
two
of
the
senecas
started
toward
the
woman
and
children
with
their
tomahawks
but
mary
newton
was
ready
her
heart
had
leaped
at
the
shots
when
the
senecas
fell
and
she
kept
her
courage
now
she
sprang
to
her
full
height
and
with
the
children
screaming
at
her
feet
fired
one
barrel
of
the
pistol
directly
into
the
face
of
the
first
warrior
and
served
the
second
in
the
same
way
with
the
other
barrel
when
he
was
less
than
four
feet
away
then
tomahawk
in
hand
she
rushed
forward
in
judging
mary
newton
one
must
consider
time
and
place
but
happily
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
use
her
tomahawk
as
the
five
rushed
in
four
of
them
emptied
their
pistols
while
henry
swung
his
clubbed
rifle
with
terrible
effect
it
was
too
much
for
the
senecas
the
apparition
of
the
armed
woman
whom
they
had
left
bound
and
the
deadly
fire
from
the
five
figures
that
sprang
upon
them
was
like
a
blow
from
the
hand
of
aieroski
the
unhurt
and
wounded
fled
deep
into
the
forest
leaving
their
dead
behind
mary
newton
her
great
deed
done
collapsed
from
emotion
and
weakness
the
screams
of
the
children
sank
in
a
few
moments
to
frightened
whimpers
but
the
oldest
when
they
saw
the
white
faces
knew
that
rescue
had
come
paul
brought
water
from
the
brook
in
his
cap
and
mary
newton
was
revived
jim
was
reassuring
the
children
and
the
other
three
were
in
the
thickets
watching
lest
the
surviving
senecas
return
for
attack
do
know
who
you
are
but
i
think
the
good
god
himself
must
have
sent
you
to
our
rescue
said
mary
newton
reverently
do
know
said
paul
we
are
doing
the
best
we
can
do
you
think
you
can
walk
now
from
the
savages
yes
she
said
passionately
she
looked
down
at
the
dead
figures
of
the
senecas
and
she
did
not
feel
a
single
trace
of
pity
for
them
again
it
is
necessary
to
consider
time
and
place
of
my
strength
came
back
while
i
was
lying
here
she
said
much
more
of
it
when
you
drove
away
the
well
said
henry
who
had
returned
to
the
dead
camp
fire
with
his
comrades
must
start
on
the
back
trail
at
once
the
surviving
senecas
joined
by
other
iroquois
will
certainly
pursue
and
we
need
all
the
start
that
we
can
long
jim
picked
up
one
of
the
two
younger
children
and
flung
him
over
his
shoulder
tom
ross
did
as
much
for
the
other
but
the
older
two
scorned
help
they
were
full
of
admiration
for
the
great
woodsmen
mighty
heroes
who
had
suddenly
appeared
out
of
the
air
as
it
were
and
who
had
swept
like
a
tornado
over
the
seneca
band
it
did
not
seem
possible
now
that
they
could
be
retaken
but
mary
newton
with
her
strength
and
courage
had
also
recovered
her
forethought
it
will
not
be
better
to
go
on
the
back
trail
she
said
of
the
senecas
told
me
that
six
or
seven
miles
farther
on
was
a
river
flowing
into
the
susquehanna
and
that
they
would
cross
this
river
on
a
boat
now
concealed
among
bushes
on
the
bank
the
crossing
was
at
a
sudden
drop
between
high
banks
might
not
we
go
on
find
the
boat
and
come
back
in
it
down
the
river
and
into
the
susquehanna
sounds
mighty
close
to
wisdom
to
me
said
sol
it
likely
to
have
the
advantage
o
throwin
the
iroquois
off
our
track
they
think
o
course
that
we
gone
straight
back
we
pass
ez
we
going
certainly
the
best
plan
said
henry
it
worth
our
while
to
try
for
that
hidden
boat
of
the
iroquois
do
you
know
the
general
direction
due
we
make
a
curve
to
the
right
in
order
to
avoid
any
iroquois
who
may
be
returning
to
this
camp
and
push
for
henry
led
the
way
over
hilly
rough
ground
and
the
others
followed
in
a
silent
file
long
jim
and
tom
still
carrying
the
two
smallest
children
who
soon
fell
asleep
on
their
shoulders
henry
did
not
believe
that
the
returning
iroquois
could
follow
their
trail
on
such
a
dark
night
and
the
others
agreed
with
him
after
a
while
they
saw
the
gleam
of
water
henry
knew
that
it
must
be
very
near
or
it
would
have
been
wholly
invisible
on
such
a
dark
night
think
newton
he
said
this
is
the
river
of
which
you
spoke
and
the
cliffs
seem
to
drop
down
just
as
you
said
they
the
woman
smiled
she
said
done
well
with
my
poor
guess
and
the
boat
must
be
hidden
somewhere
near
then
she
sank
down
with
exhaustion
and
the
two
older
children
unable
to
walk
farther
sank
down
beside
her
but
the
two
who
slept
soundly
on
the
shoulders
of
long
jim
and
tom
ross
did
not
awaken
henry
motioned
to
jim
and
tom
to
remain
there

quizzical
and
approving

with
them
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
discovered
deep
among
bushes
growing
in
the
shallow
water
a
large
boat
with
two
pairs
of
oars
and
with
small
supplies
of
parched
corn
and
venison
hidden
in

clear
water
said
henry
you
can
go
back
and
tell
the
others
just
suits
a
lazy
man
said
sol
and
he
walked
away
jauntily
under
his
apparent
frivolity
he
concealed
his
joy
at
the
find
which
he
knew
to
be
of
such
vast
importance
he
approached
the
dusky
group
and
his
really
tender
heart
was
stirred
with
pity
for
the
rescued
captives
long
jim
and
silent
tom
held
the
smaller
two
on
their
shoulders
but
the
older
ones
and
the
woman
also
had
fallen
asleep
sol
in
order
to
conceal
his
emotion
strode
up
rather
roughly
mary
newton
awoke

at

for

in
a
golden
barge
settin
on

i
admit
it
strange
to
me
too
but
who
are
you
an
me
jim
hart
to
question
the
ways
of
foreign
countries
thousands
o
miles
on
the
other
side
o
the
sea
found
the
boat
said
tom
ross
that
enough
it
really
true
asked
newton
is
replied
sol
henry
an
paul
are
in
it
fur
us
we
thinkin
newton
that
the
roughest
part
of
your
trip
is
in
another
five
minutes
all
were
in
the
boat
which
was
a
really
fine
one
and
they
were
delighted
mary
newton
for
the
first
time
broke
down
and
wept
and
no
one
disturbed
her
the
five
spread
the
blankets
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
where
the
children
soon
went
to
sleep
once
more
and
tom
ross
and
sol
took
the
oars
in
a
boat
said
the
shiftless
one
exultantly
me
feel
like
old
times
my
mode
o
travelin
when
jim
hart
o
me
is
at
the
is
most
o
the
time
said
long
jim
it
was
indeed
a
wonderful
change
to
these
people
worn
by
the
wilderness
they
lay
at
ease
now
while
two
pairs
of
powerful
arms
with
scarcely
an
effort
propelled
the
boat
along
the
stream
the
woman
herself
lay
down
on
the
blankets
and
fell
asleep
with
the
children
henry
at
the
prow
tom
ross
at
the
stern
and
paul
amidships
watched
in
silence
but
with
their
rifles
across
their
knees
they
knew
that
the
danger
was
far
from
over
other
indians
were
likely
to
use
this
stream
unknown
to
them
as
a
highway
and
those
who
survived
of
their
original
captors
could
pick
up
their
trail
by
daylight
and
the
senecas
being
mad
for
revenge
would
surely
get
help
and
follow
henry
believed
that
the
theory
of
returning
toward
the
wyoming
valley
was
sound
that
region
had
been
so
thoroughly
ravaged
now
that
all
the
indians
would
be
going
northward
if
they
could
float
down
a
day
or
so
without
molestation
they
would
probably
be
safe
the
creek
or
rather
little
river
broadened
flowing
with
a
smooth
fairly
swift
current
the
forest
on
either
side
was
dense
with
oak
hickory
maple
and
other
splendid
trees
often
with
a
growth
of
underbrush
the
three
riflemen
never
ceased
to
watch
intently
henry
always
looked
ahead
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
any
ambushed
marksman
to
have
escaped
his
notice
but
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
them
once
a
deer
came
down
to
drink
and
fled
away
at
sight
of
the
phantom
boat
gliding
almost
without
noise
on
the
still
waters
once
the
far
scream
of
a
panther
came
from
the
woods
but
mary
newton
and
her
children
sleeping
soundly
did
not
hear
it
the
five
themselves
knew
the
nature
of
the
sound
and
paid
no
attention
the
boat
went
steadily
on
the
three
riflemen
never
changing
their
position
and
soon
the
day
began
to
come
little
arrows
of
golden
light
pierced
through
the
foliage
of
the
trees
and
sparkled
on
the
surface
of
the
water
in
the
cast
the
red
sun
was
coming
from
his
nightly
trip
henry
looked
down
at
the
sleepers
they
were
overpowered
by
exhaustion
and
would
not
awake
of
their
own
accord
for
a
long
time
sol
caught
his
look
not
let
sleep
on
he
said
then
he
and
jim
hart
took
the
oars
and
the
shiftless
one
and
tom
ross
resumed
their
rifles
the
day
was
coming
fast
and
the
whole
forest
was
soon
transfused
with
light
no
one
of
the
five
had
slept
during
the
night
they
did
not
feel
the
need
of
sleep
and
they
were
upborne
too
by
a
great
exaltation
they
had
saved
the
prisoners
thus
far
from
a
horrible
fate
and
they
were
firmly
resolved
to
reach
with
them
some
strong
settlement
and
safety
they
felt
too
a
sense
of
exultation
over
brant
sangerachte
hiokatoo
the
butlers
the
johnsons
wyatt
and
all
the
crew
that
had
committed
such
terrible
devastation
in
the
wyoming
valley
and
elsewhere
the
full
day
clothed
the
earth
in
a
light
that
turned
from
silver
to
gold
and
the
woman
and
the
children
still
slept
the
five
chewed
some
strips
of
venison
and
looked
rather
lugubriously
at
the
pieces
they
were
saving
for
mary
newton
and
the
children
ought
to
hev
more
that
said
sol
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
we
got
to
land
somewhar
an
shoot
a
not
yet
said
henry
in
a
whisper
lest
he
wake
the
sleepers
think
we
come
into
the
susquehanna
pretty
soon
and
its
width
will
be
a
good
thing
for
us
i
wish
we
were
there
now
i
do
like
this
narrow
stream
its
narrowness
affords
too
good
an
the
creek
is
broadenin
out
fast
said
the
shiftless
one
that
is
a
good
sign
what
that
you
see
ahead
henry
ai
it
a
river
surely
is
replied
henry
who
caught
sight
of
a
broad
expanse
of
water
it
the
susquehanna
pull
hard
sol
in
five
more
minutes
we
be
in
the
it
was
less
than
five
when
they
turned
into
the
current
of
the
susquehanna
and
less
than
five
more
when
they
heard
a
shout
behind
them
and
saw
at
least
a
dozen
canoes
following
the
canoes
were
filled
with
indians
and
tories
and
they
had
spied
the
fugitives
the
women
and
the
children
down
paul
cried
henry
all
knew
that
henry
and
sol
were
the
best
shots
and
without
a
word
long
jim
and
tom
both
powerful
and
skilled
watermen
swung
heavily
on
the
oars
while
henry
and
sol
sat
in
the
rear
with
their
rifles
ready
mary
newton
awoke
with
a
cry
at
the
sound
of
the
shots
and
started
to
rise
but
paul
pushed
her
down
on
the
susquehanna
now
newton
he
said
we
are
pursued
the
indians
and
tories
have
just
seen
us
but
do
be
afraid
the
two
who
are
watching
there
are
the
best
shots
in
the
he
looked
significantly
at
henry
and
sol
crouching
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
like
great
warriors
from
some
mighty
past
kings
of
the
forest
whom
no
one
could
overcome
and
her
courage
came
back
the
children
too
had
awakened
with
frightened
cries
but
she
and
paul
quickly
soothed
them
and
obedient
to
commands
the
four
and
mary
newton
with
them
lay
flat
upon
the
bottom
of
the
boat
which
was
now
being
sent
forward
rapidly
by
jim
hart
and
tom
paul
took
up
his
rifle
and
sat
in
a
waiting
attitude
either
to
relieve
one
of
the
men
at
the
oars
or
to
shoot
if
necessary
the
clear
sun
made
forest
and
river
vivid
in
its
light
the
indians
after
their
first
cry
made
no
sound
but
so
powerful
were
long
jim
and
tom
that
they
were
gaining
but
little
although
some
of
the
boats
contained
six
or
eight
rowers
as
the
light
grew
more
intense
henry
made
out
the
two
white
faces
in
the
first
boat
one
was
that
of
braxton
wyatt
and
the
other
he
was
quite
sure
belonged
to
the
infamous
walter
butler
hot
anger
swept
through
all
his
veins
and
the
little
pulses
in
his
temples
began
to
beat
like
trip
hammers
now
the
picture
of
wyoming
the
battle
the
massacre
the
torture
and
queen
esther
wielding
her
great
tomahawk
on
the
bound
captives
grew
astonishingly
vivid
and
it
was
printed
blood
red
on
his
brain
the
spirit
of
anger
and
defiance
of
a
desire
to
taunt
those
who
had
done
such
things
leaped
up
in
his
heart
you
there
braxton
wyatt
he
called
clearly
across
the
intervening
water
i
see
that
it
is
you
murderer
of
women
and
children
champion
of
the
fire
and
stake
as
savage
as
any
of
the
savages
and
it
is
you
too
walter
butler
wickeder
son
of
a
wicked
father
come
a
little
closer
wo
you
we
messengers
here
for
both
of
you
he
tapped
lightly
the
barrel
of
his
own
rifle
and
that
of
sol
and
repeated
his
request
that
they
come
a
little
closer
they
understood
his
words
and
they
understood
also
the
significant
gesture
when
he
patted
the
barrel
of
the
rifles
the
hearts
of
both
butler
and
wyatt
were
for
the
moment
afraid
and
their
boat
dropped
back
to
third
place
henry
laughed
aloud
when
he
saw
the
viking
rage
was
still
upon
him
this
was
the
primeval
wilderness
and
these
were
no
common
foes
see
that
you
do
want
to
receive
our
little
messengers
he
cried
have
you
dropped
back
to
third
place
in
the
line
braxton
wyatt
and
walter
butler
when
you
were
first
only
a
moment
ago
are
you
cowards
as
well
as
murderers
of
women
and
children
good
talk
said
sol
admiringly
you
a
real
orator
give
it
to
an
mebbe
i
get
a
chance
at
one
o
them
it
seemed
that
henry
words
had
an
effect
because
the
boat
of
the
renegades
pulled
up
somewhat
although
it
did
not
regain
first
place
thus
the
chase
proceeded
down
the
susquehanna
the
indian
fleet
was
gaining
a
little
and
sol
called
attention
to
it
you
think
i
better
take
a
shot
at
one
o
them
rowers
in
the
first
boat
he
said
to
henry
an
butler
are
a
leetle
too
fur
think
it
would
give
them
a
good
hint
sol
said
henry
that
fellow
on
the
right
who
is
pulling
so
the
shiftless
one
raised
his
rifle
lingered
but
a
little
over
his
aim
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
rower
whom
henry
had
pointed
out
fell
back
in
the
boat
his
hands
slipping
from
the
handles
of
his
oars
the
boat
was
thrown
into
confusion
and
dropped
back
in
the
race
scattering
shots
were
fired
in
return
but
all
fell
short
the
water
spurting
up
in
little
jets
where
they
struck
henry
who
had
caught
something
of
the
indian
nature
in
his
long
stay
among
them
in
the
northwest
laughed
in
loud
irony
was
one
of
our
little
messengers
and
it
found
a
listener
he
shouted
i
see
that
you
are
afraid
braxton
wyatt
and
walter
butler
murderers
of
women
and
children
why
do
you
keep
your
proper
places
in
the
front
the
way
to
talk
to
whispered
sol
as
he
reloaded
it
up
an
mebbe
we
kin
git
a
chance
at
braxton
wyatt
hisself
since
wyoming
i
never
think
o
missin
sech
a
i
either
said
henry
and
he
resumed
in
his
powerful
tones
place
of
a
leader
is
in
front
is
it
then
why
do
you
come
up
braxton
wyatt
and
walter
butler
did
not
come
up
they
were
not
lacking
in
courage
but
wyatt
knew
what
deadly
marksmen
the
fugitive
boat
contained
and
he
had
also
told
butler
so
they
still
hung
back
although
they
raged
at
henry
ware
taunts
and
permitted
the
mohawks
and
senecas
to
take
the
lead
in
the
chase
not
going
to
give
us
a
chance
said
henry
satisfied
of
that
they
let
redskins
receive
our
bullets
though
just
now
i
rather
it
were
the
two
white
ones
what
do
you
think
sol
of
that
leading
boat
should
we
give
another
hint
agree
with
you
henry
said
the
shiftless
one
much
too
close
fur
people
that
ai
properly
interduced
to
us
this
promiskus
way
o
meetin
up
with
strangers
an
lettin
talk
to
you
jest
ez
ef
they
knowed
you
all
their
lives
hez
got
to
be
stopped
your
time
henry
to
give
a
polite
hint
an
i
jest
suggest
that
you
take
the
big
fellow
in
the
front
o
the
boat
who
looks
like
a
henry
raised
his
rifle
fired
and
the
mohawk
would
row
no
more
again
confusion
prevailed
in
the
pursuing
fleet
and
there
was
a
decline
of
enthusiasm
braxton
wyatt
and
walter
butler
raged
and
swore
but
as
they
showed
no
great
zeal
for
the
lead
themselves
the
iroquois
did
not
gain
on
the
fugitive
boat
they
too
were
fast
learning
that
the
two
who
crouched
there
with
their
rifles
ready
were
among
the
deadliest
marksmen
in
existence
they
fired
a
dozen
shots
perhaps
but
their
rifles
did
not
have
the
long
range
of
the
kentucky
weapons
and
again
the
bullets
fell
short
causing
little
jets
of
water
to
spring
up
wo
come
any
nearer
at
least
not
for
the
present
said
henry
will
hang
back
just
out
of
rifle
range
waiting
for
some
chance
to
help
sol
looked
the
other
way
down
the
susquehanna
and
announced
that
he
could
see
no
danger
there
was
probably
no
indian
fleet
farther
down
the
river
than
the
one
now
pursuing
them
and
the
danger
was
behind
them
not
before
throughout
the
firing
silent
tom
ross
and
long
jim
hart
had
not
said
a
word
but
they
rowed
with
a
steadiness
and
power
that
would
have
carried
oarsmen
of
our
day
to
many
a
victory
moreover
they
had
the
inducement
not
merely
of
a
prize
but
of
life
itself
to
row
and
to
row
hard
they
had
rolled
up
their
sleeves
and
the
mighty
muscles
on
those
arms
of
woven
steel
rose
and
fell
as
they
sent
the
boat
swiftly
with
the
silver
current
of
the
susquehanna
mary
newton
still
lay
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
children
had
cried
out
in
fright
once
or
twice
at
the
sound
of
the
firing
but
she
and
paul
bad
soothed
them
and
kept
them
down
somehow
mary
newton
had
become
possessed
of
a
great
faith
she
noticed
the
skill
speed
and
success
with
which
the
five
always
worked
and
so
long
given
up
to
despair
she
now
went
to
the
other
extreme
with
such
friends
as
these
coming
suddenly
out
of
the
void
everything
must
succeed
she
had
no
doubt
of
it
but
lay
peacefully
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
not
at
all
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
the
shots
paul
and
sol
after
a
while
relieved
long
jim
and
tom
at
the
oars
the
iroquois
thought
it
a
chance
to
creep
up
again
but
they
were
driven
back
by
a
third
bullet
and
once
more
kept
their
distance
sol
while
he
pulled
as
powerfully
as
tom
ross
whose
place
he
had
taken
nevertheless
was
not
silent
like
to
know
the
feelin
o
braxton
wyatt
an
that
feller
butler
he
said
be
powerful
tantalizin
to
them
to
see
us
here
almost
where
they
could
stretch
out
their
hands
an
put
on
us
like
fur
ripe
rich
fruit
an
failin
to
git
it
by
half
a
finger
are
certainly
not
pleased
said
henry
this
must
end
some
way
or
other
you
say
so
too
now
that
i
rejoined
the
shiftless
one
when
my
turn
at
the
oars
is
finished
i
would
care
ez
i
said
more
once
before
floatin
down
a
river
with
somebody
else
pullin
at
the
oars
is
the
life
jest
suited
to
henry
looked
up
summer
thunderstorm
is
coming
he
said
from
the
look
of
things
it
going
to
be
pretty
black
then
when
we
must
dodge
he
was
a
good
weather
prophet
in
a
half
hour
the
sky
began
to
darken
rapidly
there
was
a
great
deal
of
thunder
and
lightning
but
when
the
rain
came
the
air
was
almost
as
dark
as
night
mary
newton
and
her
children
were
covered
as
much
as
possible
with
the
blankets
and
then
they
swung
the
boat
rapidly
toward
the
eastern
shore
they
had
already
lost
sight
of
their
pursuers
in
the
darkness
and
as
they
coasted
along
the
shore
they
found
a
large
creek
flowing
into
the
river
from
the
east
they
ran
up
the
creek
and
were
a
full
mile
from
its
mouth
when
the
rain
ceased
then
the
sun
came
out
bright
and
warm
quickly
drying
everything
they
pulled
about
ten
miles
farther
until
the
creek
grew
too
shallow
for
them
when
they
hid
the
boat
among
bushes
and
took
to
the
land
two
days
later
they
arrived
at
a
strong
fort
and
settlement
where
mary
newton
and
her
four
children
safe
and
well
were
welcomed
by
relatives
who
had
mourned
them
as
dead
chapter
xv
they
arrived
at
the
fort
as
evening
was
coming
on
and
as
soon
as
food
was
served
to
them
the
five
sought
sleep
the
frontiersmen
usually
slept
soundly
and
for
a
long
time
after
prodigious
exertions
and
henry
and
his
comrades
were
too
wise
to
make
an
exception
they
secured
a
single
room
inside
the
fort
one
given
to
them
gladly
because
mary
newton
had
already
spread
the
fame
of
their
exploits
and
laying
aside
their
hunting
shirts
and
leggins
prepared
for
rest
said
sol
pointing
to
a
low
piece
of
furniture
flat
and
broad
in
one
corner
of
the
room

rejoined
long
jim

that
thar
hev
been
a
lot
uv
foolish
with
that
he
put
his
two
blankets
upon
the
floor
lay
down
upon
them
and
was
sound
asleep
in
five
minutes
but
sol
beat
him
to
slumberland
by
at
least
a
minute
and
the
others
were
not
more
than
two
minutes
behind
sol
henry
was
the
first
up
the
next
morning
a
strong
voice
shouted
in
his
ear
ware
by
all
that
glorious
and
a
hand
pressed
his
fingers
together
in
an
iron
grasp
henry
beheld
the
tall
thin
figure
and
smiling
brown
face
of
adam
colfax
with
whom
he
had
made
that
adventurous
journey
up
the
mississippi

ohio
the

a
capacity

all
at

and
we
all
still
the
face
of
the
new
englander
darkened
he
exclaimed
can
not
hear
of
it
without
every
vein
growing
hot
within
saw
things
done
there
said
henry
gravely
telling
of
which
few
men
can
bear
to
know
i
know
exclaimed
adam
colfax
news
of
it
has
spread
everywhere
we
want
said
henry
revenge
it
is
a
case
in
which
we
must
strike
back
and
strike
hard
if
this
thing
goes
on
not
a
white
life
will
be
safe
on
the
whole
border
from
the
lawrence
to
the
is
true
said
adam
colfax
we
would
send
an
army
now
against
the
iroquois
and
their
allies
but
henry
my
lad
our
fortunes
are
at
their
lowest
there
in
the
east
where
the
big
armies
are
fighting
that
is
the
reason
why
nobody
has
been
sent
to
protect
our
rear
guard
which
has
suffered
so
terribly
you
may
be
sure
too
that
the
iroquois
will
strike
in
this
region
again
as
often
and
as
hard
as
they
can
i
make
more
than
half
a
guess
that
you
and
your
comrades
are
here
because
you
know
he
looked
shrewdly
at
the
boy
said
henry
is
so
somehow
we
were
drawn
into
it
but
being
here
we
are
glad
to
stay
timmendiquas
the
great
chief
who
fought
us
so
fiercely
on
the
ohio
is
with
the
iroquois
with
a
detachment
of
his
wyandots
and
while
he
as
i
know
frowns
on
the
wyoming
massacre
he
means
to
help
thayendanegea
to
the
adam
colfax
looked
graver
than
ever
is
bad
he
said
is
a
mighty
warrior
and
leader
but
there
is
also
another
way
of
looking
at
it
his
presence
here
will
relieve
somewhat
the
pressure
on
kentucky
i
ought
to
tell
you
henry
that
we
got
through
safely
with
our
supplies
to
the
continental
army
and
they
could
not
possibly
have
been
more
welcome
they
arrived
just
in
the
others
came
forth
presently
and
were
greeted
with
the
same
warmth
by
adam
colfax
is
shore
mighty
good
for
the
eyes
to
see
you
colfax
said
sol
it
a
good
sign
our
people
won
when
you
were
on
the
mississippi
an
the
ohio
an
now
that
you
here
they
to
win
think
we
are
going
to
win
here
and
everywhere
said
adam
colfax
it
is
not
because
there
is
any
omen
in
my
presence
it
is
because
our
people
will
not
give
up
and
because
our
quarrel
is
the
stanch
new
englander
left
on
the
following
day
for
points
farther
east
planning
and
carrying
out
some
new
scheme
to
aid
the
patriot
cause
and
the
five
on
the
day
after
that
received
a
message
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
which
was
found
fastened
to
a
tree
on
the
outskirts
of
the
settlement
it
was
addressed
to
ware
and
those
with
him
and
it
read
need
not
think
because
you
escaped
us
at
wyoming
and
on
the
susquehanna
that
you
will
ever
get
back
to
kentucky
there
is
amighty
league
now
on
the
whole
border
between
the
indians
and
the
soldiers
of
the
king
you
have
seen
at
wyoming
what
we
can
do
and
you
will
see
at
other
places
and
on
a
greater
scale
what
we
will
do
find
my
own
position
perfect
it
is
true
that
timmendiquas
does
not
like
me
but
he
is
not
king
here
i
am
the
friend
of
the
great
brant
and
hiokatoo
sangerachte
hahiron
and
the
other
chiefs
esteem
me
i
am
thick
with
colonel
john
butler
the
victor
of
wyoming
his
son
the
valiant
and
worthy
walter
butler
sir
john
johnson
colonel
guy
johnson
colonel
daniel
claus
and
many
other
eminent
men
and
brave
soldiers
write
these
words
henry
ware
both
to
you
and
your
comrades
to
tell
you
that
our
cause
will
prevail
over
yours
i
do
not
doubt
that
when
you
read
this
you
will
try
to
escape
to
kentucky
but
when
we
have
destroyed
everything
along
the
eastern
border
as
we
have
at
wyoming
we
shall
come
to
kentucky
and
not
a
rebel
face
will
be
left
there
am
sending
this
to
tell
you
that
there
is
no
hole
in
which
you
can
hide
where
we
can
not
reach
you
with
my
respects
braxton
henry
regarded
the
letter
with
contempt
renegade
catches
something
of
the
indian
nature
he
said
always
likes
to
threaten
and
but
sol
was
highly
indignant
i
think
he
said
the
invention
o
writin
wuz
a
mistake
you
kin
send
a
man
a
letter
an
call
him
names
an
talk
mighty
big
when
he
a
hundred
miles
away
but
when
you
got
to
stan
up
to
him
face
to
face
an
say
it
you
change
your
tune
an
sing
a
sight
milder
you
ai
any
roarin
lion
think
i
keep
this
letter
said
henry
we
five
will
give
an
answer
to
it
later
he
tapped
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
and
every
one
of
the
four
gravely
tapped
the
muzzle
of
his
own
rifle
after
him
it
was
a
significant
action
nothing
more
was
needed
the
next
morning
they
bade
farewell
to
the
grateful
mary
newton
and
her
children
and
with
fresh
supplies
of
food
and
ammunition
chiefly
ammunition
left
the
fort
plunging
once
more
into
the
deep
forest
it
was
their
intention
to
do
as
much
damage
as
they
could
to
the
iroquois
until
some
great
force
capable
of
dealing
with
the
whole
six
nations
was
assembled
meanwhile
five
redoubtable
and
determined
borderers
could
achieve
something
it
was
about
the
first
of
august
and
they
were
in
the
midst
of
the
great
heats
but
it
was
a
period
favoring
indian
activity
which
was
now
at
its
highest
pitch
since
wyoming
loaded
with
scalps
flushed
with
victory
and
aided
by
the
king
men
they
felt
equal
to
anything
only
the
strongest
of
the
border
settlements
could
hold
them
back
the
colonists
here
were
so
much
reduced
and
so
little
help
could
be
sent
them
from
the
east
that
the
iroquois
were
able
to
divide
into
innumerable
small
parties
and
rake
the
country
as
with
a
fine
tooth
comb
they
never
missed
a
lone
farmhouse
and
rarely
was
any
fugitive
in
the
woods
able
to
evade
them
and
they
were
constantly
fed
from
the
north
with
arms
ammunition
rewards
for
scalps
bounties
and
great
promises
but
toward
the
close
of
august
the
iroquois
began
to
hear
of
a
silent
and
invisible
foe
an
evil
spirit
that
struck
them
and
that
struck
hard
there
were
battles
of
small
forces
in
which
sometimes
not
a
single
iroquois
escaped
captives
were
retaken
in
a
instances
and
the
warriors
who
escaped
reported
that
their
assailants
were
of
uncommon
size
and
power
they
had
all
the
cunning
of
the
indian
and
more
and
they
carried
rifles
that
slew
at
a
range
double
that
of
those
served
to
them
at
the
british
posts
it
was
a
certainty
that
they
were
guided
by
the
evil
spirit
because
every
attempt
to
capture
them
failed
miserably
no
one
could
find
where
they
slept
unless
it
was
those
who
never
came
back
again
the
iroquois
raged
and
so
did
the
butlers
and
the
johnsons
and
braxton
wyatt
this
was
a
flaw
in
their
triumph
and
the
british
and
tories
saw
also
that
it
was
beginning
to
affect
the
superstitions
of
their
red
allies
braxton
wyatt
made
a
shrewd
guess
as
to
the
identity
of
the
raiders
but
he
kept
quiet
it
is
likely
also
that
timmendiquas
knew
but
be
too
said
nothing
so
the
influence
of
the
raiders
grew
while
their
acts
were
great
superstition
exaggerated
them
and
their
powers
manifold
and
it
is
true
that
their
deeds
were
extraordinary
they
were
heard
of
on
the
susquehanna
then
on
the
delaware
and
its
branches
on
the
chemung
and
the
chenango
as
far
south
as
lackawaxen
creek
and
as
far
north
as
oneida
lake
it
is
likely
that
nobody
ever
accomplished
more
for
a
defense
than
did
those
five
in
the
waning
months
of
the
summer
late
in
september
the
most
significant
of
all
these
events
occurred
a
party
of
eight
tories
who
had
borne
a
terrible
part
in
the
wyoming
affair
was
attacked
on
the
shores
of
otsego
lake
with
such
deadly
fierceness
that
only
two
escaped
alive
to
the
camp
of
sir
john
johnson
brant
sent
out
six
war
parties
composed
of
not
less
than
twenty
warriors
apiece
to
seek
revenge
but
they
found
nothing
henry
and
his
comrades
had
found
a
remarkable
camp
at
the
edge
of
one
of
the
beautiful
small
lakes
in
which
the
region
abounds
the
cliff
at
that
point
was
high
but
a
creek
entered
into
it
through
a
ravine
at
the
entrance
of
the
creek
into
the
river
they
found
a
deep
alcove
or
rather
cave
in
the
rock
it
ran
so
far
back
that
it
afforded
ample
shelter
from
the
rain
and
that
was
all
they
wanted
it
was
about
halfway
between
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
cliff
and
was
difficult
of
approach
both
from
below
and
above
unless
completely
very
unlikely
thing
with
five
could
hold
it
against
any
force
as
long
as
their
provisions
lasted
they
also
built
a
boat
large
enough
for
five
which
they
hid
among
the
bushes
at
the
lake
edge
they
were
thus
provided
with
a
possible
means
of
escape
across
the
water
in
case
of
the
last
emergency
jim
and
paul
who
as
usual
filled
the
role
of
housekeepers
took
great
delight
in
fitting
up
this
forest
home
which
the
fittingly
called
the
floor
of
solid
stone
was
almost
smooth
and
with
the
aid
of
other
heavy
stones
they
broke
off
all
projections
until
one
could
walk
over
it
in
the
dark
in
perfect
comfort
they
hung
the
walls
with
skins
of
deer
which
they
killed
in
the
adjacent
woods
and
these
walls
furnished
many
nooks
and
crannies
for
the
storing
of
necessities
they
also
with
much
hard
effort
brought
many
loads
of
firewood
which
long
jim
was
to
use
for
his
cooking
he
built
his
little
fireplace
of
stones
so
near
the
mouth
of
that
the
smoke
would
pass
out
and
be
lost
in
the
thick
forest
all
about
if
the
wind
happened
to
be
blowing
toward
the
inside
of
the
cave
the
smoke
of
course
would
come
in
on
them
all
but
jim
would
not
be
cooking
then
nor
did
their
operations
cease
until
they
had
supplied
plentifully
with
food
chiefly
jerked
deer
meat
although
there
was
no
way
in
which
they
could
store
water
and
for
that
they
had
to
take
their
chances
but
their
success
the
product
of
skill
and
everlasting
caution
was
really
remarkable
three
times
they
were
trapped
within
a
few
miles
of
alcove
but
the
pursuers
invariably
went
astray
on
the
hard
rocky
ground
and
the
pursued
would
also
take
the
precaution
to
swim
down
the
creek
before
climbing
up
to
nobody
could
follow
a
trail
in
the
face
of
such
difficulties
it
was
henry
and
sol
who
were
followed
the
second
time
but
they
easily
shook
off
their
pursuers
as
the
twilight
was
coming
half
waded
half
swam
down
the
creek
and
climbed
up
to
alcove
where
the
others
were
waiting
for
them
with
cooked
food
and
clear
cold
water
when
they
had
eaten
and
were
refreshed
sol
sat
at
the
mouth
of
alcove
where
a
pleasant
breeze
entered
despite
the
foliage
that
hid
the
entrance
the
shiftless
one
was
in
an
especially
happy
mood
a
feelin
he
said
set
up
in
a
nice
safe
place
like
this
an
feel
that
the
woods
is
full
o
ragin
heathen
seekin
to
devour
you
and
wonderin
whar
you
gone
to
thar
a
heap
in
knowin
how
to
pick
your
home
i
thought
more
than
once
that
old
town
troy
that
paul
tells
us
an
i
made
up
my
mind
that
it
wuz
destroyed
helen
eat
too
many
golden
apples
but
old
king
prime
or
whoever
built
the
place
put
it
down
in
a
plain
that
wuz
shore
a
foolish
thing
now
ef
he
built
it
on
a
mountain
with
a
steep
on
every
side
thar
would
hev
been
enough
greeks
in
all
the
earth
to
take
it
considerin
the
miserable
weepins
they
used
in
them
times
why
hector
could
hev
set
tight
on
the
walls
laughin
at
o
goin
out
in
the
plain
an
killed
by
fur
which
i
always
been
people
nowadays
have
more
sense
than
they
did
in
them
ancient
times
that
paul
tells
about
said
long
jim
thar
wuz
ten
or
twelve
years
gittin
home
from
troy
allus
his
ship
on
the
rocks
hoppin
into
trouble
with
giants
women
an
sech
like
why
did
he
walk
home
through
the
woods
killin
game
on
the
way
an
hevin
the
best
time
he
ever
knowed
then
thar
wuz
the
keerlessness
of
ma
dippin
him
in
that
river
so
no
arrow
could
enter
him
but
holdin
him
by
the
heel
keepin
it
out
o
the
water
which
caused
his
death
the
very
first
time
paris
shot
it
off
with
his
little
bow
an
arrer
why
did
she
hev
sense
enough
to
let
the
heel
go
under
too
she
could
hev
dragged
it
out
in
two
seconds
an
no
harm
done
perhaps
a
little
more
on
the
part
of
always
thought
paul
hez
got
mixed
that
paris
story
said
tom
ross
used
to
think
paris
was
the
name
uv
a
town
not
a
man
i
beginnin
to
think
so
sence
i
been
in
the
east
i
know
now
that
whar
the
french
come
paris
was
the
name
of
a
man
persisted
paul
the
french
named
their
capital
after
the
paris
of
the
trojan
they
showed
mighty
poor
jedgment
said
sol
named
my
capital
after
any
them
old
fellers
i
have
called
it
can
have
danger
enough
when
you
on
the
tops
of
hills
said
henry
who
was
sitting
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave
here
you
fellows
and
see
what
passing
down
the
they
looked
out
and
in
the
moonlight
saw
six
large
war
canoes
being
rowed
slowly
down
the
lake
which
though
narrow
was
quite
long
each
canoe
held
about
a
dozen
warriors
and
henry
believed
that
one
of
them
contained
two
white
faces
evidently
those
of
braxton
wyatt
and
walter
butler
ez
not
they
been
lookin
fur
us
said
tom
ross
likely
said
henry
at
the
same
time
they
may
be
engaged
in
some
general
movement
see
they
will
pass
within
fifty
feet
of
the
base
of
the
the
five
lay
on
the
cave
floor
looking
through
the
vines
and
foliage
and
they
felt
quite
sure
that
they
were
in
absolute
security
the
six
long
war
canoes
moved
slowly
the
moonlight
came
out
more
brightly
and
flooded
all
the
bronze
faces
of
the
iroquois
henry
now
saw
that
he
was
not
mistaken
and
that
braxton
wyatt
and
walter
butler
were
really
in
the
first
boat
from
the
cover
of
the
cliff
he
could
have
picked
off
either
with
a
rifle
bullet
and
the
temptation
was
powerful
but
he
knew
that
it
would
lead
to
an
immediate
siege
from
which
they
might
not
escape
and
which
at
least
would
check
their
activities
and
plans
for
a
long
time
similar
impulses
flitted
through
the
minds
of
the
other
four
but
all
kept
still
although
fingers
flitted
noiselessly
along
rifle
stocks
until
they
touched
triggers
the
iroquois
war
fleet
moved
slowly
on
the
two
renegades
never
dreaming
of
the
danger
that
had
threatened
them
an
unusually
bright
ray
of
moonshine
fell
full
upon
braxton
wyatt
face
as
he
paused
and
finger
played
with
the
trigger
of
his
rifle
it
was
hard
very
hard
to
let
such
an
opportunity
go
by
but
it
must
be
done
the
fleet
moved
steadily
down
the
lake
the
canoes
keeping
close
together
they
turned
into
mere
dots
upon
the
water
became
smaller
and
smaller
still
until
they
vanished
in
the
darkness
thinkin
said
sol
thar
some
kind
uv
a
movement
on
foot
while
they
may
hev
been
lookin
fur
us
it
ai
likely
that
they
send
sixty
warriors
or
so
fur
sech
a
purpose
i
heard
something
three
or
four
days
ago
from
a
hunter
about
an
attack
upon
the
iroquois
town
of
most
likely
true
said
henry
it
seems
to
me
that
it
our
business
to
join
that
expedition
what
do
you
fellows
think
as
you
do
they
replied
with
unanimity
we
leave
this
place
and
start
in
the
morning
said
henry
chapter
xvi
the
first
blow
summer
was
now
waning
the
foliage
was
taking
on
its
autumn
hues
and
indian
war
parties
still
surged
over
the
hills
and
mountains
but
the
five
avoided
them
all
on
one
or
two
occasions
they
would
have
been
willing
to
stop
and
fight
but
they
had
bigger
work
on
hand
they
had
received
from
others
confirmation
of
the
report
that
long
jim
had
heard
from
the
hunters
and
they
were
quite
sure
that
a
strong
force
was
advancing
to
strike
the
first
blow
in
revenge
for
wyoming
curiously
enough
this
body
was
commanded
by
a
fourth
butler
colonel
william
butler
and
according
to
report
it
was
large
and
its
leaders
capable
when
the
avenging
force
lay
at
the
johnstown
settlement
on
the
delaware
it
was
joined
by
the
five
they
were
introduced
to
the
colonel
by
the
celebrated
scout
and
hunter
tini
murphy
whom
they
had
met
several
times
in
the
woods
and
they
were
received
warmly
heard
of
you
said
colonel
butler
with
much
warmth
from
hunters
and
scouts
and
also
from
adam
colfax
two
of
you
were
to
have
been
tomahawked
by
queen
esther
at
henry
indicated
the
two
you
saw
at
wyoming
is
not
likely
to
decrease
your
zeal
against
the
indians
and
their
white
allies
continued
colonel
butler
who
was
there
said
henry
feel
all
his
life
the
desire
to
punish
those
who
did
think
so
too
from
all
that
i
have
heard
continued
colonel
butler
is
the
business
of
you
young
men
to
keep
ahead
of
our
column
and
warn
us
of
what
lies
before
us
i
believe
you
have
volunteered
for
that
the
five
looked
over
colonel
butler
little
army
which
numbered
only
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
but
they
were
all
strong
and
brave
and
it
was
the
best
force
that
could
yet
be
sent
to
the
harassed
border
it
might
after
all
strike
a
blow
for
wyoming
if
it
marched
into
no
ambush
and
henry
and
his
comrades
were
resolved
to
guard
it
from
that
greatest
of
all
dangers
when
the
little
column
moved
from
the
johnstown
settlement
the
five
were
far
ahead
passing
through
the
woods
up
the
susquehanna
toward
the
indian
villages
that
lay
on
its
banks
though
a
great
distance
above
wyoming
the
chief
of
these
was
oghwaga
and
knowing
that
it
was
the
destination
of
the
little
army
they
were
resolved
to
visit
it
or
at
least
come
so
near
it
that
they
could
see
what
manner
of
place
it
was
it
a
big
village
said
colonel
butler
will
be
too
strong
to
attack
but
it
may
be
that
most
of
the
warriors
are
absent
on
they
had
obtained
before
starting
very
careful
descriptions
of
the
approaches
to
the
village
and
toward
the
close
of
an
october
evening
they
knew
that
they
were
near
oghwaga
the
great
base
of
the
iroquois
supplies
they
considered
it
very
risky
and
unwise
to
approach
in
the
daytime
and
accordingly
they
lay
in
the
woods
until
the
dark
should
come
the
appearance
of
the
wilderness
had
changed
greatly
in
the
three
months
since
wyoming
all
the
green
was
now
gone
and
it
was
tinted
red
and
yellow
and
brown
the
skies
were
a
mellow
blue
and
there
was
a
slight
haze
over
the
forest
but
the
air
had
the
wonderful
crispness
and
freshness
of
the
american
autumn
it
inspired
every
one
of
the
five
with
fresh
zeal
and
energy
because
they
believed
the
first
blow
was
about
to
be
struck
about
ten
at
night
they
approached
oghwaga
and
the
reports
of
its
importance
were
confirmed
they
had
not
before
seen
an
indian
village
with
so
many
signs
of
permanence
they
passed
two
or
three
orchards
of
apple
and
peach
trees
and
they
saw
other
indications
of
cultivation
like
that
of
the
white
farmer
ai
a
town
said
long
jim
hart
it
look
wuss
said
sol
they
laid
an
ambush
somewhar
i
do
like
to
see
houses
an
sech
like
go
up
in
fire
an
smoke
but
after
what
wuz
done
at
wyomin
an
all
through
that
valley
burnin
is
a
light
bound
to
strike
back
with
all
our
might
said
paul
who
had
the
softest
heart
of
them
all
i
wonder
who
in
this
here
town
said
tom
ross
timmendiquas
an
brant
an
all
them
may
be
so
said
henry
is
their
base
and
store
of
supplies
oh
if
colonel
butler
were
only
here
with
all
his
men
what
a
rush
we
could
make
so
great
was
their
eagerness
that
they
crept
closer
to
the
village
passing
among
some
thick
clusters
of
grapevines
henry
was
in
the
lead
and
he
heard
a
sudden
snarl
a
large
cur
of
the
kind
that
infest
indian
villages
leaped
straight
at
him
the
very
suddenness
of
the
attack
saved
henry
and
his
comrades
from
the
consequences
of
an
alarm
he
dropped
his
rifle
instinctively
and
seized
the
dog
by
the
throat
with
both
hands
a
bark
following
the
snarl
had
risen
to
the
animal
throat
but
it
was
cut
short
there
the
hands
of
the
great
youth
pressed
tighter
and
tighter
and
the
dog
was
lifted
from
the
earth
the
four
stood
quietly
beside
their
comrade
knowing
that
no
alarm
would
be
made
now
the
dog
kicked
convulsively
then
hung
without
motion
or
noise
henry
cast
the
dead
body
aside
picked
up
his
rifle
and
then
all
five
of
them
sank
softly
down
in
the
shelter
of
the
grapevines
about
fifteen
yards
away
an
indian
warrior
was
walking
cautiously
along
and
looking
among
the
vines
evidently
he
had
heard
the
snarl
of
the
dog
and
was
seeking
the
cause
but
it
had
been
only
a
single
sound
and
he
would
not
look
far
yet
the
hearts
of
the
five
beat
a
little
faster
as
he
prowled
among
the
vines
and
their
nerves
were
tense
for
action
should
the
need
for
it
come
the
indian
a
mohawk
came
within
ten
yards
of
them
but
he
did
not
see
the
five
figures
among
the
vines
blending
darkly
with
the
dark
growth
and
presently
satisfied
that
the
sound
he
had
heard
was
of
no
importance
he
walked
in
another
direction
and
passed
out
of
sight
the
five
not
daunted
at
all
by
this
living
proof
of
risk
crept
to
the
very
edge
of
the
clusters
of
grapevines
and
looked
upon
an
open
space
beyond
which
stood
some
houses
made
of
wood
but
their
attention
was
centered
upon
a
figure
that
stood
in
the
open
although
the
distance
was
too
great
and
the
light
too
poor
to
disclose
the
features
every
one
of
the
scouts
recognized
the
figure
it
could
be
none
other
than
that
of
timmendiquas
the
great
white
lightning
of
the
wyandots
he
was
pacing
back
and
forth
somewhat
in
the
fashion
of
the
white
man
and
his
manner
implied
thought
could
bring
him
down
from
here
with
a
bullet
said
sol
i
ai
ever
goin
to
shoot
at
the
chief
said
henry
will
i
but
look
there
a
second
figure
came
out
of
the
dark
and
joined
the
first
it
was
also
that
of
a
chief
powerful
and
tall
though
not
as
tall
as
timmendiquas
it
was
thayendanegea
then
three
white
figures
appeared
one
was
that
of
braxton
wyatt
and
the
others
they
took
to
be
those
of
butler
and
his
son
walter
butler
after
a
talk
of
a
minute
or
two
they
entered
one
of
the
wooden
houses
to
be
a
conference
of
some
kind
whispered
henry
wish
i
could
look
in
on
i
said
the
others
together
we
know
this
much
continued
henry
great
force
of
the
iroquois
is
present
and
if
colonel
butler
men
come
up
quickly
we
can
take
the
a
chance
not
to
be
lost
said
paul
they
crept
slowly
away
from
the
village
not
stopping
until
they
reached
the
crest
of
a
hill
from
which
they
could
see
the
roofs
of
two
or
three
of
the
indian
houses
a
feeling
in
me
said
paul
the
place
is
doomed
strike
the
first
blow
for
they
neither
slept
nor
rested
that
night
but
retraced
their
trail
with
the
utmost
speed
toward
the
marching
american
force
going
in
indian
file
through
the
wilderness
henry
as
usual
led
sol
followed
then
came
paul
and
then
long
jim
while
silent
tom
was
the
rear
guard
they
traveled
at
great
speed
and
some
time
after
daylight
met
the
advance
of
the
colonial
force
under
captain
william
gray
william
gray
was
a
gallant
young
officer
but
he
was
startled
a
little
when
five
figures
as
silent
as
phantoms
appeared
but
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
when
he
recognized
the
leader
henry
have
you
found
he
asked
eagerly
been
to
oghwaga
replied
the
youth
we
went
all
about
the
town
they
do
not
suspect
our
coming
at
least
they
did
not
know
when
we
left
we
saw
brant
timmendiquas
the
butlers
and
wyatt
enter
the
house
for
a
now
is
our
chance
said
eager
young
william
gray
if
we
should
take
the
town
and
with
it
these
men
at
one
can
scarcely
hope
for
as
much
as
that
said
henry
who
knew
that
men
like
timmendiquas
and
thayendanegea
were
not
likely
to
allow
themselves
to
be
seized
by
so
small
a
force
we
can
hope
for
a
good
the
young
captain
rode
quickly
back
to
his
comrades
with
the
news
and
led
by
the
five
the
whole
force
pushed
forward
with
all
possible
haste
william
gray
was
still
sanguine
of
a
surprise
but
the
young
riflemen
did
not
expect
it
indian
sentinels
were
sure
to
be
in
the
forest
between
them
and
oghwaga
yet
they
said
nothing
to
dash
this
hope
henry
had
already
seen
enough
to
know
the
immense
value
of
enthusiasm
and
the
little
army
full
of
zeal
would
accomplish
much
if
the
chance
came
besides
the
young
captain
william
gray
there
was
a
lieutenant
named
taylor
who
had
been
in
the
battle
at
wyoming
but
who
had
escaped
the
massacre
the
five
had
not
met
him
there
but
the
common
share
in
so
great
a
tragedy
proved
a
tie
between
them
taylor
name
was
robert
but
all
the
other
officers
and
some
of
the
men
for
that
matter
who
had
known
him
in
childhood
called
him
bob
he
was
but
little
older
than
henry
and
his
earlier
youth
before
removal
to
wyoming
had
been
passed
in
connecticut
a
country
that
was
to
the
colonials
thickly
populated
and
containing
great
towns
such
as
hartford
and
new
haven
a
third
close
friend
whom
they
soon
found
was
a
man
unlike
any
other
that
they
had
ever
seen
his
name
was
cornelius
heemskerk
holland
was
his
birthplace
but
america
was
his
nation
he
was
short
and
extremely
fat
but
he
had
an
agility
that
amazed
the
five
when
they
first
saw
it
displayed
he
talked
much
and
his
words
sounded
like
grumbles
but
the
unctuous
tone
and
the
smile
that
accompanied
them
indicated
to
the
contrary
he
formed
for
sol
an
inexhaustible
and
entertaining
study
in
character
ai
quite
seen
his
like
afore
said
the
shiftless
one
to
paul
time
i
run
acrost
him
i
thought
he
would
tumble
down
among
the
first
bushes
he
met
o
that
he
sailed
right
through
never
a
trip
an
no
noise
at
all
same
ez
long
jim

long
jim
who
also
contemplated
the
prodigy
big
chunky
things
are
sometimes
ez
spry
ez
you
they
say
that
the
hipperpotamus

paul

replied
paul
who
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
correct
long
jim
history
i
willing
to
predict
to
you
jim
hart
that
heemskerk
will
be
a
mighty
good
man
in
any
fight
that
we
may
heemskerk
rolled
up
to
them
he
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
circular
motion
like
that
of
a
revolving
tube
but
he
kept
pace
with
the
others
nevertheless
and
he
showed
no
signs
of
exertion
you
think
it
a
funny
thing
that
i
cornelius
heemskerk
am
here
he
said
to
paul
so
heemskerk
replied
paul
politely
i
am
a
dutchman
i
have
the
soul
of
an
artist
and
the
gentleness
of
a
baby
i
cornelius
heemskerk
should
be
in
the
goot
leetle
country
of
holland
in
a
goot
leetle
house
by
the
side
of
a
goot
leetle

painting

cups
saucers
all
most
beautiful
and
here
i
am
running
through
the
woods
of
this
vast
america
carrying
on
my
shoulder
a
rifle
that
is
longer
than
i
am
hunting
the
red
indian
and
hunted
by
him
is
it
not
most
rediculous
mynheer
paul
think
you
are
here
because
you
are
a
brave
man
heemskerk
replied
paul
wish
to
see
punishment
inflicted
upon
those
who
have
committed
great
so
not
so
replied
the
dutchman
with
energy
is
because
i
am
one
big
fool
i
am
not
really
a
big
enough
man
to
be
as
big
a
fool
as
i
am
but
so
it
is
so
it
is
sol
regarded
him
critically
and
then
spoke
gravely
and
with
deliberation
ai
that
heemskerk
an
paul
ai
told
quite
all
the
truth
either
i
heard
that
the
dutch
was
the
most
powerfullest
fightin
leetle
nation
on
the
globe
that
all
you
had
to
do
wuz
to
step
on
the
toe
uv
a
dutchman
wooden

an
all
the

i
concludin
that

an
that

cornelius
heemskerk
sighed
and
shook
his
head
is
flattery
that
you
give
me
and
you
are
trying
to
make
me
brave
when
i
am

he
said
only
say
once
more
that
i
ought
to
be
in
holland
painting
blue
plates
and
not
here
in
the
great
woods
holding
on
to
my

first
with
one
hand
and
then
with
the
he
sighed
deeply
but
solomon

reader
of
the
hearts
of
men
only
laughed
colonel
butler
force
stopped
about
three
for
food
and
a
little
rest
and
the
five
who
had
not
slept
since
the
night
before
caught
a
few
winks
but
in
less
than
an
hour
they
were
up
and
away
again
the
five
riflemen
were
once
more
well
in
advance
and
with
them
were
taylor
and
heemskerk
the
dutchman
grumbling
over
their
speed
but
revolving
along
nevertheless
with
astonishing
ease
and
without
any
sign
of
fatigue
they
discovered
no
indications
of
indian
scouts
or
trails
and
as
the
village
now
was
not
many
miles
away
it
confirmed
henry
in
his
belief
that
the
iroquois
with
their
friends
the
wyandots
would
not
stay
to
give
battle
if
thayendanegea
and
timmendiquas
were
prepared
for
a
strong
resistance
the
bullets
of
the
skirmishers
would
already
be
whistling
through
the
woods
the
waning
evening
grew
colder
twilight
came
and
the
autumn
leaves
fell
fast
before
the
rising
wind
the
promise
of
the
night
was
dark
which
was
not
bad
for
their
design
and
once
more
the
the
seven
approached
oghwaga
from
the
crest
of
the
very
same
hill
they
looked
down
once
more
upon
the
indian
houses
is
a
great
base
for
the
iroquois
said
henry
to
heemskerk
whether
the
indians
have
laid
an
ambush
or
not
colonel
butler
must
said
heemskerk
silently
moving
his
round
body
to
a
little
higher
point
for
a
better
view
i
feel
in
all
its
fullness
the
truth
that
i
should
be
back
in
holland
painting
blue
nevertheless
cornelius
heemskerk
made
a
very
accurate
survey
of
the
iroquois
village
considering
the
distance
and
the
brevity
of
the
time
and
when
the
party
went
back
to
colonel
butler
to
tell
him
the
way
was
open
he
revolved
along
as
swiftly
as
any
of
them
there
were
also
many
serious
thoughts
in
the
back
of
his
head
at
nine
the
little
colonial
force
was
within
half
a
mile
of
oghwaga
and
nothing
had
yet
occurred
to
disclose
whether
the
iroquois
knew
of
their
advance
henry
and
his
comrades
well
in
front
looked
down
upon
the
town
but
saw
nothing
no
light
came
from
an
indian
chimney
nor
did
any
dog
howl
just
behind
them
were
the
troops
in
loose
order
colonel
butler
impatiently
striking
his
booted
leg
with
a
switch
and
william
gray
seeking
to
restrain
his
ardor
that
he
might
set
a
good
example
to
the
men
do
you
think
ware
asked
colonel
butler
think
we
ought
to
rush
the
town
at
is
so
exclaimed
heemskerk
forgetting
all
about
painting
blue
plates
signal
is
the
trumpet
you
blow
it
captain
gray
and
then
william
gray
took
the
trumpet
from
one
of
the
men
and
blew
a
long
thrilling
note
before
its
last
echo
was
ended
the
little
army
rushed
upon
the
town
three
or
four
shots
came
from
the
houses
and
the
soldiers
fired
a
few
at
random
in
return
but
that
was
all
indian
scouts
had
brought
warning
of
the
white
advance
and
the
great
chiefs
gathering
up
all
the
people
who
were
in
the
village
had
fled
a
retreating
warrior
or
two
had
fired
the
shots
but
when
the
white
men
entered
this
important
iroquois
stronghold
they
did
not
find
a
single
human
being
timmendiquas
the
white
lightning
of
the
wyandots
was
gone
thayendanegea
the
real
head
of
the
six
nations
had
slipped
away
and
with
them
had
vanished
the
renegades
but
they
had
gone
in
haste
all
around
them
were
the
evidences
the
houses
built
of
wood
were
scores
in
number
and
many
of
them
contained
furniture
such
as
a
prosperous
white
man
of
the
border
would
buy
for
himself
there
were
gardens
and
shade
trees
about
these
and
back
of
them
barns
many
of
them
filled
with
indian
corn
farther
on
were
clusters
of
bark
lodges
which
had
been
inhabited
by
the
less
progressive
of
the
iroquois
henry
stood
in
the
center
of
the
town
and
looked
at
the
houses
misty
in
the
moonlight
the
army
had
not
yet
made
much
noise
but
he
was
beginning
to
hear
behind
him
the
ominous
word
repeated
more
than
once
cornelius
heemskerk
had
stopped
revolving
and
standing
beside
henry
wiped
his
perspiring
red
face
that
i
am
here
i
think
again
of
the
blue
plates
of
holland
ware
he
said
is
a
dark
and
sanguinary
time
the
men
whose
brethren
were
scalped
or
burned
alive
at
wyoming
will
not
now
spare
the
town
of
those
who
did
it
in
this
wilderness
they
give
blow
for
blow
or
henry
knew
that
it
was
true
but
he
felt
a
certain
sadness
his
heart
had
been
inflamed
against
the
iroquois
he
could
never
forget
wyoming
or
its
horrors
but
in
the
destruction
of
an
ancient
town
the
long
labor
of
man
perished
and
it
seemed
waste
doubtless
a
dozen
generations
of
iroquois
children
had
played
here
on
the
grass
he
walked
toward
the
northern
end
of
the
village
and
saw
fields
there
from
which
recent
corn
had
been
taken
but
behind
him
the
cry
was
repeated
louder
and
oftener
now
then
he
saw
men
running
here
and
there
with
torches
and
presently
smoke
and
flame
burst
from
the
houses
he
examined
the
fields
and
forest
for
a
little
distance
to
see
if
any
ambushed
foe
might
still
lie
among
them
but
all
the
while
the
flame
and
smoke
behind
him
were
rising
higher
henry
turned
back
and
joined
his
comrades
oghwaga
was
perishing
the
flames
leaped
from
house
to
house
and
then
from
lodge
to
lodge
there
was
no
need
to
use
torches
any
more
the
whole
village
was
wrapped
in
a
mass
of
fire
that
grew
and
swelled
until
the
flames
rose
above
the
forest
and
were
visible
in
the
clear
night
miles
away
so
great
was
the
heat
that
colonel
butler
and
the
soldiers
and
scouts
were
compelled
to
withdraw
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
the
wind
rose
and
the
flames
soared
sparks
flew
in
myriads
and
ashes
fell
dustily
on
the
dry
leaves
of
the
trees
bob
taylor
with
his
hands
clenched
tightly
muttered
under
his
breath
wyoming
is
the
iroquois
who
suffer
now
said
heemskerk
as
he
revolved
slowly
away
from
a
heated
point
crashes
came
presently
as
the
houses
fell
in
and
then
the
sparks
would
leap
higher
and
the
flames
roar
louder
the
barns
too
were
falling
down
and
the
grain
was
destroyed
the
grapevines
were
trampled
under
foot
and
the
gardens
were
ruined
oghwaga
a
great
central
base
of
the
six
nations
was
vanishing
forever
for
four
hundred
years
ever
since
the
days
of
hiawatha
the
iroquois
had
waxed
in
power
they
had
ruled
over
lands
larger
than
great
empires
they
had
built
up
political
and
social
systems
that
are
the
wonder
of
students
they
were
invincible
in
war
because
every
man
had
been
trained
from
birth
to
be
a
warrior
and
now
they
were
receiving
their
first
great
blow
from
a
point
far
in
the
forest
miles
away
thayendanegea
timmendiquas
hiokatoo
sangerachte
butler
walter
butler
braxton
wyatt
a
low
heavybrowed
tory
named
coleman
with
whom
wyatt
had
become
very
friendly
and
about
sixty
iroquois
and
twenty
tories
were
watching
a
tower
of
light
to
the
south
that
had
just
appeared
above
the
trees
it
was
of
an
intense
fiery
color
and
every
indian
in
that
gloomy
band
knew
that
it
was
oghwaga
the
great
the
inviolate
the
sacred
that
was
burning
and
that
the
men
who
were
doing
it
were
the
white
frontiersmen
who
his
allies
had
told
him
would
soon
be
swept
forever
from
these
woods
and
they
were
forced
to
stand
and
see
it
not
daring
to
attack
so
strong
and
alert
a
force
they
sat
there
in
the
darkness
among
the
trees
and
watched
the
column
of
fire
grow
and
grow
until
it
seemed
to
pierce
the
skies
timmendiquas
never
said
a
word
in
his
heart
indian
though
he
was
he
felt
that
the
iroquois
had
gone
too
far
in
him
was
the
spirit
of
the
farseeing
hiawatha
he
could
perceive
that
great
cruelty
always
brought
retaliation
but
it
was
not
for
him
almost
an
alien
to
say
these
things
to
thayendanegea
the
mighty
war
chief
of
the
mohawks
and
the
living
spirit
of
the
iroquois
nation
thayendanegea
sat
on
the
stump
of
a
tree
blown
down
by
winter
storms
his
arms
were
folded
across
his
breast
and
he
looked
steadily
toward
that
red
threatening
light
off
there
in
the
south
some
such
idea
as
that
in
the
mind
of
timmendiquas
may
have
been
passing
in
his
own
he
was
an
uncommon
indian
and
he
had
had
uncommon
advantages
he
had
not
believed
that
the
colonists
could
make
head
against
so
great
a
kingdom
as
england
aided
by
the
allied
tribes
the
canadians
and
the
large
body
of
tories
among
their
own
people
but
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
the
famous
oghwaga
of
the
iroquois
going
down
under
their
torch
me
colonel
john
butler
he
said
bitterly
is
your
great
king
now
is
his
arm
long
enough
to
reach
from
london
to
save
our
town
of
oghwaga
which
is
perhaps
as
much
to
us
as
his
great
city
of
london
is
to
him
the
thickset
figure
of
butler
moved
and
his
swart
face
flushed
as
much
as
it
could
know
as
much
about
the
king
as
i
do
joe
brant
he
replied
are
fighting
here
for
your
country
as
well
as
his
and
you
can
not
say
that
johnson
greens
and
butler
rangers
and
the
british
and
canadians
have
not
done
their
is
true
said
thayendanegea
it
is
true
also
that
one
must
fight
with
wisdom
perhaps
there
was
too
much
burning
of
living
men
at
wyoming
the
pain
of
the
wounded
bear
makes
him
fight
the
harder
and
it
is
because
of
wyoming
that
oghwaga
yonder
burns
say
is
it
not
so
colonel
john
butler
butler
made
no
reply
but
sat
sullen
and
lowering
the
tory
coleman
whispered
to
braxton
wyatt
but
timmendiquas
was
the
only
one
who
spoke
aloud
he
said
and
the
wyandots
who
are
with
me
have
come
far
we
expected
to
return
long
ago
to
the
lands
on
the
ohio
but
we
were
with
you
in
your
village
and
now
when
manitou
has
turned
his
face
from
you
for
the
time
we
will
not
leave
you
we
stay
and
fight
by
your
thayendanegea
stood
up
and
timmendiquas
stood
up
also
are
a
great
chief
white
lightning
of
the
wyandots
he
said
you
and
i
are
brothers
i
shall
be
proud
and
happy
to
have
such
a
mighty
leader
fighting
with
me
we
will
have
vengeance
for
this
the
power
of
the
iroquois
is
as
great
as
he
raised
himself
to
his
full
height
pointing
to
the
fire
and
the
flames
of
hate
and
resolve
burned
in
his
eyes
old
hiokatoo
the
most
savage
of
all
the
chiefs
shook
his
tomahawk
and
a
murmur
passed
through
the
group
of
indians
braxton
wyatt
still
talked
in
whispers
to
his
new
friend
coleman
the
tory
who
was
more
to
his
liking
than
the
morose
and
savage
walter
butler
whom
he
somewhat
feared
wyatt
was
perhaps
the
least
troubled
of
all
those
present
caring
for
himself
only
the
burning
of
oghwaga
caused
him
no
grief
he
suffered
neither
from
the
misfortune
of
friend
nor
foe
he
was
able
to
contemplate
the
glowing
tower
of
light
with
curiosity
only
braxton
wyatt
knew
that
the
iroquois
and
their
allies
would
attempt
revenge
for
the
burning
of
oghwaga
and
he
saw
profit
for
himself
in
such
adventures
his
horizon
had
broadened
somewhat
of
late
the
renegade
blackstaffe
had
returned
to
rejoin
simon
girty
but
he
had
found
a
new
friend
in
coleman
he
was
coming
now
more
into
touch
with
the
larger
forces
in
the
east
nearer
to
the
seat
of
the
great
war
and
he
hoped
to
profit
by
it
is
a
terrible
blow
to
brant
coleman
whispered
to
him
iroquois
have
been
able
to
ravage
the
whole
frontier
while
the
rebels
occupied
with
the
king
troops
have
not
been
able
to
send
help
to
their
own
but
they
have
managed
to
strike
at
last
as
you
do
see
said
wyatt
on
the
whole
coleman
i
not
sorry
perhaps
these
chiefs
wo
be
so
haughty
now
and
they
soon
realize
that
they
need
likely
chaps
such
as
you
and
me
eh
not
far
from
the
truth
said
coleman
laughing
a
little
and
pleased
at
the
penetration
of
his
new
friend
they
did
not
talk
further
although
the
agreement
between
them
was
well
established
neither
did
the
indian
chiefs
or
the
tory
leaders
say
any
more
they
watched
the
tower
of
fire
a
long
time
past
midnight
until
it
reached
its
zenith
and
then
began
to
sink
they
saw
its
crest
go
down
behind
the
trees
and
they
saw
the
luminous
cloud
in
the
south
fade
and
go
out
entirely
leaving
there
only
the
darkness
that
reined
everywhere
else
then
the
indian
and
tory
leaders
rose
and
silently
marched
northward
it
was
nearly
dawn
when
henry
and
his
comrades
lay
down
for
the
rest
that
they
needed
badly
they
spread
their
blankets
at
the
edge
of
the
open
but
well
back
from
the
burned
area
which
was
now
one
great
mass
of
coals
and
charred
timbers
sending
up
little
flame
but
much
smoke
many
of
the
troops
were
already
asleep
but
henry
before
lying
down
begged
william
gray
to
keep
a
strict
watch
lest
the
iroquois
attack
from
ambush
he
knew
that
the
rashness
and
confidence
of
the
borderers
especially
when
drawn
together
in
masses
had
often
caused
them
great
losses
and
he
was
resolved
to
prevent
a
recurrence
at
the
present
time
if
he
could
he
had
made
these
urgent
requests
of
gray
instead
of
colonel
butler
because
of
the
latter
youth
and
willingness
to
take
advice
have
the
forest
beat
up
continually
all
about
the
town
he
said
must
not
have
our
triumph
spoiled
by
any
henry
and
his
comrades
wrapped
in
their
blankets
lay
in
a
row
almost
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
the
heat
from
the
fire
was
still
great
but
it
would
die
down
after
a
while
and
the
october
air
was
nipping
henry
usually
fell
asleep
in
a
very
few
minutes
but
this
time
despite
his
long
exertions
and
lack
of
rest
he
remained
awake
when
his
comrades
were
sound
asleep
then
he
fell
into
a
drowsy
state
in
which
he
saw
the
fire
rising
in
great
black
coils
that
united
far
above
it
seemed
to
henry
half
dreaming
and
forecasting
the
future
that
the
indian
spirit
was
passing
in
the
smoke
when
he
fell
asleep
it
was
nearly
daylight
and
in
three
or
four
hours
he
was
up
again
as
the
little
army
intended
to
march
at
once
upon
another
indian
town
the
hours
while
he
slept
had
passed
in
silence
and
no
indians
had
come
near
william
gray
had
seen
to
that
and
his
best
scout
had
been
one
cornelius
heemskerk
a
short
stout
man
of
dutch
birth
was
one
long
long
tramp
for
me
mynheer
henry
said
heemskerk
as
he
revolved
slowly
up
to
the
camp
fire
where
henry
was
eating
his
breakfast
i
am
now
very
tired
it
was
like
walking
four
or
five
times
around
holland
which
is
such
a
fine
little
country
with
the
canals
and
the
flowers
along
them
and
no
great
dark
woods
filled
with
the
fierce
i
a
notion
mynheer
heemskerk
that
you
rather
be
here
and
perhaps
before
the
day
is
over
you
will
get
some
fighting
hot
enough
to
please
even
mynheer
heemskerk
threw
up
his
hands
in
dismay
but
a
half
hour
later
he
was
eagerly
discussing
with
henry
the
possibility
of
overtaking
some
large
band
of
retreating
iroquois
urged
on
by
all
the
scouts
and
by
those
who
had
suffered
at
wyoming
colonel
butler
gathered
his
forces
and
marched
swiftly
that
very
morning
up
the
river
against
another
indian
town
cunahunta
fortunately
for
him
a
band
of
riflemen
and
scouts
unsurpassed
in
skill
led
the
way
and
saw
to
it
that
the
road
was
safe
in
this
band
were
the
five
of
course
and
after
them
heemskerk
young
taylor
and
several
others
the
iroquois
do
not
get
in
our
way
we
strike
cunahunta
before
night
said
heemskerk
who
knew
the
way
seems
to
me
that
they
will
certainly
try
to
save
their
towns
said
henry
brant
and
the
tories
will
not
let
us
strike
so
great
a
blow
without
a
of
their
warriors
are
elsewhere
mynheer
henry
said
heemskerk
they
would
certainly
give
us
a
big
battle
we
been
lucky
in
the
time
of
our
advance
as
it
is
i
think
we
have
something
to
it
was
now
about
noon
the
noon
of
a
beautiful
october
day
of
the
north
the
air
like
life
itself
the
foliage
burning
red
on
the
hills
the
leaves
falling
softly
from
the
trees
as
the
wind
blew
but
bringing
with
them
no
hint
of
decay
none
of
the
vanguard
felt
fatigue
but
when
they
crossed
a
low
range
of
hills
and
saw
before
them
a
creek
flowing
down
to
the
susquehanna
henry
who
was
in
the
lead
stopped
suddenly
and
dropped
down
in
the
grass
the
others
knowing
without
question
the
significance
of
the
action
also
sank
down
is
it
henry
asked
sol
see
how
thick
the
trees
are
on
the
other
side
of
that
bank
look
a
little
to
the
left
of
a
big
oak
and
you
will
see
the
feathers
in
the
headdress
of
an
iroquois
farther
on
i
think
i
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
green
coat
and
if
i
am
right
that
coat
is
worn
by
one
of
royal
greens
it
an
ambush
sol
an
ambush
meant
for
it
not
an
ambush
intended
for
our
main
force
mynheer
henry
said
heemskerk
whose
red
face
began
to
grow
redder
with
the
desire
for
action
too
see
the
feather
of
the
good
scouts
and
skirmishers
it
our
duty
then
to
clear
this
force
out
of
the
way
and
not
wait
for
the
main
body
to
come
up
is
it
not
asked
henry
with
a
suggestive
look
at
the
dutchman
a
goot
head
you
have
mynheer
henry
exclaimed
heemskerk
course
we
will
fight
and
fight
now
about
them
blue
plates
said
sol
softly
but
heemskerk
did
not
hear
him
they
swiftly
developed
their
plan
of
action
there
could
be
no
earthly
doubt
of
the
fact
that
the
iroquois
and
some
tories
were
ambushed
on
the
far
side
of
the
creek
possibly
thayendanegea
himself
stung
by
the
burning
of
oghwaga
and
the
advance
on
cunahunta
was
there
but
they
were
sure
that
it
was
not
a
large
band
the
party
of
henry
and
heemskerk
numbered
fourteen
but
every
one
was
a
veteran
full
of
courage
tenacity
and
all
the
skill
of
the
woods
they
had
supreme
confidence
in
their
ability
to
beat
the
best
of
the
iroquois
man
for
man
and
they
carried
the
very
finest
arms
known
to
the
time
it
was
decided
that
four
of
the
men
should
remain
on
the
hill
the
others
including
the
five
heemskerk
and
taylor
would
make
a
circuit
cross
the
creek
a
full
mile
above
and
come
down
on
the
flank
of
the
ambushing
party
theirs
would
be
the
main
attack
but
it
would
be
preceded
by
sharpshooting
from
the
four
intended
to
absorb
the
attention
of
the
iroquois
the
chosen
ten
slipped
back
down
the
hill
and
as
soon
as
they
were
sheltered
from
any
possible
glimpse
by
the
warriors
they
rose
and
ran
rapidly
westward
before
they
had
gone
far
they
heard
the
crack
of
a
rifle
shot
then
another
then
several
from
another
point
as
if
in
reply
our
sharpshooters
said
henry
begun
to
disturb
the
iroquois
and
they
keep
them
we
break
in
on
their
sport
and
keep
them
still
busier
exclaimed
heemskerk
revolving
swiftly
through
the
bushes
his
face
blazing
red
it
did
not
take
long
for
such
as
they
to
go
the
mile
or
so
that
they
intended
and
then
they
crossed
the
creek
wading
in
the
water
breast
high
but
careful
to
keep
their
ammunition
dry
then
they
turned
and
rapidly
descended
the
stream
on
its
northern
bank
in
a
few
minutes
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
rifle
shot
and
then
of
another
as
if
replying
iroquois
have
been
fooled
exclaimed
heemskerk
four
good
riflemen
have
made
them
think
that
a
great
force
is
there
and
they
have
not
dared
to
cross
the
creek
themselves
and
make
an
in
a
few
minutes
more
as
they
ran
noiselessly
through
the
forest
they
saw
a
little
drifting
smoke
and
now
and
then
the
faint
flash
of
rifles
they
were
coming
somewhere
near
to
the
iroquois
band
and
they
practiced
exceeding
caution
presently
they
caught
sight
of
indian
faces
and
now
and
then
one
of
johnson
greens
or
butler
rangers
they
stopped
and
held
a
council
that
lasted
scarcely
more
than
half
a
minute
they
all
agreed
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
and
that
was
to
attack
in
the
indian
own
is
by
ambush
and
sharpshooting
henry
fired
the
first
shot
and
an
iroquois
aiming
at
a
foe
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
fell
heemskerk
quickly
followed
with
a
shot
as
good
and
the
surprised
iroquois
turned
to
face
this
new
foe
but
they
and
the
tories
were
a
strong
band
and
they
retreated
only
a
little
then
they
stood
firm
and
the
forest
battle
began
the
indians
numbered
not
less
than
thirty
and
both
braxton
wyatt
and
coleman
were
with
them
but
the
value
of
skill
was
here
shown
by
the
smaller
party
the
one
that
attacked
the
frontiersmen
trained
to
every
trick
and
wile
of
the
forest
and
marksmen
such
as
the
indians
were
never
able
to
become
continually
pressed
in
and
drove
the
iroquois
from
tree
to
tree
once
or
twice
the
warriors
started
a
rush
but
they
were
quickly
driven
back
by
sharpshooting
such
as
they
had
never
faced
before
they
soon
realized
that
this
was
no
band
of
border
farmers
armed
hastily
for
an
emergency
but
a
foe
who
knew
everything
that
they
knew
and
more
braxton
wyatt
and
his
friend
coleman
fought
with
the
iroquois
and
wyatt
in
particular
was
hot
with
rage
he
suspected
that
the
five
who
had
defeated
him
so
often
were
among
these
marksmen
and
there
might
be
a
chance
now
to
destroy
them
all
he
crept
to
the
side
of
the
fierce
old
seneca
chief
hiokatoo
and
suggested
that
a
part
of
their
band
slip
around
and
enfold
the
enemy
old
hiokatoo
in
the
thick
of
battle
now
presented
his
most
terrifying
aspect
he
was
naked
save
the
waist
cloth
his
great
body
was
covered
with
scars
and
as
he
bent
a
little
forward
he
held
cocked
and
ready
in
his
hands
a
fine
rifle
that
had
been
presented
to
him
by
his
good
friend
the
king
the
senecas
it
may
be
repeated
had
suffered
terribly
at
the
battle
of
the
oriskany
in
the
preceding
year
and
throughout
these
years
of
border
were
the
most
cruel
of
all
the
iroquois
in
this
respect
hiokatoo
led
all
the
senecas
and
now
braxton
wyatt
used
as
he
was
to
savage
scenes
was
compelled
to
admit
to
himself
that
this
was
the
most
terrifying
human
being
whom
he
had
ever
beheld
he
was
old
but
age
in
him
seemed
merely
to
add
to
his
strength
and
ferocity
the
path
of
a
deep
cut
healed
long
since
but
which
the
paint
even
did
not
hide
lay
across
his
forehead
others
almost
as
deep
adorned
his
right
cheek
his
chin
and
his
neck
he
was
crouched
much
like
a
panther
with
his
rifle
in
his
hands
and
the
ready
tomahawk
at
his
belt
but
it
was
the
extraordinary
expression
of
his
eyes
that
made
braxton
wyatt
shudder
he
read
there
no
mercy
for
anything
not
even
for
himself
braxton
wyatt
if
he
should
stand
in
the
way
and
it
was
this
last
fact
that
brought
the
shudder
hiokatoo
thought
it
a
good
plan
twenty
warriors
mostly
senecas
and
cayugas
were
detailed
to
execute
it
at
once
and
they
stole
off
toward
the
right
henry
had
suspected
some
such
diversion
and
as
he
had
been
joined
now
by
the
four
men
from
the
other
side
of
the
creek
he
disposed
his
little
force
to
meet
it
both
sol
and
heemskerk
had
caught
sight
of
figures
slipping
away
among
the
trees
and
henry
craftily
drew
back
a
little
while
two
or
three
men
maintained
the
sharpshooting
in
the
front
he
waited
for
the
attack
it
came
in
half
an
hour
the
flanking
force
making
a
savage
and
open
rush
but
the
fire
of
the
white
riflemen
was
so
swift
and
deadly
that
they
were
driven
back
again
but
they
had
come
very
near
and
a
tory
rushed
directly
at
young
taylor
the
tory
like
taylor
had
come
from
wyoming
and
he
had
been
one
of
the
most
ruthless
on
that
terrible
day
when
they
were
less
than
a
dozen
feet
apart
they
recognized
each
other
henry
saw
the
look
that
passed
between
them
and
although
he
held
a
loaded
rifle
in
his
hand
for
some
reason
he
did
not
use
it
the
tory
fired
a
pistol
at
taylor
but
the
bullet
missed
and
the
wyoming
youth
leaping
forth
swung
his
unloaded
rifle
and
brought
the
stock
down
with
all
his
force
upon
the
head
of
his
enemy
the
man
uttering
a
single
sound
a
sort
of
gasp
fell
dead
and
taylor
stood
over
him
still
trembling
with
rage
in
an
instant
henry
seized
him
and
dragged
him
down
and
then
a
seneca
bullet
whistled
where
he
had
been
was
one
of
the
worst
at
saw
him
exclaimed
young
taylor
still
trembling
all
over
with
passion
never
massacre
anybody
else
you
seen
to
that
said
henry
and
in
a
minute
or
two
taylor
was
quiet
the
sharpshooting
continued
but
here
as
elsewhere
the
iroquois
had
the
worst
of
it
despite
their
numbers
they
could
not
pass
nor
flank
that
line
of
deadly
marksmen
who
lay
behind
trees
almost
in
security
and
who
never
missed
another
tory
and
a
chief
also
were
killed
and
braxton
wyatt
was
daunted
nor
did
he
feel
any
better
when
old
hiokatoo
crept
to
his
side
have
failed
here
he
said
shoot
too
well
for
us
to
rush
them
we
have
lost
good
hiokatoo
frowned
and
the
scars
on
his
face
stood
out
in
livid
red
lines
is
so
he
said
who
fight
us
now
are
of
their
best
and
while
we
fight
the
army
that
destroyed
oghwaga
is
coming
up
come
we
will
the
little
white
band
soon
saw
that
the
indians
were
gone
from
their
front
they
scouted
some
distance
and
finding
no
enemy
hurried
back
to
colonel
butler
the
troops
were
pushed
forward
and
before
night
they
reached
cunahunta
which
they
burned
also
some
farther
advance
was
made
into
the
indian
country
and
more
destruction
was
done
but
now
the
winter
was
approaching
and
many
of
the
men
insisted
upon
returning
home
to
protect
their
families
others
were
to
rejoin
the
main
revolutionary
army
and
the
iroquois
campaign
was
to
stop
for
the
time
the
first
blow
had
been
struck
and
it
was
a
hard
one
but
the
second
blow
and
third
and
fourth
and
more
which
the
five
knew
were
so
badly
needed
must
wait
henry
and
his
comrades
were
deeply
disappointed
they
had
hoped
to
go
far
into
the
iroquois
country
to
break
the
power
of
the
six
nations
to
hunt
down
the
butlers
and
the
johnsons
and
brant
himself
but
they
could
not
wholly
blame
their
commander
the
rear
guard
or
rather
the
forest
guard
of
the
revolution
was
a
slender
and
small
force
indeed
henry
and
his
comrades
said
farewell
to
colonel
butler
with
much
personal
regret
and
also
to
the
gallant
troops
some
of
whom
were
morgan
riflemen
from
virginia
the
farewells
to
william
gray
bob
taylor
and
cornelius
heemskerk
were
more
intimate
think
we
see
more
of
one
another
in
other
campaigns
said
gray
be
on
the
battle
line
side
by
side
once
more
said
taylor
we
strike
another
blow
for
foresee
said
cornelius
heemskerk
i
a
peaceful
man
who
ought
to
be
painting
blue
plates
in
holland
will
be
drawn
into
danger
in
the
great
dark
wilderness
again
and
that
you
will
be
there
with
me
mynheer
henry
mynheer
paul
mynheer
the
wise
solomon
mynheer
the
silent
tom
and
mynheer
the
very
long
james
i
see
it
clearly
i
a
man
of
peace
am
always
being
pushed
in
to
hope
it
will
come
true
said
the
five
together
you
go
back
to
kentucky
asked
william
gray
replied
henry
speaking
for
them
all
have
entered
upon
this
task
here
and
we
are
going
to
stay
in
it
until
it
is
is
dangerous
the
most
dangerous
thing
in
the
world
said
heemskerk
still
have
my
foreknowledge
that
i
shall
stand
by
your
side
in
some
great
battle
to
come
but
the
first
thing
i
shall
do
when
i
see
you
again
my
friends
is
to
look
around
at
you
one
two
three
four
five
and
see
if
you
have
upon
your
heads
the
hair
which
is
now
so
rich
thick
and
fear
my
friend
said
henry
have
fought
with
the
warriors
all
the
way
from
the
susquehanna
to
new
orleans
and
not
one
of
us
has
lost
a
single
lock
of
is
one
dutchman
hope
that
it
will
always
be
so
said
heemskerk
and
then
he
revolved
rapidly
away
lest
they
see
his
face
express
emotion
the
five
received
great
supplies
of
powder
and
bullets
from
colonel
butler
and
then
they
parted
in
the
forest
many
of
the
soldiers
looked
back
and
saw
the
five
tall
figures
in
a
line
leaning
upon
the
muzzles
of
their
kentucky
rifles
and
regarding
them
in
silence
it
seemed
to
the
soldiers
that
they
had
left
behind
them
the
true
sons
of
the
wilderness
who
in
spite
of
all
dangers
would
be
there
to
welcome
them
when
they
returned
chapter
xvii
the
deserted
cabin
when
the
last
soldier
had
disappeared
among
the
trees
henry
turned
to
the
others
boys
he
asked
are
you
thinking
about
asked
paul
thinking
about
a
certain
place
i
know
a
sort
of
alcove
or
hole
in
a
cliff
above
a
me
said
sol
thinkin
how
fur
that
alcove
runs
back
an
how
it
could
be
fitted
up
with
furs
an
made
warm
fur
the
said
tom
ross
thinkin
what
a
snug
place
that
alcove
would
be
when
the
snow
an
hail
were
drivin
down
the
creek
in
front
of
ez
fur
me
said
long
jim
hart
wuz
thinkin
i
could
run
a
sort
uv
flue
from
the
back
part
uv
that
alcove
out
through
the
front
an
let
the
smoke
pass
out
i
could
cook
all
right
it
would
be
ez
good
a
place
fur
cookin
ez
the
one
we
hed
that
time
we
spent
the
winter
on
the
island
in
the
lake
but
strange
said
henry
i
been
thinking
of
all
the
things
that
all
four
of
you
have
been
thinking
about
and
since
we
are
agreed
we
are
bound
to
go
straight
to
alcove
and
pass
the
winter
without
another
word
he
led
the
way
and
the
others
followed
it
was
apparent
to
everyone
that
they
must
soon
find
a
winter
base
because
the
cold
had
increased
greatly
in
the
last
few
days
the
last
leaves
had
fallen
from
the
trees
and
a
searching
wind
howled
among
the
bare
branches
better
shelter
than
blankets
would
soon
be
needed
on
their
way
they
passed
oghwaga
a
mass
of
blackened
ruins
among
which
wolves
howled
the
same
spectacle
that
wyoming
now
afforded
although
oghwaga
had
not
been
stained
by
blood
it
was
a
long
journey
to
alcove
but
they
did
not
hurry
seeing
no
need
of
it
although
they
were
warned
of
the
wisdom
of
their
decision
by
the
fact
that
the
cold
was
increasing
the
country
in
which
the
lake
was
situated
lay
high
and
as
all
of
them
were
quite
sure
that
the
cold
was
going
to
be
great
there
they
thought
it
wise
to
make
preparations
against
it
which
they
discussed
as
they
walked
in
leisurely
fashion
through
the
woods
they
spoke
also
of
greater
things
all
felt
that
they
had
been
drawn
into
a
mightier
current
than
any
in
which
they
had
swam
before
they
fully
appreciated
the
importance
to
the
revolution
of
this
great
rearguard
struggle
and
at
present
they
did
not
have
the
remotest
idea
of
returning
to
kentucky
under
any
circumstances
got
to
fight
it
out
with
braxton
wyatt
and
the
iroquois
said
henry
heard
that
braxton
is
organizing
a
band
of
tories
of
his
own
and
that
he
is
likely
to
be
as
dangerous
as
either
of
the
day
we
end
him
for
good
an
all
said
sol
it
was
four
or
five
days
before
they
reached
their
alcove
and
now
all
the
forest
was
bare
and
apparently
lifeless
they
came
down
the
creek
and
found
their
boat
unharmed
and
untouched
still
among
the
foliage
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
one
thing
safe
said
long
jim
i
guess
we
find
alcove
all
right
a
wild
animal
has
taken
up
its
abode
there
said
paul
likely
replied
long
jim
left
the
human
smell
thar
an
even
after
all
this
time
it
likely
to
drive
away
any
prowlin
bear
or
panther
that
pokes
his
nose
long
jim
was
quite
right
their
snug
nest
like
that
of
a
squirrel
in
the
side
of
a
tree
had
not
been
disturbed
the
skins
which
they
had
rolled
up
tightly
and
placed
on
the
higher
shelves
of
stone
were
untouched
and
several
days
hunting
increased
the
supply
the
hunting
was
singularly
easy
and
although
the
five
did
not
know
it
the
quantity
of
game
was
much
greater
in
that
region
than
it
had
been
for
years
it
had
been
swept
of
human
beings
by
the
iroquois
and
tory
hordes
and
deer
bear
and
panther
seemed
to
know
instinctively
that
the
woods
were
once
more
safe
for
them
in
their
hunting
they
came
upon
the
ruins
of
charred
houses
and
more
than
once
they
saw
something
among
the
coals
that
caused
them
to
turn
away
with
a
shudder
at
every
place
where
man
had
made
a
little
opening
the
wilderness
was
quickly
reclaiming
its
own
again
next
year
the
grass
and
the
foliage
would
cover
up
the
coals
and
the
hideous
relics
that
lay
among
them
they
jerked
great
quantities
of
venison
on
the
trees
on
the
cliff
side
and
stored
it
in
they
also
cured
some
bear
meat
and
having
added
a
further
lining
of
skins
they
felt
prepared
for
winter
they
had
also
added
to
the
comfort
of
the
place
they
had
taken
the
precaution
of
bringing
with
them
two
axes
and
with
the
heads
of
these
they
smoothed
out
more
of
the
rough
places
on
the
floor
and
sides
of
they
thought
it
likely
too
that
they
would
need
the
axes
in
other
ways
later
on
only
once
during
these
arrangements
did
they
pass
the
trail
of
indians
and
that
was
made
by
a
party
of
about
twenty
at
least
ten
miles
from
they
seemed
to
be
traveling
north
and
the
five
made
no
investigations
somewhat
later
they
met
a
white
runner
in
the
forest
and
he
told
them
of
the
terrible
massacre
of
cherry
valley
walter
butler
emulating
his
father
exploit
at
wyoming
had
come
down
with
a
mixed
horde
of
iroquois
tories
british
and
canadians
he
had
not
been
wholly
successful
but
he
had
slaughtered
half
a
hundred
women
and
children
and
was
now
returning
northward
with
prisoners
some
said
according
to
the
runner
that
thayendanegea
had
led
the
indians
on
this
occasion
but
as
the
five
learned
later
he
had
not
come
up
until
the
massacre
was
over
the
runner
added
another
piece
of
information
that
interested
them
deeply
butler
had
been
accompanied
to
cherry
valley
by
a
young
tory
or
renegade
named
wyatt
who
had
distinguished
himself
by
cunning
and
cruelty
it
was
said
that
wyatt
had
built
up
for
himself
a
command
and
was
becoming
a
great
scourge
our
braxton
said
henry
is
rising
to
his
opportunities
he
is
likely
to
become
fully
the
equal
of
walter
but
they
could
do
nothing
at
present
to
find
wyatt
and
they
went
somewhat
sadly
back
to
they
had
learned
also
from
the
runner
that
wyatt
had
a
lieutenant
a
tory
named
coleman
and
this
fact
increased
their
belief
that
wyatt
was
undertaking
to
operate
on
a
large
scale
may
get
a
chance
at
him
anyhow
said
henry
and
his
band
may
go
too
far
away
from
the
main
body
of
the
indians
and
tories
and
in
that
case
we
can
strike
a
blow
if
we
are
every
one
of
the
five
although
none
of
them
knew
it
received
an
additional
impulse
from
this
news
about
braxton
wyatt
he
had
grown
up
with
them
loyalty
to
the
king
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
becoming
a
renegade
or
a
tory
he
could
not
plead
lost
lands
or
exile
for
taking
part
in
such
massacres
as
wyoming
or
cherry
valley
but
long
since
an
ally
of
the
indians
he
was
now
at
the
head
of
a
tory
band
that
murdered
and
burned
from
sheer
pleasure
day
we
get
him
as
shore
as
the
sun
rises
an
sets
said
sol
repeating
henry
prediction
but
for
the
present
they
up
and
now
their
foresight
was
justified
to
such
as
they
used
to
the
hardships
of
forest
life
was
a
cheery
nest
from
its
door
they
watched
the
wild
fowl
streaming
south
pigeons
ducks
and
others
outlined
against
the
dark
wintry
skies
so
numerous
were
these
flocks
that
there
was
scarcely
a
time
when
they
did
not
see
one
passing
toward
the
warm
south
sol
and
paul
sat
together
watching
a
great
flock
of
wild
geese
arrow
shaped
and
flying
at
almost
incredible
speed
a
few
faint
honks
came
to
them
and
then
the
geese
grew
misty
on
the
horizon
sol
followed
them
with
serious
eyes
you
ever
think
paul
he
said
we
human
bein
ai
so
mighty
ez
we
think
we
are
we
kin
walk
on
the
groun
an
by
hard
learnin
an
hard
work
we
kin
paddle
through
the
water
a
little
but
jest
look
at
them
geese
flyin
a
mile
high
right
over
everything
rivers
forests
any
mountains
makin
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
almost
without
flappin
a
wing
then
they
kin
come
down
on
the
water
an
float
fur
hours
without
bein
tired
an
they
kin
waddle
along
on
the
groun
too
did
you
ever
hear
of
any
men
who
had
so
many
why
paul
you
an
me
could
grow
wings
all
at
once
an
go
through
the
air
a
mile
a
minute
fur
a
month
an
never
git
certainly
see
some
great
sights
said
paul
do
you
know
sol
what
would
be
the
first
thing
i
do
if
i
had
the
gift
of
tireless
wings
off
to
them
other
continents
i
heard
you
tell
i
swoop
along
over
the
forests
up
here
until
i
picked
out
all
the
camps
of
the
indians
and
tories
i
pick
out
the
butlers
and
braxton
wyatt
and
coleman
and
see
what
mischief
they
were
planning
then
fly
away
to
the
east
and
look
down
at
all
the
armies
ours
in
buff
and
blue
and
the
british
redcoats
i
look
into
the
face
of
our
great
then
i
fly
away
back
into
the
west
and
south
and
i
hover
over
wareville
i
see
our
own
people
every
last
little
one
of
them
they
might
take
a
shot
at
me
not
knowing
who
i
was
but
be
so
high
up
in
the
air
no
bullet
could
reach
me
then
i
come
soaring
back
here
to
you
would
shorely
be
a
grand
trip
paul
said
sol
i
would
mind
takin
it
in
myself
but
fur
the
present
we
better
busy
our
minds
with
the
warnin
the
wild
fowl
are
givin
us
though
well
fixed
fur
a
house
already
it
what
good
homes
a
handy
man
kin
find
in
the
the
predictions
of
the
wild
fowl
were
true
a
few
days
later
heavy
clouds
rolled
up
in
the
southwest
and
the
five
watched
them
knowing
what
they
would
bring
them
they
spread
to
the
zenith
and
then
to
the
other
horizon
clothing
the
whole
circle
of
the
earth
the
great
flakes
began
to
drop
down
slowly
at
first
then
faster
soon
all
the
trees
were
covered
with
white
and
everything
else
too
except
the
dark
surface
of
the
lake
which
received
the
flakes
into
its
bosom
as
they
fell
it
snowed
all
that
day
and
most
of
the
next
until
it
lay
about
two
feet
on
the
ground
after
that
it
turned
intensely
cold
the
surface
of
the
snow
froze
and
ice
nearly
a
foot
thick
covered
the
lake
it
was
not
possible
to
travel
under
such
circumstances
without
artificial
help
and
now
tom
ross
who
had
once
hunted
in
the
far
north
came
to
their
help
he
showed
them
how
to
make
snowshoes
and
although
all
learned
to
use
them
henry
with
his
great
strength
and
peculiar
skill
became
by
far
the
most
expert
as
the
snow
with
its
frozen
surface
lay
on
the
ground
for
weeks
henry
took
many
long
journeys
on
the
snowshoes
sometimes
be
hunted
but
oftener
his
role
was
that
of
scout
he
cautioned
his
friends
that
he
might
be
or
four
days
at
a
time
and
that
they
need
take
no
alarm
about
him
unless
his
absence
became
extremely
long
the
winter
deepened
the
snow
melted
and
another
and
greater
storm
came
freezing
the
surface
again
making
the
snowshoes
necessary
henry
decided
now
to
take
a
scout
alone
to
the
northward
and
as
the
others
bad
long
since
grown
into
the
habit
of
accepting
his
decisions
almost
without
question
he
started
at
once
he
was
well
equipped
with
his
rifle
double
barreled
pistol
hatchet
and
knife
and
he
carried
in
addition
a
heavy
blanket
and
some
jerked
venison
he
put
on
his
snowshoes
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
waved
a
farewell
to
the
four
heads
thrust
from
above
and
struck
out
on
the
smooth
icy
surface
of
the
creek
from
this
he
presently
passed
into
the
woods
and
for
a
long
time
pursued
a
course
almost
due
north
it
was
no
vague
theory
that
had
drawn
henry
forth
in
one
of
his
journeyings
be
had
met
a
hunter
who
told
him
of
a
band
of
tories
and
indians
encamped
toward
the
north
and
he
had
an
idea
that
it
was
the
party
led
by
braxton
wyatt
now
he
meant
to
see
his
information
was
very
indefinite
and
he
began
to
discover
signs
much
earlier
than
he
had
expected
before
the
end
of
the
first
day
he
saw
the
traces
of
other
snowshoe
runners
on
the
icy
snow
and
once
he
came
to
a
place
where
a
deer
had
been
slain
and
dressed
then
he
came
to
another
where
the
snow
had
been
hollowed
out
under
some
pines
to
make
a
sleeping
place
for
several
men
clearly
he
was
in
the
land
of
the
enemy
again
and
a
large
and
hostile
camp
might
be
somewhere
near
henry
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
when
he
saw
these
indications
all
the
primitive
instincts
leaped
up
within
him
a
child
of
the
forest
and
of
elemental
conditions
the
warlike
instinct
was
strong
within
him
he
was
tired
of
hunting
wild
animals
and
now
there
was
promise
of
a
more
dangerous
foe
for
the
purposes
that
he
had
in
view
he
was
glad
that
he
was
alone
the
wintry
forest
with
its
two
feet
of
snow
covered
with
ice
contained
no
terrors
for
him
he
moved
on
his
snowshoes
almost
like
a
skater
and
with
all
the
dexterity
of
an
indian
of
the
far
north
who
is
practically
born
on
such
shoes
as
he
stood
upon
the
brow
of
a
little
hill
elevated
upon
his
snowshoes
he
was
indeed
a
wonderful
figure
the
added
height
and
the
white
glare
from
the
ice
made
him
tower
like
a
great
giant
he
was
clad
completely
in
soft
warm
deerskin
his
hands
were
gloved
in
the
same
material
and
the
fur
cap
was
drawn
tightly
about
his
head
and
ears
the
rifle
lay
across
his
shoulder
and
the
blanket
and
deer
meat
made
a
light
package
on
his
back
only
his
face
was
uncovered
and
that
was
rosy
with
the
sharp
but
bracing
cold
but
the
resolute
blue
eyes
seemed
to
have
grown
more
resolute
in
the
last
six
months
and
the
firm
jaw
was
firmer
than
ever
it
was
a
steely
blue
sky
clear
hard
and
cold
fitted
to
the
earth
of
snow
and
ice
that
it
inclosed
his
eyes
traveled
the
circle
of
the
horizon
three
times
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
circle
he
made
out
a
dim
dark
thread
against
that
sheet
of
blue
steel
it
was
the
light
of
a
camp
fire
and
that
camp
fire
must
belong
to
an
enemy
it
was
not
likely
that
anybody
else
would
be
sending
forth
such
a
signal
in
this
wintry
wilderness
henry
judged
that
the
fire
was
several
miles
away
and
apparently
in
a
small
valley
hemmed
in
by
hills
of
moderate
height
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
band
of
braxton
wyatt
was
there
and
he
intended
to
make
a
thorough
scout
about
it
he
advanced
until
the
smoke
line
became
much
thicker
and
broader
and
then
he
stopped
in
the
densest
clump
of
bushes
that
he
could
find
he
meant
to
remain
there
until
darkness
came
because
with
all
foliage
gone
from
the
forest
it
would
be
impossible
to
examine
the
hostile
camp
by
day
the
bushes
despite
the
lack
of
leaves
were
so
dense
that
they
hid
him
well
and
breaking
through
the
crust
of
ice
he
dug
a
hole
then
having
taken
off
his
snowshoes
and
wrapped
his
blanket
about
his
body
he
thrust
himself
into
the
hole
exactly
like
a
rabbit
in
its
burrow
he
laid
his
shoes
on
the
crust
of
ice
beside
him
of
course
if
found
there
by
a
large
party
of
warriors
on
snowshoes
he
would
have
no
chance
to
flee
but
he
was
willing
to
take
what
seemed
to
him
a
small
risk
the
dark
would
not
be
long
in
coming
and
it
was
snug
and
warm
in
the
hole
as
he
sat
his
head
rose
just
above
the
surrounding
ice
but
his
rifle
barrel
rose
much
higher
he
ate
a
little
venison
for
supper
and
the
weariness
in
the
ankles
that
comes
from
long
traveling
on
snowshoes
disappeared
he
could
not
see
outside
the
bushes
but
he
listened
with
those
uncommonly
keen
ears
of
his
no
sound
at
all
came
there
was
not
even
a
wind
to
rustle
the
bare
boughs
the
sun
hung
a
huge
red
globe
in
the
west
and
all
that
side
of
the
earth
was
tinged
with
a
red
glare
wintry
and
cold
despite
its
redness
then
as
the
earth
turned
the
sun
was
lost
behind
it
and
the
cold
dark
came
henry
found
it
so
comfortable
in
his
burrow
that
all
his
muscles
were
soothed
and
he
grew
sleepy
it
would
have
been
very
pleasant
to
doze
there
but
he
brought
himself
round
with
an
effort
of
the
will
and
became
as
wide
awake
as
ever
he
was
eager
to
be
off
on
his
expedition
but
he
knew
how
much
depended
on
waiting
and
he
waited
one
hour
two
hours
three
hours
four
hours
still
and
dark
passed
in
the
forest
before
he
roused
himself
from
his
covert
then
warm
strong
and
tempered
like
steel
for
his
purpose
he
put
on
his
snowshoes
and
advanced
toward
the
point
from
which
the
column
of
smoke
had
risen
he
had
never
been
more
cautious
and
wary
than
he
was
now
he
was
a
formidable
figure
in
the
darkness
crouched
forward
and
moving
like
some
spirit
of
the
wilderness
half
walking
half
gliding
although
the
night
had
come
out
rather
clear
with
many
cold
stars
twinkling
in
the
blue
the
line
of
smoke
was
no
longer
visible
but
henry
did
not
expect
it
to
be
nor
did
he
need
it
he
had
marked
its
base
too
clearly
in
his
mind
to
make
any
mistake
and
he
advanced
with
certainty
he
came
presently
into
an
open
space
and
he
stopped
with
amazement
around
him
were
the
stumps
of
a
clearing
made
recently
and
near
him
were
some
yards
of
rough
rail
fence
he
crouched
against
the
fence
and
saw
on
the
far
side
of
the
clearing
the
dim
outlines
of
several
buildings
from
the
chimneys
of
two
of
which
smoke
was
rising
it
was
his
first
thought
that
he
had
come
upon
a
little
settlement
still
held
by
daring
borderers
but
second
thought
told
him
that
it
was
impossible
another
and
more
comprehensive
look
showed
many
signs
of
ruin
he
saw
remains
of
several
burned
houses
but
clothing
all
was
the
atmosphere
of
desolation
and
decay
that
tells
when
a
place
is
abandoned
the
two
threads
of
smoke
did
not
alter
this
impression
henry
divined
it
all
the
builders
of
this
tiny
village
in
the
wilderness
bad
been
massacred
or
driven
away
a
part
of
the
houses
had
been
destroyed
some
were
left
standing
and
now
there
were
visitors
he
advanced
without
noise
keeping
behind
the
rail
fence
and
approaching
one
of
the
houses
from
the
chimneys
of
which
the
smoke
came
here
be
crouched
a
long
time
looking
and
listening
attentively
but
it
seemed
that
the
visitors
had
no
fears
why
should
they
when
there
was
nothing
that
they
need
fear
in
this
frozen
wilderness
henry
stole
a
little
nearer
it
had
been
a
snug
trim
little
settlement
perhaps
or
thirty
people
had
lived
there
literally
hewing
a
home
out
of
the
forest
his
heart
throbbed
with
a
fierce
hatred
and
anger
against
those
who
had
spoiled
all
this
and
his
gloved
finger
crept
to
the
hammer
of
his
rifle
the
night
was
intensely
cold
the
mercury
was
far
below
zero
and
a
wind
that
had
begun
to
rise
cut
like
the
edge
of
a
knife
even
the
wariest
of
indians
in
such
desolate
weather
might
fail
to
keep
a
watch
but
henry
did
not
suffer
the
fur
cap
was
drawn
farther
over
chin
and
ears
and
the
buckskin
gloves
kept
his
fingers
warm
and
flexible
besides
his
blood
was
uncommonly
hot
in
his
veins
his
comprehensive
eye
told
him
that
while
some
of
the
buildings
had
not
been
destroyed
they
were
so
ravaged
and
damaged
that
they
could
never
be
used
again
save
as
a
passing
shelter
just
as
they
were
being
used
now
he
slid
cautiously
about
the
desolate
place
he
crossed
a
brook
frozen
almost
solidly
in
its
bed
and
he
saw
two
or
three
large
mounds
that
had
been
haystacks
now
covered
with
snow
then
he
slid
without
noise
back
to
the
nearest
of
the
houses
from
which
the
smoke
came
it
was
rather
more
pretentious
than
the
others
built
of
planks
instead
of
logs
and
with
shingles
for
a
roof
the
remains
of
a
small
portico
formed
the
approach
to
the
front
door
henry
supposed
that
the
house
had
been
set
on
fire
and
that
perhaps
a
heavy
rain
had
saved
a
part
of
it
a
bar
of
light
falling
across
the
snow
attracted
his
attention
he
knew
that
it
was
the
glow
of
a
fire
within
coming
through
a
window
a
faint
sound
of
voices
reached
his
ears
and
he
moved
forward
slowly
to
the
window
it
was
an
oaken
shutter
originally
fastened
with
a
leather
strap
but
the
strap
was
gone
and
now
some
one
had
tied
it
though
not
tightly
with
a
deer
tendon
the
crack
between
shutter
and
wall
was
at
least
three
inches
and
henry
could
see
within
very
well
he
pressed
his
side
tightly
to
the
wall
and
put
his
eyes
to
the
crevice
what
he
saw
within
did
not
still
any
of
those
primitive
feelings
that
had
risen
so
strongly
in
his
breast
a
great
fire
had
been
built
in
the
log
fireplace
but
it
was
burning
somewhat
low
now
having
reached
that
mellow
period
of
least
crackling
and
greatest
heat
the
huge
bed
of
coals
threw
a
mass
of
varied
and
glowing
colors
across
the
floor
large
holes
had
been
burned
in
the
side
of
the
room
by
the
original
fire
but
indian
blankets
had
been
fastened
tightly
over
them
in
front
of
the
fire
sat
braxton
wyatt
in
a
loyalist
uniform
a
hat
cocked
proudly
on
his
head
and
a
small
sword
by
his
side
he
had
grown
heavier
and
henry
saw
that
the
face
had
increased
much
in
coarseness
and
cruelty
it
had
also
increased
in
satisfaction
he
was
a
great
man
now
as
he
saw
great
men
and
both
face
and
figure
radiated
gratification
and
pride
as
he
lolled
before
the
fire
at
the
other
corner
sitting
upon
the
floor
and
also
in
a
loyalist
uniform
was
his
lieutenant
levi
coleman
older
heavier
and
with
a
short
uncommonly
muscular
figure
his
face
was
dark
and
cruel
with
small
eyes
set
close
together
a
half
dozen
other
white
men
and
more
than
a
dozen
indians
were
in
the
room
all
these
lay
upon
their
blankets
on
the
floor
because
all
the
furniture
had
been
destroyed
yet
they
had
eaten
and
they
lay
there
content
in
the
soothing
glow
of
the
fire
like
animals
that
had
fed
well
henry
was
so
near
that
he
could
hear
every
word
anyone
spoke
was
well
that
the
indians
led
us
to
this
place
eh
levi
said
wyatt
glad
the
fire
spared
a
part
of
it
said
coleman
as
if
it
was
done
just
for
us
to
give
us
a
shelter
some
cold
winter
night
when
we
come
along
i
guess
the
iroquois
aieroski
is
watching
over
wyatt
laughed
a
man
that
i
like
levi
he
said
can
see
to
the
inside
of
things
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
use
this
place
as
a
base
and
shelter
and
make
a
raid
on
some
of
the
settlements
east
of
the
hills
eh
levi
could
be
done
said
coleman
just
listen
to
that
wind
will
you
on
a
night
like
this
it
must
cut
like
a
saber
edge
even
our
iroquois
are
glad
to
be
under
a
henry
still
gazed
in
at
the
crack
with
eyes
that
were
lighted
up
by
an
angry
fire
so
here
was
more
talk
of
destruction
and
slaughter
his
gaze
alighted
upon
an
indian
who
sat
in
a
corner
engaged
upon
a
task
henry
looked
more
closely
and
saw
that
he
was
stretching
a
scalp
over
a
small
hoop
a
shudder
shook
his
whole
frame
only
those
who
lived
amid
such
scenes
could
understand
the
intensity
of
his
feelings
he
felt
too
a
bitter
sense
of
injustice
the
doers
of
these
deeds
were
here
in
warmth
and
comfort
while
the
innocent
were
dead
or
fugitives
he
turned
away
from
the
window
stepping
gently
upon
the
snowshoes
he
inferred
that
the
remainder
of
wyatt
band
were
quartered
in
the
other
house
from
which
he
had
seen
the
smoke
rising
it
was
about
twenty
rods
away
but
he
did
not
examine
it
because
a
great
idea
had
been
born
suddenly
in
his
brain
the
attempt
to
fulfill
the
idea
would
be
accompanied
by
extreme
danger
but
he
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
he
stole
gently
to
one
of
the
outhouses
and
went
inside
here
he
found
what
he
wanted
a
large
pine
shelf
that
had
been
sheltered
from
rain
and
that
was
perfectly
dry
he
scraped
off
a
large
quantity
of
the
dry
pine
until
it
formed
almost
a
dust
and
he
did
not
cease
until
he
had
filled
his
cap
with
it
then
he
cut
off
large
splinters
until
he
had
accumulated
a
great
number
and
after
that
he
gathered
smaller
pieces
of
pine
he
was
fully
two
hours
doing
this
work
and
the
night
advanced
far
but
he
never
faltered
his
head
was
bare
but
he
was
protected
from
the
wind
by
a
fragment
of
the
outhouse
wall
every
two
or
three
minutes
he
stopped
and
listened
for
the
sound
of
a
creaking
sliding
footstep
on
the
snow
but
never
hearing
any
he
always
resumed
his
work
with
the
same
concentration
all
the
while
the
wind
rose
and
moaned
through
the
ruins
of
the
little
village
when
henry
chanced
to
raise
his
head
above
the
sheltering
wall
it
was
like
the
slash
of
a
knife
across
his
cheek
finally
he
took
half
of
the
pine
dust
in
his
cap
and
a
lot
of
the
splinters
under
his
arm
and
stole
back
to
the
house
from
which
the
light
had
shone
he
looked
again
through
the
crevice
at
the
window
the
light
had
died
down
much
more
and
both
wyatt
and
coleman
were
asleep
on
the
floor
but
several
of
the
iroquois
were
awake
although
they
sat
as
silent
and
motionless
as
stones
against
the
wall
henry
moved
from
the
window
and
selected
a
sheltered
spot
beside
the
plank
wall
there
he
put
the
pine
dust
in
a
little
heap
on
the
snow
and
covered
it
over
with
pine
splinters
on
top
of
which
he
put
larger
pieces
of
pine
then
he
went
back
for
the
remainder
of
the
pine
dust
and
built
a
similar
pyramid
against
a
sheltered
side
of
the
second
house
the
most
delicate
part
of
his
task
had
now
come
one
that
good
fortune
only
could
aid
him
in
achieving
but
the
brave
youth
his
heart
aflame
with
righteous
anger
against
those
inside
still
pursued
the
work
his
heart
throbbed
but
hand
and
eye
were
steady
now
came
the
kindly
stroke
of
fortune
for
which
he
had
hoped
the
wind
rose
much
higher
and
roared
harder
against
the
house
it
would
prevent
the
iroquois
within
keen
of
ear
as
they
were
from
hearing
a
light
sound
without
then
he
drew
forth
his
flint
and
steel
and
struck
them
together
with
a
hand
so
strong
and
swift
that
sparks
quickly
leaped
forth
and
set
fire
to
the
pine
tinder
henry
paused
only
long
enough
to
see
the
flame
spread
to
the
splinters
and
then
he
ran
rapidly
to
the
other
house
where
the
task
was
intended
that
his
job
should
be
thorough
pursuing
this
resolve
to
make
his
task
complete
he
came
back
to
the
first
house
and
looked
at
his
fire
it
had
already
spread
to
the
larger
pieces
of
pine
and
it
could
not
go
out
now
the
sound
made
by
the
flames
blended
exactly
with
the
roaring
of
the
wind
and
another
minute
or
two
might
pass
before
the
iroquois
detected
it
now
his
heart
throbbed
again
and
exultation
was
mingled
with
his
anger
by
the
time
the
iroquois
were
aroused
to
the
danger
the
flames
would
be
so
high
that
the
wind
would
reach
them
then
no
one
could
put
them
out
it
might
have
been
safer
for
him
to
flee
deep
into
the
forest
at
once
but
that
lingering
desire
to
make
his
task
complete
and
also
the
wish
to
see
the
result
kept
him
from
doing
it
he
merely
walked
across
the
open
space
and
stood
behind
a
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
braxton
wyatt
and
his
tories
and
iroquois
were
very
warm
very
snug
in
the
shelter
of
the
old
house
with
the
great
bed
of
coals
before
them
they
may
even
have
been
dreaming
peaceful
and
beautiful
dreams
when
suddenly
an
iroquois
sprang
to
his
feet
and
uttered
a
cry
that
awoke
all
the
rest
smell
smoke
he
exclaimed
in
his
tongue
there
is
fire
too
i
hear
it
crackle
outside
braxton
wyatt
ran
to
the
window
and
jerked
it
open
flame
and
smoke
blew
in
his
face
he
uttered
an
angry
cry
and
snatched
at
the
pistol
in
his
belt
whole
side
of
the
house
is
on
fire
he
exclaimed
neglect
has
done
this
coleman
shrewd
and
observing
was
at
his
elbow
fire
was
set
on
the
outside
he
said
was
no
carelessness
of
our
men
some
enemy
has
done
this
is
true
exclaimed
wyatt
furiously
everybody
the
house
burns
fast
there
was
a
rush
for
the
door
already
ashes
and
cinders
were
falling
about
their
heads
flames
leaped
high
were
caught
by
the
roaring
winds
and
roared
with
them
the
shell
of
the
house
would
soon
be
gone
and
when
tories
and
iroquois
were
outside
they
saw
the
remainder
of
their
band
pouring
forth
from
the
other
house
which
was
also
in
flames
no
means
of
theirs
could
stop
so
great
a
fire
and
they
stood
in
a
sort
of
stupefaction
watching
it
as
it
was
fanned
to
greatest
heights
by
the
wind
all
the
remaining
outbuildings
caught
also
and
in
a
few
moments
nothing
whatever
would
be
left
of
the
tiny
village
braxton
wyatt
and
his
band
must
lie
in
the
icy
wilderness
and
they
could
never
use
this
place
as
a
basis
for
attack
upon
settlements
under
the
sun
could
it
have
happened
exclaimed
wyatt
did
happen
it
was
done
said
coleman
set
these
houses
on
fire
while
we
slept
within
hark
to
that
an
iroquois
some
distance
from
the
houses
was
bending
over
the
snow
where
it
was
not
yet
melted
by
the
heat
he
saw
there
the
track
of
snowshoes
and
suddenly
looking
toward
the
forest
whither
they
led
he
saw
a
dark
figure
flit
away
among
the
trees

henry
slide
henry
ware
lingering
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
his
body
hidden
behind
one
of
the
great
tree
trunks
had
been
watching
the
scene
with
a
fascinated
interest
that
would
not
let
him
go
he
knew
that
his
work
there
was
done
already
everything
would
be
utterly
destroyed
by
the
flames
which
driven
by
the
wind
leaped
from
one
building
to
another
braxton
wyatt
and
his
band
would
have
enough
to
do
sheltering
themselves
from
the
fierce
winter
and
the
settlements
could
rest
for
a
while
at
least
undeniably
he
felt
exultation
as
he
witnessed
the
destructive
work
of
his
hand
the
border
with
its
constant
struggle
and
terrible
deeds
bred
fierce
passions
in
truth
although
he
did
not
know
it
himself
he
stayed
there
to
please
his
eye
and
heart
a
new
pulse
beat
triumphantly
every
time
a
timber
burned
through
fell
in
or
a
crash
came
from
a
falling
roof
he
laughed
inwardly
as
the
flames
disclosed
the
dismay
on
the
faces
of
the
iroquois
and
tories
and
it
gave
him
deep
satisfaction
to
see
braxton
wyatt
his
gaudy
little
sword
at
his
thigh
stalking
about
helpless
it
was
while
he
was
looking
absorbed
in
such
feelings
that
the
warrior
of
the
alert
eye
saw
him
and
gave
the
warning
shout
henry
turned
in
an
instant
and
darted
away
among
the
trees
half
running
half
sliding
over
the
smooth
icy
covering
of
the
snow
after
him
came
warriors
and
some
tories
who
had
put
on
their
snowshoes
preparatory
to
the
search
through
the
forest
for
shelter
several
bullets
were
fired
but
he
was
too
far
away
for
a
good
aim
he
heard
one
go
zip
against
a
tree
and
another
cut
the
surface
of
the
ice
near
him
but
none
touched
him
and
he
sped
easily
on
his
snowshoes
through
the
frozen
forest
but
henry
was
fully
aware
of
one
thing
that
constituted
his
greatest
danger
many
of
these
iroquois
had
been
trained
all
their
lives
to
snowshoes
while
he
however
powerful
and
agile
was
comparatively
a
beginner
he
glanced
back
again
and
saw
their
dusky
figures
running
among
the
trees
but
they
did
not
seem
to
be
gaining
if
one
should
draw
too
near
there
was
his
rifle
and
no
man
white
or
red
in
the
northern
or
southern
forests
could
use
it
better
but
for
the
present
it
was
not
needed
he
pressed
it
closely
almost
lovingly
to
his
side
this
best
friend
of
the
scout
and
frontiersman
he
had
chosen
his
course
at
the
first
leap
it
was
southward
toward
the
lake
and
he
did
not
make
the
mistake
of
diverging
from
his
line
knowing
that
some
part
of
the
wide
half
circle
of
his
pursuers
would
profit
by
it
henry
felt
a
great
upward
surge
he
had
been
the
victor
in
what
he
meant
to
achieve
and
he
was
sure
that
he
would
escape
the
cold
wind
whistling
by
whipped
his
blood
and
added
new
strength
to
his
great
muscles
his
ankles
were
not
chafed
or
sore
and
he
sped
forward
on
the
snowshoes
straight
and
true
whenever
he
came
to
a
hill
the
pursuers
would
gain
as
he
went
up
it
but
when
he
went
down
the
other
side
it
was
he
who
gained
he
passed
brooks
creeks
and
once
a
small
river
but
they
were
frozen
over
many
inches
deep
and
he
did
not
notice
them
again
it
was
a
lake
a
mile
wide
but
the
smooth
surface
there
merely
increased
his
speed
always
he
kept
a
wary
look
ahead
for
thickets
through
which
he
could
not
pass
easily
and
once
he
sent
back
a
shout
of
defiance
which
the
iroquois
answered
with
a
yell
of
anger
he
was
fully
aware
that
any
accident
to
his
snowshoes
would
prove
fatal
the
slipping
of
the
thongs
on
his
ankles
or
the
breaking
of
a
runner
would
end
his
flight
and
in
a
long
chase
such
an
accident
might
happen
it
might
happen
too
to
one
or
more
of
the
iroquois
but
plenty
of
them
would
be
left
yet
henry
had
supreme
confidence
in
his
snowshoes
he
had
made
them
himself
he
had
seen
that
every
part
was
good
and
every
thong
had
been
fastened
with
care
the
wind
which
bad
been
roaring
so
loudly
at
the
time
of
the
fire
sank
to
nothing
the
leafless
trees
stood
up
the
branches
unmoving
the
forest
was
bare
and
deserted
all
the
animals
big
and
little
had
gone
into
their
lairs
nobody
witnessed
the
great
pursuit
save
pursuers
and
pursued
henry
kept
his
direction
clear
in
his
mind
and
allowed
the
iroquois
to
take
no
advantage
of
a
curve
save
once
then
he
came
to
a
thicket
so
large
that
he
was
compelled
to
make
a
considerable
circle
to
pass
it
he
turned
to
the
right
hence
the
indians
on
the
right
gained
and
they
sent
up
a
yell
of
delight
he
replied
defiantly
and
increased
his
speed
but
one
of
the
indians
a
flying
mohawk
had
come
dangerously
enough
in
fact
to
fire
a
bullet
that
did
not
miss
the
fugitive
much
it
aroused
henry
anger
he
took
it
as
an
indignity
rather
than
a
danger
and
he
resolved
to
avenge
it
so
far
as
firing
was
concerned
he
was
at
a
disadvantage
he
must
stop
and
turn
around
for
his
shot
while
the
iroquois
without
even
checking
speed
could
fire
straight
at
the
flying
target
ahead
nevertheless
he
took
the
chance
he
turned
deftly
on
the
snowshoes
fired
as
quick
as
lightning
at
the
swift
mohawk
saw
him
fall
then
whirled
and
resumed
his
flight
he
had
lost
ground
but
he
had
inspired
respect
a
single
man
could
not
afford
to
come
too
near
to
a
marksman
so
deadly
and
the
three
or
four
who
led
dropped
back
with
the
main
body
now
henry
made
his
greatest
effort
he
wished
to
leave
the
foe
far
behind
to
shake
off
his
pursuit
entirely
he
bounded
over
the
ice
and
snow
with
great
leaps
and
began
to
gain
yet
he
felt
at
last
the
effects
of
so
strenuous
a
flight
his
breath
became
shorter
despite
the
intense
cold
perspiration
stood
upon
his
face
and
the
straps
that
fastened
the
snowshoes
were
chafing
his
ankles
an
end
must
come
even
to
such
strength
as
his
another
backward
look
and
he
saw
that
the
foe
was
sinking
into
the
darkness
if
he
could
only
increase
his
speed
again
he
might
leave
the
iroquois
now
he
made
a
new
call
upon
the
will
and
the
body
responded
for
a
few
minutes
his
speed
became
greater
a
disappointed
shout
arose
behind
him
and
several
shots
were
fired
but
the
bullets
fell
a
hundred
yards
short
and
then
as
he
passed
over
a
little
hill
and
into
a
wood
beyond
he
was
hidden
from
the
sight
of
his
pursuers
henry
knew
that
the
iroquois
could
trail
him
over
the
snow
but
they
could
not
do
it
at
full
speed
and
he
turned
sharply
off
at
an
angle
pausing
a
second
or
two
for
fresh
breath
he
continued
on
his
new
course
although
not
so
fast
as
before
he
knew
that
the
iroquois
would
rush
straight
ahead
and
would
not
discover
for
two
or
three
minutes
that
they
were
off
the
trail
it
would
take
them
another
two
or
three
minutes
to
recover
and
he
would
make
a
gain
of
at
least
five
minutes
five
minutes
had
saved
the
life
of
many
a
man
on
the
border
how
precious
those
five
minutes
were
he
would
take
them
all
he
ran
forward
some
distance
stopped
where
the
trees
grew
thick
and
then
enjoyed
the
golden
five
minute
by
minute
he
had
felt
that
he
was
pumping
the
very
lifeblood
from
his
heart
his
breath
had
come
painfully
and
the
thongs
of
the
snowshoes
were
chafing
his
ankles
terribly
but
those
minutes
were
worth
a
year
fresh
air
poured
into
his
lungs
and
the
muscles
became
elastic
once
more
in
so
brief
a
space
he
had
recreated
himself
resuming
his
flight
he
went
at
a
steady
pace
resolved
not
to
do
his
utmost
unless
the
enemy
came
in
sight
about
ten
minutes
later
he
heard
a
cry
far
behind
him
and
he
believed
it
to
be
a
signal
from
some
indian
to
the
others
that
the
trail
was
found
again
but
with
so
much
advantage
he
felt
sure
that
he
was
now
quite
safe
he
ran
although
at
decreased
speed
for
about
two
hours
more
and
then
he
sat
down
on
the
upthrust
root
of
a
great
oak
here
he
depended
most
upon
his
ears
the
forest
was
so
silent
that
he
could
hear
any
noise
at
a
great
distance
but
there
was
none
trusting
to
his
ears
to
warn
him
he
would
remain
there
a
long
time
for
a
thorough
rest
he
even
dared
to
take
off
his
snowshoes
that
he
might
rub
his
sore
ankles
but
he
wrapped
his
heavy
blanket
about
his
body
lest
he
take
deep
cold
in
cooling
off
in
such
a
temperature
after
so
long
a
flight
he
sat
enjoying
a
half
hour
golden
like
the
five
minutes
and
then
he
saw
outlined
against
the
bright
moonlit
sky
something
that
told
him
he
must
be
on
the
alert
again
it
was
a
single
ring
of
smoke
like
that
from
a
cigar
only
far
greater
it
rose
steadily
untroubled
by
wind
until
it
was
dissipated
it
meant
and
presently
it
was
followed
by
a
column
of
such
rings
one
following
another
beautifully
the
column
said
foe
is
henry
read
the
indian
signs
perfectly
the
rings
were
made
by
covering
a
little
fire
with
a
blanket
for
a
moment
and
then
allowing
the
smoke
to
ascend
on
clear
days
such
signals
could
be
seen
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
or
more
and
he
knew
that
they
were
full
of
significance
evidently
the
iroquois
party
had
divided
into
two
or
more
bands
one
had
found
his
trail
and
was
signaling
to
the
other
the
party
sending
up
the
smoke
might
be
a
half
mile
away
but
the
others
although
his
trail
was
yet
hidden
from
them
might
be
nearer
it
was
again
time
for
flight
he
swiftly
put
on
the
snowshoes
neglecting
no
thong
or
lace
folded
the
blanket
on
his
back
again
and
leaving
the
friendly
root
started
once
more
he
ran
forward
at
moderate
speed
for
perhaps
a
mile
when
he
suddenly
heard
triumphant
yells
on
both
right
and
left
a
strong
party
of
iroquois
were
coming
up
on
either
side
and
luck
had
enabled
them
to
catch
him
in
a
trap
they
were
so
near
that
they
fired
upon
him
and
one
bullet
nicked
his
glove
but
he
was
hopeful
that
after
his
long
rest
he
might
again
stave
them
off
he
sent
back
no
defiant
cry
but
settling
into
determined
silence
ran
at
his
utmost
speed
the
forest
here
was
of
large
trees
with
no
undergrowth
and
he
noticed
that
the
two
parties
did
not
join
but
kept
on
as
they
had
come
one
on
the
right
and
the
other
on
the
left
this
fact
must
have
some
significance
but
he
could
not
fathom
it
neither
could
he
guess
whether
the
indians
were
fresh
or
tired
but
apparently
they
made
no
effort
to
come
within
range
of
his
rifle
presently
he
made
a
fresh
spurt
of
speed
the
forest
opened
out
and
then
both
bands
uttered
a
yell
full
of
ferocity
and
joy
the
kind
that
savages
utter
only
when
they
see
their
triumph
complete
before
and
far
below
henry
stretched
a
vast
white
expanse
he
had
come
to
the
lake
but
at
a
point
where
the
cliff
rose
high
like
a
mountain
and
steep
like
a
wall
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
so
far
down
that
it
was
misty
white
like
a
cloud
now
he
understood
the
policy
of
the
indian
bands
in
not
uniting
they
knew
that
they
would
soon
reach
the
lofty
cliffs
of
the
lake
and
if
he
turned
to
either
right
or
left
there
was
a
band
ready
to
seize
him
henry
heart
leaped
up
and
then
sank
lower
than
ever
before
in
his
life
it
seemed
that
he
could
not
escape
from
so
complete
a
trap
and
braxton
wyatt
was
not
one
who
would
spare
a
prisoner
that
was
perhaps
the
bitterest
thing
of
all
to
be
taken
and
tortured
by
braxton
wyatt
he
was
there
he
could
hear
his
voice
in
one
of
the
bands
and
then
the
courage
that
never
failed
him
burst
into
fire
again
the
iroquois
were
coming
toward
him
shutting
him
out
from
retreat
to
either
right
or
left
but
not
yet
closing
in
because
of
his
deadly
rifle
he
gave
them
a
single
look
put
forth
his
voice
in
one
great
cry
of
defiance
and
rushing
toward
the
edge
of
the
mighty
cliff
sprang
boldly
over
as
henry
plunged
downward
he
heard
behind
him
a
shout
of
amazement
and
chagrin
poured
forth
from
many
iroquois
throats
and
taking
a
single
glance
backward
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
dusky
faces
stamped
with
awe
but
the
bold
youth
had
not
made
a
leap
to
destruction
in
the
passage
of
a
second
he
had
calculated
rapidly
and
well
while
the
cliff
at
first
glance
seemed
perpendicular
it
could
not
be
so
there
was
a
slope
coated
with
two
feet
of
snow
and
swinging
far
back
on
the
heels
of
his
snowshoes
he
shot
downward
like
one
taking
a
tremendous
slide
on
a
toboggan
faster
and
faster
he
went
but
deeper
and
deeper
he
dug
his
shoes
into
the
snow
until
he
lay
back
almost
flat
against
its
surface
this
checked
his
speed
somewhat
but
it
was
still
very
great
and
preserving
his
perfectly
he
prayed
aloud
to
kindly
providence
to
save
him
from
some
great
boulder
or
abrupt
drop
the
snow
from
his
runners
flew
in
a
continuous
shower
behind
him
as
he
descended
yet
he
drew
himself
compactly
together
and
held
his
rifle
parallel
with
his
body
once
or
twice
as
he
went
over
a
little
ridge
he
shot
clear
of
the
snow
but
he
held
his
body
rigid
and
the
snow
beyond
saved
him
from
a
severe
bruise
then
his
speed
was
increased
again
and
all
the
time
the
white
surface
of
the
lake
below
seen
dimly
through
the
night
and
his
flight
seemed
miles
away
he
might
never
reach
that
surface
alive
but
of
one
thing
lie
was
sure
none
of
the
iroquois
or
tories
had
dared
to
follow
braxton
wyatt
could
have
no
triumph
over
him
he
was
alone
in
his
great
flight
once
a
projection
caused
him
to
turn
a
little
to
one
side
he
was
in
momentary
danger
of
turning
entirely
and
then
of
rolling
head
over
heels
like
a
huge
snowball
but
with
a
mighty
effort
he
righted
himself
and
continued
the
descent
on
the
runners
with
the
heels
plowing
into
the
ice
and
the
snow
now
that
white
expanse
which
had
seemed
so
far
away
came
miles
nearer
presently
he
would
be
there
the
impossible
had
become
possible
the
unattainable
was
about
to
be
attained
he
gave
another
mighty
dig
with
his
shoes
the
last
reach
of
the
slope
passed
behind
him
and
he
shot
out
on
the
frozen
surface
of
the
lake
bruised
and
breathless
but
without
a
single
broken
bone
the
lake
was
covered
with
ice
a
foot
thick
and
over
this
lay
frozen
snow
which
stopped
henry
forty
or
fifty
yards
from
the
cliff
there
he
lost
his
balance
at
last
and
fell
on
his
side
where
he
lay
for
a
few
moments
weak
panting
but
triumphant
when
he
stood
upright
again
he
felt
his
body
but
he
had
suffered
nothing
save
some
bruises
that
would
heal
in
their
own
good
time
his
deerskin
clothing
was
much
torn
particularly
on
the
back
where
he
had
leaned
upon
the
ice
and
snow
but
the
folded
blanket
had
saved
him
to
a
considerable
extent
one
of
his
shoes
was
pulled
loose
and
presently
he
discovered
that
his
left
ankle
was
smarting
and
burning
at
a
great
rate
but
he
did
not
mind
these
things
at
all
so
complete
was
his
sense
of
victory
he
looked
up
at
the
mighty
white
wall
that
stretched
above
him
fifteen
hundred
feet
and
he
wondered
at
his
own
tremendous
exploit
the
wall
ran
away
for
miles
and
the
iroquois
could
not
reach
him
by
any
easier
path
he
tried
to
make
out
figures
on
the
brink
looking
down
at
him
but
it
was
too
far
away
and
he
saw
only
a
black
line
he
tightened
the
loose
shoe
and
struck
out
across
the
lake
he
was
far
away
from
alcove
and
he
did
not
intend
to
go
there
lest
the
iroquois
by
chance
come
upon
his
trail
and
follow
it
to
the
refuge
but
as
it
was
no
more
than
two
miles
across
the
lake
at
that
point
and
the
iroquois
would
have
to
make
a
great
curve
to
reach
the
other
side
he
felt
perfectly
safe
he
walked
slowly
across
conscious
all
the
time
of
an
increasing
pain
in
his
left
ankle
which
must
now
be
badly
swollen
and
he
did
not
stop
until
he
penetrated
some
distance
among
low
bills
here
under
an
overhanging
cliff
with
thick
bushes
in
front
he
found
a
partial
shelter
which
he
cleared
out
yet
further
then
with
infinite
patience
he
built
a
fire
with
splinters
that
he
cut
from
dead
boughs
hung
his
blanket
in
front
of
it
on
two
sticks
that
the
flame
might
not
be
seen
took
off
his
snowshoes
leggins
and
socks
and
bared
his
ankles
both
were
swollen
but
the
left
much
more
badly
than
the
other
he
doubted
whether
he
would
be
able
to
walk
on
the
following
day
but
he
rubbed
them
a
long
time
both
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
with
snow
until
they
felt
better
then
he
replaced
his
clothing
leaned
back
against
the
faithful
snowshoes
which
had
saved
his
life
however
much
they
had
hurt
his
ankles
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
warmth
of
the
fire
it
was
very
luxurious
this
warmth
and
this
rest
after
so
long
and
terrible
a
flight
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
great
relaxation
one
which
if
he
yielded
to
it
completely
would
make
his
muscles
so
stiff
and
painful
that
he
could
not
use
them
hence
he
stretched
his
arms
and
legs
many
times
rubbed
his
ankles
again
and
then
remembering
that
he
had
venison
ate
several
strips
he
knew
that
he
had
taken
a
little
risk
with
the
fire
but
a
fire
he
was
bound
to
have
and
he
fed
it
again
until
he
had
a
great
mass
of
glowing
coals
although
there
was
no
blaze
then
he
took
down
the
blanket
wrapped
himself
in
it
and
was
soon
asleep
before
the
fire
he
slept
long
and
deeply
and
although
when
he
awoke
the
day
had
fully
come
the
coals
were
not
yet
out
entirely
he
arose
but
such
a
violent
pain
from
his
left
ankle
shot
through
him
that
he
abruptly
sat
down
again
as
he
bad
feared
it
had
swollen
badly
during
the
night
and
he
could
not
walk
in
this
emergency
henry
displayed
no
petulance
no
striving
against
unchangeable
circumstance
he
drew
up
more
wood
which
he
had
stacked
against
the
cliff
and
put
it
on
the
coals
he
hung
up
the
blanket
once
more
in
order
that
it
might
hide
the
fire
stretched
out
his
lame
leg
and
calmly
made
a
breakfast
off
the
last
of
his
venison
he
knew
he
was
in
a
plight
that
might
appall
the
bravest
but
he
kept
himself
in
hand
it
was
likely
that
the
iroquois
thought
him
dead
crushed
into
a
shapeless
mass
by
his
frightful
slide
of
fifteen
hundred
feet
and
he
had
little
fear
of
them
but
to
be
unable
to
walk
and
alone
in
an
icy
wilderness
without
food
was
sufficient
in
itself
he
calculated
that
it
was
at
least
a
dozen
miles
to
alcove
and
the
chances
were
a
hundred
to
one
against
any
of
his
comrades
wandering
his
way
he
looked
once
more
at
his
swollen
left
ankle
and
he
made
a
close
calculation
it
would
be
three
days
more
likely
four
before
he
could
walk
upon
it
could
he
endure
hunger
that
long
he
could
he
would
crouched
in
his
nest
with
his
back
to
the
cliff
he
had
defense
against
any
enemy
in
his
rifle
and
pistol
by
faithful
watching
he
might
catch
sight
of
some
wandering
animal
a
target
for
his
rifle
and
then
food
for
his
stomach
his
wilderness
wisdom
warned
him
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
sit
quiet
and
wait
he
scarcely
moved
for
hours
as
long
as
he
was
still
his
ankle
troubled
him
but
little
the
sun
came
out
silver
bright
but
it
had
no
warmth
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
shown
only
by
the
smoothness
of
its
expanse
the
icy
covering
was
the
same
everywhere
over
hills
and
valleys
across
the
lake
he
saw
the
steep
down
which
he
had
slid
looming
white
and
lofty
in
the
distance
it
looked
perpendicular
and
whatever
its
terrors
it
had
beyond
a
doubt
saved
his
life
he
glanced
down
at
his
swollen
ankle
and
despite
his
helpless
situation
he
was
thankful
that
he
had
escaped
so
well
about
noon
he
moved
enough
to
throw
up
the
snowbanks
higher
all
around
himself
in
the
fashion
of
an
eskimos
house
then
he
let
the
fire
die
except
some
coals
that
gave
forth
no
smoke
stretched
the
blanket
over
his
head
in
the
manner
of
a
roof
and
once
more
resumed
his
quiet
and
stillness
he
was
now
like
a
crippled
animal
in
its
lair
but
he
was
warm
and
his
wound
did
not
hurt
him
but
hunger
began
to
trouble
him
he
was
young
and
so
powerful
that
his
frame
demanded
much
sustenance
now
it
cried
aloud
its
need
he
ate
two
or
three
handfuls
of
snow
and
for
a
few
moments
it
seemed
to
help
him
a
little
but
his
hunger
soon
came
back
as
strong
as
ever
then
he
tightened
his
belt
and
sat
in
grim
silence
trying
to
forget
that
there
was
any
such
thing
as
food
the
effort
of
the
will
was
almost
a
success
throughout
the
afternoon
but
before
night
it
failed
he
began
to
have
roseate
visions
of
long
jim
trying
venison
wild
duck
bear
and
buffalo
steaks
over
the
coals
he
could
sniff
the
aroma
so
powerful
had
his
imagination
become
and
in
fancy
his
month
watered
while
its
roof
was
really
dry
they
were
daylight
visions
and
he
knew
it
well
but
they
taunted
him
and
made
his
pain
fiercer
he
slid
forward
a
little
to
the
mouth
of
his
shelter
and
thrust
out
his
rifle
in
the
hope
that
he
would
see
some
wild
creature
no
matter
what
he
felt
that
he
could
shoot
it
at
any
distance
and
then
he
would
feast
he
saw
nothing
living
either
on
earth
or
in
the
air
only
motionless
white
and
beyond
showing
but
faintly
now
through
the
coming
twilight
the
lofty
cliff
that
had
saved
him
he
drew
back
into
his
lair
and
the
darkness
came
down
despite
his
hunger
he
slept
fairly
well
in
the
night
a
little
snow
fell
at
times
but
his
blanket
roof
protected
him
and
he
remained
dry
and
warm
the
new
snow
was
in
a
way
a
satisfaction
as
it
completely
hid
his
trail
from
the
glance
of
any
wandering
indian
he
awoke
the
next
morning
to
a
gray
somber
day
with
piercing
winds
from
the
northwest
he
did
not
feel
the
pangs
of
hunger
until
he
had
been
awake
about
a
half
hour
and
then
they
came
with
redoubled
force
moreover
he
had
become
weaker
in
the
night
and
added
to
the
loss
of
muscular
strength
was
a
decrease
in
the
power
of
the
will
hunger
was
eating
away
his
mental
as
well
as
his
physical
fiber
he
did
not
face
the
situation
with
quite
the
same
confidence
that
he
felt
the
day
before
the
wilderness
looked
a
little
more
threatening
his
lips
felt
as
if
he
were
suffering
from
fever
and
his
shoulders
and
back
were
stiff
but
he
drew
his
belt
tighter
again
and
then
uncovered
his
left
ankle
the
swelling
had
gone
down
a
little
and
he
could
move
it
with
more
freedom
than
on
the
day
before
but
he
could
not
yet
walk
once
more
he
made
his
grim
calculation
in
two
days
he
could
certainly
walk
and
hunt
game
or
make
a
try
for
alcove
so
far
as
his
ankle
was
concerned
but
would
hunger
overpower
him
before
that
time
gaining
strength
in
one
direction
he
was
losing
it
in
another
now
he
began
to
grow
angry
with
himself
the
light
inroad
that
famine
made
upon
his
will
was
telling
it
seemed
incredible
that
he
so
powerful
so
skillful
so
self
reliant
so
long
used
to
the
wilderness
and
to
every
manner
of
hardship
should
be
held
there
in
a
snowbank
by
a
bruised
ankle
to
die
like
a
crippled
rabbit
his
comrades
could
not
be
more
than
ten
miles
away
he
could
walk
he
would
walk
he
stood
upright
and
stepped
out
into
the
snow
but
pain
so
agonizing
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
from
crying
out
shot
through
his
whole
body
and
he
sank
back
into
the
shelter
sure
not
to
make
such
an
experiment
again
for
another
full
day
the
day
passed
much
like
its
predecessor
except
that
he
took
down
the
blanket
cover
of
his
snow
hut
and
kindled
up
his
fire
again
more
for
the
sake
of
cheerfulness
than
for
warmth
because
he
was
not
suffering
from
cold
there
was
a
certain
life
and
light
about
the
coals
and
the
bright
flame
but
the
relief
did
not
last
long
and
by
and
by
he
let
it
go
out
then
be
devoted
himself
to
watching
the
heavens
and
the
surface
of
the
snow
some
winter
bird
duck
or
goose
might
be
flying
by
or
a
wandering
deer
might
be
passing
he
must
not
lose
any
such
chance
he
was
more
than
ever
a
fierce
creature
of
prey
sitting
at
the
mouth
of
his
den
the
rifle
across
his
knee
his
tanned
face
so
thin
that
the
cheek
bones
showed
high
and
sharp
his
eyes
bright
with
fever
and
the
fierce
desire
for
prey
and
the
long
lean
body
drawn
forward
as
if
it
were
about
to
leap
he
thought
often
of
dragging
himself
down
to
the
lake
breaking
a
hole
in
the
ice
and
trying
to
fish
but
the
idea
invariably
came
only
to
be
abandoned
he
had
neither
hook
nor
bait
in
the
afternoon
he
chewed
the
edge
of
his
buckskin
hunting
shirt
but
it
was
too
thoroughly
tanned
and
dry
it
gave
back
no
sustenance
he
abandoned
the
experiment
and
lay
still
for
a
long
time
that
night
he
had
a
slight
touch
of
frenzy
and
began
to
laugh
at
himself
it
was
a
huge
joke
what
would
timmendiquas
or
thayendanegea
think
of
him
if
they
knew
how
he
came
to
his
end
they
would
put
him
with
old
squaws
or
little
children
and
how
braxton
wyatt
and
his
lieutenant
the
squat
tory
would
laugh
that
was
the
bitterest
thought
of
all
but
the
frenzy
passed
and
he
fell
into
a
sleep
which
was
only
a
succession
of
bad
dreams
he
was
running
the
gauntlet
again
among
the
shawnees
again
kneeling
to
drink
at
the
clear
pool
he
saw
in
the
water
the
shadow
of
the
triumphant
warrior
holding
the
tomahawk
above
him
one
after
another
the
most
critical
periods
of
his
life
were
lived
over
again
and
then
he
sank
into
a
deep
torpor
from
which
he
did
not
rouse
himself
until
far
into
the
next
day
henry
was
conscious
that
he
was
very
weak
but
he
seemed
to
have
regained
much
of
his
lost
will
he
looked
once
more
at
the
fatal
left
ankle
it
had
improved
greatly
he
could
even
stand
upon
it
but
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
felt
a
singular
dizziness
again
what
he
had
gained
in
one
way
he
had
lost
in
another
the
earth
wavered
the
smooth
surface
of
the
lake
seemed
to
rise
swiftly
and
then
to
sink
as
swiftly
the
far
slope
down
which
he
had
shot
rose
to
the
height
of
miles
there
was
a
pale
tinge
too
over
the
world
he
sank
down
not
because
of
his
ankle
but
because
he
was
afraid
his
dizzy
head
would
make
him
fall
the
power
of
will
slipped
away
again
for
a
minute
or
two
he
was
ashamed
of
such
extraordinary
weakness
he
looked
at
one
of
his
hands
it
was
thin
like
the
band
of
a
man
wasted
with
fever
and
the
blue
veins
stood
out
on
the
back
of
it
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
hand
was
his
own
but
after
the
first
spasm
of
weakness
was
over
the
precious
will
returned
he
could
walk
strength
enough
to
permit
him
to
hobble
along
had
returned
to
the
ankle
at
last
and
mind
must
control
the
rest
of
his
nervous
system
however
weakened
it
might
be
he
must
seek
food
he
withdrew
into
the
farthest
recess
of
his
covert
wrapped
the
blanket
tightly
about
his
body
and
lay
still
for
a
long
time
he
was
preparing
both
mind
and
body
for
the
supreme
effort
he
knew
that
everything
hung
now
on
the
surviving
remnants
of
his
skill
and
courage
weakened
by
shock
and
several
days
of
fasting
he
had
no
great
reserve
now
except
the
mental
and
he
used
that
to
the
utmost
it
was
proof
of
his
youthful
greatness
that
it
stood
the
last
test
as
he
lay
there
the
final
ounce
of
will
and
courage
came
strength
which
was
of
the
mind
rather
than
of
the
body
flowed
back
into
his
veins
he
felt
able
to
dare
and
to
do
the
pale
aspect
of
the
world
went
away
and
once
more
he
was
henry
ware
alert
skillful
and
always
triumphant
then
he
rose
again
folded
the
blanket
and
fastened
it
on
his
shoulders
he
looked
at
the
snowshoes
but
decided
that
his
left
ankle
despite
its
great
improvement
would
not
stand
the
strain
he
must
break
his
way
through
the
snow
which
was
a
full
three
feet
in
depth
fortunately
the
crust
had
softened
somewhat
in
the
last
two
or
three
days
and
he
did
not
have
a
covering
of
ice
to
meet
he
pushed
his
way
for
the
first
time
from
the
lair
under
the
cliff
his
rifle
held
in
his
ready
hands
in
order
that
he
might
miss
no
chance
at
game
to
an
ordinary
observer
there
would
have
been
no
such
chance
at
all
it
was
merely
a
grim
white
wilderness
that
might
have
been
without
anything
living
from
the
beginning
but
henry
the
forest
runner
knew
better
somewhere
in
the
snow
were
lairs
much
like
the
one
that
he
had
left
and
in
these
lairs
were
wild
animals
to
any
such
wild
animal
whether
panther
or
bear
the
hunter
would
now
have
been
a
fearsome
object
with
his
hollow
cheeks
his
sunken
fiery
eyes
and
his
thin
lips
opening
now
and
then
and
disclosing
the
two
rows
of
strong
white
teeth
henry
advanced
about
a
rod
and
then
he
stopped
breathing
hard
because
it
was
desperate
work
for
one
in
his
condition
to
break
his
way
through
snow
so
deep
but
his
ankle
stood
the
strain
well
and
his
courage
increased
rather
than
diminished
he
was
no
longer
a
cripple
confined
to
one
spot
while
he
stood
resting
he
noticed
a
clump
of
bushes
about
half
a
rod
to
his
left
and
a
hopeful
idea
came
to
him
he
broke
his
way
slowly
to
the
bushes
and
then
he
searched
carefully
among
them
the
snow
was
not
nearly
so
thick
there
and
under
the
thickest
clump
where
the
shelter
was
best
he
saw
a
small
round
opening
in
an
instant
all
his
old
vigorous
life
all
the
abounding
hope
which
was
such
a
strong
characteristic
of
his
nature
came
back
to
him
already
he
had
triumphed
over
indians
tories
the
mighty
slope
snow
ice
crippling
and
starvation
he
laid
the
rifle
on
the
snow
and
took
the
ramrod
in
his
right
hand
he
thrust
his
left
hand
into
the
hole
and
when
the
rabbit
leaped
for
life
from
his
warm
nest
a
smart
blow
of
the
ramrod
stretched
him
dead
at
the
feet
of
the
hunter
henry
picked
up
the
rabbit
it
was
large
and
yet
fat
here
was
food
for
two
meals
in
the
race
between
the
ankle
and
starvation
the
ankle
had
won
he
did
not
give
way
to
any
unseemly
elation
he
even
felt
a
momentary
sorrow
that
a
life
must
perish
to
save
his
own
because
all
these
wild
things
were
his
kindred
now
he
returned
by
the
path
that
he
had
broken
kindled
his
fire
anew
dexterously
skinned
and
cleaned
his
rabbit
then
cooked
it
and
ate
half
although
he
ate
slowly
and
with
intervals
between
each
piece
how
delicious
it
tasted
and
how
his
physical
being
longed
to
leap
upon
it
and
devour
it
but
the
power
of
the
mind
was
still
supreme
he
knew
what
was
good
for
himself
and
he
did
it
everything
was
done
in
order
and
with
sobriety
then
he
put
the
rest
of
the
rabbit
carefully
in
his
food
pouch
wrapped
the
blanket
about
his
body
leaned
back
and
stretched
his
feet
to
the
coals
what
an
extraordinary
change
had
come
over
the
world
in
an
hour
he
had
not
noticed
before
the
great
beauty
of
the
lake
the
lofty
cliffs
on
the
farther
shore
and
the
forest
clothed
in
white
and
hanging
with
icicles
the
winter
sunshine
was
molten
silver
pouring
down
in
a
flood
it
was
not
will
now
but
actuality
that
made
him
feel
the
strength
returning
to
his
frame
he
knew
that
the
blood
in
his
veins
had
begun
to
sparkle
and
that
his
vitality
was
rising
fast
he
could
have
gone
to
sleep
peacefully
but
instead
he
went
forth
and
hunted
again
he
knew
that
where
the
rabbit
had
been
others
were
likely
to
be
near
and
before
he
returned
he
had
secured
two
more
both
of
these
he
cleaned
and
cooked
at
once
when
this
was
done
night
had
come
but
he
ate
again
and
then
securing
all
his
treasures
about
him
fell
into
the
best
sleep
that
he
had
enjoyed
since
his
flight
he
felt
very
strong
the
next
morning
and
he
might
have
started
then
but
he
was
prudent
there
was
still
a
chance
of
meeting
the
iroquois
and
the
ankle
might
not
stand
so
severe
a
test
he
would
rest
in
his
nest
for
another
day
and
then
he
would
be
equal
to
anything
few
could
lie
a
whole
day
in
one
place
with
but
little
to
do
and
with
nothing
passing
before
the
eyes
but
it
was
a
part
of
henry
wilderness
training
and
he
showed
all
the
patience
of
the
forester
he
knew
too
as
the
hours
went
by
that
his
strength
was
rising
all
the
while
almost
the
last
soreness
would
be
gone
from
his
ankle
and
then
he
could
glide
swiftly
over
the
snow
back
to
his
comrades
he
was
content
he
had
in
fact
a
sense
of
great
triumph
because
he
had
overcome
so
much
and
here
was
new
food
in
this
example
for
future
efforts
of
the
mind
for
future
victories
of
the
will
over
the
body
the
wintry
sun
came
to
the
zenith
then
passed
slowly
down
the
curve
but
all
the
time
the
boy
scarcely
stirred
once
there
was
a
flight
of
small
birds
across
the
heavens
and
he
watched
them
vaguely
but
apparently
he
took
no
interest
toward
night
he
stood
up
in
his
recess
and
flexed
and
tuned
his
muscles
for
a
long
time
driving
out
any
stiffness
that
might
come
through
long
lack
of
motion
then
he
ate
and
lay
down
but
he
did
not
yet
sleep
the
night
was
clear
and
he
looked
away
toward
the
point
where
he
knew
lay
a
good
moon
was
now
shining
and
stars
by
the
score
were
springing
out
suddenly
at
a
point
on
that
far
shore
a
spark
of
red
light
appeared
and
twinkled
most
persons
would
have
taken
it
for
some
low
star
but
henry
knew
better
it
was
fire
put
there
by
human
hand
for
a
purpose
doubtless
a
signal
and
as
he
looked
a
second
spark
appeared
by
the
first
then
a
third
then
a
fourth
he
uttered
a
great
sigh
of
pleasure
it
was
his
four
friends
signaling
to
him
somewhere
in
the
vast
unknown
that
they
were
alive
and
well
and
beckoning
him
to
come
the
lights
burned
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
and
then
all
went
out
together
henry
turned
over
on
his
side
and
fell
sound
asleep
in
the
morning
he
put
on
his
snowshoes
and
started
chapter
xix
the
safe
return
the
surface
of
the
snow
had
frozen
again
in
the
night
and
henry
found
good
footing
for
his
shoes
for
a
while
he
leaned
most
on
the
right
ankle
but
as
his
left
developed
no
signs
of
soreness
he
used
them
equally
and
sped
forward
his
spirits
rising
at
every
step
the
air
was
cold
and
there
was
but
little
breeze
but
his
own
motion
made
a
wind
that
whipped
his
face
the
hollows
were
mostly
gone
from
his
cheeks
and
his
eyes
no
longer
had
the
fierce
questing
look
of
the
famishing
wild
animal
in
search
of
prey
a
fine
red
color
was
suffused
through
the
brown
of
his
face
he
had
chosen
his
course
with
due
precaution
the
broad
surface
smooth
white
and
glittering
tempted
but
he
put
the
temptation
away
he
did
not
wish
to
run
any
chance
whatever
of
another
iroquois
pursuit
and
he
kept
in
the
forest
that
ran
down
close
to
the
water
edge
it
was
tougher
traveling
there
but
he
persisted
but
all
thought
of
weariness
and
trouble
was
lost
in
his
glorious
freedom
with
his
crippled
ankle
he
had
been
really
like
a
prisoner
in
his
cell
with
a
ball
and
chain
to
his
foot
now
he
flew
along
while
the
cold
wind
whipped
his
blood
and
felt
what
a
delight
it
was
merely
to
live
he
went
on
thus
for
hours
skirting
down
toward
the
cliffs
that
contained
he
rested
a
while
in
the
afternoon
and
ate
the
last
of
his
rabbit
but
before
twilight
he
reached
the
creek
and
stood
at
the
hidden
path
that
led
up
to
their
home
henry
sat
down
behind
thick
bushes
and
took
off
his
snowshoes
to
one
who
had
never
come
before
the
whole
place
would
have
seemed
absolutely
desolate
and
even
to
one
not
a
stranger
no
sign
of
life
would
have
been
visible
had
he
not
possessed
uncommonly
keen
eyes
but
henry
had
such
eyes
he
saw
the
faintest
wisp
of
smoke
stealing
away
against
the
surface
of
the
cliff
and
he
felt
confident
that
all
four
were
there
he
resolved
to
surprise
them
laying
the
shoes
aside
he
crept
so
carefully
up
the
path
that
he
dislodged
no
snow
and
made
no
noise
of
any
kind
as
he
gradually
approached
he
beard
the
murmur
of
voices
and
presently
as
he
turned
an
angle
in
the
path
he
saw
a
beam
of
glorious
mellow
light
falling
on
the
snow
but
the
murmur
of
the
voices
sent
a
great
thrill
of
delight
through
him
low
and
indistinct
as
they
were
they
had
a
familiar
sound
he
knew
all
those
tones
they
were
the
voices
of
his
faithful
comrades
the
four
who
had
gone
with
him
through
so
many
perils
and
hardships
the
little
band
who
with
himself
were
ready
to
die
at
any
time
one
for
another
he
crept
a
little
closer
and
then
a
little
closer
still
lying
almost
flat
on
the
steep
path
and
drawing
himself
forward
he
looked
into
a
fire
of
deep
red
coals
glowed
in
one
corner
and
disposed
about
it
were
the
four
paul
lay
on
his
elbow
on
a
deerskin
and
was
gazing
into
the
coals
tom
ross
was
working
on
a
pair
of
moccasins
long
jim
was
making
some
kind
of
kitchen
implement
and
sol

talking
henry
could
hear
the
words
distinctly
and
they
were
about
himself

paul
moved
a
little
on
his
elbow
and
turned
the
other
side
of
his
face
to
the
fire
then
he
glanced
at
the
silent
worker
with
the
moccasins
and
jim
do
seem
to
agree
much
in
their
second
sight
he
said

to
see
all
the
others
sprang
to
their
feet
in
astonishment
and
henry
likewise
sprang
to
his
feet
three
leaps
and
he
was
in
the
mellow
glow
so
you
saw
me
tom
he
exclaimed
as
he
joyously
grasped
one
hand
after
another

have
known
that
while
i
could

i
could

silent
tom

the
foolish
talk
that
they
most
always

an
when
paul
called
on
me
i
thought
i
would
give
a
dream
that
true
worth
right
said
henry
not
been
having
any
easy
time
and
for
a
while
boys
it
looked
as
if
i
never
would
come
back
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
they
gave
him
the
warmest
place
by
the
fire
brought
him
the
tenderest
food
and
he
told
the
long
and
thrilling
tale
do
believe
anybody
else
but
you
would
have
tried
it
henry
said
paul
when
they
heard
of
the
fearful
slide
one
of
you
would
have
done
it
said
henry
modestly
glad
that
you
done
it
for
two
reasons
said
sol
it
helped
you
to
git
away
an
the
other
that
scoundrel
braxton
wyatt
did
take
you
hurt
my
pride
for
any
uv
us
to
be
took
by
braxton
speak
for
us
all
there
sol
said
paul
have
all
of
you
been
doing
asked
henry
much
of
anything
replied
sol
been
several
times
lookin
fur
you
though
we
knowed
you
come
in
some
time
or
other
but
mostly
we
been
workin
the
place
here
fixin
it
up
warmer
an
storin
away
have
to
continue
at
that
for
some
time
i
afraid
said
henry
this
snow
breaks
up
have
any
of
you
heard
if
any
movement
is
yet
on
foot
against
the
iroquois
ran
across
some
scouts
from
the
militia
replied
paul
they
said
nothing
could
be
done
until
warm
weather
came
then
a
real
army
would
hope
so
said
henry
earnestly
but
for
the
present
the
five
could
achieve
little
the
snow
lasted
a
long
time
but
it
was
finally
swept
away
by
big
rains
it
poured
for
two
days
and
nights
and
even
when
the
rain
ceased
the
snow
continued
to
melt
under
the
warmer
air
the
water
rushed
in
great
torrents
down
the
cliffs
and
would
have
entered
had
not
the
five
made
provision
to
turn
it
away
as
it
was
they
sat
snug
and
dry
listening
to
the
gush
of
the
water
the
sign
of
falling
snow
and
the
talk
of
one
another
yet
the
time
dragged
wuz
never
made
to
be
a
caged
animile
said
sol
longer
i
stay
shet
up
in
one
place
the
weaker
i
become
my
temper
improve
neither
an
i
ai
it
the
same
with
all
uv
us
said
tom
ross
but
when
the
earth
came
from
beneath
the
snow
although
it
was
still
cold
weather
they
began
again
to
range
the
forest
far
in
every
direction
and
they
found
that
the
indians
and
the
tories
also
were
becoming
active
there
were
more
burnings
more
slaughters
and
more
scalpings
the
whole
border
was
still
appalled
at
the
massacres
of
wyoming
and
cherry
valley
and
the
savages
were
continually
spreading
over
a
wider
area
braxton
wyatt
at
the
head
of
his
band
and
with
the
aid
of
his
tory
lieutenant
levi
coleman
had
made
for
himself
a
name
equal
to
that
of
walter
butler
as
for
butler
and
his
men
no
men
were
hated
more
thoroughly
than
they
the
five
continued
to
do
the
best
they
could
which
was
much
carrying
many
a
warning
and
saving
some
who
would
otherwise
have
been
victims
while
they
devoted
themselves
to
their
strenuous
task
great
events
in
which
they
were
to
take
a
part
were
preparing
the
rear
guard
of
the
revolution
was
about
to
become
for
the
time
the
main
guard
a
great
eye
had
been
turned
upon
the
ravaged
and
bleeding
border
and
a
great
mind
which
could
bear
complaint
was
preparing
to
send
help
to
those
farther
away
so
mighty
a
cry
of
distress
had
risen
that
the
power
of
the
iroquois
must
be
destroyed
as
the
warm
weather
came
the
soldiers
began
to
march
rumors
that
a
formidable
foe
was
about
to
advance
reached
the
iroquois
and
their
allies
the
tories
the
english
and
the
canadians
there
was
a
great
stirring
among
the
leaders
thayendanegea
hiokatoo
sangerachte
the
johnsons
the
butlers
claus
and
the
rest
haldimand
the
king
representative
in
canada
sent
forth
an
urgent
call
to
all
the
iroquois
to
meet
the
enemy
the
tories
were
extremely
active
promises
were
made
to
the
tribes
that
they
should
have
other
victories
even
greater
than
those
of
wyoming
and
cherry
valley
and
again
the
terrible
queen
esther
went
among
them
swinging
her
great
war
tomahawk
over
her
head
and
chanting
her
song
of
death
she
more
than
any
other
inflamed
the
iroquois
and
they
were
eager
for
the
coming
contest
timmendiquas
had
gone
back
to
the
ohio
country
in
the
winter
but
faithful
to
his
promise
to
give
thayendanegea
help
to
the
last
he
returned
in
the
spring
with
a
hundred
chosen
warriors
of
the
wyandot
nation
a
reenforcement
the
value
of
which
could
not
be
estimated
too
highly
henry
and
his
comrades
felt
the
stir
as
they
roamed
through
the
forest
and
they
thrilled
at
the
thought
that
the
crisis
was
approaching
then
they
set
out
for
lake
otsego
where
the
army
was
gathering
for
the
great
campaign
they
were
equipped
thoroughly
and
they
were
now
so
well
known
in
the
region
that
they
knew
they
would
be
welcome
they
traveled
several
days
and
were
preparing
to
encamp
for
the
last
night
within
about
fifteen
miles
of
the
lake
when
henry
scouting
as
usual
to
see
if
an
enemy
were
near
heard
a
footstep
in
the
forest
he
wheeled
instantly
to
cover
behind
the
body
of
a
great
beech
tree
and
the
stranger
sought
to
do
likewise
only
he
had
no
convenient
tree
that
was
so
large
it
was
about
the
twelfth
hour
but
henry
could
see
a
portion
of
a
body
protruding
beyond
a
slim
oak
and
he
believed
that
he
recognized
it
as
he
held
the
advantage
he
would
at
any
rate
hail
the
stranger
cornelius
heemskerk
dutchman
fat
man
great
scout
and
woodsman
what
are
you
doing
in
my
wilderness
stand
forth
at
once
and
give
an
account
of
yourself
or
i
will
shoot
off
the
part
of
your
body
that
sticks
beyond
that
oak
tree
the
answer
was
instantaneous
a
round
plump
body
revolved
from
the
partial
shelter
of
the
tree
and
stood
upright
in
the
open
rifle
in
hand
and
cap
thrown
back
from
a
broad
ruddy
brow
mynheer
henry
ware
replied
cornelius
heemskerk
in
a
loud
clear
tone
am
in
your
woods
on
perhaps
the
same
errand
that
you
are
come
from
behind
that
beech
and
let
us
see
which
has
the
stronger
henry
stood
forth
and
the
two
clasped
hands
in
a
grip
so
powerful
that
both
winced
then
they
released
hands
simultaneously
and
heemskerk
asked
the
other
four
mynheers
am
i
wrong
to
say
that
they
are
near
somewhere
are
not
wrong
replied
henry
are
alive
well
and
hungry
not
a
mile
from
here
there
is
one
man
whom
they
would
be
very
glad
to
see
and
his
name
is
cornelius
heemskerk
who
is
roaming
in
our
woods
without
a
the
round
ruddy
face
of
the
dutchman
glowed
it
was
obvious
that
he
felt
as
much
delight
in
seeing
henry
as
henry
felt
in
seeing
him
heart
swells
he
said
feared
that
you
might
have
been
killed
or
scalped
or
at
the
best
have
gone
back
to
that
far
land
of
have
wintered
well
said
henry
a
place
of
which
i
shall
not
tell
you
now
and
we
are
here
to
see
the
campaign
come
too
for
the
same
purpose
said
heemskerk
shall
be
together
it
is
said
henry
camp
fire
is
lighted
jim
hart
whom
you
have
known
of
old
is
cooking
strips
of
meat
over
the
coals
and
although
it
is
a
mile
away
the
odor
of
them
is
very
pleasant
in
my
nostrils
i
wish
to
go
back
there
and
it
will
be
all
the
more
delightful
to
me
and
to
those
who
wait
if
i
can
bring
with
me
such
a
welcome
on
mynheer
said
cornelius
heemskerk
sententiously
he
received
an
equally
emphatic
welcome
from
the
others
and
then
they
ate
and
talked
heemskerk
was
sanguine
will
be
done
this
time
he
said
has
come
from
the
great
commander
that
the
iroquois
must
be
crushed
the
thousands
who
have
fallen
must
be
avenged
and
this
great
fire
along
our
border
must
be
stopped
if
it
can
not
be
done
then
we
perish
we
have
old
tales
in
my
own
country
of
the
cruel
deeds
that
the
spaniards
did
long
long
ago
but
they
were
not
worse
than
have
been
done
the
five
made
no
response
but
the
mind
of
every
one
of
them
traveled
back
to
wyoming
and
all
that
they
had
seen
there
and
the
scars
and
traces
of
many
more
tragedies
they
reached
the
camp
on
lake
otsego
the
next
day
and
henry
saw
that
all
they
had
heard
was
true
the
most
formidable
force
that
they
had
ever
seen
was
gathering
there
were
many
companies
in
the
continental
buff
and
blue
epauletted
officers
bayonets
and
cannon
the
camp
was
full
of
life
energy
and
hope
and
the
five
at
once
felt
the
influence
of
it
they
found
here
old
friends
whom
they
had
known
in
the
march
on
oghwaga
william
gray
young
taylor
and
others
and
they
were
made
very
welcome
they
were
presented
to
general
james
clinton
then
in
charge
received
roving
commissions
as
scouts
and
hunters
and
with
heemskerk
and
the
two
celebrated
borderers
timothy
murphy
and
david
elerson
they
roamed
the
forest
in
a
great
circle
about
the
lake
bringing
much
valuable
information
about
the
movements
of
the
enemy
who
in
their
turn
were
gathering
in
force
while
the
royal
authorities
were
dispatching
both
indians
and
white
men
from
canada
to
help
them
these
great
scouting
expeditions
saved
the
five
from
much
impatience
it
takes
a
long
time
for
an
army
to
gather
and
then
to
equip
itself
for
the
march
and
they
were
so
used
to
swift
motion
that
it
was
now
a
part
of
their
nature
at
last
the
army
was
ready
and
it
left
the
lake
then
it
proceeded
in
boats
down
the
tioga
flooded
to
a
sufficient
depth
by
an
artificial
dam
built
with
immense
labor
to
its
confluence
with
the
larger
river
here
were
more
men
and
the
five
saw
a
new
commander
general
james
sullivan
take
charge
of
the
united
force
then
the
army
late
in
august
began
its
march
upon
the
iroquois
the
five
were
now
in
the
van
miles
ahead
of
the
main
guard
they
knew
that
no
important
movement
of
so
large
a
force
could
escape
the
notice
of
the
enemy
but
they
with
other
scouts
made
it
their
duty
to
see
that
the
americans
marched
into
no
trap
it
was
now
the
waning
summer
the
leaves
were
lightly
touched
with
brown
and
the
grass
had
begun
to
wither
berries
were
ripening
on
the
vines
and
the
quantity
of
game
had
increased
the
wild
animals
returning
to
the
land
from
which
civilized
man
had
disappeared
the
desolation
seemed
even
more
complete
than
in
the
autumn
before
in
the
winter
and
spring
the
iroquois
and
tories
had
destroyed
the
few
remnants
of
houses
that
were
left
braxton
wyatt
and
his
band
had
been
particularly
active
in
this
work
and
many
tales
had
come
of
his
cruelty
and
that
of
his
swart
tory
lieutenant
coleman
henry
was
sure
too
that
wyatt
band
which
numbered
perhaps
fifty
indians
and
tories
was
now
in
front
of
them
he
his
comrades
heemskerk
elerson
murphy
and
four
others
twelve
brave
forest
runners
all
told
went
into
camp
one
night
about
ten
miles
ahead
of
the
army
they
lighted
no
fire
and
even
had
it
been
cold
they
would
not
have
done
so
as
the
region
was
far
too
dangerous
for
any
light
yet
the
little
band
felt
no
fear
they
were
only
twelve
it
is
true
but
such
a
twelve
no
chance
would
either
indians
or
tories
have
to
surprise
them
they
merely
lay
down
in
the
thick
brushwood
three
intending
to
keep
watch
while
the
others
slept
henry
sol
and
heemskerk
were
the
sentinels
it
was
very
late
nearly
midnight
the
sky
was
clear
and
presently
they
saw
smoke
rings
ascending
from
high
hills
to
their
right
to
be
answered
soon
by
other
rings
of
smoke
to
their
left
the
three
watched
them
with
but
little
comment
and
read
every
signal
in
turn
they
said
enemy
is
still
advancing
is
too
strong
for
us
we
must
retreat
and
await
our
means
that
there
will
be
no
battle
at
least
whispered
heemskerk
is
probably
ahead
of
us
in
command
and
he
will
avoid
us
until
he
receives
the
fresh
forces
from
take
it
that
you
right
henry
whispered
back
also
is
with
him
and
the
two
great
chiefs
are
too
cunning
to
fight
until
they
can
bring
their
last
man
into
then
said
the
shiftless
one
see
what
said
henry
very
gravely
see
what
happens
the
iroquois
are
a
powerful
confederacy
they
ruled
in
these
woods
for
hundreds
of
years
they
led
by
great
chiefs
and
they
helped
by
our
white
enemies
you
ca
tell
what
would
happen
even
to
an
army
like
ours
in
an
sol
nodded
and
they
said
no
more
until
an
hour
later
when
they
heard
footsteps
they
awakened
the
others
and
the
twelve
crawling
to
the
edge
of
the
brushwood
lay
almost
flat
upon
their
faces
with
their
hands
upon
the
triggers
of
their
rifles
braxton
wyatt
and
his
band
of
nearly
threescore
indians
and
tories
in
about
equal
numbers
were
passing
wyatt
walked
at
the
head
despite
his
youth
he
had
acquired
an
air
of
command
and
he
seemed
a
fit
leader
for
such
a
crew
he
wore
a
faded
royal
uniform
and
while
a
small
sword
hung
at
his
side
he
also
carried
a
rifle
on
his
shoulder
close
behind
him
was
the
swart
and
squat
tory
coleman
and
then
came
indians
and
tories
together
the
watchful
eyes
of
henry
saw
three
fresh
scalps
hanging
from
as
many
belts
and
the
finger
that
lay
upon
the
trigger
of
his
rifle
fairly
ached
to
press
it
what
an
opportunity
this
would
be
if
the
twelve
were
only
forty
or
even
thirty
with
the
advantage
of
surprise
they
might
hope
to
annihilate
this
band
which
had
won
such
hate
for
itself
on
the
border
but
twelve
were
not
enough
and
twelve
such
lives
could
not
be
spared
at
a
time
when
the
army
needed
them
most
henry
pressed
his
teeth
firmly
together
in
order
to
keep
down
his
disappointment
by
a
mere
physical
act
if
possible
he
happened
to
look
at
sol
and
saw
that
his
teeth
were
pressed
together
in
the
same
manner
it
is
probable
that
like
feelings
swayed
every
one
of
the
twelve
but
they
were
so
still
in
the
brushwood
that
no
iroquois
heard
grass
or
leaf
rustle
thus
the
twelve
watched
the
sixty
pass
and
after
they
were
gone
henry
sol
and
tim
murphy
followed
for
several
miles
they
saw
wyatt
proceed
toward
the
chemung
river
and
as
they
approached
the
stream
they
beheld
signs
of
fortifications
it
was
now
nearly
daylight
and
as
indians
were
everywhere
they
turned
back
but
they
were
convinced
that
the
enemy
meant
to
fight
on
the
chemung
chapter
xx
a
gloomy
council
the
next
night
after
henry
ware
and
his
comrades
lay
in
the
brushwood
and
saw
braxton
wyatt
and
his
band
pass
a
number
of
men
famous
or
infamous
in
their
day
were
gathered
around
a
low
camp
fire
on
the
crest
of
a
small
hill
the
most
distinguished
of
them
all
in
looks
was
a
young
indian
chief
of
great
height
and
magnificent
build
with
a
noble
and
impressive
countenance
he
wore
nothing
of
civilized
attire
the
nearest
approach
to
it
being
the
rich
blanket
that
was
flung
gracefully
over
his
right
shoulder
it
was
none
other
than
the
great
wyandot
chief
timmendiquas
saying
little
and
listening
without
expression
to
the
words
of
the
others
near
timmendiquas
sat
thayendanegea
dressed
as
usual
in
his
mixture
of
savage
and
civilized
costume
and
about
him
were
other
famous
indian
chiefs
the
corn
planter
red
jacket
hiokatoo
sangerachte
little
beard
a
young
seneca
renowned
for
ferocity
and
others
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
sat
the
white
men
the
young
sir
john
johnson
who
a
prisoner
to
the
colonials
had
broken
his
oath
of
neutrality
the
condition
of
his
release
and
then
fleeing
to
canada
had
returned
to
wage
bloody
war
on
the
settlements
his
colonel
guy
johnson
the
swart
and
squat
john
butler
of
wyoming
infamy
his
son
walter
butler
of
the
pallid
face
thin
lips
and
cruel
heart
the
canadian
captain
macdonald
braxton
wyatt
his
lieutenant
the
dark
tory
coleman
and
some
others
who
had
helped
to
ravage
their
former
land
sir
john
johnson
a
tall
man
with
blue
eyes
set
close
together
wore
the
handsome
uniform
of
his
royal
greens
he
had
committed
many
dark
deeds
or
permitted
them
to
be
done
by
men
under
his
command
and
he
had
secured
the
opportunity
only
through
his
broken
oath
but
he
had
lost
greatly
the
vast
estates
of
his
father
sir
william
johnson
were
being
torn
from
him
and
perhaps
he
saw
even
then
that
in
return
for
what
he
had
done
he
would
lose
all
and
become
an
exile
from
the
country
in
which
he
was
born
it
was
not
a
cheerful
council
there
was
no
exultation
as
after
wyoming
and
cherry
valley
and
the
minisink
and
other
places
sir
john
bit
his
lip
uneasily
and
his
resting
his
hand
on
his
knee
stared
gloomily
at
the
fire
the
two
butlers
were
silent
and
the
dark
face
of
thayendanegea
was
overcast
a
little
distance
before
these
men
was
a
breastwork
about
half
a
mile
long
connecting
with
a
bend
of
the
river
in
such
a
manner
that
an
enemy
could
attack
only
in
front
and
on
one
flank
that
flank
itself
being
approached
only
by
the
ascent
of
a
steep
ridge
which
ran
parallel
to
the
river
the
ground
about
the
camp
was
covered
with
pine
and
scrub
oaks
many
others
had
been
cut
down
and
added
to
the
breastwork
a
deep
brook
ran
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
which
the
leaders
sat
about
the
slopes
of
this
hill
and
another
a
little
distance
away
sat
hundreds
of
indian
warriors
all
in
their
war
paint
and
other
hundreds
of
their
white
allies
conspicuous
among
them
johnson
royal
greens
and
rangers
these
men
made
but
little
noise
now
they
were
resting
and
waiting
thayendanegea
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
in
the
group
at
the
fire
he
turned
his
dark
face
to
sir
john
johnson
and
said
in
his
excellent
english
king
promised
us
that
if
we
would
take
up
arms
for
him
against
the
yankees
he
would
send
a
great
army
many
thousands
to
help
us
we
believed
him
and
we
took
up
the
hatchet
for
him
we
fought
in
the
dark
and
the
storm
with
herkimer
at
the
oriskany
and
many
of
our
warriors
fell
but
we
did
not
sulk
in
our
lodges
we
have
ravaged
and
driven
in
the
whole
american
border
along
a
line
of
hundreds
of
miles
now
the
congress
sends
an
army
to
attack
us
to
avenge
what
we
have
done
and
the
great
forces
of
the
king
are
not
here
i
have
been
across
the
sea
i
have
seen
the
mighty
city
of
london
and
its
people
as
numerous
as
the
blades
of
grass
why
has
not
the
king
kept
his
promise
and
sent
men
enough
to
save
the
iroquois
sir
john
johnson
and
thayendanegea
were
good
friends
but
the
soul
of
the
great
mohawk
chief
was
deeply
stirred
his
penetrating
mind
saw
the
uplifted
hand
about
to
the
target
was
his
own
people
his
tone
became
bitterly
sarcastic
as
he
spoke
and
when
he
ceased
he
looked
directly
at
the
baronet
in
a
manner
that
showed
a
reply
must
be
given
sir
john
moved
uneasily
but
he
spoke
at
last
that
you
say
is
true
thayendanegea
he
admitted
the
king
has
many
things
to
do
the
war
is
spread
over
a
vast
area
and
he
must
keep
his
largest
armies
in
the
east
but
the
royal
greens
the
rangers
and
all
others
whom
we
can
raise
even
in
canada
are
here
to
help
you
in
the
coming
battle
your
fortunes
are
our
thayendanegea
nodded
but
he
was
not
yet
appeased
his
glance
fell
upon
the
two
butlers
father
and
son
and
he
frowned
are
many
in
england
itself
he
said
wish
us
harm
and
who
perhaps
have
kept
us
from
receiving
some
of
the
help
that
we
ought
to
have
they
speak
of
wyoming
and
cherry
valley
of
the
torture
and
of
the
slaughter
of
women
and
children
and
they
say
that
war
must
not
be
carried
on
in
such
a
way
but
there
are
some
among
us
who
are
more
savage
than
the
savages
themselves
as
they
call
us
it
was
you
john
butler
who
led
at
wyoming
and
it
was
you
walter
butler
who
allowed
the
women
and
children
to
be
killed
at
cherry
valley
and
more
would
have
been
slain
there
had
i
not
come
up
in
the
dark
face
of
butler
grew
darker
and
the
pallid
face
of
his
son
grew
more
pallid
both
were
angry
and
at
the
same
time
a
little
afraid
won
at
wyoming
in
fair
battle
said
the
elder
butler
afterwards
said
thayendanegea
the
man
was
silent
is
these
two
places
that
have
so
aroused
the
bostonians
against
us
continued
thayendanegea
is
because
of
them
that
the
commander
of
the
bostonians
has
sent
a
great
army
and
the
long
house
is
threatened
with
son
and
i
have
fought
for
our
common
cause
said
butler
the
blood
flushing
through
his
swarthy
face
sir
john
johnson
interfered
have
admitted
joseph
the
danger
to
the
iroquois
he
said
calling
the
chieftain
familiarly
by
his
first
christian
name
i
and
my
and
colonel
butler
and
captain
butler
have
already
lost
though
we
may
regain
and
with
this
strong
position
and
the
aid
of
ambush
it
is
likely
that
we
can
defeat
the
the
eyes
of
thayendanegea
brightened
as
he
looked
at
the
long
embankment
the
trees
and
the
dark
forms
of
the
warriors
scattered
numerously
here
and
there
may
be
right
sir
john
he
said
i
think
you
are
right
and
by
all
the
gods
red
and
white
we
shall
see
i
wish
to
fight
here
because
this
is
the
best
place
in
which
to
meet
the
bostonians
what
say
you
timmendiquas
sworn
brother
of
mine
great
warrior
and
great
chief
of
the
wyandots
the
bravest
of
all
the
western
nations
the
eye
of
timmendiquas
expressed
little
but
his
voice
was
sonorous
and
his
words
were
such
as
thayendanegea
wished
to
hear
we
fight
and
we
must
fight
this
is
the
place
in
which
to
meet
the
white
army
he
said
wyandots
are
here
to
help
the
iroquois
as
the
iroquois
would
go
to
help
them
the
manitou
of
the
wyandots
the
aieroski
of
the
iroquois
alone
knows
the
he
spoke
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
after
his
brief
reply
he
said
no
more
all
regarded
him
with
respect
and
admiration
even
braxton
wyatt
felt
that
it
was
a
noble
deed
to
remain
and
face
destruction
for
the
sake
of
tribes
not
his
own
sir
john
johnson
turned
to
braxton
wyatt
who
had
sat
all
the
while
in
silence
have
examined
the
evening
advance
wyatt
he
said
further
information
can
you
give
us
shall
certainly
be
attacked
replied
wyatt
the
american
army
is
advancing
cautiously
it
has
out
strong
flanking
parties
and
it
is
preceded
by
the
scouts
those
kentuckians
whom
i
know
and
have
met
often
murphy
elerson
heemskerk
and
the
we
could
only
lead
them
into
an
ambush
said
sir
john
kind
of
troops
even
the
best
of
regulars
will
give
way
before
an
unseen
foe
pouring
a
deadly
fire
upon
them
from
the
deep
woods
then
they
magnify
the
enemy
is
so
said
the
fierce
old
seneca
chief
hiokatoo
we
killed
braddock
and
all
his
men
they
thought
that
ten
warriors
stood
in
the
moccasins
of
only
sir
john
frowned
he
did
not
like
this
allusion
to
the
time
when
the
iroquois
fought
against
the
english
and
inflicted
on
them
a
great
defeat
but
he
feared
to
rebuke
the
old
chief
hiokatoo
and
the
senecas
were
too
important
ought
to
be
a
chance
yet
for
an
ambuscade
he
said
foliage
is
still
thick
and
heavy
and
sullivan
their
general
is
not
used
to
forest
warfare
what
say
you
to
this
wyatt
wyatt
shook
his
head
he
knew
the
caliber
of
the
five
from
kentucky
and
he
had
little
hope
of
such
good
fortune
have
learned
from
many
lessons
he
replied
their
scouts
are
the
best
moreover
they
will
attempt
they
relapsed
into
silence
again
and
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
renegade
roved
about
the
dark
circle
of
trees
and
warriors
that
inclosed
them
presently
he
saw
something
that
caused
him
to
rise
and
walk
a
little
distance
from
the
fire
although
his
eye
suspected
and
his
mind
confirmed
braxton
wyatt
could
not
believe
that
it
was
true
it
was
incredible
no
one
be
he
ever
so
daring
would
dare
such
a
thing
but
the
figure
down
there
among
the
trees
passing
about
among
the
warriors
many
of
whom
did
not
know
one
another
certainly
looked
familiar
despite
the
indian
paint
and
garb
only
that
of
timmendiquas
could
rival
it
in
height
and
nobility
these
were
facts
that
could
not
be
hidden
by
any
disguise
is
it
wyatt
asked
sir
john
do
you
see
why
do
you
look
so
startled
wyatt
sought
to
reply
calmly
is
a
warrior
among
those
trees
over
there
whom
i
have
not
seen
here
before
he
replied
is
as
tall
and
as
powerful
as
timmendiquas
and
there
is
only
one
such
there
is
a
spy
among
us
and
it
is
henry
he
snatched
a
pistol
from
his
belt
ran
forward
and
fired
at
the
flitting
figure
which
was
gone
in
an
instant
among
the
trees
and
the
warriors
do
you
say
exclaimed
thayendanegea
as
he
ran
forward
spy
and
you
know
him
to
be
such
he
is
the
worst
of
them
all
replied
wyatt
know
him
i
could
not
mistake
him
but
he
has
dared
too
much
he
can
not
get
the
great
camp
was
now
in
an
uproar
the
tall
figure
was
seen
here
and
there
always
to
vanish
quickly
twenty
shots
were
fired
at
it
none
hit
many
more
would
have
been
fired
but
the
camp
was
too
much
crowded
to
take
such
a
risk
every
moment
the
tumult
and
confusion
increased
but
thayendanegea
quickly
posted
warriors
on
the
embankment
and
the
flanks
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
fugitive
in
any
of
those
directions
but
the
tall
figure
did
not
appear
at
either
embankment
or
flank
it
was
next
seen
near
the
river
when
a
young
warrior
striving
to
strike
with
a
tomahawk
was
dashed
to
the
earth
with
great
force
the
next
instant
the
figure
leaped
far
out
into
the
stream
the
moonlight
glimmered
an
instant
on
the
bare
head
while
bullets
the
next
moment
pattered
on
the
water
where
it
had
been
then
with
a
few
powerful
strokes
the
stranger
reclaimed
the
land
sprang
upon
the
shore
and
darted
into
the
woods
with
more
vain
bullets
flying
about
him
but
he
sent
back
a
shout
of
irony
and
triumph
that
made
the
chiefs
and
tories
standing
on
the
bank
bite
their
lips
in
anger
chapter
xxi
battle
of
the
chemung
paul
had
been
sleeping
heavily
and
the
sharp
pealing
notes
of
a
trumpet
awoke
him
at
the
sunburst
of
a
brilliant
morning
henry
was
standing
beside
him
showing
no
fatigue
from
the
night
excitement
danger
and
escape
but
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
sparkled
paul
up
he
cried
know
the
enemy
position
and
we
will
be
in
battle
before
another
sun
paul
was
awake
in
an
instant
and
the
second
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
rifle
in
hand
and
heart
thrilling
for
the
great
attack
he
like
all
the
others
had
slept
on
such
a
night
fully
dressed
sol
long
jim
silent
tom
heemskerk
and
the
rest
were
by
the
side
of
him
and
all
about
them
rose
the
sounds
of
an
army
going
into
battle
commands
sharp
and
short
the
rolling
of
cannon
wheels
the
metallic
rattle
of
bayonets
the
clink
of
bullets
poured
into
the
pouches
and
the
hum
of
men
talking
in
sentences
it
was
to
all
the
five
a
vast
and
stirring
scene
it
was
the
first
time
that
they
had
ever
beheld
a
large
and
regular
army
going
into
action
and
they
were
a
part
of
it
a
part
by
no
means
unimportant
it
was
henry
with
his
consummate
skill
and
daring
who
had
uncovered
the
position
of
the
enemy
and
now
without
snatching
a
moment
sleep
he
was
ready
to
lead
where
the
fray
might
be
thickest
the
brief
breakfast
finished
the
trumpet
pealed
forth
again
and
the
army
began
to
move
through
the
thick
forest
a
light
wind
crisp
with
the
air
of
early
autumn
blew
and
the
leaves
rustled
the
sun
swinging
upward
in
the
east
poured
down
a
flood
of
brilliant
rays
that
lighted
up
everything
the
buff
and
blue
uniforms
the
cannon
the
rifles
the
bayonets
and
the
forest
still
heavy
with
foliage
now
thought
every
one
of
the
five
begin
the
vengeance
for
wyoming
the
scouts
were
well
in
front
searching
everywhere
among
the
thickets
for
the
indian
sharpshooters
who
could
scorch
so
terribly
as
braxton
wyatt
had
truly
said
these
scouts
were
the
best
in
the
world
nothing
could
escape
the
trained
eyes
of
henry
ware
and
his
comrades
and
those
of
murphy
ellerson
and
the
others
while
off
on
either
flank
of
the
army
heavy
detachments
guarded
against
any
surprise
or
turning
movement
they
saw
no
indian
sign
in
the
woods
there
was
yet
a
deep
silence
in
front
of
them
and
the
sun
rising
higher
poured
its
golden
light
down
upon
the
army
in
such
an
intense
vivid
flood
that
rifle
barrels
and
bayonets
gave
back
a
metallic
gleam
all
around
them
the
deep
woods
swayed
and
rustled
before
the
light
breeze
and
now
and
then
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
river
its
surface
now
gold
then
silver
under
the
shining
sun
henry
heart
swelled
as
he
advanced
he
was
not
revengeful
but
he
had
seen
so
much
of
savage
atrocity
in
the
last
year
that
he
could
not
keep
down
the
desire
to
see
punishment
it
is
only
those
in
sheltered
homes
who
can
forgive
the
tomahawk
and
the
stake
now
he
was
the
very
first
of
the
scouts
although
his
comrades
and
a
dozen
others
were
close
behind
him
the
scouts
went
so
far
forward
that
the
army
was
hidden
from
them
by
the
forest
although
they
could
yet
hear
the
clank
of
arms
and
the
sound
of
commands
henry
knew
the
ground
thoroughly
he
knew
where
the
embankment
ran
and
he
knew
too
that
the
iroquois
had
dug
pits
marked
by
timber
they
were
not
far
ahead
and
the
scouts
now
proceeded
very
slowly
examining
every
tree
and
clump
of
bushes
to
see
whether
a
lurking
enemy
was
hidden
there
the
silence
endured
longer
than
he
had
thought
nothing
could
be
seen
in
front
save
the
waving
forest
henry
stopped
suddenly
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
brown
shoulder
edge
showing
from
behind
a
tree
and
at
his
signal
all
the
scouts
sank
to
the
ground
the
savage
fired
but
the
bullet
the
first
of
the
battle
whistled
over
their
heads
the
sharp
crack
sounding
triply
loud
at
such
a
time
came
back
from
the
forest
in
many
echoes
and
a
light
puff
of
smoke
arose
quick
as
a
flash
before
the
brown
shoulder
and
body
exposed
to
take
aim
could
be
withdrawn
tom
ross
fired
and
the
mohawk
fell
uttering
his
death
yell
the
iroquois
in
the
woods
took
up
the
cry
pouring
forth
a
war
whoop
fierce
long
drawn
the
most
terrible
of
human
sounds
and
before
it
died
their
brethren
behind
the
embankment
repeated
it
in
tremendous
volume
from
hundreds
of
throats
it
was
a
shout
that
had
often
appalled
the
bravest
but
the
little
band
of
scouts
were
not
afraid
when
its
last
echo
died
they
sent
forth
a
fierce
defiant
note
of
their
own
and
crawling
forward
began
to
send
in
their
bullets
the
woods
in
front
of
them
swarmed
with
the
indian
skirmishers
who
replied
to
the
scouts
and
the
fire
ran
along
a
long
line
through
the
undergrowth
flashes
of
flames
appeared
puffs
of
smoke
arose
and
uniting
hung
over
the
trees
bullets
hissed
twigs
and
bark
fell
and
now
and
then
a
man
as
they
fought
from
tree
to
tree
henry
caught
one
glimpse
of
a
face
that
was
white
that
of
braxton
wyatt
and
he
sought
a
shot
at
the
renegade
leader
but
he
could
not
get
it
but
the
scouts
pushed
on
and
the
indian
and
tory
skirmishers
dropped
back
then
on
the
flanks
they
began
to
hear
the
rattle
of
rifle
fire
the
wings
of
the
army
were
in
action
but
the
main
body
still
advanced
without
firing
a
shot
the
scouts
could
now
see
through
the
trees
the
embankments
and
rifle
pits
and
they
could
also
see
the
last
of
the
iroquois
and
tory
skirmishers
leaping
over
the
earthworks
and
taking
refuge
with
their
army
then
they
turned
back
and
saw
the
long
line
of
their
own
army
steadily
advancing
while
the
sounds
of
heavy
firing
still
continued
on
both
flanks
henry
looked
proudly
at
the
unbroken
array
the
front
of
steel
and
the
cannon
he
felt
prouder
still
when
the
general
turned
to
him
and
said
have
done
well
ware
you
have
shown
us
exactly
where
the
enemy
lies
and
that
will
save
us
many
men
now
bigger
voices
than
those
of
the
rifles
shall
the
army
stopped
the
indian
position
could
be
plainly
seen
the
crest
of
the
earthwork
was
lined
with
fierce
dark
faces
and
here
and
there
among
the
brown
iroquois
were
the
green
uniforms
of
the
royalists
henry
saw
both
thayendanegea
and
timmendiquas
the
plumes
in
their
hair
waving
aloft
and
he
felt
sure
that
wherever
they
stood
the
battle
would
be
thickest
the
americans
were
now
pushing
forward
their
cannon
six
and
two
howitzers
the
howitzers
firing
shells
new
and
terrifying
missiles
to
the
indians
the
guns
were
wheeled
into
position
and
the
first
howitzer
was
fired
it
sent
its
great
shell
in
a
curving
line
at
and
over
the
embankment
where
it
burst
with
a
crash
followed
by
a
shout
of
mingled
pain
and
awe
then
the
second
howitzer
aimed
well
like
the
first
sent
a
shell
almost
to
the
same
point
and
a
like
cry
came
back
sol
watching
the
shots
jumped
up
and
down
in
delight
the
medicine
he
cried
wonder
how
you
like
that
you
butlers
an
johnsons
an
wyatts
an
mohawks
an
all
the
rest
o
your
crew
ah
thar
goes
another
this
ai
any
wyomin
the
also
opened
fire
and
sent
their
balls
squarely
into
the
rifle
pits
and
the
indian
camp
the
iroquois
replied
with
a
shower
of
rifle
bullets
and
a
defiant
war
whoop
but
the
bullets
fell
short
and
the
whoop
hurt
no
one
the
artillery
eight
pieces
was
served
with
rapidity
and
precision
while
the
riflemen
except
on
their
flanks
where
they
were
more
closely
engaged
were
ordered
to
hold
their
fire
the
spectacle
was
to
henry
and
his
comrades
panoramic
in
its
effect
they
watched
the
flashes
of
fire
from
the
mouths
of
the
cannon
the
flight
of
the
great
shells
and
the
bank
of
smoke
which
soon
began
to
lower
like
a
cloud
over
the
field
they
could
picture
to
themselves
what
was
going
on
beyond
the
earthwork
the
dead
falling
the
wounded
limping
away
earth
and
trees
torn
by
shell
and
shot
they
even
fancied
that
they
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
great
chiefs
thayendanegea
and
timmendiquas
encouraging
their
men
and
striving
to
keep
them
in
line
against
a
fire
not
as
deadly
as
rifle
bullets
at
close
quarters
but
more
terrifying
presently
a
cloud
of
skirmishers
issued
once
more
from
the
indian
camp
creeping
among
the
trees
and
bushes
and
seeking
a
chance
to
shoot
down
the
men
at
the
guns
but
sharp
eyes
were
watching
them
boys
exclaimed
henry
work
for
us
he
led
the
scouts
and
the
best
of
the
riflemen
against
the
skirmishers
who
were
soon
driven
in
again
the
artillery
fire
had
never
ceased
for
a
moment
the
shells
and
balls
passing
over
their
heads
their
work
done
the
sharpshooters
fell
back
again
the
gunners
worked
faster
for
a
while
and
then
at
a
command
they
ceased
suddenly
henry
paul
and
all
the
others
knew
instinctively
what
was
going
to
happen
they
felt
it
in
every
bone
of
them
the
silence
so
sudden
was
full
of
meaning
henry
found
himself
exclaiming
even
at
that
moment
the
order
was
given
and
the
whole
army
rushed
forward
the
smoke
floating
away
for
the
moment
and
the
sun
flashing
off
the
bayonets
the
five
sprang
up
and
rushed
on
ahead
a
sheet
of
flame
burst
from
the
embankment
and
the
rifle
pits
sprang
into
fire
the
five
beard
the
bullets
whizzing
past
them
and
the
sudden
cries
of
the
wounded
behind
them
but
they
never
ceased
to
rush
straight
for
the
embankment
it
seemed
to
henry
that
he
ran
forward
through
living
fire
there
was
one
continuous
flash
from
the
earthwork
and
a
continuous
flash
replied
the
rifles
were
at
work
now
thousands
of
them
and
they
kept
up
an
incessant
crash
while
above
them
rose
the
unbroken
thunder
of
the
cannon
the
volume
of
smoke
deepened
and
it
was
shot
through
with
the
sharp
pungent
odor
of
burned
gunpowder
henry
fired
his
rifle
and
pistol
almost
unconsciously
reloaded
and
fired
again
as
he
ran
and
then
noticed
that
the
advance
had
never
ceased
it
had
not
been
checked
even
for
a
moment
and
the
bayonets
of
one
of
the
regiments
glittered
in
the
sun
a
straight
line
of
steel
henry
kept
his
gaze
fixed
upon
a
point
where
the
earthwork
was
lowest
he
saw
there
the
plumed
head
of
thayendanegea
and
he
intended
to
strike
if
he
could
he
saw
the
mohawk
gesticulating
and
shouting
to
his
men
to
stand
fast
and
drive
back
the
charge
he
believed
even
then
and
he
knew
later
that
thayendanegea
and
timmendiquas
were
showing
courage
superior
to
that
of
the
johnsons
and
butters
or
any
of
their
british
and
canadian
allies
the
two
great
chiefs
still
held
their
men
in
line
and
the
iroquois
did
not
cease
to
send
a
stream
of
bullets
from
the
earthwork
henry
saw
the
brown
faces
and
the
embankment
coming
closer
and
closer
he
saw
the
face
of
braxton
wyatt
appear
a
moment
and
he
snapped
his
empty
pistol
at
it
but
it
was
hidden
the
next
instant
behind
others
and
then
they
were
at
the
embankment
he
saw
the
glowing
faces
of
his
comrades
at
his
side
the
singular
figure
of
heemskerk
revolving
swiftly
and
behind
them
the
line
of
bayonets
closing
in
with
the
grimness
of
fate
henry
leaped
upon
the
earthwork
an
indian
fired
at
him
point
blank
and
he
swung
heavily
with
his
clubbed
rifle
then
his
comrades
were
by
his
side
and
they
leaped
down
into
the
indian
camp
after
them
came
the
riflemen
and
then
the
line
of
bayonets
even
then
the
great
mohawk
and
the
great
wyandot
shouted
to
their
men
to
stand
fast
although
the
royal
greens
and
the
rangers
had
begun
to
run
and
the
johnsons
the
butlers
mcdonald
wyatt
and
the
other
white
men
were
running
with
them
henry
with
the
memory
of
wyoming
and
all
the
other
dreadful
things
that
had
come
before
his
eyes
saw
red
he
was
conscious
of
a
terrible
melee
of
striking
again
and
again
with
his
clubbed
rifle
of
fierce
brown
faces
before
him
and
of
timmendiquas
and
thayedanegea
rushing
here
and
there
shouting
to
their
warriors
encouraging
them
and
exclaiming
that
the
battle
was
not
lost
beyond
he
saw
the
vanishing
forms
of
the
royal
greens
and
the
rangers
in
full
flight
but
the
wyandots
and
the
best
of
the
iroquois
still
stood
fast
until
the
pressure
upon
them
became
overwhelming
when
the
line
of
bayonets
approached
their
breasts
they
fell
back
skilled
in
every
detail
of
ambush
and
a
wonderful
forest
fighter
the
indian
could
never
stand
the
bayonet
reluctantly
timmendiquas
thayendanegea
and
the
mohawks
senecas
and
wyandots
who
were
most
strenuous
in
the
conflict
gave
ground
yet
the
battlefield
with
its
numerous
trees
stumps
and
inequalities
still
favored
them
they
retreated
slowly
firing
from
every
covert
sending
a
shower
of
bullets
and
now
and
then
tittering
the
war
whoop
henry
heard
a
panting
breath
by
his
side
he
looked
around
and
saw
the
face
of
heemskerk
glowing
red
with
zeal
and
exertion
victory
is
won
already
said
he
to
drive
it
home
on
cried
henry
in
return
we
lead
a
single
glance
showed
him
that
none
of
his
comrades
had
fallen
long
jim
and
tom
ross
had
suffered
slight
wounds
that
they
scarcely
noticed
and
they
and
the
whole
group
of
scouts
were
just
behind
henry
but
they
now
took
breath
reloaded
their
rifles
and
throwing
themselves
down
in
indian
fashion
opened
a
deadly
fire
upon
their
antagonists
their
bullets
searched
all
the
thickets
drove
out
the
iroquois
and
compelled
them
to
retreat
anew
the
attack
was
now
pressed
with
fresh
vigor
in
truth
with
so
much
that
the
bravest
of
the
indians
at
last
yielded
to
panic
thayendanegea
and
timmendiquas
were
carried
away
in
the
rush
and
the
white
leaders
of
their
allies
were
already
out
of
sight
on
all
sides
the
allied
red
and
white
force
was
dissolving
precipitate
flight
was
saving
the
fugitives
from
a
greater
loss
in
killed
and
was
usually
indian
tactics
to
flee
with
great
speed
when
the
battle
began
to
go
against
the
people
of
the
long
house
had
suffered
the
greatest
overthrow
in
their
history
and
bitterness
and
despair
were
in
the
hearts
of
the
iroquois
chiefs
as
they
fled
the
american
army
not
only
carried
the
center
of
the
indian
camp
but
the
heavy
flanking
parties
closed
in
also
and
the
whole
indian
army
was
driven
in
at
every
point
the
retreat
was
becoming
a
rout
a
great
confused
conflict
was
going
on
the
rapid
crackle
of
rifles
mingled
with
the
shouts
and
war
whoops
of
the
combatants
smoke
floated
everywhere
the
victorious
army
animated
by
the
memory
of
the
countless
cruelties
that
had
been
practiced
on
the
border
pushed
harder
and
harder
the
iroquois
were
driven
back
along
the
chemung
it
seemed
that
they
might
be
hemmed
in
against
the
river
but
in
their
flight
they
came
to
a
ford
uttering
their
cry
of
despair
oonali
a
wail
for
a
battle
lost
they
sprang
into
the
stream
many
of
them
throwing
away
their
rifles
tomahawks
and
blankets
and
rushed
for
the
other
shore
but
the
scouts
and
a
body
of
riflemen
were
after
them
braxton
wyatt
and
his
band
appeared
in
the
woods
on
the
far
shore
and
opened
fire
on
the
pursuers
now
in
the
stream
he
alone
among
the
white
men
had
the
courage
or
the
desperation
to
throw
himself
and
his
men
in
the
path
of
the
pursuit
the
riflemen
in
the
water
felt
the
bullets
pattering
around
them
and
some
were
struck
but
they
did
not
stop
they
kept
on
for
the
bank
and
their
own
men
behind
them
opened
a
covering
fire
over
their
heads
henry
felt
a
great
pulse
leap
in
his
throat
at
the
sight
of
braxton
wyatt
again
nothing
could
have
turned
him
back
now
shouting
to
the
riflemen
he
led
the
charge
through
the
water
and
the
bank
defenders
were
driven
back
yet
wyatt
with
his
usual
dexterity
and
prudence
escaped
among
the
thickets
the
battle
now
became
only
a
series
of
detached
combats
little
groups
seeking
to
make
a
stand
here
and
there
were
soon
swept
away
thayendanegea
and
timmendiquas
raged
and
sought
to
gather
together
enough
men
for
an
ambush
for
anything
that
would
sting
the
victors
but
they
were
pushed
too
hard
and
fast
a
rally
was
always
destroyed
in
the
beginning
and
the
chiefs
themselves
at
last
ran
for
their
lives
the
pursuit
was
continued
for
a
long
time
not
only
by
the
vanguard
but
the
army
itself
moved
forward
over
the
battlefield
and
deep
into
the
forest
on
the
trail
of
the
flying
iroquois
the
scouts
continued
the
pursuit
the
longest
keeping
a
close
watch
nevertheless
against
an
ambush
now
and
then
they
exchanged
shots
with
a
band
but
the
indians
always
fled
quickly
and
at
last
they
stopped
because
they
could
no
longer
find
any
resistance
they
had
been
in
action
or
pursuit
for
many
hours
and
they
were
black
with
smoke
dust
and
sweat
but
they
were
not
yet
conscious
of
any
weariness
heemskerk
drew
a
great
red
silk
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
wiped
his
glowing
face
which
was
as
red
as
the
handkerchief
the
best
job
that
been
done
in
these
parts
for
many
a
year
he
said
iroquois
have
always
thought
they
were
invincible
and
now
the
spell
been
broke
if
we
only
follow
it
sure
to
be
done
said
henry
heard
general
sullivan
himself
say
that
his
orders
were
to
root
up
the
whole
iroquois
they
returned
slowly
toward
the
main
force
retracing
their
steps
over
the
path
of
battle
it
was
easy
enough
to
follow
it
they
beheld
a
dead
warrior
at
every
step
and
at
intervals
were
rifles
tomahawks
scalping
knives
blankets
and
an
occasional
shot
pouch
or
powder
horn
presently
they
reached
the
main
army
which
was
going
into
camp
for
the
night
many
camp
fires
were
built
and
the
soldiers
happy
in
their
victory
were
getting
ready
for
supper
but
there
was
no
disorder
they
had
been
told
already
that
they
were
to
march
again
in
the
morning
henry
paul
tom
jim
and
sol
went
back
over
the
field
of
battle
where
many
of
the
dead
still
lay
twilight
was
now
coming
and
it
was
a
somber
sight
the
earthwork
the
thickets
and
the
trees
were
torn
by
cannon
balls
some
tents
raised
by
the
tories
lay
in
ruins
and
the
earth
was
stained
with
many
dark
splotches
but
the
army
had
passed
on
and
it
was
silent
and
desolate
where
so
many
men
had
fought
the
twilight
drew
swiftly
on
to
night
and
out
of
the
forest
came
grewsome
sounds
the
wolves
thick
now
in
a
region
which
the
iroquois
had
done
so
much
to
turn
into
a
wilderness
were
learning
welcome
news
and
they
were
telling
it
to
one
another
by
and
by
as
the
night
deepened
the
five
saw
fiery
eyes
in
the
thickets
and
the
long
howls
came
again
sounds
like
the
dirge
of
the
people
of
the
long
house
said
paul
upon
whose
sensitive
mind
the
scene
made
a
deep
impression
the
others
nodded
at
that
moment
they
did
not
feel
the
flush
of
victory
in
its
full
force
it
was
not
in
their
nature
to
rejoice
over
a
fallen
foe
yet
they
knew
the
full
value
of
the
victory
and
none
of
them
could
wish
any
part
of
it
undone
they
returned
slowly
to
the
camp
and
once
more
they
heard
behind
them
the
howl
of
the
wolves
as
they
invaded
the
battlefield
they
were
glad
when
they
saw
the
cheerful
lights
of
the
camp
fires
twinkling
through
the
forest
and
heard
the
voices
of
many
men
talking
heemskerk
welcomed
them
there
lads
he
said
must
wo
find
out
until
you
begin
how
hungry
you
then
you
must
sleep
because
we
march
early
and
we
march
the
dutchman
words
were
true
they
had
not
tasted
food
since
morning
they
had
never
thought
of
it
but
now
with
the
relaxation
from
battle
they
found
themselves
voraciously
hungry
mighty
good
said
sol
as
they
sat
by
a
fire
and
ate
bread
and
meat
and
drank
coffee
i
say
this
for
you
you
old
ornery
jim
hart
it
ai
any
better
than
the
venison
bulffaler
steaks
that
you
cooked
fur
us
many
a
that
i
likely
to
cook
fur
you
many
a
time
more
said
long
jim
complacently
it
will
be
months
before
you
have
any
chance
at
buffalo
again
jim
said
henry
are
going
on
a
long
campaign
through
the
iroquois
it
shore
to
be
a
dangerous
one
said
sol
like
warriors
o
the
iroquois
ai
goin
to
give
up
with
one
fight
be
hangin
on
our
flanks
like
true
said
henry
in
my
opinion
the
iroquois
are
overthrown
forever
one
defeat
means
more
to
them
than
a
half
dozen
to
they
said
little
more
but
by
and
by
lay
down
to
sleep
before
the
fires
they
had
toiled
so
long
and
so
faithfully
that
the
work
of
watching
and
scouting
that
night
could
be
intrusted
to
others
yet
henry
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
the
noises
of
the
night
interested
him
he
watched
the
men
going
about
and
the
sentinels
pacing
back
and
forth
around
the
camp
the
sounds
died
gradually
as
the
men
lay
down
and
sank
to
sleep
the
fires
which
had
formed
a
great
core
of
light
also
sank
and
the
shadows
crept
toward
the
camp
the
figures
of
the
pacing
sentinels
rifle
on
shoulder
gradually
grew
dusky
henry
nerves
attuned
so
long
to
great
effort
slowly
relaxed
deep
peace
came
over
him
and
his
eyelids
drooped
the
sounds
in
the
camp
sank
to
the
lowest
murmur
but
just
as
he
was
falling
asleep
there
came
from
the
battlefield
behind
then
the
far
faint
howl
of
a
wolf
the
dirge
of
the
iroquois
chapter
xxii
little
beard
town
the
trumpets
called
early
the
next
morning
and
the
five
rose
refreshed
ready
for
new
labors
the
fires
were
already
lighted
and
breakfast
was
cooking
savory
odors
permeated
the
forest
but
as
soon
as
all
had
eaten
the
army
marched
going
northward
and
westward
intending
to
cut
through
the
very
center
of
the
iroquois
country
orders
had
come
from
the
great
commander
that
the
power
of
the
six
nations
which
had
been
so
long
such
a
terrible
scourge
on
the
american
frontier
must
be
annihilated
they
must
be
made
strangers
in
their
own
country
women
and
children
were
not
to
be
molested
but
their
towns
must
perish
as
thayendanegea
had
said
the
night
before
the
battle
of
the
chemung
the
power
beyond
the
seas
that
had
urged
the
iroquois
to
war
on
the
border
did
not
save
them
it
could
not
british
and
tories
alike
had
promised
them
certain
victory
and
for
a
while
it
had
seemed
that
the
promises
would
come
true
but
the
tide
had
turned
and
the
iroquois
were
fugitives
in
their
own
country
the
army
continued
its
march
through
the
wilderness
the
scouts
in
front
and
heavy
parties
of
riflemen
on
either
flank
there
was
no
chance
for
a
surprise
henry
and
his
comrades
were
aware
that
indian
bands
still
lurked
in
the
forest
and
they
had
several
narrow
escapes
from
the
bullets
of
ambushed
foes
but
the
progress
of
the
army
was
irresistible
nothing
could
check
it
for
a
moment
however
much
the
indian
and
tory
chiefs
might
plan
they
camped
again
that
night
in
the
forest
with
a
thorough
ring
of
sentinels
posted
against
surprise
although
there
was
little
danger
of
the
latter
as
the
enemy
could
not
for
the
present
at
least
bring
a
sufficient
force
into
the
field
but
after
the
moon
had
risen
the
five
with
heemskerk
went
ahead
through
the
forest
the
iroquois
town
of
kanawaholla
lay
just
ahead
and
the
army
would
reach
it
on
the
morrow
it
was
the
intention
of
the
scouts
to
see
if
it
was
still
occupied
it
was
near
midnight
when
the
little
party
drew
near
to
kanawaholla
and
watched
it
from
the
shelter
of
the
forest
like
most
other
iroquois
towns
it
contained
wooden
houses
and
cultivated
fields
were
about
it
no
smoke
rose
from
any
of
the
chimneys
but
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
scouts
saw
loaded
figures
departing
through
a
great
field
of
ripe
and
waving
corn
it
was
the
last
of
the
inhabitants
fleeing
with
what
they
could
carry
two
or
three
warriors
might
have
been
in
that
group
of
fugitives
but
the
scouts
made
no
attempt
to
pursue
they
could
not
restrain
a
little
feeling
of
sympathy
and
pity
although
a
just
retribution
was
coming
the
iroquois
had
only
stood
neutral
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
as
we
asked
them
said
heemskerk
much
might
have
been
spared
to
both
sides
look
those
people
are
stopping
for
a
the
burdened
figures
perhaps
a
dozen
halted
at
the
far
edge
of
the
corn
field
henry
and
paul
readily
imagined
that
they
were
taking
a
last
look
at
their
town
and
the
feeling
of
pity
and
sympathy
deepened
despite
wyoming
cherry
valley
and
all
the
rest
but
that
feeling
never
extended
to
the
white
allies
of
the
iroquois
whom
thayendanegea
characterized
in
word
and
in
writing
as
savage
than
the
savages
the
scouts
waited
an
hour
and
then
entered
the
town
not
a
soul
was
in
kanawaholla
some
of
the
lighter
things
had
been
taken
away
but
that
was
all
most
of
the
houses
were
in
disorder
showing
the
signs
of
hasty
flight
but
the
town
lay
wholly
at
the
mercy
of
the
advancing
army
henry
and
his
comrades
withdrew
with
the
news
and
the
next
day
when
the
troops
advanced
kanawaholla
was
put
to
the
torch
in
an
hour
it
was
smoking
ruins
and
then
the
crops
and
fruit
trees
were
destroyed
leaving
ruin
behind
the
army
continued
its
march
treading
the
iroquois
power
under
foot
and
laying
waste
the
country
one
after
another
the
indian
towns
were
destroyed
catherinetown
kendaia
kanadesaga
shenanwaga
skoiyase
kanandaigua
honeyoye
kanaghsawa
gathtsewarohare
and
others
forming
a
long
roll
bearing
the
sounding
iroquois
names
villages
around
cayuga
and
other
lakes
were
burned
by
detachments
the
smoke
of
perishing
towns
arose
everywhere
in
the
iroquois
country
while
the
iroquois
themselves
fled
before
the
advancing
army
they
sent
appeal
after
appeal
for
help
from
those
to
whom
they
had
given
so
much
help
but
none
came
it
was
now
deep
autumn
and
the
nights
grew
cold
the
forests
blazed
with
brilliant
colors
the
winds
blew
leaves
rustled
and
fell
the
winter
would
soon
be
at
hand
and
the
iroquois
so
proud
of
what
they
had
achieved
would
have
to
find
what
shelter
they
could
in
the
forests
or
at
the
british
posts
on
the
canadian
frontier
thayendanegea
was
destined
to
come
again
with
bands
of
red
men
and
white
and
inflict
great
loss
but
the
power
of
the
six
nations
was
overthrown
forever
after
four
centuries
of
victory
and
glory
henry
paul
and
the
rest
were
all
the
time
in
the
thick
of
it
the
army
as
the
autumn
advanced
marched
into
the
genesee
valley
destroying
everything
henry
and
paul
as
they
lay
on
their
blankets
one
night
counted
fires
in
three
different
directions
and
every
one
of
the
three
marked
a
perishing
indian
village
it
was
not
a
work
in
which
they
took
any
delight
on
the
contrary
it
often
saddened
them
but
they
felt
that
it
had
to
be
done
and
they
could
not
shirk
the
task
in
october
henry
despite
his
youth
took
command
of
a
body
of
scouts
and
riflemen
which
beat
up
the
ways
and
skirmished
in
advance
of
the
army
it
was
a
democratic
little
band
everyone
saying
what
he
pleased
but
yielding
in
the
end
to
the
authority
of
the
leader
they
were
now
far
up
the
genesee
toward
the
great
lakes
and
henry
formed
the
plan
of
advancing
ahead
of
the
army
on
the
great
seneca
village
known
variously
as
the
seneca
castle
and
little
beard
town
after
its
chief
a
full
match
in
cruelty
for
the
older
seneca
chief
hiokatoo
several
causes
led
to
this
decision
it
was
reported
that
thayendanegea
timmendiquas
all
the
butlers
and
johnsons
and
braxton
wyatt
were
there
while
not
likely
to
be
true
about
all
it
was
probably
true
about
some
of
them
and
a
bold
stroke
might
effect
much
it
is
probable
that
henry
had
braxton
wyatt
most
in
mind
the
renegade
was
in
his
element
among
the
indians
and
tories
and
he
had
developed
great
abilities
as
a
partisan
being
skillfully
seconded
by
the
squat
tory
coleman
his
reputation
now
was
equal
at
least
to
that
of
walter
butler
and
he
had
skirmished
more
than
once
with
the
vanguard
of
the
army
growing
in
henry
heart
was
a
strong
desire
to
match
forces
with
him
and
it
was
quite
probable
that
a
swift
advance
might
find
him
at
the
seneca
castle
the
riflemen
took
up
their
march
on
a
brisk
morning
in
late
autumn
the
night
had
been
clear
and
cold
with
a
touch
of
winter
in
it
and
the
brilliant
colors
of
the
foliage
had
now
turned
to
a
solid
brown
whenever
the
wind
blew
the
leaves
fell
in
showers
the
sky
was
a
fleecy
blue
but
over
hills
valley
and
forest
hung
a
fine
misty
veil
that
is
the
mark
of
indian
summer
the
land
was
nowhere
inhabited
they
saw
the
cabin
of
neither
white
man
nor
indian
a
desolation
and
a
silence
brought
by
the
great
struggle
hung
over
everything
many
discerning
eyes
among
the
riflemen
noted
the
beauty
and
fertility
of
the
country
with
its
noble
forests
and
rich
meadows
at
times
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
river
a
clear
stream
sparkling
under
the
sun
me
think
o
some
o
the
country
down
thar
in
kentucky
said
sol
it
seems
to
me
i
like
one
about
ez
well
ez
say
henry
do
you
think
we
ever
go
back
home
to
me
that
we
always
goin
farther
an
farther
henry
laughed
because
circumstances
have
taken
us
by
the
hand
and
led
us
away
sol
he
replied
said
the
shiftless
one
with
a
resigned
air
hope
them
same
circumstances
will
take
me
by
both
hands
an
lead
me
gently
but
strongly
back
to
a
place
whar
thar
is
peace
an
rest
fur
a
lazy
tired
man
like
think
you
have
to
endure
a
lot
until
next
spring
at
least
said
henry
the
shiftless
one
heaved
a
deep
sigh
but
his
next
words
were
wholly
irrelevant
we
light
on
that
thar
seneca
castle
by
tomorrow
night
he
asked
seems
to
me
that
for
a
lazy
and
tired
man
you
extremely
anxious
for
a
fight
henry
replied
try
to
be
resigned
said
sol
but
his
eyes
were
sparkling
with
the
light
of
battle
they
went
into
camp
that
night
in
a
dense
forest
with
the
seneca
castle
about
ten
miles
ahead
henry
was
quite
sure
that
the
senecas
to
whom
it
belonged
had
not
yet
abandoned
it
and
with
the
aid
of
the
other
tribes
might
make
a
stand
there
it
was
more
than
likely
too
that
the
senecas
had
sharpshooters
and
sentinels
well
to
the
south
of
their
town
and
it
behooved
the
riflemen
to
be
extremely
careful
lest
they
run
into
a
hornet
nest
hence
they
lighted
no
fires
despite
a
cold
night
wind
that
searched
them
through
until
they
wrapped
themselves
in
their
blankets
the
night
settled
down
thick
and
dark
and
the
band
lay
close
in
the
thickets
sol
was
within
a
yard
of
henry
he
had
observed
his
young
leader
face
closely
that
day
and
he
had
a
mind
of
uncommon
penetration
he
whispered
hopin
that
you
find
braxton
wyatt
his
band
at
little
beard
town
among
other
things
replied
henry
in
a
similar
whisper
first
and
the
others
afterwards
persisted
the
shiftless
one
may
be
so
admitted
henry
feel
the
same
way
you
do
said
sol
see
we
knowed
braxton
wyatt
a
long
time
an
it
seems
strange
that
one
who
started
out
a
boy
with
you
an
paul
could
turn
so
black
an
think
uv
all
the
cruel
things
that
he
done
an
helped
to
do
i
ai
hidin
my
feelin
jest
itchin
to
git
at
said
henry
like
for
our
band
to
have
it
out
with
henry
and
sol
and
in
fact
all
of
the
five
slept
that
night
because
henry
wished
to
be
strong
and
vigorous
for
the
following
night
in
view
of
an
enterprise
that
he
had
in
mind
the
rosy
dutchman
heemskerk
was
in
command
of
the
guard
and
he
revolved
continually
about
the
camp
with
amazing
ease
and
with
a
footstep
so
light
that
it
made
no
sound
whatever
now
and
then
he
came
back
in
the
thicket
and
looked
down
at
the
faces
of
the
sleeping
five
from
kentucky
boys
he
murmured
to
himself
boys
to
stay
here
and
help
may
they
go
through
all
our
battles
and
take
no
harm
the
goot
and
great
god
often
watches
over
the
mynheer
cornelius
heemskerk
native
of
holland
but
devoted
to
the
new
nation
of
which
he
had
made
himself
a
part
was
a
devout
man
despite
a
life
of
danger
and
hardship
the
people
of
the
woods
do
not
lose
faith
and
he
looked
up
at
the
dark
skies
as
if
he
found
encouragement
there
then
he
resumed
his
circle
about
the
camp
he
heard
various
hoot
of
an
owl
the
long
whine
of
a
wolf
and
twice
the
footsteps
of
deer
going
down
to
the
river
to
drink
but
the
sounds
were
all
natural
made
by
the
animals
to
which
they
belonged
and
heemskerk
knew
it
once
or
twice
he
went
farther
into
the
forest
but
he
found
nothing
to
indicate
the
presence
of
a
foe
and
while
he
watched
thus
and
beat
up
the
woods
the
night
passed
eventless
away
they
went
the
next
day
much
nearer
to
the
seneca
castle
and
saw
sure
indications
that
it
was
still
inhabited
as
the
iroquois
evidently
were
not
aware
of
the
swift
advance
of
the
riflemen
henry
had
learned
that
this
was
one
of
the
largest
and
strongest
of
all
the
iroquois
towns
containing
between
a
hundred
and
two
hundred
wooden
houses
and
with
a
population
likely
to
be
swollen
greatly
by
fugitives
from
the
iroquois
towns
already
destroyed
the
need
of
caution
great
caution
was
borne
in
upon
him
and
he
paid
good
heed
the
riflemen
sought
another
covert
in
the
deep
forest
now
about
three
miles
from
little
beard
town
and
lay
there
while
henry
according
to
his
plan
went
forth
at
night
with
sol
and
tom
ross
he
was
resolved
to
find
out
more
about
this
important
town
and
his
enterprise
was
in
full
accord
with
his
duties
chief
among
which
was
to
save
the
vanguard
of
the
army
from
ambush
when
the
complete
darkness
of
night
had
come
the
three
left
the
covert
and
after
traveling
a
short
distance
through
the
forest
turned
in
toward
the
river
as
the
town
lay
on
or
near
the
river
henry
thought
they
might
see
some
signs
of
indian
life
on
the
stream
and
from
this
they
could
proceed
to
discoveries
but
when
they
first
saw
the
river
it
was
desolate
not
a
canoe
was
moving
on
its
surface
and
the
three
keeping
well
in
the
undergrowth
followed
the
bank
toward
the
town
but
the
forest
soon
ceased
and
they
came
upon
a
great
field
where
the
senecas
had
raised
corn
and
where
stalks
stripped
of
their
ears
and
browned
by
the
autumn
cold
were
still
standing
but
all
the
work
of
planting
tending
and
reaping
this
great
field
like
all
the
other
work
in
all
the
iroquois
fields
had
been
done
by
the
iroquois
women
not
by
the
warriors
beyond
the
field
they
saw
fruit
trees
and
beyond
these
faint
lines
of
smoke
indicating
the
position
of
the
great
seneca
castle
the
dry
cornstalks
rustled
mournfully
as
the
wind
blew
across
the
field
stalks
will
make
a
little
shelter
said
henry
we
must
cross
the
field
we
want
to
keep
near
the
on
said
sol
they
took
a
diagonal
course
walking
swiftly
among
the
stalks
and
bearing
back
toward
the
river
they
crossed
the
field
without
being
observed
and
came
into
a
thick
fringe
of
trees
and
undergrowth
along
the
river
they
moved
cautiously
in
this
shelter
for
a
rod
or
two
and
then
the
three
without
word
from
any
one
of
them
stopped
simultaneously
they
heard
in
the
water
the
unmistakable
ripple
made
by
a
paddle
and
then
the
sound
of
several
more
they
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
crouched
down
among
the
bushes
then
they
saw
a
singular
procession
a
iroquois
canoes
were
moving
slowly
up
the
stream
they
were
in
single
file
and
the
first
canoe
was
the
largest
but
the
aspect
of
the
little
fleet
was
wholly
different
from
that
of
an
ordinary
group
of
iroquois
war
canoes
it
was
dark
somber
and
funereal
and
in
every
canoe
between
the
feet
of
the
paddlers
lay
a
figure
stiff
and
impassive
the
body
of
a
chief
slain
in
battle
it
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
funeral
procession
but
the
eyes
of
the
three
as
they
roved
over
it
fastened
on
a
figure
in
the
first
canoe
and
used
as
they
were
to
the
strange
and
curious
every
one
of
them
gave
a
start
the
figure
was
that
of
a
woman
a
wild
and
terrible
creature
who
half
sat
half
crouched
in
the
canoe
looking
steadily
downward
her
long
black
hair
fell
in
disordered
masses
from
her
uncovered
head
she
wore
a
brilliant
red
dress
with
savage
adornments
but
it
was
stained
and
torn
the
woman
whole
attitude
expressed
grief
anger
and
despair
esther
whispered
henry
the
other
two
nodded
so
horrifying
had
been
the
impression
made
upon
him
by
this
woman
at
wyoming
that
he
could
not
feel
any
pity
for
her
now
the
picture
of
the
great
war
tomahawk
cleaving
the
heads
of
bound
prisoners
was
still
too
vivid
she
had
several
sons
one
or
two
of
whom
were
slain
in
battle
with
the
colonists
and
the
body
that
lay
in
the
boat
may
have
been
one
of
them
henry
always
believed
that
it
he
still
felt
no
pity
as
the
file
came
nearer
they
heard
her
chanting
a
low
song
and
now
she
raised
her
face
and
tore
at
her
black
hair
goin
to
land
whispered
sol
the
head
of
the
file
was
turned
toward
the
shore
and
as
it
approached
a
group
of
warriors
led
by
little
beard
the
seneca
chief
appeared
among
the
trees
coming
forward
to
meet
them
the
three
in
their
covert
crouched
closer
interested
so
intensely
that
they
were
prepared
to
brave
the
danger
in
order
to
remain
but
the
absorption
of
the
iroquois
in
what
they
were
about
to
do
favored
the
three
scouts
as
the
canoes
touched
the
bank
catharine
montour
rose
from
her
crouching
position
and
uttered
a
long
piercing
wail
so
full
of
grief
rage
and
despair
that
the
three
in
the
bushes
shuddered
it
was
fiercer
than
the
cry
of
a
wolf
and
it
came
back
from
the
dark
forest
in
terrifying
echoes
not
a
woman
but
a
fiend
whispered
henry
and
as
before
his
comrades
nodded
in
assent
the
woman
stood
erect
a
tall
and
stalwart
figure
but
the
beauty
that
had
once
caused
her
to
be
received
in
colonial
capitals
was
long
since
gone
her
white
half
of
blood
had
been
submerged
years
ago
in
her
indian
half
and
there
was
nothing
now
about
her
to
remind
one
of
civilization
or
of
the
french
governor
general
of
canada
who
was
said
to
have
been
her
father
the
iroquois
stood
respectfully
before
her
it
was
evident
that
she
had
lost
none
of
her
power
among
the
six
nations
a
power
proceeding
partly
from
her
force
and
partly
from
superstition
as
the
bodies
were
brought
ashore
one
by
one
and
laid
upon
the
ground
she
uttered
the
long
wailing
cry
again
and
again
and
the
others
repeated
it
in
a
sort
of
chorus
when
the
henry
was
sure
that
they
must
all
be
those
of
laid
out
she
tore
her
hair
sank
down
upon
the
ground
and
began
a
chant
which
tom
ross
was
afterwards
able
to
interpret
roughly
to
the
others
she
sang
the
white
men
have
come
with
the
cannon
and
bayonet
numerous
as
forest
leaves
the
army
has
come
our
warriors
are
driven
like
deer
by
the
hunter
fallen
is
the
league
of
the
our
towns
are
burned
and
our
fields
uprooted
our
people
flee
through
the
forest
for
their
lives
the
king
who
promised
to
help
us
comes
not
fallen
is
the
league
of
the
the
great
chiefs
are
slain
and
their
bodies
lie
here
no
longer
will
they
lead
the
warriors
in
battle
no
more
will
they
drive
the
foe
from
the
thicket
fallen
is
the
league
of
the
scalps
we
have
taken
from
all
who
hated
us
none
but
feared
us
in
the
days
of
our
glory
but
the
cannon
and
bayonet
have
taken
our
country
fallen
is
the
league
of
the
she
chanted
many
verses
but
these
were
all
that
tom
ross
could
ever
remember
or
translate
but
every
verse
ended
with
the
melancholy
refrain
is
the
league
of
the
which
the
others
also
repeated
in
chorus
then
the
warriors
lifted
up
the
bodies
and
they
moved
in
procession
toward
the
town
the
three
watched
them
but
they
did
not
rise
until
the
funeral
train
had
reached
the
fruit
trees
then
they
stood
up
looked
at
one
another
and
breathed
sighs
of
relief
do
care
ef
i
never
see
that
woman
said
sol
gives
me
the
creeps
she
must
be
a
witch
huntin
for
blood
she
is
shore
to
stir
up
the
iroquois
in
this
true
said
henry
i
mean
to
go
said
tom
ross
reckon
that
if
you
mean
it
we
mean
it
are
certainly
tories
in
the
town
said
henry
if
we
are
seen
we
can
probably
pass
for
them
i
bound
to
find
out
what
huntin
fur
braxton
wyatt
said
sol
mean
to
know
if
he
here
said
henry
on
said
the
shiftless
one
they
followed
in
the
path
of
the
procession
which
was
now
out
of
sight
and
entered
the
orchard
from
that
point
they
saw
the
houses
and
great
numbers
of
indians
including
squaws
and
children
gathered
in
the
open
spaces
where
the
funeral
train
was
passing
queen
esther
still
stalked
at
its
head
but
her
chant
was
now
taken
up
by
many
scores
of
voices
and
the
volume
of
sound
penetrated
far
in
the
night
henry
yet
relied
upon
the
absorption
of
the
iroquois
in
this
ceremonial
to
give
him
a
chance
for
a
good
look
through
the
town
and
he
and
his
comrades
advanced
with
boldness
they
passed
by
many
of
the
houses
all
empty
as
their
occupants
had
gone
to
join
in
the
funeral
lament
but
they
soon
saw
white
few
of
the
royal
greens
and
some
of
the
rangers
and
other
tories
who
were
dressed
much
like
henry
and
his
comrades
one
of
them
spoke
to
sol
who
nodded
carelessly
and
passed
by
the
tory
seemed
satisfied
and
went
his
way
us
fur
some
o
the
crowd
that
come
runnin
in
here
ahead
o
the
army
said
the
shiftless
one
henry
was
noting
with
a
careful
eye
the
condition
of
the
town
he
saw
that
no
preparations
for
defense
had
been
made
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
would
be
made
all
was
confusion
and
despair
already
some
of
the
squaws
were
fleeing
carrying
heavy
burdens
the
three
coupled
caution
with
boldness
if
they
met
a
tory
they
merely
exchanged
a
word
or
two
and
passed
swiftly
on
henry
although
he
had
seen
enough
to
know
that
the
army
could
advance
without
hesitation
still
pursued
the
quest
sol
was
right
at
the
bottom
of
henry
heart
was
a
desire
to
know
whether
braxton
wyatt
was
in
little
beard
town
a
desire
soon
satisfied
as
they
reached
the
great
council
house
turned
a
corner
of
it
and
met
the
renegade
face
to
face
wyatt
was
with
his
lieutenant
the
squat
tory
coleman
and
he
uttered
a
cry
when
he
saw
the
tall
figure
of
the
great
youth
there
was
no
light
but
that
of
the
moon
but
he
knew
his
foe
in
an
instant
ware
he
cried
and
snatched
his
pistol
from
his
belt
they
were
so
close
together
that
henry
did
not
have
time
to
use
a
weapon
instinctively
he
struck
out
with
his
fist
catching
wyatt
on
the
jaw
and
sending
him
down
as
if
he
had
been
shot
sol
and
tom
ross
ran
bodily
over
coleman
hurling
him
down
and
leaping
across
his
prostrate
figure
then
they
ran
their
utmost
knowing
that
their
lives
depended
on
speed
and
skill
they
quickly
put
the
council
house
between
them
and
their
pursuers
and
darted
away
among
the
houses
braxton
wyatt
was
stunned
but
he
speedily
regained
his
wits
and
his
feet
was
the
fellow
ware
spying
among
us
again
he
cried
to
his
lieutenant
who
half
dazed
was
also
struggling
up
men
after
them
after
them
a
dozen
men
came
at
his
call
and
led
by
the
renegade
they
began
a
search
among
the
houses
but
it
was
hard
to
find
the
fugitives
the
light
was
not
good
many
flitting
figures
were
about
and
the
frantic
search
developed
confusion
other
tories
were
often
mistaken
for
the
three
scouts
and
were
overhauled
much
to
their
disgust
and
that
of
the
overhaulers
iroquois
drawn
from
the
funeral
ceremony
began
to
join
in
the
hunt
but
wyatt
could
give
them
little
information
he
had
merely
seen
an
enemy
and
then
the
enemy
had
gone
it
was
quite
certain
that
this
enemy
or
rather
three
of
them
was
still
in
the
town
henry
and
his
comrades
were
crafty
trained
by
ambush
and
escape
flight
and
pursuit
they
practiced
many
wiles
to
deceive
their
pursuers
when
wyatt
and
coleman
were
hurled
down
they
ran
around
the
council
house
a
large
and
solid
structure
and
finding
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
and
no
one
there
or
in
sight
from
that
point
they
entered
it
closing
the
door
behind
them
they
stood
in
almost
complete
darkness
although
at
length
they
made
out
the
log
wall
of
the
great
single
room
which
constituted
the
council
house
after
that
with
more
accustomed
eyes
they
saw
on
the
wall
arms
pipes
wampum
and
hideous
trophies
some
with
long
hair
and
some
with
short
the
hair
was
usually
blonde
and
most
of
the
scalps
had
been
stretched
tight
over
little
hoops
henry
clenched
his
fist
in
the
darkness
we
walkin
into
a
trap
here
said
sol
do
think
so
said
henry
any
rate
they
find
us
if
we
were
rushing
about
the
village
here
we
at
least
have
a
at
the
far
end
of
the
council
house
hung
mats
woven
of
rushes
and
the
three
sat
down
behind
them
in
the
very
heart
of
the
iroquois
sanctuary
should
anyone
casually
enter
the
council
house
they
would
still
be
hidden
they
sat
in
turkish
fashion
on
the
floor
close
together
and
with
their
rifles
lying
across
their
knees
a
thin
light
filtered
through
a
window
and
threw
pallid
streaks
on
the
floor
which
they
could
see
when
they
peeped
around
the
edge
of
the
mats
but
outside
they
heard
very
clearly
the
clamor
of
the
hunt
as
it
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
village
sol
chuckled
it
was
very
low
but
it
was
a
chuckle
nevertheless
and
the
others
heard
sorter
takin
an
advantage
uv
said
the
shiftless
one
here
in
thar
own
church
so
to
speak
while
they
ragin
tearin
up
the
earth
everywhar
else
lookin
fur
us
gives
me
a
mighty
snug
feelin
though
like
the
one
you
have
when
you
safe
in
a
big
log
house
an
the
wind
an
the
hail
an
the
snow
are
beatin
shorely
right
sol
said
tom
ross
to
me
continued
the
irrepressible
sol
you
did
git
in
a
good
lick
at
braxton
wyatt
after
all
ai
he
unhappy
now
bitin
his
fingers
an
pawin
the
earth
an
findin
nothin
i
feel
real
sorry
i
do
fur
braxton
it
hard
fur
a
nice
young
feller
to
have
to
suffer
sech
sol
chuckled
again
and
henry
was
forced
to
smile
in
the
darkness
sol
was
not
wholly
wrong
it
would
be
a
bitter
blow
to
braxton
wyatt
moreover
it
was
pleasant
where
they
sat
a
hard
floor
was
soft
to
them
and
as
they
leaned
against
the
wall
they
could
relax
and
rest
will
our
fellows
out
thar
in
the
woods
think
asked
tom
ross
wo
have
to
think
replied
henry
sit
quiet
as
doing
and
the
noise
of
the
hunt
went
on
for
a
long
time
outside
war
whoops
came
from
different
points
of
the
village
there
were
shrill
cries
of
women
and
children
and
the
sound
of
many
running
feet
after
a
while
it
began
to
sink
and
soon
after
that
they
heard
no
more
noises
than
those
of
people
preparing
for
flight
henry
felt
sure
that
the
town
would
be
abandoned
on
the
morrow
but
his
desire
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
braxton
wyatt
was
as
strong
as
ever
it
was
certain
that
the
army
could
not
overtake
wyatt
band
but
he
might
match
his
own
against
it
he
was
thinking
of
making
the
attempt
to
steal
from
the
place
when
to
their
great
amazement
they
heard
the
door
of
the
council
house
open
and
shut
and
then
footsteps
inside
henry
looked
under
the
edge
of
the
hanging
mat
and
saw
two
dusky
figures
near
the
window
chapter
xxiii
the
final
fight
sol
and
tom
ross
were
also
looking
under
the
mats
and
the
three
would
have
recognized
those
figures
anywhere
the
taller
was
timmendiquas
the
other
thayendanegea
the
thin
light
from
the
window
fell
upon
their
faces
and
henry
saw
that
both
were
sad
haughty
and
proud
they
were
still
but
each
bore
the
look
that
comes
only
from
continued
defeat
and
great
disappointment
it
is
truth
to
say
that
the
concealed
three
watched
them
with
a
curiosity
so
intense
that
all
thought
of
their
own
risk
was
forgotten
to
henry
as
well
as
his
comrades
these
two
were
the
greatest
of
all
indian
chiefs
the
white
lightning
of
the
wyandots
and
the
joseph
brant
of
the
mohawks
stood
for
a
space
side
by
side
gazing
out
of
the
window
taking
a
last
look
at
the
great
seneca
castle
it
was
thayendanegea
who
spoke
first
using
wyandot
which
henry
understood
my
brother
great
chief
of
the
wyandots
he
said
have
come
far
with
your
warriors
and
you
have
been
by
our
side
in
battle
the
six
nations
owe
you
much
you
have
helped
us
in
victory
and
you
have
not
deserted
us
in
defeat
you
are
the
greatest
of
warriors
the
boldest
in
battle
and
the
most
timmendiquas
made
a
deprecatory
gesture
but
thayendanegea
went
on
speak
but
the
truth
great
chief
of
the
wyandots
we
owe
you
much
and
some
day
we
may
repay
here
the
bostonians
crowd
us
hard
and
the
mohawks
may
yet
fight
by
your
side
to
save
your
own
hunting
is
true
said
timmendiquas
too
we
must
fight
the
was
long
with
us
here
said
thayendanegea
the
rebels
have
at
last
brought
an
army
against
us
and
the
king
who
persuaded
us
to
make
war
upon
the
americans
adds
nothing
to
the
help
that
he
has
given
us
already
our
white
allies
were
the
first
to
run
at
the
chemung
and
now
the
iroquois
country
so
large
and
so
beautiful
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
invader
we
perish
in
all
the
valleys
our
towns
lie
in
ashes
the
american
army
will
come
and
this
the
great
seneca
castle
the
last
of
our
strongholds
will
also
sink
under
the
flames
i
know
not
how
our
people
will
live
through
the
winter
that
is
yet
to
come
aieroski
has
turned
his
face
from
but
timmendiquas
spoke
words
of
courage
and
hope
six
nations
will
regain
their
country
he
said
great
league
of
the
which
has
been
victorious
for
so
many
generations
can
not
be
destroyed
all
the
tribes
from
here
to
the
mississippi
will
help
and
will
press
down
upon
the
settlements
i
will
return
to
stir
them
anew
and
the
british
posts
will
give
us
arms
and
the
light
of
defiance
shone
once
more
in
the
eyes
of
thayendanegea
raise
my
spirits
again
he
said
flee
now
but
we
shall
come
back
again
the
can
never
submit
we
will
ravage
all
their
settlements
and
burn
and
destroy
we
will
make
a
wilderness
where
they
have
been
the
king
and
his
men
will
yet
give
us
more
part
of
his
words
came
true
and
the
name
of
the
raiding
thayendanegea
was
long
a
terror
but
the
iroquois
who
had
refused
the
requested
neutrality
had
lost
their
country
forever
save
such
portions
as
the
victor
in
the
end
chose
to
offer
to
them
now
as
you
and
your
wyandots
depart
within
the
half
hour
i
give
you
a
last
farewell
said
thayendanegea
the
hands
of
the
two
great
chiefs
met
in
a
clasp
like
that
of
the
white
man
and
then
timmendiquas
abruptly
left
the
council
house
shutting
the
door
behind
him
thayendanegea
lingered
a
while
at
the
window
and
the
look
of
sadness
returned
to
his
face
henry
could
read
many
of
the
thoughts
that
were
passing
through
the
mohawk
proud
mind
thayendanegea
was
thinking
of
his
great
journey
to
london
of
the
power
and
magnificence
that
he
had
seen
of
the
pride
and
glory
of
the
iroquois
of
the
strong
and
numerous
tory
faction
led
by
sir
john
johnson
the
half
brother
of
the
children
of
molly
brant
thayendanegea
own
sister
of
the
butlers
and
all
the
others
who
had
said
that
the
rebels
would
be
easy
to
conquer
he
knew
better
now
he
had
long
known
better
ever
since
that
dreadful
battle
in
the
dark
defile
of
the
oriskany
when
the
palatine
germans
with
old
herkimer
at
their
head
beat
the
tories
the
english
and
the
iroquois
and
made
the
taking
of
burgoyne
possible
the
indian
chieftain
was
a
statesman
and
it
may
be
that
from
this
moment
he
saw
that
the
cause
of
both
the
iroquois
and
their
white
allies
was
doomed
presently
thayendanegea
left
the
window
walking
slowly
toward
the
door
he
paused
there
a
moment
or
two
and
then
went
out
closing
it
behind
him
as
timmendiquas
had
done
the
three
did
not
speak
until
several
minutes
after
he
had
gone
do
believe
said
henry
either
of
them
thinks
despite
their
brave
words
that
the
iroquois
can
ever
win
back
right
said
tom
ross
remember
what
i
saw
at
they
kin
do
it
or
not
said
the
practical
sol
time
for
us
to
git
out
o
here
an
go
back
to
our
words
sol
said
henry
we
examining
first
at
the
window
and
then
through
the
door
opened
slightly
they
saw
that
the
iroquois
village
bad
become
quiet
the
preparations
for
departure
had
probably
ceased
until
morning
forth
stole
the
three
passing
swiftly
among
the
houses
going
with
silent
foot
toward
the
orchard
an
old
squaw
carrying
a
bundle
from
a
house
saw
them
looked
sharply
into
their
faces
and
knew
them
to
be
white
she
threw
down
her
bundle
with
a
fierce
shrill
scream
and
ran
repeating
the
scream
as
she
ran
indians
rushed
out
and
with
them
braxton
wyatt
and
his
band
wyatt
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
tall
figure
with
two
others
one
on
each
side
running
toward
the
orchard
and
he
knew
it
hate
and
the
hope
to
capture
or
kill
swelled
afresh
he
put
a
whistle
to
his
lip
and
blew
shrilly
it
was
a
signal
to
his
band
and
they
came
from
every
point
leading
the
pursuit
henry
heard
the
whistle
and
he
was
quite
sure
that
it
was
wyatt
who
had
made
the
sound
a
single
glance
backward
confirmed
him
he
knew
figure
as
well
as
wyatt
knew
his
and
the
dark
mass
with
him
was
certainly
composed
of
his
own
men
the
other
indians
and
tories
in
all
likelihood
would
turn
back
soon
and
that
fact
would
give
him
the
chance
he
wished
they
were
clear
of
the
town
now
running
lightly
through
the
orchard
and
sol
suggested
that
they
enter
the
woods
at
once
can
soon
dodge
thar
in
the
dark
he
said
do
want
to
dodge
said
henry
the
shiftless
one
was
surprised
but
when
he
glanced
at
henry
face
he
understood
want
to
lead
on
an
to
a
fight
he
said
henry
nodded
you
thought
uv
it
said
sol
they
crossed
the
very
corn
field
through
which
they
had
come
braxton
wyatt
and
his
band
in
full
cry
after
them
several
shots
were
fired
but
the
three
kept
too
far
ahead
for
any
sort
of
marksmanship
and
they
were
not
touched
when
they
finally
entered
the
woods
they
curved
a
little
and
then
keeping
just
far
enough
ahead
to
be
within
sight
but
not
close
enough
for
the
bullets
henry
led
them
straight
toward
the
camp
of
the
riflemen
as
he
approached
he
fired
his
own
rifle
and
uttered
the
long
shout
of
the
forest
runner
he
shouted
a
second
time
and
now
sol
and
tom
ross
joined
in
the
chorus
their
great
cry
penetrating
far
through
the
woods
whether
braxton
wyatt
or
any
of
his
mixed
band
of
indians
and
tories
suspected
the
meaning
of
those
great
shouts
henry
never
knew
but
the
pursuit
came
on
with
undiminished
speed
there
was
a
good
silver
moon
now
shedding
much
light
and
he
saw
wyatt
still
in
the
van
with
his
tory
lieutenant
close
behind
and
after
them
red
men
and
white
spreading
out
like
a
fan
to
inclose
the
fugitives
in
a
trap
the
blood
leaped
in
his
veins
it
was
a
tide
of
fierce
joy
he
had
achieved
both
of
the
purposes
for
which
he
had
come
he
had
thoroughly
scouted
the
seneca
castle
and
he
was
about
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
braxton
wyatt
and
the
band
which
he
had
made
such
a
terror
through
the
valleys
sol
saw
the
face
of
his
young
comrade
and
he
was
startled
he
had
never
before
beheld
it
so
stern
so
resolute
and
so
pitiless
he
seemed
to
remember
as
one
single
fearful
picture
all
the
ruthless
and
terrible
scenes
of
the
last
year
henry
uttered
again
that
cry
which
was
at
once
a
defiance
and
a
signal
and
from
the
forest
ahead
of
him
it
was
answered
signal
for
signal
the
riflemen
were
coming
paul
long
jim
and
heemskerk
at
their
head
they
uttered
a
mighty
cheer
as
they
saw
the
flying
three
and
their
ranks
opened
to
receive
them
from
the
indians
and
tories
came
the
long
whoop
of
challenge
and
every
one
in
either
band
knew
that
the
issue
was
now
about
to
be
settled
by
battle
and
by
battle
alone
they
used
all
the
tactics
of
the
forest
both
sides
instantly
dropped
down
among
the
trees
and
undergrowth
three
or
four
hundred
yards
apart
and
for
a
few
moments
there
was
no
sound
save
heavy
breathing
heard
only
by
those
who
lay
close
by
not
a
single
human
being
would
have
been
visible
to
an
ordinary
eye
there
in
the
moonlight
which
tipped
boughs
and
bushes
with
ghostly
silver
yet
no
area
so
small
ever
held
a
greater
store
of
resolution
and
deadly
animosity
on
one
side
were
the
riflemen
nearly
every
one
of
whom
had
slaughtered
kin
to
mourn
often
wives
and
little
children
and
on
the
other
the
tories
and
iroquois
about
to
lose
their
country
and
swayed
by
the
utmost
passions
of
hate
and
revenge
out
whispered
henry
give
them
a
chance
to
flank
us
you
sol
take
ten
men
and
go
to
the
right
and
you
heemskerk
take
ten
and
go
to
the
is
well
whispered
heemskerk
have
a
great
head
mynheer
each
promptly
obeyed
but
the
larger
number
of
the
riflemen
remained
in
the
center
where
henry
knelt
with
paul
and
long
jim
on
one
side
of
him
and
silent
tom
on
the
other
when
he
thought
that
the
two
flanking
parties
had
reached
the
right
position
he
uttered
a
low
whistle
and
back
came
two
low
whistles
signals
that
all
was
ready
then
the
line
began
its
slow
advance
creeping
forward
from
tree
to
tree
and
from
bush
to
bush
henry
raised
himself
up
a
little
but
he
could
not
yet
see
anything
where
the
hostile
force
lay
hidden
they
went
a
little
farther
and
then
all
lay
down
again
to
look
tom
ross
had
not
spoken
a
word
but
none
was
more
eager
than
he
he
was
almost
flat
upon
the
ground
and
he
had
been
pulling
himself
along
by
a
sort
of
muscular
action
of
his
whole
body
now
he
was
so
still
that
he
did
not
seem
to
breathe
yet
his
eyes
uncommonly
eager
now
were
searching
the
thickets
ahead
they
rested
at
last
on
a
spot
of
brown
showing
through
some
bushes
and
raising
his
rifle
he
fired
with
sure
aim
the
iroquois
uttered
his
death
cry
sprang
up
convulsively
and
then
fell
back
prone
shots
were
fired
in
return
and
a
dozen
riflemen
replied
to
them
the
battle
was
joined
they
heard
braxton
wyatt
whistle
the
challenging
war
cry
of
the
iroquois
and
then
they
fought
in
silence
save
for
the
crack
of
the
rifles
the
riflemen
continued
to
advance
in
slow
creeping
fashion
always
pressing
the
enemy
every
time
they
caught
sight
of
a
hostile
face
or
body
they
sent
a
bullet
at
it
and
wyatt
men
did
the
same
the
two
lines
came
closer
and
all
along
each
there
were
many
sharp
little
jets
of
fire
and
smoke
some
of
the
riflemen
were
wounded
and
two
were
slain
dying
quietly
and
without
interrupting
their
comrades
who
continued
to
press
the
combat
henry
always
leading
in
the
center
and
sol
and
heemskerk
on
the
flanks
this
battle
so
strange
in
which
faces
were
seen
only
for
a
moment
and
which
was
now
without
the
sound
of
voices
continued
without
a
cessation
in
the
dark
forest
the
fury
of
the
combatants
increased
as
the
time
went
on
and
neither
side
was
yet
victorious
closer
and
closer
came
the
lines
meanwhile
dark
clouds
were
piling
in
a
bank
in
the
southwest
slow
thunder
rumbled
far
away
and
the
sky
was
cut
at
intervals
by
lightning
but
the
combatants
did
not
notice
the
heralds
of
storm
their
attention
was
only
for
each
other
it
seemed
to
henry
that
emotions
and
impulses
in
him
had
culminated
before
him
were
the
worst
of
all
their
foes
and
his
pitiless
resolve
was
not
relaxed
a
particle
the
thunder
and
the
lightning
although
he
did
not
notice
them
seemed
to
act
upon
him
as
an
incitement
and
with
low
words
he
continually
urged
those
about
him
to
push
the
battle
drops
of
rain
fell
showing
in
the
moonshine
like
beads
of
silver
on
boughs
and
twigs
but
by
and
by
the
smoke
from
the
rifle
fire
pressed
down
by
the
heavy
atmosphere
gathered
among
the
trees
and
the
moon
was
partly
hidden
but
file
combat
did
not
relax
because
of
the
obscurity
wandering
indians
hearing
the
firing
came
to
wyatt
relief
but
despite
their
aid
he
was
compelled
to
give
ground
his
were
the
most
desperate
and
hardened
men
red
and
white
in
all
the
allied
forces
but
they
were
faced
by
sharpshooters
better
than
themselves
many
of
them
were
already
killed
others
were
wounded
and
although
wyatt
and
coleman
raged
and
strove
to
hold
them
they
began
to
give
back
and
so
hard
pressed
were
they
that
the
iroquois
could
not
perform
the
sacred
duty
of
carrying
off
their
dead
no
one
sought
to
carry
away
the
tories
who
lay
with
the
rain
that
had
now
begun
to
fall
beating
upon
them
so
much
had
the
riflemen
advanced
that
they
came
to
the
point
where
bodies
of
their
enemies
lay
again
that
fierce
joy
surged
up
in
heart
his
friends
and
he
were
winning
but
he
wished
to
do
more
than
win
this
band
if
left
alone
would
merely
flee
from
the
seneca
castle
before
the
advance
of
the
army
and
would
still
exist
to
ravage
and
slay
elsewhere
on
tom
keep
on
he
cried
to
ross
and
the
others
let
them
rest
wo
we
ai
dreamin
o
doin
sech
a
thing
replied
the
redoubtable
one
as
he
loaded
and
fired
i
got
another
the
iroquois
yielding
slowly
at
first
began
now
to
give
way
faster
some
sought
to
dart
away
to
right
or
left
and
bury
themselves
in
the
forest
but
they
were
caught
by
the
flanking
parties
of
sol
and
heemskerk
and
driven
back
on
the
center
they
could
not
retreat
except
straight
on
the
town
and
the
riflemen
followed
them
step
for
step
the
moan
of
the
distant
thunder
went
on
and
the
soft
rain
fell
but
the
deadly
crackle
of
the
rifles
formed
a
sharper
insistent
note
that
claimed
the
whole
attention
of
both
combatants
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
riflemen
to
receive
help
twenty
or
more
scouts
and
others
abroad
in
the
forest
were
called
by
the
rifle
fire
and
went
at
once
into
the
battle
then
wyatt
was
helped
a
second
time
by
a
band
of
senecas
and
mohawks
but
despite
all
the
aid
they
could
not
withstand
the
riflemen
wyatt
black
with
fury
and
despair
shouted
to
them
and
sometimes
cursed
or
even
struck
at
them
but
the
retreat
could
not
be
stopped
men
fell
fast
every
one
of
the
riflemen
was
a
sharpshooter
and
few
bullets
missed
wyatt
was
driven
out
of
the
forest
and
into
the
very
corn
field
through
which
henry
had
passed
here
the
retreat
became
faster
and
with
shouts
of
triumph
the
riflemen
followed
after
wyatt
lost
some
men
in
the
flight
through
the
field
but
when
he
came
to
the
orchard
having
the
advantage
of
cover
he
made
another
desperate
stand
but
sol
and
heemskerk
took
the
band
on
the
flanks
pouring
in
a
destructive
fire
and
wyatt
coleman
and
a
fourth
of
his
band
all
that
survived
broke
into
a
run
for
the
town
the
riflemen
uttered
shout
after
shout
of
triumph
and
it
was
impossible
to
restrain
their
pursuit
henry
would
have
stopped
here
knowing
the
danger
of
following
into
the
town
especially
when
the
army
was
near
at
band
with
an
irresistible
force
but
he
could
not
stay
them
he
decided
then
that
if
they
would
charge
it
must
be
done
with
the
utmost
fire
and
spirit
men
on
he
cried
them
no
chance
to
take
sol
and
heemskerk
wheeled
in
with
the
flanking
parties
and
the
riflemen
a
solid
mass
now
increased
the
speed
of
pursuit
wyatt
and
his
men
had
no
chance
to
turn
and
fire
or
even
to
reload
bullets
beat
upon
them
as
they
fled
and
here
perished
nearly
all
of
that
savage
band
wyatt
coleman
and
only
a
half
dozen
made
good
the
town
where
a
portion
of
the
iroquois
who
had
not
yet
fled
received
them
but
the
exultant
riflemen
did
not
stop
even
there
they
were
hot
on
the
heels
of
wyatt
and
the
fugitives
and
attacked
at
once
the
iroquois
who
came
to
their
relief
so
fierce
was
their
rush
that
these
new
forces
were
driven
back
at
once
braxton
wyatt
coleman
and
a
dozen
more
seeing
no
other
escape
fled
to
a
large
log
house
used
as
a
granary
threw
themselves
into
it
barred
the
doors
heavily
and
began
to
fire
from
the
upper
windows
small
openings
usually
closed
with
boards
other
indians
from
the
covert
of
house
tepee
or
tree
fired
upon
the
assailants
and
a
fresh
battle
began
in
the
town
the
riflemen
directed
by
their
leaders
met
the
new
situation
promptly
fired
upon
from
all
sides
at
least
twenty
rushed
into
a
house
some
forty
yards
from
that
of
braxton
wyatt
others
seized
another
house
while
the
rest
remained
outside
sheltered
by
little
outhouses
trees
or
inequalities
of
the
earth
and
maintained
rapid
sharpshooting
in
reply
to
the
iroquois
in
the
town
or
to
braxton
wyatt
men
in
the
house
now
the
combat
became
fiercer
than
ever
the
warriors
uttered
yells
and
wyatt
men
in
the
house
sent
forth
defiant
shouts
from
another
part
of
the
town
came
shrill
cries
of
old
squaws
urging
on
their
fighting
men
it
was
now
about
four
in
the
morning
the
thunder
and
lightning
had
ceased
but
the
soft
rain
was
still
falling
the
indians
had
lighted
fires
some
distance
away
several
carried
torches
helped
by
these
and
used
so
long
to
the
night
the
combatants
saw
distinctly
the
five
lay
behind
a
low
embankment
and
they
paid
their
whole
attention
to
the
big
house
that
sheltered
wyatt
and
his
men
on
the
sides
and
behind
they
were
protected
by
heemskerk
and
others
who
faced
a
coming
swarm
low
paul
said
henry
restraining
his
eager
comrade
fellows
in
the
house
can
shoot
and
we
do
want
to
lose
you
there
did
i
tell
you
a
bullet
fired
from
the
window
passed
through
the
top
of
paul
cap
but
clipped
only
his
hair
before
the
flash
from
the
window
passed
long
jim
fired
in
return
and
something
fell
back
inside
bullets
came
from
other
windows
sol
fired
and
a
seneca
fell
forward
banging
half
out
of
the
window
his
naked
body
a
glistening
brown
in
the
firelight
but
he
hung
only
a
few
seconds
then
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
lay
still
the
five
crouched
low
again
waiting
a
new
opportunity
behind
them
and
on
either
side
they
heard
the
crash
of
the
new
battle
and
challenging
cries
braxton
wyatt
coleman
four
more
tories
and
six
indians
were
still
alive
in
the
strong
log
house
two
or
three
were
wounded
but
they
scarcely
noticed
it
in
the
passion
of
conflict
the
house
was
a
veritable
fortress
and
the
renegade
hopes
rose
high
as
he
heard
the
rifle
fire
from
different
parts
of
the
town
his
own
band
had
been
annihilated
by
the
riflemen
led
by
henry
ware
but
he
had
a
sanguine
hope
now
that
his
enemies
had
rushed
into
a
trap
the
iroquois
would
turn
back
and
destroy
them
wyatt
and
his
comrades
presented
a
repellent
sight
as
they
crouched
in
the
room
and
fired
from
the
two
little
windows
his
clothes
and
those
of
the
white
men
had
been
torn
by
bushes
and
briars
in
their
flight
and
their
faces
had
been
raked
too
until
they
bled
but
they
had
paid
no
attention
to
such
wounds
and
the
blood
was
mingled
with
sweat
and
powder
smoke
the
indians
naked
to
the
waist
daubed
with
vermilion
and
streaked
too
with
blood
crouched
upon
the
floor
with
the
of
their
rifles
at
the
windows
seeking
something
human
to
kill
one
and
all
red
and
white
they
were
now
raging
savages
there
was
not
one
among
them
who
did
not
have
some
foul
murder
of
woman
or
child
to
his
credit
wyatt
himself
was
mad
for
revenge
every
evil
passion
in
him
was
up
and
leaping
his
eyes
more
like
those
of
a
wild
animal
than
a
human
being
blazed
out
of
a
face
a
mottled
red
and
black
by
the
side
of
him
the
dark
tory
coleman
was
driven
by
impulses
fully
as
fierce
think
of
it
exclaimed
wyatt
led
us
directly
into
a
trap
that
ware
and
here
our
band
is
destroyed
all
the
good
men
that
we
gathered
together
except
these
few
are
killed
we
may
pay
them
back
said
coleman
were
in
their
trap
but
now
they
are
in
ours
listen
to
that
firing
and
the
war
whoop
there
are
enough
iroquois
yet
in
the
town
to
kill
every
one
of
those
rebels
hope
so
i
believe
so
exclaimed
wyatt
out
coleman
ah
pinked
you
that
the
one
they
call
sol
and
he
the
best
sharpshooter
of
them
all
except
ware
coleman
had
leaned
forward
a
little
in
his
anxiety
to
secure
a
good
aim
at
something
he
had
disclosed
only
a
little
of
his
face
but
in
an
instant
a
bullet
had
seared
his
forehead
like
the
flaming
stroke
of
a
sword
passing
on
and
burying
itself
in
the
wall
fresh
blood
dripped
down
over
his
face
he
tore
a
strip
from
the
inside
of
his
coat
bound
it
about
his
head
and
went
on
with
the
defense
a
mohawk
frightfully
painted
fired
from
the
other
window
like
a
flash
came
the
return
shot
and
the
indian
fell
back
in
the
room
stone
dead
with
a
bullet
through
his
bead
was
ware
himself
said
wyatt
told
you
he
was
the
best
shot
of
them
all
i
give
him
that
credit
but
they
all
good
look
out
there
goes
another
of
our
men
it
was
ross
who
did
that
i
tell
you
be
careful
be
careful
it
was
an
onondaga
who
fell
this
time
and
he
lay
with
his
head
on
the
window
sill
until
another
indian
pulled
him
inside
a
minute
later
a
tory
who
peeped
guardedly
for
a
shot
received
a
bullet
through
his
head
and
sank
down
on
the
floor
a
sort
of
terror
spread
among
the
others
what
could
they
do
in
the
face
of
such
terrible
sharpshooting
it
was
uncanny
almost
superhuman
and
they
looked
stupidly
at
one
another
smoke
from
their
own
firing
had
gathered
in
the
room
and
it
formed
a
ghastly
veil
about
their
faces
they
heard
the
crash
of
the
rifles
outside
from
every
point
but
no
help
came
to
them
bound
to
do
something
exclaimed
wyatt
you
jones
stick
up
the
edge
of
your
cap
and
when
they
fire
at
it
i
put
a
bullet
in
the
man
who
pulls
the
jones
thrust
up
his
cap
but
they
knew
too
much
out
there
to
be
taken
in
by
an
old
trick
the
cap
remained
unhurt
but
when
jones
in
his
eagerness
thrust
it
higher
until
he
exposed
his
arm
his
wrist
was
smashed
in
an
instant
by
a
bullet
and
he
fell
back
with
a
howl
of
pain
wyatt
swore
and
bit
his
lips
savagely
he
and
all
of
them
began
to
fear
that
they
were
in
another
and
tighter
trap
one
from
which
there
was
no
escape
unless
the
iroquois
outside
drove
off
the
riflemen
and
of
that
they
could
as
yet
see
no
sign
the
sharpshooters
held
their
place
behind
the
embankment
and
the
little
outhouse
and
so
little
as
a
finger
even
at
the
windows
became
a
sure
mark
for
their
terrible
bullets
a
seneca
seeking
a
new
trial
for
a
shot
received
a
bullet
through
the
shoulder
and
a
tory
who
followed
him
in
the
effort
was
slain
outright
the
light
hitherto
had
been
from
the
fires
but
now
the
dawn
was
coming
pale
gray
beams
fell
over
the
town
and
then
deepened
into
red
and
yellow
the
beams
reached
the
room
where
the
beleaguered
remains
of
wyatt
band
fought
but
mingling
with
the
smoke
they
gave
a
new
and
more
ghastly
tint
to
the
desperate
faces
got
to
fight
exclaimed
wyatt
ca
sit
here
and
be
taken
like
beasts
in
a
trap
suppose
we
unbar
the
doors
below
and
make
a
rush
for
it
coleman
shook
his
head
one
of
us
would
be
killed
within
twenty
yards
he
said
the
iroquois
must
come
back
cried
wyatt
is
joe
brant
where
is
timmendiquas
and
where
is
that
coward
sir
john
johnson
will
they
come
wo
come
said
coleman
they
lay
still
awhile
listening
to
the
firing
in
the
town
which
swayed
hither
and
thither
the
smoke
in
the
room
thinned
somewhat
and
the
daylight
broadened
and
deepened
as
a
desperate
resort
they
resumed
fire
from
the
windows
but
three
more
of
their
number
were
slain
and
bitter
with
chagrin
they
crouched
once
more
on
the
floor
out
of
range
wyatt
looked
at
the
figures
of
the
living
and
the
dead
savage
despair
tore
at
his
heart
again
and
his
hatred
of
those
who
bad
done
this
increased
it
was
being
served
out
to
him
and
his
band
as
they
had
served
it
out
to
many
a
defenseless
family
in
the
beautiful
valleys
of
the
border
despite
the
sharpshooters
he
took
another
look
at
the
window
but
kept
so
far
back
that
there
was
no
chance
for
a
shot
of
them
are
slipping
away
he
exclaimed
are
ross
and
the
one
they
call
long
jim
i
wish
i
dared
a
shot
now
they
gone
they
lay
again
in
silence
for
a
time
there
was
still
firing
in
the
town
and
now
and
then
they
heard
shouts
wyatt
looked
at
his
lieutenant
and
his
lieutenant
looked
at
him
is
the
ugliest
face
i
ever
saw
said
wyatt
can
say
the
same
of
i
ca
see
mine
said
coleman
the
two
gazed
once
more
at
the
hideous
streaked
and
grimed
faces
of
each
other
and
then
laughed
wildly
a
wounded
seneca
sitting
with
his
back
against
the
wall
began
to
chant
a
low
wailing
death
song
up
stop
that
infernal
noise
exclaimed
wyatt
savagely
the
seneca
stared
at
him
with
fixed
glassy
eyes
and
continued
his
chant
wyatt
turned
away
but
that
song
was
upon
his
nerves
he
knew
that
everything
was
lost
the
main
force
of
the
iroquois
would
not
come
back
to
his
help
and
henry
ware
would
triumph
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
muttered
fierce
words
under
his
breath
suddenly
exclaimed
coleman
is
that
a
low
crackling
sound
came
to
their
ears
and
both
recognized
it
instantly
it
was
the
sound
of
flames
eating
rapidly
into
wood
and
of
that
wood
was
built
the
house
they
now
held
even
as
they
listened
they
could
hear
the
flames
leap
and
roar
into
new
and
larger
life
is
what
those
two
ross
and
hart
were
up
to
exclaimed
wyatt
not
only
trapped
but
we
to
be
burned
alive
in
our
trap
i
said
coleman
goin
to
make
a
rush
for
the
only
thing
to
be
done
said
wyatt
all
of
you
that
are
left
the
scanty
survivors
gathered
around
him
all
but
the
wounded
seneca
who
sat
unmoved
against
the
wall
and
continued
to
chant
his
death
chant
wyatt
glanced
at
him
but
said
nothing
then
he
and
the
others
rushed
down
the
stairs
the
lower
room
was
filled
with
smoke
and
outside
the
flames
were
roaring
they
unbarred
the
door
and
sprang
into
the
open
air
a
shower
of
bullets
met
them
the
tory
coleman
uttered
a
choking
cry
threw
up
his
arms
and
fell
back
in
the
doorway
braxton
wyatt
seized
one
of
the
smaller
men
and
holding
him
a
moment
or
two
before
him
to
receive
the
fire
of
his
foe
dashed
for
the
corner
of
the
blazing
building
the
man
whom
he
held
was
slain
and
his
own
shoulder
was
grazed
twice
but
he
made
the
corner
in
an
instant
he
put
the
burning
building
between
him
and
his
pursuers
and
ran
as
he
had
never
run
before
in
all
his
life
deadly
fear
putting
wings
on
his
heels
as
he
ran
he
heard
the
dull
boom
of
a
cannon
and
he
knew
that
the
american
army
was
entering
the
seneca
castle
ahead
of
him
he
saw
the
last
of
the
indians
fleeing
for
the
woods
and
behind
him
the
burning
house
crashed
and
fell
in
amid
leaping
flames
and
sparks
in
myriads
he
alone
had
escaped
from
the
house
chapter
xxiv
down
the
ohio
did
get
wyatt
said
henry
we
did
pretty
well
so
said
sol
nothin
left
o
his
band
but
hisself
an
i
ai
feelin
any
sorrow
i
helped
to
do
it
i
guess
we
saved
the
lives
of
a
good
many
innocent
people
with
this
morning
a
doubt
of
it
said
henry
here
the
army
now
finishing
up
the
the
soldiers
were
setting
fire
to
the
town
in
many
places
and
in
two
hours
the
great
seneca
castle
was
wholly
destroyed
the
five
took
no
part
in
this
but
rested
after
their
battles
and
labors
one
or
two
had
been
grazed
by
bullets
but
the
wounds
were
too
trifling
to
be
noticed
as
they
rested
they
watched
the
fire
which
was
an
immense
one
fed
by
so
much
material
the
blaze
could
be
seen
for
many
miles
and
the
ashes
drifted
over
all
the
forest
beyond
the
fields
all
the
while
the
iroquois
were
fleeing
through
the
wilderness
to
the
british
posts
and
the
country
beyond
the
lakes
whence
their
allies
had
already
preceded
them
the
coals
of
little
beard
town
smoldered
for
two
or
three
days
and
then
the
army
turned
back
retracing
its
steps
down
the
genesee
henry
and
his
comrades
felt
that
their
work
in
the
east
was
finished
kentucky
was
calling
to
them
they
had
no
doubt
that
braxton
wyatt
now
that
his
band
was
destroyed
would
return
there
and
he
would
surely
be
plotting
more
danger
it
was
their
part
to
meet
and
defeat
him
they
wished
too
to
see
again
the
valley
the
river
and
the
village
in
which
their
people
had
made
their
home
and
they
wished
yet
more
to
look
upon
the
faces
of
these
people
they
left
the
army
went
southward
with
heemskerk
and
some
others
of
the
riflemen
but
at
the
susquehanna
parted
with
the
gallant
dutchman
and
his
comrades
is
good
to
me
to
have
known
you
my
brave
friends
said
heemskerk
i
say
with
sorrow
to
you
mynheer
henry
to
you
mynheer
paul
to
you
mynheer
sol
to
you
mynheer
tom
and
to
you
mynheer
he
wrung
their
hands
one
by
one
and
then
revolved
swiftly
away
to
hide
his
emotion
the
five
rifles
on
their
shoulders
started
through
the
forest
when
they
looked
back
they
saw
cornelius
heemskerk
waving
his
hand
to
them
they
waved
in
return
and
then
disappeared
in
the
forest
it
was
a
long
journey
to
pittsburgh
but
they
found
it
a
pleasant
one
it
was
yet
deep
autumn
on
the
pennsylvania
hills
and
the
forest
was
glowing
with
scarlet
and
gold
the
air
was
the
very
wine
of
life
and
when
they
needed
game
it
was
there
to
be
shot
as
the
cold
weather
hung
off
they
did
not
hurry
and
they
enjoyed
the
peace
of
the
forest
they
realized
now
that
after
their
vast
labors
hardships
and
dangers
they
needed
a
great
rest
and
they
took
it
it
was
singular
and
perhaps
not
so
singular
how
their
minds
turned
from
battle
pursuit
and
escape
to
gentle
things
a
little
brook
or
fountain
pleased
them
they
admired
the
magnificent
colors
of
the
foliage
and
lingered
over
the
views
from
the
low
mountains
doe
and
fawn
fled
from
them
but
without
cause
at
night
they
built
splendid
fires
and
sat
before
them
while
everyone
in
his
turn
told
tales
according
to
his
nature
or
experience
they
bought
at
pittsburgh
a
strong
boat
partly
covered
and
at
the
point
where
the
allegheny
and
the
monongahela
unite
they
set
sail
down
the
ohio
it
was
winter
now
but
in
their
stout
caravel
they
did
not
care
they
had
ample
supplies
of
all
kinds
including
ammunition
and
their
hearts
were
light
when
they
swung
into
the
middle
of
the
ohio
and
moved
with
its
current
for
a
great
voyage
said
paul
looking
at
the
clear
stream
with
sparkling
eyes
wonder
what
it
will
bring
to
us
said
sol
shall
see

henry
