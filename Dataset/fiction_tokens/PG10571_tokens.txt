of
the
sea

to
do
said
george
wright
as
he
leaned
towards
the
old
sailor
is
to
be
an
uncle
to
me
aye
aye
said
the
mystified
kemp
pausing
with
a
mug
of
beer
midway
to
his
lips
a
rich
uncle
continued
the
young
man
lowering
his
voice
to
prevent
any
keen
ears
in
the
next
bar
from
acquiring
useless
knowledge
an
uncle
from
new
zealand
who
is
going
to
leave
me
all
money
where
it
coming
from
demanded
kemp
with
a
little
excitement
it
ai
coming
was
the
reply
you
only
got
to
say
you
got
it
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
got
my
eye
on
a
young
lady
there
another
chap
after
too
and
if
she
thought
i
got
a
rich
uncle
it
might
make
all
the
difference
she
knows
i
an
uncle
that
went
to
new
zealand
and
was
never
heard
of
since
that
what
made
me
think
of
it
kemp
drank
his
beer
in
thoughtful
silence
how
can
i
be
a
rich
uncle
without
any
brass
he
inquired
at
length
i
should
to
lend
you
some
a
little
said
wright
illustration
what
i
want
you
to
do
said
george
wright
is
to
be
an
uncle
to
me
the
old
man
pondered
i
had
money
lent
me
before
he
said
candidly
but
i
ca
call
to
mind
ever
paying
it
back
i
always
meant
to
but
that
as
far
as
it
got
it
do
matter
said
the
other
it
only
be
for
a
little
while
and
then
you
a
letter
calling
you
back
to
new
zealand
see
and
you
go
back
promising
to
come
home
in
a
year
time
after
wound
up
your
business
and
leave
us
all
your
money
see
kemp
scratched
the
back
of
his
neck
but
she
sure
to
find
it
out
in
time
he
objected
said
wright
and
not
there
be
plenty
of
time
for
me
to
get
married
before
she
does
and
you
could
write
back
and
say
you
had
got
married
yourself
or
given
your
money
to
a
hospital
he
ordered
some
more
beer
for
kemp
and
in
a
low
voice
gave
him
as
much
of
the
family
history
as
he
considered
necessary
i
only
known
you
for
about
ten
days
he
concluded
but
i
sooner
trust
you
than
people
i
known
for
years
i
took
a
fancy
to
you
the
moment
i
set
eyes
on
you
rejoined
kemp
you
the
living
image
of
a
young
fellow
that
lent
me
five
pounds
once
and
was
drowned
afore
my
eyes
the
week
after
he
a
bit
of
a
squint
and
i
that
how
he
came
to
fall
overboard
he
emptied
his
mug
and
then
accompanied
by
wright
fetched
his
chest
from
the
where
he
was
staying
and
took
it
to
the
young
man
lodgings
fortunately
for
the
latter
pocket
the
chest
contained
a
good
best
suit
and
boots
and
the
only
expenses
incurred
were
for
a
large
soft
felt
hat
and
a
gilded
watch
and
chain
dressed
in
his
best
with
a
bulging
in
his
he
set
out
with
wright
on
the
following
evening
to
make
his
first
call
wright
who
was
also
in
his
best
clothes
led
the
way
to
a
small
tobacconist
in
a
side
street
off
the
mile
end
road
and
raising
his
hat
with
some
ceremony
shook
hands
with
a
young
woman
who
stood
behind
the
counter
kemp
adopting
an
air
of
scornful
dignity
intended
to
indicate
the
possession
of
great
wealth
waited
this
is
my
uncle
said
wright
speaking
rapidly
from
new
zealand
the
one
i
spoke
to
you
about
he
turned
up
last
night
and
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
expected
to
see
kemp
in
a
good
rolling
voice
said
good
evening
miss
i
hope
you
are
well
and
subsiding
into
a
chair
asked
for
a
cigar
his
surprise
when
he
found
that
the
best
cigar
they
stocked
only
cost
sixpence
almost
assumed
the
dimensions
of
a
grievance
it
do
to
go
on
with
he
said
smelling
it
suspiciously
have
you
got
change
for
a
note
miss
bradshaw
concealing
her
surprise
by
an
effort
said
that
she
would
see
and
was
scanning
the
contents
of
a
drawer
when
kemp
in
some
haste
discovered
a
few
odd
sovereigns
in
his
five
minutes
later
he
was
sitting
in
the
little
room
behind
the
shop
holding
forth
to
an
admiring
audience
so
far
as
i
know
he
said
in
reply
to
a
question
of
bradshaw
george
is
the
only
relation
i
got
him
and
me
are
quite
alone
and
i
can
tell
you
i
was
glad
to
find
him
bradshaw
sighed
it
a
pity
you
are
so
far
apart
she
said
it
not
for
long
said
kemp
i
just
going
back
for
about
a
year
to
wind
up
things
out
there
and
then
i
coming
back
to
leave
my
old
bones
over
here
george
has
very
kindly
offered
to
let
me
live
with
him
he
wo
suffer
for
it
i
be
bound
said
bradshaw
archly
so
far
as
money
goes
he
wo
said
the
old
man
not
that
that
would
make
any
difference
to
george
it
would
be
the
same
to
me
if
you
had
got
a
farthing
said
wright
promptly
illustration
it
do
to
go
on
with
he
said
kemp
somewhat
affected
shook
hands
with
him
and
leaning
back
in
the
most
comfortable
chair
in
the
room
described
his
life
and
struggles
in
new
zealand
hard
work
teetotalism
and
the
simple
life
combined
appeared
to
be
responsible
for
a
fortune
which
he
affected
to
be
too
old
to
enjoy
misunderstandings
of
a
painful
nature
were
avoided
by
a
timely
admission
that
under
medical
advice
he
was
now
taking
a
fair
amount
of
stimulant
illustration
much
did
you
say
you
got
in
the
bank
mind
he
said
as
he
walked
home
with
the
elated
george
it
your
game
not
mine
and
it
sure
to
come
a
bit
expensive
i
ca
be
a
rich
uncle
without
spending
a
bit
much
did
you
say
you
got
in
the
bank
we
must
be
as
careful
as
we
can
said
wright
hastily
one
thing
is
they
ca
leave
the
shop
to
go
out
much
it
a
very
good
little
business
and
it
ought
to
be
all
right
for
me
and
bella
one
of
these
days
eh
kemp
prompted
by
a
nudge
in
the
ribs
assented
it
wonderful
how
they
took
it
all
in
about
me
he
said
but
i
feel
certain
in
my
own
mind
that
i
ought
to
chuck
some
money
about
tell
of
the
money
you
have
chucked
about
said
wright
do
just
as
well
and
come
a
good
deal
cheaper
and
you
had
better
go
round
alone
evening
it
look
better
just
go
in
for
another
one
of
their
sixpenny
cigars
kemp
obeyed
and
the
following
evening
after
sitting
a
little
while
chatting
in
the
shop
was
invited
into
the
parlour
where
mindful
of
wright
instructions
he
held
his
listeners
enthralled
by
tales
of
past
expenditure
a
tip
of
fifty
pounds
to
his
bedroom
steward
coming
over
was
characterized
by
bradshaw
as
extravagant
seems
to
be
going
all
right
said
wright
as
the
old
man
made
his
report
but
be
careful
do
go
overdoing
it
kemp
nodded
i
can
turn
round
my
little
finger
he
said
you
have
bella
all
to
yourself
evening
wright
flushed
how
did
you
manage
that
he
inquired
it
the
first
time
she
has
ever
been
out
with
me
alone
she
ai
coming
out
said
kemp
she
going
to
stay
at
home
and
mind
the
shop
it
the
mother
what
coming
out
going
to
spend
the
evening
with
me
wright
frowned
what
did
you
do
that
for
he
demanded
hotly
i
did
do
it
said
kemp
equably
they
done
it
the
old
lady
says
that
just
for
once
in
her
life
she
wants
to
see
how
it
feels
to
spend
money
like
water
i
money
like
water
repeated
the
horrified
wright
money
like
i
her
i
it
do
matter
to
me
said
kemp
i
can
have
a
headache
or
a
chill
or
something
of
that
sort
if
you
like
i
do
want
to
go
no
pleasure
to
me
what
will
it
cost
demanded
wright
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
the
rich
uncle
made
a
calculation
she
wants
to
go
to
a
place
called
the
empire
he
said
slowly
and
have
something
for
supper
and
be
cabs
and
things
i
dessay
it
would
cost
a
couple
o
pounds
and
it
might
be
more
but
i
just
as
soon
ave
a
chill
just
wright
groaned
and
after
talking
of
bradshaw
as
though
she
were
already
his
produced
the
money
his
instructions
as
to
economy
lasted
almost
up
to
the
moment
when
he
stood
with
bella
outside
the
shop
on
the
following
evening
and
watched
the
couple
go
off
it
wonderful
how
well
they
get
on
together
said
bella
as
they
the
shop
and
passed
into
the
parlour
i
never
seen
mother
take
to
anybody
so
quick
as
she
has
to
him
i
hope
you
like
him
too
said
wright
he
a
dear
said
bella
fancy
having
all
that
money
i
wonder
what
it
feels
like
i
suppose
i
shall
know
some
day
said
the
young
man
slowly
but
it
wo
be
much
good
to
me
unless
unless
said
bella
after
a
pause
unless
it
gives
me
what
i
want
replied
the
other
i
sooner
be
a
poor
man
and
married
to
the
girl
i
love
than
a
millionaire
miss
bradshaw
stole
an
uneasy
glance
at
his
somewhat
sallow
features
and
became
thoughtful
it
no
good
having
diamonds
and
and
that
sort
of
thing
unless
you
have
somebody
to
share
them
with
pursued
wright
miss
bradshaw
eyes
sparkled
and
at
that
moment
the
tinkled
and
a
lively
whistle
sounded
she
rose
and
went
into
the
shop
and
wright
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
scowled
darkly
as
he
saw
the
intruder
good
evening
said
the
latter
i
want
a
sixpenny
smoke
for
twopence
please
how
are
we
this
evening
sitting
up
and
taking
nourishment
miss
bradshaw
told
him
to
behave
himself
always
do
said
the
young
man
that
why
i
can
never
get
anybody
to
play
with
i
had
such
an
awful
dream
about
you
last
night
that
i
could
rest
till
i
saw
you
awful
it
was
what
was
it
inquired
miss
bradshaw
dreamt
you
were
married
said
hills
smiling
at
her
miss
bradshaw
tossed
her
head
who
to
pray
she
inquired
me
said
hills
simply
i
woke
up
in
a
cold
perspiration
halloa
is
that
georgie
in
there
how
are
you
george
better
i
all
right
said
wright
with
dignity
as
the
other
hooked
the
door
open
with
his
stick
and
nodded
at
him
well
why
do
you
look
it
demanded
the
lively
hills
have
you
got
your
feet
wet
or
what
oh
be
quiet
said
miss
bradshaw
smiling
at
him
said
hills
dropping
into
a
chair
by
the
counter
and
caressing
his
moustache
but
you
would
speak
to
me
like
that
if
you
knew
what
a
terrible
day
i
had
what
have
you
been
doing
asked
the
girl
working
said
the
other
with
a
huge
sigh
where
the
millionaire
i
came
round
on
purpose
to
have
a
look
at
him
him
and
mother
have
gone
to
the
empire
said
miss
bradshaw
hills
gave
three
long
penetrating
whistles
and
then
placing
his
cigar
with
great
care
on
the
counter
hid
his
face
in
a
huge
handkerchief
miss
bradshaw
glanced
from
him
to
the
frowning
wright
and
then
entering
the
parlour
closed
the
door
with
a
bang
hills
took
the
hint
and
with
a
somewhat
thoughtful
grin
departed
he
came
in
next
evening
for
another
cigar
and
heard
all
that
there
was
to
hear
about
the
empire
bradshaw
would
have
treated
him
but
coldly
but
the
innocent
kemp
charmed
by
his
manner
paid
him
great
attention
he
just
like
what
i
was
at
his
age
he
said
lively
i
not
a
patch
on
you
said
hills
edging
his
way
by
slow
degrees
into
the
parlour
i
do
take
young
ladies
to
the
empire
were
you
telling
me
you
came
over
here
to
get
married
or
did
i
dream
it
at
him
said
the
blushing
kemp
as
bradshaw
shook
her
head
at
the
offender
and
told
him
to
behave
himself
he
a
man
any
woman
might
be
happy
with
said
hills
he
never
knows
how
much
there
is
in
his
fancy
sewing
on
buttons
for
a
man
like
that
ai
in
it
bradshaw
shook
her
head
at
him
again
and
hills
after
apologizing
to
her
for
revealing
her
innermost
thoughts
before
the
most
guileless
of
men
began
to
question
kemp
as
to
the
prospects
of
a
bright
and
energetic
young
man
with
a
distaste
for
work
in
new
zealand
the
audience
listened
with
keen
attention
to
the
replies
the
only
disturbing
factor
being
a
cough
of
wright
which
became
more
and
more
troublesome
as
the
evening
wore
on
by
the
time
uncle
and
nephew
rose
to
depart
the
latter
was
so
hoarse
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
why
did
you
tell
you
had
got
a
letter
calling
you
home
as
i
told
you
he
vociferated
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
shop
i
i
forgot
it
said
the
old
man
forgot
it
repeated
the
incensed
wright
what
did
you
think
i
was
coughing
like
that
for
fun
i
forgot
it
said
the
old
man
doggedly
besides
if
you
take
my
advice
you
better
let
me
stay
a
little
longer
to
make
sure
of
things
wright
laughed
disagreeably
i
dare
say
he
said
but
i
am
managing
this
affair
not
you
now
you
go
round
afternoon
and
tell
them
you
off
d
hear
d
think
i
made
of
money
and
what
do
you
mean
by
making
such
a
fuss
of
that
fool
charlie
hills
you
know
he
is
after
bella
he
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
home
in
indignant
silence
and
after
giving
minute
instructions
to
kemp
next
morning
at
breakfast
went
off
to
work
in
a
more
cheerful
frame
of
mind
kemp
was
out
when
he
returned
and
after
making
his
toilet
he
followed
him
to
bradshaw
to
his
annoyance
he
found
hills
there
again
and
moreover
it
soon
became
clear
to
him
that
kemp
had
said
nothing
about
his
approaching
departure
coughs
and
scowls
passed
unheeded
and
at
last
in
a
hesitating
voice
he
broached
the
subject
himself
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
lamentation
i
had
got
the
heart
to
tell
you
said
kemp
i
do
know
when
i
been
so
happy
but
you
have
got
to
go
back
immediate
said
bradshaw
said
wright
before
the
old
man
could
reply
business
must
you
go
said
bradshaw
kemp
smiled
feebly
i
suppose
i
ought
to
he
replied
in
a
hesitating
voice
take
my
tip
and
give
yourself
a
bit
of
a
holiday
before
you
go
back
urged
hills
just
for
a
few
days
pleaded
bella
to
please
us
said
bradshaw
think
george
miss
you
lay
hold
of
him
and
do
let
him
go
said
hills
he
took
kemp
round
the
waist
and
the
laughing
bella
and
her
mother
each
secured
an
arm
an
appeal
to
wright
to
secure
his
legs
passed
unheeded
we
do
let
you
go
till
you
promise
said
bradshaw
kemp
smiled
and
shook
his
head
promise
said
bella
well
well
said
kemp
he
must
go
back
shouted
the
alarmed
wright
let
him
speak
for
himself
exclaimed
bella
indignantly
just
another
week
then
said
kemp
it
no
good
having
money
if
i
ca
please
myself
a
week
shouted
wright
almost
beside
himself
with
rage
and
dismay
a
week
another
week
why
you
told
me
oh
do
listen
to
him
said
bradshaw
croaker
it
his
own
business
ai
it
and
he
knows
best
do
he
what
it
got
to
do
with
you
she
patted
kemp
hand
kemp
patted
back
and
with
his
disengaged
hand
helped
himself
to
a
glass
of
beer
the
fourth
and
beamed
in
a
friendly
fashion
upon
the
company
george
he
said
suddenly
yes
said
wright
in
a
harsh
voice
did
you
think
to
bring
my
along
with
you
no
said
wright
sharply
i
did
said
the
old
man
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance
well
lend
me
a
couple
of
pounds
then
or
else
run
back
and
fetch
my
he
added
with
a
sly
grin
wright
face
worked
with
impotent
fury
what
what
do
you
want
it
for
he
gasped
bradshaw
well
well
seemed
to
sum
up
the
general
feeling
kemp
shaking
his
head
eyed
him
with
gentle
reproach
me
and
bradshaw
are
going
to
gave
another
evening
out
he
said
quietly
i
only
got
a
few
more
days
and
i
must
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
to
wright
the
room
seemed
to
revolve
slowly
on
its
axis
but
regaining
his
by
a
supreme
effort
he
took
out
his
purse
and
produced
the
amount
bradshaw
after
a
few
feminine
protestations
went
upstairs
to
put
her
bonnet
on
and
you
can
go
and
fetch
a
george
while
she
of
it
said
kemp
pick
out
a
good
if
you
can
wright
arose
and
departing
with
a
suddenness
that
was
almost
startling
exploded
harmlessly
in
front
of
the
barber
next
door
but
one
then
with
lagging
steps
he
went
in
search
of
the
shabbiest
cab
and
oldest
horse
he
could
find
thankee
my
boy
said
kemp
bluffly
as
he
helped
bradshaw
in
and
stood
with
his
foot
on
the
step
by
the
way
you
had
better
go
back
and
lock
my
up
i
left
it
on
the
washstand
and
there
best
part
of
a
thousand
pounds
in
it
you
can
take
fifty
for
yourself
to
buy
smokes
with
there
was
a
murmur
of
admiration
and
wright
with
a
frantic
attempt
to
keep
up
appearances
tried
to
thank
him
but
in
vain
long
after
the
cab
had
rolled
away
he
stood
on
the
pavement
trying
to
think
out
a
position
which
was
rapidly
becoming
unendurable
still
keeping
up
appearances
he
had
to
pretend
to
go
home
to
look
after
the
leaving
the
jubilant
hills
to
improve
the
shining
hour
with
miss
bradshaw
kemp
returning
home
at
midnight
in
a
cab
found
the
young
man
waiting
up
for
him
and
taking
a
seat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
listened
unmoved
to
a
of
himself
which
seemed
interminable
he
was
only
moved
to
speech
when
wright
described
him
as
a
jezebel
who
was
a
disgrace
to
his
sex
and
then
merely
in
the
interests
of
natural
science
do
you
worry
he
said
as
the
other
paused
from
exhaustion
it
wo
be
for
long
now
long
said
wright
panting
first
thing
morning
you
have
a
telegram
calling
you
back
a
telegram
that
must
be
minded
d
see
no
i
do
said
kemp
plainly
i
not
going
back
never
no
more
never
i
going
to
stop
here
and
court
mrs
bradshaw
wright
fought
for
breath
you
you
ca
he
gasped
i
going
to
have
a
try
said
the
old
man
i
sick
of
going
to
sea
and
it
be
a
nice
comfortable
home
for
my
old
age
you
marry
bella
and
i
marry
her
mother
happy
family
wright
trembling
with
rage
sat
down
to
recover
and
regaining
his
composure
after
a
time
pointed
out
almost
calmly
the
various
difficulties
in
the
way
i
thought
it
all
out
said
kemp
nodding
she
must
know
not
rich
till
after
we
married
then
i
a
letter
from
new
zealand
saying
i
lost
all
my
money
it
just
as
easy
to
have
that
letter
as
the
one
you
spoke
of
and
i
to
find
you
money
to
play
the
rich
uncle
with
till
married
i
suppose
said
wright
in
a
grating
voice
and
then
lose
bella
when
bradshaw
finds
you
lost
your
money
kemp
scratched
his
ear
that
your
lookout
he
said
at
last
now
look
here
said
wright
with
great
determination
either
you
go
and
tell
them
that
you
been
telegraphed
for
cabled
is
the
proper
word
or
i
tell
them
the
truth
that
settle
you
then
said
kemp
no
more
than
the
other
would
retorted
the
young
man
and
it
come
cheaper
one
thing
i
take
my
oath
of
and
that
is
i
wo
give
you
another
farthing
but
if
you
do
as
i
tell
you
i
give
you
a
quid
for
luck
now
think
it
over
kemp
thought
it
over
and
after
a
vain
attempt
to
raise
the
promised
reward
to
five
pounds
finally
compounded
for
two
and
went
off
to
bed
after
a
few
stormy
words
on
selfishness
and
ingratitude
he
declined
to
speak
to
his
host
at
breakfast
next
morning
and
accompanied
him
in
the
evening
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
going
to
the
stake
he
listened
in
stony
silence
to
the
young
man
instructions
and
only
spoke
when
the
latter
refused
to
pay
the
two
pounds
in
advance
the
news
communicated
in
halting
accents
by
kemp
was
received
with
flattering
dismay
bradshaw
refused
to
believe
her
ears
and
it
was
only
after
the
information
had
been
repeated
and
confirmed
by
wright
that
she
understood
i
must
go
said
kemp
i
spent
over
eleven
pounds
cabling
but
it
all
no
good
but
you
coming
back
said
hills
o
course
i
am
was
the
reply
george
is
the
only
relation
i
got
and
i
got
to
look
after
him
i
suppose
after
all
blood
is
thicker
than
water
hear
hear
said
bradshaw
piously
and
there
you
and
bella
continued
kemp
two
of
the
best
that
ever
breathed
the
ladies
looked
down
and
charlie
hills
i
do
know
i
do
know
i
when
i
took
such
a
fancy
to
anybody
as
i
have
to
if
i
was
a
young
gal
a
single
young
gal
he
the
other
half
he
said
slowly
as
he
paused
just
the
one
i
should
fancy
he
a
draw
it
mild
interrupted
the
blushing
hills
as
wright
bestowed
a
ferocious
glance
upon
the
speaker
clever
lively
young
fellow
concluded
kemp
george
yes
said
wright
i
going
now
i
got
to
catch
the
train
for
southampton
but
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
i
prefer
to
be
alone
you
stay
here
and
cheer
them
up
oh
and
before
i
forget
it
lend
me
a
couple
o
pounds
out
that
fifty
i
gave
you
last
night
i
given
all
my
small
change
away
he
looked
up
and
met
wright
eye
the
latter
too
affected
to
speak
took
out
the
money
and
passed
it
over
we
never
know
what
may
happen
to
us
said
the
old
man
solemnly
as
he
rose
and
buttoned
his
coat
i
an
old
man
and
i
like
to
have
things
i
spent
nearly
the
whole
day
with
my
lawyer
and
if
anything
to
my
old
carcass
it
wo
make
any
difference
i
have
left
half
my
money
to
george
half
of
all
i
have
is
to
be
his
in
the
midst
of
an
awed
silence
he
went
round
and
shook
hands
the
other
half
with
his
hand
on
the
door
the
other
half
and
my
best
gold
watch
and
chain
i
have
left
to
my
dear
young
pal
charlie
hills
georgie
