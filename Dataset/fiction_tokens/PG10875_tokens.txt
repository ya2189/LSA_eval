gossip
from
one
or
two
quarters
which
reached
captain
nugent
ears
through
the
medium
of
his
sister
concerning
the
preparations
for
his
son
marriage
prevented
him
from
altering
his
mind
with
regard
to
the
visits
of
jem
hardy
and
showing
that
painstaking
young
man
the
door
indeed
the
nearness
of
the
approaching
nuptials
bade
fair
to
eclipse
for
the
time
being
all
other
grievances
and
when
hardy
paid
his
third
visit
he
made
a
determined
but
ineffectual
attempt
to
obtain
from
him
some
information
as
to
the
methods
by
which
he
hoped
to
attain
his
ends
his
failure
made
him
suspicious
and
he
hinted
pretty
plainly
that
he
had
no
guarantee
that
his
visitor
was
not
obtaining
admittance
under
false
pretences
well
i
not
getting
much
out
of
it
returned
hardy
frankly
i
wonder
you
come
said
his
hospitable
host
i
want
you
to
get
used
to
me
said
the
other
the
captain
started
and
eyed
him
uneasily
the
remark
seemed
fraught
with
hidden
meaning
and
then
he
inquired
raising
his
bushy
eyebrows
then
perhaps
i
can
come
oftener
the
captain
gave
him
up
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
crossing
his
legs
smoked
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
it
was
difficult
to
know
what
to
do
with
a
young
man
who
was
apparently
destitute
of
any
feelings
of
shame
or
embarrassment
he
bestowed
a
puzzled
glance
in
his
direction
and
saw
that
he
was
lolling
in
the
chair
with
an
appearance
of
the
greatest
ease
and
enjoyment
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
he
saw
that
he
was
gazing
with
much
satisfaction
at
a
photograph
of
miss
nugent
which
graced
the
mantelpiece
with
an
odd
sensation
the
captain
suddenly
identified
it
as
one
which
usually
stood
on
the
chest
of
drawers
in
his
bedroom
and
he
wondered
darkly
whether
charity
or
mischief
was
responsible
for
its
appearance
there
in
any
case
it
disappeared
before
the
occasion
of
hardy
next
visit
and
the
visitor
sat
with
his
eyes
unoccupied
endeavouring
to
make
conversation
with
a
host
who
was
if
anything
more
discourteous
than
usual
it
was
uphill
work
but
he
persevered
and
in
fifteen
minutes
had
ranged
unchecked
from
north
pole
explorations
to
poultry
farming
it
was
a
relief
to
both
of
them
when
the
door
opened
and
bella
ushered
in
murchison
the
captain
received
the
new
arrival
with
marked
cordiality
and
giving
him
a
chair
near
his
own
observed
with
some
interest
the
curt
greeting
of
the
young
men
the
doctor
manner
indicated
polite
surprise
at
seeing
the
other
there
then
he
turned
to
the
captain
and
began
to
talk
to
him
for
some
time
they
chatted
without
interruption
and
the
replies
when
hardy
at
last
made
an
attempt
to
make
the
conversation
general
enabled
the
doctor
to
see
without
much
difficulty
that
the
latter
was
an
unwelcome
guest
charmed
with
the
discovery
he
followed
his
host
lead
and
with
a
languid
air
replied
to
his
rival
in
monosyllables
the
captain
watched
with
quiet
satisfaction
and
at
each
rebuff
his
opinion
of
murchison
improved
it
was
gratifying
to
find
that
the
interloper
had
met
his
match
hardy
sat
patient
i
am
glad
to
have
met
you
he
said
after
a
long
pause
during
which
the
other
two
were
discussing
a
former
surgical
experience
of
the
captain
on
one
of
his
crew
yes
said
murchison
you
are
just
the
man
i
wanted
to
see
yes
said
the
doctor
again
yes
said
the
other
nodding
i
been
very
busy
of
late
owing
to
my
partner
illness
and
you
are
attending
several
people
i
want
to
hear
about
indeed
said
murchison
with
a
towards
him
how
is
mrs
paul
inquired
hardy
dead
replied
the
other
briefly
dead
repeated
hardy
good
heavens
i
did
know
that
there
was
much
the
matter
with
her
there
was
no
hope
for
her
from
the
first
said
murchison
somewhat
sharply
it
was
merely
a
question
of
prolonging
her
life
a
little
while
she
lived
longer
than
i
deemed
possible
she
surprised
everybody
by
her
vitality
poor
thing
said
hardy
how
is
joe
banks
dead
said
murchison
again
biting
his
lip
and
eyeing
him
furiously
dear
me
said
hardy
shaking
his
head
i
met
him
not
a
month
ago
he
was
on
his
way
to
see
you
then
the
poor
fellow
had
been
an
invalid
nearly
all
his
life
said
murchison
to
the
captain
casually
aye
i
remember
him
was
the
reply
i
am
almost
afraid
to
ask
you
continued
hardy
but
shut
up
all
day
i
hear
so
little
how
is
old
miss
ritherdon
murchison
reddened
with
helpless
rage
captain
nugent
gazing
at
the
questioner
with
something
almost
approaching
respect
waited
breathlessly
for
the
invariable
answer
she
died
three
weeks
ago
i
surprised
that
you
have
not
heard
of
it
said
the
doctor
pointedly
of
course
she
was
old
said
hardy
with
the
air
of
one
advancing
extenuating
circumstances
very
old
replied
the
doctor
who
knew
that
the
other
was
now
at
the
end
of
his
obituary
list
are
there
any
other
of
my
patients
you
are
anxious
to
hear
about
illustration
are
there
any
other
of
my
patients
you
are
anxious
to
hear
about
no
thank
you
returned
hardy
with
some
haste
the
doctor
turned
to
his
host
again
but
the
charm
was
broken
his
talk
was
disconnected
owing
probably
to
the
fact
that
he
was
racking
his
brain
for
facts
relative
to
the
seamy
side
of
shipbroking
and
hardy
without
any
encouragement
whatever
was
interrupting
with
puerile
anecdotes
concerning
the
late
lamented
joe
banks
the
captain
came
to
the
rescue
the
ladies
are
in
the
garden
he
said
to
the
doctor
perhaps
like
to
join
them
he
looked
coldly
over
at
hardy
as
he
spoke
to
see
the
effect
of
his
words
their
eyes
met
and
the
young
man
was
on
his
feet
as
soon
as
his
rival
thanks
he
said
coolly
it
is
a
trifle
close
indoors
before
the
dismayed
captain
could
think
of
any
dignified
pretext
to
stay
him
he
was
out
of
the
room
the
doctor
followed
and
the
perturbed
captain
left
alone
stared
blankly
at
the
door
and
thought
of
his
daughter
words
concerning
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
he
was
a
proud
man
and
loth
to
show
discomfiture
so
that
it
was
not
until
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
that
he
followed
his
guests
to
the
garden
the
four
people
were
in
couples
the
paths
favouring
that
formation
although
the
doctor
to
the
detriment
of
the
border
had
made
two
or
three
determined
attempts
to
march
in
fours
with
a
feeling
akin
to
scorn
the
captain
saw
that
he
was
walking
with
kingdom
while
some
distance
in
the
rear
jem
hardy
followed
with
kate
he
stood
at
the
back
door
for
a
little
while
watching
hardy
upright
and
elate
was
listening
with
profound
attention
to
miss
nugent
the
doctor
sauntering
along
beside
kingdom
was
listening
with
a
languid
air
to
an
account
of
her
celebrated
escape
from
measles
some
years
before
as
a
professional
man
he
would
have
died
rather
than
have
owed
his
life
to
the
specific
she
advocated
kate
nugent
catching
sight
of
her
father
turned
and
as
he
came
slowly
towards
them
linked
her
arm
in
his
her
face
was
slightly
flushed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
i
was
just
coming
in
to
fetch
you
she
observed
it
is
so
pleasant
out
here
now
delightful
said
hardy
we
had
to
drop
behind
a
little
said
miss
nugent
raising
her
voice
aunt
and
murchison
talk
about
their
complaints
to
each
other
they
have
been
exchanging
prescriptions
the
captain
grunted
and
eyed
her
keenly
i
want
you
to
come
in
and
give
us
a
little
music
he
said
shortly
kate
nodded
what
is
your
favourite
music
mr
hardy
she
inquired
with
a
smile
unfortunately
hardy
ca
stay
said
the
captain
in
a
voice
which
there
was
no
mistaking
hardy
pulled
out
his
watch
no
i
must
be
off
he
said
with
a
start
thank
you
for
reminding
me
captain
nugent
i
am
glad
to
have
been
of
service
said
the
other
looking
his
grimmest
he
acknowledged
the
young
man
farewell
with
a
short
nod
and
forgetting
his
sudden
desire
for
music
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
with
his
daughter
what
have
you
been
saying
to
that
that
fellow
he
demanded
turning
to
her
suddenly
miss
nugent
reflected
i
said
it
was
a
fine
evening
she
replied
at
last
no
doubt
said
her
father
what
else
i
think
i
asked
him
whether
he
was
fond
of
gardening
said
miss
nugent
slowly
yes
i
sure
i
did
you
had
no
business
to
speak
to
him
at
all
said
the
fuming
captain
i
do
quite
see
how
i
could
help
doing
so
said
his
daughter
you
surely
do
expect
me
to
be
rude
to
your
visitors
besides
i
feel
rather
sorry
for
him
sorry
repeated
the
captain
sharply
what
for
because
he
has
got
a
nice
kind
father
said
miss
nugent
squeezing
his
arm
affectionately
the
appearance
of
the
other
couple
at
the
head
of
the
path
saved
the
captain
the
necessity
of
a
retort
they
stood
in
a
little
knot
talking
but
miss
nugent
contrary
to
her
usual
habit
said
but
little
she
was
holding
her
father
arm
and
gazing
absently
at
the
dim
fields
stretching
away
beyond
the
garden
at
the
same
time
james
hardy
feeling
despite
his
bold
front
somewhat
badly
snubbed
was
sitting
on
the
beach
thinking
over
the
situation
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
company
of
kate
nugent
all
else
seemed
sordid
and
prosaic
his
own
conduct
in
his
attempt
to
save
her
brother
from
the
consequences
of
his
folly
most
sordid
of
all
he
wondered
gloomily
what
she
would
think
when
she
heard
of
it
illustration
he
wondered
gloomily
what
she
would
think
when
she
heard
of
it
he
rose
at
last
and
in
the
pale
light
of
the
new
moon
walked
slowly
along
towards
the
town
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
wanted
to
talk
about
kate
nugent
and
the
only
person
who
could
be
depended
upon
for
doing
that
was
samson
wilks
it
was
a
subject
of
the
steward
and
since
his
discovery
of
the
state
of
hardy
feelings
in
that
quarter
the
slightest
allusion
was
sufficient
to
let
loose
a
flood
of
reminiscences
it
was
dark
by
the
time
hardy
reached
the
alley
and
in
most
of
the
houses
the
lamps
were
lit
behind
drawn
blinds
the
steward
house
however
was
in
darkness
and
there
was
no
response
when
he
tapped
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
looked
in
a
dim
figure
rose
with
a
start
from
a
chair
i
hope
you
were
not
asleep
said
hardy
no
sir
said
the
steward
in
a
relieved
voice
i
thought
it
was
somebody
else
he
placed
a
chair
for
his
visitor
and
having
lit
the
lamp
slowly
lowered
the
blind
and
took
a
seat
opposite
i
been
sitting
in
the
dark
to
make
a
certain
party
think
i
was
out
he
said
slowly
she
keeps
making
a
excuse
about
teddy
to
come
over
and
see
me
last
night
talked
about
making
a
in
the
water
to
celebrate
kybird
wedding
and
she
came
over
and
sat
in
that
chair
and
cried
as
if
would
break
after
she
gone
teddy
comes
over
fierce
as
a
eagle
and
wants
to
know
wot
i
been
saying
to
mother
to
make
cry
between
the
two
of
i
a
nice
life
of
it
he
is
still
faithful
to
miss
kybird
then
said
hardy
with
a
sudden
sense
of
relief
faithful
said
wilks
faithful
ai
no
word
for
it
he
a
sticker
that
wot
is
and
it
my
misfortune
that
mother
takes
after
i
to
go
out
afore
breakfast
and
stay
out
till
late
at
night
and
even
then
like
as
not
she
catches
me
on
the
doorstep
well
perhaps
she
will
make
a
hole
in
the
water
suggested
hardy
wilks
smiled
but
almost
instantly
became
grave
again
she
not
that
sort
he
said
bitterly
and
went
into
the
kitchen
to
draw
some
beer
he
drank
his
in
a
manner
which
betokened
that
the
occupation
afforded
him
no
enjoyment
and
full
of
his
own
troubles
was
in
no
mood
to
discuss
anything
else
he
gave
a
short
biography
of
mrs
silk
which
would
have
furnished
abundant
material
for
libel
actions
and
alluding
to
the
demise
of
the
late
mr
silk
spoke
of
it
as
though
it
were
the
supreme
act
of
artfulness
in
a
somewhat
adventurous
career
hardy
walked
home
with
a
mind
more
at
ease
than
it
had
been
at
any
time
since
his
overtures
to
swann
the
only
scruple
that
had
troubled
him
was
now
removed
and
in
place
of
it
he
felt
that
he
was
acting
the
part
of
a
guardian
angel
to
edward
silk
chapter
xxii
nathan
smith
usually
one
of
the
most
men
in
the
world
came
out
of
swann
house
in
a
condition
and
for
some
time
after
the
front
door
had
closed
behind
him
stood
gaping
on
the
narrow
pavement
he
looked
up
and
down
the
quiet
little
street
and
shook
his
head
sadly
it
was
a
street
of
staid
and
substantial
old
houses
houses
which
had
mellowed
and
blackened
with
age
but
whose
quaint
windows
and
doors
afforded
glimpses
of
comfort
attesting
to
the
prosperity
of
those
within
in
the
usual
way
nathan
smith
was
of
too
philosophical
a
temperament
to
experience
the
pangs
of
envy
but
these
things
affected
him
and
he
experienced
a
strange
feeling
of
discontent
with
his
lot
in
life
some
people
all
the
luck
he
muttered
and
walked
slowly
down
the
road
illustration
people
all
the
luck
he
muttered
he
continued
his
reflections
as
he
walked
through
the
somewhat
squalid
streets
of
his
own
quarter
the
afternoon
was
wet
and
the
houses
looked
dingier
than
usual
dirty
inconvenient
little
places
most
of
them
with
a
few
cheap
gimcracks
making
a
brave
show
as
near
the
window
as
possible
smith
observed
them
with
newly
opened
eyes
and
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
life
thought
of
the
and
struggles
of
the
poor
in
his
own
untidy
little
den
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
sat
for
some
time
deep
in
thought
over
the
events
of
the
afternoon
he
had
been
permitted
a
peep
at
wealth
at
wealth
too
which
was
changing
hands
but
was
not
coming
his
way
he
lit
his
pipe
and
producing
a
bottle
of
rum
from
a
cupboard
helped
himself
liberally
the
potent
fluid
softened
him
somewhat
and
a
intention
to
keep
the
news
from
kybird
melted
away
beneath
its
benign
influence
after
all
we
been
pals
for
pretty
near
thirty
years
said
smith
to
himself
he
took
another
draught
thirty
years
is
a
long
time
he
mused
he
finished
the
glass
and
if
do
give
me
something
out
of
it
do
as
much
as
i
can
he
continued
and
buttoning
up
his
coat
he
rose
and
set
out
in
the
direction
of
the
high
street
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
sun
was
making
faint
efforts
to
break
through
watery
clouds
things
seemed
brighter
and
smith
heart
beat
in
response
he
was
going
to
play
the
part
of
a
benefactor
to
kybird
to
offer
him
access
at
any
rate
to
such
wealth
as
he
had
never
dreamed
of
he
paused
at
the
shop
window
and
observing
through
a
gap
in
the
merchandise
that
kybird
was
the
counter
walked
in
and
saluted
him
i
got
news
for
you
he
said
slowly
big
news
oh
said
kybird
with
indifference
big
news
repeated
smith
sinking
thoughtlessly
into
the
broken
and
slowly
extricating
himself
something
that
make
your
eyes
start
out
of
your
the
small
black
eyes
in
question
were
turned
shrewdly
in
his
direction
i
news
of
you
afore
nat
remarked
kybird
with
simple
severity
the
philanthropist
was
chilled
he
fixed
his
eyes
in
a
stony
stare
on
the
opposite
wall
kybird
who
had
ever
a
wholesome
dread
of
falling
a
victim
to
his
friend
cuteness
regarded
him
with
some
uncertainty
and
reminded
him
of
one
or
two
pieces
of
information
which
had
seriously
depleted
his
till
banns
up
yet

gazing
in

of
him
with
fathomless
eyes

kybird

his
friend
with

emphasis

heat

mildly

for
the
best

i
better
my
tongue

than

it
ai
my
bisness

i
should

of

inquired
kybird
uneasily
smith
still
gazing
musingly
before
him
appeared
not
to
hear
the
question
nice
after
the
rain
ai
it
he
said
slowly
it
all
right
said
the
other
shortly
everything
smells
so
fresh
and
sweet
continued
his
friend
all
the
little
was
as
if
their
little
would
break
as
i
come
along
i
do
wonder
at
it
said
the
offended
kybird
and
the

murmured
the
to
himself
well

demanded
kybird
not
replied
the
other
do
blame
me
when
it
too
late
that
all
kybird
staring
at
him
wrathfully
turned
this
dark
saying
over
in
his
mind
too
late
for
wot
he
inquired
ah
said
nathan
smith
slowly
nice
and
fresh
after
the
rain
it
as
i
come
along
all
the
little
drat
the
little
interrupted
kybird
with
sudden
violence
if
you
got
anything
to
say
why
do
you
say
it
like
a
man
illustration
if
you
got
anything
to
say
why
do
you
say
it
like
a
man
the
parlour
door
opened
suddenly
before
the
other
could
reply
and
revealed
the
face
of
kybird
wot
are
you
two
about
she
demanded
why
do
you
come
inside
and
sit
down
for
a
bit
smith
accepted
the
invitation
and
following
her
into
the
room
found
miss
kybird
busy
stitching
in
the
midst
of
a
bewildering
assortment
of
brown
paper
patterns
and
pieces
of
cloth
kybird
gave
him
a
chair
and
having
overheard
a
portion
of
his
conversation
with
her
husband
made
one
or
two
casual
inquiries
i
been
spending
a
hour
or
two
at
swann
said
smith
and
is
inquired
his
hostess
with
an
appearance
of
amiable
interest
the
shook
his
head
slipping
cable
he
said
slowly
been
making
will
and
i
was
one
o
the
witnesses
something
in
smith
manner
as
he
uttered
this
simple
statement
made
his
listeners
anxious
to
hear
more
kybird
who
had
just
entered
the
room
and
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
door
holding
the
handle
regarded
him
expectantly
it
been
worrying
some
time
pursued
smith
got
nobody
belonging
to
and
for
a
long
time
could
think
to
leave
it
wot

property
and
other
things
it
a
matter
of
over
ten
thousand
pounds
good
said
kybird
who
felt
that
he
was
expected
to
say
something
blaikie
was
the
other
witness
continued
smith
disregarding
the
interruption
and
swann
made
us
both
promise
to
keep
it
a
dead
secret
till
gone
but
out
o
friendship
to
you
i
thought
i
step
round
and
let
you
know
the
emphasis
on
the
words
was
unmistakable
kybird
dropped
her
work
and
sat
staring
at
him
while
her
husband
wriggled
with
excitement
ai
left
it
to
me
i
he
said
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
jocularity
not
a
brass
farden
replied
his
friend
cheerfully
not
to
none
of
you
why
should
he
ai
left
it
to
jack

said
miss
kybird
who
had
suspended
her
work
to
listen

my
dear
replied
the
e
made
will
all
and
proper
and
left
everything
all
that
property
and
other
things
amounting
to
over
ten
thousand
pounds
to
a
young
man
becos
was
jilt
crossed
in
love
a
few
months
ago
and
becos

a
good
and
faithful
servant

kybird

i
wo

said
the
accommodating
smith
but
mind
it
a
dead
secret
kybird
wiped
his
brow
and
red
patches
due
to
excitement
lent
a
little
variety
to
an
otherwise
commonplace
face
kybird
dazed
inquiry
wot
are
we
to
fell
on
deaf
ears
while
miss
kybird
leaning
forward
with
lips
parted
fixed
her
eyes
intently
on
face
it
a
pity
did
leave
it
to
young
nugent

thrust
his
handkerchief
into
his
and
all
the
father
awoke
within
him

said
with
fierce
sarcasm

kybird
nodding

himself
up
into
a
fury

out
with
my
gal
for
months
and
months

kybird
addressing

visitor

her
husband

and
never

explanation
from

not

kybird
i

kybird
with
decision

nathan
smith
shortly
sense
cried
kybird
is
my
gal
to
be
played
fast
and
loose
with
like
that
is
my
gal
to
be
pitched
over
when
likes
is
my
gal
wot
the
good
o
talking
like
that
to
me
said
the
indignant
smith
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
get
married
to
teddy
at
once
afore
knows
of
luck
and
when
that
be
inquired
his
friend
in
a
calmer
voice
any
time
said
the
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
old
gentleman
might
go
out
or
again
might
live
on
for
a
week
or
more
was
so
weak
could
sign
name
i
signed
it
all
right
said
kybird
starting
safe
as
said
his
friend
well
why
not
wait
till
teddy
got
the
money
suggested
kybird
with
a
knowing
shake
of
her
head
becos
said
smith
in
a
grating
voice
for
one
thing
be
a
rich
man
then
and
could
pick
teddy
silk
on
a
pound
or
thereabouts
a
week
and
teddy
silk
with
ten
thousand
pounds
be
two
different
people
besides
that
think
she
was
marrying
for
money
if
thought
that
said
kybird
firmly
i
never
forgive
my
advice
to
you
said
nathan
smith
shaking
his
forefinger
impressively
is
to
get
married
on
the
quiet
and
as
soon
as
possible
once
they
tied
up
teddy
ca
why
on
the
quiet
demanded
kybird
sharply
the
uttered
an
impatient
exclamation
becos
if
swann
got
to
of
it
he
guess
i
been
blabbing
for
one
thing
he
said
sharply
and
for
another
left
it
to
partly
to
make
up
for
disappointment
he
been
disappointed
in
younger
days
so
told
me
suppose
managed
to
get
enough
strength
to
alter
will
kybird
shivered
it
takes
time
to
get
married
though
he
objected
yes
said
smith
ironically
it
does
get
round
young
teddy
and
then
put
the
banns
up
take
your
time
about
it
and
be
sure
and
let
swann
know
d
think
would
understand
wot
it
meant
and
spoil
it
to
say
nothing
of
teddy
seeing
through
it
well
wot
to
be
done
then
inquired
the
staring
kybird
send
up
to
london
and
married
by
special
license
said
smith
speaking
rapidly
if
possible
if
not
the
day
after
go
and
pitch
a
tale
to
teddy
and
make
understand
it
to
be
done
on
the
strict
special
licenses
cost
money
said
kybird
i
it
a
matter
o
thirty
pounds
or
thereabouts
nathan
smith
rose
and
his
eyes
were
almost
expressive
he
nodded
to
the
ladies
and
crossed
to
the
door
kybird
suddenly
seized
him
by
the
coat
and
held
him
illustration
kybird
suddenly
seized
him
by
the
coat
do
be
in
a
nat
she
pleaded
we
ai
all
as
clever
as
you
are
talk
about
looking
a
in
the
mouth
began
the
indignant
smith
sit
down
urged
kybird
you
ca
expect
us
to
be
as
quick
in
seeing
things
as
wot
you
are
he
pushed
his
partly
mollified
friend
into
his
chair
again
and
taking
a
seat
next
him
began
to
view
the
affair
with
enthusiasm
shall
turn
young
nugent
off
he
said
firmly
that
right
said
the
other
go
and
do
a
few
more
silly
things
like
that
and
we
shall
be
if
you
got
a
instead
of
wot
you
got
you
would
talk
of
giving
the
show
away
like
that
nobody
must
know
or
guess
about
anything
until
young
teddy
is
married
to
and
got
the
money
it
seems
something
like
deceitfulness
said
miss
kybird
who
had
been
listening
to
the
plans
for
her
future
with
admirable
composure
it
for
teddy
own
sake
said
nathan
smith
everybody
knows
half
crazy
after
you
i
do
know
that
i
do
like
best
even
without
the
money
said
miss
kybird
calmly
nobody
could
been
more
attentive
than
i
believe
that
marry
me
if
a
hundred
thousand
but
it
looks
better
your
way
better
all
round
said
nathan
smith
with
at
approving
nod
now
round
to
teddy
and
whistle
back
and
mind
to
keep
it
a
dead
secret
on
account
o
trouble
with
young
nugent
d
twig
the
admiring
kybird
said
that
he
was
a
wonder
and
in
the
discussion
on
ways
and
means
which
followed
sat
listening
with
growing
respect
to
the
managing
abilities
both
of
his
friend
and
his
wife
difficulties
were
only
mentioned
for
the
purpose
of
being
satisfactorily
solved
and
he
noticed
with
keen
appreciation
that
the
prospect
of
a
ten
thousand
pound
was
already
adding
to
that
lady
dignity
she
sniffed
haughtily
as
she
spoke
of
that
nugent
lot
and
the
manner
in
which
she
promised
smith
that
he
should
not
lose
by
his
services
would
have
graced
a
duchess
i
did
expect
to
lose
by
it
said

pointedly

the
chequers

then

chapter
xxiii
the
summer
evening
was
well
advanced
when
kybird
and
his
old
friend
parted
the
former
gentleman
was
in
almost
a
sentimental
mood
and
the
satisfied
that
his
pupil
was
in
a
particularly
appropriate
frame
of
mind
for
the
object
of
his
visit
renewed
his
instructions
about
binding
mr
silk
to
secrecy
and
departed
on
business
of
his
own
illustration
kybird
and
his
old
friend
parted
kybird
walked
slowly
towards
fullalove
alley
with
his
head
sunk
in
meditation
he
was
anxious
to
find
mr
silk
alone
as
otherwise
the
difficulty
of
his
errand
would
be
considerably
increased
mrs
intelligence
being
by
no
means
obscured
by
any
ungovernable
affection
for
the
kybird
family
if
she
was
at
home
she
would
have
to
invent
some
pretext
for
luring
teddy
into
the
privacy
of
the
open
air
the
lamp
was
lit
in
the
front
room
by
the
time
he
reached
the
house
and
the
shadows
of
geraniums
which
had
won
through
several
winters
formed
a
straggling
pattern
on
the
holland
blind
kybird
first
making
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
peep
round
the
edges
of
this
decoration
tapped
gently
on
the
door
and
in
response
to
a
command
to
come
in
turned
the
handle
and
looked
into
the
room
to
his
relief
he
saw
that
mr
silk
was
alone
good
evening
teddy
he
said
with
a
genial
smile
as
he
entered
slowly
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
i
i
see
you
well
i
quite
well
returned
mr
silk
gazing
at
him
with
unconcealed
surprise
i
glad
to
it
said
kybird
in
a
somewhat
reproachful
voice
for
your
sake
for
sake
though
i
did
expect
to
find
you
looking
a
little
bit
down
ah
it
the
wimmen
that
the
after
all
mr
silk
coughed
what
d
mean
he
inquired
somewhat
puzzled
i
came
to
see
you
teddy
on
a
very
delikit
business
said
kybird
taking
a
seat
and
gazing
diffidently
at
his
hat
as
he
swung
it
between
his
hands
though
as
man
to
man
i
doing
of
my
dooty
but
if
you
do
want
to
wot
i
got
to
say
say
so
and
darken
your
door
no
more
how
can
i
know
whether
i
want
to
it
or
not
when
i
do
know
wot
it
is
said
mr
silk
judiciously
kybird
sat
biting
his
then
he
looked
up
suddenly
he
said
with
an
outburst
of
desperate
frankness
is
crying
eyes
out
mr
silk
with
a
smothered
exclamation
started
up
from
his
chair
and
regarded
him
eagerly
if
she
knew
i
been
pursued
kybird
she
i
do
know
wot
she
would
do
that
pride
but
i
got
my
pride
too
the
pride
of
a
father
what
what
she
crying
about
inquired
mr
silk
in
an
unsteady
voice
she
been
looking
poorly
for
some
time
continued
the
veracious
kybird
and
crying
when
i
tell
you
that
part
o
the
wot
she
was
making
to
be
taken
away
from
because
o
the
tears
she
dropped
on
it
you
may
some
idea
of
wot
things
are
like
never
forgot
you
teddy
and
it
was
your
quick
temper
that
day
that
made
take
on
with
young
nugent
she
got
a
temper
too
but
she
give
love
once
and
being
my
daughter
she
could
give
it
agin
he
stole
a
glance
at
his
listener
mr
silk
very
pale
and
upright
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
shaking
all
over
with
nervous
excitement
twice
he
tried
to
speak
and
failed
that
it
is
teddy
sighed
kybird
rising
as
though
to
depart
i
done
my
dooty
it
was
a
thing
to
do
but
i
done
it
do
you
mean
said
mr
silk
recovering
his
voice
at
last
do
you
mean
that
amelia
would
marry
me
after
all
do
i
mean
repeated
kybird
naturally
indignant
that
his
very
plain
speaking
should
be
deemed
capable
of
any
misconstruction
am
i
speaking
to
a
stock
or
a
stone
teddy
mr
silk
took
a
deep
breath
and
buttoned
up
his
coat
as
though
preparing
to
meet
nugent
there
and
then
in
deadly
encounter
for
the
person
of
miss
kybird
the
colour
was
back
in
his
cheeks
by
this
time
and
his
eyes
were
unusually
bright
he
took
a
step
towards
kybird
and
pressing
his
hand
warmly
pushed
him
back
into
his
seat
again
there
pride
to
consider
teddy
said
the
latter
gentleman
with
the
whisper
of
a
conspirator
she
ca
stand
being
talked
about
all
over
the
town
and
pointed
at

me
see
anybody

said
the
truculent
mr
silk
let
me
see
that

that

way
to
talk

said
kybird
gazing
at
him
with
admiration
talk
said
the
heroic
mr
silk
i
do
more
than
talk
he
clenched
his
fists
and
paced
boldly
up
and
down
the
hearthrug
you
leave
things
to
me
said
kybird
with
a
confidential
wink
i
see
that
it
all
right
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
keep
it
a
dead
secret

your
mother
must
know

as
secret
as
the
grave
said
the
overjoyed
mr
silk
there
lots
o

be
taken
into
consideration

kybird
truthfully
it
might
be
as
well
for

said
the
astonished
mr
silk
she
got
the
nerve
to
send
young
nugent
about

kybird

gloomily
and
he
flushed
crimson
as
the
possibilities
suggested
by
the
remark
occurred
to
him
i
been
thinking
it
over
for
some
time
resumed
kybird
twisting
it
and
turning
it
all
ways
and
the
only
thing
i
can
see
for
it
is
for
you
to
be
married
on
the
strict
of
course
if
you
do
like
like
repeated
the
transported
mr
silk
i
go
and
be
married
now
if
you
like
kybird
shook
his
head
at
such
haste
and
then
softening
a
little
observed
that
it
did
him
credit
he
proceeded
to
improve
the
occasion
by
anecdotes
of
his
own
courting
some
thirty
years
before
and
was
in
the
middle
of
a
thrilling
account
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
bearded
the
whose
of
his
future
wife
family
when
a
quick
step
outside
which
paused
at
the
door
brought
him
to
a
sudden
halt
mother
announced
mr
silk
in
a
whisper
kybird
nodded
and
the
heroic
appearance
of
visage
which
had
accompanied
his
tale
gave
way
to
an
expression
of
some
uneasiness
he
coughed
behind
his
hand
and
sat
gazing
before
him
as
mrs
silk
entered
the
room
and
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
as
she
saw
the
visitor
she
gazed
sharply
from
him
to
her
son
kybird
expression
was
now
normal
but
despite
his
utmost
efforts
mr
silk
could
not
entirely
banish
the
smile
which
trembled
on
his
lips
me
and
teddy
said
kybird
turning
to
her
with
a
little
bob
which
served
him
for
a
bow
just
been
having
a
little
talk
about
old
times
he
was
just
passing
said
mr
silk
just
passing
and
thought
i
look
in
said
kybird
with
a
careless
little
laugh
the
door
was
open
a
bit
wide
open
corroborated
mr
silk
so
i
just
came
in
to
say
ow
d
do
said
kybird
mrs
silk
sharp
white
face
turned
from
one
to
the
other
ave
you
said
it
she
inquired
blandly
i
said
kybird
restraining
mr
silk
evident
intention
of
hot
speech
by
a
warning
glance
and
now
i
just
toddle
off
i
go
a
bit
o
the
way
with
you
said
edward
silk
i
feel
as
if
a
bit
of
a
walk
would
do
me
good
left
alone
the
astonished
mrs
silk
took
the
visitor
vacated
chair
and
with
wrinkled
brow
sat
putting
two
and
two
together
until
the
sum
got
beyond
her
powers
of
calculation
kybird
affability
and
teddy
cheerfulness
were
alike
incomprehensible
she
mended
a
hole
in
her
pocket
and
darned
a
pair
of
socks
and
at
last
anxious
for
advice
or
at
least
a
confidant
resolved
to
see
wilks
she
opened
the
door
and
looked
across
the
alley
and
saw
with
some
satisfaction
that
his
blind
was
illuminated
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
sharply
and
then
stood
gasping
on
the
doorstep
so
simultaneous
were
the
two
happenings
that
it
actually
appeared
as
though
the
closing
of
the
door
had
blown
wilks
lamp
out
it
was
a
night
of
surprises
but
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
stepped
over
and
tried
his
door
it
was
fast
and
there
was
no
answer
to
her
knuckling
she
knocked
louder
and
listened
a
door
slammed
violently
at
the
back
of
the
house
a
distant
clatter
of
what
sounded
like
saucepans
came
from
beyond
and
above
it
all
a
tremulous
but
harsh
voice
bellowed
industriously
through
an
interminable
chant
by
the
time
the
third
verse
was
reached
wilks
neighbours
on
both
sides
were
beating
madly
upon
their
walls
and
threats
strained
through
the
plaster
she
stayed
no
longer
but
regaining
her
own
door
sat
down
again
to
await
the
return
of
her
son
mr
silk
was
long
in
coming
and
she
tried
in
vain
to
occupy
herself
with
various
small
jobs
as
she
speculated
in
vain
on
the
meaning
of
the
events
of
the
night
she
got
up
and
stood
by
the
open
door
and
as
she
waited
the
clock
in
the
which
rose
over
the
roofs
hard
by
slowly
boomed
out
the
hour
of
eleven
as
the
echoes
of
the
last
stroke
died
away
the
figure
of
mr
silk
turned
into
the
alley
you
must
quite
a
nice
walk
said
his
mother
as
she
drew
back
into
the
room
and
noted
the
brightness
of
his
eye
yes
was
the
reply
i
been
and
asked
you
to
the
wedding
said
the
sarcastic
mrs
silk
her
son
started
and
turning
his
back
on
her
wound
up
the
clock
yes
has
he
said
with
a
sly
grin
mrs
silk
eyes
snapped
well
of
all
the
impudence
she
said
breathlessly
well
has
said
her
son
hugging
himself
over
the
joke
and
what
more
i
going
he
composed
his
face
sufficiently
to
bid
her
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
her
remonstrances
and
inquiries
took
up
a
candle
and
were
off
whistling
illustration
he
took
up
his
candle
and
went
off
whistling
chapter
xxiv
the
idea
in
the
mind
of
james
hardy
when
he
concocted
his
infamous
plot
was
that
jack
nugent
would
be
summarily
dismissed
on
some
pretext
by
miss
kybird
and
that
steps
would
at
once
be
taken
by
her
family
to
publish
her
banns
together
with
those
of
mr
silk
in
thinking
thus
he
had
made
no
allowance
for
the
workings
and
fears
of
such
a
capable
mind
as
nathan
smith
and
as
days
passed
and
nothing
happened
he
became
a
prey
to
despair
he
watched
mr
silk
keenly
but
that
gentleman
went
about
his
work
in
his
usual
quiet
and
gloomy
fashion
and
after
a
day
leave
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
the
affairs
of
a
sick
aunt
in
camberwell
came
back
only
a
little
less
gloomy
than
before
it
was
also
clear
that
complaisance
was
nearly
at
an
end
and
a
letter
couched
in
vigorous
not
to
say
regrettable
terms
for
a
moribund
man
expressed
such
a
desire
for
fresh
air
and
exercise
that
hardy
was
prepared
to
see
him
at
any
moment
it
was
the
more
unfortunate
as
he
thought
that
he
had
of
late
detected
a
slight
softening
in
captain
nugent
manner
towards
him
on
two
occasions
the
captain
who
was
out
when
he
called
had
made
no
comment
to
find
upon
his
return
that
the
visitor
was
being
entertained
by
his
daughter
going
so
far
indeed
as
to
permit
the
conversation
to
gain
vastly
in
interest
by
that
young
person
remaining
in
the
room
in
face
of
this
improvement
he
thought
with
dismay
of
having
to
confess
failure
in
a
scheme
which
apart
from
success
was
inexcusable
the
captain
had
also
unbent
in
another
direction
and
wilks
to
his
great
satisfaction
was
allowed
to
renew
his
visits
to
equator
lodge
and
assist
his
old
master
in
the
garden
here
at
least
the
steward
was
safe
from
the
designs
of
mrs
silk
and
the
innuendoes
of
fullalove
alley
it
was
at
this
time
too
that
the
widow
stood
in
most
need
of
his
advice
the
behaviour
of
edward
silk
being
of
a
nature
to
cause
misgivings
in
any
mother
heart
a
strange
restlessness
possessed
him
varied
with
occasional
outbursts
of
hilarity
and
good
nature
dark
hints
emanated
from
him
at
these
times
concerning
a
surprise
in
store
for
her
at
no
distant
date
hints
which
were
at
once
explained
away
in
a
most
unsatisfactory
manner
when
she
became
too
pressing
in
her
inquiries
he
haunted
the
high
street
and
when
the
suspicious
mrs
silk
spoke
of
amelia
he
only
laughed
and
waxed
humorous
over
such
unlikely
subjects
as
broken
hearts
and
broken
vows
it
was
a
week
after
kybird
visit
to
the
alley
that
he
went
as
usual
for
a
stroll
up
and
down
the
high
street
the
evening
was
deepening
and
some
of
the
shops
had
already
lit
up
as
mr
silk
with
his
face
against
the
tried
in
vain
to
penetrate
the
obscurity
of
kybird
shop
he
could
just
make
out
a
dim
figure
behind
the
counter
which
he
believed
to
be
amelia
when
a
match
was
struck
and
a
gas
jet
threw
a
sudden
light
in
the
shop
and
revealed
jack
nugent
standing
behind
the
counter
with
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
illustration
he
could
just
make
out
a
dim
figure
behind
the
counter
one
glance
was
sufficient
the
next
moment
there
was
a
sharp
cry
from
miss
kybird
and
a
bewildered
stare
from
nugent
as
something
only
comparable
to
a
human
cracker
bounced
into
the
shop
and
commenced
to
explode
before
them
take
your
off
raved
mr
silk
leave
alone
dare
you
d
hear
me
i
wo
it
i
wo

remonstrated
nugent
following
up
miss
kybird
as
she
edged
away
from
him
leave
alone
d
yelled
mr
silk
thumping
the
counter
with
his
small
fist
she
my
teddy
mad
said
nugent
calmly
stark
staring
raving
mad
poor
teddy
he
shook
his
head
sadly
and
had
just
begun
to
recommend
a
few
remedies
when
the
parlour
door
opened
and
the
figure
of
kybird
with
his
wife
standing
close
behind
him
appeared
in
the
doorway
who
making
all
this
noise
demanded
the
former
looking
from
one
to
the
other
i
am
said
mr
silk
fiercely
it
no
use
your
winking
at
me
not
going
to
any
more
of
this
nonsense
you
go
and
get
your
on
and
come
straight
off
with
me
kybird
gave
a
warning
cough

easy
teddy
he
murmured
and
do
you
cough
at
me
said
the
irritated
mr
silk
because
it
wo
do
no
good
kybird
subsided
he
was
not
going
to
quarrel
with
a
who
might
at
any
moment
be
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
is
he
mad
inquired
the
amazed
nugent
not
replied
kybird
moving
aside
to
let
his
daughter
pass
no
madder
than
you
are
wot
d
mean
mad
nugent
looked
round
in
perplexity
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
teddy
and
amelia
are
married
he
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
eagerness
i
do
said
kybird
it
seems
they
been
fond
of
one
another
all
along
and
they
went
up
all
unbeknown
last
friday
and
got
a
license
and
got
married
and
if
i
see
you
putting
your
on
shoulder
said
mr
silk
with
alarming
vagueness
but
suppose
she
asks
me
to
said
the
delighted
nugent
with
much
gravity
illustration
suppose
she
asks
me
to
said
the
delighted
nugent
with
much
gravity
look
we
do
want
none
o
your
broke
in
the
irate
kybird
pushing
her
way
past
her
husband
and
confronting
the
speaker
i
been
deceived
said
nugent
in
a
thrilling
voice
you
all
been
deceiving
me
kybird
i
blush
for
you
that
will
save
you
a
lot
of
trouble
teddy
i
would
have
believed
it
of
you
i
ca
stay
here
my
heart
is
broken
well
we
do
want
you
to
retorted
the
aggressive
kybird
you
can
take
yourself
off
as
soon
as
ever
you
like
you
ca
be
too
quick
to
please
me
nugent
bowed
and
walked
past
the
counter
and
not
even
a
bit
of
for
me
he
said
shaking
a
reproachful
head
at
the
heated
mr
silk
why
i
put
you
down
first
on
my
list
he
paused
at
the
door
and
after
a
brief
intimation
that
he
would
send
for
his
effects
on
the
following
day
provided
that
his
broken
heart
had
not
proved
fatal
in
the
meantime
waved
his
hand
to
the
company
and
departed
kybird
followed
him
to
the
door
as
though
to
see
him
off
the
premises
and
gazing
after
the
receding
figure
swelled
with
indignation
as
he
noticed
that
he
favoured
a
mode
of
progression
which
was
something
between
a
walk
and
a
hornpipe
nugent
had
not
been
in
such
spirits
since
his
return
to
sunwich
and
hardly
able
to
believe
in
his
good
fortune
he
walked
on
in
a
state
of
growing
excitement
until
he
was
clear
of
the
town
then
he
stopped
to
consider
his
next
move
and
after
a
little
deliberation
resolved
to
pay
a
visit
to
jem
hardy
and
acquaint
him
with
the
joyful
tidings
that
gentleman
however
was
out
and
nugent
somewhat
irritated
at
such
thoughtlessness
stood
in
the
road
wondering
where
to
go
next
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
him
to
sleep
that
night
without
telling
the
good
news
to
somebody
and
after
some
thought
he
selected
wilks
it
was
true
that
relations
had
been
somewhat
strained
between
them
since
the
latter
attempt
at
crimping
him
but
he
was
never
one
to
bear
malice
and
he
was
full
of
the
kindliest
thoughts
to
all
mankind
he
burst
into
wilks
front
room
suddenly
and
then
pulled
up
short
the
steward
with
a
pitiable
look
of
anxiety
on
his
pallid
features
was
leaning
awkwardly
against
the
mantelpiece
and
opposite
him
mrs
silk
sat
in
an
dissolved
in
tears
busy
sam
inquired
nugent
who
had
heard
of
the
difficulties
from
hardy
no
sir
said
wilks
hastily
sit
down
sir
he
pushed
forward
a
chair
and
almost
pulling
his
visitor
into
it
stood
over
him
attentively
and
took
his
hat
are
you
quite
sure
i
not
interrupting
you
inquired
the
thoughtful
nugent
certain
sure
sir
said
wilks
eagerly
i
was
just
a
bit
of
a
chat
with
my
neighbour
mrs
silk
that
all
the
lady
in
question
removed
her
handkerchief
from
her
eyes
and
gazed
at
him
with
reproachful
tenderness
wilks
plunged
hastily
into
conversation
she
came
over
to
tell
me
a
bit
o
news
he
said
eyeing
the
young
man
doubtfully
it
seems
that
teddy
nugent
fetched
a
mighty
sigh
and
shook
his
head
mrs
silk
gazed
at
him
earnestly
life
is
full
of
surprises
sir
she
remarked
and
sadness
added
nugent
i
hope
that
they
will
be
happy
it
struck
me
all
of
a
said
mrs
silk
rolling
her
handkerchief
into
a
ball
and
placing
it
in
her
lap
i
was
doing
a
bit
of
ironing
when
in
walks
teddy
with
amelia
kybird
and
says
they
was
married
last
friday
i
was
that
shaken
i
did
know
what
i
did
or
what
i
said
then
i
came
over
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
thought
wilks
ought
to
know
about
it
wilks
cleared
his
throat
and
turned
an
agonized
eye
on
nugent
he
would
have
liked
to
have
asked
why
mrs
silk
should
think
it
necessary
to
inform
him
but
the
fear
of
precipitating
a
crisis
stayed
his
tongue
what
i
to
do
i
do
know
continued
mrs
silk
feebly
you
two
queens
in
one
so
to
speak
but
she
was
walking
out
with
teddy
long
ago
urged
wilks
it
no
worse
now
than
then
but
i
would
be
married
by
license
said
mrs
silk
deftly
ignoring
the
remark
if
i
ca
be
asked
in
church
in
the
proper
way
i
wo
be
married
at
all
quite
right
said
nugent
there
something
so
sudden
about
a
license
he
added
with
feeling
me
and
wilks
was
talking
about
marriage
only
the
other
day
pursued
mrs
silk
with
a
bashfulness
which
set
every
nerve
in
the
steward
body
quivering
and
we
both
agreed
that
banns
was
the
proper
way
you
was
talking
about
it
corrected
wilks
in
a
hoarse
voice
you
brought
up
the
subject
and
i
agreed
with
you
not
that
it
matters
to
me
people
get
married
that
their
affair
banns
or
license
it
all
one
to
me
i
wo
be
married
by
license
said
mrs
silk
with
sudden
petulance
leastways
i
rather
not
be
she
added
softening
wilks
took
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
blew
his
nose
violently
mrs
silk
methods
of
attack
left
him
little
opportunity
for
the
plain
speaking
which
was
necessary
to
dispel
illusions
he
turned
a
watery
appealing
eye
on
to
nugent
and
saw
to
his
surprise
that
that
gentleman
was
winking
at
him
with
great
significance
and
persistence
it
would
have
needed
a
heart
of
stone
to
have
been
unaffected
by
such
misery
and
nugent
thankful
for
his
own
escape
was
in
a
singularly
merciful
mood
all
this
sounds
as
though
you
are
going
to
be
married
he
said
turning
to
mrs
silk
with
a
polite
smile
the
widow
simpered
and
looked
down
thereby
affording
nugent
an
opportunity
of
another
signal
to
the
perturbed
steward
who
sat
with
such
a
look
of
anxiety
on
his
face
lest
he
should
miss
his
cue
that
the
young
man
composure
was
tried
to
the
utmost
it
been
a
understood
thing
for
a
long
time
she
said
slowly
but
i
could
leave
my
son
while
was
single
and
nobody
to
look
after
a
good
mother
makes
a
good
wife
so
they
say
a
woman
ca
always
own
way
in
everything
and
if
it
not
to
be
by
banns
then
by
license
it
must
be
i
suppose
well
he
be
a
fortunate
man
whoever
he
is
said
nugent
with
another
warning
glance
at
wilks
and
i
only
hope
that
he
make
a
better
husband
than
you
do
sam
he
added
in
a
low
but
severe
voice
mrs
silk
gave
a
violent
start
better
husband
than
does
she
cried
sharply
wilks
ai
married
nugent
baseless
charge
took
the
steward
all
aback
he
stiffened
in
his
chair
a
picture
of
consternation
and
guilt
appeared
stamped
on
every
feature
but
he
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
look
to
eye
for
guidance
and
sufficient
strength
of
character
to
accept
this
last
bid
for
liberty
that
my
business
sir
he
quavered
in
offended
tones
but
you
ai
screamed
mrs
silk
never
mind
said
nugent
pacifically
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
it
it
a
sore
subject
with
sam
and
i
daresay
there
were
faults
on
both
sides
were
there
sam
yes
sir
said
wilks
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
hard
to
make
distinct
especially
you
you
never
told
me
you
were
married
said
mrs
silk
breathlessly
i
never
said
i
was
retorted
the
culprit
defiantly
if
people
liked
to
think
i
was
a
single
man
i
do
care
it
got
nothing
to
do
with
them
besides
she
lives
at
stepney
and
i
do
from
once
in
six
months
she
do
interfere
with
me
and
i
do
interfere
with
her
mrs
silk
got
up
from
her
chair
and
stood
confronting
him
with
her
hand
grasping
the
back
of
it
her
cold
eyes
gleamed
and
her
face
worked
with
spite
as
she
tried
in
vain
to
catch
his
eye
of
nugent
and
his
ingenuous
surprise
at
her
behaviour
she
took
no
notice
at
all
you
a
deceiver
she
gasped
you
been
behaving
like
a
single
man
and
everybody
thought
you
was
a
single
man
illustration
a
deceiver
she
gasped
i
hope
you
have
been
paying
attentions
to
anybody
sam
said
nugent
in
a
shocked
voice
said
mrs
silk
shivering
with
anger
ask
the
deceiving
villain
ask
anybody
and
see
what
they
tell
you
oh
you
wicked
man
i
wonder
you
can
look
me
in
the
face
truth
to
tell
wilks
was
looking
in
any
direction
but
hers
his
eyes
met
nugent
but
there
was
a
look
of
such
stern
disdain
on
that
gentleman
face
that
he
was
fain
to
look
away
again
was
it
a
friend
of
yours
inquired
the
artless
nugent
never
mind
said
mrs
silk
recovering
herself
never
mind
who
it
was
you
wait
till
i
go
and
tell
teddy
she
continued
turning
to
the
trembling
wilks
if
got
the
of
a
man
in
you
see
with
this
dire
threat
and
turning
occasionally
to
bestow
another
fierce
glance
upon
the
steward
she
walked
to
the
door
and
opening
it
to
its
full
extent
closed
it
behind
her
with
a
crash
and
darted
across
the
alley
to
her
own
house
the
two
men
gazed
at
each
other
without
speaking
and
then
wilks
stepping
over
to
the
door
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
you
not
afraid
of
teddy
said
the
staring
nugent
teddy
said
wilks
snapping
his
huge
fingers
i
not
afraid
fifty
teddies
but
she
might
come
back
with
if
it
ha
been
for
you
sir
i
do
know
wot
would
happened
go
and
draw
some
beer
and
get
me
a
clean
pipe
said
nugent
dropping
into
a
chair
we
both
been
mercifully
preserved
sam
and
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
drink
to
our
noble
selves
and
be
more
careful
for
the
future
wilks
obeyed
and
again
thanking
him
warmly
for
his
invaluable
services
sat
down
to
compile
a
few
facts
about
his
newly
acquired
wife
warranted
to
stand
the
severest
which
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon
them
a
task
interspersed
with
malicious
reminiscences
of
mrs
silk
attacks
on
his
liberty
he
also
insisted
on
giving
up
his
bed
to
nugent
for
the
night
i
suppose
he
said
later
on
as
nugent
after
a
faint
objection
or
two
took
his
candle
i
suppose
this
yarn
about
my
being
married
will
get
about
i
suppose
so
said
nugent
yawning
as
he
paused
with
his
foot
on
the
stair
what
about
it
nothing
said
wilks
in
a
somewhat
dissatisfied
voice
nothing
what
about
it
repeated
nugent
sternly
nothing
sir
said
wilks
with
an
insufferable
simper
nothing
only
it
make
things
a
little
hit
slow
for
me
that
all
nugent
eyed
him
for
a
space
in
speechless
amazement
and
then
with
a
few
strong
remarks
on
ingratitude
and
senile
vanity
mounted
the
winding
little
stairs
and
went
to
bed
chapter
xxv
the
day
after
mr
silk
sudden
and
unexpected
assertion
of
his
marital
rights
kybird
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
shop
basking
in
the
sun
the
high
street
was
in
a
state
of
repose
and
there
was
no
likelihood
of
a
customer
to
interfere
with
his
confidential
chat
with
nathan
smith
who
was
listening
with
an
aspect
of
great
severity
to
his
explanations
it
ought
not
to
happened
he
said
sharply
it
was
teddy
done
it
said
kybird
humbly
illustration
was
teddy
done
it
said
kybird
humbly
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
would
happened
if
i
been
there
he
observed
arrogantly
i
do
see
began
kybird
no
o
course
you
do
said
his
friend
still
it
no
use
making
a
fuss
now
the
thing
is
done
one
thing
is
i
do
suppose
it
make
any
diff
difference
suggested
kybird
after
waiting
for
him
to
finish
difference
said
smith
with
an
obvious
effort
his
face
had
lost
its
scornful
expression
and
given
way
to
one
almost
sheepish
in
its
mildness
kybird
staring
at
him
in
some
surprise
even
thought
that
he
detected
a
faint
shade
of
pink
we
ai
all
as
clever
as
wot
you
are
nat
he
said
somewhat
taken
aback
at
this
phenomenon
it
would
do
smith
made
a
strange
noise
in
his
throat
and
turned
on
him
sharply
kybird
still
staring
in
surprise
at
his
unwonted
behaviour
drew
back
a
little
and
then
his
lips
parted
and
his
eyes
grew
round
as
he
saw
the
cause
of
his
friend
concern
an
elderly
gentleman
with
a
neatly
trimmed
white
beard
and
a
yellow
rose
in
his
was
just
passing
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
his
tread
was
elastic
his
figure
as
upright
as
a
boy
and
he
swung
a
light
cane
in
his
hand
as
he
walked
as
kybird
gazed
he
bestowed
a
brisk
nod
upon
the
bewildered
smith
and
crossed
the
road
with
the
evident
intention
of
speaking
to
him
how
do
smith
he
said
in
a
kindly
voice
the
leaned
against
the
and
regarded
him
dumbly
there
was
a
twinkle
in
the
shipbroker
eyes
which
irritated
him
almost
beyond
endurance
and
in
the
doorway
kybird
his
face
mottled
with
the
intensity
of
his
emotions
stood
an
unwelcome
and
frantic
witness
of
his
shame
you
not
well
smith
said
swann
shaking
his
head
at
him
gently
you
look
like
a
man
who
has
been
doing
too
much
lately
you
been
getting
the
better
of
i
know
smith
gasped
and
eyeing
him
wickedly
strove
hard
to
recover
his
i
all
right
sir
he
said
in
a
thin
voice
i
glad
to
see
looking
a
trifle
better
sir
oh
i
quite
right
now
said
the
other
with
a
genial
smile
at
the
fermenting
kybird
i
as
well
as
ever
i
was
illness
is
a
serious
thing
smith
but
it
is
not
without
its
little
amusements
smith
scratching
his
chin
and
staring
blankly
in
front
of
him
said
that
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
i
had
a
long
bout
of
it
continued
the
longer
than
i
intended
at
first
by
the
way
smith
you
never
spoken
to
anybody
of
that
business
of
course
of
course
not
sir
said
the
grinding
his
teeth
one
has
fancies
when
one
is
ill
said
swann
in
low
tones
as
his
eye
dwelt
with
pleasure
on
the
strained
features
of
kybird
i
burnt
the
document
five
minutes
after
you
had
gone
did
you
reely
said
smith
mechanically
i
glad
it
was
only
you
and
the
doctor
that
saw
my
foolishness
continued
the
other
still
in
a
low
voice
other
people
might
have
talked
but
i
knew
that
you
were
a
reliable
man
smith
and
you
talk
about
it
in
the
future
i
quite
certain
of
that
good
afternoon
smith
managed
to
say
good
afternoon
and
stood
watching
the
receding
figure
as
though
it
belonged
to
a
species
hitherto
unknown
to
him
then
he
turned
in
obedience
to
a
passionate
tug
at
his
coat
sleeve
from
kybird
wot
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
demanded
that
injured
person
in
tones
of
suppressed
passion
wot
do
you
mean
by
it
you
made
a
pretty
mess
of
it
with
your
cleverness
wonderful
old
gentleman
ai
he
said
the
discomfited
smith
fancy
getting
the
better
o
me
fancy
me
being
i
took
it
all
in
as
innercent
as
you
please
ah

clever
fellow

are
said
kybird
bitterly
amelia
lost
young
nugent
and
five
all
through
you
it
a
thing
between
old
swann
and
the
nugent
lot
that
wot
it
is
looks
like
it
admitted
smith
but
fancy
picking
me
out
for
games
that
wot
gets
over
me
wot
about
all
that
money
i
paid
for
the
license
demanded
kybird
in
a
threatening
manner
wot
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
you
shall
it
said
the
with
sudden
blandness
and
shall
five
inquired
the
other
staring
it
as
easy
as
easy
said
smith
who
had
been
greatly
galled
by
his
friend
manner
i
leave
it
in
my
will
that
the
cheapest
way
o
giving
money
i
know
of
and
while
i
about
it
i
leave
you
a
decent
pair
o
trousers
and
a
shirt
with
your
own
name
on
it
while
an
ancient
friendship
was
thus
being
dissolved
adolphus
swann
was
on
the
way
to
his
office
he
could
never
remember
such
a
pleasant
air
from
the
water
and
such
a
vivid
enjoyment
in
the
sight
of
the
workaday
world
he
gazed
with
delight
at
the
crowd
of
miscellaneous
shipping
in
the
harbour
and
the
bustling
figures
on
the
quay
only
pausing
occasionally
to
answer
anxious
inquiries
concerning
his
health
from
seafaring
men
in
tarry
trousers
who
had
waylaid
him
with
great
pains
from
a
distance
he
reached
his
office
at
last
and
having
acknowledged
the
respectful
greetings
of
mr
silk
passed
into
the
private
room
and
celebrated
his
return
to
work
by
at
once
arranging
with
his
partner
for
a
substantial
rise
in
the
wages
of
that
useful
individual
my
conscience
is
troubling
me
he
declared
as
he
hung
up
his
hat
and
gazed
round
the
room
with
much
relish
silk
is
happy
enough
said
hardy
it
is
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
him
i
should
like
to
raise
everybody
wages
said
the
benevolent
swann
as
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
everything
is
like
a
holiday
to
me
after
being
cooped
up
in
that
bedroom
but
the
rest
has
done
me
a
lot
of
good
so
blaikie
says
and
now
what
is
going
to
happen
to
you
illustration
pausing
occasionally
to
answer
anxious
inquiries
hardy
shook
his
head
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
said
the
go
and
see
captain
nugent
before
he
has
got
used
to
the
situation
and
you
can
give
him
to
understand
if
you
like
only
be
careful
how
you
do
it
that
i
have
got
something
in
view
which
may
suit
his
son
if
you
fail
in
this
affair
after
all
i
done
for
you
i
enter
the
lists
myself
the
advice
was
good
but
unnecessary
hardy
having
already
fixed
on
that
evening
as
a
suitable
opportunity
to
disclose
to
the
captain
the
nature
of
the
efforts
he
had
been
making
on
his
behalf
the
success
which
had
attended
them
had
put
him
into
a
highly
optimistic
mood
and
he
set
off
for
equator
lodge
with
the
confident
feeling
that
he
had
to
say
the
least
of
it
improved
his
footing
there
captain
nugent
called
away
from
his
labours
in
the
garden
greeted
his
visitor
in
his
customary
short
manner
as
he
entered
the
room
if
come
to
tell
me
about
this
marriage
i
heard
of
it
he
said
bluntly
murchison
told
me
this
afternoon
he
did
tell
you
how
it
was
brought
about
i
suppose
said
hardy
the
captain
shook
his
head
i
did
ask
him
he
said
with
affected
indifference
and
sat
gazing
out
at
the
window
as
hardy
began
his
narration
two
or
three
times
he
thought
he
saw
signs
of
appreciation
in
his
listener
face
but
the
mouth
under
the
heavy
moustache
was
firm
and
the
eyes
steady
only
when
he
related
swann
interview
with
nathan
smith
and
kybird
did
the
captain
features
relax
he
gave
a
chuckling
cough
and
feeling
for
his
handkerchief
blew
his
nose
violently
then
with
a
strange
gleam
in
his
eye
he
turned
to
the
young
man
opposite
very
smart
he
said
shortly
it
was
successful
said
the
other
modestly
very
said
the
captain
as
he
rose
and
confronted
him
i
am
much
obliged
of
course
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
in
the
affairs
of
my
family
and
now
i
will
remind
you
of
our
agreement
agreement
repeated
the
other
the
captain
nodded
your
visits
to
me
were
to
cease
when
this
marriage
happened
if
i
wished
it
he
said
slowly
that
was
the
arrangement
said
the
hardy
but
i
had
hoped
besides
it
has
all
taken
place
much
sooner
than
i
had
anticipated
that
was
the
bargain
said
the
captain
stiffly
and
now
i
bid
you
i
am
sorry
that
my
presence
should
be
so
distasteful
to
you
said
the
mortified
hardy
distasteful
sir
said
the
captain
sternly
you
have
forced
yourself
on
me
for
twice
a
week
for
some
time
past
you
have
insisted
upon
talking
on
every
subject
under
the
sun
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
you
have
taken
every
opportunity
of
evading
my
wishes
that
you
should
not
see
my
daughter
and
you
wonder
that
i
object
to
you
for
absolute
brazenness
you
beat
anything
i
have
ever
encountered
i
am
sorry
said
hardy
again
good
evening
said
the
captain
good
evening
crestfallen
and
angry
hardy
moved
to
the
door
pausing
with
his
hand
on
it
as
the
captain
spoke
again
one
word
more
said
the
older
man
gazing
at
him
oddly
as
he
stroked
his
grey
beard
if
ever
you
try
to
come
bothering
me
with
your
talk
again
i
forbid
you
the
house
forbid
me
the
house
repeated
the
astonished
hardy
that
what
i
said
replied
the
other
that
plain
english
it
hardy
looked
at
him
in
bewilderment
then
as
the
captain
meaning
dawned
upon
him
he
stepped
forward
impulsively
and
seizing
his
hand
began
to
stammer
out
incoherent
thanks
you
better
clear
before
i
alter
my
mind
said
captain
nugent
roughly
i
had
more
than
enough
of
you
try
the
garden
if
you
like
he
took
up
a
paper
from
the
table
and
resumed
his
seat
not
without
a
grim
smile
at
the
promptitude
with
which
the
other
obeyed
his
instructions
miss
nugent
reclining
in
a
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
looked
up
as
she
heard
hardy
footstep
on
the
gravel
it
was
a
surprising
thing
to
see
him
walking
down
the
garden
it
was
still
more
surprising
to
observe
the
brightness
of
his
eye
and
the
easy
confidence
of
his
bearing
it
was
evident
that
he
was
highly
pleased
with
himself
and
she
was
not
satisfied
until
she
had
ascertained
the
reason
then
she
sat
silent
reflecting
bitterly
on
the
clumsy
frankness
of
the
male
sex
in
general
and
fathers
in
particular
a
recent
conversation
with
the
captain
in
which
she
had
put
in
a
casual
word
or
two
in
hardy
favour
was
suddenly
invested
with
a
new
significance
i
shall
never
be
able
to
repay
your
father
for
his
kindness
said
hardy
meaningly
as
he
took
a
chair
near
her
i
expect
he
was
pleased
at
this
marriage
said
miss
nugent
coldly
how
did
it
happen
hardy
shifted
uneasily
in
his
chair
there
is
much
to
tell
he
said
reluctantly
and
you
you
might
not
approve
of
the
means
by
which
the
end
was
gained
still
i
want
to
hear
about
it
said
miss
nugent
for
the
second
time
that
evening
hardy
told
his
story
it
seemed
more
discreditable
each
time
he
told
it
and
he
scanned
the
girl
face
anxiously
as
he
proceeded
but
like
her
father
she
sat
still
and
made
no
comment
until
he
had
finished
then
she
expressed
a
strong
feeling
of
gratitude
that
the
nugent
family
had
not
been
mixed
up
in
it
why
inquired
hardy
bluntly
i
do
think
it
was
a
very
nice
thing
to
do
said
miss
nugent
with
a
superior
air
it
would
have
been
a
very
nice
thing
for
you
if
your
brother
had
married
miss
kybird
said
the
indignant
jem
and
you
said
if
you
remember
that
you
did
mind
what
i
did
i
do
said
miss
nugent
noticing
with
pleasure
that
the
confident
air
of
a
few
minutes
ago
had
quite
disappeared
you
think
i
have
been
behaving
badly
pursued
hardy
i
would
rather
not
say
what
i
think
replied
miss
nugent
loftily
i
have
no
doubt
you
meant
well
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
hurt
your
feelings
thank
you
said
hardy
and
sat
gloomily
gazing
about
him
for
some
time
neither
of
them
spoke
where
is
jack
now
inquired
the
girl
at
last
he
is
staying
with
me
for
a
few
days
said
hardy
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
association
will
not
be
injurious
to
him
are
you
trying
to
be
rude
to
me
inquired
miss
nugent
raising
her
clear
eyes
to
his
i
am
sorry
said
hardy
hastily
you
are
quite
right
of
course
it
was
not
a
nice
thing
to
do
but
i
would
do
a
thousand
times
worse
to
please
you
miss
nugent
thanked
him
warmly
he
seemed
to
understand
her
so
well
she
said
i
mean
said
hardy
leaning
forward
and
speaking
with
a
vehemence
which
made
the
girl
instinctively
avert
her
head
i
mean
that
to
please
you
would
be
the
greatest
happiness
i
could
know
i
love
you
miss
nugent
sat
silent
and
a
strong
sense
of
the
monstrous
unfairness
of
such
a
sudden
attack
possessed
her
such
a
declaration
she
felt
ought
to
have
been
led
up
to
by
numerous
delicate
gradations
of
speech
each
a
little
more
daring
than
the
last
but
none
so
daring
that
they
could
not
have
been
checked
at
any
time
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
firmness
if
you
would
do
anything
to
please
me
she
said
at
length
in
a
low
voice
and
without
turning
her
head
would
you
promise
never
to
try
and
see
me
or
speak
to
me
again
if
i
asked
you
no
said
hardy
promptly
miss
nugent
sat
silent
again
she
knew
that
a
good
woman
should
be
sorry
for
a
man
in
such
extremity
and
should
endeavour
to
spare
his
feelings
by
softening
her
refusal
as
much
as
possible
little
as
he
might
deserve
such
consideration
but
man
is
impatient
and
jumps
at
conclusions
before
she
was
through
the
first
sentence
he
leaned
forward
and
took
her
hand
oh
she
said
turning
to
him
with
a
pleasant
smile
i
am
not
going
said
hardy
quietly
i
am
never
going
he
added
as
he
took
her
other
hand
captain
nugent
anxious
for
his
supper
found
them
there
still
debating
the
point
some
two
hours
later
kate
nugent
relieved
at
the
appearance
of
her
natural
protector
clung
to
him
with
unusual
warmth
then
in
a
kindly
hospitable
fashion
she
placed
her
other
arm
in
that
of
hardy
and
they
walked
in
grave
silence
to
the
house
illustration
she
placed
her
other
arm
in
that
of
hardy
the
end
