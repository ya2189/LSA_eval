the
history
of
willie
chapter
i
who
he
was
and
where
he
was
when
he
had
been
at
school
for
about
three
weeks
the
boys
called
him
jack
but
his
real
name
was
willie
for
his
father
and
mother
gave
it
him
not
william
but
willie
after
a
brother
of
his
father
who
died
young
and
had
always
been
called
willie
his
name
in
full
was
willie
macmichael
it
was
generally
pronounced
macmickle
which
was
by
a
learned
anthropologist
for
certain
reasons
about
to
appear
in
this
history
supposed
to
have
been
the
original
form
of
the
name
dignified
in
the
course
of
time
into
macmichael
it
was
his
own
father
however
who
gave
him
the
name
of
willie
the
reason
of
which
will
also
show
itself
by
and
by
mr
macmichael
was
a
country
doctor
living
in
a
small
village
in
a
country
the
first
result
of
which
was
that
he
had
very
hard
work
for
he
had
often
to
ride
many
miles
to
see
a
patient
and
that
not
unfrequently
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
the
second
that
for
this
hard
work
he
had
very
little
pay
for
a
country
is
generally
a
poor
country
and
those
who
live
in
it
are
poor
also
and
can
not
spend
much
even
upon
their
health
but
the
doctor
not
only
preferred
a
country
life
although
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
richer
patients
and
within
less
distances
of
each
other
but
he
would
say
to
any
one
who
expressed
surprise
that
with
his
reputation
he
should
remain
where
he
was
what
to
become
of
my
little
flock
if
i
go
away
for
there
are
very
few
doctors
of
my
experience
who
would
feel
inclined
to
come
and
undertake
my
work
i
know
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
whole
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
you
see
therefore
that
he
was
a
good
man
and
loved
his
work
for
the
sake
of
those
whom
he
helped
by
it
better
than
the
money
he
received
for
it
their
home
was
necessarily
a
very
humble
one
a
neat
little
cottage
in
the
village
of
priory
leas
almost
the
one
pretty
spot
thereabout
it
lay
in
a
valley
in
the
midst
of
hills
which
did
not
look
high
because
they
rose
with
a
gentle
slope
and
had
no
bold
elevations
or
peaks
but
they
rose
to
a
good
height
notwithstanding
and
the
weather
on
the
top
of
them
in
the
wintertime
was
often
bitter
and
fierce
bitter
with
keen
frost
and
fierce
with
as
wild
winds
as
ever
blew
of
both
frost
and
wind
the
village
at
their
feet
had
its
share
too
but
of
course
they
were
not
so
bad
down
below
for
the
hills
were
a
shelter
from
the
wind
and
it
is
always
colder
the
farther
you
go
up
and
away
from
the
heart
of
this
warm
ball
of
rock
and
earth
upon
which
we
live
when
willie
father
was
riding
across
the
great
moorland
of
those
desolate
hills
and
the
people
in
the
village
would
be
saying
to
each
other
how
bitterly
cold
it
was
he
would
be
thinking
how
snug
and
warm
it
was
down
there
and
how
nice
it
would
be
to
turn
a
certain
corner
on
the
road
back
and
slip
at
once
out
of
the
freezing
wind
that
had
it
all
its
own
way
up
among
the
withered
gorse
and
heather
of
the
wide
expanse
where
he
pursued
his
dreary
journey
for
his
part
willie
cared
very
little
what
the
weather
was
but
took
it
as
it
came
in
the
hot
summer
he
would
lie
in
the
long
grass
and
get
cool
in
the
cold
winter
he
would
scamper
about
and
get
warm
when
his
hands
were
as
cold
as
icicles
his
cheeks
would
be
red
as
apples
when
his
mother
took
his
hands
in
hers
and
chafed
them
full
of
pity
for
their
suffering
as
she
thought
it
willie
first
knew
that
they
were
cold
by
the
sweet
warmth
of
the
kind
hands
that
chafed
them
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
climbing
amongst
the
ruins
of
the
priory
or
playing
with
farmer
thomson
boys
and
girls
about
the
ricks
in
his
yard
in
the
thin
clear
saffron
twilight
which
came
so
early
after
noon
when
to
some
people
every
breath
seemed
full
of
so
sharp
was
the
cold
he
was
as
comfortable
and
happy
as
if
he
had
been
a
creature
of
the
winter
only
and
found
himself
quite
at
home
in
it
for
there
were
ruins
and
pretty
large
ruins
too
which
they
called
the
priory
it
was
not
often
that
monks
chose
such
a
poor
country
to
settle
in
but
i
suppose
they
had
their
reasons
and
i
dare
say
they
were
not
monks
at
all
but
begging
friars
who
founded
it
when
they
wanted
to
reprove
the
luxury
and
greed
of
the
monks
and
perhaps
by
the
time
they
had
grown
as
bad
themselves
the
place
was
nearly
finished
and
they
could
not
well
move
it
they
had
however
as
i
have
indicated
chosen
the
one
pretty
spot
around
which
for
a
short
distance
on
every
side
the
land
was
tolerably
good
and
grew
excellent
oats
if
poor
wheat
while
the
gardens
were
equal
to
apples
and
a
few
pears
besides
abundance
of
gooseberries
currants
and
strawberries
the
ruins
of
the
priory
lay
behind
mr
macmichael
cottage
indeed
in
the
very
garden
of
which
along
with
the
house
he
had
purchased
the
fen
that
is
the
place
was
his
own
so
long
as
he
paid
a
small
sum
not
more
than
fifteen
shillings
a
year
i
think
to
his
superior
how
long
it
was
since
the
priory
had
come
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
mere
encumbrance
of
a
cottage
garden
nobody
thereabouts
knew
and
although
by
this
time
i
presume
archaeologists
have
ferreted
out
everything
concerning
it
nobody
except
its
owner
had
then
taken
the
trouble
to
make
the
least
inquiry
into
its
history
to
willie
it
was
just
the
priory
as
naturally
in
his
father
garden
as
if
every
garden
had
similar
ruins
to
adorn
or
encumber
it
according
as
the
owner
might
choose
to
regard
its
presence
the
ruins
were
of
considerable
extent
with
remains
of
gothic
arches
and
carvings
about
the
doors
all
open
to
the
sky
except
a
few
places
on
the
which
were
vaulted
these
being
still
perfectly
solid
were
used
by
the
family
as
outhouses
to
store
wood
and
peats
to
keep
the
garden
tools
in
and
for
such
like
purposes
in
summer
golden
flowers
grew
on
the
broken
walls
in
winter
grey
frosts
edged
them
against
the
sky
i
fancy
the
whole
garden
was
but
the
space
once
occupied
by
the
huge
building
for
its
surface
was
the
most
irregular
i
ever
saw
in
a
garden
it
was
up
and
down
up
and
down
in
whatever
direction
you
went
mounded
with
heaps
of
ruins
over
which
the
mould
had
gathered
for
many
years
bushes
and
flowers
had
grown
upon
them
and
you
might
dig
a
good
way
without
coming
to
the
stones
though
come
to
them
you
must
at
last
the
walks
wound
about
between
the
heaps
and
through
the
thick
walls
of
the
ruin
overgrown
with
lichens
and
mosses
now
and
then
passing
through
an
arched
door
or
window
of
the
ancient
building
it
was
a
generous
garden
in
flowers
and
vegetables
there
were
a
few
apple
and
pear
trees
also
on
a
wall
that
faced
the
south
which
were
regarded
by
willie
with
mingled
respect
and
desire
for
he
was
not
allowed
to
touch
them
while
of
the
gooseberries
he
was
allowed
to
eat
as
many
as
he
pleased
when
they
were
ripe
and
of
the
currants
too
after
his
mother
had
had
as
many
as
she
wanted
for
preserves
some
spots
were
much
too
shady
to
allow
either
fruit
or
flowers
to
grow
in
them
so
high
and
close
were
the
walls
but
i
need
not
say
more
about
the
garden
now
for
i
shall
have
occasion
to
refer
to
it
again
and
again
and
i
must
not
tell
all
i
know
at
once
else
how
should
i
make
a
story
of
it
chapter
ii
willie
education
willie
was
a
good
deal
more
than
nine
years
of
age
before
he
could
read
a
single
word
it
was
not
that
he
was
stupid
as
we
shall
soon
see
but
that
he
had
not
learned
the
good
of
reading
and
therefore
had
not
begun
to
wish
to
read
and
his
father
had
unusual
ideas
about
how
he
ought
to
be
educated
he
said
he
would
no
more
think
of
making
willie
learn
to
read
before
he
wished
to
be
taught
than
he
would
make
him
eat
if
he
was
hungry
the
gift
of
reading
he
said
was
too
good
a
thing
to
give
him
before
he
wished
to
have
it
or
knew
the
value
of
it
would
you
give
him
a
watch
he
would
say
before
he
cares
to
know
whether
the
sun
rises
in
the
east
or
the
west
or
at
what
hour
dinner
will
be
ready
now
i
am
not
very
sure
how
this
would
work
with
some
boys
and
girls
i
am
afraid
they
might
never
learn
to
read
until
they
had
boys
and
girls
of
their
own
whom
they
wanted
to
be
better
off
than
because
of
their
ignorance
they
had
been
themselves
but
it
worked
well
in
case
who
was
neither
lazy
nor
idle
and
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
he
was
left
without
any
education
at
all
for
one
thing
his
father
and
mother
used
to
talk
very
freely
before
him
much
more
so
than
most
parents
do
in
the
presence
of
their
children
and
nothing
serves
better
for
teaching
than
the
conversation
of
good
and
thoughtful
people
while
they
talked
willie
would
sit
listening
intently
trying
to
understand
what
he
heard
and
although
it
not
unfrequently
took
very
strange
shapes
in
his
little
mind
because
at
times
he
understood
neither
the
words
nor
the
things
the
words
represented
yet
there
was
much
that
he
did
understand
and
make
a
good
use
of
for
instance
he
soon
came
to
know
that
his
father
and
mother
had
very
little
money
to
spare
and
that
his
father
had
to
work
hard
to
get
what
money
they
had
he
learned
also
that
everything
that
came
into
the
house
or
was
done
for
them
cost
money
therefore
for
one
thing
he
must
not
his
clothes
he
learned
too
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
suffering
in
the
world
and
that
his
father
business
was
to
try
to
make
it
less
and
help
people
who
were
ill
to
grow
well
again
and
be
able
to
do
their
work
and
this
made
him
see
what
a
useful
man
his
father
was
and
wish
to
be
also
of
some
good
in
the
world
then
he
looked
about
him
and
saw
that
there
were
a
great
many
ways
of
getting
money
that
is
a
great
many
things
for
doing
which
people
would
give
money
and
he
saw
that
some
of
those
ways
were
better
than
others
and
he
thought
his
father
way
the
very
best
of
all
i
give
these
as
specimens
of
the
lessons
he
learned
by
listening
to
his
father
and
mother
as
they
talked
together
but
he
had
another
teacher
down
the
street
of
the
village
which
was
very
straggling
with
nearly
as
many
little
gardens
as
houses
in
it
there
was
a
house
occupied
by
several
poor
people
in
one
end
of
which
consisting
just
of
a
room
and
a
closet
an
old
woman
lived
who
got
her
money
by
spinning
flax
into
yarn
for
making
linen
she
was
a
old
creature
widow
without
any
relation
near
to
help
her
or
look
after
her
she
had
had
one
child
who
died
before
he
was
as
old
as
willie
that
was
forty
years
before
but
she
had
never
forgotten
her
little
willie
for
that
was
his
name
too
and
she
fancied
our
willie
was
like
him
nothing
therefore
pleased
her
better
than
to
get
him
into
her
little
room
and
talk
to
him
she
would
take
a
little
bit
of
or
liquorice
out
of
her
cupboard
for
him
and
tell
him
some
strange
old
fairy
tale
or
legend
while
she
sat
spinning
until
at
last
she
had
made
him
so
fond
of
her
that
he
would
often
go
and
stay
for
hours
with
her
nor
did
it
make
much
difference
when
his
mother
begged
mrs
wilson
to
give
him
something
sweet
only
now
and
then
for
she
was
afraid
of
his
going
to
see
the
old
woman
merely
for
what
she
gave
him
which
would
have
been
greedy
but
the
fact
was
he
liked
her
stories
better
than
her
and
liquorice
while
above
all
things
he
delighted
in
watching
the
wonderful
wheel
go
round
and
round
so
fast
that
he
could
not
find
out
whether
her
foot
was
making
it
spin
or
it
was
making
her
foot
dance
up
and
down
in
that
curious
way
after
she
had
explained
it
to
him
as
well
as
she
could
and
he
thought
he
understood
it
it
seemed
to
him
only
the
more
wonderful
and
mysterious
and
ever
as
it
went
whirring
round
it
sung
a
song
of
its
own
which
was
also
the
song
of
the
story
whatever
it
was
that
the
old
woman
was
telling
him
as
he
sat
listening
in
her
high
soft
chair
covered
with
chintz
and
cushioned
like
a
nest
for
mrs
wilson
had
had
a
better
house
to
live
in
once
and
this
chair
as
well
as
the
chest
of
drawers
of
dark
mahogany
with
brass
handles
that
stood
opposite
the
window
was
part
of
the
furniture
she
saved
when
she
had
to
sell
the
rest
and
well
it
was
she
used
to
say
for
her
old
rheumatic
bones
that
she
had
saved
the
chair
at
least
in
that
chair
then
the
little
boy
would
sit
coiled
up
as
nearly
into
a
ball
as
might
be
like
a
young
bird
or
a
rabbit
in
its
nest
staring
at
the
wheel
and
listening
with
two
ears
and
one
heart
to
its
song
and
the
old
tale
both
at
once
illustration
willie
liked
mrs
wilson
stories
better
than
her
sugar
candy
one
sultry
summer
afternoon
his
mother
not
being
very
well
and
having
gone
to
lie
down
his
father
being
out
as
he
so
often
was
upon
scramble
the
old
horse
and
tibby
their
only
servant
being
busy
with
the
ironing
willie
ran
off
to
widow
wilson
and
was
soon
curled
up
in
the
chair
like
a
little
hindoo
idol
that
had
grown
weary
of
sitting
upright
and
had
tumbled
itself
into
a
corner
now
before
he
came
the
old
woman
had
been
thinking
about
him
and
wishing
very
much
that
he
would
come
turning
over
also
in
her
mind
as
she
spun
all
her
stock
of
stories
in
the
hope
of
finding
in
some
nook
or
other
one
she
had
not
yet
told
him
for
although
he
had
not
yet
begun
to
grow
tired
even
of
those
he
knew
best
it
was
a
special
treat
to
have
a
new
one
for
by
this
time
mrs
wilson
store
was
all
but
exhausted
and
a
new
one
turned
up
very
rarely
this
time
however
she
was
successful
and
did
call
to
mind
one
that
she
had
not
thought
of
before
it
had
not
only
grown
very
dusty
but
was
full
of
little
holes
which
she
at
once
set
about
darning
up
with
the
needle
and
thread
of
her
imagination
so
that
by
the
time
willie
arrived
she
had
a
treat
as
she
thought
quite
ready
for
him
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
the
story
which
was
about
a
poor
boy
who
received
from
a
fairy
to
whom
he
had
shown
some
kindness
the
gift
of
a
marvelous
wand
in
the
shape
of
a
common
blackthorn
which
nobody
could
suspect
of
possessing
such
wonderful
virtue
by
means
of
it
he
was
able
to
do
anything
he
wished
without
the
least
trouble
and
so
upon
a
trial
of
skill
appointed
by
a
certain
king
in
order
to
find
out
which
of
the
craftsmen
of
his
realm
was
fittest
to
aid
him
in
ruling
it
he
found
it
easy
to
surpass
every
one
of
them
each
in
his
own
trade
he
produced
a
richer
damask
than
any
of
the
a
finer
linen
than
any
of
the
a
more
complicated
as
well
as
ornate
cabinet
with
more
drawers
and
quaint
than
any
of
the
a
more
cunningly
damasked
and
a
hilt
more
gorgeously
jewelled
than
any
of
the
a
ring
set
with
stones
more
precious
more
brilliant
in
colour
and
more
beautifully
combined
than
any
of
the
jewellers
in
short
as
i
say
without
knowing
a
single
device
of
one
of
the
arts
in
question
he
surpassed
every
one
of
the
competitors
in
his
own
craft
won
the
favour
of
the
king
and
the
office
he
wished
to
confer
and
if
i
remember
rightly
gained
at
length
the
king
daughter
to
boot
for
a
long
time
willie
had
not
uttered
a
single
exclamation
and
when
the
old
woman
looked
up
fancying
he
must
be
asleep
she
saw
to
her
disappointment
a
cloud
upon
his
face
amounting
to
a
frown
what
the
matter
with
you
willie
my
chick
she
asked
have
you
got
a
headache
no
thank
you
mrs
wilson
answered
willie
but
i
do
like
that
story
at
all
i
sorry
for
that
i
thought
i
should
be
sure
to
please
you
this
time
it
is
one
i
never
told
you
before
for
i
had
quite
forgotten
it
myself
till
this
very
afternoon
why
do
you
like
it
because
he
was
a
cheat
could
do
the
things
it
was
only
the
fairy
wand
that
did
them
but
he
was
such
a
good
lad
and
had
been
so
kind
to
the
fairy
that
makes
no
difference
he
good
and
the
fairy
was
good
either
or
she
would
have
set
him
to
do
such
wicked
things
they
were
wicked
things
they
were
all
everything
that
he
made
better
than
any
one
else
could
make
them
but
he
did
make
them
there
was
one
of
those
poor
fellows
he
cheated
that
was
a
better
man
than
he
the
worst
of
them
could
do
something
with
his
own
hands
and
i
do
believe
he
could
do
anything
for
if
he
had
ever
tried
he
would
have
hated
to
be
such
a
sneak
he
cheated
the
king
too
and
the
princess
and
everybody
oh
i
like
to
have
been
there
and
to
have
beaten
him
wand
and
all
for
somebody
might
have
been
able
to
make
the
things
better
still
if
he
had
only
known
how
mrs
wilson
was
disappointed
perhaps
a
little
ashamed
that
she
had
not
thought
of
this
before
anyhow
she
grew
cross
and
because
she
was
cross
she
grew
unfair
and
said
to
willie
you
think
a
great
deal
of
yourself
master
willie
pray
what
could
those
idle
little
hands
of
yours
do
if
you
were
to
try
i
do
know
for
i
have
tried
answered
willie
it
a
pity
you
should
she
rejoined
if
you
think
they
would
turn
out
so
very
clever
she
did
mean
anything
but
crossness
when
she
said
this
for
which
probably
a
severe
rheumatic
twinge
which
just
then
passed
through
her
shoulder
was
also
partly
to
blame
but
willie
took
her
up
quite
seriously
and
asked
in
a
tone
that
showed
he
wanted
it
accounted
for
why
have
i
ever
done
anything
mrs
wilson
you
ought
to
know
that
best
yourself
she
answered
still
cross
i
suppose
because
you
do
like
work
your
good
father
and
mother
work
very
hard
i
sure
it
a
shame
of
you
to
be
so
idle
this
was
rather
hard
on
a
boy
of
seven
for
willie
was
no
more
then
it
made
him
look
very
grave
indeed
if
not
unhappy
for
a
little
while
as
he
sat
turning
over
the
thing
in
his
mind
is
it
wrong
to
play
about
mrs
wilson
he
asked
after
a
pause
of
considerable
duration
no
indeed
my
dear
she
answered
for
during
the
pause
she
had
begun
to
be
sorry
for
having
spoken
so
roughly
to
her
little
darling
does
everybody
work
everybody
that
worth
anything
and
is
old
enough
she
added
does
god
work
he
asked
after
another
pause
in
a
low
voice
no
child
what
should
he
work
for
if
everybody
works
that
is
good
and
old
enough
then
i
think
god
must
work
answered
willie
but
i
will
ask
my
papa
am
i
old
enough
well
you
not
old
enough
to
do
much
but
you
might
do
something
what
could
i
do
could
i
spin
mrs
wilson
no
child
that
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
but
you
could
knit
could
i
what
good
would
it
do
why
you
could
knit
your
mother
a
pair
of
stockings
could
i
though
will
you
teach
me
mrs
wilson
mrs
wilson
very
readily
promised
foreseeing
that
so
she
might
have
a
good
deal
more
of
the
little
man
company
if
indeed
he
was
in
earnest
for
she
was
very
lonely
and
was
never
so
happy
as
when
he
was
with
her
she
said
she
would
get
him
some
wires
she
called
them
that
very
evening
she
had
some
wool
and
if
he
came
she
would
soon
see
whether
he
was
old
enough
and
clever
enough
to
learn
to
knit
she
advised
him
however
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
his
mother
till
she
had
made
up
her
mind
whether
or
not
he
could
learn
for
if
he
could
then
he
might
surprise
her
by
taking
her
something
of
his
own
knitting
at
least
a
pair
of
muffetees
to
keep
her
wrists
warm
in
the
winter
willie
went
home
solemn
with
his
secret
the
next
day
he
began
to
learn
and
although
his
fingers
annoyed
him
a
good
deal
at
first
by
refusing
to
do
exactly
as
he
wanted
them
they
soon
became
more
obedient
and
before
the
new
year
arrived
he
had
actually
knitted
a
pair
of
warm
white
stockings
for
his
mother
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
when
first
they
were
finished
they
were
a
good
deal
soiled
by
having
been
on
the
way
so
long
and
perhaps
partly
by
the
little
hands
not
always
being
so
clean
as
they
might
have
been
when
he
turned
from
play
to
work
but
mrs
wilson
washed
them
herself
and
they
looked
if
not
as
white
as
snow
at
least
as
white
as
the
whitest
lamb
you
ever
saw
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
delight
of
his
mother
the
triumph
of
willie
or
the
gratification
of
his
father
who
saw
in
this
good
promise
of
his
boy
capacity
for
all
that
i
have
written
hitherto
is
only
introductory
to
my
story
and
i
long
to
begin
and
tell
it
you
in
a
regular
straightforward
fashion
before
i
begin
however
i
must
not
forget
to
tell
you
that
willie
did
ask
his
father
the
question
with
mrs
wilson
answer
to
which
he
had
not
been
satisfied
i
mean
the
question
whether
god
worked
and
his
answer
after
he
had
sat
pondering
for
a
while
in
his
chair
was
something
to
this
effect
yes
willie
it
seems
to
me
that
god
works
more
than
anybody
for
he
works
all
night
and
all
day
and
if
i
remember
rightly
jesus
tells
us
somewhere
that
he
works
all
sunday
too
if
he
were
to
stop
working
everything
would
stop
being
the
sun
would
stop
shining
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
the
corn
would
stop
growing
there
would
be
no
more
apples
or
gooseberries
your
eyes
would
stop
seeing
your
ears
would
stop
hearing
your
fingers
could
move
an
inch
and
worst
of
all
your
little
heart
would
stop
loving
no
papa
cried
willie
i
should
stop
loving
i
sure
indeed
you
would
willie
not
you
and
mamma
yes
you
would
love
us
any
more
than
if
you
were
dead
asleep
without
dreaming
that
would
be
dreadful
yes
it
would
so
you
see
how
good
god
is
to
us
to
go
on
working
that
we
may
be
able
to
love
each
other
then
if
god
works
like
that
all
day
long
it
must
be
a
fine
thing
to
work
said
willie
you
are
right
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
work
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
if
it
comes
of
love
as
god
work
does
this
conversation
made
willie
quite
determined
to
learn
to
knit
for
if
god
worked
he
would
work
too
and
although
the
work
he
undertook
was
a
very
small
work
it
was
like
all
god
great
works
for
every
loop
he
made
had
a
little
love
looped
up
in
it
like
an
invisible
softest
downiest
lining
to
the
stockings
and
after
those
he
went
on
knitting
a
pair
for
his
father
and
indeed
although
he
learned
to
work
with
a
needle
as
well
and
to
darn
the
stockings
he
had
made
and
even
tried
his
hand
at
the
spinning
of
which
however
he
could
not
make
much
for
a
long
time
he
had
not
left
off
knitting
when
we
come
to
begin
the
story
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
iii
he
is
turned
into
something
he
never
was
before
hitherto
i
have
been
mixing
up
summer
and
winter
and
everything
all
together
but
now
i
am
going
to
try
to
keep
everything
in
its
own
place
willie
was
now
nine
years
old
his
mother
had
been
poorly
for
some
time
confined
to
her
room
as
she
not
unfrequently
was
in
the
long
cold
winters
it
was
winter
now
and
one
morning
when
all
the
air
was
dark
with
falling
snow
he
was
standing
by
the
parlour
window
looking
out
on
it
and
wondering
whether
the
angels
made
it
up
in
the
sky
for
he
thought
it
might
be
their
sawdust
which
when
they
had
too
much
they
shook
down
to
get
melted
and
put
out
of
the
way
when
tibby
came
into
the
room
very
softly
and
looking
he
thought
very
strange
willie
your
mamma
wants
you
she
said
and
willie
hastened
to
his
mother
room
dark
as
was
the
air
outside
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
dark
the
room
was
and
what
surprised
him
more
was
a
curious
noise
which
he
heard
the
moment
he
entered
it
like
the
noise
of
a
hedgehog
or
some
other
little
creature
of
the
fields
or
woods
but
he
crept
gently
up
to
his
mother
bed
saying
are
you
better
this
morning
mamma
and
she
answered
in
a
feeble
sweet
voice
yes
willie
very
much
better
and
willie
god
has
sent
you
a
little
sister
cried
willie
a
little
sister
did
he
make
her
himself
yes
he
made
her
himself
and
sent
her
to
you
last
night
how
busy
he
must
have
been
lately
said
willie
where
is
she
i
like
to
see
her
is
she
my
very
own
sister
yes
your
very
own
sister
willie
to
love
and
take
care
of
always
where
is
she
go
and
ask
nurse
to
let
you
see
her
then
willie
saw
that
there
was
a
strange
woman
in
the
room
with
something
lying
on
her
lap
he
went
up
to
her
and
she
folded
back
the
corner
of
a
blanket
and
revealed
a
face
no
bigger
than
that
of
the
big
doll
at
the
clergyman
house
but
alive
quite
alive
such
a
pretty
little
face
he
stood
staring
at
it
for
a
while
may
i
kiss
her
nurse
yes
gently
quite
gently
he
kissed
her
half
afraid
he
did
not
know
of
what
her
cheek
was
softer
and
smoother
than
anything
he
had
ever
touched
before
he
sped
back
to
his
mother
too
full
of
delight
to
speak
but
she
was
not
yet
well
enough
to
talk
to
him
and
his
father
coming
in
led
him
again
where
he
began
once
more
to
watch
the
snow
wondering
now
if
it
had
anything
to
do
with
baby
arrival
in
the
afternoon
it
was
found
that
the
lock
of
his
mother
room
not
only
would
not
catch
easily
but
made
a
noise
that
disturbed
her
so
his
father
got
a
screwdriver
and
removed
it
making
as
little
noise
as
he
could
next
he
contrived
a
way
with
a
piece
of
string
for
keeping
the
door
shut
and
as
that
would
not
hold
it
close
enough
hung
a
shawl
over
it
to
keep
the
draught
out
all
which
proceeding
willie
watched
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
and
the
nurse
had
closed
the
door
behind
them
mr
macmichael
set
out
to
take
the
lock
to
the
smithy
and
allowed
willie
to
go
with
him
by
the
time
they
reached
it
the
snow
was
an
inch
deep
on
their
shoulders
on
willie
cap
and
on
his
father
hat
how
red
the
glow
of
the
smith
fire
looked
it
was
a
great
black
cavern
with
a
red
heart
to
it
in
the
midst
of
whiteness
the
smith
was
a
great
powerful
man
with
bare
arms
and
blackened
face
when
they
entered
he
and
two
other
men
were
making
the
axle
of
a
wheel
they
had
a
great
lump
of
iron
on
the
anvil
and
were
knocking
a
big
hole
through
it
not
boring
it
but
knocking
it
through
with
a
big
punch
one
of
the
men
with
a
pair
of
pincers
held
the
punch
steady
in
the
hole
while
the
other
two
struck
the
head
of
it
with
alternate
blows
of
mighty
hammers
called
sledges
each
of
which
it
took
the
strength
of
two
brawny
arms
to
heave
high
above
the
head
with
a
great
round
swing
over
the
shoulder
that
it
might
come
down
with
right
good
force
and
drive
the
punch
through
the
glowing
iron
which
was
i
should
judge
four
inches
thick
all
this
willie
thought
he
could
understand
for
he
knew
that
fire
made
the
hardest
metal
soft
but
what
he
could
at
all
understand
was
this
every
now
and
then
they
stopped
heaving
their
mighty
sledges
the
third
man
took
the
punch
out
of
the
hole
and
the
smith
himself
whose
name
was
willet
and
he
did
with
a
vengeance
when
he
had
anything
on
the
anvil
before
him
caught
up
his
tongs
in
his
hand
then
picked
up
a
little
bit
of
black
coal
with
the
tongs
and
dropped
it
into
the
hole
where
the
punch
had
been
where
it
took
fire
immediately
and
blazed
up
then
in
went
the
punch
again
and
again
the
huge
hammering
commenced
with
such
bangs
and
blows
that
the
smith
was
wise
to
have
no
floor
to
his
smithy
for
they
would
surely
have
knocked
a
hole
in
that
though
they
were
not
able
to
knock
the
anvil
down
halfway
into
the
earth
as
the
giant
smith
in
the
story
did
while
this
was
going
on
mr
macmichael
perceiving
that
the
operation
ought
not
to
be
interrupted
any
more
than
a
surgical
one
stood
quite
still
waiting
and
willie
stood
also
absorbed
in
staring
and
gradually
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
anvil
for
there
were
no
sparks
flying
about
to
make
it
dangerous
to
the
eyes
as
there
would
have
been
if
they
had
been
striking
the
iron
itself
instead
of
the
punch
as
soon
as
the
punch
was
driven
through
and
the
smith
had
dropped
his
and
begun
to
wipe
his
forehead
willie
spoke
mr
willet
he
said
for
he
knew
every
man
of
any
standing
in
the
village
by
name
and
profession
why
did
you
put
bits
of
coal
into
the
hole
you
were
making
i
should
have
thought
it
would
be
in
the
way
rather
than
help
you
so
it
would
my
little
man
answered
willet
with
no
grim
though
grimy
smile
if
it
did
take
fire
and
keep
getting
out
of
the
way
all
the
time
it
kept
up
the
heat
you
see
we
depend
on
the
heat
for
getting
through
and
it
much
less
trouble
to
drop
a
bit
of
coal
or
two
into
the
hole
than
to
take
up
the
big
axle
and
lay
it
in
the
fire
again
not
to
mention
the
time
and
the
quantity
of
coal
it
would
take
to
heat
it
up
afresh
but
such
little
bits
of
coal
could
do
much
said
willie
they
could
do
enough
and
all
that
less
after
that
is
saving
said
the
smith
who
was
one
of
those
men
who
can
not
only
do
a
thing
right
but
give
a
reason
for
it
you
see
i
was
able
to
put
the
little
bits
just
in
the
right
place
i
see
i
see
cried
willie
i
understand
but
papa
do
you
think
mr
willet
is
the
proper
person
to
ask
to
set
your
lock
right
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
said
mr
macmichael
taking
it
out
of
his
greatcoat
pocket
and
unfolding
the
piece
of
paper
in
which
he
had
wrapped
it
why
do
you
make
a
question
of
it
because
look
what
great
big
huge
things
he
does
how
could
those
tremendous
hammers
set
such
a
little
thing
as
that
right
they
would
knock
it
all
to
pieces
do
you
think
you
had
better
take
it
to
the
watchmaker
if
i
did
willie
do
you
know
what
you
would
say
the
moment
you
saw
him
at
work
no
papa
what
should
i
say
you
would
say
you
think
papa
you
had
better
take
it
back
to
the
smith
but
why
should
i
say
that
because
when
you
saw
his
tools
beside
this
lock
you
would
think
the
tools
so
small
and
the
lock
so
huge
that
nothing
could
be
done
between
them
yet
i
daresay
the
watchmaker
could
set
the
lock
all
right
if
he
chose
to
try
do
you
think
so
mr
willet
not
a
doubt
of
it
answered
the
smith
had
we
better
go
to
him
then
well
answered
the
smith
smiling
i
think
perhaps
he
would
ask
you
why
you
had
come
to
me
no
doubt
he
could
do
it
but
i
got
better
tools
for
the
purpose
let
me
look
at
the
lock
i
sure
i
shall
be
able
to
set
it
right
not
with
that
great
big
hammer
then
said
willie
no
i
have
smaller
hammers
than
that
when
do
you
want
it
sir
could
you
manage
to
do
it
at
once
and
let
me
take
it
home
for
a
little
baby
there
just
arrived
you
do
mean
it
said
the
smith
looking
surprised
i
wish
you
joy
sir
and
this
is
the
lock
of
the
room
she
in
continued
the
doctor
and
you
afraid
of
her
getting
out
and
flying
off
again
said
the
smith
i
will
do
it
at
once
there
is
much
wrong
with
it
i
daresay
i
hope
mrs
macmichael
is
doing
well
sir
he
took
the
lock
drew
several
screws
from
it
and
then
forced
it
open
it
nothing
but
the
spring
gone
he
said
as
he
took
out
something
and
threw
it
away
then
he
took
out
several
more
pieces
and
cleaned
them
all
then
he
searched
in
a
box
till
he
found
another
spring
which
he
put
in
instead
of
the
broken
one
after
snipping
off
a
little
bit
with
a
pair
of
pincers
then
he
put
all
the
pieces
in
put
on
the
cover
of
it
gave
something
a
few
taps
with
a
tiny
hammer
replaced
the
screws
and
said
shall
i
come
and
put
it
on
for
you
sir
no
no
i
am
up
to
that
much
said
mr
macmichael
i
can
easily
manage
that
come
willie
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
doing
it
at
once
then
out
they
went
into
the
snowstorm
again
willie
holding
fast
by
his
father
hand
this
is
good
said
his
father
your
mother
will
have
a
better
day
all
and
perhaps
a
longer
sleep
for
it
you
see
how
easy
it
is
to
be
both
useful
and
kind
sometimes
the
smith
did
more
for
your
mother
in
those
few
minutes
than
ten
doctors
could
have
done
think
of
his
great
black
fingers
making
a
little
more
sleep
and
rest
and
warmth
for
her
and
all
in
those
few
minutes
suppose
he
could
have
done
it
said
willie
do
you
think
the
watchmaker
could
that
i
ca
tell
but
i
do
think
it
likely
we
should
most
probably
have
had
to
get
a
new
one
suppose
you
could
get
a
new
one
then
we
should
have
had
to
set
our
wits
to
work
and
contrive
some
other
way
of
fastening
the
door
so
that
mamma
should
take
cold
by
its
being
open
nor
yet
be
disturbed
by
the
noise
of
it
it
would
be
so
nice
to
be
able
to
do
everything
said
willie
so
it
would
but
nobody
can
and
it
just
as
well
for
then
we
should
not
need
so
much
help
from
each
other
and
would
be
too
independent
then
should
a
body
try
to
do
as
many
things
as
he
can
yes
for
there
no
fear
of
ever
being
able
to
do
without
other
people
and
you
would
be
so
often
able
to
help
them
both
the
smith
and
the
watch
maker
could
mend
a
lock
but
neither
of
them
could
do
without
the
other
for
all
that
when
willie
went
to
bed
he
lay
awake
a
long
time
thinking
how
if
the
lock
could
not
have
been
mended
and
there
had
been
no
other
to
be
had
he
could
have
contrived
to
keep
the
door
shut
properly
in
the
morning
however
he
told
his
father
that
he
had
not
thought
of
any
way
that
would
do
for
though
he
could
contrive
to
shut
and
open
the
door
well
enough
he
could
not
think
how
a
person
outside
might
be
able
to
do
it
and
he
thought
the
best
way
if
such
a
difficulty
should
occur
would
be
to
take
the
lock
off
his
door
and
put
it
on
mamma
till
a
better
one
could
be
got
of
this
suggestion
his
father
much
to
satisfaction
entirely
approved
chapter
iv
he
serves
an
apprenticeship
willie
mother
grew
better
and
willie
sister
grew
bigger
and
the
strange
nurse
went
away
and
willie
and
his
mother
and
tibby
with
a
little
occasional
assistance
from
the
doctor
managed
the
baby
amongst
them
considering
that
she
had
been
yet
only
a
short
time
at
school
she
behaved
wonderfully
well
she
never
cried
except
she
was
in
some
trouble
and
even
then
you
could
seldom
have
seen
a
tear
on
her
face
she
did
all
that
was
required
of
her
grew
longer
and
broader
and
heavier
and
was
very
fond
of
a
lighted
candle
the
only
fault
she
had
was
that
she
would
give
willie
quite
so
many
smiles
as
he
wanted
as
to
the
view
she
took
of
affairs
she
seemed
for
a
long
time
to
be
on
the
whole
very
well
satisfied
with
life
and
its
gifts
but
when
at
last
its
troubles
began
to
overtake
her
she
did
not
approve
of
them
at
all
the
first
thing
she
objected
to
was
being
weaned
which
she
evidently
considered
a
very
cruel
and
unnecessary
experience
but
her
father
said
it
must
be
and
her
mother
believing
him
to
know
best
carried
out
his
decree
little
agnes
endured
it
tolerably
well
in
the
daytime
but
in
the
night
protested
lustily
was
indeed
so
outrageously
indignant
that
one
evening
the
following
conversation
took
place
at
the
where
willie
sat
and
heard
it
really
my
dear
said
mrs
macmichael
i
can
not
have
your
rest
disturbed
in
this
way
another
night
you
must
go
to
willie
room
and
let
me
manage
the
little
squalling
thing
myself
why
should
i
take
my
share
of
the
trouble
objected
her
husband
because
you
may
be
called
up
any
moment
and
have
no
more
sleep
till
next
night
and
it
is
not
fair
that
what
sleep
your
work
does
let
you
have
should
be
so
unnecessarily
broken
it
not
as
if
i
could
manage
without
you
but
willie
bed
is
not
big
enough
for
both
of
us
he
objected
then
willie
can
come
and
sleep
with
me
but
willie
wants
his
sleep
as
much
as
i
do
mine
there
no
fear
of
him
he
would
sleep
though
all
the
babies
in
priory
leas
were
crying
in
the
room
would
i
really
thought
willie
feeling
rather
ashamed
of
himself
but
who
will
get
up
and
warm
the
for
you
pursued
his
father
oh
i
can
manage
that
quite
well
could
i
do
that
mamma
said
willie
very
humbly
for
he
thought
of
what
his
mother
had
said
about
his
sleeping
powers
no
my
pet
she
answered
and
he
said
no
more
it
seems
to
me
said
his
father
a
very
clumsy
necessity
i
have
been
thinking
over
it
to
keep
a
fire
in
all
night
only
to
warm
such
a
tiny
drop
of
water
as
she
wants
i
must
say
seems
like
using
a
to
sweep
up
the
crumbs
if
you
would
just
get
a
stone
bottle
fill
it
with
boiling
water
wrap
a
piece
of
flannel
about
it
and
lay
it
anywhere
in
the
bed
it
would
be
quite
hot
enough
even
in
the
morning
to
make
the
milk
as
warm
as
she
ought
to
have
it
if
you
will
go
to
willie
room
and
let
willie
come
and
sleep
with
me
i
will
try
it
she
said
mr
macmichael
consented
and
straightway
willie
was
filled
with
silent
delight
at
the
thought
of
sleeping
with
his
mother
and
the
baby
nor
because
of
that
only
for
he
resolved
within
himself
that
he
would
try
to
get
a
share
in
the
business
of
the
night
why
should
his
mother
have
too
little
sleep
rather
than
himself
they
might
at
least
divide
the
too
little
between
them
so
he
went
to
bed
early
full
of
the
thought
of
waking
up
as
soon
as
agnes
should
begin
to
cry
and
finding
out
what
he
could
do
already
he
had
begun
to
be
useful
in
the
daytime
and
had
twice
put
her
to
sleep
when
both
his
mother
and
tibby
had
failed
and
although
he
quite
understood
that
in
all
probability
he
would
not
have
succeeded
if
they
had
tried
first
yet
it
had
been
some
relief
to
them
and
they
had
confessed
it
but
when
he
woke
there
lay
his
mother
and
his
sister
both
sound
asleep
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
blind
he
heard
tibby
about
the
house
and
in
short
it
was
time
to
get
up
at
breakfast
his
father
said
to
him
well
willie
how
did
agnes
behave
herself
last
night
so
well
answered
willie
she
never
cried
once
o
willie
said
his
mother
laughing
she
screamed
for
a
whole
hour
and
was
so
hungry
after
it
that
she
emptied
her
bottle
without
stopping
once
you
were
sound
asleep
all
the
time
and
never
stirred
willie
was
so
much
ashamed
of
himself
although
he
was
in
the
least
to
blame
that
he
could
hardly
keep
from
crying
he
did
not
say
another
word
except
when
he
was
spoken
to
all
through
breakfast
and
his
father
and
mother
were
puzzled
to
think
what
could
be
the
matter
with
him
he
went
about
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
moodily
thinking
then
for
advice
betook
himself
to
mrs
wilson
who
gave
him
her
full
attention
and
suggested
several
things
none
of
which
however
seemed
to
him
likely
to
succeed
if
i
could
but
go
to
bed
after
mamma
was
asleep
he
said
i
could
tie
a
string
to
my
hair
and
then
slip
a
loop
at
the
other
end
over
wrist
so
that
when
she
sat
up
to
attend
to
agnes
she
would
pull
my
hair
and
wake
me
would
she
wonder
what
it
was
when
she
felt
it
pulling
he
had
to
go
home
without
any
help
from
mrs
wilson
all
the
way
he
kept
thinking
with
himself
something
after
this
fashion
mamma
wo
wake
me
and
agnes
ca
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
everybody
else
will
be
just
as
fast
asleep
as
i
shall
be
let
me
see
who
there
that
awake
all
night
there
the
cat
i
think
she
is
but
then
she
would
know
when
to
wake
me
and
even
if
i
could
teach
her
to
wake
me
the
moment
agnes
cried
i
do
think
she
would
be
a
nice
one
to
do
it
for
if
i
did
come
awake
with
a
pat
of
her
velvety
she
might
turn
out
the
points
of
the
pins
in
them
and
scratch
me
awake
there
the
clock
it
always
awake
but
it
tell
you
the
time
till
you
go
and
ask
it
i
think
it
might
be
made
to
wind
up
a
string
that
should
pull
me
when
the
right
time
came
but
i
do
think
i
could
teach
it
and
when
it
came
to
the
pull
the
pull
might
stop
the
clock
and
what
would
papa
say
then
they
tell
me
the
owls
are
up
all
night
but
they
no
good
i
certain
i
do
see
what
i
to
do
i
wonder
if
god
would
wake
me
if
i
were
to
ask
him
i
do
know
whether
willie
did
or
did
not
ask
god
to
wake
him
i
did
not
inquire
for
what
goes
on
of
that
kind
it
is
better
not
to
talk
much
about
what
i
do
know
is
that
he
fell
asleep
with
his
head
and
heart
full
of
desire
to
wake
and
help
his
mother
and
that
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
did
wake
up
suddenly
and
there
was
little
agnes
screaming
with
all
her
might
he
sat
up
in
bed
instantly
what
the
matter
willie
said
his
mother
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
baby
crying
said
willie
never
you
mind
i
manage
her
do
you
know
mamma
i
think
i
was
waked
up
just
in
time
to
help
you
i
take
her
from
you
and
perhaps
she
will
take
her
drink
from
me
nonsense
willie
lie
down
my
pet
but
i
been
thinking
about
it
mamma
do
you
remember
yesterday
agnes
would
not
take
her
bottle
from
you
and
screamed
and
screamed
but
when
tibby
took
her
she
gave
in
and
drank
it
all
perhaps
she
would
do
the
same
with
me
illustration
willie
sat
down
with
the
baby
on
his
knees
and
she
stopped
crying
as
he
spoke
he
slipped
out
of
bed
and
held
out
his
arms
to
take
the
baby
the
light
was
already
coming
in
just
a
little
through
the
blind
for
it
was
summer
he
heard
a
cow
lowing
in
the
fields
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
he
wondered
whether
her
baby
had
woke
her
the
next
moment
he
had
little
agnes
in
his
arms
for
his
mother
thought
he
might
as
well
try
seeing
he
was
awake
do
take
care
and
do
let
her
fall
willie
that
i
will
mamma
i
got
her
tight
now
give
me
the
bottle
please
i
have
got
it
ready
yet
for
you
woke
the
minute
she
began
to
cry
so
willie
walked
about
the
room
with
agnes
till
his
mother
had
got
her
bottle
filled
with
nice
warm
and
just
a
little
sugar
when
she
gave
it
to
him
he
sat
down
with
the
baby
on
his
knees
and
to
his
great
delight
and
the
satisfaction
of
his
mother
as
well
she
stopped
crying
and
began
to
drink
the
why
you
a
born
nurse
willie
said
his
mother
but
the
moment
the
baby
heard
her
mother
voice
she
forsook
the
bottle
and
began
to
scream
wanting
to
go
to
her
o
mamma
you
must
speak
please
for
of
course
she
likes
you
better
than
the
bottle
and
when
you
speak
that
reminds
her
of
you
it
was
just
the
same
with
tibby
yesterday
or
if
you
must
speak
speak
with
some
other
sound
and
not
in
your
own
soft
sweet
way
a
few
moments
after
willie
was
so
startled
by
a
gruff
voice
in
the
room
that
he
nearly
dropped
the
bottle
but
it
was
only
his
mother
following
his
directions
the
plan
was
quite
successful
for
the
baby
had
not
a
suspicion
that
the
voice
was
her
mother
paid
no
heed
to
it
and
attended
only
to
her
bottle
mr
macmichael
who
had
been
in
the
country
was
creeping
up
the
stair
to
his
room
fearful
of
disturbing
his
wife
when
what
should
he
hear
but
a
man
voice
as
he
supposed
and
what
should
he
think
but
that
robbers
had
broken
in
of
course
he
went
to
his
wife
room
first
there
he
heard
the
voice
plainly
enough
through
the
door
but
when
he
opened
it
he
could
see
no
one
except
willie
feeding
the
baby
on
an
ottoman
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
when
his
wife
had
explained
what
and
why
it
was
they
both
laughed
heartily
over
willie
suggestion
for
leaving
the
imagination
of
little
agnes
in
repose
and
henceforth
he
was
installed
as
so
long
as
the
process
of
weaning
should
last
and
very
proud
of
his
promotion
he
was
he
slept
as
sound
as
ever
for
he
had
no
anxiety
about
waking
his
mother
always
woke
him
the
instant
agnes
began
to
cry
willie
she
would
say
willie
here
your
baby
wanting
you
and
up
willie
would
start
sometimes
before
he
was
able
to
open
his
eyes
for
little
boys
eyelids
are
occasionally
obstinate
and
once
he
jumped
out
of
bed
crying
where
is
she
mamma
i
lost
her
for
he
had
been
dreaming
about
her
you
may
be
sure
his
mamma
let
him
have
a
long
sleep
in
the
morning
always
to
make
up
for
being
disturbed
in
the
night
agnes
throve
well
notwithstanding
the
weaning
she
soon
got
reconciled
to
the
bottle
and
then
willie
slept
in
peace
chapter
he
goes
to
learn
a
trade
time
passed
and
willie
grew
have
my
readers
ever
thought
what
is
meant
by
growing
it
is
far
from
meaning
only
that
you
get
bigger
and
stronger
it
means
that
you
become
able
both
to
understand
and
to
wonder
at
more
of
the
things
about
you
there
are
people
who
the
more
they
understand
wonder
the
less
but
such
are
not
growing
straight
they
are
growing
crooked
there
are
two
ways
of
growing
you
may
be
growing
up
or
you
may
be
growing
down
and
if
you
are
doing
both
at
once
then
you
are
growing
crooked
there
are
people
who
are
growing
up
in
understanding
but
down
in
goodness
it
is
a
beautiful
fact
however
that
you
ca
grow
up
in
goodness
and
down
in
understanding
while
the
great
probability
is
that
if
you
are
not
growing
better
you
will
by
and
by
begin
to
grow
stupid
those
who
are
growing
the
right
way
the
more
they
understand
the
more
they
wonder
and
the
more
they
learn
to
do
the
more
they
want
to
do
willie
was
a
boy
of
this
kind
i
care
to
write
about
boys
and
girls
or
men
and
women
who
are
not
growing
the
right
way
they
are
not
interesting
enough
to
write
about
but
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
grow
agnes
grew
as
well
and
the
more
willie
grew
capable
of
helping
her
the
more
he
found
agnes
required
of
him
it
was
a
long
time
however
before
he
knew
how
much
he
was
obliged
to
agnes
for
requiring
so
much
of
him
she
grew
and
grew
until
she
was
capable
of
a
doll
when
of
course
a
doll
was
given
her
not
a
new
one
just
bought
but
a
most
respectable
old
doll
a
big
one
that
had
been
her
mother
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
which
she
had
been
wise
enough
to
put
in
her
trunk
before
she
left
her
mother
house
to
go
home
with
mr
macmichael
she
made
some
new
clothes
for
it
now
and
tibby
made
a
cloak
and
bonnet
for
her
to
wear
when
she
went
out
of
doors
but
it
struck
willie
that
her
shoes
which
were
only
of
cloth
were
very
unfit
for
walking
and
he
thought
that
in
a
doctor
family
it
was
something
quite
amazing
that
while
head
and
shoulders
were
properly
looked
after
the
feet
should
remain
utterly
neglected
it
was
clear
that
must
be
his
part
in
the
affair
it
could
not
be
anybody
else
for
in
that
case
some
one
else
would
have
attended
to
it
he
must
see
about
it
i
think
i
have
said
before
that
willie
knew
almost
everybody
in
the
village
and
i
might
have
added
that
everybody
without
exception
knew
him
he
was
a
favourite
first
of
all
because
his
father
was
much
loved
and
trusted
next
because
his
mother
spoke
as
kindly
to
her
poor
patients
as
to
the
richer
ones
and
last
because
he
himself
spoke
to
everybody
with
proper
respect
some
of
the
people
however
he
knew
of
course
better
than
others
of
these
mrs
wilson
we
know
was
one
but
i
believe
i
also
mentioned
that
in
the
house
in
which
she
lived
there
were
other
poor
people
in
the
room
opposite
to
hers
on
the
lived
and
worked
a
shoemaker
a
man
who
had
neither
wife
nor
child
nor
so
far
as
people
knew
any
near
relative
at
all
he
was
far
from
being
in
good
health
and
although
he
worked
from
morning
to
night
had
a
constant
pain
in
his
back
which
was
rather
crooked
having
indeed
a
little
hump
on
it
if
his
temper
was
not
always
of
the
best
i
wonder
what
cleverest
of
watches
or
would
go
as
well
as
he
did
with
such
a
twist
in
its
back
to
see
him
seated
on
his
low
stool
in
which
by
the
way
as
if
it
had
not
been
low
enough
he
sat
in
a
hole
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
the
softness
and
spring
of
the
leather
with
his
head
and
body
bent
forward
over
his
lapstone
or
his
last
and
his
right
hand
with
the
quick
hammer
hammering
up
and
down
on
a
piece
of
or
with
both
his
hands
now
meeting
as
if
for
a
little
friendly
chat
about
something
small
and
then
suddenly
starting
asunder
as
if
in
astonished
anger
with
a
portentous
hiss
you
might
have
taken
him
for
an
automaton
moved
by
springs
and
imitating
human
actions
in
a
very
wonderful
manner
so
regular
and
were
his
motions
and
so
little
did
he
seem
to
think
about
what
he
was
at
a
little
passing
attention
a
hint
now
and
then
from
his
head
was
sufficient
to
keep
his
hands
right
for
they
were
so
used
to
their
work
and
had
been
so
well
taught
by
his
head
that
they
could
pretty
nearly
have
made
a
pair
of
shoes
of
themselves
so
that
the
shoemaking
trade
is
one
that
admits
of
a
great
deal
of
thought
going
on
in
the
head
that
hangs
over
the
work
like
a
sun
over
the
earth
ripening
its
harvest
shoemakers
have
distinguished
themselves
both
in
poetry
and
in
prose
and
if
hector
macallaster
had
done
so
in
neither
he
could
yet
think
and
that
is
what
some
people
who
write
both
poetry
and
prose
can
not
do
but
it
is
of
infinitely
more
importance
to
be
able
to
think
well
than
merely
to
write
ever
so
well
and
besides
to
think
well
is
what
everybody
ought
to
be
or
to
become
able
to
do
hector
had
odd
ways
of
looking
at
things
but
i
need
not
say
more
about
that
for
it
will
soon
be
plain
enough
ever
since
the
illness
from
which
he
had
risen
with
a
weak
spine
and
brain
and
a
quiet
heart
he
had
shown
himself
not
merely
a
good
sort
of
man
for
such
he
had
always
been
but
a
religious
man
not
by
saying
much
for
he
was
modest
even
to
shyness
with
grown
people
but
by
the
solemnity
of
his
look
when
a
great
word
was
spoken
by
his
unblamable
behaviour
and
by
the
readiness
with
which
he
would
lend
or
give
of
his
small
earnings
to
his
poor
neighbours
the
only
thing
of
which
anybody
could
complain
was
his
temper
but
it
showed
itself
only
occasionally
and
almost
everybody
made
excuse
for
it
on
the
ground
of
his
bodily
ailments
he
gave
it
no
quarter
himself
however
he
said
once
to
the
clergyman
to
whom
he
had
been
lamenting
the
trouble
he
had
with
it
and
who
had
sought
to
comfort
him
by
saying
that
it
was
caused
by
the
weakness
of
his
health
no
sir
excuse
me
nobody
knows
how
much
i
am
indebted
to
my
crooked
back
if
it
were
for
that
i
might
have
a
bad
temper
and
never
know
it
but
that
drives
it
out
of
its
hole
and
when
i
see
the
ugly
head
of
it
i
know
it
there
and
try
once
more
to
starve
it
to
death
but
oh
dear
it
such
a
creature
to
burrow
when
i
think
i
built
it
in
all
round
out
comes
its
head
again
at
a
place
where
i
never
looked
to
see
it
and
it
all
to
do
over
again
you
will
understand
by
this
already
that
the
shoemaker
thought
after
his
own
fashion
which
is
the
way
everybody
who
can
think
does
think
what
he
thought
about
his
trade
and
some
other
things
we
shall
see
by
and
by
when
willie
entered
his
room
he
greeted
him
with
a
very
friendly
nod
for
not
only
was
he
fond
of
children
but
he
had
a
special
favour
for
willie
chiefly
because
he
considered
himself
greatly
indebted
to
him
for
something
he
had
said
to
mrs
wilson
and
which
had
given
him
a
good
deal
to
think
about
for
mrs
wilson
often
had
a
chat
with
hector
and
then
she
would
not
unfrequently
talk
about
willie
of
whose
friendship
she
was
proud
she
had
told
him
of
the
strange
question
he
had
put
to
her
as
to
whether
god
worked
and
the
shoemaker
thinking
over
it
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
willie
father
and
it
had
been
a
great
comfort
and
help
to
him
what
can
i
do
for
you
willie
he
said
for
in
that
part
of
the
country
they
do
not
say
and
you
look
he
added
if
you
wanted
something
i
want
you
to
teach
me
please
answered
willie
to
teach
you
what
asked
hector
to
make
shoes
please
answered
willie
ah
but
do
you
think
that
would
be
prudent
of
me
do
you
see
if
i
were
to
teach
you
to
make
shoes
people
would
be
coming
to
you
to
make
their
shoes
for
them
and
what
would
become
of
me
then
but
i
only
want
to
make
shoes
for
aggy
doll
she
ought
to
go
without
shoes
in
this
weather
you
know
certainly
not
well
if
you
will
bring
me
the
doll
i
will
take
her
measure
and
make
her
a
pair
but
i
do
think
papa
could
afford
to
pay
for
shoes
for
a
doll
as
well
as
for
all
of
us
you
see
though
it
would
be
better
it
not
necessary
that
a
doll
should
have
strong
shoes
she
has
shoes
good
enough
for
indoors
and
she
need
walk
in
the
wet
do
you
think
so
yourself
hector
but
returned
hector
i
shall
be
happy
to
make
agnes
a
present
of
a
pair
of
shoes
for
her
doll
i
should
think
of
charging
your
papa
for
that
he
is
far
too
good
a
man
to
be
made
to
pay
for
everything
but
objected
willie
to
let
you
make
them
for
nothing
would
be
as
bad
as
to
make
papa
pay
for
them
when
they
are
not
necessary
please
you
must
let
me
make
them
for
aggy
besides
she
not
old
enough
yet
even
to
say
thank
you
for
them
then
she
wo
be
old
enough
to
say
thank
you
to
you
either
said
hector
who
all
this
time
had
been
losing
no
moment
from
his
work
but
was
stitching
away
with
a
bore
and
a
twiddle
and
a
hiss
at
the
sole
of
a
huge
boot
ah
but
you
see
she
my
own
so
it
does
matter
if
i
were
writing
a
big
book
instead
of
a
little
one
i
should
be
tempted
to
say
not
only
that
this
set
hector
a
thinking
but
what
it
made
him
think
as
well
instead
of
replying
however
he
laid
down
his
boot
rose
and
first
taking
from
a
shelf
a
whole
skin
of
and
next
a
low
chair
from
a
corner
of
the
room
he
set
the
latter
near
his
own
seat
opposite
the
window
sit
down
there
then
willie
he
said
adding
as
he
handed
him
the
there
your
leather
and
my
tools
are
at
your
service
make
your
shoes
and
welcome
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
company
having
thus
spoken
he
sat
down
again
caught
up
his
boot
hurriedly
and
began
stitching
away
as
if
for
bare
life
willie
took
the
on
his
lap
somewhat
bewildered
if
he
had
been
asked
to
cut
out
a
pair
of
boots
for
the
ogre
there
would
have
seemed
to
his
eyes
enough
of
leather
for
them
in
that
one
skin
but
how
ever
was
he
to
find
two
pieces
small
enough
for
shoes
in
such
an
ocean
of
leather
he
began
to
turn
it
round
and
round
looking
at
it
all
along
the
edge
while
hector
was
casting
sidelong
glances
at
him
in
the
midst
of
his
busyness
with
a
curiosity
on
his
face
which
his
desire
to
conceal
it
caused
to
look
grim
instead
of
amused
willie
although
he
had
never
yet
considered
how
shoes
are
made
had
seen
at
once
that
nothing
could
be
done
until
he
had
got
the
command
of
a
manageable
bit
of
leather
he
found
too
much
only
a
shade
better
than
too
little
and
he
saw
that
it
would
be
wise
to
cut
a
piece
out
anywhere
for
that
might
spoil
what
would
serve
for
a
large
pair
of
shoes
or
even
boots
therefore
he
kept
turning
the
skin
round
until
he
came
to
a
small
projecting
piece
this
he
contemplated
for
some
time
trying
to
recall
the
size
of
dolly
feet
and
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
it
would
not
be
large
enough
for
one
or
even
for
both
shoes
a
smile
passed
over
hector
face
a
smile
of
satisfaction
that
it
he
said
at
last
i
think
you
do
that
the
first
thing
to
consider
your
stuff
and
see
how
much
you
can
make
of
it
waste
is
a
thing
that
no
good
shoemaker
ever
yet
could
endure
it
bad
in
itself
and
so
unworkmanlike
yes
i
think
that
corner
will
do
shall
i
cut
it
off
for
you
no
thank
you
not
yet
please
i
think
i
must
go
and
look
at
her
feet
for
i
ca
recollect
how
big
they
are
i
just
run
home
and
look
do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
carry
the
exact
size
in
your
head
and
bring
it
back
with
you
yes
i
think
i
shall
i
do
i
never
could
trust
myself
so
far
as
that
nearly
you
might
be
pretty
nigh
it
one
way
and
all
wrong
another
for
you
have
to
consider
length
and
breadth
and
roundabout
i
will
tell
you
the
best
way
for
to
do
set
the
doll
standing
on
a
bit
of
paper
and
draw
a
pencil
all
round
her
foot
with
the
point
close
to
it
on
the
paper
both
feet
will
be
better
for
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
they
must
be
of
the
same
size
that
will
give
you
the
size
of
the
sole
then
take
a
strip
of
paper
and
see
how
long
a
piece
it
takes
to
go
round
the
thickest
part
of
the
foot
and
cut
it
off
to
that
length
that
will
be
sufficient
measurement
for
a
doll
shoe
for
even
if
it
should
not
fit
exactly
she
wo
mind
either
being
pinched
a
little
or
having
to
walk
a
little
loose
willie
got
up
at
once
to
go
and
do
as
hector
had
told
him
but
hector
was
not
willing
to
part
with
him
so
soon
for
it
was
not
often
he
had
anybody
to
talk
to
while
he
went
on
with
his
work
therefore
he
said
but
do
you
think
willie
before
you
set
about
it
you
had
better
see
how
i
do
it
would
be
a
pity
to
spend
your
labour
in
finding
out
for
yourself
what
shoemakers
have
known
for
hundreds
of
years
and
which
you
could
learn
so
easily
by
letting
me
show
you
thank
you
said
willie
sitting
down
again
i
should
like
that
very
much
i
will
sit
and
look
at
you
i
know
what
you
are
doing
you
are
fastening
on
the
sole
of
a
boot
yes
do
you
see
how
it
done
i
not
sure
i
do
see
yet
quite
of
course
i
see
you
are
sewing
the
one
to
the
other
i
often
wondered
how
you
could
manage
with
small
shoes
like
mine
to
get
in
your
hand
to
pull
the
needle
through
but
i
see
you
do
use
a
needle
and
i
see
that
you
are
sewing
it
all
on
the
outside
of
the
boot
and
do
put
your
hand
inside
at
all
i
ca
get
to
understand
it
you
will
in
a
minute
you
see
how
all
round
the
edge
of
the
upper
as
we
call
it
i
have
sewn
on
a
strong
narrow
strip
so
that
one
edge
of
the
strip
sticks
out
all
round
while
the
other
is
inside
to
the
edge
that
sticks
out
i
sew
on
the
sole
drawing
my
threads
so
tight
that
when
i
pare
the
edges
off
smooth
it
will
look
like
one
piece
and
puzzle
anybody
who
did
not
know
how
it
was
done
i
think
i
understand
but
how
do
you
get
your
thread
so
sharp
and
stiff
as
to
go
through
the
holes
you
make
i
find
it
hard
enough
sometimes
to
get
a
thread
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
for
though
the
thread
is
ever
so
much
smaller
than
yours
i
have
to
sharpen
and
sharpen
it
often
before
i
can
get
it
through
but
yours
though
it
is
so
thick
keeps
so
sharp
that
it
goes
through
the
holes
at
once
two
threads
at
once
one
from
each
side
ah
but
i
do
sharpen
my
thread
i
put
a
point
upon
it
does
that
mean
the
same
thing
well
it
may
generally
but
do
mean
the
same
thing
by
it
look
here
i
see
cried
willie
there
is
a
long
bit
of
something
else
not
thread
upon
it
what
is
it
it
looks
like
a
hair
only
thicker
and
it
is
so
sharp
at
the
point
ca
you
guess
no
i
ca
then
i
will
tell
you
it
is
a
bristle
out
of
a
hog
back
i
do
know
what
a
shoemaker
would
do
without
them
look
here
a
little
bunch
of
them
that
a
very
clever
use
to
put
them
to
said
willie
do
you
go
and
pluck
them
out
of
the
pigs
no
we
buy
them
at
the
shop
we
want
a
good
many
for
they
wear
out
they
get
too
soft
and
though
they
do
break
right
off
they
double
up
in
places
so
that
they
wo
go
through
how
do
you
fasten
them
to
the
thread
look
here
said
hector
he
took
several
strands
of
thread
together
and
drew
them
through
and
through
a
piece
of
cobbler
wax
then
took
a
bristle
and
put
it
in
at
the
end
cunningly
in
a
way
willie
could
quite
follow
and
then
rolled
and
rolled
threads
and
all
over
and
over
between
his
hand
and
his
leather
apron
till
it
seemed
like
a
single
cord
there
you
see
is
my
needle
and
thread
all
in
one
and
what
is
the
good
of
rubbing
it
so
much
with
the
cobbler
wax
there
are
several
good
reasons
for
doing
that
in
the
first
place
it
makes
all
the
threads
into
one
by
sticking
them
together
next
it
would
be
worn
out
before
i
had
drawn
it
many
times
through
but
for
the
wax
which
keeps
the
rubbing
from
wearing
it
the
wax
also
protects
it
afterwards
and
keeps
the
wet
from
rotting
it
the
waxed
thread
fills
the
hole
better
too
and
what
is
of
as
much
consequence
as
anything
it
sticks
so
that
the
last
stitch
does
slacken
before
the
next
comes
but
holds
so
tight
that
although
the
leather
is
very
springy
it
can
not
make
it
slip
the
two
pieces
are
thus
got
so
close
together
that
they
are
like
one
piece
as
you
will
see
when
i
pare
the
joined
edges
i
should
tire
my
reader
if
i
were
to
recount
all
the
professional
talk
that
followed
for
although
willie
found
it
most
interesting
and
began
to
feel
as
if
he
should
soon
be
able
to
make
a
shoe
himself
it
is
a
very
different
thing
merely
to
read
about
it
the
man
voice
not
in
your
ears
and
the
work
not
going
on
before
your
eyes
but
the
shoemaker
cared
for
other
things
besides
shoemaking
and
after
a
while
he
happened
to
make
a
remark
which
led
to
the
following
question
from
willie
do
you
understand
astronomy
hector
no
it
not
my
business
you
see
willie
but
you
just
been
telling
me
so
much
about
the
moon
and
the
way
she
keeps
turning
her
face
always
to
us
in
the
politest
manner
as
you
said
i
got
it
all
out
of
mr
dick
book
i
do
understand
it
i
do
know
why
she
does
so
i
know
a
few
things
that
are
not
my
business
just
as
you
know
a
little
about
shoemaking
that
not
being
your
business
but
i
do
understand
them
for
all
that
whose
business
is
astronomy
then
well
answered
hector
a
little
puzzled
i
do
see
how
it
can
well
be
anybody
business
but
god
for
i
sure
no
one
else
can
lay
a
hand
to
it
and
what
your
business
hector
asked
willie
in
a
mood
some
readers
may
perhaps
think
this
a
stupid
question
and
perhaps
so
it
was
but
willie
was
not
therefore
stupid
people
sometimes
stupid
because
they
have
more
things
to
think
about
than
they
can
well
manage
while
those
who
think
only
about
one
or
two
things
may
on
the
contrary
clever
when
just
those
one
or
two
things
happen
to
be
talked
about
what
is
my
business
willie
why
to
keep
people
out
of
the
dirt
of
course
how
asked
willie
again
by
making
and
mending
their
shoes
mr
dick
now
when
he
goes
out
to
look
at
the
stars
through
his
telescope
might
get
his
death
of
cold
if
his
shoemaker
did
not
know
his
business
of
the
general
business
it
a
part
god
keeps
to
himself
to
see
that
the
stars
go
all
right
and
that
the
sun
rises
and
sets
at
the
proper
times
for
the
time
not
the
same
any
two
mornings
running
you
see
and
he
might
make
a
mistake
if
he
was
looked
after
and
that
would
be
serious
but
i
told
you
i
understand
about
astronomy
because
it
not
my
business
i
set
to
keep
folk
feet
off
the
cold
and
wet
earth
and
stones
and
broken
glass
for
however
much
a
man
may
be
an
astronomer
and
look
up
at
the
sky
he
must
touch
the
earth
with
some
part
of
him
and
generally
does
so
with
his
feet
and
god
sets
you
to
do
it
hector
yes
it
the
way
he
looks
after
people
feet
he
got
to
look
after
everything
you
know
or
everything
would
go
wrong
so
he
gives
me
the
leather
and
the
tools
and
the
hands
and
i
must
say
the
head
for
it
wants
no
little
head
to
make
a
shoe
to
measure
and
it
is
as
if
he
said
to
me
you
make
shoes
while
i
keep
the
stars
right
is
it
a
fine
thing
to
have
a
hand
in
the
general
business
and
hector
looked
up
with
shining
eyes
in
the
face
of
the
little
boy
while
he
pulled
at
his
as
if
he
would
make
the
boot
strong
enough
to
keep
out
evil
spirits
i
think
it
a
fine
thing
to
have
to
make
nice
new
shoes
said
willie
but
i
do
think
i
should
like
to
mend
them
when
they
are
soppy
and
muddy
and
out
of
shape
if
you
would
take
your
share
in
the
general
business
you
must
be
particular
it
wo
do
to
be
above
your
business
as
they
say
for
my
part
i
would
say
your
business
there
those
boots
in
the
corner
now
they
belong
to
your
papa
and
they
come
next
do
you
think
it
an
honour
to
keep
the
feet
of
such
a
good
man
dry
and
warm
as
he
goes
about
from
morning
to
night
comforting
people
do
you
think
it
an
honour
to
mend
boots
for
even
if
they
should
be
dirty
oh
yes
for
said
willie
as
if
his
papa
must
be
an
exception
to
any
rule
well
resumed
hector
look
at
these
great
i
shall
have
to
fill
the
soles
of
them
full
of
hobnails
presently
they
belong
to
the
best
ploughman
in
the
parish
john
turnbull
do
you
think
it
an
honour
to
mend
boots
for
a
man
who
makes
the
best
bed
for
the
corn
to
die
in
i
thought
it
was
to
grow
in
said
willie
all
the
same
returned
hector
when
it
dies
it
grows
and
not
till
then
as
you
will
read
in
the
new
testament
is
it
an
honour
i
say
to
mend
boots
for
john
turnbull
oh
yes
for
john
turnbull
i
know
john
said
willie
as
if
it
made
any
difference
to
his
merit
whether
willie
knew
him
or
not
and
there
hector
went
on
lies
a
pair
of
slippers
that
want
patching
they
belong
to
william
webster
the
weaver
round
the
corner
they
very
much
down
at
heel
too
but
is
it
an
honour
to
patch
or
set
up
slippers
for
a
man
who
keeps
his
neighbours
in
fine
linen
all
the
days
of
their
lives
yes
yes
i
know
william
it
must
be
nice
to
do
anything
for
william
webster
suppose
you
did
know
him
would
that
make
any
difference
no
said
willie
after
thinking
a
little
other
people
would
know
him
if
i
did
yes
and
if
nobody
knew
him
god
would
know
him
and
anybody
god
has
thought
worth
making
it
an
honour
to
do
anything
for
believe
me
willie
to
have
to
keep
people
feet
dry
and
warm
is
a
very
important
appointment
your
own
shoes
are
very
good
hector
said
willie
who
had
been
casting
glances
from
time
to
time
at
his
companion
feet
which
were
shod
in
a
manner
that
to
say
the
least
of
it
would
have
prejudiced
no
one
in
favour
of
his
handiwork
is
it
an
honour
to
make
shoes
for
yourself
hector
there
ca
be
much
honour
in
doing
anything
for
yourself
replied
hector
so
far
as
i
can
see
i
confess
my
shoes
are
hardly
decent
but
then
i
can
make
myself
a
pair
at
any
time
and
indeed
i
been
thinking
i
would
for
the
last
three
months
as
soon
as
a
slack
time
came
but
i
been
far
too
busy
as
yet
and
as
i
do
go
out
much
till
after
it
dusk
nobody
sees
them
but
if
you
should
get
your
feet
wet
and
catch
cold
ah
that
might
be
the
death
of
me
said
hector
i
really
must
make
myself
a
pair
well
now
let
me
see
as
soon
as
i
have
mended
those
two
pairs
i
can
do
them
all
i
will
begin
and
i
tell
you
what
he
added
after
a
thoughtful
pause
if
you
come
to
me
the
day
after
i
will
take
that
skin
and
cut
out
a
pair
of
shoes
for
myself
and
you
shall
see
how
i
do
it
and
everything
about
the
making
of
them
yes
you
shall
do
some
part
of
them
yourself
and
that
shall
be
your
first
lesson
in
shoemaking
but
dolly
shoes
suggested
willie
dolly
can
wait
a
bit
she
wo
take
death
of
cold
from
wet
feet
and
let
me
tell
you
it
is
harder
to
make
a
small
pair
well
than
a
large
pair
you
will
do
dolly
ever
so
much
better
after
you
know
how
to
make
a
pair
for
me
chapter
vi
how
willie
learned
to
read
before
he
knew
his
letters
the
next
day
his
thoughts
having
nothing
particular
to
engage
them
kept
brooding
over
two
things
these
two
things
came
together
all
at
once
and
a
resolution
was
the
consequence
i
shall
soon
explain
what
i
mean
the
one
thing
was
that
hector
had
shown
considerable
surprise
when
he
found
that
willie
could
not
read
now
willie
was
not
in
the
least
ashamed
that
he
could
not
read
why
should
he
be
it
was
nowhere
written
in
the
catechism
he
had
learnt
that
it
was
his
duty
to
be
able
to
read
and
if
the
catechism
had
merely
forgotten
to
mention
it
his
father
and
mother
would
have
told
him
neither
was
it
a
duty
he
ought
to
have
known
of
himself
for
then
he
would
have
known
it
so
why
should
he
be
ashamed
people
are
often
ashamed
of
what
they
need
not
be
ashamed
of
again
they
are
often
not
at
all
ashamed
of
what
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
and
will
turn
up
their
faces
to
the
sun
when
they
ought
to
hide
them
in
the
dust
if
for
instance
willie
had
ever
put
on
a
sulky
face
when
his
mother
asked
him
to
hold
the
baby
for
her
that
would
have
been
a
thing
for
shame
of
which
the
skin
of
his
face
might
well
try
to
burn
itself
off
but
not
to
be
able
to
read
before
he
had
even
been
made
to
think
about
it
was
not
at
all
a
thing
to
be
ashamed
of
it
would
have
been
more
of
a
shame
to
be
ashamed
now
that
it
had
been
put
into
his
head
however
to
think
what
a
good
thing
reading
was
all
this
would
apply
no
longer
it
was
a
very
different
thing
now
the
other
subject
which
occupied
his
thoughts
was
this
everybody
was
so
kind
to
him
so
ready
to
do
things
for
him
and
what
was
of
far
more
consequence
to
teach
him
to
do
them
himself
while
he
so
far
as
he
could
think
did
nothing
for
anybody
that
could
not
be
right
it
not
be
for
it
was
not
reasonable
not
to
mention
his
father
and
mother
there
was
mrs
wilson
who
had
taught
him
to
knit
and
even
given
him
a
few
lessons
in
spinning
though
that
had
not
come
to
much
and
here
was
hector
macallaster
going
to
teach
him
to
make
shoes
and
not
one
thing
that
he
could
think
of
was
he
capable
of
doing
in
return
this
must
be
looked
into
for
things
could
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
like
that
all
at
once
it
struck
him
that
hector
had
said
with
some
regret
in
his
voice
that
though
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
he
had
very
little
time
to
read
also
that
although
he
could
see
well
enough
by
candlelight
to
work
at
his
trade
he
could
not
see
well
enough
to
read
what
a
fine
thing
it
would
be
to
learn
to
read
to
hector
it
would
be
such
fun
to
surprise
him
too
by
all
at
once
reading
him
something
the
sun
was
not
at
his
full
height
when
willie
received
this
illumination
before
the
sun
went
down
he
knew
and
could
read
at
sight
at
least
a
dozen
words
for
the
moment
he
saw
that
he
ought
to
learn
to
read
he
ran
to
his
mother
and
asked
her
to
teach
him
she
was
delighted
for
she
had
begun
to
be
a
little
doubtful
whether
his
father
plan
of
leaving
him
alone
till
he
wanted
to
learn
was
the
right
one
but
at
that
precise
moment
she
was
too
busy
with
something
that
must
be
done
for
his
father
to
lay
it
down
and
begin
teaching
him
his
letters
willie
was
so
eager
to
learn
however
that
he
could
not
rest
without
doing
something
towards
it
he
bethought
himself
a
little
then
ran
and
got
dr
watts
hymns
for
children
he
knew
how
doth
the
little
busy
bee
so
well
as
to
be
able
to
repeat
it
without
a
mistake
for
his
mother
had
taught
it
him
and
he
had
understood
it
you
see
he
was
not
like
a
child
of
five
taught
to
repeat
by
rote
lines
which
could
give
him
no
notions
but
mistaken
ones
besides
he
had
a
good
knowledge
of
words
and
could
use
them
well
in
talk
although
he
could
not
read
and
it
is
a
great
thing
if
a
child
can
talk
well
before
he
begins
to
learn
to
read
he
opened
the
little
book
at
the
busy
bee
and
knowing
already
enough
to
be
able
to
divide
the
words
the
one
from
the
other
he
said
to
himself
the
first
word
must
be
there
it
is
with
a
gap
between
it
and
the
next
word
i
will
look
and
see
if
i
can
find
another
anywhere
he
looked
a
long
time
before
he
found
one
for
the
capital
h
was
in
the
way
of
course
there
were
a
good
many
but
not
many
with
a
big
h
and
he
did
know
that
the
little
was
just
as
good
for
the
mere
word
then
he
looked
for
and
he
found
several
of
he
found
as
great
a
swarm
as
if
they
had
been
the
bees
themselves
with
which
the
little
song
was
concerned
was
scarce
i
am
not
sure
whether
he
found
it
at
all
but
he
looked
at
it
until
he
was
pretty
sure
he
should
know
it
again
when
he
saw
it
after
he
had
gone
over
in
this
way
every
word
of
the
first
verse
he
tried
himself
by
putting
his
finger
at
random
here
and
there
upon
it
and
seeing
whether
he
could
tell
the
word
it
happened
to
touch
sometimes
he
could
and
sometimes
he
could
however
as
i
said
before
the
day
was
over
he
knew
at
least
a
dozen
words
perfectly
well
at
sight
nor
let
any
one
think
this
was
other
than
a
great
step
in
the
direction
of
reading
it
would
be
easy
for
willie
afterwards
to
break
up
these
words
into
letters
it
took
him
two
days
more
for
during
part
of
each
he
was
learning
to
make
shoes
to
learn
to
know
anywhere
every
word
he
had
found
in
that
hymn
next
he
took
a
hymn
he
had
not
learned
and
applied
to
his
mother
when
he
came
to
a
word
he
did
not
know
which
was
very
often
as
soon
as
she
told
him
one
he
hunted
about
until
he
found
another
and
another
specimen
of
the
same
and
so
went
on
until
he
had
fixed
it
quite
in
his
mind
at
length
he
began
to
compare
words
that
were
like
each
other
and
by
discovering
wherein
they
looked
the
same
and
wherein
they
looked
different
he
learned
something
of
the
sound
of
the
letters
for
instance
in
comparing
and
although
the
one
sound
of
the
two
letters
and
puzzled
him
and
likewise
the
silent
he
conjectured
that
the
must
stand
for
the
hissing
sound
and
when
he
looked
at
other
words
which
had
that
sound
and
perceived
an
in
every
one
of
them
then
he
was
sure
of
it
his
mother
had
no
idea
how
fast
he
was
learning
and
when
about
a
fortnight
after
he
had
begun
she
was
able
to
take
him
in
hand
she
found
to
her
astonishment
that
he
could
read
a
great
many
words
but
that
when
she
wished
him
to
spell
one
he
had
not
the
least
notion
what
she
meant
is
that
a
she
said
wishing
to
help
him
to
find
out
a
certain
word
for
himself
i
do
know
answered
willie
it
not
the
busy
bee
he
added
laughing
i
should
know
him
it
must
be
the
lazy
one
i
suppose
do
you
know
your
letters
asked
his
mother
no
mamma
which
are
they
are
the
rest
yours
and
papa
oh
you
silly
dear
she
said
of
course
i
am
he
returned
very
silly
how
could
any
of
them
be
mine
before
i
know
the
names
of
them
when
i
know
them
all
then
all
be
mine
i
suppose
and
everybody
else
who
knows
so
mr
b
is
it
yes
and
that
c
said
his
mother
i
glad
to
see
you
mr
c
said
willie
merrily
nodding
to
the
letter
we
shall
know
each
other
when
we
meet
i
suppose
this
is
d
mamma
how
do
mr
d
and
what
this
one
with
its
mouth
open
and
half
its
tongue
cut
off
his
mother
told
him
it
was
then
this
one
with
no
foot
to
stand
on
is
fe
i
suppose
his
mother
laughed
but
whoever
gave
it
the
name
it
has
would
have
done
better
to
call
it
fe
as
willie
did
it
would
be
much
better
also
in
teaching
children
at
least
to
call
h
he
and
w
we
and
y
ye
and
z
ze
as
willie
called
them
but
it
was
easy
enough
for
him
to
learn
their
names
after
he
knew
so
much
of
what
they
could
what
gave
him
a
considerable
advantage
was
that
he
had
begun
with
verse
and
not
dry
syllables
and
stupid
sentences
the
music
of
the
verse
repaid
him
at
once
for
the
trouble
of
making
it
out
even
before
he
got
at
the
meaning
while
the
necessity
of
making
each
line
go
right
and
the
rhymes
too
helped
him
occasionally
to
the
pronunciation
of
a
word
the
farther
he
got
on
the
faster
he
got
on
and
before
six
weeks
were
over
he
could
read
anything
he
was
able
to
understand
pretty
well
at
sight
by
this
time
also
he
understood
all
the
particulars
as
to
how
a
shoe
is
made
and
had
indeed
done
a
few
stitches
himself
a
good
deal
of
hammering
both
of
leather
and
of
and
a
little
patching
at
which
last
the
smallness
of
his
hands
was
an
advantage
at
length
one
day
he
said
to
the
shoemaker
shall
i
read
a
little
poem
to
you
hector
you
told
me
you
could
read
willie
i
can
now
though
do
then
said
hector
looking
for
but
a
small
result
in
such
a
short
time
he
was
considerably
astonished
to
find
how
well
the
boy
could
read
for
he
not
merely
gave
the
words
correctly
but
the
sentences
which
is
far
more
difficult
that
is
he
read
so
that
hector
could
understand
what
the
writer
meant
it
is
a
great
thing
to
read
well
few
can
whoever
reads
aloud
and
does
not
read
well
is
a
sort
of
deceiver
for
he
pretends
to
introduce
one
person
to
another
while
he
misrepresents
him
in
after
life
willie
continued
to
pay
a
good
deal
of
attention
not
merely
to
reading
for
its
own
sake
but
to
reading
for
the
sake
of
other
people
that
is
to
reading
aloud
as
often
as
he
came
in
the
course
of
his
own
reading
to
any
verse
that
he
liked
very
much
he
always
read
it
aloud
in
order
to
teach
himself
how
it
ought
to
be
read
doing
his
best
first
to
make
it
sound
true
that
is
to
read
it
according
to
the
sense
next
to
make
it
sound
beautiful
that
is
to
read
it
according
to
the
measure
of
the
verse
and
the
melody
of
the
words
he
now
read
a
great
deal
to
hector
there
came
to
be
a
certain
time
every
day
at
which
willie
macmichael
was
joyfully
expected
by
the
shoemaker
to
read
to
him
for
an
hour
and
a
half
beyond
which
time
his
father
did
not
wish
the
reading
to
extend
chapter
vii
some
things
that
came
of
willie
going
to
school
when
his
father
found
that
he
had
learned
to
read
then
he
judged
it
good
for
him
to
go
to
school
willie
was
very
much
pleased
his
mother
said
she
would
make
him
a
bag
to
carry
his
books
in
but
willie
said
there
was
no
occasion
to
trouble
herself
for
if
she
would
give
him
the
stuff
he
would
make
it
so
she
got
him
a
nice
bit
of
green
baize
and
in
the
afternoon
he
made
his
bag
no
work
but
good
honest
except
the
which
was
only
run
that
it
might
draw
easier
and
tighter
he
passed
the
string
through
with
a
bodkin
fixed
it
in
the
middle
tied
the
two
ends
and
carried
the
bag
to
his
mother
who
pronounced
it
nearly
as
well
made
as
if
she
had
done
it
herself
at
school
he
found
it
more
and
more
plain
what
a
good
thing
it
is
that
we
have
to
find
out
every
thing
for
ourselves
from
the
beginning
that
people
gather
into
books
what
they
and
all
who
went
before
them
have
learned
so
that
we
come
into
their
property
as
it
were
and
after
being
taught
of
them
have
only
to
begin
our
discoveries
from
where
they
leave
off
in
geography
for
instance
what
a
number
of
voyages
and
journeys
have
had
to
be
made
and
books
to
record
them
written
then
what
a
number
of
these
books
to
be
read
and
the
facts
gathered
out
of
them
before
a
single
map
could
be
drawn
not
to
say
a
geography
book
printed
whereas
now
he
could
learn
a
multitude
of
things
about
the
various
countries
their
peoples
and
animals
and
plants
their
mountains
and
rivers
and
lakes
and
cities
without
having
set
his
foot
beyond
the
parish
in
which
he
was
born
and
so
with
everything
else
after
its
kind
but
it
is
more
of
what
willie
learned
to
do
than
what
he
learned
to
know
that
i
have
to
treat
when
he
went
to
school
his
father
made
him
a
present
of
a
he
had
had
one
before
but
not
a
very
good
one
and
this
having
three
blades
all
very
sharp
he
found
a
wonderful
treasure
of
recourse
his
father
also
bought
him
a
nice
new
slate
now
there
was
another
handy
boy
at
school
a
couple
of
years
older
than
willie
whose
father
was
a
carpenter
he
had
cut
on
the
frame
of
his
slate
not
his
initials
only
but
his
whole
name
and
address
spelman
priory
willie
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
with
his
new
knife
also
to
cut
his
name
on
his
slate
only
he
would
rather
make
some
difference
in
the
way
of
doing
it
what
if
instead
of
sinking
the
letters
in
the
frame
he
made
them
stand
up
from
the
frame
by
cutting
it
away
to
some
depth
all
round
them
there
was
not
much
originality
in
this
for
it
was
only
reversing
what
spelman
had
done
but
it
was
more
difficult
and
would
he
thought
be
prettier
then
what
was
he
thus
to
carve
one
would
say
why
of
course
and
if
he
liked
but
willie
was
a
peculiar
little
fellow
and
began
to
reason
with
himself
whether
he
had
any
right
to
put
his
own
name
on
the
slate
my
father
did
not
give
me
the
slate
he
said
to
be
my
very
own
he
gave
me
the
knife
like
that
but
not
the
slate
when
i
am
grown
up
it
will
belong
to
agnes
what
shall
i
put
on
it
what
mine
papa
and
what
papa
is
his
own
argued
know
he
said
to
himself
at
last
the
boys
could
imagine
what
he
meant
to
do
when
they
saw
him
draw
first
a
d
and
then
an
o
on
the
frame
but
when
they
saw
a
c
and
a
t
follow
they
thought
what
a
conceited
little
prig
willie
was
do
you
think
you
a
doctor
because
your
father
is
you
little
ape
they
said
no
no
answered
willie
laughing
heartily
but
thinking
as
he
went
on
with
his
work
that
he
might
be
one
some
day
when
the
drawing
of
the
letters
was
finished
there
stood
all
round
the
slate
macmichael
willie
the
ruins
priory
then
out
came
his
knife
but
it
was
a
long
job
for
willie
was
not
one
of
those
slovenly
boys
that
their
work
such
boys
are
nothing
but
soft
pulpy
creatures
who
when
they
grow
to
be
men
will
be
too
soft
for
any
of
the
hard
work
of
the
world
they
will
be
fit
only
for
buffers
to
keep
the
working
men
from
breaking
their
heads
against
each
other
in
their
eagerness
but
the
carving
was
at
length
finished
and
gave
much
satisfaction
first
to
willie
himself
because
it
was
finished
next
to
alexander
spelman
priory
leas
because
being
a
boy
he
admired
willie
new
and
superior
work
third
to
mr
and
mrs
macmichael
because
they
saw
in
it
not
the
boy
faculty
merely
but
his
love
to
his
father
as
well
for
the
recognition
of
a
right
over
us
is
one
of
the
sweetest
forms
love
can
take
am
is
the
best
and
greatest
thing
one
can
say
if
to
the
right
person
it
led
to
a
strong
friendship
between
him
and
spelman
and
to
his
going
often
to
the
workshop
of
the
elder
spelman
the
carpenter
he
was
a
solemn
and
man
with
reddish
hair
and
pale
complexion
who
seldom
or
ever
smiled
and
at
the
bench
always
looked
as
if
he
were
standing
on
a
stool
he
stooped
so
immoderately
a
greater
contrast
than
that
between
him
and
the
shoemaker
could
hardly
have
been
found
except
in
this
that
the
carpenter
also
looked
sickly
he
was
in
perfect
health
however
only
oppressed
with
the
cares
of
his
family
and
the
sickness
of
his
wife
who
was
a
constant
invalid
with
more
children
her
husband
thought
than
she
could
well
manage
or
he
well
provide
for
but
if
he
had
thought
less
about
it
he
would
have
got
on
better
he
worked
hard
but
little
fancied
how
many
fewer
strokes
of
his
plane
he
made
in
an
hour
just
because
he
was
brooding
over
his
difficulties
and
imagining
what
would
be
the
consequences
if
this
or
that
misfortune
were
to
befall
him
of
which
he
himself
sought
and
secured
the
shadow
beforehand
to
darken
and
hinder
the
labour
which
might
prevent
its
arrival
but
he
was
a
good
man
nevertheless
for
his
greatest
bugbear
was
debt
if
he
could
only
pay
off
every
penny
he
owed
in
the
world
and
if
only
his
wife
were
so
far
better
as
to
enjoy
life
a
little
he
would
he
thought
be
perfectly
happy
his
wife
however
was
tolerably
happy
notwithstanding
her
weak
health
and
certainly
enjoyed
life
a
good
deal
far
more
at
least
than
her
husband
was
able
to
believe
mr
macmichael
was
very
kind
and
attentive
to
mrs
spelman
though
as
the
carpenter
himself
said
he
had
seen
the
colour
of
money
for
years
but
the
doctor
knew
that
spelman
was
a
man
and
would
rather
have
given
him
a
little
money
than
have
pressed
him
for
a
penny
he
told
him
one
day
when
he
was
lamenting
that
he
could
pay
him
even
that
he
was
only
too
glad
to
do
anything
in
the
least
little
bit
like
what
the
saviour
did
when
he
was
in
the
world
a
carpenter
like
you
spelman
think
of
that
added
the
doctor
so
spelman
was
as
full
of
gratitude
as
he
could
hold
except
hector
macallaster
the
doctor
was
almost
his
only
creditor
medicine
and
shoes
were
his
chief
trials
he
kept
on
paying
for
the
latter
but
the
debt
for
the
former
went
on
accumulating
hence
it
came
that
when
willie
began
to
haunt
his
shop
though
he
had
hardly
a
single
smile
to
give
the
little
fellow
he
was
more
than
pleased
gave
him
odds
and
ends
of
wood
lent
him
whatever
tools
he
wanted
except
the
adze
that
he
would
not
let
him
touch
would
drop
him
a
hint
now
and
then
as
to
the
use
of
them
would
any
moment
stop
his
own
work
to
attend
to
a
difficulty
the
boy
found
himself
in
and
in
short
paid
him
far
more
attention
than
he
would
have
thought
required
of
him
if
willie
had
been
his
apprentice
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
workshop
willie
could
hardly
keep
his
hands
off
the
tools
the
very
shape
of
them
as
they
lay
on
the
bench
or
hung
on
the
wall
seemed
to
say
over
and
over
come
use
me
come
use
me
they
looked
waiting
and
hungry
for
work
they
wanted
stuff
to
shape
and
fashion
into
things
and
join
into
other
things
they
wanted
to
make
bigger
tools
than
themselves
for
ploughing
the
earth
for
carrying
the
harvest
or
for
some
one
or
other
of
ten
thousand
services
to
be
rendered
in
the
house
or
in
the
fields
it
was
impossible
for
willie
to
see
the
hollow
lip
of
the
gouge
the
straight
lip
of
the
chisel
or
the
same
lip
fitted
with
another
lip
and
so
made
into
the
mouth
of
the
plane
the
auger
or
the
critical
spokeshave
the
hammer
which
will
have
it
so
or
the
humble
bradawl
which
is
its
pioneer
he
could
see
none
of
them
without
longing
to
send
his
life
into
theirs
and
set
them
doing
in
the
world
for
was
not
this
what
their
dumb
looks
seemed
ever
to
implore
at
that
time
young
spelman
was
busy
making
a
for
his
mother
out
of
the
sound
bits
of
an
old
oak
floor
which
his
father
had
taken
up
because
it
was
it
was
hard
wood
to
work
but
willie
bore
a
hand
in
planing
the
pieces
and
was
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
dovetailing
and
gluing
before
the
lid
was
put
on
by
the
hinges
he
carved
the
initials
of
the
carpenter
and
his
wife
in
relief
upon
it
and
many
years
after
they
used
to
show
his
work
but
the
first
thing
he
set
about
making
for
himself
was
a
if
he
had
been
a
seaside
boy
his
first
job
would
have
been
a
boat
if
he
had
lived
in
a
flat
country
it
would
very
likely
have
been
a
windmill
but
the
most
noticeable
thing
in
that
neighbourhood
was
a
mill
for
grinding
corn
driven
by
a
when
willie
was
a
tiny
boy
he
had
gone
once
with
farmer
thomson
man
and
a
load
of
corn
to
see
the
mill
and
the
miller
had
taken
him
all
over
it
he
saw
the
corn
go
in
by
the
hopper
into
the
trough
which
was
the
real
hopper
for
it
kept
constantly
hopping
to
shake
the
corn
down
through
a
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
upper
stone
which
went
round
and
round
against
the
lower
so
that
between
them
they
ground
the
corn
to
meal
which
in
the
story
beneath
he
saw
pouring
a
solid
stream
like
an
avalanche
from
a
wooden
spout
but
the
best
of
it
all
was
the
wheel
outside
and
the
busy
rush
of
the
water
that
made
it
go
so
willie
would
now
make
a
illustration
willie
is
taken
to
see
a
the
carpenter
having
given
him
a
short
lecture
on
the
different
kinds
of
he
decided
on
an
undershot
and
with
sandy
help
proceeded
to
construct
it
with
its
nave
of
mahogany
its
spokes
of
birch
its
floats
of
deal
and
its
axle
of
stout
which
as
the
friction
would
not
be
great
was
to
run
in
of
some
hard
wood
well
oiled
these
blocks
were
fixed
in
a
frame
so
devised
that
with
the
help
of
a
few
stones
to
support
it
the
wheel
might
be
set
going
in
any
small
stream
there
were
many
tiny
brooks
running
into
the
river
and
they
fixed
upon
one
of
them
which
issued
from
the
rising
ground
at
the
back
of
the
village
just
where
it
began
to
run
merrily
down
the
hill
they
constructed
in
its
channel
a
stonebed
for
the
not
by
any
means
for
it
to
go
to
sleep
in
it
went
delightfully
and
we
shall
hear
more
of
it
by
and
by
for
the
present
i
have
only
to
confess
that
after
a
few
days
willie
got
tired
of
it
and
small
blame
to
him
for
it
was
of
no
earthly
use
beyond
amusement
and
that
which
can
only
amuse
can
never
amuse
long
i
think
the
reason
children
get
tired
of
their
toys
so
soon
is
just
that
it
is
against
human
nature
to
be
really
interested
in
what
is
of
no
use
if
you
say
that
a
beautiful
thing
is
always
interesting
i
answer
that
a
beautiful
thing
is
of
the
highest
use
is
not
a
diamond
that
flashes
all
its
colours
into
the
heart
of
a
poet
as
useful
as
the
diamond
with
which
the
glazier
divides
the
sheets
of
glass
into
panes
for
our
windows
anyhow
the
reason
willie
got
tired
of
his
was
that
it
went
round
and
round
and
did
nothing
but
go
round
it
drove
no
machinery
ground
no
grain
of
corn
did
nothing
for
willie
said
seeking
to
be
emphatic
so
he
carried
it
home
and
put
it
away
in
a
certain
part
of
the
ruins
where
he
kept
odds
and
ends
of
things
that
might
some
day
come
in
useful
mr
macmichael
was
so
devoted
to
his
profession
that
he
desired
nothing
better
for
willie
than
that
he
too
should
be
a
medical
man
and
he
was
more
than
pleased
to
find
how
well
willie
hands
were
able
to
carry
out
his
contrivances
for
he
judged
it
impossible
for
a
country
doctor
to
have
too
much
mechanical
faculty
the
exercise
of
such
a
skill
alone
might
secure
the
instant
relief
of
a
patient
and
be
the
saving
of
him
but
more
than
this
he
believed
that
nothing
tended
so
much
to
develop
common
sense
the
most
precious
of
faculties
as
the
doing
of
things
with
the
hands
hence
he
not
only
encouraged
willie
in
everything
he
undertook
but
considering
the
five
hours
of
school
quite
sufficient
for
study
of
that
sort
requested
the
master
not
to
give
him
any
lessons
to
do
at
home
so
willie
worked
hard
during
school
and
after
it
had
plenty
of
time
to
spend
in
carpentering
so
that
he
soon
came
to
use
all
the
common
with
ease
and
spelman
was
proud
of
his
apprentice
as
he
called
him
so
much
so
that
the
burden
of
his
debt
grew
much
lighter
upon
his
shoulders
but
willie
did
not
forget
his
older
friend
hector
macallaster
every
he
read
to
him
for
a
couple
of
hours
chiefly
for
some
time
from
dick
astronomy
neither
of
them
understood
all
he
read
but
both
understood
much
and
hector
could
explain
some
of
the
things
that
puzzled
willie
and
when
he
found
that
everything
went
on
in
such
order
above
and
below
and
all
about
him
he
began
to
see
that
even
a
thing
well
done
was
worth
a
good
deal
more
when
done
at
the
right
moment
or
within
the
set
time
and
that
the
heavens
themselves
were
like
a
great
clock
ordering
the
time
for
everything
neither
did
he
give
up
shoemaking
for
he
often
did
a
little
work
for
hector
who
had
made
him
a
leather
apron
and
cut
him
out
bits
of
stout
leather
to
protect
his
hands
from
the
thread
when
he
was
sewing
for
twelve
months
however
his
chief
employment
lay
in
the
workshop
of
the
carpenter
chapter
viii
willie
digs
and
finds
what
he
did
not
expect
he
had
been
reading
to
hector
sir
walter
scott
antiquary
in
which
occurs
the
narration
of
a
digging
for
treasure
in
ruins
not
unlike
these
only
grander
it
was
of
little
consequence
to
willie
that
no
treasure
had
been
found
there
the
propriety
of
digging
remained
the
same
for
in
a
certain
spot
he
had
often
fancied
that
a
hollow
sound
when
he
stamped
hard
indicated
an
empty
place
underneath
i
believe
myself
that
it
came
from
above
and
not
from
beneath
for
although
a
portion
of
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
little
chamber
had
been
broken
in
the
greater
part
of
it
still
remained
and
might
have
caused
a
reverberation
the
floor
was
heaped
up
with
fallen
stones
and
rubbish
one
wednesday
afternoon
instead
of
going
to
hector
whom
he
had
told
not
to
expect
him
he
got
a
pickaxe
and
spade
and
proceeded
to
dig
in
the
trodden
heap
at
the
first
blow
of
the
pickaxe
he
came
upon
large
stones
the
job
of
clearing
out
which
was
by
no
means
an
easy
one
so
far
from
it
indeed
that
after
working
for
half
an
hour
and
only
getting
out
two
large
and
half
a
dozen
smaller
ones
he
resolved
to
ask
sandy
spelman
to
help
him
so
he
left
his
pickaxe
with
one
point
fast
between
two
stones
and
ran
to
the
shop
sandy
was
at
work
but
his
father
was
quite
willing
to
let
him
go
willie
told
them
he
was
digging
for
a
treasure
and
they
all
laughed
over
it
but
at
the
same
time
willie
thought
with
himself
who
knows
people
found
treasures
buried
in
old
places
like
that
the
antiquary
did
not
but
he
is
only
in
a
story
not
in
a
for
that
was
willie
derivation
of
the
word
the
place
sounds
likely
enough
anyhow
where
the
harm
in
trying
they
were
both
so
eager
for
sandy
liked
the
idea
of
digging
in
the
ruins
much
better
than
the
work
he
was
at
that
they
set
off
at
full
speed
the
moment
they
were
out
of
the
shop
and
never
slackened
until
they
stood
panting
by
the
anchored
pickaxe
upon
which
spelman
pounced
and
being
stronger
than
willie
and
more
used
to
hard
work
had
soon
dislodged
both
the
stones
which
held
it
they
were
so
much
larger
however
than
any
willie
had
come
upon
before
that
they
had
to
roll
them
out
of
the
little
chamber
instead
of
lifting
them
after
which
they
got
on
better
and
had
soon
piled
a
good
heap
against
the
wall
outside
after
they
had
had
their
tea
they
set
to
work
again
and
worked
till
the
twilight
grew
dark
about
them
by
which
time
they
had
got
the
heap
down
to
what
seemed
the
original
level
of
the
floor
still
there
were
stones
below
but
what
with
fatigue
and
darkness
they
were
now
compelled
to
stop
and
sandy
went
home
after
promising
to
come
as
early
as
he
could
in
the
morning
and
call
willie
who
was
to
leave
the
end
of
a
string
hanging
out
of
the
staircase
window
whose
other
end
should
pass
through
the
keyhole
of
his
door
and
be
tied
to
his
wrist
he
seemed
to
have
hardly
been
in
bed
an
hour
when
he
woke
with
his
arm
at
full
length
and
the
pulling
going
on
as
if
it
would
pull
him
out
of
bed
he
tugged
again
in
reply
and
jumped
out
it
was
a
lovely
summer
morning
the
sun
a
few
yards
up
the
sky
the
grass
glittering
with
dew
the
birds
singing
as
if
they
were
singing
their
first
and
would
sing
their
last
the
whole
air
even
in
his
little
room
filled
with
a
cool
odour
as
of
blessed
thoughts
and
just
warm
enough
to
let
him
know
that
the
noontide
would
be
hot
and
there
was
sandy
waiting
in
the
street
to
help
him
dig
for
the
treasure
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
opened
the
street
door
and
admitted
him
they
went
straight
to
the
scene
of
their
labour
having
got
out
a
few
more
stones
they
began
to
fancy
they
heard
a
curious
sound
which
they
agreed
was
more
like
that
of
running
water
than
anything
else
they
could
think
of
now
except
a
well
in
the
street
just
before
the
cottage
there
was
no
water
they
knew
of
much
nearer
than
the
river
and
they
wondered
a
good
deal
at
length
sandy
pickaxe
got
hold
of
a
stone
which
he
could
not
move
do
what
he
would
he
tried
another
and
succeeded
but
soon
began
to
suspect
that
there
was
some
masonry
there
contenting
himself
therefore
with
clearing
out
only
the
loose
stones
he
soon
found
plainly
enough
that
he
was
working
in
a
narrow
space
around
which
was
a
circular
wall
of
solid
stone
and
lime
the
sound
of
running
water
was
now
clear
enough
and
the
earth
in
the
hole
was
very
damp
sandy
had
now
got
down
three
or
four
feet
below
the
level
it
an
old
well
he
said
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
does
it
smell
bad
asked
willie
peeping
down
disappointed
not
a
bit
answered
sandy
then
it
not
stagnant
said
willie
you
might
have
told
that
by
your
ears
without
troubling
your
nose
said
sandy
did
you
hear
it
running
how
can
it
be
running
when
it
buried
away
down
there
said
willie
how
can
it
make
a
noise
if
it
is
running
retorted
sandy
to
which
question
willie
attempted
no
reply
it
was
now
serious
work
to
get
the
stones
up
for
sandy
head
only
was
above
the
level
of
the
ground
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
lift
some
of
the
larger
ones
out
of
the
hole
and
willie
saw
that
he
must
contrive
to
give
him
some
help
he
ran
therefore
to
the
house
and
brought
a
rope
which
he
had
seen
lying
about
one
end
of
it
sandy
tied
round
whatever
stone
was
too
heavy
for
him
and
willie
laying
hold
of
the
other
lifted
along
with
him
they
got
on
faster
now
and
in
a
few
minutes
sandy
exclaimed
here
it
is
at
last
the
treasure
cried
willie
oh
jolly
sandy
burst
out
laughing
and
shouted
the
water
bother
the
water
growled
willie
but
go
on
sandy
the
iron
chest
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
you
know
all
very
well
for
you
up
there
retorted
sandy
but
though
i
can
get
the
stones
out
i
ca
get
the
water
out
and
i
no
notion
of
diving
where
there
pretty
sure
to
be
nothing
to
dive
for
besides
a
body
ca
dive
in
a
stone
pipe
like
this
i
should
want
weights
to
sink
me
and
i
might
get
them
off
in
time
i
want
my
breakfast
dreadful
willie
so
saying
he
scrambled
up
the
side
of
the
well
and
the
last
of
him
that
appeared
his
boots
namely
bore
testimony
enough
to
his
having
reached
the
water
willie
peered
down
into
the
well
and
caught
the
dull
glimmer
of
it
through
the
stones
then
a
good
deal
disappointed
followed
sandy
as
he
strode
away
towards
the
house
you
come
and
have
your
breakfast
with
me
sandy
wo
you
he
said
from
behind
him
no
thank
you
answered
sandy
i
do
like
any
porridge
but
my
mother
and
without
looking
behind
him
he
walked
right
through
the
cottage
and
away
home
before
willie
had
finished
his
porridge
he
had
got
over
his
disappointment
and
had
even
begun
to
see
that
he
had
never
really
expected
to
find
a
treasure
only
it
would
have
been
fun
to
hand
it
over
to
his
father
all
through
morning
school
however
his
thoughts
would
go
back
to
the
little
vault
so
cool
and
shadowy
sheltering
its
ancient
well
from
the
light
that
lorded
it
over
all
the
country
outside
no
doubt
the
streams
rejoiced
in
it
but
even
for
them
it
would
be
too
much
before
the
evening
came
to
cool
and
console
them
while
the
slow
wells
in
the
marshy
ground
up
on
the
mountains
must
feel
faint
in
an
hour
of
its
burning
eye
this
well
had
always
been
and
always
would
be
cool
and
blessed
and
sweet
like
like
a
precious
thing
you
can
only
think
about
and
was
it
a
nice
thing
to
have
a
well
of
your
own
tibby
need
go
any
more
to
the
village
pump
which
certainly
was
nearer
but
stood
in
the
street
not
in
their
own
ground
of
course
as
yet
she
could
not
draw
a
bucketful
for
the
water
hardly
came
above
the
stones
but
he
would
soon
get
out
as
many
as
would
make
it
deep
enough
only
if
it
was
all
sandy
could
do
to
get
out
the
big
ones
and
that
with
his
help
too
how
was
he
to
manage
it
alone
there
was
the
rub
i
must
go
back
a
little
to
explain
how
he
came
to
think
of
a
plan
after
hector
and
he
had
gone
as
far
in
dr
dick
astronomy
as
they
could
understand
they
found
they
were
getting
themselves
into
what
seemed
quite
a
jungle
of
planets
and
suns
and
comets
and
constellations
it
seems
to
me
said
the
shoemaker
that
to
understand
anything
you
must
understand
everything
so
they
laid
the
book
aside
for
the
present
and
hector
searching
about
for
another
with
which
to
fill
up
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
came
upon
one
in
which
the
mechanical
powers
were
treated
after
a
simple
fashion
of
this
book
willie
had
now
read
a
good
deal
i
can
not
say
that
he
had
yet
come
to
understand
the
mechanical
power
so
thoroughly
as
to
see
that
the
lever
and
the
are
the
same
in
kind
or
that
the
screw
the
inclined
plane
and
the
wedge
are
the
same
power
in
different
shapes
but
he
did
understand
that
while
a
single
pulley
gives
you
no
advantage
except
by
enabling
you
to
apply
your
strength
in
the
most
effective
manner
a
second
pulley
takes
half
the
weight
off
you
hence
with
the
difficulty
in
which
he
now
found
himself
came
at
once
the
thought
of
a
block
with
a
pulley
in
it
which
he
had
seen
lying
about
in
the
carpenter
shop
he
remembered
also
that
there
was
a
great
iron
staple
or
in
the
vault
just
over
the
well
and
if
he
could
only
get
hold
of
a
second
pulley
the
thing
was
as
good
as
done
the
well
as
good
as
cleared
out
to
whatever
depth
he
could
reach
below
the
water
as
soon
as
school
was
over
he
ran
to
mr
spelman
and
found
to
his
delight
that
he
could
lend
him
not
only
that
pulley
but
another
as
well
each
ran
in
a
block
which
had
an
iron
hook
attached
to
it
with
the
aid
of
a
ladder
he
put
the
hook
of
one
of
the
blocks
through
the
staple
and
then
fastened
the
end
of
his
rope
to
the
block
next
he
got
another
bit
of
rope
and
having
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
and
got
down
into
the
well
tied
it
round
the
largest
stone
within
reach
loosely
enough
to
allow
the
hook
of
the
second
pulley
to
lay
hold
of
it
then
as
a
sailor
would
say
he
rove
the
end
of
the
long
rope
through
this
block
and
getting
up
on
the
ladder
again
rove
it
also
through
the
first
block
which
he
had
left
hanging
to
the
staple
all
preparations
thus
completed
he
stood
by
the
well
and
hauled
away
at
the
rope
it
came
slipping
through
the
pulleys
and
up
rose
the
stone
from
the
well
as
if
by
magic
as
soon
as
it
came
clear
of
the
edge
he
drew
it
towards
him
lowered
it
to
the
ground
took
off
its
rope
collar
and
rolled
it
out
of
the
doorway
then
he
got
into
the
well
again
tied
the
collar
about
another
stone
drew
down
the
pulley
thrust
its
hook
through
the
collar
got
out
of
the
well
and
hauled
up
the
second
stone
in
this
way
he
had
soon
got
out
so
many
that
he
was
standing
far
above
his
ankles
in
the
water
which
was
so
cold
that
he
was
glad
to
get
out
to
pull
up
every
stone
by
this
time
it
was
perfectly
explained
how
the
water
made
a
noise
for
he
saw
it
escape
by
an
opening
in
the
side
of
the
well
he
came
at
last
to
a
huge
stone
round
which
it
was
with
difficulty
he
managed
to
fasten
the
rope
he
had
to
pull
away
smaller
stones
from
beneath
it
and
pass
the
rope
through
under
it
having
lifted
it
a
little
way
with
the
powerful
help
of
his
tackle
to
try
if
all
was
right
before
he
got
out
to
haul
in
earnest
he
saw
that
his
knot
was
slipping
and
lowered
the
stone
again
so
as
to
set
it
on
one
end
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
well
when
he
discovered
that
his
rope
collar
had
got
so
frayed
that
one
of
the
strands
was
cut
through
it
would
probably
break
and
let
the
stone
fall
again
into
the
well
when
he
would
still
more
probably
tumble
after
it
he
was
getting
tired
too
and
it
was
growing
very
dusky
in
the
ruins
he
thought
it
better
to
postpone
further
proceedings
and
getting
out
of
the
well
caught
up
his
shoes
and
stockings
and
went
into
the
house
chapter
ix
a
marvel
early
the
next
morning
mr
macmichael
as
he
was
dressing
heard
a
laugh
of
strange
delight
in
the
garden
and
drawing
up
the
blind
looked
out
there
some
distance
off
stood
willie
the
one
moment
staring
motionless
at
something
at
his
feet
the
other
dancing
and
skipping
and
singing
but
still
looking
down
at
something
at
his
feet
his
father
could
not
see
what
this
something
was
for
willie
was
on
the
other
side
of
one
of
the
mounds
and
was
turning
away
to
finish
his
dressing
when
from
another
direction
a
peculiar
glitter
caught
his
eye
what
can
this
mean
he
said
to
himself
water
in
the
garden
been
no
rain
and
there
neither
river
nor
reservoir
to
overflow
i
can
hardly
believe
my
eyes
he
hurried
on
the
remainder
of
his
clothes
and
went
out
but
he
had
not
gone
many
steps
when
what
should
he
meet
but
a
merry
little
brook
coming
cantering
down
between
two
of
the
mounds
it
had
already
worn
itself
a
channel
in
the
path
he
followed
it
up
wondering
much
bewildered
indeed
and
had
got
to
a
little
turfy
hollow
down
the
middle
of
which
it
came
bubbling
and
gabbling
along
when
willie
caught
sight
of
him
and
bounded
to
meet
him
with
a
radiant
countenance
and
almost
inarticulate
cries
of
delight
am
i
awake
willie
or
am
i
dreaming
he
asked
wide
awake
papa
answered
willie
then
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
seem
to
be
in
the
secret
where
does
this
water
come
from
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
a
fairy
tale
is
it
lovely
cried
willie
i
show
you
where
it
comes
from
this
way
you
spoil
your
boots
there
look
at
the
turned
into
a
swamp
the
garden
will
be
ruined
said
his
father
no
no
papa
we
wo
let
it
come
to
that
i
been
watching
it
there
no
soil
carried
away
yet
do
come
and
see
in
mute
astonishment
his
father
followed
as
i
have
already
described
it
the
ground
was
very
uneven
with
many
heights
and
hollows
whence
it
came
that
the
water
took
an
amazing
number
of
twists
and
turns
willie
led
his
father
as
straight
as
he
could
but
i
do
know
how
often
they
crossed
the
little
brook
before
they
came
to
where
from
the
old
stone
shaft
like
the
crater
of
a
volcano
it
rolled
over
the
brim
an
eruption
of
cool
clear
lucid
water
plenteous
it
rose
and
overflowed
like
a
dark
yet
clear
molten
gem
tumbling
itself
into
the
open
world
how
deliciously
wet
it
looked
in
the
shadow
i
it
caught
the
sun
the
moment
it
left
the
chamber
grew
merry
and
trotted
and
trolled
and
cantered
along
is
this
work
willie
asked
his
father
who
did
not
know
which
of
twenty
questions
to
ask
first
mostly
said
willie
you
little
wizard
what
have
you
been
about
i
ca
understand
it
we
must
make
a
drain
for
it
at
once
bury
a
beauty
like
that
in
a
drain
cried
willie
o
papa
well
i
do
know
what
else
to
do
with
it
how
is
it
that
it
never
found
its
way
out
before
somewhere
or
other
i
soon
show
you
that
said
willie
i
soon
send
it
about
its
business
he
had
thought
when
he
first
saw
the
issuing
water
that
the
weight
of
the
fallen
stones
and
the
hard
covering
of
earth
being
removed
the
spring
had
burst
out
with
tenfold
volume
and
vigour
but
had
satisfied
himself
by
thinking
about
it
that
the
cause
of
the
overflow
must
be
the
great
stone
he
had
set
leaning
against
the
side
the
last
thing
before
dropping
work
the
previous
night
it
must
have
blocked
up
the
opening
and
prevented
the
water
from
getting
out
as
fast
as
before
that
is
as
fast
as
the
spring
rose
therefore
he
now
laid
hold
of
the
rope
which
was
still
connected
with
the
stone
and
not
aware
of
how
the
water
would
help
him
by
partly
floating
it
was
astonished
to
find
how
easily
he
moved
it
at
once
it
swung
away
from
the
side
into
the
middle
of
the
well
the
water
ceased
to
run
over
the
edge
with
a
loud
gurgling
began
to
sink
and
sank
down
and
down
and
down
until
the
opening
by
which
it
escaped
was
visible
ah
now
now
i
understand
cried
mr
macmichael
it
the
old
well
of
the
priory
you
come
upon
you
little
burrowing
mole
sandy
helped
me
out
with
the
stones
i
thought
there
might
be
a
treasure
down
there
and
that
set
me
digging
it
was
a
funny
treasure
to
find
was
it
no
treasure
could
have
been
prettier
though
if
this
be
the
prior
well
and
all
be
true
they
said
about
it
in
old
times
returned
his
father
it
may
turn
out
a
greater
treasure
than
you
even
hoped
for
willie
why
as
i
found
some
time
ago
in
an
old
book
about
the
monasteries
of
the
country
people
used
to
come
from
great
distances
to
drink
the
water
of
the
prior
well
believing
it
a
cure
for
every
disease
under
the
sun
run
into
the
house
and
fetch
me
a
jug
yes
papa
said
willie
and
bounded
off
there
was
no
little
brook
careering
through
the
garden
now
only
a
few
pools
here
and
there
and
its
channel
would
soon
be
dry
in
the
hot
sun
but
willie
thought
how
delightful
it
was
to
be
able
to
have
one
there
whenever
he
pleased
and
it
might
be
a
much
bigger
brook
too
for
instead
of
using
the
stone
which
could
but
partly
block
the
water
from
the
underground
way
he
would
cut
a
piece
of
wood
large
enough
to
cover
the
opening
and
rounded
a
little
to
fit
the
side
of
the
well
then
he
would
put
the
big
stone
just
so
far
from
the
opening
that
the
piece
of
wood
could
get
through
between
it
and
the
side
of
the
well
and
so
be
held
tight
then
all
the
water
would
be
forced
to
mount
up
get
out
at
the
top
and
run
through
the
garden
meantime
mr
macmichael
having
gone
to
see
what
course
the
water
had
taken
and
how
it
had
left
the
garden
found
that
after
a
very
circuitous
route
it
had
run
through
the
hedge
into
a
surface
drain
in
the
field
and
so
down
the
hill
towards
the
river
when
willie
brought
him
the
jug
he
filled
it
from
the
well
and
carried
the
water
into
his
surgery
there
he
put
a
little
of
it
into
several
different
glasses
and
dropping
something
out
of
one
bottle
into
one
glass
and
something
out
of
another
bottle
into
another
glass
soon
satisfied
himself
that
it
contained
medicinal
salts
in
considerable
quantities
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
willie
had
found
the
well
it
a
good
thing
said
his
father
at
breakfast
that
you
flood
the
house
willie
one
turn
more
and
the
stream
would
have
been
in
at
the
it
would
have
done
much
harm
said
willie
it
would
have
run
along
the
slabs
in
the
passage
and
out
again
for
the
front
door
is
lower
than
the
back
it
would
have
been
such
fun
you
mischievous
little
thing
said
his
mother
pretending
to
scold
him
you
do
think
what
trouble
you
would
have
given
tibby
but
would
it
have
been
fun
and
would
it
have
been
lovely
running
through
the
house
all
the
hot
summer
day
there
may
be
a
difference
of
opinion
about
that
master
willie
said
his
mother
you
for
instance
might
like
to
walk
through
water
every
time
you
went
from
the
parlour
to
the
kitchen
but
i
ca
say
i
should
curious
to
know
whether
the
village
pump
might
not
be
supplied
from
his
well
mr
macmichael
next
analysed
the
water
of
that
also
and
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
no
connection
between
them
within
the
next
fortnight
willie
discovered
that
as
often
as
the
stream
ran
through
the
garden
the
little
brook
in
which
he
had
set
his
going
was
nearly
dry
he
had
soon
made
a
nice
little
channel
for
it
so
that
it
should
not
get
into
any
of
the
beds
he
laid
down
turf
along
its
banks
in
some
parts
and
sowed
grass
and
in
others
and
when
he
found
a
pretty
stone
or
shell
or
bit
of
coloured
glass
or
bright
crockery
or
broken
mirror
he
would
always
throw
it
in
that
the
water
might
have
the
prettier
path
to
run
upon
indeed
he
emptied
his
store
of
marbles
into
it
he
was
not
particularly
fond
of
playing
with
marbles
but
he
had
a
great
fancy
for
those
of
real
white
marble
with
lovely
red
streaks
and
had
collected
some
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
he
kept
them
in
the
brook
now
instead
of
in
a
calico
bag
the
summer
was
a
very
hot
and
dry
one
more
than
any
of
the
rest
of
the
gardens
in
the
village
that
of
the
ruins
suffered
from
such
weather
for
not
only
was
there
a
deep
under
its
mould
but
a
good
part
of
its
produce
grew
on
the
mounds
which
were
mostly
heaps
of
stones
and
neither
gravel
nor
stones
could
retain
much
moisture
willie
watered
it
a
good
deal
out
of
the
prior
well
but
it
was
hard
work
and
did
not
seem
to
be
of
much
use
one
evening
when
he
had
set
the
little
brook
free
to
run
through
the
garden
and
the
sun
was
setting
huge
and
red
with
the
promise
of
another
glowing
day
and
the
air
was
stifling
and
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirring
so
that
the
flowers
hung
their
heads
oppressed
and
the
leaves
and
little
buttons
of
fruit
on
the
trees
looked
ready
to
shrivel
up
and
drop
from
the
boughs
the
thought
came
to
him
whether
he
could
not
turn
the
brook
into
a
little
nile
causing
it
to
overflow
its
banks
and
enrich
the
garden
he
could
not
of
course
bring
it
about
in
the
same
way
for
the
nile
overflows
from
the
quantities
of
rain
up
in
the
mountains
making
huge
torrents
rush
into
it
faster
than
its
channel
through
a
slow
level
country
can
carry
the
water
away
so
that
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
overflow
if
however
he
could
not
make
more
water
run
out
of
the
well
he
could
make
it
more
difficult
for
what
did
come
from
it
to
get
away
first
he
stopped
up
the
outlet
through
the
hedge
with
stones
and
clay
and
bits
of
board
then
watched
as
it
spread
until
he
saw
where
it
would
try
to
escape
next
and
did
the
same
and
so
on
taking
care
especially
to
keep
it
from
the
house
the
mounds
were
a
great
assistance
to
him
in
hemming
it
in
but
he
had
hard
enough
work
of
it
notwithstanding
and
soon
perceived
that
at
one
spot
it
would
get
the
better
of
him
in
a
few
minutes
and
make
straight
for
the
he
ran
at
once
and
opened
the
sluice
in
the
well
and
away
the
stream
gurgled
underground
before
morning
the
water
it
left
had
all
disappeared
it
had
soaked
through
the
mounds
and
into
the
gravel
but
comforting
the
hot
roots
as
it
went
and
feeding
them
with
dissolved
minerals
doubtless
also
it
lay
all
night
in
many
a
little
hidden
pool
which
the
heat
of
the
next
day
sun
drew
up
comforting
again
through
the
roots
in
the
earth
and
through
the
leaves
in
the
air
up
into
the
sky
willie
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
garden
looked
refreshed
the
green
was
brighter
he
thought
and
the
flowers
held
up
their
heads
a
little
better
the
carrots
looked
more
feathery
and
the
ferns
more
palmy
everything
looked
he
said
just
as
he
felt
after
a
good
drink
out
of
the
well
at
all
events
he
resolved
to
do
the
same
every
night
after
sunset
while
the
hot
weather
lasted
that
was
if
his
father
had
no
objection
mr
macmichael
said
he
might
try
it
only
he
must
mind
and
not
go
to
bed
and
leave
the
water
running
else
they
would
have
a
cartload
of
mud
in
the
house
before
morning
so
willie
strengthened
and
heightened
his
barriers
and
having
built
a
huge
one
at
the
last
point
where
the
water
had
tried
to
get
away
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
down
shut
the
sluice
and
watched
the
water
as
it
surged
up
in
the
throat
of
the
well
and
rushed
out
to
be
caught
in
the
toils
he
had
made
for
it
before
it
could
find
a
fresh
place
to
get
out
at
the
whole
upper
part
of
the
garden
was
one
network
of
lakes
and
islands
willie
kept
walking
round
and
round
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
wild
beast
trying
to
get
out
of
its
cage
and
he
had
to
watch
and
prevent
it
at
every
weak
spot
or
as
if
he
were
a
magician
busily
sustaining
the
charm
by
which
he
confined
the
creature
the
moment
he
saw
it
beginning
to
get
the
better
of
him
he
ran
to
the
sluice
and
banished
it
to
the
regions
below
then
he
fetched
an
old
newspaper
and
sitting
down
on
the
borders
of
his
lake
fashioned
boat
after
boat
out
of
the
paper
and
sent
them
sailing
like
merchant
ships
from
isle
to
blooming
isle
night
after
night
he
flooded
the
garden
and
always
before
morning
the
water
had
sunk
away
through
the
gravel
soon
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
everything
was
mightily
refreshed
by
it
the
look
of
exhaustion
and
hopelessness
was
gone
and
life
was
busy
in
flower
and
tree
and
plant
this
year
there
was
not
a
garden
even
on
the
banks
of
the
river
to
compare
with
it
and
when
the
autumn
came
there
was
more
fruit
than
mr
macmichael
remembered
ever
to
have
seen
before
chapter
x
a
new
alarum
willie
was
always
thinking
what
uses
he
could
put
things
to
only
he
was
never
tempted
to
set
a
fine
thing
to
do
dirty
work
as
do
for
instance
when
they
make
the
channel
of
a
lovely
serve
for
a
drain
to
carry
off
the
filth
from
their
works
if
dante
had
known
any
such
i
know
where
he
would
have
put
them
but
i
would
rather
not
describe
the
place
i
have
told
you
what
willie
made
the
prisoned
stream
do
for
the
garden
i
will
now
tell
you
what
he
made
the
running
stream
do
for
himself
and
you
shall
judge
whether
or
not
that
was
fit
work
for
him
to
require
of
it
ever
since
he
had
ceased
being
to
little
agnes
he
had
wished
that
he
had
some
one
to
wake
him
every
night
about
the
middle
of
it
that
he
might
get
up
and
look
out
of
the
window
for
after
he
had
fed
his
and
given
her
back
to
his
mother
in
a
state
of
contentment
before
getting
into
bed
again
he
had
always
looked
out
of
the
window
to
see
what
the
night
was
like
not
that
he
was
one
bit
anxious
about
the
weather
except
indeed
he
heard
his
papa
getting
up
to
go
out
or
knew
that
he
had
to
go
for
he
could
enjoy
weather
of
any
sort
and
all
sorts
and
never
thought
what
the
next
day
would
be
like
but
just
to
see
what
madame
night
was
thinking
about
how
she
looked
and
what
she
was
doing
for
he
had
soon
found
her
such
a
changeful
creature
that
every
time
he
looked
at
her
she
looked
at
him
with
another
face
from
that
she
had
worn
last
time
before
he
had
made
this
acquaintance
with
the
night
he
would
often
ere
he
fell
asleep
lie
wondering
what
he
was
going
to
dream
about
for
with
all
his
practical
tendencies
willie
was
very
fond
of
dreaming
but
after
he
had
begun
in
this
manner
to
make
acquaintance
with
her
he
would
just
as
often
fall
asleep
wondering
what
the
day
would
be
dreaming
about
for
in
his
own
fanciful
way
of
thinking
he
had
settled
that
the
look
of
the
night
was
what
the
day
was
dreaming
hence
when
agnes
required
his
services
no
longer
he
fell
asleep
the
first
night
with
the
full
intention
of
waking
just
as
before
and
getting
up
to
have
a
peep
into
the
day
dream
whatever
it
might
be
that
night
and
every
night
thereafter
but
he
was
now
back
in
his
own
room
and
there
was
nothing
to
wake
him
so
he
slept
sound
until
the
day
had
done
dreaming
and
the
morning
was
wide
awake
neither
had
he
awoke
any
one
night
since
or
seen
what
marvel
there
might
be
beyond
his
windowpanes
does
any
little
boy
or
girl
wonder
what
there
can
be
going
on
when
we
are
asleep
sometimes
the
stars
sometimes
the
moon
sometimes
the
clouds
sometimes
the
wind
sometimes
the
snow
sometimes
the
frost
sometimes
all
of
them
together
are
busy
sometimes
the
owl
and
the
moth
and
the
beetle
and
the
bat
and
the
cat
and
the
rat
are
all
at
work
sometimes
there
are
flowers
in
bloom
that
love
the
night
better
than
the
day
and
are
busy
all
through
the
darkness
pouring
out
on
the
still
air
the
scent
they
withheld
during
the
sunlight
sometimes
the
lightning
and
the
thunder
sometimes
the
sometimes
the
aurora
borealis
is
busy
and
the
streams
are
running
all
night
long
and
seem
to
babble
louder
than
in
the
day
time
for
the
noises
of
the
working
world
are
still
so
that
we
hear
them
better
almost
the
only
daylight
thing
awake
is
the
clock
ticking
with
nobody
to
heed
it
and
that
sounds
to
me
very
dismal
but
it
was
the
look
of
the
night
the
meaning
on
her
face
that
willie
cared
most
about
and
desired
so
much
to
see
that
he
was
at
times
quite
unhappy
to
think
that
he
never
could
wake
up
not
although
ever
so
many
strange
and
lovely
dreams
might
be
passing
before
his
window
he
often
dreamed
that
he
had
waked
up
and
was
looking
out
on
some
gorgeous
and
lovely
show
but
in
the
morning
he
knew
sorrowfully
that
he
had
only
dreamed
his
own
dream
not
gazed
into
that
of
the
sleeping
day
again
and
again
he
had
worked
his
brains
to
weariness
trying
and
trying
to
invent
some
machine
that
should
wake
him
but
although
he
was
older
and
cleverer
now
he
fared
no
better
than
when
he
wanted
to
wake
himself
to
help
his
mother
with
agnes
he
must
have
some
motive
power
before
he
could
do
anything
and
the
clock
was
still
the
only
power
he
could
think
of
and
that
he
was
afraid
to
meddle
with
for
its
works
were
beyond
him
and
it
was
so
essential
to
the
of
the
house
that
he
would
not
venture
putting
it
in
jeopardy
one
day
however
when
he
was
thinking
nothing
about
it
all
at
once
it
struck
him
that
he
had
another
motive
power
at
his
command
and
the
thought
had
hardly
entered
his
mind
before
he
saw
also
how
it
was
possible
to
turn
it
to
account
his
motive
power
was
the
stream
from
the
prior
well
and
the
means
of
using
it
for
his
purpose
stood
on
a
shelf
in
the
ruins
in
the
shape
of
the
toy
which
he
had
laid
aside
as
distressingly
useless
he
set
about
the
thing
at
once
first
of
all
he
made
a
second
bit
of
channel
for
the
stream
like
a
little
loop
to
the
first
so
that
he
could
when
he
pleased
turn
a
part
of
the
water
into
it
and
let
it
again
join
the
principal
channel
a
little
lower
down
this
was
in
fact
his
just
before
it
joined
the
older
part
again
right
opposite
his
window
he
made
it
run
for
a
little
way
in
a
direct
line
towards
the
house
and
in
this
part
of
the
new
channel
he
made
preparations
for
his
into
the
channel
he
laid
a
piece
of
iron
pipe
which
had
been
lying
about
useless
for
years
and
just
where
the
water
would
issue
in
a
concentrated
rush
from
the
lower
end
of
it
he
constructed
a
foundation
for
his
wheel
similar
to
that
sandy
and
he
had
built
for
it
before
the
water
as
it
issued
from
the
pipe
should
strike
straight
upon
its
floats
and
send
it
whirling
round
it
took
him
some
time
to
build
it
for
he
wanted
this
to
be
a
good
and
permanent
job
he
had
stones
at
command
he
had
a
well
he
said
that
yielded
both
stones
and
water
which
was
more
than
everybody
could
say
and
in
order
to
make
it
a
sound
bit
of
work
he
fetched
a
lump
of
from
the
kiln
where
they
burned
quantities
of
it
to
scatter
over
the
and
first
wetting
it
with
water
till
it
fell
into
powder
and
then
mixing
it
with
sand
which
he
riddled
from
the
gravel
he
dug
from
the
garden
he
made
it
into
good
strong
mortar
when
its
bed
was
at
length
made
for
it
he
took
the
wheel
and
put
in
a
longer
axis
to
project
on
one
side
beyond
the
or
hollow
in
which
it
turned
and
upon
this
projecting
piece
he
fixed
a
large
reel
then
having
put
the
wheel
in
its
place
he
asked
his
father
for
sixpence
part
of
which
he
laid
out
on
a
large
ball
of
the
outside
end
of
the
ball
he
fastened
to
the
reel
then
threw
the
ball
through
the
open
window
into
his
room
and
there
undid
it
from
the
inside
end
laying
the
thread
in
coils
on
the
floor
when
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
he
ran
out
and
turned
the
water
first
into
the
garden
and
then
into
the
new
channel
when
suddenly
the
wheel
began
to
spin
about
and
wind
the
on
to
the
reel
he
ran
to
his
room
and
undressed
faster
than
he
had
ever
done
before
tied
the
other
end
of
the
thread
around
his
wrist
and
although
kept
awake
much
longer
than
usual
by
his
excitement
at
length
fell
fast
asleep
and
dreamed
that
the
thread
had
waked
him
and
drawn
him
to
the
window
where
he
saw
the
flashing
like
a
and
the
water
rushing
away
from
under
it
in
a
green
flame
when
he
did
wake
it
was
broad
day
the
coils
of
were
lying
on
the
floor
scarcely
diminished
the
brook
was
singing
in
the
garden
and
when
he
went
to
the
window
he
saw
the
wheel
spinning
merrily
round
he
dressed
in
haste
ran
out
and
found
that
the
thread
had
got
entangled
amongst
the
bushes
on
its
way
to
the
wheel
and
had
stuck
fast
whereupon
the
wheel
had
broken
it
to
get
loose
and
had
been
spinning
round
and
round
all
night
for
nothing
like
the
useless
thing
it
was
before
that
afternoon
he
set
poles
up
for
guides
along
the
top
of
which
the
thread
might
run
and
so
keep
clear
of
the
bushes
but
he
fared
no
better
the
next
night
for
he
never
waked
until
the
morning
when
he
found
that
the
wheel
stood
stock
still
for
the
thread
having
filled
the
reel
had
slipped
off
and
so
wound
itself
about
the
wheel
that
it
was
choked
in
its
many
windings
indeed
the
thread
was
in
a
wonderful
tangle
about
the
whole
machine
and
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
unwind
turning
the
wheel
backwards
so
as
not
to
break
the
thread
in
order
to
remove
the
cause
of
this
fresh
failure
he
went
to
the
turner
whose
name
was
william
burt
and
asked
him
to
turn
for
him
a
large
reel
or
spool
with
deep
ends
and
small
cylinder
between
william
told
him
he
was
very
busy
just
then
but
he
would
fix
a
suitable
piece
of
wood
for
him
on
his
old
lathe
with
which
as
he
knew
him
to
be
a
handy
boy
he
might
turn
what
he
wanted
for
himself
this
was
his
first
attempt
at
the
use
of
the
but
he
had
often
watched
william
at
work
and
was
familiar
with
the
way
in
which
he
held
his
tool
hence
the
result
was
tolerably
satisfactory
long
before
he
had
reached
the
depth
of
which
he
wished
to
make
the
spool
he
had
learned
to
manage
his
chisel
with
some
nicety
burt
finished
it
off
for
him
with
just
a
few
touches
and
delighted
with
his
acquisition
of
the
rudiments
of
a
new
trade
he
carried
the
spool
home
with
him
to
try
once
more
the
possibility
of
educating
his
into
a
watchman
that
night
the
pull
did
indeed
come
but
alas
before
he
had
even
fallen
asleep
something
seemed
to
be
always
going
wrong
he
concluded
already
that
it
was
a
difficult
thing
to
make
a
machine
which
should
do
just
what
the
maker
wished
the
spool
had
gone
flying
round
and
had
swallowed
up
the
thread
incredibly
fast
he
made
haste
to
get
the
end
off
his
wrist
and
saw
it
fly
through
the
little
hole
in
the
window
frame
and
away
after
the
rest
of
it
to
be
wound
on
the
whirling
spool
disappointing
as
this
was
however
there
was
progress
in
it
he
had
got
the
thing
to
work
and
all
that
remained
was
to
regulate
it
but
this
turned
out
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
affair
by
far
he
saw
at
once
that
if
he
were
only
to
make
the
thread
longer
which
was
the
first
mode
that
suggested
itself
he
would
increase
the
constant
danger
there
was
of
its
getting
fouled
not
to
mention
the
awkwardness
of
using
such
a
quantity
of
it
if
the
kitten
were
to
get
into
the
room
for
instance
after
he
had
laid
it
down
she
would
ruin
his
every
hope
for
the
time
being
and
in
willie
eyes
sixpence
was
a
huge
sum
to
ask
from
his
father
but
if
on
the
contrary
he
could
find
out
any
mode
of
making
the
machine
wind
more
slowly
he
might
then
be
able
to
shorten
instead
of
lengthening
the
string
at
length
after
much
pondering
he
came
to
see
that
if
instead
of
the
spool
he
were
to
fix
on
the
axis
a
small
cogged
wheel
that
is
a
wheel
with
teeth
and
then
make
these
cogs
fit
into
the
cogs
of
a
much
larger
wheel
the
small
wheel
which
would
turn
once
with
every
turn
of
the
must
turn
a
great
many
times
before
it
could
turn
the
big
wheel
once
then
he
must
fix
the
spool
on
the
axis
of
this
great
slow
wheel
when
turning
only
as
often
as
the
wheel
turned
the
spool
would
wind
the
thread
so
much
the
more
slowly
i
will
not
weary
my
reader
with
any
further
detail
of
willie
efforts
and
failures
it
is
enough
to
say
that
he
was
at
last
so
entirely
successful
in
timing
his
machine
for
the
run
of
the
water
was
always
the
same
that
he
could
tell
exactly
how
much
thread
it
would
wind
in
a
given
time
having
then
measured
off
the
thread
with
a
mark
of
ink
for
the
first
hour
two
for
the
second
and
so
on
he
was
able
to
set
his
alarum
according
to
the
time
at
which
he
wished
to
be
woke
by
the
pull
at
his
wrist
but
if
any
one
had
happened
to
go
into
the
garden
after
the
household
was
asleep
and
had
come
upon
the
toy
working
away
in
starlight
or
moonlight
how
little
even
if
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
nearly
invisible
thread
and
had
discovered
that
the
wheel
was
winding
it
up
would
he
have
thought
what
the
tiny
machine
was
about
how
little
would
he
have
thought
that
its
business
was
with
the
infinite
that
it
was
in
connection
with
the
window
of
an
eternal
world
namely
soul
from
which
at
a
given
moment
it
would
lift
the
curtains
namely
the
eyelids
and
let
the
night
of
the
outer
world
in
upon
the
thought
and
feeling
of
the
boy
to
use
a
likeness
the
wheel
was
thus
ever
working
to
draw
up
the
slide
of
a
and
let
in
whatever
pictures
might
be
abroad
in
the
dreams
of
the
day
that
the
watcher
within
might
behold
them
indeed
one
night
as
he
came
home
from
visiting
a
patient
soon
after
willie
had
at
length
taught
his
watchman
his
duty
mr
macmichael
did
come
upon
the
mill
and
was
just
going
to
turn
the
water
off
at
the
well
which
he
thought
willie
had
forgotten
to
do
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
winding
thread
for
the
moon
was
full
and
the
doctor
was
what
this
be
now
he
said
to
himself
some
new
freak
of
willie
of
course
yes
the
thread
goes
right
up
to
his
window
i
dare
say
if
i
were
to
stop
and
watch
i
should
see
something
happen
in
consequence
but
i
am
too
tired
and
must
go
to
bed
just
as
he
thought
thus
with
himself
the
wheel
stopped
the
next
moment
the
blind
of
willie
window
was
drawn
up
and
there
stood
willie
his
face
and
his
white
gown
glimmering
in
the
moonlight
he
caught
sight
of
his
father
and
up
went
the
sash
o
papa
he
cried
i
did
think
it
was
you
i
was
going
to
see
who
was
it
then
you
thought
to
see
asked
his
father
oh
nobody
only
the
night
herself
and
the
moon
perhaps
what
new
freak
of
yours
is
this
my
boy
said
his
father
smiling
wait
a
minute
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
answered
willie
out
he
came
in
his
his
bare
feet
dancing
with
pleasure
at
having
his
father
for
his
midnight
companion
on
the
grass
beside
the
ruins
in
the
moonlight
by
the
gurgling
water
he
told
him
all
about
it
yes
my
boy
you
are
right
said
his
father
god
never
sleeps
and
it
would
be
a
pity
if
we
never
saw
him
at
his
illustration
on
the
grass
beside
the
ruins
in
the
moonlight
willie
told
his
father
all
about
it
chapter
xi
some
of
the
sights
willie
saw
i
fancy
some
of
my
readers
would
like
to
hear
what
were
some
of
the
scenes
willie
saw
on
such
occasions
the
little
mill
went
on
night
after
night
almost
everynight
in
the
summer
and
those
nights
in
the
winter
when
the
frost
was
so
hard
that
it
would
have
frozen
up
the
machinery
but
to
attempt
to
describe
the
variety
of
the
pictures
willie
saw
would
be
an
endless
labour
sometimes
when
he
looked
out
it
was
a
simple
quiet
thoughtful
night
that
met
his
gaze
without
any
moon
but
as
full
of
stars
as
it
could
hold
all
flashing
and
trembling
through
the
dew
that
was
slowly
sinking
down
the
air
to
settle
upon
the
earth
and
its
thousand
living
things
below
on
such
a
night
willie
never
went
to
bed
again
without
wishing
to
be
pure
in
heart
that
he
might
one
day
see
the
god
whose
thought
had
taken
the
shape
of
such
a
lovely
night
for
although
he
could
not
have
expressed
himself
thus
at
that
time
he
felt
that
it
must
be
thinking
that
put
it
all
there
other
times
the
stars
would
be
half
blotted
out
all
over
the
heavens
not
with
mist
but
with
the
light
of
the
moon
oh
how
lovely
she
was
so
calm
so
all
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
great
blue
ocean
the
sun
of
the
night
she
seemed
to
hold
up
the
tent
of
the
heavens
in
a
great
silver
knot
and
like
the
stars
above
all
the
flowers
below
had
lost
their
colour
and
looked
pale
and
wan
sweet
and
sad
it
was
just
like
what
the
schoolmaster
had
been
telling
him
about
the
elysium
of
the
greek
and
latin
poets
to
which
they
fancied
the
good
people
went
when
they
died
not
half
so
glad
and
bright
and
busy
as
the
daylight
world
which
they
had
left
behind
them
and
to
which
they
always
wanted
to
go
back
that
they
might
eat
and
drink
and
be
merry
again
but
oh
so
tender
and
lovely
in
its
mournfulness
several
times
in
winter
looking
out
he
saw
a
strange
sight
the
air
so
full
of
great
snowflakes
that
he
could
not
see
the
moon
through
them
although
her
light
was
visible
all
about
them
they
came
floating
slowly
down
through
the
dusky
light
just
as
if
they
had
been
a
precipitate
from
that
solution
of
moonbeams
he
could
hardly
persuade
himself
to
go
to
bed
so
fascinating
was
the
sight
but
the
cold
would
drive
him
to
his
nest
again
once
the
pulled
him
up
in
the
midst
of
a
terrible
when
the
east
and
the
west
were
answering
each
other
with
alternate
flashes
of
forked
lightning
that
seemed
to
split
the
black
clouds
with
cracks
of
blinding
blue
awful
in
their
blasting
silence
followed
by
great
billowy
shattering
rolls
of
thunder
as
loud
as
if
the
sky
had
been
a
huge
kettledrum
on
which
the
clubs
of
giant
drummers
were
beating
a
terrible
onset
while
at
sudden
intervals
down
came
the
rain
pattering
to
the
earth
as
if
beaten
out
of
the
clouds
by
the
blows
of
the
thunder
but
willie
was
not
frightened
though
the
lightning
blinded
and
the
thunder
deafened
him
not
frightened
any
more
than
the
tiniest
flower
in
the
garden
below
which
if
she
could
have
thought
about
it
would
have
thought
it
all
being
done
only
that
she
might
feel
cooler
and
stronger
and
be
able
to
hold
up
her
head
better
and
once
he
saw
a
glorious
dance
of
the
aurora
borealis
in
all
the
colours
of
a
faint
rainbow
the
frosty
snow
sparkled
underneath
and
the
cold
stars
of
winter
sparkled
above
and
between
the
snow
and
the
stars
shimmered
and
shifted
vanished
and
came
again
a
serried
host
of
spears
willie
had
been
reading
the
paradise
lost
and
the
part
which
pleased
him
the
most
was
the
wars
of
the
angels
in
the
sixth
book
hence
it
came
that
the
aurora
looked
to
him
like
the
crowding
of
innumerable
spears
in
the
hands
of
angels
themselves
invisible
clashed
together
and
shaken
asunder
however
as
in
the
convolutions
of
a
mazy
dance
of
victory
rather
than
brandished
and
hurtled
as
in
the
tumult
of
the
battle
another
vision
that
would
greatly
delight
him
was
a
far
more
common
one
the
moon
wading
through
clouds
blown
slowly
across
the
sky
especially
if
by
an
upper
wind
unfelt
below
now
she
would
be
sinking
helpless
in
a
black
faint
growing
more
and
more
dim
until
at
last
she
disappeared
from
the
night
was
blotted
from
the
face
of
nature
leaving
only
a
dim
memorial
light
behind
her
now
her
soul
would
come
into
her
again
and
she
was
there
once
more
doubtful
indeed
but
with
a
slow
solemn
revival
her
light
would
grow
and
grow
until
the
last
fringe
of
the
great
cloud
swung
away
from
off
her
face
and
she
dawned
out
stately
and
glorious
to
float
for
a
space
in
queenly
triumph
across
a
lake
of
clearest
blue
and
willie
was
philosopher
enough
to
say
to
himself
that
all
this
fainting
and
reviving
all
this
defeat
and
conquest
were
but
appearances
that
the
moon
was
her
own
bright
self
all
the
time
basking
contented
in
the
light
of
her
sun
between
whom
and
her
the
cloud
could
not
creep
only
between
her
and
willie
but
what
delighted
him
most
of
all
was
to
catch
the
moon
dreaming
that
was
when
the
old
moon
tumbled
over
on
her
back
would
come
floating
up
the
east
like
a
little
boat
on
the
rising
tide
of
the
night
looking
lost
on
the
infinite
sea
dreaming
she
must
be
surely
she
looked
nothing
but
dreaming
for
she
seemed
to
care
about
nothing
not
even
that
she
was
old
and
worn
and
withered
and
dying
not
even
that
instead
of
sinking
down
in
the
west
into
some
deep
bed
of
dim
repose
she
was
drifting
haggard
and
battered
untidy
and
weak
and
sleepy
up
and
up
into
the
dazzling
halls
of
the
sun
did
she
know
that
his
light
would
clothe
her
as
with
a
garment
and
hide
her
in
the
highest
recesses
of
his
ceiling
or
was
it
only
that
she
was
dreaming
dreaming
sweet
cool
tender
dreams
of
her
own
and
neither
knew
nor
cared
about
anything
around
her
what
a
strange
look
all
the
night
wore
while
the
tired
old
moon
was
thus
dreaming
of
the
time
when
she
would
come
again
back
through
the
vanishing
and
the
darkness
a
single
curved
thread
of
a
baby
moon
to
grow
and
grow
to
a
great
lady
moon
able
to
cross
with
fearless
gaze
the
gulf
of
the
vaulted
heavens
alone
with
neither
sleep
nor
dreams
to
protect
her
there
were
many
other
nights
far
more
commonplace
which
yet
willie
liked
well
to
look
out
upon
but
which
could
not
keep
him
long
from
his
bed
there
was
for
instance
the
moonless
and
cloudy
night
when
if
he
had
been
able
to
pierce
the
darkness
to
the
core
he
would
have
found
nothing
but
blackness
it
had
a
power
of
its
own
but
one
can
not
say
it
had
much
to
look
at
on
such
a
night
he
would
say
to
himself
that
the
day
was
so
sound
asleep
he
was
dreaming
of
nothing
at
all
and
make
haste
to
his
nest
then
again
there
was
the
cold
night
of
black
frost
when
there
was
cloud
enough
to
hide
the
stars
and
the
moon
and
yet
a
little
light
came
soaking
through
enough
to
reveal
how
hopeless
and
dreary
the
earth
was
for
in
such
nights
of
cold
when
there
is
no
snow
to
cover
them
the
flowers
that
have
crept
into
their
roots
to
hide
from
the
winter
are
not
even
able
to
dream
of
the
spring
they
grow
quite
stupid
and
benumbed
and
sleep
outright
like
a
polar
bear
or
a
dormouse
he
never
could
look
long
at
such
a
night
neither
did
he
care
to
look
long
when
a
loud
wind
was
out
except
the
moon
was
bright
for
the
most
he
could
distinguish
was
the
trees
blowing
against
the
sky
and
they
always
seemed
not
to
like
it
and
to
want
to
stop
and
if
the
big
strong
trees
did
not
like
it
how
could
the
poor
little
delicate
flowers
shivering
and
shaking
and
tossed
to
and
fro
if
he
could
have
seen
the
wind
itself
it
would
have
been
a
different
thing
but
as
it
was
he
could
enjoy
it
more
by
lying
in
bed
and
listening
to
it
then
as
he
listened
he
could
fancy
himself
floating
out
through
miles
and
miles
of
night
and
wind
and
or
moony
snowflakes
or
even
thick
darkness
and
rain
until
falling
asleep
in
the
middle
of
his
fancy
it
would
thicken
around
him
into
a
dream
of
delight
once
there
was
to
be
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
about
two
in
the
morning
it
a
pity
it
so
late
or
rather
so
early
said
mr
macmichael
you
willie
wo
be
able
to
see
it
oh
yes
i
shall
father
answered
willie
i
ca
let
you
sit
up
so
late
i
shall
be
in
the
middle
of
sedgy
moor
most
likely
when
it
begins
and
who
is
to
wake
you
i
wo
have
your
mother
disturbed
and
tibby
not
much
to
depend
upon
she
too
to
wake
when
she
likes
poor
old
thing
oh
i
can
be
woke
without
anybody
to
do
it
said
willie
you
do
mean
you
can
depend
on
your
to
wake
you
at
the
right
time
do
you
yes
i
do
father
if
you
will
tell
me
exactly
when
the
eclipse
is
going
to
begin
i
will
set
my
wakener
so
that
it
shall
wake
me
a
before
that
i
may
be
sure
of
seeing
the
very
first
of
it
well
it
will
be
worth
something
to
you
if
it
can
do
that
said
mr
macmichael
it
been
worth
a
great
deal
to
me
already
said
willie
it
would
have
shown
me
an
eclipse
before
now
only
there
has
been
one
since
i
set
it
going
and
wake
him
it
did
while
his
father
was
riding
across
the
moor
in
the
strange
hush
of
the
blotted
moon
willie
was
out
in
the
garden
beside
his
motionless
wheel
watching
the
fell
shadow
of
the
earth
passing
over
the
blessed
face
of
the
moon
and
leaving
her
pure
and
clear
and
nothing
the
worse
chapter
xii
a
new
scheme
i
have
said
that
willie
father
and
mother
used
to
talk
without
restraint
in
his
presence
they
had
no
fear
of
willie
committing
an
indiscretion
by
repeating
what
he
heard
one
day
at
dinner
the
following
conversation
took
place
between
them
i
had
a
letter
from
my
mother
john
said
mrs
macmichael
to
her
husband
it
wonderful
how
well
she
manages
to
write
when
she
sees
so
badly
she
might
see
well
enough
at
least
a
great
deal
better
if
she
would
submit
to
an
operation
said
the
doctor
at
age
john
returned
his
wife
in
an
expostulatory
tone
do
you
really
think
it
worth
while
for
the
few
years
that
are
left
her
worth
while
to
see
well
for
a
few
years
exclaimed
the
doctor
indeed
i
do
but
there
another
thing
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
now
said
mrs
macmichael
since
old
ann
death
six
months
ago
she
says
she
has
been
miserable
and
if
she
goes
on
like
this
it
will
shorten
the
few
days
that
are
left
her
effie
the
only
endurable
servant
she
has
had
since
ann
is
going
to
leave
at
the
end
of
her
and
she
says
the
thought
of
another
makes
her
wretched
she
may
be
a
little
hard
to
please
but
after
being
used
to
one
for
so
many
years
it
is
no
wonder
if
she
be
particular
i
do
know
what
is
to
be
done
i
do
know
either
except
you
make
her
a
present
of
tibby
said
her
husband
john
exclaimed
mrs
macmichael
and
john
burst
out
laughing
you
do
think
they
pull
together
he
said
two
old
people
each
with
her
own
ways
and
without
any
memories
in
common
to
bind
them
together
i
surprised
at
your
dreaming
of
such
a
thing
exclaimed
his
wife
but
i
did
even
dream
of
it
i
only
said
it
returned
her
husband
it
time
you
knew
when
i
was
joking
wifie
you
joke
so
dreadfully
like
earnest
she
answered
if
only
we
had
one
more
room
in
the
house
said
the
doctor
thoughtfully
ah
returned
his
wife
eagerly
that
would
be
a
blessing
and
though
tibby
would
be
a
thorn
in
every
inch
of
grandmamma
body
if
they
were
alone
together
i
have
no
doubt
they
would
get
on
very
well
with
me
between
them
i
do
doubt
it
said
her
husband
still
thoughtfully
could
we
manage
it
somehow
john
said
mrs
macmichael
half
timidly
after
a
pause
of
some
duration
i
ca
say
i
see
how
at
this
moment
answered
the
doctor
much
as
i
should
like
it
but
there
time
yet
and
we
think
it
over
and
talk
about
it
and
perhaps
we
may
hit
upon
some
plan
or
other
most
things
be
done
and
everything
necessary
be
done
so
we
wo
bother
our
minds
about
it
but
only
our
brains
and
see
what
they
can
do
for
us
with
this
he
rose
and
went
to
his
laboratory
willie
rose
also
and
went
straight
to
his
own
room
having
looked
all
round
it
thoughtfully
several
times
he
went
out
again
on
the
landing
whence
a
ladder
led
up
into
a
garret
running
the
whole
length
of
the
roof
of
the
cottage
my
room
would
do
for
grannie
he
said
to
himself
and
i
could
sleep
up
there
a
in
the
corner
would
do
well
enough
for
me
he
climbed
the
ladder
pushed
open
the
crept
half
through
and
surveyed
the
gloomy
place
there
no
window
but
a
skylight
he
said
and
his
eyes
smarted
as
if
the
tears
were
about
to
rush
into
them
what
i
do
wheelie
will
be
useless
well
i
ca
help
it
and
if
i
ca
help
it
i
can
bear
it
to
have
grannie
comfortable
will
be
better
than
to
look
out
of
the
window
ever
so
much
he
drew
in
his
head
came
down
the
ladder
with
a
rush
and
hurried
off
to
school
at
supper
he
laid
his
scheme
before
his
father
and
mother
they
looked
very
much
pleased
with
their
boy
but
his
father
said
at
once
no
no
willie
it
wo
do
i
glad
you
been
the
first
to
think
of
something
only
unfortunately
your
plan
wo
work
you
ca
sleep
there
i
engage
to
sleep
wherever
there
room
to
lie
down
and
if
there
is
i
engage
to
sleep
sitting
or
standing
said
willie
whose
mother
had
often
said
she
wished
she
could
sleep
like
willie
and
as
i
do
walk
in
my
sleep
he
added
the
need
be
shut
mice
willie
said
his
mother
in
a
tone
of
much
significance
the
cat
and
i
are
good
friends
returned
willie
she
be
pleased
enough
to
sleep
with
me
you
do
hit
the
thing
at
all
said
his
father
i
wonder
a
practical
man
like
you
willie
does
see
it
at
once
even
if
i
were
at
the
expense
of
ceiling
the
whole
roof
with
lath
and
plaster
we
should
find
you
some
morning
in
summer
baked
black
as
a
coal
or
else
some
morning
in
winter
frozen
so
stiff
that
when
we
tried
to
lift
you
your
arm
snapped
off
like
a
dry
twig
of
elder
ho
ho
ho
laughed
willie
then
there
would
be
the
more
room
for
grannie
his
father
laughed
with
him
but
his
mother
looked
a
little
shocked
no
willie
said
his
father
again
you
must
make
another
attempt
you
must
say
with
hamlet
when
he
was
puzzled
for
a
plan
my
brains
perhaps
they
will
suggest
something
wiser
next
time
willie
lay
so
long
awake
that
night
thinking
that
pulled
him
before
he
had
had
a
wink
of
sleep
he
got
up
of
course
and
looked
from
the
window
the
day
was
dreaming
grandly
the
sky
was
pretty
clear
in
front
and
full
of
sparkles
of
light
for
the
stars
were
kept
in
the
background
by
the
moon
which
was
down
a
little
towards
the
west
she
had
sunk
below
the
top
of
a
huge
towering
cloud
the
edges
of
whose
jags
and
pinnacles
she
bordered
with
a
line
of
silvery
light
now
this
cloud
rose
into
the
sky
from
just
behind
the
ruins
and
looking
a
good
deal
like
upheaved
towers
and
spires
made
willie
think
within
himself
what
a
grand
place
the
priory
must
have
been
when
its
roofs
and
turrets
rose
up
into
the
sky
they
say
a
lot
of
people
lived
in
it
then
he
thought
with
himself
as
he
stood
gazing
at
the
cloud
suddenly
he
gave
a
great
jump
and
clapped
his
hands
so
loud
that
he
woke
his
father
is
anything
the
matter
my
boy
he
asked
opening
willie
door
and
peeping
in
no
papa
nothing
answered
willie
only
something
that
came
into
my
head
with
a
great
bounce
ah
where
did
it
come
from
willie
out
of
that
cloud
there
is
it
a
grand
one
grand
enough
certainly
to
put
many
thoughts
into
a
body
head
willie
what
did
it
put
into
yours
please
i
would
rather
not
tell
just
yet
answered
willie
if
you
do
mind
father
not
a
bit
my
boy
tell
me
just
when
you
please
or
do
tell
me
at
all
i
should
like
to
hear
it
but
only
at
your
pleasure
willie
thank
you
father
i
do
want
to
tell
you
you
know
but
not
just
yet
very
well
my
boy
now
go
to
bed
and
sleep
may
better
the
thought
before
the
morning
willie
soon
fell
asleep
now
for
he
believed
he
had
found
what
he
wanted
he
was
up
earlier
than
usual
the
next
morning
and
out
in
the
garden
surely
he
said
to
himself
those
ruins
which
once
held
so
many
monks
might
manage
even
yet
to
find
room
for
me
he
went
wandering
about
amongst
them
like
an
undecided
young
bird
looking
for
the
very
best
possible
spot
to
build
its
nest
in
the
spot
willie
sought
was
that
which
would
require
the
least
labour
and
least
material
to
make
it
into
a
room
before
he
heard
the
voice
of
tibby
calling
him
to
come
to
his
porridge
he
had
fixed
upon
one
and
in
the
following
chapter
i
will
tell
you
what
led
him
to
choose
it
all
the
time
between
morning
and
afternoon
school
he
spent
in
the
same
place
and
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
he
was
accompanied
by
mr
spelman
who
went
with
him
straight
to
the
ruins
there
they
were
a
good
while
together
and
when
willie
at
length
came
in
his
mother
saw
that
his
face
was
more
than
usually
radiant
and
was
certain
he
had
some
new
scheme
or
other
in
his
head
chapter
xiii
willie
nest
in
the
ruins
the
spot
he
had
fixed
upon
was
in
the
part
of
the
ruins
next
the
cottage
not
many
yards
from
the
back
door
of
it
i
have
said
there
were
still
a
few
vaulted
places
on
the
used
by
the
family
the
vault
over
the
was
perfectly
sound
and
and
therefore
as
willie
and
the
carpenter
agreed
quite
safe
to
roost
upon
in
a
corner
outside
and
now
open
to
the
elements
had
once
been
a
small
winding
stone
stair
which
led
to
the
room
above
on
the
few
broken
fragments
of
which
projecting
from
the
two
sides
of
the
corner
it
was
just
possible
to
climb
and
so
reach
the
top
of
the
vault
willie
had
often
got
up
to
look
out
through
a
small
window
into
the
garden
of
the
manse
when
mr
shepherd
the
clergyman
who
often
walked
in
his
garden
caught
sight
of
him
he
always
came
nearer
and
had
a
chat
with
him
for
he
did
not
mind
such
people
as
willie
looking
into
his
garden
and
seeing
what
he
was
about
sometimes
also
little
mona
a
girl
of
his
own
age
would
be
running
about
and
she
also
if
she
caught
sight
of
willie
was
sure
to
come
hopping
and
skipping
like
a
bird
to
have
a
talk
with
him
and
beg
him
to
take
her
up
which
he
as
often
assured
her
was
all
but
impossible
to
this
place
mr
spelman
and
willie
climbed
and
there
held
consultation
whether
and
how
it
could
be
made
habitable
the
main
difficulty
was
how
to
cover
it
in
for
although
the
walls
were
quite
sound
a
long
way
up
it
lay
open
to
the
sky
but
about
ten
feet
over
their
heads
they
saw
the
opposing
holes
in
two
of
the
walls
where
the
joists
formerly
sustaining
the
floor
of
the
chamber
above
had
rested
and
mr
spelman
thought
that
without
any
very
large
outlay
either
of
time
or
material
he
could
there
lay
a
floor
as
it
were
and
then
turn
it
into
a
roof
by
covering
it
with
cement
or
pitch
or
something
of
the
sort
concerning
which
he
would
take
counsel
with
his
friend
mortimer
the
mason
but
said
willie
that
would
turn
it
into
the
bottom
of
a
cistern
for
the
walls
above
would
hold
the
rain
in
and
what
would
happen
then
either
it
must
gather
till
it
reached
the
top
or
the
weight
of
it
would
burst
the
walls
or
perhaps
break
through
my
roof
and
drown
me
it
is
easy
to
avoid
that
said
mr
spelman
we
have
only
to
lay
on
the
cement
a
little
thicker
at
one
side
and
slope
the
surface
down
to
the
other
where
a
hole
through
the
wall
with
a
pipe
in
it
would
let
the
water
off
i
know
cried
willie
that
what
they
called
a
gurgoyle
i
do
know
anything
about
that
said
the
carpenter
i
know
it
will
carry
off
the
water
to
be
sure
said
willie
it
capital
but
said
mr
spelman
it
rather
too
serious
a
job
this
to
set
about
before
asking
the
doctor
leave
it
will
cost
money
much
asked
willie
whose
heart
sank
within
him
well
that
depends
on
what
you
count
much
answered
spelman
all
i
can
say
is
it
would
be
anything
out
of
your
father
pocket
i
do
see
how
that
can
be
said
cost
money
and
yet
be
nothing
out
of
my
father
pocket
only
got
threepence
your
father
and
i
will
talk
about
it
said
the
carpenter
mysteriously
and
offered
no
further
information
there
seems
to
be
always
some
way
of
doing
a
thing
thought
willie
to
himself
he
little
knew
by
what
a
roundabout
succession
of
cause
and
effect
his
father
kindness
to
spelman
was
at
this
moment
returning
to
him
one
of
the
links
of
connection
being
this
project
of
willie
own
the
doctor
being
out
at
the
time
the
carpenter
called
again
later
in
the
evening
and
they
had
a
long
talk
together
to
the
following
effect
spelman
having
set
forth
his
scheme
and
the
doctor
having
listened
in
silence
until
he
had
finished
but
said
mr
macmichael
that
will
cost
a
good
deal
i
fear
and
i
have
no
money
to
spare
mr
macmichael
said
spelman
solemnly
his
long
face
looking
as
if
some
awful
doom
were
about
to
issue
from
the
middle
of
it
you
forget
how
much
i
am
in
your
debt
no
i
do
returned
the
doctor
but
neither
do
i
forget
that
it
takes
all
your
time
and
labour
to
provide
for
your
family
and
what
will
become
of
them
if
you
set
about
this
job
with
no
return
in
prospect
but
the
satisfaction
of
clearing
off
of
an
old
debt
it
is
very
good
of
you
sir
to
think
of
that
said
the
carpenter
but
begging
your
pardon
i
thought
of
it
too
many
the
time
you
come
after
what
i
ha
called
work
hours
to
see
my
wife
yes
in
the
middle
of
the
night
more
than
once
or
twice
and
why
should
i
do
the
same
look
ye
here
sir
if
you
not
in
a
main
hurry
an
give
me
time
i
do
the
heavy
work
o
this
job
after
six
o
the
summer
nights
with
sandy
to
help
me
and
i
charge
you
no
more
than
a
journeyman
wages
by
the
hour
and
what
willie
and
sandy
can
do
by
themselves
he
a
clever
boy
sandy
but
he
a
genius
willie
what
they
can
do
by
themselves
and
that
not
a
little
is
nothing
to
me
and
if
you
have
the
goodness
when
i
give
you
the
honest
time
at
fourpence
an
hour
just
to
strike
that
much
off
my
bill
i
be
more
obliged
to
you
than
i
am
now
only
i
fear
i
must
make
you
pay
for
the
material
not
a
farthing
more
than
it
costs
me
at
the
up
at
the
grange
for
the
carriage
come
in
with
other
lots
i
have
it
a
generous
offer
spelman
said
the
doctor
and
i
accept
it
heartily
though
you
are
turning
the
tables
of
obligation
upon
me
you
have
done
far
more
for
me
than
i
ever
did
for
you
i
wish
that
were
like
to
be
true
sir
but
it
is
my
wife
not
a
giantess
yet
for
all
you
done
for
her
spelman
set
to
work
at
once
new
joists
were
inserted
in
the
old
walls
boarded
over
and
covered
after
the
advice
of
mortimer
with
some
cunning
mixture
to
keep
out
the
water
then
a
pipe
was
put
through
the
wall
to
carry
it
off
which
pipe
if
it
was
not
masked
with
an
awful
head
as
the
remains
of
more
than
one
on
the
priory
showed
it
would
have
been
in
the
days
of
the
monks
yet
did
it
work
as
faithfully
without
it
when
it
came
to
the
plastering
of
the
walls
mr
spelman
after
giving
them
full
directions
left
the
two
boys
to
do
that
between
them
although
there
was
no
occasion
to
roughen
these
walls
by
clearing
away
the
old
mortar
from
between
the
stones
the
weather
having
done
that
quite
sufficiently
and
all
the
preparation
they
wanted
for
the
first
thin
coat
was
to
be
well
washed
down
it
took
them
a
good
many
days
working
all
their
time
to
lay
on
the
orthodox
three
coats
of
plaster
mr
spelman
had
wisely
boarded
the
ceiling
so
that
they
had
not
to
plaster
that
meantime
he
was
preparing
a
door
and
in
the
shop
the
room
had
probably
been
one
of
the
prior
for
it
was
much
too
large
and
lofty
for
a
mere
cell
and
had
two
windows
but
these
were
fortunately
small
not
like
the
splendid
ones
in
the
chapel
and
refectory
else
they
would
have
been
hard
to
fill
with
glass
i
afraid
you
be
starved
with
cold
willie
said
his
father
one
day
after
watching
the
boys
at
work
for
a
few
minutes
there
no
fireplace
oh
that
does
signify
answered
willie
look
how
thick
the
walls
are
and
i
shall
have
plenty
of
blankets
on
my
bed
besides
we
can
easily
put
a
little
stove
in
if
it
wanted
but
when
the
windows
were
fitted
and
fixed
mr
macmichael
saw
to
his
dismay
that
they
were
not
made
to
open
they
had
not
even
a
pane
on
hinges
this
never
do
willie
he
said
this
is
far
worse
than
no
chimney
willie
took
his
father
by
the
coat
and
led
him
to
a
corner
where
a
hole
went
right
through
the
wall
into
another
room
if
that
can
be
called
a
room
which
had
neither
floor
nor
ceiling
there
father
he
said
i
am
going
to
fit
a
slide
over
this
hole
and
then
i
can
let
in
just
as
much
or
as
little
air
as
i
please
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
one
at
least
of
the
windows
made
to
open
you
will
only
get
the
air
from
the
ruins
that
way
whereas
you
might
have
had
all
the
scents
of
mr
shepherd
wallflowers
and
roses
as
soon
as
mr
spelman
has
done
with
the
job
said
willie
i
will
make
them
both
to
come
wide
open
on
hinges
but
i
do
want
to
bother
him
about
it
for
he
has
been
very
kind
and
i
can
do
it
quite
well
myself
this
satisfied
his
father
at
length
the
floor
was
boarded
a
strong
thick
door
was
fitted
tight
a
winding
stair
of
deal
inserted
where
the
stone
one
had
been
and
cased
in
with
planks
well
pitched
on
the
outside
and
now
willie
mother
was
busy
making
little
muslin
curtains
for
his
windows
and
a
carpet
for
the
middle
of
the
room
in
the
meantime
his
father
and
mother
had
both
written
to
his
grandmother
telling
her
how
willie
had
been
using
his
powers
both
of
invention
and
of
labour
to
make
room
for
her
and
urging
her
to
come
and
live
with
them
for
they
were
all
anxious
to
have
her
to
take
care
of
but
in
fact
small
persuasion
was
necessary
for
the
old
lady
was
only
too
glad
to
accept
the
invitation
and
before
the
warm
weather
of
autumn
was
over
she
was
ready
to
go
to
them
by
this
time
willie
room
was
furnished
all
the
things
from
his
former
nest
had
been
moved
into
it
the
bed
with
the
chintz
curtains
covered
with
strange
flowers
and
birds
the
old
bureau
with
the
many
drawers
inside
the
folding
cover
in
which
he
kept
all
his
little
treasures
the
table
at
which
he
read
books
that
were
too
big
to
hold
such
as
raleigh
history
of
the
world
and
josephus
the
old
oblong
mirror
that
hung
on
the
wall
with
an
outspread
gilt
eagle
at
the
top
of
it
the
big
old
that
had
belonged
to
his
who
wrote
his
sermons
in
it
for
all
the
things
the
boy
had
about
him
were
old
and
in
all
his
he
never
could
bear
new
furniture
and
now
his
grandmother
furniture
began
to
appear
and
a
great
of
it
from
her
best
bedroom
was
speedily
arranged
in
willie
late
quarters
and
as
soon
as
they
were
ready
for
her
mrs
macmichael
set
out
in
a
to
fetch
her
mother
chapter
xiv
willie
grandmother
willie
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
until
she
arrived
looking
for
her
as
eagerly
as
if
she
had
been
a
young
princess
so
few
were
the
opportunities
of
travelling
between
priory
leas
and
the
town
where
his
grandmother
lived
that
he
had
never
seen
her
and
curiosity
had
its
influence
as
well
as
affection
great
therefore
was
his
delight
when
at
last
the
chaise
came
round
the
corner
of
the
street
and
began
to
draw
up
in
order
to
halt
at
their
door
the
first
thing
he
caught
sight
of
was
a
curious
bonnet
like
a
black
upside
down
inside
which
when
it
turned
its
front
towards
him
he
saw
a
widow
cap
and
inside
that
a
kind
old
face
and
if
he
could
have
looked
still
further
he
would
have
seen
a
kind
young
soul
inside
the
kind
old
face
she
smiled
sweetly
when
she
saw
him
but
was
too
tired
to
take
any
further
notice
of
him
until
she
had
had
tea
during
that
meal
willie
devoted
himself
to
a
silent
waiting
upon
her
watching
and
trying
to
anticipate
her
every
want
when
she
had
eaten
a
little
bread
and
butter
and
an
egg
and
drunk
two
cups
of
tea
she
lay
back
in
her
own
easy
chair
which
had
been
placed
for
her
by
the
side
of
the
parlour
fire
and
fell
fast
asleep
for
ten
minutes
breathing
so
gently
that
willie
got
frightened
and
thought
she
was
dead
but
all
at
once
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
and
made
a
sign
to
him
to
come
to
her
sit
down
there
she
said
pushing
a
little
footstool
towards
him
willie
obeyed
and
sat
looking
up
in
her
face
so
she
said
you
the
little
man
that
can
do
everything
no
grannie
answered
willie
laughing
i
wish
i
could
but
i
am
only
learning
to
do
a
few
things
and
there
not
one
of
them
i
can
do
right
yet
do
you
know
what
they
call
you
the
boys
at
school
call
me
jack
said
willie
there
said
his
grandmother
i
told
you
so
i
glad
it
only
a
nickname
grannie
but
if
it
were
it
would
soon
be
one
for
i
certain
the
finger
that
came
after
the
little
one
would
be
so
much
in
the
way
it
would
soon
get
cut
off
anyhow
supposing
you
only
half
as
clever
a
fellow
as
you
pass
for
i
want
to
try
you
have
you
any
objection
to
service
i
should
like
to
hire
you
for
my
servant
my
own
special
servant
you
understand
all
right
grannie
here
i
am
cried
willie
jumping
up
what
shall
i
do
first
sit
down
again
instantly
and
wait
till
we
finished
the
bargain
i
must
first
have
you
understand
that
though
i
do
want
to
be
hard
upon
you
you
must
come
when
i
call
you
and
do
what
i
tell
you
of
course
grannie
only
i
ca
when
i
at
school
you
know
i
do
want
to
be
told
that
and
i
not
going
to
be
a
tyrant
but
i
had
no
idea
you
were
such
a
silly
for
all
your
cleverness
positively
never
asked
me
what
wages
i
would
give
you
oh
i
do
want
any
wages
grannie
i
to
do
things
for
people
and
you
my
very
own
grandmother
besides
you
know
well
i
suppose
i
must
settle
your
wages
for
you
i
mean
to
pay
you
by
the
job
it
an
odd
arrangement
for
a
servant
but
it
will
suit
me
best
and
as
you
do
ask
any
i
need
pay
you
more
than
i
like
myself
certainly
not
grannie
i
quite
satisfied
meantime
no
engagement
of
a
servant
ought
to
be
counted
complete
without
earnest
i
quite
in
earnest
grannie
said
willie
who
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
his
new
mistress
used
it
they
all
laughed
i
do
see
what
funny
said
willie
laughing
too
however
but
when
they
explained
to
him
what
meant
then
he
laughed
with
understanding
as
well
as
with
good
will
so
his
grandmother
went
on
i
will
give
you
earnest
which
you
know
binds
you
my
servant
but
for
how
long
willie
till
you
tired
of
me
grannie
only
you
know
i
papa
and
servant
first
and
you
may
have
to
arrange
with
them
sometimes
for
what
should
i
do
if
you
were
all
to
want
me
at
once
we
easily
manage
that
i
arrange
with
them
as
you
say
and
now
here
your
earnest
as
she
spoke
she
put
into
his
hand
what
willie
took
to
be
a
shilling
but
when
he
glanced
at
it
he
found
himself
mistaken
thank
you
grannie
he
said
trying
not
to
show
himself
a
little
disappointed
for
he
had
had
another
scheme
in
his
head
some
days
and
the
shilling
would
have
been
everything
towards
that
do
you
know
what
grannie
has
given
you
willie
said
his
mother
yes
mother
such
a
pretty
brass
medal
show
it
me
dear
why
willie
it
no
brass
medal
child
it
a
sovereign
is
it
o
grannie
he
cried
and
went
dancing
about
the
room
as
if
he
would
actually
fly
with
delight
willie
had
never
seen
a
sovereign
for
that
part
of
the
country
was
then
like
holland
you
never
saw
gold
money
there
to
get
it
for
him
his
grandmother
had
had
to
send
to
the
bank
in
the
county
town
after
this
she
would
often
give
him
sixpence
or
a
shilling
and
sometimes
even
a
when
she
asked
him
to
do
anything
she
thought
a
little
harder
than
usual
so
that
willie
had
now
plenty
of
money
with
which
to
carry
out
his
little
plans
when
remonstrated
with
by
her
daughter
for
giving
him
so
much
his
grandmother
would
say
look
how
the
boy
spends
it
always
something
with
it
he
never
wastes
it
on
sweets
not
he
my
willie
above
that
the
old
lady
generally
spoke
of
him
as
if
she
were
the
chief
if
not
the
sole
proprietor
of
the
boy
i
sure
i
could
do
better
with
it
she
would
add
and
that
see
when
he
comes
to
be
a
man
he
be
the
making
of
you
all
but
mother
you
ca
afford
it
how
do
you
know
that
i
can
afford
it
very
well
i
no
to
pay
and
i
am
certain
it
is
the
very
best
return
i
can
make
you
for
your
kindness
what
i
do
for
willie
will
prove
to
have
been
done
for
us
all
certainly
willie
grandmother
showed
herself
a
very
wise
old
lady
the
wisest
old
ladies
are
always
those
with
young
souls
looking
out
of
their
eyes
and
few
things
pleased
willie
more
than
waiting
upon
her
he
had
a
passion
for
being
useful
and
as
his
grandmother
needed
his
help
more
than
any
one
else
her
presence
in
the
house
was
an
endless
source
of
pleasure
to
him
but
his
father
grew
anxious
he
did
not
like
her
giving
willie
so
much
money
not
that
he
minded
willie
having
or
spending
the
money
for
he
believed
that
the
spending
would
keep
the
having
from
hurting
him
but
he
feared
lest
through
her
gifts
the
purity
of
the
boy
love
for
his
grandmother
might
be
injured
and
the
service
which
at
first
had
looked
only
to
her
as
its
end
might
degenerate
into
a
mere
serving
of
her
for
the
sake
of
her
shillings
he
had
therefore
a
long
talk
with
her
about
it
she
was
indignant
at
the
notion
of
the
least
danger
of
spoiling
willie
but
so
anxious
to
prove
there
was
none
that
she
agreed
to
the
test
proposed
by
his
father
which
was
to
drop
all
money
transactions
between
them
for
a
few
months
giving
willie
no
reason
for
the
change
grannie
however
being
in
word
and
manner
if
possible
still
kinder
to
him
than
ever
and
no
wonder
seeing
she
could
no
more
for
the
present
let
her
love
out
at
her
and
willie
having
therefore
no
anxiety
lest
he
should
have
displeased
her
he
soon
ceased
to
think
even
of
the
change
except
indeed
sometimes
when
he
wanted
a
little
money
very
much
and
then
he
would
say
to
himself
that
he
was
afraid
poor
grannie
had
been
too
liberal
at
first
and
had
spent
all
her
money
upon
him
therefore
he
must
try
to
be
the
more
attentive
to
her
now
so
the
result
was
satisfactory
and
the
more
so
that
for
all
her
boasting
his
grandmother
had
not
been
able
to
help
trembling
a
little
half
with
annoyance
half
with
anxiety
as
she
let
the
first
few
of
his
services
pass
without
the
customary
acknowledgment
there
she
said
one
day
at
length
triumphantly
to
mr
macmichael
what
do
you
think
of
my
willie
now
three
months
over
and
gone
and
where
are
your
fears
i
hope
you
will
trust
my
judgment
a
little
better
after
this
i
very
glad
anyhow
you
put
him
to
the
trial
said
his
father
it
will
do
him
good
he
wants
less
of
that
than
most
people
mr
macmichael
present
company
excepted
said
the
old
lady
rather
nettled
but
pretending
to
be
more
so
than
she
really
was
chapter
xv
hydraulics
the
first
thing
willie
did
after
getting
his
room
all
to
himself
was
to
put
hinges
on
the
windows
and
make
them
open
so
satisfying
his
father
as
to
the
airiness
of
the
room
finding
himself
then
as
it
were
in
a
house
of
his
own
he
began
to
ask
his
friends
in
the
village
to
come
and
see
him
in
his
new
quarters
the
first
who
did
so
was
mrs
wilson
and
mr
spelman
followed
hector
macallaster
was
unwell
and
it
was
a
month
before
he
was
able
to
go
but
the
first
day
he
could
he
crawled
up
the
hill
to
the
ruins
and
then
up
the
little
winding
stair
to
willie
nest
the
boy
was
delighted
to
see
him
made
him
sit
in
his
great
and
as
the
poor
man
was
very
tired
with
the
exertion
would
have
run
to
the
house
to
get
him
something
but
hector
begged
for
a
little
water
and
declared
he
could
take
nothing
else
therefore
willie
got
a
tumbler
from
his
and
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
hector
hearing
a
splashing
and
rushing
turned
round
to
look
and
saw
him
with
one
hand
in
a
small
wooden
trough
that
ran
along
the
wall
and
with
the
other
holding
the
tumbler
in
a
stream
of
water
that
fell
from
the
side
of
the
trough
into
his
bath
when
the
tumbler
was
full
he
removed
his
hand
from
the
trough
and
the
water
ceased
to
overflow
he
carried
the
tumbler
to
hector
who
drank
and
said
the
water
was
delicious
hector
could
not
imagine
how
the
running
water
had
got
there
and
willie
had
to
tell
him
what
i
am
now
going
to
tell
my
reader
his
sovereign
and
his
own
hydraulics
had
brought
it
there
he
had
been
thinking
for
some
time
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
have
a
stream
running
through
his
room
and
how
much
labour
it
would
save
poor
old
tibbie
for
it
was
no
light
matter
for
her
old
limbs
to
carry
all
the
water
for
his
bath
up
that
steep
narrow
winding
stair
to
his
room
he
reasoned
that
as
the
well
rose
and
overflowed
when
its
outlet
was
stopped
it
might
rise
yet
farther
if
it
were
still
confined
for
its
source
was
probably
in
the
heart
of
one
of
the
surrounding
hills
and
water
when
confined
will
always
rise
as
high
as
its
source
therefore
after
much
meditation
as
to
how
it
could
be
accomplished
in
the
simplest
and
least
expensive
manner
he
set
about
it
as
follows
first
of
all
he
cleared
away
the
floor
about
the
well
and
built
up
the
circular
wall
of
it
a
foot
or
two
higher
with
stones
picked
from
those
lying
about
and
with
mortar
which
he
made
himself
by
means
of
a
he
laid
the
top
layer
of
stones
quite
horizontal
and
he
introduced
into
it
several
blocks
of
wood
instead
of
stones
next
he
made
a
small
wooden
frame
which
by
driving
spikes
between
the
stones
he
fastened
to
the
opening
of
the
underground
passage
so
that
a
piece
of
board
could
move
up
and
down
in
it
by
means
of
a
projecting
handle
and
be
a
more
manageable
sluice
than
he
had
hitherto
had
then
he
made
a
strong
wooden
lid
to
the
mouth
of
the
well
and
screwed
it
down
to
the
wooden
blocks
he
had
built
in
through
a
hole
in
it
just
large
enough
came
the
handle
of
the
sluice
next
in
the
middle
of
the
cover
he
made
a
hole
with
a
brace
and
and
into
it
drove
the
end
of
a
strong
iron
pipe
fitting
tight
and
long
enough
to
reach
almost
to
the
top
of
the
vault
as
soon
as
this
was
fixed
he
shut
down
the
sluice
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
water
was
falling
in
sheets
upon
him
and
flooding
the
floor
dashed
back
from
the
vault
against
which
it
rushed
from
the
top
of
the
pipe
this
was
enough
for
the
present
he
raised
the
sluice
and
let
the
water
escape
again
below
it
was
plain
from
the
force
with
which
the
water
struck
the
vault
that
it
would
yet
rise
much
higher
he
scrambled
now
on
the
top
of
the
vault
and
examining
the
ruins
soon
saw
how
a
pipe
brought
up
through
the
breach
in
the
vault
could
be
led
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
of
his
room
which
he
had
shown
his
father
as
a
ventilator
but
he
would
not
have
a
close
pipe
running
through
his
room
there
would
be
little
good
in
that
he
could
have
made
a
hole
in
it
with
a
stopper
to
let
the
water
out
when
he
wanted
to
use
it
but
that
would
be
awkward
while
all
the
pleasure
lay
in
seeing
the
water
as
it
ran
therefore
he
got
mr
spelman
to
find
him
a
long
small
pine
tree
which
he
first
sawed
in
two
lengthways
and
hollowed
into
two
troughs
then
by
laying
the
small
end
of
one
into
the
wide
end
of
the
other
he
had
a
spout
long
enough
to
reach
across
the
room
and
go
through
the
wall
on
both
sides
the
chief
difficulty
was
to
pierce
the
other
wall
for
the
mortar
was
very
hard
the
stones
however
just
there
were
not
very
large
and
with
sandy
help
he
managed
it
the
large
end
of
one
trough
was
put
through
the
and
the
small
end
of
the
other
through
the
hole
opposite
their
second
ends
met
in
the
middle
the
one
lying
into
the
other
and
were
supported
at
the
juncture
by
a
prop
they
filled
up
the
two
openings
round
the
ends
with
lime
and
small
stones
making
them
as
tidy
as
they
could
and
fitting
small
slides
by
which
willie
could
close
up
the
passages
for
the
water
when
he
pleased
nothing
remained
but
to
solder
a
lead
pipe
into
the
top
of
the
iron
one
guide
this
flexible
tube
across
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
ruins
and
lay
the
end
of
it
into
the
trough
at
length
willie
took
his
stand
at
the
sluice
and
told
sandy
to
scramble
up
to
the
end
of
the
lead
pipe
and
shout
when
the
water
began
to
pour
into
the
trough
his
object
was
to
find
how
far
the
sluice
required
to
be
shut
down
in
order
to
send
up
just
as
much
water
as
the
pipe
could
deliver
more
than
that
would
cause
a
pressure
which
might
strain
and
perhaps
burst
their
apparatus
he
pushed
the
sluice
down
a
little
and
waited
a
moment
is
it
coming
yet
sandy
he
cried
not
a
drop
shouted
sandy
willie
pushed
it
a
little
further
and
then
knew
by
the
change
in
the
gurgle
below
that
the
water
was
rising
in
the
well
and
it
soon
began
to
spout
from
the
hole
in
the
cover
through
which
the
came
up
it
coming
cried
sandy
after
a
pause
not
much
though
down
went
the
sluice
a
little
further
still
it
pouring
echoed
the
voice
of
sandy
amongst
the
ruins
as
much
as
ever
the
pipe
can
give
its
mouth
is
quite
full
willie
raised
the
sluice
a
little
how
is
it
now
he
bawled
less
cried
sandy
so
willie
pushed
it
back
to
where
it
had
been
last
and
made
a
notch
in
the
handle
to
know
the
right
place
again
so
the
water
from
the
prior
well
went
careering
through
a
story
high
when
he
wanted
to
fill
his
bath
he
had
only
to
stop
the
run
with
his
hand
and
it
poured
over
the
sides
into
it
so
that
tibbie
was
to
be
henceforth
relieved
of
a
great
labour
while
willie
eyes
were
to
be
delighted
with
the
vision
and
his
ears
with
the
sounds
of
the
water
scampering
through
his
room
an
hour
or
so
after
as
he
was
finishing
off
something
about
the
mouth
of
the
well
he
heard
his
father
calling
him
willie
willie
he
shouted
is
this
any
more
of
your
kelpie
work
what
is
it
father
cried
willie
as
he
came
bounding
to
him
he
needed
no
reply
when
he
saw
a
great
pool
of
water
about
the
back
door
fed
by
a
small
stream
from
the
direction
of
the
woodhouse
tibbie
had
come
out
and
was
looking
on
in
dismay
that
willie
again
sir
she
was
saying
you
never
can
tell
where
he
be
spouting
that
weary
water
at
you
illustration
tibbie
looking
on
in
dismay
said
that
willie
again
the
whole
place
be
bog
before
long
and
we
be
all
turned
into
frogs
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
croak
that
well
be
the
ruin
of
us
all
with
cold
and
coughs
you
be
glad
enough
of
it
tibbie
said
willie
laughing
prophetically
a
likely
story
she
returned
quite
cross
it
be
into
the
house
if
you
do
stop
it
i
soon
do
that
said
willie
neither
he
nor
sandy
had
thought
what
would
become
of
the
water
after
it
had
traversed
the
chamber
there
it
was
pouring
down
from
the
end
of
the
wooden
spout
just
clearing
the
tarred
roof
of
the
spiral
stair
and
plashing
on
the
ground
close
to
the
foot
of
it
in
their
eagerness
they
had
never
thought
of
where
it
would
run
to
next
and
now
willie
was
puzzled
nothing
was
easier
than
to
stop
it
for
the
present
which
of
course
he
ran
at
once
to
do
but
where
was
he
to
send
it
thinking
over
it
however
he
remembered
that
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
was
the
stable
where
his
father
horses
lived
close
to
the
parson
garden
and
in
the
corner
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
was
a
drain
so
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
fit
another
spout
to
this
at
right
angles
to
it
and
carry
it
over
the
wall
you
need
take
any
water
up
for
me
tonight
tibby
he
said
as
he
went
in
to
supper
for
he
had
already
filled
his
bath
nonsense
willie
returned
tibbie
still
out
of
temper
because
of
the
mess
at
the
door
your
papa
says
you
must
have
your
bath
and
my
poor
old
bones
must
ache
for
the
bath
filled
already
if
you
put
in
one
other
pailful
it
run
over
when
i
get
into
it
now
do
you
play
tricks
with
willie
i
wo
have
any
more
of
your
joking
returned
tibbie
nettled
at
the
way
she
took
the
information
with
which
he
had
hoped
to
please
her
he
left
her
to
carry
up
her
pail
of
water
but
it
was
the
last
and
she
thanked
him
very
kindly
the
next
day
the
only
remaining
question
was
how
to
get
rid
of
the
but
he
soon
contrived
a
sink
on
the
top
step
of
the
stair
outside
the
door
which
was
a
little
higher
than
the
wall
of
the
from
there
a
short
pipe
was
sufficient
to
carry
that
water
also
over
into
the
drain
i
may
mention
that
although
a
severe
winter
followed
the
prior
well
never
froze
and
that
as
they
were
always
either
empty
or
full
of
water
the
pipes
never
froze
and
consequently
never
burst
chapter

hector
hints
at
a
discovery
the
next
day
after
hector
visit
willie
went
to
see
how
he
was
and
found
him
better
i
certainly
am
better
he
said
and
what
more
i
got
a
strange
feeling
it
was
that
drink
of
water
you
gave
me
yesterday
that
has
done
it
i
coming
up
to
have
some
more
of
it
in
the
evening
if
you
give
it
me
as
much
of
it
as
can
drink
hector
anyhow
said
willie
you
wo
drink
cow
dry
i
wonder
if
it
could
be
the
water
said
hector
musingly
my
father
says
people
used
to
think
it
cured
them
that
was
some
hundreds
of
years
ago
but
if
it
did
so
then
i
do
see
why
it
should
now
my
mother
is
certainly
better
but
whether
that
began
since
we
found
the
well
i
ca
be
very
sure
for
tibbie
she
is
always
drinking
at
it
she
says
it
does
her
a
world
of
good
i
read
somewhere
said
the
shoemaker
that
wherever
there
a
hurt
there
a
help
and
when
i
was
a
boy
and
stung
myself
with
a
nettle
i
never
had
far
to
look
for
a
with
its
juice
who
knows
but
the
prior
well
may
be
the
cure
for
me
it
ca
straighten
my
back
i
know
but
it
may
make
me
stronger
for
all
that
and
fitter
for
the
general
business
i
will
lay
down
a
pipe
for
you
if
you
like
hector
and
then
you
can
drink
as
much
of
the
water
as
you
please
without
asking
anybody
said
willie
hector
laughed
it
not
such
a
sure
thing
he
replied
as
to
be
worth
that
trouble
and
besides
the
walk
does
me
good
and
a
drink
once
or
twice
a
day
is
enough
that
is
if
your
people
wo
think
me
a
trouble
coming
so
often
there
no
fear
of
that
said
willie
it
our
business
you
know
to
try
to
cure
people
i
tell
you
what
could
you
bring
up
a
bit
of
your
work
and
sit
in
my
room
sometimes
it
better
air
there
than
down
here
you
very
kind
indeed
willie
we
see
meantime
i
come
up
morning
and
evening
and
have
a
drink
of
the
water
as
long
at
least
as
the
warm
weather
lasts
and
by
that
time
i
shall
be
pretty
certain
whether
it
is
doing
me
good
or
not
so
hector
went
on
drinking
the
water
and
getting
a
little
better
next
grannie
took
to
it
and
either
from
imagination
or
that
it
really
did
her
good
declared
it
was
renewing
her
youth
all
the
doctor
said
on
the
matter
was
that
the
salts
it
contained
could
do
no
one
any
harm
and
might
do
some
people
much
good
that
there
was
iron
in
it
which
was
strengthening
and
certain
ingredients
besides
which
might
possibly
prevent
the
iron
from
interfering
with
other
functions
of
the
system
he
said
he
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
some
day
or
other
it
regained
its
old
fame
as
a
well
of
healing
mr
spelman
in
consequence
of
a
talk
he
had
with
hector
having
induced
his
wife
to
try
it
she
also
soon
began
to
think
it
was
doing
her
good
beyond
these
i
have
now
mentioned
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
the
prior
well
or
its
renascent
reputation
chapter
xvii
how
willie
went
on
as
soon
as
willie
began
a
new
study
he
began
trying
to
get
at
the
sense
of
it
this
caused
his
progress
to
be
slow
at
first
and
him
to
appear
dull
amongst
those
who
merely
learned
by
rote
but
as
he
got
a
hold
of
the
meaning
of
it
all
his
progress
grew
faster
and
faster
until
at
length
in
most
studies
he
outstripped
all
the
rest
i
need
hardly
repeat
that
the
constant
exercise
of
his
mind
through
his
fingers
in
giving
a
second
existence
outside
of
him
to
what
had
its
first
existence
inside
him
that
is
in
his
mind
made
it
far
easier
for
him
to
understand
the
relations
of
things
that
go
to
make
up
a
science
a
boy
who
could
put
a
box
together
must
find
euclid
easier
the
second
book
particularly
than
one
who
had
no
idea
of
the
practical
relations
of
the
boundaries
of
spaces
one
who
could
contrive
a
machine
like
his
must
be
able
to
understand
the
interdependence
of
the
parts
of
a
sentence
better
than
one
equally
gifted
otherwise
but
who
did
not
know
how
one
wheel
could
move
another
everything
he
did
would
help
his
arithmetic
and
geography
and
history
and
these
and
those
and
all
things
besides
would
help
him
to
understand
poetry
in
his
latin
sentences
he
found
the
parts
fit
into
each
other
like
finding
the
terms
of
equations
he
said
was
like
inventing
machines
and
he
soon
grew
clever
at
solving
them
it
was
not
from
his
manual
abilities
alone
that
his
father
had
given
him
the
name
of
willie
but
from
the
fact
that
his
mind
once
warmed
to
interest
could
accommodate
itself
to
the
peculiarities
of
any
science
just
as
the
which
is
used
for
taking
a
mould
fits
itself
to
the
outs
and
ins
of
any
figure
he
still
employed
his
to
pull
him
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
had
of
course
to
make
considerable
alterations
in
or
rather
additions
to
its
machinery
after
changing
his
for
it
had
then
to
work
in
a
direction
at
right
angles
to
the
former
but
this
he
managed
perfectly
it
is
well
for
willie
reputation
with
a
certain
and
that
not
a
small
class
of
readers
that
there
was
something
even
they
would
call
useful
in
several
of
his
inventions
and
many
of
his
efforts
in
his
hydraulics
for
instance
by
means
of
which
he
saved
old
tibby
limbs
in
his
too
by
means
of
which
they
were
able
to
take
in
grannie
and
for
a
long
time
now
he
had
been
doing
every
little
repair
wanted
in
the
house
if
a
lock
went
wrong
he
would
have
it
off
at
once
and
taken
to
pieces
if
less
would
not
do
he
carried
it
to
the
smithy
but
very
seldom
troubled
mr
willett
about
it
for
he
had
learned
to
do
small
jobs
and
to
heat
and
work
and
temper
a
piece
of
iron
within
his
strength
as
well
as
any
man
his
mother
did
not
much
like
this
part
of
his
general
apprenticeship
for
he
would
get
his
hands
so
black
sometimes
on
a
saturday
afternoon
that
he
could
not
get
them
clean
enough
for
church
the
next
day
and
sometimes
he
would
come
home
with
little
holes
burnt
here
and
there
in
his
clothes
by
the
sparks
from
the
iron
when
beaten
on
the
anvil
concerning
this
last
evil
she
spoke
at
length
to
hector
who
made
him
a
leather
apron
like
mr
willett
which
thereafter
he
always
wore
when
he
had
a
job
to
do
in
the
smithy
it
is
well
i
say
that
the
utility
of
such
of
his
doings
as
these
will
be
admitted
by
all
for
some
other
objects
upon
which
he
spent
much
labour
would
by
most
people
be
regarded
as
utterly
useless
few
for
instance
would
allow
there
was
any
value
in
a
which
could
grind
no
corn
and
was
of
service
only
to
wake
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
not
for
work
not
for
the
learning
of
a
single
lesson
but
only
that
he
might
stare
out
of
the
window
for
a
while
and
then
get
into
bed
again
for
my
part
nevertheless
i
think
it
a
most
useful
contrivance
for
all
lovely
sights
tend
to
keep
the
soul
pure
to
lift
the
heart
up
to
god
and
above
not
merely
what
people
call
low
cares
but
what
people
would
call
reasonable
cares
although
our
great
teacher
teaches
us
that
such
cares
are
unjust
towards
our
father
in
heaven
more
than
that
by
helping
to
keep
the
mind
calm
and
pure
they
help
to
keep
the
imagination
which
is
the
source
of
all
invention
active
and
the
judgment
which
weighs
all
its
suggestions
just
whatever
is
beautiful
is
of
god
and
it
is
only
ignorance
or
a
low
condition
of
heart
and
soul
that
does
not
prize
what
is
beautiful
if
i
had
a
choice
between
two
mills
one
that
would
set
fine
dinners
on
my
table
and
one
that
would
show
me
lovely
sights
in
earth
and
sky
and
sea
i
know
which
i
should
count
the
more
useful
perhaps
there
is
not
so
much
to
be
said
for
the
next
whim
of
willie
but
a
part
at
least
of
what
i
have
just
written
will
apply
to
it
also
what
put
it
in
his
head
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
it
was
two
things
together
seeing
a
soaring
lark
radiant
with
the
light
of
the
unrisen
sun
and
finding
in
a
corner
of
spelman
shop
a
large
gilt
ball
which
had
belonged
to
an
old
clock
he
had
bought
the
passage
in
which
he
set
it
up
was
so
low
that
he
had
to
remove
the
ornaments
from
the
top
of
it
but
this
one
was
humbled
that
it
might
be
exalted
the
very
sight
of
it
set
willie
thinking
what
he
could
do
with
it
for
he
not
only
meditated
how
to
do
a
thing
but
sometimes
what
to
make
a
thing
do
nor
was
it
long
ere
he
made
up
his
mind
and
set
about
a
huge
kite
more
than
six
feet
high
a
great
strong
monster
with
a
tail
of
portentous
length
to
the
top
of
the
arch
of
which
he
attached
the
golden
ball
then
he
bought
a
quantity
of
string
and
set
his
wheel
to
call
him
up
an
hour
before
sunrise
one
morning
was
too
still
another
too
cloudy
and
a
third
wet
but
at
last
came
one
clear
and
cool
with
a
steady
breeze
which
sent
the
leaves
of
the
black
poplars
all
one
way
he
dressed
with
speed
and
taking
his
kite
and
string
set
out
for
a
grass
field
belonging
to
farmer
thomson
where
he
found
most
of
the
daisies
still
buttoned
up
in
sleep
their
red
tips
all
together
as
tight
and
close
as
the
lips
of
a
baby
that
take
what
is
offered
it
as
if
they
never
meant
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
sun
and
would
never
again
show
him
the
little
golden
sun
they
had
themselves
inside
of
them
in
a
few
minutes
the
kite
had
begun
to
soar
slowly
and
steadily
then
faster
and
faster
until
at
length
it
was
towering
aloft
tugging
and
pulling
at
the
string
which
he
could
not
let
out
fast
enough
he
kept
looking
up
after
it
intently
as
it
rose
when
suddenly
a
new
morning
star
burst
out
in
golden
glitter
it
was
the
gilt
ball
it
saw
the
sun
the
glory
which
striking
on
the
heart
of
the
lark
was
there
transmuted
into
song
came
back
from
the
ball
after
its
kind
in
glow
and
gleam
he
danced
with
delight
and
shouted
and
sang
his
welcome
to
the
resurrection
of
the
sun
as
he
watched
his
golden
ball
alone
in
the
depth
of
the
air
he
never
thought
of
any
one
hearing
him
nor
was
it
likely
that
any
one
in
the
village
would
be
up
yet
he
was
therefore
a
good
deal
surprised
when
he
heard
the
sweet
voice
of
mona
shepherd
behind
him
and
turning
saw
her
running
to
him
with
her
hair
flying
in
the
wind
willie
willie
she
was
crying
with
haste
and
the
buffeting
of
the
breeze
well
mona
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
out
so
early
may
a
girl
get
up
early
as
well
as
a
boy
it
not
like
climbing
walls
and
trees
you
know
though
i
ca
see
the
harm
of
that
either
no
more
can
i
said
willie
if
they
not
too
difficult
you
know
but
what
brought
you
out
now
do
you
want
me
may
i
stop
with
you
i
saw
you
looking
up
and
i
looked
up
too
and
then
i
saw
something
flash
and
i
dressed
as
hard
as
i
could
and
ran
out
are
you
catching
the
lightning
no
said
willie
something
better
than
the
lightning
the
sunlight
is
that
all
said
mona
disappointed
why
mona
is
the
sunlight
a
better
thing
than
the
lightning
said
philosophical
willie
yes
i
dare
say
but
you
can
have
it
any
time
that
only
makes
it
the
more
valuable
but
it
not
quite
true
when
you
think
of
it
you
ca
have
it
now
except
from
my
ball
oh
yes
i
can
cried
mona
for
there
he
comes
himself
and
there
to
be
sure
was
the
first
blinding
arc
of
the
sun
rising
over
the
eastern
hill
both
of
them
forgot
the
kite
and
turned
to
watch
the
great
marvel
of
the
heavens
throbbing
and
pulsing
like
a
sea
of
flame
when
they
turned
again
to
the
kite
they
could
see
the
golden
ball
no
longer
its
work
was
over
it
had
told
them
the
sun
was
coming
and
now
when
the
sun
was
come
it
was
not
wanted
any
more
willie
began
to
draw
in
his
string
and
roll
it
up
on
its
stick
slowly
pulling
down
to
the
earth
the
soaring
he
had
sent
aloft
for
the
news
he
had
never
flown
anything
like
such
a
large
kite
before
and
he
found
it
difficult
to
reclaim
will
you
take
me
out
with
you
next
time
willie
asked
mona
pleadingly
i
do
so
like
to
be
out
in
the
morning
when
the
wind
is
blowing
and
the
clouds
are
flying
about
i
wonder
why
everybody
get
up
to
see
the
sun
rise
do
you
think
it
is
well
worth
seeing
that
i
do
then
you
will
let
me
come
with
you
i
like
it
so
much
better
when
you
are
with
me
janet
spoils
it
all
janet
was
her
old
nurse
who
seemed
to
think
the
main
part
of
her
duty
was
to
check
mona
enthusiasm
i
will
said
willie
if
your
papa
has
no
objection
mona
did
not
even
remember
her
mamma
she
had
died
when
she
was
such
a
little
thing
come
and
ask
him
then
said
mona
so
soon
as
he
had
secured
as
he
called
his
kite
with
the
golden
head
she
took
his
hand
to
lead
him
to
her
father
he
wo
be
up
yet
said
willie
oh
yes
long
ago
cried
mona
he
always
up
first
in
the
house
and
as
soon
as
he
dressed
he
calls
me
he
be
at
breakfast
by
this
time
and
wondering
what
can
have
become
of
me
so
willie
went
with
her
and
there
was
mr
shepherd
as
she
had
said
already
seated
at
breakfast
what
have
you
been
about
mona
my
child
he
asked
as
soon
as
he
had
shaken
hands
with
willie
we
been
helping
the
sun
to
rise
said
mona
merrily
no
no
said
willie
we
only
been
having
a
peep
at
him
in
bed
before
he
got
up
oh
yes
chimed
in
mona
and
he
was
so
fast
asleep
and
snoring
she
added
with
a
comical
expression
and
tone
as
if
it
were
a
thing
not
to
be
mentioned
save
as
a
secret
but
willie
did
not
like
the
word
and
her
father
was
of
the
same
mind
no
no
said
mr
shepherd
that
not
respectful
mona
i
do
like
you
to
talk
that
way
even
in
fun
of
the
great
light
of
the
earth
there
are
more
good
reasons
for
objecting
to
it
than
you
would
quite
understand
yet
willie
would
not
talk
like
that
i
am
sure
tell
me
what
you
have
been
about
my
boy
willie
explained
the
whole
matter
and
asked
if
he
might
call
mona
the
next
time
he
went
out
with
his
kite
in
the
morning
mr
shepherd
consented
at
once
and
mona
said
he
had
only
to
call
from
his
window
into
their
garden
and
she
would
be
sure
to
hear
him
even
if
she
was
asleep
the
next
thing
willie
did
was
to
construct
a
small
windlass
in
the
garden
with
which
to
wind
up
or
let
out
the
string
of
the
kite
and
when
the
next
fit
morning
arrived
mona
and
he
went
out
together
the
wind
blowing
right
through
the
garden
they
did
not
go
to
the
open
field
but
sent
up
the
kite
from
the
windlass
and
mona
was
able
by
means
of
the
winch
to
let
out
the
string
while
willie
kept
watching
for
the
moment
when
the
golden
ball
should
catch
the
light
they
did
the
same
for
several
mornings
after
and
willie
managed
with
the
help
to
calculate
exactly
the
height
to
which
the
ball
had
flown
when
first
it
gained
a
peep
of
the
sun
in
bed
one
windy
evening
they
sent
the
kite
up
in
the
hope
that
it
would
fly
till
the
morning
but
the
wind
fell
in
the
night
and
when
the
sun
came
near
there
was
no
golden
ball
in
the
air
to
greet
him
so
instead
of
rejoicing
in
its
glitter
far
aloft
they
had
to
set
out
guided
by
the
string
to
find
the
fallen
lucifer
the
kite
was
of
small
consequence
but
the
golden
ball
willie
could
not
replace
alas
that
very
evening
he
had
added
a
great
length
of
string
so
much
that
when
the
wind
ceased
the
kite
could
just
reach
the
river
into
which
it
fell
and
when
the
searchers
at
length
drew
from
the
water
they
found
his
glory
had
departed
the
golden
ball
had
been
beaten
and
ground
upon
the
stones
of
the
stream
and
never
more
did
they
send
him
climbing
up
the
heavens
to
welcome
the
lord
of
day
indeed
it
was
many
years
before
willie
flew
a
kite
again
for
after
a
certain
conversation
with
his
grandmother
he
began
to
give
a
good
deal
more
time
to
his
lessons
than
hitherto
and
while
his
recreations
continued
to
be
all
of
a
practical
sort
his
reading
was
mostly
such
as
prepared
him
for
college
chapter
xviii
willie
talk
with
his
grandmother
one
evening
in
winter
when
he
had
been
putting
coals
on
his
fire
she
told
him
to
take
a
chair
beside
her
as
she
wanted
a
little
talk
with
him
he
obeyed
her
gladly
well
willie
she
said
what
would
you
like
to
be
willie
had
just
been
helping
to
shoe
a
horse
at
the
smithy
and
in
fact
had
driven
one
of
the
nails
an
operation
perilous
to
the
horse
full
of
the
thing
which
had
last
occupied
him
he
answered
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
should
like
to
be
a
blacksmith
grannie
the
old
lady
smiled
she
had
seen
more
black
on
willie
hands
than
could
have
come
from
the
coals
and
judged
from
that
and
his
answer
that
he
had
just
come
from
the
smithy
an
unwise
grandmother
had
she
wished
to
turn
him
from
the
notion
would
have
started
an
objection
at
once
probably
calling
it
a
dirty
trade
or
a
dangerous
trade
or
a
trade
that
the
son
of
a
professional
man
could
not
be
allowed
to
follow
but
willie
grandmother
knew
better
and
went
on
talking
about
the
thing
in
the
quietest
manner
it
a
fine
trade
she
said
thorough
manly
work
and
healthy
i
believe
notwithstanding
the
heat
but
why
would
you
take
to
it
willie
willie
fell
back
on
his
principles
and
thought
for
a
minute
of
course
if
i
to
be
any
good
at
all
i
must
have
a
hand
in
what
hector
calls
the
general
business
of
the
universe
grannie
to
be
sure
and
that
as
a
smith
you
would
have
but
why
should
you
choose
to
be
a
smith
rather
than
anything
else
in
the
world
because
because
people
ca
get
on
without
and
ploughs
and
harrows
and
tires
for
and
locks
and
all
that
it
would
help
people
very
much
if
i
were
a
smith
i
do
doubt
it
but
if
you
were
a
mason
you
could
do
quite
as
much
to
make
them
comfortable
you
could
build
them
houses
yes
i
could
it
would
be
delightful
to
build
houses
for
people
i
should
like
that
it
very
hard
work
said
his
grandmother
only
you
would
mind
that
i
know
willie
no
man
minds
hard
work
said
willie
i
think
i
should
like
to
be
a
mason
for
then
you
see
i
should
be
able
to
look
at
what
i
had
done
the
ploughs
and
carts
would
go
away
out
of
sight
but
the
good
houses
would
stand
where
i
had
built
them
and
i
should
be
able
to
see
how
comfortable
the
people
were
in
them
i
should
come
nearer
to
the
people
themselves
that
way
with
my
work
yes
grannie
i
would
rather
be
a
mason
than
a
smith
a
carpenter
fits
up
the
houses
inside
said
his
grandmother
you
think
with
his
work
he
comes
nearer
the
people
that
live
in
it
than
the
mason
does
to
be
sure
cried
willie
laughing
people
hardly
see
the
work
except
as
they
coming
up
to
the
door
i
know
more
about
carpenter
work
too
grannie
i
have
settled
now
i
be
a
carpenter
there
cried
willie
jumping
up
from
his
seat
if
it
been
for
mr
spelman
i
do
see
how
we
could
have
had
with
us
grannie
think
of
that
only
if
you
had
been
a
tailor
or
a
shoemaker
you
would
have
come
still
nearer
to
the
people
themselves
i
do
know
much
about
tailoring
returned
willie
i
could
stitch
well
enough
but
i
could
cut
out
i
could
soon
be
a
shoemaker
though
i
done
everything
wanted
in
a
shoe
or
a
boot
with
my
own
hands
already
hector
will
tell
you
so
i
could
begin
to
be
a
shoemaker
that
is
nearer
than
a
carpenter
yes
i
was
going
to
suggest
said
his
grannie
that
there
a
kind
of
work
that
goes
yet
nearer
to
the
people
it
helps
than
any
of
those
but
of
course
if
you
made
up
your
mind
oh
no
grannie
i
do
mean
it
so
much
as
that
if
there
a
better
way
you
know
tell
me
what
it
is
i
want
you
to
think
and
find
out
willie
thought
looked
puzzled
and
said
he
could
tell
what
it
was
then
you
must
think
a
little
longer
said
his
grandmother
and
now
go
and
wash
your
hands
chapter
xvix
a
talk
with
mr
shepherd
in
a
few
minutes
willie
came
rushing
back
from
his
room
with
his
hands
and
face
half
wet
and
half
dry
grannie
grannie
he
panted
what
a
stupid
i
am
how
can
a
body
be
so
stupid
of
course
you
mean
a
doctor
work
my
father
comes
nearer
to
people
to
help
them
than
anybody
else
can
and
yet
i
never
thought
what
you
meant
how
is
it
you
can
know
a
thing
and
not
know
it
at
the
same
moment
well
now
you
found
what
i
meant
what
do
you
think
of
it
said
his
grandmother
why
of
course
it
the
best
of
all
when
i
was
a
little
fellow
i
used
to
think
i
should
be
a
doctor
some
day
but
i
do
feel
quite
so
sure
of
it
now
do
you
really
think
grannie
i
be
a
doctor
like
papa
you
see
that
wants
such
a
good
head
and
and
everything
yes
it
does
want
a
good
head
and
everything
but
you
got
a
good
enough
head
to
begin
with
and
it
depends
on
yourself
to
make
it
a
better
one
so
long
as
people
hearts
keep
growing
better
their
heads
do
the
same
i
think
you
have
every
faculty
for
the
making
of
a
good
doctor
in
you
do
you
really
think
so
grannie
cried
willie
delighted
i
do
indeed
then
i
shall
ask
papa
to
teach
me
but
willie
did
not
find
his
papa
quite
ready
to
take
him
in
hand
no
willie
he
said
you
must
learn
a
great
many
other
things
before
it
would
be
of
much
use
for
me
to
commence
my
part
i
will
teach
you
if
you
like
after
to
compound
certain
medicines
but
the
important
thing
is
to
get
on
at
school
you
are
quite
old
enough
now
to
work
at
home
too
and
though
i
do
want
to
confine
you
to
your
lessons
i
should
like
you
to
spend
a
couple
of
hours
at
them
every
evening
you
can
have
the
remainders
of
the
evenings
all
the
mornings
before
breakfast
and
the
greater
parts
of
your
for
whatever
you
like
to
do
of
another
sort
willie
never
required
any
urging
to
what
his
father
wished
he
became
at
once
more
of
a
student
without
becoming
much
less
of
a
workman
for
he
found
plenty
of
time
to
do
all
he
wanted
by
being
more
careful
of
his
odd
moments
one
lovely
evening
in
spring
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
left
the
air
soft
and
balmy
and
full
of
the
scents
which
rise
from
the
earth
after
a
shower
and
the
odours
of
the
buds
which
were
swelling
and
bursting
in
all
directions
willie
was
standing
looking
out
of
his
open
window
into
the
parson
garden
when
mr
shepherd
saw
him
and
called
to
him
come
down
here
willie
he
said
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
willie
got
on
the
wall
from
the
top
of
his
stair
dropped
into
the
which
served
for
the
parson
pony
as
well
as
the
two
horses
and
thence
passed
into
mr
shepherd
garden
where
the
two
began
to
walk
up
and
down
together
the
year
was
like
a
child
waking
up
from
a
sleep
into
which
he
had
fallen
crying
its
life
was
returning
to
it
fresh
and
new
it
was
as
if
god
were
again
drawing
nigh
to
his
world
all
the
winter
through
he
had
never
left
it
only
had
as
it
were
been
rolling
it
along
the
path
before
him
but
now
had
taken
it
up
in
his
hand
and
was
carrying
it
for
a
while
and
that
was
how
its
birds
were
singing
so
sweetly
and
its
buds
were
coming
so
blithely
out
of
doors
and
the
wind
blew
so
soft
and
the
rain
fell
so
repentantly
and
the
earth
sent
up
such
a
gracious
odour
the
year
is
coming
to
itself
again
willie
growing
busy
once
more
mr
shepherd
said
yes
answered
willie
it
been
all
but
dead
and
has
come
to
life
again
it
must
have
had
the
doctor
to
it
eh
what
doctor
willie
well
you
know
there
is
but
one
that
could
be
doctor
to
this
big
world
yes
surely
returned
mr
shepherd
and
that
brings
me
to
what
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
i
hear
your
father
means
to
make
a
doctor
of
you
yes
is
it
good
of
him
said
willie
then
you
would
like
it
yes
that
i
should
why
would
you
like
it
because
i
have
a
hand
in
the
general
business
what
do
you
mean
by
that
willie
set
forth
hector
macallaster
way
of
thinking
about
such
matters
very
good
very
good
indeed
remarked
mr
shepherd
but
why
then
should
you
prefer
being
a
doctor
to
being
a
shoemaker
is
it
because
you
will
get
better
paid
for
it
i
never
thought
of
that
returned
willie
of
course
i
should
be
better
paid
for
hector
could
keep
a
horse
and
a
horse
i
must
have
else
some
of
my
patients
would
be
dead
before
i
could
get
to
them
but
that
not
why
i
want
to
be
a
doctor
it
because
i
want
to
help
people
what
makes
you
want
to
help
people
because
it
the
best
thing
you
can
do
with
yourself
who
told
you
that
i
do
know
it
seems
as
if
everybody
and
everything
had
been
teaching
me
that
ever
since
i
can
remember
well
it
no
wonder
it
should
seem
as
if
everything
taught
you
that
seeing
that
is
what
god
is
always
doing
and
what
jesus
taught
us
as
the
law
of
his
kingdom
which
is
the
only
real
kingdom
namely
that
the
greatest
man
in
it
is
he
who
gives
himself
the
most
to
help
other
people
it
was
because
jesus
himself
did
so
giving
himself
up
utterly
that
god
has
so
highly
exalted
him
and
given
him
a
name
above
every
name
and
indeed
if
you
are
a
good
doctor
you
will
be
doing
something
of
what
jesus
did
when
he
was
in
the
world
yes
but
he
did
give
people
medicine
to
cure
them
no
that
was
necessary
because
he
was
himself
the
cure
but
now
that
he
is
not
present
with
his
bodily
presence
now
medicine
and
advice
and
other
good
things
are
just
the
packets
in
which
he
wraps
up
the
healing
he
sends
and
the
wisest
doctor
is
but
the
messenger
who
carries
to
the
sick
as
much
of
healing
and
help
as
the
great
doctor
sees
fit
to
send
for
he
is
so
anxious
to
cure
thoroughly
that
in
many
cases
he
will
not
cure
all
at
once
how
i
like
to
take
his
healing
about
cried
willie
just
as
the
doctors
boys
take
the
medicines
about
in
baskets
grannie
tells
me
they
do
in
the
big
towns
i
like
to
be
the
great
doctor
boy
you
really
think
then
mr
shepherd
resumed
after
a
pause
that
a
doctor
is
the
best
way
of
helping
people
yes
i
do
answered
willie
decidedly
a
doctor
you
see
comes
nearest
to
them
with
his
help
it
not
the
outside
of
a
man
body
he
helps
but
his
inside
health
how
he
feels
you
know
mr
shepherd
again
thought
for
a
few
moments
at
length
he
said
what
the
difference
between
your
father
work
and
mine
a
great
difference
of
course
replied
willie
tell
me
then
what
it
is
i
must
think
before
i
can
do
that
said
willie
it
not
so
easy
to
put
things
in
words
you
very
often
go
to
help
the
same
people
something
to
start
with
but
not
to
give
them
the
same
help
no
not
quite
and
yet
at
least
i
can
not
write
prescriptions
or
compound
medicines
for
them
seeing
i
know
nothing
about
such
things
said
mr
shepherd
but
on
the
other
hand
though
i
ca
give
them
medicine
out
of
your
basket
your
papa
very
often
gives
them
medicine
out
of
mine
that
a
riddle
i
suppose
said
willie
no
it
not
how
is
it
your
papa
can
come
so
near
people
to
help
them
he
gives
them
things
that
make
them
well
again
what
do
they
do
with
the
things
he
gives
them
they
take
them
how
put
them
in
their
mouths
and
swallow
them
could
they
take
them
at
their
ears
no
answered
willie
laughing
why
not
because
their
ears
are
meant
for
taking
them
are
their
ears
meant
for
taking
anything
then
only
words
well
if
one
were
to
try
might
words
be
mixed
so
as
to
be
medicine
i
do
see
how
if
you
were
to
take
a
few
strong
words
a
few
persuasive
words
and
a
few
tender
words
might
you
mix
them
so
that
is
so
set
them
in
order
as
to
make
them
a
good
medicine
for
a
sore
heart
for
instance
ah
i
see
i
see
yes
the
medicine
for
the
heart
must
go
in
at
the
ears
not
necessarily
it
might
go
in
at
the
eyes
jesus
gave
it
at
the
eyes
for
doubting
hearts
when
he
said
consider
the
lilies
consider
the
ravens
at
the
ears
too
though
said
willie
just
as
papa
sometimes
gives
a
medicine
to
be
taken
and
to
be
rubbed
in
both
only
the
ears
could
have
done
nothing
with
the
words
if
the
eyes
taken
in
the
things
themselves
first
but
where
does
this
medicine
go
to
willie
i
suppose
it
must
go
to
the
heart
if
that
the
place
wants
healing
does
it
go
to
what
a
doctor
would
call
the
heart
then
no
no
it
must
go
to
what
to
what
a
clergyman
to
what
call
the
heart
and
which
heart
is
nearer
to
the
person
himself
willie
thought
for
a
moment
then
answered
merrily
the
heart
to
be
sure
no
willie
you
wrong
there
said
mr
shepherd
looking
as
he
felt
a
little
disappointed
oh
yes
please
said
willie
i
almost
sure
i
right
this
time
no
willie
what
the
clergyman
calls
the
heart
is
the
nearest
to
the
man
himself
no
no
persisted
willie
the
heart
you
got
to
do
with
the
man
himself
so
of
course
the
doctor
heart
is
the
nearer
to
the
man
mr
shepherd
laughed
a
low
pleasant
laugh
you
quite
right
willie
you
got
the
best
of
it
i
very
pleased
but
then
willie
does
it
strike
you
that
after
all
there
might
be
a
closer
way
of
helping
men
than
the
doctor
way
again
willie
thought
a
while
there
would
be
he
said
at
length
if
you
could
give
them
medicine
to
make
them
happy
when
they
are
miserable
even
the
doctor
can
do
a
little
at
that
returned
mr
shepherd
for
when
in
good
health
people
are
much
happier
than
when
they
are
if
you
could
give
them
what
would
make
them
good
when
they
are
bad
then
said
willie
ah
there
you
have
it
rejoined
mr
shepherd
that
is
the
very
closest
way
of
helping
men
but
nobody
can
do
that
nobody
can
make
a
bad
man
good
but
god
said
willie
certainly
but
he
uses
medicines
and
he
sends
people
about
with
them
just
like
the
doctors
boys
you
were
speaking
of
what
else
am
here
for
i
been
carrying
his
medicines
about
for
a
good
many
years
now
then
work
and
not
my
father
comes
nearest
to
people
to
help
them
after
all
my
father
work
i
see
does
help
the
very
man
himself
it
only
helps
his
body
or
at
best
his
happiness
it
does
go
deep
enough
to
touch
himself
but
yours
helps
the
very
man
yours
is
the
best
after
all
i
do
know
returned
mr
shepherd
thoughtfully
it
depends
i
think
on
the
kind
of
preparation
gone
through
oh
yes
said
willie
you
had
to
go
through
the
theological
classes
i
must
of
course
take
the
medical
that
true
but
it
not
true
enough
said
mr
shepherd
that
would
make
a
fraction
of
the
difference
i
mean
there
just
one
preparation
essential
for
a
man
who
would
carry
about
the
best
sort
of
medicines
can
you
think
what
it
is
it
not
necessary
for
the
other
sort
the
man
must
be
good
said
willie
i
suppose
that
it
that
does
make
the
difference
exactly
returned
mr
shepherd
it
is
as
necessary
for
a
doctor
to
be
good
as
for
a
parson
yes
said
willie
but
though
the
doctor
were
a
bad
man
his
medicines
might
be
good
not
by
any
means
so
likely
to
be
said
the
parson
you
can
never
be
sure
that
anything
a
bad
man
has
to
do
with
will
be
good
it
may
be
because
no
man
is
all
bad
but
you
ca
be
sure
of
it
we
are
coming
nearer
it
now
might
the
parson
medicines
be
good
if
he
were
bad
just
as
well
as
the
doctor
less
likely
still
i
think
said
willie
the
words
might
be
all
of
the
right
sort
but
they
would
be
like
medicines
that
had
lain
in
his
drawers
or
stood
in
his
bottles
till
the
good
was
all
out
of
them
you
coming
very
near
to
the
difference
of
preparation
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
you
said
mr
shepherd
it
is
this
that
the
physician
of
men
commonly
called
must
have
taken
and
must
keep
taking
the
medicine
he
carries
about
with
him
while
the
less
the
doctor
wants
of
his
the
better
i
see
i
see
cried
willie
whom
a
fitting
phrase
or
figure
or
form
of
expressing
a
thing
pleased
as
much
as
a
clever
machine
i
see
all
right
i
understand
now
but
mr
shepherd
went
on
your
father
carries
about
both
sorts
of
medicines
in
his
basket
he
is
such
a
healthy
man
that
i
believe
he
very
seldom
uses
any
of
his
own
medicines
but
he
is
always
taking
some
of
the
other
sort
and
that
what
makes
him
fit
to
carry
them
about
he
does
far
more
good
among
the
sick
than
i
can
many
who
do
like
my
medicine
will
yet
take
a
little
of
it
when
your
father
mixes
it
with
his
as
he
has
a
wonderful
art
in
doing
i
hope
when
your
turn
comes
you
will
be
able
to
help
the
very
man
himself
as
your
father
does
do
you
want
me
to
be
a
doctor
of
kind
mr
shepherd
no
it
is
a
very
wrong
thing
to
take
up
that
basket
without
being
told
by
him
who
makes
the
medicine
if
he
wants
a
man
to
do
so
he
will
let
him
know
he
will
call
him
and
tell
him
to
do
it
but
everybody
ought
to
take
the
medicine
for
everybody
needs
it
and
the
happy
thing
is
that
as
soon
as
anyone
has
found
how
good
it
is
food
and
wine
and
all
upholding
things
in
one
he
becomes
both
able
and
anxious
to
give
it
to
others
if
you
would
help
people
as
much
as
your
father
does
you
must
begin
by
taking
some
of
the
real
medicine
yourself
this
conversation
gave
willie
a
good
deal
to
think
about
and
he
had
much
need
to
think
about
it
for
soon
after
this
he
left
his
house
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
went
to
a
great
town
to
receive
there
a
little
further
preparation
for
college
the
next
year
he
gained
a
scholarship
or
as
they
call
it
there
a
and
was
at
once
fully
occupied
with
classics
and
mathematics
hoping
however
the
next
year
to
combine
with
them
certain
scientific
studies
bearing
less
indirectly
upon
the
duties
of
the
medical
man
chapter
xx
how
willie
did
his
best
to
make
a
bird
of
agnes
during
the
time
he
was
at
college
he
did
often
think
of
what
mr
shepherd
had
said
to
him
when
he
was
tempted
to
any
the
thought
would
always
rise
that
this
was
not
the
way
to
become
able
to
help
people
especially
the
real
selves
of
them
and
when
amongst
the
medical
students
he
could
not
help
thinking
how
much
better
doctors
some
of
them
would
make
if
they
would
but
try
the
medicine
of
the
other
basket
for
themselves
he
thought
this
especially
when
he
saw
that
they
cared
nothing
for
their
patients
neither
had
any
desire
to
take
a
part
in
the
general
business
for
the
work
sake
but
only
wanted
a
practice
that
they
might
make
a
living
for
such
are
nearly
as
unfit
to
be
healers
of
the
body
as
mere
professional
clergymen
to
be
healers
of
broken
hearts
and
wounded
minds
to
do
a
man
good
in
any
way
you
must
sympathise
with
him
that
is
know
what
he
feels
and
reflect
the
feeling
in
your
own
mirror
and
to
be
a
good
doctor
one
must
love
to
heal
must
honour
the
art
of
the
physician
and
rejoice
in
it
must
give
himself
to
it
that
he
may
learn
all
of
it
that
he
can
from
its
root
of
love
to
its
branches
of
theory
and
its
leaves
and
fruits
of
healing
he
always
came
home
to
priory
leas
for
the
summer
intervals
when
you
may
be
sure
there
was
great
rejoicing
loudest
on
the
part
of
agnes
who
was
then
his
constant
companion
as
much
so
at
least
as
she
was
allowed
willie
saw
a
good
deal
of
mona
shepherd
also
who
had
long
been
set
free
from
the
oppressive
charge
of
janet
and
was
now
under
the
care
of
a
governess
a
wise
elderly
lady
and
as
she
was
a
great
friend
of
mrs
macmichael
the
two
families
were
even
more
together
now
than
they
had
been
in
former
years
of
course
while
at
college
he
had
no
time
to
work
with
his
hands
all
his
labour
there
must
be
with
his
head
but
when
he
came
home
he
had
plenty
of
time
for
both
sorts
he
spent
a
couple
of
hours
before
breakfast
in
the
study
of
physiology
after
breakfast
another
hour
or
two
either
in
the
surgery
or
in
a
part
of
the
ruins
which
he
had
roughly
fitted
up
for
a
laboratory
with
a
bench
a
few
shelves
and
a
furnace
his
father
however
did
not
favour
his
being
in
the
latter
for
a
long
time
together
for
young
experimenters
are
commonly
careless
and
will
often
neglect
proper
precautions
breathing
for
instance
many
gases
they
ought
not
to
breathe
he
was
so
careful
over
agnes
however
that
often
he
would
not
let
her
in
at
all
and
when
he
did
he
generally
confined
himself
to
her
amusement
he
would
show
her
such
lovely
things
for
instance
liquids
that
changed
from
one
gorgeous
hue
to
another
bubbles
that
burst
into
flame
and
ascended
in
rings
of
white
revolving
smoke
light
so
intense
that
it
seemed
to
darken
the
daylight
sometimes
mona
would
be
of
the
party
and
nothing
pleased
agnes
or
her
better
than
such
wonderful
things
as
these
while
willie
found
it
very
amusing
to
hear
agnes
who
was
sharp
enough
to
pick
up
not
a
few
of
the
chemical
names
dropping
the
big
words
from
her
lips
as
if
she
were
on
the
most
familiar
terms
with
the
things
they
signified
hydrogen
metaphosphoric
acid
sesquiferrocyanide
of
and
such
like
then
he
would
give
an
hour
to
preparation
for
the
studies
of
next
term
after
which
until
their
early
dinner
he
would
work
at
his
bench
or
generally
at
something
for
his
mother
or
grandmother
or
he
would
do
a
little
amongst
the
ruins
patching
and
strengthening
or
even
buttressing
where
he
thought
there
was
most
danger
of
further
fall
for
he
had
resolved
that
if
he
could
help
it
not
another
stone
should
come
to
the
ground
in
this
his
first
summer
at
home
from
college
he
also
fitted
up
a
small
forge
in
a
part
of
the
ruins
where
there
was
a
wide
chimney
whose
vent
ran
up
a
long
way
unbroken
here
he
constructed
a
pair
of
great
bellows
and
set
up
an
old
anvil
which
he
bought
for
a
trifle
from
mr
willett
and
here
his
father
actually
trusted
him
to
shoe
his
horses
nor
did
he
ever
find
a
nail
of
willie
driving
require
to
be
drawn
before
the
shoe
had
to
give
place
to
a
new
one
in
the
afternoon
he
always
read
history
or
tales
or
poetry
and
in
the
evening
did
whatever
he
felt
inclined
to
do
which
brings
me
to
what
occupied
him
the
last
hours
of
the
daylight
for
a
good
part
of
this
first
summer
one
lovely
evening
in
june
he
came
upon
agnes
who
was
now
eight
years
old
lying
under
the
largest
elm
of
a
clump
of
great
elms
and
scotch
firs
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
they
were
the
highest
trees
in
all
the
neighbourhood
and
his
father
was
very
fond
of
them
to
look
up
into
those
elms
in
the
summer
time
your
eyes
seemed
to
lose
their
way
in
a
mist
of
leaves
whereas
the
firs
had
only
great
bony
bare
gaunt
arms
with
a
tuft
of
bristles
here
and
there
but
when
a
ray
of
the
setting
sun
alighted
upon
one
of
these
firs
it
shone
like
a
flamingo
it
seemed
as
if
the
surly
old
tree
and
the
gracious
sunset
had
some
secret
between
them
which
as
often
as
they
met
broke
out
in
ruddy
flame
now
agnes
was
lying
on
the
thin
grass
under
this
clump
of
trees
looking
up
into
their
mystery
and
what
else
do
you
think
she
was
doing
she
was
sucking
her
thumb
her
custom
always
when
she
was
thoughtful
and
thoughtful
she
seemed
now
for
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
what
is
the
matter
with
my
pet
said
willie
but
instead
of
jumping
up
and
flinging
her
arms
about
him
she
only
looked
at
him
gave
a
little
sigh
drew
her
thumb
from
her
mouth
pointed
with
it
up
into
the
tree
and
said
i
ca
get
up
there
i
wish
i
was
a
bird
and
put
her
thumb
in
her
mouth
again
but
if
you
were
a
bird
you
would
be
a
girl
you
know
and
you
would
like
that
said
willie
at
least
should
like
it
should
mind
i
would
rather
have
wings
and
fly
about
in
the
trees
if
you
had
wings
you
could
have
arms
i
rather
have
wings
if
you
were
a
bird
up
there
you
would
be
sure
to
wish
you
were
a
girl
down
here
for
if
you
were
a
bird
you
could
lie
in
the
grass
and
look
up
into
the
tree
oh
yes
i
could
what
a
comical
little
bird
you
would
look
then
lying
on
your
little
round
feathery
back
with
wings
spread
out
to
keep
you
from
rolling
over
and
little
sparkling
eyes
one
on
each
side
of
such
a
long
beak
staring
up
into
the
tree
miaw
miaw
here
comes
the
cat
to
eat
you
up
agnes
sprang
to
her
feet
in
terror
and
rushed
to
willie
she
had
so
fully
fancied
herself
a
bird
that
the
very
mention
of
the
cat
had
filled
her
with
horror
once
more
she
took
her
thumb
from
her
mouth
to
give
a
little
scream
and
did
not
put
it
in
again
o
willie
you
frightened
me
so
she
said
joining
however
in
his
laugh
poor
birdie
said
willie
did
the
naughty
puss
frighten
it
stwoke
its
fedders
stwoke
it
stwoke
it
he
continued
smoothing
down
her
hair
but
it
be
nice
persisted
agnes
to
be
so
tall
as
the
birds
can
make
themselves
with
their
wings
fancy
having
your
head
up
there
in
the
green
leaves
so
cool
and
hearing
them
all
whisper
whisper
about
your
ears
and
being
able
to
look
down
on
people
heads
you
know
willie
i
do
wish
i
was
a
bird
i
do
but
with
willie
to
comfort
and
play
with
her
she
soon
forgot
her
soaring
ambition
willie
however
did
not
forget
it
if
agnes
wished
to
enjoy
the
privacy
of
the
leaves
up
in
the
height
of
the
trees
why
should
she
at
least
why
should
she
if
he
could
help
her
to
it
certainly
he
could
change
her
arms
into
wings
or
cover
her
with
feathers
or
make
her
bones
hollow
so
that
the
air
might
get
all
through
her
even
into
her
quills
but
he
could
get
her
up
into
the
tree
and
even
something
more
perhaps
he
would
see
about
it
that
is
he
would
think
about
it
for
how
it
was
to
be
done
he
did
not
yet
see
long
ago
almost
the
moment
he
arrived
he
had
set
his
wheel
in
order
and
got
his
into
working
trim
and
now
more
than
ever
he
enjoyed
being
pulled
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
especially
in
the
fine
weather
for
then
in
that
hushed
hour
when
the
night
is
just
melting
into
the
morn
and
the
earth
looks
as
if
she
were
losing
her
dreams
yet
had
not
begun
to
recognise
her
own
thoughts
he
would
not
unfrequently
go
out
into
the
garden
and
wander
about
for
a
few
thoughtful
minutes
the
same
night
when
his
wheel
pulled
him
he
rose
and
went
out
into
the
garden
the
night
was
at
odds
with
morning
which
was
which
an
occasional
bat
would
flit
like
a
doubtful
shadow
across
his
eyes
but
a
cool
breath
of
air
was
roaming
about
as
well
which
was
not
of
the
night
at
all
but
plainly
belonged
to
the
morning
he
wandered
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
to
the
clump
of
trees
lay
down
where
agnes
had
been
lying
the
night
before
and
thought
and
thought
until
he
felt
in
himself
how
the
child
had
felt
when
she
longed
to
be
a
bird
what
could
he
do
to
content
her
he
knew
every
bough
of
the
old
trees
himself
having
scrambled
over
them
like
a
squirrel
scores
of
times
but
even
if
he
could
get
agnes
up
the
bare
bole
of
an
elm
or
fir
he
could
not
trust
her
to
go
scrambling
about
the
branches
on
the
other
hand
wherever
he
could
go
he
could
surely
somehow
help
agnes
to
go
having
gathered
a
thought
or
two
he
went
back
to
bed
the
very
next
evening
he
set
to
work
and
spent
the
whole
of
that
and
the
following
at
his
bench
planing
and
shaping
and
generally
preparing
for
a
construction
the
plan
of
which
was
now
clear
in
his
head
at
length
on
the
third
evening
he
carried
half
a
dozen
long
poles
and
wheeled
several
barrowfuls
of
short
planks
measuring
but
a
few
inches
over
two
feet
down
to
the
clump
of
trees
at
the
foot
of
the
largest
elm
he
began
to
dig
with
the
intention
of
inserting
the
thick
end
of
one
of
the
poles
but
he
soon
found
it
impossible
to
get
half
deep
enough
because
of
the
tremendous
roots
of
the
tree
and
giving
it
up
thought
of
a
better
plan
he
set
off
to
the
smithy
and
bought
of
mr
willett
some
fifteen
feet
of
iron
rod
with
a
dozen
staples
carrying
them
home
to
his
small
forge
he
cut
the
rod
into
equal
lengths
of
a
little
over
two
feet
and
made
a
hook
at
both
ends
of
each
length
then
he
carried
them
down
to
the
elm
and
drove
six
of
the
staples
into
the
bole
of
the
tree
at
equal
distances
all
round
it
a
foot
from
the
ground
the
others
he
drove
one
into
each
of
the
six
poles
a
foot
from
the
thick
end
after
which
he
connected
the
poles
with
the
tree
each
by
a
hooked
rod
and
its
corresponding
staples
when
the
tops
of
the
poles
just
reached
to
the
first
fork
of
the
elm
then
he
nailed
a
bracket
to
the
tree
at
the
height
of
an
easy
step
from
the
ground
and
at
the
same
height
nailed
a
piece
of
wood
across
between
two
of
the
poles
resting
on
the
bracket
and
this
piece
of
wood
he
laid
the
first
step
of
a
stair
and
fastened
it
firmly
to
both
another
bracket
a
little
higher
and
another
piece
of
wood
nailed
to
two
poles
raised
the
next
step
and
so
he
went
round
and
round
the
tree
in
an
ascending
spiral
climbing
on
the
steps
already
placed
to
fix
others
above
them
encircling
the
tree
some
four
or
five
times
for
he
wanted
the
ascent
easy
for
little
feet
he
was
at
length
at
its
fork
there
he
laid
a
platform
or
and
paused
to
consider
what
to
do
next
this
was
on
the
third
evening
from
the
laying
of
the
first
step
from
the
fork
many
boughs
rose
and
spread
amongst
them
two
very
near
each
other
between
which
he
saw
how
by
help
of
various
inequalities
he
might
build
a
little
straight
staircase
leading
up
into
a
perfect
wilderness
of
leaves
and
branches
he
set
about
it
at
once
and
although
he
found
it
more
difficult
than
he
had
expected
succeeded
at
last
in
building
a
safe
stair
between
the
boughs
with
a
of
rope
on
each
side
but
willie
had
chosen
to
ascend
in
this
direction
for
another
reason
as
well
one
of
these
boughs
was
in
close
contact
with
a
bough
belonging
to
one
of
the
largest
of
the
red
firs
on
this
he
constructed
a
upon
which
it
was
as
easy
as
possible
to
step
from
the
stair
in
the
elm
next
the
bough
being
very
large
he
laid
along
it
a
plank
steadied
by
blocks
underneath
a
level
for
the
little
feet
then
he
began
to
weave
a
network
of
rope
and
string
along
each
side
of
the
bough
so
that
the
child
could
not
fall
off
but
finding
this
rather
a
long
job
and
thinking
it
a
pity
to
balk
her
of
so
much
pleasure
merely
for
the
sake
of
surprising
her
the
more
thoroughly
he
resolved
to
reveal
what
he
had
already
done
and
permit
her
to
enjoy
it
for
as
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
sooner
he
had
taken
mona
into
his
confidence
and
she
had
kept
agnes
out
of
the
way
for
now
nearly
a
whole
week
of
evenings
but
she
was
finding
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
restrain
her
from
rushing
off
in
search
of
willie
and
was
very
glad
indeed
when
he
told
her
that
he
was
not
going
to
keep
the
thing
a
secret
any
longer
illustration
willie
carried
agnes
up
the
stair
into
the
great
branches
of
the
elm
tree
chapter
xxi
how
agnes
liked
being
a
bird
but
willie
began
to
think
whether
he
might
not
give
agnes
two
surprises
out
of
it
with
a
dream
into
the
bargain
and
thought
over
it
until
he
saw
how
he
could
manage
it
she
always
went
to
bed
at
seven
so
that
by
the
time
the
other
people
in
the
house
began
to
think
of
retiring
she
was
generally
fast
asleep
about
ten
therefore
the
next
night
just
as
a
great
round
moon
was
peering
above
the
horizon
with
a
quantity
of
mackerel
clouds
ready
to
receive
her
when
she
rose
a
yard
or
two
higher
willie
taking
a
soft
shawl
of
his
mother
went
into
agnes
room
and
having
wrapped
her
in
the
shawl
with
a
corner
of
it
over
her
head
and
face
carried
her
out
into
the
garden
down
to
the
trees
and
up
the
stair
into
the
midst
of
the
great
boughs
and
branches
of
the
elm
tree
it
was
a
very
warm
night
with
a
soft
breath
of
south
wind
blowing
and
there
was
no
risk
of
her
taking
cold
he
uncovered
her
face
but
did
not
wake
her
leaving
that
to
the
change
of
her
position
and
the
freshness
of
the
air
nor
was
he
disappointed
in
a
few
moments
she
began
to
stir
then
her
eyes
then
shut
them
then
opened
them
again
then
rubbed
them
then
drew
a
deep
breath
and
then
began
to
lift
her
head
from
willie
shoulder
and
look
about
her
through
the
thick
leaves
the
moon
was
shining
like
a
great
white
fire
and
must
have
looked
to
her
sleepy
eyes
almost
within
a
yard
of
her
even
if
she
had
not
been
half
asleep
so
beheld
through
the
leaves
it
would
have
taken
her
a
while
to
make
up
her
mind
what
the
huge
bright
thing
was
then
she
heard
a
great
fluttering
as
if
the
leaves
were
talking
to
her
and
out
of
them
came
a
soft
wind
that
blew
in
her
face
and
felt
very
sweet
and
pleasant
she
rubbed
her
eyes
again
but
could
not
get
the
sleep
out
of
them
as
last
she
said
to
willie
who
stood
as
still
as
a
stone
but
her
tongue
and
her
voice
and
her
lips
could
hardly
make
the
words
she
wanted
them
to
utter
am
i
awake
am
i
dreaming
it
so
nice
willie
did
not
answer
her
and
the
little
head
sunk
on
his
shoulder
again
he
drew
the
corner
of
the
shawl
over
it
and
carried
her
back
to
her
bed
when
he
had
laid
her
down
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
stared
him
in
the
face
for
a
moment
as
if
she
knew
all
about
everything
except
just
what
she
was
looking
at
put
her
thumb
in
her
mouth
and
was
fast
asleep
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
her
papa
out
and
her
mamma
not
yet
come
down
she
told
willie
that
she
had
had
such
a
beautiful
dream
that
an
angel
with
great
red
wings
came
and
took
her
in
his
arms
and
flew
up
and
up
with
her
to
a
cloud
that
lay
close
by
the
moon
and
there
stopped
the
cloud
was
made
all
of
little
birds
that
kept
fluttering
their
wings
and
talking
to
each
other
and
the
fluttering
of
their
wings
made
a
wind
in
her
face
and
the
wind
made
her
very
happy
and
the
moon
kept
looking
through
the
birds
quite
close
to
them
and
smiling
at
her
and
she
saw
the
face
of
the
man
in
the
moon
quite
plain
but
then
it
grew
dark
and
began
to
thunder
and
the
angel
went
down
very
fast
and
the
thunder
was
the
clapping
of
his
big
red
wings
and
he
flew
with
her
into
her
mamma
room
and
laid
her
down
in
her
crib
and
when
she
looked
at
him
he
was
so
like
willie
do
you
think
the
dream
could
have
come
of
your
wishing
to
be
a
bird
agnes
asked
willie
i
do
know
perhaps
replied
agnes
are
you
angry
with
me
for
wishing
i
was
a
bird
willie
no
darling
what
makes
you
ask
such
a
question
because
ever
since
then
you
wo
let
me
go
with
you
when
you
are
doing
things
you
know
why
you
were
in
the
laboratory
with
me
yesterday
said
willie
yes
but
you
would
have
me
in
the
evening
when
you
used
to
let
me
be
with
you
always
what
are
you
doing
down
amongst
the
trees
now
if
you
will
have
patience
and
not
go
near
them
all
day
i
will
show
you
in
the
evening
agnes
promised
and
willie
gave
the
whole
day
to
getting
things
on
a
bit
amongst
other
things
he
wove
such
a
network
along
the
bough
of
the
scotch
fir
that
it
was
quite
safe
for
agnes
to
walk
on
it
down
to
the
great
red
hole
of
the
tree
there
he
was
content
to
make
a
pause
for
the
present
constructing
first
however
a
little
chair
of
bough
and
branch
and
rope
and
twig
in
which
she
could
safely
sit
just
as
he
had
finished
the
chair
he
heard
her
voice
calling
in
a
tone
that
grew
more
and
more
pitiful
willie
willie
willie
willie
he
got
down
and
ran
to
find
her
she
was
at
the
window
of
his
room
where
she
had
gone
to
wait
till
he
called
her
but
her
patience
had
at
last
given
way
i
tired
willie
may
i
come
yet
wait
just
one
moment
more
said
willie
and
ran
to
the
house
for
his
mother
shawl
as
soon
as
he
began
to
wrap
it
about
her
agnes
said
thoughtfully
somebody
did
that
to
me
before
not
long
ago
i
remember
it
was
the
angel
in
my
dream
when
willie
put
the
corner
over
her
face
she
said
he
did
that
too
and
when
he
took
her
in
his
arms
she
said
he
did
that
too
how
funny
you
should
do
just
what
the
angel
did
in
my
dream
willie
ran
about
with
her
here
and
there
through
the
ruins
into
the
house
up
and
down
the
stairs
and
through
the
garden
in
many
directions
until
he
was
satisfied
he
must
have
thoroughly
bewildered
her
as
to
whereabouts
they
were
and
then
at
last
sped
with
her
up
the
stair
to
the
fork
of
the
there
he
threw
back
the
shawl
and
told
her
to
look
to
see
her
first
utterly
bewildered
expression
then
the
slow
glimmering
dawn
of
intelligence
as
she
began
to
understand
where
she
was
next
the
gradual
rise
of
light
in
her
face
as
if
it
came
there
from
some
spring
down
below
until
it
broke
out
in
a
smile
all
over
it
when
at
length
she
perceived
that
this
was
what
he
had
been
working
at
and
why
he
would
have
her
with
him
gave
willie
all
the
pleasure
he
had
hoped
for
quite
satisfied
him
and
made
him
count
his
labour
well
rewarded
o
willie
willie
it
was
all
for
me
was
it
now
yes
it
was
pet
said
willie
it
was
all
to
make
a
bird
of
me
was
it
she
went
on
yes
as
much
of
a
bird
as
i
could
i
could
give
you
wings
you
know
and
i
had
any
of
my
own
to
fly
up
with
you
to
the
moon
as
the
angel
in
your
dream
did
the
dream
was
much
nicer
was
it
i
not
sure
about
that
really
i
not
i
think
it
is
nicer
to
have
a
wind
coming
you
do
know
from
where
and
making
all
the
leaves
flutter
about
than
to
have
the
wings
of
birdies
making
the
wind
and
i
care
about
the
man
in
the
moon
much
he
not
so
nice
as
you
willie
and
yon
red
ray
of
the
sun
through
there
on
the
is
as
good
nearly
as
the
moon
oh
but
you
may
have
the
moon
if
you
wait
a
bit
she
be
too
late
though
but
now
i
think
of
it
willie
said
agnes
i
do
believe
it
was
a
dream
at
all
do
you
think
a
real
angel
carried
you
really
up
to
the
moon
then
asked
willie
no
but
a
real
willie
carried
me
really
up
into
this
tree
and
the
moon
shone
through
the
leaves
and
i
thought
they
were
birds
you
my
angel
willie
only
better
to
me
than
twenty
hundred
angels
and
agnes
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
hugged
and
kissed
him
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
that
is
as
soon
as
she
ceased
choking
him
he
said
you
up
in
this
tree
last
night
and
the
wind
was
fluttering
the
leaves
and
the
moon
was
shining
through
them
and
you
carried
me
in
this
shawl
and
that
was
the
red
wings
of
the
angel
cried
agnes
dancing
with
delight
yes
pet
i
daresay
it
was
but
are
you
sorry
to
lose
your
big
angel
the
angel
was
only
in
a
dream
and
you
here
willie
besides
be
a
big
angel
some
day
willie
and
then
you
have
wings
and
be
able
to
fly
me
about
but
you
have
wings
of
your
own
then
and
be
able
to
fly
without
me
but
i
fold
them
up
sometimes
may
i
for
it
would
be
much
nicer
to
be
carried
by
wings
sometimes
you
know
look
look
willie
look
at
the
sunbeam
on
the
trunk
of
the
fir
how
red
it
got
i
do
wish
i
could
have
a
peep
at
the
sun
where
can
he
be
i
should
see
him
if
i
were
to
go
into
his
beam
there
should
i
he
shining
past
the
end
of
the
cottage
said
willie
go
and
see
him
go
where
asked
agnes
into
the
red
sunbeam
on
the
i
have
got
my
wings
yet
willie
that
what
people
very
often
say
when
they
not
inclined
to
try
what
they
can
do
with
their
legs
but
i
ca
go
there
willie
you
have
tried
how
am
i
to
try
you
not
even
trying
to
try
you
standing
talking
and
saying
you
ca
it
was
nearly
all
agnes
could
do
to
keep
from
crying
but
she
felt
she
must
do
something
more
lest
willie
should
be
vexed
there
seemed
but
one
way
to
get
nearer
to
the
sunbeam
and
that
was
to
go
down
this
tree
and
run
to
the
foot
of
the
other
what
if
willie
had
made
a
stair
up
it
also
but
as
she
turned
to
see
how
she
was
to
go
down
for
she
had
been
carried
up
blind
she
caught
sight
of
the
straight
staircase
between
the
two
boughs
and
with
a
shriek
of
delight
up
she
ran
gently
gently
do
bring
the
tree
down
with
your
tremendous
weight
cried
willie
following
her
close
behind
at
the
end
of
the
stairs
she
sprang
upon
the
bough
of
the
fir
and
in
a
moment
more
was
sitting
in
the
full
light
of
the
sunset
o
willie
willie
this
grand
how
good
how
kind
of
you
you
made
a
bird
of
me
what
will
papa
and
mamma
say
wo
they
be
delighted
i
must
run
and
fetch
mona
so
saying
she
hurried
across
again
and
down
the
stair
and
away
to
look
for
mona
shepherd
shouting
with
delight
as
she
ran
in
a
few
minutes
her
cries
had
gathered
the
whole
house
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
as
well
as
mr
shepherd
and
mona
and
mrs
hunter
mr
macmichael
and
all
of
them
went
up
into
the
tree
mr
shepherd
last
and
with
some
misgivings
for
having
no
mechanical
faculty
himself
he
could
not
rightly
value
willie
and
feared
that
he
might
not
have
made
the
stair
safe
but
mr
macmichael
soon
satisfied
him
showing
him
how
strong
and
firm
willie
had
made
every
part
of
it
the
next
evening
willie
went
on
with
his
plan
which
was
to
make
a
way
for
bird
agnes
from
one
tree
to
another
over
the
whole
of
the
clump
it
took
him
many
evenings
however
to
complete
it
and
a
good
many
more
to
construct
in
the
elm
tree
a
thin
wooden
house
cunningly
perched
upon
several
of
the
strongest
boughs
and
branches
he
called
it
bird
nest
it
had
doors
and
windows
and
several
stories
in
it
only
the
upper
stories
did
not
rest
on
the
lower
but
upon
higher
branches
of
the
tree
to
two
of
these
he
made
stairs
and
a
to
a
third
when
the
house
was
finished
he
put
a
little
table
in
the
largest
room
and
having
got
some
light
chairs
from
the
house
asked
his
father
and
mother
and
grandmother
to
tea
in
bird
agnes
nest
but
grannie
declined
to
go
up
the
tree
she
said
climbing
days
were
over
long
ago
chapter
xxii
willie
plans
bud
either
they
were
over
or
were
only
beginning
for
the
next
winter
while
willie
was
at
college
grannie
was
taken
ill
and
although
they
sent
for
him
to
come
home
at
once
she
had
climbed
higher
ere
he
arrived
when
they
opened
her
will
they
found
that
she
had
left
everything
to
willie
there
was
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
in
ready
money
and
property
that
brought
in
about
fifty
pounds
not
much
to
one
who
would
have
spent
everything
on
himself
but
a
good
deal
to
one
who
loved
other
people
and
for
their
sakes
would
contrive
that
a
little
should
go
a
long
way
so
willie
was
henceforth
able
to
relieve
his
father
by
paying
all
his
own
college
expenses
he
laid
by
a
little
too
as
his
father
wished
him
until
he
should
see
how
best
to
use
it
his
father
always
talked
about
never
about
money
when
he
came
home
the
next
summer
he
moved
again
into
his
own
old
room
for
agnes
slept
in
a
little
closet
off
her
mother
and
much
preferred
that
to
a
larger
and
more
solitary
room
for
herself
his
mother
especially
was
glad
to
have
him
under
the
same
roof
once
more
at
night
but
willie
felt
that
something
ought
to
be
done
with
the
room
he
had
left
in
the
ruins
for
nothing
ought
to
be
allowed
to
spoil
by
uselessness
he
did
not
however
see
for
some
time
to
what
he
could
turn
it
i
need
hardly
say
that
he
kept
up
all
his
old
friendships
no
day
passed
while
he
was
at
home
without
his
going
to
see
some
one
of
his
former
companions
mr
willett
or
mr
spelman
or
mr
wilson
for
hector
he
went
to
see
him
oftenest
of
all
he
being
his
favourite
and
sickly
and
therefore
in
most
need
of
attention
but
he
greatly
improved
his
acquaintance
with
william
webster
and
although
he
had
now
so
much
to
occupy
him
would
not
be
satisfied
until
he
was
able
to
drive
the
shuttle
and
work
the
treadles
and
the
batten
and
in
short
turn
out
almost
as
good
a
bit
of
linen
as
william
himself
only
he
wanted
about
twice
as
much
time
to
it
one
day
going
in
to
see
hector
he
found
him
in
bed
and
very
poorly
my
shoemaking
is
nearly
over
mr
willie
he
said
but
i
do
mind
much
i
sure
to
find
a
corner
in
the
general
business
ready
for
me
somewhere
when
i
not
wanted
here
any
more
have
you
been
drinking
the
water
lately
asked
willie
no
i
was
very
busy
last
week
and
had
time
and
it
was
rather
cold
for
me
to
go
out
but
for
that
matter
the
wind
blew
in
through
door
and
window
so
dreadfully
and
it
but
a
clay
floor
and
firing
is
dear
that
i
caught
a
cold
and
a
cold
is
the
worst
thing
for
me
that
is
for
this
poor
rickety
body
of
mine
and
this
cold
is
a
bad
one
here
a
great
fit
of
coughing
came
on
accompanied
by
symptoms
that
willie
saw
were
dangerous
and
he
went
home
at
once
to
get
him
some
medicine
on
the
way
back
a
thought
struck
him
about
which
however
he
would
say
nothing
to
hector
until
he
should
have
talked
to
his
father
and
mother
about
it
which
he
did
that
same
evening
at
supper
i
tell
you
what
hector
he
said
when
he
went
to
see
him
the
next
day
you
must
come
and
occupy
my
room
in
the
ruins
since
grannie
went
home
i
do
want
it
and
it
a
pity
to
have
it
lying
idle
it
a
deal
warmer
than
this
and
i
get
a
stove
in
before
the
winter
you
have
to
work
so
hard
when
you
got
no
rent
to
pay
and
you
will
have
as
much
of
the
water
as
you
like
without
the
trouble
of
walking
up
the
hill
for
it
then
there
the
garden
for
you
to
walk
in
when
you
please
all
on
a
level
and
only
the
little
stair
to
climb
to
get
back
to
your
own
room
but
i
should
be
such
a
trouble
to
you
all
mr
willie
you
be
no
trouble
we
two
servants
now
if
you
like
you
can
give
the
little
one
a
shilling
now
and
then
and
she
be
glad
enough
to
make
your
bed
and
sweep
out
your
room
and
you
know
tibby
has
a
great
regard
for
you
and
will
be
very
glad
to
do
all
the
cooking
you
will
want
it
not
much
i
know
your
porridge
and
a
cup
of
tea
is
about
all
and
then
there
my
father
to
look
after
your
health
and
agnes
to
amuse
you
sometimes
and
my
mother
to
look
after
everything
and
here
poor
hector
fairly
broke
down
when
he
recovered
himself
he
said
but
how
could
gentle
folks
like
you
bear
to
see
a
creature
like
me
crawling
about
the
place
they
would
only
enjoy
it
the
more
that
you
enjoyed
it
said
willie
it
was
all
arranged
as
soon
as
hector
was
able
to
be
moved
he
was
carried
up
to
the
ruins
and
there
nursed
by
everybody
nothing
could
exceed
his
comfort
now
but
his
gratitude
he
was
soon
able
to
work
again
and
as
he
was
evidently
happier
when
doing
a
little
towards
the
general
business
mr
macmichael
thought
it
best
for
him
one
day
willie
being
at
work
in
his
laboratory
and
getting
himself
with
a
sudden
fume
of
chlorine
opened
the
door
for
some
air
just
as
hector
had
passed
it
he
stood
at
the
door
and
followed
him
down
the
walk
with
his
eyes
watching
him
as
he
went
now
disappearing
behind
the
blossoms
of
an
now
climbing
one
of
the
little
mounds
and
now
getting
up
into
the
and
looking
about
him
on
all
sides
his
sickly
face
absolutely
shining
with
pleasure
but
said
willie
all
at
once
to
himself
why
should
hector
be
the
only
invalid
to
have
this
pleasure
he
found
no
answer
to
the
question
i
do
think
he
looked
for
one
very
hard
though
and
again
all
at
once
he
said
to
himself
what
if
this
is
what
my
grannie
money
was
given
me
for
that
night
he
had
a
dream
the
two
questions
had
no
doubt
a
share
in
giving
it
him
and
perhaps
also
a
certain
essay
of
lord
bacon
of
building
namely
which
he
had
been
reading
before
he
went
to
bed
illustration
willie
dream
he
dreamed
that
being
pulled
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
his
wheel
he
went
down
to
go
into
the
garden
but
the
moment
he
was
out
of
the
back
door
he
fancied
there
was
something
strange
going
on
in
his
room
in
the
ruins
he
could
not
tell
what
but
he
must
go
and
see
when
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
opened
the
door
there
was
hector
macallaster
where
he
ought
to
be
asleep
in
his
bed
but
there
something
strange
going
on
for
a
stream
which
came
dashing
over
the
side
of
the
wooden
spout
was
flowing
all
round
hector
bed
and
then
away
he
knew
not
whither
another
strange
thing
was
that
in
the
further
wall
was
a
door
which
was
new
to
him
he
opened
it
and
found
himself
in
another
chamber
like
his
own
and
there
also
lay
some
one
he
knew
not
who
in
a
bed
with
a
stream
of
water
flowing
all
around
it
there
was
also
a
second
door
beyond
which
was
a
third
room
and
a
third
patient
asleep
and
a
third
stream
flowing
around
the
bed
and
a
third
door
beyond
he
went
from
room
to
room
on
and
on
through
about
a
hundred
such
he
thought
and
at
length
came
to
a
vaulted
chamber
which
seemed
to
be
over
the
well
from
the
centre
of
the
vault
rose
a
great
chimney
and
under
the
chimney
was
a
huge
fire
and
on
the
fire
stood
a
mighty
golden
cauldron
up
to
which
through
a
large
pipe
came
the
water
of
the
well
and
went
pouring
in
with
a
great
rushing
and
hissing
and
bubbling
from
the
other
side
of
the
cauldron
the
water
rushed
away
through
another
pipe
into
the
trough
that
ran
through
all
the
chambers
and
made
the
rivers
that
flowed
the
beds
of
the
sleeping
patients
and
what
was
most
wonderful
of
all
by
the
fire
stood
two
angels
with
grand
lovely
wings
and
they
made
a
great
fanning
with
their
wings
and
so
blew
the
fire
up
loud
and
strong
about
the
golden
cauldron
and
when
willie
looked
into
their
faces
he
saw
that
one
of
them
was
his
father
and
the
other
mr
shepherd
and
he
gave
a
great
cry
of
delight
and
woke
weeping
chapter
xxiii
willie
plans
blossom
in
the
morning
willie
head
was
full
of
his
dream
how
gladly
would
he
have
turned
it
into
a
reality
that
was
impossible
but
might
he
not
do
something
towards
it
he
had
long
ago
seen
that
those
who
are
doomed
not
to
realise
their
ideal
are
just
those
who
will
not
take
the
first
step
towards
it
oh
this
is
such
a
little
thing
to
do
it
ca
be
any
use
they
say
and
it
such
a
distance
off
what
i
mean
and
what
i
should
give
my
life
to
have
they
think
and
they
say
that
they
would
give
their
life
for
it
and
yet
they
will
not
give
a
single
hearty
effort
hence
they
just
stop
where
they
are
or
rather
go
back
and
back
until
they
do
not
care
a
bit
for
the
thoughts
they
used
to
think
so
great
that
they
cherished
them
for
the
glory
of
having
thought
them
but
even
the
wretched
people
who
set
their
hearts
on
making
money
begin
by
saving
the
first
penny
they
can
and
then
the
next
and
the
next
and
they
have
their
reward
they
get
the
riches
they
want
with
the
loss
of
their
souls
to
be
sure
but
that
they
did
not
think
of
the
people
on
the
other
hand
who
want
to
be
noble
and
good
begin
by
taking
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
their
hand
and
doing
that
right
and
so
they
go
on
from
one
thing
to
another
growing
better
and
better
in
the
same
way
although
it
would
have
been
absurd
in
willie
to
rack
his
brain
for
some
scheme
by
which
to
restore
such
a
grand
building
as
the
priory
he
could
yet
bethink
himself
that
the
hundredth
room
did
not
come
next
the
first
neither
did
the
third
the
one
after
the
first
was
the
second
and
he
might
do
something
towards
the
existence
of
that
he
went
out
immediately
after
breakfast
and
began
peering
about
the
ruins
to
see
where
the
second
room
might
be
to
his
delight
he
saw
that
with
a
little
contrivance
it
could
be
built
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
of
hector
room
he
had
plenty
of
money
for
it
his
grannie
legacy
not
being
yet
touched
he
thought
it
all
over
himself
talked
it
all
over
with
his
father
and
then
consulted
it
all
over
with
spelman
the
end
was
that
without
nearly
spending
his
little
store
he
had
before
the
time
came
for
his
return
to
the
college
built
another
room
as
the
garret
was
full
of
his
grandmother
furniture
nothing
was
easier
than
to
fit
it
up
and
that
very
nicely
too
it
remained
only
to
find
an
occupant
for
it
this
would
have
been
easy
enough
also
without
going
far
from
the
door
but
both
willie
and
his
father
were
practical
men
and
therefore
could
not
be
content
with
merely
doing
good
they
wanted
to
do
as
much
good
as
they
could
it
would
not
therefore
satisfy
them
to
put
into
their
new
room
such
a
person
say
as
mrs
wilson
who
could
get
on
pretty
well
where
she
was
though
she
might
have
been
made
more
comfortable
but
suppose
they
could
find
the
sickly
mother
of
a
large
family
whom
a
few
weeks
of
change
with
the
fine
air
from
the
hills
and
the
wonderful
water
from
the
prior
well
would
restore
to
strength
and
cheerfulness
how
much
more
good
would
they
not
be
doing
in
that
way
seeing
that
to
help
a
mother
with
children
is
to
help
all
the
children
as
well
not
to
mention
the
husband
and
the
friends
of
the
family
there
were
plenty
such
to
be
found
amongst
the
patients
he
had
to
attend
while
at
college
the
expense
of
living
was
not
great
at
priory
leas
and
mr
macmichael
was
willing
to
bear
that
if
only
to
test
the
influences
of
the
water
and
climate
upon
strangers
although
it
was
not
by
any
means
the
best
season
for
the
experiment
it
was
yet
thoroughly
successful
with
the
pale
rheumatic
mother
of
six
whom
willie
first
sent
home
to
his
father
care
she
returned
to
her
children
at
christmas
comparatively
a
hale
woman
capable
of
making
them
and
everybody
about
her
twice
as
happy
as
before
another
as
nearly
like
her
in
bodily
condition
and
circumstances
as
he
could
find
took
her
place
with
a
like
result
and
before
long
the
healing
that
hovered
about
priory
leas
began
to
be
known
and
talked
of
amongst
the
professors
of
the
college
and
the
medical
men
of
the
city
chapter
xxiv
willie
plans
bear
fruit
when
his
studies
were
finished
willie
returned
to
assist
his
father
for
he
had
no
desire
to
settle
in
a
great
city
with
the
ambition
of
becoming
a
fashionable
doctor
getting
large
fees
and
growing
rich
he
regarded
the
end
of
life
as
being
in
a
large
measure
just
to
take
his
share
in
the
general
business
by
this
time
the
reputation
of
the
prior
well
had
spread
on
all
sides
and
the
country
people
had
begun
to
visit
the
leas
and
stay
for
a
week
or
ten
days
to
drink
of
the
water
indeed
so
many
kept
coming
and
going
at
all
hours
through
the
garden
that
the
macmichaels
at
length
found
it
very
troublesome
and
had
a
small
pipe
laid
to
a
little
stone
trough
built
into
the
garden
wall
on
the
outside
so
that
whoever
would
might
come
and
drink
with
less
trouble
to
all
concerned
but
willie
had
come
home
with
a
new
idea
in
his
head
an
old
valetudinarian
in
the
city
who
knew
every
spa
in
europe
wanted
to
try
that
of
priory
leas
and
had
consulted
him
about
it
finding
that
there
was
no
such
accommodation
to
be
had
as
he
judged
suitable
he
seriously
advised
willie
to
build
a
house
fit
for
persons
of
position
as
he
called
them
assuring
him
that
they
would
soon
make
their
fortunes
if
they
did
now
although
as
i
have
said
this
was
not
the
ambition
of
either
father
or
son
for
a
fortune
had
never
seemed
to
either
worth
taking
trouble
about
yet
it
suggested
something
that
was
better
why
said
willie
to
his
father
should
we
restore
a
bit
of
the
priory
in
such
a
way
that
a
man
like
mr
yellowley
could
endure
it
for
a
little
while
he
would
pay
us
well
and
then
we
should
be
able
to
do
more
for
those
that
ca
pay
us
we
could
cook
for
a
man
like
that
said
his
mother
he
would
want
that
said
his
father
he
would
be
sure
to
bring
his
own
servants
the
result
was
that
mr
macmichael
thought
the
thing
worth
trying
and
resolved
to
lay
out
all
his
little
savings
as
well
as
what
willie
could
add
on
getting
a
kitchen
and
a
few
convenient
rooms
constructed
in
the
ruins
of
course
keeping
as
much
as
possible
to
their
plan
and
architectural
character
he
found
however
that
it
would
want
a
good
deal
more
than
they
could
manage
to
scrape
together
between
them
and
was
on
the
point
of
giving
up
the
scheme
or
at
least
altering
it
for
one
that
would
have
been
much
longer
in
making
them
any
return
when
mr
shepherd
who
had
become
acquainted
with
their
plans
and
consequently
with
their
difficulties
offered
to
join
them
with
the
little
he
had
laid
aside
for
a
rainy
day
which
proved
just
sufficient
to
complete
the
sum
necessary
between
the
three
the
thing
was
effected
and
mr
yellowley
was
their
first
visitor
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
grumbled
a
good
deal
at
first
at
the
proximity
of
the
cobbler
and
at
having
to
meet
him
in
his
walks
about
the
garden
but
this
was
a
point
on
which
mr
macmichael
who
of
course
took
the
old
man
complaints
would
not
budge
and
he
had
to
reconcile
himself
to
it
as
he
best
might
nor
was
it
very
difficult
after
he
found
he
must
before
long
they
became
excellent
friends
for
if
you
will
only
give
time
and
opportunity
in
an
ordinarily
good
man
nature
will
overcome
in
the
end
mr
yellowley
was
at
heart
and
the
cobbler
was
well
worth
knowing
before
the
former
left
the
two
were
often
to
be
seen
pacing
the
garden
together
and
talking
happily
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
recount
all
the
gradations
of
growth
by
which
room
after
room
arose
from
the
ruins
of
the
priory
when
mr
yellowley
went
away
after
nearly
six
months
sojourn
during
the
latter
part
of
which
so
wonderfully
was
he
restored
by
the
air
and
the
water
and
the
medical
care
of
mr
macmichael
he
enjoyed
a
little
shooting
on
the
hills
he
paid
him
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
for
accommodation
and
medical
attendance
no
great
sum
as
money
goes
but
a
good
return
in
six
months
for
the
outlay
of
a
thousand
pounds
this
they
laid
by
to
accumulate
for
the
next
addition
and
the
priory
having
once
taken
to
growing
went
on
with
it
they
cleared
away
mound
after
mound
from
the
garden
turning
them
once
more
into
solid
walls
for
they
were
formed
mainly
of
excellent
stones
which
had
just
been
waiting
to
be
put
up
again
the
only
evil
consequence
was
that
the
garden
became
a
little
less
picturesque
by
their
removal
although
on
the
other
hand
a
good
deal
more
productive
yes
there
was
a
second
apparently
bad
consequence
the
priory
spread
as
well
as
grew
until
it
encroached
not
a
little
upon
the
garden
but
for
this
a
remedy
soon
appeared
the
next
house
and
garden
although
called
the
manse
because
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
lived
there
were
mr
shepherd
own
property
the
ruins
formed
a
great
part
of
the
boundary
between
the
two
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
the
priory
had
extended
a
good
way
into
what
was
now
the
other
garden
indeed
mr
shepherd
house
as
well
as
mr
macmichael
had
been
built
out
of
the
ruins
mr
shepherd
offered
to
have
the
wall
thrown
down
and
the
building
extended
on
his
side
as
well
so
that
it
should
stand
in
the
middle
of
one
large
garden
my
readers
need
not
put
a
question
as
to
what
would
have
become
of
it
if
the
two
proprietors
had
quarrelled
for
it
had
become
less
likely
than
ever
that
such
a
thing
should
happen
willie
had
told
mona
that
he
loved
her
more
that
he
could
tell
and
wanted
to
ask
her
a
question
only
he
did
know
how
and
mona
had
told
willie
that
she
would
suppose
his
question
if
he
would
suppose
her
answer
and
willie
had
said
may
i
suppose
it
to
be
the
very
answer
i
should
like
and
mona
had
answered
yes
quite
decidedly
and
willie
had
given
her
a
kiss
and
mona
had
taken
the
kiss
and
given
him
another
for
it
and
so
it
was
all
understood
and
there
was
no
fear
of
the
wall
having
to
be
built
up
again
between
the
gardens
so
the
priory
grew
and
flourished
and
gained
great
reputation
and
the
fame
of
the
two
doctors
father
and
son
spread
far
and
wide
for
the
cures
they
wrought
and
many
people
came
and
paid
them
large
sums
but
the
more
rich
people
that
came
the
more
poor
people
they
invited
for
they
never
would
allow
the
making
of
money
to
intrude
upon
the
dignity
of
their
high
calling
how
should
avarice
and
cure
go
together
greedy
healer
of
what
a
marriage
of
words
the
priory
became
quite
a
grand
building
the
chapel
grew
up
again
and
had
windows
of
stained
glass
that
shone
like
jewels
and
mr
shepherd
having
preached
in
the
parish
church
in
the
morning
always
preached
in
the
priory
chapel
on
the
sunday
evening
and
all
the
patients
and
any
one
besides
that
pleased
went
to
hear
him
they
built
great
baths
hot
and
cold
and
of
all
kinds
from
baths
where
people
could
swim
to
baths
where
they
were
only
showered
on
by
a
very
sharp
rain
it
was
a
great
and
admirable
place
after
the
two
fathers
died
mona
had
a
picture
of
willie
dream
painted
with
portraits
of
them
as
the
two
angels
this
is
the
story
of
