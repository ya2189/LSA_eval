april
i
never
thought
it
would
come
to
this
that
i
should
keep
a
diary
because
i
am
not
a
good
little
boy
nobody
ever
keeps
a
diary
except
a
boy
that
wants
to
be
an
angel
and
with
the
angels
stand
or
a
girl
that
is
in
love
or
an
old
maid
that
ca
catch
a
man
unless
she
writes
down
her
emotions
and
leaves
them
around
so
some
man
will
read
them
and
swallow
the
bait
and
not
feel
the
hook
in
his
gills
or
a
truly
good
bank
cashier
who
teaches
sunday
school
and
skips
out
for
canada
some
saturday
night
after
the
bank
closes
and
on
monday
morning
they
find
the
combination
of
the
lock
on
the
safe
changed
and
when
they
hire
a
reformed
burglar
to
open
the
lock
the
money
is
all
gone
with
the
cashier
those
are
the
only
people
that
ever
kept
a
successful
diary
but
i
had
to
promise
ma
that
i
would
keep
a
diary
so
she
could
read
it
or
i
never
could
have
got
her
consent
for
me
to
go
with
pa
on
the
road
with
a
circus
all
ma
asks
of
me
is
to
tell
the
truth
about
everything
that
happens
to
me
and
to
pa
during
the
whole
summer
and
i
have
consented
and
i
can
see
my
finish
and
pa
finish
and
ma
finish
and
the
finish
of
the
circus
that
is
going
to
take
us
along
gee
but
we
have
had
a
hot
time
at
our
house
since
pa
and
i
got
back
from
our
trip
abroad
i
brought
pa
back
in
better
health
than
he
was
when
he
went
away
but
he
has
got
so
accustomed
to
excitement
that
i
knew
something
would
be
doing
pretty
soon
so
i
was
not
surprised
when
he
told
us
at
the
breakfast
table
that
he
supposed
he
should
have
to
go
and
travel
with
a
circus
this
summer
ma
looked
at
pa
as
though
she
wanted
to
call
the
police
and
am
ambulance
to
take
him
to
the
emergency
hospital
he
looked
at
ma
and
at
me
speared
another
waffle
and
said
i
know
you
will
think
i
am
nutty
but
for
almost
ten
years
i
have
had
a
block
of
stock
in
a
circus
and
menagerie
i
went
into
it
to
help
some
young
circus
fellows
and
put
up
quite
a
bunch
of
money
because
they
were
honest
and
poor
and
for
a
few
years
things
went
wrong
and
i
thought
my
money
was
gone
but
for
the
last
six
years
the
circus
has
paid
dividends
bigger
than
standard
oil
and
today
it
stands
away
up
among
the
financial
successes
and
the
dividends
on
my
citrus
stock
is
better
than
any
bank
stock
i
have
got
and
it
comes
just
like
finding
money
the
company
decided
at
its
annual
meeting
to
invite
me
to
take
the
position
of
one
of
the
managers
and
i
shall
soon
go
to
the
winter
quarters
of
the
show
to
arrange
to
put
it
on
the
road
about
the
of
may
now
any
remarks
may
be
made
pro
or
con
in
regard
to
my
sanity
see
well
ma
swallowed
something
crosswise
down
her
sunday
throat
and
choked
and
pa
swatted
her
on
the
back
so
she
would
cough
it
up
and
when
she
could
speak
she
said
pa
do
you
have
to
wear
tights
and
jump
through
hoops
on
the
back
of
a
horse
and
cut
up
didoes
at
your
time
of
life
for
if
you
do
i
can
never
live
to
witness
any
such
performances
illustration
pa
swatted
her
on
the
back
pa
was
calm
and
did
not
fly
off
the
handle
but
he
just
said
kindly
mother
you
have
vague
ideas
of
the
duties
of
the
owners
of
a
circus
the
owners
hire
performers
to
do
stunts
and
break
their
necks
while
we
manage
them
and
take
in
the
shekels
from
the
reubens
who
come
into
town
on
circus
day
we
proprietors
touch
the
button
and
the
actors
and
animals
do
the
rest
i
shall
be
a
director
who
directs
a
man
who
sets
a
dignified
and
pious
example
to
the
men
and
women
who
adorn
the
profession
coming
as
they
do
from
all
climes
and
your
pa
will
be
the
guide
philosopher
and
friend
of
all
who
belong
to
the
grandest
aggregation
of
talent
ever
gathered
under
one
canvas
at
one
price
of
admission
and
do
not
fail
to
witness
the
concert
which
will
be
given
under
this
canvas
after
the
main
performance
is
over
ma
looked
at
pa
pretty
savage
and
said
o
i
see
you
are
going
to
be
ringmaster
but
what
is
to
become
of
hennery
and
me
while
you
are
cracking
your
whip
around
the
hind
legs
of
the
fat
woman
and
ogling
the
circassian
beauty
pa
put
his
hand
on
my
head
and
said
mother
hennery
will
go
with
me
to
see
that
i
do
not
get
into
any
trouble
as
a
circus
financier
and
general
manager
of
the
menagerie
and
wild
west
aggregation
and
hippodrome
in
the
great
circus
and
you
can
stay
home
and
give
us
absent
treatment
for
what
ails
us
and
pack
the
money
i
shall
send
you
in
bales
with
a
hay
press
and
put
it
in
cold
storage
till
we
come
back
in
the
fall
it
is
settled
we
go
to
conquer
and
the
world
will
lay
at
our
feet
before
the
middle
of
august
and
you
will
be
a
proud
woman
to
own
a
husband
who
will
be
pointed
at
as
the
most
successful
amusement
purveyor
the
world
has
ever
witnessed
and
a
son
who
will
start
in
at
the
bottom
round
of
the
circus
ladder
and
rise
step
by
step
until
he
will
stand
beside
the
great
barnum
ma
thought
seriously
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
she
said
o
pa
if
it
was
anything
but
the
circus
business
you
and
hennery
went
into
like
selling
soap
or
being
a
bank
defaulter
or
something
respectable
i
could
look
the
neighbors
in
the
face
but
of
course
if
there
is
money
in
it
and
you
feel
that
the
good
lord
has
called
you
to
the
circus
field
and
you
will
see
that
hennery
does
not
stay
out
nights
and
hennery
will
promise
to
see
that
you
put
on
a
clean
collar
occasionally
and
you
will
promise
me
that
you
will
not
let
any
of
those
circus
women
in
spangles
make
eyes
at
you
i
will
consent
to
your
going
with
the
circus
just
this
once
as
the
doctor
has
advised
that
you
lead
an
active
life
and
i
guess
you
will
get
it
traveling
with
a
circus
for
it
nearly
killed
me
that
time
i
took
hennery
to
see
the
animals
and
the
tent
blew
down
and
we
got
separated
and
the
sacred
cow
chased
ma
up
the
church
steps
and
hennery
and
a
monkey
were
brought
home
by
a
policeman
about
daylight
the
next
morning
that
time
you
were
off
fishing
and
i
never
told
you
about
going
to
the
circus
when
you
were
away
so
we
are
circus
proprietors
are
we
well
it
ai
so
bad
and
ma
went
upstairs
to
cry
at
our
success
and
pa
and
i
went
out
to
walk
off
the
effects
of
the
breaking
the
news
to
ma
illustration
sacred
cow
chased
ma
up
the
church
steps
i
had
a
long
talk
with
pa
about
our
changed
circumstances
and
asked
him
what
i
would
be
expected
to
do
in
the
show
and
he
says
i
will
fit
in
anywhere
he
says
that
a
boy
who
knows
as
much
about
everything
as
i
think
i
know
but
do
know
a
blamed
thing
about
will
be
invaluable
about
a
show
and
that
going
into
a
new
business
is
like
going
to
college
as
a
freshman
as
all
the
old
circus
men
will
haze
us
and
we
must
not
expect
an
easy
life
but
one
full
of
excitement
sleepless
nights
ginger
the
glare
of
the
torchlights
the
races
the
flying
trapeze
the
smell
of
the
sawdust
and
tanbark
the
howling
of
the
wild
beasts
and
the
plaudits
of
the
multitude
of
jays
and
jayesses
and
it
will
be
like
one
grand
circus
day
spread
all
over
the
summer
and
fall
he
says
he
wants
me
to
learn
the
circus
business
from
the
ground
up
from
the
currying
of
the
hyenas
with
a
currycomb
and
brush
to
going
up
into
the
roof
of
the
tent
on
the
trapeze
and
falling
into
the
net
while
the
audience
faints
with
excitement
i
asked
pa
if
he
wanted
me
to
keep
on
playing
tricks
on
him
while
we
were
on
the
road
and
he
said
he
had
got
so
used
to
my
tricks
that
he
could
live
without
them
and
he
did
want
me
to
let
a
chance
escape
to
make
him
have
a
good
time
april
ma
and
pa
have
had
several
discussions
about
what
kind
of
a
position
it
is
going
to
leave
her
in
among
the
neighbors
for
pa
and
i
to
go
off
with
a
circus
and
ma
wanted
to
withdraw
from
the
church
and
board
up
the
windows
of
the
house
and
make
folks
think
we
had
gone
to
the
seashore
but
pa
convinced
her
that
we
would
have
preaching
in
the
main
tent
every
sunday
and
he
says
there
is
no
more
pious
lot
of
people
on
earth
than
those
who
travel
with
a
circus
and
then
ma
wanted
to
go
along
she
said
she
could
do
the
mending
of
the
long
socks
that
the
women
wear
when
they
ride
barebacked
but
we
had
to
shut
down
on
going
with
the
show
cause
we
never
could
have
any
fun
with
a
woman
to
look
after
pa
says
nowadays
the
men
and
women
who
ride
on
bareback
horses
in
the
ring
dress
in
regular
evening
costume
the
women
with
dresses
and
long
trains
and
the
men
with
coats
and
patent
leather
shoes
and
they
are
as
polite
as
dancing
masters
we
have
compromised
with
ma
and
she
is
to
meet
the
show
at
kalamazoo
and
go
with
us
to
kankakee
and
keokuk
until
she
is
overcome
by
nervous
prostration
when
we
shall
have
her
go
home
pa
thinks
ma
would
last
about
two
days
with
the
show
but
i
guess
if
she
took
a
course
of
treatment
with
peanuts
and
red
lemonade
one
afternoon
and
evening
she
would
want
to
throw
up
her
job
and
go
back
home
in
charge
of
a
stomach
specialist
well
pa
showed
up
at
the
house
in
his
circus
clothes
this
afternoon
and
he
certainly
is
a
peach
pa
has
been
letting
his
chin
whiskers
grow
for
about
six
weeks
and
today
he
had
them
colored
black
and
he
looks
as
though
he
had
swallowed
the
blacking
brush
and
left
the
bunch
of
bristles
outside
on
his
chin
he
looks
fierce
then
he
has
got
a
new
brand
of
silk
hat
with
a
wide
curling
brim
and
he
has
had
a
vest
made
of
black
and
blue
check
goods
the
checks
as
big
as
the
checks
on
a
checker
board
and
a
pair
of
pants
that
look
like
a
rattlesnake
and
he
has
got
an
imitation
diamond
stud
in
his
white
shirt
that
looks
like
a
paper
weight
ma
wanted
to
know
if
there
was
any
law
to
compel
pa
to
dress
like
that
he
looked
as
though
he
was
a
gambler
or
a
train
robber
pa
says
that
a
circus
proprietor
has
got
to
look
different
from
anybody
else
in
order
to
inspire
fear
and
respect
on
the
part
of
the
hands
around
the
show
as
well
as
the
audiences
that
flock
to
the
arena
and
he
asked
ma
if
she
did
remember
old
dan
rice
and
old
john
robinson
ma
remember
them
but
she
remembered
barnum
because
barnum
lectured
on
temperance
and
she
said
she
hoped
pa
would
emulate
barnum
example
and
pa
said
he
would
and
then
he
took
a
watch
chain
with
links
as
big
as
a
trace
chain
and
spread
it
across
his
checkered
vest
from
one
pocket
to
the
other
with
a
gold
elk
hanging
down
the
middle
and
ma
almost
had
a
convulsion
gee
but
if
pa
wears
that
rig
in
the
menagerie
tent
the
animals
will
paw
and
bellow
like
a
drove
of
cattle
that
smell
blood
pa
is
going
to
wear
a
sack
coat
with
his
outfit
so
as
to
look
tough
and
he
would
hear
to
ma
when
she
tried
to
get
him
to
wear
a
frock
coat
he
said
a
frock
coat
was
all
right
in
society
or
among
the
crowned
heads
but
when
you
have
to
mingle
with
lions
and
elephants
one
minute
that
would
snatch
the
tail
off
a
coat
and
chew
it
and
the
next
minute
you
are
mixed
up
with
a
bunch
of
freaks
or
a
lot
of
bareback
riders
or
trapeze
performers
you
have
got
to
compromise
on
a
coat
that
will
fit
any
climate
and
not
cause
invidious
remarks
whatever
that
is
i
will
have
to
stand
up
beside
the
giant
once
in
a
while
to
show
the
difference
in
the
size
of
men
and
at
other
times
i
will
have
to
stand
beside
the
midgets
and
look
like
a
giant
myself
we
are
all
packed
up
and
in
two
days
we
start
for
the
winter
quarters
of
the
show
to
pound
it
into
shape
for
the
road
by
ginger

ca
hardly
wait
to
get
there

april
we
are
now
at
the
winter
quarters
of
the
show
in
a
little
town
on
a
farm
just
outside
where
the
tent
is
put
up
and
the
animals
are
being
cared
for
in
barns
and
the
performers
are
limbering
up
their
joints
wearing
overcoats
to
turn
and
everybody
has
a
cold
and
looks
blue
and
all
are
anxious
for
warm
weather
pa
created
a
sensation
when
we
arrived
by
his
stunning
clothes
his
jet
black
chin
whiskers
and
his
watch
chain
over
his
checkered
vest
and
when
the
proprietors
introduced
pa
to
the
performers
and
hands
as
an
old
stockholder
in
the
show
who
would
act
as
assistant
manager
during
the
season
and
pa
smiled
on
them
with
a
frown
on
his
forehead
and
said
he
hoped
his
relations
with
them
would
be
pleasant
one
of
the
old
canvasmen
remarked
to
a
girl
who
rides
two
horses
at
once
with
the
horses
strapped
together
so
they
ca
get
too
far
apart
and
cause
her
to
break
in
two
said
that
old
goat
with
the
silk
hat
would
last
just
about
four
weeks
and
that
he
reminded
the
canvasman
of
a
big
dog
which
barked
at
people
as
though
he
would
eat
them
and
at
the
same
time
wagged
his
tail
so
people
would
not
think
he
was
so
confounded
dangerous
the
principal
proprietor
of
the
circus
told
pa
to
make
himself
at
home
around
the
tent
and
not
be
offended
at
any
pleasantry
on
the
part
of
the
attaches
of
the
show
for
they
were
full
of
fun
and
he
went
off
to
attend
to
some
business
and
left
pa
with
the
gang
they
were
practicing
riding
horses
around
the
ring
with
a
rope
hitched
in
a
belt
around
the
waist
of
the
rider
and
an
arm
swinging
around
from
the
center
pole
so
if
they
fell
off
the
horse
the
rope
would
prevent
the
rider
from
falling
to
the
ground
a
practice
that
the
best
riders
adopt
early
in
the
season
the
same
as
new
beginners
they
are
all
stiffened
up
by
being
out
of
practice
one
man
rode
around
a
few
times
and
pa
got
up
close
to
the
ring
and
was
making
some
comments
such
as
why
any
condemned
fool
could
ride
a
horse
that
way
when
the
circus
gang
as
quick
as
you
could
say
scat
fastened
a
belt
around
pa
stomach
that
had
a
ring
in
it
and
before
he
knew
it
they
had
hitched
a
snap
in
the
ring
and
pa
was
hauled
up
as
high
as
the
horse
and
his
feet
rested
on
the
horse
back
and
the
horse
started
on
a
gallop
well
say
pa
was
never
so
surprised
in
his
life
but
he
dug
his
heels
into
the
horse
back
and
tried
to
look
pleasant
and
the
horse
went
half
way
around
the
ring
and
just
as
pa
was
getting
confidence
some
one
hit
the
horse
on
the
ham
with
a
piece
of
board
and
the
horse
went
out
from
under
pa
and
he
began
to
fall
over
backwards
and
i
thought
his
circus
career
would
end
right
there
when
the
man
who
had
hold
of
the
rope
pulled
up
and
pa
was
suspended
in
the
air
by
the
ring
in
the
belt
back
up
and
stomach
hanging
down
like
a
pillow
his
watch
dangling
about
a
foot
down
towards
the
ring
and
the
horse
came
around
the
ring
again
and
as
he
went
under
pa
pa
tried
to
get
his
feet
on
the
back
but
he
could
make
it
work
and
pa
said
as
cross
as
could
be
lookahere
you
fellers
you
let
me
down
or
i
will
discharge
every
mother
son
of
you
illustration
pa
was
suspended
in
the
air
but
they
did
seem
to
be
scared
for
one
man
caught
the
horse
and
let
it
out
of
the
ring
and
the
man
who
handled
the
rope
tied
it
to
the
center
pole
by
a
half
hitch
and
the
fellows
all
went
into
the
dressing
room
to
play
cinch
on
the
trunks
leaving
pa
hanging
there
just
then
the
boss
canvasman
came
along
and
he
said
hello
old
man
what
you
doing
up
there
and
pa
said
some
of
the
pirates
in
the
show
had
kidnaped
him
and
seemed
to
be
holding
him
up
for
a
ransom
and
he
said
he
would
give
ten
dollars
if
some
one
would
let
him
down
the
boss
canvasman
said
he
could
fix
it
for
ten
all
right
and
he
blew
a
whistle
and
the
gang
came
back
and
the
boss
said
bring
a
blanket
and
help
this
gentleman
down
so
they
brought
a
big
piece
of
canvas
with
handles
all
around
it
and
about
a
dozen
fellows
held
it
and
the
rope
man
let
pa
down
on
the
canvas
and
unhitched
the
ring
and
when
pa
was
in
the
canvas
he
laughed
and
said
thanks
gentlemen
i
guess
i
am
mot
much
of
a
horseback
rider
and
then
the
fellows
pulled
on
the
handles
of
the
canvas
and
by
gosh
pa
shot
up
into
the
air
to
the
top
of
the
tent
and
when
he
came
down
they
caught
him
in
the
canvas
and
tossed
him
up
a
whole
lot
of
times
until
pa
said
o
let
up
and
make
it
just
then
the
proprietor
who
had
introduced
pa
to
the
men
came
in
and
saw
what
was
going
on
and
he
said
here
you
heathen
you
quit
this
hazing
right
here
and
they
let
pa
down
on
the
floor
of
the
ring
and
he
got
up
and
pulled
his
pants
down
that
had
got
up
above
his
knees
and
shook
himself
and
took
out
his
roll
and
peeled
off
a
bill
and
gave
it
to
the
canvasman
and
he
shook
hands
with
them
all
and
said
he
liked
a
joke
as
well
as
anybody
and
for
them
to
spend
the
money
to
have
a
good
time
and
they
all
laughed
and
patted
pa
on
the
back
and
said
he
was
a
dead
game
sport
and
would
be
an
honor
to
the
profession
and
that
now
that
he
has
taken
the
first
degree
as
a
circus
man
he
could
call
on
them
for
any
sacrifice
or
any
work
and
he
would
find
that
they
would
be
johnny
on
the
spot
then
he
went
out
to
the
dining
tent
and
took
dinner
with
the
crowd
and
had
a
jolly
time
there
was
a
woman
trapeze
performer
on
one
side
of
pa
at
dinner
and
she
began
to
kick
at
once
about
the
meals
and
when
the
waiter
brought
a
piece
of
meat
to
us
all
a
great
big
piece
that
looked
like
corned
beef
she
said
for
heaven
sake
ai
that
elephant
that
died
all
been
eaten
up
yet
and
then
she
told
pa
that
they
had
been
fed
on
that
deceased
elephant
until
they
all
felt
like
they
had
trunks
growing
out
of
their
heads
and
pa
poked
the
meat
with
his
fork
and
thought
it
was
elephant
and
he
lost
his
appetite
and
everybody
laughed
i
eat
some
of
it
and
if
it
was
elephant
it
was
all
right
well
when
dinner
was
about
over
all
filled
their
glasses
to
drink
to
the
health
of
pa
the
old
stockholder
and
new
manager
and
pa
got
up
and
bowed
and
made
a
little
speech
and
when
he
sat
down
one
of
the
circus
girls
was
in
his
chair
and
he
sat
in
her
lap
and
the
crowd
all
yelled
except
a
spanish
who
seemed
to
be
the
husband
of
the
woman
pa
sat
on
and
he
wanted
pa
blood
but
the
old
circus
manager
took
him
away
to
save
pa
from
trouble
and
he
glared
back
at
pa
and
i
think
he
will
stab
pa
with
a
dirk
knife
we
got
out
of
the
dining
tent
and
went
to
the
barn
where
the
animals
are
kept
all
winter
and
pa
wanted
me
to
become
familiar
with
the
habits
of
the
beasts
they
were
to
be
in
pa
charge
with
the
keepers
of
the
different
kinds
of
animals
to
report
to
nobody
need
tell
me
that
animals
have
no
human
instincts
and
do
not
know
how
to
take
a
joke
we
are
apt
to
think
that
wild
animals
in
captivity
are
worrying
over
being
confined
in
cages
and
gazed
at
and
commented
on
by
curious
visitors
and
that
they
dream
of
the
free
life
they
lived
in
the
jungles
and
sigh
to
go
back
where
they
were
captured
and
prowl
around
for
food
but
you
ca
fool
me
animals
that
formerly
had
to
go
around
in
the
woods
hungry
half
the
time
and
occasionally
gorging
themselves
on
a
dead
animal
and
sleeping
out
in
the
rain
in
all
kinds
of
weather
know
when
they
have
struck
a
good
thing
in
a
menagerie
with
clean
straw
to
sleep
in
and
when
they
are
hungry
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
sound
their
bugle
and
they
have
beefsteak
and
breakfast
food
brought
to
them
on
a
silver
platter
and
if
the
food
is
not
to
their
liking
they
set
up
a
kick
like
a
star
boarder
at
a
boarding
house
their
condition
in
the
show
in
its
changed
condition
from
that
of
their
native
haunts
is
like
taking
a
hobo
off
the
trucks
of
a
freight
train
and
taking
him
to
the
dining
car
of
the
limited
and
letting
him
eat
to
a
finish
people
talk
about
animals
escaping
from
captivity
and
going
back
to
the
jungles
and
humane
societies
shed
tears
over
the
poor
captives
sighing
for
their
homes
but
you
turn
them
loose
at
south
bend
and
run
your
circus
train
to
new
albany
without
them
and
they
would
follow
the
train
and
overtake
it
before
the
evening
performance
the
next
day
and
you
would
find
them
trying
to
break
into
their
cages
again
and
they
would
have
to
be
fed
when
pa
and
i
went
into
the
barn
where
the
cages
were
to
take
an
account
of
stock
and
get
acquainted
with
our
animals
they
acted
just
like
the
circus
men
did
when
they
saw
pa
clothes
the
animals
were
about
half
asleep
when
we
went
in
but
a
big
lion
bent
one
eye
on
pa
and
then
he
rose
up
and
shook
himself
and
gave
a
roar
and
a
cough
that
sounded
like
he
had
the
worst
case
of
pneumonia
and
he
snorted
a
couple
of
times
as
though
he
was
saying
to
the
other
animals
something
that
will
kill
you
dead
and
i
want
you
all
to
have
a
piece
of
it
raw
and
he
brayed
some
more
and
all
the
animals
joined
in
the
chorus
the
big
tiger
lying
down
on
his
stomach
and
waving
his
tail
and
snarling
and
showing
his
teeth
like
a
cat
that
has
located
a
mouse
hole
and
the
tiger
seemed
to
say
o
i
saw
it
first
and
it
mine
the
hyena
set
up
a
laugh
like
a
man
who
is
not
tickled
but
feels
that
it
is
up
to
him
to
laugh
at
a
funny
story
that
he
ca
see
the
point
of
at
a
banquet
where
chauncey
depew
tells
one
of
his
crippled
jokes
and
pa
was
getting
nervous
a
big
grizzly
bear
was
walking
delegate
in
his
cage
and
he
looked
at
pa
as
much
as
to
say
hello
teddy
i
was
not
at
home
when
you
called
in
colorado
but
you
get
in
this
cage
and
i
will
make
you
think
the
spanish
war
was
a
sunday
school
picnic
beside
what
you
will
get
from
your
uncle
ephraim
and
a
bob
cat
jumped
up
into
the
top
of
his
cage
and
snarled
and
showed
his
teeth
and
seemed
to
say
bring
on
your
whole
pack
of
dogs
and
i
will
eat
them
alive
pa
threw
out
his
chest
in
front
of
a
monkey
cage
and
a
monkey
snatched
his
watch
and
then
all
the
animals
began
to
laugh
at
pa
just
like
a
lot
of
bad
boys
in
school
when
visitors
make
a
call
pa
went
around
to
visit
all
the
animals
officially
while
i
got
interested
in
a
female
kangaroo
with
a
couple
of
babies
not
more
than
three
weeks
old
and
i
noticed
the
mother
kangaroo
made
the
old
man
kangaroo
her
husband
stand
around
and
he
acted
just
like
some
men
i
have
seen
who
were
afraid
to
say
their
souls
were
their
own
in
the
presence
of
their
wives
the
female
kangaroo
is
surely
a
wonder
and
seems
to
be
built
on
plans
and
specifications
different
from
any
other
animal
cause
she
has
got
a
pouch
on
her
stomach
just
like
a
vest
that
she
carries
her
young
in
when
the
babies
are
frightened
they
make
a
move
towards
ma
the
pouch
opens
and
they
jump
in
out
of
sight
like
a
gopher
going
into
its
hole
and
the
mother
looks
around
as
innocent
as
can
be
as
much
as
to
say
you
can
search
me
i
do
know
honestly
where
those
kids
have
gone
but
they
were
around
here
not
more
than
a
minute
ago
and
when
the
fright
is
over
the
two
heads
peep
out
of
the
top
of
the
pouch
and
the
old
man
grunts
as
much
as
to
say
o
come
on
out
there
is
no
danger
and
let
your
ma
have
a
little
rest
she
is
nervous
and
then
the
babies
come
out
and
run
around
the
cage
and
sit
up
on
their
hind
feet
and
look
wise
that
kangaroo
pouch
is
a
success
and
i
wonder
why
nature
did
not
provide
pouches
for
all
animals
to
carry
their
young
in
i
think
pullman
must
have
got
his
ideas
for
the
upper
and
lower
berths
of
a
sleeping
car
by
seeing
a
kangaroo
pouch
i
am
going
to
study
the
kangaroo
and
make
friends
with
the
old
man
kangaroo
he
looks
as
though
he
had
troubles
of
his
own
pa
showed
up
without
any
coat
while
i
was
kangarooing
and
there
was
a
rip
in
his
pants
and
i
asked
him
what
was
the
trouble
and
he
said
he
got
too
near
the
cage
of
a
leopard
that
seemed
to
be
asleep
and
the
traitor
reached
out
his
paw
and
gathered
in
the
tail
of
pa
coat
and
just
snatched
it
off
his
back
as
though
it
was
made
of
paper
illustration
a
leopard
reached
out
his
paw
and
gathered
in
the
tail
of
pa
coat
pa
is
a
little
discouraged
about
his
experience
in
the
circus
the
first
day
but
he
says
it
will
be
great
when
we
get
the
run
of
the
business
he
says
every
day
will
have
its
excitement
tomorrow
they
are
going
to
extract
a
tooth
from
the
and
pa
and
i
are
going
to
help
hold
him
while
the
animal
dentist
pulls
the
tooth
and
then
we
scrub
the
rhinoceros
and
oil
the
hippopotamus
and
get
everything
ready
to
start
out
on
the
road
and
i
ca
write
any
more
in
my
diary
until
after
we
fix
the
snake
gee
but
he
is
as
long
as
a
clothesline
chapter
iii
pa
reproves
the
fat
woman
for
losing
flesh
the
bearded
lady
faints
in
pa
arms
the
bad
boy
introduced
into
animal
society
they
pull
the
boa
constrictor
ulcerated
tooth
winter
quarters
of
the
only
circus
april
pa
has
had
a
hard
job
today
the
boss
complained
to
pa
that
the
fat
woman
had
been
taking
or
dieting
or
something
she
was
losing
flesh
and
the
living
skeleton
was
beginning
to
fat
up
he
wanted
pa
to
call
them
into
the
office
and
have
a
diplomatic
talk
with
them
about
their
condition
if
this
thing
continued
they
would
ruin
the
show
so
pa
went
to
the
office
and
sent
for
them
and
i
was
there
as
a
witness
in
case
of
trouble
the
fat
woman
came
in
first
and
there
was
no
chair
big
enough
for
her
so
she
sat
down
on
a
leather
lounge
which
broke
and
let
her
down
on
the
floor
and
pa
tried
to
help
her
up
but
it
was
like
lifting
a
load
of
hay
so
he
leaned
her
against
the
wall
and
said
madame
the
management
has
detailed
me
to
censure
you
for
losing
flesh
and
i
am
instructed
to
say
if
you
do
not
manage
to
take
on
about
fifty
pounds
more
flesh
before
the
show
starts
on
the
road
you
do
go
along
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
eat
more
starchy
food
and
sleep
more
at
night
they
tell
me
you
go
out
nights
to
dances
and
drink
high
balls
and
this
has
got
to
stop
drink
beer
and
eat
cheese
sandwiches
at
night
or
it
is
all
off
this
show
ca
afford
to
take
along
no
fairy
for
a
fat
woman
when
the
contract
calls
for
a
mountain
of
flesh
see
and
pa
looked
just
as
stern
as
could
be
the
fat
woman
began
to
cry
and
sob
so
it
sounded
like
an
engine
blowing
off
steam
and
she
told
pa
that
the
cause
of
her
losing
flesh
was
that
she
was
in
love
with
the
living
skeleton
and
that
he
had
been
paying
attention
to
the
bearded
woman
and
she
would
scratch
her
eyes
out
if
she
could
catch
her
just
then
the
living
skeleton
came
in
and
when
he
saw
the
fat
woman
sitting
on
the
floor
crying
and
pa
talking
soothing
to
her
and
telling
her
he
could
appreciate
her
condition
he
had
been
in
love
some
hisself
the
skeleton
pushed
pa
away
and
tried
to
lift
it
and
said
what
is
the
matter
with
my
itty
and
what
has
the
bad
old
man
with
spinach
on
his
chin
been
doing
to
you
then
he
turned
on
pa
and
his
legs
began
to
shake
and
rattle
like
a
pair
of
bones
in
a
minstrel
show
and
he
said
i
will
hold
you
responsible
for
this
pa
said
he
was
not
going
to
interfere
in
the
love
affairs
of
any
of
the
freaks
and
just
then
the
bearded
woman
came
in
and
when
she
saw
the
living
skeleton
holding
the
hand
of
the
fat
woman
who
sat
on
the
floor
like
a
balloon
blowed
up
the
bearded
woman
gave
a
kick
at
the
living
skeleton
which
sounded
like
clothes
bars
falling
down
in
the
laundry
and
she
grabbed
the
fat
woman
blonde
wig
and
pulled
it
off
and
then
the
bearded
woman
began
to
cry
and
she
threw
herself
into
arms
and
began
to
sob
on
his
bosom
and
mingle
her
whiskers
with
his
illustration
i
will
hold
you
responsible
for
this
pa
yelled
for
help
and
i
thought
it
was
time
for
me
to
be
doing
something
so
i
went
outside
the
office
to
the
fire
alarm
box
and
touched
a
button
and
then
i
run
like
thunder
for
the
police
and
the
firemen
came
with
the
extinguishers
and
began
to
throw
chemically
charged
water
into
the
room
and
the
police
dragged
out
the
fat
woman
who
had
fainted
and
the
living
skeleton
whom
she
had
pulled
down
into
her
lap
and
laid
them
out
in
the
ring
and
then
they
got
hold
of
pa
and
pulled
him
out
and
the
bearded
woman
had
fainted
in
pa
arms
and
the
stove
was
tipped
over
and
was
setting
fire
to
the
furniture
and
they
brought
the
bearded
woman
and
the
fat
woman
to
their
senses
by
pouring
water
on
them
from
a
hose
finally
they
were
sent
to
their
quarters
and
the
other
owner
of
the
show
came
to
pa
and
said
he
hoped
this
would
be
the
last
of
that
kind
of
business
as
long
as
pa
remained
with
the
show
that
one
of
the
rules
was
that
no
man
in
an
executive
capacity
must
under
any
circumstances
take
any
liberties
with
any
of
the
females
connected
with
the
show
pa
was
hot
and
said
when
women
got
crazy
in
love
no
man
was
safe
and
the
other
owner
of
the
show
said
that
was
all
right
this
time
but
not
to
let
it
occur
again
and
pa
tried
to
explain
how
the
bearded
woman
came
to
jump
on
to
him
and
faint
in
his
arms
but
the
owner
said
that
is
all
right
but
you
ca
hold
in
your
arms
before
folks
and
then
pa
offered
to
whip
any
man
who
said
he
was
in
love
with
any
bearded
woman
and
he
pulled
off
his
coat
just
then
i
came
along
and
told
the
whole
story
and
then
the
crowd
all
had
a
good
laugh
and
pa
took
them
all
out
and
treated
i
guess
it
is
all
settled
now
the
living
skeleton
and
the
fat
woman
have
got
permission
to
get
married
the
bearded
lady
is
sweet
on
pa
and
a
girl
has
just
joined
the
show
who
walks
a
wire
and
she
says
i
am
about
the
sweetest
thing
that
ever
came
down
the
pike
and
i
guess
this
show
business
is
all
right
all
right
april
we
are
getting
acquainted
with
the
animals
and
it
is
just
like
going
into
society
there
is
the
aristocracy
which
consists
of
the
high
born
animals
the
middle
class
and
the
low
down
common
herd
and
when
you
go
among
the
animals
as
strangers
you
are
received
just
as
you
would
be
in
society
if
you
are
properly
introduced
to
the
elephants
by
the
elephant
keeper
who
vouches
for
your
standing
and
honor
the
elephants
take
to
you
all
right
and
extend
to
you
certain
courtesies
same
as
society
people
would
invite
you
to
dinner
but
if
you
wander
around
and
sort
of
butt
in
the
elephants
are
on
to
you
in
a
minute
and
roll
their
eyes
at
you
and
look
upon
you
as
a
common
person
and
if
you
attempt
any
familiarity
they
look
at
you
as
much
as
to
say
sir
i
am
not
allowed
to
associate
with
any
except
the
then
they
turn
their
backs
and
act
so
much
like
shoddy
aristocracy
that
you
would
swear
they
were
human
i
remember
when
pa
was
first
in
the
elephant
corral
the
keeper
forgot
to
tell
the
big
elephant
who
pa
was
and
when
the
keeper
raised
up
one
foot
of
the
elephant
and
examined
a
corn
pa
went
up
and
pinched
a
bunch
on
the
elephant
leg
and
said
to
the
keeper
that
looks
to
me
like
a
spavin
and
he
nebbed
it
hard
well
the
elephant
groaned
like
a
boy
with
a
stone
bruise
on
his
heel
and
before
pa
knew
what
was
coming
the
elephant
wound
his
trunk
under
pa
and
raised
pa
upon
his
tusks
and
was
going
to
toss
him
in
the
air
and
catch
him
as
he
came
down
and
walk
on
him
when
pa
yelled
murder
and
the
keeper
took
an
iron
hook
and
hooked
it
into
the
elephant
skin
and
said
let
that
man
down
and
he
let
pa
down
easy
and
the
keeper
some
way
showed
the
elephant
that
pa
was
one
of
the
owners
of
the
show
and
that
elephant
acted
just
as
human
as
could
be
for
he
fairly
toadied
to
pa
like
a
society
leader
that
has
given
the
cold
shoulder
to
some
one
that
is
as
good
or
better
than
they
or
like
an
impudent
employee
who
has
insulted
his
employer
and
is
afraid
of
losing
his
job
after
that
whenever
pa
and
i
go
around
the
elephants
they
bow
down
to
us
and
i
think
i
could
take
an
iron
hook
and
drive
an
elephant
anywhere
there
are
all
classes
among
the
animals
in
a
menagerie
the
same
as
human
society
the
lions
are
like
the
leaders
of
society
who
are
well
born
and
proud
but
poor
they
are
always
invited
everywhere
but
never
entertain
though
they
kick
and
find
fault
and
ogle
everybody
and
look
wise
and
distinguished
the
sacred
cattle
are
too
good
to
live
and
pose
as
the
pious
animals
who
do
not
want
to
associate
with
the
bad
animals
and
are
constantly
wearing
an
air
of
i
am
holier
than
any
of
you
but
they
will
reach
through
the
bars
of
their
cage
and
steal
alfalfa
from
the
yak
and
the
mule
deer
and
if
they
kick
about
it
the
sacred
cattle
look
hurt
and
act
like
it
was
part
of
their
duty
to
take
up
a
collection
and
they
bellow
a
sort
of
hymn
to
drown
the
kicking
the
different
kind
of
goats
in
a
menagerie
are
the
or
the
new
rich
who
get
in
the
way
of
the
society
leaders
and
try
to
outdo
them
in
society
stunts
but
they
smell
so
that
the
other
animals
are
made
sick
and
the
goats
are
only
tolerated
because
animal
society
is
afraid
to
offend
them
for
fear
the
leaders
may
some
time
go
into
bankruptcy
and
the
goats
will
take
their
places
and
never
let
them
get
a
smell
of
the
good
things
of
life
the
bears
are
the
working
people
of
the
show
and
the
big
grizzlies
are
the
walking
delegates
who
control
the
amalgamated
association
of
working
bears
and
the
occupants
of
the
other
cages
have
got
to
cater
to
uncle
ephraim
the
walking
delegate
or
be
placed
on
the
unfair
list
and
slugged
the
hyenas
and
the
jackals
and
the
wolves
represent
the
anarchists
who
are
down
on
everybody
in
the
show
who
wo
do
a
thing
to
help
along
and
wo
allow
any
other
animal
to
do
anything
and
who
seem
to
want
to
burn
and
slay
to
carry
a
torch
by
night
and
poison
by
day
and
want
everything
in
the
show
to
be
chaos
those
animals
are
never
so
happy
as
when
the
wind
and
lightning
strike
the
tent
and
blow
it
down
and
kill
people
and
create
a
panic
and
then
these
anarchists
sing
and
laugh
and
enjoy
their
peculiar
kind
of
animal
religion
the
zebras
and
giraffes
are
the
dudes
of
the
show
and
you
can
imagine
if
they
were
human
they
would
play
tennis
and
golf
drive
four
in
hands
and
pose
to
be
admired
while
the
royal
bengal
tigers
if
they
were
half
human
would
drive
automobiles
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
a
minute
on
crowded
streets
run
over
people
and
never
stop
to
help
the
wounded
but
skip
away
with
a
sneer
as
much
as
to
say
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
the
hippopotamus
is
like
the
lazy
fat
man
that
groans
from
force
of
habit
sits
down
as
though
it
was
the
last
act
of
his
life
and
only
gets
up
when
the
bell
rings
for
meals
and
he
sweats
blood
for
fear
he
will
lose
his
meal
ticket
and
starve
to
death
the
seals
are
the
baptists
of
the
show
who
believe
in
immersion
and
they
have
more
brain
than
any
animals
in
the
show
because
they
live
on
a
fish
diet
though
they
have
a
pneumonia
cough
that
makes
you
feel
like
sending
for
a
doctor
gee
but
last
night
when
we
thought
spring
had
come
and
we
could
start
on
the
road
pretty
soon
the
snow
fell
about
a
foot
deep
and
it
was
so
cold
that
all
the
animals
howled
all
night
and
shivered
and
went
on
a
regular
strike
we
had
to
put
blankets
on
them
and
no
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
comfortable
except
the
polar
bears
the
arctic
foxes
and
the
fat
woman
the
other
owners
of
the
show
thought
it
was
a
good
time
to
take
the
boa
constrictor
and
pull
an
ulcerated
tooth
he
was
sort
of
dumpish
so
pa
and
i
helped
hold
the
snake
which
is
about
twenty
feet
long
pa
was
up
near
the
snake
head
and
when
the
man
with
the
forceps
got
hold
of
the
tooth
and
gave
it
a
yank
the
confounded
snake
come
to
and
began
to
stand
on
his
head
and
thrash
around
and
pa
dropped
his
hold
and
started
to
climb
the
center
pole
but
he
got
caught
in
a
gasoline
torch
and
they
had
to
turn
a
hose
on
pa
and
he
was
awful
scared
he
always
did
hate
snakes
but
they
gave
the
snake
chloroform
and
got
him
quiet
and
pa
came
down
and
they
gave
him
a
pair
of
baggy
trousers
belonging
to
the
clown
to
go
to
dinner
in
and
pa
was
a
sight
illustration
they
had
to
turn
the
hose
on
chapter
iv
pa
finds
the
fat
lady
a
burden
the
bad
boy
makes
his
first
public
appearance
he
talks
politics
with
the
midget
pa
meets
with
numerous
accidents
may
we
had
the
darndest
time
getting
packed
up
and
started
on
the
road
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
we
ever
got
half
the
things
on
the
cars
is
more
than
i
know
but
it
seems
as
though
the
circus
company
had
a
man
to
look
after
everything
and
he
had
men
under
him
to
look
after
his
regular
share
of
things
so
when
the
cars
were
loaded
and
the
boss
clapped
his
hands
and
the
engineer
tooted
his
whistle
there
was
a
tent
stake
or
a
rope
or
a
board
seat
or
anything
left
behind
every
man
knew
exactly
where
the
things
were
that
he
was
responsible
for
so
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
them
in
the
dark
and
he
knew
just
what
wagon
his
stuff
was
to
go
in
gee
but
you
talk
about
system
there
is
no
business
in
the
world
that
has
a
system
like
a
show
on
the
road
every
performer
was
in
his
or
her
section
in
the
sleeper
and
pa
and
i
got
an
end
section
with
the
freaks
the
fat
woman
across
the
aisle
from
us
that
fat
woman
is
going
to
make
life
a
burden
for
pa
i
can
see
that
plain
enough
she
is
engaged
to
the
living
skeleton
and
he
sleeps
in
the
upper
berth
over
her
and
he
is
jealous
of
pa
while
the
fat
woman
has
got
to
depending
on
pa
to
do
little
things
for
her
of
course
the
first
night
out
is
always
the
worst
on
a
sleeper
and
the
poor
woman
is
nervous
and
when
the
animal
train
in
the
second
section
ran
on
a
side
track
beside
our
train
of
sleepers
and
rajah
the
boss
lion
got
woke
up
and
exploded
one
of
his
roars
within
six
feet
of
the
fat
woman
berth
she
just
gave
one
yell
and
reared
up
and
came
down
hard
in
the
berth
something
broke
and
she
went
right
through
the
bottom
of
the
berth
to
the
floor
doubled
up
like
a
jackknife
pa
got
up
and
went
to
her
berth
though
i
told
him
to
keep
away
he
would
get
into
trouble
first
he
stumbled
over
one
of
her
shoes
and
said
he
thought
he
had
told
everybody
to
keep
their
telescope
valises
in
the
baggage
car
and
that
made
her
mad
then
he
reached
in
the
berth
and
got
hold
of
one
of
her
feet
and
pa
got
the
men
to
help
and
they
got
her
out
but
she
seemed
all
squshed
together
she
sat
up
all
night
and
wanted
to
lean
on
pa
but
the
skeleton
kept
his
head
over
the
rail
of
the
upper
berth
and
his
eye
never
left
pa
all
night
the
bearded
woman
got
up
out
of
her
berth
about
daylight
to
go
to
the
toilet
room
for
a
shave
or
a
hair
cut
or
something
and
when
she
saw
pa
trying
to
soothe
the
fat
woman
and
hold
her
from
breaking
in
two
she
screamed
and
slapped
pa
face
and
had
a
mess
of
hysterics
the
fat
woman
grabbed
a
couple
of
handfuls
of
female
whiskers
and
was
going
to
pull
them
out
by
the
roots
when
the
bearded
woman
begged
her
not
to
pull
them
out
as
to
lose
her
whiskers
would
destroy
her
means
of
livelihood
then
the
bugle
blew
for
everybody
to
get
up
and
go
to
the
show
lot
and
put
up
the
tents
for
the
first
show
of
the
season
when
we
got
out
of
the
sleeper
we
asked
where
we
were
and
a
man
told
pa
we
were
at
peoria
and
he
wanted
pa
to
give
him
a
complimentary
ticket
for
telling
what
town
we
were
in
but
pa
looked
fierce
at
the
man
and
asked
what
kind
of
an
easy
mark
he
took
him
for
and
the
man
slunk
away
you
would
think
they
could
unload
those
two
trains
of
cars
about
in
all
in
a
week
but
when
we
got
out
the
horses
were
hitched
on
the
wagons
and
in
minutes
they
were
loaded
and
on
the
way
to
the
lot
and
pa
and
i
got
on
the
first
wagon
talk
about
system
the
surveyors
were
there
ahead
of
us
and
had
measured
off
the
lot
and
pushed
wire
stakes
in
the
ground
where
the
grub
tent
was
to
be
and
when
the
first
wagon
of
the
grub
outfit
arrived
which
contained
a
big
range
big
enough
to
cook
for
a
thousand
men
stove
pipes
were
put
on
which
telescoped
up
into
the
air
and
in
two
minutes
a
fire
was
built
and
bacon
and
potatoes
and
coffee
were
cooking
local
bread
wagons
were
unloading
bread
on
the
grass
men
put
up
poles
and
spread
the
tent
on
and
others
set
up
tables
in
the
tent
and
in
half
an
hour
breakfast
was
served
to
the
first
men
pa
and
i
drew
up
to
the
first
table
but
there
was
a
yell
to
put
out
and
we
found
we
had
sat
down
to
the
table
of
the
negro
canvasmen
and
they
struck
because
they
would
not
associate
on
an
equality
with
white
trash
gee
but
pa
was
mad
he
said
he
was
as
good
as
any
nigger
and
that
made
them
mad
and
they
threw
boiled
potatoes
and
scrambled
eggs
at
pa
and
we
had
to
retire
but
when
pa
complained
to
the
boss
canvasman
he
told
pa
to
go
and
eat
with
the
freaks
and
try
and
keep
in
his
place
illustration
they
threw
boiled
potatoes
and
scrambled
eggs
at
we
got
breakfast
at
another
table
and
then
we
went
out
on
the
lot
to
superintend
the
putting
up
of
the
big
tents
the
greatest
thing
was
a
wagon
containing
a
miniature
pile
driver
run
by
steam
which
was
driven
around
outside
of
where
the
big
tents
were
to
be
and
it
drove
down
the
big
stakes
so
quick
it
would
make
your
head
swim
and
the
grounds
were
covered
with
peoria
people
who
wanted
to
see
how
it
was
done
pa
imitated
the
boss
canvasman
by
walking
around
the
lot
with
his
coat
over
his
arm
and
a
dirty
shirt
on
trying
to
look
tough
and
he
bossed
the
sightseers
about
and
acted
cross
and
told
a
man
and
woman
with
a
baby
wagon
to
get
off
the
lot
but
pa
was
called
down
by
the
principal
owner
of
the
show
good
and
plenty
said
the
owner
to
pa
remember
the
success
of
our
show
depends
on
the
friendship
and
good
will
of
the
people
who
think
enough
of
us
to
come
out
to
see
us
set
up
keeping
house
and
that
they
are
all
our
guests
and
if
they
get
in
our
way
we
should
go
around
them
and
look
pleasant
we
must
not
get
the
big
head
and
show
that
our
hair
pulls
and
that
we
are
tired
and
cross
this
is
a
place
of
amusement
and
all
connected
with
the
show
are
expected
to
heal
up
sores
instead
of
causing
bruises
and
if
you
ever
see
an
employee
of
this
show
treating
a
visitor
unkindly
send
him
to
the
ticket
wagon
to
get
his
wages
and
tell
him
to
go
away
quick
and
stay
away
long
you
could
have
lit
a
match
to
pa
face
it
was
so
red
hot
but
he
learned
a
lesson
for
i
saw
him
holding
a
tired
mother
baby
up
on
his
shoulders
so
it
could
see
the
drove
of
camels
come
up
to
the
lot
from
the
train
soon
after
it
was
great
to
see
all
the
tents
go
up
as
if
raised
by
machinery
and
after
all
were
erected
and
the
rings
were
graded
and
the
animals
in
the
menagerie
tent
all
fed
and
watered
and
the
performers
in
the
ready
for
the
afternoon
performance
pa
was
the
proudest
man
ever
was
he
walked
all
around
inspecting
everything
and
kicking
occasionally
at
something
that
got
balled
up
and
when
the
crowd
came
to
buy
tickets
he
stood
around
the
grand
entrance
looking
wise
and
he
was
so
good
natured
that
he
bet
ten
dollars
he
could
guess
which
walnut
shell
a
bean
was
under
which
a
monte
man
was
losing
money
at
and
pa
lost
his
ten
with
a
smile
he
said
he
wanted
to
be
kind
to
the
patrons
of
the
show
this
was
my
first
appearance
in
the
show
business
i
had
to
stand
up
beside
the
giant
to
show
how
little
i
was
and
then
i
had
to
stand
up
beside
the
midget
to
show
how
big
i
was
compared
with
him
it
went
all
right
with
the
giant
because
he
was
so
big
i
was
afraid
of
him
but
i
thought
the
midget
was
about
my
age
and
needed
protection
and
when
the
crowd
surged
around
us
i
said
do
be
afraid
little
fellow
i
will
see
that
no
one
harms
you
the
look
he
gave
me
was
enough
to
freeze
water
when
the
crowd
had
gone
into
the
big
show
tent
what
do
you
think
that
confounded
midget
began
to
ask
me
how
i
stood
on
the
tariff
question
and
he
argued
for
free
trade
whatever
that
is
for
half
an
hour
and
made
me
think
of
bryan
during
a
campaign
and
then
he
branched
off
on
to
the
monroe
doctrine
which
i
suppose
is
something
connected
with
a
rival
show
and
i
guess
he
would
be
talking
yet
only
a
big
husky
fellow
came
along
a
fellow
about
years
old
and
he
stooped
over
and
put
his
hand
on
the
midget
shoulder
and
said
hello
dad
and
by
gosh
the
midget
introduced
me
to
the
big
galoot
as
his
youngest
son
would
that
skin
you
the
first
day
of
the
season
was
great
only
all
the
performers
had
not
got
limbered
up
one
of
the
girls
on
the
flying
trapeze
fell
off
into
the
net
from
the
roof
of
the
tent
and
broke
her
suspenders
so
when
they
got
her
down
in
the
ring
it
seemed
as
though
everything
she
had
on
was
going
to
shuck
loose
and
leave
her
with
nothing
but
a
string
of
beads
and
pa
went
up
to
wrap
his
coat
around
her
and
she
kicked
his
hat
off
and
ran
into
the
the
audience
just
yelled
and
pa
blushed
scarlet
he
saw
it
was
a
job
to
make
him
ridiculous
illustration
she
kicked
pa
hat
off
during
the
chariot
races
pa
had
to
jump
like
a
box
car
to
keep
from
being
run
over
by
a
chariot
driven
by
a
girl
and
the
attendants
dragged
pa
out
from
under
a
bunch
of
horses
being
ridden
barebacked
like
fury
then
two
horses
hitched
together
with
a
strap
were
being
ridden
by
a
woman
the
strap
broke
and
the
horses
spread
apart
and
some
one
yelled
that
she
had
split
clear
in
two
pa
rushed
in
to
help
carry
one
half
of
her
into
the
but
she
hurt
at
all
the
peanut
boy
told
me
she
was
a
rubber
woman
and
you
could
stretch
her
half
way
across
the
ring
and
she
would
come
together
all
right
and
eat
a
hearty
meal
gee
but
a
circus
is
a
great
place
to
study
human
nature
in
the
evening
performance
at
peoria
there
came
up
a
windstorm
which
blew
down
part
of
the
menagerie
tent
where
the
freaks
were
and
when
the
storm
was
over
and
the
tent
top
was
pulled
up
again
they
found
pa
all
right
he
started
to
crawl
under
the
canvas
and
skip
out
for
fear
of
the
animals
but
the
fat
lady
caught
him
and
sat
down
on
him
with
the
circus
chapter
the
rogue
elephant
creates
a
panic
and
pa
proves
himself
a
hero
the
bad
boy
gets
scolded
for
being
tough
he
finds
that
audiences
like
accidents
may
we
had
the
worst
time
at
akron
last
week
and
pa
proved
himself
a
hero
though
he
was
swatted
good
by
the
rogue
elephant
before
he
got
his
second
wind
and
went
for
the
animal
we
have
a
male
elephant
that
is
almost
human
he
gets
on
a
tear
about
once
a
month
like
a
regular
ugly
husband
you
ca
tell
when
his
mind
is
in
condition
for
running
amuck
but
suddenly
he
will
whoop
like
a
drunken
man
strike
his
poor
patient
wife
over
the
back
with
his
trunk
and
grab
her
tail
and
try
to
pull
it
out
by
the
roots
and
jump
up
and
crack
his
heels
together
like
a
drunken
shoemaker
and
bellow
as
though
he
was
saying
he
was
a
bad
man
from
bitter
creek
well
at
akron
the
keeper
of
this
elephant
bolivar
had
to
go
and
see
a
girl
that
he
met
when
the
show
was
here
last
year
and
settle
a
case
of
breach
of
promise
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
the
boss
told
pa
to
look
after
the
elephant
for
an
hour
or
so
so
pa
took
a
pole
with
a
hook
in
it
and
sat
down
on
a
bale
of
hay
to
watch
bolivar
it
was
one
of
those
hot
days
and
bolivar
stood
drooping
and
perspiring
and
wishing
the
show
was
in
alaska
and
pa
was
kind
of
sleepy
like
everybody
in
the
show
when
suddenly
that
elephant
whooped
and
swatted
jeanette
his
wife
a
couple
of
times
and
she
cried
pitiful
and
pa
put
the
hook
in
bolivar
hide
and
gave
a
jerk
and
told
him
to
hush
up
that
noise
but
bolivar
just
reared
and
pitched
and
walked
right
through
the
side
of
the
menagerie
tent
and
seemed
to
say
to
the
other
animals
come
on
boys
there
is
going
to
be
something
doing
and
the
animals
all
set
up
a
howl
in
their
own
language
as
though
they
were
saying
whooper
up
old
man
and
do
let
them
monkey
with
you
bolivar
went
out
in
the
street
and
mowed
a
wide
swath
with
pa
after
him
hooking
him
all
the
time
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
pa
he
put
his
head
under
the
side
of
a
street
ear
loaded
with
negroes
that
had
come
to
see
the
show
dressed
in
their
sunday
clothes
and
tipped
the
car
over
on
the
side
and
the
negroes
crawled
through
the
windows
and
went
uptown
yelling
murder
while
bolivar
went
in
front
of
a
grocery
store
where
there
was
a
pile
of
watermelons
and
began
to
throw
them
at
the
people
in
the
street
and
the
negroes
thought
an
elephant
was
not
so
bad
so
they
came
back
and
had
a
feast
pa
tried
to
head
off
bolivar
at
the
grocery
but
bolivar
took
half
a
watermelon
and
put
the
red
side
on
top
of
pa
head
and
squashed
it
down
so
the
seeds
and
juice
and
pulp
ran
down
pa
shirt
and
neck
and
he
looked
as
though
murder
had
been
committed
but
pa
wiped
his
face
on
his
shirt
sleeve
and
showed
game
because
he
kept
mauling
bolivar
with
the
hook
bolivar
broke
up
a
millinery
store
by
throwing
tomatoes
at
the
women
in
the
windows
and
he
went
into
a
yard
where
a
woman
was
washing
and
squirted
the
bluing
water
all
over
the
woman
and
all
over
pa
and
then
he
chewed
the
clothes
on
the
line
and
drove
the
family
over
the
fence
illustration
bolivar
took
half
a
watermelon
and
put
the
red
side
on
top
of
pa
head
you
a
died
to
see
those
milliners
climb
over
a
high
board
fence
head
first
and
bolivar
actually
seemed
to
laugh
bolivar
run
one
of
his
tusks
through
a
barrel
of
gasoline
and
it
run
out
on
the
street
car
track
and
an
electric
spark
set
it
on
fire
and
the
fire
department
turned
out
but
the
engines
had
to
all
go
around
bolivar
he
would
budge
an
inch
but
seemed
to
say
let
rip
boys
this
is
the
fourth
of
july
the
circus
men
began
to
come
with
ropes
and
clubs
to
tie
bolivar
and
throw
him
but
he
escaped
into
a
side
street
and
watched
the
engines
put
out
the
fire
and
he
swung
around
with
his
trunk
and
tusks
and
let
anyone
come
near
him
but
pa
with
the
hook
and
he
seemed
to
enjoy
the
prodding
but
i
guess
that
gave
him
courage
to
keep
on
doing
things
the
principal
proprietor
of
the
show
came
along
and
when
he
saw
pa
with
watermelon
and
bluing
water
all
over
him
and
perspiration
rolling
down
his
face
he
said
to
pa
why
do
you
take
your
elephant
back
to
the
lot
the
afternoon
performance
is
about
to
begin
and
that
made
pa
mad
and
he
said
you
go
on
with
your
afternoon
performance
and
i
will
have
bolivar
there
all
right
and
then
everybody
laughed
but
pa
knew
what
he
was
about
pa
dropped
his
hook
and
went
to
a
hose
cart
and
took
a
babcock
extinguisher
and
strapped
it
on
his
back
and
went
up
to
bolivar
who
was
tipping
over
some
dummies
in
front
of
a
clothing
store
and
pa
said
bolivar
you
lay
down
but
bolivar
threw
a
suit
of
clothes
at
pa
and
bellowed
as
much
as
to
defy
pa
turned
the
cock
of
the
extinguisher
and
pointed
the
nozzle
at
bolivar
head
and
began
to
squirt
the
medicated
water
all
over
him
for
a
moment
bolivar
acted
as
though
he
could
take
a
joke
and
was
going
to
start
off
again
but
pa
kept
squirting
and
when
the
chemical
water
began
to
eat
into
bolivar
hide
the
big
animal
weakened
and
trumpeted
in
token
of
surrender
and
kneeled
down
in
front
of
pa
and
finally
got
down
so
pa
could
get
on
his
back
and
pa
took
the
hook
and
hooked
it
in
the
flap
of
bolivar
ear
where
is
a
tender
spot
and
he
told
bolivar
to
get
up
and
go
back
to
the
tent
and
bolivar
was
as
meek
as
a
lamb
and
he
got
up
with
pa
on
his
back
and
the
fire
extinguisher
on
pa
back
and
marched
back
to
the
tent
through
the
hole
he
had
made
coming
out
thousands
of
people
followed
and
cheered
pa
and
when
they
got
in
the
tent
pa
said
to
the
principal
owner
of
the
show
who
had
made
fun
of
him
your
elephant
and
whenever
any
of
your
old
animals
get
on
the
warpath
and
you
want
rounded
up
do
forget
my
number
i
can
knock
the
spots
out
of
any
animal
except
a
giraffe
the
crowd
cheered
pa
again
and
he
got
down
off
the
elephant
took
off
his
fire
extinguisher
and
handed
bolivar
a
piece
of
rag
carpet
and
said
eat
it
you
old
catamaran
or
i
kill
you
and
bolivar
was
so
scared
of
pa
he
eat
the
carpet
which
shows
the
power
of
brain
over
avoirdupois
pa
says
illustration
pa
turned
the
cock
of
the
extinguisher
and
pointed
the
nozzle
at
bolivar
head
the
regular
keeper
of
bolivar
heard
he
was
on
the
rampage
and
he
came
back
on
the
run
to
conquer
him
after
pa
had
got
him
back
in
the
tent
but
bolivar
looked
at
him
with
a
faraway
look
in
his
eyes
as
much
as
to
say
seems
to
me
i
have
met
you
somewhere
before
but
a
new
king
has
been
crowned
and
he
took
his
old
keeper
by
the
back
of
his
coat
and
threw
him
toward
the
monkey
cage
the
monkeys
gave
the
keeper
the
laugh
and
bolivar
put
his
trunk
lovingly
on
pa
shoulder
and
seemed
to
say
old
man
you
are
it
from
this
time
out
pa
looked
proud
and
the
old
keeper
looked
sick
the
people
in
the
show
are
going
to
present
pa
with
a
loving
cup
and
i
guess
he
can
run
the
menagerie
part
of
the
show
when
the
freaks
heard
of
pa
bravery
the
fat
woman
and
the
bearded
lady
wanted
to
hug
pa
but
pa
waved
them
away
and
said
he
liked
the
elephant
business
best
may
i
used
to
think
that
if
i
could
belong
to
a
circus
and
go
away
with
it
when
it
left
the
town
i
lived
in
that
it
would
be
pretty
near
going
to
heaven
i
used
to
hope
for
the
time
when
i
would
get
nerve
enough
to
run
away
and
go
with
a
circus
and
wear
a
dirty
shirt
and
be
around
a
tent
and
wash
off
the
legs
of
a
spotted
horse
with
castile
soap
and
when
people
gathered
about
me
to
watch
the
proceedings
to
look
tough
and
tell
them
in
a
hoarse
voice
way
down
my
throat
sort
of
husky
from
sleeping
in
the
wet
straw
with
the
spotted
horse
that
they
must
go
on
about
their
business
and
not
disturb
the
horse
i
had
thought
if
i
should
run
away
and
go
with
a
circus
some
day
when
i
got
far
enough
away
from
ma
that
i
would
up
and
swear
and
be
tough
and
when
i
came
home
in
the
fall
and
the
neighbor
boys
would
come
around
me
i
would
chew
tobacco
and
tell
them
of
the
joys
of
circus
life
well
maybe
i
will
some
day
but
at
present
i
am
sleepy
all
the
time
we
have
showed
six
times
the
last
week
and
traveled
a
thousand
miles
and
it
seems
as
though
there
is
nothing
doing
but
putting
up
and
taking
down
tents
and
going
to
and
from
the
cars
and
you
ca
be
tough
there
is
always
some
boss
around
to
tell
you
to
look
pleasant
if
you
are
cross
and
to
tell
you
to
change
your
shirt
or
get
out
of
the
show
and
if
you
swear
at
anything
you
are
called
down
pa
and
i
put
in
a
good
deal
of
time
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
performances
in
the
near
the
door
leading
to
the
main
tent
that
is
the
nearest
to
being
in
an
insane
asylum
of
any
place
i
was
ever
in
the
performers
get
ready
for
their
several
acts
in
bunches
or
families
all
in
one
spot
and
they
act
serious
and
jaw
each
other
and
each
bunch
acts
as
though
their
act
was
all
there
was
to
the
show
and
if
it
was
cut
out
for
any
reason
the
show
would
have
to
lay
up
for
the
season
when
in
fact
each
one
is
only
a
cog
in
the
great
wheel
and
if
one
cog
should
slip
the
wheel
would
turn
just
the
same
these
people
never
smile
before
they
go
in
the
ring
but
just
act
as
though
too
much
depended
on
them
to
crack
a
smile
when
a
bunch
is
called
to
go
in
the
ring
they
all
look
at
each
other
as
though
it
was
the
parting
of
the
ways
and
they
clasp
hands
and
go
out
of
the
as
though
walking
on
eggs
when
they
get
in
the
ring
they
look
around
to
see
if
all
eyes
are
upon
them
and
bow
to
people
who
are
looking
at
something
going
on
in
another
ring
and
who
do
see
them
and
then
they
go
through
their
performance
with
everybody
looking
somewhere
else
when
the
act
is
over
the
audience
seems
glad
and
clap
their
hands
because
they
are
polite
and
it
do
cost
anything
to
clap
hands
and
the
performers
turn
some
more
flip
flaps
and
go
running
out
to
the
and
take
a
peek
back
into
the
big
tent
as
though
expecting
an
encore
but
the
audience
has
forgotten
them
and
is
looking
for
the
next
mess
of
performers
and
the
ones
who
have
just
been
in
go
and
lie
down
on
straw
and
wonder
if
they
can
hit
the
treasurer
for
an
advance
on
their
salaries
so
they
can
go
to
a
beer
garden
and
forget
it
all
an
average
audience
never
gets
its
money
worth
unless
some
one
is
hurt
doing
some
daring
act
pa
suggested
that
they
have
some
one
pretend
to
be
hurt
in
every
act
and
have
them
picked
up
and
carried
out
on
stretchers
with
doctors
wearing
red
crosses
on
their
arms
in
attendance
giving
medicine
and
restoratives
the
show
tried
it
at
bucyrus
and
had
seven
men
and
two
women
injured
so
they
had
to
be
carried
out
and
the
audience
went
wild
and
almost
mobbed
the
to
see
the
doctor
operate
on
the
injured
it
was
such
a
great
success
that
next
week
we
are
going
to
put
in
an
automobile
ambulance
and
have
an
operating
table
in
the
with
a
gauze
screen
so
the
audiences
can
see
us
cut
off
legs
like
they
do
in
a
hospital
maybe
we
shall
put
in
a
dissecting
room
if
the
people
seem
to
demand
it
chapter
vi
the
bad
boy
puts
in
the
bob
cat
cage
the
bob
cat
causes
a
panic
in
the
main
tent
the
midget
quarrels
with
the
giant
pa
is
almost
arrested
for
kidnaping
and
the
ostrich
swallows
his
diamond
stud
may
this
has
been
a
week
that
would
kill
anybody
and
pa
and
i
talk
of
resigning
though
pa
feels
as
though
he
did
want
to
break
up
the
show
by
going
away
right
in
the
middle
of
the
harvesting
of
shekels
from
the
country
men
and
i
do
know
what
would
happen
if
pa
and
i
should
both
be
taken
sick
at
the
same
time
the
boss
of
the
menagerie
got
a
new
animal
by
express
from
colorado
when
we
were
leaving
akron
and
we
got
it
in
one
end
of
a
cage
occupied
by
a
happy
family
of
rabbits
coons
a
spotted
leopard
and
a
hound
dog
and
a
house
cat
the
new
animal
was
a
bob
cat
such
as
roosevelt
shoots
when
the
man
has
the
camera
ready
to
catch
him
in
the
act
say
but
that
bob
cat
is
a
terror
and
crosser
than
any
animal
we
got
except
the
hyenas
the
bob
cat
just
walked
around
and
snarled
and
spit
at
the
happy
family
through
the
bars
and
kept
them
awake
all
night
on
the
road
and
the
happy
family
held
a
sort
of
convention
and
i
could
see
by
the
way
they
all
looked
at
me
that
they
were
passing
resolutions
inviting
me
to
break
up
the
bob
cat
business
the
manager
of
the
menagerie
told
pa
he
wished
the
confounded
bob
cat
would
escape
he
was
a
blooming
nuisance
so
i
thought
i
would
help
get
rid
of
the
beast
and
save
the
show
from
disgrace
so
when
we
got
to
oberlin
i
thought
that
was
a
pious
community
that
could
stand
a
wild
bob
cat
so
i
put
several
sheets
of
sticky
tanglefoot
fly
paper
in
the
bob
cat
cage
and
opened
the
door
of
the
cage
after
the
crowd
had
gone
into
the
main
tent
to
the
big
show
and
the
menagerie
tent
was
empty
except
the
keepers
they
were
all
asleep
under
the
wagons
and
the
animals
had
all
curled
down
for
a
nap
and
the
freaks
were
on
their
platform
lolling
around
waiting
for
the
main
show
to
be
out
so
they
could
do
their
stunts
over
again
the
bob
cat
got
all
his
four
feet
in
the
tanglefoot
fly
paper
then
he
grabbed
a
sheet
in
his
mouth
and
rolled
over
in
a
few
more
sheets
and
when
he
was
entirely
harmless
and
you
could
tell
what
he
was
i
opened
the
door
of
the
cage
and
he
went
out
like
a
rocket
and
rolled
over
a
few
times
in
the
sawdust
and
then
jumped
on
the
platform
with
the
freaks
run
over
the
fat
woman
who
was
laying
back
in
a
morris
chair
and
left
one
of
the
sheets
of
fly
paper
on
her
low
neck
and
it
stuck
like
a
porous
plaster
she
yelled
that
she
had
been
stabbed
and
pa
came
along
just
as
the
bob
cat
jumped
off
the
platform
and
struck
pa
on
the
back
and
the
cat
spit
at
pa
and
pa
fell
over
among
the
sacred
cattle
and
rolled
under
a
cow
and
got
on
his
knees
when
the
animals
all
began
to
roar
and
pa
crawled
behind
a
bale
of
hay
and
a
zebra
stepped
on
pa
face
and
pa
yelled
hey
rube
which
is
a
grand
hailing
sign
of
distress
when
circus
men
want
to
fight
and
about
a
hundred
of
the
canvasmen
came
running
with
tent
stakes
to
hit
people
with
illustration
the
bob
cat
struck
pa
on
the
back
pa
crawled
out
from
the
bale
of
hay
which
he
had
pulled
over
him
and
the
hay
stuck
to
the
fly
paper
on
pa
and
a
camel
began
to
eat
the
hay
and
he
chewed
pa
shirt
until
the
hands
pulled
pa
away
the
bob
cat
escaped
into
the
main
tent
just
as
the
japanese
jugglers
were
juggling
in
no
ring
and
the
elephants
were
standing
on
their
heads
in
no
ring
and
the
flying
trapeze
artists
were
jumping
from
one
trapeze
to
another
and
the
bob
cat
rushed
through
the
japanese
and
amongst
the
elephants
with
the
fly
paper
all
over
him
and
the
audience
fairly
yelled
they
thought
it
was
a
clown
dressed
up
to
do
some
stunt
but
the
japanese
left
the
ring
in
a
panic
while
the
elephants
got
down
off
their
heads
and
stood
on
their
hind
feet
and
cried
like
children
the
audience
saw
that
something
had
happened
that
was
serious
and
they
all
rose
to
their
feet
and
were
going
off
into
a
panic
when
pa
and
a
few
brave
men
came
and
drove
the
bob
cat
up
a
centerpole
away
up
above
the
torches
and
made
speeches
to
the
audience
and
quieted
them
down
and
the
performance
went
on
but
pa
was
a
sight
and
the
head
circus
man
told
pa
he
would
have
to
dress
better
or
forever
after
hold
his
peace
and
pa
said
if
any
man
could
be
more
patient
than
he
was
with
a
bob
cat
on
his
neck
a
sacred
cow
walking
on
him
and
a
camel
trying
to
eat
his
whiskers
and
shirt
they
better
hire
that
man
but
it
was
all
fixed
up
and
everybody
apologized
to
everybody
and
the
bob
cat
went
on
up
the
center
pole
and
out
on
top
of
the
canvas
and
escaped
into
ohio
where
it
will
probably
be
holding
office
before
next
fall
gee
but
the
giant
is
a
coward
when
the
bob
cat
began
to
run
up
the
giant
leg
and
then
up
his
back
and
then
jumped
from
his
shoulder
onto
the
fat
lady
the
giant
turned
pale
and
cried
and
the
midget
said
to
him
o
you
big
stiff
why
did
you
have
sand
enough
to
hold
the
kitty
till
the
keeper
came
i
a
good
mind
to
get
on
a
stepladder
and
kick
you
and
the
cowardly
giant
cried
again
and
said
if
the
midget
ever
struck
him
he
would
report
him
to
the
management
just
then
pa
came
along
and
asked
what
the
row
was
about
and
when
pa
found
that
the
midget
was
trying
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
giant
he
took
the
midget
across
his
knee
and
gave
him
a
few
spanks
and
told
him
to
quit
bullying
the
freaks
the
midget
got
up
on
a
barrel
and
called
his
son
who
is
bigger
than
pa
when
i
stepped
in
between
them
and
told
the
midget
son
if
he
struck
my
father
i
would
have
his
heart
blood
and
he
quailed
and
then
i
bullied
the
giant
who
is
a
coward
and
now
they
are
all
afraid
of
me
i
do
see
how
a
big
fellow
like
a
giant
can
be
afraid
of
things
smaller
than
he
is
and
shy
when
a
dog
barks
and
be
afraid
some
one
is
going
to
smash
him
in
the
jaw
but
pa
says
the
size
of
a
man
do
make
any
difference
it
is
the
heart
that
does
the
business
a
man
may
be
big
enough
and
strong
enough
to
tip
over
a
box
car
loaded
with
pig
iron
but
if
his
heart
is
one
of
these
little
ones
intended
for
a
miser
with
no
pepper
sauce
running
from
the
heart
to
the
arteries
and
things
and
a
liver
that
is
white
and
nerves
that
are
trembly
and
no
gall
to
speak
of
why
a
big
man
is
liable
to
be
walked
all
over
by
a
nervy
little
man
who
is
spunky
and
gets
mad
and
froths
at
the
mouth
i
have
been
having
great
times
with
the
monkeys
and
i
guess
the
manager
will
make
me
superintendent
of
monkeys
they
all
seem
to
be
stuck
on
me
and
will
do
anything
i
tell
them
to
pa
says
they
think
i
am
some
new
kind
of
a
monkey
and
they
look
up
to
me
i
lead
out
the
big
monkeys
that
ride
the
goats
and
dogs
and
have
a
horse
race
in
the
ring
and
fasten
them
on
the
little
animals
and
when
they
ride
around
the
ring
on
the
dogs
and
goats
and
ponies
they
keep
looking
at
me
as
though
they
wanted
my
approval
there
is
one
little
monkey
that
sleeps
nearly
all
the
time
and
i
played
a
trick
on
pa
with
it
that
like
to
got
me
arrested
and
licked
by
a
man
who
was
mad
a
man
and
woman
with
a
baby
in
a
little
wagon
were
going
through
the
menagerie
and
it
was
crowded
and
they
left
the
baby
and
wagon
in
pa
charge
near
the
monkey
cage
while
they
went
to
see
the
hippopotamus
pa
is
the
most
accommodating
man
about
holding
babies
that
ever
was
the
baby
was
asleep
when
its
folks
left
it
in
the
wagon
with
pa
but
it
woke
up
while
they
were
gone
and
pa
took
it
out
of
the
baby
wagon
and
carried
it
around
just
as
he
would
at
home
and
showed
it
the
animals
and
held
it
up
on
his
shoulder
and
i
took
the
little
monkey
and
put
it
in
the
baby
wagon
and
it
went
to
sleep
and
i
put
a
veil
over
it
and
was
standing
by
the
wagon
talking
with
a
peanut
butcher
when
the
parents
of
the
baby
came
back
and
the
woman
raised
up
the
veil
to
see
if
the
child
was
asleep
when
the
monkey
woke
up
and
put
its
hairy
hands
up
to
rub
it
eyes
the
monkey
looked
up
at
the
woman
with
beady
eyes
and
began
to
chatter
and
she
yelled
and
her
husband
took
a
look
at
the
monk
and
he
was
mad
they
could
both
see
it
was
a
monkey
instead
of
a
baby
and
they
asked
where
the
old
man
with
the
chin
whiskers
was
that
they
left
the
baby
with
and
the
peanut
butcher
said
what
that
old
guy
with
the
checkered
vest
why
he
has
gone
with
the
baby
over
to
the
lion
cage
where
they
are
feeding
the
lions
do
you
see
him
holding
the
baby
upon
his
shoulder
by
ginger
i
never
saw
two
people
sprint
the
way
they
did
i
guess
they
thought
pa
was
sure
crazy
and
would
give
the
baby
to
the
lions
but
i
told
them
the
old
man
was
all
right
and
would
bring
the
baby
back
and
if
he
did
they
could
have
the
monkey
i
did
want
them
to
think
they
were
going
to
be
losers
while
attending
our
show
then
i
chucked
the
monkey
under
the
chin
and
said
maybe
this
is
your
baby
they
change
wonderfully
when
they
get
into
a
show
well
i
just
had
time
to
put
the
monkey
back
in
the
cage
when
i
saw
that
couple
surround
pa
and
the
woman
grabbed
the
baby
out
of
his
arms
and
the
man
tackled
pa
around
the
legs
below
the
knee
and
threw
pa
down
under
the
ostrich
cage
and
said
you
kidnaper
i
am
a
good
mind
to
choke
the
life
out
of
you
and
he
squeezed
pa
windpipe
until
tongue
run
out
when
a
canvasman
came
along
and
hit
the
man
in
the
ear
and
he
laid
down
near
a
zebra
and
the
zebra
kicked
at
the
man
and
hit
pa
a
zebra
is
crosseyed
and
kicks
like
a
woman
throws
a
stone
and
no
man
knows
where
it
listeth
illustration
the
man
tackled
pa
got
up
to
murder
the
man
that
choked
him
when
the
ostrich
reached
its
head
out
between
the
bars
of
the
cage
and
picked
pa
big
diamond
stud
off
his
shirt
big
as
a
piece
of
rock
candy
and
swallowed
it
and
pa
said
that
the
limit
and
he
called
the
manager
and
asked
him
how
he
was
going
to
get
his
diamond
stud
out
of
the
ostrich
the
manager
told
pa
to
go
to
the
and
ask
the
woman
who
has
charge
of
the
wardrobe
for
the
ostrich
stomach
pump
and
when
he
got
the
stomach
pump
the
manager
said
the
ostrich
would
cough
up
the
diamond
stud
pa
went
off
to
the
to
get
the
ostrich
stomach
pump
and
i
knew
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
i
thought
the
manager
was
just
stringing
well
he
went
up
to
the
woman
in
the
and
said
he
came
after
her
stomach
pump
ostrich
size
and
you
a
died
to
see
the
ruction
the
woman
looked
at
pa
as
though
he
had
escaped
from
a
sanitarium
and
then
she
seemed
to
think
he
was
trying
to
make
game
of
her
and
she
said
you
old
skate
do
you
know
who
you
have
the
honor
of
addressing
i
am
the
queen
of
this
realm
and
they
all
to
me
now
you
come
and
take
your
medicine
and
before
pa
could
say
boo
she
had
pulled
a
big
clothes
bag
over
his
head
and
tied
it
around
his
feet
and
said
come
on
girls
we
are
going
to
have
roasted
missionary
and
they
were
lighting
a
gasoline
torch
to
roast
pa
when
the
owner
of
the
show
came
along
and
asked
what
was
up
when
the
wardrobe
woman
told
him
pa
had
insulted
her
the
owner
gave
her
to
buy
champagne
for
the
performers
and
she
released
pa
and
he
went
back
to
choke
his
diamond
out
of
the
ostrich
pa
says
this
life
is
more
exciting
if
anything
than
staying
at
home
and
it
will
either
kill
him
or
cure
him
of
a
desire
to
be
a
barnum

takes
a

and
attends
a

meeting
well
we
have
had
a
row
for
your
life
and
all
the
excitement
anybody
can
stand
we
got
into
indiana
and
have
had
a
yellow
fever
scare
a
quarantine
that
lasted
one
night
so
nobody
could
sleep
on
our
train
a
riot
at
evansville
we
took
on
a
couple
of
female
trapeze
women
that
came
from
honduras
via
new
orleans
and
a
revival
of
religion
all
in
one
bunch
and
pa
is
beginning
to
get
haggard
like
a
hag
the
female
trapeze
performers
who
had
been
expected
ever
since
we
started
on
the
road
had
been
quarantined
at
new
orleans
where
the
yellow
fever
is
raging
and
finally
got
through
the
quarantine
guard
somewhere
in
mississippi
and
got
to
us
saturday
afternoon
and
some
official
telegraphed
to
the
mayor
that
two
yellow
fever
refugees
had
struck
his
town
to
join
the
circus
and
he
ordered
the
chief
of
police
to
hunt
them
out
and
put
them
in
a
pest
house
the
honduras
females
were
yellow
as
saffron
but
it
was
caused
by
the
climate
of
honduras
but
the
whole
show
was
scared
to
death
for
fear
we
would
all
have
yellow
fever
and
the
management
detailed
pa
and
i
to
hide
the
yellow
girls
from
the
police
pa
fixed
up
one
of
the
cages
with
the
girls
blacked
up
as
hottentots
and
pa
and
i
blacked
up
as
an
african
king
and
prince
of
the
blood
and
we
did
stunts
in
the
cage
at
afternoon
and
evening
performances
and
the
crowd
could
not
keep
away
from
our
cage
until
pa
got
hot
and
unbuttoned
his
shirt
and
before
we
knew
it
everybody
saw
pa
white
skin
below
where
his
face
and
neck
were
blacked
and
while
we
were
talking
gibberish
to
each
other
a
country
jake
got
mad
and
he
led
a
crowd
to
open
the
cage
and
make
us
remove
our
shirts
to
prove
that
we
were
hottentots
when
they
found
we
were
white
people
blacked
up
they
wanted
their
money
back
and
were
going
to
tip
over
the
cage
when
pa
saved
the
day
by
making
a
speech
at
the
evening
performance
to
the
effect
that
we
were
all
yellow
fever
refugees
from
new
orleans
and
the
mob
lit
out
on
the
run
for
the
main
tent
where
they
announced
that
there
were
four
cases
of
fever
in
the
menagerie
tent
and
that
settled
it
the
mayor
and
police
closed
the
show
on
account
of
yellow
fever
and
we
could
get
out
of
the
tent
pa
had
been
quite
close
to
the
yellow
girls
and
when
he
found
out
that
yellow
fever
was
a
disease
that
catches
you
when
not
looking
and
in
minutes
you
look
like
a
corpse
and
in
four
hours
you
are
liable
to
be
a
sure
enough
corpse
he
shook
the
yellow
girls
and
asked
an
old
sailor
what
a
man
ought
to
do
who
has
been
exposed
to
yellow
fever
and
the
old
sailor
who
has
had
yellow
fever
lots
of
times
told
pa
to
strip
off
his
clothes
and
take
a
bath
of
prepared
mustard
and
rub
it
in
thoroughly
and
then
wipe
it
off
and
take
a
vinegar
rub
and
after
that
sprinkle
a
little
red
pepper
on
himself
put
on
different
clothes
and
drink
about
a
gallon
of
red
lemonade
and
he
could
defy
yellow
fever
pa
is
an
easy
mark
and
he
believed
the
old
sailor
who
is
tattooed
and
makes
a
show
of
himself
with
the
freaks
and
pa
took
a
change
of
clothes
and
a
bottle
of
mustard
and
a
cruet
of
vinegar
and
a
bottle
of
red
pepper
and
went
into
a
dressing
room
and
got
behind
a
wagon
and
began
to
take
the
cure
the
sailor
had
prescribed
i
do
know
as
it
was
right
to
do
it
but
about
the
time
pa
had
got
to
the
red
pepper
course
and
was
sprinkling
it
on
his
skin
pretty
thick
and
he
was
beginning
to
get
pretty
hot
and
was
yelling
a
little
i
told
the
chief
of
police
who
was
looking
around
with
the
health
officer
for
suspicious
cases
that
there
was
a
man
acting
sort
of
queer
behind
the
wagon
that
had
a
piece
of
canvas
over
the
wheels
they
both
rushed
in
on
pa
and
grabbed
him
gee
but
pa
looked
and
smelled
like
a
plate
of
pigs
feet
and
the
doctor
said
it
was
an
unmistakable
case
of
yellow
fever
he
could
tell
by
the
smell
and
then
pa
turned
pale
and
yellow
from
fright
and
they
wrapped
him
up
in
a
piece
of
canvas
and
took
him
away
in
an
emergency
hospital
ambulance
and
the
whole
show
at
once
knew
that
we
were
in
for
a
quarantine
illustration
the
doctor
said
it
was
an
unmistakable
case
of
yellow
fever
they
burned
up
the
suit
of
clothes
pa
took
off
and
the
one
he
was
going
to
put
on
and
the
ambulance
drove
away
while
pa
shook
one
fist
at
the
sailor
and
one
at
me
and
his
skin
began
to
shrink
and
smart
and
he
yelled
and
the
audience
stampeded
and
the
show
was
in
the
dumps
we
had
to
stay
over
sunday
in
evansville
and
the
show
people
were
so
scared
the
manager
thought
he
better
have
religious
services
in
the
tent
sunday
so
they
got
a
revivalist
preacher
to
preach
to
them
a
fellow
who
used
to
preach
to
the
cowboys
out
west
sunday
morning
the
tough
fellows
in
the
show
said
they
would
do
a
thing
to
the
preacher
when
he
came
on
to
do
his
stunt
their
idea
was
to
wait
until
he
got
well
on
his
sermon
and
then
begin
to
interrupt
him
and
ask
questions
and
finally
to
get
a
blanket
and
toss
him
up
a
few
times
for
luck
and
then
chase
him
out
and
have
the
circus
bulldog
that
chews
the
clown
pants
catch
the
minister
coat
tail
and
just
scare
him
plum
to
death
the
boys
said
it
would
be
the
biggest
picnic
that
ever
was
a
regular
barbecue
the
boss
canvasman
said
he
was
opposed
to
mixing
religion
with
the
circus
business
because
the
fellows
could
get
all
the
religion
they
needed
in
the
winter
when
the
show
was
laid
up
and
he
would
see
the
boys
through
in
anything
they
proposed
to
do
to
the
sky
pilot
that
was
going
to
play
his
game
in
ring
no
at
the
next
day
well
after
i
heard
the
circus
men
talk
about
what
they
would
do
to
the
preacher
i
was
afraid
they
would
kill
him
so
when
he
and
a
helper
brought
a
little
melodeon
into
the
ring
facing
the
reserved
seats
i
told
him
the
boys
were
going
to
raise
a
rumpus
and
drive
him
out
of
the
tent
with
the
bulldog
hanging
to
his
coat
tails
he
put
his
hand
on
his
pistol
pocket
and
pulled
a
long
blue
gun
about
half
way
out
and
let
it
drop
back
down
beside
his
leg
and
he
winked
at
me
and
said
he
guessed
not
scarcely
as
he
had
preached
to
crowds
so
tough
that
a
circus
gang
was
a
sunday
school
in
comparison
then
i
got
on
a
front
seat
to
watch
the
fun
about
of
the
circus
hands
performers
clowns
and
peanut
butchers
came
in
snickering
and
sat
down
on
the
reserved
seats
in
front
of
the
little
pulpit
improvised
from
the
barrels
the
elephants
stand
on
and
some
of
them
laughed
and
said
hello
bill
and
ah
there
and
get
on
to
his
collar
and
a
lot
of
other
things
the
little
husky
preacher
had
a
salvation
army
girl
to
play
the
melodeon
and
he
did
take
any
notice
of
the
remarks
the
boys
made
except
to
set
his
jaws
together
and
moisten
his
lips
finally
they
were
all
seated
and
he
got
up
to
open
the
services
when
a
big
canvasman
a
regular
smart
aleck
got
up
on
a
seat
and
said
pardner
how
you
going
to
open
this
jack
pot
the
crowd
laughed
and
the
preacher
pulled
his
long
blue
gun
up
out
of
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
barrel
and
then
picked
it
up
and
pointed
it
at
the
big
canvasman
and
said
this
game
is
going
to
be
opened
with
this
hand
seven
of
a
kind
all
caliber
bullets
and
unless
you
sit
down
quick
i
will
send
a
mess
of
bullets
into
your
carcass
right
where
your
heart
ought
to
be
if
you
open
your
mouth
again
before
i
say
real
loud
at
the
close
of
the
services
i
will
shoot
all
your
front
teeth
out
do
you
comprehend
if
so
be
seated
the
big
fellow
dropped
on
to
the
blue
seat
as
though
he
had
been
hit
with
a
piledriver
and
the
crowd
was
so
tickled
to
have
the
bluff
called
that
they
cheered
the
preacher
then
he
said
we
will
now
open
this
jack
pot
with
singing
and
i
shall
keep
one
eye
on
the
gentleman
who
was
last
up
but
who
is
now
seated
pretty
low
down
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
the
preacher
wiped
his
face
calmly
and
said
we
will
now
sing
and
i
expect
every
man
will
sing
and
to
that
end
i
will
appoint
big
ike
who
asked
me
how
i
was
going
to
open
this
jack
pot
to
come
down
in
front
of
the
seats
and
lead
in
the
singing
for
i
know
by
his
voice
which
i
heard
in
debate
that
he
is
a
crackerjack
and
the
preacher
took
hold
of
the
handle
of
the
blue
gun
and
big
ike
walked
down
through
the
rows
of
seats
and
as
the
melodeon
began
to
squawk
ike
got
down
in
front
of
the
audience
and
some
of
the
boys
said
bully
for
you
ike
and
after
scratching
his
head
a
minute
ike
turned
and
walked
towards
the
preacher
at
the
edge
of
the
ring
and
i
thought
there
was
going
to
be
the
worst
fight
ever
was
and
as
the
preacher
reached
for
the
gun
i
crawled
under
the
seat
and
peeked
out
between
the
legs
of
a
fat
man
but
ike
walked
up
to
the
minister
and
said
as
the
melodeon
began
to
cough
boys
this
tune
is
on
ike
he
started
it
and
every
man
sang
illustration
after
scratching
his
head
a
minute
ike
turned
and
walked
toward
the
preacher
when
it
was
ended
the
boys
clapped
and
stamped
for
an
encore
and
they
sang
it
through
again
and
the
face
of
the
preacher
beamed
with
joy
and
i
saw
there
was
not
going
to
be
any
fight
and
i
crawled
out
from
under
the
seats
pa
came
in
the
tent
just
then
with
a
new
suit
of
clothes
on
having
been
discharged
from
the
hospital
as
cured
of
yellow
fever
and
i
gave
him
my
seat
and
he
held
me
in
his
lap
the
preacher
then
preached
a
sermon
that
did
them
all
good
he
dwelt
upon
the
hard
life
of
the
showman
and
gave
them
such
good
advice
that
when
it
was
all
over
and
he
said
he
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
every
man
in
the
bunch
ike
marshaled
them
all
up
to
the
ring
and
introduced
them
and
no
minister
ever
was
more
cordially
congratulated
and
they
wanted
him
to
go
along
with
the
show
and
preach
every
sunday
the
preacher
said
he
could
join
the
show
but
he
traveled
around
a
good
deal
and
he
would
probably
be
in
the
same
town
with
the
show
several
times
during
the
summer
and
he
would
drop
in
on
them
occasionally
and
keep
them
straight
pa
was
watching
the
crowd
for
the
sailor
who
prescribed
cayenne
pepper
for
yellow
fever
and
when
he
saw
the
sailor
come
up
to
the
minister
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
say
parson
i
has
been
a
bad
man
and
killed
a
man
once
but
he
was
a
portuguese
sailor
and
he
had
the
drop
on
me
the
same
as
you
did
on
big
ike
at
the
opening
of
these
proceedings
and
i
had
to
kill
him
and
i
begs
the
pardon
of
this
old
gentleman
for
lying
to
him
and
then
pa
shook
hands
with
the
sailor
and
the
parson
and
the
parson
put
his
blue
gun
down
his
trousers
leg
and
said
by
the
way
the
bulldog
you
were
going
to
let
take
a
lunch
off
me
is
he
all
right
then
the
parson
and
the
girl
went
away
and
the
boys
carried
out
the
melodeon
and
the
quarantine
was
declared
off
after
dinner
the
boys
took
down
the
tents
and
put
them
on
the
train
that
sunday
afternoon
singing
decent
songs
as
they
pulled
up
the
stakes
and
rolled
up
the
canvas
and
on
the
train
late
in
the
night
we
could
hear
old
hundred
being
sung
as
the
cars
ran
through
the
pennyrial
district
of
indiana
chapter
viii
pa
takes
the
place
of
the
fat
woman
with
disastrous
results
a
kentucky
colonel
causes
a
row
pa
tries
to
roar
like
a
lion
and
the
rhinoceros
objects
pa
plays
the
and
gets
the
worst
of
it
this
has
been
an
eventful
week
with
the
show
we
have
had
heat
prostrations
in
kentucky
nearly
the
whole
show
got
drunk
on
whisky
and
if
it
had
been
for
the
animals
keeping
sober
this
show
would
have
been
pulled
for
disorderly
conduct
nobody
knows
how
the
row
started
but
pa
says
every
man
in
kentucky
carries
a
blue
gun
and
a
bottle
of
red
licker
and
they
wear
white
hats
so
the
red
white
and
blue
business
is
all
right
only
it
is
a
combination
that
is
death
on
a
circus
i
think
one
of
the
ushers
at
the
afternoon
performance
told
an
old
colonel
that
he
must
move
along
quicker
when
the
colonel
began
to
talk
back
and
say
who
is
you
talkin
too
sah
and
the
usher
stood
it
as
long
as
he
could
when
he
took
the
colonel
by
the
collar
and
sat
him
down
so
quick
he
did
come
to
for
a
couple
of
minutes
and
when
the
colonel
got
his
senses
and
found
that
the
usher
had
ushered
him
into
a
seat
between
two
gaily
decorated
colored
women
the
trouble
began
the
colonel
never
forgot
that
he
was
a
gentleman
for
he
rose
up
took
off
his
hat
to
the
colored
women
and
said
you
must
excuse
me
ladies
but
i
shall
have
to
go
and
kill
the
scoundrel
who
sat
me
down
with
niggers
and
he
got
down
off
the
seats
and
struck
the
usher
with
his
cane
and
the
usher
yelled
hey
rube
and
all
the
circus
people
made
a
rush
for
the
colonel
the
colonel
said
men
of
kentucky
to
the
rescue
and
before
i
could
crawl
under
the
seats
the
air
was
full
of
baggage
seats
tent
pins
and
white
hats
guns
were
fired
and
blood
flowed
and
the
police
pulled
everybody
and
the
evening
performance
was
given
up
one
of
the
proprietors
of
the
show
got
a
wen
on
his
head
as
big
as
a
football
from
being
struck
by
a
handle
of
a
revolver
and
the
colonel
who
started
the
row
was
knocked
silly
by
a
tray
of
red
lemonade
which
the
butcher
smashed
him
with
and
the
colonel
cried
because
the
lemonade
was
all
water
and
he
was
afraid
it
would
soak
into
him
and
cause
him
to
warp
when
the
lemonade
butcher
apologized
and
the
usher
told
him
it
was
all
a
mistake
his
being
seated
with
the
niggers
the
colonel
wept
on
their
necks
and
invited
the
whole
crowd
to
go
to
his
distillery
and
help
themselves
when
we
got
to
the
next
town
every
man
in
the
show
had
a
grouch
and
a
katzenjammer
and
their
hair
was
so
sore
it
was
murder
and
suicide
combined
to
comb
it
the
way
pa
escaped
injury
was
he
had
to
take
the
place
of
the
fat
woman
on
the
platform
with
the
freaks
as
the
fat
woman
was
overcome
with
the
heat
and
had
to
stay
in
the
car
the
way
they
fixed
pa
up
to
resemble
the
fat
woman
was
scandalous
they
have
some
rubber
things
in
the
wardrobe
tent
that
you
can
blow
up
and
make
a
big
arm
and
a
big
leg
and
a
big
stummick
so
anybody
tell
the
difference
and
they
fixed
pa
up
with
blowed
up
clothes
of
flesh
colored
rubber
and
but
for
his
chin
whiskers
you
could
tell
him
from
the
fat
woman
he
said
he
would
cut
off
his
whiskers
for
anybody
circus
so
they
fixed
a
veil
to
cover
part
of
his
face
and
put
the
fat
woman
dress
on
pa
and
put
him
up
beside
the
skeleton
the
midget
and
the
giant
pa
said
he
did
want
to
do
it
it
seemed
too
much
like
fraud
but
they
told
him
the
fate
of
the
show
depended
on
our
all
being
willing
to
take
any
part
assigned
to
us
and
so
pa
sat
down
and
began
to
fan
himself
and
tried
to
look
flirty
like
a
woman
the
other
freaks
never
noticed
but
what
it
was
the
fat
woman
until
the
show
was
half
over
it
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
just
laffed
at
pa
i
got
up
behind
him
and
told
him
in
a
whisper
that
i
wanted
a
dollar
to
play
the
slot
machine
and
he
told
me
to
go
to
thunder
and
get
out
of
there
i
could
stand
it
to
be
insulted
by
my
own
father
so
i
took
a
hat
pin
out
of
the
hat
of
the
bearded
lady
and
punched
it
into
blowed
up
rubber
shirt
and
pa
began
to
sis
like
a
soda
fountain
and
the
wind
struck
the
living
skeleton
and
blew
him
over
like
a
cyclone
and
by
that
time
pa
was
blowing
off
wind
in
a
dozen
places
that
i
had
punctured
and
he
was
scared
for
fear
there
would
be
anything
left
of
him
and
the
giant
saw
the
fat
woman
slowly
fading
away
and
the
coward
had
heart
failure
and
lay
down
on
the
platform
somebody
shouted
that
the
fat
woman
was
all
melting
away
and
a
fellow
who
was
watering
a
camel
out
of
a
bucket
came
to
the
rescue
and
threw
the
bucket
of
dirty
water
all
over
pa
and
then
i
thought
i
better
go
away
into
the
tent
and
see
the
fight
but
pa
was
taken
to
the
dressing
room
and
rescued
from
the
shrinking
rubber
balloons
that
were
busted
and
he
said
he
would
hunt
the
man
that
punctured
his
tire
to
his
dying
day
but
he
know
it
was
me
illustration
i
punctured
pa
tires
gee
it
looks
to
me
as
though
pa
has
been
engaged
to
act
as
the
easy
mark
in
this
show
say
they
got
pa
to
practice
on
roaring
like
a
lion
so
he
could
stand
behind
the
cage
when
the
lion
has
a
sore
throat
and
roar
and
scare
folks
and
pa
has
been
going
around
behind
the
cages
every
evening
when
the
menagerie
is
closed
and
the
crowd
in
the
main
tent
making
noises
that
have
made
the
animals
look
at
each
other
as
much
as
to
say
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
the
rhinoceros
was
so
disgusted
at
paducah
that
he
reached
out
his
nose
and
took
pa
on
his
horn
and
held
him
up
to
the
scorn
of
the
other
animals
until
pa
pants
gave
way
and
he
was
a
sight
and
he
was
so
scared
that
he
got
out
of
the
tent
and
made
a
run
for
our
train
chased
by
the
police
who
thought
he
was
a
burglar
that
had
been
eat
by
a
house
dog
illustration
chased
by
police
the
worst
thing
we
have
had
on
pa
was
at
louisville
where
we
stayed
over
sunday
another
fellow
and
i
got
a
system
on
slot
machines
and
one
day
we
beat
the
machines
out
of
a
shotbag
full
of
nickels
and
when
we
showed
up
at
the
tent
all
the
fellows
wanted
to
know
how
we
did
it
and
pa
said
it
was
gambling
and
we
ought
not
to
do
it
but
he
also
wanted
to
know
how
we
managed
to
win
and
when
we
told
pa
about
it
pa
said
it
was
no
sin
to
beat
a
slot
machine
it
was
an
inanimate
thing
just
a
machine
and
anybody
who
could
beat
a
nickel
in
the
slot
machine
at
his
own
game
was
equal
to
a
rockefeller
so
after
everybody
had
got
excited
about
our
nickels
i
told
them
how
to
beat
the
machine
i
told
them
i
did
get
excited
and
go
rushing
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
and
feed
the
slot
machine
on
good
hard
earned
nickels
of
my
own
but
waited
until
the
countrymen
and
tenderfeet
had
fed
it
on
nickels
until
it
was
too
full
for
utterance
when
the
machine
swelled
out
like
it
was
blowed
up
and
it
kind
of
wheezed
like
it
was
ready
to
cough
up
and
was
only
waiting
for
an
excuse
i
put
a
cough
lozenger
about
the
size
of
a
nickel
in
the
slot
and
turned
the
diaphram
the
machine
shuddered
a
minute
and
then
had
a
regular
hemorrhage
and
coughed
up
a
tin
cupful
of
nickels
into
my
hand
and
the
machine
seemed
to
rest
easy
and
take
nourishment
again
from
the
silly
fellows
who
thought
they
could
beat
it
well
sir
the
whole
crowd
was
so
excited
they
could
hardly
wait
to
find
a
slot
machine
and
finally
they
bought
nearly
all
my
cough
lozengers
and
went
out
into
the
night
and
pa
and
i
went
along
pa
said
he
understood
all
the
slot
machines
were
owned
by
rockefeller
and
he
made
more
money
on
them
than
he
did
on
standard
oil
and
the
money
that
he
gave
away
to
schools
and
churches
was
from
his
on
his
slot
machines
pa
said
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
someone
could
break
up
the
reprehensible
practice
by
beating
the
blasted
machines
to
a
finish
so
pa
he
got
a
bag
to
bring
back
the
nickels
in
and
a
bunch
of
us
went
to
a
store
where
one
whole
side
of
the
place
was
filled
with
slot
machines
and
the
way
the
people
were
playing
the
game
was
scandalous
pa
watched
a
machine
until
the
players
had
fed
it
so
it
seemed
as
though
it
would
die
unless
it
got
air
and
he
stepped
up
and
put
in
a
lozenger
and
turned
the
wheel
and
held
the
bag
under
the
spout
for
the
coin
but
it
did
come
some
more
fellows
put
in
nickels
and
the
machine
gave
little
hacking
coughs
and
coughed
up
three
or
four
nickels
but
nothing
that
seemed
at
all
in
the
nature
of
a
financial
hemorrhage
when
pa
took
another
lozenger
and
put
it
in
and
by
ginger
the
machine
began
to
heave
up
nickels
like
it
was
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
pa
was
so
excited
he
forgot
to
hold
the
bag
and
nickels
went
all
over
the
floor
and
everybody
made
a
grab
for
them
and
pa
was
shoved
aside
and
he
swore
he
would
have
the
place
pulled
and
just
then
a
law
officer
took
pa
in
charge
because
he
had
put
a
cough
lozenger
in
the
slot
machine
and
he
searched
pa
and
found
a
lot
more
bronchial
trochees
and
pa
was
in
for
it
on
a
charge
of
malpractice
for
giving
cough
medicine
for

they
took
pa
in
a
back
room
and
searched
him
some
more
and
found
his
roll
and
then
a
man
who
said
he
was
a
lawyer
offered
to
help
pa
and
keep
him
out
of
the
penitentiary
he
told
pa
the
law
of
kentucky
made
the
crime
of
trifling
with
a
slot
machine
the
same
as
breach
of
promise
or
arson
and
that
he
would
be
lucky
if
he
got
off
with
ten
years
in
the
pen
with
days
solitary
confinement
in
a
turkish
bath
cell
with
niggers
for
companions
pa
turned
blue
and
asked
the
lawyer
if
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
and
the
lawyer
told
him
that
for
in
spot
cash
he
would
let
him
go
and
fight
the
case
after
the
show
had
got
out
of
the
state
a
hundred
and
dollars
was
the
amount
they
found
on
pa
and
he
told
them
that
inasmuch
as
they
already
had
it
they
better
keep
the
money
and
let
him
go
and
he
would
be
always
a
living
example
of
the
terrors
of
gambling
so
they
let
pa
go
and
all
the
way
to
the
train
he
told
us
he
hoped
this
experience
would
be
a
lesson
to
us
not
to
covet
the
money
of
the
rich
and
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
john
rockefeller
could
go
plum
to
thunder
with
his
money
after
this
then
we
got
to
the
car
and
found
about
a
dozens
of
the
circus
men
who
had
been
out
to
beat
the
slot
machines
broke
flat
and
i
had
to
divide
my
shot
bag
of
nickels
with
them
that
i
had
won
before
i
let
them
into
the
game
before
they
would
let
me
go
to
bed

pa
makes
the
acquaintance
of
john
sullivan
i
am
learning
more
about
animals
every
day
and
when
the
season
is
over
i
will
be
an
expert
animal
man
animals
naturally
have
a
language
of
their
own
and
lions
understand
each
other
and
bears
can
converse
with
bears
but
in
a
show
all
animals
seem
to
have
a
common
language
so
they
understand
each
other
a
little
i
found
that
out
when
i
put
a
paper
of
cayenne
pepper
into
a
head
of
lettuce
and
gave
it
to
the
sacred
cow
she
chewed
the
lettuce
as
peacefully
as
could
be
and
swallowed
the
cayenne
pepper
and
then
stopped
to
think
you
could
tell
by
the
expression
on
her
face
that
when
the
pepper
began
to
heat
her
up
inside
she
wanted
to
swear
although
she
was
a
sacred
cow
she
humped
herself
and
shivered
and
then
bellowed
like
a
calf
who
has
been
left
in
the
barn
to
be
weaned
while
its
mother
goes
out
to
pasture
and
the
sacred
bull
her
husband
he
came
and
put
his
nose
up
to
her
nose
as
much
as
to
say
what
is
the
matter
dearie
and
she
talked
sacred
cattle
talk
to
him
for
a
minute
and
then
the
bull
turned
to
me
and
chased
me
out
of
the
tent
now
as
sure
as
you
live
that
cow
told
the
bull
that
i
had
given
her
something
hot
all
the
animals
within
hearing
were
onto
me
and
they
would
snarl
and
make
noises
when
i
came
along
and
act
as
though
they
wanted
to
make
me
understand
that
they
knew
i
gave
that
cow
a
hot
box
and
they
all
wanted
to
get
a
chance
at
me
they
do
like
pa
any
better
than
they
do
me
and
the
big
elephant
seems
to
have
been
laying
for
pa
ever
since
he
run
the
sharp
iron
into
him
the
time
he
got
on
a
tear
and
tried
to
run
a
town
when
the
elephants
are
performing
in
the
ring
they
all
have
an
eye
on
pa
so
everybody
notices
it
i
knew
something
would
happen
to
pa
so
when
the
man
who
plays
the
sheik
and
rides
the
elephant
in
the
street
parade
in
a
howdah
with
a
canopy
over
it
with
some
female
houris
in
it
and
they
called
for
a
volunteer
to
do
the
sheik
act
at
steubenville
and
pa
offered
to
do
the
stunt
i
went
along
as
an
egyptian
girl
i
knew
there
would
be
something
doing
the
elephant
eyed
pa
when
he
got
up
into
the
bungalow
on
top
of
him
with
the
circassian
woman
and
me
and
winked
at
the
other
elephants
as
much
as
to
say
watch
my
smoke
as
he
went
out
from
the
lot
on
the
way
downtown
ahead
of
the
bunch
all
the
other
animals
acted
peculiar
and
seemed
to
say
he
will
get
his
before
we
get
through
this
parade
the
big
elephant
is
one
of
the
best
ring
performers
but
he
has
always
been
steady
in
the
street
parade
with
the
light
of
asia
on
his
back
we
got
to
the
edge
of
town
and
stopped
to
let
the
rear
wagons
close
up
and
were
in
front
of
a
saloon
where
the
bartender
had
been
emptying
stale
beer
out
of
the
bottoms
of
kegs
into
a
washtub
which
was
standing
on
the
sidewalk
ready
to
be
sold
to
people
who
buy
it
in
pails
well
sir
that
confounded
elephant
got
his
trunk
in
that
tub
of
stale
beer
and
he
never
took
it
out
till
the
beer
was
all
gone
i
looked
down
from
the
pagoda
and
told
pa
the
elephant
was
drinking
again
and
had
drank
a
washtub
of
beer
but
pa
could
say
anything
he
was
doing
the
arab
sheik
act
and
had
to
look
dignified
as
though
he
was
praying
to
allah
but
just
then
the
band
struck
up
and
we
started
down
the
main
street
of
steubenville
the
people
began
to
cheer
our
elephant
began
to
and
waltz
sideways
across
the
street
and
back
again
and
i
thought
pa
would
die
in
the
parade
one
man
on
a
horse
attends
to
the
elephants
so
the
sheiks
do
have
anything
to
say
and
pa
remained
like
a
statue
and
told
me
and
the
circassian
beauties
to
be
calm
and
trust
in
him
and
allah
this
allah
business
was
all
right
when
the
elephant
waltzed
but
when
we
got
to
the
next
block
the
beast
began
to
stand
on
his
hind
feet
and
pa
and
the
houris
rolled
to
the
back
end
of
the
howdah
and
were
all
piled
in
a
heap
while
i
held
on
to
the
cloth
of
gold
over
the
elephant
head
pa
yelled
to
the
people
on
horseback
to
kill
the
elephant
and
the
crowd
cheered
thinking
it
was
the
best
performance
they
ever
saw
in
a
free
street
parade
and
the
animals
in
the
cages
behind
were
yapping
as
though
they
knew
what
was
going
on
the
elephant
got
down
on
all
fours
and
we
straightened
up
in
the
pagoda
and
for
a
block
or
so
the
beast
only
waltzed
around
as
we
got
to
some
sort
of
a
public
square
where
there
were
thousands
of
people
the
stale
beer
seemed
to
be
getting
in
its
work
for
the
elephant
looked
at
the
people
as
much
as
to
say
now
i
will
show
you
something
not
down
on
the
bills
and
by
ginger
if
he
did
raise
up
his
hind
quarters
and
stand
on
his
front
feet
right
by
the
side
of
a
big
fountain
and
he
reached
in
his
trunk
for
a
drink
when
all
of
us
on
the
pagoda
clung
to
pa
and
we
all
slid
right
off
into
the
big
basin
of
water
the
fountain
played
on
us
and
pa
was
under
water
with
the
four
circassian
beauties
and
when
we
rolled
or
slid
down
over
the
elephant
head
he
looked
at
us
and
seemed
to
chuckle
what
you
getting
off
here
for
the
show
ai
half
out
well
the
parade
went
on
and
left
the
elephant
and
the
rest
of
us
at
the
fountain
and
to
show
that
animals
understand
each
other
and
can
appreciate
a
joke
every
animal
that
passed
us
gave
us
the
laugh
even
the
hippopotamus
which
opened
his
mouth
as
big
as
a
tunnel
and
showed
his
teeth
and
acted
as
though
he
would
like
to
exchange
tanks
with
us
the
circus
people
that
could
be
spared
from
the
wagons
came
to
help
us
and
the
citizens
helped
out
the
circassian
beauties
who
were
praying
to
allah
and
wringing
out
their
clothes
and
i
crawled
up
on
the
neck
of
a
swan
in
the
fountain
pa
yelled
and
talked
profane
and
told
to
bring
a
cannon
and
kill
the
elephant
which
kept
ducking
him
with
his
trunk
and
swabbing
out
the
bottom
of
the
fountain
basin
with
pa
it
seemed
as
though
he
never
would
get
through
using
pa
for
a
mop
but
finally
the
people
got
a
rope
around
pa
and
a
keeper
got
an
iron
hook
in
the
elephant
ear
and
they
pulled
pa
out
on
one
side
and
got
the
elephant
away
on
the
other
side
and
just
then
the
callipoe
that
ends
the
parade
came
by
us
and
played
the
blue
danube
and
the
elephant
got
on
his
hind
feet
and
waltzed
on
the
pavement
they
put
pa
and
the
circassian
beauties
in
a
patrol
wagon
and
took
them
to
the
show
lot
and
i
sat
by
the
driver
and
he
let
me
drive
the
team
illustration
the
elephant
kept
ducking
pa
and
swabbing
out
the
bottom
of
the
fountain
pa
had
his
sheik
clothes
rolled
up
around
his
waist
and
was
wringing
them
out
and
talking
awful
sassy
and
when
we
got
to
the
lot
it
took
a
long
time
to
convince
the
policemen
that
we
were
not
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct
and
just
then
the
elephant
came
tearing
by
us
with
the
keeper
on
horseback
behind
him
prodding
him
in
the
ham
every
jump
with
a
sharp
iron
and
he
went
through
the
side
of
the
tent
as
though
he
was
mighty
sorry
he
did
kill
us
all
they
made
him
get
down
on
his
knees
and
bellow
in
token
of
surrender
and
then
we
all
went
and
changed
our
clothes
for
the
afternoon
performance
as
we
passed
through
the
menagerie
tent
dripping
every
animal
set
up
a
yell
as
much
as
to
say
there
maybe
you
will
give
cayenne
pepper
to
a
pious
sacred
cow
again
confound
you
and
that
convinces
me
that
animals
are
human
the
last
week
has
been
the
hardest
on
pa
of
any
week
since
we
have
been
out
with
the
circus
the
trouble
with
pa
is
that
he
wants
to
be
johnny
on
the
spot
as
the
boys
say
and
if
anything
breaks
he
volunteers
to
go
to
work
and
fix
it
and
if
anybody
is
sick
or
disabled
he
wants
to
take
their
place
as
he
says
so
he
will
learn
everything
about
the
circus
and
be
competent
to
run
a
show
alone
next
year
but
it
was
a
mean
trick
the
principal
owner
of
the
show
played
on
pa
at
canton
o
you
see
john
sullivan
used
to
do
a
boxing
act
with
this
show
years
ago
and
everybody
likes
john
and
when
he
shows
up
where
the
show
gives
a
performance
he
has
the
freedom
of
the
whole
place
and
everybody
about
the
show
is
ready
to
fall
over
themselves
to
do
john
a
service
well
sullivan
showed
up
at
canton
and
he
went
everywhere
all
the
forenoon
and
met
all
the
old
timers
and
at
the
afternoon
performance
he
was
awfully
jolly
john
was
standing
beside
the
ring
when
the
japanese
jugglers
were
juggling
and
he
leaned
against
a
pole
pa
came
in
from
the
menagerie
tent
and
he
did
know
sullivan
and
when
he
saw
sullivan
holding
the
pole
up
pa
said
to
the
boss
proprietor
that
the
fat
man
who
was
interfering
with
the
show
ought
to
be
called
down
or
put
out
the
boss
said
to
pa
you
go
take
him
by
the
ear
and
put
him
out
and
pa
who
is
as
brave
as
lion
started
for
sullivan
and
the
boss
winked
at
the
other
circus
men
and
pa
went
up
to
sullivan
and
took
hold
of
john
neck
with
both
hands
and
said
come
on
out
of
here
well
sir
we
ought
to
have
moving
pictures
of
what
followed
sullivan
turned
on
pa
and
growled
just
like
a
lion
then
he
took
pa
around
the
waist
and
held
him
up
under
his
arm
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
board
and
slatted
pa
just
as
though
pa
was
a
child
and
the
audience
just
yelled
and
pa
called
to
the
circus
men
for
help
but
they
just
laughed
illustration
john
slatted
pa
just
as
though
he
was
a
child
pa
got
a
chance
at
the
fat
man
and
he
hit
him
in
the
jaw
but
it
did
not
hurt
sullivan
only
made
him
mad
he
took
pa
up
by
the
collar
and
whirled
him
around
until
pa
was
dizzy
and
then
he
started
with
him
for
the
menagerie
tent
and
called
to
the
boss
canvasman
bill
come
on
and
tell
me
which
is
the
hungriest
lion
and
i
will
feed
him
with
this
cold
meat
pa
yelled
he
thought
he
was
in
the
hands
of
an
escaped
lunatic
and
the
circus
hands
came
and
took
him
away
then
the
owner
told
pa
who
sullivan
was
and
pa
almost
fainted
but
finally
after
breathing
hard
for
awhile
pa
went
up
to
sullivan
and
shook
his
hand
and
said
sullivan
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
had
known
you
were
the
great
john
i
would
not
have
licked
you
sullivan
looked
at
pa
and
said
well
you
are
a
wonder
old
man
and
you
did
do
me
up
and
pa
and
sullivan
became
great
friends
since
then
pa
is
pretty
chesty
the
circus

ohio
was
a

for
the

business
and
kentucky
got
the
whole
bunch
ready
for
a
long
stay
at
dwight
but
the
agent
routed
us
into
pennsylvania
and
pa
has
had
nothing
but
a
series
of
disasters
since
striking
the
state
pa
gave
notice
that
when
we
got
to
his
old
home
at
scranton
where
he
lived
when
he
was
a
boy
he
wanted
to
sort
of
run
things
so
his
old
neighbors
would
see
that
he
had
got
up
in
the
world
since
he
left
the
old
town
so
the
manager
gave
pa
about
free
tickets
to
distribute
among
his
friends
and
arranged
for
pa
to
show
off
as
the
leading
citizen
in
the
show
he
was
offered
a
chance
to
take
the
place
of
the
clown
the
ring
master
or
anybody
whose
duty
he
thought
he
could
perform
pa
selected
the
place
of
driver
of
the
roman
chariot
with
four
horses
abreast
in
place
of
the
irish
roman
who
was
accustomed
to
drive
the
chariot
in
the
race
with
the
female
charioteer
a
muscular
girl
who
used
to
clerk
in
a
livery
stable
at
chicago
the
chariot
race
is
a
fake
because
it
is
arranged
for
the
girl
to
win
so
the
audience
will
go
wild
and
cheer
her
so
she
has
to
come
bowing
all
around
the
ring
the
way
the
job
is
put
up
is
for
the
two
chariots
to
start
and
go
around
twice
on
the
first
turn
the
man
driver
is
ahead
and
takes
the
pole
and
on
the
second
turn
the
girl
ahead
and
she
takes
the
pole
and
on
the
third
turn
the
man
is
ahead
and
they
begin
to
whip
the
horses
who
seem
crazy
and
on
the
last
stretch
the
man
holds
his
team
back
a
little
and
the
girl
passes
him
and
comes
out
a
trifle
ahead
and
the
crowd
goes
wild
well
the
master
of
ceremonies
coached
pa
about
the
business
and
told
him
what
to
do
they
knew
he
could
drive
four
horses
because
he
said
he
was
an
old
stage
driver
and
when
he
got
in
the
chariot
with
the
roman
suit
on
gleaming
with
gold
and
the
brass
helmet
and
the
cloth
of
gold
gauntlets
and
stood
up
like
a
senator
gee
i
was
proud
of
him
and
when
he
and
the
female
drove
out
of
the
and
halted
by
the
door
for
the
announcer
to
announce
the
great
ben
hur
chariot
race
i
got
into
the
chariot
behind
pa
and
told
him
he
must
win
the
race
or
the
people
of
scranton
would
mob
him
for
they
knew
these
races
were
usually
fixed
beforehand
but
since
he
was
to
drive
one
of
the
teams
all
his
friends
were
betting
on
him
and
if
he
pulled
the
team
and
let
that
livery
stable
lady
win
the
race
they
would
accuse
him
of
giving
free
tickets
to
get
them
in
the
show
and
skin
them
out
of
their
money
pa
said
to
me
this
race
is
going
to
be
on
the
square
and
you
watch
my
smoke
do
you
think
i
would
let
that
dish
washer
beat
me
not
on
your
life
the
play
is
to
have
a
little
boy
kiss
the
male
driver
and
a
little
girl
kiss
the
female
driver
as
though
they
were
taking
their
lives
in
their
hands
i
had
climbed
up
to
pa
and
put
my
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
and
a
girl
kissed
the
female
when
the
gong
sounded
and
both
teams
made
a
jump
before
i
could
get
out
of
the
chariot
so
i
got
right
in
front
of
pa
and
peeked
over
the
dashboard
of
the
chariot
and
gee
but
did
we
fairly
whizz
by
the
poles
and
the
audience
looked
like
a
panorama
pa
got
the
pole
and
kept
it
and
we
went
around
three
times
and
found
the
female
chariot
ahead
of
us
cause
pa
had
gone
around
twice
to
her
once
she
turned
out
a
little
right
by
the
and
pa
run
his
team
right
inside
her
chariot
and
caught
her
wheel
and
when
he
yelled
to
his
team
her
cart
team
and
all
were
thrown
right
into
the
band
which
scattered
over
the
backs
of
the
seats
the
horses
were
all
mixed
up
with
the
instruments
and
the
female
driver
was
thrown
into
the
air
and
came
down
in
a
sitting
position
right
into
the
bass
drum
she
went
right
through
the
sheepskin
so
her
head
and
hands
and
feet
were
all
of
her
that
remained
outside
the
drum
illustration
her
cart
team
and
all
were
thrown
right
against
the
band
she
yelled
for
help
and
the
circus
hands
rolled
the
drum
with
her
in
it
into
the
where
they
had
to
cut
the
sides
of
the
drum
with
an
ax
to
get
her
out
while
others
caught
her
horses
and
pulled
the
chariot
out
of
the
band
and
the
music
stopped
but
pa
went
on
forever
he
went
around
six
times
yelling
like
an
indian
at
a
green
corn
dance
and
when
he
thought
it
was
time
to
let
up
because
he
had
missed
the
other
chariot
he
pulled
so
hard
he
broke
the
lines
on
the
two
inside
horses
and
then
it
was
a
runaway
for
sure
and
the
audience
stood
up
on
the
seats
and
yelled
and
women
fainted
finally
the
circus
hands
grabbed
some
hurdles
and
threw
them
across
the
track
near
the
main
entrance
and
when
we
came
around
the
last
time
two
of
the
horses
jumped
the
hurdles
all
right
but
two
fumbled
and
fell
down
and
there
was
a
crash
and
i
did
know
anything
until
i
felt
cold
water
on
my
face
that
tasted
sour
and
colored
my
shirt
red
and
i
found
the
lemonade
butcher
was
bringing
me
to
by
pouring
a
tray
of
lemonade
over
me
when
my
eyes
opened
i
saw
a
sight
that
i
shall
never
forget
it
seems
that
when
the
horses
fell
down
the
chariot
and
the
other
two
horses
and
pa
and
i
had
landed
all
in
a
heap
right
on
top
of
the
lemonade
and
peanut
concession
and
carried
it
up
onto
a
row
of
seats
near
the
main
entrance
from
the
menagerie
the
elephants
that
were
to
come
on
next
were
in
the
door
waiting
for
their
signal
and
they
were
scared
at
the
crash
and
they
came
in
bellowing
the
keepers
having
lost
all
control
of
them
the
audience
was
stampeding
and
the
circus
men
were
trying
to
straighten
things
out
pa
struck
on
his
head
against
a
wagon
wheel
and
his
brass
helmet
was
driven
down
over
his
face
so
when
he
yelled
to
be
pulled
out
of
the
helmet
his
voice
sounded
like
a
coon
song
coming
from
a
phonograph
it
was
the
closest
call
from
death
pa
ever
had
they
had
to
cut
the
helmet
with
a
can
opener
to
let
pa
out
like
you
open
a
can
of
lobsters
when
they
got
the
helmet
opened
so
pa
could
come
out
he
looked
just
like
a
boiled
lobster
and
when
the
chief
owner
of
the
circus
came
up
on
a
run
and
asked
if
pa
was
dead
pa
said
not
much
mary
ann
did
i
win
and
the
manager
said
it
was
a
pity
they
ever
opened
that
helmet
and
let
pa
out
the
man
told
pa
he
won
in
a
walk
but
the
chief
of
police
of
scranton
was
going
to
arrest
pa
for
exceeding
the
speed
limit
illustration
pa
struck
on
his
head
against
a
wagon
wheel
they
took
pa
to
the
on
a
piece
of
board
and
when
the
woman
driver
saw
him
she
got
an
ax
and
wanted
to
cleave
him
from
head
to
foot
but
the
bearded
woman
stepped
in
front
of
her
and
said
not
on
your
life
and
she
shielded
pa
from
death
with
her
manly
form
which
pa
says
he
shall
never
forget
pa
old
friends
in
scranton
gave
him
a
banquet
that
night
but
pa
could
eat
anything
cause
the
rim
of
the
brass
helmet
cut
a
gash
in
his
adam
apple
after
the
chariot
race
the
managers
concluded
they
would
let
pa
have
any
position
of
importance
again
very
soon
and
i
made
up
my
mind
you
would
ever
catch
me
in
any
game
that
pa
was
in
but
in
the
circus
business
you
can
never
tell
what
is
going
to
happen
from
one
day
to
another
on
the
train
on
the
way
to
wilkes
barre
there
was
a
hot
box
on
one
of
the
sleepers
and
the
car
was
all
night
when
we
arrived
at
the
town
about
wagon
drivers
that
were
in
the
car
did
not
show
up
and
they
had
to
press
everybody
that
could
drive
a
team
into
the
service
to
haul
the
stuff
to
the
lot
and
pa
drove
four
horses
so
well
with
a
load
of
tent
poles
that
the
manager
complimented
pa
and
that
gave
pa
the
big
head
when
the
parade
was
all
ready
to
start
through
town
and
the
drivers
had
not
arrived
the
manager
asked
pa
if
he
thought
he
could
drive
the
ten
gray
horses
on
the
band
wagon
to
lead
the
procession
and
pa
said
driving
ten
horses
was
his
best
hold
and
he
got
up
on
the
driver
seat
and
called
me
to
get
up
with
him
and
i
hate
a
boy
that
will
disobey
a
parent
so
i
climbed
up
and
began
to
jolly
the
band
about
the
chariot
race
and
i
told
them
pa
would
do
a
thing
to
them
this
time
the
manager
of
the
show
always
rides
ahead
of
the
parade
with
the
chief
of
police
of
the
town
and
the
band
horses
follow
him
so
it
is
easy
enough
to
drive
ten
horses
cause
all
you
have
to
do
it
to
hold
on
to
the
lines
and
look
savage
at
the
crowd
on
the
sidewalks
and
the
horses
go
right
along
and
the
people
think
the
driver
is
a
wonder
so
when
the
manager
started
in
his
buggy
pa
pulled
up
on
all
the
lines
he
could
hold
on
to
which
filled
his
lap
and
made
him
look
like
a
harness
maker
and
he
yelled
and
the
procession
moved
and
the
ten
teams
pa
was
driving
went
along
all
right
and
pa
looked
as
though
he
owned
the
show
and
the
town
we
got
downtown
to
a
wide
street
and
there
was
a
fire
alarm
ahead
or
something
and
the
procession
stopped
and
the
manager
and
chief
of
police
disappeared
and
there
was
a
wagon
load
of
green
corn
stalks
right
beside
the
lead
team
which
a
farmer
was
taking
to
a
silo
but
he
had
stopped
his
team
to
see
the
parade
the
three
teams
of
pa
leaders
six
horses
began
to
eat
the
corn
stalks
and
the
camels
that
were
behind
us
worked
along
up
by
the
band
wagon
and
began
to
eat
and
the
farmer
got
scared
to
see
his
corn
stalks
disappearing
so
he
drove
off
on
a
side
street
and
started
for
the
silo
and
by
ginger
pa
team
turned
onto
the
side
street
and
followed
the
wagon
of
corn
stalks
and
pa
could
hold
them
and
the
band
played
in
the
good
old
summer
time
there
will
be
a
hot
time
in
the
old
town
the
camels
kept
up
with
the
farmer
wagon
too
and
the
whole
parade
followed
the
band
the
farmer
started
his
horses
into
a
run
and
the
team
of
ten
horses
that
was
driving
pa
started
to
galloping
and
i
looked
back
and
the
elephants
were
beginning
to
gallop
and
all
the
cages
were
coming
whooping
and
it
was
a
picnic
the
band
stopped
playing
and
the
players
were
scared
and
as
we
were
crossing
a
little
bridge
over
a
small
stream
on
the
edge
of
town
i
turned
around
to
the
band
and
told
them
to
jump
for
their
lives
and
they
all
made
a
jump
for
the
stream
and
the
air
was
full
of
uniforms
and
instruments
and
they
landed
in
the
stream
all
right
we
went
on
up
a
hill
and
were
in
the
country
and
the
farmer
turned
into
a
farmyard
and
the
band
wagon
followed
and
the
farmer
jumped
off
the
corn
stalk
wagon
and
rushed
for
the
house
and
pa
team
surrounded
the
wagon
and
every
horse
was
eating
corn
stalks
and
the
team
was
all
mixed
up
the
camels
and
the
elephants
crowded
in
for
the
nice
green
lunch
and
the
farmer
wife
came
out
with
her
apron
waving
and
said
shoo
but
none
of
the
animals
shooed
worth
a
cent
and
pa
pulled
on
the
lines
and
yelled
while
the
rest
of
the
parade
came
into
the
farm
and
lined
up
the
drivers
yelled
at
pa
to
know
where
in
thunder
he
was
going
and
pa
said
damfino
just
then
the
manager
and
chief
of
police
came
up
and
the
way
they
talked
to
pa
was
awful
pa
could
explain
how
it
was
that
he
took
the
parade
out
in
the
country
and
you
never
saw
such
a
time
by
this
time
the
regular
drivers
had
arrived
on
a
special
from
where
we
left
them
with
a
hot
box
and
they
took
possession
of
the
teams
and
we
got
back
to
the
circus
lot
in
time
for
the
afternoon
performance
i
do
know
what
they
are
doing
to
pa
but
they
had
him
in
the
tent
all
the
afternoon
with
some
doctors
who
seem
to
be
examining
him
for
insanity
everybody
about
the
show
thinks
pa
has
hoodooed
the
aggregation
but
pa
says
such
things
are
always
happening
and
it
is
wrong
to
blame
him
the
farmer
got
paid
for
his
corn
stalks
and
it
is
to
be
charged
up
to
chapter
xi
the
bad
boy
and
his
pa
in
a
railroad
wreck
pa
rescues
the
other
freaks
they
spend
the
night
on
a
meadow
a
claim
agent
settles
for
damages
pa
plays
deaf
and
dumb
and
gets
ten
thousand
it
has
come
at
last
everybody
about
the
show
expects
that
the
show
has
got
to
have
a
railroad
wreck
every
season
and
all
hands
lay
awake
nights
on
the
cars
to
brace
themselves
for
the
shock
sometimes
it
comes
early
in
the
season
and
again
a
show
goes
along
until
almost
the
end
of
the
season
without
a
and
fellows
think
maybe
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
wreck
but
the
engineers
are
only
waiting
till
everybody
has
forgotten
about
it
and
then
biff
bang
and
they
have
run
into
another
train
or
been
run
into
and
you
have
to
be
pulled
out
of
a
window
by
the
heels
and
laid
out
in
a
marsh
until
the
claim
agents
can
settle
with
you
i
always
thought
in
reading
of
railroad
accidents
that
the
railroad
sent
out
a
special
trainload
of
doctors
and
nurses
to
care
for
the
injured
but
the
special
train
never
has
a
doctor
until
the
lawyers
give
first
aid
to
the
wounded
in
the
way
of
financial
poultices
for
the
cripples
people
in
our
business
are
on
the
railroads
and
we
work
them
for
all
there
is
in
it
and
the
man
that
is
hurt
the
least
makes
the
biggest
howl
and
gets
the
biggest
slice
of
indemnity
some
circus
people
spend
all
their
salary
as
they
go
along
and
live
all
winter
on
the
damages
they
get
from
the
railroads
when
the
wreck
comes
the
night
of
the
wreck
our
train
was
whooping
along
at
about
miles
an
hour
on
a
railroad
in
pennsylvania
and
the
night
was
hot
and
the
mosquitoes
from
across
the
line
in
new
jersey
were
singing
their
solemn
tunes
and
pa
who
attended
a
lodge
meeting
that
night
at
the
town
we
showed
in
was
asleep
and
talking
in
his
sleep
about
passwords
and
grips
and
the
freaks
and
trapeze
performers
in
our
car
had
got
through
kicking
about
how
the
show
was
running
into
the
ground
when
suddenly
there
was
a
terrific
ahead
an
engine
boiler
exploded
a
freight
car
of
dynamite
on
a
side
track
exploded
and
there
was
a
grinding
and
bumping
of
cars
then
they
rolled
down
a
bank
over
and
over
so
the
upper
berth
was
the
lower
berth
half
the
time
and
finally
the
whole
business
stopped
in
a
hay
marsh
and
the
bilge
water
in
the
marsh
leaked
into
the
hold
of
our
car
people
screamed
and
some
one
yelled
fire
and
i
pulled
on
pa
till
he
woke
up
i
thought
pa
head
was
all
caved
in
because
he
talked
nutty
the
first
thing
he
said
was
say
i
pronounce
your
name
and
repeat
after
me
and
then
he
said
i
promise
and
swear
that
i
will
never
reveal
the
secrets
of
this
degree
and
then
the
conductor
pulled
pa
leg
and
said
crawl
out
of
the
window
old
man
the
train
is
in
the
ditch
the
car
is
afire
and
if
you
do
get
out
in
about
a
minute
with
the
other
freaks
you
will
be
a
burnt
offering
pa
said
you
could
fool
him
he
knew
he
was
being
initiated
into
the
degree
of
the
masons
and
he
guessed
he
could
tell
a
degree
from
a
train
wreck
the
degree
was
a
darn
sight
worse
than
a
wreck
but
the
conductor
took
one
of
those
long
glass
fire
extinguishers
and
sprinkled
the
medicated
water
on
the
freaks
in
the
next
berth
and
then
turned
it
on
pa
and
pa
tasted
it
and
thought
he
was
at
a
banquet
and
he
said
that
sauterne
is
not
fit
to
drink
then
when
the
bearded
woman
yelled
that
the
fire
had
almost
reached
her
whiskers
and
would
nobody
save
her
pa
began
to
get
ready
to
move
on
he
concluded
he
had
been
riding
a
goat
after
all
and
he
told
me
to
hand
him
his
pants
pa
is
a
man
that
will
never
go
out
among
people
no
matter
how
dark
the
night
is
without
his
pants
and
i
admire
him
for
it
some
of
the
circus
men
did
care
for
dress
that
night
but
got
out
just
as
they
were
and
the
result
was
that
when
daylight
came
they
had
to
tie
hay
around
their
legs
our
car
was
up
but
i
found
pa
pants
and
he
got
his
legs
in
and
i
buttoned
him
in
but
i
felt
all
the
time
as
though
i
had
buttoned
them
in
the
back
so
the
seat
was
in
front
but
the
fire
was
crackling
and
pa
pushed
me
out
of
a
transom
and
then
he
crawled
out
and
we
sat
down
in
the
mud
the
bearded
woman
came
next
with
her
whiskers
done
up
in
curl
papers
and
then
the
fat
woman
got
one
foot
through
the
transom
and
she
could
get
it
back
in
and
the
train
hands
got
an
ax
and
were
going
to
cut
her
leg
off
and
save
one
foot
at
least
when
pa
got
a
move
on
him
and
took
the
ax
and
broke
out
the
side
of
the
car
and
got
her
out
eight
or
nine
men
lifted
her
tenderly
onto
a
stack
of
hay
and
she
wrapped
it
around
her
she
left
her
clothes
in
her
berth
illustration
pa
got
an
ax
and
cut
the
fat
woman
out
well
it
was
a
sight
when
the
people
were
got
out
of
our
car
and
they
let
it
burn
to
light
up
the
scene
and
pa
and
i
and
the
boss
canvasman
went
along
the
ditched
train
and
helped
people
out
the
giant
was
in
two
upper
berths
and
he
got
one
leg
out
of
the
transom
over
one
berth
and
one
leg
out
of
the
transom
over
the
other
berth
and
we
pulled
his
legs
but
he
could
make
it
so
pa
took
an
ax
and
made
both
berths
into
one
and
got
him
out
the
giant
shook
himself
and
started
on
a
run
across
the
marsh
but
he
mired
up
to
his
neck
and
a
farmer
who
heard
the
noise
came
to
order
us
off
his
hay
field
for
trespass
and
yelled
here
a
head
of
some
of
your
performers
cut
off
away
over
here
and
he
was
going
to
bring
it
in
when
the
farmer
found
the
head
was
alive
and
he
ran
away
from
it
in
an
hour
we
had
everybody
out
and
made
beds
for
them
by
spreading
out
hay
cocks
and
nobody
seemed
to
be
hurt
so
very
much
we
heard
a
locomotive
whistle
up
the
road
and
some
one
said
the
relief
train
was
coming
with
doctors
and
nurses
but
the
show
owner
who
was
with
us
said
relief
doctors
nothing
that
is
a
of
lawyers
and
claim
agents
to
settle
with
us
the
doctors
will
not
come
till
now
everybody
pretend
to
be
hurt
awful
bad
and
strike
the
sharks
for
apiece
and
come
down
to
if
you
ca
do
any
better
it
was
getting
daylight
and
the
relief
train
stopped
and
the
good
samaritans
came
wading
into
the
hay
marsh
bent
on
settling
with
us
cheap
the
first
lawyer
asked
the
principal
owner
how
many
were
killed
they
could
figure
exactly
how
much
they
have
to
pay
for
a
dead
one
but
the
live
ones
are
the
ones
that
make
trouble
for
a
railroad
they
can
kick
and
argue
the
boss
said
nobody
was
dead
but
the
giant
who
was
mired
in
out
of
sight
the
giant
heard
what
was
said
and
he
yelled
that
he
was
alive
and
would
settle
for
less
than
but
the
claim
agent
said
the
giant
would
be
dead
in
minutes
in
that
quicksand
so
he
would
let
him
sink
and
pay
for
him
as
a
dead
one
the
giant
said
if
they
would
pull
him
out
of
the
mud
he
would
settle
for
and
they
pulled
him
out
and
the
rest
of
the
injured
were
going
to
mob
him
for
settling
so
cheap
one
of
the
claim
agents
found
the
bearded
woman
sitting
on
a
hay
cock
combing
out
her
whiskers
and
asked
what
it
would
take
to
settle
and
she
said
and
she
got
up
and
walked
over
to
another
hay
cock
where
the
circassian
beauty
was
drying
her
hair
and
the
claim
agent
looked
at
how
spry
the
bearded
woman
walked
and
he
said
to
the
boss
i
wo
give
that
fellow
with
the
curly
whiskers
a
single
kopeck
and
the
bearded
woman
came
back
and
swatted
the
claim
agent
for
calling
her
a
fellow
so
they
compromised
on
and
she
went
behind
the
haystack
and
put
it
in
her
stocking
which
convinced
the
claim
agent
that
she
was
a
man
a
claim
agent
came
to
the
haystack
where
the
fat
woman
was
and
the
boss
told
her
now
was
her
time
to
have
a
mess
of
hysterics
so
she
set
up
a
cry
that
scared
the
agent
who
thought
there
were
at
least
six
women
on
the
haystack
and
he
said
what
will
all
of
you
people
up
there
on
the
haystack
settle
for
in
a
lump
for
i
am
in
a
hurry
the
fat
woman
caught
on
at
once
and
said
we
will
all
settle
for
then
she
yelled
and
the
agent
thought
her
back
was
broke
and
he
offered
and
she
cried
and
said
make
it
and
the
agent
said
i
will
go
you
and
he
made
out
a
check
and
the
fat
woman
had
some
more
hysterics
i
had
watched
the
settling
all
around
and
i
told
pa
to
be
deaf
and
dumb
when
they
came
to
him
and
just
point
to
the
seat
of
his
pants
in
front
and
buttoned
up
behind
and
look
as
though
he
was
suffering
the
tortures
of
the
inquisition
and
let
me
do
the
talking
and
i
would
make
the
old
railroad
go
into
a
receiver
hands
so
pa
said
you
are
the
boss
and
he
looked
so
pitiful
that
i
almost
cried
when
the
claim
agent
came
to
pa
i
told
him
that
pa
last
words
were
to
beg
to
be
shot
and
the
man
looked
at
pa
pants
and
then
at
his
face
and
said
what
hit
him
that
the
worst
case
i
ever
saw
in
a
railroad
wreck
illustration
what
hit
him
that
the
worst
case
i
ever
saw
i
put
my
handkerchief
to
my
eyes
and
said
well
when
the
shock
came
pa
was
all
right
as
handsome
a
man
as
you
would
often
see
i
think
there
must
have
been
a
pile
driver
on
the
train
that
struck
him
and
changed
sides
with
him
knocking
his
stomach
around
on
the
back
side
of
him
and
placing
his
spinal
column
around
in
front
of
him
where
his
stomach
was
and
causing
him
to
lose
the
sense
of
speech
think
of
a
man
going
through
life
mixed
up
in
that
manner
having
to
sit
down
on
his
stomach
and
having
his
backbone
staring
him
in
the
face
how
does
he
know
when
he
takes
food
in
his
mouth
that
it
can
corkscrew
around
under
his
arm
and
eventually
find
his
stomach
how
a
man
can
be
ground
and
twisted
and
mauled
and
stamped
on
by
a
reckless
locomotive
with
a
crazy
engineer
and
a
drunken
fireman
rolled
over
by
box
cars
and
walked
on
by
elephants
and
still
live
is
beyond
me
as
he
told
me
before
he
lost
the
power
of
speech
not
to
be
too
hard
on
the
railroad
company
though
some
railroads
would
be
glad
to
pay
him
and
no
questions
asked
he
begged
me
as
heir
to
his
estate
to
let
you
off
for
a
paltry
pa
made
up
the
darndest
face
and
groaned
the
agent
called
another
agent
and
they
whispered
together
and
finally
the
first
one
came
to
me
and
asked
pa
full
name
and
then
the
two
of
them
got
out
a
fountain
pen
and
they
made
out
a
check
and
he
said
this
is
the
first
case
in
the
history
of
railroad
wrecking
that
the
agent
has
not
had
the
heart
to
try
to
beat
the
injured
party
down
this
is
certainly
the
most
pitiful
case
that
has
ever
been
known
and
if
your
father
ever
comes
to
his
senses
you
can
tell
him
he
is
welcome
to
the
money
the
agents
shook
hands
with
pa
and
i
and
went
away
to
their
train
and
pa
winked
at
me
and
a
wrecking
train
came
and
we
got
on
a
special
and
got
to
pittsburg
before
breakfast
and
pa
is
going
to
buy
me
a
dog
out
of
the
money
gee
but
there
is
all
kinds
of
money
in
the
circus
business
pa
is
going
to
wear
his
pants
hind
side
before
until
we
get
out
of
pittsburg
chapter
xii
the
bad
boy
causes
trouble
between
the
russian
cossacks
and
the
jap
jugglers
a
jap
walker
pa
the
animals
go
on
a
strike
pa
runs
the
menagerie
for
a
day
and
wins
their
gratitude
i
did
not
mean
any
harm
when
i
told
the
japanese
jugglers
that
they
ought
to
kick
against
having
those
russian
cavalrymen
in
the
show
the
fellows
who
ride
horses
standing
up
in
the
department
i
had
listened
to
their
russian
talk
and
it
seemed
to
me
they
were
spies
who
were
looking
for
a
chance
to
do
injury
to
the
poor
little
japs
i
could
see
that
i
made
the
japs
mad
the
first
thing
and
then
i
told
them
that
pa
and
all
the
managers
of
the
show
felt
sorry
for
the
little
japs
some
day
the
big
russians
would
ride
right
over
them
and
kill
them
right
in
the
ring
i
said
that
everybody
thought
the
japs
ought
to
resign
from
the
show
for
fear
of
a
clash
with
the
russians
or
else
they
ought
to
have
some
grown
persons
to
act
as
chaperones
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
look
of
scorn
on
the
faces
of
the
jap
jugglers
when
the
interpreter
told
them
that
the
circus
people
were
afraid
the
russians
would
hurt
them
they
jabbered
awhile
and
then
the
interpreter
told
me
that
the
ten
little
japs
could
whip
the
russians
in
four
minutes
probably
it
was
none
of
my
business
and
i
never
ought
to
have
repeated
it
but
in
a
circus
everybody
wants
to
know
everything
that
is
going
on
so
when
the
big
leader
of
the
russians
asked
me
what
those
brown
monkeys
were
talking
about
i
told
him
nothing
particular
only
they
say
the
ten
of
them
could
lick
you
russians
in
four
minutes
gee
did
that
russian
talk
kopec
and
damski
and
froth
at
the
mouth
then
he
called
his
russians
together
and
the
talk
sounded
as
though
a
soda
fountain
had
burst
then
they
all
yelled
killovitch
the
illustration
gee
but
did
that
russian
talk
kopec
and
damski
i
went
and
told
pa
there
was
going
to
be
a
riot
between
the
jap
jugglers
and
the
russian
horsemen
and
probably
the
fight
would
take
place
when
the
japs
came
out
of
the
ring
at
the
afternoon
performance
and
the
russians
went
in
right
near
the
i
asked
pa
not
to
mix
in
it
but
keep
away
in
the
animal
tent
pa
said
not
much
he
would
be
away
and
he
told
all
the
managers
and
they
all
got
around
the
to
stop
the
muss
if
one
started
well
to
show
how
the
japs
were
organized
as
soon
as
they
felt
there
was
going
to
be
a
row
they
kept
their
eyes
on
the
russians
all
the
time
they
were
in
the
ring
doing
their
pole
balancing
and
the
little
jap
up
on
the
bamboo
pole
with
a
fan
kept
jabbering
to
the
fellows
down
on
the
ground
and
i
could
see
that
trouble
was
coming
when
their
act
was
over
the
japs
bowed
to
the
audience
and
started
out
where
the
russians
were
lined
up
to
come
riding
in
the
big
russian
said
look
at
the
little
monkeys
but
he
had
got
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
before
the
japs
turned
and
every
man
grabbed
the
tail
of
every
other
horse
and
jumped
up
behind
the
russians
and
each
of
the
ten
japs
took
a
russian
by
the
neck
with
a
jiu
jitsu
strangle
hold
and
reached
out
his
leg
and
wound
it
around
the
russian
on
the
next
horse
and
in
ten
seconds
they
had
unhorsed
the
russians
the
whole
men
were
on
the
ground
rolling
in
the
sawdust
the
japs
rolling
over
and
under
the
russians
twisting
their
legs
and
arms
in
an
unknown
manner
and
making
them
yell
for
help
like
a
mastiff
that
has
trifled
in
an
overbearing
manner
with
a
little
bulldog
until
the
bulldog
got
mad
and
began
the
chewing
act
on
the
mastiff
fore
leg
it
was
the
worst
ever
was
and
the
managers
told
pa
to
put
a
stop
to
it
and
pa
pulled
off
his
coat
and
grabbed
the
first
jap
he
could
dig
out
and
began
to
pull
him
like
you
would
take
hold
of
the
leg
of
a
dog
in
a
fight
pa
said
here
quit
this
foolishness
there
is
an
armistice
and
the
war
is
over
anyway
o
o
but
the
jap
did
do
a
thing
to
pa
he
grabbed
pa
by
the
wrist
and
he
seemed
to
be
having
an
epileptic
fit
and
pa
leg
shot
out
so
his
feet
hit
a
guy
pole
and
then
the
jap
pulled
him
back
like
he
was
a
rubber
ball
on
a
string
and
then
he
took
pa
by
the
elbow
and
held
him
out
at
arm
length
and
then
swung
him
around
a
few
times
and
let
go
of
him
and
he
fell
down
among
the
reserved
seats
which
representatives
of
the
press
occupy
pa
stood
on
one
ear
on
a
crushed
chair
with
his
legs
over
the
railing
and
when
he
came
to
the
newspaper
men
wanted
to
interview
pa
said
all
he
remembered
was
that
the
air
ship
was
sailing
over
the
town
and
they
threw
him
out
for
ballast
and
he
struck
a
church
spire
and
bounded
onto
a
warehouse
filled
with
dynamite
which
exploded
when
he
struck
it
and
the
neighbors
picked
his
remains
up
on
a
dustpan
and
emptied
them
in
here
then
he
asked
if
his
head
was
on
straight
and
the
circusmen
took
him
away
to
the
hospital
tent
illustration
o
but
the
jap
did
do
a
thing
to
pa
the
circus
hands
separated
the
russians
and
japs
or
at
least
pulled
off
the
japs
and
the
russians
limped
to
the
and
their
act
was
cut
out
unless
the
terms
of
peace
between
japan
and
russia
include
the
belligerents
in
our
show
there
will
be
rows
every
day
pa
came
to
the
car
on
crutches
that
night
just
before
the
train
pulled
out
for
philadelphia
and
wanted
to
know
where
i
was
during
the
fight
he
said
he
rushed
right
in
and
grabbed
a
jap
in
one
hand
and
a
russian
in
the
other
and
bumped
their
heads
together
and
threw
one
of
them
towards
the
ring
and
the
other
up
among
the
seats
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
thought
he
killed
either
or
both
of
them
i
hate
a
boy
that
will
deceive
his
father
but
i
told
him
there
was
talk
about
two
performers
one
a
russian
and
the
other
a
jap
that
were
left
at
the
morgue
but
i
did
know
anything
sure
about
it
and
pa
said
i
was
afraid
i
should
hurt
them
but
they
brought
it
on
themselves
by
breaking
the
rules
of
the
show
against
fighting
during
a
performance
and
pa
rolled
over
and
groaned
in
his
berth
and
went
to
sleep
and
snored
so
the
freaks
wanted
to
have
a
nose
bag
such
as
horses
eat
out
of
pulled
over
pa
face
the
queerest
thing
that
ever
happened
in
the
circus
business
in
this
country
took
place
at
germantown
pa
the
teamsters
went
on
a
strike
at
pittsburg
for
increase
in
wages
and
shorter
hours
and
for
two
days
the
management
had
a
great
time
we
had
to
get
drays
to
haul
the
stuff
from
the
train
to
the
lot
and
then
our
teamsters
got
the
local
draymen
to
join
them
and
when
we
got
ready
to
haul
the
stuff
back
to
the
train
nobody
would
do
any
work
and
the
walking
delegates
from
the
teamsters
union
just
took
possession
of
the
show
and
we
were
stuck
like
an
automobile
when
the
gasoline
gives
out
we
had
got
to
looking
at
the
teamsters
as
of
no
particular
account
when
they
walked
out
but
when
they
would
work
they
became
the
most
important
part
of
the
show
and
after
the
show
was
over
the
managers
who
had
told
the
striking
teamsters
to
go
plumb
found
that
they
had
gone
plumb
and
they
had
to
rush
all
over
pittsburg
and
find
them
and
grant
their
demands
and
get
them
to
go
to
work
pa
was
sent
out
to
find
a
bunch
of
them
and
it
cost
pa
over
to
get
them
out
of
a
beer
garden
and
back
to
the
lot
and
it
was
almost
daylight
before
we
got
our
train
started
for
the
next
town
well
at
the
next
town
we
could
see
there
was
something
the
matter
with
the
animals
they
acted
as
though
they
had
lost
all
interest
in
the
success
of
the
show
and
would
do
any
of
their
stunts
worth
a
cent
the
elephants
went
through
their
act
carelessly
and
when
they
were
scolded
or
prodded
with
the
iron
hook
they
got
mad
and
wanted
to
fight
and
when
they
got
back
from
the
ring
to
the
animal
tent
they
eat
the
baled
hay
but
threw
it
all
over
the
tent
and
acted
riotous
the
kangaroos
would
not
do
their
boxing
act
the
horses
kicked
at
their
hay
and
would
eat
their
oats
the
camels
growled
at
their
food
and
scared
the
people
who
passed
by
where
they
were
tied
to
stakes
the
sacred
cattle
got
their
backs
up
and
acted
as
though
they
being
pious
could
swear
but
would
like
to
hire
the
hyenas
to
swear
for
them
the
giraffes
laid
down
and
curled
their
necks
so
they
were
no
attraction
to
the
show
a
giraffe
is
no
curiosity
unless
he
stretches
himself
away
up
towards
the
top
of
the
tent
the
zebras
rolled
in
the
mud
and
spoiled
their
stripes
so
people
could
tell
them
from
common
mules
the
grizzly
bear
walked
his
cage
and
kept
giving
vent
to
bear
language
and
the
big
lion
was
howling
all
the
time
the
show
was
a
failure
at
that
town
and
when
we
loaded
the
train
the
managers
held
a
meeting
in
our
car
to
decide
what
in
thunder
was
the
matter
with
the
animals
all
kinds
of
theories
were
advanced
such
as
poison
malaria
from
indiana
and
pure
cussedness
after
they
had
discussed
the
matter
awhile
pa
came
in
and
they
asked
him
what
he
thought
about
it
and
that
tickled
pa
as
foolish
as
he
looks
he
helps
the
show
out
of
lots
of
bad
holes
pa
lit
a
cigar
and
put
it
in
one
side
of
his
mouth
put
his
hat
up
on
one
side
of
his
head
like
he
was
tough
and
looked
wise
and
said
fellow
fakirs
i
have
been
watching
the
animals
all
day
and
while
i
do
not
say
they
understand
enough
of
the
ways
of
human
beings
to
be
posted
on
labor
unions
and
all
that
i
want
to
tell
you
they
are
on
a
strike
and
that
grizzly
and
that
lion
are
the
walking
delegates
that
are
stirring
them
up
to
mischief
they
may
not
know
anything
about
the
teamsters
strike
but
they
know
something
has
happened
and
they
are
displeased
at
something
and
they
have
lost
respect
for
the
employer
they
are
on
a
strike
and
the
very
devil
is
going
to
pay
unless
the
cause
of
the
dissatisfaction
is
discovered
mutual
concessions
made
and
arbitration
resorted
to
gentlemen
you
hear
me
said
pa
and
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
arm
of
the
car
seat
they
gave
pa
the
laugh
but
finally
told
him
to
take
charge
of
the
strike
and
settle
it
quick
but
they
wanted
to
know
what
he
thought
animals
would
be
dissatisfied
about
as
long
as
they
got
food
enough
to
eat
pa
said
i
tell
you
you
feed
the
horses
and
other
animals
on
musty
baled
hay
bought
from
contractors
that
may
have
had
it
on
hand
for
five
years
how
would
you
like
it
if
you
were
served
with
breakfast
food
that
had
been
stored
in
a
warehouse
until
it
was
mildewed
a
horse
or
an
elephant
has
feelings
give
them
baled
hay
and
when
they
are
trying
to
pick
out
a
mouthful
that
is
not
spoiled
you
drive
along
with
a
load
of
nice
timothy
or
alfalfa
and
see
them
make
a
rush
for
that
load
of
hay
the
way
my
team
did
the
other
day
for
that
load
of
cornstalks
then
the
sacred
cattle
are
hot
under
the
collar
because
of
the
fellows
who
use
profanity
can
you
imagine
a
sacred
cow
trying
to
be
good
and
set
a
pious
example
to
the
heathen
animals
being
patient
when
they
have
to
listen
to
swearing
you
buy
meat
that
is
tainted
for
the
lions
who
like
fresh
meat
and
the
jackal
that
only
loves
bad
meat
gets
the
only
sirloin
in
the
lot
let
me
run
the
menagerie
and
i
will
have
mr
lion
the
walking
delegate
declare
this
strike
off
well
they
told
pa
to
arbitrate
the
strike
and
the
next
day
he
had
a
couple
of
loads
of
timothy
hay
such
as
mother
used
to
make
driven
in
and
unloaded
and
the
horses
elephants
camels
and
things
almost
set
up
a
cheer
for
pa
the
animals
were
given
a
picnic
of
the
freshest
beef
with
a
little
so
decayed
that
it
was
only
fit
to
be
buried
for
the
hyenas
and
jackals
and
every
animal
was
happy
they
did
their
turns
better
than
ever
and
the
sacred
cattle
almost
acted
devilish
now
the
animals
have
declared
the
strike
off
and
they
want
to
lick
hand
the
owners
of
the
show
appreciate
genius
and
they
have
raised
pa
salary
and
given
him
full
charge
of
the
menagerie
chapter
xiii
the
circus
strikes
the
quaker
city
they
go
on
a
ginger
ale
jag
pa
breaks
up
an
indian
war
dance
and
comes
near
being
burned
alive
the
world
fair
cannibals
have
a
roast
dog
feast
ever
since
we
knew
the
show
was
billed
for
philadelphia
for
a
saturday
and
that
we
should
have
to
stay
over
sunday
in
that
town
there
has
been
symptoms
of
a
revolt
everybody
connected
with
the
show
has
a
horror
of
being
found
dead
in
philadelphia
they
claim
it
is
too
dead
for
live
people
and
not
very
satisfactory
to
dead
people
a
performer
who
was
with
the
show
last
year
says
that
nobody
but
the
newspaper
people
who
had
free
tickets
attended
the
performances
and
some
of
them
would
go
in
the
tent
unless
the
press
agent
promised
to
set
up
a
free
lunch
with
devilish
ginger
ale
to
drink
and
that
the
press
people
got
riotous
on
ginger
ale
a
ginger
ale
jag
is
terrible
when
a
man
is
full
of
ginger
ale
his
intestines
loop
the
loop
and
tie
up
in
knots
and
gripe
like
cholera
infantum
and
unless
his
friends
hold
him
he
goes
out
into
the
world
and
wants
to
kill
the
women
and
children
and
last
year
our
press
agents
filled
up
the
members
of
the
local
press
with
ginger
ale
and
when
we
struck
philadelphia
this
time
the
newspapers
had
sworn
out
warrants
for
our
show
on
the
charge
of
compounding
a
felony
which
i
suppose
is
the
legal
name
for
ginger
ale
the
way
the
quakers
patronize
a
show
is
to
put
on
their
gray
clothes
and
their
big
white
hats
and
stand
on
the
corners
when
the
parade
goes
by
and
never
crack
a
smile
or
act
interested
and
when
the
parade
has
passed
they
go
to
the
circus
lot
and
see
the
balloon
ascension
and
stand
on
wagon
wheels
and
try
to
look
over
the
side
of
the
tent
at
the
performance
and
then
they
kick
because
the
audience
on
the
back
seats
cut
off
their
view
from
the
wagon
wheels
last
year
our
show
killed
a
quaker
and
the
community
is
down
on
us
the
quaker
got
in
the
show
because
he
owned
a
half
inch
of
ground
that
its
tents
were
on
and
he
stood
right
by
the
ring
and
when
the
champion
female
rider
was
suspended
in
the
air
between
two
bareback
horses
he
leaned
over
too
far
inside
the
ring
and
she
kicked
his
hat
clear
up
to
the
roof
of
the
tent
and
a
female
trapeze
performer
up
there
caught
it
and
sat
down
on
it
on
the
trapeze
the
old
quaker
had
heart
disease
and
fell
dead
what
the
quakers
complained
of
was
that
after
the
remains
had
been
removed
from
the
ring
that
the
show
went
right
on
they
claimed
that
we
ought
to
have
shown
proper
respect
for
the
dead
by
closing
the
show
for
days
and
wearing
crape
on
our
arms
but
a
circus
is
not
built
that
way
ordinarily
it
may
be
quiet
enough
in
philadelphia
on
sunday
but
pa
found
that
he
had
more
of
a
run
for
his
money
than
at
any
place
we
have
been
so
far
we
have
had
a
tribe
of
indians
with
our
wild
west
department
all
summer
and
pa
has
not
stood
very
well
with
the
indians
since
he
was
in
charge
of
the
show
at
fort
wayne
and
they
all
got
drunk
and
he
had
them
tied
up
to
the
poles
around
the
ring
until
they
got
sober
they
have
laid
for
pa
ever
since
and
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
when
they
got
him
then
at
pittsburg
our
manager
picked
up
a
company
of
cannibals
that
had
got
left
over
from
the
louis
fair
and
who
agreed
to
perform
for
their
board
and
clothes
and
as
they
wear
any
clothes
to
speak
of
and
only
eat
dog
week
days
and
hope
to
get
a
human
being
to
roast
on
sunday
it
seemed
a
pretty
good
bargain
well
the
indians
got
permission
to
hold
a
green
corn
dance
in
a
piece
of
woods
near
the
circus
lot
and
the
management
got
them
a
wagon
load
of
corn
and
they
had
built
a
fire
and
were
roasting
the
corn
and
dancing
and
pa
did
know
about
it
and
just
after
dark
the
quaker
who
owned
the
woods
complained
to
pa
who
was
on
watch
sunday
night
that
his
indians
had
got
off
the
reservation
and
were
preparing
to
go
on
the
warpath
and
he
wanted
them
to
get
off
his
premises
pa
said
he
would
go
right
over
and
drive
them
back
to
the
tents
i
tried
to
get
pa
to
let
the
police
go
and
drive
them
off
but
he
said
he
had
no
time
to
go
and
wake
up
the
police
and
they
would
get
around
anyway
before
the
middle
of
the
week
so
pa
took
a
tent
stake
and
started
for
the
green
corn
roast
the
indians
were
taking
turns
dancing
and
eating
roasted
corn
and
they
had
a
barrel
of
beer
and
i
knew
enough
about
indians
to
keep
away
from
them
when
they
mix
beer
with
green
corn
for
it
has
about
the
same
effect
as
committing
suicide
with
carbolic
acid
pa
put
his
hat
on
one
side
of
his
head
and
went
right
into
the
midst
of
the
indians
and
grabbed
a
chief
called
one
ear
at
a
time
and
hit
him
with
the
tent
stake
and
knocked
him
down
and
said
now
you
git
well
sir
that
indian
had
no
more
than
struck
the
fire
in
a
sitting
position
and
filled
the
air
with
the
odor
of
fried
buckskin
before
the
whole
tribe
jumped
on
pa
and
they
kicked
him
with
their
moccasins
and
were
going
to
murder
him
while
the
chief
who
acted
as
the
burnt
offering
got
out
of
the
fire
and
sat
down
in
the
cold
mud
to
cool
himself
he
held
up
his
hand
as
a
signal
of
attention
and
he
called
a
council
of
war
while
the
squaws
sat
on
pa
to
hold
him
down
the
council
of
war
sentenced
pa
to
be
burned
at
the
stake
and
they
tied
him
to
a
tree
and
began
to
pile
sticks
around
him
and
pa
told
me
to
go
to
the
circus
lot
and
give
an
alarm
and
send
the
hands
to
rescue
him
gee
but
did
i
run
though
and
yell
an
alarm
big
enough
for
a
massacre
i
told
the
hands
who
were
sleeping
under
the
seats
or
playing
cards
on
the
trunks
that
the
indians
were
burning
pa
at
the
stake
and
some
of
the
hands
said
that
would
serve
him
right
and
the
fellows
that
were
playing
cards
said
they
did
want
to
break
up
the
game
when
they
were
losers
to
rescue
no
baldheaded
curmudgeon
i
thought
pa
was
a
goner
sure
i
could
hear
the
indians
yell
and
i
thought
i
could
smell
flesh
burning
oh
but
i
was
scared
for
fear
they
would
burn
pa
alive
illustration
the
indians
tied
pa
to
a
tree
and
began
to
pile
sticks
around
him
just
then
the
man
who
had
charge
of
our
cannibals
who
each
had
a
dog
that
they
were
looking
for
a
place
to
roast
came
along
and
i
told
him
about
the
indians
corn
roast
and
he
ordered
the
cannibals
to
go
drive
the
indians
away
from
their
fire
and
roast
their
dogs
well
it
worked
like
a
charm
and
the
cannibals
made
a
rush
for
the
indians
and
drove
them
away
just
as
they
had
lighted
the
fire
around
pa
and
we
were
not
a
minute
too
soon
after
the
indians
had
skedaddled
for
the
woods
and
we
cut
the
cords
that
bound
pa
the
cannibals
went
to
work
and
skun
the
dogs
and
began
to
cook
them
and
pa
looked
on
until
it
made
him
squirmish
but
he
was
so
tickled
at
being
saved
from
the
indians
that
he
tried
to
be
a
good
fellow
with
the
cannibals
i
guess
it
would
have
been
all
right
only
the
cannibals
got
to
drinking
the
philadelphia
beer
and
then
it
was
all
off
cause
roast
dog
was
good
enough
for
them
and
they
wanted
to
roast
first
they
offered
pa
dog
to
eat
but
he
had
swore
off
on
dog
and
passed
on
it
and
that
made
the
cannibals
mad
and
they
got
ready
to
roast
pa
and
i
guess
they
would
have
eaten
him
half
cooked
if
it
had
been
for
the
performers
and
freaks
who
had
missed
their
pet
dogs
and
the
circus
hands
told
them
the
cannibals
had
just
gone
to
the
woods
with
a
mess
of
dogs
to
roast
for
a
dog
feast
well
they
were
just
getting
a
fire
around
pa
and
he
was
giving
the
grand
hailing
sign
of
distress
when
the
performers
headed
by
the
fat
woman
whose
peeled
mexican
dog
was
lost
in
the
shuffle
came
in
amongst
the
cannibals
and
pa
and
the
other
dogs
were
rescued
in
the
darnedest
fight
i
ever
saw
the
performers
just
walked
right
over
the
cannibals
and
mauled
them
with
stakes
and
all
the
dogs
that
had
not
been
killed
were
pulled
away
from
the
heathen
and
saved
the
fat
woman
got
her
dog
all
right
and
when
pa
came
up
from
the
stake
where
they
were
going
to
burn
him
and
congratulated
her
on
recovering
her
dog
she
turned
on
pa
and
accused
him
of
being
the
leading
cannibal
and
that
he
was
the
one
who
put
up
the
whole
job
to
steal
the
dogs
she
jabbed
him
with
a
parasol
but
pa
was
innocent
illustration
the
fat
woman
jabbed
pa
with
her
parasol
the
indians
got
back
to
the
tent
along
towards
morning
and
the
cannibals
went
back
with
us
and
we
had
to
feed
them
on
wieners
which
was
the
nearest
to
roast
dog
we
could
get
for
them
at
that
time
of
night
pa
seems
to
get
it
in
the
neck
in
this
show
everything
that
goes
wrong
is
laid
to
him
and
if
anything
goes
right
somebody
else
gets
the
credit
and
i
think
he
would
resign
if
it
was
not
for
his
pride
after
the
trouble
about
the
indians
and
the
cannibals
the
manager
called
pa
up
and
reprimanded
him
for
indulging
the
tribes
in
their
wild
orgies
and
said
he
could
maintain
discipline
as
long
as
pa
mixed
up
with
them
and
encouraged
them
in
such
things
pa
tried
to
explain
that
he
was
the
victim
instead
of
being
the
cause
of
the
dog
roast
but
the
manager
dismissed
pa
by
telling
him
not
to
let
it
occur
again
then
to
show
the
inconsistency
of
the
manager
he
ordered
pa
to
go
on
ahead
of
the
show
to
new
york
and
advertise
that
the
cannibals
in
our
show
would
give
an
exhibition
of
roasting
and
eating
a
human
being
and
to
offer
a
reward
for
anybody
that
would
consent
to
be
roasted
and
eaten
in
public
pa
has
gone
to
new
york
to
look
for
somebody
who
will
take
the
position
of
meat
for
the
cannibals
and
he
is
instructed
to
spare
no
expense
to
find
such
a
man
he
thinks
he
may
find
somebody
connected
with
the
life
insurance
scandal
who
has
lost
all
desire
to
live
any
longer
and
who
will
gladly
go
into
this
mutual
scheme
i
do
know
this
circus
business
is
too
much
for
me
i
am
losing
friends
all
the
time
even
the
monkeys
have
got
so
they
seem
to
be
ashamed
to
be
seen
talking
to
me
and
when
i
pass
the
monkey
cage
they
turn
their
backs
on
me
as
though
i
did
not
belong
to
their
set
when
a
fellow
gets
so
low
that
monkeys
feel
above
him
and
throw
out
sarcastic
remarks
when
he
goes
by
it
is
time
to
change
your
luck
some
way
chapter
xiv
a
newport
monk
is
added
to
the
show
the
boy
teaches
him
some
manly
tricks
the
tent
blows
down
and
a
panic
follows
pa
manages
the
animal
act
which
ends
in
a
novel
manner
we
have
added
to
the
show
the
most
remarkable
animal
that
ever
was
a
baboon
that
dresses
like
a
man
and
eats
at
a
table
using
a
knife
and
fork
and
a
napkin
this
baboon
has
been
playing
an
engagement
with
the
four
hundred
at
newport
dining
with
the
crowned
heads
at
that
resort
but
the
confounded
baboon
got
to
be
too
human
and
he
fell
in
love
with
an
heiress
and
scared
one
of
the
willie
boys
that
was
also
in
love
with
her
his
friends
were
afraid
that
the
baboon
would
cut
willie
out
entirely
or
get
jealous
and
injure
willie
so
the
manager
of
the
four
hundred
show
decided
to
banish
the
baboon
and
our
show
sent
pa
to
newport
to
buy
the
baboon
and
bring
him
to
our
show
at
new
york
we
had
the
darndest
time
getting
him
away
from
newport
pa
could
do
any
with
him
but
he
took
to
me
he
thought
i
was
his
brother
and
i
could
do
anything
with
him
we
got
him
in
our
stateroom
on
the
boat
and
took
his
clothes
away
from
him
he
only
wears
his
clothes
when
he
is
being
dined
and
wined
and
we
chained
him
in
the
upper
berth
he
just
raised
the
very
deuce
on
the
way
down
to
new
york
after
pa
and
i
got
to
sleep
that
baboon
got
my
clothes
and
put
them
on
slipped
the
chain
over
his
head
jumped
through
the
transom
and
went
into
every
berth
where
the
transom
was
open
and
chatted
with
the
people
who
occupied
the
berths
there
was
an
old
man
and
woman
from
new
hampshire
in
one
berth
and
when
the
monk
got
in
their
berth
and
began
to
talk
the
newport
language
the
old
man
thought
it
was
me
and
he
said
now
bub
you
go
away
to
your
the
monk
went
out
and
got
into
another
berth
and
crawled
under
the
bunk
and
when
the
woman
came
in
to
go
to
bed
she
looked
under
it
to
see
if
any
man
was
there
when
she
saw
our
baboon
she
yelled
fire
and
the
officers
of
the
boat
pulled
him
out
by
the
hind
leg
and
tore
my
pant
leg
off
pa
and
i
had
to
sit
up
the
rest
of
the
night
with
him
and
when
we
landed
him
with
the
show
at
madison
square
garden
we
felt
relieved
illustration
when
she
saw
the
baboon
she
yelled
fire
one
woman
on
the
boat
has
followed
us
ever
since
to
collect
damages
from
pa
his
oldest
son
the
monk
proposed
to
her
gee
it
seems
to
me
a
woman
ought
to
know
the
difference
between
a
baboon
and
a
man
but
some
women
will
marry
anything
that
wears
clothes
the
monk
took
to
me
so
pa
said
i
must
teach
him
everything
i
could
that
men
do
so
i
thought
it
would
do
no
harm
to
teach
him
to
chew
tobacco
he
could
already
smoke
cigarettes
so
i
borrowed
a
chew
from
the
boss
canvasman
a
great
big
chew
of
black
plug
tobacco
and
the
monk
grabbed
it
and
chewed
it
awhile
just
before
the
afternoon
performance
and
swallowed
it
i
knew
that
settled
the
monk
and
when
the
audience
came
along
by
his
cage
and
pa
was
trying
to
get
him
to
perform
as
he
did
at
newport
eating
dinner
like
a
man
the
monk
turned
pale
and
his
stomach
ached
and
he
stood
on
his
head
and
held
his
stomach
in
both
hands
and
kicked
the
table
over
then
he
hit
pa
a
swat
with
his
foot
and
wound
his
tail
around
pa
neck
and
laid
his
head
on
pa
shirt
bosom
and
was
seasick
pa
said
well
this
beats
everything
what
did
you
do
to
him
i
told
pa
i
had
only
been
teaching
the
monk
manly
tricks
and
pa
said
well
you
have
overdone
it
and
then
the
humane
society
had
pa
arrested
for
cruelty
to
animals
but
the
monk
got
over
it
and
now
he
tries
to
be
a
masher
and
winks
at
women
and
flirts
with
them
just
as
the
men
do
at
newport
we
thought
we
were
smart
when
we
held
up
the
railroad
for
damages
back
in
pennsylvania
after
the
wreck
but
we
are
getting
a
dose
of
our
own
medicine
at
poughkeepsie
there
came
up
a
wind
and
rainstorm
that
blew
the
tent
down
right
in
the
midst
of
the
evening
performance
and
scared
everybody
half
to
death
several
people
were
hit
by
tent
poles
and
hurt
some
and
it
was
the
wildest
scene
i
ever
saw
and
people
who
got
out
alive
ran
away
in
the
dark
and
somebody
said
the
animals
had
all
got
loose
and
some
of
the
people
never
stopped
running
till
daylight
the
next
morning
some
run
into
the
river
and
the
ambulances
carried
the
injured
to
hospitals
pa
stampeded
with
the
elephants
and
never
showed
up
till
noon
the
next
day
by
that
time
at
least
people
had
filed
claims
for
damages
and
all
the
lawyers
from
albany
to
new
york
were
on
our
trail
the
managers
appointed
pa
to
settle
with
the
injured
and
the
way
he
argued
with
those
people
was
a
caution
one
old
woman
was
killed
and
pa
tried
to
show
her
relatives
that
as
she
was
old
and
helpless
and
more
or
less
a
burden
to
the
family
they
ought
to
pay
the
show
something
for
getting
her
off
their
hands
one
tramp
had
his
feet
cut
off
and
pa
tried
to
show
him
how
much
he
would
save
in
shoes
the
rest
of
his
life
and
that
he
was
in
big
luck
we
left
pa
at
poughkeepsie
to
settle
the
cases
and
went
on
to
new
york
and
we
heard
the
people
had
lynched
him
but
he
showed
up
in
a
couple
of
days
with
money
left
now
all
the
lawyers
in
new
york
are
after
us
with
claims
and
they
have
attached
most
everything
and
the
show
is
up
against
it
what
a
difference
it
makes
who
wants
damages
when
we
were
working
the
railroad
for
damages
it
was
a
cinch
and
like
getting
money
from
home
but
now
that
the
people
are
working
us
for
damages
for
being
smashed
up
under
our
tent
we
look
upon
it
as
a
crime
and
tell
them
it
is
an
act
of
providence
and
that
the
show
is
not
to
blame
for
a
windstorm
but
the
lawyers
ca
be
very
pious
for
they
wo
believe
in
the
act
of
providence
racket
and
we
shall
have
to
cough
up
all
the
profits
of
the
season
since
we
got
settled
in
new
york
for
a
two
weeks
stand
in
madison
square
garden
we
are
having
the
tents
repaired
and
do
have
to
put
up
and
take
down
tents
and
ride
all
night
on
trains
we
are
all
stopping
at
hotels
and
getting
rested
and
pa
is
having
a
chance
to
shine
the
managers
think
pa
is
trying
to
commit
suicide
for
he
wants
to
take
the
place
of
anybody
who
is
sick
or
drunk
and
is
the
understudy
of
everybody
we
got
one
act
that
just
curdles
your
blood
a
cage
in
the
ring
with
lions
and
tigers
and
leopards
who
go
through
all
kinds
of
stunts
one
lion
rides
a
horse
and
jumps
through
hoops
and
lands
on
the
back
of
the
horse
and
jumps
on
a
staging
and
lets
the
horse
go
around
the
ring
and
then
jumps
on
again
the
horse
is
blindfolded
so
he
know
it
is
a
lion
that
jumps
on
his
back
but
thinks
it
is
a
man
the
tigers
ride
bicycles
and
the
leopards
jump
about
wherever
the
trainer
tells
them
to
a
monkey
acts
as
clown
and
a
little
elephant
runs
a
automobile
that
act
alone
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
well
the
regular
trainer
went
to
coney
island
and
got
drunk
and
we
either
had
to
cut
out
that
performance
or
give
back
the
money
and
the
manager
was
wailing
about
it
nothing
makes
a
circus
man
wail
like
giving
back
good
money
then
pa
said
he
would
save
the
day
by
taking
charge
of
the
animal
act
he
said
he
had
watched
it
every
day
and
knew
how
to
do
it
and
he
could
dress
up
in
the
clothes
of
the
regular
trainer
and
the
animals
would
know
the
difference
gee
but
i
was
scared
to
have
pa
try
to
run
that
animal
show
and
i
think
everyone
in
the
show
believed
it
would
be
pa
finish
i
felt
like
an
orphan
when
pa
came
out
of
the
with
the
trainer
clothes
on
though
pa
stomach
was
so
big
you
would
think
a
blindfolded
horse
would
know
pa
was
no
trainer
well
pa
went
in
the
round
cage
made
of
bar
iron
and
motioned
to
the
attendants
to
send
the
animals
into
the
cage
through
the
chute
from
the
animal
quarters
the
first
to
come
were
two
tigers
that
were
to
ride
velocipedes
i
trembled
for
pa
when
they
went
in
and
waved
their
tails
and
looked
at
pa
as
much
as
to
say
o
we
wo
do
a
thing
to
you
they
actually
looked
at
each
other
and
winked
but
pa
motioned
to
the
velocipedes
and
looked
fierce
and
when
they
hesitated
about
getting
on
pa
said
you
wo
wo
you
and
he
took
a
club
filled
with
lead
and
started
for
the
biggest
tiger
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
he
jumped
on
the
machine
and
the
other
followed
and
they
raced
around
and
then
pa
made
them
get
off
and
jump
hurdles
finally
he
motioned
to
a
shelf
for
them
to
jump
up
onto
and
when
they
hesitated
he
kicked
one
in
the
slats
and
hit
the
other
with
the
club
and
they
went
up
on
that
shelf
too
quick
but
they
stayed
there
and
snarled
at
pa
and
i
was
afraid
they
would
jump
on
him
when
his
back
was
turned
then
they
brought
in
the
blind
horse
and
the
lion
and
the
lion
was
onto
pa
and
he
struck
right
off
he
got
up
on
the
pedestal
from
which
he
was
to
jump
onto
the
horse
back
but
when
the
horse
came
around
the
lion
would
jump
and
pa
said
i
give
you
one
more
chance
and
the
horse
went
under
the
lion
and
he
would
jump
so
pa
stopped
the
horse
and
took
an
iron
bar
and
knocked
the
lion
off
onto
the
floor
and
he
growled
at
pa
but
pa
kept
mauling
him
and
finally
the
lion
jumped
up
on
the
pedestal
and
seemed
to
say
bring
on
your
horse
and
pa
started
the
horse
and
mr
lion
made
his
jumps
all
right
and
the
audience
cheered
illustration
pa
kept
mauling
the
lion
all
the
animals
went
through
their
stunts
all
right
but
i
thought
i
could
see
they
were
laying
for
pa
and
i
wished
he
was
out
of
the
cage
the
came
when
the
lions
were
seated
on
benches
and
the
elephant
was
between
them
and
the
tigers
and
leopards
made
a
pyramid
and
the
monkey
was
clawing
around
pa
legs
the
signal
was
about
to
be
given
for
the
animals
to
return
through
the
chute
when
the
monkey
tackled
pa
legs
like
a
football
player
the
elephant
pushed
pa
over
and
the
lions
pawed
him
and
snarled
and
the
tigers
took
a
mouthful
out
of
pants
and
the
leopards
snatched
his
red
coat
off
and
the
signal
was
given
for
them
to
get
out
of
the
cage
and
they
went
out
like
boys
at
recess
leaving
pa
in
the
cage
with
the
blind
horse
with
not
clothes
enough
left
on
him
to
wad
a
gun
he
was
not
even
scratched
however
the
animals
having
just
combined
to
humiliate
pa
the
audience
cheered
pa
said
well
would
that
skin
you
they
threw
him
an
overcoat
to
put
on
and
he
bowed
like
a
hero
and
quit
the
ring
cage
and
was
met
outside
by
the
whole
show
management
and
congratulated
on
having
more
nerve
than
any
man
alive
pa
said
if
you
will
give
me
a
shotgun
loaded
with
bird
shot
i
will
make
those
animals
get
on
their
knees
at
the
next
performance
and
beg
my
pardon
you
can
discharge
your
trainer
and
i
will
teach
them
a
lot
of
new
stunts
say
pa
is
a
wonder

has
already

the
manager
of
the
show
was
talking
to
pa
and
me
before
we
left
new
york
about
the
condition
of
the
show
its
finances
were
all
balled
up
on
account
of
settling
with
people
who
pretended
to
be
injured
when
the
tent
blew
down
at
poughkeepsie
and
the
hands
and
performers
are
kicking
because
we
are
a
month
behind
on
salaries
and
they
get
drunk
whenever
any
jay
will
buy
for
them
everybody
gives
passes
to
everybody
that
wants
to
get
in
the

so
the
box
office
man
has
a
sinecure
and
people
chase
us
from
town
to
town
for
money
for
board
and
hay
and
everything
all
through
new
jersey
we
showed
to
claim
agents
and
creditors
and
did
take
in
money
enough
to
buy
meat
for
the
animals
he
said
the
animals
had
all
taken
cold
and
lay
around
dormant
and
did
take
any
interest
in
the
business
and
the
manager
told
pa
he
must
think
of
something
to
wake
the
animals
up
pa
said
he
would
leave
it
to
me
to
wake
up
and
get
some
ginger
into
them
i
told
pa
if
i
had
five
dollars
to
spend
i
could
make
every
animal
jump
like
a
box
car
pa
gave
me
the
money
and
i
went
and
bought
five
pounds
of
scotchsnuff
and
divided
it
up
into
ounce
packages
and
started
during
the
afternoon
performance
at
wilmington
to
wake
up
the
animals
there
is
something
peculiar
about
animals
if
you
try
to
give
them
anything
that
they
think
you
want
them
to
take
you
ca
drive
it
down
them
with
a
pile
driver
but
if
you
try
to
hide
something
where
they
can
reach
it
they
watch
you
out
of
one
eye
and
when
you
go
away
they
look
at
you
as
much
as
to
say
o
you
think
you
are
smart
do
you
then
they
will
go
and
dig
it
up
and
play
with
it
and
eat
it
if
they
want
to
i
took
my
first
package
of
snuff
to
the
lion
cage
and
he
was
the
sickest
and
most
disgusted
looking
lion
you
ever
saw
acting
like
a
man
who
has
taken
a
severe
cold
and
wants
to
kill
anybody
that
looks
at
him
the
lion
lay
on
the
straw
stretched
out
full
length
paying
no
attention
to
the
crowd
that
passed
his
cage
and
acting
as
though
he
wanted
a
hot
whisky
and
his
feet
soaked
in
mustard
water
when
he
was
not
looking
i
hid
the
package
of
snuff
under
the
straw
and
rattled
the
straw
a
little
and
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
you
ca
fool
old
shadrack
for
i
am
onto
you
i
walked
away
behind
the
hyena
cage
and
mr
lion
got
up
and
stretched
himself
and
walked
to
the
place
where
i
put
the
paper
of
snuff
put
his
foot
on
it
and
broke
the
paper
and
then
he
put
his
nose
down
and
sniffed
a
sniff
that
drew
the
whole
of
the
snuff
up
into
his
nose
and
lungs
and
insides
generally
gee
but
you
never
saw
such
a
change
in
a
lion
the
crowd
of
visitors
were
right
near
his
cage
when
he
sniffed
and
when
he
got
the
snuff
into
him
he
began
to
heave
his
sides
like
a
man
who
is
preparing
to
sneeze
caught
his
breath
a
few
times
and
let
out
a
sneeze
that
sounded
like
the
explosion
of
an
automobile
tire
it
threw
cut
feed
all
over
the
audience
and
everybody
ran
away
yelling
that
the
lion
busted
he
kept
on
sneezing
and
looking
so
astounded
as
though
he
make
out
what
had
got
into
him
pa
heard
the
commotion
and
came
running
up
to
the
cage
to
find
out
what
ailed
the
lion
after
i
had
gone
around
to
the
other
cages
and
put
snuff
in
all
of
them
i
came
up
to
the
cage
the
lion
had
stopped
sneezing
and
was
roaring
and
jumping
up
and
down
with
his
mouth
open
trying
to
catch
his
breath
like
a
man
who
has
taken
too
big
a
dose
of
fresh
pa
said
what
have
you
been
doing
to
shadrack
i
told
pa
i
had
woke
shadrack
up
and
that
in
about
a
minute
he
would
find
that
the
whole
animal
kingdom
had
got
a
bellyful
and
would
join
in
the
chorus
pa
tried
to
soothe
the
lion
by
going
up
to
the
cage
and
stroking
his
mane
but
the
lion
looked
and
stopped
prancing
and
gave
a
sneeze
right
at
pa
which
blew
pa
clear
across
the
tent
to
where
the
sacred
cow
had
just
got
hers
when
the
stuff
began
to
work
on
that
cow
it
was
simply
scandalous
she
bellowed
and
cried
and
sneezed
all
at
once
and
pawed
pa
he
got
up
and
told
me
i
was
overdoing
this
waking
up
act
on
the
animals
by
that
time
the
cage
of
hyenas
began
to
sneeze
a
quartette
and
fight
each
other
and
the
atmosphere
about
their
cage
was
full
of
hair
and
language
that
would
be
much
like
cussing
if
it
could
be
translated
into
english
pa
tried
to
quiet
the
crowd
and
silence
the
hyenas
by
taking
an
iron
bar
and
mauling
them
but
the
hyenas
just
backed
up
against
the
rear
of
the
cage
and
howled
and
sneezed
at
pa
and
dared
him
to
come
on
illustration
the
lion
sneezed
and
blew
pa
clear
across
the
tent
one
of
them
caught
him
by
the
shirt
sleeve
and
tore
pa
shirt
off
and
eat
it
pa
was
a
sight
with
no
shirt
on
and
he
ought
to
have
gone
to
the
dressing
room
and
slicked
but
just
then
the
camels
and
the
giraffes
who
had
inhaled
their
snuff
began
to
sneeze
and
beg
to
be
killed
and
pa
had
to
go
over
there
and
quiet
them
a
camel
is
the
solemnist
looking
beast
on
earth
when
he
tries
to
be
good
natured
but
when
he
is
sick
and
mad
and
full
of
snuff
he
is
a
fiend
one
such
camel
is
enough
for
a
man
to
handle
but
when
camels
are
all
sneezing
at
once
and
trying
to
locate
the
person
that
is
responsible
for
their
trouble
it
is
the
safest
to
keep
away
and
when
pa
went
in
amongst
them
with
no
shirt
on
and
the
arab
keepers
had
run
away
in
fright
it
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
but
pa
is
brave
even
to
rashness
he
went
up
to
mahomet
the
leader
of
the
herd
who
was
the
leader
of
the
sneezers
and
kicked
him
in
the
slats
and
told
him
to
hush
up
his
noise
he
clubbed
him
on
the
humps
with
a
tent
stake
then
there
was
a
rebellion
in
egypt
and
mahomet
bit
pa
and
would
let
go
and
the
other
camels
sneezed
all
over
pa
and
had
him
down
walking
on
him
with
their
padded
feet
the
circus
hands
had
to
pull
pa
out
and
it
was
so
bad
because
the
crowd
remained
and
they
thought
it
was
a
part
of
the
show
and
that
the
animals
were
trained
to
sneeze
that
way
the
worst
case
was
the
hippopotamus
he
was
so
big
and
had
such
big
nostrils
that
i
laid
about
half
a
pound
of
snuff
on
the
side
of
his
tank
and
when
he
snuffed
it
up
his
nose
he
got
it
all
i
heard
a
howl
from
the
tank
and
the
herd
who
was
the
leader
of
the
sneezers
and
i
told
pa
to
come
on
vessuvious
was
going
to
erupt
pa
came
on
the
run
just
as
he
was
and
then
the
worst
happened
i
think
the
hippo
went
under
water
when
he
found
the
sneeze
was
coming
for
just
as
pa
got
to
the
tank
the
water
flew
into
the
air
like
a
torpedo
had
exploded
under
a
and
the
hippo
had
sneezed
all
right
and
pa
and
the
audience
which
had
followed
him
were
drenched
and
deafened
by
the
explosion
the
hippo
had
blown
the
water
all
out
of
his
tank
and
he
lay
at
the
bottom
on
his
side
sneezing
little
sneezes
not
louder
than
the
report
of
a
cannon
and
panting
for
breath
then
he
raised
his
head
got
up
on
his
feet
and
opened
his
mouth
like
a
gash
cut
in
a
steer
by
a
cow
catcher
of
an
engine
and
he
yawned
and
i
guess
he
got
the
lockjaw
he
kept
his
mouth
open
all
the
afternoon
to
get
the
air
like
a
soprano
singer
in
a
choir
who
has
been
fed
a
cayenne
pepper
lozenger
by
the
tenor
just
before
she
gets
up
to
sing
a
charge
to
keep
i
have
we
went
around
and
inspected
the
sneezing
animals
with
the
manager
and
he
complimented
me
by
saying
i
had
saved
the
show
from
becoming
an
aggregation
of
stuffed
animals
only
fit
for
a
taxidermist
studio
and
made
every
animal
show
that
he
had
ginger
in
him
he
wanted
me
to
try
my
snuff
cure
on
the
performers
and
freaks
they
were
getting
to
be
dead
ones
well
before
the
day
was
over
at
wilmington
pa
was
scared
worse
than
he
ever
was
in
all
his
life
before
the
state
of
delaware
is
the
only
state
that
punishes
criminals
by
tying
them
up
and
whipping
them
on
the
bare
back
with
a
and
all
our
men
had
been
warned
to
be
good
while
they
were
in
delaware
if
they
committed
any
crime
there
was
no
power
on
earth
that
could
save
them
from
being
publicly
horsewhipped
pa
himself
impressed
it
on
the
men
to
look
out
that
they
did
get
into
any
trouble
gee
but
the
fear
of
a
public
whipping
makes
men
good
twenty
years
ago
some
men
from
new
york
robbed
a
bank
in
delaware
and
were
caught
and
given
lashes
apiece
on
the
bare
back
by
a
big
negro
and
there
has
never
been
a
burglary
in
delaware
since
we
thought
we
would
play
a
joke
on
pa
so
the
manager
told
pa
that
constables
were
looking
for
him
to
arrest
him
for
cruelty
to
animals
for
kicking
a
camel
in
the
stomach
and
hitting
the
camel
with
an
iron
bar
and
that
if
pa
did
want
to
be
publicly
horsewhipped
on
the
bare
back
he
better
skip
out
for
washington
where
we
would
show
in
a
couple
of
days
and
wait
for
us
pa
was
so
frightened
he
could
get
supper
and
everybody
talked
about
cats
of
nine
tails
and
how
prisoners
were
cut
to
pieces
and
every
time
pa
saw
a
jay
with
a
slouch
hat
he
thought
it
was
a
constable
after
him
after
dark
he
put
on
an
old
suit
of
clothes
and
said
he
was
going
to
washington
they
told
him
if
he
went
to
take
a
train
he
would
surely
be
arrested
at
the
depot
so
pa
put
a
saddle
on
one
of
the
mules
and
rode
out
of
town
and
rode
all
night
and
all
the
next
day
he
bought
oats
of
farmers
to
be
delivered
at
wilmington
for
the
circus
finally
he
got
out
of
delaware
and
the
next
day
the
farmers
came
in
with
the
oats
but
the
show
was
gone
and
they
wo
do
a
thing
to
pa
if
he
ever
shows
up
in
delaware
again
illustration
pa
rode
out
of
town
and
rode
all
night
pa
met
us
at
the
depot
in
washington
but
he
was
ever
so
changed
from
his
long
ride
and
anxiety
over
the
possibility
of
being
arrested
and
pilloried
and
lambasted
by
a
negro
in
delaware
he
said
to
me
with
a
trembling
voice
hennery
this
show
business
is
too
much
for
your
pa
i
would
rather
be
a
mormon
in
utah
with
wives
and
several
hundred
children
and
long
whiskers
i
am
a
changed
man
hennery
and
afraid
of
my
shadow
chapter
xvi
a
senator
son
bets
the
bad
boy
that
elephants
are
cowards
they
let
a
bag
of
rats
loose
at
the
afternoon
performance
the
elephants
stampede
pa
fractures
a
rib
and
general
pandemonium
reigns
gee
but
i
must
be
an
easy
mark
i
have
got
so
i
bet
on
a
sure
thing
and
when
a
fellow
bets
on
a
sure
thing
he
is
bound
to
lose
it
was
this
way
the
show
arrived
in
washington
on
a
sunday
morning
and
as
usual
all
the
boys
in
town
came
to
the
lot
to
see
us
put
up
the
tents
i
was
around
with
pa
and
the
boss
canvasman
and
the
town
boys
could
see
i
belonged
to
the
show
and
they
envied
me
and
wanted
to
get
acquainted
with
me
so
i
would
let
them
walk
around
with
me
and
go
into
the
tents
sunday
afternoon
and
see
the
animals
there
was
one
boy
with
a
sort
of
rough
rider
hat
on
and
buckskin
fringe
on
his
pants
and
everybody
said
he
was
a
senator
son
but
the
other
boys
had
rather
be
acquainted
with
me
because
i
belonged
to
the
show
and
i
took
pity
on
the
senator
son
and
let
him
talk
to
me
without
looking
cross
at
him
or
snubbing
him
as
i
do
most
boys
who
try
to
butt
in
on
me
i
got
to
liking
the
senator
son
and
had
him
come
in
the
tent
and
we
put
in
the
afternoon
looking
at
the
animals
the
elephants
were
chewing
hay
and
looking
fierce
and
the
senator
boy
said
elephants
were
the
greatest
cowards
on
earth
and
i
said
not
on
your
life
the
giant
in
our
show
is
the
greatest
coward
and
the
behemoth
of
holy
writ
is
next
the
senator
son
said
elephants
were
such
cowards
they
were
afraid
of
mice
and
we
could
take
a
trap
full
of
mice
and
turn
them
loose
in
the
ring
and
the
elephants
would
stampede
and
he
would
bet
five
dollars
on
it
i
excused
myself
for
a
moment
and
told
pa
what
the
senator
son
offered
to
bet
and
pa
said
here
and
you
can
take
all
the
bets
you
can
get
why
this
herd
of
elephants
would
walk
on
mice
and
rats
too
you
bet
with
him
and
tell
him
to
bring
along
all
the
rats
and
mice
he
can
find
in
the
white
house
and
you
can
turn
them
into
the
ring
monday
afternoon
when
the
elephants
do
their
turn
and
if
an
elephant
bats
an
eye
i
will
eat
his
ears
for
mushrooms
i
went
back
to
young
mr
senator
and
took
his
bet
and
told
him
i
had
plenty
more
money
to
bet
the
same
way
and
he
said
the
next
afternoon
he
would
come
with
his
mice
and
rats
and
a
lot
of
money
to
bet
that
you
could
hold
that
flock
of
elephants
with
log
chains
when
he
opened
his
bag
of
rats
and
mice
well
how
it
got
into
the
papers
i
do
not
know
but
the
next
morning
they
all
said
an
interesting
experiment
would
be
made
the
next
afternoon
at
the
great
and
only
circus
to
determine
once
and
for
all
whether
elephants
were
afraid
of
mice
and
that
a
senator
son
and
a
son
of
one
of
the
proprietors
of
the
show
would
conduct
the
experiment
by
turning
loose
a
lot
of
mice
and
rats
in
the
rings
at
precisely
well
you
never
saw
such
a
crowd
in
a
circus
as
we
had
that
afternoon
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
population
turned
out
foreign
ministers
negroes
society
people
and
clerks
that
senator
son
and
the
whole
family
and
the
neighbors
must
have
been
up
all
night
catching
mice
and
rats
and
it
took
nine
boys
and
three
servants
to
carry
the
baskets
and
traps
and
bags
of
mice
and
rats
i
passed
them
all
in
and
we
lined
up
on
a
front
seat
to
wait
for
the
elephant
stunt
and
when
the
thing
was
ripe
we
were
to
empty
the
whole
mess
of
vermin
into
the
ring
i
felt
as
though
something
was
wrong
i
saw
the
new
moon
over
my
left
shoulder
the
night
before
and
now
i
wish
i
had
died
before
this
thing
happened
when
the
japanese
jugglers
went
out
of
the
ring
i
knew
that
was
the
cue
for
the
elephants
to
come
in
and
when
the
dressing
room
curtain
was
pulled
aside
and
old
bolivar
came
out
at
the
head
of
the
herd
and
they
marched
around
the
outside
of
the
ring
clear
around
the
tent
my
heart
jumped
up
into
my
throat
and
i
felt
sick
the
senator
son
said
when
these
rats
and
things
begin
to
chase
your
old
elephants
you
wo
be
able
to
see
their
tails
for
the
dust
they
will
kick
up
then
i
thought
of
the
money
pa
had
given
me
to
bet
and
i
offered
to
bet
it
all
and
a
negro
produced
funds
and
took
all
my
bets
like
a
bookmaker
well
after
doing
a
turn
around
the
big
ring
the
trainer
steered
the
elephants
into
the
middle
ring
and
the
great
audience
leaned
forward
to
catch
every
trick
the
elephants
did
us
boys
held
on
to
the
bags
that
the
mice
and
things
were
in
waiting
for
our
cue
the
elephants
stood
on
their
heads
and
hind
feet
and
fore
feet
laid
down
fired
pistols
and
did
everything
just
right
without
making
a
mistake
finally
the
trainer
formed
the
whole
herd
into
a
grand
pyramid
with
old
bolivar
in
the
center
each
elephant
holding
an
american
flag
with
his
trunk
and
waving
it
and
the
audience
broke
out
into
a
cheer
that
fairly
ripped
the
canvas
then
i
said
to
young
mr
senator
come
on
with
your
rats
now
and
i
win
all
hands
picked
up
the
baskets
and
bags
and
went
to
the
side
of
the
ring
and
emptied
the
whole
bunch
of
more
than
into
the
ring
the
rats
and
mice
rushed
for
the
elephants
and
then
turned
and
made
a
rush
for
the
reserved
seats
oh
dear
what
a
time
we
had
the
elephants
got
down
off
that
pyramid
so
quick
it
would
make
your
head
swim
and
old
bolivar
trumpeted
in
abject
fear
and
tried
to
break
away
but
pa
came
along
with
a
tent
stake
and
hit
bolivar
over
the
head
and
told
the
trainer
to
put
the
elephants
back
into
the
pyramid
and
hold
them
there
till
the
bell
rung
for
them
to
cease
their
stunt
the
trainer
could
do
anything
with
them
and
they
bellowed
and
dodged
mice
and
shied
at
rats
and
bolivar
took
his
trunk
and
swatted
pa
clear
across
the
ring

bolivar
swatted

clear
across

the
elephants
followed
bolivar
to
the
main
entrance
each
elephant
trying
to
walk
on
the
heels
of
the
one
ahead
of
him
and
all
the
circus
hands
trying
to
head
off
the
elephants
but
they
would
head
off
they
were
simply
scared
to
death
and
they
broke
out
the
side
of
the
tent
near
the
lemonade
stand
and
went
whooping
out
into
the
open
air
and
freedom
while
the
audience
yelled
with
joy
young
mr
senator
said
to
me
what
do
you
think
of
elephants
now
i
told
him
to
take
his
money
and
he
darned
the
audience
was
getting
nervous
so
the
band
struck
up
a
hot
time
in
the
old
town
and
they
were
quieting
down
as
the
curtain
raised
and
the
horses
for
the
chariot
race
came
out
just
then
a
woman
with
red
socks
got
up
on
her
chair
in
the
press
seats
and
pulled
her
dress
away
up
and
yelled
rats
and
another
woman
screamed
and
jumped
up
on
a
seat
with
her
clothes
at
half
mast
and
yelled
that
there
were
mice
on
the
seats
in
less
than
two
minutes
every
woman
in
the
audience
and
the
bearded
woman
and
the
fat
woman
were
standing
up
on
something
holding
up
their
dresses
and
shaking
their
skirts
and
screaming
and
when
the
fat
woman
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
bearded
woman
in
a
faint
and
the
bearded
woman
dropped
the
fat
woman
pa
told
the
bearded
woman
he
was
ashamed
of
her
screaming
she
ought
to
be
more
of
a
man
than
that
well
every
mouse
and
rat
in
the
bunch
seemed
to
be
looking
for
women
to
scream
at
them
and
there
was
no
use
trying
to
run
a
show
with
such
an
excited
audience
so
pa
had
the
band
play
good
night
ladies
and
he
announced
that
the
performance
might
be
considered
over
for
the
afternoon
everybody
made
a
rush
for
the
exits
each
woman
held
up
her
skirts
and
fairly
galloped
to
get
away
from
the
mice
and
rats
they
all
got
out
of
the
tent
finally
and
then
the
managers
had
a
meeting
to
find
out
who
started
the
trouble
and
what
it
was
best
to
do
about
it
i
was
sitting
alone
on
a
front
seat
thinking
over
the
scenes
of
the
afternoon
and
wondering
what
the
young
senator
son
would
do
with
the
money
he
had
won
of
me
and
whether
he
had
depopulated
the
white
house
of
rats
and
mice
so
the
president
would
notice
it
i
was
thinking
about
elephants
and
wondering
if
they
were
cowards
by
nature
or
had
acquired
cowardice
by
associating
with
mankind
when
pa
came
along
and
sat
down
by
me
a
picture
of
despair
bolivar
had
fractured
one
of
his
ribs
and
the
fat
woman
had
paralyzed
his
knees
sitting
on
his
lap
while
they
brought
her
to
after
she
fainted
when
she
thought
a
rat
was
climbing
into
her
sock
pa
sighed
and
said
hennery
i
wanted
an
exciting
life
to
keep
me
from
brooding
over
advancing
age
and
i
chose
the
circus
business
but
i
find
it
is
rather
too
strenuous
for
me
each
day
something
occurs
to
try
my
nerves
i
do
not
claim
that
you
are
to
blame
for
it
all
but
i
think
i
could
enjoy
my
position
with
the
show
if
you
would
take
the
first
train
that
goes
north
and
leave
me
for
awhile
what
i
need
is
rest
go
boy
go
i
felt
sorry
far
pa
but
i
put
my
arm
around
him
and
i
said
pa
do
not
fear
i
will
never
desert
you
until
the
season
is
over
wherever
you
go
i
will
go
and
i
will
keep
you
awake
do
fear
now
that
we
are
going
into
the
sunny
south
where
every
man
may
have
it
in
for
you
you
were
a
yankee
soldier
i
will
stay
by
you
and
there
will
be
things
doing
that
will
make
you
think
the
past
has
been
a
sweet
dream
see
pa
illustration
pa
do
not
fear
pa
sighed
again
and
said
this
is
too
much
and
he
rushed
off
to
find

elephants

and
i
turned
the

loose

were

pa
and
all
the

had
to
go
away
down
towards

to
round
them

young

let
me
ride
one

he
and
i
went
along
to
help
catch
the
elephants
we
went
out
through
alexandria
towards
bull

battlefield
there
we
overtook
pa
and
the
boss
canvasman
and
the
elephant
handler
and
we
met
some
farmers
coming
into
alexandria
with
their
families
stampeding
like
people
out
west
when
the
indians
go
on
the
warpath
they
had
got
up
in
the
morning
to
milk
the
cows
and
found
about
elephants
in
the
barnyard
making
the
cows
do
a
song
and
dance
pa
told
them
there
was
no
danger
at
all
he
would
take
any
elephant
by
the
tail
and
snap
its
head
off
like
boys
snap
the
heads
off
garter
snakes
and
i
told
them
that
me
and
the
senator
boy
stampeded
the
elephants
and
we
could
drive
them
back
to
town
like
a
drove
of
sheep
illustration
we
met
some
farmers
the
farmers
thought
we
were
great
and
they
followed
us
back
to
the
farm
where
we
found
the
herd
of
elephants
had
taken
possession
and
were
having
the
time
of
their
lives
about
a
dozen
of
the
big
elephants
had
found
a
couple
of
barrels
of
cider
in
a
shed
and
had
been
drinking
it
and
when
we
got
there
they
were
like
section
hands
with
jags
on
bolivar
the
big
elephant
was
the
drunkest
and
when
he
saw
pa
coming
with
the
gang
of
hands
with
ropes
and
spears
he
winked
at
the
other
elephants
and
seemed
to
say
watch
me
tree
for
he
came
out
of
the
gate
and
bellowed
and
made
a
charge
at
the
gang
and
pa
beat
them
all
going
up
crab
apple
trees
the
senator
son
saw
pa
up
a
tree
and
he
said
old
gentleman
if
these
are
your
animals
or
insects
or
whatever
they
are
you
ought
to
come
down
off
your
perch
and
take
them
to
a
keeley
cure
because
they
are
intoxicated
illustration
old
gentleman
you
ought
to
come
down
off
your
perch
and
pa
came
down
and
took
a
fence
rail
and
sharpened
it
with
an
ax
and
he
run
it
into
bolivar
about
a
foot
and
bolivar
trumpeted
for
surrender
and
that
settled
the
elephant
strike
for
pa
ordered
bolivar
into
the
road
and
in
five
minutes
the
whole
herd
of
elephants
was
following
bolivar
back
to
washington
as
meek
as
a
drunken
husband
being
led
home
by
his
wife
gee
what
do
you
think
the
president
heard
how
the
senator
boy
and
i
stampeded
the
elephants
and
invited
the
senator
boy
to
bring
his
young
friend
around
to
the
white
house
to
supper
well
we
went
i
forgot
what
we
had
to
eat
i
was
so
interested
in
the
conversation
he
talked
about
the
show
business
as
though
he
had
been
a
ringmaster
in
a
circus
he
said
he
was
in
the
show
the
day
before
when
we
stampeded
the
elephants
and
he
told
us
about
his
hunting
trips
in
the
west
until
i
could
smell
bacon
cooking
at
the
camp
fire
and
i
could
smell
the
balsam
boughs
they
slept
on
on
the
ground
when
he
let
up
a
little
on
his
talk
i
braced
up
and
asked
him
if
he
had
rather
shoot
wild
cats
and
bears
than
be
president
he
hedged
and
said
both
occupations
worked
pretty
well
together
and
he
had
enjoyed
both
then
i
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
run
for
president
again
and
he
winked
at
his
wife
and
then
he
asked
me
what
made
me
ask
the
question
i
told
him
pa
wanted
me
to
find
out
i
told
him
all
the
boys
wanted
him
to
run
he
was
a
good
feller
and
not
afraid
of
the
cars
the
president
laughed
and
said
well
it
this
way
the
president
business
is
a
good
deal
like
bear
hunting
you
get
on
a
fresh
track
either
in
politics
or
bear
hunting
and
follow
the
game
with
dogs
or
politicians
as
the
case
may
be
the
trail
keeps
getting
fresher
and
by
and
by
the
game
is
in
sight
and
the
dogs
are
nipping
its
hind
legs
if
it
is
a
bear
or
chewing
big
words
if
it
is
an
opposing
candidate
and
nipping
him
in
exposed
places
you
ride
like
mad
your
clothes
or
your
reputation
torn
by
briars
if
it
is
a
bear
or
by
opposition
newspapers
if
it
is
a
political
campaign
and
you
wish
it
was
over
many
times
and
are
so
tired
you
wish
you
were
dead
finally
your
bear
or
your
opponent
in
politics
is
treed
and
the
dogs
are
trying
to
climb
the
tree
and
your
bear
or
your
political
opponent
is
up
on
a
limb
snarling
and
showing
his
teeth
at
the
dogs
or
the
politicians
and
then
you
ride
up
look
the
ground
over
wait
till
your
heart
stops
beating
and
fire
the
shot
at
a
vital
part
and
your
bear
or
your
political
opponent
comes
tumbling
to
the
ground
when
he
ceases
to
kick
you
put
your
foot
on
his
neck
and
feel
sorry
you
killed
him
but
you
go
to
work
and
skin
him
and
hang
his
hide
on
the
fence
then
you
have
got
to
ride
all
night
to
get
to
camp
if
it
is
a
bear
and
work
harder
than
a
man
on
a
treadmill
for
four
years
if
it
is
a
presidential
candidate
you
have
skun
i
had
sat
with
my
mouth
open
while
the
president
talked
and
never
said
a
word
but
when
he
quit
i
said
yes
but
suppose
when
you
got
your
bear
skun
another
bear
should
come
after
you
and
dare
you
to
knock
a
chip
off
his
shoulder
and
growl
and
walk
sideways
with
his
bristles
all
up
would
you
run
or
would
you
stand
your
ground
we
better
change
the
subject
said
the
president
and
rose
from
the
table
and
we
all
got
up
he
patted
me
on
the
head
and
said
tell
your
pa
i
will
see
him
later
and
in
the
meantime
you
run
your
circus
and
i
will
try
to
run
mine
the
queerest
thing
happened
that
night
the
senator
boy
spoke
of
our
trained
seals
that
catch
a
fish
if
you
throw
it
to
them
and
swallow
it
whole
he
said
it
would
be
fun
to
take
a
little
alarm
clock
and
sew
it
up
in
a
fish
and
set
the
alarm
at
seven
when
the
crowd
is
watching
the
seals
swallow
fish
and
throw
it
to
the
big
seal
and
the
alarm
would
go
off
inside
him
well
i
bit
like
a
bass
and
said
we
would
do
it
so
he
took
a
little
alarm
clock
and
set
it
for
seven
we
got
it
into
a
fish
and
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
what
happened
gee
but
that
seal
grabbed
the
fish
with
a
clock
in
it
and
tried
to
swallow
it
but
the
brass
ring
caught
on
one
of
his
teeth
and
he
was
trying
to
get
it
loose
when
the
alarm
went
off
and
the
seal
jumped
out
of
the
tank
and
began
to
prance
around
the
crowd
scaring
the
women
and
making
all
the
animals
nervous
he
stood
on
his
head
and
bellowed
and
all
the
circus
hands
came
rushing
up
finally
the
alarm
clock
quit
jingling
and
they
caught
the
seal
and
pulled
the
clock
off
his
tooth
and
just
then
pa
came
up
to
me
and
said
what
deviltry
you
boys
up
to
now
suppose
that
seal
had
swallowed
that
clock
and
you
could
wind
it
up
it
might
kill
him
now
go
to
the
car
we
are
going
to
get
out
of
this
town
right
off
you
make
me
tired
and
pa
helped
to
lift
the
slippery
seal
into
the
tank
and
looked
mad
at
his
little
boy
and
hurt
the
feelings
of
the
boy
chapter

the
show
strikes
virginia
and
the
educated
ourang
outang
has
the
whooping
cough
the
bad
boy
plays
the
part
of
a
monkey
but
they
forget
to
pin
on
a
tail
well
i
have
broke
the
show
all
to
pieces
just
by
not
being
able
to
stand
grief
everything
is
all
balled
up
the
managers
are
sore
at
me
and
afraid
of
being
sent
to
jail
and
pa
thinks
i
ought
to
be
mauled
it
was
this
way
when
we
left
washington
we
cut
loose
from
every
home
tie
and
plunged
into
virginia
and
the
trouble
began
at
once
we
met
a
lawyer
on
the
train
on
the
way
to
richmond
and
fed
him
in
our
dining
car
and
got
him
acquainted
with
all
the
performers
and
freaks
and
he
told
us
that
we
would
have
to
be
careful
in
virginia
all
the
white
people
were
first
families
and
aristocratic
and
if
any
man
about
our
show
should
fail
to
be
polite
to
the
white
people
they
would
be
shot
or
lynched
but
if
we
wanted
to
shoot
niggers
the
game
laws
were
not
very
strict
about
it
the
open
season
on
niggers
run
the
year
around
but
you
could
shoot
white
people
only
two
months
in
the
year
he
said
another
thing
that
scared
pa
and
the
managers
he
said
that
if
a
traveling
show
did
not
perform
all
it
advertised
the
owners
were
liable
to
go
to
state
prison
for
years
and
that
each
town
had
men
on
the
lookout
to
see
that
shows
did
advertise
what
they
did
carry
out
pa
and
the
managers
held
a
consultation
and
could
find
that
we
advertised
anything
that
we
did
have
except
the
ourang
outang
that
we
took
on
at
new
york
which
eats
and
dresses
like
a
man
that
animal
got
whooping
cough
in
delaware
and
had
to
be
sent
to
a
hospital
but
we
heard
he
was
well
again
and
would
join
the
show
in
a
week
pa
asked
the
richmond
lawyer
how
it
would
be
if
one
of
the
animals
that
was
advertised
was
sick
and
could
perform
and
he
told
pa
the
people
would
mob
the
show
if
anything
was
left
out
when
we
got
to
richmond
the
whole
population
principally
niggers
was
at
the
lot
when
we
put
up
the
tents
and
everybody
wanted
to
catch
a
sight
of
dennis
the
ourang
outang
and
the
posters
all
over
town
that
pictured
dennis
smoking
cigarettes
with
a
dress
suit
on
and
eating
with
a
knife
and
fork
and
a
napkin
tucked
under
his
chin
were
surrounded
by
crowds
it
was
plain
that
all
the
people
cared
for
was
to
see
the
monk
the
managers
held
a
council
of
war
and
decided
the
show
would
be
ruined
if
we
did
make
a
bluff
at
having
an
ourang
outang
so
it
was
decided
that
i
was
to
be
dressed
up
in
dennis
clothes
and
put
on
a
monkey
mask
and
go
through
his
stunt
at
the
afternoon
performance
gee
but
i
hated
to
do
it
but
pa
said
the
fate
of
the
show
depended
on
it
and
if
i
did
take
the
part
he
would
have
to
do
it
himself
and
i
knew
pa
was
the
build
of
man
to
play
the
monkey
and
so
i
said
i
would
do
it
but
i
will
never
do
it
again
for
any
show
the
wardrobe
woman
fixed
my
up
like
dennis
and
i
had
seen
him
go
through
his
stunt
so
often
i
thought
i
could
imitate
him
and
of
course
there
was
no
talking
to
do
but
just
to
grunt
once
in
awhile
the
way
dennis
did
and
have
an
animal
look
well
sir
the
keeper
who
trained
the
ourang
outang
took
me
in
hand
and
in
an
hour
i
was
perfect
i
had
rubber
feet
and
wore
black
gloves
and
had
a
tail
fastened
with
a
safety
pin
that
would
deceive
the
oldest
showman
in
the
business
when
the
crowd
was
the
biggest
in
the
middle
ring
the
keeper
led
me
out
of
the
dressing
room
with
a
chain
the
announcement
was
made
by
the
barker
that
dennis
the
educated
ourang
outang
that
had
performed
before
crowned
heads
in
europe
and
sapheads
in
newport
the
only
in
the
known
world
would
now
entertain
the
most
select
audience
that
had
ever
been
under
the
tent
then
i
was
dragged
into
the
ring
and
put
on
the
platform
illustration
the
keeper
who
trained
the
ourang
outang
took
me
in
hand
they
did
put
on
my
dress
clothes
at
first
but
had
a
little
screen
on
the
platform
for
me
to
go
behind
to
dress
and
i
appeared
first
in
the
natural
state
of
the
ourang
outang
with
a
suit
of
buffalo
robe
stuff
that
looked
exactly
like
a
big
monkey
i
bowed
and
the
audience
cheered
and
i
stood
on
my
hands
and
scratched
at
an
imaginary
flea
and
pa
who
was
leaning
against
the
platform
whispered
to
me
that
i
was
making
the
hit
of
the
season
then
the
attendants
set
the
table
and
the
keeper
took
me
behind
the
screen
and
dressed
me
and
the
old
fool
forgot
to
put
on
my
tail
he
led
me
out
and
i
sat
up
to
the
table
hitched
up
my
cuffs
put
a
napkin
under
my
chin
took
a
knife
and
fork
and
began
to
eat
just
like
a
human
being
the
audience
cheered
and
the
circus
people
crowded
around
and
said
i
was
just
as
good
as
dennis
himself
i
went
through
the
whole
of
dennis
performance
and
never
skipped
a
note
until
a
smart
white
man
yelled
where
is
the
tail
of
your
ourang
outang
and
the
crowd
began
to
be
suspicious
and
more
than
a
thousand
yelled
there
is
no
tail
on
your
monkey
that
rattled
the
trainer
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
forgotten
to
pin
the
tail
on
me
so
while
i
was
using
the
finger
bowl
he
went
to
the
screen
and
got
the
tail
and
came
out
and
was
pinning
it
on
to
my
dress
pants
when
the
audience
began
to
yell
fraud
fraud
kill
the
monk
and
a
lot
of
stuff
then
pa
got
on
a
barrel
the
elephants
had
been
performing
on
and
got
the
attention
of
the
audience
and
told
them
not
to
be
unreasonable
he
said
the
management
had
found
by
experience
that
after
the
ourang
outang
had
been
trained
to
eat
like
a
man
and
wear
men
clothes
that
his
tail
was
in
the
way
so
at
a
great
expense
the
management
had
caused
dennis
tail
to
be
amputated
at
a
new
york
hospital
and
while
we
always
carry
the
tail
along
it
was
only
used
when
a
critical
audience
demanded
it
but
if
this
refined
audience
so
desired
the
tail
would
be
attached
to
the
intelligent
animal
the
crowd
yelled
pin
on
the
tail
the
tail
goes
with
the
hide
and
the
trainer
began
to
pin
it
on
say
i
could
have
killed
that
trainer
he
run
that
safety
pin
about
an
inch
into
my
spine
and
i
jumped
into
the
air
about
four
feet
and
i
was
going
to
use
a
cuss
word
that
i
learned
in
philadelphia
but
i
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
grunt
just
as
dennis
used
to
and
chatter
like
a
monkey
and
the
day
was
saved
the
tail
was
on
and
i
turned
my
back
to
show
that
it
was
on
straight
like
a
woman
hat
when
pa
said
to
hurry
the
performance
to
a
conclusion
because
he
could
see
that
there
was
a
spirit
of
unrest
in
the
audience
and
he
would
not
be
surprised
any
moment
to
see
virginia
secede
and
go
out
of
the
union
there
was
nothing
more
for
me
to
do
except
to
drink
my
cup
of
coffee
and
smoke
my
cigarette
and
quit
and
i
was
patting
myself
on
the
back
at
my
success
and
squirming
around
in
the
chair
the
pin
in
my
tail
hurt
my
back
but
i
never
said
a
word
the
attendant
brought
in
the
coffee
and
i
took
a
couple
of
swallows
when
i
realized
that
somebody
had
put
cayenne
pepper
into
it
and
i
was
hot
under
the
collar
but
though
i
was
burning
up
inside
i
never
peeped
but
just
choked
and
took
a
swallow
of
water
and
vowed
to
kill
the
person
that
made
the
coffee
i
kept
my
temper
till
the
trainer
handed
me
the
cigarette
and
a
match
and
the
first
puff
i
realized
that
they
had
filled
the
cigarette
with
snuff
and
after
blowing
out
the
smoke
i
began
to
sneeze
and
the
audience
fairly
went
wild
i
sneezed
about
eight
times
and
at
every
sneeze
the
pin
in
my
spine
hurt
like
thunder
but
i
never
lost
my
temper
till
about
the
seventh
sneeze
when
my
monkey
mask
flew
off
and
then
a
boy
about
my
size
right
in
front
of
me
yelled
it
ai
a
monkey
at
all
it
is
a
little
nigger
and
he
threw
a
ripe
persimmon
and
hit
me
right
in
the
eye
i
said
right
out
in
plain
english
you
a
liar
and
i
can
knock
the
stuffing
out
of
you
illustration
he
hit
me
right
in
the
eye
i
pulled
off
my
dress
coat
and
started
for
him
but
pa
grabbed
me
on
one
side
and
the
monkey
trainer
on
the
other
and
they
tried
to
get
me
to
return
to
the
monkey
character
and
chatter
and
pa
put
my
monkey
mask
on
me
but
i
struck
right
there
and
pulled
it
off
and
told
him
and
the
managers
that
i
would
not
play
monkey
any
more
with
a
tail
pinned
to
my
spine
my
stomach
full
of
cayenne
pepper
and
my
nostrils
full
of
scotch
snuff
and
my
face
all
puckered
up
with
persimmons
the
crowd
yelled
fraud
fraud
kill
the
old
man
who
is
the
father
of
the
monkey
and
they
were
making
a
rush
to
clean
out
the
show
when
the
door
opened
to
let
the
hippodrome
chariot
racers
out
and
the
way
the
chariots
scattered
the
crowd
was
a
caution
that
saved
us
from
serious
trouble
for
the
chariots
run
over
a
lot
of
negroes
which
pleased
the
audience
and
they
let
us
off
without
killing
us
they
got
me
back
to
the
and
had
to
take
a
pair
of
pinchers
to
get
that
safety
pin
out
of
my
spine
and
on
the
way
to
the
some
one
walked
on
my
monkey
tail
and
pulled
it
off
and
that
was
a
dead
loss
pa
sat
by
me
and
fanned
me
i
was
faint
and
then
he
said
my
boy
you
played
your
part
well
until
the
persimmon
hit
you
and
then
you
forgot
that
you
were
an
actor
and
became
yourself
and
i
do
blame
you
for
wanting
to
punch
that
boy
who
called
you
a
little
nigger
and
said
i
was
your
after
this
chariot
race
is
over
we
will
go
around
in
front
of
the
seats
and
find
the
boy
and
you
can
do
him
up
your
monkey
business
was
the
feature
of
the
show
we
went
out
and
found
a
boy
that
looked
like
the
one
that
sassed
me
but
he
must
have
been
his
big
brother
when
i
went
up
to
him
and
swatted
him
on
the
nose
he
gave
me
a
black
eye
and
i
am
a
sight
that
evening
at
the
performance
we
cut
out
the
educated
ourang
outang
and
the
lawyer
we
met
on
the
cars
came
to
the
show
and
said
we
would
all
be
arrested
for
not
performing
all
we
advertised
but
he
could
settle
it
for
a
hundred
dollars
and
pa
paid
him
the
money
and
he
went
out
and
got
a
jag
and
came
in
the
show
and
was
going
to
make
trouble
when
pa
took
him
to
the
cage
where
the
boa
constrictor
was
uncoiling
itself
and
the
virginian
got
one
look
at
the
snake
and
went
through
the
side
of
the
tent
yelling
i
got
again
catch
me
somebody
we
got
out
of
town
before
morning
and
nobody
was
arrested
except
the
negroes
that
got
run
over
in
the
chariot
race
chapter
xix
the
circus
people
visit
a
southern
plantation
pa
the
giant
and
the
fat
woman
are
chased
by
bloodhounds
the
bad
boy
runs
the
gauntlet
gee
but
pa
is
sore
at
me
he
has
been
disgusted
with
me
before
but
he
never
had
it
in
for
me
so
serious
as
he
has
now
i
guess
the
whole
show
would
breathe
easier
if
i
should
fall
off
the
train
some
dark
night
when
it
was
stormy
and
we
were
crossing
a
high
bridge
over
a
stream
that
was
out
of
its
banks
on
account
of
a
freshet
it
was
all
on
account
of
our
taking
an
afternoon
off
on
a
sunday
at
richmond
an
old
planter
that
used
to
be
in
the
circus
business
before
the
war
thought
it
would
bring
back
old
recollections
to
him
and
give
us
a
taste
of
country
life
in
the
south
if
he
invited
all
of
us
performers
managers
freaks
and
everything
to
spend
the
day
on
his
plantation
and
go
nutting
for
chestnuts
and
hickory
nuts
pick
apples
and
run
them
through
a
cider
mill
and
drink
cider
and
have
a
good
time
we
all
appreciated
the
invitation
and
after
breakfast
we
rode
out
in
the
country
to
his
plantation
in
carriages
and
express
wagons
and
began
to
do
the
plantation
the
fat
lady
and
the
midgets
rode
out
together
in
a
load
of
cotton
and
when
they
got
to
the
house
they
had
to
be
picked
like
ducks
and
they
looked
as
though
they
had
been
tarred
and
feathered
the
planter
gave
us
a
fine
luncheon
of
fried
chicken
and
corn
pone
and
cider
and
pa
acted
as
the
boss
of
the
circus
folks
while
the
planter
and
his
family
with
about
negroes
passed
things
around
they
all
seemed
to
be
interested
in
seeing
how
much
stuff
the
giant
and
the
fat
lady
could
hold
without
putting
up
sideboards
to
keep
the
food
from
falling
off
if
pa
had
told
the
negroes
not
to
feed
the
fat
lady
and
the
giant
any
more
there
would
have
been
two
circus
funerals
next
day
i
got
acquainted
with
a
boy
that
was
the
planter
son
and
while
the
rest
were
eating
and
drinking
the
boy
showed
me
a
pack
of
hounds
that
are
kept
for
trailing
criminals
and
negroes
who
have
looked
sassy
at
white
women
the
trouble
with
negroes
is
that
they
all
look
alike
and
if
one
commits
a
crime
they
can
prove
an
alibi
every
last
negro
will
swear
that
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed
the
suspected
man
was
attending
a
prayer
meeting
so
they
have
to
have
hounds
that
can
be
taken
to
the
place
where
the
crime
was
committed
and
they
find
the
negro
track
and
they
follow
it
till
they
tree
him
the
hounds
do
not
bite
the
negro
like
we
used
to
hear
about
but
they
just
follow
him
till
he
is
treed
and
then
they
bark
as
much
as
to
say
ah
there
mr
nigger
you
just
stay
where
you
are
till
the
sheriff
comes
to
fetch
you
and
negro
just
turns
pale
and
stays
on
a
limb
till
the
sheriff
comes
with
his
lynching
tools
when
the
sheriff
pulls
a
gun
the
negro
confesses
right
there
and
the
deputy
sheriff
brings
the
rope
i
asked
the
boy
if
the
hounds
would
trail
a
white
man
without
hurting
him
and
he
said
if
you
put
anise
seed
on
their
shoes
the
hounds
will
trail
all
right
so
we
put
up
a
job
to
have
some
fun
the
boy
gave
me
some
anise
seed
and
told
me
to
put
it
on
the
shoes
of
anybody
i
wanted
trailed
and
after
they
got
out
in
the
woods
he
would
put
the
hounds
on
the
trail
and
the
people
would
have
to
get
up
trees
or
have
their
pants
chewed
but
the
dogs
would
not
hurt
anybody
well
it
made
me
laugh
to
think
about
it
i
went
to
pa
and
told
him
his
shoes
were
all
covered
with
red
virginia
dust
and
i
took
my
handkerchief
and
dusted
them
off
and
made
him
hold
up
his
foot
like
a
horse
that
is
being
shod
then
i
put
a
handful
of
anise
seed
around
the
sole
and
in
his
shoes
he
said
it
was
mighty
kind
in
me
to
do
it
then
i
went
to
the
giant
and
brushed
the
dust
off
his
shoes
and
put
two
handfuls
of
anise
seed
in
them
and
he
said
i
was
a
nice
boy
i
told
the
fat
woman
about
the
dust
on
her
telescope
valises
and
i
rubbed
it
off
and
gave
her
feet
a
dose
of
anise
seed
that
ought
to
have
paralyzed
a
pack
of
hounds
she
wanted
to
hug
me
and
let
me
kiss
her
but
i
said
i
passed
and
she
said
she
would
do
as
much
for
me
some
time
about
this
time
the
planter
took
the
lead
and
they
all
went
across
a
pasture
into
the
woods
and
began
knocking
nuts
off
the
trees
all
through
the
woods
there
were
signs
no
tresspassing
and
beware
of
the
dogs
but
the
planter
said
to
never
mind
the
signs
i
told
the
boy
to
let
the
dogs
loose
on
the
trail
in
about
half
an
hour
and
i
went
along
with
the
folks
and
i
told
pa
i
had
seen
a
pack
of
bloodhounds
that
would
eat
people
alive
and
if
he
heard
hounds
barking
to
run
like
a
whitehead
and
climb
a
tree
i
got
with
the
giant
who
is
a
coward
in
his
own
right
and
told
him
the
only
trouble
about
these
great
plantations
in
the
south
was
the
wild
dogs
that
inhabited
the
mountains
that
would
not
hesitate
to
attack
a
man
if
they
got
good
and
hungry
but
there
was
no
danger
to
him
because
he
was
a
good
sprinter
and
could
outrun
a
jack
rabbit
the
giant
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
house
he
said
he
did
want
to
run
no
foot
race
with
hounds
and
he
had
seen
the
sign
to
beware
of
the
dogs
i
never
ought
to
have
done
it
the
fat
woman
looks
as
though
she
was
built
a
purpose
for
apoplexy
but
i
told
her
as
a
friend
not
to
load
herself
down
with
nuts
but
to
travel
light
so
if
the
wild
dogs
came
down
to
raid
the
plantation
she
could
crawl
in
a
hole
out
of
sight
till
the
dogs
had
eaten
some
of
the
men
she
came
near
fainting
right
there
before
the
dogs
got
busy
there
were
about
negroes
throwing
clubs
at
the
nuts
and
everybody
was
having
a
big
time
the
trapeze
performers
were
squirreling
up
among
the
limbs
when
suddenly
in
the
distance
came
the
bay
of
the
pack
of
bloodhounds
and
every
negro
turned
pale
and
got
ready
to
climb
a
tree
the
planter
stopped
to
listen
and
when
one
of
the
managers
of
the
show
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
he
said
you
can
search
me
sah
if
that
is
my
pack
of
hounds
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
the
sheriff
has
started
the
pack
on
the
trail
of
the
criminal
sah
because
the
dogs
are
never
turned
loose
except
for
business
then
the
planter
yelled
to
the
niggers
and
said
if
any
of
youall
are
guilty
of
crime
you
best
get
scarce
or
pick
out
your
tree
and
get
up
it
mighty
sudden
the
hounds
have
been
fed
lately
every
colored
man
picked
a
tree
and
the
hounds
kept
coming
finally
showing
up
jumping
the
fence
and
entering
the
woods
and
the
planter
cut
a
club
to
beat
off
the
dogs
pa
looked
as
innocent
as
john
wanamaker
picture
addressing
a
sunday
school
the
giant
saw
the
dogs
and
started
for
a
tall
tree
and
the
fat
lady
said
she
could
find
any
hole
big
enough
to
hide
in
and
the
idea
if
there
were
not
men
enough
to
protect
a
lady
well
i
never
expected
to
see
anything
so
fine
as
the
way
those
hounds
run
with
their
noses
to
the
ground
scattered
in
three
packs
one
pack
on
the
trail
of
each
of
the
three
whose
shoes
i
had
doctored
when
they
got
near
us
they
broke
up
and
went
around
everywhere
that
pa
and
the
giant
and
the
fat
lady
had
walked
and
fell
over
each
other
but
finally
one
pack
went
to
the
tall
tree
where
the
giant
had
climbed
to
the
first
limb
and
stood
on
their
hind
legs
and
barked
a
salute
to
him
he
trembled
so
i
was
afraid
he
would
fall
off
but
he
wound
his
arms
and
legs
around
the
tree
and
began
to
cry
the
planter
told
him
whatever
crime
he
had
committed
it
was
all
up
with
him
the
part
of
the
pack
that
was
on
pa
trail
began
to
close
in
on
pa
and
i
said
pa
if
you
do
want
to
be
dog
meat
it
is
up
to
you
to
climb
and
you
better
get
a
move
on
or
i
shall
be
an
orphan
mighty
quick
the
dogs
are
starving
pa
made
a
couple
of
quick
jumps
and
grabbed
a
limb
of
a
hickory
tree
and
was
pulling
himself
up
and
repeating
prayers
when
the
leading
dog
reached
up
his
nose
and
smelled
pa
shoes
when
the
intelligent
animal
gave
a
bark
and
a
yell
to
the
other
dogs
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
identical
cuss
eat
him
alive
he
grabbed
about
a
double
handful
of
the
cloth
of
pa
clothes
right
below
where
his
suspenders
button
on
and
held
on
and
shook
pa
real
hard
but
the
cloth
was
tough
and
did
tear
pa
suddenly
seemed
to
be
endowed
with
superhuman
strength
for
he
drew
himself
up
on
the
limb
and
raised
the
dog
from
the
ground
and
all
the
pack
came
around
the
tree
and
set
up
a
howl
that
scared
pa
so
the
perspiration
rolled
off
him
and
he
had
a
chill
so
he
shook
like
the
ague
pa
yelled
to
the
planter
who
was
holding
up
the
fat
lady
and
said
here
confederate
i
am
not
a
union
prisoner
and
i
want
you
to
unlock
your
dog
jaws
and
free
me
i
ca
hold
up
a
dog
by
my
suspenders
much
longer
if
this
is
southern
hospitality
i
do
want
to
be
entertained
no
more
the
planter
leaned
the
fat
lady
against
a
tree
and
took
the
dog
by
the
hind
legs
and
pulled
him
off
illustration
here
confederate
i
am
not
a
union
prisoner
the
planter
yelled
to
the
negroes
to
come
down
and
help
handle
the
dogs
but
just
then
the
boy
who
started
the
dogs
on
the
trail
at
my
request
came
up
whistling
with
a
dog
whip
in
his
hand
and
all
the
dogs
surrounded
him
and
he
made
them
lay
down
and
roll
over
all
of
the
scared
people
came
down
from
their
perches
in
the
trees
and
surrounded
the
boy
and
the
dogs
and
the
dogs
panted
and
lolled
as
though
they
had
been
having
a
nice
run
for
their
money
the
old
planter
asked
his
boy
how
the
dogs
had
happened
to
get
loose
and
that
fool
boy
told
the
whole
thing
how
i
had
asked
him
to
let
the
pack
run
and
how
i
had
put
anise
seed
in
the
shoes
of
pa
the
giant
and
the
fat
lady
then
you
ought
to
have
seen
what
they
did
to
me
the
planter
said
they
usually
had
a
lynching
when
the
dogs
made
a
run
but
that
was
impossible
in
this
case
so
he
suggested
that
they
make
me
run
the
gauntlet
i
did
know
what
running
the
gauntlet
was
but
after
pa
had
told
me
he
should
disown
me
from
that
moment
i
said
i
was
willing
to
run
any
gauntlet
so
they
all
cut
switches
and
formed
in
two
lines
and
let
me
run
down
between
them
i
thought
it
would
be
fun
but
when
i
started
and
every
last
man
gave
me
a
cut
across
the
end
of
my
back
with
a
hickory
switch
i
yelled
murder
and
run
between
the
giant
legs
and
tackled
him
like
football
i
toppled
him
over
against
the
next
man
and
that
man
hit
the
giant
in
the
stomach
and
everybody
began
to
fight
and
the
festivities
broke
up
illustration
i
yelled
murder
and
ran
between
the
giant
legs
i
went
to
the
house
with
the
boy
and
the
dogs
and
we
set
the
dogs
on
a
mess
of
cats
and
treed
everything
alive
on
the
plantation
finally
the
whole
crowd
came
back
to
the
house
and
had
another
lunch
with
mint
julep
and
champagne
and
then
everybody
was
hugging
some
one
and
crying
on
each
other
neck
and
swearing
that
the
war
was
over
and
that
the
north
and
the
south
were
one
and
inseparable
and
the
two
together
could
whip
the
whole
world
pa
somehow
saw
double
i
was
standing
alone
smarting
from
the
switching
i
got
when
pa
came
up
to
me
and
said
i
want
you
two
boys
to
understand
that
i
do
want
any
more
experiments
played
on
me
i
can
take
a
joke
us
well
as
anybody
but
when
you
set
a
hundred
dogs
on
my
trail
i
am
no
gentlemen
see
now
we
will
go
back
to
the
show
chapter
xx
the
bad
boy
goes
after
a
mess
of
white
turnips
for
the
menagerie
he
feeds
the
animals
horseradish
but
gets
the
worst
of
the
deal
you
can
learn
something
new
and
interesting
every
day
in
a
circus
and
a
boy
particularly
can
store
his
mind
with
useful
knowledge
that
will
be
valuable
to
him
in
after
years
gee
but
i
have
learned
some
things
that
i
could
never
have
learned
in
college
at
college
you
only
learn
things
that
have
to
be
verified
by
actual
experience
in
business
pa
says
one
year
in
the
circus
will
be
better
for
me
than
ten
years
in
a
reform
school
but
i
learned
something
yesterday
that
made
such
an
impression
on
me
that
i
will
not
be
able
to
sit
down
comfortably
before
the
season
is
over
you
see
it
was
this
way
once
a
week
it
is
the
custom
to
feed
all
the
animals
that
are
vegetarians
a
mess
of
ground
white
turnips
it
opens
up
the
pores
and
makes
the
animals
feel
good
like
a
politician
who
goes
to
french
lick
springs
and
has
the
whisky
boiled
out
of
him
after
the
animals
have
eaten
the
turnip
mush
they
become
agreeable
and
will
rub
against
the
keepers
and
eat
out
of
your
hand
i
had
been
with
pa
a
dozen
times
to
find
a
place
where
we
could
get
a
few
barrels
of
turnips
ground
up
fine
and
so
yesterday
when
the
boss
animal
keeper
was
sick
and
turned
his
job
over
to
pa
pa
told
me
to
go
out
in
town
at
lynchburg
and
get
a
couple
of
washtubs
full
of
ground
turnips
and
have
the
stuff
sent
in
to
the
menagerie
tent
in
time
for
the
afternoon
performance
i
got
a
boy
to
go
with
me
we
hunted
all
the
groceries
and
could
find
turnips
enough
to
make
a
first
payment
but
we
found
a
place
where
they
grate
horseradish
and
bottle
it
for
the
market
and
i
ordered
two
washtubs
full
of
horseradish
grated
nicely
and
sent
to
the
tent
but
i
made
the
man
bill
it
as
ground
turnips
the
boy
and
i
played
all
the
forenoon
and
when
the
man
started
with
the
ground
horseradish
for
the
tent
we
went
along
and
i
introduced
the
man
to
pa
and
pa
the
bill
and
sent
him
to
the
treasurer
after
the
money
i
was
going
to
get
on
a
back
seat
and
watch
the
animals
eat
but
pa
said
here
you
boys
get
out
those
pans
and
portion
out
the
turnips
and
pass
around
just
as
the
crowd
comes
in
after
the
animals
have
had
a
mess
of
cut
feed
they
are
better
natured
and
show
off
better
i
was
pretty
leery
about
feeding
the
animals
horseradish
and
would
have
preferred
to
have
some
one
else
do
it
who
did
not
care
to
live
any
longer
but
i
said
yes
sir
just
like
that
and
touched
my
hat
to
pa
and
he
said
to
the
boss
canvasman
there
a
boy
you
can
swear
by
the
boss
canvasman
said
you
are
right
old
man
but
if
he
was
mine
i
would
kill
him
so
quick
it
would
make
your
head
swim
and
he
and
pa
went
off
laughing
but
i
think
they
laughed
too
soon
well
we
took
a
spud
and
put
about
a
quart
of
horseradish
in
each
pan
and
put
the
pans
in
front
of
each
animal
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
them
rush
for
the
supposed
turnips
like
a
drove
of
cattle
after
salt
the
boy
and
i
got
up
on
the
platform
with
the
freaks
to
be
in
a
safe
place
and
watch
the
animals
and
see
how
they
digested
their
food
the
first
animal
to
open
up
the
chorus
was
the
hippopotamus
we
gave
him
about
four
quarts
of
horseradish
on
account
of
his
mouth
and
he
swallowed
it
at
one
mouthful
first
he
looked
as
though
he
felt
hurt
and
stopped
chewing
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
like
a
horse
that
wakes
up
in
the
night
with
colic
and
raises
the
whole
family
to
sit
up
with
him
all
night
and
pour
things
down
his
neck
out
of
a
bottle
the
hippo
held
his
breath
for
about
a
minute
and
then
he
opened
his
mouth
so
you
could
drive
a
wagon
in
and
gave
the
grand
hailing
sign
of
distress
and
said
wow
wow
wow
as
plain
as
a
man
could
then
he
rolled
over
into
his
tank
and
yelled
murder
and
wallowed
around
and
stood
on
his
head
till
one
of
the
keepers
went
in
the
cage
to
try
to
soothe
him
he
chased
the
keeper
out
and
the
crowd
that
had
just
begun
to
come
in
fell
back
in
terror
there
was
quite
a
crowd
around
the
camels
watching
them
peacefully
chew
their
cuds
as
they
do
at
evening
on
the
dessert
and
the
arabs
who
had
charge
of
the
camels
were
standing
around
posing
as
though
they
were
the
whole
thing
when
the
old
black
camel
got
his
quart
of
horseradish
down
into
one
of
his
stomachs
as
he
was
kneeling
down
on
all
fours
he
yelled
o
mamma
and
got
up
on
all
his
feet
and
kicked
an
arab
off
a
prayer
rug
and
bellowed
and
groaned
then
the
rest
of
the
herd
of
camels
seemed
to
have
swallowed
their
dose
and
they
made
rome
howl
this
scared
the
people
over
to
where
the
sacred
cattle
were
trying
to
set
a
pious
example
to
the
rest
of
the
animals
by
their
meek
and
lowly
conduct
illustration
the
camel
kicked
an
arab
off
a
rug
the
sacred
cow
got
her
horseradish
first
and
i
could
see
she
was
trying
to
hold
it
without
giving
the
snap
away
till
her
husband
the
bull
got
his
well
it
was
pitiful
and
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
never
play
a
joke
on
the
sacred
cattle
again
it
seems
like
sacrilege
the
bull
finally
got
his
horseradish
down
and
he
was
the
most
astonished
animal
i
ever
saw
he
swelled
up
and
then
bellowed
until
the
cow
looked
as
though
she
would
sink
through
the
ground
saying
excuse
me
dear
but
i
am
not
to
blame
because
i
too
have
a
hot
box
the
bull
acted
just
as
human
as
could
be
he
looked
mad
at
her
and
was
going
to
gore
her
to
death
when
pa
and
some
of
the
hands
came
up
and
hit
him
with
a
tent
stake
and
swore
at
him
and
he
quit
fighting
his
wife
just
like
a
man
pa
wanted
to
know
what
in
thunder
was
the
matter
with
the
animals
and
wanted
to
know
if
i
had
fed
them
the
turnips
and
i
told
him
they
had
all
been
fed
and
just
then
the
giraffe
whose
neck
was
so
long
the
horseradish
did
not
reach
a
vital
spot
as
quick
as
it
did
with
the
hippo
began
to
yell
for
the
police
and
dance
around
finally
he
stood
on
his
head
and
neck
with
his
heels
against
a
cage
and
coughed
like
he
had
caught
pneumonia
pa
said
to
the
boss
canvasman
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
the
zebras
had
their
inning
next
and
after
they
had
swallowed
their
rations
of
horseradish
they
never
said
a
word
but
began
to
run
around
like
dancing
the
lancers
and
when
they
got
to
going
it
looked
like
a
kaleidoscope
and
the
six
zebras
looked
like
a
million
pa
said
i
never
saw
such
a
sight
since
i
used
to
drink
but
i
have
either
got
the
or
something
awful
has
happened
to
this
menagerie
the
educated
hog
got
a
double
dose
and
he
squealed
and
could
pick
out
the
right
card
and
then
the
llamas
got
busy
on
their
portion
of
horseradish
and
they
cried
in
spanish
and
stood
on
their
hind
legs
and
shed
tears
pa
got
so
rattled
he
looked
ten
years
older
than
he
did
when
the
afternoon
performance
opened
the
manager
of
the
big
show
came
in
to
know
why
the
elephants
had
not
been
sent
into
the
to
be
got
ready
for
the
grand
entree
just
then
the
elephants
began
to
eat
their
horseradish
and
when
they
were
driven
into
the
big
tent
they
were
complaining
about
something
being
wrong
inside
of
them
and
as
they
came
by
the
lemonade
stand
they
seemed
to
be
yelling
fire
then
they
all
stopped
at
the
stand
and
began
to
drink
the
lemonade
out
of
the
barrels
which
seemed
to
put
out
the
fire
the
animals
quieted
down
a
little
and
pa
went
into
the
big
tent
to
consult
the
manager
and
i
thought
it
was
a
shame
that
the
lions
and
hyenas
and
tigers
could
have
any
fun
so
i
went
to
the
table
where
the
meat
was
laid
out
ready
to
feed
them
and
cut
a
hole
in
each
piece
of
meat
and
put
in
a
double
handful
of
horseradish
and
just
then
the
feeder
came
along
and
began
to
throw
the
meat
in
the
cages
gee
but
those
carnivorous
animals
are
bad
enough
even
if
you
give
them
nice
boiled
sirloin
steak
and
they
fight
enough
over
it
at
any
time
but
when
they
began
to
chew
and
tear
the
meat
and
get
horseradish
hot
from
the
griddle
they
did
do
a
thing
the
audience
thought
the
animals
would
kill
everybody
the
big
lion
got
his
meat
down
but
it
did
set
well
and
he
turned
a
somersault
and
snarled
and
pulled
the
bars
of
the
cage
while
the
grizzly
bear
rolled
up
in
a
ball
and
rolled
over
in
his
cage
till
the
men
had
to
hold
on
to
the
wheels
to
keep
the
shebang
from
going
over
the
hyenas
who
are
always
mad
went
on
a
tear
that
could
be
heard
in
all
the
tents
pa
and
the
managers
came
back
into
the
menagerie
tent
with
the
animal
keeper
who
had
been
sent
for
and
they
began
to
try
to
find
out
what
ailed
the
animals
and
the
animal
keeper
asked
what
pa
had
been
feeding
them
and
pa
said
he
had
given
them
their
ground
turnips
turnips
indeed
said
the
keeper
as
he
took
up
some
of
the
turnip
and
tasted
of
it
and
he
handed
a
handful
to
pa
tasted
it
and
pa
had
a
hot
box
and
the
managers
tasted
of
it
and
they
said
no
wonder
then
they
asked
pa
where
he
got
it
and
pa
said
he
sent
me
to
order
it
and
then
they
all
said
that
settles
it
illustration
pa
tasted
of
it
i
thought
i
would
go
and
jump
in
the
river
but
pa
said
hennery
come
here
my
angel
and
he
spit
on
his
hands
and
picked
up
a
barrel
stave
i
went
right
up
to
pa
as
innocent
as
could
be
just
as
any
dutiful
son
should
and
right
there
before
the
animals
and
freaks
pa
well
that
the
reason
i
am
not
sitting
down
very
much
these
days
so
long
chapter
xxi
the
bad
boy
and
his
pa
inject
a
little
politics
into
the
show
rival
bands
of
atlanta
citizens
meet
in
the
circus
tent
a
bunch
of
angry
hornets
causes
much
bitter
feeling
i
expect
that
next
year
i
shall
be
one
of
the
managers
of
this
show
they
tell
me
i
have
got
the
greatest
head
of
any
boy
that
has
ever
traveled
with
the
show
we
have
been
having
a
very
big
business
in
the
south
because
the
negroes
have
money
enough
to
patronize
shows
and
a
lot
of
the
white
people
are
either
too
or
else
they
are
politicians
and
want
a
pass
the
managers
and
heads
of
departments
held
a
meeting
to
devise
some
way
to
get
both
classes
interested
and
everybody
was
asked
to
state
their
views
after
they
all
got
through
talking
pa
asked
me
what
i
thought
would
be
the
best
way
to
get
the
people
excited
about
the
show
and
i
told
him
there
was
no
way
except
to
inject
a
little
politics
into
it
i
said
if
they
would
give
me
or
so
to
buy
chinese
lanterns
and
about
a
hundred
complimentary
tickets
to
give
away
pa
and
i
could
go
to
atlanta
a
couple
of
days
ahead
of
the
show
and
we
could
organize
a
roosevelt
club
among
the
negroes
and
a
bryan
club
among
the
white
fellows
and
at
the
evening
performance
we
could
have
the
two
clubs
march
into
the
main
tent
one
from
the
main
entrance
and
one
from
the
dressing
room
with
chinese
lanterns
and
one
could
yell
for
roosevelt
and
the
other
for
bryan
and
advertise
that
a
great
sensation
would
be
sprung
at
the
evening
performance
i
said
the
tent
would
begin
to
hold
the
people
every
one
of
the
managers
and
heads
of
departments
said
it
would
be
great
stuff
pa
was
the
only
one
that
kicked
he
said
the
two
processions
might
get
into
a
fight
but
i
said
what
if
they
did
we
would
be
to
blame
let
fight
if
they
want
to
and
we
can
see
fair
play
so
they
all
agreed
that
pa
and
i
should
go
to
atlanta
ahead
and
organize
the
political
processions
and
say
we
had
such
a
time
that
the
circus
came
near
never
getting
out
of
the
town
alive
we
overdid
the
thing
so
they
wanted
to
lynch
me
and
pa
wanted
to
help
the
way
it
was
was
this
way
pa
was
to
organize
the
white
men
for
bryan
and
i
was
to
organize
the
negroes
for
roosevelt
and
we
went
to
work
and
bought
chinese
lanterns
and
pa
stored
his
half
of
the
lanterns
in
a
barn
on
the
circus
lot
and
i
stored
mine
in
another
barn
owned
by
a
negro
that
i
gave
five
dollars
to
be
my
assistant
with
a
promise
that
he
should
have
a
job
traveling
with
the
show
to
milk
the
sacred
cow
i
told
this
negro
what
the
program
was
and
that
i
wanted
negroes
who
had
an
ambition
to
be
politicians
and
hold
office
and
i
would
not
only
pass
them
into
the
show
free
but
see
that
they
got
a
permanent
office
what
we
had
got
to
do
i
said
was
to
stampede
the
white
procession
that
would
be
led
by
pa
and
the
way
to
do
it
was
for
every
negro
in
my
party
to
skirmish
around
in
the
woods
and
find
a
hornet
nest
and
bring
it
to
our
barn
and
fit
it
into
one
of
the
chinese
lanterns
and
fix
a
candle
on
top
of
the
nest
while
the
hornets
were
asleep
then
when
we
met
the
bryan
procession
we
were
to
shout
and
wave
our
lanterns
and
if
necessary
to
whack
the
white
men
over
the
head
with
the
lantern
with
the
hornets
nest
and
the
hornets
would
wake
up
and
do
the
rest
the
negro
wanted
to
know
how
i
could
prevent
the
hornets
from
stinging
our
own
men
and
i
told
him
that
we
had
been
in
the
hornet
business
all
the
season
and
never
had
one
of
our
own
men
stung
i
said
we
took
some
assafoetida
and
rubbed
it
on
our
clothes
and
faces
and
the
hornets
would
touch
us
but
just
went
for
the
other
fellows
to
beat
the
band
say
negroes
are
easy
marks
you
can
make
them
believe
anything
but
if
i
ever
get
to
be
president
i
am
going
to
appoint
my
negro
assistant
to
a
position
in
my
cabinet
he
is
the
greatest
political
organizer
i
ever
saw
he
rounded
up
over
cotton
pickers
and
negro
men
who
work
in
the
freight
depots
once
in
a
while
and
started
them
out
after
hornets
nests
he
gave
them
some
change
to
get
a
drink
and
promised
them
free
passes
into
the
show
next
night
and
the
next
morning
they
showed
up
with
hornets
nests
enough
to
scare
you
they
put
them
in
a
dark
place
in
the
barn
so
the
hornets
would
get
curious
and
want
to
come
out
of
the
nests
before
they
got
their
cue
that
afternoon
we
fitted
them
into
the
chinese
lanterns
and
tied
sticks
on
the
lanterns
and
fixed
the
candles
and
when
night
came
there
were
more
negroes
than
i
could
use
but
i
told
them
to
follow
along
and
the
door
tender
would
let
them
in
and
all
they
need
to
do
was
to
yell
for
teddy
when
i
did
and
so
we
marched
to
the
main
tent
about
the
time
the
performance
got
to
going
i
saw
pa
with
his
gang
of
white
men
go
into
the
dressing
room
at
about
the
same
time
the
manager
had
timed
it
for
us
to
come
in
about
into
the
main
tent
when
the
elephants
were
in
their
pyramid
act
so
my
crowd
of
negroes
stopped
in
the
menagerie
tent
half
an
hour
waiting
to
be
called
i
wish
i
was
so
confounded
curious
but
i
suppose
i
was
born
that
way
i
took
one
of
the
chinese
lanterns
that
was
not
lighted
and
just
thought
i
would
like
to
see
what
the
hyenas
and
the
big
lion
who
were
in
the
same
cage
with
an
iron
partition
between
them
would
do
if
a
chinese
lantern
was
put
in
the
cage
so
i
got
the
fellow
that
watches
the
cage
to
open
up
the
top
trap
door
and
i
dropped
a
chinese
lantern
with
a
hornets
nest
in
it
right
between
the
two
hyenas
gee
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
them
pounce
on
it
and
bite
it
and
tear
it
up
and
then
the
hornets
woke
up
and
they
did
do
a
thing
to
that
mess
of
hyenas
the
hyenas
set
up
a
grand
hailing
sign
of
distress
and
howled
pitiful
and
the
lion
raised
up
his
head
and
looked
at
them
through
the
bars
as
though
he
was
saying
in
a
snarling
way
what
you
grave
robbers
howling
about
ca
you
keep
still
and
let
the
czar
of
all
the
animals
enjoy
his
after
dinner
nap
just
then
the
hyenas
kicked
what
was
left
of
the
hornets
nest
under
the
bars
into
his
side
of
the
cage
and
he
put
his
foot
on
it
and
growled
and
about
a
hundred
hornets
gave
him
his
he
gave
an
abyssinian
cough
that
woke
all
the
animals
and
then
the
hornets
scattered
and
before
i
knew
it
the
zebras
were
dancing
a
snake
dance
and
all
of
them
were
howling
as
though
they
were
in
the
ark
hungry
and
the
ark
had
landed
on
mount
ararat
just
then
one
of
the
assistant
managers
beckoned
to
me
to
lead
in
my
procession
and
we
lighted
the
candles
in
our
chinese
lanterns
i
stop
to
see
how
the
animals
got
along
with
the
hornets
but
i
help
thinking
that
if
one
hornets
nest
could
raise
such
a
row
what
would
a
hundred
or
so
do
when
we
got
to
going
in
the
other
tent
oh
if
i
had
only
died
when
i
was
young
i
never
would
have
witnessed
that
sight
the
band
played
there
be
a
hot
time
in
the
old
town
and
pa
crowd
of
white
trash
marched
around
the
big
outside
ring
shouting
bryan
bryan
what
the
matter
with
bryan
and
the
audience
got
up
on
its
hind
legs
and
yelled
that
is
the
white
folks
did
and
then
we
marched
around
the
other
way
and
yelled
teddy
is
the
stuff
teddy
is
the
stuff
and
the
negroes
in
the
audience
yelled
then
my
crowd
met
pa
crowd
right
by
the
middle
ring
where
the
elephants
had
formed
the
pyramid
that
closes
their
act
and
the
japanese
jugglers
were
in
the
ring
and
a
party
of
female
tumblers
with
stockings
were
standing
at
attention
in
the
ring
there
was
no
intention
of
having
a
riot
but
when
pa
yelled
what
the
matter
with
bryan
a
negro
in
my
crowd
yelled
that
what
the
matter
with
bryan
and
he
hit
pa
over
the
head
with
his
chinese
lantern
loaded
with
a
warm
hornets
nest
as
big
as
a
football
which
had
taken
fire
from
the
candle
pa
dropped
his
lantern
and
began
to
fight
hornets
and
then
all
the
white
trash
in
pa
bunch
rushed
up
and
began
to
whack
my
poor
downtrodden
negroes
with
their
chinese
lanterns
of
course
my
fellows
could
stand
still
and
be
mauled
and
the
candles
had
warmed
our
hornets
nests
so
the
hornets
were
crawling
out
to
see
what
was
the
trouble
then
every
negro
whacked
a
white
man
with
a
hornets
nest
and
the
audience
fairly
went
wild
with
excitement
illustration
he
hit
pa
over
the
head
with
his
chinese
lanterns
the
hornets
got
busy
and
went
for
the
elephants
and
the
japanese
jugglers
and
they
stampeded
like
they
never
met
a
hornet
before
illustration
the
stampeded
like
they
never
met
a
hornet
before
the
female
tumblers
found
hornets
on
their
stockings
and
everywhere
and
they
gave
a
female
war
whoop
and
rushed
for
the
dressing
room
the
elephants
got
stung
and
they
came
down
off
their
pyramid
and
went
out
to
the
menagerie
tent
trumpeting
and
switching
their
trunks
the
negroes
and
the
white
politicians
were
getting
into
a
race
war
so
the
circus
hands
rushed
in
and
separated
them
and
my
negroes
found
that
the
fetty
i
had
them
rub
on
themselves
did
not
keep
the
hornets
from
stinging
them
so
they
stampeded
then
the
hornets
began
to
go
for
the
audience
and
the
women
yelled
murder
and
pulled
down
their
dresses
to
cover
their
shoes
and
the
men
got
stung
and
the
whole
audience
stampeded
into
the
open
air
then
i
met
pa
and
he
was
a
sight
and
i
never
got
stung
once
the
managers
tried
to
get
the
band
to
play
some
tune
that
would
soothe
and
hold
the
audience
till
an
explanation
could
be
made
but
somebody
had
thrown
a
hornets
nest
under
the
band
seats
and
the
horn
players
got
stung
on
the
lips
so
they
could
play
and
the
band
all
lit
out
for
a
beer
garden
before
i
realized
it
the
show
was
over
and
a
detective
that
detects
for
the
show
had
me
collared
and
brought
me
up
before
a
meeting
of
the
managers
pa
was
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
told
them
that
i
did
run
my
politics
fair
i
had
brought
in
a
lot
of
ringers
the
managers
asked
me
how
the
hornets
nests
came
to
be
in
the
chinese
lanterns
i
told
them
they
would
have
to
ask
the
negroes
for
how
was
i
to
know
what
weapons
they
had
concealed
about
their
persons
any
more
than
pa
was
responsible
if
his
politicians
carried
revolvers
they
said
that
looked
reasonable
but
they
believed
i
knew
more
about
it
than
anybody
but
as
we
had
to
pack
up
the
show
and
make
the
next
town
they
would
lynch
me
till
the
next
day
pa
got
me
to
put
cold
cream
on
his
stings
and
then
he
said
hennery
you
are
the
limit
chapter
xxii
the
show
does
poor
business
in
the
south
pa
side
tracks
a
circus
car
filled
with
creditors
a
performance
given
for
the
poor
fills
the
treasury
a
wild
west
man
buncoes
the
show
gee
but
this
show
has
been
up
against
it
the
last
week
we
have
made
a
paying
stand
anywhere
the
show
business
is
all
right
when
you
have
to
turn
people
away
or
let
them
in
on
standing
room
then
you
can
snap
your
fingers
at
fate
and
drink
foolish
water
out
of
bottles
of
fizz
that
has
the
cork
trained
so
it
will
pop
out
clear
to
the
top
of
the
tent
and
make
a
noise
that
makes
you
think
you
own
the
earth
but
when
you
strike
the
southern
country
where
the
white
men
have
not
sold
their
cotton
and
the
negroes
have
not
been
paid
for
picking
it
the
audience
looks
like
a
political
caucus
in
an
off
year
when
there
is
nobody
with
money
enough
to
stimulate
the
voters
when
the
audiences
are
small
and
half
the
people
in
attendance
get
in
on
passes
and
you
ca
pay
the
help
regularly
but
have
to
stand
them
off
with
promises
you
are
liable
to
have
a
strike
any
minute
the
people
you
owe
for
hotel
bills
and
horse
feed
and
supplies
follow
you
from
one
town
to
another
threatening
to
attach
the
ticket
wagon
and
levy
on
the
animals
it
takes
diplomacy
and
unadulterated
gall
to
run
a
show
we
are
playing
now
to
get
back
into
the
northern
states
but
we
have
to
leave
an
animal
of
some
kind
in
the
hands
of
a
sheriff
every
day
which
has
been
all
right
so
far
we
have
steered
the
sheriffs
on
to
elephants
that
have
corns
so
they
are
no
good
except
to
eat
one
zebra
that
was
made
up
by
a
painter
who
painted
stripes
on
a
white
mule
and
one
lion
that
was
so
old
he
will
never
sell
at
forced
sale
for
enough
to
pay
for
the
beef
tea
the
sheriff
will
have
to
feed
him
when
creditors
in
a
town
get
too
mad
and
threaten
to
attach
things
we
invite
them
to
go
along
with
us
for
a
few
days
and
get
their
money
when
we
strike
a
paying
stand
and
we
agree
to
furnish
them
a
pullman
car
and
all
they
can
eat
that
is
rather
tempting
to
country
people
so
we
had
a
full
car
load
of
creditors
with
us
for
a
week
and
we
gave
them
plenty
to
drink
so
they
had
the
time
of
their
lives
but
they
did
get
their
money
after
going
with
us
all
through
georgia
they
held
an
indignation
meeting
in
the
car
and
between
high
balls
and
cheese
sandwiches
they
got
sleepy
and
we
side
tracked
their
car
in
the
woods
at
a
station
in
mississippi
where
there
was
a
post
office
saw
mill
and
a
cotton
gin
i
guess
they
are
there
yet
unless
pullman
lost
car
experts
have
found
the
car
and
driven
them
out
with
fire
extinguishers
pa
came
pretty
near
being
left
in
that
car
with
the
creditors
in
mississippi
he
was
helping
to
entertain
the
guests
and
jollying
them
up
to
believe
they
would
get
their
money
when
we
got
to
memphis
the
next
day
when
he
noticed
the
car
had
been
sidetracked
and
he
knew
that
was
the
way
we
were
going
to
dispose
of
the
creditors
he
thought
some
one
would
tell
him
when
to
get
off
but
he
was
sitting
up
with
a
landlady
from
some
place
in
georgia
that
we
owed
a
lot
of
money
for
feeding
the
freaks
and
she
was
threatening
that
if
she
did
get
her
money
she
would
have
the
heart
blood
of
some
one
so
pa
was
afraid
to
leave
for
fear
she
would
stab
him
but
when
the
car
stopped
on
the
siding
pa
took
off
his
coat
and
hat
and
yawned
and
said
he
guessed
he
would
turn
in
and
she
let
him
go
to
his
berth
and
he
got
out
on
the
platform
and
just
then
the
second
section
of
our
train
came
along
and
stopped
for
water
and
pa
crawled
into
an
animal
car
and
laid
down
in
the
straw
with
the
sacred
cow
she
bellowed
all
night
the
sacred
bull
her
husband
had
been
attached
for
debt
at
vicksburg
but
when
pa
got
in
the
car
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
humped
his
shoulders
up
on
account
of
the
cold
the
cow
thought
maybe
she
had
been
unnecessarily
alarmed
and
maybe
pa
was
her
husband
so
she
quit
bellowing
and
laid
down
and
chewed
her
cud
till
daylight
then
when
she
saw
that
pa
was
another
person
she
got
mad
and
chased
him
up
into
the
rafters
of
the
car
and
he
had
to
ride
there
until
the
train
got
to
memphis
the
hands
rescued
pa
but
he
got
away
from
the
creditors
all
right
illustration
the
sacred
cow
chased
pa
up
into
the
rafters
of
the
car
we
made
a
new
lot
of
creditors
at
memphis
and
they
proposed
to
go
along
with
us
but
we
shook
them
off
gee
but
we
made
a
killing
in
memphis
and
do
you
forget
it
we
had
handbills
on
all
the
wagons
in
the
parade
telling
the
people
that
the
proceeds
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
performance
would
be
given
to
deserving
persons
in
charity
and
the
intention
was
to
use
the
money
to
pay
off
the
hands
my
but
how
the
people
turned
out
the
tents
were
all
full
and
we
had
more
money
than
we
have
had
in
a
month
before
and
after
the
performance
at
night
the
mayor
and
some
prominent
citizens
waited
on
the
management
and
asked
when
and
where
we
were
going
to
distribute
the
money
to
the
deserving
persons
the
managers
appointed
pa
to
stand
off
the
committee
pa
said
he
had
noticed
in
walking
about
the
city
a
beautiful
park
in
the
center
of
the
town
and
he
told
the
committee
that
his
idea
was
to
have
the
deserving
people
gather
at
the
park
the
next
morning
which
was
sunday
and
wait
there
until
the
managers
of
the
show
could
count
the
money
and
prepare
to
distribute
it
honestly
and
impartially
with
the
advice
of
the
local
committee
that
seemed
all
right
and
the
committee
notified
the
citizens
to
meet
in
the
park
at
nine
the
next
morning
and
receive
the
money
the
citizens
had
so
kindly
contributed
to
such
a
noble
cause
and
they
went
away
our
show
has
got
out
of
a
good
many
tight
places
but
we
never
got
out
of
a
town
so
quietly
and
unostentatiously
as
we
got
out
of
memphis
during
that
early
sunday
morning
there
was
not
noise
enough
made
getting
our
stuff
to
the
train
to
wake
up
a
policeman
and
before
daylight
the
different
sections
of
the
train
had
crossed
the
big
bridge
into
arkansas
and
were
on
the
way
to
the
indian
territory
pa
and
the
other
managers
were
on
the
platform
of
the
last
car
of
the
last
section
as
it
pulled
out
across
the
river
at
daylight
and
even
that
early
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
colored
population
of
memphis
was
on
the
way
to
the
park
to
secure
good
positions
so
they
could
receive
their
share
of
the
money
as
the
train
got
to
the
middle
of
the
river
and
safe
into
arkansas
the
whole
management
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
the
boss
canvasman
said
it
is
like
getting
money
from
home
and
pa
said
it
is
like
taking
money
from
the
tin
cup
of
a
blind
organ
grinder
and
the
treasurer
of
the
show
said
as
he
put
the
day
receipts
in
the
safe
in
the
business
car
it
looks
good
to
me
then
they
all
turned
in
to
sleep
the
happy
hours
away
that
beautiful
sunday
on
the
way
to
indian
territory
and
oklahoma
well
sir
you
can
never
make
me
believe
that
money
obtained
dishonestly
will
stay
by
a
person
or
do
him
any
good
and
that
was
demonstrated
in
the
case
of
our
show
the
next
day
we
got
acquainted
with
an
old
showman
who
was
out
of
luck
who
used
to
run
a
wild
west
show
but
got
busted
up
and
as
he
did
care
where
he
went
we
took
him
with
us
on
the
train
and
all
day
sunday
he
talked
about
his
show
experiences
and
finally
he
said
if
we
had
any
horses
with
our
show
that
could
run
races
we
could
make
a
barrel
of
money
at
guthrie
where
we
were
to
make
our
next
stand
he
said
the
indians
and
half
breeds
all
had
indian
ponies
that
they
thought
could
beat
any
horses
that
ever
wore
shoes
and
that
they
would
bet
every
cent
they
had
on
their
ponies
and
as
they
had
just
been
paid
their
annuities
by
the
government
they
had
money
in
bales
and
we
could
get
it
all
if
we
had
horses
that
were
any
good
and
money
to
back
them
his
idea
was
to
give
out
that
owing
to
some
accident
we
could
not
give
an
afternoon
performance
and
just
get
out
the
horses
and
bet
the
indians
to
a
standstill
and
win
all
their
money
and
give
a
free
evening
show
as
a
sort
of
consolation
to
the
indians
well
it
looked
good
to
pa
and
he
talked
to
the
other
managers
and
the
result
was
when
we
got
to
guthrie
we
had
made
up
our
minds
that
as
money
was
what
we
were
after
the
easiest
way
was
to
get
it
by
racing
our
horses
so
when
we
got
settled
in
guthrie
and
got
the
tent
up
we
announced
that
part
of
the
show
was
in
a
wreck
down
the
road
in
arkansas
and
we
should
have
to
abandon
the
afternoon
performance
but
in
the
meantime
there
would
be
a
little
horse
racing
on
the
side
if
anybody
in
oklahoma
had
any
horses
they
thought
could
run
some
well
i
thought
there
were
indians
and
ponies
and
squaws
enough
before
the
announcement
was
made
but
in
less
than
two
hours
more
than
a
thousand
ponies
were
being
brought
in
and
we
got
our
chariot
racers
and
our
bareback
hippodrome
horses
and
they
were
being
led
around
and
admired
and
we
all
laughed
at
the
little
runts
of
indian
ponies
and
the
indians
got
mad
and
backed
their
ponies
pretty
soon
the
races
began
in
the
vacant
lot
just
outside
the
town
the
old
showman
we
had
brought
up
from
memphis
was
made
master
of
ceremonies
he
could
talk
choctaw
and
comanche
and
other
indian
jargon
and
things
got
busy
the
indians
would
run
their
ponies
more
than
an
eighth
of
a
mile
or
a
quarter
and
we
consented
because
the
poor
little
things
did
look
as
though
they
could
run
a
block
they
were
so
thin
and
sleepy
pa
was
afraid
the
humane
society
would
have
us
arrested
for
cruelty
to
animals
all
our
fellows
were
provided
with
money
and
they
flashed
rolls
of
bills
in
the
faces
of
the
indians
and
finally
indian
would
reach
down
under
his
clothes
and
pull
out
a
roll
and
wet
his
thumb
and
peel
off
big
bills
and
before
we
knew
it
we
were
investing
a
fortune
in
the
racing
game
then
the
racing
began
and
the
horses
were
sent
off
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
or
the
firing
of
a
pistol
i
was
given
some
money
to
bet
with
the
little
indians
pa
said
we
wanted
to
get
every
dollar
in
the
tribe
for
if
we
did
get
it
the
indians
would
spend
it
for
fire
water
the
first
race
was
between
one
of
our
best
runners
and
a
sleepy
little
spotted
pony
and
when
the
hat
was
dropped
the
pony
made
a
few
jumps
and
was
off
like
a
rabbit
and
our
horse
could
see
him
for
the
dust
and
our
horse
was
distanced
the
next
race
resulted
the
same
and
all
day
long
we
never
won
a
race
and
the
indians
took
our
money
and
put
it
in
their
pants
and
never
smiled
the
old
showman
we
had
befriended
seemed
crushed
illustration
the
pony
was
off
like
a
rabbit
when
our
money
was
nearly
all
gone
to
the
confounded
indians
and
the
sun
was
going
down
he
went
up
to
pa
and
said
uncle
what
does
this
all
mean
i
thought
your
horses
could
run
pa
said
damfino
i
never
was
no
horse
racer
nohow
when
our
money
was
all
gone
and
our
horses
were
nearly
dead
from
fatigue
the
managers
all
got
together
in
the
big
tent
for
a
consultation
on
finances
and
it
was
the
saddest
sight
i
ever
saw
pa
tried
to
be
cheerful
and
he
said
well
we
will
give
the
evening
performance
and
when
the
indians
are
all
in
the
tent
we
can
turn
out
the
lights
and
turn
the
boys
loose
on
them
and
maybe
they
will
find
some
of
the
money
in
their
breech
clouts
you
do
mean
to
rob
them
do
you
said
the
boss
canvasman
and
pa
said
no
no
far
from
it
we
will
borrow
it
of
them
it
is
no
harm
to
borrow
from
an
indian
just
then
the
treasurer
came
in
with
an
empty
tin
box
he
had
carried
the
money
out
in
and
he
said
there
would
be
no
use
of
having
an
evening
performance
the
indians
had
taken
their
ponies
and
squaws
and
money
and
gone
towards
the
setting
sun
and
pa
said
where
is
that
old
showman
and
the
treasurer
said
he
has
gone
with
them
he
is
their
legal
adviser
and
went
down
to
memphis
to
rope
us
into
the
game
chapter
xxiii
the
circus
has
bad
luck
in
indian
territory
a
herd
of
animals
turned
out
to
graze
is
stampeded
by
indians
they
go
dashing
over
the
plains
and
the
circus
tent
follows
picked
up
by
a
cyclone
no
more
horse
racing
for
this
circus
the
managers
held
a
meeting
at
guthrie
after
we
had
lost
our
money
horse
racing
with
the
indians
and
pa
said
the
consensus
of
opinion
was
that
we
better
stick
to
the
legitimate
show
business
and
not
try
to
work
in
any
side
lines
pa
says
he
made
a
speech
at
the
managers
meeting
in
which
he
showed
that
the
business
man
who
attended
strictly
to
the
business
which
he
knew
all
about
would
make
money
while
the
man
who
knew
about
dry
goods
but
worked
in
a
millinery
store
or
a
stock
of
tinware
got
it
in
the
neck
he
would
either
get
stuck
on
the
head
milliner
or
buy
a
stock
of
tinware
that
would
not
hold
water
so
a
resolution
was
passed
to
the
effect
that
hereafter
no
temptation
could
be
great
enough
to
get
our
show
to
go
into
anything
outside
of
the
business
no
matter
how
good
it
looked
as
a
affair
so
we
gathered
up
our
show
and
played
a
whole
week
in
oklahoma
and
had
full
houses
all
the
time
and
made
money
enough
to
redeem
our
animals
that
had
been
attached
by
creditors
we
have
paid
up
our
debts
and
we
got
out
of
oklahoma
with
flying
colors
if
we
had
gone
right
on
to
kansas
we
would
have
shown
sense
but
some
cowboys
from
the
indian
territory
told
pa
and
the
other
managers
that
if
we
would
take
the
show
to
the
indian
territory
we
could
get
cars
enough
to
haul
the
money
away
as
the
indians
had
got
and
carrying
the
money
they
had
made
grazing
cattle
and
the
territory
was
full
of
cowboys
that
had
money
to
burn
and
they
seen
a
circus
since
the
war
well
it
seemed
a
shame
to
go
by
the
indian
territory
and
allow
those
poor
indians
to
break
their
backs
carrying
money
around
and
so
we
sent
a
carload
of
bill
pasters
into
the
territory
and
billed
towns
that
would
hold
us
about
a
week
and
we
figured
that
we
would
clean
up
enough
money
to
last
us
all
a
i
wish
i
did
have
to
write
about
the
result
we
are
broke
up
so
we
ca
look
pleasant
to
have
our
pictures
taken
it
was
a
bright
beautiful
sunday
morning
that
we
arrived
at
muskoka
and
soon
after
daylight
we
had
our
tents
pitched
as
we
had
all
day
sunday
to
rest
pa
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
take
all
our
animals
that
eat
grass
out
on
the
grazing
ground
on
the
edge
of
the
town
and
let
them
fill
up
on
the
nice
blue
grass
that
was
all
over
the
country
so
after
breakfast
we
detailed
men
to
take
charge
of
the
different
animals
and
herd
them
out
in
the
tall
grass
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
to
see
those
rare
animals
gathered
from
all
over
the
world
eating
grass
together
in
perfect
peace
in
this
new
country
the
animals
that
we
thought
would
stand
without
hitching
like
the
elephants
were
cared
for
by
their
attendants
but
the
animals
that
might
wander
from
their
own
fireside
were
picketed
out
or
held
by
long
ropes
the
deer
the
buffalo
the
zebras
the
sacred
cattle
the
elk
the
yaks
the
camels
and
that
kind
were
tied
with
long
lariats
and
held
by
the
men
detailed
by
the
managers
for
a
couple
of
hours
the
animals
just
gorged
themselves
after
they
had
kicked
up
their
heels
a
spell
and
rolled
in
the
grass
then
one
of
the
elephants
got
up
on
his
hind
feet
and
held
up
two
toes
like
boys
in
school
hold
up
two
fingers
when
they
want
to
go
in
swimming
and
the
elephant
started
for
a
creek
and
went
in
the
water
and
the
whole
herd
followed
and
they
spattered
each
other
and
ducked
and
rolled
around
just
like
school
boys
the
whole
population
of
the
town
whites
and
indians
came
to
the
bank
of
the
river
to
watch
the
fun
pa
was
holding
his
elk
by
a
rope
and
one
of
the
managers
had
a
rope
around
the
neck
of
a
giraffe
the
treasurer
and
the
ticket
taker
was
leading
the
zebras
and
everybody
was
busy
with
some
kind
of
animal
and
i
had
a
rope
around
an
antelope
and
some
of
our
men
on
horseback
were
herding
the
buffaloes
it
did
seem
as
though
anything
wrong
could
happen
the
elephants
would
come
out
of
the
creek
so
the
boss
canvasman
went
over
to
where
there
were
about
cowboys
and
indians
on
horseback
and
asked
them
to
ride
into
the
creek
and
drive
the
elephants
out
where
the
rest
of
the
animals
were
on
the
prairie
gee
but
that
was
the
greatest
mistake
he
could
have
made
the
men
on
horseback
did
want
any
better
fun
so
they
made
a
charge
in
line
of
battle
just
like
sheridan
cavalry
down
the
bank
into
the
creek
yelling
and
waving
lariat
ropes
and
snapping
whips
and
the
elephants
got
out
of
that
creek
in
a
hurry
the
cowboys
threw
lassoes
over
the
hind
feet
of
the
elephants
and
tried
to
hold
them
and
the
elephants
bellowed
and
dragged
the
cowboys
and
their
ponies
right
amongst
the
other
animals
and
in
about
a
minute
as
the
boss
canvasman
said
when
he
came
to
and
they
were
picking
the
cactus
thorns
out
of
him
hell
was
just
plumb
out
for
noon
the
buffaloes
smelled
the
indians
and
they
started
to
stampede
like
they
used
to
do
when
they
lived
on
the
plains
and
all
the
animals
followed
dragging
the
men
who
had
hold
of
their
ropes
and
away
we
all
went
over
a
rise
of
ground
the
zebras
in
the
lead
and
the
elephants
fetching
up
the
rear
the
cowboys
and
indians
behind
yelling
and
and
more
than
indian
dogs
barking
well
pa
was
the
foolishest
man
in
the
lot
he
had
tied
the
lariat
rope
that
he
held
his
elk
by
around
his
belt
and
when
the
elk
went
over
the
hill
pa
was
only
hitting
the
high
places
and
he
was
yelling
for
me
to
head
off
his
elk
but
i
was
busy
trying
to
keep
up
with
my
antelope
which
was
scared
worse
than
any
animal
in
the
race
when
the
antelope
and
i
overtook
the
boss
canvasman
who
was
digging
his
heels
into
the
ground
trying
to
hold
his
zebra
i
thought
it
was
a
good
time
to
say
something
pleasant
so
i
said
this
is
a
lovely
country
we
are
passing
through
but
i
never
heard
his
reply
just
then
the
zebra
jumped
over
a
big
cactus
and
the
boss
canvasman
went
into
it
and
stayed
there
yelling
for
a
piece
of
ice
while
the
zebras
that
were
dragging
the
treasurer
and
the
ticket
taker
passed
us
i
yelled
to
the
treasurer
and
told
him
i
should
have
to
have
my
salary
raised
if
i
was
expected
to
keep
up
with
my
antelope
but
he
told
me
where
to
go
to
get
an
increase
of
salary
some
place
in
arkansas
maybe
hot
springs
illustration
dad
was
only
hitting
the
high
places
illustration
the
boss
canvasman
went
into
a
cactus
then
my
antelope
heard
the
indians
and
cowboys
coming
behind
and
he
got
his
second
wind
and
i
never
did
touch
the
ground
no
more
and
i
must
have
looked
like
a
buzzard
sailing
through
the
air
when
my
antelope
got
up
to
where
pa
was
trying
to
keep
up
with
his
elk
i
told
pa
he
better
let
go
his
elk
and
get
the
cowboys
and
indians
to
ride
around
ahead
of
the
stampede
and
head
them
off
pa
said
he
could
let
go
of
his
elk
the
rope
was
tied
to
his
belt
but
for
me
to
hit
the
ground
somewhere
ahead
and
let
go
of
that
jack
rabbit
i
was
chasing
and
tell
the
cowboys
to
head
off
the
stampede
so
when
i
lit
again
i
let
go
the
rope
and
the
antelope
got
ahead
of
everything
and
i
wished
i
had
bet
on
him
when
the
cowboys
and
indians
got
up
to
me
i
delivered
the
message
from
pa
and
they
divided
and
went
around
the
flanks
of
the
stampeders
and
in
another
mile
they
headed
them
off
in
a
nice
pasture
and
kept
riding
around
the
animals
so
they
could
get
away
they
soon
had
the
whole
bunch
under
control
and
we
all
got
together
to
see
if
anybody
was
hurt
well
pa
was
the
worst
sight
of
all
if
his
belt
had
broke
he
never
would
have
lost
his
pants
more
than
a
million
cactus
thorns
had
gone
through
and
pinned
them
on
we
had
to
cut
them
off
and
pull
out
the
thorns
with
pincers
one
at
a
time
and
pa
yelling
murder
for
every
thorn
the
boss
canvasman
was
in
the
same
fix
and
everybody
that
tried
to
hold
an
animal
was
pinned
together
with
thorns
and
they
had
gravel
up
their
trousers
from
sticking
their
heels
into
the
soil
everybody
was
mad
and
they
threatened
to
lynch
pa
when
they
got
back
to
the
tent
for
suggesting
letting
the
animals
out
to
graze
we
started
back
to
town
the
cowboys
and
indians
driving
the
animals
and
the
zebras
and
giraffes
kicking
up
and
acting
as
though
they
had
got
out
of
school
on
account
of
the
death
of
a
dear
teacher
like
schoolboys
before
we
got
to
town
a
wind
came
up
so
strong
that
we
had
to
walk
edgewise
to
go
against
it
and
finally
we
met
the
tent
coming
out
to
meet
us
a
cyclone
had
taken
it
bodily
and
was
blowing
it
all
over
the
prairie
and
when
we
got
to
town
the
animals
in
the
cages
that
ca
eat
grass
were
having
an
indignation
meeting
and
howling
awful
pa
was
the
first
man
to
get
back
to
the
lot
and
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
he
better
do
and
i
told
him
he
better
get
in
the
porcupine
cage
he
looked
with
the
cactus
thorns
sticking
out
of
him
like
the
father
of
all
porcupines
he
said
i
thought
i
was
smart
and
he
asked
me
if
i
was
hurt
any
and
i
told
him
all
i
could
find
was
a
stone
bruise
on
my
spine
where
i
struck
a
prairie
dog
house
well
we
got
the
animals
into
a
livery
barn
and
it
took
us
almost
the
whole
week
to
have
the
tent
hauled
back
and
sewed
together
and
we
had
to
pay
the
cowboys
and
indians
more
than
the
animals
were
worth
to
bring
them
back
and
let
them
into
the
show
free
the
managers
had
a
meeting
and
resolved
to
get
out
of
the
indian
territory
and
into
kansas
just
as
quick
as
possible
chapter
xxiv
pa
is
sent
to
a
hospital
to
recuperate
the
bad
boy
discourages
other
boys
from
running
away
with
the
circus
he
makes
them
water
the
camels
curry
the
hyenas
and
put
insect
powder
on
the
buffaloes
this
is
the
first
time
since
we
started
out
with
the
circus
in
the
spring
that
pa
and
i
have
not
been
two
johnnies
on
the
spot
ready
for
anything
that
the
managers
told
us
to
do
oklahoma
though
and
the
indian
territory
have
been
too
much
for
pa
and
they
sent
him
on
to
kansas
city
to
recuperate
in
a
hospital
for
a
week
while
the
show
does
kansas
to
a
finish
and
makes
a
triumphal
entry
into
missouri
i
wonder
how
the
show
will
get
along
without
us
for
a
week
they
sentenced
me
to
go
along
with
pa
so
i
could
be
handy
to
hold
his
hands
when
the
doctors
are
pulling
cactus
needles
out
of
his
hide
i
guess
pa
was
willing
enough
to
jump
kansas
in
the
night
from
what
he
told
us
once
he
said
when
he
was
a
young
man
he
and
a
railroad
brakeman
got
busted
at
topeka
and
they
had
an
order
book
printed
and
went
all
over
kansas
taking
orders
for
osier
willows
which
they
warranted
to
grow
so
high
in
two
years
they
would
make
fences
for
the
farms
that
no
animals
or
blizzards
could
get
over
or
through
and
make
shade
for
the
houses
and
the
whole
farm
it
was
the
year
when
the
osier
willow
craze
was
on
and
every
farmer
on
the
plains
wanted
to
transform
his
prairie
into
a
forest
pa
says
the
farmers
fought
with
each
other
to
sign
orders
and
some
paid
in
advance
so
as
to
get
the
willow
cuttings
in
a
hurry
well
pa
and
the
railroad
man
canvassed
kansas
and
sold
more
than
forty
thousand
millions
of
osier
willow
cuttings
and
put
in
the
whole
winter
in
the
spring
when
it
was
time
to
deliver
the
goods
they
went
into
the
river
bottoms
and
cut
a
whole
lot
of
pussy
willow
cuttings
delivered
them
to
the
farmers
and
got
their
money
and
went
away
when
the
pussy
willow
cuttings
died
in
their
tracks
or
grew
up
just
plain
pussy
willows
that
never
got
high
enough
to
hide
a
jack
rabbit
the
farmers
of
kansas
loaded
their
guns
and
waited
for
pa
and
the
brakeman
to
come
back
to
kansas
but
they
never
went
back
the
brakeman
became
president
of
a
great
railroad
but
when
he
has
to
go
across
the
continent
in
his
special
car
he
dodges
kansas
and
goes
across
by
the
northern
or
southern
route
pa
has
so
far
dodged
the
farmers
but
money
would
have
hired
him
to
stay
with
the
circus
and
meet
those
farmers
that
they
sold
the
willow
gold
bricks
to
and
yet
when
i
bunco
anybody
around
the
show
pa
takes
me
one
side
and
tells
me
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
and
to
never
lie
my
character
as
a
man
will
depend
on
the
start
i
make
as
a
boy
he
do
want
me
to
go
through
life
regretting
the
past
and
being
afraid
of
the
cars
for
fear
some
act
of
my
younger
days
will
become
known
and
queer
me
i
guess
pa
knows
how
it
is
hisself
well
if
there
is
one
thing
i
am
proud
of
it
is
that
i
have
always
been
good
when
i
grow
up
to
be
a
man
prosperous
in
business
and
belonging
to
a
church
and
married
and
have
children
growing
up
around
me
i
can
put
on
an
innocent
face
and
a
bold
front
and
point
to
my
past
with
pride
if
i
should
go
to
live
among
strangers
where
nobody
took
the
papers
and
the
people
were
not
on
to
me
pa
says
as
long
as
your
conscience
is
clear
and
your
pores
open
life
is
one
glad
sweet
song
well
i
do
know
but
if
pa
conscience
is
clear
he
must
have
strained
it
the
way
they
do
rain
water
to
get
the
wigglers
out
or
else
he
has
used
an
egg
to
settle
his
conscience
the
way
they
settle
coffee
if
his
pores
are
open
he
has
opened
them
in
the
old
way
with
a
corkscrew
but
with
all
i
have
had
to
contend
with
in
the
way
of
a
frightful
example
from
pa
i
am
not
so
worse
how
many
boys
of
my
age
do
you
suppose
could
put
in
a
season
with
a
circus
and
have
all
the
facilities
i
have
had
to
go
wrong
and
come
out
as
well
as
i
have
the
way
the
freaks
just
doted
on
me
would
have
turned
the
heads
of
most
boys
but
when
i
found
out
that
all
of
them
from
the
fat
woman
and
the
bearded
woman
to
the
trapeze
performers
ate
onions
three
times
a
day
i
said
nay
nay
hennery
will
camp
with
the
animals
whose
smell
is
natural
and
not
acquired
say
do
you
know
i
have
saved
hundred
of
boys
this
summer
from
ruin
in
every
town
there
are
lots
of
boys
who
want
to
run
away
from
home
and
go
off
with
a
circus
and
i
belonged
to
the
show
they
all
came
to
me
and
pa
appointed
me
to
discourage
the
boys
and
drive
them
away
from
the
show
i
know
in
virginia
all
the
boys
wanted
to
run
away
and
but
for
me
the
state
would
have
boys
enough
to
grow
up
and
shoot
the
negroes
but
when
i
found
boys
who
wanted
to
skip
away
from
home
i
would
give
them
a
job
and
they
would
have
slept
in
the
straw
with
the
horses
and
eaten
at
the
second
table
after
the
negroes
had
been
fed
if
they
could
only
shake
their
comfortable
homes
and
loving
friends
and
join
a
traveling
circus
well
i
always
gave
such
boys
a
job
watering
the
camels
and
after
they
had
carried
water
from
daylight
till
dark
and
had
seen
it
disappear
down
a
camel
and
the
camels
grumbling
because
they
did
bring
water
faster
the
boys
would
ask
me
how
long
it
look
to
fill
up
a
camel
anyway
i
would
tell
them
that
if
they
kept
right
at
work
the
camels
ought
to
be
filled
up
full
along
in
the
fall
the
boys
would
reluctantly
resign
our
camels
have
been
the
making
of
hundreds
of
boys
by
their
capacity
to
hold
water
one
boy
at
richmond
got
it
on
me
by
getting
a
section
of
fire
hose
and
hitching
it
to
a
hydrant
and
letting
the
water
run
into
a
trough
at
the
camel
stand
in
the
menagerie
and
before
i
knew
it
the
camels
had
filled
up
until
they
were
swelled
four
times
as
big
as
they
ought
to
be
then
they
laid
down
and
march
in
the
grand
entree
and
pa
sent
for
a
plumber
to
have
the
camels
fixed
with
faucets
that
boy
was
a
genius
and
we
kept
him
and
put
him
into
the
lemonade
privilege
you
can
fill
a
camel
with
a
hydrant
all
right
but
if
you
bring
the
water
in
pails
he
will
beat
the
game
i
remember
one
boy
at
wilmington
who
insisted
on
going
along
with
the
show
his
mother
made
him
work
after
school
and
my
heart
was
touched
i
know
how
a
boy
hates
to
work
after
school
so
i
gave
him
a
job
sprinkling
insect
powder
on
the
buffaloes
that
were
scratching
themselves
against
the
tent
poles
so
much
that
i
felt
they
had
something
alive
concealed
about
their
persons
that
boy
started
in
with
his
can
of
insect
powder
on
a
buffalo
calf
and
then
he
filled
the
cow
hair
full
of
the
powder
and
when
he
started
on
the
bull
the
bull
took
a
sniff
of
the
powder
on
the
cow
and
got
it
up
his
nose
and
he
held
his
head
up
kind
of
scared
like
and
turned
his
upper
lip
out
and
began
to
paw
the
ground
then
he
made
a
charge
on
that
boy
and
tossed
him
through
the
tent
and
i
looked
through
the
hole
and
saw
the
boy
scratching
gravel
towards
town
if
he
is
not
running
yet
he
is
probably
doing
chores
for
his
mother
both
before
and
after
school
illustration
the
bull
tossed
the
boy
through
the
tent
i
have
discouraged
most
of
the
boys
who
wanted
to
run
away
and
go
with
the
show
by
giving
them
a
curry
comb
and
brush
and
telling
them
they
could
have
a
permanent
job
currying
off
the
hyenas
most
boys
would
look
sort
of
dubious
about
it
but
would
think
it
was
up
to
them
to
be
game
and
they
would
take
the
curry
comb
and
brush
all
right
i
would
take
them
to
the
cage
and
tell
them
to
just
talk
soothing
to
the
hyenas
through
the
bars
and
when
the
hyenas
began
to
get
tame
and
act
as
though
it
would
give
them
pleasure
to
be
curried
off
and
laid
down
and
rolled
over
and
purred
like
a
cat
that
wanted
to
be
scratched
and
acted
as
though
they
would
eat
out
of
one
hand
the
boys
might
call
me
and
i
would
have
the
cage
opened
and
they
could
go
in
and
curry
them
off
well
it
would
kill
you
dead
to
see
a
fool
boy
side
up
to
a
hyena
cage
and
try
to
hypnotize
a
hyena
by
kind
words
and
a
pious
example
saying
soothing
words
like
soo
boss
or
o
come
off
now
and
be
a
good
fellow
and
see
the
hyena
snarl
and
show
his
teeth
like
an
anarchist
that
a
might
try
to
tame
so
he
would
take
a
roll
of
money
out
of
his
hand
without
biting
the
hand
i
have
had
boys
stand
in
front
of
a
hyena
cage
with
a
and
brush
all
day
trying
to
get
on
good
terms
with
the
hyenas
and
occasionally
the
hyenas
would
forget
to
snarl
and
the
boy
would
think
the
animals
were
beginning
to
weaken
and
the
boy
would
work
up
closer
to
the
cage
and
say
pretty
pussy
and
hold
out
his
hand
and
say
good
fellow
then
the
whole
cageful
of
hyenas
would
make
a
rush
for
him
howling
snapping
and
scratching
with
their
bristles
up
and
the
boy
would
fall
backwards
over
a
sacred
cow
about
this
time
i
would
come
along
and
ask
the
boy
if
he
had
got
the
hyenas
curried
if
he
had
i
wanted
him
to
curry
the
grave
robbers
the
jackals
then
the
boy
would
reluctantly
give
up
his
tools
and
say
if
i
wanted
the
hyenas
and
jackals
curried
off
i
could
do
it
myself
i
would
tell
them
they
would
never
do
for
the
circus
business
faint
heart
never
won
fair
hyena
then
they
would
go
home
and
sell
their
mother
copper
boiler
to
get
money
to
pay
their
way
in
the
show
gee
but
i
have
saved
lots
of
boys
from
a
circus
fate
pa
has
an
awful
time
in
the
hospital
twice
a
day
the
doctors
strip
him
and
pull
a
mess
of
cactus
thorns
out
of
him
and
he
yells
and
do
talk
very
pious
the
doctor
told
me
i
must
try
and
think
of
something
to
divert
pa
mind
from
his
suffering
so
i
got
some
telegraph
blanks
and
envelopes
and
i
have
written
messages
from
the
show
managers
twice
a
day
the
morning
message
would
tell
about
the
business
of
the
day
before
and
how
they
missed
then
i
would
add
something
like
this
the
farmers
around
olathe
are
all
inquiring
for
you
or
the
farmers
around
topeka
wish
you
were
here
they
want
to
give
you
a
reception
or
about
farmers
at
parsons
think
we
ought
to
let
them
in
free
on
account
of
being
old
friends
of
yours
the
last
one
broke
pa
all
up
the
message
said
many
farmers
from
atchison
are
going
to
come
with
us
to
kansas
city
to
confer
with
you
on
an
old
matter
of
business
pa
jumped
like
a
box
car
off
the
track
and
wanted
the
doctors
to
send
him
to
a
hospital
at
louis
and
he
told
the
doctors
the
reason
but
they
cheered
him
up
by
saying
that
if
any
mob
came
to
the
hospital
after
him
they
would
hide
him
in
the
pickling
vat
and
make
the
mob
believe
he
was
dead
that
is
the
way
it
stands
now
but
pa
is
not
so
darn
happy
as
i
have
seen
him
though
i
try
to
do
all
i
can
to
keep
his
mind
off
his
trouble
i
tell
him
as
long
as
his
conscience
is
clear
he
is
all
right
but
he
says
but
hennery
that
the
trouble
it
ai
clear
well
let
us
have
peace
at
any
price

breaks
in

drives
a
team
in
the
parade
the
freaks
have
a
narrow
escape
from
drowning
pa
is
stuck
on
the

i
do
not
know
what
there
is
about
a
zebra
unless
it
is
the
wail
paper
effects
of
his
exterior
decoration
that
should
make
a
man
leave
all
the
other
animals
and
cleave
unto
the
zebra
but
pa
has
been
putting
in
his
leisure
time
all
summer
breaking
the
zebras
to
harness
and
driving
them
single
and
double
in
the
ring
sundays
everybody
about
the
show
knew
pa
was
going
to
spring
some
surprise
on
us
i
have
tried
to
reason
pa
out
of
his
unnatural
infatuation
for
zebras
but
you
might
as
well
talk
to
a
rich
old
man
who
gets
stuck
on
a
chorus
girl
and
gives
her
all
his
money
and
has
to
go
and
live
at
the
poor
house
a
zebra
always
looks
to
me
like
a
joke
that
nature
has
played
who
but
nature
would
ever
think
of
laying
out
a
plan
for
a
zebra
and
painting
it
in
stripes
like
a
barber
pole
and
yet
we
must
admit
that
few
human
artists
could
paint
a
million
zebras
and
get
the
stripes
on
as
perfect
as
nature
does
with
her
eyes
shut
the
mule
and
the
zebra
are
distant
relatives
lots
of
mules
have
a
few
stripes
on
their
legs
but
the
zebra
is
the
eldest
son
who
is
aristocratic
and
inherits
the
stuff
while
the
mule
is
the
younger
son
who
never
gets
a
look
in
for
the
money
but
has
to
work
for
a
living
so
it
is
no
wonder
to
me
that
the
mule
kicks
the
zebra
is
the
dude
of
the
family
and
the
mule
looks
up
to
him
when
he
ought
to
kick
his
slats
in
and
rub
out
his
stripes
with
a
mule
shoe
eraser
while
pa
was
in
the
hospital
at
kansas
city
he
formed
a
plan
to
paralyze
the
town
by
driving
six
zebras
to
a
coach
in
the
parade
and
the
reporters
interviewed
pa
and
the
papers
were
full
of
it
and
the
people
were
wild
with
excitement
and
everybody
wanted
to
see
a
zebra
team
driven
by
alkali
ike
one
of
the
greatest
western
stage
drivers
that
was
ever
held
up
by
road
agents
pa
was
to
be
alkali
ike
the
show
struck
kansas
city
sunday
morning
and
the
management
was
scared
at
what
pa
had
advertised
to
do
and
they
all
wanted
to
call
off
the
zebra
stunt
but
pa
said
if
they
cut
it
out
the
people
would
mob
the
show
so
all
day
sunday
we
hooked
up
the
six
zebras
and
the
hands
led
them
around
the
tent
with
a
mule
with
a
bell
on
ridden
in
the
lead
they
seemed
to
go
pretty
well
but
i
could
see
pa
finish
when
he
got
out
on
the
streets
with
that
crazy
team
pa
wanted
all
the
freaks
to
ride
on
the
and
he
had
invited
nine
newspaper
fellows
to
ride
with
him
pa
thought
the
zebra
team
would
follow
the
bell
mule
ahead
like
a
borax
team
would
well
monday
morning
the
parade
started
and
along
about
the
middle
of
the
parade
just
ahead
of
the
calliope
was
pa
and
his
six
zebra
team
his
freaks
and
reporters
and
pa
handled
the
ribbons
like
a
pirate
the
fat
woman
sat
on
the
driver
seat
with
pa
for
ballast
and
the
rest
of
the
freaks
were
sandwiched
in
between
the
reporters
we
went
along
all
right
for
half
a
mile
the
circus
hands
walking
beside
the
zebras
to
kill
them
if
they
tried
to
jump
over
a
house
while
i
rode
the
bell
mule
if
i
had
been
planning
the
zebra
business
i
would
have
picked
out
a
level
town
to
try
it
on
but
kansas
city
is
all
hills
and
ravines
and
going
up
hill
the
zebras
had
to
be
pushed
by
a
couple
of
elephants
the
zebras
would
pull
the
load
and
going
down
hill
we
had
to
lock
the
wheels
and
slide
down
when
we
got
on
the
main
street
where
the
crowd
filled
both
sides
almost
up
to
the
team
and
the
people
began
to
cheer
the
zebras
began
to
waltz
and
kick
and
try
to
jump
over
each
other
but
the
hands
got
them
untangled
and
we
worried
along
though
pa
was
pale
and
looked
like
a
man
smoking
a
cigar
while
sitting
on
an
open
powder
keg
the
fat
woman
grabbed
pa
every
little
while
and
screamed
that
she
wanted
to
get
off
and
walk
but
pa
told
her
to
hush
up
and
try
to
be
a
man
well
as
we
were
going
down
hill
by
a
park
near
the
midland
hotel
that
confounded
calliope
had
got
right
up
behind
the
and
the
organist
cut
her
loose
with
the
tune
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
every
zebra
jumped
into
the
air
the
brake
footpiece
escaped
pa
foot
and
the
run
on
to
the
heels
of
the
wheel
zebras
and
it
was
all
off
there
never
was
such
a
runaway
since
the
days
of
ben
hur
pa
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
make
the
fat
lady
get
down
off
the
seat
and
he
put
his
feet
on
her
to
hold
her
down
the
crowd
yelled
and
our
zebras
run
into
the
cage
ahead
containing
the
behemoth
of
holy
writ
and
knocked
off
a
hind
wheel
and
every
wagon
ahead
was
either
tipped
over
or
disabled
the
people
fairly
went
wild
thinking
the
runaway
was
a
part
of
the
show
the
giant
fainted
from
fright
he
always
was
a
coward
the
bearded
woman
threw
her
arms
around
a
reporter
and
scratched
his
face
with
her
whiskers
while
the
circassian
girl
got
her
white
wig
caught
in
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
lost
it
and
she
was
as
bald
as
an
ostrich
egg
pa
took
out
the
whip
and
larruped
the
zebras
to
put
some
new
stripes
on
them
illustration
there
never
was
such
a
runaway
since
the
days
of
when
we
passed
the
camels
they
thought
they
were
in
the
race
and
they
buckled
in
to
keep
up
and
the
chariot
horses
got
the
best
of
the
drivers
and
they
joined
in
my
mule
kept
up
all
right
and
we
went
down
the
hill
on
to
the
level
ground
that
runs
to
the
missouri
river
when
we
got
to
the
river
the
zebras
turned
short
and
tipped
the
over
into
the
water
and
the
whole
bunch
on
the
coach
was
floundering
in
the
muddy
water
but
there
happened
to
be
a
sandbar
under
the
water
so
nobody
was
drowned
though
we
had
to
bail
out
the
fat
woman
she
swallowed
so
much
of
the
muddy
river
the
giant
was
senseless
and
two
reporters
got
astride
of
him
thinking
it
was
a
rail
and
drifted
ashore
while
pa
laid
on
his
back
and
floated
like
a
duck
and
when
we
got
him
out
we
found
he
had
a
under
his
coat
and
he
said
he
put
it
on
because
he
had
a
hunch
that
those
zebras
would
make
for
running
water
if
they
ever
got
beyond
control
well
the
crowd
followed
down
to
the
river
and
everybody
was
rescued
and
the
rest
of
the
parade
went
over
the
route
and
in
the
afternoon
the
tent
was
so
full
there
were
thousands
standing
up
illustration
the
zebras
turned
short
and
tipped
the
over
into
the
water
when
pa
came
into
the
main
tent
with
the
zebras
in
the
grand
parade
around
the
ring
the
crowd
gave
him
three
cheers
which
probably
caused
the
management
to
refrain
from
discharging
him
on
the
spot
pa
is
like
a
cat
he
always
falls
on
his
feet
all
right
and
he
thinks
the
zebra
in
the
parade
was
the
feature
that
caused
the
crowd
to
visit
the
show
but
he
says
he
will
never
drive
zebras
again
on
account
of
the
excitement
the
fat
woman
talks
of
having
pa
arrested
for
breaking
one
of
her
ribs
when
he
held
her
down
with
his
feet
but
pa
says
his
feet
did
not
sink
into
her
more
than
a
foot
or
so
and
he
could
have
hit
a
rib
nohow
well
i
glad
to
be
back
in
the
show
there
is
more
going
on
than
there
was
in
the
hospital
where
i
put
in
a
week
while
the
doctors
were
pulling
the
cactus
pin
feathers
out
of
pa
that
grew
out
on
him
in
indian
territory
gee
but
if
i
had
to
leave
the
circus
business
and
go
back
to
school
i
know
i
should
die
of
lonesomeness
i
got
a
chance
to
talk
with
pa
at
supper
and
asked
him
if
he
was
really
crazy
as
the
hands
say
he
is
and
how
he
liked
zebras
anyway
and
he
said
hennery
zebras
are
just
people
they
stampede
just
like
politicians
and
bankers
and
business
men
generally
and
never
know
enough
to
let
well
enough
alone
the
mule
is
the
only
draft
animal
that
always
pulls
straight
and
gets
there
right
side
up
if
i
was
going
to
run
a
circus
for
easy
money
and
a
picnic
i
have
any
menagerie
connected
with
it
the
animals
make
more
trouble
than
all
the
rest
of
the
show
they
are
just
like
a
lot
of
children
in
a
reform
school
they
do
want
to
work
and
they
are
just
looking
for
a
chance
to
fight
when
your
back
is
turned
or
to
escape
they
do
know
where
they
would
go
if
they
did
escape
but
they
want
anybody
over
them
to
teach
them
morals
though
when
meal
time
comes
the
reform
school
boys
and
the
menagerie
animals
eat
like
tramps
because
the
food
is
so
good
and
then
kick
because
it
is
better
if
your
performers
in
the
circus
proper
do
not
suit
you
can
discharge
them
and
if
they
are
sick
you
can
leave
them
in
a
hospital
and
go
on
with
the
show
and
forget
about
them
until
they
show
up
in
a
week
or
two
pale
as
ghosts
and
weak
as
cats
and
demand
back
salary
but
your
animal
has
to
be
taken
along
and
petted
and
when
you
give
him
medicine
to
save
his
life
he
will
try
to
bite
your
hand
off
and
yet
you
ca
help
getting
stuck
on
the
animals
and
a
man
gets
stuck
on
the
kind
of
animal
that
is
most
like
him
the
grizzly
old
granger
who
never
buttons
the
collar
of
his
shirt
and
whose
apple
looks
like
a
hen
head
will
stay
by
the
camels
hours
at
a
time
the
pious
church
man
feels
at
home
among
the
sacred
cattle
the
holdup
man
will
linger
by
the
grizzly
bear
the
will
haunt
the
lions
den
the
garroter
will
gaze
lovingly
at
the
tigers
the
sneak
thief
seems
to
love
the
hyenas
and
the
big
game
hunters
watch
the
deer
and
elk
some
of
us
who
have
brains
love
the
monkeys
they
are
so
human

in
search

attractions
for
the
coming
season
well
missouri
is
the
state
to
teach
a
circus
humility
and
we
have
taken
the
degree
in
the
last
ten
days
it
has
rained
nine
days
and
a
half
out
of
a
possible
ten
days
and
the
mud
is
something
we
never
dreamed
of
before
the
wagons
have
been
mired
in
the
mud
on
the
way
from
the
train
to
the
lot
every
day
in
the
streets
of
cities
big
enough
to
have
street
cars
and
electric
lights
the
cities
have
one
or
two
main
streets
paved
but
the
rest
of
the
streets
are
just
virgin
soil
and
you
have
got
to
swim
to
get
to
the
paved
streets
when
you
start
away
for
the
lot
it
is
like
washington
crossing
the
delaware
and
yet
the
people
come
from
miles
around
to
see
the
show
and
everybody
rides
a
mule
that
can
wallow
in
the
mud
they
hitch
the
mules
to
fences
outside
the
tent
and
while
the
performance
is
going
on
the
mules
bray
in
concert
and
drown
the
band
pa
has
been
wild
ever
since
we
struck
missouri
and
no
wonder
everybody
seems
to
lay
everything
in
the
way
of
weather
on
him
every
place
we
show
the
lot
is
one
sea
of
mud
and
when
we
get
the
rings
made
they
seem
like
a
chain
of
lakes
and
in
galloping
around
the
rings
the
horses
splash
mud
and
water
clear
to
the
reserved
seats
the
riders
of
the
horses
have
to
come
out
in
rubber
hunting
boots
and
when
they
get
on
the
horses
we
have
to
pull
their
boots
off
and
hold
them
until
the
act
is
over
then
the
riders
sit
on
the
horses
and
pull
the
boots
on
and
get
down
in
the
mud
of
the
ring
and
bow
to
the
audience
the
woman
riders
are
the
worst
to
wear
rubber
boots
they
fall
down
in
the
mud
and
spoil
their
dresses
and
kick
scandalous
the
trapeze
performers
have
to
be
carried
out
of
the
dressing
room
on
stretchers
and
hoisted
up
to
the
net
they
ca
do
stunts
up
on
the
trapeze
with
wet
feet
and
we
have
worked
ourselves
to
death
getting
things
in
shape
the
confounded
elephants
just
glory
in
the
mud
and
the
minute
they
get
in
the
ring
they
all
lay
down
and
roll
in
the
mud
and
water
so
when
they
are
ready
to
do
their
act
they
look
like
walking
mud
pies
the
freaks
are
awful
to
handle
the
giant
being
the
only
one
that
can
wade
through
and
look
pleasant
and
the
fat
woman
would
make
you
weary
she
has
to
be
carried
back
and
forth
to
the
platform
by
half
a
force
of
hands
pa
has
had
shawl
straps
and
coffin
handles
fastened
to
her
clothes
so
there
will
be
something
to
grab
hold
of
to
move
her
around
i
do
think
that
another
year
we
will
have
any
fat
woman
pa
says
it
costs
more
to
get
this
female
from
one
place
to
another
than
all
the
rest
of
the
show
he
thinks
that
people
who
visit
the
show
do
care
much
about
a
fat
woman
anyway
but
just
guy
her
and
ask
her
what
kind
of
breakfast
food
she
lives
on
he
thinks
if
we
had
three
reasonably
fat
women
that
weighed
about
pounds
apiece
it
would
give
better
satisfaction
and
they
would
be
easier
to
handle
but
when
she
heard
what
pa
said
and
felt
that
she
was
going
to
be
shook
next
year
she
began
to
cry
and
it
was
like
turning
on
water
in
a
bathtub
pa
had
to
pet
her
and
then
the
bearded
woman
got
jealous
at
jefferson
city
there
came
a
cold
wave
and
everything
was
froze
stiff
and
you
could
skate
in
the
rings
and
the
management
decided
to
get
to
louis
and
send
the
show
to
winter
quarters
and
organize
for
next
season
so
we
have
had
a
time
closing
up
for
the
season
and
sending
the
animals
to
the
barns
on
our
farm
up
north
and
discharging
and
paying
off
the
performers
and
bidding
everybody
we
have
bought
presents
for
everybody
and
it
has
been
a
picnic
pa
had
a
big
heart
with
roses
all
around
it
made
of
a
horse
collar
covered
with
flowers
which
came
from
the
freaks
and
the
performers
remembered
him
with
presents
and
pa
gave
everybody
something
and
everybody
got
together
in
the
main
tent
and
made
speeches
the
manager
thanked
everybody
and
promised
that
next
year
we
would
have
the
greatest
show
on
earth
he
said
the
management
had
decided
that
what
we
lacked
this
year
was
a
wild
west
show
as
the
people
everywhere
seemed
to
dote
on
busting
broncos
and
roping
cattle
and
chasing
buffaloes
and
seeing
indians
and
rough
riders
chase
up
and
down
the
arena
he
felt
that
in
justice
to
our
president
it
was
proper
to
have
a
wild
west
show
that
would
make
things
hum
next
year
he
said
he
took
pleasure
in
informing
the
people
of
the
show
that
pa
had
been
commissioned
to
go
out
west
at
once
and
secure
the
indians
and
cowboys
horses
that
buck
and
bounce
off
the
riders
cattle
that
would
stand
it
to
be
lassoed
and
thrown
down
for
the
amusement
of
the
public
buffaloes
that
would
bellow
and
act
like
old
times
on
the
plains
stage
coaches
and
robbers
and
he
promised
that
next
year
they
would
have
no
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
the
show
he
said
pa
was
authorized
to
spare
no
expense
to
round
up
a
wild
west
show
second
to
none
the
performers
and
hands
cheered
the
manager
and
then
they
yelled
for
pa
for
a
speech
pa
got
up
on
the
tub
that
the
elephants
stand
on
and
said
that
it
was
true
what
the
manager
said
about
a
wild
west
show
and
that
he
was
proud
of
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
he
should
be
glad
to
take
an
expedition
and
go
out
into
the
far
west
and
beard
the
wild
west
indian
in
his
tepee
and
engage
indians
by
the
hundred
to
come
with
us
next
year
he
would
pierce
the
wilderness
of
the
west
in
search
of
the
wildest
red
men
and
would
hunt
the
cowboy
in
his
lair
and
secure
those
who
could
make
the
most
trouble
for
cattle
and
horses
and
shoot
up
an
audience
if
necessary
to
keep
the
peace
and
he
would
buy
buffaloes
enough
so
every
performer
could
ride
one
if
he
wanted
to
he
said
while
we
had
this
year
had
some
attempts
at
a
wild
west
department
in
our
show
it
was
only
a
tame
imitation
of
what
we
would
have
next
year
and
he
wanted
them
all
to
pray
for
him
that
he
might
come
out
of
the
wild
far
west
without
being
killed
he
said
he
should
take
hennery
along
with
him
as
a
mascot
and
if
the
worst
came
he
could
trade
me
to
an
indian
tribe
for
ponies
or
leave
me
as
a
hostage
with
some
tribe
until
he
returned
the
indians
at
the
close
of
next
season
pa
closed
his
remarks
by
hoping
that
nothing
had
occurred
during
the
past
season
that
would
cause
anybody
to
have
it
in
for
him
he
had
tried
to
be
impartial
in
his
cussedness
and
while
he
felt
that
he
had
been
considered
an
interloper
in
the
profession
at
first
he
had
found
that
everybody
looked
upon
him
later
in
the
season
as
the
main
guy
in
the
show
and
that
all
had
felt
at
liberty
to
give
it
to
him
in
the
neck
on
every
proper
occasion
and
he
felt
that
he
had
taken
his
medicine
like
a
thoroughbred
illustration
i
will
search
for
the
wildest
of
red
men
they
gave
three
cheers
for
pa
and
then
they
brought
in
the
blankets
and
tossed
everybody
up
until
they
lost
everything
out
of
their
pockets
and
yelled
that
they
had
enough
and
they
wound
up
by
tossing
pa
up
in
the
blanket
until
he
could
see
stars
they
were
going
to
give
the
fat
woman
a
hoist
when
the
boss
canvasman
gave
the
signal
to
take
down
the
tents
and
all
was
in
a
hubbub
for
about
minutes
illustration
they
tossed
pa
up
in
the
blanket
when
everything
was
down
and
everybody
went
to
the
train
after
joining
hands
around
the
middle
ring
and
singing
old
lang
sine
pa
and
i
and
the
managers
went
to
a
hotel
to
organize
our
expedition
to
the
far
west
in
search
of
talent
for
a
wild
west
show
that
shall
be
the
greatest
ever
put
under
canvas
after
all
had
gone
away
and
only
pa
and
i
and
the
managers
were
left
it
seemed
as
we
thought
over
the
incidents
of
the
past
season
as
though
there
had
been
an
earthquake
and
the
whole
show
had
been
blotted
out
of
existence
pa
choked
up
and
was
going
to
cry
and
i
got
my
throat
full
of
something
so
i
could
not
speak
and
the
managers
began
to
wipe
their
eyes
and
pa
saved
the
day
by
saying
oh
what
the
use
let
order
up
some
highballs
and
when
they
came
with
a
red
lemonade
for
me
pa
said
well
here
to
the
people
that
crowd
around
the
ticket
wagon
and
fight
to
get
the
first
ticket
when
the
window
is
open
and
go
away
after
the
show
and
say
it
is
the
greatest
show
ever
hey
rube
said
the
manager
and
we
drank
standing
and
pa
went
out
and
bought
tickets
for
cheyenne
and
some
beads
to
give
to
the
indians
we
shall
visit
in
the
west
