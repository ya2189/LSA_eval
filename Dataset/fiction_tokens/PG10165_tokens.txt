shipwreck
once
only
in
the
occasional
travelling
of
thirty
years
did
i
lose
any
important
article
of
luggage
and
that
loss
occurred
not
under
the
haphazard
confusion
of
english
or
the
elaborate
misrule
of
continental
journeys
but
through
the
absolute
perfection
and
democratic
despotism
of
the
american
system
i
had
to
give
up
a
visit
to
the
scenery
of
cooper
best
indian
novels
no
slight
sacrifice
and
hasten
at
once
to
new
york
to
repair
the
loss
this
incident
brought
me
on
an
evening
near
the
middle
of
september
on
board
a
river
steamboat
starting
from
albany
the
capital
of
the
state
for
the
empire
city
the
banks
of
the
lower
hudson
are
as
well
worth
seeing
as
those
of
the
rhine
itself
but
even
america
has
not
yet
devised
means
of
lighting
them
up
at
night
and
consequently
i
had
no
amusement
but
such
as
i
could
find
in
the
conversation
of
my
with
one
of
these
whose
abstinence
from
personal
questions
led
me
to
take
him
for
an
englishman
i
spoke
of
my
visit
to
niagara
the
one
wonder
of
the
world
that
answers
its
warranty
and
to
montreal
as
i
spoke
of
the
strong
and
general
canadian
feeling
of
loyalty
to
the
english
crown
and
connection
a
yankee
bystander
observed
wal
stranger
i
reckon
we
could
take
if
we
wanted
tu
yes
i
replied
if
you
think
them
worth
the
price
but
if
you
do
you
rate
them
even
more
highly
than
they
rate
themselves
and
english
colonists
are
not
much
behind
the
citizens
of
the
model
republic
in
honest
wal
he
said
how
much
du
yew
we
shall
hev
to
pay
not
more
perhaps
than
you
can
afford
only
california
and
every
atlantic
seaport
from
portland
to
galveston
reckon
yew
may
be
about
right
stranger
he
said
falling
back
with
tolerable
and
to
do
them
justice
the
bystanders
seemed
to
think
the
retort
no
worse
than
the
provocation
deserved
i
am
sorry
said
my
friend
you
should
have
fallen
in
with
so
unpleasant
a
specimen
of
the
character
your
countrymen
ascribe
with
too
much
reason
to
americans
i
have
been
long
in
england
and
never
met
with
such
discourtesy
from
any
one
who
recognised
me
as
an
american
after
this
our
conversation
became
less
reserved
and
i
found
that
i
was
conversing
with
one
of
the
most
renowned
officers
of
irregular
cavalry
in
the
late
confederate
service
a
service
which
in
the
efficiency
brilliancy
and
daring
of
that
especial
arm
has
never
been
surpassed
since
maharbal
african
light
horse
were
recognised
by
friends
and
foes
as
the
finest
corps
in
the
small
splendid
army
of
hannibal
colonel
a
the
reader
will
learn
why
i
give
neither
his
name
nor
real
rank
spoke
with
some
bitterness
of
the
inquisitiveness
which
rendered
it
impossible
he
said
to
trust
an
american
with
a
secret
and
very
difficult
to
keep
one
without
lying
we
were
presently
joined
by
major
b
who
had
been
employed
during
the
war
in
the
conduct
of
many
critical
communications
and
had
shown
great
ingenuity
in
devising
and
unravelling
ciphers
on
this
subject
a
somewhat
protracted
discussion
arose
i
inclined
to
the
doctrine
of
poe
that
no
cipher
can
be
devised
which
can
not
be
detected
by
an
experienced
hand
my
friends
indicated
simple
methods
of
defeating
the
processes
on
which
decipherers
rely
poe
theory
said
the
major
depends
upon
the
frequent
recurrence
of
certain
letters
syllables
and
brief
words
in
any
given
language
for
instance
of
and
and
and
in
english
now
it
is
perfectly
easy
to
introduce
abbreviations
for
each
of
the
common
short
words
and
terminations
and
equally
easy
to
baffle
the
decipherer
reliance
thereon
by
inserting
meaningless
symbols
to
separate
the
words
by
employing
two
signs
for
a
common
letter
or
so
arranging
your
cipher
that
no
one
shall
without
extreme
difficulty
know
which
marks
stand
for
single
and
which
for
several
combined
letters
where
one
letter
ends
and
another
begins
after
some
debate
colonel
a
wrote
down
and
handed
me
two
lines
in
a
cipher
whose
character
at
once
struck
me
as
very
remarkable
i
grant
said
i
that
these
hieroglyphics
might
well
puzzle
a
more
practised
decipherer
than
myself
still
i
can
point
out
even
here
a
clue
which
might
help
detection
there
occur
even
in
these
two
lines
three
or
four
symbols
which
from
their
size
and
complication
are
evidently
abbreviations
again
the
distinct
forms
are
very
few
and
have
obviously
been
made
to
serve
for
different
letters
by
some
slight
alterations
devised
upon
a
fixed
rule
in
a
word
the
cipher
has
been
constructed
upon
a
general
principle
and
though
it
may
take
a
long
time
to
find
out
what
that
principle
is
it
affords
a
clue
which
carefully
followed
out
will
probably
lead
to
detection
you
have
perceived
said
colonel
a
a
fact
which
it
took
me
very
long
to
discover
i
have
not
deciphered
all
the
more
difficult
passages
of
the
manuscript
from
which
i
took
this
example
but
i
have
ascertained
the
meaning
of
all
its
simple
characters
and
your
inference
is
certainly
correct
here
he
stopped
abruptly
as
if
he
thought
he
had
said
too
much
and
the
subject
dropped
we
reached
new
york
early
in
the
morning
and
separated
having
arranged
to
visit
that
afternoon
a
celebrated
spiritual
medium
who
was
then
giving
in
the
empire
city
and
of
whom
my
friend
had
heard
and
repeated
to
me
several
more
or
less
marvellous
stories
our
visit
however
was
unsatisfactory
and
as
we
came
away
colonel
a
said
well
i
suppose
this
experience
confirms
you
in
your
disbelief
no
said
i
my
first
visits
have
generally
been
failures
and
i
have
more
than
once
been
told
that
my
own
temperament
is
most
unfavourable
to
the
success
of
a
seance
nevertheless
i
have
in
some
cases
witnessed
marvels
perfectly
inexplicable
by
known
natural
laws
and
i
have
heard
and
read
of
others
attested
by
evidence
i
certainly
can
not
consider
inferior
to
my
own
why
he
said
i
thought
from
your
conversation
last
night
you
were
a
complete
disbeliever
i
believe
answered
i
in
very
little
of
what
i
have
seen
but
that
little
is
quite
sufficient
to
dispose
of
the
theory
of
pure
imposture
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
spiritual
and
nothing
very
human
in
the
pranks
played
by
or
in
the
presence
of
the
mediums
they
remind
one
more
of
the
feats
of
traditionary
goblins
mischievous
noisy
untrustworthy
insensible
to
ridicule
apparently
delighting
to
make
fools
of
men
and
perfectly
indifferent
to
having
the
tables
turned
upon
themselves
but
do
you
believe
in
goblins
no
i
replied
no
more
than
in
ghosts
and
less
than
in
apparitions
i
am
not
bound
to
find
either
sceptics
or
spiritualists
in
plausible
explanations
but
when
they
insist
on
an
alternative
to
their
respective
theories
i
suggest
puck
as
at
least
equally
credible
with
satan
shakespeare
or
the
of
imposture
it
is
the
very
extravagance
of
illogical
temper
to
call
on
me
to
furnish
an
explanation
i
say
know
far
too
little
of
the
thing
itself
to
guess
at
its
causes
but
of
the
current
guesses
imposture
seems
inconsistent
with
the
evidence
and
agency
with
the
character
of
the
phenomena
that
replied
colonel
a
sounds
common
sense
and
sounds
even
more
commonplace
and
yet
no
one
seems
really
to
draw
a
strong
clear
line
between
and
disbelief
and
you
are
the
first
and
only
man
i
ever
met
who
hesitates
to
affirm
the
impossibility
of
that
which
seems
to
him
wildly
improbable
contrary
at
once
to
received
opinion
and
to
his
own
experience
and
contrary
moreover
to
all
known
natural
laws
and
all
inferences
hitherto
drawn
from
them
your
men
of
science
dogmatise
like
divines
not
only
on
things
they
have
not
seen
but
on
things
they
refuse
to
see
and
your
divines
are
half
of
them
afraid
of
satan
and
the
other
half
of
science
the
men
of
science
have
i
replied
like
every
other
class
their
especial
bias
their
peculiar
professional
temptation
the
bigotry
of
positivists
is
quite
as
bitter
and
irrational
as
the
theological
bigotry
of
religious
fanatics
at
present
the
two
powers
countervail
and
balance
each
other
but
as
three
hundred
years
ago
i
should
certainly
have
been
burnt
for
a
heretic
so
fifty
or
a
hundred
years
hence
could
i
live
so
long
i
should
be
in
equal
apprehension
of
being
burnt
by
some
successor
of
congreve
harrison
or
professor
huxley
for
presuming
to
believe
in
providential
government
the
intolerance
of
incredulity
returned
colonel
a
is
a
sore
subject
with
me
i
once
witnessed
a
phenomenon
which
was
to
me
quite
as
extraordinary
as
any
of
the
performances
i
have
at
this
moment
in
my
possession
apparently
irresistible
evidence
of
the
reality
of
what
then
took
place
and
i
am
sure
that
there
exists
at
a
point
on
the
earth
surface
which
unluckily
i
can
not
define
strong
corroborative
proof
of
my
story
nevertheless
the
first
persons
who
heard
it
utterly
ridiculed
it
and
were
disposed
to
treat
me
either
as
a
madman
or
at
best
as
an
audacious
trespasser
on
that
privilege
of
lying
which
belonged
to
them
as
mariners
i
told
it
afterwards
to
three
gentlemen
of
station
character
and
intelligence
every
one
of
whom
had
known
me
as
soldier
and
i
hope
as
gentleman
for
years
and
in
each
case
the
result
was
a
duel
which
has
silenced
those
who
imputed
to
me
an
unworthy
and
purposeless
falsehood
but
has
left
a
heavy
burden
on
my
conscience
and
has
prevented
me
ever
since
from
repeating
what
i
know
to
be
true
and
believe
to
be
of
greater
interest
and
in
some
sense
of
greater
importance
than
any
scientific
discovery
of
the
last
century
since
the
last
occasion
on
which
i
told
it
seven
years
have
elapsed
and
i
never
have
met
any
one
but
yourself
to
whom
i
have
thought
it
possible
to
disclose
it
i
have
i
answered
an
intense
interest
in
all
occult
phenomena
believing
in
regard
to
alleged
magic
as
the
scientists
say
of
practical
science
that
every
one
branch
of
such
knowledge
throws
light
on
others
and
if
there
be
nothing
in
your
story
which
it
is
personally
painful
to
relate
you
need
not
be
silenced
by
any
apprehension
of
discourteous
criticism
on
my
part
i
assure
you
he
said
i
have
no
such
wish
now
to
tell
the
story
as
i
had
at
first
it
is
now
associated
with
the
most
painful
incident
of
my
life
and
i
have
lost
altogether
that
natural
desire
for
sympathy
and
human
interest
in
a
matter
deeply
interesting
to
myself
which
like
every
one
else
i
felt
at
first
and
which
is
i
suppose
the
motive
that
prompts
us
all
to
relate
often
and
early
any
occurrence
that
has
keenly
affected
us
in
whatever
manner
but
i
think
that
i
have
no
right
to
suppress
so
remarkable
a
fact
if
by
telling
it
i
can
place
it
effectually
on
record
for
the
benefit
of
men
sensible
enough
to
believe
that
it
may
have
occurred
especially
since
somewhere
in
the
world
there
must
yet
exist
proof
that
it
did
occur
if
you
will
come
to
my
rooms
in
street
tomorrow
number
i
will
not
promise
but
i
think
that
i
shall
have
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
what
i
have
to
tell
and
to
place
in
your
hands
that
portion
of
the
evidence
which
is
still
at
my
command
evidence
that
has
a
significance
of
its
own
to
which
my
experience
is
merely
episodical
i
spent
that
evening
with
the
family
of
a
friend
one
of
several
former
officers
of
the
confederacy
whose
friendship
is
the
one
permanent
and
valuable
result
of
my
american
tour
i
mentioned
the
colonel
name
and
my
friend
the
head
of
the
family
having
served
with
him
through
the
virginian
campaigns
expressed
the
highest
confidence
in
his
character
the
highest
opinion
of
his
honour
and
veracity
but
spoke
with
bitter
regret
and
pain
of
the
duels
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
especially
of
one
which
had
been
fatal
remarking
that
the
motive
in
each
instance
remained
unknown
even
to
the
seconds
i
am
sure
he
said
that
they
were
not
could
not
have
been
fought
for
the
one
cause
that
would
justify
them
and
explain
the
secrecy
of
the
quarrel
some
question
involving
female
honour
or
reputation
i
can
hardly
conceive
that
any
one
of
his
adversaries
could
have
called
in
question
in
any
way
the
personal
loyalty
of
colonel
a
and
as
you
remarked
of
general
m
it
is
too
absurd
for
a
man
who
had
faced
over
and
over
again
the
fire
of
a
whole
brigade
who
had
led
charges
against
fourfold
numbers
to
prove
his
personal
courage
with
sword
or
pistol
or
to
think
that
any
one
would
have
doubted
either
his
spirit
or
his
nerve
had
he
refused
to
fight
whatever
the
provocation
moreover
in
each
case
he
was
the
challenger
then
these
duels
have
injured
him
in
southern
opinion
and
have
probably
tended
to
isolate
him
from
society
no
he
replied
deeply
as
they
were
regretted
and
disapproved
his
services
during
the
war
were
so
brilliant
and
his
personal
character
stands
so
high
that
nothing
could
have
induced
his
to
put
any
social
stigma
upon
him
to
me
he
must
know
that
he
would
be
most
welcome
yet
though
we
have
lived
in
the
same
city
for
five
years
i
have
only
encountered
him
three
or
four
times
in
the
street
and
then
he
has
passed
with
the
fewest
possible
words
and
has
neither
given
me
his
address
nor
accepted
my
urgent
invitations
to
visit
us
here
i
think
that
there
is
something
in
the
story
of
those
duels
that
will
never
be
known
certainly
something
that
has
never
been
guessed
yet
and
i
think
that
either
the
circumstances
in
which
they
must
have
had
their
origin
or
the
duels
themselves
have
so
weighed
upon
his
spirits
perhaps
upon
his
conscience
that
he
has
chosen
to
avoid
his
former
friends
most
of
them
also
the
friends
of
his
antagonists
though
the
war
ruined
him
as
utterly
as
any
of
the
thousands
of
southern
gentlemen
whom
it
has
reduced
from
wealth
to
absolute
poverty
he
has
refused
every
employment
which
would
bring
him
before
the
public
eye
is
there
i
asked
any
point
of
honour
on
which
you
could
suppose
him
to
be
so
exceptionally
sensitive
that
he
would
think
it
necessary
to
take
the
life
of
a
man
who
touched
him
on
that
point
though
afterwards
his
regret
if
not
repentance
might
be
keen
enough
to
crush
his
spirit
or
break
his
heart
the
general
paused
for
a
moment
and
his
son
then
interposed
i
have
heard
it
said
that
colonel
a
was
in
general
the
least
quarrelsome
of
confederate
officers
but
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
where
his
statement
upon
some
point
of
fact
had
been
challenged
by
a
comrade
who
did
not
intend
to
question
his
veracity
but
simply
the
accuracy
of
his
observation
their
brother
officers
had
much
trouble
in
preventing
a
serious
difficulty
the
next
day
i
called
as
agreed
upon
my
friend
and
with
some
reluctance
he
commenced
his
story
during
the
last
campaign
in
february
i
was
sent
by
general
lee
with
despatches
for
kirby
smith
then
commanding
beyond
the
mississippi
i
was
unable
to
return
before
the
surrender
and
for
reasons
into
which
i
need
not
enter
i
believed
myself
to
be
marked
out
by
the
federal
government
for
vengeance
if
i
had
remained
within
their
reach
i
might
have
shared
the
fate
of
wirz
and
other
victims
of
calumnies
which
once
put
in
circulation
during
the
war
their
official
authors
dared
not
retract
at
its
close
now
i
and
others
who
if
captured
in
might
probably
have
been
hanged
are
neither
molested
nor
even
suspected
of
any
other
offence
than
that
of
fighting
as
our
opponents
fought
for
the
state
to
which
our
allegiance
was
due
however
i
thought
it
necessary
to
escape
before
the
final
surrender
of
our
forces
beyond
the
mississippi
i
made
my
way
to
mexico
and
like
one
or
two
southern
officers
of
greater
distinction
than
myself
entered
the
service
of
the
emperor
maximilian
not
as
mere
soldiers
of
fortune
but
because
knowing
better
than
any
but
her
southern
neighbours
knew
it
the
miserable
anarchy
of
mexico
under
the
republic
we
regarded
conquest
as
the
one
chance
of
regeneration
for
that
country
and
the
emperor
maximilian
as
a
hero
who
had
devoted
himself
to
a
task
heroic
at
once
in
its
danger
and
difficulty
the
restoration
of
a
people
with
whom
his
house
had
a
certain
historical
connection
to
a
place
among
the
nations
of
the
civilised
world
after
his
fall
i
should
certainly
have
been
shot
had
i
been
caught
by
the
juarists
in
pursuit
of
me
i
gained
the
pacific
coast
and
got
on
board
an
english
vessel
whose
captain
loading
for
san
francisco
generously
weighed
anchor
and
sailed
with
but
half
a
cargo
to
give
me
a
chance
of
safety
he
transferred
me
a
few
days
afterwards
to
a
dutch
vessel
bound
for
brisbane
for
at
that
time
i
thought
of
settling
in
queensland
the
crew
was
and
consisted
chiefly
of
lascars
malays
and
two
or
three
european
desperadoes
of
all
languages
and
of
no
country
her
master
was
barely
competent
to
the
ordinary
duties
of
his
command
and
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
when
the
first
storm
that
we
encountered
drove
us
completely
out
of
our
course
nor
was
i
much
astonished
that
the
captain
was
for
some
days
partly
from
fright
and
partly
from
drink
incapable
of
using
his
sextant
to
ascertain
the
position
of
the
ship
one
night
we
were
awakened
by
a
tremendous
shock
and
to
spare
you
the
details
of
a
shipwreck
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
story
we
found
ourselves
when
day
broke
fast
on
a
coral
reef
about
a
mile
from
an
island
of
no
great
size
and
out
of
sight
of
all
other
land
the
sextant
having
been
broken
to
pieces
i
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
the
position
of
this
island
nor
do
i
now
know
anything
of
it
except
that
it
lay
in
the
month
of
august
within
the
region
of
the
southeast
trade
winds
we
pulled
on
shore
but
after
exploring
the
island
it
was
found
to
yield
nothing
attractive
to
seamen
except
with
which
our
crew
had
soon
supplied
themselves
as
largely
as
they
wished
and
fish
which
were
abundant
and
easily
caught
and
of
which
they
were
soon
tired
the
captain
therefore
when
he
had
recovered
his
sobriety
and
his
courage
had
no
great
difficulty
in
inducing
them
to
return
to
the
ship
and
endeavour
either
to
get
her
off
or
construct
from
her
timbers
a
raft
which
following
the
course
of
the
winds
might
it
was
thought
bring
them
into
the
track
of
vessels
this
would
take
some
time
and
i
meanwhile
was
allowed
to
remain
my
own
wish
on
the
noise
dirt
and
foul
smells
of
the
vessel
being
especially
in
that
climate
intolerable
about
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
august
i
was
lying
towards
the
southern
end
of
the
island
on
a
little
hillock
tolerably
clear
of
trees
and
facing
a
sort
of
glade
or
avenue
covered
only
with
brush
and
young
trees
which
allowed
me
to
see
the
sky
within
perhaps
twenty
degrees
of
the
horizon
suddenly
looking
up
i
saw
what
appeared
at
first
like
a
brilliant
star
considerably
higher
than
the
sun
it
increased
in
size
with
amazing
rapidity
till
in
a
very
few
seconds
after
its
first
appearance
it
had
a
very
perceptible
disc
for
an
instant
it
obscured
the
sun
in
another
moment
a
tremendous
shock
temporarily
deprived
me
of
my
senses
and
i
think
that
more
than
an
hour
had
elapsed
before
i
recovered
them
sitting
up
somewhat
confused
and
looking
around
me
i
became
aware
that
some
strange
accident
had
occurred
in
every
direction
i
saw
such
traces
of
havoc
as
i
had
witnessed
more
than
once
when
a
confederate
force
holding
an
impenetrable
woodland
had
been
shelled
at
random
for
some
hours
with
the
largest
guns
that
the
enemy
could
bring
into
the
field
trees
were
torn
and
broken
branches
scattered
in
all
directions
fragments
of
stone
earth
and
coral
rock
flung
all
around
particularly
i
remember
that
a
piece
of
metal
of
considerable
size
had
cut
off
the
tops
of
two
or
three
trees
and
fixed
itself
at
last
on
what
was
now
the
summit
of
one
about
a
third
of
whose
length
had
been
broken
off
and
lay
on
the
ground
i
soon
perceived
that
this
miraculous
bombardment
had
proceeded
from
a
point
to
the
the
direction
in
which
at
that
season
and
hour
the
sun
was
visible
proceeding
thitherward
the
evidences
of
destruction
became
every
minute
more
marked
i
might
say
more
universal
trees
had
been
thrown
down
torn
up
by
the
roots
hurled
against
one
another
rocks
broken
and
flung
to
great
distances
some
even
thrown
up
in
the
air
and
so
reversed
in
falling
that
while
again
half
buried
in
the
soil
they
exposed
what
had
been
their
undermost
surface
in
a
word
before
i
had
gone
two
miles
i
saw
that
the
island
had
sustained
a
shock
which
might
have
been
that
of
an
earthquake
which
certainly
equalled
that
of
the
most
violent
central
american
earthquakes
in
severity
but
which
had
none
of
the
special
peculiarities
of
that
kind
of
natural
convulsion
presently
i
came
upon
fragments
of
a
shining
pale
yellow
metal
generally
small
but
in
one
or
two
cases
of
remarkable
size
and
shape
apparently
torn
from
some
sheet
of
great
thickness
in
one
case
i
found
embedded
between
two
such
jagged
fragments
a
piece
of
remarkably
hard
impenetrable
cement
at
last
i
came
to
a
point
from
which
through
the
destruction
of
the
trees
the
sea
was
visible
in
the
direction
in
which
the
ship
had
lain
but
the
ship
as
in
a
few
moments
i
satisfied
myself
had
utterly
disappeared
reaching
the
beach
i
found
that
the
shock
had
driven
the
sea
far
up
upon
the
land
fishes
lying
fifty
yards
inland
and
everything
drenched
in
salt
water
at
last
guided
by
the
signs
of
devastation
i
reached
the
point
whence
the
mischief
had
proceeded
i
can
give
no
idea
in
words
of
what
i
there
found
the
earth
had
been
torn
open
rooted
up
as
if
by
a
gigantic
explosion
in
some
places
fragments
of
the
coral
rock
which
at
a
depth
of
several
feet
formed
the
bed
of
the
island
were
discernible
far
below
the
actual
surface
at
others
the
surface
itself
was
raised
several
feet
by
of
every
kind
what
i
may
call
the
crater
though
it
was
no
actual
hole
but
rather
a
cavity
torn
and
then
filled
up
by
falling
fragments
was
two
or
three
hundred
feet
in
circumference
and
in
this
space
i
found
considerable
masses
of
the
same
metallic
substance
attached
generally
to
pieces
of
the
cement
after
examining
and
puzzling
myself
over
this
strange
scene
for
some
time
my
next
care
was
to
seek
traces
of
the
ship
and
of
her
crew
and
before
long
i
saw
just
outside
the
coral
reef
what
had
been
her
bowsprit
and
presently
floating
on
the
sea
one
of
her
masts
with
the
sail
attached
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
shock
had
extended
to
her
had
driven
her
off
the
reef
where
she
had
been
fixed
into
the
deep
water
outside
where
she
must
have
sunk
immediately
and
had
broken
her
spars
no
traces
of
her
crew
were
to
be
seen
they
had
probably
been
stunned
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
thrown
into
deep
water
and
before
i
came
in
sight
of
the
point
where
she
had
perished
whatever
animal
bodies
were
to
be
found
must
have
been
devoured
by
the
sharks
which
abounded
in
that
neighbourhood
dismay
perplexity
and
horror
prevented
my
doing
anything
to
solve
my
doubts
or
relieve
my
astonishment
before
the
sun
went
down
and
during
the
night
my
sleep
was
broken
by
snatches
of
horrible
dreams
and
intervals
of
waking
during
which
i
marvelled
over
what
i
had
seen
scarcely
crediting
my
memory
or
my
senses
in
the
morning
i
went
back
to
the
crater
and
with
some
tools
that
had
been
left
on
shore
contrived
to
dig
somewhat
deeply
among
the
with
which
it
was
filled
i
found
very
little
that
could
enlighten
me
except
pieces
of
glass
of
various
metals
of
wood
some
of
which
seemed
apparently
to
have
been
portions
of
furniture
and
one
damaged
but
still
entire
relic
which
i
preserved
and
brought
away
with
me
here
the
colonel
removed
a
newspaper
which
had
covered
a
portion
of
his
table
and
showed
me
a
metallic
case
beaten
out
of
all
shape
but
apparently
of
what
had
been
a
silvery
colour
very
little
rusted
though
much
soiled
this
he
opened
and
i
saw
at
once
that
it
was
of
enormous
thickness
and
solidity
to
which
and
to
favouring
circumstances
it
owed
its
preservation
in
the
general
ruin
he
described
that
it
had
undergone
some
severe
and
violent
shock
there
could
be
no
question
beside
the
box
lay
a
less
damaged
though
still
seriously
injured
object
in
which
i
recognised
the
resemblance
of
a
book
of
considerable
thickness
and
bound
in
metal
like
that
of
the
case
this
i
afterwards
ascertained
beyond
doubt
to
be
a
metalloid
alloy
whereof
the
principal
ingredient
was
aluminium
or
some
substance
so
closely
resembling
it
as
not
to
be
distinguishable
from
it
by
simple
chemical
tests
a
friend
to
whom
i
submitted
a
small
portion
broken
off
from
the
rest
expressed
no
doubt
that
it
was
a
kind
of
aluminium
bronze
but
inclined
to
believe
that
it
contained
no
inconsiderable
proportion
of
a
metal
with
which
chemists
are
as
yet
imperfectly
acquainted
perhaps
he
said
silicon
certainly
something
which
had
given
to
the
alloy
a
hardness
and
tenacity
unknown
to
any
familiar
metallurgical
compound
this
said
my
friend
opening
the
volume
is
a
manuscript
which
was
contained
in
this
case
when
i
took
it
from
among
the
debris
of
the
crater
i
should
have
told
you
that
i
found
there
what
i
believed
to
be
fragments
of
human
flesh
and
bone
but
so
crushed
and
mangled
that
i
could
form
no
positive
conclusion
my
next
care
was
to
escape
from
the
island
which
i
felt
sure
lay
far
from
the
ordinary
course
of
merchant
vessels
a
boat
which
had
brought
me
ashore
the
smaller
of
the
two
belonging
to
the
ship
had
fortunately
been
left
on
the
end
of
the
island
furthest
from
that
on
which
the
vessel
had
been
driven
and
had
owing
to
its
remoteness
though
damaged
not
been
fatally
injured
by
the
shock
i
repaired
this
made
and
fixed
a
mast
and
with
no
little
difficulty
contrived
to
manufacture
a
sort
of
sail
from
strips
of
bark
woven
together
knowing
that
even
if
i
could
sustain
life
on
the
island
life
under
such
circumstances
would
not
be
worth
having
i
was
perfectly
willing
to
embark
upon
a
voyage
in
which
i
was
well
aware
the
chances
of
death
were
at
least
as
five
to
one
i
caught
and
contrived
to
smoke
a
quantity
of
fish
sufficient
to
last
me
for
a
fortnight
and
filled
a
small
cask
with
brackish
but
still
drinkable
water
in
this
vessel
thus
stored
i
embarked
about
a
fortnight
after
the
day
of
the
mysterious
shock
on
the
second
evening
of
my
voyage
i
was
caught
by
a
gale
which
compelled
me
to
lower
the
sail
and
before
which
i
was
driven
for
three
days
and
nights
in
what
direction
i
can
hardly
guess
on
the
fourth
morning
the
wind
had
fallen
and
by
noon
it
was
a
perfect
calm
i
need
not
describe
what
has
been
described
by
so
many
shipwrecked
sailors
the
sufferings
of
a
solitary
voyager
in
an
open
boat
under
a
tropical
sun
the
storm
had
supplied
me
with
water
more
than
enough
so
that
i
was
spared
that
of
thirst
which
seems
in
the
memory
of
such
sufferers
to
absorb
all
others
towards
evening
a
slight
breeze
sprang
up
and
by
morning
i
came
in
sight
of
a
vessel
which
i
contrived
to
board
her
crew
however
and
even
her
captain
utterly
discredited
such
part
of
my
strange
story
as
i
told
them
on
that
point
however
i
will
say
no
more
than
this
i
will
place
this
manuscript
in
your
hands
i
will
give
you
the
key
to
such
of
its
ciphers
as
i
have
been
able
to
make
out
the
language
i
believe
for
i
am
no
scholar
is
latin
of
a
mediæval
type
but
there
are
words
which
if
i
rightly
decipher
them
are
not
latin
and
hardly
seem
to
belong
to
any
known
language
most
of
them
i
fancy
terms
invented
to
describe
various
technical
devices
unknown
to
the
world
when
the
manuscript
was
written
i
only
make
it
a
condition
that
you
shall
not
publish
the
story
during
my
life
that
if
you
show
the
manuscript
or
mention
the
tale
in
confidence
to
any
one
you
will
strictly
keep
my
secret
and
that
if
after
my
death
of
which
you
shall
be
advised
you
do
publish
it
you
will
afford
no
clue
by
which
the
donor
could
be
confidently
identified
i
promise
said
i
but
i
should
like
to
ask
you
one
question
what
do
you
conceive
to
have
been
the
cause
of
the
extraordinary
shock
you
felt
and
of
the
havoc
you
witnessed
what
in
short
the
nature
of
the
occurrence
and
the
origin
of
the
manuscript
you
entrust
to
my
care
why
need
you
ask
me
he
returned
you
are
as
capable
as
myself
of
drawing
a
deduction
from
what
i
have
told
you
and
i
have
told
you
everything
i
believe
that
could
assist
you
the
manuscript
will
tell
the
rest
but
said
i
an
actual
often
receives
from
a
number
of
little
facts
which
he
can
not
remember
which
are
perhaps
too
minute
to
have
been
actually
and
individually
noted
by
him
an
impression
which
is
more
likely
to
be
correct
than
any
that
could
be
formed
by
a
stranger
on
the
fullest
on
the
closest
examination
of
what
remains
in
the
witness
memory
i
should
like
to
hear
before
opening
the
manuscript
what
you
believe
to
have
been
its
origin
i
can
only
say
he
answered
that
what
must
be
inferred
from
the
manuscript
is
what
i
had
inferred
before
i
opened
it
that
same
explanation
was
the
only
one
that
ever
occurred
to
me
even
in
the
first
night
it
then
seemed
to
me
utterly
incredible
but
it
is
still
the
only
conceivable
explanation
that
my
mind
can
suggest
did
you
asked
i
connect
the
shock
and
the
relics
which
i
presume
you
know
were
not
on
the
island
before
the
shock
with
the
meteor
and
the
strange
obscuration
of
the
sun
i
certainly
did
he
said
having
done
so
there
could
be
but
one
conclusion
as
to
the
quarter
from
which
the
shock
was
received
the
examination
and
transcription
of
the
manuscript
with
all
the
help
afforded
me
by
my
friend
previous
efforts
was
the
work
of
several
years
there
is
as
the
reader
will
see
more
than
one
valde
as
the
scholiasts
have
it
and
there
are
passages
in
which
whether
from
the
illegibility
of
the
manuscript
or
the
employment
of
technical
terms
unknown
to
me
i
can
not
be
certain
of
the
correctness
of
my
translation
such
however
as
it
is
i
give
it
to
the
world
having
fulfilled
i
believe
every
one
of
the
conditions
imposed
upon
me
by
my
late
and
deeply
regretted
friend
the
character
of
the
manuscript
is
very
curious
and
its
translation
was
exceedingly
difficult
the
material
on
which
it
is
written
resembles
nothing
used
for
such
purposes
on
earth
it
is
more
like
a
very
fine
linen
or
silken
web
but
it
is
far
closer
in
texture
and
has
never
been
woven
in
any
kind
of
loom
at
all
like
those
employed
in
any
manufacture
known
to
history
or
archaeology
the
letters
or
more
properly
symbols
are
minute
but
executed
with
extraordinary
clearness
i
should
fancy
that
something
more
like
a
pencil
than
a
pen
but
with
a
finer
point
than
that
of
the
finest
pencil
was
employed
in
the
writing
contractions
and
combinations
are
not
merely
frequent
but
almost
universal
there
is
scarcely
an
instance
in
which
five
consecutive
letters
are
separately
written
and
there
is
no
single
line
in
which
half
a
dozen
contractions
often
including
from
four
to
ten
letters
do
not
occur
the
pages
are
of
the
size
of
an
ordinary
duodecimo
but
contain
some
fifty
lines
per
page
and
perhaps
one
hundred
and
fifty
letters
in
each
line
what
were
probably
the
first
half
dozen
pages
have
been
utterly
destroyed
and
the
next
half
dozen
are
so
mashed
tattered
and
defaced
that
only
a
few
sentences
here
and
there
are
legible
i
have
contrived
however
to
combine
these
into
what
i
believe
to
be
a
substantially
correct
representation
of
the
author
meaning
the
latin
is
of
a
monastic
sometimes
almost
canine
quality
with
many
words
which
are
not
latin
at
all
for
the
rest
though
here
and
there
pages
are
illegible
and
though
some
symbols
especially
those
representing
numbers
or
chemical
compounds
are
absolutely
undecipherable
it
has
been
possible
to
effect
what
i
hope
will
be
found
a
clear
and
coherent
translation
i
have
condensed
the
narrative
but
have
not
altered
or
suppressed
a
line
for
fear
of
offending
those
who
must
be
unreasonable
indeed
if
they
lay
the
offence
to
my
charge
one
word
more
it
is
possible
if
not
likely
that
some
of
those
friends
of
the
narrator
for
whom
the
account
was
evidently
written
may
still
be
living
and
that
these
pages
may
meet
their
eyes
if
so
they
may
be
able
to
solve
the
few
problems
that
have
entirely
baffled
me
and
to
explain
if
they
so
choose
the
secrets
to
which
intentionally
or
through
the
destruction
of
its
introductory
portion
the
manuscript
affords
no
clue
i
must
add
that
these
volumes
contain
only
the
first
section
of
the
record
the
rest
relating
the
incidents
of
a
second
voyage
and
describing
another
world
remains
in
my
hands
and
should
this
part
of
the
work
excite
general
attention
the
conclusion
will
by
myself
or
by
my
executors
be
given
to
the
public
otherwise
on
my
death
it
will
be
placed
in
the
library
of
some
national
or
scientific
institution
chapter
ii
outward
bound
for
obvious
reasons
those
who
possessed
the
secret
of
the
apergy
had
never
dreamed
of
applying
it
in
the
manner
i
proposed
it
had
seemed
to
them
little
more
than
a
curious
secret
of
nature
perhaps
hardly
so
much
since
the
existence
of
a
repulsive
force
in
the
atomic
sphere
had
been
long
suspected
and
of
late
certainly
ascertained
and
its
preponderance
is
held
to
be
the
characteristic
of
the
gaseous
as
distinguished
from
the
liquid
or
solid
state
of
matter
till
lately
no
means
of
generating
or
collecting
this
force
in
large
quantity
had
been
found
the
progress
of
electrical
science
had
solved
this
difficulty
and
when
the
secret
was
communicated
to
me
it
possessed
a
value
which
had
never
before
belonged
to
it
ever
since
in
childhood
i
learnt
that
the
planets
were
worlds
a
visit
to
one
or
more
of
the
nearest
of
them
had
been
my
favourite
treasuring
every
hint
afforded
by
science
or
fancy
that
bore
upon
the
subject
i
felt
confident
that
such
a
voyage
would
be
one
day
achieved
helped
by
one
or
two
really
ingenious
romances
on
this
theme
i
had
dreamed
out
my
dream
realised
every
difficulty
ascertained
every
factor
in
the
problem
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
only
one
thing
needful
was
as
yet
wholly
beyond
the
reach
and
even
the
proximate
hopes
of
science
human
invention
could
furnish
as
yet
no
motive
power
that
could
fulfil
the
main
requirement
of
the
problem
uniform
or
constantly
increasing
motion
motion
through
a
region
affording
no
resisting
medium
this
must
be
a
energy
capable
of
acting
through
an
utter
void
man
animals
birds
fishes
move
by
repulsion
applied
at
every
moment
in
air
or
water
paddles
oars
sails
fins
wings
act
by
repulsion
exerted
on
the
fluid
element
in
which
they
work
but
in
space
there
is
no
such
resisting
element
on
which
repulsion
can
operate
i
needed
a
repulsion
which
would
act
like
gravitation
through
an
indefinite
distance
and
in
a
void
act
upon
a
remote
fulcrum
such
as
might
be
the
earth
in
a
voyage
to
the
moon
or
the
sun
in
a
more
distant
journey
as
soon
then
as
the
character
of
the
apergic
force
was
made
known
to
me
its
application
to
this
purpose
seized
on
my
mind
experiment
had
proved
it
possible
by
the
method
described
at
the
commencement
of
this
record
to
generate
and
collect
it
in
amounts
practically
unlimited
the
other
hindrances
to
a
voyage
through
space
were
trivial
in
comparison
with
that
thus
overcome
there
were
difficulties
to
be
surmounted
not
absent
or
deficient
powers
in
nature
to
be
discovered
the
chief
of
these
of
course
concerned
the
conveyance
of
air
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
the
traveller
during
the
period
of
his
journey
the
construction
of
an
vessel
was
easy
enough
but
however
large
the
body
of
air
conveyed
even
though
its
oxygen
should
not
be
exhausted
the
carbonic
acid
given
out
by
breathing
would
very
soon
so
contaminate
the
whole
that
life
would
be
impossible
to
eliminate
this
element
it
would
only
be
necessary
to
carry
a
certain
quantity
of
easily
calculated
and
by
means
of
a
fan
or
similar
instrument
to
drive
the
whole
of
the
air
periodically
through
the
vessel
containing
it
the
lime
in
solution
combining
with
the
noxious
gas
would
show
by
the
turbid
whiteness
of
the
water
the
absorption
of
the
carbonic
acid
and
formation
of
carbonate
of
lime
but
if
the
carbonic
acid
gas
were
merely
to
be
removed
it
is
obvious
that
the
oxygen
of
the
air
which
forms
a
part
of
that
gas
would
be
constantly
diminished
and
ultimately
exhausted
and
the
effect
of
highly
oxygenated
air
upon
the
circulation
is
notoriously
too
great
to
allow
of
any
considerable
increase
at
the
outset
in
the
proportion
of
this
element
i
might
carry
a
fresh
supply
of
oxygen
available
at
need
in
some
solid
combination
like
chlorate
of
potash
but
the
electricity
employed
for
the
generation
of
the
apergy
might
be
also
applied
to
the
decomposition
of
carbonic
acid
and
the
restoration
of
its
oxygen
to
the
atmosphere
but
the
vessel
had
to
be
steered
as
well
as
propelled
and
in
order
to
accomplish
this
it
would
be
necessary
to
command
the
direction
of
the
apergy
at
pleasure
my
means
of
doing
this
depended
on
two
of
the
peculiarities
of
this
strange
force
its
rectilinear
direction
and
its
conductibility
we
found
that
it
acts
through
air
or
in
a
vacuum
in
a
single
straight
line
without
deflection
and
seemingly
without
diminution
most
solids
and
especially
metals
according
to
their
electric
condition
are
more
or
less
impervious
to
it
antapergic
its
power
of
penetration
diminishes
under
a
very
obscure
law
but
so
rapidly
that
no
conceivable
strength
of
current
would
affect
an
object
protected
by
an
intervening
sheet
half
an
inch
in
thickness
on
the
other
hand
it
prefers
to
all
other
lines
the
axis
of
a
conductive
bar
such
as
may
be
formed
of
undecipherable
in
an
antapergic
sheath
however
such
bar
may
be
curved
bent
or
divided
the
current
will
fill
and
follow
it
and
pursue
indefinitely
without
divergence
diffusion
or
loss
the
direction
in
which
it
emerges
therefore
by
collecting
the
current
from
the
generator
in
a
vessel
cased
with
antapergic
material
and
leaving
no
other
aperture
its
entire
volume
might
be
sent
into
a
conductor
by
cutting
across
this
conductor
and
causing
the
further
part
to
rotate
upon
the
nearer
i
could
divert
the
current
through
any
required
angle
thus
i
could
turn
the
repulsion
upon
the
resistant
body
sun
or
planet
and
so
propel
the
vessel
in
any
direction
i
pleased
i
had
determined
that
my
first
attempt
should
be
a
visit
to
mars
the
moon
is
a
far
less
interesting
body
since
on
the
hemisphere
turned
towards
the
earth
the
absence
of
an
atmosphere
and
of
water
ensures
the
absence
of
any
such
life
as
is
known
to
us
probably
of
any
life
that
could
be
discerned
by
our
senses
and
would
prevent
landing
while
nearly
all
the
soundest
astronomers
agree
in
believing
on
apparently
sufficient
grounds
that
even
the
opposite
hemisphere
of
which
small
portions
are
from
time
to
time
rendered
visible
by
the
libration
though
greatly
foreshortened
and
consequently
somewhat
imperfectly
seen
is
equally
devoid
of
the
two
primary
necessaries
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
that
mars
has
seas
clouds
and
an
atmosphere
was
generally
admitted
and
i
held
it
to
be
beyond
question
of
venus
owing
to
her
extraordinary
brilliancy
to
the
fact
that
when
nearest
to
the
earth
a
very
small
portion
of
her
lighted
surface
is
visible
to
us
and
above
all
to
her
dense
very
little
was
known
and
though
i
cherished
the
intention
to
visit
her
even
more
earnestly
than
my
resolve
to
reach
the
probably
less
attractive
planet
mars
i
determined
to
begin
with
that
voyage
of
which
the
conditions
and
the
probable
result
were
most
obvious
and
certain
i
preferred
moreover
in
the
first
instance
to
employ
the
apergy
as
a
propelling
rather
than
as
a
resisting
force
now
after
passing
beyond
the
immediate
sphere
of
the
earth
attraction
it
is
plain
that
in
going
towards
mars
i
should
be
departing
from
the
sun
relying
upon
the
apergy
to
overcome
his
attraction
whereas
in
seeking
to
attain
venus
i
should
be
approaching
the
sun
relying
for
my
main
motive
power
upon
that
tremendous
attraction
and
employing
the
apergy
only
to
moderate
the
rate
of
movement
and
control
its
direction
the
latter
appeared
to
me
the
more
delicate
difficult
and
perhaps
dangerous
task
of
the
two
and
i
resolved
to
defer
it
until
after
i
had
acquired
some
practical
experience
and
dexterity
in
the
control
of
my
machinery
it
was
expedient
of
course
to
make
my
vessel
as
light
as
possible
and
at
the
same
time
as
large
as
considerations
of
weight
would
admit
but
it
was
of
paramount
importance
to
have
walls
of
great
thickness
in
order
to
prevent
the
penetration
of
the
outer
cold
of
space
or
rather
the
outward
passage
into
that
intense
cold
of
the
heat
generated
within
the
vessel
itself
as
well
as
to
resist
the
tremendous
outward
pressure
of
the
air
inside
partly
for
these
reasons
and
partly
because
its
electric
character
makes
it
especially
capable
of
being
rendered
at
will
pervious
or
impervious
to
the
apergic
current
i
resolved
to
make
the
outer
and
inner
walls
of
an
alloy
of
while
the
space
between
should
be
filled
up
with
a
mass
of
concrete
or
cement
in
its
nature
less
penetrable
to
heat
than
any
other
substance
which
nature
has
furnished
or
the
wit
of
man
constructed
from
her
materials
the
materials
of
this
cement
and
their
proportions
were
as
follows
briefly
having
determined
to
take
advantage
of
the
approaching
opposition
of
mars
in
mdcccxx
i
had
my
vessel
constructed
with
walls
three
feet
thick
of
which
the
outer
six
and
the
inner
three
inches
were
formed
of
the
metalloid
in
shape
my
astronaut
somewhat
resembled
the
form
of
an
antique
dutch
being
widest
and
longest
in
a
plane
equidistant
from
floor
and
ceiling
the
sides
and
ends
sloping
outwards
from
the
floor
and
again
inwards
towards
the
roof
the
deck
and
keel
however
were
absolutely
flat
and
each
one
hundred
feet
in
length
and
fifty
in
breadth
the
height
of
the
vessel
being
about
twenty
feet
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
and
in
that
of
the
roof
respectively
i
placed
a
large
lens
of
crystal
intended
to
act
as
a
window
in
the
first
instance
the
lower
to
admit
the
rays
of
the
sun
while
through
the
upper
i
should
discern
the
star
towards
which
i
was
steering
the
floor
being
much
heavier
than
the
rest
of
the
vessel
would
naturally
be
turned
downwards
that
is
during
the
greater
part
of
the
voyage
towards
the
sun
i
placed
a
similar
lens
in
the
centre
of
each
of
the
four
sides
with
two
plane
windows
of
the
same
material
one
in
the
upper
the
other
in
the
lower
half
of
the
wall
to
enable
me
to
discern
any
object
in
whatever
direction
the
crystal
in
question
consisted
of
which
as
those
who
manufactured
it
for
me
are
aware
admits
of
being
cast
with
a
perfection
and
equality
of
structure
throughout
unattainable
with
ordinary
glass
and
wrought
to
a
certainty
and
accuracy
of
curvature
which
the
most
patient
and
laborious
polishing
can
hardly
give
to
the
lenses
even
of
telescopes
whether
made
of
glass
or
metal
and
is
singularly
impervious
to
heat
i
had
so
calculated
the
curvature
that
several
of
different
magnifying
powers
which
i
carried
with
me
might
be
adapted
equally
to
any
of
the
window
lenses
and
throw
a
perfect
image
magnified
by
or
upon
mirrors
properly
placed
i
carpeted
the
floor
with
several
alternate
layers
of
cork
and
cloth
at
one
end
i
placed
my
couch
table
bookshelves
and
other
necessary
furniture
with
all
the
stores
needed
for
my
voyage
and
with
a
further
weight
sufficient
to
preserve
equilibrium
at
the
other
i
made
a
garden
with
soil
three
feet
deep
and
five
feet
in
width
divided
into
two
parts
so
as
to
permit
access
to
the
windows
i
filled
each
garden
closely
with
shrubs
and
flowering
plants
of
the
greatest
possible
variety
partly
to
absorb
animal
waste
partly
in
the
hope
of
naturalising
them
elsewhere
covering
both
with
wire
netting
extending
from
the
roof
to
the
floor
i
filled
the
cages
thus
formed
with
a
variety
of
birds
in
the
centre
of
the
vessel
was
the
machinery
occupying
altogether
a
space
of
about
thirty
feet
by
twenty
the
larger
portion
of
this
area
was
of
course
taken
up
by
the
generator
above
which
was
the
receptacle
of
the
apergy
from
this
descended
right
through
the
floor
a
conducting
bar
in
an
antapergic
sheath
so
divided
that
without
separating
it
from
the
upper
portion
the
lower
might
revolve
in
any
direction
through
an
angle
of
twenty
minutes
this
of
course
was
intended
to
direct
the
stream
of
the
repulsive
force
against
the
sun
the
angle
might
have
been
extended
to
thirty
minutes
but
that
i
deemed
it
inexpedient
to
rely
upon
a
force
directed
against
the
outer
portions
of
the
sun
disc
believing
that
these
are
occupied
by
matter
of
density
so
small
that
it
might
afford
no
sufficient
base
so
to
speak
for
the
repulsive
action
it
was
obviously
necessary
also
to
repel
or
counteract
the
attraction
of
any
body
which
might
come
near
me
during
the
voyage
again
in
getting
free
from
the
earth
influence
i
must
be
able
to
steer
in
any
direction
and
at
any
angle
to
the
surface
for
this
purpose
i
placed
five
smaller
bars
passing
through
the
roof
and
four
sides
connected
like
the
main
conductor
with
the
receptacle
or
apergion
but
so
that
they
could
revolve
through
a
much
larger
angle
and
could
at
any
moment
be
detached
and
insulated
my
steering
apparatus
consisted
of
a
table
in
which
were
three
large
circles
the
midmost
and
left
hand
of
these
were
occupied
by
accurately
polished
plane
mirrors
the
central
circle
or
metacompass
was
divided
by
three
hundred
and
sixty
fine
lines
radiating
from
the
centre
to
the
circumference
marking
as
many
different
directions
each
deviating
by
one
degree
of
arc
from
the
next
this
mirror
was
to
receive
through
the
lens
in
the
roof
the
image
of
the
star
towards
which
i
was
steering
while
this
remained
stationary
in
the
centre
all
was
well
when
it
moved
along
any
one
of
the
lines
the
vessel
was
obviously
deviating
from
her
course
in
the
opposite
direction
and
to
recover
the
right
course
the
repellent
force
must
be
caused
to
drive
her
in
the
direction
in
which
the
image
had
moved
to
accomplish
this
a
helm
was
attached
to
the
lower
division
of
the
main
conductor
by
which
the
latter
could
be
made
to
move
at
will
in
any
direction
within
the
limit
of
its
rotation
controlling
this
helm
was
in
the
open
or
steering
circle
on
the
right
hand
a
small
knob
to
be
moved
exactly
parallel
to
the
deviation
of
the
star
in
the
mirror
of
the
metacompass
the
circle
or
discometer
was
divided
by
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
concentric
circles
equidistant
from
each
other
the
outermost
about
twice
as
far
from
the
centre
as
from
the
external
edge
of
the
mirror
was
exactly
equal
to
the
sun
circumference
when
presenting
the
largest
disc
he
ever
shows
to
an
observer
on
earth
each
inner
circle
corresponded
to
a
diameter
reduced
by
one
second
by
means
of
a
vernier
or
the
diameter
of
the
sun
could
be
read
off
the
discometer
and
from
his
diameter
my
distance
could
be
accurately
calculated
on
the
further
side
of
the
machinery
was
a
chamber
for
the
decomposition
of
the
carbonic
acid
through
which
the
air
was
driven
by
a
fan
this
fan
itself
was
worked
by
a
horizontal
wheel
with
two
projecting
squares
of
antapergic
metal
against
each
of
which
as
it
reached
a
certain
point
a
very
small
stream
of
repulsive
force
was
directed
from
the
apergion
keeping
the
wheel
in
constant
and
rapid
motion
i
had
of
course
supplied
myself
with
an
ample
store
of
compressed
vegetables
preserved
meats
milk
tea
coffee
and
a
supply
of
water
sufficient
to
last
for
double
the
period
which
the
voyage
was
expected
to
occupy
also
a
with
wires
tubes
one
of
the
lower
windows
was
made
just
large
enough
to
admit
my
person
and
after
entering
i
had
to
close
it
and
fix
it
in
its
place
firmly
with
cement
which
when
i
wished
to
quit
the
vessel
would
have
again
to
be
removed
of
course
some
months
were
occupied
in
the
manufacture
of
the
different
portions
of
the
vessel
and
her
machinery
and
sometime
more
in
their
combination
so
that
when
at
the
end
of
july
i
was
ready
to
start
the
opposition
was
rapidly
approaching
in
the
course
of
some
fifty
days
the
earth
moving
in
her
orbit
at
a
rate
of
about
eleven
hundred
miles
per
minute
would
overtake
mars
that
is
to
say
would
pass
between
him
and
the
sun
in
starting
from
the
earth
i
should
share
this
motion
i
too
should
go
eleven
hundred
miles
a
minute
in
the
same
direction
but
as
i
should
travel
along
an
orbit
constantly
widening
the
earth
would
leave
me
behind
the
apergy
had
to
make
up
for
this
as
well
as
to
carry
me
some
forty
millions
of
miles
in
a
direction
at
right
angles
to
the
former
right
outward
towards
the
orbit
of
mars
again
i
should
share
the
motion
of
that
particular
spot
of
the
earth
surface
from
which
i
rose
around
her
axis
a
motion
varying
with
the
latitude
greatest
at
the
equator
nothing
at
the
pole
this
would
whirl
me
round
and
round
the
earth
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
miles
an
hour
of
this
i
must
of
course
get
rid
as
soon
as
possible
and
when
i
should
be
rid
of
it
i
meant
to
start
at
first
right
upward
that
is
straight
away
from
the
sun
and
in
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
which
is
not
very
different
from
that
in
which
mars
also
moves
therefore
i
should
begin
my
effective
ascent
from
a
point
of
the
earth
as
far
as
possible
from
the
sun
that
is
on
the
midnight
meridian
for
the
same
reason
which
led
me
to
start
so
long
before
the
date
of
the
opposition
i
resolved
having
regard
to
the
action
of
the
rotation
on
her
axis
to
start
some
hours
before
midnight
taking
leave
then
of
the
two
friends
who
had
thus
far
assisted
me
i
entered
the
astronaut
on
the
august
about
after
sealing
up
the
and
ascertaining
carefully
that
everything
was
in
order
a
task
which
occupied
me
about
an
hour
i
set
the
generator
to
work
and
when
i
had
ascertained
that
the
apergion
was
full
and
that
the
force
was
supplied
at
the
required
rate
i
directed
the
whole
at
first
into
the
main
conductor
after
doing
this
i
turned
towards
the
lower
window
on
the
west
or
as
it
was
then
the
side
and
was
in
time
to
catch
sight
of
the
trees
on
the
hills
some
half
mile
off
and
about
two
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
my
i
should
have
said
that
i
had
considerably
compressed
my
atmosphere
and
increased
the
proportion
of
oxygen
by
about
ten
per
and
also
carried
with
me
the
means
of
reproducing
the
whole
amount
of
the
latter
in
case
of
need
among
my
instruments
was
a
so
minutely
divided
that
with
a
movable
vernier
of
the
same
power
as
the
fixed
ones
employed
to
read
the
glass
circles
i
could
discover
the
slightest
escape
of
air
in
a
very
few
seconds
the
however
remained
immovable
going
close
to
the
window
and
looking
out
i
saw
the
earth
falling
from
me
so
fast
that
within
five
minutes
after
my
departure
objects
like
trees
and
even
houses
had
become
almost
indistinguishable
to
the
naked
eye
i
had
half
expected
to
hear
the
whistling
of
the
air
as
the
vessel
rushed
upward
but
nothing
of
the
kind
was
perceptible
through
her
dense
walls
it
was
strange
to
observe
the
rapid
rise
of
the
sun
from
the
westward
still
more
remarkable
on
turning
to
the
upper
window
was
the
rapidly
blackening
aspect
of
the
sky
suddenly
everything
disappeared
except
a
brilliant
rainbow
at
some
little
distance
or
perhaps
i
should
rather
have
said
a
halo
of
more
than
ordinary
rainbow
brilliancy
since
it
occupied
not
like
the
rainbows
seen
from
below
something
less
than
half
but
nearly
of
a
circle
i
was
of
course
aware
that
i
was
passing
through
a
cloud
and
one
of
very
unusual
thickness
in
a
few
seconds
however
i
was
looking
down
upon
its
upper
surface
reflecting
from
a
thousand
broken
masses
of
vapour
at
different
levels
from
cavities
and
hillocks
of
mist
the
light
of
the
sun
white
beams
mixed
with
innumerable
rays
of
all
colours
in
a
confusion
of
indescribable
brilliancy
i
presume
that
the
total
obscuration
of
everything
outside
the
cloud
during
my
passage
through
it
was
due
to
its
extent
and
not
to
its
density
since
at
that
height
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
than
exceedingly
light
and
diffuse
looking
upward
through
the
eastern
window
i
could
now
discern
a
number
of
brighter
stars
and
at
nearly
every
moment
fresh
ones
came
into
view
on
a
constantly
darkening
background
looking
downward
to
the
west
where
alone
the
entire
landscape
lay
in
daylight
i
presently
discerned
the
outline
of
shore
and
sea
extending
over
a
semicircle
whose
radius
much
exceeded
five
hundred
miles
implying
that
i
was
about
miles
from
the
even
at
this
height
the
extent
of
my
survey
was
so
great
in
comparison
to
my
elevation
that
a
line
drawn
from
the
vessel
to
the
horizon
was
though
very
roughly
almost
parallel
to
the
surface
and
the
horizon
therefore
seemed
to
be
not
very
far
from
my
own
level
while
the
point
below
me
of
course
appeared
at
a
vast
distance
the
appearance
of
the
surface
therefore
was
as
if
the
horizon
had
been
say
some
thirty
miles
higher
than
the
centre
of
the
semicircle
bounding
my
view
and
the
area
included
in
my
prospect
had
the
form
of
a
saucer
or
shallow
bowl
but
since
the
diameter
of
the
visible
surface
increases
only
as
the
square
root
of
the
height
this
appearance
became
less
and
less
perceptible
as
i
rose
higher
it
had
taken
me
twenty
minutes
to
attain
the
elevation
of
miles
but
my
speed
was
of
course
constantly
increasing
very
much
as
the
speed
of
an
object
falling
to
the
earth
from
a
great
height
increases
and
before
ten
more
minutes
had
elapsed
i
found
myself
surrounded
by
a
blackness
nearly
absolute
except
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
which
was
still
well
above
the
sea
and
immediately
round
the
terrestrial
horizon
on
which
rested
a
ring
of
sunlit
azure
sky
broken
here
and
there
by
clouds
in
every
other
direction
i
seemed
to
be
looking
not
merely
upon
a
black
or
almost
black
sky
but
into
close
surrounding
darkness
amid
this
darkness
however
were
visible
innumerable
points
of
light
more
or
less
brilliant
the
stars
which
no
longer
seemed
to
be
spangled
over
the
surface
of
a
distant
vault
but
rather
scattered
immediately
about
me
nearer
or
farther
to
the
instinctive
apprehension
of
the
eye
as
they
were
brighter
or
fainter
scintillation
there
was
none
except
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
eastern
horizon
where
i
still
saw
them
through
a
dense
atmosphere
in
short
before
thirty
minutes
had
elapsed
since
the
start
i
was
satisfied
that
i
had
passed
entirely
out
of
the
atmosphere
and
had
entered
into
the
vacancy
of
space
if
such
a
thing
as
vacant
space
there
be
at
this
point
i
had
to
cut
off
the
greater
part
of
the
apergy
and
check
my
speed
for
reasons
that
will
be
presently
apparent
i
had
started
in
daylight
in
order
that
during
the
first
hundred
miles
of
my
ascent
i
might
have
a
clear
view
of
the
earth
surface
not
only
did
i
wish
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
but
as
i
had
to
direct
my
course
by
terrestrial
landmarks
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
be
able
to
see
these
so
as
to
determine
the
rate
and
direction
of
the
motion
and
discern
the
first
symptoms
of
any
possible
danger
but
obviously
since
my
course
lay
generally
in
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
and
for
the
present
at
least
nearly
in
the
line
joining
the
centres
of
the
earth
and
sun
it
was
desirable
that
my
real
journey
into
space
should
commence
in
the
plane
of
the
midnight
meridian
that
is
from
above
the
part
of
the
earth
surface
immediately
opposite
the
sun
i
had
to
reach
this
line
and
having
reached
it
to
remain
for
some
time
above
it
to
do
both
i
must
attain
it
if
possible
at
the
same
moment
at
which
i
secured
a
westward
impulse
just
sufficient
to
counterbalance
the
eastward
impulse
derived
from
the
rotation
of
the
earth
that
is
in
the
latitude
from
which
i
started
a
thousand
miles
an
hour
i
had
calculated
that
while
directing
through
the
main
bar
a
current
of
apergy
sufficient
to
keep
the
astronaut
at
a
fixed
elevation
i
could
easily
spare
for
the
eastward
conductor
sufficient
force
to
create
in
the
space
of
one
hour
the
impulse
required
but
that
in
the
course
of
that
hour
the
gradually
increasing
apergic
force
would
drive
me
miles
westward
now
in
six
hours
the
rotation
would
carry
an
object
close
to
its
surface
through
an
angle
of
that
is
from
the
sunset
to
the
midnight
meridian
but
the
greater
the
elevation
of
the
object
the
wider
its
orbit
round
the
earth
centre
and
the
longer
each
degree
so
that
moving
eastward
only
a
thousand
miles
an
hour
i
should
constantly
lag
behind
a
point
on
the
earth
surface
and
should
not
reach
the
midnight
meridian
till
somewhat
later
i
had
moreover
to
lose
miles
of
the
eastward
drift
during
the
last
hour
in
which
i
should
be
subject
to
it
through
the
action
of
the
apergic
force
now
an
elevation
of
miles
would
give
the
astronaut
an
orbit
on
which
would
represent
miles
in
seven
hours
i
should
be
carried
along
that
orbit
miles
eastward
by
the
impulse
my
astronaut
had
received
from
the
earth
and
driven
back
miles
by
the
apergy
so
that
at
by
my
chronometer
i
should
be
exactly
in
the
plane
of
the
midnight
meridian
or
miles
east
of
my
in
space
provided
that
i
put
the
eastward
apergic
current
in
action
exactly
at
by
the
chronometer
at
also
i
should
have
generated
a
westward
impulse
of
miles
an
hour
this
once
created
would
continue
to
exist
though
the
force
that
created
it
were
cut
off
and
would
exactly
counterbalance
the
opposite
rotation
impulse
derived
from
the
earth
so
that
thenceforward
i
should
be
entirely
free
from
the
influence
of
the
latter
though
still
sharing
that
motion
of
the
earth
through
space
at
the
rate
of
nearly
nineteen
miles
per
second
which
would
carry
me
towards
the
line
joining
at
the
moment
of
opposition
her
centre
with
that
of
mars
all
went
as
i
had
calculated
i
contrived
to
arrest
the
motion
at
the
required
elevation
just
about
the
moment
of
sunset
on
the
region
of
the
earth
immediately
underneath
at
or
by
the
chronometer
i
directed
a
current
of
the
requisite
strength
into
the
eastward
conductor
which
i
had
previously
pointed
to
the
surface
but
a
little
short
of
the
extreme
terrestrial
horizon
as
i
calculated
it
at
i
found
myself
judging
by
the
stars
exactly
where
i
wished
to
be
and
nearly
stationary
as
regarded
the
earth
i
instantly
arrested
the
eastward
current
detaching
that
conductor
from
the
apergion
and
directing
the
whole
force
of
the
current
into
the
downward
conductor
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
that
after
a
very
little
adjustment
of
the
helm
the
stars
remained
stationary
in
the
mirror
of
the
metacompass
showing
that
i
had
escaped
from
the
influence
of
the
earth
rotation
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
measure
the
distance
traversed
during
the
invisibility
of
the
earth
but
i
reckoned
that
i
had
made
above
miles
between
and
and
that
at
i
was
not
less
than
miles
from
the
surface
with
this
inference
the
indication
of
my
barycrite
substantially
agreed
the
latter
instrument
consisted
of
a
spring
whose
deflection
by
a
given
weight
upon
the
equator
had
been
very
carefully
tested
gravity
diminishing
as
the
square
of
the
distance
from
the
centre
it
was
obvious
that
at
about
miles
or
above
the
surface
this
spring
would
be
deflected
only
one
quarter
as
much
by
a
given
weight
as
on
earth
at
miles
from
the
surface
or
from
the
centre
as
much
and
so
on
i
had
graduated
the
scale
accordingly
and
it
indicated
at
present
a
distance
somewhat
less
than
miles
from
the
centre
having
adjusted
the
helm
and
set
the
alarum
to
wake
me
in
six
hours
i
lay
down
upon
my
bed
the
anxiety
and
peril
of
my
position
had
disturbed
me
very
little
whilst
i
was
actively
engaged
either
in
steering
and
manipulating
my
machinery
or
in
looking
upon
the
marvellous
and
novel
spectacles
presented
to
my
eyes
but
it
now
oppressed
me
in
my
sleep
and
caused
me
frequently
to
wake
from
dreams
of
a
hideous
character
two
or
three
times
on
such
awaking
i
went
to
examine
the
metacompass
and
on
one
occasion
found
it
necessary
slightly
to
readjust
the
helm
the
stars
by
which
i
steered
having
moved
some
second
or
two
to
the
right
of
their
proper
position
on
rising
i
completed
the
circuit
which
filled
my
vessel
with
brilliant
light
emitted
from
an
electric
lamp
at
the
upper
part
of
the
stern
and
reflected
by
the
polished
metallic
walls
i
then
proceeded
to
get
my
breakfast
for
which
as
i
had
tasted
nothing
since
some
hours
before
the
start
i
had
a
hearty
appetite
i
had
anticipated
some
trouble
from
the
diminished
action
of
gravity
doubting
whether
the
at
this
immense
height
above
the
earth
might
not
be
affected
but
i
found
that
this
depends
upon
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
alone
and
that
this
pressure
was
in
nowise
affected
by
the
absence
of
gravity
my
atmosphere
being
somewhat
denser
than
that
of
the
earth
the
was
not
but
cent
the
temperature
of
the
interior
of
the
vessel
taken
at
a
point
equidistant
from
the
stove
and
from
the
walls
was
about
unpleasantly
cool
but
still
with
the
help
of
a
greatcoat
not
inconveniently
so
i
found
it
absolutely
impossible
to
measure
by
means
of
the
thermometers
i
had
placed
outside
the
windows
the
cold
of
space
but
that
it
falls
far
short
of
the
extreme
supposed
by
some
writers
i
confidently
believe
it
is
however
cold
enough
to
freeze
mercury
and
to
reduce
every
other
substance
employed
as
a
test
of
atmospheric
or
laboratory
temperatures
to
a
solidity
which
admits
of
no
further
contraction
i
had
filled
one
outside
thermometer
with
spirit
but
this
was
broken
before
i
looked
at
it
and
in
another
whose
bulb
unfortunately
was
blackened
and
which
was
filled
with
carbonic
acid
gas
an
apparent
vacuum
had
been
created
was
it
that
the
gas
had
been
frozen
and
had
sunk
into
the
lower
part
of
the
bulb
where
it
would
of
course
be
invisible
when
i
had
completed
my
meal
and
smoked
the
very
small
cigar
which
alone
a
prudent
consideration
for
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
would
allow
me
the
chronometer
showed
it
was
not
surprising
that
by
this
time
weight
had
become
almost
my
twelve
stone
had
dwindled
to
the
weight
of
a
small
fowl
and
hooking
my
little
finger
into
the
loop
of
a
string
hung
from
a
peg
fixed
near
the
top
of
the
stern
wall
i
found
myself
able
thus
to
support
my
weight
without
any
sense
of
fatigue
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
in
fact
i
felt
during
that
time
absolutely
no
sense
of
muscular
weariness
this
state
of
things
entailed
only
one
inconvenience
nothing
had
any
stability
so
that
the
slightest
push
or
jerk
would
upset
everything
that
was
not
fixed
however
i
had
so
far
anticipated
this
that
nothing
of
any
material
consequence
was
unfixed
and
except
that
a
touch
with
my
spoon
upset
the
and
egg
on
which
i
was
about
to
breakfast
and
that
this
falling
against
a
breakfast
cup
full
of
coffee
overturned
that
i
was
not
incommoded
i
managed
to
save
the
greater
part
of
the
beverage
since
the
atmospheric
pressure
being
the
same
though
the
weight
was
so
changed
lead
and
still
more
china
or
liquid
fell
in
the
astronaut
as
slowly
as
feathers
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
earth
still
it
was
a
novel
experience
to
find
myself
able
to
lean
in
any
direction
and
rest
in
almost
any
posture
with
but
the
slightest
support
for
the
body
centre
of
gravity
and
further
to
find
on
experiment
that
it
was
possible
to
remain
for
a
couple
of
hours
with
my
heels
above
my
head
in
the
favourite
position
of
a
yankee
lower
limbs
without
any
perceptible
congestion
of
blood
or
confusion
of
brain
i
was
occupied
all
day
with
abstract
calculations
and
knowing
that
for
some
time
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
earth
her
dark
side
being
opposite
me
and
wholly
obscuring
the
sun
while
i
was
as
yet
far
from
having
entered
within
the
sphere
where
any
novel
celestial
phenomena
might
be
expected
i
only
gave
an
occasional
glance
at
the
discometer
and
metacompass
suppressing
of
course
the
electric
glare
within
my
vessel
till
i
awoke
from
a
short
siesta
about
the
earth
at
this
time
occupied
on
the
sphere
of
view
a
space
defined
at
first
only
by
the
absence
of
stars
about
thirty
times
greater
than
the
disc
of
the
moon
as
seen
through
a
tube
but
being
dark
scarcely
seemed
larger
to
the
eye
than
the
full
moon
when
on
the
horizon
but
a
new
method
of
defining
its
disc
was
presently
afforded
me
i
was
in
fact
when
looking
through
the
lower
window
in
the
same
position
as
regards
the
earth
as
would
be
an
inhabitant
of
the
lunar
hemisphere
turned
towards
her
having
no
external
atmosphere
interposed
between
us
but
being
at
about
of
the
lunar
distance
and
as
during
an
eclipse
the
lunarian
would
see
round
the
earth
a
halo
created
by
the
refraction
of
the
sun
rays
in
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
a
halo
bright
enough
on
most
occasions
so
to
illuminate
the
moon
as
to
render
her
visible
to
us
so
to
my
eyes
the
earth
was
surrounded
by
a
halo
somewhat
resembling
the
solar
corona
as
seen
in
eclipses
if
not
nearly
so
brilliant
but
unlike
the
solar
corona
coloured
with
a
preponderance
of
red
so
decided
as
fully
to
account
for
the
peculiar
hue
of
the
eclipsed
moon
to
paint
this
unless
means
of
painting
light
the
one
great
deficiency
which
is
still
the
opprobrium
of
human
art
were
discovered
would
task
to
the
uttermost
the
powers
of
the
ablest
artist
and
at
best
he
could
give
but
a
very
imperfect
notion
of
it
to
describe
it
so
that
its
beauty
brilliancy
and
wondrous
nature
shall
be
in
the
slightest
degree
appreciated
by
my
readers
would
require
a
command
of
words
such
as
no
poet
since
homer
nay
not
homer
himself
possessed
what
was
strange
and
can
perhaps
be
rendered
intelligible
was
the
variation
or
to
use
a
phrase
more
suggestive
and
more
natural
if
not
more
accurate
the
extreme
mobility
of
the
hues
of
this
earthly
corona
there
were
none
of
the
efflorescences
if
one
may
so
term
them
which
are
so
generally
visible
at
four
cardinal
points
of
its
solar
prototype
the
outer
portion
of
the
band
faded
very
rapidly
into
the
darkness
of
space
but
the
edge
though
absolutely
undefined
was
perfectly
even
but
on
the
generally
ground
suffused
with
red
which
perhaps
might
best
be
described
by
calling
it
a
rainbow
seen
on
a
background
of
brilliant
crimson
there
were
here
and
there
blotches
of
black
or
of
lighter
or
darker
grey
caused
apparently
by
vast
expanses
of
cloud
more
or
less
dense
round
the
edges
of
each
of
these
were
little
irregular
halos
of
their
own
interrupting
and
variegating
the
continuous
bands
of
the
corona
while
throughout
all
was
discernible
a
perpetual
variability
like
the
flashing
or
shooting
of
colour
in
the
opal
the
or
similarly
tinted
translucent
substances
when
exposed
to
the
irregular
play
of
bright
light
only
that
in
this
case
the
tints
were
incomparably
more
brilliant
the
change
more
striking
if
not
more
rapid
i
could
not
say
that
at
any
particular
moment
any
point
or
part
of
the
surface
presented
this
or
that
definite
hue
and
yet
the
general
character
of
the
rainbow
suffused
with
or
backed
by
crimson
was
constant
and
unmistakable
the
light
sent
through
the
window
was
too
dim
and
too
imperfectly
diffused
within
my
vessel
to
be
serviceable
but
for
some
time
i
put
out
the
electric
lamp
in
order
that
its
diffused
light
should
not
impair
my
view
of
this
exquisite
spectacle
as
thrown
after
several
reflections
upon
the
mirror
destined
afterwards
to
measure
the
image
of
the
solar
disc
the
apparition
of
the
halo
was
of
course
much
less
bright
and
its
outer
boundary
ill
defined
for
accurate
measurement
the
inner
edge
where
the
light
was
bounded
by
the
black
disc
of
the
earth
shaded
off
much
more
quickly
from
dark
reddish
purple
into
absolute
blackness
and
now
a
surprise
the
first
i
had
encountered
awaited
me
i
registered
the
gravity
as
shown
by
the
barycrite
and
extinguishing
the
electric
lamp
measured
repeatedly
the
of
the
earth
and
of
the
halo
around
her
upon
the
discometer
the
inner
edge
of
the
latter
affording
the
measurement
of
the
black
disc
which
of
itself
of
course
cast
no
reflection
i
saw
at
once
that
there
was
a
signal
difference
in
the
two
indications
and
proceeded
carefully
to
revise
the
on
the
average
of
thirteen
measures
the
halo
was
about
or
nearly
in
breadth
the
disc
allowing
for
the
twilight
round
its
edge
or
limb
about
if
the
refracting
atmosphere
were
some
miles
in
depth
these
proportions
were
correct
relighting
the
lamp
i
worked
out
severally
on
paper
the
results
indicated
by
the
two
instruments
the
discometer
gave
a
distance
roughly
speaking
of
terrestrial
radii
or
miles
the
barycrite
should
have
shown
a
gravity
due
to
the
attraction
not
but
times
less
than
that
prevailing
on
the
earth
surface
or
to
put
it
in
a
less
accurate
form
a
weight
of
lbs
should
have
weighed
an
ounce
it
did
weigh
two
ounces
the
gravity
being
not
one
but
one
of
terrestrial
gravity
or
just
double
what
i
expected
i
puzzled
myself
over
this
matter
longer
probably
than
the
intelligent
reader
will
do
the
explanation
being
obvious
like
that
of
many
puzzles
that
bewilder
our
minds
intensely
only
to
humiliate
us
proportionately
when
the
solution
is
found
a
solution
as
simple
as
that
of
columbus
at
length
finding
that
the
lunar
angle
the
apparent
position
of
the
moon
confirmed
the
reading
of
the
discometer
giving
the
same
apogaic
distance
or
elevation
i
supposed
that
the
barycrite
must
be
out
of
order
or
subject
to
some
unsuspected
law
of
which
future
observations
might
afford
evidence
and
explanation
and
turned
to
other
subjects
of
interest
looking
through
the
upper
window
on
the
left
i
was
struck
by
the
rapid
enlargement
of
a
star
which
when
i
first
noticed
it
might
be
of
the
third
magnitude
but
which
in
less
than
a
minute
attained
the
first
and
in
a
minute
more
was
as
large
as
the
planet
jupiter
when
seen
with
a
magnifying
power
of
one
hundred
diameters
its
disc
however
had
no
continuous
outline
and
as
it
approached
i
perceived
that
it
was
an
irregular
mass
of
whose
size
i
could
form
not
even
a
conjectural
estimate
since
its
distance
must
be
absolutely
uncertain
its
brilliancy
grew
fainter
in
proportion
to
the
enlargement
as
it
approached
proving
that
its
light
was
reflected
and
as
it
passed
me
apparently
in
the
direction
of
the
earth
i
had
a
sufficiently
distinct
view
of
it
to
know
that
it
was
a
mainly
metallic
mass
certainly
of
some
size
perhaps
four
perhaps
twenty
feet
in
diameter
and
apparently
composed
chiefly
of
iron
showing
a
more
or
less
blistered
surface
but
with
angles
sharper
and
faces
more
regularly
defined
than
most
of
those
which
have
been
found
upon
the
earth
surface
as
if
the
shape
of
the
latter
might
be
due
in
part
to
the
conflagration
they
undergo
in
passing
at
such
tremendous
speed
through
the
atmosphere
or
in
an
opposite
sense
to
the
fractures
caused
by
the
shock
of
their
falling
though
i
made
no
attempt
to
count
the
innumerable
stars
in
the
midst
of
which
i
appeared
to
float
i
was
convinced
that
their
number
was
infinitely
greater
than
that
visible
to
the
naked
eye
on
the
brightest
night
i
remembered
how
greatly
the
inexperienced
eye
exaggerates
the
number
of
stars
visible
from
the
earth
since
poets
and
even
olden
observers
liken
their
number
to
that
of
the
sands
on
the
seashore
whereas
the
patient
work
of
map
and
catalogue
makers
has
shown
that
there
are
but
a
few
thousands
visible
in
the
whole
heavens
to
the
keenest
unaided
sight
i
suppose
that
i
saw
a
hundred
times
that
number
in
one
word
the
sphere
of
darkness
in
which
i
floated
seemed
to
be
filled
with
points
of
light
while
the
absolute
blackness
that
surrounded
them
the
absence
of
the
slightest
radiation
or
illumination
of
space
at
large
was
strange
beyond
expression
to
an
eye
accustomed
to
that
diffusion
of
light
which
is
produced
by
the
atmosphere
i
may
mention
here
that
the
recognition
of
the
constellations
was
at
first
exceedingly
difficult
on
earth
we
see
so
few
stars
in
any
given
portion
of
the
heavens
that
one
recognises
without
an
effort
the
figure
marked
out
by
a
small
number
of
the
brightest
amongst
them
while
in
my
position
the
multitude
was
so
great
that
only
patient
and
repeated
effort
enabled
me
to
separate
from
the
rest
those
peculiarly
brilliant
luminaries
by
which
we
are
accustomed
to
define
such
constellations
as
orion
or
the
bear
to
say
nothing
of
those
minor
or
more
arbitrarily
drawn
figures
which
contain
few
stars
of
the
second
magnitude
the
eye
had
no
instinctive
sense
of
distance
any
star
might
have
been
within
a
stone
throw
i
need
hardly
observe
that
while
on
one
hand
the
motion
of
the
vessel
was
absolutely
imperceptible
there
was
on
the
other
no
change
of
position
among
the
stars
which
could
enable
me
to
verify
the
fact
that
i
was
moving
much
less
suggest
it
to
the
senses
the
direction
of
every
recognisable
star
was
the
same
as
on
earth
as
it
appears
the
same
from
the
two
extremities
of
the
earth
orbit
millions
of
miles
apart
looking
from
any
one
window
i
could
see
no
greater
space
of
the
heavens
than
in
looking
through
a
similar
aperture
on
earth
what
was
novel
and
interesting
in
my
stellar
prospect
was
not
merely
that
i
could
see
those
stars
north
and
south
which
are
never
visible
from
the
same
point
on
earth
except
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
equator
but
that
save
on
the
small
space
concealed
by
the
earth
disc
i
could
by
moving
from
window
to
window
survey
the
entire
heavens
looking
at
one
minute
upon
the
stars
surrounding
the
vernal
and
at
another
by
changing
my
position
upon
those
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
autumnal
equinox
by
little
more
than
a
turn
of
my
head
i
could
see
in
one
direction
polaris
ursæ
minoris
with
the
great
bear
and
in
another
the
southern
cross
the
ship
and
the
centaur
about
near
the
close
of
the
first
day
i
again
inspected
the
barycrite
it
showed
of
terrestrial
gravity
an
incredibly
small
change
from
the
recorded
at
since
it
implied
a
progress
proportionate
only
to
the
square
root
of
the
difference
the
observation
indicated
if
the
instrument
could
be
trusted
an
advance
of
only
miles
it
was
impossible
that
the
astronaut
had
not
by
this
time
attained
a
very
much
greater
speed
than
miles
an
hour
and
a
greater
distance
from
the
earth
than
terrestrial
radii
or
miles
moreover
the
barycrite
itself
had
given
at
a
distance
of
radii
and
a
speed
far
greater
than
that
which
upon
its
showing
had
since
been
maintained
extinguishing
the
lamp
i
found
that
the
earth
diameter
on
the
discometer
measured
this
represented
a
gain
of
some
miles
much
more
approximate
to
that
which
judging
by
calculation
i
ought
to
have
accomplished
during
the
last
four
hours
and
a
half
if
my
speed
approached
to
that
i
had
estimated
i
inspected
the
cratometer
which
indicated
a
force
as
great
as
that
with
which
i
had
started
a
force
which
should
by
this
time
have
given
me
a
speed
of
at
least
miles
an
hour
at
last
the
solution
of
the
problem
flashed
upon
me
suggested
by
the
very
extravagance
of
the
contradictions
not
only
did
the
barycrite
contradict
the
discometer
and
the
reckoning
but
it
contradicted
itself
since
it
was
impossible
that
under
one
continuous
impulsation
i
should
have
traversed
radii
of
the
earth
in
the
first
eighteen
hours
and
no
more
than
in
the
next
four
and
a
half
hours
in
truth
the
barycrite
was
effected
by
two
separate
attractions
that
of
the
earth
and
that
of
the
sun
as
yet
operating
almost
exactly
in
the
same
direction
at
first
the
attraction
of
the
former
was
so
great
that
that
of
the
sun
was
no
more
perceived
than
upon
the
earth
surface
but
as
i
rose
and
the
earth
attraction
diminished
in
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
distance
from
her
centre
which
was
doubled
at
miles
quadrupled
at
and
so
on
the
sun
attraction
which
was
not
perceptibly
affected
by
differences
so
small
in
proportion
to
his
vast
distance
of
miles
became
a
more
and
more
important
element
in
the
total
gravity
if
as
i
calculated
i
had
by
attained
a
distance
from
the
earth
of
miles
the
attractions
of
earth
and
sun
were
by
that
time
pretty
nearly
equal
and
hence
the
phenomenon
which
had
so
puzzled
me
that
the
gravitation
as
indicated
by
the
barycrite
was
exactly
double
that
which
bearing
in
mind
the
earth
attraction
alone
i
had
calculated
from
this
point
forward
the
sun
attraction
was
the
factor
which
mainly
caused
such
weight
as
still
existed
a
change
of
position
which
doubling
my
distance
from
the
earth
reduced
her
influence
to
not
perceptibly
affecting
that
of
a
body
four
hundred
times
more
remote
a
short
calculation
showed
that
this
fact
borne
in
mind
the
indication
of
the
barycrite
substantially
agreed
with
that
of
the
discometer
and
that
i
was
in
fact
very
nearly
where
i
supposed
that
is
a
little
farther
than
the
moon
farthest
distance
from
the
earth
it
did
not
follow
that
i
had
crossed
the
orbit
of
the
moon
and
if
i
had
she
was
at
that
time
too
far
off
to
exercise
a
serious
influence
on
my
course
i
adjusted
the
helm
and
betook
myself
to
rest
the
second
day
of
my
journey
having
already
commenced
chapter
iii
the
untravelled
deep
rising
at
i
observed
a
drooping
in
the
leaves
of
my
garden
and
especially
of
the
larger
shrubs
and
plants
for
which
i
was
not
wholly
unprepared
but
which
might
entail
some
inconvenience
if
failing
altogether
they
should
cease
to
absorb
the
gases
generated
from
buried
waste
to
consume
which
they
had
been
planted
besides
this
i
should
of
course
lose
the
opportunity
of
transplanting
them
to
mars
though
i
had
more
hope
of
acclimatising
seedlings
raised
from
the
seed
i
carried
with
me
than
plants
which
had
actually
begun
their
life
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
failure
i
ascribed
naturally
to
the
known
connection
between
the
action
of
gravity
and
the
circulation
of
the
sap
though
as
i
had
experienced
no
analogous
inconvenience
in
my
own
person
i
had
hoped
that
this
would
not
seriously
affect
vegetation
i
was
afraid
to
try
the
effect
of
more
liberal
watering
the
more
so
that
already
the
congelation
of
moisture
upon
the
glasses
from
the
internal
air
dry
as
the
latter
had
been
kept
was
a
sensible
annoyance
an
annoyance
which
would
have
become
an
insuperable
trouble
had
i
not
taken
so
much
pains
by
directing
the
thermic
currents
upon
the
walls
to
keep
the
internal
temperature
in
so
far
as
comfort
would
permit
it
had
now
fallen
to
as
near
as
possible
to
that
of
the
inner
surface
of
the
walls
and
windows
a
careful
use
of
the
thermometer
indicated
that
the
metallic
surface
of
the
former
was
now
nearly
zero
or
the
inner
surface
of
the
windows
was
somewhat
colder
showing
that
the
crystal
was
more
pervious
to
heat
than
the
walls
with
their
greater
thickness
their
outer
and
inner
lining
of
metal
and
massive
interior
of
concrete
i
directed
a
current
from
the
thermogene
upon
either
division
of
the
garden
hoping
thus
to
protect
the
plants
from
whatever
injury
they
might
receive
from
the
cold
somewhat
later
perceiving
that
the
drooping
still
continued
i
resolved
upon
another
experiment
and
arranging
an
apparatus
of
copper
wire
beneath
the
soil
so
as
to
bring
the
extremities
in
immediate
contact
with
their
roots
i
directed
through
these
wires
a
prolonged
feeble
current
of
electricity
by
which
as
i
had
hoped
rather
than
expected
the
plants
were
after
a
time
materially
benefited
and
to
which
i
believe
i
owed
it
that
they
had
not
all
perished
long
before
the
termination
of
my
voyage
it
would
be
mere
waste
of
space
and
time
were
i
to
attempt
anything
like
a
journal
of
the
weeks
i
spent
in
the
solitude
of
this
artificial
planet
as
matter
of
course
the
monotony
of
a
voyage
through
space
is
in
general
greater
than
that
of
a
voyage
across
an
ocean
like
the
atlantic
where
no
islands
and
few
ships
are
to
be
encountered
it
was
necessary
to
be
very
frequently
if
not
constantly
on
the
for
possible
incidents
of
interest
in
a
journey
so
utterly
novel
through
regions
which
the
telescope
can
but
imperfectly
explore
it
was
difficult
therefore
to
sit
down
to
a
book
or
even
to
pursue
any
necessary
occupation
unconnected
with
the
actual
conduct
of
the
vessel
with
uninterrupted
attention
my
eyes
the
only
sense
organs
i
could
employ
were
constantly
on
the
alert
but
of
course
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
my
time
passed
without
a
single
new
object
or
occasion
of
remark
that
a
journey
so
utterly
without
precedent
or
parallel
in
which
so
little
could
be
anticipated
or
provided
for
through
regions
absolutely
untraversed
and
very
nearly
unknown
should
be
monotonous
may
seem
strange
but
in
truth
the
novelties
of
the
situation
such
as
they
were
though
intensely
striking
and
interesting
were
each
in
turn
speedily
examined
realised
and
so
to
speak
exhausted
and
this
once
done
there
was
no
greater
occupation
to
the
mind
in
the
continuance
of
strange
than
in
that
of
familiar
scenery
the
infinitude
of
surrounding
blackness
filled
as
it
were
with
points
of
light
more
or
less
brilliant
when
once
its
effects
had
been
scrutinised
and
when
nothing
more
remained
to
be
noted
afforded
certainly
a
more
agreeable
but
scarcely
a
more
interesting
or
absorbing
outlook
than
the
dead
grey
circle
of
sea
the
dead
grey
hemisphere
of
cloud
which
form
the
prospect
from
the
deck
of
a
packet
in
while
of
change
without
or
incident
in
the
vessel
herself
there
was
of
course
infinitely
less
than
is
afforded
in
an
ocean
voyage
by
the
variations
of
weather
not
to
mention
the
solace
of
human
society
everything
around
me
except
in
the
one
direction
in
which
the
earth
disc
still
obscured
the
sun
remained
unchanged
for
hours
and
days
and
the
management
of
my
machinery
required
no
more
than
an
occasional
observation
of
my
instruments
and
a
change
in
the
position
of
the
helm
which
occupied
but
a
few
minutes
some
times
in
the
hours
there
was
not
even
the
change
of
night
and
day
of
sun
and
stars
of
cloud
or
clear
sky
were
i
to
describe
the
manner
in
which
each
day
leisure
was
spent
i
should
bore
my
readers
even
more
than
they
will
perhaps
be
surprised
by
the
confession
i
was
bored
myself
my
sleep
was
of
necessity
more
or
less
broken
i
wished
to
have
eight
hours
of
rest
since
though
seven
of
continuous
sleep
might
well
have
sufficed
me
even
if
my
brain
had
been
less
quiet
and
unexcited
during
the
rest
of
the
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
enjoy
that
term
of
unbroken
slumber
i
therefore
decided
to
divide
my
sleep
into
two
portions
of
rather
more
than
four
hours
each
to
be
taken
as
a
rule
after
noon
and
after
midnight
or
rather
since
noon
and
midnight
had
no
meaning
for
me
from
to
and
from
to
but
of
course
sleep
and
everything
else
except
the
necessary
management
of
the
machine
must
give
way
to
the
chances
of
observation
it
would
be
better
to
remain
awake
for
hours
at
a
stretch
than
to
miss
any
important
phenomenon
the
period
of
whose
occurrence
could
be
even
remotely
calculated
at
i
employed
for
the
first
time
the
apparatus
which
i
may
call
my
window
telescope
to
observe
from
a
position
free
from
the
difficulties
inflicted
on
terrestrial
astronomers
by
the
atmosphere
all
the
celestial
objects
within
my
survey
as
i
had
anticipated
the
absence
of
atmospheric
disturbance
and
diffusion
of
light
was
of
extreme
advantage
in
the
first
place
i
ascertained
by
the
barycrite
and
the
discometer
my
distance
from
the
earth
which
appeared
to
be
about
terrestrial
radii
the
light
of
the
halo
was
of
course
very
much
narrower
than
when
i
first
observed
it
and
its
scintillations
or
coruscations
no
longer
distinctly
visible
the
moon
presented
an
exquisitely
fine
thread
of
light
but
no
new
object
of
interest
on
the
very
small
portion
of
her
daylight
hemisphere
turned
towards
me
mars
was
somewhat
difficult
to
observe
being
too
near
what
may
be
called
my
zenith
but
the
markings
were
far
more
distinct
than
they
appear
with
greater
magnifying
powers
than
i
employed
upon
the
earth
in
truth
i
should
say
that
the
various
disadvantages
due
to
the
atmosphere
deprive
the
astronomer
of
at
least
of
the
available
power
of
his
telescope
and
consequently
of
the
defining
power
of
the
that
with
a
glass
he
sees
less
than
a
power
of
reveals
to
an
eye
situated
in
space
though
from
the
nature
of
the
lens
through
which
i
looked
i
can
not
speak
with
certainty
upon
this
point
with
a
magnifying
power
of
the
polar
spots
of
mars
were
distinctly
visible
and
perfectly
defined
they
were
i
thought
less
white
than
they
appeared
from
the
earth
but
their
colour
was
notably
different
from
that
of
the
general
surface
differing
almost
as
widely
from
the
orange
hue
of
what
i
supposed
to
be
land
as
from
the
greyish
blue
of
the
water
the
orange
was
i
thought
deeper
than
it
appears
through
a
telescope
of
similar
power
on
earth
the
seas
were
distinctly
grey
rather
than
blue
especially
when
by
covering
the
greater
part
of
the
field
i
contrived
for
a
moment
to
observe
a
sea
alone
thus
eliminating
the
effect
of
contrast
the
bands
of
jupiter
in
their
turn
were
more
notably
distinct
their
variety
of
colour
as
well
as
the
contrast
of
light
and
shade
much
more
definite
and
their
irregularities
more
unmistakable
a
satellite
was
approaching
the
disc
and
this
afforded
me
an
opportunity
of
realising
with
especial
clearness
the
difference
between
observation
through
seventy
or
a
hundred
miles
of
terrestrial
atmosphere
outside
the
object
glass
and
observation
in
space
the
two
discs
were
perfectly
rounded
and
separately
discernible
until
they
touched
moreover
i
was
able
to
distinguish
upon
one
of
the
darker
bands
the
disc
of
the
satellite
itself
while
upon
a
lighter
band
its
round
black
shadow
was
at
the
same
time
perfectly
defined
this
wonderfully
clear
presentation
of
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
astronomical
phenomena
so
absorbed
my
attention
that
i
watched
the
satellite
and
shadow
during
their
whole
course
though
the
former
passing
after
a
time
on
to
a
light
band
became
comparatively
indistinct
the
moment
however
that
the
outer
edge
passed
off
the
disc
of
jupiter
its
outline
became
perfectly
visible
against
the
black
background
of
sky
what
was
still
more
novel
was
the
occultation
for
some
little
time
of
a
star
apparently
of
the
tenth
magnitude
not
by
the
planet
but
by
the
satellite
almost
immediately
after
it
passed
off
the
disc
of
the
former
whether
the
star
actually
disappeared
at
once
as
if
instantaneously
extinguished
or
whether
as
i
thought
at
the
moment
it
remained
for
some
tenth
of
a
second
partially
visible
as
if
refracted
by
an
atmosphere
belonging
to
the
satellite
i
will
not
venture
to
say
the
bands
and
rings
of
saturn
the
division
between
the
two
latter
and
the
seven
satellites
were
also
perfectly
visible
with
a
distinctness
that
a
much
greater
magnifying
power
would
hardly
have
attained
under
terrestrial
conditions
i
was
perplexed
by
two
peculiarities
not
so
far
as
i
know
hitherto
mentioned
by
astronomers
the
circumference
did
not
appear
to
present
an
even
curvature
i
mean
that
apart
from
the
polar
compression
the
shape
seemed
as
if
the
spheroid
were
irregularly
squeezed
so
that
though
not
broken
by
projection
or
indentation
the
limb
did
not
present
the
regular
curvature
exhibited
in
the
focus
of
our
telescopes
also
between
the
inner
ring
and
the
planet
with
a
power
of
i
discerned
what
appeared
to
be
a
dark
purplish
ring
so
that
through
it
the
bright
surface
of
saturn
might
be
discerned
as
through
a
veil
mercury
shone
brightly
several
degrees
outside
the
halo
surrounding
the
earth
black
disc
and
venus
was
also
visible
but
in
neither
case
did
my
observations
allow
me
to
ascertain
anything
that
has
not
been
already
noted
by
astronomers
the
dim
form
of
uranus
was
better
defined
than
i
had
previously
seen
it
but
no
marking
of
any
kind
was
perceptible
rising
from
my
second
or
so
to
speak
midday
rest
and
having
busied
myself
for
some
little
time
with
what
i
may
call
my
household
and
garden
duties
i
observed
the
discometer
at
or
it
indicated
about
two
hundred
terrestrial
radii
of
elevation
i
had
of
course
from
the
first
been
falling
slightly
behind
the
earth
in
her
orbital
motion
and
was
no
longer
exactly
in
opposition
that
is
to
say
a
line
drawn
from
the
astronaut
to
the
earth
centre
was
no
longer
a
prolongation
of
that
joining
the
centres
of
the
earth
and
sun
the
effect
of
this
divergence
was
now
perceptible
the
earthly
corona
was
unequal
in
width
and
to
the
westward
was
very
distinctly
brightened
while
on
the
other
side
it
was
narrow
and
comparatively
faint
while
watching
this
phenomenon
through
the
lower
lens
i
thought
that
i
could
perceive
behind
or
through
the
widest
portion
of
the
halo
a
white
light
which
at
first
i
mistook
for
one
of
those
scintillations
that
had
of
late
become
scarcely
discernible
but
after
a
time
it
extended
visibly
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
halo
itself
and
i
perceived
that
the
edge
of
the
sun
disc
had
come
at
last
into
view
it
was
but
a
minute
and
narrow
crescent
but
was
well
worth
watching
the
brightening
and
broadening
of
the
halo
at
this
point
i
perceived
to
be
due
not
to
the
sun
effect
upon
the
atmosphere
that
produced
it
but
chiefly
to
the
twilight
now
brightening
on
that
limb
of
the
earth
disc
or
rather
to
the
fact
that
a
small
portion
of
that
part
of
the
earth
surface
where
if
the
sun
were
not
visible
he
was
but
a
very
little
below
the
horizon
had
been
turned
towards
me
i
saw
through
the
telescope
first
a
tiny
solar
crescent
of
intense
brightness
then
the
halo
proper
now
exceedingly
narrow
and
then
what
looked
like
a
silver
terrestrial
crescent
but
a
mere
thread
finer
and
shorter
than
any
that
the
moon
ever
displays
even
to
telescopic
observers
on
earth
since
when
such
a
minute
portion
of
her
illuminated
surface
is
turned
towards
the
earth
it
is
utterly
extinguished
to
our
eyes
by
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
sun
as
was
soon
the
case
with
the
terrestrial
crescent
in
question
i
watched
long
and
with
intense
interest
the
gradual
change
but
i
was
called
away
from
it
by
a
consideration
of
no
little
practical
moment
i
must
now
be
moving
at
a
rate
of
nearly
if
not
quite
miles
an
hour
or
about
a
million
miles
per
diem
it
was
not
my
intention
for
reasons
i
shall
presently
explain
ever
greatly
to
exceed
this
rate
and
if
i
meant
to
limit
myself
to
a
fixed
rate
of
speed
it
was
time
to
diminish
the
force
of
the
apergic
current
as
otherwise
before
its
reduction
could
take
effect
i
should
have
attained
an
impulse
greater
than
i
desired
and
which
could
not
be
conveniently
or
easily
diminished
when
once
reached
quitting
therefore
though
reluctantly
my
observation
of
the
phenomena
below
me
i
turned
to
the
apergion
and
was
occupied
for
some
two
or
three
hours
in
gradually
reducing
the
force
as
measured
by
the
cratometer
attached
to
the
downward
conductor
and
measuring
with
extreme
care
the
very
minute
effect
produced
upon
the
barycrite
and
the
discometer
even
the
difference
between
and
radii
of
elevation
or
apogaic
distance
was
not
easily
perceptible
on
either
it
took
of
course
much
more
minute
observation
and
a
much
longer
time
to
test
the
effect
produced
by
the
regulation
of
the
movement
since
whether
i
traveller
forty
or
thousand
miles
in
the
course
of
one
hour
made
scarcely
any
difference
in
the
diameter
of
the
earth
disc
still
less
for
reasons
above
given
in
the
gravity
by
midnight
however
i
was
satisfied
that
i
had
not
attained
quite
miles
or
terrestrial
radii
also
that
my
speed
was
not
greater
than
miles
radii
per
hour
and
was
not
i
thought
increasing
of
this
last
point
however
i
could
better
satisfy
myself
at
the
end
of
my
four
hours
rest
to
which
i
now
betook
myself
i
woke
about
and
on
a
scrutiny
of
the
instruments
felt
satisfied
that
i
was
not
far
out
in
my
calculations
a
later
hour
however
would
afford
a
more
absolute
certainty
i
was
about
to
turn
again
to
the
interesting
work
of
observation
through
the
lens
in
the
floor
when
my
attention
was
diverted
by
the
sight
of
something
like
a
whitish
cloud
visible
through
the
upper
window
on
my
left
hand
examined
by
the
telescope
its
widest
diameter
might
be
at
most
ten
degrees
it
was
faintly
luminous
presenting
an
appearance
very
closely
resembling
that
of
a
star
cluster
or
nebula
just
beyond
the
power
of
resolution
as
in
many
nebulae
there
was
a
visible
concentration
in
one
part
but
this
did
not
occupy
the
centre
but
a
position
more
resembling
that
of
the
nucleus
of
a
small
tailless
comet
the
cloudlet
might
be
a
distant
comet
it
might
be
a
less
distant
body
of
meteors
clustering
densely
in
some
particular
part
of
their
orbit
and
unfortunately
i
was
not
likely
to
solve
the
problem
gradually
the
nebula
changed
its
position
but
not
its
form
seeming
to
move
downwards
and
towards
the
stern
of
my
vessel
as
if
i
were
passing
it
without
approaching
nearer
by
the
time
that
i
was
satisfied
of
this
hunger
and
even
faintness
warned
me
that
i
must
not
delay
preparing
my
breakfast
when
i
had
finished
this
meal
and
fulfilled
some
necessary
tasks
practical
and
arithmetical
the
hand
of
the
chronometer
indicated
the
eighth
hour
of
my
third
day
i
turned
again
somewhat
eagerly
to
the
discometer
which
showed
an
apparent
distance
of
terrestrial
radii
and
consequently
a
movement
which
had
not
materially
varied
from
the
rate
of
radii
per
hour
by
this
time
the
diameter
of
the
earth
was
not
larger
in
appearance
than
about
less
than
that
of
the
sun
and
she
consequently
appeared
as
a
black
disc
covering
somewhat
more
than
of
his
entire
surface
but
by
no
means
concentrical
the
halo
had
of
course
completely
disappeared
but
with
the
vernier
it
was
possible
to
discern
a
narrow
band
or
line
of
hazy
grey
around
the
black
limb
of
the
planet
she
was
moving
as
seen
from
the
astronaut
very
slightly
to
the
north
and
more
decidedly
though
very
slowly
to
the
eastward
the
one
motion
due
to
my
deliberately
chosen
direction
in
space
the
other
to
the
fact
that
as
my
orbit
enlarged
i
was
falling
though
as
yet
slowly
behind
her
the
sun
now
shone
through
the
various
windows
and
reflected
from
the
walls
maintained
a
continuous
daylight
within
the
astronaut
as
well
diffused
as
by
the
atmosphere
of
earth
strangely
contrasting
the
darkness
outside
at
the
beginning
as
at
the
end
of
my
voyage
i
steered
a
distinct
course
governed
by
considerations
quite
different
from
those
which
controlled
the
main
direction
of
my
voyage
thus
far
i
had
simply
risen
straight
from
the
earth
in
a
direction
somewhat
to
the
southward
but
on
the
whole
in
opposition
or
right
away
from
the
sun
so
at
the
conclusion
of
my
journey
i
should
have
to
devote
some
days
to
a
gradual
descent
upon
mars
exactly
reversing
the
process
of
my
ascent
from
the
earth
but
between
these
two
periods
i
had
comparatively
little
to
do
with
either
planet
my
course
being
governed
by
the
sun
and
its
direction
and
rate
being
uniform
i
wished
to
reach
mars
at
the
moment
of
opposition
and
during
the
whole
of
the
journey
to
keep
the
earth
between
myself
and
the
sun
for
a
reason
which
may
not
at
first
be
obvious
the
moment
of
opposition
is
not
necessarily
that
at
which
mars
is
nearest
to
the
earth
but
is
sufficiently
so
for
practical
calculation
at
that
moment
according
to
the
received
measurement
of
planetary
distances
the
two
would
be
more
than
millions
of
miles
apart
in
the
meantime
the
earth
travelling
on
an
interior
or
smaller
orbit
and
also
at
a
greater
absolute
speed
was
gaining
on
mars
the
astronaut
moving
at
the
earth
rate
under
an
impulse
derived
from
the
earth
revolution
round
the
sun
that
due
to
her
rotation
on
her
own
axis
having
been
got
rid
of
as
aforesaid
traveller
in
an
orbit
constantly
widening
so
that
while
gaining
on
mars
i
gained
on
him
less
than
did
the
earth
and
was
falling
behind
her
had
i
used
the
apergy
only
to
drive
me
directly
outward
from
the
sun
i
should
move
under
the
impulse
derived
from
the
earth
about
miles
a
day
or
millions
of
miles
in
days
in
the
direction
common
to
the
two
planets
the
effect
of
the
constantly
widening
orbit
would
be
much
as
if
the
whole
motion
took
place
on
one
midway
between
those
of
the
earth
and
mars
say
millions
of
miles
from
the
sun
the
arc
described
on
this
orbit
would
be
equivalent
to
millions
of
miles
on
that
of
mars
the
entire
arc
of
his
orbit
between
the
point
opposite
to
that
occupied
by
the
earth
when
i
started
and
the
point
of
opposition
the
entire
distance
i
had
to
gain
as
measured
along
his
path
was
about
millions
of
miles
so
that
trusting
to
the
terrestrial
impulse
alone
i
should
be
some
millions
behindhand
at
the
critical
moment
the
apergic
force
must
make
up
for
this
loss
of
ground
while
driving
me
in
a
direction
so
to
speak
at
right
angles
with
that
of
the
orbit
or
along
its
radius
straight
outward
from
the
sun
forty
odd
millions
of
miles
in
the
same
time
if
i
succeeded
in
this
i
should
reach
the
orbit
of
mars
at
the
point
and
at
the
moment
of
opposition
and
should
attain
mars
himself
but
in
this
i
might
fail
and
i
should
then
find
myself
under
the
sole
influence
of
the
sun
attraction
able
indeed
to
resist
it
able
gradually
to
steer
in
any
direction
away
from
it
but
hardly
able
to
overtake
a
planet
that
should
lie
far
out
of
my
line
of
advance
or
retreat
while
moving
at
full
speed
away
from
me
in
order
to
secure
a
chance
of
retreat
it
was
desirable
as
long
as
possible
to
keep
the
earth
between
the
astronaut
and
the
sun
while
steering
for
that
point
in
space
where
mars
would
lie
at
the
moment
when
as
seen
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
he
would
be
most
nearly
opposite
the
sun
would
cross
the
meridian
at
midnight
it
was
by
these
considerations
that
the
course
i
henceforward
steered
was
determined
by
a
very
simple
calculation
based
on
the
familiar
principle
of
the
parallelogram
of
forces
i
gave
to
the
apergic
current
a
force
and
direction
equivalent
to
a
daily
motion
of
about
miles
in
the
orbital
and
rather
more
than
a
million
in
the
radial
line
i
need
hardly
observe
that
it
would
not
be
to
the
apergic
current
alone
but
to
a
combination
of
that
current
with
the
orbital
impulse
received
at
first
from
the
earth
that
my
progress
and
course
would
be
due
the
latter
was
the
stronger
influence
the
former
only
was
under
my
control
but
it
would
suffice
to
determine
as
i
might
from
time
to
time
desire
the
resultant
of
the
combination
the
only
obvious
risk
of
failure
lay
in
the
chance
that
my
calculations
failing
or
being
upset
i
might
reach
the
desired
point
too
soon
or
too
late
in
either
case
i
should
be
dangerously
far
from
mars
beyond
his
orbit
or
within
it
at
the
time
when
i
should
come
into
a
line
with
him
and
the
sun
or
again
putting
the
same
mischance
in
another
form
behind
him
or
before
him
when
i
attained
his
orbit
but
i
trusted
to
daily
observation
of
his
position
and
verification
of
my
dead
reckoning
thereby
to
find
out
any
such
danger
in
time
to
avert
it
the
displacement
of
the
earth
on
the
sun
face
proved
it
to
be
necessary
that
the
apergic
current
should
be
directed
against
the
latter
in
order
to
govern
my
course
as
i
desired
and
to
recover
the
ground
i
had
lost
in
respect
to
the
orbital
motion
i
hoped
for
a
moment
that
this
change
in
the
action
of
the
force
would
settle
a
problem
we
had
never
been
able
to
determine
our
experiments
proved
that
apergy
acts
in
a
straight
line
when
once
collected
in
and
directed
along
a
conductor
and
does
not
radiate
like
other
forces
from
a
centre
in
all
directions
it
is
of
course
this
radiation
diffusing
the
effect
of
light
heat
or
gravity
over
the
surface
of
a
sphere
which
surface
is
proportionate
to
the
square
of
the
radius
that
causes
these
forces
to
operate
with
an
energy
inversely
proportionate
not
to
the
distance
but
to
its
square
we
had
no
reason
to
think
that
apergy
exempt
as
it
is
from
this
law
would
be
at
all
diminished
by
distance
and
this
view
the
rate
of
acceleration
as
i
rose
from
the
earth
had
confirmed
and
my
entire
experience
has
satisfied
me
that
it
is
correct
none
of
our
experiments
however
had
indicated
or
could
well
indicate
at
what
rate
this
force
can
travel
through
space
nor
had
i
yet
obtained
any
light
upon
this
point
from
the
very
first
the
current
had
been
continuous
the
only
interruption
taking
place
when
i
was
not
five
hundred
miles
from
the
surface
over
so
small
a
distance
as
that
the
force
would
move
so
instantaneously
that
no
trace
of
the
interruption
would
be
perceptible
in
the
motion
of
the
astronaut
even
now
the
total
interruption
of
the
action
of
apergy
for
a
considerable
time
would
not
affect
the
rate
at
which
i
was
already
moving
it
was
possible
however
that
if
the
current
had
been
hitherto
wholly
intercepted
by
the
earth
it
might
take
so
long
a
time
in
reaching
the
sun
that
the
interval
between
the
movement
of
the
helm
and
the
response
of
the
astronaut
course
thereto
might
afford
some
indication
of
the
time
occupied
by
the
current
in
traversing
the
millions
of
miles
which
parted
me
from
the
sun
my
hope
however
was
wholly
disappointed
i
could
neither
be
sure
that
the
action
was
instantaneous
nor
that
it
was
otherwise
at
the
close
of
the
third
day
i
had
gained
as
was
indicated
by
the
instruments
something
more
than
two
millions
of
miles
in
a
direct
line
from
the
sun
and
for
the
future
i
might
and
did
reckon
on
a
steady
progress
of
about
one
and
a
quarter
million
miles
daily
under
the
apergic
force
alone
a
gain
in
a
line
directly
outward
from
the
sun
of
about
one
million
henceforward
i
shall
not
record
my
observations
except
where
they
implied
an
unexpected
or
altered
result
on
the
sixth
day
i
perceived
another
nebula
and
on
this
occasion
in
a
more
promising
direction
it
appeared
from
its
gradual
movement
to
lie
almost
exactly
in
my
course
so
that
if
it
were
what
i
suspected
and
were
not
at
any
great
distance
from
me
i
must
pass
either
near
or
through
it
and
it
would
surely
explain
what
had
perplexed
and
baffled
me
in
the
case
of
the
former
nebula
at
this
distance
the
nature
of
the
cloudlet
was
imperceptible
to
the
naked
eye
the
window
telescope
was
not
adjustable
to
an
object
which
i
could
not
bring
conveniently
within
the
field
of
view
of
the
lenses
in
a
few
hours
the
nebula
so
changed
its
form
and
position
that
being
immediately
over
the
portion
of
the
roof
between
the
front
or
bow
lens
and
that
in
the
centre
of
the
roof
its
central
section
was
invisible
but
the
extremities
of
that
part
which
i
had
seen
in
the
first
instance
through
the
upper
plane
window
of
the
bow
were
now
clearly
visible
from
the
upper
windows
of
either
side
what
had
at
first
been
a
mere
greatly
elongated
oval
with
a
species
of
rapidly
diminishing
tail
at
each
extremity
had
now
become
an
arc
spanning
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
space
above
me
narrowing
rapidly
as
it
extended
downwards
and
sternwards
presently
it
came
in
view
through
the
upper
lens
but
did
not
obscure
in
the
least
the
image
of
the
stars
which
were
then
visible
in
the
metacompass
i
very
soon
ascertained
that
the
cloudlet
consisted
as
i
had
supposed
in
the
former
case
of
a
multitude
of
points
of
light
less
brilliant
than
the
stars
the
distance
between
which
became
constantly
wider
but
which
for
some
time
were
separately
so
small
as
to
present
no
disc
that
any
magnifying
power
at
my
command
could
render
measurable
in
the
meantime
the
extremities
visible
through
the
other
windows
were
constantly
widening
out
till
lost
in
the
spangled
darkness
by
and
by
it
became
impossible
with
the
naked
eye
to
distinguish
the
individual
points
from
the
smaller
stars
and
shortly
after
this
the
nearest
began
to
present
discs
of
appreciable
size
but
somewhat
irregular
shape
i
had
now
no
doubt
that
i
was
about
to
pass
through
one
of
those
meteoric
rings
which
our
most
advanced
astronomers
believe
to
exist
in
immense
numbers
throughout
space
and
to
the
earth
contact
with
or
approach
to
which
they
ascribe
the
showers
of
falling
stars
visible
in
august
and
november
ere
long
one
after
another
of
these
bodies
passed
rapidly
before
my
sight
at
distances
varying
probably
from
five
yards
to
five
thousand
miles
where
to
test
the
distance
was
impossible
anything
like
accurate
measurement
was
equally
out
of
the
question
but
my
opinion
is
that
the
diameters
of
the
nearest
ranged
from
ten
inches
to
two
hundred
feet
one
only
passed
so
near
that
its
absolute
size
could
be
judged
by
the
marks
upon
its
face
this
was
a
mass
presenting
at
many
places
on
the
surface
distinct
traces
of
metallic
veins
or
blotches
rudely
ovoid
in
form
but
with
a
number
of
broken
surfaces
one
or
two
of
which
reflected
the
light
much
more
brilliantly
than
others
the
weight
of
this
one
meteoroid
was
too
insignificant
as
compared
with
that
of
the
astronaut
seriously
to
disturb
my
course
fortunately
for
me
i
passed
so
nearly
through
the
centre
of
the
aggregation
that
its
attraction
as
a
whole
was
nearly
inoperative
so
far
as
i
could
judge
the
meteors
in
that
part
of
the
ring
through
which
i
passed
were
pretty
evenly
distributed
and
as
from
the
appearance
of
the
first
which
passed
my
window
to
the
disappearance
of
the
last
four
hours
elapsed
i
conceived
that
the
diameter
of
the
congeries
measured
in
the
direction
of
my
path
which
seemed
to
be
nearly
in
the
diameter
of
their
orbit
was
about
miles
and
probably
the
perpendicular
depth
was
about
the
same
i
may
mention
here
though
somewhat
out
of
place
to
avoid
interrupting
the
narrative
of
my
descent
upon
mars
the
only
interesting
incident
that
occurred
during
the
latter
days
of
my
journey
the
gradual
passage
of
the
earth
off
the
face
of
the
sun
for
some
little
time
after
this
the
earth
was
entirely
invisible
but
later
looking
through
the
telescope
adjusted
to
the
lens
on
that
side
i
discerned
two
very
minute
and
bright
crescents
which
from
their
direction
and
position
were
certainly
those
of
the
earth
and
moon
indeed
could
hardly
be
anything
else
towards
the
thirtieth
day
of
my
voyage
i
was
disturbed
by
the
conflicting
indications
obtained
from
different
instruments
and
separate
observations
the
general
result
came
to
this
that
the
discometer
where
it
should
have
indicated
a
distance
of
actually
gave
but
if
my
speed
had
increased
or
i
had
overestimated
the
loss
by
changes
of
direction
mars
should
have
been
larger
in
equal
proportion
this
however
was
not
the
case
supposing
my
reckoning
to
be
right
and
i
had
no
reason
to
think
it
otherwise
except
the
indication
of
the
discometer
the
sun
disc
ought
to
have
diminished
in
the
proportion
of
to
whereas
the
diminution
was
in
the
proportion
of
to
so
far
as
the
barycrite
could
be
trusted
its
very
minute
indications
confirmed
those
of
the
discometer
and
the
only
conclusion
i
could
draw
after
much
thought
and
many
intricate
calculations
was
that
the
distance
of
millions
of
miles
between
the
earth
and
the
sun
accepted
though
not
very
confidently
by
all
terrestrial
astronomers
is
an
and
that
consequently
all
the
other
distances
of
the
solar
system
have
been
equally
overrated
mars
consequently
would
be
smaller
but
also
his
distance
considerably
less
than
i
had
supposed
i
finally
concluded
that
the
solar
distance
of
the
earth
was
less
than
millions
of
miles
instead
of
more
than
this
would
involve
of
course
a
proportionate
diminution
in
the
distance
i
had
to
traverse
while
it
did
not
imply
an
equal
error
in
the
reckoning
of
my
speed
which
had
at
first
been
calculated
from
the
earth
disc
and
not
from
that
of
the
sun
hence
continuing
my
course
unchanged
i
should
arrive
at
the
orbit
of
mars
some
days
earlier
than
intended
and
at
a
point
behind
that
occupied
by
the
planet
and
yet
farther
behind
the
one
i
aimed
at
prolonged
observation
and
careful
calculation
had
so
fully
satisfied
me
of
the
necessity
of
the
corrections
in
question
that
i
did
not
hesitate
to
alter
my
course
accordingly
and
to
prepare
for
a
descent
on
the
instead
of
the
day
i
had
of
course
to
prepare
for
the
descent
very
long
before
i
should
come
within
the
direct
influence
of
the
attraction
of
mars
this
would
not
prevail
over
the
sun
attraction
till
i
had
come
within
a
little
more
than
miles
of
the
surface
and
this
distance
would
not
allow
for
material
reduction
of
my
speed
even
were
i
at
once
to
direct
the
whole
force
of
the
apergic
current
against
the
planet
i
estimated
that
arriving
within
some
two
millions
of
miles
of
him
with
a
speed
of
miles
per
hour
and
then
directing
the
whole
force
of
the
current
in
his
direction
i
should
arrive
at
his
surface
at
a
speed
nearly
equal
to
that
at
which
i
had
ascended
from
the
earth
i
knew
that
i
could
spare
force
enough
to
make
up
for
any
miscalculation
possible
or
at
least
probable
of
course
any
serious
error
might
be
fatal
i
was
exposed
to
two
dangers
perhaps
to
three
but
to
none
which
i
had
not
fully
estimated
before
even
preparing
for
my
voyage
if
i
should
fail
to
come
near
enough
to
the
goal
of
my
journey
and
yet
should
go
on
into
space
or
if
on
the
other
hand
i
should
stop
short
the
astronaut
might
become
an
independent
planet
pursuing
an
orbit
nearly
parallel
to
that
of
the
earth
in
which
case
i
should
perish
of
starvation
it
was
conceivable
that
i
might
in
attempting
to
avert
this
fate
fall
upon
the
sun
though
this
seemed
exceedingly
improbable
requiring
a
combination
of
accidents
very
unlikely
to
occur
on
the
other
hand
i
might
by
possibility
attain
my
point
and
yet
failing
properly
to
calculate
the
rate
of
descent
be
dashed
to
pieces
upon
the
surface
of
mars
of
this
however
i
had
very
little
fear
the
tremendous
power
of
the
apergy
having
been
so
fully
proved
that
i
believed
that
nothing
but
some
disabling
accident
to
myself
such
as
was
hardly
to
be
feared
in
the
absence
of
gravitation
and
with
the
extreme
simplicity
of
the
machinery
i
employed
could
prevent
my
being
able
when
i
became
aware
of
the
danger
to
employ
in
time
a
sufficient
force
to
avert
it
the
first
of
these
perils
then
was
the
graver
one
perhaps
the
only
grave
one
and
certainly
to
my
imagination
it
was
much
the
most
terrible
the
idea
of
perishing
of
want
in
the
infinite
solitude
of
space
and
being
whirled
round
for
ever
the
dead
denizen
of
a
planet
one
hundred
feet
in
diameter
had
in
it
something
even
more
awful
than
grotesque
on
the
morning
of
my
voyage
so
far
as
i
could
calculate
by
the
respective
direction
and
size
of
the
sun
and
of
mars
i
was
within
about
miles
from
the
latter
i
proceeded
without
hesitation
to
direct
the
whole
force
of
the
current
permitted
to
emerge
from
the
apergion
directly
against
the
centre
of
the
planet
his
diameter
increased
with
great
rapidity
till
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
i
found
myself
within
one
million
of
miles
of
his
surface
his
diameter
subtended
about
and
his
disc
appeared
about
the
size
of
the
moon
examined
through
the
telescope
it
presented
a
very
different
appearance
from
that
either
of
the
earth
or
of
her
satellite
it
resembled
the
former
in
having
unmistakably
air
and
water
but
unlike
the
earth
the
greater
portion
of
its
surface
seemed
to
be
land
and
instead
of
continents
surrounded
by
water
it
presented
a
number
of
separate
seas
nearly
all
of
them
around
the
of
each
pole
was
a
belt
of
water
around
this
again
a
broader
belt
of
continuous
land
and
outside
this
forming
the
northern
and
southern
boundary
between
the
arctic
and
temperate
zones
was
another
broader
band
of
water
connected
apparently
in
one
or
two
places
with
the
central
or
if
one
may
so
call
it
equatorial
sea
south
of
the
latter
is
the
one
great
martial
ocean
the
most
striking
feature
of
this
new
world
as
seen
from
this
point
was
the
existence
of
three
enormous
gulfs
from
three
to
five
thousand
miles
in
length
and
apparently
varying
in
breadth
from
one
hundred
to
seven
hundred
miles
in
the
midst
of
the
principal
ocean
but
somewhat
to
the
southward
is
an
island
of
unique
appearance
it
is
roughly
circular
and
as
i
perceived
in
descending
stands
very
high
its
summit
being
some
feet
as
i
subsequently
ascertained
above
the
its
surface
however
was
perfectly
white
scarcely
less
brilliant
consequently
than
an
equal
area
of
the
polar
icefields
the
globe
of
course
revolved
in
some
hours
of
earthly
time
and
as
i
descended
presented
successively
every
part
of
its
surface
to
my
view
i
speak
of
descent
but
of
course
i
was
as
yet
ascending
just
as
truly
as
ever
the
sun
being
visible
through
the
lens
in
the
floor
and
reflected
upon
the
mirror
of
the
discometer
while
mars
was
now
seen
through
the
upper
lens
and
his
image
received
in
the
mirror
of
the
metacompass
a
noteworthy
feature
in
the
meteorology
of
the
planet
became
apparent
during
the
second
day
of
the
descent
as
magnified
by
the
telescope
adjusted
to
the
upper
lens
the
distinctions
of
sea
and
land
disappeared
from
the
eastern
and
western
limbs
of
the
planet
indeed
within
or
an
hour
of
time
from
either
it
was
plain
therefore
that
those
regions
in
which
it
was
late
evening
or
early
morning
were
hidden
from
view
and
independently
of
the
whitish
light
reflected
from
them
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
obscuration
was
due
to
clouds
or
mists
had
the
whitish
light
covered
the
land
alone
it
might
have
been
attributed
to
a
snowfall
or
perhaps
even
to
a
very
severe
hoar
frost
congealing
a
dense
moisture
but
this
last
seemed
highly
improbable
and
that
mist
or
cloud
was
the
true
explanation
became
more
and
more
apparent
as
with
a
nearer
approach
it
became
possible
to
discern
dimly
a
broad
expanse
of
water
contrasting
the
orange
tinge
of
the
land
through
this
annular
veil
at
on
the
second
day
of
the
descent
i
was
about
miles
from
mars
the
micrometer
verifying
by
the
increased
angle
subtended
by
the
diameter
my
calculated
rate
of
approach
on
the
next
day
i
was
able
to
sleep
in
security
and
to
devote
my
attention
to
the
observation
of
the
planet
surface
for
at
its
close
i
should
be
still
miles
from
mars
and
consequently
beyond
the
distance
at
which
his
attraction
would
predominate
over
that
of
the
sun
to
my
great
surprise
in
the
course
of
this
day
i
discerned
two
small
discs
one
on
each
side
of
the
planet
moving
at
a
rate
which
rendered
measurement
impossible
but
evidently
very
much
smaller
than
any
satellite
with
which
astronomers
are
acquainted
and
so
small
that
their
by
terrestrial
telescopes
was
not
extraordinary
they
were
evidently
very
minute
whether
ten
twenty
or
fifty
miles
in
diameter
i
could
not
say
neither
of
them
being
likely
so
far
as
i
could
calculate
to
come
at
any
part
of
my
descent
very
near
the
astronaut
and
the
rapidity
of
their
movement
carrying
them
across
the
field
even
with
the
lowest
power
of
my
telescopes
too
fast
for
measurement
that
they
were
martial
moons
however
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
on
the
last
day
of
the
descent
the
effect
of
attraction
which
had
for
some
time
so
disturbed
the
position
of
the
astronaut
as
to
take
his
disc
completely
out
of
the
field
of
the
became
decidedly
predominant
over
that
of
the
sun
i
had
to
change
the
direction
of
the
apergic
current
first
to
the
conductor
and
afterwards
as
the
greater
weight
of
the
floor
turned
the
astronaut
completely
over
bringing
the
planet
immediately
below
it
to
the
downward
one
i
was
of
course
approaching
mars
on
the
daylight
side
and
nearly
in
the
centre
this
however
did
not
exactly
suit
me
during
the
whole
of
this
day
it
was
impossible
that
i
should
sleep
for
a
minute
since
if
at
any
point
i
should
find
that
i
had
miscalculated
my
rate
of
descent
or
if
any
other
unforeseen
accident
should
occur
immediate
action
would
be
necessary
to
prevent
a
shipwreck
which
must
without
doubt
be
fatal
it
was
very
likely
that
i
should
be
equally
unable
to
sleep
during
the
first
hours
of
my
sojourn
upon
mars
more
especially
should
he
be
inhabited
and
should
my
descent
be
observed
it
was
therefore
my
policy
to
land
at
some
point
where
the
sun
was
setting
and
to
enjoy
rest
during
such
part
of
the
twelve
hours
of
the
martial
night
as
should
not
be
employed
in
setting
my
vessel
in
order
and
preparing
to
evacuate
it
i
should
have
to
ascertain
exactly
the
pressure
of
the
martial
atmosphere
so
as
not
to
step
too
suddenly
from
a
dense
into
what
was
probably
a
very
light
one
if
possible
i
intended
to
land
upon
the
summit
of
a
mountain
so
high
as
to
be
untenanted
and
of
difficult
access
at
the
same
time
it
would
not
do
to
choose
the
highest
point
of
a
very
lofty
range
since
both
the
cold
and
the
thinness
of
the
air
might
in
such
a
place
be
fatal
i
wished
of
course
to
leave
the
astronaut
secure
and
if
not
out
of
reach
yet
not
within
easy
reach
otherwise
it
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
to
watch
my
opportunity
and
descend
in
the
dark
from
my
first
by
the
same
means
by
which
i
had
made
the
rest
of
my
voyage
at
i
was
within
miles
of
the
surface
and
could
observe
mars
distinctly
as
a
world
and
no
longer
as
a
star
the
colour
so
remarkable
a
feature
in
his
celestial
appearance
was
almost
equally
perceptible
at
this
moderate
elevation
the
seas
are
not
so
much
blue
as
grey
masses
of
land
reflected
a
light
between
yellow
and
orange
indicating
as
i
thought
that
orange
must
be
as
much
the
predominant
colour
of
vegetation
as
green
upon
earth
as
i
came
still
lower
and
only
parts
of
the
disc
were
visible
at
once
and
these
through
the
side
and
end
windows
this
conviction
was
more
and
more
strongly
impressed
upon
my
mind
what
however
was
beyond
denial
was
that
if
the
polar
ice
and
snow
were
not
so
purely
and
distinctly
white
as
they
appear
at
a
distance
upon
earth
they
were
yet
to
a
great
extent
devoid
of
the
yellow
tinge
that
preponderated
everywhere
else
the
most
that
could
be
said
was
that
whereas
on
earth
the
snow
is
of
that
white
which
we
consider
absolute
and
call
as
such
but
which
really
has
in
it
a
very
slight
preponderance
of
blue
upon
mars
the
polar
caps
are
rather
or
of
that
white
so
common
in
our
flowers
which
has
in
it
an
equally
slight
tinge
of
yellow
on
the
shore
or
about
twenty
miles
from
the
shore
of
the
principal
sea
to
the
southward
of
the
equator
and
but
a
few
degrees
from
the
equator
itself
i
perceived
at
last
a
point
which
appeared
peculiarly
suitable
for
my
descent
a
very
long
range
of
mountains
apparently
having
an
average
height
of
about
feet
with
some
peaks
of
probably
twice
or
three
times
that
altitude
stretched
for
several
hundred
miles
along
the
coast
leaving
however
between
it
and
the
actual
an
alluvial
plain
of
some
twenty
to
fifty
miles
across
at
the
extremity
of
this
range
and
quite
detached
from
it
stood
an
isolated
mountain
of
peculiar
form
which
as
i
examined
it
through
the
telescope
appeared
to
present
a
surface
sufficiently
broken
and
sloped
to
permit
of
descent
while
at
the
same
time
its
height
and
the
character
of
its
summit
satisfied
me
that
no
one
was
likely
to
inhabit
it
and
that
though
i
might
in
a
few
hours
to
ascend
it
on
foot
from
the
plain
would
be
a
day
journey
towards
this
i
directed
my
course
looking
out
from
time
to
time
carefully
for
any
symptoms
of
human
habitation
or
animal
life
i
made
out
by
degrees
the
lines
of
rivers
mountain
slopes
covered
by
great
forests
extensive
valleys
and
plains
seemingly
carpeted
by
a
low
dense
rich
vegetation
but
my
view
being
essentially
of
a
character
it
was
only
in
those
parts
that
lay
upon
my
horizon
that
i
could
discern
clearly
the
height
of
any
object
above
the
general
level
and
as
yet
therefore
there
might
well
be
houses
and
buildings
cultivated
fields
and
divisions
which
i
could
not
see
before
i
had
satisfied
myself
whether
the
planet
was
or
was
not
inhabited
i
found
myself
in
a
position
from
which
its
general
surface
was
veiled
by
the
evening
mist
and
directly
over
the
mountain
in
question
within
some
twelve
miles
of
its
summit
this
distance
i
descended
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
landed
without
a
shock
about
half
an
hour
so
far
as
i
could
judge
after
the
sun
had
disappeared
below
the
horizon
the
sunset
however
by
reason
of
the
mists
was
totally
invisible
chapter
iv
a
new
world
i
will
not
attempt
to
express
the
intensity
of
the
mingled
emotions
which
overcame
me
as
i
realised
the
complete
success
of
the
most
stupendous
adventure
ever
proposed
or
even
dreamed
by
man
i
think
that
any
personal
vanity
unworthy
of
the
highest
lessons
i
had
received
had
much
share
in
my
passionate
exultation
the
conception
was
not
original
the
means
were
furnished
by
others
the
execution
depended
less
on
a
daring
and
skill
in
which
any
courageous
traveller
or
man
of
science
knowing
what
i
knew
might
well
have
excelled
me
than
on
the
direct
and
manifest
favour
of
providence
but
this
enterprise
the
greatest
that
man
had
ever
attempted
had
in
itself
a
charm
a
sanctity
in
my
eyes
that
made
its
accomplishment
an
unspeakable
satisfaction
i
would
have
laid
down
life
a
dozen
times
not
only
to
achieve
it
myself
but
even
to
know
that
it
had
been
achieved
by
others
all
that
columbus
can
have
felt
when
he
first
set
foot
on
a
new
hemisphere
i
felt
in
tenfold
force
as
i
assured
myself
that
not
as
often
before
in
dreams
but
in
very
truth
and
fact
i
had
traversed
forty
million
miles
of
space
and
landed
in
a
new
world
of
the
perils
that
might
await
me
i
could
hardly
care
to
think
they
might
be
greater
in
degree
they
could
hardly
be
other
in
kind
than
those
which
a
traveller
might
incur
in
papua
or
central
africa
or
in
the
passage
they
could
have
none
of
that
wholly
novel
strange
incalculable
character
which
sometimes
had
given
to
the
chances
of
my
etherial
voyage
a
vague
horror
and
mystery
that
appalled
imagination
for
the
first
time
during
my
journey
i
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
yet
i
must
do
both
i
might
soon
meet
with
difficulties
and
dangers
that
would
demand
all
the
resources
of
perfect
physical
and
mental
condition
with
heavy
calls
on
the
utmost
powers
of
nerve
and
muscle
i
forced
myself
therefore
to
sup
and
to
slumber
resorting
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
to
the
stimulus
of
brandy
for
the
one
purpose
and
to
the
aid
of
authypnotism
for
the
other
when
i
woke
it
was
by
my
chronometer
and
as
i
inferred
about
after
midnight
of
the
martial
meridian
on
which
i
lay
sleep
had
given
me
an
appetite
for
breakfast
and
necessary
practical
employment
calmed
the
excitement
natural
to
my
situation
my
first
care
after
making
ready
to
quit
the
astronaut
as
soon
as
the
light
around
should
render
it
safe
to
venture
into
scenes
so
much
more
utterly
strange
unfamiliar
and
unknown
than
the
wildest
of
the
yet
unexplored
deserts
of
the
earth
was
to
ascertain
the
character
of
the
atmosphere
which
i
was
presently
to
breathe
did
it
contain
the
oxygen
essential
to
tellurian
lungs
was
it
if
capable
of
respiration
dense
enough
to
sustain
life
like
mine
i
extracted
the
plug
from
the
tubular
aperture
through
which
i
had
pumped
in
the
extra
quantity
of
air
that
the
astronaut
contained
and
substituted
the
sliding
valve
i
had
arranged
for
the
purpose
with
a
small
hole
which
by
adjustment
to
the
tube
would
give
the
means
of
regulating
the
at
pleasure
the
difficulty
of
this
simple
work
and
the
tremendous
outward
pressure
of
the
air
showed
that
the
external
atmosphere
was
very
thin
indeed
this
i
had
anticipated
gravity
on
the
surface
of
mars
is
less
than
half
what
it
is
on
earth
the
total
mass
of
the
planet
is
as
two
to
fifteen
it
was
consequently
to
be
expected
that
the
extent
of
the
martial
atmosphere
and
its
density
even
at
the
would
be
far
less
than
on
the
heavier
planet
rigging
the
securely
round
the
aperture
exhausting
its
chamber
and
permitting
the
martial
air
to
fill
it
i
was
glad
to
find
a
pressure
equal
to
that
which
prevails
at
a
height
of
feet
on
earth
chemical
tests
showed
the
presence
of
oxygen
in
somewhat
greater
proportion
than
in
the
purest
air
of
terrestrial
mountains
it
would
sustain
life
therefore
and
without
serious
injury
if
the
change
from
a
dense
to
a
light
atmosphere
were
not
too
suddenly
made
i
determined
then
gradually
to
diminish
the
density
of
the
internal
atmosphere
to
something
not
very
much
greater
than
that
outside
for
this
purpose
i
unrigged
the
apparatus
and
almost
but
not
quite
closed
the
valve
leaving
an
aperture
about
the
twentieth
part
of
an
inch
in
diameter
the
silence
was
instantly
broken
by
a
whistle
the
shrillest
and
loudest
i
had
ever
heard
the
dense
compressed
atmosphere
of
the
astronaut
rushing
out
with
a
force
which
actually
created
a
draught
through
the
whole
vessel
to
the
great
discomfiture
of
the
birds
which
roughed
their
feathers
and
fluttered
about
in
dismay
the
pressure
gauge
fell
with
astonishing
rapidity
despite
the
minuteness
of
the
aperture
and
in
a
few
minutes
indicated
about
barometrical
inches
i
then
checked
the
exit
of
the
air
for
a
time
while
i
proceeded
to
loosen
the
cement
around
the
window
by
which
i
had
entered
and
prepared
for
my
exit
over
a
very
light
flannel
i
put
on
a
of
fine
wire
which
had
turned
the
edge
of
mahratta
tulwars
repelled
the
thrust
of
a
calabrian
stiletto
and
showed
no
mark
of
three
carbine
bullets
fired
over
this
i
wore
a
suit
of
grey
broadcloth
and
a
pair
of
strong
boots
over
woollen
socks
prepared
for
cold
and
damp
as
well
as
for
the
heat
of
a
sun
shining
perpendicularly
through
an
alpine
atmosphere
i
had
nearly
equalised
the
atmospheric
pressure
within
and
without
at
about
inches
before
the
first
beams
of
dawn
shone
upward
on
the
ceiling
of
the
astronaut
a
few
minutes
later
i
stepped
forth
on
the
platform
some
two
hundred
yards
in
circumference
whereon
the
vessel
rested
the
mist
immediately
around
me
was
fast
dispersing
five
hundred
feet
below
it
still
concealed
everything
on
three
sides
descent
was
barred
by
sheer
precipices
on
the
fourth
a
steep
slope
promised
a
practicable
path
at
least
as
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
i
placed
the
weaker
and
smaller
of
my
birds
in
portable
cages
and
then
commenced
my
experiment
by
taking
out
a
cuckoo
and
throwing
him
downwards
over
the
precipice
he
fell
at
first
almost
like
a
stone
but
before
he
was
quite
lost
to
sight
in
the
mist
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
that
he
had
spread
his
wings
and
was
able
to
sustain
himself
as
the
mist
was
gradually
dissolving
i
now
ventured
to
begin
my
descent
carrying
my
and
dismissing
the
larger
birds
several
of
which
however
persistently
clung
about
me
i
had
secured
on
my
back
an
arranged
to
fire
sixteen
balls
in
succession
without
reloading
while
in
my
belt
scabbarded
in
a
leathern
sheath
i
had
placed
a
well
and
often
tried
sword
i
found
the
way
practicable
though
not
easy
till
i
reached
a
point
about
feet
below
the
summit
where
farther
progress
in
the
same
direction
was
barred
by
an
abrupt
and
impassable
cleft
some
hundred
feet
deep
to
the
right
however
the
mountain
side
seemed
to
present
a
safe
and
sufficiently
direct
descent
the
sun
was
a
full
hour
above
the
horizon
and
the
mist
was
almost
gone
still
i
had
seen
no
signs
of
animal
life
save
at
some
distance
and
in
rapid
motion
two
or
three
swarms
of
flying
insects
not
much
resembling
any
with
which
i
was
acquainted
the
vegetation
mostly
small
was
of
a
yellowish
colour
the
flowers
generally
red
varied
by
occasional
examples
of
dull
green
and
white
the
latter
however
presenting
that
sort
of
creamy
tinge
which
i
had
remarked
in
the
snow
here
i
released
and
dismissed
my
birds
one
by
one
the
stronger
and
more
courageous
flew
away
downwards
and
soon
disappeared
the
weakest
trembling
and
shivering
evidently
suffering
from
the
thinness
of
the
atmosphere
hung
about
me
or
perched
upon
the
cages
the
scene
i
now
contemplated
was
exceedingly
novel
and
striking
the
sky
instead
of
the
brilliant
azure
of
a
similar
latitude
on
earth
presented
to
my
eye
a
vault
of
pale
green
closely
analogous
to
that
olive
tint
which
the
effect
of
contrast
often
throws
over
a
small
portion
of
clear
sky
distinguished
among
the
golden
and
clouds
of
a
sunset
in
our
temperate
zones
the
vapours
which
still
hung
around
the
and
horizon
though
dispelled
from
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
sun
were
tinged
with
crimson
and
gold
much
deeper
than
the
tints
peculiar
to
an
earthly
twilight
the
sun
himself
when
seen
by
the
naked
eye
was
as
distinctly
golden
as
our
harvest
moon
and
the
whole
landscape
terrestrial
aerial
and
celestial
appeared
as
if
bathed
in
a
golden
light
wearing
generally
that
warm
summer
aspect
peculiar
to
tellurian
landscapes
when
seen
through
glass
of
a
rich
yellow
tint
it
was
a
natural
inference
from
all
i
saw
that
there
takes
place
in
the
martial
atmosphere
an
absorption
of
the
blue
rays
which
gives
to
the
sunlight
a
predominant
tinge
of
yellow
or
orange
the
small
rocky
plateau
on
which
i
stood
like
the
whole
of
the
mountainside
i
had
descended
faced
the
extremity
of
the
range
of
which
this
mountain
was
an
outpost
and
the
valley
which
separated
them
was
not
from
my
present
position
visible
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
turn
my
back
upon
this
part
of
the
landscape
as
i
descended
farther
and
therefore
took
note
at
this
point
of
the
aspect
it
presented
the
most
prominent
object
was
a
white
peak
in
the
distant
sky
rising
to
a
height
above
my
actual
level
which
i
estimated
conjecturally
at
feet
guessing
the
distance
at
fifty
miles
the
summit
was
decidedly
more
angular
and
pointed
less
softened
in
outline
by
atmospheric
influences
than
those
of
mountains
on
earth
beyond
this
in
the
farthest
distance
appeared
two
or
three
peaks
still
higher
but
of
which
of
course
only
the
summits
were
visible
to
me
on
this
side
of
the
central
peak
an
apparently
continuous
double
ridge
extended
to
within
three
miles
of
my
station
exceedingly
irregular
in
level
the
highest
elevations
being
perhaps
the
lowest
visible
depressions
feet
above
me
there
appeared
to
be
a
line
of
perpetual
snow
though
in
many
places
above
this
line
patches
of
yellow
appeared
the
nearer
of
which
were
certainly
and
the
more
distant
must
be
inferred
to
be
covered
with
a
low
close
herbaceous
vegetation
the
lower
slopes
were
entirely
clothed
with
yellow
or
reddish
foliage
between
the
woods
and
lay
extensive
pastures
or
meadows
if
they
might
be
so
called
though
i
saw
nothing
whatever
that
at
all
resembled
the
grass
of
similar
regions
on
earth
whatever
foliage
i
saw
as
yet
i
had
not
passed
near
anything
that
could
be
called
a
tree
and
very
few
shrubs
consisted
distinctly
of
leaves
analogous
to
those
of
our
deciduous
trees
chiefly
of
three
shapes
a
sort
of
square
rounded
at
the
angles
with
short
projecting
fingers
an
oval
slightly
pointed
where
it
joined
the
stalk
and
lanceolate
or
blades
of
every
size
from
two
inches
to
four
feet
in
length
nearly
all
were
of
a
dull
yellow
or
tinge
none
were
as
fine
as
the
none
succulent
or
fleshy
nothing
resembling
the
blades
of
grass
or
the
bristles
of
the
pine
and
cedar
tribes
was
visible
my
path
now
wound
steadily
downward
at
a
slope
of
perhaps
one
in
eight
along
the
hillside
obliging
me
to
turn
my
back
to
the
mountains
while
my
view
in
front
was
cut
off
by
a
sharp
ridge
immediately
before
me
by
the
time
i
turned
this
all
my
birds
had
deserted
me
and
i
was
not
i
think
more
than
feet
from
the
valley
below
just
before
reaching
this
point
i
first
caught
sight
of
a
martial
animal
a
little
creature
not
much
bigger
than
a
rabbit
itself
of
a
sort
of
colour
bounded
from
among
some
yellow
herbage
by
my
feet
and
hopped
or
sprang
in
the
manner
of
a
kangaroo
down
the
steep
slope
on
my
left
when
i
turned
the
ridge
a
wide
and
quite
new
landscape
burst
upon
my
sight
i
was
looking
upon
an
extensive
plain
the
continuation
apparently
of
a
valley
of
which
the
mountain
range
formed
the
southern
limit
to
the
southward
this
plain
was
bounded
by
the
sea
bathed
in
the
peculiar
light
i
have
tried
to
describe
and
lying
in
what
seemed
from
this
distance
a
glassy
calm
to
eastward
and
northward
the
plain
extended
to
the
horizon
and
doubtless
far
beyond
it
while
from
the
valley
north
of
the
mountain
range
emerged
a
broad
river
winding
through
the
plain
till
it
was
lost
at
the
horizon
plain
i
have
called
it
but
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
it
was
by
any
means
level
on
the
contrary
its
surface
was
broken
by
undulations
and
here
and
there
by
hills
but
all
so
much
lower
than
the
point
on
which
i
stood
that
the
general
effect
was
that
of
an
almost
flat
surface
and
now
the
question
of
habitation
and
of
human
habitation
seemed
to
be
solved
looking
through
my
i
saw
following
the
windings
of
the
river
what
must
surely
be
a
road
serving
also
perhaps
as
an
embankment
since
it
was
raised
many
feet
above
the
level
of
the
stream
it
seemed
too
that
the
plain
was
cultivated
everywhere
appeared
extensive
patches
each
of
a
single
colour
in
every
tint
between
deep
red
and
yellowish
green
and
so
distinctly
rectangular
in
form
as
irresistibly
to
suggest
the
idea
of
artificial
if
not
human
arrangement
but
there
were
other
features
of
the
scene
that
dispelled
all
doubt
upon
this
point
immediately
to
the
and
about
twenty
miles
from
where
i
stood
a
deep
arm
of
the
sea
ran
up
into
the
land
and
upon
the
shores
of
this
lay
what
was
unquestionably
a
city
it
had
nothing
that
looked
like
fortifications
and
even
at
this
distance
i
could
discern
that
its
streets
were
of
remarkable
width
with
few
or
no
buildings
so
high
as
mosques
churches
or
palaces
in
tellurian
cities
their
colours
were
most
various
and
brilliant
as
if
reflected
from
metallic
surfaces
and
on
the
waters
of
the
bay
itself
rode
what
i
could
not
doubt
to
be
ships
or
rafts
more
immediately
beneath
me
and
scattered
at
intervals
over
the
entire
plain
clustering
more
closely
in
the
vicinity
of
the
city
were
walled
enclosures
and
in
the
centre
of
each
was
what
could
hardly
be
anything
but
a
house
though
not
apparently
more
than
twelve
or
fourteen
feet
high
and
covering
a
space
sufficient
for
an
european
or
even
american
street
or
square
upon
the
lower
slopes
of
the
hill
whereon
i
stood
were
moving
figures
which
seen
through
the
binocular
proved
to
be
animals
probably
domestic
animals
since
they
never
ranged
very
far
and
presented
none
of
those
signs
of
watchfulness
and
alarm
which
are
peculiar
to
creatures
not
protected
by
man
from
their
less
destructive
enemies
and
taught
to
lay
aside
their
dread
of
man
himself
i
had
descended
then
not
only
into
an
inhabited
world
not
only
into
a
world
of
men
who
however
they
might
differ
in
outward
form
must
resemble
in
their
wants
ideas
and
habits
in
short
in
mind
if
not
in
body
the
lords
of
my
own
planet
but
into
a
civilised
world
and
among
a
race
living
under
a
settled
order
cultivating
the
soil
and
taming
the
brutes
to
their
service
and
now
as
i
came
on
lower
ground
i
found
at
each
step
new
objects
of
curiosity
and
interest
a
tree
with
leaves
taller
than
most
timber
trees
on
earth
bore
at
the
end
of
drooping
twigs
large
fruits
fruits
with
a
rind
something
like
that
of
a
pomegranate
save
for
the
colour
and
hardness
and
about
the
size
of
a
shaddock
or
melon
one
of
these
just
within
reach
of
my
hand
i
gathered
but
found
it
impossible
to
break
the
thin
dry
rind
or
shell
without
the
aid
of
a
knife
having
pierced
this
a
stream
of
red
juice
gushed
out
which
had
a
sweet
taste
and
a
strong
flavour
not
unlike
the
juice
expressed
from
cherries
but
darker
in
colour
dissecting
the
fruit
completely
i
found
it
parted
by
a
membrane
essentially
of
the
same
nature
as
the
rind
but
much
thinner
and
rather
tough
than
hard
into
sixteen
segments
like
those
of
an
orange
divided
across
the
middle
each
of
which
enclosed
a
seed
these
seeds
were
all
joined
at
the
centre
but
easily
separated
they
were
of
a
yellow
colour
and
about
as
large
as
an
almond
kernel
some
fruits
that
being
smaller
i
concluded
to
be
less
ripe
were
of
a
after
walking
for
about
a
mile
through
a
grove
of
such
trees
always
tending
downwards
i
came
to
another
of
more
varied
character
the
most
prevalent
tree
here
was
of
lower
stature
and
with
leaves
of
great
length
and
comparatively
narrow
the
fruit
of
which
though
protected
by
a
somewhat
similar
rind
was
of
rich
golden
colour
not
so
easily
seen
among
the
yellowish
leaves
and
contained
one
solid
kernel
of
about
the
size
of
an
almond
enclosed
entirely
in
a
sort
of
spongy
material
very
palatable
to
the
taste
and
resembling
more
the
inside
of
roasted
maize
than
any
other
familiar
vegetable
as
i
emerged
entirely
from
the
grove
i
came
upon
a
ditch
about
twice
as
broad
as
deep
on
earth
i
certainly
could
not
have
leaped
it
but
since
landing
on
mars
i
had
forgotten
the
weightless
life
of
the
astronaut
and
felt
as
if
on
earth
but
enjoying
great
increase
of
strength
and
energy
and
with
these
sensations
had
come
instinctively
an
exalted
confidence
in
my
physical
powers
i
took
therefore
a
vigorous
run
and
leaping
with
all
my
strength
landed
somewhat
to
my
own
surprise
a
full
yard
on
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
having
done
so
i
found
myself
in
what
was
beyond
doubt
a
cultivated
field
producing
nothing
but
one
plant
about
a
foot
in
height
this
carpeted
the
soil
with
broad
leaves
shaped
something
like
those
of
the
laurel
and
in
colour
exactly
resembling
a
withered
laurel
leaf
but
somewhat
thicker
more
metallic
and
brighter
in
appearance
and
perfectly
free
from
the
bitter
taste
of
the
bay
tribe
at
a
little
distance
i
saw
animals
somewhat
resembling
antelopes
but
on
a
second
glance
still
more
resembling
the
fabled
unicorn
they
were
like
the
latter
at
all
events
in
the
single
particular
from
which
it
derived
its
name
they
had
one
horn
about
eight
inches
in
length
intensely
sharp
smooth
and
firm
in
texture
as
ivory
but
marbled
with
vermilion
and
cream
white
their
skins
were
dappled
with
dark
red
their
ears
were
large
and
protected
by
a
lap
which
fell
down
so
as
to
shelter
the
interior
part
of
the
organ
but
which
they
had
not
quite
lost
the
power
to
erect
at
the
approach
of
a
sound
that
startled
them
they
looked
up
at
me
at
first
without
alarm
afterwards
with
some
surprise
and
presently
bounded
away
as
if
my
appearance
at
first
familiar
had
on
a
closer
examination
presented
some
unusual
particulars
frightening
them
as
everything
unusual
frightens
even
those
domestic
animals
on
earth
best
acquainted
with
man
and
most
accustomed
to
his
caprices
i
noticed
that
all
were
female
and
their
abnormally
large
udders
suggested
that
they
were
domestic
creatures
kept
for
their
milk
not
being
able
to
see
a
path
through
the
field
i
went
straight
forward
endeavouring
to
trample
the
pasture
as
little
as
i
could
but
being
surprised
to
remark
how
very
little
the
plants
had
been
injured
by
the
feet
of
the
animals
the
leaves
had
been
grazed
but
the
stems
were
seldom
or
never
broken
in
fact
the
animals
seemed
to
have
gathered
their
food
as
man
would
do
with
an
intelligent
or
instinctive
care
not
to
injure
the
plant
so
as
to
deprive
it
of
the
power
of
reproducing
their
sustenance
in
another
minute
i
discerned
the
object
of
my
paramount
interest
of
whose
vicinity
i
had
thus
far
seen
nearly
every
imaginable
evidence
except
himself
it
was
undoubtedly
a
man
but
a
man
very
much
smaller
than
myself
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
ground
as
if
in
reverie
and
he
did
not
perceive
me
till
i
had
come
within
fifty
yards
of
him
so
that
i
had
full
time
to
remark
the
peculiarities
of
his
form
and
appearance
he
was
about
four
feet
eight
or
nine
inches
in
height
with
legs
that
seemed
short
in
proportion
to
the
length
and
girth
of
the
body
but
only
because
as
was
apparent
on
more
careful
scrutiny
the
chest
was
proportionately
both
longer
and
wider
than
in
our
race
otherwise
he
greatly
resembled
the
fairer
families
of
the
aryan
breed
the
swede
or
german
the
yellow
hair
unshaven
beard
whiskers
and
moustache
were
all
close
and
short
the
dress
consisted
of
a
sort
of
blouse
and
short
pantaloons
of
some
soft
woven
fabric
and
of
a
vermilion
colour
the
head
was
protected
from
the
rays
of
an
equatorial
sun
by
a
species
of
light
turban
from
which
hung
down
a
short
shade
or
veil
sheltering
the
neck
and
forehead
his
bare
feet
were
guarded
by
sandals
of
some
flexible
material
just
covering
the
toes
and
bound
round
the
ankle
by
a
single
thong
he
carried
no
weapon
not
even
a
staff
and
i
therefore
felt
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
from
him
on
seeing
me
he
started
as
with
intense
surprise
and
not
a
little
alarm
and
turned
to
run
size
and
length
of
limb
however
gave
me
immense
advantage
in
this
respect
and
in
less
than
a
minute
i
had
come
up
with
and
laid
my
hand
upon
him
he
looked
up
at
me
scanning
my
face
with
earnest
curiosity
i
took
from
my
pocket
first
a
jewel
of
very
exquisite
construction
a
butterfly
of
turquoise
pearl
and
rubies
set
on
an
emerald
branch
upon
which
he
looked
without
admiration
or
interest
then
a
watch
very
small
and
elaborately
enamelled
and
jewelled
to
the
ornament
he
paid
no
attention
whatever
but
when
i
opened
the
watch
its
construction
and
movement
evidently
interested
him
placing
it
in
his
hands
and
endeavouring
to
signify
to
him
by
signs
that
he
was
to
retain
it
i
then
held
his
arm
and
motioned
to
him
to
guide
me
towards
the
houses
visible
in
the
distance
this
he
seemed
willing
to
do
but
before
we
had
gone
many
paces
he
repeated
two
or
three
times
a
phrase
or
word
which
sounded
like
do
you
want
i
shook
my
head
but
that
he
might
not
suppose
me
dumb
i
answered
him
in
latin
the
sound
seemed
to
astonish
him
exceedingly
and
as
i
went
on
to
repeat
several
questions
in
the
same
tongue
for
the
purpose
of
showing
him
that
i
could
speak
and
was
desirous
of
doing
so
i
observed
that
his
wonder
grew
deeper
and
deeper
and
was
evidently
mingled
first
with
alarm
and
afterwards
with
anger
as
if
he
thought
i
was
trying
to
impose
upon
him
i
pointed
to
the
sky
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
from
which
i
had
descended
and
then
along
the
course
by
which
i
had
come
explaining
aloud
at
the
same
time
the
meaning
of
my
signs
i
thought
that
he
had
caught
the
latter
but
if
so
it
only
provoked
an
incredulous
indignation
contempt
of
a
somewhat
angry
character
being
the
principal
expression
visible
in
his
countenance
i
saw
that
it
was
of
little
use
to
attempt
further
conversation
for
the
present
and
still
holding
his
hand
and
allowing
him
to
direct
me
looked
round
again
at
the
scenes
through
which
we
were
passing
the
lower
hill
slopes
before
us
appeared
to
be
divided
into
fields
of
large
extent
perhaps
some
acres
each
separated
by
ditches
we
followed
a
path
about
two
yards
broad
raised
two
or
three
inches
above
the
level
of
the
ground
and
paved
with
some
kind
of
hard
concrete
each
ditch
was
crossed
by
a
bridge
of
planks
in
the
middle
of
which
was
a
stake
or
short
pole
round
which
we
passed
with
ease
but
which
would
obviously
baffle
a
animal
of
any
size
the
crops
were
of
great
variety
and
wonderfully
free
from
weeds
most
of
them
showed
fruit
of
one
kind
or
another
sometimes
globes
on
the
top
of
upright
stalks
sometimes
clusters
of
a
sort
of
nut
on
vines
creeping
along
the
soil
sometimes
a
number
of
pulpy
fruits
about
the
size
of
an
orange
hanging
at
the
end
of
pendulous
stalks
springing
from
the
top
of
a
stiff
stem
one
field
was
bare
its
surface
of
an
ochreish
colour
deeper
than
that
of
clay
broken
and
smoothed
as
perfectly
as
the
surface
of
the
most
carefully
tended
across
this
was
ranged
a
row
of
birds
differing
though
where
and
how
i
had
hardly
leisure
to
observe
from
the
form
of
any
earthly
fowl
about
twice
the
size
of
a
crow
and
with
beaks
apparently
at
least
as
powerful
but
very
much
longer
extending
entirely
across
the
field
they
kept
line
with
wonderful
accuracy
and
as
they
marched
across
it
slowly
and
constantly
dug
their
beaks
into
the
soil
as
if
seeking
grubs
or
worms
beneath
the
surface
they
went
on
with
their
work
perfectly
undisturbed
by
our
presence
in
the
next
field
was
a
still
odder
sight
here
grew
heads
on
erect
stems
and
engaged
in
plucking
the
ripe
purple
fruit
carefully
distinguishing
them
from
the
scarlet
unripened
heads
were
of
creatures
which
from
their
occupation
and
demeanour
i
took
at
first
to
be
human
but
which
as
we
approached
nearer
i
saw
were
only
about
half
the
size
of
my
companion
and
thickly
covered
with
hair
with
bushy
tails
which
they
kept
carefully
erect
so
as
not
to
touch
the
ground
creatures
much
resembling
monkeys
in
movement
size
and
length
and
flexibility
of
limb
but
in
other
respects
more
like
gigantic
squirrels
they
held
the
stalks
of
the
fruit
they
plucked
in
their
mouths
filling
with
them
large
bags
left
at
intervals
and
from
the
manner
in
which
they
worked
i
suspected
that
they
had
no
opposable
thumbs
that
the
whole
hand
had
to
be
used
like
the
paw
of
a
squirrel
to
grasp
an
object
i
pointed
to
these
directing
my
companion
attention
and
asking
what
are
they
ambau
he
said
but
apparently
without
the
slightest
interest
in
their
proceedings
indeed
the
regularity
and
entire
freedom
from
alarm
or
vigilance
which
characterised
their
movements
convinced
me
that
both
these
and
the
birds
we
passed
were
domesticated
creatures
whose
natural
instincts
had
been
turned
to
such
account
by
human
training
after
a
few
moments
more
we
came
in
sight
of
a
regular
road
in
a
direction
nearly
at
right
angles
to
that
which
followed
the
course
of
the
river
like
the
path
it
was
constructed
of
a
hard
polished
concrete
it
was
about
forty
paces
broad
and
in
the
centre
was
a
raised
way
about
four
inches
higher
than
the
general
surface
and
occupying
about
of
the
entire
width
along
the
main
way
on
either
side
passed
from
time
to
time
with
great
rapidity
light
vehicles
of
shining
metal
each
having
three
wheels
one
small
one
in
front
and
two
much
larger
behind
with
seat
and
steering
handle
otherwise
resembling
nothing
so
much
as
the
velocipedes
i
have
seen
ridden
for
amusement
by
eccentric
english
youths
it
was
clear
however
that
these
vehicles
were
not
moved
by
any
effort
on
the
part
of
their
drivers
and
their
speed
was
far
greater
than
that
of
the
swiftest
say
from
fifteen
to
thirty
miles
an
hour
all
risk
of
collision
was
avoided
as
those
proceeding
in
opposite
directions
took
opposite
sides
of
the
road
separated
by
the
raised
centre
i
have
described
crossing
the
road
with
caution
we
came
upon
a
number
of
small
houses
perhaps
twenty
feet
square
each
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
garden
marked
out
by
a
narrow
ditch
some
of
them
having
at
either
side
wings
of
less
height
and
thrown
a
little
backward
in
the
centre
of
each
and
at
the
end
of
the
wings
where
these
existed
was
what
seemed
to
be
a
door
of
some
translucent
material
about
twelve
feet
in
height
but
i
observed
that
these
doors
were
divided
by
a
scarcely
perceptible
line
up
to
six
feet
from
the
ground
and
presently
one
of
these
parted
and
a
figure
closely
resembling
that
of
my
guide
came
out
we
had
now
reached
another
road
which
led
apparently
towards
the
larger
houses
i
had
seen
in
the
distance
and
were
proceeding
along
the
raised
central
pathway
when
some
persons
from
the
cottages
followed
us
at
a
call
from
my
guide
these
and
presently
as
many
more
ran
after
and
gathered
around
us
i
turned
took
down
my
from
my
back
and
waving
it
around
me
signalled
to
them
to
keep
back
not
choosing
to
incur
the
danger
of
a
sudden
rush
since
their
bearing
if
not
plainly
hostile
was
not
hospitable
or
friendly
thus
escorted
but
not
actually
assailed
i
passed
on
for
three
or
four
miles
by
which
time
we
were
among
the
larger
dwellings
of
which
i
have
spoken
each
of
them
stood
in
grounds
enclosed
by
walls
about
eight
feet
high
each
of
some
uniform
colour
contrasting
agreeably
with
that
chosen
for
the
exterior
of
the
house
the
enclosures
varied
in
size
from
about
six
to
sixty
acres
the
houses
were
for
the
most
part
some
twelve
feet
in
height
and
from
one
to
four
hundred
feet
square
on
several
flat
roofs
guarded
by
low
parapets
other
persons
all
about
the
size
of
my
guide
now
showed
themselves
all
of
them
interested
and
as
it
seemed
somewhat
excited
by
my
appearance
in
a
few
cases
groups
differently
dressed
and
from
their
somewhat
smaller
stature
slighter
figures
and
the
long
hair
here
and
there
visible
probably
consisting
of
women
were
gathered
on
a
remoter
portion
of
the
roof
but
these
when
seen
by
those
in
front
were
always
waived
back
with
an
impatient
or
threatening
gesture
and
instantly
retired
presently
two
or
three
men
more
richly
dressed
than
my
escort
and
in
various
colours
came
out
upon
the
road
addressing
one
of
these
i
pointed
again
to
the
sky
and
again
endeavoured
to
describe
my
journey
holding
out
to
him
at
the
same
time
as
the
thing
most
likely
to
conciliate
him
a
watch
somewhat
larger
than
that
i
had
bestowed
upon
my
guide
he
however
did
not
come
within
arm
length
and
when
i
repeated
my
signs
he
threw
back
his
head
with
a
sort
of
sneer
and
uttered
a
few
words
in
a
sharp
tone
at
which
my
escort
rushed
upon
and
attempted
to
throw
me
down
for
this
however
i
had
been
long
prepared
and
striking
right
and
left
with
my
for
i
was
determined
not
to
shed
blood
except
in
the
last
extremity
i
speedily
cleared
a
circle
round
me
still
grasping
my
guide
with
the
left
hand
from
a
providential
instinct
which
suggested
that
his
close
contiguity
might
in
some
way
protect
me
a
call
from
the
chief
of
my
antagonists
was
answered
from
the
roof
of
a
neighbouring
house
i
heard
a
whizzing
through
the
air
and
presently
something
like
a
winged
serpent
but
with
a
slender
neck
and
shoulders
of
considerable
breadth
and
a
head
much
larger
than
a
serpent
in
proportion
to
the
body
and
shaped
more
like
a
bird
with
a
sharp
short
beak
sprang
upon
and
coiled
round
my
left
arm
that
it
was
trying
to
sting
with
an
erectile
organ
placed
about
midway
between
the
shoulders
and
the
tail
i
became
instinctively
aware
and
presently
felt
something
like
a
weak
electric
thrill
over
all
my
body
while
my
left
hand
which
was
naked
sustained
a
severe
shock
completely
numbing
it
for
the
moment
i
caught
the
beast
by
the
neck
and
flung
him
with
all
my
force
right
in
the
face
of
my
chief
antagonist
who
fell
with
a
cry
of
terror
looking
in
the
direction
from
which
this
dangerous
assailant
had
come
i
perceived
another
in
the
air
and
saw
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
dropping
my
gun
with
the
muzzle
between
my
feet
and
holding
it
so
far
as
i
could
with
my
numbed
left
hand
releasing
also
my
guide
but
throwing
him
to
the
ground
as
i
released
him
i
drew
my
sword
and
but
just
in
time
with
the
same
motion
with
which
i
drew
it
i
cut
right
through
the
neck
of
the
dragon
that
had
been
launched
against
me
my
principal
enemy
had
quickly
recovered
his
feet
and
presence
of
mind
and
spoke
very
loudly
and
at
some
length
to
the
person
who
had
launched
the
dragons
the
latter
disappeared
and
at
the
same
time
the
group
around
me
began
to
disperse
whatever
suited
them
was
certain
not
to
suit
me
and
accordingly
still
holding
my
sword
i
caught
one
of
them
with
each
hand
it
was
well
i
had
done
so
for
within
another
minute
the
owner
of
the
dragons
reappeared
with
a
weapon
not
wholly
unlike
a
long
cannon
of
very
small
bore
fixed
upon
a
sort
of
stand
this
he
levelled
at
me
and
i
seeing
that
a
danger
of
whose
magnitude
and
nature
i
could
form
no
exact
estimate
was
impending
caught
up
instinctively
one
of
my
prisoners
and
held
him
as
a
shield
between
myself
and
the
weapon
pointed
at
me
this
checked
my
enemy
who
for
the
moment
seemed
almost
as
much
at
a
loss
as
myself
fortunately
his
hostile
intention
evidently
endangered
not
only
my
life
but
all
near
me
and
secured
me
from
any
close
attack
at
this
moment
a
somewhat
remarkable
personage
came
to
the
front
of
the
group
which
had
gathered
some
few
yards
before
me
he
wore
a
long
frock
of
emerald
green
and
trousers
of
the
same
colour
gathered
in
at
the
waist
by
a
belt
of
a
red
metal
on
earth
i
should
have
taken
him
for
a
hale
and
vigorous
gentleman
of
some
fifty
years
he
was
two
inches
short
of
five
feet
but
well
proportioned
as
a
man
of
middle
size
gentleman
i
say
emphatically
for
something
of
dignity
gravity
and
calm
was
conspicuous
in
his
manner
as
authority
unmixed
with
menace
was
evident
in
his
tone
he
called
somewhat
peremptorily
as
i
thought
to
the
man
who
was
still
aiming
his
weapon
at
my
head
then
waived
back
those
behind
him
and
presently
advanced
towards
me
looking
me
straight
in
the
eyes
with
a
steadiness
and
intensity
of
gaze
far
exceeding
both
in
expressiveness
and
in
effect
the
most
fixed
stare
of
the
most
successful
mesmerists
i
have
known
i
doubt
whether
i
should
have
had
the
power
to
resist
his
will
had
i
thought
it
wise
to
do
so
but
i
was
perfectly
aware
that
however
successful
in
repelling
the
first
tumultuous
attack
prolonged
was
hopeless
i
must
probably
at
the
next
move
certainly
in
a
few
minutes
succumb
to
the
enemies
around
me
i
could
not
conciliate
those
whose
malignity
i
could
not
comprehend
i
had
done
them
no
injury
and
they
could
hardly
be
maddened
by
fear
since
my
size
and
strength
did
not
seem
to
overawe
them
save
at
close
quarters
and
of
my
weapons
they
were
certainly
less
afraid
than
i
of
theirs
my
only
chance
must
lie
in
finding
favour
with
an
individual
protector
when
therefore
the
fearlessly
laid
his
hand
on
an
arm
which
could
have
killed
him
at
a
blow
and
rather
by
gesture
than
by
force
released
my
captives
policy
as
well
as
instinct
dictated
submission
i
allowed
him
to
disarm
and
make
me
in
some
sense
his
prisoner
without
a
show
of
resistance
he
took
me
by
the
left
hand
first
placing
my
fingers
upon
his
own
wrist
and
then
grasping
mine
and
led
me
quietly
through
the
crowd
which
gave
way
before
him
reluctantly
and
not
without
angry
murmurs
but
with
a
certain
awe
as
before
one
superior
either
in
power
or
rank
thus
he
led
me
for
about
half
a
mile
till
we
reached
the
crystal
gate
of
an
enclosure
of
exceptional
size
the
walls
of
which
like
the
gate
itself
were
of
a
pale
through
grounds
laid
out
in
symmetrical
alternation
of
orchard
and
grove
shrubbery
field
and
garden
beds
arranged
with
evident
regard
to
effect
in
form
and
colour
as
well
as
to
fitting
distribution
of
shade
and
sun
we
followed
a
straight
path
which
sloped
under
a
canopy
of
flowering
creepers
up
to
the
terrace
on
which
stood
the
house
itself
there
were
some
eight
or
nine
crystal
doors
or
windows
in
the
front
and
in
the
centre
one
somewhat
larger
than
the
others
which
as
we
came
immediately
in
front
of
it
opened
not
turning
on
hinges
but
like
every
other
door
i
had
seen
dividing
and
sliding
rapidly
into
the
walls
to
the
right
and
left
we
entered
and
it
immediately
closed
behind
us
in
the
same
way
turning
my
head
for
a
moment
i
was
surprised
to
observe
that
whereas
i
could
see
nothing
through
the
door
from
the
outside
the
scene
without
was
as
visible
from
within
as
through
the
most
perfectly
transparent
glass
the
chamber
in
which
i
found
myself
had
walls
of
bright
emerald
green
with
all
the
brilliant
transparency
of
the
jewel
their
surface
broken
by
of
minutely
perfect
execution
and
divided
into
panels
each
of
which
seemed
to
contain
a
series
of
distinct
scenes
one
above
the
other
by
living
creepers
with
foliage
of
bright
gold
and
flowers
sometimes
pink
sometimes
of
great
size
both
double
and
single
the
former
mostly
hemispherical
and
the
latter
commonly
shaped
as
hollow
cones
or
avide
shallow
champagne
glasses
in
these
walls
two
or
three
doors
appeared
reaching
from
the
floor
to
the
roof
which
was
coloured
like
the
walls
and
seemingly
of
the
same
material
through
one
of
these
my
guide
led
me
into
a
passage
which
appeared
to
run
parallel
with
the
front
of
the
house
and
turning
down
this
a
door
again
parted
on
the
right
hand
through
which
he
led
me
into
a
similar
but
smaller
apartment
some
twenty
feet
in
width
and
in
length
the
window
if
i
should
so
call
that
which
was
simply
another
door
of
this
apartment
looked
into
one
corner
of
a
of
great
extent
beyond
and
at
each
end
of
which
were
other
portions
of
the
dwelling
the
walls
of
this
chamber
were
pink
the
surface
appearing
as
before
of
lustre
the
roof
and
floor
of
a
green
lighter
than
that
of
the
emerald
in
two
corners
were
piles
of
innumerable
cushions
and
pillows
covered
with
a
most
delicate
fabric
embroidered
with
gold
silver
and
feathers
all
soft
as
and
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
there
were
three
or
four
light
tables
apparently
of
metal
silver
or
azure
or
golden
in
colour
in
various
parts
of
the
chamber
with
one
or
two
of
different
form
more
like
small
or
desks
in
one
of
the
walls
was
sunk
a
series
of
shelves
closed
by
a
transparent
sheet
of
crystal
of
pale
yellow
tinge
there
were
three
or
four
movable
seats
resembling
writing
or
but
also
of
metal
luxurious
all
though
all
different
in
the
corner
to
the
left
farthest
from
the
inner
court
or
peristyle
was
a
screen
which
as
my
host
showed
me
concealed
a
bath
and
some
other
convenient
appurtenances
the
bath
was
a
cylinder
some
five
feet
in
depth
and
about
two
in
diameter
with
thin
double
walls
the
space
between
which
was
filled
with
an
apparatus
of
small
pipes
by
pressing
a
spring
as
my
protector
pointed
out
countless
minute
jets
of
warm
perfumed
water
were
thrown
from
every
part
of
the
interior
wall
forming
the
most
delicious
and
perfect
that
could
well
be
devised
my
host
then
led
me
to
a
seat
among
the
cushions
and
placed
himself
beside
me
looking
for
some
time
intently
and
gravely
into
my
face
but
with
nothing
of
offensive
curiosity
still
less
of
menace
in
his
gaze
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
he
wished
to
read
the
character
and
perhaps
the
thoughts
of
his
guest
the
scrutiny
seemed
to
satisfy
him
he
stretched
out
his
left
hand
and
grasping
mine
placed
it
on
his
heart
and
then
dropping
my
hand
placed
his
upon
my
breast
he
then
spoke
in
words
whose
meaning
i
could
not
guess
but
the
tone
sounded
to
me
as
that
of
inquiry
the
question
most
likely
to
be
asked
concerned
my
character
and
the
place
from
which
i
had
come
i
again
explained
again
pointing
upward
he
seemed
dubious
or
perplexed
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
drawing
might
assist
explanation
since
from
the
and
tracery
it
was
evident
that
the
art
was
carried
to
no
common
excellence
in
mars
i
drew
therefore
in
the
first
place
a
globe
to
represent
the
earth
traced
its
orbit
round
the
sun
and
placed
a
crescent
moon
at
some
little
distance
indicating
its
path
round
the
earth
it
was
evident
that
my
host
understood
my
meaning
the
more
clearly
when
i
marked
upon
the
form
of
the
earth
a
crescent
such
as
she
would
often
present
through
a
martial
telescope
sketches
in
outline
roughly
exhibiting
different
stages
of
my
voyage
from
the
first
ascent
to
the
final
landing
appeared
to
convince
my
host
of
my
meaning
if
not
of
my
veracity
signing
to
me
to
remain
where
i
was
he
left
the
room
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
accompanied
by
one
of
the
strange
animals
i
had
seen
in
the
fields
i
was
right
in
conjecturing
that
the
creature
had
no
opposable
thumb
but
a
little
ingenuity
had
compensated
this
so
far
as
regarded
the
power
of
carrying
a
little
chain
hung
down
from
each
wrist
and
to
these
was
suspended
a
tray
upon
which
were
arranged
a
variety
of
fruits
and
what
seemed
to
be
small
loaves
of
various
materials
breaking
one
of
these
and
cutting
open
with
a
small
knife
apparently
of
silver
one
of
the
fruits
my
host
tasted
each
and
then
motioned
to
me
to
eat
the
attendant
had
placed
the
tray
upon
a
table
disengaged
the
chains
and
disappeared
the
door
opening
and
closing
as
he
trod
somewhat
more
heavily
than
had
been
necessary
for
my
host
upon
particular
points
of
the
floor
the
food
offered
me
was
very
delicious
and
various
in
flavour
my
host
showed
me
how
to
cut
the
top
from
some
of
the
fruits
so
as
to
have
a
cup
full
of
the
most
juice
the
whole
pulp
having
been
reduced
to
a
liquid
syrup
by
a
process
with
which
some
semicivilised
cultivators
on
earth
are
familiar
when
i
had
finished
my
meal
my
host
whistled
and
the
attendant
returning
carried
away
the
tray
his
master
gave
him
at
the
same
time
what
was
evidently
an
order
repeating
it
twice
and
speaking
with
signal
clearness
of
intonation
the
little
creature
bowed
its
head
apparently
as
a
sign
of
intelligence
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
with
what
seemed
like
a
pencil
or
stylus
and
writing
materials
and
with
a
large
box
of
very
curious
form
to
one
side
was
affixed
a
sort
of
mouthpiece
consisting
of
a
truncated
cone
expanding
into
a
bowl
across
the
wider
and
outer
end
of
the
cone
was
stretched
a
membrane
or
diaphragm
about
three
inches
in
diameter
into
the
mouth
of
the
bowl
two
or
three
inches
from
the
diaphragm
my
host
spoke
one
by
one
a
series
of
articulate
but
single
sounds
beginning
with
a
aa
au
o
oo
ou
u
y
or
ei
long
i
short
oi
e
which
i
afterwards
found
to
be
the
twelve
vowels
of
their
language
after
he
had
thus
uttered
some
forty
distinct
sounds
he
drew
from
the
back
of
the
instrument
a
slip
of
something
like
goldleaf
on
which
as
many
weird
curves
and
angular
figures
were
traced
in
crimson
pointing
to
these
in
succession
he
repeated
the
sounds
in
order
i
made
out
that
the
figures
in
question
represented
the
sounds
spoken
into
the
instrument
and
taking
out
my
pencil
marked
under
each
the
equivalent
character
of
the
roman
alphabet
supplemented
by
some
letters
not
admitted
therein
but
borrowed
from
other
aryan
tongues
my
host
looked
on
with
some
interest
whilst
i
did
this
and
bent
his
head
as
if
in
approval
here
then
was
the
alphabet
of
the
martial
tongue
an
alphabet
not
arbitrary
but
actually
produced
by
the
vocal
sounds
it
represented
the
elaborate
machinery
modifies
the
rough
signs
which
are
traced
by
the
mere
aerial
vibrations
but
each
character
is
a
true
physical
type
a
visual
image
of
the
spoken
sound
the
voice
temper
accent
sex
of
a
speaker
affect
the
phonograph
and
are
recognisable
in
the
record
the
instrument
wrote
so
to
speak
different
hands
under
my
voice
and
under
esmo
and
those
who
knew
him
could
identify
his
phonogram
as
my
friends
my
manuscript
after
i
had
been
employed
for
some
time
in
fixing
these
forms
and
the
corresponding
sounds
in
my
memory
my
host
advanced
to
the
window
and
opening
it
led
me
into
the
interior
garden
which
as
i
had
supposed
was
a
species
of
central
court
around
which
the
house
was
built
the
construction
of
the
house
was
at
once
apparent
it
consisted
of
a
front
portion
divided
by
the
gallery
of
which
i
have
spoken
all
the
rooms
on
one
side
thereof
looking
like
the
chamber
i
first
entered
into
the
outer
enclosure
those
on
the
other
into
the
interior
garden
or
peristyle
beyond
the
latter
was
a
single
row
of
chambers
opening
upon
it
appropriated
to
the
ladies
and
children
of
the
household
the
court
was
roofed
over
with
the
translucent
material
of
the
windows
it
was
about
feet
in
length
by
in
width
at
either
end
were
chambers
entirely
formed
of
the
same
material
as
the
roof
in
one
of
which
the
various
birds
and
animals
employed
either
in
domestic
service
or
in
agriculture
in
another
the
various
stores
of
the
household
were
kept
in
front
of
these
two
inclined
planes
of
the
same
material
as
the
walls
of
the
house
led
up
to
the
several
parts
of
the
roof
the
court
was
divided
by
broad
concrete
paths
into
four
gardens
in
the
centre
of
each
was
a
basin
of
water
and
a
fountain
above
which
was
a
square
opening
of
some
twenty
feet
in
the
roof
each
garden
was
so
to
speak
turfed
with
minute
plants
smaller
than
daisy
roots
and
even
more
closely
covering
the
soil
than
english
lawn
grass
these
were
of
different
colours
emerald
gold
and
purple
arranged
in
bands
this
turf
was
broken
by
a
number
of
beds
of
all
shapes
the
crescent
circle
and
star
being
apparently
the
chief
favourites
the
smaller
of
these
were
severally
filled
with
one
or
two
flowers
in
the
larger
flowers
of
different
colours
were
set
in
patterns
generally
rising
from
the
outside
to
the
centre
and
never
allowing
the
soil
to
be
seen
through
a
single
interval
the
contrast
of
colours
and
tints
was
admirably
ordered
the
size
form
and
structure
of
the
flowers
wonderfully
various
and
always
exquisitely
beautiful
the
exact
tints
of
silver
and
gold
were
frequent
and
especially
favoured
at
each
corner
of
every
garden
was
a
hollow
silvery
pillar
up
which
creepers
with
flowers
of
marvellous
size
and
beauty
and
foliage
of
hues
almost
as
striking
as
those
of
the
flowers
were
conducted
to
form
a
perfect
arch
overhead
parting
off
the
gardens
from
the
walks
in
each
basin
were
fishes
whose
brilliancy
of
colouring
and
beauty
of
form
far
surpassed
anything
i
have
seen
in
earthly
seas
or
rivers
at
the
meeting
of
the
four
cross
paths
was
a
wide
space
covered
with
a
soft
woven
carpet
upon
which
were
strown
cushions
similar
to
those
in
my
room
on
these
several
ladies
were
reclining
who
rose
as
the
head
of
the
family
approached
one
who
seemed
by
her
manner
to
be
the
mistress
and
by
her
resemblance
to
some
of
her
younger
companions
the
mother
of
the
family
wore
a
sort
of
light
golden
on
the
head
and
over
this
falling
round
her
to
the
waist
a
crimson
veil
intended
apparently
to
protect
her
head
and
neck
from
the
sun
as
much
as
to
conceal
them
her
face
was
partially
uncovered
the
dress
of
all
was
except
in
colour
and
in
certain
omissions
and
additions
much
the
same
the
must
have
been
slight
in
material
and
few
in
number
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
them
save
the
sleeves
which
were
of
a
delicate
substance
resembling
that
of
the
finest
parisian
kid
gloves
but
far
softer
and
finer
over
all
was
a
robe
almost
without
shape
save
what
it
took
from
the
figure
to
which
it
closely
adapted
itself
suspended
by
broad
ribbons
and
jewelled
clasps
from
the
shoulders
falling
nearly
to
the
ankles
and
gathered
in
by
a
zone
at
the
waist
this
garment
left
the
neck
shoulders
and
the
upper
part
of
the
bosom
uncovered
but
the
veil
whether
covering
the
head
completely
drawn
round
all
save
the
face
or
consisting
only
of
two
separate
muslin
falls
behind
either
ear
was
always
so
arranged
as
to
render
the
general
effect
far
more
decorous
than
the
low
dresses
of
european
matrons
and
maidens
the
ankles
and
feet
were
entirely
bare
save
for
sandals
with
an
embroidered
velvety
covering
for
the
toes
and
silver
bands
clasped
round
the
ankles
the
eldest
lady
wore
a
pale
green
robe
of
a
fine
but
very
light
fabric
three
younger
ones
wore
a
similar
material
of
pink
with
silver
and
veils
hiding
everything
but
the
eyes
all
these
had
sleeves
reaching
to
the
wrist
ending
in
gloves
of
the
same
fabric
two
young
girls
were
robed
in
white
gauze
with
gauze
veils
attached
over
either
ear
to
a
very
slight
silver
coronal
their
arms
bare
till
the
sleeve
of
the
appeared
a
couple
of
inches
below
the
shoulder
their
bright
soft
faces
and
their
long
hair
which
fell
freely
down
the
back
kept
in
graceful
order

and
there
by
almost
invisible
silver
clasps
or
bands
were
totally
uncovered
a
maiden

the
martialist

make
the
most
of
her
charms
a

her
lord
exclusive
right
one
of
the
girls
my
host
daughters
might
almost
have
veiled
her
entire
form
above
the
knees
in
the
masses
of
rich
soft
brown
hair
inherited
from
her
father

mingled
with
tresses
of
another
tinge
shimmering
like
gold
under
certain
lights
her
eyes
of
deepest
violet
were
shaded
by
dark
thick
lashes
so
long
that
when
the
lids
were
closed
they
traced
a
clear
black
curve
on
either
cheek
the
other
maiden
had
like
their
mother
and
i
believe
like
the
younger
matrons
the
bright
hair
flaxen
in
early
childhood
pale
gold
in
maturer
years
and
the
blue
or
grey
eyes
characteristic
of
the
race
my
host
spoke
two
or
three
words
to
the
chief
of
the
party
indicating
me
by
a
graceful
and
courteous
wave
of
the
hand
upon
which
the
person
addressed
slightly
bent
her
head
laying
her
hand
at
the
same
time
upon
her
heart
the
others
acknowledged
the
introduction
by
a
similar
but
slighter
inclination
and
all
resumed
their
places
as
soon
as
my
host
seating
himself
between
us
signed
to
me
to
occupy
some
pillows
which
one
of
the
young
ladies
arranged
on
his
left
hand
i
had
observed
by
this
time
that
the
left
hand
was
used
by
preference
as
we
use
the
right
for
all
purposes
and
therefore
was
naturally
extended
in
courtesy
and
the
left
side
was
for
similar
reasons
the
place
of
honour
three
or
four
children
were
playing
in
another
part
of
the
court
all
with
one
exception
were
remarkably
beautiful
and
certainly
not
less
graceful
in
form
and
movement
than
the
happiest
and
prettiest
in
our
own
world
their
tones
were
soft
and
gentle
and
their
bearing
towards
each
other
notably
kind
and
considerate
one
unfortunate
little
creature
differed
from
the
rest
in
all
respects
it
was
slightly
lame
misshapen
rather
than
awkward
and
with
a
face
that
indicated
bad
health
bad
temper
or
both
its
manner
was
peevish
and
fractious
its
tones
sharp
and
harsh
and
its
actions
rough
and
hasty
i
took
it
for
a
mother
sickly
favourite
deformed
in
character
to
compensate
for
physical
deformity
watching
them
for
a
short
time
i
saw
the
little
creature
repeatedly
break
out
in
all
the
humours
of
an
in
an
family
snatching
toys
from
the
others
and
now
and
then
slapping
or
pinching
them
but
they
never
returned
either
word
or
blow
even
when
pain
or
vexation
brought
the
tears
to
their
eyes
when
its
caprices
became
intolerable
most
of
its
companions
withdrew
one
however
always
remaining
on
the
watch
even
if
driven
from
the
immediate
neighbourhood
by
its
intolerably
provoking
temper
tones
and
acts
before
sunset
we
were
joined
by
a
young
man
who
first
approaching
my
host
with
a
respectful
inclination
of
the
head
stood
before
him
till
apparently
desired
by
a
few
quiet
words
to
speak
when
he
addressed
the
head
of
the
family
in
some
short
sentences
and
then
at
a
sign
from
him
turned
to
two
of
the
animals
ambau
which
followed
him
these
then
laid
at
my
feet
two
large
baskets
or
open
bags
of
golden
network
containing
many
of
the
smaller
objects
left
in
the
astronaut
emptying
these
they
brought
several
more
till
they
had
laid
before
me
the
whole
of
my
wardrobe
and
my
store
of
intended
presents
books
and
drawings
with
such
of
my
instruments
as
were
not
attached
to
the
walls
it
was
evident
that
great
care
had
been
taken
not
to
injure
or
dismantle
the
vessel
nothing
that
actually
belonged
to
it
had
been
taken
away
and
of
the
articles
brought
not
one
had
been
broken
or
damaged
it
was
equally
evident
that
there
was
no
intention
or
idea
of
appropriating
them
they
were
brought
and
handed
over
to
me
as
a
host
on
earth
might
send
for
the
baggage
of
an
unexpected
guest
of
the
various
toys
and
ornaments
that
i
had
brought
for
the
purpose
i
offered
several
of
the
most
precious
to
my
host
he
accepted
one
of
the
smallest
and
least
valuable
rather
declining
to
understand
than
refusing
the
offer
of
the
rest
the
bringer
did
the
same
then
placing
in
the
chief
hands
an
open
containing
a
variety
of
the
choicest
jewellery
i
requested
by
signs
his
permission
to
offer
them
to
the
ladies
the
elder
ones
imitated
his
example
and
graciously
accepted
one
or
two
tasteful
feminine
ornaments
of
far
less
beauty
and
value
than
any
of
the
few
splendid
jewels
that
adorned
their
belts
and
clasped
their
robes
at
the
shoulder
or
fastened
their
veils
the
maidens
shrank
back
shyly
until
the
box
was
pressed
upon
them
when
each
at
a
word
from
the
mistress
selected
some
small
gold
or
silver
locket
or
chain
each
at
once
placing
the
article
accepted
about
her
person
with
an
evident
intention
of
adding
to
the
grace
with
which
it
was
received
and
acknowledging
the
intended
courtesy
how
valueless
the
most
valuable
of
these
trifles
must
have
been
in
their
eyes
i
had
begun
to
suspect
from
what
i
saw
and
was
afterwards
made
fully
aware
as
the
shades
of
evening
fell
the
fountains
ceased
to
play
the
young
man
pressed
electric
springs
which
closed
the
openings
in
the
roof
and
finally
turning
a
small
handle
caused
a
bright
light
to
diffuse
itself
over
the
whole
garden
and
through
the
doors
into
the
chambers
opening
upon
it
at
the
same
time
a
warmer
air
gradually
spread
throughout
the
interior
of
the
building
a
meal
was
then
served
in
small
low
trays
which
was
eaten
by
all
of
us
reclining
on
our
cushions
after
which
the
ladies
retired
and
my
host
conducted
me
back
to
my
chamber
and
left
me
to
repose
my
books
and
sketches
as
well
as
the
portfolios
of
popular
prints
which
i
had
selected
to
assist
me
in
describing
the
life
and
scenery
of
our
world
were
with
my
wardrobe
and
other
properties
arranged
on
my
shelves
by
the
under
the
direction
of
kevimâ
the
young
gentleman
who
had
superintended
their
removal
and
conveyance
to
his
father
house
the
portfolios
gave
me
occasional
means
and
topics
of
pleasant
intercourse
with
the
family
of
my
host
before
we
could
converse
at
ease
in
their
language
the
children
though
never
troublesome
or
importunate
took
frequent
opportunities
of
stealing
into
the
room
to
look
over
the
prints
i
produced
for
their
amusement
the
ladies
also
particularly
the
maiden
who
seemed
to
be
the
especial
guardian
of
the
little
ones
would
draw
near
to
look
and
listen
the
latter
though
she
never
entered
the
room
or
directly
addressed
me
often
assisted
in
explaining
my
broken
sentences
to
her
charges
some
of
them
not
many
years
younger
than
herself
i
took
sincere
pleasure
in
the
children
company
and
growing
confidence
but
they
were
not
the
less
welcome
because
they
drew
their
sisters
to
listen
to
my
descriptions
of
an
existence
so
strange
and
so
remote
in
habits
and
character
as
well
as
in
space
perhaps
their
gentle
governess
learned
more
than
any
other
member
of
the
family
respecting
and
my
own
adventures
by
land
and
water
in
air
and
space
for
though
just
not
child
enough
to
share
the
children
freedom
she
took
in
all
they
heard
she
listened
in
silence
during
our
evening
gatherings
to
the
conversation
in
which
her
father
and
brother
encouraged
me
to
practise
the
language
i
was
laboriously
studying
she
had
therefore
double
opportunities
of
acquiring
a
knowledge
which
seemed
to
interest
her
deeply
naturally
since
it
was
so
absolutely
novel
and
communicated
by
one
whose
very
presence
was
the
most
marvellous
of
the
marvels
it
attested
how
much
she
understood
i
could
not
judge
except
her
mother
the
ladies
did
not
take
a
direct
part
in
my
talk
with
the
children
and
but
very
seldom
interposed
through
my
host
a
shy
brief
question
when
the
evening
brought
us
all
together
the
maidens
despite
their
theoretical
privileges
were
even
more
reserved
than
their
elders
and
the
eveena
the
most
silent
and
shy
of
all
i
learned
afterwards
that
the
privilege
of
intercourse
with
the
ladies
of
the
household
restricted
as
it
was
was
wholly
exceptional
and
even
in
this
family
was
conceded
only
out
of
consideration
for
one
who
could
not
safely
be
allowed
to
leave
the
house
chapter
v
language
laws
and
life
though
treated
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
courtesy
i
soon
found
reason
to
understand
that
i
was
at
least
for
the
present
a
prisoner
my
host
or
his
son
never
failed
to
invite
me
each
day
to
spend
some
time
in
the
outer
enclosure
but
never
intentionally
left
me
alone
there
on
one
occasion
when
kevimâ
had
been
called
away
and
i
ventured
to
walk
down
towards
the
gate
my
host
youngest
child
who
had
been
playing
on
the
roof
ran
after
me
and
reaching
me
just
as
my
foot
was
set
on
the
spring
that
opened
the
gate
or
outer
door
caught
me
by
the
hand
and
looking
up
into
my
face
expressed
by
glance
and
gesture
a
negative
so
unmistakable
that
i
thought
it
expedient
at
once
to
comply
and
return
to
the
house
there
my
time
was
occupied
for
as
great
a
part
of
each
day
as
i
could
give
to
such
a
task
without
extreme
fatigue
in
mastering
the
language
of
the
country
this
was
a
much
simpler
task
than
might
have
been
supposed
i
soon
found
that
unlike
any
terrestrial
tongue
the
language
of
this
people
had
not
grown
but
been
made
constructed
deliberately
on
set
principles
with
a
view
to
the
greatest
possible
simplicity
and
the
least
possible
taxation
of
the
memory
there
were
no
exceptions
or
irregularities
and
few
unnecessary
distinctions
while
words
were
so
connected
and
related
that
the
mastery
of
a
few
simple
grammatical
forms
and
of
a
certain
number
of
roots
enabled
me
to
guess
at
and
by
and
by
to
feel
tolerably
sure
of
the
meaning
of
a
new
word
the
verb
has
six
tenses
formed
by
the
addition
of
a
consonant
to
the
root
and
six
persons
plural
and
singular
masculine
and
feminine
singular
masc
fem
plural
masc
fem
i
am
avâ
ava
we
are
avau
avaa
thou
art
avo
avoo
you
are
avou
avu
he
or
she
is
avy
ave
they
are
avoi
avee
the
terminations
are
the
three
pronouns
feminine
and
masculine
singular
and
plural
each
represented
by
one
of
twelve
vowel
characters
and
declined
like
nouns
when
a
nominative
immediately
follows
the
verb
the
pronominal
suffix
is
generally
dropped
unless
required
by
euphony
thus
a
man
strikes
is
but
in
the
past
tense
the
verb
without
the
suffix
being
unpronounceable
the
past
tense
is
formed
by
the
insertion
of
i
have
been
the
future
by
the
imperative
which
in
the
first
person
is
used
to
convey
determination
or
resolve
spoken
in
a
peremptory
tone
meaning
i
be
while
according
to
the
intonation
means
be
or
thou
shalt
be
shalt
whether
or
no
forms
the
conditional
and
the
conditional
past
i
should
have
been
the
need
for
a
passive
voice
is
avoided
by
the
simple
method
of
putting
the
pronoun
in
the
accusative
thus
signifies
i
strike
me
strike
i
am
struck
the
infinitive
is
being
having
been
about
to
be
these
are
declined
like
nouns
of
which
latter
there
are
six
forms
the
masculine
in
o
and
y
the
feminine
in
oo
and
e
the
plurals
being
formed
exactly
as
in
the
pronominal
suffixes
of
the
verb
the
without
inflexion
alone
is
used
where
the
name
is
employed
in
no
connection
with
a
verb
where
in
every
terrestrial
language
the
nominative
would
be
employed
thus
my
guide
had
named
the
sing
but
the
word
is
declined
as
follows
ambâs
ambaus
ambâl
ambaul
or
ambân
ambaun
or
ambâm
ambaum
the
five
other
forms
are
declined
in
the
same
manner
the
vowel
of
the
last
syllable
only
differing
adjectives
are
declined
like
nouns
but
have
no
comparative
or
superlative
degree
the
former
being
expressed
by
prefixing
the
intensitive
syllable
the
latter
when
used
which
is
but
seldom
by
the
prefix
signifying
in
an
emphatic
sense
as
his
grace
of
wellington
is
in
england
called
duke
prepositions
and
adverbs
end
in
or
each
form
of
the
noun
has
as
a
rule
its
special
relation
to
the
verb
of
the
same
root
thus
from
dâc
strike
are
derived
weapon
or
hammer
a
stroke
or
striking
as
given
both
masculine
anvil
blow
or
beating
as
received
and
a
thing
beaten
feminine
the
sixth
form
masculine
has
in
this
case
no
proper
signification
and
not
being
wanted
is
not
used
individual
letters
or
syllables
are
largely
employed
in
combination
to
give
new
and
even
contradictory
meanings
to
a
root
thus
like
the
latin
signifies
penetration
motion
towards
or
simply
remaining
in
a
place
or
again
permanence
like
the
latin
or
indicates
motion
from
expresses
uncertainty
or
incompleteness
and
is
employed
to
convert
a
statement
into
a
question
or
a
relative
pronoun
into
one
of
inquiry
like
the
greek
or
generally
signifies
opposition
or
negation
is
as
aforesaid
intensitive
and
is
employed
for
example
to
convert
to
breathe
into
to
speak
is
by
itself
an
interjection
of
abhorrence
or
disgust
in
composition
it
indicates
detestation
or
destruction
thus
signifies
hatred
the
destruction
of
life
or
to
kill
for
the
most
part
indicates
passivity
but
with
different
effect
according
to
its
place
in
the
word
thus
signifies
to
rule
to
be
ruled
to
control
one
self
to
obey
the
signification
of
roots
themselves
is
modified
by
a
modification
of
the
principal
vowel
or
consonant
by
exchanging
the
original
for
one
closely
related
thus
exist
be
in
the
positive
sense
of
being
this
or
that
live
breathe
is
a
diminutive
with
often
abbreviated
to
combination
union
thus
means
those
who
were
brought
into
life
together
or
brethren
i
may
add
before
i
quit
this
subject
that
the
martial
system
of
arithmetic
differs
from
ours
principally
in
the
use
of
a
duodecimal
instead
of
a
decimal
basis
figures
are
written
on
a
surface
divided
into
minute
squares
and
the
value
of
a
figure
whether
it
signify
so
many
units
dozens
twelve
dozens
and
so
forth
depends
upon
the
square
in
which
it
is
placed
the
central
square
of
a
line
represents
the
unit
place
and
is
marked
by
a
line
drawn
above
it
thus
a
figure
answering
to
our
i
if
placed
in
the
fourth
square
to
the
left
represents
in
the
third
place
to
the
right
counting
the
unit
square
in
both
cases
it
signifies
and
so
forth
in
less
than
a
fortnight
i
had
obtained
a
general
idea
of
the
language
and
was
able
to
read
easily
the
graven
representations
of
spoken
sound
which
i
have
described
and
by
the
end
of
a
month
to
use
a
word
which
had
no
meaning
here
i
could
speak
intelligibly
if
not
freely
only
in
a
language
so
simple
could
my
own
anxiety
to
overcome
as
soon
as
possible
a
fatal
obstacle
to
all
investigation
of
this
new
world
and
the
diligent
and
patient
assistance
given
by
my
host
or
his
son
for
a
great
part
of
every
day
have
enabled
me
to
make
such
rapid
progress
i
had
noted
even
during
the
short
evening
gatherings
when
the
whole
family
was
assembled
the
extreme
taciturnity
of
both
sexes
and
by
the
time
i
could
make
myself
understood
i
was
not
surprised
to
learn
that
the
martials
have
scarcely
the
idea
of
what
we
mean
by
conversation
not
talking
for
the
sake
of
talking
or
speaking
unless
they
have
something
to
discuss
explain
or
communicate
i
found
again
that
a
new
and
much
more
difficult
task
though
fortunately
one
not
so
indispensable
was
still
in
store
for
me
the
martials
have
two
forms
of
writing
the
one
i
have
described
which
is
simply
a
mechanical
rendering
of
spoken
words
into
artificially
simplified
visible
signs
the
other
written
by
hand
with
a
fine
pencil
of
some
chemical
material
on
a
prepared
surface
textile
or
metallic
the
characters
of
the
latter
are
like
ours
wholly
arbitrary
but
the
contractions
and
abbreviations
are
so
numerous
that
the
mastery
of
the
mere
alphabet
the
forty
or
fifty
single
letters
employed
is
but
a
single
step
in
the
first
stage
of
the
hard
task
of
learning
to
read
in
no
country
on
earth
except
china
is
this
task
half
so
severe
as
in
mars
on
the
other
hand
when
it
is
once
mastered
a
far
superior
instrument
has
been
gained
the
martial
writing
being
a
most
terse
but
perfectly
legible
shorthand
every
martial
can
write
at
least
as
quickly
as
he
can
speak
and
can
read
the
written
character
more
rapidly
than
the
quickest
eye
can
peruse
the
best
terrestrial
print
copies
whether
of
the
phonographic

stylographic

are
multiplied
with
extreme
facility
and
perfection
the
original

upon

sheet
of
a
species
of
linen
smoother

current
of
electricity

through
the
former
reproduces
the
writing
exactly
upon
the
latter
which
has
been
previously
steeped
in
some
chemical
composition
the
effect
apparently
depending
on
the
passage
of
the
electricity
through
the
untouched
metal
and
its
absolute
interception
by
the
ink
if
i
may
so
call
it
of
the
writing
which
bites
deeply
into
the
leaf
this
process
can
be
repeated
almost
and
it
is
equally
easy
to
take
at
any
time
a
fresh
copy
upon
which
serves
again
for
the
reproduction
of
any
number
of
copies
the
book
for
the
convenience
of
this
mode
of
reproduction
consists
of
a
single
sheet
generally
from
four
to
eight
inches
in
breadth
and
of
any
length
required
the
writing
intended
to
be
thus
copied
is
always
minute
and
is
read
for
the
most
part
through
magnifying
spectacles
a
roller
is
attached
to
each
end
of
the
sheet
and
when
not
in
use
the
latter
is
wound
round
that
attached
to
the
conclusion
when
required
for
reading
both
rollers
are
fixed
in
a
stand
and
slowly
moved
by
clockwork
which
spreads
before
the
eyes
of
the
reader
a
length
of
about
four
inches
at
once
the
motion
is
slackened
or
quickened
at
the
reader
pleasure
and
can
be
stopped
altogether
by
touching
a
spring
another
means
of
reproducing
not
merely
writings
or
drawings
but
natural
objects
consists
in
a
simple
adaptation
of
the
the
only
essential
difference
from
our
photographs
being
that
the
martial
art
reproduces
colour
as
well
as
outline
i
omit
this
description
while
i
was
practising
myself
in
the
martial
language
my
host
turned
our
experimental
conversations
chiefly
if
not
exclusively
upon
terrestrial
subjects
endeavouring
to
learn
all
that
i
could
convey
to
him
of
the
physical
peculiarities
of
the
earth
of
geology
geography
vegetation
animal
life
in
all
its
forms
human
existence
laws
manners
social
and
domestic
order
afterwards
when
at
the
end
of
some
fifty
days
he
found
that
we
could
converse
if
not
with
ease
yet
without
fear
of
serious
misapprehension
he
took
an
early
opportunity
of
explaining
to
me
the
causes
and
circumstances
of
my
unfriendly
reception
among
his
people
your
size
and
form
he
said
startled
and
surprised
them
i
gather
from
what
you
have
told
me
that
on
earth
there
are
many
nations
very
imperfectly
known
to
one
another
with
different
dress
language
and
manners
this
planet
is
now
inhabited
by
a
single
race
all
speaking
the
same
tongue
using
much
the
same
customs
and
differing
from
one
another
in
form
and
size
much
less
widely
than
i
understand
do
men
upon
your
earth
there
you
might
have
been
taken
for
a
visitor
from
some
strange
and
unexplored
country
here
it
was
clear
that
you
were
not
one
of
our
race
and
yet
it
was
inconceivable
what
else
you
could
be
we
have
no
giants
the
tallest
skeleton
preserved
in
our
museums
is
scarcely
a
hand
breadth
taller
than
myself
and
does
not
of
course
approach
to
your
stature
then
as
you
have
pointed
out
your
limbs
are
longer
and
your
chest
smaller
in
proportion
to
the
rest
of
the
body
probably
because
as
you
seem
to
say
your
atmosphere
is
denser
than
ours
and
we
require
ampler
lungs
to
inhale
the
quantity
of
air
necessary
at
each
breath
for
the
oxidation
of
the
blood
then
you
were
not
dumb
and
yet
affected
not
to
understand
our
language
and
to
speak
a
different
one
no
such
creature
could
have
existed
in
this
planet
without
having
been
seen
described
and
canvassed
you
did
not
therefore
belong
to
us
the
story
you
told
by
signs
was
quickly
apprehended
and
as
quickly
rejected
as
an
audacious
impossibility
it
was
an
insult
to
the
intelligence
of
your
hearers
and
a
sufficient
ground
for
suspecting
a
being
of
such
size
and
physical
strength
of
some
evil
or
dangerous
design
the
mob
who
first
attacked
you
were
probably
only
perplexed
and
irritated
those
who
subsequently
interfered
may
have
been
animated
also
by
scientific
curiosity
you
would
have
been
well
worth
anatomisation
and
chemical
analysis
your
protected
you
from
the
shock
of
the
dragon
which
was
meant
to
paralyse
and
place
you
at
the
mercy
of
your
assailants
the
metal
distributing
the
current
and
the
silken
lining
resisting
its
passage
still
at
the
moment
when
i
interposed
you
would
certainly
have
been
destroyed
but
for
your
manoeuvre
of
laying
hold
of
two
of
your
immediate
escort
our
destructive
weapons
are
far
superior
to
any
you
possess
or
have
described
that
levelled
at
you
by
my
neighbour
would
have
sent
to
ten
times
your
distance
a
small
ball
which
bursting
would
have
asphyxiated
every
living
thing
for
several
yards
around
but
our
laws
regarding
the
use
of
such
weapons
are
very
stringent
and
your
enemy
dared
not
imperil
the
lives
of
those
you
held
those
laws
would
not
he
evidently
thought
apply
to
yourself
who
as
he
would
have
affirmed
could
not
be
regarded
as
a
man
and
an
object
of
legal
protection
he
explained
the
motives
and
conduct
of
his
countrymen
with
such
perfect
coolness
such
absence
of
surprise
or
indignation
that
i
felt
slightly
nettled
and
answered
sarcastically
if
the
slaughter
of
strangers
whose
account
of
themselves
appears
improbable
be
so
completely
a
matter
of
course
among
you
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
your
own
interference
and
the
treatment
i
have
received
from
yourself
and
your
family
so
utterly
opposite
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
form
to
that
i
met
from
everybody
else
i
do
not
he
answered
always
act
from
the
motives
in
vogue
among
my
of
this
planet
but
why
and
how
i
differ
from
them
it
might
not
be
well
to
explain
it
is
for
the
moment
of
more
consequence
to
tell
you
why
you
have
been
kept
in
some
sense
a
prisoner
here
my
neighbours
independently
of
general
laws
are
for
certain
reasons
afraid
to
do
me
serious
wrong
while
in
my
company
or
in
my
dwelling
they
could
hardly
attempt
your
life
without
endangering
mine
or
those
of
my
family
if
you
were
seen
alone
outside
my
premises
another
attempt
whether
by
the
asphyxiator
or
by
a
destructive
animal
would
probably
be
made
and
might
this
time
prove
successful
till
therefore
the
question
of
your
humanity
and
right
to
the
protection
of
our
law
is
decided
by
those
to
whom
it
has
been
submitted
i
will
beg
you
not
to
venture
alone
beyond
the
bounds
that
afford
you
security
and
to
believe
that
in
this
request
as
in
detaining
you
perforce
heretofore
i
am
acting
simply
for
your
own
welfare
and
not
he
added
smiling
with
a
view
to
secure
the
first
opportunity
of
putting
your
relation
to
our
race
to
the
tests
of
the
dissecting
table
and
the
laboratory
but
my
story
explained
everything
that
seemed
inexplicable
why
was
it
not
believed
it
was
assumed
that
i
could
not
belong
to
mars
yet
i
was
a
living
creature
in
the
flesh
and
must
therefore
have
come
from
some
other
planet
as
i
could
hardly
be
supposed
to
be
an
inhabitant
of
space
we
do
reason
on
impossibilities
replied
my
friend
we
have
a
maxim
that
it
is
more
probable
that
any
number
of
witnesses
should
lie
that
the
senses
of
any
number
of
persons
should
be
deluded
than
that
a
miracle
should
be
true
and
by
a
miracle
we
mean
an
interruption
or
violation
of
the
known
laws
of
nature
one
eminent
terrestrial
sceptic
i
rejoined
has
said
the
same
thing
and
masters
of
the
science
of
probabilities
have
supported
his
assertion
but
a
miracle
should
be
a
violation
not
merely
of
the
known
but
of
all
the
laws
of
nature
and
until
you
know
all
those
laws
how
can
you
tell
what
is
a
miracle
the
lifting
of
iron
by
a
magnet
i
suppose
you
have
iron
and
loadstones
here
as
we
have
on
earth
was
to
the
first
man
who
witnessed
it
just
as
complete
a
violation
of
the
law
of
gravity
as
now
appears
my
voyage
through
space
accomplished
by
a
force
bearing
some
relation
to
that
which
acts
through
the
magnet
our
philosophers
he
answered
are
probably
satisfied
that
they
know
nearly
all
that
is
to
be
known
of
natural
laws
and
forces
and
to
delusion
or
illusion
human
sense
is
undeniably
liable
if
i
said
you
can
not
trust
your
senses
you
may
as
well
disbelieve
in
your
own
existence
and
in
everything
around
you
for
you
know
nothing
save
through
those
senses
which
are
liable
to
illusion
but
we
know
practically
that
there
are
limits
to
illusion
at
any
rate
your
maxim
leads
directly
and
practically
to
the
inference
that
since
i
do
not
belong
to
mars
and
can
not
have
come
from
any
other
world
i
am
not
here
and
in
fact
do
not
exist
surely
it
was
somewhat
illogical
to
shoot
an
illusion
and
intend
to
dissect
a
spectre
is
not
a
fact
the
complete
and
unanswerable
refutation
of
its
impossibility
a
good
many
facts
to
which
i
could
testify
he
replied
are
in
this
world
confessed
impossibilities
and
if
my
neighbours
witnessed
them
they
would
pronounce
them
to
be
either
impostures
or
illusions
then
said
i
somewhat
indignantly
they
must
prefer
inferences
from
facts
to
facts
themselves
and
the
deductions
of
logic
to
the
evidence
of
their
senses
yet
if
that
evidence
be
wanting
in
certainty
then
since
no
chain
can
be
stronger
than
its
weakest
point
inferences
are
doubly
uncertain
first
because
they
are
drawn
from
facts
reported
by
sense
and
secondly
because
a
flaw
in
the
logic
is
always
possible
do
not
repeat
that
out
of
doors
he
answered
smiling
it
is
not
permitted
here
to
doubt
the
infallibility
of
science
and
any
one
who
ventures
to
affirm
persistently
a
story
which
science
pronounces
impossible
like
your
voyage
through
space
if
he
do
not
fall
at
once
a
victim
to
popular
piety
would
be
consigned
to
the
worse
than
living
death
of
confinement
in
a
lunatic
hospital
in
that
case
i
fear
very
much
that
i
have
little
chance
of
being
put
under
the
protection
of
your
laws
since
whatever
may
be
the
impression
of
those
who
have
seen
me
every
one
else
must
inevitably
pronounce
me
and
a
nonentity
can
hardly
be
the
subject
of
legal
wrong
or
have
a
right
to
legal
redress
nor
he
replied
can
there
be
any
need
or
any
right
to
annihilate
that
which
does
not
exist
this
alternative
may
occupy
our
courts
of
justice
for
aught
i
know
longer
than
you
or
i
can
hope
to
live
what
i
have
asked
is
that
till
these
have
decided
between
two
contradictory
absurdities
you
shall
be
provisionally
and
without
prejudice
considered
as
a
human
reality
and
an
object
of
legal
protection
and
who
i
asked
has
authority
to
decide
this
point
it
was
submitted
he
answered
in
the
first
place
to
the
astyntâ
captain
president
who
governs
this
district
but
as
i
expected
he
declined
to
pronounce
upon
it
and
referred
it
to
the
mepta
governor
of
the
province
argument
so
bewildered
the
latter
that
he
sent
the
question
immediately
to
the
zamptâ
regent
of
this
dominion
and
he
after
hearing
by
telegraph
the
opening
of
the
case
at
once
pronounced
that
as
affecting
the
entire
planet
it
must
be
decided
by
the
camptâ
or
suzerain
now
this
gentleman
is
impatient
of
the
dogmatism
of
the
philosophers
who
have
tried
recently
to
impose
upon
him
one
or
two
new
theoretical
rules
which
would
limit
the
amount
of
what
he
calls
free
will
that
he
practically
enjoys
and
as
the
philosophers
are
all
against
you
and
as
moreover
he
has
a
strong
though
secret
hankering
after
curious
phenomena
it
would
not
do
to
say
after
impossibilities
i
do
not
think
he
will
allow
you
to
be
destroyed
at
least
till
he
has
seen
you
is
it
possible
i
said
that
even
your
monarch
cherishes
a
belief
in
the
incredible
or
logically
impossible
and
yet
escapes
the
lunatic
asylum
with
which
you
threaten
me
i
should
not
escape
grave
consequences
were
i
to
attribute
to
him
a
heresy
so
detestable
said
my
host
even
the
camptâ
would
not
be
rash
enough
to
let
it
be
said
that
he
doubts
the
infallibility
of
science
or
of
public
opinion
as
its
exponent
but
as
it
is
the
worst
of
offences
to
suggest
the
existence
of
that
which
is
pronounced
impossible
or
unscientific
the
supreme
authority
can
always
in
virtue
of
the
enormity
of
the
guilt
insist
on
undertaking
himself
the
executive
investigation
of
all
such
cases
and
generally
contrives
to
have
the
impossibility
if
a
tangible
one
brought
into
the
presence
either
as
evidence
or
as
accomplice
well
i
rejoined
after
a
few
minutes
reflection
i
do
know
that
i
have
much
right
to
complain
of
ideas
which
after
all
are
but
the
logical
development
of
those
which
are
finding
constantly
more
and
more
favour
among
our
most
enlightened
nations
i
can
quite
believe
from
what
i
have
seen
of
our
leading
scientists
that
in
another
century
it
may
be
dangerous
in
my
own
country
for
my
descendants
to
profess
that
belief
in
a
creator
and
a
future
life
which
i
am
superstitious
enough
to
prefer
to
all
the
revelations
of
all
the
material
sciences
as
you
value
your
life
and
freedom
he
replied
do
speak
of
such
a
belief
here
save
to
the
members
of
my
own
family
and
to
those
with
whom
i
may
tell
you
you
are
safe
such
ideas
were
held
here
almost
as
generally
as
you
say
they
now
are
on
earth
some
twelve
thousand
years
ago
and
twenty
thousand
years
ago
their
profession
was
compulsory
but
for
the
last
hundred
centuries
it
has
been
settled
that
they
are
utterly
fatal
to
the
progress
of
the
race
to
enlightenment
to
morality
and
to
the
practical
devotion
of
our
energies
to
the
business
of
life
and
they
are
not
merely
disavowed
and
denounced
but
hated
with
an
earnestness
proportioned
to
the
scientific
enthusiasm
of
classes
and
individuals
but
said
i
if
so
long
so
severely
and
so
universally
discountenanced
how
can
their
expression
by
one
man
here
or
there
be
considered
perilous
our
philosophers
say
he
replied
that
the
attractiveness
of
these
ideas
to
certain
minds
is
such
that
no
reasoning
no
demonstration
of
their
absurdity
will
prevent
their
exercising
a
mischievous
influence
upon
weak
and
especially
upon
feminine
natures
and
perhaps
the
suspicion
that
they
are
still
held
in
secret
may
contribute
to
keep
alive
the
bitterness
with
which
they
are
repudiated
and
repressed
but
if
they
are
so
held
if
there
be
any
who
believe
that
the
order
of
the
universe
was
at
first
established
and
that
its
active
forces
are
still
sustained
and
governed
by
a
conscious
intelligence
if
there
be
those
who
think
that
they
have
proof
positive
of
the
continued
existence
of
human
beings
after
death
their
secret
has
been
well
kept
for
very
many
centuries
have
elapsed
since
the
last
victim
of
such
delusions
as
they
were
solemnly
pronounced
by
public
vote
in
the
reign
of
the
predecessor
of
the
present
camptâ
was
sent
as
incurable
to
the
dangerous
ward
of
our
strictest
hospital
for
the
insane
a
tone
of
irony
and
at
the
same
time
an
air
of
guarded
reserve
seemed
to
pervade
all
my
host
remarks
on
this
subject
and
i
perceived
that
for
some
reason
it
was
so
unpleasant
to
him
that
courtesy
obliged
me
to
drop
it
i
put
therefore
to
turn
the
conversation
some
questions
as
to
the
political
organisation
of
which
his
words
had
afforded
me
a
glimpse
and
in
reply
he
undertook
to
give
me
a
summary
of
the
political
history
of
his
planet
during
the
last
few
hundred
generations
if
he
said
in
giving
you
this
sketch
of
the
process
by
which
our
present
social
order
has
been
established
i
should
mention
a
class
or
party
who
have
stood
at
certain
times
distinctly
apart
from
or
in
opposition
to
the
majority
i
must
in
the
first
place
beg
you
to
ask
no
questions
about
them
and
in
the
next
not
to
repeat
incautiously
the
little
i
may
tell
you
or
to
show
by
asking
questions
of
others
what
you
have
heard
from
me
i
gave
my
promise
frankly
of
course
and
he
then
gave
me
the
following
sketch
of
martial
history
we
date
events
from
the
union
of
all
races
and
nations
in
a
single
state
a
union
which
was
formally
established
years
ago
at
that
time
the
large
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
planet
possessed
no
other
property
than
their
houses
clothes
and
tools
their
furniture
and
a
few
other
trifles
the
land
was
owned
by
fewer
than
proprietors
those
who
possessed
movable
wealth
may
have
numbered
thrice
as
many
political
and
social
power
was
in
the
hands
of
the
owners
of
property
and
of
those
generally
connected
with
them
by
birth
or
marriage
who
were
at
any
rate
not
dependent
on
manual
labour
for
their
bread
but
among
these
there
were
divisions
and
factions
on
various
questions
more
or
less
trivial
none
of
them
approaching
in
importance
or
interest
to
the
fundamental
and
irreconcilable
conflict
sure
one
day
to
arise
between
those
who
had
accumulated
wealth
and
those
who
had
not
to
gain
their
ends
in
one
or
another
of
these
frivolous
quarrels
each
party
in
turn
admitted
to
political
influence
section
after
section
of
what
you
call
the
proletariat
till
in
the
year
universal
suffrage
was
granted
every
man
and
woman
over
the
age
of
twelve
years
being
entitled
to
a
single
and
equal
vote
about
the
same
time
the
change
in
opinion
of
which
i
have
spoken
had
taken
general
effect
and
the
vast
majority
of
the
men
at
any
rate
had
ceased
to
believe
in
a
future
life
wherein
the
inequalities
and
iniquities
of
this
might
be
redressed
it
followed
that
they
were
fiercely
impatient
of
hardships
and
suffering
especially
such
as
they
thought
might
be
redressed
by
political
and
social
changes
the
leaders
of
the
multitude
for
the
most
part
men
belonging
to
the
propertied
classes
who
had
either
wasted
their
wealth
or
never
possessed
any
demanded
the
abolition
of
private
ownership
first
of
land
then
of
movable
wealth
a
demand
which
fiercely
excited
the
passions
of
those
who
possessed
neither
and
as
bitterly
provoked
the
anger
and
alarm
of
those
who
did
the
struggle
raged
for
some
generations
and
ended
by
an
appeal
to
the
sword
in
which
since
the
force
of
the
state
was
by
law
in
the
hands
of
the
majority
the
intelligent
thrifty
careful
owners
of
property
with
their
adherents
were
signally
defeated
universal
communism
was
established
in
none
being
permitted
to
own
or
even
to
claim
the
exclusive
use
of
any
portion
of
the
planet
surface
or
of
any
other
property
except
the
share
of
food
and
clothing
allotted
to
him
one
only
privilege
was
allowed
to
certain
sectaries
who
still
clung
to
the
habits
of
the
past
to
the
permanence
and
privacy
of
family
life
they
were
permitted
to
have
houses
or
portions
of
houses
to
themselves
and
to
live
there
on
the
share
of
the
public
produce
allotted
to
the
several
members
of
each
household
it
had
been
assumed
as
matter
of
course
by
the
majority
that
when
every
one
was
forced
to
work
there
would
be
more
than
enough
for
all
that
public
spirit
and
if
necessary
coercion
would
prove
as
effectual
stimulants
to
exertion
and
industry
as
interest
and
necessity
had
done
under
the
system
of
private
ownership
those
who
relied
on
the
refutation
of
this
theory
forgot
that
with
poor
and
suffering
men
who
look
to
no
future
and
acknowledge
no
law
but
such
as
is
created
by
their
own
capricious
will
and
pleasure
envy
is
even
a
more
powerful
passion
than
greed
the
many
preferred
that
wealth
and
luxury
should
be
destroyed
rather
than
that
they
should
be
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
few
the
first
and
most
visible
effect
of
communism
was
the
utter
disappearance
of
all
perishable
luxuries
of
all
food
clothing
furniture
better
than
that
enjoyed
by
the
poorest
whatever
could
not
be
produced
in
quantities
sufficient
to
give
each
an
appreciable
share
was
not
produced
at
all
next
the
quarrels
arising
out
of
the
apportionment
of
labour
were
bitter
constant
and
savage
only
a
grinding
despotism
could
compose
them
and
those
who
wielded
such
despotism
for
a
short
time
excited
during
the
period
of
their
rule
such
fierce
and
universal
hatred
that
they
were
invariably
overturned
and
almost
invariably
murdered
before
their
very
brief
legal
term
of
office
had
closed
it
was
not
only
that
those
engaged
in
the
same
kind
of
labour
quarrelled
over
the
task
assigned
to
each
whether
allotted
in
proportion
to
his
strength
or
to
the
difficulty
of
his
labour
or
by
lot
equally
to
all
those
to
whom
the
less
agreeable
employments
were
assigned
rebelled
or
murmured
and
at
last
it
was
necessary
to
substitute
rotation
for
division
of
labour
since
no
one
would
admit
that
he
was
best
fitted
for
the
lower
or
less
agreeable
of
course
we
thus
wasted
silver
tools
in
doing
the
work
of
iron
and
reduced
enormously
the
general
production
of
wealth
next
it
was
found
that
since
one
man
industry
or
idleness
could
produce
no
appreciable
effect
upon
the
general
wealth
still
less
upon
the
particular
share
assigned
to
him
every
man
was
as
idle
as
the
envy
and
jealousy
of
his
neighbours
would
allow
finally
as
the
produce
annually
diminished
and
the
number
of
mouths
to
be
fed
became
a
serious
consideration
the
parents
of
many
children
were
regarded
as
public
enemies
the
entire
independence
of
women
as
equal
citizens
with
no
recognised
relation
to
individual
men
was
the
inevitable
outcome
logically
and
practically
of
the
communistic
principle
but
this
only
made
matters
worse
attempts
were
of
course
made
to
restrain
multiplication
by
law
but
this
brought
about
inquisitions
so
utterly
intolerable
that
human
nature
revolted
against
them
the
sectaries
i
have
mentioned
around
whom
without
adopting
or
even
understanding
their
principles
gradually
gathered
all
the
better
elements
of
society
every
man
of
intellect
and
spirit
who
had
not
been
murdered
with
a
still
larger
proportion
of
women
seceded
separately
or
in
considerable
numbers
at
once
established
themselves
in
those
parts
of
the
planet
whose
less
fertile
soil
or
less
genial
climate
had
caused
them
to
be
abandoned
and
there
organised
societies
on
the
old
principles
of
private
ownership
and
the
permanence
of
household
ties
by
and
by
as
they
visibly
prospered
they
attracted
the
envy
and
greed
of
the
communists
they
worked
under
whatever
disadvantage
could
be
inflicted
by
climate
and
soil
but
they
had
a
much
more
than
countervailing
advantage
in
mutual
attachment
in
freedom
from
the
bitter
passions
necessarily
excited
by
the
jealousy
and
incessant
mutual
interference
inseparable
from
the
communistic
system
and
in
their
escape
from
the
caprice
and
instability
of
popular
government
these
societies
whether
from
wisdom
or
mere
reaction
submitting
to
the
rule
of
one
or
a
few
chief
magistrates
selected
by
the
natural
leaders
of
each
community
moreover
they
had
not
merely
the
adhesion
of
all
the
more
able
ambitious
and
intellectual
who
seceded
from
a
republic
in
which
neither
talent
nor
industry
could
give
comfort
or
advantage
but
also
the
full
benefit
of
inventive
genius
stimulated
by
the
hope
of
wealth
in
addition
to
whatever
public
spirit
the
habits
of
communism
had
not
extinguished
they
systematically
encouraged
the
cultivation
of
science
which
the
communists
had
very
early
put
down
as
a
withdrawal
of
energy
from
the
labour
due
to
the
community
at
large
they
had
a
monopoly
of
machinery
of
improvement
of
invention
both
in
agriculture
in
manufactures
and
in
they
devised
weapons
far
more
destructive
than
those
possessed
by
the
old
and
still
more
superior
to
such
as
after
centuries
of
anarchy
and
decline
the
communists
were
able
to
procure
finally
when
assailed
by
the
latter
vast
superiority
of
numbers
was
annulled
by
immeasurable
superiority
in
weapons
and
in
discipline
the
secessionists
were
animated
too
by
a
bitter
resentment
against
their
assailants
as
the
authors
of
the
general
ruin
and
of
much
individual
suffering
and
when
the
victory
was
gained
they
not
infrequently
improved
it
to
the
utter
destruction
of
all
who
had
taken
part
in
the
attack
whichever
side
were
most
to
blame
in
the
feud
no
quarter
was
given
by
either
it
was
an
internecine
war
of
numbers
ignorance
and
anarchy
against
science
and
order
on
both
sides
there
still
remained
much
of
the
spirit
generated
in
times
when
life
was
less
precious
than
the
valour
by
which
alone
it
could
be
held
and
preserved
through
milder
ages
by
the
belief
that
death
was
not
annihilation
enough
to
give
to
both
parties
courage
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
the
victory
of
their
cause
and
the
destruction
of
their
enemies
but
after
a
few
crushing
defeats
the
communists
were
compelled
to
sue
for
peace
and
to
cede
a
large
part
of
their
richest
territory
driven
back
into
their
own
chaotic
misery
deterred
by
merciless
punishment
from
further
invasion
of
their
neighbours
dominions
they
had
leisure
to
contrast
their
wretched
condition
with
that
of
those
who
prospered
under
the
restored
system
of
private
ownership
family
interest
strong
orderly
permanent
government
material
and
intellectual
civilisation
machinery
did
for
the
new
state
into
which
the
seceding
societies
were
consolidated
by
the
necessity
of
much
more
than
it
had
done
before
communism
declared
war
on
it
the
same
envy
which
if
war
had
been
any
longer
possible
would
have
urged
the
communists
again
and
again
to
plunder
the
wealth
that
contrasted
so
forcibly
their
own
increasing
poverty
now
humbled
them
to
admire
and
covet
the
means
which
had
produced
it
at
last
after
bitter
intestine
struggles
they
voluntarily
submitted
to
the
rule
of
their
rivals
and
entreated
the
latter
to
accept
them
as
subjects
and
pupils
thus
in
the
century
order
and
property
were
once
more
established
throughout
the
planet
but
as
i
have
said
what
you
call
religion
had
altogether
disappeared
had
ceased
at
least
as
an
avowed
principle
to
affect
the
ideas
and
conduct
of
society
or
of
individuals
the
of
peace
and
order
concentrated
men
energies
on
the
production
of
material
wealth
and
the
achievement
of
physical
comfort
and
ease
looking
forward
to
nothing
after
death
they
could
only
make
the
best
of
the
short
life
permitted
to
them
and
do
their
utmost
to
lengthen
it
in
the
assurance
of
speedy
separation
affection
became
a
source
of
much
more
anxiety
and
sorrow
than
happiness
all
ties
being
precarious
and
their
endurance
short
their
force
became
less
and
less
till
the
utmost
enjoyment
of
the
longest
possible
life
for
himself
became
the
sole
or
almost
the
sole
animating
motive
the
one
paramount
interest
of
each
individual
the
equality
which
logic
had
established
between
the
sexes
dissolved
the
family
tie
it
was
impossible
for
law
to
dictate
the
conditions
on
which
two
free
and
equal
individuals
should
live
together
merely
because
they
differed
in
sex
all
the
state
could
do
it
did
it
insisted
on
a
provision
for
the
children
but
when
parental
affection
was
extinguished
such
provision
could
only
be
secured
by
handing
over
the
infant
and
its
portion
to
the
guardianship
of
the
state
as
children
were
troublesome
and
noisy
the
practice
of
giving
them
up
to
public
officers
to
be
brought
up
in
vast
nurseries
regulated
on
the
strictest
scientific
principles
became
the
general
rule
and
was
soon
regarded
as
a
duty
what
was
at
first
almost
openly
avowed
selfishness
soon
justifying
and
glorifying
itself
on
the
ground
that
the
children
were
better
off
under
the
care
of
those
whose
undivided
attention
was
given
to
them
and
in
establishments
where
everything
was
regulated
with
sole
regard
to
their
welfare
than
they
could
be
at
home
no
law
compels
us
to
send
our
children
to
these
establishments
in
rare
cases
a
favourite
will
persuade
her
lord
to
retain
her
pet
son
and
make
him
heir
but
both
the
courts
and
public
opinion
discountenance
this
practice
some
families
like
my
own
systematically
retain
their
children
and
educate
them
at
home
but
it
is
generally
thought
that
in
doing
so
we
do
them
a
wrong
and
our
neighbours
look
askance
upon
so
signal
a
deviation
from
custom
the
more
so
perhaps
that
they
half
suspect
us
of
dissenting
from
their
views
on
other
subjects
on
which
our
opinions
do
not
so
directly
or
so
obviously
affect
our
conduct
and
on
which
therefore
we
are
not
so
easily
convicted
of
free
choice
heresy
here
i
inquired
whether
the
birth
and
parentage
of
the
children
sent
to
the
public
establishments
were
registered
so
as
to
permit
their
being
reclaimed
or
inheriting
property
no
he
replied
inheritance
by
mere
descent
is
a
notion
no
longer
favoured
i
believe
that
young
mothers
sometimes
before
parting
with
their
children
impress
upon
them
some
indelible
mark
by
which
it
may
be
possible
hereafter
to
recognise
them
but
such
recognitions
seldom
occur
maternal
affection
is
discountenanced
as
a
purely
animal
instinct
a
survival
from
a
lower
grade
of
organisation
and
does
not
generally
outlast
a
ten
years
separation
while
paternal
love
is
utterly
scouted
as
an
absurdity
to
which
even
the
higher
animals
are
not
subject
boys
are
kept
in
the
public
establishments
until
the
age
of
twelve
those
from
ten
to
twelve
being
separated
from
the
younger
ones
and
passing
through
the
higher
education
in
separate
colleges
the
girls
are
educated
apart
till
they
complete
their
tenth
year
and
are
almost
invariably
married
in
the
course
of
the
next
at
first
under
the
influence
of
the
theory
of
sexual
equality
both
received
their
intellectual
instruction
in
the
same
classes
and
passed
through
the
same
examinations
separation
was
soon
found
necessary
but
still
girls
passed
through
the
same
intellectual
training
as
their
brothers
experience
however
showed
that
this
would
not
answer
those
girls
who
distinguished
themselves
in
the
examinations
were
with
scarcely
an
exception
found
unattractive
as
wives
and
unfit
to
be
mothers
a
very
much
larger
number
a
number
increasing
in
every
generation
suffered
unmistakably
from
the
severity
of
the
mental
discipline
to
which
they
were
subjected
the
advocates
of
female
equality
made
a
very
hard
fight
for
equal
culture
but
the
physical
consequences
were
perfectly
clear
and
perfectly
intolerable
when
a
point
was
reached
at
which
one
half
the
girls
of
each
generation
were
rendered
invalids
for
life
and
the
other
half
protected
only
by
a
dense
stupidity
or
volatile
idleness
which
no
school
punishments
could
overcome
the
equalists
were
driven
from
one
untenable
point
to
another
and
forced
at
last
to
demand
a
reduction
of
the
masculine
standard
of
education
to
the
level
of
feminine
capacities
upon
this
ground
they
took
their
last
stand
and
were
hopelessly
beaten
the
reaction
was
so
complete
that
for
the
last
two
hundred
and
forty
generations
the
standard
of
female
education
has
been
lowered
to
that
which
by
general
confession
ordinary
female
brains
can
stand
without
injury
to
the
physique
the
practical
consequences
of
sexual
equality
have
in
a
more
absolute
form
than
ever
the
principle
that
the
first
purpose
of
female
life
is
marriage
and
maternity
and
that
for
their
own
sakes
as
for
the
sake
of
each
successive
generation
women
should
be
so
trained
as
to
be
attractive
wives
and
mothers
of
healthy
children
all
other
considerations
being
subordinated
to
these
a
certain
small
number
of
ladies
avail
themselves
of
the
legal
equality
they
still
enjoy
and
live
in
the
world
much
as
men
but
we
regard
them
as
men
in
petticoats
hardly
as
women
at
all
marriage
with
one
of
them
is
the
last
resource
to
which
a
man
too
idle
or
too
foolish
to
earn
his
own
living
will
betake
himself
whatever
their
education
our
women
have
always
found
that
such
independence
as
they
could
earn
by
hard
work
was
less
satisfactory
than
the
dependence
coupled
with
assured
comfort
and
ease
which
they
enjoy
as
the
consorts
playthings
or
slaves
of
the
other
sex
and
they
are
only
too
glad
to
barter
their
legal
equality
for
the
certainty
of
protection
indolence
and
permanent
support
then
your
marriages
i
said
are
permanent
not
by
law
he
replied
nothing
like
what
our
remote
ancestors
called
marriage
is
recognised
at
all
the
maidens
who
come
of
age
each
year
sell
themselves
by
a
sort
of
auction
those
who
purchase
them
arranging
with
the
girls
themselves
the
terms
on
which
the
latter
will
enter
their
family
custom
has
fixed
the
general
conditions
which
every
girl
expects
and
which
only
the
least
attractive
are
forced
to
forego
they
are
promised
a
permanent
maintenance
from
their
estate
and
promise
in
return
a
fixed
term
of
marriage
after
two
or
three
years
they
are
free
to
rescind
the
contract
after
ten
or
twelve
they
may
leave
their
husbands
with
a
stipulated
pension
they
receive
an
allowance
for
dress
and
so
forth
proportionate
to
their
personal
attractions
or
to
the
fancy
of
the
suitor
and
of
course
the
richest
men
can
offer
the
best
terms
and
generally
secure
the
most
agreeable
wives
in
whatever
number
they
please
or
think
they
can
without
inconvenience
support
then
i
said
the
women
can
divorce
themselves
at
pleasure
but
the
men
can
not
dismiss
them
this
hardly
looks
like
equality
the
practical
result
he
answered
is
that
men
do
care
for
a
release
which
would
part
them
from
complaisant
slaves
and
that
women
dare
not
seek
a
divorce
which
can
only
hand
them
over
to
another
master
on
rather
worse
terms
when
the
longer
term
has
expired
the
latter
almost
always
prefer
the
servitude
to
which
they
are
accustomed
to
an
independent
life
of
solitude
and
friendlessness
and
what
becomes
i
asked
of
the
younger
men
who
must
enter
the
world
without
property
without
parents
or
protectors
we
are
after
youth
has
passed
an
indolent
race
we
hardly
care
as
a
rule
to
cultivate
our
fields
or
direct
our
factories
but
prefer
devoting
the
latter
half
at
least
of
our
lives
to
a
somewhat
cultivation
of
that
division
of
science
which
takes
hold
of
our
fancy
these
divisions
are
such
as
your
conversation
leads
me
to
think
you
would
probably
consider
absurdly
minute
a
single
class
of
insects
a
single
family
of
plants
the
habits
of
one
race
of
fishes
suffice
for
the
exclusive
study
of
half
a
lifetime
minds
of
a
more
active
or
more
practical
bent
will
spend
an
equal
time
over
the
construction
of
a
new
machine
more
absolutely
automatic
than
any
that
has
preceded
it
physical
labour
is
thrown
as
much
as
possible
on
the
young
and
even
they
are
now
so
helped
by
machinery
and
by
trained
animals
that
the
eight
hours
work
which
forms
their
day
labour
hardly
tires
their
muscles
our
tastes
render
us
very
anxious
to
devolve
upon
others
as
soon
as
possible
the
preservation
and
development
of
the
property
we
have
acquired
a
man
of
moderate
means
long
before
he
has
reached
his
thirtieth
year
generally
seeks
one
assistant
men
of
larger
fortune
may
want
two
five
or
ten
these
are
chosen
as
a
rule
by
preference
from
those
who
have
passed
the
most
stringent
and
successful
collegiate
examination
martial
parents
are
not
prolific
and
the
mortality
in
our
public
nurseries
is
very
large
i
impute
it
to
moral
influences
since
the
chief
cause
of
death
is
low
vitality
marked
nervous
depression
and
want
of
animal
spirits
such
as
the
total
absence
of
personal
tenderness
and
sympathy
must
produce
in
children
it
is
popularly
ascribed
to
the
of
the
race
as
plants
and
animals
highly
civilised
that
is
greatly
modified
and
bred
to
an
artificial
excellence
by
human
agency
are
certainly
delicate
unprolific
and
especially
difficult
to
rear
there
is
little
disease
in
the
nurseries
but
there
is
little
health
and
a
deficiency
of
nervous
energy
one
fact
is
significant
however
interpreted
and
bears
directly
on
your
last
question
since
the
wide
extension
of
polygamy
female
births
are
to
male
about
as
seven
to
six
but
the
deaths
in
public
nurseries
between
the
first
and
tenth
years
are
in
twelve
dozen
admissions
in
the
stronger
sex
and
only
about
ten
in
the
weaker
read
these
facts
as
we
may
they
ensure
employment
to
the
young
men
when
their
education
is
completed
the
two
last
years
of
severe
study
adding
somewhat
to
the
mortality
among
them
a
large
number
find
employment
in
superintending
the
property
of
others
to
give
them
a
practical
interest
in
its
preservation
and
improvement
they
are
generally
after
a
shorter
or
longer
probation
adopted
by
their
employers
as
heirs
to
their
estate
our
experience
of
communism
having
taught
us
that
immediate
and
obvious
is
the
only
motive
that
certainly
and
seriously
affects
human
action
the
distance
at
which
they
are
kept
and
the
absolute
seclusion
of
our
family
life
enables
us
easily
to
secure
ourselves
against
any
on
their
part
to
anticipate
their
inheritance
the
minority
who
do
not
thus
find
a
regular
place
in
society
are
employed
in
factories
as
artisans
or
on
the
lands
belonging
to
the
state
to
ensure
their
zeal
the
last
receive
a
fixed
proportion
of
the
produce
or
are
permitted
to
rent
land
at
fixed
rates
and
at
the
end
of
ten
years
receive
a
part
thereof
in
full
property
by
these
means
we
are
free
from
all
the
dangers
and
difficulties
of
that
state
of
society
which
preceded
the
communistic
cataclysm
we
have
poor
men
and
men
who
can
live
only
by
daily
labour
but
these
have
dissipated
their
wealth
or
are
looking
forward
at
no
very
distant
period
to
a
sufficient
competence
the
entire
population
of
our
planet
does
not
exceed
two
hundred
millions
and
is
not
much
increased
from
generation
to
generation
the
area
of
cultivable
land
is
about
ten
millions
of
square
miles
and
half
a
square
mile
in
these
equatorial
continents
which
alone
are
at
all
generally
inhabited
will
if
well
cultivated
and
cared
for
furnish
the
largest
household
with
every
luxury
that
man
heart
can
desire
eight
hours
labour
in
the
day
for
ten
years
of
life
will
secure
to
the
least
fortunate
a
reasonable
competence
and
an
ambitious
man
with
quick
intelligence
and
reasonable
industry
may
always
hope
to
become
rich
if
he
thinks
wealth
worth
the
labour
of
invention
or
of
exceptionally
troublesome
work
mars
ought
then
i
said
to
be
a
material
paradise
you
have
attained
nearly
all
that
our
most
advanced
political
economists
regard
as
the
perfection
of
economical
order
a
population
nearly
stationary
and
a
soil
much
more
than
adequate
to
their
support
a
general
distribution
of
property
total
absence
of
permanent
poverty
and
freedom
from
that
gnawing
anxiety
regarding
the
future
of
ourselves
or
our
children
which
is
the
great
evil
of
life
upon
earth
and
the
opprobrium
of
our
social
arrangements
you
have
carried
out
moreover
the
doctrines
of
our
most
advanced
philosophers
you
have
absolute
equality
before
the
law
competitive
examination
among
the
young
for
the
best
start
in
life
with
equal
chances
wherever
equality
is
possible
and
again
perfect
freedom
and
full
legal
equality
as
regards
the
relations
of
the
sexes
are
your
countrymen
satisfied
with
the
results
yes
answered
my
host
in
so
far
at
least
that
they
have
no
wish
to
change
them
no
idea
that
any
great
social
or
political
reforms
could
improve
our
condition
our
lesson
in
communism
has
rendered
all
agitation
on
such
matters
all
tendency
to
democratic
institutions
all
appeals
to
popular
passions
utterly
odious
and
alarming
to
us
but
that
we
are
happy
i
will
venture
neither
to
affirm
nor
to
deny
physically
no
doubt
we
have
great
advantages
over
you
if
i
rightly
understand
your
description
of
life
on
earth
we
have
got
rid
of
old
age
and
to
a
great
extent
of
disease
many
of
our
scientists
persist
in
the
hope
to
get
rid
of
death
but
since
all
that
has
been
accomplished
in
this
direction
was
accomplished
some
two
thousand
years
back
and
yet
we
continue
to
die
general
opinion
hardly
concurs
in
this
hope
how
do
you
mean
i
inquired
that
you
have
got
rid
of
old
age
and
of
disease
we
have
he
replied
learned
pretty
fully
the
chemistry
of
life
we
have
found
remedies
for
that
hardening
of
the
bones
and
weakening
of
the
muscles
which
used
to
be
the
physical
characteristics
of
declining
years
our
hair
no
longer
whitens
our
teeth
if
they
decay
are
now
removed
and
naturally
replaced
by
new
ones
our
eyes
retain
to
the
last
the
clearness
of
their
sight
a
famous
physician
of
five
thousand
years
back
said
in
controversy
on
this
subject
that
clock
was
not
made
to
go
for
ever
by
which
he
meant
that
human
bodies
like
the
materials
of
machines
wore
out
by
lapse
of
time
in
his
day
this
was
true
since
it
was
impossible
fully
to
repair
the
waste
and
physical
wear
and
tear
of
the
human
frame
this
is
no
longer
so
the
clock
does
not
wear
out
but
it
goes
more
and
more
slowly
and
irregularly
and
stops
at
last
for
some
reason
that
the
most
skilful
inspection
can
not
discover
the
body
of
him
who
dies
as
we
say
efflux
of
time
at
the
age
of
fifty
is
as
perfect
as
it
was
at
twenty
yet
few
men
live
to
be
and
most
have
ceased
to
take
much
interest
in
practical
life
or
even
in
science
by
that
seems
strange
i
said
if
no
foreign
body
gets
into
the
machinery
and
the
machinery
itself
does
not
wear
out
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
the
clock
should
cease
to
go
would
not
some
of
your
race
he
asked
explain
the
mystery
by
suggesting
that
the
human
frame
is
not
a
clock
but
contains
and
owes
its
life
to
an
essence
beyond
the
reach
of
the
scalpel
the
microscope
and
the
laboratory
they
hold
that
it
is
so
but
then
it
is
not
the
soul
but
the
body
that
is
worn
out
in
seventy
or
eighty
of
the
earth
revolutions
ay
he
said
but
if
man
were
such
a
duplex
being
it
might
be
that
the
wearing
out
of
the
body
was
necessary
and
had
been
adapted
to
release
the
soul
when
it
had
completed
its
appropriate
term
of
service
in
the
flesh
i
could
not
answer
this
question
and
he
did
not
pursue
the
theme
presently
i
inquired
if
you
allow
no
appeal
to
popular
feeling
or
passion
to
what
was
i
so
nearly
the
victim
and
what
is
the
terrorism
that
makes
it
dangerous
to
avow
a
credulity
or
incredulity
opposed
to
received
opinion
scientific
controversies
he
replied
enlist
our
strongest
and
angriest
feelings
it
is
held
that
only
wickedness
or
lunacy
can
resist
the
evidence
that
has
convinced
a
vast
majority
by
arithmetical
calculation
the
chances
that
twelve
men
are
wrong
and
twelve
thousand
right
on
a
matter
of
inductive
or
deductive
proof
are
found
to
amount
to
what
must
be
taken
for
practical
certainty
and
when
the
twelve
still
hold
out
they
are
regarded
as
madmen
or
knaves
and
treated
accordingly
by
their
fellows
if
it
be
thought
desirable
to
invoke
a
legal
settlement
of
the
issue
a
council
of
all
the
overseers
of
our
scientific
colleges
is
called
and
its
decision
is
by
law
irrevocable
and
infallible
especially
if
ratified
by
the
popular
voice
and
if
a
majority
vote
be
worth
anything
at
all
i
think
this
modern
theory
at
least
as
sound
as
the
democratic
theory
of
politics
which
prevailed
here
before
the
communistic
revolution
and
which
seems
by
your
account
to
be
gaining
ground
on
earth
and
what
i
inquired
is
your
political
constitution
what
are
the
powers
of
your
rulers
and
how
in
the
absence
of
public
discussion
and
popular
suffrage
are
they
practically
limited
in
theory
they
are
unlimited
he
answered
in
practice
they
are
limited
by
custom
by
caution
and
above
all
by
the
lack
of
motives
for
misrule
the
authority
of
each
prince
over
those
under
him
from
the
sovereign
to
the
local
president
or
captain
is
absolute
but
the
executive
leaves
ordinary
matters
of
civil
or
criminal
law
to
the
courts
of
justice
cases
are
tried
by
trained
judges
the
old
democratic
usage
of
employing
untrained
juries
having
been
long
ago
discarded
as
a
worse
superstition
than
simple
decision
by
lot
the
lot
is
right
twelve
times
in
two
dozen
the
jury
not
oftener
than
times
the
judges
do
heat
or
bias
their
minds
by
discussion
they
hear
all
that
can
be
elicited
from
parties
accuser
accused
and
witnesses
and
all
that
skilled
advocates
can
say
then
the
secretary
of
the
court
draws
up
a
summary
of
the
case
each
judge
takes
it
home
to
consider
each
writes
out
his
judgment
which
is
read
by
the
secretary
none
but
the
author
knowing
whose
it
is
if
the
majority
be
five
to
two
judgment
is
given
if
less
the
case
is
tried
again
before
a
higher
tribunal
of
twice
as
many
judges
if
no
decision
can
be
reached
the
accused
is
acquitted
for
the
time
or
in
a
civil
dispute
a
compromise
is
imposed
the
rulers
can
not
without
incurring
such
general
anger
as
would
be
fatal
to
their
power
disregard
our
fundamental
laws
gross
tyranny
to
individuals
is
too
dangerous
to
be
carried
far
it
is
a
capital
crime
for
any
but
the
officers
of
the
sovereign
and
of
the
twelve
regents
to
possess
the
fearfully
destructive
weapons
that
brought
our
last
wars
to
an
end
but
any
man
driven
to
desperation
can
construct
and
use
similar
weapons
so
easily
that
no
ruler
will
drive
a
man
to
such
revengeful
despair
again
the
tyranny
of
subordinate
officials
would
be
checked
by
their
chief
who
would
be
angry
at
being
troubled
and
endangered
by
misconduct
in
which
he
had
no
direct
interest
and
finally
malice
is
not
a
strong
passion
among
us
and
our
manners
render
it
unlikely
that
a
ruler
should
come
into
such
collision
with
any
of
his
subjects
as
would
engender
such
a
feeling
of
those
immediately
about
him
he
can
and
does
at
once
get
rid
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
dislike
and
before
he
has
cause
to
hate
them
it
is
our
maxim
that
greed
of
wealth
or
lust
of
power
are
the
chief
motives
of
tyranny
our
rulers
can
not
well
hope
to
extend
a
power
already
autocratic
and
we
take
care
to
leave
them
nothing
to
covet
in
the
way
of
wealth
we
can
afford
to
give
them
all
that
they
can
desire
of
luxury
and
splendour
to
enrich
to
the
uttermost
a
few
dozen
governors
costs
us
nothing
comparable
to
the
cost
of
democracy
with
its
inseparable
party
conflicts
maladministration
neglect
and
confusion
a
clever
writer
on
earth
lately
remarked
that
it
would
be
easy
to
satiate
princes
with
all
personal
enjoyments
but
impossible
to
satiate
all
their
or
even
all
the
members
of
their
family
you
must
remember
he
replied
that
we
have
here
save
in
such
exceptional
cases
as
my
own
nothing
like
what
you
call
a
family
the
ladies
of
a
prince
house
have
everything
they
can
wish
for
within
their
bounds
and
can
not
go
outside
of
these
as
for
dependents
no
man
here
at
least
of
such
as
are
likely
to
be
rulers
cares
for
his
nearest
and
dearest
friends
enough
to
incur
personal
peril
public
displeasure
or
private
resentment
on
their
account
the
officials
around
a
ruler
person
are
few
in
number
so
that
we
can
afford
to
make
their
places
too
comfortable
and
too
valuable
to
be
lightly
risked
neglect
again
is
pretty
sure
to
be
punished
by
superior
authority
activity
in
the
promotion
of
public
objects
is
the
only
interest
left
to
princes
while
tyranny
is
for
the
reasons
i
have
given
too
dangerous
to
be
carried
far
chapter
vi
an
official
visit
at
this
point
of
our
conversation
an
ambâ
entered
the
room
and
made
certain
signs
which
my
host
immediately
understood
the
zamptâ
he
said
has
called
upon
me
evidently
on
your
account
and
probably
with
some
message
from
his
suzerain
you
need
not
be
afraid
he
added
at
worst
they
would
only
refuse
you
protection
and
i
could
secure
you
from
danger
under
my
own
roof
and
in
the
last
extremity
effect
your
retreat
and
return
to
your
own
planet
supposing
for
a
moment
he
added
smiling
that
you
are
a
real
being
and
come
from
a
real
world
the
regent
of
that
dominion
the
only
martialist
outside
my
family
with
whom
i
had
yet
been
able
to
converse
awaited
us
in
the
hall
or
entrance
chamber
i
bowed
low
to
him
and
then
remained
standing
my
host
also
saluting
his
visitor
at
once
took
his
seat
the
regent
returning
the
salute
and
seating
himself
proceeded
to
address
us
very
little
ceremony
on
either
side
being
observed
between
this
autocratic
deputy
of
an
absolute
sovereign
and
his
subjects
esmo
said
the
regent
will
you
point
out
the
person
you
declare
yourself
to
have
rescued
from
assault
and
received
into
your
house
on
the
day
of
this
year
that
is
the
person
regent
said
my
host
pointing
to
me
the
visitor
then
asked
my
name
which
i
gave
and
addressing
me
thereby
he
continued
the
camptâ
has
requested
me
to
ascertain
the
truth
regarding
your
alleged
size
so
far
exceeding
anything
hitherto
known
among
us
you
will
permit
me
therefore
to
measure
your
height
and
girth
i
bowed
and
he
proceeded
to
ascertain
that
i
was
about
a
foot
taller
and
some
ten
inches
larger
round
the
waist
than
himself
of
these
facts
he
took
note
and
then
proceeded
the
signs
you
made
to
those
who
first
encountered
you
were
understood
to
mean
that
you
descended
from
the
sky
in
a
vessel
which
is
now
left
on
the
summit
of
yonder
mountain
asnyca
i
did
not
descend
from
the
sky
i
replied
for
the
sky
is
as
we
both
know
no
actual
vault
or
boundary
of
the
atmospheric
depths
i
ascended
from
a
world
nearer
to
the
sun
and
after
travelling
for
forty
days
through
space
landed
upon
this
planet
in
the
vessel
you
mention
i
am
directed
he
answered
to
see
this
vessel
to
inspect
your
machinery
and
instruments
and
to
report
thereon
to
the
suzerain
you
will
doubtless
be
ready
to
accompany
me
thither
two
hours
after
sunrise
you
may
be
accompanied
if
you
please
by
your
host
or
any
members
of
his
family
i
shall
be
attended
by
one
or
more
of
my
officers
in
the
meantime
i
am
to
inform
you
that
until
my
report
has
been
received
and
considered
you
are
under
the
protection
of
the
law
and
need
not
apprehend
any
molestation
of
the
kind
you
incurred
at
first
you
will
not
however
repeat
to
any
one
but
myself
the
explanation
you
have
offered
of
your
appearance
which
i
understand
has
been
given
in
fuller
detail
to
esmo
until
the
decision
of
the
camptâ
shall
have
been
communicated
to
you
i
simply
bowed
my
assent
and
after
this
brief
but
sufficient
fulfilment
of
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
called
the
regent
took
his
leave
what
i
asked
when
we
my
chamber
is
the
meaning
of
the
title
by
which
the
regent
addressed
you
in
speaking
to
officials
he
replied
of
rank
so
high
as
his
it
is
customary
to
address
them
simply
by
their
titles
unless
more
than
one
of
the
same
rank
be
present
in
which
case
we
call
them
as
we
do
inferior
officials
by
their
name
with
the
title
appended
for
instance
in
the
court
of
the
sovereign
our
regent
would
be
called
endo
zamptâ
men
of
a
certain
age
and
social
position
but
having
no
office
are
addressed
by
their
name
and
that
of
their
residence
and
meaning
a
town
or
dwelling
usage
gives
me
the
name
of
esmo
in
or
of
the
town
of
eca
i
am
sorry
he
went
on
that
neither
my
son
nor
myself
can
accompany
you
all
the
elder
members
of
my
family
are
engaged
to
attend
at
some
distance
hence
before
the
hour
at
which
you
can
return
but
i
should
not
like
you
to
be
alone
with
strangers
and
independently
of
this
consideration
i
should
perhaps
have
asked
of
you
a
somewhat
unusual
favour
my
daughter
eveena
who
like
most
of
women
he
laid
a
special
emphasis
on
the
pronoun
has
received
a
better
education
than
is
now
given
in
the
public
academies
has
been
from
the
first
greatly
interested
in
your
narrative
and
in
all
you
have
told
us
of
the
world
from
which
you
come
she
is
anxious
to
see
your
vessel
and
i
had
hoped
to
take
her
when
i
meant
to
visit
it
in
your
company
but
after
i
can
not
tell
when
you
may
be
summoned
to
visit
the
camptâ
or
whether
after
that
visit
you
are
likely
to
return
hither
i
will
ask
you
therefore
if
you
do
not
object
to
what
i
confess
is
an
unusual
proceeding
to
take
eveena
under
your
charge
is
it
i
inquired
permissible
for
a
young
lady
to
accompany
a
stranger
on
such
an
excursion
it
is
very
unusual
returned
my
host
but
you
must
observe
that
here
family
ties
are
as
a
rule
unknown
it
can
not
be
usual
for
a
maiden
to
be
attended
by
father
or
brother
since
she
knows
neither
it
is
only
by
a
husband
that
a
girl
can
as
a
rule
be
attended
abroad
our
usages
render
such
attendance
exceedingly
close
and
on
the
other
hand
forbid
strangers
to
interrupt
or
take
notice
thereof
in
eveena
presence
the
regent
will
find
it
difficult
to
draw
you
into
conversation
which
might
be
inconvenient
or
dangerous
and
especially
can
not
attempt
to
gratify
by
questioning
you
any
curiosity
as
to
myself
or
my
family
but
i
said
from
what
you
say
it
seems
that
the
regent
and
any
one
who
might
accompany
him
would
draw
inferences
which
might
not
be
agreeable
to
you
or
to
the
young
lady
i
hardly
understand
you
he
replied
the
only
conjecture
they
could
make
which
they
will
certainly
make
is
that
you
are
or
are
about
to
be
married
to
her
and
as
they
will
never
see
her
again
and
if
they
did
could
not
recognise
her
as
they
will
not
know
anything
save
that
she
belongs
to
my
household
and
certainly
will
not
speak
to
her
i
do
not
see
how
their
inference
can
affect
her
when
i
part
with
her
it
will
be
to
some
one
of
my
own
customs
and
opinions
and
to
us
this
close
confinement
of
girls
appears
to
transcend
reasonable
restraint
as
it
contradicts
the
theoretical
freedom
and
equality
granted
by
law
to
the
sex
but
utterly
withheld
by
the
social
usages
which
have
grown
out
of
that
law
i
can
only
thank
you
for
giving
me
a
companion
more
agreeable
than
the
official
who
is
to
report
upon
my
reality
i
said
i
do
not
desire
he
continued
to
bind
you
to
any
reserve
in
replying
to
questions
beyond
what
i
am
sure
you
will
do
without
a
pledge
namely
to
avoid
betraying
more
than
you
can
help
of
that
which
is
not
known
outside
my
own
household
but
on
this
subject
i
may
be
able
to
speak
more
fully
after
now
if
you
will
come
into
the
peristyle
we
shall
be
in
time
for
the
evening
meal
eveena
curiosity
had
in
nowise
overcome
her
silent
shyness
she
might
possibly
have
completed
her
tenth
year
which
epoch
in
the
life
of
mars
is
about
equivalent
to
the
seventeenth
birthday
of
a
damsel
nurtured
in
europe
i
hardly
think
that
i
had
addressed
her
directly
times
or
had
received
from
her
a
dozen
words
in
return
i
had
been
attracted
nevertheless
not
only
by
her
grace
and
beauty
but
by
the
peculiar
sweetness
of
her
voice
and
the
gentleness
of
her
manner
and
bearing
when
engaged
in
pacifying
dispute
or
difficulty
among
the
children
and
particularly
in
dealing
with
the
spoilt
infant
of
which
i
have
spoken
this
evening
that
little
brat
was
more
than
usually
exasperating
and
having
exhausted
the
patience
or
repelled
the
company
of
all
the
rest
found
itself
alone
and
set
up
a
fretful
continuous
scream
disagreeable
even
to
me
and
torturing
to
martial
ears
which
adapted
to
hear
in
that
thin
air
are
painfully
alive
to
strident
harsh
or
even
loud
sounds
instantly
obeying
a
sign
from
her
mother
eveena
rose
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation
to
which
she
had
listened
with
evident
interest
and
devoted
herself
for
to
please
and
pacify
this
uncomfortable
child
the
character
and
appearance
of
this
infant
so
utterly
unlike
all
its
companions
had
already
excited
my
curiosity
but
i
had
found
no
opportunity
of
asking
a
question
without
risking
an
impertinence
on
this
occasion
however
i
ventured
to
make
some
remark
on
the
extreme
gentleness
and
forbearance
with
which
not
only
eveena
but
the
children
treated
their
peevish
and
exacting
brother
he
is
no
brother
of
theirs
said
zulve
the
mistress
of
the
house
you
would
hardly
find
in
any
family
like
ours
a
child
with
so
irritable
a
temper
or
a
disposition
so
selfish
and
nowhere
a
creature
so
hardly
treated
by
nature
in
body
as
well
as
mind
indeed
i
said
hardly
understanding
her
answer
no
said
my
host
it
is
the
rule
to
deprive
of
life
promptly
and
painlessly
children
to
whom
from
physical
deformity
or
defect
life
is
thought
unlikely
to
be
pleasant
and
whose
descendants
might
be
a
burden
to
the
public
and
a
cause
of
physical
deterioration
to
the
race
it
is
however
one
of
the
exceptional
tenets
to
which
i
have
been
obliged
to
allude
that
man
should
not
seek
to
be
wiser
than
nature
and
that
life
should
neither
be
cut
short
except
as
a
punishment
for
great
crimes
nor
prolonged
artificially
contrary
to
the
manifest
intention
or
as
our
philosophers
would
say
the
common
course
of
nature
those
who
think
with
me
therefore
always
endeavour
when
we
hear
in
time
of
their
approaching
fate
to
preserve
children
so
doomed
precautions
against
undue
haste
or
readiness
to
destroy
lives
that
might
after
all
grow
up
to
health
and
vigour
are
provided
by
law
no
single
physician
or
physiologist
can
sign
a
and
i
though
no
longer
a
physician
by
craft
am
among
the
arbiters
one
or
more
of
whom
must
be
called
in
to
approve
or
suspend
the
decision
on
these
occasions
i
have
rescued
from
extinction
several
children
of
whose
unfitness
to
live
according
to
the
standard
of
the
state
nurseries
there
was
no
question
and
placed
them
in
families
mostly
childless
that
were
willing
to
receive
them
of
this
one
it
was
our
turn
to
take
charge
and
certainly
his
chance
is
better
for
being
brought
up
among
other
children
and
under
the
influence
of
their
gentler
dispositions
and
less
exacting
temperaments
and
is
such
and
selfishness
i
asked
generally
found
among
the
deformed
i
do
think
replied
esmo
that
this
child
is
much
worse
than
most
of
my
neighbours
children
except
that
physical
discomfort
makes
him
fretful
what
you
call
selfishness
in
him
is
only
the
natural
inheritance
derived
from
an
ancestry
who
for
some
hundred
generations
have
certainly
never
cared
for
anything
or
any
one
but
themselves
i
thought
i
had
explained
to
you
by
what
train
of
circumstances
and
of
reasoning
family
affection
such
as
it
is
reputed
to
have
been
thousands
of
years
ago
has
become
extinct
in
this
planet
and
family
affection
extinguished
all
weaker
sentiments
of
regard
for
others
were
very
quickly
withered
up
you
told
me
something
of
the
kind
i
said
but
the
idea
of
a
life
so
utterly
swallowed
up
in
self
that
no
one
even
thinks
it
necessary
to
affect
regard
for
and
interest
in
others
was
to
me
so
unintelligible
and
inconceivable
that
i
did
not
realise
the
full
meaning
of
your
account
nor
even
now
do
i
understand
how
a
society
formed
of
such
members
can
be
held
together
on
earth
we
should
expect
them
either
to
tear
one
another
to
pieces
or
to
relapse
into
isolation
and
barbarism
lower
than
that
of
the
lowest
tribe
which
preserves
social
instincts
and
social
organisation
a
society
composed
of
men
resembling
that
child
but
with
the
intelligence
force
and
consistent
purpose
of
manhood
would
i
should
have
thought
be
little
better
than
a
congregation
of
beasts
of
prey
we
have
such
beasts
said
esmo
in
the
wild
lands
and
they
are
certainly
unsociable
and
solitary
but
men
at
least
civilised
men
are
governed
not
only
by
instinct
but
by
interest
and
the
interest
of
each
individual
in
the
preservation
of
social
and
social
order
is
very
evident
and
very
powerful
experience
and
school
discipline
cure
children
of
the
habit
of
indulging
mere
temper
and
spite
before
they
come
to
be
men
and
they
are
taught
by
practice
as
well
as
by
precept
the
absolute
necessity
of
egotism
therefore
has
no
tendency
to
dissolve
society
as
a
mere
organisation
though
it
has
utterly
destroyed
society
as
a
source
of
pleasure
does
your
law
i
asked
confine
the
principle
of
euthanasia
to
infants
or
do
you
put
out
of
the
world
adults
whose
life
is
supposed
for
one
reason
or
another
to
be
useless
and
joyless
only
he
answered
in
the
case
of
the
insane
when
the
doctors
are
satisfied
that
a
lunatic
can
not
be
cured
an
inquest
is
held
and
if
the
medical
verdict
be
approved
he
is
quietly
and
painlessly
dismissed
from
existence
logically
of
course
the
same
principle
should
be
applied
to
all
incurable
disease
and
i
suspect
indeed
i
know
that
it
is
applied
when
the
household
have
become
weary
and
the
patient
is
utterly
unable
to
protect
himself
or
appeal
to
the
law
but
the
general
application
of
the
principle
has
been
successfully
resisted
on
the
ground
that
the
terror
it
would
cause
the
constant
anxiety
and
alarm
in
which
men
would
live
if
the
right
of
judging
when
life
had
become
worthless
to
them
were
left
to
others
would
far
outweigh
any
benefit
which
might
be
derived
from
the
legalised
extinction
of
existences
which
had
become
a
prolonged
misery
and
such
cases
as
i
have
told
you
are
very
rare
among
us
a
case
of
hopeless
bodily
suffering
not
terminating
very
speedily
in
death
does
not
occur
thrice
a
year
among
the
whole
population
of
the
planet
except
through
accident
we
have
means
of
curing
at
the
outset
almost
all
of
those
diseases
which
the
observance
for
hundreds
of
generations
of
sound
physical
conditions
of
life
has
not
extirpated
and
in
the
worst
instances
our
anæsthetics
seldom
fail
to
extinguish
the
sense
of
pain
without
impairing
intellect
of
course
any
one
who
is
tired
of
his
life
is
at
liberty
to
put
an
end
to
it
and
any
one
else
may
assist
him
but
though
the
clinging
to
existence
is
perhaps
the
most
irrational
of
all
those
purely
animal
instincts
on
emancipation
from
which
we
pride
ourselves
it
is
the
strongest
and
the
most
lasting
the
life
of
most
of
my
countrymen
would
be
to
me
intolerable
weariness
if
only
from
the
utter
want
after
wealth
is
attained
of
all
warmer
and
less
isolated
interest
than
some
one
pet
scientific
pursuit
can
afford
and
yet
more
from
the
total
absence
of
affection
family
duties
and
the
various
mental
occupations
which
interest
in
others
affords
but
though
the
question
whether
life
is
worth
living
has
long
ago
been
settled
among
us
in
the
negative
suicide
the
logical
outcome
of
that
conviction
is
the
rarest
of
all
the
methods
by
which
life
is
terminated
which
seems
to
show
that
even
in
mars
logic
does
not
always
dominate
life
and
prevail
over
instinct
but
what
is
the
most
usual
cause
of
death
where
neither
disease
nor
senility
are
other
than
rare
exceptions
efflux
of
time
esmo
replied
with
an
ironical
smile
that
is
the
chief
fatal
disease
recognised
by
our
physicians
and
what
is
its
nature
ah
that
neither
i
nor
any
other
physician
can
tell
you
life
out
like
a
lamp
when
the
materials
supplying
the
electric
current
are
exhausted
and
yet
here
all
the
waste
of
which
physic
can

chapter
vii
escort
duty
immediately
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
my
host
invited
me
to
the
gate
of
his
garden
where
stood
one
of
the
carriages
i
had
seen
before
in
the
distance
but
never
had
an
opportunity
of
examining
it
rested
on
three
wheels
the
two
hind
ones
by
far
larger
than
that
in
front
which
merely
served
to
sustain
the
equilibrium
of
the
body
and
to
steer
the
material
was
the
metal
of
which
most
martial
vessels
and
furniture
are
formed
every
spar
pole
and
being
a
hollow
cylinder
a
construction
which
with
the
extreme
lightness
of
the
metal
itself
made
the
carriage
far
lighter
than
any
i
had
seen
on
earth
the
body
consisted
of
a
seat
with
sides
back
and
footboard
wide
enough
to
accommodate
two
persons
with
ease
it
was
attached
by
strong
elastic
fastenings
to
a
frame
consisting
of
four
light
poles
rising
from
the
framework
in
which
the
axles
turned
completely
dispensing
with
the
trouble
of
springs
while
affording
a
more
complete
protection
from
anything
like
jolting
the
steering
gear
consisted
of
a
helm
attached
to
the
front
wheel
and
coming
up
within
easy
reach
of
the
driver
hand
the
electric
motive
power
and
machinery
were
concealed
in
a
box
beneath
the
seat
which
was
indeed
but
the
top
of
this
most
important
and
largest
portion
of
the
carriage
the
poles
sustained
a
light
framework
supporting
a
canopy
which
could
be
drawn
over
the
top
and
around
three
sides
of
the
carriage
leaving
only
the
front
open
this
canopy
in
the
present
instance
consisted
of
a
sort
of
very
fine
silken
material
thickly
embroidered
within
and
without
with
feathers
of
various
colours
and
sizes
combined
in
patterns
of
exquisite
beauty
my
host
requested
me
to
mount
the
carriage
with
him
and
drove
for
some
distance
teaching
me
how
to
steer
and
how
by
pressing
a
spring
to
stop
or
slacken
the
motion
of
the
vehicle
also
how
to
direct
it
over
rough
ground
and
up
or
down
the
steepest
slope
on
which
it
was
available
when
we
returned
the
regent
carriage
was
standing
by
the
gate
and
two
others
were
waiting
at
a
little
distance
in
the
rear
the
regent
with
a
companion
was
already
seated
and
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
gate
eveena
appeared
she
was
enveloped
from
head
to
foot
in
a
cloak
of
something
like
covering
her
whole
figure
loose
like
the
ordinary
outer
garments
of
both
sexes
and
gathered
in
at
the
waist
by
a
narrow
zone
of
silver
with
a
sort
of
clasp
of
some
bright
green
jewel
and
a
veil
of
white
material
covered
the
whole
head
and
face
and
fell
to
the
waist
her
gloved
right
hand
was
hidden
by
the
sleeve
of
her
cloak
that
of
the
left
arm
was
turned
back
and
the
hand
which
she
gave
me
as
i
handed
her
to
the
seat
on
my
left
was
bare
a
usage
both
of
convenience
and
courtesy
at
request
the
regent
who
led
the
way
started
at
a
moderate
pace
not
exceeding
some
ten
miles
an
hour
i
observed
that
on
the
roofs
of
all
the
houses
along
the
road
the
inhabitants
had
gathered
to
watch
us
and
as
my
companion
was
so
completely
veiled
i
did
not
baulk
their
curiosity
by
drawing
the
canopy
i
presently
noticed
that
the
girl
held
something
concealed
in
her
right
sleeve
and
ventured
to
ask
her
what
she
had
there
pardon
me
she
said
if
we
had
been
less
hurried
i
meant
to
have
asked
your
permission
to
bring
my
pet
with
me
drawing
back
her
sleeve
she
showed
a
bird
about
the
size
of
a
but
with
an
even
larger
and
stronger
beak
white
body
and
wings
and
tail
like
some
of
the
plumage
of
the
head
and
neck
tinted
with
gold
and
green
around
its
neck
was
a
little
string
of
silver
and
suspended
from
this
a
small
tablet
with
a
pencil
or
style
since
by
her
look
and
manner
she
seemed
to
expect
an
answer
i
said
i
am
very
glad
you
have
given
me
the
opportunity
of
making
acquaintance
with
another
of
those
curiously
tame
and
manageable
animals
which
your
people
seem
to
train
to
such
wonderful
intelligence
and
obedience
we
have
birds
on
earth
which
will
carry
a
letter
from
a
strange
place
to
their
home
but
only
homewards
these
she
answered
will
go
wherever
they
are
directed
if
they
have
been
there
before
and
know
the
name
of
the
place
and
if
this
bird
had
been
let
loose
after
we
had
left
he
would
have
found
me
if
not
hidden
by
trees
or
other
shelter
anywhere
within
a
score
of
miles
and
have
your
people
i
asked
many
more
such
wonderfully
intelligent
and
useful
creatures
tamed
to
your
service
besides
the
ambau
the
tyree
and
these
oh
yes
she
answered
nearly
all
our
domestic
animals
will
do
anything
they
are
told
which
lies
within
their
power
you
have
seen
the
tyree
marching
in
a
line
across
a
field
to
pick
up
every
single
worm
or
insect
or
egg
of
such
within
the
whole
space
over
which
they
move
and
i
think
you
saw
the
ambau
gathering
fruit
it
is
not
very
usual
to
employ
the
latter
for
this
purpose
except
in
the
trees
have
you
not
seen
a
big
creature
i
should
call
it
a
bird
but
a
bird
that
can
not
fly
and
is
covered
with
coarse
hair
instead
of
feathers
it
is
about
as
tall
as
myself
but
with
a
neck
half
as
long
as
its
body
and
a
very
sharp
powerful
beak
and
four
of
these
would
clear
a
field
the
size
of
our
garden
some
acres
of
weeds
in
a
couple
of
days
we
can
send
them
moreover
with
orders
to
fetch
a
certain
number
of
any
particular
fruit
or
plant
and
they
scarcely
ever
forget
or
blunder
some
of
them
of
course
are
cleverer
than
others
the
cleverest
will
remember
the
name
of
every
plant
in
the
garden
and
will
perhaps
bring
four
or
even
six
different
kinds
at
a
time
but
generally
we
show
them
a
leaf
of
the
plant
we
want
or
point
out
to
them
the
bed
where
it
is
to
be
found
and
do
not
trouble
their
memory
with
more
than
two
different
orders
at
a
time
the
unicorns
as
you
call
them
come
regularly
to
be
milked
at
sunset
and
if
told
beforehand
will
come
an
hour
earlier
or
later
to
any
place
pointed
out
to
them
there
were
many
beasts
of
burden
before
the
electric
carriages
were
invented
so
intelligent
that
i
have
heard
the
rider
never
troubled
himself
to
guide
them
except
when
he
changed
his
purpose
or
came
to
a
road
they
had
not
traversed
before
he
would
simply
tell
them
where
to
go
and
they
would
carry
him
safely
the
only
creature
now
kept
for
this
purpose
is
the
largest
of
our
birds
the
about
six
feet
long
from
head
to
tail
and
with
wings
measuring
thrice
as
much
from
tip
to
tip
they
will
sail
through
the
air
and
carry
their
rider
up
to
places
otherwise
inaccessible
but
they
are
little
used
except
by
the
hunters
partly
because
the
danger
is
thought
too
great
partly
because
they
can
not
rise
more
than
about
feet
from
the
with
a
rider
and
within
that
height
there
are
few
places
worth
reaching
that
can
not
be
reached
more
safely
people
used
to
harness
them
to
balloons
till
we
found
means
to
drive
these
by
electricity
the
last
great
invention
in
the
way
of
locomotion
which
i
think
was
completed
within
my
memory
and
i
asked
have
you
no
animals
employed
in
actually
cultivating
the
soil
no
she
replied
except
the
weeding
birds
of
whom
i
have
told
you
when
we
have
a
piece
of
ground
too
small
for
our
electric
ploughs
we
sometimes
set
them
to
break
it
up
and
they
certainly
reduce
the
soil
to
a
powder
much
finer
than
that
produced
by
the
machine
i
should
like
to
see
those
machines
at
work
well
answered
eveena
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
pass
more
than
one
of
them
on
our
way
as
she
said
this
we
reached
the
great
road
i
had
crossed
on
my
arrival
and
turning
up
this
for
a
short
distance
sufficient
however
to
let
me
perceive
that
it
led
to
the
seaport
town
of
which
i
have
spoken
we
came
to
a
break
in
the
central
footpath
just
wide
enough
to
allow
us
to
pass
looking
back
on
this
occasion
i
observed
that
we
were
followed
by
the
two
other
carriages
i
have
mentioned
but
at
some
distance
we
then
proceeded
up
the
mountain
by
a
narrow
road
i
had
not
seen
in
descending
it
on
either
side
of
this
lay
fields
of
the
kind
already
described
one
of
which
was
in
course
of
cultivation
and
here
i
saw
the
ploughs
of
which
my
companion
had
spoken
evidently
constructed
on
the
same
principle
as
the
carriages
but
of
much
greater
size
and
with
heavier
and
broader
wheels
they
tore
up
and
broke
to
pieces
a
breadth
of
soil
of
some
two
yards
working
to
a
depth
of
some
eighteen
inches
with
a
dozen
sharp
powerful
triangular
shares
and
proceeding
at
a
rate
of
about
fifty
yards
per
minute
eveena
explained
that
these
fields
were
generally
from
to
yards
square
the
machine
having
traversed
the
whole
field
in
one
direction
then
recommenced
its
work
ploughing
at
right
angles
to
the
former
and
carrying
behind
it
a
sort
of
harrow
consisting
of
hooks
supported
by
light
hollow
metallic
poles
fixed
at
a
certain
angle
to
the
bar
forming
the
rearward
extremity
of
the
plough
by
which
the
surface
was
levelled
and
the
soil
beaten
into
small
fragments
broken
up
in
fact
as
i
had
seen
not
less
completely
than
ordinary
garden
soil
in
england
or
flanders
when
it
reached
the
end
of
its
course
the
plough
had
to
be
turned
and
this
duty
required
the
employment
of
two
men
one
at
each
end
of
the
field
who
however
had
no
other
or
more
difficult
labour
than
that
of
turning
the
machine
at
the
completion
of
each
set
of
furrows
in
another
field
already
doubly
ploughed
a
sowing
machine
was
at
work
the
large
seeds
were
placed
singly
by
means
of
an
instrument
resembling
a
magnified
ovipositor
such
as
that
possessed
by
many
insects
which
at
regulated
intervals
made
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
deposited
a
seed
therein
eveena
explained
that
where
the
seed
and
plant
were
small
a
continuous
stream
was
poured
into
a
small
furrow
made
by
a
different
instrument
attached
to
the
same
machine
while
another
arm
placed
a
little
to
the
rear
covered
in
the
furrow
and
smoothed
the
surface
in
reply
to
another
question
of
mine
there
are
she
said
some
score
of
different
wool
or
hair
bearing
animals
which
are
shorn
twice
in
the
year
immediately
after
the
rains
and
furnish
the
fibre
which
is
woven
into
most
of
the
materials
we
use
for
dress
and
other
household
purposes
these
creatures
adapt
themselves
to
the
shearing
machines
with
wonderful
equanimity
and
willingness
so
that
they
are
seldom
or
never
injured
not
even
i
asked
by
inexperienced
or
clumsy
hands
hands
she
said
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
they
have
only
to
send
the
animal
into
the
machine
and
indeed
each
goes
in
of
his
own
accord
as
he
sees
his
fellow
come
out
and
have
you
no
vegetable
fibres
i
said
that
are
used
for
weaving
oh
yes
she
answered
several
the
outer
dress
i
wear
indoors
is
made
of
a
fibre
found
inside
the
rind
of
the
fruit
of
the
algyro
tree
and
the
stalks
of
three
or
four
different
kinds
of
plants
afford
materials
almost
equally
soft
and
fine
and
your
cloak
i
asked
is
not
that
made
of
the
skin
of
some
animal
yes
she
replied
and
the
most
curious
creature
i
have
heard
of
it
is
found
only
in
the
northern
and
southern
arctic
to
which
indeed
nearly
all
wild
animals
except
the
few
small
ones
that
are
encouraged
because
they
prey
upon
large
and
noxious
insects
are
now
confined
it
is
about
as
large
as
the
unicorns
and
has
like
them
four
limbs
but
otherwise
it
more
resembles
a
bird
it
has
a
long
slight
neck
but
a
very
small
and
not
very
head
with
a
long
horny
snout
furnished
with
teeth
something
between
a
beak
and
a
mouth
its
hind
limbs
are
those
of
a
bird
except
that
they
have
more
flesh
upon
the
lowest
joints
and
are
covered
with
this
soft
down
its
front
limbs
my
father
says
seem
as
if
nature
had
hesitated
between
wings
and
arms
they
have
attached
to
them
several
long
sharp
featherless
quills
starting
from
a
shrivelled
membrane
which
make
them
very
powerful
and
formidable
weapons
so
that
no
animal
likes
to
attack
it
while
the
foot
has
four
fingers
or
claws
with
which
it
clasps
fish
or
small
dragons
especially
those
electric
dragons
of
which
you
have
seen
a
tame
and
very
much
enlarged
specimen
and
so
holds
them
that
they
can
not
find
a
chance
of
delivering
their
electric
shock
but
for
the
these
dragons
winged
as
they
are
would
make
those
lands
hardly
habitable
either
for
man
or
other
beasts
all
our
furs
are
obtained
from
those
countries
and
the
creatures
from
which
they
are
derived
are
carefully
preserved
for
that
purpose
it
being
forbidden
to
kill
more
than
a
certain
number
of
each
every
year
which
makes
these
skins
by
far
the
costliest
articles
we
use
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
utmost
point
to
which
the
carriages
could
take
us
about
a
furlong
from
the
platform
on
which
i
had
rested
during
my
descent
seeing
that
the
regent
and
his
companion
had
dismounted
i
stopped
and
sprang
down
from
my
carriage
holding
out
my
hand
to
assist
eveena
descent
an
attention
which
i
thought
seemed
to
surprise
her
up
to
the
platform
the
path
was
easy
enough
after
that
it
became
steep
even
for
me
and
certainly
a
troublesome
and
difficult
ascent
for
a
lady
dressed
as
i
have
described
and
hardly
stronger
than
a
child
of
the
same
height
and
size
on
earth
still
my
companion
did
not
seem
to
expect
and
certainly
did
not
invite
assistance
that
she
found
no
little
difficulty
in
the
walk
was
evident
from
her
turning
back
both
sleeves
and
releasing
her
bird
which
hovered
closely
round
her
very
soon
her
embarrassments
and
stumbles
threatened
such
actual
danger
as
overcame
my
fear
of
committing
what
for
aught
i
knew
might
be
an
intrusion
catching
her
as
she
fell
and
raising
her
by
the
left
hand
i
held
it
fast
in
my
own
right
begging
to
be
permitted
to
assist
her
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
her
manner
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
made
it
evident
that
such
an
attention
if
unusual
was
not
offensive
but
i
observed
that
those
who
were
following
us
looked
at
us
with
some
little
surprise
and
spoke
together
in
words
which
i
could
not
catch
but
the
tone
of
which
was
not
exactly
pleasant
or
complimentary
the
regent
a
few
steps
in
advance
of
us
turned
back
from
time
to
time
to
ask
me
some
trivial
question
at
last
we
reached
the
summit
and
here
i
released
my
companion
hand
and
stepped
forward
a
pace
or
two
to
point
out
to
the
regent
the
external
structure
of
the
astronaut
i
was
near
enough
of
course
to
be
heard
by
eveena
and
endeavoured
to
address
my
explanations
as
much
to
her
as
to
the
authority
to
whom
i
was
required
to
render
an
account
but
from
the
moment
that
we
had
actually
joined
him
she
withdrew
from
all
part
and
all
apparent
interest
in
the
conversation
when
our
companions
moved
forward
to
reach
the
entrance
which
i
had
indicated
i
again
offered
my
hand
saying
i
am
afraid
you
will
find
some
little
difficulty
in
getting
into
the
vessel
by
the
window
by
which
i
got
out
the
regent
however
had
brought
with
him
several
light
metal
poles
which
i
had
not
observed
while
carried
by
his
companion
but
which
being
put
together
formed
a
convenient
ladder
of
adequate
length
he
desired
me
to
ascend
first
and
cut
the
riband
by
means
of
which
the
window
had
been
sealed
the
law
being
so
strict
that
even
he
would
not
violate
the
symbol
of
private
ownership
which
protected
my
vessel
having
done
this
and
opened
the
window
i
sprang
down
and
he
followed
by
his
companion
ascended
the
ladder
and
resting
himself
upon
the
broad
inner
ledge
of
the
window
which
afforded
a
convenient
seat
since
the
crystal
was
but
half
the
thickness
of
the
wall
first
took
a
long
look
all
round
the
interior
and
then
leaped
down
followed
by
his
attendant
eveena
drew
back
but
was
at
last
persuaded
to
mount
the
ladder
with
my
assistance
and
rest
on
the
sill
till
i
followed
her
and
lifted
her
down
inside
the
regent
had
by
this
time
reached
the
machinery
and
was
examining
it
very
curiously
with
greater
apparent
appreciation
of
its
purpose
than
i
should
have
expected
when
we
joined
them
i
found
little
difficulty
in
explaining
the
purpose
and
working
of
most
parts
of
the
apparatus
the
nature
and
generation
of
the
apergic
power
i
took
care
not
to
explain
the
existence
of
such
a
repulsive
force
was
the
point
on
which
the
regent
professed
incredulity
as
it
was
of
course
the
critical
fact
on
which
my
whole
narrative
turned
on
which
its
truth
or
falsehood
depended
i
resolved
ere
the
close
of
the
inspection
to
give
him
clear
practical
evidence
on
this
score
in
the
meantime
listening
without
answer
to
his
expressions
of
doubt
i
followed
him
round
the
interior
explaining
to
him
and
to
eveena
the
use
and
structure
of
the
thermometer
barycrite
and
other
instruments
my
fair
companion
seemed
to
follow
my
explanation
almost
as
easily
as
the
officials
our
followers
who
had
now
entered
the
vessel
kept
within
hearing
of
my
remarks
but
evidently
aware
that
they
were
there
on
sufferance
asked
no
questions
and
made
their
comments
in
a
tone
too
low
to
allow
me
to
understand
their
purport
the
impression
made
on
the
regent
by
the
instruments
so
far
as
i
could
gather
from
his
brief
remarks
and
the
expression
of
his
face
was
one
of
contemptuous
surprise
rather
than
the
interest
excited
by
the
motive
machinery
most
of
them
were
evidently
in
his
opinion
clumsy
contrivances
for
obtaining
results
which
the
scientific
knowledge
and
inventive
genius
of
his
countrymen
had
long
ago
secured
more
completely
and
more
easily
but
he
was
puzzled
by
the
combination
of
such
imperfect
knowledge
or
ignorance
with
the
possession
of
a
secret
of
such
immense
importance
as
the
repulsive
current
not
yet
known
nor
as
i
gathered
even
conceived
by
the
inhabitants
of
this
planet
when
he
had
completed
his
inspection
he
requested
permission
to
remove
some
of
the
objects
i
had
left
there
notably
many
of
the
dead
plants
and
several
books
of
drawings
mathematical
mechanical
and
ornamental
which
i
had
left
and
which
had
not
been
brought
away
by
my
host
son
when
he
visited
the
vessel
these
i
begged
him
to
present
to
the
camptâ
adding
to
them
a
few
smaller
curiosities
after
which
i
drew
him
back
towards
the
machinery
he
summoned
his
attendant
and
bade
him
take
away
to
the
carriages
the
articles
i
had
given
him
calling
upon
the
intruders
to
assist
i
was
thus
left
with
him
and
with
eveena
alone
in
the
building
and
with
a
partly
serious
partly
mischievous
desire
to
prove
to
him
the
substantial
reality
of
objects
so
closely
related
to
my
own
disputed
existence
and
to
demonstrate
the
truth
of
my
story
i
loosened
one
of
the
conductors
connected
it
with
the
machinery
and
directing
it
against
him
sent
through
it
a
very
slight
apergic
current
i
was
not
quite
prepared
for
the
result
his
highness
was
instantly
knocked
head
over
heels
to
a
considerable
distance
turning
to
interrupt
the
current
before
going
to
his
assistance
i
was
startled
to
perceive
that
an
accident
of
graver
moment
in
my
estimation
at
least
than
the
discomfiture
of
this
exalted
official
had
resulted
from
my
experiment
i
had
not
noticed
that
a
conductive
wire
was
accidentally
in
contact
with
the
apergion
while
its
end
hung
down
towards
the
floor
of
this
i
suppose
eveena
had
carelessly
taken
hold
and
a
part
of
the
current
passing
through
it
had
lessened
the
shock
to
the
regent
at
the
expense
of
one
which
though
it
could
not
possibly
have
injured
her
had
from
its
suddenness
so
shaken
her
nerves
as
to
throw
her
into
a
momentary
swoon
she
was
recovering
almost
at
soon
as
i
reached
her
and
by
the
time
her
had
picked
himself
up
in
great
disgust
and
astonishment
was
partly
aware
what
had
happened
she
was
however
much
more
anxious
to
excuse
herself
in
the
manner
of
a
frightened
child
for
meddling
with
the
machinery
than
to
hear
my
apologies
for
the
accident
noting
her
agitation
and
seeing
that
she
was
still
trembling
all
over
i
was
more
anxious
to
get
her
into
the
open
air
and
out
of
reach
of
the
apparatus
she
seemed
to
regard
with
considerable
alarm
than
to
offer
any
due
apology
to
the
exalted
personage
to
whom
i
had
afforded
much
stronger
evidence
if
not
of
my
own
substantiality
yet
of
the
real
existence
of
a
repulsive
energy
than
i
had
seriously
intended
with
a
few
hurried
words
to
him
i
raised
eveena
to
the
window
and
lifted
her
to
the
ground
outside
i
felt
however
that
i
could
not
leave
the
regent
to
find
his
own
way
out
the
more
so
that
i
hardly
saw
how
he
could
reach
the
window
from
the
inside
without
my
assistance
i
excused
myself
therefore
and
seating
her
on
a
rock
close
to
the
ladder
promised
to
return
at
once
this
however
i
found
impossible
by
the
time
the
injured
officer
had
recovered
the
physical
shock
to
his
nerves
and
the
moral
effect
of
the
disrespect
to
his
person
his
anxiety
to
verify
what
he
had
heard
entirely
occupied
his
mind
and
he
requested
further
experiments
not
upon
himself
which
occupied
some
he
listened
and
spoke
i
must
admit
with
temper
but
his
air
of
displeasure
was
evident
enough
and
i
was
aware
that
i
had
not
entitled
myself
to
his
good
word
whether
or
not
he
would
permit
his
resentment
to
colour
his
account
of
facts
he
was
compelled
however
to
request
my
help
in
reaching
the
window
which
i
gave
with
all
possible
deference
but
to
my
alarm
when
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
ladder
eveena
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
calling
her
and
receiving
no
reply
calling
again
and
hearing
what
sounded
like
her
voice
but
in
a
faint
tone
and
coming
i
knew
not
whither
i
ran
round
the
platform
to
seek
her
i
could
see
nothing
of
her
but
at
one
point
just
where
the
projecting
edge
of
the
platform
overhung
the
precipice
below
i
recognised
her
bird
fluttering
its
wings
and
screaming
as
if
in
pain
or
terror
the
regent
was
calling
me
in
a
somewhat
imperious
tone
but
of
course
received
neither
answer
nor
attention
reaching
the
spot
i
looked
over
the
edge
and
with
some
trouble
discovered
what
had
happened
not
merely
below
but
underneath
the
overhanging
edge
was
a
shelf
about
four
feet
long
and
some
ten
inches
in
breadth
covered
with
a
flower
equally
remarkable
in
form
and
colour
the
former
being
that
of
a
hollow
cylindrical
bell
about
two
inches
in
diameter
the
latter
a
bluish
lilac
the
nearest
approach
to
azure
i
have
seen
in
mars
the
whole
ground
one
sheet
of
flowers
on
this
holding
in
a
state
to
the
rock
above
her
eveena
clung
her
veil
and
fallen
her
face
expressing
utter
bewilderment
as
well
as
terror
i
saw
though
at
the
moment
i
hardly
understood
how
she
had
reached
this
point
a
very
narrow
path
some
hundred
feet
in
length
sloped
down
from
the
of
the
summit
to
the
shelf
on
which
she
stood
with
an
outer
hedge
of
shrubs
and
the
summits
of
small
trees
which
concealed
and
in
some
sort
guarded
the
precipice
below
so
that
even
a
timid
girl
might
pursue
the
path
without
fear
but
this
path
ended
several
feet
from
the
commencement
of
the
shelf
across
the
gap
had
lain
a
fallen
tree
with
boughs
affording
such
a
screen
and
railing
on
the
outward
side
as
might
at
once
conceal
the
gulf
below
and
afford
assistance
in
crossing
the
chasm
but
in
crossing
this
tree
eveena
footsteps
had
displaced
it
and
it
had
so
given
way
as
not
only
to
be
unavailable
but
a
serious
obstacle
to
my
passage
had
i
had
time
to
go
round
i
might
have
been
able
to
leap
the
chasm
i
certainly
could
not
return
that
way
with
a
burden
even
so
light
as
that
of
my
precious
charge
the
only
chance
was
to
lift
her
by
main
force
directly
to
where
i
stood
and
the
outward
projection
of
the
rock
at
this
point
rendered
this
peculiarly
difficult
as
i
had
nothing
to
cling
or
hold
by
the
regent
had
by
this
time
reached
me
and
discerned
what
had
occurred
hold
me
fast
i
said
or
sit
upon
me
if
you
like
to
hold
me
with
your
weight
whilst
i
lean
over
the
man
stood
astounded
not
by
the
danger
of
another
but
by
the
demand
on
himself
and
evidently
without
the
slightest
intention
of
complying
you
are
mad
he
said
your
chance
is
ten
times
greater
to
lose
your
own
life
than
to
save
hers
lose
my
life
i
cried
could
i
dare
return
alive
without
her
throw
your
whole
weight
on
me
i
say
as
i
lean
over
and
waste
no
more
time
what
he
rejoined
you
are
twice
as
heavy
as
i
and
if
you
are
pulled
over
i
shall
probably
go
over
too
why
am
i
to
endanger
myself
to
save
a
girl
from
the
consequences
of
her
folly
if
you
do
not
i
swore
i
will
fling
you
where
the
carcass
of
which
you
are
so
careful
shall
be
crushed
out
of
the
very
form
of
the
manhood
you
disgrace
even
this
threat
failed
to
move
him
meantime
the
bird
fluttering
on
my
shoulder
suggested
a
last
chance
and
snatching
the
tablet
round
its
neck
i
wrote
two
words
thereon
and
calling
to
it
home
the
intelligent
creature
flew
off
at
fullest
speed
now
i
said
if
you
do
not
help
me
i
will
kill
you
here
and
now
if
you
pretend
to
help
and
fail
me
that
bird
carries
to
esmo
my
request
to
hold
you
answerable
for
our
lives
i
invoked
in
utter
desperation
the
awe
with
which
as
his
hints
and
my
experience
implied
esmo
was
regarded
by
his
neighbours
and
slender
as
seemed
this
support
it
did
not
fail
me
the
countenance
fell
and
i
saw
that
i
might
depend
at
least
on
his
passive
compliance
clasping
his
arm
with
my
left
hand
i
said
pull
back
with
all
your
might
if
i
go
over
you
go
over
too
then
pulling
him
down
with
me
and
stretching
myself
over
the
precipice
so
far
that
but
for
this
additional
support
i
must
have
fallen
i
reached
eveena
whose
closed
eyes
and
relaxing
limbs
indicated
that
another
moment
delay
might
be
fatal
give
me
your
hand
i
cried
in
despair
seeing
how
tightly
she
still
grasped
the
tough
fibrous
shoots
growing
in
the
crevices
of
the
rock
whereof
she
had
taken
hold
give
me
your
hand
and
let
go
to
give
me
her
hand
was
beyond
the
power
of
her
will
to
let
go
without
giving
me
hold
would
have
been
fatal
beaching
over
to
the
uttermost
i
contrived
to
lay
a
firm
grasp
upon
her
wrist
but
this
would
not
do
i
could
hardly
drag
her
up
by
one
arm
especially
if
she
would
not
relax
her
grasp
i
must
release
the
regent
and
depend
upon
his
obedience
or
forfeit
the
chance
of
saving
her
as
in
a
few
more
moments
she
would
certainly
swoon
and
fall
throw
yourself
upon
me
and
sit
firm
if
you
value
your
life
i
cried
and
i
relaxed
my
hold
on
his
arm
stretching
both
hands
to
grasp
eveena
i
felt
the
man
weight
on
my
body
and
with
both
arms
extended
to
the
uttermost
hanging
over
the
edge
i
caught
firm
bold
of
the
girl
shoulders
even
now
with
any
girl
of
her
age
on
earth
and
for
aught
i
know
with
many
martial
damsels
the
case
would
have
been
hopeless
my
whole
strength
was
required
to
raise
her
i
had
none
to
spare
to
force
her
loose
from
her
hold
fortunately
my
rough
and
tight
clasp
seemed
to
rouse
her
her
eyes
half
opened
and
appeared
to
have
returned
let
go
i
cried
in
that
sharp
tone
of
imperious
anger
which
with
some
tempers
at
least
is
the
natural
expression
of
the
outward
impulse
produced
by
supreme
and
agonizing
terror
obedience
is
the
hereditary
lesson
taught
to
her
sex
by
the
effects
of
equality
in
mars
eveena
had
been
personally
trained
in
a
principle
long
discarded
by
terrestrial
women
and
not
half
aware
what
she
did
but
yielding
instinctively
to
the
habit
of
compliance
with
imperative
command
spoken
in
a
masculine
voice
she
opened
her
hands
just
as
i
had
lost
all
hope
with
one
desperate
effort
i
swung
her
fairly
on
to
the
platform
and
seeing
her
safe
there
fell
back
myself
scarcely
more
sensible
than
she
was
the
whole
of
this
terrible
scene
which
it
has
taken
so
long
to
relate
did
not
occupy
more
than
a
minute
in
action
i
know
not
whether
my
readers
can
understand
the
full
difficulty
and
danger
of
the
situation
i
know
that
no
words
of
mine
can
convey
the
impression
graven
into
my
own
memory
never
to
be
effaced
or
weakened
while
consciousness
remains
the
strongest
man
on
earth
could
not
have
done
what
i
did
could
not
lying
half
over
the
precipice
have
swung
a
girl
of
eighteen
right
out
from
underneath
him
and
to
his
own
level
but
eveena
was
of
slighter
smaller
frame
than
a
healthy
french
girl
of
twelve
while
i
retained
the
full
strength
of
a
man
adapted
to
the
work
of
a
world
where
every
weight
is
twice
as
heavy
as
on
mars
what
i
had
practically
to
do
was
to
lift
not
seven
or
eight
stone
of
european
girlhood
not
even
the
six
eveena
might
possibly
have
weighed
on
earth
but
half
that
weight
and
yet
the
position
was
such
that
all
the
strength
i
had
acquired
through
ten
years
of
constant
practice
in
the

in

of
a
frame
in
healthful
maturity
and
of
muscles
whose
force
seemed
doubled
by
the
tension
of
the
nerves
hardly
availed
when
i
recovered
my
own
senses
and
had
contrived
to
restore
eveena
my
unwilling
assistant
had
disappeared
it
was
an
hour
before
eveena
seemed
in
a
condition
to
be
removed
and
perhaps
i
was
not
very
urgent
to
hurry
her
away
i
had
done
no
more
than
any
man
the
lowest
and
meanest
on
earth
must
have
done
under
the
circumstances
i
can
scarcely
enter
into
the
feelings
of
the
who
in
my
position
could
have
recognised
a
choice
but
between
saving
and
perishing
with
the
helpless
creature
entrusted
to
his
charge

hereditary
disbelief
in
any
power
above
the
physical
forces
of
nature
in
any
law
higher
than
that
of
man
own
making
has
rendered

in
mars
something
utterly
different
from
perhaps
hardly
intelligible
to
the
human
nature
of
a
planet
forty
million
miles
nearer

sun
though
brought
up
in
an
affectionate
home
eveena
shared
the
ideas
of
the
world
in
which
she
was
born
and
so
far
accepted
its
standards
of
opinion
and
action
as
natural
if
not
right
that
the
risk
i
had
run
the
effort
i
had
made
to
save
her
seemed
to
her
scarcely
less
extraordinary
than
it
had
appeared
to
the
zamptâ
she
rated
its
devotion
and
generosity
as
highly
as
he
appreciated
its
extravagance
and
folly
and
if
he
counted
me
a
madman

was

to

hero

the
tones
and
looks
of
a
maiden
in
such
a
temper

perfect
her
maidenly
reserve
would
i
fancy
be
very
agreeable
to
men
older
than
i
was
either
in
constitution
or
even
in
experience
i
doubt
whether
any
man
under
fifty
would
have
been
more
anxious
than
myself
to
cut
short
our
period
of
repose
broken
as
it
was
when
i
refused
to
listen
to
her
tearful
penitence
and
by
occasional
words
and
looks
of
gratitude
and
admiration
i
did
however
remember
that
it
was
expedient
to
refasten
the
window
and
the
seals
before
departing
at
the
end
of
the
hour
rest
i
allowed
my
charge
and
myself
i
had
recovered
more
or
less
completely
the
nervous
force
which
had
been
for
a
while
utterly
exhausted
less
by
the
effort
than
by
the
terror
that
preceded
it
i
was
neither
surprised
nor
perhaps
as
much
grieved
as
i
should
have
been
to
find
that
eveena
could
hardly
walk
and
felt
to
the
full
the
value
of
those
novel
conditions
which
enabled
me
to
carry
her
the
more
easily
in
my
arms
though
much
oppressed
even
by
so
slight
an
effort
in
that
thin
air
to
the
place
where
we
had
left
our
carriage
no
inconsiderable
distance
by
the
path
we
had
to
pursue
before
starting
on
our
return
i
had
in
despite
of
her
most
earnest
entreaties
managed
to
recover
her
and
veil
at
a
risk
which
under
other
circumstances
i
might
not
have
cared
to
encounter
but
had
she
been
seen
without
it
on
our
return
the
comments
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
would
have
been
such
as
might
have
disturbed
even
her
father
cool
indifference
we
reached
her
home
in
safety
and
with
little
notice
having
of
course
drawn
the
canopy
around
us
as
completely
as
possible
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
only
her
younger
sister
to
whose
care
i
at
once
committed
her
was
there
at
present
the
elders
not
having
yet
returned

took
care
to
detach
from
the

the
tablet
which
had
served
its
purpose
so
well
the
creature
had
found
his
way
home
within
after
i
dismissed
him
and
had
frightened
zevle

a
little

the
message
which
a

would
have
made
sufficiently

utterly
escaped

chapter
viii
a
faith
and
its
founder
on
the
return
of
the
family
my
host
was
met
at
the
door
with
such
accounts
of
what
had
happened
as
led
him
at
once
to
see
and
question
his
daughter
it
was
not
therefore
till
he
had
heard
her
story
that
i
saw
him
more
agitated
than
i
should
have
expected
from
one
under
ordinary
circumstances
so
calm
and
he
entered
my
room
with
a
face
whose
paleness
and
compressed
lips
indicated
intense
emotion
and
laying
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
expressed
his
feeling
rather
in
look
and
tone
than
in
his
few
broken
and
not
very
significant
words
after
a
few
moments
however
he
recovered
his
coolness
and
asked
me
to
supply
the
deficiencies
of
eveena
story
i
told
him
briefly
but
exactly
what
had
passed
from
the
moment
when
i
missed
her
to
that
of
her
rescue
he
listened
without
the
slightest
symptom
of
surprise
or
anger
to
the
tale
of
the
regent
indifference
and
seemed
hardly
to
understand
the
disgust
and
indignation
with
which
i
dwelt
upon
it
when
i
had
finished
you
have
made
he
said
an
enemy
and
a
dangerous
one
but
you
have
also
secured
friends
against
whose
support
even
the
anger
of
a
greater
than
the
zamptâ
might
break
as
harmlessly
as
waves
upon
a
rock
he
behaved
only
as
any
one
else
would
have
done
and
it
is
useless
to
be
angry
with
men
for
being
what
they
habitually
and
universally
are
what
you
did
for
eveena
one
of
ourselves
perhaps
but
no
other
might
have
risked
for
a
first
bride
on
the
first
day
of
her
marriage
indeed
though
i
am
most
thankful
to
you
i
should
perhaps
have
withheld
my
consent
to
my
daughter
request
had
i
supposed
that
you
felt
so
strongly
for
her
i
think
i
replied
with
some
displeasure
that
i
may
positively
affirm
that
i
have
spoken
no
word
to
your
daughter
which
i
should
not
have
spoken
in
your
presence
i
am
too
unfamiliar
with
your
ideas
to
know
whether
your
remark
has
the
same
force
and
meaning
it
would
have
borne
among
my
own
people
but
to
me
it
conveys
a
grave
reproach
when
i
accepted
the
charge
of
your
daughter
during
this
day
excursion
i
thought
of
her
only
as
every
man
thinks
of
a
young
pretty
and
gentle
girl
of
whom
he
has
seen
and
knows
scarcely
anything
to
avail
myself
of
what
has
since
happened
to
make
a
deeper
impression
on
her
feelings
than
you
might
approve
would
have
seemed
to
me
unpardonable
treachery
you
do
utterly
misunderstand
me
he
answered
it
may
be
that
eveena
has
received
an
impression
which
will
not
be
effaced
from
her
mind
it
may
be
that
this
morning
could
i
have
foreseen
it
i
should
have
decidedly
wished
to
avoid
anything
that
would
so
impress
her
but
that
feeling
if
it
exist
has
been
caused
by
your
acts
and
not
by
your
words
that
you
should
do
your
utmost
at
any
risk
to
yourself
to
save
her
is
consistent
with
what
i
know
of
your
habit
of
mind
and
ought
not
much
to
surprise
me
but
from
your
own
account
of
what
you
said
to
the
zamptâ
you
were
not
merely
willing
to
risk
life
for
life
when
you
deemed
it
impossible
to
return
without
her
you
spoke
as
few
among
us
would
seriously
speak
of
a
favourite
bride
i
spoke
and
felt
i
replied
as
any
man
trained
in
the
hereditary
thought
of
my
race
and
rank
would
have
spoken
of
any
woman
committed
to
his
care
all
that
i
said
and
did
for
eveena
i
should
have
said
and
done
i
hope
for
the
least
attractive
or
least
amiable
maiden
in
this
planet
who
had
been
similarly
entrusted
to
my
charge
how
could
any
but
the
vilest
coward
return
and
say
to
a
father
trusted
your
daughter
to
me
and
she
has
perished
by
my
fault
or
neglect
not
so
he
answered
eveena
alone
was
to
blame
and
much
to
blame
she
says
herself
that
you
had
told
her
to
remain
where
you
left
her
till
your
return
and
if
she
had
not
disobeyed
neither
her
life
nor
yours
would
have
been
imperilled
one
hardly
expects
a
young
lady
to
comply
exactly
with
such
requests
i
said
at
any
rate
terrestrial
feelings
of
honour
and
even
of
manhood
would
have
made
it
easier
to
leap
the
precipice
than
to
face
you
and
the
world
if
no
matter
by
whose
fault
my
charge
had
died
in
such
a
manner
under
my
eyes
and
within
my
reach
esmo
eyes
brightened
and
his
cheek
flushed
a
little
as
i
spoke
with
more
of
earnestness
or
passion
than
any
incident
however
exciting
is
wont
to
provoke
among
his
impassive
race
of
one
thing
he
said
you
have
assured
me
that
the
proposal
i
was
about
to
make
rather
invites
honour
than
confers
it
i
have
been
obliged
in
speaking
of
the
manners
and
ideas
of
my
countrymen
to
let
you
perceive
not
only
that
i
differ
from
them
but
that
there
are
others
who
think
and
act
as
i
do
we
have
for
ages
formed
a
society
bound
together
by
our
peculiar
tenets
that
we
individually
differ
in
conduct
and
therefore
probably
in
ideas
from
our
countrymen
they
necessarily
know
that
we
form
a
body
apart
with
laws
and
tenets
of
our
own
is
at
least
suspected
but
our
organisation
its
powers
its
methods
its
rules
of
membership
and
its
doctrines
are
and
have
always
been
a
secret
and
no
man
connection
with
it
is
avowed
or
provable
our
chief
distinctive
and
essential
doctrines
you
hold
as
strongly
as
we
do
the
existence
the
immortal
human
soul
from
these
necessarily
follow
conceptions
of
life
and
principles
of
conduct
alien
to
those
that
have
as
necessarily
grown
up
among
a
race
which
repudiates
ignores
and
hates
our
two
fundamental
premises
after
what
has
happened
i
can
promise
you
immediate
and
eager
acceptance
among
those
invested
with
the
fullest
privileges
of
our
order
they
will
all
admire
your
action
and
applaud
your
motives
though
frankly
speaking
i
doubt
whether
any
of
us
would
carry
your
views
so
far
as
you
have
done
the
best
among
us
would
have
flinched
unless
under
the
influence
of
the
very
strongest
personal
affection
from
the
double
peril
of
which
you
seemed
to
think
so
lightly
they
might
indeed
have
defied
the
regent
but
it
would
have
been
in
reliance
on
the
protection
of
a
power
superior
to
his
of
which
you
knew
nothing
then
i
said
i
suppose
your
engagement
of
was
a
meeting
of
this
society
yes
he
answered
a
meeting
of
the
chamber
to
which
i
and
the
elder
members
of
my
household
including
my
son
and
his
wife
belong
but
i
said
if
you
are
more
powerful
than
the
rulers
of
your
people
what
need
of
such
careful
secrecy
you
will
understand
the
reason
he
answered
when
you
learn
the
nature
of
our
powers
hundreds
among
millions
we
are
no
match
for
the
fighting
force
of
our
unbelieving
countrymen
our
safety
lies
in
the
terror
inspired
by
a
tradition
verified
by
repeated
and
invariable
experience
that
no
one
who
injures
one
of
us
but
has
reason
to
rue
it
that
no
mortal
enemy
of
has
ever
escaped
signal
punishment
more
terrible
for
the
mystery
attending
it
were
we
known
were
our
organisation
avowed
we
might
be
hunted
down
and
exterminated
and
should
certainly
suffer
frightful
havoc
even
if
in
the
end
we
were
able
to
frighten
or
overcome
our
enemies
but
if
you
are
disposed
to
accept
my
offer
and
enrolment
among
us
gives
you
at
once
your
natural
place
in
this
planet
and
your
best
security
against
the
enmity
you
have
incurred
and
will
incur
here
i
should
prefer
to
make
the
rest
of
the
explanation
that
must
precede
your
admission
in
presence
of
my
family
the
first
step
the
preliminary
instruction
in
our
creed
and
our
simpler
mysteries
which
is
the
work
of
the
novitiate
is
a
solemn
epoch
in
the
lives
of
our
children
they
are
not
trusted
with
our
secret
till
we
can
rely
on
the
maturity
of
their
intelligence
and
loyalty
of
their
nature
eveena
would
in
any
case
have
been
received
as
a
novice
within
some
dozen
days
it
will
now
be
easy
for
me
considering
her
education
and
intelligence
and
my
own
position
in
the
order
to
obtain
for
her
as
for
you
exemption
from
the
usual
probation
on
proof
that
you
both
know
all
that
is
usually
taught
therein
and
admission
on
the
same
occasion
and
it
will
add
solemnity
and
interest
to
her
first
initiation
that
this
chief
lesson
of
her
life
should
be
shared
this
evening
with
him
to
whom
she
owes
it
that
she
lives
to
enter
the
society
to
which
her
ancestors
have
belonged
since
its
institution
we
passed
into
the
peristyle
where
the
ladies
were
as
usual
assembled
but
the
children
had
been
dismissed
and
of
the
maidens
eveena
only
was
present
fatigue
and
agitation
had
left
her
very
pale
and
she
was
resting
at
full
length
on
the
cushions
with
her
head
pillowed
on
her
mother
knee
as
we
approached
however
they
all
rose
the
other
ladies
greeting
me
eagerly
and
warmly
eveena
rising
with
difficulty
and
faltering
the
welcome
which
the
rest
had
spoken
with
enthusiastic
earnestness
forgetting
for
the
moment
the
prudence
which
ignorance
of
martial
customs
had
hitherto
dictated
i
lifted
to
my
lips
the
hand
that
she
following
the
example
of
the
rest
but
shyly
and
half
reluctantly
laid
on
my
shoulder
a
form
very
different
to
the
distant
greeting
i
had
heretofore
received
and
marking
that
i
was
no
longer
to
be
treated
as
a
stranger
to
the
family
my
unusual
salute
brought
the
colour
back
to
her
cheeks
but
no
one
else
took
notice
of
it
i
observed
however
that
on
this
occasion
instead
of
interposing
himself
between
me
and
the
ladies
as
usual
her
father
left
vacant
the
place
next
to
her
and
i
seated
myself
at
her
feet
she
would
have
exchanged
her
reclining
posture
for
that
of
the
others
but
her
mother
gently
drew
her
down
to
her
former
position
eveena
said
my
host
i
have
told
our
friend
what
you
know
that
there
is
in
this
world
a
society
of
which
i
am
a
member
whose
principles
are
not
those
of
our
countrymen
but
resemble
rather
those
which
supplied
the
impulses
on
which
he
acted
this
much
you
know
what
you
would
have
learned
a
few
days
hence
i
mean
that
you
and
he
shall
now
hear
at
the
same
time
before
you
enter
on
that
subject
interposed
zulve
timidly
for
it
is
most
unusual
for
a
lady
to
interfere
in
her
husband
conversation
much
more
to
offer
a
suggestion
or
correction
but
yet
earnestly
let
me
say
on
my
own
part
what
i
am
sure
you
must
have
said
already
on
yours
if
there
be
now
or
ever
shall
be
anything
we
can
do
for
our
guest
anything
we
can
give
that
he
would
value
not
in
requital
but
in
memory
of
what
he
has
done
for
us
whatever
it
should
cost
us
though
he
should
ask
the
most
precious
thing
we
possess
it
will
be
our
pride
and
pleasure
the
greatest
pleasure
he
can
afford
us
to
grant
it
the
time
and
the
surroundings
were
not
perhaps
exactly
suitable
to
the
utterance
of
the
wish
suggested
by
these
words
but
i
knew
so
little
what
might
be
in
store
for
me
and
understood
so
well
the
difficulty
and
uncertainty
of
finding
future
opportunities
of
intercourse
with
the
ladies
at
least
of
the
family
that
i
dared
not
lose
the
present
i
spoke
at
once
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
with
a
sense
of
reckless
desperation
not
unlike
that
with
which
an
artillerist
fires
the
train
whose
explosion
may
win
for
him
the
obsidional
wreath
or
blow
him
into
atoms
you
and
my
host
i
said
have
one
treasure
that
i
have
learned
to
covet
but
it
is
exactly
the
most
precious
thing
you
possess
and
one
which
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
ask
as
reward
even
had
i
not
owed
to
esmo
the
life
i
perilled
for
eveena
and
if
i
had
acted
from
choice
and
freely
instead
of
doing
only
what
only
the
vilest
of
cowards
could
have
failed
to
attempt
in
asking
it
indeed
i
feel
that
i
cancel
whatever
claim
your
extravagant
estimate
of
that
act
can
possibly
ascribe
to
me
we
do
waste
words
answered
esmo
in
saying
what
we
do
mean
and
i
confirm
fully
what
my
wife
has
said
there
is
nothing
we
possess
that
we
shall
not
delight
to
give
as
token
of
regard
and
in
remembrance
of
this
day
to
the
saviour
of
our
child
if
i
said
i
find
a
neighbour
purse
containing
half
his
fortune
and
return
it
to
him
he
may
offer
me
what
reward
i
ask
but
would
hardly
think
it
reasonable
if
i
asked
for
the
purse
and
its
contents
but
you
have
only
one
thing
i
care
to
possess
that
which
i
have
by
god
help
been
enabled
to
save
if
i
must
ask
a
gift
give
me
eveena
herself
utilitarianism
has
extinguished
in
mars
the
use
of
compliment
and
circumlocution
and
until
i
concluded
their
looks
of
mild
perplexity
showed
that
neither
zulve
nor
her
husband
caught
my
purpose
i
fancied
for
not
daring
to
look
them
in
the
face
i
had
turned
my
downcast
glance
on
eveena
that
she
had
perhaps
somewhat
sooner
divined
the
object
of
my
thoughts
however
a
silence
of
surprise
was
it
of
reluctance
followed
and
then
zulve
bent
over
her
daughter
and
looked
into
her
face
while
esmo
answered
what
you
should
ask
i
promised
to
give
what
you
have
asked
i
give
in
so
far
as
it
is
mine
to
give
in
willing
fulfilment
of
my
pledge
but
of
course
what
i
can
give
is
but
my
free
permission
to
my
daughter
to
answer
for
herself
you
will
be
i
hope
within
a
few
days
at
furthest
one
of
those
in
whose
possession
alone
a
woman
of
my
house
could
be
safe
or
content
and
free
by
the
law
of
the
land
to
follow
her
own
wish
she
is
freed
by
her
father
voice
from
the
rule
which
the
usage
of
ten
thousand
years
imposes
on
the
daughters
of
our
brotherhood
zulve
then
looked
up
for
eveena
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
robe
and
said
if
my
child
will
not
speak
for
herself
i
must
speak
for
her
and
in
my
own
name
and
in
hers
i
fulfil
her
father
promise
and
now
let
my
husband
tell
his
story
for
nothing
can
solemnise
more
appropriately
the
betrothal
of
a
daughter
of
the
star
than
her
admission
to
the
knowledge
of
the
order
whose
privileges
are
her
heritage
at
the
time
esmo
began
when
material
science
had
gained
a
decided
ascendant
and
enforced
the
recognition
of
its
methods
as
the
only
ones
whereby
certain
knowledge
and
legitimate
belief
could
be
attained
those
who
clung
most
earnestly
to
convictions
not
acquired
or
favoured
by
scientific
logic
were
sorely
dismayed
they
were
confounded
not
so
much
by
the
yet
informal
but
irrevocable
against
them
as
by
an
instinctive
misgiving
that
science
was
right
and
by
irrepressible
doubts
whether
that
which
would
not
bear
the
application
of
scientific
method
could
in
any
sense
be
true
or
trustworthy
knowledge
at
the
same
time
to
apply
a
scientific
method
to
the
cherished
beliefs
threatened
only
to
dissolve
them
fortunately
for
them
and
their
successors
there
was
living
at
that
time
one
of
the
most
remarkable
and
original
thinkers
whom
our
race
has
produced
from
him
came
the
suggestions
that
gave
impulse
to
our
learning
and
birth
to
our
order
reasonings
the
processes
of
science
he
affirmed
beyond
challenge
their
trustworthiness
depends
not
on
their
but
on
their
own
character
not
on
their
relation
to
outward
nature
but
on
their
conformity
to
the
laws
of
thought
their
upholders
are
right
in
affirming
that
what
will
not
ultimately
bear
the
test
of
their
application
can
not
be
knowledge
and
probably
for
the
practical
purposes
of
human
life
we
may
say
certainly
can
not
be
truth
they
are
wrong
in
alleging
that
the
ideas
for
which
they
can
find
no
foundation
in
the
subjects
to
which
scientific
method
has
hitherto
been
applied
are
therefore
unscientific
or
sure
to
disappear
under
scientific
investigation
i
hold
that
the
existence
of
a
creator
and
ruler
of
the
universe
can
be
logically
deduced
from
first
principles
as
well
as
justly
inferred
from
cumulative
evidences
of
overwhelming
weight
the
existence
of
something
in
man
that
is
not
merely
corporeal
of
powers
that
can
act
beyond
the
reach
of
any
corporeal
instruments
at
his
command
or
without
the
range
of
their
application
is
not
proven
it
may
be
only
because
the
facts
that
indicate
without
proving
it
have
never
yet
been
subject
to
systematic
verification
or
scientific
analysis
but
of
such
facts
there
exists
a
vast
accumulation
unsifted
untested
and
therefore
as
yet
ineffective
for
proof
but
capable
i
can
scarcely
doubt
of
reduction
to
methodical
order
and
scientific
treatment
there
are
records
and
traditions
of
every
degree
of
value
from
utter
worthlessness
to
the
worth
of
the
most
authentic
history
preserving
the
evidences
of
powers
which
may
be
generally
described
as
spiritual
through
all
ages
among
all
races
the
living
have
alleged
themselves
from
time
to
time
to
have
seen
the
forms
and
even
heard
the
voices
of
the
dead
scientific
men
have
been
forced
by
the
actual
and
public
exercise
of
the
power
under
the
most
crucial
tests
for
instance
to
produce
insensibility
in
surgical
operations
to
admit
that
the
will
of
one
man
can
control
the
brain
the
senses
the
physical
frame
of
another
without
material
contact
perhaps
at
a
distance
there
are
narratives
of
marvels
wrought
by
human
will
chiefly
in
remote
but
occasionally
in
recent
times
transcending
and
even
contradicting
or
overruling
the
known
laws
of
nature
all
these
evidences
point
to
one
conclusion
all
corroborate
and
confirm
one
another
the
men
of
science
ridicule
them
because
in
so
many
cases
the
facts
are
imperfectly
authenticated
and
because
in
others
the
action
of
the
powers
is
uncertain
dependent
on
conditions
imperfectly
ascertained
and
not
of
that
material
kind
to
which
material
science
willingly
submits
but
if
they
be
facts
if
they
relate
to
any
element
of
human
nature
all
these
things
can
be
systematically
investigated
the
true
separated
from
the
false
the
proven
from
the
unproven
the
powers
can
be
investigated
their
conditions
of
action
laid
down
probably
they
may
be
so
developed
as
to
be
exercised
with
comparative
certainty
whether
by
every
one
or
only
by
those
special
constitutions
in
which
they
may
inhere
such
investigations
will
at
present
only
enlist
the
attention
and
care
of
a
few
qualified
persons
and
that
they
may
be
carried
on
in
peace
and
safety
should
be
carried
on
in
secrecy
but
upon
them
may
i
hope
be
founded
a
certainty
as
regards
the
higher
side
of
man
nature
not
less
complete
than
that
which
science
by
similar
methods
has
gradually
acquired
in
regard
to
its
purely
physical
aspects
for
this
end
he
instituted
a
secret
society
which
has
subsisted
in
constantly
increasing
strength
and
cohesion
to
the
present
hour
it
has
collected
evidence
conducted
experiments
investigated
records
studied
methodically
the
abnormal
phenomena
you
call
occult
or
spiritual
and
reduced
them
to
something
like
the
certainty
of
science
discoveries
from
the
first
curious
and
interesting
have
become
more
and
more
complete
practical
and
effective
our
results
have
surpassed
the
hopes
of
our
founder
and
transcend
in
importance
while
they
equal
in
certainty
the
contemporary
achievements
of
physical
science
some
of
the
chief
of
which
belong
to
us
all
that
profound
knowledge
of
human
nature
could
suggest
to
bring
its
weakness
to
the
support
of
its
strength
and
enlist
both
in
the
work
was
done
by
our
founder
and
by
those
who
have
carried
out
his
scheme
the
corporate
character
of
the
society
its
rites
and
formularies
its
grades
and
ranks
are
matter
of
deep
interest
to
all
its
members
have
linked
them
together
by
an
inviolable
bond
and
given
them
a
strength
infinitely
greater
than
numbers
without
such
cohesion
could
possibly
have
afforded
the
founder
left
us
no
moral
code
imposed
on
us
none
of
his
own
most
cherished
ethical
convictions
as
he
pledged
us
to
none
of
the
conclusions
which
his
own
occult
studies
had
led
him
to
anticipate
nearly
all
of
which
have
been
verified
by
later
investigation
such
rules
as
he
imposed
were
directed
only
to
the
cohesion
and
efficiency
of
the
order
our
creed
still
consists
only
of
the
two
fundamental
doctrines
two
settled
principles
only
are
laid
down
by
our
aboriginal
law
we
are
taught
to
cultivate
the
closest
personal
affection
the
most
intimate
and
binding
ties
among
ourselves
to
defend
the
order
and
one
another
whether
by
strenuous
resistance
or
severe
reprisals
against
all
who
injure
us
individually
or
collectively
and
especially
against
persecutors
of
the
order
but
the
few
laws
our
founder
has
left
are
given
in
the
form
of
striking
precepts
brief
and
often
even
paradoxical
for
example
the
law
of
defence
or
reprisal
is
concentrated
in
one
antithetic
phrase
dax
zveltâ
gavart
gedex
never
let
the
member
strike
never
let
the
order
spare
as
it
is
a
rule
with
us
to
embody
none
of
our
symbols
forms
or
laws
in
writing
this
manner
of
statement
served
to
impress
them
on
the
memory
as
well
as
to
leave
the
utmost
freedom
in
their
application
by
the
gathered
experience
of
ages
and
the
prudence
of
those
who
had
to
deal
with
the
circumstances
of
each
successive
period
another
maxim
says
kisses
a
brother
hand
may
kick
the
camptâ
thus
enforcing
at
once
the
value
of
ceremonial
courtesy
and
the
power
conferred
by
union
we
observe
more
ceremony
in
family
life
than
others
in
the
most
formal
public
relations
their
theory
of
life
being
utterly
utilitarian
no
form
is
observed
that
serves
no
distinct
practical
purpose
we
wish
to
make
life
graceful
and
elegant
as
well
as
easy
principles
originally
inculcated
upon
us
by
the
necessity
of
have
been
enforced
and
graven
on
our
very
nature
by
the
reaction
of
our
experience
against
the
rough
and
harsh
relations
the
jarring
and
often
unfriendly
intercourse
of
external
society
aliens

our
order

the

or
even
the
weaknesses
of
a

punctilious
courtesy
frank
apology
for
unintentional
wrong
is
with
us
a
point
of
honour
disputes
when
by
any
chance
they
arise
are
referred
to
the
arbitration
of
our
chiefs
who
never
consider
their
work

till
the

cordially
reconciled
envy
the
most
dangerous
source
of
among
men
can
hardly
exist
among
us
rank
has
been
well
earned
by
its
holder
or
in
a
few
cases
by
his
ancestors
and
authority
is
a
trust
never
to
be
used
for
its
benefit
wealth
never
provokes
covetousness
since
no
member
is
ever
allowed
to
be
poor
not
only
the
order
but
each
member
is
bound
to
take
every
opportunity
of
assisting
every
other
by
every
method
within
his
power
we
employ
them
we
promote
them
we
give
them
the
preference
in
every
kind
of
patronage
at
our
command
but
these
obligations
are
points
of
honour
rather
than
of
law
only
apostasy
or
treason
to
the
order
involve
compulsory
penalties
and
the
latter
if
it
ever
occurred
in
these
days
would
be
visited
with
instant
death
inflicted
as
it
is
inflicted
upon
irreconcilable
enemies
in
such
a
manner
that
none
could
know
who
passed
the
sentence
or
by
whom
it
was
executed
and
have
you
i
asked
no
apostates
as
you
have
no
traitors
no
he
said
in
the
first
place
none
who
has
lived
among
us
could
endure
to
fall
into
the
ordinary
martial
life
secondly
the
foundations
of
our
simple
creed
are
so
clear
so
capable
of
being
made
apparent
to
every
one
that
none
once
familiar
with
the
evidences
can
well
cease
to
believe
them
here
he
paused
and
i
asked
how
is
it
possible
that
the
means
you
employ
to
punish
those
who
have
wronged
you
should
not
in
some
cases
at
least
indicate
the
person
who
has
employed
them
because
he
said
the
means
of
vengeance
are
not
corporeal
the
agency
does
not
in
the
least
resemble
any
with
which
our
countrymen
or
apparently
your
race
on
earth
are
acquainted
a
traitor
would
be
found
dead
with
no
sign
of
suffering
or
injury
and
the
physician
would
pronounce
that
he
had
died
of
apoplexy
or
heart
disease
a
persecutor
or
one
who
had
unpardonably
wronged
any
of
the
children
of
the
star
might
go
mad
might
fling
himself
from
a
precipice
might
be
visited
with
the
most
terrible
series
of
calamities
all
natural
in
their
character
all
distinctly
traceable
to
natural
causes
but
astonishing
and
even
apparently
supernatural
in
their
accumulation
and
often
in
their
immediate
appropriateness
to
the
character
of
his
offence
our
neighbours
would
of
course
destroy
the
avenger
if
they
could
find
him
out
would
attempt
to
exterminate
our
society
could
they
prove
its
agency
but
surely
your
countrymen
must
either
disbelieve
in
such
agency
in
which
case
they
can
hardly
fear
your
vengeance
or
they
must
believe
it
and
then
would
deem
it
just
and
necessary
to
retaliate
no
he
said
they
disbelieve
in
the
possibility
while
they
are
forced
to
see
the
fact
it
is
impossible
they
would
say
that
a
man
should
be
injured
in
mind
or
body
reputation
or
estate
that
the
forces
of
nature
or
the
feelings
of
men
should
be
directed
against
him
without
the
intervention
of
any
material
agent
by
the
mere
will
of
those
who
take
no
traceable
means
to
give
that
will
effect
at
the
same
time
tradition
and
even
authentic
history
record
what
experience
confirms
that
every
one
who
has
wronged
us
deeply
has
come
to
some
terrible
end
each
man
would
ridicule
heartily
a
neighbour
who
should
allege
such
a
ground
for
fearing
to
injure
one
of
us
but
there
is
none
who
is
so
true
to
his
own
unbelief
as
to
do
that
which
in
every
instance
has
been
followed
by
signal
and
awful
disaster
moreover
we
do
by
visible
symbols
suggest
a
relation
between
the
vengeance
and
the
crime
over
the
heart
of
criminals
who
have
paid
with
their
lives
no
matter
by
what
immediate
agency
for
wrong
to
us
is
found
after
death
the
image
of
a
small
star
the
only
case
in
which
any
of
our
sacred
symbols
are
exposed
to
profane
eyes
surely
i
said
in
the
course
of
generations
and
with
your
numbers
you
must
be
often
watched
and
traced
and
some
one
spy
on
one
out
of
a
million
occasions
must
have
found
access
to
your
meetings
and
heard
and
seen
all
that
passed
our
meetings
he
said
are
held
where
no
human
eye
can
possibly
see
no
human
ear
hear
what
passes
the
chambers
meet
in
apartments
concealed
within
the
dwellings
of
individual
members
when
we
meet
the
doors
are
guarded
and
can
be
passed
only
by
those
who
give
a
token
and
a
password
and
if
these
could
become
known
to
an
enemy
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
would
lead
to
questions
that
would
at
once
expose
his
ignorance
of
our
simplest
secrets
he
would
learn
nothing
and
would
never
tell
his
story
to
the
outer
world
opening
the
door
or
rather
window
of
his
private
chamber
esmo
directed
our
eyes
to
a
portrait
sunk
in
the
wall
and
usually
concealed
by
a
screen
which
fitted
exactly
the
level
and
the
patterns
of
the
general
surface
it
displayed
in
a
green
vesture
not
unlike
his
own
but
with
a
gold
ribbon
and
emerald
symbol
like
the
cross
of
an
european
knighthood
over
the
right
shoulder
a
spare
soldierly
form
with
the
most
striking
countenance
i
have
ever
seen
one
which
once
seen
none
could
forget
the
white
long
hair
and
beard
the
former
reaching
the
shoulders
the
latter
falling
to
the
belt
were
not
only
unlike
the
fashion
of
this
generation
but
gave
tokens
of
age
never
discerned
in
mars
for
the
last
three
or
four
thousand
years
the
form
though
erect
and
even
stately
was
that
of
one
who
had
felt
the
long
since
abolished
infirmity
of
advancing
years
the
countenance
alone
bore
no
marks
of
old
age
it
was
full
unwrinkled
firm
in
physical
as
in
moral
character
calm
in
the
unresisted
power
of
intellect
and
will
over
the
passions
serene
in
a
dignity
too
absolute
and
for
pride
but
expressing
a
consciousness
of
command
over
others
as
evident
as
the
unconscious
effortless
command
of
self
to
which
it
owed
its
supreme
and
sublime
quietude
the
lips
were
not
set
as
with
a
habit
of
reserve
or
but
close
and
even
as
in
the
repose
to
which
restraint
had
never
been
necessary
the
features
were
large
clearly
defined
and
perfect
in
shape
proportion
and
outline
the
brow
was
massive
and
broad
but
strangely
smooth
and
even
the
head
had
no
single
marked
development
or
deficiency
that
could
have
enlightened
a
phrenologist
as
the
face
told
no
tale
that
a
physiognomist
could
read
the
dark
deep
eyes
were
unescapable
while
in
presence
of
the
portrait
you
could
not
for
a
moment
avoid
or
forget
their
living
fixed
direct
look
into
your
own
even
in
the
painted
representation
of
that
gaze
almost
too
calm
in
its
absolute
mastery
to
be
called
searching
or
scrutinising
yet
seeming
to
look
through
the
eyes
into
the
soul
there
was
an
almost
mesmeric
influence
as
if
across
the
abyss
of
ten
thousand
years
the
master
could
still
control
the
wills
and
draw
forth
the
inner
thoughts
of
the
living
as
he
had
dominated
the
spirits
of
their
remotest
ancestors
chapter
ix
manners
and
customs
next
morning
esmo
asked
me
to
accompany
him
on
a
visit
to
the
seaport
i
have
mentioned
in
the
course
of
this
journey
i
had
opportunities
of
learning
many
things
respecting
the
social
and
practical
conditions
of
human
life
and
industry
on
mars
that
had
hitherto
been
unknown
to
me
and
to
appreciate
the
enormous
advance
in
material
civilisation
which
has
accompanied
what
seems
to
me
as
it
would
probably
seem
to
any
other
a
terrible
moral
degeneration
most
of
these
things
i
learned
partly
from
my
own
observation
partly
from
the
explanations
of
my
companion
some
exclusively
from
what
he
told
me
we
passed
a
house
in
process
of
building
and
here
i
learned
the
manner
in
which
the
wonders
of
domestic
architecture
which
had
so
surprised
me
by
their
perfection
and
beauty
are
accomplished
the
material
employed
in
all
buildings
is
originally
liquid
or
rather
viscous
in
the
first
place
the
foundation
is
excavated
to
a
depth
of
two
or
three
feet
the
ground
beaten
hard
and
the
liquid
concrete
poured
into
the
level
tank
thus
formed
when
this
has
hardened
sufficiently
to
admit
of
their
erection
thin
frames
of
metal
are
erected
enclosing
the
spaces
to
be
occupied
by
the
several
outer
and
interior
walls
these
spaces
are
filled
with
the
concrete
at
a
temperature
of
about
the
tracery
and
the
impressed
on
the
walls
are
obtained
by
means
of
patterns
embossed
or
marked
upon
thinner
sheets
placed
inside
the
metallic
frames
the
hardening
is
effected
partly
by
sudden
cooling
partly
by
the
application
of
electricity
under
great
hydraulic
pressure
the
flat
roof
is
constructed
in
the
same
manner
the
whole
mass
when
the
fluid
concrete
is
solidified
being
simply
one
continuous
stone
as
hard
and
cohesive
as
granite
where
a
flat
roof
would
be
liable
to
give
way
or
break
from
its
own
weight
the
arch
or
dome
is
employed
to
give
the
required
strength
and
consequently
all
the
largest
martial
buildings
are
constructed
in
the
form
of
vaults
or
domes
as
regards
the
form
of
the
building
individual
or
public
taste
is
absolutely
free
it
being
just
as
easy
to
construct
a
circular
or
octagonal
as
a
rectangular
house
or
chamber
but
the
latter
form
is
almost
exclusively
employed
for
private
dwellings
the
lustre
and
brilliancy
i
have
described
are
given
to
the
surfaces
of
the
walls
by
the
simultaneous
action
of
cold
electricity
and
pressure
the
principle
of
which
esmo
could
not
so
explain
as
to
render
it
intelligible
to
me
almost
the
whole
physical
labour
is
done
by
machinery
from
the
digging
and
mixing
of
the
materials
to
their
conveyance
and
delivery
into
the
place
prepared
for
them
by
the
erection
of
the
metallic
frames
and
from
the
erection
to
the
removal
of
the
latter
the
translucent
material
for
the
windows
i
have
described
is
prepared
by
a
separate
process
and
in
distinct
factories
and
ready
hardened
and
cut
into
sheets
of
the
required
size
is
brought
to
the
building
and
fixed
in
its
place
by
machinery
it
can
be
tinted
to
the
taste
of
the
purchaser
but
as
a
rule
a
tintless
crystal
is
preferred
the
entire
work
of
building
a
large
house
from
the
foundation
to
the
finishing
and
removal
of
the
metallic
frames
occupies
from
to
eighteen
workmen
from
four
to
eight
days
this
like
most
other
labour
in
mars
goes
on
continuously
the
electric
lamps
raised
to
a
great
height
on
hollow
metallic
poles
affording
by
night
a
very
sufficient
substitute
for
the
light
of
the
sun
all
work
is
done
by
three
relays
of
artisans
the
first
set
working
from
noon
till
evening
the
next
from
evening
till
morning
and
the
third
from
morning
to
noon
the
martial
day
which
consists
of
about
hours
forty
minutes
of
our
time
is
divided
in
a
somewhat
peculiar
manner
the
periods
of
which
mean
sunrise
and
sunset
are
severally
the
middle
points
are
respectively
called
the
morning
and
evening
two
periods
of
the
same
length
before
and
after
noon
and
midnight
are
distinguished
as
the
first
and
second
dark
the
first
and
second
zyda
there
remain
four
intervals
of
three
hours
each
popularly
described
as
the
sleeping
waking
and
zyda
respectively
this
is
the
popular
reckoning
and
that
marked
upon
the
instruments
which
record
time
for
ordinary
purposes
and
by
these
the
meals
and
other
industrial
and
domestic
epochs
are
fixed
but
for
purposes
of
exact
calculation
the
day
beginning
an
hour
before
mean
sunrise
is
distributed
into
twelve
periods
or
antoi
of
a
little
more
than
two
terrestrial
hours
each
these
again
are
subdivided
by
twelve
into
periods
of
a
little
more
than
and
respectively
but
of
these
the
second
and
last
are
alone
employed
in
common
speech
the
uniform
employment
of
twelve
as
the
divisor
and
multiplier
in
tables
of
weight
distance
time
and
space
as
well
as
in
arithmetical
notation
has
all
the
conveniences
of
the
decimal
system
of
france
and
some
others
besides
due
to
the
greater
convenience
of
twelve
as
a
base
but
as
regards
the
larger
divisions
of
time
the
martials
are
placed
at
a
great
disadvantage
by
the
absence
of
any
such
intermediate
divisions
as
the
moon
has
suggested
to
terrestrials
the
revolutions
of
the
satellites
are
too
rapid
and
their
periods
too
brief
to
be
of
service
in
dividing
their
year
of
solar
days
martial
civilisation
having
taken
its
rise
within
the
tropics
indeed
the
equatorial
continents
which
only
here
and
there
extend
far
into
the
temperate
zone
and
two
minor
continents
in
the
southern
ocean
are
the
only
portions
of
the
planet
the
demarcation
of
the
seasons
afforded
by
the
solstices
have
been
comparatively
disregarded
the
year
is
divided
into
winter
and
summer
each
beginning
with
the
equinox
and
distinguished
as
the
north
and
south
summer
respectively
but
these
being
exceedingly
different
in
duration
the
northern
half
of
the
planet
having
a
summer
exceeding
by
days
that
of
the
southern
hemisphere
are
of
no
use
as
accurate
divisions
of
time
time
is
reckoned
accordingly
from
the
first
day
of
the
year
the
day
being
incomplete
and
the
new
year
beginning
at
the
moment
of
the
equinox
with
the
day
in
remote
ages
the
lapse
of
time
was
marked
by
festivals
and
holidays
occurring
at
fixed
periods
but
the
principle
of
utility
has
long
since
abolished
all
anniversaries
except
those
fixed
by
nature
and
these
pass
without
public
observance
and
almost
without
notice
the
climate
is
comparatively
equable
in
the
northern
hemisphere
the
summer
of
the
south
being
hotter
and
the
winter
colder
as
the
planet
is
much
nearer
the
sun
during
the
former
on
an
average
the
solar
disc
seems
about
half
as
large
as
to
eyes
on
earth
but
the
continents
lying
in
a
belt
around
the
middle
of
the
planet
nearly
the
whole
of
its
population
enjoy
the
advantages
of
tropical
regularity
there
are
two
brief
rainy
seasons
on
the
equator
and
in
its
neighbourhood
and
one
at
each
of
the
tropics
outside
these
the
cold
of
winter
is
aggravated
by
cloud
and
mist
the
barometer
records
from
inches
to
inches
at
the
storms
are
slight
brief
and
infrequent
the
tides
are
insignificant
and
were
safe
and
easy
even
before
martial
ingenuity
devised
vessels
which
are
almost
independent
of
weather
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
a
clear
sky
from
the
morning
to
the
evening
zyda
may
be
reckoned
upon
with
almost
absolute
confidence
a
heavy
dew
thoroughly
watering
the
whole
surface
rendering
the
rarity
of
rain
no
inconvenience
to
agriculture
falls
during
the
earlier
hours
of
the
night
which
nevertheless
remains
cloudy
while
the
periods
of
sunset
and
sunrise
are
as
i
have
already
said
marked
almost
invariably
by
dense
mist
extending
from
one
to
four
thousand
feet
above
the
according
to
latitude
and
season
from
the
dissipation
of
the
morning
to
the
fall
of
the
evening
mist
the
tropical
temperature
ranges
according
to
the
time
of
the
day
and
year
from
to
a
very
sudden
change
takes
place
at
sunset
except
within
of
the
equator
night
frosts
prevail
during
no
small
part
of
the
year
fine
nights
are
at
all
times
chilly
and
men
employed
out
of
doors
from
the
fall
of
the
evening
to
the
dispersal
of
the
morning
mists
rely
on
an
unusually
warm
of
soft
leather
as
flexible
as
kid
but
thicker
which
is
said
to
keep
in
the
warmth
of
the
body
far
better
than
any
woven
material
women
who
from
whatever
reason
venture
out
at
night
wear
the
warmest
cloaks
they
can
procure
those
of
limited
means
wear
a
loosely
woven
hair
or
woollen
in
lieu
of
their
usual
outdoor
garment
resembling
tufted
cotton
those
who
can
afford
them
substitute
for
the
envelope
of
down
described
a
while
back
warm
skin
or
fur
overgarments
obtained
from
the
lands
and
seas
and
furnished
sometimes
by
a
creature
not
very
unlike
our
polar
bear
but
passing
half
his
time
in
the
water
and
living
on
fish
sometimes
by
a
mammal
more
resembling
something
intermediate
between
the
mammoth
and
the
walrus
with
the
habits
of
the
hippopotamus
and
a
fur
not
unlike
the
sealskin
so
much
affected
in
europe
outside
the
city
at
a
distance
protecting
it
from
any
unpleasant
vapours
which
besides
were
carried
up
metallic
tubes
of
enormous
height
were
several
factories
of
great
extent
some
chemical
some
textile
others
reducing
from
their
ores
purifying
forging
and
producing
in
bulk
and
forms
convenient
for
their
various
uses
the
numerous
metals
employed
in
mars
the
most
important
of
these
is
obtained
from
a
tenacious
soil
much
resembling
our
own
clay
it
is
far
lighter
than
tin
has
the
colour
and
lustre
of
silver
and
never
tarnishes
the
only
rust
produced
by
oxidation
of
its
surface
being
a
white
loose
powder
which
can
be
brushed
or
shaken
off
without
difficulty
of
this
nearly
all
martial
utensils
and
furniture
are
constructed
and
its
susceptibility
to
the
electric
current
renders
it
especially
useful
for
mechanical
purposes
electricity
supplying
the
chief
if
not
the
sole
employed
in
martial
industry
the
largest
factories
however
employ
but
a
few
hands
the
machinery
being
so
perfect
as
to
perform
with
very
little
interposition
from
human
hands
the
whole
work
from
the
first
purification
to
the
final
arrangement
i
saw
a
mass
of
ore
as
dug
out
from
the
ground
put
into
one
end
of
a
long
series
of
machines
which
came
out
without
the
slightest
manual
assistance
at
the
close
of
a
course
of
operations
so
directed
as
to
bring
it
back
to
our
feet
in
the
form
of
a
thin
sheet
of
lustrous
metal
in
another
factory
a
mass
of
dry
vegetable
fibre
was
similarly
transformed
by
machinery
alone
into
a
bale
of
wonderfully
light
woven
drapery
resembling
satin
in
lustre
muslin
or
gauze
in
texture
the
streets
were
what
even
in
the
finest
and
american
cities
would
be
thought
magnificent
in
size
and
admirable
in
construction
the
roadway
was
formed
of
that
concrete
harder
than
granite
which
is
the
sole
material
employed
in
martial
building
and
which
as
i
have
shown
can
take
every
form
and
texture
from
that
of
jewels
or
of
the
finest
marble
to
that
of
plain
polished
slate
along
each
side
ran
avenues
of
magnificent
trees
whose
branches
met
at
a
height
of
thirty
feet
over
the
centre
between
these
and
the
houses
was
a
space
reserved
for
the
passage
of
light
carriages
exclusively
the
houses
unlike
those
in
the
country
were
from
two
to
four
stories
in
height
all
private
dwellings
however
were
built
as
in
the
country
around
a
square
interior
garden
and
the
windows
except
those
of
the
front
rooms
employed
for
business
purposes
looked
out
upon
this
the
space
occupied
however
was
of
course
much
smaller
than
where
ground
was
less
precious
few
dwellings
having
four
chambers
on
the
same
floor
and
front
the
footway
ran
on
the
level
of
what
we
call
the
first
story
over
a
part
of
the
roof
of
the
ground
floor
and
the
business
apartments
were
always
the
front
chambers
of
the
former
while
the
stores
of
the
merchants
were
collected
in
a
single
warehouse
occupying
the
whole
of
the
ground
front
no
attempt
was
made
to
exhibit
them
as
on
earth
i
entered
with
my
host
a
number
of
what
we
should
call
shops
in
every
case
he
named
exactly
the
article
he
wanted
and
it
was
either
produced
at
once
or
he
was
told
that
it
was
not
to
be
had
there
a
thing
which
however
seldom
happened
the
traders
are
few
in
number
one
or
two
firms
engaged
in
a
single
branch
of
commerce
do
the
whole
business
of
an
extensive
province
for
instance
all
the
textile
fabrics
on
sale
in
the
province
were
to
be
seen
in
one
or
other
of
two
warehouses
all
metals
in
sheets
blocks
and
wires
in
another
in
a
third
all
finished
except
writing
materials
all
writing
phonographic
and
telegraphic
conveniences
in
a
fourth
all
furs
feathers
and
fabrics
made
from
these
in
a
fifth
the
tradesman
sells
on
commission
as
we
say
receiving
the
goods
from
the
manufacturer
the
farmer
or
the
state
and
paying
only
for
what
are
sold
at
the
end
of
each
year
reserving
to
himself
of
the
price
prices
however
do
not
vary
from
year
to
year
save
when
on
rare
occasions
an
adverse
season
or
a
special
accident
affects
the
supply
and
consequently
the
price
of
any
natural
product
choice
fruit
skins
silver
for
instance
obtained
only
from
some
peculiarly
favoured
locality
the
monetary
system
like
so
many
other
martial
institutions
is
purely
artificial
and
severely
logical
it
is
held
that
the
exchange
value
of
any
article
of
manufacture
or
agricultural
produce
tends
steadily
downwards
while
any
article
obtained
by
mining
labour
or
supplied
by
nature
alone
tends
to
become
more
and
more
costly
the
use
of
any
one
article
of
either
class
as
a
measure
of
value
tends
in
the
to
injustice
either
towards
creditors
or
debtors
labour
may
be
considered
as
the
most
constant
in
intrinsic
value
of
all
things
capable
of
sale
or
barter
but
the
utmost
ingenuity
of
martial
philosophers
has
failed
to
devise
a
fixed
standard
by
which
one
kind
of
labour
can
be
measured
against
another
and
their
respective
productive
force
and
consequently
their
value
in
exchange
ascertained
one
thing
alone
retains
in
their
opinion
an
intrinsic
value
always
the
same
and
if
it
increase
in
value
increases
only
in
proportion
as
all
produce
is
obtained
in
greater
quantities
or
with
greater
facility
land
therefore
is
in
their
estimation
theoretically
the
best
available
measure
of
value
a
dogma
which
has
more
practical
truth
in
a
planet
where
population
is
evenly
diffused
and
increases
very
slowly
if
at
all
than
it
might
have
in
the
densely
but
unevenly
peopled
countries
of
europe
or
asia
a
or
square
of
about
fifty
yards
rather
more
than
half
an
acre
is
the
primary
standard
unit
of
value
for
purposes
of
currency
this
is
represented
by
a
small
engraved
document
bearing
the
government
stamp
which
can
always
at
pleasure
be
exchanged
for
so
much
land
in
a
particular
situation
the
region
whose
soil
is
chosen
as
the
standard
lies
under
the
equator
and
the
state
possesses
there
some
hundreds
of
square
miles
let
out
on
terms
thought
to
ensure
its
excellent
cultivation
and
the
permanence
of
its
condition
the
immediate
convertibility
of
each
such
document
engraven
on
a
small
piece
of
metal
about
two
inches
long
by
one
in
breadth
and
the
fortieth
part
of
an
inch
in
thickness
is
the
ultimate
cause
and
permanent
guarantee
of
its
value
large
payments
moreover
have
to
be
made
to
the
state
by
those
who
rent
its
lands
or
purchase
the
various
articles
of
which
it
possesses
a
monopoly
or
again
in
return
for
the
services
it
undertakes
as
lighting
roads
and
supplying
water
to
districts
dependent
on
a
distant
source
great
care
is
taken
to
keep
the
issue
of
these
notes
within
safe
limits
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
rather
more
valuable
than
the
land
they
represent
and
are
in
consequence
seldom
presented
for
redemption
therein
to
provide
against
the
possibility
of
such
an
as
might
exhaust
the
area
of
standard
land
at
command
of
the
state
it
is
enacted
that
failing
this
the
holder
may
select
his
portion
of
state
domain
wherever
he
pleases
at
twelve
years
purchase
of
the
rental
but
in
point
of
fact
these
provisions
are
theoretically
rather
than
practically
important
since
not
one
note
in
a
hundred
is
ever
redeemed
or
paid
off
the
square
measure
upon
which
the
coinage
if
i
may
so
call
it
is
based
following
exactly
the
measure
of
length
each
larger
area
in
the
ascending
scale
represents
times
that
below
it
thus
the

a
little
more
than
a

the
the
highest

so
to
speak
in
circulation
represents
this

but
all
calculations
are
made
in

twelfths
thereof

about
six

are
issued
for
the
third

of

are
represented
by
a
token
coinage
of
square
medals
composed
of
an
alloy
in
which
gold
and
silver
respectively
are
the
principal
elements
the

about
threepence
of
english
money
stopping
at
the
largest
public
building
in
the
city
a
central
hexagon
with
a
number
of
smaller
hexagons
rising
around
it
we
entered
one
of
the
latter
each
side
of
which
might
be
some
feet
in
length
and
in
height
here
were
ranged
a
large
number
of
instruments
on
the
principle
of
the
but
conveying
the
sound
to
a
vast
distance
along
electric
wires
into
one
which
reverses
the
process
and
repeats
the
vocal
sound
itself
through
one
of
these
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
one
of
the
officials
in
charge
of
them
esmo
carried
on
a
conversation
of
some
length
the
instrument
being
so
arranged
that
while
the
mouth
is
applied
to
one
tube
another
may
be
held
to
the
ear
to
receive
the
reply
in
the
meantime
i
fell
in
with
one
of
the
officers
apparently
very
young
who
was
strongly
interested
at
the
sight
of
the
stranger
and
perhaps
on
this
account
far
more
obliging
than
is
common
among
his
countrymen
from
him
i
learnt
that
this
with
another
method
i
will
presently
describe
is
the
sole
means
of
distant
communication
employed
in
mars
those
who
have
not
leisure
or
do
not
care
to
visit
one
of
the
offices
never
more
than
distant
from
one
another
in
which
the
public
instruments
are
kept
can
have
a
wire
conveyed
to
their
own
house
almost
every
house
of
any
pretension
possesses
such
a
wire
leading
me
into
the
next
apartment
my
friend
pointed
out
an
immense
number
of
instruments
of
a
shape
with
a
slit
in
which
a
leaf
of
about
four
inches
by
two
was
placed
these
were
constantly
ejected
and
on
the
instant
mechanically
replaced
the
fallen
leaves
were
collected
and
sorted
by
the
officers
present
and
at
once
placed
in
one
or
other
of
another
set
of
exactly
similar
instruments
any
one
possessing
a
private
wire
can
write
at
his
own
desk
in
the
manual
character
a
letter
or
message
on
one
of
these
slips
placing
it
in
his
own
instrument
it
at
once
reproduces
itself
exactly
in
his
autograph
and
with
every
peculiarity
blot
or
erasure
at
the
nearest
office
here
the
copy
is
placed
in
the
proper
box
and
at
once
reproduced
in
the
office
nearest
the
residence
of
the
person
to
whom
it
is
addressed
and
forwarded
in
the
same
manner
to
him
a
letter
therefore
covering
one
of
these
slips
and
saying
as
much
as
we
could
write
in
an
average
hand
upon
a
large
sheet
of
is
delivered
within
five
minutes
at
most
from
the
time
of
despatch
no
matter
how
great
the
distance
i
remarked
that
this
method
of
communication
made
privacy
impossible
but
replied
the
official
how
could
we
possibly
have
time
to
indulge
in
curiosity
we
have
to
sort
hundreds
of
these
papers
in
an
hour
we
have
just
time
to
look
at
the
address
place
them
in
the
proper
box
and
touch
the
spring
which
sets
the
electric
current
at
work
if
secrecy
were
needed
a
cipher
would
easily
secure
it
for
you
will
observe
that
by
this
telegraph
whatever
is
inscribed
on
the
sheet
is
mechanically
reproduced
and
it
would
be
as
easy
to
send
a
picture
as
a
message
i
learnt
that
a
post
of
marvellous
perfection
had
some
thousand
years
ago
delivered
letters
all
over
mars
but
it
was
now
employed
only
for
the
delivery
of
parcels
perhaps
half
the
commerce
of
mars
except
that
in
metals
and
agricultural
produce
depends
on
this
post
purchasers
of
standard
articles
describe
by
the
to
a
tradesman
the
exact
amount
and
pattern
of
the
goods
required
and
these
are
despatched
at
once
a
system
of
banking
very
completely
organised
enabling
the
buyer
to
pay
at
once
by
a
telegraphic
order
when
esmo
had
finished
his
business
we
walked
down
at
my
request
to
the
port
around
three
sides
of
the
dock
formed
by
walls
said
to
be
fifty
feet
in
depth
and
twenty
in
thickness
ran
a
road
close
to
the
water
edge
beyond
which
was
again
a
vast
continuous
warehouse
the
inner
side
was
reserved
for
passenger
vessels
and
everywhere
the
largest
ships
could
come
up
close
landing
either
passengers
or
cargo
without
even
the
intervention
of
a
plank
the
appearance
of
the
ships
is
very
unlike
that
of
terrestrial
vessels
they
have
no
masts
or
rigging
are
constructed
of
the
zorinta
which
in
mars
serves
much
more
effectively
all
the
uses
of
iron
and
differ
entirely
in
construction
as
they
are
intended
for
cargo
or
for
travel
mercantile
ships
are
in
shape
much
like
the
finest
american
clippers
but
with
broad
flat
keel
and
deck
and
with
a
hold
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
in
depth
like
malayan
vessels
they
have
attached
by
strong
bars
an
external
beam
about
fifty
feet
from
the
side
which
renders
overturning
almost
impossible
passenger
ships
more
resemble
the
form
of
a
fish
but
are
alike
at
both
ends
six
men
working
in
pairs
four
hours
at
a
time
compose
the
entire
crew
of
the
largest
ship
and
half
this
number
are
required
for
the
smallest
that
undertakes
a
voyage
of
more
than
twelve
hours
i
may
here
mention
that
the
system
of
sewage
is
far
superior
to
any
yet
devised
on
earth
no
particle
of
waste
is
allowed
to
pollute
the
waters
the
whole
is
deodorised
by
an
exceedingly
simple
process
and
whether
in
town
or
country
carried
away
daily
and
applied
to
its
natural
use
in
fertilising
the
soil
our
practice
of
throwing
away
where
it
is
an
obvious
and
often
dangerous
nuisance
material
so
valuable
in
its
proper
place
seemed
to
my
martial
friends
an
inexplicable
and
almost
incredible
absurdity
as
we
returned
esmo
told
me
that
he
had
been
in
communication
with
the
camptâ
who
had
desired
that
i
should
visit
him
with
the
least
possible
delay
this
he
said
will
hurry
us
in
matters
where
i
at
any
rate
should
have
preferred
a
little
delay
the
seat
of
government
is
by
a
direct
route
nearly
six
thousand
miles
distant
and
you
will
have
opportunity
of
travelling
in
all
the
different
ways
practised
on
this
planet
a
long
in
our
electric
carriages
with
which
you
are
not
familiar
is
i
think
to
be
avoided
the
camptâ
would
wish
to
see
your
vessel
as
well
as
yourself
but
on
the
whole
i
think
it
is
safer
to
leave
it
where
it
is
kevimâ
and
i
propose
to
accompany
you
during
the
first
part
of
your
journey
at
our
first
halt
we
will
stay
one
night
with
a
friend
that
you
may
be
admitted
a
brother
of
our
order
and
said
i
what
sort
of
a
reception
may
i
expect
at
the
end
of
my
journey
i
think
he
answered
that
you
are
more
likely
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
goodwill
of
the
camptâ
than
by
the
hostility
of
some
of
those
about
him
his
character
is
very
peculiar
and
it
is
difficult
to
reckon
upon
his
action
in
any
given
case
but
he
differs
from
nearly
all
his
subjects
in
having
a
strong
taste
for
adventure
none
the
less
if
it
be
perilous
and
since
his
position
prevents
him
from
indulging
this
taste
in
person
he
is
the
more
disposed
to
take
extreme
interest
in
the
adventures
of
others
he
has
moreover
a
great
value
for
what
you
call
courage
a
virtue
rarely
needed
and
still
more
rarely
shown
among
us
and
i
fancy
that
your
venture
through
space
has
impressed
him
with
a
very
high
estimate
of
your
daring
assuredly
none
of
us
however
great
his
scientific
curiosity
would
have
dreamed
of
incurring
such
a
peril
and
incurring
it
alone
but
i
must
give
you
one
warning
it
is
not
common
among
us
to
make
valuable
gifts
we
do
not
care
enough
for
any
but
ourselves
to
give
except
with
the
idea
of
getting
something
valuable
in
return
our
princes
are
however
so
wealthy
that
they
can
give
without
sacrifice
and
it
is
considered
a
grave
affront
to
refuse
any
present
from
a
superior
whatever
then
our
suzerain
may
offer
you
and
he
is
almost
sure
unless
he
should
take
offence
to
give
you
whatever
he
thinks
will
induce
you
to
settle
permanently
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
court
you
must
accept
graciously
and
on
no
account
either
then
or
afterwards
lead
him
to
think
that
you
slight
his
present
i
must
say
i
replied
that
while
i
wish
to
remain
in
your
world
till
i
have
learnt
if
not
all
that
is
to
be
learnt
yet
very
much
more
than
i
at
present
know
about
it
the
whole
purpose
of
my
voyage
would
be
sacrificed
if
i
could
not
effect
my
return
to
earth
i
suppose
so
he
answered
and
for
that
reason
i
wish
to
keep
your
vessel
safe
and
within
your
reach
for
to
get
away
at
all
you
may
have
to
depart
suddenly
but
you
will
not
do
wisely
to
make
the
prince
suspect
that
such
is
your
intention
tell
him
of
what
you
wish
to
see
and
to
explore
in
this
world
tell
him
freely
of
your
own
for
he
will
not
readily
fancy
that
you
prefer
it
to
this
but
say
as
little
as
possible
of
your
hopes
of
an
ultimate
return
and
if
you
are
forced
to
acknowledge
them
let
them
seem
as
indefinite
as
possible
by
this
time
returning
by
another
road
esmo
stopped
the
carriage
at
the
gate
of
an
enclosed
garden
of
moderate
size
about
two
miles
from
ecasfe
entering
alone
he
presently
returned
with
another
gentleman
wearing
a
dress
of
grey
and
silver
with
a
white
ribbon
over
the
shoulder
a
badge
i
found
of
official
rank
or
duties
mounting
his
own
carriage
this
person
accompanied
us
home
chapter
x
woman
and
wedlock
we
arrived
at
home
in
the
course
of
some
few
minutes
and
here
my
host
requested
us
to
wait
in
the
hall
where
in
about
he
rejoined
us
accompanied
by
all
the
members
of
his
family
the
ladies
all
closely
veiled
looking
among
them
instinctively
for
eveena
i
observed
that
she
had
exchanged
her
usual
light
veil
for
one
fuller
and
denser
and
wore
contrary
to
the
wont
of
maidens
indoors
sleeves
and
gloves
she
held
her
father
hand
and
evinced
no
little
agitation
or
alarm
the
visitor
stood
by
a
table
on
which
had
been
placed
the
usual
pencils
or
styles
and
a
sort
of
open
portfolio
on
one
side
of
which
was
laid
a
small
strip
of
the
golden
tafroo
inscribed
with
crimson
characters
of
unusual
size
leaving
several
blanks
here
and
there
most
of
these
he
filled
up
and
then
leading
forward
his
daughter
esmo
signed
to
me
also
to
approach
the
table
the
others
stood
just
behind
us
and
the
official
then
placed
the
document
in
eveena
hand
she
looked
through
it
and
replaced
it
on
the
table
with
the
gesture
of
assent
usual
among
her
people
inclining
her
head
and
raising
her
left
hand
to
her
lips
the
document
was
then
handed
to
me
but
i
of
course
was
unable
to
read
it
i
said
so
and
the
official
read
it
aloud
between
eveena
daughter
of
esmo
dent
ecasfen
and
the
alleged
covenant
eveena
will
live
with
in
wedlock
for
two
years
foregoing
during
that
period
the
liberty
to
quit
his
house
or
to
receive
any
one
therein
save
by
his
permission
in
consideration
whereof
he
will
maintain
her
clothing
her
to
her
satisfaction
at
a
cost
not
exceeding
five
stâltau
by
the
year
he
will
provide
for
any
child
or
children
she
may
bear
while
living
with
him
or
within
twice
twelve
dozen
days
thereafter
and
if
at
any
time
he
shall
dismiss
her
or
permit
her
to
leave
him
or
if
she
shall
desire
to
leave
him
after
the
expiration
of
eight
years
he
will
ensure
to
her
for
her
life
an
annual
payment
of
fifteen
stâltau
neither
shall
appeal
to
a
court
of
law
or
public
authority
against
the
other
on
account
of
anything
done
during
the
time
they
shall
live
together
except
for
attempt
to
kill
or
for
grave
bodily
injury
such
is
the
form
of
marriage
covenant
employed
in
mars
the
occasion
was
unfit
for
discussion
and
i
simply
intimated
my
acceptance
of
the
covenants
oo
which
eveena
and
myself
forthwith
were
instructed
to
write
our
names
where
they
appear
in
the
above
translation
the
official
then
inquired
whether
i
recognised
the
lady
standing
beside
me
as
eveena
daughter
of
esmo
it
then
struck
me
that
though
i
felt
pretty
certain
of
her
identity
marriage
under
such
conditions
might
occasionally
lead
to
awkward
mistakes
there
was
no
such
difference
between
my
bride
and
her
companions
as
but
for
her
dress
and
her
agitation
would
have
enabled
me
positively
to
distinguish
them
veiled
and
silent
as
all
were
i
expressed
no
doubt
however
and
the
official
then
proceeded
to
affix
his
own
stamp
to
the
document
and
then
lifting
up
that
on
which
our
names
had
actually
been
written
showed
that
by
some
process
i
hardly
understand
the
signature
had
been
executed
and
the
agreement
filled
up
in
triplicate
the
officer
preserving
one
copy
the
others
being
given
to
the
bride
and
bridegroom
respectively
the
ladies
then
retired
esmo
his
son
and
the
official
remaining
when
two
ambau
brought
in
a
tray
of
refreshments
the
official
tasted
each
article
offered
to
him
evidently
more
as
a
matter
of
form
than
of
pleasure
i
took
this
opportunity
to
ask
some
questions
regarding
the
martial
cuisine
and
learnt
that
all
but
the
very
simplest
cookery
is
performed
by
professional
confectioners
who
supply
twice
a
day
the
households
in
their
vicinity
unmarried
men
taking
their
meals
at
the
shop
the
preparation
of
fruit
roasted
grain
beverages
consisting
of
juices
mixed
with
a
prepared
nectar
and
the
vegetables
from
the
garden
which
enter
into
the
composition
of
every
meal
are
the
only
culinary
cares
of
the
ladies
of
the
family
everything
can
be
warmed
or
freshened
on
the
stove
which
forms
a
part
of
that
electric
machinery
by
which
in
every
household
the
baths
and
lights
are
supplied
and
the
house
warmed
at
night
the
ladies
have
therefore
very
little
household
work
and
the
greater
part
of
this
is
performed
under
their
superintendence
by
the
animals
which
are
almost
as
useful
as
any
human
slaves
on
earth
with
the
one
unquestionable
advantage
that
they
can
not
speak
and
therefore
can
not
be
impertinent
inquisitive
or
treacherous
no
fermented
liquors
form
part
of
the
martial
diet
but
some
narcotics
resembling
haschisch
and
opium
are
much
relished
when
the
official
had
retired
i
said
to
my
host
i
thought
it
best
to
raise
no
question
or
objection
in
signing
the
contract
put
before
me
with
your
sanction
but
you
must
be
aware
in
the
first
place
that
i
have
no
means
here
of
performing
the
pecuniary
part
of
the
covenant
no
means
of
providing
either
maintenance
or
the
explanation
of
the
latter
phrase
which
was
immediately
demanded
produced
not
a
little
amusement
after
which
esmo
replied
gravely
it
will
be
very
easy
for
you
if
necessary
to
realise
a
competence
in
the
course
of
half
a
year
a
book
relating
your
adventures
and
describing
the
world
you
have
left
would
bring
you
in
a
very
comfortable
fortune
and
you
might
more
than
double
this
by
giving
addresses
in
each
of
our
towns
which
if
only
from
the
curiosity
our
people
would
entertain
to
see
you
with
their
own
eyes
would
attract
crowded
audiences
you
could
get
a
considerable
sum
for
the
exclusive
right
to
take
your
likeness
and
if
you
chose
to
explain
it
you
might
fix
your
own
price
on
the
novel
motive
power
you
have
introduced
but
there
is
another
point
in
regard
to
the
contract
which
you
have
overlooked
but
which
i
was
bound
to
bear
in
mind
what
you
have
promised
is
i
believe
what
eveena
would
have
obtained
from
any
suitor
she
was
likely
to
accept
but
since
you
left
the
matter
entirely
to
my
discretion
i
am
bound
to
make
it
impossible
that
you
should
be
a
loser
and
this
document
and
he
handed
me
a
small
slip
very
much
like
that
which
contained
the
marriage
covenant
imposes
on
my
estate
the
payment
of
an
income
for
eveena
life
equal
to
that
you
have
promised
her
with
much
reluctance
i
found
myself
obliged
to
accept
a
dowry
which
however
natural
and
proper
on
earth
was
i
felt
unusual
in
mars
i
may
say
that
such
charges
do
not
interfere
with
the
free
sale
of
land
they
are
registered
in
the
proper
office
and
the
state
trustee
collects
them
from
the
owner
for
the
time
being
as
are
collected
in
great
britain
or
land
revenue
in
india
turning
to
another
but
kindred
question
i
said
your
marriage
contract
like
our
own
laws
appears
to
favour
the
weaker
sex
more
than
strict
theoretical
equality
would
permit
this
is
quite
right
and
practically
inevitable
but
it
hardly
agrees
with
the
theory
which
supposes
bride
and
bridegroom
husband
and
wife
to
enter
on
and
maintain
a
coequal
voluntary
partnership
how
so
he
inquired
the
right
of
divorce
i
said
at
the
end
of
two
years
belongs
to
the
wife
alone
the
husband
can
not
divorce
her
except
under
a
heavy
penalty
observe
he
answered
that
there
is
a
grave
practical
inequality
which
even
theory
can
hardly
ignore
the
wife
parts
with
something
by
the
very
fact
of
marriage
at
the
end
of
two
years
when
she
has
borne
two
three
or
four
children
her
value
in
marriage
is
greatly
lessened
her
capacity
of
maintaining
herself
in
the
days
when
women
did
work
was
found
practically
to
be
even
smaller
than
before
marriage
you
may
say
that
this
really
amounts
to
a
recognition
by
custom
of
the
natural
inequality
denied
by
law
but
at
any
rate
it
is
an
inequality
which
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
overlook
examine
the
practical
working
of
the
covenants
and
you
will
find
that
in
affecting
to
treat
unequals
as
equals
they
merely
make
the
weaker
the
slave
of
the
stronger
surely
i
said
husband
and
wife
are
so
far
equal
where
neither
is
tied
to
the
children
that
each
can
make
the
other
heartily
glad
to
assent
to
a
divorce
perhaps
where
law
interferes
to
enforce
monogamy
and
thereby
to
create
an
artificial
equality
of
mutual
dependence
but
our
law
can
not
dictate
to
equals
whose
sex
it
ignores
the
terms
or
numbers
of
partnership
so
the
terms
of
the
contract
being
voluntary
men
of
course
insist
on
excluding
legal
interference
in
household
quarrels
and
before
the
prohibitive
clause
was
generally
adopted
legal
interposition
did
more
harm
than
good
as
you
will
find
equality
before
the
law
gives
absolute
effect
to
the
real
inequality
and
chiefly
through
its
coarsest
element
superior
physical
force
the
liberty
that
is
a
necessary
logical
consequence
of
equality
takes
from
the
woman
her
one
natural
safeguard
the
man
need
of
her
goodwill
if
not
of
her
affection
in
our
world
i
replied
i
always
held
that
even
slaves
so
they
be
household
slaves
are
secure
against
gross
cruelty
the
owner
can
not
make
life
a
burden
to
them
without
imperilling
his
own
to
reduce
the
question
to
its
lowest
terms
malice
will
always
be
a
match
for
muscle
and
poison
an
efficient
antidote
to
the
so
rejoined
esmo
our
men
have
perceived
and
consequently
they
have
excepted
attempts
to
murder
as
the
women
have
excepted
serious
bodily
injury
from
the
general
rule
prohibiting
appeals
to
a
court
of
law
and
said
i
are
there
many
such
appeals
not
one
in
two
years
he
replied
and
for
a
simple
reason
our
law
as
matter
of
course
and
of
common
sense
puts
murder
attempted
or
accomplished
on
the
same
footing
and
visits
both
with
its
supreme
penalty
consequently
a
wife
detected
in
such
an
attempt
is
at
her
husband
mercy
and
if
he
consent
to
spare
her
life
she
must
submit
to
any
infliction
however
it
may
transgress
the
covenanted
limit
in
fact
if
he
find
her
out
in
such
an
attempt
he
may
do
anything
but
put
her
to
death
on
his
own
authority
still
i
answered
as
long
as
she
remains
in
the
house
she
must
have
frequent
opportunity
of
repeating
her
attempt
at
revenge
and
to
live
in
constant
fear
of
assassination
would
break
down
the
strongest
nerves
our
physicians
he
said
are
more
skilful
in
antidotes
than
our
women
in
poisons
even
when
the
latter
have
learned
chemistry
no
poisonous
plants
are
grown
near
our
houses
and
as
wives
never
go
out
alone
they
have
little
chance
of
getting
hold
of
any
fatal
drug
i
believe
that
very
few
attempts
to
poison
are
successful
and
that
many
women
have
suffered
very
severely
on
mere
suspicion
and
what
i
asked
is
the
legal
definition
of
bodily
injury
injury
he
said
of
which
serious
traces
remain
at
the
end
of
days
the
destruction
of
a
limb
or
the
deprivation
partial
or
total
of
a
sense
i
have
often
thought
bitterly
he
continued
of
that
boasted
logic
and
liberality
of
our
laws
under
which
my
daughters
might
have
to
endure
almost
any
maltreatment
from
their
husbands
so
long
as
these
have
but
the
sense
not
to
employ
weapons
that
leave
almost
ineffaceable
marks
this
is
one
main
reason
why
we
so
anxiously
avoid
giving
them
save
to
those
who
are
bound
by
the
ties
of
our
faith
to
treat
them
as
kindly
as
children
for
whom
at
the
worst
they
remain
sisters
of
the
order
if
women
generally
had
parents
our
marriage
law
could
never
have
carried
out
the
fiction
of
equality
to
its
logical
perfection
and
practical
monstrosity
equality
then
has
given
your
women
a
harder
life
and
a
worse
position
than
that
of
those
women
in
our
world
who
are
not
only
by
law
but
by
fact
and
custom
the
slaves
of
their
husbands
yes
indeed
he
said
and
our
proverbs
though
made
by
men
express
this
truth
with
a
sharpness
in
which
there
is
little
exaggeration
our
school
textbooks
tell
us
that
action
and
reaction
are
equal
and
opposite
and
this
familiar
phrase
gives
meaning
to
the
saw
dakâl
dakè
is
equal
the
thing
struck
to
the
hammer
meaning
that
woman
equality
to
man
is
no
more
effective
than
the
reaction
of
the
leather

the
mallet

of

that

that
is

came
to
the
door
and
made
a
sign
to
her
husband
waiting
courteously
to
ascertain
that
i
had
finished
speaking
and
until
his
son
had
somewhat
ceremoniously
taken
leave
of
me
he
led
me
to
the
door
of
a
chamber
next
to
that
i
had
hitherto
occupied
pausing
here
himself
he
motioned
me
to
go
on
and
the
door
parting
i
found
myself
in
a
room
i
had
not
before
entered
about
the
same
size
as
my
own
and
similarly
furnished
but
differently
coloured
now
communicating
with
it
by
a
door
which
i
knew
had
not
previously
existed
here
were
eveena
mother
and
sister
dressed
as
usual
eveena
herself
had
exchanged
her
maiden
white
for
the
light
pink
of
a
young
matron
but
was
closely
veiled
in
a
similar
material
her
mother
and
sister
kissed
her
with
much
emotion
though
without
the
tears
and
lamentations
real
or
affected
with
which
alike
among
the
nomads
of
asia
and
the
most
cultivated
races
of
europe
even
those
relatives
who
have
striven
hardest
to
marry
a
daughter
or
sister
think
it
necessary
to
celebrate
the
fulfilment
of
their
hopes
and
the
termination
of
their
often
prolonged
and
wearisome
labours
i
was
then
left
alone
with
my
bride
who
remained
on
the
cushions
in
a
corner
of
the
room
i
could
not
help
feeling
keenly
how
much
a
marriage
so
unceremonious
and
with
so
little
previous
acquaintance
or
rather
so
great
a
reserve
and
distance
in
our
former
intercourse
intensified
the
awkwardness
many
a
man
on
earth
feels
when
first
left
alone
with
the
partner
of
his
future
life
but
a
single
glance
at
the
small
drooping
figure
in
the
cushions
brought
the
reflection
that
a
situation
embarrassing
to
the
bridegroom
must
be
in
the
last
degree
alarming
and
distressing
to
the
bride
but
for
her
visit
to
the
astronaut
we
should
have
been
almost
strangers
i
could
hardly
have
recognised
even
her
voice
i
must
however
speak
and
naturally
my
first
sentence
was
a
request
that
she
would
remove
her
veil
no
she
whispered
rising
must
do
that
taking
off
the
glove
of
her
left
hand
she
came
up
to
me
shyly
and
slowly
and
placed
it
in
my
right
a
not
unmeaning
ceremony
having
obeyed
her
instruction
my
lips
touched
for
the
first
time
the
brow
of
my
young
wife
that
she
was
more
than
shy
and
startled
was
even
painfully
agitated
and
frightened
became
instantly
apparent
now
that
her
countenance
was
visible
what
must
be
the
state
of
martial
brides
in
general
when
the
signature
of
the
contract
immediately
places
them
at
the
disposal
of
an
utter
stranger
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
my
imagination
to
conceive
if
their
feelings
were
at
all
to
be
measured
by
eveena
under
conditions
sufficiently
trying
but
certainly
far
better
than
theirs
nothing
was
so
likely
to
quiet
her
as
perfect
calmness
on
my
side
and
though
with
a
heart
beating
almost
as
fast
as
her
own
if
with
very
different
emotions
i
led
her
gently
back
to
her
place
and
resting
on
a
cushion
just
out
of
reach
began
to
talk
to
her
choosing
as
the
easiest
subject
our
adventure
of
yesterday
i
asked
what
could
have
induced
her
to
place
herself
in
a
situation
so
dangerous
do
not
be
angry
with
me
now
she
pleaded
i
am
exceedingly
fond
of
flowers
they
have
been
my
only
amusement
except
the
training
of
my
pets
you
can
see
how
little
women
have
to
do
how
little
occupation
or
interest
is
permitted
us
the
rearing
of
rare
flowers
or
the
creation
of
new
ones
is
almost
the
only
employment
in
which
we
can
find
exercise
for
such
intelligence
as
we
possess
i
had
never
seen
before
the
flower
that
grew
on
that
shelf
i
believe
indeed
that
it
only
grows
on
a
few
of
our
higher
mountains
below
the
and
i
was
anxious
to
bring
it
home
and
see
what
could
be
made
of
it
in
the
garden
i
thought
it
might
be
developed
into
something
almost
as
beautiful
as
that
bright
you
admired
so
greatly
in
my
but
said
i
the
two
flowers
are
not
of
the
same
shape
or
colour
and
though
i
am
not
learned
in
botany
i
should
say
hardly
belong
to
the
same
family
no
she
said
but
with
care
and
with
proper
management
of
our
electric
apparatus
i
accomplished
this
year
a
change
almost
as
great
i
can
show
you
in
my
one
little
white
flower
of
no
great
beauty
and
conical
in
shape
from
which
i
have
produced
in
two
years
another
pink
and
of
thrice
the
size
almost
exactly
realising
an
imaginary
flower
drawn
by
my
to
represent
one
of
which
she
had
dreamed
we
can
often
produce
the
very
shape
size
and
colour
we
wish
from
something
that
at
first
seems
to
have
no
likeness
to
it
whatever
and
i
have
been
told
that
a
skilful
farmer
will
often
obtain
a
fruit
or
what
is
more
difficult
an
animal
to
answer
exactly
the
ideal
he
has
formed
some
of
our
breeders
i
said
profess
to
develop
a
sort
of
ideal
of
any
given
species
but
it
takes
many
generations
by
picking
and
choosing
those
that
vary
in
the
right
direction
to
accomplish
anything
of
the
kind
and
after
all
the
difference
between
the
original
and
the
improved
form
is
mere
development
not
essential
change
she
hardly
seemed
to
understand
this
but
answered
the
seedling
or
rootlet
would
be
just
like
the
original
plant
if
we
did
not
from
the
first
control
its
growth
by
means
of
our
electric
frames
but
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
show
you
what
i
have
done
in
my
own
and
you
will
have
opportunities
of
seeing
afterwards
how
very
much
more
is
done
by
agriculturists
with
much
more
time
and
much
more
potent
electricities
at
any
rate
i
said
if
i
had
known
your
object
you
certainly
should
have
had
the
flowers
for
which
you
risked
so
much
and
if
i
remain
here
three
days
longer
i
promise
you
plenty
of
specimens
for
your
experiment
you
do
not
mean
to
go
back
to
the
astronaut
she
asked
with
an
air
of
absolute
consternation
i
had
not
intended
to
do
so
i
replied
for
it
seems
to
be
perfectly
safe
under
your
father
seal
and
your
stringent
laws
of
property
but
now
if
time
permit
i
must
get
these
flowers
to
which
you
tell
me
i
am
so
deeply
indebted
you
are
very
kind
returned
eveena
earnestly
but
i
entreat
you
not
to
venture
there
again
i
should
be
utterly
miserable
while
you
were
running
such
a
risk
again
and
for
such
a
trifle
it
is
no
such
terrible
risk
to
me
and
to
please
you
is
not
quite
a
trifle
besides
i
ought
to
deserve
my
prize
better
than
i
have
yet
done
but
you
seem
to
have
some
especial
spite
against
the
unlucky
vessel
that
brought
me
here
and
that
i
added
smiling
seems
hardly
gracious
in
a
bride
of
an
hour
no
no
she
murmured
evidently
much
distressed
but
the
vessel
that
brought
you
here
may
take
you
away
i
will
not
pain
you
yet
by
saying
that
i
hope
it
may
at
all
events
it
shall
not
do
so
till
you
are
content
that
it
should
she
made
no
answer
and
seemed
for
some
time
to
hesitate
as
if
afraid
or
unwilling
to
say
something
which
rose
irrepressibly
to
her
lips
a
few
persuasive
words
however
encouraged
her
and
she
found
her
voice
though
with
a
faltering
accent
which
greatly
surprised
me
when
i
learned
at
last
the
purport
of
her
request
i
do
not
understand
she
said
your
ideas
or
customs
but
i
know
they
are
different
from
ours
i
have
found
at
least
that
they
make
you
much
more
indulgent
and
tender
to
women
than
our
own
and
i
hope
therefore
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
ask
more
than
i
have
any
right
to
do
i
could
scarcely
refuse
my
bride
first
request
whatever
it
might
be
but
your
hesitation
and
your
apologies
might
make
me
fear
that
you
are
about
to
ask
something
which
one
or
both
of
us
may
wish
hereafter
had
neither
been
asked
nor
granted
she
still
hesitated
and
faltered
till
i
began
to
fancy
that
her
wish
must
have
a
much
graver
import
than
i
at
first
supposed
perhaps
to
treat
the
matter
lightly
and
sportively
would
be
the
course
most
likely
to
encourage
her
to
explain
it
what
is
it
child
i
asked
which
you
think
the
stranger
of
another
world
more
likely
to
grant
than
one
of
your
own
race
and
which
is
so
extravagant
nevertheless
that
you
tremble
to
ask
it
even
from
me
is
it
too
much
to
be
bound
not
to
appeal
against
me
to
the
law
which
can
not
yet
determine
whether
i
am
a
reality
or
a
fiction
or
have
i
proved
my
arm
a
little
too
substantial
must
the
giant
promise
not
to
exercise
the
masculine
prerogative
of
physical
force
safely
conceded
to
the
dwarf
fie
eveena
i
am
almost
afraid
to
touch
you
lest
i
should
hurt
you
unawares
lest
tenderness
itself
should
transgress
the
limit
of
legal
cruelty
and
do
grave
bodily
harm
to
a
creature
so
much
more
like
a
fairy
than
a
woman
no
no
she
expostulated
not
at
all
reciprocating
the
jesting
tone
in
which
i
spoke
if
you
would
consent
to
give
such
a
promise
it
is
just
one
of
those
we
should
wish
unmade
how
could
i
ask
you
to
promise
that
i
may
behave
as
ill
as
i
please
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
frightened
to
tears
when
you
are
angry
but
i
shall
never
wish
you
to
retain
your
anger
rather
than
vent
it
and
forgive
the
proverb
says
punishes
pardons
who
hates
awaits
no
pray
do
not
play
with
me
i
am
so
much
in
earnest
i
know
that
i
do
understand
where
and
why
your
thoughts
and
ways
are
so
unlike
ours
but
but
i
thought
i
fancied
you
seemed
to
hold
the
tie
between
man
and
wife
something
more
faster
more
lasting
than
our
contract
has
made
it
certainly
with
us
it
lasts
for
life
at
least
and
even
here
where
it
may
be
broken
at
pleasure
i
should
not
have
thought
that
on
the
very
bridal
eve
the
coldest
heart
could
willingly
look
forward
to
its
dissolution
she
was
too
innocent
of
such
a
thought
perhaps
too
much
absorbed
by
her
own
purpose
to
catch
the
hint
of
unjust
reproach
well
then
she
said
with
a
desperate
effort
in
a
voice
that
trembled
between
the
fear
of
offending
by
presumption
or
exaction
and
the
desire
to
give
utterance
to
her
wish
i
want
will
you
say
that
if
by
that
time
you
do
not
think
that
i
have
been
too
faulty
too
undeserving
that
i
shall
go
with
you
when
you
quit
this
world
and
her
eagerness
at
last
overpowering
her
shyness
she
looked
up
anxiously
into
my
face
we
wholly
misconceived
each
other
she
drooped
in
bitter
disappointment
mistaking
my
blank
surprise
for
displeasure
her
words
brought
over
my
mind
a
rush
of
that
horror
with
which
i
ever
recall
the
scenes
i
witnessed
but
too
often
at
indian
funerals
that
of
course
will
rest
with
yourself
but
even
should
i
hereafter
deserve
and
win
such
love
as
would
prompt
the
wish
i
trust
you
will
never
dream
of
cutting
short
your
life
because
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
mine
should
end
long
before
the
term
of
yours
her
face
again
brightened
and
she
looked
up
more
shyly
but
not
less
earnestly
i
did
not
make
my
meaning
clear
she
replied
i
spoke
not
as
my
father
sometimes
speaks
of
leaving
this
world
when
he
means
to
remind
us
that
death
is
only
a
departure
to
another
though
that
was
not
so
long
ago
the
only
meaning
the
words
could
bear
i
was
thinking
of
your
journey
and
i
want
you
to
take
me
with
you
when
you
go
you
have
quite
settled
in
your
own
mind
that
i
shall
go
and
in
truth
you
have
now
removed
as
you
yesterday
created
the
only
obstacle
if
you
would
not
go
with
me
i
might
rather
than
give
you
up
have
given
up
the
whole
purpose
of
my
enterprise
and
have
left
my
friends
and
the
world
from
which
i
came
ignorant
whether
it
had
ever
been
accomplished
but
if
you
accompany
me
i
shall
certainly
try
to
regain
my
own
planet
then
she
said
hopefully
but
half
confidently
when
you
go
if
i
have
not
given
you
cause
of
lasting
displeasure
you
take
me
with
you
most
men
do
not
think
much
of
promises
especially
of
promises
made
to
women
but
i
have
heard
you
speak
as
if
to
break
a
plighted
word
were
a
thing
impossible
i
promise
i
returned
earnestly
very
much
moved
by
a
proof
of
real
affection
such
as
i
had
no
right
to
expect
and
certainly
had
not
anticipated
i
give
you
the
word
of
one
who
has
never
lied
that
if
when
the
time
comes
you
wish
to
go
with
me
you
shall
but
by
that
time
you
will
probably
have
a
better
idea
what
are
the
dangers
you
are
asking
to
share
what
can
that
matter
she
answered
i
suppose
in
almost
any
case
we
should
escape
or
die
together
to
leave
me
here
is
to
inflict
certainly
and
at
once
the
worst
that
can
possibly
befall
me
to
take
me
gives
me
the
hope
of
living
or
dying
with
you
and
even
if
i
were
killed
i
should
be
with
you
and
feel
that
you
were
kind
to
me
to
the
last
i
little
thought
said
i
hesitating
long
for
some
expression
of
tenderness
which
the
language
of
mars
refuses
to
furnish
i
little
thought
to
find
in
a
world
of
which
selfishness
seems
to
be
the
paramount
principle
and
the
absence
of
real
love
even
between
man
and
woman
the
most
prevalent
characteristic
a
wife
so
true
to
the
best
and
deepest
meaning
of
wedlock
still
less
could
i
have
hoped
to
find
such
a
wife
in
one
who
had
scarcely
spoken
to
me
hours
before
our
marriage
if
my
unexampled
adventure
had
had
no
other
reward
if
i
had
cared
nothing
for
the
triumph
of
discovering
a
new
world
with
all
its
wonders
eveena
this
discovery
alone
is
reward
in
full
for
all
my
studies
toils
and
perils
for
all
i
have
done
and
risked
already
for
all
the
risks
of
the
future
i
am
tenfold
repaid
in
winning
you
she
looked
up
at
these
words
with
an
expression
in
which
there
was
more
of
bewilderment
and
incredulity
than
of
satisfaction
evidently
touched
by
the
earnestness
of
my
tone
but
scarcely
understanding
my
words
better
than
if
i
had
spoken
in
my
own
tongue
it
would
not
be
worth
while
to
record
the
next
hour
conversation
i
would
only
note
the
strong
and
painful
impression
it
left
upon
my
mind
there
was
in
eveena
language
and
demeanour
a
timidity
a
sort
of
tentative
fearful
venturing
as
on
dangerous
ground
feeling
her
way
as
it
were
in
almost
every
sentence
which
could
not
be
wholly
attributed
to
the
shyness
of
a
very
young
and
very
suddenly
wedded
bride
there
was
enough
and
to
spare
of
this
shyness
but
more
of
the
sheer
physical
or
nervous
fear
of
a
child
suddenly
left
in
hands
whose
reputed
severity
has
thoroughly
frightened
her
not
daring
to
give
offence
by
silence
but
afraid
at
each
word
to
give
yet
more
fatal
offence
in
speaking
longer
experience
of
a
world
in
which
even
the
first
passion
of
love
is
devoid
of
tenderness
in
which
asserted
equality
has
long
since
deprived
women
of
that
claim
to
indulgence
which
can
only
rest
on
acknowledged
weakness
taught
me
but
too
well
the
meaning
of
this
fearful
trembling
anxiety
to
please
or
rather
not
to
offend
i
suppose
that
even
a
brutal
master
hardly
likes
to
see
a
child
cower
in
his
presence
as
if
constantly
expecting
a
blow
and
this
cowering
was
so
evident
in
my
bride
demeanour
that
after
trying
for
a
couple
of
hours
to
coax
her
into
confidence
and
unreserved
feminine
fluency
i
began
to
feel
almost
impatient
it
was
fortunate
that
just
as
my
tone
involuntarily
betrayed
to
her
quick
and
watchful
ear
some
shade
of
annoyance
just
as
i
caught
a
furtive
upward
glance
that
seemed
to
ask
what
error
she
had
committed
and
how
it
might
be
repaired
a
scratching
on
the
door
startled
her
she
did
not
however
venture
to
disengage
herself
from
the
hand
which
now
held
her
own
but
only
moved
aside
with
a
slight
questioning
look
and
gesture
as
if
tacitly
asking
to
be
released
as
i
still
held
her
fast
she
was
silent
till
the
unnoticed
scratching
had
been
two
or
three
times
repeated
and
then
shall
i
tell
them
to
come
in
when
i
released
her
there
appeared
to
my
surprise
at
her
call
no
human
intruder
but
one
of
the
ambau
bearing
on
a
tray
a
goblet
which
as
he
placed
it
on
a
table
beside
us
i
perceived
to
contain
a
liquid
rather
different
from
any
yet
offered
me
the
presence
of
these
mute
servants
is
generally
no
more
heeded
than
that
of
our
cats
and
dogs
but
i
now
learnt
that
martial
ideas
of
delicacy
forbid
them
even
as
human
servants
would
be
forbidden
to
intrude
unannounced
on
conjugal
privacy
when
the
little
creature
had
departed
i
tasted
the
liquid
but
its
flavour
was
so
unpleasant
that
i
set
down
the
vessel
immediately
eveena
however
took
it
up
and
drinking
a
part
of
it
with
an
effort
to
control
the
grimace
of
dislike
it
provoked
held
it
up
to
me
again
so
evidently
expecting
and
inviting
me
to
share
it
that
courtesy
permitted
no
further
demur
a
second
sign
or
look
when
i
set
it
down
unemptied
induced
me
to
finish
the
draught
regarding
the
matter
as
some
trivial
but
indispensable
ceremonial
i
took
no
further
notice
of
it
but
thankful
for
the
diversion
it
had
given
to
my
thoughts
continued
my
endeavours
to
soothe
and
encourage
my
fair
companion
after
a
few
minutes
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
somewhat
suddenly
gaining
courage
and
confidence
at
the
same
time
i
myself
became
aware
of
a
mental
effect
which
i
promptly
ascribed
to
the
draught
nor
was
i
wrong
it
contained
one
of
those
drugs
which
i
have
mentioned
so
rarely
used
in
this
house
that
i
had
never
before
seen
or
tasted
any
of
them
but
given
as
matter
of
course
on
any
occasion
that
is
supposed
to
involve
unusual
agitation
or
make
an
exceptional
call
on
nerves
or
spirits
but
for
the
influence
of
this
cup
i
should
still
have
withheld
the
remark
which
nevertheless
i
had
resolved
to
make
as
soon
as
i
could
hope
to
do
so
without
annoying
or
alarming
eveena
are
you
afraid
of
me
i
asked
somewhat
abruptly
the
question
may
have
startled
her
but
i
was
more
startled
by
the
answer
of
course
she
said
in
a
tone
which
would
have
been
absolutely
matter
of
fact
except
that
the
doubt
evidently
surprised
her
ought
i
not
to
be
so
but
what
made
you
ask
and
what
had
i
done
to
displease
you
just
before
they
sent
us
the
cup
i
did
not
mean
to
show
anything
like
displeasure
i
replied
but
i
was
thinking
then
and
i
may
tell
you
now
that
you
remind
me
not
of
the
women
of
my
own
earth
but
of
petted
children
suddenly
transferred
to
a
harsh
school
you
speak
and
look
like
such
a
child
as
if
you
expected
each
moment
at
least
to
be
severely
scolded
if
not
beaten
without
knowing
your
fault
not
yet
she
murmured
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
me
more
painful
than
tears
would
have
been
but
please
do
speak
as
if
i
should
fear
anything
so
much
as
being
scolded
by
you
we
have
a
saying
that
hand
may
bruise
the
skin
the
tongue
can
break
the
heart
true
enough
i
said
only
on
earth
it
is
mostly
woman
tongue
that
breaks
the
heart
and
men
must
not
in
return
bruise
the
skin
why
not
she
asked
you
said
to
my
mother
the
other
day
that
argâ
the
fretful
child
of
esmo
adoption
deserved
to
be
beaten
women
are
supposed
i
answered
to
be
amenable
to
milder
influences
and
a
man
must
be
drunk
or
utterly
brutal
before
he
could
deal
harshly
with
a
creature
so
gentle
and
so
fragile
as
yourself
do
spoil
me
she
said
with
a
pretty
glance
petted
bride
makes
an
unhappy
wife
surely
it
is
no
true
kindness
to
tempt
us
to
count
on
an
indulgence
that
can
not
last
there
is
among
us
i
rejoined
a
saying
about
a
butterfly
on
the
wheel
as
if
one
spoke
of
driving
away
the
tiny
birds
that
nestle
and
feed
in
your
flowers
with
a
hammer
to
apply
your
proverbs
to
yourself
would
be
to
realise
this
proverb
of
ours
can
you
not
let
me
pet
and
spoil
my
little
at
least
till
i
have
tamed
her
and
trust
me
to
chastise
her
as
soon
as
she
shall
give
reason
if
i
can
find
a
tendril
or
light
enough
for
the
purpose
will
you
promise
to
use
a
hammer
when
you
wish
to
be
rid
of
her
said
she
glancing
up
for
one
moment
through
her
drooping
lashes
with
a
look
exactly
attuned
to
the
mingled
archness
and
pathos
of
her
tone
chapter
xi
a
country
drive
like
all
martialists
i
had
been
accustomed
since
my
landing
to
wake
with
the
first
light
of
dawn
but
the
draught
though
its
earlier
effects
were
anything
but
narcotic
or
stupifying
deepened
and
prolonged
my
sleep
it
was
not
till
the
rays
of
sunlight
came
clear
and
full
through
the
crystal
roof
of
the
peristyle
and
the
window
of
our
bridal
chamber
that
my
eyes
unclosed
the
first
object
on
which
they
opened
startled
me
into
full
waking
recollection
exactly
where
the
sunbeams
fell
just
within
reach
of
my
hand
eveena
stood
the
loveliest
creature
i
ever
beheld
a
miniature
type
of
faultless
feminine
grace
and
beauty
by
the
standard
of
terrestrial
humanity
she
was
tiny
rather
than
small
so
light
so
perfect
in
proportion
form
and
features
so
absolutely
beautiful
so
exquisitely
delicate
as
to
suggest
the
ideal
fairy
queen
realised
in
flesh
and
blood
rather
than
any
properly
human
loveliness
in
the
transparent
delicacy
of
a
complexion
resembling
that
of
an
infant
child
of
the
fairest
and
most
tenderly
nurtured
among
the
finest
races
of
europe
in
the
ideally
perfect
outline
of
face
and
features
the
noble
but
even
forehead
the
smooth
straight
clearly
pencilled
eyebrows
the
large
eyes
and
drooping
lids
with
their
long
dark
soft
fringe
the
little
mouth
and
small
white
even
regular
teeth
the
rosy
lips
slightly
compressed
save
when
parted
in
speech
smile
or
eager
attention
she
exhibited
in
their
most
perfect
but
by
no
means
fullest
development
the
characteristics
of
martial
physiognomy
or
rather
the
characteristic
beauty
of
a
family
in
which
the
finest
traits
of
that
physiognomy
are
unmixed
with
any
of
its
meaner
or
harsher
peculiarities
the
hands
long
slight
and
soft
the
unsandalled
feet
not
less
perfectly
shaped
could
only
have
belonged
to
the
child
of
ancestors
who
for
more
than
a
hundred
generations
have
never
known
hard
manual
toil
rough
exposure
or
deforming
cramping
costume
even
as
every
detail
of
her
beauty
bore
witness
to
an
immemorial
inheritance
of
health
unbroken
by
physical
infirmity
undisturbed
by
violent
passions
and
developed
by
an
admirable
system
of
physical
and
mental
discipline
and
culture
the
absence
of
veil
and
sleeves
left
visible
the
soft
rounded
arms
and
shoulders
in
whose
complexion
a
tinge
of
pale
rose
seemed
to
shine
through
a
skin
itself
of
translucent
white
the
small
head
and
the
perfection
of
the
slender
neck
with
the
smooth
unbroken
curve
from
the
ear
to
the
arm
her
long
hair
fastened
only
by
a
silver
band
woven
in
and
out
behind
the
small
rounded
ears
fell
almost
to
her
knee
and
as
it
caught
the
bright
rays
of
the
morning
sun
i
discerned
for
the
first
time
the
full
beauty
of
that
tinge
of
gold
which
varied
the
colour
of
the
rich
soft
brown
tresses
as
her
sex
are
seldom
exposed
to
the
cold
of
the
night
or
the
mists
their
underclothing
is
slight
and
close
fitting
eveena
thin
robe
of
the
simplest
possible
form
two
wide
straight
pieces
of
a
material
lustrous
as
satin
but
rivalling
the
finest
cambric
in
texture
lined
with
the
same
fabric
reversed
sewn
together
from
the
hem
of
the
skirt
to
the
arm
and
fastened
again
by
the
shoulder
clasps
fell
perfectly
loose
save
where
compressed
by
the
zone
or
by
the
movements
of
the
wearer
and
where
so
compressed
defined
the
outlines
of
the
form
as
distinctly
as
the
lightest
wet
drapery
of
the
studio
her
dress
in
short
achieved
in
its
pure
simplicity
all
at
which
the
artistic
skill
of
matrons
milliners
and
maidens
aims
in
a
parisian
ball
costume
without
a
shadow
of
that
suggestive
immodesty
from
which
ball
costumes
are
seldom
wholly
free
exactly
reversing
terrestrial
practice
a
martial
wife
reserves
for
strictest
domestic
privacy
that
undressed
that
frank
revelation
of
her
beauty
which
the
matrons
of
london
paris
or
new
york
think
exclusively
appropriate
to
the
most
public
occasions
till
now
while
still
enjoying
the
liberty
allowed
to
maidens
in
this
respect
eveena
by
the
arrangement
of
her
veil
had
always
given
to
her
costume
a
reserve
wholly
unexceptionable
even
according
to
the
rules
enforced
by
the
customs
of
western
europe
on
young
girls
not
yet
presented
in
the
marriage
market
of
society
a
new
expression
or
one
at
least
which
i
had
never
before
seen
there
gave
to
her
face
a
strange
and
novel
beauty
the
beauty
i
wish
to
think
of
shy
but
true
happiness
felt
it
may
be
for
the
first
time
and
softened
i
fear
by
a
doubt
of
its
possible
endurance
which
rendered
it
as
touching
as
attractive
never
was
the
sleep
even
of
the
poet
of
the
night
visited
by
a
lovelier
vision
especially
lovely
as
the
soft
rose
blush
suffused
her
cheeks
under
my
gaze
of
admiration
and
delight
springing
up
i
caught
her
with
both
hands
and
drew
her
on
my
knee
some
minutes
passed
before
either
of
us
cared
to
speak
probably
as
she
rested
her
head
on
my
arm
and
looked
into
my
eyes
each
read
the
other
character
more
truly
and
clearly
than
words
the
most
frank
and
open
could
ever
enable
us
to
do
i
had
taught
her
last
night
a
few
substitutes
in
the
softest
tongue
i
knew
for
those
words
of
natural
tenderness
in
which
her
language
is
signally
deficient
taught
her
to
understand
them
certainly
not
to
use
them
for
it
was
long
before
i
could
even
induce
her
to
address
me
by
name
my
father
bade
me
yesterday
she
said
at
last
ask
you
in
future
to
wear
the
dress
of
our
people
not
that
you
will
be
the
less
an
object
of
attention
and
wonder
but
that
in
retaining
a
distinction
which
depends
entirely
on
your
own
choice
you
will
seem
intentionally
to
prefer
your
own
habits
to
ours
i
comply
of
course
i
observed
naturally
the
dress
of
every
country
is
best
suited
to
its
own
conditions
yet
i
should
have
thought
that
a
preference
for
my
own
world
even
were
it
wholly
irrational
might
seem
at
least
natural
and
pardonable
people
do
she
answered
simply
like
any
sign
of
individual
fancy
or
opinion
they
do
like
any
one
to
show
that
he
thinks
them
wrong
even
on
a
matter
of
taste
i
fear
then
that
i
must
be
content
with
unpopularity
i
may
wear
the
costume
of
your
people
but
their
thought
their
conduct
their
inner
and
outer
life
as
your
father
reports
them
and
as
thus
far
i
have
seen
them
are
to
me
so
unnatural
that
the
more
i
resemble
them
externally
the
more
my
unlikeness
in
all
else
is
likely
to
attract
notice
i
am
sorry
for
this
because
women
are
by
nature
prone
to
judge
even
their
nearest
and
dearest
by
the
standard
of
fashion
and
to
exact
from
men
almost
as
close
a
conformity
to
that
standard
as
they
themselves
display
i
fear
you
will
have
to
forgive
many
heresies
in
my
conduct
as
well
as
in
my
thoughts
you
can
not
suppose
she
answered
earnestly
she
seemed
incapable
of
apprehending
irony
or
jest
that
i
should
wish
you
more
like
others
than
you
are
whatever
may
happen
hereafter
i
shall
always
feel
myself
the
happiest
of
women
in
having
belonged
to
one
who
cares
for
something
beside
himself
and
holds
even
life
cheaper
than
love
i
hope
so
but
in
that
matter
there
was
scarcely
more
of
love
than
of
choice
what
i
did
for
you
i
must
have
done
no
less
for
zevle
her
sister
if
i
had
feared
death
as
much
as
the
regent
does
i
could
not
have
returned
alive
and
alone
my
venture
into
infinite
space
involved
possibilities
of
horror
more
appalling
than
the
mere
terrors
of
death
you
asked
of
me
as
my
one
bridal
gift
leave
to
share
its
perils
how
unworthy
of
you
should
i
be
if
i
did
not
hold
the
possession
of
eveena
even
for
the
two
years
of
her
promise
well
worth
dying
for
the
moral
gulf
between
the
two
worlds
is
wider
than
the
material
utterly
unselfish
and
trustful
eveena
was
almost
pained
to
be
reminded
that
the
service
she
so
extravagantly
overprized
was
rendered
to
her
sex
rather
than
herself
while
yet
more
deeply
gratified
though
still
half
incredulous
by
the
commonplace
that
preferred
love
to
life
i
had
yet
to
learn
however
that
eveena
nature
was
as
utterly
strange
in
her
own
world
as
the
ideas
in
which
she
was
educated
would
seem
in
mine
i
left
her
for
a
few
minutes
to
dress
for
the
first
time
in
the
costume
which
esmo
care
had
provided
the
single
of
softest
hide
closely
fitting
from
neck
to
knees
is
of
all
garments
the
best
adapted
to
preserve
natural
warmth
under
the
rapid
and
extreme
changes
of
the
external
atmosphere
the
outer
garb
consisted
of
blouse
and
trousers
woven
of
a
fabric
in
which
a
fine
warp
of
metallic
lustre
was
crossed
by
a
strong
silken
weft
giving
the
effect
of
a
diapered
scarlet
and
silver
both
fastened
by
the
belt
a
broad
green
strap
of
some
species
of
leather
clasped
with
gold
masculine
dress
is
seldom
brilliant
as
is
that
of
the
women
but
convenient
and
comfortable
beyond
any
other
and
generally
handsome
and
elegant
the
one
part
of
the
costume
which
i
could
never
approve
is
the
sandal
which
leaves
the
feet
exposed
to
dust
and
cold
rejoining
my
bride
i
said
i
have
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
much
of
this
country
and
i
fancy
from
what
i
have
seen
of
feminine
seclusion
that
an
excursion
would
be
as
much
a
holiday
treat
to
you
as
to
myself
if
your
father
will
lend
us
his
carriage
would
you
like
to
accompany
me
to
one
or
two
places
kevimâ
has
described
not
far
from
this
and
which
i
am
anxious
to
visit
she
bent
her
head
but
did
not
answer
and
fancying
that
the
proposal
was
not
agreeable
to
her
i
added
if
you
prefer
to
spend
our
little
remaining
time
here
with
your
mother
and
sister
i
will
ask
your
brother
to
accompany
me
though
i
am
selfishly
unwilling
to
part
with
you
she
looked
up
for
a
moment
with
an
air
of
pain
and
perplexity
and
as
she
turned
away
i
saw
the
tears
gather
in
her
eyes
what
the
matter
i
asked
surprised
and
puzzled
as
one
on
earth
who
tries
to
please
a
woman
by
offering
her
her
own
way
and
finds
that
so
offered
it
is
the
last
thing
she
cares
to
have
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
even
in
trifles
a
martial
wife
never
dreams
that
her
taste
or
wish
can
signify
or
be
consulted
where
her
lord
has
a
preference
of
his
own
to
invite
instead
of
commanding
her
companionship
was
unusual
to
withdraw
the
expression
of
my
own
wish
and
bid
her
decide
for
herself
was
in
eveena
eyes
to
mark
formally
and
deliberately
that
i
did
not
care
for
her
society
what
have
i
done
she
faltered
to
be
so
punished
i
have
not
save
the
day
before
yesterday
left
the
house
this
year
and
you
offer
me
the
greatest
of
pleasures
only
to
snatch
it
away
the
next
moment
nay
eveena
i
answered
if
i
had
not
told
you
you
must
know
that
i
can
not
but
wish
for
your
company
but
by
your
silence
i
fancied
you
disliked
my
proposal
yet
did
not
like
to
decline
it
the
expression
of
surprise
and
perplexity
in
her
face
though
half
pathetic
seemed
so
comical
that
i
with
difficulty
suppressed
a
laugh
because
for
her
it
was
evidently
no
laughing
matter
after
giving
her
time
as
i
thought
to
recover
herself
i
said
well
i
suppose
we
may
now
join
them
at
the
morning
meal
something
was
still
wrong
the
clue
to
which
i
gathered
by
observing
her
shy
glance
at
her
and
veil
must
you
wear
those
i
asked
a
question
which
gave
her
some
such
imperfect
clue
to
my
thoughts
as
i
had
found
to
hers
how
foolish
of
me
she
said
smiling
to
forget
how
little
you
can
know
of
our
customs
of
course
i
must
wear
my
veil
and
sleeves
but
you
must
put
on
the
veil
as
you
removed
it
last
night
the
awkwardness
with
which
i
performed
this
duty
had
its
effect
in
amusing
and
cheering
her
and
the
look
of
happiness
and
trust
had
come
back
to
her
countenance
before
the
veil
concealed
it
i
made
my
request
to
esmo
who
answered
with
some
amusement
every
house
like
ours
has
from
six
to
a
dozen
larger
or
lighter
carriages
of
course
they
cost
nothing
save
the
original
purchase
they
last
for
half
a
lifetime
and
are
not
costly
at
the
outset
but
i
have
news
for
you
which
i
venture
to
think
will
be
as
little
agreeable
to
you
as
to
ourselves
your
journey
must
begin
tomorrow
and
this
therefore
is
the
only
opportunity
you
will
have
for
such
an
excursion
as
you
propose
then
i
said
will
eveena
still
wish
to
share
it
even
her
mother
face
seemed
to
ask
what
in
the
world
that
could
matter
but
a
movement
of
the
daughter
veiled
head
reminded
me
that
i
was
blundering
and
pressing
her
little
hand
as
she
lay
beside
me
i
took
her
compliance
for
granted
the
morning
mist
had
given
place
to
hot
bright
sunshine
when
we
started
at
first
our
road
lay
between
enclosures
like
that
which
surrounded
esmo
dwelling
presently
the
lines
were
broken
here
and
there
by
such
fields
as
i
had
seen
in
descending
from
asnyca
some
filled
with
crops
of
human
food
some
with
artificial
pastures
in
which
unicorns
or
other
creatures
were
feeding
i
saw
also
more
than
one
field
wherein
the
were
weeding
or
gathering
fruit
piling
their
burdens
in
either
case
as
soon
as
their
beaks
were
full
into
bags
or
baskets
pointing
out
to
eveena
the
striking
difference
of
colour
between
the
cultivated
fields
and
gardens
and
the
woods
or
natural
meadows
on
the
mountain
sides
i
learned
from
her
that
this
distinction
is
everywhere
perceptible
in
mars
natural
objects
plants
or
animals
rocks
and
soil
are
for
the
most
part
of
dimmer
fainter
or
darker
tints
than
on
earth
probably
owing
to
the
much
less
intense
light
of
the
sun
partly
perhaps
to
that
absorption
of
the
blue
rays
by
the
atmosphere
which
diminishes
i
suppose
even
that
light
which
actually
reaches
the
planet
but
uncultivated
ground
except
on
the
mountains
above
the
ordinary
range
of
crops
or
pastures
scarcely
exists
in
the
belt
of
equatorial
continents
the
turf
itself
like
the
herbage
or
fruit
shrubs
in
the
fields
is
artificial
consisting
of
plants
developed
through
long
ages
into
forms
utterly
unlike
the
native
original
by
the
skill
and
ingenuity
of
man
even
the
great
fruit
trees
have
undergone
material
change
not
only
in
the
size
flavour
and
appearance
of
the
fruits
themselves
which
have
been
the
immediate
object
of
care
but
probably
through
some
natural
correlation
between
the
different
organs
in
the
form
and
colour
of
the
foliage
the
arrangement
of
the
branches
and
the
growth
of
the
trunk
all
of
which
are
much
more
regular
and
so
to
speak
more
perfect
than
is
the
case
either
here
or
on
earth
with
those
left
to
the
control
of
nature
and
locality
or
the
effects
of
the
natural
competition
which
is
in
its
way
perhaps
as
keen
among
plants
and
animals
as
among
men
martialists
have
the
same
delight
in
bright
colours
as
orientals
with
far
greater
taste
in
selection
and
combination
and
the
favourite
hues
not
only
of
their
flowers
tame
birds
fishes
and
quadrupeds
but
of
plants
in
whose
cultivation
utility
has
been
the
primary
object
contrast
signally
as
i
have
said
with
the
dull
tints
of
the
undomesticated
flora
and
fauna
of
which
comparatively
scanty
remnants
were
visible
here
and
there
in
this
rich
country
presently
we
came
within
sight
of
the
river
over
which
was
a
single
bridge
formed
by
what
might
be
called
a
tube
of
metal
built
into
strong
walls
on
either
bank
in
fact
however
the
sides
were
of
open
work
and
only
the
roof
and
floor
were
solid
the
river
at
this
its
narrowest
point
was
perhaps
a
furlong
in
breadth
and
it
was
not
without
instinctive
uneasiness
that
i
trusted
to
the
security
of
a
single
piece
of
metal
spanning
without
even
the
strength
afforded
by
the
form
of
the
arch
so
great
a
space
the
first
object
we
were
to
visit
lay
at
some
distance
down
the
stream
as
we
approached
the
point
we
passed
a
place
where
the
river
widened
considerably
the
main
channel
in
the
centre
was
kept
clear
and
deep
to
afford
an
uninterrupted
course
for
navigation
but
on
either
side
were
rocks
that
broke
the
river
into
pools
and
shallows
such
as
here
no
less
than
on
earth
form
the
favourite
haunts
or
spawning
places
of
the
fish
in
some
of
the
lesser
pools
birds
larger
than
the
stork
bearing
under
the
throat
an
expansible
bag
like
that
of
the
pelican
were
seeking
for
prey
they
were
watched
and
directed
by
a
master
on
the
shore
and
carried
to
a
square
tank
fixed
on
a
wheeled
frame
not
unlike
that
of
the
ordinary
carriage
which
accompanied
him
each
fish
they
took
i
observed
that
the
latter
were
carefully
seized
with
the
least
possible
violence
or
injury
placed
by
a
jerk
in
the
which
though
when
empty
it
was
scarcely
perceptible
would
contain
prey
of
very
considerable
size
and
weight
and
as
carefully
disgorged
into
the
tank
in
one
of
the
most
extensive
pools
too
deep
for
these
birds
a
couple
of
men
had
spread
a
sort
of
net
not
unlike
those
used
on
earth
but
formed
of
twisted
metal
threads
with
very
narrow
meshes
enclosing
the
whole
pool
a
space
of
perhaps
some
square
yards
in
the
centre
of
this
an
electric
lamp
was
let
down
into
the
water
some
feet
below
the
surface
the
fish
crowded
towards
it
and
a
sudden
shock
of
electricity
transmitted
through
the
meshes
of
the
net
as
well
as
from
the
wires
of
the
lamp
circuit
stunned
for
a
few
minutes
all
life
within
the
enclosure
the
fish
then
floated
on
the
surface
the
net
was
drawn
together
and
they
were
collected
and
sorted
some
which
as
i
afterwards
learned
were
required
for
breeding
being
carefully
and
separately
preserved
in
a
smaller
tank
those
fit
for
food
cast
into
the
larger
one
those
too
small
for
the
one
purpose
and
not
needed
for
the
other
being
thrown
back
into
the
water
i
noted
however
that
many
fish
apparently
valuable
were
among
those
thus
rejected
i
spoke
to
one
of
the
fishermen
who
regarding
me
with
great
surprise
and
curiosity
at
last
answered
briefly
that
a
stringent
law
forbids
the
catching
of
spawning
fish
except
for
breeding
purposes
those
therefore
for
which
the
season
was
were
invariably
spared
in
a
much
larger
net
sometimes
enclosing
more
than
square
yards
is
employed
this
fishing
is
conducted
chiefly
at
night
the
electric
lamp
being
then
much
more
effective
in
attracting
the
prey
and
lowered
only
a
few
inches
below
the
surface
many
large
destructive
creatures
unfit
for
food
generally
of
a
nature
intermediate
between
fish
and
reptiles
haunt
the
seas
it
is
held
unwise
to
exterminate
them
since
they
do
their
part
in
keeping
down
an
immense
variety
of
smaller
creatures
noxious
for
one
reason
or
another
and
also
in
clearing
the
water
from
carrion
and
masses
of
seaweed
which
might
otherwise
taint
the
air
of
the
especially
near
the
mouths
of
large
tropical
rivers
but
these
devour
enormous
quantities
of
fish
and
the
hunters
appointed
to
deal
with
them
are
instructed
to
limit
their
numbers
to
the
minimum
required
their
average
increase
is
to
be
destroyed
each
year
if
at
any
time
it
appear
that
for
whatever
cause
the
total
number
left
alive
is
falling
off
the
chief
of
this
service
suspends
it
partially
or
wholly
at
his
discretion
we
now
came
to
the
entrance
of
a
vast
enclosure
bordering
on
the
river
the
greatest
establishment
on
this
continent
or
indeed
in
this
world
one
of
its
managers
courteously
showed
me
over
it
it
is
not
necessary
minutely
to
describe
its
arrangements
from
the
spawning
ponds
and
the
hatching
tanks
the
latter
contained
in
a
huge
building
whose
temperature
is
preserved
with
the
utmost
care
at
the
rate
found
best
suited
to
the
ova
to
the
multitude
of
streams
ponds
and
lakes
in
which
the
different
kinds
of
fish
are
kept
during
the
several
stages
of
their
existence
the
task
of
the
breeders
is
much
facilitated
by
the
fact
that
the
seas
of
mars
are
not
like
ours
salt
and
though
sea
and
river
fish
are
almost
as
distinct
as
on
earth
each
kind
having
its
own
habitat
whose
conditions
are
carefully
reproduced
in
the
breeding
or
feeding
reservoirs
the
same
kind
of
water
suits
all
alike
it
is
necessary
however
to
keep
the
fishes
of
tropical
seas
and
streams
in
water
of
a
very
different
temperature
from
that
suited
to
others
brought
from
arctic
or
climates
and
this
like
every
other
point
affecting
the
natural
peculiarities
and
habits
of
the
fish
is
attended
to
with
minute
and
accurate
care
the
skill
and
science
brought
to
bear
on
the
task
of
breeding
accomplish
this
and
much
more
difficult
operations
with
marvellous
ease
and
certainty
on
one
of
the
buildings
i
observed
one
of
the
most
remarkable
largest
and
most
complete
timepieces
i
had
yet
seen
and
i
had
on
this
occasion
an
opportunity
of
examining
it
closely
the
dial
was
oblong
enclosed
in
a
case
of
clear
transparent
crystal
somewhat
resembling
in
form
the
open
portion
of
a
mercurial
barometer
at
the
top
were
three
circles
of
different
colours
divided
by
twelve
equidistant
lines
radiating
from
the
centres
and
subdivided
again
and
again
by
the
same
number
exactly
at
the
uppermost
point
of
each
was
a
golden
indicator
one
of
these
circles
marked
the
temperature
graduated
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
degree
ever
known
in
that
latitude
another
indicated
the
direction
of
the
wind
while
the
depth
of
colour
in
the
circle
itself
graduated
in
a
manner
carefully
explained
to
me
but
my
notes
of
which
are
lost
showed
the
exact
force
of
the
atmospheric
current
the
third
served
the
purpose
of
a
barometer
a
coloured
band
immediately
below
indicated
by
the
variations
of
tint
the
character
of
the
coming
weather
this
band
stretched
right
across
the
face
below
it
were
figures
indicating
the
day
of
the
year
the
central
portion
of
the
face
was
occupied
by
a
larger
circle
and
the
former
portion
representing
the
colour
of
the
daylight
sky
the
latter
emblematic
of
night
on
this
circle
the
sun
and
the
planets
were
represented
by
figures
whose
movement
showed
exactly
the
actual
place
of
each
in
the
celestial
sphere
the
two
moons
were
also
figured
their
phases
and
position
at
each
moment
being
accurately
presented
to
the
eye
around
this
circle
was
a
narrow
band
divided
into
strips
of
different
length
of
various
colours
each
representing
one
of
the
peculiar
divisions
of
the
martial
day
that
point
which
came
under
the
golden
indicator
showing
the
and
the
exact
moment
of
the
while
the
movement
of
the
inner
circle
fixed
with
equal
accuracy
the
period
of
day
or
night
below
were
other
circles
from
which
the
observer
could
learn
the
amount
of
moisture
in
the
atmosphere
the
intensity
of
the
sunlight
and
the
electric
tension
at
the
moment
each
of
the
six
smaller
circles
registered
on
a
moving
ribbon
the
indications
of
every
successive
moment
these
ribbons
when
unrolled
forming
a
perfect
record
of
temperature
atmospheric
pressure
wind
and
so
forth
in
the
form
of
a
curve
a
register
kept
for
more
than
martial
years
four
times
during
the
revolution
of
the
great
circle
each
large
clock
emits
for
a
couple
of
minutes
a
species
of
chime
the
nature
of
which
my
ignorance
of
music
renders
me
unable
to
describe
when
the
line
dividing
the
green
and
black
semicircles
is
horizontal
at
noon
and
midnight
and
an
hour
before
at
average
sunrise
and
sunset
it
becomes
perpendicular
the
individual
character
of
the
several
chimes
tunes
or
peals
whatever
they
should
be
called
is
so
distinct
that
even
i
appreciated
it
further
as
the
first
point
of
the
coloured
strip
distinguishing
each
several
reaches
the
golden
indicator
a
single
slightly
prolonged
sound
i
fancy
what
is
known
on
earth
as
a
single
chord
is
emitted
of
these
again
each
is
peculiar
so
that
no
one
with
an
ear
for
music
can
doubt
what
is
the
period
of
the
day
announced
the
sound
is
never
even
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
clock
unpleasantly
loud
while
it
penetrates
to
an
amazing
distance
it
would
be
perfectly
easy
if
needful
to
regulate
all
clocks
by
mechanical
control
through
the
electric
network
extended
all
over
the
face
of
the
planet
but
the
perfect
accuracy
of
each
individual
timepiece
renders
any
such
check
needless
in
those
latitudes
where
day
and
night
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
are
not
even
approximately
equal
the
black
and
green
semicircles
are
so
enlarged
or
diminished
by
mechanical
means
that
the
hour
of
the
day
or
night
is
represented
as
accurately
as
on
the
equator
itself
the
examination
of
this
establishment
occupied
us
for
two
or
three
hours
and
when
we
remounted
our
carriage
it
seemed
to
me
only
reasonable
that
eveena
should
be
weary
both
in
mind
and
body
i
proposed
therefore
to
return
at
once
but
against
this
she
earnestly
protested
well
i
said
we
will
finish
our
excursion
then
only
remember
that
whenever
you
do
feel
tired
you
must
tell
me
at
once
i
do
not
know
what
exertion
you
can
bear
and
of
course
it
would
be
most
inconsiderate
to
measure
your
endurance
by
my
own
she
promised
and
we
drove
on
for
another
hour
in
the
direction
of
a
range
of
hills
to
the
the
lower
and
nearer
portion
of
this
range
might
he
feet
above
the
general
level
of
the
plain
beyond
the
highest
peaks
rose
to
perhaps
feet
the
average
summit
being
about
half
that
height
where
our
road
brought
us
to
the
foot
of
the
first
slope
large
groves
of
the
whose
fruit
contains
a
sort
of
floury
pulp
like
roasted
potato
were
planted
on
ground
belonging
to
the
state
and
tenanted
by
young
men
belonging
to
that
minority
which
as
esmo
had
told
me
not
being
fortunate
enough
to
find
private
employment
is
thus
provided
for
encountering
one
of
these
he
pointed
out
to
us
the
narrow
road
which
winding
up
the
slope
afforded
means
of
bringing
down
in
waggons
during
the
two
harvest
seasons
each
of
which
lasts
for
about
fifty
days
the
fruit
of
these
groves
which
furnishes
a
principal
article
of
food
the
trees
do
not
reach
to
a
higher
level
than
about
feet
and
above
this
we
had
to
ascend
on
foot
by
a
path
winding
through
meadows
which
i
at
first
supposed
to
be
natural
eveena
however
quickly
undeceived
me
pointing
out
the
prevalence
of
certain
plants
peculiar
to
the
cultivated
pastures
we
had
seen
in
the
plain
these
were
so
predominant
as
to
leave
no
reasonable
doubt
that
they
had
been
originally
sown
by
the
hand
of
man
though
the
irregularity
of
their
arrangement
and
the
encroachment
of
one
species
upon
the
ground
of
another
enabled
my
companion
to
prove
to
me
with
equal
clearness
that
since
its
first
planting
the
pasture
had
been
entirely
neglected
it
was
she
thought
worth
planting
once
for
all
with
the
most
nutritious
herbage
but
not
worth
the
labour
of
subsequent
close
cultivation
any
lady
belonging
to
a
civilised
people
and
accustomed
to
a
country
life
upon
earth
might
easily
have
perceived
all
that
eveena
discovered
but
considering
how
seldom
the
latter
had
left
her
home
how
few
opportunities
she
had
to
see
anything
of
practical
agriculture
the
quickness
of
her
perception
and
the
correctness
of
her
inferences
not
a
little
surprised
me
the
path
we
pursued
led
directly
to
the
object
of
our
visit
the
waters
of
the
higher
hills
were
collected
in
a
vast
tank
excavated
in
an
extensive
plateau
at
the
at
the
summit
of
the
first
ascent
we
met
and
were
escorted
by
one
of
the
officials
entrusted
with
the
charge
of
these
works
which
supply
water
of
extraordinary
purity
to
a
population
of
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
million
inhabiting
a
district
of
some
square
miles
in
extent
the
tank
was
about
sixty
feet
in
depth
and
perhaps
a
mile
in
length
with
half
that
breadth
its
sides
and
lined
with
the
usual
concrete
our
guide
informed
me
that
in
many
cases
tanks
were
covered
with
the
crystal
employed
for
doors
and
windows
but
in
air
of
these
hills
such
a
precaution
was
thought
unnecessary
as
it
would
have
been
exceedingly
costly
the
water
itself
was
of
wonderful
purity
so
clear
that
the
smallest
object
at
the
bottom
was
visible
where
the
sun
still
high
in
the
heavens
shone
directly
upon
the
surface
but
this
purity
would
by
no
means
satisfy
the
standard
of
martial
sanitary
science
in
the
first
place
it
is
passed
into
a
second
division
of
the
tank
where
it
is
subjected
to
some
violent
electric
action
till
every
kind
of
organic
germ
it
may
contain
is
supposed
to
be
completely
destroyed
it
is
then
passed
through
several
covered
channels
and
mechanically
or
chemically
cleansed
from
every
kind
of
inorganic
impurity
and
finally
oxygenated
or
aerated
with
air
which
has
undergone
a
yet
more
elaborate
purification
at
every
stage
in
this
process
a
phial
of
water
is
taken
out
and
examined
in
a
dark
chamber
by
means
of
a
beam
of
light
emanating
from
a
powerful
electric
lamp
and
concentrated
by
a
huge
crystal
lens
if
this
beam
detect
any
perceptible
dust
or
matter
capable
of
scattering
the
light
the
water
is
pronounced
impure
and
passed
through
further
processes
only
when
the
contents
of
the
bottle
remain
absolutely
dark
in
the
midst
of
an
atmosphere
whose
floating
dust
renders
the
beam
visible
on
either
side
so
that
the
phial
while
perfectly
transparent
to
the
light
nevertheless
interrupts
the
beam
with
a
block
of
absolute
darkness
is
it
considered
fit
for
human
consumption
it
is
then
distributed
through
pipes
of
concrete
into
which
no
air
can
possibly
enter
to
cisterns
equally
in
every
house
the
water
in
these
is
periodically
examined
by
officers
from
the
waterworks
who
ascertain
that
it
has
contracted
no
impurity
either
in
the
course
of
its
passage
through
hundreds
of
miles
of
piping
or
in
the
cisterns
themselves
the
martialists
consider
that
to
this
careful
purification
of
their
water
they
owe
in
great
measure
their
exemption
from
the
epidemic
diseases
which
were
formerly
not
infrequent
they
maintain
that
all
such
diseases
are
caused
by
organic
germs
and
laugh
to
scorn
the
doctrine
of
spontaneous
generation
either
of
disease
or
of
even
such
low
organic
life
as
can
propagate
it
i
suggested
that
the
atmosphere
itself
must
if
their
theory
were
true
convey
the
microscopic
seeds
of
disease
even
more
freely
and
universally
than
the
water
doubtless
replied
our
guide
it
would
scatter
them
more
widely
but
it
does
not
enable
them
to
penetrate
and
germinate
in
the
body
half
so
easily
as
when
conveyed
by
water
you
must
be
aware
that
the
lining
of
the
upper
arrests
most
of
the
impurities
contained
in
the
inhaled
air
before
it
comes
into
contact
with
the
blood
in
the
lungs
themselves
moreover
the
extirpation
of
one
disease
after
another
the
careful
isolation
of
all
infectious
cases
and
the
destruction
of
every
article
that
could
preserve
or
convey
the
poisonous
germs
has
in
the
course
of
ages
enabled
us
utterly
to
destroy
them
this
did
not
seem
to
me
consistent
with
the
confession
that
disorders
of
one
kind
or
another
still
not
infrequently
decimate
their
domestic
animals
however
the
human
race
itself
may
have
been
secured
against
contagion
i
did
not
however
feel
competent
to
argue
the
question
with
one
who
had
evidently
studied
physiology
much
more
deeply
than
myself
and
had
mastered
the
records
of
an
experience
infinitely
longer
guided
by
knowledge
far
more
accurate
than
is
possessed
by
the
most
accomplished
of
terrestrial
physiologists
the
examination
of
these
works
of
course
occupied
us
for
a
long
time
and
obliged
us
to
traverse
several
miles
of
ground
more
than
once
i
had
suggested
to
eveena
that
we
should
leave
our
work
unfinished
and
on
every
opportunity
had
insisted
that
she
should
rest
i
had
been
too
keenly
interested
in
the
latter
part
of
the
explanation
given
me
to
detect
the
fatigue
she
anxiously
sought
to
conceal
but
when
we
left
the
works
i
was
more
annoyed
than
surprised
to
find
that
the
walk
to
our
carriage
was
too
much
for
her
the
vexation
i
felt
with
myself
gave
after
the
manner
of
men
some
sharpness
to
the
tone
of
my
remonstrance
with
her
i
bade
you
and
you
promised
to
tell
me
as
soon
as
you
felt
tired
and
you
have
let
me
almost
tire
you
to
death
your
obedience
however
strict
in
theory
reminds
me
in
practice
of
that
promised
by
women
on
earth
in
their
and
never
paid
or
remembered
afterwards
she
did
not
answer
and
finding
that
her
strength
was
utterly
exhausted
i
carried
her
down
the
remainder
of
the
hill
and
placed
her
in
the
carriage
during
our
return
neither
of
us
spoke
ascribing
her
silence
to
habit
or
fatigue
perhaps
to
displeasure
and
busied
in
recalling
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
i
did
not
care
to
make
conversation
as
i
certainly
should
have
done
had
i
guessed
what
impression
my
taciturnity
made
on
my
companion
mind
i
was
heartily
glad
for
her
sake
when
we
regained
the
gate
of
her
father
garden
committing
the
carriage
to
the
charge
of
an
ambâ
i
half
led
half
carried
eveena
along
the
avenue
overhung
with
the
grand
conical
bells
gold
crimson
scarlet
green
white
or
striped
or
variegated
with
some
or
all
these
colours
of
the
glorious
the
martial
convolvulus
its
light
clinging
stems
and
foliage
hid
the
arched
branches
overhead
and
formed
a
screen
on
either
side
from
its
bells
flew
at
our
approach
a
whole
flock
of
the
tiny
and
beautiful
caree
which
take
the
chief
part
in
rendering
to
the
flora
of
mars
such
services
as
the
flowers
of
earth
receive
from
bees
and
butterflies
they
feed
on
the
nectar
farina
syrup
and
other
secretions
sweet
or
bitter
in
which
the
artificial
flowers
of
mars
are
peculiarly
abundant
and
make
their
nests
in
the
calyx
or
among
the
petals
these
lovely
little
birds
about
the
size
of
a
hornet
but
perfect
birds
in
miniature
with
wings
as
large
as
those
of
the
largest
levantine
and
feathery
down
equally
fine
and
soft
are
perhaps
the
most
shy
and
timid
of
all
creatures
familiar
with
the
presence
of
martial
humanity
the
varied
colours
of
their
plumage
combined
and
intermingled
in
marvellously
minute
patterns
are
all
of
those
subdued
or
dead
tints
agreeable
to
the
taste
of
japanese
artists
and
perhaps
to
no
other
they
signally
contrast
the
vivid
and
splendid
colouring
of
objects
created
or
developed
by
human
genius
and
patience
from
the
exquisite
decorations
and
masses
of
domestic
and
public
architecture
to
the
magnificent
flowers
and
fruit
produced
by
the
labour
of
countless
generations
from
originals
so
dissimilar
that
only
the
records
of
past
ages
can
trace
or
the
searching
comparisons
of
science
recognise
them
i
am
told
that
the
present
race
of
themselves
are
a
sort
of
indirect
creation
of
art
they
certainly
vary
in
size
shape
and
colour
according
to
the
flower
each
exclusively
frequents
and
those
which
haunt
the
cultivated
bells
of
the
present
an
amazing
contrast
to
the
far
tinier
and
far
less
beautiful
which
have
not
yet
abandoned
the
wildflowers
for
those
of
the
garden
above
two
hundred
varieties
distinguished
by
ornithologists
frequent
only
the
domesticated
flowers
the
flight
of
this
swarm
of
various
beauty
recalled
the
conversation
of
last
night
and
breaking
off
unobserved
a
long
fine
tendril
of
the
leveloo
i
said
lightly
are
not
so
as
bambina
never
forgetting
a
word
of
mine
and
never
failing
to
catch
with
quick
intelligence
the
sense
of
the
most
epigrammatic
or
delicate
metaphor
eveena
started
and
looked
up
as
if
stung
by
a
serious
reproach
fancying
that
overpowering
fatigue
had
so
shaken
her
nerves
i
would
not
allow
her
to
speak
but
i
did
not
understand
how
much
she
had
been
distressed
till
in
her
own
chamber
cloak
and
veil
thrown
aside
she
stood
beside
my
seat
her
sleeveless
arms
folded
behind
her
drooping
like
a
lily
beaten
down
by
a
thunderstorm
then
she
murmured
sadly
i
did
not
think
of
offending
but
you
are
quite
right
disobedience
should
never
pass
certainly
not
i
replied
with
a
smile
she
did
not
see
taking
both
the
little
hands
in
my
left
i
laid
the
tendril
on
her
soft
white
shoulders
but
so
gently
that
in
her
real
distress
she
did
not
feel
the
touch
you
see
i
can
keep
my
word
but
never
let
me
tire
you
again
my
can
not
take
wing
if
she
anger
me
in
earnest
are
you
not
angered
now
she
asked
glancing
up
in
utter
surprise
my
eyes
or
the
sight
of
the
leveloo
answered
her
and
a
sweet
bright
smile
broke
through
her
look
of
frightened
penitent
submission
as
she
snatched
the
tendril
and
snapped
it
in
my
hand
cruel
she
said
with
a
pretty
assumption
of
to
visit
a
first
fault
with
the
whip
you
are
hard
to
please
bambina
i
knew
no
better
seriously
until
i
can
measure
your
strength
more
truly
never
again
let
me
feel
that
in
inviting
your
company
i
have
turned
my
pleasure
into
your
pain
no
indeed
she
urged
once
more
in
earnest
girls
so
seldom
pass
the
gate
and
men
never
walk
where
a
carriage
will
go
or
i
should
not
have
been
so
stupid
but
if
i
had
blistered
my
feet
and
the
leveloo
had
been
a
the
fruit
was
worth
the
scratches
what
do
you
know
my
child
either
of
blisters
or
stripes
you
will
teach
me
no
you
know
i
do
mean
that
but
you
will
take
me
with
you
sometimes
till
i
learn
better
if
you
are
going
to
leave
me
at
home
in
future
my
child
can
you
not
trust
me
to
take
you
for
my
own
pleasure
the
silvery
tone
of
her
low
sweet
laugh
was
truly
perfectly
musical
forgive
me
she
said
nestling
in
the
cushions
at
my
knee
and
seeking
with
upturned
eyes
like
a
child
better
assured
of
pardon
than
of
full
reconciliation
to
read
my
face
it
is
very
naughty
to
laugh
and
very
ungrateful
when
you
speak
to
please
me
but
is
it
real
kindness
to
say
what
i
should
be
very
silly
to
believe
you
will
believe
whatever
i
tell
you
child
if
you
wish
to
anger
a
man
even
with
you
tell
him
that
he
is
lying
i
do
nothing
but
misbehave
she
said
in
earnest
despondency
i
but
i
sealed
her
lips
effectually
for
the
moment
why
did
you
not
speak
as
we
came
home
you
were
tired
and
i
was
thinking
over
all
i
had
seen
besides
who
talks
air
makes
conversation
you
always
talk
when
you
are
pleased
the
scolding
and
silence
frightened
me
so
you
nearly
heard
me
crying
crying
for
fear
you
did
well
to
break
the
leveloo
and
so
you
think
i
must
be
tired
of
my
bride
before
the
colours
have
gone
round
on
the
dial
not
tired
of
her
you
will
like
a
little
longer
to
find
her
in
the
cushions
when
you
are
vexed
or
idle
but
you
do
want
her
where
her
ignorance
wearies
and
her
weakness
hampers
you
are
you
an
to
be
caged
at
home
and
played
with
for
lack
of
better
employment
we
shall
never
understand
each
other
child
what
more
can
i
be
but
do
say
we
shall
never
understand
each
other
she
pleaded
earnestly
it
took
time
and
trouble
to
make
my
pet
understand
and
obey
each
word
and
sign
zevle
gave
hers
more
slaps
and
fewer
sweets
and
it
learned
sooner
but
like
me
you
want
your
esve
to
be
happy
not
only
to
fly
straight
and
play
prettily
she
will
try
hard
to
learn
if
you
will
teach
her
and
not
be
so
afraid
of
hurting
her
as
if
she
expected
sweets
from
both
hands
it
is
easy
for
you
to
see
through
her
empty
head
do
not
give
her
up
till
she
has
had
time
to
look
a
little
way
into
your
eyes
eveena
i
answered
almost
as
much
pained
as
touched
by
the
unaffected
humility
which
had
so
accepted
and
carried
out
my
ironical
comparison
one
simple
would
unlock
the
breast
whose
secrets
seem
so
puzzling
but
it
has
hardly
a
name
in
your
tongue
and
can
not
yet
be
in
your
hands
ah
yes
she
said
softly
you
gave
it
me
do
you
think
i
have
lost
it
in
two
nights
but
the
esve
can
not
be
loved
as
she
loves
her
master
i
could
half
understand
the
prodigal
heart
that
would
buy
a
girl
life
with
yours
and
all
that
is
bound
up
in
yours
no
other
would
have
done
it
in
our
world
she
added
answering
my
gesture
of
dissent
but
they
say
that
the
terrible
will
stand
by
his
dying
mate
till
he
is
shot
down
you
bought
my
heart
my
love
all
i
am
when
you
bought
my
life
and
never
asked
the
cost
she
continued
almost
in
a
whisper
her
cheeks
and
moist
eyes
hidden
from
my
sight
as
the
lips
murmured
their
loving
words
into
my
ear
though
the
nestling
never
looked
from
under
the
wing
do
you
think
she
knows
not
what
to
expect
when
she
is
bought
from
the
nest
she
dares
not
struggle
in
the
hand
that
snatches
her
much
more
did
she
deserve
to
be
rated
and
rapped
for
fluttering
in
that
which
saved
her
life
bought
twice
over
caged
by
right
as
by
might
was
her
thought
midnight
to
your
eyes
when
she
wondered
at
the
look
that
watched
her
so
quietly
the
hand
that
would
not
try
to
touch
lest
it
should
scare
her
the
patience
that
soothed
and
coaxed
her
to
perch
on
the
outstretched
finger
like
a
tamed
at
last
do
you
think
that
name
given
her
by
lips
which
softened
even
their
words
of
fondness
for
her
ear
did
not
go
to
her
heart
straight
as
the
esve
flies
home
or
that
it
could
ever
be
forgotten
there
is
a
chant
young
girls
are
fond
of
which
tells
more
than
i
can
say
her
tones
fell
so
low
that
i
should
have
lost
them
had
her
lips
not
actually
touched
my
ear
while
she
chanted
the
strange
words
in
the
sweetest
notes
of
her
sweet
voice
never
yet
hath
single
sun
seen
a
tamed
and
won
sun
and
stars
shall
quit
the
sky
ere
a
bird
so
tamed
shall
fly
never
human
lips
have
kissed
tamed
mist
and
mist
bird
so
tamed
from
tamer
heart
night
of
death
shall
hardly

chapter
xii
on
the
river
the
next
morning
saw
our
journey
commenced
eveena
wardrobe
with
my
own
and
my
books
portfolios
models
and
specimens
of
terrestrial
art
and
mechanism
were
packed
in
light
metallic
cases
adapted
to
the
larger
form
of
carriage
whereof
i
have
made
mention
i
was
fortunate
in
escaping
the
actual
parting
scene
between
eveena
and
her
family
and
my
own
was
hurried
esmo
and
his
son
accompanied
us
leading
the
way
in
one
carriage
while
eveena
and
myself
occupied
that
which
we
had
used
on
our
memorable
trip
to
the
astronaut
half
an
hour
brought
us
to
the
road
beside
the
river
and
a
few
minutes
more
to
the
point
at
which
a
boat
awaited
us
the
road
being
some
eight
or
ten
feet
above
the
level
of
the
water
a
light
ladder
not
three
feet
long
was
ready
to
assist
our
descent
to
the
deck
the
difference
of
size
between
the
martial
race
and
my
own
was
forcibly
impressed
upon
me
in
seeing
that
esmo
and
his
son
found
this
assistance
needful
or
at
least
convenient
while
i
simply
stepped
rather
than
jumped
to
the
deck
and
lifted
eveena
straight
from
her
carriage
to
her
seat
under
the
canopy
that
covered
the
stern
of
the
vessel
intended
only
for
river
navigation
propelled
by
a
small
screw
like
two
fishtails
set
at
right
angles
working
horizontally
the
vessel
had
but
two
cabins
one
on
either
side
of
the
central
part
occupied
by
the
machinery
the
stern
apartment
was
appropriated
to
myself
and
my
bride
the
forecastle
if
i
may
so
call
it
to
our
companions
the
boatmen
having
berths
in
the
corners
of
the
the
vessel
was
drawing
about
eighteen
inches
of
water
and
rising
about
five
feet
from
the
surface
leaving
an
interior
height
which
obliged
me
to
be
cautious
in
order
not
to
strike
my
head
against
every
projection
or
support
of
the
cabin
roof
we
spent
the
whole
of
the
day
however
on
deck
and
purposely
slackened
the
speed
of
the
boat
which
usually
travels
some
thirty
miles
an
hour
in
order
to
enjoy
the
effect
and
observe
the
details
of
the
landscape
for
the
first
few
miles
our
voyage
lay
through
the
open
plain
then
we
passed
on
the
left
as
we
ascended
the
stream
the
mountain
on
whose
summit
i
tried
with
my
binocular
to
discern
the
astronaut
but
unsuccessfully
the
trees
on
the
lower
slopes
intercepting
the
view
eveena
seeing
my
eyes
fixed
on
that
point
extended
her
hand
and
gently
drew
the
glass
out
of
mine
not
yet
she
said
which
elicited
from
me
the
excuse
that
mountain
has
for
me
remembrances
more
interesting
than
those
of
my
voyage
or
even
than
the
hopes
of
return
presently
as
we
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
we
lost
sight
altogether
of
the
rapidly
dwindling
patches
of
colour
representing
the
enclosures
of
ecasfe
on
our
left
at
a
distance
varying
from
three
to
five
miles
but
constantly
increasing
as
the
stream
bent
to
the
northward
was
the
mountain
range
i
had
scanned
in
my
descent
on
our
right
the
plain
dipped
below
the
horizon
while
still
but
a
few
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
but
in
the
distant
sky
we
discerned
some
objects
like
white
clouds
which
from
their
immobility
and
fixedness
of
outline
i
soon
discovered
to
be
hills
lower
however
than
those
to
the
northward
and
perhaps
some
forty
miles
distant
the
valley
is
one
of
the
richest
and
most
fertile
portions
of
this
continent
and
was
consequently
thoroughly
cultivated
and
more
densely
peopled
than
most
parts
even
of
the
equatorial
zone
an
immediate
river
frontage
being
as
convenient
as
agreeable
the
enclosures
on
either
bank
were
continuous
and
narrow
in
proportion
to
their
depth
the
largest
occupying
no
more
than
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
yards
of
the
bank
the
smaller
from
half
to
one
quarter
of
that
length
most
had
a
tunnel
pierced
under
the
road
bordering
the
river
through
which
the
water
was
admitted
to
their
grounds
and
carried
in
a
minute
stream
around
and
even
through
the
house
for
ornament
rather
than
for
use
since
every
house
in
a
district
so
populous
has
a
regular
artificial
water
supply
and
irrigation
as
i
have
explained
is
not
required
the
river
itself
was
embellished
with
masses
of
and
the
smallest
scarcely
larger
than
a
wagtail
the
largest
somewhat
exceeding
the
size
of
a
swan
of
a
different
form
and
dark
grey
plumage
but
hardly
less
graceful
seemed
to
be
aware
of
the
stringent
protection
they
enjoyed
from
the
law
they
came
up
to
our
boat
and
fed
out
of
eveena
hand
with
perfect
fearlessness
i
could
not
induce
any
of
them
to
be
equally
familiar
with
myself
my
size
probably
surprising
them
as
much
as
their
masters
and
leading
them
to
the
same
doubt
whether
i
were
really
and
wholly
human
the
lower
slopes
of
the
hills
were
covered
with
orchards
of
every
kind
each
species
occupying
the
level
best
suited
to
it
from
the
of
the
lowlands
to
the
tall
above
which
stretched
the
timber
forests
extending
as
high
as
trees
could
grow
while
between
these
and
the
permanent
lay
the
yellowish
herbage
of
extensive
pastures
a
similar
mountain
range
on
earth
would
have
presented
a
greater
variety
of
colouring
and
scenery
the
total
absence
of
glaciers
even
in
the
highest
valleys
creating
a
notable
difference
the
truth
is
that
the
snows
of
mars
are
nowhere
deep
and
melt
in
the
summer
to
such
an
extent
that
that
constant
increase
whose
downward
tendency
feeds
terrestrial
glaciers
can
not
take
place
probably
the
thin
atmosphere
above
the
can
hold
but
little
watery
vapour
esmo
was
of
opinion
that
the
snow
on
the
highest
steeps
even
on
a
level
plateau
was
never
more
than
two
feet
in
depth
and
in
more
than
one
case
a
peak
or
pinnacle
was
kept
almost
clear
and
presented
in
its
grey
green
or
vermilion
rocks
a
striking
contrast
to
the
masses
of
creamy
white
around
it
this
may
explain
the
very
rapid
diminution
of
the
polar
in
the
summer
of
either
but
especially
of
the
southern
hemisphere
and
also
the
occasional
appearance
of
large
dark
spots
in
their
midst
where
the
shallow
snow
has
probably
been
swept
away
by
the
rare
storms
of
this
planet
from
an
extensive
land
surface
it
is
supposed
that
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
ice
and
snow
immediately
surrounding
the
poles
covers
land
but
though
balloon
parties
have
of
late
occasionally
reached
the
poles
they
have
never
ventured
to
remain
there
long
enough
to
disembark
and
ascertain
the
fact
towards
evening
the
stream
turned
more
decidedly
to
the
north
and
at
this
point
esmo
brought
out
an
instrument
constructed
somewhat
on
the
principle
of
a
sextant
or
quadrant
but
without
the
mirror
by
which
we
were
enabled
to
take
reliable
measures
of
the
angles
by
a
process
which
at
that
time
i
did
not
accurately
follow
and
which
i
had
not
subsequently
the
means
of
verifying
the
distance
as
well
as
the
angle
subtended
by
the
height
was
obtained
kevimâ
after
working
out
his
father
figures
informed
me
that
the
highest
peak
in
view
the
highest
in
mars
was
not
less
than
feet
no
martial
balloonist
much
less
any
martial
has
ever
save
once
reached
a
greater
height
than
feet
the
air
at
the
being
scarcely
more
dense
than
ours
at
feet
kevimâ
indicated
one
spot
in
the
southern
range
of
remarkable
interest
associated
with
an
incident
which
forms
an
epoch
in
the
records
of
martial
geography
a
sloping
plateau
some
feet
above
the
is
defined
with
remarkable
clearness
in
the
direction
from
which
we
viewed
it
the
forests
appeared
to
hide
though
they
do
not
of
course
actually
approach
its
lower
edge
on
one
side
and
to
the
rear
it
is
shut
in
by
precipices
so
abrupt
that
the
snow
fails
to
cling
to
them
while
on
the
remaining
side
it
is
separated
by
a
deep
wide
cleft
from
the
western
portion
of
the
range
here
for
centuries
were
visible
the
relics
of
an
exploring
party
which
reached
this
plateau
and
never
returned
attempts
have
since
the
steering
of
balloons
has
become
an
accomplished
fact
been
made
to
reach
the
point
but
without
success
and
those
who
have
approached
nearest
have
failed
to
find
any
of
the
remains
of
an
expedition
which
perished
four
or
five
thousand
years
ago
kevimâ
thought
it
probable
that
the
metallic
poles
even
then
employed
for
tents
and
for
climbing
purposes
might
still
be
intact
but
if
so
they
were
certainly
buried
in
the
snow
and
esmo
believed
it
more
likely
that
even
these
had
perished
as
the
mists
of
evening
fell
we
retreated
to
our
cabin
which
was
warmed
by
a
current
of
heated
air
from
the
electric
machinery
here
our
evening
meal
was
served
at
which
esmo
and
his
son
joined
us
eveena
resuming
even
in
their
presence
the
veil
she
had
worn
on
deck
but
had
laid
aside
the
moment
we
were
alone
an
hour
or
two
after
sunset
the
night
an
unusual
occurrence
in
mars
was
clear
and
fine
and
i
took
this
opportunity
of
observing
from
a
new
standpoint
the
familiar
constellations
the
scintillation
so
characteristic
of
the
fixed
stars
especially
in
the
temperate
climates
of
the
earth
was
scarcely
perceptible
scattered
once
more
over
the
surface
of
a
defined
sky
it
was
much
easier
than
in
space
to
recognise
the
several
constellations
but
their
new
and
strange
situations
were
not
a
little
surprising
at
first
sight
some
of
those
which
as
seen
on
earth
revolved
slowly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
poles
being
now
not
far
from
the
tropics
and
some
which
had
their
place
within
the
tropics
now
lying
far
to
north
or
south
around
the
northern
pole
the
swan
swings
by
its
tail
as
in
our
skies
the
lesser
bear
arided
being
a
which
needs
no
pointers
to
indicate
its
position
vega
is
the
only
other
brilliant
star
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
and
save
for
the
presence
of
the
milky
way
directly
crossing
it
the
arctic
circle
is
distinctly
less
bright
than
our
own
the
south
pole
lies
in
one
of
the
dullest
regions
of
the
heavens
near
the
chief
star
of
the
peacock
arcturus
the
great
bear
the
twins
the
lion
the
scorpion
and
fomalhaut
are
among
the
ornaments
of
the
equatorial
zone
the
cross
the
centaur
and
the
ship
of
our
antarctic
constellations
are
visible
far
into
the
northern
hemisphere
on
the
present
occasion
the
two
moons
were
both
visible
in
the
west
the
horns
of
both
crescents
pointing
in
the
same
direction
though
the
one
was
in
her
last
the
other
in
her
first
phase
as
we
were
watching
them
eveena
wrapped
in
a
cloak
of
fur
not
a
little
resembling
that
of
the
silver
fox
but
far
softer
stole
her
hand
into
mine
and
whispered
a
request
that
i
would
lend
her
the
instrument
i
was
using
with
some
instruction
and
help
she
contrived
to
adjust
it
her
sight
requiring
a
decided
alteration
of
the
focus
and
an
approach
of
the
two
the
eyes
of
her
race
being
set
somewhat
nearer
than
in
an
average
aryan
countenance
she
expressed
no
little
surprise
at
the
clearness
of
definition
and
the
marked
enlargement
of
the
discs
of
the
two
satellites
and
would
have
used
the
instrument
to
scan
the
stars
and
visible
planets
had
i
not
insisted
on
her
retirement
the
light
atmosphere
as
is
always
the
case
on
clear
nights
when
no
prevents
rapid
radiation
from
the
surface
being
bitterly
cold
and
her
life
not
having
accustomed
her
to
the
night
air
even
in
the
most
genial
season
as
we
could
of
course
see
nothing
of
the
country
through
which
we
passed
during
the
night
and
as
esmo
informed
me
that
little
or
nothing
of
special
interest
would
occur
during
this
part
of
our
voyage
our
vessel
went
at
full
speed
her
pilot
being
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
river
and
an
electric
light
in
the
bow
enabling
him
to
steer
with
perfect
confidence
and
safety
when
therefore
we
came
on
deck
after
the
dissipation
of
the
morning
mist
we
found
ourselves
in
a
scene
very
different
from
that
which
we
had
left
our
course
was
north
by
west
on
either
bank
lay
a
country
cultivated
indeed
but
chiefly
pastoral
producing
a
rich
herbage
grazed
by
innumerable
herds
among
which
i
observed
with
interest
several
flocks
of
large
birds
kept
as
esmo
informed
me
partly
for
their
plumage
this
presented
remarkable
combinations
of
colour
far
surpassing
in
brilliancy
and
in
variety
of
pattern
the
tail
of
the
peacock
and
often
rivalling
in
length
and
delicacy
while
exceeding
in
beauty
of
colouring
the
splendid
feathers
which
must
have
embarrassed
the
bird
of
paradise
even
before
they
rendered
him
an
object
of
pursuit
by
those
who
have
learnt
the
vices
and
are
eager
to
purchase
the
wares
of
civilised
man
immediately
across
our
course
at
a
distance
of
some
thirty
miles
stretched
a
range
of
mountains
i
inquired
of
esmo
how
the
river
turned
in
order
to
avoid
them
since
no
opening
was
visible
even
through
my
glass
the
proper
course
of
the
river
he
said
lies
at
the
foot
of
those
hills
but
this
would
take
us
out
of
our
road
and
moreover
the
stream
is
not
navigable
for
many
stoloi
above
the
we
shall
hold
on
nearly
in
the
same
direction
as
the
present
till
we
land
at
their
foot
and
how
i
said
are
we
to
cross
them
at
your
choice
either
by
carriage
or
by
balloon
he
said
there
is
at
our
a
town
in
which
we
shall
easily
procure
either
but
said
i
though
our
luggage
is
far
less
heavy
than
would
be
that
of
a
bride
on
earth
and
eveena
forms
the
smallest
portion
of
it
i
should
fancy
that
it
must
be
inconveniently
heavy
for
a
balloon
certainly
he
replied
but
we
could
send
it
by
carriage
even
over
the
mountain
roads
the
boat
however
will
go
on
and
will
meet
us
some
thirty
miles
beyond
the
point
where
we
leave
it
and
how
is
the
boat
to
pass
over
the
hills
not
over
but
under
he
said
smiling
there
is
no
natural
passage
entirely
through
the
range
but
there
is
within
it
a
valley
the
bottom
of
which
is
not
much
higher
than
this
plain
of
the
thirty
miles
to
be
traversed
about
lies
in
the
course
of
this
valley
along
which
an
artificial
canal
has
been
made
through
the
hills
at
either
end
a
tunnel
has
been
cut
the
one
of
six
the
other
of
about
nine
miles
in
length
affording
a
perfectly
safe
and
easy
course
for
the
boat
and
it
is
through
these
that
nearly
all
the
heavy
traffic
passing
in
this
direction
is
conveyed
i
should
like
i
said
if
it
be
possible
to
pass
through
one
at
least
of
these
tunnels
unless
there
be
on
the
mountains
themselves
something
especially
worth
seeing
nothing
he
replied
they
are
low
none
much
exceeding
the
height
of
that
from
which
you
descended
eveena
now
joined
us
on
deck
and
we
amused
ourselves
for
the
next
two
hours
in
observing
the
different
animals
of
which
such
numbers
were
to
be
seen
at
every
turn
domesticated
and
trained
for
one
or
other
of
the
many
methods
in
which
the
brutes
can
serve
the
convenience
the
sustenance
or
the
luxury
of
man
animal
food
is
eaten
on
mars
but
the
flesh
of
birds
and
fish
is
much
more
largely
employed
than
that
of
quadrupeds
and
eggs
and
milk
enter
into
the
cuisine
far
more
extensively
than
either
in
fact
flesh
and
fish
are
used
much
as
they
seem
to
have
been
in
the
earlier
period
of
greek
civilisation
as
relish
and
supplement
to
fruits
vegetables
and
farinaceous
dishes
rather
than
as
the
principal
element
of
food
as
their
training
and
their
extreme
tameness
indicate
domestic
creatures
even
those
destined
only
to
serve
as
food
or
to
furnish
clothing
are
treated
not
indeed
with
tenderness
but
with
gentleness
and
without
either
the
neglect
or
the
cruelty
which
so
revolt
humane
men
in
witnessing
the
treatment
of
terrestrial
animals
by
those
who
have
personal
charge
of
them
to
describe
any
considerable
number
of
the
hundred
forms
i
saw
during
this
short
period
would
be
impossible
i
have
drawings
or
rather
pictures
of
most
taken
by
the
process
which
i
hope
herewith
to
remit
to
earth
and
which
at
least
serve
to
give
a
general
idea
of
the
points
in
which
the
martial
chiefly
differs
from
the
terrestrial
fauna
those
animals
whose
coats
furnish
a
textile
fibre
more
resemble
reindeer
and
goats
than
sheep
their
wool
is
softer
longer
and
less
curly
free
also
from
the
greasiness
of
the
sheep
it
seemed
to
me
that
an
extreme
quaintness
characterised
the
domestic
creatures
kept
for
special
purposes
this
was
not
the
effect
of
mere
novelty
for
animals
like
the
and
birds
like
the
trained
to
the
performance
of
services
congenial
to
their
natural
habits
however
dissimilar
to
terrestrial
species
had
not
the
same
air
of
singularity
or
rather
of
monstrosity
but
in
the
creatures
bred
to
furnish
wool
feathers
or
the
like
some
single
feature
was
always
exaggerated
into
disproportionate
dimensions
thus
the
is
loaded
with
long
plumes
sometimes
twice
the
length
of
the
body
and
curled
upward
at
the
extremity
so
that
it
can
neither
fly
nor
run
and
though
its
plumage
is
exquisitely
beautiful
the
creature
itself
is
simply
ludicrous
it
bears
the
same
popular
repute
for
sagacity
as
the
goose
of
european
farmyards
the
has
hair
or
wool
so
long
that
its
limbs
are
almost
hidden
just
before
in
the
tresses
that
hang
from
the
body
half
way
to
the
ground
the
a
bird
no
larger
than
a
norfolk
turkey
has
the
hinder
part
developed
to
an
enormous
size
so
that
the
graceful
neck
and
shoulders
appear
as
if
lost
in
the
huge
proportions
of
the
body
and
the
little
wings
are
totally
unfit
to
raise
it
in
the
air
while
it
lays
almost
daily
eggs
as
large
as
those
of
the
ostrich
and
of
peculiar
richness
and
flavour
nearly
all
the
domestic
birds
kept
for
the
sake
of
eggs
or
feathers
have
wings
that
look
as
if
they
had
been
clipped
and
are
incapable
of
flight
creatures
valued
for
their
flesh
such
as
the
somewhat
like
the
eland
but
with
the
single
horn
so
common
among
its
congeners
in
mars
and
with
a
soft
white
hide
and
the
a
bird
about
the
size
of
the
peacock
with
the
form
of
the
partridge
and
the
flavour
of
grouse
or
black
game
preserve
more
natural
proportions
the
of
the
latter
however
having
been
systematically
plucked
for
hundreds
of
generations
are
now
dwarfed
and
useless
these
animals
are
not
encouraged
to
make
fat
on
the
one
hand
or
to
develop
powerful
muscles
and
sinews
on
the
other
they
are
fed
for
part
of
the
year
on
the
higher
and
thinner
pastures
of
the
mountains
when
brought
down
to
the
meadows
of
the
plain
they
are
allowed
to
graze
only
for
a
few
hours
before
sunset
and
after
sunrise
they
thus
preserve
much
of
the
flavour
of
game
or
mountain
sheep
and
cattle
which
the
oxen
and
poultry
of
europe
have
lost
flavour
not
quantity
being
the
chief
object
of
care
with
martial
graziers
sometimes
however
some
peculiarity
perfectly
useless
or
even
inconvenient
appears
to
be
naturally
associated
with
that
which
is
artificially
developed
thus
the
beak
of
the
is
weak
and
often
splits
so
as
to
render
its
rearing
troublesome
and
entail
considerable
losses
while
the
horns
of
the
animals
are
long
and
strong
enough
to
be
formidable
but
so
rough
and
coarsely
grained
that
they
are
turned
to
no
account
for
use
or
ornament
we
were
rapidly
approaching
the
foot
of
the
hills
where
the
river
made
another
and
abrupt
turn
at
this
point
the
produce
of
the
whole
upper
valley
is
generally
embarked
and
supplies
from
all
other
quarters
are
here
received
and
distributed
in
consequence
a
town
large
and
important
for
this
planet
where
no
one
who
can
help
it
prefers
the
crowded
street
to
the
freedom
and
expanse
of
the
country
had
grown
up
with
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
houses
and
perhaps
a
thousand
inhabitants
it
was
so
much
matter
of
course
that
voyagers
should
disembark
to
cross
the
hills
or
to
pursue
their
journey
along
the
upper
part
of
the
river
by
road
that
different
partnerships
made
it
their
business
to
assist
in
the
transfer
of
passengers
and
light
wares
ahead
of
us
was
a
somewhat
steep
in
the
lower
part
of
which
a
wall
absolutely
perpendicular
had
been
cut
by
those
who
pierced
the
tunnel
the
mouth
of
which
was
now
clearly
visible
immediately
before
us
it
was
about
twelve
feet
in
height
and
perhaps
twenty
feet
in
width
the
stream
which
like
nearly
all
martial
rivers
is
wide
and
shallow
had
during
the
last
fifty
miles
of
our
course
grown
narrower
with
a
depth
at
the
same
time
constantly
lessening
so
that
some
care
was
required
on
the
part
of
the
pilot
to
avoid
running
aground
a
stream
of
twenty
inches
in
depth
affording
room
for
two
boats
to
pass
abreast
is
considered
navigable
for
vessels
only
carrying
passengers
thirty
inches
are
required
to
afford
a
course
which
for
heavy
freight
is
preferable
to
the
road
eveena
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
we
should
disembark
here
and
it
was
not
till
we
had
come
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
where
the
bank
was
perpendicular
and
levelled
to
a
height
above
the
water
which
enabled
passengers
to
step
directly
from
the
deck
of
the
boat
without
slackening
our
speed
that
the
possibility
of
our
intending
to
accompany
the
boat
on
its
subterrene
course
occurred
to
her
as
she
did
not
speak
but
merely
drew
closer
to
me
and
held
fast
my
hand
i
had
no
idea
of
her
real
distress
till
we
were
actually
at
the
mouth
of
the
black
and
very
passage
and
the
pilot
had
lighted
the
electric
lamp
as
the
boat
shot
under
the
arch
she
could
not
repress
a
cry
of
terror
naturally
putting
my
arm
round
her
at
this
sign
of
alarm
i
felt
that
she
was
trembling
violently
and
a
single
look
despite
her
veil
convinced
me
that
she
was
crying
though
in
silence
and
doing
her
utmost
to
conceal
her
tears
are
you
so
frightened
child
i
asked
i
have
been
through
many
subterranean
passages
though
none
so
long
and
dark
as
this
but
you
see
our
lamp
lights
up
not
only
the
boat
but
the
whole
vault
around
and
before
us
and
there
can
be
no
danger
whatever
i
am
frightened
though
she
said
i
can
not
help
it
i
never
saw
anything
of
the
kind
before
and
the
darkness
behind
and
before
us
and
the
black
water
on
either
side
do
make
me
shiver
stop
i
called
to
the
boatman
now
eveena
i
said
i
do
not
care
to
persist
in
this
journey
if
it
really
distresses
you
i
wished
to
see
so
wonderful
a
work
of
engineering
but
after
all
i
have
been
in
a
much
uglier
and
more
wonderful
place
and
i
can
see
nothing
here
stranger
than
when
i
was
rowed
for
of
a
mile
on
the
river
in
the
mammoth
cave
in
any
case
i
shall
see
little
but
a
continuation
of
what
i
see
already
so
if
you
can
not
bear
it
we
will
go
back
by
this
time
esmo
who
had
been
in
the
bows
had
joined
us
wishing
to
know
why
i
had
stopped
the
boat
this
child
i
said
is
not
used
to
travelling
and
the
tunnel
frightens
her
so
that
i
think
after
all
we
had
better
take
the
usual
course
across
the
mountains
nonsense
he
answered
there
is
no
danger
here
less
probably
than
in
an
ordinary
drive
certainly
less
than
in
a
balloon
do
spoil
her
my
friend
if
you
begin
by
yielding
to
so
silly
a
caprice
as
this
you
will
end
by
breaking
her
heart
before
the
two
years
are
out
do
go
on
whispered
eveena
i
was
very
silly
i
am
not
so
frightened
now
and
if
you
will
hold
me
fast
i
will
not
misbehave
again
esmo
had
taken
the
matter
out
of
my
hands
desiring
the
boatman
to
proceed
and
though
i
sympathised
with
my
bride
feminine
terror
much
more
than
her
father
appeared
to
do
i
was
selfishly
anxious
in
spite
of
my
declaration
that
there
could
be
no
novelty
in
this
tunnel
to
see
one
thing
certainly
original
the
means
by
which
so
narrow
and
so
long
a
passage
could
be
efficiently
ventilated
the
least
i
could
do
however
was
to
appease
eveena
fear
before
turning
my
attention
to
the
objects
of
my
own
curiosity
the
presence
of
physical
strength
which
seemed
to
her
superhuman
produced
upon
her
nerves
the
quieting
effect
which
however
irrationally
great
bodily
force
always
exercises
over
women
partly
perhaps
from
the
awe
it
seems
to
inspire
partly
from
a
yet
more
unreasonable
but
instinctive
reliance
on
its
protection
even
in
dangers
against
which
it
is
obviously
unavailing
presently
a
current
of
air
distinctly
warmer
than
that
of
the
tunnel
which
had
been
gradually
increasing
in
force
for
some
minutes
became
so
powerful
that
i
could
no
longer
suppose
it
accidental
kevimâ
being
near
us
i
asked
him
what
it
meant
ventilation
he
answered
the
air
in
these
tunnels
would
be
foul
and
stagnant
perhaps
unbreathable
if
we
did
not
drive
a
constant
current
of
air
through
them
you
did
not
notice
a
few
yards
from
the
entrance
a
wheel
which
drives
a
large
fan
one
of
these
is
placed
at
every
half
mile
and
drives
on
the
air
from
one
end
of
the
tunnel
to
the
other
they
are
reversed
twice
in
a
zyda
so
that
they
may
create
no
constant
outside
but
is
not
the
power
exerted
to
drive
so
great
a
body
of
air
exceedingly
costly
no
he
answered
as
you
are
aware
electricity
is
almost
our
only
motive
power
and
we
calculate
that
the
labour
of
two
men
even
without
the
help
of
machines
could
in
their
working
zydau
eight
hours
collect
and
reduce
a
sufficient
amount
of
the
elements
by
which
the
current
is
created
to
do
the
work
of
four
hundred
men
during
a
whole
day
and
night
and
how
long
i
inquired
has
electricity
had
so
complete
a
monopoly
of
mechanical
work
it
was
first
brought
into
general
use
he
replied
about
eight
thousand
years
ago
before
that
heated
air
supplied
our
principal
locomotive
force
as
well
as
the
power
of
stationary
machines
wherever
no
waterfall
of
sufficient
energy
was
at
hand
for
several
centuries
the
old
powers
were
still
employed
under
conditions
favourable
to
their
use
but
we
have
found
electricity
so
much
cheaper
than
the
cheapest
of
other
artificial
forces
so
much
more
powerful
than
any
supplied
by
nature
that
we
have
long
discontinued
the
employment
of
any
other
even
when
we
obtain
electricity
by
means
of
heat
we
find
that
the
gain
in
application
more
than
compensates
the
loss
in
the
transmutation
of
one
force
into
another
in
the
course
of
little
more
than
half
an
hour
we
emerged
from
the
tunnel
whose
gloom
when
once
the
attraction
of
novelty
was
gone
was
certainly
unpleasant
to
myself
if
not
by
any
means
so
frightful
as
eveena
still
found
it
there
was
nothing
specially
attractive
or
noticeable
in
the
valley
through
which
our
course
now
ran
except
the
extreme
height
of
its
mountain
walls
which
though
not
by
any
means
perpendicular
rose
to
a
height
of
some
feet
so
suddenly
that
to
climb
their
sides
would
have
been
absolutely
impossible
only
during
about
two
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
day
is
the
sun
seen
from
the
level
of
the
stream
and
it
is
dark
in
the
bottom
of
this
valley
long
before
the
mist
has
fallen
on
the
plain
outside
we
had
presently
however
to
ascend
a
slope
of
some
feet
in
the
mile
and
i
was
much
interested
in
the
peculiar
method
by
which
the
ascent
was
made
a
mere
ascent
not
greater
than
that
of
some
rapids
up
which
american
boatmen
have
managed
to
carry
their
barques
by
manual
force
presented
no
great
difficulty
but
some
skill
is
required
at
particular
points
to
avoid
being
overturned
by
the
rush
of
the
water
and
our
vessel
so
careened
as
to
afford
much
more
excuse
for
outbreak
of
terror
than
the
tunnel
had
done
had
i
not
held
her
fast
she
must
certainly
have
been
thrown
overboard
the
pilot
used
to
the
danger
having
forgotten
to
warn
us
for
the
rest
in
the
absence
of
rocks
the
vessel
ascended
more
easily
than
a
powerful
steamer
if
she
could
find
sufficient
depth
could
make
her
way
up
the
rapids
of
the
lawrence
or
similar
streams
we
entered
the
second
tunnel
without
any
sign
of
alarm
from
eveena
perceptible
to
others
only
her
clinging
to
my
hand
expressed
the
fear
of
which
she
was
ashamed
but
could
not
rid
herself
emerging
from
its
mouth
we
found
ourselves
within
sight
of
the
sea
and
of
the
town
and
harbour
of
serocasfe
where
we
were
next
day
to
embark
landing
from
the
boat
we
were
met
by
the
friend
whose
hospitality
esmo
had
requested
at
his
house
half
a
mile
outside
the
town
for
the
first
time
since
our
marriage
i
had
to
part
for
a
short
period
with
eveena
who
was
led
away
by
the
veiled
mistress
of
the
house
while
we
remained
in
the
entrance
chamber
or
hall
the
evening
meal
was
anticipated
by
two
hours
in
order
that
we
might
attend
the
meeting
at
which
my
bride
and
i
were
to
receive
our
formal
admission
into
the
zinta
chapter
xiii
the
children
of
light
probably
said
esmo
when
apparently
at
a
sign
from
him
our
host
left
us
for
some
minutes
alone
much
through
which
you
are
about
to
pass
will
seem
to
you
childish
or
unmeaning
ceremonial
rendered
impressive
to
us
by
immemorial
antiquity
and
cherished
the
more
because
so
contrary
to
the
absence
of
form
and
ceremony
in
the
life
around
us
symbolism
which
is
really
the
more
useful
the
more
valuable
because
it
contains
much
deeper
meaning
than
is
ever
apparent
at
first
sight
have
proved
their
use
by
experience
and
as
they
are
generally
witnessed
for
the
first
time
in
early
youth
make
a
sharper
impression
than
they
are
likely
to
effect
upon
a
mind
like
yours
but
they
may
seem
strangely
inconsistent
with
a
belief
which
is
in
itself
so
limited
and
founded
so
absolutely
upon
logical
proof
or
practical
evidence
the
best
testimony
to
the
soundness
of
our
policy
in
this
respect
is
the
fact
that
our
vows
and
the
rites
by
which
they
are
sanctioned
are
never
broken
that
our
symbols
are
regarded
with
an
awe
which
no
threats
no
penalties
can
attach
to
the
highest
of
civil
authorities
or
the
most
solemn
legal
sanctions
the
language
of
symbol
moreover
has
for
us
two
great
advantages
one
dependent
upon
the
depth
of
thought
and
knowledge
with
which
the
symbols
themselves
were
selected
by
our
founder
owing
to
which
each
generation
finds
in
them
some
new
truth
of
which
we
never
dreamed
before
the
other
arising
from
the
fact
that
we
are
a
small
select
body
in
the
midst
of
a
hostile
and
jealous
race
from
whom
it
is
most
important
to
keep
the
key
of
communications
which
without
the
appearance
have
all
the
effect
of
ciphers
i
find
i
replied
in
my
own
world
that
every
religion
and
every
form
of
occult
mysticism
nay
every
science
in
its
own
way
and
within
its
own
range
attaches
great
importance
to
symbols
in
themselves
apparently
arbitrary
experience
shows
that
these
symbols
often
contain
a
clue
to
more
than
they
were
originally
meant
to
convey
and
can
be
employed
in
reasonings
far
beyond
the
grasp
of
those
who
first
invented
or
adopted
them
that
a
body
like
the
could
be
held
together
without
ceremonial
and
without
formalities
which
if
they
had
no
other
value
would
have
the
attraction
of
secresy
and
exclusiveness
seems
obviously
impossible
here
our
host
rejoined
us
we
passed
into
the
gallery
where
several
persons
were
awaiting
us
the
men
for
the
most
part
wearing
a
small
vizor
dependent
from
the
turban
which
concealed
their
faces
the
women
all
without
exception
closely
veiled
as
soon
as
esmo
appeared
the
party
formed
themselves
into
a
sort
of
procession
two
and
two
motioning
me
to
take
the
last
place
esmo
passed
himself
to
its
head
if
the
figure
beside
me
were
not
at
once
recognised
i
could
not
mistake
the
touch
of
the
hand
that
stole
into
my
own
the
lights
in
the
gallery
were
extinguished
and
then
i
perceived
a
lamp
held
at
the
end
of
a
wand
of
crystal
which
gleamed
above
esmo
head
and
sufficed
to
guide
us
giving
light
enough
to
direct
our
footsteps
and
little
more
perhaps
this
the
twilight
which
gave
a
certain
air
of
mystery
to
the
scene
and
of
uncertainty
to
the
forms
of
objects
encountered
on
our
route
had
its
own
purpose
we
reached
very
soon
the
end
of
the
gallery
and
then
the
procession
turned
and
passed
suddenly
into
another
chamber
apparently
narrow
but
so
faintly
lighted
by
the
lamp
in
our
leader
hands
that
its
dimensions
were
matter
of
mere
conjecture
that
we
were
descending
a
somewhat
steep
incline
i
was
soon
aware
and
when
we
came
again
on
to
level
ground
i
felt
sure
that
we
were
passing
through
a
gallery
cut
in
natural
rock
the
light
was
far
too
dim
to
enable
me
to
distinguish
any
openings
in
the
walls
but
the
procession
constantly
lengthened
though
it
was
impossible
to
see
where
and
when
new
members
joined
suddenly
the
light
disappeared
i
stood
still
for
a
moment
in
surprise
and
when
i
again
went
forward
i
became
speedily
conscious
that
all
our
companions
had
vanished
and
that
we
stood
alone
in
utter
darkness
fearing
to
lead
eveena
further
where
my
own
steps
were
absolutely
uncertain
i
paused
for
some
time
and
with
little
difficulty
decided
to
remain
where
i
was
until
something
should
afford
an
indication
of
the
purpose
of
those
who
had
brought
us
so
far
and
who
must
know
if
they
had
not
actual
means
of
observing
that
in
darkness
and
solitude
i
should
not
venture
to
proceed
presently
as
gradually
as
in
northern
climates
the
night
passes
into
morning
twilight
the
darkness
became
less
absolute
whence
the
light
came
it
was
impossible
to
perceive
diffused
all
around
and
slowly
broadening
it
just
enabled
me
to
discern
a
few
paces
before
us
the
verge
of
a
gulf
this
might
have
been
too
shallow
for
inconvenience
it
might
have
been
deep
enough
for
danger
i
waited
till
my
eyes
should
be
able
to
penetrate
its
interior
but
before
the
light
entered
it
i
perceived
apparently
growing
across
it
really
coming
gradually
into
view
under
the
brightening
gleam
a
species
of
bridge
which
when
the
twilight
ceased
to
increase
and
remained
as
dim
as
that
cast
by
the
crescent
moon
assumed
the
outline
of
a
slender
trunk
supported
by
wings
dark
for
the
most
part
but
defined
along
the
edge
by
a
narrow
band
of
brightest
green
visible
in
a
gleam
too
faint
to
show
any
object
of
a
deeper
shade
somewhat
impatient
of
the
obvious
symbolism
i
hurried
eveena
forward
immediately
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
the
path
turned
almost
at
right
angles
and
here
a
gleam
of
light
ahead
afforded
a
distinct
guidance
to
our
steps
approaching
it
we
were
challenged
and
i
gave
the
answer
with
which
i
had
been
previously
furnished
an
answer
which
may
not
be
as
it
never
has
been
written
down
a
door
parted
and
admitted
us
into
a
small
vestibule
at
the
other
end
of
which
a
full
and
bright
light
streamed
through
a
portal
of
translucent
crystal
a
sentinel
armed
only
with
the
antiquated
spear
which
may
have
been
held
by
his
first
predecessor
in
office
ten
thousand
martial
years
ago
now
demanded
our
names
mine
he
simply
repeated
but
as
i
gave
that
of
eveena
daughter
of
esmo
he
lowered
his
weapon
in
the
salute
still
traditional
among
martial
sentries
and
bending
his
head
touched
with
his
lips
the
long
sleeve
of
the
cloak
of
in
which
she
was
on
this
occasion
again
enveloped
this
homage
appeared
to
surprise
her
almost
as
much
as
myself
but
we
had
no
leisure
for
observation
or
inquiry
from
behind
the
crystal
door
another
challenge
was
uttered
to
this
it
was
the
sentry
part
to
reply
and
as
he
answered
the
door
parted
that
at
the
other
end
of
the
vestibule
having
i
observed
closed
as
we
entered
and
so
closed
that
its
position
was
undiscoverable
before
us
opened
a
hall
of
considerable
size
consisting
of
three
distinct
vaults
defined
by
two
rows
of
pillars
slender
shafts
resembling
tall
branchless
trees
the
capital
of
each
being
formed
by
a
branching
head
like
that
of
the
palm
the
trunks
were
covered
with
golden
scales
the
foliage
at
the
summit
was
of
a
bright
sparkling
emerald
it
was
evident
to
my
observation
that
the
entire
hall
had
been
excavated
from
solid
rock
and
the
pillars
left
in
their
places
each
of
the
side
aisles
if
i
may
so
call
them
was
occupied
by
four
rows
of
seats
similarly
carved
in
the
natural
stone
but
lined
after
martial
fashion
with
cushions
embroidered
in
feathers
and
metals
and
covered
by
woven
fabrics
finer
than
any
known
to
the
looms
of
lyons
or
cashmere
about
of
the
seats
were
occupied
those
to
the
right
as
we
entered
that
is
on
the
left
of
the
dais
at
the
end
of
the
hall
by
men
those
opposite
by
women
all
i
observed
rose
for
a
moment
as
eveena
name
was
announced
from
the
further
end
of
the
hall
by
the
foremost
of
three
or
four
persons
vested
in
silver
with
belts
of
the
crimson
metal
which
plays
the
part
of
our
steel
and
bearing
in
their
hands
wands
of
a
jewel
resembling
a
clouded
onyx
in
all
but
the
hue
each
of
them
wore
over
his
dress
a
band
or
sash
of
gold
fastened
on
the
left
shoulder
and
descending
to
the
belt
on
the
right
much
resembling
the
ribbons
of
european
knighthood
these
supported
on
the
left
breast
a
silver
star
or
heraldic
mullet
of
six
points
throughout
the
rest
of
the
assembly
a
similar
but
smaller
star
glimmered
on
every
breast
supported
however
by
green
or
silver
bands
the
former
worn
by
the
body
of
the
assembly
the
latter
by
a
few
persons
gathered
together
for
the
most
part
at
the
upper
end
of
the
chamber
the
chief
who
had
first
addressed
us
bade
us
pass
on
and
we
left
the
hall
of
the
novitiate
as
accepted
members
of
the
order
that
into
which
we
next
entered
was
so
dark
that
its
form
and
dimensions
were
scarcely
defined
to
my
eyes
i
supposed
it
however
to
be
circular
surmounted
by
a
dome
resembling
in
colour
the
olive
green
martial
sky
and
spangled
by
stars
among
which
i
discerned
one
or
two
familiar
constellations
but
most
distinctly
brightened
far
beyond
its
natural
brilliancy
the
arch
of
the
presently
not
on
any
apparent
sheet
or
screen
but
as
in
the
air
before
us
appeared
a
narrow
band
of
light
crossing
the
entire
visible
space
it
resembled
a
rope
twisted
of
three
strands
two
of
a
deep
dull
hue
the
one
apparently
orange
the
other
brown
or
crimson
contrasting
the
far
more
brilliant
emerald
strand
that
formed
the
third
portion
of
the
threefold
cord
i
had
learnt
by
this
time
that
metallic
cords
so
twined
serve
in
mars
most
of
the
uses
for
which
chains
are
employed
on
earth
and
i
assumed
that
this
symbol
possessed
the
significance
which
poetry
or
ritual
might
attach
to
the
latter
this
cord
or
band
retained
its
position
throughout
crossing
the
dark
background
of
the
scenes
now
successively
presented
each
of
which
melted
into
its
successor
rapidly
but
so
gradually
that
there
was
never
a
distinct
point
of
division
a
moment
at
which
it
was
possible
to
say
that
any
new
feature
was
first
introduced
a
bright
mist
of
various
colours
intermixed
in
inextricable
confusion
an
image
of
chaos
but
for
the
dim
light
reflected
from
all
the
particles
filled
a
great
part
of
the
space
before
us
but
the
cord
was
still
discernible
in
the
background
presently
a
bright
point
of
light
taking
gradually
the
form
of
an
eye
appeared
above
the
cord
and
beyond
the
mist
and
emanating
from
it
a
ray
of
similar
light
entered
the
motionless
vapour
then
a
movement
whose
character
it
was
not
easy
to
discern
but
which
constantly
became
more
and
more
evidently
rhythmical
and
regular
commenced
in
the
mist
within
a
few
moments
the
latter
had
dissolved
leaving
in
its
place
the
semblance
of
stars
and
golden
nebulae
as
dim
and
confused
as
that
in
the
of
orion
or
as
well
defined
as
any
of
those
called
by
astronomers
planetary
what
seest
thou
said
a
voice
whose
very
direction
i
could
not
recognise
cosmos
evolved
out
of
confusion
by
law
law
emanating
from
supreme
wisdom
and
irresistible
will
and
in
the
triple
band
the
continuity
of
time
and
space
preserved
by
the
continuity
of
law
and
controlled
by
the
will
that
gave
law
while
i
spoke
a
single
nebula
grew
larger
brighter
and
filled
the
entire
space
given
throughout
to
the
pictures
presented
to
us
stars
and
gradually
fading
away
into
remoter
distance
this
nebula
of
spherical
shape
formed
of
coarser
particles
than
the
previous
mist
and
reflecting
or
radiating
a
more
brilliant
effulgence
was
in
rapid
whirling
motion
it
flattened
into
the
form
of
a
disc
apparently
almost
circular
of
considerable
depth
or
thickness
visibly
denser
in
the
centre
and
thinner
towards
the
rounded
edge
presently
it
condensed
and
contracted
leaving
at
each
of
the
several
intervals
a
severed
ring
most
of
these
rings
broke
up
their
fragments
conglomerated
and
forming
a
sphere
one
in
particular
separating
into
a
multitude
of
minuter
spheres
others
assuming
a
highly
elliptical
form
condensing
here
and
thinning
out
there
while
the
central
mass
grew
brighter
and
denser
as
it
contracted
till
there
lay
before
me
a
perfect
miniature
of
the
solar
system
with
planets
satellites
asteroids
and
meteoric
rings
what
seest
thou
again
i
heard
intelligence
directing
will
and
will
by
law
developing
the
microcosm
of
which
this
world
is
one
of
the
smallest
parts
the
orb
which
represented
mars
stood
still
in
the
centre
of
the
space
and
this
orb
soon
occupied
the
whole
area
it
assumed
at
first
the
form
of
a
vast
vaporous
globe
then
contracted
to
a
comparatively
small
sphere
glowing
as
if
more
than
and
leaving
as
it
contracted
two
tiny
balls
revolving
round
their
primary
the
latter
gradually
faded
till
it
gave
out
no
light
but
that
which
from
some
unseen
source
was
cast
upon
it
consequently
contrasting
in
darkness
the
reflected
brightness
of
the
other
ere
long
it
presented
the
appearance
of
sea
and
land
of
cloud
of
snow
and
ice
and
became
a
perfect
image
of
the
martial
sphere
then
it
gave
place
to
a
globe
of
water
alone
within
which
the
processes
of
crystallisation
as
exhibited
first
in
its
simpler
then
in
its
more
complicated
forms
were
beautifully
represented
then
there
appeared
i
knew
not
how
but
seemingly
developed
by
the
same
agency
and
in
the
same
manner
as
the
crystals
a
small
transparent
sphere
within
the
watery
globe
containing
itself
a
spherical
nucleus
from
this
were
evolved
gradually
two
distinct
forms
one
resembling
very
much
some
of
the
simplest
of
those
transparent
creatures
which
the
microscope
exhibits
to
us
in
the
water
drop
active
fierce
destructive
in
their
scale
of
size
and
life
as
the
most
powerful
animals
of
the
sea
and
land
the
other
was
a
tiny
fragment
of
tissue
gradually
shaping
itself
into
the
simplest
and
smallest
specimens
of
vegetable
life
the
watery
globe
disappeared
and
these
two
were
left
alone
from
each
gradually
emerged
growing
in
size
complexity
and
distinctness
one
form
after
another
of
higher
organisation
what
seest
thou
life
called
out
of
lifelessness
by
law
again
so
gradually
that
no
step
of
the
process
could
be
separately
distinguished
formed
a
panorama
of
vegetable
and
animal
life
a
landscape
in
which
appeared
some
dozen
primal
shapes
of
either
kingdom
each
of
these
gradually
dissolved
passing
by
slow
degrees
into
several
higher
or
more
perfect
shapes
till
there
stood
before
our
eyes
a
picture
of
life
as
it
exists
at
present
and
man
in
its
midst
more
obviously
even
than
on
earth
dominating
and
subduing
the
of
whom
he
is
lord
from
which
of
the
innumerable
animal
forms
that
had
been
presented
to
us
in
the
course
of
these
transmutations
this
supreme
form
had
arisen
i
did
not
note
or
can
not
remember
but
that
no
true
ape
appeared
among
them
i
do
distinctly
recollect
having
been
on
the
watch
for
the
representation
of
such
an
epoch
in
the
pictured
history
what
was
now
especially
noteworthy
was
that
solid
as
they
appeared
each
form
was
in
some
way
transparent
from
the
emblem
before
mentioned
a
light
pervaded
the
scene
scarcely
discernible
in
the
general
atmosphere
faintly
but
distinctly
traceable
in
every
herb
shrub
and
tree
more
distinguishable
and
concentrated
in
each
animal
but
in
plant
or
animal
the
condensed
light
was
never
separated
and
individualised
never
parted
from
though
obviously
gathered
and
agglomerated
out
of
the
generally
diffused
rosy
sheen
that
tinged
the
entire
landscape
it
was
as
though
the
light
formed
an
atmosphere
which
entered
and
passed
freely
through
the
tissues
of
each
animal
and
plant
but
brightened
and
deepened
in
those
portions
which
at
any
moment
pervaded
any
organised
shape
while
it
flowed
freely
in
and
out
of
all
the
concentration
was
most
marked
the
connection
with
the
diffused
atmosphere
least
perceptible
in
those
most
intelligent
creatures
like
the
and
which
in
the
service
of
man
appear
to
have
acquired
a
portion
of
human
intelligence
but
turning
to
the
type
of
man
himself
the
light
within
his
body
had
assumed
the
shape
of
the
frame
it
filled
and
appeared
to
animate
in
him
the
image
which
exactly
corresponded
to
the
body
that
encased
it
was
perfectly
individualised
and
had
no
other
connection
with
the
remainder
of
the
light
than
that
it
appeared
to
emanate
and
to
be
fed
from
the
original
source
as
i
looked
the
outward
body
dissolved
the
image
of
rosy
light
stood
alone
as
human
and
far
more
beautiful
than
before
rose
upward
and
passed
away
what
seest
thou
was
uttered
in
an
even
more
earnest
and
solemn
tone
than
heretofore
life
i
said
physical
and
spiritual
the
one
sustained
by
the
other
the
spiritual
emanating
from
the
source
of
life
pervading
all
living
forms
affording
to
each
the
degree
of
individuality
and
of
intelligence
needful
to
it
but
in
none
forming
an
individual
entity
apart
from
the
race
save
in
man
himself
and
in
man
forming
the
individual
being
whereof
the
flesh
is
but
the
clothing
and
the
instrument
the
whole
scene
suddenly
vanished
in
total
darkness
only
again
in
one
direction
a
gleam
of
light
appeared
and
guided
us
to
a
portal
through
which
we
entered
another
long
and
narrow
passage
terminating
in
a
second
vestibule
before
a
door
of
emerald
crystal
brilliantly
illuminated
by
a
light
within
here
again
our
steps
were
arrested
the
door
was
guarded
by
two
sentries
in
whom
i
recognised
initiates
of
the
order
wearers
of
the
silver
sash
and
star
the
password
and
sign
whispered
to
me
as
we
left
the
hall
of
the
novitiate
having
been
given
the
door
parted
and
exposed
to
our
view
the
inmost
chamber
a
scene
calculated
to
strike
the
eye
and
impress
the
mind
not
more
by
its
splendour
and
magnificence
than
by
the
unexpected
character
it
displayed
it
represented
a
garden
but
the
boundaries
were
concealed
by
the
branching
trees
the
arches
of
flowering
creepers
the
thickets
of
flowers
shrubs
and
tall
reeds
which
in
every
direction
imitated
so
perfectly
the
natural
forms
that
the
closest
scrutiny
would
have
been
required
to
detect
their
artificiality
the
general
form
however
seemed
to
be
that
of
a
square
entered
by
a
very
short
narrow
passage
and
divided
by
broad
paths
forming
a
cross
of
equal
arms
at
the
central
point
of
this
cross
was
placed
on
a
pedestal
of
emerald
a
statue
in
gold
which
recalled
at
once
the
features
of
the
founder
the
space
might
have
accommodated
two
thousand
persons
but
on
the
seats
of
a
material
resembling
ivory
each
of
them
separately
formed
and
gathered
in
irregular
clusters
there
were
not
i
thought
more
than
four
hundred
or
five
hundred
men
and
women
intermingled
the
former
dressed
for
the
most
part
in
green
the
latter
in
pink
or
white
and
all
wearing
the
silver
band
and
star
at
the
opposite
end
closing
the
central
aisle
was
a
low
narrow
platform
raised
by
two
steps
carved
out
of
the
natural
rock
but
inlaid
with
jewellery
imitating
closely
the
variegated
turf
of
a
real
garden
on
this
were
placed
slanting
backward
towards
the
centre
two
rows
of
six
golden
seats
or
thrones
whose
occupants
wore
the
golden
band
over
silver
robes
that
next
the
interval
but
to
the
left
was
filled
by
esmo
who
to
my
surprise
wore
a
robe
of
white
completely
covering
his
figure
and
contrasting
signally
the
golden
sash
to
which
his
star
was
attached
on
his
left
arm
bare
below
the
elbow
i
noticed
a
flat
thick
band
of
plain
gold
with
an
emerald
seal
bearing
the
same
proportion
to
the
bracelet
as
a
large
signet
to
its
finger
ring
what
struck
me
at
once
as
most
remarkable
was
that
the
seats
on
the
dais
and
the
forms
of
their
occupiers
were
signally
relieved
against
a
background
of
intense
darkness
whose
nature
however
i
could
not
discern
the
roof
was
in
form
a
truncated
pyramid
its
material
a
crystal
through
which
a
clear
soft
light
illuminated
the
whole
scene
across
the
floor
of
the
entrance
immediately
within
the
portal
was
a
broad
band
of
the
same
crystal
marking
the
formal
threshold
of
the
hall
immediately
inside
this
stood
the
same
chief
who
had
received
us
in
the
former
hall
and
as
we
stood
at
the
door
stretching
forth
his
left
hand
he
spoke
or
rather
chanted
what
by
the
rhythmical
sequence
of
the
words
by
the
frequent
recurrence
of
alliteration
and
irregular
rhyme
was
evidently
a
formula
committed
to
the
verse
of
the
martial
tongue
a
formula
like
all
those
of
the
order
never
written
but
handed
down
by
memory
and
therefore
perhaps
cast
in
a
shape
which
rendered
accurate
remembrance
easier
and
more
certain
ye
who
lost
in
outer
night
reach
at
last
the
source
of
light
ask
ye
in
that
light
to
dwell
none
we
urge
and
none

opens
at
your
touch
the
door
bright
within
the
lamp
of
lore
yet
beware
the
threshold

the
bond
the

or

to

i
asked
a
voice
on
my
left
murmured
in
a
low
tone
the
formula
which
i
repeated
eveena
accompanying
my
words
in
an
almost
inaudible
whisper
within
the
shrine
eyes

see
or
soul

swear
we
secret
as
the

silent
as
the
urn

we
claim
to

by
the
fount
of
light
we
swear
as
these
words
were
uttered
i
became
aware
that
some
change
had
taken
place
at
the
further
end
of
the
hall
looking
up
the
dark
background
had
disappeared
and
under
a
species
of
deep
archway
behind
the
seats
of
the
chiefs
was
visible
a
wall
diapered
in
ruby
and
gold
and
displaying
in
various
interwoven
patterns
the
several
symbols
of
the
zinta
towards
the
roof
exactly
in
the
centre
was
a
large
silver
star
emitting
a
light
resembling
that
which
the
full
moon
sheds
on
a
tropical
scene
but
far
more
brilliant
around
this
was
a
broad
golden
circle
or
band
and
beneath
the
silver
image
of
a
serpent
perfectly
reproducing
a
typical
terrestrial
snake
but
coiled
as
no
snake
ever
coils
itself
in
a
double
circle
or
figure
of
eight
with
the
tail
wound
around
the
neck
on
the
left
was
a
crimson
shield
or
what
seemed
to
be
such
small
round
and
swelling
in
the
centre
into
a
sharp
point
on
the
right
three
crossed
spears
of
silver
with
crimson
blades
pointed
upward
but
the
most
remarkable
object
immediately
filling
the
interval
between
the
seats
of
the
chiefs
and
carved
from
a
huge
cubic
block
of
emerald
was
a
throne
ascended
on
each
side
by
five
or
six
steps
the
upper
step
or
seat
extending
nearly
across
the
whole
some
two
feet
below
the
surface
the
next
forming
a
footstool
thereto
above
this
was
a
canopy
seemingly
of
circular
form
a
chain
formed
by
interlaced
golden
circles
was
upheld
by
four
great
emerald
wings
within
the
chain
again
was
the
silver
serpent
coiled
as
before
and
resting
upon
a
surface
of
foliage
and
flowers
in
the
centre
of
all
was
repeated
the
silver
star
within
the
golden
band
the
emblem
from
which
the
order
derives
its
name
and
in
which
it
embodies
its
deepest
symbolism
following
again
the
direction
of
my
unseen
prompter
i
repeated
words
which
may
be
roughly
translated
as
follows
by
the
outer
night
of
gloom
by
the
ray
that
leads
us
home

the
light

claim
to

rising
from

and

immediately
before
and
to
the
left
of
the

esmo
replied
but
before
he
had
spoken
words
a
pressure
on
my
arm
drew
my
eyes
from
him
to
eveena
she
stood
fixed
as
if
turned
to
stone
in
an
attitude
which
for
one
fleeting
instant
recalled
that
of
the
sculptured
figures
undergoing
sudden
petrifaction
at
the
sight
of
the
gorgon
head
this
remembered
resemblance
or
an
instinctive
sympathy
at
once
conveyed
to
me
the
consciousness
that
the
absolute
stillness
of
her
attitude
expressed
a
horror
or
an
awe
too
deep
for
trembling
looking
into
her
eyes
which
alone
were
visible
their
gaze
fixed
intently
on
the
throne
at
once
caught
and
controlled
my
own
and
raising
my
eyes
again
to
the
same
point
i
stood
almost
equally
petrified
by
consternation
and
amazement
i
need
not
say
how
many
marvels
of
no
common
character
i
have
seen
on
earth
how
many
visions
that
if
i
told
them
none
who
have
not
shared
them
would
believe
wonders
that
the
few
who
have
seen
them
can
never
forget
nor
despite
all
experience
and
all
theoretical
explanation
recall
without
renewing
the
thrill
of
dismay
with
which
the
sight
was
first
beheld
but
no
marvel
of
the
mystic
schools
no
spectral
scene
objective
or
subjective
ever
evoked
by
the
rarest
of
occult
powers
so
startled
so
impressed
me
as
what
i
now
saw
or
thought
i
saw
the
throne
on
which
but
a
few
moments
before
my
eyes
had
been
steadily
fixed
and
which
had
then
assuredly
been
vacant
was
now
occupied
and
occupied
by
a
presence
which
though
not
seen
in
the
flesh
for
ages
none
who
had
ever
looked
on
the
portrait
that
represented
it
could
forget
or
mistake
the
form
the
dress
the
long
white
hair
and
beard
the
grave
dignified
countenance
above
all
the
deep
scrutinising
piercing
eyes
of
the
founder
as
i
had
seen
them
on
a
single
occasion
in
esmo
house
were
now
as
clearly
as
forcibly
presented
to
my
sight
as
any
figure
in
the
flesh
i
ever
beheld
the
eyes
were
turned
on
me
with
a
calm
searching
steady
gaze
whose
effect
was
such
as
southey
ascribes
to
indra
the
look
he
gave
was
solemn
not
severe
no
hope
to
kailyal
it
conveyed
and
yet
it
struck
no
fear
for
a
moment
they
rested
on
eveena
veiled
and
drooping
figure
with
a
widely
different
expression
that
look
as
i
thought
spoke
a
grave
but
passionless
regret
or
pity
as
of
one
who
sees
a
child
unconsciously
on
the
verge
of
peril
or
sorrow
that
admits
neither
of
warning
nor
rescue
that
look
happily
she
did
not
read
but
we
both
saw
the
same
object
and
in
the
same
instant
we
both
stood
amazed
and
appalled
long
enough
to
render
our
hesitation
not
only
apparent
but
striking
to
all
around
many
of
whom
following
the
direction
of
my
gaze
turned
their
eyes
upon
the
throne
what
they
saw
or
did
not
see
i
know
not
and
did
not
then
care
to
think
the
following
formula
pronounced
by
esmo
had
fallen
not
unheard
but
almost
unheeded
on
my
ears
though
one
passage
harmonised
strangely
with
the
sight
before
me
passing
sign
and
fleeting
breath
bind
the
soul
for
life
and
death
lifted
hand
and
plighted
word
eyes
have
seen
and
ears
have
heard
eyes
have
seen
nor
ours
alone
fell
the
sound
on
ears
unknown
labour
strand
by
strand
forged
the
immemorial
band
never
thread
hath
known
decay
never
link
hath
dropped
away
here
he
paused
and
beckoned
us
to
advance
the
sign
twice
repeated
before
i
could
obey
it
at
last
broke
the
spell
that
enthralled
me
under
the
most
astounding
or
circumstances
instinct
moves
our
limbs
almost
in
our
own
despite
and
leads
us
to
do
with
paralysed
will
what
has
been
intended
or
is
expected
of
us
this
instinct
and
no
conscious
resolve
to
overcome
the
influence
that
held
me
enabled
me
to
proceed
and
i
led
eveena
forward
by
actual
if
gentle
force
till
we
reached
the
lower
step
of
the
platform
here
at
a
sign
from
her
father
we
knelt
while
laying
his
hands
on
our
heads
and
stooping
to
kiss
each
upon
the
brow
eveena
raising
her
veil
for
one
moment
and
dropping
it
again
he
continued
so
we
greet
you
evermore
brethren
of
the
deathless
lore
so
your
vows
our
own
renew
sworn
to
all
as
each
to
you
yours
at
once
the
secrets
won
age
by
age
from
sire
to
son
yours
the
fruit
through
countless
years
grown
by
thought
and
toil
and
tears
he
who
guards
you
guards
his
own
he
who
fails
you
fails
the
throne
the
last
two
lines
were
repeated
as
by
a
simultaneous
impulse
in
a
low
but
audible
tone
by
the
whole
assembly
in
the
meantime
esmo
had
invested
each
of
us
with
the
symbol
of
our
enrolment
in
the
zinta
the
silver
sash
and
star
of
the
initiates
the
ceremonial
seemed
to
me
to
afford
that
sort
of
religious
sanction
and
benediction
which
had
been
so
signally
wanting
to
the
original
form
of
our
union
as
we
rose
i
turned
my
eyes
for
a
moment
upon
the
throne
now
vacant
as
at
first
another
chief
followed
by
the
voices
of
the
assembly
repeated
in
a
low
deep
tone
which
fell
on
our
ears
as
distinctly
as
the
loudest
in
the
midst
of
absolute
silence
the
solemn
imprecation
who
denies
a
brother
need
who
in
will
or
word
or
deed
breaks
the
circle
bounded
line
rends
the
veil
that
guards
the
shrine
lifts
the
hand
to
lips
that
lie
fronts
the
star
with
soothless
eye
dreams
of
horror
haunt
his
rest
storms
of
madness
vex
his
breast
snares
surround
him
death
beset
man
forsake
and
god
forget
it
was
probably
rather
the
tone
of
profound
conviction
and
almost
tremulous
awe
with
which
these
words
were
slowly
enunciated
by
the
entire
assemblage
than
their
actual
sense
though
the
latter
is
greatly
weakened
by
my
translation
that
gave
them
an
effect
on
my
own
mind
such
as
no
oath
and
no
rite
however
solemn
no
religious
ceremonial
no
forms
of
the
most
secret
mysteries
had
ever
produced
i
was
not
surprised
that
eveena
was
far
more
deeply
affected
even
the
earlier
words
of
the
imprecation
had
caused
her
to
shudder
and
ere
it
closed
she
would
have
sunk
to
the
ground
but
for
the
support
of
my
arm
disengaging
the
bracelet
esmo
held
out
to
our
lips
the
signet
which
as
i
now
perceived
reproduced
in
miniature
the
symbols
that
formed
the
canopy
above
the
throne
a
few
moments
of
deep
and
solemn
silence
had
elapsed
when
one
of
the
chiefs
who
except
esmo
had
now
resumed
their
seats
rose
and
addressing
himself
to
the
latter
said
the
initiate
has
shown
in
the
hall
of
the
vision
a
knowledge
of
the
sense
embodied
in
our
symbols
of
the
creed
and
thoughts
drawn
from
them
which
he
can
hardly
have
learned
in
the
few
hours
that
have
elapsed
since
you
first
spoke
to
him
of
their
existence
if
there
be
not
in
his
world
those
who
have
wrought
out
for
themselves
similar
truths
in
not
dissimilar
forms
he
must
possess
a
rare
and
almost
instinctive
power
to
appreciate
the
lessons
we
can
teach
i
will
ask
your
permission
therefore
to
put
to
him
but
one
question
and
that
the
deepest
and
most
difficult
of
all
esmo
merely
bent
his
head
in
reply
can
you
said
the
speaker
turning
to
me
with
marked
courtesy
draw
meaning
or
lesson
from
the
coil
of
the
serpent
i
need
not
repeat
an
answer
which
to
those
familiar
with
the
oldest
language
of
terrestrial
symbolism
would
have
occurred
as
readily
as
to
myself
and
which
if
they
could
understand
it
it
would
not
be
well
to
explain
to
others
the
three
principal
elements
of
thought
represented
by
the
serpent
are
the
same
in
mars
as
on
earth
confirming
in
so
far
the
doctrine
of
the
zinta
that
their
symbolic
language
is
not
arbitrary
but
natural
formed
on
principles
inherent
in
the
correspondence
between
things
spiritual
and
physical
some
similar
but
trivial
query
whose
purport
i
have
now
forgotten
was
addressed
by
the
junior
of
the
chiefs
to
eveena
and
i
was
struck
by
the
patient
courtesy
with
which
he
waited
till
after
two
or
three
efforts
she
sufficiently
recovered
her
to
understand
and
her
voice
to
answer
we
then
retired
taking
our
place
on
seats
remote
from
the
platform
and
at
some
distance
from
any
of
our
neighbours
on
a
formal
invitation
one
after
another
of
the
brethren
rose
and
read
a
brief
account
of
some
experiment
or
discovery
in
the
science
of
the
order
the
principles
taken
for
granted
as
fundamental
and
notorious
truths
far
transcend
the
extremest
speculations
of
terrestrial
mysticism
the
powers
claimed
as
of
course
so
infinitely
exceed
anything
alleged
by
the
most
ardent
believers
in
mesmerism
clairvoyance
or
spiritualism
that
it
would
be
useless
to
relate
the
few
among
these
experiments
which
i
remember
and
might
be
permitted
to
repeat
i
observed
that
a
phonographic
apparatus
of
a
peculiarly
elaborate
character
wrote
down
every
word
of
these
accounts
without
obliging
the
speakers
to
approach
it
and
i
was
informed
that
this
automatic
reporting
is
employed
in
every
martial
assembly
scientific
political
or
judicial
i
listened
with
extreme
interest
and
was
more
than
satisfied
that
esmo
had
even
underrated
the
powers
claimed
by
and
for
the
lowest
and
least
intelligent
of
his
brethren
when
he
said
that
these
and
these
alone
could
give
efficient
protection
or
signal
vengeance
against
all
the
tremendous
physical
forces
at
command
of
those
state
authorities
one
of
the
greatest
of
whom
i
had
made
my
personal
enemy
one
battalion
of
martial
guards
or
police
accompanied
by
a
single
battery
of
what
i
may
call
their
artillery
might
even
without
the
aid
of
a
in
annihilate
or
scatter
to
the
winds
the
mightiest
and
bravest
army
that
europe
could
send
forth
yet
the
martial
state
had
deliberately
and
i
think
with
only
a
due
prudence
shrunk
during
ages
from
an
open
conflict
of
power
with
the
few
thousand
members
of
this
secret
but
inevitably
suspected
organisation
esmo
called
on
me
in
my
turn
to
give
such
account
as
i
might
choose
of
my
own
world
and
my
journey
thence
i
frankly
avowed
my
indisposition
to
explain
the
generation
and
action
of
the
apergic
force
the
power
which
a
concurrent
knowledge
of
two
separate
kinds
of
science
had
given
to
a
very
few
terrestrials
and
which
all
the
science
of
a
far
more
enlightened
race
had
failed
to
attain
was
in
my
conscientious
conviction
a
providential
trust
withheld
from
those
in
whose
hands
it
might
be
a
fearful
temptation
and
an
instrument
of
unbounded
evil
my
reserve
was
perfectly
intelligible
to
the
children
of
the
star
and
evidently
raised
me
in
their
estimation
i
was
much
impressed
by
the
simple
and
unaffected
reliance
placed
on
my
statements
as
on
those
of
every
other
member
of
the
order
as
a
rule
martialists
are
both
and
not
without
reason
to
believe
any
unsupported
statement
that
might
be
prompted
by
interest
or
vanity
but
the
can
trust
one
another
word
more
fully
than
the
followers
of
mahomet
that
of
his
strictest
disciples
or
the
most
honest
nations
of
the
west
the
most
solemn
oaths
of
their
citizens
while
that
bigotry
of
scientific
unbelief
that
narrowness
of
thought
which
prevails
among
their
countrymen
has
been
dispelled
by
their
wider
studies
and
loftier
interests
they
have
a
saying
whose
purport
might
be
rendered
in
the
proverbial
language
of
the
aryans
by
saying
that
the
liar
kills
the
goose
that
lays
the
golden
eggs
again
the
liar
is
like
an
opiatised
tunneller
miner
more
likely
to
blow
himself
to
pieces
than
to
effect
his
purpose
again
the
liar
drives
the
point
into
a
friend
heart
and
puts
the
hilt
into
a
foe
hand
the
maxim
that
a
lie
is
a
shield
in
sore
need
but
the
spear
of
a
scoundrel
affirms
the
right
in
extremity
to
preserve
a
secret
from
impertinent
inquisitiveness
rarely
but
on
some
peculiarly
important
occasions
the
zveltau
avouch
their
sincerity
by
an
appeal
to
their
own
symbols
and
it
is
affirmed
that
an
oath
attested
by
the
circle
and
the
star
has
never
in
the
lapse
of
ages
been
broken
or
evaded
before
midnight
esmo
dismissed
the
assembly
by
a
formula
which
dimly
recalled
to
memory
one
heard
in
my
boyhood
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
my
translation
to
preserve
the
impressive
solemnity
of
the
immemorial
ritual
of
the
zinta
deepened
alike
by
the
earnestness
of
its
delivery
and
the
reverence
of
the
hearers
there
was
something
majestic
in
the
mere
antiquity
of
a
liturgy
whereof
no
word
has
ever
been
committed
to
writing
five
hundred
generations
have
it
is
alleged
gathered
four
times
in
each
year
in
the
hall
of
initiation
and
every
meeting
has
been
concluded
by
the
utterance
from
the
same
spot
and
in
the
same
words
of
the
solemn
but
simple
word
of

gave
me
two
or
three
articles
to
which
he
attached
especial
value
the
most
important
of
these
was
a
small
cube
of
translucent
stone
in
which
a
multitude
of
diversely
coloured
fragments
were
combined
so
set
in
a
tiny
swivel
or
swing
of
gold
that
it
might
be
conveniently
attached

terrestrial
article

poison
is
perhaps
the
weapon
least
unlikely
to
be
employed
against
you
when
known
to
be
connected
with
myself

i
will
hope
to
possess
the
favour
of

a

of
great
power
i
need
not
warn
you
to
be
careful

you
give
to
any
one

shown
you
the

an
hour
after

next
morning
esmo
his
son
and
our
host
accompanied
us
to
the
vessel
in
which
we
were
to
make
the
principal
part
of
our
journey
we
were
received
by
an
officer
of

royal
court
who
was
to
accompany
us
during
the
rest
of
our
journey
and
from
whom
esrno
assured
me
i
might
obtain
the
fullest
information
regarding
the
various
objects
of
interest
to
visit

we
had
adopted

and
the
arctic
circle
as
this
was
the
summer
of
the
northern
hemisphere
we
should
thus
enjoy
a
longer
day
and
should
not
suffer
from
the
change
of
climate
after
taking
leave
of
our
friends
we
went
down
below
to
take
possession
of
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
which
was
assigned
as
our
exclusive
quarters
immediately
in
front
of
the
which
occupied
the
centre
of
the
vessel
were
two
cabins
about
sixteen
feet
square
reaching
from
side
to
side
beyond
these
opening
out
of
a
passage
running
along
one
side
were
two
smaller
cabins
about
eight
feet
long
all
these
apartments
were
furnished
and
ornamented
with
the
luxury
and
elegance
of
chambers
in
the
best
houses
on
shore
in
the
foremost
of
the
larger
cabins
were
a
couple
of
desks
and
three
or
four
writing
or
easy
chairs
in
the
outer
cabin
nearest
to
the
and
entered
immediately
by
the
ladder
descending
from
the
deck
was
fixed
a
low
central
table
in
all
we
found
abundance
of
those
soft
exquisitely
covered
and
embroidered
cushions
which
in
mars
as
in
oriental
countries
are
the
most
essential
and
most
luxurious
furniture
the
officer
had
quarters
in
the
stern
of
the
vessel
which
was
an
exact
copy
of
the
fore
part
but
the
first
of
these
rooms
was
considered
as
public
or
neutral
ground
leaving
eveena
below
i
went
on
deck
to
examine
before
she
started
the
construction
of
the
vessel
her
entire
length
was
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
her
depth
from
the
flat
deck
to
the
wide
keel
about
one
half
of
her
breadth
the
height
of
the
cabins
not
much
more
than
eight
feet
her
draught
when
most
completely
lightened
not
more
than
four
feet
her
electric
machinery
drew
in
and
drove
out
with
great
force
currents
of
water
which
propelled
her
with
a
speed
greater
than
that
afforded
by
the
most
powerful
paddles
it
also
pumped
in
or
out
at
whatever
depth
the
quantity
of
water
required
as
ballast
not
merely
to
steady
the
vessel
but
to
keep
her
in
position
on
the
surface
or
to
sink
her
to
the
level
at
which
the
pilot
might
choose
to
sail
at
either
end
was
fixed
a
steering
screw
much
resembling
the
of
a
fish
capable
of
striking
sideways
upwards
or
downwards
and
directing
our
course
accordingly
ergimo
our
escort
had
not
yet
reached
middle
age
but
was
a
man
of
exceptional
intellect
and
unusual
knowledge
he
had
made
many
voyages
and
had
occupied
for
some
time
an
important
official
post
on
one
of
those
arctic
continents
which
are
inhabited
only
by
the
hunters
employed
in
collecting
the
furs
and
skins
furnished
exclusively
by
these
lands
the
shores
of
the
gulf
were
lofty
rocky
and
uninteresting
it
was
difficult
to
see
any
object
on
shore
from
the
deck
of
the
vessel
and
i
assented
therefore
without
demur
after
the
first
hour
of
the
voyage
to
his
proposal
that
the
lights
answering
to
our
hatches
should
be
closed
and
that
the
vessel
should
pursue
her
course
below
the
surface
this
was
the
more
desirable
that
though
winds
and
storms
are
as
i
have
said
rare
these
long
and
narrow
seas
with
their
lofty
shores
are
exposed
to
rough
currents
atmospheric
and
marine
which
render
a
voyage
on
the
surface
no
more
agreeable
than
a
passage
in
average
weather
across
the
bay
of
biscay
after
descending
i
was
occupied
for
some
time
in
studying
with
ergimo
assistance
the
arrangement
of
the
machinery
and
the
simple
process
by
which
electric
force
is
generated
in
quantities
adequate
to
any
effort
at
a
marvellously
small
expenditure
of
material
in
this
form
the
martialists
assert
that
they
obtain
without
waste
all
the
potential
energy
stored
in
about
half
a
score
lines
or
two
pages
of
an
ordinary
octavo
volume
like
this
are
here
illegible
she
eveena
was
somewhat
pale
but
rose
quickly
and
greeted
me
with
a
smile
of
unaffected
cheerfulness
and
was
evidently
surprised
as
well
as
pleased
that
i
was
content
to
remain
alone
with
her
our
conversation
turning
chiefly
on
the
lessons
of
last
night
our
time
passed
quickly
till
about
the
middle
of
the
day
we
were
startled
by
a
shock
which
as
i
thought
must
be
due
to
our
having
run
aground
or
struck
against
a
rock
but
when
i
passed
into
the
ergimo
explained
that
the
pilot
was
nowise
in
fault
we
had
encountered
one
of
those
inconveniences
hardly
to
be
called
perils
which
are
peculiar
to
the
waters
of
mars
though
animals
hostile
or
dangerous
to
man
have
been
almost
extirpated
upon
the
land
creatures
of
a
type
long
since
supposed
to
be
extinct
on
earth
still
haunt
the
depths
of
the
martial
seas
and
one
of
these
a
real
of
above
a
hundred
feet
in
length
and
perhaps
eight
feet
in
circumference
had
attacked
our
vessel
entangling
the
steering
screw
in
his
folds
and
trying
to
crush
it
checking
at
the
same
time
by
his
tremendous
force
the
motion
of
the
vessel
we
shall
soon
get
rid
of
him
though
said
ergimo
as
i
followed
him
to
the
stern
to
watch
with
great
interest
the
method
of
dealing
with
the
monster
whose
strange
form
was
visible
through
a
thick
crystal
pane
in
the
the
asphyxiator
could
not
have
been
used
without
great
risk
to
ourselves
but
several
tubes
filled
with
a
soft
material
resembling
cork
originally
the
pith
of
a
martial
cane
of
great
size
were
inserted
in
the
floor
sides
and
deck
of
the
vessel
and
through
the
centre
of
each
of
these
passed
a
strong
metallic
wire
of
great
conducting
power
two
or
three
of
those
in
the
stern
were
placed
in
contact
with
some
of
the
electric
machinery
by
which
the
rudder
was
usually
turned
and
through
them
were
sent
rapid
and
energetic
currents
whose
passage
rendered
the
covering
of
the
wires
notwithstanding
their
great
conductivity
too
hot
to
be
touched
we
heard
immediately
a
smothered
sound
of
extraordinary
character
which
was
in
truth
no
other
than
a
scream
deadened
partly
by
the
water
partly
by
the
thick
metal
sheet
interposed
between
us
and
the
element
the
steering
screw
was
set
in
rapid
motion
and
at
first
revolving
with
some
difficulty
afterwards
moving
faster
and
more
regularly
presently
released
us
its
rotation
was
stopped
and
we
resumed
our
course
the
serpent
had
relaxed
his
folds
stunned
by
the
shock
but
had
not
disentangled
himself
from
the
screw
till
its
blades
no
longer
checked
by
the
tremendous
force
of
his
original
grasp
striking
him
a
series
of
terrific
blows
had
broken
the
vertebrae
and
paralysed
if
not
killed
the
monstrous
enemy
at
each
side
of
the
larger
chambers
and
of
the
were
fixed
small
thick
circular
windows
through
which
we
could
see
from
time
to
time
the
more
remarkable
objects
in
the
water
we
passed
along
one
curious
submarine
bank
built
somewhat
like
our
coral
rocks
not
by
insects
however
but
by
shellfish
which
fixing
themselves
as
soon
as
hatched
on
the
shells
below
or
around
them
extended
slowly
upward
and
sideways
as
each
of
these
creatures
perished
the
shell
about
half
the
size
of
an
oyster
was
filled
with
the
same
sort
of
material
as
that
of
which
its
hexagonic
walls
were
originally
formed
drawn
in
by
the
surrounding
and
still
living
neighbours
and
thus
in
the
course
of
centuries
were
constructed
solid
reefs
of
enormous
extent
one
of
these
had
run
right
across
the
gulf
forming
a
complete
bridge
ceasing
however
within
some
five
feet
of
the
surface
but
on
this
a
regular
roadway
had
been
constructed
by
human
art
and
mechanical
labour
while
underneath
at
the
usual
depth
of
thirty
feet
several
tunnels
had
been
pierced
each
large
enough
to
admit
the
passage
of
a
single
vessel
of
the
largest
size
at
every
fourth
hour
our
vessel
rose
to
the
surface
to
renew
her
atmosphere
which
was
thus
kept
purer
than
that
of
an
ordinary
atlantic
packet
between
decks
while
the
temperature
was
maintained
at
an
agreeable
point
by
the
warmth
diffused
from
the
electric
machinery
on
the
sixth
day
of
our
voyage
we
reached
a
point
where
the
gulf
of
serocasfe
divides
a
sharp
jutting
cape
or
peninsula
parting
its
waters
we
took
the
northern
branch
about
fifteen
miles
in
width
and
here
rising
to
the
surface
and
steering
a
zigzag
course
from
coast
to
coast
i
was
enabled
to
see
something
of
the
character
of
this
most
extraordinary
strait
its
walls
at
first
were
no
less
than
feet
in
height
so
that
at
all
times
we
were
in
sight
so
to
speak
of
land
a
road
had
been
cut
along
the
and
here
and
there
tunnels
ascending
through
the
rock
rendered
this
accessible
from
the
plateau
above
the
strata
as
upon
earth
were
of
various
character
none
of
them
very
thick
seldom
reproducing
exactly
the
geology
of
our
own
planet
but
seldom
very
widely
deviating
in
character
from
the
rocks
with
which
we
are
acquainted
the
lowest
were
evidently
of
the
same
hard
fused
compressed
character
as
those
which
our
terminology
calls
plutonic
above
these
were
masses
which
bike
the
carboniferous
strata
of
earth
recalled
the
previous
existence
of
a
richer
but
less
highly
organised
form
of
vegetation
than
at
present
exists
anywhere
upon
the
surface
intermixed
with
these
were
beds
of
the
peculiar
submarine
whose
formation
i
have
just
described
above
these
again
come
strata
of
diluvial
gravel
and
about
feet
below
the
surface
rocks
that
bore
evident
traces
of
a
glacial
period
as
we
approached
the
lower
end
of
the
gulf
the
shores
sloped
constantly
downward
and
where
they
were
no
more
than
feet
in
height
i
was
able
to
distinguish
an
upper
stratum
of
some
forty
yards
in
depth
preserving
through
its
whole
extent
traces
of
human
life
and
even
of
civilisation
this
implied
if
fairly
representative
of
the
rest
of
the
planet
crust
an
existence
of
man
upon
its
surface
ten
twenty
or
even
a
longer
than
he
is
supposed
to
have
enjoyed
upon
earth
about
noon
on
the
seventh
day
we
entered
the
canal
which
connects
this
arm
of
the
gulf
with
the
sea
of
the
northern
temperate
zone
it
varies
in
height
from
to
feet
in
width
from
to
yards
its
channel
never
exceeds
feet
in
depth
ergimo
explained
that
the
length
had
been
thought
to
render
a
tunnel
unsuitable
as
the
ordinary
method
of
ventilation
could
hardly
have
been
made
to
work
and
to
ventilate
such
a
tunnel
through
shafts
sunk
to
so
great
a
depth
would
have
been
almost
as
costly
as
the
method
actually
adopted
a
much
smaller
breadth
might
have
been
thought
to
suffice
and
was
at
first
intended
but
it
was
found
that
the
current
in
a
narrow
channel
the
outer
sea
being
many
inches
higher
than
the
water
of
the
gulf
would
have
been
too
rapid
and
violent
for
safety
the
work
had
occupied
fifteen
martial
years
and
had
been
opened
only
for
some
eight
centuries
the
water
was
not
more
than
twenty
feet
in
depth
but
the
channel
was
so
perfectly
scoured
by
the
current
that
no
obstacle
had
ever
arisen
and
no
expense
had
been
incurred
to
keep
it
a
clear
we
entered
the
northern
sea
where
a
bay
ran
up
some
half
dozen
miles
towards
the
end
of
the
gulf
shortening
the
canal
by
this
distance
the
bay
itself
was
shallow
the
only
channel
being
scarcely
wider
than
the
canal
and
created
or
preserved
by
the
current
setting
in
to
the
latter
a
current
which
offered
a
very
perceptible
resistance
to
our
course
and
satisfied
me
that
had
the
canal
been
no
wider
than
the
convenience
of
navigation
would
have
required
in
the
absence
of
such
a
stream
its
force
would
have
rendered
the
work
altogether
useless
we
crossed
the
sea
holding
on
in
the
same
direction
and
a
little
before
sunset
moored
our
vessel
at
the
wharf
of
a
small
harbour
along
the
sides
of
which
was
built
the
largest
town
of
this
subarctic
landbelt

fifty
houses

ergimo
landed
to
make
arrangements
for
the
chase
to
witness
which
was
the
principal
object
of
this
deviation
from
what
would
otherwise
have
been
our
most
convenient
course
not
only
would
it
be
possible
to
take
part
in
the
pursuit
of
the
wild
fauna
of
the
continent
but
i
also
hoped
to
share
in
a
novel
sport
not
unlike
a
in
bay
a
large
inland
sea
occupying
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
area
of
this
belt
lay
immediately
to
the
northward
and
one
wide
arm
thereof
extended
within
a
few
miles
of
askirita
a
distance
which
notwithstanding
the
interposition
of
a
mountain
range
might
be
crossed
in
a
couple
of
hours
one
or
two
days
at
most
would
suffice
for
both
adventures
i
had
not
yet
mentioned
my
intention
to
eveena
during
the
voyage
i
had
been
much
alone
with
her
and
it
was
then
only
that
our
real
acquaintance
began
till
then
however
close
our
attachment
we
were
in
knowledge
of
each
other
character
and
thought
almost
as
strangers
while
her
painful
timidity
had
in
some
degree
worn
off
her
anxious
and
watchful
deference
was
even
more
marked
than
before
true
to
the
strange
ideas
derived
chiefly
from
her
training
partly
from
her
own
natural
character
she
was
the
more
careful
to
avoid
giving
the
slightest
pain
or
displeasure
as
she
ceased
to
fear
that
either
would
be
immediately
and
intentionally
visited
upon
herself
she
evidently
thought
that
on
this
account
there
was
the
greater
danger
lest
a
series
of
trivial
annoyances
unnoticed
at
the
time
might
cool
the
affection
she
valued
so
highly
diffident
of
her
own
charms
she
knew
how
little
hold
the
women
of
her
race
generally
have
on
the
hearts
of
men
after
the
first
fever
of
passion
has
cooled
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
realise
that
her
thoughts
or
wishes
could
truly
interest
me
that
compliance
with
her
inclinations
could
be
an
object
or
that
i
could
be
seriously
bent
on
teaching
her
to
speak
frankly
and
openly
but
as
this
new
idea
became
credible
and
familiar
her
unaffected
desire
to
comply
with
all
that
was
expected
from
her
drew
out
her
hitherto
undeveloped
powers
of
conversation
and
enabled
me
day
by
day
to
appreciate
more
thoroughly
the
real
intelligence
and
soundness
of
judgment
concealed
at
first
by
her
shyness
and
still
somewhat
obscured
by
her
childlike
simplicity
and
absolute
inexperience
in
the
latter
respect
however
she
was
of
course
at
the
less
disadvantage
with
a
stranger
to
the
manners
and
life
of
her
world
a
more
perfectly
charming
companion
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
desire
and
impossible
to
find
if
at
first
i
had
been
secretly
inclined
to
reproach
her
with
exaggerated
timidity
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
her
personal
fears
were
due
simply
to
that
nervous
susceptibility
which
even
men
of
reputed
courage
have
often
displayed
in
situations
of
sudden
and
wholly
unfamiliar
peril
her
tendency
to
overrate
all
dangers
not
merely
as
they
affected
herself
but
as
they
might
involve
others
and
above
all
her
husband
i
ascribed
to
the
ideas
and
habits
of
thought
now
for
so
many
centuries
hereditary
among
a
people
in
whom
the
fear
of
annihilation
and
the
absence
of
all
the
motives
that
impel
men
on
earth
to
face
danger
and
death
with
calmness
or
even
to
enjoy
the
excitement
of
deadly
peril
have
extinguished
manhood
itself
i
could
not
however
conceal
from
eveena
that
i
was
about
to
leave
her
for
an
adventure
which
could
not
but
seem
to
her
foolhardy
and
motiveless
she
was
more
than
terrified
when
she
understood
that
i
really
intended
to
join
the
professional
hunters
in
an
enterprise
which
even
on
their
part
is
regarded
by
their
countrymen
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
and
contempt
as
one
wherein
only
the
hope
of
large
remuneration
would
induce
any
sensible
man
to
share
and
which
from
my
utter
ignorance
of
its
conditions
must
be
obviously
still
more
dangerous
to
me
the
confidence
she
was
slowly
learning
from
what
seemed
to
her
extravagant
indulgence
to
me
simply
the
consideration
due
to
a
rational
being
wife
or
comrade
slave
or
free
first
found
expression
in
the
freedom
of
her
loving
though
provoking
expostulations
you
must
be
tired
of
me
she
said
at
last
if
you
are
so
ready
to
run
the
risk
of
parting
out
of
mere
curiosity
sheer
petulance
i
answered
you
know
well
that
you
are
dearer
to
me
every
day
as
i
learn
to
understand
you
better
but
a
man
can
not
afford
to
play
the
coward
because
marriage
has
given
new
value
to
life
and
you
might
remember
that
i
have
threefold
the
strength
which
emboldens
your
hunters
to
incur
all
the
dangers
that
seem
to
your
fancy
so
terrible
that
no
shade
of
mere
cowardice
or
feminine
affectation
influenced
her
remonstrance
was
evident
from
her
next
words
well
then
if
you
will
go
however
improper
and
outrageous
the
thing
may
be
let
me
go
with
you
i
can
not
bear
to
wait
alone
fancying
at
every
moment
what
may
be
happening
to
you
and
fearing
to
see
them
carry
you
back
wounded
or
killed
touched
by
the
unselfishness
of
her
terror
and
feeling
that
there
was
some
truth
in
her
representation
of
the
state
of
mind
in
which
she
would
spend
the
hours
of
my
absence
i
tried
to
quiet
her
by
caresses
and
soft
words
but
these
she
received
as
symptoms
of
yielding
on
my
part
and
her
persistence
brought
upon
her
at
last
the
resolute
and
somewhat
sharp
rebuke
with
which
men
think
it
natural
and
right
to
repress
the
excesses
of
feminine
fear
this
is
nonsense
eveena
you
can
not
accompany
me
and
if
you
could
your
presence
would
multiply
tenfold
the
danger
to
me
and
utterly
unnerve
me
if
any
real
difficulty
should
call
for
presence
of
mind
you
must
be
content
to
leave
me
in
the
hands
of
providence
and
allow
me
to
judge
what
becomes
a
man
and
what
results
are
worth
the
risks
they
may
involve
i
hear
ergimo
step
on
deck
and
i
must
go
and
learn
from
him
what
arrangements
he
has
been
able
to
make
for
my
escort
had
found
no
difficulty
in
providing
for
the
fulfilment
of
both
my
wishes
we
were
to
beat
the
forests
which
covered
the
southern
seabord
in
the
neighbourhood
driving
our
game
out
upon
the
open
ground
where
alone
we
should
have
a
chance
of
securing
it
by
noon
we
might
hope
to
have
seen
enough
of
this
sport
and
to
find
ourselves
at
no
great
distance
from
that
part
of
the
inland
sea
where
a
yet
more
exciting
chase
was
to
employ
the
rest
of
the
day
failing
to
bring
both
adventures
within
the
sixteen
hours
of
light
which
at
this
season
and
in
this
latitude
we
should
enjoy
we
were
to
bivouac
for
the
night
on
the
northern
and
pursue
our
aquatic
game
in
the
morning
of
the
morrow
returning
before
dark
to
our
vessel
ergimo
however
was
more
of
eveena
mind
than
of
mine
i
have
complied
he
said
with
your
wishes
as
the
camptâ
ordered
me
to
do
but
i
am
equally
bound
by
his
orders
and
by
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
in
my
opinion
you
are
running
risks
altogether
out
of
proportion
to
any
object
our
adventure
can
serve
scarcely
any
of
the
creatures
we
shall
hunt
are
other
than
very
formidable
eyen
the
therne
with
the
spikes
on
its
can
inflict
painful
if
not
dangerous
wounds
and
its
bite
is
said
to
be
not
unfrequently
venomous
you
are
not
used
to
our
methods
of
hunting
to
the
management
of
the
or
to
the
use
of
our
weapons
i
can
conceive
no
reason
why
you
should
incur
what
is
at
any
rate
a
considerable
chance
not
merely
of
death
but
of
defeating
the
whole
purpose
of
your
extraordinary
journey
simply
to
do
or
to
see
the
work
on
which
we
peril
only
the
least
valuable
lives
among
us
i
was
about
to
answer
him
even
more
decidedly
than
i
had
replied
to
eveena
when
a
pressure
on
my
arm
drew
my
eyes
in
the
other
direction
and
to
my
extreme
mortification
i
perceived
that
eveena
herself
in
eagerness
to
learn
the
opinion
of
an
intelligent
and
experienced
hunter
had
stolen
on
deck
and
had
heard
all
that
had
passed
i
was
too
much
vexed
to
make
any
other
reply
to
argument
than
the
single
word
i
shall
go
really
angry
with
her
for
the
first
and
last
time
but
not
choosing
to
express
my
displeasure
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
i
hurried
eveena
down
the
ladder
into
our
cabin
tell
me
i
said
what
according
to
your
own
rules
of
feminine
reserve
and
obedience
you
deserve
what
would
one
of
your
people
say
to
a
wife
who
followed
him
without
leave
into
the
company
of
a
stranger
to
listen
to
that
which
she
knew
she
was
not
meant
to
hear
she
answered
by
throwing
off
her
veil
and
and
standing
up
silent
before
me
answer
me
child
i
repeated
more
than
half
appeased
by
the
mute
appeal
of
her
eyes
and
submissive
attitude
i
know
you
will
not
tell
me
that
you
have
not
broken
all
the
restraints
of
your
own
laws
and
customs
what
would
your
father
for
instance
say
to
such
an
escapade
she
was
silent
till
the
touch
of
my
hand
contradicting
perhaps
the
harshness
of
my
words
encouraged
her
to
lift
her
eyes
full
of
tears
to
mine
nothing
was
her
very
unexpected
reply
nothing
i
rejoined
if
you
can
tell
me
that
you
have
not
done
wrong
i
shall
be
sorry
to
have
reproved
you
so
sharply
i
shall
tell
you
no
such
lie
she
answered
almost
indignantly
you
asked
what
would
be
i
was
fairly
at
a
loss
the
figure
which
martial
grammarians
call
the
suppressed
alternative
is
a
great
favourite
and
derives
peculiar
force
from
the
varied
emphasis
their
syntax
allows
but
resolved
not
to
understand
a
meaning
much
more
distinctly
conveyed
in
her
words
than
in
my
translation
i
replied
shall
say
nothing
then
except
do
do
it
again
and
i
extricated
myself
promptly
if
ignominiously
from
the
dilemma
by
leaving
the
cabin
and
closing
the
door
so
sharply
and
decidedly
as
to
convey
a
distinct
intimation
that
it
was
not
again
to
be
opened
we
breakfasted
earlier
than
usual
my
gentle
bride
had
been
subdued
into
a
silence
not
sullen
but
so
sad
that
when
her
wistful
eyes
followed
my
every
movement
as
i
prepared
to
start
i
could
willingly
to
bring
back
their
brightness
have
renounced
the
promise
of
the
day
but
this
must
not
be
and
turning
to
take
leave
on
the
threshold
i
said
be
sure
i
shall
come
to
no
harm
and
if
i
did
the
worst
pang
of
death
would
be
the
memory
of
the
first
sharp
words
i
have
spoken
to
you
and
which
i
confess
were
an
ill
return
for
the
inconvenient
expression
of
your
affectionate
anxiety
do
not
speak
so
she
half
whispered
i
deserved
any
mark
of
your
displeasure
i
only
wish
i
could
persuade
you
that
the
sharpest
sting
lies
in
the
lips
we
love
do
remember
since
you
would
not
let
me
run
the
slightest
risk
of
harm
that
if
you
come
to
hurt
you
will
have
killed
me
rest
assured
i
shall
come
to
no
serious
ill
i
hope
this
evening
to
laugh
with
you
at
your
alarms
and
so
long
as
you
do
not
see
me
either
in
the
flesh
or
in
the
spirit
you
may
know
that
i
am
safe
i
leave
you
for
ever
without
meeting
you
again
this
speech
which
i
should
have
ventured
in
no
other
presence
would
hardly
have
established
my
lunacy
more
decisively
in
martial
eyes
than
in
those
of
terrestrial
common
sense
it
conveyed
however
a
real
if
not
sufficient
consolation
to
eveena
the
idea
it
implied
being
not
wholly
unfamiliar
to
a
daughter
of
the
star
i
was
surprised
that
almost
shrinking
from
my
last
embrace
eveena
suddenly
dropped
her
veil
around
her
till
turning
i
saw
that
ergimo
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
leading
to
the
deck
and
just
in
sight
i
will
send
word
he
said
addressing
himself
to
me
but
speaking
for
her
ears
of
your
safety
at
noon
and
at
night
so
far
as
my
utmost
efforts
can
ensure
it
you
will
be
safe
an
obligation
higher
and
enforced
by
sanctions
graver
than
even
the
camptâ
command
forbids
me
to
lead
a
into
peril
and
fail
to
bring
him
out
of
it
the
significant
word
was
spoken
in
so
low
a
tone
that
it
could
not
possibly
reach
the
ears
of
our
companions
of
the
chase
who
had
mustered
on
shore
within
a
few
feet
of
the
vessel
but
eveena
evidently
caught
both
the
sound
and
the
meaning
and
i
was
glad
that
they
should
convey
to
her
a
confidence
which
seemed
to
myself
no
better
founded
than
her
alarms
to
me
its
only
value
lay
in
the
friendly
relation
it
established
with
one
i
had
begun
greatly
to
like
i
relied
on
my
own
strength
and
nerve
for
all
that
human
exertion
could
do
in
such
peril
as
we
might
encounter
and
in
a
case
in
which
these
might
fail
me
i
doubted
whether
even
the
one
tie
that
has
binding
force
on
mars
would
avail
me
much
immediately
outside
the
town
were
waiting
saddled
but
not
bridled
some
score
of
the
extraordinary
eveena
had
described
the
seat
of
the
rider
is
on
the
back
between
the
wings
but
the
saddle
consists
only
of
a
sort
of
girth
immediately
in
front
to
which
a
pair
of
stirrups
resembling
that
of
a
lady
were
attached
the
creature
that
was
to
carry
my
unusual
weight
was
the
most
powerful
of
all
but
i
felt
some
doubt
whether
even
his
strength
might
not
break
down
one
of
the
hunters
had
charge
of
a
carriage
on
which
was
fixed
a
cage
containing
two
dozen
birds
of
a
dark
greenish
grey
about
the
size
of
a
crow
and
with
the
slender
form
piercing
eyes
and
powerful
beak
of
the
falcon
they
were
not
intended
however
to
strike
the
prey
but
simply
to
do
the
part
of
dogs
in
tracing
out
the
game
and
driving
it
from
the
woods
into
the
open
ground
our
birds
rising
at
once
into
the
air
carried
us
some
fifty
feet
above
the
tops
of
the
trees
here
the
chief
huntsman
took
the
guidance
of
the
party
keeping
in
front
of
the
line
in
which
we
were
ranged
and
watching
through
a
pair
of
what
might
be
called
spectacles
save
that
a
very
short
tube
with
double
lenses
was
substituted
for
the
single
glass
the
movement
of
the
hawks
which
had
been
released
in
the
wood
below
us
these
at
first
dispersed
in
every
direction
extending
at
intervals
from
end
to
end
of
a
line
some
three
miles
in
length
and
moving
slowly
forwards
followed
by
the
hunters
a
sharp
call
from
one
bird
on
the
left
gathered
the
rest
around
him
and
in
a
few
moments
the
rustling
and
rushing
of
an
invisible
flock
through
the
glades
of
the
forest
apprised
us
that
we
had
started
though
we
could
not
see
the
prey
ergimo
who
kept
close
beside
me
and
who
had
often
witnessed
the
sport
before
kept
me
informed
of
what
was
proceeding
underneath
us
of
which
i
could
see
but
little
glimpses
here
and
there
showed
that
we
were
pursuing
a
numerous
flock
of
large
or
creatures
standing
at
most
some
four
feet
in
height
but
what
they
were
even
whether
birds
or
quadrupeds
their
movements
left
me
in
absolute
uncertainty
worried
and
frightened
by
the
falcons
which
however
never
ventured
to
close
upon
them
they
were
gradually
driven
in
the
direction
intended
by
the
huntsman
towards
the
open
plain
which
bordered
the
forest
at
a
distance
of
about
six
miles
to
the
northward
in
after
the
find
the
leader
of
the
flock
broke
out
of
the
wood
two
or
three
hundred
yards
ahead
of
us
and
was
closely
followed
by
his
companions
i
then
recognised
in
the
objects
of
the
chase
the
strange
described
by
eveena
whose
long
soft
down
furnished
the
cloak
she
wore
on
our
visit
to
the
astronaut
their
general
form
and
especially
the
length
and
graceful
curve
of
the
neck
led
one
instinctively
to
regard
them
as
birds
but
the
drawn
up
as
they
ran
but
now
and
then
outstretched
with
a
sweep
to
strike
at
a
falcon
that
ventured
imprudently
near
had
in
the
distance
much
more
resemblance
to
the
arm
of
a
baboon
than
to
the
limb
of
any
other
creature
and
bore
no
likeness
whatever
to
the
wing
even
of
the
bat
the
object
of
the
hunters
was
not
to
strike
these
creatures
from
a
distance
but
to
run
them
down
and
capture
them
by
sheer
exhaustion
this
the
great
of
the
enabled
us
to
do
though
by
the
time
we
had
driven
the
thernee
to
bay
my
own
pegasus
was
fairly
tired
the
hunters
separating
and
spreading
out
in
the
form
of
a
semicircle
assisted
the
movements
of
the
hawks
driving
the
prey
gradually
into
a
narrow
defile
among
the
hills
bordering
the
plain
to
the
whose
steep
upward
slope
greatly
hindered
and
fatigued
creatures
whose
natural
habitat
consists
of
level
plains
or
seabord
forests
at
last
under
a
steep
rock
which
defended
them
in
rear
and
between
clumps
of
trees
which
guarded
either
flank
protected
by
both
overhead
the
flock
at
the
call
of
their
leader
took
up
a
position
which
displayed
an
instinctive
strategy
whereof
an
indian
or
african
chief
might
have
been
proud
the
however
well
knew
the
vast
superiority
of
their
own
strength
and
of
their
formidable
beaks
and
did
not
hesitate
to
carry
us
close
to
but
somewhat
above
the
thernee
as
these
stood
ranged
in
line
with
extended
and
snouts
the
latter
armed
with
teeth
about
an
inch
and
a
half
in
length
tapering
singly
to
a
sharp
point
the
former
with
spikes
stronger
longer
and
sharper
than
those
of
the
porcupine
but
as
i
satisfied
myself
by
a
subsequent
inspection
formed
by
rudimentary
or
more
properly
speaking
transformed
or
degenerated
quills
the
bite
was
easily
avoided
it
was
not
so
easy
to
keep
out
of
reach
of
the
powerful
while
endeavouring
to
strike
a
fatal
blow
at
the
neck
with
the
long
cutting
weapons
carried
by
the
hunters
my
own
shorter
and
sharp
sword
to
which
i
had
trusted
preferring
a
familiar
weapon
to
one
however
suitable
to
which
i
was
not
accustomed
left
me
no
choice
but
to
abandon
the
hope
of
active
participation
in
the
slaughter
or
to
venture
dangerously
near
choosing
the
latter
alternative
i
received
from
the
arm
of
the
thernee
i
had
singled
out
a
blow
which
caught
upon
my
sword
very
nearly
smote
it
from
my
hand
and
certainly
would
have
disarmed
at
once
any
of
my
weaker
companions
as
it
was
the
stroke
maimed
the
limb
that
delivered
it
but
with
its
remaining
arm
the
creature
maintained
a
fight
so
stubborn
that
had
both
been
available
the
issue
could
not
have
been
in
my
favour
this
conflict
reminded
me
singularly
of
an
encounter
with
the
mounted
swordsmen
of
scindiah
and
the
peishwah
all
my
experience
of
being
called
into
use
and
my
brute
opponent
using
its
natural
weapon
with
an
instinctive
skill
not
unworthy
of
comparison
with
that
of
a
trained
at
the
same
time
that
it
constantly
endeavoured
to
seize
with
its
formidable
snout
either
my
own
arm
or
the
wing
or
body
of
the
caldecta
which
however
was
very
well
able
to
take
care
of
itself
in
fact
the
prey
was
secured
at
last
not
by
my
sword
but
by
a
blow
from
the
caldecta
beak
which
pierced
and
paralysed
the
slender
neck
of
our
antagonist
some
twenty
thernee
formed
the
booty
of
a
chase
certainly
novel
and
possessing
perhaps
as
many
elements
of
peril
and
excitement
as
that
finest
of
earthly
sports
which
the
affected
cynicism
of
speech
degrades
by
the
name
of
when
the
falcons
had
been
collected
and
recaged
and
the
bodies
of
the
thernee
consigned
to
a
carriage
brought
up
for
the
purpose
by
a
subordinate
who
had
watched
the
hunters
course
our
birds
from
which
we
had
dismounted
were
somewhat
rested
and
ergimo
informed
me
that
another
and
more
formidable
as
well
as
more
valuable
prey
was
thought
to
be
in
sight
a
few
miles
off
mounted
on
a
fresh
bird
and
resolutely
closing
my
ears
to
his
urgent
and
reasonable
dissuasion
i
joined
the
smaller
party
which
was
detached
for
this
purpose
as
we
were
carried
slowly
at
no
great
distance
from
the
ground
managing
our
birds
with
ease
by
a
touch
on
either
side
of
the
neck
they
are
spurred
at
need
by
a
slight
electric
shock
communicated
from
the
hilt
of
the
sword
and
are
checked
by
a
forcible
pressure
on
the
wings
i
asked
ergimo
why
the
thernee
were
not
rather
shot
than
hunted
since
utility
not
sport
governs
the
method
of
capturing
the
wild
beasts
of
mars
we
have
he
replied
two
weapons
adapted
to
strike
at
a
distance
the
asphyxiator
is
too
heavy
to
be
carried
far
or
fast
and
pieces
of
the
shell
inflict
such
injuries
upon
everything
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
explosion
as
to
render
it
useless
where
the
value
of
the
prey
depends
upon
the
condition
of
its
skin
our
other
and
much
more
convenient
if
less
powerful
projective
weapon
has
also
its
own
disadvantage
it
can
be
used
only
at
short
distances
and
at
these
it
is
apt
to
burn
and
tear
a
skin
so
soft
and
delicate
as
that
of
the
thernee
moreover
it
so
terrifies
the
caldecta
as
to
render
it
unmanageable
and
we
are
compelled
to
dismount
before
using
it
as
you
may
presently
see
four
or
five
of
our
party
are
now
armed
with
it
and
i
wish
you
had
allowed
me
to
furnish
you
with
one
i
prefer
i
answered
my
own
weapon
an
which
i
can
fire
sixteen
times
without
reloading
and
which
will
kill
at
a
hundred
yards
distance
with
a
weapon
unknown
to
me
i
might
not
only
fail
altogether
but
i
might
not
improbably
do
serious
injury
by
my
clumsiness
and
inexperience
to
my
companions
i
wish
nevertheless
he
said
that
you
carried
the
you
will
have
need
of
an
efficient
weapon
if
you
dismount
to
share
the
attack
we
are
just
about
to
make
but
i
entreat
you
not
to
do
so
you
can
see
it
all
in
perfect
safety
if
only
you
will
keep
far
enough
away
to
avoid
danger
from
the
fright
of
your
bird
as
he
spoke
we
had
come
into
proximity
to
our
new
game
a
large
and
very
powerful
animal
about
four
feet
high
at
the
shoulders
and
about
six
feet
from
the
head
to
the
root
of
the
tail
the
latter
carries
as
that
of
the
lion
was
fabled
to
do
a
final
claw
not
to
lash
the
creature
into
rage
but
for
the
more
practical
purpose
of
striking
down
an
enemy
endeavouring
to
approach
it
in
flank
or
rear
its
hide
covered
with
a
long
beautifully
soft
fur
is
striped
alternately
with
brown
and
yellow
the
ground
being
a
sort
of
the
head
resembles
that
of
the
lion
but
without
the
mane
and
is
prolonged
into
a
face
and
snout
more
like
those
of
the
wild
boar
its
limbs
are
less
unlike
those
of
the
feline
genus
than
any
other
earthly
type
but
have
three
claws
and
a
hard
pad
in
lieu
of
the
soft
cushion
the
upper
jaw
is
armed
with
two
formidable
tusks
about
twelve
inches
in
length
and
projecting
directly
forwards
a
blow
from
the
tail
would
plough
up
the
thigh
or
rip
open
the
abdomen
of
a
man
a
stroke
from
one
of
the
paws
would
fracture
his
skull
while
a
wound
from
the
tusk
in
almost
any
part
of
the
body
must
prove
certainly
fatal
fortunately
the
has
not
the
swiftness
of
movement
belonging
to
nearly
all
our
feline
races
otherwise
its
skins
the
most
valuable
prize
of
the
martial
hunter
would
yearly
be
taken
at
a
terrible
cost
of
life
two
of
these
creatures
were
said
to
be
reposing
in
a
thick
jungle
of
reeds
bordering
a
narrow
stream
immediately
in
our
front
the
hunters
with
ergimo
now
dismounted
and
advanced
some
two
hundred
yards
in
front
of
their
birds
directing
the
latter
to
turn
their
heads
in
the
opposite
direction
i
found
some
difficulty
in
making
my
wish
to
descend
intelligible
to
the
docile
creature
which
carried
me
and
was
still
in
the
air
when
one
of
the
enormous
creatures
we
were
hunting
rushed
out
of
its
the
nearest
hunter
raising
a
shining
metal
staff
about
three
and
a
half
feet
in
length
having
a
crystal
cylinder
at
the
hinder
end
about
six
inches
in
circumference
and
occupying
about
the
entire
length
of
the
weapon
levelled
it
at
the
beast
a
flash
as
of
lightning
darted
through
the
air
and
the
creature
rolled
over
another
flash
from
a
similar
weapon
in
the
hands
of
another
hunter
followed
by
this
time
however
my
bird
was
entirely
unmanageable
and
what
happened
i
learned
afterwards
from
ergimo
neither
of
the
two
shots
had
wounded
the
creature
though
the
near
passage
of
the
first
had
for
a
moment
stunned
and
overthrown
him
his
rush
among
the
party
dispersed
them
all
but
each
being
able
to
send
forth
from
his
piece
a
second
flash
of
lightning
the
monster
was
mortally
wounded
before
they
fairly
started
in
pursuit
of
their
scared
birds
which
their
attention
being
called
by
the
roar
of
the
animal
by
the
crash
accompanying
each
flash
and
probably
above
all
by
the
restlessness
of
my
own
in
their
midst
had
flown
off
to
some
distance
my
bird
floundering
forwards
flung
me
to
the
ground
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
jungle
fortunately
at
a
greater
distance
from
the
dying
but
not
yet
utterly
disabled
prey
its
companion
now
came
forth
and
stood
over
the
tortured
creature
licking
its
sores
till
it
expired
by
this
time
i
had
recovered
the
consciousness
i
had
lost
with
the
shock
of
my
fall
and
had
ascertained
that
my
gun
was
safe
i
had
but
time
to
prepare
and
level
it
when
leaving
its
dead
companion
the
brute
turned
and
charged
me
almost
as
rapidly
as
an
infuriated
elephant
i
fired
several
times
and
assured
if
only
from
my
skill
as
a
marksman
that
some
of
the
shots
had
hit
it
was
surprised
to
see
that
at
each
it
was
only
checked
for
a
moment
and
then
resumed
its
charge
it
was
so
near
now
that
i
could
aim
with
some
confidence
at
the
eye
and
if
as
i
suspected
the
previous
shots
had
failed
to
pierce
the
hide
no
other
aim
was
likely
to
avail
i
levelled
therefore
as
steadily
as
i
could
at
its
blazing
eyeballs
and
fired
three
or
four
shots
still
without
doing
more
than
arrest
or
rather
slacken
its
charge
each
shot
provoking
a
fearful
roar
of
rage
and
pain
i
fired
my
last
within
about
twenty
yards
and
then
before
i
could
draw
my
sword
was
dashed
to
the
ground
with
a
violence
that
utterly
stunned
me
when
i
recovered
my
senses
ergimo
was
kneeling
beside
me
pouring
down
my
throat
the
contents
of
a
small
phial
and
as
i
lifted
my
head
and
looked
around
i
saw
the
enormous
carcass
from
under
which
i
had
been
dragged
lying
dead
almost
within
reach
of
my
hand
one
eye
was
pierced
through
the
very
centre
the
other
seriously
injured
but
such
is
the
creature
tenacity
of
life
that
though
three
balls
were
actually
in
its
brain
it
had
driven
home
its
charge
though
far
too
unconscious
to
make
more
than
convulsive
and
feeble
use
of
any
of
its
formidable
weapons
when
i
fell
it
stood
for
perhaps
a
second
and
then
dropped
senseless
upon
my
lower
limbs
which
were
not
a
little
bruised
by
its
weight
that
no
bone
was
broken
or
dislocated
by
the
shock
deadened
though
it
must
have
been
by
the
repeated
pauses
in
the
charge
and
by
its
final
exhaustion
was
more
than
i
expected
or
could
understand
before
i
rose
to
my
feet
ergimo
had
peremptorily
insisted
on
the
abandonment
of
the
further
excursion
we
had
intended
declaring
that
he
could
not
answer
to
his
sovereign
after
so
severe
a
lesson
for
my
exposure
to
any
future
peril
the
camptâ
had
sent
him
to
bring
me
into
his
presence
for
purposes
which
would
not
be
fulfilled
by
producing
a
lifeless
carcass
or
a
maimed
and
helpless
invalid
and
the
discipline
of
the
court
and
central
administration
allowed
no
excuse
for
disobedience
to
orders
or
failure
in
duty
my
protest
was
very
quickly
silenced
on
attempting
to
stand
i
found
myself
so
shaken
torn
and
shattered
that
i
could
not
again
mount
a
or
wield
a
weapon
and
was
carried
back
to
askinta
on
a
sort
of
inclined
litter
placed
upon
the
carriage
which
had
conveyed
our
booty
i
was
mortified
as
we
approached
the
place
where
our
vessel
lay
to
observe
a
veiled
female
figure
on
the
deck
eveena
quick
eye
had
noted
our
return
some
minutes
before
and
inferred
from
the
early
abandonment
of
the
chase
some
serious
accident
happily
our
party
were
so
disposed
that
i
had
time
to
assume
the
usual
position
before
she
caught
sight
of
me
i
could
not
however
deceive
her
by
a
desperate
effort
to
walk
steadily
and
unaided
she
stood
by
quietly
and
calmly
while
the
surgeon
of
the
hunters
dressed
my
hurts
observing
exactly
how
the
bandages
and
lotions
were
applied
only
when
we
were
left
alone
did
she
in
any
degree
give
way
to
an
agitation
by
which
she
feared
to
increase
my
evident
pain
and
feverishness
it
was
impossible
to
satisfy
her
that
black
bruises
and
broad
gashes
meant
no
danger
and
would
be
healed
by
a
few
days
rest
but
when
she
saw
that
i
could
talk
and
smile
as
usual
she
was
unsparing
in
her
attempts
to
coax
from
me
a
pledge
that
i
would
never
again
peril
life
or
limb
to
gratify
my
curiosity
regarding
the
very
few
pursuits
in
which
for
the
highest
remuneration
martialists
can
be
induced
to
incur
the
probability
of
injury
and
the
chance
of
that
death
they
so
abjectly
dread
scarcely
less
reluctant
to
repeat
the
scolding
she
felt
so
acutely
than
to
employ
the
methods
of
rebuke
she
deemed
less
severe
i
had
no
little
difficulty
in
evading
her
entreaties
only
a
very
decided
request
to
drop
the
subject
at
once
and
for
ever
enforced
on
her
conscience
by
reminding
her
that
it
would
be
enforced
no
otherwise
at
last
obtained
me
peace
without
the
sacrifice
of
liberty
chapter
xvi
troubled
waters
we
were
now
in
martial
latitude
in
a
comparatively
open
part
of
the
narrow
sea
which
encloses
the
northern
and
to
the
lay
the
only
channel
by
which
this
sea
communicates
with
the
main
ocean
of
the
southern
hemisphere
along
this
we
took
our
course
rather
against
ergimo
advice
i
insisted
on
remaining
on
the
surface
as
the
sea
was
tolerably
calm
eveena
with
her
usual
professed
to
prefer
the
free
air
the
light
of
the
long
day
and
such
amusement
as
the
sight
of
an
occasional
or
shoal
of
fishes
afforded
to
the
fainter
light
and
comparative
monotony
of
submarine
travelling
ergimo
who
had
in
his
time
commanded
the
hunters
of
the
arctic
sea
was
almost
as
completely
exempt
as
myself
from
but
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
crew
disliked
and
had
they
ventured
would
have
grumbled
at
the
change
being
so
little
accustomed
to
any
long
superficial
voyage
as
to
suffer
like
landsmen
from
rough
weather
the
difference
between
sailing
on
and
below
the
surface
is
so
great
both
in
comfort
and
in
the
kind
of
skill
and
knowledge
required
that
the
seamen
of
passenger
and
of
mercantile
vessels
are
classes
much
more
distinct
than
those
of
the
mercantile
and
national
marine
of
england
or
any
other
maritime
power
on
earth
i
consented
readily
that
except
on
the
rare
occasions
when
the
heavens
were
visible
the
short
night
from
the
fall
of
the
evening
to
the
dissipation
of
the
morning
mists
should
be
passed
under
water
i
have
said
that
gales
are
comparatively
rare
and
the
tides
insignificant
but
the
narrow
and
exceedingly
long
channels
of
the
martial
seas
with
the
influence
of
a
solar
movement
from
north
to
south
more
extensive
though
slower
than
that
which
takes
place
between
our
winter
and
summer
solstices
produce
currents
atmospheric
and
oceanic
and
sudden
squalls
that
often
give
rise
to
that
worst
of
all
disturbances
of
the
surface
known
as
a
chopping
sea
when
we
crossed
the
tropic
and
came
fairly
into
the
channel
separating
the
western
coast
of
the
continent
on
which
the
astronaut
had
landed
from
the
eastern
seabord
of
that
upon
whose
southern
coast
i
was
presently
to
disembark
this
disturbance
was
even
worse
than
except
on
peculiarly
disagreeable
occasions
in
the
straits
of
dover
after
enduring
this
for
two
or
three
hours
i
observed
that
eveena
had
stolen
from
her
seat
beside
me
on
the
deck
since
we
left
askinta
her
spirits
had
been
unusually
variable
she
had
been
sometimes
lively
and
almost
excitable
more
generally
quiet
depressed
and
silent
even
beyond
her
wont
still
her
manner
and
bearing
were
always
so
equable
gentle
and
docile
that
accustomed
to
the
caprices
of
the
sex
on
earth
i
had
hardly
noticed
the
change
i
thought
however
that
she
was
nervous
and
somewhat
pale
and
as
she
did
not
return
after
permitting
the
pilot
to
seek
a
calmer
stratum
at
some
five
fathoms
depth
i
followed
eveena
into
our
cabin
or
chamber
standing
with
her
back
to
the
entrance
and
with
a
goblet
to
her
lips
she
did
not
hear
me
till
i
had
approached
within
arm
length
she
then
started
violently
so
agitated
that
the
colour
faded
at
once
from
her
countenance
leaving
it
white
as
in
a
swoon
then
as
suddenly
returning
flushed
her
neck
and
face
from
the
emerald
shoulder
clasps
to
the
silver
snood
with
a
pink
deeper
than
that
of
her
robe
i
am
very
sorry
i
startled
you
i
said
you
are
certainly
ill
or
you
would
not
be
so
easily
upset
i
laid
my
hand
as
i
spoke
on
her
soft
tresses
but
she
withdrew
from
the
touch
sinking
down
among
the
cushions
leaving
her
to
recover
her
composure
i
took
up
the
cup
she
had
dropped
on
the
central
table
thirsty
myself
i
had
almost
drained
without
tasting
it
when
a
little
cry
of
dismay
checked
me
the
moment
i
removed
the
cup
from
my
mouth
i
perceived
its
flavour
the
unmistakable
taste
of
the
courage
cup
so
disagreeable
to
us
both
which
we
had
shared
on
our
bridal
evening
wetting
with
one
drop
the
attached
to
my
it
presented
the
local
discoloration
indicating
the
narcotic
poison
which
is
the
chief
ingredient
of
this
compound
i
do
think
this
is
wise
child
i
said
turning
once
more
to
eveena
to
my
amazement
far
from
having
recovered
the
effect
of
her
surprise
she
was
yet
more
overcome
than
at
first
crouching
among
the
cushions
with
her
head
bent
down
over
her
knees
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
reclining
in
the
soft
pile
i
held
her
in
my
arms
overcoming
perforce
what
seemed
hysterical
reluctance
but
when
i
would
have
withdrawn
the
little
hands
she
threw
herself
on
my
knee
burying
her
face
in
the
cushions
it
is
very
wicked
she
sobbed
i
can
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
forgive
what
my
child
eveena
you
are
certainly
ill
calm
yourself
and
do
try
to
talk
just
now
i
am
not
ill
i
assure
you
she
faltered
resisting
the
arm
that
sought
to
raise
her
but
in
my
hands
however
she
was
powerless
as
an
infant
and
i
would
hear
nothing
till
i
held
her
gathered
within
my
arm
and
her
two
hands
fast
in
my
right
now
that
i
could
look
into
the
face
she
strove
to
avert
it
was
clear
that
she
was
neither
hysterical
nor
simply
ill
her
agitation
however
unreasonable
and
extravagant
was
real
what
troubles
you
my
own
i
promise
you
not
to
say
one
word
of
reproach
i
only
want
to
understand
with
what
you
so
bitterly
reproach
yourself
but
you
can
not
help
being
angry
she
urged
if
you
understand
what
i
have
done
it
is
the
which
i
never
tasted
till
that
night
and
never
ought
to
have
tasted
again
i
know
you
can
not
forgive
me
only
take
my
fault
for
granted
and
do
question
me
these
incoherent
words
threw
the
first
glimpse
of
light
on
the
meaning
of
her
distress
and
penitence
i
doubt
if
the
best
woman
in
christendom
would
so
reproach
and
abase
herself
if
convicted
of
even
a
worse
sin
than
the
secret
use
of
those
stimulants
for
which
the
is
a
martial
equivalent
no
martialist
would
dream
of
poisoning
his
blood
and
besotting
his
brain
with
alcohol
in
any
form
but
their
opiates
affect
a
race
addicted
to
physical
repose
to
sensuous
enjoyment
rather
than
to
sensual
excitement
and
to
lucid
intellectual
contemplation
with
a
sense
of
serene
delight
as
supremely
delicious
to
their
temperament
as
the
dreamy
illusions
of
haschisch
to
the
turk
the
fierce
frenzy
of
bhang
to
the
malay
or
the
wild
excitement
of
brandy
or
geneva
to
the
races
of
northern
europe
but
as
with
the
luxury
of
intoxication
in
europe
so
in
mars
indulgence
in
these
drugs
freely
permitted
to
the
one
sex
is
strictly
forbidden
by
opinion
and
domestic
rule
to
the
other
a
lady
discovered
in
the
use
of
is
as
deeply
disgraced
as
an
european
matron
detected
in
the
secret
enjoyment
of
spirits
and
cigars
and
her
lord
and
master
takes
care
to
render
her
sufficiently
conscious
of
her
fault
and
there
was
something
stranger
here
than
a
violation
of
the
artificial
restraint
of
sex
slightly
and
seldom
as
the
golden
circle
touches
the
lines
defining
personal
or
social
morality
carefully
as
the
founder
has
abstained
from
imposing
an
ethical
code
of
his
own
or
attaching
to
his
precepts
any
rule
not
directly
derived
from
the
fundamental
tenets
or
necessary
to
the
cohesion
of
the
order
he
had
expressed
in
strong
terms
his
dread
and
horror
of
narcotism
the
use
for
pleasure
sake
not
to
relieve
pain
or
nervous
excitement
of
drugs
which
act
as
he
said
through
the
brain
upon
the
soul
his
judgment
expressed
with
unusual
directness
and
severity
and
enforced
by
experience
has
become
with
his
followers
a
tradition
not
less
imperative
than
the
most
binding
of
their
laws
it
was
so
held
above
all
in
that
household
in
which
eveena
and
i
had
first
learnt
the
lore
of
the
starlight
esmo
indeed
regarded
not
merely
as
an
unscientific
superstition
but
as
blasphemous
folly
the
rejection
of
any
means
of
restoring
health
or
relieving
pain
which
providence
has
placed
within
human
reach
but
he
abhorred
the
use
for
pleasure
sake
of
poisons
affirmed
to
reduce
the
activity
and
in
the
to
impair
the
energies
of
the
mind
and
weaken
the
moral
sense
and
the
will
more
intensely
than
the
strictest
follower
of
the
arabian
prophet
abhors
the
draughts
which
deprive
man
of
the
full
use
of
the
senses
intelligence
and
conscience
which
allah
has
bestowed
and
degrade
him
below
the
brute
esmo
children
moreover
were
not
more
strictly
compelled
to
respect
the
letter
than
carefully
instructed
in
the
principle
of
every
command
for
which
he
claimed
their
obedience
but
in
such
measure
as
eveena
distress
became
intelligible
the
fault
of
which
she
accused
herself
became
incredible
i
could
not
believe
that
she
could
be
wilfully
disloyal
to
me
still
less
that
she
could
have
suddenly
broken
through
the
fixed
ideas
of
her
whole
life
the
principles
engraved
on
her
mind
by
education
more
stringently
than
the
maxims
of
the
koran
or
the
levitical
law
on
the
children
of
ishmael
or
of
israel
and
this
while
the
impressive
rites
of
initiation
the
imprecation
at
which
i
myself
had
shuddered
were
fresh
in
her
memory
their
impression
infinitely
deepened
moreover
by
the
awful
mystery
of
that
vision
of
which
even
yet
we
were
half
afraid
to
speak
to
one
another
while
i
hesitated
to
reply
gathering
up
as
well
as
i
could
the
thread
of
these
thoughts
as
they
passed
in
a
few
seconds
through
my
mind
my
left
hand
touched
an
object
hidden
in
my
bride
zone
i
drew
out
a
tiny
crystal
phial
three
parts
full
taken
as
i
saw
from
the
esmo
had
carefully
stocked
and
as
carefully
fastened
as
holding
this
i
turned
again
to
her
eveena
repeated
punish
but
do
question
me
my
own
i
said
you
are
far
more
punished
already
than
you
deserve
or
i
can
bear
to
see
how
did
you
get
this
releasing
her
hands
she
drew
from
the
folds
of
her
robe
the
electric
keys
which
by
a
separate
combination
would
unlock
each
of
my
cases
without
which
it
was
impossible
to
open
or
force
them
yes
i
remember
and
you
were
surprised
that
i
trusted
them
to
you
and
now
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
have
abused
that
trust
deceived
me
broken
a
rule
which
in
your
father
house
and
by
all
our
order
is
held
sacred
as
the
rings
of
the
signet
for
a
drug
which
twelve
days
ago
you
disliked
as
much
as
i
it
is
true
the
words
were
spoken
with
downcast
eyes
in
the
low
faltering
tone
natural
to
a
confession
of
disgrace
it
is
not
true
eveena
or
if
true
in
form
false
in
matter
if
it
were
possible
that
you
could
wish
to
deceive
me
you
knew
it
could
not
be
for
long
i
meant
to
be
found
out
she
interrupted
only
not
yet
she
had
betrayed
herself
stung
by
words
that
seemed
to
express
the
one
doubt
she
could
not
nerve
herself
to
endure
doubt
of
her
loyalty
to
me
before
i
could
speak
she
looked
up
hastily
and
began
to
retract
i
stopped
her
i
see
when
you
had
done
with
it
but
eveena
why
conceal
it
do
you
think
i
would
not
have
given
this
or
all
the
contents
of
the
chest
into
your
hands
and
asked
no
question
do
you
mean
it
could
you
have
so
trusted
me
my
child
is
it
difficult
to
trust
where
i
know
there
is
no
temptation
to
wrong
do
you
think
that
i
have
doubted
or
suspected
you
even
while
you
have
accused
yourself
i
can
not
guess
at
your
motive
but
i
am
as
sure
as
ever
of
your
loyalty
take
these
things
forcing
back
upon
her
the
phial
and
the
magnets
yes
and
the
she
burst
into
passionate
tears
i
can
not
endure
this
if
i
had
dreamed
your
patience
would
have
borne
with
me
half
so
far
i
would
never
have
tried
it
so
even
for
your
own
sake
i
meant
to
be
found
out
and
accept
the
consequences
in
silence
but
you
trust
me
so
that
i
must
tell
you
what
i
wanted
to
conceal
when
you
kept
on
the
surface
it
made
me
so
ill
but
eveena
if
the
remedy
be
not
worse
than
the
sickness
why
not
ask
for
it
openly
it
was
not
that
do
you
understand
of
course
i
would
bear
any
suffering
rather
than
have
done
this
but
then
you
would
have
found
me
out
at
once
i
wanted
to
conceal
my
suffering
not
to
escape
it
my
child
my
child
how
could
you
put
us
both
to
all
this
pain
you
know
you
would
not
have
given
me
the
draught
you
would
have
left
the
surface
at
once
and
i
can
not
bear
to
be
always
in
the
way
always
hindering
your
pleasures
and
even
your
discoveries
you
came
across
a
distance
that
makes
a
bigger
world
than
this
look
less
than
that
light
through
solitude
and
dangers
and
horrors
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
to
see
and
examine
this
world
of
ours
and
then
you
leave
things
unseen
or
you
spoil
your
work
because
a
girl
is
seasick
you
ran
great
risk
of
death
and
got
badly
hurt
to
see
what
our
hunting
was
like
and
you
will
not
let
my
head
ache
that
you
may
find
out
what
our
and
currents
are
how
can
i
bear
to
be
such
a
burden
upon
you
you
trust
me
and
i
believe
she
added
colouring
you
love
me
twelvefold
more
than
i
deserve
yet
you
think
me
unwilling
or
unworthy
to
take
ever
so
small
an
interest
in
your
work
to
bear
a
few
hours
discomfort
for
it
and
for
you
and
yet
she
went
on
passionately
i
may
sit
trembling
and
for
a
whole
day
alone
that
you
may
carry
out
your
purpose
i
may
receive
the
only
real
sting
your
lips
have
given
because
i
could
not
bear
that
pain
without
crying
and
so
with
everything
it
is
not
that
i
must
not
suffer
pain
but
that
the
pain
must
not
come
from
without
your
lips
would
punish
a
fault
with
words
that
shame
and
sting
for
a
day
a
summer
a
year
your
hand
must
never
inflict
a
sting
that
may
smart
for
ten
minutes
and
it
is
not
only
that
you
do
this
but
you
pride
yourself
on
it
why
it
is
not
that
you
think
the
pain
of
the
body
so
much
worse
than
that
of
the
spirit
you
that
smiled
at
me
when
you
were
too
badly
bruised
and
torn
to
stand
yet
could
scarcely
keep
back
your
tears
just
now
when
you
thought
that
i
had
suffered
half
an
hour
of
sorrow
i
did
not
quite
deserve
why
then
do
you
think
that
women
feel
so
differently
have
the
women
of
your
earth
hearts
so
much
harder
and
skins
so
much
softer
than
ours
she
spoke
with
most
unusual
impetuosity
and
with
that
absolute
simplicity
and
sincerity
which
marked
her
every
look
and
word
which
gave
them
for
me
at
least
an
unspeakable
charm
and
for
all
who
heard
her
a
characteristic
individuality
unlike
the
speech
or
manner
of
any
other
woman
as
soon
suspect
an
infant
of
elaborate
sarcasm
as
eveena
of
affectation
irony
or
conscious
paradox
nay
while
her
voice
was
in
my
ears
i
never
could
feel
that
her
views
paradoxical
the
direct
straightforwardness
and
simple
structure
of
the
martial
language
enhanced
this
peculiar
effect
of
her
speech
and
much
that
seems
infantine
in
translation
was
all
but
eloquent
as
she
spoke
it
often
as
on
this
occasion
i
felt
guilty
of
insincerity
of
a
verbal
fencing
unworthy
of
her
unalloyed
good
faith
and
earnestness
as
i
endeavoured
to
parry
thrusts
that
went
to
the
very
heart
of
all
those
instinctive
doctrines
which
i
could
the
less
defend
on
the
moment
because
i
had
never
before
dreamed
that
they
could
be
doubted
at
any
rate
i
said
at
last
your
sex
gain
by
my
heresy
since
they
are
as
richly
gifted
in
stinging
words
as
we
in
physical
force
so
much
the
worse
for
them
surely
she
answered
simply
if
it
be
right
that
men
should
rule
and
women
obey
that
is
the
received
doctrine
on
earth
i
answered
in
practice
men
command
and
women
disobey
them
men
bully
and
women
lie
but
in
truth
eveena
having
a
wife
only
too
loyal
and
too
loving
i
care
to
canvass
the
deserts
of
ordinary
women
or
the
discipline
of
other
households
i
own
that
it
was
wrong
to
scold
you
do
not
insist
on
making
me
say
that
it
would
have
been
a
little
less
wrong
to
beat
you
she
laughed
her
low
sweet
silvery
laugh
the
like
of
which
i
have
hardly
heard
among
earthly
women
even
of
the
simpler
more
races
of
the
east
and
south
a
laugh
still
stranger
in
a
world
where
childhood
is
seldom
bright
and
womanhood
mostly
sad
and
fretful
of
the
very
few
satisfactory
memories
i
bore
away
from
that
world
the
sweetest
is
the
recollection
of
that
laugh
which
i
heard
for
the
first
time
on
the
morrow
of
our
bridals
and
for
the
last
time
on
the
day
before
we
parted
i
cherish
it
as
evidence
that
despite
many
and
bitter
troubles
my
bride
short
married
life
was
not
wholly
unhappy
by
this
time
she
had
found
out
that
we
had
left
the
surface
and
began
to
remonstrate
nay
i
have
seen
all
i
care
to
see
my
own
i
confess
the
justice
of
your
claim
as
the
partner
of
my
life
to
be
the
partner
of
its
paramount
purpose
you
are
more
precious
to
me
than
all
the
discoveries
of
which
i
ever
dreamed
and
i
will
not
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
expose
you
to
real
peril
or
serious
pain
but
henceforth
i
will
ask
you
to
bear
discomfort
and
inconvenience
when
the
object
is
worth
it
and
to
help
me
wherever
your
help
can
avail
i
can
help
you
much
and
in
many
ways
my
eveena
you
will
soon
learn
to
understand
what
i
wish
to
examine
and
the
use
of
the
instruments
i
employ
and
then
you
will
be
the
most
useful
of
assistants
as
you
are
the
best
and
most
welcome
of
companions
as
i
spoke
a
soft
colour
suffused
her
face
and
her
eyes
brightened
with
a
joy
and
contentment
such
as
no
promise
of
pleasure
or
indulgence
could
have
inspired
to
be
the
partner
of
adventure
and
hardship
the
drudge
in
toil
and
sentinel
in
peril
was
the
boon
she
claimed
the
best
guerdon
i
could
promise
if
but
the
promise
might
have
been
better
fulfilled
it
was
not
till
in
latitude
we
emerged
into
the
open
ocean
and
presently
found
ourselves
free
from
the
currents
of
the
narrow
waters
that
in
order
to
see
the
remarkable
island
of
which
i
had
caught
sight
in
my
descent
i
requested
ergimo
to
remain
for
some
hours
above
the
surface
the
island
rises
directly
out
of
the
sea
and
is
absolutely
unascendible
balloons
however
render
access
possible
both
to
its
summit
and
to
its
sides
it
is
the
home
of
enormous
flocks
of
white
birds
which
resemble
in
form
the
heron
rather
than
the
eider
duck
but
which
like
the
latter
line
with
down
drawn
from
their
own
breasts
the
nests
which
counted
by
millions
occupy
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
crystalline
walls
about
ten
miles
in
circumference
each
of
the
nests
is
nearly
as
large
as
that
of
the
stork
they
are
made
of
a
jelly
digested
from
the
bones
of
the
fish
upon
which
the
birds
prey
and
are
almost
as
white
in
colour
as
the
birds
themselves
freshly
formed
nest
dissolved
in
hot
water
makes
dishes
as
much
to
the
taste
of
martialists
as
the
famous
soup
to
that
of
the
chinese
both
down
and
nests
therefore
are
largely
plundered
but
the
birds
are
never
injured
and
care
is
taken
in
robbing
them
to
leave
enough
of
the
outer
portion
of
the
nest
to
constitute
a
bed
for
the
eggs
and
encourage
the
creatures
to
rebuild
and
reline
it
one
harvest
only
is
permitted
the
second
stripping
of
feathers
and
the
rebuilt
nest
being
left
undisturbed
the
caverns
are
lined
with
a
white
guano
now
some
feet
thick
since
it
has
ceased
to
be
sought
for
manure
the
martialists
having
discovered
means
of
saturating
the
soil
with
ammonia
procured
from
the
nitrogen
of
the
atmosphere
which
with
the
sewage
and
other
similar
materials
enables
them
to
dispense
with
this
valuable
bird
manure
whether
the
white
colour
of
the
island
perceptible
even
in
a
large
terrestrial
telescope
is
in
any
degree
due
to
the
whiteness
of
the
birds
their
nests
and
leavings
or
wholly
to
reflection
from
the
bright
surface
of
the
rock
itself
and
especially
of
the
flat
summit
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
from
this
point
we
held
our
course
and
entered
the
northernmost
of
two
extraordinary
gulfs
of
exactly
similar
shape
separated
by
an
isthmus
and
peninsula
which
assume
on
a
map
the
form
of
a
gigantic
hammer
the
strait
by
which
each
gulf
is
entered
is
about
a
hundred
miles
in
length
and
ten
in
breadth
the
gulf
itself
if
it
should
not
rather
be
called
an
inland
sea
occupies
a
total
area
of
about
square
miles
the
isthmus
miles
in
length
by
in
breadth
ends
in
a
roughly
square
peninsula
of
about
square
miles
in
extent
nearly
the
whole
of
which
is
a
plateau
feet
above
the
on
the
narrowest
point
of
the
isthmus
just
where
it
joins
the
mainland
and
where
a
sheltered
bay
runs
up
from
either
sea
is
situated
the
great
city
of
amâkasfe
the
natural
centre
of
martial
life
and
commerce
at
this
point
we
found
awaiting
us
the
balloon
which
was
to
convey
us
to
the
court
of
the
suzerain
a
very
light
but
strong
metallic
framework
maintained
the
form
of
the
or
balloon
itself
which
closely
resembled
that
of
our
vessel
its
dimensions
being
of
necessity
greater
attached
to
this
framework
was
the
car
of
similar
form
about
twelve
feet
in
length
and
six
in
depth
the
upper
third
of
the
sides
however
being
of
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
survey
of
the
traveller
eveena
could
not
help
shivering
at
the
sight
of
the
slight
vehicle
and
the
enormous
machine
of
thin
material
by
which
it
was
to
be
upheld
she
embarked
indeed
without
a
word
her
alarm
betraying
itself
by
no
voluntary
sign
unless
it
were
the
tight
clasp
of
my
hand
resembling
that
of
a
child
frightened
but
ashamed
to
confess
its
fear
i
noticed
however
that
she
so
arranged
her
veil
as
to
cover
her
eyes
when
the
signal
for
the
start
was
given
she
was
therefore
wholly
unconscious
of
the
sudden
spring
unattended
by
the
slightest
jolt
or
shake
which
raised
us
at
once
feet
above
the
coast
and
under
whose
influence
to
my
eyes
the
ground
appeared
suddenly
to
fall
from
us
when
i
drew
out
the
folds
of
her
veil
it
was
with
no
little
amazement
that
she
saw
the
sky
around
her
the
sea
and
the
city
far
below
an
aerial
current
to
the
at
our
present
level
which
had
been
selected
on
that
account
carried
us
at
a
rate
of
some
twelve
miles
an
hour
a
rate
much
increased
however
by
the
sails
at
the
stern
of
the
car
sails
of
thin
metal
fixed
on
strong
frames
and
striking
with
a
motion
their
lack
of
expanse
was
compensated
by
a
rapidity
of
motion
such
that
they
seemed
to
the
eye
not
to
move
at
all
presenting
the
appearance
of
an
uniform
disc
reflecting
the
rays
of
the
sun
which
was
now
almost
immediately
above
us
towards
evening
the
residence
of
the
camptâ
became
visible
on
the
horizon
it
was
built
on
a
plateau
about
feet
above
the
towards
which
the
ground
from
all
sides
sloped
up
almost
imperceptibly
around
it
was
a
garden
of
great
extent
with
a
number
of
trees
of
every
sort
some
of
them
masses
of
the
darkest
green
others
of
bright
yellow
contrasting
similarly
shaped
masses
of
almost
equal
size
clothed
from
base
to
top
in
a
continuous
sheet
of
pink
emerald
white
or
crimson
flowers
the
turf
presented
almost
as
great
a
variety
of
colours
arranged
in
every
conceivable
pattern
above
which
rose
innumerable
uniform
or
varied
the
smallest
perhaps
two
the
largest
more
than
feet
in
diameter
each
circle
of
bloom
higher
than
that
outside
it
till
in
some
cases
the
centre
rose
even
ten
feet
above
the
general
level
the
building
itself
was
low
having
nowhere
more
than
two
stories
one
wing
pointed
out
to
me
by
ergimo
was
appropriated
to
the
household
of
the
prince
the
centre
standing
out
in
front
and
rear
divided
by
a
court
almost
as
wide
as
the
wings
the
further
wing
accommodating
the
attendants
and
officials
of
the
court
we
landed
just
before
the
evening
mist
began
to
gather
at
the
foot
of
an
inclined
way
of
a
concrete
resembling
jasper
leading
up
to
the
main
entrance
of
the
palace
chapter
xvii
presented
at
court
leading
eveena
by
the
hand
for
to
hold
my
arm
after
the
european
fashion
was
always
an
inconvenience
and
fatigue
to
her
and
preceded
by
ergimo
i
walked
unnoticed
to
the
closed
gate
of
pink
crystal
contrasting
the
emerald
green
of
the
outer
walls
along
the
front
of
this
central
portion
of
the
residence
was
a
species
of
verandah
supported
by
pillars
overlaid
with
a
bright
red
metal
and
wrought
in
the
form
of
smooth
tree
trunks
closely
clasped
by
creepers
the
silver
flowers
of
the
latter
contrasting
the
dense
golden
foliage
and
stems
under
this
and
in
front
of
the
gate
itself
were
two
sentries
armed
with
a
spear
the
shaft
of
which
was
about
six
feet
in
length
hollow
and
almost
as
light
as
the
cane
or
reed
handle
of
an
african
assegai
the
blade
more
resembled
the
triangular
bayonet
beside
each
however
was
the
terrible
asphyxiator
fixed
on
its
stand
with
a
bore
about
as
great
as
that
of
a
but
incomparably
lighter
these
two
weapons
might
at
one
discharge
have
annihilated
a
huge
mob
of
insurgents
threatening
to
storm
the
palace
were
insurrections
known
in
mars
these
men
saluted
us
by
dropping
the
points
of
their
weapons
and
inclining
the
handle
towards
us
gazing
upon
me
with
surprise
and
with
something
of
soldierly
admiration
for
physical
superiority
the
doors
wide
enough
to
admit
a
dozen
martialists
abreast
parted
and
we
entered
a
vaulted
hall
whose
arched
roof
was
supported
not
by
pillars
but
by
gigantic
statues
each
presenting
the
lustre
of
a
different
jewel
and
all
wrought
with
singular
perfection
of
proportion
and
of
beauty
here
we
were
met
by
two
officers
wearing
the
same
dress
as
the
sentries
outside
a
diaper
of
crimson
and
silver
the
rank
of
those
who
now
received
us
however
was
indicated
by
a
silver
ribbon
passing
over
the
left
shoulder
and
supporting
what
i
should
have
called
a
staff
save
that
it
was
of
metal
and
had
a
sharp
point
rendering
it
almost
as
formidable
a
weapon
as
the
rapier
exchanging
a
word
or
two
with
ergimo
these
gentlemen
ushered
us
into
a
small
room
on
the
right
where
refreshments
were
placed
before
us
eveena
whispered
me
that
she
must
not
share
our
meal
in
presence
of
these
strangers
an
intimation
which
somewhat
blunted
the
keen
appetite
i
always
derived
from
a
journey
through
the
martial
atmosphere
checked
as
it
was
however
that
appetite
seemed
a
new
astonishment
to
our
attendants
the
need
of
food
among
their
race
being
proportionate
to
their
inferior
size
and
strength
when
we
rose
i
asked
ergimo
what
was
to
become
of
eveena
as
the
officers
were
evidently
waiting
to
conduct
me
into
the
presence
of
their
sovereign
where
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
her
to
appear
he
repeated
my
question
to
the
principal
official
and
the
latter
walking
to
a
door
in
the
farther
corner
of
the
room
sounded
an
electric
signal
a
few
seconds
after
which
the
door
opened
showing
two
veiled
figures
the
pink
ground
of
whose
robes
indicated
their
matronhood
if
i
may
apply
such
a
term
to
the
relation
of
his
hundred
temporary
wives
to
the
camptâ
but
this
ground
colour
was
almost
hidden
in
the
embroidery
of
crimson
gold
and
white
which
as
i
soon
found
were
the
favourite
colours
of
the
reigning
prince
to
these
ladies
i
resigned
eveena
the
officer
saying
as
i
somewhat
reluctantly
parted
from
her
what
you
entrust
to
the
household
you
will
find
again
in
your
own
when
your
audience
is
over
whether
this
avoidance
of
all
direct
mention
of
women
were
matter
of
delicacy
or
contempt
i
hardly
knew
though
i
had
observed
it
on
former
occasions
when
the
door
closed
i
noticed
that
ergimo
had
left
us
and
the
officers
indicated
by
gesture
rather
than
by
words
that
they
were
to
lead
me
immediately
into
the
presence
i
had
considered
with
some
care
how
i
was
on
so
critical
an
occasion
to
conduct
myself
and
had
resolved
that
the
most
politic
course
would
probably
be
an
assumption
of
courteous
but
absolute
independence
to
treat
the
autocrat
of
this
planet
much
as
an
english
envoy
would
treat
an
indian
prince
it
was
in
accordance
with
this
intention
that
i
had
assumed
a
dress
somewhat
more
elaborate
than
is
usually
worn
here
a
white
suit
of
a
substance
resembling
velvet
in
texture
and
moire
in
lustre
with
collar
and
belt
of
silver
on
my
breast
i
wore
my
order
of
illegible
and
in
my
belt
my
one
cherished
terrestrial
possession
the
sword
reputed
the
best
in
asia
that
had
twice
driven
its
point
home
within
a
breadth
of
my
life
and
that
clove
the
turban
on
my
brow
but
a
minute
before
it
was
surrendered
just
in
time
to
save
its
gallant
owner
and
his
score
of
surviving
comrades
in
its
hilt
i
had
set
the
emerald
with
which
alone
the
commander
of
the
faithful
rewarded
my
services
the
turban
is
not
so
unlike
the
masculine
of
mars
as
to
attract
any
special
attention
the
hall
i
was
conducted
along
a
gallery
and
through
another
crystal
door
into
the
immediate
presence
of
the
autocrat
the
audience
chamber
was
of
no
extraordinary
size
perhaps
as
large
as
the
peristyle
of
dwelling
along
the
emerald
walls
ran
a
series
of
friezes
wrought
in
gold
representing
various
scenes
of
peace
and
war
agricultural
judicial
and
political
as
well
as
incidents
which
i
afterwards
learnt
preserved
the
memory
of
the
long
struggles
wherein
the
communists
were
finally
overthrown
the
lower
half
of
the
room
was
empty
the
upper
was
occupied
by
a
semicircle
of
seats
forming
part
of
the
building
itself
and
directly
facing
the
entrance
these
took
up
about
of
the
space
the
central
floor
being
divided
from
the
upper
portion
of
the
room
by
a
low
wall
of
metal
surmounted
by
arches
supporting
the
roof
and
hung
with
drapery
which
might
be
so
lowered
as
to
conceal
the
whole
occupied
part
of
the
chamber
the
seats
rose
in
five
tiers
one
above
the
other
the
semicircle
however
was
broken
exactly
in
the
middle
that
is
at
the
point
farthest
from
the
entrance
by
a
broad
flight
of
steps
at
the
summit
of
which
and
raised
a
very
little
above
the
seats
of
the
highest
tier
was
the
throne
supported
by
two
of
the
royal
brutes
whose
attack
had
been
so
nearly
fatal
to
myself
wrought
in
silver
their
erect
heads
forming
the
arms
and
front
about
fifty
persons
were
present
occupying
only
the
seats
nearest
to
the
throne
on
the
upper
tier
were
nine
or
ten
who
wore
a
scarlet
sash
among
whom
i
recognised
a
face
i
had
not
seen
since
the
day
of
my
memorable
visit
to
the
astronaut
not
precisely
the
face
of
a
friend
endo
zamptâ
behind
the
throne
were
ranged
a
dozen
guards
armed
with
the
spear
and
with
the
lightning
gun
used
in
hunting
that
a
single
martial
battalion
with
its
appropriate
artillery
could
annihilate
the
best
army
of
the
earth
i
could
not
but
be
aware
yet
the
first
thought
that
occurred
to
me
as
i
looked
on
these
formidably
armed
but
diminutive
soldiers
was
that
a
score
of
my
arab
horsemen
would
have
cut
a
regiment
of
them
to
pieces
but
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
steps
my
attention
was
concentrated
on
a
single
figure
and
face
the
form
and
countenance
of
the
prince
who
rose
from
his
throne
as
i
approached
those
who
remember
that
louis
a
prince
reputed
to
have
possessed
the
most
majestic
and
presence
of
his
age
was
actually
beneath
the
ordinary
height
of
frenchmen
may
be
able
to
believe
me
when
i
say
that
the
autocrat
of
mars
though
scarcely
five
feet
tall
was
in
outward
appearance
and
bearing
the
most
truly
royal
and
imposing
prince
i
have
ever
seen
his
stature
rising
nearly
two
inches
over
the
tallest
of
those
around
him
perhaps
added
to
the
effect
of
a
mien
remarkable
for
dignity
composure
and
the
predominant
and
most
immediately
observable
expression
of
his
face
was
one
of
serene
calm
and
command
a
closer
inspection
and
a
longer
experience
explained
why
notwithstanding
my
first
conception
of
his
character
and
it
was
a
true
one
ascribed
to
him
quite
as
much
of
fire
and
spirit
as
of
impassive
grandeur
his
voice
though
its
tone
was
gentle
and
almost
strikingly
quiet
had
in
it
something
of
the
ring
peculiar
to
those
which
have
sent
the
word
of
command
along
a
line
of
battle
i
felt
as
i
heard
it
more
impressed
with
the
personal
greatness
and
even
with
the
rank
and
power
of
the
prince
before
me
than
when
i
knelt
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
most
christian
king
or
stood
barefooted
before
the
greatest
modern
successor
of
the
conqueror
of
stamboul
i
am
glad
to
receive
you
he
said
it
will
be
among
the
most
memorable
incidents
of
my
reign
that
i
welcome
to
my
court
the
first
visitor
from
another
world
or
he
added
after
a
sudden
pause
and
with
an
inflection
of
unmistakable
irony
in
his
tone
the
first
who
has
descended
to
our
world
from
a
height
to
which
no
balloon
could
reach
and
at
which
no
balloonist
could
live
i
am
honoured
prince
i
replied
in
the
notice
of
a
greater
potentate
than
the
greatest
of
my
own
world
these
compliments
exchanged
the
prince
at
once
proceeded
to
more
practical
matters
aptly
however
connecting
his
next
sentence
with
the
formal
phrases
preceding
it
nevertheless
you
have
not
shown
excessive
respect
for
my
power
in
the
person
of
one
of
my
greatest
officers
if
you
treated
the
princes
of
earth
as
unceremoniously
as
the
regent
of
elcavoo
i
can
understand
that
you
found
it
convenient
to
place
yourself
beyond
their
reach
i
thought
that
this
speech
afforded
me
an
opportunity
of
repairing
my
offence
with
the
least
possible
loss
of
dignity
the
proudest
of
earthly
princes
i
replied
would
i
think
have
pardoned
the
roughness
which
forgot
the
duty
of
a
subject
in
the
first
obligations
of
humanity
no
sovereign
whom
i
have
served
but
would
have
forgiven
me
more
readily
for
rough
words
spoken
at
such
a
moment
than
for
any
delay
or
slackness
in
saving
the
life
of
a
woman
in
danger
under
his
own
eyes
permit
me
to
take
this
opportunity
of
apologizing
to
the
regent
in
your
presence
and
assuring
him
that
i
was
influenced
by
no
disrespect
to
him
but
only
by
overpowering
terror
for
another
the
lives
of
a
dozen
women
said
the
camptâ
still
with
that
covert
irony
or
sarcasm
in
his
tone
would
seem
of
less
moment
than
threats
and
actual
violence
offered
to
the
ruler
of
our
largest
and
wealthiest
dominion
the
excuse
which
endo
zamptâ
must
accept
with
a
slight
but
perceptible
emphasis
on
the
imperative
is
the
utter
difference
between
our
laws
and
ideas
and
your
own
the
regent
at
this
speech
from
his
sovereign
rose
and
made
the
usual
gesture
of
assent
inclining
his
head
and
lifting
his
left
hand
to
his
mouth
but
the
look
on
his
face
as
he
turned
it
on
me
thus
partly
concealing
it
from
the
camptâ
boded
no
good
should
i
ever
fall
into
his
power
the
prince
then
desired
me
to
give
an
account
of
the
motives
which
had
induced
my
voyage
and
the
adventures
i
had
encountered
in
reply
i
gave
him
as
briefly
and
clearly
as
i
could
a
summary
of
all
that
is
recorded
in
the
earlier
part
of
this
narrative
carefully
forbearing
to
afford
any
explanation
of
the
manner
in
which
the
apergic
force
was
generated
this
omission
the
prince
noticed
at
once
with
remarkable
quickness
you
do
not
choose
he
said
to
tell
us
your
secret
and
of
course
it
is
your
property
hereafter
however
i
shall
hope
to
purchase
it
from
you
prince
i
answered
if
one
of
your
himself
in
the
power
of
a
race
capable
of
conquering
this
world
and
destroying
its
inhabitants
would
you
forgive
him
if
he
furnished
them
with
the
means
of
reaching
you
i
think
he
replied
my
forgiveness
would
be
of
little
consequence
in
that
case
but
go
on
with
your
story
i
finished
my
narration
among
looks
of
surprise
and
incredulity
from
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
audience
which
however
i
noticed
the
less
because
the
prince
himself
listened
with
profound
interest
putting
in
now
and
then
a
question
which
indicated
his
perfect
comprehension
of
my
account
of
the
conditions
of
such
a
journey
and
of
the
means
i
had
employed
to
meet
them
before
you
were
admitted
he
said
endo
zamptâ
had
read
to
us
his
report
upon
your
vessel
and
her
machinery
an
account
which
in
every
respect
consists
with
and
supports
the
truth
of
your
relation
indeed
were
your
story
untrue
you
have
run
a
greater
risk
in
telling
it
here
than
in
the
most
daring
adventure
i
have
ever
known
or
imagined
the
court
is
dismissed
reclamomortâ
will
please
me
by
remaining
with
me
for
the
present
when
the
assembly
dispersed
i
followed
their
autocrat
at
his
desire
into
his
private
apartments
where
resting
among
a
pile
of
cushions
and
motioning
me
to
take
a
place
in
immediate
proximity
to
himself
he
continued
the
conversation
in
a
tone
and
manner
so
exactly
the
same
as
that
he
had
employed
in
public
as
to
show
that
the
latter
was
not
assumed
for
purposes
of
monarchical
but
was
the
natural
expression
of
his
own
character
as
developed
under
the
influence
of
unlimited
and
uncontradicted
power
he
only
exchanged
for
unaffected
interest
and
implied
confidence
the
tone
of
ironical
doubt
by
which
he
had
rendered
it
out
of
the
question
for
his
courtiers
to
charge
him
with
a
belief
in
that
which
public
opinion
might
pronounce
impossible
while
making
it
apparent
to
me
that
he
regarded
the
bigotry
of
scepticism
with
scarcely
veiled
contempt
i
wish
he
said
i
had
subjects
capable
of
imagining
such
an
enterprise
and
hardy
enough
to
undertake
it
but
though
we
all
profess
to
consider
knowledge
and
especially
scientific
knowledge
the
one
object
for
which
it
is
worth
while
to
live
none
of
us
would
risk
his
life
in
such
an
adventure
for
all
the
rewards
that
science
and
fame
could
give
i
think
prince
i
replied
that
i
am
in
presence
of
one
inhabitant
of
this
planet
who
would
have
dared
at
least
as
much
as
i
have
done
possibly
he
said
because
weary
as
most
of
us
profess
to
be
of
existence
the
weariest
life
in
this
world
is
that
of
him
who
rules
it
living
for
ever
under
the
silent
criticism
which
he
can
not
answer
and
bound
to
devote
his
time
and
thoughts
to
the
welfare
of
a
race
whose
utter
extermination
would
be
on
their
own
showing
the
greatest
boon
he
could
confer
upon
them
certainly
i
would
rather
be
the
discoverer
of
a
world
than
its
sovereign
he
asked
me
numerous
questions
about
the
earth
the
races
that
inhabit
it
their
several
systems
of
government
and
their
relations
to
one
another
manifesting
a
keener
interest
i
thought
in
the
great
wars
which
ended
while
i
was
yet
a
youth
than
in
any
other
subject
at
last
he
permitted
me
to
take
leave
you
are
he
said
the
most
welcome
guest
i
ever
have
or
could
have
received
a
guest
distinguished
above
all
others
by
a
power
independent
of
my
own
but
what
honour
i
can
pay
to
courage
and
enterprise
what
welcome
i
can
give
such
a
guest
shall
not
be
unworthy
of
him
or
of
myself
retire
now
to
the
home
you
will
find
prepared
for
you
i
will
only
ask
you
to
remember
that
i
have
chosen
one
near
my
own
in
order
that
i
may
see
you
often
and
learn
in
private
all
that
you
can
tell
me
at
the
entrance
of
the
apartment
i
was
met
by
the
officer
who
had
introduced
me
into
the
presence
and
conducted
at
once
to
a
door
opening
on
the
interior
court
or
peristyle
of
the
central
portion
of
the
palace
this
was
itself
a
garden
but
unlike
those
of
private
houses
a
garden
open
to
the
sky
and
traversed
by
roads
in
lieu
of
mere
paths
not
serving
as
in
private
dwellings
the
purposes
of
a
common
living
room
here
a
carriage
awaited
us
and
my
escort
requested
me
to
mount
i
had
some
misgivings
on
eveena
account
but
felt
it
necessary
to
imitate
the
reserve
and
affected
indifference
on
such
subjects
of
those
among
whom
i
had
been
thrown
at
least
until
i
somewhat
better
understood
their
ways
and
had
established
my
own
position
traversing
a
vaulted
passage
underneath
the
rearward
portion
of
the
palace
we
emerged
into
the
outer
garden
and
through
this
into
a
road
lighted
with
a
brilliancy
almost
equal
to
that
of
day
our
journey
occupied
nearly
half
an
hour
when
we
entered
an
enclosure
apparently
of
great
size
the
avenue
of
which
was
so
wide
that
without
dismounting
our
carriage
passed
directly
up
to
the
door
of
a
larger
house
than
i
had
yet
seen
chapter
xviii
a
prince
present
this
said
my
escort
as
we
dismounted
is
the
residence
assigned
to
you
by
the
camptâ
besides
the
grounds
here
enclosed
he
has
awarded
you
by
a
deed
which
will
presently
be
placed
in
your
hands
an
estate
of
some
ten
which
you
can
inspect
at
your
leisure
and
which
will
afford
you
a
revenue
as
large
as
is
enjoyed
by
any
save
by
the
twelve
regents
he
has
endeavoured
to
add
to
this
testimony
of
his
regard
by
rendering
your
household
as
complete
as
wealth
and
forethought
could
make
it
what
may
be
wanting
to
your
own
tastes
and
habits
you
will
find
no
difficulty
in
adding
we
now
entered
that
first
and
principal
chamber
of
the
mansion
wherein
it
is
customary
to
receive
all
visitors
and
transact
all
business
the
hall
was
one
of
unusual
size
and
magnificence
here
at
a
table
not
far
from
the
entrance
stood
another
official
not
wearing
the
uniform
of
the
court
with
several
documents
in
his
hand
as
he
turned
to
salute
me
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
annoyance
and
discomfiture
which
not
a
little
surprised
me
till
by
following
his
sidelong
uncomfortable
glances
i
perceived
a
veiled
feminine
figure
which
could
be
no
other
than
eveena
misreading
my
surprise
the
official
said
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
and
i
have
not
spoken
except
to
remonstrate
as
far
as
might
be
allowed
against
so
unusual
a
proceeding
he
must
have
been
astonished
and
annoyed
indeed
to
take
such
notice
of
a
stranger
wife
and
above
all
to
take
upon
himself
to
comment
on
her
conduct
for
good
or
ill
i
thought
it
best
to
make
no
reply
and
simply
saluted
him
in
form
as
i
received
the
first
paper
handed
to
me
to
which
by
the
absence
of
any
blank
space
i
perceived
that
my
signature
was
not
required
this
was
indeed
the
document
which
bestowed
on
me
the
house
and
estate
presented
by
the
sovereign
the
next
paper
handed
to
me
appeared
to
resemble
the
i
had
already
signed
save
that
but
one
blank
was
left
therein
unable
to
decipher
it
i
was
about
to
ask
the
official
to
read
it
aloud
when
eveena
who
had
stolen
up
to
me
unperceived
caught
my
arm
and
drew
me
a
little
way
aside
indifferent
to
the
wondering
glances
of
the
officials
who
had
probably
never
seen
a
woman
venture
uncalled
into
the
public
apartments
of
her
husband
house
still
less
interpose
in
any
matter
of
business
and
no
doubt
thought
that
she
was
taking
outrageous
advantage
of
my
ignorance
and
inexperience
i
will
scold
you
presently
child
i
said
quickly
and
low
what
is
it
sign
at
once
she
whispered
and
ask
no
questions
deal
with
me
as
you
will
afterwards
you
must
take
what
is
given
you
now
without
comment
or
objection
simply
expressing
your
thanks
eveena
it
is
not
safe
to
refuse
or
slight
gifts
from
such
a
quarter
she
answered
in
the
same
low
tone
trust
me
so
far
please
do
what
i
entreat
of
you
now
i
must
bear
your
displeasure
if
i
fail
to
satisfy
you
when
we
are
alone
her
manner
was
so
agitated
and
so
anxious
that
it
recalled
to
me
at
once
the
advice
of
esmo
upon
the
same
point
though
the
fears
which
had
prompted
so
strange
an
intervention
were
wholly
incomprehensible
to
me
i
knew
her
however
by
this
time
too
well
to
refuse
the
trust
she
now
for
the
first
time
claimed
and
taking
the
documents
one
by
one
as
if
i
had
perfectly
understood
them
i
wrote
my
name
in
the
space
left
blank
for
it
and
allowed
the
official
to
stamp
the
slips
without
a
word
i
then
expressed
briefly
but
earnestly
my
thanks
both
to
the
autocrat
and
to
the
officials
who
had
been
the
agents
of
his
kindness
they
retired
and
i
looked
round
for
eveena
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
i
was
about
to
comply
with
her
request
she
had
quitted
the
room
alone
in
my
own
house
knowing
nothing
of
its
geography
having
no
notion
how
to
summon
the
brute
domestics
if
indeed
the
dwelling
were
furnished
with
those
useful
creatures
without
whom
a
martial
household
would
be
signally
incomplete
i
could
only
look
for
the
spring
that
opened
the
principal
door
this
should
lead
into
the
gallery
which
as
i
judged
must
divide
the
hall
and
the
front
apartments
from
those
looking
into
the
peristyle
having
found
and
pressed
this
spring
the
door
opened
on
a
gallery
longer
wider
and
more
elaborately
ornamented
than
that
of
the
only
martial
mansions
into
which
i
had
been
hitherto
admitted
looking
round
in
no
little
perplexity
i
observed
a
niche
in
which
stood
a
statue
of
white
relieved
by
a
scarlet
background
and
beside
this
statue
crouching
and
half
hidden
a
slight
pink
object
looking
at
first
like
a
bundle
of
drapery
but
which
in
a
moment
sprang
up
and
catching
my
hand
made
me
aware
that
eveena
had
been
waiting
for
me
i
beg
you
she
said
with
an
earnestness
i
could
not
understand
i
beg
you
to
come
way
leading
me
to
the
right
for
i
had
turned
instinctively
to
the
left
in
entering
the
gallery
perhaps
because
my
room
in
esmo
house
had
lain
in
that
direction
reaching
the
end
of
the
gallery
she
turned
into
one
of
the
inner
apartments
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
us
i
felt
that
she
was
sinking
to
the
ground
as
if
the
agitation
she
had
manifested
in
the
hall
controlled
till
her
object
was
accomplished
had
now
overpowered
her
i
caught
and
carried
her
to
the
usual
pile
of
cushions
in
the
corner
the
room
according
to
universal
custom
in
martial
houses
after
sunset
was
brilliantly
lighted
by
the
electric
lamp
in
the
peristyle
and
throwing
back
her
veil
i
saw
that
she
was
pale
to
ghastliness
and
almost
fainting
in
my
ignorance
of
my
own
house
i
could
call
for
no
help
and
employ
no
other
restoratives
than
fond
words
and
caresses
under
this
treatment
nevertheless
she
recovered
perhaps
as
quickly
as
under
any
which
the
faculty
might
have
prescribed
she
was
still
however
much
more
distressed
than
mere
consciousness
of
the
grave
solecism
she
had
committed
could
explain
but
i
had
no
other
clue
to
her
trouble
and
could
only
hope
that
in
repudiating
this
she
would
explain
its
real
cause
come
bambina
i
expostulated
we
understand
one
another
too
well
by
this
time
for
you
to
wrong
me
by
all
this
alarm
i
know
that
you
would
not
have
broken
through
the
customs
of
your
people
without
good
reason
and
you
know
that
even
if
your
reason
were
not
sufficient
i
should
not
be
hard
upon
the
error
i
am
sure
you
would
not
she
said
but
this
time
you
have
to
consider
others
and
you
can
not
let
it
be
supposed
that
you
do
not
know
a
wife
duty
or
will
allow
your
authority
to
be
set
at
naught
in
your
own
household
what
matter
do
you
suppose
i
listen
in
the
roads
care
for
gossip
i
rejoined
household
rule
is
a
matter
of
the
veil
and
no
one
not
even
your
autocratic
prince
will
venture
to
lift
it
you
have
not
lifted
it
yourself
yet
she
answered
you
will
understand
me
when
you
have
looked
at
the
slips
you
were
about
to
make
them
read
aloud
had
i
not
interrupted
you
bead
them
yourself
i
said
handing
to
her
the
papers
i
still
held
and
which
after
her
interposition
i
had
not
attempted
to
decipher
she
took
them
but
with
a
visible
shudder
of
reluctance
not
stronger
than
came
over
me
before
she
had
read
three
lines
aloud
had
i
known
their
purport
i
doubt
whether
even
eveena
persuasion
and
the
autocrat
power
together
could
have
induced
me
to
sign
them
they
were
in
very
truth
contracts
of
marriage
if
marriage
it
can
be
called
the
sovereign
had
done
me
the
unusual
but
not
wholly
unprecedented
favour
of
selecting
half
a
dozen
of
the
fairest
maidens
of
those
waiting
their
fate
in
the
nurseries
of
his
empire
had
proffered
on
my
behoof
terms
which
satisfied
their
ambition
gratified
their
vanity
and
would
have
induced
them
to
accept
any
suitor
so
recommended
without
the
insignificant
formality
of
a
personal
courtship
it
had
seemed
to
him
only
a
gracious
attention
to
complete
my
household
and
he
had
furnished
me
with
a
bevy
of
wives
as
i
presently
found
he
had
selected
a
complete
set
of
the
most
intelligent
carvee
and
which
he
could
procure
without
either
the
one
or
the
other
the
dwelling
he
had
given
me
would
have
seemed
equally
empty
or
incomplete
this
mark
of
royal
favour
astounded
and
dismayed
me
more
than
eveena
herself
if
she
had
entertained
the
wish
she
would
hardly
have
acknowledged
to
herself
the
hope
that
she
might
remain
permanently
the
sole
partner
of
my
home
but
so
sudden
speedy
and
wholesale
an
intrusion
thereon
she
certainly
had
not
expected
even
in
mars
a
first
bride
generally
enjoys
for
some
time
a
monopoly
of
her
society
if
she
can
not
be
said
to
enchain
his
affection
it
was
hard
indeed
before
the
thirtieth
day
after
her
marriage
to
find
herself
but
one
in
a
numerous
family
the
harder
that
our
union
had
from
the
first
been
close
intimate
unrestrainedly
confidential
as
it
can
hardly
be
where
neither
expects
that
the
tie
can
remain
exclusive
and
because
she
had
learned
to
realise
and
rest
upon
such
love
as
belongs
to
a
life
in
which
woman
never
affecting
the
independence
of
coequal
partnership
has
never
yet
sunk
by
reaction
into
a
mere
slave
and
toy
it
was
hard
cruelly
hard
on
one
who
had
given
in
the
first
hour
of
marriage
and
never
failed
to
give
a
love
whose
devotion
had
no
limit
no
reserve
or
qualification
a
submission
that
was
less
or
than
the
absolute
surrender
of
self
of
will
feeling
and
to
the
judgment
and
pleasure
of
him
she
loved
hard
on
her
who
had
neither
thought
nor
care
for
herself
as
apart
from
me
when
i
understood
to
what
i
had
actually
committed
myself
i
snatched
the
papers
from
her
and
might
have
torn
them
to
pieces
but
for
the
gentle
restraining
hand
she
laid
upon
mine
you
can
not
help
it
she
said
the
tears
falling
from
her
eyes
but
with
a
of
which
i
could
not
have
supposed
her
capable
it
seems
hard
on
me
but
it
is
better
so
it
is
not
that
you
are
not
content
with
me
not
that
you
love
me
less
i
can
bear
it
better
when
it
comes
from
a
stranger
and
is
forced
upon
you
without
and
even
i
think
against
your
will
the
pressure
of
the
arm
that
clasped
her
waist
and
the
hand
that
held
her
own
was
a
sufficient
answer
to
any
doubt
that
might
be
implied
in
her
last
words
and
lifting
her
eyes
to
mine
she
said
i
shall
always
remember
this
i
shall
always
think
that
you
were
sorry
not
to
have
at
least
a
little
while
longer
alone
with
me
it
is
selfish
to
feel
glad
that
you
are
pained
but
your
sympathy
your
sharing
my
own
feeling
comforts
me
as
i
never
could
have
been
comforted
when
as
must
have
happened
sooner
or
later
you
had
found
for
yourself
another
companion
child
do
you
mean
to
say
there
is
portal
to
this
passage
and
that
however
much
against
my
will
i
am
bound
to
women
i
have
never
seen
and
never
wish
to
see
you
have
signed
replied
eveena
gently
the
contracts
are
stamped
and
are
in
the
official
hands
and
you
could
not
attempt
to
break
them
without
giving
mortal
offence
to
the
prince
who
has
intended
you
a
signal
favour
besides
these
girls
themselves
have
done
no
wrong
and
deserve
no
affront
or
unkindness
from
you
i
was
silent
for
some
minutes
at
first
simply
astounded
at
the
calm
magnanimity
which
was
mingled
with
her
perfect
simplicity
then
pondering
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
can
we
not
escape
i
said
at
last
rather
to
myself
than
to
her
escape
she
repeated
with
surprise
and
from
what
the
favour
shown
you
by
our
sovereign
the
wealth
he
has
bestowed
the
personal
interest
he
has
taken
in
perfecting
every
detail
of
one
of
the
most
splendid
homes
ever
given
save
to
a
prince
every
incident
of
your
position
make
you
the
most
envied
man
in
this
world
and
you
would
escape
from
them
gazing
for
a
few
moments
in
my
face
she
added
these
maidens
were
chosen
as
the
loveliest
in
all
the
nurseries
of
two
continents
every
one
of
them
far
more
beautiful
than
i
can
be
even
in
your
eyes
pray
do
not
for
my
sake
be
unkind
to
them
or
try
to
dislike
them
what
is
it
you
would
escape
being
false
to
you
i
answered
if
nothing
else
false
she
echoed
in
unaffected
wonder
what
did
you
promise
me
again
i
was
silenced
by
the
loyal
simplicity
with
which
she
followed
out
ideas
so
strange
to
me
that
their
consequences
however
logical
i
could
never
anticipate
and
could
hardly
admit
to
be
sound
even
when
so
directly
and
distinctly
deduced
as
now
from
the
intolerable
consistency
of
the
premises
but
i
answered
at
last
how
much
did
promise
eveena
and
how
much
more
have
you
given
nothing
she
replied
that
i
did
not
owe
you
won
your
right
to
all
the
love
i
could
give
before
you
asked
for
it
and
since
we
along
opposite
lines
madonna
but
we
would
both
give
and
risk
much
to
avoid
what
is
before
us
let
me
ask
your
father
whether
it
be
not
yet
possible
to
return
to
my
vessel
and
leave
a
world
so
uncongenial
to
both
of
us
you
can
not
she
answered
try
to
escape
you
insult
the
prince
you
put
yourself
and
me
for
whom
you
fear
more
in
the
power
of
a
malignant
enemy
you
can
not
guide
a
balloon
or
a
vessel
if
you
could
get
possession
of
one
and
within
a
few
hours
after
your
departure
was
known
every
road
and
every
port
would
be
closed
to
you
can
i
not
send
to
your
father
i
said
probably
she
replied
i
think
we
shall
find
a
telegraph
in
your
office
if
you
will
allow
me
to
enter
there
now
there
is
no
one
to
see
and
it
must
be
morning
in
ecasfe
familiar
with
the
construction
and
arrangement
of
a
martial
house
eveena
immediately
crossed
the
gallery
to
what
she
called
the
office
the
front
room
on
the
right
where
the
head
of
the
house
carries
on
his
work
or
study
here
above
a
desk
attached
to
the
wall
was
one
of
those
instruments
whose
manipulation
was
simple
enough
for
a
novice
like
myself
but
i
said
i
can
not
write
your
stylic
characters
and
if
i
used
the
phonic
letters
a
message
from
me
would
be
very
likely
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
officials
who
would
care
about
no
other
may
i
she
suggested
write
your
message
for
you
and
put
your
purport
in
words
that
will
be
understood
by
my
father
alone
do
i
rejoined
but
do
it
in
my
name
and
i
will
sign
it
under
her
direction
i
took
the
stylus
or
pencil
and
the
slip
of
she
offered
me
and
wrote
my
name
at
the
head
after
eliciting
the
exact
purport
of
the
message
i
desired
to
send
and
meditating
for
some
moments
she
wrote
and
read
out
to
me
words
literally
translated
as
follows
the
rich
aviary
my
thought
over
full
i
would
breathe
home
air
the
sense
of
which
as
i
could
already
understand
was
a
splendid
mansion
has
been
given
us
but
my
has
found
it
too
full
i
wish
for
my
native
air
prescribe
the
brevity
of
the
message
was
very
characteristic
of
the
language
equally
characteristic
of
the
stylography
was
the
fact
that
the
words
occupied
about
an
inch
beyond
the
address
following
her
pencil
as
she
pointed
to
the
ciphers
i
said
is
not
a
false
concord
and
why
have
you
used
the
past
tense
this
pedantry
applying
to
martial
grammar
the
rules
of
that
with
which
my
boyhood
had
been
painfully
familiarised
provoked
amid
all
our
trouble
eveena
low
laugh
i
meant
it
she
answered
my
father
will
look
at
his
writing
with
both
eyes
well
you
are
out
of
reach
even
of
the
leveloo
she
laughed
again
she
said
the
changed
accentuation
turning
the
former
words
into
the
name
of
my
with
the
interrogative
syllable
annexed
this
message
despatched
we
could
only
await
the
reply
nestling
among
the
cushions
at
my
knee
her
head
resting
on
my
breast
eveena
said
and
now
forgive
my
presumption
in
counselling
you
and
my
reminding
you
of
what
is
painful
to
both
but
what
to
us
is
as
the
course
of
the
clock
is
strange
as
the
stars
to
you
you
must
see
and
must
order
all
household
arrangements
and
glancing
at
a
dial
fixed
in
the
wall
the
black
is
driving
down
the
green
so
much
the
better
i
said
i
shall
have
less
time
to
speak
to
them
and
less
chance
of
speaking
or
looking
my
mind
and
as
to
arrangements
those
of
course
you
must
make
i
forgive
me
she
answered
that
is
impossible
it
is
for
you
to
assign
to
each
of
us
her
part
in
the
household
her
chamber
her
rank
and
duties
you
forget
that
i
hold
exactly
the
same
position
with
the
youngest
among
them
and
can
not
presume
even
to
suggest
much
less
to
direct
i
was
silent
and
after
a
pause
she
went
on
it
is
not
for
me
to
advise
you
but
speak
your
thought
now
and
always
eveena
even
if
i
did
not
stand
in
so
much
need
of
your
guidance
in
a
new
world
i
never
yet
refused
to
hear
counsel
and
it
is
a
wife
right
to
offer
it
is
it
we
are
not
so
taught
she
answered
i
am
afraid
you
have
rougher
ground
to
steer
over
than
you
are
aware
alone
with
you
i
hope
i
should
have
done
nay
best
remembering
the
lesson
of
the
leveloo
never
to
give
you
the
pain
of
teaching
a
different
one
but
we
shall
no
longer
be
alone
and
you
can
not
hope
to
manage
seven
as
you
might
manage
one
moreover
these
girls
have
neither
had
that
first
experience
of
your
nature
which
made
that
lesson
so
impressive
to
me
nor
the
kindly
and
gentle
training
under
a
mother
care
and
a
father
mild
authority
that
i
had
enjoyed
they
would
not
understand
the
control
that
is
not
enforced
they
will
obey
when
they
must
and
will
feel
that
they
must
obey
when
they
can
not
deceive
and
dare
not
rebel
do
not
think
hardly
of
them
for
this
they
have
known
no
life
but
that
of
the
strict
clockwork
routine
of
a
great
nursery
where
no
personal
affection
and
no
rule
but
that
of
force
is
possible
i
understand
madonna
your
prince
gift
puts
a
man
in
charge
of
young
ladies
hitherto
brought
up
among
women
only
and
of
course
petty
petulant
frivolous
as
women
left
to
themselves
ever
are
i
wish
you
could
see
the
ridiculous
side
of
the
matter
which
occurs
to
me
as
i
see
the
painful
aspect
which
alone
is
plain
to
you
i
can
scarcely
help
laughing
at
the
chance
which
has
assigned
to
me
the
daily
personal
management
of
and
who
must
also
be
wives
i
do
think
you
need
fear
that
i
shall
deal
with
them
as
with
you
as
a
man
of
sense
and
feeling
must
deal
with
a
woman
whose
own
instincts
affection
and
judgment
are
sufficient
for
her
guidance
i
never
saw
much
of
girls
or
children
i
remember
no
home
but
the
western
school
and
the
oriental
camp
i
never
as
soldier
or
envoy
was
acquainted
with
other
men
homes
while
still
beardless
i
have
ruled
bearded
soldiers
by
a
discipline
whose
sanctions
were
the
and
the
bastinado
and
when
i
left
the
camp
and
court
it
was
for
colleges
where
a
beardless
face
is
never
seen
i
must
look
to
you
to
teach
me
how
discipline
may
be
softened
to
suit
feminine
softness
and
what
milder
sanction
may
replace
the
noose
and
the
stick
of
the
persian
executioner
i
can
not
believe
eveena
answered
taking
me
as
usual
to
the
letter
that
you
will
ever
draw
the
zone
too
tight
we
say
that
is
the
worst
tyranny
laxity
which
leaves
us
to
quarrel
and
torment
each
other
tenderness
which
encourages
disorder
and
disobedience
till
they
must
be
put
down
perforce
is
ultimate
unkindness
i
will
not
tell
you
that
such
indulgence
will
give
you
endless
trouble
win
you
neither
love
nor
respect
and
probably
teach
its
objects
to
laugh
at
you
under
the
veil
you
will
care
more
for
this
that
you
would
find
yourself
forced
at
last
to
change
hand
for
leathern
band
believe
me
my
our
comfort
and
happiness
must
depend
on
your
grasping
the
helm
at
once
and
firmly
ruling
us
and
ruling
with
a
strong
hand
otherwise
your
home
will
resemble
the
most
miserable
of
all
scenes
of
discomfort
an
ungoverned
school
and
the
most
severe
and
arbitrary
household
rule
is
better
by
far
than
that
and
forgive
me
once
more
but
do
not
speak
as
if
you
would
deal
one
measure
with
the
left
hand
and
another
with
the
right
surely
you
do
not
so
misunderstand
me
as
to
think
i
counselled
you
to
treat
myself
differently
from
others
rule
only
can
be
gentle
if
you
show
favouritism
at
first
you
will
find
yourself
driven
step
by
step
to
do
what
you
will
feel
to
be
cruel
what
will
pain
yourself
perhaps
more
than
any
one
else
you
may
make
envy
and
dislike
bite
hold
their
tongues
but
you
can
not
prevent
their
stinging
under
the
veil
therefore
once
more
you
can
not
let
my
interference
pass
as
if
none
but
you
knew
of
it
madonna
if
i
to
rule
such
a
household
i
will
rule
as
absolutely
as
your
autocratic
prince
i
will
tolerate
no
criticism
and
no
questions
you
surely
forget
she
urged
that
they
know
my
offence
and
do
not
know
must
not
know
what
in
your
judgment
excuses
it
let
them
once
learn
that
it
is
possible
so
to
force
the
springs
bolts
without
a
sting
it
will
take
a
of
tears
to
blot
the
lesson
from
their
memory
what
would
you
have
eveena
am
i
to
deal
unjustly
that
i
may
seem
just
that
course
steers
straight
to
disaster
and
had
you
been
in
fault
could
i
humble
you
in
other
eyes
if
i
feel
hurt
by
any
mark
of
your
displeasure
or
humbled
that
it
should
be
known
to
my
equals
in
your
own
household
she
replied
it
is
time
i
were
deprived
of
the
privileges
that
have
rendered
me
so
overweening
my
answer
was
intercepted
by
the
sound
of
an
electric
bell
or
miniature
gong
and
a
slip
of
tafroo
fell
upon
the
desk
the
first
words
were
in
that
vocal
character
which
i
had
mastered
and
came
from
esmo
hysterical
folly
he
had
said
mountain
air
might
be
fatal
and
clear
nights
are
dangerously
cold
for
more
than
yourselves
what
does
he
mean
i
asked
as
i
read
out
a
formula
more
studiously
occult
than
those
of
the
pharmacopoeia
that
i
am
unpardonably
silly
and
that
you
must
not
dream
of
going
back
to
your
vessel
the
last
words
i
suppose
warn
you
how
carefully
in
such
a
household
you
need
to
guard
the
secrets
of
the
starlight
well
and
what
is
this
in
the
stylic
writing
eveena
glanced
over
it
and
coloured
painfully
the
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes
that
she
said
pointing
to
the
first
cipher
is
my
signature
then
i
said
it
is
meant
for
you
not
for
me
nay
she
answered
do
you
think
i
could
take
advantage
of
your
not
knowing
the
character
and
she
read
words
quite
as
incomprehensible
to
me
as
the
writing
itself
can
a
star
mislead
the
blind
i
should
veil
myself
in
crimson
if
i
have
trained
a
bird
to
snatch
sugar
from
full
hands
must
even
your
womanhood
reverse
the
clasps
of
your
childhood
it
chimes
midnight
twice
i
said
a
martial
phrase
meaning
am
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
do
not
translate
it
carissima
i
can
read
in
your
face
that
it
is
unjust
reproachful
where
you
deserve
no
reproach
nay
when
you
so
wrong
my
mother
i
must
tell
you
exactly
what
she
means
a
child
of
the
star
take
advantage
of
one
who
relies
on
her
to
explain
the
customs
of
a
world
unknown
to
him
i
blush
to
think
that
my
child
can
abuse
the
tenderness
of
one
who
is
too
eager
to
indulge
her
fancies
you
see
she
is
quite
right
you
do
trust
me
so
absolutely
you
are
so
strangely
to
me
it
is
shameful
i
should
vex
you
by
fretting
because
you
are
forced
to
do
what
you
might
well
have
done
at
your
own
pleasure
my
own
i
was
more
than
vexed
chiefly
perhaps
for
your
sake
but
not
by
you
where
any
other
woman
would
have
stung
the
sore
by
sending
fresh
sparks
along
the
wire
you
thought
only
to
spare
me
the
pain
of
seeing
you
pained
but
what
do
the
last
words
mean
no
for
i
saw
the
colour
deepen
on
her
face
better
leave
unread
what
we
know
to
be
written
in
error
but
the
less
agreeable
a
supposed
duty
the
more
resolute
was
eveena
to
fulfil
it
they
were
meant
to
recall
a
saying
familiar
in
every
school
and
household
she
said
loosed
and
zone
childhood
spares
the
woman
grown
change
the
clasps
and
woman
yet
pays
with
interest
childhood
debt
this
tightening
and
relaxing
the
clasp
of
her
zone
is
the
symbol
of
stricter
or
more
indulgent
household
rule
then
bending
so
as
to
avert
her
face
she
unclasped
her
embroidered
sandal
and
gave
it
into
my
hand
and
this
is
what
i
suppose
you
would
call
its
sanction
there
is
more
to
be
said
for
the
sandal
than
i
supposed
bambina
if
it
have
helped
to
make
you
what
you
are
but
you
may
tell
zulve
that
its
work
and
hers
are
done
kneeling
before
her
i
kissed
with
more
studied
reverence
than
the
sacred
stone
of
the
caaba
the
tiny
foot
on
which
i
replaced
its
covering
baby
as
she
thinks
and
i
call
you
eveena
you
are
fast
unteaching
me
the
lesson
which
before
you
were
born
and
ever
since
the
women
of
the
earth
have
done
their
utmost
to
impress
indelibly
upon
my
mind
the
lesson
that
woman
is
but
a
less
lovable
more
petulant
more
deeply
and
incurably
spoilt
child
your
mother
reproach
is
an
exact
inversion
of
the
truth
no
one
could
have
acted
with
more
utter
unselfishness
more
devoted
kindness
more
exquisite
delicacy
than
you
have
shown
in
this
miserable
matter
i
could
not
have
believed
that
even
you
could
have
put
aside
your
own
feelings
so
completely
could
have
recognised
so
promptly
that
i
was
not
in
fault
have
thought
so
exclusively
of
what
was
best
and
safe
for
me
in
the
first
place
and
next
of
what
was
kind
and
just
and
generous
to
your
rivals
i
never
thought
such
reasonableness
and
justice
possible
to
feminine
nature
and
if
i
can
not
love
you
more
dearly
you
have
taught
me
how
deeply
to
admire
and
honour
you
i
accept
the
situation
since
you
will
have
it
so
be
as
just
and
considerate
henceforward
as
you
have
been
and
trust
me
that
it
shall
bring
no
shadow
between
us
shall
never
make
you
less
to
me
than
you
are
now
but
it
must
she
insisted
i
can
not
now
be
other
than
one
wife
among
many
and
what
place
i
hold
among
them
is
remember
for
you
and
you
alone
to
fix
no
rule
no
custom
obliges
you
to
give
any
preference
in
form
or
fact
to
one
merely
because
you
chanced
to
marry
her
first
such
nevertheless
did
not
seem
to
be
the
practice
in
your
house
your
mother
was
as
distinctly
wife
and
mistress
as
if
his
sole
companion
my
father
she
replied
did
not
marry
a
second
time
till
within
my
own
memory
and
it
was
natural
and
usual
to
give
the
first
place
to
one
so
much
older
and
more
experienced
i
have
no
such
claim
and
when
you
see
my
companions
you
may
find
good
reason
to
think
that
i
am
the
least
fit
of
all
to
take
the
first
place
nor
she
added
drawing
me
from
the
room
do
i
wish
it
if
only
you
will
keep
in
your
mind
one
little
place
for
the
memory
of
our
visit
to
your
vessel
and
your
promise
respecting
it
i
shall
be
more
than
content
eveena
humble
unconscious
was
rendering
the
conversation
intolerably
painful
and
even
the
embarrassing
situation
now
at
hand
was
a
welcome
interruption
eveena
paused
before
a
door
opening
from
the
gallery
into
one
of
the
rooms
looking
on
the
peristyle
you
will
find
them
there
she
said
drawing
back
come
with
me
then
i
answered
and
as
she
shrank
away
i
tightened
my
clasp
of
her
waist
and
drew
her
forward
the
door
opened
and
we
found
ourselves
in
presence
of
six
veiled
ladies
in
pink
and
silver
all
of
them
with
one
exception
a
little
taller
and
less
slight
than
my
bride
eveena
with
the
kindness
which
never
failed
under
the
most
painful
trial
or
the
most
powerful
impulses
of
natural
feeling
extricated
herself
gently
from
my
hold
took
the
hand
of
the
first
and
brought
her
up
to
me
the
girl
was
evidently
startled
at
the
first
sight
of
her
new
possessor
and
alarmed
by
a
figure
so
much
larger
and
more
powerful
than
any
she
had
ever
seen
exceeding
probably
the
picture
drawn
by
her
imagination
this
said
eveena
gently
and
gravely
is
eunané
the
prettiest
and
most
accomplished
scholar
in
her
nursery
as
i
was
about
to
acknowledge
the
introduction
with
the
same
cold
politeness
with
which
i
should
have
bowed
to
a
strange
guest
on
earth
eveena
took
my
left
hand
in
her
own
and
laid
it
on
the
maiden
veil
recalling
to
me
at
once
the
proprieties
of
the
occasion
and
the
justice
she
had
claimed
for
her
unoffending
and
unintentional
rivals
but
at
the
same
time
bringing
back
in
full
force
a
remembrance
she
could
not
have
forgotten
but
whose
effect
upon
myself
the
ideas
to
which
she
was
habituated
rendered
her
unable
to
anticipate
to
accept
in
her
presence
a
second
bride
by
the
same
ceremonial
act
which
had
so
lately
asserted
my
claim
to
herself
was
intensely
repugnant
to
my
feelings
and
only
her
own
influence
could
have
overcome
my
reluctance
my
hesitation
was
i
fear
perceptible
to
eunané
for
as
i
removed
her
veil
and
her
expression
and
a
colour
somewhat
brighter
than
that
of
mere
maiden
shyness
indicated
disappointment
or
mortified
pride
she
was
certainly
very
beautiful
and
perhaps
had
i
now
seen
them
both
for
the
first
time
i
might
have
acquiesced
in
the
truth
of
eveena
as
it
was
nothing
could
associate
with
the
bright
intelligent
face
the
clear
grey
eyes
and
light
brown
hair
the
lithe
active
form
instinct
with
nervous
energy
that
charm
which
from
our
first
acquaintance
their
expression
of
gentle
kindness
and
later
the
devoted
affection
visible
in
every
look
had
given
to
eveena
features
it
is
i
suppose
hardly
natural
to
man
to
feel
actual
unkindness
towards
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
who
has
given
no
personal
offence
having
once
admitted
the
justice
of
eveena
plea
and
feeling
that
she
would
be
more
pained
by
the
omission
than
by
the
fulfilment
of
the
forms
which
courtesy
and
common
kindness
imperatively
demanded
i
kissed
eunané
brow
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
her
with
as
much
of
tenderness
as
i
could
feel
or
affect
for
eveena
rival
after
what
had
passed
to
endear
eveena
more
than
ever
the
latter
waited
a
little
to
allow
me
spontaneously
to
perform
the
same
ceremony
with
the
other
girls
but
seeing
my
hesitation
she
came
forward
again
and
presented
severally
four
others
enva
snow
blanche
leenoo
rose
eiralé
elfé
all
more
or
less
of
the
usual
type
of
female
beauty
in
mars
with
long
full
tresses
varying
in
tinge
from
flax
to
deep
gold
or
the
lightest
brown
each
with
features
almost
faultless
and
with
all
the
attraction
to
me
unfailing
possessed
for
men
who
have
passed
their
youth
by
beauté
du
the
bloom
of
pure
graceful
girlhood
eivé
the
sixth
of
the
party
standing
on
the
right
of
the
others
and
therefore
last
in
place
according
to
martial
usage
was
smaller
and
slighter
than
eveena
herself
and
made
an
individual
impression
on
my
attention
by
a
manifest
timidity
and
agitation
greater
than
any
of
the
rest
had
evinced
as
i
removed
her
veil
i
was
struck
by
the
total
unlikeness
which
her
face
and
form
presented
to
those
i
had
just
saluted
her
hair
was
so
dark
as
by
contrast
to
seem
black
her
complexion
less
fair
than
those
of
her
companions
though
as
fair
as
that
of
an
average
greek
beauty
her
eyes
of
deepest
brown
her
limbs
and
especially
the
hands
and
feet
marvellously
perfect
in
shape
and
colour
but
in
the
delicacy
and
minuteness
of
their
form
suggesting
as
did
all
the
proportions
of
her
tiny
figure
the
peculiar
grace
of
childhood
an
image
in
miniature
of
faultless
physical
beauty
in
eivé
alone
of
the
bevy
i
felt
a
real
interest
but
the
interest
called
forth
by
a
singularly
pretty
child
in
whose
expression
the
first
glance
discerns
a
character
it
will
take
long
to
read
rather
than
that
commanded
by
the
charms
of
earliest
womanhood
when
i
had
completed
the
ceremonial
round
there
was
a
somewhat
awkward
silence
which
eveena
at
last
broke
by
suggesting
that
eunané
should
show
us
through
the
house
with
which
she
had
made
the
earliest
acquaintance
this
young
girl
readily
took
the
lead
thus
assigned
to
her
and
by
some
delicate
manoeuvre
whose
authorship
i
could
not
doubt
i
found
her
hand
in
mine
as
we
made
our
tour
the
number
of
chambers
was
much
greater
than
in
esmo
dwelling
the
garden
of
the
peristyle
larger
and
more
elaborately
arranged
if
not
more
beautiful
the
ambau
were
more
numerous
than
even
the
domestic
service
of
so
large
a
mansion
appeared
to
require
the
birds
whose
duties
lay
outside
were
by
this
time
asleep
on
their
perches
and
we
forbore
to
disturb
them
the
central
chamber
of
the
seraglio
if
i
may
so
call
it
the
largest
and
midmost
of
those
in
the
rear
of
the
garden
devoted
as
of
course
to
the
ladies
of
the
household
was
especially
magnificent
when
we
stood
in
its
midst
shy
looks
askance
from
all
the
six
betrayed
their
secret
ambition
though
eivé
was
but
momentary
and
so
slight
that
i
felt
i
might
have
unfairly
suspected
her
of
presumption
i
left
this
room
however
in
silence
and
assigned
to
each
of
my
maiden
brides
in
order
as
they
had
been
presented
to
me
the
rooms
on
the
left
and
then
as
we
stood
once
more
in
the
peristyle
having
postponed
all
further
arrangements
all
distribution
of
household
duties
to
the
morrow
assigning
however
to
eunané
whose
native
energy
and
forwardness
had
made
early
acquaintance
with
the
dwelling
and
its
dumb
inhabitants
the
charge
of
providing
and
preparing
with
their
assistance
our
morning
meal
i
said
i
have
let
the
business
of
the
evening
zyda
actually
encroach
on
midnight
and
must
detain
you
from
your
rest
no
longer
eveena
you
know
i
still
have
need
of
you
she
was
standing
at
a
little
distance
next
to
eunané
and
the
latter
with
a
smile
half
malicious
half
triumphant
whispered
something
in
her
ear
there
was
a
suppressed
annoyance
in
eveena
look
which
provoked
me
to
interpose
on
earth
i
should
never
have
been
fool
enough
to
meddle
in
a
woman
quarrel
the
weakest
can
take
her
own
part
in
the
warfare
of
taunt
and
innuendo
better
and
more
venomously
than
could
dervish
priest
or
politician
but
eveena
could
no
more
lower
herself
to
the
ordinary
level
of
feminine
malice
than
i
could
have
borne
to
hear
her
do
so
and
it
was
intolerable
that
one
whose
sweet
humility
commanded
respect
from
myself
should
submit
to
slight
or
sneer
from
the
lips
and
eyes
of
petulant
girls
eunané
started
as
i
spoke
using
that
accent
which
gives
its
most
peremptory
force
to
the
martial
imperative
repeat
aloud
what
you
have
chosen
to
say
to
eveena
in
my
presence
if
the
first
to
express
the
excited
by
eveena
evident
influence
though
exerted
in
their
own
behalf
it
was
less
that
eunané
surpassed
her
companions
in
malice
than
that
they
fell
short
of
her
in
audacity
her
had
found
her
their
most
daring
leader
in
mischief
the
least
reluctant
scapegoat
when
mischief
was
to
be
atoned
but
she
was
cowed
partly
perhaps
by
her
first
collision
with
masculine
authority
partly
i
fear
by
sheer
dread
of
physical
force
visibly
greater
than
she
had
ever
known
by
repute
perhaps
she
was
too
much
frightened
to
obey
at
any
rate
it
was
from
eveena
despite
her
pleading
looks
that
i
extorted
an
answer
she
yielded
at
last
only
to
that
formal
imperative
which
her
conscience
would
not
permit
her
to
disobey
and
which
for
the
first
time
i
now
employed
in
addressing
her
eunané
only
repeated
eveena
said
with
a
reluctance
so
manifest
that
one
might
have
supposed
her
to
be
the
offender
a
proverb
the
wrath
that
stands
to
cool
then
the
sandal
shows
the
rule
the
smile
that
had
accompanied
the
whisper
though
not
so
much
suggestive
of
a
woman
malignity
as
of
a
child
exultation
in
a
companion
disgrace
gave
point
and
sting
to
the
taunt
it
is
on
chance
i
suppose
that
the
effect
of
such
things
depends
had
the
saying
been
thrown
at
any
of
eunané
equals
i
should
probably
have
been
inclined
to
laugh
even
if
i
felt
it
necessary
to
reprimand
but
angered
at
a
hint
which
placed
eveena
on
their
own
level
i
forgot
how
far
the
speaker
experience
and
inexperience
alike
palliated
the
impertinence
that
the
insinuation
shocked
none
of
those
around
me
was
evident
theirs
were
not
the
looks
of
women
however
young
and
thoughtless
startled
by
an
affront
to
their
sex
but
of
children
amazed
at
a
child
folly
in
provoking
capricious
and
irresponsible
power
the
angry
quickness
with
which
i
turned
to
eunané
received
a
double
though
doubly
unintentional
rebuke
equally
illustrative
of
martial
ideas
and
usages
the
culprit
cowered
like
a
child
expecting
a
brutal
blow
a
gentle
pressure
on
my
left
arm
evinced
the
same
fear
in
a
quarter
from
which
its
expression
wounded
me
deeply
that
pressure
arrested
not
as
was
intended
my
hand
but
my
voice
and
when
i
spoke
the
frightened
girl
looked
up
in
surprise
at
its
measured
tones
wrong
and
wrong
thrice
over
eunané
it
is
for
me
to
teach
you
the
bad
taste
of
bringing
into
your
new
home
the
ideas
and
language
of
school
meanwhile
in
no
case
would
you
learn
more
of
my
rule
than
concerned
your
own
fault
take
in
exchange
for
your
proverb
the
kindliest
i
have
learned
in
your
language
warnings
reach
the
heart
veil
the
blush
and
spare
the
smart
but
happily
for
you
your
taunt
had
not
truth
enough
to
sting
and
i
can
tell
the
story
about
which
you
are
unduly
curious
as
frankly
as
you
let
me
speak
now
eveena
that
i
may
spare
the
need
to
speak
again
and
in
another
that
eveena
seemed
to
have
put
us
both
in
a
false
position
only
convinced
me
that
she
had
a
motive
she
knew
would
satisfy
me
as
fully
as
herself
when
i
learned
what
that
motive
was
i
was
greatly
surprised
at
her
unselfishness
and
courage
if
you
threw
me
your
veil
to
save
me
from
drowning
how
would
you
feel
if
my
first
words
to
you
were
one
must
think
i
could
not
swim
therefore
even
the
household
must
believe
you
in
unveiling
guilty
of
an
unpardonable
fault
answer
me
eunané
i
should
let
you
sink
next
time
she
replied
with
a
pretty
sauciness
showing
that
her
worst
fears
at
least
were
relieved
quite
right
but
you
are
less
generous
than
eveena
to
hide
how
i
had
acted
on
her
advice
she
would
have
had
you
suppose
her
guilty
that
you
might
not
laugh
at
my
authority
and
a
dragon
in
the
nest
she
would
have
had
me
treat
her
as
guilty
but
i
deserved
it
a
girl
has
no
right
to
break
the
seal
in
the
master
absence
interposed
eveena
much
more
distressed
than
gratified
by
the
vindication
to
which
she
was
so
well
entitled
let
your
tongue
sleep
eveena
so
with
a
kiss
i
blot
your
first
miscalculation
eunané
earth
the
evening
star
of
mars
light
your
dreams
it
was
with
visible
reluctance
that
eveena
followed
me
into
the
chamber
we
had
last
left
and
she
expostulated
as
earnestly
as
her
obedience
would
permit
against
the
fiat
that
assigned
it
to
her
choose
what
room
you
please
then
i
said
but
understand
that
so
far
as
my
will
and
my
trust
can
make
you
you
are
the
mistress
here
well
then
she
answered
give
me
the
little
octagon
beside
your
own
the
smallest
and
simplest
but
to
my
taste
the
prettiest
room
in
the
house
i
should
like
to
be
near
you
still
if
i
may
but
believe
me
i
shall
not
be
frozen
hurt
because
you
think
another
hand
better
able
to
steer
the
carriage
if
mine
may
sometimes
rest
in
yours
leading
her
into
the
room
she
had
chosen
and
having
installed
her
among
the
cushions
that
were
to
form
her
couch
i
silenced
decisively
her
renewed
protest
let
me
answer
you
on
this
point
once
and
for
ever
eveena
to
me
this
seems
matter
of
right
not
of
favour
or
fitness
but
favour
and
fitness
here
go
with
right
i
could
no
more
endure
to
place
another
before
or
beside
you
than
i
could
break
the
special
bond
between
us
and
deny
the
hope
of
which
the
serpent
laying
my
hand
on
her
which
by
mere
accident
was
shaped
into
a
faint
resemblance
to
the
mystic
coil
is
the
emblem
the
hope
that
alone
can
make
such
love
as
ours
endurable
or
even
possible
to
creatures
that
must
die
she
who
knelt
with
me
before
the
emerald
throne
who
took
with
me
the
vows
so
awfully
sanctioned
shall
hold
the
first
place
in
my
home
as
in
my
heart
till
the
serpent
promise
be
fulfilled
both
were
silent
for
some
time
for
never
could
we
refer
to
that
vision
whether
an
objective
fact
or
an
impression
communicated
from
one
spirit
to
the
other
by
the
occult
force
of
intense
sympathy
save
by
such
allusion
and
the
remembrance
never
failed
to
affect
us
both
with
a
feeling
too
deep
for
words
eveena
spoke
again
i
am
sorry
you
have
so
bound
yourself
perhaps
only
because
you
knew
me
first
and
it
shames
me
to
receive
fresh
proof
of
your
kindness
and
why
my
own
do
not
make
me
feel
she
said
that
though
the
measured
sentences
you
have
taught
me
to
call
scolding
seemed
the
sharpest
of
all
penances
there
is
a
heavier
yet
in
the
silence
which
withholds
forgiveness
what
have
i
yet
to
forgive
madonna
but
eveena
could
read
my
feelings
in
spite
of
my
words
and
knew
that
the
pain
she
had
given
was
too
recent
to
allow
me
to
misconceive
her
penitence
i
to
say
my
interference
it
was
your
right
to
rule
as
you
chose
and
my
meddling
was
a
far
worse
offence
than
eunané
malice
but
it
was
not
you
felt
too
deeply
to
reprove
true
eunané
hurt
me
a
little
but
i
expected
no
such
misjudgment
from
you
by
the
touch
that
proved
your
alarm
i
know
that
i
gave
no
cause
for
it
how
so
she
asked
in
surprise
you
laid
your
hand
instinctively
on
my
arm
the
one
your
people
use
had
i
made
the
slightest
angry
gesture
you
would
have
held
back
my
had
i
deserved
that
eveena
should
think
so
ill
of
me
think
me
capable
of
doing
such
dishonour
to
her
presence
and
to
my
own
roof
which
should
have
protected
an
equal
enemy
from
that
which
you
feared
for
a
helpless
girl
for
what
you
would
have
checked
was
such
a
blow
as
men
deal
to
men
who
can
strike
back
and
the
hand
that
had
given
it
would
have
been
unfit
to
clasp
man
in
friendship
or
woman
in
love
you
yourself
must
have
shrunk
from
its
touch
she
caught
and
held
it
fast
to
her
lips
can
i
forget
that
it
saved
my
life
i
do
understand
you
at
all
but
i
see
that
i
have
frozen
your
heart
i
did
fancy
for
one
moment
you
would
strike
as
passionate
men
and
women
often
do
strike
provoking
girls
perhaps
forgetting
your
own
strength
and
i
knew
you
would
be
miserable
if
you
did
hurt
her
in
that
way
the
next
moment
i
was
ashamed
more
than
you
will
believe
to
have
wronged
you
so
like
every
man
from
the
head
of
a
household
to
the
or
the
camptâ
you
must
rule
by
fear
but
your
wrath
to
cool
and
you
will
hate
to
make
a
girl
cry
as
you
would
hate
to
send
a
criminal
to
the
the
or
the
and
whatever
you
had
done
do
you
fancy
that
i
could
shrink
from
you
i
said
you
weary
of
your
you
must
strike
with
the
hammer
and
if
you
could
do
so
do
you
think
i
should
not
feel
for
your
hand
to
hold
it
to
the
last
hush
eveena
how
can
i
bear
such
words
you
might
forgive
me
for
any
outrage
to
you
i
doubt
your
easily
forgetting
cruelty
to
another
i
have
not
a
heart
like
yours
as
i
never
failed
a
friend
so
i
never
yet
forgave
a
foe
yet
even
i
might
pardon
one
of
those
girls
an
attempt
to
poison
myself
and
in
some
circumstances
i
might
even
learn
to
like
her
better
afterwards
but
i
doubt
if
i
could
ever
touch
again
the
hand
that
had
mixed
the
poison
for
another
though
that
other
were
my
mortal
enemy
chapter
xix
a
complete
establishment
before
i
slept
eveena
had
convinced
me
much
to
my
own
discomfiture
how
very
limited
must
be
any
authority
that
could
be
delegated
to
her
in
such
a
household
there
could
be
no
second
head
or
deputy
and
an
attempt
to
devolve
any
effective
charge
on
her
would
only
involve
her
in
trouble
and
odium
even
at
the
breakfast
spread
as
usual
in
the
centre
of
the
peristyle
she
entreated
that
we
should
present
ourselves
separately
eunané
appeared
to
have
performed
very
dexterously
the
novel
duty
assigned
to
her
the
had
obeyed
her
orders
with
promptitude
and
the
in
bringing
fruit
leaves
and
roots
from
the
outer
garden
had
more
than
verified
all
that
on
a
former
occasion
eveena
had
told
me
of
their
cleverness
and
quick
comprehension
of
instructions
eunané
face
brightened
visibly
as
i
acknowledged
the
neatness
and
the
tempting
appearance
of
the
meal
she
had
set
forth
she
was
yet
more
gratified
by
receiving
charge
for
the
future
of
the
same
duty
and
authority
to
send
as
is
usual
by
an
ambâ
the
order
for
that
principal
part
of
each
day
food
which
is
supplied
by
the
confectioner
by
reserving
for
eveena
the
place
among
the
cushions
immediately
on
my
left
i
made
to
the
assembled
household
the
expected
announcement
that
she
was
to
be
regarded
as
mistress
of
the
house
feminine
punctiliousness
on
points
of
domestic
precedence
strikingly
contrasting
the
unceremonious
character
of
intercourse
among
men
out
of
doors
the
very
ambau
recognise
the
mistress
or
the
favourite
as
dogs
the
master
of
their
earthly
home
the
ladies
were
at
first
shy
and
silent
eunané
only
giving
me
more
than
a
monosyllabic
answer
to
my
remarks
and
even
eunané
never
speaking
save
in
reply
to
me
a
trivial
incident
however
broke
through
this
reserve
and
afforded
me
a
first
taste
of
the
petty
domestic
vexations
in
store
for
me
the
beverage
most
to
my
liking
was
always
the
juice
flavoured
with
roasted
kernels
something
resembling
coffee
in
taste
on
this
occasion
the
and
another
favourite
dish
had
a
taste
so
peculiar
that
i
pushed
both
aside
almost
untouched
on
observing
this
the
rest
enva
leenoo
elfé
and
eiralé
took
occasion
to
criticise
the
articles
in
question
with
such
remarks
and
grimaces
as
children
might
venture
for
the
annoyance
of
an
inexperienced
sister
i
hesitated
to
repress
this
outbreak
as
it
deserved
till
eunané
bitter
mortification
was
evident
in
her
brightening
colour
and
the
doubtful
glance
of
tearful
eyes
then
a
rebuke
such
as
might
have
been
appropriately
addressed
yesterday
to
these
rude
by
their
governess
at
once
silenced
them
as
we
rose
i
asked
eveena
who
with
more
courtesy
than
the
rest
of
us
had
finished
her
portion
is
there
any
justice
in
these
reproaches
i
certainly
do
like
the
carcarâ
but
it
does
not
follow
that
eunané
is
in
fault
the
rest
eunané
included
looked
their
annoyance
at
this
appeal
but
eveena
temper
and
kindness
were
proof
against
petulance
the
carcarâ
is
in
fault
she
said
but
i
do
think
eunané
is
in
learning
cookery
at
school
she
had
her
materials
supplied
to
her
this
time
the
has
probably
given
her
an
unripe
or
overripe
fruit
which
has
spoiled
the
whole
and
do
you
not
know
ripe
from
unripe
fruit
i
inquired
turning
to
eunané
how
should
she
interposed
eveena
i
doubt
if
she
ever
saw
them
growing
how
so
i
asked
of
eunané
it
is
true
she
answered
i
never
went
beyond
the
walls
of
our
playground
till
i
came
here
and
though
there
were
a
few
in
the
inner
gardens
there
were
none
but
shade
trees
among
the
turf
and
concrete
yards
to
which
we
were
confined
i
should
have
known
no
better
observed
eveena
but
being
brought
up
at
home
i
learned
to
know
all
the
plants
in
my
father
grounds
which
were
more
various
i
believe
than
usual
then
i
said
eunané
has
a
new
life
and
a
multitude
of
new
pleasures
before
her
has
this
peristyle
given
you
your
first
sight
of
flowers
beyond
those
in
the
beds
of
your
nursery
and
have
you
never
seen
anything
of
the
world
about
you
never
she
said
and
eveena
excuse
for
me
is
i
believe
perfectly
true
the
carve
must
have
been
stupid
but
i
knew
no
better
well
i
rejoined
you
must
forgive
the
bird
as
we
must
excuse
you
for
spoiling
our
breakfast
i
will
contrive
that
you
shall
know
more
of
fruits
and
flowers
before
long
in
the
meantime
you
will
probably
have
a
different
if
not
a
wider
view
from
this
roof
than
from
that
of
your
nursery
after
all
eunané
girlhood
typical
of
the
whole
life
of
many
martial
women
had
not
i
suppose
been
more
dreary
or
confined
than
that
of
children
in
london
canton
or
calcutta
but
this
incident
reminding
me
how
dreary
and
limited
that
life
was
served
to
excuse
in
my
eyes
the
pettiness
and
poverty
of
the
characters
it
had
produced
a
martial
woman
whole
experience
may
well
be
confined
within
a
few
acres
and
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
she
may
see
no
more
of
the
world
than
can
be
discerned
from
the
roof
of
her
school
or
her
husband
home
eunané
with
the
assistance
of
the
ambau
busied
herself
in
removing
the
remains
of
the
meal
the
other
five
putting
on
their
veils
scampered
up
the
inclined
plane
to
the
roof
much
like
children
released
from
table
or
from
tasks
turning
to
eveena
who
still
remained
beside
me
i
said
get
your
veil
and
come
out
with
me
i
have
not
yet
an
idea
where
we
are
and
scarcely
a
notion
what
the
grounds
are
like
she
followed
me
to
my
apartment
out
of
which
opened
the
one
she
had
chosen
and
as
the
window
closed
behind
us
she
spoke
in
a
tone
of
appeal
do
not
insist
on
my
accompanying
you
as
you
bade
me
always
speak
my
thought
i
had
much
rather
you
would
take
one
of
the
others
you
professed
i
said
to
take
especial
pleasure
in
a
walk
with
me
and
this
time
i
will
be
careful
that
you
are
not
overtired
of
course
i
should
like
it
she
answered
but
it
would
not
be
just
please
let
me
this
time
remain
to
take
my
part
of
the
household
duties
and
make
myself
acquainted
with
the
house
choose
your
companion
among
the
others
whom
you
have
scarcely
noticed
yet
preferring
not
only
eveena
company
but
even
my
own
to
that
of
any
of
the
six
and
feeling
myself
not
a
little
dependent
on
her
guidance
and
explanations
i
remonstrated
but
finding
that
her
sense
of
justice
and
kindness
would
yield
to
nothing
short
of
direct
command
i
gave
way
you
forget
pleasure
i
said
at
last
but
if
you
will
not
go
you
must
at
least
tell
me
which
i
am
to
take
i
will
not
pretend
to
have
a
choice
in
the
matter
well
then
she
answered
i
should
be
glad
to
see
you
take
eunané
she
is
i
think
the
eldest
apparently
the
most
intelligent
and
companionable
and
she
has
had
one
mortification
already
she
hardly
deserved
and
is
much
the
prettiest
i
added
maliciously
but
eveena
was
incapable
of
even
understanding
so
direct
an
appeal
to
feminine
jealousy
i
think
so
she
said
much
the
prettiest
among
us
but
that
will
make
no
difference
under
her
veil
and
must
she
keep
down
her
veil
i
asked
in
our
own
grounds
eveena
laughed
wherever
she
might
be
seen
by
any
man
but
yourself
call
her
then
i
answered
eveena
hesitated
but
having
successfully
carried
her
own
way
on
the
main
question
she
would
not
renew
her
remonstrances
on
a
minor
point
and
finding
her
about
to
join
the
rest
she
drew
eunané
apart
eunané
came
up
to
me
alone
eveena
having
busied
herself
in
some
other
part
of
the
house
she
approached
slowly
as
if
reluctant
and
stood
silent
before
me
her
manner
by
no
means
expressive
of
satisfaction
eveena
thought
i
said
that
you
would
like
to
accompany
me
but
if
not
you
may
tell
her
so
and
tell
her
in
that
case
that
she
come
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
wherever
you
please
replied
eunané
eveena
did
not
tell
me
why
you
sent
for
me
and
and
you
were
afraid
to
be
scolded
for
spoiling
the
breakfast
you
have
heard
quite
enough
of
that
you
dropped
a
word
last
night
she
answered
which
made
me
think
you
would
keep
your
displeasure
till
you
had
me
alone
quite
true
i
said
if
i
had
any
displeasure
to
keep
but
you
might
spoil
a
dozen
meals
and
not
vex
me
half
as
much
as
the
others
did
why
she
asked
in
surprise
girls
and
women
always
spite
one
another
if
they
have
a
chance
especially
one
who
is
in
disfavour
or
disgrace
with
authority
so
much
the
worse
i
answered
and
now
you
know
as
much
or
as
little
of
the
house
as
any
of
us
find
the
way
into
the
grounds
a
narrow
door
not
of
crystal
as
usual
but
of
metal
painted
to
resemble
the
walls
led
directly
from
one
corner
of
the
peristyle
into
the
grounds
outside
i
had
inferred
on
my
arrival
by
the
distance
from
the
road
to
the
house
that
their
extent
was
considerable
but
i
was
surprised
alike
by
their
size
and
arrangement
on
two
sides
they
were
bounded
by
a
wall
about
four
hundred
yards
in
length
that
parting
them
from
the
road
was
about
twice
as
long
they
were
laid
out
with
few
of
the
usual
orchard
plots
and
beds
of
different
fruits
and
vegetables
but
rather
in
the
form
of
a
small
park
with
trees
of
various
sorts
among
which
the
fruit
trees
were
a
minority
the
surface
was
broken
by
natural
rising
grounds
and
artificial
terraces
the
soil
was
turfed
in
the
manner
i
have
previously
described
with
minute
plants
of
different
colours
arranged
in
bands
and
patterns
here
and
there
was
a
garden
consisting
of
a
variety
of
and
flowering
shrubs
broad
concrete
paths
winding
throughout
and
a
beautiful
silver
stream
meandering
hither
and
thither
and
filling
several
small
ponds
and
fountains
that
the
grounds
immediately
appertaining
to
the
house
were
not
intended
as
usual
for
the
purposes
of
a
farm
or
was
evident
the
reason
became
equally
apparent
when
looking
towards
the
north
where
no
wall
bounded
them
i
saw
over
a
gate
in
the
middle
of
a
dense
hedge
of
flowering
shrubs
which
with
a
ditch
beyond
it
formed
the
limit
of
the
park
in
that
direction
an
extensive
farm
divided
by
the
usual
ditches
into
some
or
thirty
distinct
fields
and
more
than
a
square
mile
in
extent
this
as
eunané
native
inquisitiveness
and
quickness
had
already
learnt
formed
part
of
the
estate
attached
to
the
mansion
and
bestowed
upon
me
by
the
camptâ
it
was
admirably
cultivated
containing
orchards
fields
rich
with
various
thriving
crops
and
pastures
grazed
by
the
unicorn
and
other
of
the
domestic
birds
and
beasts
kept
to
supply
martial
tables
with
milk
eggs
and
meat
producing
nearly
every
commodity
to
which
the
climate
was
suited
and
as
a
very
short
observation
assured
me
capable
of
yielding
a
far
greater
income
than
would
suffice
to
sustain
in
luxury
and
splendour
a
household
larger
than
that
enforced
upon
me
we
walked
in
this
direction
my
companion
talking
fluently
enough
when
once
i
had
set
her
at
ease
and
seemingly
free
from
the
shyness
and
timidity
which
eveena
had
at
first
displayed
she
paused
when
we
reached
a
bridge
that
spanned
the
ditch
dividing
the
grounds
from
the
farm
aware
that
save
on
special
invitation
she
might
not
even
in
my
company
go
beyond
the
former
i
led
her
on
however
till
soon
after
we
had
crossed
the
ditch
i
saw
a
man
approaching
us
on
this
i
desired
eunané
to
remain
where
she
was
seating
her
at
the
foot
of
a
fruit
tree
in
one
of
the
orchard
plots
and
proceeded
to
meet
the
stranger
after
exchanging
the
usual
salute
he
came
immediately
to
the
point
i
thought
he
said
that
you
would
not
care
yourself
to
undertake
the
cultivation
of
so
extensive
an
estate
indeed
the
mere
superintendence
would
occupy
the
whole
of
one
man
attention
and
its
proper
cultivation
would
be
the
work
of
six
or
eight
i
have
had
some
little
experience
in
agriculture
and
determined
to
ask
for
this
charge
and
who
has
recommended
you
i
said
or
have
you
any
sort
of
introduction
or
credentials
to
me
he
made
a
sign
which
i
immediately
recognised
caution
however
was
imposed
by
the
law
to
which
that
sign
appealed
you
can
read
i
said
by
starlight
better
than
by
any
other
he
rejoined
with
a
smile
one
or
two
more
tokens
interchanged
left
me
no
doubt
that
the
claim
was
genuine
and
of
course
irresistible
enough
i
replied
you
may
take
entire
charge
on
the
usual
terms
which
doubtless
you
know
better
than
i
you
trust
me
then
absolutely
he
said
in
a
tone
of
some
little
surprise
in
trusting
you
i
replied
i
trust
the
zinta
i
am
tolerably
sure
to
be
safe
in
hands
recommended
by
them
you
are
right
he
said
and
how
right
this
will
prove
to
you
and
he
placed
in
my
hand
a
small
cake
upon
which
was
stamped
an
impression
of
the
signet
that
i
had
seen
on
esmo
wrist
when
he
saw
that
i
recognised
it
he
took
it
back
and
breaking
it
into
fragments
chewed
and
swallowed
it
this
he
said
was
given
me
to
avouch
the
following
message
our
chiefs
are
informed
that
the
order
is
threatened
with
a
novel
danger
systematic
persecution
by
open
force
or
by
law
has
been
attempted
and
defeated
ages
ago
and
will
hardly
be
tried
again
what
seems
to
be
intended
now
is
the
destruction
of
our
chiefs
individually
by
secret
means
means
which
it
is
supposed
we
shall
not
be
able
to
trace
to
the
instigators
even
if
we
should
detect
their
instruments
but
i
remarked
those
who
have
warned
you
of
the
danger
must
know
from
whom
it
proceeds
and
those
who
are
employed
in
such
an
attack
must
run
not
only
the
ordinary
risk
of
assassins
but
the
further
risk
entailed
by
the
peculiar
powers
of
those
they
assail
those
powers
he
answered
they
do
not
understand
or
recognise
the
instruments
i
presume
will
be
encouraged
by
an
assurance
that
the
courts
are
in
their
favour
and
by
a
pledge
in
the
last
resort
that
they
shall
be
protected
the
exceptional
customs
of
our
order
especially
their
refusal
to
send
their
children
into
the
public
nurseries
mark
out
and
identify
them
and
though
our
places
of
meeting
are
concealed
and
have
never
been
invaded
the
fact
that
we
do
meet
and
the
persons
of
those
who
attend
can
hardly
be
concealed
but
i
asked
if
a
charge
of
assassination
is
once
made
and
proved
how
can
the
courts
refuse
to
do
justice
can
the
instigators
protect
the
culprit
without
committing
themselves
they
would
appeal
i
do
not
doubt
to
a
law
passed
many
ages
ago
with
a
special
regard
to
ourselves
but
which
has
not
been
applied
for
a
score
of
centuries
putting
the
members
of
a
secret
religious
society
beyond
the
pale
of
legal
protection
that
we
shall
ultimately
find
them
out
and
avenge
ourselves
you
need
not
doubt
but
in
the
meantime
every
known
dissentient
from
the
customs
of
the
majority
is
in
danger
and
persons
of
note
or
prominence
especially
so
next
to
esmo
and
his
son
the
husband
of
his
daughter
is
perhaps
in
as
much
peril
as
any
one
no
open
attempt
on
your
life
will
be
adventured
at
present
while
you
retain
the
favour
of
the
camptâ
but
you
have
made
at
least
one
mortal
and
powerful
enemy
and
you
may
possibly
be
the
object
of
and
persistent
schemes
of
assassination
on
the
other
hand
next
to
our
chief
and
his
son
you
have
a
paramount
claim
on
the
protection
of
the
order
and
those
who
with
me
will
take
charge
of
your
affairs
have
also
charge
to
watch
vigilantly
over
your
life
if
you
will
trust
me
beforehand
with
knowledge
of
all
your
movements
i
think
your
chief
peril
will
lie
in
the
one
sphere
upon
which
we
can
not
intrude
your
own
household
and
clavelta
directs
your
own
special
attention
to
this
quarter
immediate
danger
can
scarcely
threaten
you
as
yet
save
from
a
woman
hand
poison
probably
he
returned
coolly
but
of
the
details
of
the
plot
our
council
are
i
believe
as
absolutely
ignorant
as
of
the
quarter
from
which
it
proceeds
and
how
i
inquired
can
it
be
that
the
witness
who
has
informed
you
of
the
plot
has
withheld
the
names
without
which
his
information
is
so
imperfect
and
serves
rather
to
alarm
than
to
protect
us
you
know
he
replied
the
kind
of
mysterious
perception
to
which
we
can
resort
and
are
probably
aware
how
strangely
lucid
in
some
points
how
strangely
darkened
in
others
is
the
vision
that
does
not
depend
on
ordinary
human
senses
as
we
spoke
we
had
passed
eunané
once
or
twice
walking
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
path
near
which
she
sat
as
my
companion
was
about
to
continue
we
were
so
certainly
within
her
hearing
that
i
checked
him
take
care
i
said
i
know
nothing
of
her
except
the
choice
and
that
she
is
not
of
us
he
visibly
started
i
thought
he
said
that
the
witness
of
our
conversation
was
one
at
least
as
reliable
as
yourself
i
forgot
how
it
happened
that
you
have
diverged
from
the
prudence
which
forbids
our
brethren
to
admit
to
their
households
aliens
from
the
order
and
possible
spies
on
its
secrets
of
whom
do
you
speak
as
clavelta
i
asked
i
was
not
even
aware
that
the
order
had
a
single
head
the
signet
replied
my
friend
in
evident
surprise
should
have
distinguished
the
to
duller
sight
than
yours
we
had
not
spoken
of
course
till
we
were
again
beyond
hearing
but
my
companion
looked
round
carefully
before
he
proceeded
you
will
understand
the
better
then
how
strong
is
your
own
claim
upon
the
care
of
your
brethren
and
how
confidently
you
may
rely
upon
their
vigilance
and
fidelity
i
should
regret
i
answered
that
their
lives
should
be
risked
for
mine
in
dangers
like
those
against
which
you
could
protect
me
i
have
been
accustomed
from
boyhood
to
trust
my
own
right
hand
but
the
fear
of
secret
assassination
has
often
unnerved
the
bravest
men
and
i
will
not
say
that
it
may
not
disturb
me
for
you
he
answered
personally
we
should
care
as
for
one
of
our
brethren
exposed
to
especial
danger
for
him
who
saved
the
descendant
of
our
founder
and
who
in
her
right
after
her
father
and
brother
would
be
the
guardian
if
not
the
head
of
the
only
remaining
family
of
his
lineage
one
and
all
of
us
are
at
need
bound
to
die
after
a
few
more
words
we
parted
and
i
rejoined
eunané
and
led
her
back
towards
the
house
i
had
learnt
to
consider
taciturnity
a
matter
of
course
except
where
there
was
actual
occasion
for
speech
but
eunané
had
chattered
so
fluently
and
frankly
just
before
that
her
absolute
silence
might
have
suggested
to
me
the
possibility
that
she
had
heard
and
was
pondering
things
not
intended
for
her
knowledge
had
i
been
less
preoccupied
enured
to
the
perils
of
war
of
the
chase
of
eastern
diplomacy
and
of
travel
in
the
wildest
parts
of
the
earth
i
do
not
pretend
indifference
to
the
fear
of
assassination
and
especially
of
poison
cromwell
and
other
soldiers
of
equal
nerve
and
clearer
conscience
have
found
their
iron
courage
sorely
shaken
by
a
peril
against
which
no
precautions
were
effective
and
from
which
they
could
not
enjoy
an
hour
security
the
incessant
continuous
strain
on
the
nerves
is
i
suppose
the
chief
element
in
the
peculiar
dread
with
which
brave
men
have
regarded
this
kind
of
peril
as
the
best
troops
can
not
endure
to
be
under
fire
in
their
camp
weighing
however
the
probability
that
girls
who
had
been
selected
by
the
sovereign
and
had
left
their
nursery
only
to
pass
directly
into
my
house
could
have
been
already
bribed
or
seduced
to
become
the
instruments
of
murderous
treachery
i
found
it
but
slight
and
before
we
reached
the
house
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
discard
the
apprehensions
or
precautions
recommended
to
me
on
their
account
far
better
if
need
be
to
die
by
poison
than
to
live
in
hourly
terror
of
it
better
to
be
murdered
than
to
suspect
of
secret
treason
those
with
whom
i
must
maintain
the
most
intimate
relations
and
whose
sex
and
years
made
it
intolerable
to
believe
them
criminal
i
dismissed
the
thought
then
and
believing
that
i
had
probably
wronged
them
in
allowing
it
to
dwell
for
a
moment
in
my
mind
i
felt
perhaps
more
tenderly
than
before
towards
them
and
certainly
indisposed
to
name
to
eveena
a
suspicion
of
which
i
was
myself
ashamed
perhaps
too
youth
and
beauty
weighed
in
my
conclusion
more
than
cool
reason
would
have
allowed
a
martial
proverb
says
trust
a
foe
and
you
may
rue
it
trust
a
friend
and
perish
through
it
trust
a
woman
if
you
will
thrice
betrayed
you
trust
her
still
as
to
the
general
warning
i
was
wishful
to
consult
eveena
and
unwilling
to
withhold
from
her
any
secret
of
my
thoughts
but
equally
averse
to
disturb
her
with
alarms
that
were
trying
even
to
nerves
seasoned
by
the
varied
experience
of
twenty
years
against
every
open
peril
chapter
xx
life
social
and
domestic
as
we
approached
the
house
i
caught
sight
of
eveena
figure
among
the
party
gathered
on
the
roof
she
had
witnessed
the
interview
but
her
habitual
and
conscientious
deference
forbade
her
to
ask
a
confidence
not
volunteered
and
she
seemed
fully
satisfied
when
on
the
first
occasion
on
which
we
were
alone
i
told
her
simply
that
the
stranger
belonged
to
the
zinta
and
had
been
recommended
by
her
father
himself
to
the
charge
of
my
estate
though
reluctant
to
disturb
her
mind
with
fears
she
could
not
shake
off
as
i
could
and
which
would
make
my
every
absence
at
least
a
season
of
terror
the
sense
of
insecurity
doubtless
rendered
me
more
anxious
to
enjoy
whenever
possible
the
only
society
in
which
it
was
permissible
to
be
frank
and
off
my
guard
no
man
in
his
senses
would
voluntarily
have
accepted
the
position
which
had
been
forced
upon
me
the
zveltau

aliens
into
their
households
their
leading
ideas
and
fundamental
principles

the
conduct
of
existence
the
motives
of
action
the
bases
of
all
moral
reasoning

completely

the
inferences
drawn
from
them
and
the
habits
of
thought
to
which
they
lead
pervade
and
tinge
the
mind
conscience
and
even
language
that
though
it
may
be
easy
to
live
in
the
light
at
home
and
walk
with
the
blind
abroad
yet
in
the
familiar
intercourse
of
household
life
even

and
reserved
man

and

him
or

translating
different
thoughts
into
an
alien
language

the
key

the
mystery
the
danger
in
which
my
relation
to
the
zinta
and
its
chief
involved
me
and
the
presence
of
half
a
dozen
rivals
to
eveena
rivals
also
to
that
regard
for
the
star
which
at
first
i
felt
chiefly
for
her
sake
likely
as
they
seemed
to
impair
the
strength
and
sweetness
of
the
tie
between
us
actually
worked
to
consolidate
and
endear
it
to
enjoy
except
on
set
occasions
without
constant
liability
to
interruption
eveena
sole
society
was
no
easy
matter
to
conceal
our
real
secret
and
the
fact
that
there
was
a
secret
was
imperative
avowedly
exclusive
confidence
conferences
from
which
the
rest
of
the
household
were
directly
shut
out
would
have
suggested
to
their
envious
tempers
that
eveena
played
the
spy
on
them
or
influenced
and
advised
the
exercise
of
my
authority
to
be
alone
with
her
therefore
as
naturally
and
necessarily
i
must
often
wish
to
be
required
manoeuvres
and
arrangements
as
delicate
and
difficult
though
as
innocent
as
those
employed
by
engaged
couples
under
the
strict
conventions
of
european
household
usage
and
the
comparative
rarity
of
such
interviews
and
the
manner
in
which
they
had
often
to
be
contrived
beforehand
kept
alive
in
its
earliest
freshness
the
love
which
if
not
really
diminished
generally
loses
somewhat
of
its
first
bloom
and
delicacy
in
the
unrestrained
intercourse
of
marriage
absolutely
and
solely
trusted
assured
that
her
company
was
eagerly
sought
and
at
least
as
deeply
valued
as
ever
compelled
by
the
ideas
of
her
race
to
accept
the
situation
as
natural
and
right
and
wholly
incapable
of
the
pettier
and
meaner
forms
of
jealousy
eveena
was
fully
content
and
happy
in
her
relations
with
me
that
on
the
whole
she
was
not
comfortable
or
at
least
much
less
so
than
during
our
suddenly
abbreviated
honeymoon
was
apparent
but
her
loss
of
brightness
and
cheerfulness
was
visible
chiefly
in
her
weary
and
downcast
looks
on
any
occasion
when
after
being
absent
for
some
hours
from
the
house
i
came
upon
her
unawares
in
my
presence
she
was
always
calm
and
peaceful
kind
and
seemingly
at
ease
and
if
she
saw
or
heard
me
on
my
return
though
she
carefully
avoided
any
appearance
of
eagerness
to
greet
me
sooner
than
others
or
to
claim
especial
attention
she
ever
met
me
with
a
smile
of
welcome
as
frank
and
bright
as
a
young
bride
on
earth
could
give
to
a
husband
returning
to
her
sole
society
from
a
long
day
of
labour
for
her
sake
in
so
far
as
compliance
was
possible
i
was
compelled
to
admit
the
wisdom
of
eveena
plea
that
no
open
distinction
should
be
made
in
her
favour
except
in
the
simple
fact
of
our
affection
there
was
no
assignable
reason
for
making
her
my
companion
more
frequently
than
eunané
or
eivé
except
that
i
could
trust
her
completely
there
was
no
distinction
of
age
social
rank
or
domestic
relation
to
afford
a
pretext
for
exempting
her
from
restraints
which
if
at
first
i
thought
them
senseless
and
severe
were
soon
justified
by
experience
of
the
kind
of
domestic
control
which
just
emancipated
expected
and
required
nor
would
she
accept
the
immunity
tacitly
allowed
her
it
was
not
that
any
established
custom
or
right
bounded
the
arbitrary
power
of
domestic
autocracy
the
right
of
all
but
unbounded
wrong
the
liberty
of
limitless
caprice
is
unquestionably
vested
in
the
head
of
the
household
but
the
very
completeness
of
the
despotism
rendered
its
exercise
impossible
force
can
not
act
where
there
is
no
resistance
the
sword
of
the
plantagenet
could
cleave
the
helmet
but
not
the
quilt
of
down
i
could
do
as
i
pleased
without
infringing
any
understanding
or
giving
any
right
to
complain
but
said
eveena
you
have
a
sense
of
justice
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
law
or
usage
even
your
language
is
not
ours
you
think
of
right
and
wrong
where
we
should
speak
only
of
what
is
or
is
not
punishable
you
can
make
a
favourite
if
you
will
pay
the
price
could
you
endure
to
be
hated
in
your
own
home
or
i
to
know
that
you
deserved
it
or
if
you
could
could
you
bear
to
see
me
hated
and
my
life
made
miserable
they
dare
not
i
returned
angrily
fearing
that
they
had
dared
and
that
she
had
already
felt
the
spite
she
was
so
careful
not
to
provoke
do
you
think
that
feminine
malice
can
not
contrive
to
envenom
a
dozen
stings
that
i
could
not
explain
if
i
would
and
you
could
not
deal
with
if
i
did
but
i
replied
it
seems
admitted
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
right
or
custom
as
enva
said
i
have
bought
and
paid
for
them
and
may
do
what
i
please
within
the
contract
and
you
agree
that
is
just
what
any
other
man
in
this
world
would
do
yes
returned
eveena
and
i
watched
your
face
while
enva
spoke
how
did
you
like
her
doctrine
of
course
you
may
do
as
you
please
if
you
can
please
you
may
silence
discontent
you
may
suppress
spiteful
innuendos
and
even
sulky
looks
you
may
put
down
mutiny
by
sheer
terror
can
you
you
may
command
me
to
go
with
you
whenever
you
go
out
you
may
take
the
same
means
to
make
me
complain
of
unkindness
as
to
make
them
conceal
it
you
may
act
like
one
of
our
own
people
if
you
can
stoop
to
the
level
of
their
minds
but
we
both
know
that
you
can
do
nothing
of
the
kind
how
could
you
bear
to
be
driven
into
unsparing
and
undeserved
severity
who
can
hardly
bring
yourself
to
enforce
the
discipline
necessary
to
peace
and
comfort
on
those
who
will
only
be
ruled
by
fear
and
would
like
you
better
if
they
feared
you
more
did
you
hear
the
proverb
leenoo
muttered
very
unjustly
when
she
left
your
room
yesterday
favourite
wears
out
many
sandals
no
you
see
the
very
phrase
wounds
and
disgusts
you
but
you
would
find
it
a
true
one
can
you
take
vengeance
for
a
fault
you
have
yourself
provoked
can
you
decide
without
inquiry
condemn
without
evidence
punish
without
hearing
men
do
these
things
of
course
and
women
expect
them
but
you
i
do
not
say
you
would
be
ashamed
so
to
act
you
can
not
do
it
any
more
than
you
can
breathe
the
air
of
our
at
all
events
eveena
i
no
more
dare
do
it
in
your
presence
than
i
dare
forswear
the
faith
we
hold
in
common
but
whatever
eveena
might
exact
or
i
concede
the
distinction
between
the
wife
who
commanded
as
much
respect
as
affection
and
the
girls
who
could
at
best
be
pets
or
playthings
was
apparent
against
our
will
in
every
detail
of
daily
life
and
domestic
intercourse
it
was
alike
impossible
to
treat
eveena
as
a
child
and
to
rule
enva
or
eiralé
as
other
than
children
it
was
as
unnatural
to
use
the
tone
of
command
or
rebuke
to
one
for
whom
my
unexpressed
wishes
were
absolute
law
as
to
observe
the
form
of
request
or
advice
in
directing
or
reproving
those
whose
obedience
depended
on
the
consequences
of
rebellion
it
only
made
matters
worse
that
the
distinction
corresponded
but
too
accurately
to
their
several
deserts
no
faults
could
have
been
so
irritating
to
eveena
companions
as
her
undeniable
faultlessness
the
ludicrous
aspect
of
my
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
household
was
even
more
striking
than
i
had
expected
that
i
should
find
myself
in
the
absurd
position
of
a
man
entrusted
with
the
direct
personal
government
of
young
ladies
was
even
more
truly
spoke
than
meant
one
at
least
among
them
might
singly
have
made
in
time
a
not
unlovable
wife
and
all
perhaps
might
severally
and
separately
have
been
reduced
to
conjugal
complaisance
collectively
they
were
as
eveena
had
said
a
set
of
and
used
to
stricter
restraint
and
much
sharper
discipline
than
those
of
a
french
or
italian
convent
they
would
have
made
life
a
burden
to
a
vigorous
english
schoolmistress
and
imperilled
the
soul
of
any
whose
list
of
permissible
penances
excluded
the
dark
cell
and
the
scourge
fortunately
for
both
parties
i
had
the
advantage
of
governess
and
superior
in
the
natural
awe
which
girls
feel
for
the
authority
of
manhood
till
they
have
found
out
of
what
soft
fibre
men
are
made
and
in
the
artificial
fear
inspired
by
domestic
usage
and
tradition
for
i
was
soon
aware
that
even
on
its
ridiculous
side
the
relation
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
the
simple
indifference
a
man
feels
towards
the
escapades
of
girlhood
was
not
applicable
to
women
and
wives
who
yet
lacked
womanly
sense
and
the
feeling
of
conjugal
duty
this
serious
aspect
of
their
position
soon
contracted
the
indulgence
naturally
conceded
to
youth
heedlessness
and
animal
spirits
these
displayed
at
first
only
in
the
energy
and
eagerness
of
their
every
movement
within
the
narrow
limits
of
conventional
usage
broke
all
bounds
when
after
one
or
two
experiments
on
my
patience
they
felt
that
they
had
at
least
for
the
moment
exchanged
the
monotony
the
mechanical
routine
the
stern
repression
of
their
life
in
the
great
nurseries
not
for
the
harsh
household
discipline
to
which
they
naturally
looked
forward
but
for
the
loosened
zone
which
to
them
seemed
to
promise
absolute
liberty
when
not
immediately
in
my
presence
or
eveena
their
keen
enjoyment
of
a
life
so
new
the
sudden
development
of
the
brighter
side
of
their
nature
under
circumstances
that
gave
play
to
the
vigorous
vitality
of
youth
gave
as
much
pleasure
to
me
as
to
themselves
but
in
contact
with
myself
or
eveena
they
were
women
and
showed
only
the
wrong
side
of
the
varied
texture
of
womanhood
to
the
master
they
were
slaves
each
anxious
to
attract
his
notice
win
his
preference
before
the
favourite
spiteful
envious
of
her
and
of
each
other
bitter
malicious
and
false
for
eveena
sake
it
was
impossible
to
look
on
with
indolent
indifference
on
freaks
of
temper
which
childish
in
the
form
they
assumed
were
envenomed
by
the
deliberate
dislike
and
unscrupulous
cunning
of
jealous
women
but
even
on
the
childish
side
of
their
character
and
conduct
they
soon
displayed
a
determination
to
test
by
actual
experiment
the
utmost
extent
of
the
liberty
allowed
and
the
nature
and
sufficiency
of
its
limits
eunané
was
always
the
most
audacious
trespasser
and
representative
rebel
fortunately
for
her
the
daring
which
had
bewildered
and
exasperated
feminine
guardians
rather
amused
and
interested
me
giving
some
variety
and
relief
to
the
monotonous
absurdity
of
the
situation
nothing
in
her
conduct
was
more
remarkable
or
more
characteristic
than
the
simplicity
and
good
temper
with
which
she
generally
accepted
as
of
course
the
less
agreeable
consequences
of
her
outbreaks
unless
it
were
the
sort
of
natural
dignity
with
which
when
she
so
pleased
the
game
played
out
and
its
forfeit
paid
the
naughty
child
subsided
into
the
lively
but
rational
companion
and
the
woman
simply
ignored
the
scrapes
of
the
as
her
character
seemed
to
unfold
eivé
individuality
became
as
distinctly
parted
from
the
rest
as
eunané
though
in
an
opposite
direction
comparatively
timid
and
indolent
without
their
fulness
of
life
she
seemed
to
me
little
more
than
a
child
and
she
fell
with
apparent
willingness
into
that
position
accepting
naturally
its
privileges
and
exemptions
she
alone
was
never
in
the
way
never
vexatious
or
exacting
content
with
the
notice
that
naturally
fell
to
her
share
she
obtained
the
more
never
intruding
between
eveena
and
myself
she
alone
was
not
wholly
unwelcome
to
share
our
accidental
privacy
when
in
the
peristyle
or
the
grounds
the
others
left
us
temporarily
alone
on
such
occasions
she
would
often
draw
near
and
crouch
at
my
feet
or
by
eveena
side
curling
herself
like
a
kitten
upon
the
turf
or
among
the
cushions
often
resting
her
little
head
upon
eveena
knee
or
mine
generally
silent
but
never
so
silent
as
to
seem
to
be
a
spy
upon
our
conversation
rather
as
a
favourite
child
privileged
in
consideration
of
her
quietude
and
her
supposed
harmlessness
and
inattention
to
remain
when
others
are
excluded
and
to
hear
much
to
which
she
is
supposed
not
to
listen
having
no
special
duties
of
her
own
in
the
household
she
would
wait
upon
and
assist
eveena
whenever
the
latter
would
accept
her
attendance
when
the
whole
party
were
assembled
it
was
her
wont
to
choose
her
place
not
in
the
circle
still
less
at
my
side
eveena
title
to
the
post
of
honour
on
the
left
being
uncontested
and
eunané
generally
occupying
the
cushions
on
my
right
but
eivé
lying
at
our
feet
would
support
herself
on
her
arm
between
my
knee
and
eunané
content
to
attract
my
hand
to
play
with
her
curls
or
stroke
her
head
under
such
encouragement
she
would
creep
on
to
my
lap
and
rest
there
but
seldom
took
any
part
in
conversation
satisfied
with
the
attention
one
pays
to
a
child
a
word
that
dropped
from
enva
however
on
one
occasion
obliged
me
to
observe
that
it
was
in
eveena
absence
that
eivé
always
seemed
most
fully
aware
of
her
privileges
and
most
lavish
of
her
childlike
caresses
the
kind
of
notice
and
affection
she
obtained
did
not
provoke
the
envy
even
of
leenoo
or
eiralé
she
no
more
affected
to
imitate
eveena
absolute
devotion
than
she
ventured
on
eunané
reckless
petulance
she
kept
my
interest
alive
by
the
faults
of
a
spoiled
child
her
freaks
were
always
such
as
to
demand
immediate
repression
without
provoking
serious
displeasure
so
that
the
temporary
disgrace
cost
her
little
and
the
subsequent
reconciliation
strengthened
her
hold
on
my
heart
but
with
eveena
or
in
her
presence
eivé
waywardness
was
so
suppressed
or
controlled
that
eveena
perceptible
coolness
towards
her
it
was
never
coldness
or
unkindness
somewhat
surprised
me
few
martialists
when
wealthy
enough
to
hand
over
the
management
of
their
property
to
others
care
to
interfere
or
even
to
watch
its
cultivation
this
however
to
me
was
a
subject
of
as
much
interest
as
any
other
of
the
many
peculiarities
of
martial
society
commerce
and
industry
which
it
concerned
me
to
investigate
and
understand
and
when
not
otherwise
employed
i
spent
great
part
of
my
day
in
watching
and
now
and
then
directing
the
work
that
went
on
during
the
whole
of
the
sunlight
and
not
unfrequently
during
the
night
upon
my
farm
davilo
the
superintendent
had
engaged
no
fewer
than
eight
subordinates
who
with
the
assistance
of
the
ambau
the
carvee
and
the
electric
machines
kept
every
portion
of
the
ground
in
the
most
perfect
state
of
culture
the
most
valuable
part
of
the
produce
consisted
of
those
farinaceous
fruits
growing
on
trees
from
twenty
to
eighty
feet
in
height
which
form
the
principal
element
of
martial
food
between
the
tropics
these
trees
yield
ripe
fruit
twice
a
year
during
a
total
period
of
about
three
of
our
months
perhaps
for
a
hundred
days
various
gourds
growing
chiefly
on
canes
hanging
from
long
flexile
stalks
that
spring
from
the
top
of
the
stem
at
a
height
of
from
three
to
eight
feet
yield
juice
which
is
employed
partly
in
flavouring
the
various
loaves
and
cakes
into
which
the
flour
is
made
partly
in
the
numerous
beverages
never
allowed
to
ferment
and
consequently
requiring
to
be
made
fresh
every
day
of
which
the
smallest
martial
household
has
a
greater
variety
than
the
most
luxurious
palace
of
the
east
the
best
are
made
from
fruits
whose
whole
pulp
is
liquified
by
piercing
the
rind
before
the
fruit
is
fully
ripe
and
closing
the
orifice
with
a
substance
almost
exactly
according
to
a
practice
common
in
different
parts
of
asia
the
drinks
are
made
of
course
at
home
the
farinaceous
fruits
are
sold
to
the
confectioners
who
take
also
a
portion
of
the
milk
and
all
the
meat
supplied
by
the
pastures
many
choice
fruits
grow
on
shrubs
ranging
from
the
size
of
a
large
black
currant
tree
to
that
of
the
smallest
gooseberry
bush
vines
growing
along
the
ground
bear
clustering
nuts
whose
kernels
are
sometimes
as
hard
as
that
of
a
sometimes
almost
as
soft
as
butter
the
latter
with
the
juicy
fruits
are
preserved
if
necessary
for
a
whole
year
in
storehouses
dug
in
the
ground
and
lined
with
concrete
in
which
by
chemical
means
a
temperature
a
little
above
the
is
steadily
maintained
at
very
trivial
cost
the
number
of
dishes
producible
by
the
mixture
of
these
various
materials
with
the
occasional
addition
of
meat
fish
and
eggs
is
enormous
and
it
is
only
when
some
particular
compound
is
in
special
favour
with
the
master
of
the
house
that
it
makes
its
appearance
more
than
perhaps
once
in
ten
days
upon
the
same
table
the
invention
of
the
confectioners
is
exquisite
and
inexhaustible
and
every
table
is
supplied
with
a
variety
of
dainties
sufficient
for
a
feast
in
the
most
hospitable
and
wealthy
household
of
europe
many
of
the
smaller
and
shrubs
yield
two
crops
in
the
year
the
vegetables
crisper
and
of
much
more
varied
taste
than
the
best
terrestrial
salads
sometimes
possessing
a
flavour
as
as
that
of
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
are
gathered
continuously
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
the
vines
tough
and
fibrous
supply
the
best
and
strongest
cordage
used
in
mars
for
this
purpose
they
are
dried
stripped
combed
and
put
through
an
elaborate
process
of
manufacture
which
without
weakening
the
fibres
renders
them
smooth
and
removes
the
knots
in
which
they
naturally
abound
the
twisted
cord
of
the
is
almost
as
strong
as
a
metallic
wire
rope
of
half
its
measurement
there
is
another
purpose
for
which
these
fibres
in
their
natural
state
are
employed
simply
dried
and
twisted
they
form
a
scourge
as
terrible
as
the
russian
knout
or
african
cowhide
though
of
a
different
character
a
scourge
which
even
in
its
lightest
form
reduces
the
wildest
herd
to
instant
order
and
which
as
employed
on
criminals
is
hardly
less
dreaded
than
that
electric
rack
whereby
martial
science
inflicts
on
every
nerve
a
graduated
torture
such
as
even
ecclesiastical
malignity
has
not
invented
on
earth
such
as
i
certainly
will
not
place
in
the
hands
of
terrestrial
rulers
all
these
crops
are
raised
with
marvellously
little
human
labour
the
whole
work
of
ploughing
and
sowing
being
done
by
machinery
that
of
weeding
and
harvesting
chiefly
by
the
carvee
the
ambau
climb
the
trees
and
pick
the
fruit
from
the
ends
of
the
branches
which
they
are
also
taught
to
pinch
in
so
that
none
grow
so
long
as
to
break
with
the
weight
of
these
creatures
as
clever
and
agile
as
the
smaller
monkeys
but
almost
as
large
as
an
ordinary
baboon
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
size
for
size
and
paribus
all
bodies
animate
and
inanimate
on
mars
weigh
less
than
half
as
much
as
they
would
on
earth
eunané
blunder
about
the
was
not
explained
by
any
subsequent
errors
of
the
ambau
or
carvee
which
always
selected
the
ripe
fruit
with
faultless
skill
leaving
the
immature
untouched
and
throwing
aside
in
small
heaps
to
manure
the
ground
the
few
that
had
been
allowed
to
grow
too
ripe
for
use
the
sums
paid
from
time
to
time
into
my
hands
received
from
the
sales
of
produce
were
far
greater
than
i
could
possibly
spend
in
gratifying
any
taste
of
my
own
and
as
i
presently
found
the
idea
that
the
surplus
might
indulge
those
of
the
ladies
never
entered
their
minds
before
we
had
been
settled
in
our
home
for
three
days
eveena
had
made
two
requests
which
i
was
well
pleased
to
grant
first
she
entreated
that
i
would
teach
her
one
at
least
of
the
languages
with
which
i
was
familiar
a
task
of
whose
extreme
difficulty
she
had
little
idea
compared
with
her
native
tongue
the
complication
and
irregularities
of
the
simplest
language
spoken
on
earth
are
far
more
arbitrary
and
provoking
than
seems
the
most
difficult
of
ancient
or
oriental
tongues
to
a
frenchman
or
italian
in
order
to
fulfil
my
promise
that
she
should
assist
me
in
recording
my
observations
and
writing
out
my
notes
i
chose
latin
unhappily
for
her
i
found
myself
as
impatient
and
unsuccessful
as
i
was
inexperienced
in
teaching
and
nothing
but
her
exquisite
gentleness
and
forbearance
could
have
made
the
lessons
otherwise
than
painful
to
us
both
well
for
me
that
the
right
to
govern
wrong
was
to
her
a
simple
truth
an
inalienable
marital
privilege
to
be
met
with
that
unqualified
submission
which
must
have
shamed
the
worst
temper
into
eivé
on
one
occasion
made
a
similar
request
but
besides
that
i
realised
the
convenience
of
a
medium
of
communication
understood
by
ourselves
alone
i
had
no
inclination
to
expose
either
my
own
temper
or
eivé
to
the
trial
eveena
second
request
came
naturally
from
one
whose
favourite
amusement
had
been
the
raising
and
modification
of
flowers
she
asked
to
be
entrusted
with
the
charge
of
the
seeds
i
had
brought
from
earth
and
to
be
permitted
to
form
a
bed
in
the
peristyle
for
the
purpose
of
the
experiment
though
this
disfigured
the
perfect
arrangement
of
the
garden
i
was
delighted
to
have
so
important
and
interesting
a
problem
worked
out
by
hands
so
skilful
and
so
careful
i
should
probably
have
failed
to
rear
a
single
plant
even
had
i
been
familiar
with
those
applications
of
electricity
to
the
purpose
which
are
so
extensively
employed
in
mars
eveena
managed
to
produce
specimens
strangely
altered
sometimes
stunted
sometimes
greatly
improved
from
about
of
the
seeds
entrusted
to
her
and
among
those
with
which
she
was
most
brilliantly
successful
were
some
specimens
of
turkish
roses
the
roses
of
the
attar
which
i
had
obtained
at
stamboul
my
admiration
of
her
patience
and
pleasure
in
her
success
deeply
gratified
her
and
it
was
a
full
reward
for
all
her
trouble
when
i
suggested
that
she
should
send
to
her
sister
zevle
a
small
packet
of
each
of
the
seeds
with
which
she
had
succeeded
it
happened
however
that
the
few
rose
seeds
had
all
been
planted
and
the
flowers
though
apparently
perfect
produced
no
seed
of
their
own
probably
because
they
were
not
suited
to
the
taste
of
the
and
eveena
somehow
forgot
or
failed
to
employ
the
process
of
artificial
fertilisation
if
anything
could
have
fully
reconciled
my
conscience
to
the
household
relations
in
which
i
was
rather
by
weakness
than
by
will
inextricably
entangled
it
would
have
been
the
certainty
that
by
the
sacrifice
eveena
had
herself
enforced
on
me
and
which
she
persistently
refused
to
recognise
as
such
she
alone
had
suffered
true
that
i
could
not
give
and
could
hardly
affect
for
the
wives
bestowed
on
me
by
another
choice
even
such
love
as
the
head
of
a
moslem
household
may
distribute
among
as
many
inmates
but
to
what
i
could
call
love
they
had
never
looked
forward
but
for
the
example
daily
presented
before
their
own
eyes
they
would
no
more
have
missed
than
they
comprehended
it
that
they
were
happier
than
they
had
expected
far
happier
than
they
would
have
been
in
an
ordinary
home
happier
certainly
than
in
the
schools
they
had
quitted
i
could
not
doubt
and
they
did
not
affect
to
deny
if
my
patience
were
not
proof
against
vexations
the
more
exasperating
from
their
pettiness
and
the
sense
of
ridicule
which
constantly
attached
to
them
i
could
read
in
the
manner
of
most
and
understand
from
the
words
of
eunané
who
seldom
hesitated
to
speak
her
mind
whether
its
utterances
were
flattering
or
wounding
that
she
and
her
companions
found
me
not
only
far
more
indulgent
but
incomparably
more
just
than
they
had
been
taught
to
hope
a
man
could
be
of
justice
indeed
as
consisting
in
restraint
on
one
own
temper
and
consideration
for
the
temper
of
others
martial
manhood
is
incapable
or
at
any
rate
martial
womanhood
never
suspects
its
masters
moreover
though
no
longer
blest
with
the
spirits
of
youth
and
finding
little
pleasure
in
what
youth
calls
pleasure
i
had
escaped
the
kind
of
satiety
that
seems
to
attend
lives
more
softly
spent
than
mine
had
been
and
found
a
very
real
and
unfading
enjoyment
in
witnessing
the
keen
enjoyment
of
these
youthful
natures
in
such
liberty
as
could
be
accorded
and
such
amusements
as
the
life
of
this
dull
and
practical
world
affords
among
these
two
at
least
are
closely
similar
to
the
two
favourite
pleasures
of
european
society
music
appears
to
have
been
carried
like
most
arts
and
sciences
to
a
point
of
mechanical
perfection
which
i
should
suppose
like
much
of
the
artificial
accuracy
and
ease
which
civilisation
has
introduced
mars
rather
than
enhances
the
natural
gratification
enjoyed
by
simpler
ages
and
races
almost
deaf
to
music
as
distinguished
from
noise
i
did
not
attempt
to
comprehend
the
construction
of
martial
instruments
or
the
nature
of
the
concords
they
emitted
one
only
struck
me
with
especial
surprise
by
a
peculiarity
which
if
i
could
not
understand
i
could
not
mistake
a
number
of
variously
coloured
flames
are
made
to
synchronise
with
or
actually
emit
a
number
of
corresponding
notes
dancing
to
or
more
properly
weaving
a
series
of
strangely
combined
movements
in
accord
with
the
music
whose
vibrations
were
directly
and
inseparably
connected
with
their
motion
but
all
music
is
the
work
of
professional
musicians
never
the
occupation
of
woman
leisure
never
made
more
charming
to
the
ear
by
its
association
with
the
movement
of
beloved
hands
or
the
tones
of
a
cherished
voice
electric
wires
connected
with
the
vast
buildings
wherein
instruments
produce
what
sounds
like
fine
choral
singing
as
well
as
musical
notes
enable
the
householder
to
turn
on
at
pleasure
music
equal
i
suppose
to
the
finest
operatic
performances
or
the
grandest
oratorio
and
listen
to
it
at
leisure
from
the
cushions
of
his
own
peristyle
this
was
a
great
though
not
wholly
new
delight
to
eunané
and
most
of
her
companions
for
their
sake
only
would
eveena
ever
have
resorted
to
it
for
though
herself
appreciating
music
not
less
highly
and
educated
to
understand
it
much
more
thoroughly
than
they
she
could
derive
little
gratification
from
that
which
was
clearly
incomprehensible
if
not
disagreeable
to
me
could
hardly
enjoy
a
pleasure
i
could
not
share
the
theatre
was
a
more
prized
and
less
common
indulgence
it
is
little
frequented
by
the
elder
martialists
and
not
enjoying
it
themselves
they
seldom
sacrifice
their
hours
to
the
enjoyment
of
their
women
but
it
forms
so
important
an
aid
to
education
and
tends
so
much
to
keep
alive
in
the
public
memory
impressions
which
policy
will
not
permit
to
fade
that
both
from
the
state
and
from
the
younger
portion
of
the
community
it
receives
an
encouragement
quite
sufficient
to
reward
the
few
who
bestow
their
time
and
talent
upon
it
great

or

look
down
thereon

behind

further
extremity

constantly
filled
there
are
no

and
martial
feeling
would
hardly
allow
the
appearance
of

as
actresses

an
art
somewhat
analogous
to
but
infinitely
surpassing
that
displayed
in
the
manipulation

the
most
skilfully
constructed
and
most
complicated

of

to
speak

in

are
given
out
by
a
gigantic
hidden
phonograph
into
which
the
several
parts
have
long
ago
been
carefully
spoken
by
male
and

voices

best
suited
to
each
character

by
the
reversal
of
its
motion
can
repeat
the
original
words
almost
for
ever
with
the
original
tone

and
expression
the
illusion
is
far
more
perfect
than
that
obtained
by
all
the
resources
of

all
the
skill
of
the
actor

in
the
best
theatres
of
france
after
the
first
novelty

and

were
exhausted
i
must
confess
that
these
representations
simply
bored
me
the
more
from
their
length
and
character
but
even
eveena
enjoyed
them
thoroughly

my
other
companions
prized
an
evening

all
other
indulgences

completely
private

to

strictest

gone
by
before

and
invention
had
created
the
perfect
but
monotonous
civilisation
that
now
prevails
one
of
the
most
interesting
performances
i
witnessed
commenced
with
the
exhibition
of
a
striking
scene
in
which
the
union
of
all
the
various
states
that
had
up
to
that
time
divided
the
planet
surface
and
occasionally
waged
war
on
one
another
in
the
first
congress
of
the
world
was
realised
in
the
exact
reproduction
of
every
detail
which
historic
records
have
preserved
afterwards
was
depicted
the
confusion
declining
into
barbarism
and
rapid
degradation
of
the
communistic
revolution
the
secession
of
the
zveltau
and
their
merely
political
adherents
the
construction
of
their
cities
fleets
and
artillery
the
terrible
battles
in
which
the
numbers
of
the
communists
were
hurled
back
or
annihilated
by
the
asphyxiator
and
the
lightning
gun
and
finally
the
most
remarkable
scene
in
all
martial
history
when
the
last
representatives
of
the
great
anarchy
squalid
miserable
degraded
and
debased
in
form
and
features
as
well
as
indicating
by
their
dress
and
appearance
the
utter
ruin
of
art
and
industry
under
their
rule
came
into
the
presence
of
the
chief
ruler
of
the
rising
state
surrounded
by
all
the
splendour
which
the
magic
of
property
stimulating
invention
and
fostering
science
had
created
to
entreat
admission
into
the
realm
of
restored
civilisation
and
a
share
in
the
blessings
they
had
so
deliberately
forfeited
and
so
long
striven
to
deny
to
others
chapter
xxi
private
audiences
i
spent
my
days
between
mist
and
mist
according
to
the
martial
saying
not
infrequently
in
excursions
more
or
less
extensive
and
adventurous
in
which
i
could
but
seldom
ask
eveena
company
and
did
not
care
for
any
other
comparatively
courageous
as
she
had
learned
to
be
and
free
from
all
affectation
of
pretty
feminine
fear
eveena
could
never
realise
the
practical
immunity
from
ordinary
danger
which
a
strength
virtually
double
that
i
had
enjoyed
on
earth
and
thorough
familiarity
with
the
dangers
of
travel
of
mountaineering
and
of
the
chase
afforded
me
when
therefore
i
ventured
among
the
hills
alone
followed
the
fishermen
and
watched
their
operations
sometimes
in
terribly
rough
weather
from
the
little
open
which
i
could
manage
myself
i
preferred
to
give
her
no
definite
idea
of
my
intentions
davilo
however
protested
against
my
exposure
to
a
peril
of
which
eveena
was
happily
as
yet
unaware
if
your
intentions
are
never
known
beforehand
he
said
still
your
habit
of
going
forth
alone
in
places
to
which
your
steps
might
easily
be
dogged
where
you
might
be
shot
from
an
ambush
or
drowned
by
a
sudden
attack
from
a
submarine
vessel
will
soon
be
pretty
generally
understood
if
as
i
fear
a
regular
watch
is
set
upon
your
life
at
least
let
me
know
what
your
intentions
are
before
starting
and
make
your
absences
as
irregular
and
sudden
as
possible
the
less
they
are
known
beforehand
even
in
your
own
household
the
better
is
it
midnight
still
in
the
council
chamber
i
asked
very
nearly
so
she
who
has
told
so
much
can
tell
us
no
more
the
clue
that
placed
her
in
mental
relations
with
the
danger
did
not
extend
to
its
authorship
we
have
striven
hard
to
find
in
every
conceivable
direction
some
material
key
to
the
plot
some
object
which
having
been
in
contact
with
the
persons
of
those
we
suspect
probably
at
the
time
when
their
plans
were
arranged
might
serve
as
a
link
between
her
thoughts
and
theirs
but
as
yet
unsuccessfully
either
her
vision
is
darkened
or
the
connection
we
have
sought
to
establish
is
wanting
but
you
know
who
is
your
unsparing
personal
enemy
and
after
the
sovereign
himself
no
man
in
this
world
is
so
powerful
while
the
sovereign
himself
is
owing
to
the
restraints
of
his
position
less
active
less
familiar
with
others
less
acquainted
with
what
goes
on
out
of
his
own
sight
again
i
say
we
can
avenge
but
against
secret
murder
our
powers
only
avail
to
deter
if
we
would
save
it
must
be
by
the
use
of
natural
precautions
what
he
said
made
me
desirous
of
some
conversation
with
eveena
before
i
started
on
a
meditated
visit
to
the
palace
if
i
could
not
tell
her
the
whole
truth
she
knew
something
and
i
thought
it
possible
on
this
occasion
so
far
to
enlighten
her
as
to
consult
with
her
how
the
secret
of
my
intended
journeys
should
in
future
be
kept
but
i
found
no
chance
of
speaking
to
her
until
shortly
before
my
departure
i
was
called
upon
to
decide
one
of
the
childish
disputes
which
constantly
disturbed
my
temper
and
comfort
mere
fleabites
they
were
but
fleas
have
often
kept
me
awake
a
whole
night
in
a
turkish
caravanserai
and
mosquitos
inside
an
indian
tent
have
broken
up
the
sleep
earned
on
a
long
day
march
or
a
sharply
contested
battlefield
i
need
only
say
that
i
extorted
at
last
from
eveena
a
clear
statement
of
the
trifle
at
issue
which
flatly
contradicted
those
of
the
four
participants
in
the
squabble
she
began
to
suggest
a
means
of
proving
the
truth
and
they
broke
into
angry
clamour
silencing
them
all
peremptorily
i
drew
eveena
into
my
own
chamber
and
when
assured
that
we
were
unheard
reproved
her
for
proposing
to
support
her
own
word
by
evidence
do
you
think
i
said
that
any
possible
proof
would
induce
me
to
doubt
you
or
add
anything
to
the
assurance
i
derive
from
your
word
but
she
urged
that
can
not
be
just
to
others
they
must
feel
it
very
hard
that
your
love
for
me
makes
you
take
all
i
say
for
truth
not
my
love
but
my
knowledge
not
righteous
overmuch
forget
that
they
the
truth
as
well
as
you
i
would
hear
no
more
and
passed
to
the
matter
i
had
at
heart
earnestly
and
in
a
sense
sincerely
as
upon
my
second
audience
i
had
thanked
the
camptâ
for
his
munificent
gifts
no
day
passed
that
i
would
not
thankfully
have
renounced
the
wealth
he
had
bestowed
if
i
could
at
the
same
time
have
renounced
what
was
in
intention
and
according
to
martial
ideas
the
most
gracious
and
most
remarkable
of
his
favours
on
the
present
occasion
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
such
renunciation
might
have
been
possible
the
prince
had
after
our
first
interview
observed
with
regard
to
every
point
of
my
story
on
which
i
had
been
carefully
silent
a
delicacy
of
reserve
very
unusual
among
martialists
and
quite
unintelligible
to
his
court
and
officers
the
conversation
in
public
turned
again
upon
my
voyage
endo
and
another
studiously
directed
it
to
the
method
of
steering
and
the
intentional
diminution
of
speed
in
my
descent
corresponding
to
its
gradual
increase
at
the
commencement
of
the
journey
points
at
which
they
hoped
to
find
some
opening
to
the
mystery
of
the
motive
force
the
prince
relieved
me
from
some
embarrassment
by
requesting
me
as
usual
to
attend
him
to
his
private
cabinet
he
said
i
have
not
as
you
must
be
aware
pressed
you
to
disclose
a
secret
which
for
some
reason
or
other
you
are
evidently
anxious
to
preserve
of
course
the
exclusive
possession
of
a
motive
power
so
marvellous
as
that
employed
in
your
voyage
is
of
almost
incalculable
pecuniary
value
and
it
is
perfectly
right
that
you
should
use
your
own
discretion
with
regard
to
the
time
and
the
terms
of
its
communication
pardon
me
i
interposed
if
i
interrupt
you
prince
to
prevent
any
misconception
it
is
not
with
a
view
to
profit
that
i
have
carefully
avoided
giving
any
clue
whatever
to
my
secret
tour
munificence
would
render
it
most
ungrateful
and
unjust
in
me
to
haggle
over
the
price
of
any
service
i
could
render
you
and
i
should
be
greedy
indeed
if
i
desired
greater
wealth
than
you
have
bestowed
if
i
may
say
so
without
offending
i
earnestly
wish
that
you
would
permit
me
by
resigning
your
gifts
to
retain
in
my
own
eyes
the
right
to
keep
my
secret
without
seeming
undutiful
or
unthankful
i
have
said
he
replied
that
on
that
point
you
misconceive
our
respective
positions
no
one
supposes
that
you
are
indebted
to
us
for
anything
more
than
it
was
the
duty
of
the
sovereign
to
give
as
a
mark
of
the
universal
admiration
and
respect
to
our
guest
from
another
world
still
less
could
any
imagine
that
on
such
a
trifle
could
be
founded
any
claim
to
a
secret
so
invaluable
you
will
offend
me
much
and
only
if
you
ever
again
speak
of
yourself
as
bound
by
personal
obligation
to
me
or
mine
but
as
we
are
wishful
to
buy
so
i
can
not
understand
any
reluctance
on
your
part
to
sell
your
secret
on
your
own
terms
i
think
prince
i
replied
that
i
have
already
asked
you
what
you
would
think
of
a
subject
of
your
own
who
should
put
such
a
power
into
the
hands
of
enemies
as
formidable
to
you
as
you
would
be
to
the
races
of
the
earth
and
think
he
rejoined
with
a
smile
that
i
reminded
you
how
little
my
judgment
would
matter
to
one
possessed
of
such
a
power
i
have
gathered
from
your
conversation
how
easily
we
might
conquer
a
world
as
far
behind
us
in
destructive
powers
as
in
general
civilisation
but
why
should
you
object
you
can
make
your
own
terms
both
for
yourself
and
for
any
of
your
race
for
whom
you
feel
an
especial
interest
a
traitor
is
none
the
less
a
despicable
and
loathsome
wretch
because
his
prince
can
not
punish
him
i
am
bound
by
no
direct
tie
of
loyalty
to
any
terrestrial
sovereign
i
was
born
the
subject
of
one
of
the
greatest
monarchs
of
the
earth
i
left
his
country
at
an
early
age
and
my
youth
was
passed
in
the
service
of
less
powerful
rulers
to
one
at
least
of
whom
i
long
owed
the
same
military
allegiance
that
binds
your
guards
and
officers
to
yourself
but
that
obligation
also
is
at
an
end
nevertheless
i
can
not
but
recognise
that
i
owe
a
certain
fealty
to
the
race
to
which
i
belong
a
duty
to
right
and
justice
even
if
i
thought
which
i
do
not
think
that
the
earth
would
be
better
governed
and
its
inhabitants
happier
under
your
rule
i
should
have
no
right
to
give
them
up
to
a
conquest
i
know
they
would
fiercely
and
righteously
resist
if
pardon
me
for
saying
it
you
prince
would
commit
no
common
crime
in
assailing
and
slaughtering
those
who
neither
have
wronged
nor
can
wrong
you
one
of
themselves
would
be
tenfold
more
guilty
in
sharing
your
enterprise
you
shall
ensure
he
replied
the
good
government
of
your
own
world
as
you
will
you
shall
rule
it
with
all
the
authority
possessed
by
the
regents
under
me
and
by
the
laws
which
you
think
best
suited
to
races
very
different
from
our
own
you
shall
be
there
as
great
and
absolute
as
i
am
here
paying
only
an
obedience
to
me
and
my
successors
which
at
so
immense
a
distance
can
be
little
more
than
formal
is
it
to
acquire
a
merely
formal
power
that
a
prince
like
yourself
would
risk
the
lives
of
your
own
people
and
sacrifice
those
of
millions
of
another
race
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
replied
i
count
on
commanding
the
expedition
myself
and
perhaps
i
care
more
for
the
adventure
than
for
its
fruits
you
will
not
expect
me
to
be
more
chary
of
the
lives
of
others
than
of
my
own
i
understand
and
as
a
soldier
could
share
perhaps
a
feeling
natural
to
a
great
a
capable
and
an
ambitious
prince
but
alike
as
soldier
and
subject
it
is
my
duty
to
resist
not
to
aid
such
an
ambition
my
life
is
at
your
disposal
but
even
to
save
my
life
i
could
not
betray
the
lives
of
hundreds
of
millions
and
the
future
of
a
whole
world
i
fail
to
understand
you
fully
he
said
abandoning
with
a
sigh
a
hope
that
had
evidently
been
the
object
of
long
and
eager
but
in
no
case
would
i
try
to
force
from
you
what
you
will
not
give
or
sell
and
if
you
speak
sincerely
and
i
suppose
you
must
do
so
since
i
can
see
no
motive
but
those
you
assign
that
could
induce
you
to
refuse
my
offer
i
must
believe
in
the
existence
of
what
i
have
heard
of
now
and
then
but
deemed
incredible
men
who
are
governed
by
care
for
other
things
than
their
own
interests
who
believe
in
right
and
wrong
and
would
rather
suffer
injustice
than
commit
it
you
may
be
sure
prince
i
replied
perhaps
imprudently
that
there
are
such
men
in
your
own
world
though
they
are
perhaps
among
those
who
are
least
known
and
least
likely
to
be
seen
at
your
court
if
you
know
them
he
said
you
will
render
me
no
little
service
in
bringing
them
to
my
knowledge
it
is
possible
i
ventured
to
observe
that
their
distinguishing
excellences
are
connected
with
other
distinctions
which
might
render
it
a
disservice
to
them
to
indicate
their
peculiar
character
i
will
not
say
to
yourself
but
to
those
around
you
i
hardly
understand
you
he
rejoined
take
however
my
assurance
that
nothing
you
say
here
shall
without
your
own
consent
be
used
elsewhere
it
is
no
light
gratification
no
trifling
advantage
to
me
to
find
one
man
who
has
neither
fear
nor
interest
that
can
induce
him
to
lie
to
me
to
whom
i
can
speak
not
as
sovereign
to
subject
but
as
man
to
man
and
of
whose
private
conversation
my
courtiers
and
officials
are
not
yet
suspicious
or
jealous
you
shall
never
repent
any
confidence
you
give
to
me
my
interest
in
and
respect
for
the
strange
character
so
manifestly
suited
for
so
intensely
weary
of
the
grandest
position
that
man
could
fill
increased
with
each
successive
interview
i
never
envied
that
greatness
which
seems
to
most
men
so
enviable
the
servitude
of
a
constitutional
king
so
often
a
puppet
in
the
hands
of
the
worst
and
meanest
of
men
those
who
prostitute
their
powers
as
rulers
of
a
state
to
their
interests
as
chiefs
of
a
faction
must
seem
pitiable
to
any
rational
manhood
but
even
the
autocracy
of
the
sultan
or
the
czar
seems
ill
to
compensate
the
utter
isolation
of
the
throne
the
lonely
grandeur
of
one
who
can
hardly
have
a
friend
since
he
can
never
have
an
equal
among
those
around
him
i
do
not
wonder
that
a
tinge
of
is
so
often
perceptible
in
the
chiefs
of
that
great
house
whose
oriental
absolutism
is
only
tempered
by
assassination
but
an
earthly
sovereign
may
now
and
then
meet
his
whether
as
friends
or
foes
on
terms
of
frank
hatred
or
loyal
openness
his
domestic
relations
though
never
secure
and
simple
as
those
of
other
men
may
relieve
him
at
times
from
the
oppressive
sense
of
his
sublime
solitude
and
to
his
wife
at
any
rate
he
may
for
a
few
minutes
or
hours
be
the
husband
and
not
the
king
but
the
absolute
ruler
of
this
lesser
world
had
neither
equal
friends
nor
open
foes
neither
wife
nor
child
how
natural
then
his
weariness
of
his
own
life
how
inevitable
his
impatient
scorn
of
those
to
whom
that
life
was
devoted
a
despot
not
even
accountable
to
god
a
prince
who
till
he
conversed
with
me
never
knew
that
the
universe
contained
his
equal
or
his
like
it
spoke
much
both
for
the
natural
strength
and
soundness
of
his
intellect
and
for
the
excellence
of
his
education
that
he
was
so
sane
a
man
so
earnest
active
and
just
a
ruler
his
reign
was
signalised
by
a
better
police
a
more
even
administration
of
justice
a
greater
efficiency
judgment
and
energy
in
the
execution
of
great
works
of
public
utility
than
his
realm
had
known
for
a
thousand
years
and
his
duty
was
done
as
diligently
and
conscientiously
as
if
he
had
known
that
conscience
was
the
voice
of
a
supreme
sovereign
and
duty
the
law
of
an
unerring
and
unescapable
lawgiver
alone
among
a
race
of
utterly
egotistical
cowards
he
had
the
courage
of
a
soldier
and
the
principles
or
at
least
the
instincts
worthy
of
a
child
of
the
star
with
him
alone
could
i
have
felt
a
moment
security
from
savage
attempts
to
extort
by
terror
or
by
torture
the
secret
i
refused
to
sell
and
i
believe
that
his
generous
abstinence
from
such
an
attempt
was
as
exasperating
as
it
was
incomprehensible
to
his
advisers
and
chiefly
contributed
to
involve
him
in
the
vengeance
which
baffled
greed
and
humbled
personal
pride
had
leagued
to
wreak
upon
myself
as
on
those
with
whose
welfare
and
safety
my
own
were
inextricably
intertwined
it
was
a
fortunate
if
not
a
providential
combination
of
circumstances
that
compelled
the
enemies
of
the
star
primarily
on
my
account
to
interweave
with
their
scheme
of
murderous
persecution
and
private
revenge
an
equally
ruthless
and
atrocious
treason
against
the
throne
and
person
of
their
monarch
my
audience
had
detained
me
longer
than
i
had
expected
and
the
evening
mist
had
fairly
closed
in
before
i
returned
entering
not
as
usual
through
the
grounds
and
the
peristyle
but
by
the
vestibule
and
my
own
chamber
and
hidden
by
my
window
i
overheard
an
exceedingly
characteristic
discussion
on
the
incident
of
the
morning
serve
her
right
leenoo
was
saying
that
she
should
for
once
get
the
worst
of
it
and
be
disbelieved
to
sharpen
the
sting
how
do
you
know
asked
enva
i
do
feel
so
sure
we
have
heard
the
last
of
it
eveena
did
not
seem
to
have
liked
her
answered
leenoo
spitefully
besides
if
he
did
not
disbelieve
her
story
he
would
have
let
her
prove
it
is
that
your
reliance
broke
in
eunané
then
you
are
swinging
on
a
rotten
branch
i
would
not
believe
my
ears
if
for
all
that
all
of
us
could
invent
against
her
i
heard
him
so
much
as
ask
eveena
you
speaking
the
truth
it
is
very
uneven
measure
muttered
enva
uneven
cried
eunané
now
i
think
have
the
best
right
to
be
jealous
of
her
place
and
it
does
sting
me
that
when
he
takes
me
for
his
companion
out
of
doors
or
makes
most
of
me
at
home
it
is
so
plain
that
he
is
taking
trouble
as
if
he
grudged
a
soft
word
or
a
kiss
to
another
as
something
stolen
from
her
but
he
deals
evenly
after
all
if
he
were
less
tender
of
her
we
should
have
to
draw
our
zones
tighter
but
he
wo
give
us
the
chance
to
say
the
with
stick
and
the
with
sugar
i
do
say
it
she
is
never
snubbed
or
silenced
and
if
she
has
had
worse
than
what
he
calls
i
believe
it
is
the
first
time
she
has
never
cause
to
wear
the
veil
before
the
to
hide
blushes
or
tears
or
found
that
his
can
give
sharper
sting
than
their
kiss
can
heal
like
the
rest
of
us
what
for
if
he
wished
to
find
her
in
fault
he
would
have
to
watch
her
dreams
do
you
expect
him
to
be
harder
to
her
than
to
us
he
for
stains
with
a
microscope
none
of
us
can
say
that
he
tears
for
taste
none
of
us
ever
because
the
sun
scorched
would
you
have
him
her
hands
for
being
white
punish
her
for
perfection
she
is
never
at
fault
because
he
never
believes
us
against
her
returned
leenoo
how
often
would
he
have
been
right
i
saw
nothing
of
quarrel
but
i
know
beforehand
where
the
truth
lay
i
tell
you
this
he
hates
the
sandal
more
than
the
sin
but
strange
as
it
seems
he
hates
a
falsehood
worse
still
and
a
falsehood
against
eveena
if
you
want
to
feel
the
cuts
when
the
sheath
bursts
let
him
find
you
out
in
an
experiment
like
this
you
congratulate
yourself
leenoo
that
you
have
got
her
into
trouble
that
you
are
if
you
have
you
had
better
have
poisoned
his
cup
before
his
eyes
for
every
tear
he
sees
her
shed
he
will
reckon
with
us
at
twelve
years
usury
have
made
her
shed
some
retorted
enva
yes
said
eunané
and
if
he
knew
it
i
should
like
half
a
penance
in
the
black
sash
as
the
black
sheep
or
scapegoat
of
her
nursery
better
than
my
next
alone
with
him
when
i
was
silly
enough
to
tie
the
veil
over
her
mouth
take
the
lead
in
sending
her
to
coventry
the
day
after
we
came
here
i
expected
to
pay
for
it
and
thought
the
fruit
worth
the
scratches
but
when
he
came
in
that
evening
nodded
and
spoke
kindly
to
us
but
with
his
eyes
seeking
for
her
when
he
saw
her
at
last
sitting
yonder
with
her
head
down
i
saw
how
his
face
darkened
at
the
very
idea
that
she
was
vexed
and
i
thought
the
flash
was
in
the
cloud
when
she
sprang
up
as
he
called
her
and
forced
a
smile
before
he
looked
into
her
face
i
wished
i
had
been
as
ugly
as
minn
oo
that
i
might
have
belonged
to
the
miseries
man
living
rather
than
have
so
provoked
the
giant
but
what
did
he
do
well
that
he
do
hear
you
returned
eunané
but
i
can
answer
nothing
i
shivered
like
a
in
the
wind
when
he
came
into
my
room
but
i
heard
nothing
about
eveena
i
told
eivé
so
next
day
you
remember
eivé
would
have
no
part
with
us
you
were
called
the
cleverest
girl
in
your
nursery
she
said
have
just
tied
your
own
hands
and
given
your
sandal
into
eveena
whenever
she
tells
him
you
will
drink
the
cup
she
chooses
to
mix
for
you
and
very
salt
you
will
find
it
crach
tush
or
stuff
said
eiralé
contemptuously
we
have
her
robe
with
pins
for
half
a
year
since
then
and
she
has
never
been
able
to
make
him
count
them
able
returned
eunané
sharply
do
you
know
no
better
well
i
chose
to
fancy
she
was
holding
this
over
me
to
keep
me
in
her
power
one
day
she
spoke
choosing
her
words
so
carefully
to
warn
me
how
i
was
sure
to
anger
clasfempta
the
master
of
the
household
by
pushing
my
pranks
so
often
to
the
verge
of
safety
and
no
farther
i
answered
her
with
a
taunt
and
of
course
that
evening
i
was
more
perverse
than
ever
till
even
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
when
he
quoted
lightly
treat
whom
haste
or
heat
to
headlong
trespass
urge
the
heaviest
sandals
fit
the
feet
that
ever
tread
the
verge
i
was
well
frightened
i
saw
that
the
bough
had
broken
short
of
the
end
and
that
for
once
clasfempta
could
mean
to
hurt
but
eveena
kept
him
awhile
and
when
he
came
to
me
she
had
persuaded
him
that
i
was
only
mischievous
not
malicious
teasing
rather
than
trespassing
but
his
last
words
showed
that
he
was
not
so
sure
of
that
have
treated
you
this
time
as
a
child
whose
petulance
is
half
play
but
if
you
would
not
have
your
teasing
returned
with
interest
keep
it
clipped
and
keep
it
for
i
have
often
tormented
her
since
then
but
i
could
not
for
shame
help
you
to
spite
her
crach
said
enva
eveena
might
think
it
wise
to
make
friends
with
you
but
would
she
bear
to
be
slighted
and
persecuted
a
whole
summer
if
she
could
help
herself
you
know
that
man
control
in
woman
hand
sorest
tries
the
household
band
closer
favourite
kisses
cling
favourite
fingers
sharper
sting
very
likely
replied
eunané
i
can
not
understand
any
more
than
you
can
why
eveena
screens
instead
of
punishing
us
why
she
endures
what
a
word
to
him
would
put
down
under
her
sandal
but
she
does
does
she
cast
no
shadow
because
it
never
darkens
his
presence
to
us
and
after
all
her
mind
is
not
a
deeper
darkness
to
me
than
his
he
enjoys
life
as
no
man
here
does
but
what
he
enjoys
most
is
a
good
chance
of
losing
it
while
those
who
find
it
so
tedious
guard
it
like
when
the
number
of
accidents
made
it
difficult
to
fill
up
the
southern
hunt
at
any
price
the
camptâ
refusal
to
let
him
go
so
vexed
him
that
eveena
was
half
afraid
to
show
her
sense
of
relief
you
would
think
he
liked
pain
the
scars
of
the
are
not
his
only
or
his
deepest
ones
if
he
did
not
catch
at
every
excuse
to
spare
it
and
again
why
does
he
speak
to
eveena
as
to
the
camptâ
and
to
us
as
to
children
is
his
softest
word
for
us
then
he
is
patient
where
you
expect
no
mercy
and
severe
where
others
would
laugh
when
enva
let
the
electric
stove
overheat
the
water
so
that
he
was
scalded
horribly
in
his
bath
we
all
counted
that
he
would
at
least
have
paid
her
back
the
pain
twice
over
but
as
soon
as
eveena
and
eivé
had
arranged
the
bandages
he
sent
for
her
we
could
scarcely
bring
you
to
him
enva
but
he
put
out
the
only
hand
he
could
move
to
stroke
your
hair
as
he
does
eivé
and
spoke
for
once
with
real
tenderness
as
if
you
were
the
person
to
be
pitied
any
one
else
would
have
laughed
heartily
at
the
figure
her
made
with
half
her
tail
pulled
out
but
not
all
eveena
pleading
could
obtain
pardon
for
me
that
was
caprice
not
even
dealing
said
leenoo
you
were
not
half
so
bad
as
enva
he
made
me
own
that
i
was
replied
eunané
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
suppose
or
say
that
she
did
it
on
purpose
but
i
was
cruel
on
purpose
to
the
bird
if
i
were
not
spiteful
to
its
mistress
you
feel
he
said
intentional
cruelty
is
what
no
ruler
whether
of
a
household
or
of
a
kingdom
has
a
right
to
pass
over
if
not
you
can
hardly
be
fit
for
a
charge
that
gives
animals
into
your
power
i
never
liked
him
half
so
well
and
i
am
sure
i
deserved
a
severer
lesson
since
then
i
can
not
help
liking
them
both
though
it
mortifying
to
feel
that
one
is
nothing
before
her
it
is
intolerable
said
enva
bitterly
i
detest
her
is
it
her
fault
asked
eunané
with
some
warmth
they
are
so
like
each
other
and
so
unlike
us
that
i
could
fancy
she
came
from
his
own
world
i
went
to
her
next
day
in
her
own
room
ay
interjected
leenoo
with
childish
spite
the
foot
and
the
sandal
think
so
returned
eunané
quietly
if
you
like
i
thought
i
owed
her
some
amends
well
she
had
her
bird
in
her
lap
and
i
think
she
was
crying
over
it
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
put
it
out
of
sight
i
began
to
tell
her
how
sorry
i
was
about
it
but
she
would
not
let
me
go
on
she
kissed
me
as
no
one
ever
kissed
me
since
my
school
friend
ernie
died
three
years
ago
and
she
cried
more
over
the
trouble
i
had
brought
on
myself
than
over
her
pet
and
since
then
eunané
went
on
with
a
softened
voice
she
has
showed
me
how
pretty
its
ways
are
how
clever
it
is
how
fond
of
her
and
she
tries
to
make
it
friends
with
me
sometimes
i
do
wonder
she
is
so
much
to
him
and
he
to
her
she
was
brought
up
in
the
home
where
she
was
born
her
father
is
one
of
those
strange
people
and
i
fancy
there
is
something
between
her
and
clasfempta
more
than
i
could
not
let
this
go
on
and
stepping
back
from
the
window
as
if
i
had
but
just
returned
i
called
eunané
by
name
she
came
at
once
a
little
surprised
at
the
summons
but
suspecting
nothing
but
the
first
sight
of
my
face
startled
her
and
when
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
i
took
her
hands
and
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
her
quick
intelligence
perceived
at
once
that
i
had
heard
at
least
part
of
the
conversation
ah
she
said
flushing
and
hanging
her
head
i
am
caught
now
but
in
a
tone
half
of
relief
i
deserve
it
and
i
wo
pretend
to
think
that
you
are
angry
only
because
eveena
is
your
favourite
you
would
not
allow
any
of
us
to
be
spited
if
you
could
help
it
and
it
is
much
worse
to
have
spited
her
i
led
her
by
the
hand
across
the
peristyle
into
her
own
chamber
and
when
the
window
closed
behind
us
drew
her
to
my
side
so
you
would
rather
belong
to
the
worst
master
of
your
own
race
than
to
me
not
now
she
answered
that
was
my
first
thought
when
i
saw
how
you
felt
for
eveena
and
knew
how
angry
you
would
be
when
you
found
how
we
i
mean
how
i
had
used
her
and
i
remembered
how
terribly
strong
you
were
i
know
you
better
now
it
is
for
women
to
strike
with
five
fingers
in
unmeasured
passion
only
do
tell
eveena
besides
she
murmured
colouring
with
drooping
eyelids
i
had
rather
be
beaten
by
you
than
caressed
by
another
eunané
child
you
might
well
say
you
do
understand
me
i
could
not
have
listened
to
your
talk
if
i
had
meant
to
use
it
against
you
and
with
i
have
no
cause
to
be
displeased
nay
as
she
looked
up
in
surprise
i
know
you
have
not
used
eveena
kindly
but
i
heard
from
yourself
that
you
had
repented
that
she
who
could
never
be
coaxed
or
compelled
to
say
what
made
her
unhappy
or
even
to
own
that
i
had
guessed
it
truly
has
fully
forgiven
you
you
do
need
to
be
told
indeed
i
do
understand
the
girl
sobbed
eveena
is
always
so
strangely
soft
and
gentle
she
would
rather
suffer
without
reason
than
let
us
suffer
who
deserve
it
but
just
because
she
is
so
kind
you
must
feel
the
more
bitterly
for
her
besides
she
went
on
i
was
so
jealous
as
if
you
could
compare
me
with
her
even
after
i
had
felt
her
kindness
no
you
can
not
forgive
and
you
ought
not
child
i
answered
sadly
enough
for
my
conscience
was
as
ill
at
ease
as
hers
with
deeper
cause
i
do
tell
you
that
your
jealousy
was
not
foolish
and
your
petulance
culpable
but
i
do
say
that
neither
eveena
nor
i
have
the
heart
perhaps
i
have
not
even
the
right
to
blame
you
it
is
true
that
i
love
eveena
as
i
can
love
no
other
in
this
world
or
my
own
how
well
she
deserves
that
love
none
but
i
can
know
so
loving
her
i
would
not
willingly
have
brought
any
other
woman
into
a
relation
which
could
make
her
dependent
upon
or
desirous
of
such
love
as
i
can
not
give
you
know
how
this
relation
to
you
and
the
others
was
forced
upon
me
when
i
accepted
it
i
thought
i
could
give
you
as
much
affection
as
you
would
find
elsewhere
how
far
and
why
i
wronged
eveena
is
between
her
and
myself
i
did
not
think
that
i
could
be
wronging
you
very
little
of
this
was
intelligible
to
eunané
she
felt
a
tenderness
she
had
never
before
received
but
she
could
not
understand
my
doubt
and
she
replied
only
to
my
last
words
wrong
us
how
could
you
did
we
ask
whether
you
had
another
wife
or
who
would
be
your
favourite
did
you
promise
to
like
us
or
even
to
be
kind
to
us
you
might
have
neglected
us
altogether
made
one
girl
your
sole
companion
kept
all
indulgences
all
favours
for
her
and
how
would
you
have
wronged
us
if
you
had
turned
on
us
when
she
vexed
you
humbled
us
to
gratify
her
caprice
us
to
vent
your
temper
other
men
would
have
done
the
same
who
else
would
have
treated
us
as
you
have
done
who
would
have
been
careful
to
give
each
of
us
her
share
in
every
pleasure
her
turn
in
every
holiday
her
employment
at
home
her
place
in
your
company
abroad
who
would
have
inquired
into
the
truth
of
our
complaints
and
the
merits
of
our
quarrels
would
have
made
so
many
excuses
for
our
faults
given
us
so
many
patient
warnings
wronged
us
there
may
be
some
of
us
who
do
like
you
there
is
not
one
who
could
bear
to
be
sent
away
not
one
who
would
exchange
this
house
for
the
palace
of
the
camptâ
though
you
pronounce
him
kingly
in
nature
as
in
power
she
spoke
as
she
believed
if
she
spoke
in
error
if
so
my
child
why
have
you
all
been
so
bitter
against
eveena
why
have
you
yourself
been
jealous
of
one
who
as
you
admit
has
been
a
favourite
only
in
a
love
you
did
not
expect
but
we
saw
it
and
we
envied
her
so
much
love
so
much
respect
she
replied
frankly
and
for
myself
she
coloured
faltered
and
was
silent
for
yourself
my
child
i
was
a
vain
fool
she
broke
out
impetuously
they
told
me
that
i
was
beautiful
and
clever
and
companionable
i
fancied
i
should
be
your
favourite
and
hold
the
first
place
and
when
i
saw
her
i
would
not
see
her
grace
and
gentleness
or
observe
her
soft
sweet
voice
and
the
charms
that
put
my
figure
and
complexion
to
shame
and
the
quiet
sense
and
truth
that
were
worth
twelvefold
my
quickness
my
memory
and
my
handiness
i
was
disappointed
and
mortified
that
she
should
be
preferred
oh
how
you
must
hate
me
clasfempta
for
i
hate
myself
while
i
tell
you
what
i
have
been
according
to
european
doctrine
my
fealty
to
eveena
must
then
have
been
in
peril
and
yet
warmly
as
i
felt
for
eunané
the
element
in
her
passionate
confession
that
touched
me
most
was
her
recognition
of
eveena
superiority
and
as
i
soothed
and
comforted
the
penitent
i
thought
how
much
it
would
please
eveena
that
i
had
at
last
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
companion
she
avowedly
liked
the
best
but
eunané
i
said
at
last
do
you
remember
what
you
were
saying
when
i
called
you
called
you
on
purpose
to
stop
you
you
said
that
there
was
something
between
eveena
and
myself
more
than
than
what
what
did
you
mean
speak
frankly
child
i
know
that
this
time
you
were
not
going
to
scald
me
on
purpose
i
do
know
quite
what
i
meant
she
replied
simply
but
the
first
time
you
took
me
out
i
heard
the
superintendent
say
some
strange
things
and
then
he
checked
himself
when
he
found
your
companion
was
not
eveena
then
eivé
i
mean
you
use
expressions
sometimes
in
talking
to
eveena
that
we
never
heard
before
i
think
there
is
some
secret
between
you
and
if
there
be
eunané
were
going
to
betray
it
to
set
enva
and
leenoo
on
to
find
it
out
i
did
not
think
she
said
i
never
do
think
before
i
get
into
trouble
i
do
say
forgive
me
this
time
but
i
hold
my
tongue
for
the
future
by
this
time
our
evening
meal
was
ready
as
i
led
eunané
to
her
place
eveena
looked
up
with
some
little
surprise
it
was
rarely
that
especially
on
returning
from
absence
i
had
sought
any
other
company
than
hers
but
there
was
no
tinge
of
jealousy
or
doubt
in
her
look
on
the
contrary
as
with
her
entire
comprehension
of
every
expression
of
my
face
and
her
quickness
to
read
the
looks
of
others
she
saw
in
both
countenances
that
we
were
on
better
terms
than
ever
before
her
own
brightened
at
the
thought
as
i
placed
myself
beside
her
she
stole
her
hand
unobserved
into
mine
and
pressed
it
as
she
whispered
you
have
found
her
out
at
last
she
is
half
a
child
as
yet
but
she
has
a
heart
and
perhaps
the
only
one
among
them
the
four
as
i
called
them
looked
up
as
we
approached
with
eager
malice
bitterly
disappointed
when
they
saw
that
eunané
had
won
something
more
than
pardon
whatever
penance
they
had
dreaded
their
own
escape
ill
compensated
the
loss
of
their
expected
pleasure
in
the
pain
and
humiliation
of
a
finer
nature
eunané
look
timidly
appealing
to
her
to
ratify
our
full
reconciliation
answered
by
eveena
smile
of
tender
sisterly
sympathy
enhanced
and
completed
their
discomfiture
chapter
xxii
peculiar
institutions
a
chief
luxury
and
expense
in
which
when
aware
what
my
income
was
i
indulged
myself
freely
was
the
purchase
of
martial
literature
only
ephemeral
works
are
as
a
rule
printed
in
the
phonographic
character
which
alone
i
could
read
with
ease
the
martialists
have
no
newspapers
it
does
not
seem
to
them
worth
while
to
record
daily
the
accidents
the
business
incidents
the
prices
the
amusements
and
the
follies
of
the
day
and
politics
they
have
none
in
no
case
would
a
people
so
coldly
wise
so
thoroughly
impressed
by
experience
with
a
sense
of
the
extreme
folly
of
political
agitation
legislative
change
and
democratic
violence
have
cursed
themselves
with
anything
like
the
press
of
europe
or
america
but
as
it
is
all
they
have
to
record
is
gathered
each
twelfth
day
at
the
telegraph
offices
and
from
these
communicated
on
a
single
sheet
about
four
inches
square
to
all
who
care
to
receive
it
but
each
profession
or
occupation
that
boasts
as
do
most
an
organisation
and
a
centre
of
discussion
and
council
issues
at
intervals
books
containing
collected
facts
essays
reports
of
experiments
and
lectures
every
man
who
cares
to
communicate
his
passing
ideas
to
the
public
does
so
by
means
of
the
phonograph
when
he
has
a
graver
work
which
is
in
his
view
at
least
of
permanent
importance
to
publish
it
is
written
in
the
stylographic
character
and
sold
at
the
telegraphic
centres
the
extreme
complication
and
compression
employed
in
this
character
had
as
i
have
already
said
rendered
it
very
difficult
to
me
and
though
i
had
learnt
to
decipher
it
as
a
child
spells
out
the
words
which
a
few
years
later
it
will
read
unconsciously
by
the
eye
the
only
manner
in
which
i
could
quickly
gather
the
sense
of
such
books
was
by
desiring
one
or
other
of
the
ladies
to
read
them
aloud
strangely
enough
next
to
eveena
eivé
was
by
far
the
best
reader
eunané
understood
infinitely
better
what
she
was
perusing
but
the
art
of
reading
aloud
is
useless
and
therefore
never
taught
in
schools
whose
every
pupil
learns
to
read
with
the
usual
facility
a
character
which
the
practised
eye
can
interpret
incomparably
faster
than
the
voice
could
possibly
utter
it
this
reading
might
have
afforded
many
opportunities
of
private
converse
with
eveena
but
that
eivé
whose
knowledge
was
by
no
means
proportionate
to
her
intelligence
entreated
permission
to
listen
to
the
books
i
selected
and
eveena
though
not
partial
to
her
childish
companion
and
admirer
persuaded
me
not
to
refuse
the
story
of
my
voyage
and
reports
of
my
first
audience
at
court
were
of
course
widely
circulated
and
extensively
canvassed
though
regarded
with
no
favour
especially
by
the
professed
philosophers
and
scientists
my
adventures
and
myself
were
naturally
an
object
of
great
curiosity
and
i
was
not
surprised
when
a
civil
if
cold
request
was
preferred
on
behalf
of
what
i
may
call
the
martial
academy
that
i
would
deliver
in
their
hall
a
series
of
lectures
or
rather
a
connected
oral
account
of
the
world
from
which
i
professed
to
have
come
and
of
the
manner
in
which
my
voyage
had
been
accomplished
after
consulting
eveena
and
davilo
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
intended
to
take
the
former
with
me
she
objected
however
that
while
she
had
heard
much
in
her
father
house
and
during
our
travels
of
what
i
had
to
tell
her
companions
scarcely
less
interested
were
comparatively
ignorant
indiscreetly
because
somewhat
provoked
by
these
repeated
sacrifices
as
much
of
my
inclination
as
her
own
i
mentioned
my
purpose
at
our
evening
meal
and
bade
her
name
those
who
should
accompany
me
i
was
a
little
surprised
when
carefully
evading
the
dictation
to
which
she
was
invited
she
suggested
that
eunané
and
eivé
would
probably
most
enjoy
the
opportunity
that
she
should
be
willing
to
get
rid
of
the
most
wilful
and
petulant
of
the
party
seemed
natural
the
other
selection
confirmed
the
impression
i
had
formed
but
dared
not
express
to
one
whom
i
had
never
blamed
without
finding
myself
in
the
wrong
that
eveena
regarded
eivé
with
a
feeling
more
nearly
approaching
to
jealousy
than
her
nature
seemed
capable
of
entertaining
i
obeyed
however
without
comment
and
both
the
companions
selected
for
me
were
delighted
at
the
prospect
the
academy
is
situated
about
between
amacasfe
and
the
residence
the
facilities
of
martial
travelling
and
above
all
of
telegraphic
and
telephonic
communication
dispensing
with
all
reason
for
placing
great
institutions
in
or
near
important
cities
we
travelled
by
balloon
as
i
was
anxious
to
improve
myself
in
the
management
of
these
machines
after
frightening
my
companions
so
far
as
to
provoke
some
outcry
from
eivé
and
from
eunané
some
saucy
remarks
on
my
clumsiness
on
which
no
one
else
would
have
ventured
i
descended
safely
if
not
very
creditably
in
front
of
the
building
which
serves
as
a
local
centre
of
martial
philosophy
the
residences
of
some
sixty
of
the
most
eminent
professors
of
various
sciences
elected
by
their
colleagues
as
seats
fall
vacant
with
the
approval
of
the
highest
court
of
judicature
and
of
the
camptâ
cluster
around
a
huge
building
in
the
form
of
a
hexagon
made
up
of
a
multitude
of
smaller
hexagons
in
the
centre
whereof
is
the
great
hall
of
the
same
shape
in
the
smaller
chambers
which
surround
it
are
telephones
through
which
addresses
delivered
in
a
hundred
different
quarters
are
mechanically
repeated
so
that
the
residents
or
temporary
visitors
can
here
gather
at
once
all
the
knowledge
that
is
communicated
by
any
man
of
note
to
any
audience
throughout
the
planet
on
this
account
numbers
of
young
men
just
emancipated
from
the
colleges
come
here
to
complete
their
education
and
above
each
of
the
auditory
chambers
is
another
divided
into
six
small
rooms
wherein
these
visitors
are
accommodated
a
small
house
belonging
to
one
of
the
members
who
happened
to
be
absent
was
appropriated
to
me
during
my
stay
and
in
its
hall
the
philosophers
gathered
in
the
morning
to
converse
with
or
to
question
me
in
detail
respecting
the
world
whose
existence
they
would
not
formally
admit
but
whose
life
physical
social
and
political
and
whose
scientific
and
human
history
they
regarded
with
as
much
curiosity
as
if
its
reality
were
ascertained
courtesy
forbids
evening
visits
unless
on
distinct
and
pressing
invitation
it
being
supposed
that
the
head
of
a
household
may
care
to
spend
that
part
of
his
time
and
that
alone
with
his
own
family
the
academists
are
provided
by
the
state
with
incomes
of
an
amount
very
much
larger
than
the
modest
allowances
which
the
richest
nations
of
the
earth
almost
grudge
to
the
men
whose
names
in
future
history
will
probably
be
remembered
longer
than
those
of
eminent
statesmen
and
warriors
some
of
them
have
made
considerable
fortunes
by
turning
to
account
in
practical
invention
this
or
that
scientific
discovery
but
as
a
rule
in
mars
as
on
earth
the
gifts
and
the
career
of
the
discoverer
and
the
inventor
are
distinct
it
is
however
from
the
purely
theoretical
labours
of
the
men
of
science
that
the
inventions
useful
in
manufactures
in
communication
in
every
department
of
life
and
business
are
generally
derived
and
the
prejudice
or
judgment
of
this
strange
people
has
laid
it
down
that
those
who
devote
their
lives
to
work
in
itself
unremunerative
but
indirectly
most
valuable
to
the
public
should
be
at
least
as
well
off
as
the
subordinate
servants
of
the
state
in
society
they
are
perhaps
more
honoured
than
any
but
the
highest
public
authorities
and
my
audience
was
the
most
distinguished
according
to
the
ideas
of
that
world
that
it
could
furnish
at
noon
each
day
i
entered
the
hall
which
was
crowded
with
benches
rising
on
five
sides
from
the
centre
to
the
walls
the
sixth
being
occupied
by
a
platform
where
the
lecturer
and
the
members
of
the
academy
sat
after
each
lecture
which
occupied
some
two
hours
questions
more
or
less
perplexing
were
put
by
the
latter
only
however
on
the
first
occasion
when
i
reserved
as
before
the
zinta
and
the
court
all
information
that
could
enable
my
hearers
to
divine
the
nature
of
the
apergic
force
was
incredulity
so
plainly
insinuated
as
to
amount
to
absolute
insult
if
i
said
you
choose
to
disbelieve
what
i
tell
you
you
are
welcome
to
do
so
but
you
are
not
at
liberty
to
express
your
disbelief
to
me
to
do
so
is
to
charge
me
with
lying
and
to
that
charge
whatever
may
be
the
customs
of
this
world
there
is
in
mine
but
one
answer
and
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
hilt
of
the
sword
i
wore
in
deference
to
davilo
warnings
but
which
he
and
others
considered
a
terrestrial
ornament
rather
than
a
weapon
the
president
of
the
academy
quietly
replied
of
all
the
strange
things
we
have
heard
this
seems
the
strangest
i
waive
the
probability
of
your
statements
or
the
reasonableness
of
the
doubts
suggested
but
i
fail
to
understand
how
here
or
in
any
other
world
if
the
imputation
of
falsehood
be
considered
so
gross
an
offence
and
here
it
is
too
common
to
be
so
regarded
it
can
be
repelled
by
proving
yourself
more
skilled
in
the
use
of
weapons
or
stronger
or
more
daring
than
the
person
who
has
challenged
your
assertion
the
moral
courage
and
of
the
president
were
as
marked
as
his
logic
was
irrefragable
but
my
outbreak
however
illogical
served
its
purpose
no
one
was
disposed
to
give
mortal
offence
to
one
who
showed
himself
so
ready
to
resent
it
though
probably
the
apprehension
related
less
to
my
swordsmanship
than
the
favour
i
was
supposed
to
enjoy
with
the
suzerain
seriously
impressed
by
the
growing
earnestness
of
davilo
warnings
and
feeling
that
i
could
no
longer
conceal
the
pressure
of
some
anxiety
on
my
mind
gradually
cautiously
and
tenderly
i
broke
to
eveena
what
i
had
learned
with
but
two
reserves
i
would
not
render
her
life
miserable
by
the
suggestion
of
possible
treason
in
our
own
household
that
she
might
not
infer
this
for
herself
i
led
her
to
believe
that
the
existence
and
discovery
of
the
conspiracy
was
of
a
date
long
subsequent
to
my
acceptance
of
the
sovereign
unwelcome
gift
she
was
deeply
affected
and
as
i
had
feared
exceedingly
disturbed
but
very
characteristically
the
keenest
impression
made
upon
her
mind
concerned
less
the
urgency
of
the
peril
than
its
origin
the
fact
that
it
was
incurred
through
and
for
her
on
this
she
insisted
much
more
than
seemed
just
or
reasonable
it
was
for
her
sake
no
doubt
that
i
had
made
the
regent
of
elcavoo
my
bitter
irreconcilable
foe
it
was
my
marriage
with
her
the
daughter
of
the
most
eminent
among
the
chiefs
of
the
zinta
that
had
marked
me
out
as
one
of
the
first
and
principal
victims
and
set
on
my
head
a
value
as
high
as
on
that
of
any
of
the
order
save
the
himself
whose
personal
character
and
social
distinction
would
have
indicated
him
as
especially
dangerous
even
had
his
secret
rank
been
altogether
unsuspected
it
was
impossible
to
soothe
eveena
first
outbreak
of
feeling
or
reason
with
her
illogical
compelled
at
last
to
admit
that
the
peril
had
been
unconsciously
incurred
when
she
neither
knew
nor
could
have
known
it
she
pleaded
eagerly
and
earnestly
for
permission
to
repair
by
the
sacrifice
of
herself
the
injury
she
had
brought
upon
me
it
was
useless
to
tell
her
that
the
acceptance
of
such
a
sacrifice
would
be
a
worse
than
death
even
the
depth
and
devotion
of
her
own
love
could
not
persuade
her
to
realise
the
passionate
earnestness
of
mine
it
was
still
more
in
vain
to
remind
her
that
such
a
concession
must
entail
the
dishonour
that
man
fears
above
all
perils
would
brand
me
with
that
indelible
stain
of
abject
personal
cowardice
which
for
ever
degrades
and
ruins
not
only
the
fame
but
the
nature
of
manhood
as
the
stain
of
wilful
unchastity
debases
and
ruins
woman

our
contract
she
insisted
pleading
with
the
overpowering
vehemence
of
a
love
absolutely
unselfish
against
love
deepest
instincts
and
that
egotism
which
is
almost
inseparable
from
it
giving
passionate
utterance
to
an
affection
such
as
men
rarely
feel
for
women

perhaps
never
for
men

the
enemy
to
believe
that
you
have
broken
with
my
father
and
with
his
order
and
favoured
as
you
are
by
the
sovereign
you
will
be
safe
give
what
reason
you
will
say
that
i
have
deserved
it
that
i
have
forced
you
to
it
i
know
that
contracts
revoked
with
the
full
approval
of
the
courts
and
of
the
public
though
i
hardly
know
why
i
will
agree
and
if
we
are
agreed
you
can
give
or
withhold
reasons
as
you
please
nay
there
can
be
no
wrong
to
me
in
doing
what
i
entreat
you
to
do
i
shall
not

no
no

i
will
be

her

white

the
lips

streaming
tears
were
not
needed
to
belie
the
words
by
your
love
for
me

not
let
me
feel
that
you
are
to
die
do
not
keep
me
in
dread
to
hear
that
you
have
died
for
me
and
through
me
if
it
had
been
in
her
power
to
leave
me
if
of
the
promised
period
had
not
been
yet
to
run
she
might
have
enforced
her
purpose
in
despite
of
all
that
i
could
urge
of
reason
of
entreaty
of
the
pleadings
of
a
love
in
this
at
least
as
earnest
as
her
own
nay
she
would
probably
have
left
me
in
the
hope
of
exhibiting
to
the
world
the
appearance
of
an
open
quarrel
but
for
a
peculiarity
of
martial
law
that
law
enforces
on
the
plea
of
either
party
specific
performance
of
the
marriage
contract
i
could
reclaim
her
and
call
the
force
of
the
state
to
recover
her
when
even
this
warning
at
first
failed
to
enforce
her
submission
i
swore
by
all
i
held
sacred
in
my
own
world
and
all
she
revered
in
hers
by
the
symbols
never
lightly
invoked
and
never
in
the
course
of
ages
that
cover
thrice
the
span
of
terrestrial
history
and
tradition
invoked
to
sanction
a
lie
symbols
more
sacred
in
her
eyes
than
in
those
of
mediæval
christendom
the
gathered
relics
that
appalled
the
heroic
soul
of
harold
godwinsson
that
she
should
only
defeat
her
own
purpose
that
i
would
reclaim
my
wife
before
the
order
and
before
the
law
thus
asserting
more
clearly
than
ever
the
strength
of
the
tie
that
bound
me
to
her
and
to
her
house
the
oath
which
it
was
impossible
to
break
perhaps
yet
more
the
cold
and
measured
tone
with
which
i
spoke
in
striving
to
control
the
white
heat
of
a
passion
as
much
stronger
as
it
was
more
selfish
than
hers
a
tone
which
sounded
to
myself
unnatural
and
alien
at
last
compelled
her
to
yield
and
silenced
her
in
the
only
moment
in
which
the
depths
of
that
nature
so
sweet
and
soft
and
gentle
were
stirred
by
the
violence
of
a
moral
tempest
a
marvellously
perfect
example
of
martial
art
and
science
is
furnished
by
the
observatory
of
the
astronomic
academy
on
a
mountain
about
twenty
miles
from
the
residence
the
hill
selected
stands
about
feet
above
the
and
almost
half
that
height
above
any
neighbouring
ground
it
commands
therefore
a
most
perfect
view
of
the
horizon
all
around
even
below
the
technical
or
theoretic
horizon
of
its
latitude
a
volcano
like
all
martial
volcanoes
very
feeble
and
never
bursting
into
eruptions
seriously
dangerous
to
the
dwellers
in
the
neighbouring
plains
existed
at
some
miles
distance
and
caused
earthquakes
or
perhaps
i
should
more
properly
say
disturbances
of
the
surface
which
threatened
occasionally
to
perturb
the
observations
but
the
martialists
grudge
no
cost
to
render
their
scientific
instruments
from
the
observatory
itself
to
the
smallest
lens
or
wheel
it
contains
as
perfect
as
possible
having
decided
that
eanelca
was
very
superior
to
any
other
available
site
they
were
not
to
be
baffled
or
diverted
by
such
a
trifle
as
the
opposition
of
nature
still
less
would
they
allow
that
the
observers
should
be
put
out
by
a
perceptible
disturbance
or
their
observations
falsified
by
one
too
slight
to
be
realised
by
their
senses
if
nature
were
impertinent
enough
to
interfere
with
the
arrangements
of
science
science
must
put
down
the
mutiny
of
nature
as
seas
had
been
bridged
and
continents
cut
through
so
a
volcano
might
and
must
be
suppressed
or
extinguished
a
tunnel
thirty
miles
in
length
was
cut
from
a
great
lake
nearly
a
thousand
feet
higher
than
the
base
of
the
volcano
and
through
this
for
a
quarter
of
a
year
say
some
six
terrestrial
months
water
was
steadily
poured
into
the
subterrene
cavities
wherein
the
eruptive
forces
were
generated
the
plutonic
laboratory
of
the
rebellious
agency
of
course
previous
to
the
adoption
of
this
measure
the
crust
in
the
neighbourhood
had
been
carefully
explored
and
tested
by
various
wonderfully
elaborate
and
perfect
boring
instruments
and
a
map
or
rather
model
of
the
strata
for
a
mile
below
the
surface
and
for
a
distance
around
the
volcano
which
i
dare
not
state
on
the
faith
of
my
recollection
alone
had
been
constructed
on
a
scale
as
we
should
say
of
twelve
inches
to
the
mile
except
for
minor
purposes
for
convenience
of
pocket
carriage
and
the
like
martialists
disdain
so
poor
a
representation
as
a
flat
map
can
give
of
a
broken
surface
on
the
small
scale
they
employ
globes
of
spherical
sections
to
represent
extensive
portions
of
their
world
on
the
large
scale
from
two
to
inches
per
mile
models
of
wonderfully
accurate
construction
consequently
children
understand
and
enjoy
the
geographical
lesson
which
in
european
schools
costs
so
many
tears
to
so
little
purpose
a
girl
of
six
years
knows
more
perfectly
the
whole
area
of
the
martial
globe
than
a
german
professor
that
of
the
ancient
peloponnesus
eivé
the
dunce
of
our
housed
hold
won
a
terrestrial
on
which
she
had
set
her
fancy
by
tracing
on
a
globe
the
first
time
she
saw
it
every
detail
of
my
journey
from
ecasfe
as
she
had
heard
me
relate
it
and
eunané
who
had
never
left
her
nursery
could
describe
beforehand
any
route
i
wished
to
take
between
the
northern
and
southern
under
the
guidance
afforded
by
the
elaborate
model
abovementioned
all
the
hollows
wherein
the
materials
of
eruption
were
stored
and
wherein
the
chemical
forces
of
nature
had
been
at
work
for
ages
were
thoroughly
flooded
of
course
convulsion
after
convulsion
of
the
most
violent
nature
followed
but
in
the
course
of
about
two
hundred
days
the
internal
combustion
was
overmastered
for
lack
of
fuel
the
chemical
combinations
which
might
have
gone
on
for
ages
causing
weak
but
incessant
outbreaks
were
completed
and
their
power
exhausted
this
source
of
disturbance
extinguished
in
the
reign
of
the
predecessor
of
my
royal
patron
the
construction
of
the
great
observatory
on
eanelca
was
commenced
a
very
elaborate
road
winding
round
and
round
the
mountain
at
such
an
incline
as
to
be
easily
ascended
by
the
electric
carriages
was
built
but
this
was
intended
only
as
a
subsidiary
means
of
ascent
right
into
the
bowels
of
the
mountain
a
vast
tunnel
fifty
feet
in
height
was
driven
at
its
inner
extremity
was
excavated
a
chamber
whose
dimensions
are
imperfectly
recorded
in
my
notes
but
which
was
certainly
much
larger
than
the
central
cavern
from
which
radiate
the
principal
galleries
of
the
mammoth
cave
around
this
were
pierced
a
dozen
shafts
emerging
at
different
heights
but
all
near
the
summit
and
all
so
far
outside
the
central
plateau
as
to
leave
the
solid
foundation
on
which
the
observatory
was
to
rest
down
to
the
very
centre
of
the
planet
wholly
undisturbed
through
each
of
these
ascending
and
descending
alternately
pass
two
cars
or
rather
movable
chambers
worked
by
electricity
conveying
passengers
instruments
or
supplies
to
and
from
the
most
convenient
points
in
the
vast
structure
of
the
observatory
itself
the
highest
part
of
ranelca
was
a
rocky
mass
of
some
feet
in
circumference
and
about
in
height
this
was
carved
into
a
perfect
octagon
in
the
sides
of
which
were
arranged
a
number
of
minor
chambers
among
them
those
wherein
transit
and
other
secondary
observations
were
to
be
taken
and
in
which
minor
magnifying
instruments
were
placed
to
scan
their
several
portions
of
the
heavens
within
these
was
excavated
a
circular
central
chamber
the
dome
of
which
was
constructed
of
a
crystal
so
clear
that
i
verily
believe
the
most
exacting
of
terrestrial
astronomers
would
have
been
satisfied
to
make
his
observations
through
it
but
an
opening
was
made
in
this
dome
as
for
the
mounting
of
one
of
our
equatorial
telescopes
and
machinery
was
provided
which
caused
the
roof
to
revolve
with
a
touch
bringing
the
opening
to
bear
on
any
desired
part
of
the
celestial
vault
in
the
centre
of
the
solid
floor
levelled
to
the
utmost
perfection
was
left
a
circular
pillar
supporting
the
polar
axis
of
an
instrument
widely
differing
from
our
telescopes
especially
in
the
fact
that
it
had
no
opaque
tube
connecting
the
essential
lenses
which
we
call
the
and
the
names
not
applicable
to
their
martial
substitutes
on
my
visit
to
the
observatory
however
i
had
not
leisure
to
examine
minutely
the
means
by
which
the
images
of
stars
and
planets
were
produced
i
reserved
this
examination
for
a
second
opportunity
which
as
it
happened
never
occurred
on
this
occasion
eveena
and
eunané
were
with
me
and
the
astronomic
pictures
which
were
to
be
presented
to
us
and
which
they
could
enjoy
and
understand
almost
as
fully
as
myself
sufficiently
occupied
our
time
warned
to
stand
at
such
a
distance
from
the
central
machinery
that
in
a
whole
revolution
no
part
of
it
could
by
any
possibility
touch
us
we
were
placed
near
an
opening
looking
into
a
dark
chamber
with
our
backs
to
the
objects
of
observation
in
this
chamber
not
upon
a
screen
but
suspended
in
the
air
presently
appeared
an
image
several
thousand
times
larger
than
that
of
the
crescent
moon
as
seen
through
a
tube
small
enough
to
correct
the
exaggeration
of
visual
instinct
it
appeared
however
not
flat
as
does
the
moon
to
the
naked
eye
but
evidently
as
part
of
a
sphere
at
some
distance
was
shown
another
crescent
belonging
to
a
sphere
whose
diameter
was
a
little
more
than
that
of
the
former
the
light
reflected
from
their
surfaces
was
of
silver
radiance
rather
than
the
golden
hue
of
the
moon
or
of
venus
as
seen
through
a
small
telescope
the
smaller
crescent
i
could
recognise
at
once
as
belonging
to
our
own
satellite
the
larger
was
of
course
the
world
i
had
quitted
so
exactly
is
the
clockwork
or
its
substitute
adapted
to
counteract
both
the
rotation
and
revolution
of
mars
that
the
two
images
underwent
no
other
change
of
place
than
that
caused
by
their
own
proper
motion
in
space
a
movement
which
notwithstanding
the
immense
magnifying
power
employed
was
of
course
scarcely
perceptible
but
the
rotation
of
the
larger
sphere
was
visible
as
we
watched
it
it
so
happened
that
the
part
which
was
at
once
lighted
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
exposed
to
our
observation
was
but
little
clouded
the
atmosphere
of
course
prevented
its
presenting
the
clear
outlines
of
lunar
landscapes
but
sea
and
land
ice
and
snow
were
so
clearly
defined
and
easily
distinguishable
that
my
companions
exclaimed
with
eagerness
as
they
observed
features
unmistakably
resembling
on
the
grand
scale
those
with
which
they
were
themselves
familiar
the
arctic
ice
was
scarcely
visible
in
the
north
the
vast
steppes
of
russia
the
boundary
line
of
the
ural
mountains
the
of
the
euxine
western
asia
arabia
and
the
red
sea
joining
the
long
of
the
southern
ocean
were
defined
by
the
slanting
rays
the
antarctic
was
almost
equally
clear
with
its
stupendous
glacier
masses
radiating
apparently
from
an
elevated
extensive
land
chiefly
consisting
of
a
deeply
scooped
and
scored
plateau
of
rock
around
the
pole
itself
the
terminator
or
boundary
between
light
and
shade
was
not
as
in
the
moon
pretty
sharply
defined
and
broken
only
by
the
mountainous
masses
rings
and
if
such
they
are
so
characteristic
of
the
latter
on
the
image
of
the
moon
there
intervened
between
bright
light
and
utter
darkness
but
the
narrow
belt
to
which
only
part
of
the
sun
was
as
yet
visible
and
which
therefore
received
comparatively
few
rays
the
twilight
to
north
and
south
extended
on
the
image
of
the
earth
deep
into
that
part
on
which
as
yet
the
sun
was
below
the
horizon
and
consequently
daylight
faded
into
darkness
all
but
imperceptibly
save
between
the
tropics
we
watched
long
and
intently
as
league
by
league
new
portions
of
europe
and
africa
the
mediterranean
and
even
the
baltic
came
into
view
and
i
was
able
to
point
out
to
eveena
lands
in
which
i
had
traveller
seas
i
had
crossed
and
even
the
isles
of
the
aegean
and
bays
in
which
my
vessel
had
lain
at
anchor
this
personal
introduction
to
each
part
of
the
image
now
presented
to
her
for
the
first
time
enabled
her
to
realise
more
forcibly
than
a
lengthened
experience
of
astronomical
observation
might
have
done
the
likeness
to
her
own
world
of
that
which
was
passing
under
her
eyes
and
at
once
intensified
her
wonder
heightened
her
pleasure
and
sharpened
her
intellectual
apprehension
of
the
scene
when
we
had
satiated
our
eyes
with
this
spectacle
or
rather
when
i
remembered
that
we
could
spare
no
more
time
to
this
the
most
interesting
exhibition
of
the
evening
a
turn
of
the
machinery
brought
venus
under
view
here
however
the
cloud
envelope
baffled
us
altogether
and
her
close
approach
to
the
horizon
soon
obliged
the
director
to
turn
his
apparatus
in
another
direction
two
or
three
of
the
asteroids
were
in
view
pallas
especially
presented
a
very
interesting
spectacle
not
that
the
difference
of
distance
would
have
rendered
the
definition
much
more
perfect
than
from
a
terrestrial
standpoint
but
that
the
marvellous
perfection
of
martial
instruments
and
in
some
measure
also
the
rarity
of
the
atmosphere
at
such
a
height
rendered
possible
the
use
of
far
higher
magnifying
powers
than
our
astronomers
can
employ
i
am
inclined
to
agree
from
what
i
saw
on
this
occasion
with
those
who
imagine
the
asteroids
to
be
if
not
fragments
of
a
broken
planet
which
once
existed
as
a
whole
yet
in
another
sense
fragmentary
spheres
less
perfect
and
with
surfaces
of
much
greater
proportionate
irregularity
than
those
of
the
larger
planets
next
was
presented
to
our
view
on
a
somewhat
smaller
scale
because
the
area
of
the
chamber
employed
would
not
otherwise
have
given
room
for
the
system
the
enormous
disc
and
the
four
satellites
of
jupiter
the
difference
between
and
millions
of
miles
distance
is
of
course
wholly
unimportant
but
the
definition
and
enlargement
were
such
that
the
image
was
perfect
and
the
details
minute
and
distinct
beyond
anything
that
earthly
observation
had
led
me
to
conceive
as
possible
the
satellites
were
no
longer
mere
points
or
tiny
discs
but
distinct
moons
with
surfaces
marked
like
that
of
our
own
satellite
though
far
less
mountainous
and
broken
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
possessing
a
distinct
atmosphere
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
not
a
visible
difference
of
brightness
among
them
not
due
to
their
size
but
to
some
difference
in
the
reflecting
power
of
their
surfaces
since
the
distance
of
all
from
the
sun
is
practically
equal
that
jupiter
gives
out
some
light
of
his
own
a
portion
of
which
they
may
possibly
reflect
in
differing
amount
according
to
their
varying
distance
is
believed
by
martial
astronomers
and
i
thought
it
not
improbable
the
brilliant
and
various
colouring
of
the
bands
which
cross
the
face
of
the
giant
planet
was
wonderfully
brought
out
the
around
the
poles
the
clear
light
of
the
light
bands
probably
belts
of
white
cloud
contrasted
signally
the
hues
varying
from
deep
to
what
was
almost
crimson
or
on
the
one
hand
and
bright
yellow
on
the
other
of
different
zones
of
the
dark
belts
on
the
latter
markings
and
streaks
of
strange
variety
suggested
if
they
prove
the
existence
of
frequent
spiral
storms
disturbing
probably
at
an
immense
height
above
the
surface
clouds
which
must
be
utterly
unlike
the
clouds
of
mars
or
the
earth
in
material
as
well
as
in
form
and
mass
these
markings
enabled
us
to
follow
with
clear
ocular
appreciation
the
rapid
rotation
of
this
planet
in
the
course
of
several
distinct
spots
on
different
belts
had
moved
in
a
direct
line
across
a
tenth
of
the
face
presented
to
us
a
distance
upon
the
scale
of
the
gigantic
image
so
great
that
the
motion
required
no
painstaking
observation
but
forced
itself
upon
the
notice
of
the
least
attentive
spectator
the
belief
of
martial
astronomers
is
that
jupiter
is
not
by
any
means
so
much
less
dense
than
the
minor
planets
as
his
proportionately
lesser
weight
would
imply
they
hold
that
his
visible
surface
is
that
of
an
enormously
deep
atmosphere
within
which
lies
they
suppose
a
central
ball
not
merely
hot
but
more
than
white
hot
and
probably
from
its
temperature
not
yet
possessing
a
solid
crust
one
writer
argues
that
since
all
worlds
must
by
analogy
be
supposed
to
be
inhabited
and
since
the
satellites
of
jupiter
more
resemble
worlds
than
the
planet
itself
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
kind
of
secondary
sun
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
former
are
the
scenes
of
life
as
varied
as
that
of
mars
itself
and
that
infinite
ages
hence
when
these
have
become
too
cold
for
habitation
their
giant
primary
may
have
gone
through
those
processes
which
according
to
the
received
theory
have
fitted
the
interior
planets
to
be
the
home
of
plants
animals
and
in
two
cases
at
least
of
human
beings
it
was
near
midnight
before
the
manifest
fatigue
of
the
ladies
overcame
my
selfish
desire
to
prolong
as
much
as
possible
this
most
interesting
visit
meteorological
science
in
mars
has
been
carried
to
high
perfection
and
the
director
warned
me
that
but
three
or
four
equally
favourable
opportunities
might
offer
in
the
course
of
the
next
half
year
chapter
xxiii
characteristics
time
passed
on
marked
by
no
very
important
incident
while
i
made
acquaintance
with
manners
and
with
men
around
me
neither
one
nor
the
other
worth
further
description
nothing
occurred
to
confirm
the
alarms
davilo
constantly
repeated
i
called
the
ladies
one
day
into
the
outer
grounds
to
see
a
new
carriage
capable
according
to
its
arrangement
of
containing
from
two
to
eight
persons
and
a
balloon
of
great
size
and
new
construction
which
davilo
had
urgently
counselled
me
to
procure
as
capable
of
sudden
use
in
some
of
those
daily
thickening
perils
of
which
i
could
see
no
other
sign
than
occasional
evidence
that
my
steps
were
watched
and
dogged
both
vehicles
enlisted
the
interest
and
curiosity
of
eunané
and
her
companions
eveena
after
examining
with
as
much
attention
as
was
due
to
the
trouble
i
took
to
explain
it
the
construction
of
the
carriage
concentrated
her
interest
and
observation
upon
the
balloon
the
sight
of
which
evidently
impressed
her
when
we
had
returned
to
the
peristyle
and
the
rest
had
dispersed
i
said
i
see
you
apprehend
some
part
of
my
reasons
for
purchasing
the
balloon
the
carriage
will
take
us
to
altasfe
a
town
some
ten
miles
distant
is
an
amusement
so
gratifying
to
all
women
on
earth
from
the
veiled
favourites
of
an
eastern
seraglio
to
the
very
unveiled
dames
of
western
ballrooms
that
i
suppose
the
instinct
must
be
native
to
the
sex
wherever
women
and
trade
if
you
have
a
single
feminine
folly
you
will
enjoy
this
more
than
you
will
own
if
you
are
as
they
complain
absolutely
faultless
you
will
enjoy
with
me
the
pleasure
of
the
girls
in
plaguing
one
after
another
all
the
traders
of
altasfe
and
with
these
words
i
placed
in
her
hands
a
packet
of
the
thin
metallic
plates
constituting
their
currency
her
extreme
and
unaffected
surprise
was
amusing
to
witness
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
she
inquired
counting
carefully
the
uncounted
pile
in
a
manner
which
at
once
dispelled
my
impression
that
her
surprise
was
due
to
childish
ignorance
of
its
value
whatever
you
please
madonna
whatever
can
please
you
and
the
others
but
she
remonstrated
this
is
more
than
all
our
dowries
for
another
year
to
come
and
forgive
me
for
repeating
what
you
seem
purposely
to
forget
i
can
not
cast
the
shadow
between
my
equals
and
the
master
would
you
so
mortify
as
to
make
me
take
from
hand
for
example
what
should
come
from
yours
you
are
right
madonna
now
as
always
i
owned
wincing
at
the
name
she
used
invariably
employed
by
the
others
but
one
i
never
endured
from
her
her
looks
entreated
pardon
for
the
form
of
the
implied
reproof
as
i
resumed
the
larger
part
of
the
money
she
held
out
to
me
forcing
back
the
smaller
into
her
reluctant
hands
but
what
has
the
amount
of
your
dowries
to
do
with
the
matter
the
contracts
are
meant
i
suppose
to
secure
the
least
to
which
a
wife
has
a
right
not
to
fix
her
natural
share
in
her
husband
wealth
you
need
not
fear
eveena
the
prince
has
made
us
rich
enough
to
spend
more
than
we
shall
care
for
i
do
understand
you
she
replied
with
her
usual
gentle
frankness
and
simple
logical
consistency
it
pleases
you
to
say
and
whenever
you
can
so
seem
to
make
me
part
of
yourself
and
i
love
to
hear
you
for
it
assures
me
each
time
that
you
still
hold
me
tightly
as
i
cling
to
you
but
you
know
those
are
only
words
of
kindness
since
you
returned
my
father
gift
the
dowry
you
then
doubled
is
my
only
share
of
what
is
yours
and
it
is
more
than
enough
do
you
mean
that
women
expect
and
receive
no
more
that
they
do
not
naturally
share
in
a
man
surplus
wealth
while
i
spoke
enva
had
joined
us
and
resting
on
the
cushions
at
my
feet
looked
curiously
at
the
metallic
notes
in
eveena
hand
you
do
not
returned
the
latter
pay
more
foe
what
you
have
purchased
because
you
have
grown
richer
you
do
not
share
your
wealth
even
with
those
on
whose
care
it
chiefly
depends
yes
i
do
eveena
but
i
know
what
you
mean
their
share
is
settled
and
is
not
increased
but
you
will
not
tell
me
that
this
affords
any
standard
for
household
dealings
that
a
wife
share
in
her
fortune
is
really
bounded
by
the
terms
of
the
marriage
contract
will
you
let
enva
answer
you
asked
eveena
she
looks
more
ready
than
i
feel
to
reply
this
little
incident
was
characteristic
in
more
ways
than
one
eveena
feelings
growing
out
of
the
realities
of
our
relation
were
at
issue
with
and
perplexed
her
convictions
founded
on
the
theory
and
practice
of
her
world
not
yet
doubting
the
justice
of
the
latter
she
instinctively
shrank
from
their
application
to
ourselves
she
was
glad
therefore
to
let
enva
state
plainly
and
directly
a
doctrine
which
from
her
own
lips
would
have
pained
as
well
as
startled
me
on
her
side
enva
though
encouraged
to
bear
her
part
in
conversation
was
too
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
same
ideas
to
interpose
unbidden
as
she
would
have
said
a
wife
deserved
the
sandal
for
speaking
without
leave
nor
experience
notwithstanding
would
she
think
it
safe
to
interrupt
in
my
presence
a
favourite
so
pointedly
honoured
as
eveena
waited
therefore
till
my
eyes
gave
the
permission
which
hers
had
asked
why
should
you
buy
anything
twice
over
clasfempta
whether
it
be
a
wife
or
an
ambâ
a
girl
sells
her
society
for
the
best
price
her
attractions
will
command
these
attractions
seldom
increase
you
can
not
give
her
less
because
you
care
less
for
them
but
how
can
she
expect
more
i
know
enva
that
the
marriage
contract
here
is
an
open
bargain
and
sale
as
among
my
race
it
is
generally
a
veiled
one
but
the
bargain
made
does
it
really
govern
the
after
relation
do
men
really
spend
their
wealth
wholly
on
themselves
and
take
no
pleasure
in
the
pleasure
of
women
generally
i
believe
enva
replied
they
fancy
they
have
paid
too
much
for
their
toy
before
they
have
possessed
it
long
and
had
rather
buy
a
new
one
than
make
much
of
those
they
have
wives
seldom
look
on
the
increase
of
a
man
wealth
as
a
gain
to
themselves
of
course
you
like
to
see
us
prettily
dressed
while
you
think
us
worth
looking
at
in
ourselves
but
as
a
rule
our
own
income
provides
for
that
and
at
any
rate
are
better
off
than
almost
any
women
outside
the
palace
the
prince
did
not
care
and
knew
it
would
not
matter
to
you
what
he
gave
to
make
his
gift
worthy
of
him
and
agreeable
to
you
perhaps
she
added
he
wished
to
make
it
secure
by
offering
terms
too
good
to
be
thrown
away
by
any
foolish
rebellion
against
a
heavier
hand
or
a
worse
temper
than
usual
you
hardly
understand
yet
half
the
advantages
you
possess
the
latent
sarcasm
of
the
last
remark
did
not
need
the
look
of
pretended
fear
that
pointed
it
if
enva
professed
to
resent
my
inadequate
appreciation
of
the
splendid
beauty
bestowed
on
me
by
the
royal
favour
more
than
any
possible
for
which
she
supposed
herself
compensated
in
advance
it
was
not
for
me
to
put
her
sincerity
to
proof
once
bought
then
wives
are
not
worth
pleasing
it
is
not
worth
while
to
purchase
happy
faces
bright
smiles
and
willing
kisses
now
and
then
at
a
cost
the
giver
can
scarcely
feel
enva
look
now
was
half
malicious
half
kindly
and
wholly
comical
but
she
answered
gravely
with
a
slight
imitation
of
my
own
tone
can
you
not
imagine
or
make
eveena
tell
you
clasfempta
why
women
once
purchased
think
it
best
to
give
smiles
and
kisses
freely
to
one
who
can
command
their
tears
or
do
you
fancy
that
their
smiles
are
more
loyal
and
sincere
when
won
by
kindness
than
by
fear
sweeter
enva
at
any
rate
well
if
i
do
not
offend
your
feelings
i
need
not
hesitate
to
disregard
another
of
your
customs
she
received
her
share
willingly
and
gratefully
enough
but
her
smile
and
kiss
were
so
evidently
given
to
order
that
they
only
testified
to
the
thorough
literality
of
her
statement
leenoo
eiralé
and
elfé
followed
her
example
with
characteristic
exactness
equally
characteristic
was
the
conduct
of
the
others
eunané
kept
aloof
till
called
and
then
approached
with
an
air
of
sullen
reluctance
as
if
summoned
to
receive
a
reprimand
rather
than
a
favour
not
a
little
amused
i
affected
displeasure
in
my
turn
till
the
window
of
her
chamber
closed
behind
us
and
her
was
forgotten
in
wondering
alarm
offered
in
private
the
kiss
and
smile
given
and
not
demanded
the
present
was
accepted
with
frank
affectionate
gratitude
eivé
took
her
share
in
pettish
shyness
waiting
the
moment
when
she
might
mingle
unobserved
with
her
childlike
caresses
the
childish
reproach
if
you
can
buy
kisses
clasfempta
you
do
want
mine
and
if
you
fancy
i
sell
them
you
shall
have
no
more
i
saw
davilo
in
the
morning
before
we
started
after
some
conversation
on
business
he
said
and
pardon
a
suggestion
which
i
make
not
as
in
charge
of
your
affairs
but
as
responsible
to
our
supreme
authority
for
your
safety
no
correspondence
should
pass
from
your
household
unscrutinised
and
if
there
be
such
correspondence
i
must
ask
you
to
place
in
my
hand
for
the
purpose
of
our
quest
not
any
message
but
some
of
the
slips
on
which
messages
have
been
written
this
may
probably
furnish
precisely
that
tangible
means
of
relation
with
some
one
acquainted
with
the
conspiracy
for
which
we
have
sought
in
vain
my
unwillingness
to
meddle
with
feminine
correspondence
was
the
less
intelligible
to
him
that
as
the
master
alone
commands
the
household
telegraph
he
knew
that
it
must
have
passed
through
my
hands
i
yielded
at
last
to
his
repeated
urgency
that
a
life
more
precious
than
mine
was
involved
in
any
danger
to
myself
so
far
as
to
promise
the
slips
required
to
furnish
a
possible
means
of
between
the
and
the
enemy
i
returned
to
the
house
in
grave
thought
eunané
corresponded
by
the
telegraph
with
some
schoolmates
eivé
i
fancied
with
three
or
four
of
those
ladies
with
whom
accompanying
me
on
my
visits
she
had
made
acquaintance
but
i
hated
the
very
thought
of
domestic
suspicion
and
adhering
to
my
original
resolve
refused
to
entertain
a
distrust
that
seemed
and
if
there
had
been
treachery
it
would
be
impossible
to
obtain
any
letters
that
might
have
been
preserved
without
resorting
to
a
compulsion
which
since
both
eunané
and
eivé
had
written
in
the
knowledge
that
their
letters
passed
unread
would
seem
like
a
breach
of
faith
i
asked
however
simply
and
giving
no
reason
for
the
production
of
any
papers
received
and
preserved
by
either
eivé
with
her
usual
air
of
simplicity
brought
me
the
two
or
three
which
she
said
were
all
she
had
kept
eunané
replied
with
a
petulance
almost
amounting
to
refusal
which
to
some
might
have
suggested
suspicion
but
which
to
me
seemed
the
very
last
course
that
a
culprit
would
have
pursued
to
give
needless
offence
while
conscious
of
guilt
would
have
been
the
very
wantonness
of
reckless
temper
bite
your
tongue
and
keep
your
letters
i
said
sharply
turning
to
eivé
and
looking
at
the
addresses
of
hers
none
of
which
bore
the
name
of
any
one
who
could
be
suspected
of
the
remotest
connection
with
a
political
plot
give
me
which
of
these
you
please
i
said
taking
from
her
hand
that
which
she
selected
and
marking
it
now
erase
the
writing
yourself
and
give
me
the
paper
this
incident
gave
eunané
leisure
to
recover
her
temper
she
stood
for
a
few
moments
ashamed
perhaps
but
as
usual
resolute
to
abide
by
the
consequences
of
a
fault
when
she
found
that
my
last
word
was
spoken
her
mood
changed
at
once
i
did
not
quite
like
to
give
you
velna
letters
they
are
foolish
like
mine
and
besides
but
i
never
supposed
you
would
let
me
refuse
what
you
wo
make
me
do
i
must
do
of
my
own
accord
womanly
reasoning
most
unlike
woman
reasons
she
brought
with
unaffected
alacrity
a
collection
of
whose
addresses
bore
out
her
account
of
their
character
taking
the
last
from
the
bundle
i
bade
her
erase
its
contents
no
she
said
that
is
the
one
i
least
liked
to
show
if
you
will
not
read
it
please
follow
my
hand
as
i
read
and
see
for
yourself
how
far
i
have
misused
your
trust
i
never
doubted
your
good
faith
eunané
but
she
had
begun
to
read
pointing
with
her
finger
as
she
went
on
at
one
sentence
hand
and
voice
wavered
a
little
without
apparent
reason
i
shall
wrote
her
some
half
year
her
junior
make
my
appearance
at
the
next
inspection
i
wish
the
camptâ
had
left
you
here
till
now
we
might
perhaps
have
contrived
to
pass
into
the
same
household
a
very
innocent
wish
and
very
natural
i
said
in
answer
to
the
look
half
inquiring
half
shy
with
which
eunané
watched
the
effect
of
her
words
i
could
not
now
use
the
precaution
in
her
case
which
it
had
somehow
seemed
natural
to
adopt
with
eivé
of
marking
the
paper
returned
for
erasure
on
her
part
eunané
thrust
into
my
hand
the
whole
bundle
as
they
were
and
i
was
forced
myself
to
erase
by
an
process
which
leaves
no
trace
of
writing
the
words
of
that
selected
the
absence
of
any
mark
on
the
second
paper
served
sufficiently
to
distinguish
the
two
when
of
course
without
stating
from
whom
i
received
them
i
placed
them
in
davilo
hands
when
we
were
ready
to
leave
the
peristyle
for
the
carriage
i
observed
that
eunané
alone
was
still
unveiled
while
the
others
wore
their
cloaks
of
down
and
the
thick
veils
without
which
no
lady
may
present
herself
to
the
public
eye
time
is
woman
crime
i
said
quoting
a
domestic
proverb
in
another
household
you
would
be
left
behind
of
course
she
replied
such
summary
discipline
seeming
to
her
as
appropriate
as
to
an
european
child
i
do
like
always
to
deserve
the
vine
and
receive
the
nuts
you
must
take
which
like
i
retorted
laughing
satisfied
or
silenced
she
hastened
to
dress
and
enjoyed
with
unalloyed
delight
the
unusual
pleasure
of
inspecting
dresses
and
jewellery
and
making
more
purchases
in
a
day
than
she
had
expected
to
be
able
to
do
in
two
years
but
she
and
her
companions
acted
with
more
consideration
than
ladies
permitted
to
visit
the
shops
of
europe
show
for
their
masculine
escort
eivé
alone
on
this
as
on
other
occasions
availed
herself
thoroughly
of
those
privileges
of
childhood
which
i
had
always
extended
to
her
so
quick
are
the
proceedings
and
so
excellent
the
arrangements
of
martial
commerce
even
where
ladies
are
concerned
that
a
couple
of
hours
saw
us
on
our
way
homeward
after
having
passed
through
the
apartments
of
half
the
merchants
in
altasfe
purposely
for
my
own
pleasure
as
well
as
for
that
of
my
companions
i
took
a
circuitous
route
homeward
and
in
so
doing
came
within
sight
of
a
principal
feminine
nursery
or
girls
school
recognising
it
eunané
spoke
with
some
eagerness
ah
i
spent
nine
years
there
and
not
always
unhappily
eveena
who
sat
beside
me
pressed
my
hand
with
an
intention
easily
understood
and
you
would
like
to
see
it
again
i
inquired
in
compliance
with
her
silent
hint
not
to
go
back
said
eunané
but
i
should
like
to
pay
it
a
visit
if
it
were
possible
can
we
i
asked
eveena
i
think
so
she
answered
i
observe
half
a
dozen
people
have
gone
in
since
we
came
in
sight
and
i
fancy
it
is
inspection
day
there
inspection
i
asked
yes
she
replied
in
a
tone
of
some
little
annoyance
and
discomfort
the
girls
who
have
completed
their
tenth
year
and
who
are
thought
to
have
as
good
a
chance
now
as
they
would
have
later
are
dressed
for
the
first
time
in
the
white
robe
and
veil
of
maidenhood
and
presented
in
the
public
chamber
to
attract
the
choice
of
those
who
are
looking
for
brides
not
a
pleasant
spectacle
i
said
to
you
or
to
myself
but
it
will
hardly
annoy
the
others
and
eunané
shall
have
her
wish
we
descended
from
our
carriage
at
the
gate
and
entered
the
grounds
of
the
nursery
studiously
as
the
health
the
diet
and
the
exercise
of
the
inmates
are
cared
for
nothing
is
done
to
render
the
appearance
of
the
home
where
they
pass
so
large
and
critical
a
portion
of
their
lives
cheerful
or
attractive
in
appearance
utility
alone
is
studied
how
much
beauty
conduces
to
utility
where
the
happiness
and
health
of
children
are
concerned
martial
science
has
yet
to
learn
the
grounds
contained
no
flowers
and
but
few
trees
the
latter
ruined
in
point
of
form
and
natural
grace
to
render
them
convenient
supports
for
gymnastic
apparatus
a
number
of
the
younger
girls
unveiled
but
dressed
in
a
dark
plain
garment
reaching
from
the
throat
to
the
knees
with
trousers
giving
free
play
to
the
limbs
were
exercising
on
the
different
swings
and
bars
flinging
the
light
weights
and
balls
or
handling
the
substitutes
for
the
use
of
which
forms
an
important
branch
of
their
education
others
relieved
from
this
essential
part
of
their
tasks
were
engaged
in
various
sports
one
of
these
i
noticed
especially
perhaps
a
hundred
young
ladies
on
either
side
formed
a
sort
of
battalion
contending
for
the
ground
they
occupied
with
light
shields
of
closely
woven
wire
and
masks
of
the
same
material
and
with
spears
consisting
of
a
reed
or
grass
about
five
feet
in
length
and
exceedingly
light
when
perfectly
ripened
these
spears
are
exceeding
formidable
their
points
being
sharp
enough
to
pierce
the
skin
of
any
but
a
pachydermatous
animal
those
employed
in
these
games
however
are
gathered
while
yet
covered
by
a
sheath
which
as
they
ripen
bursts
and
leaves
the
keen
hard
point
exposed
considerable
care
is
taken
in
their
selection
since
if
nearly
ripe
or
if
they
should
ripen
prematurely
under
the
heat
of
the
sun
when
severed
from
the
stem
the
sheath
bursting
in
the
middle
of
a
game
very
grave
accidents
might
occur
the
movements
of
the
girls
were
so
ordered
that
the
game
appeared
almost
as
much
a
dance
as
a
conflict
but
though
there
was
nothing
of
unseemly
violence
the
victory
was
evidently
contested
with
real
earnestness
and
with
a
skill
superior
to
that
displayed
in
the
movements
of
the
actual
soldiers
who
have
long
since
exchanged
the
tasks
of
warfare
for
the
duties
of
policemen
escorts
and
sentries
i
held
eveena
hand
the
others
followed
us
closely
venturing
neither
to
break
from
our
party
without
leave
nor
to
ask
permission
till
at
eveena
suggestion
it
was
spontaneously
given
they
then
quitted
us
hastening
eunané
to
seek
out
her
favourite
companions
of
a
former
season
the
others
to
mingle
with
the
younger
girls
and
share
in
their
play
we
walked
on
slowly
stopping
from
time
to
time
to
watch
the
exercises
and
sports
of
the
younger
portion
of
a
community
numbering
some
fifteen
hundred
girls
when
we
entered
the
hall
we
were
rejoined
by
eunané
with
one
of
her
friends
who
still
wore
the
ordinary
school
costume
conversation
with
or
notice
of
a
young
lady
so
dressed
was
not
only
not
expected
but
disallowed
and
the
pair
seated
themselves
behind
us
and
studiously
out
of
hearing
of
any
conversation
conducted
in
a
low
tone
the
spectacle
as
i
had
anticipated
was
to
me
anything
but
pleasant
it
reminded
me
of
a
of
the
east
however
rather
than
of
the
more
revolting
features
of
a
slave
auction
in
the
united
states
the
maidens
most
of
them
very
graceful
and
more
than
pretty
their
robes
arranged
and
ornamented
with
an
evident
care
to
set
off
their
persons
to
the
best
advantage
and
with
a
skill
much
greater
than
they
themselves
could
yet
have
acquired
were
seated
alone
or
by
twos
and
threes
in
different
parts
of
the
hall
grouped
so
as
to
produce
the
most
attractive
general
as
well
as
individual
effect
the
picture
therefore
was
a
pretty
one
and
since
the
intending
purchasers
addressed
the
objects
of
their
curiosity
or
admiration
with
courtesy
and
fairly
decorous
reserve
it
was
the
known
character
rather
than
any
visible
incident
of
the
scene
that
rendered
it
repugnant
or
revolting
in
my
eyes
i
need
not
say
that
except
eveena
there
was
no
one
of
either
sex
in
the
hall
who
shared
my
feeling
after
all
the
purpose
was
but
frankly
avowed
and
certainly
carried
out
more
safely
and
decorously
than
in
the
and
of
london
or
paris
of
the
maidens
some
seemed
shy
and
backward
and
most
were
silent
save
when
addressed
but
the
majority
received
their
suitors
with
a
thoroughly
air
and
listened
to
the
terms
offered
them
or
endeavoured
to
exact
a
higher
price
or
a
briefer
period
of
assured
slavery
with
a
more
reasonable
than
agreeable
to
witness
one
maiden
seated
in
our
immediate
vicinity
was
i
perceived
the
object
of
eveena
especial
interest
and
at
first
on
this
account
alone
attracted
my
observation
dressed
with
somewhat
less
ostentatious
care
and
elegance
than
her
companions
her
veil
and
the
skirt
of
her
robe
were
so
arranged
as
to
show
less
of
her
personal
attractions
than
they
generally
displayed
a
first
glance
hardly
did
justice
to
a
countenance
which
if
not
signally
pretty
and
certainly
marked
by
a
beauty
less
striking
than
that
of
most
of
the
others
was
modest
and
pleasing
a
figure
slight
and
graceful
with
hands
and
feet
yet
smaller
than
usual
even
among
a
race
the
shape
of
whose
limbs
is
with
few
exceptions
admirable
very
few
had
addressed
her
or
even
looked
at
her
and
a
certain
resigned
mortification
was
visible
in
her
countenance
you
are
sorry
for
that
child
i
said
to
eveena
yes
she
answered
it
must
be
distressing
to
feel
herself
the
least
attractive
the
least
noticed
among
her
companions
and
on
such
an
occasion
i
can
not
conceive
how
i
could
bear
to
form
part
of
such
a
spectacle
but
if
i
were
in
her
place
i
suppose
i
should
be
hurt
and
humbled
at
finding
that
nobody
cared
to
look
at
me
in
the
presence
of
others
prettier
and
better
dressed
than
myself
well
i
said
of
all
the
faces
i
see
i
like
that
the
best
i
suppose
i
must
not
speak
to
her
why
not
said
eveena
in
surprise
you
are
not
bound
to
purchase
her
any
more
than
we
bought
all
we
looked
at
it
did
not
occur
to
me
i
replied
that
i
could
be
regarded
as
a
possible
suitor
nor
do
i
think
i
could
find
courage
to
present
myself
to
that
young
lady
in
a
manner
which
must
cause
her
to
look
upon
me
in
that
light
ask
eunané
if
she
knows
her
here
eivé
and
the
others
joined
us
and
took
their
places
on
my
right
eveena
leaving
her
seat
for
a
moment
spoke
apart
with
eunané
will
you
speak
to
her
she
said
returning
she
is
eunané
friend
and
correspondent
velna
and
i
think
they
are
really
fond
of
each
other
it
is
a
pity
that
if
she
is
to
undergo
the
mortification
of
remaining
unchosen
and
going
back
to
her
tasks
at
least
till
the
next
inspection
she
will
also
be
separated
finally
from
the
only
person
for
whom
she
seems
to
have
had
anything
like
home
affection
well
if
i
am
to
talk
to
her
i
replied
you
must
be
good
enough
to
accompany
me
i
do
not
feel
that
i
could
venture
on
such
an
enterprise
by
myself
eveena
eyes
even
through
her
veil
expressed
at
once
amusement
and
surprise
but
as
she
rose
to
accompany
me
this
expression
faded
and
a
look
of
graver
interest
replaced
it
many
turned
to
observe
us
as
we
crossed
the
short
space
that
separated
us
from
the
isolated
and
neglected
maiden
i
had
seen
if
i
had
not
noticed
that
in
no
case
were
the
men
as
they
made
the
tour
of
the
room
or
went
up
to
any
lady
who
might
have
attracted
their
special
notice
accompanied
by
the
women
of
their
households
a
few
of
these
however
sat
watching
the
scene
their
mortification
curiosity
jealousy
or
whatever
feeling
it
might
excite
being
of
course
concealed
by
the
veils
that
hid
every
feature
but
the
eyes
which
now
and
then
followed
very
closely
the
footsteps
of
their
lords
the
object
of
our
attention
showed
marked
surprise
as
we
approached
her
and
yet
more
when
seeing
that
i
was
at
a
loss
for
words
eveena
herself
spoke
a
kindly
and
gracious
sentence
the
girl
voice
was
soft
and
low
and
her
tone
and
words
as
we
gradually
fell
into
a
hesitating
and
broken
conversation
confirmed
the
impression
made
by
her
appearance
when
after
a
few
minutes
i
moved
to
depart
there
was
in
eveena
reluctant
steps
and
expressive
upturned
eyes
a
meaning
i
could
not
understand
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
hearing
moving
so
as
partly
to
hide
my
countenance
and
entirely
to
conceal
her
own
gesture
from
the
object
of
her
compassion
she
checked
my
steps
by
a
gentle
pressure
on
my
arm
and
looked
up
earnestly
into
my
face
what
is
it
i
asked
you
seem
to
have
some
wish
that
i
can
not
conjecture
and
you
can
trust
by
this
time
my
anxiety
to
gratify
every
desire
of
yours
reasonable
or
not
if
indeed
you
ever
were
unreasonable
she
is
so
sad
so
lonely
eveena
answered
and
she
is
so
fond
of
eunané
you
do
mean
that
you
want
me
to
make
her
an
offer
i
exclaimed
in
extreme
amazement
do
not
be
angry
pleaded
eveena
she
would
be
glad
to
accept
any
offer
you
would
be
likely
to
make
and
the
money
you
gave
me
yesterday
would
have
paid
all
she
would
cost
you
for
many
years
besides
it
would
please
eunané
and
it
would
make
velna
so
happy
you
must
know
far
better
than
i
can
what
is
likely
to
make
her
happy
i
replied
strange
to
the
ideas
and
customs
of
your
world
i
can
not
conceive
that
a
woman
can
wish
to
take
the
last
place
in
a
household
like
ours
rather
than
the
first
or
only
one
with
the
poorest
of
her
people
she
will
hardly
have
the
choice
eveena
answered
those
whom
you
can
call
poor
mostly
wait
till
they
can
have
their
choice
before
they
marry
and
if
taken
by
some
one
who
could
not
afford
a
more
expensive
choice
she
would
only
be
neglected
or
dismissed
ill
provided
for
as
soon
as
he
could
purchase
one
more
to
his
taste
if
i
rejoined
at
last
you
think
it
a
kindness
to
her
and
are
sure
she
will
so
think
it
if
you
wish
it
and
will
avouch
her
contentment
with
a
place
in
the
household
of
one
who
does
not
desire
her
i
will
comply
with
this
as
with
any
wish
of
yours
but
it
is
not
to
my
mind
to
take
a
wife
out
of
mere
compassion
as
i
might
readily
adopt
a
child
once
more
with
all
our
mutual
affection
and
appreciation
of
each
other
character
eveena
and
i
were
far
as
the
poles
apart
in
thought
if
not
in
feeling
it
was
as
impossible
for
her
to
emancipate
herself
utterly
from
the
ideas
and
habits
of
her
own
world
as
for
me
to
reconcile
myself
to
them
i
led
her
back
at
last
to
her
seat
and
beckoned
eunané
to
my
side
eveena
i
said
has
been
urging
me
to
offer
your
friend
yonder
a
place
in
our
household
though
i
could
not
see
her
face
the
instant
change
in
her
attitude
the
eager
movement
of
her
hands
and
the
elastic
spring
that
suddenly
braced
her
form
expressed
her
feeling
plainly
enough
it
must
be
done
i
suppose
i
murmured
rather
to
myself
than
to
them
as
eunané
timidly
put
out
her
hand
and
gratefully
clasped
eveena
well
it
is
to
be
done
for
you
and
you
must
do
it
how
can
i
exclaimed
eunané
in
astonishment
and
eveena
added
it
is
for
you
you
only
can
name
your
terms
and
it
would
be
a
strange
slight
to
her
to
do
so
through
us
i
can
not
help
that
i
will
not
the
lie
by
affecting
any
personal
desire
to
win
her
and
i
could
not
tell
her
the
truth
offer
her
the
same
terms
that
contented
the
rest
nay
if
she
enters
my
household
she
shall
not
feel
herself
in
a
secondary
or
inferior
position
this
condition
surprised
even
eveena
as
much
as
my
resolve
to
make
her
the
bearer
of
the
proposal
that
was
in
truth
her
own
but
however
reluctant
she
would
as
soon
have
refused
obedience
to
my
request
as
have
withheld
a
kindness
because
it
cost
her
an
unexpected
trial
taking
eunané
with
her
she
approached
and
addressed
the
girl
whatever
my
own
doubt
as
to
her
probable
reception
however
absurd
in
my
own
estimation
the
thing
i
was
induced
to
do
there
was
no
corresponding
consciousness
no
feeling
but
one
of
surprise
and
gratification
in
the
face
on
which
i
turned
my
eyes
there
was
a
short
and
earnest
debate
but
as
i
afterwards
learned
it
arose
simply
from
the
girl
astonishment
at
terms
which
extravagant
even
for
the
beauties
of
the
day
were
thrice
as
liberal
as
she
had
ventured
to
dream
of
eveena
and
eunané
were
as
well
aware
of
this
as
herself
the
right
of
beauty
to
a
special
price
seemed
to
them
as
obvious
as
in
western
europe
seems
the
right
of
rank
to
exorbitant
settlements
but
they
felt
it
as
impossible
to
argue
the
point
as
a
solicitor
would
find
it
unsafe
to
expound
to
a
the
different
cost
of
honouring
mademoiselle
with
his
hand
and
being
honoured
with
that
of
milady
velna
remonstrances
were
suppressed
she
rose
and
accompanied
by
eveena
and
eunané
approached
a
desk
in
one
corner
of
the
room
occupied
by
a
lady
past
middle
life
the
latter
like
all
those
of
her
sex
who
have
adopted
masculine
independence
and
a
professional
career
wore
no
veil
over
her
face
and
in
lieu
of
the
feminine
a
band
of
metal
around
the
head
depending
from
which
a
short
fall
of
silken
texture
drawn
back
behind
the
ears
covered
the
neck
and
upper
edge
of
the
dark
robe
this
lady
took
from
a
heap
by
her
side
a
slip
containing
the
usual
form
of
marriage
contract
and
filled
in
the
blanks
at
a
sign
from
eveena
i
had
by
this
time
approached
close
enough
to
hear
the
language
of
wonder
in
which
the
schoolmistress
congratulated
her
pupil
on
her
signal
conquest
and
the
terms
she
had
obtained
as
well
as
the
maiden
unaffected
acknowledgment
of
her
own
surprise
and
conscious
unworthiness
i
could
despite
the
concealment
of
her
form
and
face
eveena
silent
expression
of
pained
disgust
with
the
one
and
earnest
womanly
sympathy
with
the
other
the
document
was
executed
in
the
usual
triplicate
the
girl
retired
for
a
few
minutes
and
reappeared
in
a
cloak
and
veil
like
those
of
her
new
companions
but
of
comparatively
cheap
materials
as
we
passed
the
threshold
eveena
gently
and
tacitly
but
decisively
assigned
to
her
her
own
place
beside
me
and
put
her
right
hand
in
my
left
the
agitation
with
which
it
manifestly
trembled
though
neither
strange
nor
unpleasing
added
to
the
extreme
embarrassment
i
felt
and
i
had
placed
her
next
to
eunané
in
the
carriage
and
taken
my
seat
beside
eveena
whom
i
never
permitted
to
resign
her
own
before
a
single
spoken
word
had
passed
in
this
extraordinary
courtship
or
sanctioned
the
brief
and
practical
ceremony
of
marriage
i
was
alone
in
my
own
room
that
evening
when
a
gentle
scratching
on
the
entreated
admission
i
answered
without
looking
up
assuming
that
eveena
alone
would
seek
me
there
but
hers
were
not
the
lips
that
were
earnestly
pressed
on
my
hand
nor
hers
the
voice
that
spoke
trembling
and
hesitating
with
stronger
feeling
than
it
could
utter
in
words
i
do
thank
you
from
my
heart
i
little
thought
you
would
wish
to
make
me
so
happy
i
shrank
from
showing
you
the
letter
lest
you
should
think
i
dared
to
hope
it
is
not
only
velna
it
is
such
strange
joy
and
comfort
to
be
held
fast
by
one
who
cares
to
feel
safe
in
hands
as
kind
as
they
are
strong
you
said
you
could
love
none
save
eveena
but
clasfempta
your
way
of
not
loving
is
something
better
gentler
more
considerate
than
any
love
i
ever
hoped
or
heard
of
i
could
read
only
profound
sincerity
and
passionate
gratitude
in
the
clear
bright
eyes
softened
by
tears
that
looked
up
from
where
she
knelt
beside
me
but
the
exaggeration
was
painfully
suggestive
confirming
the
ugly
view
enva
had
given
yesterday
of
the
life
that
seemed
natural
and
reasonable
to
her
race
and
made
ordinary
human
kindness
appear
something
strange
and
romantic
by
contrast
surely
eunané
every
man
wishes
those
around
him
happy
if
it
do
not
cost
too
much
to
make
them
so
no
indeed
oftener
the
master
finds
pleasure
in
punishing
and
humiliating
the
favourite
in
witnessing
her
companions
tears
and
terror
they
like
to
see
the
household
grateful
for
an
amusement
crouching
to
caprice
incredulously
thankful
for
barest
justice
one
book
much
read
in
our
schools
says
that
is
a
stronger
earlier
and
more
tenacious
human
instinct
than
sympathy
and
another
that
the
pleasure
of
power
lies
in
giving
pain
and
half
the
remainder
in
being
praised
for
sparing
it
but
that
was
not
all
eveena
was
as
eager
to
be
kind
as
you
were
much
more
so
eunané
perhaps
what
seemed
natural
to
her
was
strange
to
you
but
it
was
thought
to
put
velna
on
equal
terms
with
us
taking
her
out
of
mere
kindness
to
give
her
the
dowry
of
a
prince
favourite
surprised
eveena
and
it
puzzled
me
but
i
think
i
half
understand
you
now
and
if
i
do
when
eveena
told
us
how
you
saved
her
and
defied
the
regent
and
eivé
asked
you
about
it
you
said
so
quietly
are
some
things
a
man
can
not
do
is
buying
a
girl
cheap
because
she
is
not
a
beauty
one
of
those
things
to
take
any
advantage
of
her
misfortune
to
make
her
feel
it
in
my
conduct
to
give
her
a
place
in
my
household
on
other
terms
than
her
equals
to
show
her
less
consideration
or
courtesy
than
one
would
give
to
a
girl
as
beautiful
as
yourself
yes
eunané
to
my
eyes
your
friend
is
pleasant
and
pretty
but
if
not
would
you
have
liked
to
feel
that
she
was
of
less
account
here
than
yourself
because
she
has
not
such
splendid
beauty
as
yours
eunané
was
too
frank
to
conceal
her
gratification
in
this
first
acknowledgment
of
her
charms
as
she
had
shown
her
mortification
while
it
was
withheld
not
certainly
because
undeserved
her
eyes
brightened
and
her
colour
deepened
in
manifest
pleasure
but
she
was
equally
frank
in
her
answer
to
the
implied
compliment
to
her
generosity
of
whose
justice
she
was
not
so
well
assured
i
am
afraid
i
should
half
have
liked
it
a
year
ago
now
after
i
have
lived
so
long
with
you
and
eveena
i
should
be
shamed
by
it
but
clasfempta
the
things
man
can
not
do
are
the
things
men
do
every
day
and
women
every
hour
chapter
xxiv
winter
hitherto
i
had
experienced
only
the
tropical
climate
of
mars
with
the
exception
of
the
short
time
spent
in
the
northern
temperate
zone
about
the
height
of
its
summer
i
was
anxious
of
course
to
see
something
also
of
its
winter
and
an
opportunity
presented
itself
no
institution
was
more
obviously
worth
a
visit
than
the
great
university
or
principal
place
of
highest
education
in
this
world
and
i
was
invited
thither
in
the
middle
of
the
local
winter
to
this
university
many
of
the
most
promising
youths
especially
those
intended
for
any
of
the
martial
professions
architects
artists
rulers
lawyers
physicians
and
so
forth
are
often
sent
directly
from
the
schools
or
after
a
short
period
of
training
in
the
higher
colleges
it
is
situate
far
within
the
north
temperate
zone
on
the
shore
of
one
of
the
longest
and
narrowest
of
the
great
martial
gulfs
which
extends
from
to
and
stretches
from
to
latitude
the
university
in
question
is
situate
nearly
at
the
extremity
of
the
northern
branch
of
this
gulf
which
splits
into
two
about
miles
from
its
end
a
canal
of
course
connecting
it
with
the
nearest
i
chose
to
perform
this
journey
by
land
following
the
line
of
the
great
road
from
amacasfe
to
qualveskinta
for
about
miles
and
then
turning
directly
northward
i
did
not
suppose
that
i
should
find
a
willing
companion
on
this
journey
and
was
myself
wishful
to
be
alone
since
i
dared
not
in
her
present
state
of
health
expose
eveena
to
the
fatigue
and
hardship
of
prolonged
winter
travelling
by
land
to
my
surprise
however
all
the
rest
when
aware
that
i
had
declined
to
take
her
were
eager
to
accompany
me
chiefly
to
take
her
out
of
the
way
and
certainly
with
no
idea
of
finding
pleasure
in
her
society
i
selected
enva
next
to
leenoo
the
most
malicious
of
the
party
and
gifted
with
sufficient
intelligence
to
render
her
malice
more
effective
than
leenoo
stupidity
could
be
enva
moreover
with
the
vigorous
youthful
often
found
on
earth
in
women
of
her
light
northern
complexion
seemed
less
likely
to
suffer
from
the
severity
of
the
weather
or
the
fatigue
of
a
land
journey
than
most
of
her
companions
when
i
spoke
of
my
intention
to
davilo
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
considered
even
feminine
company
a
protection
any
attempt
upon
you
he
said
must
either
involve
your
companion
for
which
there
can
be
no
legal
excuse
preferred
or
else
expose
the
assailant
to
the
risk
of
being
identified
through
her
evidence
i
started
accordingly
a
few
days
before
the
winter
solstice
of
the
north
reaching
the
great
road
a
few
miles
from
the
point
at
which
it
crosses
another
of
the
great
gulfs
running
due
north
and
south
at
its
narrowest
point
in
latitude
at
this
point
the
inlet
is
no
more
than
twenty
miles
wide
and
its
banks
about
a
hundred
feet
in
height
at
this
level
and
across
this
vast
space
was
carried
a
bridge
supported
by
arches
and
resting
on
pillars
deeply
imbedded
in
the
submarine
rock
at
a
depth
about
equal
to
the
height
of
the
land
on
either
side
the
martial
seas
are
for
the
most
part
shallow
the
landlocked
gulfs
being
seldom
fathoms
and
the
deepest
ocean
soundings
giving
less
than
the
vast
and
solid
structure
looked
as
light
and
airy
as
any
suspension
bridge
across
an
alpine
ravine
this
gigantic
viaduct
about
martial
years
old
is
still
the
most
magnificent
achievement
of
engineering
in
this
department
the
main
roads
connecting
important
cities
or
forming
the
principal
routes
of
commerce
in
the
absence
of
convenient
river
or
sea
carriage
are
carried
over
gulfs
streams
ravines
and
valleys
and
through
hills
as
terrestrial
engineers
have
recently
promised
to
carry
railways
over
the
minor
inequalities
of
ground
that
which
we
were
following
is
an
especially
magnificent
road
and
signalised
by
several
grand
exhibitions
of
engineering
daring
and
genius
it
runs
from
amacasfe
for
a
thousand
miles
in
one
straight
line
direct
as
that
of
a
roman
road
and
with
but
changes
of
level
in
the
whole
distance
it
crossed
in
the
space
of
a
few
miles
a
valley
or
rather
dell
feet
in
depth
and
with
sides
and
a
stream
wider
than
the
mississippi
above
the
junction
of
the
ohio
next
it
traversed
the
precipitous
side
of
a
hill
for
a
distance
of
three
or
four
miles
where
nature
had
not
afforded
foothold
for
a
rabbit
or
a
squirrel
the
stupendous
bridges
and
the
magnificent
open
road
cut
in
the
side
of
the
rock
its
roof
supported
on
the
inside
by
the
hill
itself
on
the
outside
by
pillars
left
at
regular
intervals
when
the
stone
was
cut
formed
from
one
point
a
single
splendid
view
pointing
it
out
to
enva
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
her
capable
under
the
guidance
of
a
few
remarks
from
myself
of
appreciating
and
taking
pride
in
the
marvellous
work
of
her
race
in
another
place
a
tunnel
pierced
directly
an
intervening
range
of
hills
for
about
eight
miles
interrupted
only
in
two
points
by
short
deep
open
cuttings
this
passage
unlike
those
on
the
river
previously
mentioned
was
constantly
and
brilliantly
lighted
the
whole
road
indeed
was
lit
up
from
the
fall
of
the
evening
to
the
dispersion
of
the
morning
mist
with
a
brilliancy
nearly
equal
to
that
of
daylight
as
i
dared
not
travel
at
a
greater
rate
than
miles
per
hour
my
experience
though
it
enabled
me
to
manage
the
carriage
with
sufficient
skill
not
giving
me
confidence
to
push
it
to
its
greatest
speed
the
journey
must
occupy
several
days
we
had
therefore
to
rest
at
the
stations
provided
by
public
authority
for
travellers
undertaking
such
long
land
journeys
these
are
built
like
ordinary
martial
houses
save
that
in
lieu
of
peristyle
or
interior
garden
is
an
open
square
planted
with
shrubs
and
merely
large
enough
to
afford
light
to
the
inner
rooms
the
chambers
also
are
very
much
smaller
than
those
of
good
private
houses
as
these
stations
are
nearly
always
placed
in
towns
or
villages
or
in
country
neighbourhoods
food
is
supplied
by
the
nearest
confectioner
to
each
traveller
individually
and
a
single
person
assisted
by
the
ambau
is
able
to
manage
the
largest
of
them
the
last
two
or
three
days
of
our
journey
were
bitterly
cold
and
not
a
little
trying
my
own
undergarment
of
thick
soft
leather
kept
me
warmer
than
the
warmest
greatcoat
or
cloak
could
have
done
though
i
wore
a
large
cloak
of
the
kargynda
fur
in
addition
the
prize
of
the
hunt
that
had
so
nearly
cost
me
dear
a
personal
and
very
gracious
present
from
the
camptâ
my
companion
who
had
not
the
former
advantage
though
wrapped
in
as
many
outer
garments
and
quilts
as
i
had
thought
necessary
felt
the
cold
severely
and
felt
still
more
the
dense
chill
mist
which
both
by
night
and
day
covered
the
greater
part
of
the
country
this
was
not
infrequently
so
thick
as
to
render
travelling
almost
perilous
and
but
that
an
electric
light
required
by
law
was
placed
at
each
end
of
the
carriage
collisions
would
have
been
inevitable
these
hardships
afforded
another
illustration
of
the
subjection
of
the
sex
resulting
from
the
rule
of
theoretical
equality
more
than
a
year
experience
of
natural
kindness
and
consideration
had
not
given
enva
courage
to
make
a
single
complaint
and
at
first
she
did
her
best
to
conceal
the
weeping
which
was
the
only
but
almost
continuous
expression
of
her
suffering
she
was
almost
as
much
surprised
as
gratified
by
my
expressions
of
sympathy
and
the
trouble
i
took
to
obtain
at
the
first
considerable
town
we
reached
an
apparatus
by
which
the
heat
generated
by
motion
itself
was
made
to
supply
a
certain
warmth
through
the
tubular
of
the
carriage
to
the
persons
of
its
occupants
the
cold
was
as
severe
as
that
of
a
swedish
winter
though
we
never
approached
within
seventeen
degrees
of
the
arctic
circle
a
distance
from
the
pole
equivalent
to
that
of
northern
france
the
martial
thermometer
in
form
more
like
a
which
i
carried
in
my
belt
marked
a
cold
equivalent
to
below
zero
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
when
left
in
the
carriage
for
the
night
it
had
registered
no
less
than
below
zero
one
of
the
professors
of
the
university
received
us
as
his
guests
assigning
to
us
as
is
usual
when
a
lady
is
of
the
party
rooms
looking
on
the
peristyle
but
whose
windows
remained
closed
enva
of
course
spent
her
time
chiefly
with
the
ladies
of
the
family
when
alone
with
me
she
talked
freely
though
needing
some
encouragement
to
express
her
own
ideas
or
report
what
she
had
heard
but
she
had
no
intention
of
concealment
perhaps
no
notion
that
i
was
interested
in
her
accounts
of
the
prevalent
feeling
respecting
the
heretics
of
whom
she
heard
much
except
of
course
that
eveena
father
was
among
them
through
her
i
learned
that
much
pains
had
been
taken
to
intensify
and
excite
into
active
hostility
the
dislike
and
distrust
with
which
they
had
always
been
regarded
by
the
public
at
large
and
especially
by
the
scientific
guilds
whose
members
control
all
educational
establishments
that
some
attempt
against
them
was
meditated
appeared
to
be
generally
reported
its
nature
and
the
movers
in
the
matter
were
not
known
so
far
as
i
could
gather
even
to
men
so
influential
as
the
chief
professors
of
the
university
it
was
not
merely
that
the
women
had
heard
nothing
on
this
point
but
that
their
lords
had
dropped
expressions
of
surprise
at
the
strictness
with
which
the
secret
was
kept
as
their
parents
pay
when
first
the
children
are
admitted
to
the
public
nurseries
the
price
of
an
average
education
this
special
instruction
is
given
in
the
first
instance
at
the
cost
of
the
state
to
those
who
on
account
of
their
taste
and
talent
are
selected
by
the
teachers
of
the
colleges
but
before
they
leave
the
university
a
bond
is
taken
for
the
amount
of
this
outlay
which
has
to
be
repaid
within
three
years
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
tax
is
trivial
in
comparison
with
the
ordinary
gains
of
their
professions
the
more
so
that
no
such
preference
as
in
our
world
is
almost
universally
given
to
a
reputation
which
can
only
be
acquired
by
age
excludes
the
youth
of
mars
from
full
and
profitable
employment
the
youths
were
delighted
to
receive
a
lecture
on
the
forms
of
terrestrial
government
and
the
outlines
of
their
history
a
topic
i
selected
because
they
were
already
acquainted
with
the
substance
of
the
addresses
elsewhere
delivered
this
afforded
me
an
opportunity
of
making
the
personal
acquaintance
of
some
of
the
more
distinguished
pupils
the
clearness
of
their
intellect
the
thoroughness
of
their
knowledge
in
their
several
studies
and
the
distinctness
of
their
acquaintance
with
the
outlines
and
principles
of
martial
learning
generally
an
acquaintance
as
free
from
smattering
and
superficiality
as
necessarily
unembarrassed
by
detail
testified
emphatically
to
the
excellence
of
the
training
they
had
received
as
well
as
to
the
hereditary
development
of
their
brains
what
was
however
not
less
striking
was
the
utter
absence
at
once
of
what
i
was
accustomed
to
regard
as
moral
principle
and
of
the
generous
impulses
which
in
youth
sometimes
supply
the
place
of
principle
they
avowed
the
most
absolute
selfishness
the
most
abject
fear
of
death
and
pain
with
a
frankness
that
would
have
amazed
the
cynics
and
disgusted
the
felons
of
almost
any
earthly
nation
there
were
partial
exceptions
but
these
were
to
be
found
exclusively
among
those
in
training
for
what
we
should
call
public
life
for
administrative
or
judicial
duties
these
though
professing
no
devotion
to
the
interest
of
others
and
little
that
could
be
called
public
spirit
did
nevertheless
understand
that
in
return
for
the
high
rank
the
great
power
and
the
liberal
remuneration
they
would
enjoy
they
were
bound
to
consider
primarily
the
public
interest
in
the
performance
of
their
functions
the
right
of
society
to
just
or
at
least
to
carefully
legal
judgment
and
diligent
efficient
administration
their
feeling
however
was
rather
professional
than
personal
the
pride
of
students
in
the
perfection
of
their
art
rather
than
the
earnestness
of
men
conscious
of
grave
human
responsibilities
in
conversing
with
the
chief
of
this
faculty
i
learned
some
peculiarities
of
the
system
of
government
with
which
i
was
not
yet
acquainted
promotion
never
depends
on
those
with
whom
a
public
servant
comes
into
personal
contact
but
on
those
one
or
two
steps
above
the
latter
the
judges
for
instance
of
the
lower
rank
are
selected
by
the
principal
judge
of
each
dominion
these
and
their
immediate
assistants
by
the
chief
of
the
highest
court
the
officers
around
and
under
the
governor
of
a
province
are
named
by
the
regent
of
the
dominion
those
surrounding
the
regent
as
the
regent
himself
by
the
sovereign
every
officer
however
can
be
removed
by
his
immediate
superior
but
it
depends
on
the
chief
with
whom
his
appointment
rests
whether
he
shall
be
transferred
to
a
similar
post
elsewhere
or
simply
dismissed
thus
while
no
man
can
be
compelled
to
work
with
instruments
he
dislikes
no
subordinate
is
at
the
mercy
of
personal
caprice
or
antipathy
promotion
judicial
and
administrative
ends
below
the
highest
point
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
are
named
by
the
sovereign
with
the
advice
of
a
council
including
the
regents
the
judges
of
that
court
and
the
heads
of
the
philosophic
and
educational
institutes
from
among
the
advocates
and
students
of
law
or
from
among
the
ablest
administrators
who
seem
to
possess
judicial
faculties
the
code
is
written
and
simple
every
dubious
point
that
arises
in
the
course
of
litigation
is
referred
by
appeal
or
directly
by
the
judge
who
decides
it
to
the
chief
court
and
all
points
of
interpretation
thus
referred
are
finally
settled
by
an
addition
to
the
code
at
its
periodical
revision
the
sovereign
can
erase
or
add
at
pleasure
to
this
code
but
he
can
do
so
only
in
full
council
and
must
hear
though
he
need
not
regard
the
opinions
of
his
advisers
he
can
however
suspend
immediately
till
the
next
meeting
of
the
council
the
enforcement
of
any
article
the
regents
are
never
named
from
among
subordinate
officials
nor
is
a
regent
ever
promoted
to
the
throne
it
is
held
that
the
qualities
required
in
an
absolute
sovereign
are
not
such
as
are
demanded
from
or
likely
to
be
developed
in
the
subordinate
ruler
of
a
dominion
however
important
and
that
functions
like
those
of
a
regent
at
least
as
important
as
those
of
the
viceroy
of
india
ought
not
to
be
entrusted
to
men
trained
in
subaltern
administrative
duties
among
the
youths
of
greatest
promise
in
their
eighth
year
a
certain
small
number
are
selected
by
the
chiefs
of
the
university
who
visit
for
this
purpose
all
the
nurseries
of
the
kingdom
with
what
purpose
these
youths
are
separated
from
their
fellows
is
not
explained
to
them
they
are
carefully
educated
for
the
highest
public
duties
year
by
year
those
deemed
fitter
for
less
important
offices
are
drafted
off
there
remain
at
last
the
very
few
who
are
thought
competent
to
the
functions
of
regent
or
camptâ
and
from
among
these
the
sovereign
himself
selects
at
pleasure
his
own
successor
and
the
occupant
of
any
vacant
regency
the
latter
however
holds
his
post
at
first
on
probation
and
can
of
course
be
removed
at
any
time
by
the
sovereign
if
the
latter
should
not
before
his
death
have
named
his
own
successor
the
council
by
a
process
of
elimination
is
reduced
to
three
and
these
cast
lots
which
shall
name
the
new
autocrat
from
among
the
youths
deemed
worthy
of
the
throne
of
whom
six
are
seldom
living
at
the
same
time
no
prince
is
ever
appointed
under
the
age
of
fourteen
or
over
that
of
sixteen
thirty
no
camptâ
has
ever
abdicated
but
they
seldom
live
to
fall
into
that
sort
of
inert
indolence
which
may
be
called
the
dotage
of
their
race
the
nature
of
their
functions
seems
to
preserve
their
mental
activity
longer
than
that
of
others
and
probably
they
are
not
permitted
to
live
when
they
have
become
manifestly
unfit
or
incapable
to
reign
when
first
invited
to
visit
the
university
i
had
hoped
to
make
it
only
a
stage
and
to
something
yet
more
interesting
to
visit
the
arctic
hunters
once
more
and
join
them
in
the
most
exciting
of
their
pursuits
a
chase
by
the
electric
light
of
the
great
amphibia
of
the
frozen
immediately
surrounding
the
permanent
of
the
northern
pole
for
this
however
the
royal
licence
was
required
and
as
when
i
made
a
similar
request
during
the
of
the
southern
season
i
met
with
a
peremptory
refusal
there
are
two
men
in
this
world
said
the
prince
who
would
entertain
such
a
wish
dare
not
avow
it
and
if
there
were
a
third
he
would
assuredly
be
convicted
of
incurable
lunacy
though
on
all
other
points
he
were
as
as
the
president
of
the
academy
or
the
i
did
not
tell
eveena
of
my
request
till
it
had
been
refused
and
if
anything
could
have
lessened
my
vexation
at
the
loss
of
this
third
opportunity
it
would
have
been
the
expression
of
her
countenance
at
that
moment
indeed
i
was
then
satisfied
that
i
could
not
have
left
her
in
the
fever
of
alarm
and
anxiety
that
any
suspicion
of
my
purpose
would
have
caused
i
seized
however
the
opportunity
of
a
winter
voyage
in
a
small
vessel
manned
by
four
or
five
less
timid
and
susceptible
to
surface
disturbances
than
ordinary
seamen
on
such
an
excursion
enva
though
a
far
less
pleasant
companion
was
a
less
anxious
charge
than
eveena
we
made
for
the
northern
coast
and
ran
for
some
hundred
miles
along
a
not
unlike
that
of
norway
but
on
a
miniature
scale
though
in
some
former
age
this
hemisphere
like
europe
has
been
subject
to
glacial
action
much
more
general
and
intense
than
at
present
its
and
must
always
have
been
comparatively
shallow
and
feeble
beaching
at
last
a
break
in
the
long
line
of
capes
and
fiords
where
the
sea
half
covered
with
low
islands
eats
a
broad
and
deep
ingress
into
the
i
disembarked
and
made
a
day
land
journey
to
the
northward
the
ground
was
covered
with
a
sheet
of
snow
about
eighteen
inches
deep
with
an
upper
surface
of
pure
ice
for
the
ordinary
carriage
here
useless
was
substituted
a
sledge
driven
from
behind
by
an
instrument
something
between
a
and
a
screw
worked
of
course
by
the
usual
electric
machinery
the
cold
was
far
more
intense
than
i
had
ever
before
known
it
and
the
mist
that
fell
at
the
close
of
the
very
short
zyda
of
daylight
rendered
it
all
but
intolerable
the
arctic
circular
thermometer
fell
to
within
a
few
points
from
its
minimum
of
centigrade
no
flesh
could
endure
exposure
to
such
an
atmosphere
and
were
not
the
inner
mask
and
clothing
of
soft
leather
pervaded
by
a
constant
feeble
current
of
electricity
as
we
made
our
way
back
to
the
open
sea
the
temptation
to
disobey
the
royal
order
was
all
but
irresistible
no
fewer
than
three
kargyndau
were
within
shot
at
one
and
the
same
time
plunging
from
the
shore
of
an
icy
island
to
emerge
with
their
prey
a
fish
somewhat
resembling
the
salmon
in
form
and
flavour
my
companions
however
were
terrified
at
the
thought
of
disobedience
to
the
law
and
as
we
had
but
one
mordyta
among
the
party
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
had
been
before
proven
to
my
cost
there
was
some
force
in
their
supplementary
argument
that
if
i
did
not
kill
the
kargynda
it
was
probable
that
the
kargynda
might
board
us
in
which
event
our
case
would
be
summarily
disposed
of
without
troubling
the
courts
or
allowing
time
to
apply
even
by
telegraph
for
the
royal
pardon
i
was
suggesting
more
to
the
alarm
than
amusement
of
the
crew
that
we
might
close
the
hatches
and
either
carry
the
regal
beast
away
captive
or
at
worst
dive
and
drown
him
for
he
can
not
swim
very
far
when
their
objections
were
enforced
in
an
unexpected
manner
we
were
drifting
beyond
shot
of
the
nearest
brute
when
the
three
suddenly
plunged
at
once
and
as
if
by
concert
and
when
they
rose
were
all
evidently
making
for
the
vessel
and
within
some
eighty
yards
i
then
learnt
a
new
advantage
of
the
electric
machinery
as
compared
with
the
most
powerful
a
pressure
upon
a
button
and
a
few
seconds
sufficed
to
exchange
a
speed
of
four
for
one
of
twenty
miles
an
hour
while
instead
of
sinking
the
vessel
below
the
surface
the
master
directed
the
engine
to
pump
out
all
the
liquid
ballast
she
contained
the
waterspout
thus
sent
forth
the
enemy
which
had
already
come
within
a
few
yards
of
our
starboard
quarter
and
the
others
it
was
just
as
well
that
enva
who
heartily
hated
the
bitter
cold
was
snugly
ensconced
in
the
warm
cushions
of
the
cabin
and
had
not
therefore
the
opportunity
of
giving
to
eveena
on
our
return
her
version
of
an
adventure
whose
alarming
aspect
would
have
impressed
them
both
more
than
its
ludicrous
side
for
half
a
minute
i
thought
that
i
had
in
sheer
folly
exposed
half
a
dozen
lives
to
a
peril
none
the
less
real
and
none
the
more
satisfactory
that
if
five
had
been
killed
the
survivor
could
not
have
so
told
the
story
as
to
avoid
laughing
or
being
laughed
at
sweet
and
serene
as
was
eveena
smile
of
welcome
it
could
not
conceal
the
traces
of
more
than
mere
depression
on
her
countenance
heartily
willing
to
administer
an
effective
lesson
to
her
tormentors
i
seized
the
occasion
of
the
sunset
meal
to
notice
the
weary
and
harassed
look
she
had
failed
wholly
to
banish
you
look
worse
each
time
i
return
madonna
this
time
it
is
not
merely
my
absence
if
it
ever
were
so
i
will
know
who
or
what
has
driven
and
hunted
you
so
taken
thus
by
surprise
every
face
but
one
bore
witness
to
the
truth
eveena
distress
eunané
mixed
relief
and
dismay
shared
in
yet
greater
degree
by
velna
who
knew
less
of
me
the
sheer
terror
and
confusion
of
the
rest
were
equally
significant
the
martial
judge
who
said
that
the
best
evidence
was
lost
because
colour
could
not
be
tested
or
blushes
analysed
would
have
passed
sentence
at
once
but
if
eivé
air
of
innocent
unconsciousness
and
childish
indifference
were
not
sincere
it
merited
the
proverbial
praise
of
consummate
affectation
more
golden
than
the
sun
and
whiter
than
snow
momentary
glance
at
once
drew
mine
upon
this
pet
child
but
neither
disturbed
her
nor
did
she
overact
her
part
eivé
said
enva
one
day
never
salts
her
tears
or
paints
her
blushes
as
soon
as
she
caught
my
look
of
doubt
have
done
wrong
she
said
in
a
tone
half
of
confidence
half
of
reproach
punish
me
then
clasfempta
as
you
please
with
sandal
the
repartee
delighted
those
who
had
reason
to
desire
any
diversion
the
appeal
to
eveena
disarmed
my
unwilling
and
momentary
distrust
eveena
however
answered
by
neither
word
nor
look
and
the
party
presently
broke
up
eivé
crept
close
to
claim
some
silent
atonement
for
unspoken
suspicion
and
a
few
minutes
had
elapsed
before
to
the
evident
alarm
of
several
conscious
culprits
i
sought
eveena
in
her
own
chamber
in
spite
of
all
deprecation
i
insisted
on
the
explanation
she
had
evaded
in
public
i
guess
i
said
as
much
as
you
can
tell
me
about
four
i
have
borne
too
long
with
those
who
have
made
your
life
that
of
a
hunted
therne
and
rendered
myself
anxious
and
restless
every
day
and
hour
that
i
have
left
you
alone
unless
you
will
deny
that
they
have
done
so
well
then
i
will
have
peace
for
you
and
for
myself
i
can
not
leave
you
to
their
mercy
nor
can
i
remain
at
home
for
the
next
twelve
dozen
days
like
a
chained
pass
them
over
as
she
strove
to
remonstrate
there
is
something
new
this
time
you
have
been
harassed
and
frightened
as
well
as
unhappy
yes
she
admitted
but
i
can
give
nothing
like
a
reason
i
dare
not
entreat
you
not
to
ask
and
yet
i
am
only
like
a
child
that
wakes
screaming
by
night
and
can
not
say
of
what
she
is
afraid
ought
she
not
to
be
whipped
i
ca
say
bambina
but
i
should
not
advise
eivé
to
startle
in
that
way
but
seriously
i
suppose
fear
is
most
painful
when
it
has
no
cause
that
can
be
removed
i
have
seen
brave
soldiers
in
the
dark
without
well
knowing
why
i
watched
her
face
as
i
spoke
and
noted
that
while
the
pet
name
i
had
used
in
the
first
days
of
our
marriage
now
recalled
by
her
image
elicited
a
faint
smile
the
mention
of
eivé
clouded
it
again
she
was
so
unwilling
to
speak
that
i
caught
at
the
clue
afforded
by
her
silence
it
eivé
then
the
little
hypocrite
she
shall
find
your
sandal
heavier
than
mine
no
no
she
pleaded
eagerly
you
have
seen
what
eivé
is
in
your
presence
and
to
me
she
is
always
the
same
if
she
were
not
could
i
complain
of
her
and
why
not
eveena
do
you
think
i
should
hesitate
between
you
no
she
answered
with
unusual
decision
of
tone
i
will
tell
you
exactly
what
you
would
do
you
would
take
my
word
implicitly
you
would
have
made
up
your
mind
before
you
heard
her
you
would
deal
harder
measure
to
eivé
than
to
any
one
she
is
your
pet
you
would
think
for
once
not
of
sparing
the
culprit
but
of
satisfying
me
and
afterwards
she
paused
and
i
saw
that
she
would
not
conclude
in
words
a
sentence
i
could
perhaps
have
finished
for
myself
i
see
i
replied
that
eivé
is
the
source
of
your
trouble
but
not
what
the
trouble
is
for
her
sake
do
not
force
me
to
extort
the
truth
from
her
i
doubt
whether
she
has
guessed
my
misgiving
eveena
answered
it
may
be
that
you
are
right
that
it
is
because
she
was
so
long
the
only
one
you
were
fond
of
that
i
can
not
like
and
trust
her
as
you
do
but
you
leave
the
telegraph
in
my
charge
understanding
of
course
that
it
will
be
used
as
when
you
are
at
home
so
after
warning
i
have
written
their
messages
for
eunané
and
the
others
but
i
could
not
refuse
eivé
request
to
write
her
own
and
like
you
i
have
never
read
them
why
i
asked
surely
it
is
strange
to
give
her
of
all
a
special
privilege
and
confidence
eveena
was
silent
she
could
in
no
case
have
reproached
me
in
words
and
even
the
reproach
of
silence
was
so
unusual
that
i
could
not
but
feel
it
keenly
i
saw
at
that
moment
that
for
whatever
had
happened
or
might
happen
i
might
thank
myself
might
thank
the
doubt
i
would
not
avow
to
my
own
mind
but
could
not
conceal
from
her
that
eveena
had
condescended
to
something
like
jealousy
of
one
whose
childish
simplicity
real
or
affected
had
strangely
won
my
heart
as
children
do
win
hearts
hardened
by
experience
of
life
roughness
and
evil
i
know
nothing
eveena
said
at
last
yet
somehow
and
wholly
without
any
reason
i
can
explain
i
fear
eivé
you
may
remember
has
as
your
companion
made
acquaintance
with
many
households
whose
heads
you
do
not
believe
friends
to
you
or
the
zinta
she
is
a
diligent
correspondent
she
never
affects
to
conceal
anything
and
yet
no
one
of
us
has
lately
seen
the
contents
of
a
note
sent
or
received
by
her
there
was
nothing
tangible
in
eveena
suspicion
it
was
most
repugnant
to
my
own
feelings
and
yet
it
implanted
whether
by
force
of
sympathy
or
of
instinct
a
misgiving
that
never
left
me
again
my
own
i
answered
i
would
trust
your
judgment
your
observation
or
feminine
instinct
and
insight
into
character
far
sooner
than
my
own
conclusions
upon
solid
facts
but
instincts
and
presentiments
though
we
are
not
scientifically
ignorant
enough
to
disregard
them
are
not
evidence
on
which
we
can
act
or
even
inquire
no
she
said
and
yet
it
is
hard
to
feel
as
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
the
is
forming
that
the
bolt
is
almost
ready
to
strike
and
that
you
are
risking
life
and
perhaps
more
than
life
out
of
a
delicacy
no
other
man
would
show
towards
a
child
since
child
you
will
have
her
who
i
feel
sure
deserves
all
she
might
receive
from
the
hands
of
one
who
would
have
the
truth
at
any
cost
you
feel
i
answered
for
me
as
i
should
feel
for
you
but
is
death
so
terrible
to
it
means
leaving
you
i
wish
we
knew
that
it
does
not
mean
losing
for
ever
after
so
brief
an
enjoyment
all
that
is
perishable
in
love
like
ours
or
it
would
not
be
worth
fearing
i
do
think
i
ever
did
fear
it
till
you
made
my
life
so
sweet
but
life
is
not
worth
an
unkindness
or
injustice
better
die
trusting
to
the
last
than
live
in
the
misery
and
shame
of
suspecting
one
i
love
or
dreading
treacherous
malice
from
any
hand
under
my
own
roof
when
i
met
davilo
the
next
morning
the
grave
and
anxious
expression
of
his
face
usually
calm
and
serene
even
in
deepest
thought
as
are
those
of
the
experienced
members
of
an
order
confident
in
the
consciousness
of
irresistible
secret
power
not
a
little
disturbed
me
as
eveena
had
said
the
was
forming
and
a
chill
went
to
my
heart
which
in
facing
measurable
and
open
peril
it
had
never
felt
i
bring
you
he
said
a
message
that
will
not
i
am
afraid
be
welcome
he
whose
guest
you
were
at
serocasfe
invites
you
to
pay
him
an
immediate
visit
and
the
invitation
must
be
accepted
at
once
i
drew
myself
up
with
no
little
indignation
at
the
imperative
tone
but
feeling
at
least
equal
awe
at
the
stern
calmness
with
which
the
mandate
was
spoken
and
what
compels
me
to
such
haste
or
to
compliance
without
consideration
that
power
he
returned
which
none
can
resist
and
to
which
you
may
not
demur
seeing
that
i
still
hesitated
in
truth
the
summons
had
turned
my
vague
misgiving
into
intense
though
equally
vague
alarm
and
even
terror
which
as
unmanly
and
unworthy
i
strove
to
repress
but
which
asserted
its
domination
in
a
manner
as
unwonted
as
unwelcome
he
drew
aside
a
fold
of
his
robe
and
showed
within
the
silver
star
of
the
order
supported
by
the
golden
sash
that
marked
a
rank
second
only
to
that
of
the
wearer
of
the
signet
itself
i
understood
too
well
by
this
time
through
conversations
with
him
and
other
communications
of
which
it
has
been
needless
to
speak
the
significance
of
this
revelation
i
knew
the
impossibility
of
questioning
the
authority
to
which
i
had
pledged
obedience
i
realised
with
great
amazement
the
fact
that
a
secondary
position
on
my
own
estate
and
a
personal
charge
of
my
own
safety
had
been
accepted
by
a
chief
of
the
zinta
there
is
of
course
i
replied
at
last
no
answer
to
a
mandate
so
enforced
but
chief
reluctant
as
i
am
to
say
it
i
fear
fear
as
i
have
never
done
before
and
yet
fear
i
can
not
say
i
can
not
guess
what
there
is
no
cause
for
alarm
he
said
somewhat
contemptuously
in
this
journey
sudden
speedy
and
made
under
our
guard
as
on
our
summons
there
is
little
or
none
of
that
peril
which
has
beset
you
so
long
you
forget
chief
i
rejoined
that
you
speak
to
a
soldier
whose
chosen
trade
was
to
risk
life
at
the
word
of
a
superior
to
one
whose
youth
thought
no
smile
so
bright
as
that
of
naked
steel
and
had
often
the
lips
of
the
lightning
ere
the
down
darkened
his
own
at
any
rate
you
have
told
me
daily
for
more
than
a
year
that
i
am
living
under
constant
peril
of
assassination
have
i
seemed
to
quail
thereat
if
then
i
am
now
terrified
for
the
first
time
that
which
i
dread
without
knowing
or
dreaming
what
it
is
is
assuredly
a
peril
worse
than
any
i
have
known
the
shadow
of
a
calamity
against
which
i
have
neither
weapon
nor
courage
it
can
not
be
for
myself
that
i
am
thus
appalled
i
continued
the
thought
flashing
into
my
mind
as
i
spoke
it
and
there
is
but
one
whose
life
is
so
closely
bound
with
mine
that
danger
to
her
should
bring
such
terror
as
this
i
go
at
your
bidding
but
i
will
not
go
alone
he
paused
for
some
time
apparently
in
perplexity
certainly
in
deep
thought
before
he
replied
as
you
will
one
thing
more
the
slips
of
tafroo
with
which
you
furnished
me
have
been
under
the
eyes
of
which
you
have
heard
this
handing
me
the
one
that
bore
no
mark
has
passed
so
far
as
the
highest
powers
of
the
sense
that
is
not
of
the
body
can
perceive
through
none
but
innocent
hands
the
hand
from
which
you
received
this
the
marked
slip
is
spotted
with
treason
and
may
be
red
i
was
less
impressed
by
this
declaration
than
probably
would
have
been
any
other
member
of
the
order
i
had
seen
on
earth
the
most
marvellous
perceptions
of
a
perfectly
lucid
vision
succeeded
sometimes
within
the
space
of
the
same
day
by
dreams
or
hallucinations
the
most
absolutely
deceptive
i
felt
therefore
more
satisfaction
in
the
acquittal
of
eunané
whom
i
had
never
doubted
than
trouble
at
the
grave
suspicion
suggested
against
eivé
a
suspicion
i
still
refused
to
entertain
you
should
enter
your
balloon
as
soon
as
the
sunset
mist
will
conceal
it
said
davilo
by
you
may
reach
the
deep
bay
on
the
mid
of
the
north
where
a
swift
vessel
will
meet
you
and
convey
you
in
two
or
three
days
by
a
direct
course
through
the
canal
and
gulf
you
have
traversed
already
to
the
port
from
which
you
commenced
your
first
submarine
voyage
you
had
better
i
said
make
your
instruction
a
little
more
particular
or
i
shall
hardly
know
how
to
direct
my
course
do
not
dream
he
answered
that
you
will
be
permitted
to
undertake
such
a
journey
but
under
the
safest
guidance
at
the
time
i
have
named
all
will
be
ready
for
your
departure
and
you
have
simply
to
sleep
or
read
or
meditate
as
you
will
till
you
reach
your
destination
eveena
was
not
a
little
startled
when
i
informed
her
of
the
sudden
journey
before
me
and
my
determination
that
she
should
be
my
companion
it
was
unquestionably
a
trying
effort
for
her
especially
the
balloon
voyage
which
would
expose
her
to
the
cold
of
the
mists
and
of
the
night
and
i
feared
to
the
intenser
cold
of
the
upper
air
but
i
dared
not
leave
her
and
she
was
pleased
by
a
peremptory
decision
which
made
her
the
companion
of
my
absence
without
leaving
room
for
discussion
or
question
the
time
for
our
departure
was
drawing
near
when
followed
by
eunané
she
came
into
my
chamber
if
we
are
to
be
long
away
she
said
you
must
say
on
whom
my
charges
are
to
devolve
as
you
please
i
answered
sure
of
her
choice
and
well
content
to
see
her
hand
over
her
cares
to
eunané
who
if
she
lacked
the
wisdom
and
forbearance
of
eveena
could
certainly
hold
the
reins
with
a
stronger
hand
eivé
she
said
has
asked
the
charge
of
my
flowerbed
but
i
had
promised
it
and
and
you
would
rather
give
it
i
answered
to
eunané
naturally
and
i
should
not
care
to
allow
eivé
the
chance
of
spoiling
your
work
i
think
we
may
now
trust
whatever
is
yours
in
those
once
troublesome
hands
looking
at
eunané
with
perfect
assurance
that
they
will
do
their
best
i
had
never
before
parted
even
from
eunané
with
any
feeling
of
regret
but
on
this
occasion
an
impulse
i
could
not
account
for
but
have
ever
since
been
glad
to
remember
made
me
turn
at
the
last
moment
and
add
to
eveena
earnest
embrace
a
few
words
of
affection
and
confidence
which
evidently
cheered
and
encouraged
her
deputy
the
car
that
awaited
us
was
of
the
light
tubular
construction
common
here
formed
of
the
silvery
metal
about
eighteen
feet
in
length
and
half
that
breadth
it
was
divided
into
two
compartments
each
with
the
aid
of
canopy
and
curtains
forming
at
will
a
closed
tent
and
securing
almost
as
much
privacy
as
an
arab
family
enjoys
or
opening
to
the
sky
in
that
with
which
the
sails
and
machinery
were
connected
were
davilo
and
two
of
his
attendants
the
other
had
been
carefully
lined
and
covered
with
furs
and
wrappings
indicating
an
attention
to
my
companion
which
indeed
is
rarely
shown
to
women
by
their
own
lords
and
which
none
but
the
daughter
of
esmo
would
have
received
even
among
the
brethren
of
the
order
ere
we
departed
i
had
arranged
her
cushions
and
wrapped
her
closely
in
the
warmest
coverings
and
flinging
over
her
at
last
the
kargynda
skin
received
from
the
camptâ
i
bade
her
sleep
if
possible
during
our
aerial
voyage
there
was
need
to
provide
as
carefully
as
possible
for
her
comfort
the
balloon
shot
up
at
once
above
the
evening
mists
to
a
height
at
which
the
cold
was
intense
but
at
which
our
voyage
could
be
guided
by
the
stars
invisible
from
below
and
at
which
we
escaped
the
more
dangerously
chilling
damp
the
wind
that
blew
right
in
our
teeth
caused
by
no
atmospheric
current
but
by
our
own
rapid
passage
would
in
a
few
moments
have
frozen
my
face
perhaps
fatally
had
not
thick
skins
been
arranged
to
screen
us
even
through
these
it
blew
with
intense
severity
and
i
was
glad
indeed
to
cover
myself
from
head
to
foot
and
lie
down
beside
eveena
her
hand
as
she
laid
it
on
mine
was
painfully
cold
but
the
shivering
i
could
hardly
suppress
made
her
anxious
to
part
in
my
favour
with
some
at
least
of
the
many
coverings
that
could
hardly
screen
herself
from
the
searching
blast
not
at
the
greatest
height
i
reached
among
the
himalayas
nor
on
the
steppes
of
tartary
had
i
experienced
a
cold
severer
than
this
the
sun
had
just
turned
westward
when
we
reached
the
port
at
which
we
were
to
embark
despite
the
cold
eveena
had
slept
during
the
latter
part
of
our
voyage
and
was
still
sleeping
when
i
placed
her
on
the
cushions
in
our
cabin
the
sudden
and
most
welcome
change
from
bitter
cold
to
comfortable
warmth
awakened
her
as
it
at
last
allowed
me
to
sleep
our
journey
was
continued
below
the
surface
at
a
rate
of
more
than
twelve
hundred
miles
in
the
day
a
speed
which
made
observation
through
the
thick
but
perfectly
transparent
side
windows
of
our
cabin
impossible
i
was
indisposed
for
meditation
which
could
have
been
directed
to
no
other
subject
than
the
mysterious
purpose
of
our
journey
and
had
not
provided
myself
with
books
but
in
eveena
company
it
was
impossible
that
the
time
should
pass
slowly
or
wearily
in
this
balloon
journey
i
had
a
specially
advantageous
opportunity
of
observing
the
two
moons
velnaa
as
they
are
called
or
caulna
the
nearer
in
diameter
about
or
a
little
more
than
that
of
our
moon
is
a
tolerably
brilliant
object
about
miles
from
the
surface
moving
like
all
planets
and
satellites
from
west
to
east
it
completes
its
stellar
revolution
and
its
phases
in
less
than
seven
and
a
half
hours
the
contrary
revolution
of
the
skies
prolongs
its
circuit
around
the
planet
to
a
period
of
ten
hours
zeelna
returns
to
the
same
celestial
meridian
in
thirty
hours
but
as
in
this
time
the
starry
vault
has
completed
about
a
rotation
and
a
quarter
in
the
opposite
direction
it
takes
nearly
five
days
to
reappear
on
the
same
horizon
it
is
about
in
diameter
and
about
miles
from
the
surface
the
result
of
the
combined
motions
is
that
the
two
moons
to
the
eye
seem
to
move
in
opposite
directions
when
we
rose
above
the
mists
caulna
was
visible
as
a
very
fine
crescent
in
the
west
zeelna
was
rising
in
the
east
and
almost
full
but
hardly
a
more
brilliant
object
than
venus
when
seen
to
most
advantage
from
earth
both
moved
so
rapidly
among
the
stars
that
their
celestial
change
of
place
was
apparent
from
minute
to
minute
but
as
regarded
our
own
position
the
appearance
was
as
opposite
as
their
direction
zeelna
traversing
in
twelve
hours
only
of
the
visible
hemisphere
while
crossing
in
the
same
time
on
the
zodiac
twelve
degrees
per
hour
or
our
moon
diameter
in
two
minutes
and
a
half
was
left
behind
by
the
stars
and
fixing
what
i
may
call
the
ocular
attention
on
her
she
seemed
to
stand
still
while
they
slowly
passed
her
thus
making
their
revolution
perceptible
to
sense
as
it
never
is
on
earth
for
lack
of
a
similar
standard
caulna
rising
in
the
west
and
moving
eastwards
crossed
the
visible
sky
in
five
hours
and
passed
through
the
stars
at
the
rate
of
per
hour
so
that
she
seemed
to
sail
past
them
like
a
golden
cloudlet
or
celestial
vessel
driven
by
a
slow
wind
it
happened
this
night
that
she
passed
over
the
star
fomalhaut
an
occultation
which
i
watched
with
great
interest
through
an
excellent
but
which
lasted
only
for
about
half
a
minute
about
an
hour
before
midnight
the
two
moons
passed
each
other
in
the
eastern
sky
both
gibbous
at
the
moment
like
our
moon
in
her
last
quarter
the
difference
in
size
and
motion
was
then
most
striking
caulna
seeming
to
rush
past
her
companion
and
the
latter
looking
like
a
stationary
star
in
the
slowly
moving
sky
chapter
xxv
apostacy
we
were
received
on
landing
by
our
former
host
and
conducted
to
his
house
on
this
occasion
however
i
was
not
detained
in
the
hall
but
permitted
at
once
to
enter
the
chamber
allotted
to
us
eveena
who
had
exacted
from
me
all
that
i
knew
and
much
that
i
meant
to
conceal
respecting
the
occasion
of
our
journey
was
much
agitated
and
not
a
little
alarmed
my
own
humble
rank
in
the
zinta
rendered
so
sudden
and
imperative
a
summons
the
more
difficult
to
understand
and
though
by
this
time
well
versed
in
the
learning
neither
of
us
was
familiar
with
the
administration
of
the
brotherhood
i
was
glad
therefore
on
her
account
even
more
than
on
my
own
when
a
scratch
at
the
door
having
obtained
admission
for
an
ambâ
it
placed
before
me
a
message
from
esmo
requesting
a
private
conference
her
father
presence
set
eveena
mind
at
rest
since
she
had
learned
strangely
enough
from
myself
what
she
had
never
known
before
the
rank
he
held
among
the
brethren
i
have
summoned
you
he
said
as
soon
as
i
joined
him
for
more
than
one
reason
there
is
but
one
however
that
i
need
now
explain
important
questions
are
as
a
rule
either
settled
by
the
chiefs
alone
in
council
or
submitted
to
a
general
meeting
of
the
order
in
this
case
neither
course
can
be
adopted
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
myself
that
under
present
circumstances
you
could
render
material
service
in
either
of
the
two
directions
in
which
it
may
be
required
but
those
by
whom
the
cause
has
been
prepared
have
asked
that
you
should
be
one
of
the
convent
and
such
a
request
is
never
refused
indeed
its
refusal
would
imply
either
such
injustice
as
would
render
the
whole
proceeding
utterly
incompatible
with
the
first
principles
of
our
cohesion
or
such
distrust
of
the
person
summoned
as
is
never
felt
for
a
member
of
the
brotherhood
i
would
rather
say
no
more
on
the
subject
now
your
nerve
and
judgment
will
be
sufficiently
tried
and
it
is
a
valuable
maxim
of
our
science
that
in
the
hours
immediately
preceding
either
an
important
decision
or
a
severe
trial
the
spirit
should
be
left
as
far
as
possible
calm
and
unvexed
by
vague
shadows
of
that
which
is
to
come
the
maxim
thus
expressed
if
rendered
into
the
language
of
material
medicine
is
among
those
which
every
man
of
experience
holds
and
practically
acts
upon
i
turned
the
conversation
then
by
inviting
esmo
into
my
own
apartment
and
i
was
touched
indeed
by
the
eager
delight
even
stronger
than
i
had
expected
with
which
eveena
welcomed
her
father
and
inquired
into
the
minutest
details
of
the
home
life
from
which
she
had
been
as
it
seemed
to
her
so
long
separated
what
was
however
specially
characteristic
was
the
delicate
care
with
which
even
in
this
first
meeting
with
one
of
her
own
family
she
contrived
still
to
give
the
paramount
place
in
her
attention
to
her
husband
and
never
for
a
moment
to
let
him
feel
excluded
from
a
conversation
with
whose
topics
he
was
imperfectly
acquainted
and
in
which
he
might
have
been
supposed
uninterested
the
hours
thus
passed
pleasantly
away
and
except
when
kevimâ
joined
us
at
the
evening
meal
adding
a
new
and
unexpected
pleasure
to
eveena
natural
delight
in
this
sudden
reunion
we
remained
undisturbed
until
a
very
low
electric
signal
sounding
apparently
through
several
chambers
at
once
recalled
esmo
mind
to
the
duties
before
him
you
will
not
he
said
return
till
late
and
i
wish
you
would
induce
eveena
to
ensure
by
composing
herself
to
sleep
before
your
return
that
you
shall
not
be
asked
to
converse
until
the
morning
he
withdrew
with
kevimâ
and
as
instructed
i
proceeded
to
change
my
dress
for
one
of
pure
white
adapted
to
the
occasion
with
only
a
band
of
crimson
around
the
waist
and
throat
and
to
invest
myself
in
the
badge
of
the
order
the
turban
which
i
wore
without
attracting
attention
in
the
asiatic
rather
than
in
the
martial
form
was
of
white
mingled
with
red
a
novelty
which
seemed
to
eveena
eyes
painfully
ominous
in
martial
language
as
in
zveltic
symbolism
crimson
generally
takes
the
place
of
black
as
the
emblem
of
guilt
and
peril
when
esmo
our
chamber
for
a
moment
to
summon
me
he
was
invested
as
in
the
shrine
itself
in
the
full
attire
of
his
office
and
i
was
recalled
to
a
recollection
of
the
reverence
due
to
the
head
of
the
brotherhood
by
the
sudden
change
in
eveena
manner
to
her
father
though
a
most
respectful
she
was
a
fearlessly
affectionate
child
for
clavelta
she
had
only
the
reverence
deeply
intermingled
with
awe
with
which
a
devout
catholic
convert
from
the
east
may
approach
for
the
first
time
some
more
than
usually
imposing
occupant
of
the
chair
of
peter
before
the
arm
that
bore
the
signet
and
the
sash
of
gold
we
bent
knee
and
head
in
the
deference
prescribed
by
our
rules
a
homage
which
the
youngest
child
in
the
public
nurseries
would
not
dream
of
offering
to
the
camptâ
himself
at
a
sign
from
his
hand
i
followed
esmo
hoping
rather
than
expecting
that
eveena
would
obey
the
counsel
indirectly
addressed
to
her
traversing
the
same
passages
as
before
save
that
a
slight
turn
avoided
the
symbolic
bridge
and
formally
challenged
at
each
point
as
usual
by
the
sentries
who
saluted
with
profoundest
reverence
the
signet
of
the
order
we
passed
at
last
into
the
hall
of
initiation
but
on
this
occasion
its
aspect
was
completely
changed
a
space
immediately
in
front
of
what
i
may
call
the
veil
of
the
shrine
was
closed
in
by
drapery
of
white
bordered
with
crimson
the
chiefs
occupied
as
before
their
seats
on
the
platform
some
fifty
members
of
the
order
sat
to
right
and
left
immediately
below
but
esmo
on
this
occasion
seated
himself
on
the
second
leftward
step
of
the
throne
which
with
the
silver
light
and
the
other
mystic
emblems
was
unveiled
in
the
same
strange
manner
as
before
at
his
approach
near
the
lower
end
of
the
small
chamber
thus
formed
crossing
the
passage
between
the
seats
on
either
hand
was
a
barrier
of
the
bright
red
metal
i
have
more
than
once
mentioned
and
behind
it
a
seat
of
some
sable
material
behind
this
to
right
and
left
stood
silent
and
erect
two
sentries
robed
in
green
and
armed
with
the
usual
spear
a
deep
intense
absolute
silence
prevailed
from
the
moment
when
the
last
of
the
party
had
taken
his
place
for
the
space
of
some
ten
minutes
in
the
faces
of
the
chiefs
and
of
some
of
the
elder
initiates
who
were
probably
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
scene
to
follow
was
an
expression
of
calm
but
deep
pain
and
regret
crossed
now
and
then
by
a
shade
of
anxiety
such
as
rarely
appeared
in
that
abode
of
assured
peace
and
profound
security
on
no
countenance
was
visible
the
slightest
shadow
of
restlessness
or
curiosity
in
the
changed
aspect
of
the
place
the
changed
tone
of
its
associations
and
of
the
feelings
habitual
to
its
frequenters
there
was
something
which
impressed
and
overawed
the
petulance
of
youth
and
even
the
indifference
of
an
experience
like
my
own
at
last
stretching
forth
the
staff
of
mingled
white
and
red
which
on
this
occasion
each
of
the
chiefs
had
substituted
for
their
usual
crystal
wand
esmo
spoke
not
raising
his
voice
a
single
semitone
above
its
usual
pitch
but
with
even
unwonted
gravity
come
forward
asco
zvelta
he
said
the
sight
i
now
witnessed
no
description
could
represent
to
one
who
had
not
seen
the
same
parting
the
drapery
at
the
lower
end
there
came
forward
a
figure
in
which
the
most
absolutely
inexperienced
eye
could
not
fail
to
recognise
a
culprit
called
to
trial
came
forward
i
have
said
because
i
can
use
no
other
words
but
such
was
not
the
term
which
would
have
occurred
to
any
one
who
witnessed
the
movement
was
dragged
forward
i
should
say
did
i
attempt
to
convey
the
impression
produced
save
that
no
compulsion
no
physical
force
was
used
nor
were
there
any
to
use
it
and
yet
the
miserable
man
approached
slowly
reluctantly
shrinking
back
as
one
who
strives
with
superior
corporeal
power
exerted
to
force
him
onward
as
if
physically
dragged
on
step
by
step
by
invisible
bonds
held
by
hands
unseen
so
with
white
face
and
shaking
form
he
reached
the
barrier
and
knelt
as
esmo
rose
from
his
place
honouring
instinctively
though
his
eyes
seemed
incapable
of
discerning
them
the
symbols
of
supreme
authority
then
at
a
silent
gesture
he
rose
and
fell
back
into
the
chair
placed
for
him
apparently
unable
to
stand
and
scarcely
able
to
sustain
himself
on
his
seat
brother
said
the
junior
of
the
chiefs
or
he
who
occupied
the
place
farthest
to
the
right
and
now
i
noticed
that
eleven
were
present
the
last
seat
on
the
right
of
him
who
spoke
being
vacant
you
have
unveiled
to
strangers
the
secrets
of
the
shrine
he
paused
for
an
answer
and
in
a
tone
strangely
unnatural
and
expressionless
came
from
the
scarcely
parted
lips
of
the
culprit
the
reply
it
is
true
you
have
said
the
next
of
the
chiefs
accepted
reward
to
place
the
lives
of
your
brethren
at
the
mercy
of
their
enemies
it
is
true
you
have
said
he
who
occupied
the
lowest
seat
upon
the
left
forsworn
in
heart
and
deed
if
not
in
word
the
vows
by
which
you
willingly
bound
yourself
and
the
law
whose
boons
you
had
accepted
again
the
same
confession
forced
evidently
by
some
overwhelming
power
from
one
who
would
if
he
could
have
denied
or
remained
silent
and
to
whom
said
esmo
interposing
for
the
first
time
have
you
thus
betrayed
us
i
know
not
was
the
reply
explain
said
the
chief
immediately
to
the
left
of
the
throne
who
if
there
were
a
difference
in
the
expression
of
the
calm
sad
faces
seemed
to
entertain
more
of
compassion
and
less
of
disgust
and
repulsion
towards
the
offender
than
any
other
those
with
whom
i
spoke
replied
the
culprit
in
the
same
strange
tone
were
not
known
to
me
but
gave
token
of
authority
next
to
that
of
the
camptâ
they
told
me
that
the
existence
of
the
order
had
long
been
known
that
many
of
its
members
were
clearly
indicated
by
their
household
practices
that
their
destruction
was
determined
that
i
was
known
as
a
member
of
the
order
and
might
choose
between
perishing
first
of
their
victims
and
receiving
reward
such
as
i
should
name
myself
for
the
information
i
could
give
what
have
you
told
asked
another
of
the
chiefs
i
have
not
named
one
of
the
symbols
i
have
not
betrayed
the
shrine
or
the
passwords
i
have
told
that
the
zinta
i
have
told
the
meaning
of
the
serpent
the
circle
and
the
star
though
i
have
not
named
them
and
said
he
on
the
left
of
the
throne
naming
the
hope
that
is
more
than
all
hope
recalling
the
power
that
is
above
all
power
could
you
dare
to
renounce
the
one
and
draw
on
your
own
head
the
justice
of
the
other
what
reward
could
induce
a
child
of
the
light
to
turn
back
into
darkness
what
authority
could
protect
the
traitor
from
the
fate
he
imprecated
and
accepted
when
he
first
knelt
before
the
throne
the
hope
was
distant
and
the
light
was
dim
the
offender
answered
i
was
threatened
and
i
was
tempted
i
knew
that
death
speedy
and
painless
was
the
penalty
of
treason
to
the
order
that
a
death
of
prolonged
torture
might
be
the
vengeance
of
the
power
that
menaced
me
i
hoped
little
in
the
far
and
dim
future
of
the
serpent
promise
and
i
hoped
and
feared
much
in
the
life
on
this
side
of
death
do
you
know
asked
the
last
inquirer
again
no
name
and
nothing
that
can
enable
us
to
trace
those
with
whom
you
spoke
or
those
who
employed
them
only
this
was
the
answer
that
one
of
them
has
an
especial
hatred
to
one
initiate
present
pointing
to
myself
and
seeks
his
life
not
only
as
a
child
of
the
star
not
only
as
husband
of
the
daughter
of
clavelta
but
for
a
reason
that
is
not
known
to
me
and
asked
another
chief
do
you
know
what
instrument
that
enemy
seeks
to
use
one
who
has
over
her
intended
victim
such
influence
as
few
of
her
sex
ever
have
over
their
lords
one
of
whom
his
love
will
learn
no
distrust
against
whom
his
heart
has
no
guard
and
his
manhood
no
wisdom
a
shiver
of
horror
passed
over
the
forms
of
the
chiefs
and
of
many
who
sat
near
them
incomprehensible
to
me
till
a
sudden
light
was
afforded
by
the
indignant
interruption
of
kevimâ
who
sat
not
far
from
myself
it
can
not
be
he
cried
or
you
can
name
her
whom
you
accuse
be
silent
esmo
said
in
the
cold
grave
tone
of
a
president
rebuking
disorder
mingled
with
the
deeper
displeasure
of
a
priest
repressing
irreverence
in
the
midst
of
the
most
solemn
religious
rite
none
may
speak
here
till
the
chiefs
have
ceased
to
speak
none
of
the
latter
however
seemed
disposed
to
ask
another
question
the
guilt
of
the
accused
was
confessed
all
that
he
could
tell
to
guide
their
further
inquiries
had
been
told
to
doubt
that
what
was
forced
from
him
was
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
true
was
to
them
who
understood
the
mysterious
power
that
had
compelled
the
spirit
and
the
lips
to
an
unwilling
confession
impossible
and
if
it
had
seemed
that
further
information
might
have
been
extracted
relative
to
my
own
personal
danger
a
stronger
tie
a
deeper
obligation
bound
them
to
the
supposed
object
of
the
last
obscure
imputation
and
none
was
willing
to
elicit
further
charges
or
clearer
evidence
probably
also
they
anticipated
that
when
the
word
was
extended
to
the
initiates
i
should
take
up
my
own
cause
would
any
brother
speak
asked
esmo
when
the
silence
of
the
chiefs
had
lasted
for
a
few
moments
but
his
rebuke
had
silenced
kevimâ
and
no
one
else
cared
to
interpose
the
eyes
of
the
assembly
turned
upon
me
so
generally
and
so
pointedly
that
at
last
i
felt
myself
forced
though
against
my
own
judgment
to
rise
i
have
no
question
to
ask
the
accused
i
said
then
replied
esmo
calmly
you
have
nothing
now
to
say
give
to
the
brother
accused
before
us
the
cup
of
rest
a
small
goblet
was
handed
by
one
of
the
sentries
to
the
miserable
creature
now
who
awaited
our
judgment
in
a
very
few
moments
he
had
sunk
into
a
slumber
in
which
his
face
was
comparatively
calm
and
his
limbs
had
ceased
to
tremble
his
fate
was
to
be
debated
in
the
presence
indeed
of
his
body
but
in
the
absence
of
consciousness
and
knowledge
has
any
elder
brother
inquired
esmo
counsel
to
afford
no
word
was
spoken
has
any
brother
counsel
to
afford
again
all
were
silent
till
the
glance
which
the
chief
cast
in
order
along
the
ranks
of
the
assembly
fell
upon
myself
one
word
i
said
i
claim
permission
to
speak
because
the
matter
touches
closely
and
cruelly
my
own
honour
there
was
that
inaudible
invisible
motionless
movement
as
some
french
reporters
call
it
of
surprise
throughout
the
assembly
which
communicates
itself
instinctively
to
a
speaker
my
own
honour
i
continued
in
the
honour
dearer
and
nearer
to
me
even
than
my
own
what
the
accused
has
spoken
may
or
may
not
be
true
it
is
true
interposed
a
chief
probably
pitying
my
ignorance
may
be
true
i
continued
though
i
will
not
believe
it
to
whomsoever
his
words
may
apply
that
no
such
treason
as
they
have
suggested
ever
for
one
moment
entered
or
could
enter
the
heart
of
her
who
knelt
with
me
in
presence
of
many
now
here
before
that
throne
i
will
vouch
by
all
the
symbols
we
revere
in
common
and
with
the
life
which
it
seems
is
alone
threatened
by
the
feminine
domestic
treason
alleged
from
whomsoever
that
treason
may
proceed
i
will
accuse
none
as
i
suspect
none
but
i
will
say
that
the
charge
might
be
true
to
the
letter
and
yet
not
touch
as
i
know
it
does
not
justly
touch
the
daughter
of
our
chief
a
deep
relief
was
visible
in
the
faces
which
had
so
lately
been
clouded
by
a
suspicion
terrible
to
all
esmo
alone
remained
impassive
throughout
my
vindication
as
throughout
the
apparent
accusation
and
silent
condemnation
of
his
daughter
has
any
brother
he
said
counsel
to
speak
respecting
the
question
actually
before
us
one
and
all
were
silent
till
esmo
again
put
the
formal
question
has
he
who
was
our
brother
betrayed
the
brotherhood
from
every
member
of
the
assembly
came
a
clear
unmistakable
assent
is
he
outcast
silence
rather
than
any
distinct
sign
answered
in
the
affirmative
is
it
needful
that
his
lips
be
sealed
for
ever
one
or
two
of
the
chiefs
expressed
in
a
single
sentence
an
affirmative
conviction
which
was
evidently
shared
by
all
present
except
myself
appealing
by
a
look
to
esmo
and
encouraged
by
his
eye
i
spoke
the
outcast
has
confessed
treason
worthy
of
death
that
i
can
not
deny
but
he
has
sinned
from
fear
rather
than
from
greed
or
malice
and
to
fear
courage
should
be
indulgent
the
coward
is
but
what
allah
has
made
him
and
to
punish
cowardice
is
to
punish
the
child
for
the
heritage
his
parents
have
inflicted
moreover
no
example
of
punishment
will
make
cowards
brave
it
seems
to
me
then
that
there
is
neither
justice
nor
wisdom
in
taking
vengeance
upon
the
crime
of
weakness
in
but
two
faces
those
of
esmo
and
of
his
next
colleague
on
the
left
could
i
see
the
slightest
sign
of
approval
one
of
the
other
chiefs
answered
briefly
and
decisively
my
plea
for
mercy
if
he
said
treason
proceed
from
fear
the
more
cause
that
a
greater
fear
should
prevent
the
treason
of
cowardice
for
the
future
the
same
motives
that
have
led
the
offender
to
betray
so
much
would
assuredly
lead
him
to
betray
more
were
he
released
and
to
attempt
lifelong
confinement
is
to
make
the
lives
of
all
dependent
on
a
chance
in
order
to
spare
one
unworthy
life
the
excuse
which
our
brother
has
pleaded
may
we
hope
avail
with
a
tribunal
which
can
regard
the
conscience
apart
from
the
consequences
it
ought
not
to
avail
with
us
but
the
law
of
the
zinta
as
i
now
learned
will
not
allow
sentence
of
death
to
be
passed
save
by
an
absolutely
unanimous
vote
it
is
held
that
if
one
judge
educated
in
the
ideas
of
the
order
appreciating
to
the
full
the
priceless
importance
of
its
teaching
and
the
guilt
of
treason
against
it
is
unpersuaded
that
there
exists
sufficient
cause
for
the
supreme
penalty
the
doubt
is
such
as
should
preclude
the
infliction
of
that
penalty
it
is
however
permitted
and
expected
that
the
dissentients
if
few
in
number
much
more
a
single
dissentient
shall
listen
attentively
and
give
the
most
respectful
and
impartial
consideration
to
the
arguments
of
brethren
and
especially
of
seniors
if
a
single
mind
remains
unmoved
its
dissent
is
decisive
but
it
would
be
the
gravest
dereliction
of
duty
to
persist
from
wilfulness
obstinacy
or
pride
in
adhesion
to
a
view
perhaps
hastily
expressed
in
opposition
to
authority
and
argument
the
debate
to
which
my
speech
gave
rise
lasted
for
two
hours
each
speaker
spoke
but
a
few
terse
expressive
sentences
and
after
each
speech
came
a
pause
allowing
full
time
for
the
consideration
of
its
reasoning
two
points
were
very
soon
made
clear
to
all
the
offender
had
justly
forfeited
his
life
and
if
his
death
were
necessary
or
greatly
conducive
to
the
safety
of
the
rest
the
mercy
which
for
his
sake
imperilled
worthier
men
and
sacred
truths
would
have
been
no
less
than
a
crime
the
thought
however
that
weighed
most
with
me
against
my
natural
feeling
was
an
experience
to
which
none
present
could
appeal
i
had
sat
on
many
where
cowardice
was
the
only
charge
imputed
and
in
every
case
in
which
that
charge
was
proved
sentence
of
death
had
been
passed
and
carried
out
on
a
ground
i
could
not
refuse
to
consider
sufficient
namely
that
the
infection
of
terror
can
best
be
repressed
by
an
example
inspiring
deeper
terror
than
that
to
which
the
prisoner
has
yielded
compelled
by
these
precedents
though
with
intense
reluctance
i
submitted
at
last
to
the
universal
judgment
esmo
having
collected
the
will
i
can
not
say
the
voices
of
the
assembly
paused
for
a
minute
in
silence
the
present
has
pronounced
he
said
at
last
are
the
voices
of
the
past
assentient
he
looked
around
as
if
to
see
whether
under
real
or
supposed
inspiration
any
of
those
before
him
would
give
in
another
name
a
judgment
opposite
to
that
in
which
all
had
concurred
instinctively
i
glanced
towards
the
throne
but
it
remained
vacant
as
ever
then
fixing
his
eyes
for
a
few
moments
upon
the
culprit
who
started
and
woke
to
full
consciousness
under
his
gaze
and
receiving
from
the
chief
nearest
to
him
on
the
left
a
chain
of
small
golden
circles
similar
to
that
of
the
canopy
represented
also
on
the
signet
while
he
on
the
right
held
a
small
roll

the
golden
surface

a
long
list
of

was
inscribed

breaking
at
the
appropriate
moment

chain
and
at
a
later
point

chapter
xxvi
twilight
i
was
perhaps
the
only
member
of
the
assembly
to
whom
the
doomed
man
was
not
personally
known
and
to
all
of
us
the
tie
which
had
been
severed
was
one
at
least
as
close
as
that
of
natural
brotherhood
on
earth
how
long
the
pause
lasted
how
or
why
or
when
we
resumed
our
seats
even
i
knew
not
the
shrine
was
unveiled
and
esmo
next
colleague
spoke
again
a
seat
among
the
elders
has
been
three
days
vacant
by
the
departure
of
one
well
known
and
dear
to
all
his
colleagues
have
considered
how
best
it
may
be
filled
the
member
they
have
selected
is
of
the
youngest
in
experience
here
but
from
the
first
moment
of
his
initiation
it
was
evident
to
us
that
more
than
half
the
learning
of
the
starlight
had
been
his
before
nothing
could
so
deeply
confirm
our
joy
and
confidence
in
that
lore
as
to
find
that
in
another
world
the
truths
we
hold
dearest
are
held
with
equal
faith
that
many
of
our
deepest
secrets
have
there
been
sought
and
discovered
by
societies
not
unlike
our
own
for
that
reason
and
because
of
that
house
whereof
now
but
two
members
are
left
us
he
is
by
wedlock
and
adoption
the
third
the
elder
brethren
have
unanimously
resolved
to
recommend
to
clavelta
and
to
the
children
of
the
star
that
this
seat
and
he
pointed
to
the
vacant
place
shall
be
filled
by
him
who
has
but
now
expressed
with
a
warmth
seldom
shown
in
this
place
his
love
and
trust
for
the
daughter
of
our
chief
the
descendant
of
our
founder
certainly
not
on
my
own
account
but
from
the
earnest
attachment
and
devotion
they
felt
for
esmo
both
personally
as
a
and
deservedly
revered
chief
and
as
almost
the
last
representative
of
a
lineage
so
profoundly
loved
and
honoured
the
approval
of
all
present
was
expressed
with
a
sudden
and
eager
warmth
which
deeply
affected
me
the
more
that
it
expressed
an
hereditary
regard
and
esteem
not
for
myself
but
for
eveena
rarely
or
never
even
among
the
zveltau
paid
to
a
woman
esmo
bent
his
head
in
assent
and
then
addressing
me
by
name
called
me
to
the
foot
of
the
platform
he
held
in
his
hand
the
golden
sash
and
wand
which
marked
the
rank
about
to
be
bestowed
on
me
i
felt
very
deeply
my
own
incompetence
and
ignorance
and
even
had
i
valued
more
the
proffered
honour
i
should
have
been
bound
to
decline
it
but
at
the
third
word
i
spoke
i
was
silenced
with
a
stern
though
perfectly
calm
severity
flinging
back
the
fold
of
his
robe
that
covered
his
left
arm
with
a
gesture
that
placed
the
signet
full
before
my
eyes
he
said
you
have
sworn
obedience
a
soldier
instinct
or
habit
the
mesmeric
command
of
esmo
glance
and
the
awe
due
less
to
my
own
feeling
than
to
the
infectious
reverence
of
others
which
the
symbols
and
the
oaths
of
the
order
extorted
left
me
no
further
will
to
resist
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
i
received
the
investiture
of
my
new
rank
and
as
i
rose
and
faced
my
brethren
every
hand
was
lifted
to
the
lips
every
head
bent
in
salutation
of
their
new
leader
then
as
i
passed
to
the
extreme
place
on
the
right
they
came
forward
to
grasp
my
hand
and
utter
a
few
words
of
sympathy
and
kindness
in
which
a
frank
spirit
of
affectionate
comradeship
that
reminded
me
forcibly
of
the
and
the
bivouac
fire
was
mingled
with
the
sense
of
a
deeper
and
more
sacred
tie
scarcely
had
we
resumed
our
places
than
a
startling
incident
gave
a
new
turn
to
the
scene
approaching
the
barrier
a
woman
veiled
but
wearing
the
sash
and
star
knelt
for
a
moment
to
the
presence
of
the
and
then
as
the
barrier
was
thrown
open
by
the
sentries
came
up
to
the
dais
she
said
the
has
a
message
for
you
clavelta
for
your
council
and
particularly
for
the
last
of
its
members
it
is
well
he
answered
the
messenger
took
her
seat
among
the
initiates
and
esmo
dismissed
the
assembly
in
the
solemn
form
employed
on
the
former
occasion
then
followed
by
the
twelve
and
guided
by
the
messenger
the
gloved
fingers
of
whose
left
hand
as
i
observed
he
very
slightly
touched
with
his
own
right
he
passed
by
another
door
out
of
the
hall
and
along
one
of
the
many
passages
of
the
subterrene
temple
into
a
chamber
resembling
in
every
respect
an
apartment
in
an
ordinary
residence
here
with
her
veil
as
is
permitted
only
to
maidenhood
drawn
back
from
her
face
but
covering
almost
entirely
her
neck
and
bosom
and
clad
in
the
vestal
white
reclined
with
eyes
nearly
closed
a
young
girl
in
whose
countenance
a
beauty
almost
spiritual
was
enhanced
rather
than
marred
by
signs
of
physical
painfully
unmistakable
warning
us
back
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
hand
esmo
approached
her
our
presence
had
at
first
seemed
to
cast
her
into
almost
convulsive
agitation
but
under
his
steady
gaze
and
the
movement
of
his
hands
she
lapsed
almost
instantly
into
what
appeared
to
be
profound
slumber
the
practical
information
that
concerned
the
present
peril
menacing
the
order
delivered
and
when
it
was
plain
that
no
further
revelation
or
counsel
was
to
be
expected
on
this
topic
esmo
beckoned
to
me
taking
my
hand
in
his
own
and
placing
it
very
gently
and
carefully
in
that
of
the
unconscious
sybil
the
effect
however
was
startling
without
unclosing
her
eyes
she
sprang
into
a
sitting
posture
and
clasped
my
hand
almost
convulsively
with
her
own
long
thin
all
but
transparent
fingers
turning
her
face
to
mine
and
seeming
though
her
eyes
were
closed
as
if
she
looked
intently
into
it
she
murmured
words
at
first
unintelligible
but
which
seemed
by
degrees
to
bear
clearer
and
clearer
reference
to
some
of
the
stormy
scenes
of
my
youth
in
another
world
then
as
one
looking
upon
pictures
but
partially
intelligible
to
her
and
commenting
on
them
as
a
girl
who
had
never
seen
or
known
the
passions
and
the
mutual
enmity
of
men
she
startled
me
by
breaking
into
the
kind
of
chant
in
which
the
peculiar
verse
of
her
language
is
commonly
delivered
my
own
thought
of
the
moment
was
not
her
guide
the
moslem
had
rung
too
often
in
my
ears
ever
to
be
forgotten
but
up
to
that
moment
i
had
never
recalled
to
memory
the
words
in
which
on
my
last
field
i
retorted
upon
my
arab
comrades
when
flinching
from
a
third
charge
against
those
terrible
sons
of
eblis
whose
stubborn
courage
had
already
twice
hurled
us
back
in
confusion
and
disgrace
with
a
hundred
empty
saddles
at
first
her
tone
was
one
of
simple
amaze
and
horror
it
softened
afterwards
into
wonder
and
perplexity
and
the
rebuke
or
curse
was
on
its
last
recurrence
spoken
with
more
of
pitying
tenderness
and
regret
than
of
severity
what
those
are
human
bosoms
whereon
the
brute
hath
trod
what
through
the
storm
of
slaughter
rings
the
appeal
to
god
through
the
smoke
and
flash
of
battle
a
single
form
is
shown
clang
and
crash
and
rattle
peals
out
one
for
allah
and
the
prophet
let
eblis
take
his
own
strange
the
soul
that
fresh
from
carnage
quailed
not
alone
to
face
the
unfathomed
depths
of
darkness
the
solitudes
of
space
strange
the
smile
of
scorn
while
nerveless
dropped
the
from
the
sting
on
the
death
that
scowled
at
distance
on
the
closing
strange
no
crimson
stain
on
conscience
from
the
hand
in
gore
imbrued
but
death
haunts
the
blood
taints
the
life

strange
the
arm
that
smote
and
spared
not
in
the
tempest
of
the
strife

pitying
terror

for
a

relaxing
but
not

of
my
own
hand

felt
about
with
her
left
till
esmo
gently
placed
his
own
therein
then
in
a
tone
at
first
of
deep
and
passionate
anxiety
and
eagerness
passing
into
one
of
regretful
admiration
and
varying
with
the
purport
of
each
utterance
she
broke
into
another
chant
in
which
were
repeated
over
and
again
phrases
familiar
in
the
traditions
and
prophetic
or
symbolic
formularies
of
the
zinta

the

fades
from
sight

for
ever
by
the
hand
that
veiled
the
shrine
and
on
a
peace
of
ages
the
star
of
peace

shine
esmo
listened
with
the
anxious
attention
of
one
who
believed
that
her
every
word
had
a
real
and
literal
meaning
and
his
face
was
overclouded
with
a
calm
but
deep
sadness
which
testified
to
the
nature
of
the
impression
made
on
his
mind
by
language
that
hardly
conveyed
to
my
own
more
than
a
dim
and
general
prediction
of
victory
won
through
scenes
of
trial
and
trouble
but
when
she
had
closed
a
quiet
satisfaction
in
what
seemed
to
be
the
final
promise
of
triumph
to
the
star
at
whatever
cost
to
the
noblest
of
its
adherents
was
all
that
i
could
trace
in
his
countenance
the
sibyl
fell
back
as
the
last
word
passed
her
lips
with
a
sigh
of
relief
into
what
was
evidently
a
profound
and
insensible
sleep
those
around
me
must
have
witnessed
such
scenes
at
least
as
often
as
i
but
it
was
plain
that
the
impression
made
even
on
the
experienced
chiefs
of
the
order
was
far
deeper
than
had
affected
myself
i
should
hardly
have
been
able
to
remember
the
words
of
the
prophecy
but
for
subsequent
conversation
thereon
with
eveena
when
one
part
had
been
fulfilled
and
the
rest
was
on
the
eve
of
a
too
terribly
truthful
fulfilment
but
for
the
events
that
fixed
their
prediction
in
my
mind
it
may
be
in
terms
a
little
more
precise
than
those
actually
employed
though
i
have
endeavoured
to
record
these
with
conscientious
accuracy
led
by
esmo
we
passed
along
another
gallery
into
the
small
chamber
where
met
the
secret
council
of
the
order
and
long
and
anxious
were
the
debates
wherein
the
revelations
of
the
dreamer
were
treated
as
conveying
the
most
certain
and
unquestionable
warning
the
first
rays
of
morning
were
stealing
through
the
mists
into
the
peristyle
of
our
host
dwelling
before
i
eveena
chamber
she
was
slumbering
but
restlessly
and
so
lightly
that
she
sprang
up
at
once
on
my
entrance
for
a
few
moments
all
other
thought
was
lost
in
the
delight
of
my
return
after
an
absence
whose
very
length
had
alarmed
her
despite
her
father
previous
assurance
but
as
at
last
she
drew
back
sufficiently
to
look
into
my
face
its
expression
seemed
to
startle
and
sadden
her
the
questions
that
sprang
to
her
lips
died
there
as
she
probably
saw
in
my
eyes
a
look
not
only
of
weariness
and
perplexity
but
of
profound
reluctance
to
speak
of
what
had
passed
expressing
her
sympathy
only
by
look
and
touch
she
began
to
unclasp
my
robe
at
the
throat
aware
that
my
only
wish
was
for
rest
and
content
to
postpone
her
own
anxiety
and
natural
curiosity
then
as
the
golden
sash
which
i
had
not
removed
met
her
sight
she
looked
up
for
a
moment
with
a
glance
of
natural
pride
and
fondness
intensely
gratified
by
the
honour
paid
to
her
husband
then
bent
low
and
kissed
my
hand
with
the
gesture
wherewith
the
presence
of
a
superior
is
acknowledged
by
the
members
of
the
order
used
as
my
earlier
life
was
eveena
to
the
eastern
prostrations
of
my
own
world
i
hate
all
that
recals
them
and
if
i
must
accept
as
i
fulfil
these
forms
in
the
halls
of
the
zinta
let
me
never
be
reminded
of
them
by
you
chapter
xxvii
the
valley
of
the
shadow
if
i
could
have
endured
to
describe
to
eveena
the
terrible
trial
scene
that
which
occurred
before
she
had
the
chance
to
question
me
would
have
certainly
sealed
my
lips
the
past
night
had
told
upon
me
as
no
fatigue
no
anxiety
no
disaster
of
my
life
on
earth
had
ever
done
i
awoke
faint
and
exhausted
as
a
nervous
valetudinarian
and
i
suppose
my
feeling
must
have
been
plainly
visible
in
my
face
for
eveena
would
not
allow
me
to
rise
from
the
cushions
till
she
had
summoned
an
and
procured
the
material
of
a
morning
meal
though
the
hour
was
noon
far
too
considerate
to
question
me
then
she
was
perhaps
a
little
disappointed
that
almost
before
i
had
dressed
a
message
from
her
father
summoned
me
to
his
presence
it
is
right
he
said
quietly
and
with
no
show
of
feeling
though
his
face
was
somewhat
pale
that
you
should
be
acquainted
with
the
fulfilment
of
the
sentence
you
assisted
to
pass
the
outcast
was
found
this
morning
dead
in
his
own
chamber
nay
you
need
not
start
we
need
no
deathsman
alike
by
sudden
disease
by
suicide
by
accident
our
doom
executes
itself
but
enough
of
this
i
accepted
the
vote
which
invested
you
with
the
second
rank
in
our
order
less
because
i
think
you
will
render
service
to
it
here
than
that
i
desired
you
to
possess
that
entire
knowledge
of
its
powers
and
secrets
which
might
enable
you
to
plant
a
branch
or
offshoot
where
none
but
you
could
carry
it
that
you
will
soon
leave
this
world
seemed
to
me
probable
before
the
anticipations
of
practical
prudence
were
confirmed
by
the
voice
of
prophecy
your
astronaut
shall
be
stored
with
all
of
which
i
know
you
have
need
and
with
any
materials
whose
use
i
do
not
know
that
you
may
point
out
to
remove
it
from
asnyea
would
now
be
too
dangerous
if
you
receive
tidings
that
shall
bring
you
again
into
its
neighbourhood
do
not
lose
the
opportunity
of
it
and
now
let
me
take
leave
of
you
as
of
a
dear
friend
i
may
not
meet
again
do
you
know
i
said
more
touched
by
the
tone
than
by
the
words
that
eveena
asked
and
i
gave
a
promise
that
when
i
do
it
she
shall
be
my
companion
i
did
not
know
it
but
i
took
for
granted
that
she
would
desire
it
and
i
should
have
been
grieved
to
doubt
that
you
would
assent
i
can
not
disturb
her
peace
by
saying
to
her
what
i
have
just
said
to
you
and
must
part
from
her
as
on
any
ordinary
occasion
that
parting
happily
i
did
not
witness
before
evening
we
our
vessel
and
returned
home
without
any
incident
worthy
of
mention
to
my
surprise
my
return
plunged
me
at
once
into
the
kind
of
vexation
which
eveena
had
so
anxiously
endeavoured
to
spare
me
and
which
i
had
hoped
eunané
greater
decision
and
less
exaggerated
tenderness
would
have
avoided
she
seemed
excited
and
almost
fretful
and
before
we
had
been
half
an
hour
at
home
had
greeted
me
with
a
string
of
complaints
which
on
her
own
showing
seemed
frivolous
and
argued
as
much
temper
on
her
part
as
customary
petulance
on
that
of
others
on
one
point
however
her
report
confirmed
the
suggestions
of
eveena
previous
experience
she
had
wrested
at
once
from
eivé
hand
the
pencil
that
had
hitherto
been
used
in
absolute
secrecy
and
the
consequent
quarrel
had
been
sharp
enough
to
suggest
if
not
to
prove
that
the
privilege
was
of
practical
as
well
as
sentimental
moment
though
aggravated
by
no
rebuke
my
tacit
depreciation
of
her
grievances
irritated
eunané
to
an
extreme
of
petulance
unusual
with
her
of
late
which
i
bore
so
long
as
it
was
directed
against
myself
but
which
turned
at
last
on
eveena
wholly
exhausted
my
patience
but
no
sooner
had
i
dismissed
the
offender
than
eveena
herself
interposed
with
even
more
than
her
usual
tenderness
for
eunané
do
not
blame
my
presumption
she
said
do
not
think
that
i
am
merely
soft
or
weak
if
i
entreat
you
to
take
no
further
notice
of
eunané
mood
i
can
not
but
think
that
if
you
do
you
will
very
soon
repent
it
she
could
not
or
would
not
give
a
reason
for
her
intercession
but
some
little
symptoms
i
might
have
seen
without
observing
some
perception
of
the
exceptional
character
of
eunané
outbreak
or
some
unacknowledged
misgiving
accordant
with
her
own
made
me
more
than
willing
to
accept
eveena
wish
as
a
sufficient
cause
for
forbearance
when
we
assembled
at
the
morning
meal
eunané
appeared
to
be
conscious
of
error
at
all
events
her
manner
and
temper
were
changed
watching
her
closely
i
thought
that
neither
shame
for
an
outbreak
of
unwonted
extravagance
nor
fear
of
my
displeasure
would
account
for
her
languor
and
depression
but
illness
is
so
rare
among
a
race
educated
for
countless
generations
on
principles
scientifically
sound
and
sanitary
inheriting
no
seeds
of
disease
from
their
ancestry
and
safe
from
the
infection
of
epidemics
long
extirpated
that
no
apprehension
of
serious
physical
cause
for
her
changes
of
temper
and
complexion
entered
into
my
mind
to
spare
her
when
she
deserved
no
indulgence
was
the
surest
way
to
call
forth
eunané
best
impulses
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
her
soon
after
the
party
had
dispersed
in
chamber
that
all
the
amends
i
could
desire
had
been
made
and
accepted
was
sufficiently
evident
but
eunané
agitation
was
so
violent
and
persistent
despite
all
eveena
soothing
that
i
was
at
last
seriously
apprehensive
of
its
effect
upon
the
latter
the
moment
we
were
alone
eveena
said
i
have
never
seen
illness
but
if
eunané
is
not
ill
and
very
ill
all
i
have
gathered
in
my
father
household
from
such
books
as
he
has
allowed
me
and
from
his
own
conversation
deceives
me
wholly
and
yet
no
illness
of
which
i
have
ever
heard
in
the
slightest
degree
resembles
this
i
take
it
to
be
i
said
what
on
earth
women
call
hysteria
and
men
temper
to
this
opinion
however
i
could
not
adhere
when
watching
her
closely
i
noticed
the
evident
lack
of
spirit
and
strength
with
which
the
most
active
and
energetic
member
of
the
household
went
about
her
usual
pursuits
a
terrible
suspicion
at
first
entered
my
mind
but
was
wholly
discountenanced
by
eveena
who
insisted
that
there
was
no
conceivable
motive
for
an
attempt
to
injure
eunané
while
the
idea
that
mischief
designed
for
others
had
unintentionally
fallen
on
her
was
excluded
by
the
certainty
that
whatever
the
nature
of
her
illness
if
it
were
such
it
had
commenced
before
our
return
long
before
evening
i
had
communicated
with
esmo
and
received
from
him
a
reply
which
though
exceedingly
unsatisfactory
rather
confirmed
eveena
impression
the
latter
had
taken
upon
herself
the
care
of
the
evening
meal
but
before
we
could
meet
there
my
own
observation
had
suggested
an
alarm
i
dared
not
communicate
to
her
one
which
a
wider
experience
than
hers
could
neither
verify
nor
dispel
among
symptoms
wholly
alien
there
were
one
or
two
which
sent
a
thrill
of
terror
to
my
heart
which
reminded
me
of
the
most
awful
and
destructive
of
the
scourges
wherewith
my
eastern
life
had
rendered
me
but
too
familiar
it
was
not
unnatural
that
if
carried
to
a
new
world
that
fearful
disease
should
assume
a
new
form
but
how
could
it
have
been
conveyed
how
if
conveyed
could
its
incubation
in
some
unknown
vehicle
have
been
so
long
and
how
had
it
reached
one
and
one
only
of
my
household
one
moreover
who
had
no
access
to
such
few
relics
of
my
own
world
as
i
had
retained
of
which
eveena
had
the
exclusive
charge
all
esmo
knowledge
even
were
he
within
reach
could
hardly
help
me
here
i
dared
of
course
suggest
my
apprehension
to
no
one
least
of
all
to
the
patient
herself
as
towards
evening
her
languor
was
again
exchanged
for
the
feverish
excitement
of
the
previous
night
i
seized
on
some
petulant
word
as
an
excuse
to
confine
her
to
her
room
and
selfishly
enough
resolved
to
invoke
the
help
of
the
only
member
of
the
family
who
should
and
perhaps
would
be
willing
to
run
personal
risk
for
the
sake
of
aiding
eunané
in
need
and
protecting
eveena
i
had
seen
as
yet
very
little
of
velna
eunané
school
companion
but
now
calling
her
apart
i
told
her
frankly
that
i
feared
some
illness
of
my
own
earth
had
by
some
means
been
communicated
to
her
friend
you
have
here
i
said
for
ages
had
no
such
diseases
as
those
which
we
on
earth
most
dread
those
which
communicated
through
water
air
or
solid
particles
spread
from
one
person
to
another
endangering
especially
those
who
come
nearest
to
the
sufferers
whoever
approaches
eunané
risks
all
that
i
fear
for
her
and
that
means
very
probably
speedy
death
to
leave
her
alone
is
impossible
and
if
i
can
not
report
that
she
is
fully
cared
for
in
other
hands
no
command
nothing
short
of
actual
compulsion
will
keep
eveena
away
from
her
the
girl
looked
up
with
a
steady
frank
courage
and
unaffected
readiness
i
had
not
expected
i
owe
you
much
clasfempta
and
still
more
perhaps
to
eveena
my
life
is
not
so
precious
that
i
should
not
be
ready
to
give
it
at
need
for
either
of
you
and
if
i
should
lose
eunané
i
would
prefer
not
to
live
to
remember
my
loss
the
last
words
reminded
me
that
to
her
who
spoke
death
meant
annihilation
a
fact
which
has
deprived
the
men
of
her
race
of
nearly
every
vestige
of
the
calm
courage
now
displayed
by
this
young
girl
indebted
as
little
as
any
human
being
could
be
to
the
insensible
influences
of
home
affection
or
the
direct
moral
teaching
which
is
sometimes
supposed
to
be
a
sufficient
substitute
i
led
her
at
once
into
her
friend
chamber
and
a
single
glance
satisfied
me
that
my
apprehensions
were
but
too
remaining
long
enough
to
assure
the
sufferer
that
the
displeasure
i
had
affected
had
wholly
passed
away
and
to
suggest
the
only
measures
of
relief
rather
than
of
remedy
that
occurred
to
me
i
endeavoured
for
a
few
moments
to
collect
my
thoughts
and
recover
the
control
of
my
nerves
in
solitude
in
my
own
chamber
eveena
would
assuredly
have
sought
me
and
i
chose
therefore
one
of
those
as
yet
unoccupied
it
did
not
take
long
to
convince
me
that
no
ordinary
resources
at
my
command
no
medical
experience
of
my
own
no
professional
science
existing
among
a
race
who
probably
never
knew
the
disease
in
question
and
had
not
for
ages
known
anything
like
it
could
avail
me
my
later
studies
in
the
occult
science
of
eastern
schools
had
not
furnished
me
with
any
antidote
in
which
i
believed
on
earth
and
if
they
had
it
was
not
here
available
despair
rather
than
hope
suggested
an
appeal
to
those
which
the
analogous
secrets
of
the
starlight
might
afford
anxiety
agitation
personal
interest
so
powerful
as
now
disturbed
me
are
generally
fatal
to
the
exercise
of
the
powers
recently
placed
at
my
command
so
recently
that
but
for
terrestrial
experience
i
should
hardly
have
known
how
to
use
them
but
the
arts
which
assist
in
and
facilitate
that
tremendous
concentration
of
will
on
which
the
exertion
of
those
powers
depends
are
far
more
fully
developed
in
the
zveltic
science
than
in
its
earthly
analogues
a
desperate
effort
aided
by
those
arts
at
last
controlled
my
thoughts
and
turned
them
from
the
to
that
distant
chamber
in
which
i
had
so
lately
stood
i
seemed
to
stand
beside
her
and
at
once
to
be
aware
that
my
thought
was
visible
to
the
closed
eyes
from
lips
paler
than
ever
words
so
generally
resembling
those
i
had
previously
heard
that
some
readers
may
think
them
the
mere
recollection
thereof
appeared
to
reach
my
sense
or
my
mind
as
from
a
great
distance
spoken
in
a
tone
of
mingled
pity
promise
and
reproof
what
is
youth
or
sex
or
beauty
in
the
sight
for
the
arm
that
smote
and
spared
not
shall
his
wisdom
spare
to
smite
yet
love
redeems
the
loving
yet
in
thy
need
avail
the
soul
whose
light
surrounds
thee
the
faith
that
will
not
fail
thy
lips
shall
soothe
the
terror
call
to
yon
couch
afar
the
solace
of
the
serpent
the
shadow
of
the
star
strength
shall
sustain
the
strengthless
nor
the
soft
hand
loose
its
grasp
of
the
hand
it
trusts
and
clings
to
till
another
meet
its
clasp
to
man
last
anguish
to
woman
mood
death
quits
not
the
blood
haunts
the
life
of
blood
returning
to
the
peristyle
i
encountered
eveena
who
had
been
seeking
me
anxiously
much
alarmed
for
her
i
bade
her
return
at
once
to
her
room
she
obeyed
as
of
course
equally
of
course
surprised
and
a
little
mortified
while
i
marvelling
by
what
conceivable
means
the
plague
of
cairo
or
constantinople
could
have
been
conveyed
across
forty
million
miles
of
space
and
some
two
years
of
earthly
time
paced
the
peristyle
for
a
few
minutes
as
i
did
so
my
eye
fell
on
the
roses
which
grew
just
where
chance
arrested
my
steps
if
they
do
not
afford
an
explanation
which
scientific
medicine
will
admit
i
can
suggest
no
other
but
if
it
were
so
how
fearfully
true
the
warning
by
what
a
mysterious
fate
did
death
dog
my
footsteps
and
blood
haunt
the
life
of
blood
the
reader
may
not
remember
that
the
central
chamber
of
the
apartments
next
to
which
was
eunané
had
been
left
vacant
this
i
determined
to
occupy
myself
and
bade
the
girls
remove
at
once
to
those
on
its
right
as
yet
unallotted
i
closed
the
room
threw
off
my
dress
and
endeavoured
by
means
of
the
perfumed
to
drive
from
my
person
what
traces
of
the
infection
might
cling
to
it
for
eveena
had
the
keys
of
all
my
cases
and
of
the
and
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
reclaim
them
by
a
simple
unexplained
message
sent
by
an
ambâ
or
still
worse
by
the
hands
of
enva
or
eivé
i
laid
the
clothes
i
had
worn
on
one
of
the
shelves
of
the
wall
closing
over
them
the
crystal
doors
of
the
sunken
cupboard
and
having
obtained
through
the
amban
a
dress
which
i
had
not
worn
since
my
return
and
which
therefore
could
hardly
have
about
it
any
trace
of
infection
i
sought
eveena
in
her
own
room
that
something
had
gone
wrong
and
gravely
wrong
she
could
not
but
know
and
i
found
her
silent
and
calm
indeed
but
weeping
bitterly
whether
for
the
apprehension
of
danger
to
me
or
for
what
seemed
want
of
trust
in
her
i
asked
her
for
the
keys
and
she
gave
them
but
with
a
mute
appeal
that
made
the
concealment
i
desired
however
necessary
no
longer
possible
gently
cautiously
as
i
could
but
softening
not
hiding
any
part
of
the
truth
i
gave
her
the
full
confidence
to
which
she
was
entitled
and
which
once
forced
out
of
the
silence
preserved
for
her
sake
it
was
an
infinite
relief
to
give
if
i
could
not
observe
equal
gentleness
of
word
and
manner
in
absolutely
forbidding
her
to
approach
either
eunané
chamber
or
my
own
it
was
because
the
moment
she
conceived
what
i
was
about
to
say
her
almost
indignant
revolt
from
the
command
was
apparent
for
the
first
and
last
time
she
distinctly
and
firmly
refused
compliance
not
merely
with
the
kindly
though
very
decided
request
at
first
spoken
but
with
the
formal
and
peremptory
command
by
which
i
endeavoured
to
enforce
it
you
command
me
to
neglect
a
sister
in
peril
and
suffering
she
said
it
is
not
kind
it
is
hardly
worthy
of
you
but
my
first
duty
is
to
you
and
you
have
the
right
if
you
will
to
insist
that
i
shall
reserve
my
life
for
your
sake
but
you
command
me
also
to
forsake
you
in
danger
and
in
sorrow
and
nothing
but
the
absolute
force
you
may
of
course
employ
shall
compel
me
to
obey
you
in
that
i
understand
you
eveena
and
you
in
your
turn
must
think
and
feel
that
i
intend
to
express
neither
displeasure
nor
pain
that
i
mean
no
harshness
to
you
no
less
respect
as
well
as
love
than
i
have
always
shown
you
when
i
say
that
obey
you
shall
that
the
same
sense
of
duty
which
impels
you
to
refuse
obliges
me
to
enforce
my
command
at
no
time
would
i
have
allowed
you
to
risk
your
life
where
others
might
be
available
but
if
you
were
the
only
one
who
could
help
i
should
under
other
circumstances
have
felt
that
the
same
paramount
duty
that
attaches
to
me
attached
in
a
lighter
degree
to
yourself
now
as
you
well
know
the
case
is
different
and
even
were
eunané
not
quite
safe
in
my
hands
and
in
velna
you
must
not
run
a
risk
that
can
be
avoided
you
will
promise
me
to
remain
on
this
side
the
peristyle
or
in
the
further
half
of
it
or
i
must
confine
you
perforce
and
it
is
not
kind
or
right
in
this
hour
of
trouble
to
impose
upon
me
so
painful
a
task
with
every
tone
look
and
caress
that
could
express
affection
and
sympathy
eveena
answered
do
what
seems
your
duty
and
do
not
think
that
i
misunderstand
your
motive
or
feel
the
shadow
of
humiliation
or
unkindness
make
me
obey
if
you
can
punish
me
if
i
disobey
but
obey
you
when
you
tell
me
for
my
own
life
sake
or
for
any
other
to
desert
you
in
the
hour
of
need
of
danger
and
of
sorrow
i
neither
will
nor
can
i
cut
short
the
scene
bidding
her
a
passionate
farewell
in
view
of
the
probability
that
we
should
not
meet
again
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
having
called
her
whom
at
this
moment
and
in
this
case
i
could
best
trust
because
her
worse
as
well
as
her
better
qualities
were
alike
guarantees
for
her
obedience
enva
i
said
you
will
keep
this
room
till
i
release
you
and
you
will
answer
it
to
me
as
the
worst
fault
you
can
commit
if
eveena
passes
this
threshold
under
whatever
circumstances
until
i
give
her
permission
or
until
if
it
be
beyond
my
power
to
give
it
her
father
takes
the
responsibilities
of
my
home
upon
himself
i
procured
the
sedatives
which
might
relieve
the
suffering
i
could
not
hope
to
cure
i
wrote
to
esmo
stating
briefly
but
fully
the
position
as
i
conceived
it
and
on
a
suggestion
from
eivé
i
despatched
another
message
to
a
female
physician
of
some
repute
one
of
those
few
women
in
mars
who
lead
the
life
and
do
the
work
of
men
and
for
whose
attendance
as
i
remembered
eunané
had
expressed
a
strong
theoretical
preference
from
that
time
i
scarcely
left
her
chamber
save
for
a
few
minutes
and
velna
remained
constantly
at
her
friend
side
save
when
to
give
her
at
least
a
chance
of
escape
i
sent
her
to
her
room
to
bathe
change
her
dress
and
seek
the
fresh
air
for
the
half
hour
during
which
alone
i
could
persuade
her
to
leave
the
sufferer
the
physician
came
but
on
learning
the
nature
of
the
disease
expressed
intense
indignation
that
she
had
been
summoned
to
a
position
of
so
much
danger
to
herself
i
answered
by
a
contemptuous
inquiry
regarding
the
price
for
which
she
would
run
so
much
risk
as
to
remain
in
the
peristyle
so
long
as
i
might
have
need
of
her
presence
and
for
a
fee
which
would
ensure
her
a
as
large
as
that
secured
to
eveena
herself
she
consented
to
remain
within
speaking
distance
for
the
few
hours
in
which
the
question
must
be
decided
eunané
was
seldom
insensible
or
even
delirious
and
her
quick
intelligence
caught
very
speedily
the
meaning
of
my
close
attendance
and
of
the
distress
which
neither
velna
nor
i
could
wholly
conceal
she
asked
and
extracted
from
me
what
i
knew
of
the
origin
of
her
illness
and
answered
with
a
far
stronger
feeling
than
i
should
have
expected
even
from
her
if
i
am
to
die
i
am
glad
it
should
be
through
trying
to
serve
and
please
eveena
it
may
seem
strange
clasfempta
she
went
on
presently
scarcely
possible
perhaps
but
my
love
for
her
is
not
only
greater
than
the
love
i
bear
you
but
is
so
bound
up
with
it
that
i
always
think
of
you
together
and
love
you
the
better
that
i
love
her
and
that
you
love
her
so
much
better
than
me
but
she
resumed
later
it
is
hard
to
die
and
die
so
young
i
had
never
known
what
happiness
meant
till
i
came
here
i
have
been
so
happy
here
and
i
was
happier
each
day
in
feeling
that
i
no
longer
made
eveena
or
you
less
happy
ah
let
me
thank
you
and
eveena
while
i
can
for
everything
and
above
all
for
velna
but
after
another
long
pause
it
is
terrible
and
horrible
never
to
wake
to
move
to
hear
your
voices
to
see
you
to
look
upon
the
sunlight
to
think
or
even
to
dream
again
once
to
remove
a
tooth
and
straighten
the
rest
they
made
me
senseless
and
that
sinking
into
senselessness
though
i
knew
i
should
waken
in
a
minute
was
horrible
and
to
sink
into
senselessness
from
which
i
shall
never
waken
she
was
sinking
fast
indeed
and
this
terror
of
death
so
seldom
seen
in
the
dying
grew
apparently
deeper
and
more
intense
as
death
drew
near
i
could
not
bear
it
and
at
last
took
my
resolve
and
dismissed
velna
forbidding
her
to
return
till
summoned
ah
said
eunané
you
send
her
away
that
she
may
not
see
the
last
is
it
so
near
no
darling
i
replied
she
like
eveena
had
learnt
the
meaning
of
one
or
two
expressions
of
human
affection
in
my
own
tongue
but
i
have
that
to
say
which
i
would
not
willingly
say
in
her
presence
you
dread
death
not
as
a
short
terrible
pain
and
for
you
it
will
not
be
so
not
as
a
short
sleep
but
as
eternal
senselessness
and
nothingness
has
it
never
seemed
to
you
strange
that
loving
eveena
as
i
do
do
not
fear
to
die
though
you
did
not
know
it
i
have
lived
almost
since
first
you
knew
me
under
the
threat
of
death
and
death
sudden
secret
without
warning
menacing
me
every
day
and
every
hour
and
yet
though
death
meant
leaving
her
and
leaving
her
to
a
fate
i
could
not
foresee
i
have
been
able
to
look
on
it
steadily
kneeling
here
i
know
that
i
am
very
probably
giving
my
life
to
the
same
end
as
yours
i
do
not
fear
that
may
not
seem
strange
to
you
but
eveena
knows
all
i
know
and
i
could
scarcely
keep
eveena
away
so
loving
each
other
do
not
fear
to
die
because
we
believe
we
know
that
that
in
us
which
thinks
and
feels
and
loves
will
live
that
in
death
we
lay
aside
the
body
as
we
lay
aside
our
clothing
if
i
thought
otherwise
eunané
i
could
not
bear
parting
she
clasped
my
hands
almost
as
much
surprised
and
touched
i
thought
for
the
moment
by
the
expression
of
an
affection
of
which
till
that
hour
neither
of
us
were
fully
aware
as
by
the
marvellous
and
incredible
assurance
she
had
heard
ah
she
said
i
have
heard
her
people
are
strange
and
they
dream
such
things
no
clasfempta
it
is
a
fancy
or
you
say
it
to
comfort
me
not
because
it
is
true
the
expression
of
terror
that
again
came
over
her
face
was
too
painful
for
endurance
to
calm
that
terror
i
would
have
broken
every
oath
have
risked
every
penalty
but
in
truth
i
could
never
have
paused
to
ask
what
in
such
a
case
oath
or
law
permitted
listen
eunané
i
said
and
be
calm
not
only
eveena
not
only
i
but
hundreds
thousands
of
the
best
and
kindliest
men
and
women
of
your
world
hold
this
faith
as
fast
as
we
do
you
feel
what
eveena
is
what
she
is
and
what
others
are
not
she
owes
to
this
trust
to
the
assurance
of
a
power
unseen
that
rules
our
lives
and
fortunes
and
watches
our
conduct
that
will
exact
an
account
thereof
that
holds
us
as
his
children
and
will
never
part
with
us
do
you
think
it
is
a
lie
that
has
made
eveena
what
she
is
but
you
you
do
not
know
yes
i
know
i
have
seen
here
a
touch
breaking
suddenly
upon
that
intense
concentration
of
mind
and
soul
on
a
single
thought
violently
startled
me
gentle
as
it
was
and
to
my
horror
i
saw
that
eveena
was
kneeling
with
me
by
the
couch
remember
she
said
in
the
lowest
saddest
whisper
veil
that
guards
the
shrine
no
matter
eveena
i
answered
in
the
same
tone
the
pain
at
my
heart
suppressing
even
the
impulse
of
indignation
not
with
her
but
with
the
law
that
could
put
such
a
thought
into
her
heart
neither
penalty
nor
oath
should
silence
me
now
whether
i
break
our
law
i
know
not
but
i
would
forfeit
life
here
i
would
forfeit
life
hereafter
rather
than
fail
a
soul
that
rests
on
mine
at
such
a
moment
the
clasp
of
her
hand
showed
how
thoroughly
despite
the
momentary
doubt
she
felt
with
me
and
i
could
not
now
recur
to
that
secondary
selfishness
which
had
so
imperiously
repelled
her
from
the
i
have
seen
i
repeated
as
eunané
still
looked
earnestly
into
my
face
and
eveena
has
seen
at
the
same
moment
one
long
ages
since
departed
this
world
the
teacher
of
this
belief
the
founder
of
that
society
which
holds
it
the
ancestor
of
her
own
house
in
bodily
form
before
us
it
is
true
said
eveena
in
answer
to
eunané
appealing
look
and
i
i
added
have
seen
more
than
once
in
my
own
world
the
forms
of
those
i
have
known
in
life
recalled
according
to
promise
to
human
eyes
the
testimony
or
the
contagion
of
the
strong
undoubting
confidence
we
felt
therein
if
they
did
not
convince
the
intellect
changed
the
tone
of
thought
and
feeling
of
the
dying
girl
too
weak
now
to
reason
or
to
resist
the
impression
enforced
upon
her
mind
by
minds
always
far
more
powerful
than
her
own
in
its
brightest
hours
she
turned
instinctively
from
the
thought
of
blackness
senselessness
eternal
to
that
of
a
father
whose
hand
could
uphold
of
the
wings
that
can
leap
the
grave
her
left
hand
clasped
in
mine
her
right
in
eveena
looking
most
in
my
face
because
weakness
leant
on
strength
even
more
than
love
appealed
to
love
eunané
spent
the
remaining
hours
of
that
night
in
calm
contentment
and
peace
perhaps
they
were
among
the
most
perfectly
peaceful
and
happy
she
had
known
to
strong
warm
sheltering
affection
she
had
never
been
used
save
in
her
new
home
and
in
the
love
she
received
and
returned
there
was
much
too
strange
and
to
be
satisfactory
but
no
shadow
of
jealousy
doubt
or
contradictory
emotion
troubled
her
now
assured
of
sisterly
love
as
of
my
own
hardly
and
lately
won
trust
and
tenderness
the
light
had
been
long
subdued
and
the
chamber
was
dim
as
dimmest
twilight
when
suddenly
with
a
smile
eunané
cried
it
is
morning
already
and
there
why
there
is
erme
she
stretched
out
her
arms
as
if
to
greet
the
one
creature
she
had
loved
perhaps
more
dearly
than
she
loved
those
now
beside
her
the
hands
dropped
and
eveena
closed
for
ever
on
the
sights
of
this
world
the
eyes
whose
last
vision
had
been
of
another
chapter
xxviii
darker
yet
leading
eveena
from
the
room
i
hastily
dictated
every
precaution
that
could
diminish
the
danger
to
her
and
others
velna
had
run
risks
that
could
not
well
be
increased
and
on
her
and
on
myself
must
devolve
what
remained
to
be
done
i
sent
an
ambâ
to
summon
davilo
gathered
the
garments
that
eveena
had
thrown
off
and
removed
them
to
the
when
the
first
arrangements
were
made
and
i
had
paid
the
fee
of
astona
the
i
passed
out
into
the
garden
and
davilo
met
me
at
the
door
of
the
peristyle
a
few
words
explained
all
that
was
necessary
it
was
still
almost
dark
and
as
we
stood
close
by
the
door
speaking
in
the
low
tone
partly
of
sadness
partly
of
precaution
two
figures
were
dimly
discernible
just
inside
and
we
caught
a
few
broken
words
you
have
heard
said
a
harsh
voice
which
seemed
to
be
astona
there
is
no
doubt
now
you
have
your
part
to
play
and
can
do
it
quickly
and
safely
i
paid
little
attention
to
words
whose
dangerous
significance
would
at
another
moment
have
been
plain
to
me
but
davilo
greatly
alarmed
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
as
he
did
so
another
voice
thrilled
me
with
intensest
pain
and
amazement
be
quick
to
bear
your
message
eivé
said
in
rapid
guarded
tones
they
have
means
of
vengeance
certain
and
prompt
and
they
never
spare
astona
departed
without
seeing
us
eivé
closed
the
door
and
davilo
and
i
hastily
and
unperceived
followed
the
spy
to
the
gate
of
the
enclosure
some
one
waited
for
her
there
what
passed
we
could
not
hear
but
as
we
saw
astona
and
another
depart
davilo
spoke
imprudently
aloud
she
has
the
secret
and
she
must
die
as
i
would
have
expostulated
she
is
spy
traitress
and
assassin
and
merits
her
doom
most
richly
hist
said
i
your
words
may
have
fallen
into
other
ears
for
i
thought
that
beyond
the
wall
i
discerned
a
crouching
figure
if
that
of
a
man
however
it
was
too
far
off
and
dressed
in
colours
too
dark
to
be
clearly
seen
and
in
another
instant
it
had
certainly
vanished
remember
he
urged
you
have
heard
that
one
quite
as
dangerous
is
under
your
own
roof
and
once
more
it
is
not
only
your
life
that
is
at
stake
what
you
call
courage
what
seems
to
us
sheer
folly
may
cost
you
and
others
what
you
value
far
more
than
your
life
an
error
of
softness
now
may
make
your
future
existence
one
long
and
useless
remorse
later
having
warned
the
women
to
their
rooms
ordering
a
variety
of
disinfecting
measures
in
which
martial
science
excelled
while
they
were
needed
there
i
opened
the
door
of
the
death
chamber
to
those
who
carried
in
a
coffer
hollowed
out
of
a
dark
exceedingly
dense
natural
stone
and
with
a
liquid
of
enormous
destructive
power
then
i
lifted
tenderly
the
lifeless
form
laid
it
on
cushions
arranged
therein
kissed
the
lips
and
closed
the
coffer
two
of
davilo
attendants
had
meantime
adjusted
the
electric
machinery
we
carried
the
coffer
into
the
apartment
where
this
worked
to
heat
the
stove
to
keep
the
lights
burning
to
raise
warm
and
diffuse
the
water
through
the
house
and
perform
many
other
important
household
services
two
strong
bars
of
conducting
metal
were
attached
to
the
apparatus
and
fitted
into
two
hollows
of
the
coffer
a
flash
a
certain
hissing
sound
followed
after
a
few
moments
the
coffer
was
opened
and
davilo
carefully
gathering
a
few
handfuls
of
solid
white
material
something
resembling
pumice
stone
in
appearance
placed
them
in
a
golden
chest
about
twelve
inches
cube
which
was
then
soldered
down
by
the
heat
derived
from
the
electric
power
then
all
infected
clothes
and
the
contents
of
the
death
chamber
were
carried
out
for
destruction
while
with
a
tool
adjusted
to
the
machinery
one
of
the
attendants
engraved
a
few
characters
upon
the
chest
whatever
the
risk
i
could
not
part
with
every
relic
of
her
we
had
lost
and
after
passing
them
through
such
chemical
purification
as
martial
science
suggested
i
took
the
three
long
chestnut
locks
i
had
preserved
velna
quick
fingers
wove
them
into
plaits
one
of
which
i
left
with
her
one
bound
around
my
own
neck
and
one
reserved
for
eveena
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
risen
i
had
despatched
a
message
to
the
prince
explaining
the
danger
of
infection
to
which
i
had
been
subjected
and
asking
permission
notwithstanding
to
wait
upon
him
the
emergency
was
so
pressing
that
neither
sorrow
nor
peril
would
allow
me
to
neglect
an
embassy
on
which
the
lives
of
hundreds
and
perhaps
the
safety
of
his
kingdom
might
depend
passing
eivé
as
i
turned
towards
eveena
room
and
fevered
with
intense
thirst
i
bade
her
bring
me
thither
a
cup
of
the
carcarâ
i
need
not
dwell
on
the
terribly
painful
moments
in
which
i
bound
round
eveena
arm
a
bracelet
prized
above
all
the
choicest
ornaments
she
possessed
to
calm
her
agitation
and
my
own
by
means
of
the
charny
i
sought
the
keys
they
were
not
at
my
belt
and
i
asked
have
i
returned
them
to
you
certainly
not
said
eveena
startled
can
you
not
find
them
at
this
moment
eivé
entered
the
room
and
presented
me
with
the
cup
for
which
i
had
asked
it
struck
me
with
surprise
even
at
that
moment
that
eveena
took
it
from
my
hand
and
carried
it
first
to
her
own
lips
eivé
had
turned
to
leave
the
room
but
before
she
had
reached
the
threshold
eveena
had
sprung
up
placed
her
foot
upon
the
spring
that
closed
the
door
and
snatching
the
from
my
watch
chain
dipped
it
into
the
cup
her
face
turned
white
as
death
while
she
held
up
to
my
eyes
the
discoloured
disc
which
proved
the
presence
of
the
deadliest
martial
poison
be
calm
she
said
as
a
cry
of
horror
burst
from
my
lips
the
keys
have
them
eivé
said
with
a
gasp
her
face
still
averted
i
took
them
from
eveena
myself
i
answered
sternly
stand
back
into
that
corner
eivé
as
i
opened
the
door
and
called
sharply
the
other
members
of
the
household
when
they
entered
unable
to
stand
i
had
fallen
back
upon
a
chair
and
called
eivé
to
my
side
as
i
laid
my
hand
on
her
arm
she
threw
herself
on
the
floor
screaming
and
writhing
like
a
terrified
child
rather
than
a
woman
detected
in
a
crime
the
conception
and
execution
of
which
must
have
required
an
evil
courage
and
determination
happily
seldom
possessed
by
women
stand
up
i
said
lift
her
then
enva
and
eiralé
unfasten
the
and
zone
as
her
outer
robe
dropped
eivé
snatched
at
an
object
in
its
folds
but
too
late
and
the
electric
keys
which
gave
access
to
all
my
cases
papers
and
to
the
above
all
lay
glittering
on
the
ground
that
cup
eivé
brought
to
me
which
of
you
saw
her
i
did
said
enva
quietly
all
feelings
of
malice
and
curiosity
alike
awed
into
silence
by
the
evidence
of
some
terrible
though
as
yet
to
them
unknown
secret
she
mixed
it
and
brought
it
hither
herself
and
i
said
it
contains
a
poison
against
which
had
i
drunk
the
draught
no
antidote
could
have
availed
a
poison
to
which
these
keys
only
could
have
given
access
again
the
was
applied
and
again
the
discoloration
testified
to
the
truth
of
the
charge
you
have
seen
i
said
we
have
seen
answered
enva
in
the
same
tone
of
horror
too
deep
to
be
other
than
quiet
we
all
left
the
room
closing
the
door
upon
the
prisoner
dismissing
the
girls
to
their
own
chambers
with
strict
injunctions
not
to
quit
them
unpermitted
i
was
left
alone
with
eveena
we
were
silent
for
some
minutes
my
own
heart
oppressed
with
mingled
emotions
all
intensely
painful
but
so
confused
that
while
conscious
of
acute
suffering
i
scarcely
realised
anything
that
had
occurred
eveena
who
knelt
beside
me
though
deeply
was
less
surprised
and
was
far
less
agitated
than
i
at
last
leaning
forward
with
her
arms
on
my
knee
and
looking
up
in
my
face
she
was
about
to
speak
but
the
touch
and
look
seemed
to
break
a
spell
and
shuddering
from
head
to
foot
i
burst
into
tears
like
those
of
an
hysterical
girl
when
with
the
strongest
effort
that
shame
and
necessity
could
prompt
aided
by
her
silent
soothing
i
had
somewhat
regained
my
eveena
spoke
in
the
same
attitude
and
with
the
same
look
you
said
once
that
you
could
pardon
such
an
attempt
that
you
should
ever
forgive
at
heart
can
not
be
that
punishment
should
not
follow
so
terrible
a
crime
even
i
can
not
desire
but
for
sake
do
not
give
her
up
to
the
doom
she
has
deserved
do
you
know
as
i
was
silent
what
that
doom
is
death
i
suppose
yes
she
said
shuddering
but
death
with
torture
death
on
the
will
you
whatever
the
danger
you
give
up
to
such
a
fate
to
such
hands
one
whom
your
hand
has
caressed
whose
head
has
rested
on
your
heart
it
needs
not
that
eveena
i
answered
enough
that
she
is
woman
i
would
face
that
death
myself
rather
than
for
whatever
crime
send
a
woman
above
all
a
young
girl
to
such
an
end
i
would
rather
by
far
slay
my
worst
enemy
with
my
own
hand
than
consign
him
to
a
death
of
torture
but
more
than
that
my
conscience
would
not
permit
me
to
call
on
the
law
to
punish
a
household
treason
where
household
authority
is
so
strong
and
so
arbitrary
as
here
assassination
is
the
weapon
of
the
oppressed
and
helpless
and
it
is
not
for
me
so
to
be
judge
in
my
own
cause
as
to
pronounce
that
eivé
has
had
no
provocation
shame
upon
her
said
eveena
indignantly
no
one
under
your
roof
ever
had
or
could
have
reason
to
raise
a
hand
i
do
not
say
against
your
life
but
to
give
you
a
moment
pain
i
do
not
ask
i
do
not
wish
you
to
spare
her
only
i
am
glad
to
think
you
will
deal
with
her
yourself
remember
she
has
herself
removed
all
limit
to
your
power
and
not
by
the
shameless
and
merciless
hands
to
which
the
law
would
give
her
we
returned
to
eveena
chamber
the
scene
that
followed
i
can
not
bear
to
recall
enough
that
eivé
knew
as
well
as
eveena
the
law
she
had
broken
and
the
penalty
she
had
incurred
and
petted
darling
as
she
had
been
she
utterly
lacked
all
faith
in
the
tenderness
she
had
known
so
well
or
even
in
the
mercy
to
which
eveena
had
confidently
appealed
understanding
at
last
that
she
was
safe
from
the
law
the
expression
of
her
gratitude
was
as
vehement
as
her
terror
had
been
intense
but
the
new
phase
of
passion
was
not
the
less
repugnant
not
that
there
was
anything
strange
in
the
violent
revulsion
of
feeling
born
and
trained
among
a
race
who
fear
to
forgive
eivé
was
familiar
by
report
at
least
with
the
merciless
vengeance
of
cowards
whatever
they
might
have
done
later
few
would
have
promised
mercy
in
the
very
moment
of
escape
to
an
ordinary
assassin
and
if
eivé
understood
any
aspect
of
my
character
that
she
could
best
appreciate
was
the
outraged
tenderness
which
forbade
me
to
look
on
hers
as
ordinary
guilt
acutely
sensitive
to
pain
and
fear
she
had
both
known
the
better
to
what
terror
might
prompt
the
injured
and
was
the
more
appalled
by
the
prospect
her
eagerness
to
accept
by
anticipation
whatever
degradation
and
pain
domestic
power
could
inflict
when
released
by
the
terrible
alternative
of
legal
prosecution
from
its
usual
limits
breathed
more
of
doubt
and
terror
than
of
shame
or
penitence
but
at
first
it
keenly
affected
me
it
was
with
something
akin
to
a
bodily
pang
that
i
heard
this
fragile
girl
so
easily
subdued
by
such
rebuke
or
menace
as
her
companions
would
scarcely
have
affected
to
fear
now
pleading
for
punishment
such
as
would
have
quelled
the
pride
and
courage
of
the
most
of
her
sex
i
felt
the
deepest
pity
not
so
much
for
the
fear
with
which
she
still
trembled
as
for
the
agony
of
terror
she
must
have
previously
endured
eveena
averted
from
her
abject
supplications
a
face
in
which
i
read
much
pain
but
more
of
what
would
have
been
disgust
in
a
less
intensely
sympathetic
nature
and
ere
long
i
saw
or
felt
in
manner
that
which
caused
me
suddenly
to
dismiss
eveena
from
the
room
as
from
a
presence
unfit
for
her
spotless
purity
and
exquisite
delicacy
finding
in
me
no
sign
of
passionate
anger
no
readiness
but
reluctance
to
visit
treason
with
physical
pain
eivé
own
expression
changed
unable
to
conceive
the
feeling
that
rendered
the
course
she
had
at
first
expected
simply
impossible
to
me
a
nature
i
had
utterly
misconceived
caught
at
an
idea
few
women
not
experienced
in
the
worst
of
life
lessons
would
have
entertained
the
tiny
fragile
form
the
slight
limbs
whose
delicate
proportions
seemed
to
me
almost
those
of
infancy
their
irrepressible
quivering
plainly
revealed
by
the
absence
of
robe
and
veil
no
man
worthy
of
the
name
could
have
beheld
without
intense
compassion
but
such
a
feeling
she
could
not
realise
as
her
features
lost
the
sincerity
of
overwhelming
fear
as
the
drooping
lids
failed
for
one
moment
to
conceal
a
look
of
almost
assured
exultation
in
the
dark
eyes
my
soul
was
suddenly
and
thoroughly
revolted
i
had
forgiven
the
hand
aimed
at
a
heart
that
never
throbbed
with
a
pulse
unkind
to
her
i
might
have
forgotten
the
treason
that
requited
tenderness
and
trust
by
seeking
my
life
but
i
could
never
forget
never
recover
that
moment
insight
into
thoughts
that
so
outraged
an
affection
which
if
my
conscience
belied
me
not
was
absolutely
stainless
and
unselfish
it
cost
a
strong
persistent
effort
of
to
address
her
again
but
a
confession
full
and
complete
my
duty
to
others
compelled
me
to
enforce
the
story
of
the
next
hour
i
never
told
or
can
tell
to
one
only
did
i
give
a
confidence
that
would
have
rendered
explanation
natural
and
that
one
was
the
last
to
whom
i
could
have
spoken
on
this
subject
enough
that
the
charming
infantine
simplicity
had
disguised
an
elaborate
treachery
of
which
i
reluctantly
learned
that
human
nature
is
capable
the
caressed
and
caressing
child
had
sold
my
life
if
not
her
own
soul
for
the
promise
of
wealth
that
could
purchase
nothing
i
denied
her
and
of
the
first
place
among
the
women
of
her
world
that
promise
i
soon
found
had
not
been
warranted
directly
or
indirectly
by
him
who
alone
could
at
present
fulfil
it
needless
to
relate
the
details
either
of
the
confession
or
its
extortion
enough
that
eivé
learnt
at
last
perforce
that
though
i
had
as
it
seemed
to
her
been
fool
enough
to
spare
her
the
vengeance
of
the
law
and
to
spare
her
still
as
far
as
possible
her
power
to
fool
me
further
was
gone
for
ever
needless
to
speak
of
the
lies
repeated
and
sustained
till
truth
was
wrung
from
quivering
lips
and
sobbing
voice
of
the
looks
that
appealed
long
and
incredulously
to
a
love
as
utterly
forfeited
as
misunderstood
to
the
last
eivé
could
not
comprehend
the
nature
that
having
spared
her
so
much
would
not
spare
wholly
the
mercy
felt
for
the
weakness
not
for
the
charms
of
youth
and
sex
shamed
grieved
wounded
to
the
quick
i
quitted
the
presence
of
one
who
i
fear
was
as
little
worth
the
anguish
i
then
endured
for
her
as
the
tenderness
she
had
so
long
betrayed
and
left
the
late
darling
of
my
house
a
prisoner
under
strict
guard
necessary
for
the
safety
of
others
than
ourselves
finding
a
message
awaiting
me
i
sought
at
once
the
interview
which
the
sovereign
fearlessly
granted
i
see
said
the
prince
with
much
feeling
as
he
received
my
salute
that
you
have
gone
through
deeper
pain
than
such
domestic
losses
can
well
cause
to
us
i
am
sorry
that
you
are
grieved
i
can
say
no
more
and
perhaps
the
less
i
say
the
less
pain
i
shall
give
only
permit
me
this
remark
since
i
have
known
you
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
the
utter
distinction
between
our
character
and
yours
showing
as
it
does
at
so
many
points
springs
from
some
single
we
so
careful
of
our
own
life
and
comfort
care
little
for
those
of
others
we
so
afraid
of
pain
are
indifferent
to
its
infliction
unless
we
have
to
witness
it
and
only
some
of
us
flinch
from
the
sight
the
softness
of
heart
you
show
in
this
trouble
seems
in
some
strange
way
associated
with
the
strength
of
heart
which
you
have
proved
in
dangers
the
least
of
which
none
of
us
would
have
encountered
willingly
and
which
forced
on
us
would
have
unnerved
us
all
i
am
glad
to
prove
to
you
that
to
some
extent
i
depart
from
my
national
character
and
approach
however
distantly
to
yours
i
can
feel
for
a
friend
sorrow
and
i
can
face
what
you
seem
to
consider
a
real
danger
but
you
had
a
purpose
in
asking
this
audience
my
ears
are
open
your
lips
are
unsealed
prince
i
replied
what
you
have
said
opens
the
way
to
that
i
wished
to
ask
you
say
truly
that
courage
and
tenderness
have
a
common
root
as
have
the
unmanly
softness
and
equally
unmanly
hardness
common
among
your
subjects
those
for
whom
death
ends
all
utterly
and
for
ever
will
of
necessity
at
least
as
soon
as
the
training
of
years
and
of
generations
has
rendered
their
thought
consistent
dread
death
with
intensest
fear
and
love
to
brighten
and
sweeten
life
with
every
possible
enjoyment
animal
enjoyment
becomes
the
most
precious
since
it
is
the
keenest
higher
pleasures
lose
half
their
value
when
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
reduced
to
the
distinction
between
the
sensations
of
higher
and
lower
nerve
centres
thus
men
care
too
much
for
themselves
to
care
for
others
and
after
all
strong
deep
affection
entwined
with
the
heartstrings
can
only
torture
and
tear
the
hearts
for
which
death
is
a
final
parting
such
love
as
i
have
felt
for
woman
even
such
love
as
i
felt
for
her
your
gift
whom
i
have
lost
would
be
pain
intolerable
if
the
thought
were
ever
present
that
one
day
we
must
and
any
day
we
might
part
for
ever
i
put
the
knife
against
my
breast
my
life
in
your
hand
when
i
say
this
and
i
ask
of
you
no
secrecy
no
favour
for
myself
but
that
as
i
trust
you
you
will
guard
the
life
that
is
dearest
to
me
if
you
take
from
me
the
power
to
guard
it
there
are
those
among
your
subjects
who
are
not
the
cowards
you
find
around
your
throne
who
are
not
brutal
in
their
households
not
incapable
of
tenderness
and
sacrifice
for
others
as
i
spoke
i
carefully
watched
the
prince
face
on
which
no
shade
of
displeasure
was
visible
rather
the
sentiment
of
one
who
is
somewhat
gratified
to
hear
a
perplexing
problem
solved
in
a
manner
agreeable
to
his
wishes
and
the
reason
is
i
continued
that
these
men
and
women
believe
or
know
that
they
are
answerable
to
an
eternal
sovereign
mightier
than
yourself
and
that
they
will
reap
not
perhaps
here
but
after
death
as
they
shall
have
sown
that
if
they
do
not
forfeit
the
promise
by
their
own
deed
they
shall
rejoin
hereafter
those
dearest
to
them
here
there
are
such
he
said
i
would
they
were
known
to
me
i
had
not
dreamed
that
there
were
in
my
realm
men
who
would
screen
the
heart
of
another
with
their
own
palm
prince
i
replied
earnestly
i
as
their
ambassador
as
one
of
their
leaders
appeal
to
you
to
know
and
to
protect
them
they
can
defend
themselves
at
need
and
it
may
be
might
prevail
though
matched
one
against
a
thousand
for
their
weapons
are
those
against
which
no
distance
no
defences
no
numbers
afford
protection
but
in
such
a
strife
many
of
their
lives
must
be
lost
and
infinite
suffering
and
havoc
wrought
on
foes
they
would
willingly
spare
they
are
threatened
with
extermination
by
secret
spite
or
open
force
but
open
force
will
be
the
last
resort
of
enemies
well
aware
that
those
who
strike
at
the
star
have
ever
been
smitten
by
the
lightning
a
slight
change
in
his
countenance
satisfied
me
that
the
emblem
was
not
unknown
to
him
you
say
he
replied
that
there
is
an
organised
scheme
to
destroy
these
people
by
force
or
fraud
the
scheme
prince
was
confessed
in
my
own
hearing
by
one
of
its
instruments
and
in
proof
thereof
my
own
life
as
a
chief
of
the
order
was
attempted
this
morning
the
prince
sprang
to
his
feet
in
all
the
passion
of
a
man
who
for
the
first
time
receives
a
personal
insult
of
an
autocrat
stung
to
the
quick
by
an
unprecedented
outrage
to
his
authority
and
dignity
who
has
dared
he
said
who
has
taken
on
himself
to
make
law
or
form
plans
for
carrying
out
old
law
without
my
leave
who
has
dared
to
strike
at
the
life
over
which
i
have
cast
the
shadow
of
my
throne
give
me
their
names
my
guest
and
before
the
evening
mist
closes
in
pronounce
their
doom
i
can
not
obey
your
royal
command
i
have
no
proof
against
the
only
man
who
to
my
knowledge
can
desire
my
death
those
who
actually
and
immediately
aimed
at
my
life
are
shielded
by
the
inviolable
weakness
of
sex
from
the
revenge
and
even
the
justice
of
manhood
each
man
returned
the
prince
but
partially
conceiving
my
meaning
is
master
at
home
i
wish
i
were
satisfied
that
your
heart
will
let
you
deal
justly
and
wisely
with
the
most
hateful
offspring
of
the
most
hateful
of
living
races
a
woman
who
betrays
the
life
of
her
lord
but
those
who
planned
a
general
scheme
of
destruction
a
purpose
of
public
policy
without
my
knowledge
must
aim
also
at
my
life
and
throne
for
even
were
their
purpose
such
as
i
approved
attempted
without
my
permission
they
know
i
would
never
pardon
the
presumption
i
do
not
sit
in
council
with
dull
ears
or
silent
lips
or
empty
hands
and
it
is
not
for
the
highest
more
than
for
the
lowest
under
me
to
snatch
my
sceptre
for
a
moment
guard
then
your
own
i
said
without
your
leave
and
in
your
lifetime
open
force
will
scarcely
he
used
against
us
and
if
against
secret
murder
or
outrage
we
appeal
to
the
law
you
will
see
that
the
law
does
justice
i
will
he
replied
and
i
pardon
your
advice
to
guard
my
own
because
you
judge
me
by
my
people
but
a
prince
life
is
the
charge
of
his
guards
the
lives
of
his
people
are
his
care
he
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
evidently
in
deep
reflection
i
thank
you
he
said
at
last
and
i
give
you
one
warning
in
partial
return
for
yours
there
is
a
law
which
can
be
used
against
the
members
of
a
secret
society
with
terrible
effect
not
only
are
they
exposed
to
death
if
detected
but
those
who
strike
them
are
legally
exempt
from
punishment
i
will
care
that
that
law
shall
not
menace
you
long
whilst
it
remains
guard
yourselves
i
am
powerless
to
break
it
as
i
quitted
the
palace
ergimo
joined
me
and
mounted
my
carriage
seizing
a
moment
when
none
were
within
sight
or
hearing
he
said
astona
was
found
two
hours
ago
dead
as
an
enemy
or
a
traitor
dies
she
was
seen
to
fall
from
the
roof
of
her
house
and
none
was
near
her
when
she
fell
but
davilo
has
already
been
arrested
as
her
murderer
on
the
ground
that
he
was
heard
before
sunrise
this
morning
to
say
that
she
must
die
who
heard
that
must
have
heard
more
let
this
news
be
quickly
known
to
whom
it
concerns
i
checked
the
carriage
instantly
and
turned
into
a
road
that
conducted
us
in
ten
minutes
to
a
public
telegraph
office
come
with
me
i
said
quickly
as
an
officer
of
the
camptâ
your
presence
may
ensure
the
delivery
of
letters
which
might
otherwise
be
stopped
he
seized
the
hint
at
once
and
as
we
approached
a
vacant
desk
he
said
to
the
nearest
officer
in
the
camptâ
name
a
form
which
ensured
that
the
most
audacious
and
curious
spy
backed
by
the
highest
authority
save
that
invoked
dared
neither
stop
nor
search
into
a
message
so
warranted
before
i
left
the
desk
every
chief
of
the
zinta
at
his
several
post
had
received
through
that
strange
symbolic
language
of
which
i
have
already
given
samples
from
me
advice
of
what
had
occurred
and
from
esmo
warning
to
meet
at
an
appointed
place
and
time
the
day
at
whose
close
we
should
meet
was
that
of
davilo
trial
i
mingled
with
the
crowd
around
the
court
doors
a
crowd
manifesting
bitter
hostility
to
the
prisoner
and
to
the
order
of
whose
secrets
a
revelation
was
eagerly
expected
easily
forcing
my
way
through
the
mass
i
felt
on
a
sudden
a
touch
a
sign
and
turning
my
eyes
saw
a
face
i
had
surely
never
looked
on
before
yet
the
sign
could
only
have
been
given
by
a
colleague
that
which
followed
implied
the
presence
of
the
signet
itself
i
told
you
whispered
a
voice
i
knew
well
how
completely
we
can
change
even
countenance
at
will
it
was
so
but
though
acquainted
with
the
process
i
had
never
believed
that
the
change
could
be
so
absolute
by
help
of
my
strength
and
height
still
more
perhaps
by
the
subtle
influence
of
his
own
powerful
will
acting
none
the
less
imperiously
on
minds
unconscious
of
its
influence
esmo
made
his
way
with
me
into
the
court
around
five
sides
of
the
hexagon
were
seats
tier
above
tier
appropriated
to
the
public
who
wish
to
see
as
well
as
hear
the
phonograph
reported
every
word
uttered
to
hundreds
of
distant
offices
against
the
sixth
side
were
placed
the
seats
of
the
seven
judges
in
front
at
an
equal
elevation
the
chair
of
the
prisoner
the
seats
of
the
advocates
on
right
and
left
and
the
place
from
which
each
witness
must
deliver
his
testimony
in
full
view
and
within
easy
hearing
both
of
the
bench
the
bar
and
the
audience
davilo
sat
in
his
chair
unguarded
but
in
an
attitude
strangely
constrained
and
motionless
only
his
bright
eyes
moved
freely
and
his
head
turned
a
little
from
side
to
side
he
recognised
us
instantly
and
his
look
expressed
no
trace
of
fear
the
whispered
esmo
observing
my
perplexity
it
paralyses
the
nerves
of
motion
leaving
those
of
sensation
active
and
is
administered
to
a
prisoner
on
the
instant
of
his
arrest
so
as
to
keep
him
absolutely
helpless
till
his
sentence
is
executed
or
till
on
his
acquittal
an
antidote
is
administered
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
stated
in
the
briefest
possible
words
the
story
of
astona
from
the
moment
when
she
left
my
house
to
that
at
which
she
was
found
dead
and
the
method
of
her
death
related
davilo
words
and
then
proceeded
to
call
his
witnesses
of
course
the
one
vital
question
was
whether
by
possibility
davilo
who
had
never
left
my
premises
since
the
words
were
uttered
could
have
brought
about
a
death
evidently
accidental
in
its
immediate
cause
at
a
distance
of
many
miles
his
words
were
attested
by
one
whom
i
recognised
as
an
officer
of
endo
zamptâ
and
i
was
called
to
confirm
or
contradict
them
the
presiding
judge
as
i
took
my
place
read
a
brief
telling
terrible
menace
expounding
the
legal
penalties
of
perjury
you
will
speak
the
truth
he
said
or
you
know
the
consequences
as
he
spoke
he
encountered
esmo
eyes
and
quailed
under
the
gaze
sinking
back
into
his
seat
motionless
as
the
bird
under
the
alleged
fascination
of
the
serpent
i
admitted
that
the
words
in
question
had
been
addressed
to
me
and
i
proved
that
davilo
had
been
busily
engaged
with
me
from
that
moment
until
an
hour
later
than
that
of
the
fatal
accident
there
being
thus
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts
a
keen
contest
of
argument
proceeded
between
the
advocates
on
either
side
the
defenders
of
the
prisoner
ridiculed
with
an
affectation
of
scientific
contempt
none
the
less
effective
because
the
chief
pleader
was
himself
an
experienced
member
of
our
order
the
idea
that
the
actions
or
fate
of
a
person
at
a
distance
could
be
affected
by
the
mere
will
of
another
and
related
as
absurd
and
incredible
traditions
of
old
to
this
purport
some
anecdotes
which
had
been
communicated
to
me
as
among
the
best
attested
and
most
striking
examples
of
the
historical
exercise
of
the
mystic
powers
the
able
and
bigoted
sceptics
who
prosecuted
this
day
in
the
interests
of
science
insisted
with
equal
inconsistency
and
equal
skill
on
the
innumerable
recorded
and
attested
instances
of
some
diabolical
power
possessed
by
certain
supposed
members
of
a
detested
and
malignant
sect
a
year
ago
the
judges
would
probably
have
sided
unanimously
with
the
former
but
the
feeling
that
animated
the
conspiracy
if
it
should
be
so
called
against
the
zinta
had
penetrated
all
martial
society
and
in
order
to
destroy
the
votaries
of
religion
science
in
the
persons
of
her
most
distinguished
students
was
this
day
ready
to
abjure
her
character
and
forswear
her
most
cherished
tenets
as
has
often
happened
in
mars
and
may
one
day
happen
on
earth
as
the
new
ideas
come
into
greater
force
proven
fact
was
deliberately
set
against
logical
impossibility
and
for
once
what
probably
had
not
happened
in
mars
for
ten
thousand
years
proven
fact
and
common
sense
carried
the
day
against
science
and
universal
experience
but
unhappily
against
the
prisoner
after
retiring
separately
for
about
an
hour
the
judges
returned
their
brief
and
very
confused
decisions
were
read
by
the
secretary
the
reasons
were
seldom
intelligible
each
contradicting
himself
and
all
his
colleagues
and
not
one
among
the
judgments
having
even
the
appearance
of
cohesion
and
consistency
but
by
six
to
one
they
doomed
the
prisoner
to
the
as
he
was
carried
forth
his
eyes
met
ours
and
the
perfect
calm
and
steadiness
of
their
glance
astounded
me
not
a
little
my
natural
thought
prompted
of
course
an
appeal
to
the
mercy
of
the
throne
in
every
state
a
power
of
giving
effect
in
the
law
despite
to
public
policy
or
of
commanding
that
in
certain
strange
and
unforeseen
circumstances
common
sense
and
practical
justice
shall
override
a
sentence
which
no
court
bound
by
the
letter
of
the
law
can
withhold
must
rest
with
the
sovereign
but
in
mars
the
prerogative
of
mercy
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
judicial
rather
than
political
mercy
is
exercised
less
by
the
prince
himself
than
by
a
small
council
of
judges
advising
him
and
pronouncing
their
decision
in
his
name
even
if
we
could
have
relied
on
the
camptâ
with
absolute
confidence
there
were
many
reasons
against
an
appeal
which
would
in
fact
have
asked
him
to
declare
himself
on
our
side
while
such
a
declaration
might
in
the
existing
state
of
public
feeling
have
caused
revolt
or
riot
it
would
have
put
on
their
guard
perhaps
driven
to
a
premature
attempt
which
he
was
not
prepared
to
meet
the
traitors
whose
scheme
against
his
life
the
prince
felt
confident
that
he
should
speedily
detect
and
punish
all
these
considerations
were
brought
before
our
council
whose
debate
was
brief
but
not
hurried
or
excited
the
supreme
calm
of
demeanour
communicated
itself
to
all
the
eleven
in
not
one
of
whom
could
i
recognise
till
they
spoke
my
colleagues
of
our
last
council
the
order
went
forth
that
a
party
should
attend
esmo
orders
at
a
point
about
half
a
mile
distant
from
the
studio
in
which
for
the
benefit
of
a
great
medical
school
my
unhappy
friend
was
to
be
put
to
torture
indescribable
happily
said
esmo
the
first
portion
of
the
experiment
will
be
made
by
the
alone
and
will
commence
at
midnight
half
an
hour
before
that
time
our
party
will
be
assembled
i
had
insisted
on
being
one
of
the
band
and
esmo
had
very
reluctantly
yielded
to
the
unanimous
approval
of
colleagues
who
thought
that
on
this
occasion
physical
strength
might
render
essential
service
at
some
unforeseen
crisis
moreover
the
place
lying
within
my
geographical
province
several
of
those
engaged
looked
up
to
me
as
their
immediate
chief
and
it
was
thought
well
to
place
me
on
such
an
occasion
at
their
head
the
night
was
as
had
been
predicted
absolutely
dark
but
the
roads
were
brilliantly
lighted
suddenly
however
as
we
drew
towards
the
point
of
meeting
the
lights
went
out
an
accident
unprecedented
in
martial
administration
but
they
will
be
relighted
said
one
of
my
companions
can
human
skill
relight
the
lamps
that
the
power
of
the
star
has
extinguished
was
the
reply
of
another
we
fell
in
military
order
with
perfect
discipline
and
steadiness
under
the
influence
of
esmo
silent
will
and
scarcely
discernible
gestures
the
wing
of
the
college
in
which
the
dissection
was
to
take
place
was
guarded
by
some
forty
sentinels
armed
with
the
spear
and
lightning
gun
but
as
we
came
close
to
them
i
observed
that
each
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
with
eyes
open
but
utterly
devoid
of
sight
i
have
been
here
before
you
murmured
esmo
to
the
left
the
door
gave
way
at
once
before
the
touch
of
some
electric
instrument
or
immaterial
power
wielded
by
his
hand
we
passed
in
guided
by
him
through
one
or
two
chambers
and
along
a
passage
at
the
end
of
which
a
light
shone
through
a
crystal
door
here
proof
of
esmo
superior
judgment
was
afforded
he
would
fain
have
had
the
party
much
smaller
than
it
was
and
composed
exclusively
of
the
very
few
old
and
experienced
members
of
the
zinta
within
reach
at
the
moment
we
were
nearly
a
score
in
number
some
even
more
inexperienced
than
myself
half
the
party
my
own
immediate
followers
and
i
remembered
far
better
the
feelings
of
a
friend
and
a
soldier
than
the
lessons
of
the
college
or
the
shrine
as
the
door
opened
and
we
caught
sight
of
our
friend
stretched
on
the
vivisection
table
the
younger
of
the
company
hurried
on
by
my
own
example
lost
their
heads
and
got
so
to
speak
out
of
hand
we
rushed
tumultuously
forward
and
fell
on
the
vivisector
and
two
assistants
who
stood
motionless
and
perhaps
unconscious
but
with
glittering
knives
just
ready
for
their
fiendish
work
before
esmo
could
interpose
these
executioners
were
cut
down
with
the
crimson
blade
cold
steel
and
we
bore
off
our
friend
with
more
of
eagerness
and
triumph
than
at
all
befitted
our
own
consciousness
of
power
or
suited
the
temper
of
our
chief
never
did
esmo
speak
so
sharply
or
severely
as
in
the
brief
reprimand
he
gave
us
when
we
reassembled
the
justice
of
which
i
instinctively
acknowledged
as
he
ceased
by
the
salute
i
had
given
so
often
at
the
close
of
less
impressive
and
less
richly
deserved
reprimands
on
the
parade

or
the
march

and
speedily
relieved
from
the
effects
of
the

carried
off
to
a
place
of
temporary
concealment
and
we
dispersed
eveena
heard
my
story
with
more
annoyance
than
interest
mortified
not
a
little
by
the
reproof
i
had
drawn
upon
myself
and
my
followers
and
despite
her
reluctance
to
seem
to
acknowledge
a
fault
in
me
apparently
afraid
that
a
similar
ebullition
of
feeling
might
on
some
future
occasion
lead
to
serious
disaster
chapter

azrael
to
detain
as
a
captive
and
a
culprit
thus
converting
my
own
house
into
a
prison
my
murderess
and
former
plaything
was
intolerably
painful
to
leave
her
at
large
was
to
incur
danger
such
as
i
had
no
right
to
bring
on
others
to
dismiss
her
was
less
perilous
than
the
one
course
less
painful
than
the
other
but
combined
peril
and
pain
in
a
degree
which
rendered
both
eveena
and
myself
most
reluctant
to
adopt
it
from
words
of
esmo
and
from
other
sources
i
gathered
that
the
usual
course
under
such
circumstances
would
have
been
to
keep
the
culprit
under
no
other
restraint
than
that
confinement
to
the
house
which
is
too
common
to
be
remarkable
trusting
to
the
terror
which
punishment
inflicted
and
menaced
by
domestic
authority
would
inspire
but
eivé
now
understood
the
limits
which
conscience
or
feeling
imposed
on
the
use
of
an
otherwise
unlimited
power
she
knew
very
nearly
how
much
she
could
have
to
fear
and
timid
as
she
was
would
not
be
cowed
or
controlled
by
apprehensions
so
defined
and
bounded
eveena
herself
naturally
resented
the
peril
and
was
revolted
by
the
treason
even
more
intensely
than
myself
and
was
for
once
hardly
content
that
so
heinous
a
crime
should
be
so
lightly
visited
in
interposing
between
the
culprit
and
the
horrors
of
the
law
she
had
taken
for
granted
the
strenuous
exertion
of
a
domestic
jurisdiction
almost
as
absolute
under
the
circumstances
as
that
of
ancient
rome
what
suggested
to
you
i
asked
one
day
of
eveena
the
suspicion
that
so
narrowly
saved
my
life
the
carefully
steadied
hand
you
have
teased
her
so
often
for
spilling
everything
it
carried
and
the
unsteady
eyes
but
she
added
reluctantly
i
never
liked
to
watch
her
no
not
lest
you
should
notice
it
but
because
she
did
not
seem
true
in
her
ways
with
you
and
i
should
have
missed
those
signs
but
for
a
strange
warning
she
paused
would
not
be
warned
i
answered
with
a
bitter
sigh
tell
me
madonna
it
was
when
you
left
me
in
this
room
alone
she
said
her
exquisite
delicacy
rendering
her
averse
to
recal
not
the
coercion
she
had
suffered
but
the
pain
she
knew
i
felt
in
so
coercing
her
dearest
she
added
with
a
sudden
effort
let
me
speak
frankly
and
dispel
the
pain
you
feel
while
you
think
over
it
in
silence
i
kissed
the
hand
that
clasped
my
own
and
she
went
on
speaking
with
intentional
levity
had
a
chief
forgotten
tracing
the
outline
of
a
star
upon
her
bosom
or
did
you
think
clavelta
daughter
had
no
share
in
the
hereditary
gifts
of
her
family
but
how
did
you
unlock
the
springs
ah
those
might
have
baffled
me
if
you
had
trusted
to
them
you
made
a
double
mistake
when
you
left
enva
on
guard
you
do
think
i
tempted
her
to
disobey
eager
as
i
was
for
release
i
could
not
have
been
so
doubly
false
she
did
it
unconsciously
it
is
time
to
put
her
out
of
pain
does
she
know
me
so
little
as
to
think
i
could
mean
to
torture
her
by
suspense
besides
even
she
must
have
seen
that
you
had
secured
her
pardon
or
my
own
punishment
eveena
answered
spare
me
such
words
eveena
unless
you
mean
to
make
me
yet
more
ashamed
of
the
compulsion
i
did
employ
i
never
spoke
i
never
thought
forgive
me
dearest
will
it
vex
you
to
find
how
clearly
your
has
learned
to
read
your
will
through
your
eyes
when
i
refused
to
obey
and
you
felt
yourself
obliged
to
compel
your
first
momentary
thought
was
to
threaten
your
next
that
i
should
not
believe
you
when
you
laid
your
hand
upon
my
shoulder
thus
it
was
no
gesture
of
anger
or
menace
you
thought
of
the
only
promise
i
must
believe
and
you
dropped
the
thought
as
quickly
as
your
hand
you
would
not
speak
the
word
you
might
have
to
keep
nay
dearest
what
pains
you
so
you
gave
me
no
pain
even
when
you
called
another
to
enforce
your
command
yet
surely
you
know
that
must
have
tried
my
spirit
far
more
than
anything
else
you
could
do
you
did
well
do
you
think
that
i
did
not
appreciate
your
imperious
anxiety
for
me
that
i
did
not
respect
your
resolution
to
do
what
you
thought
right
or
feel
how
much
it
cost
you
if
anything
in
the
ways
of
love
like
yours
could
pain
me
it
would
be
the
sort
of
reserved
tenderness
that
never
treats
me
as
frankly
and
simply
as
there
was
no
need
to
name
either
of
those
so
dearly
loved
so
lately
and
alas
so
differently
lost
trusting
the
loyalty
of
my
love
so
absolutely
in
all
else
can
you
not
trust
it
to
accept
willingly
the
enforcement
of
your
will
as
you
have
enforced
it
on
all
others
you
have
ruled
from
the
soldiers
of
your
own
world
to
the
rest
of
your
household
ah
the
light
breaks
through
the
mist
before
you
gave
enva
her
charge
you
said
to
me
in
her
presence
me
what
you
force
upon
me
as
if
i
above
all
were
not
your
own
to
deal
with
as
you
will
dearest
do
you
so
wrong
her
who
loves
you
and
is
honoured
by
your
love
as
to
fancy
that
any
exertion
of
your
authority
could
make
her
feel
humbled
in
your
eyes
or
her
own
it
was
impossible
to
answer
nothing
would
have
more
deeply
wounded
her
simple
humility
so
free
from
as
the
plain
truth
that
as
her
character
unfolded
the
infinite
superiority
of
her
nature
almost
awed
me
as
something
save
for
the
intense
and
occasionally
passionate
tenderness
of
her
love
less
like
a
woman
than
an
angel
i
was
absorbed
she
continued
in
the
effort
that
had
thrown
enva
into
the
slumber
of
obedience
i
did
not
know
or
feel
where
i
was
or
what
i
had
next
to
do
my
thought
still
concentrated
had
forgotten
its
accomplished
purpose
and
was
bent
on
your
danger
somehow
on
the
cushioned
pile
i
seemed
to
see
a
figure
strange
to
me
but
which
i
shall
never
forget
it
was
a
young
girl
very
slight
pale
sickly
with
dark
circles
round
the
closed
eyes
slumbering
like
enva
but
in
everything
else
enva
very
opposite
i
suppose
i
was
myself
entranced
or
dreaming
conscious
only
of
my
anxiety
for
you
so
that
it
seemed
natural
that
everything
should
concern
you
i
remember
nothing
of
my
dream
but
the
words
which
when
i
came
to
myself
in
the
peristyle
alone
were
as
clear
in
my
memory
as
they
are
now
the
hand
and
read
the
eyes
on
his
breast
the
danger
lies
strength
is
weak
and
childhood
wise
the
bowl
and
the
knife
rests
on
him
the
sovereign
life
rests
the
husband
on
the
wife
that
would
his
power
command
know
who
holds
his
heart
in
hand
silken
tress
is
surest
band
they
judge
kargynda
mood
steel
to
peril
pain
and
blood
surely
through
his
mate
subdued
can
make
the
strong
a
slave
fool
the
wise
and
quell
the
brave
love
by
sacrifice
can
save
she
again
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
you
hear
murmured
eveena
in
kindness
to
me
heed
my
warning
if
you
have
neglected
all
others
do
not
break
my
heart
in
your
mercy
to
another
eivé
the
prophetess
knows
me
better
than
you
do
the
warning
means
that
they
now
desire
my
secret
before
my
life
and
scheme
to
make
your
safety
the
price
of
my
dishonour
it
is
the
thought
or
the
regent
as
i
could
not
decide
to
send
eivé
forth
without
home
protection
or
control
and
eveena
could
suggest
no
other
course
the
days
wore
on
under
a
domestic
which
rendered
the
least
sensitive
among
us
uncomfortable
and
unhappy
and
deprived
three
at
least
of
the
party
of
appetite
of
ease
and
almost
of
sleep
till
two
alarming
incidents
broke
the
painful
stagnation
i
had
just
left
eivé
prison
one
morning
when
eveena
who
was
habitually
entrusted
with
the
charge
of
these
communications
put
into
my
hands
two
slips
of
tafroo
the
one
had
been
given
her
by
an
ambâ
and
came
from
davilo
substitute
on
the
estate
it
said
simply
you
and
you
alone
were
recognised
among
the
rescuers
of
your
friend
before
two
days
have
passed
an
attempt
will
be
made
to
arrest
you
the
other
came
from
esmo
and
eveena
had
brought
it
to
me
unread
as
was
indeed
her
practice
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
her
though
i
held
her
closely
as
i
read
aloud
the
brief
message
which
announced
the
death
by
the
sting
of
two
dragons
evidently
launched
by
some
assassin
hand
but
under
circumstances
that
rendered
detection
by
ordinary
means
hopeless
for
the
moment
of
her
brother
and
son
kevimâ
and
invited
us
to
a
funeral
ceremony
peculiar
to
the
zinta
i
need
not
speak
of
the
painful
minutes
that
followed
during
which
eveena
strove
to
suppress
for
my
sake
at
once
her
tears
for
her
loss
and
her
renewed
and
intensified
terror
on
my
own
account
it
was
suddenly
announced
by
the
usual
signs
of
the
mute
messenger
that
a
visitor
awaited
me
in
the
hall
ergimo
brought
a
message
from
the
camptâ
which
ran
as
follows
aware
that
their
treachery
is
suspected
the
enemy
now
seek
your
secret
first
and
then
your
life
guard
both
for
a
very
short
time
your
fate
your
friends
and
my
own
are
staked
on
the
issue
the
same
council
that
sends
the
traitors
to
the
rack
will
see
the
law
repealed
i
questioned
ergimo
as
to
his
knowledge
of
the
situation
the
enemy
he
said
must
have
changed
their
plan
one
among
them
at
least
is
probably
aware
that
his
treason
is
suspected
both
by
his
sovereign
and
by
the
order
this
will
drive
him
desperate
and
if
he
can
capture
you
and
extort
your
secret
he
will
think
he
can
use
it
to
effect
his
purpose
or
at
least
to
ensure
his
escape
he
may
think
open
rebellion
desperate
as
it
is
safer
than
waiting
for
the
first
blow
to
come
from
the
zinta
or
from
the
palace
my
resolve
was
speedily
taken
at
the
same
moment
came
the
necessity
for
escape
and
the
opportunity
and
excuse
i
sought
out
the
writer
of
the
first
message
who
entirely
concurred
with
me
in
the
propriety
of
the
step
i
was
about
to
take
only
recommending
me
to
apply
personally
for
a
passport
from
the
camptâ
such
as
would
override
any
attempt
to
detain
me
even
by
legal
warrant
he
undertook
to
care
for
those
i
left
behind
to
release
and
provide
for
eivé
and
to
see
in
case
i
should
not
return
that
full
justice
was
done
to
the
interests
of
the
others
as
well
as
to
their
claim
to
release
from
contracts
which
my
departure
from
their
world
ought
like
death
itself
to
cancel
the
royal
passport
came
ere
i
was
ready
to
depart
expressed
in
the
fullest
clearest
language
and
such
as
none
but
an
officer
prepared
instantly
to
rebel
against
the
authority
which
gave
it
dared
defy
during
the
last
preparations
velna
and
eveena
were
closeted
together
in
the
chamber
of
the
former
nor
did
i
care
to
interrupt
a
parting
the
most
painful
save
one
of
those
that
had
this
day
to
be
undergone
i
went
myself
to
eivé
i
leave
you
i
said
a
prisoner
not
i
hope
for
long
if
i
return
in
safety
i
will
then
consider
in
what
manner
the
termination
of
your
confinement
can
be
reconciled
with
what
is
due
to
myself
and
others
if
not
you
will
be
yet
more
certainly
and
more
speedily
released
and
now
child
whom
i
once
loved
to
whom
i
thought
i
had
been
especially
gentle
and
indulgent
was
the
miserable
reward
offered
you
the
sole
motive
that
raised
your
hand
against
my
life
poison
i
have
always
said
is
the
protection
of
the
household
slave
against
the
domestic
tyrant
if
i
had
ever
been
harsh
or
unjust
to
you
if
i
had
made
your
life
unhappy
by
caprice
or
by
severity
i
could
understand
but
you
of
all
have
had
least
reason
to
complain
not
enva
jealous
temper
not
leenoo
spite
ever
suggested
to
them
the
idea
which
came
so
easily
and
was
so
long
and
deliberately
cherished
in
your
breast
she
rose
and
faced
me
and
there
was
something
of
contempt
in
the
eyes
that
answered
mine
for
this
once
with
the
old
fearless
frankness
i
had
no
reason
to
hate
you
not
certainly
for
the
kind
of
injury
which
commonly
provokes
women
to
risk
the
lives
their
masters
have
made
intolerable
that
your
discipline
was
the
lightest
ever
known
in
a
household
i
need
not
tell
you
that
it
fell
more
lightly
if
somewhat
oftener
on
me
than
on
others
you
know
as
well
as
i
put
all
the
correction
or
reproof
i
ever
received
from
you
into
one
and
repeat
it
daily
and
never
should
i
have
complained
much
less
dreamed
of
revenge
you
think
enva
or
leenoo
might
less
unnaturally
less
unreasonably
have
turned
upon
you
because
your
measure
to
their
faults
was
somewhat
harder
and
your
heart
colder
to
them
you
did
not
scruple
to
make
a
favourite
of
me
after
a
fashion
as
you
would
never
have
done
even
of
eunané
you
could
pet
and
play
with
me
check
and
punish
me
as
a
child
who
would
not
at
the
sweets
or
be
humbled
by
the
sandal
you
forbore
longer
you
dealt
more
sternly
with
them
because
forsooth
they
were
women
and
i
a
baby
i
who
was
not
less
clever
than
eunané
not
less
capable
of
love
perhaps
of
devotion
to
you
than
eveena
might
rest
my
head
on
your
knee
when
she
was
by
i
might
listen
to
your
talk
when
others
were
sent
away
i
was
too
much
the
child
too
little
the
woman
to
excite
your
distrust
or
her
jealousy
do
you
suppose
i
think
better
of
you
or
feel
the
more
kindly
towards
you
that
you
have
not
taken
vengeance
no
still
you
have
dealt
with
me
as
a
child
so
untaught
yet
by
that
last
lesson
that
even
a
woman
revenge
can
not
make
you
treat
me
as
a
woman
clasfempta
you
bear
i
believe
outside
the
fame
of
a
wise
and
a
firm
man
but
in
these
little
hands
you
have
been
as
weak
a
fool
as
the
veriest
dotard
might
have
been
and
may
be
yet
as
you
will
i
answered
stung
into
an
anger
which
at
any
rate
quelled
the
worst
pain
i
had
felt
when
i
entered
the
room
fool
or
sage
eivé
i
was
your
your
protector
and
your
friend
when
bitter
trouble
befals
you
in
life
or
when
alone
you
find
yourself
face
to
face
with
death
you
may
think
of
what
has
passed
then
remember
for
your
comfort
my
last
words
i
forgive
you
and
i
wish
you
happy
to
velna
i
could
not
speak
sure
that
eveena
had
told
her
all
she
could
wish
to
know
or
all
it
was
safe
to
tell
a
long
embrace
spoke
my
farewell
to
her
who
had
shared
with
me
the
first
part
of
the
long
watch
of
the
enva
and
her
companions
had
gathered
not
from
words
that
this
journey
was
more
than
an
ordinary
absence
some
instinct
or
presentiment
suggested
to
them
that
it
might
possibly
at
least
be
a
final
parting
and
i
was
touched
as
much
as
surprised
by
the
tears
and
broken
words
with
which
they
assured
me
that
greatly
as
they
had
vexed
my
home
life
conscious
as
they
were
that
they
had
contributed
to
it
no
element
but
bitterness
and
trouble
they
felt
that
they
had
been
treated
with
unfailing
justice
and
almost
unfailing
kindness
then
turning
to
eveena
enva
spoke
for
the
rest
we
should
have
treated
you
less
ill
if
we
could
at
all
have
understood
you
we
understand
you
just
as
little
now
clasfempta
is
man
after
all
bridling
his
own
temper
as
a
strong
man
rules
a
large
household
of
women
or
a
herd
of
but
you
are
not
woman
like
other
women
and
yet
in
so
far
as
women
are
or
think
they
are
softer
or
gentler
than
men
so
far
twelvefold
twelve
times
told
are
you
softer
tenderer
gentler
than
woman
eveena
struggled
hard
so
far
to
suppress
her
sobs
as
to
give
an
answer
but
abandoning
the
effort
she
only
kissed
warmly
the
lips
and
clasped
long
and
tenderly
the
hands
that
had
never
spoken
a
kind
word
or
done
a
kind
act
for
her
at
the
very
last
moment
she
faltered
out
a
few
words
which
were
not
for
them
tell
eivé
she
said
i
wish
her
well
and
wishing
her
well
i
can
not
wish
her
happy
we
embarked
in
the
balloon
attended
as
on
our
last
journey
by
two
of
the
brethren
in
my
employment
both
i
noticed
armed
with
the
lightning
gun
i
myself
trusted
as
usual
to
the
sword
strong
straight
heavy
with
two
edges
sharp
as
razors
that
had
enabled
my
hand
so
often
to
guard
my
head
and
the
that
reminded
me
of
so
many
days
of
sport
the
more
enjoyed
for
the
peril
that
attended
it
screened
from
observation
both
reclining
in
our
own
compartment
of
the
car
eveena
and
i
spent
the
long
undisturbed
hours
of
the
first
three
days
and
nights
of
our
journey
in
silent
interchange
of
thought
and
feeling
that
seldom
needed
or
was
interrupted
by
words
her
family
affections
were
very
strong
her
brother
had
deserved
and
won
her
love
but
conscious
so
long
of
a
peril
surrounding
myself
fearfully
impressed
by
the
incident
which
showed
how
close
that
peril
had
come
her
thought
and
feeling
were
absorbed
in
me
so
could
they
have
known
the
present
and
foreseen
the
future
even
those
who
loved
her
best
and
most
prized
her
love
for
them
would
have
wished
it
to
be
as
we
crossed
at
the
height
of
a
thousand
feet
the
river
dividing
that
continent
between
east
and
west
which
marks
the
frontier
of
elcavoo
a
slight
marked
movement
of
agitation
a
few
eager
whispers
of
consultation
in
the
other
compartment
called
my
attention
as
i
parted
the
screen
the
elder
of
the
attendant
brethren
addressed
me
there
is
danger
he
said
in
a
low
tone
not
low
enough
to
escape
eveena
quick
ear
when
my
safety
was
in
question
another
balloon
is
steering
right
across
our
path
and
one
in
it
bears
as
we
see
through
the
the
double
of
mars
the
sash
of
a
regent
while
his
attendants
wear
the
uniform
of
scarlet
and
grey
that
of
endo
zamptâ
take
i
beg
you
this
will
you
take
command
or
shall
we
act
for
you
parting
slightly
the
fold
of
the
mantle
i
wore
for
at
that
height
save
immediately
under
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
atmosphere
is
cold
i
answered
by
showing
the
golden
sash
of
my
rank
we
went
on
steadily
taking
no
note
whatever
of
the
hostile
vessel
till
it
came
within
hailing
distance
keep
your
guns
steadily
pointed
i
said
happen
what
may
if
you
have
to
fire
fire
one
at
any
who
is
ready
to
fire
at
us
the
other
at
the
balloon
itself
a
little
below
but
beside
us
endo
zamptâ
hailed
i
arrest
you
he
said
addressing
me
by
name
on
behalf
of
the
and
by
their
warrant
drop
your
weapons
or
we
fire
and
i
i
said
by
virtue
of
the
camptâ
sign
and
signet
attached
to
this
and
eveena
held
forth
the
paper
while
my
weapon
covered
the
regent
forbid
you
to
interrupt
or
delay
my
voyage
for
a
moment
i
allowed
the
hostile
vessel
to
close
so
nearly
that
endo
could
read
through
his
glass
the
characters
purposely
i
thought
made
unusually
large
of
his
sovereign
peremptory
passport
to
do
so
he
had
dropped
his
weapon
and
his
men
naturally
expecting
a
peaceable
termination
to
the
interview
had
laid
down
theirs
mine
had
obeyed
my
order
and
we
were
masters
of
the
situation
when
with
a
sudden
turn
of
the
screw
throwing
his
vessel
into
an
almost
horizontal
position
endo
brought
his
car
into
collision
with
ours
and
endeavoured
to
seize
eveena
person
as
she
leaned
over
with
the
paper
in
her
hand
she
was
too
quick
for
him
and
i
called
out
at
once
down
or
we
fire
his
men
about
to
grasp
their
pieces
saw
that
one
of
ours
was
levelled
at
the
balloon
and
that
before
they
could
fire
a
single
shot
from
us
must
send
them
earthwards
to
be
crushed
into
one
shapeless
mass
by
the
fall
endo
saw
that
he
had
no
choice
but
to
obey
or
affect
obedience
and
turning
the
tap
that
let
out
the
gas
by
a
pipe
passing
through
the
car
sent
his
vessel
rapidly
downward
as
with
a
formal
salute
he
affected
to
accept
the
command
of
his
prince
instantly
grasping
not
the
lightning
gun
which
if
it
struck
their
balloon
must
destroy
their
whole
party
in
an
instant
but
my
which
by
making
a
small
hole
in
the
vast
surface
would
allow
them
to
descend
alive
though
with
unpleasant
and
perilous
rapidity
i
fired
and
by
so
doing
prevented
the
use
of
an
asphyxiator
concealed
in
the
car
which
the
treacherous
regent
was
rapidly
arranging
for
use
the
success
of
these
manoeuvres
delighted
my
attendants
and
gave
them
a
confidence
they
had
not
yet
felt
in
my
appreciation
of
martial
perils
and
resources
we
reached
ecasfe
and
esmo
house
without
further
molestation
and
a
party
of
the
zinta
watched
the
balloon
while
eveena
and
i
passed
into
the
dwelling
preserved
from
corruption
by
the
cold
which
martial
chemistry
applies
at
pleasure
the
corpse
of
kevimâ
looked
as
the
living
man
looked
in
sleep
but
calmer
and
with
features
more
perfectly
composed
quietly
gravely
with
streaming
tears
but
with
which
dispelled
my
fear
of
evil
consequences
to
her
eveena
kissed
the
lips
that
were
so
soon
to
exist
no
longer
from
the
actual
process
by
which
the
body
is
destroyed
the
taste
and
feeling
of
the
zinta
exclude
the
immediate
relatives
of
the
dead
and
not
till
the
golden
chest
with
its
inscription
was
placed
in
esmo
hands
did
we
take
further
part
in
the
proceeding
then
the
symbolic
confession
of
faith
by
which
the
brethren
attest
and
proclaim
their
confidence
in
the
universal
rule
of
the
giver
of
life
and
in
the
permanence
of
his
gift
was
chanted
a
chief
of
the
order
pronounced
a
brief
but
touching
eulogy
on
the
deceased
another
expressed
on
behalf
of
all
their
sympathy
with
the
bereaved
father
and
family
consigned
to
their
care
the
case
that
contained
all
that
now
remained
to
us
of
the
last
male
heir
of
the
founder
house
was
removed
for
conveyance
to
the
mortuary
chamber
of
the
subterrene
temple
but
ere
those
so
charged
had
turned
to
leave
the
chamber
in
which
the
ceremony
had
passed
a
flash
so
bright
as
at
noonday
to
light
up
the
entire
peristyle
and
the
chambers
opening
on
it
startled
us
all
and
a
sentinel
entering
in
haste
and
consternation
announced
the
destruction
of
our
balloon
by
a
lightning
flash
from
the
weapon
of
some
concealed
enemy
esmo
at
this
alarming
incident
displayed
his
usual
calm
resolve
he
ordered
that
carriages
sufficient
to
convey
some
of
the
brethren
should
be
instantly
collected
and
announced
his
resolve
to
escort
us
at
once
to
the
astronaut
before
five
minutes
had
elapsed
from
the
destruction
of
the
balloon
zulve
and
the
rest
of
the
family
had
taken
leave
of
eveena
and
myself
attended
by
the
party
mustered
occupying
a
carriage
in
the
centre
of
the
procession
we
left
the
gate
of
the
enclosure
i
observed
what
seemed
to
escape
even
esmo
attention
that
angry
looks
were
bent
upon
us
from
many
a
roof
and
that
here
and
there
groups
were
gathered
in
the
enclosures
and
on
the
road
among
whom
i
saw
not
a
few
weapons
i
was
glad
to
remember
that
a
party
of
the
zveltau
still
awaited
esmo
return
at
his
own
residence
we
drove
as
fast
as
the
electric
speed
would
carry
us
along
the
road
i
had
traversed
once
before
in
the
company
of
her
who
was
now
my
wife
to
be
i
hoped
for
the
future
my
sole
wife
and
of
him
who
had
been
ever
since
our
mortal
enemy
where
the
carriages
could
proceed
no
further
we
dismounted
and
esmo
mustered
the
party
in
order
all
were
armed
with
the
spear
and
lightning
gun
placing
eveena
in
the
centre
of
a
solid
square
esmo
directed
me
to
take
my
place
beside
her
i
expostulated
clavelta
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
take
the
place
of
safety
when
others
who
owe
me
nothing
may
be
about
to
risk
life
on
my
behalf
eveena
as
woman
and
as
descendant
of
the
founder
may
well
claim
their
protection
it
is
for
me
to
share
in
her
defence
not
in
her
safety
he
raised
the
arm
that
bore
the
signet
and
looked
at
me
with
the
calm
commanding
glance
that
never
failed
to
enforce
his
will
take
your
place
he
said
and
recalled
to
the
instincts
of
the
camp
i
raised
my
hand
in
the
military
salute
so
long
disused
and
obeyed
in
silence
strike
promptly
strike
hard
and
strike
home
said
esmo
to
his
little
party
the
danger
that
may
threaten
us
is
not
from
the
law
or
from
the
state
but
from
an
attempt
at
murder
through
a
perversion
of
the
law
and
in
the
name
of
the
sovereign
those
who
threaten
us
aim
also
at
the
camptâ
life
and
those
we
may
meet
are
his
foes
as
well
as
ours
conquered
here
they
can
hardly
assail
us
again
victorious
they
will
destroy
us
not
leave
us
an
appeal
to
the
law
or
to
the
throne
placing
himself
a
little
in
front
of
the
troop
our
chief
gave
the
signal
to
advance
and
we
moved
forward
it
seemed
to
me
a
fatal
error
that
no
scout
preceded
us
no
flanking
party
was
thrown
out
this
neglect
reminded
me
that
my
comrades
and
commander
were
devoid
of
military
experience
and
i
was
about
to
remonstrate
when
suddenly
wheeling
on
the
rocky
platform
on
which
i
had
first
paused
in
my
descent
from
the
summit
and
facing
towards
the
latter
we
encountered
a
force
outnumbering
our
own
as
two
to
one
and
wearing
the
colours
of
the
regent
the
front
ranks
quailed
as
men
always
quailed
under
esmo
steady
gaze
and
lost
nerve
and
order
as
they
fell
back
to
right
and
left
a
movement
intended
to
give
play
to
the
asphyxiator
they
had
brought
with
them
their
strategy
was
no
less
ridiculous
than
our
own
devoid
for
ages
of
all
experience
in
conflict
both
leaders
might
have
learned
better
from
the
conduct
of
the
theme
at
bay
the
enemy
were
drawn
up
so
near
the
turn
that
there
was
no
room
for
the
use
of
their
most
destructive
engine
and
had
we
been
better
prepared
neither
this
nor
their
lightning
guns
would
have
been
quick
enough
to
anticipate
a
charge
that
would
have
brought
us
hand
to
hand
even
had
they
been
steady
and
prompt
the
suffocating
shell
would
probably
have
annihilated
both
parties
and
the
discharge
would
certainly
have
been
as
dangerous
to
them
as
to
us
in
another
instant
a
flash
from
several
of
our
weapons
simultaneously
levelled
shattered
the
instrument
to
fragments
we
advanced
at
a
run
and
the
enemy
would
have
given
way
at
once
but
that
their
retreat
lay
up
so
steep
an
incline
and
neither
to
right
nor
left
could
they
well
disperse
being
hemmed
in
by
a
rocky
wall
on
one
side
and
a
precipitous
descent
on
the
other
from
our
right
rear
however
where
the
ground
would
have
concealed
a
numerous
ambush
i
apprehended
an
attack
which
must
have
been
fatal
but
even
so
simple
and
decisive
a
measure
had
never
occurred
to
the
regent
military
ignorance
at
this
critical
moment
a
flash
from
a
thicket
revealed
the
weapon
of
some
hidden
enemy
who
thus
escaped
facing
the
gaze
that
none
could
encounter
and
esmo
fell
struck
dead
at
once
by
the
the
assassin
sprang
up
and
i
recognised
the
features
of
endo
zamptâ
confounded
and
amazed
the
zveltau
broke
and
fell
backward
hurrying
eveena
away
with
them
enabled
by
size
and
strength
to
extricate
myself
at
once
i
stood
at
bay
with
my
back
against
the
rocks
on
our
left
a
projection
rising
as
high
as
my
knee
assisting
to
hinder
the
enemy
from
entirely
and
closely
surrounding
me
i
had
thrown
aside
at
the
moment
of
the
attack
the
mantle
that
concealed
my
sash
and
star
and
i
observed
that
another
chief
had
done
the
same
it
was
he
who
occupying
at
the
trial
the
seat
on
esmo
left
had
shown
the
strongest
disposition
to
mercy
and
now
displayed
the
coolest
courage
amid
confusion
and
danger
rally
them
i
cried
to
him
and
trust
the
crimson
blade
cold
steel
these
hounds
will
never
face
that
the
enemy
had
rushed
forward
as
our
men
fell
back
and
i
was
almost
in
their
midst
thus
protected
to
a
considerable
extent
from
the
lightning
projectile
against
which
alone
i
had
no
defence
hand
to
hand
i
was
a
match
for
more
than
one
or
two
of
my
assailants
though
on
this
occasion
i
wore
no
defensive
armour
and
they
were
clad
in
shirts
of
woven
wire
almost
absolutely
proof
against
the
spear
in
hands
like
theirs
to
die
thus
to
die
for
her
under
her
eyes
leaving
to
her
widowed
life
a
living
token
of
our
love
what
more
could
allah
grant
what
better
could
a
lover
and
a
soldier
desire
there
was
no
honour
and
little
to
satisfy
even
the
passion
of
vengeance
in
the
that
clove
one
enemy
from
the
shoulder
to
the
waist
smote
half
through
the
neck
of
a
second
and
laid
two
or
three
more
dead
or
dying
at
my
feet
if
the
weight
of
the
sword
were
lighter
here
than
on
earth
the
arm
that
wielded
it
had
been
trained
in
very
different
warfare
and
possessed
a
strength
which
made
the
combat
so
unequal
that
had
no
other
life
hung
on
my
blows
i
should
have
been
ashamed
to
strike
as
i
paused
for
a
moment
under
this
feeling
i
noted
that
outside
the
space
half
cleared
by
slaughter
and
by
terror
the
bearers
of
the
lightning
gun
were
forming
a
sort
of
semicircle
embarrassed
by
the
comrades
driven
back
upon
them
but
drawing
momentarily
nearer
and
seeking
to
enclose
before
firing
the
object
of
their
aim
they
would
have
shattered
my
heart
and
head
in
another
instant
but
that
springing
on
the
projecting
stone
of
which
i
have
spoken
which
raised
her
to
my
level
eveena
had
flung
her
arms
around
me
and
sheltered
my
person
with
her
own
this
and
the
confusion
disconcerted
the
aim
of
most
of
the
assailants
the
roar
and
flash
half
stunned
me
for
a
moment
then
as
i
caught
her
in
my
left
arm
i
became
aware
that
it
was
but
her
lifeless
form
that
i
clasped
to
my
breast
giving
her
life
for
mine
she
had
made
mine
worse
than
worthless
my
sword
fell
for
a
moment
from
my
hand
retained
only
by
the
as
i
placed
her
gently
and
tenderly
on
the
ground
resting
against
the
stone
which
had
enabled
her
to
effect
the
sacrifice
i
as
little
desired
as
deserved
then
grasping
my
weapon
again
and
shouting
instinctively
the
of
another
world
i
sprang
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
at
the
same
moment
ân
to
me
the
zinta
cried
the
chief
behind
and
having
rallied
the
broken
ranks
even
before
the
sight
of
eveena
fall
had
inspired
reckless
fury
in
the
place
of
panic
confusion
he
led
on
the
zveltau
the
spear
in
hand
elevated
over
their
heads
and
pointed
at
the
unprotected
faces
of
the
enemy
exposed
to
the
cold
steel
or
its
martial
equivalent
the
latter
as
i
had
predicted
broke
at
once
my
sword
did
its
part
in
the
fray
they
scarcely
fought
neither
did
they
fling
down
their
weapons
but
in
that
moment
neither
force
nor
surrender
would
have
availed
them
we
gave
no
quarter
to
wounded
or
unwounded
foe
when
for
lack
of
objects
i
dropped
the
point
of
my
streaming
sword
i
saw
endo
zamptâ
alive
and
unwounded
in
the
hands
of
the
victors
coward
scoundrel
murderer
i
cried
you
shall
die
a
more
terrible
death
than
that
which
your
own
savage
law
prescribes
for
crimes
like
yours
bind
him
he
shall
hang
from
my
vessel
in
the
air
till
i
see
fit
to
let
him
fall
for
the
rest
see
that
none
are
left
alive
to
boast
what
they
have
done
this
day
struggling
and
screaming
the
regent
was
dragged
to
the
summit
and
hung
by
the
waist
as
i
had
threatened
from
the
entrance
window
of
the
astronaut
esmo
body
and
those
of
the
other
slain
among
the
zveltau
had
been
raised
and
our
comrades
were
about
to
carry
them
to
the
carriages
and
remove
them
homeward
from
the
wardrobe
of
the
astronaut
furnished
anew
for
our
voyage
i
brought
a
long
soft
intended
for
eveena
comfort
and
wrapped
in
it
all
that
was
left
to
us
of
the
loveliest
form
and
the
noblest
heart
that
in
two
worlds
ever
belonged
to
woman
i
shred
one
long
soft
tress
of
mingled
gold
and
brown
from
those
with
which
my
hand
had
played
i
kissed
for
the
last
time
the
lips
that
had
so
often
counselled
pleaded
soothed
and
never
spoken
a
word
that
had
better
been
left
unsaid
then
veiling
face
and
form
in
the
soft
down
i
called
around
me
again
the
brethren
who
had
fallen
back
out
of
sight
of
my
last
farewell
and
gave
the
corpse
into
their
charge
turning
with
restless
eagerness
from
the
agony
which
even
the
sudden
shock
that
rendered
me
half
insensible
could
not
deaden
into
endurable
pain
to
the
passion
of
revenge
i
led
two
or
three
of
our
party
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
beneath
the
entrance
window
of
my
vessel
and
was
about
in
their
presence
to
explain
his
fate
more
fully
to
the
struggling
howling
victim
half
mad
with
protracted
terror
but
at
that
moment
my
purpose
was
arrested
i
had
often
repeated
to
eveena
passages
from
those
terrestrial
works
whose
purport
most
resembled
that
of
the
mystic
lessons
she
so
deeply
prized
and
words
on
which
in
life
she
had
especially
dwelt
seemed
now
to
be
whispered
in
my
ear
or
my
heart
by
the
voice
which
with
bodily
sense
i
could
never
hear
again
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
the
absolute
control
of
my
will
and
conscience
won
by
her
perfect
purity
and
unfailing
rectitude
outlasted
eveena
life
turning
to
her
murderer
you
shall
die
i
said
but
you
shall
die
not
by
revenge
but
by
the
law
and
not
by
your
own
law
but
by
that
which
forbidding
that
torture
shall
add
to
the
sting
of
death
commands
that
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
yet
i
can
not
give
you
a
soldier
death
as
my
men
levelled
their

cutting
the
cord
that
bound
him
and
grasping
him
from
behind
i
flung
the
wretch
forth
from
the
summit
far
into
the
air
well
assured
that
he
would
never
feel
the
blow
that
would
dismiss
his
soul
to
its
last
account
before
that
tribunal
to
whose
judgment
his
victim
had
appealed
then
i
entered
the
vessel
waved
my
hand
in
farewell
to
my
comrades
and
putting
the
machinery
in
action
rose
from
the
surface
and
prepared
to
quit
a
world
which
now
held
nothing
that
could
detain

recal
me
chapter
xxx
farewell
my
task
was
not
quite
done
it
was
well
for
me
in
the
first
moments
of
this
new
solitude
of
this
maddening
agony
that
there
was
instant
work
imperatively
demanding
the
attention
of
the
mind
as
well
as
the
exercise
of
the
body
i
had
first
by
means
of
the
air
pump
to
fill
the
vessel
with
an
atmosphere
as
dense
as
that
in
which
i
had
been
born
and
lived
so
long
then
to
close
the
entrance
window
and
seal
it
hermetically
and
then
to
arrange
the
steering
gear
to
complete
the
first
task
more
easily
i
arrested
the
motion
of
the
vessel
till
she
rose
only
a
few
feet
per
minute
whilst
employed
on
the
air
pump
i
became
suddenly
aware
by
that
instinct
by
which
most
men
have
been
at
one
time
or
another
warned
of
the
unexpected
proximity
of
friend
or
foe
that
i
was
not
alone
turning
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
entrance
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
once
more
the
presence
beheld
in
the
hall
of
the
zinta
but
commanding
enthralling
as
were
those
eyes
they
could
not
now
retain
my
attention
for
beside
that
figure
appeared
one
whose
presence
in
life
or
death
left
me
no
thought
for
aught
beside
i
sprang
forward
seemed
to
touch
her
hand
to
clasp
her
form
to
reach
the
lips
i
bent
my
head
to
meet
and
then
in
the
midst
of
the
bright
sunlight
a
momentary
darkness
veiled
all
from
my
eyes
lifting
my
head
however
my
glance
fell
through
the
window
to
which
the
vision
had
drawn
me
directly
upon
ecasfe
and
upon
the
home
from
which
i
had
taken
her
whose
remains
were
now
being
carried
back
thither
snatching
up
my
i
scanned
the
scene
of
which
i
had
thus
caught
a
momentary
and
confused
glimpse
the
roof
was
occupied
by
a
score
of
men
armed
with
the
lightning
weapon
and
among
them
glanced
the
familiar
badge
the
band
and
silver
star
clambering
over
the
walls
of
the
wide
enclosure
and
threatening
to
storm
the
house
were
a
mob
perhaps
a
thousand
in
number
many
of
them
similarly
armed
the
rest
with
staves
spears
or
such
rude
weapons
as
chance
might
afford
two
minutes
brought
me
immediately
over
them
in
another
i
was
descending
more
rapidly
than
prudence
would
have
suggested
the
strife
seemed
for
a
moment
to
cease
as
one
of
the
crowd
pointed
not
to
the
impending
destruction
overhead
but
to
some
object
apparently
at
an
equal
elevation
to
westward
a
shout
of
welcome
from
the
remaining
defenders
of
the
house
called
right
upward
the
eyes
of
their
assailants
for
an
instant
they
felt
the
bitterness
of
death
a
cry
of
agony
and
terror
that
pierced
even
the
thick
walls
and
windows
of
the
astronaut
reached
my
ears
then
a
violent
shock
threw
me
from
my
feet
springing
up
i
knew
what
wholesale
slaughter
had
avenged
eveena
and
her
father
preserved
her
family
and
given
a
last
victory
to
the
symbol
she
so
revered
in
another
instant
i
was
on
the
roof
and
my
hands
clasped
in
zulve
we
know
she
said
our
darling
brought
us
a
line
that
told
all
and
what
is
left
of
those
who
were
all
to
me
of
her
who
was
so
much
to
you
will
now
be
returned
to
us
almost
at
once
we
were
interrupted
a
cry
drew
my
eyes
to
the
right
where
springing
from
a
balloon
to
the
car
of
which
was
attached
a
huge
flag
emblazoned
with
the
crimson
and
silver
colours
of
the
suzerain
ergimo
stood
before
us
i
am
too
late
he
said
to
save
life
in
time
only
to
put
an
end
to
rebellion
and
avert
murder
the
prince
has
fulfilled
his
promise
to
you
has
repealed
the
law
that
was
to
be
a
weapon
in
the
hands
that
aimed
at
his
life
and
throne
as
at
the
star
and
its
children
the
traitors
save
one
the
worst
have
met
by
this
time
their
just
doom
that
one
i
am
here
to
arrest
but
where
is
our
chief
and
noticing
for
the
first
time
the
group
of
women
who
in
the
violence
of
alarm
and
agony
of
sorrow
had
burst
for
once
unconsciously
the
restraints
of
a
lifetime
where
are
you
alone
alone
for
ever
i
said
and
as
i
spoke
the
procession
that
with
bare
and
bent
heads
carried
two
veiled
forms
into
the
peristyle
below
told
all
he
sought
to
know
i
need
not
dwell
on
the
scene
that
followed
i
scarcely
remember
anything
till
a
chest
of
gold
bearing
the
cipher
which
though
seldom
seen
i
knew
so
well
was
placed
in
my
hands
i
turned
to
zulve
and
to
ergimo
who
stood
beside
her
have
you
need
of
me
i
said
if
i
can
serve
her
house
i
will
remain
willingly
and
as
long
as
i
can
help
or
comfort
no
replied
ergimo
for
zulve
could
not
speak
the
household
of
clavelta
are
safe
and
honoured
henceforth
as
no
other
in
the
land
something
we
must
ask
of
him
who
is
at
any
rate
for
the
present
the
head
of
this
household
and
the
representative
of
the
lineage
it
may
be
he
whispered
that
another
and
his
eyes
fell
on
the
veiled
forms
whose
pink
robes
covered
with
dark
crimson
gauze
indicated
the
younger
matrons
of
the
family
may
yet
give
to
the
children
of
the
star
that
natural
heir
to
the
signet
we
had
hoped
from
your
own
household
but
the
order
can
not
remain
headless
here
zulve
approaching
gave
into
my
hand
the
signet
unclasped
from
her
husband
arm
ere
the
coffer
was
closed
upon
his
form
i
understood
her
meaning
and
as
for
the
time
the
sole
male
representative
of
the
house
i
clasped
it
on
the
arm
of
the
chief
who
succeeded
to
rank
and
to
whom
i
felt
the
care
of
esmo
house
might
be
safely
left
the
due
honour
paid
to
his
new
office
i
turned
to
depart
then
for
the
first
time
my
eyes
fell
on
the
unveiled
countenance
and
drooping
form
of
one
unlike
yet
so
like
eveena
her
favourite
and
nearest
sister
zevle
i
held
out
my
hand
but
emotion
overcoming
the
habits
of
reserve
she
threw
herself
into
my
arms
and
her
tears
fell
on
my
bosom
hardly
faster
than
my
own
as
i
stooped
and
kissed
her
brow
i
had
no
voice
to
speak
my
farewell
but
as
the
astronaut
rose
for
the
last
time
from
the
ground
the
voices
of
my
brethren
chanted
in
adieu
the
last
few
lines
of
the
familiar
formula
peace
be
yours
no
force
can
break
peace
not
death
hath

peril
fear

peace
