the
dwindling
years

to
be
neither
did
he
anticipate
the
horror
of
being
the

nearly
two
hundred
years
of
habit
carried
the
chairman
of
exodus
corporation
through
the
morning
ritual
of
crossing
the
executive
floor
giles
made
the
expected
comments
smiled
the
proper
smiles
and
greeted
his
staff
by
the
right
names
but
it
was
purely
automatic
somehow
thinking
had
grown
difficult
in
the
mornings
recently
inside
his
private
office
he
dropped
all
pretense
and
slumped
into
the
padding
of
his
chair
gasping
for
breath
and
feeling
his
heart
hammering
in
his
chest
been
a
fool
to
come
to
work
he
realized
but
with
the
procyon
shuttle
arriving
yesterday
there
was
no
telling
what
might
turn
up
besides
that
fool
of
a
medicist
had
sworn
the
shot
would
cure
any
allergy
or
asthma
giles
heard
his
secretary
come
in
but
it
until
the
smell
of
the
coffee
reached
his
nose
that
he
looked
up
she
handed
him
a
filled
cup
and
set
the
carafe
down
on
the
surface
of
the
big
desk
she
watched
solicitously
as
he
drank
bad
arthur
she
asked
a
little
tired
he
told
her
refilling
the
cup
made
the
coffee
stronger
than
usual
and
it
seemed
to
cut
through
some
of
the
thickness
in
his
head
guess
getting
old
she
smiled
dutifully
at
the
joke
but
he
knew
she
fooled
cycled
to
middle
age
four
times
in
her
job
and
she
probably
knew
him
better
than
he
knew
be
hard
he
thought
hardly
recognized
the
stranger
in
the
mirror
as
he
tried
to
shave
his
normal
thinness
had
looked
almost
gaunt
and
there
were
hollows
in
his
face
and
circles
under
his
eyes
even
his
hair
had
seemed
thinner
though
that
of
course
was
impossible
urgent
on
the
procyon
shuttle
he
asked
as
she
continue
staring
at
him
with
worried
eyes
she
jerked
her
gaze
away
guiltily
and
turned
to
the
incoming
basket
drugs
for
experimenting
a
personal
letter
for
you
relayed
from
some
place
i
never
heard
of
and
one
of
the
missiles
they
found
it
drifting
half
a
out
and
captured
it
got
a
report
on
it
and
going
crazy
but
if
you
feel
all
right
he
told
her
sharply
then
he
steadied
himself
and
managed
to
smile
for
the
coffee
she
accepted
dismissal
reluctantly
when
she
was
gone
he
sat
gazing
at
the
report
from
jordan
at
research
for
eighty
years
now
been
sending
out
the
little
ships
that
vanished
at
greater
than
the
speed
of
light
equipped
with
every
conceivable
device
to
make
them
return
automatically
after
taking
pictures
of
wherever
they
arrived
so
far
none
had
ever
returned
or
been
located
this
was
the
first
hope
found
that
the
trips
between
stars
in
the
ponderous
shuttles
might
be
ended
and
he
should
have
been
filled
with
excitement
at
hasty
preliminary
report
he
leafed
through
it
the
little
ship
apparently
had
been
picked
up
by
accident
when
it
almost
collided
with
a
ship
scientists
there
had
puzzled
over
it
reset
it
and
sent
it
back
the
two
white
rats
on
it
had
still
been
alive
giles
dropped
the
report
wearily
and
picked
up
the
personal
message
that
had
come
on
the
shuttle
he
fingered
the
microstrip
inside
while
he
drank
another
coffee
and
finally
pulled
out
the
microviewer
there
were
three
frames
to
the
message
he
saw
with
some
surprise
he
need
to
see
the
signature
on
the
first
projection
only
his
youngest
son
would
have
sent
an
elaborate
tercentenary
greeting
that
would
arrive
ninety
years
too
late
harry
had
been
born
just
before
earth
passed
the
drastic
birth
limitation
act
and
his
mother
had
spoiled
him
even
tried
to
avoid
the
compulsory
emigration
draft
and
stay
on
with
his
mother
it
had
been
the
bitter
quarrels
over
that
which
had
finally
broken
fifth
marriage
oddly
enough
the
message
in
the
next
frame
showed
none
of
that
harry
had
nothing
but
praise
for
the
solar
system
where
been
sent
he
barely
mentioned
being
married
on
the
way
or
his
dozen
children
but
filled
most
of
the
frame
with
glowing
description
and
a
plea
for
his
father
to
join
him
there
giles
snorted
and
turned
to
the
third
frame
which
showed
a
group
picture
of
the
family
in
some
sort
of
vehicle
against
the
background
of
an
alien
but
attractive
world
he
had
no
desire
to
spend
ninety
years
cooped
up
with
a
bunch
of
callow
young
emigrants
even
in
one
of
the
improved
exodus
shuttles
and
even
if
exodus
ever
got
the
drive
working
there
was
no
reason
he
should
give
up
his
work
the
discovery
that
men
could
live
practically
forever
had
put
an
end
to
most
family
ties
sentiment
wore
thin
in
half
a
much
time
now
though
it
had
once
seemed
long
enough
strange
how
the
years
seemed
to
get
shorter
as
their
number
increased
been
a
song
about
the
years
dwindling
down
he
groped
for
the
lines
and
remember
drat
it
now
probably
lie
awake
most
of
the
night
again
trying
to
recall
them
the
outside
line
buzzed
musically
flashing
number
giles
grunted
in
irritation
he
ready
to
face
jordan
yet
but
he
shrugged
and
pressed
the
button
the
intense
face
that
looked
from
the
screen
was
frowning
as
eyes
seemed
to
sweep
around
the
room
he
was
still
of
the
few
under
a
hundred
escaped
deportation
because
of
special
patience
was
still
foreign
to
him
then
the
frown
vanished
as
an
expression
of
shock
replaced
it
and
giles
felt
a
sinking
sensation
if
he
looked
but
jordan
looking
at
him
the
interest
lay
in
the
projected
picture
from
harry
across
the
desk
from
the
communicator
his
voice
was
unbelieving
as
he
turned
his
head
to
face
the
older
man
world
is
that
giles
forced
his
attention
on
the
picture
again
and
this
time
he
noticed
the
vehicle
shown
it
was
enough
like
an
old
model
earth
conveyance
to
pass
casual
inspection
but
it
floated
wheellessly
above
the
ground
faint
blur
lines
indicated
it
had
been
moving
when
the
picture
was
taken
of
my
giles
started
to
answer
could
find
the
designation
jordan
cursed
harshly
we
can
send
a
message
on
the
shuttle
begging
for
their
secret
in
a
couple
of
hundred
years
while
a
hundred
other
worlds
make
a
thousand
major
discoveries
they
bother
reporting
the
council
see
giles
had
heard
it
all
before
earth
was
becoming
a
backwater
world
no
real
progress
had
been
made
in
two
centuries
the
young
men
were
sent
out
as
soon
as
their
first
fifty
years
of
education
were
finished
and
the
older
men
were
too
conservative
for
really
new
thinking
there
was
a
measure
of
truth
in
it
unfortunately
slow
up
when
their
populations
fill
giles
repeated
his
old
answers
still
ahead
in
medicine
and
get
the
other
discoveries
eventually
without
interrupting
the
work
of
making
the
earth
fit
for
our
longevity
we
can
wait
have
the
younger
man
stared
at
him
with
the
strange
puzzled
look
giles
had
seen
too
often
lately
it
you
read
my
report
we
know
the
drive
works
that
missile
reached
sirius
in
less
than
ten
days
we
can
have
the
secret
of
this
antigravity
in
less
than
a
year
a
giles
felt
the
thickness
pushing
back
at
his
mind
and
tried
to
fight
it
off
only
skimmed
the
report
but
this
made
no
sense
mean
you
can
calibrate
your
guiding
devices
accurately
enough
to
get
a
missile
where
you
want
it
and
back
voice
rattled
the
speaker
course
not
it
took
two
accidents
to
get
the
thing
back
to
with
a
miss
that
delayed
it
about
twenty
years
before
the
procyon
shuttle
heard
its
signal
a
course
may
take
centuries
if
we
can
ever
master
it
even
with
sirius
expecting
the
missiles
and
ready
to
cooperate
i
mean
the
big
ship
had
it
drafted
for
building
long
enough
now
we
can
finish
it
in
three
months
we
know
the
drive
works
we
know
fast
enough
to
reach
procyon
in
two
weeks
we
even
know
life
can
stand
the
trip
the
rats
were
giles
shook
his
head
at
what
the
other
was
proposing
only
partly
believing
it
have
minds
that
could
show
any
real
damage
such
as
the
loss
of
power
to
rejuvenate
we
put
human
pilots
into
a
ship
with
our
drive
until
tested
it
more
thoroughly
bill
even
if
they
could
correct
for
errors
on
arrival
maybe
if
we
put
in
stronger
signaling
transmitters
maybe
in
two
centuries
have
a
through
route
charted
to
sirius
and
we
still
have
proved
it
safe
for
human
pilots
giles
got
to
have
the
big
ship
all
we
need
is
volunteer
it
occurred
to
giles
then
that
the
man
had
been
too
fired
with
the
idea
to
think
he
leaned
back
shaking
his
head
again
wearily
right
bill
find
me
one
volunteer
or
how
about
you
do
you
really
want
to
risk
losing
the
rest
of
your
life
rather
than
waiting
a
couple
more
centuries
until
we
know
safe
if
you
do
order
the
big
jordan
opened
his
mouth
and
for
a
second
heart
caught
in
a
flux
of
emotions
as
the
offer
hovered
on
his
lips
then
the
engineer
shut
his
mouth
slowly
the
belligerence
ran
out
of
him
he
looked
sick
for
he
had
no
answer
no
sane
man
would
risk
a
chance
for
near
eternity
against
such
a
relatively
short
wait
heroism
had
belonged
to
those
who
knew
their
days
were
numbered
anyhow
it
bill
giles
advised
may
take
longer
but
eventually
find
a
way
with
time
enough
bound
to
and
when
we
do
the
ship
will
be
the
engineer
nodded
miserably
and
clicked
off
giles
turned
from
the
blank
screen
to
stare
out
of
the
windows
while
his
hand
came
up
to
twist
at
the
lock
of
hair
over
his
forehead
eternity
they
had
to
plan
and
build
for
it
they
risk
that
plan
for
benefits
usually
it
was
too
easy
to
realize
that
and
the
sight
of
the
solid
buildings
outside
should
have
given
him
a
sense
of
security
today
though
nothing
seemed
to
help
he
felt
choked
imprisoned
somehow
lost
the
city
beyond
the
window
blurred
as
he
studied
it
and
he
swung
the
chair
back
so
violently
that
his
hand
jerked
painfully
on
the
forelock
been
twisting
then
he
was
staring
unbelievingly
at
the
single
white
hair
that
was
twisted
with
the
dark
ones
between
his
fingers
like
an
automaton
he
bent
forward
his
other
hand
groping
for
the
mirror
that
should
be
in
one
of
the
drawers
the
dull
pain
in
his
chest
sharpened
and
his
breath
was
hoarse
in
his
throat
but
he
hardly
noticed
as
he
found
the
mirror
and
brought
it
up
his
eyes
focused
reluctantly
there
were
other
white
strands
in
his
dark
hair
the
mirror
crashed
to
the
floor
as
he
staggered
out
of
the
office
it
was
only
two
blocks
to
residence
club
but
he
had
to
stop
twice
to
catch
his
breath
and
fight
against
the
pain
that
clawed
at
his
chest
when
he
reached
the
lobby
he
was
barely
able
to
stand
dubbins
was
at
his
side
almost
at
once
with
a
hand
under
his
arm
to
guide
him
toward
his
suite
me
help
you
sir
dubbins
suggested
in
the
tones
giles
heard
since
the
man
had
been
his
valet
back
when
it
was
still
possible
to
find
personal
servants
now
he
managed
the
club
on
a
level
of
with
the
members
for
the
moment
though
slipped
back
into
the
old
ways
giles
found
himself
lying
on
his
couch
partially
undressed
with
the
pillows
just
right
and
a
long
drink
in
his
hand
the
alcohol
combined
with
the
reaction
from
his
panic
to
leave
him
almost
himself
again
after
all
there
was
nothing
to
worry
about
doctors
could
cure
anything
guess
better
call
vincenti
he
decided
vincenti
was
a
member
and
would
probably
be
the
quickest
to
get
dubbins
shook
his
head
vincenti
with
us
sir
he
left
a
year
ago
to
visit
a
son
in
the
centauri
system
a
cobb
whose
reputation
is
very
good
giles
puzzled
over
it
doubtfully
vincenti
had
been
an
oddly
morose
man
the
last
few
times
seen
him
but
that
could
hardly
explain
his
taking
a
shuttle
trip
for
such
a
slim
reason
it
was
no
concern
of
his
though
cobb
then
he
said
giles
heard
the
other
voice
on
the
study
phone
too
low
for
the
words
to
be
distinguishable
he
finished
the
drink
feeling
still
better
and
was
sitting
up
when
dubbins
came
back
cobb
wants
you
to
come
to
his
office
at
once
sir
he
said
dropping
to
his
knee
to
help
giles
with
his
shoes
be
pleased
to
drive
you
giles
frowned
expected
cobb
to
come
to
him
then
he
grimaced
at
his
own
thoughts
manners
must
have
carried
him
back
into
the
past
doctors
go
in
for
home
visits
preferred
to
see
their
patients
in
the
laboratories
that
housed
their
offices
if
this
kept
on
be
missing
the
old
days
when
had
a
mansion
and
counted
his
wealth
in
possessions
instead
of
the
treasures
he
could
build
inside
himself
for
the
future
ahead
he
was
getting
positively
childish
yet
he
relished
the
feeling
of
having
dubbins
drive
his
car
more
than
anything
else
loved
being
driven
even
after
chauffeurs
were
a
thing
of
the
past
harry
had
driven
him
around
now
taken
to
walking
as
so
many
others
had
for
even
with
modern
safety
measures
so
strict
there
was
always
a
small
chance
of
some
accident
and
nobody
had
any
desire
to
spend
the
long
future
as
a
cripple
wait
for
you
sir
dubbins
offered
as
they
stopped
beside
the
low
massive
medical
building
it
was
almost
too
much
consideration
giles
nodded
got
out
and
headed
down
the
hall
uncertainly
just
how
bad
did
he
look
well
soon
find
out
he
located
the
directory
and
finally
found
the
right
office
its
reception
room
wall
covered
with
all
the
degrees
cobb
had
picked
up
in
some
three
hundred
years
of
practice
giles
felt
better
realizing
it
be
one
of
the
younger
men
cobb
appeared
himself
before
the
nurse
could
take
over
and
led
giles
into
a
room
with
an
desk
and
chairs
that
almost
concealed
the
cabinets
of
equipment
beyond
he
listened
as
giles
stumbled
out
his
story
halfway
through
the
nurse
took
a
blood
sample
with
one
of
the
little
mosquito
needles
and
the
machinery
behind
the
doctor
began
working
on
it
friend
told
me
about
the
gray
hair
of
course
cobb
said
at
look
he
smiled
faintly
you
think
people
could
miss
that
in
this
day
and
age
see
he
inspected
it
and
began
making
tests
some
were
older
than
giles
could
reflex
blood
pressure
pulse
and
fluoroscope
others
involved
complicated
little
gadgets
that
ran
over
his
body
while
meters
bobbed
and
wiggled
the
blood
check
came
through
and
cobb
studied
it
to
go
back
and
make
further
inspections
of
his
own
at
last
he
nodded
slowly
of
course
i
thought
it
might
be
how
long
since
you
had
your
last
rejuvenation
and
who
gave
it
ten
years
ago
giles
answered
he
found
his
identity
card
and
passed
it
over
while
the
doctor
studied
it
it
going
right
he
could
feel
it
some
of
the
panic
symptoms
were
returning
the
pulse
in
his
neck
was
pounding
and
his
breath
was
growing
difficult
sweat
ran
down
his
sides
from
his
armpit
and
he
wiped
his
palms
against
his
coat
particular
emotional
strain
when
you
were
major
upset
in
your
life
cobb
asked
giles
thought
as
carefully
as
he
could
but
he
remembered
nothing
like
that
take
but
i
never
had
any
trouble
doctor
i
was
one
of
the
first
million
cases
when
a
lot
of
people
rejuvenate
at
all
and
i
had
no
trouble
even
cobb
considered
it
hesitated
as
if
making
up
his
mind
to
be
frank
against
his
better
judgment
see
any
other
explanation
got
a
slight
case
of
serious
but
quite
well
as
other
signs
of
aging
afraid
the
treatment
take
fully
it
might
have
been
some
unconscious
block
on
your
part
some
infection
not
diagnosed
at
the
time
or
even
a
fault
in
the
treatment
pretty
rare
but
we
neglect
the
he
studied
his
charts
again
and
then
smiled
give
you
another
treatment
any
reason
you
begin
immediately
giles
remembered
that
dubbins
was
waiting
for
him
but
this
was
more
important
it
been
a
joke
about
his
growing
old
after
all
but
now
in
a
few
days
be
his
of
course
young
self
again
they
went
down
the
hall
to
another
office
where
giles
waited
outside
while
cobb
conferred
with
another
doctor
and
technician
with
much
waving
of
charts
he
resented
every
second
of
it
it
was
as
if
the
almost
forgotten
specter
of
age
stood
beside
him
counting
the
seconds
but
at
last
they
were
through
and
he
was
led
into
the
quiet
rejuvenation
room
where
the
clamps
were
adjusted
about
his
head
and
the
earpieces
were
fitted
the
drugs
were
shot
painlessly
into
his
arm
and
the
was
adjusted
to
his
pattern
it
had
been
nothing
like
this
his
first
time
then
it
had
required
months
of
mental
training
followed
by
crude
mechanical
and
drug
hypnosis
for
other
months
somewhere
in
every
human
brain
lay
the
memory
of
what
his
cells
had
been
like
when
he
was
young
or
perhaps
it
lay
in
the
cells
themselves
with
the
brain
as
only
a
linkage
to
it
discovered
that
and
the
fact
that
the
mind
could
effect
physical
changes
in
the
body
even
such
things
as
cancer
could
be
willed
out
of
the
brain
could
be
reached
far
below
the
conscious
level
and
forced
to
operate
there
had
been
impossible
faith
cures
for
removed
from
blinded
eyes
within
minutes
finding
the
mechanism
in
the
brain
that
worked
those
miracles
had
taken
an
incredible
amount
of
study
and
finding
a
means
of
bringing
it
under
control
had
taken
even
longer
now
they
did
it
with
dozens
of
mechanical
aids
in
addition
to
the
hypnotic
did
it
usually
in
a
single
sitting
with
the
full
transformation
of
the
body
taking
less
than
a
week
after
the
treatment
but
with
all
the
equipment
it
impossible
for
a
mistake
to
happen
it
had
been
no
fault
of
his
he
was
sure
of
that
his
mind
was
easy
to
reach
he
could
relax
so
easily
he
came
out
of
it
without
even
a
headache
while
they
were
removing
the
probes
but
the
fatigue
on
the
face
told
him
it
had
been
a
long
and
difficult
job
he
stretched
experimentally
with
the
eternal
unconscious
expectation
that
he
would
find
himself
suddenly
young
again
but
that
of
course
was
ridiculous
it
took
days
for
the
mind
to
work
on
all
the
cells
and
to
repair
the
damage
of
time
cobb
led
him
back
to
the
first
office
where
he
was
given
an
injection
of
some
kind
and
another
sample
of
his
blood
was
taken
while
the
earlier
tests
were
repeated
but
finally
the
doctor
nodded
all
for
now
giles
you
might
drop
in
tomorrow
morning
after
had
a
chance
to
complete
my
study
of
all
this
know
by
then
whether
need
more
treatment
ten
okay
be
all
right
cobb
smiled
the
automatic
reassurance
of
his
profession
lost
a
patient
in
two
hundred
years
to
my
said
giles
is
dubbins
was
still
waiting
reading
a
paper
whose
headlined
feature
carried
a
glowing
account
of
the
discovery
of
the
missile
and
what
it
might
mean
he
took
a
quick
look
at
giles
and
pointed
to
it
work
giles
maybe
all
get
to
see
some
of
those
other
worlds
then
he
studied
giles
more
carefully
in
good
shape
now
sir
doctor
says
going
to
be
fine
giles
answered
it
was
then
he
realized
for
the
first
time
that
cobb
had
said
no
such
thing
a
statement
that
lightning
had
never
struck
a
house
was
no
guarantee
that
it
never
would
it
was
an
evasion
meant
to
give
such
an
impression
the
worry
nagged
at
him
all
the
way
back
word
had
already
gone
around
the
club
that
had
some
kind
of
attack
and
there
were
endless
questions
that
kept
it
on
his
mind
and
even
when
it
had
been
covered
and
recovered
he
could
still
sense
the
glances
of
the
others
as
if
he
were
vincenti
in
one
of
the
more
morose
moods
he
found
a
single
table
in
the
dining
room
and
picked
his
way
through
the
meal
listening
to
the
conversation
about
him
only
when
it
was
necessary
because
someone
called
across
to
him
ordinarily
he
was
quick
to
support
the
idea
of
clubs
in
place
of
private
families
a
man
here
could
choose
his
group
and
grow
into
them
yet
he
swallowed
by
them
as
he
might
be
by
a
family
giles
had
been
living
here
for
nearly
a
century
now
and
never
regretted
it
but
tonight
his
own
group
irritated
him
he
puzzled
over
it
finding
no
real
reason
certainly
they
forcing
themselves
on
him
he
remembered
once
when
had
a
cold
before
they
finally
licked
that
harry
had
been
a
complete
nuisance
running
around
with
various
nostrums
giving
him
no
peace
constant
questions
about
how
he
felt
constant
little
looks
of
been
ready
to
yell
at
the
boy
in
fact
he
had
funny
he
picture
really
losing
his
temper
here
families
did
odd
things
to
a
man
he
listened
to
a
few
of
the
discussions
after
the
dinner
but
heard
them
all
before
except
for
one
about
the
drive
and
there
he
had
no
wish
to
talk
until
he
could
study
the
final
report
he
gave
up
at
last
and
went
to
his
own
suite
what
he
needed
was
a
good
sleep
after
a
little
relaxation
even
that
failed
him
though
developed
one
of
the
finest
chess
collections
in
the
world
but
tonight
it
held
no
interest
and
when
he
drew
out
his
tools
and
tried
working
on
the
delicate
lovely
jade
for
the
set
he
was
carving
his
hands
seemed
to
be
all
thumbs
none
of
the
other
interests
developed
through
the
years
helped
to
add
to
the
richness
of
living
now
he
gave
it
up
and
went
to
have
the
fragment
of
that
song
pop
into
his
head
now
there
was
no
escaping
it
something
about
the
was
it
down
to
something
or
other
could
they
really
dwindle
down
suppose
he
rejuvenate
all
the
way
he
knew
that
there
were
some
people
who
respond
as
well
as
others
sol
graves
for
instance
been
fifty
when
he
finally
learned
how
to
work
with
the
doctors
and
they
could
only
bring
him
back
to
about
thirty
instead
of
the
normal
early
twenties
would
that
reduce
the
slice
of
eternity
that
rejuvenation
meant
and
what
had
happened
to
sol
or
suppose
it
rejuvenation
after
all
suppose
something
had
gone
wrong
with
him
permanently
he
fought
that
off
but
he
escape
the
nagging
doubts
at
the
words
he
got
up
once
to
stare
at
himself
in
the
mirror
ten
hours
had
gone
by
and
there
should
have
been
some
signs
of
improvement
he
be
sure
though
whether
there
were
or
not
he
looked
no
better
the
next
morning
when
he
finally
dragged
himself
up
from
the
little
sleep
managed
to
get
the
hollows
were
still
there
and
the
circles
under
his
eyes
he
searched
for
the
gray
in
his
hair
but
the
traitorous
strands
had
been
removed
at
the
office
and
he
could
find
no
new
ones
he
looked
into
the
dining
room
and
then
went
by
hastily
he
wanted
no
solicitous
glances
this
morning
drat
it
maybe
he
should
move
out
maybe
trying
family
life
again
would
give
him
some
new
interests
amanda
probably
would
be
willing
to
marry
him
hinted
at
a
date
once
he
stopped
shocked
by
the
awareness
that
he
been
out
with
a
woman
for
he
remember
how
long
it
had
been
nor
why
the
spring
a
young
fancy
he
quoted
to
himself
and
then
shuddered
it
been
that
kind
of
spring
for
this
rejuvenation
nor
the
last
nor
the
one
before
that
giles
tried
to
stop
scaring
himself
and
partially
succeeded
until
he
reached
the
office
then
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
frighten
himself
the
wrongness
was
too
strong
no
matter
how
professional
smile
he
hear
the
preliminary
words
he
watched
the
smile
vanish
as
the
stack
of
reports
came
out
there
was
no
nurse
here
now
the
machines
were
all
the
doors
were
shut
giles
shook
his
head
interrupting
the
technical
jargon
now
that
he
knew
there
was
reason
for
his
fear
it
seemed
to
vanish
leaving
a
coldness
that
numbed
him
rather
know
the
whole
truth
he
said
his
voice
sounded
dead
in
his
ears
worst
first
the
rejuvenation
cobb
sighed
and
yet
seemed
relieved
he
stopped
and
his
hands
touched
the
reports
on
his
desk
he
added
in
a
low
defeated
tone
i
thought
that
was
impossible
did
i
believe
it
even
now
i
find
it
the
first
case
i
spent
the
night
at
medical
center
going
up
the
ranks
until
i
found
men
who
really
know
about
it
and
now
i
wish
i
his
voice
ran
down
and
he
gathered
himself
together
by
an
effort
a
shock
to
me
too
giles
to
simplify
it
no
memory
is
cellular
memory
it
loses
a
little
each
time
and
the
effect
is
cumulative
like
an
asymptotic
further
it
goes
the
steeper
the
curve
passed
too
he
faced
away
from
giles
dropping
the
reports
into
a
drawer
and
locking
it
supposed
to
tell
you
of
course
going
to
be
tough
enough
when
ready
to
let
people
know
but
you
the
first
and
you
be
the
last
if
any
consolation
got
a
longer
time
scale
than
we
used
to
in
centuries
not
in
eons
for
everybody
not
just
it
was
no
consolation
giles
nodded
mechanically
talk
of
course
long
cobb
spread
his
hands
unhappily
years
maybe
but
we
can
make
them
better
geriatric
knowledge
is
still
on
record
we
can
fix
the
heart
and
all
the
rest
be
in
good
physical
condition
better
than
your
then
giles
pronounce
the
words
grown
old
and
grow
older
and
eventually
die
an
immortal
man
had
suddenly
found
death
hovering
on
his
trail
the
years
had
dwindled
and
gone
and
only
a
few
were
left
he
stood
up
holding
out
his
hand
you
doctor
he
said
and
was
surprised
to
find
he
meant
it
the
man
had
done
all
he
could
and
had
at
least
saved
him
the
suspense
of
growing
doubt
and
horrible
eventual
discovery
outside
on
the
street
he
looked
up
at
the
sun
and
then
at
the
buildings
built
to
last
for
thousands
of
years
their
eternity
was
no
longer
a
part
of
him
even
his
car
would
outlast
him
he
climbed
into
it
still
partly
numbed
and
began
driving
mechanically
no
longer
wondering
about
the
dangers
that
might
possibly
arise
those
matter
much
now
for
a
man
who
had
thought
of
living
almost
forever
thirty
years
was
too
short
a
time
to
count
he
was
passing
near
the
club
and
started
to
slow
then
he
went
on
without
stopping
he
wanted
no
chance
to
have
them
asking
questions
he
answer
it
was
none
of
their
business
dubbins
had
been
now
giles
wanted
no
kindness
the
street
led
to
the
office
and
he
drove
on
what
else
was
there
for
him
there
at
least
he
could
still
fill
his
time
with
that
might
even
be
useful
in
the
future
men
would
need
the
drive
if
they
were
to
span
much
more
of
the
universe
than
now
and
he
could
speed
up
the
work
in
some
ways
still
even
if
he
could
never
see
its
finish
it
would
be
cold
comfort
but
it
was
something
and
he
might
keep
busy
enough
to
forget
sometimes
that
the
years
were
gone
for
him
automatic
habit
carried
him
through
the
office
again
to
desk
where
her
worry
was
still
riding
her
he
managed
a
grin
and
somehow
the
right
words
came
to
his
lips
saw
the
doctor
amanda
so
you
can
stop
figuring
ways
to
get
me
she
smiled
back
suddenly
without
feigning
it
all
right
all
right
as
ever
be
he
told
her
tell
me
just
growing
this
time
her
laugh
was
heartier
he
caught
himself
before
he
could
echo
her
mirth
in
a
different
voice
and
went
inside
where
she
had
the
coffee
waiting
for
him
oddly
it
still
tasted
good
to
him
the
projection
was
off
he
saw
wondering
whether
left
it
on
or
not
he
snapped
the
switch
and
saw
the
screen
light
up
with
the
people
still
in
the
odd
wheelless
vehicle
on
the
alien
planet
for
a
long
moment
he
stared
at
the
picture
without
thinking
and
then
bent
closer
face
changed
much
giles
had
almost
forgotten
it
but
there
was
still
the
same
grin
there
and
his
grandchildren
had
a
touch
of
it
too
and
of
their
nose
he
thought
funny
never
seen
even
pictures
of
his
other
grandchildren
family
ties
melted
away
too
fast
for
interstellar
travel
yet
there
seemed
to
be
no
slackening
of
them
in
case
and
somehow
it
looked
like
a
family
rather
than
a
mere
group
a
very
pleasant
family
in
a
very
pleasant
world
he
read
note
again
with
its
praise
for
the
planet
and
its
invitation
he
wondered
if
vincenti
had
received
an
invitation
like
that
before
he
left
or
had
he
even
been
one
of
those
to
whom
the
same
report
had
been
delivered
by
some
doctor
it
matter
but
it
would
explain
things
at
least
twenty
years
to
centaurus
while
the
years
dwindled
then
abruptly
the
line
finished
itself
years
dwindle
down
to
a
precious
few
he
remembered
precious
those
dwindling
years
had
been
precious
once
he
unexpectedly
recalled
his
own
grandfather
holding
him
on
an
old
knee
and
slipping
him
candy
that
was
forbidden
the
years
seemed
precious
to
the
old
man
then
voice
came
abruptly
over
the
intercom
wants
to
talk
to
you
she
said
and
the
irritation
was
sharp
in
her
voice
take
no
giles
shrugged
and
reached
for
the
projector
to
cut
it
off
then
on
impulse
he
set
it
back
to
the
picture
studying
the
group
again
as
he
switched
on
wire
but
he
wait
for
the
hot
words
about
whatever
was
the
trouble
he
said
getting
the
big
ship
into
production
found
a
been
driven
to
it
he
knew
as
he
watched
the
amazed
face
snap
from
the
screen
from
the
first
suspicion
of
his
trouble
something
inside
him
had
been
forcing
him
to
make
this
decision
and
maybe
it
would
do
no
good
maybe
the
ship
would
fail
but
thirty
years
was
a
number
a
man
could
risk
if
he
made
it
though
well
see
those
grandchildren
of
his
this
harry
maybe
even
tell
harry
the
truth
once
they
got
done
celebrating
the
reunion
and
be
other
grandchildren
with
the
ship
have
time
enough
to
look
them
up
plenty
of
time
thirty
years
was
a
long
time
when
he

to
think
