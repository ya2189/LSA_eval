on
a
grey
october
afternoon
in
the

in
the
alma

handsome
young

toiling
up
a

laden
with

she
leans
on
a
gate
judkins
a
of
her

drives
up
in
a

and
offers
her
a

home
she
refuses
scornfully
to
the
young
groom
mortification
he
drives
off
hurt
by
her
coquetry
and
prophesying
that
pride
goes
before
a
fall
then
a
sound
of
bells
is
heard
a
waggon
drawn
by
a
fine
climbs
the
hill
and
stops
by
alma
she
accepts
the
waggoner
offer
of
a
lift
and
on
reaching
the
gate
of
her
home
in
the
dusk
is
distressed
by
his
insistence
on
a
kiss
in
payment
when
out
of
the
steps

the
graceful
and

is
welcomed
with
respectful
affection
as
the
rector
son
and
alma
former
playmate
afterwards
she
lights
him
to
the
gate
where
a
chance
word
of
his
evokes
from
her
an
innocent
and
unconscious
betrayal
of
her
secret
love
kindling
such
strong
response
in
him
as
he
can
not
conquer
except
by
touching
a
letter
in
his
pocket

letter
is
from
marion

he
has
been

great
haste
to

some
selfishness

walks
to
his
lodging
in
a
neighbouring
village
where
trifling
circumstances
point
to
a
refined
sensuousness
and
sophistry

character

in
great
mental
anguish
goes
to

house
and
incidentally
puts
to
a
brother
clergyman
there
a
case

conscience
should
a
man
who
has
acted
unwisely
and
is
guilty
of
unintentional
homicide
imperil
a
useful
and
brilliant
career
by
confession
not
if
he
had
such
great
gifts
and
opportunities
of
doing
good
as
cyril
has
he
is
told
by
this
pronouncement
and
a
love
scene
with
marion
cyril
is
much
comforted
in
the
meantime
ben
lee
death
is
by
many
being
imputed
to
everard
who
is
quite
unconscious
of
these
suspicions
he
is
much
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
policemen
at
the
rectory
that
afternoon
and
still
more
so
at
being
arrested
on
the
charge
of
murdering
lee
after
due
examination
everard
is
committed
for
trial
on
the
charge
of
murder
his
best
witness
granfer
who
had
seen
and
spoken
with
him
in
the
village
at
the
moment
of
the
alleged
murder
greatly
discredited
his
evidence
by
his
circumlocution
and
stupidity
purposely
affected
to
set
the
court
in
a
roar
he
admitted
that
everard
gave
him
money
and
tobacco
judkins
swore
that
at
three
lee
told
him
everard
had
asked
alma
to
meet
him
at
dusk
that
evening
in
the
wood
and
that
he
lee
meant
to
follow
everard
there
and
exact
reparation
from
him
that
alma
and
everard
were
known
to
be
together
in
the
wood
on
the
morning
of
lee
death
when
everard
was
with
lilian
and
that
he
himself
had
seen
them
meet
often
clandestinely
in
the
spring
during
lee
illness
when
letters
books
and
flowers
had
passed
between
them
on
the
eve
of
lee
death
he
had
seen
everard
go
into
the
copse
at
dusk
carrying
a
heavy
stick
ingram
swaynestone
grove
the
waggoner
and
stevens
the
sexton
all
saw
everard
going
on
the
upland
path
to
swaynestone
but
the
blacksmith
swore
to
seeing
him
in
the
village
street
at
the
same
hour
a
keeper
saw
him
going
to
the
copse
at
the
same
time
that
a
shepherd
met
him
on
the
down
going
in
another
direction
at
five
two
rectory
maids
saw
everard
run
in
by
the
back
door
and
upstairs
followed
by
the
cat
he
made
no
reply
when
miss
maitland
spoke
to
him
an
hour
later
everard
asked
the
cook
for
raw
meat
for
a
black
eye
which
he
said
he
got
by
running
against
a
tree
in
the
dark
blood
was
found
in
a
basin
in
his
room
and
on
the
grey
suit
which
was
much
stained
and
torn
as
if
by
a
struggle
a
handkerchief
of
everard
was
found
in
the
wood
also
a
stick
he
had
been
seen
with
in
the
morning
everard
evidence
at
the
inquest
was
that
he
left
malbourne
rectory
about
four
wearing
a
black
coat
met
the
blacksmith
in
the
village
and
the
shepherd
on
the
down
and
finding
the
cottage
on
the
down
empty
returned
seeing
no
one
till
he
met
granfer
at
malbourne
cross
and
reached
the
rectory
at
six
where
a
romp
with
winnie
maitland
gave
him
the
black
eye
that
he
promised
her
not
to
speak
about
he
could
not
account
for
the
blood
found
on
his
clothes
cyril
is
much
shocked
by
the
verdict
and
committal
of
everard
but
is
sure
that
he
will
be
cleared
he
must
be
cleared
he
says
any
pending
the
assize
trial
he
baptises
three
unknown
babes
in
malbourne
church
when
asking
the
name
of
one
of
the
children
in
his
arms
he
is
told
benjamin
lee
his
evident
deep
emotion
at
this
evokes
sympathy
from
all
present
during
the
trial
at
belminster
he
has
a
great
spiritual
conflict
in
the
cathedral
while
a
fugue
of
bach
is
played
on
the
organ
suggesting
a
combat
between
the
powers
of
evil
and
good
but
he
feels
that
he
renounce
his
brilliant
prospects
coming
out
he
hears
that
alma
has
declared
everard
is
the
man
who
was
with
her
father
when
he
met
his
death
in
the
struggle
she
heard
while
outside
the
copse
cyril
at
once
rushes
to
the
court
which
he
had
only
left
for
an
hour
just
in
time
to
hear
the
verdict
manslaughter
stop
he
cries
i
have
evidence
the
prisoner
is
innocent
the
judge
not
understanding
what
he
says
orders
his
removal
his
friends
thinking
him
distracted
persuade
him
to
be
quiet
while
the
utmost
sentence
twenty
years
is
given
on
hearing
this
cyril
with
a
loud
cry
falls
senseless
he
remains
in
delirium
many
weeks
a
pathetic
farewell
between
henry
and
lilian
who
is
the
only
believer
in
his
innocence
and
who
renews
her
promise
to
him
closes
the
first
part
the
tragedy
faintly
foreshadowed
from
the
first
line
and
gradually
developed
from
cyril
and
irrepressible
joy
in
alma
unguarded
betrayal
of
unconscious
passion
has
darkened
the
whole
story
sin
has
engendered
sin
cyril
noble
purpose
to
devote
himself
entirely
to
his
high
calling
and
be
worthy
of
it
has
become
pitiless

his
spiritual
pride
and
egoism
his
ready
tact
social
charm
and
power
of
psychological
analysis
subtle
sophistry
and
his
warmest
affection
disguised
his
finest
qualities
perverted
lead
to
his
lowest
fall
his
weak
and
belated
attempt
to
right

killed

has
turned
to

idolatry
laying

and
working

has
delayed

his

till
it
is
too
late
to

not

nor

the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world

medicine
again
to
him
that

he
had
before
his
guilt
the
darkness
of
a
a
summer
sunday
two
years
later
alma
and
her
child
in
a
cornfield
listening
to
bells
ringing
for
cyril
homecoming
with
his
bride
all
the
softness
and
youth
gone
from
alma
tragic
face
and
the
last
gleams
of
penitence
from
her
heart
since
her
perjury
jealousy
is
prompting
her
to
go
and
tell
marion
all
but
judkins
comes
and
interrupts
these
wild
thoughts
he
offers

and
a
home

she
hesitates
she
is
shunned
by
all
and
can
get
no
work
in
malbourne
but
has
not
been
destitute
money
has
found
its
way
mysteriously
to
her
cottage
so
for
the
child
sake
she
accepts
tea
on
the
rectory
lawn
lilian
is
thinking
of
the
prisoner
lennie
wondering
aloud
how
does
alma
having
to
go
to
hell
for
lying
about
henry
cyril
is
terribly
agitated
at
this
he
has
scarcely
yet
recovered
from
his
long
mental
illness
after
henry
sentence
marion
is
she
may
never
allude
to
henry
the
slightest
reference
to
him
makes
cyril
later
in
the
moonlight
ingram

asks
lilian
whom
he

he
can
not

all
to

to

there

no

no

anywhere
he
cried
but
in
time
lilian
periodic
letters
gave
him
heart
and
hope
and
he
had
accepted
his
fate
bravely
trying
to
lift
up
and
cheer
his
prisoners
in
the
darkness
and
uproar
of
a
thunderstorm
he
escapes
from

his

unrecognized
in

his

roadside
unconscious
from
hunger
and
exhaustion
this
part
of
the
story
concludes
with
the
reception
of
this
news
by
lilian
and
cyril
whose
unintentional
neglect
has
caused
the
miscarriage
of
a
letter
that
would
have
enabled
henry
to
escape
i
will
confess
my
wickedness
everard
is
free
and
wearing
the
grey
suit
of
a
discharged
prisoner
is
travelling
from
dartmoor
to
london
by
train
marion
his
brother
leslie
maitland
and
the
admiral
are
all
dead
everything
is
strange
and
changed
to
him
liberty
is
sweet
and
bitter
he
is
prematurely
aged
and
broken
down
the
great
future
that
had
been
before
him
is
now
for
ever
impossible
his
still
undeveloped
scientific
theories
and
discoveries
have
been
anticipated
by
others
he
feels
the
prison
taint
upon
him
he
will
not
see
lilian
until
it
is
removed
and
he
has
become
accustomed
to
the
bewilderment
of
freedom
after
a
few
days
pause
he
starts
from
london
for
malbourne
stopping
at
belminster
through
which
he
had
made
his
last
free
journey
with
cyril
when
he
told
him
that
an
ascetic
is
a
rake
turned
monk
passing
the
gaol
in
which
he
had
suffered
so
much
he
goes
to
the
cathedral
he
asks
who
is
now
dean
of
belminster
the
verger
is
surprised
where
have
you
been
sir
not
to
have
heard
of
the
celebrated
dean
maitland
the
great
dean
the
books
he
has
written
the
things
he
has
done
all
the
world
knows
dean
maitland
the
greatest
preacher
in
the
church
of
england
the
deanery
interior
cyril
charming
and
adored
as
ever
is
considering
whether
he
shall
accept
the
historic
bishopric
of
warham
a
strange
youth
from
america
is
announced
and
asks
the
dean
to
give
him
a
university
education
because
i
am
your
son
since
when
returns
the
dean
tranquilly
have
you
been
suffering
from
this
distressing
illusion
the
youth
bears
a
letter
from
alma
she
is
dying
in
belminster
and
implores
him
to
come
to
her
she
can
not
die
she
writes
till
she
has
cleared
everard
after
this
terrible
scene
cyril
is
in
agony
and
nearly
commits
suicide
but
one
sin
in
a
life
so
spotless
he
moans
the
same
evening
everard
overwhelmed
with
accounts
of
good
deeds
and
spiritual
counsels
and
examining
with
mingled
awe
and
pity
the
numerous
books
he
has
written
goes
to
hear
one
of
the
anglican
chrysostom
lectures
to
working
men
in
the
cathedral
the
music
heard
by
cyril
during
his
mental
conflict
there
years
before
is
being
played
cyril
thinks
lee
death
and
henry
suffering
the
work
of
fate
since
in
wearing
everard
clothes
he
had
no
thought
of
impersonating
him
but
only
of
avoiding
the
publicity
of
clerical
dress
nor
had
he
dreamed
of
meeting
or
of
struggling
with
ben
lee
meaning
to
go
to
alma
who
is
already
dead
later
on
that
night
cyril
preaches
upon
the
sin
of
judas
with
great
power
and
passion
i
charge
you
my
brothers
beware
of
everard
pities
him
he
feels
that
his
own
eighteen
years
sufferings
were
nothing
in
comparison
with
cyril
secret
tortures
suddenly
the
preacher
stops
with
a
low
cry
of
agony
he
has
caught
everard
eye
he
wishes
the
cathedral
would
fall
and
crush
him
i
am
not
well
he
says
leaving
the
pulpit
everard
writes
him
a
letter
that
night
saying
he
has
long
known
and
forgiven
all
he
asks
cyril
to
use
his
own
secret
repentance
and
unspoken
agony
for
the
spiritual
help
of
others
the
dean
receives
and
reads
the
letter
at
breakfast
next
morning
he
then
shuts
himself
alone
in
his
study
for
several
hours
then
he
takes
leave
of
his
blind
son
and
only
surviving
daughter
all
the
other
children
died
in
infancy
and
sends
them
away
to
a
relative
everard
after
waiting
vainly
for
cyril
answer
goes
to
malbourne
he
travels
in
the
same
carriage
as
the
judge
who
had
sentenced
him
and
tells
him
that
he
was
innocent
but
is
unable
to
clear
himself
nobody
recognises
him
at
malbourne
he
hears
his
case
discussed
at
the
village
inn
where
he
stops
an
hour
too
much
agitated
to
go
to
the
rectory
he
never
done
it
is
the
general
verdict
then
follows
the
pathetic
meeting
of
henry
and
lilian
maitland
had
gradually
ceased
to
believe
in
his
guilt
but
i
could
never
forgive
the
man
who
let
you
suffer
in
his
stead
he
says
lilian
shudders
at
this
cyril
is
discussed
our
dear
chrysostom
our
next
day
sunday
old
friends
welcome
everard
he
has
a
great
reception
from
the
villagers
lilian
presses
him
to
say
who
was
the
guilty
man
mark
antony
the
cat
is
still
alive
only
once
did
mark
make
a
mistake
she
says
when
he
ran
after
grey
figure
in
the
else
he
never
ran
after
any
but
myself
and
cyril
henry
you
who
killed
ben
lee
tell
me
she
sobs
oh
tell
me
it
was
not
henry
can
not
tell
her
lilian
is
deeply
distressed
his
burden
was
heavier
than
mine
henry
says
he
comforts
her
the
same
day
at
morning
prayer
cyril
enters
the
cathedral
the
organ
is
playing
mendelssohn
o
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
the
cathedral
is
packed
with
people
of
all
degrees
known
and
unknown
friends
and
strangers
the
thought
that
all
these
will
soon
know
his
shame
turns
cyril
sick
the
faces
of
all
those
he
has
injured
rise
and
reproach
him
he
goes
through
another
great
spiritual
conflict
but
his
soul
emerges
at
last
stripped
of
all
pretence
in
the
awful
presence
of
his
maker
shuddering
with
the
shame
of
its
uncovered
sin
and
alone
he
nerves
himself
to
an
effort
beyond
his
strength
as
he
stands
in
the
pulpit
before
the
innumerable
gaze
of
the
vast
congregation
by
holding
letter
as
a
talisman
in
his
hand
thus
he
preaches
his
last
and
greatest
sermon
i
will
confess
my
wickedness
and
be
sorry
for
my
sin
this
he
does
literally
he
tells
the
whole
story
in
detail
but
without
names
sometimes
unable
to
go
on
for
agony
and
shame
sometimes
with
tears
streaming
from
his
eyes
he
tells
it
there
that
all
may
take
warning
from
him
he
intends
to
give
himself
up
to
justice
as
soon
as
possible
he
does
not
spare
himself
since
his
first
sin
he
says
i
have
not
had
one
happy
hour
he
never
repented
though
always
consumed
with
remorse
until
his
friend
forgave
him
that
broke
my
stony
heart
he
says
the
congregation
are
deeply
moved
and
horrified
many
think
he
is
under
a
delusion
caused
by
sorrow
for
his
friend
and
mental
strain
having
finished
in
the
usual
way
he
sat
down
in
the
pulpit
and
neither
spoke
nor
moved
again
there
he
was
found
later
dead
next
day
henry
who
deeply
moved
has
watched
by
the
dead
body
of
the
dean
in
his
library
has
to
break
the
news
of
cyril
death
to
maitland
in
the
very
room
in
which
maitland
had
accused
him
of
cyril
crime
and
given
him
up
to
the
police
the
adoring
father
mind
gives
way
under
the
blow
his
memory
is
permanently
confused
and
he
lives
tranquilly
on
for
some
years
in
the
belief
that
cyril
has
only
gone
away
for
a
few
days
the
story
ends
with
a
family
scene
by
lake
leman
where
henry
and
lilian
happily
married
are
living
for
a
time
with
maitland
and
cyril
children
whom
henry
has
kept
from
knowing
their
father
guilt
gerald
griffin
the
collegians
gerald
griffin
born
at
limerick
on
december
was
one
of
the
group
of
clever
irishmen
who
in
imitation
of
tom
moore
sought
literary
fame
in
london
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
was
writing
tales
of
munster
life
in
he
became
popular
through
the
tale
of
the
collegians
here
epitomised
a
tale
that
has
held
the
stage
to
the
present
day
under
the
title
of
the
colleen
bawn
nine
years
later
griffin
renounced
literature
returned
to
ireland
and
entered
the
church
and
on
june
died
in
a
monastery
at
cork
a
tragedy
written
in
his
early
days
was
produced
successfully
by
macready
after
griffin
death
his
fame
however
depends
on
his
pictures
of
irish
life
and
they
are
concentrated
best
in
the
literary
accessories
of
the
present
melodrama
a
secret
at
a
pleasure
garden
on
a
hill
near
limerick
eily
the
beautiful
daughter
of
mihil
the
first
met
hardress
cregan
a
young
gentleman
fresh
from
college
and
on
the
same
night
as
she
and
her
father
were
returning
homeward
they
were
attacked
by
a
rabble
of
men
and
boys
and
rescued
by
the
stranger
and
his
hunchbacked
companion
danny
mann
a
few
days
afterwards
danny
mann
visited
the
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
eily
and
from
that
time
the
girl
character
seemed
to
have
undergone
a
change
her
recreations
and
her
attire
became
gayer
but
her
cheerfulness
of
mind
was
gone
her
lover
myles
murphy
a
farmer
from
killarney
gained
over
her
father
to
his
interests
and
the
old
man
pressed
her
either
to
give
consent
to
the
match
or
a
good
reason
for
her
refusal
after
a
distressing
altercation
eily
left
the
house
without
a
word
of
farewell
she
had
married
hardress
cregan
secretly
and
the
priest
had
died
immediately
after
the
ceremony
the
first
time
she
was
seen
but
not
recognised
in
her
boyish
husband
company
was
by
the
dalys
to
which
family
his
and
intimate
friend
kyrle
daly
belonged
a
boat
passed
along
the
river
before
their
house
containing
a
hooded
girl
the
hunchback
and
hardress
cregan
himself
after
they
had
disappeared
kyrle
daly
rode
to
pay
court
to
anne
chute
hardress
cousin
and
to
his
great
distress
learned
that
she
could
never
be
his
wife
although
she
had
no
other
engagement
from
her
manner
he
realised
that
he
had
a
rival
and
the
knowledge
plunged
him
into
the
deepest
despair
after
her
refusal
he
went
to
spend
the
night
at
one
of
his
father
dairy
farms
a
few
miles
down
the
river
whilst
supper
was
being
prepared
word
came
that
hardress
boat
was
being
swamped
with
every
soul
aboard
the
collegian
however
brought
the
boat
safely
to
the
shore
and
procured
a
room
for
his
wife
in
the
cottage
passing
her
off
as
a
relative
of
danny
mann
she
retired
at
once
and
hardress
and
kyrle
sat
talking
together
of
anne
chute
the
sight
of
his
sufferings
won
hardress
sympathies
he
protested
his
disbelief
in
the
idea
of
another
attachment
and
recommended
perseverance
trust
everything
to
me
he
said
for
your
sake
i
will
take
some
pains
to
become
better
known
to
this
extraordinary
girl
and
you
may
depend
on
it
you
shall
not
suffer
in
my
good
report
when
the
household
was
asleep
hardress
went
to
his
wife
room
and
found
her
troubled
because
of
the
strangeness
of
their
circumstances
i
was
thinking
she
said
what
a
it
would
be
to
my
father
if
anyone
put
it
into
his
head
that
the
case
was
worse
than
it
is
no
more
would
be
wanting
but
just
a
little
word
on
a
scrap
of
paper
to
let
him
know
that
he
need
be
uneasy
and
he
know
all
in
time
the
suggestion
appeared
to
jar
against
the
young
husband
inclinations
he
replied
that
if
she
wished
he
would
return
with
her
to
her
home
and
declare
the
marriage
if
you
are
determined
on
certainly
destroying
our
happiness
he
continued
your
will
shall
be
dearer
to
me
than
fortune
or
friends
if
you
have
a
father
to
feel
for
you
you
will
not
forget
my
love
that
i
have
a
mother
whom
i
love
as
tenderly
and
whose
feelings
deserve
some
consideration
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
in
a
soothing
manner
come
dry
those
sweet
eyes
while
i
tell
you
shortly
what
my
plans
shall
be
he
said
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
danny
mann
sister
who
lives
on
the
side
of
the
purple
mountain
in
the
gap
of
dunlough
i
have
had
two
neat
rooms
fitted
up
for
you
in
her
cottage
and
you
can
have
books
to
read
and
a
little
garden
to
amuse
you
and
a
kerry
pony
to
ride
over
the
mountains
in
the
meantimes
i
will
steal
a
visit
now
and
then
to
my
mother
who
spends
the
autumn
in
the
neighbourhood
i
will
gradually
let
her
into
my
secret
and
obtain
her
forgiveness
i
am
certain
she
will
not
withhold
it
i
shall
then
present
you
to
her
she
will
commend
your
modesty
and
gentleness
we
will
send
for
your
father
and
then
where
is
the
tongue
that
shall
venture
to
wag
against
the
fame
of
eily
cregan
the
young
man
left
her
a
little
chagrined
at
her
apparent
slowness
in
appreciating
his
noble
condescension
in
his
boyhood
he
had
entertained
a
passion
for
his
cousin
anne
chute
but
after
the
long
separation
of
school
and
college
he
had
imagined
that
his
early
love
was
completely
forgotten
the
feeling
with
which
he
regarded
her
now
was
rather
of
resentment
than
indifference
and
it
had
been
with
a
secret
creeping
of
the
heart
that
he
had
witnessed
what
he
thought
was
the
successful
progress
of
kyrle
daly
attachment
it
was
under
those
circumstances
that
he
formed
his
present
hasty
union
with
eily
his
love
for
her
was
deep
sincere
and
tender
her
entire
and
unbounded
confidence
her
extreme
beauty
her
simplicity
and
timid
deference
made
a
soothing
compensation
to
his
heart
for
the
coldness
of
the
haughty
though
superior
beauty
whose
inconstancy
had
raised
his
indignation
in
the
morning
accompanied
by
eily
and
danny
mann
he
sailed
for
ballybunion
where
they
rested
in
a
cavern
while
the
hunchback
sought
an
eligible
lodging
for
the
night
during
his
absence
hardress
told
eily
that
danny
mann
was
his
and
that
he
himself
had
been
the
cause
of
the
poor
fellow
deformity
when
we
were
children
he
was
my
constant
companion
he
said
familiarity
produced
a
feeling
of
equality
on
which
he
presumed
so
far
as
to
offer
rudeness
to
a
little
relative
of
mine
a
miss
chute
who
was
on
a
visit
to
my
mother
she
complained
to
me
and
my
vengeance
was
summary
i
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
hurled
him
with
desperate
force
to
the
bottom
of
a
flight
of
stairs
an
injury
was
done
to
his
spine
but
danny
mann
had
shown
naught
but
good
nature
and
kindly
feeling
ever
since
his
attachment
had
become
the
attachment
of
a
zealot
hardress
was
sometimes
alarmed
at
the
profane
importance
he
attached
to
his
master
wishes
he
seemed
to
care
but
little
what
laws
he
might
transgress
when
the
gratification
of
hardress
inclination
was
in
question
a
week
afterwards
hardress
visited
his
parents
at
their
killarney
residence
to
find
that
his
mother
with
her
niece
anne
chute
had
gone
to
a
grand
ball
in
the
neighbourhood
his
father
was
spending
the
night
with
his
boon
fellows
and
a
favourite
old
huntsman
lay
dying
in
a
room
near
by
this
retainer
told
his
young
master
that
anne
chute
loved
him
well
and
that
she
deserved
a
better
fortune
than
to
love
without
return
hardress
went
to
bed
and
was
awakened
by
his
mother
upon
her
return
she
reproved
him
for
his
long
absence
and
told
him
of
the
sensation
his
beautiful
cousin
was
making
in
society
in
the
morning
he
met
anne
with
some
consciousness
and
distress
a
womanly
reserve
and
delicacy
made
the
girl
unwilling
to
affect
an
intimacy
that
might
not
be
graciously
acknowledged
she
treated
him
coldly
and
began
to
read
some
silly
novel
of
the
day
ah
eily
my
own
own
eily
he
murmured
to
himself
you
are
worth
this
fine
lady
a
hundred
times
over
his
mother
appeared
her
raillery
entrapped
both
him
and
anne
in
a
scene
of
coquetry
no
longer
embarrassed
by
the
feeling
of
strangeness
and
apprehension
which
had
depressed
her
spirits
on
their
first
meeting
after
his
return
from
college
anne
now
assumed
ease
and
liveliness
of
manner
every
hour
he
spent
in
her
society
removed
from
his
mind
the
prejudice
he
had
conceived
against
her
and
supplied
its
place
with
a
feeling
of
strong
kindness
when
he
left
the
merry
circle
to
return
to
eily
blank
regret
fell
suddenly
upon
his
heart
but
the
sorrow
which
anne
manifested
at
his
departure
and
the
cordial
pleasure
with
which
she
heard
of
his
intention
to
return
soon
inspired
him
with
the
strangest
happiness
the
next
time
he
thought
of
eily
and
his
cousin
the
conjunction
was
less
favourable
to
the
former
my
poor
little
love
he
thought
how
much
she
has
to
learn
before
she
can
assume
with
comfort
to
herself
the
place
for
which
i
have
designed
her
at
the
cottage
eily
received
him
with
rapture
and
affection
and
every
other
feeling
was
banished
from
his
mind
but
in
the
course
of
the
evening
she
remarked
that
he
was
more
silent
and
abstracted
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
and
that
he
more
frequently
spoke
in
connection
of
some
little
breach
of
etiquette
or
inelegance
of
manner
than
in
those
terms
of
eloquent
praise
and
fondness
which
he
was
accustomed
to
lavish
upon
her
the
next
day
he
returned
to
his
mother
house
leaving
her
in
tears
that
night
cregan
gave
a
ball
at
which
he
was
one
of
the
gayest
revellers
soon
afterwards
his
mother
also
told
him
that
anne
was
in
love
and
with
none
other
than
himself
in
great
agitation
he
replied
that
he
had
already
pledged
himself
to
another
she
insisted
that
any
other
engagement
must
be
broken
since
if
there
was
to
be
a
victim
it
should
not
be
anne
the
lady
violent
maternal
affection
overruled
him
and
in
spite
of
the
call
of
honour
he
dared
not
tell
her
that
he
was
already
married
during
the
ensuing
weeks
eily
perceived
a
rapid
and
fearful
change
in
his
temper
and
appearance
his
visits
were
fewer
and
shorter
and
his
manner
became
extraordinarily
restrained
and
conscious
but
when
she
told
him
that
the
loneliness
was
troubling
her
he
accused
her
of
jealousy
if
i
was
jealous
and
with
reason
said
eily
smiling
seriously
nobody
would
ever
know
it
for
i
would
say
a
word
only
stretch
upon
my
bed
and
die
i
would
be
long
in
his
way
i
engage
hardress
warned
her
never
to
inquire
into
his
secrets
nor
to
effect
an
influence
which
he
would
not
admit
he
bade
her
avoid
suffering
the
slightest
suspicion
to
appear
since
when
suspicions
are
afloat
men
find
the
temptation
to
furnish
them
with
a
cause
almost
irresistible
eily
protested
that
she
was
joking
and
his
uneasy
conscience
threw
him
into
a
paroxysm
of
fury
curse
on
you
he
cried
curse
on
your
beauty
curse
on
my
own
folly
for
i
have
been
undone
by
both
i
hate
you
take
the
truth
i
not
be
poisoned
with
it
i
am
sick
of
you
you
have
disgusted
me
i
will
ease
my
heart
by
telling
you
the
whole
if
i
seek
the
society
of
other
women
it
is
because
i
find
not
among
them
your
meanness
and
vulgarity
oh
hardress
shrieked
the
affrighted
girl
you
are
not
in
earnest
now
i
do
joke
he
exclaimed
with
a
hoarse
vehemence
oh
my
dear
hardress
listen
to
me
hear
your
poor
eily
for
one
moment
oh
my
poor
father
forgive
me
hardress
i
left
my
home
and
all
for
you
oh
do
not
cast
me
off
i
will
do
anything
to
please
you
i
will
never
open
my
lips
again
only
say
you
do
not
mean
all
that
he
tore
himself
away
leaving
eily
unconscious
on
the
ground
on
the
summit
of
the
purple
mountain
which
was
all
surrounded
by
mist
he
met
danny
mann
and
confided
to
him
that
his
love
of
eily
had
turned
to
hatred
asking
his
advice
concerning
what
must
be
done
sorrow
trouble
would
i
even
give
myself
about
her
said
danny
only
send
her
home
packin
to
her
father
should
i
send
eily
home
to
earn
for
myself
the
reputation
of
a
faithless
villain
said
hardress
why
then
i
tell
you
what
i
do
said
danny
nodding
his
head
pay
her
passage
out
to
quaybec
an
put
her
aboard
of
a
do
by
her
as
you
do
to
dat
glove
you
have
on
your
hand
make
it
come
off
as
well
as
it
comes
on
an
if
it
fits
too
tight

the
knife
to
it

more

any
questions
only
if

are
agreeable
take
off
that
glove
an
give
it
to
me
for
a
token
lave
the
rest
to
danny
hardress
gazed
upon
the
face
of
the
hunchback
with
an
expression
of
gaping
terror
as
if
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
the
arch
tempter
himself
then
he
caught
him
by
the
throat
and
shook
him
with
appalling
violence
if
you
ever
dare
again
to
utter
a
word
or
meditate
a
thought
of
evil
against
that
unhappy
creature
he
cried
i
will
tear
you
limb
from
limb
between
my
hands
found
drowned
hardress
had
left
eily
almost
unprovided
with
funds
after
a
few
weeks
she
was
obliged
to
write
for
pecuniary
assistance
the
letter
was
unheeded
she
borrowed
a
pony
and
went
to
ask
advice
from
her
brother
father
of
castle
island
the
priest
received
her
very
coldly
but
became
deeply
moved
upon
hearing
that
she
was
legally
married
she
begged
him
to
inform
her
father
that
she
hoped
soon
to
ask
his
pardon
for
all
the
sorrow
she
had
caused
he
gave
her
all
the
money
he
had
and
she
returned
to
the
cottage
danny
mann
delivered
eily
letter
and
sat
drinking
with
his
master
in
cregan
anne
chute
entered
and
finding
the
man
she
loved
in
an
intoxicated
condition
she
withdrew
in
sorrow
and
disgust
he
asked
the
girl
forgiveness
when
soberness
returned
and
she
told
him
that
she
was
greatly
distressed
because
of
his
changed
manner
for
a
long
time
past
there
had
been
a
distressing
series
of
misconceptions
on
her
part
and
of
inconsistencies
on
his
she
could
not
explain
how
deeply
troubled
she
felt
the
intoxication
of
passion
overcame
hardress
and
he
told
her
that
the
key
to
everything
was
that
he
loved
her
she
forgave
him
and
he
was
about
to
send
a
reassuring
line
to
his
mother
when
he
found
in
his
hands
a
portion
of
eily
letter
in
which
she
begged
him
to
let
her
go
back
to
her
father
he
turned
white
with
fear
but
cregan
entered
and
her
strong
will
overbore
his
scruples
he
declared
himself
ready
to
marry
his
beautiful
cousin
then
he
sought
danny
mann
and
reminded
him
of
his
suggestion
about
hiring
a
passage
for
eily
in
a
north
american
vessel
you
bade
me
draw
my
glove
from
off
my
hand
and
give
it
for
a
warrant
he
said
plucking
off
the
glove
slowly
finger
by
finger
my
mind
is
altered
i
married
too
young
i
did
know
my
own
mind
i
am
burning
with
this
thralldom
here
is
my
glove
danny
took
it
whilst
they
exchanged
a
look
of
cold
and
fatal
intelligence
hardress
gave
him
a
purse
and
repeated
that
eily
must
not
stay
in
ireland
that
three
thousand
miles
of
roaring
ocean
were
a
security
for
silence
not
a
hair
of
her
head
must
be
hurt
but
he
would
never
see
her
more
then
he
wrote
on
the
back
of
eily
letter
instructions
for
her
to
put
herself
under
the
bearer
care
and
he
would
restore
her
to
her
father
she
determined
to
obey
at
once
and
without
a
murmur
and
at
nightfall
left
the
cottage
in
danny
company
two
hours
afterwards
hardress
himself
arrived
in
a
fit
of
compunction
on
learning
that
they
had
departed
he
swore
to
himself
that
if
this
his
servant
exceeded
his
views
he
would
tear
his
flesh
from
his
bones
and
gibbet
him
as
a
miscreant
and
a
ruffian
the
night
grew
wild
and
stormy
a
thunderstorm
broke
over
the
hill
hardress
slumbered
in
his
chair
crying
out
my
glove
my
glove
you
used
it
against
my
meaning
i
meant
but
banishment
we
shall
be
hanged
for
this
he
awoke
from
a
fearsome
nightmare
and
unable
to
remain
longer
in
the
cottage
ran
home
with
the
speed
of
one
distracted
there
he
rebuked
his
mother
wildly
telling
her
that
she
had
forced
him
into
madness
and
that
he
was
free
to
execute
her
will
to
marry
or
hang
whichever
she
pleased
his
love
of
anne
now
became
entirely
dormant
and
he
was
able
to
estimate
the
greatness
of
his
guilt
without
even
the
suggestion
of
a
palliative
anne
returned
to
castle
chute
and
preparations
were
soon
being
made
for
the
wedding
hardress
and
his
mother
went
to
stay
there
and
kyrle
daly
heard
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
won
the
girl
love
instead
of
pleading
his
cause
as
he
had
promised
the
anger
he
felt
was
diverted
by
a
family
tragedy
the
death
of
his
mother
at
her
wake
hardress
appeared
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
old
mihil
his
the
ropemaker
who
had
only
a
faint
recollection
of
having
met
him
before
told
him
of
his
because
of
eily
disappearance
and
misread
his
agitation
for
sympathy
some
while
afterwards
the
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
hunted
the
fox
and
the
dogs
found
on
the
bank
of
the
shannon
a
body
covered
with
a
large
blue
mantle
that
was
drenched
with
wet
and
mire
a
pair
of
small
feet
in
spanish
leather
shoes
appearing
from
below
the
end
of
the
garment
showed
that
the
body
was
that
of
a
female
whilst
a
mass
of
long
fair
hair
which
escaped
from
the
hood
proved
that
death
had
found
the
victim
untimely
in
her
youth
exiled
for
hardress
confided
the
mournful
story
to
his
mother
assuring
her
that
he
was
eily
murderer
after
the
first
extreme
agitation
the
lady
declared
that
he
overrated
the
measure
of
his
guilt
she
reproached
him
for
his
lack
of
confidence
after
all
the
love
she
had
showered
upon
him
he
clenched
his
hand
and
she
affected
to
fear
that
he
intended
to
strike
her
at
her
outcry
of
fear
he
sank
to
her
feet
lowering
his
forehead
to
the
very
dust
there
is
one
way
left
for
reparation
he
said
i
will
give
myself
up
there
is
peace
and
comfort
in
the
thought
he
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
anne
cregan
accounted
for
her
son
excitement
by
saying
that
he
was
later
in
the
evening
they
heard
that
the
coroner
had
not
even
found
anyone
to
identify
the
body
and
that
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
found
drowned
some
days
afterwards
hardress
went
shooting
to
the
creek
and
believing
that
he
had
killed
a
fled
back
to
the
house
the
fellow
however
was
unhurt
but
his
cries
attracted
the
attention
of
a
stranger
who
had
lain
concealed
under
a
bank
a
party
of
soldiers
appeared
now
and
fired
at
this
unknown
man
and
soon
he
staggered
and
was
taken
prisoner
cregan
came
to
hardress
room
with
fearful
tidings
eily
dress
had
been
recognised
and
suspicion
had
fallen
upon
danny
mann
hardress
told
her
that
his
former
servant
had
left
the
country
but
soon
the
soldiers
arrived
at
the
house
with
the
hunchback
in
charge
late
that
night
hardress
left
his
bed
and
entered
the
stable
where
danny
was
confined
the
hunchback
advanced
towards
him
slowly
his
hands
wreathed
together
his
jaw
dropped
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
offered
hardress
the
glove
i
had
my
token
surely
for
what
i
done
he
said
is
your
warrant
you
says
wor
them
your
words
but
not
for
death
replied
hardress
i
did
not
say
for
death
i
own
you
did
said
danny
mann
i
felt
for
you
an
i
wait
for
you
to
say
it
your
eye
looked
murder
as
sure
as
that
moon
is
shinin
so
sure
the
sign
of
death
was
on
your
face
that
time
whatever
way
your
words
went
hardress
gave
him
money
and
helped
him
to
escape
bidding
him
leave
the
country
if
ever
we
should
meet
again
on
irish
soil
he
said
it
must
be
the
death
of
either
the
exertions
for
danny
mann
recapture
proved
unavailing
and
in
a
few
weeks
the
affair
had
begun
to
grow
unfamiliar
to
the
tongues
and
recollections
of
the
people
hardress
depression
reached
an
unbearable
degree
and
anne
at
last
grew
seriously
uneasy
he
assured
her
that
if
she
knew
all
she
would
pity
and
not
blame
then
one
day
when
they
were
walking
together
they
came
upon
some
countryfolk
dancing
in
the
road
and
amongst
them
hardress
recognised
the
hunchback
he
caught
him
by
the
throat
and
flung
him
violently
against
the
wall
danny
mann
was
taken
into
custody
again
and
before
the
magistrate
told
of
hardress
complicity
in
the
crime
he
declared
that
he
had
always
loved
his
master
but
that
from
the
moment
of
the
assault
a
change
had
come
over
his
love
he
had
his
revenge
an
i
have
mine
he
said
he
does
feel
for
me
an
i
wo
feel
for
him
write
down
danny
mann
for
the
murderer
of
eily
an

down
hardress
cregan
for
his
adviser
he
produced
the
certificate
of
eily
marriage
i
took
it
out
of
her
bosom
after
he
shuddered
with
such
violence
that
the
door
trembled
she
kep
her
hand
in
her
bosom
upon
that
paper
to
the
last
gasp
as
if
she
thought
it
was
to
rob
her
of
that
i
wanted
the
magistrate
accompanied
by
a
guard
rode
to
castle
chute
it
was
the
wedding
evening
and
the
house
was
filled
with
gay
company
as
all
sat
at
table
together
hardress
heard
a
low
voice
whisper
in
his
ear
arise
and
fly
for
your
life
the
wineglass
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
became
filled
with
terror
once
again
he
heard
the
voice
arise
i
tell
you
the
army
is
abroad
and
your
life
is
in
danger
as
he
was
preparing
to
escape
his
mother
entered
his
presence
the
doors
are
all
defended
she
cried
there
is
a
soldier
set
on
every
entrance
you
are
trapped
and
caught
the
window
come
this
way
quick
quick
she
drew
him
passively
into
her
own
some
minutes
later
the
soldiers
forced
their
way
forward
and
found
him
concealed
in
an
inner
place
his
mother
sank
at
his
feet
and
cried
out
that
the
crime
was
hers
since
she
had
been
the
author
of
his
first
temptation
the
between
him
and
repentance
i
have
tied
the
cord
upon
your
throat
she
shrieked
i
have
been
your
fellest
foe
you
drank
in
pride
with
my
milk
and
passion
under
my
indulgence
hardress
took
the
wretched
woman
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
forehead
i
will
pray
for
you
at
the
moment
of
my
death
as
you
will
pray
for
me
he
said
then
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
soldiers
and
was
taken
away
at
the
trial
the
mercy
of
the
executive
power
was
extended
to
his
life
and
he
was
sentenced
to
perpetual
exile
as
the
convict
ship
which
was
to
bear
him
from
home
waited
in
the
river
he
was
brought
from
his
gaol
and
left
for
a
short
time
on
the
quay
where
he
heard
that
father
had
died
after
praying
for
and
forgiving
his
enemies
the
boat
arrived
to
convey
him
to
the
ship
and
whilst
descending
the
steps
he
was
overcome
by
a
seizure
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
the
aid
of
his
escort
the
dawn
of
the
following
morning
beheld
him
tossed
upon
the
waves
of
the
atlantic
and
looking
back
to
the
clifted
heads
of
the
shannon
that
stood
like
a
gigantic
portal
opening
far
behind
the
land
of
his
nativity
faded
rapidly
on
his
sight
but
before
the
vessel
came
in
sight
of
that
of
his
exile
he
had
rendered
up
the
life
which
the
law
forbore
to
take
danny
mann
died
amid
all
the
agonies
of
a
remorse
which

in
a
letter
written
by
my
sister
and
received
by
me
harry
burton
salesman
of
white
goods
bachelor
aged
just
as
i
was
trying
to
decide
where
i
should
spend
a
fortnight
vacation
she
suggested
as
i
was
always
complaining
of
never
having
time
to
read
i
should
stay
at
her
place
while
she
and
her
husband
went
on
a
fortnight
visit
she
owned
she
would
feel
easier
if
she
knew
there
was
a
man
in
the
house
just
the
thing
i
ejaculated
five
minutes
later
i
had
telegraphed
my
acceptance
and
had
mentally
selected
books
enough
for
a
dozen
vacations
i
knew
enough
of
helen
boys
to
be
sure
they
would
give
one
no
annoyance
budge
the
elder
was
five
years
of
age
and
had
generally
during
my
flying
visits
worn
a
shy
serious
meditative
noble
face
and
toddie
was
a
happy
little
of
three
summers
with
tangled
yellow
hair
three
days
later
i
hired
a
hackman
to
drive
me
from
hillcrest
station
half
a
mile
from
my
residence
the
horses
shied
violently
and
the
driver
after
talking
freely
to
them
remarked
that
was
one
of
the
imps
as
he
spoke
the
offending
youth
came
panting
beside
our
carriage
and
in
a
very
dirty
i
recognised
my
nephew
budge
then
a
smaller
boy
emerged
from
the
bushes
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
i
beheld
the
unmistakable
lineaments
of
toddie
they
my
nephews
i
gasped
budge
i
said
with
all
the
sternness
i
could
command
do
you
know
me
yes
you
uncle
harry
did
you
bring
us
anything
i
wish
i
could
have
brought
you
some
big
whippings
for
behaving
so
badly
get
into
this
carriage
as
they
clambered
up
i
noticed
that
each
one
carried
a
very
dirty
towel
knotted
tightly
in
the
centre
after
some
moments
disgusted
contemplation
of
these
rags
i
asked
budge
what
these
towels
were
for
they
not
towels
they
dollies
promptly
answered
my
nephew
goodness
i
exclaimed
i
should
think
your
mother
might
buy
you
respectable
dolls
and
not
let
you
appear
in
public
with
these
loathsome
rags
we
do
like
buyed
dollies
said
budge
these
dollies
is
lovely
mine
got
blue
eyes
and
toddie
has
got
brown
eyes
i
want
to
shee
your
watch
remarked
toddie
snatching
the
chain
and
rolling
into
my
lap
so
do
i
shouted
budge
hastening
to
occupy
one
knee
and
in
transit
wiping
his
shoes
on
my
trousers
and
the
skirts
of
my
coat
a
carriage
containing
a
couple
of
ladies
was
rapidly
approaching
i
dropped
my
head
to
avoid
meeting
their
glance
for
my
few
minutes
of
contact
with
my
dreadful
nephews
had
made
me
feel
inexpressibly
the
carriage
stopped
i
heard
my
own
name
spoken
there
erect
fresh
neat
smiling
and
observant
sat
miss
alice
mayton
a
lady
who
for
about
a
year
i
had
been
adoring
from
afar
when
did
you
arrive
mr
burton
she
asked
you
certainly
a
trio
so
unconventional
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
having
a
good
time
i
i
assure
you
miss
mayton
that
my
experience
has
been
the
reverse
of
a
pleasant
one
if
king
herod
were
yet
alive
i
volunteer
as
an
executioner
you
dreadful
wretch
exclaimed
the
lady
mother
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
burton
helen
lawrence
brother
how
is
your
sister
mr
burton
i
do
know
i
replied
she
gone
with
her
husband
on
a
visit
and
i
been
silly
enough
to
promise
to
give
an
eye
to
the
place
while
they
away
why
how
delightful
said
miss
mayton
such
horses
such
flowers
such
a
cook
and
such
children
said
i
glaring
at
the
imps
and
rescuing
my
handkerchief
from
toddie
why
they
the
best
children
in
the
world
helen
told
me
so
children
will
be
children
you
know
i
do
wish
to
give
any
hints
but
at
clarkson
where
we
boarding
there
not
a
flower
in
the
whole
garden
i
break
the
tenth
commandment
every
time
i
pass
colonel
lawrence
of
course
you
call
said
miss
mayton
as
the
carriage
started
it
dreadfully
stupid
here
no
men
except
on
sundays
i
bowed
assent
in
the
contemplation
of
all
the
shy
possibilities
my
short
chat
with
miss
mayton
had
suggested
i
had
quite
forgotten
my
dusty
clothing
and
the
two
little
living
causes
thereof
the
fate
of
a
next
morning
at
breakfast
toddie
remarked
ocken
hawwy
darsh
an
awfoo
funny
chunt
upstairs
i
show
it
to
you
after
brepspup
toddie
a
silly
little
boy
said
budge
he
always
says
brepspup
for
brekbux
oh
what
does
he
mean
by
chunt
budge
i
guess
he
means
trunk
replied
my
elder
nephew
recollections
of
my
childish
delight
in
rummaging
an
old
trunk
caused
me
to
smile
sympathetically
at
toddie
to
his
great
delight
a
direful
thought
struck
me
i
dashed
upstairs
yes
he
did
mean
my
trunk
while
a
campaigner
i
had
learned
to
reduce
packing
to
an
exact
science
now
if
i
had
an
atom
of
pride
in
me
i
might
have
glorified
myself
for
it
certainly
seemed
as
if
the
heap
upon
the
floor
could
never
have
come
out
of
one
single
trunk
in
the
lid
of
my
lay
my
tightly
rolled
up
snatching
it
up
with
a
violent
exclamation
there
dropped
from
it
one
of
these
infernal
dolls
a
howl
resounded
from
the
doorway
you
tookted
my
dolly
out
of
her
want
to
wock
my
dolly
ee
i
called
the
girl
and
asked
where
the
key
was
that
locked
the
door
between
my
room
and
the
children
please
sir
toddie
threw
it
down
the
well
i
removed
the
lock
and
told
the
coachman
to
get
ready
at
once
to
drive
to
paterson
where
the
nearest
locksmith
lived
by
the
hill
road
one
of
the
most
beautiful
roads
in
america
away
went
the
horses
and
up
rose
a
piercing
shriek
and
a
terrible
roar
i
looked
out
hastily
only
to
see
budge
and
toddie
running
after
the
carriage
and
crying
pitifully
the
driver
stopped
of
his
own
accord
he
seemed
to
know
the
children
ways
and
their
results
and
i
helped
them
in
meekly
hoping
the
eye
of
providence
was
upon
me
that
afternoon
i
devoted
myself
to
making
a
bouquet
for
miss
mayton
and
a
most
delightful
occupation
i
found
it
not
that
i
was
in
love
with
miss
mayton
a
man
may
honestly
and
strongly
admire
a
handsome
brilliant
woman
and
delight
himself
in
trying
to
give
her
pleasure
without
feeling
it
necessary
she
shall
give
him
herself
in
return
my
delight
suddenly
became
clouded
what
would
folks
say
everybody
knew
where
mike
was
employed
everybody
knew
i
was
the
only
gentleman
at
present
residing
at
colonel
lawrence
ah
i
had
it
i
had
seen
in
one
of
the
library
drawers
a
pasteboard
box
just
the
size
i
dropped
my
card
into
the
bottom
neatly
fitted
in
the
bouquet
and
went
in
search
of
mike
he
winked
cheeringly
and
said
he
would
do
it
as
clane
as
a
whistle
divil
a
man
can
see
but
the
angels
and
they
wo
tell
very
well
mike
here
a
dollar
for
you
you
find
the
box
on
the
in
the
hall
with
a
head
full
of
pleasing
fancies
i
went
down
to
supper
and
found
my
new
friends
unusually
good
their
ride
seemed
to
have
toned
down
their
boisterousness
and
elevated
their
little
souls
so
when
they
invited
me
to
put
them
to
bed
i
gladly
accepted
toddie
disappeared
somewhere
and
came
back
disconsolate
ca
find
my
doll
he
whined
never
mind
old
pet
said
i
soothingly

his
foot

dolly
in
it
and
i
want
to
shee
her
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
a
story
for
a
moment
toddle
face
indicated
a
terrible
internal
conflict
between
old
adam
and
mother
eve
finally
curiosity
overpowered
natural
depravity
and
toddie
muttered
yesh
very
soon
a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
me
come
in
i
shouted
in
stepped
mike
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
secrecy
handed
me
a
letter
and
box
what
could
it
mean
i
hastily
opened
the
envelope
while
toddie
shrieked
oh
darsh
my
dolly
dare
tizh
snatched
and
opened
the
box
and
displayed
his
doll
my
heart
sickened
as
i
read
miss
mayton
herewith
returns
to
burton
the
package
which
has
just
arrived
with
his
card
she
recognises
the
contents
as
a
portion
of
the
property
of
one
of
burton
nephews
but
is
unable
to
understand
why
it
should
have
been
sent
to
her
toddie
i
roared
as
my
younger
nephew
caressed
his
loathsome
doll
where
did
you
get
that
box
on
the
he
replied
with
perfect
fearlessness
i
keeps
it
in
ze
bookcase
djawer
and
somebody
took
it
an
put
nasty
ole
flowers
in
it
where

demanded

considerable
surprise
but
promptly
replied
i
froed
away
do
want
no
ole
flowers
in
my
dolly
ze
way
she
wocks
see
and
this
horrible
little
destroyer
of
human
hopes
rolled
that
box
back
and
forth
with
the
most
utter
unconcern
of
language
to
express
my
feeling
to
toddie
i
could
find
absolutely
none
within
these
few
minutes
i
had
discovered
how
very
anxious
i
really
was
to
merit
miss
mayton
regard
and
how
very
different
was
the
regard
i
wanted
from
that
which
i
had
previously
hoped
might
be
accorded
to
me
under
my
stern
glance
toddie
gradually
lost
interest
in
his
doll
and
began
to
thrust
forth
his
piteous
lower
lip
and
to
weep
copiously
dee
lord
not
make
me
sho
bad
he
even
retired
to
a
corner
and
hid
his
face
in
penance
never
mind
toddie
said
i
sadly
you
did
mean
to
do
it
i
know
i
wantsh
to
love
you
sobbed
toddie
well
come
here
you
poor
little
fellow
toddie
came
to
my
arms
shed
tears
freely
upon
my
and
finally
remarked
wantsh
you
to
love
me
i
kissed
toddie
and
petted
him
and
at
length
succeeded
in
quieting
him
he
looked
earnestly
confidingly
in
my
eyes
and
then
said
kish
my
dolly
too
i
obeyed
my
forgiveness
was
complete
and
so
was
my
humiliation
i
withdrew
abruptly
to
write
an
apology
budge
the
on
monday
morning
i
devoted
myself
to
toddie
expiatory
bouquet
in
which
i
had
the
benefit
of
my
nephews
assistance
and
counsel
and
took
enforced
part
in
the
conversation
at
two
i
instructed
maggie
to
dress
my
nephews
and
at
three
we
started
to
make
our
call
as
we
approached
i
saw
miss
mayton
on
the
piazza
handing
the
bouquet
to
toddie
we
entered
the
garden
when
he
shrieked
oh
there
a
and
with
the
carelessness
born
of
perfect
ecstasy
dropped
the
bouquet
i
snatched
it
before
it
reached
the
ground
dragged
him
up
to
miss
mayton
and
told
him
to
give
the
bouquet
to
the
lady
as
she
stooped
to
kiss
him
he
wriggled
off
like
a
little
eel
shouted
tum
on
to
his
brother
and
a
moment
later
both
were
following
the
at
a
respectful
distance
bless
the
little
darlings
said
miss
mayton
i
do
love
to
see
children
enjoying
themselves
we
settled
down
to
a
pleasant
chat
about
books
pictures
music
and
the
gossip
of
our
set
handsome
intelligent
composed
tastefully
dressed
she
awakened
to
the
uttermost
every
admiring
sentiment
and
every
manly
feeling
when
i
began
to
take
leave
miss
mayton
mother
insisted
that
we
should
stay
to
dinner
for
myself
i
should
be
delighted
mayton
said
i
but
my
nephews
have
hardly
learned
company
manners
yet
oh
i
take
care
of
the
little
dears
said
miss
mayton
they
be
good
with
me
i
know
she
insisted
and
the
pleasure
of
submitting
to
her
will
was
so
great
that
i
would
have
risked
even
greater
mischief
the
soup
was
served
and
toddie
immediately
tilted
his
plate
so
that
part
of
its
contents
sought
refuge
in
the
folds
of
miss
mayton
dainty
snowy
dress
she
treated
that
wretched
boy
with
the
most
christian
forbearance
during
the
rest
of
the
meal
when
the
dessert
was
finished
she
quickly
excused
herself
and
i
removed
toddie
to
a
secluded
corner
and
favoured
him
with
a
lecture
which
caused
him
to
howl
pitifully
and
compelled
me
to
caress
him
and
undo
all
the
good
i
had
done
i
awaited
miss
mayton
reappearance
to
offer
an
apology
for
toddie
and
to
make
my
adieus
the
other
ladies
departed
in
twos
and
threes
and
left
us
without
witnesses
suddenly
she
appeared
and
whatever
was
the
cause
she
looked
queenly
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
the
boys
retired
to
the
end
of
the
piazza
to
make
experiments
on
a
large
newfoundland
dog
while
i
the
happiest
man
alive
talked
to
the
glorious
woman
before
me
and
enjoyed
her
radiant
beauty
the
twilight
came
and
deepened
and
our
voices
unconsciously
dropped
to
lower
tones
and
her
voice
seemed
purest
music
suddenly
a
small
shadow
came
between
and
the
voice
of
budge
remarked
uncle
harry
you
miss
mayton
suspects
me
of
what
pray
exclaimed
the
lady
patting
my
cheek
budge
said
i
i
felt
my
voice
rising
nearly
to
a
scream
budge
i
must
beg
you
to
respect
the
sanctity
of
confidential
communications
what
is
it
budge
persisted
miss
mayton
you
know
the
old
adage
burton
and
fools
speak
the
truth
of
what
does
he
suspect
me
budge
at
all
said
budge
it
espect
expect
echoed
miss
mayton
respect
is
what
the
boy
is
trying
to
say
miss
mayton
i
interrupted
budge
has
a
terrifying
faculty
for
asking
questions
and
the
result
of
some
of
them
this
morning
was
my
endeavour
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
respect
in
which
gentlemen
hold
ladies
yes
said
budge
i
know
all
about
it
only
uncle
harry
do
say
it
right
what
he
calls
respect
calls
miss
mayton
i
said
hastily
earnestly
budge
is
a
marplot
but
he
is
a
very
truthful
interpreter
for
all
that
whatever
my
fate
may
be
do
not
i
want
to
talk
some
observed
budge
you
talk
all
the
whole
time
i
when
i
loves
anybody
i
kisses
them
miss
mayton
gave
a
little
start
and
my
thoughts
followed
each
other
with
unimagined
rapidity
she
was
not
angry
evidently
could
it
be
that
i
bent
over
her
and
acted
on
budge
suggestion
she
raised
her
head
slightly
and
i
saw
that
alice
mayton
had
surrendered
at
discretion
taking
her
hand
i
offered
to
the
lord
more
fervent
thanks
than
he
had
ever
heard
from
me
in
church
then
budge
said
i
wants
to
kiss
you
too
and
i
saw
my
glorious
alice
snatch
the
little
scamp
into
her
arms
and
treat
him
with
more
affection
than
i
had
ever
imagined
was
in
her

clearly
that

nephews

i
begged

of
my
a
few

mournfully

an
oh

said
budge
in
a
perfect
delirium
of
delight
i
believe
if

papa

stayed
away
any
longer
i
believe
i

so
lonesome

i
have
known

i
cried
whole
pillowsful
about

try
to
comfort

could
said
budge
when

gets
lonesome
it
feels
as
if
my
mouth
was
all
tied
up
and
a
big
great
stone
was
right
in
here
and
budge
put
his
hand
on
his
chest
if
a
big
tone
wash
inshide
of
me

toddie
i
take

i
said

coming
yesh
said
toddie
mamma
always
bwings
me
candy
fen
she
goes
anyfere
during
the
hour
which
passed
before
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
depot
my
sole
attention
was
devoted
to
keeping
the
children
from
soiling
their
clothes
but
my
success
was
so
little
i
lost
my
temper
utterly
harness
the
horse
mike
i
shouted
an
the
goat
too
added
budge
five
minutes
later
i
was
seated
in
the
carriage
are
you
all
ready
boys
i
asked
in
a
minute
said
budge
soon
as
i
fix
this
now
he
continued
getting
into
his
seat
and
seizing
the
reins
and
whip
go
ahead
wait
a
minute
budge
put
down
that
whip
and
do
touch
the
goat
with
it
once
i
going
to
drive
very
slowly
all
you
need
do
is
to
hold
the
reins
all
right
said
budge
but
i
like
to
look
like
mans
when
i
drive
the
horses
went
at
a
gentle
trot
and
the
goat
followed
very
closely
when
within
a
minute
of
the
depot
the
train
swept
in
i
gave
the
horses
the
whip
looked
and
saw
the
boys
close
behind
me
nothing
but
the
sharpest
of
turns
saved
me
from
a
severe
accident
as
it
was
i
heard
two
hard
thumps
upon
the
wooden
wall
and
two
frightful
howls
and
saw
both
my
nephews
mixed
up
on
the
platform
while
the
driver
of
the
stage
growled
in
my
ear
what
in
thunder
did
you
let
hitch
that
goat
to
your
axletree
for
how
the
goat
head
and
shoulders
maintained
their
normal
connection
during
the
last
minute
of
my
drive
i
leave
naturalists
to
explain
fortunately
the
children
had
struck
on
their
heads
and
the
burton
skull
is
a
marvel
of
solidity
i
set
them
on
their
feet
promised
them
all
the
candy
they
could
eat
for
a
week
and
hurried
them
to
the
other
side
of
the
depot
budge
rushed
at
tom
exclaiming
see
my
goat
papa
helen
was
somewhat
concerned
about
the
children
but
found
time
to
look
at
me
with
so
much
of
sympathy
humour
affection
and
condescension
that
i
really
felt
relieved
when
we
reached
the
house
and
how
gloriously
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
off
we
had
a
delightful
little
lunch
and
tom
brought
up
a
bottle
of
roederer
and
we
drank
to
her
and
her
mother
then
helen
proposed
the
makers
of
the
match
budge
and
toddie
which
was
honoured
with
bumpers
the
gentlemen
toasted
did
not
respond
but
stared
so
curiously
i
sprang
from
my
chair
and
kissed
them
soundly
while
helen
and
tom
exchanged
significant
glances
young
as
they
are
i
find
frequent
reason
to
be
jealous
of
them
but
artifice
alone
can
prevent
them
monopolising
the
time
of
an
adorable
being
of
whose
society
i
can
not
possibly
have
too
much
she
insists
that
when
the
ceremony
takes
place
in
december
they
shall
officiate
as
groomsmen
and
i
have
no
doubt
she
will
carry
her
point
in
fact
when
i
retire
for
the
night
without
first
seeking
their
room
and
putting
a
grateful
kiss
on
their
unconscious
lips
my
conscience
upbraids
me
with
base
ingratitude
to
think
i
might
yet
be
a
hopeless
bachelor
had
it
not
been
for
them
is
to
overflow
with
gratitude
to
the
giver
of
babies
ludovic
halevy
the
abbé
constantin
ludovic
halevy
born
in
paris
on
january
was
a
nephew
of
jacques
françois
halevy
the
famous
operatic
composer
beginning
life
in
the
civil
service
he
himself
achieved
considerable
distinction
as
a
dramatic
author
written
in
collaboration
with
meilhac
being
one
of
the
greatest
theatrical
successes
of
his
century
he
soon
however
forsook
the
drama
for
fiction
his
first
novel
monsieur
and
madame
cardinal
published
in
gave
ample
promise
of
the
inventive
genius
and
gift
of
characterisation
that
were
fully
realised
nine
years
later
in
constantin
the
tale
an
exquisite
study
of
french
provincial
life
came
as
a
distinct
revelation
of
french
life
and
character
to
english
readers
it
has
reached
editions
and
has
been
translated
into
all
european
languages
in
halevy
was
elected
to
the
french
academy
he
died
on
may
the
good
days
are
gone
with
footstep
firm
and
strong
despite
his
weight
of
years
an
old
priest
was
walking
along
a
dusty
country
road
one
sunny
day
in
may
it
was
more
than
thirty
years
since
the
abbé
constantin
had
first
become
of
the
little
village
sleeping
there
in
the
sunny
plain
of
france
beside
a
dainty
stream
called
the
lizotte
he
had
been
walking
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
along
the
wall
of
the
château
de
longueval
as
he
reached
the
massive
entrance
gates
he
stopped
and
gazed
sadly
at
two
immense
bills
pasted
on
the
pillars
they
announced
the
sale
by
auction
that
day
of
the
longueval
estate
divided
into
four
lots
the
castle
with
all
its
grounds
and
parks
the
farm
of
acres
the
farm
of
rozeraie
acres
the
forest
and
woods
of
mionne
acres
the
reserve
prices
totalled
the
respectable
sum
of
francs
so
that
magnificent
estate
which
for
two
centuries
had
passed
intact
from
father
to
son
in
the
longueval
family
was
to
be
divided
the
bills
announced
it
was
true
that
after
the
preliminary
sale
of
the
four
lots
the
highest
bidder
might
bid
for
the
whole
estate
but
it
was
an
enormous
sum
and
no
purchaser
was
likely
to
present
himself
the
marquise
de
longueval
dying
six
months
since
had
left
three
heirs
her
grandchildren
two
of
whom
were
under
age
so
that
the
estate
had
to
be
put
up
for
sale
pierre
the
eldest
an
extravagant
young
man
of
had
foolishly
squandered
half
his
money
and
was
quite
unable
to
longueval
it
was
twelve
in
an
hour
the
château
would
have
a
new
master
who
would
he
be
who
could
take
the
place
of
the
marquise
the
old
friend
of
the
country
curé
and
the
kindly
friend
of
all
the
villagers
the
old
priest
walked
on
thinking
sadly
of
the
habits
of
thirty
years
suddenly
interrupted
every
thursday
and
every
sunday
he
had
dined
at
the
château
how
much
had
they
made
of
him
curé
of
longueval
all
his
life
he
had
been
that
had
dreamed
of
nothing
else
he
loved
his
little
church
the
little
village
and
his
little
vicarage
still
in
pensive
mood
he
was
passing
the
park
of
lavardens
when
he
heard
some
one
calling
him
looking
up
he
saw
the
countess
of
lavardens
and
her
son
paul
she
was
a
widow
her
son
a
handsome
young
man
who
had
made
a
bad
start
in
the
world
and
now
contented
himself
by
spending
some
months
in
paris
every
year
when
he
dissipated
the
annual
allowance
from
his
mother
and
returned
home
for
the
rest
of
the
year
to
loaf
about
in
idleness
or
in
pursuit
of
stupid
sports
where
are
you
off
to
monsieur
le
curé
asked
the
countess
to
souvigny
to
learn
the
result
of
the
sale
stay
here
with
us
de
larnac
is
there
and
will
hasten
back
with
the
news
but
i
can
tell
you
who
are
the
new
owners
of
the
castle
at
this
the
abbé
turned
into
the
gates
of
the
countess
grounds
and
joined
that
lady
and
her
son
on
the
terrace
of
their
house
the
new
owners
it
appeared
were
to
be
de
larnac
gallard
a
rich
paris
banker
and
the
countess
herself
for
the
three
had
agreed
to
purchase
it
between
them
it
is
all
settled
the
lady
assured
him
but
presently
de
larnac
arrived
with
the
news
that
they
had
been
unable
to
buy
it
as
some
american
had
paid
an
enormous
sum
for
the
entire
estate
the
person
who
was
now
to
be
the
great
lady
of
longueval
was
named
madame
scott
de
larnac
had
some
further
particulars
to
add
he
had
heard
that
the
scotts
were
great
upstarts
and
that
the
new
owner
of
the
castle
had
actually
been
a
beggar
in
new
york
a
great
lawsuit
had
resulted
in
favour
of
her
and
her
husband
making
them
the
owners
of
a
and
we
are
to
have
such
people
for
neighbours
exclaimed
the
countess
an
adventuress
and
no
doubt
a
protestant
monsieur
le
curé
the
abbé
was
very
sore
at
heart
and
never
doubting
but
that
the
new
mistress
of
the
castle
would
be
no
friend
of
his
he
took
his
way
homeward
in
his
imagination
he
saw
this
madame
scott
settled
at
the
castle
and
despising
his
little
catholic
church
and
all
his
simple
services
to
the
quiet
village
folk
he
was
still
brooding
over
the
unhappy
fate
of
longueval
when
his
godson
jean
reynaud
son
of
his
old
friend
reynaud
to
whom
he
had
been
as
good
as
a
father
and
who
was
worthy
of
the
old
priest
love
dismounted
at
his
door
for
jean
was
now
a
lieutenant
in
the
artillery
stationed
in
the
district
and
much
of
his
leisure
was
spent
at
the
abbé
house
jean
tried
to
console
him
by
saying
that
even
though
this
american
madame
scott
were
not
a
catholic
she
was
known
to
be
generous
and
would
no
doubt
give
him
money
for
the
poor
the
new
the
abbé
and
his
godson
were
in
the
garden
next
day
when
they
heard
a
carriage
stop
at
the
gate
two
ladies
alighted
dressed
in
simple
travelling
costumes
they
came
into
the
garden
and
the
elder
of
the
two
who
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
came
up
to
the
abbé
constantin
saying
with
only
the
slightest
foreign
accent
i
am
obliged
to
introduce
myself
le
curé
i
am
madame
scott
in
whose
name
yesterday
the
castle
and
estate
were
bought
and
if
it
is
no
inconvenience
i
should
be
glad
to
take
five
minutes
of
your
time
then
turning
to
her
companion
she
said
this
is
my
sister
miss
bettina
percival
as
you
may
have
guessed
greatly
agitated
the
abbé
bowed
his
respects
and
led
into
his
little
vicarage
the
new
mistress
of
longueval
and
her
sister
the
cloth
had
been
laid
for
the
simple
meal
of
the
old
priest
and
the
lieutenant
and
the
ladies
seemed
charmed
with
the
humble
comfort
of
the
place
look
now
susie
said
miss
bettina
is
this
just
the
sort
of
vicarage
you
hoped
it
would
be
and
the
abbé
also
if
he
will
allow
me
to
say
so
said
madame
scott
for
what
did
i
say
in
the
train
this
morning
bettina
and
only
a
little
while
ago
in
the
carriage
my
sister
said
to
me
le
curé
said
miss
percival
that
she
desired
above
all
things
that
the
abbé
should
not
be
young
nor
melancholy
nor
severe
but
that
he
should
be
and
gentle
and
good
and
that
is
you
exactly
le
curé
said
madame
scott
brightly
i
find
you
just
as
i
had
hoped
and
i
trust
you
may
be
as
well
pleased
with
your
new
parishioners
parishioners
exclaimed
the
abbé
but
then
you
are
catholics
certainly
we
are
catholics
and
noting
the
surprise
of
the
old
abbé
she
went
on
to
say
ah
i
understand
our
name
and
our
country
made
you
expect
we
should
be
protestants
and
unfriendly
to
you
and
your
people
but
our
mother
was
a
canadian
and
a
catholic
of
french
origin
and
that
is
why
my
sister
and
i
speak
french
with
just
a
little
foreign
accent
my
husband
is
a
protestant
but
he
leaves
me
full
liberty
and
so
my
two
children
are
being
educated
in
my
own
faith
and
that
is
why
we
have
come
to
see
you
the
first
day
we
have
arrived
the
good
old
priest
was
overwhelmed
by
the
news
but
his
joy
almost
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
when
the
ladies
each
presented
him
with
a
thousand
francs
and
promised
five
hundred
francs
a
month
for
the
poor
he
had
never
handled
so
much
money
in
all
his
life
before
why
there
will
be
no
poor
left
in
all
the
district
he
stammered
and
we
should
be
glad
if
that
were
so
said
madame
scott
for
we
have
plenty
and
we
could
not
do
better
with
it
then
followed
the
happiest
little
dinner
party
that
had
ever
taken
place
beneath
the
abbé
roof
madame
scott
explained
how
her
husband
had
bought
the
château
as
a
surprise
for
her
and
that
neither
she
nor
her
sister
had
seen
it
until
that
morning
now
tell
me
she
suggested
what
they
said
about
the
new
owner
the
old
priest
blushed
and
was
at
a
loss
to
answer
well
you
are
a
soldier
she
continued
turning
to
lieutenant
reynaud
and
you
will
tell
me
did
they
say
that
i
had
been
a
beggar
yes
i
heard
that
said
and
that
i
had
been
a
performer
in
a
travelling
circus
that
also
i
heard
said
he
admitted
i
thank
you
for
your
frankness
and
now
let
me
tell
you
that
while
i
can
see
nothing
in
either
case
that
would
be
any
disgrace
to
me
the
story
does
not
happen
to
be
true
i
have
known
what
it
is
to
be
poor
for
my
parents
died
eight
years
ago
leaving
us
only
a
great
lawsuit
but
my
father
last
wish
was
that
we
should
fight
it
to
the
end
with
the
aid
of
the
son
of
one
of
his
old
friends
now
my
husband
we
fought
and
won
that
is
how
i
came
into
my
fortune
the
stories
you
have
heard
were
invented
by
spiteful
paris
journalists
after
the
ladies
had
taken
their
departure
for
paris
the
abbé
constantin
was
as
happy
as
he
had
so
lately
been
miserable
and
as
for
lieutenant
reynaud
the
vision
of
their
fresh
and
charming
faces
was
with
him
all
through
the
military
manoeuvres
in
which
he
was
now
engaged
but
as
both
of
them
were
equally
charming
in
his
mind
he
concluded
he
could
not
have
fallen
in
love
or
he
would
have
known
which
he
admired
the
more
he
did
not
know
how
many
were
the
suitors
in
paris
for
miss
bettina
and
possibly
if
he
had
seen
the
sisters
among
the
fashionable
people
of
that
gay
city
he
would
never
have
given
them
a
second
thought
for
he
was
a
true
son
of
the
country
this
healthy
and
manly
young
officer
whose
tastes
were
as
simple
as
the
surroundings
in
which
he
had
grown
up
demanded
miss
bettina
indeed
had
only
to
say
the
word
and
she
might
have
been
the
princess
romanelli
and
i
should
like
to
be
a
princess
for
the
name
sounds
well
she
said
to
herself
oh
if
i
only
loved
him
there
were
many
men
of
rank
and
title
who
would
have
been
glad
to
have
married
the
wealthy
young
american
lady
but
she
found
herself
in
love
with
none
of
them
and
now
she
was
looking
forward
to
the
fourteenth
of
june
when
she
and
her
sister
were
to
leave
paris
for
longueval
during
their
stay
at
the
castle
they
were
to
entertain
many
friends
but
for
ten
days
they
were
to
be
free
to
roam
the
woods
and
fields
and
forget
the
distractions
of
their
fashionable
life
in
the
capital
but
you
forget
said
madame
scott
on
their
way
to
longueval
that
we
are
to
have
two
people
to
dinner
ah
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
welcome
both
of
them
particularly
the
young
lieutenant
bettina
confessed
with
a
touch
of
shyness
friendship
great
alterations
had
been
made
at
the
castle
during
the
month
that
had
elapsed
the
rooms
had
been
refurnished
the
stables
and
were
stocked
the
made
trim
and
beautiful
and
servants
were
busy
everywhere
when
the
abbé
and
jean
arrived
they
were
ushered
in
by
two
tall
and
dignified
footmen
but
madame
scott
received
them
with
all
the
frankness
she
had
shown
at
the
vicarage
and
presented
her
son
harry
and
her
daughter
bella
who
were
six
and
five
years
old
then
miss
percival
joined
them
and
presently
they
were
all
talking
together
like
old
friends
but
the
happiest
of
all
was
abbé
constantin
he
felt
at
home
again
too
much
at
home
and
when
coffee
was
served
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
château
after
dinner
he
lost
himself
in
an
agreeable
reverie
then
terrible
catastrophe
he
fell
into
his
old
habit
and
sank
into
an
after
dinner
doze
as
he
had
so
often
done
in
the
days
of
the
marquise
jean
and
bettina
found
much
to
say
to
each
other
and
as
the
ladies
were
looking
forward
to
riding
round
the
estates
jean
who
rode
every
day
for
exercise
promised
to
join
them
it
was
quite
clear
that
miss
bettina
was
glad
to
see
them
both
particularly
the
young
lieutenant
and
when
madame
scott
and
her
sister
walked
up
the
avenue
after
having
accompanied
jean
and
the
abbé
to
the
gate
bettina
confessed
that
she
expected
to
be
scolded
for
being
so
friendly
with
jean
but
i
shall
not
scold
you
madame
scott
said
for
he
has
made
a
favourable
impression
on
me
from
the
first
he
inspires
me
with
confidence
that
is
just
how
i
feel
towards
him
said
bettina
quietly
as
for
jean
he
talked
so
much
to
paul
about
his
visit
that
that
gay
young
man
accused
him
of
having
fallen
in
love
but
of
course
that
was
mere
nonsense
there
was
no
fear
of
jean
falling
in
love
for
a
poor
lieutenant
could
never
dream
of
winning
an
heiress
for
his
wife
when
next
he
met
bettina
they
had
a
very
long
talk
about
their
people
and
it
appeared
that
they
were
both
descendants
of
french
peasants
that
was
why
jean
loved
the
country
folk
around
longueval
and
when
he
had
served
his
time
in
the
army
he
thought
he
would
retire
on
an
old
colonel
perhaps
and
come
back
to
live
there
always
quite
alone
asked
bettina
why
i
hope
not
oh
then
you
intend
to
marry
well
one
may
think
of
that
though
one
need
not
always
be
seeking
to
marry
yet
there
are
some
who
look
for
it
i
know
and
i
have
heard
that
you
might
have
married
more
than
one
girl
with
a
handsome
fortune
if
you
had
wished
and
how
do
you
know
that
asked
jean
monsieur
le
curé
told
me
i
soon
found
that
nothing
makes
your
godfather
happier
than
to
talk
of
you
and
in
our
morning
walks
he
tells
me
your
history
tell
me
why
you
refused
these
good
marriages
simply
because
i
thought
it
better
not
to
marry
at
all
than
to
marry
without
love
was
jean
frank
avowal
i
think
so
too
said
bettina
she
looked
at
him
he
looked
at
her
and
suddenly
to
the
great
surprise
of
both
they
found
nothing
more
to
say
fortunately
at
this
moment
harry
and
bella
burst
into
the
room
with
an
invitation
to
see
their
ponies
bettina
three
weeks
during
which
longueval
has
been
crowded
with
visitors
have
passed
and
the
time
has
come
for
jean
to
take
the
road
for
the
annual
artillery
practice
he
will
be
away
for
twenty
days
and
while
he
wishes
to
be
off
he
wonders
how
those
twenty
days
will
pass
without
a
sight
of
bettina
for
now
he
frankly
adores
her
he
is
happy
and
he
is
miserable
he
knows
by
every
action
and
every
word
that
she
loves
him
as
truly
as
he
loves
her
but
he
feels
it
his
duty
to
fight
against
his
own
heart
wish
lest
the
penniless
lieutenant
might
be
thought
to
covet
the
riches
of
the
young
heiress
but
he
could
not
drag
himself
away
without
one
last
meeting
yet
when
he
saw
how
anxious
bettina
was
to
please
him
and
make
him
happy
with
her
friendship
he
was
afraid
to
hold
her
in
his
arms
lest
he
might
be
tempted
to
tell
her
how
full
his
heart
was
with
love
for
her
she
excused
herself
to
paul
de
lavardens
so
that
she
might
give
his
dance
to
jean
but
jean
declined
the
favour
on
the
plea
that
he
was
not
feeling
well
and
to
save
himself
he
hastened
off
without
even
shaking
her
hand
but
all
this
only
told
his
secret
the
more
clearly
to
the
heart
that
loved
him
i
love
him
dear
susie
said
bettina
that
night
and
i
know
that
he
loves
me
for
myself
not
for
the
money
i
possess
you
are
sure
my
dear
yes
for
he
will
not
speak
he
tries
to
avoid
me
my
horrid
money
which
attracts
others
to
me
is
the
thing
that
keeps
him
from
declaring
his
love
be
very
sure
my
dear
for
you
know
you
might
have
been
a
marchioness
or
a
princess
if
you
had
wished
you
are
sure
you
will
not
mind
being
plain
madame
reynaud
absolutely
for
i
love
him
now
let
me
make
a
proposal
bettina
went
on
jean
is
going
away
i
shall
not
see
him
for
three
weeks
and
that
will
be
time
to
know
my
own
mind
in
three
weeks
may
i
go
and
ask
him
myself
if
he
will
have
me
for
his
wife
tell
me
susie
may
i
of
course
her
sister
could
but
consent
and
bettina
was
happy
next
morning
she
had
a
wild
desire
to
wave
jean
a
in
the
pouring
rain
she
made
her
way
through
the
woods
to
the
terrace
by
the
road
her
dress
torn
by
the
thorns
and
her
umbrella
lost
to
wave
to
him
as
he
passed
saying
to
herself
that
this
would
show
him
how
dear
he
was
in
her
thoughts
scott
had
come
from
paris
before
jean
was
back
and
he
too
approved
of
bettina
plan
for
they
wished
her
to
marry
only
one
she
truly
loved
but
when
the
lieutenant
came
back
with
his
regiment
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
avoid
meeting
bettina
and
had
even
decided
to
exchange
into
another
regiment
he
refused
an
invitation
to
the
château
but
the
good
abbé
begged
of
him
not
to
leave
the
district
wait
a
little
until
the
good
god
calls
me
do
not
go
now
jean
urged
that
honour
made
it
clear
to
him
he
should
go
away
the
abbé
told
him
that
he
was
quite
sure
bettina
heart
was
all
for
him
as
truly
as
he
believed
jean
love
was
all
for
her
her
money
jean
confessed
was
the
great
drawback
as
it
might
make
others
think
lightly
of
his
love
for
her
besides
he
was
a
soldier
and
he
could
not
condemn
her
to
the
life
of
a
soldier
wife
the
abbé
was
still
trying
to
convince
his
godson
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
old
man
opening
the
door
admitted
bettina
she
went
straight
to
jean
and
took
him
by
both
hands
saying
i
must
go
to
him
first
for
less
than
three
weeks
ago
he
was
suffering
the
young
lieutenant
stood
speechless
and
now
to
you
le
curé
let
me
confess
but
do
not
go
away
jean
for
it
is
a
public
confession
what
i
have
to
say
i
would
have
said
at
the
château
but
jean
has
declined
our
invitation
and
so
i
come
here
to
say
it
to
le
curé
i
am
listening
mademoiselle
stammered
the
curé
i
am
rich
le
curé
and
to
speak
the
truth
i
like
my
money
very
much
i
like
it
selfishly
so
to
say
for
the
joy
and
pleasure
i
have
in
giving
i
have
always
said
to
myself
husband
must
be
worthy
of
sharing
this
fortune
and
i
have
also
said
want
to
love
the
man
who
will
be
my
husband
and
now
i
am
coming
to
my
confession
here
is
a
man
who
for
two
months
has
done
all
he
could
to
hide
from
me
that
he
loves
me
jean
do
you
love
me
yes
murmured
jean
his
eyes
cast
down
like
a
criminal
i
love
you
i
knew
it
bettina
lost
a
little
of
her
assurance
her
voice
trembled
slightly
she
continued
however
with
an
effort
le
curé
i
do
not
blame
you
entirely
for
what
has
happened
but
certainly
it
is
partly
your
fault
my
fault
yes
your
fault
i
am
certain
you
have
spoken
to
jean
too
much
of
me
much
too
much
and
then
you
have
told
me
too
much
of
him
no
not
too
much
but
quite
enough
i
had
so
much
confidence
in
you
that
i
began
to
consider
him
a
little
more
closely
i
began
to
compare
him
with
those
who
for
more
than
a
year
have
sought
my
hand
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
their
superior
in
every
way
then
there
came
a
day
an
evening
three
weeks
ago
the
eve
of
your
departure
jean
and
i
found
i
loved
you
yes
jean
i
love
you
i
beg
you
jean
be
still
do
not
come
near
me
i
have
still
something
to
say
more
important
than
all
i
know
that
you
love
me
but
if
you
are
to
marry
me
i
want
your
reason
to
sanction
it
jean
i
know
you
and
i
know
to
what
i
should
bind
myself
in
becoming
your
wife
i
know
what
duties
what
sacrifices
you
have
to
meet
in
your
calling
jean
do
not
doubt
it
i
would
not
turn
you
from
any
one
of
these
duties
these
sacrifices
never
never
would
i
ask
you
to
give
up
your
career
and
now
le
curé
it
is
not
to
him
but
to
you
that
i
speak
tell
me
should
he
not
agree
to
be
my
husband
jean
said
the
old
priest
gravely
marry
her
it
is
your
duty
and
it
will
be
your
happiness
jean
took
bettina
in
his
arms
but
she
gently
freed
herself
and
said
to
the
abbé
i
wish
i
wish
your
blessing
and
the
old
priest
replied
by
kissing
her
paternally
one
month
later
the
abbé
had
the
happiness
of
performing
the
marriage
ceremony
in
his
little
church
where
he
had
consecrated
all
the
happiness
and
goodness
of
his
life

view
of

ancestors
nathaniel
hawthorne
died
on
may
the
pedestal
of
the
before
the
jail
in
prison
lane
on
a
certain
summer
morning
not
less
than
two
centuries
ago
was
occupied
by
a
pretty
large
number
of
the
inhabitants
of
boston
all
with
their
eyes
intently
fastened
on
the
oaken
door
the
door
of
the
jail
being
flung
open
from
within
there
appeared
in
the
first
place
the
grim
presence
of
the
and
following
him
a
young
woman
who
bore
in
her
arms
a
baby
of
some
three
months
old
the
young
woman
was
tall
and
those
who
had
known
hester
prynne
before
were
astonished
to
perceive
how
her
beauty
shone
out
on
the
breast
of
her
gown
in
fine
red
cloth
surrounded
with
an
elaborate
embroidery
and
fantastic
flourishes
of
gold
thread
appeared
the
letter
a
and
it
was
that
scarlet
letter
which
drew
all
eyes
and
as
it
were
transfigured
the
wearer
a
lane
was
forthwith
opened
through
the
crowd
of
spectators
preceded
by
the
beadle
and
attended
by
an
irregular
procession
of
men
and
unkindly
visaged
women
hester
prynne
set
forth
towards
the
place
appointed
for
her
punishment
it
was
no
great
distance
from
the
prison
door
to
the
and
in
spite
of
the
agony
of
her
heart
hester
passed
with
almost
a
serene
deportment
to
the
scaffold
where
the
pillory
was
set
up
the
crowd
was
sombre
and
grave
and
the
unhappy
prisoner
sustained
herself
as
best
a
woman
might
under
the
heavy
weight
of
a
thousand
unrelenting
eyes
one
man
small
in
stature
and
of
a
remarkable
intelligence
in
his
features
who
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
attracted
the
notice
of
hester
prynne
and
he
in
his
turn
bent
his
eyes
on
the
prisoner
till
seeing
she
appeared
to
recognise
him
he
slowly
raised
his
finger
and
laid
it
on
his
lips
then
touching
the
shoulder
of
a
townsman
who
stood
next
to
him
he
said
i
pray
you
good
sir
who
is
this
woman
and
wherefore
is
she
here
set
up
to
public
shame
you
must
needs
be
a
stranger
friend
said
the
townsman
else
you
would
surely
have
heard
of
mistress
hester
prynne
and
her
evil
doings
she
hath
raised
a
great
scandal
in
godly
master
dimmesdale
church
the
penalty
thereof
is
death
but
the
magistracy
in
their
great
mercy
and
tenderness
of
heart
have
doomed
mistress
prynne
to
stand
only
a
space
of
three
hours
on
the
platform
of
the
pillory
and
for
the
remainder
of
her
natural
life
to
wear
a
mark
of
shame
upon
her
bosom
a
wise
sentence
remarked
the
stranger
gravely
it
irks
me
nevertheless
that
the
partner
of
her
iniquity
should
not
at
least
stand
on
the
scaffold
by
her
side
but
he
will
be
known
he
will
be
known
directly
over
the
platform
on
which
hester
prynne
stood
was
a
kind
of
balcony
and
here
sat
governor
bellingham
with
four
sergeants
about
his
chair
and
ministers
of
religion
john
wilson
the
eldest
of
these
clergymen
first
spake
and
then
urged
a
younger
minister
dimmesdale
to
exhort
the
prisoner
to
repentance
and
to
confession
speak
to
the
woman
my
brother
said
wilson
the
rev
dimmesdale
was
a
man
of
high
native
gifts
whose
eloquence
and
religious
fervour
had
already
wide
eminence
in
his
profession
he
bent
his
head
in
silent
prayer
as
it
seemed
and
then
came
forward
hester
prynne
said
he
if
thou
feelest
it
to
be
for
thy
peace
i
charge
thee
to
speak
out
the
name
of
thy
and
be
not
silent
from
any
mistaken
pity
and
tenderness
for
him
for
believe
me
though
he
were
to
step
down
from
a
high
place
and
stand
there
beside
thee
on
thy
pedestal
of
shame
yet
better
were
it
so
than
to
hide
a
guilty
heart
through
life
hester
only
shook
her
head
she
will
not
speak
murmured
dimmesdale
wondrous
strength
and
generosity
of
a
woman
heart
hester
prynne
kept
her
place
upon
the
pedestal
of
shame
with
an
air
of
weary
indifference
with
the
same
hard
demeanour
she
was
led
back
to
prison
that
night
the
child
at
her
boson
writhed
in
convulsions
of
pain
and
the
jailer
brought
in
a
physician
whom
he
announced
as
roger
chillingworth
and
who
was
none
other
than
the
stranger
whom
hester
had
noticed
in
the
crowd
he
took
the
infant
in
his
arms
and
administered
a
draught
and
its
moans
and
convulsive
tossings
gradually
ceased
hester
said
he
when
the
jailer
had
withdrawn
i
ask
not
wherefore
thou
hast
fallen
into
the
pit
it
was
my
folly
and
thy
weakness
what
had
i
a
man
of
thought
the
bookworm
of
great
libraries
to
do
with
youth
and
beauty
like
thine
own
i
might
have
known
that
in
my
long
absence
this
would
happen
i
have
greatly
wronged
thee
murmured
hester
we
have
wronged
each
other
he
answered
but
i
shall
seek
this
man
whose
name
thou
wilt
not
reveal
as
i
seek
truth
in
books
and
sooner
or
later
he
must
needs
be
mine
i
shall
contrive
naught
against
his
life
let
him
live
not
the
less
shall
he
be
mine
one
thing
thou
that
wast
my
wife
i
ask
thou
hast
kept
his
name
secret
keep
likewise
mine
let
thy
husband
be
to
the
world
as
one
already
dead
and
breathe
not
the
secret
above
all
to
the
man
thou
wottest
of
i
will
keep
thy
secret
as
i
have
his
a
pearl
of
great
when
her
was
thrown
open
and
she
came
forth
into
the
sunshine
hester
prynne
did
not
flee
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
was
a
small
thatched
cottage
and
there
in
this
lonesome
dwelling
hester
established
herself
with
her
infant
child
without
a
friend
on
earth
who
dared
to
show
himself
she
however
incurred
no
risk
of
want
she
possessed
an
art
that
sufficed
to
supply
food
for
her
thriving
infant
and
herself
the
art
of
needlework
by
degrees
her
handiwork
became
what
would
now
be
termed
the
fashion
she
bore
on
her
breast
in
the
curiously
embroidered
letter
a
specimen
of
her
skill
and
her
needlework
was
seen
on
the
ruff
of
the
governor
military
men
wore
it
on
their
scarfs
and
the
minister
on
his
bands
as
time
went
on
the
public
attitude
to
hester
changed
human
nature
to
its
credit
loves
more
readily
than
it
hates
hester
never
battled
with
the
public
but
submitted
uncomplainingly
to
its
worst
usage
and
so
a
species
of
general
regard
had
ultimately
grown
up
in
reference
to
her
hester
had
named
the
infant
pearl
as
being
of
great
price
and
little
pearl
grew
up
a
wondrously
lovely
child
with
a
strange
lawless
character
at
times
she
seemed
rather
an
airy
sprite
than
human
and
never
did
she
seek
to
make
acquaintance
with
other
children
but
was
always
hester
companion
in
her
walks
about
the
town
at
one
time
some
of
the
leading
inhabitants
of
the
place
sought
to
deprive
hester
of
her
child
and
at
the
governor
mansion
whither
hester
had
repaired
with
some
gloves
which
she
had
embroidered
at
his
order
the
matter
was
discussed
in
the
mother
presence
by
the
governor
and
his
guests
john
wilson
arthur
dimmesdale
and
old
roger
chillingworth
now
established
as
a
physician
of
great
skill
in
the
town
god
gave
me
the
child
cried
hester
he
gave
her
in
requital
of
all
things
else
which
ye
have
taken
from
me
ye
shall
not
take
her
i
will
die
first
speak
thou
for
me
she
cried
turning
to
the
young
clergyman
dimmesdale
thou
wast
my
pastor
thou
knowest
what
is
in
my
heart
and
what
are
a
mother
rights
and
how
much
the
stronger
they
are
when
that
mother
has
but
her
child
and
the
scarlet
letter
i
will
not
lose
the
child
look
to
it
there
is
truth
in
what
she
says
began
the
minister
god
gave
her
the
child
and
there
is
a
quality
of
awful
sacredness
between
this
mother
and
this
child
it
is
good
for
this
poor
sinful
woman
that
she
hath
an
infant
confided
to
her
care
to
be
trained
up
by
her
to
righteousness
to
remind
her
and
to
teach
her
that
if
she
bring
the
child
to
heaven
the
child
also
will
bring
its
parent
thither
let
us
then
leave
them
as
providence
hath
seen
fit
to
place
them
you
speak
my
friend
with
a
strange
earnestness
said
old
roger
chillingworth
smiling
at
him
he
hath
adduced
such
arguments
that
we
will
even
leave
the
matter
as
it
now
stands
said
the
governor
so
long
at
least
as
there
shall
be
no
further
scandal
in
the
woman
the
affair
being
so
satisfactorily
concluded
hester
prynne
with
pearl
departed
the
leach
and
his
it
was
at
the
solemn
request
of
the
deacons
and
elders
of
the
church
in
boston
that
the
rev
dimmesdale
went
to
roger
chillingworth
for
professional
advice
the
young
minister
health
was
failing
his
cheek
was
paler
and
thinner
and
his
voice
more
tremulous
with
every
successive
sabbath
roger
chillingworth
scrutinised
his
patient
carefully
and
accepted
as
the
medical
adviser
determined
to
know
the
man
before
attempting
to
do
him
good
he
strove
to
go
deep
into
his
patient
bosom
delving
among
his
principles
and
prying
into
his
recollections
after
a
time
at
a
hint
from
old
roger
chillingworth
the
friends
of
dimmesdale
effected
an
arrangement
by
which
the
two
men
were
lodged
in
the
same
house
so
that
every
ebb
and
flow
of
the
minister
might
pass
under
the
watchful
eye
of
his
anxious
physician
old
roger
chillingworth
throughout
life
had
been
calm
in
temperament
of
kindly
affections
and
ever
in
the
world
a
pure
and
upright
man
he
had
begun
an
investigation
as
he
imagined
with
the
severe
integrity
of
a
judge
desirous
only
of
truth
but
as
he
proceeded
a
terrible
fascination
seized
the
old
man
within
its
grip
and
never
set
him
free
again
until
he
had
done
all
its
bidding
he
now
dug
into
the
poor
clergyman
heart
like
a
miner
searching
for
gold
this
man
the
physician
would
say
to
himself
at
times
pure
as
they
deem
him
hath
inherited
a
strong
animal
nature
from
his
father
or
his
mother
let
us
dig
a
little
farther
in
the
direction
of
this
vein
henceforth
roger
chillingworth
became
not
a
spectator
only
but
a
chief
actor
in
the
poor
minister
inner
world
and
dimmesdale
grew
to
look
with
unaccountable
horror
and
hatred
at
the
old
physician
and
still
the
minister
fame
and
reputation
for
holiness
increased
even
while
he
was
tortured
by
bodily
disease
and
the
black
trouble
of
his
soul
more
than
once
dimmesdale
had
gone
into
the
pulpit
with
a
purpose
never
to
come
down
until
he
should
have
spoken
the
truth
of
his
life
and
ever
he
put
a
cheat
upon
himself
by
confessing
in
general
terms
his
exceeding
vileness
and
sinfulness
one
night
in
early
may
driven
by
remorse
and
still
indulging
in
the
mockery
of
repentance
the
minister
sought
the
scaffold
where
hester
prynne
had
stood
the
town
was
all
asleep
there
was
no
peril
of
discovery
and
yet
his
vigil
was
surprised
by
hester
and
her
daughter
returning
from
a
in
the
town
and
presently
by
roger
chillingworth
himself
who
is
that
man
gasped
dimmesdale
in
terror
i
shiver
at
him
hester
canst
thou
do
nothing
for
me
i
have
a
nameless
horror
of
the
man
hester
remembered
her
promise
and
was
silent
worthy
sir
said
the
physician
when
he
had
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
platform
pious
master
dimmesdale
can
this
be
you
come
good
sir
i
pray
you
let
me
lead
you
home
you
should
study
less
or
these
will
grow
upon
you
i
will
go
home
with
you
said
dimmesdale
and
now
hester
prynne
resolved
to
do
what
might
be
in
her
power
for
the
victim
whom
she
saw
in
her
former
husband
grip
an
opportunity
soon
occurred
when
she
met
the
old
physician
stooping
in
quest
of
roots
to
concoct
his
medicines
when
we
last
spake
together
said
hester
you
bound
me
to
secrecy
touching
our
former
relations
but
now
i
must
reveal
the
secret
he
must
discern
thee
in
thy
true
character
what
may
be
the
result
i
know
not
so
far
as
concerns
the
overthrow
or
preservation
of
his
fair
fame
and
his
earthly
state
and
perchance
his
life
he
is
in
thy
hands
nor
do
i
whom
the
scarlet
letter
has
disciplined
to
truth
nor
do
i
perceive
such
advantage
in
his
living
any
longer
a
life
of
ghastly
emptiness
that
i
shall
stoop
to
implore
thy
mercy
do
with
him
as
thou
wilt
there
is
no
good
for
him
no
good
for
me
no
good
for
thee
there
is
no
good
for
little
pearl
woman
i
could
pity
thee
said
roger
chillingworth
peradventure
hadst
thou
met
earlier
with
a
better
love
than
mine
this
evil
had
not
been
i
pity
thee
for
the
good
that
has
been
wasted
in
thy
nature
and
i
thee
answered
hester
prynne
for
the
hatred
that
has
transformed
a
wise
and
just
man
to
a
fiend
forgive
if
not
for
his
sake
then
doubly
for
thine
own
peace
hester
peace
replied
the
old
man
with
gloom
it
is
not
granted
me
to
pardon
it
is
our
fate
now
go
thy
ways
and
deal
as
thou
wilt
with
yonder
man
a
week
later
hester
prynne
waited
in
the
forest
for
the
minister
as
he
returned
from
a
visit
to
his
indian
converts
he
walked
slowly
and
as
he
walked
kept
his
hand
over
his
heart
arthur
dimmesdale
arthur
dimmesdale
she
cried
out
who
speaks
answered
the
minister
hester
hester
prynne
is
it
thou
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
and
added
hester
hast
thou
found
peace
hast
thou
she
asked
none
nothing
but
despair
what
else
could
i
look
for
being
what
i
am
and
leading
such
a
life
as
mine
you
wrong
yourself
in
this
said
hester
gently
your
sin
is
left
behind
you
in
the
days
long
past
but
arthur
an
enemy
dwellest
with
thee
under
the
same
roof
that
old
man
the
physician
whom
they
call
roger
chillingworth
he
was
my
husband
forgive
me
let
god
punish
i
do
forgive
you
hester
replied
the
minister
may
god
forgive
us
both
they
sat
down
hand
clasped
in
hand
on
the
mossy
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
it
was
hester
who
bade
him
hope
and
spoke
of
seeking
a
new
life
beyond
the
seas
in
some
rural
village
in
europe
oh
hester
cried
arthur
dimmesdale
i
lack
the
strength
and
courage
to
venture
out
into
the
wide
strange
world
alone
thou
shalt
not
go
alone
she
whispered
before
dimmesdale
reached
home
he
was
conscious
of
a
change
of
thought
and
feeling
roger
chillingworth
observed
the
change
and
knew
that
now
in
the
regard
he
was
no
longer
a
trusted
friend
but
his
bitterest
enemy
a
new
england
holiday
was
at
hand
the
public
celebration
of
the
election
of
a
new
governor
and
the
rev
arthur
dimmesdale
was
to
preach
the
election
sermon
hester
had
taken
berths
in
a
vessel
that
was
about
to
sail
and
then
on
the
very
day
of
holiday
the
shipmaster
told
her
that
roger
chillingworth
had
also
taken
a
berth
in
the
same
vessel
hester
said
nothing
but
turned
away
and
waited
in
the
crowded
beside
the
pillory
with
pearl
while
the
procession
after
public
worship
the
street
and
the
absolutely
bubbled
with
applause
of
the
minister
whose
sermon
had
surpassed
all
previous
utterances
at
that
moment
arthur
dimmesdale
stood
on
the
proudest
eminence
to
which
a
new
england
clergyman
could
be
exalted
the
minister
surrounded
by
the
leading
men
of
the
town
halted
at
the
scaffold
and
turning
towards
it
cried
hester
come
hither
come
my
little
pearl
leaning
on
hester
shoulder
the
minister
with
the
child
hand
in
his
slowly
ascended
the
scaffold
steps
is
not
this
better
he
murmured
than
what
we
dreamed
of
in
the
forest
for
hester
i
am
a
dying
man
so
let
me
make
haste
to
take
my
shame
upon
me
i
know
not
i
know
not
better
yea
so
we
may
both
die
and
little
pearl
die
with
us
he
turned
to
the
and
spoke
with
a
voice
that
all
could
hear
people
of
new
england
at
last
at
last
i
stand
where
seven
years
since
i
should
have
stood
lo
the
scarlet
letter
which
hester
wears
ye
have
all
shuddered
at
it
but
there
stood
one
in
the
midst
of
you
at
whose
hand
of
sin
and
infamy
ye
have
not
shuddered
stand
any
here
that
question
god
judgement
on
a
sinner
behold
a
dreadful
witness
of
it
with
a
convulsive
motion
he
tore
away
the
ministerial
gown
from
before
his
breast
it
was
revealed
for
an
instant
the
multitude
gazed
with
horror
on
the
ghastly
miracle
while
the
minister
stood
with
a
flush
of
triumph
in
his
face
then
down
he
sank
upon
the
scaffold
hester
partly
raised
him
and
supported
his
head
against
her
bosom
old
roger
chillingworth
knelt
beside
him
thou
hast
escaped
me
he
repeated
more
than
once
may
god
forgive
thee
said
the
minister
thou
too
hast
deeply
sinned
he
fixed
his
dying
eyes
on
the
woman
and
the
child
my
little
pearl
he
said
feebly
thou
wilt
kiss
me
hester
farewell
god
knows
and
he
is
merciful
his
will
be
done
farewell
that
final
word
came
forth
with
the
minister
expiring
breath
the
multitude
silent
till
then
broke
out
in
a
strange
deep
voice
of
awe
and
wonder
after
many
days
there
was
more
than
one
account
of
what
had
been
witnessed
on
the
scaffold
most
of
the
spectators
testified
to
having
seen
on
the
breast
of
the
unhappy
minister
a
scarlet
letter
imprinted
in
the
flesh
others
denied
that
there
was
any
mark
whatever
on
his
breast
more
than
on
a
infant
according
to
these
highly
respectable
witnesses
the
minister
confession
implied
no
part
of
the
guilt
of
hester
prynne
but
was
to
teach
us
that
we
were
all
sinners
alike
old
roger
chillingworth
died
and
bequeathed
his
property
to
little
pearl
for
years
the
mother
and
child
lived
in
england
and
then
pearl
married
and
hester
returned
alone
to
the
little
cottage
by
the
forest
the
house
of
the
seven
gables
the
house
of
the
seven
gables
published
in
was
written
by
nathaniel
hawthorne
directly
after
the
scarlet
letter
and
though
not
equal
to
that
remarkable
book
was
full
worthy
of
its
author
reputation
and
brought
no
disappointment
to
those
who
looked
for
great
things
from
his
pen
it
seemed
to
james
russell
lowell
the
highest
art
to
typify
in
the
revived
likeness
of
judge
pyncheon
to
his
ancestor
the
colonel
that
intimate
relationship
between
the
present
and
the
past
in
the
way
of
ancestry
and
descent
which
historians
so
carefully
overlook
here
as
in
the
scarlet
letter
hawthorne
is
unsparing
in
his
analysis
of
the
meaning
of
early
american
puritanism
its
intolerance
and
its
strength

the
old
pyncheon
house
and
an

before
the

is
known
as
the
pyncheon
elm
pyncheon
street
formerly
bore
the
humbler
appellation
of

from
the
name
of
the
original
occupant
of
the
soil
before
whose
cottage
door
it
was
a
in
the
growth
of
the
town
however
after
some
thirty
or
forty
years
the
site
covered
by
the
rude
hovel
of
matthew
maule
originally
remote
from
the
centre
of
the
earlier
village
had
become
exceedingly
desirable
in
the
eyes
of
a
prominent
personage
who
asserted
claims
to
the
land
on
the
strength
of
a
grant
from
the
legislature
colonel
pyncheon
the
claimant
was
a
man
of
iron
energy
of
purpose
matthew
maule
though
an
obscure
man
was
stubborn
in
the
defense
of
what
he
considered
his
right
the
dispute
remained
for
years
undecided
and
came
to
a
close
only
with
the
death
of
old
matthew
maule
who
was
executed
for
the
crime
of
witchcraft
it
was
remembered
afterwards
how
loudly
colonel
pyncheon
had
joined
in
the
general
cry
to
purge
the
land
from
witchcraft
and
had
sought
zealously
the
condemnation
of
matthew
maule
at
the
moment
of
execution
with
the
halter
about
his
neck
and
while
colonel
pyncheon
sat
on
horseback
grimly
gazing
at
the
scene
maule
had
addressed
him
from
the
scaffold
and
uttered
a
prophecy
god
said
the
dying
man
pointing
his
finger
at
the
countenance
of
his
enemy
god
will
give
him
blood
to
drink
when
it
was
understood
that
colonel
pyncheon
intended
to
erect
a
spacious
family
mansion
on
the
spot
first
covered
by
the
hut
of
matthew
maule
the
village
gossips
shook
their
heads
and
hinted
that
he
was
about
to
build
his
house
over
an
unquiet
grave
but
the
puritan
soldier
and
magistrate
was
not
a
man
to
be
turned
aside
from
his
scheme
by
dread
of
the
reputed
wizzard
ghost
he
dug
his
cellar
and
laid
deep
the
foundations
of
his
mansion
and
the
of
the
house
of
the
seven
gables
was
no
other
than
thomas
maule
the
son
of
the
dead
man
from
whom
the
right
to
the
soil
had
been
wrested
on
the
day
the
house
was
finished
colonel
pyncheon
bade
all
the
town
to
be
his
guests
and
maude
lane
or
pyncheon
street
as
it
was
now
called
was
thronged
at
the
appointed
hour
as
with
a
congregation
on
its
way
to
church
but
the
founder
of
the
stately
mansion
did
not
stand
in
his
own
hall
to
welcome
the
eminent
persons
who
presented
themselves
in
honour
of
the
solemn
festival
and
the
principal
domestic
had
to
explain
that
his
master
still
remained
in
his
study
which
he
had
entered
an
hour
before
the
took
the
matter
into
his
hands
and
knocked
boldly
at
the
door
of
the
colonel
private
apartment
and
getting
no
answer
he
tried
the
door
which
yielded
to
his
hand
and
was
flung
wide
open
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
the
company
thronged
to
the
now
open
door
pressing
the
into
the
room
before
them
a
large
map
and
a
portrait
of
colonel
pyncheon
were
conspicuous
on
the
walls
and
beneath
the
portrait
sat
the
colonel
himself
in
an
elbow
chair
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
a
little
boy
the
colonel
grandchild
now
made
his
way
among
the
guests
and
ran
towards
the
seated
figure
then
pausing
halfway
he
began
to
shriek
with
terror
the
company
drew
nearer
and
perceived
that
there
was
blood
on
the
colonel
cuff
and
on
his
beard
and
an
unnatural
distortion
in
his
fixed
stare
it
was
too
late
to
render
assistance
the
puritan
the
relentless
persecutor
the
grasping
and
man
was
dead
dead
in
his
new
house
colonel
pyncheon
sudden
and
mysterious
end
made
a
vast
deal
of
noise
in
its
day
there
were
many
rumours
and
a
great
dispute
of
doctors
over
the
dead
body
but
the
coroner
jury
sat
upon
the
corpse
and
like
sensible
men
returned
an
unassailable
verdict
of
sudden
death
the
son
and
heir
came
into
immediate
enjoyment
of
a
considerable
estate
but
a
claim
to
a
large
tract
of
country
in
waldo
county
maine
which
the
colonel
had
he
lived
would
undoubtedly
have
made
good
was
lost
by
his
decease
some
connecting
link
had
slipped
out
of
the
evidence
and
could
not
be
found
still
from
generation
to
generation
the
pyncheons
cherished
an
absurd
delusion
of
family
importance
on
the
strength
of
this
impalpable
claim
and
from
father
to
son
they
clung
with
tenacity
to
the
ancestral
house
for
the
better
part
of
two
centuries
the
most
noted
event
in
the
pyncheon
annals
in
the
last
fifty
years
had
been
the
violent
death
of
the
chief
member
of
the
family
an
old
and
wealthy
bachelor
one
of
his
nephews
clifford
was
found
guilty
of
the
murder
and
was
sentenced
to
perpetual
imprisonment
this
had
happened
thirty
years
ago
and
there
were
now
rumours
that
the
criminal
was
about
to
be
released
another
nephew
had
become
the
heir
and
was
now
a
judge
in
an
inferior
court
the
only
members
of
the
family
known
to
be
extant
besides
the
judge
and
the
thirty
years
prisoner
were
a
sister
of
the
latter
wretchedly
poor
who
lived
in
the
house
of
the
seven
gables
by
the
will
of
the
old
bachelor
and
the
judge
single
surviving
son
now
travelling
in
europe
the
last
and
youngest
pyncheon
was
a
little
country
girl
of
seventeen
whose
father
another
of
the
judge
cousins
was
dead
and
whose
mother
had
taken
another
husband
the
house
without
miss
hepzibah
pyncheon
was
reduced
to
the
business
of
setting
up
a
pretty
shop
and
that
in
the
pyncheon
house
where
she
had
spent
all
her
days
after
sixty
years
of
idleness
and
seclusion
she
must
earn
her
bread
or
starve
and
to
keep
shop
was
the
only
resource
open
to
her
the
first
customer
to
cross
the
threshold
was
a
young
man
to
whom
old
hepzibah
let
certain
remote
rooms
in
the
house
of
the
seven
gables
he
explained
that
he
had
looked
in
to
offer
his
best
wishes
and
to
see
if
he
could
give
any
assistance
poor
hepzibah
when
she
heard
the
kindly
tone
of
his
voice
began
to
sob
ah
holgrave
she
cried
i
never
can
go
through
with
it
never
never
never
i
wish
i
were
dead
in
the
old
family
tomb
with
all
my
forefathers
yes
and
with
my
brother
who
had
far
better
find
me
there
than
here
i
am
too
old
too
feeble
and
too
hopeless
if
old
ghost
or
a
descendant
of
his
could
see
me
behind
the
counter
he
would
call
it
the
fulfilment
of
his
worst
wishes
but
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
holgrave
and
will
do
my
utmost
to
be
a
good
shopkeeper
on
holgrave
asking
for
half
a
dozen
biscuits
hepzibah
put
them
into
his
hand
but
rejected
the
compensation
let
me
be
a
lady
a
moment
longer
she
said
with
a
manner
of
antique
stateliness
a
pyncheon
must
not
at
all
events
under
her
roof
receive
money
for
a
morsel
of
bread
from
her
only
friend
as
the
day
went
on
the
poor
lady
blundered
hopelessly
with
her
customers
and
committed
the
most
errors
so
that
the
whole
proceeds
of
her
painful
traffic
amounted
at
the
close
to
half
a
dozen
coppers
that
night
the
little
country
cousin
phoebe
pyncheon
arrived
at
the
gloomy
old
house
hepzibah
knew
that
circumstances
made
it
desirable
for
the
girl
to
establish
herself
in
another
home
but
she
was
reluctant
to
bid
her
stay
phoebe
she
said
on
the
following
morning
this
house
of
mine
is
but
a
melancholy
place
for
a
young
person
to
be
in
it
lets
in
the
wind
and
rain
and
the
snow
too
in
the
winter
time
but
it
never
lets
in
the
sunshine
and
as
for
myself
you
see
what
i
am
a
dismal
and
lonesome
old
woman
whose
temper
is
none
of
the
best
and
whose
spirits
are
as
bad
as
can
be
i
can
not
make
your
life
pleasant
cousin
phoebe
neither
can
i
so
much
as
give
you
bread
to
eat
you
will
find
me
a
cheerful
little
body
answered
phoebe
smiling
and
i
mean
to
earn
my
bread
you
know
i
have
not
been
brought
up
a
pyncheon
a
girl
learns
many
things
in
a
new
england
village
ah
phoebe
said
hepzibah
sighing
it
is
a
wretched
thought
that
you
should
fling
away
your
young
days
in
a
place
like
this
and
after
all
it
is
not
even
for
me
to
say
who
shall
be
a
guest
or
inhabitant
of
the
old
pyncheon
house
its
master
is
coming
do
you
mean
judge
pyncheon
asked
phoebe
in
surprise
judge
pyncheon
answered
her
cousin
angrily
he
will
hardly
cross
the
threshold
while
i
live
you
shall
see
the
face
of
him
i
speak
of
she
went
in
quest
of
a
miniature
and
returned
and
placed
it
in
hand
how
do
you
like
the
face
asked
hepzibah
it
is
handsome
it
is
very
beautiful
said
phoebe
admiringly
it
is
as
sweet
a
face
as
a
man
can
be
or
ought
to
be
who
is
it
cousin
hepzibah
did
you
never
hear
of
clifford
pyncheon
never
i
thought
there
were
no
pyncheons
left
except
yourself
and
our
cousin
jaffrey
the
judge
and
yet
i
seem
to
have
heard
the
name
of
clifford
pyncheon
yes
from
my
father
or
my
mother
but
has
he
been
dead
a
long
while
well
well
child
perhaps
he
has
said
hepzibah
with
a
sad
hollow
laugh
but
in
old
houses
like
this
you
know
dead
people
are
very
apt
to
come
back
again
and
cousin
phoebe
if
your
courage
does
not
fail
you
we
will
not
part
soon
you
are
welcome
to
such
a
home
as
i
can
offer
you
miss
hepzibah
the
day
after
phoebe
arrival
there
was
a
constant
tremor
in
frame
with
all
her
affection
for
a
young
cousin
there
was
a
recurring
irritability
bear
with
me
my
dear
child
she
cried
bear
with
me
for
i
love
you
phoebe
and
truly
my
heart
is
full
to
the
brim
i
shall
be
kind
and
only
kind
what
has
happened
asked
phoebe
what
is
it
that
moves
you
so
hush
he
is
coming
whispered
hepzibah
let
him
see
you
first
phoebe
for
you
are
young
and
rosy
and
can
not
help
letting
a
smile
break
out
he
always
liked
bright
faces
and
mine
is
old
now
and
the
tears
are
hardly
dry
on
it
draw
the
curtain
a
little
but
let
there
be
a
good
deal
of
sunshine
too
he
has
had
but
little
sunshine
in
his
life
poor
clifford
and
oh
what
a
black
shadow
poor
poor
clifford
there
was
a
step
in
the
above
stairs
it
seemed
to
phoebe
the
same
that
she
had
heard
in
the
night
as
in
a
dream
very
slowly
the
steps
came
downstairs
and
paused
for
a
long
time
at
the
door
hepzibah
unable
to
endure
the
suspense
rushed
forward
threw
open
the
door
and
led
in
the
stranger
by
the
hand
at
the
first
glance
phoebe
saw
an
elderly
man
in
an
dressing
gown
with
grey
hair
almost
white
of
an
unusual
length
the
expression
of
his
countenance
seemed
to
waver
glimmer
and
nearly
to
die
away
and
feebly
to
recover
itself
again
dear
clifford
said
hepzibah
this
is
our
cousin
phoebe
only
child
you
know
she
has
come
from
the
country
to
stay
with
us
a
while
for
our
old
house
has
grown
to
be
very
lonely
now
phoebe
arthur
child
repeated
the
guest
ah
i
forget
no
matter
she
is
very
welcome
he
seated
himself
in
the
place
assigned
him
and
looked
strangely
around
his
eyes
met
hepzibah
and
he
seemed
bewildered
and
disgusted
is
this
you
hepzibah
he
murmured
sadly
how
changed
how
changed
there
is
nothing
but
love
here
clifford
hepzibah
said
softly
nothing
but
love
you
are
at
home
the
guest
responded
to
her
tone
by
a
smile
which
but
half
lit
up
his
face
it
was
followed
by
a
coarser
expression
and
he
ate
his
food
with
fierce
voracity
and
asked
for
more
more
that
day
phoebe
attended
to
the
shop
and
the
second
person
to
enter
it
was
a
gentleman
of
portly
figure
and
high
respectability
i
was
not
aware
that
miss
hepzibah
pyncheon
had
commenced
business
under
such
favourable
auspices
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
you
are
her
assistant
i
suppose
i
certainly
am
answered
phoebe
i
am
a
cousin
of
miss
hepzibah
on
a
visit
to
her
her
cousin
and
from
the
country
said
the
gentleman
bowing
and
smiling
in
that
case
we
must
be
better
acquainted
for
you
are
my
own
little
kinswoman
likewise
let
me
see
you
must
be
phoebe
the
only
child
of
my
dear
cousin
arthur
i
am
your
kinsman
my
dear
surely
you
must
have
heard
of
judge
pyncheon
phoebe
curtsied
and
the
judge
bent
forward
to
bestow
a
kiss
on
his
young
relative
but
phoebe
drew
back
there
was
something
repulsive
to
her
in
the
judge
demonstration
and
on
raising
her
eyes
she
was
startled
by
the
change
in
judge
pyncheon
face
it
had
become
cold
hard
and
immitigable
dear
me
what
is
to
be
done
now
thought
the
country
girl
to
herself
he
looks
as
if
there
were
nothing
softer
in
him
than
a
rock
nor
milder
than
the
east
wind
then
all
at
once
it
struck
phoebe
that
this
very
judge
pyncheon
was
the
original
of
a
miniature
which
holgrave
who
took
portraits
and
whose
acquaintance
she
had
made
within
a
few
hours
of
her
arrival
had
shown
her
yesterday
there
was
the
same
hard
stern
relentless
look
on
the
face
in
reality
the
miniature
was
copied
from
an
old
portrait
of
colonel
pyncheon
which
hung
within
the
house
was
it
that
the
expression
had
been
transmitted
down
as
a
precious
heirloom
from
that
puritan
ancestor
in
whose
picture
both
the
expression
and
to
a
singular
degree
the
features
of
the
modern
judge
were
shown
as
by
a
kind
of
prophecy
but
as
it
happened
scarcely
had
phoebe
eyes
rested
again
on
the
judge
countenance
than
all
its
ugly
sternness
vanished
and
she
found
herself
almost
overpowered
by
the
warm
benevolence
of
his
look
but
the
fantasy
would
not
quit
her
that
the
original
puritan
of
whom
she
had
heard
so
many
sombre
traditions
had
now
stepped
into
the
shop
you
seem
to
be
a
little
nervous
this
morning
said
the
judge
has
anything
happened
to
disturb
you
anything
remarkable
in
cousin
hepzibah
family
an
arrival
eh
i
thought
so
to
be
an
inmate
with
such
a
guest
may
well
startle
an
innocent
young
girl
you
quite
puzzle
me
sir
replied
phoebe
there
is
no
frightful
guest
in
the
house
but
only
a
poor
gentle
man
whom
i
believe
to
be
cousin
hepzibah
brother
i
am
afraid
that
he
is
not
quite
in
his
sound
senses
but
so
mild
he
seems
to
be
that
a
mother
might
trust
her
baby
with
him
he
startle
me
oh
no
indeed
i
rejoice
to
hear
so
favourable
and
so
ingenious
an
account
of
my
cousin
clifford
said
the
benevolent
judge
it
is
possible
that
you
have
never
heard
of
clifford
pyncheon
and
know
nothing
of
his
history
but
is
clifford
in
the
parlour
i
will
just
step
in
and
see
him
there
is
no
need
to
announce
me
i
know
the
house
and
know
my
cousin
hepzibah
and
her
brother
clifford
likewise
ah
there
is
hepzibah
herself
such
was
the
case
the
vibrations
of
the
judge
voice
had
reached
the
old
gentlewoman
in
the
parlour
where
clifford
sat
slumbering
in
his
chair
he
can
not
see
you
said
hepzibah
with
quivering
voice
he
can
not
see
visitors
a
visitor
do
you
call
me
so
cried
the
judge
then
let
me
be
clifford
host
and
your
own
likewise
come
at
once
to
my
house
i
have
often
invited
you
before
come
and
we
will
labour
together
to
make
clifford
happy
clifford
has
a
home
here
she
answered
woman
broke
out
the
judge
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
have
you
other
resources
take
care
hepzibah
take
care
clifford
is
on
the
brink
of
as
black
a
ruin
as
ever
befel
him
yet
from
within
the
parlour
sounded
a
tremulous
wailing
voice
indicating
helpless
alarm
hepzibah
cried
the
voice
entreat
him
not
to
come
in
go
down
on
your
knees
to
him
oh
let
him
have
mercy
on
me
mercy
the
judge
withdrew
and
hepzibah
deathly
white
staggered
towards
phoebe
that
man
has
been
the
horror
of
my
life
she
murmured
shall
i
never
have
courage
enough
to
tell
him
what
he
is
the
spell
is
the
shop
thrived
under
phoebe
management
and
the
acquaintance
with
holgrave
ripened
into
friendship
then
after
some
weeks
phoebe
went
away
on
a
temporary
visit
to
her
mother
and
the
old
house
which
had
been
brightened
by
her
presence
was
once
more
dark
and
gloomy
it
was
during
this
absence
of
phoebe
that
judge
pyncheon
once
more
called
and
demanded
to
see
clifford
you
can
not
see
him
answered
hepzibah
clifford
has
kept
his
bed
since
yesterday
what
clifford
ill
said
the
judge
starting
then
i
must
and
will
see
him
the
judge
explained
the
reason
for
his
urgency
he
believed
that
clifford
could
give
the
clue
to
the
dead
uncle
wealth
of
which
not
more
than
a
half
had
been
mentioned
in
his
will
if
clifford
refused
to
reveal
where
the
missing
documents
were
placed
the
judge
declared
he
would
have
him
confined
in
a
public
asylum
as
a
lunatic
for
there
were
many
witnesses
of
clifford
simple
childlike
ways
you
are
stronger
than
i
said
hepzibah
and
you
have
no
pity
in
your
strength
clifford
is
not
now
insane
but
the
interview
which
you
insist
upon
may
go
far
to
make
him
so
nevertheless
i
will
call
clifford
hepzibah
went
in
search
of
her
brother
and
judge
pyncheon
flung
himself
down
in
an
old
chair
in
the
parlour
he
took
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
in
his
hand
but
clifford
was
not
in
his
room
nor
could
hepzibah
find
him
she
returned
to
the
parlour
calling
out
to
the
judge
as
she
came
to
rise
and
help
find
clifford
but
the
judge
never
moved
and
clifford
appeared
at
the
door
pointing
his
finger
at
the
judge
and
laughing
with
strange
excitement
hepzibah
he
said
we
can
dance
now
we
can
sing
laugh
play
do
what
we
will
the
weight
is
gone
hepzibah
gone
off
this
weary
old
world
and
we
may
be
as
lighthearted
as
little
phoebe
herself
what
an
absurd
figure
the
old
fellow
cuts
now
just
when
he
fancied
he
had
me
completely
under
his
thumb
then
the
brother
and
sister
departed
hastily
from
the
house
and
left
judge
pyncheon
sitting
in
the
old
house
of
his
forefathers
phoebe
and
holgrave
were
in
the
house
together
when
the
brother
and
sister
returned
and
holgrave
had
told
her
of
the
judge
sudden
death
then
in
that
hour
so
full
of
doubt
and
awe
the
one
miracle
was
wrought
without
which
every
human
existence
is
a
blank
and
the
bliss
which
makes
all
things
true
beautiful
and
holy
shone
around
this
youth
and
maiden
they
were
conscious
of
nothing
sad
or
old
presently
the
voices
of
clifford
and
hepzibah
were
heard
at
the
door
and
when
they
entered
clifford
appeared
the
stronger
of
the
two
it
is
our
own
little
phoebe
ah
and
holgrave
with
her
he
exclaimed
i
thought
of
you
both
as
we
came
down
the
street
and
so
the
flower
of
eden
has
bloomed
even
in
this
old
darksome
house
a
week
after
the
judge
death
news
came
of
the
death
of
his
son
and
so
hepzibah
became
rich
and
so
did
clifford
and
so
did
phoebe
and
through
her
holgrave
it
was
far
too
late
for
the
formal
vindication
of
clifford
character
to
be
worth
the
trouble
and
anguish
involved
for
the
truth
was
that
the
uncle
had
died
by
a
sudden
stroke
and
the
judge
knowing
this
had
let
suspicion
and
condemnation
fall
on
clifford
only
because
he
had
himself
been
busy
among
the
dead
man
papers
destroying
a
later
will
made
out
in
clifford
favour
and
because
it
was
found
the
papers
had
been
disturbed
to
avert
suspicion
from
the
real
offender
he
had
let
the
blame
fall
on
his
cousin
clifford
was
content
with
the
love
of
his
sister
and
phoebe
and
holgrave
the
good
opinion
of
society
was
not
worth
publicly
reclaiming
it
was
holgrave
who
discovered
the
missing
document
the
judge
had
set
his
heart
on
obtaining
and
now
my
dearest
phoebe
said
holgrave
how
will
it
please
you
to
assume
the
name
of
maule
in
this
long
drama
of
wrong
and
retribution
i
represent
the
old
wizzard
and
am
probably
as
much
of
a
wizzard
as
ever
my
ancestor
was
then
with
hepzibah
and
clifford
phoebe
and
holgrave
left
the
old
house
for
ever
robert
hichens
the
garden
of
allah
the
son
of
a
clergyman
robert
smythe
hichens
born
at
speldhurst
kent
england
on
november
was
originally
intended
to
follow
a
musical
career
but
after
some
years
abandoned
music
for
journalism
his
first
long
novel
was
written
and
published
at
the
age
of
seventeen
it
attracted
little
or
no
attention
and
has
long
been
out
of
print
a
trip
to
egypt
in
resulted
in
a
burning
desire
to
become
a
novelist
and
his
brilliant
satire
the
green
carnation
followed
the
book
was
written
in
a
month
and
at
once
established
its
author
name
and
fame
the
garden
of
allah
of
all
hichens
works
the
most
typical
of
his
genius
appeared
in
the
intellectual
grip
of
the
story
says
one
critic
can
not
be
denied
for
it
completely
conquers
the
critical
sense
and
the
ideas
of
the
author
insinuate
themselves
as
it
were
among
one
inmost
thoughts
yet
hichens
stories
are
popular
not
only
with
literary
connoisseurs
but
also
with
the
general
public
inasmuch
as
they
owe
their
fascination
not
so
much
to
an
extreme
refinement
of
art
as
to
their
freshness
of
imagination
and
dramatic
intensity
this
epitome
of
the
garden
of
allah
has
been
prepared
by
hichens
himself
the
home
of
on
an
autumn
evening
domini
enfilden
leaned
on
the
parapet
of
a
verandah
of
the
hotel
du
désert
at
in
southern
algeria
gazing
towards
the
great
sahara
which
was
lit
up
by
the
glory
of
sunset
the
bell
of
the
catholic
church
chimed
she
heard
the
throbbing
of
native
drums
in
the
village
near
by
tired
with
her
long
journey
from
england
she
watched
and
listened
while
the
twilight
crept
among
the
palms
and
the
sandy
alleys
grew
dark
an
orphan
unmarried
strong
fearless
ardent
but
a
deeply
religious
woman
and
a
catholic
domini
had
passed
through
much
mental
agony
her
mother
lady
rens
a
member
of
one
of
england
oldest
catholic
families
but
half
hungarian
on
the
mother
side
had
run
away
when
domini
was
nineteen
with
a
hungarian
musician
leaving
her
only
child
with
her
despairing
and
abandoned
husband
lord
rens
had
become
a
catholic
out
of
love
for
his
wife
when
he
was
deserted
by
her
he
furiously
renounced
his
faith
and
eventually
died
blaspheming
in
vain
through
many
years
he
had
tried
to
detach
his
daughter
from
the
religion
of
her
guilty
mother
now
long
since
dead
domini
had
known
how
to
resist
but
the
cruel
contest
had
shaken
her
body
and
soul
now
free
alone
she
had
left
england
to
begin
a
new
life
far
away
from
the
scene
of
her
misery
vaguely
she
had
thought
of
the
great
desert
called
by
the
arabs
the
garden
of
allah
as
the
home
of
peace
she
had
travelled
there
to
find
peace
that
day
at
the
gate
of
the
desert
she
had
met
a
traveller
doris
androvsky
a
man
of
about
powerfully
built
tanned
by
the
sun
when
she
was
about
to
get
into
the
train
at
the
station
of
el
akbara
this
man
had
rudely
sprung
in
before
her
the
train
had
begun
to
move
and
domini
had
sprung
into
it
almost
at
the
risk
of
her
life
androvsky
had
not
offered
to
help
her
had
not
said
a
word
of
apology
his
had
almost
revolted
domini
nevertheless
something
powerful
mournful
passionate
and
sincere
in
his
personality
had
affected
her
roused
her
interest
silently
they
had
come
into
the
desert
together
strangers
almost
at
enmity
the
one
with
the
other
they
were
now
staying
in
the
same
hotel
in
this
oasis
in
the
desert
of
sahara
in
coming
to
the
hotel
domini
had
seen
a
curious
incident
androvsky
with
a
guide
who
carried
his
bag
was
walking
before
her
down
the
long
public
garden
when
in
the
distance
there
appeared
the
black
figure
of
the
priest
of
advancing
slowly
towards
them
when
androvsky
saw
the
priest
he
had
stopped
short
hesitated
then
despite
the
protests
of
his
guide
had
abruptly
turned
down
a
side
path
and
hurried
away
he
had
fled
from
the
man
of
prayer
now
as
the
twilight
fell
domini
thought
of
this
incident
and
when
she
heard
androvsky
heavy
tread
upon
the
stairs
of
the
verandah
the
sharp
closing
of
the
french
window
of
his
room
she
was
filled
with
a
vague
uneasiness
next
day
she
visited
a
wonderful
garden
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
belonging
to
a
count
anteoni
a
recluse
who
loved
the
arabs
and
spent
much
of
his
time
among
them
there
standing
with
the
count
by
the
garden
wall
at
the
hour
of
the
mohammedan
prayer
she
had
seen
androvsky
again
he
was
in
the
desert
with
a
nomad
the
cry
of
the
went
up
to
the
brazen
sky
the
nomad
fell
on
his
knees
and
prayed
androvsky
started
gazed
shrank
back
then
turned
and
strode
away
like
one
horrified
by
some
grievous
vision
domini
said
to
the
count
i
have
just
seen
a
man
flee
from
prayer
it
was
horrible
he
answered
her
very
gravely
the
man
who
is
afraid
of
prayer
is
unwise
to
set
foot
beyond
the
for
the
desert
is
the
garden
of
allah
that
evening
domini
and
androvsky
spoke
to
each
other
for
the
first
time
on
the
top
of
a
tower
where
they
had
come
to
see
the
sunset
domini
spoke
first
moved
by
a
strange
look
of
loneliness
of
desolation
in
androvsky
eyes
he
replied
in
a
low
voice
and
asked
her
pardon
for
his
rude
conduct
at
the
station
then
abruptly
he
descended
the
tower
and
disappeared
at
night
she
visited
a
dancing
house
to
see
the
strange
dances
of
the
desert
she
found
androvsky
there
watching
the
painted
women
as
if
half
fascinated
half
horrified
by
them
irena
a
girl
who
had
been
banished
from
for
threatening
to
murder
an
arab
of
whom
she
was
jealous
but
had
been
permitted
to
return
discovering
him
among
the
audience
stabbed
him
there
was
a
violent
scene
during
which
androvsky
forcing
his
way
through
the
desert
men
protected
domini
from
the
crush
the
crowd
rushed
out
leaving
them
alone
together
androvsky
insisted
on
escorting
domini
back
to
the
hotel
defying
allah
in
allah
the
acquaintance
thus
unconventionally
began
between
them
continued
and
ripened
into
a
strange
friendship
domini
was
a
magnificent
horsewoman
finding
that
androvsky
did
not
know
how
to
ride
she
gave
him
lessons
together
they
galloped
over
the
desert
sands
together
they
visited
the
saharan
villages
hidden
in
the
groves
of
date
palms
behind
the
brown
earthen
walls
of
the
oasis
together
watched
the
burning
sunsets
of
africa
at
they
met
in
the
hotel
in
the
evenings
they
sat
upon
the
verandah
and
heard
the
zouaves
singing
in
chorus
the
distant
murmur
of
the
domini
became
profoundly
interested
in
androvsky
but
her
interest
was
complicated
by
wonder
at
his
peculiarities
at
his
uncouth
manners
his
strange
silences
his
ignorance
of
life
and
of
social
matters
his
distrust
of
others
his
desire
to
keep
aloof
from
all
human
beings
except
herself
the
good
priest
now
her
intimate
friend
count
anteoni
also
her
friend
and
respectful
admirer
were
ill
at
ease
with
him
he
had
tried
to
avoid
them
but
domini
anxious
to
bring
some
pleasure
into
his
life
had
introduced
him
to
them
at
a
luncheon
given
by
the
count
in
his
garden
despite
androvsky
dogged
assertion
that
he
disliked
priests
and
did
not
care
for
social
intercourse
at
this
lunch
androvsky
had
been
brusque
on
the
defensive
almost
actively
disagreeable
and
when
after
the
priest
departure
he
left
domini
alone
with
count
anteoni
she
felt
almost
relieved
count
anteoni
summoned
a
to
read
domini
fate
in
the
sand
this
man
a
thin
fanatical
eastern
with
piercing
and
cruel
eyes
spread
out
his
sand
brought
from
the
tomb
of
a
mohammedan
saint
and
prophesied
he
declared
that
he
saw
a
great
and
in
it
a
train
of
camels
waiting
by
a
church
from
the
church
came
the
sound
of
music
nearly
drowned
by
the
roar
of
the
wind
in
the
church
the
real
life
of
domini
was
beginning
the
music
ceased
darkness
fell
then
the
diviner
saw
domini
with
a
companion
mounted
on
one
of
the
camels
and
disappearing
into
the
storm
towards
the
south
the
face
of
her
companion
was
hidden
finally
he
saw
domini
far
out
in
the
desert
among
great
dunes
of
white
sand
in
her
heart
there
was
joy
it
was
as
if
all
the
date
palms
bore
their
fruit
together
and
in
all
the
desert
places
burst
forth
but
presently
a
figure
came
towards
her
walking
heavily
and
all
the
dates
shrivelled
upon
the
palms
and
all
the
springs
dried
up
sorrow
and
terror
were
there
beside
her
at
this
point
in
the
diviner
prophecy
domini
stopped
him
afterwards
she
explained
to
anteoni
that
she
felt
as
if
another
fate
was
being
read
in
it
as
well
as
her
own
as
if
to
listen
any
more
might
be
to
intrude
upon
another
secret
upon
the
following
day
anteoni
left
to
make
a
long
desert
journey
to
a
sacred
city
called
amara
domini
went
to
his
garden
at
dawn
to
see
him
off
before
departing
he
warned
domini
to
beware
of
androvsky
she
asked
him
why
he
answered
that
androvsky
seemed
to
him
a
man
who
was
at
odds
with
life
with
himself
with
his
creator
a
man
who
was
defying
allah
in
allah
garden
when
anteoni
had
gone
domini
in
some
perplexity
of
spirit
and
moved
by
a
longing
for
sympathy
and
help
visited
the
priest
in
his
house
near
the
church
the
priest
indirectly
also
warned
her
against
androvsky
and
a
little
later
frankly
told
her
that
he
felt
an
invincible
dislike
to
him
i
have
no
reason
to
give
said
the
priest
my
instinct
is
my
reason
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
say
that
i
advise
you
most
earnestly
to
break
off
your
acquaintance
with
monsieur
androvsky
domini
said
it
is
strange
ever
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
felt
as
if
everything
that
has
happened
had
been
arranged
beforehand
as
if
it
had
to
happen
and
i
feel
that
too
about
the
future
count
anteoni
fatalism
exclaimed
the
priest
it
is
the
guiding
spirit
of
this
land
and
you
too
are
going
to
be
led
by
it
take
care
you
have
come
to
a
land
of
fire
and
i
think
you
are
made
of
fire
the
warnings
of
anteoni
and
the
priest
made
an
impression
on
domini
she
was
conscious
of
how
the
outside
world
would
be
likely
to
regard
her
acquaintance
with
androvsky
suddenly
she
saw
androvsky
as
some
strange
and
ghastly
figure
of
legend
as
the
wandering
jew
met
by
a
traveller
at
cross
roads
and
distinguished
for
an
instant
by
an
oblique
flash
of
lightning
as
the
shrouded
arab
of
the
eastern
tale
who
announces
coming
disaster
to
the
wanderers
in
the
desert
by
beating
a
on
a
drum
amid
the
sands
and
she
felt
upon
her
the
heavy
hand
of
some
strange
perhaps
terrible
fate
the
eternal
song
of
that
same
night
accompanied
by
batouch
domini
rode
out
into
the
desert
to
see
the
rising
of
the
moon
and
there
met
androvsky
he
had
followed
them
on
horseback
domini
dismissed
batouch
at
androvsky
reiterated
request
when
they
were
alone
in
the
sands
androvsky
told
domini
that
he
had
needed
to
be
with
her
as
he
had
something
to
tell
her
on
the
morrow
he
was
going
away
from
his
face
while
he
said
this
was
turned
from
domini
and
his
voice
sounded
as
if
it
spoke
to
some
one
at
a
distance
some
one
who
can
hear
as
man
can
not
hear
domini
said
little
but
at
the
sound
of
his
words
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
all
outside
things
she
had
ever
known
had
foundered
as
if
with
them
had
foundered
too
all
the
bodily
powers
that
were
of
the
essence
of
her
life
and
the
desert
which
she
had
so
loved
was
no
longer
to
her
the
desert
sand
with
a
soul
in
it
blue
distances
full
of
a
music
of
summons
but
only
a
barren
waste
of
matter
featureless
desolate
ghastly
with
the
bones
of
things
that
had
died
she
rode
back
with
androvsky
to
in
a
silence
like
that
of
death
but
this
parting
decreed
by
the
man
was
not
to
be
in
the
desert
these
two
human
beings
had
grown
to
love
each
other
with
a
love
that
had
become
a
burning
passion
and
next
day
when
in
the
garden
of
count
anteoni
androvsky
came
to
say
farewell
to
domini
his
love
broke
all
barriers
he
sank
on
the
sand
letting
his
hands
slip
down
till
they
clasped
domini
knees
i
love
you
he
said
i
love
you
but
do
listen
to
me
you
hear
it
you
must
but
i
must
say
it
i
ca
go
till
i
say
it
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
am
listening
she
said
i
must
hear
it
androvsky
rose
up
put
his
hands
behind
domini
held
her
set
his
lips
on
hers
pressing
his
whole
body
against
hers
hear
it
he
said
muttering
against
her
lips
hear
it
i
love
you
i
love
you
in
the
recesses
of
the
garden
larbi
that
idle
gardener
played
upon
his
little
flute
his
eternal
song
of
love
and
from
the
desert
beyond
the
white
wall
there
rose
an
arab
voice
singing
a
song
of
the
sahara
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
heart
a
nomad
as
the
had
foretold
domini
and
androvsky
were
married
in
the
church
of
and
by
the
priest
who
had
warned
domini
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
androvsky
a
terrible
was
raging
and
the
desert
was
blotted
out
nevertheless
when
the
ceremony
was
over
the
bride
and
bridegroom
mounted
upon
a
camel
and
with
their
attendants
set
out
for
their
desert
honeymoon
standing
before
the
door
of
the
church
the
good
priest
watched
them
go
with
fear
in
his
heart
and
that
night
in
his
humble
home
kneeling
before
his
crucifix
he
prayed
long
and
earnestly
for
all
wanderers
in
the
desert
isolated
from
all
who
knew
them
free
from
all
social
ties
nomads
as
are
the
bedouins
who
make
their
dwelling
for
ever
amid
the
vast
and
burning
sands
domini
and
androvsky
entered
upon
their
married
life
and
at
first
one
of
them
was
happy
as
few
are
ever
happy
domini
loved
completely
trusted
completely
lived
with
a
fulness
a
completeness
she
had
never
known
till
now
that
androvsky
almost
worshipped
her
she
knew
his
conduct
to
her
was
perfect
and
yet
there
were
times
when
domini
felt
as
if
a
shadow
rose
between
them
as
if
even
with
her
in
some
secret
place
of
his
soul
androvsky
was
ill
at
ease
as
if
sometimes
he
suffered
and
dared
not
tell
his
suffering
one
day
in
their
wanderings
they
came
to
a
desolate
place
called
mogar
and
camped
on
a
sandhill
looking
over
a
vast
stretch
of
dunes
towards
evening
androvsky
descended
into
the
plain
to
shoot
gazelle
leaving
domini
alone
while
he
was
away
a
french
officer
with
two
men
of
the
zouaves
rode
slowly
up
they
were
nearly
starving
and
terribly
exhausted
having
been
lost
in
a
for
three
days
and
nights
pitying
their
sufferings
domini
insisted
on
entertaining
them
the
men
must
sup
with
the
arabs
the
officer
must
dine
with
herself
and
androvsky
the
officer
accepted
with
gratitude
and
went
off
to
make
his
toilet
when
androvsky
returned
domini
told
him
of
the
arrival
and
when
he
saw
the
three
places
laid
for
dinner
in
the
tent
he
seemed
profoundly
disturbed
he
asked
the
officer
name
domini
told
him
trevignac
trevignac
he
exclaimed
then
hearing
the
soldiers
coming
he
turned
away
abruptly
and
disappeared
into
the
bedroom
tent
trevignac
came
up
and
in
a
few
minutes
androvsky
reappeared
the
two
men
gazed
at
each
other
for
an
instant
then
domini
introduced
them
and
they
all
sat
down
to
dinner
conversation
was
uneasy
androvsky
was
evidently
ill
at
ease
trevignac
was
distrait
at
moments
strangely
watchful
of
his
host
at
other
moments
dinner
over
domini
left
the
two
men
together
to
smoke
and
went
out
on
to
the
sand
she
met
an
arab
carrying
coffee
and
a
liqueur
to
the
tent
what
that
ouardi
she
asked
touching
the
bottle
he
told
her
it
was
an
african
liqueur
take
it
in
she
said
and
she
strolled
away
to
the
bonfire
to
listen
to
the
fantasia
the
arabs
were
making
in
honour
of
the
soldiers
when
she
returned
to
the
tent
she
found
her
husband
alone
in
it
standing
up
with
a
quantity
of
fragments
of
glass
lying
at
his
feet
near
him
was
the
coffee
untasted
trevignac
was
gone
she
asked
for
an
explanation
he
gave
her
none
the
fragments
of
glass
were
all
that
remained
of
the
bottle
which
had
contained
the
liqueur
at
dawn
domini
met
trevignac
riding
away
with
his
soldiers
he
saluted
her
bidding
his
men
ride
on
as
he
gazed
at
her
she
seemed
to
see
horror
in
his
eyes
twice
he
tried
to
speak
but
apparently
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
he
looked
towards
the
tent
where
androvsky
was
sleeping
then
at
domini
then
as
if
moved
by
an
irresistible
impulse
he
leaned
from
his
saddle
made
over
domini
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
rode
away
into
the
desert
i
have
insulted
from
that
day
androvsky
strange
misery
of
the
soul
strange
horror
of
the
world
increased
domini
felt
that
he
was
secretly
tormented
she
tried
to
make
him
happier
she
even
told
him
that
she
believed
he
often
felt
far
away
from
god
and
that
she
prayed
each
day
for
him
boris
she
said
if
it
that
do
be
too
sad
it
may
all
come
right
in
the
desert
for
the
desert
is
the
garden
of
allah
he
made
her
no
answer
at
last
in
their
journeying
they
came
to
the
sacred
city
of
amara
and
camped
in
the
white
sands
beyond
it
this
was
the
place
described
by
the
and
here
domini
knew
that
her
love
was
to
be
crowned
that
she
would
become
a
mother
she
hesitated
to
tell
her
husband
for
in
this
place
his
misery
and
fear
of
men
seemed
mounting
to
a
climax
nevertheless
as
if
in
a
frantic
attempt
to
get
the
better
of
his
mental
torture
he
had
gone
off
saying
he
wanted
to
see
the
city
while
he
was
away
domini
was
visited
first
by
count
anteoni
who
told
her
that
he
had
joined
the
mohammedan
religion
and
was
at
last
happy
and
at
peace
secondly
when
night
had
fallen
by
the
priest
of
amara
this
man
was
talkative
and
genial
fond
of
the
good
things
of
life
domini
offered
him
a
cigar
he
accepted
it
an
arab
brought
coffee
and
the
same
african
liqueur
which
had
been
taken
to
the
tent
on
the
night
when
trevignac
had
dined
with
domini
and
androvsky
when
the
priest
was
about
to
drink
some
of
it
he
suddenly
paused
and
put
the
glass
down
domini
leant
forward
louarine
she
said
reading
the
name
on
the
bottle
wo
you
have
some
the
fact
is
madame
began
the
priest
with
hesitation
this
liqueur
comes
from
the
trappist
monastery
of
el
largani
yes
it
was
made
by
a
monk
and
priest
to
whom
the
secret
of
its
manufacture
belonged
at
his
death
he
was
to
confide
the
secret
to
another
whom
he
had
chosen
but
the
monks
of
el
largani
will
never
earn
another
franc
by
louarine
when
what
they
have
in
stock
is
exhausted
the
monk
died
suddenly
madame
he
ran
away
from
the
monastery
after
being
there
in
the
eternal
silence
for
twenty
years
after
taking
the
final
vows
how
horrible
said
domini
that
man
must
be
in
hell
now
in
the
hell
a
man
can
make
for
himself
by
his
own
act
as
she
spoke
androvsky
appeared
by
the
tent
door
he
was
looking
frightfully
ill
and
like
a
desperate
man
when
the
priest
had
gone
domini
told
androvsky
about
the
liqueur
and
the
disappearance
of
the
trappist
monk
as
she
spoke
his
face
grew
more
ghastly
he
stood
rigid
as
if
with
horror
poor
poor
man
she
said
as
she
finished
her
story
you
you
pity
that
man
then
murmured
androvsky
yes
she
replied
i
was
thinking
of
the
agony
he
must
be
enduring
if
he
is
still
alive
androvsky
seemed
painfully
moved
and
almost
as
if
he
were
on
the
verge
of
some
passionate
outburst
of
emotion
and
something
like
a
deep
voice
far
down
in
the
loving
heart
of
domini
said
to
her
if
you
really
love
be
fearless
attack
the
sorrow
which
stands
like
a
figure
of
death
between
you
and
your
husband
drive
it
away
you
have
a
weapon
faith
use
it
at
last
she
summoned
all
her
courage
all
her
faith
and
she
forced
from
androvsky
the
confession
of
what
it
was
which
held
him
in
perpetual
misery
even
in
freedom
even
with
her
whom
he
loved
beyond
and
above
all
human
beings
domini
he
said
you
want
to
know
what
it
is
that
makes
me
unhappy
even
in
our
love
desperately
unhappy
it
is
this
i
believe
in
god
i
love
god
i
have
insulted
god
i
have
tried
to
forget
god
to
deny
him
to
put
human
love
higher
than
love
for
him
but
always
i
am
haunted
by
the
thought
of
god
and
that
thought
makes
me
despair
once
when
i
was
young
i
gave
myself
to
god
solemnly
i
have
broken
the
vows
i
made
i
gave
myself
to
god
as
a
monk
you
are
the
trappist
she
whispered
you
are
the
monk
from
the
monastery
of
el
largani
who
disappeared
after
twenty
years
yes
he
said
i
am
he
standing
there
in
the
sands
while
the
world
was
wrapped
in
sleep
androvsky
told
domini
the
whole
story
of
his
life
in
the
monastery
of
his
innocent
happiness
there
and
of
the
events
which
woke
up
within
him
the
mad
longing
to
see
life
and
the
world
and
to
know
the
love
of
woman
he
told
her
of
his
secret
departure
by
night
from
the
monastery
of
his
journey
to
the
desert
in
search
of
complete
and
savage
liberty
he
told
her
how
he
had
fought
against
his
growing
love
for
her
how
he
had
tried
to
leave
her
how
at
the
last
moment
in
the
garden
by
night
his
passion
for
her
had
conquered
him
and
driven
him
to
her
feet
he
told
her
how
the
officer
trevignac
had
known
him
long
ago
in
the
monastery
and
had
recognised
him
when
the
arab
brought
in
the
liqueur
which
he
had
made
he
kept
nothing
from
her
that
last
day
in
the
garden
he
said
finally
i
thought
i
had
conquered
myself
and
it
was
in
that
moment
that
i
fell
for
ever
when
i
knew
you
loved
me
i
could
fight
no
more
you
have
seen
me
you
have
lived
with
me
you
have
divined
my
misery
but
do
think
domini
that
it
ever
came
from
you
it
was
the
consciousness
of
my
lie
to
you
my
lie
to
god
that
that
i
ca
tell
you
i
ca
tell
you
you
know
he
looked
into
her
face
then
turned
to
go
away
into
the
desert
i
go
i
go
he
muttered
then
domini
spoke
boris
she
said
he
stopped
boris
now
at
last
you
can
pray
she
went
into
the
tent
and
left
him
alone
he
knew
that
in
the
tent
she
was
praying
for
him
he
stood
trying
to
listen
to
her
prayer
then
with
an
uncertain
hand
he
felt
in
his
breast
he
drew
out
a
wooden
cross
given
to
him
by
his
mother
when
he
entered
the
monastery
he
bent
down
his
head
touched
it
with
his
lips
and
fell
upon
his
knees
in
the
desert
from
that
night
domini
realised
that
her
duty
was
plain
before
her
androvsky
was
still
at
heart
a
monk
and
she
was
a
fervently
religious
woman
she
put
god
above
herself
above
her
poor
desperate
human
love
above
androvsky
and
his
passionate
love
for
her
she
put
the
things
of
eternity
before
the
things
of
time
she
never
told
androvsky
of
the
child
that
was
coming
after
he
had
made
his
confession
to
the
priest
of
who
had
married
them
she
led
him
to
the
monastery
door
and
there
they
parted
for
ever
on
earth
to
be
reunited
as
both
believed
in
heaven
and
now
in
the
garden
of
count
anteoni
which
has
passed
into
other
hands
a
little
boy
may
often
be
seen
playing
sometimes
when
twilight
is
falling
over

sahara

her

the
white
wall
from
which
she

to
herself
the
cool
wind
of

night

over
the
vast
spaces
of

touches
her
cheek
reminding
her
of
her
glorious
days
of
liberty
of
the
passion
that
came
to
her
soul

fire
in
the
desert

the
same
lines
of
thought
as
the
former
holmes
died
on
october
the
eyes
of
elsie
bernard
langdon
duly
certificated
had
accepted
the
invitation
from
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
apollinean
female
institute
a
school
for
the
education
of
young
ladies
situated
in
the
nourishing
town
of
rockland
rockland
is
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
and
a
horrible
feature
of
this
mountain
was
the
region
known
as
rattlesnake
ledge
which
was
still
tenanted
by
those
horrible
reptiles
in
spite
of
many
a
foray
by
the
townspeople
that
the
brood
was
not
extirpated
there
was
a
melancholy
proof
in
the
year
when
a
young
married
woman
detained
at
home
by
the
state
of
her
health
was
bitten
in
the
entry
of
her
own
house
by
a
rattlesnake
which
had
found
its
way
down
from
the
mountain
owing
to
the
almost
instant
employment
of
powerful
remedies
the
bite
did
not
prove
immediately
fatal
but
she
died
within
a
few
months
of
the
time
when
she
was
bitten
it
was
on
a
fine
morning
that
langdon
made
his
appearance
as
master
for
the
english
branches
in
the
great
of
the
apollinean
institute
the
principal
silas
peckham
carried
him
to
the
desk
of
the
young
lady
assistant
miss
darley
by
name
and
introduced
him
to
her
the
young
lady
assistant
had
to
point
out
to
the
new
master
the
whole
routine
of
the
classes
and
langdon
had
a
great
many
questions
to
ask
relating
to
his
new
duties
the
truth
is
the
general
effect
of
the
with
its
scores
of
young
girls
was
enough
to
confuse
a
young
man
like
langdon
and
he
may
be
pardoned
for
asking
miss
darley
questions
about
his
scholars
as
well
as
about
their
lessons
he
asked
who
one
or
two
girls
were
and
being
answered
went
on
and
who
and
what
is
that
sitting
a
little
apart
there
that
strange
girl
the
lady
teacher
face
changed
one
would
have
said
she
was
frightened
or
troubled
the
girl
did
not
look
up
she
was
winding
a
gold
chain
about
her
wrist
and
then
uncoiling
it
as
if
in
a
kind
of
reverie
miss
darley
drew
close
to
the
master
and
placed
her
hand
so
as
to
hide
her
lips
do
look
at
her
as
if
we
were
talking
about
her
she
whispered
softly
that
is
elsie
venner
a
girl
of
about
seventeen
tall
slender
was
elsie
venner
black
piercing
eyes
black
hair
twisted
in
heavy
braids
a
face
that
one
could
not
help
looking
at
for
its
beauty
yet
that
one
wanted
to
look
away
from
and
could
not
for
those
diamond
eyes
those
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
lady
teacher
one
morning
not
long
after
langdon
arrival
miss
darley
turned
her
own
away
and
let
them
wander
over
the
other
scholars
but
the
diamond
eyes
were
on
her
still
she
turned
the
leaves
of
several
of
her
books
and
finally
following
some
impulse
which
she
could
not
resist
left
her
place
and
went
to
the
young
girl
desk
what
do
you
want
of
me
elsie
venner
it
was
a
strange
question
to
put
for
the
girl
had
not
signified
that
she
wished
the
teacher
to
come
to
her
nothing
she
cried
i
thought
i
could
make
you
come
the
girl
spoke
in
a
low
tone
a
kind
of
bernard
langdon
experienced
the
power
of
those
diamond
eyes
one
particular
day
that
summer
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
explore
the
dreaded
rattlesnake
ledge
of
the
mountain
to
examine
the
rocks
and
perhaps
to
pick
up
an
adventure
in
the
zoological
line
for
he
had
on
a
pair
of
high
stout
boots
and
he
carried
a
stick
in
his
hand
high
up
on
one
of
the
precipitous
walls
of
rock
he
saw
some
tufts
of
flowers
and
knew
them
for
flowers
elsie
venner
had
brought
into
the
presently
on
a
natural
platform
where
he
sat
down
to
rest
he
found
a
hairpin
he
rose
up
from
his
seat
to
look
round
for
other
signs
of
a
visits
and
walked
to
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
and
looked
into
it
his
look
was
met
by
the
glitter
of
two
diamond
eyes
shining
out
of
the
darkness
but
gliding
with
a
smooth
steady
motion
towards
the
light
and
himself
he
stood
fixed
struck
dumb
staring
back
into
them
with
dilating
pupils
and
sudden
numbness
of
fear
that
can
not
move
the
two
sparks
of
light
came
forward
until
they
grew
to
circles
of
flame
and
all
at
once
lifted
themselves
up
as
if
in
angry
surprise
then
for
the
first
time
thrilled
in
bernard
ears
the
dreadful
sound
that
nothing
which
breathes
can
hear
unmoved
the
long
singing
whir
as
the
huge
reptile
shook
his
rattle
he
waited
as
in
a
trance
and
while
he
looked
straight
into
the
flaming
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
losing
their
light
and
terror
that
they
were
growing
tame
and
dull
the
charm
was
dissolving
the
numbness
passing
away
he
could
move
once
more
he
heard
a
light
breathing
close
to
his
ear
and
half
turning
saw
the
face
of
elsie
venner
looking
motionless
into
the
reptile
eyes
which
had
shrunk
and
faded
under
the
stronger
enchantment
of
her
own
from
that
time
bernard
was
brought
into
new
relations
with
elsie
he
was
grateful
she
had
led
him
out
of
danger
and
perhaps
saved
him
from
death
but
he
shuddered
at
the
recollection
of
the
whole
scene
he
made
up
his
mind
that
come
what
might
he
would
solve
the
mystery
of
elsie
venner
sooner
or
later
cousin
richard
richard
venner
had
passed
several
of
his
early
years
with
his
uncle
dudley
venner
at
the
dudley
mansion
the
playmate
of
elsie
being
her
cousin
two
or
three
years
older
than
herself
his
mother
was
a
lady
of
buenos
ayres
of
spanish
descent
and
had
died
while
he
was
in
his
cradle
a
capricious
boy
he
was
a
rough
playmate
for
elsie
but
elsie
was
the
wilder
of
these
two
motherless
children
old
sophy
said
to
be
the
granddaughter
of
a
cannibal
chief
who
watched
them
in
their
play
and
their
quarrels
always
seemed
to
be
more
afraid
for
the
boy
than
the
girl
massa
dick
don
you
be
too
rough
wi
dat
girl
she
scratch
you
week
some
day
she
bite
you
if
she
bite
you
massa
dick
old
sophy
nodded
her
head
ominously
as
if
she
could
say
a
great
deal
more
elsie
father
whose
fault
was
to
indulge
her
in
everything
found
that
it
would
never
do
to
let
these
children
grow
up
together
a
sharper
quarrel
than
usual
decided
this
point
master
dick
forgot
old
caution
and
vexed
the
girl
into
a
paroxysm
of
wrath
in
which
she
sprang
at
him
and
bit
his
arm
old
kettredge
was
sent
for
and
came
at
once
when
he
heard
what
had
happened
he
had
a
good
deal
to
say
about
the
danger
there
was
from
the
teeth
of
animals
or
of
human
beings
when
enraged
and
he
emphasised
his
remarks
by
the
application
of
a
pencil
of
lunar
caustic
to
each
of
the
marks
left
by
the
sharp
white
teeth
after
this
master
dick
went
off
on
his
travels
which
led
him
into
strange
places
and
stranger
company
and
so
the
boy
grew
up
to
youth
and
early
manhood
there
came
a
time
when
the
young
gentleman
thought
he
would
like
to
see
his
cousin
again
and
wrote
inviting
himself
to
the
dudley
mansion
doctor
kettredge
could
see
no
harm
in
the
visit
when
dudley
venner
consulted
him
her
father
was
never
easy
about
elsie
he
could
not
tell
the
old
doctor
he
knew
in
god
good
time
he
believed
his
only
daughter
would
come
to
her
true
nature
her
eyes
would
lose
that
frightful
cold
glitter
and
that
faint
which
encircled
her
neck
her
mother
swooned
when
she
first
saw
it
would
fade
wholly
out
let
her
go
to
the
girls
school
by
all
means
the
doctor
had
said
when
that
was
first
talked
about
anything
to
interest
her
friendship
love
religion
whatever
will
set
her
nature
to
work
when
dudley
venner
mentioned
his
nephew
arrival
the
doctor
only
said
let
him
stay
a
while
it
gives
her
something
to
think
about
he
thought
there
was
no
danger
of
any
sudden
passion
springing
up
between
two
such
young
persons
so
richard
came
and
the
longer
he
stayed
the
more
favourably
the
idea
of
a
permanent
residence
in
the
seemed
to
impress
him
the
estate
was
large
and
of
great
value
and
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
that
the
property
had
largely
increased
it
was
evident
there
was
an
abundant
income
and
cousin
elsie
was
worth
trying
for
on
the
other
hand
what
was
the
matter
with
her
eyes
that
they
sucked
your
life
out
of
you
in
that
strange
way
and
what
did
she
always
wear
a
necklace
for
besides
her
father
might
last
for
ever
or
take
it
into
his
head
to
marry
again
he
prolonged
his
visit
until
his
presence
became
something
like
a
matter
of
habit
in
the
meantime
he
found
that
elsie
was
getting
more
constant
in
her
attendance
at
school
and
learned
on
inquiry
that
there
was
a
new
master
a
handsome
young
man
the
handsome
young
man
would
not
have
liked
the
look
that
came
over
dick
venner
face
when
he
heard
this
fact
mentioned
for
richard
had
decided
that
he
must
have
the
property
that
this
was
his
one
great
chance
in
life
the
girl
might
not
suit
him
as
a
wife
possibly
time
enough
to
find
out
after
he
had
got
her
that
elsie
now
regarded
him
with
indifference
if
not
aversion
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
the
young
man
at
the
school
was
probably
at
the
bottom
of
it
cousin
elsie
in
love
with
a
yankee
schoolmaster
but
for
a
long
time
dick
venner
could
get
no
positive
evidence
of
any
sentiment
between
elsie
and
the
schoolmaster
at
one
time
he
would
be
devoured
by
suspicion
at
another
he
would
laugh
himself
out
of
them
his
jealousy
at
last
broke
out
when
he
and
elsie
were
alone
in
a
questioning
reference
to
langdon
elsie
coloured
and
then
answered
abruptly
and
scornfully
langdon
is
a
gentleman
and
would
not
vex
me
as
you
do
a
gentleman
dick
answered
with
the
most
insulting
accent
a
gentleman
come
elsie
you
got
the
dudley
blood
in
your
veins
and
it
does
do
for
you
to
call
this
poor
sneaking
schoolmaster
a
gentleman
he
stopped
short
elsie
bosom
was
heaving
the
faint
flush
of
her
cheek
was
becoming
a
vivid
glow
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
in
his
mind
elsie
venner
loved
bernard
langdon
the
sudden
conviction
absolute
overwhelming
rushed
upon
him
elsie
made
no
answer
but
glided
out
of
the
room
and
slid
away
to
her
own
apartment
she
bolted
the
door
and
drew
her
curtains
close
then
she
threw
herself
on
the
floor
and
fell
into
a
dull
slow
ache
of
passion
without
tears
almost
without
words
dick
realised
that
he
had
reached
a
fearful
point
he
could
not
give
up
the
great
dudley
property
therefore
the
must
be
got
rid
of
and
by
bernard
langdon
must
be
found
suspended
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
somewhat
within
a
mile
of
the
apollinean
institute
the
perilous
old
doctor
kettredge
had
advised
bernard
langdon
to
go
in
for
shooting
and
had
even
presented
him
with
a
small
beautifully
finished
revolver
i
want
you
to
carry
this
he
said
and
more
than
that
i
want
you
to
practise
with
it
often
so
that
it
may
be
seen
and
understood
that
you
are
apt
to
have
a
pistol
about
you
this
was
at
the
conclusion
of
a
conversation
between
the
doctor
and
bernard
concerning
elsie
venner
elsie
interests
me
said
the
young
man
interests
me
strangely
i
would
risk
my
life
for
her
but
i
do
not
love
her
if
her
hand
touches
mine
it
is
not
a
thrill
of
passion
i
feel
running
through
me
but
a
very
different
emotion
langdon
said
the
doctor
you
have
come
to
this
country
town
without
suspicion
and
you
are
moving
in
the
midst
of
perils
keep
your
eyes
open
and
your
heart
shut
if
through
pitying
that
girl
you
ever
come
to
love
her
you
are
lost
if
you
deal
carelessly
with
her
beware
this
is
not
all
there
are
other
eyes
on
you
beside
elsie
venner
go
armed
in
future
bernard
thought
the
advice
very
odd
but
he
followed
it
and
soon
became
known
as
an
expert
at
on
the
day
when
dick
venner
had
decided
that
the
schoolmaster
must
be
found
hanged
bernard
langdon
went
out
as
usual
for
the
evening
walk
he
thrust
his
pistol
which
he
had
put
away
loaded
into
his
pocket
before
starting
the
moon
was
shining
at
intervals
for
the
night
was
partially
clouded
there
seemed
to
be
nobody
stirring
but
presently
he
detected
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
looking
forward
saw
a
horseman
coming
in
his
direction
when
the
horseman
was
within
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
him
the
moon
shone
out
suddenly
and
revealed
each
of
them
to
the
other
the
rider
paused
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
put
his
horse
to
the
full
gallop
and
dashed
towards
him
rising
at
the
same
instant
in
his
stirrups
and
swinging
something
round
his
head
it
was
a
strange
manoeuvre
so
strange
and
threatening
that
the
young
man
cocked
his
pistol
and
waited
to
see
what
mischief
all
this
meant
he
did
not
wait
long
as
the
rider
came
rushing
towards
him
he
made
a
rapid
motion
and
something
leaped
feet
through
the
air
in
bernard
direction
in
an
instant
he
felt
a
ring
as
of
a
rope
or
thong
settle
upon
his
shoulders
there
was
no
time
to
think
he
would
be
lost
in
another
second
he
raised
his
pistol
and
fired
not
at
the
rider
but
at
the
horse
his
aim
was
true
the
horse
gave
one
bound
and
fell
lifeless
shot
through
the
head
the
lasso
was
fastened
to
his
saddle
and
his
last
bound
threw
bernard
violently
to
the
earth
where
he
lay
motionless
as
if
stunned
in
the
meantime
dick
venner
who
had
been
dashed
down
with
his
horse
was
trying
to
extricate
himself
one
of
his
legs
was
held
fast
under
the
animal
the
long
spur
on
his
boot
having
caught
in
the
he
found
however
that
he
could
do
nothing
with
his
right
arm
his
shoulder
having
been
in
some
way
injured
in
his
fall
but
his
southern
blood
was
up
and
as
he
saw
bernard
move
as
if
he
were
coming
to
his
senses
he
struggled
violently
to
free
himself
i
have
the
dog
yet
he
said
only
let
me
get
at
him
with
the
knife
he
had
just
succeeded
in
extricating
his
imprisoned
leg
and
was
ready
to
spring
to
his
feet
when
he
was
caught
firmly
by
the
throat
and
looking
up
saw
a
hayfork
within
an
inch
of
his
breast
hold
on
there
thunder
y
abaout
y
darned
portagee
said
a
sharp
resolute
voice
dick
looked
from
the
weapon
to
the
person
who
held
it
and
saw
abel
stebbins
the
doctor
man
standing
over
him
let
me
up
let
me
up
he
cried
in
a
low
hurried
voice
i
give
you
a
hundred
dollars
in
gold
to
let
me
go
the
man
hurt
do
you
see
him
stirring
he
come
to
himself
in
two
minutes
let
me
up
give
you
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
gold
now
here
on
the
spot
and
the
watch
out
of
my
pocket
take
it
yourself
with
your
own
hands
ketch
me
go
was
abel
emphatic
answer
bernard
was
now
getting
first
his
senses
and
then
some
few
of
his
scattered
wits
together
who
hurt
what
happened
he
asked
staring
about
him
then
he
felt
something
about
his
neck
and
putting
his
hands
up
found
the
loop
of
the
lasso
abel
quickly
slipped
the
noose
over
head
and
put
it
round
the
neck
of
the
miserable
dick
venner
who
with
his
disabled
arm
felt
resistance
was
hopeless
the
party
now
took
up
the
line
of
march
for
old
kettredge
house
abel
carrying
langdon
pistol
and
leading
dick
venner
bernard
langdon
holding
the
hayfork
he
was
still
and
felt
it
was
all
a
dream
when
they
reached
the
house
my
mind
is
confused
he
told
the
doctor
i
had
a
fall
sit
down
sit
down
the
doctor
said
abel
will
tell
me
about
it
slight
concussion
of
the
brain
ca
remember
very
well
for
an
hour
or
two
will
come
right
by
dick
venner
shoulder
was
out
of
joint
the
doctor
found
he
replaced
it
in
a
very
few
minutes
that
night
the
doctor
drove
dick
forty
miles
at
a
stretch
out
of
the
limits
of
the
state
he
had
implored
them
to
let
him
go
and
bernard
was
quite
willing
that
no
further
proceedings
should
be
taken
the
secret
is
a
week
after
dick
venner
departure
elsie
went
off
at
the
accustomed
hour
to
the
school
she
had
none
of
the
hard
wicked
light
in
her
eyes
that
morning
and
looked
gentle
but
dreamy
at
the
end
of
the
school
hours
when
the
girls
had
all
gone
out
elsie
came
up
to
bernard
and
said
in
a
very
low
voice
will
you
walk
towards
my
home
with
me
so
they
walked
along
together
on
their
way
towards
the
dudley
mansion
i
have
no
friend
elsie
said
all
at
once
nobody
loves
me
but
one
old
woman
old
sophy
i
am
your
friend
elsie
tell
me
what
i
can
do
to
render
your
life
happier
love
me
said
elsie
venner
bernard
turned
pale
elsie
he
said
presently
i
do
love
you
as
a
sister
with
sorrows
of
her
own
as
one
whom
i
would
save
at
the
risk
of
my
happiness
and
life
give
me
your
hand
dear
elsie
and
trust
me
that
i
will
be
as
true
a
friend
to
you
as
if
we
were
children
of
the
same
mother
elsie
gave
him
her
hand
mechanically
and
he
pressed
it
gently
they
walked
almost
in
silence
the
rest
of
the
way
it
was
all
over
with
poor
elsie
she
went
at
once
to
her
own
room
when
they
reached
the
and
never
left
it
they
sent
for
the
old
doctor
and
he
ordered
some
remedies
saying
he
would
call
the
next
day
hoping
to
find
her
better
but
the
next
day
came
and
the
next
and
still
elsie
was
on
her
bed
feverish
restless
and
silent
send
me
helen
darley
she
said
at
last
on
the
fourth
day
and
helen
came
dudley
venner
followed
her
into
the
room
she
is
your
patient
he
said
except
while
the
doctor
is
here
helen
darley
often
tried
in
those
days
and
nights
when
she
sat
by
elsie
bed
to
enter
into
the
sick
girl
confidence
and
affections
but
there
was
always
something
that
seemed
inexplicable
in
the
changes
of
mood
so
helen
determined
to
ask
old
sophy
some
questions
how
old
is
elsie
eighteen
years
this
las
september
how
long
ago
did
her
mother
die
eighteen
year
ago
this
october
helen
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
whispered
what
did
her
mother
die
of
sophy
the
old
woman
caught
helen
by
the
hand
and
clung
to
it
as
if
in
fear
do
never
speak
in
this
house
what
elsie
mother
died
of
she
said
god
has
made
ugly
things
wi
death
in
their
mouths
miss
darlin
an
he
knows
what
they
for
but
my
poor
elsie
to
have
her
blood
changed
in
her
before
it
was
in
july
mistress
got
her
death
but
she
liv
till
three
week
after
my
poor
elsie
was
born
she
could
speak
no
more
she
had
said
enough
helen
remembered
the
stories
she
had
heard
on
coming
to
the
village
now
she
knew
the
secret
of
the
fascination
which
looked
out
of
the
cold
glittering
eyes
a
great
change
came
over
elsie
in
the
last
few
days
it
seemed
to
her
father
as
if
the
malign
influence
which
had
pervaded
her
being
had
been
driven
forth
or
exorcised
it
her
mother
look
said
old
sophy
it
her
mother
own
face
right
over
again
she
never
look
so
before
the
lord
hand
is
on
her
his
will
be
done
but
elsie
heart
was
beating
more
feebly
every
day
one
night
with
sudden
effort
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
father
neck
kissed
him
and
said
my
dear
father
then
her
head
fell
back
upon
her
pillow
and
a
long
sigh
breathed
through
her
lips
elsie

tom
brown
schooldays
has
been
called
by
more
than
one
critic
the
best
story
of
schoolboy
life
ever
written
and
three
generations
of
readers
have
endorsed
the
opinion
its
author
thomas
hughes
born
at
uffington
berkshire
england
was
himself
like
his
hero
both
a
rugby
boy
under
arnold
and
the
son
of
a
berkshire
squire
but
he
denied
that
the
story
was
in
any
real
sense
autobiographical
matthew
arnold
and
arthur
clough
the
poet
were
friends
at
school
and
in
later
life
he
became
associated
with
charles
kingsley
and
frederick
denison
maurice
on
what
was
called
the
christian
socialist
movement
a
barrister
by
profession
thomas

became
a
county
court
judge
and
lived
for
many
years
in
that
capacity
at
chester
besides
tom

published
in

also
wrote
tom
brown
at
oxford
biographies
of
livingstone
bishop
fraser
and
daniel
macmillan
and
a
number
of
political
religious
and
social
pamphlets
he
died
on
march
tom
goes
to
squire
brown
for
the
county
of
berks
dealt
out
justice
and
mercy
in
a
thorough
way
and
begat
sons
and
daughters
and
hunted
the
fox
and
grumbled
at
the
badness
of
the
roads
and
the
times
and
his
wife
dealt
out
stockings
and
shirts
and
smock
frocks
and
comforting
drinks
to
the
old
folks
with
the
rheumatiz
and
good
counsel
to
all
tom
was
their
eldest
child
a
hearty
strong
boy
from
the
first
given
to
fighting
with
and
escaping
from
his
nurse
and
fraternising
with
all
the
village
boys
with
whom
he
made
expeditions
all
round
the
neighbourhood
squire
brown
was
a
tory
to
the
backbone
but
nevertheless
held
divers
social
principles
not
generally
supposed
to
be
true
blue
in
colour
the
foremost
of
which
was
the
belief
that
a
man
is
to
be
valued
wholly
and
solely
for
that
which
he
is
himself
apart
from
all
externals
whatever
therefore
he
held
it
did
matter
a
straw
whether
his
son
associated
with
lords
sons
or
ploughmen
sons
provided
they
were
brave
and
honest
so
he
encouraged
tom
in
his
intimacy
with
the
village
boys
and
gave
them
the
run
of
a
close
for
a
playground
great
was
the
grief
among
them
when
tom
drove
off
with
the
squire
one
morning
to
meet
the
coach
on
his
way
to
rugby
to
school
it
had
been
resolved
that
tom
should
travel
down
by
the
which
passed
through
rugby
itself
and
as
it
was
an
early
coach
they
drove
out
to
the
peacock
inn
at
islington
to
be
on
the
road
towards
nine
the
squire
observing
that
tom
was
getting
sleepy
sent
the
little
fellow
off
to
bed
with
a
few
parting
words
the
result
of
much
thought
and
now
tom
my
boy
said
the
squire
remember
you
are
going
at
your
own
earnest
request
to
be
chucked
into
this
great
school
like
a
young
bear
with
all
your
troubles
before
you
earlier
than
we
should
have
sent
you
perhaps
you
see
a
great
many
cruel
blackguard
things
done
and
hear
a
deal
of
foul
bad
talk
but
never
fear
you
tell
the
truth
and
keep
a
brave
kind
heart
and
never
listen
to
or
say
anything
you
would
have
your
mother
or
sister
hear
and
you
never
feel
ashamed
to
come
home
or
we
to
see
you
the
mention
of
his
mother
made
tom
feel
rather
choky
and
he
would
have
liked
to
hug
his
father
well
if
it
had
been
for
his
recent
stipulation
that
kissing
should
now
cease
between
them
so
he
only
squeezed
his
father
hand
and
looked
up
bravely
and
said
i
try
father
at
ten
minutes
to
three
tom
was
in
the
in
his
stockings
and
there
was
his
father
nursing
a
bright
fire
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
hard
biscuit
on
the
table
just
as
he
was
swallowing
the
last
mouthful
boots
looks
in
and
says
sir
and
they
hear
the
ring
and
rattle
as
it
dashes
up
to
the
peacock
father
my
love
at
home
a
last
shake
of
the
hand
up
goes
tom
the
guard
holding
on
with
one
hand
while
he
claps
the
horn
to
his
mouth
toot
toot
toot
away
goes
the
into
the
darkness
tom
stands
up
and
looks
back
at
his
father
figure
as
long
as
you
can
see
it
and
then
comes
to
an
anchor
and
finishes
his
buttonings
and
other
preparations
for
facing
the
cold
three
hours
before
dawn
the
guard
muffles
tom
feet
up
in
straw
and
puts
an
over
his
knees
but
it
is
not
until
after
breakfast
that
his
tongue
is
unloosed
and
he
rubs
up
his
memory
and
launches
out
into
a
graphic
history
of
all
the
performances
of
the
rugby
boys
on
the
roads
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
so
here
rugby
sir
at
last
and
you
be
in
plenty
of
time
for
dinner
at
the
schoolhouse
as
i
tell
you
says
the
old
guard
tom
heart
beat
quick
and
he
began
to
feel
proud
of
being
a
rugby
boy
when
he
passed
the
school
gates
and
saw
the
boys
standing
there
as
if
the
town
belonged
to
them
one
of
the
young
heroes
ran
out
from
the
rest
and
scrambled
up
behind
where
having
righted
himself
with
how
do
jem
to
the
guard
he
turned
round
short
to
tom
and
began
i
say
you
fellow
is
your
name
brown
yes
said
tom
in
considerable
astonishment
ah
i
thought
so
my
old
aunt
miss
east
lives
somewhere
down
your
way
in
berkshire
she
wrote
that
you
were
coming
and
asked
me
to
give
you
a
lift
tom
was
somewhat
inclined
to
resent
the
patronising
air
of
his
new
friend
a
boy
of
just
about
his
own
age
and
height
but
gifted
with
the
most
transcendent
coolness
and
assurance
which
tom
felt
to
be
aggravating
and
hard
to
bear
but
could
help
admiring
and
envying
especially
when
my
young
lord
begins
hectoring
two
or
three
long
loafing
fellows
and
arranges
with
one
of
them
to
carry
up
tom
luggage
you
see
said
east
as
they
strolled
up
to
the
school
gates
a
good
deal
depends
on
how
a
fellow
cuts
up
at
first
you
see
i
doing
the
handsome
thing
by
you
because
my
father
knows
yours
besides
i
want
to
please
the
old
lady
she
gave
me
this
half
and
double
it
next
if
i
keep
in
her
good
books
tom
was
duly
placed
in
the
third
form
and
found
his
work
very
easy
and
as
he
had
no
intimate
companion
to
make
him
idle
east
being
in
the
lower
fourth
soon
gained
golden
opinions
from
his
master
and
all
went
well
with
him
in
the
school
as
a
new
boy
he
was
of
course
excused
fagging
but
in
his
enthusiasm
this
hardly
pleased
him
and
east
and
others
of
his
young
friends
kindly
allowed
him
to
indulge
his
fancy
and
take
their
turns
at
night
fagging
and
cleaning
studies
so
he
soon
gained
the
character
of
a
willing
fellow
ready
to
do
a
turn
for
anyone
the
war
of
the
lower
fourth
was
an
overgrown
form
too
large
for
any
one
man
to
attend
to
properly
consequently
the
elysium
of
the
young
scamps
who
formed
the
staple
of
it
tom
had
come
up
from
the
third
with
a
good
character
but
he
rapidly
fell
away
and
became
as
unmanageable
as
the
rest
by
the
time
the
second
monthly
examination
came
round
his
character
for
steadiness
was
gone
and
for
years
after
he
went
up
the
school
without
it
and
regarded
the
masters
as
a
matter
of
course
as
his
natural
enemies
matters
were
not
so
comfortable
in
the
house
either
the
new
praeposters
of
the
sixth
form
were
not
strong
and
the
big
fifth
form
boys
soon
began
to
usurp
power
and
to
fag
and
bully
the
little
boys
one
evening
tom
and
east
were
sitting
in
their
study
tom
brooding
over
the
wrongs
of
fags
in
general
and
his
own
in
particular
i
say
scud
said
he
at
last
what
right
have
the
fifth
form
boys
to
fag
us
as
they
do
no
more
right
than
you
have
to
fag
them
said
east
without
looking
up
from
an
early
number
of
pickwick
tom
relapsed
into
his
brown
study
and
east
went
on
reading
and
chuckling
do
you
know
old
fellow
i
been
thinking
it
over
and
i
made
up
my
mind
i
wo
fag
except
for
the
sixth
quite
right
too
my
boy
cried
east
i
all
for
a
strike
myself
it
getting
too
bad
i
should
mind
if
it
were
only
young
brooke
now
said
tom
i
do
anything
for
him
but
that
blackguard
flashman
the
cowardly
brute
broke
in
east
sounded
along
the
passage
from
flashman
study
the
two
boys
looked
at
one
another
again
no
answer
here
brown
east
you
young
skulks
roared
flashman
i
know
in
no
shirking
tom
bolted
the
door
and
east
blew
out
the
candle
now
tom
no
surrender
then
the
assault
commenced
one
panel
of
the
door
gave
way
to
repeated
kicks
and
the
besieged
strengthened
their
defences
with
the
sofa
flashman
at
last
retired
vowing
vengeance
and
when
the
convivial
noises
began
again
steadily
tom
and
east
rushed
out
they
were
too
quick
to
be
caught
but
a
sent
whizzing
after
them
by
flashman
narrowly
missed
tom
head
their
story
was
soon
told
to
a
knot
of
small
boys
round
the
fire
in
the
hall
who
nearly
all
bound
themselves
not
to
fag
for
the
fifth
encouraged
and
advised
thereto
by
diggs
a
queer
very
clever
fellow
nearly
at
the
top
of
the
fifth
himself
he
stood
by
them
all
through
and
seldom
have
small
boys
had
more
need
of
a
friend
flashman
and
his
associates
united
in
bringing
the
young
vagabonds
to
their
senses
and
the
whole
house
was
filled
with
chasings
sieges
and
lickings
of
all
sorts
one
evening
in
forbidden
hours
brown
and
east
were
in
the
hall
chatting
by
the
light
of
the
fire
when
the
door
swung
open
and
in
walked
flashman
he
did
see
diggs
busy
in
front
of
the
other
fire
and
as
the
boys
did
move
for
him
struck
one
of
them
and
ordered
them
all
off
to
their
study
i
say
you
two
said
diggs
rousing
up
you
never
get
rid
of
that
fellow
till
you
lick
him
go
in
at
him
both
of
you
i
see
fair
play
they
were
about
up
to
flashman
shoulder
but
tough
and
in
perfect
training
while
he
seventeen
years
old
and
big
and
strong
of
his
age
was
in
poor
condition
from
his
monstrous
habits
of
stuffing
and
want
of
exercise
they
rushed
in
on
him
and
he
hit
out
wildly
and
savagely
and
in
another
minute
tom
went
spinning
backwards
over
a
form
and
flashman
turned
to
demolish
east
with
a
savage
grin
but
diggs
jumped
down
from
the
table
on
which
he
had
seated
himself
stop
there
shouted
he
the
round
over
half
minute
time
allowed
i
going
to
see
fair
are
you
ready
brown
time
up
the
small
boys
rushed
in
again
flashman
was
wilder
and
more
flurried
than
ever
in
a
few
moments
over
all
three
went
on
the
floor
flashman
striking
his
head
on
a
form
but
his
skull
was
not
fractured
as
the
two
youngsters
feared
it
was
and
he
never
laid
a
finger
on
them
again
but
whatever
harm
a
spiteful
tongue
could
do
them
he
took
care
should
be
done
only
throw
dirt
enough
and
some
will
stick
and
so
tom
and
east
and
one
or
two
more
became
a
sort
of
young
ishmaelites
they
saw
the
praeposters
cowed
by
or
joining
with
the
fifth
and
shirking
their
own
duties
and
so
they
did
respect
them
and
rendered
no
willing
obedience
and
got
the
character
of
sulky
unwilling
fags
at
the
end
of
the
term
they
are
told
the
doctor
wants
to
see
them
he
is
not
angry
only
very
grave
he
explains
that
rules
are
made
for
the
good
of
the
school
and
must
and
shall
be
obeyed
he
should
be
sorry
if
they
had
to
leave
and
wishes
them
to
think
very
seriously
in
the
holidays
over
what
he
has
said
the
turn
of
the
the
turning
point
of
our
hero
school
career
had
now
come
and
the
manner
of
it
was
as
follows
tom
and
east
and
another
schoolhouse
boy
rushed
into
the
matron
room
in
high
spirits
when
they
got
back
on
the
first
day
of
the
next
she
sent
off
the
others
but
kept
tom
to
tell
him
arnold
wished
him
to
take
a
new
boy
to
share
the
study
he
had
hoped
to
share
with
east
she
had
told
arnold
she
thought
tom
would
be
kind
to
him
and
see
that
he
was
bullied
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
he
saw
a
slight
pale
boy
who
looked
ready
to
sink
through
the
floor
the
matron
watched
tom
for
a
minute
and
saw
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
poor
little
fellow
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
his
father
dead
and
his
mamma
such
a
sweet
kind
lady
almost
broke
her
heart
at
leaving
him
she
said
one
of
his
sisters
was
like
to
die
of
a
decline
well
well
burst
in
tom
i
suppose
i
must
give
up
east
come
along
young
what
your
name
we
go
and
have
supper
and
then
show
you
our
study
his
name
george
arthur
said
the
matron
i
had
his
books
and
things
put
into
the
study
which
his
mamma
has
had
new
papered
and
the
sofa
covered
and
new
curtains
and
arnold
told
me
to
say
like
you
both
to
come
up
to
tea
with
her
here
was
an
announcement
for
master
tom
he
was
to
go
up
to
tea
the
first
night
just
as
if
he
were
of
importance
in
the
school
world
instead
of
the
most
reckless
young
scapegrace
among
the
fags
he
felt
himself
lifted
on
to
a
higher
moral
platform
at
once
and
marched
off
with
his
young
charge
in
tow
in
monstrous
good
humour
with
himself
and
all
the
world
his
cup
was
full
when
arnold
with
a
warm
shake
of
the
hand
seemingly
oblivious
of
all
the
scrapes
he
had
been
getting
into
said
ah
brown
you
here
i
hope
you
left
all
well
at
home
and
this
is
the
little
fellow
who
is
to
share
your
study
well
he
look
as
we
should
like
to
see
him
you
must
take
him
some
good
long
walks
and
show
him
what
little
pretty
country
we
have
about
here
the
tea
went
merrily
off
and
everybody
felt
that
he
young
as
he
was
was
of
some
use
in
the
school
world
and
had
a
work
to
do
there
when
tom
was
recognised
coming
out
of
the
private
door
which
led
from
the
doctor
house
there
was
a
great
shout
of
greeting
and
hall
at
once
began
to
question
arthur
what
a
queer
chum
for
tom
brown
was
the
general
comment
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
so
thought
tom
himself
as
he
lighted
the
candle
in
their
study
and
surveyed
the
new
curtains
with
much
satisfaction
i
say
arthur
what
a
brick
your
mother
is
to
make
us
so
cosy
but
look
here
now
you
must
answer
straight
up
when
the
fellows
speak
to
you
if
you
afraid
you
get
bullied
and
do
you
ever
talk
about
home
or
your
mother
or
sisters
poor
little
arthur
looked
ready
to
cry
but
please
may
i
talk
about
home
to
you
oh
yes
i
like
it
but
not
to
boys
you
do
know
what
a
jolly
desk
and
soon
tom
was
deep
in
arthur
goods
and
chattels
and
hardly
thought
of
his
friends
outside
till
the
rang
he
thought
of
his
own
first
night
there
when
he
was
leading
poor
little
arthur
up
to
no
and
showing
him
his
bed
the
idea
of
sleeping
in
a
room
with
strange
boys
had
clearly
never
crossed
his
mind
before
he
could
hardly
bare
to
take
his
jacket
off
however
presently
off
it
came
and
he
paused
and
looked
at
tom
who
was
sitting
on
his
bed
talking
and
laughing
please
brown
he
whispered
may
i
wash
my
face
and
hands
of
course
if
you
like
said
tom
staring
you
have
to
go
down
for
more
water
if
you
use
it
all
on
went
the
talk
and
laughter
arthur
finished
his
undressing
and
looked
round
more
nervously
than
ever
the
light
burned
clear
the
noise
went
on
this
time
however
he
did
not
ask
tom
what
he
might
or
might
not
do
but
dropped
on
his
knees
by
his
bedside
to
open
his
heart
to
him
who
heareth
the
cry
of
the
tender
child
or
the
strong
man
tom
was
unlacing
his
boots
with
his
back
towards
arthur
and
looked
up
in
wonder
at
the
sudden
silence
then
two
or
three
boys
laughed
and
one
big
brutal
fellow
picked
up
a
slipper
and
shied
it
at
the
kneeling
boy
the
next
moment
the
boot
tom
had
just
taken
off
flew
straight
at
the
head
of
the
bully
if
any
other
fellow
wants
the
other
boot
said
tom
stepping
on
to
the
floor
he
knows
how
to
get
it
at
this
moment
the
sixth
form
boy
came
in
and
not
another
word
could
be
said
tom
and
the
rest
rushed
into
bed
and
finished
unrobing
there
sleep
seemed
to
have
deserted
the
pillow
of
poor
tom
the
thought
of
his
promise
to
his
mother
came
over
him
never
to
forget
to
kneel
at
his
bedside
and
give
himself
up
to
his
father
before
he
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
from
which
it
might
never
rise
and
he
lay
down
gently
and
cried
as
if
his
heart
would
break
he
was
only
fourteen
years
old
next
morning
he
was
up
and
washed
and
dressed
just
as
the
bell
began
and
then
in
the
face
of
the
whole
room
knelt
down
to
pray
not
five
words
could
he
say
he
was
listening
for
every
whisper
in
the
room
what
were
they
all
thinking
of
him
at
last
as
it
were
from
his
inmost
heart
a
still
small
voice
seemed
to
breathe
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
he
repeated
the
words
over
and
over
again
and
rose
from
his
knees
comforted
and
humbled
and
ready
to
face
the
whole
school
it
was
not
needed
two
other
boys
had
already
followed
his
example
before
either
tom
or
arthur
left
the
schoolhouse
there
was
no
room
in
which
it
had
not
become
the
regular
custom
tom
brown
last
the
curtain
now
rises
on
the
last
act
of
our
little
drama
eight
years
have
passed
and
it
is
the
end
of
the
summer
at
rugby
the
boys
have
scattered
to
the
four
winds
except
the
eleven
and
a
few
enthusiasts
who
are
permitted
to
stay
to
see
the
result
of
the
cricket
matches
for
this
year
the
return
matches
are
being
played
at
rugby
and
the
great
event
of
the
year
the
marylebone
match
is
being
played
i
wish
i
had
space
to
describe
the
whole
match
but
i
have
so
you
must
fancy
it
all
and
let
me
beg
to
call
your
attention
to
a
group
of
three
eagerly
watching
the
match
the
first
evidently
a
clergyman
is
carelessly
dressed
and
looks
rather
used
up
but
is
bent
on
enjoying
life
as
he
spreads
himself
out
in
the
evening
sun
by
his
side
in
white
flannel
shirt
and
trousers
and
the
captain
belt
sits
a
strapping
figure
near
six
feet
high
with
ruddy
tanned
face
and
a
laughing
eye
he
is
leaning
forward
dandling
his
favourite
bat
with
which
he
has
made
thirty
or
forty
runs
it
is
tom
brown
spending
his
last
day
as
a
rugby
boy
and
at
their
feet
sits
arthur
with
his
bat
across
his
knees
he
is
less
of
a
boy
in
fact
than
tom
if
one
may
judge
by
the
thoughtfulness
of
his
face
which
is
somewhat
paler
than
we
could
wish
but
his
figure
is
and
active
and
all
his
old
timidity
has
disappeared
and
is
replaced
by
silent
quaint
fun
as
he
listens
to
the
broken
talk
and
joins
in
every
now
and
then
presently
he
goes
off
to
the
wicket
with
a
last
exhortation
from
tom
to
play
steady
and
keep
his
bat
straight
i
surprised
to
see
arthur
in
the
eleven
says
the
master
well
i
not
sure
he
ought
to
be
for
his
play
said
tom
but
i
could
help
putting
him
in
it
will
do
him
so
much
good
and
you
think
what
i
owe
him
the
master
smiled
later
he
returned
to
the
subject
nothing
has
given
me
greater
pleasure
he
said
than
your
friendship
for
him
it
has
been
the
making
of
you
both
of
me
at
any
rate
answered
tom
it
was
the
luckiest
chance
in
the
world
that
sent
him
to
rugby
and
made
him
my
chum
there
was
neither
luck
nor
chance
in
that
matter
said
the
master
do
you
remember
when
the
doctor
lectured
you
and
east
when
you
had
been
getting
into
all
sorts
of
scrapes
yes
well
enough
said
tom
it
was
the
before
arthur
came
exactly
so
said
the
master
he
was
in
great
distress
about
you
both
and
after
some
talk
we
both
agreed
that
you
in
particular
wanted
some
object
in
the
school
beyond
games
and
mischief
so
the
doctor
looked
out
the
best
of
the
new
boys
and
separated
you
and
east
in
the
hope
that
when
you
had
somebody
to
lean
on
you
you
be
steadier
yourself
and
get
manliness
and
thoughtfulness
he
has
watched
the
experiment
ever
since
with
great
satisfaction
up
to
this
time
tom
had
never
fully
given
in
to
or
understood
the
doctor
he
had
learnt
to
regard
him
with
love
and
respect
and
to
think
him
a
very
great
and
wise
and
good
man
but
as
regarded
his
own
position
in
the
school
he
had
no
idea
of
giving
anyone
credit
but
himself
it
was
a
new
light
to
tom
to
find
that
besides
teaching
the
sixth
and
governing
and
guiding
the
whole
school
editing
classics
and
writing
histories
the
great
headmaster
had
found
time
to
watch
over
the
career
even
of
him
tom
brown
and
his
particular
friends
however
the
doctor
victory
was
complete
from
that
moment
it
had
taken
eight
long
years
to
do
it
but
now
it
was
done
thoroughly
the
match
was
over
tom
said
to
his
tutor
and
marched
down
to
the
schoolhouse
next
morning
he
was
in
the
train
and
away
for
london
no
longer
a
schoolboy
tom
brown
at
oxford
tom
brown
at
oxford
a
continuation
of
tom
schooldays
was
published
in
but
like
most
sequels
it
failed
to
achieve
the
wide
popularity
of
its
famous
predecessor
although
the
story
perhaps
lacks
much
of
the
freshness
of
the
schooldays
it
nevertheless
conveys
an
admirable
picture
of
undergraduate
life
as
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
notwithstanding
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
since
then
it
is
still
remarkably
full
of
vitality
and
the
description
of
the
boat
races
and
the
bumping
of
exeter
and
oriel
by
ambrose
boat
might
well
have
been
written
in
spite
of
its
defects
the
story
with
its
vigorous
morals
is
worthy
to
rank
with
anything
that
came
from
the
pen
of
tom
hughes
the
great
apostle
of
muscular
christianity
st
ambrose
in
the
michaelmas
term
after
leaving
school
tom
went
up
to
matriculate
at
ambrose
college
oxford
but
did
not
go
up
to
reside
till
the
following
january
ambrose
college
was
a
one
there
were
some
seventy
or
eighty
undergraduates
in
residence
when
our
hero
appeared
there
as
a
freshman
of
whom
a
large
proportion
were
enough
in
fact
to
give
the
tone
to
the
college
which
was
decidedly
fast
fewer
and
fewer
of
the
ambrose
men
appeared
in
the
or
among
the
prize
men
they
no
longer
led
the
debates
in
the
union
the
boat
lost
place
after
place
on
the
river
the
eleven
got
beaten
in
all
the
matches
but
now
a
reaction
had
begun
the
fellows
recently
elected
were
men
of
great
attainments
chosen
as
the
most
likely
persons
to
restore
as
tutors
the
golden
days
of
the
college
our
hero
on
leaving
school
had
bound
himself
solemnly
to
write
all
his
doings
to
the
friend
he
had
left
behind
him
and
extracts
from
his
first
letter
from
college
will
give
a
better
idea
of
the
place
than
any
account
by
a
third
party
well
first
and
foremost
it
an
awfully
idle
place
at
any
rate
for
us
freshmen
fancy
now
i
am
in
twelve
lectures
a
week
of
an
hour
each
there
a
treat
two
hours
a
day
and
no
extra
work
at
all
of
course
i
never
look
at
a
lecture
before
i
go
in
i
know
it
all
nearly
by
heart
and
for
the
present
the
light
work
suits
me
for
there
plenty
to
see
in
this
place
we
keep
very
gentlemanly
hours
chapel
every
morning
at
eight
and
evening
at
seven
you
must
attend
once
a
day
and
twice
on
sundays
and
be
in
gates
at
twelve
and
you
ought
to
dine
in
hall
perhaps
four
days
a
week
all
the
rest
of
your
time
you
do
just
what
you
like
with
my
rooms
are
right
up
in
the
roof
with
a
commanding
view
of
tiles
and
pleasant
enough
separated
from
all
mankind
by
a
great
outer
door
eighteen
by
twelve
bedroom
twelve
by
eight
and
a
little
cupboard
for
the
scout
ah
geordie
the
scout
is
an
institution
fancy
me
waited
on
and
valeted
by
a
stout
party
in
black
of
quiet
gentlemanly
planners
he
takes
the
deepest
interest
in
my
possessions
and
proceedings
and
is
evidently
used
to
good
society
to
judge
by
the
amount
of
crockery
and
glass
wines
liquors
and
grocery
which
he
thinks
indispensable
for
my
due
establishment
he
waits
on
me
in
hall
where
we
go
in
full
fig
of
cap
and
gown
at
five
and
get
very
good
dinners
and
cheap
enough
but
after
all
the
river
is
the
feature
of
oxford
to
my
mind
i
expect
i
shall
take
to
boating
furiously
i
have
been
down
the
river
three
or
four
times
already
with
some
other
freshmen
and
it
is
glorious
exercise
that
i
can
see
though
we
bungle
and
cut
crabs
desperately
at
present
within
a
day
or
two
of
the
penning
of
this
epistle
tom
realised
one
of
the
objects
of
his
young
oxford
ambition
and
succeeded
in
embarking
in
a
skiff
by
himself
he
had
been
such
a
proficient
in
all
the
rugby
games
that
he
started
off
in
the
full
confidence
that
if
he
could
only
have
a
turn
or
two
alone
he
should
satisfy
not
only
himself
but
everybody
else
that
he
was
a
oar
but
the
truth
soon
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
pulling
especially
sculling
does
not
like
reading
and
writing
come
by
nature
however
he
addressed
himself
manfully
to
his
task
savage
indeed
but
resolved
to
get
down
to
sandford
and
back
before
or
perish
in
the
attempt
fortunately
the
prudent
boatman
had
embarked
our
hero
in
one
of
the
safest
of
the
tubs
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
down
kennington
reach
slowly
indeed
and
with
much
labour
that
he
heard
energetic
shouts
behind
him
the
next
minute
the
bows
of
his
boat
whirled
round
the
old
tub
grounded
and
then
turning
over
shot
him
out
on
to
the
planking
of
the
steep
descent
into
the
small
lasher
the
rush
of
water
was
too
strong
for
him
and
rolling
him
over
plunged
him
into
the
pool
below
after
the
first
moment
of
astonishment
and
fright
tom
left
himself
to
the
stream
holding
his
breath
hard
and
paddling
gently
with
his
hands
soon
came
to
the
surface
and
was
about
to
strike
out
for
the
shore
when
he
caught
sight
of
a
skiff
coming
stern
foremost
down
the
descent
after
him
down
she
came
as
straight
as
an
arrow
into
the
tumult
below
the
sculler
sitting
upright
and
holding
his
skulls
steadily
in
the
water
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
be
going
under
but
righted
herself
and
glided
swiftly
into
the
still
water
while
the
sculler
glanced
round
till
he
caught
sight
of
our
hero
head
oh
there
you
are
he
said
looking
much
relieved
swim
ashore
look
after
your
boat
so
tom
swam
ashore
and
stood
there
dripping
and
watching
the
other
righting
his
tub
and
collecting
the
sculls
and
floating
here
and
there
in
the
pool
tom
had
time
to
look
him
well
over
and
was
well
satisfied
with
the
inspection
there
was
that
in
his
face
that
hit
tom
fancy
and
made
him
anxious
to
know
him
better
there
were
probably
not
three
men
in
the
university
who
would
have
dared
to
shoot
the
lasher
in
the
state
it
was
then
it
was
settled
at
tom
earnest
request
that
he
should
pull
the
sound
skiff
up
his
old
tub
was
leaking
considerably
while
his
companion
sat
in
the
stern
and
coached
him
tom
poured
out
his
thanks
for
his
new
tutor
instructions
which
were
given
so
judiciously
that
he
was
conscious
of
improving
at
every
stroke
he
disappeared
however
while
tom
was
wrangling
with
the
manager
as
to
the
amount
of
damage
done
to
the
tub
and
when
tom
to
his
joy
saw
him
come
into
hall
to
dinner
he
took
no
notice
of
tom
looks
of
recognition
he
learned
from
his
neighbour
that
his
name
was
hardy
that
he
was
one
of
the
servitors
a
clever
fellow
but
a
very
queer
one
tom
resolved
to
waylay
him
as
soon
as
hall
was
over
but
hardy
avoided
him
summer
jervis
the
captain
of
the
ambrose
boat
club
miller
the
cox
and
smith
commonly
known
as
diogenes
smith
from
a
habit
he
had
of
using
his
as
an
armchair
were
determined
to
make
a
success
of
the
boat
and
tom
had
the
good
fortune
to
get
a
place
in
the
college
eight
an
achievement
which
is
always
a
feather
in
the
cap
of
a
freshman
when
the
summer
term
came
miller
at
once
took
the
crew
in
hand
then
came
the
first
night
of
the
races
and
at
three
tom
was
restless
and
distracted
knowing
that
two
hours
and
a
half
had
got
to
pass
before
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
boats
however
at
last
the
time
slipped
away
and
the
captain
and
miller
mustered
their
crew
at
the
college
gates
and
walked
off
to
the
river
half
the
undergraduates
of
oxford
streamed
along
with
them
no
time
was
lost
on
arrival
at
the
barge
in
the
and
in
two
minutes
the
ambrose
eight
were
all
standing
in
flannel
trousers
silk
jerseys
and
jackets
at
the
then
the
boat
swung
steadily
down
past
the
mouth
of
the
cherwell
and
through
the
gut
to
the
hark
the
first
gun
all
the
boats
have
turned
crowds
of
men
on
the
bank
are
agitated
with
the
coming
excitement
jervis
quiet
and
full
of
confidence
looks
round
from
his
seat
he
is
stroking
takes
a
sliced
lemon
from
his
pocket
puts
a
small
piece
into
his
mouth
and
passes
it
on
jackets
off
says
miller
and
the
jackets
are
thrown
on
shore
and
gathered
up
by
the
boatman
eight
seconds
more
only
miller
calls
out
look
out
for
the
flash
remember
all
eyes
in
the
boat
there
it
comes
at
last
the
flash
of
the
starting
gun
the
boat
breaks
away
with
a
bound
and
a
dash
the
oars
flash
in
the
water
and
the
boat
leaps
forward
for
the
first
ten
strokes
tom
was
in
too
great
fear
of
making
a
mistake
to
feel
or
hear
or
see
but
as
the
crew
settled
down
into
the
long
sweep
consciousness
returned
and
amid
all
the
babel
of
voices
on
the
bank
he
could
hear
hardy
yelling
steady
well
pulled
steady
and
now
the
ambrose
boat
is
well
away
from
the
boat
behind
and
as
it
nears
the
gut
it
is
plainly
gaining
on
exeter
the
boat
in
front
you
gaining
miller
mutters
and
the
captain
responds
with
a
wink
shouts
come
from
the
bank
now
st
ambrose
now
exeter
in
another
moment
both
boats
are
in
the
gut
and
miller
motionless
as
a
statue
till
now
calls
out
give
it
her
boys
six
strokes
and
we
are
into
them
old
jervis
lashes
his
oar
through
the
water
the
boat
answers
to
the
spurt
and
tom
feels
a
little
shock
and
hears
a
grating
sound
as
miller
shouts
unship
oars
bow
and
three
the
nose
of
the
ambrose
boat
glides
quietly
up
the
side
of
the
exeter
the
first
bump
has
been
made
two
more
bumps
were
made
on
the
next
two
nights
and
bets
were
laid
freely
that
ambrose
would
bump
oriel
and
become
head
of
the
river
but
the
oriel
crew
were
mostly
old
oars
seasoned
in
many
a
race
and
one
or
two
in
the
ambrose
boat
were
getting
stale
something
had
to
be
done
and
when
drysdale
a
resenting
miller
strictures
on
his
performance
at
no
declined
to
row
any
more
tom
suggested
that
hardy
would
row
if
he
were
asked
hardy
shy
and
proud
because
of
his
poverty
was
little
known
in
ambrose
but
a
fast
friendship
had
grown
up
between
him
and
tom
brown
and
he
was
glad
enough
to
come
into
the
boat
at
the
captain
request
the
change
in
the
boat
made
all
the
difference
hardy
was
out
sculling
every
day
on
the
river
and
was
consequently
in
good
training
he
was
besides
a
man
of
long
muscular
arms
it
was
a
great
race
inch
by
inch
ambrose
gained
on
oriel
creeping
up
slowly
but
surely
but
the
bump
was
not
made
till
both
boats
were
close
on
the
so
near
a
shave
was
it
as
for
the
scene
on
the
bank
it
was
a
of
delirious
joy
ambrose
was
head
of
the
river
a
there
was
a
certain
inn
called
the
choughs
where
the
ambrose
men
were
in
the
habit
of
calling
for
ale
on
their
way
back
from
the
river
and
it
had
become
the
correct
thing
for
ambrosians
to
make
much
of
miss
patty
the
landlady
niece
considering
the
circumstances
it
was
a
wonder
patty
was
not
more
spoilt
than
was
the
case
as
it
was
hardy
had
to
admit
that
the
girl
held
her
own
well
without
doing
or
saying
anything
unbecoming
a
modest
woman
but
he
was
convinced
that
tom
was
in
her
toils
and
after
pondering
what
he
ought
to
do
decided
to
speak
plainly
tom
had
gone
into
hardy
rooms
according
to
his
custom
after
hall
and
hardy
at
once
opened
fire
concerning
the
choughs
brown
you
no
right
to
go
to
that
place
he
said
abruptly
why
said
tom
you
know
why
said
hardy
why
am
i
not
to
go
to
the
choughs
because
there
happens
to
be
a
pretty
barmaid
there
all
our
crew
go
and
twenty
other
men
besides
yes
but
do
any
of
them
go
in
the
sort
of
way
you
do
does
she
look
at
any
one
of
them
as
she
does
at
you
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
about
it
said
tom
how
should
i
know
that
not
fair
or
true
or
like
you
brown
said
hardy
you
do
know
that
that
girl
does
care
a
straw
for
the
other
men
who
go
there
you
do
know
that
she
is
beginning
to
care
for
you
i
taken
it
on
myself
to
speak
to
you
about
this
and
i
should
be
your
friend
if
i
shirked
it
you
sha
go
on
with
this
folly
this
sin
for
want
of
warning
so
it
seems
said
tom
doggedly
now
i
think
i
had
warning
enough
suppose
we
drop
the
subject
not
yet
said
hardy
firmly
there
are
only
two
endings
to
this
sort
of
business
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
a
right
and
a
wrong
one
eh
and
because
i
your
friend
you
assume
that
my
end
will
be
the
wrong
one
i
say
the
end
be
the
wrong
one
here
there
no
right
end
think
of
your
family
you
dare
not
tell
me
that
you
will
marry
her
i
not
tell
you
said
tom
starting
up
i
dare
tell
any
man
anything
i
please
i
say
again
went
on
hardy
you
not
say
you
mean
to
marry
her
you
do
mean
it
and
as
you
do
to
kiss
her
in
the
passage
as
you
did
tonight
so
you
were
sneaking
behind
to
watch
me
burst
out
tom
hardy
only
answered
calmly
and
slowly
i
will
not
take
these
words
from
any
man
you
had
better
leave
my
rooms
the
next
minute
tom
was
in
the
passage
the
next
striding
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
inner
quadrangle
in
the
peace
of
the
pale
moonlight
the
following
day
and
for
many
days
neither
hardy
nor
tom
spoke
to
one
another
both
were
wretched
and
both
feared
lest
others
should
notice
the
quarrel
tom
went
more
and
more
to
the
choughs
and
patty
noticed
a
change
in
the
youth
a
change
that
and
her
then
for
the
next
few
days
tom
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
downwards
he
left
off
pulling
on
the
river
shunned
his
old
friends
and
lived
with
a
set
of
men
who
were
ready
enough
to
let
him
share
all
their
brutal
orgies
drysdale
with
whom
tom
had
been
on
good
terms
noted
the
difference
and
advised
him
to
cut
the
choughs
business
you
not
the
sort
of
a
fellow
to
go
in
for
this
kind
of
thing
he
said
i
be
hanged
if
it
wo
kill
you
or
make
a
devil
of
you
before
long
make
up
your
mind
to
cut
the
whole
concern
old
fellow
i
awfully
wretched
drysdale
was
all
tom
could
say
all
the
same
tom
could
not
follow
drysdale
advice
at
once
and
break
off
his
visits
to
the
choughs
altogether
the
real
crisis
was
over
he
had
managed
to
pass
through
the
eye
of
the
storm
and
was
drifting
into
the
skirts
of
it
conscious
of
an
escape
from
utter
shipwreck
his
visits
to
the
choughs
became
shorter
he
never
stayed
behind
now
after
the
other
men
and
avoided
interviews
with
patty
alone
as
diligently
as
he
had
sought
them
before
patty
unable
to
account
for
this
fresh
change
of
manner
was
piqued
and
ready
to
revenge
herself
in
a
hundred
little
ways
if
she
had
been
really
in
love
with
him
it
would
have
been
a
different
matter
but
she
was
not
in
the
last
six
weeks
she
certainly
had
often
had
visions
of
the
pleasures
of
being
a
lady
and
keeping
servants
but
her
liking
was
not
more
than
skin
deep
of
late
indeed
she
had
been
much
more
frightened
than
attracted
by
the
conduct
of
her
admirer
and
really
felt
it
a
relief
notwithstanding
her
pique
when
he
retired
into
a
less
demonstrative
state
before
the
end
of
that
summer
term
tom
had
it
made
up
with
hardy
and
it
was
hardy
who
at
tom
request
called
in
at
the
choughs
just
to
see
how
things
were
going
on
tom
saw
at
a
glance
that
something
had
happened
when
hardy
appeared
again
what
is
it
she
is
not
ill
he
said
quickly
no
quite
well
her
aunt
says
you
did
see
her
then
no
the
fact
is
she
has
gone
home
the
master
the
years
speed
by
bringing
their
changes
to
ambrose
hardy
is
a
fellow
and
tutor
of
the
college
in
tom
second
year
and
drysdale
has
been
requested
to
remove
his
name
from
the
books
tom
is
all
for
politics
now
and
the
theories
he
propounds
in
the
union
gain
him
the
name
of
chartist
brown
in
his
third
year
hardy
often
brought
him
down
from
high
talk
of
universal
democracy
and
the
good
cause
by
insisting
on
making
the
younger
man
explain
what
he
really
meant
and
though
tom
suffered
under
this
severe
treatment
in
the
end
he
generally
came
round
to
acknowledge
the
reasonableness
of
hardy
methods
of
argument
it
was
a
trying
year
to
tom
this
third
and
last
year
full
of
large
dreams
and
small
performances
of
hopes
and
struggles
ending
in
failure
and
disappointment
the
common
pursuits
of
the
place
had
lost
their
freshness
and
with
it
much
of
their
charm
he
was
beginning
to
feel
himself
in
a
cage
and
to
beat
against
the
bars
of
it
squire
brown
was
passing
through
oxford
and
paid
his
son
a
visit
in
the
last
term
tom
gave
a
small
which
went
off
admirably
and
the
squire
enlarged
upon
the
great
improvement
in
young
men
and
habits
of
the
university
especially
in
the
matter
of
drinking
tom
had
only
opened
three
bottles
of
port
in
his
time
the
men
would
have
drunk
certainly
not
less
than
a
bottle
a
man
but
as
the
squire
walked
back
to
his
hotel
he
was
deeply
moved
at
the
radical
views
his
son
now
held
he
could
not
understand
these
new
notions
of
young
men
and
thought
them
mischievous
and
bad
at
the
same
time
he
was
too
fair
a
man
to
try
to
dragoon
his
son
out
of
anything
which
he
really
believed
the
fact
had
begun
to
dawn
on
the
squire
that
the
world
had
changed
a
good
deal
since
his
time
while
tom
on
his
part
valued
his
father
confidence
and
love
above
his
own
opinions
by
degrees
the
honest
beliefs
of
father
and
son
no
longer
looked
monstrous
to
one
another
and
the
views
of
each
of
them
were
modified
one
more
look
must
be
taken
at
the
old
college
our
hero
is
up
in
the
summer
term
keeping
his
three
weeks
residence
the
necessary
preliminary
to
an
degree
we
find
him
sitting
in
hardy
rooms
tea
is
over
scouts
out
of
college
candles
lighted
and
silence
reigning
except
when
distant
sounds
of
mirth
come
from
some
undergraduates
rooms
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
quad
why
ca
you
give
a
fellow
his
degree
quietly
says
tom
without
making
him
come
and
kick
his
heels
here
for
three
weeks
you
ungrateful
dog
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
enjoyed
coming
back
and
sitting
in
dignity
in
the
bachelors
seats
in
chapel
and
at
the
bachelors
table
in
hall
and
thinking
how
much
wiser
you
are
than
the
undergraduates
besides
your
old
friends
want
to
see
you
and
you
ought
to
want
to
see
them
well
i
very
glad
to
see
you
again
old
fellow
but
who
else
is
there
i
care
to
see
my
old
friends
are
gone
and
the
youngsters
look
on
me
as
a
sort
of
don
and
i
do
appreciate
the
dignity
you
have
never
broken
with
the
place
and
then
you
always
did
your
duty
and
have
done
the
college
credit
you
ca
enter
into
the
feelings
of
a
fellow
who
wasted
three
parts
of
his
time
here
come
come
tom
you
might
have
read
more
certainly
and
taken
a
higher
degree
but
after
all
i
believe
your
melancholy
comes
from
your
not
being
asked
to
pull
in
the
boat
perhaps
it
does
do
you
call
it
degrading
to
be
pulling
in
the
torpid
in
one
old
age
mortified
vanity
it
a
capital
boat
i
wonder
how
we
should
have
liked
to
have
been
turned
out
for
some
bachelor
just
because
he
had
pulled
a
good
oar
in
his
day
not
at
all
i
do
blame
the
youngsters
by
the
way
they
an
uncommonly
nice
set
much
better
behaved
in
every
way
than
we
were
why
the
college
is
a
different
place
altogether
and
as
you
are
the
only
new
tutor
it
must
have
been
your
doing
now
i
want
to
know
your
secret
i
no
secret
except
taking
a
real
interest
in
all
that
the
men
do
and
living
with
them
as
much
as
i
can
you
may
guess
it
is
much
of
a
trial
to
me
to
steer
the
boat
down
or
run
on
the
bank
and
coach
the
crew
and
now
the
president
of
ambrose
himself
comes
out
to
see
the
boat
but
i
do
mean
to
stop
up
more
than
another
year
now
at
the
outside
i
have
been
tutor
nearly
three
years
and
that
about
long
enough
the
talk
went
on
until
the
clock
struck
twelve
hallo
said
tom
time
for
me
to
knock
out

victor

from
boyhood
and
after
minor

et
poésies
hugo
early
became
the
protagonist
of
the
romantic
movement
in
french
literature
in

active
part
in
politics
with
the
result
that
from
to
he
lived
in
exile
first
in
jersey
and
then
in
guernsey
les
misérables
is
not
only
the
greatest
of
all
victor
hugo
productions
but
is
in
many
respects
the
greatest
work
of
fiction
ever
conceived
an
enormous
range
of
matter
is
pressed
into
its
pages
by
turn
historical
philosophical
lyrical
humanitarian
but
running
through
all
the
change
of
scene
is
the
tragedy
and
comedy
of
life
at
its
darkest
and
its
brightest
and
of
human
passions
at
their
worst
and
at
their
best
it
is
more
than
a
novel
it
is
a
magnificent
plea
for
the
outcasts
of
society
for
those
who
are
crushed
by
the
mighty
edifice
of
social
order
yet
throughout
it
all
there
is
the
insistent
note
of
the
final
triumph
of
goodness
in
the
heart
of
man
the
story
appeared
in
when
hugo
was
sixty
years
old
and
was
written
during
his
exile
in
guernsey

was
translated
before
publication
into

jean
valjean
early
in
october
at
the
close
of
the
afternoon
a
man
came
into
the
little
town
of
d
he
was
on
foot
and
the
few
people
about
looked
at
him
suspiciously
the
traveller
was
of
wretched
appearance
though
stout
and
robust
and
in
the
full
vigour
of
life
he
was
evidently
a
stranger
and
tired
dusty
and
wearied
with
a
long
tramp
but
neither
of
the
two
inns
in
the
town
would
give
him
food
or
shelter
though
he
offered
good
money
for
payment
he
was
an
that
was
enough
to
exclude
him
in
despair
he
went
to
the
prison
and
asked
humbly
for
a
lodging
but
the
jailer
told
him
that
was
impossible
unless
he
got
arrested
first
it
was
a
cold
night
and
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
alps
it
seemed
there
was
no
refuge
open
to
him
then
as
he
sat
down
on
a
stone
bench
in
the
marketplace
and
tried
to
sleep
a
lady
coming
out
of
the
cathedral
noticed
him
and
learning
his
homeless
state
bade
him
knock
at
the
bishop
house
for
the
good
bishop
charity
and
compassion
were
known
in
all
the
neighbourhood
at
the
man
knock
the
bishop
who
lived
alone
with
his
sister
madame
magloire
and
an
old
housekeeper
said
come
in
and
the
entered
he
told
them
at
once
that
his
name
was
jean
valjean
that
he
was
a
who
had
spent
nineteen
years
at
the
hulks
and
that
he
had
been
walking
for
four
days
since
his
release
it
is
the
same
wherever
i
go
the
man
went
on
they
all
say
to
me
off
i
am
very
tired
and
hungry
will
you
let
me
stay
here
i
will
pay
madame
magloire
said
the
bishop
please
lay
another
knife
and
fork
sit
down
monsieur
and
warm
yourself
we
shall
have
supper
directly
and
your
bed
will
be
got
ready
while
we
are
supping
joy
and
amazement
were
on
the
man
face
he
stammered
his
thanks
as
though
beside
himself
the
bishop
in
honour
of
his
guest
had
silver
forks
and
spoons
placed
on
the
table
the
man
took
his
food
with
frightful
voracity
and
paid
no
attention
to
anyone
till
the
meal
was
over
then
the
bishop
showed
him
his
bed
in
an
alcove
and
an
hour
later
the
whole
household
was
asleep
jean
valjean
soon
woke
up
again
for
nineteen
years
he
had
been
at
the
galleys
originally
a
pruner
of
trees
he
had
broken
a
baker
window
and
stolen
a
loaf
one
hard
winter
when
there
was
no
work
to
be
had
and
for
this
the
sentence
was
five
years
time
after
time
he
had
tried
to
escape
and
had
always
been
recaptured
and
for
each
offence
a
fresh
sentence
was
imposed
nineteen
years
for
breaking
a
window
and
stealing
a
loaf
he
had
gone
into
prison
sobbing
and
shuddering
he
came
out
full
of
hatred
and
bitterness
that
night
at
the
bishop
house
for
the
first
time
in
nineteen
years
jean
valjean
had
received
kindness
he
was
moved
and
shaken
it
seemed
inexplicable
he
got
up
from
his
bed
everyone
was
asleep
the
house
was
perfectly
still
jean
valjean
seized
the
silver
which
stood
in
the
room
put
the
silver
into
his
knapsack
and
fled
out
of
the
house
in
the
morning
while
the
bishop
was
breakfasting
the
gendarmes
brought
in
jean
valjean
the
sergeant
explained
that
they
had
met
him
running
away
and
had
arrested
him
because
of
the
silver
they
found
on
him
i
gave
you
the
candlesticks
too
said
the
bishop
they
are
silver
why
did
not
you
take
them
with
the
rest
of
the
plate
then
turning
to
the
gendarmes
it
is
a
mistake
we
are
to
let
him
go
said
the
sergeant
certainly
said
the
bishop
the
gendarmes
retired
my
friend
said
the
bishop
to
jean
valjean
here
are
your
candlesticks
take
them
with
you
he
added
in
a
low
voice
never
forget
that
you
have
promised
me
to
use
this
silver
to
become
an
honest
man
my
brother
you
belong
no
longer
to
evil
but
to
good
jean
valjean
never
remembered
having
promised
anything
he
left
the
bishop
house
and
the
town
dazed
and
stupefied
it
was
a
new
world
he
had
come
into
he
walked
on
for
miles
and
then
sat
down
by
the
roadside
to
think
presently
a
small
savoyard
boy
passed
him
and
as
he
passed
dropped
a
piece
on
the
ground
jean
valjean
placed
his
foot
upon
it
in
vain
the
boy
prayed
him
for
the
coin
jean
valjean
sat
motionless
deep
in
thought
only
when
the
boy
had
gone
on
in
despair
did
jean
valjean
wake
from
his
reverie
he
shouted
out
little
gervais
little
gervais
for
the
boy
had
told
him
his
name
the
lad
was
out
of
sight
and
hearing
and
no
answer
came
the
enormity
of
his
crime
came
home
to
him
and
jean
valjean
fell
on
the
ground
and
for
the
first
time
in
nineteen
years
he
wept
father
on
a
certain
december
night
in
a
stranger
entered
the
town
of
m
at
the
very
time
when
a
great
fire
had
just
broken
out
in
the
town
hall
this
man
at
once
rushed
into
the
flames
and
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
saved
the
two
children
of
the
captain
of
gendarmes
in
consequence
of
this
act
no
one
thought
of
asking
for
his
passport
the
stranger
settled
in
the
town
by
a
happy
invention
he
improved
the
manufacture
of
the
black
beads
the
chief
industry
of
m
and
in
three
years
from
a
very
small
capital
he
became
a
rich
man
and
brought
prosperity
to
the
place
in
father
madeleine
for
so
the
stranger
was
called
was
made
mayor
of
m
by
unanimous
request
an
honour
he
had
declined
the
previous
year
before
he
came
everything
was
languishing
in
the
town
and
now
a
few
years
later
there
was
healthy
life
for
all
father
madeleine
employed
everybody
who
came
to
him
the
only
condition
he
made
was
honesty
from
the
men
he
expected
from
the
women
purity
prosperity
did
not
make
father
madeleine
change
his
habits
he
performed
his
duties
as
mayor
but
lived
a
solitary
and
simple
life
avoiding
society
his
strength
although
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
was
enormous
it
was
noticed
that
he
read
more
as
his
leisure
increased
and
that
as
the
years
went
by
his
speech
became
gentler
and
more
polite
one
person
only
in
all
the
district
looked
doubtfully
at
the
mayor
and
that
was
javert
inspector
of
police
javert
born
in
prison
was
the
incarnation
of
police
duty
implacable
resolute
fanatical
he
arrived
in
m
when
father
madeleine
was
already
a
rich
man
and
he
felt
sure
he
had
seen
him
before
one
day
in
the
mayor
interfered
to
prevent
javert
sending
a
poor
woman
named
fantine
to
prison
fantine
had
been
dismissed
from
the
factory
without
the
knowledge
of
madeleine
and
her
one
hope
in
life
was
in
her
little
girl
whom
she
called
cosette
now
cosette
was
boarded
out
at
the
village
of
montfermeil
some
leagues
distance
from
m
with
a
family
grasping
and
dishonest
and
to
raise
money
for
cosette
keep
had
brought
fantine
to
misery
and
sickness
the
mayor
could
save
fantine
from
prison
he
could
not
save
her
life
but
before
the
unhappy
woman
died
she
had
delivered
a
paper
to
madeleine
authorising
him
to
take
her
child
and
madeleine
had
accepted
the
trust
it
was
when
fantine
lay
dying
in
the
hospital
that
javert
who
had
quite
decided
in
his
own
mind
who
madeleine
was
came
to
the
mayor
and
asked
to
be
dismissed
from
the
service
i
have
denounced
you
le
maire
to
the
prefect
of
police
at
paris
as
jean
valjean
an
who
has
been
wanted
for
the
robbery
of
a
little
savoyard
more
than
five
years
ago
and
what
answer
did
you
receive
that
i
was
mad
for
the
real
jean
valjean
has
been
found
ah
javert
explained
that
an
old
man
had
been
arrested
for
breaking
into
an
orchard
that
on
being
taken
to
the
prison
he
had
been
recognised
by
several
people
as
jean
valjean
and
that
he
javert
himself
recognised
him
he
was
to
be
tried
at
arras
and
as
he
was
an
his
sentence
would
be
for
life
terrible
was
the
anguish
of
madeleine
that
night
he
had
done
all
that
man
could
do
to
obliterate
the
past
and
now
it
seemed
another
was
to
be
taken
in
his
place
the
torture
and
torment
ended
in
the
morning
madeleine
set
out
for
arras
madeleine
arrived
before
the
was
condemned
he
proved
to
the
court
astonishment
that
he
the
revered
and
philanthropic
mayor
of
m
was
jean
valjean
and
that
the
prisoner
had
merely
committed
a
trivial
theft
then
he
left
the
court
returned
to
m
removed
what
money
he
had
buried
it
and
arranged
his
affairs
a
few
days
later
jean
valjean
was
sent
back
to
the
galleys
at
toulon
and
with
his
removal
the
prosperity
of
m
speedily
collapsed
this
was
in
july
in
november
of
that
year
the
following
paragraph
appeared
in
the
toulon
paper
yesterday
a
convict
on
his
return
from
rescuing
a
sailor
fell
into
the
sea
and
was
drowned
his
body
has
not
been
found
his
name
was
registered
as
jean
valjean
a
hunted
at
christmas
in
the
year
an
old
man
came
to
the
village
of
montfermeil
called
at
the
inn
paid
money
to
the
rascally
innkeeper
thénardier
and
carried
off
little
cosette
to
paris
the
old
man
rented
a
large
garret
in
an
old
house
and
cosette
became
inexpressibly
happy
with
her
doll
and
with
the
good
man
who
loved
her
so
tenderly
till
then
jean
valjean
had
never
loved
anything
he
had
never
been
a
father
lover
husband
or
friend
when
he
saw
cosette
and
had
rescued
her
he
felt
his
heart
strangely
moved
all
the
affection
he
had
was
aroused
and
went
out
to
this
child
jean
valjean
was
and
cosette
eight
and
all
the
love
of
his
life
hitherto
untouched
melted
into
a
benevolent
devotion
cosette
too
changed
she
had
been
separated
from
her
mother
at
such
an
early
age
that
she
could
not
remember
her
and
the
thénardiers
had
treated
her
harshly
in
jean
valjean
she
found
a
father
just
as
he
found
a
daughter
in
cosette
weeks
passed
away
these
two
beings
led
a
wonderfully
happy
life
in
the
old
garret
cosette
would
chatter
laugh
and
sing
all
day
jean
valjean
was
careful
never
to
go
out
in
the
daytime
but
he
began
to
be
known
in
the
district
as
the
mendicant
who
gives
away
money
there
was
one
old
man
who
sat
by
some
church
steps
and
who
generally
seemed
to
be
praying
whom
jean
valjean
always
liked
to
relieve
one
night
when
jean
valjean
had
dropped
a
piece
of
money
into
his
hand
as
usual
the
beggar
suddenly
raised
his
eyes
stared
hard
at
him
and
then
quickly
dropped
his
head
jean
valjean
started
and
went
home
greatly
troubled
the
face
which
he
fancied
he
had
seen
was
that
of
javert
a
few
nights
later
jean
valjean
found
that
javert
had
taken
lodgings
in
the
same
house
where
he
and
cosette
lived
taking
the
child
by
the
hand
he
at
once
set
out
for
fresh
quarters
they
passed
through
silent
and
empty
streets
and
crossed
the
river
and
it
seemed
to
jean
valjean
that
no
one
was
in
pursuit
but
soon
he
noticed
four
men
plainly
shadowing
him
and
a
shudder
went
over
him
he
turned
from
street
to
street
trying
to
escape
from
the
city
and
at
last
found
himself
entrapped
in
a
what
was
to
be
done
there
was
no
time
to
turn
back
javert
had
undoubtedly
picketed
every
outlet
fortunately
for
jean
valjean
there
was
a
deep
shadow
in
the
street
so
that
his
own
movements
were
unseen
while
he
stood
hesitating
a
patrol
of
soldiers
entered
the
street
with
javert
at
their
head
they
frequently
halted
it
was
evident
that
they
were
exploring
every
hole
and
corner
and
one
might
judge
they
would
take
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
they
reached
the
spot
where
jean
valjean
was
it
was
a
frightful
moment
capture
meant
the
galleys
and
cosette
lost
for
ever
there
was
only
one
thing
possible
to
scale
the
wall
which
ran
along
a
wide
portion
of
the
street
but
the
difficulty
was
cosette
there
was
no
thought
of
abandoning
her
first
jean
valjean
procured
a
rope
from
the
lamppost
for
the
lamps
had
not
been
lit
that
night
owing
to
the
moonlight
this
he
fastened
round
the
child
taking
the
other
end
between
his
teeth
half
a
minute
later
he
was
on
his
knees
on
the
top
of
the
wall
cosette
watched
him
in
silence
all
at
once
she
heard
jean
valjean
saying
in
a
very
low
voice
lean
against
the
wall
do
speak
and
do
be
afraid
she
felt
herself
lifted
from
the
ground
and
before
she
had
time
to
think
where
she
was
she
found
herself
on
the
top
of
the
wall
jean
valjean
grasped
her
put
the
child
on
his
back
and
crawled
along
the
wall
till
he
came
to
a
sloping
roof
he
could
hear
the
thundering
voice
of
javert
giving
orders
to
the
patrol
to
search
the
to
the
end
jean
valjean
slipped
down
the
roof
still
carrying
cosette
and
leaped
on
the
ground
it
was
a
convent
garden
he
had
entered
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
the
clatter
of
muskets
and
the
imprecations
of
javert
resounded
from
the
convent
came
a
hymn
cosette
and
jean
valjean
fell
on
their
knees
presently
jean
valjean
discovered
that
the
gardener
was
an
old
man
whose
life
he
had
saved
at
m
and
who
in
his
gratitude
was
prepared
to
do
anything
for
madeleine
it
ended
in
cosette
entering
the
convent
school
as
a
pupil
and
jean
valjean
being
accepted
as
the
gardener
brother
the
good
nuns
never
left
the
precincts
of
their
convent
and
cared
nothing
for
the
world
beyond
their
gates
as
for
javert
he
had
delayed
attempting
an
arrest
even
when
his
suspicions
had
been
aroused
because
after
all
the
papers
said
the
convict
was
dead
but
once
convinced
he
hesitated
no
longer
his
disappointment
when
jean
valjean
escaped
him
was
midway
between
despair
and
fury
all
night
the
search
went
on
but
it
never
occurred
to
javert
that
a
steep
wall
of
fourteen
feet
could
be
climbed
by
an
old
man
with
a
child
several
years
passed
at
the
convent
jean
valjean
worked
daily
in
the
garden
and
shared
the
hut
and
the
name
of
the
old
gardener
fauchelevent
cosette
was
allowed
to
see
him
for
an
hour
every
day
the
peaceful
garden
the
fragrant
flowers
the
merry
cries
of
the
children
the
grave
and
simple
women
gradually
brought
happiness
to
jean
valjean
and
his
heart
melted
into
gratitude
for
the
security
he
had
found
something
higher
than
for
six
years
cosette
and
jean
valjean
stayed
at
the
convent
and
then
on
the
death
of
the
old
gardener
jean
valjean
now
bearing
the
name
of
fauchelevent
decided
that
as
cosette
was
not
going
to
be
a
nun
and
as
recognition
was
no
longer
to
be
feared
it
would
be
well
to
remove
into
the
city
so
a
house
was
taken
in
the
rue
plumet
and
here
with
a
faithful
servant
the
old
man
dwelt
with
his
adopted
child
but
jean
valjean
took
other
rooms
in
paris
in
case
of
accidents
cosette
was
growing
up
she
was
conscious
of
her
good
looks
and
she
was
in
love
with
a
youth
named
marius
the
son
of
baron
pontmercy
jean
valjean
learnt
of
this
secret
with
dismay
the
idea
of
parting
from
cosette
was
intolerable
to
him
then
in
june
came
desperate
street
fighting
in
paris
and
marius
was
in
command
of
one
of
the
revolutionary
barricades
at
this
barricade
javert
had
been
captured
as
a
spy
and
jean
valjean
who
was
known
to
the
revolutionaries
found
his
old
implacable
enemy
tied
to
a
post
waiting
to
be
shot
jean
valjean
requested
to
be
allowed
to
blow
out
javert
brains
himself
and
permission
was
given
holding
a
pistol
in
his
hand
jean
valjean
led
javert
who
was
still
bound
to
a
lane
out
of
sight
of
the
barricade
and
there
with
his
knife
cut
the
ropes
from
the
wrists
and
feet
of
his
prisoner
you
are
free
he
said
go
and
if
by
chance
i
leave
this
place
alive
i
am
to
be
found
under
the
name
of
fauchelevent
in
the
rue
de
no
javert
walked
a
few
steps
and
then
turned
back
and
cried
you
worry
me
i
would
rather
you
killed
me
go
was
the
only
answer
from
jean
valjean
javert
moved
slowly
away
and
when
he
had
disappeared
jean
valjean
discharged
his
pistol
in
the
air
soon
the
last
stand
of
the
insurgents
was
at
an
end
and
the
barricade
destroyed
jean
valjean
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
struggle
beyond
exposing
himself
to
the
bullets
of
the
soldiers
was
unhurt
but
marius
lay
wounded
and
insensible
in
his
arms
the
soldiers
were
shooting
down
all
who
tried
to
escape
the
situation
was
terrible
there
was
only
one
chance
for
life
underground
an
iron
grating
which
led
to
the
sewers
was
at
his
feet
jean
valjean
tore
it
open
and
disappeared
with
marius
on
his
shoulders
he
emerged
after
a
horrible
passage
through
a
grating
by
the
bank
of
the
river
only
to
find
there
the
implacable
javert
jean
valjean
was
quite
calm
inspector
javert
he
said
help
me
to
carry
this
man
home
then
do
with
me
what
you
please
a
cab
was
waiting
for
the
inspector
he
ordered
the
man
to
drive
to
the
address
jean
valjean
gave
him
marius
still
unconscious
was
taken
to
his
grandfather
house
inspector
javert
said
jean
valjean
grant
me
one
thing
more
let
me
go
home
for
a
minute
then
you
may
take
me
where
you
will
javert
told
the
driver
to
go
to
rue
de
no
when
they
reached
the
house
javert
said
go
up
i
will
wait
here
for
you
but
before
jean
valjean
reached
his
rooms
javert
had
gone
and
the
street
was
empty
javert
had
not
been
at
ease
since
his
life
had
been
spared
he
was
now
in
horrible
uncertainty
to
owe
his
life
to
an
to
accept
this
debt
and
then
to
repay
him
by
sending
him
back
to
the
galleys
was
impossible
to
let
a
malefactor
go
free
while
he
inspector
javert
took
his
pay
from
the
government
was
equally
impossible
it
seemed
there
was
something
higher
and
above
his
code
of
duty
something
he
had
not
come
into
collision
with
before
the
uncertainty
of
the
right
thing
to
be
done
destroyed
javert
to
whom
life
had
hitherto
been
perfectly
plain
he
could
not
live
recognising
jean
valjean
as
his
saviour
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
arrest
jean
valjean
inspector
javert
made
his
last
report
at
the
and
then
unable
to
face
the
new
conditions
of
life
walked
slowly
to
the
river
and
plunged
into
the
seine
where
the
water
rolls
round
and
round
in
an
endless
whirlpool
marius
recovered
and
married
cosette
and
jean
valjean
lived
alone
he
had
told
marius
who
he
was
jean
valjean
an
escaped
convict
and
marius
and
cosette
gradually
saw
less
and
less
of
the
old
man
but
before
jean
valjean
died
marius
learnt
the
whole
truth
of
the
heroic
life
of
the
old
man
who
had
rescued
him
from
the
lost
barricade
for
the
first
time
he
realised
that
jean
valjean
had
come
to
the
barricade
only
to
save
him
knowing
him
to
be
in
love
with
cosette
he
hastened
with
cosette
to
jean
valjean
room
but
the
old
man
last
hour
had
come
come
closer
come
closer
both
of
you
he
cried
i
love
you
so
much
it
is
good
to
die
like
this
you
love
me
too
my
cosette
i
know
always
had
a
fondness
for
the
poor
old
man
and
you
pontmercy
will
always
make
cosette
happy
there
were
several
things
i
wanted
to
say
but
they
do
matter
now
come
nearer
my
children
i
am
happy
in
dying
cosette
and
marius
fell
on
their
knees
and
covered
his
hands
with
kisses
jean
valjean
was
dead
notre
dame
de
paris
victor
hugo
was
already
eminent
as
one
of
the
greatest
dramatic
poets
of
his
day
before
he
gave
to
the
world
in
his
great
tragic
romance
notre
dame
de
paris
of
which
the
original
title
was
the
hunchback
of
notre
dame
hugo
has
said
that
the
story
was
suggested
to
him
by
the
greek
word
fate
which
one
day
he
discovered
carved
on
one
of
the
towers
of
the
famous
cathedral
these
greek
characters
he
says
black
with
age
and
cut
deep
into
the
stone
with
the
peculiarities
of
form
and
arrangement
common
to
the
gothic
caligraphy
that
marked
them
the
work
of
some
hand
in
the
middle
ages
and
above
all
the
sad
and
mournful
meaning
which
they
expressed
forcibly
impressed
me
in
notre
dame
there
is
all
the
tenderness
for
sorrow
and
sympathy
for
the
afflicted
which
found
even
fuller
and
deeper
expression
thirty
years
later
in
les
misérables
while
as
a
study
of
the
life
of
paris
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
the
great
church
after
which
the
romance
is
called
the
book
is
still
unrivalled
the
hunchback
of
notre
it
was
january
and
all
paris
was
keeping
the
double
festival
of
epiphany
and
the
feast
of
fools
the
lord
of
misrule
was
to
be
elected
and
all
who
were
competing
for
the
post
came
in
turn
and
made
a
grimace
at
a
broken
window
in
the
great
hall
of
the
palace
of
justice
the
ugliest
face
was
to
be
acclaimed
victor
by
the
populace
and
shouts
of
laughter
greeted
the
grotesque
appearances
the
vote
was
unanimous
in
favour
of
the
hunchback
of
notre
dame
he
had
but
stood
at
the
window
and
at
once
had
been
elected
the
square
nose
the
horseshoe
shaped
mouth
the
one
eye
overhung
by
a
bushy
red
eyebrow
the
forked
chin
and
the
strange
expression
of
amazement
malice
and
melancholy
who
had
seen
such
a
grimace
it
was
only
when
the
crowd
had
carried
away
the
lord
of
misrule
in
triumph
that
they
understood
that
the
grimace
was
the
natural
face
in
fact
the
entire
man
was
a
grimace
humpbacked
an
enormous
head
with
bristles
of
red
hair
broad
feet
huge
hands
crooked
legs
and
with
all
this
deformity
a
wonderful
vigour
agility
and
courage
such
was
the
newly
chosen
lord
of
misrule
a
giant
broken
to
pieces
and
badly
mended
he
was
recognised
by
the
crowd
in
the
streets
and
shouts
went
up
it
is
quasimodo
the
quasimodo
the
hunchback
of
notre
dame
a
pasteboard
tiara
and
imitation
robes
were
placed
on
him
and
quasimodo
submitted
with
a
sort
of
proud
docility
then
he
was
seated
upon
a
painted
barrow
and
twelve
men
raised
it
to
their
shoulders
and
the
procession
which
included
all
the
vagrants
and
rascals
of
paris
set
out
to
parade
the
city
there
was
a
certain
rapture
in
this
journey
for
quasimodo
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
a
thrill
of
vanity
hitherto
humiliation
and
contempt
had
been
his
portion
and
now
though
he
was
deaf
he
could
enjoy
the
plaudits
of
the
mob
mob
which
he
hated
because
he
felt
that
it
hated
him
suddenly
as
quasimodo
passed
triumphantly
along
the
streets
the
spectators
saw
a
man
dressed
like
a
priest
dart
out
and
snatch
away
the
gilded
crosier
from
the
mock
pope
a
cry
of
terror
rose
the
terrible
quasimodo
threw
himself
from
his
barrow
and
everyone
expected
to
see
him
tear
the
priest
limb
from
limb
instead
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
priest
and
submitted
to
have
his
tiara
torn
from
him
and
his
crosier
broken
the
fraternity
of
fools
determined
to
defend
their
pope
so
abruptly
dethroned
but
quasimodo
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
priest
put
his
fists
up
and
glared
at
his
assailants
so
that
the
crowd
melted
before
him
then
at
the
grave
beckoning
of
the
priest
quasimodo
followed
and
the
two
disappeared
down
a
narrow
side
street
the
one
human
being
whom
quasimodo
loved
was
this
priest
claude
frollo
archbishop
of
paris
and
this
was
quite
natural
for
it
was
claude
frollo
who
had
found
the
hunchback
a
deserted
forsaken
child
left
in
a
sack
at
the
entrance
to
notre
dame
and
in
spite
of
his
deformities
had
taken
him
fed
him
adopted
him
and
brought
him
up
claude
frollo
taught
him
to
speak
to
read
and
to
write
and
had
made
him
at
notre
dame
quasimodo
grew
up
in
notre
dame
cut
off
from
the
world
by
his
deformities
the
church
became
his
universe
and
his
gratitude
was
boundless
when
he
was
made
the
bells
had
made
him
deaf
but
he
could
understand
by
signs
claude
frollo
wishes
and
so
the
archdeacon
became
the
only
human
being
with
whom
quasimodo
could
hold
any
communication
notre
dame
and
claude
frollo
were
the
only
two
things
in
the
world
for
quasimodo
and
to
both
he
was
the
most
faithful
watchman
and
servant
in
the
year
quasimodo
was
about
twenty
and
claude
frollo
the
former
had
grown
up
the
latter
had
grown
old
on
that
same
january
a
young
girl
was
dancing
in
an
open
space
near
a
great
bonfire
in
paris
she
was
not
tall
but
seemed
to
be
so
erect
was
her
figure
she
danced
and
twirled
upon
an
old
piece
of
persian
carpet
and
every
eye
in
the
crowd
was
riveted
upon
her
in
her
grace
and
beauty
this
gypsy
girl
seemed
more
than
mortal
one
man
in
the
crowd
stood
more
absorbed
than
the
rest
in
watching
the
dancer
it
was
claude
frollo
the
archdeacon
and
though
his
hair
was
grey
and
scanty
in
his
eyes
the
fire
and
spirit
of
youth
still
sparkled
when
the
young
girl
stopped
at
last
breathless
the
people
applauded
eagerly
djali
said
the
gypsy
it
your
turn
now
and
a
pretty
little
white
goat
got
up
from
a
corner
of
the
carpet
djali
what
month
in
the
year
is
this
the
goat
raised
his
forefoot
and
struck
once
upon
the
tambourine
held
out
to
him
the
crowd
applauded
djali
what
day
of
the
month
is
it
the
goat
struck
the
tambourine
six
times
the
people
thought
it
was
wonderful
there
is
sorcery
in
this
said
a
forbidding
voice
in
the
crowd
it
was
the
voice
of
the
priest
claude
frolic
then
the
gypsy
began
to
take
up
a
collection
in
her
tambourine
and
presently
the
crowd
dispersed
later
in
the
day
when
darkness
had
fallen
as
the
gypsy
and
her
goat
were
proceeding
to
their
lodgings
quasimodo
seized
hold
of
the
girl
and
ran
off
with
her
murder
murder
shrieked
the
unfortunate
gypsy
halt
let
the
girl
go
you
ruffian
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
thunder
a
horseman
who
appeared
suddenly
from
a
cross
street
it
was
a
captain
of
the
king
archers
armed
from
head
to
foot
and
sword
in
hand
he
tore
the
gypsy
girl
from
the
arms
of
the
astonished
quasimodo
and
placed
her
across
his
saddle
before
the
hunchback
could
recover
from
his
surprise
a
squadron
of
royal
troops
going
on
duty
as
extra
watchmen
surrounded
him
and
he
was
seized
and
bound
the
gypsy
girl
sat
gracefully
upon
the
officer
saddle
placing
both
hands
upon
the
young
man
shoulders
and
gazing
at
him
fixedly
then
breaking
the
silence
she
said
tenderly
what
is
your
name
m
captain
phaebus
de
châteaupers
at
your
service
my
pretty
maid
said
the
officer
drawing
himself
up
thank
you
and
while
captain
phaebus
twirled
his
mustache
she
slipped
from
his
horse
and
vanished
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
bird
has
flown
but
the
bat
remains
captain
said
one
of
the
troopers
tightening
quasimodo
bonds
quasimodo
being
deaf
understood
nothing
of
the
proceedings
in
the
court
next
day
when
he
was
charged
with
creating
a
disturbance
and
of
rebellion
and
disloyalty
to
the
king
archers
the
chief
magistrate
also
being
deaf
and
at
the
same
time
anxious
to
conceal
his
infirmity
understood
nothing
that
quasimodo
said
the
hunchback
was
sentenced
to
be
taken
to
the
pillory
in
the
grève
to
be
beaten
and
to
be
kept
there
for
two
hours
quasimodo
remained
utterly
impassive
while
the
crowd
which
yesterday
had
hailed
him
as
lord
of
misrule
now
greeted
him
with
hooting
and
derision
the
pillory
was
a
simple
cube
of
masonry
some
ten
feet
high
and
hollow
within
a
horizontal
wheel
of
oak
was
at
the
top
and
to
this
the
victim
was
bound
in
a
kneeling
posture
a
very
steep
flight
of
stone
steps
led
to
the
wheel
all
the
people
laughed
merrily
when
quasimodo
was
seen
in
the
pillory
and
when
he
had
been
beaten
by
the
public
executioner
they
added
to
the
wretched
sufferer
misery
by
insults
and
occasionally
stones
there
was
hardly
a
spectator
in
the
crowd
that
had
not
some
grudge
real
or
imagined
against
the
hunchback
of
notre
dame
quasimodo
had
endured
the
torturer
whip
with
patience
but
he
rebelled
against
the
stones
and
struggled
in
his
fetters
till
the
old
wheel
creaked
on
its
timbers
then
as
he
could
accomplish
nothing
by
his
struggles
his
face
became
quiet
again
for
a
moment
the
cloud
was
lightened
when
the
poor
victim
saw
a
priest
seated
on
a
mule
approach
in
the
roadway
a
strange
smile
came
on
the
face
of
quasimodo
as
he
glanced
at
the
priest
yet
when
the
mule
was
near
enough
to
the
pillory
for
his
rider
to
recognise
the
prisoner
the
priest
cast
down
his
eyes
turned
back
hastily
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
avoid
humiliating
appeals
and
not
at
all
anxious
to
be
greeted
by
a
poor
wretch
in
the
pillory
the
priest
was
the
archdeacon
claude
frollo
the
smile
on
face
became
bitter
and
profoundly
sad
time
passed
he
had
been
there
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
wounded
incessantly
mocked
and
almost
stoned
to
death
suddenly
he
again
struggled
in
his
chains
with
renewed
despair
and
breaking
the
silence
which
he
had
kept
so
stubbornly
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
and
furious
voice
water
the
exclamation
of
distress
far
from
exciting
compassion
only
increased
the
amusement
of
the
paris
mob
not
a
voice
was
raised
except
to
mock
at
his
thirst
quasimodo
cast
a
despairing
look
upon
the
crowd
and
repeated
in
a
heartrending
voice
water
everyone
laughed
a
woman
aimed
a
stone
at
his
head
saying
that
will
teach
you
to
wake
us
at
night
with
your
cursed
chimes
here
a
cup
to
drink
out
of
said
a
man
throwing
a
broken
jug
at
his
breast
water
repeated
quasimodo
for
the
third
time
at
this
moment
he
saw
the
gypsy
girl
and
her
goat
come
through
the
crowd
his
eye
gleamed
he
did
not
doubt
that
she
too
came
to
be
avenged
and
to
take
her
turn
at
him
with
the
rest
he
watched
her
nimbly
climb
the
ladder
rage
and
spite
choked
him
he
longed
to
destroy
the
pillory
and
had
the
lightning
of
his
eye
had
power
to
blast
the
gypsy
girl
would
have
been
reduced
to
ashes
long
before
she
reached
the
platform
without
a
word
she
approached
the
sufferer
loosened
a
gourd
from
her
girdle
and
raised
it
gently
to
the
parched
lips
of
the
miserable
man
then
from
his
eye
a
great
tear
trickled
and
rolled
slowly
down
the
misshapen
face
so
long
convulsed
with
despair
the
gypsy
girl
smilingly
pressed
the
neck
of
the
gourd
to
jagged
mouth
he
drank
long
draughts
his
thirst
was
feverish
when
he
had
done
the
poor
wretch
put
out
his
black
lips
to
kiss
the
hand
which
had
helped
him
but
the
girl
remembering
the
violent
attempt
of
the
previous
night
and
not
quite
free
from
distrust
withdrew
her
hand
quickly
quasimodo
fixed
upon
her
a
look
of
reproach
and
unspeakable
sorrow
the
sight
of
this
beautiful
girl
succouring
a
man
in
the
pillory
so
deformed
and
wretched
seemed
sublime
and
the
people
were
immediately
affected
by
it
they
clapped
their
hands
and
shouted
noël
noël
esmeralda
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
gypsy
girl
came
down
from
the
pillory
and
a
mad
woman
called
out
come
down
come
down
you
will
go
up
again
presently
quasimodo
was
released
and
the
mob
thereupon
dispersed
the
archdeacon
in
spite
of
the
austerity
of
claude
frollo
life
pious
people
suspected
him
of
magic
his
silence
and
secretiveness
encouraged
this
feeling
he
was
known
to
be
at
work
in
the
long
hours
of
the
night
in
his
cell
in
notre
dame
and
he
wandered
about
the
streets
like
a
spectre
whenever
the
gypsy
girl
placed
her
carpet
within
sight
of
claude
frollo
cell
and
began
to
dance
the
priest
turned
from
his
books
and
resting
his
head
in
his
hands
gazed
at
her
then
he
would
go
down
into
the
public
thoroughfares
lured
on
by
some
burning
passion
within
quasimodo
too
would
desist
from
his
to
look
at
the
dancing
girl
the
hotter
the
fire
of
passion
burned
within
the
priest
the
farther
esmeralda
moved
from
him
he
discovered
that
she
was
in
love
with
captain
phoebus
her
rescuer
and
this
knowledge
added
fuel
to
the
flames
one
purpose
now
was
clear
to
him
he
would
give
up
all
for
the
dancing
girl
and
she
should
be
his
but
if
esmeralda
refused
to
come
to
him
then
the
archdeacon
resolved
that
she
should
die
before
she
married
anyone
else
at
any
time
he
could
have
her
arrested
on
the
charge
of
sorcery
and
the
goat
tricks
would
easily
procure
a
conviction
captain
phoebus
having
invited
esmeralda
to
meet
him
at
a
wineshop
the
priest
followed
the
couple
and
when
the
captain
to
whom
the
girl
was
the
merest
diversion
began
to
make
love
claude
frollo
unable
to
contain
himself
rushed
in
unobserved
and
stabbed
him
captain
phoebus
was
taken
up
for
dead
and
the
priest
vanished
as
silently
as
he
had
come
the
soldiers
of
the
watch
found
esmeralda
and
said
this
is
the
sorceress
who
has
stabbed
our
captain
so
esmeralda
was
brought
to
trial
on
the
charge
of
witchcraft
and
every
day
the
priest
from
notre
dame
came
into
court
it
was
a
tedious
process
for
not
only
was
the
girl
on
trial
but
the
goat
also
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
times
was
under
arrest
all
that
esmeralda
wanted
to
know
was
whether
phoebus
was
still
alive
and
she
was
told
by
the
judges
he
was
dying
the
indictment
against
her
was
that
with
her
accomplice
the
bewitched
goat
she
did
murder
and
stab
in
league
with
the
powers
of
darkness
by
the
aid
of
charms
and
spells
a
captain
of
the
king
troops
one
phoebus
de
châteaupers
and
it
was
vain
that
the
girl
denied
vehemently
her
guilt
how
do
you
explain
the
charge
brought
against
you
said
the
president
i
have
told
you
already
i
do
not
know
said
esmeralda
in
a
broken
voice
it
was
a
priest
a
priest
who
is
always
pursuing
me
that
it
said
the
president
it
is
a
goblin
monk
the
goat
having
performed
his
simple
tricks
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
esmeralda
still
refusing
to
admit
her
guilt
the
president
ordered
her
to
be
put
to
the
question
she
was
placed
on
the
rack
and
at
the
first
turn
of
the
screw
promised
to
confess
everything
then
the
lawyers
put
a
number
of
questions
to
her
and
esmeralda
answered
yes
in
every
case
it
was
plain
that
her
spirit
was
utterly
broken
then
the
court
having
read
the
confession
sentence
was
pronounced
she
was
to
be
taken
to
the
grève
where
the
pillory
stood
and
in
atonement
for
the
crimes
confessed
there
hanged
and
strangled
on
the
city
gibbet
and
likewise
this
your
goat
it
must
be
a
dream
the
girl
murmured
when
she
heard
the
sentence
but
if
esmeralda
had
yielded
at
the
first
turn
of
the
rack
nothing
would
make
her
yield
to
claude
frollo
when
he
came
to
see
her
in
prison
in
vain
he
promised
her
life
and
liberty
if
she
would
only
agree
to
love
him
in
vain
he
reproached
her
with
having
brought
disturbance
and
disquiet
into
his
soul
all
that
esmeralda
could
say
was
have
pity
on
me
have
pity
on
me
but
she
would
not
give
up
phoebus
and
when
the
priest
declared
phoebus
was
dead
she
turned
upon
him
and
called
him
monster
and
assassin
claude
frollo
unable
to
move
her
decided
to
let
her
die
and
the
day
of
execution
arrived
as
for
captain
phoebus
he
recovered
but
as
he
was
about
to
be
engaged
to
a
young
lady
of
wealth
he
thought
it
better
to
say
nothing
about
the
gypsy
girl
but
esmeralda
was
not
hanged
that
day
just
as
the
hangman
assistants
were
about
to
do
their
work
quasimodo
who
had
been
watching
everything
from
his
gallery
in
notre
dame
slid
down
by
a
rope
to
the
ground
rushed
at
the
two
executioners
flung
them
to
the
earth
with
his
huge
fists
seized
the
gypsy
girl
as
a
child
might
a
doll
and
with
one
bound
was
in
the
church
holding
her
above
his
head
and
shouting
in
a
tremendous
voice
sanctuary
sanctuary
sanctuary
the
mob
took
up
the
cry
and
ten
thousand
hands
clapped
approval
the
hangman
stood
stupefied
within
the
precincts
of
notre
dame
the
prisoner
was
secure
the
cathedral
was
a
sure
refuge
all
human
justice
ended
at
its
threshold
the
attack
on
notre
quasimodo
did
not
stop
running
and
shouting
sanctuary
till
he
reached
a
cell
built
over
the
aisles
in
notre
dame
here
he
deposited
esmeralda
carefully
untied
the
ropes
which
bruised
her
arms
and
spread
a
mattress
on
the
floor
then
he
left
her
and
returned
with
a
basket
of
provisions
the
girl
lifted
her
eyes
to
thank
him
but
could
not
utter
a
word
so
frightful
was
he
to
look
at
quasimodo
only
said
i
frighten
you
because
i
am
ugly
do
not
look
at
me
then
but
listen
all
day
you
must
stay
here
at
night
you
can
walk
anywhere
about
the
church
but
day
or
night
do
not
leave
the
church
or
you
will
be
lost
they
would
kill
you
and
i
should
die
then
he
vanished
but
when
she
awoke
next
morning
she
saw
him
at
the
window
of
her
cell
do
be
frightened
he
said
i
am
your
friend
i
only
came
to
see
if
you
were
asleep
i
am
deaf
you
did
not
know
that
i
never
realised
how
ugly
i
was
till
now
i
seem
to
you
like
some
awful
beast
eh
and
you
you
are
a
sunbeam
as
the
days
went
by
calm
returned
to
esmeralda
soul
and
with
calm
had
come
the
sense
of
security
and
with
security
hope
two
forces
were
now
at
work
to
remove
her
from
notre
dame
the
archdeacon
leaving
paris
to
avoid
her
execution
had
returned
to
learn
where
esmeralda
was
situated
from
his
cell
in
notre
dame
he
observed
her
movements
and
in
his
madness
jealous
of
service
to
her
resolved
to
have
her
removed
if
she
still
refused
him
he
would
give
her
up
to
justice
esmeralda
friends
all
the
gypsies
vagrants
cutthroats
and
of
paris
to
the
number
of
six
thousand
also
resolved
that
they
would
forcibly
rescue
her
from
notre
dame
lest
some
evil
should
overtake
her
paris
at
that
time
had
neither
police
nor
adequate
city
watchmen
at
midnight
the
monstrous
army
of
vagrants
set
out
and
it
was
not
until
they
were
outside
the
church
that
they
lit
their
torches
quasimodo
every
night
on
the
watch
at
once
supposed
that
the
invaders
had
some
foul
purpose
against
esmeralda
and
determined
to
defend
the
church
at
all
cost
the
battle
raged
furiously
at
the
great
west
doors
hammers
pincers
and
were
at
work
outside
quasimodo
retaliated
by
heaving
first
a
great
beam
of
wood
and
then
stones
and
other
missiles
on
the
besiegers
finally
when
they
had
reared
a
tall
ladder
to
the
first
gallery
and
had
crowded
it
with
men
quasimodo
by
sheer
force
pushed
the
ladder
away
and
it
tottered
and
fell
right
back
the
battle
only
ended
on
the
arrival
of
a
large
company
of
king
archers
when
the
vagrants
defeated
by
quasimodo
retired
fighting
while
the
battle
raged
claude
frollo
with
the
aid
of
a
disreputable
young
student
of
his
acquaintance
persuaded
esmeralda
to
leave
the
church
by
a
secret
door
at
the
back
and
to
escape
by
the
river
the
priest
was
so
hidden
in
his
cloak
that
the
girl
did
not
recognise
him
till
they
were
alone
in
the
city
in
the
grève
at
the
foot
of
the
public
scaffold
where
the
gallows
stood
claude
frollo
made
his
last
appeal
listen
he
said
i
have
saved
you
and
i
can
save
you
altogether
if
you
choose
choose
between
me
and
the
gibbet
there
was
silence
and
then
esmeralda
said
it
is
less
horrible
to
me
than
you
are
he
poured
out
his
soul
passionately
telling
her
that
his
life
was
nothing
without
her
love
but
the
girl
never
moved
it
was
daylight
now
for
the
last
time
will
you
be
mine
she
answered
emphatically
no
then
he
called
out
as
loud
as
he
could
and
presently
a
body
of
armed
men
appeared
soon
the
public
hangman
was
aroused
and
the
execution
which
had
been
interrupted
by
quasimodo
heroic
rescue
was
carried
out
meantime
what
of
quasimodo
he
had
rushed
to
her
cell
when
the
king
troops
having
beaten
off
the
vagrants
entered
the
church
and
it
was
empty
then
he
had
explored
every
nook
and
cranny
of
notre
dame
and
again
and
again
gone
the
round
of
the
church
for
an
hour
he
sat
in
despair
his
body
convulsed
by
sobs
suddenly
he
remembered
that
claude
frollo
had
a
secret
key
and
decided
that
the
priest
must
have
carried
her
off
at
that
very
moment
claude
returned
to
notre
dame
after
handing
over
esmeralda
to
the
hangman
quasimodo
watched
him
ascend
to
the
balustrade
at
the
top
of
the
tower
and
then
followed
him
the
priest
attention
was
too
absorbed
to
hear
the
hunchback
step
claude
rested
his
arms
on
the
balustrade
and
gazed
intently
at
the
gallows
in
the
grève
quasimodo
tried
to
make
out
what
it
was
the
priest
stared
at
and
then
he
recognised
esmeralda
in
the
hangman
arms
on
the
ladder
and
in
another
second
the
hangman
had
done
his
work
a
demoniac
laugh
broke
from
the
livid
lips
of
claude
frollo
quasimodo
could
not
hear
this
laughter
but
he
saw
it
he
rushed
furiously
upon
the
archdeacon
and
with
his
great
fists
he
hurled
claude
frollo
into
the
abyss
over
which
he
leaned
the
archdeacon
caught
at
a
gutter
and
hung
suspended
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
fell
more
than
two
hundred
feet
quasimodo
raised
his
eyes
to
the
gypsy
whose
body
still
swung
from
the
gibbet
and
then
lowered
them
to
the
shapeless
mass
on
the
pavement
beneath
and
these
were
all
i
have
ever
loved
he
said
sobbing
he
was
never
seen
again
in
notre
dame
some
two
years
later
when
there
were
certain
clearances
in
the
vault
where
the
body
of
esmeralda
had
been
deposited
the
skeleton
of
a
man
deformed
and
twisted
was
found
in
close
embrace
with
the
skeleton
of
a
woman
a
little
silk
bag
which
esmeralda
had
always
worn
was
around
the
neck
of
the
skeleton
of
the

published
in

written
during
his
exile
in
guernsey
of
all
hugo
romances
both
in
prose
and
in
verse
none
surpasses
this
for
sheer
splendour
of
imagination
and
diction
for
eloquence
and
sublimity
of
truth
it
is
in
short
an
idyll
of
passion
adventure
and
the
description
of
the
moods
and
mysteries
of
the
sea
is
incomparable
and
not
even
in
the
whole
of
hugo
works
can
there
be
found
anything
more
vivid
than
gilliatt

with
the
the
scene
of
the

and
the
book
itself
is
dedicated
to
the
isle
of
guernsey
severe
yet
gentle
my
present
asylum
my
probable
tomb
the
story
was
immensely
successful
on
its
appearance
and
was
at
once
translated
into
several
european
languages
a
lonely
a
guernseyman
named
gilliatt
who
was
avoided
by
his
neighbours
on
account
of
lonely
habits
and
a
certain
love
of
nature
which
the
suspicious
people
regarded
as
indicating
some
connection
with
the
devil
was
one
day
returning
on
a
rising
tide
from
his
fishing
when
he
fancied
he
saw
in
a
certain
projection
of
the
cliff
a
shadow
of
a
man
the
place
probably
attracted
gilliatt
gaze
because
it
was
a
favourite
sojourn
of
his
a
natural
seat
cut
in
the
great
cliffs
and
affording
a
magnificent
view
of
the
sea
it
was
a
place
to
which
some
uninitiated
traveller
would
climb
with
delight
from
the
shore
and
sit
entranced
by
the
scene
before
him
all
oblivious
of
the
rising
ocean
till
he
was
completely
cut
off
from
escape
no
shout
would
reach
the
ear
of
man
from
that
desolate
giant
chair
in
the
rock
gilliatt
steered
his
ship
nearer
to
the
cliff
and
saw
that
the
shadow
was
a
man
the
sea
was
already
high
the
rock
was
encircled
gilliatt
drew
nearer
the
man
was
asleep
he
was
attired
in
black
and
looked
like
a
priest
gilliatt
had
never
seen
him
before
the
fisherman
wore
off
skirted
the
rock
wall
and
approaching
so
close
to
the
dangerous
cliff
that
by
standing
on
the
gunwale
of
his
sloop
he
could
touch
the
foot
of
the
sleeper
succeeded
in
arousing
him
the
man
roused
and
muttered
i
was
looking
about
gilliatt
bade
him
jump
into
the
boat
when
he
had
landed
this
young
priest
who
had
a
somewhat
feminine
cast
of
features
a
clear
eye
and
a
grave
manner
gilliatt
perceived
that
he
was
holding
out
a
sovereign
in
a
very
white
hand
gilliatt
moved
the
hand
gently
away
there
was
a
pause
then
the
young
man
bowed
and
left
him
gilliatt
had
forgotten
all
about
this
stranger
when
a
voice
hailed
him
it
was
one
of
the
inhabitants
driving
by
quickly
there
is
news
gilliatt
at
the
bravées
what
is
it
i
am
too
hurried
to
tell
you
the
story
go
up
to
the
house
and
you
will
learn
the
bravées
was
the
residence
of
a
man
named
lethierry
he
had
raised
himself
to
a
position
of
wealth
by
starting
the
first
steamboat
between
guernsey
and
the
coast
of
normandy
he
called
this
vessel
la
durande
the
natives
who
prophesied
evil
of
such
a
frightful
invention
called
it
the
devil
boat
but
the
durande
went
to
and
fro
without
disaster
and
lethierry
gold
increased
there
was
nothing
in
all
the
universe
he
loved
so
much
as
this
marvellous
ship
worked
by
steam
next
to
the
durande
he
most
loved
his
pretty
niece
dérouchette
who
kept
house
for
him
one
day
as
gilliatt
was
walking
over
the
roads
dérouchette
who
was
ahead
of
him
had
stopped
for
a
moment
and
stooping
down
had
written
something
with
her
finger
in
the
snow
when
the
fisherman
reached
the
place
he
found
that
the
mischievous
little
creature
had
written
his
name
there
ever
since
that
hour
in
the
almost
unbroken
solitude
of
his
life
gilliatt
had
thought
about
dérouchette
now
that
he
heard
of
news
at
the
bravées
the
lonely
man
made
his
way
to
lethierry
house
which
was
the
nest
of
dérouchette
the
news
was
soon
told
the
durande
was
lost
presently
amid
the
details
of
the
story
the
durande
had
been
wrecked
in
a
fog
on
the
terrible
rocks
known
as
the
douvres
one
thing
emerged
the
engines
were
intact
to
rescue
the
durande
was
impossible
but
the
machinery
might
still
be
saved
these
engines
were
unique
to
construct
others
like
them
money
was
wanting
but
to
find
the
artificer
would
have
been
still
more
difficult
the
constructor
was
dead
the
machinery
had
cost
two
thousand
pounds
as
long
as
these
engines
existed
it
might
almost
be
said
that
there
was
no
shipwreck
the
loss
of
the
engines
alone
was
irreparable
now
if
ever
a
dream
had
appeared
wild
and
impracticable
it
was
that
of
saving
the
engines
then
embedded
between
the
douvres
the
idea
of
sending
a
crew
to
work
upon
those
rocks
was
absurd
it
was
the
season
of
heavy
seas
besides
on
the
narrow
ledge
of
the
highest
part
of
the
rock
there
was
scarcely
room
for
one
person
to
save
the
engines
therefore
it
would
be
necessary
for
a
man
to
go
to
the
douvres
to
be
alone
in
that
sea
alone
at
five
leagues
from
the
coast
alone
in
that
region
of
terrors
for
entire
weeks
in
the
presence
of
dangers
foreseen
and
unforeseen
without
supplies
in
the
face
of
hunger
and
nakedness
without
companionship
save
that
of
death
a
pilot
present
in
the
room
delivered
judgment
no
it
is
all
over
the
man
does
not
exist
who
could
go
there
and
rescue
the
machinery
of
the
durande
if
i
do
go
said
the
engineer
of
the
lost
ship
who
loved
those
engines
it
is
because
nobody
could
do
it
if
he
existed
continued
the
pilot
dérouchette
turned
her
head
impulsively
and
interrupted
i
would
marry
him
she
said
innocently
there
was
a
pause
a
man
made
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
and
standing
before
her
pale
and
anxious
said
you
would
marry
him
miss
dérouchette
it
was
gilliatt
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
him
lethierry
had
just
before
stood
upright
and
gazed
about
him
his
eyes
glittered
with
a
strange
light
he
took
off
his
sailor
cap
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
then
looked
solemnly
before
him
and
without
seeing
any
of
the
persons
present
said
dérouchette
should
be
his
i
pledge
myself
to
it
in
name
the
prey
of
the
the
two
perpendicular
forms
called
the
douvres
held
fast
between
them
like
an
architrave
between
two
pillars
the
wreck
of
the
durande
the
spectacle
thus
presented
was
a
vast
portal
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
it
might
have
been
a
titanic
cromlech
planted
there
in
by
hands
accustomed
to
proportion
their
labours
to
the
great
deep
its
wild
outline
stood
well
defined
against
the
clear
sky
when
gilliatt
approached
in
his
sloop
the
rocks
thus
holding
fast
and
exhibiting
their
prey
were
terrible
to
behold
there
was
a
menace
in
the
attitude
of
the
rocks
they
seemed
to
be
biding
their
time
nothing
could
be
more
suggestive
of
haughtiness
and
arrogance
the
conquered
vessel
the
triumphant
abyss
the
two
rocks
still
streaming
with
the
tempest
of
the
day
before
were
like
two
wrestlers
sweating
from
a
recent
struggle
up
to
a
certain
height
they
were
completely
bearded
with
seaweed
above
this
their
steep
haunches
glittered
at
points
like
polished
armour
they
seemed
ready
to
begin
the
strife
again
the
imagination
might
have
pictured
them
as
two
monstrous
arms
reaching
upwards
from
the
gulf
and
exhibiting
to
the
tempest
the
lifeless
body
of
the
ship
if
gilliatt
had
known
how
she
came
to
be
there
he
might
have
been
more
awed
by
the
tremendous
spectacle
the
cause
was
an
accident
and
yet
a
purposed
act
clubin
the
captain
as
smug
a
hypocrite
as
ever
scuttled
a
ship
had
intended
to
run
the
durande
on
the
hanways
his
belt
contained
three
thousand
pounds
he
meant
to
lose
the
ship
on
the
hanways
a
mile
from
shore
and
when
the
passengers
had
rowed
away
pretending
that
he
would
go
down
with
the
ship
clubin
purposed
to
swim
to
land
get
on
board
a
pirate
ship
and
be
off
to
the
east
his
little
drama
had
been
acted
out
the
boats
had
rowed
away
everybody
praising
captain
clubin
who
would
not
abandon
his
ship
but
when
the
fog
cleared
horror
of
horrors
clubin
found
himself
not
on
the
hanways
but
on
the
douvres
not
one
mile
from
shore
but
five
miles
clubin
saw
a
ship
in
the
distance
he
determined
to
swim
to
a
rock
from
which
he
could
be
seen
and
make
signals
of
distress
he
undressed
leaving
his
clothing
on
deck
he
retained
nothing
but
his
leather
belt
and
then
precipitating
himself
head
first
plunged
into
the
sea
as
he
dived
from
a
height
he
plunged
heavily
he
sank
deep
in
the
water
touched
the
bottom
skirted
for
a
moment
the
submarine
rocks
then
struck
out
to
regain
the
surface
at
that
moment
he
felt
himself
seized
by
one
foot
but
of
all
this
gilliatt
arriving
at
the
douvres
knew
nothing
he
was
absorbed
by
the
spectacle
of
the
ship
held
in
and
what
did
he
find
the
machinery
was
saved
but
it
was
lost
the
ocean
saved
it
only
to
demolish
it
at
leisure
like
a
cat
playing
with
her
prey
its
fate
was
to
suffer
there
and
to
be
dismembered
day
by
day
it
was
to
be
the
plaything
of
the
savage
amusements
of
the
sea
for
what
could
be
done
that
this
vast
block
of
mechanism
and
gear
at
once
massive
and
delicate
condemned
to
fixity
by
its
weight
delivered
up
in
that
solitude
to
the
destructive
elements
could
under
the
frown
of
that
implacable
spot
escape
from
slow
destruction
seemed
a
madness
even
to
imagine
gilliatt
looked
about
him
when
he
had
made
a
lodging
for
himself
and
had
suffered
the
misfortune
of
losing
the
basket
containing
his
provisions
gilliatt
considered
his
difficulties
in
order
to
raise
the
engine
of
the
durande
from
the
wreck
in
which
it
was
buried
with
any
chance
of
success
in
order
to
accomplish
a
salvage
in
such
a
place
and
such
a
season
it
seemed
almost
necessary
to
be
a
legion
of
men
gilliatt
was
alone
a
complete
apparatus
of
carpenter
and
engineer
tools
and
implements
were
wanted
gilliatt
had
a
saw
a
hatchet
a
chisel
and
a
hammer
he
wanted
both
a
good
workshop
and
a
good
shed
gilliatt
had
not
a
roof
to
cover
him
provisions
too
were
necessary
on
that
bare
rock
but
he
had
not
even
bread
anyone
who
could
have
seen
gilliatt
working
on
the
rock
during
all
that
first
week
might
have
been
puzzled
to
determine
the
nature
of
his
operations
he
seemed
to
be
no
longer
thinking
of
the
durande
or
the
two
douvres
he
was
busy
only
among
the
breakers
he
seemed
absorbed
in
saving
the
smaller
parts
of
the
shipwreck
he
took
advantage
of
every
high
tide
to
strip
the
reefs
of
everything
that
the
had
distributed
among
them
he
went
from
rock
to
rock
picking
up
whatever
the
sea
had
scattered
tatters
of
pieces
of
iron
splinters
of
panels
shattered
planking
broken
yards
here
a
beam
there
a
chain
there
a
pulley
he
lived
upon
limpets
and
he
was
surrounded
by
a
screaming
garrison
of
gulls
cormorants
and
the
deep
boom
of
the
waves
among
the
caves
and
reefs
was
never
out
of
his
ears
by
day
he
was
roasted
in
the
terrific
heat
which
beat
with
pitiless
force
on
this
exposed
pinnacle
at
night
he
was
chilled
to
the
marrow
by
the
cold
of
the
open
sea
and
for
ever
he
was
hungry
thirsty
famished
one
day
in
exploring
for
salvage
some
of
the
grottoes
of
his
rock
gilliatt
came
upon
a
cave
within
a
cave
so
beautiful
with
that
it
seemed
the
retreat
of
a
the
shells
were
like
jewels
the
water
held
eternal
moonlight
some
of
the
flowers
were
like
sapphires
standing
in
this
dripping
grotto
with
his
feet
on
the
edge
of
a
probably
bottomless
pool
gilliatt
suddenly
became
aware
in
the
transparence
of
that
water
of
the
approach
of
some
mystic
form
a
species
of
long
ragged
band
was
moving
amid
the
oscillation
of
the
waves
it
did
not
float
but
darted
about
at
its
own
will
it
had
an
object
was
advancing
somewhere
rapidly
the
thing
had
something
of
the
form
of
a
jester
bauble
with
points
which
hung
flabby
and
undulating
it
seemed
covered
with
a
dust
incapable
of
being
washed
away
by
the
water
it
was
more
than
horrible
it
was
foul
it
seemed
to
be
seeking
the
darker
portion
of
the
cavern
where
at
last
it
vanished
gilliatt
returned
to
his
work
he
had
a
notion
since
the
time
of
the
of
salbris
who
in
the
sixteenth
century
without
other
helper
than
a
child
his
son
with
tools
in
the
chamber
of
the
great
clock
at
la
resolved
at
one
stroke
five
or
six
problems
in
statics
and
dynamics
inextricably
intervolved
since
the
time
of
that
grand
and
marvellous
achievement
of
the
poor
workman
who
found
means
without
breaking
a
single
piece
of
wire
without
throwing
one
of
the
teeth
of
the
wheels
out
of
gear
to
lower
in
one
piece
by
a
marvellous
simplification
from
the
second
story
of
the
clock
tower
to
the
first
that
massive
clock
large
as
a
room
nothing
that
could
be
compared
with
the
project
which
gilliatt
was
meditating
had
ever
been
attempted
after
incredible
exertions
the
machinery
was
ready
for
lowering
into
the
sloop
gilliatt
had
constructed
tackle
a
regulating
gear
and
made
all
sure
the
long
labour
was
finished
the
first
act
had
been
the
simplest
of
all
he
could
put
to
sea
he
would
be
in
guernsey
but
no
he
had
waited
for
the
tide
to
lift
the
sloop
as
near
to
the
suspended
engines
as
possible
and
now
the
funnel
which
he
had
lowered
with
the
prevented
the
sloop
from
getting
out
of
the
little
gorge
it
was
necessary
to
wait
for
the
tide
to
fall
gilliatt
drew
his
sheepskin
about
him
pulled
his
cap
over
his
eyes
and
lying
down
beside
the
engine
was
soon
asleep
when
he
woke
it
was
to
feel
the
coming
of
a
storm
a
fresh
task
was
forced
upon
this
famished
man
it
was
necessary
to
build
a
breakwater
in
the
gorge
he
flew
to
this
task
nails
driven
into
the
cracks
of
the
rocks
beams
lashed
together
with
cordage
from
the
durande
binding
strakes
chains
with
these
materials
the
haggard
dweller
of
the
rock
built
his
barrier
against
the
wrath
of
god
then
the
storm
came
the
when
the
awful
rage
of
the
storm
had
passed
and
the
barrier
which
he
had
repaired
in
the
midst
of
the
tempest
hung
like
a
broken
arm
across
the
gorge
gilliatt
maddened
by
hunger
took
advantage
of
the
receding
tide
to
go
in
search
of
crayfish
half
naked
and
with
his
open
knife
between
his
teeth
he
sprang
from
rock
to
rock
in
hunting
a
crab
he
found
himself
once
more
in
the
mysterious
grotto
that
glittered
with
flowers
he
noticed
a
fissure
above
the
level
of
the
water
the
crab
was
probably
there
he
thrust
in
his
hand
as
far
as
he
was
able
and
groped
about
in
that
dusky
aperture
suddenly
he
felt
himself
seized
by
the
arm
a
strange
indescribable
horror
thrilled
through
him
some
living
thing
thin
rough
flat
cold
slimy
had
twisted
itself
round
his
naked
arm
it
crept
upward
towards
his
chest
its
pressure
was
like
a
tightening
cord
its
steady
persistence
like
that
of
a
screw
in
less
than
a
moment
some
mysterious
spiral
form
had
passed
round
his
wrist
and
elbow
and
had
reached
his
shoulder
a
sharp
point
penetrated
beneath
the
gilliatt
recoiled
but
he
had
scarcely
power
to
move
he
was
as
it
were
nailed
to
the
place
with
his
left
hand
which
was
disengaged
he
seized
his
knife
and
made
a
desperate
effort
to
withdraw
his
arm
he
only
succeeded
in
disturbing
his
persecutor
which
wound
itself
still
tighter
it
was
supple
as
leather
strong
as
steel
cold
as
night
a
second
form
sharp
elongated
and
narrow
issued
out
of
the
crevice
like
a
tongue
out
of
monstrous
jaws
it
seemed
to
lick
his
naked
body
then
suddenly
stretching
out
it
became
longer
and
thinner
as
it
crept
over
his
skin
and
wound
itself
round
him
a
terrible
sense
of
anguish
comparable
to
nothing
he
had
ever
known
compelled
all
his
muscles
to
contract
he
felt
upon
his
skin
a
number
of
flat
rounded
points
it
seemed
as
if
innumerable
suckers
had
fastened
to
his
flesh
and
were
about
to
drink
his
blood
a
third
long
undulating
shape
issued
from
the
hole
in
the
rock
felt
about
his
body
lashed
round
his
ribs
like
a
cord
and
fixed
itself
there
there
was
sufficient
light
for
gilliatt
to
see
the
repulsive
forms
which
had
entangled
themselves
about
him
a
fourth
ligature
but
this
one
swift
as
an
arrow
darted
towards
his
stomach
these
living
things
crept
and
glided
about
him
he
felt
the
points
of
pressure
like
sucking
mouths
change
their
places
from
time
to
time
suddenly
a
large
round
flattened
glutinous
mass
shot
from
beneath
the
crevice
it
was
the
centre
the
thongs
were
attached
to
it
like
spokes
to
the
nave
of
a
wheel
in
the
middle
of
this
slimy
mass
appeared
two
eyes
the
eyes
were
fixed
on
gilliatt
he
recognised
the
gilliatt
had
but
one
resource
his
knife
he
knew
that
these
frightful
monsters
are
vulnerable
in
only
one
point
the
head
standing
half
naked
in
the
water
his
body
lashed
by
the
foul
antennae
of
the
gilliatt
looked
at
the
and
the
devilfish
looked
at
gilliatt
with
the
as
with
a
furious
bull
there
is
a
certain
moment
in
the
conflict
which
must
be
seized
it
is
the
instant
when
the
bull
lowers
its
neck
it
is
the
instant
when
the
advances
its
head
the
movement
is
rapid
he
who
loses
that
moment
is
destroyed
suddenly
it
loosened
another
antenna
from
the
rock
and
darting
it
at
him
seized
him
by
the
left
arm
at
the
same
moment
it
advanced
its
head
rapid
as
was
this
movement
gilliatt
by
a
gigantic
effort
plunged
the
blade
of
his
knife
into
the
flat
slimy
substance
and
with
a
movement
like
the
flourish
of
a
whip
described
a
circle
round
the
eyes
and
wrenched
off
the
head
as
a
man
would
draw
a
tooth
the
four
hundred
suckers
dropped
at
once
from
the
man
and
the
rock
the
mass
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
water
nearly
exhausted
gilliatt
plunged
into
the
water
to
heal
by
friction
the
numberless
purple
swellings
which
were
pricking
all
over
his
body
he
advanced
up
the
recess
something
caught
his
eye
he
approached
nearer
the
thing
was
a
bleached
skeleton
nothing
was
left
but
the
white
bones
yes
something
else
a
leather
belt
and
a
on
the
belt
gilliatt
read
the
name
of
clubin
in
the
which
he
opened
with
his
knife
he
found
three
thousand
pounds
when
gilliatt
reached
his
sloop
with
this
belt
and
box
in
his
possession
he
found
to
his
unspeakable
horror
that
she
had
been
making
water
fast
had
he
come
an
hour
later
he
would
have
found
nothing
above
water
but
the
funnel
of
the
steamer
he
slung
a
tarpaulin
by
chains
overboard
and
hung
it
over
the
hole
pressure
of
the
sea
held
it
tight
the
wound
was
stanched
gilliatt
began
to
bale
for
dear
life
as
he
emptied
the
hole
the
tarpaulin
bulged
in
as
if
a
fist
were
pushing
it
from
outside
he
ran
for
his
clothes
brought
them
and
stuffed
them
into
the
wound
he
was
saved
for
a
few
moments
death
was
certain
he
had
succeeded
in
the
impossible
to
fail
in
what
a
shipwright
might
have
mended
in
a
few
minutes
upon
that
solitary
rock
he
had
been
subjected
by
turns
to
all
the
varied
and
cruel
tortures
of
nature
he
had
conquered
his
isolation
conquered
hunger
conquered
thirst
conquered
cold
conquered
fever
conquered
labour
conquered
sleep
a
dismal
irony
was
then
the
end
of
all
gilliatt
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
rock
and
gazed
wildly
into
space
he
had
no
clothing
he
stood
naked
in
the
midst
of
that
immensity
then
overwhelmed
by
the
sense
of
that
unknown
infinity
like
one
bewildered
by
a
strange
persecution
confronting
the
shadows
of
night
in
the
midst
of
the
murmur
of
the
waves
the
swell
the
foam
the
breeze
under
that
vast
diffusion
of
force
having
around
him
and
beneath
him
the
ocean
above
him
the
constellations
under
him
the
great
unfathomable
deep
he
sank
gave
up
the
struggle
laid
down
upon
the
rock
humbled
and
uplifting
his
joined
hands
towards
the
terrible
depths
he
cried
aloud
have
mercy
when
he
issued
from
his
swoon
the
sun
was
high
in
a
cloudless
sky
the
blessed
heat
had
saved
the
poor
broken
naked
man
upon
the
rock
he
rose
up
refreshed
and
filled
with
divine
energy
a
day
work
sufficed
to
mend
the
gap
in
the
sloop
side
on
the
following
day
dressed
in
the
tattered
garments
which
had
stuffed
the
rent
with
a
favourable
breeze
and
a
good
sea
gilliatt
pushed
off
from
the
douvres
fate
last
gilliatt
arrived
in
harbour
at
night
he
went
ashore
in
his
rags
and
hovered
for
a
while
about
the
darkness
of
lethierry
house
then
he
made
his
way
into
the
garden
like
an
animal
returning
to
its
hole
he
sat
himself
down
and
looked
about
him
he
saw
the
garden
the
pathways
the
beds
of
flowers
the
house
the
two
windows
of
chamber
he
felt
it
horrible
to
be
obliged
to
breathe
he
did
what
he
could
to
prevent
it
to
see
those
windows
was
almost
too
much
happiness
for
gilliatt
suddenly
he
saw
her
dérouchette
approached
she
stopped
she
walked
back
a
few
paces
stopped
again
then
returned
and
sat
upon
a
wooden
bench
the
moon
was
in
the
trees
a
few
clouds
floated
among
the
pale
stars
the
sea
murmured
to
the
shadows
in
an
undertone
gilliatt
felt
a
thrill
through
him
he
was
the
most
miserable
and
yet
the
happiest
of
men
he
knew
not
what
to
do
his
delirious
joy
at
seeing
her
annihilated
him
he
gazed
upon
her
neck
her
hair
a
noise
aroused
them
both
her
from
her
reverie
him
from
his
ecstasy
someone
was
walking
in
the
garden
it
was
the
footsteps
of
a
man
dérouchette
raised
her
eyes
the
footsteps
drew
nearer
then
ceased
accident
had
so
placed
the
branches
that
dérouchette
could
see
the
newcomer
while
gilliatt
could
not
he
looked
at
dérouchette
she
was
quite
pale
her
mouth
was
partly
open
as
with
a
suppressed
cry
of
surprise
her
surprise
was
enchantment
mingled
with
timidity
she
seemed
as
if
transfigured
by
that
presence
as
if
the
being
whom
she
saw
before
her
belonged
not
to
this
earth
the
stranger
who
was
to
gilliatt
only
a
shadow
spoke
a
voice
issued
from
the
trees
softer
than
the
voice
of
a
woman
yet
it
was
the
voice
of
a
man
gilliatt
heard
many
words
then
mademoiselle
you
are
poor
since
this
morning
i
am
rich
will
you
have
me
for
your
husband
i
love
you
god
made
not
the
heart
of
man
to
be
silent
he
has
promised
him
eternity
with
the
intention
that
he
should
not
be
alone
there
is
for
me
but
one
woman
on
the
earth
it
is
you
i
think
of
you
as
of
a
prayer
my
faith
is
in
god
and
my
hope
in
you
gilliatt
heard
them
talking
the
woman
he
loved
the
man
whose
shadow
lay
upon
the
path
presently
he
heard
the
invisible
man
exclaim
mademoiselle
you
are
silent
what
would
you
have
me
say
the
man
said
i
wait
for
your
reply
god
has
heard
it
answered
dérouchette
then
she
went
forward
a
moment
afterwards
instead
of
one
shadow
upon
the
path
there
were
two
they
mingled
together
and
became
one
gilliatt
saw
at
his
feet
the
embrace
of
those
two
shadows
suddenly
a
noise
burst
forth
at
a
distance
a
voice
was
heard
crying
help
and
the
harbour
bell
rang
out
on
the
night
air
it
was
lethierry
ringing
the
bell
furiously
he
had
wakened
and
seen
the
funnel
of
the
durande
in
the
harbour
the
sight
had
driven
him
almost
crazy
he
rushed
out
crying
help
and
pulling
the
great
bell
of
the
harbour
suddenly
he
stopped
abruptly
a
man
had
just
turned
the
corner
of
the
quay
it
was
gilliatt
lethierry
rushed
at
him
embraced
him
hugged
him
cried
over
him
and
dragged
him
into
the
lower
room
of
the
bravées
give
me
your
word
that
i
am
not
crazy
he
kept
crying
it
ca
be
true
not
a
tap
not
a
pin
missing
it
is
incredible
we
have
only
to
put
in
a
little
oil
what
a
revolution
you
are
my
child
my
son
my
providence
brave
lad
to
go
and
fetch
my
good
old
engine
in
the
open
sea
among
those
rocks
i
have
seen
some
strange
things
in
my
life
nothing
like
that
gilliatt
gave
him
the
belt
and
the
box
containing
the
three
thousand
pounds
stolen
by
clubin
again
lethierry
was
thrown
into
a
wild
amazement
did
anyone
ever
see
a
man
like
gilliatt
he
concluded
i
was
struck
down
to
the
ground
i
was
a
dead
man
he
comes
and
sets
me
up
again
as
firm
as
ever
and
all
the
while
i
was
never
thinking
of
him
he
had
gone
clean
out
of
my
mind
but
i
recollect
everything
now
poor
lad
ah
by
the
way
you
know
you
are
to
marry
dérouchette
gilliatt
leaned
with
his
back
against
the
wall
like
one
who
staggers
and
said
in
a
tone
very
low
but
distinct
no
lethierry
started
how
no
i
do
not
love
her
lethierry
laughed
that
idea
to
scorn
he
was
wild
with
joy
gilliatt
his
son
his
preserver
should
marry
dérouchette
he
and
none
other
neighbours
had
begun
to
flock
in
roused
by
the
bell
the
room
was
crowded
dérouchette
presently
glided
in
and
was
espied
by
lethierry
in
the
crowd
he
seized
her
told
her
the
news
we
are
rich
again
and
you
shall
marry
the
prodigy
who
has
done
this
thing
his
eye
fell
upon
the
man
who
had
followed
dérouchette
into
the
room
it
was
the
young
priest
whom
gilliatt
had
rescued
from
the
seat
in
the
rock
ah
you
are
there
monsieur
le
curé
exclaimed
the
old
man
you
will
marry
these
young
people
for
us
there
a
fine
fellow
he
cried
and
pointed
to
gilliatt
gilliatt
appearance
was
hideous
he
was
in
the
condition
in
which
he
had
that
morning
set
sail
from
the
rocks
in
rags
his
bare
elbows
showing
through
his
sleeves
his
beard
long
his
hair
rough
and
wild
his
eyes
bloodshot
his
skin
peeling
his
hands
covered
with
wounds
his
feet
naked
and
torn
some
of
the
blisters
left
by
the
were
still
visible
upon
his
arms
this
is
my
cried
lethierry
how
he
has
struggled
with
the
sea
he
is
all
in
rags
what
shoulders
what
hands
there
a
splendid
fellow
but
lethierry
did
not
know
gilliatt
the
poor
broken
creature
escaped
from
the
room
he
himself
made
all
the
arrangements
for
the
marriage
of
the
priest
and
dérouchette
he
placed
the
special
license
in
their
hands
secured
a
priest
for
the
purpose
and
secured
passages
for
them
in
the
ship
waiting
in
the
roads
for
england
when
he
had
done
all
this
he
made
his
way
to
the
seat
in
the
cliff
and
sat
there
waiting
to
see
the
ship
appear
round
the
bight
and
disappear
on
the
horizon
the
ship
appeared
with
the
slowness
of
a
phantom
gilliatt
watched
it
suddenly
a
touch
and
a
sensation
of
cold
caused
him
to
look
down
the
sea
had
reached
his
feet
he
lowered
his
eyes
then
raised
them
again
the
ship
was
quite
near
the
rock
in
which
the
rains
had
hollowed
out
this
giant
seat
was
so
completely
vertical
and
there
was
so
much
water
at
its
base
that
in
calm
weather
vessels
were
able
to
pass
without
danger
within
a
few
cables
length
the
ship
was
already
abreast
of
the
rock
gilliatt
could
see
the
stir
of
life
on
the
sunlit
deck
the
deck
was
as
visible
as
if
he
had
stood
upon
it
he
saw
bride
and
bridegroom
sitting
side
by
side
like
two
birds
warming
themselves
in
the
noonday
sun
a
celestial
light
was
in
those
two
faces
formed
by
innocence
the
silence
was
like
the
calm
of
heaven
the
vessel
passed
he
watched
her
till
her
masts
and
sails
formed
only
a
white
obelisk
gradually
decreasing
against
the
horizon
he
felt
that
the
water
had
reached
his
waist
and
cormorants
flew
about
him
restlessly
as
if
anxious
to
warn
him
of
his
danger
the
ship
was
rapidly
growing
less
there
was
no
foam
around
the
rock
where
he
sat
no
wave
beat
against
its
granite
sides
the
water
rose
peacefully
it
was
nearly
level
with
gilliatt
shoulders
the
birds
were
hovering
about
him
uttering
short
cries
only
his
head
was
now
visible
the
tide
was
nearly
at
the
full
evening
was
approaching
gilliatt
eyes
continued
fixed
upon
the
vessel
on
the
horizon
their
expression
resembled
nothing
earthly
a
strange
lustre
shone
in
their
calm
and
tragic
depths
there
was
in
them
the
peace
of
vanished
hopes
the
calm
but
sorrowful
acceptance
of
an
end
far
different
from
his
dreams
by
degrees
the
dusk
of
heaven
began
to
dawn
in
them
though
gazing
still
upon
the
point
in
space
at
the
same
moment
the
wide
waters
round
the
rock
and
the
vast
gathering
twilight
closed
upon
them
at
the
moment
when
the
vessel
vanished
on
the
horizon
the
head
of
gilliatt
disappeared
nothing
now
was
visible
but
the
sea
the
man
who
laughs
the
man
who
laughs
qui
rit
was
called
by
its
author
a
romance
of
english
history
and
was
written
during
the
period
hugo
spent
in
exile
in
guernsey
like
the
toilers
of
the
sea
its
immediate
predecessor
the
main
theme
of
the
story
is
human
heroism
confronted
with
the
superhuman
tyranny
of
blind
chance
as
a
passionate
cry
on
behalf
of
the
tortured
and
deformed
and
the
despised
and
oppressed
of
the
world
the
man
who
laughs
is
irresistible
of
it
hugo
himself
says
in
the
preface
the
true
title
of
this
book
should
be
inasmuch
as
it
was
intended
as
an
arraignment
of
the
nobility
for
their
vices
crimes
and
selfishness
the
man
who
laughs
was
first
published
in
the
ursus
and
homo
were
old
friends
ursus
was
a
man
homo
a
wolf
the
two
went
about
together
from
town
to
town
from
to
ursus
lived
in
a
small
van
upon
wheels
which
homo
drew
by
day
and
guarded
by
night
ursus
was
a
juggler
a
ventriloquist
a
doctor
and
a
misanthrope
he
was
also
something
of
a
poet
the
wolf
and
he
had
grown
old
together
one
bitterly
cold
night
in
january
when
ursus
and
his
van
were
at
weymouth
a
small
vessel
put
off
from
portland
it
contained
a
dozen
people
and
it
left
behind
on
the
rock
and
alone
a
small
boy
the
people
were
called
comprachicos
they
bought
children
and
understood
how
to
mutilate
and
deform
them
thus
making
them
valuable
for
exhibition
at
fairs
but
an
act
of
parliament
had
just
been
passed
to
destroy
the
trade
of
the
comprachicos
hence
this
flight
from
portland
and
the
forsaking
of
the
child
the
vessel
was
wrecked
and
all
on
board
perished
off
the
coast
of
france
but
not
before
one
of
the
passengers
had
inscribed
on
a
piece
of
parchment
the
name
of
the
child
and
the
name
of
a
certain
english
prisoner
who
could
identify
the
child
this
parchment
was
sealed
in
a
bottle
and
left
to
the
waves
the
child
watched
the
disappearance
of
the
boat
he
was
stupefied
at
finding
himself
alone
the
men
who
had
left
him
were
the
only
people
he
had
ever
known
and
they
had
failed
him
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
but
he
knew
that
he
must
seek
food
and
shelter
it
was
very
cold
and
dark
and
the
boy
was
barefoot
but
he
made
his
way
across
portland
and
the
chesil
bank
and
gained
the
mainland
he
found
in
the
snow
a
footprint
and
set
out
to
follow
it
presently
he
heard
a
groan
and
came
to
the
end
of
the
footprints
the
woman
a
who
had
lost
her
way
had
uttered
the
groan
she
had
sunk
down
in
the
snow
and
was
dead
when
the
boy
found
her
he
heard
a
cry
and
discovered
a
baby
wretched
with
cold
but
still
alive
clinging
to
its
dead
mother
breast
the
boy
took
the
baby
in
his
arms
forsaken
himself
he
had
heard
the
cry
of
distress
and
wrapping
the
infant
in
his
coat
he
pursued
his
journey
in
the
teeth
of
the
freezing
wind
four
hours
had
passed
since
the
boat
had
sailed
away
this
baby
was
the
first
living
person
the
boy
had
met
struggling
along
with
his
burden
the
boy
reached
weymouth
then
a
hamlet
and
a
suburb
of
the
town
and
port
of
melcombe
regis
he
knocked
at
doors
and
windows
no
one
stirred
for
one
thing
everybody
was
asleep
and
those
who
were
awakened
by
the
knock
were
afraid
of
opening
a
window
for
fear
of
some
sick
vagabond
being
outside
suddenly
the
boy
heard
in
the
darkness
a
grinding
of
teeth
and
a
growl
the
silence
was
so
dreadful
that
he
was
glad
of
the
noise
and
moved
in
the
direction
whence
it
came
he
saw
a
carriage
on
wheels
with
smoke
coming
out
of
the
roof
through
a
funnel
and
a
light
within
something
perceived
his
approach
and
growled
furiously
and
tugged
at
its
chain
at
the
same
time
a
head
was
put
out
of
a
window
in
the
van
be
quiet
there
said
the
head
and
the
noise
ceased
is
anyone
there
said
the
head
again
yes
i
said
the
child
you
who
are
you
i
am
very
tired
and
cold
and
hungry
said
the
child
we
ca
all
be
as
happy
as
a
lord
go
away
said
the
head
and
the
window
was
shut
down
the
child
turned
away
in
despair
but
no
sooner
was
the
window
shut
than
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
steps
opened
and
the
same
voice
called
out
from
within
the
van
well
why
do
you
come
in
what
sort
of
a
fellow
is
this
who
is
cold
and
hungry
and
who
stays
outside
the
boy
climbed
up
the
three
steps
with
difficulty
carrying
the
baby
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
at
the
door
on
the
ceiling
was
written
in
large
letters
ursus
philosopher
it
was
the
house
of
ursus
the
child
had
come
to
homo
had
been
growling
ursus
speaking
the
child
made
out
near
the
stove
an
elderly
man
who
as
he
stood
reached
the
roof
of
the
caravan
come
in
put
down
your
bundle
said
ursus
how
wet
you
are
and
half
frozen
take
off
those
rags
you
young
villain
he
tore
off
the
boy
rags
clothed
him
in
a
man
shirt
and
a
knitted
jacket
rubbed
the
boy
limbs
and
feet
with
a
woollen
rag
found
there
was
nothing
and
gave
him
his
own
scanty
supper
to
eat
i
have
worked
all
day
and
far
into
the
night
on
an
empty
stomach
muttered
ursus
and
now
this
dreadful
boy
swallows
up
my
food
however
it
all
one
he
shall
have
the
bread
the
potato
and
the
bacon
but
i
will
have
the
milk
just
then
the
infant
began
to
wail
ursus
fed
it
with
the
milk
by
means
of
a
small
bottle
took
off
the
tatters
in
which
it
was
wrapped
and
swathed
it
in
a
large
piece
of
dry
clean
linen
when
the
boy
had
finished
his
supper
ursus
asked
him
who
he
was
but
he
could
get
no
answer
save
that
he
had
been
abandoned
that
night
but
you
must
have
relations
since
you
have
this
baby
sister
it
is
not
my
sister
it
is
a
baby
that
i
found
ursus
listened
to
the
boy
story
then
he
brought
out
an
old
bearskin
laid
it
on
a
chest
placed
the
sleeping
infant
on
this
and
told
the
boy
to
lie
down
beside
the
baby
ursus
rolled
the
bearskin
over
the
children
tucked
it
under
their
feet
and
went
out
into
the
night
to
see
if
the
woman
could
be
saved
he
returned
at
dawn
his
efforts
had
been
fruitless
the
boy
had
awakened
at
hearing
ursus
and
for
the
first
time
the
latter
saw
his
face
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
are
frightful
who
did
that
to
you
said
ursus
the
boy
answered
i
am
not
laughing
i
have
always
been
like
this
ursus
turned
away
and
muttered
i
thought
that
sort
of
work
was
out
of
date
he
took
down
an
old
book
and
read
in
latin
that
by
slitting
the
mouth
and
performing
other
operations
in
childhood
the
face
would
become
a
mask
whose
owner
would
be
always
laughing
at
that
moment
the
infant
awoke
and
ursus
gave
it
what
was
left
of
the
milk
the
baby
girl
was
blind
ursus
had
already
decided
that
he
and
homo
would
adopt
the
two
children
gwynplaine
and
gwynplaine
was
a
mountebank
as
soon
as
he
exhibited
himself
all
who
saw
him
laughed
his
laugh
created
the
laughter
of
others
though
he
did
not
laugh
himself
it
was
his
face
only
that
laughed
and
laughed
always
with
an
everlasting
laugh
fifteen
years
had
passed
since
the
night
when
the
boy
came
to
the
caravan
at
weymouth
and
gwynplaine
was
now
ursus
had
kept
the
two
children
with
him
the
blind
girl
he
called
dea

boy
said

had
always
been
called
gwynplaine
of

the
two
were
in
love

adored
dea
and
dea
idolised
gwynplaine
you

beautiful
she
would
say
to
him
the
crowd

his
face
for
dea
gwynplaine
was
the
person
who
had
saved
her
from
the
tomb
and
who
was
always
kind
and
the
blind
see
the
invisible
said
ursus

great
van

hung
up
with
the
following
inscription
composed
by

and
crowds
came
from
the
city
to
the
tadcaster
inn

was
not
long
before
the
fashionable

itself
was
drawn

an
old
man

closer
said
the
sheriff
to

then
he
addressed

looked
at

and
then
cried

him
registrar
take
down
that
statement
said
the
sheriff
the
cry
of
the
prisoner
overwhelmed
gwynplaine
he
was
terrified
by
a
confession
that
was
unintelligible
to
him
and
began
in
his
distress
to
stammer
and
protest
his
innocence
have
pity
on
me
my
lord
you
have
before
you
only
a
poor
mountebank
i
have
before
me
said
the
sheriff
lord
fermain
clancharlie
baron
clancharlie
and
hunkerville
and
a
peer
of
england
then
the
sheriff
rising
offered
his
seat
with
a
bow
to
gwynplaine
saying
my
lord
will
you
please
to
be
seated
the
house
of
before
he
left
the
prison
the
sheriff
explained
to
gwynplaine
how
it
was
he
was
lord
clancharlie
the
bottle
containing
the
documents
which
had
been
thrown
into
the
sea
in
january
had
at
last
come
to
shore
and
had
been
duly
received
at
the
admiralty
by
a
high
official
named
barkilphedro
this
document
declared
that
the
child
abandoned
by
those
on
the
sinking
vessel
was
the
only
child
of
lord
fermain
clancharlie
deceased
at
the
age
of
two
it
had
been
sold
disfigured
and
put
out
of
the
way
by
order
of
king
james
ii
its
parents
were
dead
and
a
man
named
hardquanonne
now
in
prison
at
chatham
had
performed
the
mutilation
and
would
recognise
the
child
who
was
called
gwynplaine
being
about
to
die
the
signatories
to
the
document
confessed
their
guilt
in
abducting
the
child
and
could
not
in
the
face
of
death
refrain
from
acknowledgment
of
their
crime
the
prisoner
hardquanonne
had
been
found
at
chatham
and
he
had
recognised
gwynplaine
hardquanonne
died
of
the
tortures
he
had
suffered
but
just
before
his
death
he
said
i
swore
to
keep
the
secret
and
i
have
kept
it
as
long
as
i
could
we
did
it
between
us
the
king
and
i
silence
is
no
longer
any
good
this
is
the
man
what
was
the
reason
for
the
hatred
of
james
ii
to
the
child
this
lord
clancharlie
had
taken
the
side
of
cromwell
against
charles
and
had
gone
into
exile
in
switzerland
rather
than
acknowledge
charles
ii
as
king
on
the
death
of
this
nobleman
james
ii
had
declared
his
estates
forfeit
and
the
title
extinct
believing
that
the
heir
was
lost
beyond
possible
recovery
on
david
an
illegitimate
son
of
lord
clancharlie
were
the
peerage
and
estates
conferred
on
condition
that
he
married
a
certain
duchess
josiana
an
illegitimate
daughter
of
james
ii
how
was
it
gwynplaine
was
restored
to
his
inheritance
anne
was
queen
of
england
when
the
bottle
was
taken
to
the
admiralty
in
and
shared
with
the
high
official
whose
business
it
was
to
attend
to
all
flotsam
and
jetsam
a
cordial
dislike
of
duchess
josiana
it
seemed
to
the
queen
an
excellent
thing
that
josiana
should
have
to
marry
this
frightful
man
and
as
for
david
he
could
be
made
an
admiral
anne
consulted
the
lord
chancellor
privately
and
he
strongly
advised
without
blaming
james
that
gwynplaine
must
be
restored
to
the
peerage
gwynplaine
without
having
time
to
return
to
the
green
box
was
carried
off
by
barkilphedro
to
one
of
his
country
houses
near
windsor
and
bidden
the
next
day
take
his
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
he
had
entered
the
terrible
prison
in
southwark
expecting
the
iron
collar
of
a
felon
and
he
had
placed
on
his
head
the
coronet
of
a
peer
barkilphedro
had
told
him
that
a
man
could
not
be
made
a
peer
without
his
own
consent
that
gwynplaine
the
mountebank
must
make
room
for
lord
clancharlie
if
the
peerage
was
accepted
and
he
had
made
his
decision
on
awakening
the
next
morning
he
thought
of
dea
then
came
a
royal
summons
to
appear
in
the
house
of
lords
and
gwynplaine
returned
to
london
in
a
carriage
provided
by
the
queen
the
secret
of
his
face
was
still
unknown
when
he
entered
the
house
of
lords
for
the
lord
chancellor
had
not
been
informed
of
the
nature
of
the
deformation
the
investiture
took
place
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
then
very
and
two
very
old
and
noblemen
acted
as
sponsors
at
the
lord
chancellor
request
the
whole
ceremony
was
enacted
in
a
sort
of
twilight
for
the
lord
chancellor
was
anxious
to
avoid
any
sensation
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
sitting
was
full
gossip
was
already
at
work
about
the
new
lord
clancharlie
several
peers
had
seen
the
laughing
man
and
they
now
heard
that
he
was
already
in
the
upper
house
but
no
one
noticed
him
until
he
rose
to
speak
his
face
was
terrible
and
the
whole
house
looked
with
horror
upon
him
what
does
all
this
mean
cried
the
earl
of
wharton
an
old
and
much
respected
peer
who
has
brought
this
man
into
the
house
who
are
you
where
do
you
come
from
gwynplaine
answered
i
come
from
the
depths
i
am
misery
my
lords
i
have
a
message
for
you
the
house
shuddered
but
listened
and
gwynplaine
continued
my
lords
among
you
i
am
called
lord
fermain
clancharlie
but
my
real
name
is
one
of
poverty
gwynplaine
i
have
grown
up
in
poverty
frozen
by
winter
and
made
wretched
by
hunger
yesterday
i
was
in
the
rags
of
a
clown
can
you
realise
what
misery
means
before
it
is
too
late
try
and
understand
that
our
system
of
society
is
a
false
one
but
the
house
rocked
with
uncontrollable
laughter
at
the
face
of
gwynplaine
in
vain
he
pleaded
with
those
who
sat
around
him
not
to
laugh
at
misery
they
refused
to
listen
and
the
sitting
broke
up
in
confusion
the
lord
chancellor
adjourning
the
house
gwynplaine
went
out
of
the
house
alone
night
and
the
ursus
waited
for
some
time
after
seeing
gwynplaine
disappear
within
southwark
gaol
then
he
returned
sadly
to
tadcaster
inn
that
very
night
the
corpse
of
hardquanonne
was
brought
out
from
the
gaol
and
buried
in
the
cemetery
hard
by
and
ursus
who
had
returned
to
the
prison
gate
watched
the
procession
and
saw
the
coffin
carried
to
the
grave
they
have
killed
him
gwynplaine
my
son
is
dead
cried
ursus
and
he
burst
into
tears
the
following
morning
the
sheriff
officer
accompanied
by
barkliphedro
waited
on
ursus
and
told
him
he
must
leave
southwark
and
leave
england
the
last
hope
in
the
soul
of
ursus
died
when
barkilphedro
said
gravely
that
gwynplaine
was
dead
ursus
bent
his
head
the
sentence
on
gwynplaine
had
been
executed
death
his
sentence
was
pronounced
exile
nothing
remained
for
ursus
but
to
obey
he
felt
as
if
in
a
dream
within
two
hours
ursus
homo
and
dea
were
on
board
a
dutch
vessel
which
was
shortly
to
leave
a
wharf
at
london
bridge
the
sheriff
ordered
the
tadcaster
inn
to
be
shut
up
gwynplaine
found
the
vessel
he
had
left
the
house
of
lords
in
despair
he
had
made
his
effort
and
the
result
was
derision
the
future
was
terrible
dea
was
his
wife
he
had
lost
her
and
he
would
be
spurned
by
josiana
he
had
lost
ursus
and
gained
nothing
but
insult
let
david
take
the
peerage
he
gwynplaine
would
return
to
the
green
box
why
had
he
ever
consented
to
be
lord
clancharlie
he
wandered
from
westminster
to
southwark
only
to
find
the
tadcaster
inn
shut
up
and
the
yard
empty
it
seemed
he
had
lost
ursus
and
dea
for
ever
he
turned
and
gazed
into
the
deep
waters
by
london
bridge
the
river
in
its
darkness
offered
a
resting
place
where
he
might
find
peace
he
got
ready
to
mount
the
masonry
and
spring
over
when
he
felt
a
tongue
licking
his
hands
he
turned
and
homo
was
behind
him
gwynplaine
uttered
a
cry
homo
wagged
his
tail
then
the
wolf
led
the
way
down
a
narrow
platform
to
the
wharf
and
gwynplaine
followed
him
on
the
vessel
alongside
the
wharf
was
the
old
wooden
tenement
very
and
rotten
now
in
which
ursus
lived
when
the
boy
first
came
to
him
at
weymouth
gwynplaine
listened
it
was
ursus

she
raised
herself
on
the
mattress
crying
in
delirium
he
is
no
longer
here

how
dark
it
is
gwynplaine

to
her
side
and

they
passed
chatham
and
the
mouth
of
the
medway
and
approached
the
sea
suddenly
dea

up
something

she
said
what
is
wrong

brought
life
to

flushed
then

very
pale
and
fell
they
lifted
her
up
and
dea
laid
her
head
on
gwynplaine
shoulder
then
with
a
sigh
of
inexpressible
sadness
she
said
i
know
what
this
is
i
am
dying
her
voice
grew
weaker
and
weaker
an
hour
ago
i
wanted
to
die

i
want
to
live
how
happy
we
have
been
you

remember
the
old
green
box

dearly

me
as
soon
as
you
can
do
not
leave
me
alone
long
oh
i
can
not
breathe
my
beloved
gwynplaine
pressed
his
mouth
to
her
beautiful
icy
hands
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
ceased
to
breathe
then
her
voice
rang
out
clearly
light
she
cried
i
can
see
with
that
dea
fell
back
stiff
and
motionless
on
the
mattress
dead
said
ursus
and
the
poor
old
philosopher
crushed
by
his
despair
bowed
his
head
and
buried
his
face
in
the
folds
of
the
gown
which
covered
dea
feet
he
lay
there
unconscious
gwynplaine
started
up
stretched
his
hands
on
high
and
said
i
come
he
strode
across
the
deck
towards
the
side
of
the
vessel
as
if
beckoned
by
a
vision
a
smile
came
upon
his
face
such
as
dea
had
just
worn
one
step
more
i
am
coming
dea
i
am
coming
he
said
there
was
no
bulwark
the
abyss
of
waters
was
before
him
he
strode
into
it
and
fell
the
night
was
dark
and
heavy
the
water
deep
he
disappeared
calmly
and
silently
none
saw
nor
heard
him
the

sailed
on

elizabeth

a
simple
story
the
maiden
name
of
inchbald
actress
novelist
dramatist
and
society
favourite
was
elizabeth
simpson
and
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
living
near
bury
edmunds
where
she
was
born
on
october
at
the
age
of
eighteen
she
ran
away
to
london
under
the
influence
of
romantic
expectations
which
were
realised
by
a
sudden
marriage
with
joseph
inchbald
the
actor
after
seventeen
years
on
the
stage
without
attaining
conspicuous
success
inchbald
retired
and
devoted
herself
to
the
writing
of
novels
and
plays
and
the
collection
of
theatrical
literature
her
first
novel
written
in
was
a
simple
story
with
nature
and
art
a
tale
written
later
it
has
kept
a
place
among
the
fiction
that
is
reprinted
for
successive
generations
in
later
years
inchbald
lived
quietly
on
her
savings
retaining
a
flattering
social
position
by
her
beauty
and
cleverness
she
died
on
august
the
priest
dorriforth
bred
at
omer
in
all
the
scholastic
rigour
of
that
college
was
by
education
and
the
solemn
vows
of
his
order
a
roman
catholic
priest
he
was
about
thirty
and
refusing
to
shelter
himself
from
the
temptations
of
the
layman
by
the
walls
of
a
cloister
but
finding
that
shelter
in
his
own
prudence
justice
fortitude
and
temperance
had
lived
in
london
near
five
years
when
a
gentleman
with
whom
he
had
contracted
a
most
sincere
friendship
died
and
left
him
the
sole
guardian
of
his
daughter
who
was
then
eighteen
it
is
in
this
place
proper
to
remark
that
milner
was
a
member
of
the
church
of
rome
but
his
daughter
had
been
educated
in
her
dead
religion
at
a
for
protestants
whence
she
had
returned
with
her
little
heart
employed
in
all
the
endless
pursuits
of
personal
accomplishments
and
her
mind
left
without
one
ornament
except
such
as
nature
gave
she
had
been
visiting
at
bath
when
her
father
died
therefore
dorriforth
together
with
miss
woodley
the
niece
of
the
widow
lady
horton
who
kept
his
house
journeyed
midway
to
meet
her
but
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
and
her
name
was
announced
he
turned
pale
something
like
a
foreboding
of
disaster
trembled
at
his
heart
and
miss
woodley
was
obliged
to
be
the
first
to
welcome
his
lovely
charge
lovely
beyond
description
but
the
natural
vivacity
the
gaiety
which
report
had
given
to
miss
milner
were
softened
by
her
recent
sorrow
to
a
meek
sadness
the
instant
dorriforth
was
introduced
to
her
as
her
guardian
and
her
deceased
father
most
beloved
friend
she
burst
into
tears
and
kneeling
before
him
promised
ever
to
obey
him
as
a
father
she
told
him
artlessly
she
had
expected
him
to
be
elderly
and
plain
he
was
somewhat
embarrassed
but
replied
that
she
should
find
him
a
plain
man
in
all
his
actions
and
in
the
conversation
which
followed
in
which
she
had
somewhat
lightly
referred
to
his
faith
begged
that
religion
should
not
be
named
between
them
for
as
he
had
resolved
never
to
persecute
her
in
pity
she
should
be
grateful
and
not
persecute
him
among
the
many
visitors
who
attended
her
levées
during
the
following
weeks
was
lord
frederick
lawnly
whose
intimacy
with
her
dorriforth
beheld
with
alternate
pain
and
pleasure
he
wished
to
see
his
charge
married
yet
he
trembled
for
her
happiness
under
the
care
of
a
young
nobleman
immersed
in
all
the
vices
of
the
town
his
uneasiness
made
him
desire
her
to
forbid
lord
frederick
visits
who
alarmed
confounded
and
provoked
remonstrated
passionately
by
heaven
i
believe
dorriforth
loves
you
himself
and
it
is
jealousy
which
makes
him
treat
me
in
this
way
for
shame
my
lord
cried
miss
woodley
trembling
with
horror
at
the
sacrilegious
idea
nay
shame
to
him
if
he
is
not
in
love
answered
his
lordship
for
who
but
a
savage
could
behold
beauty
like
yours
without
owning
its
power
and
surely
when
your
guardian
looks
at
you
his
wishes
are
never
less
pure
miss
milner
replied
eagerly
than
those
which
dwell
in
the
bosom
of
my
celestial
guardian
at
this
moment
dorriforth
entered
the
room
what
the
matter
cried
he
looking
with
concern
on
his
discomposure
a
compliment
paid
by
herself
to
you
sir
replied
lord
frederick
has
affected
your
ward
in
the
manner
you
have
seen
and
then
he
changed
the
subject
with
an
air
of
ridicule
while
miss
milner
threw
open
the
sash
and
leaned
her
head
from
the
window
to
conceal
the
embarrassment
his
implication
had
caused
her
although
dorriforth
was
a
good
man
there
was
an
obstinacy
in
his
nature
which
sometimes
degenerated
into
implacable
stubbornness
the
child
of
a
sister
once
beloved
who
married
a
young
officer
against
her
consent
was
left
an
orphan
destitute
of
all
support
but
from
his
uncle
generosity
but
although
dorriforth
maintained
him
he
would
never
see
him
miss
milner
brought
the
boy
to
town
once
to
present
him
to
his
uncle
but
no
sooner
did
he
hear
harry
rushbrook
name
than
he
set
him
off
his
knee
and
calling
for
his
hat
walked
instantly
from
the
house
although
dinner
had
just
been
served
about
this
time
miss
milner
had
the
humiliation
of
having
miss
fenton
held
up
to
her
as
a
pattern
for
her
to
follow
but
instead
of
being
inspired
to
emulation
she
was
provoked
to
envy
young
beautiful
elegant
miss
fenton
was
betrothed
to
lord
elmwood
cousin
and
dorriforth
whose
heart
was
not
formed
at
least
not
educated
for
love
beheld
in
her
the
most
perfect
model
for
her
sex
not
to
admire
miss
fenton
was
impossible
to
find
one
fault
with
her
was
equally
impossible
and
yet
to
love
her
was
unlikely
but
sandford
dorriforth
old
tutor
and
rigid
monitor
and
friend
adored
her
and
often
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
a
sigh
would
he
say
to
miss
milner
no
i
am
not
so
hard
upon
you
as
your
guardian
i
only
desire
you
to
love
miss
fenton
to
resemble
her
i
believe
is
above
your
ability
as
a
jesuit
he
was
a
man
of
learning
and
knew
the
hearts
of
women
as
well
as
those
of
men
he
saw
miss
milner
heart
at
the
first
view
of
her
person
and
beholding
in
that
little
circumference
a
weight
of
folly
that
he
wished
to
eradicate
he
began
to
toil
in
the
vineyard
eagerly
courting
her
detestation
of
him
in
the
hope
of
also
making
her
abominate
herself
in
the
mortification
of
slights
he
was
an
expert
and
humbled
her
in
her
own
opinion
more
than
a
thousand
sermons
would
have
done
she
would
have
been
cured
of
all
her
pride
had
she
not
possessed
a
degree
of
spirit
beyond
the
generality
of
her
sex
the
priest
marries
his
finding
dorriforth
frequently
perplexed
by
his
guardianship
sandford
advised
that
a
suitable
match
should
immediately
be
sought
for
her
but
she
refused
so
many
offers
that
believing
her
affections
were
set
upon
lord
frederick
he
insisted
that
she
should
be
taken
into
the
country
at
once
her
ready
compliance
delighted
dorriforth
and
for
six
weeks
all
around
was
the
picture
of
tranquillity
then
lord
frederick
suddenly
appeared
at
the
door
as
she
alighted
from
her
coach
and
seizing
her
hand
entreated
her
not
to
desert
him
in
compliance
with
the
injunctions
of
monkish
hypocrisy
dorriforth
heard
this
standing
silently
by
with
a
manly
scorn
upon
his
countenance
but
on
miss
milner
struggling
to
release
her
hand
which
lord
frederick
was
devouring
with
kisses
with
an
instantaneous
impulse
he
rushed
forward
and
struck
him
a
violent
blow
in
the
face
then
leading
her
to
her
own
chamber
covered
with
shame
and
confusion
for
what
he
had
done
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
and
earnestly
entreated
her
forgiveness
for
the
indelicacy
he
had
been
guilty
of
in
her
presence
to
see
her
guardian
at
her
feet
struck
her
with
a
sense
of
impropriety
as
if
she
had
seen
a
parent
there
all
agitation
and
emotion
she
implored
him
to
rise
and
with
a
thousand
protestations
declared
that
she
thought
the
rashness
of
his
action
was
the
highest
proof
of
his
regard
for
her
finding
that
lord
frederick
had
gone
when
he
had
resigned
the
care
of
his
ward
to
miss
woodley
dorriforth
returned
to
his
own
apartment
with
a
bosom
torn
by
excruciating
sensations
he
had
departed
from
his
sacred
character
and
the
dignity
of
his
profession
and
sentiments
he
had
treated
with
unpardonable
insult
a
young
nobleman
whose
only
offence
was
love
he
had
offended
and
filled
with
horror
a
beautiful
young
woman
whom
it
was
his
duty
to
protect
from
those
brutal
manners
to
which
he
himself
had
exposed
her
the
outcome
of
this
incident
was
a
duel
to
prevent
which
miss
milner
deceived
him
by
confessing
a
passion
for
lord
frederick
although
to
miss
woodley
she
avowed
the
real
truth
that
it
was
dorriforth
she
loved
do
you
suppose
i
love
lord
frederick
do
you
suppose
i
love
him
oh
fly
and
prevent
my
guardian
from
telling
him
this
untruth
this
duel
is
horrible
even
beyond
anything
else
oh
miss
woodley
pity
the
agonies
of
my
heart
my
heart
by
nature
sincere
when
such
are
the
fatal
propensities
it
cherishes
that
i
must
submit
to
the
grossest
falsehoods
rather
than
reveal
the
truth
are
you
so
blind
she
exclaimed
as
to
believe
i
do
not
care
for
dorriforth
oh
miss
woodley
i
love
him
with
all
the
passion
of
a
woman
and
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
wife
silence
cried
miss
woodley
struck
with
horror
yet
amidst
all
her
grief
and
abhorrence
pity
was
still
predominant
and
seeing
her
friend
misery
she
did
all
she
could
to
comfort
her
but
she
was
resolved
that
she
should
leave
home
and
on
pain
of
revealing
her
secret
to
dorriforth
induced
her
to
pay
a
visit
of
indefinite
length
to
her
friends
at
bath
there
in
the
melancholy
that
possessed
her
miss
woodley
letters
alone
gave
her
consolation
in
a
short
time
her
health
became
impaired
she
was
once
in
imminent
danger
and
during
her
delirium
incessantly
repeated
her
guardian
name
miss
woodley
journeyed
to
her
at
once
and
so
did
dorriforth
who
through
the
death
of
his
cousin
lord
elmwood
had
acquired
his
title
and
estates
on
this
account
he
had
received
a
dispensation
from
his
vow
of
celibacy
and
was
enjoined
to
marry
his
ward
felt
a
pleasure
so
exquisite
on
hearing
this
that
the
agitation
of
mind
and
person
brought
with
it
the
sensation
of
exquisite
pain
but
to
her
cruel
grief
she
found
that
he
was
on
the
advice
of
his
friends
already
paying
his
addresses
to
miss
fenton
as
if
a
poniard
had
thrust
her
to
the
heart
she
writhed
under
this
unexpected
stroke
she
felt
and
she
expressed
anguish
lord
elmwood
was
alarmed
and
shocked
but
later
when
in
his
perplexity
concerning
his
ward
marriage
he
induced
miss
woodley
to
tell
him
on
whom
miss
milner
choice
was
fixed
his
vehemence
filled
her
with
alarm
for
god
sake
take
care
what
you
are
doing
you
are
destroying
my
prospects
of
futurity
you
are
making
this
world
too
dear
to
me
i
am
transported
by
the
tidings
you
have
revealed
and
yet
perhaps
i
had
better
not
have
heard
them
he
exclaimed
and
then
to
prevent
further
question
he
hastened
out
of
the
room
within
a
few
days
he
was
her
professed
lover
she
the
happiest
of
human
beings
miss
woodley
partaking
in
the
joy
sandford
alone
lamented
with
the
deepest
concern
that
miss
fenton
had
been
supplanted
and
supplanted
by
miss
milner
yet
miss
fenton
was
perhaps
affected
least
of
any
by
the
change
she
received
everything
with
the
same
insipid
smile
of
approbation
and
the
same
cold
indifference
a
fatal
lost
in
the
maze
of
happiness
that
surrounded
her
miss
milner
oftentimes
asked
her
heart
are
not
my
charms
even
more
invincible
than
i
ever
believed
them
to
be
dorriforth
the
grave
the
pious
the
anchorite
dorriforth
by
their
force
is
animated
to
all
the
ardour
of
the
most
impassioned
lover
while
the
proud
priest
the
austere
guardian
is
humbled
if
i
but
frown
into
the
veriest
slave
of
love
she
then
asked
why
did
i
not
keep
him
longer
in
suspense
he
could
not
have
loved
me
more
i
believe
but
my
power
over
him
might
have
been
greater
still
i
am
the
happiest
of
women
in
the
affection
he
has
proved
to
me
but
i
wonder
if
it
would
exist
under
if
it
would
not
he
still
does
not
love
me
as
i
wish
to
be
loved
if
it
would
my
triumph
my
felicity
would
be
enhanced
thus
the
experiment
of
being
loved
in
spite
of
her
faults
a
glory
proud
women
ever
aspire
to
was
at
present
the
ambition
of
miss
milner
she
who
as
dorriforth
ward
had
ever
been
gentle
and
always
obedient
became
as
a
mistress
sometimes
haughty
always
insolent
he
was
surprised
but
the
novelty
pleased
him
miss
milner
whom
he
tenderly
loved
could
put
on
no
change
that
did
not
seem
to
become
her
but
at
last
her
attempt
to
rouse
his
jealousy
by
again
encouraging
lord
frederick
hurt
him
beyond
measure
in
a
letter
releasing
her
from
her
engagement
to
him
and
announcing
his
immediate
departure
for
a
long
continental
tour
he
begged
her
for
the
short
time
they
were
to
remain
together
not
to
insult
him
with
an
open
preference
for
another
by
complying
with
this
request
she
would
give
him
to
believe
that
she
thought
he
had
at
least
faithfully
discharged
some
part
of
his
duty
she
was
struck
to
despair
pride
alone
kept
her
from
revealing
her
anguish
though
her
death
should
be
the
immediate
consequence
but
sandford
who
had
hitherto
been
most
inimical
to
her
on
the
evening
before
lord
elmwood
departure
showed
at
last
some
kindness
by
entreating
her
to
breakfast
with
them
the
following
morning
there
she
sat
silent
unable
to
eat
unable
to
speak
unable
to
move
until
the
moment
for
parting
came
then
unable
to
repress
her
tears
as
heretofore
as
elmwood
took
her
hand
in
his
she
suffered
them
to
fall
in
torrents
what
is
all
this
cried
sandford
going
up
to
them
in
anger
they
neither
of
them
replied
or
changed
their
situation
separate
this
moment
cried
sandford
or
resolve
to
be
separated
only
by
death
lord
elmwood
do
you
love
this
woman
more
than
my
life
he
replied
with
the
most
heartfelt
accents
he
then
turned
to
miss
milner
can
you
say
the
same
by
him
she
spread
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
exclaimed
oh
heavens
i
believe
you
can
say
so
returned
sandford
and
in
the
name
of
god
and
your
own
happiness
since
this
is
the
state
of
you
both
let
me
put
it
out
of
your
power
to
part
on
which
he
opened
his
book
and
married
them
nevertheless
on
that
joyful
day
which
restored
her
lost
lover
to
her
hopes
again
even
on
that
very
day
after
the
ceremony
was
over
miss
milner
with
all
the
fears
the
superstition
of
her
sex
felt
an
excruciating
shock
when
looking
on
the
ring
lord
elmwood
had
put
upon
her
finger
in
haste
she
perceived
it
was
a
alas
in
seventeen
years
the
beautiful
beloved
miss
milner
was
no
longer
beautiful
no
longer
beloved
no
longer
virtuous
dorriforth
the
pious
the
good
the
tender
dorriforth
was
become
a
tyrant
miss
woodley
had
grown
old
but
less
with
years
than
grief
the
boy
harry
rushbrook
had
become
a
man
and
the
apparent
heir
of
lord
elmwood
fortune
while
his
own
daughter
his
only
child
by
his
miss
milner
he
refused
ever
to
see
again
in
vengeance
to
her
mother
crime
sandford
alone
remained
much
as
heretofore
lady
elmwood
was
a
loved
and
loving
bride
seventeen
years
ago
now
she
lay
on
her
at
her
course
was
run
after
four
years
of
perfect
happiness
lord
elmwood
was
obliged
to
leave
his
wife
and
child
while
he
went
to
visit
his
large
estates
in
the
west
indies
his
voyage
was
tedious
his
return
delayed
by
serious
illness
which
a
too
cautious
fear
of
her
uneasiness
prompted
him
to
conceal
he
was
away
three
years
it
was
no
other
than
lord
frederick
lawnly
to
whom
lady
elmwood
sacrificed
her
own
and
her
husband
future
peace
she
did
not
however
elope
with
her
paramour
but
escaped
to
shelter
herself
in
the
most
dreary
retreat
where
she
partook
of
no
comfort
but
the
still
unremitting
friendship
of
miss
woodley
even
her
child
she
left
behind
that
she
might
be
under
her
father
protection
conceive
then
how
sharp
her
agony
was
on
beholding
the
child
sent
after
her
as
the
perpetual
outcast
of
its
father
lord
elmwood
love
to
his
wife
had
been
extravagant
the
effect
of
his
hate
was
the
same
once
more
he
met
lord
frederick
in
a
duel
the
effect
of
which
was
to
leave
his
adversary
so
defaced
with
scars
as
never
again
to
endanger
the
honour
of
a
husband
he
was
himself
dangerously
wounded
yet
nothing
but
the
assurance
that
his
opponent
was
slain
could
tear
him
from
the
field
now
after
ten
years
of
exile
the
once
gay
volatile
miss
milner
lay
dying
with
but
one
request
to
make
that
her
daughter
should
not
suffer
for
her
sin
sandford
was
with
her
by
all
the
influence
he
ever
had
over
lord
elmwood
by
his
prayers
by
his
tears
he
promised
to
implore
him
to
own
his
child
she
could
only
smile
her
thanks
but
she
was
sufficiently
sensible
of
his
words
to
make
a
sign
as
if
she
wished
to
embrace
him
but
finding
life
leaving
her
fast
with
a
struggle
she
clung
to
her
child
and
died
in
her
arms
his
daughter
yet
all
that
her
mother
last
appeal
could
obtain
for
the
hapless
matilda
not
as
her
child
but
as
the
granddaughter
of
milner
was
the
shelter
of
her
father
roof
on
condition
that
she
avoided
his
sight
when
by
accident
or
design
he
ever
saw
or
heard
from
her
that
moment
his
compliance
with
her
mother
request
ceased
and
he
abandoned
her
once
more
still
the
joy
of
being
even
in
so
remote
a
way
under
her
father
care
was
extreme
for
her
though
it
was
tempered
with
jealousy
of
rushbrook
a
feeling
which
even
her
noble
heart
could
not
completely
quell
jealousy
which
was
shared
on
her
account
by
both
miss
woodley
and
sandford
and
frequently
made
them
unjust
to
harry
whom
they
regarded
as
an
interloper
but
his
passionate
gratitude
to
lady
elmwood
by
whose
entreaties
he
had
been
restored
to
his
uncle
favour
had
made
him
adore
her
daughter
with
an
equal
passion
he
gazed
with
wonder
at
his
uncle
insensibility
to
his
own
happiness
and
would
gladly
have
led
him
to
the
jewel
he
cast
away
though
even
his
own
expulsion
should
be
the
fatal
consequence
at
last
by
accident
lord
elmwood
returned
unexpectedly
home
when
matilda
was
descending
the
staircase
and
in
her
affright
she
fell
motionless
into
her
father
arms
he
caught
her
as
by
the
same
impulse
he
would
have
caught
anyone
falling
for
want
of
aid
yet
when
he
found
her
in
his
arms
he
still
held
her
there
gazed
on
her
attentively
and
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
at
length
trying
to
escape
the
snare
into
which
he
had
been
led
he
was
going
to
leave
her
on
the
spot
where
she
fell
when
her
eyes
opened
and
she
uttered
save
me
her
voice
unmanned
him
his
tears
now
burst
forth
and
seeing
her
relapsing
into
the
swoon
he
called
out
eagerly
to
recall
her
her
name
did
not
however
come
to
his
recollection
nor
any
name
but
this
miss
milner
dear
miss
milner
the
sound
did
not
awaken
her
and
now
again
he
wished
to
leave
her
in
this
senseless
state
that
not
remembering
what
had
passed
she
might
escape
the
punishment
but
at
this
instant
his
steward
passed
and
into
his
hands
he
delivered
his
apparently
dead
child
his
face
agitated
with
shame
with
pity
with
anger
with
paternal
tenderness
on
her
recovery
she
was
sent
to
a
neighbouring
farm
not
more
than
thirty
miles
away
her
father
having
given
orders
that
it
should
be
so
then
a
libertine
lover
of
lady
matilda
finding
her
no
longer
under
her
father
protection
resolved
to
abduct
her
and
by
raising
an
alarm
of
fire
caused
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
farmhouse
to
open
the
doors
when
two
men
rushed
in
and
with
the
plea
of
saving
her
from
the
flames
carried
her
away
news
of
this
being
taken
to
her
father
he
at
once
set
out
in
pursuit
and
reached
her
in
her
last
agony
of
despair
folding
her
in
his
arms
with
the
unrestrained
fondness
of
a
parent
it
was
now
the
middle
of
november
and
yet
as
matilda
passed
along
never
to
her
did
the
sun
shine
so
bright
as
upon
this
morning
never
did
her
imagination
comprehend
that
the
human
heart
could
feel
happiness
true
and
genuine
as
hers
rushbrook
had
been
detained
at
elmwood
during
all
this
time
more
from
the
persuasions
nay
prayers
of
sandford
than
the
commands
of
lord
elmwood
his
uncle
summons
for
him
to
join
them
in
town
was
therefore
received
with
delight
yet
his
joy
was
tempered
by
finding
that
it
was
to
propose
a
matrimonial
alliance
that
his
uncle
had
sent
for
him
after
a
thousand
fears
much
confusion
and
embarrassment
he
at
length
frankly
confessed
his
heart
was
engaged
and
had
been
so
long
before
his
uncle
offered
to
direct
his
choice
on
hearing
on
whom
he
had
set
his
affections
lord
elmwood
immediately
left
the
room
for
the
apartment
where
sandford
miss
woodley
and
matilda
were
sitting
and
cried
with
an
angry
voice
and
with
his
countenance
disordered
rushbrook
has
offended
me
beyond
pardon
go
sandford
and
tell
him
this
instant
to
quit
my
house
and
never
dare
to
return
but
matilda
impeded
him
and
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
cried
dear
sandford
do
not
how
exclaimed
her
father
she
saw
the
impending
frown
and
knelt
at
his
feet
do
you
know
what
he
has
asked
of
me
he
asked
no
she
replied
with
the
utmost
innocence
but
whatever
it
is
my
lord
though
you
do
not
grant
it
yet
pardon
him
for
asking
perhaps
you
would
grant
him
what
he
has
requested
said
her
father
most
willingly
were
it
in
my
gift
it
is
replied
he
go
to
him
in
the
library
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
for
on
your
will
his
fate
shall
depend
like
lightning
she
flew
out
of
the
room
while
even
the
grave
sandford
smiled
at
the
idea
of
their
meeting
and
whether
the
heart
of
matilda
could
sentence
rushbrook
to
misery
the
reader
is
left
to
surmise
and
if
he
supposes
that
it
could
he
has
every
reason
to
suppose
that
their
wedded
life
was
a
life
of
happiness
james
henry
masterton
the
son
of
a
physician
george
payne
rainsford
james
was
born
in
london
on
august
he
began
to
write
early
and
according
to
his
own
account
the
volume
of
short
stories
published
under
the
title
of
a
string
of
pearls
was
written
before
he
was
seventeen
as
a
contributor
to
the
magazines
and
newspapers
his
name
came
under
the
notice
of
washington
irving
who
encouraged
him
to
produce
in
his
life
of
edward
the
black
prince
richelieu
his
first
novel
brought
him
warm
praises
from
sir
walter
scott
and
thus
fortified
james
who
had
had
ambitions
for
a
political
life
determined
to
continue
his
career
as
a
novelist
his
output
of
fiction
was
amazing
he
was
the
author
of
upwards
of
a
hundred
novels
of
all
his
works
perhaps
his
most
characteristic
is
henry
masterton
which
appeared
in
more
solid
and
less
melodramatic
than
his
other
stories
it
abounds
in
picturesque
scenes
and
has
that
pleasant
spice
of
adventure
that
makes
for
good
romance
he
died
on
june
when
charles
the
first
was
in
the
earlier
years
of
the
reign
of
king
charles
when
already
there
were
signs
of
those
disorders
which
were
the
prelude
to
the
great
rebellion
one
of
the
most
prominent
gentlemen
at
his
majesty
court
was
a
certain
lord
langleigh
bold
and
rash
in
the
extreme
lord
langleigh
though
no
man
could
doubt
his
devotion
to
his
majesty
fell
under
the
suspicion
of
the
king
councillors
these
suspicions
were
given
a
form
and
direction
by
lord
ashkirk
an
impoverished
nobleman
who
secretly
lodged
certain
charges
of
treason
against
lord
langleigh
and
obtained
as
the
price
of
this
betrayal
the
wealth
and
the
estate
of
that
had
belonged
to
his
victim
tried
by
his
peers
and
found
guilty
on
false
evidence
lord
langleigh
awaited
his
death
upon
the
scaffold
in
the
of
the
tower
while
expecting
his
fate
he
sent
for
his
great
friend
lord
masterton
of
masterton
house
devonshire
to
settle
with
him
such
details
as
were
necessary
for
the
future
welfare
of
his
motherless
daughter
lord
masterton
immediately
hastened
to
london
and
exerted
all
his
influence
in
an
endeavour
to
secure
a
pardon
for
his
friend
but
his
efforts
were
in
vain
at
a
last
interview
he
promised
to
undertake
the
charge
of
lord
landleigh
infant
daughter
emily
and
voluntarily
pledged
himself
to
see
her
married
to
his
eldest
son
then
on
the
morning
of
the
execution
langleigh
contrived
to
escape
from
the
tower
in
the
company
of
the
captain
of
the
tower
guard
he
reached
a
ship
bound
for
the
continent
the
vessel
was
beset
by
a
storm
and
the
only
one
of
its
occupants
that
was
able
to
tell
the
tale
of
the
terrible
disaster
was
the
captain
of
the
guard
who
after
exonerating
everyone
from
a
share
in
his
prisoner
escape
died
from
exhaustion
meanwhile
lord
ashkirk
had
secured
the
price
of
his
treason
and
was
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
estates
of
not
even
certain
domestic
troubles
that
occurred
regarding
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
lady
eleanor
disturbed
the
serenity
of
his
content
before
his
accession
to
the
property
of
lord
langleigh
lord
ashkirk
had
betrothed
his
daughter
to
his
nephew
walter
dixon
the
son
of
a
wealthy
attorney
who
had
married
the
peer
sister
the
arrival
of
two
popish
gentlemen
sir
andrew
fleming
and
du
tillet
caused
him
to
alter
his
decision
sir
andrew
fell
in
love
with
the
wonderful
beauty
of
lady
eleanor
and
easily
persuaded
lord
ashkirk
himself
a
cavalier
and
a
papist
to
cancel
the
marriage
with
walter
dixon
who
had
joined
the
parliamentary
party
lady
eleanor
was
duly
united
to
sir
andrew
and
walter
dixon
deprived
of
his
bride
and
the
succession
to
the
estate
determined
to
be
revenged
he
found
a
means
ready
to
his
hand
lady
eleanor
pretended
no
affection
for
her
husband
and
took
a
special
delight
in
exciting
his
angry
jealousy
she
accepted
du
tillet
as
a
lover
and
when
dixon
wounded
in
a
duel
with
her
husband
was
carried
into
the
house
she
nursed
him
with
so
much
apparent
affection
and
attention
that
her
husband
wrath
passed
all
bounds
a
separation
became
necessary
and
sir
andrew
fleming
consented
to
leave
the
woman
whose
love
he
could
not
win
walter
dixon
so
far
satisfied
was
yet
determined
to
exact
his
full
tale
of
vengeance
and
secure
the
rich
lands
and
estates
of
the
death
of
lord
ashkirk
and
the
successful
growth
of
the
parliamentary
party
appeared
to
give
him
the
opportunity
he
so
eagerly
desired
a
web
of
at
masterton
house
in
devonshire
lord
masterton
remained
in
retirement
though
the
parliamentary
party
carried
all
before
them
he
would
doubtless
have
continued
to
refrain
from
drawing
his
sword
on
behalf
of
his
king
who
had
wronged
and
insulted
him
had
not
circumstances
forced
his
hand
his
tenantry
were
secretly
armed
and
drilled
and
under
the
command
of
frank
were
marched
eastwards
to
kent
to
join
lord
norwich
and
hales
who
were
preparing
a
rising
to
rescue
the
king
frank
before
leaving
masterton
house
bade
farewell
to
lady
emily
with
that
cold
reserve
and
studied
formality
which
was
part
of
his
character
the
fact
that
she
was
betrothed
to
him
by
the
commands
of
his
father
had
failed
to
arose
any
passion
in
his
breast
he
was
prepared
however
to
fulfil
the
commands
of
lord
masterton
though
his
heart
was
untouched
but
the
parting
between
his
brother
and
lady
emily
was
of
a
different
character
though
out
of
loyalty
to
his
brother
no
word
of
love
had
ever
passed
his
lips
henry
was
passionately
devoted
to
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
grown
up
with
him
under
his
father
roof
and
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
which
of
the
brothers
it
was
to
whom
lady
emily
had
given
her
affections
the
arrival
of
the
little
force
in
kent
brought
the
two
brothers
into
the
web
of
intrigue
which
was
being
spun
by
walter
dixon
it
was
object
to
prevent
the
union
of
frank
forces
with
lord
norwich
he
had
been
promised
the
estates
of
should
he
succeed
in
his
object
and
prove
lady
eleanor
a
malignant
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
he
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
prisoner
by
henry
masterton
to
whom
he
declared
that
he
was
really
a
royalist
in
disguise
his
next
step
was
to
obtain
for
the
brothers
an
invitation
from
lady
eleanor
to
quarter
themselves
at
once
he
had
settled
them
there
he
obtained
through
frank
masterton
valet
a
puritanical
knave
called
gabriel
jones
complete
information
as
to
their
plans
which
he
was
thus
able
to
thwart
at
frank
came
under
the
spell
of
lady
eleanor
beauty
all
his
duties
were
forgotten
and
he
lingered
on
by
the
side
of
the
woman
he
loved
in
vain
henry
protested
against
his
dereliction
of
duty
frank
refused
to
move
and
it
was
not
until
his
brother
came
in
touch
with
lord
norwich
that
circumstances
compelled
him
to
act
lord
norwich
was
furious
at
frank
conduct
i
will
give
your
brother
one
chance
he
said
to
henry
if
he
refuses
that
chance
i
shall
supersede
him
and
name
you
to
the
command
here
is
the
commission
if
you
succeed
in
persuading
him
to
join
me
at

you
may

if
not
you
must
take
the
command
and
march
immediately
sadly
henry
returned
to
on
the
way
he
overheard
a
conversation
between
walter
dixon
and
gabriel
jones
which
made
it
clear
that
they
were
privy
to
a
plot
having
for
its
object
the
ruin
of
frank
masterton
he
at
once
placed
them
both
under
arrest
and
hastened
to
his
brother
side
frank
obstinately
determined
not
to
move
only
the
intervention
of
lady
eleanor
induced
him
to
promise
to
set
out
the
next
day
but
on
the
morrow
frank
had
an
affair
of
honour
with
a
mysterious
man
in
black
with
whom
he
had
quarrelled
the
night
before
henry
found
him
bleeding
from
two
severe
wounds
and
then
having
issued
instructions
for
him
to
be
removed
to
the
house
rejoined
his
regiment
and
at
once
gave
the
order
to
march
he
reached
lord
norwich
to
find
all
his
trouble
in
vain
disaster
had
dissolved
the
forces
of
the
cavaliers
and
lord
norwich
had
reluctantly
decided
to
abandon
the
attempt
and
disbanding
his
men
made
the
best
of
his
way
into
essex
in
the
excitement
of
these
events
walter
dixon
effected
his
escape
on
his
way
back
to
henry
learned
that
lady
husband
was
still
alive
he
at
once
used
this
information
to
induce
frank
to
leave
the
side
of
lady
eleanor
and
in
spite
of
his
wounds
to
accompany
him
back
to
devonshire
as
the
lovers
parted
henry
overheard
their
last
words
then
i
rely
on
you
said
frank
in
a
hasty
voice
you
will
not
surely
you
will
not
fail
me
by
all
i
hold
dear
on
earth
and
beyond
the
earth
she
replied
in
low
thrilling
tones
days
of
to
lord
masterton
frank
related
the
story
of
how
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
early
part
of
the
campaign
and
had
been
compelled
to
hand
over
the
command
of
his
regiment
to
his
brother
this
piece
of
fiction
set
all
awkward
questions
at
rest
and
the
old
lord
satisfied
that
his
son
and
heir
had
covered
himself
with
honour
hastened
to
arrange
for
his
nuptials
with
lady
emily
both
to
henry
and
to
the
girl
these
were
days
of
gloom
but
frank
on
the
other
hand
was
strangely
happy
and
content
his
passion
for
lady
eleanor
was
still
unabated
and
though
to
gratify
his
father
he
had
consented
to
marry
lady
emily
he
had
already
taken
such
steps
to
prevent
their
union
as
would
leave
his
share
in
the
matter
undiscovered
dixon
though
he
had
carried
out
his
part
of
the
bargain
had
been
disgusted
to
discover
that
the
council
of
state
on
some
specious
excuse
refused
to
grant
him
the
estates
of
the
day
of
the
wedding
arrived
by
some
secret
arrangement
with
the
officiating
clergyman
the
service
was
unduly
protracted
but
at
last
those
words
were
reached
which
if
uttered
would
make
frank
and
lady
emily
one
then
suddenly
armed
men
burst
into
the
chapel
and
reading
their
warrant
demanded
the
arrest
of
frank
masterton
as
a
malignant
lately
in
arms
in
kent
the
bridegroom
offered
no
resistance
but
it
was
different
with
lord
masterton
he
boldly
called
upon
the
guests
present
to
draw
their
swords
a
scuffle
took
place
suddenly
from
the
gallery
above
the
voice
of
gabriel
jones
gave
the
order
to
fire
a
volley
rang
out
and
lord
masterton
fell
dead
at
the
feet
of
his
son
in
the
confusion
henry
seized
lady
emily
and
shooting
down
gabriel
jones
escaped
through
a
secret
passage
into
the
grounds
there
he
lay
hidden
for
some
days
and
then
when
the
coast
was
clear
secured
a
passage
in
a
smuggling
ship
for
himself
and
lady
emily
and
her
aunt
lady
margaret
arrived
in
france
he
placed
the
ladies
in
a
convent
at
dinan
and
made
his
way
to
england
again
under
an
assumed
name
as
a
commercial
traveller
for
a
french
house
to
learn
the
fate
of
his
brother
arrived
in
london
he
obtained
some
news
of
his
brother
from
a
goldsmith
who
had
acted
as
the
family
banker
for
years
past
through
the
assistance
of
lady
eleanor
frank
masterton
had
been
set
at
liberty
and
had
taken
his
departure
in
the
company
of
that
lady
to
paris
thither
henry
determined
to
follow
them
before
setting
out
he
paid
a
business
call
at
a
merchant
house
where
he
found
a
man
of
distinguished
appearance
whom
he
discovered
to
be
general
ireton
hearing
that
henry
was
bound
for
france
ireton
asked
him
whether
he
would
deliver
a
letter
for
him
to
general
maur
it
was
a
most
important
communication
he
declared
insomuch
as
it
was
the
payment
of
a
debt
to
a
man
to
whom
he
owed
much
warned
by
a
footstep
on
the
stairs
ireton
requested
henry
to
retire
into
the
adjoining
room
as
he
had
some
business
to
transact
through
the
door
henry
heard
the
voice
of
general
dixon
he
was
complaining
bitterly
that
ireton
had
not
carried
out
his
promise
and
handed
him
over
the
estates
of
we
have
no
excuse
for
sequestrating
the
estates
replied
ireton
walter
dixon
was
furious
declared
that
he
had
been
made
a
tool
of
and
threatening
ireton
announced
his
intention
of
going
to
france
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
departure
henry
was
summoned
from
the
other
room
and
being
bidden
to
hold
his
tongue
if
he
had
heard
anything
was
informed
by
ireton
that
he
would
visit
him
that
night
with
the
package
he
had
requested
him
to
deliver
to
general
maur
some
hours
later
when
it
was
dark
henry
received
his
visitor
but
the
unexpected
arrival
of
the
goldsmith
who
addressed
henry
by
his
real
name
disclosed
his
identity
finding
however
that
he
intended
him
no
ill
ireton
questioned
him
closely
as
to
what
had
brought
him
to
london
to
see
whether
i
might
not
render
some
aid
to
my
brother
henry
replied
after
having
placed
the
lady
emily
in
safety
she
was
never
in
danger
replied
ireton
quietly
i
would
take
good
care
of
that
i
will
still
trust
you
with
my
commission
the
time
may
come
when
you
will
thank
me
for
so
doing
with
that
he
turned
and
left
the
room
the
mysterious
chance
ordained
it
that
henry
masterton
should
cross
the
channel
on
the
same
boat
which
was
carrying
general
dixon
to
france
the
latter
with
what
general
ireton
had
called
his
blunt
hypocrisy
frankly
related
to
henry
the
motives
that
had
influenced
him
in
the
part
that
he
had
played
arrived
at
calais
the
two
men
journeyed
some
part
of
the
way
together
and
before
they
separated
henry
discovered
something
of
the
real
character
of
his
companion
by
his
familiarity
with
certain
cavaliers
who
having
lost
all
right
to
the
title
of
gentlemen
in
their
own
country
eked
out
a
living
by
brigandage
in
france
after
they
had
separated
henry
lost
his
way
and
arriving
at
night
drenched
through
with
the
rain
at
a
certain
chateau
begged
its
hospitality
for
a
night
he
was
led
into
the
and
introduced
to
another
guest
who
was
there
a
benedictine
monk
that
night
while
henry
lay
in
bed
he
was
startled
to
see
the
monk
standing
by
his
side
he
had
come
he
said
to
ask
him
several
questions
in
particular
he
wished
to
know
whether
his
brother
frank
had
married
lady
emily
langleigh
when
henry
related
how
the
marriage
had
been
prevented
the
benedictine
suddenly
sprang
to
his
feet
in
a
fury
of
rage
when
calmer
he
asked
henry
whether
frank
had
come
to
france
alone
but
on
this
subject
the
young
man
preserved
a
discreet
silence
and
after
a
few
more
questions
which
proved
the
monk
extraordinary
familiarity
with
all
walter
dixon
intrigues
at
he
left
the
room
the
following
day
henry
bade
farewell
to
his
courteous
host
and
made
his
way
to
dinan
there
he
found
that
the
convent
in
which
he
had
left
the
two
ladies
had
been
burnt
down
and
he
learnt
that
a
strange
gentleman
had
called
before
this
disaster
and
had
taken
lady
emily
and
lady
margaret
away
bitterly
disappointed
henry
made
his
way
to
paris
where
he
found
the
city
in
the
throes
of
a
civil
war
becoming
unintentionally
mixed
up
in
a
petty
skirmish
between
the
court
party
and
the
frondes
he
was
badly
wounded
and
narrowly
escaped
hanging
as
an
enemy
of
the
frondeurs
meanwhile
frank
masterton
or
lord
masterton
as
he
now
was
was
living
what
he
had
fondly
imagined
would
be
the
ideal
life
with
the
girl
he
loved
but
already
he
found
it
an
illusion
his
loss
of
honour
his
consciousness
that
his
conduct
was
discreditable
plunged
him
into
bitter
fits
of
remorse
from
which
he
vainly
sought
relief
by
a
round
of
gaiety
lady
eleanor
saw
these
signs
with
terror
and
despair
though
she
had
accomplished
her
desire
her
life
was
unbearable
daily
she
grew
more
miserable
at
last
she
determined
to
end
her
earthly
sufferings
in
her
chamber
she
swallowed
the
fatal
dose
of
poison
with
which
against
such
a
day
she
had
provided
herself
as
she
lay
in
the
throes
of
death
it
chanced
that
henry
masterton
arrived
having
at
length
found
his
brother
place
of
residence
henry
at
once
did
everything
possible
to
save
lady
eleanor
life
but
seeing
that
the
dark
shadow
deepened
every
moment
he
hastened
to
fetch
a
priest
in
the
street
he
came
upon
the
benedictine
talking
to
walter
dixon
and
bidding
him
follow
led
him
to
the
bedside
of
lady
eleanor
and
left
him
alone
with
the
dying
woman
bending
over
her
the
monk
solemnly
asked
her
if
she
had
anything
on
her
mind
which
she
wished
to
confess
he
pressed
a
cup
to
her
lips
and
in
a
slow
gasping
voice
she
laid
bare
the
story
of
her
life
and
then
went
on
to
relate
her
feelings
at
her
first
meeting
with
frank
masterton
when
we
parted
and
i
thought
of
the
man
to
whom
i
was
bound
for
life
what
fearful
feelings
came
across
my
bosom
sir
andrew
fleming
my
husband
was
it
possible
i
called
to
remembrance
his
look
his
harshness
his
jealousy
and
oh
god
oh
god
how
i
did
hate
that
man
woman
woman
exclaimed
the
monk
rising
up
from
his
seat
and
casting
back
the
cowl
from
his
head
oh
god
oh
god
how
i
did
love
you
lady
eleanor
eyes
fixed
full
upon
his
face
before
her
stood
in
the
garb
of
a
benedictine
monk
sir
andrew
fleming
her
husband
for
a
second
she
looked
at
him
imploringly
then
with
fearful
strength
she
rose
from
her
recumbent
position
and
clasping
her
hands
as
if
in
the
act
of
prayer
sank
down
upon
her
knees
at
his
feet
a
low
moan
escaped
from
her
lips
she
fell
forward
on
the
ground
and
the
spirit
departed
for
ever
from
its
clay
the
monk
grasped
his
forehead
with
his
hand
gazing
at
her
with
mingled
feelings
of
love
anger
sorrow
and
despair
then
raising
the
body
in
his
arms
he
placed
it
on
the
couch
and
bending
over
it
three
times
printed
a
long
kiss
upon
the
pale
lips
then
with
his
right
hand
thrust
into
his
robe
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
outside
in
the
hall
there
came
towards
him
lord
masterton
general
dixon
and
henry
a
look
of
deadly
concentrated
hate
came
into
sir
andrew
fleming
eyes
for
a
moment
he
paused
then
drawing
a
dagger
from
his
bosom
he
flung
himself
on
lord
masterton
and
with
one
blow
stretched
him
dead
at
his
feet
villain
cried
walter
dixon
atrocious
villain
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
he
drew
his
sword
and
at
once
passed
it
through
the
body
of
the
assassin
to
walter
dixon
this
scene
of
carnage
which
he
had
planned
with
elaborate
care
seemed
to
ensure
his
long
delayed
possession
of
the
estates
lady
eleanor
was
dead
her
husband
sir
andrew
had
fallen
by
his
hand
and
there
were
no
lives
now
between
him
and
his
rightful
possession
of
the
property
but
once
more
he
was
doomed
to
disappointment
as
soon
as
he
had
an
opportunity
henry
sought
out
general
maur
and
handed
him
the
package
he
had
received
from
ireton
the
general
pressed
him
to
stay
to
dinner
and
while
the
meal
progressed
extracted
from
him
something
of
his
story
when
the
meal
was
nearly
over
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
a
dog
rushed
to
him
barking
joyously
it
was
his
own
dog
the
dog
he
had
brought
with
him
from
masterton
house
and
left
with
lady
emily
how
had
it
come
there
amazed
he
was
about
to
ask
for
an
explanation
when
lady
emily
herself
stood
before
him
in
another
moment
the
lovers
were
in
one
another
arms
henry
astonished
as
he
was
at
these
events
was
still
more
surprised
when
he
learnt
that
general
maur
was
really
lord
langleigh
the
father
of
emily
he
had
not
as
all
the
world
had
thought
been
drowned
in
his
escape
from
the
tower
in
the
wreck
he
had
succeeded
in
saving
not
only
his
own
life
but
the
life
of
a
young
man
named
ireton
ireton
had
never
forgotten
the
debt
and
now
in
the
package
which
henry
had
brought
over
from
england
had
endeavoured
to
repay
it
he
had
persuaded
the
council
that
the
estates
of
had
been
improperly
sequestrated
by
king
charles
and
should
be
returned
to
their
lawful
owner
lord
langleigh
and
the
letter
contained
a
decree
of
the
council
once
more
granting
him
his
lands
and
title
when
walter
dixon
heard
of
these
events
which
again
snatched
the
prize
for
which
he
had
attempted
so
much
from
his
lips
he
determined
on
yet
another
effort
to
achieve
his
object
bribing
two
men
to
assist
him
in
the
deed
he
lured
lord
langleigh
into
an
ambush
only
the
prompt
arrival
of
henry
masterton
prevented
the
success
of
this
foul
deed
and
it
was
dixon
himself
who
fell
a
victim
lord
langleigh
too
good
a
cavalier
courteously
refused
the
offers
of
the
council
of
state
and
remained
in
france
until
the
restoration
when
with
henry
now
lord
masterton
and
his
wife
lady
emily
he
returned
to
to
spend
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
his
native
land

prince
of
abyssinia
samuel

born
at
lichfield
in
staffordshire
on
september
and
died
in
london
december
in
volume
ix
of
the
world
greatest
books
appears
an
epitome
of
boswell
famous
life
of
johnson
the
history
of
rasselas
prince
of
abyssinia
was
written
by
johnson
in
order
to
meet
the
expenses
incurred
by
his
mother
illness
and
death
according
to
boswell
the
work
was
composed
in
the
evenings
of
one
week
and
the
sheets
sent
to
the
printers
exactly
as
they
left
his
hands
without
even
being
read
over
by
the
author
himself
it
was
published
during
the
early
part
of
johnson
receiving
for
it
the
sum
of
and
a
further
amount
of
when
it
came
to
a
second
edition
of
all
works
rasselas
was
apparently
the
most
popular
by
it
reached
its
fifth
edition
and
has
since
been
translated
into
many
languages
the
work
is
more
of
a
satire
on
optimism
and
on
human
life
in
general
than
a
novel
and
perhaps
is
little
more
than
a
ponderous
dissertation
on
johnson
favourite
theme
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
as
to
its
actual
merits
johnson
contemporaries
differed
widely
some
proclaiming
him
a
pompous
pedant
with
a
passion
for
words
of
six
syllables
and
more
others
delighting
in
those
passages
in
which
weighty
meaning
was
illustrated
with
splendour
and
vigour

happy
rasselas
was
the
fourth
son
of
the
mighty
emperor
in
whose
dominions
the

bounty
pours
down
the
streams
of
plenty
and

which
the
wisdom
or
policy
of
antiquity
had
designed
for
the
residence
of
the
princes
was
a
spacious
valley
in
the
kingdom
of
amhara
surrounded
on
every
side
by
mountains
of
which
the
summits
overhang
the
middle
part
the
only
passage
by
which
it
could
be
entered
was
a
cavern
that
passed
under
a
rock
of
which
it
had
long
been
disputed
whether
it
was
the
work
of
nature
or
of
human
industry
the
outlet
of
the
cavern
was
concealed
by
a
thick
wood
and
the
mouth
which
opened
into
the
valley
was
closed
with
gates
of
iron
forged
by
the
artificers
of
ancient
days
so
massive
that
no
man
without
the
help
of
engines
could
open
or
shut
them
from
the
mountains
on
every
side
rivulets
descended
that
filled
all
the
valley
with
verdure
and
fertility
and
formed
a
lake
in
the
middle
inhabited
by
fish
of
every
species
and
frequented
by
every
fowl
whom
nature
has
taught
to
dip
the
wing
in
water
the
valley
wide
and
fruitful
supplied
its
inhabitants
with
all
the
necessaries
of
life
and
all
delights
and
superfluities
were
added
at
the
annual
visit
which
the
emperor
paid
his
children
when
the
iron
gate
was
opened
to
the
sound
of
music
and
during
eight
days
every
one
that
resided
in
the
valley
was
required
to
propose
whatever
might
contribute
to
make
seclusion
pleasant
to
fill
up
the
vacancies
of
attention
and
to
lessen
the
tediousness
of
time
every
desire
was
immediately
gratified
such
was
the
appearance
of
security
and
delight
which
this
retirement
afforded
that
they
to
whom
it
was
new
always
desired
that
it
might
be
perpetual
and
as
those
on
whom
the
iron
gate
had
once
closed
were
never
suffered
to
return
the
effect
of
longer
experience
could
not
be
known
here
the
sons
and
daughters
of
abyssinia
lived
only
to
know
the
soft
vicissitudes
of
pleasure
and
repose
the
sages
who
instructed
them
told
them
of
nothing
but
the
miseries
of
public
life
and
described
all
beyond
the
mountains
as
regions
of
calamity
where
discord
was
always
raging
and
where
man
preyed
upon
man
these
methods
were
generally
successful
few
of
the
princes
had
ever
wished
to
enlarge
their
bounds
they
rose
in
the
morning
and
lay
down
at
night
pleased
with
each
other
and
with
themselves
all
but
rasselas
who
in
the
year
of
his
age
began
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
pastimes
and
assemblies
and
to
delight
in
solitary
walks
and
silent
meditation
his
attendants
observed
the
change
and
endeavoured
to
renew
his
love
of
pleasure
but
he
neglected
their
officiousness
and
repulsed
their
invitations
one
day
his
old
instructor
began
to
lament
the
change
which
had
been
lately
observed
in
him
and
to
inquire
why
he
so
often
retired
from
the
pleasures
of
the
palace
to
loneliness
and
silence
i
fly
from
pleasure
said
the
prince
because
pleasure
has
ceased
to
please
i
am
lonely
because
i
am
miserable
and
am
unwilling
to
cloud
with
my
presence
the
happiness
of
others
you
sir
said
the
sage
are
the
first
who
has
complained
of
misery
in
the
happy
valley
i
hope
to
convince
you
that
your
complaints
have
no
real
cause
look
round
and
tell
me
which
of
your
wants
is
without
supply
if
you
want
nothing
how
are
you
unhappy
that
i
want
nothing
said
the
prince
or
that
i
know
not
what
i
want
is
the
cause
of
my
complaint
if
i
had
only
known
a
want
i
should
have
a
certain
wish
and
that
wish
would
excite
endeavour
for
its
satisfaction
i
have
already
enjoyed
too
much
give
me
something
to
desire
sir
said
the
old
man
if
you
had
seen
the
miseries
of
the
world
you
would
know
how
to
value
your
present
state
now
said
the
prince
you
have
given
me
something
to
desire
i
shall
long
to
see
the
miseries
of
the
world
since
the
sight
of
them
is
necessary
to
happiness
the
escape
into
the
outer
the
stimulus
of
this
new
desire
the
desire
of
seeing
the
world
soon
had
its
effect
in
making
rasselas
no
longer
gloomy
and
unsociable
considering
himself
as
master
of
a
secret
stock
of
happiness
he
affected
to
be
busy
in
all
the
assemblies
and
schemes
of
diversion
because
he
supposed
the
frequency
of
his
presence
necessary
to
the
success
of
his
purposes
he
retired
gladly
to
privacy
because
in
picturing
to
himself
that
world
which
he
had
never
seen
he
had
now
a
subject
of
thought
thus
passed
twenty
months
of
his
life
he
busied
himself
so
intensely
in
visionary
bustle
that
he
forgot
his
real
solitude
but
one
day
the
consciousness
of
his
own
folly
and
inaction
pierced
him
deeply
he
compared
twenty
months
with
the
life
of
man
the
period
of
human
existence
said
he
may
be
reasonably
estimated
at
forty
years
of
which
i
have
mused
away
the
part
these
sorrowful
meditations
fastened
upon
his
mind
he
passed
four
months
in
resolving
to
lose
no
more
time
in
idle
resolves
then
awakening
to
more
vigorous
exertion
he
for
a
few
hours
regretted
his
regret
and
from
that
time
bent
his
whole
mind
upon
the
means
of
escaping
from
the
valley
of
happiness
he
now
found
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
effect
that
which
it
was
very
easy
to
suppose
effected
he
passed
week
after
week
in
clambering
the
mountains
but
found
all
the
summits
inaccessible
by
their
prominence
the
iron
gate
was
not
only
secured
with
all
the
power
of
art
but
was
always
watched
by
successive
sentinels
in
these
fruitless
researches
he
spent
ten
months
the
time
however
passed
cheerfully
away
for
he
met
a
thousand
amusements
which
beguiled
his
labour
and
diversified
his
thought
a
little
while
afterwards
he
began
to
cherish
hopes
of
escaping
from
the
valley
by
quite
a
different
way
among
the
artists
allowed
there
to
labour
for
the
accommodation
and
pleasure
of
its
inhabitants
was
a
man
eminent
for
his
knowledge
of
the
mechanic
powers
who
had
contrived
many
engines
both
of
use
and
recreation
he
interested
the
prince
in
a
project
of
flying
and
undertook
to
construct
a
pair
of
wings
in
which
he
would
himself
attempt
an
aerial
flight
but
alas
when
in
a
time
the
wings
were
ready
and
their
contriver
waved
them
and
leaped
from
the
little
promontory
on
which
he
had
taken
his
stand
he
merely
dropped
into
the
lake
his
wings
only
serving
to
sustain
him
in
the
water
the
prince
was
not
much
afflicted
by
this
disaster
and
he
soon
forgot
any
disappointment
he
had
felt
in
the
society
and
conversation
of
a
new
artist
a
poet
called
imlac
who
delighted
him
by
the
narrative
of
his
travels
and
dealings
with
men
in
various
parts
of
africa
and
asia
hast
thou
here
found
happiness
at
last
asked
rasselas
tell
me
without
reserve
art
thou
content
with
thy
condition
or
dost
thou
wish
to
be
again
wandering
and
inquiring
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
valley
celebrate
their
lot
and
at
the
annual
visit
of
the
emperor
invite
others
to
partake
of
their
felicity
is
this
felicity
genuine
or
feigned
great
prince
said
imlac
i
shall
speak
the
truth
i
know
not
one
of
all
your
attendants
who
does
not
lament
the
hour
when
he
entered
this
retreat
i
am
less
unhappy
than
the
rest
because
i
have
a
mind
replete
with
images
which
i
can
vary
and
combine
at
pleasure
the
rest
whose
minds
have
no
impression
but
the
present
moment
are
either
corroded
by
malignant
passions
or
sit
steeped
in
the
gloom
of
perpetual
vacancy
what
passions
can
infect
those
said
the
prince
who
have
no
rivals
we
are
in
a
place
where
impotence
precludes
malice
and
where
all
envy
is
repressed
by
community
of
enjoyments
there
may
be
community
of
material
possessions
said
imlac
but
there
can
never
be
community
of
love
or
of
esteem
it
must
happen
that
one
will
please
more
than
another
he
that
knows
himself
despised
will
always
be
envious
and
still
more
envious
and
malevolent
if
he
is
condemned
to
live
in
the
presence
of
those
who
despise
him
the
invitations
by
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
allure
others
to
a
state
which
they
feel
to
be
wretched
proceed
from
the
natural
malignity
of
hopeless
misery
i
look
with
pity
on
the
crowds
who
are
annually
soliciting
admission
to
captivity
and
wish
that
it
were
lawful
for
me
to
warn
them
of
their
danger
upon
this
hint
rasselas
opened
his
whole
heart
to
imlac
who
promising
to
assist
him
to
escape
proposed
the
plan
of
piercing
the
mountain
a
suitable
cavern
having
been
found
the
two
men
worked
arduously
at
their
task
and
within
a
few
days
had
accomplished
it
a
few
more
days
passed
and
rasselas
and
imlac
with
the
prince
sister
nekayah
had
gone
by
ship
to
suez
and
thence
to
cairo
the
search
for
the
prince
and
princess
who
carried
with
them
jewels
sufficient
to
make
them
rich
in
any
place
of
commerce
gradually
succeeded
in
mixing
in
the
society
of
the
city
and
for
some
time
the
former
who
had
been
wont
to
ponder
over
what
of
he
should
make
thought
choice
needless
because
all
appeared
to
him
really
happy
imlac
was
unwilling
to
crush
the
hope
of
inexperience
till
one
day
having
sat
awhile
silent
i
know
not
said
rasselas
what
can
be
the
reason
that
i
am
more
unhappy
than
any
of
my
friends
i
see
them
perpetually
and
unalterably
cheerful
but
feel
my
own
mind
restless
and
uneasy
i
am
unsatisfied
with
those
pleasures
which
i
seem
most
to
court
i
live
in
the
crowds
of
jollity
not
so
much
to
enjoy
company
as
to
shun
myself
and
am
only
loud
and
merry
to
conceal
my
sadness
every
man
said
imlac
may
by
examining
his
own
mind
guess
what
passes
in
the
minds
of
others
when
you
feel
that
your
own
gaiety
is
counterfeit
it
may
justly
lead
you
to
suspect
that
of
your
companions
not
to
be
sincere
envy
is
commonly
reciprocal
we
are
long
before
we
are
convinced
that
happiness
is
never
to
be
found
and
each
believes
it
to
be
possessed
by
others
to
keep
alive
the
hope
of
obtaining
it
for
himself
this
said
the
prince
may
be
true
of
others
since
it
is
true
of
me
yet
whatever
be
the
general
infelicity
of
man
one
condition
is
more
happy
than
another
and
wisdom
surely
directs
us
to
take
the
least
evil
in
the
of
very
few
said
the
poet
live
by
choice
every
man
is
placed
in
the
present
condition
by
causes
which
acted
without
his
foresight
and
with
which
he
did
not
always
willingly
and
therefore
you
will
rarely
meet
one
who
does
not
think
the
lot
of
his
neighbour
better
than
his
own
rasselas
resolved
however
to
continue
his
experiments
on
life
as
he
was
one
day
walking
in
the
street
he
saw
a
spacious
building
which
all
were
by
the
open
doors
invited
to
enter
he
found
it
a
hall
of
declamation
and
listened
to
a
sage
who
discoursed
with
great
energy
on
the
conquest
of
the
passions
and
displayed
the
happiness
of
those
who
had
obtained
this
important
victory
after
which
man
is
no
longer
the
slave
of
fear
nor
the
fool
of
hope
is
no
more
emaciated
by
envy
inflamed
by
anger
emasculated
by
tenderness
or
depressed
by
grief
receiving
permission
to
visit
this
philosopher
having
indeed
purchased
it
by
presenting
him
with
a
purse
of
gold
rasselas
returned
home
with
joy
to
imlac
i
have
found
said
he
a
man
who
from
the
unshaken
throne
of
rational
fortitude
looks
down
on
the
scenes
of
life
changing
beneath
him
i
will
learn
his
doctrines
and
imitate
his
life
be
not
too
hasty
said
imlac
to
trust
or
to
admire
the
teachers
of
morality
they
discourse
like
angels
but
they
live
like
men
imlac
caution
turned
out
to
be
wise
for
when
the
prince
paid
his
visit
a
few
days
afterwards
he
found
the
philosopher
weeping
over
the
death
of
his
only
daughter
and
refusing
to
be
comforted
by
any
of
the
consolations
that
truth
and
reason
could
afford
still
eager
upon
the
same
inquiry
and
resolving
to
discover
whether
that
felicity
which
public
life
could
not
afford
was
to
be
found
in
solitude
rasselas
determined
to
visit
a
hermit
who
lived
near
the
lowest
cataract
of
the
nile
and
filled
the
whole
country
with
the
fame
of
his
sanctity
imlac
and
the
princess
agreeing
to
accompany
him
on
the
third
day
they
reached
the
cell
of
the
holy
man
who
was
desired
to
give
his
direction
as
to
a
choice
of
life
he
will
most
certainly
remove
from
evil
said
the
prince
who
shall
devote
himself
to
that
solitude
which
you
have
recommended
by
your
example
i
have
no
desire
that
my
example
should
gain
any
imitators
replied
the
hermit
in
my
youth
i
professed
arms
and
was
raised
by
degrees
to
the
highest
military
rank
at
last
being
disgusted
by
the
preferments
of
a
younger
officer
i
resolved
to
close
my
life
in
peace
having
found
the
world
full
of
snares
discord
and
misery
for
some
time
after
my
retreat
i
rejoiced
like
a
sailor
at
his
entrance
into
the
harbour
when
the
pleasure
of
novelty
went
away
i
employed
my
hours
in
examining
the
plants
and
minerals
of
the
place
but
that
inquiry
is
now
grown
tasteless
and
irksome
and
i
have
been
for
some
time
unsettled
and
distracted
i
am
sometimes
ashamed
to
think
that
i
could
not
secure
myself
from
vice
but
by
retiring
from
the
exercise
of
virtue
and
begin
to
suspect
that
i
was
rather
impelled
by
resentment
than
led
by
devotion
into
solitude
i
have
been
long
comparing
the
evils
with
the
advantages
of
society
and
resolve
to
return
into
the
world
they
accompanied
him
back
to
the
city
on
which
as
he
approached
it
he
gazed
with
rapture
a
day
or
two
later
rasselas
was
relating
his
interview
with
the
hermit
at
an
assembly
of
learned
men
who
met
at
stated
intervals
to
compare
their
opinions
the
way
to
be
happy
said
one
of
them
is
to
live
according
to
nature
in
obedience
to
that
universal
and
unalterable
law
with
which
every
heart
is
originally
impressed
which
is
not
written
on
it
by
precept
but
engraven
by
design
not
instilled
by
education
but
infused
at
our
nativity
when
he
had
spoken
he
looked
round
him
with
a
placid
air
and
enjoyed
the
consciousness
of
his
own
beneficence
sir
said
the
prince
with
great
modesty
as
i
like
all
the
rest
of
mankind
am
desirous
of
felicity
my
closest
attention
has
been
fixed
upon
your
discourse
i
doubt
not
the
truth
of
a
position
which
so
learned
a
man
has
so
confidently
advanced
let
me
only
know
what
it
is
to
live
according
to
nature
when
i
find
young
men
so
humble
and
so
docile
said
the
philosopher
i
can
deny
them
no
information
which
my
studies
have
enabled
me
to
afford
to
live
according
to
nature
is
to
act
always
with
due
regard
to
the
fitness
arising
from
the
relations
and
qualities
of
causes
and
effects
to
concur
with
the
great
and
unchangeable
scheme
of
universal
felicity
to
with
the
general
disposition
and
tendency
of
the
present
system
of
things
the
prince
soon
found
that
this
was
a
sage
whom
he
should
understand
less
as
he
heard
him
longer
he
therefore
bowed
and
was
silent
and
the
philosopher
supposing
him
satisfied
departed
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
with
the
present
system
happiness
they
find
rasselas
returned
home
full
of
reflections
and
finding
that
imlac
seemed
to
discourage
a
continuance
of
the
search
began
discourse
more
freely
with
his
sister
who
had
yet
the
same
hope
with
himself
we
will
divide
the
task
between
us
said
she
you
shall
try
what
is
to
be
found
in
the
splendour
of
courts
and
i
will
range
the
shades
of
humbler
life
accordingly
the
prince
appeared
next
day
with
a
splendid
retinue
at
the
court
of
the
bassa
but
he
soon
found
that
the
lives
of
courtiers
are
a
continual
succession
of
plots
and
detections
stratagems
and
escapes
faction
and
treachery
many
of
those
who
surrounded
the
bassa
were
sent
only
to
watch
him
and
to
report
his
conduct
to
the
sultan
at
last
the
letters
of
revocation
arrived
the
bassa
was
carried
in
chains
to
constantinople
and
in
a
short
time
the
sultan
that
had
deposed
him
was
murdered
by
the
janissaries
the
princess
who
in
the
meantime
had
insinuated
herself
into
many
private
families
proved
equally
unsuccessful
in
her
inquiries
she
found
not
one
house
that
was
not
haunted
by
some
fury
that
destroyed
its
quiet
in
families
where
there
is
or
is
not
poverty
said
she
there
is
commonly
discord
the
love
of
parents
and
children
seldom
continues
beyond
the
years
of
infancy
in
a
short
time
the
children
become
rivals
to
their
parents
each
child
endeavours
to
appropriate
the
esteem
or
fondness
of
the
parents
and
the
parents
betray
each
other
to
their
children
the
opinions
of
children
and
parents
of
the
young
and
the
old
are
naturally
opposite
by
the
contrary
effects
of
hope
and
despondence
of
expectation
and
experience
age
looks
with
anger
on
the
temerity
of
youth
and
youth
with
contempt
on
the
scrupulosity
of
age
surely
said
the
prince
you
must
have
been
unfortunate
in
your
choice
of
acquaintance
i
am
unwilling
to
believe
that
the
most
tender
of
all
relations
is
thus
impeded
in
its
effects
by
natural
necessity
domestic
discord
answered
she
is
not
inevitably
necessary
but
it
is
not
easily
avoided
we
seldom
see
that
a
whole
family
is
virtuous
the
good
and
the
evil
can
not
well
agree
the
evil
can
yet
less
agree
with
one
another
and
even
the
virtuous
fall
sometimes
to
variance
when
their
virtues
are
of
different
kinds
as
for
those
who
live
single
i
never
found
that
their
prudence
ought
to
raise
envy
they
dream
away
their
time
without
friendship
and
without
fondness
and
are
driven
to
rid
themselves
of
the
day
for
which
they
have
no
use
by
childish
amusements
and
vicious
delights
they
act
as
beings
under
the
constant
sense
of
some
known
inferiority
that
fills
their
minds
with
rancour
and
their
tongues
with
censure
i
can
not
forbear
to
flatter
myself
said
rasselas
that
prudence
and
benevolence
will
make
marriage
happy
what
can
be
expected
but
disappointment
and
repentance
from
a
choice
made
in
the
immaturity
of
youth
in
the
ardour
of
desire
without
judgment
without
foresight
without
inquiry
after
conformity
of
opinions
similarity
of
manners
rectitude
of
judgment
or
purity
of
sentiment
from
these
early
marriages
proceed
the
rivalry
of
parents
and
children
the
son
is
eager
to
enjoy
the
world
before
the
father
is
willing
to
forsake
it
and
there
is
hardly
room
at
once
for
two
generations
the
daughter
begins
to
bloom
before
the
mother
can
be
content
to
fade
and
neither
can
forbear
to
wish
for
the
absence
of
the
other
surely
all
these
evils
may
be
avoided
by
that
deliberation
and
delay
which
prudence
prescribes
to
irrevocable
choice
and
yet
said
nekayah
i
have
been
told
that
late
marriages
are
not
eminently
happy
it
has
generally
been
determined
that
it
is
dangerous
for
a
man
and
woman
to
suspend
their
fate
upon
each
other
at
a
time
when
opinions
are
fixed
and
habits
are
established
when
friendships
have
been
contracted
on
both
sides
and
when
life
has
been
planned
into
method
at
this
point
imlac
entered
and
having
refused
to
talk
upon
the
subject
of
their
discourse
persuaded
them
to
visit
the
great
pyramid
i
consider
this
mighty
structure
said
he
as
they
reposed
in
one
of
its
chambers
as
a
monument
of
the
insufficiency
of
human
enjoyments
a
king
whose
power
is
unlimited
and
whose
treasures
surmount
all
real
and
imaginary
wants
is
compelled
to
solace
by
the
erection
of
a
pyramid
the
satiety
of
dominion
and
tastelessness
of
pleasures
and
to
amuse
the
tediousness
of
declining
life
by
seeing
thousands
labouring
without
end
and
one
stone
for
no
purpose
laid
upon
another
soon
afterwards
the
prince
told
imlac
that
he
intended
to
devote
himself
to
science
and
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
days
in
retirement
before
you
make
your
final
choice
answered
imlac
you
ought
to
examine
its
hazards
and
to
converse
with
some
of
those
who
are
grown
old
in
the
company
of
themselves
he
then
introduced
him
to
a
learned
astronomer
who
had
meditated
over
his
science
and
over
visionary
schemes
for
so
long
that
he
believed
that
he
possessed
the
regulation
of
the
weather
and
the
distribution
of
the
seasons
a
visit
made
subsequently
to
the
catacombs
tended
still
further
to
give
a
grave
and
sombre
direction
to
the
thoughts
of
the
party
how
gloomy
said
rasselas
would
be
these
mansions
of
the
dead
to
him
who
did
not
know
that
he
should
never
die
that
what
now
acts
shall
continue
its
agency
and
what
now
thinks
shall
think
on
forever
those
that
lie
here
stretched
before
us
the
wise
and
the
powerful
of
ancient
times
warn
us
to
remember
the
shortness
of
our
present
state
they
were
perhaps
snatched
away
while
they
were
busy
like
us
in
the
choice
of
life
to
me
said
the
princess
the
choice
of
life
is
become
less
important
i
hope
hereafter
to
think
only
on
the
choice
of
eternity
it
was
now
the
time
of
the
inundations
of
the
nile
and
the
searchers
for
happiness
were
of
necessity
confined
to
their
house
being
however
well
supplied
with
materials
for
talk
they
diverted
themselves
with
comparisons
of
the
different
forms
of
life
which
they
had
observed
and
with
various
schemes
of
happiness
which
each
of
them
had
formed
schemes
which
now
they
well
knew
would
never
be
carried
out
they
deliberated
with
imlac
what
was
to
be
done
and
finally
resolved
when
the
inundation
should
cease
to
return

trained
for

he
achieved
the
distinction
of
winning
his
first
case
the
drudgery
of
a

to
him
and
fired
by

takes
the
highest
place
its
reputation
has
long
since
spread
outside
the
boundaries
of
hungary
and
the
story
itself
a
rare
combination
of
descriptive
power
humour
and
pathos
has
exercised
no
small
influence
upon
european
fiction
of
the
romantic
order
how
ali
saved
his
a
pierced
through
from
base
to
summit
a
gorge
four
miles
in
length
walled
in
by
lofty
precipices
and
between
these
walls
flows
the
danube
in
its
rocky
bed
at
this
time
there
were
no
steamers
on
the
danube
but
a
vessel
called
the
barbara
approaches
drawn
against
the
stream
by
horses
the
fate
of
the
vessel
lies
in
the
hands
of
two
men
the
pilot
and
the
captain
the
name
of
the
captain
is
michael
timar
he
is
a
man
of
about
thirty
with
fair
hair
and
dreary
blue
eyes
at
the
door
of
the
ship
cabin
sits
a
man
of
fifty
smoking
a
turkish
chibouque
euthemio
trikaliss
is
the
name
under
which
he
is
registered
in
the
and
he
is
the
owner
of
the
cargo
the
ship
itself
belongs
to
a
merchant
of
komorn
called
athanas
brazovics
out
of
one
of
the
cabin
windows
looks
the
face
of
a
young
girl
timéa
the
daughter
of
euthemio
and
the
face
is
as
white
as
marble
timéa
and
her
father
are
the
only
passengers
of
the
barbara
when
the
captain
lays
aside
his
he
has
time
to
chat
with
timéa
who
understands
only
modern
greek
which
the
captain
speaks
fluently
it
is
always
a
dangerous
voyage
for
the
current
is
fierce
and
the
rocks
are
too
the
barbara
was
pursued
by
a
turkish
gunboat
but
the
vessel
makes
its
way
safely
in
spite
of
current
and
rocks
and
the
turkish
gunboat
gives
up
the
chase
three
days
later
the
barbara
has
reached
the
island
of
orsova
the
plains
of
hungary
are
to
the
north
of
the
river
servia
to
the
south
provisions
had
run
short
and
timar
decided
to
go
on
shore
there
were
no
signs
of
human
habitation
at
first
but
timar
sharp
eyes
had
discovered
a
faint
smoke
rising
above
the
tops
of
the
poplars
he
worked
his
way
in
a
small
skiff
through
the
reeds
reached
dry
land
pushed
through
hedges
and
bushes
and
then
stood
transfixed
with
admiration
a
cultivated
orchard
of
some
five
or
six
acres
was
before
him
and
beyond
that
a
full
of
summer
bloom
timar
went
up
through
the
orchard
and
flower
garden
to
a
cottage
built
partly
in
the
rock
and
covered
with
creepers
a
huge
black
newfoundland
dog
was
lying
before
the
door
a
woman
voice
answered
timar
and
the
dog
raised
no
objection
to
the
captain
going
indoors
it
never
hurts
good
people
said
the
woman
timar
explained
his
mission
the
wind
had
brought
his
vessel
to
a
standstill
he
was
short
of
provisions
and
he
had
two
passengers
who
would
be
grateful
for
shelter
on
land
for
the
night
the
woman
promised
him
food
and
a
room
for
his
passengers
in
exchange
for
grain
and
at
her
word
the
dog
brought
him
by
a
better
path
to
the
river
presently
timar
was
back
again
with
euthemio
and
timéa
and
now
a
young
girl
appeared
whom
the
housewife
called
noemi
before
supper
was
over
the
growling
of
the
dog
announced
a
new
arrival
and
a
man
of
youthful
appearance
who
introduced
himself
as
theodor
krisstyan
an
old
friend
of
the
lady
of
the
house
whom
he
called
madame
therese
entered
and
made
himself
quickly
at
home
it
was
plain
that
his
hostess
both
feared
and
disliked
theodor
while
timar
who
had
met
him
before
regarded
him
as
a
spy
in
the
pay
of
the
turkish
government
in
the
morning
the
wind
had
gone
down
theodor
had
vanished
and
timar
and
his
passengers
prepared
to
renew
their
journey
therese
told
timar
her
story
before
he
left
how
she
and
her
daughter
noemi
had
lived
there
for
twelve
years
and
who
the
objectionable
theodor
was
then
she
added
in
a
whisper
i
fancy
this
man
visit
was
either
on
your
account
or
that
of
the
other
gentleman
be
on
your
guard
if
either
of
you
dread
the
discovery
of
a
secret
trikaliss
looked
very
gloomy
when
he
heard
the
stranger
had
left
before
sunrise
and
the
following
night
he
called
timar
to
his
cabin
i
am
dying
he
said
i
want
to
die
i
have
taken
poison
timéa
will
not
wake
till
all
is
over
my
true
name
is
not
euthemio
trikaliss
but
ali
tschorbadschi
i
was
once
governor
of
candia
and
then
treasurer
in
stamboul
you
know
there
is
a
revolution
proceeding
in
turkey
my
turn
was
coming
not
that
i
was
a
conspirator
but
the
treasury
wanted
my
money
and
the
seraglio
my
daughter
death
is
easy
for
me
but
i
will
not
let
my
daughter
go
into
the
harem
nor
myself
be
made
a
beggar
therefore
i
hired
your
vessel
and
loaded
it
with
grain
the
owner
athanas
brazovics
is
a
connection
of
mine
i
have
often
shown
him
kindness
he
can
return
it
now
by
a
miracle
we
got
safely
through
the
rocks
and
whirlpools
of
the
river
and
eluded
the
pursuit
of
the
turkish
brigantine
and
now
i
stumble
over
a
straw
into
my
grave
that
man
who
followed
us
last
evening
was
a
spy
of
the
turkish
government
he
recognised
me
and
sealed
my
fate
the
government
would
not
demand
me
from
austria
as
a
political
refugee
but
as
a
thief
this
is
unjust
for
what
i
took
was
my
own
but
i
am
pursued
as
a
thief
and
austria
gives
up
escaped
thieves
if
turkish
spies
can
trace
them
by
dying
i
can
save
my
daughter
and
her
property
swear
to
me
by
your
faith
and
your
honour
you
will
carry
out
my
instructions
here
in
this
casket
is
about
a
thousand
ducats
take
timéa
to
athanas
brazovics
and
beg
him
to
adopt
my
daughter
give
him
the
money
he
must
spend
it
on
the
education
of
the
child
and
give
him
also
the
cargo
and
beg
him
to
be
present
when
the
sacks
are
emptied
you
understand
the
dying
man
looked
in
timar
face
and
struggled
for
breath
yes
the
red
crescent
he
stammered
the
red
crescent
then
the
closed
his
lips
one
struggle
and
he
was
a
corpse
timor
tempted
and
when
the
barbara
had
nearly
reached
komorn
it
struck
an
uprooted
tree
lying
in
ambush
under
water
and
immediately
began
to
sink
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
save
a
vessel
wrecked
in
this
way
the
crew
all
left
the
sinking
craft
and
timar
rescued
timéa
and
with
her
the
casket
with
the
thousand
ducats
then
the
captain
drove
off
with
the
fatherless
girl
to
the
house
of
athanas
brazovics
in
the
town
of
komorn
at
first
athanas
kissed
timéa
very
heartily
but
when
he
learnt
that
his
vessel
was
lost
and
all
timéa
property
except
the
thousand
ducats
and
the
wheat
sacks
now
spoilt
by
water
he
altered
his
tune
he
and
his
wife
sophie
decided
that
timéa
should
live
with
them
as
an
adopted
child
and
at
the
same
time
attend
on
their
daughter
athalie
as
a
athalie
and
her
mother
treated
the
poor
girl
with
scornful
contempt
as
for
timar
athanas
turned
on
him
savagely
as
though
the
captain
could
have
prevented
the
wreck
on
the
advice
of
his
friend
lieutenant
katschuka
who
was
betrothed
to
athalie
timar
purchased
the
sunken
grain
next
day
when
it
was
put
up
for
auction
buying
the
whole
cargo
for
gulden
you
will
do
the
poor
orphan
a
good
turn
if
you
buy
it
said
the
lieutenant
otherwise
the
value
of
the
cargo
will
all
go
in
salvage
timar
at
once
made
arrangements
for
hauling
up
the
sacks
and
for
the
immediate
drying
and
grinding
of
the
corn
and
all
day
labourers
were
at
work
on
the
wreck
at
nightfall
timar
left
alone
noticed
one
sack
differently
marked
from
the
rest
marked
with
a
red
crescent
within
this
was
a
long
leathern
bag
he
broke
it
open
and
found
it
full
of
diamonds
emeralds
and
sapphires
richly
set
in
girdles
and
bracelets
and
rings
a
whole
heap
of
unset
diamonds
were
in
an
agate
box
the
whole
treasure
was
worth
at
least
gulden
the
barbara
had
carried
a
million
on
board
to
whom
does
this
treasure
belong
timar
put
the
question
to
himself
and
answered
it
why
whom
should
it
belong
to
but
you
you
bought
the
sunken
cargo
just
as
it
is
with
the
sacks
and
the
grain
if
the
treasurer
stole
the
jewels
from
the
sultan
the
sultan
probably
stole
them
in
his
campaigns
and
timéa
timéa
would
not
know
how
to
use
the
treasure
and
her
adopted
father
would
absorb
it
and
get
rid
of
of
it
what
would
be
the
result
if
timéa
gets
it
she
would
be
a
rich
lady
and
would
not
cast
a
look
at
you
from
her
height
now
things
are
the
other
way
you
will
be
a
rich
man
and
she
a
poor
girl
you
do
not
want
the
treasure
for
yourself
you
will
invest
it
profitably
and
when
you
have
earned
with
the
first
million
a
second
and
a
third
you
will
go
to
the
poor
girl
and
say
take
it
it
is
all
yours
and
take
me
too
you
only
wish
to
become
rich
in
order
to
make
her
happy
the
moon
and
the
waves
cried
to
timar
you
are
rich
you
are
a
made
man
but
when
it
was
dark
an
inward
voice
whispered
you
are
a
thief
from
that
day
all
timar
undertakings
flourished
and
step
by
step
he
reached
the
summit
of
an
ordinary
successful
business
man
ambition
the
title
of
nobility
at
the
same
time
brazovics
who
had
treated
timar
with
brutal
inconsiderateness
because
of
the
wreck
of
the
barbara
went
steadily
borrowing
and
embezzling
trust
monies
in
his
fall
lieutenant
katschuka
had
declared
all
along
that
he
could
not
marry
athalie
without
a
dowry
and
when
the
wedding
day
arrived
brazovics
unable
to
face
his
creditors
and
knowing
himself
bankrupt
penniless
and
fraudulent
committed
suicide
katschuka
immediately
declared
the
engagement
at
an
end
in
his
heart
he
had
long
wearied
of
athalie
and
looked
with
desire
on
timéa
the
orphan
girl
from
the
first
had
loved
the
lieutenant
with
silent
unspoken
affection
when
the
brazovics
house
was
put
up
for
sale
timar
bought
it
outright
furniture
and
all
and
then
said
to
timéa
from
this
day
forth
you
are
the
mistress
of
this
house
everything
in
it
belongs
to
you
all
is
inscribed
in
your
name
accept
it
from
me
you
are
the
owner
of
the
house
and
if
there
is
a
little
shelter
for
me
in
your
heart
and
you
did
not
refuse
my
hand
then
i
should
be
only
too
happy
timéa
gave
her
hand
to
timar
and
said
in
a
low
firm
voice
i
accept
you
as
my
husband
and
will
be
a
faithful
and
obedient
wife
this
man
had
always
been
so
good
to
her
he
had
never
made
sport
of
her
nor
flattered
her
and
he
had
saved
her
life
on
the
danube
when
the
barbara
was
sinking
he
had
given
her
all
her
heart
could
desire
except
one
thing
and
that
belonged
to
another
the
ownerless
on
his
betrothal
to
timéa
a
great
burden
was
lifted
from
the
soul
of
timar
since
the
day
when
the
treasure
of
ali
tschorbadschi
had
enabled
him
to
achieve
power
and
riches
timar
had
been
haunted
by
the
voice
of
this
money
does
not
belong
to
you
it
was
the
property
of
an
orphan
you
are
a
man
of
gold
you
are
a
thief
but
now
the
defrauded
orphan
had
received
back
her
property
only
timar
forgot
that
he
had
demanded
in
exchange
the
girl
heart
timéa
promised
to
be
a
faithful
and
obedient
wife
but
on
the
day
when
timar
said
do
you
love
me
she
only
opened
wide
her
eyes
and
asked
what
is
love
timar
found
he
had
married
a
marble
statue
and
that
all
his
riches
would
not
buy
his
wife
love
he
became
wretched
conscious
that
his
wife
was
unhappy
that
he
was
the
author
of
their
mutual
misery
then
in
the
early
summer
timar
went
off
from
komorn
to
shoot
fowl
he
meant
to
go
to
the
ownerless
island
at
ostrova
it
was
three
years
since
that
former
visit
therese
and
noemi
welcomed
him
cordially
at
the
island
and
timar
forgot
his
troubles
when
he
was
with
them
therese
told
him
her
story
how
her
husband
ruined
by
the
father
of
theodor
krisstyan
and
by
athanas
brazovics
had
committed
suicide
and
how
forsaken
and
friendless
she
had
brought
her
child
to
this
island
which
neither
austria
nor
turkey
claimed
and
where
no
called
with
her
own
hands
she
had
turned
the
wilderness
into
a
paradise
and
the
only
fear
she
had
was
that
theodor
krisstyan
who
had
discovered
her
retreat
might
reveal
it
to
the
turkish
government
therese
had
no
money
and
no
use
for
it
but
she
exchanged
fruit
and
honey
for
grain
salt
clothes
and
hardware
and
the
people
with
whom
she
bartered
were
not
inclined
to
gossip
about
her
affairs
so
no
news
concerning
the
island
ever
went
to
vienna
komorn
or
constantinople
and
the
fact
of
timar
great
prosperity
had
not
reached
the
islanders
he
was
welcomed
as
a
man
and
therese
did
not
know
that
timar
had
been
powerful
enough
to
get
a
ninety
lease
of
the
island
from
both
turkish
and
austrian
governments
perhaps
no
very
difficult
matter
as
the
existence
of
the
island
was
unknown
and
there
were
fees
to
be
paid
over
the
concession
when
he
told
her
what
he
had
done
noemi
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
theodor
krisstyan
was
furious
but
timar
procured
him
a
post
in
brazil
and
for
a
long
time
the
disreputable
spy
was
too
far
off
to
be
troublesome
and
now
on
this
island
timar
found
health
and
rest
it
became
his
home
and
for
the
summer
months
every
year
he
would
slip
away
from
komorn
and
no
one
not
even
timéa
guessed
his
secret
when
he
returned
cold
white
face
was
still
an
unsolved
riddle
to
her
husband
she
would
greet
him
kindly
but
never
was
there
any
token
that
she
loved
him
timar
business
operations
were
excuse
for
his
long
absences
but
all
the
same
the
double
life
he
was
leading
made
him
ill
he
could
not
tell
timéa
of
therese
and
noemi
and
he
could
not
tell
them
on
the
island
that
he
was
married
timéa
on
her
side
devoted
herself
more
and
more
to
her
business
in
his
absence
and
when
major
katschuka
once
called
and
asked
her
if
she
could
not
arrange
for
a
divorce
she
answered
gently
my
husband
is
the
noblest
man
in
the
world
should
i
separate
from
him
who
has
no
one
but
me
to
love
him
am
i
to
tell
him
that
i
hate
him
i
who
owe
everything
to
him
and
who
brought
him
no
dowry
but
a
loveless
heart
timar
learnt
from
athalie
who
lived
in
timéa
house
of
this
reply
and
felt
more
in
despair
than
ever
he
wanted
timéa
to
be
happy
she
had
never
been
his
wife
except
in
name
for
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
love
and
he
wanted
to
go
away
and
leave
all
his
riches
behind
and
settle
on
the
island
now
more
than
ever
was
he
wanted
on
the
island
for
therese
had
died
of
heart
failure
and
the
years
had
made
noemi
a
woman
my
name
is
nobody
it
was
winter
and
timar
had
gone
off
alone
to
a
house
that
belonged
to
him
near
a
frozen
lake
he
felt
the
time
had
come
for
flight
but
whither
theodor
krisstyan
had
turned
up
again
in
brazil
he
had
heard
a
story
of
ali
tschorbadschi
jewels
from
an
old
criminal
from
turkey
and
he
had
returned
to
blackmail
timar
but
he
did
not
find
him
till
timar
was
at
the
frozen
lake
krisstyan
story
was
not
true
timar
knew
that
the
accusations
were
false
as
he
listened
to
the
vagabond
indictment
he
had
not
killed
timéa
father
nor
stolen
his
treasure
but
he
had
played
a
false
game
and
his
position
was
a
false
one
krisstyan
demanded
a
change
of
raiment
and
timar
let
him
take
clothes
and
shirts
but
at
last
the
blackmailer
demands
became
too
insolent
and
timar
drove
him
out
of
the
house
and
now
it
seemed
to
timar
that
his
own
career
was
finished
this
ruffian
krisstyan
could
expose
the
foundation
of
his
wealth
and
how
could
he
live
discredited
before
the
world
on
the
frozen
water
there
were
great
fissures
between
the
blocks
of
ice
within
the
waves
of
the
lake
death
would
come
quickly
timar
walked
out
on
the
ice
and
there
before
him
the
head
of
theodor
krisstyan
rose
in
the
water
and
then
sank
the
spy
had
not
known
the
treachery
of
the
fissures
timar
fled
to
the
ownerless
island
and
when
the
corpse
of
krisstyan
was
discovered
in
an
advanced
stage
of
decomposition
timéa
declared
she
recognized
her
husband
clothes
so
the
body
of
theodor
krisstyan
was
buried
with
great
pomp
and
a
year
later
timéa
married
major
katschuka
and
then
haunted
by
the
doubt
whether
her
first
husband
was
really
dead
pined
away
no
blessing
rested
on
the
wealth
timar
left
behind
him
the
only
son
timéa
bore
to
the
major
was
a
great
spendthrift
and
in
his
hands
the
fabulous
wealth
vanished
as
quickly
as
it
had
grown
and
what
is
passing
meanwhile
on
the
ownerless
island
forty
years
have
passed
since
timar
disappearance
from
komorn
and
the
island
is
now
a
complete
model
farm
recently
a
friend
of
mine
an
ardent
naturalist
took
me
to
the
island
i
had
heard
as
a
child
of
timar
and
his
wealth
every
inch
of
ground
is
utilised
or
serves
to
beautify
the
place
the
tobacco
grown
here
has
the
most
exquisite
aroma
and
the
beehives
look
from
a
distance
like
a
small
town
with
roofs
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
owner
of
the
island
understands
luxury
and
yet
that
owner
never
has
a
farthing
to
call
his
own
no
money
ever
enters
the
island
those
however
who
need
the
exports
know
also
the
requirements
of
the
islanders
and
bring
them
for
barter
the
whole
colony
consisted
of
one
family
and
each
was
called
only
by
his
christian
name
the
six
sons
of
the
first
settler
had
married
women
of
the
district
and
the
numbers
of
grandchildren
and
already
exceeded
forty
but
the
island
maintained
them
all
poverty
was
unknown
they
lived
in
luxury
each
knew
some
trade
and
if
they
had
been
ten
times
as
many
their
labour
would
have
supported
them
when
we
arrived
on
the
island
the
nominal
head
of
the
family
a
man
of
forty
received
us
cordially
and
in
the
evening
presented
us
to
his
parents
when
my
name
was
mentioned
to
the
old
man
he
looked
long
at
me
and
a
visible
colour
rose
in
his
cheeks
i
began
to
tell
him
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
that
hungary
was
now
united
to
austria
and
that
the
taxes
were
very
heavy
he
blew
a
cloud
from
his
pipe
and
the
smoke
said
my
island
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
we
have
no
taxes
here
i
told
him
of
wars
financial
panics
the
strife
of
religion
and
politics
and
the
smoke
seemed
to
say
we
wage
war
with
no
one
here
thank
god
we
have
no
money
here
and
no
elections
or
ministers
presently
the
old
man
asked
me
where
i
was
born
and
what
my
profession
was
and
when
i
told
him
that
i
wrote
romances
he
said
guess
my
story
there
was
once
a
man
who
left
a
world
in
which
he
was
admired
and
respected
and
created
a
second
world
in
which
he
was
loved
may
i
venture
to
ask
your
name
i
said
the
old
man
seemed
to
grow
a
head
taller
then
raising
his
trembling
hands
he
laid
them
on
my
head
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
once
long
long
before
those
same
hands
had
rested
on
my
head
when
childish
curls
covered
it
and
that
i
had
seen
that
noble
face
before
my
name
is
nobody
he
replied
to
my
question
and
after
that
night
i
saw
him
no
more
during
our
stay
on
the
island
the
privileges
granted
by
two
governments
to
the
owner
of
the
island
will
last
for
fifty
years
more
and
who
knows
what
may
happen
to
the
world
in
fifty
years

through

the
ghost
of
the
some
years
ago
i
became
so
seriously
ill
that
i
was
pronounced
dying
and
finally
dead
dead
to
all
intents
and
purposes
i
remained
for
two
days
when
to
the
astonishment
of
the
physicians
i
exhibited
symptoms
of
returning
vitality
and
in
a
week
was
convalescent
of
the
moments
preceding
my
passing
i
recollect
only
that
there
came
over
me
a
strange
and
sudden
sense
of
loss
as
though
some
had
gone
out
from
me
of
pain
there
was
none
nor
any
mental
anxiety
i
recollect
only
an
ethereal
lightness
of
limb
and
a
sense
of
and
peace
a
sense
of
such
as
one
might
feel
were
he
to
awaken
on
a
sunny
summer
morning
to
find
that
sorrow
and
sin
were
gone
from
the
world
for
ever
a
peace
ample
and
restful
as
the
hallowed
hush
and
awe
of
twilight
without
the
tender
pain
then
i
seemed
to
be
sinking
slowly
and
steadily
through
still
depths
of
waters
that
sang
in
my
ears
with
a
sound
like
a
sweet
sad
sobbing
and
soaring
of
music
and
through
which
there
swam
up
to
me
in
watered
vistas
of
light
scenes
of
sunny
seas
and
shining
shores
where
smiling
isles
stretched
league
beyond
league
afar
and
so
life
ebbed
away
until
there
came
a
time
when
the
outward
and
tide
seemed
to
reach
its
climax
and
when
i
felt
myself
swept
shoreward
and
lifeward
again
on
the
tide
of
that
larger
life
into
which
i
had
died
my
next
recollection
is
that
the
events
of
my
past
life
were
rising
before
me
the
hands
on
the
dial
of
time
went
back
a
score
of
years
and
i
was
a
young
man
of
living
in
chambers
off
holborn
one
evening
there
burst
over
london
a
fearful
thunderstorm
and
hearing
a
knock
at
my
door
i
opened
it
to
find
a
beautiful
girl
named
dorothy
the
daughter
of
the
housekeeper
standing
there
terrified
by
the
lightning
and
finding
herself
alone
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
remain
until
her
mother
return
the
words
had
scarcely
passed
her
lips
before
there
came
another
blinding
flash
of
lightning
followed
almost
instantaneously
by
a
terrific
crash
of
thunder
with
a
cry
of
passion
and
fear
she
flung
her
arms
around
me
and
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
pressing
her
to
my
heart
and
telling
her
amid
a
score
of
burning
kisses
that
i
loved
her
almost
immediately
afterwards
we
heard
the
opening
of
doors
which
indicated
her
mother
but
before
leaving
dorothy
told
me
that
the
room
immediately
above
mine
was
her
own
of
the
thought
which
rose
in
my
mind
as
i
listened
she
i
am
sure
had
no
suspicion
need
i
tell
the
remainder
of
my
story
i
think
not
you
may
wonder
perhaps
why
i
recall
circumstances
that
happened
so
many
years
ago
you
would
cease
to
wonder
had
you
seen
the
ghost
of
the
past
rise
up
to
call
upon
god
and
his
christ
for
judgment
upon
the
betrayer
for
this
was
my
first
glimpse
of
hell
this
was
my
day
of
judgment
the
recording
angel
of
my
awakened
conscience
showed
me
my
sin
and
the
ruin
my
sin
had
wrought
as
god
sees
and
i
realised
that
but
no
i
am
sick
i
am
fainting
i
can
not
i
can
not
write
more
the
secret
of
man
when
anyone
dies
i
had
been
told
in
childhood
he
goes
either
to
heaven
or
to
hell
according
to
whether
he
has
been
a
good
or
bad
man
and
i
recollect
being
not
a
little
troubled
as
to
what
became
of
the
people
whose
virtues
were
about
equally
matched
with
their
vices
when
i
opened
my
eyes
in
that
of
the
into
which
i
have
had
admittance
i
discovered
that
heaven
and
hell
as
separate
places
have
no
existence
for
the
good
the
bad
and
the
indifferent
exist
together
exactly
as
they
exist
here
i
do
not
say
that
there
will
be
no
day
of
harvesting
in
which
the
tares
shall
finally
be
separated
from
the
wheat
on
that
point
as
on
many
others
i
am
ignorant
men
and
women
whom
i
know
on
earth
speak
of
the
dead
the
changed
as
being
perfected
in
knowledge
and
as
having
solved
for
ever
the
great
secret
that
is
not
my
experience
so
far
from
the
great
secret
the
secret
of
man
destiny
and
being
becoming
known
at
death
the
facts
as
i
found
them
are
that
these
remain
almost
as
great
a
mystery
after
death
as
before
even
in
hell
i
use
the
word
as
indicating
mental
or
physical
suffering
in
my
case
the
former
not
with
any
local
significance
there
are
moments
when
the
spirit
is
mercifully
allowed
a
temporary
reprieve
such
a
moment
occurred
after
the
first
awful
paroxysm
of
and
torture
which
i
experienced
when
my
past
life
was
made
known
to
me
in
its
true
colours
and
it
was
in
this
saner
and
comparatively
painless
interval
that
i
met
one
whom
i
had
known
on
earth
as
a
woman
of
the
purest
life
and
character
being
still
under
the
impression
that
i
was
in
hell
in
the
sense
in
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
think
of
that
place
i
started
back
upon
seeing
her
and
cried
out
in
astonishment
you
here
and
in
hades
where
else
should
i
be
except
where
arthur
is
she
answered
quietly
and
i
then
remembered
a
worthless
brother
of
that
name
to
whom
she
was
passionately
attached
even
dives
in
the
parable
she
went
on
was
unable
to
forget
the
five
brethren
he
had
left
behind
him
and
cried
out
amid
the
flames
asking
that
lazarus
be
sent
to
warn
them
lest
they
too
came
to
that
place
of
torment
is
it
likely
then
that
any
wife
mother
or
sister
worthy
the
name
would
be
content
to
remain
idle
in
heaven
knowing
that
a
loved
one
was
in
hell
and
in
agony
we
are
told
that
after
his
death
christ
preached
to
the
spirits
in
prison
and
i
believe
that
he
came
here
to
hell
in
search
of
the
lost
tell
me
i
said
you
who
are
in
heaven
if
you
are
perfectly
happy
you
are
not
altogether
wrong
in
calling
this
heaven
she
replied
although
it
is
little
more
than
the
antechamber
between
earth
and
heaven
it
is
my
heaven
at
present
but
it
will
not
be
my
heaven
always
any
more
than
it
will
be
always
your
hell
and
although
it
is
heaven
it
is
not
heaven
when
i
was
on
earth
i
longed
for
heaven
that
i
might
be
delivered
from
sorrow
but
from
and
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
am
as
happy
here
as
my
failures
will
let
me
be
your
failures
i
exclaimed
i
thought
we
had
done
with
failures
you
remember
the
text
in
the
koran
she
said
is
under
the
shadow
of
swords
here
as
on
earth
there
is
no
progress
without
effort
and
here
too
there
are
difficulties
to
be
overcome
yet
even
on
earth
there
was
one
element
in
the
strife
which
lent
dignity
even
to
our
failures
sin
and
shame
are
after
all
only
human
the
effort
and
determination
to
overcome
them
are
divine
ceasing
to
be
an
angel
satan
became
a
devil
man
falls
and
even
in
his
fall
retains
something
of
god
after
a
time
we
fell
to
talking
of
the
past
and
mentioning
the
name
of
the
very
noblest
man
i
have
ever
known
a
man
who
made
possible
the
purity
of
sir
galahad
made
possible
the
courage
of
coeur
de
lion
i
had
almost
said
made
possible
the
sinfulness
of
christ
i
inquired
whether
she
had
seen
him
in
paradise
as
yet
she
answered
i
know
only
one
of
the
many
circles
into
which
the
seems
naturally
to
resolve
it
but
i
suspect
that
if
you
and
i
could
see
where
he
is
we
should
find
him
infinitely
nearer
to
the
of
the
universe
than
i
at
least
can
for
countless
ages
hope
to
attain
what
do
you
mean
by
i
said
is
each
human
soul
on
its
arrival
here
assigned
a
fitting
place
and
level
among
his
or
her
spiritual
fellows
there
is
some
such
gathering
of
like
to
like
as
that
of
which
you
speak
she
answered
the
majority
begin
in
a
lower
circle
and
remain
there
until
they
are
fitted
to
move
onward
to
a
higher
sphere
others
take
a
place
in
that
higher
sphere
immediately
and
some
few
are
led
into
the
holy
presence
straightway
and
then
her
voice
seemed
to
sound
to
me
like
the
voice
of
one
in
the
far
distance
i
felt
the
darkness
closing
in
upon
me
on
every
side
and
knew
that
my
hour
of
punishment
was
again
at
hand
dead
of
all
the
faces
which
i
saw
in
hell
there
was
one
which
had
for
me
a
fascination
it
was
that
of
a
beautiful
woman
queenly
of
manner
fair
of
figure
as
a
fullblown
lily
and
with
those
dark
eyes
that
seem
to
shine
out
from
deep
as
the
distant
heaven
and
yet
may
mean
no
more
than
the
shallow
facing
of
quicksilver
behind
a
mirror
on
earth
she
had
deliberately
set
herself
to
win
and
to
break
the
heart
of
a
trusting
lad
and
the
punishment
of
her
sin
was
that
she
should
now
love
him
with
the
same
intense
but
hopeless
passion
with
which
he
had
loved
her
my
heart
is
broken
i
heard
her
sob
and
in
hell
one
can
not
die
of
a
broken
heart
if
i
had
loved
him
and
he
me
and
he
had
died
i
could
have
borne
it
knowing
that
i
should
meet
him
hereafter
but
to
live
loveless
through
eternity
that
is
the
thought
which
kills
me
another
sight
which
i
saw
was
that
of
a
desolate
plain
and
unlighted
in
the
centre
of
which
there
roamed
one
who
called
out
as
if
in
search
of
a
companion
but
to
whom
there
came
no
answer
save
the
echo
of
his
own
voice
a
more
lonely
and
lifeless
spot
i
have
never
seen
the
silence
seemed
sometimes
to
oppress
him
like
a
presence
for
with
a
and
despairing
cry
he
set
off
at
a
run
as
if
seeking
to
escape
this
silence
by
flight
but
notwithstanding
his
haste
he
made
no
progress
for
he
was
but
moving
round
and
round
in
a
circle
once
when
he
passed
near
me
i
heard
him
cry
out
is
there
no
living
soul
in
all
this
void
and
voiceless
desert
and
as
he
hurried
by
i
recognised
him
as
a
man
whom
i
had
often
heard
say
on
earth
that
hell
would
not
be
hell
to
him
so
long
as
he
and
his
boon
companions
were
together
another
whom
i
saw
in
hades
i
should
save
for
his
pitiable
effort
to
escape
observation
have
passed
unnoticed
his
pitfall
in
life
had
been
love
of
approbation
which
was
so
strong
that
he
was
never
happy
except
in
perpetually
endeavoring
to
pass
himself
off
for
that
which
he
knew
he
was
not
the
only
aim
of
his
existence
had
been
to
win
the
approval
of
others
and
lo
one
morning
he
awoke
in
hades
to
find
himself
the
despised
of
the
despised
and
the
laughing
stock
of
the
very
devil
i
saw
few
more
pitiable
sights
than
that
of
this
wretched
creature
slinking
shamefacedly
through
hell
and
wincing
as
from
a
blow
at
the
glance
of
every
passer
during
my
wanderings
i
had
reason
to
ask
one
whom
i
had
known
on
earth
concerning
the
fate
of
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
own
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
of
the
man
about
whom
you
ask
he
said
but
first
let
me
explain
that
my
sorest
hindrance
on
earth
was
unbelief
once
when
i
might
have
believed
i
would
not
and
my
punishment
is
that
now
when
i
would
believe
i
can
not
but
am
for
ever
torn
by
hideous
apprehension
and
doubt
moreover
there
are
many
things
which
clear
and
plain
as
they
may
be
to
the
faithful
of
heart
and
to
the
believing
are
to
my
doubting
eyes
wrapt
around
in
mystery
into
these
mysteries
it
has
been
ordained
as
part
of
my
punishment
that
i
shall
ever
desire
to
look
and
of
all
these
mysteries
there
is
none
which
fills
me
with
such
horror
and
dread
as
the
mystery
of
the
dead
who
die
of
the
dead
who
die
i
said
what
do
you
mean
by
those
strange
words
surely
all
who
die
are
dead
they
are
my
words
he
cried
excitedly
and
with
a
hysterical
laugh
the
words
i
use
to
myself
when
i
think
of
the
mystery
which
they
strove
so
carefully
to
conceal
from
me
but
which
for
all
their
cunning
i
have
discovered
when
first
i
came
here
i
saw
either
in
hell
or
in
heaven
the
faces
of
most
of
the
dead
whom
i
had
known
on
earth
but
some
faces
there
were
the
man
of
whom
you
ask
was
one
which
i
missed
and
from
that
time
to
this
i
have
never
seen
then
are
they
i
asked
myself
neither
earth
hell
nor
heaven
knows
them
more
has
god
some
fearful
fate
in
store
for
sinners
which
may
one
day
fall
upon
me
as
it
has
already
fallen
upon
them
and
so
i
set
myself
to
discover
what
had
become
of
these
missing
faces
and
you
shall
hear
the
result
when
you
and
i
were
children
we
were
taught
that
every
human
being
is
born
with
an
immortal
soul
but
they
did
not
tell
us
that
just
as
neglected
diseases
can
kill
the
body
so
unchecked
sin
can
kill
the
soul
but
it
is
so
and
that
is
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
he
of
whom
you
asked
was
the
dead
who
die
you
shake
your
head
and
mutter
that
i
am
mad
well
perhaps
i
am
mad
mad
with
the
horror
of
my
unbelief
but
why
should
it
not
be
as
i
say
when
god
made
man
he
made
a
creature
to
whom
it
was
given
to
choose
for
himself
between
good
and
evil
but
god
knew
that
some
of
those
he
had
thus
made
would
deliberately
choose
evil
that
some
few
would
indeed
sin
away
all
trace
of
their
divine
origin
god
did
not
it
so
for
he
made
us
men
not
machines
and
the
evil
we
do
is
of
our
own
choosing
but
god
it
and
foreknowing
that
god
owed
it
to
himself
not
to
call
into
being
a
creature
the
result
of
whose
creation
would
be
that
creature
eternal
misery
hence
it
was
that
he
decreed
that
those
for
whom
there
could
be
no
hope
of
heaven
should
die
out
at
their
deaths
like
the
brutes
our
life
is
from
god
and
may
not
god
take
his
own
again
and
could
anything
better
happen
to
many
people
whom
you
and
i
have
known
on
earth
than
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
die
out
and
the
very
memory
of
them
to
pass
away
for
ever
i
was
convinced
that
he
was
mad
mad
as
he
had
himself
hinted
with
the
horror
of
his
unbelief
and
i
am
one
of
them
he
exclaimed
i
am
of
the
dead
who
die
i
have
bartered
away
life
faith
and
happiness
for
dead
sea
fruit
i
who
once
was
young
and
not
altogether
as
i
now
am
a
soulless
creature
of
clay
for
i
can
remember
the
time
when
flowers
pictures
beautiful
faces
and
music
set
stirring
emotions
within
me
in
which
it
seemed
that
i
saw
hidden
away
in
the
depths
of
my
own
heart
the
shining
form
of
a
who
cried
out
to
me
can
not
you
make
your
life
as
pure
and
beautiful
as
the
flowers
and
the
music
that
so
you
may
set
me
free
but
i
chose
the
ignoble
part
and
gave
myself
up
body
and
soul
to
evil
and
unbelief
and
often
in
the
hour
when
i
was
tempted
to
some
shameful
action
i
seemed
to
see
the
white
arms
of
the
uplifted
in
piteous
entreaty
to
heaven
but
at
last
the
time
came
when
her
voice
was
silent
and
when
i
knew
that
i
had
thrust
her
down
into
a
darkness
whence
she
would
never
again
come
forth
and
now
the
very
soul
of
me
is
dead
and
i
know
not
but
that
at
any
moment
i
may
flicker
out
like
a
spent
taper
and
become
as
one
of
the
dead
who
die
on
the
brink
of
the
at
last
there
came
a
time
even
in
hell
when
the
burden
of
my
sin
lay
so
heavily
upon
me
that
i
felt
if
succour
there
was
none
the
very
soul
of
me
must
die
of
myself
save
for
the
continual
crying
out
of
my
soul
after
its
lost
purity
i
scarcely
cared
to
think
it
was
for
dorothy
that
i
never
ceased
to
sorrow
and
sinner
though
i
was
to
pray
i
saw
then
pictured
forth
in
all
their
horror
the
inevitable
consequences
of
the
wrong
i
had
done
her
i
saw
her
with
the
sense
of
her
sin
as
yet
but
fresh
upon
her
shrinking
from
every
glance
and
fancying
that
she
read
the
knowledge
of
her
guilt
in
every
eye
i
saw
her
not
knowing
where
to
turn
for
refuge
from
swiftly
advancing
shame
and
understanding
no
more
of
this
life
of
ours
than
a
foolish
lost
lamb
wandering
farther
and
farther
in
the
nightfall
and
then
driven
out
from
their
midst
by
the
very
christian
women
who
should
have
been
the
first
to
have
held
out
a
hand
to
save
i
saw
her
turn
away
with
a
heart
hardened
into
indifference
and
plunge
headlong
into
a
bottomless
gulf
of
ignominy
and
sin
nor
did
the
vision
pass
until
out
of
that
seething
vortex
of
lust
and
infamy
i
saw
arise
the
black
phantom
of
a
lost
soul
crying
out
unto
god
and
his
christ
for
judgment
upon
the
betrayer
as
these
hideous
spectres
of
the
past
came
before
me
i
fell
to
the
ground
borne
down
by
a
burden
of
agony
greater
even
than
the
very
damned
in
hell
can
bear
but
even
as
i
fell
that
burden
was
lifted
and
borne
away
from
me
and
then
i
saw
as
in
a
vision
one
kneeling
in
prayer
and
i
who
had
cried
out
that
i
could
bear
the
burden
of
my
sin
no
longer
saw
that
upon
him
was
laid
not
only
my
sin
but
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
and
that
he
stooped
of
his
own
accord
to
receive
them
and
as
i
looked
upon
the
divine
dignity
of
that
agonised
form
forsaken
of
his
father
that
we
might
never
be
forsaken
i
saw
great
beads
of
blood
break
out
like
sweat
upon
his
brow
and
i
heard
wrung
from
him
a
cry
of
such
unutterable
anguish
as
never
before
rose
from
human
lips
and
at
that
cry
the
vision
passed
and
i
awoke
to
find
myself
in
hell
once
more
but
in
my
heart
there
was
a
stirring
as
of
the
wings
of
hope
the
hope
which
i
had
deemed
dead
for
ever
it
be
o
god
of
mercy
was
it
possible
that
even
now
it
might
not
be
too
late
that
there
was
indeed
one
who
could
make
my
sin
as
though
it
had
never
been
but
to
this
hope
there
succeeded
a
moment
when
the
agonised
thought
how
if
there
be
no
christ
leapt
out
at
me
like
the
darkness
which
looms
but
the
blacker
for
the
a
moment
when
hell
got
hold
of
me
again
and
a
thousand
gibbering
devils
arose
to
shriek
in
my
ear
and
though
there
be
a
christ
is
it
not
now
too
late
i
reeled
at
that
cry
and
the
darkness
once
more
closed
in
around
a
horde
of
hideous
thoughts
the
very
spawn
of
hell
swarmed
like
vermin
in
my
mind
there
was
the
breath
as
of
a
host
of
contending
fiends
upon
my
face
a
hundred
hungry
hands
seemed
to
lay
hold
on
me
and
to
strive
to
drag
me
down
and
down
to
a
bottomless
pit
that
opened
at
my
very
feet
and
into
which
i
felt
myself
slipping
with
a
great
cry
to
god
i
strove
to
rise
but
my
strength
failed
me
and
i
had
fallen
back
into
the
abyss
had
not
one
as
the
morning
come
suddenly
to
succour
me
by
stretching
forth
a
hand
of
aid
and
so
beating
and
battling
like
a
drowning
man
for
breath
i
fought
my
way
out
and
fell
sobbing
and
faint
upon
the
pit
brink
and
with
a
great
cry
of
anguish
i
prayed
aloud
lord
christ
i
am
foul
and
sinful
i
do
not
know
that
i
love
thee
i
do
not
even
know
that
i
have
repented
of
my
sins
i
only
know
that
i
can
not
do
the
things
i
would
do
and
that
i
can
never
undo
the
evil
i
have
done
but
i
come
to
thee
lord
jesus
i
come
to
thee
as
thou
biddest
me
send
me
not
away
o
saviour
of
sinners
as
i
made
an
end
of
praying
i
looked
up
and
saw
standing
beside
me
one
and
with
wounded
side
features
were
the
features
of
a
man
but
whose
face
was
the
face
of
and
as
i
looked
upon
that
face
i
shrank
back
dazed
and
breathless
and
blinded
shrank
back
with
a
cry
like
the
cry
of
one
smitten
of
the
lightning
for
beneath
the
wide
white
brows
there
shone
out
eyes
before
the
awful
purity
of
which
my
soul
seemed
to
scorch
and
to
shrivel
like
a
scroll
in
a
furnace
but
as
i
lay
lo
there
came
a
tender
touch
upon
my
head
and
a
voice
in
my
ear
that
whispered
son
and
as
the
word
died
away
into
a
silence
like
the
hallowed
hush
of
listening
angels
and
i
stretched
forth
my
arms
with
a
cry
of
unutterable
longing
and
love
i
say
that
he
held
one
by
the
hand
even
the
one
who
had
plucked
me
out
of
the
abyss
into
which
i
had
fallen
and
i
saw
that
it
was
dorothy
dorothy
whom
he
had
sought
out
and
saved
from
the
shame
to
which
my
sin
had
driven
her
and
whom
he
had
sent
to
succour
me
that
so
he
might
set
upon
my
soul
the
seal
of
his
pardon
and
of
his
peace

i
am
a
cockney
among
cockneys
my
earliest
recollections
are
of
a
suburban
street
of
his
jumble
of
little
shops
and
little
terraces
my
mother
was
a
widow
my
father
whom
i
can
not
recollect
was
a
small
retail
tradesman
in
the
city
he
was
unfortunate
and
when
he
died
as
many
small
tradesmen
do
of
bad
debts
and
a
broken
heart
he
left
us
beggars
and
my
mother
came
down
and
lived
penuriously
enough
in
that
suburban
street
my
mother
moved
by
rule
and
method
by
god
law
as
she
considered
and
that
only
she
seldom
smiled
she
never
commanded
twice
without
punishing
and
yet
she
kept
the
strictest
watch
over
our
morality
sometimes
on
a
sunday
evening
the
ministers
of
the
baptist
chapel
would
come
in
to
supper
after
the
meeting
the
elder
was
a
old
man
who
loved
me
and
i
loved
him
too
for
there
were
always
lollipops
in
his
pocket
for
me
and
for
my
only
sister
susan
the
other
was
a
younger
man
tall
and
dark
he
preached
a
harsher
doctrine
than
his
gentler
colleague
and
was
much
the
greater
favourite
at
the
chapel
i
hated
him
and
years
later
he
married
my
sister
when
i
had
turned
thirteen
my
father
brother
who
had
risen
in
wealth
and
now
was
the
owner
of
a
grocery
business
in
the
city
and
a
pleasant
villa
at
herne
hill
and
had
a
son
preparing
for
cambridge
came
to
visit
us
when
he
had
gone
my
mother
told
me
very
solemnly
and
slowly
that
i
was
to
be
sent
to
a
tailor
workrooms
the
next
day
what
could
my
uncle
make
me
but
a
tailor
or
a
shoemaker
a
pale
consumptive
boy
all
forehead
and
no
muscle
with
a
beating
heart
i
shambled
along
by
my
mother
side
to
shop
in
a
street
off
piccadilly
and
here
smith
handed
me
over
to
jones
the
foreman
with
instructions
to
take
the
young
man
upstairs
to
the
workroom
i
stumbled
after
jones
up
a
dark
narrow
iron
staircase
till
we
emerged
through
a
into
a
garret
at
the
top
of
the
house
i
recoiled
with
disgust
at
the
scene
before
me
and
here
i
was
to
work
perhaps
through
life
a
low
room
stifling
me
with
the
combined
odours
of
human
breath
and
perspiration
stale
beer
the
sweet
sickly
smell
of
gin
and
the
sour
and
hardly
less
disgusting
one
of
new
cloth
on
the
floor
thick
with
dust
and
dirt
scraps
of
stuff
and
ends
of
thread
sat
some
dozen
haggard
untidy
shoeless
men
with
a
mingled
look
of
care
and
recklessness
that
made
me
shudder
the
windows
were
to
keep
out
the
cold
winter
air
and
the
condensed
breath
ran
in
streams
down
the
panes
the
foreman
turned
to
one
of
the
men
and
said
here
crossthwaite
take
this
younker
and
make
a
tailor
of
him
keep
him
next
you
and
prick
him
with
your
needle
if
he
shirks
mechanically
as
if
in
a
dream
i
sat
down
and
as
the
foreman
vanished
a
burst
of
chatter
rose
a
tall
young
man
bawled
in
my
ear
i
say
young
do
you
know
why
we
nearer
heaven
here
than
our
neighbours
why
i
asked
acause
we
the
top
of
the
house
in
the
first
place
and
next
place
yer
die
here
six
months
sooner
nor
if
yer
worked
in
the
room
below
concentrated
essence
of
man
flesh
is
this
here
as
you
cellar
workroom
we
calls
rheumatic
ward
acause
of
the
damp
ground
floor
fever
ward
your
nose
tell
yer
why
if
you
opened
the
back
windy
first
floor
ashmy
ward
do
you
hear
now
through
the
cracks
in
the
boards
apuffing
away
like
a
nest
of
young
locomotives
and
this
here
most
august
and
uppercrust
is
the
consumptive
hospital
first
you
begins
to
cough
then
you
proceeds
to
expectorate
and
then
when
you
sufficiently
covered
the
poor
dear
shivering
backs
of
the
hairystocracy
die
die
die
away
you
fly
your
soul
is
in
the
sky
as
the
hinspired
shakespeare
wittily
remarks
and
the
ribald
lay
down
on
his
back
stretched
himself
out
and
pretended
to
die
in
a
fit
of
coughing
which
last
was
alas
no
counterfeit
while
poor
i
shocked
and
bewildered
let
my
tears
fall
fast
upon
my
knees
i
never
told
my
mother
into
what
pandemonium
i
had
fallen
but
from
that
time
my
great
desire
was
to
get
knowledge
i
fancied
that
getting
knowledge
i
should
surely
get
wisdom
and
books
i
thought
would
tell
me
all
i
needed
that
was
how
it
was
i
came
to
know
sandy
mackaye
whose
old
i
used
to
pass
on
my
walk
homeward
one
evening
as
i
was
reading
one
of
the
books
on
his
stall
the
old
man
called
me
in
and
asked
me
abruptly
my
name
and
trade
and
family
i
told
him
all
and
confessed
my
love
of
books
and
mackaye
encouraged
me
and
taught
me
latin
and
soon
had
me
to
lodge
in
his
old
shop
for
my
mother
in
her
stern
religion
would
not
have
me
at
home
because
i
could
not
believe
in
the
christianity
which
i
heard
preached
in
the
baptist
chapel
i
move
among
the
the
death
of
our
employer
threw
many
of
us
out
of
work
for
the
son
who
succeeded
to
the
business
determined
to
go
ahead
with
the
times
and
to
that
end
decided
to
go
in
for
the
which
meant
an
alteration
in
the
premises
the
demolition
of
the
and
the
giving
out
of
the
work
to
be
made
up
at
the
men
own
homes
mackaye
would
have
me
stay
with
him
ye
just
mind
the
shop
and
dust
the
books
whiles
he
said
but
this
i
would
not
do
for
i
thought
the
old
man
could
not
afford
to
keep
me
in
addition
to
himself
then
he
suggested
that
i
should
go
to
cambridge
and
see
my
cousin
with
a
view
to
getting
the
poems
published
which
i
had
been
writing
ever
since
i
started
tailoring
he
bound
to
it
by
blude
said
sandy
and
i
thinking
ye
better
try
to
get
a
list
o
subscribers
so
to
cambridge
i
went
it
was
some
time
since
i
had
seen
my
cousin
george
and
at
our
last
meeting
he
had
taken
me
to
the
dulwich
gallery
it
was
there
that
two
young
ladies
one
so
beautiful
that
i
was
dazzled
and
an
elderly
clergyman
whom
my
cousin
told
me
was
a
dean
had
spoken
to
me
about
the
pictures
and
that
interview
marked
a
turning
point
in
my
life
when
i
got
to
cambridge
and
had
found
my
cousin
rooms
i
was
received
kindly
enough
you
could
have
got
on
at
tailoring
much
too
sharp
a
fellow
for
that
he
said
on
hearing
my
story
you
ought
to
be
at
college
if
one
could
only
get
you
there
those
poems
of
yours
you
must
let
me
have
them
and
look
over
them
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
able
to
persuade
the
governor
to
do
something
with
them
lord
lynedale
came
to
my
cousin
rooms
next
day
george
told
me
plainly
that
he
made
friends
with
those
who
would
advance
him
when
he
was
a
clergyman
and
taking
an
interest
in
a
author
bade
me
bring
my
poems
to
the
eagle
and
ask
for
dean
winnstay
lord
lynedale
was
to
marry
dean
winnstay
niece
when
i
arrived
at
the
eagle
the
first
person
i
saw
was
lillian
for
so
her
father
the
dean
called
her
the
younger
lady
my
heroine
of
the
dulwich
gallery
looking
more
beautiful
than
ever
i
could
have
fallen
down
fool
that
i
was
and
worshipped
what
i
could
not
tell
you
for
i
can
not
tell
even
now
the
dean
smiled
recognition
bade
me
sit
down
and
disposed
my
papers
on
his
knee
i
obeyed
him
trembling
my
eyes
devouring
my
idol
forgetting
why
i
had
come
seeing
nothing
but
her
listening
for
nothing
but
the
opening
of
those
lips
i
think
i
may
tell
you
at
once
that
i
am
very
much
surprised
and
gratified
with
your
poems
said
the
old
gentleman
how
very
fond
of
beautiful
things
you
must
be
locke
said
lillian
to
be
able
to
describe
so
passionately
the
longing
after
them
i
stammered
out
something
about
having
very
few
opportunities
of
indulging
the
taste
for
i
forget
what
ah
yes
i
dare
say
it
must
be
a
very
stupid
life
so
little
opportunity
as
he
says
what
a
pity
he
is
a
tailor
papa
such
an
unimaginative
employment
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
send
him
to
college
and
make
him
a
clergyman
fool
that
i
was
i
fancied
what
did
i
not
fancy
never
seeing
how
that
very
bespoke
the
indifference
the
gulf
between
us
i
was
not
a
man
an
equal
but
a
thing
a
subject
who
was
to
be
talked
over
and
examined
and
made
into
something
like
themselves
of
their
supreme
and
undeserved
benevolence
gently
gently
fair
lady
said
the
dean
we
must
not
be
as
headlong
as
some
people
would
kindly
wish
to
be
if
this
young
man
really
has
a
proper
desire
to
rise
to
a
higher
station
and
i
find
him
a
fit
object
to
be
assisted
in
that
praiseworthy
ambition
why
i
think
he
ought
to
go
to
some
training
college
now
attend
to
me
sir
recollect
if
it
should
be
in
our
power
to
assist
your
prospects
in
life
you
must
give
up
once
and
for
all
the
bitter
tone
against
the
higher
classes
which
i
am
sorry
to
see
in
your
mss
next
i
think
of
showing
these
mss
to
my
publisher
to
get
opinion
as
to
whether
they
are
worth
printing
just
now
not
that
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
be
a
poet
most
active
minds
write
poetry
at
a
certain
age
i
wrote
a
good
deal
i
recollect
myself
but
that
is
no
reason
for
publishing
at
this
point
lillian
fled
the
room
to
my
extreme
disgust
but
still
the
old
man
prosed
i
think
therefore
that
you
had
better
stay
with
your
cousin
for
the
next
week
i
hear
from
lord
lynedale
that
he
is
a
very
studious
moral
rising
young
man
and
i
only
hope
that
you
will
follow
his
good
example
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
shall
return
home
and
then
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
more
of
you
at
my
house
at
d
my
cousin
and
i
stayed
at
d
long
enough
for
the
dean
to
get
a
reply
from
the
publishers
concerning
my
poems
they
thought
that
the
sale
of
the
book
might
be
greatly
facilitated
if
certain
passages
of
a
strong
political
tendency
were
omitted
they
were
somewhat
too
strong
for
the
present
state
of
the
public
taste
on
the
dean
advice
i
weakly
consented
to
have
the
book
emasculated
next
day
i
returned
to
town
for
sandy
mackaye
had
written
me
a
characteristic
note
telling
me
that
he
could
deposit
any
trash
i
had
written
in
a
paper
called
the
weekly
warwhoop
before
i
went
from
d
my
cousin
george
warned
me
not
to
pay
so
much
attention
to
miss
lillian
if
i
wished
to
stand
well
with
eleanor
the
dean
niece
who
was
to
marry
lord
lynedale
he
left
me
suspecting
that
he
had
remarked
eleanor
wish
to
cool
my
admiration
for
lillian
and
was
willing
for
his
own
purposes
to
further
it
riot
and
at
last
my
poems
were
printed
and
published
and
i
enjoyed
the
sensation
of
being
a
real
live
author
what
was
more
my
book
took
and
sold
and
was
reviewed
favourably
in
journals
and
newspapers
it
struck
me
that
it
would
be
right
to
call
upon
the
dean
and
so
i
went
to
his
house
off
harley
street
the
good
old
man
congratulated
me
on
my
success
and
i
saw
lillian
and
sat
in
a
delirium
of
silent
joy
lord
lynedale
had
become
lord
ellerton
and
i
listened
to
the
praises
that
were
sung
of
the
newly
married
couple
for
eleanor
had
become
lady
ellerton
and
had
entered
fully
into
all
her
husband
magnificent
philanthropic
schemes
a
helpmeet
if
not
an
oracular
guide
after
this
i
had
an
invitation
to
tea
in
lillian
own
hand
and
then
came
terrible
news
that
lord
ellerton
had
been
killed
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
and
that
the
dean
and
miss
winnstay
had
left
london
and
for
three
years
i
saw
them
no
more
what
happened
in
those
three
years
mackaye
had
warned
me
not
to
follow
after
vanity
he
was
a
chartist
and
with
him
and
crossthwaite
my
old
i
was
vowed
to
the
good
cause
of
the
charter
now
i
found
that
i
had
fallen
under
suspicion
can
you
wonder
if
our
friends
suspect
you
said
crossthwaite
can
you
deny
that
you
been
off
and
on
lately
between
flunkeydom
and
the
cause
like
a
donkey
between
two
bundles
of
hay
have
you
not
neglected
our
meetings
have
you
not
picked
all
the
spice
out
of
your
poems
though
sandy
is
too
to
tell
you
you
have
disappointed
us
both
miserably
and
there
the
long
and
short
of
it
i
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
my
conscience
told
me
that
i
had
nothing
to
answer
mackaye
to
spare
me
went
on
to
talk
of
the
agricultural
distress
and
crossthwaite
explained
that
he
wanted
to
send
a
deputation
down
to
the
country
to
spread
the
principles
of
the
charter
i
will
go
i
said
starting
up
they
shall
see
i
do
care
for
the
cause
where
is
the
place
about
ten
miles
from
d
d
my
heart
sank
if
it
had
been
any
other
spot
but
it
was
too
late
to
retract
with
many
instructions
from
our
friends
and
warnings
from
mackaye
i
started
next
day
on
my
journey
i
arrived
in
the
midst
of
a
dreary
treeless
country
and
a
little
pert
shoemaker
met
me
and
we
walked
together
across
the
open
down
towards
a
circular
camp
the
earthwork
probably
of
some
old
british
town
inside
it
some
thousand
or
so
of
labouring
people
all
wan
and
haggard
with
many
women
among
them
were
swarming
restlessly
round
a
single
large
block
of
stone
i
made
my
way
to
the
stone
and
listened
as
speaker
after
speaker
poured
out
a
string
of
incoherent
complaints
only
the
intense
earnestness
gave
any
force
to
the
speeches
i
noticed
that
many
of
the
crowd
carried
heavy
sticks
and
pitchforks
and
other
tools
which
might
be
used
as
fearful
weapons
and
when
a
fierce
man
with
a
squint
asked
who
would
be
willing
to
come
and
pull
the
farm
about
the
folks
ears
i
felt
that
now
or
never
was
the
time
for
me
to
speak
if
once
the
spirit
of
mad
aimless
riot
broke
loose
i
had
not
only
no
chance
of
a
hearing
but
every
likelihood
of
being
implicated
in
deeds
which
i
abhorred
i
sprang
on
the
stone
assured
them
of
the
sympathy
of
the
london
and
explained
the
idea
of
the
charter
to
all
which
they
answered
surlily
that
they
did
not
know
anything
about
politics
that
what
they
wanted
was
bread
in
vain
i
went
on
more
vehement
than
ever
the
only
answer
was
that
they
wanted
bread
and
bread
we
will
have
go
then
i
cried
losing
my
go
and
get
bread
after
all
you
have
a
right
to
it
there
are
rights
above
all
laws
and
the
right
to
live
is
one
i
had
no
time
to
finish
the
murmur
swelled
into
a
roar
for
bread
bread
and
amid
yells
and
execrations
the
whole
mass
poured
down
the
hill
sweeping
me
away
with
them
i
was
shocked
and
terrified
at
their
threats
i
shouted
myself
hoarse
about
the
duty
of
honesty
warned
them
against
pillage
and
violence
but
my
voice
was
drowned
in
the
uproar
i
felt
i
had
helped
to
excite
them
and
dare
not
in
honour
desert
them
and
trembling
i
went
on
prepared
to
see
the
worst
a
large
mass
of
farm
buildings
lay
before
us
and
the
mob
rushed
tumultuously
into
the
yard
just
in
time
to
see
an
old
man
on
horseback
gallop
hatless
away
the
old
rascal
gone
and
he
call
up
the
yeomanry
we
must
be
quick
boys
shouted
one
the
invaders
entered
the
house
and
returned
cramming
their
mouths
with
bread
and
chopping
asunder
flitches
of
bacon
the
granary
doors
were
broken
open
and
the
contents
were
scrambled
for
amid
immense
waste
by
the
starving
wretches
soon
the
yard
was
a
pandemonium
as
the
more
ruffianly
part
of
the
mob
hurled
furniture
out
of
windows
or
ran
off
with
anything
they
could
carry
the
ricks
had
been
fired
and
the
food
of
man
the
labour
of
years
devoured
in
aimless
ruin
when
some
one
shouted
the
yeomanry
and
at
that
sound
a
general
panic
ensued
i
did
not
care
to
run
i
was
utterly
disgusted
disappointed
with
myself
the
people
i
just
recollect
the
tramp
of
the
yeomanry
horses
and
a
clear
blade
gleaming
in
the
air
and
after
that
i
recollect
nothing
till
i
awoke
and
found
myself
lying
on
a
in
d
gaol
and
a
warder
wrapping
my
head
with
wet
towels
mackaye
engaged
an
old
compatriot
as
attorney
at
the
trial
and
i
was
congratulated
on
only
getting
three
years
the
weary
time
went
by
week
after
week
month
after
month
summer
after
summer
i
scored
the
days
off
like
a
lonely
schoolboy
on
the
pages
of
a
calendar
not
till
i
was
released
did
i
learn
from
sandy
mackaye
that
my
cousin
george
was
the
vicar
of
his
church
and
that
he
was
about
to
marry
lillian
winnstay
in
brave
old
sandy
mackaye
died
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
of
april
the
day
of
the
great
chartist
demonstration
at
kennington
common
mackaye
had
predicted
failure
and
every
one
of
his
predictions
came
true
the
people
did
not
rise
whatever
sympathy
they
had
with
us
they
did
not
care
to
show
it
the
meeting
broke
up
pitiably
piecemeal
drenched
and
cowed
body
and
soul
by
pouring
rain
that
same
night
after
wandering
dispiritedly
in
the
streets
by
the
river
i
was
sick
with
typhus
fever
i
know
not
for
how
long
my
dreams
and
delirium
lasted
but
i
know
that
at
last
i
sank
into
a
soft
weary
happy
sleep
then
the
spell
was
snapped
my
fever
and
my
dreams
faded
away
together
and
i
woke
to
the
twittering
of
the
sparrows
and
the
scent
of
the
poplars
and
found
eleanor
lady
ellerton
and
her
uncle
sitting
by
my
bed
and
with
them
crossthwaite
little
wife
i
would
have
spoken
but
eleanor
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
taking
her
uncle
arm
glided
from
the
room
slowly
and
with
relapses
into
insensibility
i
passed
like
one
who
recovers
from
drowning
through
the
painful
gate
of
birth
into
another
life
crossthwaite
and
his
wife
as
they
sat
by
me
tender
and
careful
nurses
both
told
me
in
time
that
to
eleanor
i
owed
all
my
comforts
she
an
angel
out
of
heaven
he
said
ah
alton
she
was
your
true
friend
all
the
time
and
not
that
other
one
if
you
had
but
known
it
i
could
not
rest
till
i
had
heard
more
of
lady
ellerton
why
then
she
lives
not
far
off
when
her
husband
died
she
came
my
wife
katie
tells
me
and
lived
for
one
year
down
somewhere
in
the
east
end
among
the
needlewomen
and
now
she
got
a
large
house
hereby
with
fifty
or
more
in
it
all
at
work
together
sharing
the
earnings
among
themselves
and
putting
into
their
own
pockets
the
profits
which
would
have
gone
to
their
tyrants
and
she
keeps
the
accounts
for
them
and
gets
the
goods
sold
and
manages
everything
and
reads
to
them
while
they
work
and
teaches
them
every
day
crossthwaite
went
on
to
speak
of
mackaye
when
old
mackaye
will
was
read
he
had
left
he
saved
to
be
parted
between
you
and
me
on
condition
that
we
go
and
cool
down
across
the
atlantic
and
if
it
had
been
for
your
illness
i
have
been
in
texas
now
often
did
i
see
eleanor
in
those
days
of
convalescence
but
it
was
not
till
a
month
had
gone
by
that
i
summoned
courage
to
ask
after
my
cousin
eleanor
looked
solemnly
at
me
did
you
not
know
it
he
is
dead
of
typhus
fever
he
died
three
weeks
ago
and
not
only
he
but
the
servant
who
brushed
his
clothes
and
the
shopman
who
had
a
few
days
before
brought
him
a
new
coat
home
how
did
you
learn
all
this
from
crossthwaite
who
found
out
that
you
most
probably
caught
your
fever
from
a
house
near
blackfriars
and
in
that
house
this
very
coat
had
been
turned
out
and
had
covered
a
body
dead
of
typhus
half
unconscious
i
stammered
lillian
name
inquiringly
she
is
much
changed
sorrow
and
sickness
for
she
too
has
had
the
fever
have
worn
her
down
little
remains
now
of
that
loveliness
which
i
idolised
in
my
folly
i
tried
to
turn
you
from
your
dream
i
knew
there
was
nothing
there
for
your
heart
to
rest
upon
i
was
even
angry
with
you
for
being
the
of
anyone
but
myself
eleanor
bade
me
go
and
i
obeyed
her
and
sailed
and
here
i
am
and
she
bade
me
write
faithfully
the
story
of
my
life
and
i
have
done
so
yes
i
have
seen
the
land
like
a
purple
fringe
upon
the
golden
sea
but
i
shall
never
reach
the
land
weaker
and
weaker
day
by
day
with
bleeding
lungs
and
failing
limbs
i
have
travelled
the
ocean
paths
the
iron
has
entered
too
deeply
into
my
soul
this
is
an
extract
from
a
letter
by
john
crossthwaite
galveston
texas
october
and
now
for
my
poor
friend
whose
papers
according
to
my
promise
to
him
i
transmit
to
you
on
the
very
night
on
which
he
seems
to
have
concluded
them
an
hour
after
we
had
made
the
land
we
found
him
in
his
cabin
dead
resting
peacefully
as
if
he
had
slumbered
hereward
the
wake
with
the
appearance
of
hereward
the
wake
sometimes
called
hereward
the
last
of
the
english
kingsley
brought
to
a
close
a
remarkable
series
of
works
of
fiction
although
the
story
was
not
published
until
the
germ
of
it
came
to
kingsley
according
to
kingsley
memoirs
of
her
husband
during
the
summer
of
while
on
a
visit
to
crowland
abbey
near
peterborough
with
the
rev
maurice
as
its
title
implies
the
romance
is
suggested
by
the
life
and
adventures
of
hereward
a
saxon
yeoman
who
flourished
about
the
story
itself
perhaps
does
not
move
along
with
the
same
spirit
and
vigour
that
characterise
kingsley
earlier
works
it
shows
nevertheless
that
he
had
lost
none
of
his
cunningness
for
dramatic
situations
nor
his
vivid
powers
of
visualising
scenes
and
events
of
the
past
hereward
seeks
his
in
the
year
of
canute
death
was
born
hereward
second
son
of
leofric
earl
of
mercia
and
godiva
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
was
a
wild
headstrong
passionate
lad
short
in
stature
but
very
broad
and
his
eyes
were
one
blue
and
one
grey
always
in
trouble
with
authority
the
climax
came
when
he
robbed
herluin
steward
of
peterborough
of
a
sum
of
sixteen
silver
pennies
collected
for
the
use
of
the
monastery
and
for
this
exploit
he
was
outlawed
accordingly
he
left
his
home
and
went
north
to
siward
who
was
engaged
in
war
with
macbeth
and
for
aught
we
know
he
may
have
helped
to
bring
great
birnam
wood
to
high
dunsinane
hill
however
that
may
be
he
stayed
in
scotland
with
one
gilbert
of
ghent
at
whose
house
among
other
doughty
deeds
he
slew
a
mighty
white
bear
that
escaped
from
captivity
incidentally
saving
the
life
of
a
pretty
little
maiden
named
alftruda
and
earning
the
hatred
of
the
other
men
who
had
not
dared
to
face
the
bear
finding
scotland
a
little
uncomfortable
in
consequence
he
went
to
cornwall
taking
with
him
only
his
faithful
servant
martin
and
there
at
the
court
of
alef
a
danish
kinglet
he
had
cause
to
kill
a
local
celebrity
a
giant
named
ironhook
who
was
betrothed
to
alef
daughter
though
much
against
her
will
she
being
in
love
with
sigtryg
son
of
ranald
king
of
waterford
so
hereward
went
to
waterford
with
a
ring
and
a
message
from
the
princess
returning
later
with
sigtryg
only
to
find
that
alef
had
betrothed
his
daughter
afresh
to
hannibal
of
marazion
and
the
wedding
ceremony
was
actually
proceeding
when
they
arrived
an
ambush
was
laid
for
the
returning
bridal
party
hannibal
duly
accounted
for
and
the
princess
carried
off
to
waterford
where
they
prepared
another
wedding
with
all
their
hearts
so
full
of
glee
earl
leofric
dead
hereward
determined
to
take
the
risk
of
returning
home
to
which
end
he
begged
two
ships
from
ranald
and
set
sail
thrown
by
a
storm
on
the
flanders
coast
he
and
all
his
men
were
like
to
have
been
knocked
on
the
head
after
the
friendly
custom
of
the
times
but
for
the
intervention
of
arnoul
grandson
of
baldwin
of
flanders
entering
his
service
hereward
assisted
baldwin
in
an
argument
with
eustace
of
guisnes
who
differed
with
his
lord
on
the
question
of
payment
of
certain
dues
and
so
keenly
did
he
reason
that
the
difference
of
opinion
was
satisfactorily
composed
from
baldwin
point
of
view
anon
a
war
with
holland
claimed
attention
but
in
the
meantime
hereward
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
most
beautiful
damsel
named
torfrida
niece
of
the
abbot
of
berlin
reputed
a
sorceress
her
favour
he
won
in
the
lists
from
sir
ascelin
to
whom
she
had
committed
it
and
upon
him
she
bestowed
it
together
with
her
love
and
a
suit
of
magic
armour
through
which
no
sword
could
pierce
then
hereward
went
off
to
holland
and
there
he
encountered
dirk
hammerhand
from
whom
to
take
a
buffet
was
never
to
need
another
and
bought
from
him
his
famous
mare
swallow
the
price
agreed
on
being
the
half
of
what
hereward
had
offered
and
a
box
on
the
ear
villain
groaned
dirk
as
he
lay
on
the
ground
it
was
i
who
was
to
give
the
buffet
not
thou
art
mad
said
hereward
as
he
coolly
picked
up
the
coins
which
dirk
had
scattered
in
his
fall
it
is
the
seller
business
to
take
and
the
buyer
to
give
in
holland
hereward
remained
a
year
but
as
under
the
terms
of
a
wager
made
in
a
boastful
mood
he
went
through
the
campaign
without
any
armour
and
without
changing
his
clothes
it
was
a
disreputable
looking
man
with
many
a
wound
who
returned
to
bruges
where
at
the
court
of
adela
a
jest
was
played
on
torfrida
by
the
countess
not
without
the
privity
of
hereward
for
before
all
her
ladies
adela
took
her
to
task
for
having
so
long
remained
unmarried
then
forming
the
assembly
into
a
court
of
love
she
asked
the
ladies
what
punishment
should
be
meted
out
one
said
one
thing
one
another
marry
her
to
a
fool
said
richilda
too
common
a
misfortune
said
the
lady
of
france
no
said
she
we
will
marry
her
to
the
first
man
who
enters
the
castle
and
from
her
sentence
there
was
no
appeal
married
poor
torfrida
must
be
and
to
the
first
man
who
happened
in
be
he
who
he
might
and
the
first
man
was
a
ragged
beggarman
with
whom
when
he
was
introduced
into
the
presence
torfrida
was
preparing
to
deal
in
her
own
way
with
a
little
knife
be
the
cost
what
it
might
when
she
recognised
the
eye
of
grey
and
the
eye
of
blue
hereward
encounters
some
old
in
the
spring
it
was
hey
for
the
war
again
whence
hereward
returned
in
november
to
find
himself
the
father
of
a
daughter
and
the
recipient
of
letters
from
harold
of
england
and
william
of
normandy
both
asking
his
assistance
regarding
harold
as
a
usurper
hereward
bluntly
told
him
so
to
william
his
reply
was
equally
decisive
but
less
uncompromising
when
william
is
king
of
all
england
hereward
will
put
his
hands
between
his
and
be
his
man
whereat
william
laughed
it
is
a
fair
challenge
from
a
valiant
man
he
said
to
the
messenger
the
day
shall
come
when
i
shall
claim
it
in
bruges
one
day
hereward
found
gilbert
of
ghent
who
for
reasons
of
his
own
had
come
thither
with
his
ward
alftruda
and
mightily
disappointed
was
gilbert
to
find
him
married
for
he
had
a
scheme
whereby
hereward
should
marry
alftruda
and
he
should
share
her
dowry
which
was
great
alftruda
too
was
mightily
displeased
as
she
seemed
one
whom
hereward
thought
the
most
beautiful
he
had
ever
beheld
indeed
for
one
moment
he
even
forgot
torfrida
and
gazed
at
her
spellbound
the
only
remark
she
vouchsafed
to
her
former
preserver
was
a
whispered
so
you
could
not
wait
for
me
and
then
passed
on
to
marry
dolfin
gospatric
eldest
son
and
gilbert
pursued
his
way
to
france
to
join
the
norman
after
that
news
came
thick
and
fast
news
of
harold
hardraada
sailing
to
england
with
a
mighty
host
of
how
the
gonfanon
of
peter
had
come
to
rouen
of
william
of
preparations
at
pierre
sur
dive
of
the
norsemen
landing
in
the
humber
anon
the
news
of
stamford
bridge
and
hardraada
death
and
lastly
news
of
senlac
and
the
death
of
the
other
harold
for
three
years
after
these
great
happenings
hereward
stayed
in
flanders
grieving
for
the
woes
that
had
come
upon
his
native
land
not
that
he
sat
moping
all
the
time
for
some
deed
of
arms
was
ever
on
hand
to
afford
distraction
but
in
the
main
his
thoughts
all
turned
on
schemes
for
freeing
england
from
the
french
tyrant
but
not
till
gyda
harold
widowed
mother
came
to
baldwin
for
sanctuary
did
he
take
any
overt
action
by
skilful
flattery
not
unmixed
with
truth
she
persuaded
him
that
he
was
the
man
destined
to
free
england
once
more
and
so
one
morning
he
set
out
alone
accompanied
only
by
martin
lightfoot
and
a
dozen
to
spy
out
the
land
and
see
what
might
be
done
within
a
week
he
landed
at
boston
only
to
find
that
bourne
his
home
had
been
bestowed
upon
the
cook
of
gilbert
of
ghent
and
that
at
that
moment
his
younger
brother
head
was
decorating
the
gable
of
the
hall
and
so
to
bourne
went
hereward
by
night
and
burst
in
upon
the
frenchmen
during
a
drunken
carouse
in
the
morning
there
were
fifteen
heads
upon
the
gable
to
replace
the
one
that
he
had
taken
down
overnight
forthwith
he
returned
to
flanders
having
bestowed
his
mother
in
safety
at
crowland
abbey
with
a
promise
to
his
countrymen
of
the
fens
that
he
would
return
to
aid
them
shortly
hereward
in
having
settled
his
affairs
in
flanders
in
due
time
he
landed
once
more
in
the
wash
with
torfrida
and
the
child
and
two
shiploads
of
stout
fighters
with
whom
he
went
through
fenland
raising
an
army
in
the
spring
came
sweyn
with
his
danes
all
eager
for
plunder
and
hereward
had
much
ado
to
prevent
them
from
plundering
crowland
abbey
only
succeeding
by
promising
them
a
richer
booty
in
peterborough
so
peterborough
they
took
and
sacked
but
at
peterborough
hereward
found
alftruda
who
had
left
her
husband
and
rescued
her
from
the
danes
during
the
sack
of
the
minster
and
looking
upon
her
extraordinary
beauty
for
the
second
time
he
forgot
torfrida
but
for
all
that
he
sent
her
for
safety
to
old
gilbert
of
ghent
who
had
thrown
in
his
lot
with
william
and
was
now
at
lincoln
having
done
with
peterborough
and
later
with
stamford
the
army
marched
to
ely
and
there
encamped
and
in
ely
a
great
council
was
held
after
which
sweyn
and
all
his
danes
returned
home
for
as
sweyn
truly
said
while
william
the
frenchman
is
king
by
the
sword
and
edgar
the
englishman
king
by
proclamation
of
earls
and
thanes
there
seems
no
room
here
for
sweyn
nephew
of
canute
king
of
kings
to
which
hereward
could
advance
no
good
reason
to
prove
that
there
was
anon
came
william
of
ely
and
built
a
floating
bridge
a
full
in
length
across
the
black
abyss
of
mud
and
reeds
that
yawned
between
the
island
and
the
mainland
but
the
bridge
was
unable
to
bear
the
weight
of
all
the
french
who
crowded
on
to
it
the
fastenings
at
the
broke
and
the
bridge
itself
overturned
so
that
all
upon
it
were
thrown
into
the
mud
and
miserably
drowned
whereon
william
withdrew
his
forces
to
brandon
for
a
space
and
hereward
being
minded
to
find
out
for
himself
what
next
was
purposed
against
the
island
followed
him
thither
with
shorn
hair
and
beard
and
disguised
as
a
travelling
potter
anon
he
came
to
william
palace
with
his
good
mare
swallow
bearing
on
her
back
a
load
of
crockery
at
the
palace
he
narrowly
escaped
recognition
being
sent
to
the
kitchen
where
he
got
into
a
quarrel
with
the
scullions
in
consequence
of
which
he
was
haled
before
william
himself
who
quickly
detected
that
he
was
other
than
he
pretended
look
you
said
william
you
are
no
common
churl
you
have
fought
too
well
for
that
show
me
your
arm
hereward
drew
up
his
sleeve
potters
do
not
carry
like
these
nor
are
they
tattooed
like
english
thanes
hold
up
thy
head
man
and
let
me
see
thy
throat
aha
so
i
suspected
there
is
fair
ladies
work
there
is
not
this
he
who
was
said
to
be
so
like
hereward
very
good
put
him
in
ward
till
i
come
back
from
hunting
but
do
him
no
harm
for
were
he
hereward
himself
i
should
be
right
glad
to
see
hereward
safe
and
sound
my
man
at
last
and
earl
of
all
between
humber
and
the
fens
whereupon
hereward
was
clapped
into
an
outhouse
whence
he
escaped
forthwith
by
the
simple
device
of
cutting
off
the
head
of
the
man
sent
to
fetter
him
and
the
good
mare
swallow
bore
him
back
to
ely
in
safety
a
little
later
william
came
again
to
ely
and
built
a
stronger
bridge
but
this
the
english
destroyed
by
fire
with
many
of
the
french
on
it
setting
the
reeds
aflame
on
the
windward
side
of
it
some
other
scheme
must
now
be
thought
out
and
the
one
that
pleased
william
most
was
to
send
to
the
monks
a
proclamation
that
unless
they
submitted
within
a
week
all
their
lands
and
manors
outside
the
island
would
be
confiscated
furthermore
that
if
hereward
would
submit
he
should
have
his
lands
in
bourne
and
a
free
pardon
for
himself
and
all
his
comrades
to
which
message
sir
ascelin
and
ivo
taillebois
not
being
over
desirous
of
having
hereward
as
a
neighbour
saw
fit
to
add
a
clause
exempting
torfrida
from
the
amnesty
but
that
she
should
be
burnt
on
account
of
her
abominable
and
notorious
sorceries
when
the
proclamation
arrived
hereward
was
away
foraging
he
came
back
in
hot
haste
when
he
heard
of
it
but
not
fast
enough
for
ere
they
were
in
sight
of
the
minster
tower
they
were
aware
of
a
horse
galloping
violently
towards
them
through
the
dusk
and
on
its
back
were
torfrida
and
her
daughter
the
monks
had
surrendered
the
island
rather
than
lose
their
lands
the
french
were
already
in
ely
and
now
is
hereward
to
the
greenwood
gone
to
be
a
bold
outlaw
and
the
father
of
all
outlaws
who
held
those
forests
for
two
hundred
years
from
the
fens
to
the
scottish
border
and
with
some
four
hundred
men
he
ranged
up
the
bruneswald
dashing
out
to
the
war
cry
of
a
wake
a
wake
and
laying
waste
with
fire
and
sword
that
is
such
towns
as
were
in
the
hands
of
frenchmen
now
hereward
had
been
faithful
to
torfrida
a
virtue
most
rare
in
those
days
and
he
loved
her
with
an
overwhelming
adoration
as
all
true
men
love
and
for
that
very
reason
he
was
the
more
aware
that
his
feeling
for
alftruda
was
strangely
like
his
feeling
for
torfrida
and
yet
strangely
different
wherefore
when
it
befell
that
once
on
a
day
there
came
riding
to
hereward
in
the
bruneswald
a
horseman
who
handed
to
him
a
letter
the
sight
of
alftruda
signature
at
the
end
sent
a
strange
thrill
through
him
there
was
naught
in
it
that
he
should
not
have
read
it
was
but
to
tell
him
that
the
french
were
upon
him
the
of
seven
counties
were
rising
and
so
forth
continuing
the
letter
told
him
that
dolfin
had
been
slain
on
the
border
and
william
and
gilbert
of
ghent
were
going
to
marry
her
to
ascelin
and
that
having
saved
her
twice
she
feared
that
hereward
could
not
save
her
a
third
time
concluding
with
an
entreaty
to
submit
to
william
hinting
that
an
opportunity
presented
itself
now
which
might
never
recur
the
messenger
took
back
the
answer
tell
your
lady
that
i
kiss
her
hands
and
feet
that
i
can
not
write
for
outlaws
carry
no
pen
or
ink
but
that
what
she
has
commanded
that
will
i
perform
having
showed
the
letter
to
torfrida
they
agreed
that
it
were
well
to
take
precautions
and
withdrew
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
alftruda
warning
was
both
timely
and
true
for
anon
came
ivo
taillebois
who
had
taken
to
wife
hereward
niece
lucia
and
abbot
thorold
of
peterborough
who
had
an
old
score
to
wipe
off
in
connection
with
hereward
last
visit
to
his
abbey
and
sir
ascelin
his
nephew
and
many
another
and
they
rode
gaily
through
the
greenwood
where
presently
they
found
hereward
to
their
sorrow
for
of
their
number
some
returned
home
only
after
payment
of
ransom
and
others
never
returned
at
all
and
of
the
former
were
abbot
thorold
and
ascelin
and
the
ransom
that
hereward
exacted
for
those
two
was
thirty
thousand
silver
marks
whereby
hereward
was
enabled
to
put
a
spoke
in
ascelin
wheel
eh
how
most
courteous
victor
said
sir
ascelin
sir
ascelin
is
not
a
very
wealthy
gentleman
ascelin
laughed
assent
intravi
nudus
england
and
i
fear
now
this
mortal
life
likewise
but
he
looked
to
his
rich
uncle
the
abbot
to
further
a
certain
marriage
project
of
his
and
of
course
neither
my
friend
gilbert
of
ghent
nor
my
enemy
william
of
normandy
are
likely
to
give
away
so
rich
an
heiress
without
some
gratification
in
return
the
last
of
the
thereafter
they
lived
for
two
years
in
the
forest
and
neither
torfrida
nor
hereward
was
the
better
for
them
hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick
and
a
sick
heart
is
but
too
apt
to
be
a
peevish
one
so
there
were
fits
of
despondency
jars
mutual
recriminations
furthermore
that
first
daughter
was
torfrida
only
child
and
she
knew
almost
as
well
as
he
how
hard
that
weighed
on
hereward
in
him
the
race
of
leofric
of
godiva
of
earl
oslac
would
become
extinct
and
the
girl
would
marry
whom
who
but
some
french
conqueror
or
at
best
some
english
outlaw
what
wonder
if
he
longed
for
a
son
to
pass
his
name
down
to
future
generations
and
one
day
martin
lightfoot
came
with
another
letter
to
hereward
which
he
delivered
to
torfrida
who
learned
from
him
that
it
came
from
alftruda
she
bade
him
deliver
it
to
hereward
to
whom
it
was
addressed
the
which
he
did
but
she
noticed
that
this
letter
hereward
never
mentioned
to
her
as
he
had
done
the
former
a
month
later
martin
came
again
there
is
another
letter
come
it
came
last
night
said
he
what
is
that
to
thee
or
me
my
lord
has
his
state
secrets
is
it
for
us
to
pry
into
them
go
i
thought
i
thought
go
i
say
there
was
a
noise
of
trampling
horses
outside
the
men
were
arming
and
saddling
and
hereward
went
with
them
saying
that
he
would
be
back
in
three
days
after
he
had
gone
she
found
close
to
where
his
armour
had
hung
a
letter
from
alftruda
it
congratulated
hereward
on
having
shaken
himself
free
from
the
fascinations
of
that
sorceress
it
said
that
all
was
settled
with
king
william
hereward
was
to
come
to
winchester
she
had
the
king
writ
for
his
safety
ready
to
send
to
him
the
king
would
receive
him
as
his
liegeman
alftruda
would
receive
him
as
her
husband
archbishop
lanfranc
had
made
difficulties
about
the
dissolution
of
his
marriage
with
torfrida
but
gold
would
do
all
things
at
rome
and
so
forth
when
this
was
read
after
a
night
of
frenzy
to
crowland
torfrida
went
under
the
guidance
of
martin
and
laid
her
head
upon
the
knees
of
the
lady
godiva
i
am
come
as
you
always
told
me
i
should
do
but
it
has
been
a
long
way
hither
and
i
am
very
tired
and
at
crowland
remained
martin
donning
a
lay
brother
frock
that
he
might
the
better
serve
his
mistress
and
to
crowland
after
three
days
came
leofric
the
renegade
priest
who
had
been
with
hereward
in
the
greenwood
and
with
him
the
child
and
so
it
came
that
when
hereward
returned
as
he
had
said
after
three
days
he
found
neither
wife
nor
child
and
to
crowland
he
too
went
but
came
away
even
as
he
had
gone
but
with
torfrida
he
had
no
word
nor
with
godiva
for
both
refused
him
audience
so
hereward
went
to
winchester
and
with
him
forty
of
his
knights
and
placed
his
hands
between
the
hands
of
william
and
swore
to
be
his
man
and
william
walked
out
of
the
hall
leaning
on
hereward
shoulder
at
which
all
the
normans
gnashed
their
teeth
with
envy
and
thereafter
hereward
married
alftruda
after
the
scruples
of
holy
church
had
been
duly
set
at
rest
then
hereward
lived
again
at
bourne
and
tried
to
bring
forgetfulness
by
drink
and
drink
brought
boastfulness
for
that
he
had
no
more
the
spirit
left
to
do
great
deeds
he
must
needs
babble
of
the
great
deeds
which
he
had
done
and
hurl
insult
and
defiance
at
his
norman
neighbours
and
in
the
space
of
three
years
he
had
become
as
intolerable
to
those
same
neighbours
as
they
were
intolerable
to
him
and
he
was
fain
to
keep
up
at
bourne
the
same
watch
and
ward
that
he
had
kept
up
in
the
forest
and
judith
came
to
bourne
and
besought
alftruda
to
accompany
her
to
crowland
where
she
would
visit
the
tomb
of
waltheof
her
husband
and
alftruda
went
with
her
taking
a
goodly
company
of
knights
to
be
her
escort
while
hereward
remained
at
bourne
with
few
to
guard
it
and
knowing
this
to
bourne
came
ascelin
and
taillebois
evermue
raoul
de
dol
and
many
another
norman
and
burst
in
upon
hereward
in
some
such
fashion
as
he
had
done
himself
some
ten
years
earlier
felons
he
shouted
your
king
has
given
me
his
truce
is
this
your
french
law
is
this
your
french
honour
come
on
traitors
all
and
get
what
you
can
of
a
naked
man
you
will
buy
it
dear
guard
my
back
winter
and
with
his
constant
comrade
at
his
back
he
dashed
right
at
the
press
of
knights
and
when
his
lance
did
break
in
hand
full
fell
enough
he
smote
with
brand
and
now
he
is
all
wounded
and
winter
who
fought
at
his
back
is
fallen
on
his
face
and
hereward
stands
alone
within
a
ring
of
eleven
corpses
a
knight
rushes
in
to
make
a
twelfth
cloven
through
the
helm
but
with
the
blow
hereward
blade
snaps
short
and
he
hurls
it
away
as
his
foes
rush
in
with
his
shield
he
beat
out
the
brains
of
two
but
now
taillebois
and
evermue
are
behind
him
and
with
four
lances
through
his
back
he
falls
to
rise
no
more
so
perished
the
last
of
the
english
hypatia
in
hypatia
published
in
after
passing
through
fraser
magazine
kingsley
turned
from
social
problems
in
england
to
life
in
egypt
in
the
fifth
century
taking
the
same
pains
to
give
the
historical
facts
of
the
old
dying
roman
world
as
he
did
to
describe
contemporary
events
at
home
the
moral
of
hypatia
according
to
its
author
is
that
the
sins
of
these
old
egyptians
are
yours
their
errors
yours
their
doom
yours
their
deliverance
yours
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
the
in
the
year
of
the
christian
era
some
miles
from
alexandria
the
young
monk
philammon
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
low
range
of
inland
cliffs
crested
with
drifting
sand
behind
him
the
desert
sand
waste
stretched
lifeless
interminable
reflecting
its
lurid
blare
on
the
horizon
of
the
cloudless
vault
of
blue
presently
he
rose
and
wandered
along
the
cliffs
in
search
of
fuel
for
the
monastery
from
whence
he
came
for
abbot
pambo
laura
at
scetis
it
lay
pleasantly
enough
that
lonely
laura
or
lane
of
rude
cyclopean
cells
under
the
perpetual
shadow
of
the
southern
walls
of
crags
amid
its
grove
of
ancient
and
a
simple
happy
gentle
life
was
that
of
the
laura
all
portioned
out
by
rules
and
methods
each
man
had
food
and
raiment
shelter
on
earth
friends
and
counsellors
living
trust
in
the
continual
care
of
almighty
god
thither
had
they
fled
out
of
cities
out
of
a
rotten
dying
world
of
tyrants
and
slaves
hypocrites
and
wantons
to
ponder
undisturbed
on
duty
and
on
judgment
on
death
and
eternity
but
to
philammon
had
come
an
insatiable
craving
to
know
the
mysteries
of
learning
to
see
the
great
roaring
world
of
men
he
felt
he
could
stay
no
longer
and
on
his
return
he
poured
out
his
speech
to
abbot
pambo
let
me
go
i
am
not
discontented
with
you
but
with
myself
i
knew
that
obedience
is
noble
but
danger
is
nobler
still
if
you
have
seen
the
world
why
should
not
i
cyril
and
his
clergy
have
not
fled
from
it
abbot
pambo
sought
counsel
with
the
good
brother
aufugus
and
then
bade
philammon
follow
him
and
thou
wouldst
see
the
world
poor
fool
thou
wouldst
see
the
world
said
the
old
man
when
the
abbot
had
left
them
alone
together
i
would
convert
the
world
thou
must
know
it
first
here
i
sit
the
poor
unknown
old
monk
until
i
die
and
shall
i
tell
thee
what
that
world
is
like
i
was
arsenius
tutor
of
the
emperor
there
at
byzantium
i
saw
the
world
which
thou
wouldst
see
and
what
i
saw
thou
wilt
see
bishops
kissing
the
feet
of
parricides
saints
tearing
saints
in
pieces
for
a
word
falsehood
and
selfishness
spite
and
lust
confusion
seven
times
confounded
and
thou
wouldst
go
into
the
world
from
which
i
fled
if
the
harvest
be
at
hand
the
lord
needs
labourers
send
me
and
let
that
day
find
me
where
i
long
to
be
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
of
the
lord
the
lord
voice
be
obeyed
thou
shalt
go
here
are
letters
to
cyril
the
patriarch
thou
goest
of
our
free
will
as
well
as
thine
own
the
abbot
and
i
have
watched
thee
long
knowing
that
the
lord
had
need
of
such
as
thee
elsewhere
we
did
but
prove
thee
to
see
by
thy
readiness
to
obey
whether
thou
were
fit
to
rule
go
and
god
be
with
thee
covet
no
man
gold
or
silver
neither
eat
flesh
nor
drink
wine
but
live
as
thou
hast
lived
a
nazarite
of
the
lord
the
papyrus
boat
lies
at
the
ferry
thou
shalt
descend
in
it
when
thou
hast
gone
five
days
journey
downward
ask
for
the
mouth
of
the
canal
of
alexandria
once
in
the
city
any
monk
will
guide
thee
to
the
archbishop
send
us
news
of
thy
welfare
by
some
holy
mouth
come
silently
they
paced
together
down
the
glen
to
the
lonely
beach
of
the
great
stream
pambo
was
there
and
with
slow
and
feeble
arms
he
launched
the
canoe
philammon
flung
himself
at
the
old
men
feet
and
besought
their
blessing
and
their
forgiveness
we
have
nothing
to
forgive
follow
thou
thine
inward
call
if
it
be
the
flesh
it
will
avenge
itself
if
it
be
of
the
spirit
who
are
we
that
we
should
fight
against
god
farewell
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
youth
and
his
canoe
were
lessening
down
the
rapid
stream
in
the
golden
summer
twilight
hypatia
queen
of
on
his
first
morning
in
alexandria
philammon
heard
praises
of
hypatia
from
a
fruit
porter
who
showed
him
the
way
to
the
archbishop
house
hypatia
according
to
his
guide
was
the
queen
of
alexandria
a
very
unique
and
wonderful
person
the
fountain
of
classic
wisdom
later
in
the
day
after
he
had
presented
himself
to
archbishop
cyril
philammon
learnt
from
an
old
priest
and
from
a
fanatical
monk
named
peter
that
the
very
name
of
hypatia
was
enough
to
rouse
the
clergy
to
a
fury
of
execration
it
seemed
that
orestes
the
roman
governor
of
the
city
although
nominally
a
christian
was
the
curse
of
the
alexandrian
church
and
orestes
visited
hypatia
whose
lectures
on
heathen
philosophy
drew
all
the
educated
youth
of
the
place
philammon
heart
burned
to
distinguish
himself
at
once
there
were
no
idols
now
to
break
but
there
was
philosophy
why
does
not
some
man
of
god
go
boldly
into
the
of
the
sorceress
and
testify
against
her
he
asked
do
it
yourself
if
you
dare
said
peter
we
have
no
wish
to
get
our
brains
knocked
out
by
all
the
profligate
young
gentlemen
in
the
city
i
will
do
it
said
philammon
the
archbishop
gave
permission
only
promise
me
two
things
he
said
promise
me
that
whatever
happens
you
will
not
strike
the
first
blow
and
that
you
will
not
argue
with
her
contradict
denounce
defy
but
give
no
reasons
if
you
do
you
are
lost
she
is
subtler
than
the
serpent
skilled
in
all
the
tricks
of
logic
and
you
will
became
a
and
run
away
in
shame
ay
said
peter
bitterly
as
he
ushered
philammon
out
go
up
to
ramoth
gilead
and
prosper
young
fool
ay
go
and
let
her
convert
you
touch
the
accursed
thing
like
achan
and
see
if
you
do
not
end
by
having
it
in
your
tent
and
with
this
encouraging
sentence
the
two
parted
and
philammon
on
the
following
morning
followed
the
train
of
philosophers
students
and
fine
gentlemen
to
hypatia
philammon
listened
to
hypatia
in
bewilderment
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
the
speaker
the
melody
of
her
voice
and
the
glitter
of
her
rhetoric
as
she
discoursed
on
truth
a
sea
of
new
thoughts
and
questions
came
rushing
in
on
his
acute
greek
intellect
at
every
sentence
a
hostile
allusion
to
the
christian
scriptures
aroused
him
and
he
cried
out
it
is
false
blasphemous
the
scriptures
can
not
lie
there
was
a
yell
at
this
turn
the
monk
out
throw
the
rustic
through
the
window
cried
a
dozen
young
gentlemen
several
of
the
most
valiant
began
to
scramble
over
the
benches
up
to
him
and
philammon
was
congratulating
himself
on
the
near
approach
of
a
glorious
martyrdom
when
hypatia
voice
calm
and
silvery
stifled
the
noise
and
tumult
in
a
moment
let
the
youth
listen
gentlemen
he
is
but
a
monk
and
a
plebeian
and
knows
no
better
he
has
been
taught
thus
let
him
sit
here
quietly
and
perhaps
we
may
be
able
to
teach
him
otherwise
and
without
even
a
change
of
tone
she
continued
her
lecture
philammon
sprang
up
the
moment
that
the
spell
of
her
voice
was
taken
off
him
and
hurried
out
through
the
corridor
into
the
street
but
he
had
not
gone
fifty
yards
before
his
friend
the
fruit
porter
breathless
with
running
told
him
that
hypatia
called
for
him
thereon
her
father
commands
thee
to
be
at
her
house
here
at
the
third
hour
hear
and
obey
cyril
heard
philammon
story
and
hypatia
message
with
a
quiet
smile
and
then
dismissed
the
youth
to
an
afternoon
of
labour
in
the
city
commanding
him
to
come
for
his
order
in
the
evening
but
in
the
evening
peter
already
jealous
of
cyril
interest
in
philammon
and
enraged
at
any
toleration
being
extended
to
hypatia
refused
to
let
the
youth
enter
the
archbishop
house
and
then
struck
him
full
in
the
face
the
blow
was
intolerable
and
in
an
instant
peter
long
legs
were
sprawling
on
the
pavement
while
he
bellowed
like
a
bull
to
all
the
monks
that
stood
by
seize
him
the
traitor
the
heretic
he
holds
communion
with
heathens
and
he
was
in
this
morning
a
rush
took
place
at
the
youth
but
philammon
blood
was
up
the
ring
of
monks
were
baying
at
him
like
hounds
round
a
bear
and
against
such
odds
the
struggle
would
be
desperate
he
turned
and
forced
his
way
to
the
gate
amid
a
yell
of
derision
which
brought
every
drop
of
blood
in
his
body
into
his
cheeks
let
me
leave
this
court
in
safety
god
knows
whether
i
am
a
heretic
and
the
archbishop
shall
know
of
your
iniquity
i
will
not
cross
this
threshold
again
until
cyril
himself
sends
for
me
to
shame
you
he
strode
on
in
his
wrath
some
hundred
yards
or
more
before
he
asked
himself
where
he
was
going
gradually
one
fixed
idea
began
to
glimmer
through
the
storm
to
see
hypatia
and
convert
her
he
had
cyril
leave
it
must
be
right
that
would
justify
him
to
bring
back
in
the
fetters
of
the
gospel
the
queen
of
heathendom
yes
there
was
that
left
to
live
for
philammon
did
not
convert
hypatia
but
he
became
her
favourite
pupil
and
hypatia
dreaming
that
the
worship
of
the
old
gods
might
be
restored
and
her
philosophy
triumph
over
christianity
received
daily
visits
from
orestes
the
governor
and
entered
into
his
plans
to
her
undoing
for
orestes
had
an
idea
of
becoming
emperor
and
of
purchasing
the
favour
of
the
populace
by
a
show
of
gladiators
to
win
hypatia
for
himself
he
promised
to
restore
the
heathen
games
and
hypatia
caring
nothing
for
orestes
but
always
longing
for
the
revival
of
the
old
religion
promised
against
her
better
judgment
to
bear
him
company
on
the
day
of
the
festival
and
to
sit
by
his
side
and
even
to
acclaim
him
emperor
the
success
of
orestes
plot
depended
on
the
success
of
a
bigger
rebellion
the
attempt
of
heraclian
count
of
africa
to
conquer
rome
heraclian
had
been
defeated
and
this
was
known
to
cyril
but
orestes
was
misled
by
false
intelligence
and
counted
on
heraclian
victory
for
his
own
triumph
when
the
day
of
the
spectacle
arrived
to
the
horror
and
surprise
of
philammon
hypatia
herself
sat
by
the
side
of
the
roman
prefect
while
on
the
stage
before
them
a
number
of
libyan
prisoners
fought
fiercely
for
their
lives
only
to
be
butchered
in
the
end
by
the
professional
gladiators
the
sleeping
devil
in
the
hearts
of
the
brutalised
multitude
burst
forth
at
the
sight
and
with
jeers
and
applause
the
hired
ruffians
were
urged
on
to
their
work
of
blood
then
a
shameless
exhibition
of
venus
followed
and
philammon
could
bear
no
more
for
venus
was
his
sister
long
parted
from
him
in
childhood
and
only
in
the
last
few
days
had
he
learnt
of
his
relationship
to
pelagia
the
lady
who
had
consented
to
act
the
part
of
the
goddess
of
love
and
who
was
betrothed
to
amal
the
leader
of
the
band
of
goths
he
rushed
down
through
the
dense
mass
of
spectators
leaped
the
balustrade
into
the
orchestra
below
and
tore
across
to
the
foot
of
the
stage
pelagia
sister
my
sister
have
mercy
on
me
on
yourself
i
will
hide
you
save
you
we
will
flee
together
out
of
this
infernal
place
i
am
your
brother
come
she
looked
at
him
one
moment
with
wide
wild
eyes
the
truth
flashed
on
her
and
she
sprang
from
the
platform
into
his
arms
and
then
covering
her
face
with
both
her
hands
sank
down
among
the
bloodstained
sand
a
yell
ran
along
the
vast
circle
philammon
was
hurried
away
by
the
attendants
and
pelagia
her
face
still
hidden
by
her
hands
walked
slowly
away
and
vanished
among
the
palms
at
the
back
of
the
stage
a
cloud
whether
of
disgust
or
disappointment
now
hung
upon
every
brow
and
there
was
open
murmuring
at
the
cruelty
and
heathenry
of
the
show
hypatia
was
utterly
unnerved
orestes
alone
rose
to
the
crisis
in
a
oration
he
declared
that
heraclian
the
african
was
conquerer
of
rome
and
a
roar
of
hired
applause
supported
him
then
the
prefect
of
the
guards
encouraged
the
city
authorities
to
salute
orestes
as
emperor
and
hypatia
amid
shouts
of
her
aristocratic
scholars
rose
and
knelt
before
him
writhing
inwardly
with
shame
and
despair
at
the
same
moment
a
monk
voice
shouted
from
the
highest
tiers
in
the
theatre
it
is
false
false
you
are
tricked
heraclian
was
utterly
routed
cyril
has
known
it
every
jew
has
known
it
for
a
week
past
so
perish
all
the
enemies
of
the
lord
caught
in
their
own
snare
for
a
minute
an
awful
silence
fell
on
all
who
heard
and
then
arose
a
tumult
which
orestes
in
vain
attempted
to
subdue
the
emperor
summoned
his
guards
around
him
and
hypatia
and
made
his
way
out
as
best
he
could
while
the
multitude
melted
away
like
snow
before
the
rain
to
find
every
church
placarded
by
cyril
with
the
particulars
of
ruin
two
days
later
when
hypatia
went
to
give
her
farewell
lecture
to
her
pupils
for
all
hope
was
dead
a
mob
of
monks
and
their
followers
seized
her
dragged
her
into
the
church
of
the
caesareum
and
there
before
the
great
still
figure
of
christ
peter
struck
her
down
and
the
mob
tore
her
limb
from
limb
back
to
the
philammon
had
done
his
best
struggling
in
vain
to
pierce
the
dense
mass
of
people
and
save
hypatia
he
had
been
wedged
against
a
pillar
unable
to
move
in
the
great
church
the
little
fruit
porter
alone
of
all
her
disciples
fought
his
way
through
the
mob
only
to
be
thrown
down
the
steps
when
all
was
over
in
the
church
and
hypatia
was
dead
and
the
mob
had
rushed
out
philammon
sank
down
exhausted
outside
and
the
little
porter
burst
out
into
a
bitter
agony
of
human
tears
she
is
with
the
gods
said
the
porter
at
last
she
is
with
the
god
of
gods
answered
philammon
then
he
felt
that
he
must
arise
and
flee
for
his
life
he
had
gone
forth
to
see
the
world
and
he
had
seen
it
arsenius
was
in
the
right
after
all
home
to
the
desert
but
first
he
would
go
himself
alone
and
find
pelagia
and
implore
her
to
flee
with
him
abbot
pambo
as
well
as
arsenius
had
been
dead
several
years
the
abbot
place
was
filled
by
his
own
dying
command
by
a
hermit
from
the
neighbouring
deserts
who
had
made
himself
famous
for
many
miles
round
by
his
extraordinary
austerities
his
ceaseless
prayers
and
his
loving
wisdom
while
still
in
the
prime
of
his
manhood
he
was
dragged
against
his
own
entreaties
to
preside
over
the
laura
of
scetis
the
elder
monks
considered
it
an
indignity
to
be
ruled
by
so
young
a
man
but
the
monastery
throve
and
grew
rapidly
under
his
government
his
sweetness
patience
and
humility
and
above
all
his
marvellous
understanding
of
the
doubts
and
temptations
of
his
own
generation
soon
drew
around
him
all
whose
sensitiveness
or
waywardness
had
made
them
unmanageable
in
the
neighbouring
monasteries
never
was
the
young
abbot
philammon
heard
to
speak
harshly
of
any
human
being
and
he
stopped
by
stern
rebuke
any
attempt
to
revile
either
heretics
or
heathens
one
thing
was
noted
that
there
mingled
always
with
his
prayers
the
names
of
two
women
and
when
some
worthy
elder
taking
courage
from
his
years
dared
to
hint
kindly
that
this
caused
some
scandal
to
the
weaker
brethren
it
is
true
answered
he
tell
my
brethren
that
i
pray
nightly
for
two
women
both
of
them
young
both
of
them
beautiful
both
of
them
beloved
by
me
more
than
i
love
my
own
soul
and
tell
them
that
one
of
the
two
was
an
actress
and
the
other
a
heathen
the
old
monk
laid
his
hand
on
his
mouth
and
retired
the
remainder
of
his
history
it
seems
better
to
extract
from
an
unpublished
fragment
of
the
lives
of
the
saints
now
when
the
said
abbot
had
ruled
the
monastery
of
scetis
seven
years
with
uncommon
prudence
he
called
one
morning
to
him
a
certain
ancient
brother
and
said
ready
for
me
the
divine
elements
that
i
may
consecrate
them
and
partake
thereof
with
all
my
brethren
ere
i
depart
hence
for
know
assuredly
that
within
the
seventh
day
i
shall
migrate
to
the
celestial
mansions
and
the
abbot
having
consecrated
distributed
among
his
brethren
reserving
only
a
portion
of
the
most
holy
bread
and
wine
and
then
having
bestowed
on
them
all
the
kiss
of
peace
he
took
the
paten
and
chalice
in
his
hands
and
went
forth
from
the
monastery
towards
the
desert
whom
the
whole
fraternity
followed
weeping
and
having
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
certain
mountain
he
stopped
and
blessing
them
dismissed
them
and
so
ascending
was
taken
away
from
their
eyes
but
the
eldest
brother
sent
two
of
the
young
men
to
seek
their
master
who
meeting
with
a
certain
moorish
people
learnt
that
a
priest
bearing
a
paten
and
chalice
had
passed
before
them
a
few
days
before
crossing
the
desert
in
the
direction
of
the
cave
of
the
holy
amma
and
they
inquiring
who
this
amma
might
be
the
moors
answered
that
some
twenty
years
ago
there
had
arrived
in
those
mountains
a
woman
more
beautiful
than
had
ever
before
been
seen
in
that
region
who
after
distributing
among
them
the
rich
jewels
which
she
wore
had
embraced
the
hermit
life
and
sojourned
upon
the
highest
peak
of
a
neighbouring
mountain
then
the
two
brothers
determining
to
proceed
arrived
upon
the
summit
of
the
said
mountain
there
in
an
open
grave
guarded
by
two
lions
lay
the
body
of
philammon
the
abbot
and
by
his
side
wrapped
in
his
cloak
the
corpse
of
a
woman
of
exceeding
beauty
such
as
the
moors
had
described
and
by
the
stood
the
paten
and
the
chalice
emptied
of
their
divine
contents
whereupon
filling
in
the
grave
with
all
haste
they
returned
weeping
to
the
laura
now
before
they
returned
one
of
the
brethren
searching
the
cave
wherein
the
holy
woman
dwelt
found
nothing
there
saving
one
bracelet
of
gold
of
large
size
and
strange
workmanship
engraven
with
foreign
characters
which
no
one
could
decipher
and
it
came
to
pass
years
afterwards
that
certain
wandering
barbarians
of
the
vandalic
race
saw
this
bracelet
in
the
laura
of
scetis
and
pretended
that
it
had
belonged
to
a
warrior
of
their
tribe
so
be
it
pelagia
and
philammon
like
the
rest
went
to
their
own
place
to
the
only
place
where
such
in
such
days
could
find
rest
to
the
desert
and
the
hermit
cell
let
him
that
is
without
sin
among
you
cast
the
first
stone
whether
at
hypatia
or
pelagia
cyril
or
philammon

kingsley
two
years
ago
has
been
said
by
his
son
to
be
the
only
novel
pure
and
simple
that
ever
came
from
the
pen
of
the
famous
writer
published
in
it
was
begun
two
years
earlier
while
staying
at
bideford
at
this
time
kingsley
was
deeply
interested
in
the
crimean
war
and
many
thousands
of
copies
of
his
pamphlet
brave
words
to
brave
soldiers
were
distributed
to
the
army
his
military
tastes
no
doubt
go
a
long
way
towards
explaining
his
doctrine
in
two
years
ago
that
the
war
was
to
exercise
a
great
regenerating
influence
in
english
life
although
the
story
is
in
many
respects
weaker
than
its
predecessors
it
nevertheless
abounds
in
brilliant
and
vivid
the
descriptions
of
north
devon
scenery
being
probably
unsurpassed
in
english
prose
tom
thurnall
to
tell
my
story
i
must
go
back
sixteen
years
to
the
days
when
the
pleasant
old
town
of
whitbury
boasted
of
forty
coaches
a
day
instead
of
one
railway
and
set
forth
how
there
stood
two
pleasant
houses
side
by
side
in
its
southern
suburb
in
one
of
these
two
houses
lived
mark
armsworth
banker
solicitor
land
agent
and
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
other
lived
edward
thurnall
esquire
doctor
of
medicine
and
consulting
physician
of
all
the
countryside
these
two
men
were
as
brothers
both
were
honest
and
men
thurnall
was
sitting
in
his
study
settled
to
his
microscope
one
beautiful
october
morning
and
his
son
tom
stood
gazing
out
of
the
bay
window
tom
who
had
been
brought
up
in
his
father
profession
was
of
that
type
so
common
in
england
sturdy
his
face
full
of
shrewdness
and
good
nature
and
of
humour
withal
it
was
his
last
day
at
home
tomorrow
he
was
leaving
for
paris
presently
mark
armsworth
came
in
and
tom
was
seen
cantering
about
the
garden
with
a
weakly
child
of
eight
in
his
arms
mark
the
boy
heart
can
not
be
in
the
wrong
place
while
he
is
so
fond
of
little
children
if
she
grows
up
doctor
and
do
go
to
join
her
poor
dear
mother
up
there
i
do
know
that
i
wish
her
a
better
husband
than
your
boy
it
would
be
a
poor
enough
match
for
her
tut
she
have
the
money
and
he
the
brains
doctor
that
boy
be
a
credit
to
you
he
make
a
noise
in
the
world
or
i
know
nothing
and
if
his
fancy
holds
seven
years
hence
and
he
wants
still
to
turn
traveller
let
him
if
he
minded
to
go
round
the
world
i
back
him
to
go
somehow
or
i
eat
my
head
ned
thurnall
so
tom
carried
mary
about
all
the
morning
and
next
day
went
to
paris
and
soon
became
the
best
pistol
shot
and
in
the
quartier
latin
then
he
went
to
mumpsimus
hospital
in
london
and
became
the
best
boxer
therein
and
captain
of
the
besides
winning
prizes
and
certificates
without
end
and
becoming
in
time
the
most
popular
in
the
hospital
but
nothing
could
keep
him
permanently
at
home
settle
down
in
a
country
practice
he
would
not
cost
his
father
a
farthing
he
would
not
so
he
started
forth
into
the
wide
world
with
nothing
but
his
wits
and
his
science
an
anatomical
professor
to
a
new
college
in
some
south
american
republic
unfortunately
when
he
got
there
he
found
that
the
annual
revolution
had
just
taken
place
and
that
the
party
who
had
founded
the
college
had
all
been
shot
whereat
he
whistled
and
started
off
again
no
man
knew
whither
having
got
round
half
the
world
daddy
he
wrote
home
it
hard
if
i
do
get
round
the
other
half
with
which
he
vanished
into
infinite
space
and
was
only
heard
of
by
occasional
letters
dated
from
the
rocky
mountains
the
spanish
west
indies
otaheite
singapore
the
falkland
islands
and
all
manner
of
unexpected
places
sending
home
valuable
notes
zoological
and
botanical
at
last
when
full
four
years
were
passed
and
gone
since
tom
started
for
south
america
he
descended
from
the
box
of
the
at
whitbury
with
a
serene
and
healthful
countenance
shouldered
his
and
started
for
his
father
house
he
walked
in
and
hung
up
his
hat
in
the
hall
just
as
if
he
had
come
in
from
a
walk
not
finding
the
old
man
he
went
into
mark
armsworth
frightening
out
of
her
wits
a
pale
ugly
girl
of
seventeen
whom
he
discovered
to
be
his
old
playfellow
mary
however
she
soon
recovered
her
equanimity
and
longed
to
throw
her
arms
round
his
neck
as
of
old
and
was
only
restrained
by
the
thought
that
she
was
grown
a
great
girl
now
she
called
her
father
and
all
the
household
and
after
a
while
the
old
doctor
came
home
and
the
fatted
calf
was
killed
and
all
made
merry
over
the
return
of
this
altogether
unrepentant
prodigal
son
tom
thurnall
stayed
a
month
at
home
and
then
went
to
america
whence
he
wrote
home
in
about
six
months
then
came
a
long
silence
and
then
a
letter
from
california
and
then
letters
more
regularly
from
australia
sickened
with
california
life
he
had
crossed
the
pacific
once
more
and
was
hard
at
work
in
the
diggings
doctoring
and
by
turns
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
said
his
father
he
has
the
pluck
of
a
hound
and
the
cunning
of
a
fox
said
mark
and
he
be
a
credit
to
you
yet
so
the
years
slipped
on
till
the
autumn
of
and
then
tom
at
the
diggings
at
ballarat
got
a
letter
from
mary
armsworth
your
father
is
quite
well
in
health
but
his
eyes
have
grown
much
worse
and
the
doctors
are
afraid
that
he
has
little
chance
of
recovering
the
sight
at
least
of
the
left
eye
and
something
has
happened
to
the
railroad
in
which
he
had
invested
so
much
and
he
has
given
up
the
old
house
he
wants
you
to
come
home
but
my
father
has
entreated
him
to
let
you
stay
you
know
while
we
are
here
he
is
safe
tom
walked
away
slowly
into
the
forest
he
felt
that
the
crisis
of
his
life
was
come
i
stay
here
and
work
he
said
to
himself
finally
till
i
make
a
hit
or
luck
runs
dry
and
then
home
and
settle
and
meanwhile
i
go
down
to
melbourne
tomorrow
and
send
the
dear
old
dad
two
hundred
pounds
and
there
sprang
up
in
him
at
once
the
intensest
yearning
after
his
father
and
the
haunts
of
his
boyhood
and
the
wildest
dread
that
he
should
never
see
them
the
half
the
village
of
aberalva
is
collected
on
the
long
sloping
point
of
a
cliff
sailors
wrapped
in
coast
guardsmen
women
with
their
gowns
turned
over
their
heads
while
every
moment
some
fresh
comer
stumbles
down
the
slope
and
asks
where
the
wreck
a
shift
of
wind
a
drift
of
cloud
and
the
moon
flashes
out
a
moment
there
she
is
sir
says
brown
the
to
the
coastguard
lieutenant
some
three
hundred
yards
out
at
sea
lies
a
long
curved
black
line
amid
the
white
wild
leaping
hills
of
water
a
murmur
from
the
crowd
a
liverpool
clipper
by
the
lines
of
her
god

the
poor
passengers
then
sobs
a
woman
they
past

help
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passes

shouts
brown
she
going
the
black
curve
coils
up
and
then
all
melts
away
into
the
white
seething
waste
the
coastguard
lieutenant
settles
down
in
his
macintoshes
knowing
that
his
duty
is
not
to
leave
as
long
as
there
is
a
chance
of
saving
not
a
life
for
that
was
past
all
hope
but
a
chest
of
clothes
or
a
stick
of
timber
and
with
the
coastguardsmen
many
sailors
stayed
old
captain
willis
stays
because
grace
harvey
the
village
schoolmistress
is
there
sitting
upon
a
flat
slope
of
rock
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
with
her
face
resting
on
her
hands
gazing
intently
out
into
the
wild
waste
she
not
one
of
us
says
old
willis
there
no
saying
what
going
on
there
in
her
maybe
she
praying
maybe
she
sees
more
than
we
do
over
the
sea
there
look
at
her
now
what
she
after
brown
replies
the
girl
had
raised
her
head
and
was
pointing
toward
the
sea
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
scream
a
man
a
man
save
him
as
she
spoke
a
huge
wave
rolled
in
and
out
of
it
struggled
on
hands
and
knees
a
human
figure
he
looked
wildly
up
and
around
and
lay
clinging
with
outstretched
arms
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
save
him
she
shrieked
again
as
twenty
men
rushed
forward
and
stopped
short
the
man
was
fully
thirty
yards
from
them
but
between
them
and
him
stretched
a
long
ghastly
crack
some
ten
feet
wide
with
seething
cauldrons
within
ere
they
could
nerve
themselves
for
action
the
wave
had
come
the
wretched
mariner
and
tearing
across
the
chasm
the
schoolmistress
took
one
long
look
and
as
the
wave
retired
rushed
after
it
to
the
very
brink
of
the
chasm
and
flung
herself
on
her
knees
the
wave
has
carried
him
across
the
crack
and
she
got
him
screamed
old
willis
and
he
sprang
upon
her
and
caught
her
round
the
waist
now
if
you
be
men
shouted
he
as
the
rest
hurried
down
now
if
you
be
men
before
the
next
wave
comes
shouted
big
jan
the
fisherman
hands
together
and
make
a
line
and
he
took
a
grip
with
one
hand
of
the
old
man
waistband
and
held
out
the
other
for
who
would
to
seize
strong
hand
after
hand
was
clasped
and
strong
knee
after
knee
dropped
almost
to
the
rock
to
meet
the
coming
rush
of
water
it
came
and
surged
over
the
man
and
the
girl
and
up
to
old
throat
and
round
the
knees
of
jan
and
his
neighbour
and
then
followed
the
returning
and
every
limb
quivered
under
the
strain
but
when
the
cataract
had
disappeared
the
chain
was
still
unbroken
saved
and
a
cheer
broke
from
all
lips
save
those
of
the
girl
herself
she
was
as
senseless
as
he
whom
she
had
saved
gently
they
lifted
each
and
laid
them
on
the
rock
and
presently
the
schoolmistress
was
safe
in
bed
at
her
mother
house
and
the
man
weak
but
alive
had
been
carried
triumphantly
up
to
the
door
of
heale
which
having
been
kicked
open
the
sailors
insisted
on
carrying
him
right
upstairs
and
depositing
him
on
the
best
spare
bed
saying
if
you
wo
come
to
your
patients
doctor
your
patients
shall
come
to
you
the
man
grumbled
when
he
awoke
next
morning
at
being
thrown
ashore
with
nothing
in
the
world
but
an
old
jersey
and
a
bag
of
tobacco
two
hundred
miles
short
of
the
port
where
he
hoped
to
land
with
in
his
pocket
to
heale
and
to
the
rev
frank
headley
the
curate
who
called
upon
him
he
mentioned
that
his
name
was
tom
thurnall
later
in
the
day
tom
met
the
coastguard
lieutenant
and
old
captain
willis
on
the
shore
and
the
latter
introduced
him
to
miss
harvey
the
young
person
who
saved
your
life
last
night
tom
was
struck
by
the
beauty
of
the
girl
at
once
but
after
thanking
her
said
gently
i
wish
to
tell
you
something
which
i
do
not
want
publicly
talked
of
but
in
which
you
may
help
me
i
had
nearly
about
me
when
i
came
ashore
last
night
sewed
in
a
belt
round
my
waist
it
is
gone
grace
turned
pale
and
her
lips
quivered
she
turned
to
her
mother
and
captain
willis
belt
mother
uncle
what
is
this
the
gentleman
has
lost
a
belt
dear
me
a
belt
well
child
that
not
much
to
grieve
over
when
the
lord
has
spared
his
life
said
her
mother
somewhat
testily
grace
declared
the
money
should
be
found
and
tom
vowed
to
himself
he
would
stay
in
that
little
cornish
village
of
aberalva
until
he
had
recovered
it
so
after
writing
to
some
old
friends
at
mumpsimus
hospital
to
send
him
down
some
new
drugs
and
to
his
father
he
settled
down
as
heale
assistant
and
heale
being
addicted
to
brandy
and
water
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
assistance
the
tom
thurnall
had
made
up
his
mind
in
june
that
the
cholera
ought
to
visit
aberalva
in
the
course
of
the
summer
and
of
course
tried
his
best
to
persuade
people
to
get
ready
for
their
ugly
visitor
but
in
vain
the
collective
ignorance
pride
laziness
and
superstition
of
the
little
town
showed
a
terrible
front
to
the
newcomer
does
he
think
we
was
all
fools
afore
he
came
here
that
was
the
rallying
cry
of
the
enemy
and
sanitary
reform
was
thrust
out
of
sight
but
lord
minchampstead
who
owned
the
neighbouring
estates
of
pentremochyn
on
mark
armsworth
advice
got
tom
to
make
a
report
on
the
sanitary
state
of
his
cottages
and
then
acted
on
the
information
frank
headley
backed
up
tom
in
his
sanitary
crusade
the
coastguard
lieutenant
proved
an
unexpected
ally
and
grace
harvey
promised
that
she
would
do
all
she
could
tom
wrote
up
to
london
and
detailed
the
condition
of
the
place
to
the
general
board
of
health
and
the
board
returned
for
answer
that
as
soon
as
cholera
broke
out
in
aberalva
they
would
send
down
an
inspector
then
in
august
it
came
and
tom
beer
the
fisherman
and
one
of
the
finest
fellows
in
the
town
was
dead
after
two
hours
illness
up
and
down
the
town
the
foul
fiend
sported
now
here
now
there
fleshing
his
teeth
on
every
kind
of
prey
he
has
taken
old
beer
second
son
and
now
clutches
at
the
old
man
himself
then
across
the
street
to
jan
beer
his
eldest
but
he
is
driven
out
from
both
houses
by
chloride
of
lime
and
the
colony
of
the
beers
has
peace
awhile
the
drunken
cobbler
dies
of
course
but
spotless
cleanliness
and
sobriety
do
not
save
the
mother
of
seven
children
who
has
been
soaking
her
brick
floor
daily
with
water
from
a
poisoned
well
defiling
where
she
meant
to
clean
youth
does
not
save
the
buxom
lass
who
has
been
filling
herself
with
unripe
fruit
and
yet
sots
and
fools
escape
where
wise
men
fall
weakly
women
living
amid
all
wretchedness
nurse
unharmed
strong
men
who
have
breathed
fresh
air
all
day
headley
and
grace
and
old
willis
and
last
but
not
least
tom
thurnall
these
and
three
or
four
brave
women
organised
themselves
into
a
band
and
commenced
at
once
a
visitation
from
house
to
house
saving
thereby
many
a
life
but
within
hours
it
was
as
much
as
they
could
do
to
attend
to
the
acute
cases
grace
often
longed
to
die
but
knew
that
she
should
not
die
till
she
had
found
tom
belt
and
was
content
to
wait
tom
just
thought
nothing
about
death
and
danger
at
all
but
always
cheerful
always
busy
yet
never
in
a
hurry
went
up
and
down
seemingly
ubiquitous
sleep
he
got
when
he
could
and
food
as
often
as
he
could
into
the
sea
he
leapt
morning
and
night
and
came
out
fresher
every
time
the
only
person
in
the
town
who
seemed
to
grow
healthier
and
actually
happier
as
the
work
went
on
in
that
fearful
week
the
battle
is
over
at
last
and
tom
is
in
london
at
the
end
of
september
ready
to
go
to
war
as
medical
officer
to
the
turks
the
news
of
alma
has
just
arrived
but
he
pays
a
visit
to
whitbury
first
and
there
lord
minchampstead
sees
him
and
his
lordship
expresses
satisfaction
at
the
way
tom
conducted
the
business
at
pentremochyn
and
offers
him
a
post
of
queen
messenger
in
the
crimea
which
tom
accepts
with
profuse
thanks
before
tom
left
for
the
east
old
mark
armsworth
took
him
aside
and
said
what
do
you
think
of
the
man
who
marries
my
daughter
i
should
think
quoth
tom
wondering
who
the
happy
man
could
be
that
he
would
be
lucky
in
possessing
such
a
heart
then
be
as
good
as
your
word
and
take
her
yourself
i
watched
you
and
you
make
her
a
good
husband
tom
was
too
astonished
and
puzzled
to
reply
he
had
never
thought
that
he
had
found
such
favour
in
his
old
playfellow
mary
armsworth
eyes
it
was
a
terrible
temptation
he
knew
the
plain
english
of
and
mark
armsworth
daughter
a
good
house
a
good
consulting
practice
and
above
all
his
father
to
live
with
him
and
then
rose
up
before
his
imagination
the
steadfast
eyes
of
grace
harvey
and
seemed
to
look
through
and
through
his
inmost
soul
as
through
a
home
which
belonged
of
right
to
her
and
where
no
other
woman
must
dwell
or
could
dwell
for
she
was
there
and
he
knew
it
and
knew
that
even
if
he
never
married
till
his
dying
day
he
should
sell
his
soul
by
marrying
anyone
but
her
so
tom
told
old
mark
it
was
impossible
because
he
was
in
love
with
another
woman
and
then
just
as
he
was
packing
up
next
morning
came
a
note
from
mark
armsworth
and
a
cheque
for
to
thomas
thurnall
for
behaving
like
a
gentleman
and
tom
went
eastward
ho
two
years
ago
christmas
it
was
in
september
after
tom
had
left
that
grace
found
the
missing
belt
her
mother
had
hidden
it
in
a
cave
on
the
shore
and
grace
following
her
there
came
upon
the
the
shock
of
detection
brought
out
the
disease
against
which
harvey
had
taken
so
many
precautions
and
within
two
days
the
unhappy
woman
was
dead
grace
sold
all
her
mother
effects
paid
off
all
creditors
and
with
a
few
pounds
left
vanished
from
aberalva
she
had
written
at
once
to
tom
at
whitbury
telling
him
that
his
belt
and
money
were
safe
but
had
received
no
answer
and
now
she
went
to
whitbury
herself
only
to
arrive
a
week
after
tom
had
gone
mark
armsworth
and
mary
kept
her
for
a
night
and
she
left
tom
money
with
the
old
banker
retaining
the
belt
and
then
set
out
eastward
ho
too
to
nurse
the
wounded
in
the
war
and
if
possible
to
find
tom
and
clear
her
name
of
all
suspicion
how
grace
harvey
worked
at
scutari
and
at
balaclava
there
is
no
need
to
tell
why
mark
her
out
from
the
rest
when
all
did
more
than
nobly
in
due
time
she
went
home
to
england
home
but
not
to
aberalva
she
presented
herself
one
day
at
mark
armsworth
house
in
whitbury
and
begged
him
to
obtain
her
a
place
as
servant
to
old
thurnall
and
by
the
help
of
mark
and
mary
grace
harvey
took
up
her
abode
in
the
old
man
house
and
ere
a
month
was
past
she
was
to
him
a
daughter
mary
loved
her
wanted
to
call
her
sister
but
grace
drew
back
lovingly
but
humbly
from
all
advances
for
she
had
divined
mary
secret
with
the
quick
eye
of
a
woman
she
saw
how
mary
grew
daily
paler
sadder
be
it
so
mary
had
a
right
to
him
and
she
had
none
and
where
was
tom
thurnall
all
the
while
no
man
could
tell
mark
inquired
lord
minchampstead
inquired
great
personages
inquired
but
all
in
vain
a
few
knew
and
told
lord
minchampstead
who
told
mark
in
confidence
that
he
had
been
heard
of
last
in
the
circassian
mountains
about
christmas
but
since
then
all
was
blank
the
old
man
never
seemed
to
regret
him
and
never
mentioned
his
name
after
a
while
none
knew
it
was
because
he
and
grace
never
talked
of
anything
else
so
they
had
lived
and
so
they
had
waited
and
now
it
is
the
blessed
christmas
eve
the
light
is
failing
fast
when
down
the
high
street
comes
mark
portly
bulk
the
next
minute
he
has
entered
the
old
doctor
house
and
is
full
of
the
afternoon
run
for
he
has
been
out
the
old
doctor
is
confident
that
his
son
will
return
and
grace
reassures
him
yes
he
is
coming
soon
to
us
she
half
whispers
leaning
over
the
old
man
chair
or
else
we
are
soon
going
to
him
it
may
mean
that
sir
perhaps
it
is
better
that
it
should
it
matters
little
child
if
he
be
near
as
near
he
is
and
sure
enough
while
mark
is
telling
of
the
good
run
he
has
had
fresh
voice
is
heard
yes
there
he
was
in
bodily
flesh
and
blood
thin
sallow
bearded
to
the
eyes
dressed
in
ragged
sailor
clothes
grace
uttered
a
long
soft
half
laughing
cry
full
of
the
delicious
agony
of
sudden
relief
and
then
slipped
from
the
room
past
the
unheeding
tom
who
had
no
eyes
but
for
his
father
straight
up
to
the
old
man
he
went
took
both
his
hands
and
spoke
in
the
old
cheerful
voice
well
my
dear
old
daddy
i
afraid
i
made
you
very
anxious
but
it
was
not
my
fault
and
i
knew
you
would
be
certain
i
should
come
at
last
eh
my
son
my
son
murmured
the
old
man
you
wo
go
away
again
dear
boy
i
getting
old
and
forgetful
and
i
do
think
i
could
bear
it
again
you
see
never
again
as
long
as
i
live
daddy
mark
armsworth
burst
out
blubbering
like
a
great
boy
i
said
so
i
always
said
so
the
devil
could
not
kill
him
and
god
would
tom
said
his
father
presently
you
have
not
spoken
to
grace
yet
she
is
my
daughter
now
tom
and
has
been
these
twelve
months
past
if
she
is
not
she
will
be
soon
said
tom
quietly
with
that
he
walked
straight
out
of
the
room
to
find
grace
in
the
passage
and
grace
lay
silent
in
his
arms
charles
kingsley
wrote
the
a
fairy
tale
for
a
under
romantic
circumstances
reminded
in
of
a
promise
he
had
made
that
rose
maurice
and
mary
have
got
their
books
the
baby
must
have
his
kingsley
produced
the
story
about
little
tom
which
forms
the
first
chapter
in
the
a
fairy
tale
occupying
a
nook
of
its
own
in
the
literature
of
fantasy
for
children
after
running
serially
through
macmillan
magazine
the
was
published
in
book
form
in
dedicated
to
my
youngest
son
and
to
all
other
good
little
boys
kingsley
in
the
life
of
her
husband
says
that
it
was
perhaps
the
last
book
that
he
wrote
with
any
real
ease
the
story
with
its
irresponsible
and
whimsical
humour
throws
an
altogether
delightful
light
upon
the
character
of
charles
kingsley
clergyman
lecturer
historian
and
social
reformer
i
must
be
clean
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
and
his
name
was
tom
he
lived
in
a
great
town
in
the
north
country
where
there
were
plenty
of
chimneys
to
sweep
and
plenty
of
money
for
tom
to
earn
and
his
drunken
master
to
spend
he
could
not
read
nor
write
and
did
not
care
to
do
either
and
he
never
washed
himself
for
there
was
no
water
up
the
court
where
he
lived
and
hunger
and
beatings
he
took
all
for
the
way
of
the
world
and
when
his
master
let
him
have
a
pull
at
the
leavings
of
his
beer
tom
was
the
jolliest
boy
in
the
whole
town
one
day
tom
master
grimes
was
sent
for
to
sweep
all
the
chimneys
at
sir
john
harthover
mansion
harthover
place
at
four
in
the
morning
they
passed
through
the
silent
town
together
and
along
the
peaceful
country
roads
to
sir
john
grimes
riding
the
donkey
in
front
and
tom
and
the
brushes
walking
behind
on
the
way
they
came
up
with
an
old
irishwoman
limping
slowly
along
and
carrying
a
heavy
bundle
she
walked
along
with
tom
and
asked
him
many
questions
about
himself
and
seemed
very
sad
when
he
told
her
that
he
knew
no
prayers
to
say
she
told
him
that
she
lived
far
away
by
the
sea
and
how
the
sea
rolled
and
roared
on
winter
nights
and
lay
still
in
the
bright
summer
days
for
the
children
to
bathe
and
play
in
it
and
many
a
story
more
till
tom
longed
to
go
and
see
the
sea
and
bathe
in
it
likewise
when
at
length
they
came
to
a
spring
grimes
got
off
his
donkey
to
refresh
himself
by
dipping
his
head
in
the
water
because
tom
followed
his
example
his
master
immediately
thrashed
him
are
you
not
ashamed
of
yourself
thomas
grimes
said
the
irishwoman
grimes
looked
up
startled
at
her
knowing
his
name
but
he
answered
no
nor
never
was
yet
and
went
on
beating
tom
true
for
you
if
you
ever
had
been
ashamed
of
yourself
you
would
have
gone
into
vendale
long
ago
what
do
you
know
about
vendale
shouted
grimes
but
he
left
off
beating
tom
i
know
about
vendale
and
about
you
too
and
if
you
strike
that
boy
again
i
can
tell
you
what
i
know
grimes
seemed
quite
cowed
and
got
on
his
donkey
without
another
word
stop
said
the
irishwoman
i
have
one
more
word
for
you
both
for
you
will
see
me
again
those
that
wish
to
be
clean
clean
they
will
be
and
those
that
wish
to
be
foul
foul
they
will
be
remember
she
turned
away
into
a
meadow
and
disappeared
and
tom
and
grimes
went
on
their
way
when
they
came
to
harthover
place
the
housekeeper
turned
them
into
a
grand
room
all
covered
up
in
sheets
of
brown
paper
up
the
chimney
went
tom
with
a
kick
from
his
master
how
many
chimneys
tom
swept
i
can
not
say
but
he
swept
so
many
that
he
got
tired
and
puzzled
too
for
they
ran
into
one
another
so
that
he
fairly
lost
his
way
in
them
at
last
he
came
down
but
it
was
the
wrong
chimney
and
he
found
himself
in
a
room
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
seen
before
the
room
was
all
dressed
in
white
white
white
white
furniture
and
white
walls
there
was
a
with
ewers
and
basins
and
soap
and
brushes
and
towels
and
a
large
bath
full
of
clean
water
what
a
heap
of
things
all
for
washing
and
then
he
happened
to
look
towards
the
bed
and
there
lay
the
most
beautiful
little
girl
tom
had
ever
seen
he
wondered
whether
all
people
were
as
white
as
she
when
they
were
washed
thinking
of
this
he
tried
to
rub
some
of
the
soot
from
his
own
wrist
and
thought
perhaps
he
might
look
better
himself
if
he
were
clean
and
looking
round
he
suddenly
saw
a
little
ugly
black
figure
with
bleared
eyes
and
grinning
teeth
and
behold
it
was
himself
reflected
in
the
mirror
with
tears
of
shame
and
anger
at
the
contrast
he
turned
to
sneak
up
the
chimney
and
hide
but
in
his
haste
he
upset
the
up
jumped
the
little
white
lady
with
a
scream
in
rushed
her
nurse
and
made
a
dash
at
tom
but
out
of
the
window
went
he
and
down
a
tree
and
away
through
the
garden
and
the
park
into
the
wood
beyond
with
the
gardener
the
groom
the
dairymaid
grimes
the
steward
the
keeper
sir
john
and
the
irishwoman
all
in
hot
pursuit
through
the
wood
rushed
tom
until
he
came
to
a
wall
where
his
quick
wits
enabled
him
to
evade
his
pursuers
except
the
irishwoman
who
followed
him
all
the
way
although
he
never
knew
at
length
he
stood
on
a
limestone
rock
which
overhung
a
valley
a
thousand
feet
below
and
down
there
he
could
see
a
little
stream
winding
in
and
out
and
by
the
stream
a
cottage
it
was
a
dangerous
descent
but
down
went
tom
without
a
moment
hesitation
sick
and
giddy
on
he
went
until
at
last
he
dropped
on
the
grass
and
lay
there
unconscious
but
after
a
time
he
roused
himself
and
stumbled
on
to
the
cottage
the
old
dame
of
the
cottage
took
pity
on
him
and
laid
him
on
a
bed
of
sweet
hay
but
tom
could
not
rest
and
think
of
the
little
white
lady
he
found
his
way
to
the
river
murmuring
i
must
be
clean
i
must
be
clean
and
still
he
had
not
seen
the
irishwoman
in
front
of
him
now
for
she
had
stepped
into
the
river
just
before
tom
and
had
changed
into
the
most
beautiful
of
fairies
underneath
the
water
for
she
was
indeed
the
queen
of
the
who
were
all
waiting
to
receive
her
the
moment
she
came
back
from
the
tom
was
so
hot
and
longed
so
to
be
clean
for
once
that
he
tumbled
as
quick
as
he
could
into
the
cool
stream
and
he
had
not
been
in
it
half
a
minute
before
he
fell
into
the
quietest
coolest
sleep
that
ever
he
had
in
his
life
the
reason
of
his
falling
into
such
a
delightful
sleep
is
very
simple
it
was
merely
that
the
fairies
took
him
in
fact
they
turned
him
into
a
meanwhile
of
course
the
chase
after
tom
had
come
to
an
end
although
sir
john
and
his
keepers
made
a
second
search
the
next
day
for
he
felt
sorry
for
the
little
sweep
and
was
afraid
he
might
have
fallen
over
some
of
the
crags
they
found
the
little
fellow
rags
by
the
side
of
the
stream
and
they
also
discovered
his
body
in
the
water
and
buried
it
over
in
vendale
churchyard
a
lonely
mischievous
tom
was
very
happy
swimming
about
in
the
river
although
he
was
now
only
about
four
inches
long
with
a
set
of
external
gills
just
like
those
of
an
eft
there
are
and
why
not
some
people
tell
us
that
are
contrary
to
nature
but
there
are
so
many
things
in
nature
which
we
do
expect
to
find
that
there
may
as
well
be
as
not
he
was
still
as
mischievous
as
any
and
made
himself
a
perfect
nuisance
to
the
other
creatures
of
the
water
teasing
them
as
they
went
about
their
work
until
they
were
all
afraid
of
him
and
got
out
of
his
way
or
crept
into
their
shells
so
that
he
had
no
one
to
speak
to
or
to
play
with
it
was
from
a
that
he
learned
some
valuable
lessons
in
good
conduct
for
all
his
short
sight
the
had
noticed
a
great
many
interesting
things
in
nature
about
which
tom
knew
nothing
and
of
which
he
heard
with
wonder
one
day
he
might
have
been
eaten
by
an
otter
but
behold
seven
little
terrier
dogs
rushed
at
the
otter
and
drove
her
off
much
to
tom
relief
though
he
did
not
guess
that
these
were
really
sent
to
protect
him
but
before
the
otter
had
been
headed
off
she
had
twitted
tom
with
being
only
an
eft
and
told
him
he
would
be
eaten
by
the
salmon
when
they
came
up
from
the
sea
the
great
wide
sea
tom
himself
decided
he
would
go
down
the
stream
and
discover
what
the
great
wide
sea
was
like
one
night
tom
noticed
a
curious
light
and
heard
voices
of
men
coming
from
the
bank
of
the
river
soon
after
a
large
salmon
was
speared
then
other
men
seemed
to
arrive
there
were
shouts
and
scufflings
and
then
a
tremendous
splash
and
one
of
the
men
fell
into
the
river
close
to
tom
he
lay
so
still
that
tom
thought
the
water
must
have
sent
him
to
sleep
as
it
had
done
him
so
he
screwed
up
courage
to
go
and
look
at
him
the
moonlight
lit
up
the
face
and
tom
recognised
his
old
master
grimes
suppose
he
should
turn
into
a
but
he
lay
quite
still
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
and
never
went
poaching
salmon
any
more
every
creature
in
the
stream
seemed
to
be
hurrying
down
to
the
sea
and
tom
being
the
only
among
all
the
squirming
eels
and
the
scores
of
different
things
big
and
little
he
had
many
strange
adventures
before
he
came
to
the
sea
but
great
was
his
disappointment
to
find
no
there
to
play
with
though
he
asked
the
and
the
hermit
crabs
and
the
and
the
bass
and
the
porpoises
but
though
one
fish
told
him
that
he
had
been
helped
the
previous
night
by
the
tom
could
find
no
trace
of
them
at
all
now
one
day
it
befell
that
on
the
rocks
where
tom
was
sitting
with
a
lobster
there
walked
the
little
lady
ellie
herself
and
with
her
a
very
wise
man
professor
pttmllnsprts
who
was
a
very
great
naturalist
he
was
showing
her
about
one
in
ten
thousand
of
all
the
beautiful
and
curious
things
that
are
to
be
seen
among
the
rocks
presently
as
he
groped
with
his
net
among
the
weeds
he
caught
poor
tom
dear
me
he
cried
what
a
large
pink
holothurian
it
has
actually
eyes
why
it
must
be
a
cephalopod
it
is
a
cried
ellie
my
dear
said
the
professor
sharply
now
tom
was
in
a
most
horrible
fright
and
between
fright
and
rage
he
turned
to
bay
and
bit
the
professor
finger
oh
eh
cried
he
and
dropped
tom
on
to
the
seaweed
whence
he
was
gone
in
a
moment
but
it
was
a
cried
ellie
ah
it
is
gone
and
she
jumped
down
off
the
rock
but
she
slipped
and
fell
with
her
head
on
a
sharp
rock
and
lay
quite
still
the
professor
picked
her
up
and
took
her
home
and
she
was
put
to
bed
but
she
would
not
waken
at
all
and
after
a
week
one
moonlight
night
the
fairies
came
flying
in
at
the
window
and
brought
her
a
pair
of
wings
and
she
flew
away
and
nobody
heard
or
saw
anything
of
her
for
a
long
while
in
brandon
fairy
after
tom
slipped
away
into
the
water
again
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
ellie
and
longed
to
have
her
to
play
with
for
he
had
not
succeeded
in
finding
any
other
but
soon
he
had
something
else
to
think
of
one
day
he
helped
a
lobster
caught
in
a
to
get
free
and
then
five
minutes
after
he
came
upon
a
real
live
sitting
on
the
white
sand
and
it
ran
to
tom
and
tom
ran
to
it
and
they
hugged
and
kissed
each
other
for
ever
so
long
at
last
tom
said
well
this
is
wonderful
i
have
seen
things
just
like
you
again
and
again
but
i
thought
you
were
shells
or
now
was
not
this
very
odd
so
odd
indeed
that
you
will
no
doubt
want
to
know
how
it
happened
and
why
tom
could
never
find
a
till
after
he
had
got
the
lobster
out
of
the
pot
but
if
you
will
read
this
story
nine
times
over
you
will
find
out
why
it
is
not
good
for
little
boys
and
girls
to
be
told
everything
and
never
to
be
forced
to
make
use
of
their
own
wits
now
said
the
baby
come
and
help
me
plant
this
rock
which
got
all
its
flowers
knocked
off
in
the
last
storm
or
i
shall
not
have
finished
before
my
brothers
and
sisters
come
and
it
is
now
time
to
go
home
so
they
worked
away
at
the
rock
and
planted
it
and
smoothed
the
sand
down
round
it
and
capital
fun
they
had
till
the
tide
began
to
turn
and
then
tom
heard
all
the
other
babies
coming
laughing
and
singing
and
romping
and
the
noise
they
made
was
just
like
the
noise
of
a
ripple
and
in
they
came
dozens
and
dozens
of
them
and
when
they
found
that
he
was
a
new
baby
they
hugged
and
kissed
him
and
there
was
no
one
ever
so
happy
as
poor
little
tom
and
he
gaily
swam
away
with
them
to
their
home
in
the
caves
beneath
brandan
fairy
isle
but
i
wish
tom
had
given
up
all
his
naughty
tricks
he
would
meddle
with
the
creatures
frighten
the
crabs
and
put
stones
in
the
anemones
mouths
to
make
them
fancy
dinner
was
coming
the
other
children
warned
him
and
said
take
care
what
you
are
at
as
bedonebyasyoudid
is
coming
on
friday
early
one
friday
morning
this
tremendous
lady
came
indeed
very
ugly
tom
thought
her
with
her
green
spectacles
on
a
great
hooked
nose
and
a
big
birch
rod
under
her
arm
she
looked
at
all
the
children
and
seemed
pleased
with
them
for
she
gave
or
to
them
all
at
last
tom
turn
came
and
she
put
something
in
his
mouth
and
lo
and
behold
it
was
a
cold
hard
pebble
who
put
pebbles
in
the
mouths
to
make
them
fancy
they
had
caught
a
good
dinner
as
you
did
to
them
so
i
must
do
to
you
tom
thought
her
very
hard
but
she
showed
him
she
had
to
do
it
because
it
was
her
work
she
told
him
too
that
she
was
the
ugliest
fairy
in
the
world
and
would
be
until
people
learned
to
behave
as
they
should
when
she
would
grow
as
handsome
as
her
sister
doasyouwouldbedoneby
the
loveliest
fairy
in
the
world
tom
tried
hard
to
be
good
on
saturday
he
did
not
frighten
one
crab
nor
put
one
pebble
into
a
mouth
sunday
came
and
so
did
doasyouwouldbedoneby
all
the
children
danced
round
her
for
she
had
the
sweetest
merriest
face
tom
had
ever
seen
he
the
new
they
informed
the
fairy
he
never
had
any
mother
then
i
will
be
his
mother
she
said
and
took
him
in
her
arms
and
tom
looked
up
in
her
face
and
loved
her
and
fell
asleep
for
very
love
when
he
awoke
she
was
telling
the
children
a
story
now
she
said
to
tom
as
she
prepared
to
go
will
you
be
good
and
torment
no
until
i
come
again
tom
promised
and
tormented
no
after
that
as
long
as
he
lived
and
he
is
quite
alive
i
assure
you
still
at
the
being
happy
and
comfortable
does
not
always
mean
being
good
and
so
it
was
with
tom
he
had
everything
he
could
wish
for
in
brandan
fairy
isle
but
now
he
had
grown
so
fond
of
lollipops
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
longed
to
go
to
the
cabinet
where
they
were
kept
at
last
he
went
to
take
just
one
then
he
had
one
more
and
another
and
another
until
they
were
all
gone
and
all
the
while
bedonebyasyoudid
stood
close
behind
him
though
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
her
tom
was
very
surprised
when
she
came
again
to
see
that
she
had
just
as
many
lollipops
as
before
he
thought
therefore
that
she
could
not
know
but
he
was
very
unhappy
all
that
week
and
long
after
it
too
and
because
his
conscience
had
been
pricking
him
inside
his
outside
grew
horny
and
prickly
as
well
until
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
told
bedonebyasyoudid
all
about
it
and
asked
her
to
take
away
the
prickles
but
she
told
him
only
he
could
do
that
that
he
must
go
to
school
and
she
would
fetch
him
a
schoolmistress
soon
she
returned
with
the
most
beautiful
little
girl
that
was
ever
seen
tom
begged
her
to
show
him
how
to
be
good
and
get
rid
of
his
prickles
so
she
began
and
taught
him
every
day
except
on
sunday
when
she
went
away
in
a
short
time
all
tom
prickles
had
disappeared
then
the
little
girl
knew
him
she
said
for
the
little
who
had
come
into
the
bedroom
and
i
know
you
said
tom
you
are
the
little
white
lady
i
saw
in
bed
and
then
they
began
telling
each
other
all
their
story
and
then
they
set
to
work
at
their
lessons
again
and
both
liked
them
so
well
that
they
went
on
till
seven
full
years
were
past
and
gone
tom
began
to
be
very
curious
to
know
where
ellie
went
on
sundays
and
why
he
could
not
go
too
those
who
go
there
said
bedonebyasyoudid
must
first
learn
to
go
where
they
do
not
want
to
go
and
to
help
someone
they
do
not
like
and
doasyouwouldbedoneby
said
the
same
tom
was
very
unhappy
now
he
knew
the
fairy
wanted
him
to
go
and
help
grimes
he
did
not
want
to
go
and
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
not
going
but
just
when
he
was
feeling
most
discontented
bedonebyasyoudid
encouraged
him
until
he
was
quite
anxious
to
seek
for
grimes
grimes
is
now
at
the
said
the
fairy
to
get
there
you
must
go
to
shiny
wall
and
through
the
white
gate
which
has
never
yet
been
opened
you
will
then
be
at
peacepool
where
you
will
find
mother
carey
who
will
direct
you
to
the
tom
immediately
set
out
to
find
his
way
to
shiny
wall
asking
the
way
of
all
the
birds
and
beasts
he
met
he
at
length
received
help
from
the
petrels
who
are
mother
carey
chickens
and
so
reached
shiny
wall
he
was
dismayed
to
find
that
there
was
no
gate
but
taking
the
advice
he
dived
underneath
the
wall
and
went
along
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
until
he
arrived
in
peacepool
there
sat
mother
carey
a
marble
lady
on
a
marble
throne
motionless
restful
gazing
down
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
following
mother
carey
directions
tom
at
length
arrived
at
the
after
meeting
with
many
strange
adventures
he
had
not
long
arrived
in
this
strange
land
when
he
was
overtaken
by
several
policemen
truncheons
one
of
which
conducted
him
to
the
prison
where
grimes
was
quartered
here
on
the
roof
his
head
and
shoulders
just
showing
above
the
top
of
chimney
no
was
poor
grimes
with
a
pipe
that
would
not
draw
he
thought
tom
had
simply
come
to
laugh
at
him
until
he
assured
him
that
he
had
only
come
to
help
suddenly
bedonebyasyoudid
appeared
she
reminded
grimes
that
he
was
only
suffering
now
what
he
had
inflicted
on
tom
she
told
him
too
how
his
mother
had
gone
to
heaven
and
would
no
more
weep
for
him
gradually
grimes
heart
softened
and
when
tom
described
her
kindness
to
him
at
vendale
grimes
wept
then
his
tears
did
for
him
what
his
mother
could
not
do
for
as
they
fell
they
washed
the
soot
off
his
face
and
his
clothes
and
loosened
the
mortar
from
the
bricks
of
the
chimney
will
you
obey
me
if
i
give
you
a
chance
said
bedonebyasyoudid
as
you
please
for
i
beat
and
that
the
truth
said
he
be
it
so
then
you
may
come
out
but
remember
disobey
me
again
and
into
a
worse
place
still
you
will
go
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
never
disobeyed
you
that
i
know
of
i
never
set
eyes
upon
you
until
i
came
to
these
ugly
quarters
never
saw
me
who
said
that
will
be
foul
foul
they
will
be
grimes
looked
up
and
tom
looked
up
too
for
the
voice
was
that
of
the
irishwoman
who
met
them
the
day
they
went
out
together
to
harthover
she
ordered
grimes
to
march
off
in
the
custody
of
the
truncheon
who
was
to
see
that
he
devoted
himself
to
the
considerable
task
of
sweeping
out
the
crater
of
etna
tom
went
back
to
brandan
isle
and
there
found
ellie
grown
into
a
beautiful
woman
and
he
looked
at
her
and
she
looked
at
him
and
they
liked
the
employment
so
much
that
they
stood
and
looked
for
seven
years
more
and
neither
spoke
nor
stirred
at
last
they
heard
the
fairy
say
attention
children
are
you
never
going
to
look
at
me
again
they
looked
and
both
of
them
cried
out
at
once
you
are
our
dear
doasyouwouldbedoneby
no
you
are
good
bedonebyasyoudid
but
you
are
grown
quite
beautiful
now
to
you
she
said
but
look
again
you
are
mother
carey
said
tom
in
a
very
low
solemn
voice
for
he
had
found
out
something
which
made
him
very
happy
and
yet
frightened
him
more
than
all
that
he
had
ever
seen
and
when
they
looked
again
she
was
neither
of
them
and
yet
all
of
them
at
once
my
name
is
written
in
my
eyes
if
you
have
eyes
to
see
it
there
and
her
eyes
flashed
for
one
moment
clear
white
blazing
light
but
the
children
could
not
read
her
name
for
they
were
dazzled
and
hid
their
faces
in
their
hands
not
yet
young
things
not
yet
said
she
smiling
and
then
she
turned
to
ellie
you
may
take
him
home
with
you
on
sundays
ellie
he
has
won
his
spurs
in
the
great
battle
and
become
fit
to
be
a
man
because
he
has
done
the
thing
he
did
not
like

in
and
on
the
whole
may
be
accepted
as
the
most
popular
of
all
charles
novels
it
is
a
story
full
of
the
life
and
stir
of
elizabethan
england
and
its
heroes
and
heroines
are
the
devonshire
people
whom
kingsley
knew
and
loved
so
well
like
most
historical
romances
westward
ho
must
not
be
accepted
as
history
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
its
author
was
regius
professor
of
history
at
cambridge
kingsley
and
entirely
creditable
patriotism
and
his
intense
devotion
to
the
established
church
of
england
prevented
his
doing
justice
to
spain
or
looking
with
sympathy
on
roman
catholicism
see
newman
vol
xiii
kingsley
never
could
refrain
from
preaching
his
own
convictions
and
while
this
often
interfered
with
the
art
of
the
novelist
it
gave
a
note
of
sincerity
to
all
his
work
and
warmth
and
colour
to
his
style
how
amyas
came
home
the
first
one
bright
summer
afternoon
in
the
year
a
tall
and
fair
boy
came
lingering
along
bideford
quay
in
his
scholar
gown
with
satchel
and
slate
in
hand
watching
wistfully
the
shipping
and
the
sailors
till
just
after
he
had
passed
the
bottom
of
the
high
street
he
came
to
a
group
of
sailors
listening
earnestly
to
someone
who
stood
in
the
midst
the
boy
all
alive
for
any
sea
news
must
needs
go
up
to
them
and
so
came
in
for
the
following
speech
delivered
in
a
loud
bold
voice
with
a
strong
devonshire
accent
i
tell
you
as
i
john
oxenham
am
a
gentleman
i
saw
it
with
these
eyes
and
so
did
salvation
yeo
there
and
we
measured
the
heap
seventy
foot
long
ten
foot
broad
and
twelve
foot
high
of
silver
bars
and
each
bar
between
a
thirty
and
forty
pound
weight
come
along
who
lists
who
lists
who
make
his
fortune
who
list
cried
a
tall
gaunt
man
whom
the
other
had
called
salvation
yeo
now
your
time
we
got
forty
men
to
plymouth
now
ready
to
sail
the
minute
we
get
back
and
we
want
a
dozen
out
of
you
bideford
men
and
just
a
boy
or
two
and
then
we
off
and
away
and
make
our
fortunes
or
go
to
heaven
then
the
gaunt
man
pulled
from
under
his
arm
a
great
white
buffalo
horn
covered
with
rough
etchings
of
land
and
sea
the
horn
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
the
schoolboy
got
a
nearer
sight
of
the
marvel
to
his
astonished
gaze
displayed
themselves
cities
and
harbours
plate
ships
of
spain
and
islands
with
apes
and
and
here
and
there
here
is
gold
and
again
much
gold
and
silver
the
boy
turned
it
round
and
round
anxious
to
possess
this
wonderful
horn
and
oxenham
asked
him
why
he
was
so
keen
after
it
because
said
he
looking
up
boldly
i
want
to
go
to
sea
i
want
to
see
the
indies
i
want
to
fight
the
spaniards
and
the
lad
having
hurried
out
his
say
dropped
his
head
and
you
shall
cried
oxenham
whose
son
are
you
my
gallant
fellow
leigh
of
burrough
court
bless
his
soul
i
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
the
eddystone
tell
your
father
john
oxenham
will
come
and
keep
him
company
the
boy
amyas
leigh
took
his
way
homewards
and
that
night
john
oxenham
dined
at
burrough
court
but
failed
to
get
leigh
leave
to
take
young
amyas
with
him
nor
did
sir
richard
grenville
the
godfather
who
was
also
at
dinner
help
him
with
his
suit
but
somewhat
more
than
a
twelvemonth
later
leigh
going
down
on
business
to
exeter
assizes
caught
as
was
too
common
in
those
days
the
from
the
prisoners
sickened
in
the
very
court
and
died
within
a
week
you
must
be
my
father
now
sir
said
young
amyas
firmly
to
sir
richard
grenville
on
the
day
after
the
funeral
and
shortly
afterwards
amyas
having
broken
his
slate
on
the
head
of
vindex
brimblecombe
sir
richard
thought
it
well
to
go
up
to
burrough
and
after
much
talk
and
many
tears
matters
were
so
concluded
that
amyas
leigh
found
himself
riding
joyfully
towards
plymouth
and
being
handed
over
to
captain
drake
vanished
for
three
years
from
the
good
town
of
bideford
and
now
he
is
returned
in
triumph
and
the
observed
of
all
observers
the
bells
of
bideford
church
can
not
help
breaking
forth
into
a
jocund
peal
bideford
streets
are
a
very
of
all
the
colours
swarming
with
seamen
and
burghers
and
burghers
wives
and
daughters
all
in
their
holiday
attire
garlands
are
hung
across
the
streets
and
tapestries
from
every
window
every
stable
is
crammed
with
horses
and
sir
richard
grenville
house
is
like
a
very
tavern
along
the
little
churchyard
streams
all
the
gentle
blood
of
north
devon
and
on
into
the
church
where
all
are
placed
according
to
their
degrees
not
without
shovings
and
whisperings
from
one
matron
and
another
at
last
there
is
a
silence
and
a
looking
toward
the
door
and
then
distant
music
which
comes
braying
and
screaming
up
to
the
very
church
doors
why
are
all
eyes
fixed
on
those
four
mariners
decked
out
with
knots
and
ribbons
by
loving
hands
and
yet
more
on
that
gigantic
figure
who
walks
before
them
a
beardless
boy
and
yet
with
the
frame
and
stature
of
a
hercules
towering
like
saul
of
old
a
head
and
shoulders
above
all
the
congregation
and
why
as
the
five
fall
on
their
knees
before
the
altar
rails
are
all
eyes
turned
to
the
pew
where
leigh
of
burrough
has
hid
her
face
between
her
hands
and
her
hood
rustles
and
shakes
to
her
joyful
sobs
because
there
was
of
old
in
country
and
in
town
and
these
are
devon
men
and
men
of
bideford
and
they
the
first
of
all
english
mariners
have
sailed
round
the
world
with
francis
drake
and
are
come
to
give
god
thanks
the
brotherhood
of
the
it
was
during
the
three
years
of
amyas
absence
that
rose
salterne
the
motherless
daughter
of
that
honest
merchant
the
mayor
of
bideford
had
grown
into
so
beautiful
a
girl
of
eighteen
that
half
north
devon
was
mad
about
the
rose
of
torridge
as
she
was
called
there
was
not
a
young
gallant
for
ten
miles
round
who
would
not
have
gone
to
jerusalem
to
win
her
and
not
a
week
passed
but
some
nosegay
or
languishing
sonnet
was
conveyed
into
the
rose
chamber
all
of
which
she
stowed
away
with
the
simplicity
of
a
country
girl
frank
leigh
amyas
elder
brother
who
had
won
himself
honour
at
home
and
abroad
and
was
the
friend
of
sir
philip
sidney
and
in
favour
at
the
court
of
queen
elizabeth
fell
as
deeply
in
love
with
the
rose
when
he
came
home
to
rejoice
over
the
return
of
amyas
as
any
young
squire
of
the
county
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
set
off
again
for
london
and
for
amyas
to
join
the
queen
forces
in
ireland
where
war
was
now
raging
frank
and
amyas
concocted
a
scheme
which
was
put
into
effect
the
next
day
first
by
the
innkeeper
of
the
ship
tavern
who
began
under
amyas
orders
a
bustle
of
roasting
and
boiling
and
next
by
amyas
himself
who
invited
as
many
of
his
old
schoolfellows
as
frank
had
pointed
out
to
him
to
a
merry
supper
by
which
crafty
scheme
in
came
each
of
rose
gentle
admirers
and
found
himself
seated
at
the
table
with
six
rivals
when
the
cloth
was
drawn
and
sack
and
sugar
became
the
order
of
the
day
and
the
queen
health
had
been
duly
drunk
with
all
the
honours
frank
rose
and
now
gentlemen
let
me
give
you
a
health
which
none
of
you
i
dare
say
will
refuse
to
drink
with
heart
and
soul
as
well
as
with
lips
the
health
of
one
whom
beauty
and
virtue
have
so
ennobled
that
in
their
light
the
shadow
of
lowly
birth
is
unseen
the
health
of
rose
of
torridge
and
a
double
health
to
that
worthy
gentleman
whosoever
he
may
be
whom
she
is
fated
to
honour
with
her
love
whereupon
young
will
cary
of
clovelly
court
calls
out
join
hands
all
round
and
swear
eternal
friendship
as
brothers
of
the
sacred
order
of
the
of
what
frank
leigh
the
rose
said
frank
quietly
and
somehow
or
other
whether
it
was
frank
chivalrous
speech
or
cary
fun
or
amyas
good
wine
or
the
nobleness
which
lies
in
every
young
lad
heart
the
whole
party
shook
hands
all
round
and
vowed
on
the
hilt
of
amyas
sword
to
stand
by
each
other
and
by
their
and
neither
grudge
nor
grumble
let
her
dance
with
flirt
with
or
marry
with
whom
she
would
and
in
order
that
the
honour
of
their
peerless
dame
and
the
brotherhood
which
was
named
after
her
might
be
spread
through
all
lands
they
would
go
home
and
ask
their
fathers
leave
to
go
abroad
wheresoever
there
were
good
wars
then
amyas
hearing
a
sneeze
made
a
dash
at
the
arras
behind
him
and
finding
a
doorway
there
speedily
returned
dragging
out
john
brimblecombe
the
stout
son
of
the
schoolmaster
jack
brimblecombe
now
and
a
bachelor
of
oxford
was
in
person
exceedingly
like
a
pig
but
he
was
a
pig
of
and
serene
spirit
always
while
watching
for
the
best
contented
with
the
worst
and
therefore
fattening
fast
while
other
pigs
ribs
stare
through
their
skins
he
had
lingered
in
the
passage
hovering
around
the
fragrant
smell
and
once
there
he
could
not
help
hearing
what
passed
inside
till
rose
salterne
name
fell
on
his
ear
and
now
behold
him
brought
in
to
judgment
not
without
a
kick
or
two
from
the
wrathful
foot
of
amyas
leigh
what
business
have
i
here
said
jack
making
answer
fiercely
amid
much
puffing
and
blowing
as
much
as
any
of
you
if
you
had
asked
me
in
i
would
have
come
you
laugh
at
me
because
i
a
poor
parson
son
and
you
fine
gentlemen
god
made
us
both
i
reckon
i
tell
you
i
loved
her
these
three
years
as
well
as
a
one
of
you
i
have
make
me
one
of
your
brotherhood
and
see
if
i
do
not
dare
to
suffer
as
much
as
any
of
you
let
me
but
be
your
chaplain
and
pray
for
your
luck
when
at
the
wars
if
i
do
stay
at
home
in
a
country
curacy
is
not
much
that
you
need
be
jealous
of
me
with
her
i
reckon
so
presently
after
a
certain
mock
ceremonial
of
initiation
jack
brimblecombe
was
declared
on
the
word
of
frank
leigh
admitted
to
the
brotherhood
and
was
sent
home
with
a
pint
of
good
red
alicant
wine
in
him
while
the
rest
had
a
right
merry
evening
after
which
they
all
departed
amyas
and
cary
to
ireland
frank
to
the
court
again
and
so
the
brotherhood
of
the
rose
was
scattered
and
mistress
salterne
was
left
alone
with
her
the
good
ship
when
amyas
was
in
ireland
he
made
captive
a
certain
spanish
grandee
don
guzman
and
sent
him
to
sir
richard
grenville
to
be
held
at
ransom
and
then
the
irish
being
for
the
time
subdued
amyas
sailed
with
sir
humphrey
gilbert
on
that
voyage
to
newfoundland
and
returned
in
rags
landing
at
plymouth
where
he
learnt
news
of
bideford
hawkins
wife
of
john
hawkins
the
port
admiral
gave
him
supper
and
then
told
him
that
the
spanish
prisoner
had
gone
off
the
villain
without
paying
his
ransom
i
ca
say
that
but
there
a
poor
innocent
young
maid
gone
off
with
him
one
salterne
daughter
rose
salterne
the
mayor
daughter
the
rose
of
torridge
that
her
bless
your
dear
soul
what
ails
you
amyas
had
dropped
back
in
his
seat
as
if
he
had
been
shot
but
he
recovered
himself
and
next
morning
started
for
bideford
the
story
was
true
don
guzman
had
been
made
governor
of
la
guayra
in
the
west
indies
and
his
ransom
had
been
paid
but
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
rose
and
the
girl
driven
some
said
by
the
of
her
father
who
loved
his
daughter
and
knew
not
how
to
manage
her
had
willingly
escaped
with
him
amyas
called
on
salterne
and
the
old
burgher
besought
him
to
go
in
pursuit
of
the
spaniard
and
promised
he
would
spend
any
money
that
was
needed
to
fit
out
a
ship
to
avenge
his
child
and
amyas
heard
that
honest
john
brimblecombe
now
a
parson
mindful
of
his
oath
to
the
brotherhood
was
longing
to
seek
the
rose
though
it
might
be
in
the
jaws
of
death
will
cary
too
was
for
a
voyage
to
the
indies
to
cut
the
throat
of
don
guzman
then
leigh
and
frank
her
getting
permission
to
leave
the
court
both
consented
to
the
voyage
and
frank
would
go
too
old
salterne
grumbled
at
any
man
save
himself
spending
a
penny
on
the
voyage
and
forced
on
the
adventurers
a
good
ship
of
two
hundred
tons
burden
and
five
hundred
pounds
towards
fitting
her
out
leigh
worked
day
and
night
at
clothes
and
comforts
of
every
kind
amyas
gave
his
time
and
his
brains
cary
went
about
beating
up
recruits
while
john
brimblecombe
preached
a
fierce
crusade
against
the
spaniards
and
frank
grew
more
and
more
proud
of
his
brother
old
salvation
yeo
who
was
now
in
bideford
again
brought
twenty
good
men
from
plymouth
who
had
sailed
with
drake
and
now
november
has
come
and
the
tall
ship
rose
with
a
hundred
men
on
board
and
food
in
abundance
has
dropped
down
from
bideford
quay
to
appledore
pool
she
is
with
cannon
and
muskets
and
swords
and
all
agreed
so
a
ship
had
never
sailed
out
over
bar
leigh
went
to
the
rocky
knoll
outside
the
churchyard
wall
and
watched
the
ship
glide
out
between
the
yellow
dunes
and
lessen
slowly
hour
by
hour
into
the
boundless
west
till
her
hull
sank
below
the
dim
horizon
and
her
white
sails
faded
away
into
the
grey
atlantic
mist
and
the
good
ship
rose
went
westward
ho
and
came
in
due
time
to
la
guayra
in
the
indies
the
highest
cliff
on
earth
some
seven
thousand
feet
of
rock
parted
from
the
sea
by
a
narrow
strip
of
bright
green
lowland
amyas
and
his
company
are
at
last
in
full
sight
of
the
spot
in
quest
of
which
they
have
sailed
four
thousand
miles
of
sea
beyond
the
town
two
or
three
hundred
feet
up
the
steep
mountain
side
is
a
large
white
house
with
a
royal
flag
of
spain
flaunting
before
it
that
must
be
the
governor
house
that
must
be
the
abode
of
the
rose
of
torridge
there
are
ships
of
war
in
the
amyas
plan
was
to
wait
till
midnight
attack
the
town
on
the
west
plunder
the
government
storehouses
and
then
fight
their
way
back
to
their
boats
to
reach
the
governor
house
seemed
impossible
with
the
small
force
at
their
disposal
but
frank
would
not
have
their
going
away
without
doing
the
very
thing
for
which
they
came
i
will
go
up
to
that
house
amyas
and
speak
with
her
he
said
then
amyas
cary
and
brimblecombe
drew
lots
as
to
which
of
them
should
accompany
him
and
the
lot
fell
upon
amyas
leigh
at
midnight
amyas
went
on
deck
and
asked
for
six
volunteers
whosoever
would
come
should
have
double
prize
money
why
six
only
captain
said
an
old
seaman
give
the
word
and
any
and
all
of
us
will
go
up
with
you
sack
the
house
and
bring
off
the
treasure
and
the
lady
before
two
hours
are
out
no
no
my
brave
lads
as
for
treasure
it
is
sure
to
have
been
put
all
safe
into
the
forts
and
as
for
the
lady
god
forbid
that
we
should
force
her
a
step
without
her
own
will
the
boat
with
frank
amyas
and
the
six
seamen
reached
the
pebble
beach
there
seemed
no
difficulty
about
finding
the
path
to
the
house
so
bright
was
the
moon
leaving
the
men
with
the
boat
they
started
up
the
beach
with
their
swords
only
she
may
expect
us
whispered
frank
she
may
have
seen
our
ship
and
some
secret
sympathy
will
draw
her
down
towards
the
sea
they
found
the
path
which
wound
in
up
the
steep
rocky
slope
easily
it
ended
at
a
and
they
found
the
gate
was
open
when
they
tried
it
what
is
your
plan
said
amyas
i
have
none
i
go
where
i
am
called
love
willing
victim
amyas
was
at
his
wits
end
a
light
was
burning
in
a
window
on
the
upper
story
twenty
black
figures
lay
sleeping
on
the
terrace
frank
saw
the
shadow
of
the
rose
against
the
window
she
came
down
and
he
made
a
wild
appeal
to
her
your
conscience
your
religion
no
never
i
can
face
the
chance
of
death
but
not
the
loss
of
my
husband
go
for
god
sake
leave
me
frank
turned
and
amyas
dragged
him
down
the
hill
both
were
too
proud
to
run
but
the
whole
gang
of
negroes
were
in
pursuit
and
stones
were
flying
they
were
not
yards
from
the
boat
when
the
storm
burst
and
a
volley
of
great
quartz
pebbles
whistled
round
their
heads
frank
is
struck
and
amyas
takes
him
over
his
shoulders
and
plunges
wildly
on
towards
the
beach
men
to
the
rescue
amyas
shouts
fire
men
give
it
the
black
villains
the
arquebuses
crackled
from
the
boat
in
front
but
balls
are
answering
from
behind
the
governor
guard
have
turned
out
followed
them
to
the
beach
and
are
firing
over
the
negroes
heads
amyas
is
up
to
his
knees
in
water
battered
with
stones
blinded
with
blood
but
frank
is
still
in
his
arms
another
heavy
blow
confused
mass
of
negroes
and
english
foam
and
pebbles
a
confused
roar
of
shouts
shots
curses
and
he
recollects
no
more
he
is
lying
in
the
of
the
boat
stiff
and
weak
two
men
only
are
left
of
the
six
and
frank
is
not
in
the
boat
with
weary
work
they
made
the
ship
and
as
the
alarm
being
now
given
it
was
hardly
safe
to
remain
where
they
were
it
was
agreed
to
weigh
anchor
amyas
had
no
hope
that
frank
might
still
be
alive
so
ended
that
fatal
venture
of
mistaken
chivalry
amyas
comes
home
for
the
third
more
than
three
years
have
passed
since
the
rose
sailed
out
from
bideford
and
never
a
word
has
reached
england
of
what
has
befallen
the
ship
and
her
company
many
have
been
the
adventures
of
amyas
and
the
men
who
have
followed
him
treasure
they
have
got
in
south
america
and
old
salvation
yeo
has
found
a
young
girl
whom
he
had
lost
twelve
years
before
grown
up
wild
among
the
indians
ayacanora
she
is
called
and
she
is
white
for
her
father
was
an
englishman
and
her
mother
spanish
for
all
her
savage
ways
and
will
not
be
separated
from
her
discoverers
but
insists
on
going
with
them
to
england
and
amyas
has
learnt
that
his
brother
frank
was
burnt
by
order
of
the
inquisition
and
with
him
rose
and
that
don
guzman
had
resigned
the
governorship
of
la
guayra
amyas
swore
a
dreadful
oath
before
all
his
men
when
he
was
told
of
the
death
of
frank
and
rose
that
as
long
as
he
had
eyes
to
see
a
spaniard
and
hands
to
hew
him
down
he
would
give
no
quarter
to
that
accursed
nation
and
that
he
would
avenge
all
the
innocent
blood
shed
by
them
and
now
it
is
february
and
leigh
grown
grey
and
feeble
in
step
is
pacing
up
and
down
the
terrace
walk
at
burrough
a
flash
is
seen
in
the
fast
darkening
twilight
and
then
comes
the
thunder
of
a
gun
at
sea
twenty
minutes
later
and
a
ship
has
turned
up
the
bideford
river
and
a
cheer
goes
up
from
her
crew
yes
amyas
has
come
and
with
him
will
cary
and
the
honest
parson
jack
brimblecombe
and
the
good
seamen
of
devon
and
ayacanora
who
knelt
down
obedient
before
leigh
because
she
had
seen
amyas
kneel
and
whom
leigh
took
by
the
hand
and
led
to
court
william
salterne
would
take
none
of
his
share
of
the
treasure
which
was
brought
home
and
which
he
had
a
just
claim
to
the
treasure
is
yours
sir
he
said
to
amyas
i
have
enough
and
more
than
enough
and
if
i
have
a
claim
in
law
for
aught
which
i
know
not
neither
shall
ever
ask
why
if
you
are
not
too
proud
accept
that
claim
as
a
plain
burgher
to
you
sir
for
a
great
and
a
noble
love
which
you
and
your
brother
have
shown
to
one
who
though
i
say
it
to
my
shame
was
not
worthy
thereof
that
night
old
salterne
was
found
dead
kneeling
by
his
daughter
bed
his
will
lay
by
him
any
money
due
to
him
as
owner
of
the
rose
and
a
new
barque
of
tons
burden
he
had
bequeathed
to
captain
amyas
leigh
on
condition
that
he
should
that
barque
the
vengeance
and
with
her
sail
once
more
against
the
spaniard
in
the
summer
of
comes
the
great
armada
and
captain
leigh
has
the
vengeance
fitted
out
for
war
and
is
in
the
english
channel
he
has
found
out
that
don
guzman
is
on
board
the
santa
catherina
and
is
set
on
taking
his
revenge
for
twelve
months
past
this
hatred
of
don
guzman
has
been
eating
out
his
heart
and
now
the
hour
has
struck
but
the
armada
melts
away
in
the
storms
of
the
north
sea
and
captain
leigh
has
pursued
the
santa
catherina
round
the
orkneys
and
down
to
lundy
island
and
there
on
the
rock
called
the
shutter
the
santa
catherina
strikes
and
then
vanishes
for
ever
and
ever
shame
cried
amyas
hurling
his
sword
far
into
the
sea
to
lose
my
right
when
it
was
in
my
very
grasp
a
crack
which
rent
the
sky
a
bright
world
of
flame
and
then
a
blank
of
utter
darkness
the
great
proud
sea
captain
has
been
struck
blind
by
the
flash
of
lightning
once
more
amyas
leigh
has
come
home
his
work
is
over
his
hatred
dead
and
ayacanora
will
comfort
him
amyas
my
son
said
leigh
fear
not
to
take
her
to
your
heart
for
it
is
your
mother
who
has
laid
her
there
it
is
true
after
all
said
amyas
to
himself
what
god
has
joined
together
man
can
not
put
asunder
henry
kingsley
geoffry
hamlyn
henry
kingsley
younger
brother
of
charles
kingsley
was
born
at
barnack
northamptonshire
england
leaving
worcester
college
oxford
in
he
with
a
number
of
emigrated
to
the
australian
goldfields
after
some
five
years
of
unremunerative
toil
he
returned
to
england
poor
in
pocket
but
possessing
sufficient
knowledge
of
life
to
justify
his
adoption
of
a
literary
career
his
first
attempt
and
perhaps
his
most
successful
was
the
recollections
of
geoffry
hamlyn
published
in
which
was
based
largely
on
his
own
experiences
in
australia
from
that
time
until
his
death
on
may
some
nineteen
stories
flowed
in
quick
succession
from
his
pen
none
of
them
however
reaching
the
high
standard
of
his
first
two
geoffry
hamlyn
and
ravenshoe
in
kingsley
became
editor
of
the
edinburgh
daily
review
and
on
the
outbreak
of
the
war
represented
that
paper
at
the
front
he
was
present
at
the
battle
of
sedan
and
was
the
first
englishman
to
enter
the
town
afterwards
in
a
devonshire
the
twilight
of
a
winter
evening
was
fast
falling
into
night
and
old
john
thornton
sat
dozing
by
the
fire
his
face
looked
worn
and
aged
and
anyone
might
see
the
old
man
was
unhappy
what
could
there
be
to
vex
him
not
poverty
at
all
events
for
not
a
year
ago
a
relation
had
left
him
and
a
like
sum
to
his
daughter
mary
and
his
sister
a
quiet
good
old
maid
had
come
to
live
with
him
so
that
now
he
was
comfortably
off
and
had
with
him
the
only
two
relations
he
cared
about
to
make
his
old
age
happy
his
daughter
mary
a
beautiful
girl
merry
impetuous
and
thoughtless
was
standing
at
the
window
the
white
gate
swings
on
its
hinges
and
a
tall
man
comes
with
rapid
eager
steps
up
the
walk
the
maid
bringing
in
candles
announces
george
hawker
as
the
light
fell
on
him
any
man
or
woman
might
have
exclaimed
instantly
and
with
justice
what
a
handsome
fellow
handsome
he
was
without
doubt
and
yet
the
more
you
looked
at
him
the
less
you
liked
him
the
thin
lips
the
everlasting
smile
the
quick
suspicious
glance
were
fearfully
repulsive
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
small
farmer
in
one
of
the
outlying
hamlets
of
drumston
his
mother
had
died
when
he
was
very
young
and
he
had
had
little
education
and
strange
stories
were
in
circulation
about
that
lonely
farmhouse
not
much
to
the
credit
of
father
or
son
which
stories
john
thornton
must
in
his
position
of
clergyman
have
heard
somewhat
of
so
that
one
need
hardly
wonder
at
his
uneasiness
when
he
saw
him
enter
for
mary
thornton
adored
him
the
rest
of
the
village
disliked
and
mistrusted
him
but
she
with
a
strange
perversity
loved
him
with
her
whole
heart
and
soul
after
a
few
words
the
lovers
were
whispering
in
the
window
presently
the
gate
goes
again
and
another
footfall
is
heard
approaching
that
is
james
stockbridge
i
should
know
that
step
in
a
thousand
as
he
entered
the
parlour
john
face
grew
bright
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
him
but
he
got
rather
a
cool
reception
from
the
pair
at
the
window
old
john
and
he
were
as
father
and
son
and
sat
there
before
the
cheerful
blaze
smoking
their
pipes
how
are
your
southdowns
looking
jim
says
the
vicar
how
is
scapegrace
hamlyn
he
is
very
well
sir
he
and
i
are
thinking
of
selling
up
and
going
to
new
south
wales
the
vicar
was
knocked
all
of
a
heap
at
jim
announcement
but
recovering
a
little
said
you
hear
him
he
is
going
to
sell
his
estate
acres
of
the
best
land
in
devon
and
go
and
live
among
the
convicts
and
who
is
going
with
him
hamlyn
the
wise
oh
dear
me
and
what
is
he
going
for
that
was
a
question
apparently
hard
to
answer
yet
i
think
the
real
cause
was
standing
there
with
a
look
of
unbounded
astonishment
upon
her
pretty
face
going
to
leave
us
james
she
cried
why
whatever
shall
i
do
without
you
yes
miss
mary
said
james
huskily
i
think
i
may
say
we
settled
to
go
hamlyn
has
got
a
letter
from
a
cousin
of
his
who
is
making
a
fortune
and
besides
i
got
tired
of
the
old
place
somehow
lately
time
went
on
and
may
was
well
advanced
that
had
at
last
reached
the
vicar
ears
which
had
driven
him
to
risk
a
quarrel
with
his
daughter
and
forbid
george
hawker
the
house
george
went
home
one
evening
and
found
madge
the
gipsy
woman
who
had
brought
him
up
sitting
before
the
kitchen
fire
well
old
woman
where
the
old
man
away
at
colyton
fair
she
answered
i
hope
he
have
the
sense
to
stay
there
he
fall
off
his
horse
coming
home
drunk
one
night
and
be
found
dead
in
a
ditch
good
thing
for
you
if
he
was
maybe
said
george
but
i
be
sorry
for
him
too
he

a
good
father
to
you
george
and
i
like
you
for
speaking
up
for
him
he
an
awful
old
rascal
my
boy
but
you
be
a
worse
if
you
live
now

that
madge
i
want
your
help
old
girl

and
you
get

my
pretty
boy

over
the
fire
and
whisper
in
my
ear
lad
madge
old
girl
he
whispered
i
wrote
the
old
man
name
where
i
ought
to
have
done
what
again
she
answered
three
times
for
god
sake
george
mind
what
you
at
why
you
must
be
mad
what
this
last
why
the
five
hundred
i
only
did
it
twice
you
must
do
it
again
george
he
likes
you
best
of
anything
next
his
money
and
sometimes
i
think
he
would
spare
you
if
he
knew
he
been
robbed
you
might
make
yourself
safe
for
any
storm
if
you
liked
how
marry
that
little
doll
thornton
and
get
her
money
well
said
george
i
am
pushing
that
on
the
old
man
wo
come
round
and
i
want
her
to
go
off
with
me
but
she
ca
get
up
her
courage
yet
but
in
a
few
days
mary
had
consented
they
had
left
the
village
at
midnight
and
were
married
in
london
within
a
year
george
hawker
had
spent
all
his
wife
money
and
had
told
her
to
her
face
he
was
tired
of
her
he
fell
from
bad
to
worse
and
finally
becoming
the
ally
of
a
coiner
was
arrested
and
transported
for
life
mary
hawker
with
a
baby
tramped
her
way
home
to
the
village
she
had
left
a
general
the
vicar
had
only
slowly
recovered
from
the
fit
in
which
he
had
fallen
on
the
morning
of
mary
departure
to
find
himself
hopelessly
paralytic
when
mary
letter
written
just
after
her
marriage
came
it
was
a
great
relief
they
had
kept
from
him
all
knowledge
of
george
hawker
forgery
which
had
been
communicated
to
them
by
major
buckley
old
john
thornton
very
good
friend
and
near
neighbour
but
george
hawker
burnt
the
loving
letters
they
wrote
in
reply
and
mary
remained
under
the
impression
that
they
had
cast
her
off
so
when
one
bright
sunday
morning
old
miss
thornton
found
a
poor
woman
sitting
on
the
doorstep
mary
rose
prepared
to
ask
forgiveness
her
aunt
rushed
forward
wildly
and
hugged
her
to
her
honest
heart
when
they
were
quieted
miss
thornton
went
up
to
tell
the
vicar
the
poor
old
man
was
far
gone
beyond
feeling
joy
or
grief
to
any
great
extent
mary
looking
in
saw
he
was
so
altered
she
hardly
knew
him
the
good
news
soon
got
up
to
major
buckley
and
he
was
seen
striding
up
the
path
leading
the
pony
carrying
his
wife
and
child
while
they
were
still
busy
welcoming
mary
came
a
ring
at
the
door
who
but
her
cousin
tom
troubridge
who
else
was
there
to
raise
her
four
good
feet
from
the
floor
and
call
her
his
darling
little
sister
this
was
her
welcome
home
to
the
home
she
had
dreaded
to
come
to
where
she
had
meant
to
come
only
as
a
penitent
to
leave
her
child
and
go
forth
to
die
after
dinner
buckley
told
mary
all
the
news
how
her
husband
had
heard
from
stockbridge
how
he
and
hamlyn
were
so
flourishing
and
had
written
such
an
account
of
the
country
that
major
buckley
half
persuaded
before
had
now
made
up
his
mind
to
go
there
himself
and
tom
troubridge
was
much
inclined
to
go
too
mary
was
sad
to
think
of
losing
them
all
so
soon
but
buckley
pointed
out
her
father
state
gently
to
her
and
asked
her
to
think
what
she
would
do
when
he
was
gone
miss
thornton
said
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
go
wherever
mary
went
if
it
were
to
the
other
end
of
the
earth
scarcely
more
than
a
week
had
passed
when
another
messenger
came
to
old
john
thornton
and
one
so
peremptory
that
he
rose
and
followed
it
in
the
dead
of
night
it
was
two
months
yet
before
the
major
intended
to
sail
and
long
before
they
had
passed
mary
and
miss
thornton
had
determined
to
cast
in
their
lot
with
the
others
and
cross
the
sea
towards
a
more
hopeful
land
the
new
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
all
creation
is
new
and
strange
the
trees
the
graceful
shrubs
the
flowers
ay
the
very
grass
itself
are
of
species
unknown
in
europe
while
flaming
lories
and
brilliant
paroquets
fly
whistling
through
the
gloomy
forest
and
overhead
countless
cockatoos
wheel
and
scream
in
noisy
joy
as
we
may
see
the
gulls
do
in
england
we
are
in
australia
three
hundred
and
fifty
miles
south
of
sydney
on
the
great
watershed
which
divides
the
belloury
from
the
maryburnong
as
the
sun
was
going
down
james
stockbridge
and
i
geoffry
hamlyn
reined
up
our
horses
and
gazed
down
the
long
gully
at
our
feet
for
five
days
we
had
been
passing
from
run
to
run
making
inquiries
about
some
cattle
we
had
lost
and
were
now
fifty
long
miles
from
home
at
this
time
stockbridge
and
i
had
been
settled
in
our
new
home
about
two
years
and
were
beginning
to
get
comfortable
and
settled
we
had
had
but
little
trouble
with
the
blacks
and
having
taken
possession
of
a
fine
piece
of
country
were
flourishing
and
i
dismounted
to
set
right
some
strap
or
other
and
stood
looking
at
the
prospect
glad
to
ease
my
legs
for
a
time
cramped
with
many
hours
riding
stockbridge
sat
immovable
and
silent
as
a
statue
and
i
saw
that
his
heart
travelled
farther
than
his
eye
could
reach
jim
said
i
i
wonder
what
is
going
on
at
drumston
now
i
wonder
he
said
softly
jim
i
began
again
do
you
ever
think
of
poor
little
mary
now
yes
old
boy
i
do
he
replied
i
was
thinking
of
her
then
i
am
always
thinking
of
her
i
wonder
if
she
married
that
fellow
hawker
i
fear
there
but
little
doubt
of
it
i
said
try
to
forget
her
james
you
make
all
your
life
unhappy
if
you
do
he
laughed
that
all
very
well
jeff
but
it
easier
said
than
done
do
you
hear
that
there
are
cattle
down
the
gully
there
was
some
noise
in
the
air
beside
the
evening
rustle
of
the
south
wind
among
the
now
it
sounded
like
a
hubbub
of
waters
now
swelled
up
harmonious
like
the
booming
of
cathedral
bells
across
some
rich
old
english
valley
on
a
still
summer
afternoon
i
tell
you
what
i
think
it
is
old
jeff
it
some
new
chums
going
to
cross
the
watershed
and
look
for
new
country
to
the
south
let
us
go
down
to
meet
them
they
will
come
down
by
the
river
yonder
all
doubt
about
what
the
newcomers
were
was
solved
before
we
reached
the
river
so
we
sat
and
watched
the
scene
so
venerable
and
ancient
the
patriarchs
moving
into
the
desert
to
find
new
first
came
the
cattle
lowing
loudly
then
horsemen
six
or
seven
in
number
and
last
four
drays
came
crawling
up
the
pass
suddenly
james
dashed
forward
with
a
shout
and
when
i
came
up
with
him
wondering
i
found
myself
shaking
hands
talking
and
laughing
with
major
buckley
and
tom
troubridge
they
told
us
all
the
news
as
we
rode
with
them
to
the
drays
where
sat
buckley
a
noble
happy
matron
laughing
at
her
son
as
he
toddled
about
busy
gathering
sticks
for
the
fire
beside
her
sat
mary
looking
sad
and
worn
with
her
child
on
her
lap
and
poor
old
miss
thornton
glancing
uneasily
round
mary
sprang
up
burst
into
hysterical
weeping
i
saw
how
his
big
heart
yearned
to
comfort
his
old
sweetheart
in
her
distress
as
he
took
the
child
of
his
rival
to
his
bosom
is
nobody
going
to
notice
me
or
my
boy
i
wonder
said
buckley
come
here
immediately
stockbridge
before
we
quarrel
soon
we
were
all
restored
to
our
equanimity
and
laying
plans
for
future
meetings
next
morning
with
many
hearty
farewells
and
having
promised
to
spend
christmastide
with
them
i
turned
my
horse
homewards
and
went
my
solitary
way
jim
was
going
on
with
them
to
see
them
settled
father
and
there
is
a
long
period
of
dull
prosperity
coming
to
our
friends
go
on
two
years
see
baroona
the
buckley
place
now
that
hut
where
we
spent
the
pleasant
is
degraded
into
the
kitchen
for
a
new
house
is
built
a
long
low
house
with
deep
cool
verandas
all
round
already
festooned
with
passion
flowers
and
young
mary
and
miss
thornton
had
stayed
with
the
buckleys
till
good
cousin
tom
had
got
a
house
ready
for
them
a
charming
house
covered
with
creepers
and
backed
by
huts
and
all
the
usual
concomitants
of
a
flourishing
australian
this
is
toonarbin
where
mary
hawker
is
living
with
her
son
charles
as
happy
and
uninteresting
an
existence
as
ever
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
handsome
woman
yet
the
old
dark
days
seem
like
a
bad
dream
she
had
heard
of
her
husband
and
life
sentence
finally
death
and
george
hawker
is
as
one
who
has
never
lived
so
sixteen
years
rolled
peacefully
away
until
tom
troubridge
returned
from
a
journey
up
country
with
news
of
a
great
gang
of
bushrangers
being
out
he
had
actually
sat
with
the
captain
in
a
public
house
without
knowing
it
but
his
servant
william
lee
an
knew
him
and
told
them
that
the
great
captain
tonan
with
whose
crimes
the
whole
country
was
ringing
was
george
hawker
himself
mary
terrible
fear
that
father
and
son
might
meet
made
her
ill
and
delirious
for
weeks
tom
and
his
trusty
servant
kept
watch
then
heard
from
a
passing
that
the
gang
had
been
utterly
obliterated
by
captain
desborough
the
chief
of
police
but
the
captain
had
escaped
things
went
on
quietly
for
two
months
and
no
one
thought
about
bushrangers
but
mary
at
her
watch
up
at
the
lonely
forest
station
till
one
morning
lee
body
was
found
dead
in
his
hut
with
a
pistol
lying
near
with
hawker
scratched
upon
it
a
messenger
was
sent
post
haste
to
fetch
desborough
and
his
troopers
who
came
declared
the
country
in
a
state
of
siege
and
kept
us
all
staying
at
major
buckley
we
were
sitting
merrily
over
our
wine
one
day
when
hasty
steps
came
through
the
house
the
bushrangers
had
attacked
a
station
not
far
off
killed
the
owner
and
were
now
riding
towards
captain
brentford
the
major
nearest
neighbour
and
old
friend
captain
desborough
rose
with
deadly
wrath
in
his
face
the
laughing
irishman
was
gone
and
a
stern
gloomy
man
stood
in
his
place
but
the
villains
had
done
their
work
of
destruction
before
we
reached
garoopm
and
gone
off
to
the
mountains
we
shall
have
them
in
the
morning
said
desborough
more
particularly
as
they
have
in
their
drunken
madness
hampered
themselves
in
the
mountains
we
started
before
daybreak
each
man
of
us
armed
with
swords
and
pistols
and
every
man
knew
the
use
of
his
weapons
well
as
we
entered
the
mouth
of
the
glen
to
which
we
were
bound
one
of
the
most
beautiful
gullies
i
have
ever
seen
i
turned
to
the
man
beside
me
conceive
my
horror
at
finding
it
was
charles
hawker
i
said
fiercely
get
back
charles
go
home
you
do
know
what
you
doing
lad
he
defied
me
i
was
speaking
to
him
again
when
there
came
a
puff
of
smoke
from
the
rocks
overhead
and
down
i
went
head
over
heels
a
bullet
grazed
my
thigh
and
killed
my
horse
so
that
during
the
fight
that
followed
i
was
sitting
on
a
rock
very
sick
and
very
stupid
they
set
a
watch
said
captain
desborough
they
fight
us
now
they
ca
help
it
thank
god
then
under
the
beetling
crags
the
bushrangers
turned
like
hunted
wolves
and
stood
at
bay
now
the
fight
became
general
and
confused
all
about
among
the
ferns
and
flowers
men
fought
and
fired
and
cursed
shots
were
cracking
on
all
sides
and
two
riderless
horses
were
galloping
about
neighing
desborough
fought
neither
against
small
nor
great
but
only
against
one
man
george
hawker
him
he
had
sworn
he
would
bring
home
alive
or
dead
he
caught
sight
of
his
quarry
and
instantly
made
towards
him
as
soon
as
hawker
saw
he
was
recognised
he
made
to
the
left
trying
to
reach
the
only
practicable
way
back
to
the
mountains
they
fired
at
one
another
without
effect
as
the
ground
got
more
open
desborough
was
aware
of
one
who
came
charging
recklessly
up
alongside
of
him
and
recognised
charley
hawker
he
had
had
no
hint
of
the
relationship
good
lad
he
said
come
on
i
must
have
that
fellow
before
us
the
of
the
lot
we
must
have
him
we
have
him
safe
enough
said
charles
push
to
the
left
captain
and
we
shall
get
him
among
these
fallen
rocks
they
pushed
forwards
and
soon
succeeded
in
bringing
him
to
bay
alas
too
well
he
reined
up
when
he
saw
escape
was
impossible
and
awaited
their
coming
desborough
horse
received
a
bullet
in
the
chest
and
down
went
horse
and
man
together
but
charles
pushed
on
till
within
ten
yards
of
the
bushranger
and
levelled
his
pistol
to
fire
for
an
instant
father
and
son
glared
on
one
another
as
the
father
made
his
aim
more
deadly
the
bullet
sped
and
the
poor
boy
tumbled
from
his
saddle
clutching
wildly
at
the
grass
and
flowers
shot
through
the
chest
then
ere
desborough
had
disentangled
himself
from
his
fallen
horse
george
hawker
rode
off
laughing
out
through
the
upper
rock
walls
into
the
presence
of
the
broad
that
rolled
above
his
head
in
endless
lofty
tiers
and
made
for
the
broader
valley
which
stretched
beyond
there
was
no
pursuit
he
thought
how
could
there
be
who
knew
of
this
route
but
he
and
his
mates
no
creature
was
stirring
but
he
must
onwards
onwards
across
the
snow
twilight
and
then
night
and
still
the
snow
but
half
passed
strange
ghosts
and
fancies
crowd
in
upon
him
thick
and
fast
morning
and
the
pale
ghosts
have
departed
he
reached
the
gully
where
his
refuge
lay
utterly
dispirited
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
he
turned
a
sharp
angle
round
an
abrupt
cliff
he
saw
a
horseman
within
ten
yards
of
him
captain
desborough
holding
a
pistol
to
his
head
hungry
cold
desperate
unarmed
his
pistols
had
gone
with
his
horse
over
a
precipice
he
threw
up
his
arms
and
was
instantly
chained
fast
to
desborough
saddle
only
to
be
loosed
he
knew
by
the
gallows
without
a
word
on
either
side
they
began
their
terrible
journey
they
had
gone
two
or
three
miles
before
hawker
said
that
young
fellow
i
shot
when
you
were
after
me
is
he
dead
by
this
time
said
desborough
he
was
dying
as
i
came
away
would
you
mind
stopping
for
a
moment
captain
now
tell
me
who
was
he
charles
hawker
son
of
hawker
of
toonarbin
desborough
told
me
his
wild
despairing
cry
rang
in
his
ears
for
years
afterwards
one
wild
dreary
day
in
spring
major
buckley
and
i
were
admitted
to
the
condemned
cell
in
the
gaol
in
sydney
before
us
was
a
kind
of
bed
place
on
it
lay
a
man
with
his
face
buried
in
the
pillow
i
advanced
towards
him
but
the
governor
held
me
back
my
god
sir
he
said
take
care
do
as
you
value
your
life
go
within
length
of
his
chain
the
handsome
head
was
raised
and
my
eyes
met
george
hawker
i
could
not
see
the
fierce
desperate
villain
who
had
kept
our
in
terror
so
long
i
could
only
see
the
handsome
boy
who
used
to
play
with
james
stockbridge
and
myself
in
drumston
churchyard
and
seeing
him
and
him
only
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
put
my
arm
round
his
neck
i
do
want
to
be
instructed
in
my
duty
my
duty
as
a
magistrate
was
to
stand
at
the
farther
end
of
the
cell
and
give
this
hardened
criminal
a
moral
lecture
but
i
only
hung
there
with
my
arm
round
his
neck
and
said
oh
george
george
like
a
fool
he
put
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
looked
me
in
the
face
and
said
after
a
time
what
hamlyn
old
jeff
hamlyn
jeff
old
boy
i
to
be
hung
i
know
it
i
said
and
i
came
to
ask
if
i
could
do
anything
for
you
anything
you
like
old
jeff
he
said
with
a
laugh
so
long
as
you
do
get
me
reprieved
i
murdered
my
own
son
jeff
do
you
know
that
i
answered
yes
i
know
that
george
but
you
did
not
know
who
he
was
he
came
at
me
to
take
my
life
said
hawker
and
i
tell
you
if
i
had
guessed
who
he
was
i
have
blown
my
brains
out
to
save
him
from
the
crime
of
killing
me
the
major
came
forward
and
held
out
his
hand
to
george
hawker
and
asked
him
to
forgive
him
he
had
been
his
enemy
since
they
first
met
let
me
tell
you
major
i
feel
more
kind
and
hearty
towards
you
and
hamlyn
for
coming
to
me
like
this
than
i
felt
towards
any
man
this
twenty
years
time
up
i
see
i
ai
so
much
of
a
coward
am
i
jeff
old
lad
that
was
the
last
we
saw
of
him
the
next
morning
he
was
executed
with
four
of
his
comrades
after
all
this
we
old
folks
taking
up
our
residence
at
baroona
had
agreed
to
make
common
house
of
it
we
were
very
dull
at
first
but
i
remember
many
pleasant
evenings
when
we
played
whist
and
mary
hawker
in
her
widow
weeds
sat
sewing
by
the
fireside
contentedly
enough
but
one
evening
next
spring
in
stalked
tom
troubridge
and
in
short
he
took
her
off
with
him
and
they
were
married
and
i
think
i
never
saw
a
couple
more
sincerely
attached
than
she
and
her
husband
ravenshoe
ravenshoe
was
henry
kingsley
second
novel
and
it
was
published
in
when
its
author
was
years
old
it
will
always
rank
with
geoffry
hamlyn
as
henry
best
work
these
two
books
were
their
author
favourites
among
his
own
novels
and
charles
ravenshoe
was
one
of
his
two
favourite
characters
it
has
been
said
that
ravenshoe
is
alive
the
expression
of
a
man
who
worked
both
with
heart
and
brain
and
few
would
care
to
dispute
that
opinion
for
study
of
character
wide
charity
of
outlook
brilliant
descriptive
writing
as
for
instance
in
the
charge
at
balaclava
and
real
not
mawkish
pathos
as
in
the
hopeless
misery
of
charles
invalided
with
only
eighteen
shillings
out
of
the
army
ravenshoe
will
always
deserve
to
be
read
it
is
the
work
of
a
writer
who
was
not
ashamed
to
avow
himself
an
optimist
charles
loses
his
brother
and
his
in
densil
lost
both
his
father
and
mother
and
found
himself
at
the
age
of
master
of
ravenshoe
an
estate
worth
a
year
and
master
of
himself
densil
was
an
only
son
his
father
peter
ravenshoe
had
married
alicia
daughter
of
charles
earl
of
ascot
the
ravenshoes
an
old
west
of
england
family
were
catholics
but
densil
second
wife
his
first
wife
died
childless
in
was
a
protestant
and
made
her
husband
promise
that
all
her
children
after
her
first
born
should
be
brought
up
protestant
ravenshoe
bore
densil
two
sons
cuthbert
born
charles
born
on
the
night
charles
was
born
his
mother
lay
dying
and
densil
swore
to
her
he
would
keep
the
promise
he
had
made
and
to
this
vow
he
was
faithful
in
spite
of
the
indignation
of
father
mackworth
the
resident
catholic
priest
at
ravenshoe
the
doctor
insisted
that
a
nurse
was
an
immediate
necessity
and
james
horton
densil
devoted
servant
and
head
keeper
suggested
his
wife
norah
a
proposal
that
had
the
doctor
immediate
approval
in
due
time
charles
went
to
eton
and
to
oxford
where
he
was
rusticated
for
a
term
with
his
friend
lord
welter
lord
ascot
eldest
son
and
fell
in
love
with
adelaide
a
penniless
young
lady
who
acted
as
companion
to
old
lady
ascot
at
ravenshoe
charles
and
mackworth
seldom
met
without
a
sparring
match
for
to
the
priest
it
was
intolerable
that
this
house
should
in
the
event
of
cuthbert
dying
childless
pass
into
protestant
hands
on
the
other
hand
it
was
natural
that
a
considerable
amount
of
familiarity
and
a
most
sincere
and
hearty
affection
should
exist
between
charles
and
his
servant
and
william
horton
till
charles
went
to
shrewsbury
he
had
never
had
another
playfellow
for
his
brother
cuthbert
was
reserved
and
bookish
and
the
friendship
between
the
two
had
grown
with
age
one
other
inmate
of
ravenshoe
must
be
mentioned
this
was
little
mary
corby
who
was
saved
miraculously
from
the
wreck
of
the
warren
hastings
when
charles
was
about
ten
she
was
the
daughter
of
captain
corby
and
when
the
ship
went
down
in
fifteen
fathoms
of
water
the
mate
assisted
by
fishermen
and
encouraged
by
densil
managed
to
get
the
little
girl
to
shore
and
to
ravenshoe
for
the
house
was
not
far
from
the
cliffs
in
spite
of
densil
letters
and
inquiries
no
friends
came
forward
to
claim
little
mary
then
a
child
of
nine
and
in
three
months
she
was
considered
as
a
permanent
member
of
the
household
and
the
night
before
charles
went
to
school
he
told
her
of
his
grand
passion
for
adelaide
on
the
day
of
the
oxford
and
cambridge
when
charles
rowed
three
in
the
winning
boat
densil
ravenshoe
died
after
two
illness
old
james
horton
death
occurred
at
the
same
time
charles
hurried
home
in
time
for
the
funeral
and
when
all
was
over
a
servant
came
up
to
him
and
asked
him
would
he
see
ravenshoe
in
the
library
charles
entered
the
library
with
william
who
had
also
been
sent
for
charles
went
up
silently
and
kissed
his
brother
on
the
forehead
for
a
few
minutes
cuthbert
neither
moved
nor
spoke
while
charles
greeted
mackworth
civilly
william
stood
at
a
little
distance
looking
uneasily
from
one
to
another
cuthbert
broke
the
silence
and
as
he
spoke
charles
by
some
instinct
laid
his
hand
on
william
shoulder
i
sent
for
you
he
said
on
business
which
must
be
gone
through
with
though
i
expect
it
will
kill
me
i
should
like
to
prepare
you
for
what
is
to
come
but
the
blow
would
be
equally
severe
whether
you
expect
it
or
not
you
two
who
stand
there
were
nursed
at
the
same
breast
that
groom
on
whose
shoulder
you
have
your
hand
now
is
my
real
brother
you
are
no
relation
to
me
you
are
the
son
of
the
faithful
old
servant
whom
we
buried
with
my
father
charles
at
once
asked
for
proofs
and
witnesses
and
mackworth
took
up
the
tale
your
mother
was
norah
james
horton
wife
james
horton
was
densil
ravenshoe
and
the
illegitimate
son
of
peter
she
confessed
to
me
the
wicked
fraud
she
practised
and
has
committed
that
confession
to
paper
i
hold
it
you
have
not
a
point
of
ground
to
stand
on
you
have
been
living
in
luxury
and
receiving
an
expensive
education
when
you
should
have
been
cleaning
out
the
stable
charles
heart
died
away
within
him
cuthbert
he
said
you
are
a
gentleman
is
this
true
god
knows
how
terribly
true
it
is
said
cuthbert
quietly
father
mackworth
handed
the
paper
signed
by
his
mother
to
him
and
charles
read
it
it
was
completely
conclusive
william
also
read
it
and
turned
pale
cuthbert
spoke
again
in
his
quiet
passionless
voice
my
intention
he
said
is
to
make
a
provision
of
a
year
for
this
gentleman
whom
till
the
last
few
days
i
believed
to
be
my
brother
less
than
hours
ago
charles
i
offered
father
mackworth
for
this
paper
with
a
view
to
destroying
it
you
see
what
a
poor
weak
rogue
i
am
and
what
a
criminal
i
might
become
with
a
little
temptation
father
mackworth
did
his
duty
and
refused
me
you
acted
like
yourself
cuthbert
like
one
who
would
risk
body
and
soul
for
one
you
loved
but
it
is
time
that
this
scene
should
end
i
utterly
refuse
the
assistance
so
nobly
offered
i
go
forth
alone
into
the
world
to
make
my
own
way
or
to
be
forgotten
it
only
remains
to
say
i
leave
this
house
without
a
hard
thought
towards
any
one
in
it
i
am
at
peace
with
all
the
world
father
mackworth
i
beg
your
forgiveness
i
have
often
been
rude
and
brutal
to
you
he
shook
hands
with
mackworth
then
with
william
and
lastly
he
went
up
to
cuthbert
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
and
then
walked
out
of
the
door
into
the
hall
i
am
going
to
follow
him
wherever
he
goes
said
william
if
he
goes
to
the
world
end
i
will
be
with
him
charles
loses
charles
fled
from
ravenshoe
for
london
in
the
middle
of
the
night
determined
that
william
should
not
follow
him
but
he
could
not
bear
to
go
out
and
seek
fortune
without
seeing
adelaide
so
he
called
at
ranford
lord
ascot
seat
only
to
learn
that
adelaide
had
eloped
with
lord
welter
the
two
were
married
when
he
afterwards
saw
them
in
london
charles
had
to
tell
his
story
to
old
lady
ascot
and
when
he
had
gone
she
said
to
herself
i
will
never
keep
another
secret
after
this
it
was
for
alicia
sake
and
for
peter
that
i
did
it
and
now
see
what
has
become
of
me
in
london
charles
ravenshoe
committed
suicide
deliberately
he
did
not
hang
himself
or
drown
himself
he
hired
himself
out
as
groom
being
perfectly
accomplished
in
everything
relating
to
horses
to
lieutenant
hornby
of
the
hussars
and
when
the
crimean
war
broke
out
enlisted
under
the
name
of
simpson
as
a
trooper
in
hornby
regiment
on
october
charles
was
at
balaclava
they
went
down
hill
straight
towards
the
guns
and
almost
at
once
the
shot
from
them
began
to
tell
charles
was
in
the
second
line
and
the
men
in
the
front
line
began
to
fall
terribly
fast
as
they
rode
into
the
narrowing
valley
it
was
impossible
to
keep
line
presently
the
batteries
right
and
left
opened
on
them
and
those
who
were
there
engaged
can
give
us
very
little
idea
of
what
followed
in
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
they
were
soon
among
the
guns
the
very
guns
that
had
annoyed
them
from
the
first
and
charles
and
two
or
three
others
known
to
him
were
hunting
some
russian
artillerymen
round
these
guns
for
a
minute
or
so
he
saw
also
at
this
time
a
friend
of
his
a
cornet
on
foot
and
rode
to
his
assistance
he
caught
a
riderless
horse
and
the
cornet
mounted
then
the
word
was
given
to
get
back
again
and
as
they
turned
their
faces
to
get
out
of
this
terrible
hell
poor
charles
gave
a
short
sharp
scream
and
bent
down
in
his
saddle
over
his
horse
neck
it
was
nothing
it
was
only
as
if
one
were
to
have
twenty
teeth
pulled
out
at
once
the
pain
was
over
in
an
instant
his
left
arm
seemed
nearly
dead
but
he
could
hold
his
reins
in
a
way
he
saw
hornby
before
him
and
his
own
friends
were
beside
him
again
and
there
was
a
rally
and
a
charge
at
guns
no
at
men
this
time
russian
hussars
right
valiant
fellows
too
he
could
do
but
little
himself
he
rode
at
a
russian
and
unhorsed
him
he
remembers
seeing
the
man
go
down
they
beat
them
back
and
then
turned
and
rode
for
it
was
time
as
the
noise
of
the
battle
grew
fainter
behind
them
he
looked
around
to
see
who
was
riding
beside
him
and
holding
him
by
the
right
arm
it
was
the
little
cornet
charles
wondered
why
he
did
so
you
hard
hit
simpson
said
the
cornet
never
mind
keep
your
saddle
a
little
longer
we
shall
be
all
right
directly
charles
looked
down
and
noticed
that
his
left
arm
was
hanging
numbed
by
his
side
and
that
a
trooper
was
guiding
his
horse
soon
they
were
among
english
faces
and
english
cheers
rang
out
in
welcome
to
their
return
but
it
was
nothing
to
him
he
kept
his
eye
which
was
growing
dim
on
hornby
and
when
he
saw
him
fall
off
his
saddle
into
the
arms
of
a
trooper
he
dismounted
too
and
staggered
towards
him
the
world
seemed
to
go
round
and
round
and
he
felt
about
him
like
a
blind
man
but
he
found
hornby
somehow
presently
a
doctor
was
bending
over
him
later
they
found
hornby
dead
and
cold
with
his
head
on
charles
lap
charles
had
been
struck
by
a
ball
in
the
bone
of
his
arm
and
the
splinters
were
driven
into
the
flesh
though
the
arm
was
not
broken
it
was
a
nasty
business
said
the
doctors
all
sorts
of
things
might
happen
to
him
only
one
thing
was
certain
and
that
was
that
charles
ravenshoe
career
in
the
army
was
over
for
ever
at
home
they
all
believed
him
dead
for
william
had
traced
him
to
varna
and
there
had
been
informed
that
his
had
died
of
cholera
the
change
of
name
was
partly
responsible
for
this
for
among
the
dead
or
living
there
was
no
signs
of
charles
ravenshoe
but
he
recovered
after
a
long
spell
in
the
hospital
at
scutari
and
after
a
time
was
sent
home
to
fort
pitt
but
that
mighty
left
arm
which
had
done
such
noble
work
when
it
belonged
to
no
in
the
oxford
university
eight
was
useless
and
charles
simpson
trooper
of
the
was
discharged
from
the
army
and
found
himself
on
christmas
eve
in
the
street
with
eighteen
shillings
and
ninepence
in
his
pocket
wondering
blindly
what
the
end
would
be
but
no
more
dreaming
of
begging
from
those
who
had
known
him
formerly
than
of
leaping
off
waterloo
bridge
the
last
eighteen
charles
luck
seemed
certainly
to
have
deserted
him
at
last
he
had
got
to
spend
his
christmas
with
eighteen
shillings
and
a
crippled
left
arm
and
had
nothing
left
to
trust
to
but
his
little
friend
the
cornet
who
had
come
home
invalided
and
was
living
with
his
mother
in
hyde
park
gardens
the
cornet
welcomed
him
with
both
hands
and
hearing
from
charles
of
his
plight
said
now
i
know
you
are
a
gentleman
and
i
may
offend
you
but
if
you
are
utterly
hard
up
take
service
with
me
there
i
will
do
so
with
the
deepest
gratitude
said
charles
but
i
can
not
ride
i
fear
my
left
arm
is
gone
pish
ride
with
your
right
it
a
bargain
then
charles
went
upstairs
and
was
introduced
to
the
cornet
mother
he
accepted
his
new
position
with
dull
carelessness
life
was
getting
very
worthless
and
all
this
time
had
he
but
known
it
money
and
a
home
and
sweet
little
mary
corby
who
had
loved
him
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
were
waiting
for
him
there
was
also
a
remarkable
advertisement
which
appeared
in
the
times
for
a
considerable
period
and
was
never
seen
by
charles
the
advertisement
was
inserted
by
old
lady
ascot
and
offered
one
hundred
guineas
to
any
person
who
could
discover
the
register
of
marriage
between
peter
ravenshoe
of
ravenshoe
in
the
county
of
devon
and
maria
dawson
supposed
to
have
been
solemnised
about
how
was
charles
to
know
that
cuthbert
ravenshoe
was
dead
that
william
now
master
of
ravenshoe
still
hoped
for
his
life
and
that
old
lady
ascot
was
doing
all
she
could
to
atone
for
a
mistake
charles
in
fact
was
still
very
weak
and
ill
and
served
his
friend
the
cornet
in
a
poor
way
he
had
not
recovered
the
shock
of
his
fever
and
delirium
in
the
crimea
and
both
nerve
and
health
were
gone
nobody
could
be
more
kind
and
affectionate
than
the
cornet
and
his
deaf
mother
they
guessed
that
he
was
somebody
and
that
things
were
wrong
with
him
and
the
cornet
once
or
twice
invited
his
confidence
but
he
was
too
young
and
charles
had
not
the
energy
to
tell
him
anything
and
life
was
getting
very
very
weary
business
for
charles
by
day
riding
had
become
a
terror
and
at
night
he
got
no
rest
and
his
mind
began
to
dwell
too
much
on
the
bridges
over
the
thames
and
on
the
water
lapping
and
swirling
about
the
piers
then
as
it
happened
a
little
shoeblack
with
whom
charles
had
struck
up
a
friendship
falling
sick
in
a
foul
court
in
south
london
charles
must
needs
go
and
sit
with
him
the
child
died
in
his
arms
and
a
dull
terror
came
on
charles
when
he
thought
of
his
homeward
journey
a
scripture
reader
who
had
been
in
the
room
came
towards
him
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
charles
turned
from
the
dead
child
and
looked
up
into
the
face
of
john
marston
the
best
of
his
old
oxford
friends
they
passed
out
of
the
house
together
charles
clinging
tight
to
john
marston
arms
when
they
got
to
marston
lodgings
charles
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
said
quietly
john
you
have
saved
me
i
should
never
have
got
home
this
night
but
john
marston
by
finding
charles
had
dashed
his
dearest
hopes
to
the
ground
he
had
always
loved
mary
corby
from
his
first
visit
to
ravenshoe
and
mary
loved
charles
who
had
loved
adelaide
who
had
married
lord
welter
marston
thought
there
was
just
a
chance
for
him
and
now
that
chance
was
gone
how
did
he
behave
knowing
that
he
put
his
hand
on
charles
shoulder
and
said
charles
charles
my
dear
old
boy
look
up
think
of
mary
she
has
been
wooed
by
more
than
one
but
i
think
her
heart
is
yours
yet
john
said
charles
that
is
what
has
made
me
hide
from
you
all
like
this
i
know
that
she
loved
me
above
all
men
and
partly
that
she
should
forget
a
penniless
and
disgraced
man
like
myself
and
partly
from
a
silly
pride
i
have
spent
all
my
cunning
on
losing
myself
hoping
that
you
would
believe
me
dead
we
have
hunted
you
hard
charles
you
do
not
know
i
suppose
that
you
are
a
rich
man
and
undoubtedly
heir
of
ravenshoe
though
one
link
is
still
wanting
what
do
you
mean
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
although
we
can
not
prove
it
that
your
grandfather
peter
was
married
previously
to
his
marriage
with
lady
alicia
staunton
that
your
father
james
was
the
real
ravenshoe
while
poor
cuthbert
and
william
cuthbert
i
will
hide
again
i
will
never
displace
cuthbert
mind
you
cuthbert
is
dead
he
was
drowned
bathing
last
august
charles
broke
down
and
cried
like
a
child
when
he
was
quiet
he
asked
after
william
he
is
very
well
as
he
deserves
to
be
he
gave
up
everything
to
hunt
you
through
the
world
and
bring
you
back
now
my
dear
old
boy
do
satisfy
my
curiosity
what
regiment
did
you
enlist
in
in
the
he
paused
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
then
his
speech
became
rapid
and
incoherent
at
devna
we
got
and
i
rode
the
bay
and
he
carried
me
through
it
capitally
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
but
i
am
only
a
poor
discharged
trooper
i
would
not
beg
sir
if
i
could
help
it
but
pain
and
hunger
are
hard
things
to
bear
sir
charles
charles
do
you
know
me
that
is
my
name
sir
that
is
what
they
used
to
call
me
i
am
no
common
beggar
sir
i
was
a
gentleman
once
sir
and
rode
i
was
in
the
light
cavalry
charge
at
balaclava
an
angry
business
they
get
good
fellows
to
fight
together
like
that
the
next
morning
old
lady
ascot
william
mary
and
john
marston
were
round
his
bed
listening
to
his
delirious
babble
the
anxious
question
was
put
to
the
greatest
of
the
doctors
present
my
dear
b
will
he
die
well
yes
said
the
doctor
i
would
sooner
say
than
the
chances
are
so
heavy
against
him
you
must
really
prepare
for
the
worst
a
of
course
he
did
not
die
i
need
not
tell
you
that
the
doctors
pulled
him
through
and
when
he
was
better
the
doctors
removed
the
splinters
of
bone
from
his
arm
he
did
not
talk
much
in
this
happy
quiet
time
william
and
lady
ascot
were
with
him
all
day
william
dear
fellow
used
to
sit
on
a
footstool
and
read
the
times
to
him
lord
welter
now
lord
ascot
on
the
death
of
his
father
came
to
see
charles
one
day
and
something
he
said
made
charles
ask
if
adelaide
was
dead
tell
me
something
said
lord
ascot
have
you
any
love
left
for
her
yet
not
one
spark
said
charles
if
i
ever
am
a
man
again
i
shall
ask
mary
corby
to
marry
me
i
ought
to
have
done
so
sooner
perhaps
but
i
love
your
wife
welter
in
a
way
and
i
should
grieve
at
her
death
for
i
loved
her
once
the
truth
is
very
horrible
we
went
out
hunting
together
and
i
was
getting
the
gate
open
for
her
when
her
devil
of
a
horse
rushed
it
and
down
they
came
on
it
together
and
she
broke
her
back
and
the
doctor
says
she
may
live
till
seventy
but
that
she
will
never
move
from
where
she
lies
and
just
as
i
was
getting
to
love
her
so
dearly
that
same
afternoon
charles
asked
william
to
get
mary
to
come
and
see
him
and
william
straightway
departed
and
found
mary
and
later
in
the
day
miss
mary
corby
announced
that
she
and
charles
were
engaged
to
be
married
william
was
still
master
of
ravenshoe
but
he
was
convinced
that
the
first
marriage
of
his
grandfather
would
be
proved
and
charles
reinstated
remember
charles
i
am
not
spending
the
revenues
of
ravenshoe
he
said
they
are
yours
i
know
it
i
am
spending
about
a
year
when
our
grandfather
marriage
is
proved
you
will
provide
for
me
and
my
wife
i
know
that
be
quiet
william
had
long
been
engaged
from
the
time
he
had
been
servant
to
a
fisherman
daughter
jane
evans
and
the
change
in
his
fortunes
made
no
difference
in
the
matter
she
was
only
a
daughter
but
she
was
wonderfully
beautiful
and
gentle
and
good
the
weddings
took
place
at
peter
eaton
square
mary
and
charles
were
not
a
handsome
couple
the
enthusiasm
of
the
population
was
reserved
for
william
and
jane
evans
who
certainly
were
father
mackworth
dying
after
a
stroke
of
paralysis
told
us
the
date
and
place
of
peter
ravenshoe
first
marriage
finchampstead
berks
he
had
known
the
truth
but
had
been
anxious
to
keep
ravenshoe
in
catholic
hands
you
used
to
irritate
and
insult
me
sir
he
said
turning
to
charles
and
i
was
not
so
near
death
then
as
now
if
you
can
forgive
me
in
god
name
say
so
charles
went
over
to
him
and
put
his
arm
round
him
forgive
you
he
said
dear
mackworth
can
you
forgive
me
the
register
was
found
and
the
lawyers
were
soon
busy
one
document
may
be
noted
a
rent
charge
on
ravenshoe
of
two
thousand
a
year
in
favour
of
william
ravenshoe
well
charles
and
william
are
both
happily
married
now
and
i
saw
charles
last
summer
playing
with
his
eldest
boy
but
there
was
a
cloud
on
his
face
for
the
memory
of
those
few
terrible
months
has
cast
its
shadow
upon
him
and
the
shadow
will
lie
i
fancy
upon
that
forehead
until
the
forehead
is
smoothed
in
the
sleep
of
death
