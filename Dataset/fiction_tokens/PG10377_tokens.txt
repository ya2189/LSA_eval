about
sixty
years
ago
and
somewhat
more
than
twenty
miles
from
the
ancient
town
of
chester
in
a
southward
direction
there
stood
a
large
and
even
then
an
it
lay
in
the
midst
of
a
demesne
of
considerable
extent
and
richly
wooded
with
venerable
timber
but
apart
from
the
somber
majesty
of
these
giant
groups
and
the
varieties
of
the
undulating
ground
on
which
they
stood
there
was
little
that
could
be
deemed
attractive
in
the
place
a
certain
air
of
neglect
and
decay
and
an
indescribable
gloom
and
melancholy
hung
over
it
in
darkness
it
seemed
darker
than
any
other
tract
when
the
moonlight
fell
upon
its
glades
and
hollows
they
looked
spectral
and
awful
with
a
sort
of
churchyard
loneliness
and
even
when
the
blush
of
the
morning
kissed
its
broad
woodlands
there
was
a
melancholy
in
the
salute
that
saddened
rather
than
cheered
the
heart
of
the
beholder
this
antique
melancholy
and
neglected
place
we
shall
call
for
distinctness
sake
gray
forest
it
was
then
the
property
of
the
younger
son
of
a
nobleman
once
celebrated
for
his
ability
and
his
daring
but
who
had
long
since
passed
to
that
land
where
human
wisdom
and
courage
avail
naught
the
representative
of
this
noble
house
resided
at
the
family
mansion
in
sussex
and
the
cadet
whose
fortunes
we
mean
to
sketch
in
these
pages
lived
upon
the
narrow
margin
of
an
encumbered
income
in
a
reserved
and
unsocial
discontent
deep
among
the
solemn
shadows
of
the
old
woods
of
gray
forest
the
hon
richard
marston
was
now
somewhere
between
forty
and
fifty
years
of
age
perhaps
nearer
the
latter
he
still
however
retained
in
an
eminent
degree
the
traits
of
manly
beauty
not
the
less
remarkable
for
its
unquestionably
haughty
and
passionate
character
he
had
married
a
beautiful
girl
of
good
family
but
without
much
money
somewhere
about
eighteen
years
before
and
two
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
had
been
the
fruit
of
this
union
the
boy
harry
marston
was
at
this
time
at
cambridge
and
his
sister
scarcely
fifteen
was
at
home
with
her
parents
and
under
the
training
of
an
accomplished
governess
who
had
been
recommended
to
them
by
a
noble
relative
of
marston
she
was
a
native
of
france
but
thoroughly
mistress
of
the
english
language
and
except
for
a
foreign
accent
which
gave
a
certain
prettiness
to
all
she
said
she
spoke
it
as
perfectly
as
any
native
englishwoman
this
young
frenchwoman
was
eminently
handsome
and
attractive
expressive
dark
eyes
a
clear
olive
complexion
small
even
teeth
and
a
smile
more
perhaps
than
a
strictly
classic
regularity
of
features
were
the
secrets
of
her
unquestionable
influence
at
first
sight
upon
the
fancy
of
every
man
of
taste
who
beheld
her
marston
fortune
never
very
large
had
been
shattered
by
early
dissipation
naturally
of
a
proud
and
somewhat
exacting
temper
he
actively
felt
the
mortifying
consequences
of
his
poverty
the
want
of
what
he
felt
ought
to
have
been
his
position
and
influence
in
the
county
in
which
he
resided
fretted
and
galled
him
and
he
cherished
a
resentful
and
bitter
sense
of
every
slight
imaginary
or
real
to
which
the
same
fruitful
source
of
annoyance
and
humiliation
had
exposed
him
he
held
therefore
but
little
intercourse
with
the
surrounding
gentry
and
that
little
not
of
the
pleasantest
possible
kind
for
not
being
himself
in
a
condition
to
entertain
in
that
style
which
accorded
with
his
own
ideas
of
his
station
he
declined
as
far
as
was
compatible
with
good
breeding
all
the
proffered
hospitalities
of
the
neighborhood
and
from
his
wild
and
neglected
park
looked
out
upon
the
surrounding
world
in
a
spirit
of
moroseness
and
defiance
very
unlike
indeed
to
that
of
neighborly
in
the
midst
however
of
many
of
the
annoyances
attendant
upon
crippled
means
he
enjoyed
a
few
of
those
shadowy
indications
of
hereditary
importance
which
are
all
the
more
dearly
prized
as
the
substantial
accessories
of
wealth
have
disappeared
the
mansion
in
which
he
dwelt
was
though
imposing
in
its
aspect
and
upon
a
scale
unequivocally
aristocratic
its
walls
were
hung
with
ancestral
portraits
and
he
managed
to
maintain
about
him
a
large
and
tolerably
respectable
staff
of
servants
in
addition
to
these
he
had
his
extensive
demesne
his
and
his
unrivalled
timber
wherewith
to
console
himself
and
in
the
consciousness
of
these
possessions
he
found
some
imperfect
assuagement
of
those
bitter
feelings
of
suppressed
scorn
and
resentment
which
a
sense
of
lost
station
and
slighted
importance
engendered
marston
early
habits
had
unhappily
been
of
a
kind
to
aggravate
rather
than
alleviate
the
annoyances
incidental
to
reduced
means
he
had
been
a
gay
man
a
voluptuary
and
a
gambler
his
vicious
tastes
had
survived
the
means
of
their
gratification
his
love
for
his
wife
had
been
nothing
more
than
one
of
those
vehement
and
headstrong
fancies
which
in
men
sometimes
result
in
marriage
and
which
seldom
outlive
the
first
few
months
of
that
connection
marston
was
a
gentle
woman
after
agonies
or
disappointment
which
none
ever
suspected
she
had
at
length
learned
to
submit
in
sad
and
gentle
acquiescence
to
her
fate
those
feelings
which
had
been
the
charm
of
her
young
days
were
gone
and
as
she
bitterly
felt
forever
for
them
there
was
no
recall
they
could
not
return
and
without
complaint
or
reproach
she
yielded
to
what
she
felt
was
inevitable
it
was
impossible
to
look
at
marston
and
not
to
discern
at
a
glance
the
ruin
of
a
surpassingly
beautiful
woman
a
good
deal
wasted
pale
and
chastened
with
a
deep
untold
sorrow
but
still
possessing
the
outlines
both
in
face
and
form
of
that
noble
beauty
and
matchless
grace
which
had
made
her
in
happier
days
the
admired
of
all
observers
but
equally
impossible
was
it
to
converse
with
her
for
even
a
minute
without
hearing
in
the
gentle
and
melancholy
music
of
her
voice
the
sad
echoes
of
those
griefs
to
which
her
early
beauty
had
been
sacrificed
an
undying
sense
of
lost
love
and
happiness
departed
never
to
come
again
one
morning
marston
had
walked
as
was
his
custom
when
he
expected
the
messenger
who
brought
from
the
neighboring
post
office
his
letters
some
way
down
the
broad
straight
avenue
with
its
double
rows
of
lofty
trees
at
each
side
when
he
encountered
the
nimble
emissary
on
his
return
he
took
the
in
silence
it
contained
but
two
letters
one
addressed
to
mademoiselle
de
barras
chez
marston
and
the
other
to
himself
he
took
them
both
dismissed
the
messenger
and
opening
that
addressed
to
himself
read
as
follows
while
he
slowly
retraced
his
steps
towards
the
house
dear
richard
i
am
a
whimsical
fellow
as
you
doubtless
remember
and
have
lately
grown
they
tell
me
rather
hippish
besides
i
do
not
know
to
which
infirmity
i
am
to
attribute
a
sudden
fancy
that
urges
me
to
pay
you
a
visit
if
you
will
admit
me
to
say
truth
my
dear
dick
i
wish
to
see
a
little
of
your
part
of
the
world
and
i
will
confess
it
en
passant
to
see
a
little
of
you
too
i
really
wish
to
make
acquaintance
with
your
family
and
though
they
tell
me
my
health
is
very
much
shaken
i
must
say
in
i
am
not
a
troublesome
inmate
i
can
perfectly
take
care
of
myself
and
need
no
nursing
or
caudling
whatever
will
you
present
this
my
petition
to
marston
and
report
her
decision
thereon
to
me
seriously
i
know
that
your
house
may
be
full
or
some
other
contretemps
may
make
it
impracticable
for
me
just
now
to
invade
you
if
it
be
so
tell
me
my
dear
richard
frankly
as
my
movements
are
perfectly
free
and
my
time
all
my
own
so
that
i
can
arrange
my
visit
to
suit
your
convenience
yours
wynston
berkley
direct
to
me
at
hotel
in
chester
as
i
shall
probably
be
there
by
the
time
this
reaches
you
and
pushing
as
ever
quoth
marston
angrily
as
he
thrust
the
unwelcome
letter
into
his
pocket
this
fellow
wallowing
in
wealth
without
one
nearer
relative
on
earth
than
i
and
associated
more
nearly
still
with
me
the
pshaw
not
affection
the
recollections
of
early
and
intimate
companionship
leaves
me
unaided
for
years
of
desertion
and
suffering
to
the
buffetings
of
the
world
and
the
troubles
of
all
but
overwhelming
pecuniary
difficulties
and
now
with
the
cool
confidence
of
one
entitled
to
respect
and
welcome
invites
himself
to
my
house
coming
here
he
continued
after
a
gloomy
pause
and
still
pacing
slowly
towards
the
house
to
collect
amusing
materials
for
next
gossip
stories
about
the
married
benedick
the
bankrupt
beau
the
outcast
tenant
of
a
cheshire
wilderness
and
as
he
said
this
he
looked
at
the
neglected
prospect
before
him
with
an
eye
almost
of
hatred
aye
to
see
the
nakedness
of
the
land
is
he
coming
but
he
shall
be
disappointed
his
money
may
buy
him
a
cordial
welcome
at
an
inn
but
curse
me
if
it
shall
purchase
him
a
reception
here
he
again
opened
and
glanced
through
the
letter
aye
purposely
put
in
such
a
way
that
i
ca
decline
it
without
affronting
him
he
continued
doggedly
well
then
he
has
no
one
to
blame
but
himself
affronted
he
shall
be
i
shall
effectually
put
an
end
to
this
humorous
excursion
egad
it
is
rather
hard
if
a
man
can
not
keep
his
poverty
to
himself
sir
wynston
berkley
was
a
baronet
of
large
fortune
a
selfish
fashionable
man
and
an
inveterate
bachelor
he
and
marston
had
been
schoolfellows
and
the
violent
and
implacable
temper
of
the
latter
had
as
little
impressed
his
companion
with
feelings
of
regard
as
the
frivolity
and
selfishness
of
the
baronet
had
won
the
esteem
of
his
relative
as
boys
they
had
little
in
common
upon
which
to
rest
the
basis
of
a
friendship
or
even
a
mutual
liking
berkley
was
gay
cold
and
satirical
his
cousin
for
cousins
they
were
was
jealous
haughty
and
relentless
their
negative
disinclination
to
one
another
society
not
unnaturally
engendered
by
uncongenial
and
unamiable
dispositions
had
for
a
time
given
place
to
actual
hostility
while
the
two
young
men
were
at
oxford
in
some
intrigue
marston
discovered
in
his
cousin
a
rival
the
consequence
was
a
bitter
and
furious
quarrel
which
but
for
the
prompt
and
peremptory
interference
of
friends
marston
would
undoubtedly
have
pushed
to
a
bloody
issue
time
had
however
healed
this
rupture
and
the
young
men
came
to
regard
one
another
with
the
same
feelings
and
eventually
to
the
same
sort
of
cold
and
indifferent
intimacy
which
had
subsisted
between
them
before
their
angry
collision
under
these
circumstances
whatever
suspicion
marston
might
have
felt
on
the
receipt
of
the
unexpected
and
indeed
unaccountable
proposal
which
had
just
reached
him
he
certainly
had
little
reason
to
complain
of
any
violation
of
early
friendship
in
the
neglect
with
which
sir
wynston
had
hitherto
treated
him
in
deciding
to
decline
his
proposed
visit
however
marston
had
not
consulted
the
impulses
of
spite
or
anger
he
knew
the
baronet
well
he
knew
that
he
cherished
no
good
will
towards
him
and
that
in
the
project
which
he
had
thus
unexpectedly
broached
whatever
indirect
or
selfish
schemes
might
possibly
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
no
friendly
feeling
had
ever
mingled
he
was
therefore
resolved
to
avoid
the
trouble
and
the
expense
of
a
visit
in
all
respects
distasteful
to
him
and
in
a
gentlemanlike
way
but
at
the
same
time
as
the
reader
may
suppose
with
very
little
anxiety
as
to
whether
or
not
his
gay
correspondent
should
take
offence
at
his
reply
to
decline
once
for
all
the
proposed
distinction
with
this
resolution
he
entered
the
spacious
and
somewhat
dilapidated
mansion
which
called
him
master
and
entering
a
sitting
room
appropriated
to
his
daughter
use
he
found
her
there
in
company
with
her
beautiful
french
governess
he
kissed
his
child
and
saluted
her
young
preceptress
with
formal
courtesy
mademoiselle
said
he
i
have
got
a
letter
for
you
and
rhoda
he
continued
addressing
his
pretty
daughter
bring
this
to
your
mother
and
say
i
request
her
to
read
it
he
gave
her
the
letter
he
himself
had
just
received
and
the
girl
tripped
lightly
away
upon
her
mission
had
he
narrowly
scrutinised
the
countenance
of
the
fair
frenchwoman
as
she
glanced
at
the
direction
of
that
which
he
had
just
placed
in
her
hand
he
might
have
seen
certain
transient
but
very
unmistakable
evidences
of
excitement
and
agitation
she
quickly
concealed
the
letter
however
and
with
a
sigh
the
momentary
flush
which
it
had
called
to
her
cheek
subsided
and
she
was
tranquil
as
usual
marston
remained
for
some
minutes
five
eight
or
ten
we
can
not
say
precisely
pretty
much
where
he
had
stood
on
first
entering
the
chamber
doubtless
awaiting
the
return
of
his
messenger
or
the
appearance
of
his
wife
at
length
however
he
left
the
room
himself
to
seek
her
but
during
his
brief
stay
his
previous
resolution
had
been
removed
by
what
influence
we
can
not
say
but
removed
completely
it
unquestionably
was
and
a
final
determination
that
sir
wynston
berkley
should
become
his
guest
had
fixedly
taken
its
place
as
marston
walked
along
the
passages
which
led
from
this
room
he
encountered
marston
and
his
daughter
well
said
he
you
have
read
wynston
letter
yes
she
replied
returning
it
to
him
and
what
answer
richard
do
you
purpose
giving
him
she
was
about
to
hazard
a
conjecture
but
checked
herself
remembering
that
even
so
faint
an
evidence
of
a
disposition
to
advise
might
possibly
be
resented
by
her
cold
and
imperious
lord
i
have
considered
it
and
decided
to
receive
him
he
replied
ah
i
am
afraid
that
is
i
hope
he
may
find
our
housekeeping
such
as
he
can
enjoy
she
said
with
an
involuntary
expression
of
surprise
for
she
had
scarcely
had
a
doubt
that
her
husband
would
have
preferred
evading
the
visit
of
his
fine
friend
under
his
gloomy
circumstances
if
our
modest
fare
does
not
suit
him
said
marston
with
sullen
bitterness
he
can
depart
as
easily
as
he
came
we
poor
gentlemen
can
but
do
our
best
i
have
thought
it
over
and
made
up
my
mind
and
how
soon
my
dear
richard
do
you
intend
fixing
his
arrival
she
inquired
with
the
natural
uneasiness
of
one
upon
whom
in
an
establishment
whose
pretensions
considerably
exceeded
its
resources
the
perplexing
cares
of
housekeeping
devolved
why
as
soon
as
he
pleases
replied
he
i
suppose
you
can
easily
have
his
room
prepared
by
tomorrow
or
next
day
i
shall
write
by
this
mail
and
tell
him
to
come
down
at
once
having
said
this
in
a
cold
decisive
way
he
turned
and
left
her
as
it
seemed
not
caring
to
be
teased
with
further
questions
he
took
his
solitary
way
to
a
distant
part
of
his
wild
park
where
far
from
the
likelihood
of
disturbance
or
intrusion
he
was
often
wont
to
amuse
himself
for
the
day
in
the
sedentary
sport
of
shooting
rabbits
and
there
we
leave
him
for
the
present
signifying
to
the
distant
inmates
of
his
house
the
industrious
pursuit
of
his
unsocial
occupation
by
the
dropping
fire
that
sullenly
from
hour
to
hour
echoed
from
the
remote
woods
marston
issued
her
orders
and
having
set
on
foot
all
the
necessary
preparations
for
so
unwonted
an
event
as
a
stranger
visit
of
some
duration
she
betook
herself
to
her
little
boudoir
the
scene
of
many
an
hour
of
patient
but
bitter
suffering
unseen
by
human
eye
and
unknown
except
to
the
just
searcher
of
hearts
to
whom
belongs
mercy
and
vengeance
marston
had
but
two
friends
to
whom
she
had
ever
spoken
upon
the
subject
nearest
her
heart
the
estrangement
of
her
husband
a
sorrow
to
which
even
time
had
failed
to
reconcile
her
from
her
children
this
grief
was
carefully
concealed
to
them
she
never
uttered
the
semblance
of
a
complaint
anything
that
could
by
possibility
have
reflected
blame
or
dishonor
upon
their
father
she
would
have
perished
rather
than
have
allowed
them
so
much
as
to
suspect
the
two
friends
who
did
understand
her
feelings
though
in
different
degrees
were
one
a
good
and
venerable
clergyman
the
rev
doctor
danvers
a
frequent
visitor
and
occasional
guest
at
gray
forest
where
his
simple
manners
and
unaffected
benignity
and
tenderness
of
heart
had
won
the
love
of
all
with
the
exception
of
its
master
and
commanded
even
his
respect
the
second
was
no
other
than
the
young
french
governess
mademoiselle
de
barras
in
whose
ready
sympathy
and
consolatory
counsels
she
found
no
small
happiness
the
society
of
this
young
lady
had
indeed
become
next
to
that
of
her
daughter
her
greatest
comfort
and
pleasure
mademoiselle
de
barras
was
of
a
noble
though
ruined
french
family
and
a
certain
nameless
elegance
and
dignity
attested
spite
of
her
fallen
condition
the
purity
of
her
descent
she
was
accomplished
possessed
of
that
fine
perception
and
sensitiveness
and
that
ready
power
of
to
the
peculiarities
and
moods
of
others
which
we
term
tact
and
was
moreover
gifted
with
a
certain
natural
grace
and
manners
the
most
winning
imaginable
in
short
she
was
a
fascinating
companion
and
when
the
melancholy
circumstances
of
her
own
situation
and
the
sad
history
of
her
once
rich
and
noble
family
were
taken
into
account
with
her
striking
attractions
of
person
and
air
the
combination
of
all
these
associations
and
impressions
rendered
her
one
of
the
most
interesting
persons
that
could
well
be
imagined
the
circumstances
of
mademoiselle
de
barras
history
and
descent
seemed
to
warrant
on
marston
part
a
closer
intimacy
and
confidence
than
usually
subsists
between
parties
mutually
occupying
such
a
relation
marston
had
hardly
established
herself
in
this
little
apartment
when
a
light
foot
approached
a
gentle
tap
was
given
at
the
door
and
mademoiselle
de
barras
entered
ah
mademoiselle
so
kind
such
pretty
flowers
pray
sit
down
said
the
lady
with
a
sweet
and
grateful
smile
as
she
took
from
the
tapered
fingers
of
the
foreigner
the
little
bouquet
which
she
had
been
at
the
pains
to
gather
mademoiselle
sat
down
and
gently
took
the
lady
hand
and
kissed
it
a
small
matter
will
overflow
a
heart
charged
with
sorrow
a
chance
word
a
look
some
little
office
of
kindness
and
so
it
was
with
bouquet
and
gentle
kiss
marston
heart
was
touched
her
eyes
filled
with
bright
tears
she
smiled
gratefully
upon
her
fair
and
humble
companion
and
as
she
smiled
her
tears
overflowed
and
she
wept
in
silence
for
some
minutes
my
poor
mademoiselle
she
said
at
last
you
are
so
very
very
kind
mademoiselle
said
nothing
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
pressed
the
poor
lady
hand
apparently
to
interrupt
an
embarrassing
silence
and
to
give
a
more
cheerful
tone
to
their
little
interview
the
governess
in
a
gay
tone
on
a
sudden
said
and
so
madame
we
are
to
have
a
visitor
miss
rhoda
tells
me
a
baronet
is
he
not
yes
indeed
mademoiselle
sir
wynston
berkley
a
gay
london
gentleman
and
a
cousin
of
marston
she
replied
ha
a
cousin
exclaimed
the
young
lady
with
a
little
more
surprise
in
her
tone
than
seemed
altogether
called
for
a
cousin
oh
then
that
is
the
reason
of
his
visit
do
pray
madame
tell
me
all
about
him
i
am
so
much
afraid
of
strangers
and
what
you
call
men
of
the
world
oh
dear
marston
i
am
not
worthy
to
be
here
and
he
will
see
all
that
in
a
moment
indeed
indeed
i
am
afraid
pray
tell
me
all
about
him
she
said
this
with
a
simplicity
which
made
the
elder
lady
smile
and
while
mademoiselle
the
tiny
flowers
which
formed
the
bouquet
she
had
just
presented
to
her
marston
recounted
to
her
all
she
knew
of
sir
wynston
berkley
which
in
substance
amounted
to
no
more
than
we
have
already
stated
when
she
concluded
the
young
frenchwoman
continued
for
some
time
silent
still
busy
with
her
flowers
but
suddenly
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
shook
her
head
you
seem
disquieted
mademoiselle
said
marston
in
a
tone
of
kindness
i
am
thinking
madame
she
said
still
looking
upon
the
flowers
which
she
was
adjusting
and
again
sighing
profoundly
i
am
thinking
of
what
you
said
to
me
a
week
ago
alas
i
do
not
remember
what
it
was
my
good
mademoiselle
nothing
i
am
sure
that
ought
to
grieve
you
at
least
nothing
that
was
intended
to
have
that
effect
replied
the
lady
in
a
tone
of
gentle
encouragement
no
not
intended
madame
said
the
young
frenchwoman
sorrowfully
well
what
was
it
perhaps
you
misunderstood
perhaps
i
can
explain
what
i
said
replied
marston
affectionately
ah
madame
you
think
you
think
i
am
unlucky
answered
the
young
lady
slowly
and
faintly
unlucky
dear
mademoiselle
you
surprise
me
rejoined
her
companion
i
mean
what
i
mean
is
this
madame
you
date
unhappiness
if
not
its
beginning
at
least
its
great
aggravation
and
increase
she
answered
dejectedly
from
the
time
of
my
coming
here
madame
and
though
i
know
you
are
too
good
to
dislike
me
on
that
account
yet
i
must
in
your
eyes
be
ever
connected
with
calamity
and
look
like
an
ominous
thing
dear
mademoiselle
allow
no
such
thought
to
enter
your
mind
you
do
me
great
wrong
indeed
you
do
said
marston
laying
her
hand
upon
the
young
lady
kindly
there
was
a
silence
for
a
little
time
and
the
elder
lady
resumed
i
remember
now
what
you
allude
to
dear
mademoiselle
the
increased
estrangement
the
widening
separation
which
severs
me
from
one
unutterably
dear
to
me
the
first
and
bitter
disappointment
of
my
life
which
seems
to
grow
more
hopelessly
incurable
day
by
day
marston
paused
and
after
a
brief
silence
the
governess
said
i
am
very
superstitious
myself
dear
madame
and
i
thought
i
must
have
seemed
to
you
an
inauspicious
inmate
in
short
unlucky
as
i
have
said
and
the
thought
made
me
very
unhappy
so
unhappy
that
i
was
going
to
leave
you
madame
i
may
now
tell
you
frankly
going
away
but
you
have
set
my
doubts
at
rest
and
i
am
quite
happy
again
dear
mademoiselle
cried
the
lady
tenderly
and
rising
as
she
spake
to
kiss
the
cheek
of
her
humble
friend
never
never
speak
of
this
again
god
knows
i
have
too
few
friends
on
earth
to
spare
the
kindest
and
tenderest
among
them
all
no
no
you
little
think
what
comfort
i
have
found
in
your
and
ready
sympathy
and
how
dearly
i
prize
your
affection
my
poor
mademoiselle
the
young
frenchwoman
rose
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
dimpling
happy
smile
and
as
marston
drew
her
affectionately
toward
her
and
kissed
her
she
timidly
returned
the
embrace
of
her
kind
patroness
for
a
moment
her
graceful
arms
encircled
her
and
she
whispered
to
her
dear
madame
how
happy
how
very
happy
you
make
me
had
ithuriel
touched
with
his
spear
the
beautiful
young
woman
thus
for
a
moment
as
it
seemed
lost
in
a
trance
of
gratitude
and
love
would
that
angelic
form
have
stood
the
test
unscathed
a
spectator
marking
the
scene
might
have
observed
a
strange
gleam
in
her
eyes
a
strange
expression
in
her
face
an
influence
for
a
moment
not
angelic
like
a
shadow
of
some
passing
spirit
cross
her
visibly
as
she
leaned
over
the
gentle
lady
neck
and
murmured
dear
madame
how
happy
how
very
happy
you
make
me
such
a
spectator
as
he
looked
at
that
gentle
lady
might
have
seen
for
one
dreamy
moment
a
lithe
and
painted
serpent
coiled
round
and
round
and
hissing
in
her
ear
a
few
minutes
more
and
mademoiselle
was
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
apartment
she
shut
and
bolted
the
door
and
taking
from
her
desk
the
letter
which
she
had
that
morning
received
threw
herself
into
an
armchair
and
studied
the
document
profoundly
her
actual
revision
and
scrutiny
of
the
letter
itself
was
interrupted
by
long
intervals
of
profound
abstraction
and
after
a
full
hour
thus
spent
she
locked
it
carefully
up
again
and
with
a
clear
brow
and
a
gay
smile
rejoined
her
pretty
pupil
for
a
walk
we
must
now
pass
over
an
interval
of
a
few
days
and
come
at
once
to
the
arrival
of
sir
wynston
berkley
which
duly
occurred
upon
the
evening
of
the
day
appointed
the
baronet
descended
from
his
chaise
but
a
short
time
before
the
hour
at
which
the
little
party
which
formed
the
family
at
gray
forest
were
wont
to
assemble
for
the
social
meal
of
supper
a
few
minutes
devoted
to
the
mysteries
of
the
toilet
with
the
aid
of
an
accomplished
valet
enabled
him
to
appear
as
he
conceived
without
disadvantage
at
this
domestic
reunion
sir
wynston
berkley
was
a
particularly
person
he
was
rather
tall
and
elegantly
made
with
gay
easy
manners
and
something
indefinably
aristocratic
in
his
face
which
however
was
a
little
more
worn
than
his
years
would
have
strictly
accounted
for
but
sir
wynston
had
been
a
roué
and
spite
of
the
cleverest
possible
making
up
the
ravages
of
excess
were
very
traceable
in
the
lively
beau
of
fifty
perfectly
well
dressed
and
with
a
manner
that
was
ease
and
gaiety
itself
he
was
at
home
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
room
of
course
anything
like
genuine
cordiality
was
out
of
the
question
but
marston
embraced
his
relative
with
perfect
good
breeding
and
the
baronet
appeared
determined
to
like
everybody
and
be
pleased
with
everything
he
had
not
been
five
minutes
in
the
parlor
chatting
gaily
with
and
marston
and
their
pretty
daughter
when
mademoiselle
de
barras
entered
the
room
as
she
moved
towards
marston
sir
wynston
rose
and
observing
her
with
evident
admiration
said
in
an
undertone
inquiringly
to
marston
who
was
beside
him
and
this
that
is
mademoiselle
de
barras
my
daughter
governess
and
marston
companion
said
marston
drily
ha
said
sir
wynston
i
thought
you
were
but
three
at
home
just
now
and
i
was
right
your
son
is
at
cambridge
i
heard
so
from
our
old
friend
jack
manbury
jack
has
his
boy
there
too
egad
dick
it
seems
but
last
week
that
you
and
i
were
there
together
yes
said
marston
looking
gloomily
into
the
fire
as
if
he
saw
in
its
smoke
and
flicker
the
phantoms
of
murdered
time
and
opportunity
but
i
hate
looking
back
wynston
the
past
is
to
me
but
a
medley
of
and
worse
management
why
what
an
ungrateful
dog
you
are
returned
sir
wynston
gaily
turning
his
back
upon
the
fire
and
glancing
round
the
spacious
and
handsome
though
somewhat
faded
apartment
i
was
on
the
point
of
congratulating
you
on
the
possession
of
the
finest
park
and
noblest
demesne
in
cheshire
when
you
begin
to
grumble
egad
dick
all
i
can
say
to
your
complaint
is
that
i
do
pity
you
and
there
are
dozens
who
may
honestly
envy
you
that
is
all
in
spite
of
this
cheering
assurance
marston
remained
sullenly
silent
supper
however
had
now
been
served
and
the
little
party
assumed
their
places
at
the
table
i
am
sorry
wynston
i
have
no
sport
of
any
kind
to
offer
you
here
said
marston
except
indeed
some
good
if
you
like
it
i
have
three
miles
of
excellent
fishing
at
your
command
my
dear
fellow
i
am
a
mere
cockney
rejoined
sir
wynston
i
am
not
a
sportsman
i
never
tried
it
and
should
not
like
to
begin
now
no
dick
what
i
much
prefer
is
abundance
of
your
fresh
air
and
the
enjoyment
of
your
scenery
when
i
was
at
rouen
three
years
ago
ha
rouen
mademoiselle
will
feel
an
interest
in
that
it
is
her
interrupted
marston
glancing
at
the
frenchwoman
yes
rouen
ah
yes
said
mademoiselle
with
very
evident
embarrassment
sir
wynston
appeared
for
a
moment
a
little
disconcerted
too
but
rallied
speedily
and
pursued
his
detail
of
his
doings
at
that
fair
town
of
normandy
marston
knew
sir
wynston
well
and
he
rightly
calculated
that
whatever
effect
his
experience
of
the
world
might
have
had
in
intensifying
his
selfishness
or
hardening
his
heart
it
certainly
could
have
had
none
in
improving
a
character
originally
worthless
and
unfeeling
he
knew
moreover
that
his
wealthy
cousin
was
gifted
with
a
great
deal
of
that
small
cunning
which
is
available
for
masking
the
little
scheming
of
frivolous
and
worldly
men
and
that
sir
wynston
never
took
trouble
of
any
kind
without
a
sufficient
purpose
having
its
center
in
his
own
personal
gratification
this
visit
greatly
puzzled
marston
it
gave
him
even
a
vague
sense
of
uneasiness
could
there
exist
any
flaw
in
his
own
title
to
the
estate
of
gray
forest
he
had
an
unpleasant
doubtful
sort
of
remembrance
of
some
apprehensions
of
this
kind
when
he
was
but
a
child
having
been
whispered
in
the
family
could
this
really
be
so
and
could
the
baronet
have
been
led
to
make
this
unexpected
visit
merely
for
the
purpose
of
personally
examining
into
the
condition
or
a
property
of
which
he
was
about
to
become
the
legal
invader
the
nature
of
this
suspicion
affords
at
all
events
a
fair
gauge
of
marston
estimate
of
his
cousin
character
and
as
he
revolved
these
doubts
from
time
to
time
and
as
he
thought
of
mademoiselle
de
barras
transient
but
unaccountable
embarrassment
at
the
mention
of
rouen
by
sir
wynston
an
embarrassment
which
the
baronet
himself
appeared
for
a
moment
to
reciprocate
undefined
glimmering
suspicions
of
another
kind
flickered
through
the
darkness
of
his
mind
he
was
effectually
puzzled
his
surmises
and
conjectures
baffled
and
he
more
than
half
repented
that
he
had
acceded
to
his
cousin
proposal
and
admitted
him
as
an
inmate
of
his
house
although
sir
wynston
comported
himself
as
if
he
were
conscious
of
being
the
very
most
welcome
visitor
who
could
possibly
have
established
himself
at
gray
forest
he
was
doubtless
fully
aware
of
the
real
feelings
with
which
he
was
regarded
by
his
host
if
he
had
in
reality
an
object
in
prolonging
his
stay
and
wished
to
make
the
postponement
of
his
departure
the
direct
interest
of
his
entertainer
he
unquestionably
took
effectual
measures
for
that
purpose
the
little
party
broke
up
every
evening
at
about
ten
and
sir
wynston
retired
to
his
chamber
at
the
same
hour
he
found
little
difficulty
in
inducing
marston
to
amuse
him
there
with
a
quiet
game
of
piquet
in
his
own
room
therefore
in
the
luxurious
ease
of
dressing
gown
and
slippers
he
sat
at
cards
with
his
host
often
until
an
hour
or
two
past
midnight
sir
wynston
was
exorbitantly
wealthy
and
very
reckless
in
expenditure
the
stakes
for
which
they
played
although
they
gradually
became
in
reality
pretty
heavy
were
in
his
eyes
a
very
unimportant
consideration
marston
on
the
other
hand
was
poor
and
played
with
the
eye
of
a
lynx
and
the
appetite
of
a
shark
the
ease
and
perfect
with
which
sir
wynston
lost
were
not
unimproved
by
his
entertainer
who
as
may
readily
be
supposed
was
not
sorry
to
reap
this
golden
harvest
provided
without
the
slightest
sacrifice
on
his
part
of
pride
or
independence
if
indeed
he
sometimes
suspected
that
his
guest
was
a
little
more
anxious
to
lose
than
to
win
he
was
also
quite
resolved
not
to
perceive
it
but
calmly
persisted
in
night
after
night
giving
sir
wynston
as
he
termed
it
his
revenge
or
in
other
words
treating
him
to
a
repetition
of
his
losses
all
this
was
very
agreeable
to
marston
who
began
to
treat
his
visitor
with
at
all
events
more
external
cordiality
and
distinction
than
at
first
an
incident
however
occurred
which
disturbed
these
amicable
relations
in
an
unexpected
way
it
becomes
necessary
here
to
mention
that
mademoiselle
de
barras
sleeping
apartment
opened
from
a
long
corridor
it
was
en
suite
with
two
dressing
rooms
each
opening
also
upon
the
corridor
but
wholly
unused
and
unfurnished
some
five
or
six
other
apartments
also
opened
at
either
side
upon
the
same
passage
these
little
local
details
being
premised
it
so
happened
that
one
day
marston
who
had
gone
out
with
the
intention
of
angling
in
the
which
flowed
through
his
park
though
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
house
having
unexpectedly
returned
to
procure
some
tackle
which
he
had
forgotten
was
walking
briskly
through
the
corridor
in
question
to
his
own
apartment
when
to
his
surprise
the
door
of
one
of
the
deserted
of
which
we
have
spoken
was
cautiously
pushed
open
and
sir
wynston
berkley
issued
from
it
marston
was
almost
beside
him
as
he
did
so
and
sir
wynston
made
a
motion
as
if
about
instinctively
to
draw
back
again
and
at
the
same
time
the
keen
ear
of
his
host
distinctly
caught
the
sound
of
rustling
silks
and
a
tiptoe
tread
hastily
withdrawing
from
the
deserted
chamber
sir
wynston
looked
nearly
as
much
confused
as
a
man
of
the
world
can
look
marston
stopped
short
and
scanned
his
visitor
for
a
moment
with
a
very
peculiar
expression
you
have
caught
me
peeping
dick
i
am
an
inveterate
explorer
said
the
baronet
with
an
effectual
effort
to
shake
off
his
embarrassment
an
open
door
in
a
fine
old
house
is
a
temptation
which
that
door
is
usually
closed
and
ought
to
be
kept
so
interrupted
marston
drily
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
be
seen
in
the
room
but
dust
and
cobwebs
pardon
me
said
sir
wynston
more
easily
you
forget
the
view
from
the
window
aye
the
view
to
be
sure
there
is
a
good
view
from
it
said
marston
with
as
much
of
his
usual
manner
as
he
could
resume
so
soon
and
at
the
same
time
carelessly
opening
the
door
again
he
walked
in
accompanied
by
sir
wynston
and
both
stood
at
the
window
together
looking
out
in
silence
upon
a
prospect
which
neither
of
them
saw
yes
i
do
think
it
is
a
good
view
said
marston
and
as
he
turned
carelessly
away
he
darted
a
swift
glance
round
the
chamber
the
door
opening
toward
the
french
lady
apartment
was
closed
but
not
actually
shut
this
was
enough
and
as
they
left
the
room
marston
repeated
his
invitation
to
his
guest
to
accompany
him
but
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
he
scarcely
followed
the
meaning
of
what
he
himself
was
saying
he
walked
undecidedly
toward
his
own
room
then
turned
and
went
down
stairs
in
the
hall
he
met
his
pretty
child
ha
rhoda
said
he
you
have
not
been
out
today
no
papa
but
it
is
so
very
fine
i
think
i
shall
go
now
yes
go
and
mademoiselle
can
accompany
you
do
you
hear
rhoda
mademoiselle
goes
with
you
and
you
had
better
go
at
once
a
few
minutes
more
and
marston
from
the
beheld
rhoda
and
the
elegant
french
girl
walking
together
towards
the
woodlands
he
watched
them
gloomily
himself
unseen
until
the
crowding
underwood
concealed
their
receding
figures
then
with
a
sigh
he
turned
and
reascended
the
great
staircase
i
shall
sift
this
mystery
to
the
bottom
thought
he
i
shall
foil
the
conspirators
if
so
they
be
with
their
own
weapons
art
with
art
chicane
with
chicane
duplicity
with
duplicity
he
was
now
in
the
long
passage
which
we
have
just
spoken
of
and
glancing
back
and
before
him
to
ascertain
that
no
chance
eye
discerned
him
he
boldly
entered
mademoiselle
chamber
her
writing
desk
lay
upon
the
table
it
was
locked
and
coolly
taking
it
in
his
hands
marston
carried
it
into
his
own
room
bolted
his
and
taking
two
or
three
bunches
of
keys
he
carefully
tried
nearly
a
dozen
in
succession
and
when
almost
despairing
of
success
at
last
found
one
which
fitted
the
lock
turned
and
opened
the
desk
sustained
throughout
his
dishonorable
task
by
some
strong
and
angry
passion
the
sight
of
the
open
escritoire
checked
and
startled
him
for
a
moment
violated
privilege
invaded
secrecy
base
perfidious
espionage
upbraided
and
stigmatized
him
as
the
intricacies
of
the
outraged
sanctuary
opened
upon
his
intrusive
gaze
he
felt
for
a
moment
shocked
and
humbled
he
was
impelled
to
lock
and
replace
the
desk
where
he
had
originally
found
it
without
having
effected
his
meditated
treason
but
this
hesitation
was
transient
the
fiery
and
reckless
impulse
which
had
urged
him
to
the
act
returned
to
enforce
its
consummation
with
a
guilty
eye
and
eager
hands
he
searched
the
contents
of
this
tiny
repository
of
the
fair
norman
written
secrets
ha
the
very
thing
he
muttered
as
he
detected
the
identical
letter
which
he
himself
had
handed
to
mademoiselle
de
barras
but
a
few
days
before
the
handwriting
struck
me
i
thought
i
knew
it
we
shall
see
he
had
opened
the
letter
it
contained
but
a
few
lines
he
held
his
breath
while
he
read
it
first
he
grew
pale
then
a
shadow
came
over
his
face
and
then
another
and
another
darker
and
darker
shade
upon
shade
as
if
an
exhalation
from
the
pit
was
momentarily
blackening
the
air
about
him
he
said
nothing
there
was
but
one
long
gentle
sigh
and
in
his
face
a
mortal
sternness
as
he
folded
the
letter
again
replaced
it
and
locked
the
desk
of
course
when
mademoiselle
de
barras
returned
from
her
accustomed
walk
she
found
everything
in
her
room
to
all
appearances
undisturbed
and
just
as
when
she
left
it
while
this
young
lady
was
making
her
toilet
for
the
evening
and
while
sir
wynston
berkley
was
worrying
himself
with
conjectures
as
to
whether
marston
evil
looks
when
he
encountered
him
that
morning
in
the
passage
existed
only
in
his
own
fancy
or
were
in
good
truth
very
grim
and
significant
realities
marston
himself
was
striding
alone
through
the
wildest
and
darkest
solitudes
of
his
park
haunted
by
his
own
unholy
thoughts
and
it
may
be
by
those
other
evil
and
unearthly
influences
which
wander
as
we
know
in
desert
places
darkness
overtook
him
and
the
chill
of
night
in
these
lonely
tracts
in
his
solitary
walk
what
fearful
company
had
he
been
keeping
as
the
shades
of
night
deepened
round
him
the
sense
of
the
neighborhood
of
ill
the
consciousness
of
the
foul
fancies
or
which
where
he
was
now
treading
he
had
been
for
hours
the
sport
oppressed
him
with
a
vague
and
unknown
terror
a
certain
horror
of
the
thoughts
which
had
been
his
comrades
through
the
day
which
he
could
not
now
shake
off
and
which
haunted
him
with
a
ghastly
and
defiant
pertinacity
scared
while
they
him
he
stalked
swiftly
homewards
like
a
guilty
man
pursued
marston
was
not
perfectly
satisfied
though
very
nearly
with
the
evidence
now
in
his
possession
the
letter
the
stolen
perusal
of
which
had
so
agitated
him
that
day
bore
no
signature
but
independently
of
the
handwriting
which
seemed
spite
of
the
constraint
of
an
attempted
disguise
to
be
familiar
to
his
eye
there
existed
in
the
matter
of
the
letter
short
as
it
was
certain
internal
evidences
which
although
not
actually
conclusive
raised
in
conjunction
with
all
the
other
circumstances
a
powerful
presumption
in
aid
of
his
suspicions
he
resolved
however
to
sift
the
matter
further
and
to
bide
his
time
meanwhile
his
manner
must
indicate
no
trace
of
his
dark
surmises
and
bitter
thoughts
deception
in
its
two
great
branches
simulation
and
dissimulation
was
easy
to
him
his
habitual
reserve
and
gloom
would
divest
any
accidental
and
momentary
disclosure
of
his
inward
trouble
of
everything
suspicious
or
unaccountable
which
would
have
characterized
such
displays
and
eccentricities
in
another
man
his
rapid
and
reckless
ramble
a
kind
of
physical
vent
for
the
paroxysm
which
had
so
agitated
him
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
day
had
soiled
and
disordered
his
dress
and
thus
had
helped
to
give
to
his
whole
appearance
a
certain
air
of
haggard
wildness
which
in
the
privacy
of
his
chamber
he
hastened
carefully
and
entirely
to
remove
at
supper
marston
was
apparently
in
unusually
good
spirits
sir
wynston
and
he
chatted
gaily
and
fluently
upon
many
subjects
grave
and
gay
among
them
the
inexhaustible
topic
of
popular
superstition
happened
to
turn
up
and
especially
the
subject
of
strange
prophecies
of
the
fates
and
fortunes
of
individuals
singularly
fulfilled
in
the
events
of
their
afterlife
dick
this
is
rather
a
nervous
topic
for
me
to
discuss
said
sir
wynston
how
so
asked
his
host
why
do
you
remember
urged
the
baronet
no
i
do
recollect
what
you
allude
to
replied
marston
in
all
sincerity
why
do
you
remember
eton
pursued
sir
wynston
yes
to
be
sure
said
marston
well
continued
his
visitor
well
i
really
do
recollect
the
prophecy
replied
marston
what
do
you
forget
the
gypsy
who
predicted
that
you
were
to
murder
me
dick
eh
ha
laughed
marston
with
a
start
do
you
remember
it
now
urged
his
companion
ah
why
yes
i
believe
i
do
said
marston
but
another
prophecy
was
running
in
my
mind
a
gypsy
prediction
too
at
ascot
do
you
recollect
the
girl
told
me
i
was
to
be
lord
chancellor
of
england
and
a
duke
besides
well
dick
rejoined
sir
wynston
merrily
if
both
are
to
be
fulfilled
or
neither
i
trust
you
may
never
sit
upon
the
woolsack
of
england
the
party
soon
after
broke
up
sir
wynston
and
his
host
as
usual
to
pass
some
hours
at
piquet
and
marston
as
was
her
wont
to
spend
some
time
in
her
own
boudoir
over
notes
and
accounts
and
the
worrying
details
of
housekeeping
while
thus
engaged
she
was
disturbed
by
a
respectful
tap
at
her
door
and
an
elderly
servant
who
had
been
for
many
years
in
the
employment
of
marston
presented
himself
well
merton
do
you
want
anything
asked
the
lady
yes
please
i
want
to
give
warning
i
wish
to
leave
the
service
replied
he
respectfully
but
doggedly
to
leave
us
merton
echoed
his
mistress
both
surprised
and
sorry
for
the
man
had
been
long
her
servant
and
had
been
much
liked
and
trusted
yes
he
repeated
and
why
do
you
wish
to
do
so
merton
has
anything
occurred
to
make
the
place
unpleasant
to
you
urged
the
lady
no
no
indeed
said
he
earnestly
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
nothing
indeed
perhaps
you
think
you
can
do
better
if
you
leave
us
suggested
his
mistress
no
indeed
i
have
no
such
thought
he
said
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
but
but
somehow
there
is
something
come
over
me
lately
and
i
ca
help
but
think
if
i
stay
here
some
some
misfortune
will
happen
to
us
all
and
that
is
the
truth
this
is
very
foolish
merton
a
mere
childish
fancy
replied
marston
you
like
your
place
and
have
no
better
prospect
before
you
and
now
for
a
mere
superstitious
fancy
you
propose
giving
it
up
and
leaving
us
no
no
merton
you
had
better
think
the
matter
over
and
if
you
still
upon
reflection
prefer
going
away
you
can
then
speak
to
your
master
thank
you
god
bless
you
said
the
man
withdrawing
marston
rang
the
bell
for
her
maid
and
retired
to
her
room
has
anything
occurred
lately
she
asked
to
annoy
merton
no
i
do
know
of
anything
but
he
is
very
changed
indeed
of
late
replied
the
maid
he
has
not
been
quarreling
inquired
she
oh
no
he
never
quarrels
he
is
very
quiet
and
keeps
to
himself
always
he
thinks
a
wonderful
deal
of
himself
replied
the
servant
but
you
said
that
he
is
much
changed
did
you
not
continued
the
lady
for
there
was
something
strangely
excited
and
unpleasant
in
the
manner
in
this
little
interview
which
struck
marston
and
alarmed
her
curiosity
he
had
seemed
like
one
charged
with
some
horrible
secret
intolerable
and
which
he
yet
dared
not
reveal
what
proceeded
marston
is
the
nature
of
the
change
of
which
you
speak
why
he
is
like
one
frightened
and
in
sorrow
she
replied
he
will
sit
silent
and
now
and
then
shaking
his
head
as
if
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
something
that
is
teasing
him
for
an
hour
together
poor
man
said
she
and
then
when
we
are
at
meals
he
will
all
on
a
sudden
get
up
and
leave
the
table
and
jem
boulter
that
sleeps
in
the
next
room
to
him
says
that
almost
as
often
as
he
looks
through
the
little
window
between
the
two
rooms
no
matter
what
hour
in
the
night
he
sees
merton
on
his
knees
by
the
bedside
praying
or
crying
he
do
know
which
but
any
way
he
is
not
happy
poor
man
and
that
is
plain
enough
it
is
very
strange
said
the
lady
after
a
pause
but
i
think
and
hope
after
all
it
will
prove
to
have
been
no
more
than
a
little
nervousness
well
i
do
hope
it
is
not
his
conscience
that
is
coming
against
him
now
said
the
maid
we
have
no
reason
to
suspect
anything
of
the
kind
said
marston
gravely
quite
the
reverse
he
has
been
always
a
particularly
proper
man
oh
indeed
responded
the
attendant
goodness
forbid
i
should
say
or
think
anything
against
him
but
i
could
not
help
telling
you
my
mind
meaning
no
harm
and
how
long
is
it
since
you
observed
this
sad
change
in
poor
merton
persisted
the
lady
not
indeed
to
say
very
long
replied
the
girl
somewhere
about
a
week
or
very
little
more
at
least
as
we
remarked
marston
pursued
her
inquiries
no
further
that
night
but
although
she
affected
to
treat
the
matter
thus
lightly
it
had
somehow
taken
a
painful
hold
upon
her
imagination
and
left
in
her
mind
those
undefinable
and
ominous
sensations
which
in
certain
mental
temperaments
seem
to
foreshadow
the
approach
of
unknown
misfortune
for
two
or
three
days
everything
went
on
smoothly
and
pretty
much
as
usual
at
the
end
of
this
brief
interval
however
the
attention
of
marston
was
recalled
to
the
subject
of
her
servant
mysterious
anxiety
to
leave
and
give
up
his
situation
merton
again
stood
before
her
and
repeated
the
intimation
he
had
already
given
really
merton
this
is
very
odd
said
the
lady
you
like
your
situation
and
yet
you
persist
in
desiring
to
leave
it
what
am
i
to
think
oh
said
he
i
am
unhappy
i
am
tormented
i
ca
tell
you
i
ca
indeed
if
anything
weighs
upon
your
mind
merton
i
would
advise
you
to
consult
our
good
clergyman
danvers
urged
the
lady
the
servant
hung
his
head
and
mused
for
a
time
gloomily
and
then
said
decisively
no
no
use
and
pray
merton
how
long
is
it
since
you
first
entertained
this
desire
asked
marston
since
sir
wynston
berkley
came
answered
he
has
sir
wynston
annoyed
you
in
any
way
continued
she
far
from
it
he
replied
he
is
a
very
kind
gentleman
well
his
man
then
is
he
a
respectable
inoffensive
person
she
inquired
i
never
met
one
more
so
said
the
man
promptly
and
raising
his
head
what
i
wish
to
know
is
whether
your
desire
to
go
is
connected
with
sir
wynston
and
his
servant
said
marston
the
man
hesitated
and
shifted
his
position
uneasily
you
need
not
answer
merton
if
you
do
wish
it
she
said
kindly
why
yes
it
has
something
to
say
to
them
both
he
replied
with
some
agitation
i
really
can
not
understand
this
said
she
merton
hesitated
for
some
time
and
appeared
much
troubled
it
was
something
something
that
sir
wynston
man
said
to
me
and
there
it
is
out
he
said
at
last
with
an
effort
well
merton
said
she
i
wo
press
you
further
but
i
must
say
that
as
this
communication
whatever
it
may
be
has
caused
you
unquestionably
very
great
uneasiness
it
seems
to
me
but
probable
that
it
affects
the
safety
or
the
interests
of
some
person
i
can
not
say
of
whom
and
if
so
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
your
duty
to
acquaint
those
who
are
so
involved
in
the
disclosure
with
its
purport
no
there
is
nothing
in
what
i
heard
that
could
touch
anybody
but
myself
it
was
nothing
but
what
others
heard
without
remarking
it
or
thinking
about
it
i
ca
tell
you
anymore
but
i
am
very
unhappy
and
uneasy
in
my
mind
as
the
man
said
this
he
began
to
weep
bitterly
the
idea
that
his
mind
was
affected
now
seriously
occurred
to
marston
and
she
resolved
to
convey
her
suspicions
to
her
husband
and
to
leave
him
to
deal
with
the
case
as
to
him
should
seem
good
do
agitate
yourself
so
merton
i
shall
speak
to
your
master
upon
what
you
have
said
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
no
surmise
to
the
prejudice
of
your
character
has
entered
my
mind
said
marston
very
kindly
oh
you
are
too
good
sobbed
the
poor
man
vehemently
you
do
know
me
i
never
knew
myself
till
lately
i
am
a
miserable
man
i
am
frightened
at
myself
frightened
terribly
christ
knows
it
would
be
well
for
me
i
was
dead
this
minute
i
am
very
sorry
for
your
unhappiness
merton
said
marston
and
especially
that
i
can
do
nothing
to
alleviate
it
i
can
but
speak
as
i
have
said
to
your
master
and
he
will
give
you
your
discharge
and
arrange
whatever
else
remains
to
be
done
god
bless
you
said
the
servant
still
much
agitated
and
left
her
marston
usually
passed
the
early
part
of
the
day
in
active
exercise
and
she
supposing
that
he
was
in
all
probability
at
that
moment
far
from
home
went
to
mademoiselle
chamber
which
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
spacious
house
to
confer
with
her
in
the
interval
upon
the
strange
application
thus
urged
by
poor
merton
just
as
she
reached
the
door
of
mademoiselle
de
barras
chamber
she
heard
voices
within
exerted
in
evident
excitement
she
stopped
in
amazement
they
were
those
of
her
husband
and
mademoiselle
startled
confounded
and
amazed
she
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
her
husband
was
sitting
one
hand
clutched
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
he
occupied
and
the
other
extended
and
clenched
as
it
seemed
with
the
emphasis
of
rage
upon
the
desk
that
stood
upon
the
table
his
face
was
darkened
with
the
stormiest
passions
and
his
gaze
was
fixed
upon
the
frenchwoman
who
was
standing
with
a
look
at
a
little
distance
there
was
something
to
marston
so
utterly
unexpected
and
even
so
shocking
in
this
tableau
that
she
stood
for
some
seconds
pale
and
breathless
and
gazing
with
a
vacant
stare
of
fear
and
horror
from
her
husband
to
the
french
girl
and
from
her
to
her
husband
again
the
three
figures
in
this
strange
group
remained
fixed
silent
and
aghast
for
several
seconds
marston
endeavored
to
speak
but
though
her
lips
moved
no
sound
escaped
her
and
from
very
weakness
she
sank
into
a
chair
marston
rose
throwing
as
he
did
so
a
guilty
and
furious
glance
at
the
young
frenchwoman
and
walked
a
step
or
two
toward
the
door
he
hesitated
however
and
turned
just
as
mademoiselle
bursting
into
tears
threw
her
arms
round
marston
neck
and
passionately
exclaimed
protect
me
madame
i
implore
from
the
insults
and
suspicions
of
your
husband
marston
stood
a
little
behind
his
wife
and
he
and
the
governess
exchanged
a
glance
of
keen
significance
as
the
latter
sank
sobbing
like
an
injured
child
into
its
mother
embrace
upon
the
poor
tortured
bosom
madame
madame
he
says
marston
says
i
have
presumed
to
give
you
advice
and
to
meddle
and
to
interfere
that
i
am
endeavoring
to
make
you
despise
his
authority
madame
speak
for
me
say
madame
have
i
ever
done
so
say
madame
am
i
the
cause
of
bitterness
and
contumacy
ah
mon
dieu
trop
it
is
too
much
madame
i
shall
go
i
must
go
madame
why
ah
why
did
i
stay
for
this
as
she
thus
spoke
mademoiselle
again
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
weeping
and
again
the
same
significant
glance
was
interchanged
go
yes
you
shall
go
said
marston
striding
toward
the
window
i
will
have
no
whispering
or
conspiring
in
my
house
i
have
heard
of
your
confidences
and
consultations
marston
i
meant
to
have
done
this
quietly
he
continued
addressing
his
wife
i
meant
to
have
given
mademoiselle
de
barras
my
opinion
and
her
dismissal
without
your
assistance
but
it
seems
you
wish
to
interpose
you
are
sworn
friends
and
never
fail
one
another
of
course
at
a
pinch
i
take
it
for
granted
that
i
owe
your
presence
at
our
interview
which
i
am
resolved
shall
be
as
respects
mademoiselle
a
final
one
to
a
message
from
that
intriguing
young
lady
eh
i
have
had
no
message
richard
said
marston
i
know
do
tell
me
for
god
sake
what
is
all
this
about
and
as
the
poor
lady
thus
spoke
her
overwrought
feelings
found
vent
in
a
violent
flood
of
tears
yes
madame
that
is
the
question
i
have
asked
him
frequently
what
is
all
this
anger
all
these
reproaches
about
what
have
i
done
interposed
mademoiselle
with
indignant
vehemence
standing
erect
and
viewing
marston
with
a
flashing
eye
and
a
flushed
cheek
yes
i
am
called
conspirator
meddler
intrigant
ah
madame
it
is
intolerable
but
what
have
i
done
richard
urged
the
poor
lady
stunned
and
bewildered
how
have
i
offended
you
yes
yes
continued
the
frenchwoman
with
angry
volubility
what
has
she
done
that
you
call
contumacy
and
disrespect
yes
dear
madame
there
is
the
question
and
if
he
can
not
answer
is
it
not
most
cruel
to
call
me
conspirator
and
spy
and
intrigant
because
i
talk
to
my
dear
madame
who
is
my
only
friend
in
this
place
mademoiselle
de
barras
i
need
no
declamation
from
you
and
pardon
me
marston
nor
from
you
either
retorted
he
i
have
my
information
from
one
on
whom
i
can
rely
let
that
suffice
of
course
you
are
both
agreed
in
a
story
i
dare
say
you
are
ready
to
swear
you
never
so
much
as
canvassed
my
conduct
and
my
coldness
and
estrangement
eh
these
are
the
words
are
not
they
i
have
done
you
no
wrong
sir
madame
can
tell
you
i
am
no
no
i
never
was
such
a
thing
was
i
madame
persisted
the
governess
bear
witness
for
me
i
have
told
you
my
mind
mademoiselle
de
barras
interrupted
marston
i
will
have
no
altercation
if
you
please
i
think
marston
we
have
had
enough
of
this
may
i
accompany
you
hence
so
saying
he
took
the
poor
lady
passive
hand
and
led
her
from
the
room
mademoiselle
stood
in
the
center
of
the
apartment
alone
erect
with
heaving
breast
and
burning
cheek
beautiful
thoughtful
guilty
the
very
type
of
the
fallen
angelic
there
for
a
time
her
heart
all
confusion
her
mind
darkened
we
must
leave
her
various
courses
before
her
and
as
yet
without
resolution
to
choose
among
them
a
lost
spirit
borne
on
the
eddies
of
the
storm
fearless
and
but
with
no
star
to
guide
her
on
her
dark
malign
and
forlorn
way
marston
in
her
own
room
reviewed
the
agitating
scene
through
which
she
had
just
been
so
unexpectedly
carried
the
tremendous
suspicion
which
at
the
first
disclosure
of
the
tableau
we
have
described
smote
the
heart
and
brain
of
the
poor
lady
with
the
stun
of
a
thunderbolt
had
been
indeed
subsequently
disturbed
and
afterwards
contradicted
but
the
shock
of
her
first
impression
remained
still
upon
her
mind
and
heart
she
felt
still
through
every
nerve
the
vibrations
of
that
maddening
terror
and
despair
which
had
overcome
her
senses
for
a
moment
the
surprise
the
shock
the
horror
outlived
the
obliterating
influence
of
what
followed
she
was
in
this
agitation
when
mademoiselle
de
barras
entered
her
chamber
resolved
with
all
her
art
to
second
and
support
the
success
of
her
prompt
measures
in
the
recent
critical
emergency
she
had
come
she
said
to
bid
her
dear
madame
farewell
for
she
was
resolved
to
go
her
own
room
had
been
invaded
that
insult
and
reproach
might
be
heaped
upon
her
how
utterly
unmerited
marston
knew
she
had
been
called
by
every
foul
name
which
applied
to
the
spy
and
the
maligner
she
could
not
bear
it
some
one
had
evidently
been
endeavoring
to
procure
her
removal
and
had
but
too
effectually
succeeded
mademoiselle
was
determined
to
go
early
the
next
morning
nothing
should
prevent
or
retard
her
departure
her
resolution
was
taken
in
this
strain
did
mademoiselle
run
on
but
in
a
subdued
and
melancholy
tone
and
weeping
profusely
the
wild
and
ghastly
suspicions
which
had
for
a
moment
flashed
terribly
upon
the
mind
of
marston
had
faded
away
under
the
influences
of
reason
and
reflection
although
indeed
much
painful
excitement
still
remained
before
mademoiselle
de
barras
had
visited
her
room
temper
she
knew
but
too
well
it
was
violent
bitter
and
impetuous
and
though
he
cared
little
if
at
all
for
her
she
had
ever
perceived
that
he
was
angrily
jealous
of
the
slightest
intimacy
or
confidence
by
which
any
other
than
himself
might
establish
an
influence
over
her
mind
that
he
had
learned
the
subject
of
some
of
her
most
interesting
conversations
with
mademoiselle
she
could
not
doubt
for
he
had
violently
upbraided
that
young
lady
in
her
presence
with
having
discussed
it
and
here
now
was
mademoiselle
herself
taking
refuge
with
her
from
galling
affront
and
unjust
reproach
incensed
wounded
and
weeping
the
whole
thing
was
consistent
all
the
circumstances
bore
plainly
in
the
same
direction
the
evidence
was
conclusive
and
marston
thoughts
and
feelings
respecting
her
fair
young
confidante
quickly
found
their
old
level
and
flowed
on
tranquilly
and
sadly
in
their
accustomed
channel
while
mademoiselle
de
barras
was
thus
with
the
persevering
industry
of
the
spider
repairing
the
meshes
which
a
chance
breath
had
shattered
she
would
perhaps
have
been
in
her
turn
shocked
and
startled
could
she
have
glanced
into
marston
mind
and
seen
in
what
was
passing
there
the
real
extent
of
her
danger
marston
was
walking
as
usual
alone
and
in
the
most
solitary
region
of
his
lonely
park
one
hand
grasped
his
walking
stick
not
to
lean
upon
it
but
as
if
it
were
the
handle
of
a
the
other
was
buried
in
his
bosom
his
dark
face
looked
upon
the
ground
and
he
strode
onward
with
a
slow
but
energetic
step
which
had
the
air
of
deep
resolution
he
found
himself
at
last
in
a
little
churchyard
lying
far
among
the
wild
forest
of
his
demesne
and
in
the
midst
of
which
covered
with
ivy
and
tufted
plants
now
ruddy
with
autumnal
tints
stood
the
ruined
walls
of
a
little
chapel
in
the
dilapidated
vault
close
by
lay
buried
many
of
his
ancestors
and
under
the
little
wavy
hillocks
of
fern
and
nettles
slept
many
an
humble
villager
he
sat
down
upon
a
worn
tombstone
in
this
lowly
ruin
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
he
surrendered
his
spirit
to
the
stormy
and
evil
thoughts
which
he
had
invited
long
and
motionless
he
sat
there
while
his
foul
fancies
and
schemes
began
to
assume
shape
and
order
the
wind
rushing
through
the
ivy
roused
him
for
a
moment
and
as
he
raised
his
gloomy
eye
it
alighted
accidentally
upon
a
skull
which
some
wanton
hand
had
fixed
in
a
crevice
of
the
wall
he
averted
his
glance
quickly
but
almost
as
quickly
refixed
his
gaze
upon
the
impassive
symbol
of
death
with
an
expression
glowering
and
contemptuous
and
with
an
angry
gesture
struck
it
down
among
the
weeds
with
his
stick
he
left
the
place
and
wandered
on
through
the
woods
men
ca
control
the
thoughts
that
flit
across
their
minds
he
muttered
as
he
went
along
anymore
than
they
can
direct
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
that
sail
above
them
they
come
and
pass
and
leave
no
stain
behind
what
then
of
omens
and
that
wretched
effigy
of
death
stuff
pshaw
murder
indeed
i
incapable
of
murder
i
have
drawn
my
sword
upon
a
man
in
fair
duel
but
murder
out
upon
the
thought
out
upon
it
he
stamped
upon
the
ground
with
a
pang
at
once
of
fury
and
horror
he
walked
on
a
little
stopped
again
and
folding
his
arms
leaned
against
an
ancient
tree
mademoiselle
de
barras
êtes
une
and
you
shall
go
yes
go
you
shall
you
have
deceived
me
and
we
must
part
he
said
this
with
melancholy
bitterness
and
after
a
pause
continued
i
will
have
no
other
revenge
no
though
i
dare
say
she
will
care
but
little
for
this
very
little
if
at
all
and
then
as
to
the
other
person
he
resumed
after
a
pause
it
is
not
the
first
time
he
has
acted
like
a
trickster
he
has
crossed
me
before
and
i
will
choose
an
opportunity
to
tell
him
my
mind
i
wo
mince
matters
with
him
either
and
will
not
spare
him
one
insulting
syllable
that
he
deserves
he
wears
a
sword
and
so
do
i
if
he
pleases
he
may
draw
it
he
shall
have
the
opportunity
but
at
all
events
i
will
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
prolong
his
disgraceful
visit
at
my
house
on
reaching
home
and
his
own
study
the
servant
merton
presented
himself
and
his
master
too
deeply
excited
to
hear
him
then
appointed
the
next
day
for
the
purpose
there
was
no
contending
against
peremptory
will
and
the
man
reluctantly
withdrew
here
was
apparently
a
matter
of
no
imaginable
moment
whether
this
menial
should
be
discharged
on
that
day
or
on
the
morrow
and
yet
mighty
things
were
involved
in
the
alternative
there
was
a
deeper
gloom
than
usual
over
the
house
the
servants
seemed
to
know
that
something
had
gone
wrong
and
looked
grave
and
mysterious
marston
was
more
than
ever
dark
and
moody
marston
dimmed
and
swollen
eyes
showed
that
she
had
been
weeping
mademoiselle
absented
herself
from
supper
on
the
plea
of
a
bad
headache
rhoda
saw
that
something
she
knew
not
what
had
occurred
to
agitate
her
elders
and
was
depressed
and
anxious
the
old
clergyman
whom
we
have
already
mentioned
had
called
and
stayed
to
supper
danvers
was
a
man
of
considerable
learning
strong
sense
and
remarkable
simplicity
of
character
his
thoughtful
blue
eye
and
countenance
were
full
of
gentleness
and
benevolence
and
elevated
by
a
certain
natural
dignity
of
which
purity
and
goodness
without
one
debasing
shade
of
and
arrogance
were
the
animating
spirit
marston
loved
and
respected
this
good
minister
of
god
and
many
a
time
had
sought
and
found
in
his
gentle
and
earnest
counsels
and
in
the
overflowing
tenderness
of
his
sympathy
much
comfort
and
support
in
the
progress
of
her
sore
and
protracted
earthly
trial
most
especially
at
one
critical
period
in
her
history
had
he
endeared
himself
to
her
by
interposing
and
successfully
to
prevent
a
formal
separation
which
as
ending
forever
the
one
hope
that
cheered
her
on
even
in
the
front
of
despair
she
would
probably
not
long
have
survived
with
marston
however
he
was
far
from
being
a
favorite
there
was
that
in
his
lofty
and
simple
purity
which
abashed
and
silently
reproached
the
sensual
bitter
disappointed
man
of
the
world
the
angry
pride
of
the
scornful
man
felt
its
own
meanness
in
the
grand
presence
of
a
simple
and
humble
christian
minister
and
the
very
fact
that
all
his
habits
had
led
him
to
hold
such
a
character
in
contempt
made
him
but
the
more
unreasonably
resent
the
involuntary
homage
which
its
exhibition
in
danvers
person
invariably
extorted
from
him
he
felt
in
this
good
presence
under
a
kind
of
irritating
restraint
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
one
with
whom
he
had
and
could
have
no
sympathy
whatever
and
yet
one
whom
he
could
not
help
both
admiring
and
respecting
and
in
these
conflicting
feelings
were
involved
certain
gloomy
and
humbling
inferences
about
himself
which
he
hated
and
almost
feared
to
contemplate
it
was
well
however
for
the
indulgence
of
sir
wynston
conversational
propensities
that
danvers
had
happened
to
drop
in
for
marston
was
doggedly
silent
and
sullen
and
marston
was
herself
scarcely
more
disposed
than
he
to
maintain
her
part
in
a
conversation
so
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
opportune
arrival
of
the
good
clergyman
the
supper
must
have
been
dispatched
with
a
very
awkward
and
unsocial
taciturnity
marston
thought
and
perhaps
not
erroneously
that
sir
wynston
suspected
something
of
the
real
state
of
affairs
and
he
was
therefore
incensed
to
perceive
as
he
thought
in
his
manner
very
evident
indications
of
his
being
in
unusually
good
spirits
thus
disposed
the
party
sat
down
to
supper
one
of
our
number
is
missing
said
sir
wynston
affecting
a
slight
surprise
which
perhaps
he
did
not
feel
mademoiselle
de
barras
i
trust
she
is
well
said
doctor
danvers
looking
towards
marston
i
suppose
she
is
i
do
know
said
marston
drily
why
how
should
he
know
said
the
baronet
gaily
but
with
something
almost
imperceptibly
sarcastic
in
his
tone
our
friend
marston
is
privileged
to
be
as
ungallant
as
he
pleases
except
where
he
has
the
happy
privilege
to
owe
allegiance
but
i
a
gay
young
bachelor
of
fifty
am
naturally
curious
i
really
do
trust
that
our
charming
french
friend
is
not
unwell
he
addressed
his
inquiry
to
marston
who
with
some
slight
confusion
replied
no
nothing
at
least
serious
merely
a
slight
headache
i
am
sure
she
will
be
quite
well
enough
to
come
down
to
breakfast
she
is
indeed
a
very
charming
and
interesting
young
person
said
doctor
danvers
there
is
a
certain
simplicity
about
her
which
argues
a
good
and
kind
heart
and
an
open
nature
very
true
indeed
doctor
observed
berkley
with
the
same
faint
but
to
marston
exquisitely
provoking
approximation
to
sarcasm
there
is
as
you
say
a
very
charming
simplicity
do
you
think
so
marston
marston
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
but
continued
silent
poor
mademoiselle
she
is
indeed
a
most
affectionate
creature
said
marston
who
felt
called
upon
to
say
something
come
marston
will
you
contribute
nothing
to
the
general
fund
of
approbation
said
sir
wynston
who
was
gifted
by
nature
with
an
amiable
talent
for
teasing
which
he
was
fond
of
exercising
in
a
quiet
way
we
have
all
but
you
said
something
handsome
of
our
absent
young
friend
i
never
praise
anybody
wynston
not
even
you
said
marston
with
an
obvious
sneer
well
well
i
must
comfort
myself
with
the
belief
that
your
silence
covers
a
great
deal
of
and
perhaps
a
little
admiration
too
answered
his
cousin
significantly
comfort
yourself
in
any
honest
way
you
will
my
dear
wynston
retorted
marston
with
a
degree
of
asperity
which
to
all
but
the
baronet
himself
was
unaccountable
you
may
be
right
you
may
be
wrong
on
a
subject
so
unimportant
it
matters
very
little
which
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
practice
delusions
if
you
will
upon
yourself
marston
is
not
your
son
about
to
come
down
here
asked
doctor
danvers
who
perceived
that
the
altercation
was
becoming
on
marston
part
somewhat
testy
if
not
positively
rude
yes
i
expect
him
in
a
few
days
replied
he
with
a
sudden
gloom
you
have
not
seen
him
sir
wynston
asked
the
clergyman
i
have
that
pleasure
yet
to
come
said
the
baronet
a
pleasure
it
is
i
do
assure
you
said
doctor
danvers
heartily
he
is
a
handsome
lad
with
the
heart
of
a
hero
a
fine
frank
generous
lad
and
as
merry
as
a
lark
yes
yes
interrupted
marston
he
is
well
enough
and
has
done
pretty
well
at
cambridge
doctor
danvers
take
some
wine
it
was
strange
but
yet
mournfully
true
that
the
praises
which
the
good
doctor
danvers
thus
bestowed
upon
his
son
were
bitter
to
the
soul
of
the
unhappy
marston
they
jarred
upon
his
ear
and
stung
his
heart
for
his
conscience
converted
them
into
so
many
latent
insults
and
humiliations
to
himself
your
wine
is
very
good
marston
i
think
your
clarets
are
many
degrees
better
than
any
i
can
get
said
sir
wynston
sipping
a
glass
of
his
favorite
wine
you
country
gentlemen
are
sad
selfish
dogs
and
with
all
your
grumbling
manage
to
collect
the
best
of
whatever
is
worth
having
about
you
we
sometimes
succeed
in
collecting
a
pleasant
party
retorted
marston
with
ironical
courtesy
though
we
do
not
always
command
the
means
of
entertaining
them
quite
as
we
would
wish
it
was
the
habit
of
doctor
danvers
without
respect
of
persons
or
places
to
propose
before
taking
his
departure
from
whatever
domestic
party
he
chanced
to
be
thrown
among
for
the
evening
to
read
some
verses
from
that
holy
book
on
which
his
own
hopes
and
peace
were
founded
and
to
offer
up
a
prayer
for
all
to
the
throne
of
grace
marston
although
he
usually
absented
himself
from
such
exercises
did
not
otherwise
discourage
them
but
upon
the
present
occasion
starting
from
his
gloomy
reverie
he
himself
was
the
first
to
remind
the
clergyman
of
his
customary
observance
evil
thoughts
loomed
upon
the
mind
of
marston
like
measureless
black
mists
upon
a
cold
smooth
sea
they
rested
grew
and
darkened
there
and
no
breath
came
silently
to
steal
them
away
under
this
dread
shadow
his
mind
lay
waiting
like
the
deep
before
the
spirit
of
god
moved
upon
its
waters
passive
and
awful
why
for
the
first
time
now
did
religion
interest
him
the
unseen
intangible
was
even
now
at
work
within
him
a
dreadful
power
shook
his
very
heart
and
soul
there
was
some
strange
ghastly
wrestling
going
on
in
his
own
immortal
spirit
a
struggle
that
made
him
faint
which
he
had
no
power
to
determine
he
looked
upon
the
holy
influence
of
the
good
man
prayer
a
prayer
in
which
he
could
not
join
with
a
dull
superstitious
hope
that
the
words
inviting
better
influence
though
uttered
by
another
and
with
other
objects
would
like
a
spell
chase
away
the
foul
fiend
that
was
busy
with
his
soul
marston
sate
looking
into
the
fire
with
a
countenance
of
stern
gloom
upon
which
the
wayward
lights
of
the
flickering
hearth
sported
fitfully
while
at
a
distant
table
doctor
danvers
sate
down
and
taking
his
bible
from
his
pocket
turned
over
its
leaves
and
began
in
gentle
but
impressive
tones
to
read
sir
wynston
was
much
too
well
bred
to
evince
the
slightest
disposition
to
aught
but
the
most
proper
and
profound
attention
the
faintest
imaginable
gleam
of
ridicule
might
perhaps
have
been
discerned
in
his
features
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
closing
his
eyes
composed
himself
to
at
least
an
attitude
of
attention
no
man
could
submit
with
more
cheerfulness
to
an
inevitable
bore
in
these
things
then
thou
hast
no
concern
the
judgment
troubles
thee
not
thou
hast
no
fear
of
death
sir
wynston
berkley
yet
there
is
a
heart
beating
near
thee
the
mysteries
of
which
could
they
glide
out
and
stand
before
thy
face
would
perchance
appal
thee
cold
easy
man
of
the
world
aye
couldst
thou
but
see
with
those
cunning
eyes
of
thine
but
twelve
brief
hours
into
futurity
each
syllable
that
falls
from
that
good
man
lips
unheeded
would
peal
through
thy
heart
and
brain
like
maddening
thunder
hearken
hearken
sir
wynston
berkley
perchance
these
are
the
farewell
words
of
thy
better
angel
the
last
pleadings
of
despised
mercy
the
party
broke
up
doctor
danvers
took
his
leave
and
rode
homeward
down
the
broad
avenue
between
the
gigantic
ranks
of
elm
that
closed
it
in
the
full
moon
was
rising
above
the
distant
hills
the
mists
lay
like
sleeping
lakes
in
the
laps
of
the
hollows
and
the
broad
demesne
looked
tranquil
and
sad
under
this
chastened
and
silvery
glory
the
good
old
clergyman
thought
as
he
pursued
his
way
that
here
at
least
in
a
spot
so
beautiful
and
sequestered
the
stormy
passions
and
fell
contentions
of
the
outer
world
could
scarcely
penetrate
yet
in
that
calm
secluded
spot
and
under
the
cold
pure
light
which
fell
so
holily
what
a
hell
was
weltering
and
glaring
what
a
spectacle
was
that
moon
to
go
down
upon
as
sir
wynston
was
leaving
the
parlor
for
his
own
room
marston
accompanied
him
to
the
hall
and
said
i
play
tonight
sir
wynston
ah
ha
very
particularly
engaged
suggested
the
baronet
with
a
faint
mocking
smile
well
my
dear
fellow
we
must
endeavor
to
make
up
for
it
tomorrow
eh
i
do
know
that
said
marston
and
in
a
word
there
is
no
use
sir
in
our
masquerading
with
one
another
each
knows
the
other
each
understands
the
other
i
wish
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
in
your
room
tonight
when
we
sha
be
interrupted
marston
spoke
in
a
fierce
and
grating
whisper
and
his
countenance
more
even
than
his
accents
betrayed
the
intensity
of
his
bridled
fury
sir
wynston
however
smiled
upon
his
cousin
as
if
his
voice
had
been
melody
and
his
looks
all
sunshine
very
good
marston
just
as
you
please
he
said
only
do
be
later
than
one
as
i
shall
be
getting
into
bed
about
that
hour
perhaps
upon
second
thoughts
it
is
as
well
to
defer
what
i
have
to
say
said
marston
musingly
tomorrow
will
do
as
well
so
perhaps
sir
wynston
i
may
not
trouble
you
tonight
just
as
suits
you
best
my
dear
marston
replied
the
baronet
with
a
tranquil
smile
only
do
come
after
the
hour
i
have
stipulated
so
saying
the
baronet
mounted
the
stairs
and
made
his
way
to
his
chamber
he
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
in
high
with
himself
the
object
of
his
visit
to
gray
forest
had
been
as
he
now
flattered
himself
attained
he
had
conducted
an
affair
requiring
the
profoundest
mystery
in
its
prosecution
and
the
nicest
tactic
in
its
management
almost
to
a
triumphant
issue
he
had
perfectly
masked
his
design
and
completely
outwitted
marston
and
to
a
person
who
piqued
himself
upon
his
clever
diplomacy
and
vaunted
that
he
had
never
yet
sustained
a
defeat
in
any
object
which
he
had
seriously
proposed
to
himself
such
a
combination
of
successes
was
for
the
moment
quite
intoxicating
sir
wynston
not
only
enjoyed
his
own
superiority
with
all
the
vanity
of
a
selfish
nature
but
he
no
less
enjoyed
with
a
keen
and
malicious
relish
the
intense
mortification
which
he
was
well
assured
marston
must
experience
and
all
the
more
acutely
because
of
the
utter
impossibility
circumstanced
as
he
was
of
his
taking
any
steps
to
manifest
his
vexation
without
compromising
himself
in
a
most
unpleasant
way
animated
by
these
amiable
feelings
sir
wynston
berkley
sate
down
and
wrote
the
following
short
letter
addressed
to
gray
wynston
hall
gray
on
receipt
of
this
have
the
sitting
rooms
and
several
bedrooms
put
in
order
and
thoroughly
aired
prepare
for
my
use
the
suite
of
three
rooms
over
the
library
and
drawing
room
and
have
the
two
great
wardrobes
and
the
cabinet
in
the
state
bedroom
removed
into
the
large
dressing
room
which
opens
upon
the
bedroom
i
have
named
make
everything
as
comfortable
as
possible
if
anything
is
wanted
in
the
way
of
furniture
drapery
ornament
you
need
only
write
to
john
skelton
london
stating
what
is
required
and
he
will
order
and
send
them
down
you
must
be
expeditious
as
i
shall
probably
go
down
to
wynston
with
two
or
three
friends
at
the
beginning
of
next
month
wynston
berkley
i
have
written
to
direct
arkins
and
two
or
three
of
the
other
servants
to
go
down
at
once
set
them
all
to
work
immediately
he
then
applied
himself
to
another
letter
of
considerably
greater
length
and
from
which
therefore
we
shall
only
offer
a
few
extracts
it
was
addressed
to
john
skelton
and
began
as
my
dear
skelton
you
are
doubtless
surprised
at
my
long
silence
but
i
have
had
nothing
very
particular
to
say
my
visit
to
this
dull
and
uncomfortable
place
was
as
you
rightly
surmise
not
without
its
object
a
little
bit
of
wicked
romance
the
pretty
demoiselle
of
rouen
whom
i
mentioned
to
you
more
than
once
la
belle
de
barras
was
in
truth
the
attraction
that
drew
me
hither
and
i
think
for
as
yet
she
affects
hesitation
i
shall
have
no
further
trouble
with
her
she
is
a
fine
creature
and
you
will
admit
when
you
have
seen
her
well
worth
taking
some
trouble
about
she
is
however
a
very
knowing
little
minx
and
evidently
suspects
me
of
being
a
sad
fickle
dog
and
as
i
surmise
has
some
plans
moreover
respecting
my
morose
cousin
marston
a
kind
of
wicked
penruddock
who
has
carried
all
his
london
tastes
into
his
savage
retreat
a
paradise
of
bogs
and
bushes
there
is
i
am
very
confident
a
liaison
in
that
quarter
the
young
lady
is
evidently
a
good
deal
afraid
of
him
and
insists
upon
such
precautions
in
our
interviews
that
they
have
been
very
few
and
far
between
indeed
today
there
has
been
a
fracas
of
some
kind
i
have
no
doubt
that
marston
poor
devil
is
jealous
his
situation
is
really
pitiably
comic
with
an
intriguing
mistress
a
saintly
wife
and
a
devil
of
a
jealous
temper
of
his
own
i
shall
meet
mary
on
reaching
town
has
clavering
shabby
dog
paid
his
yet
tell
the
little
opera
woman
she
had
better
be
quiet
she
ought
to
know
me
by
this
time
i
shall
do
what
is
right
but
wo
submit
to
be
bullied
if
she
is
troublesome
snap
your
fingers
at
her
on
my
behalf
and
leave
her
to
her
remedy
i
have
written
to
gray
to
get
things
at
wynston
in
order
she
will
draw
upon
you
for
what
money
she
requires
send
down
two
or
three
of
the
servants
if
they
have
not
already
gone
the
place
is
very
dusty
and
dingy
and
needs
a
great
deal
of
brushing
and
scouring
i
shall
see
you
in
town
very
soon
by
the
way
has
the
claret
i
ordered
from
the
dublin
house
arrived
yet
it
is
consigned
to
you
and
goes
by
the
pay
the
freightage
and
get
edwards
to
pack
it
ten
dozen
or
so
may
as
well
go
down
to
wynston
and
send
other
wines
in
proportion
i
leave
details
to
you
some
further
directions
upon
other
subjects
followed
and
having
subscribed
the
dispatch
and
addressed
it
to
the
gentlemanlike
scoundrel
who
filled
the
onerous
office
of
factotum
to
this
profligate
and
exacting
man
of
the
world
sir
wynston
berkley
rang
his
bell
and
gave
the
two
letters
into
the
hand
of
his
man
with
special
directions
to
carry
them
himself
in
person
to
the
post
office
in
the
neighboring
village
early
next
morning
these
little
matters
completed
sir
wynston
stirred
his
fire
leaned
back
in
his
easy
chair
and
smiled
blandly
over
the
sunny
prospect
of
his
imaginary
triumphs
it
here
becomes
necessary
to
describe
in
a
few
words
some
of
the
local
relations
of
sir
wynston
apartments
the
bedchamber
which
he
occupied
opened
from
the
long
passage
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
and
there
were
two
other
smaller
apartments
opening
from
it
in
train
in
the
further
of
these
which
was
entered
from
a
lobby
communicating
by
a
back
stair
with
the
kitchen
and
servants
apartments
lay
sir
wynston
valet
and
the
intermediate
chamber
was
fitted
up
as
a
dressing
room
for
the
baronet
himself
these
circumstances
it
is
necessary
to
mention
that
what
follows
may
be
clearly
intelligible
while
the
baronet
was
penning
these
records
of
vicious
schemes
dire
waste
of
wealth
and
time
irrevocable
time
marston
paced
his
study
in
a
very
different
frame
of
mind
there
were
a
gloom
and
disorder
in
the
room
accordant
with
those
of
his
own
mind
shelves
of
ancient
tomes
darkened
by
time
and
upon
which
the
dust
of
years
lay
sleeping
dark
oaken
cabinets
filled
with
piles
of
deeds
and
papers
among
which
the
nimble
spiders
were
crawling
and
from
the
dusky
walls
several
stark
pale
ancestors
looking
down
coldly
from
their
tarnished
frames
an
hour
and
another
hour
passed
and
still
marston
paced
this
melancholy
chamber
a
prey
to
his
own
fell
passions
and
dark
thoughts
he
was
not
a
superstitious
man
but
in
the
visions
which
haunted
him
perhaps
was
something
which
made
him
unusually
excitable
for
he
experienced
a
chill
of
absolute
horror
as
standing
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
entrance
he
beheld
the
door
noiselessly
and
slowly
pushed
open
by
a
pale
thin
hand
and
a
figure
dressed
in
a
loose
white
robe
glide
softly
in
he
stood
for
some
seconds
gazing
upon
this
apparition
as
it
moved
hesitatingly
towards
him
from
the
dusky
extremity
of
the
large
apartment
before
he
perceived
that
the
form
was
that
of
marston
hey
ha
mrs
marston
what
on
earth
has
called
you
hither
he
asked
sternly
you
ought
to
have
been
at
rest
an
hour
ago
get
to
your
chamber
and
leave
me
i
have
business
to
attend
to
now
dear
richard
you
must
forgive
me
she
said
drawing
near
and
looking
up
into
his
haggard
face
with
a
sweet
and
touching
look
of
timidity
and
love
i
could
not
rest
until
i
saw
you
again
your
looks
have
been
all
this
night
so
unlike
yourself
so
strange
and
terrible
that
i
am
afraid
some
great
misfortune
threatens
you
which
you
fear
to
tell
me
of
my
looks
why
curse
it
must
i
give
an
account
of
my
looks
replied
marston
at
once
disconcerted
and
wrathful
misfortune
what
misfortune
can
befall
us
more
no
there
is
nothing
nothing
i
say
but
your
own
foolish
fancy
go
to
your
room
go
to
sleep
my
looks
indeed
pshaw
i
came
to
tell
you
dear
richard
that
i
will
do
in
all
respects
just
as
you
desire
if
you
continue
to
wish
it
i
will
part
with
poor
mademoiselle
though
indeed
richard
i
shall
miss
her
more
than
you
can
imagine
and
all
your
suspicions
have
wronged
her
deeply
said
marston
her
husband
darted
a
sudden
flashing
glance
of
suspicious
scrutiny
upon
her
face
but
its
expression
was
frank
earnest
noble
he
was
disarmed
he
hung
his
head
gloomily
upon
his
breast
and
was
silent
for
a
time
she
came
nearer
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
he
looked
darkly
into
her
upturned
eyes
and
a
feeling
which
had
not
touched
his
heart
for
many
a
day
an
emotion
of
pity
transient
indeed
but
vivid
revisited
him
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
said
in
gentler
terms
than
she
had
heard
him
use
for
a
long
time
no
indeed
gertrude
you
have
deceived
yourself
no
misfortune
has
happened
and
if
i
am
gloomy
the
source
of
all
my
troubles
is
within
leave
me
gertrude
for
the
present
as
to
the
other
matter
the
departure
of
mademoiselle
de
barras
we
can
talk
of
that
tomorrow
now
i
can
not
so
let
us
part
go
to
your
room
good
night
she
was
withdrawing
and
he
added
in
a
subdued
tone
gertrude
i
am
very
glad
you
came
very
glad
pray
for
me
tonight
he
had
followed
her
a
few
steps
toward
the
door
and
now
stopped
short
turned
about
and
walked
dejectedly
back
again
i
am
right
glad
she
came
he
muttered
as
soon
as
he
was
once
more
alone
wynston
is
provoking
and
fiery
too
were
i
in
my
present
mood
to
seek
a
with
him
who
knows
what
might
come
of
it
blood
my
own
heart
whispers
blood
i
not
trust
myself
he
strode
to
the
study
door
locked
it
and
taking
out
the
key
shut
it
in
the
drawer
of
one
of
the
cabinets
now
it
will
need
more
than
accident
or
impulse
to
lead
me
to
him
i
can
not
go
at
least
without
reflection
without
premeditation
avaunt
fiend
i
have
baffled
you
he
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
cowering
and
scowling
as
he
said
this
and
looked
round
with
a
glance
as
if
he
expected
to
see
some
dreadful
form
in
the
dusky
recesses
of
the
desolate
chamber
he
sat
himself
by
the
smouldering
fire
in
somber
and
agitated
rumination
he
was
restless
he
rose
again
unbuckled
his
sword
which
he
had
not
loosed
since
evening
and
threw
it
hastily
into
a
corner
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
twelve
he
glanced
at
the
door
and
thence
at
the
cabinet
in
which
he
had
placed
the
key
then
he
turned
hastily
and
sate
down
again
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
upon
his
clenched
hand
still
he
was
restless
and
excited
once
more
he
arose
and
paced
up
and
down
he
consulted
his
watch
again
it
was
now
but
a
quarter
to
one
sir
wynston
man
having
received
the
letters
and
his
permission
to
retire
to
rest
got
into
his
bed
and
was
soon
beginning
to
dose
we
have
already
mentioned
that
his
and
sir
wynston
apartments
were
separated
by
a
small
dressing
room
so
that
any
ordinary
noise
or
conversation
could
be
heard
but
imperfectly
from
one
to
the
other
the
servant
however
was
startled
by
a
sound
of
something
falling
on
the
floor
of
his
master
apartment
and
broken
to
pieces
by
the
violence
of
the
shock
he
sate
up
in
his
bed
listened
and
heard
some
sentences
spoken
vehemently
and
gabbled
very
fast
he
thought
he
distinguished
the
words
wretch
and
god
and
there
was
something
so
strange
in
the
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
that
the
man
got
up
and
stole
noiselessly
through
the
dressing
room
and
listened
at
the
door
he
heard
him
as
he
thought
walking
in
his
slippers
through
the
room
and
making
his
customary
arrangements
previously
to
getting
into
bed
he
knew
that
his
master
had
a
habit
of
speaking
when
alone
and
concluded
that
the
accidental
breakage
of
some
glass
or
had
elicited
the
volley
of
words
he
had
heard
well
knowing
that
except
at
the
usual
hours
or
in
obedience
to
sir
wynston
bell
nothing
more
displeased
his
master
than
his
presuming
to
enter
his
while
he
was
there
the
servant
quietly
retreated
and
perfectly
satisfied
that
all
was
right
composed
himself
to
slumber
and
was
soon
beginning
to
dose
again
the
adventures
of
the
night
however
were
not
yet
over
waking
as
men
sometimes
do
without
any
ascertainable
cause
without
a
start
or
an
uneasy
sensation
without
even
a
disturbance
of
the
attitude
of
repose
he
opened
his
eyes
and
beheld
merton
the
servant
of
whom
we
have
spoken
standing
at
a
little
distance
from
his
bed
the
moonlight
fell
in
a
clear
flood
upon
this
figure
the
man
was
ghastly
pale
there
was
a
blotch
of
blood
on
his
face
his
hands
were
clasped
upon
something
which
they
nearly
concealed
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
servant
who
had
just
awakened
shone
in
the
cold
light
with
a
wild
and
lifeless
glitter
this
specter
drew
close
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
there
with
a
look
of
agony
and
menace
which
startled
the
man
who
rose
upright
and
said
merton
merton
in
god
name
what
is
the
matter
merton
recoiled
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
as
he
did
so
dropped
something
on
the
floor
which
rolled
away
to
a
distance
and
he
stood
gazing
silently
and
horribly
upon
his
interrogator
merton
i
say
what
is
it
urged
the
man
are
you
hurt
your
face
is
bloody
merton
raised
his
hand
to
his
face
mechanically
and
sir
wynston
man
observed
that
it
too
was
covered
with
blood
why
man
he
said
vehemently
and
actually
freezing
with
horror
you
are
all
bloody
hands
and
face
all
over
blood
my
hand
is
cut
to
the
bone
said
merton
in
a
harsh
whisper
and
speaking
to
himself
rather
than
addressing
the
servant
i
wish
it
was
my
neck
i
wish
to
god
i
bled
to
death
you
have
hurt
your
hand
merton
repeated
the
man
scarce
knowing
what
he
said
aye
whispered
merton
wildly
drawing
toward
the
bedside
again
who
told
you
i
hurt
my
hand
it
is
cut
to
the
bone
sure
enough
he
stooped
for
a
moment
over
the
bed
and
then
cowered
down
toward
the
floor
to
search
for
what
he
had
dropped
why
merton
what
brings
you
here
at
this
hour
urged
the
man
after
a
pause
of
a
few
seconds
it
is
drawing
toward
morning
aye
aye
said
merton
doubtfully
and
starting
upright
again
while
he
concealed
in
his
bosom
what
he
had
been
in
search
of
near
morning
is
it
night
and
morning
it
is
all
one
to
me
i
believe
i
am
going
mad
by
but
what
do
you
want
what
did
you
come
here
for
at
this
hour
persisted
the
man
what
aye
that
is
it
why
his
boots
and
spurs
to
be
sure
i
forgot
them
his
his
sir
wynston
boots
and
spurs
i
forgot
to
take
them
i
say
said
merton
looking
toward
the
dressing
room
as
if
about
to
enter
it
do
mind
them
tonight
i
say
do
go
in
there
said
the
man
peremptorily
and
getting
out
upon
the
floor
i
say
merton
this
is
no
hour
to
be
going
about
searching
in
the
dark
for
boots
and
spurs
you
waken
the
master
i
ca
have
it
i
say
go
down
and
let
it
be
for
tonight
thus
speaking
in
a
resolute
and
somewhat
angry
the
valet
stood
between
merton
and
the
entrance
of
the
and
signing
with
his
hand
toward
the
other
door
of
the
apartment
continued
go
down
i
say
merton
go
down
you
may
as
well
quietly
for
i
tell
you
plainly
you
shall
neither
go
a
step
further
nor
stay
here
a
moment
longer
the
man
drew
his
shoulders
up
and
made
a
sort
of
shivering
moan
and
clasping
his
hands
together
shook
them
as
it
seemed
in
great
agony
he
then
turned
abruptly
and
hurried
from
the
room
by
the
door
leading
to
the
kitchen
by
my
faith
said
the
servant
i
am
glad
he
is
gone
the
poor
chap
is
turning
crazy
as
sure
as
i
am
a
living
man
i
not
have
him
prowling
about
here
anymore
however
that
i
am
resolved
on
in
pursuance
of
this
determination
by
no
means
an
imprudent
one
as
it
seemed
he
fastened
the
door
communicating
with
the
lower
apartments
upon
the
inside
he
had
hardly
done
this
when
he
heard
a
step
traversing
the
which
lay
under
the
window
of
his
apartment
he
looked
out
and
saw
merton
walking
hurriedly
across
and
into
a
stable
at
the
farther
end
feeling
no
very
particular
curiosity
about
his
movements
the
man
hurried
back
to
his
bed
merton
eccentric
conduct
of
late
had
become
so
generally
remarked
and
discussed
among
the
servants
that
sir
man
was
by
no
means
surprised
at
the
oddity
of
the
visit
he
had
just
had
nor
after
the
first
few
moments
of
doubt
before
the
appearance
of
blood
had
been
accounted
for
had
he
entertained
any
suspicions
whatever
connected
with
the
man
unexpected
presence
in
the
room
merton
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
up
every
night
to
take
down
sir
wynston
boots
whenever
the
baronet
had
ridden
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
this
attention
had
been
civilly
undertaken
as
a
proof
of
toward
the
valet
whose
duty
this
somewhat
soiling
and
ungentlemanlike
process
would
otherwise
have
been
so
far
the
nature
of
the
visit
was
explained
and
the
remembrance
of
the
friendly
feeling
and
good
offices
which
had
been
mutually
interchanged
as
well
as
of
the
inoffensive
habits
for
which
merton
had
earned
a
character
for
himself
speedily
calmed
the
uneasiness
for
a
moment
amounting
to
actual
alarm
with
which
the
servant
had
regarded
his
appearance
we
must
now
pass
on
to
the
morrow
and
ask
the
reader
attention
for
a
few
moments
to
a
different
scene
in
contact
with
gray
forest
upon
the
northern
side
and
divided
by
a
common
boundary
lay
a
demesne
in
many
respects
presenting
a
very
striking
contrast
to
its
grander
neighbor
it
was
a
comparatively
modern
place
it
could
not
boast
the
towering
timber
which
enriched
and
overshadowed
the
vast
and
varied
expanse
of
its
aristocratic
rival
but
if
it
was
inferior
in
the
advantages
of
antiquity
and
perhaps
also
in
some
of
those
of
nature
its
superiority
in
other
respects
was
striking
and
important
gray
forest
was
not
more
remarkable
for
its
wild
and
neglected
condition
than
was
newton
park
for
the
care
and
elegance
with
which
it
was
kept
no
one
could
observe
the
contrast
without
at
the
same
time
divining
its
cause
the
proprietor
of
the
one
was
a
man
of
wealth
fully
commensurate
with
the
extent
and
pretensions
of
the
residence
he
had
chosen
the
owner
of
the
other
was
a
man
of
broken
fortunes
under
a
green
shade
which
nearly
met
above
a
very
young
man
scarcely
of
a
frank
and
sensible
rather
than
a
strictly
handsome
countenance
was
walking
followed
by
half
a
dozen
dogs
of
as
many
breeds
and
sizes
this
young
man
was
george
mervyn
the
only
son
of
the
present
proprietor
of
the
place
as
he
approached
the
great
gate
the
clank
of
a
horse
hoofs
in
quick
motion
upon
the
sequestered
road
which
ran
outside
it
reached
him
and
hardly
had
he
heard
these
sounds
when
a
young
gentleman
rode
briskly
by
directing
his
look
into
the
demesne
as
he
passed
he
had
no
sooner
seen
him
than
wheeling
his
horse
about
he
rode
up
to
the
iron
gate
and
dismounting
threw
it
open
and
let
his
horse
in
ha
charles
marston
i
protest
said
the
young
man
quickening
his
pace
to
meet
his
friend
marston
my
dear
fellow
he
called
aloud
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
there
was
another
entrance
into
newton
park
opening
from
the
same
road
about
half
a
mile
further
on
and
charles
marston
made
his
way
lie
through
this
thus
the
young
people
walked
on
talking
of
a
hundred
things
as
they
proceeded
in
the
mirth
of
their
hearts
between
the
fathers
of
the
two
young
men
who
thus
walked
so
affectionately
together
there
subsisted
unhappily
no
friendly
feelings
there
had
been
several
slight
disagreements
between
them
touching
their
proprietary
rights
and
one
of
these
had
ripened
into
a
formal
and
somewhat
expensive
litigation
respecting
a
certain
right
of
fishing
claimed
by
each
this
legal
encounter
had
terminated
in
the
defeat
of
marston
mervyn
however
promptly
wrote
to
his
opponent
offering
him
the
free
use
of
the
waters
for
which
they
had
thus
sharply
contested
and
received
a
curt
and
scarcely
civil
reply
declining
the
proposed
courtesy
this
exhibition
of
resentment
on
marston
part
had
been
followed
by
some
rather
angry
collisions
where
chance
or
duty
happened
to
throw
them
together
it
is
but
justice
to
say
that
upon
all
such
occasions
marston
was
the
aggressor
but
mervyn
was
a
somewhat
testy
old
gentleman
and
had
a
certain
pride
of
his
own
which
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
thus
though
near
neighbors
the
parents
of
the
young
friends
were
more
than
strangers
to
each
other
on
mervyn
side
however
this
estrangement
was
unalloyed
with
bitterness
and
simply
of
that
kind
which
the
great
moralist
would
have
referred
to
defensive
pride
it
did
not
include
any
member
of
marston
family
and
charles
as
often
as
he
desired
it
which
was
in
truth
as
often
as
his
visits
could
escape
the
special
notice
of
his
father
was
a
welcome
guest
at
newton
park
these
details
respecting
the
mutual
relation
in
which
the
two
families
stood
it
was
necessary
to
state
for
the
purpose
of
making
what
follows
perfectly
clear
the
young
people
had
now
reached
the
further
gate
at
which
they
were
to
part
charles
marston
with
a
heart
beating
happily
in
the
anticipation
of
many
a
pleasant
meeting
bid
him
farewell
for
the
present
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
was
riding
up
the
broad
straight
avenue
towards
the
gloomy
mansion
which
closed
in
the
hazy
and
somber
perspective
as
he
moved
onward
he
passed
a
laborer
with
whose
face
from
his
childhood
he
had
been
familiar
how
do
you
do
tom
he
cried
at
your
service
sir
replied
the
man
uncovering
and
welcome
home
sir
there
was
something
dark
and
anxious
in
the
man
looks
which
with
the
welcome
he
spoke
and
which
suggested
some
undefined
alarm
the
master
and
mistress
and
miss
rhoda
are
all
well
he
asked
eagerly
all
well
sir
thank
god
replied
the
man
young
marston
spurred
on
filled
with
vague
apprehensions
and
observing
the
man
still
leaning
upon
his
spade
and
watching
his
progress
with
the
same
gloomy
and
curious
eye
at
the
he
met
with
one
of
the
servants
booted
and
spurred
well
daly
he
said
as
he
dismounted
how
are
all
at
home
this
man
like
the
former
met
his
smile
with
a
troubled
countenance
and
stammered
all
sir
that
is
the
master
and
mistress
and
miss
rhoda
quite
well
sir
but
well
well
said
charles
eagerly
speak
on
what
is
it
bad
work
sir
replied
the
man
lowering
his
voice
i
am
going
off
this
minute
for
for
what
urged
the
young
gentleman
why
sir
for
the
coroner
replied
he
the
coroner
the
coroner
why
good
god
what
has
happened
cried
charles
aghast
with
horror
sir
wynston
commenced
the
man
and
hesitated
well
pursued
charles
pale
and
breathless
sir
wynston
he
it
is
he
said
the
man
he
sir
wynston
is
he
dead
or
who
is
who
is
dead
demanded
the
young
man
almost
fiercely
sir
wynston
sir
it
is
he
that
is
dead
there
is
bad
work
sir
very
bad
i
afraid
replied
the
man
charles
did
not
wait
to
inquire
further
but
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
horror
and
curiosity
entered
the
house
he
hurried
up
the
stairs
and
entered
his
mother
sitting
room
she
was
there
perfectly
alone
and
so
deadly
pale
that
she
scarcely
looked
like
a
living
being
in
an
instant
they
were
locked
in
one
another
arms
mother
my
dear
mother
you
are
ill
said
the
young
man
anxiously
oh
no
no
dear
charles
but
frightened
horrified
and
as
she
said
this
the
poor
lady
burst
into
tears
what
is
this
horrible
affair
something
about
sir
wynston
he
is
dead
i
know
but
is
it
is
it
suicide
he
asked
oh
no
not
suicide
said
marston
greatly
agitated
good
god
then
he
is
murdered
whispered
the
young
man
growing
very
pale
yes
charles
horrible
dreadful
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
replied
she
shuddering
while
she
wept
where
is
my
father
inquired
the
young
man
after
a
pause
why
why
charles
darling
why
do
you
ask
for
him
she
said
wildly
grasping
him
by
the
arm
as
she
looked
into
his
face
with
a
terrified
expression
why
why
he
could
tell
me
the
particulars
of
this
horrible
tragedy
answered
he
meeting
her
agonized
look
with
one
of
alarm
and
surprise
as
far
as
they
have
been
as
yet
collected
how
is
he
mother
is
he
well
oh
yes
quite
well
thank
god
she
answered
more
collectedly
quite
well
but
of
course
greatly
dreadfully
shocked
i
will
go
to
him
mother
i
will
see
him
said
he
turning
towards
the
door
he
has
been
wretchedly
depressed
and
excited
for
some
days
said
marston
dejectedly
and
this
dreadful
occurrence
will
i
fear
affect
him
most
deplorably
the
young
man
kissed
her
tenderly
and
affectionately
and
hurried
down
to
the
library
where
his
father
usually
sat
when
he
desired
to
be
alone
or
was
engaged
in
business
he
opened
the
door
softly
his
father
was
standing
at
one
of
the
windows
his
face
haggard
as
from
a
watching
unkempt
and
unshorn
and
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
at
the
sound
of
the
revolving
door
he
started
and
seeing
his
son
first
recoiled
a
little
with
a
strange
doubtful
expression
and
then
rallying
walked
quickly
towards
him
with
a
smile
which
had
in
it
something
still
more
painful
charles
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
said
shaking
him
with
an
agitated
pressure
by
both
hands
charles
this
is
a
great
calamity
and
what
makes
it
still
worse
is
that
the
murderer
has
escaped
it
looks
badly
you
know
he
fixed
his
gaze
for
a
few
moments
upon
his
son
turned
abruptly
and
walked
a
little
way
into
the
room
then
in
a
disconcerted
manner
he
added
hastily
turning
back
not
that
it
signifies
to
us
of
course
but
i
would
fain
have
justice
satisfied
and
who
is
the
wretch
the
murderer
inquired
charles
who
why
everyone
knows
that
scoundrel
merton
answered
marston
in
an
irritated
tone
merton
murdered
him
in
his
bed
and
fled
last
night
he
is
gone
escaped
and
i
suspect
sir
wynston
man
of
being
an
accessory
which
was
sir
wynston
bedroom
asked
the
young
man
the
room
that
old
lady
mostyn
had
the
room
with
the
portrait
of
grace
hamilton
in
it
i
know
i
know
said
the
young
man
much
excited
i
should
wish
to
see
it
stay
said
marston
the
door
from
the
passage
is
bolted
on
the
inside
and
i
have
locked
the
other
here
is
the
key
if
you
choose
to
go
but
you
must
bring
hughes
with
you
and
do
not
disturb
anything
leave
all
as
it
is
the
jury
ought
to
see
and
examine
for
themselves
charles
took
the
key
and
accompanied
by
the
awestruck
servant
he
made
his
way
by
the
back
stairs
to
the
door
opening
from
the
which
as
we
have
said
intervened
between
the
valet
chamber
and
sir
wynston
after
a
momentary
hesitation
charles
turned
the
key
in
the
door
and
stood
in
the
dark
chamber
of
white
death
the
shutters
lay
partly
open
as
the
valet
had
left
them
some
hours
before
on
making
the
astounding
discovery
which
the
partially
admitted
light
revealed
the
corpse
lay
in
the
dressing
gown
and
other
habiliments
which
sir
wynston
had
worn
while
taking
his
ease
in
his
chamber
on
the
preceding
night
the
coverlet
was
partially
dragged
over
it
the
mouth
was
gaping
and
filled
with
clotted
blood
a
wide
gash
was
also
visible
in
the
neck
under
the
ear
and
there
was
a
thickening
pool
of
blood
at
the
bedside
and
quantities
of
blood
doubtless
from
other
wounds
had
saturated
the
bedclothes
under
the
body
there
lay
sir
wynston
stiffened
in
the
attitude
in
which
the
struggle
of
death
had
left
him
with
his
stern
stony
face
and
dim
terrible
gaze
turned
up
charles
looked
breathlessly
for
more
than
a
minute
upon
this
mute
and
unchanging
spectacle
and
then
silently
suffered
the
curtain
to
fall
back
again
and
stepped
with
the
light
tread
of
awe
again
to
the
door
there
he
turned
back
and
pausing
for
a
minute
said
in
a
whisper
to
the
attendant
and
merton
did
this
troth
i
afeard
he
did
sir
answered
the
man
gloomily
and
has
made
his
escape
continued
charles
yes
sir
he
stole
away
in
the
replied
the
servant
after
the
murder
was
done
and
he
glanced
fearfully
toward
the
bed
god
knows
where
he
gone
the
villain
muttered
charles
but
what
was
his
motive
why
did
he
do
all
this
what
does
it
mean
i
do
know
exactly
sir
but
he
was
very
queer
for
a
week
and
more
before
it
replied
the
man
there
was
something
bad
over
him
for
a
long
time
it
is
a
terrible
thing
said
charles
with
a
profound
sigh
a
terrible
and
shocking
occurrence
he
hesitated
again
at
the
door
but
his
feelings
had
sustained
a
terrible
revulsion
at
sight
of
the
corpse
and
he
was
no
longer
disposed
to
prosecute
his
purposed
examination
of
the
chamber
and
its
contents
with
a
view
to
conjecturing
the
probable
circumstances
of
the
murder
observe
hughes
that
i
have
moved
nothing
in
the
chamber
from
the
place
it
occupied
when
we
entered
he
said
to
the
servant
as
they
withdrew
he
locked
the
door
and
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
on
his
return
he
encountered
his
father
and
restoring
the
key
said
i
could
not
stay
there
i
am
almost
sorry
i
have
seen
it
i
am
overpowered
what
a
determined
ferocious
murder
it
was
the
place
is
all
in
a
pool
of
gore
he
must
have
received
many
wounds
i
ca
say
the
particulars
will
be
elicited
soon
enough
those
details
are
for
the
inquest
as
for
me
i
hate
such
spectacles
said
marston
gloomily
go
now
and
see
your
sister
you
will
find
her
there
he
pointed
to
the
small
room
where
we
have
first
seen
her
and
her
fair
governess
charles
obeyed
the
direction
and
marston
proceeded
himself
to
his
wife
sitting
room
the
young
man
dispirited
and
horrified
by
the
awful
spectacle
he
had
just
contemplated
hurried
to
the
little
study
occupied
by
his
sister
marston
himself
ascended
as
we
have
said
the
great
staircase
leading
to
his
wife
private
sitting
room
marston
he
said
entering
this
is
a
hateful
occurrence
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
taken
place
here
i
do
mean
to
affect
grief
which
i
do
feel
but
the
thing
is
very
shocking
and
particularly
so
as
having
occurred
under
my
roof
but
that
can
not
now
be
helped
i
have
resolved
to
spare
no
exertions
and
no
influence
to
bring
the
assassin
to
justice
and
a
coroner
jury
will
within
a
few
hours
sift
the
evidence
which
we
have
succeeded
in
collecting
but
my
purpose
in
seeking
you
now
is
to
recur
to
the
conversation
we
yesterday
had
respecting
a
member
of
this
establishment
mademoiselle
de
barras
suggested
the
lady
yes
mademoiselle
de
barras
echoed
marston
i
wish
to
say
that
having
reconsidered
the
circumstances
affecting
her
i
am
absolutely
resolved
that
she
shall
not
continue
to
be
an
inmate
of
this
house
he
paused
and
marston
said
well
richard
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
for
it
but
your
decision
shall
never
be
disputed
by
me
of
course
said
marston
drily
and
therefore
the
sooner
you
acquaint
her
with
it
and
let
her
know
that
she
must
go
the
better
having
said
this
he
left
her
and
went
to
his
own
chamber
where
he
proceeded
to
make
his
toilet
with
elaborate
propriety
in
preparation
for
the
scene
which
was
about
to
take
place
under
his
roof
marston
meanwhile
suffered
from
a
horrible
uncertainty
she
never
harbored
it
is
true
one
doubt
as
to
her
husband
perfect
innocence
of
the
ghastly
crime
which
filled
their
house
with
fear
and
gloom
but
at
the
same
time
that
she
thoroughly
and
indignantly
scouted
the
possibility
of
his
under
any
circumstances
being
accessory
to
such
a
crime
she
experienced
a
nervous
and
agonizing
anxiety
lest
anyone
else
should
possibly
suspect
him
however
obliquely
and
faintly
of
any
participation
whatever
in
the
foul
deed
this
vague
fear
tortured
her
it
had
taken
possession
of
her
mind
and
it
was
the
more
acutely
painful
because
it
was
of
a
kind
which
precluded
the
possibility
of
her
dispelling
it
as
morbid
fears
so
often
are
dispelled
by
taking
counsel
upon
its
suggestions
with
a
friend
the
day
wore
on
and
strange
faces
began
to
fill
the
great
parlor
the
coroner
accompanied
by
a
physician
had
arrived
several
of
the
gentry
in
the
immediate
vicinity
had
been
summoned
as
jurors
and
now
began
to
arrive
in
succession
marston
in
a
handsome
and
sober
suit
received
these
visitors
with
a
stately
and
melancholy
courtesy
befitting
the
occasion
mervyn
and
his
son
had
both
been
summoned
and
of
course
were
in
attendance
there
being
now
a
sufficient
number
to
form
a
jury
they
were
sworn
and
immediately
proceeded
to
the
chamber
where
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
was
lying
marston
accompanied
them
and
with
a
pale
and
stern
countenance
and
in
a
clear
and
subdued
tone
called
their
attention
successively
to
every
particular
detail
which
he
conceived
important
to
be
noted
having
thus
employed
some
minutes
the
jury
again
returned
to
the
parlor
and
the
examination
of
the
witnesses
commenced
marston
at
his
own
request
was
first
sworn
and
examined
he
deposed
merely
to
the
circumstance
of
his
parting
on
the
night
previous
with
sir
wynston
and
to
the
state
in
which
he
had
seen
the
room
and
the
body
in
the
morning
he
mentioned
also
the
fact
that
on
hearing
the
alarm
in
the
morning
he
had
hastened
from
his
own
chamber
to
sir
wynston
and
found
on
trying
to
enter
that
the
door
opening
upon
the
passage
was
secured
on
the
inside
this
circumstance
showed
that
the
murderer
must
have
made
his
egress
at
least
through
the
valet
chamber
and
by
the
marston
evidence
went
no
further
the
next
witness
sworn
was
edward
smith
the
servant
of
the
late
sir
wynston
berkley
his
evidence
was
a
narrative
of
the
occurrences
we
have
already
stated
he
described
the
sounds
which
he
had
overheard
from
his
master
room
the
subsequent
appearance
of
merton
and
the
conversation
which
had
passed
between
them
he
then
proceeded
to
mention
that
it
was
his
master
custom
to
have
himself
called
at
seven
at
which
hour
he
usually
took
some
medicine
which
it
was
the
valet
duty
to
bring
to
him
after
which
he
either
settled
again
to
rest
or
rose
in
a
short
time
if
unable
to
sleep
having
measured
and
prepared
the
dose
in
the
dressing
room
the
servant
went
on
to
say
he
had
knocked
at
his
master
door
and
receiving
no
answer
had
entered
the
room
and
partly
unclosed
the
shutters
he
perceived
the
blood
on
the
carpet
and
on
opening
the
curtains
saw
his
master
lying
with
his
mouth
and
eyes
open
perfectly
dead
and
weltering
in
gore
he
had
stretched
out
his
hand
and
seized
that
of
the
dead
man
which
was
quite
stiff
and
cold
then
losing
heart
he
had
run
to
the
door
communicating
with
the
passage
but
found
it
locked
and
turned
to
the
other
entrance
and
ran
down
the
crying
murder
hughes
the
butler
and
james
carney
another
servant
came
immediately
and
they
all
three
went
back
into
the
room
the
key
was
in
the
outer
door
upon
the
inside
but
they
did
not
unlock
it
until
they
had
viewed
the
body
there
was
a
great
pool
of
blood
in
the
bed
and
in
it
was
lying
a
case
knife
which
was
produced
and
identified
by
the
witness
just
then
they
heard
marston
calling
for
admission
and
they
opened
the
door
with
some
difficulty
for
the
lock
was
rusty
marston
had
ordered
them
to
leave
the
things
as
they
were
and
had
used
very
stern
language
to
the
witness
they
had
then
left
the
room
securing
both
doors
this
witness
underwent
a
severe
and
searching
examination
but
his
evidence
was
clear
and
consistent
in
conclusion
marston
produced
a
dagger
which
was
stained
with
blood
and
asked
the
man
whether
he
recognized
it
smith
at
once
stated
this
to
have
been
the
property
of
his
late
master
who
when
traveling
carried
it
together
with
his
pistols
along
with
him
since
his
arrival
at
gray
forest
it
had
lain
upon
the
in
his
bedroom
where
he
believed
it
to
have
been
upon
the
previous
night
james
carney
one
of
marston
servants
was
next
sworn
and
examined
he
had
he
said
observed
a
strange
and
unaccountable
agitation
and
depression
in
merton
manner
for
some
days
past
he
had
also
been
several
times
disturbed
at
night
by
his
talking
aloud
to
himself
and
walking
to
and
fro
in
his
room
their
bedrooms
were
separated
by
a
thin
partition
in
which
was
a
window
through
which
carney
had
on
the
night
of
the
murder
observed
a
light
in
merton
room
and
on
looking
in
had
seen
him
dressing
hastily
he
also
saw
him
twice
take
up
and
again
lay
down
the
knife
which
had
been
found
in
the
bed
of
the
murdered
man
he
knew
it
by
the
handle
being
broken
near
the
end
he
had
no
suspicion
of
merton
having
any
mischievous
intentions
and
lay
down
again
to
rest
he
afterwards
heard
him
pass
out
of
his
room
and
go
slowly
up
the
leading
to
the
upper
story
shortly
after
this
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
did
not
hear
or
see
him
return
he
then
described
as
smith
had
already
done
the
scene
which
presented
itself
in
the
morning
on
his
accompanying
him
into
sir
wynston
bedchamber
the
next
witness
examined
was
a
little
irish
boy
who
described
himself
as
a
poor
scholar
his
testimony
was
somewhat
singular
he
deposed
that
he
had
come
to
the
house
on
the
preceding
evening
and
had
been
given
some
supper
and
was
afterwards
permitted
to
sleep
among
the
hay
in
one
of
the
lofts
he
had
however
discovered
what
he
considered
a
snugger
berth
this
was
an
unused
stable
in
the
further
end
of
which
lay
a
quantity
of
hay
among
this
he
had
lain
down
and
gone
to
sleep
he
was
however
awakened
in
the
course
of
the
night
by
the
entrance
of
a
man
whom
he
saw
with
perfect
distinctness
in
the
moonlight
and
his
description
of
his
dress
and
appearance
tallied
exactly
with
those
of
merton
this
man
occupied
himself
for
sometime
in
washing
his
hands
and
face
in
a
stable
bucket
which
happened
to
stand
by
the
door
and
during
the
whole
of
this
process
he
continued
to
moan
and
mutter
like
one
in
woeful
perturbation
he
said
distinctly
twice
or
thrice
by
i
am
done
for
and
every
now
and
then
he
muttered
and
nothing
for
it
after
all
when
he
had
done
washing
his
hands
he
took
something
from
his
and
looked
at
it
shaking
his
head
at
this
time
he
was
standing
with
his
back
turned
toward
the
boy
so
that
he
could
not
see
what
this
object
might
be
the
man
however
put
it
into
his
breast
and
then
began
to
search
hurriedly
as
it
seemed
for
some
hiding
place
for
it
after
looking
at
the
pavement
and
poking
at
the
chinks
of
the
wall
he
suddenly
went
to
the
window
and
forced
up
the
stone
which
formed
the
sill
under
this
he
threw
the
object
which
the
boy
had
seen
him
examine
with
so
much
perplexity
and
then
he
readjusted
the
stone
and
removed
the
evidences
of
its
having
been
recently
stirred
the
boy
was
a
little
frightened
but
very
curious
about
all
that
he
saw
and
when
the
man
left
the
stable
in
which
he
lay
he
got
up
and
following
to
the
door
peeped
after
him
he
saw
him
putting
on
an
and
hat
near
the
yard
gate
and
then
with
great
caution
unbolt
the
wicket
constantly
looking
back
towards
the
house
and
so
let
himself
out
the
boy
was
uneasy
and
sat
in
the
hay
until
morning
he
then
told
the
servants
what
he
had
seen
and
one
of
the
men
having
raised
the
stone
which
he
had
not
strength
to
lift
they
found
the
dagger
which
smith
had
identified
as
belonging
to
his
master
this
weapon
was
stained
with
blood
and
some
hair
which
was
found
to
correspond
in
color
with
sir
wynston
was
sticking
in
the
crevice
between
the
blade
and
the
handle
it
appears
very
strange
that
one
man
should
have
employed
two
distinct
instruments
of
this
kind
observed
mervyn
after
a
pause
a
silence
followed
yes
strange
it
does
seem
strange
said
marston
clearing
his
voice
yet
it
is
clear
said
another
of
the
jury
that
the
same
hand
did
employ
them
it
is
proved
that
the
knife
was
in
merton
possession
just
as
he
left
his
chamber
and
proved
also
that
the
dagger
was
secreted
by
him
after
he
quitted
the
house
yes
said
marston
with
a
grisly
sort
of
smile
and
glancing
sarcastically
at
mervyn
while
he
addressed
the
last
speaker
i
thank
you
for
recalling
my
attention
to
the
facts
it
certainly
is
not
a
very
pleasant
suggestion
that
there
still
remains
within
my
household
an
undetected
murderer
mervyn
ruminated
for
a
time
and
said
he
should
wish
to
put
a
few
more
questions
to
smith
and
carney
they
were
accordingly
recalled
and
examined
in
great
detail
with
a
view
to
ascertain
whether
any
indication
of
the
presence
of
a
second
person
having
visited
the
chamber
with
merton
was
discoverable
nothing
however
appeared
except
that
the
valet
mentioned
the
noise
and
the
exclamations
which
he
had
indistinctly
heard
you
did
not
mention
that
before
sir
said
marston
sharply
i
did
not
think
of
it
sir
replied
the
man
the
gentlemen
were
asking
me
so
many
questions
but
i
told
you
sir
about
it
in
the
morning
oh
ah
yes
yes
i
believe
you
did
said
marston
but
you
then
said
that
sir
wynston
often
talked
when
he
was
alone
eh
sir
yes
sir
and
so
he
used
which
was
the
reason
i
did
not
go
into
the
room
when
i
heard
it
replied
the
man
how
long
afterwards
was
it
when
you
saw
merton
in
your
own
room
asked
mervyn
i
could
not
say
sir
answered
smith
i
was
soon
asleep
and
ca
say
how
long
i
slept
before
he
came
was
it
an
hour
pursued
mervyn
i
ca
say
said
the
man
doubtfully
was
it
five
hours
asked
marston
no
sir
i
am
sure
it
was
not
five
could
you
swear
it
was
more
than
persisted
marston
no
i
could
not
swear
that
answered
he
i
am
afraid
mervyn
you
have
found
a
mare
nest
said
marston
contemptuously
i
have
done
my
duty
sir
retorted
mervyn
cynically
which
plainly
requires
that
i
shall
have
no
doubt
which
the
evidence
of
the
witness
can
clear
up
unsifted
and
unsatisfied
i
happened
to
think
it
of
some
moment
to
ascertain
if
possible
whether
more
persons
than
one
were
engaged
in
this
atrocious
murder
you
do
seem
to
think
the
question
so
important
a
one
different
men
sir
take
different
views
views
sir
in
matters
of
this
sort
especially
where
they
tend
to
multiply
suspicions
and
to
implicate
others
ought
to
be
supported
by
something
more
substantial
than
mere
fancies
retorted
marston
i
do
know
what
you
call
fancies
replied
mervyn
testily
but
here
are
two
deadly
weapons
a
knife
and
a
dagger
each
it
would
seem
employed
in
doing
this
murder
if
you
see
nothing
odd
in
that
i
enable
you
to
do
so
well
sir
said
marston
grimly
the
whole
thing
is
as
you
term
it
odd
and
i
can
see
no
object
in
your
picking
out
this
particular
singularity
for
criticism
except
to
cast
scandal
upon
my
household
by
leaving
a
hideous
and
vague
imputation
floating
among
the
members
of
it
sir
sir
this
is
a
foul
way
he
cried
sternly
to
gratify
a
paltry
spite
marston
said
mervyn
rising
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
while
he
confronted
him
to
the
full
as
sternly
the
country
knows
in
which
of
our
hearts
the
spite
if
any
there
be
between
us
is
harbored
i
owe
you
no
friendship
but
sir
i
cherish
no
malice
either
and
against
the
worst
enemy
i
have
on
earth
i
am
incapable
of
perverting
an
opportunity
like
this
and
inflicting
pain
under
the
pretence
of
discharging
a
duty
marston
was
on
the
point
of
retorting
but
the
coroner
interposed
and
besought
them
to
confine
their
attention
strictly
to
the
solemn
inquiry
which
they
were
summoned
together
to
prosecute
there
remained
still
to
be
examined
the
surgeon
who
had
accompanied
the
coroner
for
the
purpose
of
reporting
upon
the
extent
and
nature
of
the
injuries
discoverable
upon
the
person
of
the
deceased
he
accordingly
deposed
that
having
examined
the
body
he
found
no
less
than
three
deep
wounds
inflicted
with
some
sharp
instrument
two
of
them
had
actually
penetrated
the
heart
and
were
of
course
supposed
to
cause
instant
death
besides
these
there
were
two
contusions
one
upon
the
back
of
the
head
the
other
upon
the
forehead
with
a
slight
abrasion
of
the
eyebrow
there
was
a
large
lock
of
hair
torn
out
by
the
roots
at
the
front
of
the
head
and
the
palm
and
fingers
of
the
right
hand
were
cut
this
evidence
having
been
taken
the
jury
once
more
repaired
to
the
chamber
where
the
body
lay
and
proceeded
with
much
minuteness
to
examine
the
room
with
a
view
to
ascertain
if
possible
more
particularly
the
exact
circumstances
of
the
murder
the
result
of
this
elaborate
scrutiny
was
as
follows
the
deceased
they
conjectured
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
easy
chair
and
while
he
was
unconscious
the
murderer
had
stolen
into
the
room
and
before
attacking
his
victim
had
secured
the
upon
the
inside
this
was
argued
from
the
of
blood
upon
the
handle
or
any
other
part
of
the
door
it
was
supposed
that
he
had
then
approached
sir
wynston
with
the
view
either
of
robbing
or
of
murdering
him
while
he
slept
and
that
the
deceased
had
awakened
just
after
he
had
reached
him
that
a
brief
and
desperate
struggle
had
ensued
in
which
the
assailant
had
struck
his
victim
with
his
fist
upon
the
forehead
and
having
stunned
him
had
hurriedly
clutched
him
by
the
hair
and
stabbed
him
with
the
dagger
which
lay
close
by
upon
the
chimneypiece
forcing
his
head
violently
against
the
back
of
the
chair
this
part
of
the
conjecture
was
supported
by
the
circumstance
of
there
being
discovered
a
lock
of
hair
upon
the
ground
at
the
spot
and
a
good
deal
of
blood
the
carpet
too
was
tumbled
and
a
which
had
stood
upon
the
table
close
by
was
lying
in
fragments
upon
the
floor
it
was
supposed
that
the
murderer
had
then
dragged
the
body
to
the
bed
where
having
substituted
the
knife
which
he
had
probably
brought
to
the
room
in
the
same
pocket
from
which
the
boy
afterwards
saw
him
take
the
dagger
he
dispatched
him
and
either
hearing
some
alarm
perhaps
the
movement
of
the
valet
in
the
adjoining
room
or
from
some
other
cause
he
dropped
the
knife
in
the
bed
and
was
not
able
to
find
it
again
the
wounds
upon
the
hand
of
the
dead
man
indicated
his
having
caught
and
struggled
to
hold
the
blade
of
the
weapon
with
which
he
was
assailed
the
impression
of
a
bloody
hand
thrust
under
the
bolster
where
it
was
sir
habit
to
place
his
purse
and
watch
when
making
his
arrangements
for
the
night
supplied
the
motive
of
this
otherwise
unaccountable
atrocity
after
some
brief
consultation
the
jury
agreed
upon
a
verdict
of
willful
murder
against
john
merton
a
finding
of
which
the
coroner
expressed
his
entire
approbation
marston
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
had
informations
embodying
the
principal
part
of
the
evidence
given
before
the
coroner
sworn
against
merton
and
transmitted
a
copy
of
them
to
the
home
office
a
reward
for
the
apprehension
of
the
culprit
was
forthwith
offered
but
for
some
months
without
effect
marston
had
in
the
interval
written
to
several
of
sir
wynston
many
relations
announcing
the
catastrophe
and
requesting
that
steps
might
immediately
be
taken
to
have
the
body
removed
meanwhile
undertakers
were
busy
in
the
chamber
of
death
the
corpse
was
enclosed
in
lead
and
that
again
in
cedar
and
a
great
oak
shell
covered
with
crimson
cloth
and
goldheaded
nails
and
with
a
gilt
plate
recording
the
age
title
of
the
deceased
was
screwed
down
firmly
over
all
nearly
a
fortnight
elapsed
before
any
reply
to
marston
letters
was
received
a
short
epistle
at
last
arrived
from
lord
h
the
late
sir
wynston
uncle
deeply
regretting
the
sad
and
inexplicable
occurrence
and
adding
that
the
will
which
on
receipt
of
the
distressing
intelligence
was
immediately
opened
and
read
contained
no
direction
whatever
respecting
the
sepulture
of
the
deceased
which
had
therefore
better
be
completed
as
modestly
and
expeditiously
as
possible
in
the
neighborhood
and
in
conclusion
he
directed
that
the
accounts
of
the
undertakers
employed
upon
the
melancholy
occasion
might
be
sent
in
to
skelton
who
had
kindly
undertaken
to
leave
london
without
any
delay
for
the
purpose
of
completing
these
last
arrangements
and
who
would
in
any
matter
of
business
connected
with
the
deceased
represent
him
lord
h
as
executor
of
the
late
baronet
this
letter
was
followed
in
a
day
or
two
by
the
arrival
of
skelton
a
languid
impertinent
london
a
good
deal
faded
with
a
somewhat
sallow
and
puffy
face
charged
with
a
pleasant
combination
at
once
of
meanness
insolence
and
sensuality
just
such
a
person
as
sir
wynston
parasite
might
have
been
expected
to
prove
however
well
disposed
to
impress
the
natives
with
high
notions
of
his
extraordinary
refinement
and
importance
he
very
soon
discovered
that
in
marston
he
had
stumbled
upon
a
man
of
the
world
and
one
thoroughly
versed
in
the
ways
and
characters
of
london
life
after
some
ineffectual
attempts
therefore
to
overawe
and
astonish
his
host
skelton
became
aware
of
the
fruitlessness
of
the
effort
and
condescended
to
abate
somewhat
of
his
pretensions
marston
could
not
avoid
inviting
this
person
to
pass
the
night
at
his
house
an
invitation
which
was
accepted
of
course
and
next
morning
after
a
late
breakfast
skelton
observed
with
a
yawn
and
now
about
this
body
poor
berkley
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
him
i
have
no
proposition
to
make
said
marston
drily
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
except
that
the
body
may
be
removed
without
more
delay
i
have
no
suggestion
to
offer
h
notion
was
to
have
him
buried
as
near
the
spot
as
may
be
said
skelton
marston
nodded
there
is
a
kind
of
vault
is
not
there
in
the
demesne
a
family
inquired
the
visitor
yes
sir
replied
marston
curtly
well
drawled
skelton
well
sir
what
then
responded
marston
why
as
the
wish
of
the
parties
is
to
have
him
buried
poor
fellow
as
quietly
as
possible
i
think
he
might
just
as
well
be
laid
there
as
anywhere
else
had
i
desired
it
skelton
i
should
myself
have
made
the
offer
said
marston
abruptly
then
you
do
wish
it
said
skelton
no
sir
certainly
not
most
peremptorily
not
answered
marston
with
more
sharpness
than
in
his
early
days
he
would
have
thought
quite
consistent
with
politeness
perhaps
replied
skelton
for
want
of
something
better
to
say
and
with
a
callous
sort
of
levity
perhaps
you
hold
the
idea
some
people
do
that
murdered
men
ca
rest
in
their
graves
until
their
murderers
have
expiated
their
guilt
marston
made
no
reply
but
shot
two
or
three
lurid
glances
from
under
his
brow
at
the
speaker
well
then
at
all
events
continued
skelton
indolently
resuming
his
theme
if
you
decline
your
assistance
may
i
at
least
hope
for
your
advice
knowing
nothing
of
this
country
i
would
ask
you
whither
you
would
recommend
me
to
have
the
body
conveyed
i
do
care
to
advise
in
the
matter
said
marston
but
if
i
were
directing
i
should
have
the
remains
buried
in
chester
it
is
not
more
than
twenty
miles
from
this
and
if
at
any
future
time
his
family
should
desire
to
remove
the
body
it
could
be
effected
more
easily
from
thence
but
you
can
decide
egad
i
believe
you
are
right
said
skelton
glad
to
be
relieved
of
the
trouble
of
thinking
about
the
matter
and
i
shall
take
your
advice
in
accordance
with
this
declaration
the
body
was
within
hours
removed
to
chester
and
buried
there
skelton
attending
on
behalf
of
sir
wynston
numerous
and
afflicted
friends
and
relatives
there
are
certain
heartaches
for
which
time
brings
no
healing
nay
which
grow
but
the
sorer
and
fiercer
as
days
and
years
roll
on
of
this
kind
perhaps
were
the
stern
and
bitter
feelings
which
now
darkened
the
face
of
marston
with
an
almost
perpetual
gloom
his
habits
became
even
more
unsocial
than
before
the
society
of
his
son
he
no
longer
seemed
to
enjoy
long
and
solitary
rambles
in
his
wild
and
extensive
demesne
consumed
the
listless
hours
or
his
waking
existence
and
when
the
weather
prevented
this
he
shut
himself
up
upon
pretence
of
business
in
his
study
he
had
not
since
the
occasion
we
have
already
mentioned
referred
to
the
intended
departure
of
mademoiselle
de
barras
truth
to
say
his
feelings
with
respect
to
that
young
lady
were
of
a
conflicting
and
mysterious
kind
and
as
often
as
his
dark
thoughts
wandered
to
her
which
indeed
was
frequently
enough
his
muttered
exclamation
seemed
to
imply
some
painful
and
horrible
suspicions
respecting
her
yes
he
would
mutter
i
thought
i
heard
your
light
foot
upon
the
lobby
on
that
accursed
night
fancy
well
it
may
have
been
but
assuredly
a
strange
fancy
i
can
not
comprehend
that
woman
she
baffles
my
scrutiny
i
have
looked
into
her
face
with
an
eye
she
might
well
understand
were
it
indeed
as
i
sometimes
suspect
and
she
has
been
calm
and
unmoved
i
have
watched
and
studied
her
still
doubt
doubt
hideous
doubt
is
she
what
she
seems
or
a
tigress
marston
on
the
other
hand
procrastinated
from
day
to
day
the
painful
task
of
announcing
to
mademoiselle
de
barras
the
stern
message
with
which
she
had
been
charged
by
her
husband
and
thus
several
weeks
had
passed
and
she
began
to
think
that
his
silence
upon
the
subject
notwithstanding
his
seeing
the
young
french
lady
at
breakfast
every
morning
amounted
to
a
kind
of
tacit
intimation
that
the
sentence
of
banishment
was
not
to
be
carried
into
immediate
execution
but
to
be
kept
suspended
over
the
unconscious
offender
it
was
now
six
or
eight
weeks
since
the
hearse
carrying
away
the
remains
of
the
sir
wynston
berkley
had
driven
down
the
dusky
avenue
the
autumn
was
deepening
into
winter
and
as
marston
gloomily
trod
the
woods
of
gray
forest
the
withered
leaves
whirled
drearily
along
his
pathway
and
the
gusts
that
swayed
the
mighty
branches
above
him
were
rude
and
ungenial
it
was
a
bleak
and
somber
day
and
as
he
broke
into
a
long
and
picturesque
vista
deep
among
the
most
sequestered
woods
he
suddenly
saw
before
him
and
scarcely
twenty
paces
from
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
an
apparition
which
for
some
moments
absolutely
froze
him
to
the
earth
tattered
pale
and
wasted
john
merton
the
murderer
stood
before
him
he
did
not
exhibit
the
smallest
disposition
to
turn
about
and
make
his
escape
on
the
contrary
he
remained
perfectly
motionless
looking
upon
his
former
master
with
a
wild
and
sorrowful
gaze
marston
twice
or
thrice
essayed
to
speak
his
face
was
white
as
death
and
had
he
beheld
the
specter
of
the
murdered
baronet
himself
he
could
not
have
met
the
sight
with
a
countenance
of
ghastlier
horror
take
me
sir
said
merton
doggedly
still
marston
did
not
stir
arrest
me
sir
in
god
name
here
i
am
he
repeated
dropping
his
arms
by
his
side
i
go
with
you
wherever
you
tell
me
murderer
cried
marston
with
a
sudden
burst
of
furious
horror
murderer
assassin
miscreant
take
that
and
as
he
spoke
he
discharged
one
of
the
pistols
he
always
carried
about
him
full
at
the
wretched
man
the
shot
did
not
take
effect
and
merton
made
no
other
gesture
but
to
clasp
his
hands
together
with
an
agonized
pressure
while
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
shoot
me
shoot
me
he
said
hoarsely
kill
me
like
a
dog
better
for
me
to
be
dead
than
what
i
am
the
report
of
marston
pistol
had
however
reached
another
ear
and
its
ringing
echoes
had
hardly
ceased
to
vibrate
among
the
trees
when
a
stern
shout
was
heard
not
fifty
yards
away
and
breathless
and
amazed
charles
marston
sprang
to
the
place
his
father
looked
from
merton
to
him
and
from
him
again
to
merton
with
a
guilty
and
stupefied
scowl
still
holding
the
smoking
pistol
in
his
hand
what
how
good
god
merton
ejaculated
charles
aye
sir
merton
ready
to
go
to
gaol
or
wherever
you
will
said
the
man
recklessly
a
murderer
a
madman
do
believe
him
muttered
marston
scarce
audibly
with
lips
as
white
as
wax
do
you
surrender
yourself
merton
demanded
the
young
man
sternly
advancing
toward
him
yes
sir
i
desire
nothing
more
god
knows
i
wish
to
die
responded
he
despairingly
and
advancing
slowly
to
meet
charles
come
then
said
young
marston
seizing
him
by
the
collar
come
quietly
to
the
house
guilty
and
unhappy
man
you
are
now
my
prisoner
and
depend
upon
it
i
shall
not
let
you
go
i
do
want
to
go
i
tell
you
sir
i
have
traveled
fifteen
miles
today
to
come
here
and
give
myself
up
to
the
master
accursed
madman
said
marston
unconsciously
gazing
at
the
prisoner
and
then
suddenly
rousing
himself
he
said
well
miscreant
you
wish
to
die
and
by
you
are
in
a
fair
way
to
have
your
wish
so
best
said
the
man
doggedly
i
do
want
to
live
i
wish
i
was
in
my
grave
i
wish
i
was
dead
a
year
ago
some
fifteen
minutes
afterwards
merton
accompanied
by
marston
and
his
son
charles
entered
the
hall
of
the
mansion
which
not
ten
weeks
before
he
had
quitted
under
circumstances
so
guilty
and
terrible
when
they
reached
the
house
merton
seemed
much
agitated
and
wept
bitterly
on
seeing
two
or
three
of
his
former
fellow
servants
who
looked
on
him
in
silence
as
they
passed
with
a
gloomy
and
fearful
curiosity
these
too
were
succeeded
by
others
peeping
and
whispering
and
upon
one
pretence
or
another
crossing
and
the
hall
and
stealing
hurried
glances
at
the
criminal
merton
sate
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
sobbing
and
taking
no
note
of
the
humiliating
scrutiny
of
which
he
was
the
subject
meanwhile
marston
pale
and
agitated
made
out
his
committal
and
having
sworn
in
several
of
his
laborers
and
servants
as
special
constables
dispatched
the
prisoner
in
their
charge
to
the
county
gaol
where
under
lock
and
key
we
leave
him
in
safe
custody
for
the
present
after
this
event
marston
became
excited
and
restless
he
scarcely
ate
or
slept
and
his
health
seemed
now
as
much
scattered
as
his
spirits
had
been
before
one
day
he
glided
into
the
room
in
which
as
we
have
said
it
was
marston
habit
frequently
to
sit
alone
his
wife
was
there
and
as
he
entered
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
doubtful
joy
and
surprise
he
sate
down
near
her
in
silence
and
for
some
time
looked
gloomily
on
the
ground
she
did
not
care
to
question
him
and
anxiously
waited
until
he
should
open
the
conversation
at
length
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looking
full
at
her
asked
abruptly
well
what
about
mademoiselle
marston
was
embarrassed
and
hesitated
i
told
you
what
i
wished
with
respect
to
that
young
lady
some
time
ago
and
commissioned
you
to
acquaint
her
with
my
pleasure
and
yet
i
find
her
still
here
and
apparently
as
much
established
as
ever
again
marston
hesitated
she
scarcely
knew
how
to
confess
to
him
that
she
had
not
conveyed
his
message
do
suppose
gertrude
that
i
wish
to
find
fault
i
merely
wanted
to
know
whether
you
had
told
mademoiselle
de
barras
that
we
were
agreed
as
to
the
necessity
or
expediency
or
what
you
please
of
dispensing
henceforward
with
her
services
i
perceive
by
your
manner
that
you
have
not
done
so
i
have
no
doubt
your
motive
was
a
kind
one
but
my
decision
remains
unaltered
and
i
now
assure
you
again
that
i
wish
you
to
speak
to
her
i
wish
you
explicitly
to
let
her
know
my
wishes
and
yours
not
mine
richard
she
answered
faintly
well
mine
then
he
replied
roughly
we
sha
quarrel
about
that
and
when
how
soon
do
you
wish
me
to
speak
to
her
on
this
to
both
of
us
most
painful
subject
asked
she
with
a
sigh
today
this
hour
this
minute
if
you
can
in
short
the
sooner
the
better
he
replied
rising
i
see
no
reason
for
holding
it
back
any
longer
i
am
sorry
my
wishes
were
not
complied
with
immediately
pray
let
there
be
no
further
hesitation
or
delay
i
shall
expect
to
learn
this
evening
that
all
is
arranged
marston
having
thus
spoken
left
her
abruptly
went
down
to
his
study
with
a
swift
step
shut
himself
in
and
throwing
himself
into
a
great
chair
gave
a
loose
to
his
agitation
which
was
extreme
meanwhile
marston
had
sent
for
mademoiselle
de
barras
anxious
to
get
through
her
painful
task
as
speedily
as
possible
the
fair
french
girl
quickly
presented
herself
sit
down
mademoiselle
said
marston
taking
her
hand
kindly
and
drawing
her
to
the
chair
beside
herself
mademoiselle
de
barras
sate
down
and
as
she
did
so
read
the
countenance
of
her
patroness
with
one
rapid
glance
of
her
flashing
eyes
these
eyes
however
when
marston
looked
at
her
the
next
moment
were
sunk
softly
and
sadly
upon
the
floor
there
was
a
heightened
color
however
in
her
cheek
and
a
quicker
heaving
of
her
bosom
which
indicated
the
excitement
of
an
anticipated
and
painful
disclosure
the
outward
contrast
of
the
two
women
whose
hands
were
so
lovingly
locked
together
was
almost
as
striking
as
the
moral
contrast
of
their
hearts
the
one
so
chastened
sad
and
gentle
the
other
so
capable
of
pride
and
passion
so
darkly
excitable
and
yet
so
mysteriously
beautiful
the
one
like
a
niobe
seen
in
the
softest
moonshine
the
other
a
venus
lighted
in
the
glare
of
distant
conflagration
mademoiselle
dear
mademoiselle
i
am
so
much
grieved
at
what
i
have
to
say
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
speak
to
you
said
poor
marston
pressing
her
hand
but
marston
has
twice
desired
me
to
tell
you
what
you
will
hear
with
far
less
pain
than
it
costs
me
to
say
it
mademoiselle
de
barras
stole
another
flashing
glance
at
her
companion
but
did
not
speak
marston
still
persists
mademoiselle
in
desiring
that
we
shall
part
possible
cried
the
frenchwoman
with
a
genuine
start
indeed
mademoiselle
you
may
well
be
surprised
said
marston
encountering
her
full
and
dilated
gaze
which
however
dropped
again
in
a
moment
to
the
ground
you
may
indeed
naturally
be
surprised
and
shocked
at
this
to
me
most
severe
decision
when
did
he
speak
last
of
it
said
she
rapidly
but
a
few
moments
since
answered
marston
ha
said
mademoiselle
and
remained
silent
and
motionless
for
more
than
a
minute
madame
she
cried
at
last
mournfully
i
suppose
then
i
must
go
but
it
tears
my
heart
to
leave
you
and
dear
miss
rhoda
i
would
be
very
happy
if
before
departing
you
would
permit
me
dear
madame
once
more
to
assure
marston
of
my
innocence
and
in
his
presence
to
call
heaven
to
witness
how
unjust
are
all
his
suspicions
do
so
mademoiselle
and
i
will
add
my
earnest
assurances
again
though
heaven
knows
she
said
despondingly
i
anticipate
little
success
but
it
is
well
to
leave
no
chance
untried
marston
was
sitting
as
we
have
said
in
his
library
his
agitation
had
given
place
to
a
listless
gloom
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
head
supported
by
his
hand
and
undisturbed
except
by
the
occasional
fall
of
the
embers
upon
the
hearth
there
was
a
knock
at
the
chamber
door
his
back
was
towards
it
and
without
turning
or
moving
he
called
to
the
applicant
to
enter
the
door
opened
closed
again
a
light
tread
was
audible
a
tall
shadow
darkened
the
wall
marston
looked
round
and
mademoiselle
de
barras
was
standing
before
him
without
knowing
how
or
why
he
rose
and
stood
gazing
upon
her
in
silence
mademoiselle
de
barras
he
said
at
last
in
a
tone
of
cold
surprise
yes
poor
mademoiselle
de
barras
replied
the
sweet
voice
of
the
young
frenchwoman
while
her
lips
hardly
moved
as
the
melancholy
tones
passed
them
well
mademoiselle
what
do
you
desire
he
asked
in
the
same
cold
accents
and
averting
his
eyes
ah
monsieur
do
you
ask
can
you
pretend
to
be
ignorant
have
you
not
sent
me
a
message
a
cruel
cruel
message
she
spoke
so
low
and
gently
that
a
person
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
could
hardly
have
heard
her
words
yes
mademoiselle
de
barras
i
did
send
you
a
message
he
replied
doggedly
a
cruel
one
you
will
scarcely
presume
to
call
it
when
you
reflect
upon
your
own
conduct
and
the
circumstances
which
have
provoked
the
measures
i
have
taken
what
have
i
done
monsieur
what
circumstances
do
you
mean
asked
she
plaintively
what
have
you
done
a
pretty
question
truly
ha
ha
he
repeated
bitterly
and
then
added
with
suppressed
vehemence
ask
your
own
heart
mademoiselle
i
have
asked
i
do
ask
and
my
heart
answers
nothing
she
replied
raising
her
fine
melancholy
eyes
for
a
moment
to
his
face
it
lies
then
he
retorted
with
a
fierce
scoff
monsieur
before
heaven
i
swear
you
wrong
me
foully
she
said
earnestly
clasping
her
hands
together
did
ever
woman
say
she
was
accused
rightly
mademoiselle
retorted
marston
with
a
sneer
i
do
know
i
do
care
i
only
know
that
i
am
innocent
continued
she
piteously
i
call
heaven
to
witness
you
have
wronged
me
wronged
you
why
after
all
with
what
have
i
charged
you
said
he
scoffingly
but
let
that
pass
i
have
formed
my
opinions
arrived
at
my
conclusions
if
i
have
not
named
them
broadly
you
at
least
seem
to
understand
their
nature
thoroughly
i
know
the
world
i
am
no
novice
in
the
arts
of
women
mademoiselle
reserve
your
vows
and
attestations
for
schoolboys
and
simpletons
they
are
sadly
thrown
away
upon
me
marston
paced
to
and
fro
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
as
he
thus
spoke
then
you
do
or
rather
you
will
not
believe
what
i
tell
you
said
she
imploringly
no
he
answered
drily
and
slowly
as
he
passed
her
i
do
and
i
wo
as
you
say
believe
one
word
of
it
so
pray
spare
yourself
further
trouble
about
the
matter
she
raised
her
head
and
darted
after
him
a
glance
that
seemed
absolutely
to
blaze
and
at
the
same
time
smote
her
little
hand
fast
clenched
upon
her
breast
the
words
however
that
trembled
on
her
pale
lips
were
not
uttered
her
eyes
were
again
cast
down
and
her
fingers
played
with
the
little
locket
that
hung
round
her
neck
i
must
make
before
i
go
she
said
with
a
deep
sigh
and
a
melancholy
voice
one
confidence
one
last
confidence
judge
me
by
it
you
can
not
choose
but
believe
me
now
it
is
a
secret
and
it
must
even
here
be
whispered
whispered
whispered
as
she
spoke
the
color
fled
from
her
face
and
her
tones
became
so
strange
and
resolute
that
marston
turned
short
upon
his
heel
and
stopped
before
her
she
looked
in
his
face
he
frowned
but
lowered
his
eyes
she
drew
nearer
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
whispered
for
a
few
moments
in
his
ear
he
raised
his
face
suddenly
its
features
were
sharp
and
fixed
its
hue
was
changed
it
was
livid
and
moveless
like
a
face
cut
in
gray
stone
he
staggered
back
a
little
and
a
little
more
and
then
a
little
more
and
fell
backward
fortunately
the
chair
in
which
he
had
been
sitting
received
him
and
he
lay
there
insensible
as
a
corpse
when
at
last
his
eyes
opened
there
was
no
gleam
of
triumph
no
shade
of
anger
nothing
perceptible
of
guilt
or
menace
in
the
young
countenance
the
flush
had
returned
to
her
cheeks
her
dimpled
chin
had
sunk
upon
her
full
white
throat
sorrow
shame
and
pride
seemed
struggling
in
her
handsome
face
and
she
stood
before
him
like
a
beautiful
penitent
who
has
just
made
a
strange
and
humbling
shrift
to
her
father
confessor
next
day
marston
was
mounting
his
horse
for
a
solitary
ride
through
his
park
when
doctor
danvers
rode
abruptly
into
the
courtyard
from
the
back
entrance
marston
touched
his
hat
and
said
i
do
stand
on
forms
with
you
doctor
and
you
i
know
will
waive
ceremony
with
me
you
will
find
marston
at
home
nay
my
dear
sir
interrupted
the
clergyman
sitting
firm
in
his
saddle
my
business
lies
with
you
today
the
devil
it
does
said
marston
with
discontented
surprise
truly
it
does
sir
repeated
he
with
a
look
of
gentle
reproof
for
the
profanity
of
marston
ejaculation
far
more
than
the
rudeness
of
his
manner
offended
him
and
i
grieve
that
your
surprise
should
have
somewhat
carried
you
away
well
then
doctor
danvers
interrupted
marston
drily
and
without
heeding
his
concluding
remark
if
you
really
have
business
with
me
it
is
at
all
events
of
no
very
pressing
kind
and
may
be
as
well
told
after
supper
as
now
so
pray
go
into
the
house
and
rest
yourself
we
can
talk
together
in
the
evening
my
horse
is
not
tired
said
the
clergyman
patting
his
steed
neck
and
if
you
do
not
object
i
will
ride
by
your
side
for
a
short
time
and
as
we
go
i
can
say
out
what
i
have
to
tell
well
well
be
it
so
said
marston
with
suppressed
impatience
and
without
more
ceremony
he
rode
slowly
along
the
avenue
and
turned
off
upon
the
soft
sward
in
the
direction
of
the
wildest
portion
of
his
wooded
demesne
the
clergyman
keeping
close
beside
him
they
proceeded
some
little
way
at
a
walk
before
doctor
danvers
spoke
i
have
been
twice
or
thrice
with
that
unhappy
man
at
length
he
said
what
unhappy
man
unhappiness
is
no
distinguishing
singularity
is
it
said
marston
sharply
no
truly
you
have
well
said
replied
doctor
danvers
true
it
is
that
man
is
born
unto
trouble
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
i
speak
however
of
your
servant
merton
a
most
unhappy
wretch
ha
you
have
been
with
him
you
say
replied
marston
with
evident
interest
and
anxiety
yes
several
times
and
conversed
with
him
long
and
gravely
continued
the
clergyman
humph
i
thought
that
had
been
the
chaplain
business
not
yours
my
good
friend
observed
marston
he
has
been
unwell
replied
danvers
and
thus
for
a
day
or
two
i
took
his
duty
and
this
poor
man
merton
having
known
something
of
me
preferred
seeing
me
rather
than
a
stranger
and
so
at
the
desire
and
his
i
continued
my
visits
well
and
you
have
taught
him
to
pray
and
sing
psalms
i
suppose
and
what
has
come
of
it
all
demanded
marston
testily
he
does
pray
indeed
poor
man
and
i
trust
his
prayers
are
heard
with
mercy
at
the
throne
of
grace
said
his
companion
in
his
earnestness
disregarding
the
sneering
tone
of
his
companion
he
is
full
of
compunction
and
admits
his
guilt
ho
that
is
well
well
for
himself
well
for
his
soul
at
least
you
are
sure
of
it
he
confesses
confesses
his
guilt
marston
put
his
question
so
rapidly
and
excitedly
that
the
clergyman
looked
with
a
slight
expression
of
surprise
and
recovering
himself
he
added
in
an
unconcerned
tone
well
well
it
was
just
as
well
he
did
so
the
evidence
is
too
clear
for
doubt
or
mystification
he
knew
he
had
no
chance
and
has
taken
the
seemliest
course
and
doubtless
the
best
for
his
hopes
hereafter
i
did
not
question
him
upon
the
subject
said
doctor
danvers
i
even
declined
to
hear
him
speak
upon
it
at
first
but
he
told
me
he
was
resolved
to
offer
no
defense
and
that
he
saw
the
finger
of
god
in
the
fate
which
had
overtaken
him
he
will
plead
guilty
then
i
suppose
suggested
marston
watching
the
countenance
of
his
companion
with
an
anxious
and
somewhat
sinister
eye
his
words
seem
to
imply
so
much
answered
he
and
having
thus
frankly
owned
his
guilt
and
avowed
his
resolution
to
let
the
law
take
its
due
course
in
his
case
without
obstruction
or
evasion
i
urged
him
to
complete
the
grand
work
he
had
begun
and
to
confess
to
you
or
to
some
other
magistrate
fully
and
in
detail
every
circumstance
connected
with
the
perpetration
of
the
dreadful
deed
marston
knit
his
brows
and
rode
on
for
some
minutes
in
silence
at
length
he
said
abruptly
in
this
it
seems
to
me
sir
you
a
little
exceeded
your
commission
how
so
my
dear
sir
asked
the
clergyman
why
sir
answered
marston
the
man
may
possibly
change
his
mind
before
the
day
of
trial
and
it
is
the
hangman
office
not
yours
my
good
sir
to
fasten
the
halter
about
his
neck
you
will
pardon
my
freedom
but
were
this
deposition
made
as
you
suggest
it
would
undoubtedly
hang
him
god
forbid
marston
rejoined
danvers
that
i
should
induce
the
unhappy
man
to
forfeit
his
last
chances
of
escape
and
to
shut
the
door
of
human
mercy
against
himself
but
on
this
he
seems
already
resolved
he
says
so
he
has
solemnly
declared
his
resolution
to
me
and
even
against
my
warning
again
and
again
reiterated
the
same
declaration
that
i
should
have
thought
quite
enough
were
i
in
your
place
without
inviting
a
detailed
description
of
the
whole
process
by
which
this
detestable
butchery
was
consummated
what
more
than
the
simple
knowledge
of
the
man
guilt
does
any
mortal
desire
guilty
or
not
guilty
is
the
plain
question
which
the
law
asks
and
no
more
take
my
advice
sir
as
a
poor
protestant
layman
and
leave
the
acts
of
the
confessional
and
inquisition
to
popish
priests
nay
marston
you
greatly
misconceive
me
as
matters
stand
there
exists
among
the
coroner
jury
and
thus
among
the
public
some
faint
and
unfounded
suspicion
of
the
possibility
of
merton
having
had
an
accessory
or
accomplice
in
the
perpetration
of
this
foul
murder
it
is
a
lie
sir
a
malignant
d
d
lie
the
jury
believe
no
such
thing
nor
the
public
neither
said
marston
starting
in
his
saddle
and
speaking
in
a
voice
of
thunder
you
have
been
crammed
with
lies
sir
malicious
unmeaning
vindictive
lies
lies
invented
to
asperse
my
family
and
torture
my
feelings
suggested
in
my
presence
by
that
scoundrel
mervyn
and
scouted
by
the
common
sense
of
the
jury
i
do
assure
you
replied
doctor
danvers
in
a
voice
which
seemed
scarcely
audible
after
the
stunning
and
passionate
explosion
of
marston
wrath
i
did
not
imagine
that
you
could
feel
thus
sorely
upon
the
point
nay
i
thought
that
you
yourself
were
not
without
such
painful
doubts
again
i
tell
you
sir
said
marston
in
a
tone
somewhat
calmer
but
no
less
stern
such
doubts
as
you
describe
have
no
existence
your
unsuspecting
ear
has
been
alarmed
by
a
vindictive
wretch
an
old
scoundrel
who
has
scarce
a
passion
left
but
spite
towards
me
few
such
there
are
thank
god
few
such
villains
as
would
from
a
man
very
calamities
distil
poison
to
kill
the
peace
and
character
of
his
family
i
am
sorry
marston
said
the
clergyman
you
have
formed
so
ill
an
opinion
of
a
neighbor
and
i
am
very
sure
that
mervyn
meant
you
no
ill
in
frankly
expressing
whatever
doubts
still
rested
on
his
mind
after
the
evidence
was
taken
he
did
the
scoundrel
said
marston
furiously
striking
his
hand
in
which
his
whip
was
clutched
upon
his
thigh
he
did
mean
to
wound
and
torture
me
and
with
the
same
object
he
persists
in
circulating
what
he
calls
his
doubts
meant
me
no
ill
forsooth
why
my
great
god
sir
could
any
man
be
so
stupid
as
not
to
perceive
that
the
suggestion
of
such
suspicions
absurd
contradictory
incredible
as
they
were
was
precisely
the
thing
to
exasperate
feelings
sufficiently
troubled
already
and
not
content
with
raising
the
question
where
it
was
scouted
as
i
said
as
soon
as
named
the
vindictive
slanderer
proceeds
to
propagate
and
publish
his
pretended
surmises
d
n
him
marston
you
will
pardon
me
when
i
say
that
as
a
christian
minister
i
can
not
suffer
a
spirit
so
ill
as
that
you
manifest
and
language
so
unseemly
as
that
you
have
just
uttered
to
pass
unreproved
said
danvers
solemnly
if
you
will
cherish
those
bitter
and
unchristian
feelings
at
least
for
the
brief
space
that
i
am
with
you
command
your
fierce
unbecoming
words
marston
was
about
to
make
a
sneering
retort
but
restrained
himself
and
turned
his
head
away
the
wretched
man
himself
appears
now
very
anxious
to
make
some
further
disclosures
resumed
doctor
danvers
after
a
pause
and
i
recommended
him
to
make
them
to
you
marston
as
the
most
natural
depository
of
such
a
statement
well
danvers
to
cut
the
matter
short
as
it
appears
that
a
confession
of
some
sort
is
to
be
made
be
it
so
i
will
attend
and
receive
it
the
judges
will
not
be
here
for
eight
or
ten
weeks
to
come
so
there
is
no
great
hurry
about
it
i
shall
ride
down
to
the
town
and
see
him
in
the
jail
some
time
in
the
next
week
with
this
assurance
marston
parted
from
the
old
clergyman
and
rode
on
alone
through
the
furze
and
fern
of
his
wild
and
somber
park
after
supper
that
evening
marston
found
himself
alone
in
the
parlor
with
his
wife
marston
availed
herself
of
the
opportunity
to
redeem
her
pledge
to
mademoiselle
de
barras
she
was
not
aware
of
the
strange
interview
which
had
taken
place
between
him
and
the
lady
for
whom
she
pleaded
the
result
of
her
renewed
entreaties
perhaps
the
reader
has
anticipated
marston
listened
doubted
listened
hesitated
again
put
questions
pondered
the
answers
debated
the
matter
inwardly
and
at
last
gruffly
consented
to
give
the
young
lady
another
trial
and
permit
her
to
remain
some
time
longer
poor
marston
little
suspecting
the
dreadful
future
overwhelmed
her
husband
with
gratitude
for
granting
to
her
entreaties
as
he
had
predetermined
to
do
this
fatal
boon
not
caring
to
protract
this
scene
either
from
a
disinclination
to
listen
to
expressions
of
affection
which
had
long
lost
their
charm
for
him
and
had
become
even
positively
distasteful
or
perhaps
from
some
instinctive
recoil
from
the
warm
expression
of
gratitude
from
lips
which
were
the
truth
revealed
might
justly
have
trembled
with
execration
and
reproach
he
abruptly
left
the
room
and
marston
full
of
her
good
news
hastened
in
the
kindness
of
her
heart
to
communicate
the
fancied
result
of
her
advocacy
to
mademoiselle
de
barras
it
was
about
a
week
after
this
that
marston
was
one
evening
surprised
in
his
study
by
the
receipt
of
the
following
letter
from
danvers
my
dear
sir
you
will
be
shocked
to
hear
that
merton
is
most
dangerously
ill
and
at
this
moment
in
imminent
peril
he
is
thoroughly
conscious
of
his
situation
and
himself
regards
it
as
a
merciful
interposition
of
providence
to
spare
him
the
disgrace
and
terror
of
the
dreadful
fate
which
he
anticipated
the
unhappy
man
has
twice
repeated
his
anxious
desire
this
day
to
state
some
facts
connected
with
the
murder
of
the
late
sir
wynston
berkley
which
he
says
it
is
of
the
utmost
moment
that
you
should
hear
he
says
that
he
could
not
leave
the
world
in
peace
without
having
made
this
disclosure
which
he
especially
desires
to
make
to
yourself
and
entreats
that
you
will
come
to
receive
his
communication
as
early
as
you
can
in
the
morning
this
is
indeed
needful
as
the
physician
says
that
he
is
fast
sinking
i
offer
no
apology
for
adding
my
earnest
solicitations
to
those
or
the
dying
man
and
am
dear
sir
your
very
obedient
servant
danvers
he
regards
it
as
a
merciful
interposition
of
providence
muttered
marston
as
he
closed
the
letter
with
a
sneer
well
some
men
have
odd
notions
of
mercy
and
providence
to
be
sure
but
if
it
pleases
him
certainly
i
shall
not
complain
for
one
marston
was
all
this
evening
in
better
spirits
than
he
had
enjoyed
for
months
or
even
years
a
mountain
seemed
to
have
been
lifted
from
his
heart
he
joined
in
the
conversation
during
and
after
supper
listened
with
apparent
interest
talked
with
animation
and
even
laughed
and
jested
it
is
needless
to
say
all
this
flowed
not
from
the
healthy
cheer
of
a
heart
at
ease
but
from
the
excited
and
almost
feverish
sense
of
sudden
relief
next
morning
marston
rode
into
the
town
at
the
further
end
of
which
the
dingy
and
grated
front
of
the
jail
looked
warningly
out
upon
the
rustic
passengers
he
passed
the
sentries
and
made
his
inquiries
of
the
official
at
the
hatch
he
was
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
pushing
these
into
detail
however
by
the
appearance
of
the
physician
who
at
that
moment
passed
from
the
interior
of
the
prison
danvers
told
me
he
expected
to
see
you
here
this
morning
said
the
medical
man
after
the
customary
salutation
had
been
interchanged
your
call
i
believe
is
connected
with
the
prisoner
john
merton
yes
sir
so
it
is
said
marston
is
he
in
a
condition
pray
to
make
a
statement
of
considerable
length
far
from
it
marston
he
has
but
a
few
hours
to
live
answered
the
physician
and
is
now
insensible
but
i
believe
he
last
night
saw
danvers
and
told
him
whatever
was
weighing
upon
his
mind
ha
and
can
you
say
where
danvers
now
is
inquired
marston
anxiously
and
hurriedly
not
here
is
he
no
but
i
saw
him
as
i
came
here
not
ten
minutes
since
ride
into
the
town
it
is
and
you
will
probably
find
him
somewhere
in
the
high
street
for
an
hour
or
two
to
come
answered
he
marston
thanked
him
and
lost
in
abstraction
rode
down
to
the
little
inn
entered
a
sitting
room
and
wrote
a
hurried
line
to
danvers
entreating
his
attendance
there
as
a
place
where
they
might
converse
less
interruptedly
than
in
the
street
and
committing
this
note
to
the
waiter
with
the
injunction
to
deliver
it
at
once
and
an
intimation
of
where
danvers
was
probably
to
be
found
he
awaited
with
intense
and
agitating
anxiety
the
arrival
of
the
clergyman
it
was
not
for
nearly
ten
minutes
however
which
his
impatience
magnified
into
an
eternity
that
the
voice
of
danvers
reached
him
from
the
little
hall
it
was
in
vain
that
marston
strove
to
curb
his
violent
agitation
his
heart
swelled
as
if
it
would
smother
him
he
felt
as
it
were
the
chill
of
death
pervade
his
frame
and
he
could
scarcely
see
the
door
through
which
he
momentarily
expected
the
entrance
of
the
clergyman
a
few
minutes
more
and
danvers
entered
the
little
apartment
my
dear
sir
said
he
gravely
and
earnestly
as
he
grasped
the
cold
hand
of
marston
i
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
i
have
matters
of
great
moment
and
the
strangest
mystery
to
lay
before
you
i
dare
say
i
was
sure
that
is
i
suspected
so
much
answered
marston
breathing
fast
and
looking
very
pale
i
heard
at
the
prison
that
the
murderer
merton
was
fast
dying
and
now
is
in
an
unconscious
state
and
from
the
physician
that
you
had
seen
him
at
his
urgent
entreaty
last
night
my
mind
misgives
me
sir
i
fear
i
know
not
what
i
long
yet
dread
to
hear
the
wretched
man
confession
for
god
sake
tell
me
does
it
implicate
anybody
else
in
the
guilt
no
no
one
specifically
but
it
has
thrown
a
hideous
additional
mystery
over
the
occurrence
listen
to
me
my
dear
sir
and
the
whole
narrative
as
he
stated
it
to
me
shall
be
related
now
to
you
said
danvers
marston
had
closed
the
door
carefully
and
they
sate
down
together
at
the
further
end
of
the
apartment
marston
breathless
and
ghastly
pale
his
lips
compressed
his
brows
knit
and
his
dark
dilated
gaze
fixed
immovably
upon
the
speaker
danvers
on
the
other
hand
tranquil
and
solemn
and
with
perhaps
some
shade
of
awe
overcasting
the
habitual
sweetness
of
his
countenance
his
confession
was
a
strange
one
renewed
danvers
shaking
his
head
gravely
he
said
that
the
first
idea
of
the
crime
was
suggested
by
sir
wynston
man
accidentally
mentioning
a
few
days
after
their
arrival
that
his
master
slept
with
his
to
the
amount
of
some
hundreds
of
pounds
in
a
pocketbook
under
his
pillow
he
declared
that
as
the
man
mentioned
this
circumstance
something
muttered
the
infernal
suggestion
in
his
ear
and
from
that
moment
he
was
the
slave
of
that
one
idea
it
was
ever
present
with
him
he
contended
against
it
in
vain
he
dreaded
and
abhorred
it
but
still
it
possessed
him
he
felt
his
power
of
resistance
yielding
this
horrible
stranger
which
had
stolen
into
his
heart
waxed
in
power
and
importunity
and
tormented
him
day
and
night
he
resolved
to
fly
from
the
house
he
gave
notice
to
you
and
marston
of
his
intended
departure
but
accident
protracted
his
stay
until
that
fatal
night
which
sealed
his
doom
the
influence
which
had
mastered
him
forced
him
to
rise
from
his
bed
and
take
the
knife
the
discovery
of
which
afterwards
helped
to
convict
him
and
led
him
to
sir
chamber
he
entered
it
was
a
moonlight
night
here
the
clergyman
glancing
round
the
room
lowered
his
voice
and
advanced
his
lips
so
near
to
marston
that
their
heads
nearly
touched
in
this
tone
and
attitude
he
continued
his
narrative
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
end
of
this
brief
space
marston
rose
up
slowly
and
with
a
movement
backward
every
feature
strung
with
horror
and
saying
in
a
long
whisper
the
one
word
yes
which
seemed
like
the
hiss
of
a
snake
before
he
makes
his
last
deadly
spring
both
were
silent
for
a
time
at
last
marston
broke
out
with
hoarse
vehemence
dreadful
horrible
oh
god
god
my
god
how
frightful
and
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
he
clasped
his
hands
across
his
eyes
and
forehead
while
the
sweat
of
agony
literally
poured
down
his
pale
face
truly
it
is
so
said
the
clergyman
scarcely
above
his
breath
and
after
a
long
interval
horrible
indeed
well
said
marston
rising
suddenly
to
his
feet
wiping
the
dews
of
horror
from
his
face
and
looking
wildly
round
like
one
newly
awoke
from
a
nightmare
i
must
make
the
most
of
this
momentous
and
startling
disclosure
i
shall
spare
no
pains
to
come
at
the
truth
said
he
energetically
meanwhile
my
dear
sir
for
the
sake
of
justice
and
of
mercy
observe
secrecy
leave
me
to
sift
this
matter
give
no
note
anywhere
that
we
suspect
observe
this
reserve
and
security
and
with
it
detection
will
follow
breathe
but
one
word
and
you
arm
the
guilty
with
double
caution
and
turn
licentious
gossip
loose
upon
the
fame
of
an
innocent
and
troubled
family
once
more
i
entreat
i
expect
i
implore
silence
silence
at
least
for
the
present
silence
i
quite
agree
with
you
my
dear
marston
answered
danvers
i
have
not
divulged
one
syllable
of
that
poor
wretch
confession
save
to
yourself
alone
you
as
a
magistrate
a
relative
of
the
murdered
gentleman
and
the
head
of
that
establishment
among
whom
the
guilt
rests
are
invested
with
an
interest
in
detecting
and
powers
of
sifting
the
truth
in
this
matter
such
as
none
other
possesses
i
clearly
see
with
you
too
the
inexpediency
and
folly
of
talking
for
sake
of
this
affair
i
mean
to
keep
my
counsel
and
shall
most
assuredly
irrespectively
even
of
your
request
which
should
however
of
course
have
weight
with
me
maintain
a
strict
and
cautious
silence
upon
this
subject
some
little
time
longer
they
remained
together
and
marston
buried
in
strange
thoughts
took
his
leave
and
rode
slowly
back
to
gray
forest
months
passed
away
a
year
and
more
and
though
no
new
character
appeared
upon
the
stage
the
relations
which
had
subsisted
among
the
old
ones
became
in
some
respects
very
materially
altered
a
gradual
and
disagreeable
change
came
over
mademoiselle
de
barras
manner
her
affectionate
attentions
to
marston
became
less
and
less
frequent
nor
was
the
change
merely
confined
to
this
growing
coldness
there
was
something
of
a
positive
and
still
more
unpleasant
kind
in
the
alteration
we
have
noted
there
was
a
certain
independence
and
carelessness
conveyed
in
a
hundred
intangible
but
significant
little
incidents
and
looks
a
something
which
without
being
open
to
formal
rebuke
or
remonstrance
yet
bordered
in
effect
upon
impertinence
and
even
insolence
this
indescribable
and
provoking
implied
in
glances
tones
emphasis
and
general
bearing
surprised
marston
far
more
than
it
irritated
her
as
often
as
she
experienced
one
of
these
studied
slights
or
insinuated
impertinences
she
revolved
in
her
own
mind
all
the
incidents
of
their
past
intercourse
in
the
vain
endeavor
to
recollect
some
one
among
them
which
could
possibly
account
for
the
offensive
change
so
manifest
in
the
conduct
of
the
young
frenchwoman
marston
although
she
sometimes
rebuked
these
artful
affronts
by
a
grave
look
a
cold
tone
or
a
distant
manner
yet
had
too
much
dignity
to
engage
in
a
petty
warfare
of
annoyance
and
had
in
reality
no
substantial
and
ground
of
complaint
against
her
such
as
would
have
warranted
her
either
in
taking
the
young
lady
herself
to
task
or
in
bringing
her
conduct
under
the
censure
of
marston
one
evening
it
happened
that
marston
and
mademoiselle
de
barras
had
been
left
alone
together
after
the
had
dispersed
they
had
been
for
a
long
time
silent
marston
resolved
to
improve
the
for
the
purpose
of
eliciting
from
mademoiselle
an
explanation
of
her
strange
behavior
mademoiselle
said
she
i
have
lately
observed
a
very
marked
change
in
your
conduct
to
me
indeed
said
the
frenchwoman
yes
mademoiselle
you
must
be
yourself
perfectly
aware
of
that
change
it
is
a
studied
and
intentional
one
continued
marston
in
a
gentle
but
dignified
tone
although
i
have
felt
some
doubt
as
to
whether
it
were
advisable
so
long
as
you
observe
toward
me
the
forms
of
external
respect
and
punctually
discharge
the
duties
you
have
undertaken
to
open
any
discussion
whatever
upon
the
subject
yet
i
have
thought
it
better
to
give
you
a
fair
opportunity
of
explaining
frankly
should
you
desire
to
do
so
the
feelings
and
impressions
under
which
you
are
acting
ah
you
are
very
obliging
madame
said
she
coolly
it
is
quite
clear
mademoiselle
that
you
have
either
misunderstood
me
or
that
you
are
dissatisfied
with
your
situation
among
us
your
conduct
can
not
otherwise
be
accounted
for
said
marston
gravely
my
conduct
foi
what
conduct
retorted
the
handsome
frenchwoman
confidently
and
with
a
disdainful
glance
if
you
question
the
fact
mademoiselle
said
the
elder
lady
it
is
enough
your
ungracious
manner
and
ungentle
looks
i
presume
arise
from
what
appears
to
you
a
sufficient
and
cause
of
which
however
i
know
nothing
i
really
was
not
aware
said
mademoiselle
de
barras
with
a
supercilious
smile
that
my
looks
and
my
manner
were
subjected
to
so
strict
a
criticism
or
that
it
was
my
duty
to
regulate
both
according
to
so
nice
and
difficult
a
standard
well
mademoiselle
continued
marston
it
is
plain
that
whatever
may
be
the
cause
of
your
dissatisfaction
you
are
resolved
against
confiding
it
to
me
i
only
wish
to
know
frankly
from
your
own
lips
whether
you
have
formed
a
wish
to
leave
this
situation
if
so
i
entreat
you
to
declare
it
freely
you
are
very
obliging
indeed
madame
said
the
pretty
foreigner
drily
but
i
have
no
such
wish
at
least
at
present
very
well
mademoiselle
replied
marston
with
gentle
dignity
i
regret
your
want
of
candor
on
your
own
account
you
would
i
am
sure
be
much
happier
were
you
to
deal
frankly
with
me
may
i
now
have
your
permission
madame
to
retire
to
my
room
asked
the
french
girl
rising
and
making
a
low
courtesy
that
is
if
madame
has
nothing
further
to
censure
certainly
mademoiselle
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
replied
the
elder
lady
the
frenchwoman
made
another
and
a
deeper
courtesy
and
withdrew
marston
however
heard
as
she
was
designed
to
do
the
young
lady
tittering
and
whispering
to
herself
as
she
lighted
her
candle
in
the
hall
this
scene
mortified
and
grieved
poor
marston
inexpressibly
she
was
little
if
at
all
accessible
to
emotions
of
anger
and
certainly
none
such
mingled
in
the
feelings
with
which
she
regarded
mademoiselle
de
barras
but
she
had
found
in
this
girl
a
companion
and
even
a
confidante
in
her
melancholy
solitude
she
had
believed
her
affectionate
sympathetic
tender
and
the
disappointment
was
as
bitter
as
unimagined
the
annoyances
which
she
was
fated
to
receive
from
mademoiselle
de
barras
were
destined
however
to
grow
in
number
and
in
magnitude
the
frenchwoman
sometimes
took
a
fancy
for
some
unrevealed
purpose
to
talk
a
good
deal
to
marston
and
on
such
occasions
would
persist
notwithstanding
that
lady
marked
reserve
and
discouragement
in
chatting
away
as
if
she
were
conscious
that
her
conversation
was
the
most
welcome
entertainment
possible
to
her
really
unwilling
auditor
no
one
of
their
interviews
did
she
ever
suffer
to
close
without
in
some
way
or
other
suggesting
or
insinuating
something
mysterious
and
untold
to
the
prejudice
of
marston
those
vague
and
intangible
hints
the
meaning
of
which
for
an
instant
legible
and
terrific
seemed
in
another
moment
to
dissolve
and
disappear
tortured
marston
like
the
intrusion
of
a
specter
and
this
along
with
the
portentous
change
rather
felt
than
visible
in
mademoiselle
conduct
toward
her
invested
the
beautiful
frenchwoman
in
the
eyes
of
her
former
friend
and
patroness
with
an
indefinable
character
that
was
not
only
repulsive
but
formidable
marston
feelings
with
respect
to
this
person
were
still
further
disturbed
by
the
hints
and
innuendoes
of
her
own
maid
who
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
insinuating
her
intense
dislike
of
the
frenchwoman
and
appeared
perpetually
to
be
upon
the
very
verge
of
making
some
explicit
charges
or
some
shocking
revelations
respecting
her
which
however
she
as
invariably
evaded
and
even
when
marston
once
or
twice
insisted
upon
her
explaining
her
meaning
distinctly
she
eluded
her
mistress
desire
and
left
her
still
in
the
same
uneasy
uncertainty
marston
on
his
part
however
much
his
conduct
might
tend
to
confirm
suspicion
certainly
did
nothing
to
dissipate
the
painful
and
undefined
apprehension
respecting
himself
which
mademoiselle
de
barras
with
such
malign
and
mysterious
industry
labored
to
raise
his
spirits
and
temper
were
liable
to
strange
fluctuations
in
the
midst
of
that
excited
gaiety
to
which
until
lately
he
had
been
so
long
a
stranger
would
sometimes
intervene
paroxysms
of
the
blackest
despair
all
the
ghastlier
for
the
contrast
and
with
a
suddenness
so
abrupt
and
overwhelming
that
one
might
have
fancied
him
crossed
by
the
shadow
of
some
terrific
apparition
sometimes
for
a
whole
day
or
even
more
he
would
withdraw
himself
from
the
society
of
his
family
and
in
morose
and
moody
solitude
take
his
meals
alone
in
his
library
and
steal
out
unattended
to
wander
among
the
thickets
and
glades
of
his
park
sometimes
again
he
would
sit
for
hours
in
the
room
which
had
been
sir
wynston
and
with
a
kind
of
horrible
resolution
often
loiter
there
till
after
nightfall
in
such
hours
the
servants
would
listen
with
curious
awe
as
they
heard
his
step
pacing
to
and
fro
in
that
deserted
and
inauspicious
chamber
while
his
voice
in
broken
sentences
was
also
imperfectly
audible
as
if
maintaining
a
muttered
dialogue
these
eccentric
practices
gradually
invested
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
domestics
with
a
certain
preternatural
mystery
which
enhanced
the
fear
with
which
they
habitually
regarded
him
and
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
his
giving
orders
to
have
the
furniture
taken
out
of
the
ominous
suite
of
rooms
and
the
doors
nailed
up
and
secured
he
gave
no
reason
for
this
odd
and
abrupt
measure
and
gossip
of
course
reported
that
the
direction
had
originated
in
his
having
encountered
the
specter
of
the
murdered
baronet
in
one
of
these
strange
and
unseasonable
visits
to
the
scene
of
the
fearful
catastrophe
in
addition
to
all
this
marston
conduct
towards
his
wife
became
strangely
capricious
he
avoided
her
society
more
than
ever
and
when
he
did
happen
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
her
they
were
sometimes
harsh
and
violent
and
at
others
remorsefully
gentle
and
sad
and
this
without
any
changes
of
conduct
upon
her
part
to
warrant
the
wayward
uncertainty
of
his
treatment
under
all
these
circumstances
unhappiness
and
uneasiness
greatly
increased
mademoiselle
de
barras
too
upon
several
late
occasions
had
begun
to
assume
a
tone
of
authority
and
dictation
which
justly
offended
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
meanwhile
charles
marston
had
returned
to
cambridge
and
rhoda
no
longer
enjoying
happy
walks
with
her
brother
pursued
her
light
and
easy
studies
with
mademoiselle
de
barras
and
devoted
her
leisure
hours
to
the
loved
society
of
her
mother
one
day
marston
sitting
in
her
room
with
rhoda
had
happened
to
call
her
own
maid
to
take
down
and
carefully
dust
some
richly
bound
volumes
which
filled
a
bookcase
in
the
little
chamber
you
have
been
crying
willett
said
marston
observing
that
the
young
woman
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
indeed
and
i
was
she
replied
reluctantly
and
i
could
not
help
it
so
i
could
not
why
what
has
happened
to
vex
you
has
anyone
you
said
marston
who
had
an
esteem
for
the
poor
girl
come
come
you
must
not
fret
about
it
only
tell
me
what
has
vexed
you
oh
no
one
has
me
but
i
ca
but
be
vexed
sometimes
and
fretted
to
see
how
things
is
going
on
i
have
one
wish
just
one
wish
and
if
i
got
that
i
ask
no
more
said
the
girl
and
what
is
it
asked
marston
what
do
you
wish
for
speak
plainly
willett
what
is
it
ah
if
i
said
it
maybe
you
might
not
be
pleased
do
ask
me
said
the
girl
dusting
the
books
very
hard
and
tossing
them
down
again
with
angry
emphasis
i
do
desire
anybody
harm
god
knows
but
for
all
that
i
wish
what
i
wish
and
that
is
the
truth
why
willett
i
really
can
not
account
for
your
strange
habit
of
lately
hinting
and
insinuating
and
always
speaking
riddles
and
refusing
to
explain
your
meaning
what
do
you
mean
speak
plainly
if
there
are
any
dishonest
practices
going
on
it
is
your
duty
to
say
so
distinctly
oh
it
is
just
a
wish
i
have
i
wish
but
it
no
matter
if
i
could
once
see
the
house
clear
of
that
frenchwoman
if
you
mean
mademoiselle
de
barras
she
is
a
lady
interrupted
marston
well
i
beg
pardon
continued
the
woman
lady
or
no
lady
it
is
all
one
to
me
for
i
am
very
sure
she
never
leave
the
house
till
there
is
something
bad
comes
about
and
and
i
ca
bring
myself
to
talk
to
you
about
her
i
ca
say
what
i
want
to
tell
you
but
but
oh
for
god
sake
try
and
get
her
out
any
way
no
matter
how
try
and
get
rid
of
her
as
she
said
this
the
poor
girl
burst
into
a
passionate
agony
of
tears
and
marston
and
rhoda
looked
on
in
silent
amazement
while
she
for
some
minutes
continued
to
sob
and
weep
the
party
were
suddenly
recalled
from
their
various
reveries
by
a
knock
at
the
it
opened
and
the
subject
of
the
girl
deprecatory
entreaty
entered
there
was
something
unusually
excited
and
assured
in
mademoiselle
de
barras
air
and
countenance
perhaps
she
had
a
suspicion
that
she
had
been
the
topic
of
their
conversation
at
all
events
she
looked
round
upon
them
with
a
smile
in
which
there
was
something
supercilious
and
even
defiant
and
without
waiting
to
be
invited
sate
herself
down
with
a
haughty
air
i
was
about
to
ask
you
to
sit
down
mademoiselle
but
you
have
anticipated
me
said
marston
gravely
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
i
suppose
i
am
quite
at
leisure
so
pray
let
me
hear
it
now
thank
you
thank
you
madame
replied
she
with
a
sharp
and
even
scornful
glance
i
ought
to
have
asked
your
permission
to
sit
i
forgot
but
you
have
condescended
to
give
it
without
my
doing
so
that
was
very
kind
very
kind
indeed
but
i
wish
to
know
mademoiselle
whether
you
have
anything
very
particular
to
say
to
me
said
marston
you
wish
to
know
and
why
pray
madame
asked
mademoiselle
de
barras
sharply
because
unless
it
is
something
very
urgent
i
should
prefer
your
talking
to
me
some
other
time
as
at
present
i
desire
to
be
alone
with
my
daughter
oh
ho
i
ought
to
ask
pardon
again
said
mademoiselle
with
the
same
glance
and
the
same
smile
i
find
i
am
de
trop
quite
in
the
way
hélas
i
am
very
unfortunate
today
mademoiselle
de
barras
made
not
the
slightest
movement
and
it
was
evident
that
she
was
resolved
to
prolong
her
stay
in
sheer
defiance
of
marston
wishes
mademoiselle
i
conclude
from
your
silence
that
you
have
nothing
very
pressing
to
say
and
therefore
must
request
that
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
leave
me
for
the
present
said
marston
who
felt
that
the
spirit
of
the
french
girl
conduct
was
too
apparent
not
to
have
been
understood
by
rhoda
and
the
servant
and
that
it
was
of
a
kind
for
example
sake
impossible
to
be
submitted
to
or
tolerated
mademoiselle
de
barras
darted
a
fiery
and
insolent
glance
at
marston
and
was
doubtless
upon
the
point
of
precipitating
the
open
quarrel
which
was
impending
by
setting
her
authority
at
defiance
but
she
checked
herself
and
changed
her
line
of
operations
we
are
not
alone
madame
she
said
with
a
heightened
color
and
a
slight
toss
of
the
head
i
was
about
to
speak
of
marston
i
had
something
not
much
i
confess
to
say
but
before
servants
i
speak
nor
indeed
now
at
all
so
madame
as
you
desire
it
i
shall
no
further
interrupt
you
come
miss
rhoda
come
to
the
if
you
please
and
finish
your
practice
for
today
you
forget
mademoiselle
that
i
wish
to
have
my
daughter
with
me
at
present
said
marston
i
am
very
sorry
madame
said
the
french
lady
with
the
same
heightened
color
and
unpleasant
smile
and
her
brows
just
discernibly
knit
so
as
to
give
a
novel
and
menacing
expression
to
her
beautiful
face
i
am
very
sorry
madame
but
she
must
so
long
as
i
remain
accountable
for
her
education
complete
her
allotted
exercises
at
the
appointed
hours
and
nothing
shall
i
assure
you
with
my
consent
interfere
with
these
duties
come
miss
rhoda
precede
me
if
you
please
to
the
come
come
stay
where
you
are
rhoda
said
marston
firmly
and
gently
and
betraying
no
symptom
of
excitement
except
in
a
slight
tremor
of
her
voice
and
a
faint
flush
upon
her
cheek
stay
where
you
are
my
dear
child
i
am
your
mother
and
next
to
your
father
have
the
first
claim
upon
your
obedience
mademoiselle
she
continued
addressing
the
frenchwoman
calmly
but
firmly
my
daughter
will
remain
here
for
some
time
longer
and
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
withdraw
i
insist
upon
it
mademoiselle
de
barras
i
will
not
leave
the
room
i
assure
you
madame
without
my
pupil
retorted
mademoiselle
with
resolute
insolence
your
husband
madame
has
invested
me
with
this
authority
and
she
shall
obey
me
miss
rhoda
i
say
again
go
down
to
the
remain
where
you
are
rhoda
said
marston
again
mademoiselle
you
have
long
been
acting
as
if
your
object
were
to
provoke
me
to
part
with
you
i
find
it
impossible
any
longer
to
overlook
this
grossly
disrespectful
conduct
conduct
of
which
i
had
indeed
believed
you
absolutely
incapable
willett
she
continued
addressing
the
maid
who
was
evidently
bursting
with
rage
at
the
scene
she
had
just
witnessed
your
master
is
i
believe
in
the
library
go
down
and
tell
him
that
i
entreat
him
to
come
here
immediately
the
maid
started
on
her
mission
with
angry
alacrity
darting
a
venomous
glance
at
the
handsome
frenchwoman
as
she
passed
mademoiselle
de
barras
meanwhile
sate
listless
and
defiant
in
her
chair
and
tapping
her
little
foot
with
angry
excitement
upon
the
floor
rhoda
sate
close
by
her
mother
holding
her
hand
fast
and
looking
frightened
perplexed
and
as
if
she
were
on
the
point
of
weeping
marston
though
flushed
and
excited
yet
maintained
her
dignified
and
grave
demeanor
and
thus
in
silence
did
they
all
three
await
the
arrival
of
the
arbiter
to
whom
marston
had
so
promptly
appealed
a
few
minutes
more
and
marston
entered
the
room
expression
changed
as
he
did
so
to
one
of
dejected
and
sorrowful
submission
and
as
marston
eye
lighted
upon
her
his
brow
darkened
and
his
face
grew
pale
well
well
what
is
it
what
is
all
this
he
said
glancing
with
a
troubled
eye
from
one
to
the
other
speak
someone
marston
you
sent
for
me
what
is
it
i
want
to
know
marston
from
your
own
lips
said
the
lady
in
reply
whether
rhoda
is
to
obey
me
or
mademoiselle
de
barras
bah
a
question
of
women
prerogative
said
marston
with
muttered
vehemence
of
a
wife
and
a
mother
prerogative
richard
said
marston
with
gentle
emphasis
a
very
simple
question
and
one
i
should
have
thought
needing
no
deliberation
to
decide
it
well
child
sad
he
turning
to
rhoda
with
angry
irony
pray
what
is
all
this
fuss
about
you
are
a
very
ill
used
young
lady
i
dare
aver
pray
what
cruelties
does
mademoiselle
de
barras
propose
inflicting
upon
you
that
you
need
to
appeal
thus
to
your
mother
for
protection
you
quite
mistake
me
richard
interposed
marston
rhoda
is
perfectly
passive
in
the
matter
i
simply
wish
to
learn
from
you
in
mademoiselle
presence
whether
i
or
she
is
to
command
my
daughter
command
said
marston
evading
the
direct
appeal
and
pray
what
is
all
this
commanding
about
what
do
you
want
the
girl
to
do
i
wish
her
to
remain
here
with
me
for
a
little
time
and
mademoiselle
knowing
this
desires
her
instantly
to
go
to
the
and
leave
me
that
is
all
said
marston
and
pray
is
there
nothing
to
make
her
going
to
the
advisable
or
necessary
has
she
no
music
to
learn
or
studies
to
pursue
pshaw
marston
what
needs
all
this
noise
about
nothing
go
miss
he
added
sharply
and
peremptorily
addressing
rhoda
go
this
moment
to
the
the
girl
glided
from
the
room
and
mademoiselle
as
she
followed
shot
a
glance
at
marston
which
wounded
and
humbled
her
in
the
dust
oh
richard
richard
if
you
knew
all
you
would
not
have
subjected
me
to
this
indignity
she
said
and
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
wept
for
the
first
time
for
many
a
long
year
upon
his
breast
marston
was
embarrassed
and
agitated
he
disengaged
her
arms
from
his
neck
and
placed
her
gently
in
a
chair
she
sobbed
on
for
some
time
in
silence
a
silence
which
marston
himself
did
not
essay
to
break
he
walked
to
the
door
apparently
with
the
intention
of
leaving
her
he
hesitated
however
and
returned
took
a
hurried
turn
through
the
room
hesitated
again
sat
down
then
returned
to
the
door
not
to
depart
but
to
close
it
carefully
and
walked
gloomily
to
the
window
whence
he
looked
forth
buried
in
agitating
and
absorbing
thoughts
richard
to
you
this
seems
a
trifling
thing
but
indeed
it
is
not
so
said
marston
sadly
you
are
very
right
gertrude
he
said
quickly
and
almost
with
a
start
it
is
very
far
from
a
trifling
thing
it
is
very
important
you
do
blame
me
richard
said
she
i
blame
nobody
said
he
indeed
i
never
meant
to
offend
you
richard
she
urged
of
course
not
no
no
i
never
said
so
he
interrupted
sarcastically
what
could
you
gain
by
that
oh
richard
better
feelings
have
governed
me
she
said
in
a
melancholy
and
reproachful
tone
well
well
i
suppose
so
he
said
and
after
an
interval
he
added
abstractedly
this
can
not
however
go
on
no
no
it
can
not
sooner
or
later
it
must
have
come
better
at
once
better
now
what
do
you
mean
richard
she
said
greatly
alarmed
she
knew
not
why
what
are
you
resolving
upon
dear
richard
in
mercy
tell
me
i
implore
of
you
tell
me
why
gertrude
you
seem
to
me
to
fancy
that
because
i
do
talk
about
what
is
passing
that
i
do
see
it
either
now
this
is
quite
a
mistake
said
marston
calmly
and
resolutely
i
have
long
observed
your
growing
dislike
of
mademoiselle
de
barras
i
have
thought
it
over
this
fracas
of
today
has
determined
me
it
is
decisive
i
suppose
you
now
wish
her
to
go
as
earnestly
as
you
once
wished
her
to
stay
you
need
not
answer
i
know
it
i
neither
ask
nor
care
to
whose
fault
i
am
to
attribute
these
changed
feelings
female
caprice
accounts
sufficiently
for
it
but
whatever
the
cause
the
effect
is
undeniable
and
the
only
way
to
deal
satisfactorily
with
it
is
to
dismiss
mademoiselle
at
once
you
need
take
no
part
in
the
matter
i
take
it
upon
myself
tomorrow
morning
she
shall
have
left
this
house
i
have
said
it
and
am
perfectly
resolved
as
he
thus
spoke
as
if
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
any
further
discussion
he
turned
abruptly
from
her
and
left
the
room
the
extreme
agitation
which
she
had
just
undergone
combined
with
her
physical
delicacy
to
bring
on
an
hysterical
attack
and
poor
marston
with
an
aching
head
and
a
heavy
heart
lay
down
upon
her
bed
she
had
swallowed
an
opiate
and
before
ten
upon
that
night
an
eventful
one
as
it
proved
she
had
sunk
into
a
profound
slumber
some
hours
after
this
she
became
in
a
confused
way
conscious
of
her
husband
presence
in
the
room
he
was
walking
with
an
agitated
mien
up
and
down
the
chamber
and
casting
from
time
to
time
looks
of
great
trouble
toward
the
bed
where
she
lay
though
the
presence
of
her
husband
was
a
strange
and
long
unwonted
occurrence
there
at
such
an
hour
and
though
she
felt
the
strangeness
of
the
visit
the
power
of
the
opiate
overwhelmed
her
so
that
she
could
only
see
this
apparition
gliding
slowly
back
and
forward
before
her
with
the
passive
wonder
and
curiosity
with
which
one
awaits
the
issue
of
an
interesting
dream
for
a
time
she
lay
once
more
in
an
uneasy
sleep
but
still
throughout
even
this
she
was
conscious
of
his
presence
and
when
a
little
while
after
she
again
saw
him
he
was
not
walking
to
and
fro
before
the
foot
of
the
bed
but
sitting
beside
her
with
one
hand
laid
upon
the
pillow
on
which
her
head
was
resting
the
other
supporting
his
chin
he
was
looking
steadfastly
upon
her
with
a
changed
face
an
expression
of
bitter
sorrow
compunction
and
tenderness
there
was
not
one
trace
of
sternness
all
was
softened
the
look
was
what
she
fancied
he
might
have
turned
upon
her
had
she
lain
there
dead
ere
yet
the
love
of
their
early
and
union
had
grown
cold
in
his
heart
there
was
something
in
it
which
reminded
her
of
days
and
feelings
gone
never
to
return
and
while
she
looked
in
his
face
with
a
sweet
and
mournful
fascination
tears
unconsciously
wet
the
pillow
on
which
her
poor
head
was
resting
unable
to
speak
unable
to
move
she
heard
him
say
it
was
not
your
fault
gertrude
it
was
not
yours
nor
mine
there
is
a
destiny
in
these
things
too
strong
for
us
past
is
past
what
is
done
is
done
forever
and
even
were
it
all
to
do
over
again
what
power
have
i
to
mend
it
no
no
how
could
i
contend
against
the
combined
power
of
passions
circumstances
influences
in
a
word
of
fate
you
have
been
good
and
patient
while
i
but
no
matter
your
lot
gertrude
is
a
happier
one
than
mine
marston
heard
him
and
saw
him
but
she
had
not
the
power
nor
even
the
will
herself
to
speak
or
move
he
appeared
before
her
passive
sense
like
the
phantasm
of
a
dream
he
stood
up
at
the
bedside
and
looked
on
her
steadfastly
with
the
same
melancholy
expression
for
a
moment
he
stooped
over
her
as
if
about
to
kiss
her
face
but
checked
himself
stood
erect
again
at
the
bedside
then
suddenly
turned
the
curtain
fell
back
into
its
place
and
she
saw
him
no
more
with
a
strange
mixture
of
sweet
and
bitter
feelings
this
vision
rested
upon
the
memory
of
marston
until
gradually
deep
slumber
again
overcame
her
senses
and
the
incident
and
all
its
attendant
circumstances
faded
into
oblivion
it
was
past
eight
when
marston
awoke
next
morning
the
sun
was
shining
richly
and
cheerily
in
at
the
windows
and
as
the
remembrance
of
marston
visit
to
her
chamber
and
the
unwonted
manifestations
of
tenderness
and
compunction
which
accompanied
it
returned
she
felt
something
like
hope
and
happiness
to
which
she
had
long
been
a
stranger
flutter
her
heart
the
pleasing
reverie
to
which
she
was
yielding
was
however
interrupted
the
sound
of
stifled
sobbing
in
the
room
reached
her
ear
and
pushing
back
the
and
leaning
forward
to
look
she
saw
her
maid
willett
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
wall
crying
bitterly
and
striving
as
it
seemed
to
stifle
her
sobs
with
her
apron
which
was
wrapped
about
her
face
willet
willett
is
it
you
who
are
sobbing
what
is
the
matter
with
you
child
said
marston
anxiously
the
girl
checked
herself
dried
her
eyes
hastily
and
walking
briskly
to
a
little
distance
as
if
engaged
in
arranging
the
chamber
she
said
with
an
affectation
of
carelessness
oh
it
is
nothing
nothing
at
all
indeed
marston
remained
silent
for
a
time
while
all
her
vague
apprehensions
returned
meantime
the
girl
continued
to
shove
the
chairs
hither
and
thither
and
to
arrange
and
disarrange
everything
in
the
room
with
a
fidgety
industry
intended
to
cover
her
agitation
a
few
minutes
however
served
to
weary
her
of
this
for
she
abruptly
stopped
stood
by
the
bedside
and
looking
at
her
mistress
burst
into
tears
good
god
what
is
it
said
marston
shocked
and
even
terrified
while
new
alarms
displaced
her
old
ones
is
miss
rhoda
can
it
be
is
she
is
my
darling
well
oh
yes
answered
the
maid
very
well
she
is
up
and
out
walking
and
knows
nothing
of
all
this
all
what
urged
marston

me
willett
what
has
happened
what
is
it
speak
child
say
what
it
is
oh

poor
dear
mistress
continued
the
girl
and
stopped
almost
stifled
with
sobs
willett
you
must
speak
you
must
say
what
is
the
matter
i
implore
of
you
desire
you
urged
the
distracted
lady
still
the
girl
having
made
one
or
two
ineffectual
efforts
to
speak
continued
to
sob
willett
you
will
drive
me
mad
for
mercy
sake
for
god
sake
speak
tell
me
what
it
is
cried
the
unhappy
lady
oh

about
the
master
sobbed
the
girl
why

ca
he
has
not
oh
merciful
god
he
has
not
hurt
himself
she
almost
screamed
no
no
not
himself
no
no
but
and
again
she
hesitated
but
what
speak
out
willett
dear
willett
have
mercy
on
me
and
speak
out
cried
her
wretched
mistress
oh
do
be
fretted

take
it
to
heart
said
the
maid
clasping
her
hands
together
in
anguish
anything
anything
willett
only
speak
at
once
she
answered
well
it
is
soon
said
it
is
easy
told
the
master
the
master
is
gone
with
the
frenchwoman
they
went
in
the
traveling
coach
last
night
he
is
gone
away
with
her
that
is
all
marston
looked
at
the
girl
with
a
gaze
of
stupefied
stony
terror
not
a
muscle
of
her
face
moved
not
one
heaving
respiration
showed
that
she
was
living
motionless
with
this
fearful
look
fixed
upon
the
girl
and
her
thin
hands
stretched
towards
her
she
remained
second
after
second
at
last
her
outstretched
hands
began
to
tremble
more
and
more
violently
and
as
if
for
the
first
time
the
knowledge
of
this
calamity
had
reached
her
with
a
cry
as
though
body
and
soul
were
parting
she
fell
back
motionless
in
her
bed
several
hours
had
passed
before
marston
was
restored
to
consciousness
to
this
state
of
utter
insensibility
one
of
silent
terrified
stupor
succeeded
and
it
was
not
until
she
saw
her
daughter
rhoda
standing
at
her
bedside
weeping
that
she
found
voice
and
recollection
to
speak
my
child
my
darling
my
poor
child
she
cried
sobbing
piteously
as
she
drew
her
to
her
heart
and
looked
in
her
face
alternately
my
darling
my
darling
child
rhoda
could
only
weep
and
return
her
poor
mother
caresses
in
silence
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
understand
the
full
extent
and
nature
of
this
direful
calamity
the
strange
occurrence
the
general
and
apparent
consternation
of
the
whole
household
and
the
spectacle
of
her
agony
had
filled
her
with
fear
perplexity
and
anguish
scared
and
stunned
with
a
vague
sense
of
danger
like
a
young
bird
that
for
the
first
time
cowers
under
a
thunderstorm
she
nestled
in
her
bosom
there
with
a
sense
of
protection
and
of
boundless
love
and
tenderness
she
lay
frightened
wondering
and
weeping
two
or
three
days
passed
and
danvers
came
and
sate
for
several
hours
with
poor
marston
to
comfort
and
console
were
of
course
out
of
his
power
the
nature
of
the
bereavement
far
more
terrible
than
death
its
recent
occurrence
the
distracting
consciousness
of
all
its
complicated
consequences
rendered
this
a
hopeless
task
she
bowed
herself
under
the
blow
with
the
submission
of
a
broken
heart
the
hope
to
which
she
had
clung
for
years
had
vanished
the
worst
that
ever
her
imagination
feared
had
come
in
earnest
one
idea
was
now
constantly
present
in
her
mind
she
felt
a
sad
but
immovable
assurance
that
she
should
not
live
long
and
the
thought
what
will
become
of
my
darling
when
i
am
gone
who
will
guard
and
love
my
child
when
i
am
in
my
grave
to
whom
is
she
to
look
for
tenderness
and
protection
then
perpetually
haunted
her
and
superadded
the
pangs
of
a
still
wilder
despair
to
the
desolation
of
a
broken
heart
it
was
not
for
more
than
a
week
after
this
event
that
one
day
willett
with
a
certain
air
of
anxious
mystery
entered
the
silent
and
darkened
chamber
where
marston
lay
she
had
a
letter
in
her
hand
the
seal
and
handwriting
were
marston
it
was
long
before
the
injured
wife
was
able
to
open
it
when
she
did
so
the
following
sentences
met
her
eye
gertrude
you
can
be
ignorant
neither
of
the
nature
nor
of
the
consequences
of
the
decisive
step
i
have
taken
i
do
not
seek
to
excuse
it
for
the
censure
of
the
world
its
meddling
and
mouthing
hypocrisy
i
care
absolutely
nothing
i
have
long
set
it
at
defiance
and
you
yourself
gertrude
when
you
deliberately
reconsider
the
circumstances
of
estrangement
and
coldness
under
which
though
beneath
the
same
roof
we
have
lived
for
years
without
either
sympathy
or
confidence
can
scarcely
if
at
all
regret
the
rupture
of
a
tie
which
had
long
ceased
to
be
anything
better
than
an
irksome
and
galling
formality
i
do
not
desire
to
attribute
to
you
the
smallest
blame
there
was
an
incompatibility
not
of
temper
but
of
feelings
which
made
us
strangers
though
calling
one
another
man
and
wife
upon
this
fact
i
rest
my
own
justification
our
living
together
under
these
circumstances
was
i
dare
say
equally
undesired
by
us
both
it
was
in
fact
but
a
deference
to
the
formal
hypocrisy
of
the
world
at
all
events
the
irrevocable
act
which
separates
us
forever
is
done
and
i
have
now
merely
to
state
so
much
of
my
intentions
as
may
relate
in
anywise
to
your
future
arrangements
i
have
written
to
your
cousin
and
former
guardian
latimer
telling
him
how
matters
stand
between
us
you
i
told
him
shall
have
without
opposition
from
me
the
whole
of
your
own
fortune
to
your
own
separate
use
together
with
whatever
shall
be
mutually
agreed
upon
as
reasonable
from
my
income
for
your
support
and
that
of
my
daughter
it
will
be
necessary
to
complete
your
arrangements
with
expedition
as
i
purpose
returning
to
gray
forest
in
about
three
weeks
and
as
of
course
a
meeting
between
you
and
those
by
whom
i
shall
be
accompanied
is
wholly
out
of
the
question
you
will
see
the
expediency
of
losing
no
time
in
adjusting
everything
for
yours
and
my
daughter
departure
in
the
details
of
course
i
shall
not
interfere
i
think
i
have
made
myself
clearly
intelligible
and
would
recommend
your
communicating
at
once
with
latimer
with
a
view
to
completing
temporary
arrangements
until
your
final
plans
shall
have
been
decided
upon
richard
marston
the
reader
can
easily
conceive
the
feelings
with
which
this
letter
was
perused
we
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
them
nor
shall
we
weary
his
patience
by
a
detail
of
all
the
circumstances
attending
departure
suffice
it
to
mention
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
after
the
receipt
of
the
letter
which
we
have
just
copied
she
had
forever
left
the
mansion
of
gray
forest
in
a
small
house
in
a
sequestered
part
of
the
rich
county
of
warwick
the
residence
of
marston
and
her
daughter
was
for
the
present
fixed
and
there
for
a
time
the
and
desolate
lady
enjoyed
at
least
the
privilege
of
an
immunity
from
the
intrusions
of
all
external
trouble
but
the
blow
under
which
the
feeble
remains
of
her
health
and
strength
were
gradually
to
sink
had
struck
too
surely
home
and
from
month
to
month
almost
from
week
to
week
the
progress
of
decay
was
perceptible
meanwhile
though
grieved
and
humbled
and
longing
to
comfort
his
unhappy
mother
charles
marston
for
the
present
absolutely
dependant
upon
his
father
had
no
choice
but
to
remain
at
cambridge
and
to
pursue
his
studies
there
at
gray
forest
marston
and
the
partner
of
his
guilt
continued
to
live
the
old
servants
were
all
gradually
dismissed
and
new
ones
hired
by
mademoiselle
de
barras
there
they
dwelt
shunned
by
everybody
in
a
stricter
and
more
desolate
seclusion
than
ever
the
novelty
of
the
unrestraint
and
licence
of
their
new
mode
of
life
speedily
passed
away
and
with
it
the
excited
and
guilty
sense
of
relief
which
had
for
a
time
produced
a
false
and
hollow
gaiety
the
sense
of
security
prompted
in
mademoiselle
a
hundred
indulgences
which
in
her
former
precarious
position
she
would
not
have
dreamed
of
outbreaks
of
temper
sharp
and
sometimes
violent
began
to
manifest
themselves
on
her
part
and
renewed
disappointment
and
blacker
remorse
to
darken
the
soul
of
marston
himself
often
in
the
dead
of
the
night
the
servants
would
overhear
their
bitter
and
fierce
altercations
ringing
through
the
melancholy
mansion
and
often
the
reckless
use
of
terrible
and
mysterious
epithets
of
crime
their
quarrels
increased
in
violence
and
in
frequency
and
before
two
years
had
passed
feelings
of
bitterness
hatred
and
dread
alone
seemed
to
subsist
between
them
yet
upon
marston
she
continued
to
exercise
a
powerful
and
mysterious
influence
there
was
a
dogged
apathetic
submission
on
his
part
and
a
growing
insolence
on
hers
constantly
more
and
more
strikingly
visible
neglect
disorder
and
decay
too
were
more
than
ever
apparent
in
the
dreary
air
of
the
place
doctor
danvers
save
by
rumor
and
conjecture
knew
nothing
of
marston
and
his
abandoned
companion
he
had
more
than
once
felt
a
strong
disposition
to
visit
gray
forest
and
expostulate
face
to
face
with
its
guilty
proprietor
this
idea
however
he
had
upon
consideration
dismissed
not
on
account
of
any
shrinking
from
the
possible
repulses
and
affronts
to
which
the
attempt
might
subject
him
but
from
a
thorough
conviction
that
the
endeavor
would
be
utterly
fruitless
for
good
while
it
might
very
obviously
expose
him
to
painful
misinterpretation
and
suspicion
and
leave
it
to
be
imagined
that
he
had
been
influenced
if
by
no
meaner
motive
at
least
by
the
promptings
of
a
coarse
curiosity
meanwhile
he
maintained
a
correspondence
with
marston
and
had
even
once
or
twice
since
her
departure
visited
her
latterly
however
this
correspondence
had
been
a
good
deal
interrupted
and
its
intervals
had
been
supplied
occasionally
by
rhoda
whose
letters
although
she
herself
appeared
unconscious
of
the
mournful
event
the
approach
of
which
they
too
plainly
indicated
were
painful
records
of
the
rapid
progress
of
mortal
decay
he
had
just
received
one
of
those
ominous
letters
at
the
little
post
office
in
the
town
we
have
already
mentioned
and
full
of
the
melancholy
news
it
contained
danvers
was
returning
slowly
towards
his
home
as
he
rode
into
a
lonely
road
traversing
an
undulating
tract
of
some
three
miles
in
length
the
singularity
it
may
be
of
his
costume
attracted
the
eye
of
another
passenger
who
was
as
it
turned
out
no
other
than
marston
himself
for
two
or
three
miles
of
this
desolate
road
their
ways
happened
to
lie
together
marston
first
impulse
was
to
avoid
the
clergyman
his
second
which
he
obeyed
was
to
join
company
and
ride
along
with
him
at
all
events
for
so
long
as
would
show
that
he
shrank
from
no
encounter
which
fortune
or
accident
presented
there
was
a
spirit
of
bitter
defiance
in
this
which
cost
him
a
painful
effort
how
do
you
do
parson
danvers
said
marston
touching
his
hat
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
danvers
thought
he
had
seldom
seen
a
man
so
changed
in
so
short
a
time
his
face
had
grown
sallow
and
wasted
and
his
figure
slightly
stooped
with
an
appearance
almost
of
feebleness
marston
said
the
clergyman
gravely
and
almost
sternly
though
with
some
embarrassment
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
and
i
have
seen
one
another
and
many
and
painful
events
have
passed
in
the
interval
i
scarce
know
upon
what
terms
we
meet
i
am
prompted
to
speak
to
you
and
in
a
tone
perhaps
which
you
will
hardly
brook
and
yet
if
we
keep
company
as
it
seems
likely
we
may
i
can
not
and
i
ought
not
to
be
silent
well
danvers
i
accept
the
condition
speak
what
you
will
said
marston
with
a
gloomy
promptitude
if
you
exceed
your
privilege
and
grow
uncivil
i
need
but
use
my
spurs
and
leave
you
behind
me
preaching
to
the
winds
ah
marston
said
danvers
almost
sadly
after
a
considerable
pause
when
i
saw
you
close
beside
me
my
heart
was
troubled
within
me
you
looked
on
me
as
something
from
the
nether
world
and
expected
to
see
the
cloven
hoof
said
marston
bitterly
and
raising
his
booted
foot
a
little
as
he
spoke
but
after
all
i
am
but
a
vulgar
sinner
of
flesh
and
blood
without
enough
of
the
preternatural
about
me
to
frighten
an
old
nurse
much
less
to
agitate
a
pillar
of
the
church
marston
you
talk
sarcastically
but
you
feel
that
recent
circumstances
as
well
as
old
recollections
might
well
disturb
and
trouble
me
at
sight
of
you
answered
danvers
well
yes
perhaps
it
is
so
said
marston
hastily
and
sullenly
and
became
silent
for
a
while
my
heart
is
full
marston
charged
with
grief
when
i
think
of
the
sad
history
of
those
with
whom
in
my
mind
you
must
ever
be
associated
said
doctor
danvers
aye
to
be
sure
said
marston
with
stern
impatience
but
then
you
have
much
to
console
you
you
have
got
your
comforts
and
your
respectability
all
the
dearer
too
from
the
contrast
of
other
misfortunes
and
degradations
then
you
have
your
religion
moreover
yes
interrupted
danvers
earnestly
and
hastening
to
avoid
a
sneer
upon
this
subject
god
be
blessed
i
am
an
humble
follower
of
his
gracious
son
our
redeemer
and
though
i
trust
i
should
bear
with
patient
submission
whatever
chastisement
in
his
wisdom
and
goodness
he
might
see
fit
to
inflict
upon
me
yet
i
do
praise
and
bless
him
for
the
mercy
which
has
hitherto
spared
me
and
i
do
feel
that
mercy
all
the
more
profoundly
from
the
afflictions
and
troubles
with
which
i
daily
see
others
overtaken
and
in
the
matter
of
piety
and
decorum
doubtless
you
bless
god
also
said
marston
sarcastically
that
you
are
not
as
other
men
are
nor
even
as
this
publican
nay
marston
god
forbid
i
should
harden
my
sinful
heart
with
the
wicked
pride
of
the
pharisee
evil
and
corrupt
am
i
already
over
much
too
well
i
know
the
vileness
of
my
heart
to
make
myself
righteous
in
my
own
eyes
replied
danvers
humbly
but
sinner
as
i
am
i
am
yet
a
messenger
of
god
whose
mission
is
one
of
authority
to
his
and
woe
is
me
if
i
speak
not
the
truth
at
all
seasons
and
in
all
places
where
my
words
may
be
profitably
heard
well
doctor
danvers
it
seems
you
think
it
your
duty
to
speak
to
me
of
course
respecting
my
conduct
and
my
spiritual
state
i
shall
save
you
the
pain
and
trouble
of
opening
the
subject
i
shall
state
the
case
for
you
in
two
words
said
marston
almost
fiercely
i
have
put
away
my
wife
without
just
cause
and
am
living
in
sin
with
another
woman
come
what
have
you
to
say
on
this
theme
speak
out
deal
with
me
as
roughly
as
you
will
i
will
hear
it
and
answer
you
again
alas
marston
and
do
not
these
things
trouble
you
exclaimed
danvers
earnestly
do
they
not
weigh
heavy
upon
your
conscience
ah
sir
do
you
not
remember
that
slowly
and
surely
you
are
drawing
towards
the
hour
of
death
and
the
day
of
judgment
the
hour
or
death
yes
i
know
it
is
coming
and
i
await
it
with
indifference
but
for
the
day
of
judgment
with
its
books
and
trumpets
my
dear
doctor
pray
do
expect
to
frighten
me
with
that
marston
spoke
with
an
angry
scorn
which
had
the
effect
of
interrupting
the
conversation
for
some
moments
they
rode
on
side
by
side
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
at
length
however
marston
unexpectedly
broke
the
silence
doctor
danvers
said
he
you
asked
me
some
time
ago
if
i
feared
the
hour
of
death
and
the
day
of
judgment
i
answered
you
truly
i
do
not
fear
them
nay
death
i
think
i
could
meet
with
a
happier
and
a
quieter
heart
than
any
other
chance
that
can
befall
me
but
there
are
other
fears
fears
that
do
trouble
me
much
doctor
danvers
looked
inquiringly
at
him
but
neither
spoke
for
a
time
you
have
not
seen
the
catastrophe
of
the
tragedy
yet
said
marston
with
a
stern
stony
look
made
more
horrible
by
a
forced
smile
and
something
like
a
shudder
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
you
doctor
danvers
for
you
are
honorable
and
i
wish
i
durst
tell
you
what
i
fear
the
only
only
thing
i
really
do
fear
no
mortal
knows
it
but
myself
and
i
see
it
coming
upon
me
with
slow
but
unconquerable
power
oh
god
dreadful
spirit
spare
me
again
they
were
silent
and
again
marston
resumed
doctor
danvers
do
mistake
me
he
said
turning
sharply
and
fixing
his
eyes
with
a
strange
expression
upon
his
companion
i
dread
nothing
human
i
fear
neither
death
nor
disgrace
nor
eternity
i
have
no
secrets
to
keep
no
exposures
to
apprehend
but
i
dread
i
dread
he
paused
scowled
darkly
as
if
stung
with
pain
turned
away
muttering
to
himself
and
gradually
became
much
excited
i
ca
tell
you
now
sir
and
i
wo
he
said
abruptly
and
fiercely
and
with
a
countenance
darkened
with
a
wild
and
appalling
rage
that
was
wholly
unaccountable
i
see
you
searching
me
with
your
eyes
suspect
what
you
will
sir
you
sha
inveigle
me
into
admissions
aye
pry
whisper
stare
question
conjecture
sir
i
suppose
i
must
endure
the
world
impertinence
but
d
n
me
if
i
gratify
it
it
would
not
be
easy
to
describe
danvers
astonishment
at
this
unaccountable
explosion
of
fury
he
was
resolved
however
to
bear
his
companion
violence
with
temper
they
rode
on
slowly
for
fully
ten
minutes
in
utter
silence
except
that
marston
occasionally
muttered
to
himself
as
it
seemed
in
excited
abstraction
danvers
had
at
first
felt
naturally
offended
at
the
violent
and
insulting
tone
in
which
he
had
been
so
unexpectedly
and
unprovokedly
addressed
but
this
feeling
of
irritation
was
but
transient
and
some
fearful
suspicions
as
to
marston
sanity
flitted
through
his
mind
in
a
calmer
and
more
dogged
tone
his
companion
now
addressed
him
there
is
little
profit
you
see
doctor
in
worrying
me
about
your
religion
said
marston
it
is
but
sowing
the
wind
and
reaping
the
whirlwind
and
to
say
the
truth
the
longer
you
pursue
it
the
less
i
am
in
the
mood
to
listen
if
ever
you
are
cursed
and
persecuted
as
i
have
been
you
will
understand
how
little
tolerant
of
gratuitous
vexations
and
contradictions
a
man
may
become
we
have
squabbled
over
religion
long
enough
and
each
holds
his
own
faith
still
continue
to
sun
yourself
in
your
happy
delusions
and
leave
me
untroubled
to
tread
the
way
of
my
own
dark
and
cheerless
destiny
thus
saying
he
made
a
sullen
gesture
of
farewell
and
spurring
his
horse
crossed
the
broken
fence
at
the
roadside
and
so
at
a
listless
pace
through
gaps
and
by
penetrated
towards
his
melancholy
and
guilty
home
two
years
had
now
passed
since
the
decisive
event
which
had
forever
separated
marston
from
her
who
had
loved
him
so
devotedly
and
so
fatally
two
years
to
him
of
disappointment
abasement
and
secret
rage
two
years
to
her
of
gentle
and
submission
to
the
chastening
hand
of
heaven
at
the
end
of
this
time
she
died
marston
read
the
letter
that
announced
the
event
with
a
stern
look
and
silently
but
the
shock
he
felt
was
terrific
no
man
is
so
to
despair
and
degradation
that
at
some
casual
moment
thoughts
of
amendment
some
gleams
of
hope
however
faint
and
transient
from
the
distant
future
will
not
visit
him
with
marston
those
thoughts
had
somehow
ever
been
associated
with
vague
ideas
of
a
reconciliation
with
the
being
whom
he
had
forsaken
good
and
pure
and
looking
at
her
from
the
darkness
and
distance
of
his
own
fallen
state
almost
angelic
as
she
seemed
but
she
was
now
dead
he
could
make
her
no
atonement
she
could
never
smile
forgiveness
upon
him
this
image
the
last
that
had
reflected
for
him
one
ray
of
the
lost
peace
and
love
of
happier
times
had
vanished
and
henceforward
there
was
before
him
nothing
but
storm
and
fear
marston
embarrassed
fortunes
made
it
to
him
an
object
to
resume
the
portion
of
his
income
heretofore
devoted
to
the
separate
maintenance
of
his
wife
and
daughter
in
order
to
effect
this
it
became
of
course
necessary
to
recall
his
daughter
rhoda
and
fix
her
residence
once
more
at
gray
forest
no
more
dreadful
penalty
could
have
been
inflicted
upon
the
poor
girl
no
more
agonizing
ordeal
than
that
she
was
thus
doomed
to
undergo
she
had
idolized
her
mother
and
now
adored
her
memory
she
knew
that
mademoiselle
de
barras
had
betrayed
and
indirectly
murdered
the
parent
she
had
so
devotedly
loved
she
knew
that
that
woman
had
been
the
curse
the
fate
of
her
family
and
she
regarded
her
naturally
with
feelings
of
mingled
terror
and
abhorrence
the
intensity
of
which
was
indescribable
the
few
scattered
friends
and
relatives
whose
sympathies
had
been
moved
by
the
melancholy
fate
of
poor
marston
were
unanimously
agreed
that
the
intended
removal
of
the
young
and
innocent
daughter
to
the
polluted
mansion
of
sin
and
shame
was
too
intolerably
revolting
to
be
permitted
but
each
of
these
virtuous
individuals
unhappily
thought
it
the
duty
of
the
others
to
interpose
and
with
a
running
commentary
of
wonder
and
reprobation
and
much
virtuous
criticism
events
were
suffered
uninterruptedly
to
take
their
sinister
and
melancholy
course
it
was
about
two
months
after
the
death
of
marston
and
on
a
bleak
and
ominous
night
at
the
wintry
end
of
autumn
that
poor
rhoda
in
deep
mourning
and
pale
with
grief
and
agitation
descended
from
a
chaise
at
the
door
of
the
mansion
of
gray
forest
whether
from
consideration
for
her
feelings
or
as
was
more
probable
from
pure
indifference
rhoda
was
conducted
on
her
arrival
direct
to
her
own
chamber
and
it
was
not
until
the
next
morning
that
she
saw
her
father
he
entered
her
room
unexpectedly
he
was
very
pale
and
as
she
thought
greatly
altered
but
he
seemed
perfectly
collected
and
free
from
agitation
the
marked
and
even
shocking
change
in
his
appearance
and
perhaps
even
the
trifling
though
painful
circumstance
that
he
wore
no
mourning
for
the
beloved
being
who
was
gone
caused
her
after
a
mute
gazing
in
his
face
to
burst
into
an
irrepressible
flood
of
tears
marston
waited
stoically
until
the
paroxysm
had
subsided
and
then
taking
her
hand
with
a
look
in
which
a
dogged
sternness
was
contending
with
something
like
shame
he
said
there
there
you
can
weep
when
i
am
gone
i
sha
say
very
much
to
you
at
present
rhoda
and
only
wish
you
to
attend
to
me
for
one
minute
listen
rhoda
the
lady
whom
you
have
been
in
the
habit
here
he
slightly
averted
his
eyes
of
calling
mademoiselle
de
barras
is
no
longer
so
she
is
married
she
is
my
wife
and
consequently
you
will
treat
her
with
the
respect
due
to
he
would
have
said
a
mother
but
could
not
and
supplied
the
phrase
by
adding
to
that
relation
rhoda
was
unable
to
speak
but
almost
unconsciously
bowed
her
head
in
token
of
attention
and
submission
and
her
father
pressed
her
hand
more
kindly
as
he
continued
i
have
always
found
you
a
dutiful
and
obedient
child
rhoda
and
expected
no
other
conduct
from
you
marston
will
treat
you
with
proper
kindness
and
consideration
and
desires
me
to
say
that
you
can
whenever
you
please
keep
strictly
to
yourself
and
need
not
unless
you
feel
so
disposed
attend
the
regular
meals
of
the
family
this
privilege
may
suit
your
present
depressed
spirits
and
you
must
not
scruple
to
use
it
after
a
few
words
more
marston
withdrew
leaving
his
daughter
to
her
reflections
and
bleak
and
bitter
enough
they
were
some
weeks
passed
away
and
perhaps
we
shall
best
consult
our
ease
by
substituting
for
the
formal
precision
of
narrative
a
few
extracts
from
the
letters
which
rhoda
wrote
to
her
brother
still
at
cambridge
these
will
convey
her
own
impressions
respecting
the
scenes
and
personages
among
whom
she
was
now
to
move
the
house
and
place
are
much
neglected
and
the
former
in
some
parts
suffered
almost
to
go
to
decay
the
windows
broken
in
the
last
storm
nearly
eight
months
ago
they
tell
me
are
still
unmended
and
the
roof
too
unrepaired
the
pretty
garden
near
the
well
among
the
lime
trees
that
our
darling
mother
was
so
fond
of
is
all
but
obliterated
with
weeds
and
grass
and
since
my
first
visit
i
have
not
had
heart
to
go
near
it
again
all
the
old
servants
are
gone
new
faces
everywhere
i
have
been
obliged
several
times
through
fear
of
offending
my
father
to
join
the
party
in
the
drawing
room
you
may
conceive
what
i
felt
at
seeing
mademoiselle
in
the
place
once
filled
by
our
dear
mamma
i
was
so
choked
with
sorrow
bitterness
and
indignation
and
my
heart
so
palpitated
that
i
could
not
speak
and
i
believe
they
thought
i
was
going
to
faint
mademoiselle
looked
very
angry
but
my
father
pretending
to
show
me
heaven
knows
what
from
the
window
led
me
to
it
and
the
air
revived
me
a
little
mademoiselle
for
i
can
not
call
her
by
her
new
name
is
altered
a
good
deal
more
however
in
the
character
than
in
the
contour
of
her
face
and
figure
certainly
however
she
has
grown
a
good
deal
fuller
and
her
color
is
higher
and
whether
it
is
fancy
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
certainly
to
me
it
seems
that
the
expression
of
her
face
has
acquired
something
habitually
lowering
and
malicious
and
which
i
know
not
how
inspires
me
with
an
undefinable
dread
she
has
however
been
tolerably
civil
to
me
but
seems
contemptuous
and
rude
to
my
father
and
i
am
afraid
he
is
very
wretched
i
have
seen
them
exchange
such
looks
and
overheard
such
intemperate
and
even
appalling
altercations
between
them
as
indicate
something
worse
and
deeper
than
ordinary
this
makes
me
additionally
wretched
especially
as
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
some
mysterious
cause
enables
her
to
frighten
and
tyrannise
over
my
poor
father
i
sometimes
think
he
absolutely
detests
her
yet
though
fiery
altercations
ensue
he
ultimately
submits
to
this
bad
and
cruel
woman
oh
my
dear
charles
you
have
no
idea
of
the
shocking
or
rather
the
terrifying
reproaches
i
have
heard
interchanged
between
them
as
i
accidently
passed
the
room
where
they
were
sitting
such
terms
as
have
sent
me
to
my
room
feeling
as
if
i
were
in
a
horrid
dream
and
made
me
cry
and
tremble
for
hours
after
i
got
there
i
see
my
father
very
seldom
and
when
i
do
he
takes
but
little
notice
of
me
poor
willett
you
know
returned
with
me
she
accompanies
me
in
my
walks
and
is
constantly
dropping
hints
about
mademoiselle
from
which
i
know
not
what
to
gather
i
often
fear
that
my
father
has
some
secret
and
mortal
ailment
he
generally
looks
ill
and
sometimes
quite
wretchedly
he
came
twice
lately
to
my
room
i
think
to
speak
to
me
on
some
matter
of
importance
but
he
said
only
a
sentence
or
two
and
even
these
broken
and
incoherent
he
seemed
unable
to
command
spirits
for
the
interview
and
indeed
he
grew
so
agitated
and
strange
that
i
was
alarmed
and
felt
greatly
relieved
when
he
left
me
i
do
not
you
see
disguise
my
feelings
dear
charles
i
do
not
conceal
from
you
the
melancholy
and
anguish
of
my
present
situation
how
intensely
i
long
for
your
promised
arrival
i
have
not
a
creature
to
whom
i
can
say
one
word
in
confidence
except
poor
willett
who
though
very
and
really
dear
to
me
is
yet
far
from
being
a
companion
i
sometimes
think
my
intense
anxiety
to
see
you
here
is
almost
selfish
for
i
know
you
will
feel
as
acutely
as
i
do
the
terrible
change
observable
everywhere
but
i
can
not
help
longing
for
your
return
dear
charles
and
counting
the
days
and
the
very
hours
till
you
arrive
be
cautious
in
writing
to
me
not
to
say
anything
which
you
would
not
wish
mademoiselle
to
see
for
willett
tells
me
that
she
knows
that
she
often
examines
and
even
intercepts
the
letters
that
arrive
and
though
willett
may
be
mistaken
and
i
hope
she
is
yet
it
is
better
that
you
should
be
upon
your
guard
ever
since
i
heard
this
i
have
brought
my
letters
to
the
post
office
myself
instead
of
leaving
them
with
the
rest
upon
the
hall
table
and
you
know
it
is
a
long
walk
for
me
i
go
to
church
every
sunday
and
take
willett
along
with
me
no
one
from
this
seems
to
think
of
doing
so
but
ourselves
i
see
the
mervyns
there
mervyn
is
particularly
kind
and
i
know
that
she
wishes
to
offer
me
an
asylum
at
newton
park
and
you
can
not
think
with
how
much
tenderness
and
delicacy
she
conveys
the
wish
but
i
dare
not
hint
the
subject
to
my
father
and
earnestly
as
i
desire
it
i
could
not
but
feel
that
i
should
go
there
not
to
visit
but
to
reside
and
so
even
in
this
in
many
respects
delightful
project
is
mingled
the
bitter
apprehension
of
dependence
something
so
humiliating
that
kindly
and
delicately
as
the
offer
is
made
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
embrace
it
i
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
you
and
long
to
see
these
extracts
will
enable
the
reader
to
form
a
tolerably
accurate
idea
of
the
general
state
of
affairs
at
gray
forest
some
particulars
must
however
be
added
marston
continued
to
be
the
same
gloomy
and
joyless
being
as
heretofore
sometimes
moody
and
apathetic
sometimes
wayward
and
even
savage
but
never
for
a
moment
at
ease
never
social
an
isolated
disdainful
ruined
man
one
day
as
rhoda
sate
and
read
under
the
shade
of
some
evergreens
in
a
lonely
and
sheltered
part
of
the
neglected
with
her
honest
maid
willett
in
attendance
she
was
surprised
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
her
father
who
stood
unexpectedly
before
her
though
his
attitude
for
some
time
was
fixed
his
countenance
was
troubled
with
anxiety
and
pain
and
his
sunken
eyes
rested
upon
her
with
a
fiery
and
fretted
gaze
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
for
a
while
and
then
touching
willett
sharply
on
the
shoulder
said
abruptly
go
i
shall
call
you
when
you
are
wanted
walk
down
that
alley
and
as
he
spoke
he
indicated
with
his
the
course
he
desired
her
to
take
when
the
maid
was
sufficiently
distant
to
be
quite
out
of
hearing
marston
sate
down
beside
rhoda
upon
the
bench
and
took
her
hand
in
silence
his
grasp
was
cold
and
alternately
relaxed
and
contracted
with
an
agitated
uncertainty
while
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
ground
and
he
seemed
meditating
how
to
open
the
conversation
at
last
as
if
suddenly
awaking
from
a
fearful
reverie
he
said
you
correspond
with
charles
yes
sir
she
replied
with
the
respectful
formality
prescribed
by
the
usages
of
the
time
we
correspond
regularly
aye
aye
and
pray
when
did
you
last
hear
from
him
he
continued
about
a
month
since
sir
she
replied
ha
and
and
was
there
nothing
strange
nothing
nothing
mysterious
and
menacing
in
his
letter
come
come
you
know
what
i
speak
of
he
stopped
abruptly
and
stared
in
her
face
with
an
agitated
gaze
no
indeed
sir
there
was
not
anything
of
the
kind
she
replied
i
have
been
greatly
shocked
i
may
say
incensed
said
marston
excitedly
by
a
passage
in
his
last
letter
to
me
not
that
it
says
anything
specific
but
but
it
amazes
me
it
enrages
me
he
again
checked
himself
and
rhoda
much
surprised
and
even
shocked
said
stammeringly
i
am
sure
sir
that
dear
charles
would
not
intentionally
say
or
do
anything
that
could
offend
you
ah
as
to
that
i
believe
so
too
but
it
is
not
with
him
i
am
indignant
no
no
poor
charles
i
believe
he
is
as
you
say
disposed
to
conduct
himself
as
a
son
ought
to
do
respectfully
and
obediently
yes
yes
charles
is
very
well
but
i
fear
he
is
leading
a
bad
life
notwithstanding
a
very
bad
life
he
is
becoming
subject
to
influences
which
never
visit
or
torment
the
good
believe
me
he
is
marston
shook
his
head
and
muttered
to
himself
with
a
look
of
almost
craven
anxiety
and
then
whispered
to
his
daughter
just
read
this
and
then
tell
me
is
it
not
so
read
it
read
it
and
pronounce
as
he
thus
spoke
he
placed
in
her
hand
the
letter
of
which
he
had
spoken
and
with
the
passage
to
which
he
invited
her
attention
folded
down
it
was
to
the
following
effect
i
can
not
tell
you
how
shocked
i
have
been
by
a
piece
of
scandal
as
i
must
believe
it
conveyed
to
me
in
an
anonymous
letter
and
which
is
of
so
very
delicate
a
nature
that
without
your
special
command
i
should
hesitate
to
pain
you
by
its
recital
i
trust
it
may
be
utterly
false
indeed
i
assume
it
to
be
so
it
is
enough
to
say
that
it
is
of
a
very
distressing
nature
and
affects
the
lady
mademoiselle
de
barras
whom
you
have
recently
honored
with
your
hand
now
you
see
cried
marston
with
a
shuddering
fierceness
as
she
returned
the
letter
with
a
blanched
cheek
and
trembling
hand
now
you
see
it
all
are
you
stupid
the
stamp
of
the
cloven
hoof
eh
rhoda
unable
to
gather
his
meaning
but
at
the
same
time
with
a
heart
full
and
trembling
very
much
stammered
a
few
frightened
words
and
became
silent
it
is
he
i
tell
you
that
does
it
all
and
if
charles
were
not
living
an
evil
life
he
could
not
have
spread
his
nets
for
him
said
marston
vehemently
he
ca
go
near
anything
good
but
like
a
scoundrel
he
knows
where
to
find
a
congenial
nature
and
when
he
does
he
has
skill
enough
to
practice
upon
it
i
know
him
well
and
his
arts
and
his
smiles
aye
and
his
scowls
and
his
grins
too
he
goes
like
his
master
up
and
down
and
to
and
fro
upon
the
earth
for
ceaseless
mischief
there
is
not
a
friend
of
mine
he
can
get
hold
of
but
he
whispered
in
his
ear
some
damned
slander
of
me
he
is
drawing
them
all
into
a
common
understanding
against
me
and
he
takes
an
actual
pleasure
in
telling
me
how
the
thing
goes
on
how
one
after
the
other
he
has
converted
my
friends
into
conspirators
and
libelers
to
blast
my
character
and
take
my
life
and
now
the
monster
essays
to
lure
my
children
into
the
hellish
confederation
who
is
he
father
who
is
he
faltered
rhoda
you
never
saw
him
retorted
marston
sternly
no
no
you
ca
have
seen
him
and
you
probably
never
will
but
if
he
does
come
here
again
do
listen
to
him
he
is
and
and
no
good
comes
of
his
mouthing
and
muttering
avoid
him
i
warn
you
avoid
him
let
me
see
how
shall
i
describe
him
let
me
see
you
remember
you
remember
berkley
sir
wynston
berkley
well
he
greatly
resembles
that
dead
villain
he
has
all
the
same
grins
and
shrugs
and
monkey
airs
and
his
face
and
figure
are
like
but
he
is
a
grimed
ragged
wasted
piece
of
sin
little
better
than
a
beggar
a
shrunken
malignant
libel
on
the
human
shape
avoid
him
i
tell
you
avoid
him
he
is
steeped
in
lies
and
poison
like
the
very
serpent
that
betrayed
us
beware
of
him
i
say
for
if
he
once
gains
your
ear
he
will
delude
you
spite
of
all
your
vigilance
he
will
make
you
his
accomplice
and
thenceforth
inevitably
there
is
nothing
but
mortal
and
implacable
hatred
between
us
frightened
at
this
wild
language
rhoda
did
not
answer
but
looked
up
in
his
face
in
silence
a
fearful
transformation
was
there
a
scowl
so
livid
and
maniacal
that
her
very
senses
seemed
leaving
her
with
terror
perhaps
the
sudden
alteration
observable
in
her
countenance
as
this
spectacle
so
unexpectedly
encountered
her
recalled
him
to
himself
for
he
added
hurriedly
and
in
a
tone
of
gentler
meaning
rhoda
rhoda
watch
and
pray
my
daughter
my
child
keep
your
heart
pure
and
nothing
bad
can
approach
you
for
no
no
you
are
good
and
the
good
need
not
fear
suddenly
marston
burst
into
tears
as
he
ended
this
sentence
and
wept
long
and
convulsively
she
did
not
dare
to
speak
or
even
to
move
but
after
a
while
he
ceased
appeared
uneasy
half
ashamed
and
half
angry
and
looking
with
a
horrified
and
bewildered
glance
into
her
face
he
said
rhoda
child
what
what
have
i
said
my
god
what
have
i
been
saying
did
i
do
i
look
ill
oh
rhoda
rhoda
may
you
never
feel
this
he
turned
away
from
her
without
awaiting
her
answer
and
walked
away
with
the
appearance
of
intense
agitation
as
if
to
leave
her
he
turned
again
however
and
with
a
face
pallid
and
sunken
as
death
approached
her
slowly
rhoda
said
he
do
tell
what
i
have
said
to
anyone
do
i
conjure
you
even
to
charles
i
speak
too
much
at
random
and
say
more
than
i
mean
a
foolish
rambling
habit
so
do
not
repeat
one
word
of
it
not
one
word
to
any
living
mortal
you
and
i
rhoda
must
have
our
little
secrets
he
ended
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
so
obviously
painful
and
that
as
he
walked
hurriedly
away
the
astounded
girl
burst
into
a
bitter
flood
of
tears
what
was
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
the
shocking
scene
she
had
then
been
forced
to
witness
she
dared
not
answer
the
question
yet
one
ghastly
doubt
haunted
her
like
her
shadow
a
suspicion
that
the
malignant
and
hideous
light
of
madness
was
already
glaring
upon
his
mind
as
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
her
astonished
attendant
she
retracted
her
steps
the
trees
the
flowers
the
familiar
the
echoing
passages
every
object
that
met
her
eye
seemed
strange
and
unsubstantial
and
she
gliding
on
among
them
in
a
horrid
dream
time
passed
on
there
was
no
renewal
of
the
painful
scene
which
dwelt
so
sensibly
in
the
affrighted
imagination
of
rhoda
marston
manner
was
changed
towards
her
he
seemed
shy
cowed
and
uneasy
in
her
presence
and
thenceforth
she
saw
less
than
ever
of
him
meanwhile
the
time
approached
which
was
to
witness
the
long
expected
and
by
rhoda
the
intensely
prayed
for
arrival
of
her
brother
some
four
or
five
days
before
this
event
marston
having
as
he
said
some
business
in
chester
and
further
designing
to
meet
his
son
there
took
his
departure
from
gray
forest
leaving
poor
rhoda
to
the
guardianship
of
her
guilty
stepmother
and
although
she
had
seen
so
little
of
her
father
yet
the
very
consciousness
of
his
presence
had
given
her
a
certain
confidence
and
sense
of
security
which
vanished
at
the
moment
of
his
departure
and
wretched
as
he
had
been
his
removal
nevertheless
seemed
to
her
to
render
the
lonely
and
inauspicious
mansion
still
more
desolate
and
ominous
than
before
she
had
with
a
vague
and
instinctive
antipathy
avoided
all
contact
and
intercourse
with
marston
or
as
for
distinctness
sake
we
shall
continue
to
call
her
mademoiselle
since
her
return
and
she
on
her
part
had
appeared
to
acquiesce
with
a
sort
of
scornful
nonchalance
in
the
tacit
understanding
that
she
and
her
former
pupil
should
see
and
hear
as
little
as
might
be
of
one
another
meanwhile
poor
willett
with
her
honesty
and
her
inexhaustible
gossip
endeavored
to
amuse
and
reassure
her
young
mistress
and
sometimes
even
with
some
partial
success
we
must
now
follow
marston
in
his
solitary
expedition
to
chester
when
he
took
his
place
in
the
stagecoach
he
had
the
whole
interior
of
the
vehicle
to
himself
and
thus
continued
to
be
its
solitary
occupant
for
several
miles
the
coach
however
was
eventually
hailed
brought
to
and
the
door
being
opened
danvers
got
in
and
took
his
place
opposite
to
the
passenger
already
established
there
the
worthy
man
was
so
busied
in
directing
the
disposition
of
his
luggage
from
the
window
and
in
arranging
the
sundry
small
parcels
with
which
he
was
charged
that
he
did
not
recognize
his
companion
until
they
were
in
motion
when
he
did
so
it
was
with
no
very
pleasurable
feeling
and
it
is
probable
that
marston
too
would
have
gladly
escaped
the
coincidence
which
thus
reduced
them
once
more
to
the
temporary
necessity
of
a
embarrassing
as
each
felt
the
situation
to
be
there
was
however
no
avoiding
it
and
after
a
recognition
and
a
few
forced
attempts
at
conversation
they
became
by
mutual
consent
silent
and
uncommunicative
the
journey
though
in
point
of
space
a
mere
trifle
was
in
those
slowcoach
days
a
matter
of
fully
five
hours
duration
and
before
it
was
completed
the
sun
had
set
and
darkness
began
to
close
whether
it
was
that
the
descending
twilight
dispelled
the
painful
constraint
under
which
marston
had
seemed
to
labor
or
that
some
more
purely
spiritual
and
genial
influence
had
gradually
dissipated
the
repulsion
and
distrust
with
which
at
first
he
had
shrunk
from
a
renewal
of
intercourse
with
danvers
he
suddenly
accosted
him
thus
danvers
i
have
been
fifty
times
on
the
point
of
speaking
to
you
confidentially
of
course
while
sitting
here
opposite
to
you
what
i
believe
i
could
scarcely
bring
myself
to
hint
to
any
other
man
living
yet
i
must
tell
it
and
soon
too
or
i
fear
it
will
have
told
itself
danvers
intimated
his
readiness
to
hear
and
advise
if
desired
and
marston
resumed
abruptly
after
a
pause
pray
doctor
danvers
have
you
heard
any
stories
of
an
odd
kind
any
surmises
i
do
mean
of
a
moral
sort
for
those
i
hold
very
cheap
to
my
prejudice
indeed
i
should
hardly
say
to
my
prejudice
i
mean
i
ought
to
say
in
short
have
you
heard
people
remark
upon
any
fancied
eccentricities
or
that
sort
of
thing
about
me
he
put
the
question
with
obvious
difficulty
and
at
last
seemed
to
overcome
his
own
reluctance
with
a
sort
of
angry
and
excited
and
impatience
doctor
danvers
was
a
little
puzzled
by
the
interrogatory
and
admitted
in
reply
that
he
did
not
comprehend
its
drift
doctor
danvers
he
resumed
sternly
and
dejectedly
i
told
you
in
the
chance
interview
we
had
some
months
ago
that
i
was
haunted
by
a
certain
fear
i
did
not
define
it
nor
do
i
think
you
suspect
its
nature
it
is
a
fear
of
nothing
mortal
but
of
the
immortal
tenant
of
this
body
my
mind
sir
is
beginning
to
play
me
tricks
my
guide
mocks
and
terrifies
me
there
was
a
perceptible
tinge
of
horror
in
the
look
of
astonishment
with
which
danvers
listened
you
are
a
gentleman
sir
and
a
christian
clergyman
what
i
have
said
and
shall
say
is
confided
to
your
honor
to
be
held
sacred
as
the
confession
of
misery
and
hidden
from
the
coarse
gaze
of
the
world
i
have
become
subject
to
a
hideous
delusion
it
comes
at
intervals
i
do
not
think
any
mortal
suspects
it
except
maybe
my
daughter
rhoda
it
comes
and
disappears
and
comes
again
i
kept
my
pleasant
secret
for
a
long
time
but
at
last
i
let
it
slip
and
committed
myself
fortunately
to
but
one
person
and
that
my
daughter
and
even
so
i
hardly
think
she
understood
me
i
recollected
myself
before
i
had
disclosed
the
grotesque
and
infernal
chimera
that
haunts
me
marston
paused
he
was
stooped
forward
and
looking
upon
the
floor
of
the
vehicle
so
that
his
companion
could
not
see
his
countenance
a
silence
ensued
which
was
interrupted
by
marston
who
once
more
resumed
sir
said
he
i
know
not
why
but
i
have
longed
intensely
longed
for
some
trustworthy
ear
into
which
to
pour
this
horrid
secret
why
i
repeat
i
can
not
tell
for
i
expect
no
sympathy
and
hate
compassion
it
is
i
suppose
the
restless
nature
of
the
devil
that
is
in
me
but
be
it
what
it
may
i
will
speak
to
you
but
to
you
only
for
the
present
at
least
to
you
alone
doctor
danvers
again
assured
him
that
he
might
repose
the
most
entire
confidence
in
his
secrecy
the
human
mind
i
take
it
must
have
either
comfort
in
the
past
or
hope
in
the
future
he
continued
otherwise
it
is
in
danger
to
me
sir
the
past
is
intolerably
repulsive
one
boundless
barren
and
hideous
golgotha
of
dead
hopes
and
murdered
opportunities
the
future
still
blacker
and
more
furious
peopled
with
dreadful
features
of
horror
and
menace
and
losing
itself
in
utter
darkness
sir
i
do
not
exaggerate
between
such
a
past
and
such
a
future
i
stand
upon
this
miserable
present
and
the
only
comfort
i
still
am
capable
of
feeling
is
that
no
human
being
pities
me
that
i
stand
aloof
from
the
insults
of
compassion
and
the
hypocrisies
of
sympathetic
morality
and
that
i
can
safely
defy
all
the
respectable
scoundrels
in
christendom
to
enhance
by
one
feather
weight
the
load
which
i
myself
have
accumulated
and
which
i
myself
hourly
and
unaided
sustain
doctor
danvers
here
introduced
a
word
or
two
in
the
direction
of
their
former
conversation
no
sir
there
is
no
comfort
from
that
quarter
either
said
marston
bitterly
you
but
cast
your
seeds
as
the
parable
terms
your
teaching
upon
the
barren
sea
in
wasting
them
on
me
my
fate
be
it
what
it
may
is
as
irrevocably
fixed
as
though
i
were
dead
and
judged
a
hundred
years
ago
this
cursed
dream
he
resumed
abruptly
that
everyday
enslaves
me
more
and
more
has
reference
to
that
that
occurrence
about
wynston
berkley
he
is
the
hero
of
the
hellish
illusion
at
certain
times
sir
it
seems
to
me
as
if
he
though
dead
were
still
invested
with
a
sort
of
spurious
life
going
about
unrecognized
except
by
me
in
squalor
and
contempt
and
whispering
away
my
fame
and
life
laboring
with
the
malignant
industry
of
a
fiend
to
involve
me
in
the
meshes
of
that
special
perdition
from
which
alone
i
shrink
and
to
which
this
emissary
of
hell
seems
to
have
predestined
me
sir
this
is
a
monstrous
and
hideous
extravagance
a
delusion
but
after
all
no
more
than
a
trick
of
the
imagination
the
reason
the
judgment
is
untouched
i
can
not
choose
but
see
all
the
damned
phantasmagoria
but
i
do
not
believe
it
real
and
this
is
the
difference
between
my
case
and
and
madness
they
were
now
entering
the
suburbs
of
chester
and
doctor
danvers
pained
and
shocked
beyond
measure
by
this
disclosure
and
not
knowing
what
remark
or
comfort
to
offer
relieved
his
temporary
embarrassment
by
looking
from
the
window
as
though
attracted
by
the
flash
of
the
lamps
among
which
the
vehicle
was
now
moving
marston
however
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
and
thus
recalled
him
for
a
moment
to
a
forced
attention
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
doctor
that
i
should
trust
this
cursed
secret
to
your
keeping
he
said
and
truth
to
say
it
seems
so
to
myself
i
can
not
account
for
the
impulse
the
irresistible
power
of
which
has
forced
me
to
disclose
the
hateful
mystery
to
you
but
the
fact
is
this
beginning
like
a
speck
this
one
idea
has
gradually
darkened
and
dilated
until
it
has
filled
my
entire
mind
the
solitary
consciousness
of
the
gigantic
mastery
it
has
established
there
had
grown
intolerable
i
must
have
told
it
the
sense
of
solitude
under
this
aggressive
and
tremendous
delusion
was
agony
hourly
death
to
my
soul
that
is
the
secret
of
my
talkativeness
my
sole
excuse
for
plaguing
you
with
the
dreams
of
a
wretched
hypochondriac
doctor
danvers
assured
him
that
no
apologies
were
needed
and
was
only
restrained
from
adding
the
expression
of
that
pity
which
he
really
felt
by
the
fear
of
irritating
a
temper
so
full
of
bitterness
pride
and
defiance
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
coach
having
reached
its
destination
they
bid
one
another
farewell
and
parted
at
that
time
there
resided
in
a
decent
mansion
about
a
mile
from
the
town
of
chester
a
dapper
little
gentleman
whom
we
shall
call
doctor
parkes
this
gentleman
was
the
proprietor
and
sole
professional
manager
of
a
private
asylum
for
the
insane
and
enjoyed
a
high
reputation
and
a
proportionate
amount
of
business
in
his
melancholy
calling
it
was
about
the
second
day
after
the
conversation
we
have
just
sketched
that
this
little
gentleman
having
visited
according
to
his
custom
all
his
domestic
patients
was
about
to
take
his
accustomed
walk
in
his
somewhat
restricted
pleasure
grounds
when
his
servant
announced
a
visitor
a
gentleman
he
repeated
you
have
seen
him
before
eh
no
sir
replied
the
man
he
is
in
the
study
sir
ha
a
professional
call
well
we
shall
see
so
saying
the
little
gentleman
summoned
his
gravest
look
and
hastened
to
the
chamber
of
audience
on
entering
he
found
a
man
dressed
well
but
gravely
having
in
his
air
and
manner
something
of
high
breeding
in
countenance
striking
and
stern
furrowed
with
the
lines
of
pain
or
thought
rather
than
of
age
although
his
dark
hairs
were
largely
mingled
with
white
the
physician
bowed
and
requested
the
stranger
to
take
a
chair
he
however
nodded
slightly
and
impatiently
as
if
to
intimate
an
intolerance
of
ceremony
and
advancing
a
step
or
two
said
abruptly
my
name
sir
is
marston
i
have
come
to
give
you
a
patient
the
doctor
bowed
with
a
still
deeper
inclination
and
paused
for
a
continuance
of
the
communication
thus
auspiciously
commenced
you
are
parkes
i
take
it
for
granted
said
marston
in
the
same
tone
your
most
obedient
humble
servant
sir
replied
he
with
the
polite
formality
of
the
day
and
another
grave
bow
doctor
demanded
marston
fixing
his
eye
upon
him
sternly
and
significantly
tapping
his
own
forehead
can
you
stay
execution
the
physician
looked
puzzled
hesitated
and
at
last
requested
his
visitor
to
be
more
explicit
can
you
said
marston
with
the
same
slow
and
stern
articulation
and
after
a
considerable
pause
can
you
prevent
the
malady
you
profess
to
cure
can
you
meet
and
defeat
the
enemy
halfway
can
you
scare
away
the
spirit
of
madness
before
it
takes
actual
possession
and
while
it
is
still
only
hovering
about
its
threatened
victim
sir
he
replied
in
certain
cases
in
very
many
indeed
the
enemy
as
you
well
call
it
may
thus
be
met
and
effectually
worsted
at
a
distance
timely
interposition
in
ninety
cases
out
of
a
hundred
is
everything
and
i
assure
you
i
hear
your
question
with
much
pleasure
inasmuch
as
i
assume
it
to
have
reference
to
the
case
of
the
patient
about
whom
you
desire
to
consult
me
and
who
is
therefore
i
hope
as
yet
merely
menaced
with
the
misfortune
from
which
you
would
save
him
i
myself
am
that
patient
sir
said
marston
with
an
effort
your
surmise
is
right
i
am
not
mad
but
unequivocally
menaced
with
madness
it
is
not
to
be
mistaken
sir
there
is
no
misunderstanding
the
tremendous
and
intolerable
signs
that
glare
upon
my
mind
and
pray
sir
have
you
consulted
your
friends
or
your
family
upon
the
course
best
to
be
pursued
inquired
parkes
with
grave
interest
no
sir
he
answered
sharply
and
almost
fiercely
i
have
no
fancy
to
make
myself
the
subject
of
a
writ
lunatico
i
do
want
to
lose
my
liberty
and
my
property
at
a
blow
the
course
i
mean
to
take
has
been
advised
by
no
one
but
myself
is
known
to
no
other
i
now
disclose
it
and
the
causes
of
it
to
you
a
gentleman
and
my
professional
adviser
in
the
expectation
that
you
will
guard
with
the
strictest
secrecy
my
spontaneous
revelations
this
you
promise
me
certainly
marston
i
have
neither
the
disposition
nor
the
right
to
withhold
such
a
promise
answered
the
physician
well
then
i
will
first
tell
you
the
arrangement
i
propose
with
your
permission
to
make
and
then
i
shall
answer
all
your
questions
respecting
my
own
case
resumed
marston
gloomily
i
wish
to
place
myself
under
your
care
to
live
under
your
roof
reserving
my
full
liberty
of
action
i
must
be
free
to
come
and
to
go
as
i
will
and
on
the
other
hand
i
undertake
that
you
shall
find
me
an
amenable
and
docile
patient
enough
in
addition
i
stipulate
that
there
shall
be
no
attempt
whatever
made
to
communicate
with
those
who
are
connected
with
me
these
terms
agreed
upon
i
place
myself
in
your
hands
you
will
find
in
me
as
i
said
before
a
deferential
patient
and
i
trust
not
a
troublesome
one
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
adding
that
i
shall
myself
pay
the
charge
of
my
sojourn
here
from
week
to
week
in
advance
the
proposed
arrangement
was
a
strange
one
and
although
parkes
dimly
foresaw
some
of
the
embarrassments
which
might
possibly
arise
from
his
accepting
it
there
was
yet
so
much
that
was
reasonable
as
well
as
advantageous
in
the
proposal
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
decline
it
the
preliminary
arrangement
concluded
parkes
proceeded
to
his
more
strictly
professional
investigation
it
is
of
course
needless
to
recapitulate
the
details
of
marston
tormenting
fancies
with
which
the
reader
has
indeed
been
already
sufficiently
acquainted
doctor
parkes
having
attentively
listened
to
the
narrative
and
satisfied
himself
as
to
the
physical
health
of
his
patient
was
still
sorely
puzzled
as
to
the
probable
issue
of
the
awful
struggle
already
but
too
obviously
commenced
between
the
mind
and
its
destroyer
in
the
strange
case
before
him
one
satisfactory
symptom
unquestionably
was
the
as
yet
transitory
nature
of
the
delusion
and
the
evident
and
energetic
tenacity
with
which
reason
contended
for
her
vital
ascendancy
it
was
a
case
however
which
for
many
reasons
sorely
perplexed
him
but
of
which
notwithstanding
he
was
disposed
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
the
reader
will
speedily
see
to
take
by
no
means
a
decidedly
gloomy
view
having
disburdened
his
mind
of
this
horrible
secret
marston
felt
for
a
time
a
sense
of
relief
amounting
almost
to
elation
with
far
less
of
apprehension
and
dismay
than
he
had
done
so
for
months
before
he
that
night
repaired
to
his
bedroom
there
was
nothing
in
his
case
doctor
parkes
believed
to
warrant
his
keeping
any
watch
upon
marston
actions
and
accordingly
he
bid
him
in
the
full
confidence
of
meeting
him
if
not
better
at
least
not
worse
on
the
ensuing
morning
he
miscalculated
however
marston
had
probably
himself
been
conscious
of
some
coming
crisis
in
his
hideous
malady
when
he
took
the
decisive
step
of
placing
himself
under
the
care
of
doctor
parkes
certain
it
is
that
upon
that
very
night
the
disease
broke
forth
in
a
new
and
appalling
development
doctor
parkes
whose
bedroom
was
next
to
that
occupied
by
marston
was
awakened
in
the
dead
of
night
by
a
howling
more
like
that
of
a
beast
than
a
human
voice
and
which
gradually
swelled
into
an
absolute
yell
then
came
some
horrid
laughter
and
entreaties
thick
and
frantic
then
again
the
same
unearthly
howl
the
practiced
ear
of
doctor
parkes
recognized
but
too
surely
the
terrific
import
of
those
sounds
springing
from
his
bed
and
seizing
the
candle
which
always
burned
in
his
chamber
in
anticipation
of
such
sudden
and
fearful
emergencies
he
hurried
with
a
palpitating
heart
and
spite
of
his
long
habituation
to
such
scenes
as
he
expected
with
a
certain
sense
of
horror
to
the
chamber
of
his
aristocratic
patient
late
as
it
was
marston
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
his
candle
was
still
burning
and
he
himself
half
dressed
stood
in
the
center
of
the
floor
shaking
and
livid
his
eyes
burning
with
the
preterhuman
fires
of
insanity
as
doctor
parkes
entered
the
chamber
another
shout
or
rather
yell
thundered
from
the
lips
of
this
demoniac
effigy
and
the
stood
freezing
with
horror
in
the
doorway
and
yet
exerting
what
remained
to
him
of
presence
of
mind
in
the
vain
endeavor
in
the
flaring
light
of
the
candle
to
catch
and
fix
with
his
own
practiced
eye
the
gaze
of
the
maniac
second
after
second
and
minute
after
minute
he
stood
confronting
this
frightful
slave
of
satan
in
the
momentary
expectation
that
he
would
close
with
and
destroy
him
on
a
sudden
however
this
brief
agony
of
suspense
was
terminated
a
change
like
an
awakening
consciousness
of
realities
or
rather
like
the
withdrawal
of
some
hideous
and
visible
influence
from
within
passed
over
the
tense
and
darkened
features
of
the
wretched
being
a
look
of
horrified
perplexity
doubt
and
inquiry
supervened
and
he
at
last
said
in
a
subdued
and
sullen
tone
to
doctor
parkes
who
are
you
sir
what
do
you
want
here
who
are
you
sir
i
say
who
am
i
why
your
physician
sir
doctor
parkes
sir
the
owner
of
this
house
sir
replied
he
with
all
the
sternness
he
could
command
and
yet
white
as
a
specter
with
agitation
for
shame
sir
for
shame
to
give
way
thus
what
do
you
mean
by
creating
this
causeless
alarm
and
disturbing
the
whole
household
at
so
unseasonable
an
hour
for
shame
sir
go
to
your
bed
undress
yourself
this
moment
for
shame
doctor
parkes
as
he
spoke
was
reassured
by
the
arrival
of
one
of
his
servants
alarmed
by
the
unmistakable
sounds
of
violent
frenzy
he
signed
however
to
the
man
not
to
enter
feeling
confident
as
he
did
that
the
paroxysm
had
spent
itself
aye
aye
muttered
marston
looking
almost
sheepishly
doctor
parkes
to
be
sure
what
was
i
thinking
of
how
cursedly
absurd
and
this
he
continued
glancing
at
his
sword
which
he
threw
impatiently
upon
a
sofa
as
he
spoke
folly
nonsense
a
false
alarm
as
you
say
doctor
i
beg
your
pardon
as
marston
spoke
he
proceeded
with
much
agitation
slowly
to
undress
himself
he
had
however
but
commenced
the
process
when
turning
abruptly
to
doctor
parkes
he
said
with
a
countenance
of
horror
and
in
a
whisper
by
doctor
it
has
been
upon
me
worse
than
ever
i
would
have
sworn
i
had
the
villain
with
me
for
hours
hours
sir
torturing
me
with
his
damned
sneering
threats
till
by
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
took
my
sword
oh
doctor
ca
you
save
me
can
nothing
be
done
for
me
pale
covered
with
the
dews
of
horror
he
uttered
these
last
words
in
accents
of
such
imploring
despair
as
might
have
borne
across
the
dreadful
gulf
the
prayer
of
dives
for
that
one
drop
of
water
which
never
was
to
cool
his
burning
tongue
when
rhoda
learned
that
her
father
on
leaving
gray
forest
had
fixed
no
definite
period
for
his
return
she
began
to
feel
her
situation
at
home
so
painful
and
equivocal
that
having
taken
honest
willett
to
counsel
she
came
at
last
to
the
resolution
of
accepting
the
often
conveyed
invitation
of
mervyn
and
sojourning
at
all
events
until
her
father
return
at
newton
park
my
dear
young
friend
said
the
kind
lady
as
soon
as
she
heard
little
speech
to
its
close
i
can
scarcely
describe
the
gratification
with
which
i
see
you
here
the
happiness
with
which
i
welcome
you
to
newton
park
nor
indeed
the
anxiety
with
which
i
constantly
contemplated
your
trying
and
painful
position
at
gray
forest
indeed
i
ought
to
be
angry
with
you
for
having
refused
me
this
happiness
so
long
but
you
have
made
amends
at
last
though
indeed
it
was
impossible
to
have
deferred
it
longer
you
must
not
fancy
however
that
i
will
consent
to
lose
you
so
soon
as
you
seem
to
have
intended
no
no
i
have
found
it
too
hard
to
catch
you
to
let
you
take
wing
so
easily
besides
i
have
others
to
consult
as
well
as
myself
and
persons
too
who
are
just
as
anxious
as
i
am
to
make
a
prisoner
of
you
here
the
good
mervyn
accompanied
these
words
with
looks
so
sly
and
emphasis
so
significant
that
rhoda
was
fain
to
look
down
to
hide
her
blushes
and
compassionating
the
confusion
she
herself
had
caused
the
kind
old
lady
led
her
to
the
chamber
which
was
henceforward
so
long
as
she
consented
to
remain
to
be
her
own
apartment
how
that
day
was
passed
and
how
fleetly
its
hours
sped
away
it
is
needless
to
tell
old
mervyn
had
his
gentle
as
well
as
his
grim
aspect
and
no
welcome
was
ever
more
cordial
and
tender
than
that
with
which
he
greeted
the
unprotected
child
of
his
morose
and
repulsive
neighbor
it
would
be
impossible
to
convey
any
idea
of
the
countless
assiduities
and
the
secret
delight
with
which
young
mervyn
attended
their
rambles
the
party
were
assembled
at
supper
what
a
contrast
did
this
cheerful
happy
unutterably
happy
gathering
present
in
the
mind
of
rhoda
to
the
dull
drear
fearful
evenings
which
she
had
long
been
wont
to
pass
at
gray
forest
as
they
sate
together
in
cheerful
and
happy
intercourse
a
chaise
drove
up
to
the
and
the
knocking
had
hardly
ceased
to
reverberate
when
a
voice
was
heard
in
the
hall
young
mervyn
started
to
his
feet
and
merrily
ejaculating
charles
marston
this
is
delightful
disappeared
and
in
an
instant
returned
with
charles
himself
we
pass
over
all
the
embraces
of
brother
and
sister
the
tears
and
smiles
of
affection
we
omit
the
cordial
shaking
of
hands
the
kind
looks
the
questions
and
answers
all
these
and
all
the
little
attentions
of
that
good
hospitality
which
was
never
weary
of
demonstrating
the
cordiality
of
its
welcome
we
abandon
to
the
imagination
of
the
reader
charles
marston
with
the
advice
of
his
friend
mervyn
resolved
to
lose
no
time
in
proceeding
to
chester
whither
it
was
ascertained
his
father
had
gone
with
the
declared
intention
of
meeting
and
accompanying
him
home
he
arrived
in
that
town
in
the
evening
and
having
previously
learned
that
doctor
danvers
had
been
for
some
time
in
chester
he
at
once
sought
him
at
his
usual
lodgings
and
found
the
worthy
old
gentleman
at
his
solitary
dish
of
tea
my
dear
charles
said
he
greeting
his
young
friend
with
earnest
warmth
i
am
rejoiced
beyond
measure
to
see
you
your
father
is
in
town
as
you
supposed
and
i
have
just
had
a
note
from
him
which
has
i
confess
not
a
little
agitated
me
referring
as
it
does
to
a
subject
of
painful
and
horrible
interest
one
with
which
i
suppose
you
are
familiar
but
upon
which
i
myself
have
never
yet
spoken
fully
to
any
person
excepting
your
father
only
and
pray
my
dear
sir
what
is
this
topic
inquired
charles
with
marked
interest
read
this
note
answered
the
clergyman
placing
one
at
the
same
time
in
his
young
visitor
hand
charles
read
as
follows
my
dear
sir
i
have
a
singular
communication
to
make
to
you
but
in
the
strictest
privacy
with
reference
to
a
subject
which
merely
to
name
is
to
awaken
feelings
of
doubt
and
horror
i
mean
the
confession
of
merton
with
respect
to
the
murder
of
wynston
berkley
i
will
call
upon
you
this
evening
after
dark
for
i
have
certain
reasons
for
not
caring
to
meet
old
acquaintances
about
town
and
if
you
can
afford
me
half
an
hour
i
promise
to
complete
my
intended
disclosure
within
that
time
let
us
be
strictly
private
this
is
my
only
proviso
yours
with
much
respect
richard
marston
your
father
has
been
sorely
troubled
in
mind
said
doctor
danvers
as
soon
as
the
young
man
had
read
this
communication
he
has
told
me
as
much
it
may
be
that
the
discovery
he
has
now
made
may
possibly
have
relieved
him
from
certain
galling
anxieties
the
fear
that
unjust
suspicion
should
light
upon
himself
or
those
connected
with
him
has
i
dare
say
tormented
him
sorely
god
grant
that
as
the
providential
unfolding
of
all
the
details
of
this
mysterious
crime
comes
about
he
maybe
brought
to
recognize
in
the
just
and
terrible
process
the
hand
of
heaven
god
grant
that
at
last
his
heart
may
be
softened
and
his
spirit
illuminated
by
the
blessed
influence
he
has
so
long
and
so
sternly
rejected
as
the
old
man
thus
spake
as
if
in
symbolic
answering
to
his
prayer
a
sudden
glory
from
the
setting
sun
streamed
through
the
funereal
pile
of
clouds
which
filled
the
western
horizon
and
flooded
the
chamber
where
they
were
after
a
silence
charles
marston
said
with
some
little
embarrassment
it
may
be
a
strange
confession
to
make
though
indeed
hardly
so
to
you
for
you
know
but
too
well
the
gloomy
reserve
with
which
my
father
has
uniformly
treated
me
that
the
exact
nature
of
confession
never
reached
my
ears
and
once
or
twice
when
i
approached
the
subject
in
conversation
with
you
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
subject
was
one
which
for
some
reason
it
was
painful
to
you
to
enter
upon
and
so
it
was
in
truth
my
young
friend
so
it
was
for
that
confession
left
behind
it
many
fearful
doubts
proving
indeed
nothing
but
the
one
fact
that
morally
the
wretched
man
was
guilty
of
the
murder
charles
urged
by
a
feeling
of
the
keenest
interest
requested
danvers
to
detail
to
him
the
particulars
of
the
dying
man
narration
willingly
answered
danvers
with
a
look
of
gloom
and
heaving
a
profound
sigh
willingly
for
you
have
now
come
to
an
age
when
you
may
safely
be
entrusted
with
secrets
affecting
your
own
family
and
which
although
thank
god
as
i
believe
they
in
no
respect
involve
the
honor
of
anyone
of
its
members
yet
might
deeply
involve
its
peace
and
its
security
against
the
assaults
of
vague
and
horrible
slander
here
then
is
the
narrative
merton
when
he
was
conscious
of
the
approach
of
death
qualified
by
a
circumstantial
and
detailed
statement
the
absolute
confession
of
guilt
which
he
had
at
first
sullenly
made
in
this
he
declared
that
the
guilt
of
design
and
intention
only
was
his
that
in
the
act
itself
he
had
been
anticipated
he
stated
that
from
the
moment
when
sir
wynston
servant
had
casually
mentioned
the
circumstance
of
his
master
usually
sleeping
with
his
watch
and
pocketbook
under
his
pillow
the
idea
of
robbing
him
had
taken
possession
of
his
mind
with
the
idea
of
robbing
him
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
his
servant
sleeping
in
the
apartment
close
by
and
the
slightest
alarm
being
in
all
probability
sufficient
to
call
him
to
the
spot
the
idea
of
anticipating
resistance
by
murder
had
associated
itself
he
had
contended
against
these
haunting
and
growing
solicitations
of
satan
with
an
earnest
agony
he
had
intended
to
leave
his
place
and
fly
from
the
mysterious
temptation
which
he
felt
he
wanted
power
to
combat
but
accident
or
fate
prevented
him
in
a
state
of
ghastly
excitement
he
had
on
the
memorable
night
of
sir
wynston
murder
proceeded
as
had
afterwards
appeared
in
evidence
by
the
back
stair
to
the
baronet
chamber
he
had
softly
stolen
into
it
and
gone
to
the
bedside
with
the
weapon
in
his
hand
he
drew
his
breath
for
the
decisive
stroke
which
was
to
bereave
the
supposedly
sleeping
man
of
life
and
when
stretching
his
left
hand
under
the
clothes
it
rested
upon
a
dull
cold
corpse
and
at
the
same
moment
his
right
hand
was
immersed
in
a
pool
of
blood
he
dropped
the
knife
recoiled
a
pace
or
so
with
a
painful
effort
however
he
again
grasped
with
his
hand
to
recover
the
weapon
he
had
suffered
to
escape
and
secured
as
it
afterwards
turned
out
not
the
knife
with
which
he
had
meditated
the
commission
of
his
crime
but
the
dagger
which
was
afterwards
found
where
he
had
concealed
it
he
was
now
fully
alive
to
the
horror
of
his
situation
he
was
compromised
as
fully
as
if
he
had
in
very
deed
driven
home
the
weapon
to
be
found
under
such
circumstances
would
convict
him
as
surely
as
if
fifty
eyes
had
seen
him
strike
the
blow
he
had
nothing
now
for
it
but
flight
and
in
order
to
guard
himself
against
the
contingency
of
being
surprised
from
the
door
opening
upon
the
corridor
he
bolted
it
then
groped
under
the
murdered
man
pillow
for
the
booty
which
had
so
fatally
fascinated
his
imagination
here
he
was
disappointed
what
further
happened
you
already
know
charles
listened
with
breathless
attention
to
this
recital
and
after
a
painful
interval
said
then
the
actual
murderer
is
after
all
unascertained
this
is
indeed
horrible
it
was
very
natural
that
my
father
should
have
felt
the
danger
to
which
such
a
disclosure
would
have
exposed
the
reputation
of
our
family
yet
i
should
have
preferred
encountering
it
were
it
ten
times
as
great
to
the
equivocal
prudence
of
suppressing
the
truth
with
respect
to
a
murder
committed
under
my
own
roof
he
has
however
it
would
seem
arrived
at
some
new
conclusions
said
danvers
and
is
now
prepared
to
throw
some
unanticipated
light
upon
the
whole
transaction
even
as
they
were
talking
a
knocking
was
heard
at
the
and
after
a
brief
and
hurried
consultation
it
was
agreed
that
considering
the
strict
condition
of
privacy
attached
to
this
visit
by
marston
himself
as
well
as
his
reserved
and
wayward
temper
it
might
be
better
for
charles
to
avoid
presenting
himself
to
his
father
on
this
occasion
a
few
seconds
afterwards
the
door
opened
and
marston
entered
the
apartment
it
was
now
dark
and
the
servant
unbidden
placed
candles
upon
the
table
without
answering
one
word
to
danvers
greeting
marston
sat
down
as
it
seemed
in
agitated
abstraction
removing
his
hat
suddenly
for
he
had
not
even
made
this
slight
homage
to
the
laws
of
courtesy
he
looked
round
with
a
fiery
eye
and
a
pale
countenance
and
said
we
are
quite
alone
danvers
no
one
anywhere
near
danvers
assured
him
that
all
was
secure
after
a
long
and
agitated
pause
marston
said
you
remember
merton
confession
he
admitted
his
intention
to
kill
berkley
but
denied
that
he
was
the
actual
murderer
he
spoke
truth
no
one
knew
it
better
than
i
for
i
am
the
murderer
danvers
was
so
shocked
and
overwhelmed
that
he
was
utterly
unable
to
speak
aye
sir
in
point
of
law
and
of
morals
literally
and
honestly
the
murderer
of
wynston
berkley
i
am
resolved
you
shall
know
it
all
make
what
use
of
it
you
will
i
care
for
nothing
now
but
to
get
rid
of
the
d
d
unsustainable
secret
and
that
is
done
i
did
not
intend
to
kill
the
scoundrel
when
i
went
to
his
room
but
with
the
just
feelings
of
exasperation
with
which
i
regarded
him
it
would
have
been
wiser
had
i
avoided
the
interview
and
i
meant
to
have
done
so
but
his
candle
was
burning
i
saw
the
light
through
the
door
and
went
in
it
was
his
evil
fortune
to
indulge
in
his
old
strain
of
sardonic
impertinence
he
provoked
me
i
struck
him
he
struck
me
again
and
with
his
own
dagger
i
stabbed
him
three
times
i
did
not
know
what
i
had
done
i
could
not
believe
it
i
felt
neither
remorse
nor
sorrow
why
should
i
but
the
thing
was
horrible
astounding
there
he
sat
in
the
corner
of
his
cushioned
chair
with
the
old
fiendish
smile
on
still
sir
i
never
thought
that
any
human
shape
could
look
so
dreadful
i
do
know
how
long
i
stayed
there
freezing
with
horror
and
detestation
and
yet
unable
to
take
my
eyes
from
the
face
did
you
see
it
in
the
coffin
sir
there
was
a
sneer
of
triumph
on
it
that
was
diabolic
and
prophetic
marston
was
fearfully
agitated
as
he
spoke
and
repeatedly
wiped
from
his
face
the
cold
sweat
that
gathered
there
i
could
not
leave
the
room
by
the
back
stairs
he
resumed
for
the
valet
slept
in
the
intervening
chamber
i
felt
such
an
appalled
antipathy
to
the
body
that
i
could
scarcely
muster
courage
to
pass
it
but
sir
i
am
not
easily
cowed
i
mastered
this
repugnance
in
a
few
minutes
or
rather
i
acted
spite
of
it
i
knew
not
how
but
instinctively
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
better
to
lay
the
body
in
the
bed
than
leave
it
where
it
was
shewing
as
its
position
might
that
the
thing
occurred
in
an
altercation
so
sir
i
raised
it
and
bore
it
softly
across
the
room
and
laid
it
in
the
bed
and
while
i
was
carrying
it
it
swayed
forward
the
arms
glided
round
my
neck
and
the
head
rested
against
my
cheek
that
was
a
parody
upon
a
brotherly
embrace
i
do
not
know
at
what
moment
it
was
but
some
time
when
i
was
carrying
wynston
or
laying
him
in
the
bed
continued
marston
who
spoke
rather
like
one
pursuing
a
horrible
reverie
than
as
a
man
relating
facts
to
a
listener
i
heard
a
light
tread
and
soft
breathing
in
the
lobby
a
thunderclap
would
have
stunned
me
less
that
minute
i
moved
softly
holding
my
breath
to
the
door
i
believe
in
moments
of
strong
excitement
men
hear
more
acutely
than
at
other
times
but
i
thought
i
heard
the
rustling
of
a
gown
going
from
the
door
again
i
waited
it
ceased
i
waited
until
all
was
quiet
i
then
extinguished
the
candle
and
groped
my
way
to
the
door
there
was
a
faint
light
in
the
corridor
and
i
thought
i
saw
a
head
projected
from
the
next
to
the
frenchwoman
mademoiselle
as
i
came
on
it
was
softly
withdrawn
and
the
door
not
quite
noiselessly
closed
i
could
not
be
absolutely
certain
but
i
learned
all
afterward
and
now
sir
you
have
the
story
of
sir
wynston
murder
danvers
groaned
in
spirit
being
wrung
alike
with
fear
and
sorrow
with
hands
clasped
and
head
bowed
down
in
an
exceeding
bitter
agony
of
soul
he
murmured
only
the
words
of
the
litany
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
christ
have
mercy
upon
us
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
marston
had
recovered
his
usual
lowering
aspect
and
gloomy
in
a
few
moments
and
was
now
standing
erect
and
defiant
before
the
humbled
and
afflicted
minister
of
god
the
contrast
was
terrible
almost
sublime
doctor
danvers
resolved
to
keep
this
dreadful
secret
at
least
for
a
time
to
himself
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
inflict
upon
those
whom
he
loved
so
well
as
charles
and
rhoda
the
shame
and
agony
of
such
a
disclosure
yet
he
was
sorely
troubled
for
his
was
a
conflict
of
duty
and
mercy
of
love
and
justice
he
told
charles
marston
when
urged
with
earnest
inquiry
that
what
he
had
heard
that
evening
was
intended
solely
for
his
own
ear
and
gently
but
peremptorily
declined
telling
at
least
until
some
future
time
the
substance
of
his
father
communication
charles
now
felt
it
necessary
to
see
his
father
for
the
purpose
of
letting
him
know
the
substance
of
the
letter
respecting
mademoiselle
and
the
late
sir
wynston
which
had
reached
him
accordingly
he
proceeded
accompanied
by
doctor
danvers
on
the
next
morning
to
the
hotel
where
marston
had
intimated
his
intention
of
passing
the
night
on
their
inquiring
for
him
in
the
hall
the
porter
appeared
much
perplexed
and
disturbed
and
as
they
pressed
him
with
questions
his
answers
became
conflicting
and
mysterious
marston
was
there
he
had
slept
there
last
night
he
could
not
say
whether
or
not
he
was
then
in
the
house
but
he
knew
that
no
one
could
be
admitted
to
see
him
he
would
if
the
gentlemen
wished
it
send
their
cards
to
not
marston
but
the
proprietor
and
finally
he
concluded
by
begging
that
they
would
themselves
see
the
proprietor
and
dispatched
a
waiter
to
apprise
him
of
the
circumstances
of
the
visit
there
was
something
odd
and
even
sinister
in
all
this
which
along
with
the
whispering
and
the
curious
glances
of
the
waiters
who
happened
to
hear
the
errand
on
which
they
came
inspired
the
two
companions
with
vague
misgivings
which
they
did
not
care
mutually
to
disclose
in
a
few
moments
they
were
shown
into
a
small
sitting
room
up
stairs
where
the
proprietor
a
fussy
little
gentleman
and
apparently
very
uneasy
and
frightened
received
them
we
have
called
here
to
see
marston
said
doctor
danvers
and
the
porter
has
referred
us
to
you
yes
sir
exactly
precisely
so
answered
the
little
man
fidgeting
excessively
and
as
it
seemed
growing
paler
every
instant
but
but
in
fact
sir
there
is
there
has
been
in
short
have
you
not
heard
of
the
the
accident
he
wound
up
with
a
prodigious
effort
and
wiped
his
forehead
when
he
had
done
pray
sir
be
explicit
we
are
near
friends
of
marston
in
fact
sir
this
is
his
son
said
doctor
danvers
pointing
to
charles
marston
and
we
are
both
uneasy
at
the
reserve
with
which
our
inquiries
have
been
met
do
i
entreat
of
you
say
what
has
happened
why
why
hesitated
the
man
i
really
i
would
not
for
five
hundred
pounds
it
had
happened
in
my
house
the
the
unhappy
gentleman
has
in
short
he
glanced
at
charles
as
if
afraid
of
the
effect
of
the
disclosure
he
was
on
the
point
of
making
and
then
hurriedly
said
he
is
dead
sir
he
was
found
dead
in
his
room
this
morning
at
eight
i
assure
you
i
have
not
been
myself
ever
since
charles
marston
was
so
stunned
by
this
sudden
blow
that
he
was
upon
the
point
of
fainting
rallying
however
with
a
strong
effort
he
demanded
to
be
conducted
to
the
chamber
where
the
body
lay
the
man
assented
but
hesitated
on
reaching
the
door
and
whispered
something
in
the
ear
of
doctor
danvers
who
as
he
heard
it
raised
his
hands
and
eyes
with
a
mute
expression
of
horror
and
turning
to
charles
said
my
dear
young
friend
remain
where
you
are
for
a
few
moments
i
will
return
to
you
immediately
and
tell
you
whatever
i
have
ascertained
you
are
in
no
condition
for
such
a
scene
at
present
charles
indeed
felt
that
the
fact
was
so
and
sick
and
giddy
suffered
doctor
danvers
with
gentle
compulsion
to
force
him
into
a
seat
in
silence
the
venerable
clergyman
followed
his
conductor
with
a
palpitating
heart
he
advanced
to
the
bedside
and
twice
essayed
to
draw
the
curtain
and
twice
lost
courage
but
gathering
resolution
at
last
he
pulled
the
drapery
aside
and
beheld
all
he
was
to
see
again
of
richard
marston
the
bedclothes
were
drawn
so
as
nearly
to
cover
the
mouth
there
is
the
wound
sir
whispered
the
man
as
with
coarse
officiousness
he
drew
back
the
bedclothes
from
the
throat
of
the
corpse
and
exhibited
a
gash
as
it
seemed
nearly
severing
the
head
from
the
body
with
sickening
horror
doctor
danvers
turned
away
from
the
awful
spectacle
he
covered
his
face
in
his
hands
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
soft
solemn
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
the
mystic
words
whoso
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
the
hand
which
but
a
few
years
before
had
unsuspected
consigned
a
to
the
grave
had
itself
avenged
the
murder
marston
had
perished
by
his
own
hand
naturally
ambitious
and
intriguing
the
perilous
tendencies
of
such
a
spirit
in
mademoiselle
de
barras
had
never
been
schooled
by
the
mighty
and
benignant
principles
of
religion
of
her
accidental
acquaintance
at
rouen
with
sir
wynston
berkley
and
her
subsequent
introduction
in
an
evil
hour
into
the
family
at
gray
forest
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
the
unhappy
terms
on
which
she
found
marston
living
with
his
wife
suggested
in
their
mutual
alienation
the
idea
of
founding
a
double
influence
in
the
household
and
to
conceive
the
idea
and
to
act
upon
it
were
in
her
active
mind
the
same
young
beautiful
fascinating
she
well
knew
the
power
of
her
attractions
and
determined
though
probably
without
one
thought
of
transgressing
the
limits
of
literal
propriety
to
bring
them
to
bear
upon
the
discontented
retired
roué
for
whom
she
cared
absolutely
nothing
except
as
the
instrument
and
in
part
the
victim
of
her
schemes
thus
yielding
to
the
double
instinct
that
swayed
her
she
gratified
at
the
same
time
her
love
of
intrigue
and
her
love
of
power
at
length
however
came
the
hour
which
demanded
a
sacrifice
to
the
evil
influence
she
had
hitherto
worshipped
on
such
easy
terms
she
found
that
her
power
must
now
be
secured
by
crime
and
she
fell
then
came
the
arrival
of
sir
wynston
his
murder
her
elopement
with
marston
and
her
guilty
and
joyless
triumph
at
last
however
came
the
blow
long
suspended
and
terrific
which
shattered
all
her
hopes
and
schemes
and
drove
her
once
again
upon
the
world
the
catastrophe
we
have
just
described
after
it
she
made
her
way
to
paris
arrived
in
the
capital
of
france
she
speedily
dissipated
whatever
remained
of
the
money
and
valuables
which
she
had
taken
with
her
from
gray
forest
and
madame
marston
as
she
now
styled
herself
was
glad
to
place
herself
once
more
as
a
governess
in
an
aristocratic
family
so
far
her
good
fortune
had
prevailed
in
averting
the
punishment
but
too
well
earned
by
her
past
life
but
a
day
of
reckoning
was
to
come
a
few
years
later
france
was
involved
in
the
uproar
and
conflagration
of
revolution
noble
families
were
scattered
beggared
decimated
and
their
dependants
often
dragged
along
with
them
into
the
flaming
abyss
in
many
instances
suffered
the
last
dire
extremities
of
human
ill
it
was
at
this
awful
period
that
a
retribution
so
frightful
and
extraordinary
overtook
madame
marston
that
we
may
hereafter
venture
to
make
it
the
subject
of
a
separate
narrative
until
then
the
reader
will
rest
satisfied
with

long
and
as
it
may
possibly
turn
out
an
eternal
farewell
to
that
beautiful
embodiment
of
an
evil
and
disastrous
influence
the
concluding
chapter
in
a
novel
is
always
brief
though
seldom
so
short
as
the
world
would
have
it
in
a
tale
like
this
the
winding
up
must
be
proportionately
contracted
we
have
scarcely
a
claim
to
so
many
lines
as
the
formal
novelist
may
occupy
pages
in
the
distribution
of
poetic
justice
and
the
final
grouping
of
his
characters
into
that
effective
tableau
upon
which
at
last
the
curtain
gracefully
descends
we
too
may
be
all
the
briefer
inasmuch
as
the
reader
has
doubtless
anticipated
the
little
we
have
to
say
it
amounts
then
to
this
within
two
years
after
the
fearful
event
which
we
have
just
recorded
an
alliance
had
drawn
together
in
nearer
and
dearer
union
the
inmates
of
gray

newton

rhoda

given
her
hand
to
young
mervyn

ulterior
consequences
we
say
nothing
the
nursery
is
above
our
province
and
now
at
length
after
this
christmas
journey
through
somewhat
stern
and
gloomy
scenery
in
this
flood
of
golden
sunshine
we
bid
thee
gentle
reader
a
fond
farewell
