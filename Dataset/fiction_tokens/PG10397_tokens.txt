monsieur
please
it
was
my
great
good
fortune
said
the
stranger
bowing
to
be
of
service
to
a
compatriot
oh
she
cried
with
a
little
start
there
he
is
now
almost
near
enough
to
hear
what
is
it
she
demanded

you

archibald
rushford
tall
lean
the
embodiment
of
energy
stood
at
the
window
hands
in
pockets
and
stared
disgustedly
out
at
the
dreary
vista
of
and
closed
in
the
distance
by
a
stretch
of
gray
sea
mounting
toward
a
horizon
scarcely
discernible
through
the
drifting
mist
which
hung
above
the
water
though
why
you
wanted
to
come
here
at
all
he
continued
presumably
addressing
two
young
ladies
in
the
room
behind
him
or
why
you
want
to
stay
now
you
here
passes
my
comprehension
one
might
as
well
be
buried
alive
and
be
done
with
it
the
sensations
i
should
imagine
are
about
the
same
oh
come
dad
protested
one
of
the
girls
laughing
you
know
it
is
so
bad
as
that
there
plenty
of
life
not
just
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
perhaps
with
a
fleeting
glance
at
the
empty
landscape
but
the
hour
is
unfashionable
as
everything
seasonable
and
sensible
seems
to
be
here
put
in
her
father
grimly
and
such
interesting
life
too
added
the
other
girl
interesting
bah
when
i
want
to
see
monkeys
and
peacocks
i
go
to
a
menagerie
but
you
never
do
go
to
the
menagerie
at
home
you
know
dad
no
because
i
do
care
for
monkeys
or
peacocks
in
fact
i
particularly
detest
them
but
lions
dad
there
are
lions
in
the
menagerie
at
home
perhaps
yes
and
in
this
one
bigger
lions
than
you
ever
dreamed
of
dad
perfect
monsters
of
lions
oh
no
there
are
susie
dissented
rushford
you
do
know
the
species
you
mistaken
a
bray
for
a
roar
just
as
a
lot
of
people
always
do
if
the
bray
is
only
loud
enough
come
now
let
me
know
the
worst
how
much
longer
do
you
propose
to
stay
here
well
dad
you
see
the
season
wo
be
at
its
height
for
fully
a
month
yet
a
month
echoed
rushford
in
dismay
well
susie
you
and
nell
may
be
able
to
stand
it
for
a
month
but
long
ere
that
i
be
dead
ossified
fossilised
dried
up
and
blown
away
maybe
you
girls
enjoy
it
though
i
did
think
it
of
you
but
what
can
do
i
tired
of
reading
newspaper
and
of
being
two
days
behind
the
market
two
days
think
what
may
have
happened
to
steel
since
heard
from
it
it
enough
to
drive
a
man
mad
he
got
out
a
cigar
lighted
it
and
stood
puffing
it
nervously
appalled
at
the
vision
his
own
words
had
conjured
up
but
dad
sue
pointed
out
coming
to
his
side
and
taking
his
arm
coaxingly
you
know
it
was
just
to
get
away
from
all
that
worry
from
those
horrid
stocks
and
things
that
you
consented
to
come
with
us
do
call
the
stocks
hard
names
susie
do
go
back
on
your
best
friends
protested
rushford
do
forget
what
they
done
for
you
but
dear
you
remember
how
strongly
doctor
samuels
insisted
on
your
taking
a
rest
how
necessary
he
said
it
was
oh
perfectly
responded
rushford
drily
i
suspected
right
along
that
samuels
took
his
orders
from
you
from
me
dad
cried
sue
indignantly
but
her
eyes
were
shining
in
a
most
suspicious
manner
a
man
of
his
standing
it
does
matter
broke
in
her
father
with
a
wave
of
his
arm
willing
to
grant
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
samuels
was
perfectly
sincere
but
i
still
protest
that
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
conceal
ourselves
here
we
have
done
anything
the
police
after
us
i
can
speak
for
myself
at
least
this
seemed
to
be
such
a
nice
quiet
place
for
you
dad
explained
nell
perching
herself
upon
a
table
near
the
window
and
gazing
pensively
out
at
the
shimmering
water
which
told
that
the
sun
was
winning
a
decisive
victory
over
the
mist
and
that
the
day
would
be
a
fine
one
for
me
repeated
her
father
turning
and
staring
at
her
you
mean
to
say
you
chose
this
place
on
account
nell
nodded
but
she
winked
at
susie
and
then
you
know
she
added
we
have
always
wanted
to
get
a
glimpse
of
a
real
dutch
i
do
believe
this
a
real
dutch
nobody
here
speaks
anything
but
french
why
it
even
got
a
french
name
only
french
dad
sue
corrected
and
everything
is
priced
in
francs
that
is
true
of
all
europe
asserted
nell
with
superb
aplomb
well
dutch
french
or
hindoo
you
had
your
glimpse
have
you
suppose
we
move
on
and
get
a
glimpse
or
two
of
something
worth
seeing
oh
but
we
seen
it
all
only
from
the
outside
we
been
like
the
audience
at
a
show
we
have
had
any
part
in
it
and
it
so
much
more
interesting
behind
the
scenes
it
dull
enough
from
in
front
heaven
knows
agreed
rushford
if
i
had
my
way
i
ring
down
the
curtain
and
close
the
show
up
this
minute
it
the
worst
i
ever
saw
and
i
very
much
doubt
if
a
respectable
american
family
has
any
business
behind
the
scenes
you
jaundiced
dad
laughed
sue
you
looking
at
the
place
through
a
yellow
film
of
prejudice
one
must
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
rushford
groaned
i
afraid
i
too
set
in
my
ways
susie
he
said
dismally
lived
in
america
too
long
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
dance
the
and
be
done
with
it
besides
continued
sue
it
just
as
nell
says
we
on
the
outside
we
have
got
a
foothold
there
something
the
matter
maybe
they
think
i
that
chicago
cashier
who
got
away
with
a
million
not
long
ago
on
second
thought
though
i
do
believe
that
would
make
any
difference
that
fellow
would
find
a
very
congenial
circle
here
he
would
have
any
difficulty
in
getting
behind
the
scenes
sue
and
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
said
nell
and
we
concluded
that
it
must
be
something
about
the
hotel
we
seem
to
have
picked
out
the
wrong
one
the
place
empty
and
that
a
fact
agreed
rushford
it
unnaturally
so
said
sue
something
the
matter
with
it
taboo
for
some
reason
well
it
good
enough
for
me
remarked
her
father
after
all
there
is
much
difference
in
prisons
but
i
want
to
repeat
as
emphatically
as
possible
that
i
ca
keep
on
loafing
here
for
a
month
and
preserve
my
sanity
do
you
see
how
much
whiter
my
hair
getting
i
willing
to
do
anything
in
reason
to
oblige
you
and
i
fully
realise
the
importance
of
your
sociological
and
ethnological
studies
sue
hand
on
his
mouth
stopped
him
take
a
breath
dad
she
cautioned
him
take
a
breath
those
were
mighty
long
words
as
i
was
about
to
remark
continued
rushford
calmly
taking
the
hand
away
i
am
of
course
a
doting
parent
who
would
not
be
with
two
such
children
but
candidly
i
do
just
see
where
i
come
in
i
tell
you
girls
i
got
to
have
some
excitement
there
plenty
of
excitement
at
the
casino
dad
oh
yes
faro
excitement
roulette
excitement
i
never
cared
for
that
kind
i
always
had
the
sense
to
keep
out
of
games
even
on
wall
street
but
the
people
the
people
french
apes
in
fancy
waistcoats
dutch
dandies
in
corsets
women
with
painted
cheeks
and
pencilled
eyebrows
whom
you
ashamed
to
look
at
some
of
them
are
respectable
dad
laughed
sue
one
would
never
suspect
it
oh
yes
dad
some
of
them
belong
to
the
nobility
that
no
certificate
of
character
rather
the
reverse
if
one
may
believe
the
papers
gossip
dad
nothing
but
gossip
and
you
know
how
you
always
hated
gossip
you
told
us
never
to
believe
it
it
may
be
but
one
could
believe
anything
of
most
of
the
women
one
sees
around
here
my
only
chance
for
amusement
is
to
get
up
a
flirtation
with
some
of
them
i
do
think
it
would
be
difficult
they
do
seem
a
bit
shy
only
he
added
with
a
sigh
i
getting
too
old
yes
dad
i
afraid
you
are
agreed
susie
you
would
really
enjoy
it
days
are
in
the
yellow
leaf
the
flowers
and
fruits
of
love
are
gone
the
worm
the
canker
and
the
grief
are
mine
alone
quoted
nell
in
a
solemn
voice
do
you
be
too
sure
retorted
her
father
threateningly
wheeling
around
upon
her
there
no
telling
what
i
may
be
driven
to
if
kept
imprisoned
here
much
longer
i
look
old
i
am
strong
and
lusty
finished
sue
of
course
you
are
dad
and
you
do
look
old
either
why
gazing
up
at
him
critically
you
do
look
a
day
over
forty
do
try
to
bamboozle
your
pa
susie
laughed
rushford
i
can
see
through
you
you
be
trying
to
make
me
believe
next
that
you
want
a
stepmother
i
would
if
it
would
make
you
any
happier
dad
her
father
gazed
down
for
an
instant
into
her
face
then
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
squeezed
her
what
you
up
to
he
demanded
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
your
old
dad
why
susie
own
up
you
scratch
out
the
eyes
of
the
best
woman
in
the
world
if
she
dared
to
look
twice
at
me
of
course
i
would
admitted
susie
instantly
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
dad
that
even
the
best
woman
in
the
world
is
good
enough
for
you
let
go
across
to
the
other
hotel
dad
suggested
nell
with
a
nonchalance
intended
to
conceal
the
fact
that
this
was
the
point
she
and
susie
had
been
aiming
at
from
the
very
first
her
father
released
susie
and
stared
at
his
other
daughter
in
amazement
what
on
earth
for
he
demanded
oh
everybody
seems
to
be
over
there
you
noticed
yes
i
noticed
that
it
running
over
with
the
and
of
all
europe
if
you
think
i
butt
into
that
bedlam
my
dear
child
you
badly
mistaken
i
rather
live
with
the
freaks
in
a
museum
but
it
so
quiet
here
i
glad
of
it
besides
i
thought
you
wanted
quiet
only
for
your
sake
do
you
see
we
trying
our
best
to
please
you
a
moment
ago
you
said
you
wanted
excitement
i
do
but
it
must
be
excitement
with
an
object
i
have
got
any
use
for
the
infernal
purposeless
chattering
i
hear
all
around
me
every
time
i
go
out
on
the
dyke
damn
a
man
anyhow
who
ca
find
anything
better
to
do
than
to
run
around
to
and
flirt
with
other
wives
i
tell
you
girls
i
want
to
get
back
to
new
york
give
us
another
month
dad
pleaded
sue
catching
his
arm
again
as
he
stamped
up
and
down
you
know
that
you
promised
to
stay
with
us
two
months
at
the
very
least
we
ca
go
around
without
a
chaperon
her
father
face
relaxed
as
he
looked
down
at
her
and
he
smiled
grimly
so
we
get
down
to
the
real
reason
at
last
do
we
he
queried
i
thought
all
this
solicitude
for
my
health
was
a
trifle
unnatural
useful
as
a
chaperon
am
i
see
here
girls
i
can
put
in
my
time
more
profitably
at
the
stock
exchange
and
have
a
heap
more
fun
i
hire
a
chaperon
for
you
or
half
a
dozen
if
you
want
them
and
pull
out
for
new
york
what
do
you
say
i
do
know
the
first
principles
of
the
business
anyway
oh
yes
you
do
dad
protested
susie
you
a
perfectly
ideal
chaperon
i
am
the
ideal
chaperon
then
must
be
one
who
never
does
any
chaperoning
that
it
exactly
cried
nell
clapping
her
hands
delightedly
how
quickly
you
see
things
dad
so
that
it
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
darkly
at
his
offspring
well
you
girls
are
old
enough
to
take
care
of
yourselves
if
you
ca
it
high
time
you
were
learning
how
oh
we
perfectly
able
to
take
care
of
ourselves
sue
assured
him
you
must
worry
about
us
for
a
moment
dad
i
not
likely
to
but
in
that
case
why
do
you
want
me
along
at
all
why
do
you
see
dad
it
you
who
give
us
the
odour
of
respectability
by
ourselves
we
should
be
social
outcasts
impossible
not
to
be
spoken
to
except
by
men
it
is
convenable
oh
i
see
said
rushford
the
first
great
principle
of
european
society
seems
to
be
the
worst
of
every
one
not
precisely
dad
but
no
unmarried
woman
may
venture
outside
the
circumference
of
the
family
circle
that
the
great
european
convention
the
basic
principle
of
her
social
order
a
sort
of
you
it
game
is
it
the
family
circle
is
a
kind
of
dead
line
the
ring
of
fire
which
keeps
out
the
wild
beasts
step
over
and
you
lost
of
course
said
nell
it
is
only
to
unmarried
women
that
the
rule
applies
oh
certainly
assented
her
father
married
women
are
allowed
more
latitude
in
fact
from
such
french
novels
as
i
read
i
should
infer
that
they
usually
swing
clear
around
the
circle
it
a
reaction
i
suppose
a
sort
of
compensation
for
the
privations
of
their
youth
i
do
like
it
let
go
home
but
your
promise
dad
pleaded
sue
permitting
the
faintest
suspicion
of
moisture
to
appear
in
her
dark
eyes
and
you
know
you
really
do
need
a
vacation
her
father
looked
down
at
her
saw
the
moisture
and
surrendered
you
a
humbug
he
said
and
this
vacation
business
is
another
a
man
spends
two
or
three
months
loafing
around
because
somebody
tells
him
he
looking
badly
and
ought
to
take
a
rest
and
before
he
knows
it
he
accumulated
so
much
rust
in
his
system
that
he
never
gets
it
all
out
again
his
machinery
creaks
more
or
less
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
wise
man
postpones
his
vacation
to
the
next
world
well
let
call
it
a
jaunt
suggested
susie
a
jaunt
somehow
implies
hurry
and
bustle
with
plenty
of
exercise
and
i
do
know
which
is
the
bigger
fool
pursued
her
father
not
heeding
her
the
fellow
who
takes
a
vacation
every
year
on
his
own
hook
or
the
one
who
permits
his
daughters
to
drag
him
away
from
his
comfortable
home
and
his
morning
paper
and
the
business
which
gives
him
his
interest
in
life
and
maroon
him
in
a
desert
of
a
dutch
where
there
absolutely
nothing
for
a
man
to
do
but
smoke
himself
to
death
and
wait
for
a
paper
which
never
comes
till
day
after
it
sounds
terribly
involved
but
i
help
you
reason
it
out
dad
any
time
you
like
said
susie
obligingly
and
you
stay
wo
you
dear
oh
i
stay
since
your
heart
so
set
upon
it
i
try
to
bear
up
and
find
a
diversion
of
some
kind
and
not
rust
out
any
more
than
i
can
help
i
might
dig
in
the
sand
or
make
mud
pies
or
play
but
i
draw
the
line
at
plunging
into
that
whirlpool
across
the
street
my
bed
here
is
nearly
as
comfortable
as
the
one
at
home
and
the
very
well
dad
agreed
susie
instantly
seizing
the
concession
but
speaking
as
though
it
were
she
who
was
making
it
we
stay
here
then
only
i
wish
there
were
a
few
more
people
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
hate
to
sit
down
in
that
big
empty
i
imagine
at
an
egyptian
banquet
and
that
there
are
horrid
rattly
skeletons
sitting
in
all
those
high
covered
chairs
what
you
need
is
some
fresh
air
said
her
father
you
girls
get
your
hats
and
go
for
a
walk
you
growing
morbid
if
you
think
of
skeletons
again
i
give
you
a
liver
pill
wo
you
come
dad
no
you
know
you
do
want
me
besides
i
see
the
panjandrum
who
brings
the
mail
coming
up
the
dyke
down
yonder
he
stood
gazing
down
the
digue
until
his
womenkind
reappeared
bedight
ready
for
the
walk
you
do
he
said
looking
them
over
critically
in
fact
my
dears
if
i
was
afraid
of
making
you
conceited
i
say
i
never
seen
two
handsomer
girls
in
my
life
now
it
you
who
are
blarneying
dad
cried
susie
but
she
dimpled
with
pleasure
nevertheless
and
so
did
nell
no
i
not
retorted
rushford
and
i
dare
say
there
are
plenty
of
other
men
even
in
this
dutch
limbo
who
have
an
eye
for
beauty
let
them
break
their
hearts
if
they
have
any
but
keep
your
own
hearts
whole
my
dears
they
were
laughing
in
earnest
now
as
they
looked
up
in
his
face
which
had
grown
suddenly
serious
why
dad
what
ails
you
questioned
sue
i
think
it
is
you
who
need
the
pill
rushford
face
cleared
they
were
thus
far
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
perhaps
i
do
he
agreed
or
perhaps
it
only
that
i
beginning
to
feel
the
responsibilities
of
my
position
your
position
as
chaperon
he
explained
dear
dad
cried
susie
and
squeezed
his
arm
do
you
suppose
that
as
long
as
we
have
you
either
of
us
will
ever
think
of
another
man
i
do
know
said
her
father
dubiously
i
scarcely
believe
i
so
fascinating
as
all
that
but
i
just
wanted
to
remind
you
girls
that
there
plenty
of
nice
boys
at
home
boys
whom
you
can
trust
through
and
through
boys
who
are
clean
and
honest
and
worth
loving
if
you
lose
your
hearts
and
i
suppose
it
inevitable
some
day
please
do
me
the
favour
of
choosing
two
of
them
i
sleep
better
at
night
and
breathe
easier

day
chapter
ii
the
rôle
of
good
angel
rushford
waved
them
from
the
door
as
they
sallied
forth
into
the
bright
sunlight
paused
a
moment
to
look
after
them
admiringly
and
then
turned
slowly
back
into
the
hotel
smiling
softly
to
himself
he
sauntered
through
the
deserted
vestibule
and
its
emptiness
struck
him
as
it
had
never
done
before
really
he
said
to
himself
we
seem
to
be
the
only
patrons
the
house
has
got
i
have
to
look
over
my
bill
he
went
on
to
the
desk
and
demanded
his
letters
of
the
boy
in
resplendent
uniform
who
presided
there
there
are
none
monsieur
answered
that
individual
blandly
what
cried
rushford
his
smile
vanished
in
an
instant
are
you
sure
the
boy
answered
with
a
shrug
and
a
significant
gesture
toward
the
on
the
wall
it
was
visibly
incontestably
empty
rushford
turned
away
in
disgust
those
fellows
at
the
office
are
assuming
altogether
too
much
responsibility
he
muttered
savagely
as
he
wandered
on
into
the
i
told
them
i
did
want
to
be
bothered
with
little
things
but
i
certainly
expected
to
hear
from
them
once
in
a
while
if
i
do
look
out
they
reduce
me
to
the
status
of
a
rubber
stamp
have
to
stir
them
up
and
he
gloomily
extracted
from
the
rack
the
london
paper
brought
by
the
little
rickety
train
which
struggled
through
at
uncertain
and
infrequent
intervals
from
zunderburg
to
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
sat
down
to
a
perusal
of
the
news
he
proceeded
in
the
most
leisurely
manner
for
he
knew
that
he
had
plenty
of
time
indeed
the
paper
once
finished
the
remainder
of
the
day
would
stretch
before
him
an
empty
wilderness
a
waste
as
monotonous
and
bare
as
the
beach
he
had
grown
so
weary
of
gazing
at
so
he
gave
careful
and
minute
attention
to
every
item
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
long
and
wholly
uninteresting
account
of
a
charity
bazaar
which
the
princess
of
wales
had
opened
and
where
the
duchess
of
had
made
a
tremendous
hit
and
much
money
for
a
worthy
cause
by
selling
her
kisses
for
a
guinea
each
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
discreet
shuffling
of
feet
on
the
floor
beside
his
chair
he
looked
up
to
see
standing
there
the
little
fat
proprietor
of
the
hotel
why
hello
pelletan
he
said
want
to
speak
to
me
eef
monsieur
please
and
pelletan
rubbed
his
chubby
hands
together
in
visible
embarrassment
all
right
sit
down
monsieur
pelletan
coughed
deprecatingly
and
deposited
his
plump
body
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
chair
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
much
depressed
his
usually
rosy
cheeks
hung
flaccid
his
mustachios
drooped
limply
his
little
black
eyes
were
suffused
and
needed
frequent
wiping
a
service
performed
by
a
hand
that
was
none
too
steady
eet
iss
a
matter
of
pusiness
monsieur
he
began
falteringly
you
haf
perhaps
perceive
our
custom
hass
fallen
off
rushford
glanced
about
the
deserted
no
he
said
i
have
seen
any
to
fall
off
i
been
wondering
how
you
managed
to
pay
out
ah
monsieur
cried
pelletan
wringing
his
hands
iss
eet
i
haf
been
paying
out
unt
paying
out
until
las
franc
iss
gone
i
wass
at
no
time
reech
monsieur
at
moment
i
am
in
ruins
and
indeed
he
looked
the
part
you
mean
you
have
to
shut
up
shop
inquired
rushford
eet
preaks
my
heart
to
say
eet
monsieur
but
i
fear
eet
will
come
to
unless
unless
what
asked
rushford
eyeing
him
as
he
hesitated
unless
i
shall
pe
able
to
interes
monsieur
rushford
grunted
and
stared
out
of
the
window
at
the
dunes
puffing
his
cigar
meditatively
he
thought
of
the
comfortable
bed
of
the
admirable
cuisine
he
would
hate
to
give
them
up
it
would
mean
going
to
the
other
hotel
and
the
mere
idea
made
him
shiver
anything
but
that
his
host
watched
him
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
what
does
it
cost
a
day
to
run
this
shebang
asked
the
american
at
last
monsieur
pelletan
with
feverish
haste
produced
a
paper
from
his
pocket
i
haf
anticipate
monsieur
question
statement
will
show
heem
rushford
took
it
and
glanced
at
the
total
hmmmm
four
hundred
and
eighty
francs
say
a
hundred
dollars
monsieur
explained
pelletan
iss
based
upon
our
present
custom
as
pusiness
increase
so
do
expense
increase
of
course
but
not
in
same
ratio
as
receipts
a
full
house
wins
so
much
as
six
hundret
francs
tay
yes
assented
rushford
a
full
house
is
a
mighty
nice
thing
but
now
you
seem
to
be
holding
only
a
a
no
matter
go
ahead
with
the
story
you
say
it
costs
you
a
hundred
dollars
a
day
to
keep
your
doors
open
what
the
heaviest
item
greates
item
at
present
iss
chef
he
iss
a
fery
goot
one
i
haf
feared
to
let
heem
go
that
was
right
you
better
not
let
him
go
if
you
want
to
keep
us
here
how
many
rooms
have
you
pelletan
produced
a
second
slip
of
paper
for
also
i
wass
prepared
my
tear
monsieur
rushford
he
said
tariff
of
charges
iss
also
rushford
looked
it
over
with
some
care
then
he
stared
out
across
the
sands
again
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitching
evidently
the
proposal
appealed
to
his
sense
of
humour
see
here
pelletan
he
said
abruptly
turning
back
is
there
a
hoodoo
on
the
house
or
what
the
matter
a
i
peg
monsieur
pardon
stammered
pelletan
how
does
it
happen
that
the
hotel
over
there
is
full
and
this
empty
eet
iss
way
monsieur
explained
the
frenchman
eagerly
for
many
year
long
pefore
new
part
off
house
wass
puilt
we
enjoyed
confidence
unt
patronage
of
hiss
highness
prince
of
who
spent
at
least
two
month
in
efery
season
here
while
prince
wass
here
we
were
crowded
oh
to
smalles

efen
at
times
we
tid
well
for

but
last
vinter
he

despite
care
of
heem
which
we
haf
taken

he
hass

yet
which
we
haf
cheerfully

ingrate
hass

our
customers
haf
followed
heem
like
sheep
eet
iss
as
we
had
lost
our
star
your
star
in
off
monsieur
karl
pelletan
explained
is
that
such
a
tragedy
i
haf
always
it
fery
worst
could
happen
said
pelletan
but
iss
as
pad
it
was
only
by
a
supreme
effort
that
rushford
managed
to
choke
back
the
chuckle
which
rose
in
his
throat
is
the
little
purblind
fellow
who
is
wheeled
around
in
a
big
red
chair
every
day
fery
same
monsieur
a
great
highness
rushford
made
a
grimace
of
disgust
what
the
matter
with
him
he
asked
does
he
only
need
a
bath
or
is
it
more
than
skin
deep
eet
iss
an
hereditary
trait
monsieur
hereditary
taint
you
mean
you
better
off
without
him
why
infect
the
whole
house
pelletan
pelletan
gazed
at
him
aghast
monsieur
is
choking
he
said
i
in
deadly
earnest
but
i
do
expect
you
to
understand
for
got
an
hereditary
taint
too
pelletan
which
shows
itself
principally
in
your
spine
pelletan
turned
pale
i
assure
you
monsieur
he
stammered
i
am
fery
no
matter
broke
in
rushford
all
european
have
it
and
it
has
never
been
known
to
result
fatally
so
do
worry
but
why
did
you
think
i
take
hold
of
this
thing
i
haf
heard
so
much
explained
pelletan
of
enterprise
of
americans
i
perhaps
you
might
win
back
not
on
your
life
if
he
comes
i
go
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
pelletan
i
make
you
a
proposition
proceed
monsieur
and
the
other
face
began
to
beam
anticipatively
for
one
month
i
pay
all
the
expenses
of
this
hostelry
rent
included
and
allow
you
one
hundred
francs
a
day
for
your
services
i
take
all
the
receipts
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
withdraw
and
leave
you
to
your
own
devices
what
do
you
say
monsieur
pelletan
reflected
at
least
it
was
postponing
the
inevitable
for
a
month
and
in
a
month
what
may
not
happen
besides
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
would
be
richer
by
three
thousand
francs
i
accept
monsieur
he
said
with
fervour
i
am
a
time
all
right
i
take
possession
at
once
we
can
have
a
notary
draw
up
a
formal
agreement
now
let
run
over
this
schedule
of
prices
and
he
turned
to
pelletan
carefully
prepared
statement
fery
well
monsieur
i
see
you
have
two
apartments
de
luxe
at
one
hundred
francs
a
day
hereafter
they
will
be
two
hundred
francs
pelletan
gasped
from
off
course
will
be
a
tiscount
he
stammered
not
a
cent
not
the
tenth
of
a
cent
two
hundred
francs
net
but
monsieur
efen
at
old
price
we
haf
always
gif
a
tiscount
it
iss
only
americans
who
pay
full
price
people
expec
rushford
waved
his
hand
i
do
care
what
they
expect
besides
there
going
to
be
one
hotel
in
europe
where
americans
get
a
square
deal
if
your
compatriots
want
to
patronise
my
house
they
can
go
to
that
lunatic
asylum
across
the
street
by
the
way
what
its
name
grand
hôtel
splendide
answered
pelletan
glowing
with
delight
at
his
companion
power
of
invective
h
m
said
the
latter
the
worse
a
hotel
is
the
bigger
name
it
seems
to
have
but
about
the
discount
let
me
repeat
for
you
pelletan
a
business
axiom
to
give
a
discount
is
to
admit
that
your
goods
are
not
worth
the
price
you
ask
for
them
and
that
you
willing
to
cheat
anybody
who
does
know
enough
to
beat
you
down
all
the
business
of
europe
seems
to
be
run
in
just
that
way
but
ours
wo
be
our
goods
are
worth
the
price
but
began
pelletan
humbly
efen
at
ostend
this
is
not
ostend
this
is
a
place
more
more
comfortable
preferable
in
every
way
and
with
greater
natural
advantages
than
ostend
ever
had
or
ever
will
have
only
a
fool
would
go
to
ostend
when
he
could
come
to
and
stop
at
the
grand
hôtel
royal
pelletan
rubbed
his
hands
in
delight
you
really
so
monsieur
he
murmured
no
matter
what
i
think
besides
you
can
go
back
to
your
old
schedule
if
you
want
to
at
the
end
of
the
month
but
i
fixing
this
new
schedule
to
suit
myself
and
i
do
want
to
be
interrupted
these
ordinary
apartments
will
be
thirty
to
forty
francs
according
to
size
single
rooms
will
be
ten
francs
breakfast
will
be
four
francs
dinner
ten
francs
in
a
word
we
double
our
income
without
increasing
our
expenses
that
the
secret
of
all
high
finance
my
friend
but
monsieur
stammered
pelletan
more
and
more
astounded
eef
iss
no
one
to
pay
what
does
it
matter
there
be
some
one
to
pay
leave
that
to
me
you
do
understand
american
enterprise
pelletan
i
going
to
astonish
you
now
mind
one
thing
if
comes
over
here
and
wants
an
apartment
you
to
shut
him
out
i
wo
have
him
in
the
house
not
at
any
price
pelletan
grew
pale
at
the
thought
refuse
prince
of
he
stammered
yes
if
you
let
him
in
i
kick
him
out
and
another
thing
the
service
has
got
to
be
the
best
in
europe
nothing
gaudy
you
understand
but
a
quiet
elegance
that
will
make
us
talked
about
do
you
think
you
can
accomplish
it
i
vill
do
my
pest
monsieur
promised
pelletan
the
place
of
course
i
have
to
take
as
i
find
it
went
on
rushford
with
a
glance
around
though
it
littered
up
with
gewgaws
and
dinkey
furniture
which
ought
to
be
made
into
a
bonfire
if
i
had
a
little
more
time
i
the
whole
house
those
imitation
marble
pillars
over
there
are
an
insult
to
the
intelligence
haf
peen
fery
beautiful
monsieur
murmured
pelletan
humbly
yes
i
noticed
that
europeans
have
a
weakness
for
imitations
it
a
defect
of
character
i
suppose
but
there
one
thing
you
do
and
right
away
send
that
boy
at
the
desk
up
to
his
room
and
tell
him
to
rip
all
that
gold
braid
off
his
coat
to
look
at
him
you
think
he
was
a
pelletan
stared
at
his
partner
to
see
if
he
was
in
earnest
oh
i
know
it
will
be
a
deprivation
said
the
american
a
glint
of
humour
in
his
eyes
you
can
raise
his
wages
a
franc
a
day
to
make
up
for
it
fery
well
monsieur
and
pelletan
crossed
over
to
the
desk
and
gave
the
boy
his
commands
the
latter
dragged
away
up
the
stair
with
a
countenance
in
which
grief
and
joy
struggled
for
the
mastery
else
monsieur
asked
the
frenchman
coming
back
no
i
do
think
of
anything
just
at
this
moment
but
you
do
your
part
and
i
do
mine
now
suppose
you
go
out
and
get
the
notary
while
i
work
my
brain
a
bit
pelletan
staggered
rather
than
walked
to
the
door
his
head
in
his
hands
fairly
overwhelmed
a
moment
later
rushford
saw
him
hurrying
down
the
street
he
got
out
a
third
cigar
and
settled
back
in
his
chair
with
a
chuckle
of
satisfaction
maybe
i
get
some
fun
out
of
this
thing
after
all
he
said
offer
a
little
diversion
anyway
now
how
shall
we
begin
to
advertise

is
he
here
inquired
a
voice
and
rushford
looked
around
to
see
a
man
in
resplendent
uniform
standing
at
the
door
that
me
i
reckon
he
said
this
is
my
first
day
explained
the
man
i
will
know
monsieur
hereafter
i
have
a
telegram
and
he
produced
it
monsieur
will
make
acknowledgment
here
he
added
and
held
out
a
narrow
white
slip
of
paper
rushford
signed
his
name
mechanically
dropped
a
franc
into
the
itching
palm
and
waited
till
the
messenger
went
out
then
he
looked
at
the
address
on
the
envelope
it
was
grand
hôtel
royal
well
he
said
it
mine
i
guess
there
no
question
of
that
the
proprietor
pro
tem
and
he
tore
the
envelope
open
a
low
whistle
escaped
him
as
he
read
the
message
then
he
slapped
his
leg
and
laughed
it
a
freak
of
the
market
he
cried
a
freak
of
the
market
and
just
my
luck
to
be
in
on
the
ground
floor
he
folded
the
telegram
and
placed
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
then
he
fell
again
into
a
meditation
punctuated
by
frequent
chuckles
but
at
the
end
of
a
very
few
minutes
monsieur
pelletan
was
back
again
with
a
thin
little
notary
in
tow
and
the
necessary
papers
were
soon
drawn
up
you
have
only
to
sign
monsieur
said
the
notary
after
he
had
finished
reading
them
aloud
and
he
handed
his
formidable
pen
to
rushford
monsieur
pelletan
rubbed
his
hands
together
nervously
as
the
american
hesitated
and
looked
at
him
it
not
too
late
to
draw
out
remarked
rushford
if
you
not
satisfied
i
haf
no
tesire
to
traw
out
monsieur
protested
pelletan
quickly
i
am
entirely
satisfied
i
have
one
other
condition
to
make
added
the
american
what
iss
eet
monsieur
questioned
pelletan
looking
at
him
apprehensively
you
understand
i
to
be
a
silent
partner
in
this
thing
a
a
silent
partner
in
other
words
nobody
to
know
i
backing
you
unless
i
choose
to
tell
them
absolutely
no
one
do
you
agree
oh
gladly
monsieur
cried
pelletan
with
a
deep
breath
of
relief
after
all
is
not
glory
the
next
best
thing
to
riches
and
your
friend
the
notary
nodded
a
solemn
promise
of
secrecy
all
right
and
rushford
signed
pelletan
hastily
affixed
his
signature
and
the
thing
was
done
now
my
friend
continued
the
american
which
is
the
swellest
suite
of
rooms
you
got
in
the
house
de
luxe
a
responded
pelletan
monsieur

i
wish
you
to
get
it
ready
at
once
monsieur
will
occupy
it
himself

toubt

where
i
am
but
between
seven
and
eight
morning
there
will
arrive
an
english
ship
of
war
a
echoed
pelletan
growing
pale
certainly
a
ship
of
war
and
from
it
there
will
disembark
a
man
named
vernon
and
his
suite
of
four
or
five
people

a
pelletan
caught
his
breath
monsieur
vernon

rushford
i

well
he
the
head
of
the
british
foreign
office

and
one
of
the
high
nobility
beside
him
will
look
like
thirty
cents
chapter
iii
distinguished
arrivals
at
even
at
this
unaccustomed
hour
of
the
morning
the
beach
was
black
with
people
it
was
not
to
bathe
that
they
had
come
for
a
chill
north
wind
was
blowing
nor
was
it
to
promenade
for
they
were
not
promenading
indeed
it
was
the
fashionable
hour
for
neither
of
these
things
and
no
one
ever
dreamed
of
doing
them
at
any
hour
other
than
the
fashionable
one
it
was
rather
the
fashionable
hour
to
turn
painfully
over
in
bed
and
ring
the
bell
and
signify
that
coffee
and
rolls
would
be
acceptable
this
morning
there
had
been
scant
time
for
such
refreshment
or
for
that
preliminary
stretching
which
is
so
grateful
to
bodies
wearied
by
late
hours
and
living
instead
nearly
all
the
sojourners
at
had
arisen
aching
from
their
beds
had
hurried
forth
to
the
beach
and
stood
there
now
facing
unanimously
seawards
staring
toward
the
dim
horizon
only
moving
convulsively
from
time
to
time
in
the
effort
to
keep
warm
those
who
had
glasses
used
them
those
who
had
none
strained
nature
binoculars
to
the
limit
of
vision
from
all
of
which
it
will
be
seen
that
the
notary
had
done
his
work
well
and
that
neither
had
monsieur
pelletan
been
backward
in
spreading
the
great
news
of
the
unparalleled
occurrence
which
was
about
to
happen
he
iss
to
arrive
between
hours
of
seven
unt
eight
he
had
announced
hiss
highness
pe
it
understood
lord
vernon
great
englishman
he
comes
in
a
special
vessel
a
he
added
with
a
triumphant
flourish
he
could
pring
mit
him
whole
nafy
of
england
if
he
wish
ah
what
an
honour
for
and
what
a
blow
for
the
grand
hôtel
splendide
across
the
way
yet
monsieur
pelletan
did
not
in
the
least
understand
how
it
had
come
to
pass
he
suspected
his
partner
of
some
sort
of
clairvoyance
of
some
supernatural
power
of
compelling
events
and
his
admiration
for
him
had
deepened
to
awe
but
into
this
question
he
did
not
permit
himself
to
enter
deeply
he
was
content
to
know
that
fame
and
prosperity
were
returning
with
a
rush
to
the
grand
hôtel
royal
already
there
had
been
a
score
of
applicants
for
rooms
the
corridors
were
again
assuming
that
air
of
liveliness
and
gaiety
which
had
characterised
them
in
those
golden
days
when
the
august
prince
of
had
been
his
annual
guest
he
was
no
longer
ashamed
to
meet
the
proprietor
of
the
grand
hôtel
splendide
face
to
face
in
the
full
day
he
was
a
different
person
from
the
despairing
individual
of
the
day
before
in
a
word
he
was
no
longer
in
ruins
he
had
been
restored
as
so
many
ruins
are
by
the
hand
of
an
american
at
this
moment
he
held
the
centre
of
the
stage
and
it
was
easy
to
read
in
his
bearing
the
consciousness
that
he
deserved
the
limelight
a
strip
of
crimson
carpet
had
been
stretched
across
the
sand
to
the
very
edge
on
either
side
of
it
a
dozen
decorous
footmen
were
aligned
and
between
them
monsieur
pelletan
proudly
marched
his
head
in
air
his
back
very
straight
preceding
a
big
hooded
invalid
chair
immediately
a
murmur
arose
he
is
ill
then
why
the
chair
he
is
coming
to
take
the
baths
the
murmur
no
doubt
penetrated
to
the
ears
of
the
little
alsatian
but
he
made
no
sign
he
was
aware
that
the
envious
eyes
of
the
proprietor
of
the
grand
hôtel
splendide
were
upon
him
he
would
show
him
that
here
was
a
guest
more
majestic
more
worthy
of
honour
than
even
the
prince
of
a
highness
in
short
so
extraordinary
as
to
cause
that
august
personage
to
resemble
in
some
incomprehensible
way
the
sum
of
one
franc
fifty
centimes
otherwise
there
would
have
been
no
carpet
for
the
sand
was
hard
and
dry
otherwise
too
perhaps
monsieur
pelletan
would
have
been
content
to
permit
his
to
represent
him
at
the
water
edge
for
he
was
not
accustomed
to
exposing
himself
thus
to
the
sharp
airs
of
the
morning
his
fat
red
cheeks
and
plump
nose
were
turning
a
dull
purple
ah
how
good
would
a
glass
of
cognac
taste
but
he
bore
this
discomfort
with
the
greatest
fortitude
for
after
all
an
occasion
such
as
this
was
worth
some
sacrifice
and
be
it
said
his
was
not
the
only
purple
nose
in
evidence
there
were
many
men
who
stared
straight
before
them
daring
to
look
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
and
many
women
who
were
thankful
for
the
heavy
veils
they
had
had
the
forethought
to
put
on
even
rouge
however
cunningly
applied
can
not
hide
certain
ugly
lines
in
the
face
in
the
clear
cruel
light
of
the
morning
strange
how
the
same
breeze
will
give
to
some
cheeks
a
dull
repulsiveness
and
to
others
an
entrancing
glow
a
word
to
lovers
would
you
test
your
mistress
blood
and
spirit
persuade
her
to
a
walk
some
sharp
day
in
winter
or
if
she
will
not
be
persuaded
use
a
little
artifice
then
after
wind
and
frost
have
had
their
will
of
her
for
half
an
hour
take
a
look
at
her
are
her
cheeks
glowing
are
her
eyes
bright
is
she
having
a
good
time
if
not
take
heed
there
were
four
cheeks
upon
the
beach
at
that
morning
glowing
as
i
would
have
your
true
love
glow
drawing
men
eyes
and
women
too
the
one
in
admiration
the
other
in
envy
yes
envy
though
more
than
one
shivering
fair
spoke
a
low
slurring
word
about
those
coarse
americans
both
pelletan
and
the
notary
had
been
careful
to
respect
rushford
wish
that
his
connection
with
the
hotel
be
kept
to
themselves
in
all
their
boastings
rejoicings
explanations
his
name
had
not
been
whispered
and
not
even
to
his
daughters
had
that
gentleman
confided
the
secret
of
his
plan
to
get
the
excitement
he
had
craved
so
badly
he
had
feared
perhaps
that
they
would
not
enter
thoroughly
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
women
even
american
women
are
sometimes
strangely
deficient
in
the
sense
of
humour
but
they
had
both
been
struck
by
their
impressive
obsequiousness
a
very
orgasm
of
servility
which
pelletan
had
hitherto
reserved
for
personages
of
the
blood
royal
what
ails
the
man
susie
had
asked
at
dinner
the
night
before
her
eyes
on
monsieur
pelletan
writhing
form
he
seems
to
have
the
he
is
probably
fishing
for
a
tip
said
nell
it
seems
to
me
that
i
seen
those
symptoms
before
in
a
less
violent
form
do
you
tip
him
commanded
their
father
i
attend
to
all
that
and
he
beckoned
to
pelletan
with
his
finger
and
whispered
a
rapid
sentence
in
his
ear
what
did
you
say
to
him
dad
inquired
sue
gazing
in
some
astonishment
after
their
host
retreating
i
told
him
to
go
back
and
sit
down
answered
rushford
going
calmly
on
with
his
meal
dad
is
it
true
that
lord
vernon
is
to
arrive
morning
i
suppose
so
in
a
ship
of
war
yes
i
heard
that
too
you
take
us
down
to
the
beach
wo
you
dad
what
a
american
citizen
go
toadying
after
the
english
aristocracy
but
we
need
a
cicérone
dad
what
for
i
like
to
know
oh
what
are
cicérones
always
for
to
get
us
a
good
place
to
be
sure
so
here
he
was
in
the
forefront
of
the
crowd
with
his
womenkind
beside
him
and
no
doubt
the
discerning
reader
has
already
guessed
that
it
was
to
their
cheeks
i
referred
some
pages
back
there
were
many
grandes
dames
upon
the
beach
that
morning
some
the
real
thing
a
little
plain
a
little
faded
rather
touching
to
look
upon
others
for
the
most
part
articles
de
paris
very
tall
and
plump
and
even
handsome
if
one
likes
the
gorgeous
type
with
gowns
created
by
the
great
costumers
and
paid
for
heaven
knows
how
but
i
always
think
with
a
little
warmth
of
pride
and
admiration
of
those
two
american
girls
standing
there
and
radiant
coarse
madame
ah
what
would
you
not
give
for
a
little
of
that
coarseness
after
all
freshness
is
a
woman
greatest
charm
as
you
very
well
know
madame
though
you
try
your
best
to
think
otherwise
and
alas
you
are
fast
losing
yours
for
as
you
have
found
as
untold
thousands
have
found
before
you
and
will
yet
find
one
ca
squander
one
youth
and
keep
it
too
aye
more
than
that
the
sins
of
the
night
stare
at
one
from
one
glass
on
the
morrow
and
will
not
be
massaged
away
take
your
baths
madame
in
milk
or
wine
or
perfumed
water
summon
your
masseuse
your
let
them
rub
you
and
knead
you
and
pinch
you
coat
you
with
cold
cream
or
grease
you
with
oil
of
olives
redden
cheeks
and
lips
whiten
hands
and
shoulders
polish
nails
pencil
eyebrows
squeeze
in
the
waist
pad
out
the
hips
swallow
at
the
last
that
little
tablet
which
you
slip
from
the
jewelled
case
at
your
wrist
it
is
all
in
vain
you
deceive
no
man
nor
woman
they
look
into
your
eyes
and
smile
but
behind
the
smile
there
is
a
shudder
nell
and
susie
rushford
with
the
wind
playing
in
their
hair
and
kissing
their
cheeks
that
morning
were
miracles
of
freshness
two
divine
messages
two
phantoms
of
delight
sent
from
the
new
world
to
the
old
and
one
was
dark
with
tints
of
violet
in
hair
and
eyes
and
one
was
blond
as
she
who
rose
a
second
daybreak
from
the
sea
and
nell
the
elder
was
tall
and
fair
like
her
father
rather
sedate
with
not
quite
the
sparkle
of
susie
two
years
her
junior
the
counterpart
of
the
little
mother
whom
she
had
never
seen
and
both
were
erect
and
as
only
american
girls
seem
to
know
completely
how
to
be
visibly
healthy
happy
and
i
should
like
to
pause
and
look
at
them
a
moment
longer
for
i
have
always
been
a
little
in
love
with
them
myself
i
should
like
to
add
to
the
verses
of
our
own
dear
poet
certain
lines
of
wordsworth
of
burns
of
byron
but
you
dear
reader
will
recall
them
readily
especially
if
you
belong
as
i
hope
you
do
to
the
great
and
glorious
fraternity
of
true
lovers
if
your
heart
burns
and
your
pulses
leap
at
mention
of
a
certain
name
at
sight
of
a
dear
face
there
came
a
sudden
hum
of
excitement
from
the
crowd
look
look
cried
susie
there
it
is
and
she
clapped
her
glasses
to
her
eyes
again
far
out
against
the
horizon
appeared
a
smudge
of
smoke
which
grew
and
spread
until
those
with
glasses
could
perceive
beneath
it
the
low
dark
lines
of
a
it
was
true
then
some
had
permitted
themselves
to
doubt
the
story
spread
so
industriously
by
monsieur
pelletan
and
his
friend
the
notary
the
proprietor
of
the
grand
hôtel
splendide
had
counselled
scepticism
now
they
could
doubt
no
longer
and
they
drew
a
deep
breath
a
ship
of
war
at
straight
toward
the
beach
she
steamed
looming
larger
and
ever
larger
then
her
speed
slackened
slackened
until
at
last
she
lay
rolling
quietly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
a
shrill
piping
came
over
the
water
as
the
crew
was
mustered
amidships
and
the
lowered
well
he
be
a
swell
said
sue
or
they
would
take
all
that
trouble
there
goes
the
boat
and
splash
it
went
into
the
water
the
crew
tumbled
in
and
two
men
slowly
helped
another
down
the
stairs
while
the
crew
stood
at
attention
some
baggage
was
lowered
then
the
oars
dipped
together
and
a
little
spurt
of
foam
appeared
under
the
bow
why
it
like
a
machine
cried
susie
with
a
little
gasp
of
enjoyment
or
a
comic
opera
she
added
wrestling
with
her
glasses
to
get
them
focussed
on
the
moving
boat
the
hero
sitting
in
the
stern
she
announced
he
all
wrapped
up
and
there
another
man
holding
him
i
ca
see
anything
of
him
but
his
eyes
for
he
got
a
handkerchief
or
something
over
the
lower
part
of
his
face
he
must
be
awfully
ill
poor
fellow
probably
got
the
grip
observed
her
father
practically
wants
to
keep
out
the
damp
air
i
think
he
be
better
off
at
home
in
bed
oh
but
then
protested
nell
then
we
should
have
this
show
said
her
father
and
laughed
grimly
at
the
thought
that
neither
would
fortune
have
smiled
so
promptly
on
the
grand
hôtel
royal
the
oars
flashed
suddenly
upright
two
men
sprang
from
the
bow
with
a
fine
disregard
of
a
wetting
and
pulled
the
boat
far
in
then
the
bemuffled
figure
was
lifted
tenderly
and
carried
to
the
waiting
chair
where
monsieur
pelletan
was
bowing
with
his
head
almost
touching
the
carpet
the
invalid
was
started
toward
the
hotel
without
delay
three
men
accompanying
him
under
the
leadership
of
pelletan
the
baggage
was
heaped
on
the
beach
and
taken
in
charge
by
the
hotel
porters
a
moment
later
the
boat
shoved
off
a
few
waited
to
watch
it
make
its
way
back
to
the
ship
which
immediately
steamed
away
toward
the
horizon
others
followed
the
procession
headed
by
the
invalid
chair
still
others
hurried
ahead
to
confer
their
patronage
upon
the
grand
hôtel
royal
but
the
greater
part
hastened
back
to
their
rooms
to
get
something
hot
and
bracing
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
place
was
with
wagging
tongues
why
should
the
foreign
secretary
of
the
british
empire
have
chosen
as
his
abiding
place
merely
because
he
was
ill
and
wished
to
rest
bah
to
believe
that
would
be
to
show
a
mind
the
most
credulous
would
be
to
evince
an
ignorance
of
high
diplomacy
the
most
profound
again
why
should
he
have
made
the
journey
from
england
in
a
ship
of
war
depend
upon
it
there
was
a
mystery
here
a
mystery
not
to
be
solved
in
a
moment
even
by
such
eminent
amateurs
as
those
assembled
at
it
would
take
time
it
would
take
study
but
it
was
worth
it
there
was
something
behind
all
more
than
appeared
on
the
surface
in
a
word
a
plot
and
the
best
place
to
study
it
the
only
place
indeed
was
the
grand
hôtel
royal
so
instantly
there
was
a
great
packing
of
luggage
a
despatching
of
couriers
an
engaging
of
rooms
a
settling
of
bills
which
drove
the
proprietor
of
the
splendide
half
mad
with
chagrin
he
protested
he
swore
he
offered
concessions
the
most
unheard
of
all
in
vain
his
day
was
over
rushford
his
work
as
cicérone
des
dames
accomplished
returned
leisurely
to
the
hotel
while
the
girls
started
for
their
accustomed
walk
he
smiled
grimly
to
himself
as
he
entered
the
office
the
scene
was
so
different
from
that
of
yesterday
for
the
moment
all
was
excitement
monsieur
pelletan
and
his
assistants
were
busy
attending
to
the
wants
of
their
distinguished
guest
down
in
the
kitchen
the
chef
was
cursing
the
stupidity
of
the
unfortunate
menials
under
him
and
striving
madly
to
prove
himself
worthy
the
occasion
the
greatest
of
his
life
every
moment
a
porter
toiled
up
to
the
door
with
a
load
of
luggage
every
moment
some
one
arrived
demanding
a
room
and
not
one
murmured
at
the
tariff
the
lift
groaned
and
creaked
under
the
unaccustomed
weights
put
upon
it
and
moved
more
slowly
than
ever
pelletan
as
he
hurried
past
mopping
his
perspiring
brow
had
time
only
for
a
single
glance
at
his
good
angel
but
what
a
glance
such
a
glance
no
doubt
columbus
caught
from
his
lieutenants
at
the
cry
of
land
ho
rushford
leaning
over
the
desk
watching
the
confusion
with
an
amusement
which
had
banished
every
trace
of
ennui
felt
his
arm
touched
he
turned
and
recognised
the
messenger
of
the
day
before
a
second
telegram
for
monsieur
said
that
functionary
with
an
amiable
grin
and
produced
the
message
there
was
no
time
for
hesitation
rushford
took
it
signed
the
blank
and
fished
up
the
expected
tip
oh
what
a
tangled
web
we
weave
he
murmured
and
looked
at
the
address
on
the
little
white
envelope
it
read
le
propriétaire
grand
hôtel
royal
the
plot
thickens
he
murmured
well
it
really
for
me
let
see
and
he
tore
it
open
he
whistled
again
as
he
read
the
message
then
he
called
the
nearest
boy
tell
monsieur
pelletan
to
come
here
at
once
he
said
tell
him
i
must
speak
to
him
on
a
matter
of
importance
at
the
end
of
a
moment
the
little
man
puffed
down
the
stair
exhausted
radiant
iss
eet
not
grand
he
cried
what
a
change
from
yesterday
how
you
haf
accomplishe

rushford

well
at

there

monsieur
pelletan
had
turned
pale
een
a
special
train
he
faltered
what
some
one
else
yes
at
ten
who
iss
eet

monsieur
questioned
pelletan
faintly
his
highness
prince
frederick

markeld
ambassador
from
the
court
of
answered
rushford
dwelling
upon
every
word
we
will
give
him
apartment
b
chapter
iv
an
adventure
and
a
rescue
it
was
not
until
rushford
opened
his
paper
an
hour
later
that
he
fully
understood
the
remarkable
situation
of
which
the
grand
hôtel
royal
had
by
the
merest
chance
become
the
centre
it
is
extremely
unfortunate
said
the
that
lord
vernon
should
have
been
taken
ill
at
just
this
time
when
the
question
of
the
succession
of
is
hanging
in
the
balance
lord
vernon
is
the
only
man
in
the
cabinet
capable
of
dealing
with
the
situation
which
is
as
delicate
as
can
be
imagined
on
the
one
side
are
arrayed
the
sympathies
of
our
reigning
house
and
perhaps
even
our
own
honour
on
the
other
the
plainly
expressed
desires
of
the
german
emperor
the
late
prince
christian
left
no
direct
heirs
so
that
in
any
event
the
succession
must
be
through
a
collateral
branch
the
claims
of
the
rivals
prince
george
of
schloshold
and
prince
ferdinand
of
markheim
are
therefore
evenly
balanced
on
one
side
of
the
scale
however
the
german
emperor
has
thrown
the
weight
of
his
influence
on
the
other
side
is
the
moral
influence
of
practically
all
the
rest
of
europe
but
this
will
scarcely
be
of
any
value
to
prince
ferdinand
unless
he
can
enlist
the
active
support
of
great
britain
which
it
may
be
lord
vernon
though
reluctant
to
withhold
will
find
impossible
to
give
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
from
a
disinterested
prince
ferdinand
seems
by
far
the
more
worthy
of
the
two
claimants
lord
vernon
is
suffering
with
a
very
severe
attack
of
influenza
which
has
been
developing
for
some
days
and
which
has
at
last
become
so
serious
that
his
physicians
have
commanded
a
complete
rest
for
a
week
or
ten
days
one
may
well
conceive
lord
vernon
reluctance
to
heed
this
advice
but
he
has
very
wisely
decided
to
do
so
the
little
seaside
resort
of
on
the
dutch
coast
has
been
selected
as
the
place
for
his
sojourn
and
he
will
be
taken
there
on
sir
john
scaddam
his
physician
and
two
of
his
secretaries
arthur
collins
and
george
blake
will
accompany
him
although
work
of
any
kind
has
been
absolutely
forbidden
him
for
at
least
a
week
it
is
believed
that
the
bracing
atmosphere
of
will
effect
a
cure
in
that
time
is
comparatively
little
known
at
least
in
england
it
is
really
the
old
dutch
of
but
a
number
of
years
ago
it
was
exploited
as
a
and
by
some
enthusiast
more
anxious
to
advertise
the
fact
that
one
may
bathe
there
than
to
observe
the
rules
of
etymology
it
is
rather
out
of
the
way
and
the
route
by
rail
is
so
circuitous
and
uncertain
that
it
was
judged
best
to
spare
lord
vernon
the
fatigue
of
such
a
journey
by
conveying
him
directly
thither
upon
the
he
hopes
to
find
there
a
quiet
and
seclusion
which
would
be
impossible
at
any
of
the
larger
resorts
we
understand
that
prince
george
is
with
the
german
emperor
at
berlin
and
that
prince
ferdinand
who
is
at
markheim
has
commissioned
his
cousin
prince
frederick
of
markeld
to
place
his
claims
before
our
foreign
office
his
reception
at
this
time
can
hardly
fail
to
cause
acute
embarrassment
there
was
a
more
of
comment
and
veiled
suggestion
that
perhaps
the
wisest
course
for
the
foreign
office
to
pursue
now
that
lord
vernon
guiding
hand
was
for
the
moment
withdrawn
would
be
to
let
affairs
take
their
course
though
it
was
difficult
to
see
how
this
could
consistently
be
done
if
prince
frederick
succeeded
in
gaining
a
formal
audience
and
placing
his
case
before
the
government
already
it
seemed
the
jingo
papers
were
taunting
the
administration
with
undue
truckling
to
the
wishes
of
germany
with
a
lack
of
stamina
and
backbone
in
short
with
something
like
treachery
toward
prince
ferdinand
and
treason
toward
the
royal
family
with
which
the
prince
was
distantly
allied
rushford
gave
a
long
whistle
of
astonishment
then
he
laid
the
paper
on
his
knees
and
stared
thoughtfully
out
across
the
sands
for
some
minutes
of
course
markeld
has
followed
vernon
here
he
said
at
last
i
rather
admire
his
pluck
and
i
like
to
be
present
at
the
interview
it
be
interesting
why
hello
pelletan
he
added
as
the
latter
approached
him
humbly
as
a
slave
approaches
the
sultan
want
to
speak
to
me
eef

answered
the
little
frenchman
who
was

deep

besides
you

monsieur
agreed
pelletan
with
a
gesture
of
despairing
obedience
iss
one
more
i
haf
an
idea
that
good
let
have
it
said
rushford
encouragingly
nothing
like
ideas
monsieur
will
remember
began
pelletan
in
a
voice
carefully
lowered
we
agreed
to
touble
price
of
entertainment
yes
what
of
it
anybody
been
kicking
no
au
contraire
monsieur
house

full
efery

monsieur
far
petter
oh

wunderschön
well

pelletan
impressively
and
are
many
more
asking
for
rooms
oh
temanding
prince
among
number
why
may
not
we
again
touble
price
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
looking
triumphantly
at
his
partner
but
his
face
fell
as
the
latter
shook
his
head
no
he
asked
eet
will
not
do
no
said
rushford
slowly
i
afraid
it
wo
do
you
see
it
would
be
a
kind
of
ex
post
facto
proceeding
a
i
to
quite
comprehen
monsieur
no
matter
trust
me
see
what
happened
since
yesterday
and
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
busy
corridor
oh
eet
iss
kolossal
cried
pelletan
i
shall
nefer
cease
to
atmire
monsieur
perhaps
he
suggested
timidly
since
he
hass
peen
so
successful
monsieur
may
pe
tempted
to
remain
permanently
surely
he
would
pe
one
great
success
in
a
year
two
year
we
would
eclipse
ostend
monsieur
himself
hass
said
eet
no
laughed
the
other
i
do
think
i
care
to
remain
though
of
course
he
added
the
possibility
of
great
success
is
always
fascinating
oh
eet
iss
more
a
possibility
cried
pelletan
eet
is
a
certainty
a
certainty
is
not
so
fascinating
as
a
possibility
the
american
pointed
out
his
eyes
twinkling
unt
continued
pelletan
persuasively
fancying
no
doubt
that
he
saw
some
signs
of
yielding
in
his
partner
face
eef
monsieur
remains
he
can
haf
house
done
ofer
to
suit
heem
he
can
away
furniture
he
does
not
like
he
can
paint
out
marble
columns
he
can
cause
all
servants
to
pe
tressed
to
hees
taste
he
would
make
one
grand
sensation
house
would
pe
talk
of
europe
tint
we
would
soon
pe
reech
oh
reech
and
the
little
frenchman
stretched
his
arms
wide
to
indicate
the
vast
extent
of
the
wealth
that
was
awaiting
them
but
rushford
shook
his
head
no
pelletan
he
said
no
i
really
ca
do
it
it
utterly
impossible
or
your
impassioned
eloquence
would
certainly
prevail
there
nothing
i
like
better
than
to
show
the
of
europe
a
thing
or
two
they
are
more
conceited
with
less
reason
for
being
so
than
any
other
class
of
men
i
know
but
i
got
to
go
back
to
america
before
long
to
look
after
my
business
there
besides
i
do
really
feel
that
is
my
lifework
i
afraid
it
would
pall
upon
me
after
a
time
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
if
you
wish
pelletan
tear
up
the
agreement
and
say
no
more
about
it
you
may
have
all
the
profits
oh
cried
the
frenchman
dazzled
by
this
munificence
by
the
golden
vision
which
danced
before
his
eyes
then
he
hesitated
with
his
partner
marvellous
influence
withdrawn
might
not
the
whole
wonderful
structure
come
tumbling
about
his
ears
it
would
be
like
pulling
out
the
foundation
what
would
prevent
his
guests
from
packing
up
and
leaving
no
monsieur
he
said
slowly
at
last
i
prefer
eet
as
eet
iss
very
well
and
rushford
laughed
again
it
was
not
the
first
time
his
partners
in
business
had
been
afraid
to
do
without
him
let
it
be
that
way
then
have
you
got
that
agreement
with
you
yess
monsieur
eet
iss
here
and
he
produced
it
from
an
inner
pocket
let
me
have
it
a
minute
pelletan
gave
it
to
him
with
trembling
hand
his
partner
opened
it
got
out
his
and
changed
a
word
in
the
contract
there
he
said
that
more
fair
pelletan
pelletan
paled
as
he
looked
at
the
paper
and
his
eyes
grew
misty
instead
of
one
hundred
francs
daily
he
would
receive
two
hundred
ah
these
magnificent
americans
the
interview
to
which
the
looked
forward
with
so
much
apprehension
was
it
seemed
indefinitely
postponed
the
prince
of
markeld
had
indeed
immediately
upon
his
arrival
caused
his
presence
to
be
formally
announced
to
lord
vernon
but
the
latter
had
responded
that
he
was
for
the
present
under
the
orders
of
his
physician
who
forbade
him
to
see
any
one
or
to
transact
business
of
any
kind
whereat
the
prince
had
twisted
his
mustachios
fiercely
with
an
accompaniment
no
doubt
of
sub
voce
profanity
and
had
proceeded
to
amuse
himself
until
luncheon
with
an
exceedingly
ugly
bulldog
he
had
brought
with
him
he
had
luncheon
in
his
apartment
smoked
a
cigarette
or
two
despatched
a
telegram
describing
the
state
of
affairs
to
prince
ferdinand
and
then
looking
from
his
window
and
perceiving
that
all
the
world
was
abroad
prepared
for
a
walk
along
the
beach
at
the
door
he
happened
to
look
back
and
caught
his
dog
eyes
fixed
wistfully
upon
him
ah
jax
old
boy
he
said
it
is
unfair
to
leave
you
shut
up
here
with
only
glück
for
company
like
to
come
along
jax
wriggled
his
delight
and
you
behave
yourself
jax
promised
as
clearly
as
a
dog
could
very
well
then
and
the
prince
went
down
the
stair
with
jax
with
joy
behind
him
now
the
prince
was
a
very
fellow
erect
and
clean
as
german
noblemen
have
a
way
of
being
besides
he
was
a
prince
a
commander
of
favours
from
the
world
and
women
not
a
mere
suitor
for
them
as
most
poor
mortals
are
and
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
gazed
at
him
languishingly
from
under
pencilled
brows
as
he
strolled
moodily
along
the
beach
golden
yellow
in
the
sunlight
more
than
one
crimson
mouth
shaped
itself
to
an
entrancing
smile
more
than
one
sullied
heart
beat
high
at
thought
of
a
brilliant
future
but
on
this
occasion
none
of
the
sirens
won
an
answering
glance
for
the
prince
was
in
no
mood
for
flirtation
and
besides
he
was
used
to
sirens
so
he
strolled
on
deep
in
thought
this
affair
of
state
which
rested
upon
his
shoulders
promised
to
go
badly
if
lord
vernon
persisted
in
his
refusal
to
see
him
he
was
checkmated
at
the
start
before
he
had
opportunity
to
make
a
move
delay
meant
ruin
and
his
cousin
had
trusted
everything
to
him
he
knew
very
well
that
the
emperor
would
not
delay
that
he
would
use
every
minute
to
strengthen
his
position
that
he
would
compel
events
not
dance
attendance
on
them
he
the
prince
must
see
lord
vernon
at
any
cost
he
must
demand
an
audience
he
must
appeal
to
his
patriotism
his
sense
of
honour
the
love
of
fair
play
which
every
englishman
possesses
he
must
make
refusal
impossible
he
paused
and
looked
up
conscious
of
a
sudden
commotion
on
the
beach
just
ahead
of
him
then
he
saw
his
dog
dancing
frantically
about
a
young
lady
who
held
in
her
arms
a
little
white
spaniel
which
she
had
evidently
just
snatched
up
from
annihilation
markeld
started
forward
with
a
leap
but
at
that
instant
a
tall
figure
emerged
from
a
hooded
chair
nearby
and
with
a
quick
and
kick
sent
the
dog
spinning
oh
thank
you
cried
susie
rushford
looking
up
into
a
very
handsome
face
it
was
my
great
good
fortune
said
the
stranger
bowing
to
be
of
service
to
a
compatriot
oh
you
are
an
american
no
an
englishman
but
at
least
we
speak
the
same
language
i
know
the
word
for
it
neither
do
i
compatriot
will
do
you
were
just
in
time
and
you
did
it
very
neatly
added
nell
admiringly
glancing
at
the
discomfited
jax
who
was
looking
about
him
dazedly
thank
you
and
the
stranger
checking
the
words
which
were
evidently
upon
his
lips
bowed
again
turned
quickly
back
to
his
chair
buried
himself
in
its
recesses
and
retired
behind
a
newspaper
well
gasped
sue
meeting
her
sister
astonished
eyes
i
must
say
but
what
she
must
have
said
will
remain
forever
a
mystery
for
just
then
the
prince
of
markeld
came
hurrying
up
i
hope
there
is
no
damage
he
said
speaking
with
just
the
slightest
accent
he
is
my
dog
he
added
seeing
their
questioning
glance
i
am
very
sorry
i
was
a
little
preoccupied
and
was
not
noticing
him
he
is
usually
a
very
good
dog
i
can
not
understand
why
he
should
have
attacked
yours
he
is
mine
laughed
susie
patting
the
spaniel
upon
his
silky
head
he
just
ran
to
me
for
refuge
evidently
a
most
intelligent
dog
observed
the
prince
gravely
you
think
so
asked
susie
her
colour
deepening
just
the
faintest
bit
ah
here
is
the
owner
now
she
added
as
a
little
faded
old
woman
came
panting
up
oh
thank
you
mademoiselle
cried
the
newcomer
snatching
the
dog
from
susie
arms
thank
you
he
was
a
bad
boy
he
run
away
and
she
held
him
close
against
her
heart
it
was
nothing
protested
susie
i
am
very
glad
i
happened
to
be
just
here
though
i
do
suppose
that
either
i
or
the
dog
was
in
danger
of
being
eaten
she
added
to
markeld
as
the
little
old
woman
trotted
tremulously
away
your
dog
does
look
especially
ferocious
still
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
repeated
the
prince
i
should
have
kept
my
eye
on
him
come
here
jax
he
called
and
make
your
apologies
to
the
ladies
jax
crawled
up
very
humbly
and
susie
stooped
and
patted
his
head
poor
jax
she
said
it
was
your
fault
i
know
i
sure
that
little
spaniel
insulted
you
jax
licked
her
hand
gratefully
and
the
prince
looked
on
with
an
admiration
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
would
you
like
him
he
asked
eagerly
susie
started
up
with
crimsoning
cheeks
no
thank
you
she
said
and
taking
her
sister
arm
she
walked
on
chin
in
air
the
prince
gazed
after
her
for
a
moment
then
turned
resolutely
and
continued
on
his
way
well
began
nell
at
the
end
of
a
minute
he
quite
took
my
breath
away
which
he
queried
sue
both
of
them
but
the
first
especially
that
kick
bespoke
football
training
and
he
has
evidently
kept
in
condition
added
sue
the
owner
of
the
dog
was
a
fellow
either
interesting
too
i
have
a
doubt
and
i
do
like
interesting
people
but
the
nerve
of
him
offering
me
his
dog
i
afraid
we
need
a
chaperon
after
all
my
dear
yes
agreed
nell
perhaps
we
do
but
it
would
be
an
awful
bother
they
walked
on
to
the
end
of
the
beach
then
mounted
to
the
digue
and
strolled
slowly
back
toward
the
hotel
enjoying
the
breeze
the
colour
the
sunshine
the
strange
and
varied
life
of
the
place
stretching
along
the
landward
side
of
the
dyke
stood
a
row
of
little
houses
green
and
pink
and
white
with
tile
roofs
mounting
steeply
upward
their
red
surfaces
broken
by
innumerable
dormers
these
had
once
been
the
homes
of
honest
and
industrious
fishermen
but
time
had
changed
all
that
they
had
been
remodelled
to
suit
the
demands
of
business
and
every
house
had
now
on
the
lower
floor
an
expensive
little
shop
with
monsieur
sitting
complacently
at
the
door
and
madame
fat
and
voluble
at
the
and
on
the
floor
above
a
still
more
expensive
suite
of
rooms
to
let
rooms
panelled
in
white
and
gold
resplendent
with
rococo
mouldings
and
crowded
with
abominable
furniture
intended
to
be
coquettish
gilt
chairs
scalloped
tables
embroidered
lambrequins
ottomans
smothered
in
plush
and
fringe
beds
draped
with
curtains
until
they
were
all
but
in
effect
more
french
than
france
here
and
there
between
the
houses
a
glimpse
might
be
had
of
the
low
country
beyond
with
its
sluggish
canal
choked
with
rushes
a
dingy
windmill
here
and
there
and
stretching
away
on
either
side
the
flat
meadows
crinkling
with
yellow
grain
and
the
green
pastures
dotted
with
huge
cattle
a
narrow
road
straight
as
a
line
in
euclid
and
bordered
by
a
row
of
trees
each
the
counterpart
of
all
the
others
mounted
toward
the
horizon
leading
principally
to
a
low
yellow
house
about
a
mile
away
displaying
above
its
door
the
appropriate
motto
lust
en
rust
there
either
in
the
cool
garden
in
the
long
or
in
some
smaller
and
more
ornate
apartment
one
might
breakfast
dine
what
not
in
the
fashion
of
the
country
which
for
the
most
part
meant
the
drinking
of
a
muddy
liquid
with
an
unpronounceable
name
and
the
eating
of
wafelen
and
poffertjes
and
of
little
cheeses
calculated
to
appal
the
strongest
stomach
the
shops
and
the
landscape
the
cosmopolitan
crowd
with
its
babel
of
many
tongues
the
great
hotels
built
of
stucco
in
the
style
so
rasping
to
sensitive
nerves
the
striped
awnings
the
low
balconies
the
gaudy
all
these
our
heroines
looked
at
and
commented
on
and
revelled
in
with
the
joy
of
fresh
and
unspoiled
youth
it
was
life
they
were
tasting
strange
interesting
intoxicating
life
and
they
drank
deep
of
it
as
they
neared
the
hotel
entrance
they
saw
coming
from
the
other
direction
pushed
by
two
men
an
invalid
chair
they
stood
aside
to
let
it
pass
and
its
occupant
carefully
wrapped
in
a
great
glanced
up
at
them
with
a
quizzical
light
in
his
eyes
they
shrank
back
together
against
the
wall
with
a
simultaneous
gasp
of
dismay
for
the
invalid
was
their
athletic
rescuer
of
an
hour
before
the
chair
went
on
to
the
desk
where
it
paused
while
its
occupant
wrote
a
hasty
sentence
on
a
slip
of
paper
which
he
tore
from
his
notebook
a
moment
later
it
was
presented
to
susie
by
one
of
his
attendants
she
took
it
mechanically
and
with
a
low
bow
the
messenger
hurried
back
to
the
chair
what
in
the
world
she
began
dazedly
then
she
unfolded
the
paper
and
read
lord
vernon
will
be
deeply
grateful
if
he
is
not
mentioned
in
connection
with
today
adventure
chapter
v
tellier
takes
a
hand
the
prince
continued
his
walk
to
the
limits
of
the
beach
with
jax
trotting
humbly
at
his
heels
then
he
returned
slowly
to
the
hotel
and
mounted
to
his
apartment
that
will
do
glück
he
said
as
he
gave
him
his
hat
and
gloves
do
let
me
be
disturbed
and
glück
with
his
imperturbable
mahogany
face
silently
withdrew
to
mount
guard
without
the
door
the
prince
sat
down
lighted
a
cigarette
and
stared
moodily
out
of
the
window
down
upon
the
shifting
crowd
which
still
thronged
the
beach
his
hand
hanging
inert
by
his
side
became
suddenly
the
receptacle
for
a
moist
nose
ah
jax
and
did
she
pat
you
on
the
head
old
boy
he
asked
and
are
you
properly
proud
jax
wiggled
his
remnant
of
a
tail
would
you
like
to
belong
to
her
jax
and
get
patted
every
day
yet
she
would
take
you
snapped
me
off
short
as
that
stump
of
yours
when
i
offered
you
to
her
why
was
that
jax
jax
could
say
not
being
familiar
with
the
ways
of
fair
americans
and
the
prince
patted
him
softly
on
his
nobbly
crown
just
the
same
she
was
a
beauty
jax
slim
straight
full
of
fire
a
thoroughbred
and
with
a
sense
of
humour
my
dear
which
you
will
find
in
not
many
women
did
you
notice
her
cheeks
jax
and
her
eyes
but
of
course
not
you
were
very
properly
grovelling
before
her
and
i
owe
you
eternal
gratitude
old
boy
but
for
you
i
have
stalked
past
without
seeing
her
that
would
have
been
a
pity
would
it
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
glück
head
appeared
i
thought
i
told
you
began
the
prince
your
highness
will
pardon
me
explained
glück
quickly
but
there
is
a
man
here
who
insists
that
your
highness
will
see
him
who
is
he
this
is
his
card
your
highness
and
glück
entered
the
room
i
have
sent
it
back
once
saying
that
your
highness
was
not
to
be
disturbed
he
returned
it
insisting
markeld
took
the
card
glanced
at
it
and
read
andré
tellier
paris
agent
du
service
de
sûreté
beneath
this
was
a
pencilled
line
concerning
the
question
of
the
succession
the
prince
stared
at
it
a
moment
in
some
astonishment
not
unmixed
with
irritation
what
could
this
fellow
know
concerning
the
succession
it
was
most
probably
simply
an
impertinence
the
paris
police
were
famous
for
impertinences
glück
started
for
the
door
since
his
master
boyhood
he
had
watched
over
him
attended
him
he
could
read
his
countenance
like
an
open
book
the
prince
glanced
up
where
are
you
going
he
demanded
i
go
to
tell
the
imbecile
that
your
highness
will
not
see
him
responded
glück
impassively
his
hand
on
the
knob
the
prince
smiled
he
had
a
great
fondness
for
his
old
retainer
wait
he
said
we
must
not
permit
ourselves
to
be
governed
by
first
impressions
nor
swayed
by
prejudice
it
is
just
possible
that
this
fellow
has
something
to
tell
me
which
i
ought
to
hear
i
ca
afford
to
disregard
any
chance
so
inform
tellier
that
i
will
see
him
and
he
lighted
a
fresh
cigarette
resignedly
as
he
watched
the
smoke
turn
gray
in
the
sunlight
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
in
some
unaccountable
manner
the
question
of
the
succession
had
receded
somewhat
into
the
background
it
no
longer
seemed
to
him
of
such
overwhelming
consequence
at
least
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
it
a
moment
before
but
of
something
very
different
there
appeared
at
the
door
a
figure
which
drew
a
stare
of
surprise
from
markeld
accustomed
as
he
was
to
eccentric
habiliment
it
was
arrayed
in
a
long
frock
coat
and
shiny
black
trousers
a
hand
gloved
in
lavender
kid
carried
a
top
hat
while
the
other
caressed
from
time
to
time
the
mustachios
and
imperial
adorning
a
countenance
which
was
a
singular
mixture
of
craft
and
vanity
the
little
eyes
were
under
drooping
baggy
lids
the
nose
was
long
and
sharp
the
lips
very
thin
and
severe
though
at
this
moment
parted
in
a
smile
meant
to
be
ingratiating
the
figure
entered
and
bowed
profoundly
disclosing
glück
disgusted
face
in
the
doorway
monsieur
tellier
asked
the
prince
tellier
bowed
again
and
the
prince
noticed
the
white
line
of
scalp
leading
with
geometrical
precision
from
the
brow
to
the
bald
spot
on
the
crown
and
then
on
down
the
back
of
the
head
it
reminded
him
somehow
of
the
lake
of
constance
with
the
rhine
flowing
through
it
you
have
something
to
communicate
he
continued
repressing
a
smile
something
of
the
first
importance
your
highness
said
the
frenchman
otherwise
i
should
not
have
taken
the
liberty
of
disturbing
your
highness
very
well
and
the
prince
motioned
him
to
a
chair
sit
down
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
you
it
is
something
said
the
frenchman
with
a
glance
at
the
open
door
which
should
be
communicated
if
your
highness
please
in
confidence
glück
shut
the
door
commanded
the
prince
now
my
dear
sir
proceed
your
highness
is
of
course
aware
began
the
detective
sitting
down
with
a
back
very
straight
and
drooping
his
lids
until
his
eyes
were
almost
closed
that
france
is
deeply
interested
in
this
question
of
the
succession
and
that
its
sympathies
are
wholly
with
prince
ferdinand
the
cousin
of
your
highness
and
whom
i
understand
your
highness
represents
markeld
nodded
we
should
naturally
expect
france
sympathy
he
said
france
proclaimed
tellier
raising
his
chin
proudly
is
always
on
the
side
of
justice
and
decency
more
especially
continued
the
prince
drily
when
the
emperor
of
germany
happens
to
be
on
the
other
side
come
now
confess
if
the
emperor
were
for
us
you
would
be
against
us
is
it
not
so
tellier
permitted
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
to
flicker
across
his
lips
your
highness
speaks
with
a
bluntness
disconcerting
he
said
deprecatingly
i
wished
merely
to
clear
the
air
said
the
prince
and
to
prick
at
the
outset
the
bubble
with
which
you
were
trying
to
dazzle
me
let
me
assure
you
that
we
thoroughly
understand
france
attitude
in
this
matter
she
is
on
our
side
simply
because
she
sees
an
opportunity
of
humiliating
through
us
an
old
enemy
least
said
tellier
your
highness
agrees
that
we
are
on
your
side
the
reasons
for
this
attitude
do
not
concern
me
i
only
know
that
we
are
anxious
to
do
all
we
can
to
help
your
highnesses
cause
consequently
when
it
was
learned
that
lord
vernon
was
coming
to
this
place
the
department
of
state
fearing
some
duplicity
asked
that
a
competent
man
be
sent
here
to
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
developments
said
the
prince
seeing
that
the
other
hesitated
for
a
word
and
to
watch
for
an
opportunity
of
forcing
england
hand
precisely
your
highness
and
my
superiors
did
me
the
honour
of
selecting
me
for
this
delicate
task
a
wise
choice
i
do
not
doubt
said
the
prince
gravely
that
tellier
had
any
important
revelation
to
make
he
did
not
in
the
least
believe
but
there
seemed
a
chance
of
extracting
some
amusement
from
the
situation
and
time
was
hanging
heavily
on
his
hands
would
hang
heavily
until
the
hour
of
the
promenade
i
hope
to
prove
it
so
your
highness
cried
the
detective
flushing
with
pleasure
at
the
compliment
in
fact
i
think
that
i
may
say
i
have
already
proved
it
so
ah
said
the
prince
and
lighted
another
cigarette
i
arrived
soon
after
your
highness
i
took
a
wagon
from
zunderburg
rather
than
lose
precious
time
by
waiting
for
the
train
of
this
afternoon
i
was
very
weary
for
the
journey
from
paris
is
a
trying
one
but
before
seeking
repose
indeed
without
even
permitting
myself
to
think
of
my
own
fatigue
i
ascertained
that
lord
vernon
occupied
apartment
a
de
luxe
and
your
highness
apartment
b
de
luxe
in
this
hotel
indeed
said
the
prince
i
naturally
took
care
at
once
to
secure
a
room
here
since
it
was
of
the
first
importance
that
i
should
be
in
a
position
to
see
everything
that
might
occur
naturally
agreed
the
prince
though
it
was
very
difficult
since
every
room
was
taken
for
another
man
it
would
have
been
impossible
but
for
you
i
see
nothing
is
impossible
observed
the
prince
very
few
things
your
highness
agreed
tellier
modestly
in
this
case
i
had
but
to
speak
a
single
word
and
he
paused
with
an
air
of
triumph
wonderful
cried
the
prince
and
clapped
his
hands
softly
some
day
i
must
get
you
to
teach
me
that
word
it
must
be
very
useful
well
what
next
an
hour
rest
tellier
continued
and
i
was
myself
again
i
soon
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
a
girl
who
keeps
her
eyes
open
and
i
learned
many
things
it
was
not
to
tell
me
them
that
you
came
here
i
trust
interposed
the
prince
i
care
little
for
backstairs
gossip
oh
not
at
all
as
your
highness
says
they
would
most
probably
not
interest
you
but
to
one
in
my
profession
no
fact
is
uninteresting
no
occurrence
is
too
trivial
to
be
noticed
well
get
on
to
your
story
then
said
the
prince
with
some
impatience
just
after
luncheon
today
your
highness
walked
on
the
beach
said
tellier
accompanied
by
the
dog
yonder
jax
growled
softly
as
he
caught
the
frenchman
eye
which
pleased
him
no
more
than
it
had
glück
that
is
true
agreed
the
prince
what
of
it
the
dog
attacked
a
small
spaniel
which
sought
refuge
with
two
ladies
one
of
whom
picked
it
up
all
ancient
history
i
assure
you
monsieur
tellier
yet
wait
a
moment
do
you
happen
to
know
who
the
ladies
were
they
are
sisters
said
tellier
their
name
is
rushford
their
father
is
a
tall
american
who
incessantly
smokes
a
cigar
and
reads
a
newspaper
in
the
office
of
the
hotel
if
your
highness
wishes
i
can
make
further
inquiries
not
at
all
cried
the
prince
violently
i
wo
countenance
such
impertinence
go
on
with
the
story
tellier
bowed
to
indicate
the
most
implicit
obedience
it
happened
that
i
was
near
by
he
said
at
the
moment
of
the
encounter
i
had
taken
my
stand
near
a
large
which
for
reasons
interested
me
i
was
nonchalant
impassive
alert
without
seeming
to
be
so
many
of
the
women
passing
i
had
met
upon
the
boulevards
under
circumstances
the
most
peculiar
concerning
many
of
the
men
i
knew
more
than
they
would
wish
the
world
to
know
seeing
me
standing
there
some
of
them
turned
pale
others
grew
red
with
emotion
some
went
by
endeavouring
to
appear
not
to
have
seen
me
others
threw
me
appealing
glances
never
by
the
quiver
of
a
lash
did
i
show
that
i
recognised
them
i
stood
and
waited
like
the
sphinx
for
what
inquired
the
prince
whose
sense
of
humour
had
returned
to
him
for
the
dénouement
your
highness
i
knew
that
sooner
or
later
it
would
come
i
knew
it
could
not
escape
me
tellier
the
evidence
of
duplicity
which
i
was
seeking
but
objected
the
prince
what
duplicity
can
there
be
if
lord
vernon
is
ill
your
highness
will
pardon
me
for
interrupting
but
much
depends
upon
that
if
on
the
other
hand
the
illness
is
only
for
the
moment
assumed
oh
nonsense
cried
markeld
what
reason
could
he
have
for
assuming
illness
that
would
be
childish
the
frenchman
smiled
a
smile
as
he
softly
caressed
his
imperial
and
his
little
eyes
glowed
with
anticipated
triumph
let
us
deal
with
the
facts
first
if
your
highness
will
permit
and
with
reasons
afterwards
i
was
then
standing
by
the
chair
in
the
attitude
which
i
have
described
when
your
dog
appeared
and
attacked
the
spaniel
as
the
young
lady
stooped
and
picked
it
up
your
dog
sprang
against
her
frightening
her
so
that
she
cried
aloud
and
you
stood
by
without
offering
to
assist
her
demanded
the
prince
with
some
indignation
there
was
no
need
your
highness
responded
tellier
easily
in
the
first
place
she
was
of
course
in
no
real
danger
in
the
second
place
i
perceived
instantly
that
fate
was
playing
into
my
hands
in
fact
the
incident
could
not
have
been
more
à
propos
if
it
had
been
arranged
by
my
guardian
angel
for
from
the
chair
beside
which
i
was
stationed
a
man
sprang
out
and
kicked
the
dog
away
your
highness
must
have
remarked
his
agility
and
strength
may
even
have
seen
his
face
no
said
the
prince
i
was
not
near
enough
to
see
it
distinctly
i
saw
it
your
highness
very
distinctly
and
i
assure
you
that
it
was
that
of
a
man
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
health
even
from
his
agility
your
highness
could
doubtless
judge
whether
the
man
was
seriously
the
prince
hitched
about
in
his
chair
a
little
impatiently
he
was
beginning
to
find
the
frenchman
tedious
most
certainly
he
was
not
seriously
ill
he
agreed
nor
i
should
say
even
slightly
so
what
is
that
to
me
pray
have
done
with
this
mystery
tellier
face
was
glowing
with
all
a
frenchman
pride
in
a
coup
de
théâtre
his
moment
of
triumph
had
arrived
of
all
the
eyes
which
witnessed
that
episode
seemingly
so
slight
and
so
unimportant
he
said
proudly
mine
were
the
only
ones
which
saw
its
full
significance
your
highness
will
no
doubt
be
surprised
when
i
inform
you
that
this
gentleman
so
agile
and
so
athletic
was
no
other
than
lord
vernon
chapter
vi
the
path
grows
crooked
in
the
of
apartment
a
in
the
south
wing
of
the
grand
hôtel
royal
lord
vernon
was
tramping
nervously
up
and
down
while
his
companions
regarded
him
with
evident
anxiety
i
tell
you
fellows
he
was
saying
it
ca
be
kept
up
i
thought
so
from
the
first
but
all
the
rest
of
you
seemed
to
think
it
would
be
so
infernally
easy
that
i
was
ashamed
to
say
anything
i
knew
something
was
sure
to
happen
to
give
us
away
and
something
has
happened
what
was
i
to
do
sit
there
like
a
mummy
and
allow
that
dog
to
frighten
those
girls
to
death
what
the
deuce
are
you
laughing
at
collins
i
laughing
at
your
tragic
tone
no
you
could
have
sat
still
though
i
do
suppose
the
young
ladies
were
in
any
serious
danger
they
were
pretty
no
doubt
ah
said
vernon
with
a
mental
smacking
of
the
lips
at
the
entrancing
picture
the
words
called
up
that
of
course
made
it
doubly
impossible
to
sit
still
did
they
know
you
oh
no
never
saw
me
before
had
the
slightest
suspicion
that
they
were
talking
to
such
a
famous
personage
they
said
they
were
americans
then
i
do
see
that
any
harm
has
been
done
unfortunately
when
i
was
coming
back
all
bundled
up
in
my
chair
we
ran
right
into
them
down
here
at
the
door
and
they
recognised
me
instantly
i
could
tell
that
by
their
gasp
of
amazement
as
they
shrank
back
against
the
wall
still
if
you
preserved
a
cold
and
haughty
demeanour
they
may
have
concluded
they
were
mistaken
cold
and
haughty
nothing
broke
in
the
third
man
i
was
there
and
i
swear
he
winked
no
i
did
wink
laughed
vernon
though
perhaps
i
should
if
dared
they
mighty
taking
girls
well
what
you
do
demanded
collins
with
just
a
trace
of
impatience
again
vernon
laughed
i
sent
back
a
note
asking
not
to
tell
he
said
collins
threw
up
his
hands
in
horror
and
the
third
man
grinned
sardonically
vernon
looked
at
them
and
kept
on
laughing
you
two
fellows
take
it
too
seriously
he
added
i
do
believe
they
tell
i
thought
you
knew
women
better
than
that
said
collins
reproachfully
i
do
know
them
better
than
any
diplomat
at
least
and
i
believe
we
can
trust
these
two
for
a
few
days
anyway
how
much
time
do
we
need
a
week
at
the
very
least
fancy
asking
a
woman
to
keep
a
secret
for
a
week
and
as
for
taking
it
too
seriously
you
know
how
much
depends
on
it
yes
observed
vernon
sarcastically
you
fellows
seem
to
think
the
peace
of
europe
depends
on
it
i
should
say
that
would
not
be
overstating
it
in
the
least
said
collins
with
a
solemnity
almost
religious
oh
nonsense
you
diplomatic
fellows
make
mountains
out
of
molehills
you
see
a
storm
in
every
cloud
you
imagine
the
lightning
going
to
strike
you
every
time
it
flashes
you
all
nerves
anyway
you
agreed
yes
i
know
i
agreed
interrupted
vernon
irritably
and
i
was
a
fool
to
do
it
besides
added
blake
we
got
to
play
very
close
since
it
happens
that
markeld
is
in
this
very
hotel
we
supposed
of
course
that
he
would
go
on
to
london
i
must
say
that
i
think
he
showed
exceedingly
poor
taste
in
following
us
here
oh
i
do
know
said
vernon
i
think
it
was
rather
enterprising
i
only
wish
we
could
treat
the
poor
devil
fairly
well
since
he
is
here
continued
blake
there
only
one
thing
for
you
to
do
and
that
is
to
stay
under
cover
but
confound
it
protested
vernon
i
ca
stay
cooped
up
here
in
these
rooms
all
the
time
that
the
only
safe
way
observed
collins
suppose
markeld
should
find
out
how
the
land
lies
the
fat
would
be
in
the
fire
for
sure
and
we
be
in
a
mighty
awkward
position
suppose
the
jingoes
got
hold
of
it
and
he
turned
pale
at
the
thought
well
i
wo
stay
shut
up
that
certain
said
vernon
doggedly
as
for
the
jingoes
let
them
rave
that
easy
to
say
retorted
collins
with
irony
when
some
one
else
has
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
vernon
snorted
impatiently
you
may
frighten
yourself
whenever
you
please
he
said
but
you
frighten
me
i
heard
the
cry
of
wolf
entirely
too
often
but
the
wolf
came
at
last
blake
pointed
out
well
it
is
coming
this
time
and
i
do
care
if
it
is
i
repeat
categorically
and
imperatively
wo
stay
shut
up
you
agreed
to
obey
our
instructions
you
know
every
one
has
the
right
to
rebel
against
a
tyrant
at
least
said
collins
yielding
the
ground
grudgingly
you
must
remember
always
to
keep
on
your
when
you
do
go
out
and
to
try
to
look
a
little
less
scandalously
healthy
than
you
are
now
if
kept
on
your
wraps
when
you
jumped
out
of
the
chair
how
was
i
to
kick
a
dog
with
a
rug
around
my
legs
you
fellows
give
me
credit
for
what
i
did
do
i
just
got
into
a
most
interesting
conversation
with
those
girls
when
up
came
a
fellow
whom
i
knew
instinctively
to
be
markeld
he
stopped
as
he
caught
the
others
astounded
gaze
yes
markeld
he
repeated
defiantly
i
an
idea
that
he
is
the
owner
of
the
dog
i
suppose
i
should
have
sent
james
to
inquire
who
the
dog
belonged
to
before
i
ventured
forth
no
matter
said
collins
impatiently
what
did
you
do
i
was
guilty
of
unpardonable
rudeness
answered
vernon
i
broke
away
from
those
girls
as
though
they
had
the
plague
jumped
into
my
chair
and
buried
myself
behind
my
newspaper
they
must
have
thought
escaped
from
somewhere
so
markeld
did
see
you
it
does
matter
what
they
thought
remarked
collins
oh
does
it
surely
you
not
going
to
run
any
further
risks
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
more
or
less
my
dear
collins
said
vernon
with
chill
politeness
i
have
always
suspected
that
a
course
in
diplomacy
sucked
the
blood
out
of
a
man
and
substituted
in
its
stead
now
i
know
it
permit
me
to
add
that
you
have
not
seen
the
girl
either
girl
though
i
do
suppose
that
would
make
the
slightest
difference
may
i
inquire
what
you
propose
to
do
asked
collins
flushing
a
little
i
propose
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
the
beautiful
americans
in
every
way
i
can
after
all
what
does
it
matter
to
me
who
rules
over
a
little
twopenny
duchy
called
i
suppose
your
promise
is
of
equal
indifference
to
you
damn
my
promise
see
here
collins
do
push
me
too
far
the
worm
will
turn
of
course
i
keep
my
promise
but
do
irritate
me
all
on
edge
over
this
thing
now
a
little
more
and
i
be
capable
of
doing
something
a
tap
at
the
door
interrupted
him
and
he
disappeared
between
two
curtains
into
the
inner
room
where
an
invalid
chair
buried
in
wraps
stood
by
the
window
near
it
was
a
little
table
covered
with
medicine
bottles
glasses
spoons
in
a
word
all
the
paraphernalia
of
prolonged
and
serious
illness
blake
opened
the
door
and
took
the
card
that
was
presented
to
him
the
prince
of
markeld
he
said
looking
at
it
ah
yes
you
will
tell
his
highness
that
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
condition
of
lord
vernon
who
thanks
him
for
his
kind
inquiries
he
closed
the
door
and
turned
back
into
the
room
now
what
do
you
think
that
means
he
asked
of
collins
that
the
second
time
today
he
getting
importunate
collins
stared
out
of
the
window
gloomily
perhaps
he
suspects
already
he
said
i
been
told
he
a
clever
fellow
in
fact
he
proved
it
once
or
twice
suppose
he
does
suspect
what
shall
we
do
convince
him
to
the
contrary
where
scaddam
in
his
room
i
suppose
better
send
for
him
may
i
come
out
inquired
a
voice
from
the
inner
room
yes
come
ahead
called
collins
and
vernon
reappeared
now
my
friend
he
continued
rapidly
you
better
go
in
and
put
on
your
vernon
groaned
put
on
thick
i
believe
markeld
suspects
the
trick
we
playing
and
we
got
to
fool
him
we
got
to
show
him
what
a
sick
man
you
are
how
he
suspect
demanded
vernon
incredulously
even
if
he
saw
me
he
could
recognise
me
he
does
know
me
perhaps
those
girls
have
already
given
you
away
nonsense
you
fellows
are
afraid
of
your
own
shadows
he
suspect
just
the
same
we
got
to
be
prepared
for
emergencies
have
you
got
plenty
of
pepper
vernon
groaned
again
plenty
i
tell
you
fellows
i
ruin
my
health
if
i
keep
this
up
much
longer
i
might
easily
burst
a
people
often
do
when
they
sneeze
well
we
have
to
take
the
risk
said
blake
with
grim
complacency
much
risk
you
take
in
fact
i
saw
you
sprinkling
pepper
on
my
handkerchief
this
morning
when
there
was
the
slightest
need
of
it
now
see
here
protested
collins
sharply
what
the
use
of
all
this
argument
we
got
to
see
this
thing
through
whether
we
like
it
or
not
i
sent
for
scaddam
so
he
be
on
the
scene
in
case
of
emergencies
you
mean
if
i
break
a
inquired
vernon
politely
oh
break
your
grandmother
i
tell
you
there
was
a
second
tap
on
the
door
and
vernon
again
made
a
dive
for
the
inner
room
this
time
a
note
was
handed
in
collins
closed
the
door
tore
open
the
envelope
nervously
and
ran
his
eyes
quickly
over
the
contents
come
out
here
you
beggar
he
called
and
vernon
reappeared
on
the
threshold
take
a
look
at
this
he
added
and
held
out
the
note
maybe
you
wo
be
so
cocksure
hereafter
that
diplomats
are
always
making
mountains
out
of
vernon
took
the
paper
and
read
it
slowly
his
face
growing
blanker
and
more
blank
as
he
proceeded
then
he
went
back
to
the
beginning
and
read
it
aloud
the
prince
of
markeld
admired
greatly
lord
vernon
recent
prompt
and
chivalrous
action
which
he
had
the
privilege
of
witnessing
he
is
sure
however
that
his
lordship
illness
can
not
be
so
serious
as
represented
and
hopes
that
his
lordship
will
not
persist
in
refusing
him
an
audience
such
a
course
would
be
neither
ingenuous
nor
fair
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
then
blake
gave
vent
to
a
low
whistle
well
he
said
dazedly
so
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
what
to
be
done
there
only
one
thing
that
can
be
done
collins
said
sharply
already
pointed
out
what
that
is
and
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
wrote
a
rapid
message
how
will
this
do
vernon
will
be
pleased
to
see
the
prince
of
markeld
at
five
this
afternoon
he
has
no
recollection
of
having
recently
performed
any
prompt
or
chivalrous
action
the
prince
has
doubtless
been
misinformed
that
gives
us
half
an
hour
neither
too
much
time
nor
too
little
but
that
folly
protested
blake
how
can
you
carry
it
through
leave
that
to
me
i
got
out
of
tighter
places
than
this
one
and
he
added
turning
to
vernon
if
you
ever
looked
ill
in
your
life
prepare
to
do
it
now
vernon
was
looking
dreamily
over
markeld
note
he
uses
adjectives
well
does
he
he
asked
a
course
would
be
neither
ingenuous
nor
fair
my
word
i
quite
agree
with
him
remember
you
under
orders
said
collins
sternly
under
reasonable
orders
perhaps
admitted
vernon
quietly
with
a
little
tightening
of
the
muscles
of
the
face
i
do
admit
that
either
you
or
blake
is
infallible
what
is
it
you
propose
to
do
we
propose
in
the
first
place
to
send
markeld
this
note
vernon
took
it
and
read
it
at
a
glance
a
note
which
is
of
course
a
lie
he
observed
dispassionately
as
he
handed
it
back
it
is
not
a
lie
retorted
collins
flushing
hotly
it
is
on
the
contrary
the
absolute
truth
there
are
many
ways
of
lying
remarked
vernon
still
more
coolly
it
is
so
much
the
letter
as
the
spirit
which
constitutes
a
lie
this
is
scarcely
the
time
put
in
blake
for
a
lecture
upon
ethics
and
it
would
in
any
event
added
vernon
be
entirely
wasted
upon
the
present
audience
well
what
next
i
think
you
understand
your
part
answered
collins
curtly
the
only
question
is
are
you
prepared
to
play
it
vernon
hesitated
for
an
instant
his
hands
trembling
slightly
i
feel
the
veriest
scoundrel
he
said
bitterly
it
sickens
me
but
you
got
me
fast
yes
agreed
collins
with
a
malicious
grin
we
got
you
fast
though
not
quite
as
fast
as
you
think
perhaps
added
vernon
quietly
i
warn
you
that
i
will
break
the
bonds
if
they
become
too
galling
i
see
that
i
going
to
owe
prince
frederick
a
hearty
apology
before
this
thing
is
over
oh
i
sha
interfere
with
your
apology
when
the
time
conies
retorted
collins
i
should
hope
not
said
vernon
still
more
quietly
then
he
turned
and
entered
the
inner
room
you
must
push
him
too
hard
arthur
said
blake
in
a
low
tone
or
he
kick
over
the
traces
remember
he
is
devilish
and
he
wo
lie
it
takes
a
firm
hand
to
keep
him
under
control
but
i
be
careful
and
he
wo
have
to
lie
it
confoundedly
unfortunate
markeld
have
left
his
dog
at
home
just
see
how
small
a
thing
may
affect
the
fate
of
nations
do
get
philosophical
advised
blake
there
is
time
are
you
going
to
send
that
note
collins
sealed
the
missive
it
our
only
chance
he
said
decidedly
do
you
see
we
got
to
brazen
this
thing
through
we
in
a
corner
and
there
only
one
way
out
he
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
for
the
prince
of
markeld
he
said
as
he
handed
the
note
to
the
man
who
stood
outside
chapter
vii
an
appeal
for
aid
one
can
easily
guess
with
what
delicious
precipitation
the
misses
rushford
having
read
the
note
sent
to
them
by
lord
vernon
and
having
recovered
somewhat
from
the
paralysis
of
amazement
into
which
it
had
thrown
them
hurried
up
the
stair
and
sought
the
privacy
of
their
own
apartment
here
evidently
was
a
mystery
enacting
under
their
very
noses
no
trumpery
neighbourhood
mystery
either
but
one
of
national
aye
even
international
importance
it
made
them
gasp
to
think
of
it
they
were
even
a
little
frightened
by
the
touch
of
a
finger
the
had
been
opened
they
had
been
admitted
behind
the
scenes
to
the
inside
as
they
had
longed
to
be
and
the
experience
was
even
more
interesting
and
exciting
than
they
had
dared
to
hope
they
were
playing
a
part
however
humble
in
the
great
drama
of
european
politics
but
what
can
it
mean
nell
demanded
as
she
read
the
note
for
perhaps
the
twentieth
time
what
can
it
possibly
mean
why
should
lord
vernon
wish
to
appear
ill
when
he
is
i
do
suppose
he
doing
it
for
fun
observed
susie
sagely
no
of
course
not
agreed
nell
there
is
any
fun
in
it
that
i
can
see
but
it
seems
a
very
remarkable
course
of
action
some
great
affair
of
state
must
depend
upon
it
she
added
in
a
tone
slightly
for
her
imagination
was
beginning
to
be
affected
he
seems
awfully
young
to
hold
such
an
important
place
she
added
these
english
statesmen
always
look
younger
than
they
are
said
sue
from
his
pictures
i
always
imagined
that
chamberlain
was
a
comparatively
young
man
and
here
i
read
somewhere
the
other
day
that
he
nearly
seventy
at
any
rate
concluded
nell
since
it
was
for
our
sake
lord
vernon
threw
off
the
mask
so
to
speak
it
is
only
fair
on
our
part
to
keep
quiet
about
it
why
do
you
think
he
ran
away
so
quickly
it
was
almost
rude
i
thought
it
quite
entirely
rude
asserted
sue
but
maybe
he
saw
somebody
coming
whom
he
wished
to
avoid
and
then
both
gasped
simultaneously
the
owner
of
the
dog
of
course
how
dense
we
were
but
who
is
the
owner
of
the
dog
not
an
englishman
no
a
german
i
should
say
yes
did
you
notice
his
accent
and
then
he
is
tall
and
blond
distinguished
looking
and
with
an
air
about
him
an
autocratic
manner
which
makes
me
think
he
a
somebody
he
evidently
not
used
to
being
snubbed
it
perfectly
maddening
exclaimed
nell
with
brows
most
becomingly
wrinkled
if
we
only
knew
something
of
english
politics
we
might
be
able
to
guess
what
it
is
all
about
dad
could
see
through
it
in
a
minute
sighed
susie
but
that
poor
dear
will
never
have
the
chance
because
of
course
we
ca
tell
even
him
and
he
likes
this
sort
of
thing
too
it
would
give
him
just
the
excitement
he
been
sighing
for
and
yet
fate
willed
that
he
was
to
have
the
chance
for
half
an
hour
later
after
a
short
conference
with
monsieur
pelletan
a
gentleman
whom
we
have
met
before
in
the
apartment
of
lord
vernon
approached
him
where
he
sat
in
the
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
beside
him
this
is
rushford
is
it
he
asked
yes
that
my
name
and
the
american
looked
him
over
in
some
surprise
my
name
is
collins
went
on
the
other
i
am
secretary
to
lord
vernon
glad
to
know
you
collins
and
the
american
held
out
his
hand
i
hope
lord
vernon
getting
along
all
right
as
well
as
could
be
expected
thank
you
but
there
has
been
a
little
unforeseen
er
complication
nothing
serious
i
hope
well
yes
to
be
quite
frank
rushford
i
think
it
decidedly
serious
i
sorry
to
hear
that
said
rushford
with
genuine
feeling
we
americans
have
always
taken
a
special
pride
in
lord
vernon
career
his
mother
was
an
american
girl
you
know
and
his
death
would
be
almost
a
personal
loss
to
us
his
death
echoed
collins
staring
there
no
immediate
danger
then
i
glad
of
that
still
if
the
complication
is
as
serious
as
you
think
my
dear
sir
broke
in
the
englishman
you
have
misunderstood
me
lord
vernon
health
is
er
quite
satisfactory
all
things
considered
the
complication
is
in
er
a
rather
delicate
affair
of
state
which
which
anything
i
can
do
asked
rushford
encouragingly
as
the
other
stammered
and
broke
down
yes
there
is
rushford
answered
collins
quickly
taking
his
courage
in
both
hands
or
rather
there
something
your
daughters
can
do
my
daughters
rushford
looked
at
him
again
a
growing
suspicion
in
his
eyes
i
do
quite
understand
you
have
to
be
more
explicit
collins
i
do
see
how
my
daughters
can
have
anything
to
do
with
your
affairs
of
state
i
am
going
to
be
as
explicit
as
i
can
collins
assured
him
but
such
an
infernally
delicate
matter
that
one
hardly
knows
where
to
begin
of
course
what
i
have
to
tell
you
must
be
told
in
confidence
all
right
said
the
american
with
a
little
pucker
of
the
brow
which
told
that
he
did
not
wholly
like
collins
ahead
first
if
you
do
mind
said
the
englishman
looking
about
him
i
think
we
better
get
out
of
this
crowd
suppose
we
go
up
to
my
rooms
suggested
rushford
rising
we
be
free
from
interruption
there
and
can
thresh
the
whole
thing
out
thank
you
assented
collins
of
course
i
understand
he
continued
in
a
louder
voice
as
they
started
toward
the
door
that
the
question
of
stocks
is
always
a
very
complicated
one
and
very
difficult
for
a
layman
to
understand
but
a
man
of
your
experience
the
door
of
the
closed
behind
them
and
he
stopped
whose
benefit
was
that
for
asked
rushford
for
the
benefit
of
a
french
police
spy
who
was
trying
his
best
to
overhear
our
conversation
a
police
spy
did
you
know
him
i
know
his
class
it
impossible
to
mistake
it
they
all
look
alike
it
a
type
which
even
the
comic
opera
has
been
unable
to
burlesque
you
probably
noticed
him
all
moustache
imperial
and
lavender
gloves
oh
him
yes
i
seen
him
and
i
been
rather
itching
to
apply
my
boot
to
his
i
thought
he
was
a
cheap
actor
a
ten
twenty
thirty
as
we
say
in
america
do
you
suppose
pelletan
knows
him
oh
undoubtedly
he
probably
boarding
him
for
nothing
these
french
police
have
a
way
with
them
rushford
bit
his
moustache
savagely
and
resolved
to
have
an
explanation
with
monsieur
pelletan
the
car
stopped
here
we
are
he
said
stepping
out
into
the
corridor
you
see
our
apartment
is
just
over
lord
vernon
i
do
believe
even
a
french
detective
can
disturb
us
here
and
he
locked
the
door
after
them
as
they
entered
besides
my
daughters
will
be
handy
if
we
decide
to
call
them
in
yet
in
spite
of
the
plural
pronoun
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
was
the
one
who
proposed
to
do
the
deciding
thank
you
said
collins
again
i
hope
to
show
you
the
necessity
of
calling
them
in
in
fact
the
principal
favour
i
want
to
ask
of
you
is
an
introduction
to
them
they
can
if
they
will
save
lord
vernon
and
incidentally
the
government
a
lot
of
trouble
rushford
looked
at
him
with
a
little
stare
in
what
way
he
asked
motioning
him
to
a
chair
it
happens
answered
collins
that
by
chance
they
hold
in
their
hands
the
key
to
a
very
important
affair
of
state
nothing
less
than
the
succession
to
they
could
if
they
wished
involve
the
government
in
difficulties
of
the
most
serious
nature
rushford
stared
at
him
yet
a
moment
then
he
settled
back
in
his
chair
have
a
cigar
he
asked
no
you
wo
mind
my
smoking
i
can
think
better
when
i
smoke
now
let
have
the
story
i
anxious
to
hear
what
those
girls
have
been
up
to
i
afraid
they
need
a
chaperon
after
all
chapter
viii
pride
has
a
fall
shortly
before
six
that
evening
the
door
of
lord
apartment
opened
and
the
prince
of
markeld
appeared
on
the
threshold
bowed
out
in
the
politest
manner
possible
by
blake
collins
and
sir
john
he
crossed
the
corridor
paused
irresolutely
at
the
stairhead
then
went
on
toward
his
own
rooms
his
head
bent
his
face
expressing
the
liveliest
dissatisfaction
an
expression
which
deepened
to
disgust
when
on
opening
his
door
he
perceived
tellier
awaiting
him
within
he
would
come
in
explained
glück
after
a
glance
at
his
countenance
he
lied
he
said
your
highness
was
expecting
him
shall
i
throw
him
out
no
said
the
prince
not
yet
and
glück
retired
to
a
convenient
distance
confident
that
his
hour
would
yet
arrive
the
detective
apparently
had
no
uneasiness
concerning
the
result
of
the
interview
for
his
face
was
beaming
with
and
he
greeted
the
prince
with
a
confidence
born
of
certainty
his
eyes
asked
the
question
which
his
lips
were
too
and
discreet
to
articulate
tellier
began
the
prince
abruptly
looking
at
him
with
a
fiery
glance
you
are
either
a
knave
or
a
fool
a
fool
doubtless
since
you
seem
too
stupid
to
be
a
knave
and
you
very
nearly
made
me
appear
another
the
detective
face
dropped
suddenly
from
triumph
to
humility
i
do
not
understand
he
faltered
does
your
highness
mean
i
mean
that
that
story
of
yours
was
a
ridiculous
lie
responded
the
prince
brutally
being
indeed
greatly
overwrought
how
do
i
know
he
added
suddenly
that
you
did
not
intentionally
deceive
me
i
have
only
your
word
what
is
that
worth
how
do
i
know
that
it
was
not
a
trick
a
trick
on
the
part
of
your
government
to
involve
me
with
england
that
would
be
like
you
and
his
hands
clenched
and
unclenched
in
a
most
threatening
manner
i
swear
to
your
highness
protested
tellier
his
cheeks
livid
his
lips
quivering
convulsively
that
i
told
only
the
truth
on
my
heart
i
swear
it
on
my
soul
on
the
grave
of
my
mother
otherwise
pardieu
would
i
have
been
so
imprudent
as
to
remain
here
awaiting
the
return
of
your
highness
the
prince
face
relaxed
a
little
as
he
looked
at
him
no
he
agreed
grimly
after
a
moment
i
do
believe
you
would
yes
you
are
a
fool
and
not
a
knave
for
i
have
just
seen
lord
vernon
with
my
own
eyes
he
is
truly
ill
sneezing
as
though
his
head
would
burst
gasping
for
breath
his
eyes
running
water
cursing
even
the
friends
who
nurse
him
it
was
some
one
else
who
kicked
my
dog
away
you
have
been
deceived
tellier
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
tugging
at
his
imperial
at
his
hair
biting
his
nails
shaking
his
clenched
hands
at
the
ceiling
in
a
very
ecstasy
of
bewilderment
impossible
he
murmured
hoarsely
impossible
how
impossible
cried
the
prince
violently
do
you
presume
to
contradict
me
do
you
dare
to
dispute
my
word
when
i
tell
you
that
i
myself
have
seen
lord
vernon
when
i
describe
his
condition
to
you
he
was
most
courteous
though
he
could
not
speak
above
a
whisper
he
treated
me
more
kindly
than
i
deserved
when
one
considers
the
wording
of
that
note
i
sent
to
him
for
which
i
was
glad
to
apologise
one
could
see
he
was
in
no
condition
to
give
me
audience
to
discuss
business
of
any
kind
he
could
scarcely
sit
erect
oh
there
is
some
knavery
cried
tellier
his
face
purple
i
know
it
i
scent
it
you
are
then
infallible
i
suppose
retorted
the
prince
his
physician
assured
me
that
in
a
week
lord
vernon
would
be
much
better
nearly
well
he
suggested
that
for
a
week
i
do
not
press
my
business
but
you
did
not
agree
screamed
tellier
your
highness
did
not
agree
most
certainly
i
agreed
not
to
agree
would
have
been
to
insult
them
yet
a
second
time
a
week
groaned
tellier
throwing
up
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
despair
then
all
is
lost
how
lost
demanded
markeld
red
with
anger
in
what
way
lost
have
a
care
of
what
you
say
tellier
controlled
himself
by
a
mighty
effort
and
managed
to
speak
with
some
approach
to
calmness
the
german
emperor
will
not
waste
a
week
your
highness
that
is
not
his
way
as
you
very
well
know
he
will
be
at
work
every
hour
every
minute
what
can
he
accomplish
if
the
british
foreign
office
will
do
nothing
will
he
take
the
affair
into
his
own
hands
he
will
not
dare
he
might
dare
your
highness
he
has
dared
things
more
perilous
than
that
but
how
do
we
know
the
british
foreign
office
will
do
nothing
i
tell
you
repeated
the
prince
hotly
that
lord
vernon
is
a
gentleman
something
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
that
he
is
ill
something
you
seem
to
doubt
in
diplomacy
your
highness
even
a
gentleman
may
sometimes
lie
or
at
least
disguise
the
truth
perhaps
even
before
this
he
has
hinted
to
the
emperor
that
he
will
not
interfere
if
he
acts
promptly
perhaps
this
illness
is
merely
a
ruse
to
avoid
a
situation
the
most
awkward
it
was
the
prince
turn
to
stride
up
and
down
to
pluck
at
his
moustache
to
go
red
and
white
if
i
thought
so
he
murmured
hoarsely
if
i
thought
so
there
is
some
underhand
work
in
progress
cried
tellier
growing
more
and
more
excited
some
trap
some
piece
of
trickery
i
know
not
what
but
i
am
certain
i
will
find
out
if
i
thought
so
said
the
prince
again
and
his
face
was
not
pleasant
to
look
upon
for
i
repeat
to
your
highness
that
i
could
not
have
been
mistaken
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
have
been
mistaken
i
saw
lord
vernon
leap
from
his
chair
i
was
as
near
it
as
i
am
to
you
at
this
moment
i
saw
him
return
to
it
and
hide
himself
behind
his
paper
when
he
saw
you
approaching
i
waited
and
saw
his
lackeys
come
after
him
and
lift
him
to
the
invalid
chair
if
i
had
not
been
certain
before
i
was
certain
then
i
followed
him
back
to
the
hotel
yes
he
added
with
sudden
excitement
and
there
was
another
circumstance
which
will
confirm
me
go
on
commanded
markeld
yielding
somewhat
before
this
torrent
of
proof
at
the
door
he
met
the
young
ladies
whom
he
had
rescued
the
americans
they
recognised
him
i
could
see
their
look
of
astonishment
at
perceiving
him
in
the
chair
of
an
invalid
buried
in
rugs
they
stared
after
him
the
chair
stopped
he
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
sent
it
back
to
them
they
read
it
with
eyes
even
more
astonished
did
you
by
any
chance
read
it
also
inquired
the
prince
with
a
deceptive
calmness
no
your
highness
tellier
replied
simply
quite
unconscious
of
his
danger
i
saw
no
way
of
doing
that
unfortunately
i
thought
of
snatching
it
away
but
that
would
have
created
a
turmoil
which
is
always
to
be
avoided
if
possible
but
your
highness
might
easily
gain
possession
of
the
note
the
prince
stopped
him
with
a
fierce
gesture
of
repugnance
do
you
know
what
it
is
that
you
have
the
effrontery
to
propose
to
me
he
demanded
the
frenchman
paused
in
and
swallowed
with
difficulty
his
face
very
red
i
am
certain
he
said
after
a
moment
that
those
young
ladies
know
it
was
lord
vernon
who
rescued
them
they
would
no
doubt
confirm
this
if
your
highness
would
inquire
the
prince
strode
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
do
not
come
back
till
you
can
speak
without
insulting
me
he
said
sternly
one
moment
your
highness
cried
tellier
but
a
moment
i
have
another
proof
oh
you
are
wrong
not
to
believe
me
you
are
wrong
to
yield
to
your
anger
the
proof
broke
in
the
prince
sharply
realising
perhaps
the
justice
of
the
reproach
the
proof
what
is
it
speak
quickly
it
is
this
your
highness
answered
the
detective
striving
desperately
to
steady
his
voice
to
speak
intelligibly
but
an
hour
ago
the
secretary
of
lord
vernon
was
in
conference
with
the
father
of
those
young
ladies
he
approached
him
in
the
he
introduced
himself
he
sat
down
he
began
a
conversation
i
should
have
overheard
everything
but
that
unfortunately
he
was
more
clever
than
i
thought
he
suspected
me
they
went
together
to
monsieur
rushford
apartment
i
followed
i
listened
at
the
keyhole
but
they
went
on
into
an
inner
room
and
the
outer
door
was
locked
so
i
could
not
the
prince
who
had
listened
to
all
this
with
blazing
eyes
suddenly
raised
his
arm
with
a
furious
gesture
glück
he
shouted
that
faithful
servitor
appeared
on
the
instant
his
face
alight
with
anticipation
but
if
there
should
be
a
plot
protested
tellier
hesitating
even
yet
on
the
threshold
if
there
is
a
plot
said
the
prince
sternly
someone
shall
suffer
for
it
depend
upon
that
but
against
gentlemen
the
proof
must
be
conclusive
glück
show
him
out
and
he
shut
the
door
upon
the
unhappy
spy
it
would
have
been
well
observed
glück
calmly
coming
back
after
a
moment
to
have
thrown
him
out
in
the
first
place
i
agree
with
you
said
his
master
you
may
do
so
whenever
you
find
him
here
again
my
friend
and
for
an
instant
glück
almost
smiled
will
your
highness
dine
in
your
apartment
tonight
he
asked
the
prince
hesitated
then
his
face
relaxed
as
at
some
pleasant
thought
no
glück
he
said
i
will
dine
downstairs
get
my
bath
ready
chapter
ix
pelletan
skeleton
as
he
left
the
that
evening
rushford
crooked
an
imperious
finger
at
monsieur
pelletan
i
want
a
word
with
you
he
said
in
his
ear
in
private
monsieur
asked
the
little
frenchman
with
some
trepidation
yes
i
think
it
would
better
be
in
private
that
is
if
you
can
accomplish
it
in
this
bedlam
oh
i
haf
a
place
monsieur
where
no
one
will
intrude
and
pelletan
led
the
way
through
the
hotel
office
to
a
little
door
back
of
the
desk
iss
my
vat
you
call
eet
in
english
my
sty
my
kennel
your
den
iss
a
difference
asked
pelletan
fumbling
with
the
lock
a
sty
is
for
pigs
and
a
kennel
for
dogs
rushford
explained
a
den
is
for
wild
beasts
these
niceties
of
the
english
language
are
not
for
you
pelletan
still
persisted
pelletan
a
man
iss
no
more
a
wild
beast
he
iss
a
dog
or
a
pig
not
nearly
so
much
so
very
often
agreed
rushford
heartily
you
have
me
there
pelletan
sty
would
undoubtedly
be
the
right
word
in
many
cases
fery
well
said
pelletan
proudly
opening
the
door
pehold
my
sty
and
he
stood
aside
that
his
companion
might
enter
it
was
a
little
square
box
of
a
room
jammed
with
such
a
litter
of
as
is
to
be
picked
up
only
on
the
boulevards
trifles
in
bohemian
glass
a
lizard
stuffed
with
straw
carved
fragments
of
jade
and
ivory
a
sèvres
vase
bearing
the
portrait
of
du
barry
an
indian
chibook
a
dresden
shepherdess
a
sabre
of
the
time
of
napoleon
a
leering
hindoo
idol
a
hideous
dragon
in
japanese
bronze
grimacing
furiously
at
a
barye
lion
all
of
them
huddled
together
without
order
or
arrangement
as
they
would
have
been
in
an
auction
room
or
an
antique
shop
in
one
corner
stood
a
low
table
of
italian
mosaic
bearing
a
somewhat
battered
statuette
of
saint
geneviève
plying
her
distaff
and
the
walls
were
fairly
covered
with
photographs
photographs
for
the
most
part
of
women
more
anxious
to
display
their
charms
of
person
to
an
admiring
world
than
to
observe
the
rigour
of
convention
rushford
dropped
into
one
of
the
two
chairs
got
out
a
cigar
lighted
it
and
sat
for
some
moments
looking
around
at
this
wilderness
of
gimcracks
pelletan
you
a
humbug
he
said
at
last
you
came
to
me
yesterday
and
said
your
last
franc
was
gone
unt
so
it
wass
monsieur
but
this
collection
ought
to
be
worth
something
monsieur
means
it
might
pe
sold
undoubtedly
but
monsieur
does
not
know
does
not
understand
tis
all
iss
my
life
eet

here
i
liff
not
out
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
toward
the
door
i
could
no
more
liff
my
head
rushford
looking
at
him
curiously
saw
that
he
was
in
deadly
earnest
really
he
said
you
surprise
me
pelletan
i
had
never
suspected
in
you
such
depth
of
soul

pelletan
leaning
forward

your
existence

rushford
laughing

murmured
pelletan

why

he
motioned
to
the
walls
and
kissed
his
hand
to
a
voluptuous
siren

red
hair

monsieur
no

iss
a
grain
of
sand
from
peach
out
yonder
his
voice
trembled
and
broke
and
he
ran
his
hands
through
his
hair
in
a
very
agony
of
despair
there
there
said
rushford
soothingly
repressing
an
inclination
to
laugh
at
the
grotesque
figure
before
him
do
take
it
so
much
to
heart
i
dare
say
they
drink
your
health
oftener
than
you
imagine
do
you
really

monsieur
asked
pelletan
brightening
and
depend
upon
it

back
to

the
american

year
or
two

fortune

agreed
pelletan
huskily
to
you
in
the
meantime
added
rushford
smiling
keep
the
ladies
if
you
like
to
look
at
them
your
little
foibles
are
no
affair
of
mine
what
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
was
a
matter
of
business
there
a
blatant
detestable
french
spy
in
the
house
who
has
got
to
get
out
he
even
had
the
impudence
to
ogle
my
girls
at
dinner
this
evening
shall
i
kick
him
out
or
will
you
attend
to
the
matter
pelletan
had
grown
paler
at
every
word
until
he
was
fairly
livid
iss
eet
monsieur
tellier
to
whom
monsieur
refers
he
stammered
i
do
know
his
name
but
he
looks
like
a
freak
from
the
he
got
to
go
he
nearly
as
bad
as
pelletan
mopped
his
shining
forehead
and
groaned
dismally
what
is
it
man
demanded
the
american
do
tell
me
that
this
rascal
has
a
hold
on
you
pelletan
groaned
again
more
dismally
than
before
i
was
told
this
afternoon
added
rushford
grimly
that
he
was
probably
staying
here
at
my
expense
eet
iss
not
so
cried
pelletan
his
eyes
flashing
i
pay
for
heem
efery
tay

myself
mit
twenty
franc
for
hees
account
but
what
on
earth
for
demanded
rushford
what
have
you
done
robbed
a
bank
or
committed
murder
pelletan
glanced
around
to
assure
himself
that
the
door
was
tightly
closed
then
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
his
patron
i
haf
a
wife
he
said
slowly
in
a
sepulchral
tone
well
what
of
it
is
that
a
crime
in
france
i
could
almost
believe
it
i
could
not

pelletan

asked
rushford
sympathetically
for
answer
pelletan
went
to
the
statue
of
saint
geneviève
lifted
it
and
took
from
beneath
it
a
photograph
iss
she
monsieur
he
said
and
handed
the
photograph
to
rushford
the
latter
took
one
look
at
it
and
passed
it
back
not
guilty
he
said
you
have
my
profound
sympathy
pelletan
how
did
you
happen
to
get
caught

been
exceedingly
young

pelletan

weak
she
tid
not
hesitate
to

the
little
man

was
bathed
in
sweat
at
the
memory
of
that
degradation
which
his
tongue
refused
to
describe
i
endured
eet
to
last
moment
he
added
thickly
i
fled
you

to
have
alighted
on
your
feet
remarked
rushford

had
made
a
success
of
pusiness
pelletan

unt

brought
mit
me

share
of

until

pad
eef
she
so
much
as
caught
one
leetle
glimpse
of

she
would

and
he
mopped
his
face
again
still
said
the
american
i
do
see
where
tellier
comes
in
pelletan
carefully
replaced
the
photograph
under
the
statuette
and
then
reseated
himself
opposite
his
companion
tellier
knows
her
he
explained
simply
met
her
professionally
perhaps
suggested
rushford
well
what
of
it
eef
i
offend
heem
he
gifes
her
my
attress
continued
pelletan
hoarsely
and
his
forehead
glistened
again
at
the
thought
he
as
much
when
he
arrife
here
unt
i
tol
him
house
wass
full
hm
commented
rushford
i
see
all
right
i
stand
by
you
i
dare
say
i
can
stomach
tellier
for
a
day
or
two
pelletan
breathed
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
tat
iss
kind
he
stammered
i
i
there
there
and
the
american
waved
him
to
silence
and
you
charge
yourself
with
his
keep
but
i
hope
you
have
any
more
skeletons
in
the
closet
my
friend
skeletons
monsieur
such
as
madame
pelletan
oh
said
the
frenchman
naively
madame
pelletan
iss
quite
opposite
off
a
skeleton
monsieur
rushford
paused
at
the
hotel
door
and
looked
out
along
the
digue
it
was
thronged
with
people
hurrying
toward
the
casino
eager
for
the
excitement
but
the
american
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
and
sauntered
slowly
along
breathing
in
the
cool
breeze
from
the
ocean
at
last
he
paused
and
leaning
against
the
balustrade
stood
gazing
out
across
the
moonlit
water
smiling
to
himself
at
thought
of
vicissitudes
he
was
roused
by
the
sound
of
voices
on
the
beach
below
him
he
looked
down
mechanically
but
for
a
moment
saw
no
one
then
deep
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
he
descried
two
figures
walking
slowly
side
by
side
one
was
a
man
and
the
other
a
woman
they
were
talking
in
a
french
so
rapid
and
idiomatic
that
rushford
could
distinguish
no
word
of
it
except
that
the
man
addressed
his
companion
as
julie
there
was
something
strangely
familiar
about
the
figure
of
the
man
and
as
rushford
stared
down
at
him
his
vision
seemed
suddenly
too
clear
and
he
perceived
that
it
was
the
french
detective
tellier
prosecutes
his
loves
he
murmured
smiling
grimly
to
himself
and
turned
back
toward
the
hotel
there
he
stopped
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
julie
he
repeated
julie
where
have
i
heard
that
name
recently
oh
i
remember
julie
is
our
maid
at
the
hotel
i
wonder
he
went
back
abruptly
to
the
parapet
and
looked
over
but
tellier
and
his
companion
had
disappeared
chapter
x
an
introduction
and
a
promenade
warm
and
fair
dawned
the
morning
and
having
at
its
leisure
duly
arisen
bathed
and
breakfasted
the
unemployed
population
of
male
and
female
sallied
forth
to
throng
the
beach
and
digue
to
inhale
the
fresh
air
to
shake
off
so
far
as
possible
the
effects
of
the
evening
dissipations
and
to
exchange
such
toadstool
growths
of
gossip
as
had
sprung
up
over
night
to
join
this
parade
there
presently
came
lord
vernon
reclining
languidly
in
his
invalid
chair
and
muffled
in
many
rugs
but
his
eyes
were
eagerly
alert
and
he
gazed
with
evident
anticipation
down
the
long
promenade
of
the
digue
he
was
attended
by
blake
collins
and
sir
john
all
of
them
determined
no
doubt
to
prevent
a
second
contretemps
but
sir
john
presently
descried
a
learned
and
stopped
for
a
chat
with
him
while
blake
soon
afterward
succumbed
to
the
glance
and
smile
of
a
english
beauty
collins
however
stuck
grimly
to
his
post
being
above
or
below
such
human
weaknesses
there
they
are
cried
vernon
suddenly
with
brightening
eyes
who
asked
collins
following
his
gaze
oh
the
rush
ford
girls
i
suppose
it
will
be
polite
to
show
our
gratitude
i
think
we
owe
them
a
vote
of
thinks
do
you
i
certainly
do
agreed
vernon
straightening
himself
in
his
chair
with
a
vigour
which
had
nothing
of
the
invalid
about
it
will
you
introduce
me
if
i
can
snare
them
without
being
too
intrusive
assented
collins
who
since
the
success
of
his
stratagem
of
the
afternoon
before
had
been
in
an
unusually
complaisant
mood
but
fate
willed
that
they
should
be
snared
without
any
effort
on
his
part
whatever
for
just
then
a
porter
came
by
with
a
truck
piled
high
with
luggage
and
it
and
the
invalid
chair
combined
to
form
an
impasse
from
which
there
was
no
escaping
not
that
either
of
the
young
ladies
displayed
any
very
evident
anxiety
to
escape
said
collins
in
his
best
manner
my
lord
he
continued
turning
to
his
companion
these
are
the
misses
rushford
to
whom
we
owe
so
much
i
hope
i
may
introduce
lord
vernon
to
you
he
added
both
of
them
were
laughing
as
they
took
in
turn
the
hand
which
vernon
rather
eagerly
held
out
i
awfully
glad
to
meet
you
he
said
looking
from
one
to
the
other
and
trying
to
decide
which
was
the
prettier
i
feel
that
we
owe
you
a
great
deal
when
collins
came
back
yesterday
afternoon
and
told
me
what
he
had
the
impudence
to
ask
you
i
was
i
was
very
wrathy
to
put
it
mildly
said
collins
but
i
took
it
meekly
it
was
in
a
good
cause
and
we
did
think
it
impudent
at
all
said
sue
since
we
had
caused
all
the
trouble
it
was
only
fair
that
we
should
bear
a
part
of
it
besides
it
was
by
any
means
so
difficult
as
collins
thought
it
would
be
you
do
mean
that
markeld
actually
asked
you
i
did
believe
do
that
despite
collins
prophecy
he
seemed
to
have
too
much
of
high
politeness
about
him
i
was
sure
he
would
put
in
collins
triumphantly
he
could
afford
to
neglect
such
an
obvious
way
of
making
certain
and
he
much
too
clever
to
have
overlooked
it
you
were
quite
right
lord
vernon
said
susie
very
quietly
though
there
was
a
dangerous
sparkle
in
her
eyes
the
prince
did
not
ask
us
but
a
french
creature
did
a
detective
one
of
his
emissaries
suggested
collins
i
know
him
his
name
is
tellier
i
have
no
reason
to
think
him
an
emissary
retorted
susie
curtly
beginning
to
dislike
the
secretary
i
do
in
the
least
believe
the
prince
would
choose
such
a
one
dad
pointed
him
out
to
us
in
the
last
night
a
thing
of
mustachios
and
eyes
just
the
kind
one
sees
at
the
vaudeville
but
which
i
had
the
least
idea
existed
in
real
oh
she
cried
with
a
little
start
there
he
is
now
almost
near
enough
to
hear
collins
swore
softly
between
his
teeth
for
there
indeed
monsieur
tellier
was
leaning
with
elaborate
negligence
against
the
balustrade
apparently
intent
upon
the
crowd
below
his
countenance
was
quite
inscrutable
calm
as
a
summer
day
which
might
mean
much
or
nothing
for
he
had
an
immense
pride
in
keeping
it
always
so
vernon
took
him
in
with
a
quick
glance
i
recognise
the
type
he
said
ca
we
go
on
miss
rushford
collins
might
form
a
rear
guard
and
james
is
blind
deaf
and
dumb
toward
everything
that
does
concern
him
he
added
as
she
glanced
at
the
stalwart
footman
behind
the
chair
i
very
anxious
to
hear
the
story
but
of
course
if
it
asking
too
much
it
is
answered
susie
promptly
and
fell
in
beside
the
chair
while
collins
and
her
sister
followed
at
a
distance
of
a
few
paces
now
i
think
we
can
talk
without
fear
of
being
overheard
by
monsieur
tellier
but
there
is
really
very
little
to
tell
he
sent
up
his
card
just
before
dinner
yesterday
evening
we
sent
it
back
then
being
persistent
and
not
easily
snubbed
he
sent
up
a
note
which
asked
the
misses
rushford
acquainted
with
the
gentleman
who
came
to
their
assistance
this
afternoon
to
which
the
misses
rushford
added
a
line
are
not
and
sent
it
back
to
him
it
was
too
absurd
it
reminded
me
of
the
agony
column
in
the
the
agony
column
yes
the
lady
dressed
in
blue
who
took
a
broadway
car
yesterday
and
so
on
oh
said
vernon
with
a
smile
yes
we
have
the
same
thing
in
england
and
after
all
continued
susie
our
reply
was
the
exact
and
literal
truth
of
a
kind
which
i
should
imagine
is
well
known
to
diplomats
the
occupant
of
the
chair
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
that
susie
was
the
prettier
it
is
their
favourite
kind
he
assured
her
nothing
delights
them
more
than
to
lie
while
telling
the
truth
them
but
are
you
a
diplomat
there
are
many
who
doubt
it
perhaps
they
will
doubt
it
more
than
ever
before
we
are
out
of
this
tangle
it
awfully
good
of
you
and
your
sister
to
take
an
interest
in
it
but
of
course
we
take
an
interest
and
keep
a
secret
ah
well
perhaps
that
a
little
unusual
especially
after
my
rudeness
he
added
your
rudeness
in
running
away
and
hiding
behind
my
paper
what
did
you
think
of
me
we
did
know
what
to
think
admitted
susie
candidly
though
of
course
afterwards
we
were
able
to
guess
and
i
am
pardoned
oh
quite
you
had
to
escape
you
know
it
a
perfectly
delightful
muddle
is
it
dad
understood
it
at
once
did
he
the
occupant
of
the
chair
moved
a
little
uneasily
yes
we
talked
it
over
you
know
after
collins
left
but
then
dad
is
up
on
politics
and
we
are
not
only
it
a
little
rough
on
the
prince
of
markeld
do
you
think
yes
it
rough
on
him
but
well
it
would
be
rougher
to
turn
him
down
rougher
on
all
concerned
you
have
to
turn
him
down
but
there
i
must
meddle
with
affairs
of
state
sentiment
has
much
show
in
the
foreign
office
said
vernon
with
some
bitterness
not
even
the
sentiment
of
friendship
we
trying
to
find
the
easiest
way
out
susie
nodded
her
eyes
sparkling
this
was
a
new
and
delicious
experience
this
weighing
the
fate
of
nations
as
it
were
she
even
skipped
a
little
unconscious
of
lord
vernon
eyes
upon
her
glowing
face
of
course
she
agreed
judicially
i
suppose
one
must
always
try
to
find
the
easiest
way
out
only
dad
seemed
to
think
she
hesitated
go
ahead
he
encouraged
her
i
do
doubt
that
your
father
was
entirely
right
well
then
dad
seemed
to
think
that
prince
ferdinand
is
much
the
better
of
the
two
men
there
is
no
question
of
that
assented
lord
vernon
gloomily
but
let
me
put
a
case
miss
rushford
suppose
your
best
friend
were
set
upon
by
thieves
and
just
as
you
started
to
help
him
another
thief
came
up
behind
you
and
putting
a
pistol
to
your
head
commanded
you
to
stand
still
what
would
you
do
i
stand
still
laughed
sue
yes
but
your
friend
ca
see
the
thief
behind
you
and
when
he
sees
you
standing
there
not
offering
to
help
him
he
thinks
you
are
a
coward
and
a
traitor
perhaps
he
tells
you
so
in
the
most
emphatic
language
at
his
command
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
position
agreed
sue
still
laughing
at
the
picture
presented
by
the
words
on
second
thought
i
do
believe
i
stand
still
for
long
i
try
to
give
my
thief
a
blow
and
then
go
help
my
friend
but
you
would
have
to
wait
till
your
thief
was
off
his
guard
well
that
is
pretty
much
the
position
that
england
is
in
as
i
understand
it
prince
ferdinand
is
our
friend
but
we
got
to
wait
till
the
man
with
the
pistol
makes
a
false
move
we
doing
the
best
we
can
and
in
the
meantime
prince
ferdinand
misguided
friends
are
calling
us
hard
names
but
inquired
susie
who
is
the
man
with
the
pistol
he
must
be
a
pretty
big
fellow
to
be
able
to
hold
you
prisoner
and
yet
i
must
confess
that
i
like
prince
ferdinand
i
ca
perceive
him
either
lord
vernon
hesitated
a
moment
i
afraid
miss
rushford
he
said
slowly
at
last
that
i
tell
you
just
yet
i
like
to
but
if
i
did
i
have
all
these
diplomatic
sharps
down
on
me
in
short
order
i
thought
maybe
you
could
guess
oh
do
apologise
cried
susie
i
had
any
right
to
ask
though
she
added
regretfully
i
not
at
all
good
at
guessing
lord
vernon
smiled
as
he
looked
at
her
i
do
think
we
have
any
more
trouble
he
said
markeld
and
i
have
called
a
truce
for
a
week
and
by
that
time
he
paused
again
evidently
on
the
verge
of
another
indiscretion
chance
saved
him
the
necessity
of
going
on
for
at
that
moment
a
tall
military
figure
loomed
ahead
approached
hesitated
stopped
and
uncovered
i
hope
i
see
you
better
this
morning
lord
vernon
said
a
pleasant
voice
why
yes
thank
you
your
highness
answered
vernon
colouring
a
little
i
feel
much
better
let
me
introduce
to
you
miss
rushford
he
added
catching
the
other
admiring
glance
and
interpreting
it
aright
miss
rushford
this
is
the
prince
of
markeld
chapter
xi
the
prince
gains
an
ally
so
it
presently
came
to
pass
that
susie
rushford
found
herself
walking
on
with
the
prince
of
markeld
while
nell
took
her
place
beside
the
invalid
chair
five
minutes
later
vernon
had
revised
his
judgment
and
decided
that
nell
was
far
the
handsomer
she
had
the
air
somehow
which
one
associates
with
duchesses
but
which
alas
is
in
reality
so
seldom
theirs
she
was
just
a
little
regal
just
a
little
so
that
to
win
a
smile
impressed
one
as
in
a
way
an
achievement
vernon
had
won
several
before
they
had
been
long
together
and
felt
his
heart
growing
strangely
deliciously
warm
within
him
as
to
sue
if
we
may
pause
to
analyse
her
feelings
she
too
had
been
for
the
first
moment
impressed
the
prince
was
so
visibly
a
highness
every
line
of
him
expressed
it
not
consciously
but
inevitably
from
the
blood
out
so
after
a
glance
or
two
she
walked
along
beside
him
rather
humbly
and
very
silent
not
in
the
least
as
the
proverbial
american
girl
should
have
done
then
she
stole
another
glance
at
him
and
saw
that
he
was
twisting
his
moustache
in
evident
perplexity
you
may
have
perceived
he
said
at
last
with
that
slight
formality
of
utterance
which
sue
thought
very
taking
that
i
was
most
desirous
of
meeting
you
miss
rushford
i
believe
i
discern
a
sort
of
royal
command
in
your
eye
assented
susie
feeling
suddenly
at
ease
with
him
he
was
evidently
a
mere
man
even
though
he
were
a
prince
yes
he
continued
i
felt
that
i
owed
you
and
your
sister
a
more
complete
apology
than
it
was
possible
for
me
to
make
yesterday
without
impertinence
you
see
i
am
unaccompanied
poor
jax
laughed
susie
i
suspect
the
prince
continued
that
i
somehow
offended
you
when
i
offered
you
the
dog
oh
you
perceived
it
did
you
and
she
flashed
an
ironic
glance
upon
him
yes
though
i
could
not
in
the
least
guess
in
what
the
offence
consisted
my
dear
sir
said
sue
tartly
american
girls
are
not
in
the
habit
of
accepting
gifts
from
utter
strangers
not
even
from
from
he
stopped
at
a
loss
for
a
word
which
would
express
his
meaning
without
absurdity
no
not
even
from
royal
highnesses
she
added
interpreting
his
thought
besides
you
know
in
america
we
have
any
the
prince
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
moment
his
brow
knit
in
meditation
your
last
sentence
explains
it
he
said
at
last
you
have
in
america
no
class
whose
prerogative
it
is
to
bestow
gifts
and
in
consequence
you
do
not
accept
them
as
a
matter
of
course
with
us
a
gift
is
a
conventional
thing
like
shaking
hands
i
was
trying
to
explain
it
said
susie
with
a
little
sigh
of
despair
or
to
defend
it
but
let
it
go
then
with
a
flash
of
mischief
are
you
frequently
called
upon
there
are
occasions
almost
every
day
which
demand
them
of
us
answered
the
prince
soberly
missing
the
glance
poor
man
and
the
affair
of
yesterday
was
one
of
them
forgive
me
if
i
am
rude
but
it
is
all
so
new
and
interesting
it
seemed
only
right
explained
the
prince
that
i
should
compensate
you
in
some
way
for
the
annoyance
i
had
caused
you
the
words
were
said
so
candidly
and
simply
that
the
ironical
smile
faded
from
susie
lips
and
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
think
the
american
way
the
nicer
she
said
at
last
decisively
an
american
would
have
considered
an
apology
ample
reparation
with
us
a
gift
means
something
it
has
a
sentimental
value
besides
girls
are
never
permitted
to
accept
gifts
of
value
flowers
are
the
only
things
which
may
be
given
them
flowers
repeated
the
prince
eagerly
looking
at
her
and
only
by
their
nearest
dearest
friends
added
susie
hastily
well
it
is
a
very
different
point
of
view
said
the
prince
the
light
fading
from
his
face
i
have
even
heard
that
in
america
there
are
workmen
who
consider
a
tip
an
insult
it
unthinkable
is
it
and
yet
i
proud
to
say
it
true
i
may
add
that
many
americans
feel
humiliated
when
they
offer
a
tip
to
a
man
it
like
branding
him
with
a
badge
of
servility
i
must
confess
said
the
prince
that
such
an
attitude
seems
to
me
absurd
what
other
badge
than
that
of
servility
shall
the
servant
wear
he
need
wear
no
badge
if
he
does
his
work
honestly
and
well
retorted
susie
hotly
there
is
nothing
disgraceful
in
service
no
agreed
the
prince
with
some
hesitation
perhaps
not
nor
for
that
matter
is
there
anything
disgraceful
in
a
badge
but
i
have
not
said
what
i
wished
to
say
which
was
that
i
hope
you
believe
my
offence
was
wholly
unintentional
and
that
you
pardon
me
i
am
not
vindictive
answered
sue
smiling
at
his
earnest
tone
and
therefore
you
are
pardoned
but
it
seems
unjust
that
jax
should
suffer
imprisonment
oh
he
will
get
his
outing
but
with
glück
who
is
less
yesterday
i
had
much
to
occupy
me
and
not
so
much
i
am
resting
on
my
oars
yes
said
susie
and
contented
herself
with
the
monosyllable
she
was
keenly
on
the
alert
determined
not
to
betray
lord
vernon
confidence
yet
at
the
same
time
desirous
of
helping
in
some
way
her
companion
she
distinctly
approved
of
him
then
too
she
had
somehow
got
the
impression
that
the
other
side
was
not
playing
fairly
and
her
whole
american
spirit
revolted
against
unfairness
i
should
like
to
tell
you
about
it
he
began
with
a
sudden
burst
of
confidence
but
perhaps
you
know
i
know
some
of
it
i
can
guess
that
it
means
a
great
deal
to
you
it
does
more
than
you
can
guess
i
think
not
so
much
to
me
personally
as
to
our
people
i
believe
that
i
am
speaking
only
the
exact
truth
when
i
say
that
it
will
be
much
better
for
the
people
of
if
our
branch
of
the
house
is
recognised
and
not
the
other
our
branch
has
been
in
a
way
for
many
years
progressive
the
other
is
and
always
has
been
well
conservative
he
had
the
air
of
searching
for
a
word
that
would
not
go
beyond
the
truth
susie
glancing
at
him
decided
that
he
had
chosen
one
which
fell
far
short
of
it
we
have
a
certain
claim
of
kinship
and
friendship
upon
england
he
added
and
we
are
very
anxious
to
enlist
her
aid
even
though
we
lose
this
time
for
there
may
soon
be
another
vacancy
the
head
of
the
other
branch
has
no
heir
and
is
not
well
he
might
have
added
that
the
august
prince
george
of
schloshold
was
hovering
on
the
verge
of
dissolution
as
the
result
of
forty
corruption
a
corruption
of
which
not
all
the
waters
of
the
empire
could
cleanse
him
but
there
are
some
things
which
are
better
left
unsaid
who
is
it
that
is
opposed
to
you
in
all
this
asked
sue
the
german
emperor
said
the
prince
simply
he
is
not
always
in
sympathy
with
ah
progress
so
he
is
the
man
with
the
pistol
said
susie
thoughtfully
the
i
beg
your
pardon
and
the
prince
looked
at
her
in
some
surprise
it
is
nothing
said
susie
hastily
colouring
under
his
eyes
i
was
merely
thinking
aloud
thinking
of
a
story
pardon
me
will
you
tell
me
some
more
there
is
not
much
more
to
tell
only
we
fear
that
if
we
are
not
given
an
opportunity
to
present
our
claims
this
time
we
may
be
forgotten
the
next
prince
george
might
possibly
try
to
name
a
successor
we
have
even
understood
that
he
already
considers
doing
so
that
this
indeed
is
the
price
he
has
agreed
to
pay
the
emperor
for
his
support
though
this
of
course
is
strictly
entre
nous
you
see
i
am
trusting
you
thank
you
answered
susie
simply
but
there
was
that
in
her
voice
and
glance
which
told
how
she
would
deserve
the
confidence
and
on
the
instant
a
great
yearning
leaped
warm
into
her
heart
if
she
could
help
this
people
to
the
ruler
they
needed
most
if
she
could
somehow
turn
the
scale
so
delicately
balanced
there
would
be
a
task
worth
doing
an
achievement
to
be
proud
of
all
her
life
and
she
trembled
a
little
at
the
thought
that
to
her
susie
rushford
fate
had
given
such
an
opportunity
but
markeld
apparently
had
had
enough
of
high
politics
or
perhaps
he
found
it
difficult
to
keep
his
mind
on
them
with
susie
dark
eyes
looking
up
at
him
he
was
no
novice
in
womankind
he
had
known
many
high
and
low
but
there
was
in
his
companion
something
different
something
appealing
something
fresh
invigorating
which
he
had
felt
from
the
first
in
a
vague
way
without
quite
understanding
princes
may
be
outspoken
when
they
please
and
he
was
so
at
this
moment
i
was
glad
of
meeting
not
only
that
i
might
apologise
he
said
with
a
calmness
which
rather
took
his
companion
breath
away
but
because
you
interested
me
i
have
heard
much
of
american
women
but
all
that
i
have
heretofore
been
privileged
to
meet
seemed
to
me
to
resent
being
called
americans
you
and
your
sister
on
the
other
hand
appear
to
be
rather
proud
of
it
i
do
know
whether
that
is
intended
as
a
compliment
or
the
reverse
said
susie
but
it
is
undoubtedly
true
it
was
that
which
interested
me
he
went
on
it
indicated
such
an
unspoiled
point
of
view
a
freshness
which
i
fear
the
old
world
is
losing
thank
you
retorted
susie
gasping
a
little
you
have
honoured
us
i
see
with
a
very
careful
study
i
can
respond
by
saying
that
there
is
in
your
manner
a
certain
freshness
which
i
do
not
like
and
she
shot
him
a
fiery
glance
at
the
moment
he
was
rather
too
evidently
the
prince
i
am
sorry
you
find
me
displeasing
he
said
looking
at
her
gravely
perhaps
she
was
at
the
moment
just
the
merest
shade
too
evidently
the
american
girl
i
hope
the
impression
is
one
which
will
change
when
you
know
me
better
am
i
to
have
that
pleasure
i
intend
to
ask
your
father
if
i
may
call
upon
you
susie
gasped
again
she
felt
that
she
was
being
swept
beyond
her
depth
by
a
current
which
she
was
powerless
to
resist
that
she
was
beating
with
bare
hands
against
a
wall
of
incredible
height
and
thickness
the
wall
of
old
world
convention
of
class
imperturbability
and
she
felt
a
little
frightened
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
do
she
said
faintly
realising
that
her
companion
was
waiting
for
her
to
speak
i
think
that
i
shall
like
him
he
added
oh
do
you
know
him
was
looking
at
him
last
night
at
dinner
he
explained
calmly
he
seems
a
very
interesting
man
i
looked
at
all
of
you
a
great
deal
more
than
was
perhaps
quite
polite
i
feared
you
had
perceived
it
no
murmured
susie
desperately
telling
a
white
lie
tellier
told
me
you
were
americans
but
i
should
have
known
it
anyway
tellier
she
repeated
turning
upon
him
fiercely
welcoming
the
opportunity
to
create
a
diversion
then
he
your
emissary
and
to
think
that
i
defended
you
my
emissary
he
stammered
defended
me
yes
when
when
some
one
said
you
had
sent
him
to
us
sent
him
to
you
he
cried
flushing
darkly
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
has
been
annoying
you
it
was
almost
that
ah
he
said
ah
and
he
grasped
his
stick
in
a
way
that
boded
ill
for
monsieur
tellier
susie
glancing
up
at
him
thought
it
very
fine
he
was
such
a
volcano
and
there
was
such
a
fearful
pleasure
in
stirring
him
up
in
skipping
over
the
thin
crust
with
a
lively
consciousness
of
the
boiling
lava
beneath
then
you
did
send
him
she
inquired
sweetly
send
him
miss
rushford
do
you
think
for
a
moment
that
i
would
be
so
rude
so
impertinent
tell
me
you
do
not
think
so
i
think
so
said
sue
biting
her
lip
a
little
fearfully
i
even
defended
you
as
i
have
said
but
now
but
now
his
eyes
seemed
to
burn
her
she
dared
not
look
up
and
meet
them
she
even
regretted
that
she
had
begun
to
play
with
fire
but
now
he
repeated
insistently
imperatively
no
i
do
think
so
now
she
said
with
a
little
catch
of
the
breath
then
she
glanced
up
at
him
and
instantly
looked
away
he
should
not
act
so
every
one
would
notice
it
was
very
embarrassing
that
is
kind
of
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
though
she
added
reprovingly
glad
to
find
a
joint
in
his
armour
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
discuss
me
in
any
way
whatever
with
that
creature
you
are
right
he
agreed
flushing
hotly
you
are
quite
right
but
the
temptation
was
very
great
and
i
wanted
to
know
so
badly
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
i
regretted
it
an
instant
later
i
do
not
want
that
you
should
think
of
me
as
like
that
perhaps
i
would
better
not
think
of
you
at
all
ventured
sue
ah
what
a
fascination
there
is
in
fire
that
would
be
still
more
unbearable
he
protested
his
eyes
were
very
bright
and
he
was
bending
down
a
little
that
he
might
the
better
see
the
face
under
the
broad
hat
the
view
from
here
i
think
is
very
beautiful
she
remarked
incoherently
no
doubt
agreed
the
prince
but
he
did
take
the
trouble
to
look
at
it
he
a
survival
of
the
dark
ages
said
susie
to
herself
when
they
just
snatched
up
girls
and
ran
off
with
them
then
aloud
have
you
ever
been
here
before
never
before
do
you
like
it
oh
very
much
his
eyes
would
have
told
her
why
but
she
could
guess
without
looking
i
suppose
you
usually
go
to
one
of
the
larger
places
it
is
one
of
the
traditions
of
our
family
that
at
least
a
month
must
be
spent
at
ostend
what
a
shame
that
the
tradition
should
be
broken
on
the
contrary
i
bless
the
circumstance
that
shattered
it
do
you
know
miss
rushford
i
have
never
before
realised
what
a
tremendously
lucky
fellow
i
am
i
must
pour
a
libation
to
the
god
of
chance
it
a
goddess
is
it
she
asked
and
regretted
the
question
the
next
instant
you
are
right
he
agreed
his
eyes
blazing
a
goddess
you
have
found
the
word
a
goddess
and
such
a
goddess
fortunately
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
promenade
and
as
they
paused
at
the
balustrade
nell
and
lord
vernon
joined
them
saving
susie
from
a
situation
which
had
slipped
entirely
beyond
her
control
evidently
nell
too
had
been
having
her
difficulties
for
she
telegraphed
her
sister
a
desire
to
change
places
so
on
the
homeward
journey
despite
the
very
apparent
unwillingness
of
the
men
sue
walked
beside
the
invalid
chair
and
nell
accompanied
the
prince
and
while
both
seemed
gay
enough
even
unnaturally
gay
perhaps
i
dare
say
they
found
that
the
situation
had
lost
a
certain
interest
for
every
danger
has
its
fascination
every
hazard
its
piquancy
i
am
not
sure
observed
susie
reflectively
as
they
went
up
the
stair
together
that
i
approve
of
princes
they
are
too
they
carry
things
with
too
high
a
hand
they
are
evidently
too
much
accustomed
to
having
their
own
way
it
seems
to
be
a
characteristic
of
lords
also
said
nell
with
a
little
sigh
what
they
need
is
a
vigorous
calling
down
well
that
ought
not
to
be
so
difficult
and
the
dark
eyes
snapped
ominously
though
perhaps
it
hardly
worth
the
trouble
suggested
nell
perhaps
not
assented
her
sister
but
half
an
hour
later
she
waylaid
her
father
to
give
him
her
commands
dad
she
said
if
the
prince
of
markeld
asks
you
for
permission
to
call
you
tell
him
he
may
just
one
of
these
odious
old
world
customs
so
i
judged
smiled
her
father
he
seems
a
nice
fellow
and
so
when
he
asked
me
ten
minutes
ago
i
told
him
we
be
glad
to
see
him
did
did
he
mention
any
particular
time
faltered
sue
why
yes
now
i
think
of
it
i
believe
he
said
something
about
this
evening
oh
gasped
susie
and
then
closed
her
lips
tightly
together
well
she
said
to
herself
as
she
turned
away
he
has
lost
any
time
to
be
sure
i
afraid
he
worse
than
i
thought
chapter
xii
events
of
the
night
life
at
as
at
most
other
places
of
its
class
swung
in
a
round
prescribed
by
custom
as
fixed
and
predestined
as
the
courses
of
the
stars
in
the
late
morning
occurred
the
promenade
taken
as
a
brisk
constitutional
by
a
few
but
by
the
great
majority
as
a
languid
stroll
designed
to
create
an
appetite
for
luncheon
that
meal
was
followed
by
a
period
of
torpor
then
every
one
sought
the
beach
the
high
the
low
the
rich
the
poor
the
dowdy
and
the
the
virgin
in
white
and
the
cocotte
in
scarlet
the
thin
and
the
obese
the
french
the
dutch
the
italian
yea
and
the
angular
english
for
attracted
a
crowd
as
hybrid
as
its
name
there
they
amused
themselves
each
after
his
own
fashion
with
dignity
or
abandon
as
the
case
might
be
they
could
not
be
said
to
mingle
in
the
way
that
an
american
crowd
would
have
done
under
like
circumstances
the
elements
of
society
in
an
aristocratic
country
are
as
incapable
of
mingling
as
oil
and
water
the
oil
floated
placidly
on
top
while
the
water
disported
itself
contentedly
beneath
the
oil
to
preserve
the
simile
consisted
in
the
first
place
of
a
number
of
individuals
stalking
solemnly
up
and
down
seemingly
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
they
were
not
as
solitary
as
crusoe
and
in
the
second
place
of
certain
solid
cohesive
groups
presenting
to
the
world
a
front
as
impenetrable
and
threatening
as
any
austrian
phalanx
and
guarding
in
their
midst
two
or
three
young
girls
who
must
at
any
hazard
be
kept
unspotted
from
the
world
strange
to
say
the
girls
appeared
contented
even
happy
the
position
seemed
to
them
no
doubt
the
normal
one
for
them
to
occupy
and
they
could
of
course
look
forward
with
certainty
to
the
opening
of
the
prison
door
when
a
marriage
should
be
arranged
for
them
they
order
this
matter
better
in
europe
or
at
least
differently
for
there
as
a
discerning
observer
has
pointed
out
marriage
means
always
that
a
woman
is
taken
down
from
the
shelf
while
with
us
alas
too
often
that
she
is
placed
upon
it
never
to
be
removed
to
this
class
too
belonged
certain
obese
women
and
emaciated
men
sitting
in
couples
under
the
gay
sunshades
with
which
the
beach
was
bright
the
women
were
dressed
always
in
gowns
which
however
ornate
were
not
quite
new
not
quite
fresh
not
quite
clean
and
the
black
coats
of
the
men
were
a
little
shiny
at
the
elbow
a
little
faded
at
the
seams
but
madame
still
took
care
to
preserve
such
figure
as
unkind
fate
had
left
her
and
monsieur
still
kept
his
moustaches
waxed
to
a
point
and
they
sat
there
together
quite
immovable
for
hours
at
a
time
staring
drearily
out
toward
the
horizon
meditating
no
doubt
over
past
glories
or
arranging
some
coup
by
which
their
fortunes
might
be
retrieved
pride
will
slip
from
them
gradually
as
the
years
pass
madame
will
abandon
her
figure
and
monsieur
his
moustaches
and
they
will
end
their
days
miserably
in
some
or
pension
even
perhaps
the
maison
vauquer
the
water
was
more
interesting
being
at
once
more
natural
and
lively
with
it
there
was
no
question
of
maintaining
the
equilibrium
of
its
position
there
was
no
need
of
air
or
artifice
there
was
none
of
that
heartburning
with
which
the
latest
pontifical
princess
smilingly
swallows
the
insolence
of
the
descendant
à
la
main
gauche
of
the
great
henri
happy
to
have
been
noticed
even
though
to
be
noticed
meant
inevitably
to
be
snubbed
there
was
a
freedom
about
the
water
an
honest
vulgarity
a
quality
as
of
rabelais
refreshingly
in
contrast
with
the
manners
and
morals
of
the
haute
noblesse
madame
need
not
hesitate
to
cross
her
legs
if
she
found
that
attitude
comfortable
monsieur
could
at
once
remove
coat
collar
cuffs
if
he
found
the
weather
warm
families
whose
size
testified
to
their
bourgeois
respectability
lolled
in
happy
promiscuity
upon
the
sands
the
children
constructed
forts
or
canals
the
women
tore
some
neighbour
reputation
to
pieces
the
men
lay
back
lazily
and
smoked
and
kept
an
eye
out
for
the
bathers
there
were
always
many
scores
of
them
belonging
principally
to
that
strange
and
tragic
which
hangs
suspended
like
coffin
between
earth
and
heaven
or
at
least
between
mass
and
class
and
which
stretches
out
its
tentacles
and
sucks
nourishment
from
both
these
with
a
regularity
almost
religious
spent
an
hour
of
every
day
weather
permitting
splashing
in
the
gentle
surf
or
posing
on
the
beach
in
costumes
more
or
less
revealing
according
to
the
contour
of
the
wearer
the
climax
of
the
afternoon
the
which
all
awaited
was
the
appearance
of
mlle
paul
late
of
the
variétés
this
was
such
a
masterpiece
in
its
way
that
it
is
worth
pausing
a
moment
to
describe
suddenly
the
door
of
her
which
has
been
drawn
just
to
the
water
edge
is
flung
open
and
she
appears
on
the
threshold
wrapped
in
a
white
sheet
with
a
red
border
producing
a
effect
not
ungraceful
she
hesitates
an
instant
and
casts
a
startled
glance
over
the
crowd
of
onlookers
then
trips
modestly
down
the
steps
with
a
little
frisson
she
casts
the
sheet
from
her
and
stands
revealed
well
perhaps
not
quite
as
eve
was
to
adam
but
so
nearly
so
that
the
difference
is
scarcely
worth
remarking
she
glances
down
at
her
shapely
legs
and
then
again
at
the
entranced
spectators
convenable
hein
she
murmurs
and
her
cicisbeo
who
has
taken
possession
of
her
sheet
hastens
to
assure
her
that
all
is
well
whereupon
her
doubts
thus
happily
set
at
rest
she
wades
out
to
the
mounts
it
leisurely
stands
poised
for
an
instant
at
the
outermost
end
and
then
dives
gracefully
into
the
expectant
billows
this
she
does
at
intervals
for
perhaps
an
hour
the
supreme
instant
for
the
onlookers
being
that
in
which
her
glowing
body
shimmering
white
through
its
single
clinging
garment
is
outlined
in
against
the
sky
but
finally
mademoiselle
grows
weary
and
returns
to
her
machine
where
the
gallant
and
attentive
gentleman
previously
referred
to
patiently
awaits
her
deus
ex
machina
in
more
senses
than
one
the
other
bathers
gradually
disappear
and
the
crowd
melts
imperceptibly
away
the
show
is
over
but
though
all
this
was
no
doubt
sufficiently
diverting
was
never
gloriously
aggressively
awake
until
the
sun
went
down
the
diversions
of
the
day
depended
wholly
upon
the
weather
a
dash
of
rain
a
wind
from
the
north
and
pouf
they
were
not
thought
of
not
so
the
festivities
of
the
night
nothing
short
of
an
earthquake
could
interfere
with
them
it
was
for
the
night
that
most
of
the
sojourners
at
existed
it
was
for
them
in
turn
that
the
place
itself
existed
with
these
worthies
the
first
serious
business
of
the
day
was
dressing
for
dinner
as
darkness
came
a
stir
of
life
thrilled
through
the
place
from
end
to
end
rows
and
clusters
of
electric
lights
and
flashed
out
at
the
casino
in
the
hotels
along
the
digue
women
donned
their
evening
gowns
thankful
for
handsome
shoulders
got
out
their
diamonds
real
and
paste
their
rouge
cosmetics
what
not
prepared
to
go
forth
and
conquer
to
play
the
old
old
game
which
by
the
calm
light
of
the
morning
seems
so
flat
and
savourless
oh
what
would
it
be
without
wine
and
lights
and
jewels
and
soft
gowns
without
warmth
and
music
and
perfume
without
the
suggestive
sensual
darkness
closing
it
in
at
the
casino
presently
spins
the
wheel
of
fortune
named
in
very
mockery
and
it
is
there
that
one
may
gaze
unrebuked
into
the
most
alluring
eyes
may
see
the
reddest
lips
and
whitest
shoulders
crème
de
la
crème
of
all
in
that
smaller
room
upstairs
arranged
for
those
whose
jaded
appetites
demand
some
extra
tickling
where
no
wager
may
be
laid
for
less
than
a
hundred
francs
and
for
as
much
more
as
you
please
monsieur
madame
provided
only
that
you
have
it
with
you
too
bad
that
the
immortal
soul
has
no
longer
a
money
value
or
how
many
would
ornament
that
crowded
table
in
the
course
of
an
evening
play
but
there
let
a
single
glimpse
of
this
tawdry
perfumed
fevered
hell
suffice
us
even
as
it
did
archibald
rushford
on
the
first
night
of
his
stay
at
and
let
us
go
out
as
he
did
into
the
pure
night
and
stand
uncovered
under
the
bright
stars
until
the
cool
breeze
from
the
ocean
has
washed
us
clean
again
and
turning
our
backs
forever
upon
the
casino
and
its
habitués
retrace
our
steps
along
the
digue
to
the
grand
hôtel
royal
in
apartment
a
de
luxe
a
man
with
flushed
face
and
rumpled
hair
was
stamping
nervously
up
and
down
it
required
a
second
glance
to
recognise
in
him
that
usually
and
individual
known
as
lord
vernon
two
others
were
watching
his
movements
with
scarcely
concealed
anxiety
collins
leaning
against
the
window
with
folded
arms
blake
seated
at
a
table
with
an
open
before
him
hang
it
all
fellows
he
was
saying
do
you
see
what
a
pickle
it
puts
me
in
i
was
a
fool
to
fall
in
with
the
idea
i
was
actually
silly
enough
to
think
it
would
be
fun
of
course
put
in
collins
in
his
smoothest
tone
nobody
could
foresee
the
presence
of
this
american
diana
vernon
shot
him
a
quick
glance
be
mighty
careful
what
you
say
my
friend
he
warned
him
or
chuck
the
whole
thing
oh
you
ca
do
that
protested
blake
you
got
to
carry
it
through
you
ca
back
out
now
ca
i
said
vernon
with
a
grim
little
laugh
do
be
too
certain
suppose
she
finds
it
out
pretty
figure
i
cut
wo
i
but
how
she
find
it
out
in
four
or
five
days
you
can
tell
her
the
whole
story
you
figure
as
a
sort
of
hero
of
romance
yes
romance
backstairs
romance
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
less
i
like
it
diplomacy
or
no
diplomacy
we
playing
markeld
a
dirty
trick
that
the
only
expression
that
describes
it
he
a
nice
fellow
and
we
ought
to
treat
him
fairly
collins
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
turned
away
to
the
window
and
lighted
a
cigarette
you
said
something
of
the
same
sort
yesterday
i
believe
he
remarked
negligently
yes
and
i
meant
it
then
as
i
mean
it
now
markeld
has
the
right
to
expect
decent
treatment
at
our
hands
rather
late
in
the
day
to
take
that
ground
retorted
collins
late
or
not
i
do
take
it
answered
vernon
pausing
an
instant
in
his
walk
to
emphasise
the
words
i
see
said
collins
drily
it
a
sort
of
moral
awakening
a
quickening
of
conscience
the
kind
of
thing
we
are
all
so
proud
of
displaying
pity
it
did
come
before
we
started
for
this
place
vernon
did
not
reply
only
clasped
and
unclasped
his
hands
nervously
collins
wheeled
around
upon
him
abruptly
his
face
very
stern
come
he
demanded
let
have
it
out
once
for
all
i
sick
of
this
why
ca
you
let
markeld
take
care
of
himself
because
you
not
playing
fairly
what
do
you
mean
by
fairly
i
mean
openly
honestly
as
gentlemen
should
you
forget
that
this
is
diplomacy
and
that
we
do
live
in
the
golden
age
we
fight
with
such
weapons
as
come
to
hand
it
the
game
yes
as
you
understand
it
a
gang
of
cutthroats
might
say
the
same
thing
collins
flushed
a
little
but
managed
to
keep
his
temper
i
understand
it
as
all
diplomats
understand
it
i
take
no
advantage
that
every
diplomat
would
not
take
then
god
save
me
from
diplomats
retorted
vernon
collins
flushed
again
more
deeply
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
sudden
fire
your
words
verge
upon
the
insulting
he
said
after
a
moment
i
warn
you
not
to
try
my
patience
too
far
perhaps
after
this
you
will
see
fit
to
choose
other
company
company
more
in
accord
with
your
really
absurd
ideals
but
i
would
remind
you
of
one
thing
your
career
depends
upon
this
affair
if
it
succeeds
you
succeed
if
it
fails
through
any
fault
of
yours
you
are
ruined
i
assure
you
the
fault
will
not
be
overlooked
nor
extenuated
you
will
pay
for
it
vernon
looked
at
him
without
answering
but
his
glance
was
full
of
meaning
then
he
turned
and
left
the
room
for
a
moment
his
companions
stared
after
him
they
had
read
his
glance
aright
we
have
to
look
sharp
said
collins
at
last
or
he
cause
us
trouble
he
ripe
for
it
confound
him
we
better
wire
the
home
office
to
hurry
things
up
yes
agreed
blake
there
no
reasoning
with
a
man
in
love
nor
frightening
him
added
collins
i
afraid
i
made
a
mistake
taking
that
tack
i
go
down
and
get
off
a
message
as
he
opened
the
door
he
fancied
that
a
figure
melted
into
the
shadow
at
the
end
of
the
hall
but
his
attention
was
distracted
from
it
for
an
instant
later
he
heard
a
step
on
the
stair
and
the
prince
of
markeld
mounted
from
the
floor
below
passed
him
with
the
slightest
possible
inclination
of
the
head
and
continued
upward
collins
staring
after
him
standing
still
as
death
heard
him
enter
the
apartment
of
the
rushfords
he
remained
a
moment
where
he
was
his
heart
heavy
with
foreboding
then
he
descended
slowly
to
the
office
his
head
bent
deep
in
thought
so
preoccupied
was
he
that
he
did
not
see
the
sleek
face
which
leered
at
him
from
the
shadow
into
which
the
dim
figure
had
vanished
the
spy
listened
a
moment
intently
then
with
a
tread
soft
as
a
cat
mounted
the
stair
to
the
floor
above
of
course
dad
susie
had
said
in
the
early
evening
you
will
have
to
stay
at
home
since
the
prince
is
coming
to
see
you
oh
it
not
i
he
coming
to
see
rejoined
rushford
easily
in
fact
he
probably
be
tickled
to
death
to
find
me
out
he
not
going
to
find
you
out
retorted
susie
firmly
you
going
to
stay
right
here
nonsense
my
dear
why
when
i
was
courting
your
mother
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
demanded
sue
very
crimson
do
you
mean
to
say
that
someone
is
courting
someone
around
here
of
course
every
man
may
be
mistaken
at
times
well
take
my
word
for
it
you
badly
mistaken
this
time
oh
said
her
father
with
assumed
astonishment
am
i
then
what
is
all
this
about
and
even
if
they
were
continued
susie
a
little
unsteadily
they
do
it
differently
from
the
american
way
how
do
they
do
it
for
heaven
sake
why
dad
how
should
i
know
you
seem
to
have
considerable
information
on
the
subject
i
have
enough
information
to
know
retorted
sue
with
some
heat
that
in
europe
a
young
man
calls
upon
the
head
of
the
family
and
not
upon
any
of
its
younger
female
members
i
have
always
understood
that
europe
was
behind
the
times
observed
her
father
but
i
never
suspected
it
was
as
bad
as
that
however
i
take
your
word
for
it
i
always
do
you
know
i
suppose
you
and
nell
will
have
to
stay
in
your
rooms
oh
no
said
sue
we
may
be
present
so
long
as
our
chaperon
is
there
so
i
to
do
some
chaperoning
at
last
am
i
queried
her
father
the
job
has
ceased
to
be
a
sinecure
i
suppose
i
have
to
do
all
the
talking
since
young
girls
of
course
may
only
speak
when
spoken
to
and
then
must
answer
with
a
yes
or
no
really
my
dear
you
setting
yourself
an
exceedingly
difficult
part
where
did
you
learn
so
much
about
it
dad
i
reasoning
by
deduction
all
this
follows
from
what
you
already
told
me
well
i
do
my
best
to
entertain
this
dutchman
what
does
he
talk
about
and
sauerkraut
oh
no
said
susie
with
a
reminiscent
smile
and
a
heightened
colour
he
talks
about
things
much
more
interesting
than
those
and
indeed
the
first
moments
past
rushford
found
the
prince
an
entertaining
fellow
with
a
fund
of
anecdote
and
experience
decidedly
unusual
but
conversations
of
this
sort
are
rarely
worth
recording
the
less
so
in
this
instance
since
the
prince
had
taken
care
to
seat
himself
where
he
had
a
good
view
of
the
enchanting
susie
and
that
vision
more
than
once
caused
his
thoughts
to
wander
still
they
discussed
america
and
europe
art
nature
the
universe
none
of
which
has
anything
to
do
with
this
story
everything
in
short
except
the
warm
palpitating
human
heart
with
which
we
are
principally
concerned
and
it
was
very
late
before
the
prince
finally
arose
to
go
sue
whispered
her
thanks
as
she
kissed
her
father
good
old
daddy
she
said
and
patted
him
on
the
cheek
and
it
such
a
trial
after
all
was
it
her
father
looked
down
at
her
quizzically
no
my
dear
he
answered
in
fact
i
rather
enjoyed
it
i
fancy
be
a
mighty
interesting
talker
if
there
were
any
distractions
around
not
that
i
blame
him
he
added
hastily
i
was
that
way
myself
once
upon
a
time
and
he
bent
and
kissed
her
tenderly
again
susie
before
her
glass
stared
at
herself
long
and
earnestly
then
took
down
her
hair
and
proceeded
to
arrange
it
in
various
ways
at
last
she
got
out
a
diamond
bracelet
placed
it
upon
her
head
and
studied
the
effect
she
was
thus
engaged
when
an
agitated
tap
at
the
door
gave
her
a
mighty
start
and
she
had
just
time
to
snatch
off
the
decoration
when
nell
burst
in
her
face
white
with
emotion
why
what
is
it
nellie
cried
her
sister
springing
up
i
i
lost
it
gasped
nell
sinking
limply
into
a
chair
and
trembling
convulsively
i
sure
it
been
stolen
lost
it
echoed
sue
reviewing
in
one
quick
mental
flash
nell
most
valuable
possessions
not
the
diamond
necklace
oh
sue
wailed
nell
how
can
you
be
so
mercenary
oh
i
wish
it
was
the
necklace
but
it
is
it
the
note
it
was
sue
turn
to
gasp
to
turn
pale
to
sink
into
a
chair
the
note
she
echoed
hoarsely
not
lord
vernon
nell
nodded
mutely
her
face
a
study
for
the
tragic
muse
but
i
thought
you
destroyed
it
said
sue
you
said
you
were
going
to
i
know
but
i
did
answered
nell
a
faint
tinge
of
pink
in
her
pallid
cheeks
i
i
did
see
the
need
of
destroying
it
i
supposed
nobody
knew
and
i
i
thought
i
keep
it
as
a
a
souvenir
you
know
i
had
it
in
my
desk
i
am
sure
i
locked
it
before
i
came
down
this
evening
but
just
now
i
found
it
open
and
the
note
gone
well
and
what
did
you
do
then
i
looked
all
through
the
desk
i
thought
maybe
it
had
slipped
out
of
sight
somehow
but
it
had
it
was
there
then
i
called
the
maid
julie
and
told
her
something
had
been
stolen
she
swore
no
one
had
entered
the
room
since
i
left
it
that
no
one
could
have
entered
it
of
course
i
could
tell
her
about
the
note
so
i
sent
her
away
and
came
to
you
i
i
feel
like
a
traitor
i
do
know
what
to
do
susie
went
to
her
and
put
her
arms
about
her
and
drew
her
close
we
ca
do
anything
dear
she
said
that
certain
you
must
tell
lord
vernon
she
felt
nell
quiver
at
the
words
and
drew
her
closer
still
with
intimate
understanding
i
do
believe
he
will
care
so
much
she
went
on
comfortingly
perhaps
the
note
is
so
important
as
we
think
i
suppose
we
should
have
destroyed
it
at
once
yes
said
nell
drearily
i
suppose
we
should
but
who
could
have
foreseen
anything
like
this
the
best
thing
to
do
now
is
to
go
to
bed
added
sue
practically
and
she
raised
her
sister
and
led
her
back
to
her
room
in
the
morning
we
can
make
a
thorough
search
for
the
note
perhaps
after
all
you
overlooked
it
i
could
have
overlooked
it
answered
nell
i
remember
perfectly
placing
it
in
this
drawer
she
continued
going
to
the
desk
and
opening
it
here
just
under
this
pile
of
perhaps
it
slipped
in
between
the
sheets
suggested
sue
i
thought
of
that
said
nell
but
nevertheless
she
began
mechanically
to
open
sheet
after
sheet
as
she
opened
the
third
one
a
little
slip
of
paper
fluttered
to
the
floor
she
sprang
upon
it
with
a
cry
of
joy
opened
it
glanced
at
it
thank
god
she
said
thickly
it
all
right
it
and
she
fell
forward
into
susie
arms
chapter
xiii
the
second
promenade
again
the
sun
rose
clear
and
bright
and
again
having
dispelled
the
mist
and
chill
of
the
early
morning
it
lured
forth
for
the
inevitable
promenade
such
of
the
sojourners
at
as
had
managed
to
get
to
bed
before
dawn
prince
markeld
descending
with
the
earliest
left
nothing
this
time
to
chance
but
took
his
station
at
the
stairfoot
and
waited
there
with
a
patience
really
exemplary
from
which
it
will
be
seen
that
princes
in
love
are
much
as
other
men
and
presently
descending
toward
him
he
descried
the
misses
rushford
susie
radiant
as
the
morning
nell
a
trifle
paler
than
her
wont
but
more
beautiful
if
anything
because
of
it
the
prince
hastened
forward
to
greet
them
which
way
shall
we
go
he
asked
with
the
comfortable
certainty
of
including
himself
in
their
plans
he
added
to
the
occupant
of
an
invalid
chair
which
was
standing
just
outside
the
door
replied
lord
vernon
his
eyes
on
nell
my
outing
yesterday
was
such
a
pleasant
one
that
i
was
hoping
it
might
be
repeated
going
or
coming
queried
sue
with
a
quizzical
curve
of
the
lips
both
ways
answered
vernon
promptly
but
his
eyes
were
still
on
nell
markeld
also
looked
excellently
satisfied
very
well
he
said
in
his
autocratic
way
we
will
proceed
as
we
did
yesterday
and
he
led
susie
away
strange
to
relate
she
followed
quite
meekly
somehow
when
the
moment
came
it
seemed
exceedingly
difficult
to
snub
him
do
you
know
he
was
saying
i
fell
quite
in
love
with
your
father
last
night
his
point
of
view
is
so
fresh
and
so
full
of
humour
though
he
added
i
must
confess
that
sometimes
i
did
not
entirely
understand
him
did
you
laughed
susie
dad
use
a
good
deal
of
slang
an
american
failing
so
i
have
heard
i
know
my
aunt
will
like
him
too
the
dowager
duchess
of
markheim
you
know
no
said
sue
a
little
faintly
i
did
know
she
had
never
before
considered
the
possibility
of
the
prince
having
any
women
relatives
her
heart
fell
as
she
thought
what
dreadful
creatures
they
would
probably
prove
to
be
my
aunt
is
the
head
of
the
family
explained
the
prince
calmly
unconscious
of
his
companion
perturbation
she
rules
us
with
a
rod
of
iron
but
you
will
like
her
and
i
know
she
will
like
you
she
adores
anything
with
fire
in
it
oh
said
susie
to
herself
and
how
does
he
know
i
any
fire
in
me
but
she
judged
it
wisest
not
to
utter
the
question
aloud
she
worships
spirit
added
the
prince
she
is
very
fond
of
quoting
a
line
of
your
poet
browning
have
i
on
earth
to
do
she
will
demand
the
slothful
with
the
mawkish
the
unmanly
sometimes
i
fear
she
aims
the
adjectives
at
me
susie
felt
her
heart
softening
for
she
liked
that
line
too
i
do
believe
you
deserve
the
adjectives
she
said
do
you
not
he
asked
eagerly
with
brightened
eyes
and
i
should
like
to
meet
your
aunt
she
continued
hastily
so
you
shall
most
certainly
he
assented
instantly
as
soon
as
it
can
be
arranged
oh
does
it
have
to
be
arranged
inquired
susie
in
some
dismay
not
in
that
sense
she
is
very
democratic
she
likes
people
for
what
they
are
but
until
this
question
of
the
succession
is
concluded
you
will
readily
understand
that
through
anxiety
she
is
not
in
the
best
of
humours
not
quite
herself
is
she
then
here
asked
susie
here
oh
no
she
is
at
markheim
at
the
post
of
duty
that
is
another
reason
until
this
affair
is
settled
i
can
not
ask
her
to
join
me
here
you
will
ask
her
to
do
that
certainly
she
can
stop
here
very
well
on
her
way
to
ostend
she
would
be
at
ostend
now
but
for
this
affair
perhaps
that
is
another
reason
why
she
is
she
is
so
fond
of
life
and
gaiety
and
in
summer
markheim
is
rather
dull
besides
there
is
the
tradition
to
maintain
how
do
you
know
that
she
is
in
an
questioned
sue
if
you
have
not
seen
her
oh
she
writes
to
me
i
had
a
letter
from
her
this
morning
i
can
see
she
is
not
quite
the
opposite
in
fact
at
the
way
things
are
going
and
how
are
they
going
they
seem
to
be
going
against
us
said
the
prince
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
how
they
be
i
thought
things
were
at
a
until
lord
vernon
got
got
well
enough
to
take
them
up
again
so
did
i
that
is
what
one
would
naturally
suppose
yet
it
seems
that
an
undercurrent
has
set
in
against
us
i
fear
that
i
made
a
mistake
he
added
gloomily
in
agreeing
with
lord
vernon
not
to
proceed
further
for
a
week
though
under
the
circumstances
i
could
scarcely
refuse
he
seems
well
enough
and
he
glanced
around
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
he
well
enough
cried
sue
indignantly
and
certainly
at
that
moment
talking
eagerly
to
nell
that
gentleman
appeared
quite
the
reverse
of
an
invalid
will
speak
to
him
i
am
under
no
promise
i
believe
she
stopped
fearing
that
she
might
say
too
much
after
all
she
could
not
betray
lord
vernon
she
could
only
appeal
to
him
warn
him
yes
her
companion
encouraged
her
his
eyes
on
her
face
i
believe
that
i
can
help
you
she
concluded
a
little
lamely
i
want
to
help
the
people
of
course
we
americans
believe
that
a
people
ought
to
choose
their
own
rulers
but
where
that
is
possible
the
next
best
thing
is
to
give
them
the
best
available
i
should
be
proud
to
help
do
that
but
you
are
taking
my
word
for
it
he
protested
you
ought
to
hear
the
other
side
perhaps
they
might
convince
you
no
they
would
cried
susie
your
word
is
all
i
need
explained
things
so
clearly
thank
you
he
said
in
a
vibrant
voice
still
looking
at
her
besides
she
added
with
a
glance
upward
dad
agrees
with
you
and
i
a
great
deal
of
faith
in
dad
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
help
on
any
terms
he
said
refusing
to
be
cast
down
and
you
will
tell
me
if
anything
unexpected
happens
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
more
than
you
think
yes
he
promised
i
will
tell
you
the
moment
i
have
any
news
you
have
any
real
news
about
the
undercurrent
i
mean
you
know
no
it
is
just
in
the
air
i
do
not
know
where
the
rumours
come
from
but
my
aunt
has
heard
them
also
there
is
a
vague
impression
that
we
are
losing
but
you
sha
lose
cried
susie
you
sha
lose
not
even
if
i
have
to
to
not
even
if
you
have
to
prompted
the
prince
eagerly
as
she
stammered
and
stopped
to
play
my
trump
card
she
finished
with
a
little
unsteady
laugh
do
ask
me
what
it
is
but
it
a
good
one
meanwhile
as
she
walked
beside
the
invalid
chair
nell
was
making
her
confession
lord
vernon
she
began
in
a
low
voice
for
a
time
last
night
i
feared
that
i
had
utterly
ruined
your
cause
he
glanced
up
at
her
quickly
in
what
way
he
asked
you
remember
the
note
you
wrote
m
us
the
first
day
perfectly
he
answered
noting
the
stammer
and
understanding
it
with
a
quick
leap
of
the
heart
i
should
no
doubt
have
destroyed
it
at
once
but
i
thought
it
would
be
perfectly
safe
in
my
desk
and
it
was
stolen
no
matter
miss
rushford
it
is
worth
worrying
about
i
sick
of
the
whole
affair
anyway
i
shall
rather
welcome
the
catastrophe
you
lost
sleep
over
it
he
continued
looking
at
her
keenly
it
has
made
you
almost
ill
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
thank
you
she
said
softly
her
lips
trembling
her
eyes
very
bright
it
is
beautiful
of
you
to
be
so
generous
but
fortunately
the
note
was
not
stolen
i
found
it
afterwards
among
some
where
it
had
somehow
found
its
way
and
you
destroyed
it
no
she
said
and
took
it
from
her
bosom
i
thought
i
would
better
restore
it
to
you
so
that
you
yourself
could
destroy
it
here
it
is
and
she
held
it
out
to
him
with
fingers
not
wholly
steady
he
took
it
his
eyes
still
on
her
face
it
has
caused
us
enough
trouble
he
said
and
made
as
though
to
tear
it
into
bits
but
nell
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
without
looking
at
it
she
protested
you
are
right
he
agreed
and
opened
it
and
glanced
at
the
contents
his
hands
were
trembling
slightly
as
he
folded
it
again
on
second
thought
he
said
and
there
was
a
certain
thickness
in
the
words
which
nell
was
too
agitated
to
notice
i
believe
that
i
shall
keep
it
it
is
the
only
souvenir
i
have
you
know
of
our
first
meeting
and
he
smiled
up
at
her
such
a
smile
as
meïamoun
must
have
bent
upon
cleopatra
as
he
drained
the
poisoned
cup
chapter
xiv
a
bearding
of
the
lion
susie
rushford
was
of
that
temperament
which
so
far
from
avoiding
difficulties
rather
rushes
to
meet
them
welcoming
each
rebuff
that
turns
earth
smoothness
rough
to
quote
again
from
her
favourite
poet
so
when
they
reached
the
end
of
the
promenade
it
was
she
who
commanded
a
change
of
partners
and
who
took
her
place
resolutely
beside
the
invalid
chair
perhaps
lord
vernon
scented
danger
or
it
may
be
that
he
merely
resented
the
change
of
companions
at
any
rate
as
they
started
back
he
contented
himself
with
a
dignified
silence
but
sue
was
not
to
be
so
easily
put
off
the
prince
of
markeld
has
been
telling
me
a
few
things
about
the
succession
she
began
resolutely
you
will
pardon
me
lord
vernon
when
i
say
i
do
think
you
treating
him
quite
fairly
i
do
think
so
myself
miss
rushford
returned
the
occupant
of
the
chair
curtly
his
branch
of
the
house
seems
to
be
really
in
every
way
the
more
deserving
i
have
the
least
doubt
of
it
and
the
one
which
the
people
of
prefer
that
too
is
very
probably
the
case
we
threshed
all
that
out
yesterday
did
we
not
so
thoroughly
as
i
should
like
to
do
said
susie
i
been
thinking
over
the
story
you
told
me
yesterday
and
i
believe
guessed
who
the
man
with
the
pistol
is
i
thought
very
probably
you
would
guess
did
you
then
you
wo
mind
telling
me
if
i
guessed
rightly
the
german
emperor
is
it
it
is
thank
you
but
i
awfully
obtuse
for
i
must
confess
that
i
as
yet
been
able
to
perceive
the
pistol
have
you
i
thought
you
guess
that
too
i
had
forgotten
that
american
women
are
interested
in
public
events
now
you
growing
sarcastic
cried
susie
you
see
i
never
before
knew
how
interesting
they
were
she
added
in
i
trying
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
you
want
my
help
i
always
like
to
understand
things
even
as
a
child
i
hated
riddles
and
i
think
too
that
nations
ought
to
be
like
individuals
only
more
so
always
ready
anxious
even
to
help
their
friends
even
to
the
point
of
disregarding
the
pistol
you
have
to
show
me
the
pistol
i
try
to
miss
rushford
said
vernon
with
the
air
of
a
man
staking
his
last
louis
since
you
seem
to
doubt
that
it
exists
let
us
look
at
the
matter
for
a
moment
from
the
outside
without
question
of
our
personal
likes
or
dislikes
england
just
at
this
moment
has
her
hands
full
in
south
africa
and
it
is
in
the
least
unlikely
that
the
german
emperor
would
put
a
finger
in
that
pie
if
we
gave
him
an
excuse
a
great
many
of
his
advisers
are
trying
to
get
him
to
interfere
without
waiting
for
the
excuse
but
he
not
quite
willing
to
go
that
far
so
our
business
is
not
to
give
him
any
excuse
not
even
the
very
slightest
suppose
we
meddle
in
this
affair
of
which
is
really
his
dependency
do
you
see
he
might
easily
and
quite
logically
claim
that
as
a
precedent
for
meddling
in
the
affairs
of
the
transvaal
which
we
claim
as
our
dependency
now
i
hope
that
you
perceive
the
pistol
and
see
too
that
it
is
in
the
least
a
toy
affair
but
a
very
dangerous
and
effective
weapon
i
do
see
said
susie
quickly
besides
vernon
added
anxious
to
vindicate
himself
still
further
since
after
all
susie
was
nell
sister
is
a
very
insignificant
corner
of
this
earth
not
so
big
in
fact
as
many
of
our
english
shires
is
the
first
law
of
nations
why
should
england
imperil
herself
you
see
the
whole
question
reduces
itself
to
that
old
heartless
but
very
sane
doctrine
of
the
greatest
good
of
the
greatest
number
why
not
say
all
that
frankly
to
the
prince
of
markeld
suggested
sue
because
my
dear
young
lady
before
we
can
say
anything
we
have
to
give
him
a
chance
to
say
his
say
and
he
would
very
probably
state
certain
truths
which
it
would
be
very
embarrassing
for
us
to
hear
and
still
more
embarrassing
to
answer
all
europe
would
be
listening
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
well
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
asked
susie
plump
out
we
going
to
wait
said
lord
vernon
gloomily
to
wait
yes
until
the
sea
subsides
a
little
or
the
devil
gets
tired
and
goes
away
and
gives
us
a
chance
to
escape
we
dare
neither
fight
the
devil
nor
brave
the
ocean
our
hands
are
tied
susie
walked
along
a
moment
in
silence
trying
to
distinguish
the
wrong
and
the
right
of
this
very
intricate
question
all
that
you
have
been
telling
me
may
be
true
she
said
at
last
i
have
the
least
doubt
that
it
is
true
but
yet
it
does
quite
excuse
tricking
the
prince
of
markeld
as
you
are
doing
i
know
it
does
admitted
vernon
instantly
it
does
excuse
it
in
the
least
i
do
like
it
any
more
than
you
do
miss
rushford
but
the
ways
of
diplomacy
are
devious
past
understanding
and
then
again
when
one
has
entered
upon
a
line
of
action
it
is
sometimes
very
hard
to
change
it
or
let
go
it
like
a
hot
iron
or
a
charged
wire
one
never
realises
one
mistake
until
it
is
too
late
after
all
a
few
days
will
end
it
a
few
days
then
the
prince
was
right
right
he
told
me
that
an
undercurrent
of
some
sort
seemed
to
be
setting
in
against
him
i
warn
you
lord
vernon
that
i
have
become
his
ally
even
to
the
point
of
giving
me
away
he
inquired
half
humourously
looking
at
her
in
evident
enjoyment
even
to
the
point
of
giving
you
away
if
you
do
play
fairly
she
answered
in
deadly
earnest
at
your
suggestion
he
consented
to
a
truce
for
a
week
it
was
collins
who
suggested
it
no
matter
it
is
all
the
same
the
proposal
came
from
your
side
one
ca
honourably
employ
a
truce
in
laying
mines
for
one
enemy
lord
vernon
was
looking
straight
ahead
there
was
now
no
trace
of
amusement
in
his
face
you
are
quite
right
miss
rushford
he
said
i
release
you
from
any
engagement
with
either
me
or
collins
to
keep
our
secret
let
me
tell
you
i
protested
more
than
once
but
i
no
longer
a
free
agent
in
regard
to
this
thing
and
i
have
to
see
it
through
the
very
worst
moment
of
all
was
when
markeld
came
up
to
my
rooms
and
apologised
for
suspecting
me
i
tell
you
i
felt
like
a
worm
and
a
particularly
nasty
one
at
that
it
will
be
my
turn
to
apologise
before
long
and
i
feel
quite
easy
in
my
conscience
till
i
do
susie
had
listened
and
had
stolen
a
glance
once
or
twice
at
his
set
face
there
could
be
no
doubting
his
utter
sincerity
and
it
softened
her
as
sincerity
always
softens
a
woman
of
course
she
said
more
gently
i
sha
give
you
away
unless
i
see
that
the
prince
is
being
treated
unfairly
let
things
drift
for
a
week
since
he
has
consented
to
a
truce
do
do
anything
against
him
the
words
were
spoken
almost
pleadingly
oh
it
is
i
who
will
do
anything
retorted
lord
vernon
sharply
i
not
quite
such
a
cur
as
that
do
you
understand
miss
rushford
the
thing
is
out
of
my
hands
is
quite
beyond
my
control
not
the
one
responsible
for
the
undercurrent
if
there
is
one
if
anything
happens
it
wo
be
through
any
act
of
mine
it
will
be
in
spite
of
me
but
i
thought
you
thought
the
foreign
secretary
was
the
whole
thing
well
he
is
there
a
dozen
other
members
of
the
cabinet
more
or
less
to
mix
in
and
when
all
said
the
premier
has
to
approve
and
after
that
the
queen
and
all
of
us
are
more
or
less
afraid
of
the
press
to
say
nothing
of
the
house
of
commons
where
the
opposition
is
always
trying
to
put
us
in
an
awkward
corner
so
our
motives
are
usually
pretty
mixed
and
it
very
rarely
that
we
can
do
just
as
we
like
to
do
then
said
susie
slowly
i
think
that
i
must
tell
the
prince
do
so
by
all
means
retorted
her
companion
a
little
impatiently
i
give
you
full
permission
if
you
care
to
take
the
responsibility
but
i
assure
you
it
a
heavy
one
oh
not
so
awfully
heavy
said
susie
sceptically
you
have
already
told
me
what
a
little
place
is
it
little
but
so
is
the
pivot
that
a
great
piece
of
machinery
swings
on
collins
said
yesterday
that
the
peace
of
europe
may
hang
upon
this
question
i
laughed
at
him
then
but
it
not
at
all
impossible
that
he
may
be
right
of
course
with
a
little
thing
like
the
peace
of
europe
every
schoolgirl
has
the
right
to
meddle
a
million
of
human
beings
more
or
less
what
do
they
amount
to
let
us
slaughter
them
maim
them
outrage
them
burn
their
houses
destroy
their
crops
let
us
put
great
armies
in
the
field
and
fight
great
battles
and
think
only
of
the
glory
do
look
at
the
shapeless
things
beneath
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
nor
think
of
the
women
waiting
at
home
waiting
for
the
lists
of
dead
and
missing
let
us
release
the
spring
that
will
set
all
this
in
motion
it
requires
only
a
touch
the
merest
touch
and
think
we
should
be
making
history
besides
our
honour
requires
it
we
must
be
jealous
of
our
honour
it
is
of
so
much
more
importance
than
the
peace
of
europe
and
vernon
having
arrived
at
the
hotel
entrance
bade
them
and
was
wheeled
to
the
lift
leaving
his
companion
rather
breathless
chapter
xv
be
bold
be
bold
lord
vernon
no
doubt
would
have
spoken
with
less
acerbity
but
for
the
fact
that
his
nerves
were
jangling
badly
the
lift
was
started
promptly
but
it
required
all
his
to
remain
seated
in
his
chair
during
the
slow
progress
upward
of
the
great
machine
of
which
monsieur
pelletan
was
so
proud
scarcely
had
the
door
of
his
apartment
closed
behind
him
when
he
threw
aside
the
invalid
wrappings
with
a
perfect
fury
sprang
from
his
chair
and
hastened
into
the
inner
room
collins
and
blake
were
seated
at
a
table
there
labouring
with
a
telegram
in
cipher
what
the
matter
now
demanded
collins
sharply
as
he
looked
up
and
saw
vernon
disordered
face
for
answer
vernon
took
from
his
pocket
a
folded
paper
and
tossed
it
on
the
table
collins
picked
it
up
opened
it
and
read
its
contents
well
he
said
looking
up
with
a
sigh
of
relief
if
this
is
the
note
you
wrote
those
rushford
girls
i
must
say
i
think
you
done
a
mighty
wise
thing
to
get
it
back
it
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
have
lying
around
have
you
had
a
quarrel
and
he
grinned
a
little
maliciously
collins
said
vernon
coldly
you
have
the
poorest
conception
of
good
taste
of
any
man
i
know
and
i
know
some
awful
bounders
but
i
quarrel
with
you
now
for
you
be
grinning
on
the
other
side
of
that
ugly
mouth
of
yours
anyway
in
about
a
minute
will
you
kindly
examine
this
piece
of
paper
and
he
tore
a
leaf
from
his
notebook
be
bold
be
bold
collins
biting
his
lips
until
they
bled
took
it
and
looked
it
over
with
frowning
and
puzzled
countenance
well
he
asked
at
last
the
note
i
sent
the
misses
rushford
said
vernon
quietly
was
written
on
a
leaf
from
the
notebook
which
i
tore
out
just
as
i
did
that
one
you
have
in
your
hand
and
he
sat
down
and
stared
out
the
window
across
the
gray
dunes
and
the
gray
sea
to
the
gray
horizon
collins
with
compressed
lips
held
the
two
pieces
of
paper
up
to
the
light
and
compared
their
texture
then
he
got
out
a
small
pocket
magnifying
glass
and
examined
through
it
the
writing
on
the
note
it
a
tracing
he
said
at
last
and
a
mighty
clever
piece
of
work
the
paper
too
is
very
like
but
it
not
the
same
put
in
vernon
oh
no
it
not
the
same
do
you
mean
this
is
a
forgery
burst
out
blake
hoarsely
snatching
up
the
note
and
staring
at
it
undoubtedly
answered
collins
coolly
but
his
face
was
very
dark
the
forger
clever
as
he
was
could
scarcely
expect
to
be
so
fortunate
as
to
duplicate
the
paper
and
then
of
course
he
could
foresee
that
it
would
be
turned
over
to
you
but
he
did
very
well
now
let
have
the
story
miss
rushford
had
the
note
in
her
desk
said
vernon
shortly
she
missed
it
last
night
and
went
to
tell
her
sister
of
the
theft
when
she
returned
to
her
room
and
began
a
systematic
search
she
found
it
slipped
among
some
in
the
drawer
where
she
had
placed
it
she
returned
it
to
me
this
morning
without
suspecting
that
it
was
a
forgery
certainly
and
you
did
tell
her
no
collins
sat
for
a
moment
staring
down
at
the
note
which
reminds
me
he
remarked
at
last
that
markeld
spent
the
evening
with
the
rushfords
well
what
of
it
demanded
vernon
sharply
wheeling
around
what
is
it
you
mean
to
insinuate
my
dear
sir
answered
collins
suavely
i
insinuate
nothing
i
was
merely
remarking
upon
the
coincidence
if
i
did
not
happen
to
know
all
the
circumstances
i
might
have
been
led
to
suggest
that
as
only
one
miss
rushford
is
devoted
to
you
vernon
sprang
to
his
feet
with
such
wrath
in
his
face
that
collins
stopped
abruptly
it
was
well
you
stopped
said
vernon
savagely
another
word
and
by
heaven
do
be
a
fool
collins
broke
in
i
not
afraid
of
you
nor
your
threats
this
forgery
of
course
is
the
work
of
that
french
spy
a
servant
tapped
at
the
door
and
handed
in
a
card
collins
took
it
glanced
at
it
and
looked
up
with
a
little
smile
of
satisfaction
it
tellier
he
said
i
was
expecting
him
he
was
certain
to
come
to
us
leave
him
to
me
and
he
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
monsieur
tellier
was
even
more
effulgent
than
usual
there
was
upon
his
face
a
smile
of
supreme
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
achieved
a
good
stroke
and
he
was
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
it
he
had
dreamed
dreams
and
seen
visions
one
vision
in
particular
which
included
within
the
same
circumference
himself
and
a
certain
frail
fairy
of
the
robinière
who
had
always
regarded
him
with
disdain
now
all
that
was
to
be
changed
so
he
greeted
collins
with
a
and
aplomb
quite
removed
from
his
ordinary
manner
collins
confronted
him
with
the
card
still
between
his
fingers
and
returned
his
greeting
with
the
utmost
coldness
you
wished
to
see
me
he
asked
pardon
corrected
tellier
it
is
lord
vernon
i
wish
to
see
lord
vernon
is
ill
and
sees
no
one
tellier
gave
his
mustachios
a
supercilious
twirl
you
still
maintain
that
farce
he
queried
i
assure
you
that
for
me
it
has
long
since
lost
its
novelty
collins
took
a
step
toward
the
door
shall
i
show
you
out
he
asked
no
not
yet
and
tellier
smiled
provokingly
you
would
really
better
let
me
show
you
out
said
collins
quietly
in
another
moment
i
shall
probably
kick
you
out
tellier
face
turned
a
deep
purple
and
his
white
teeth
gleamed
behind
his
moustache
have
a
care
he
said
hoarsely
that
expression
will
cost
you
dear
collins
smiled
contemptuously
oh
he
retorted
so
it
blackmail
i
might
have
known
from
your
appearance
well
my
dear
sir
you
have
mistaken
your
men
you
have
nothing
which
we
care
to
buy
you
would
better
go
a
purple
vein
stood
out
across
tellier
forehead
as
he
came
a
step
nearer
do
not
be
too
sure
monsieur
he
said
you
play
a
bold
game
but
it
does
not
for
an
instant
deceive
me
lord
vernon
is
no
more
ill
than
i
it
is
useless
to
deny
it
i
have
that
here
which
proves
it
written
with
his
own
hand
yes
pardie
written
in
my
presence
and
with
trembling
fingers
he
took
from
his
pocketbook
a
folded
slip
of
paper
indeed
said
collins
with
mild
curiosity
this
is
truly
wonderful
and
he
held
out
his
hand
but
tellier
drew
back
a
step
unfolded
the
note
and
held
it
open
between
his
fingers
you
may
read
it
he
said
his
eyes
flashing
with
triumph
but
come
no
nearer
collins
leisurely
got
out
his
monocle
polished
it
with
his
handkerchief
adjusted
it
and
scanned
the
note
really
he
said
unless
you
can
hold
it
a
little
steadier
i
fear
i
ca
read
it
tellier
steadied
his
hand
by
a
mighty
effort
and
watched
him
his
eyes
shining
but
the
face
of
the
englishman
did
not
change
not
in
a
single
line
not
by
the
merest
shadow
very
interesting
no
doubt
said
collins
dropping
his
glass
to
those
who
care
for
backstairs
intrigue
is
it
this
note
that
you
wish
to
sell
oh
not
that
corrected
tellier
with
a
little
offended
gesture
his
back
in
an
instant
you
mistake
me
i
am
not
of
that
sort
at
all
on
the
other
hand
it
is
friendship
for
you
which
has
brought
me
here
i
have
no
wish
to
injure
you
monsieur
and
you
yourself
of
course
perceive
fully
what
a
disaster
it
would
be
should
this
note
be
placed
in
certain
hands
to
what
adventure
does
the
note
refer
queried
collins
it
refers
to
the
adventure
of
lord
vernon
with
the
two
americans
on
the
afternoon
of
his
arrival
he
has
no
doubt
mentioned
it
to
you
lord
vernon
has
had
no
adventure
since
his
arrival
here
retorted
collins
coldly
but
go
ahead
with
your
story
as
i
was
saying
continued
tellier
i
am
a
poor
man
i
have
my
future
to
consider
i
can
not
afford
to
throw
away
this
opportunity
which
chance
has
placed
in
my
hands
i
will
be
reasonable
however
i
will
not
ask
too
much
a
hundred
thousand
francs
tellier
collins
interrupted
with
a
gesture
of
weariness
i
have
not
the
least
idea
what
you
mean
but
i
do
know
that
you
have
been
hoaxed
that
you
are
the
victim
of
some
deception
that
somebody
is
making
a
fool
of
you
a
hundred
thousand
francs
and
for
that
note
why
man
you
are
mad
or
very
very
drunk
we
do
want
the
note
we
have
no
concern
in
it
no
concern
in
it
shrieked
tellier
when
it
is
written
by
lord
vernon
lord
vernon
did
not
write
it
retorted
collins
coolly
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
it
then
your
eyes
deceived
you
evidently
you
are
not
acquainted
with
lord
vernon
writing
my
friend
shall
i
show
you
a
sample
wait
he
went
to
a
desk
got
out
a
unlocked
it
and
ran
rapidly
through
its
contents
while
tellier
watched
him
with
bloodshot
eyes
this
will
do
collins
said
at
last
a
note
to
monsieur
delcassé
with
which
you
are
perhaps
familiar
since
it
has
recently
been
made
public
look
at
it
tellier
almost
snatched
it
one
glance
was
enough
there
was
absolutely
no
resemblance
between
that
tall
angular
hand
and
the
writing
of
the
note
he
looked
at
the
signature
at
the
seal
there
could
be
no
doubting
them
his
lips
were
quivering
his
fat
cheeks
hanging
flaccid
as
he
handed
the
paper
back
you
are
playing
with
me
he
said
thickly
what
i
have
seen
i
have
seen
what
i
know
i
know
you
can
not
trick
me
i
will
go
to
the
prince
of
markeld
to
prince
ferdinand
himself
to
whomever
you
please
interrupted
collins
only
go
at
once
and
he
snatched
open
the
door
tellier
hesitated
an
instant
glanced
at
the
other
face
and
went
and
collins
closing
the
door
behind
him
mopped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
well
done
my
friend
he
said
exceedingly
well
done
and
with
that
he
turned
back
to
the
inner
room
dad
began
susie
rushford
that
evening
gently
but
firmly
taking
away
the
paper
over
which
her
father
was
engaged
i
wish
you
would
devote
that
massive
brain
of
yours
to
this
muddle
for
a
few
moments
and
give
me
the
benefit
it
quite
beyond
me
and
i
nearly
worried
to
death
over
it
i
want
your
advice
now
in
the
first
place
why
should
lord
vernon
play
off
sick
it
seems
such
a
little
thing
to
do
oaks
from
little
acorns
grow
quoted
her
father
this
little
thing
may
have
big
consequences
i
did
mean
little
that
way
explained
susie
i
meant
little
in
a
moral
way
well
my
dear
said
her
father
reflectively
everything
is
fair
in
love
war
and
diplomacy
your
diplomat
when
he
is
busy
at
his
trade
seems
to
lose
sight
of
fine
moral
distinctions
even
the
greatest
of
them
have
sometimes
stooped
to
acts
decidedly
small
and
yet
in
private
life
they
were
doubtless
honourable
men
it
a
good
deal
like
a
political
campaign
in
the
united
states
where
men
who
are
usually
honest
will
lie
about
the
other
side
without
any
twinges
of
conscience
there
even
a
in
the
libel
law
for
them
to
crawl
through
made
it
would
seem
especially
for
their
benefit
so
i
think
we
may
pass
up
the
moral
objection
but
what
does
he
hope
to
accomplish
dad
persisted
susie
what
he
accomplish
by
merely
sitting
still
a
great
many
things
may
be
accomplished
by
sitting
still
said
her
father
puffing
his
cigar
reflectively
it
is
one
of
those
simple
things
which
are
sometimes
very
difficult
to
do
i
found
that
out
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
my
checkered
career
now
that
we
are
through
with
precept
let
us
pass
on
to
example
you
dear
old
philosophical
thing
laughed
susie
what
should
you
say
lord
vernon
hoped
to
accomplish
in
this
instance
it
seems
very
plain
said
rushford
though
of
course
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
fancy
he
believes
that
while
he
is
playing
here
emperor
william
who
is
not
especially
renowned
for
patience
will
settle
the
question
of
the
succession
without
asking
any
advice
as
i
must
say
he
seems
to
have
a
perfect
right
to
do
in
that
case
it
would
of
course
be
too
late
for
england
to
interfere
she
could
only
express
her
regrets
to
prince
ferdinand
and
send
her
congratulations
to
prince
george
so
if
markeld
does
get
a
chance
to
say
his
little
speech
within
the
next
two
or
three
days
i
do
believe
he
ever
get
a
chance
susie
nodded
thoughtfully
the
prince
ought
to
be
able
to
reason
that
out
for
himself
he
i
should
think
so
if
he
can
see
farther
than
his
own
nose
were
you
thinking
of
going
to
his
assistance
take
my
advice
my
dear
and
refrain
you
and
nell
are
altogether
too
deep
in
it
as
it
is
again
susie
nodded
thank
you
dear
she
said
and
taking
him
by
either
ear
she
kissed
him
between
the
eyes
now
i
think
i
go
to
bed
i
a
mighty
knotty
problem
on
hand
and
i
got
to
work
it
out
right
away
can
i
help
any
more
no
and
she
shook
her
head
decidedly
this
is
one
of
those
odious
problems
which
a
person
has
to
work
out
alone
it
reminds
me
of
our
school
examinations
where
we
were
on
honour
not
to
ask
any
help
only
she
added
with
a
sigh
this
is
far
more
serious
said
her
father
and
watched
her
until
the
door
closed
behind
her
then
he
turned
again
to
his
paper
susie
alone
in
her
own
room
sat
with
her
head
in
her
hands
staring
out
across
the
moonlit
beach
away
in
the
distance
she
could
see
the
little
breakers
washing
white
upon
the
sand
to
the
left
stretched
the
long
brilliant
promenade
of
the
digue
ending
in
the
glare
of
light
which
marked
the
casino
the
peace
of
europe
she
murmured
the
peace
of
europe
i
wonder
if
he
was
merely
trying
to
frighten
me
and
she
shivered
a
little
at
the
remembrance
of
lord
vernon
words
as
she
arose
to
go
to
bed
chapter
xvi
a
prince
and
his
ideals
by
what
process
of
telepathy
the
dowager
duchess
of
markheim
dwelling
in
one
corner
of
that
gloomy
old
fortress
which
had
sheltered
so
many
generations
of
the
family
learned
of
the
danger
threatening
her
nephew
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
she
had
been
skilled
for
many
years
in
telling
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
nay
more
in
foreseeing
from
which
quarter
it
would
presently
blow
so
perhaps
the
two
or
three
casual
references
to
the
american
girls
which
she
had
gleaned
from
the
letters
which
the
prince
dutifully
wrote
her
had
been
enough
to
awaken
her
suspicions
or
it
may
be
that
some
one
of
the
many
persons
at
who
had
observed
with
interest
the
prince
comings
and
goings
deemed
it
a
duty
to
society
to
send
the
duchess
a
discreet
word
of
warning
any
one
who
knew
the
duchess
knew
also
that
a
single
word
would
be
her
reputation
for
worldly
astuteness
surpassed
that
of
any
other
old
woman
in
europe
though
it
was
perhaps
not
altogether
deserved
forty
years
before
she
had
been
a
healthy
and
happy
girl
whose
experience
of
the
world
had
been
confined
to
the
family
estate
near
gemünden
and
the
estate
was
a
small
one
for
the
family
though
of
blood
the
bluest
was
very
poor
one
tragedy
had
marked
her
early
girlhood
she
was
curled
up
one
evening
in
the
at
the
stairhead
watching
the
moon
rise
over
the
great
trees
of
the
park
when
she
heard
loud
voices
in
the
hall
below
and
peeping
down
saw
her
father
strike
another
man
heavily
across
the
mouth
a
sudden
silence
fell
and
she
stole
away
frightened
to
her
bed
where
she
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
her
mother
had
awakened
her
had
carried
her
to
a
window
and
knelt
with
her
there
staring
out
toward
the
park
and
calling
upon
god
to
have
mercy
through
the
streaming
mist
there
came
presently
toward
them
two
dim
figures
carrying
a
third
what
need
to
go
on
after
that
the
house
became
a
cloister
it
chanced
one
day
when
she
was
nearly
twenty
that
the
eye
of
her
cousin
of
markheim
fell
upon
her
he
had
never
married
he
had
been
too
busy
with
his
pleasures
but
he
had
arrived
at
an
age
when
it
was
necessary
to
think
of
an
heir
at
an
age
too
when
the
uneasy
consciousness
began
to
grow
within
him
that
if
he
desired
an
heir
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
so
he
looked
at
his
blooming
cousin
noting
the
evidences
of
vigorous
health
which
glowed
in
eye
and
lip
and
cheek
he
knew
that
the
girl
would
have
no
dot
but
he
had
reached
a
place
where
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
if
he
wanted
youth
and
beauty
he
must
take
them
unadorned
so
he
made
up
his
mind
at
once
and
in
due
time
the
marriage
was
arranged
in
pity
we
will
not
dwell
upon
it
those
who
saw
the
bride
face
as
she
entered
the
carriage
with
her
husband
will
never
forget
its
expression
of
horror
disgust
and
abject
fear
a
year
later
the
desired
heir
arrived
a
microcephalous
idiot
to
whom
a
merciful
providence
allowed
but
eighteen
months
of
life
and
in
due
time
the
august
prince
himself
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
during
her
period
of
martyrdom
the
duchess
had
pressed
her
cross
to
her
bosom
with
the
religious
enthusiasm
of
a
devotee
hugging
his
barbed
instrument
of
torture
the
consciousness
that
she
was
suffering
for
her
family
sake
as
became
a
daughter
of
the
caesars
was
the
only
thing
which
enabled
her
to
endure
her
shame
and
degradation
she
donned
her
widow
weeds
with
such
depth
of
thankfulness
as
few
mortals
know
and
settled
herself
to
the
enjoyment
of
her
position
she
found
it
on
the
whole
a
good
position
unassailable
with
many
desirable
perquisites
she
decided
no
doubt
that
life
owed
her
such
tremendous
arrears
of
happiness
that
she
could
never
hope
to
collect
them
except
by
devoting
her
whole
time
to
it
and
devote
her
whole
time
to
it
she
did
in
good
earnest
the
years
in
their
passage
erased
certain
lines
from
her
face
and
restored
the
curves
to
her
figure
indeed
it
came
to
be
much
more
than
a
restoration
but
they
could
not
restore
the
colour
to
her
hair
nor
the
lightness
to
her
heart
she
looked
at
mankind
from
a
cynical
altitude
of
worldly
wisdom
her
wit
grew
keen
and
swift
as
rapier
her
had
a
way
of
passing
into
proverbs
or
of
being
stolen
by
more
distinguished
contemporaries
she
took
her
revenge
upon
society
as
completely
as
she
could
yet
without
bitterness
indeed
it
is
probable
that
could
she
have
ordered
her
life
anew
she
would
not
have
ordered
it
differently
such
then
was
the
dowager
duchess
of
markheim
as
she
sat
gazing
thoughtfully
from
her
window
pondering
the
situation
she
was
fully
alive
to
the
fact
that
american
girls
are
always
a
menace
to
the
peace
of
noble
families
besides
she
was
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
progress
or
rather
lack
of
progress
which
the
prince
had
made
in
the
delicate
negotiation
entrusted
to
his
hands
in
a
word
she
decided
that
from
every
point
of
view
it
were
wise
for
her
to
be
herself
upon
the
scene
and
so
much
nearer
her
beloved
ostend
therefore
being
of
that
superior
order
of
woman
who
never
has
to
make
up
her
mind
but
once
she
forthwith
gave
orders
for
the
departure
it
consequently
happened
on
the
morning
following
the
events
narrated
in
the
previous
chapter
that
there
was
another
distinguished
arrival
at
the
grand
hôtel
royal
to
the
delight
and
despair
of
monsieur
pelletan
i
shall
need
an
apartment
of
at
least
five
rooms
not
higher
than
the
second
floor
announced
the
duchess
if
madame
la
duchesse
had
only
notified
us
of
honour
protested
pelletan
with
upraised
hands
i
swear
i
haff
not
one
single
apartment
off
madame
not
efen
one
leetle
room
up
under
gutters
nonsense
she
interrupted
vigorously
i
have
heard
all
that
a
hundred
times
at
least
which
apartment
has
my
nephew
madame
nephew
certainly
imbecile
monsieur
le
prince
de
markeld
oh
cried
pelletan
monsieur
le
prince
hass
apartment
b
de
luxe
and
so
has
twice
as
much
room
as
he
needs
of
course
well
take
my
luggage
up
there
wherever
it
is
at
my
age
one
is
beyond
the
reach
of
scandal
even
at
a
dutch
where
is
monsieur
le
prince
monsieur
le
prince
iss
taking
promenade
explained
pelletan
very
well
i
have
my
toilette
to
make
when
he
returns
send
him
up
to
me
at
once
here
boy
apartment
b
and
followed
by
her
maid
she
started
up
the
stair
leaving
monsieur
pelletan
staring
but
iss
a
lift
madame
he
cried
regaining
his
breath
a
lift
retorted
the
duchess
at
my
age
what
is
the
man
thinking
of
en
avant
boy
and
she
went
on
up
the
stair
the
watches
of
the
night
had
not
brought
that
final
solution
of
the
problem
which
susie
rushford
had
hoped
for
and
she
did
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
when
she
found
the
prince
at
the
stairfoot
awaiting
her
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
wholly
undividedly
glad
one
glance
at
his
face
told
her
that
and
he
greeted
her
in
a
way
that
sent
a
little
thrill
to
her
heart
after
all
she
told
herself
perhaps
she
would
better
let
things
drift
one
more
day
could
make
no
difference
and
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
take
the
affair
more
seriously
than
did
the
principal
person
concerned
in
it
outside
the
door
as
usual
was
the
invalid
chair
and
while
lord
vernon
did
not
forget
to
say
it
was
not
upon
her
his
eyes
rested
nell
at
least
was
perplexed
by
no
problems
and
was
unaffectedly
gay
susie
almost
envied
her
and
yet
problems
were
interesting
too
and
then
there
was
collins
as
she
acknowledged
his
bow
she
was
struck
anew
with
the
concentrated
secretiveness
of
his
appearance
there
was
a
new
look
in
his
eyes
this
morning
a
look
as
though
he
were
watching
her
and
it
made
her
vaguely
uneasy
but
the
feeling
passed
as
they
turned
eastward
along
the
promenade
and
she
soon
forgot
all
about
him
for
quite
exceptionally
her
companion
was
talking
of
himself
i
do
not
want
that
you
should
exaggerate
the
importance
of
this
little
dispute
he
was
saying
seen
thus
close
at
hand
it
looms
rather
large
but
it
really
matters
very
little
to
the
great
world
even
i
can
get
far
enough
away
from
it
to
see
that
and
yet
rejoined
susie
i
have
heard
it
said
that
it
might
possibly
endanger
the
peace
of
europe
the
prince
smiled
at
the
words
as
at
an
old
acquaintance
the
peace
of
europe
he
said
is
a
kind
of
bugaboo
which
diplomats
use
to
frighten
each
other
with
and
even
to
frighten
themselves
with
i
do
not
believe
that
the
peace
of
europe
hangs
on
any
such
delicate
balance
as
they
pretend
though
of
course
he
added
more
gravely
there
are
certain
circumstances
under
which
this
question
of
the
succession
might
become
very
unpleasant
to
the
powers
ah
breathed
susie
who
had
been
listening
eagerly
you
admit
that
then
admit
it
certainly
why
not
but
intrinsically
it
amounts
to
little
so
it
is
with
us
markelds
our
lineage
is
as
long
as
that
of
any
house
in
europe
and
we
hold
our
heads
very
high
but
we
are
really
of
not
much
importance
we
keep
up
a
certain
state
we
live
in
a
castle
if
you
will
but
we
really
do
nothing
worth
while
principally
i
suppose
because
we
are
so
poor
so
poor
echoed
susie
you
are
thinking
of
the
apartment
de
luxe
said
the
prince
with
a
smile
of
the
special
train
but
do
you
not
see
those
are
the
very
things
which
make
me
poor
i
have
no
use
for
seven
rooms
in
the
special
train
i
can
occupy
but
a
single
seat
all
the
rest
is
waste
which
does
me
no
good
rather
the
reverse
indeed
since
it
serves
to
impress
people
with
an
exaggerated
idea
of
my
importance
and
so
pave
the
way
for
fresh
extravagances
i
did
not
mean
that
i
am
poor
absolutely
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
shall
ever
want
for
food
and
clothing
and
a
place
to
sleep
it
is
only
as
a
prince
that
i
am
poor
that
we
markelds
are
all
poor
but
one
would
think
there
were
many
things
worth
while
which
a
man
in
your
position
could
do
said
susie
earnestly
even
if
you
rich
oh
he
explained
looking
down
at
her
with
a
laugh
in
his
eyes
i
would
not
have
you
think
that
i
am
always
wholly
idle
i
am
colonel
of
a
dragoon
regiment
and
i
inspect
it
sometimes
or
ride
in
front
of
it
at
a
general
review
i
hunt
i
attend
various
functions
of
the
court
i
even
sometimes
act
as
the
representative
of
my
house
as
i
am
doing
now
none
of
which
said
susie
except
perhaps
the
last
is
in
the
least
worth
while
i
agree
with
you
unreservedly
he
assented
but
it
is
about
what
most
men
in
my
position
do
so
i
have
heard
said
sue
but
i
never
really
believed
it
i
thought
it
an
invention
of
the
society
reporters
it
is
true
nevertheless
you
see
there
is
no
incentive
for
most
of
us
to
do
anything
else
of
course
we
can
not
work
nor
engage
in
trade
i
do
admit
the
course
but
leaving
that
aside
for
the
moment
are
there
any
exceptions
yes
a
few
at
whom
the
rest
of
us
look
rather
askance
you
see
there
is
the
tradition
to
be
maintained
the
tradition
of
royalty
of
divine
right
we
must
do
nothing
to
spoil
the
tradition
or
weaken
it
or
our
people
may
find
out
that
we
are
not
really
necessary
after
all
just
as
the
americans
have
done
susie
glanced
at
him
to
see
if
he
was
in
earnest
but
he
appeared
to
be
entirely
so
do
the
exceptions
mind
being
looked
askance
at
she
questioned
no
i
do
not
think
they
mind
in
the
least
most
of
them
are
too
busy
to
pay
any
heed
to
what
other
people
are
thinking
about
them
besides
the
cause
of
the
exception
is
usually
a
woman
who
takes
up
most
of
the
exception
leisure
time
i
afraid
i
do
quite
understand
let
me
explain
you
see
when
one
of
us
marries
a
woman
of
his
own
class
comtessen
serene
english
altessen
as
svengali
called
them
he
usually
gets
a
partner
more
ah
hidebound
i
think
you
call
it
than
himself
a
greater
stickler
for
precedent
and
tradition
and
position
and
etiquette
and
elegant
leisure
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
whatever
liberal
ideas
he
may
have
had
he
finds
he
must
abandon
or
at
least
suppress
if
there
is
to
be
peace
between
his
wife
and
him
it
is
only
those
who
are
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
and
win
exactly
the
right
woman
of
their
class
who
get
the
incentive
you
understand
now
yes
said
susie
with
a
queer
catch
in
her
voice
yes
i
think
i
do
so
he
added
with
a
little
bitter
laugh
you
see
why
we
others
look
askance
at
these
exceptions
in
the
first
place
they
have
preferred
to
step
down
out
of
their
rank
for
a
wife
that
deals
a
blow
at
the
tradition
and
every
blow
weakens
it
in
the
second
place
they
have
left
some
noble
lady
husbandless
for
your
noble
ladies
seldom
so
far
forget
their
rank
as
to
marry
out
of
it
though
that
may
be
because
the
men
never
permit
them
to
again
an
injury
to
us
as
a
class
and
finally
they
are
mixing
with
the
world
they
are
meeting
other
men
face
to
face
as
equals
they
are
claiming
no
merit
because
of
birth
no
authority
because
of
rank
they
are
perhaps
even
working
with
their
hands
whereas
our
business
is
to
keep
aloof
from
the
world
to
maintain
a
barrier
of
caste
between
ourselves
and
other
men
for
they
must
not
suspect
that
we
are
as
imperfect
as
they
that
we
have
the
same
appetites
and
passions
the
same
defects
and
meannesses
our
business
is
to
rule
over
them
to
require
their
obedience
because
god
so
wills
it
we
tremble
when
we
see
the
apostates
cast
aside
their
rank
and
descend
into
the
world
arena
for
we
fear
that
the
people
finding
them
at
close
view
only
human
may
come
at
last
to
believe
that
the
right
by
which
we
rule
is
not
after
all
divine
then
they
will
tear
down
the
barrier
of
caste
strip
us
of
the
privileges
of
rank
and
proclaim
the
absurdity
that
all
men
are
equal
and
i
might
add
we
are
jealous
of
the
exceptions
because
they
are
happy
marriages
of
state
are
seldom
love
matches
the
kind
which
furnish
the
incentives
are
always
so
to
all
of
which
susie
had
listened
with
bated
breath
only
glancing
up
once
or
twice
to
study
her
companion
face
it
was
a
lifting
of
the
curtain
a
revelation
of
the
heart
which
left
her
deeply
moved
you
do
seem
to
care
for
the
tradition
she
said
at
last
oh
yes
i
do
it
would
be
untrue
to
pretend
otherwise
only
it
has
occurred
to
me
quite
recently
that
merely
to
inherit
a
position
is
not
quite
enough
a
man
should
try
to
deserve
it
and
you
going
to
try
asked
susie
looking
at
him
with
something
very
like
adoration
in
her
eyes
i
am
going
to
try
yes
he
answered
but
i
shall
need
help
i
am
afraid
i
should
not
make
a
success
of
it
by
myself
and
then
he
fell
silent
for
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
promenade
where
the
others
joined
them
chapter
xvii
the
duchess
to
the
rescue
it
may
be
that
lord
vernon
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
find
a
topic
of
conversation
equally
absorbing
at
any
rate
nell
entered
the
hotel
with
her
sister
rather
subdued
and
tremulous
and
they
mounted
to
their
rooms
in
silence
a
week
before
they
would
probably
have
thrown
themselves
into
each
other
arms
and
kissed
each
other
and
cuddled
each
other
and
cried
over
each
other
without
precisely
knowing
why
or
at
least
without
troubling
to
put
the
reason
into
words
but
the
events
of
the
past
few
days
had
imperceptibly
wrought
a
change
in
their
relations
an
impalpable
veil
had
come
between
them
a
subtle
dissonance
in
point
of
view
they
were
pledged
as
it
were
to
rival
interests
a
woman
who
has
no
other
confidante
will
invariably
seek
counsel
and
sympathy
of
her
own
reflected
self
and
if
so
it
was
in
this
case
for
each
of
our
two
heroines
went
straight
to
her
room
and
locked
the
door
and
sat
down
before
her
glass
and
chin
in
hands
communed
long
and
earnestly
with
the
image
pictured
there
gazing
deep
into
its
eyes
and
thinking
unutterable
thoughts
which
completely
defy
transcription
at
the
same
moment
to
archibald
rushford
sitting
immersed
in
his
morning
newspaper
wholly
unsuspicious
of
all
this
the
prince
of
markeld
card
was
handed
it
may
be
noted
in
passing
that
with
the
influx
of
patrons
to
the
house
the
american
had
found
it
necessary
to
retire
to
the
privacy
of
his
own
apartment
in
order
to
enjoy
the
paper
undisturbed
all
rights
show
him
up
he
said
when
he
had
glanced
at
the
card
and
almost
immediately
the
prince
himself
appeared
rushford
started
up
with
hand
outstretched
glad
to
see
you
prince
he
said
i
was
just
figuring
on
looking
you
up
and
wondering
how
i
better
go
about
it
i
did
quite
know
what
the
etiquette
of
the
thing
was
the
prince
laughed
the
etiquette
is
simple
he
answered
you
have
only
to
come
to
my
door
and
knock
refreshingly
democratic
and
rushford
eyes
danced
that
would
appeal
to
my
countrymen
but
my
ignorance
was
natural
enough
you
see
we
never
have
the
chance
at
home
to
hobnob
with
highnesses
that
the
reason
so
many
of
us
come
abroad
but
we
not
the
real
thing
the
genuine
american
stays
at
home
and
looks
after
his
business
and
no
doubt
gets
along
very
well
without
highnesses
laughed
markeld
gripping
the
proffered
fingers
with
a
warmth
which
pleased
their
owner
the
latter
found
himself
admiring
too
the
erect
figure
the
clean
face
the
clear
eyes
he
told
himself
with
pleasure
that
the
prince
looked
as
well
by
daylight
as
by
gaslight
a
tribute
to
his
youth
and
the
way
he
had
employed
it
sit
down
wo
you
he
asked
cordially
yes
the
people
of
the
states
manage
to
worry
along
some
way
without
any
nobility
in
fact
they
rather
got
a
prejudice
against
that
sort
of
thing
you
see
the
only
highnesses
they
had
to
judge
by
are
the
who
come
over
after
our
girls
now
i
always
believed
that
it
is
any
fairer
to
judge
european
nobility
by
those
specimens
than
it
is
to
judge
us
americans
by
the
expatriated
idiots
one
finds
here
in
europe
it
like
judging
a
bin
of
apples
by
the
rotten
ones
you
are
doubtless
right
agreed
the
prince
who
had
followed
these
remarks
with
an
anxiety
almost
painful
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
speak
in
that
way
i
infer
that
you
do
not
object
to
international
marriages
not
at
all
per
se
other
things
being
equal
i
see
no
reason
why
a
highness
should
make
as
good
a
husband
as
a
plain
american
only
one
reason
for
marriage
sir
mutual
affection
where
that
exists
nothing
else
matters
where
it
does
exist
well
marriage
becomes
simply
a
convenient
arrangement
for
perpetuating
a
family
or
restoring
its
estates
or
accomplishing
some
less
laudable
purpose
but
there
shut
me
off
do
let
me
preach
at
you
no
no
protested
the
prince
all
that
you
say
interests
me
deeply
more
deeply
than
you
suspect
in
fact
i
hope
to
marry
an
american
girl
myself
ah
said
rushford
swallowing
with
sudden
difficulty
oh
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
wish
to
propose
to
you
for
the
hand
of
your
daughter
explained
the
prince
quite
simply
rushford
was
not
a
man
easily
astonished
but
there
was
no
denying
his
amazement
at
this
moment
despite
his
playful
words
to
susie
he
had
never
really
suspected
the
direction
in
which
events
were
trending
besides
the
even
though
expected
is
always
a
shock
but
the
prince
bore
his
gaze
imperturbably
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
are
surprised
he
said
you
have
known
me
so
short
a
time
but
we
markelds
always
know
our
own
minds
i
have
thought
the
matter
over
very
carefully
and
i
am
sure
that
i
am
acting
wisely
whether
you
would
act
wisely
in
giving
her
to
me
is
another
question
for
though
i
am
a
prince
i
am
a
very
small
one
though
with
income
sufficient
i
trust
to
maintain
a
wife
at
least
comfortably
i
shall
be
glad
to
send
my
solicitors
to
talk
it
over
with
you
and
explain
anything
about
me
which
you
may
care
to
know
rushford
face
had
gradually
relaxed
during
this
harangue
until
it
was
positively
smiling
my
dear
sir
he
interrupted
if
there
anything
about
you
i
want
to
know
i
ask
but
that
is
hardly
necessary
as
yet
for
taking
hold
of
the
matter
by
the
wrong
end
we
of
america
do
give
our
daughters
away
they
choose
their
own
husbands
subject
of
course
to
their
parents
approval
now
my
daughter
by
the
way
you
specified
which
one
you
after
it
is
miss
sue
that
i
want
said
the
prince
ah
susie
well
she
perfectly
capable
of
choosing
for
herself
and
will
probably
insist
upon
doing
so
have
you
spoken
to
her
on
the
subject
oh
most
certainly
not
stammered
the
prince
well
suppose
you
take
it
up
with
her
suggested
rushford
encouragingly
if
she
wants
you
it
be
all
right
with
me
i
may
even
say
that
i
be
very
glad
to
see
you
get
her
i
like
you
better
than
i
ever
imagined
i
should
like
a
nobleman
the
prince
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
with
outstretched
hands
thank
you
my
dear
sir
he
cried
a
thousand
thanks
i
have
then
your
permission
to
speak
to
miss
rushford
my
permission
yes
and
my
best
wishes
and
prince
he
added
as
the
latter
turned
away
do
worry
about
the
matter
of
income
susie
will
be
able
to
help
you
out
a
little
whether
the
prince
heard
or
not
i
do
not
know
for
as
he
hurried
from
the
room
he
collided
with
monsieur
pelletan
who
clutched
his
coat
as
he
would
have
hastened
past
oh
monsieur
le
prince
gasped
the
little
man
i
haf
eferywhere
been
searching
for
you
madame
la
duchesse
de
markheim
arrived
some
hours
ago
and
awaits
you
wit
greates
impatience
where
is
she
she
iss
in
monsieur
apartment
she
insiste
i
very
well
i
will
go
to
her
said
the
prince
and
bounded
down
the
stair
a
moment
later
he
was
kissing
his
aunt
extended
hand
white
and
soft
as
in
the
days
of
her
maidenhood
though
with
an
added
plumpness
my
dear
aunt
he
cried
i
but
this
moment
heard
that
you
were
here
you
see
i
have
made
myself
comfortable
my
dear
fritz
smiled
the
old
lady
her
impatience
forgotten
the
moment
her
eyes
rested
upon
his
handsome
face
and
i
have
not
been
lonesome
monsieur
tellier
has
been
relating
to
me
a
number
of
very
interesting
things
tellier
the
prince
started
round
as
the
detective
arose
smirked
and
bowed
in
his
humblest
manner
i
ca
say
that
i
congratulate
you
on
your
choice
of
a
companion
madame
do
put
on
your
grand
manner
with
me
fritz
she
protested
still
laughing
i
am
very
glad
that
monsieur
tellier
sought
me
out
but
what
is
the
matter
with
that
creature
of
yours
hovering
in
the
background
the
prince
turned
and
beheld
glück
evidently
expecting
orders
to
accomplish
an
assault
upon
the
detective
person
oh
he
explained
i
told
glück
he
might
throw
tellier
out
the
next
time
he
tried
to
get
in
here
i
afraid
you
have
to
wait
a
few
minutes
my
friend
he
added
and
glück
retired
visibly
disappointed
let
me
tell
you
said
the
duchess
emphatically
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
that
your
prejudice
against
monsieur
tellier
is
wholly
unwarranted
and
very
foolish
he
has
discovered
many
things
which
you
seem
to
have
overlooked
perhaps
admitted
the
prince
but
he
has
discovered
them
in
a
way
that
no
gentleman
could
countenance
which
reminds
me
he
added
suddenly
turning
a
fiery
countenance
upon
the
unhappy
frenchman
that
i
have
an
account
of
my
own
to
settle
with
him
how
dared
you
annoy
but
the
duchess
held
up
her
hand
one
moment
fritz
she
interrupted
sternly
do
begin
throwing
stones
until
you
are
quite
sure
you
are
not
yourself
in
a
glass
house
as
i
have
said
monsieur
tellier
had
many
things
of
interest
to
relate
well
my
dear
aunt
retorted
the
prince
now
that
he
has
related
them
i
trust
we
may
dispense
with
his
company
i
will
settle
my
account
with
him
another
time
first
said
the
duchess
with
cold
irony
tell
me
what
progress
you
have
made
with
your
embassy
fritz
very
little
i
am
sorry
to
say
madame
but
in
three
days
lord
vernon
has
promised
to
consider
the
matter
three
days
and
do
you
imagine
all
the
rest
of
the
world
will
stand
still
at
your
command
fritz
and
wait
for
you
are
you
another
joshua
the
prince
flushed
there
was
no
denying
the
justice
of
the
taunt
but
that
aside
for
the
moment
continued
the
duchess
tell
me
something
of
this
american
girl
you
have
met
here
and
with
whom
you
have
grown
so
fond
of
making
the
promenade
i
hope
soon
to
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
her
to
you
madame
said
the
prince
flushing
still
more
i
believe
you
will
find
her
admirable
perhaps
said
the
duchess
sceptically
is
it
really
necessary
that
i
should
meet
her
that
of
course
will
be
as
madame
pleases
i
thought
you
would
naturally
wish
to
meet
the
woman
whom
it
is
my
intention
to
marry
the
duchess
fairly
jumped
in
her
chair
to
marry
she
cried
to
marry
what
nonsense
you
will
see
continued
the
prince
calmly
how
unwise
it
was
to
begin
the
conversation
in
the
presence
of
this
gentleman
no
cried
the
duchess
it
was
more
than
ever
wise
do
you
happen
to
know
who
this
woman
is
i
refuse
to
discuss
my
affairs
further
said
the
prince
until
we
are
alone
but
do
you
know
who
she
is
she
has
no
dot
perhaps
you
will
say
that
is
nothing
that
you
expected
none
though
it
seems
to
me
it
is
your
duty
to
repair
the
fortunes
of
our
house
but
it
is
even
worse
than
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
an
i
refuse
to
believe
it
answered
the
prince
quietly
monsieur
tellier
relate
to
him
if
tellier
so
much
as
moves
a
finger
i
will
kick
him
down
the
stairs
added
the
prince
still
more
calmly
but
he
has
the
papers
from
the
notary
that
is
nothing
to
me
the
duchess
made
a
gesture
of
despair
yet
after
all
she
cried
that
is
a
little
thing
beside
this
other
look
at
this
and
she
snatched
a
folded
paper
from
the
table
at
her
elbow
she
is
a
traitor
to
you
she
has
been
playing
with
you
she
has
been
assisting
these
englishmen
to
deceive
you
you
who
are
such
a
stickler
for
honour
in
women
no
less
than
men
look
at
this
what
is
this
paper
asked
the
prince
making
no
motion
to
take
it
from
her
eager
hand
it
is
a
note
which
this
impostor
wrote
to
her
and
to
her
sister
and
obtained
how
he
questioned
a
little
pale
but
keeping
himself
well
in
hand
obtained
by
monsieur
tellier
replied
the
duchess
it
does
not
matter
how
no
said
the
prince
perhaps
not
yet
one
can
easily
guess
by
bribing
the
chambermaid
perhaps
by
forcing
a
lock
by
rifling
her
desk
examining
her
private
papers
oh
it
is
abominable
and
he
turned
upon
the
frenchman
fury
in
his
eyes
no
no
monsieur
le
prince
protested
tellier
it
was
none
of
these
i
swear
it
she
left
the
note
lying
quite
carelessly
but
the
prince
was
upon
him
with
one
hand
at
the
back
of
his
neck
he
steered
him
sputtering
to
the
door
glück
he
cried
and
pitched
the
frenchman
into
the
arms
of
the
faithful
servant
the
duchess
sitting
within
the
room
caught
the
sound
of
a
scuffle
of
fierce
swearing
then
a
succession
of
dull
bumps
sounded
through
the
apartment
the
prince
closed
the
door
and
turned
back
to
her
but
my
dear
fritz
she
protested
it
may
be
true
that
tellier
is
abominable
yet
sometimes
one
must
use
such
instruments
surely
at
this
moment
we
are
justified
in
using
any
instrument
i
have
paid
him
thank
heaven
you
must
listen
to
reason
you
have
been
fooled
we
have
all
been
fooled
they
have
been
playing
with
us
laughing
at
us
behind
our
backs
for
our
simplicity
the
girl
as
well
as
the
others
no
he
said
fiercely
no
fritz
she
cried
her
voice
trembling
a
mist
before
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
you
believe
that
i
love
you
do
you
not
oh
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
you
believe
that
i
desire
your
happiness
but
it
must
be
happiness
with
honour
fritz
as
becomes
a
markeld
you
have
your
name
to
consider
your
house
you
know
that
i
would
rather
oh
a
hundred
times
wound
myself
than
wound
you
you
must
listen
then
when
i
tell
you
that
this
girl
is
not
worthy
of
you
when
i
tell
you
that
this
note
proves
it
read
it
he
commanded
in
a
hoarse
voice
read
it
then
vernon
will
be
deeply
grateful
she
read
he
is
not
mentioned
in
connection
with
adventure
adventure
when
he
kicked
jax
away
from
her
can
you
doubt
can
you
be
so
stupid
as
to
doubt
these
americans
they
have
no
sense
of
honour
he
turned
to
the
window
without
answering
but
his
face
was
drawn
and
white

perfidy
to
archibald
rushford
sitting
ruminant
in
his
room
staring
absently
out
at
the
dunes
and
the
sea
his
paper
forgotten
there
entered
presently
susie
a
rather
subdued
susie
as
he
noted
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
who
drew
up
a
chair
very
close
to
his
and
sat
down
and
propped
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
looked
up
at
him
it
came
to
him
in
a
flash
of
revelation
that
did
she
have
a
mother
it
was
to
her
she
would
have
gone
at
this
moment
and
not
to
him
and
his
eyes
were
a
little
misty
as
he
looked
down
at
her
that
she
and
her
sister
should
have
grown
motherless
to
such
sweet
triumphant
womanhood
struck
him
in
this
instant
as
a
kind
of
miracle
he
had
never
thought
of
it
before
he
had
taken
their
beauty
their
wit
their
sanity
as
matters
of
course
he
had
never
looked
at
them
clearly
from
the
outside
he
had
never
quite
thoroughly
appreciated
them
they
had
come
this
far
guideless
in
the
journey
of
life
and
had
done
well
and
bravely
but
now
susie
at
least
had
reached
a
point
in
the
path
where
she
needed
help
and
counsel
she
had
come
to
him
for
it
and
he
must
give
her
the
best
he
had
dad
she
began
a
little
tremulously
would
you
mind
so
much
if
i
should
and
live
in
europe
of
course
she
added
hastily
to
break
the
force
of
the
blow
you
would
come
over
very
often
and
stay
with
us
and
we
would
go
over
very
often
to
see
you
so
he
spoken
to
you
has
he
laughed
her
father
he
told
me
he
had
spoken
you
know
about
it
oh
dad
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
a
certain
william
frederick
albert
of
markeld
i
believe
that
his
name
or
most
of
it
was
in
here
a
while
ago
and
had
the
impudence
to
ask
me
to
give
you
to
him
oh
gasped
susie
with
flaming
cheeks
and
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
i
dare
say
cried
a
little
but
her
father
did
see
her
for
his
own
eyes
were
full
of
tears
the
moment
passed
the
tears
were
wiped
away
tell
me
about
it
dad
she
said
tell
you
about
it
i
have
told
you
about
what
he
said
how
did
he
look
i
dare
say
he
looked
about
as
he
always
does
a
little
pale
around
the
gills
perhaps
as
one
usually
does
when
one
performing
an
unpleasant
duty
dad
you
do
mean
to
say
you
think
he
enjoyed
it
they
they
always
have
to
do
it
in
europe
faltered
sue
so
i
understand
but
he
said
he
had
told
you
he
has
he
has
said
a
word
oh
just
sort
of
scented
it
in
the
air
i
suppose
sort
of
saw
it
coming
every
woman
can
tell
when
a
man
is
in
with
her
explained
susie
with
dignity
but
boggling
a
little
at
the
crucial
word
what
did
you
tell
him
dad
i
told
him
to
take
you
and
welcome
now
dad
you
must
tease
well
then
i
told
him
he
better
see
you
first
since
you
the
party
principally
concerned
but
you
like
him
immensely
susie
arms
were
about
his
neck
and
her
cheek
was
against
his
cheek
and
a
pearly
tear
plashed
down
upon
his
oh
you
dear
dad
she
cried
i
knew
you
like
him
he
seems
a
pretty
straight
sort
of
fellow
observed
her
father
he
looks
clean
and
he
talks
like
a
man
and
you
wo
mind
so
very
much
not
if
it
makes
you
happy
my
dear
all
girls
have
to
marry
sometime
i
suppose
you
be
rather
farther
away
from
me
than
i
could
wish
but
i
dare
say
the
prince
will
let
me
come
over
and
stay
in
his
castle
occasionally
and
eat
at
the
second
table
you
why
he
you
to
why
could
you
come
over
and
live
with
us
dad
and
die
of
ennui
in
a
year
not
much
i
go
home
and
make
some
more
money
for
you
you
see
i
never
figured
on
having
to
finance
a
princess
dad
very
softly
well
what
do
you
know
i
do
believe
he
suspects
i
to
have
any
money
neither
do
i
that
one
thing
i
like
about
him
but
you
really
might
come
and
live
with
us
dad
oh
no
i
might
besides
there
nell
what
he
cried
interpreting
the
sudden
pressure
of
her
arms
you
do
mean
that
gone
and
done
it
too
i
do
know
dad
but
lord
vernon
has
been
very
attentive
to
her
she
has
told
me
anything
i
only
guessing
her
father
gave
a
long
low
whistle
well
he
said
you
been
hustling
things
up
with
a
vengeance
i
must
say
there
must
be
something
in
the
atmosphere
it
be
a
little
lonely
in
that
big
new
york
house
without
you
susie
i
know
it
will
dear
dad
and
if
you
say
the
word
i
wo
leave
you
not
for
a
long
long
time
it
will
be
a
long
time
anyway
you
know
a
year
at
least
there
will
be
so
much
to
do
and
a
year
is
quite
long
enough
to
keep
two
lovers
apart
youth
goes
faster
than
you
think
my
dear
no
no
it
be
all
right
susie
you
do
suppose
i
as
selfish
as
all
that
no
dad
that
just
what
i
afraid
of
you
not
selfish
enough
it
i
who
am
selfish
nonsense
everybody
in
this
world
has
a
right
to
happiness
susie
why
that
one
of
the
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
i
take
it
a
woman
great
chance
of
happiness
is
in
marrying
the
man
she
loves
that
what
every
woman
has
a
right
to
do
and
nobody
has
the
right
to
raise
a
finger
to
prevent
her
i
give
you
to
markeld
with
a
clear
conscience
my
dear
when
the
time
comes
and
bless
you
both
that
is
if
you
really
love
him
oh
dad
she
cried
and
hid
her
face
there
is
one
light
in
the
eyes
which
none
but
a
lover
may
see
quite
sure
he
persisted
quite
sure
she
said
softly
you
sure
you
not
jumping
in
the
dark
it
is
the
prince
in
love
with
no
dad
it
the
man
that
seems
an
awfully
bold
thing
for
a
girl
to
say
does
it
but
he
he
such
a
nice
fellow
yes
i
believe
he
is
agreed
her
father
he
been
telling
me
about
himself
you
know
about
what
he
wants
to
do
in
the
world
added
susie
looking
up
at
him
has
he
and
her
father
laughed
the
same
old
game
effective
as
ever
we
all
do
it
why
i
remember
susie
he
stopped
suddenly
with
a
little
tremor
in
his
voice
yes
dad
very
softly
she
was
leaning
forward
on
his
knee
looking
up
at
him
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
close
you
like
your
mother
susie
was
all
he
dared
trust
himself
to
say
his
arms
tight
around
her
they
sat
so
a
moment
lost
in
memory
until
a
knock
at
the
door
brought
susie
to
her
feet
a
page
handed
in
a
little
package
for
mademoiselle
rushford
he
said
thank
you
said
susie
and
closed
the
door
for
me
she
repeated
as
she
turned
back
into
the
room
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
the
quickest
way
to
find
out
is
to
open
it
my
dear
suggested
her
father
drily
susie
ripped
the
paper
off
in
an
instant
and
disclosed
a
little
book
bound
in
flexible
red
leather
who
she
read
looking
at
the
title
and
just
then
a
card
fell
out
she
stooped
and
picked
it
up
why
it
from
that
odious
french
detective
listen
dad
the
compliments
of
andré
tellier
who
is
sure
of
mademoiselle
rushford
gratitude
send
it
back
to
him
said
her
father
or
here
give
it
to
me
i
go
down
and
smash
his
face
with
it
i
ought
to
have
kicked
him
out
of
the
house
yesterday
i
have
done
it
but
for
pelletan
wait
a
minute
dad
here
a
page
turned
down
maybe
there
something
he
wanted
me
to
see
oh
yes
it
about
lord
vernon
he
meant
the
book
for
nell
i
call
her
and
she
started
toward
the
open
door
into
the
inner
room
wait
said
her
father
instantly
what
about
vernon
read
it
she
stopped
struck
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
what
do
you
mean
dad
she
asked
paling
a
little
surely
you
mean
read
it
he
repeated
sternly
she
opened
the
book
with
hands
suddenly
tremulous
fifth
earl
of
created
she
read
in
a
low
voice
henry
augustus
gardner
baronet
viscount
vernon
baron
dalberry
viscount
cranford
baron
vernon
trustee
of
imperial
institute
born
tenth
of
may
son
of
lord
henry
augustus
gardner
son
of
fourth
earl
and
mary
daughter
of
richard
chaloner
boston
married
catherine
married
cried
her
father
and
then
restrained
himself
though
his
face
turned
crimson
but
go
on
perhaps
she
dead
no
she
is
dead
said
sue
reading
a
line
or
two
farther
then
she
closed
the
book
i
do
understand
she
said
dazedly
i
understand
he
did
seem
that
kind
of
man
at
all
dad
no
said
a
hoarse
voice
from
the
door
no
he
did
nell
nellie
dear
cried
sue
and
in
an
instant
her
arms
were
about
her
it
it
does
matter
said
nell
steadying
herself
against
the
door
striving
to
still
a
sudden
convulsive
shuddering
i
was
a
to
think
he
he
cared
of
course
he
he
was
only
amusing
himself
and
then
her
suddenly
gave
way
and
her
head
fell
forward
upon
her
sister
shoulder
but
only
for
a
moment
that
high
queenliness
was
not
on
the
surface
merely
but
in
the
heart
as
well
i
think
i
getting
tired
of
dad
she
said
quite
steadily
with
a
wan
little
smile
i
seem
to
be
hungering
for
new
york
again
would
you
like
to
go
home
we
go
of
course
at
once
dad
commanded
sue
that
the
only
thing
to
do
oh
she
cried
her
eyes
flashing
i
could
murder
such
a
man
cut
him
to
pieces
inch
by
inch
and
gloat
over
the
deed
rushford
was
very
pale
and
his
hands
were
trembling
a
little
as
he
started
for
the
door
yes
i
order
the
trunks
packed
he
said
incoherently
i
have
to
hurry
i
try
to
something
in
his
voice
caught
susie
ear
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
dad
she
called
he
paused
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
dad
come
here
he
came
back
reluctantly
we
to
go
away
quietly
you
know
without
telling
any
one
there
to
be
no
fuss
we
could
bear
that
a
tap
on
the
door
interrupted
her
rushford
opened
it
a
man
stood
without
a
german
with
complexion
like
mahogany
he
bowed
silently
and
handed
in
a
note
rushford
took
it
and
closed
the
door
it
from
markeld
he
said
looking
at
the
crest
thought
he
made
his
case
quite
emphatic
enough
i
guess
and
he
glanced
at
blushing
face
and
smiled
of
course
we
have
to
tell
him
he
added
as
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
unfolded
the
sheet
of
paper
it
contained
he
has
a
sort
of
right
he
stopped
susie
saw
his
face
turn
gray
again
a
great
fear
fell
upon
her
heart
a
cold
still
fear
that
gripped
her
and
left
her
shivering
what
is
it
dad
she
asked
quietly
through
clenched
teeth
nothing
answered
her
father
looking
at
her
vaguely
it
nothing
it
it
merely
a
matter
of
business
susie
come
dad
she
said
still
quietly
do
try
to
deceive
me
tell
me
no
matter
what
it
is
i
can
bear
it
do
you
think
i
have
any
pluck
dad
yes
i
know
you
got
pluck
susie
he
said
we
simply
made
a
mistake
my
dear
in
believing
these
blackguards
honourable
men
think
no
more
about
them
read
what
he
says
dad
he
hesitated
still
but
her
eyes
compelled
him
and
he
read
prince
of
markeld
begs
to
withdraw
his
proposal
for
the
hand
of
miss
rushford
and
that
is
all
that
is
all
susie
it
could
be
she
said
a
little
hoarsely
his
aunt
is
here
monsieur
pelletan
told
me
and
she
has
pointed
out
to
him
the
folly
of
it
i
was
silly
to
think
it
could
come
true
but
oh
and
she
dropped
sobbing
into
a
chair
her
father
stood
for
a
moment
watching
the
heaving
shoulders
then
with
a
face
hard
as
iron
he
opened
the
door
and
closed
it
softly
behind
him
chapter
xix
an
american
opinion
of
european
morals
i
tell
you
fellows
for
the
last
time
lord
vernon
was
saying
that
we
ca
keep
this
thing
up
any
longer
miss
rushford
has
served
notice
on
me
that
she
going
to
tell
and
dashed
if
i
blame
her
besides
the
note
the
note
ca
hurt
us
i
extracted
its
sting
as
for
miss
rushford
i
might
see
her
again
suggested
collins
who
had
been
pacing
nervously
up
and
down
the
room
see
her
nonsense
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
what
right
have
we
to
bother
her
she
probably
send
you
about
your
business
anyway
got
a
heart
something
that
diplomats
know
nothing
about
and
never
take
into
account
we
did
take
it
into
account
in
your
case
that
true
retorted
collins
with
covert
irony
no
you
did
said
the
other
wheeling
short
around
upon
him
nor
did
i
take
into
account
what
a
damned
scoundrelly
thing
it
was
i
was
persuaded
into
undertaking
i
tell
you
some
of
us
will
have
to
get
down
and
eat
dirt
before
this
thing
is
over
pshaw
and
collins
smiled
loftily
before
a
petty
german
princeling
vernon
turned
red
with
anger
at
the
words
but
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
there
came
a
sharp
knock
at
the
door
come
in
he
shouted
before
the
others
could
draw
breath
no
i
not
going
to
hide
he
added
in
answer
to
collins
gesture
that
farce
is
finished
the
door
opened
and
monsieur
pelletan
appeared
on
the
threshold
monsieur
le
prince
de
markeld
he
announced
and
bowed
low
as
the
prince
advanced
past
him
into
the
room
in
the
shadows
of
the
hall
glück
erect
figure
was
dimly
visible
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
but
vernon
face
was
flushing
under
the
ironical
gaze
bent
upon
it
so
said
the
prince
at
last
it
appears
that
you
are
not
you
have
been
tricking
me
all
the
time
yes
answered
vernon
not
attempting
for
an
instant
to
evade
the
question
tricking
you
that
is
the
word
i
am
glad
she
has
told
you
do
you
think
it
was
quite
the
course
for
a
gentleman
to
pursue
continued
the
prince
in
a
voice
singularly
even
no
said
vernon
quietly
i
do
not
nor
do
i
said
the
prince
again
there
was
a
moment
silence
it
was
vernon
who
broke
it
when
i
went
into
this
thing
he
began
quite
steadily
i
had
no
thought
that
it
would
result
as
it
has
it
seemed
to
me
an
innocent
deception
warranted
by
reasons
of
state
we
could
not
of
course
foresee
that
you
would
follow
us
here
instead
of
going
on
to
london
for
some
time
i
have
found
the
rôle
unbearable
but
until
a
moment
ago
i
fancied
i
might
be
able
to
explain
to
you
the
course
i
have
taken
explain
repeated
the
prince
with
bitter
emphasis
now
of
course
went
on
vernon
evenly
i
see
that
no
explanations
are
possible
that
no
apology
even
which
i
might
make
would
excuse
me
i
do
in
the
least
believe
in
duelling
i
have
always
thought
that
i
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
be
entangled
in
that
way
but
this
seems
to
be
one
of
those
situations
which
have
no
other
solution
i
am
quite
willing
anxious
even
to
give
you
any
satisfaction
you
may
demand
it
is
your
right
i
agree
with
you
said
the
prince
it
is
my
right
my
friends
will
wait
upon
you
and
he
turned
toward
the
door
but
this
is
folly
protested
collins
his
face
very
red
we
are
living
on
the
verge
of
the
twentieth
century
gentlemen
not
in
the
seventeenth
i
wo
countenance
this
madness
for
an
instant
who
asks
you
to
countenance
it
demanded
vernon
sternly
i
repeat
i
am
at
the
prince
service
i
am
glad
that
it
is
within
my
power
to
offer
him
this
reparation
very
well
said
the
prince
bowing
and
again
turned
to
the
door
but
vernon
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
before
you
go
before
i
can
meet
you
even
he
said
quietly
there
is
a
further
explanation
due
you
i
have
no
wish
to
hear
it
the
prince
broke
in
it
is
one
which
you
must
nevertheless
listen
to
went
on
vernon
coldly
confession
would
perhaps
be
a
better
word
for
it
miss
rushford
did
not
know
the
whole
truth
so
said
the
prince
with
irony
you
acted
unfairly
then
even
with
your
vernon
flushed
hotly
but
kept
himself
in
hand
the
retort
is
unworthy
of
you
he
said
i
assure
you
that
miss
rushford
was
not
in
any
sense
a
do
you
mean
that
she
was
ignorant
of
the
deception
you
were
playing
demanded
the
prince
quickly
no
she
was
not
ignorant
of
that
but
she
the
prince
held
up
his
hand
with
an
imperious
gesture
no
more
he
said
if
this
is
the
explanation
confession
what
you
will
i
repeat
that
i
do
not
care
to
hear
it
this
is
not
it
it
can
not
in
any
event
alter
matters
i
have
no
wish
that
it
should
alter
matters
your
highness
retorted
vernon
proudly
when
i
have
offered
you
the
greatest
reparation
in
my
power
it
is
ungenerous
that
you
should
again
a
knock
interrupted
him
come
in
he
called
recklessly
the
door
opened
and
archibald
rushford
entered
he
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
and
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
vernon
started
forward
why
how
are
you
mr
rushford
he
began
with
outstretched
hand
very
glad
to
see
you
oh
you
are
inquired
the
american
keeping
his
own
hands
firmly
behind
his
back
i
suppose
glad
to
see
me
too
he
added
turning
to
the
prince
i
know
of
no
reason
why
i
should
avoid
you
returned
the
prince
proudly
perhaps
not
assented
rushford
drily
the
standards
of
gentlemanly
conduct
seem
to
be
different
in
the
old
world
and
in
the
new
i
glad
however
that
i
caught
you
two
together
i
suppose
that
little
farce
of
pretended
illness
was
played
only
for
the
benefit
of
outsiders
i
assure
you
rushford
began
vernon
quickly
but
the
american
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
i
do
care
to
hear
he
said
i
care
nothing
for
your
conspiracies
and
intrigues
but
i
repeat
i
glad
i
caught
both
of
you
together
it
enables
me
to
tell
in
the
same
breath
what
i
think
of
both
of
you
and
i
am
very
anxious
to
tell
you
fully
and
completely
for
i
suppose
you
have
been
surrounded
all
your
lives
by
toadies
who
were
afraid
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
yourselves
or
who
were
so
like
you
that
they
could
see
the
truth
products
of
the
same
code
of
morals
a
code
truly
european
in
a
word
then
i
think
you
are
both
blackguards
blackguards
of
the
most
nasty
and
contemptible
kind
the
kind
that
preys
upon
women
i
may
add
that
you
have
deeply
shaken
my
faith
in
human
nature
for
to
look
at
you
one
would
mistake
you
for
gentlemen
the
words
were
uttered
quietly
evenly
deliberately
each
one
given
its
full
value
there
was
a
certain
dignity
in
rushford
aspect
which
made
interruption
impossible
but
neither
man
offered
to
interrupt
the
prince
was
biting
his
lips
desperately
vernon
turned
red
and
white
and
red
again
in
evident
amazement
and
having
said
this
concluded
the
american
as
emphatically
as
possible
i
will
very
gladly
leave
you
to
yourselves
oh
no
you
wo
cried
vernon
fiercely
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
emotion
i
at
least
demand
an
explanation
an
explanation
and
rushford
laughed
a
little
mocking
laugh
your
conscience
give
you
an
explanation
or
is
it
too
deadened
to
do
that
no
said
vernon
boldly
my
conscience
gives
me
no
explanation
which
would
in
any
degree
warrant
the
words
you
have
used
to
me
and
which
i
am
sure
you
will
some
day
regret
it
is
true
that
my
conduct
here
has
not
been
wholly
straightforward
but
it
is
prince
frederick
i
have
wronged
and
not
you
in
any
degree
your
daughter
to
whom
i
presume
you
referred
knew
all
all
repeated
rushford
with
irony
perhaps
not
all
but
i
had
intended
waiting
upon
you
this
afternoon
and
explaining
to
you
oh
so
you
thought
i
was
entitled
to
an
explanation
yes
my
lord
it
seems
to
me
that
your
actions
will
require
a
great
deal
of
explaining
more
certainly
than
i
have
the
patience
to
listen
to
so
i
pray
you
will
spare
me
i
do
know
anything
in
god
wide
world
more
contemptible
than
a
married
man
who
poses
as
single
married
shrieked
his
lordship
poses
oh
the
door
opened
and
pelletan
head
appeared
i
knocked
he
explained
obsequiously
once
twice
and
when
none
answered
mees
rushford
insiste
miss
rushford
cried
vernon
yes
monsieur
mees
rushford
and
pelletan
stepped
to
one
side
disclosing
sue
chapter
xx
the
dowager
bombshell
she
came
no
farther
than
the
threshold
and
looked
only
at
her
father
though
her
eyes
were
shining
with
the
consciousness
of
some
one
presence
in
the
room
some
one
whom
she
had
not
in
the
least
expected
to
find
there
come
dad
she
said
do
waste
your
time
here
they
not
worth
it
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
but
vernon
flung
himself
between
them
he
shall
not
go
he
cried
until
he
has
heard
me
it
is
all
a
mistake
i
see
now
where
this
detestable
adventure
in
diplomacy
has
led
me
my
dear
sir
if
i
were
what
you
think
me
i
should
deserve
every
word
you
have
uttered
to
me
and
more
but
i
am
not
married
i
have
never
been
married
i
had
hoped
wait
a
minute
interrupted
rushford
do
go
too
fast
come
here
susie
and
help
me
to
understand
could
sue
as
she
came
forward
have
seen
the
gaze
which
prince
frederick
bent
upon
her
her
heart
might
have
relented
a
little
toward
him
but
she
did
not
see
she
had
eyes
only
for
her
father
now
go
ahead
said
he
when
he
had
his
arm
safely
around
her
and
be
careful
sir
he
added
we
want
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
that
is
what
you
shall
have
said
vernon
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
it
occurs
to
me
put
in
collins
icily
that
the
story
is
not
wholly
yours
to
tell
it
is
cried
vernon
turning
upon
him
fiercely
i
suppose
i
to
permit
myself
to
remain
in
this
damnable
position
for
the
sake
of
a
lot
of
diplomats
in
our
foreign
office
they
can
go
hang
for
all
i
care
i
chuck
the
whole
thing
do
you
hear
do
you
understand
the
whole
thing
collins
turned
away
with
a
shrug
of
despair
the
situation
had
got
beyond
his
control
it
is
an
explanation
which
i
owe
to
the
prince
of
markeld
as
well
as
to
yourself
rushford
went
on
vernon
more
slowly
speaking
calmly
by
a
great
effort
and
which
i
was
just
about
to
make
to
him
when
you
came
in
i
am
not
lord
vernon
i
am
merely
his
younger
brother
i
bear
a
certain
resemblance
to
him
and
a
lot
of
persuaded
me
to
impersonate
him
here
in
order
to
leave
him
free
to
carry
out
the
negotiations
for
the
succession
to
without
being
embarrassed
by
the
representations
of
either
side
i
recall
how
he
approved
of
the
scheme
which
had
its
origin
in
the
fertile
brain
of
collins
there
i
see
the
reason
now
though
i
did
suspect
it
then
as
to
the
succession
monsieur
le
prince
for
all
i
know
the
whole
thing
may
by
this
time
be
settled
collins
could
probably
tell
you
if
he
would
it
is
not
settled
muttered
collins
so
you
see
went
on
vernon
without
heeding
him
i
have
done
you
an
even
greater
wrong
than
you
imagined
yes
said
the
prince
in
a
hoarse
voice
you
have
but
settled
or
not
said
the
other
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
i
had
enough
rushford
held
out
his
hand
with
a
quick
gesture
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
simply
i
see
that
i
was
not
mistaken
in
my
first
estimate
of
you
after
all
i
am
very
glad
i
was
coming
to
you
this
afternoon
added
the
englishman
taking
the
outstretched
hand
eagerly
to
tell
you
that
i
am
merely
viscount
cranford
and
not
lord
vernon
a
very
insignificant
fellow
not
a
great
one
and
to
ask
for
your
daughter
miss
nell
i
ask
you
now
though
first
let
me
make
it
clear
to
you
that
the
title
is
of
little
importance
the
only
title
we
americans
care
about
responded
rushford
slowly
is
that
of
gentleman
my
daughter
husband
need
have
no
other
but
he
must
have
that
we
do
give
our
daughters
away
sir
as
i
already
explained
to
susie
pinched
his
arm
viciously
in
an
agony
of
alarm
then
she
pulled
his
head
down
to
her
her
eyes
shining
and
whispered
a
quick
sentence
in
his
ear
yes
that
it
he
nodded
nell
is
waiting
for
us
our
apartment
is
just
up
the
stair
you
better
go
tell
her
the
story
young
man
knock
at
the
door
make
her
admit
you
make
her
listen
oh
a
lover
should
know
how
yes
i
see
you
do
and
god
bless
you
he
added
as
cranford
wrung
his
hand
flung
open
the
door
and
disappeared
along
the
hall
and
we
must
go
too
dad
said
sue
in
a
low
voice
at
once
come
yes
assented
her
father
yes
yet
wait
a
minute
susie
and
he
stopped
his
eyes
on
markeld
i
hate
to
think
i
done
any
other
man
the
same
injustice
i
did
that
young
englishman
perhaps
the
prince
of
markeld
has
also
an
explanation
if
so
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
susie
hand
trembled
on
her
father
arm
and
she
caught
her
breath
with
a
little
gasp
but
she
kept
her
eyes
steadily
on
the
floor
she
had
pride
enough
for
that
oh
she
rejoiced
that
she
had
pride
enough
for
that
the
prince
gazed
at
her
a
moment
then
with
face
ashy
gray
he
shook
his
head
i
have
none
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
susie
shivered
at
the
words
but
i
have
cried
some
one
from
the
door
and
turning
they
beheld
there
on
the
threshold
a
handsome
old
lady
with
hair
snowy
white
figure
erect
face
imperious
the
dowager
duchess
of
markheim
behind
her
in
the
twilight
of
the
hall
could
be
dimly
seen
the
mustachios
of
monsieur
tellier
with
glück
face
glaring
at
him
i
am
not
so
proud
she
went
on
advancing
into
the
room
i
am
quite
willing
to
give
my
reasons
for
breaking
off
the
match
is
this
the
girl
she
asked
abruptly
susie
looked
at
her
with
fiery
eyes
their
glances
crossed
one
almost
expected
to
see
the
sparks
fly
as
of
two
blades
meeting
i
am
not
continued
the
duchess
after
a
moment
but
there
are
certain
affairs
of
state
which
must
always
take
precedence
of
any
mere
personal
inclination
did
marry
to
please
myself
and
her
voice
shook
a
little
by
no
means
it
is
no
secret
yet
i
was
faithful
to
my
husband
and
to
my
house
i
have
never
regretted
it
now
all
that
i
have
left
to
love
is
that
boy
yonder
and
i
intend
to
see
that
he
makes
a
match
which
is
worthy
of
him
yes
i
love
him
but
he
must
not
degrade
his
name
not
even
for
his
happiness
it
was
solicitude
for
him
that
brought
me
here
i
feared
her
voice
broke
perhaps
she
had
a
vision
of
that
tragedy
fifty
years
ago
when
at
her
mother
side
she
had
stared
out
through
the
mists
of
the
morning
but
no
matter
she
added
hastily
may
i
ask
madame
inquired
rushford
how
marriage
with
my
daughter
would
degrade
your
nephew
it
is
impossible
in
the
first
place
she
answered
readily
that
he
should
marry
the
daughter
of
an
of
an
repeated
rushford
in
a
puzzled
tone
you
are
the
proprietor
of
this
inn
are
you
not
demanded
the
duchess
tellier
here
has
the
papers
come
forward
tellier
oh
i
understand
and
rushford
laughed
not
pleasantly
no
i
tell
you
susie
he
added
catching
his
daughter
astonished
glance
it
was
merely
an
escapade
of
mine
i
was
bored
and
so
i
arranged
with
pelletan
to
have
a
little
fun
by
backing
the
hotel
for
a
month
pelletan
had
reached
the
end
of
his
resources
he
have
had
to
shut
up
shop
and
i
did
want
to
move
i
assure
you
madame
that
at
home
i
am
not
an
if
i
was
i
should
be
in
the
least
ashamed
of
it
unless
i
were
a
bad
one
suppose
we
pass
on
to
the
next
count
there
was
a
movement
at
the
door
and
nell
came
running
to
her
father
and
threw
her
arms
about
him
cranford
followed
her
and
held
out
his
hands
congratulate
me
he
said
simply
but
with
shining
face
i
do
said
rushford
and
kissed
his
daughter
it
seems
we
got
your
difficulty
happily
settled
nell
but
we
another
on
hand
which
seems
considerably
more
complicated
now
madame
if
you
will
proceed
with
the
indictment
the
duchess
seemed
a
little
shaken
after
all
a
man
who
could
play
with
great
hotels
demanded
some
consideration
the
second
reason
is
even
more
serious
she
said
at
least
my
nephew
seemed
to
so
consider
it
he
laughed
at
the
first
one
he
is
still
young
he
still
believes
in
the
nonsense
of
the
romancers
does
he
commented
rushford
that
one
point
in
his
favour
certainly
so
he
would
have
married
my
daughter
would
he
even
though
i
did
keep
a
hotel
that
was
kind
of
him
what
the
next
count
madame
it
is
that
your
daughter
while
pretending
to
be
his
advocate
was
really
in
the
plot
against
him
a
double
traitor
to
him
because
posing
as
his
friend
in
the
plot
cried
cranford
but
that
absurd
she
was
not
in
the
plot
is
it
the
head
of
the
plot
who
is
addressing
me
inquired
the
duchess
icily
no
doubt
my
nephew
has
already
told
you
the
prince
stopped
her
the
viscount
cranford
answers
to
me
he
said
briefly
the
duchess
paled
as
she
looked
at
him
not
that
fritz
she
cried
not
that
too
late
madame
he
said
my
honour
demands
it
the
duchess
shivered
and
her
face
seemed
suddenly
to
shrink
and
age
then
she
stood
proudly
upright
what
honour
demanded
she
would
be
the
last
to
evade
perhaps
monsieur
will
deny
she
said
looking
at
cranford
coldly
that
he
wrote
this
note
to
her
and
her
sister
the
very
first
day
of
his
sojourn
here
and
she
held
out
to
him
the
slip
of
paper
cranford
took
it
and
read
it
at
a
glance
while
nell
stared
at
it
with
starting
eyes
no
he
said
i
do
deny
that
i
wrote
it
but
and
perhaps
mademoiselle
herself
will
deny
that
she
asserted
to
monsieur
tellier
that
she
did
not
know
her
rescuer
here
are
her
words
and
she
produced
a
second
note
i
deny
nothing
said
susie
proudly
and
she
looked
the
duchess
unflinchingly
in
the
face
cranford
walked
straight
over
to
the
prince
of
markeld
was
it
miss
rushford
who
told
you
he
asked
no
it
was
the
note
answered
the
prince
fiercely
which
tellier
stole
from
miss
rushford
desk
added
cranford
sternly
leaving
this
tracing
in
its
stead
and
he
took
from
his
pocketbook
a
slip
of
paper
such
methods
are
doubtless
characteristic
of
the
paris
police
but
they
seem
to
me
almost
as
unworthy
as
those
employed
by
us
you
are
right
agreed
the
prince
his
face
livid
that
dog
shall
pay
for
it
my
nephew
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
broke
in
the
duchess
sharply
it
was
i
who
secured
the
note
who
persuaded
him
to
but
the
prince
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
miss
rushford
was
not
in
the
plot
continued
cranford
earnestly
i
hope
you
will
believe
me
that
it
should
have
come
so
near
wrecking
my
own
life
was
bad
enough
that
it
should
wreck
another
an
innocent
person
that
would
be
frightful
she
warned
me
explicitly
that
she
would
no
longer
be
a
party
to
the
deception
that
she
was
going
to
tell
you
i
thought
she
had
told
you
i
remember
well
how
warmly
she
spoke
of
your
cause
how
she
detested
the
course
i
was
pursuing
how
she
made
me
ashamed
of
myself
ashamed
to
look
at
her
i
suppose
some
mistaken
notion
of
honour
held
her
back
from
telling
since
it
was
in
her
service
and
her
sister
that
i
had
disclosed
myself
a
message
for
his
lordship
said
pelletan
from
the
door
cranford
took
it
you
will
pardon
me
he
said
it
is
marked
urgent
and
he
tore
it
open
his
face
brightened
as
he
read
it
monsieur
le
prince
he
said
warmly
turning
to
markeld
i
congratulate
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
and
he
handed
him
the
message
markeld
took
the
paper
and
glanced
at
it
then
with
beaming
eyes
held
out
his
hand
and
the
duchess
looking
on
grew
suddenly
young
again
what
is
it
she
demanded
do
you
see
we
are
all
waiting
george
of
schloshold
has
just
died
of
an
apoplexy
the
prince
read
will
inform
the
prince
of
markeld
that
we
will
support
his
house
to
the
limit
of
our
power
vernon
god
be
praised
cried
the
duchess
god
be
praised
and
she
caught
at
the
door
to
keep
herself
from
falling
he
was
a
bad
man
she
added
in
another
tone
therefore
he
needs
our
prayers
i
give
monsieur
le
prince
the
congratulations
of
france
said
an
oily
voice
and
monsieur
tellier
bowed
low
oh
cried
nell
and
shrank
away
from
him
is
that
the
scoundrel
demanded
cranford
and
he
started
across
the
room
one
moment
interposed
the
prince
do
soil
your
hands
on
him
glück
he
called
raising
his
voice
and
glück
appeared
on
the
instant
his
master
indicated
tellier
with
the
motion
of
a
finger
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
glück
face
brightened
almost
into
a
smile
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
tellier
shoulder
canaille
hissed
the
latter
and
shook
the
hand
away
do
not
touch
me
do
not
defile
me
with
those
dirty
fingers
oh
i
will
go
i
have
my
task
accomplished
and
you
are
fools
imbeciles
all
all
from
that
fat
dutchman
who
thinks
his
wife
still
living
but
glück
was
again
upon
him
this
time
not
to
be
shaken
off
and
an
instant
later
he
and
his
victim
disappeared
together
into
the
shadows
of
the
hall
just
the
same
shrieked
tellier
voice
hoarsely
from
the
distance
it
was
i
who
was
right
in
every
detail
a
veritable
triumph
a
success
of
the
voice
sank
into
a
gurgle
and
was
still
pelletan
his
face
livid
clutching
blindly
at
the
wall
for
support
stumbled
forth
into
the
hall
along
the
corridor
down
the
stair
until
at
last
he
found
tellier
his
face
purple
rearranging
his
cravat
before
a
mirror
in
the
hotel
office
iss
she
not
lifing
he
asked
huskily
living
echoed
tellier
whirling
upon
him
fiercely
no
she
has
been
dead
these
three
years
but
you
are
no
more
a
than
those
others
oh
they
shall
answer
they
shall
repay
they
shall
atone
i
will
have
my
revenge
but
pelletan
did
not
stop
to
listen
he
groped
his
way
across
the
room
his
eyes
shining
his
lips
trembling
repeating
over
and
over
a
single
word
paris
paris
paris
behind
the
desk
he
stumbled
through
the
little
door
and
dropped
to
his
knees
before
saint
genevieve
the
protector
of
the
city
which
he
loved
you
haf

he
murmured
looking
up
at
her
with
limpid
eyes
you

seen
how

suffered

chapter

pardon
as
tellier
voice
died
away
along
the
hall
a
silence
fell
upon
the
room
which
he
had
left
a
silence
from
which
the
duchess
was
the
first
to
rouse
herself
come
fritz
she
said
we
must
go
we
have
work
to
do
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
took
a
step
toward
her
hesitated
stopped
in
a
moment
madame
said
he
before
i
go
i
have
an
apology
to
make
and
a
pardon
to
crave
of
whom
demanded
the
duchess
for
answer
the
prince
turned
to
susie
so
near
that
he
almost
touched
her
so
near
that
she
could
see
the
trembling
of
his
hands
the
throbbing
of
his
heart
miss
rushford
he
said
in
a
voice
low
carefully
repressed
but
vibrant
with
emotion
i
know
that
i
have
played
the
scoundrel
i
know
that
i
have
no
right
whatever
to
address
you
i
know
that
i
have
done
everything
i
could
to
forfeit
your
respect
believe
me
the
cup
is
bitter
the
more
so
since
i
myself
prepared
it
his
voice
was
trembling
so
that
for
the
moment
he
could
not
go
on
no
no
cried
the
duchess
from
the
door
you
wrong
yourself
fritz
it
was
i
prepared
it
it
is
i
who
am
to
blame
but
he
motioned
her
to
silence
it
was
i
prepared
it
he
repeated
by
my
unjust
suspicions
and
ungentlemanly
action
i
shall
drain
it
with
what
manhood
i
have
and
i
hope
mademoiselle
that
you
will
in
time
find
it
in
your
heart
to
pardon
me
and
to
think
of
me
with
kindness
i
can
only
repeat
to
you
what
i
have
already
told
your
father
that
i
love
you
truly
and
deeply
with
my
whole
heart
as
i
shall
always
love
you
always
oh
if
i
had
not
been
a
fool
the
duchess
looking
on
from
the
door
felt
a
sudden
wave
of
tenderness
sweep
over
her
perhaps
she
recalled
her
own
youth
perhaps
it
was
not
quite
the
truth
that
she
had
never
regretted
perhaps
she
was
softened
by
the
emotions
of
the
moment
she
came
to
susie
and
took
her
hand
in
hers
mademoiselle
she
said
softly
i
also
ask
pardon
you
will
not
bear
against
an
old
woman
who
imagined
that
she
was
acting
wisely
i
feel
that
i
am
going
to
love
you
you
have
spirit
you
are
worthy
to
be
even
a
markeld
you
must
forgive
that
poor
boy
yonder
i
think
i
shall
put
him
on
probation
said
susie
glancing
up
with
bright
eyes
into
the
eager
face
beside
her
the
prince
sank
to
his
knee
his
face
suddenly
radiant
with
joy
caught
her
hand
and
covered
it
with
kisses
six
months
a
year
ten
years
he
cried
i
shall
be
content
ten
years
nonsense
cried
the
duchess
ten
days
mademoiselle
you
do
not
love
him
if
you
make
it
an
instant
longer
no
not
ten
days
madame
corrected
susie
with
a
laugh
that
was
half
a
sob
let
us
say
ten
minutes
