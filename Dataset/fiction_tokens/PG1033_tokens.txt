up

a
turrible
smart
driver
he
had
certainly
taken
chances
in
a
twinkling
he
was
in
the
water
rose
i
take
you
safely
hiding
her
face
as
he
flung
it
down
the
she
had
gone
with
maude
to
claude
store
as
long
as
stephen
waterman
alive
rose
wiley
can
have
him
do
speak
stephen
till
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
the
pine
and
the
rose
it
was
not
long
after
sunrise
and
stephen
waterman
fresh
from
his
dip
in
the
river
had
scrambled
up
the
hillside
from
the
hut
in
the
where
he
had
made
his
morning
toilet
an
early
ablution
of
this
sort
was
not
the
custom
of
the
farmers
along
the
banks
of
the
saco
but
the
waterman
house
was
hardly
a
stone
throw
from
the
water
and
there
was
a
clear
deep
in
the
willow
cove
that
would
have
tempted
the
busiest
man
or
the
least
cleanly
in
york
county
then
too
stephen
was
a
child
of
the
river
born
reared
schooled
on
its
very
brink
never
happy
unless
he
were
on
it
or
in
it
or
beside
it
or
at
least
within
sight
or
sound
of
it
the
immensity
of
the
sea
had
always
silenced
and
overawed
him
left
him
cold
in
feeling
the
river
wooed
him
caressed
him
won
his
heart
it
was
just
big
enough
to
love
it
was
full
of
charms
and
changes
of
varying
moods
and
sudden
surprises
its
voice
stole
in
upon
his
ear
with
a
melody
far
sweeter
and
more
subtle
than
the
boom
of
the
ocean
yet
it
was
not
without
strength
and
when
it
was
swollen
with
the
freshets
of
the
spring
and
brimming
with
the
bounty
of
its
sister
streams
it
could
dash
and
roar
boom
and
crash
with
the
best
of
them
stephen
stood
on
the
side
porch
drinking
in
the
glory
of
the
sunrise
with
the
saco
winding
like
a
silver
ribbon
through
the
sweet
loveliness
of
the
summer
landscape
and
the
river
rolled
on
toward
the
sea
singing
its
morning
song
creating
and
nourishing
beauty
at
every
step
of
its
onward
path
cradled
in
the
heart
of
a
great
it
pursued
its
gleaming
way
here
lying
silent
in
glassy
lakes
there
rushing
into
tinkling
little
falls
foaming
great
falls
and
thundering
cataracts
scores
of
bridges
spanned
its
width
but
no
steamers
flurried
its
crystal
depths
here
and
there
a
rough
little
rowboat
tethered
to
a
willow
rocked
to
and
fro
in
some
quiet
bend
of
the
shore
here
the
silver
gleam
of
a
rising
perch
chub
or
trout
caught
the
eye
there
a
pickerel
lay
rigid
in
the
clear
water
a
fish
carved
in
stone
here
eels
coiled
in
the
muddy
bottom
of
some
pool
and
there
under
the
deep
shadows
of
the
rocks
lay
fat
sleepy
bass
old
and
incredibly
wise
quite
untempted
by
and
wholly
superior
to
the
rural
fisherman
worm
the
river
lapped
the
shores
of
peaceful
meadows
it
flowed
along
banks
green
with
maple
beech
sycamore
and
birch
it
fell
tempestuously
over
dams
and
fought
its
way
between
rocky
cliffs
crowned
with
stately
firs
it
rolled
past
forests
of
pine
and
hemlock
and
spruce
now
gentle
now
terrible
for
there
is
said
to
be
an
indian
curse
upon
the
saco
whereby
with
every
great
sun
the
child
of
a
paleface
shall
be
drawn
into
its
cruel
depths
lashed
into
fury
by
the
stony
reefs
that
impeded
its
progress
the
river
looked
now
sapphire
now
gold
now
white
now
leaden
gray
but
always
it
was
hurrying
hurrying
on
its
appointed
way
to
the
sea
after
feasting
his
eyes
and
filling
his
heart
with
a
morning
draught
of
beauty
stephen
went
in
from
the
porch
and
pausing
at
the
stairway
called
in
stentorian
tones
get
up
and
eat
your
breakfast
rufus
the
boys
will
be
picking
the
side
jams
and
i
going
down
to
work
on
the
logs
if
you
come
along
bring
your
own
and
peavey
then
going
to
the
kitchen
pantry
he
collected
from
the
various
shelves
a
pitcher
of
milk
a
loaf
of
bread
half
an
and
a
bowl
of
blueberries
and
with
the
easy
methods
of
a
household
unswayed
by
feminine
rule
moved
toward
a
seat
under
an
and
took
his
morning
meal
in
great
apparent
content
having
finished
and
washed
his
dishes
with
much
more
thoroughness
than
is
common
to
unsuperintended
man
and
having
given
rufus
the
second
call
to
breakfast
with
the
vigor
and
acrimony
that
usually
marks
that
unpleasant
performance
he
strode
to
a
high
point
on
the
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
gazed
steadily
down
stream
patches
of
green
fodder
and
blossoming
potatoes
melted
into
soft
fields
that
had
been
lately
mown
and
there
were
glimpses
of
tasseling
corn
rising
high
to
catch
the
sun
far
far
down
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
was
the
hint
of
a
brown
roof
and
the
tip
of
a
chimney
that
sent
a
slender
wisp
of
smoke
into
the
clear
air
beyond
this
and
farther
back
from
the
water
the
trees
apparently
hid
a
cluster
of
other
chimneys
for
thin
spirals
of
smoke
ascended
here
and
there
the
little
brown
roof
could
never
have
revealed
itself
to
any
but
a
lover
eye
and
that
discerned
something
even
smaller
something
like
a
pinkish
speck
that
moved
hither
and
thither
on
a
piece
of
greensward
that
sloped
to
the
waterside
she
up
stephen
exclaimed
under
his
breath
his
eyes
shining
his
lips
smiling
his
voice
had
a
note
of
hushed
exaltation
about
it
as
if
she
whoever
she
might
be
had
in
condescending
to
rise
conferred
a
priceless
boon
upon
a
waiting
universe
if
she
were
indeed
a
up
so
his
tone
implied
then
the
day
somewhat
falsely
heralded
by
the
sunrise
had
really
begun
and
the
human
race
might
pursue
its
appointed
tasks
inspired
and
uplifted
by
the
consciousness
of
her
existence
it
might
properly
be
grateful
for
the
fact
of
her
birth
that
she
had
grown
to
woman
estate
and
above
all
that
in
common
with
the
sun
the
lark
the
and
other
beautiful
things
of
the
early
day
she
was
up
and
about
her
lovely
cheery
business
illustration
she
up
the
handful
of
chimneys
and
the
smoke
spirals
rising
here
and
there
among
the
trees
on
the
belonged
to
what
was
known
as
the
brier
neighborhood
there
were
only
a
few
houses
in
all
scattered
along
a
side
road
leading
from
the
river
up
to
liberty
centre
there
were
no
great
signs
of
thrift
or
prosperity
but
the
wiley
cottage
the
only
one
near
the
water
was
neat
and
well
cared
for
and
nature
had
done
her
best
to
conceal
man
indolence
poverty
or
neglect
bushes
of
sweetbrier
grew
in
fragrant
little
forests
as
tall
as
the
fences
clumps
of
wild
roses
sprang
up
at
every
turn
and
over
all
the
stone
walls
as
well
as
on
every
heap
of
rocks
by
the
wayside
prickly
blackberry
vines
ran
and
clambered
and
clung
yielding
fruit
and
thorns
impartially
to
the
neighborhood
children
the
pinkish
speck
that
stephen
waterman
had
spied
from
his
side
of
the
river
was
rose
wiley
of
the
brier
neighborhood
on
the
edgewood
side
as
there
was
another
of
her
name
on
brigadier
hill
the
edgewood
minister
called
one
of
them
the
climbing
rose
and
the
other
the
brier
rose
or
sometimes
rose
of
the
river
she
was
well
named
the
pinkish
speck
she
had
not
only
some
of
the
sweetest
attributes
of
the
wild
rose
but
the
parallel
might
have
been
extended
as
far
as
the
thorns
for
she
had
wounded
her
scores
hearts
be
it
understood
not
hands
the
wounding
was
on
the
whole
very
innocently
done
and
if
fault
could
be
imputed
anywhere
it
might
rightly
have
been
laid
at
the
door
of
the
kind
powers
who
had
made
her
what
she
was
since
the
smile
that
blesses
a
single
heart
is
always
destined
to
break
many
more
she
had
not
a
single
silk
gown
but
she
had
what
is
far
better
a
figure
to
show
off
a
cotton
one
not
a
brooch
nor
a
pair
of
earrings
was
numbered
among
her
possessions
but
any
ordinary
gems
would
have
looked
rather
dull
and
trivial
when
compelled
to
undergo
comparison
with
her
bright
eyes
as
to
her
hair
the
local
milliner
declared
it
impossible
for
rose
wiley
to
get
an
unbecoming
hat
that
on
one
occasion
being
in
a
frolicsome
mood
rose
had
tried
on
all
the
headgear
in
the
village
emporium
children
gingham
shakers
mourning
bonnets
for
aged
dames
men
haying
hats
and
visored
caps
and
she
proved
superior
to
every
test
looking
as
pretty
as
a
pink
in
the
best
ones
and
simply
ravishing
in
the
worst
in
fact
she
had
been
so
fashioned
and
finished
by
nature
that
had
she
been
set
on
a
revolving
pedestal
in
a
the
bystanders
would
have
exclaimed
as
each
new
charm
came
into
view
look
at
her
waist
see
her
shoulders
and
her
neck
and
chin
and
her
hair
while
the
children
gazing
with
raptured
admiration
would
have
shrieked
in
unison
i
choose
her
for
mine
all
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
rose
of
the
river
was
a
beauty
yet
it
quite
fails
to
explain
nevertheless
the
secret
of
her
power
when
she
looked
her
worst
the
spell
was
as
potent
as
when
she
looked
her
best
hidden
away
somewhere
was
a
vital
spark
which
warmed
every
one
who
came
in
contact
with
it
her
lovely
little
person
was
a
trifle
below
medium
height
and
it
might
as
well
be
confessed
that
her
soul
on
the
morning
when
stephen
waterman
saw
her
hanging
out
the
clothes
on
the
river
bank
was
not
large
enough
to
be
at
all
out
of
proportion
but
when
eyes
and
dimples
lips
and
cheeks
enslave
the
onlooker
the
soul
is
seldom
subjected
to
a
close
or
critical
scrutiny
besides
rose
wiley
was
a
nice
girl
neat
as
wax
energetic
merry
amiable
economical
she
was
a
dutiful
granddaughter
to
two
of
the
most
irritating
old
people
in
the
county
she
never
patronized
her
girl
friends
she
made
wonderful
pies
and
doughnuts
and
besides
small
souls
if
they
are
of
the
right
sort
sometimes
have
a
way
of
growing
to
the
discomfiture
of
cynics
and
the
gratification
of
the
angels
so
on
one
bank
of
the
river
grew
the
brier
rose
a
fragile
thing
swaying
on
a
slender
stalk
and
looking
at
its
pretty
reflection
in
the
water
and
on
the
other
a
sturdy
pine
tree
well
rooted
against
wind
and
storm
and
the
sturdy
pine
yearned
for
the
wild
rose
and
the
rose
so
far
as
it
knew
yearned
for
nothing
at
all
certainly
not
for
rugged
pine
trees
standing
tall
and
grim
in
rocky
soil
if
in
its
present
stage
of
development
it
gravitated
toward
anything
in
particular
it
would
have
been
a
white
birch
growing
on
an
irreproachable
lawn
and
the
river
now
deep
now
shallow
now
smooth
now
tumultuous
now
sparkling
in
sunshine
now
gloomy
under
clouds
rolled
on
to
the
engulfing
sea
it
could
not
stop
to
concern
itself
with
the
petty
comedies
and
tragedies
that
were
being
enacted
along
its
shores
else
it
would
never
have
reached
its
destination
only
last
night
under
a
full
moon
there
had
been
pairs
of
lovers
leaning
over
the
rails
of
all
the
bridges
along
its
course
but
that
was
a
common
sight
like
that
of
the
ardent
couples
sitting
on
its
shady
banks
these
summer
days
looking
only
into
each
other
eyes
but
exclaiming
about
the
beauty
of
the
water
lovers
would
come
and
go
sometimes
reappearing
with
successive
installments
of
loves
in
a
way
wholly
mysterious
to
the
river
meantime
it
had
its
own
work
to
do
and
must
be
about
it
for
the
side
jams
were
to
be
broken
and
the
boom
let
out
at
the
edgewood
bridge
old
kennebec
it
was
just
seven
that
same
morning
when
rose
wiley
smoothed
the
last
wrinkle
from
her
dimity
counterpane
picked
up
a
shred
of
from
the
spotless
floor
under
the
bed
slapped
a
mosquito
on
the
removed
all
signs
of
murder
with
a
moist
towel
and
before
running
down
to
breakfast
cast
a
frowning
look
at
her
pincushion
almira
otherwise
mite
shapley
had
been
in
her
room
the
afternoon
before
and
disturbed
with
her
careless
hand
the
pattern
of
rose
pins
they
were
kept
religiously
in
the
form
of
a
maltese
cross
and
if
while
she
was
extricating
one
from
her
clothing
there
had
been
an
alarm
of
fire
rose
would
have
stuck
the
pin
in
its
appointed
place
in
the
design
at
the
risk
of
losing
her
life
entering
the
kitchen
with
her
light
step
she
brought
the
morning
sunshine
with
her
the
old
people
had
already
engaged
in
differences
of
opinion
but
they
commonly
suspended
open
warfare
in
her
presence
there
were
the
usual
last
things
to
be
done
for
breakfast
offices
that
belonged
to
her
as
her
grandmother
assistant
she
took
soda
biscuits
out
of
the
steamer
where
they
were
warming
and
softening
brought
an
apple
pie
and
a
plate
of
seed
cakes
from
the
pantry
settled
the
coffee
with
a
piece
of
dried
fish
skin
and
an
egg
shell
and
transferred
some
fried
potatoes
from
the
spider
to
a
covered
dish
did
you
remember
the
meat
grandpa
we
all
out
she
said
as
she
began
buttoning
a
stiff
collar
around
his
reluctant
neck

his
wife
responded
with
the
snap
of
a
dish
towel
or
if
you
do
they
wilt
with
the
heat
rose
smiled
but
the
soft
hand
with
which
she
tied
the
about
the
old
man
withered
neck
pacified
his
spirit
and
he
smiled
knowingly
back
at
her
as
she
took
her
seat
at
the
breakfast
table
spread
near
the
open
kitchen
door
she
was
a
dazzling
rose
and
it
is
to
be
feared
a
wasted
one
for
there
was
no
one
present
to
observe
her
clean
pink
calico
and
the
still
more
subtle
note
struck
in
the
green
ribbon
which
was
tied
round
her
throat
the
ribbon
that
formed
a
sort
of
calyx
out
of
which
sprang
the
flower
of
her
face
as
fresh
and
radiant
as
if
it
had
bloomed

morning

dennett
one
of
when

drivin
there
lots
o
folks
as
have
made
a
good
livin
by
mindin
their
own
business
observed
the
still
sententious
wiley
as
she
speared
a
with
her
fork
mindin
your
own
business
is
a
turrible
selfish
trade
responded
her
husband
loftily
if
your
neighbor
is
more
ignorant
than
what
you
are
if
he
as
ignorant
as
cooper
cow
you
ought
as
a
kennebec
man
an
a
christian
to
set
him
on
the
right
track
though
it
always
a
turrible
risky
thing
to
do
rose
grandfather
was
called
by
the
irreverent
younger
generation
sometimes
turrible
wiley
and
sometimes
old
kennebec
because
of
the
frequency
with
which
these
words
appeared
in
his
conversation
there
were
not
wanting
those
of
late
who
dubbed
him
uncle
ananias
for
reasons
too
obvious
to
mention
after
a
long
indolent
tolerably
truthful
and
useless
life
he
had
at
lost
sight
of
the
dividing
line
between
fact
and
fancy
and
drew
on
his
imagination
to
such
an
extent
that
he
almost
staggered
himself
when
he
began
to
indulge
in
reminiscence
he
was
a
feature
of
the
edgewood
drive
being
always
present
during
the
five
or
six
days
that
it
was
in
progress
sometimes
sitting
on
the
sometimes
leaning
over
the
bridge
sometimes
reclining
against
the
of
a
huge
log
but
always
chewing
tobacco
and
expectorating
to
incredible
distances
as
he
criticized
and
damned
impartially
all
the
expedients
in
use
at
the
particular
moment
i
want
to
stay
down
by
the
river
this
afternoon
said

said
her
grandmother
though
it
an
awful
lazy
way
of
spendin
an
afternoon
when
i
was
a
girl
there
was
no
such
dawdlin
goin
on
i
can
tell
you
nobody
thought
o
at
the
river
in
them
days
there
was
time
but
it
such
fun
to
watch
the
logs
rose
exclaimed
next
to
dancing
the
greatest
fun
in
the
world
as
all
the
young
men
in
town
will
be
there
watchin
too
was
the
grandmother
reply
eben
brooks

richard

diplomas
in
their
pockets
brooks

eben

in
a
class
o
an
seemed
proud
of
him
an
i
guess
it
is
the
first
time
he
ever
stood
anywheres
but
at
the
foot
i
tell
you
when
these
new
doctors
git
scattered
over
the
country
there
be
many
folks
keepin
house
under
ground
dick
bean
goin
to
stop
a
spell
with
rufe
an
steve
waterman
that
make
one
more
to
play
in
the
river
rufus
ai
hardly
got
his
workin
legs
on
yit
allowed
wiley
but
steve
all
right
he
a
turrible
smart
driver
an
turrible
reckless
too
he
take
all
the
chances
there
is
though
to
a
man
that
lived
on
the
kennebec
there
ai
what
can
rightly
be
called
any
turrible
chances
on
the
saco
he
better
be
to
his
farm
objected
wiley
illustration
he
a
turrible
smart
driver
his
hay
is
all
in
rose
spoke
up
quickly
and
he
only
helps
on
the
river
when
the
farm
work
is
pressing
besides
though
it
all
play
to
him
he
earns
his
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
day
he
do
keer
about
the
two
and
a
half
said
her
grandfather
he
jest
ca
keep
away
from
the
logs
there
some
that
ca
when
i
first
moved
here
from
where
the
climate
never
suited
me
the
climate
of
any
place
where
you
hev
regular
work
never
did
an
never
will
suit
you
remarked
the
old
man
wife
but
the
interruption
received
no
comment
such
mistaken
views
of
his
character
were
too
frequent
to
make
any
impression
as
i
was
sayin
rose
he
continued
when
we
first
moved
here
from
we
lived
neighbor
to
the
watermans
steve
an
rufus
was
little
boys
then
always
playin
with
a
couple
o
wild
cousins
o
theirn
older
steve
would
scare
his
mother
pretty
nigh
to
death
stealin
away
to
the
mill
to
ride
on
the
o
the
log
that
was
bein
sawed
hitchin
clean
out
over
the
river
an
then
back
into
the
jaws
o
the
machinery
he
never
hed
any
common
sense
to
spare
even
when
he
was
a
young
one
remarked
wiley
and
i
do
see
as
all
the
education
his
father
throwed
away
on
him
has
changed
him
much
and
with
this
observation
she
rose
from
the
table
and
went
to
the
sink
steve
ai
nobody
fool
dissented
the
old
man
but
he
kind
daft
about
the
river
when
he
was
little
he
was
allers
buildin
dams
in
the
brook
an
sailin
chips
an
runnin
on
the
logs
allers
up
stickins
an
raftin
together
in
the
pond
i
waterman
died
afore
her
time
jest
from
fright
lookin
out
the
winders
and
seein
her
boys
slippin
between
the
logs
an
their
daily
dousin
she
could
understand
it
an
there
a
heap
things
never
do
an
never
can
understand
jest
because
they
air
one
o
the
things
is
men
i
interrupted
wiley
men
in
general
but
more
husbands
assented
old
kennebec
howsomever
there
another
thing
they
do
an
ca
never
take
in
an
that
sport
steve
does
river
drivin
as
he
would
horseracin
or
or
dancin
an
he
always
did
from
a
boy
when
he
was
about
twelve
or
fifteen
he
used
to
help
the
spring
and
fall
he
could
do
nothin
but
shin
up
an
down
the
rocks
after
hammers
an
hatchets
an
ropes
but
he
was
turrible
pleased
with
his
job
they
used
to
call
him
them
days
stephanfetchit
waterman
good
name
for
him
yet
came
in
acid
tones
from

heightened
color
but
with
no

of
her
habitual
then
when
he
graduated
from
errants
went
on
the
crafty
old
man
who
knew
that
when
breakfast

begin
steve
used
to
get
cents
a
day
helpin
clear
up

turrible
smart

steve
would

be
drownded
that
what

prophesied
wiley
if
rose
encourages
him
in
such
silly
foolishness
as
ridin

as
how
steve

as
made
it
turrible
onsettlin
to
inspeck

motives
too
turrible
close
riding
a
log
is
no
more
to
steve
than
riding
a
horse
so
he
says
interposed
rose
to
change
the
subject
but
i
tell
him
that
a
horse
does
revolve
under
you
and
go
sideways
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
going
forwards
ai
no
trick
at
all
to
a
man
of
sperit
said
wiley
there
a
few
places
in
the
kennebec
where
the
water
too
shaller
to
let
the
logs
float
so
we
used
to
build
a
flume
an
the
logs
would
whiz
down
like
arrers
shot
from
a
bow
the
boys
used
to
collect
by
the
side
o
that
there
flume
to
see
me
ride
a
log
down
an
i
watched
drop
in
a
dead
faint
when
i
spun
by
the
crowd
but

you

an

put

cream
in

churn
an
you

work
off
some
o
your
steam
by
bringin
the
butter
for
us
afore
you
start
for
the
bridge
it
do
do
no
good
to
brag
afore
your
own
work
goes
stories
at
every
place
the
loafers
bench
at
the
tavern
and
the
baffled
raconteur
who
had
never
done
a
piece
of
work
cheerfully
in
his
life
dragged
himself
reluctantly
to
the
shed
where
before
long
one
could
hear
him
moving
the
dasher
up
and
down
sedately
to
his
favorite
churning
tune
of
broad
is
the
road
that
leads
to
death
and
thousands
walk
together
there
but
wisdom
shows
a
narrow
path
with
here
and
there
a
traveler
the
edgewood
drive
just
where
the
bridge
knits
together
the
two
little
villages
of
pleasant
river
and
edgewood
the
glassy
mirror
of
the
saco
broadens
suddenly
sweeping
over
the
dam
in
a
luminous
torrent
gushes
of
pure
amber
mark
the
middle
of
the
dam
with
crystal
and
silver
at
the
sides
and
from
the
seething
vortex
beneath
the
golden
cascade
the
white
spray
dashes
up
in
fountains
in
the
crevices
and
hollows
of
the
rocks
the
mad
water
churns
itself
into
snowy
froth
while
the
torrent
deep
strong
and
troubled
to
its
heart
sweeps
majestically
under
the
bridge
then
dashes
between
wooded
shores
piled
high
with
steep
masses
of
rock
or
torn
and
riven
by
great
gorges
there
had
been
much
rain
during
the
summer
and
the
saco
was
very
high
so
on
the
third
day
of
the
edgewood
drive
there
was
considerable
excitement
at
the
bridge
and
a
goodly
audience
of
villagers
from
both
sides
of
the
river
there
were
some
who
never
came
some
who
had
no
fancy
for
the
sight
some
to
whom
it
was
an
old
story
some
who
were
too
busy
but
there
were
many
to
whom
it
was
the
event
of
events
a
source
of
interest
above
the
fall
covering
the
placid
surface
of
the
river
thousands
of
logs
lay
quietly
in
boom
until
the
turning
out
process
on
the
last
day
of
the
drive
should
release
them
and
give
them
their
chance
of
display
their
brief
moment
of
notoriety
their
opportunity
of
interesting
amusing
exciting
and
exasperating
the
onlookers
by
their
antics
heaps
of
logs
had
been
cast
up
on
the
rocks
below
the
dam
where
they
lay
in
hopeless
confusion
adding
nothing
however
to
the
problem
of
the
moment
for
they
too
bided
their
time
if
they
had
possessed
wisdom
discretion
and
caution
they
might
have
slipped
gracefully
over
the
falls
and
steering
clear
of
the
hidden
ledges
about
which
it
would
seem
they
must
have
heard
whispers
from
the
old
pine
trees
along
the
river
have
kept
a
straight
course
and
reached
their
destination
without
costing
the
edgewood
lumber
company
a
small
fortune
or
if
they
had
inclined
toward
a
jolly
and
adventurous
career
they
could
have
joined
one
of
the
various
jams
or
bungs
stimulated
by
the
thought
that
any
one
of
them
might
be
a
holding
for
a
time
the
entire
mass
in
its
despotic
power
but
they
had
been
stranded
early
in
the
game
and
after
lying
high
and
dry
for
weeks
would
be
picked
off
one
by
one
and
sent
in
the
tumultuous
boil
the
foaming
hubbub
and
flurry
at
the
foot
of
the
falls
one
enormous
peeled
log
wallowed
up
and
down
like
a
huge
rhinoceros
greatly
pleasing
the
children
by
its
clumsy
cavortings
some
conflict
of
opposing
forces
kept
it
ever
in
motion
yet
never
set
it
free
below
the
bridge
were
always
the
real
the
scenes
of
the
first
and
the
fiercest
conflicts
a
ragged
ledge
of
rock
standing
well
above
the
yeasty
torrent
marked
the
middle
of
the
river
stephen
had
been
stranded
there
once
just
at
dusk
on
a
stormy
afternoon
in
spring
a
jam
had
broken
under
the
men
and
stephen
having
taken
too
great
risks
had
been
caught
on
the
moving
mass
and
leaping
from
log
to
log
his
only
chance
for
life
had
been
to
find
a
footing
on
gray
rock
which
was
nearer
than
the
shore
rufus
was
ill
at
the
time
and
waterman
so
anxious
and
nervous
that
processions
of
boys
had
to
be
sent
up
to
the
river
farm
giving
the
frightened
mother
the
latest
bulletins
of
her
son
welfare
luckily
the
river
was
narrow
just
at
the
gray
rock
and
it
was
a
quite
possible
task
though
no
easy
one
to
lash
two
ladders
together
and
make
a
narrow
bridge
on
which
the
drenched
and
shivering
man
could
reach
the
shore
there
were
loud
cheers
when
stephen
ran
lightly
across
the
slender
pathway
that
led
to
safety
ran
so
fast
that
the
ladders
had
scarce
time
to
bend
beneath
his
weight
he
had
certainly
taken
chances
but
when
did
he
not
do
that
the
logger
life
is
one
of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
and
stephen
welcomed
with
wildqq
exhilaration
every
hazard
that
came
in
his
path
to
him
there
was
never
a
dull
hour
from
the
moment
that
the
first
notch
was
cut
in
the
tree
for
he
sometimes
joined
the
boys
in
the
lumber
camp
just
for
a
frolic
till
the
later
one
when
the
hewn
log
reached
its
final
destination
he
knew
nothing
of
tooling
a
through
narrow
lanes
or
crowded
thoroughfares
nothing
of
guiding
a
horse
over
the
hedges
and
through
the
pitfalls
of
a
stiff
bit
of
hunting
country
his
steed
was
the
rearing
plunging
kicking
log
and
he
rode
it
like
a
river
god
illustration
he
had
certainly
taken
chances
the
crowd
loves
daring
and
so
it
welcomed
stephen
with
braves
but
it
knew
as
he
knew
that
he
was
only
doing
his
duty
by
the
company
only
showing
the
saco
that
man
was
master
only
keeping
the
old
waterman
name
in
good
repute
ye
ca
drownd
some
folks
old
kennebec
had
said
as
he
stood
in
a
group
on
the
shore
not
without
you
tie
an
drop
in
the
great
eddy
i
the
same
kind
i
remember
when
i
was
stranded
on
jest
sech
a
rock
in
the
kennebec
only
they
left
me
there
all
night
for
dead
an
i
had
to
swim
the
rapids
when
it
come
daylight
we
well
acquainted
with
that
rock
and
them
rapids
exclaimed
one
of
the
to
the
delight
of
the
company
rose
had
reason
to
remember
stephen
adventure
for
he
had
clambered
up
the
bank
smiling
and
blushing
under
the
hurrahs
of
the
boys
and
coming
to
the
wagon
where
she
sat
waiting
for
her
grandfather
had
seized
a
moment
to
whisper
did
you
care
whether
i
came
across
safe
rose
say
you
did
stephen
recalled
that
question
too
on
this
august
morning
perhaps
because
this
was
to
be
a
day
and
sometime
when
he
had
a
free
moment
sometime
before
supper
when
he
and
rose
were
sitting
apart
from
the
others
watching
the
logs
he
intended
again
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
this
thought
trembled
in
him
stirring
the
deeps
of
his
heart
like
a
great
wave
almost
sweeping
him
off
his
feet
when
he
held
it
too
close
and
let
it
have
full
sway
it
would
be
the
fourth
time
that
he
had
asked
rose
this
question
of
all
questions
but
there
was
no
perceptible
difference
in
his
excitement
for
there
was
always
the
possible
chance
that
she
might
change
her
mind
and
say
yes
if
only
for
variety
wanting
a
thing
continuously
unchangingly
unceasingly
year
after
year
he
thought
longing
to
reach
it
as
the
river
longed
to
reach
the
sea
such
wanting
might
in
course
of
time
mean
having
rose
drove
up
to
the
bridge
with
the
men
luncheon
and
the
under
boss
came
up
to
take
the
baskets
and
boxes
from
the
back
of
the
wagon
we
had
a
tussle
this
mornin
rose
he
said
the
logs
are
determined
not
to
move
ike
billings
that
the
and
fluentest
swearer
on
the
saco
has
tried
his
best
on
the
side
jam
he
all
out
o
and
there
hai
a
log
budged
now
stid
o
this
afternoon
an
lettin
the
oxen
haul
off
all
them
stubborn
logs
by
main
force
we
goin
to
ask
you
to
set
up
on
the
bank
and
smile
at
the
jam
she
can
do
it
says
ike
a
minute
ago
rose
starts
smilin
he
says
ai
a
jam
nor
a
bung
in
me
that
do
melt
like
wax
and
jest
float
right
off
same
as
the
logs
do
when
they
get
into
quiet
sunny
water
rose
blushed
and
laughed
and
drove
up
the
hill
to
mite
shapley
where
she
put
up
the
horse
and
waited
till
the
men
had
eaten
their
luncheon
the
drivers
slept
and
had
breakfast
and
supper
at
the
billings
house
a
mile
down
river
but
for
several
years
wiley
had
furnished
the
noon
meal
sending
it
down
piping
hot
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
the
boys
always
said
that
up
or
down
the
whole
length
of
the
saco
there
was
no
such
cooking
as
the
wileys
and
much
of
this
praise
was
earned
by
rose
serving
it
was
the
old
grandmother
who
burnished
the
tin
plates
and
dippers
till
they
looked
like
silver
for
crotchety
and
as
she
was
she
never
allowed
rose
to
spoil
her
hands
with
soft
soap
and
sand
but
it
was
rose
who
planned
and
packed
rose
who
hemmed
squares
of
old
white
tablecloths
and
sheets
to
line
the
baskets
and
keep
things
daintily
separate
rose
also
whose
tarts
and
cakes
were
the
pride
and
admiration
of
church
sociables
and
sewing
societies
where
could
such
smoking
pots
of
beans
be
found
a
murmur
of
ecstatic
approval
ran
through
the
crowd
when
the
covers
were
removed
pieces
of
sweet
pork
glistened
like
varnished
mahogany
on
the
top
of
the
beans
and
underneath
were
such
deeps
of
fragrant
juice
as
come
only
from
slow
fires
and
long
quiet
hours
in
brick
ovens
who
else
could
steam
and
bake
such
mealy
leaves
of
brown
bread
brown
as
yet
with
no
suspicion
of
sogginess
who
such
big
feathery
tasting
of
cream
and
hardly
needing
butter
and
pies
could
such
candied
lower
crusts
be
found
elsewhere
or
more
delectable
filling
or
such
rich
nutty
doughnuts
doughnuts
that
had
spurned
the
hot
fat
which
is
the
ruin
of
so
many

stephen
had
been
looking
intently
across
the
river
watching
the
shapleys
side
door
from
which
rose
might
issue
at
any
moment
and
at
this
point
in
the
discussion
he
had
lounged
away
from
the
group
and
moving
toward
the
bridge
began
to
throw
pebbles
idly
into
the
water

most
of
them
remembered
the
waterman
twins
stephen
cousins
now
both
dead
slow
waterman
so
moderate
in
his
steps
and
actions
that
you
had
to
fix
a
landmark
somewhere
near
him
to
see
if
he
moved
and
pretty
quick
who
shone
by
comparison
with
his
twin
i
kind
o
forgot
that
pretty
quick
waterman
was
cousin
to
steve
said
the
under
boss
he
never
worked
with
me
much
but
he
cut
off
the
same
piece
o
goods
as
the
other
watermans
great
hemlock
but
he
kep
a
cussin
dictionary
pretty
quick
did
whenever
he
heard
any
new
words
he
must
writ
down
an
then
studied
all
up
in

in
the
spring
drive

a
habit
that
hed
ought
to
be
practiced
with
turrible
caution
observed
old
wiley
when
the
drivers
had
finished
luncheon
and
taken
out
their
pipes
there
three
kinds
swearin
plain
swearin
profane
swearin
an
blasphemious
swearin
logs
air
jest
like
mules
there
times
when
a
man
ca
seem
to
rip
up
a
jam
in
good
style
a
few
words
that
too
strong
for
the
infant
classes
in
but
a
man
hed
ought
to
tempt
providence
when
he
ridin
a
log
near
the
falls
at
high
water
or
cuttin
the
in
a
jam
he
ai
in
no

come
you
an
i

was
the
only
ones
that
seen
pretty
quick
go
we
continued
old
kennebec
glancing
at
long
abe
dennett
cousin
to
short
abe
who
lay
on
his
back
in
the
grass
the
rising
from
his
pipe
and
the
steel
spikes
in
his
heavy
boots
shining
in
the
sun
there
was
folks
on
the
bridge
long
answered
but
we
was
the
only
ones
near
enough
to
see
an
hear
it
was
so
onexpected
an
so
soon
over
that
them
as
was
watchin
upstream
where
the
men
was
to
work
on
the
falls
would
hed
time
to
see
him
go
down
but
i
did
nobody
ai
heard
me
swear
sence
though
it
ten
years
ago
i
allers
said
it
was
rum
an
bravadder
that
killed
pretty
quick
waterman
that
day
the
boys
hed
give
him
a
that
he
hed
took
up
he
seemed
like
he
was
possessed
an
the
logs
was
the
same
way
they
was
fairly
wild
leapin
around
in
the
maddest
kind
o
water
you
ever
see
the
river
was
high
that
spring
it
was
an
awful
stubborn
jam
pretty
quick
he
workin
on
it
sence
dinner
he
clumb
up
the
bank
more
once
to
have
a
pull
at
the
bottle
that
was
hid
in
the
bushes
interpolated
wiley
like
as
not
that
was
his
failin
well
most
o
the
boys
were
on
the
other
side
o
the
river
workin
above
the
bridge
an
the
boss
hed
called
pretty
quick
to
come
off
an
leave
the
jam
till
mornin
when
they
get
horses
an
it
off
log
by
log
but
when
the
boss
got
out
o
sight
pretty
quick
jest
stood
right
still
swingin
his
axe
blasphemin
so
would
freeze
your
blood
vowin
he
would
move
till
the
logs
did
if
he
stayed
there
till
the
crack
o
doom
jest
then
a
great
ponderous
log
that
hed
churnin
up
an
down
in
the
falls
for
a
week
got
free
an
come
blunderin
an
thunderin
land
it
was
chockfull
o
water
an
looked
as
big
as
a
church
it
come
straight
along
foremost
an
struck
that
jam
full
force
every
log
in
it
shivered
there
was
a
crack
the
crack
o
doom
sure
enough
for
pretty
quick
an
one
o
the
logs
right
out
struck
him
jest
where
he
stood
with
his
axe
in
the
air
blasphemin
the
jam
kind
o
melted
an
crumbled
up
an
in
a
second
pretty
quick
was
whirlin
in
the
white
water
he
never
riz
at
least
where
we
could
see
him
an
we
did
find
him
for
a
week
that
the
whole
story
i
guess
steve
takes
it
as
a
warnin
any
way
he
ai
no
friend
to
rum
nor
swearin
steve
ai
he
knows
pretty
quick
ways
shortened
his
mother
life
an
you
notice
what
a
sharp
lookout
he
keeps
on
rufus
he
needs
it
ike
billings
commented
tersely
some
men
seem
to
lose
their
wits
when
they
workin
on
logs
observed
wiley
who
had
deeply
resented
long
dennett
telling
of
a
story
which
he
knew
fully
as
well
and
could
have
told
much
better
now
i
seen
things
on
the
kennebec
three
cheers
for
the
saco
hats
off
boys
shouted
jed
towle
and
his
directions
were
followed
with
a
will
as
i
was
sayin
continued
the
old
man
peacefully
i
seen
things
on
the
kennebec
that
would
happen
on
a
small
river
an
i
in
turrible
places
an
taken
turrible
resks
resks
that
would
turned
a
saco
river
man
hair
white
but
them
is
the
times
when
my
wits
work
the
quickest
i
remember
once
i
was
smokin
my
pipe
when
a
jam
broke
under
me
was
a
small
jam
or
what
we
call
a
small
jam
on
the
kennebec
only
about
three
hundred
thousand
pine
logs
the
first
thing
i
knowed
i
was
shootin
back
an
forth
in
the
foam
hangin
on
t
the
end
of
a
log
like
a
spider
my
hands
was
clasped
round
the
log
and
i
never
lost
control
o
my
pipe
they
said
i
smoked
right
along
jest
as
cool
an
placid
as
a
why
you
quit
drivin
inquired
ivory
my
strength
ekal
to
it
wiley
responded
sadly
i
was
all
skin
bones
an
nerve
the
would
part
with
me
altogether
so
they
give
me
a
place
in
the
office
down
on
the
wharves
that
so
bad
said
jed
towle
why
did
you
hang
on
to
it
so
to
keep
in
sight
o
the
kennebec
i
found
i
could
be
confined
under
cover
my
liver
give
all
out
my
appetite
failed
me
an
i
wuth
a
day
wages
i
learned
engineerin
when
i
was
a
boy
an
i
thought
i
try
runnin
on
the
road
a
spell
but
it
did
suit
my
constitution
my
kidneys
ai
turrible
strong
an
the
doctors
said
i
have
bright
disease
if
i
did
git
some
kind
o
work
where
there
no
vibrations
hard
to
find
wiley
hard
to
find
said
jed
towle
you
right
responded
the
old
man
feelingly
i
tried
all
kinds
o
labor
some
of
do
suit
my
liver
some
disagrees
with
my
stomach
and
the
rest
of
has
vibrations
so
here
i
set
high
dry
on
the
banks
of
life
you
might
say
like
a
stranded
log
as
this
simile
fell
upon
the
ear
there
was
a
general
stir
in
the
group
for
turrible
wiley
when
rhetorical
sometimes
grew
tearful
and
this
was
a
mood
not
to
be
encouraged
all
right
boss
called
ike
billings
winking
to
the
boys
we
be
there
in
a
jiffy
for
the
luncheon
hour
had
flown
and
the
work
of
the
afternoon
was
waiting
for
them
you
make
a
where
you
left
off
wiley
an
we
hear
the
rest
only
do
you
forgit
nothin
was
the
kennebec
you
was
talkin
about
i
will
indeed
responded
the
old
man
as
i
was
sayin
when
interrupted
i
may
be
a
stranded
log
but
i
proud
that
the
mark
o
the
lumber
is
on
me
when
i
git
to
my
journey
end
they
know
where
i
belong
and
send
me
back
to
the
kennebec
before
sawed
up
i
like
to
forgit
this
triflin
brook
in
the
sight
of
a
river
an
rest
my
eyes
on
some
logs
these
little
damn
pipestems
you
boys
are
playin
with
the
game
of
jackstraws
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
at
the
old
man
boast
but
in
a
moment
all
was
activity
the
men
ran
hither
and
thither
like
ants
gathering
their
tools
there
were
some
straight
heavy
levers
without
any
dog
and
there
were
modern
and
peaveys
for
every
river
has
its
favorite
equipment
in
these
things
there
was
no
dynamite
in
those
days
to
make
the
stubborn
jams
yield
and
the
was
in
general
use
horses
or
oxen
sometimes
a
line
of
men
stood
on
the
a
long
rope
was
attached
by
means
of
a
steel
spike
to
one
log
after
another
and
it
was
dragged
from
the
tangled
mass
sometimes
after
unloading
the
top
logs
those
at
the
bottom
would
rise
and
make
the
task
easier
sometimes
the
work
would
go
on
for
hours
with
no
perceptible
progress
and
wiley
would
have
opportunity
to
tell
the
bystanders
of
a
turrible
jam
on
the
kennebec
that
had
cost
the
lumber
company
ten
thousand
dollars
to
break
there
would
be
great
arguments
on
shore
among
the
villagers
as
well
as
among
the
experts
as
to
the
particular
log
which
might
be
a
key
to
the
position
the
boss
would
study
the
problem
from
various
standpoints
and
the
drivers
themselves
would
pass
from
heated
discussion
into
long
consultations
they
paid
by
the
day
old
kennebec
would
philosophize
to
the
doctor
an
when
they
consultin
they
do
hev
to
be
doggin
which
is
a
turrible
sight
harder
work
rose
had
created
a
small
sensation
on
one
occasion
by
pointing
out
to
the
under
boss
the
in
a
jam
she
was
past
mistress
of
the
pretty
game
of
jackstraws
much
in
vogue
at
that
time
the
delicate
little
lengths
of
polished
wood
or
bone
were
shaken
together
and
emptied
on
the
table
each
jackstraw
had
one
of
its
ends
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
some
sort
of
implement
a
rake
hoe
spade
fork
or
mallet
all
the
pieces
were
intertwined
by
the
shaking
process
and
they
lay
as
they
fell
in
a
hopeless
tangle
the
task
consisted
in
taking
a
tiny
scarcely
bigger
than
a
match
and
with
the
bit
of
curved
wire
on
the
end
lifting
off
the
jackstraws
one
by
one
without
stirring
the
pile
or
making
it
tremble
when
this
occurred
you
gave
place
to
your
opponent
who
relinquished
his
turn
to
you
when
ill
fortune
descended
upon
him
the
game
which
was
a
kind
of
and
in
miniature
being
decided
by
the
number
of
pieces
captured
and
their
value
no
wonder
that
the
under
boss
asked
rose
advice
as
to
the
she
had
a
fairy
hand
and
her
cunning
at
deciding
the
pieces
to
be
moved
and
her
skill
at
extricating
and
lifting
them
from
the
heap
were
looked
upon
in
edgewood
as
little
less
than
supernatural
it
was
a
favorite
pastime
and
although
a
man
hand
is
ill
adapted
to
it
being
and
heavy
the
game
has
obvious
advantages
for
a
lover
in
bringing
his
head
very
close
to
that
of
his
beloved
adversary
the
jackstraws
have
to
be
watched
with
a
hawk
eagerness
since
the
trembling
can
be
discerned
only
by
a
keen
eye
but
there
were
moments
when
stephen
was
willing
to
risk
the
loss
of
a
battle
if
he
could
watch
rose
drooping
eyelashes
the
delicate
down
on
her
pink
cheek
and
the
feathery
curls
that
broke
away
from
her
hair
he
was
looking
at
her
now
from
a
distance
for
she
and
mite
shapley
were
assisting
jed
towle
to
pile
up
the
tin
plates
and
tie
the
tin
dippers
together
next
she
peered
into
one
of
the
and
seemed
pleased
that
there
was
still
something
in
its
depths
then
she
gathered
the
fragments
neatly
together
in
a
basket
and
followed
by
her
friend
clambered
down
the
banks
to
a
shady
spot
where
the
boomshers
otherwise
known
as
the
crambry
family
were
lined
up
expectantly
it
is
not
difficult
to
find
a
single
fool
in
any
community
however
small
but
a
family
of
fools
is
fortunately
somewhat
rarer
every
county
however
can
boast
of
one
and
york
county
is
always
in
the
fashion
with
fools
as
with
everything
else
the
unique
and
undesirable
boomshers
could
not
be
claimed
as
indigenous
to
the
saco
valley
for
this
branch
was
an
offshoot
of
a
still
larger
tribe
inhabiting
a
distant
township
its
beginnings
were
shrouded
in
mystery
there
was
a
ancestor
somewhere
and
a
gipsy
or
indian
grandmother
they
had
always
intermarried
from
time
immemorial
when
one
of
the
selectmen
of
their
native
place
had
been
asked
why
the
boomshers
always
married
cousins
and
why
the
habit
was
not
discouraged
he
replied
that
he
really
did
know
he
they
felt
it
would
be
kind
of
odd
to
go
right
out
and
marry
a
stranger
lest
boomsher
seem
an
unusual
surname
it
must
be
explained
that
the
actual
name
was
french
and
could
not
be
coped
with
by
edgewood
or
pleasant
river
being
something
quite
as
impossible
to
spell
as
to
pronounce
as
the
family
had
lived
for
the
last
few
years
somewhere
near
the
killick
cranberry
meadows
they
were
called
and
completely
described
in
the
calling
the
crambry
a
talented
and
much
traveled
gentleman
who
once
stayed
over
night
at
the
edgewood
tavern
proclaimed
it
his
opinion
that
boomsher
had
been
gradually
corrupted
from
beaumarchais
when
he
wrote
the
word
on
his
visiting
card
and
showed
it
to
wiley
old
kennebec
had
replied
that
in
the
judgment
of
a
man
who
had
lived
in
large
places
and
seen
a
turrible
lot
o
life
such
a
name
could
never
have
been
given
either
to
a
christian
or
a
heathen
family
that
the
way
in
which
the
letters
was
thrown
together
into
it
and
the
way
in
which
they
was
sounded
when
read
out
loud
was
entirely
reason
it
was
true
he
said
that
beaumarchais
such
a
fool
name
might
invented
for
a
fool
family
but
he
would
hold
even
with
callin
boomsher
crambry
was
well
enough
an
a
sight
easier
to
speak
stephen
knew
a
good
deal
about
the
crambrys
for
he
passed
their
habitation
in
going
to
one
of
his
it
was
only
a
month
before
that
he
had
found
them
all
sitting
outside
their
fence
surrounded
by
decrepit
chairs
sofas
tables
bedsteads
bits
of
carpet
and
stoves
what
the
matter
he
called
out
from
his
wagon
there
ai
the
matter
said
alcestis
crambry
father
dead
an
we
dividin
up
the
furnerchure
alcestis
was
the
pride
of
the
crambrys
and
the
list
of
his
attainments
used
often
to
be
on
his
proud
father
lips
it
was
he
who
was
the
largest
for
his
size
in
the
family
he
who
could
tell
his
brothers
paul
and
arcadus
by
their
looks
he
who
knew
a
sour
apple
from
a
sweet
one
the
minute
he
bit
it
he
who
at
the
early
age
of
ten
was
bright
enough
to
point
to
the
cupboard
and
say
puddin
dad
alcestis
had
enjoyed
in
consequence
of
his
unusual
intellectual
powers
some
educational
privileges
and
the
killick
schoolmistress
well
remembered
his
first
day
at
the
village
seat
of
learning
reports
of
what
took
place
in
this
classic
temple
from
day
to
day
may
have
been
wafted
to
the
dull
ears
of
the
boy
who
was
not
thought
ready
for
school
until
he
had
attained
the
ripe
age
of
twelve
it
may
even
have
been
that
specific
rumors
of
the
signs
symbols
and
hieroglyphics
used
in
educational
institutions
had
reached
him
in
the
obscurity
of
his
cranberry
meadows
at
all
events
when
confronted
by
the
alphabet
chart
whose
huge
black
capitals
were
intended
to
capture
the
wandering
eyes
of
the
infant
class
alcestis
exhibited
unusual
almost
unnatural
excitement
that
is
my
boy
said
the
teacher
genially
as
she
pointed
to
the
first
character
on
the
chart
good
god
is
that
exclaimed
alcestis
sitting
down
heavily
on
the
nearest
bench
and
neither
teacher
nor
scholars
could
discover
whether
he
was
agreeably
surprised
or
disappointed
in
the
letter
whether
he
had
expected
if
he
ever
encountered
it
to
find
it
writhing
in
coils
on
the
floor
of
a
cage
or
whether
it
simply
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
ideal
already
established
in
his
mind
wiley
had
once
tried
to
make
something
of
mercy
the
oldest
daughter
of
the
family
but
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
she
announced
that
a
girl
who
could
tell
whether
the
clock
was
going
forrards
or
backwards
and
who
rubbed
a
pocket
handkerchief
as
long
as
she
did
a
sheet
would
be
no
help
in
her
household
the
crambrys
had
daily
walked
the
five
or
six
miles
from
their
home
to
the
edgewood
bridge
during
the
progress
of
the
drive
not
only
for
the
social
and
intellectual
advantages
to
be
gained
from
the
company
present
but
for
the
more
solid
compensation
of
a
good
meal
they
all
adored
rose
partly
because
she
gave
them
food
and
partly
because
she
was
sparkling
and
pretty
and
wore
pink
dresses
that
caught
their
dull
eyes
the
afternoon
proved
a
lively
one
in
the
first
place
one
of
the
younger
men
slipped
into
the
water
between
two
logs
part
of
a
lot
chained
together
waiting
to
be
let
out
of
the
boom
the
weight
of
the
mass
higher
up
and
the
force
of
the
current
wedged
him
in
rather
tightly
and
when
he
had
been
pried
out
he
declared
that
he
felt
like
an
apple
after
it
had
been
squeezed
in
the
so
he
drove
home
and
rufus
waterman
took
his
place
two
hours
hard
work
followed
this
incident
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
bung
that
reached
from
the
shore
to
waterman
ledge
the
rock
where
pretty
quick
met
his
fate
was
broken
up
and
the
logs
that
composed
it
were
started
down
river
there
remained
now
only
the
great
at
gray
rock
this
had
been
allowed
to
grow
gathering
logs
as
they
drifted
past
thus
making
higher
water
and
a
stronger
current
on
the
other
side
of
the
rock
and
allowing
an
easier
passage
for
the
logs
at
that
point
all
was
excitement
now
for
this
particular
piece
of
work
accomplished
the
boom
above
the
falls
would
be
turned
out
and
the
river
would
once
more
be
clear
and
clean
at
the
edgewood
bridge
small
boys
perching
on
the
rocks
with
their
heels
hanging
hands
and
mouths
full
of
red
astrakhan
apples
cheered
their
favorites
to
the
echo
while
the
drivers
shouted
to
one
another
and
watched
the
signs
and
signals
of
the
boss
who
could
communicate
with
them
only
in
that
way
so
great
was
the
roar
of
the
water
the
jam
refused
to
yield
to
ordinary
measures
it
was
a
difficult
problem
for
the
rocky
held
many
a
snare
and
pitfall
there
was
a
certain
ledge
under
the
water
so
artfully
placed
that
every
log
striking
under
its
projecting
edges
would
wedge
itself
firmly
there
attracting
others
by
its
evil
example
that
ought
to
hev
shoved
his
crew
down
to
that
jam
this
mornin
grumbled
old
kennebec
to
alcestis
crambry
who
was
always
his
most
loyal
and
attentive
listener
but
he
would
take
no
advice
not
if
pharaoh
nor
boat
nor
herod
nor
nicodemus
come
right
out
o
the
bible
an
give
it
to
him
the
logs
air
contrary
sometimes
they
go
along
as
easy
as
an
old
shoe
an
other
times
they
do
nothin
but
bung
bung
bung
there
a
log
nestlin
down
in
the
middle
o
that
jam
that
i
watchin
for
a
week
it
a
one
to
begin
with
an
then
it
has
a
mark
on
it
that
you
can
it
by
did
ye
ever
hear
tell
o
george
the
third
king
of
england
alcestis
or
ai
he
known
over
to
the
crambry
medders
well
once
upon
a
time
men
used
to
go
through
the
forests
over
here
an
slash
a
mark
on
the
trunks
o
the
biggest
trees
that
was
the
royal
sign
as
you
might
say
an
meant
that
the
tree
was
to
be
taken
over
to
england
to
make
masts
an
for
the
king
ships
what
made
me
think
of
it
now
is
that
the
king
mark
was
an
arrer
an
it
an
arrer
that
on
that
there
log
i

pesky
crooked
contrary

time

while
i
go
back
a
piece
an
git
the
pipe
out
o
my
coat
pocket
i
guess
nothin
goin
to
happen
for
a
few
minutes
the
surmise
about
the
horses
unlike
most
of
old
kennebec
proved
to
be
true
benson
pair
had
gone
to
portland
with
a
load
of
hay
accordingly
the
tackle
was
brought
the
rope
was
adjusted
to
a
log
and
five
of
the
drivers
standing
on
the
attempted
to
drag
it
from
its
intrenched
position
it
refused
to
yield
the
fraction
of
an
inch
rufus
and
stephen
joined
the
five
men
and
the
augmented
crew
of
seven
were
putting
all
their
strength
on
the
rope
when
a
cry
went
up
from
the
watchers
on
the
bridge
the
dog
had
loosened
suddenly
and
the
men
were
flung
violently
to
the
ground
for
a
second
they
were
stunned
both
by
the
surprise
and
by
the
shock
of
the
blow
but
in
the
same
moment
the
cry
of
the
crowd
swelled
louder
alcestis
crambry
had
stolen
all
unnoticed
to
the
rope
and
had
attempted
to
use
his
feeble
powers
for
the
common
good
when
then
blow
came
he
fell
backward
and
making
no
effort
to
control
the
situation
slid
over
the
bank
and
into
the
water
illustration
in
a
twinkling
he
was
in
the
water
the
other
crambrys
not
realizing
the
danger
laughed
audibly
but
there
was
no
jeering
from
the
bridge
stephen
had
seen
alcestis
slip
and
in
the
fraction
of
a
moment
had
taken
off
his
boots
and
was
coasting
down
the
slippery
rocks
behind
him
in
a
twinkling
he
was
in
the
water
almost
as
soon
as
the
boy
himself
doggoned
idjut
exclaimed
old
kennebec
tearfully
wuth
the
hull
fool
family
if
i
hed
so
old
i
jumped
in
myself
for
you
ca
drownd
a
wiley
not
without
you
tie
to
their
head
feet
an
drop
in
the
falls
alcestis
who
had
neither
brains
courage
nor
experience
had
better
still
the
luck
that
follows
the
witless
he
was
carried
swiftly
down
the
current
but
only
fifty
feet
away
a
long
slender
log
wedged
between
two
low
rocks
on
the
shore
jutted
out
over
the
water
almost
touching
its
surface
the
boy
clothes
were
admirably
adapted
to
the
situation
being
full
of
enormous
rents
in
some
way
the
end
of
the
log
caught
in
the
rags
of
alcestis
coat
and
held
him
just
seconds
enough
to
enable
stephen
to
swim
to
him
to
seize
him
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
to
lift
him
on
the
log
and
thence
to
the
shore
it
was
a
particularly
bad
place
for
a
landing
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
lower
ropes
and
drag
the
drenched
men
to
the
high
ground
above
alcestis
came
to
his
senses
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
and
seemed
as
bright
as
usual
with
a
kind
of
added
swagger
at
being
the
central
figure
in
a
dramatic
situation
i
wonder
you
hed
stove
your
brains
out
when
you
landed
so
turrible
suddent
on
that
rock
at
the
foot
of
the
bank
said
wiley
to
him
i
should
but
i
took
good
care
to
light
on
my
head
responded
alcestis
a
cryptic
remark
which
so
puzzled
old
kennebec
that
he
mused
over
it
for
some
hours
hearts
and
other
hearts
stephen
had
brought
a
change
of
clothes
as
he
had
a
habit
of
being
ducked
once
at
least
during
the
day
and
since
there
was
a
halt
in
the
proceedings
and
no
need
of
his
services
for
an
hour
or
two
he
found
rose
and
walked
with
her
to
a
secluded
spot
where
they
could
watch
the
logs
and
not
be
seen
by
the
people
you
frightened
everybody
almost
to
death
jumping
into
the
river
chided
rose
stephen
laughed
they
thought
i
was
a
fool
to
save
a
fool
i
suppose
perhaps
not
as
bad
as
that
but
it
did
seem
reckless
i
know
and
the
boy
no
doubt
would
be
better
off
dead
but
so
should
i
be
if
i
could
have
let
him
die
rose
regarded
this
strange
point
of
view
for
a
moment
and
then
silently
acquiesced
in
it
she
was
constantly
doing
this
and
she
often
felt
that
her
mental
horizon
broadened
in
the
act
but
she
could
not
be
sure
that
stephen
grew
any
dearer
to
her
because
of
his
moral
altitudes
besides
stephen
argued
i
happened
to
be
nearest
to
the
river
and
it
was
my
job
how
do
you
always
happen
to
be
nearest
to
the
people
in
trouble
and
why
is
it
always
your
if
there
are
any
rewards
for
good
conduct
being
distributed
i
right
in
line
with
my
hand
stretched
out
stephen
replied
with
meaning
in
his
voice
rose
blushed
under
her
flowery
hat
as
he
led
the
way
to
a
bench
under
a
sycamore
tree
that
overhung
the
water
she
had
almost
convinced
herself
that
she
was
as
much
in
love
with
stephen
waterman
as
it
was
in
her
nature
to
be
with
anybody
he
was
handsome
in
his
big
way
kind
generous
temperate
well
educated
and
no
fault
could
be
found
with
his
family
for
his
mother
had
been
a
teacher
and
his
father
though
a
farmer
a
college
graduate
stephen
himself
had
had
one
year
at
bowdoin
but
had
been
recalled
as
the
head
of
the
house
when
his
father
died
that
was
a
severe
blow
but
his
mother
death
three
years
after
was
a
grief
never
to
be
quite
forgotten
rose
too
was
the
child
of
a
gently
bred
mother
and
all
her
instincts
were
refined
yes
stephen
in
himself
satisfied
her
in
all
the
larger
wants
of
her
nature
but
she
had
an
unsatisfied
hunger
for
the
world
the
world
of
portland
where
her
cousins
lived
or
better
still
the
world
of
boston
of
which
she
heard
through
mrs
wealthy
brooks
whose
nephew
claude
often
came
to
visit
her
in
edgewood
life
on
a
farm
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
from
and
stores
life
in
the
house
with
rufus
who
was
rumored
to
be
somewhat
wild
and
unsteady
this
prospect
seemed
a
trifle
dull
and
uneventful
to
the
trivial
part
of
her
though
to
the
better
part
it
was
enough
the
better
part
of
her
loved
stephen
waterman
dimly
feeling
the
richness
of
his
nature
the
tenderness
of
his
affection
the
strength
of
his
character
rose
was
not
destitute
either
of
imagination
or
sentiment
she
did
not
relish
this
constant
weighing
of
stephen
in
the
balance
he
was
too
good
to
be
weighed
and
considered
she
longed
to
be
carried
out
of
herself
on
a
wave
of
rapturous
assent
but
something
seemed
to
hold
her
back
some
seed
of
discontent
with
the
man
environment
and
circumstances
some
germ
of
longing
for
a
gayer
brighter
more
varied
life
no
amount
of
or
argument
could
change
the
situation
she
always
loved
stephen
more
or
less
more
when
he
was
away
from
her
because
she
never
approved
his
collars
nor
the
set
of
his
shirt
bosom
and
as
he
naturally
wore
these
despised
articles
of
apparel
whenever
he
proposed
to
her
she
was
always
lukewarm
about
marrying
him
and
settling
down
on
the
river
farm
still
she
discovered
in
herself
with
positive
gratitude
a
warmer
feeling
for
him
than
she
had
experienced
before
he
wore
a
new
and
becoming
gray
flannel
shirt
with
the
soft
turnover
collar
that
belonged
to
it
and
a
blue
tie
the
color
of
his
kind
eyes
she
knew
that
he
had
shaved
his
beard
at
her
request
not
long
ago
and
that
when
she
did
not
like
the
effect
as
much
as
she
had
hoped
he
had
meekly
grown
a
mustache
for
her
sake
it
did
seem
as
if
a
man
could
hardly
do
more
to
please
an
exacting
and
she
had
admired
him
unreservedly
when
he
pulled
off
his
boots
and
jumped
into
the
river
to
save
alcestis
crambry
life
without
giving
a
single
thought
to
his
own
and
was
there
ever
after
all
such
a
noble
devoted
unselfish
fellow
or
a
better
brother
and
would
she
not
despise
herself
for
rejecting
him
simply
because
he
was
countrified
and
because
she
longed
to
see
the
world
of
the
in
the
magazines
the
logs
are
so
like
people
she
exclaimed
as
they
sat
down
i
could
name
nearly
every
one
of
them
for
somebody
in
the
village
look
at
mite
shapley
that
dancing
little
one
slipping
over
the
falls
and
skimming
along
the
top
of
the
water
keeping
out
of
all
the
deep
places
and
never
once
touching
the
rocks
stephen
fell
into
her
mood
there
squire
anderson
coming
down
crosswise
and
bumping
everything
in
reach
you
know
he
always
buying
lumber
and
logs
without
knowing
what
he
is
going
to
do
with
them
they
just
lie
and
rot
by
the
roadside
the
boys
always
say
that
a
is
the
old
squire
on
a
log
and
that
stout
clumsy
one
is
short
what
are
you
doing
stephen
only
building
a
fence
round
this
clump
of
harebells
stephen
replied
they
just
got
well
rooted
and
if
the
boys
come
skidding
down
the
bank
with
their
spiked
shoes
the
poor
things
will
never
hold
up
their
heads
again
now
they
oh
look
rose
there
come
the
minister
and
his
wife
a
portly
couple
of
peeled
logs
exactly
matched
in
size
came
ponderously
over
the
falls
together
rose
within
a
second
of
each
other
joined
again
and
swept
under
the
bridge
side
by
side
and
oh
oh
and
cram
just
after
them
is
that
funny
laughed
rose
as
a
very
long
slender
pair
of
pines
swam
down
as
close
to
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
glued
in
that
position
rose
thought
as
she
watched
them
who
but
stephen
would
have
cared
what
became
of
the
clump
of
delicate
harebells
how
gentle
such
a
man
would
be
to
a
woman
how
tender
his
touch
would
be
if
she
were
ill
or
in
trouble
several
single
logs
followed
crooked
ones
stolid
ones
adventurous
ones
feeble
swimmers
deep
divers
some
of
them
tried
to
start
a
small
jam
on
their
own
account
others
stranded
themselves
for
good
and
all
as
rose
and
stephen
sat
there
side
by
side
with
little
dan
cupid
for
an
invisible
third
on
the
bench
there
never
was
anything
so
like
people
rose
repeated
leaning
forward
excitedly
and
upon
my
word
the
minister
and
doctor
couples
are
still
together
i
wonder
if
they
get
as
far
as
the
falls
at
union
that
would
be
an
odd
place
to
part
would
it
union
stephen
saw
his
opportunity
and
seized
it
there
a
reason
rose
why
two
logs
go
down
stream
better
than
one
and
get
into
less
trouble
they
make
a
wider
path
create
more
force
and
a
better
current
it
the
same
way
with
men
and
women
oh
rose
there
is
a
man
in
the
world
that
loved
you
as
long
or
knows
how
to
love
you
any
better
than
i
do
you
just
like
a
white
birch
sapling
and
i
a
great
clumsy
fir
tree
but
if
you
only
trust
yourself
to
me
rose
i
take
you
safely
down
river
stephen
big
hand
closed
on
rose
little
one
she
returned
its
pressure
softly
and
gave
him
the
kiss
that
with
her
as
with
him
meant
a
promise
for
all
the
years
to
come
the
truth
and
passion
in
the
man
had
broken
the
girl
bonds
for
the
moment
her
vision
was
clearer
and
realizing
the
treasures
of
love
and
fidelity
that
were
being
offered
her
she
accepted
them
half
unconscious
that
she
was
not
returning
them
in
kind
how
is
the
belle
of
two
villages
to
learn
that
she
should
thank
heaven
fasting
for
a
good
man
love
and
stephen
he
went
home
in
the
dusk
not
knowing
whether
his
feet
were
touching
the
solid
earth
or
whether
he
was
treading
upon
rainbows
rose
pink
calico
seemed
to
brush
him
as
he
walked
in
the
path
that
was
wide
enough
only
for
one
his
solitude
was
peopled
again
when
he
fed
the
cattle
for
rose
face
smiled
at
him
from
the
haymow
and
when
he
strained
the
milk
rose
held
the
pans
his
nightly
tasks
over
he
went
out
and
took
his
favorite
seat
under
the
apple
tree
all
was
still
save
for
the
crickets
ceaseless
chirp
the
soft
thud
of
an
august
sweeting
dropping
in
the
grass
and
the
of
the
water
against
his
boat
tethered
in
the
willow
cove
he
remembered
when
he
first
saw
rose
for
that
must
have
been
when
he
began
to
love
her
though
he
was
only
fourteen
and
quite
unconscious
that
the
first
seed
had
been
dropped
in
the
rich
soil
of
his
boyish
heart
illustration
rose
i
take
you
safely
he
was
seated
on
the
kerosene
barrel
in
the
edgewood
which
was
also
the
general
country
store
where
newspapers
letters
molasses
nails
salt
codfish
hairpins
sugar
liver
pills
canned
goods
beans
and
ginghams
dwelt
in
genial
proximity
when
she
entered
just
a
little
slip
of
a
thing
with
a
tin
pail
in
her
hand
and
a
sunbonnet
falling
off
her
wavy
hair
stephen
suddenly
stopped
swinging
his
feet
she
gravely
announced
her
wants
reading
them
from
a
bit
of
paper
quart
molasses
package
ginger
lb
cheese
pairs
shoe
laces
card
shirt
buttons
while
the
storekeeper
drew
off
the
molasses
she
exchanged
shy
looks
with
stephen
who
clean
and
carefully
mothered
as
he
was
felt
all
at
once
uncouth
and
awkward
rather
as
if
he
were
some
clumsy
lout
pitchforked
into
the
presence
of
a
fairy
queen
he
offered
her
the
little
bunch
of
bachelor
buttons
he
held
in
his
hand
augury
of
the
future
had
he
known
it
and
she
accepted
them
with
a
smile
she
dropped
her
memorandum
he
picked
it
up
and
she
smiled
again
doing
still
more
fatal
damage
than
in
the
first
instance
no
words
were
spoken
but
rose
even
at
ten
had
less
need
of
them
than
most
of
her
sex
for
her
dimples
aided
by
dancing
eyes
length
of
lashes
and
curve
of
lips
quite
took
the
place
of
conversation
the
dimples
tempted
assented
denied
corroborated
deplored
protested
sympathized
while
the
intoxicated
beholder
cudgeled
his
brain
for
words
or
deeds
which
should
provoke
and
evoke
more
and
more
dimples
the
storekeeper
hung
the
molasses
pail
over
rose
right
arm
and
tucked
the
packages
under
her
left
and
as
he
opened
the
mosquito
netting
door
to
let
her
pass
out
she
looked
back
at
stephen
perched
on
the
kerosene
barrel
just
a
little
girl
a
little
glance
a
little
dimple
and
stephen
was
never
quite
the
same
again
the
years
went
on
and
the
boy
became
man
yet
no
other
image
had
ever
troubled
the
deep
placid
waters
of
his
heart
now
after
many
denials
the
hopes
and
longings
of
his
nature
had
been
answered
and
rose
had
promised
to
marry
him
he
would
sacrifice
his
passion
for
logging
and
driving
in
the
future
and
become
a
staid
farmer
and
man
of
affairs
only
giving
himself
a
river
holiday
now
and
then
how
still
and
peaceful
it
was
under
the
trees
and
how
glad
his
mother
would
be
to
think
that
the
old
farm
would
wake
from
its
sleep
and
a
woman
light
foot
be
heard
in
the
sunny
kitchen
heaven
was
full
of
silent
stars
and
there
was
a
moonglade
on
the
water
that
stretched
almost
from
him
to
rose
his
heart
embarked
on
that
golden
pathway
and
sailed
on
it
to
the
farther
shore
the
river
was
free
of
logs
and
under
the
light
of
the
moon
it
shone
like
a
silver
mirror
the
soft
wind
among
the
fir
branches
breathed
rose
name
the
river
rippling
against
the
shore
sang
rose
and
as
stephen
sat
there
dreaming
of
the
future
his
dreams
too
could
have
been
voiced
in
one
word
and
that
word
rose
the
little
house
the
autumn
days
flew
past
like
shuttles
in
a
loom
the
river
reflected
the
yellow
foliage
of
the
white
birch
and
the
scarlet
of
the
maples
the
wayside
was
bright
with
goldenrod
with
the
red
tassels
of
the
sumac
with
the
purple
and
feathery
clematis
if
rose
was
not
as
happy
as
stephen
she
was
quietly
content
and
felt
that
she
had
more
to
be
grateful
for
than
most
girls
for
stephen
surprised
her
with
first
one
evidence
and
then
another
of
thoughtful
generosity
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
felt
that
rose
was
not
wholly
his
that
she
reserved
withheld
something
and
it
was
the
subjugation
of
this
rebellious
province
that
he
sought
he
and
rose
had
agreed
to
wait
a
year
for
their
marriage
in
which
time
rose
cousin
would
finish
school
and
be
ready
to
live
with
the
old
people
meanwhile
stephen
had
learned
that
his
maiden
aunt
would
be
glad
to
come
and
keep
house
for
rufus
the
work
at
the
river
farm
was
too
hard
for
a
girl
so
he
had
persuaded
himself
of
late
and
the
house
was
so
far
from
the
village
that
rose
was
sure
to
be
lonely
he
owned
a
couple
of
acres
between
his
place
and
the
edgewood
bridge
and
here
one
afternoon
only
a
month
after
their
engagement
he
took
rose
to
see
the
foundations
of
a
little
house
he
was
building
for
her
it
was
to
be
only
a
cottage
of
six
small
rooms
the
two
upper
chambers
to
be
finished
off
later
on
stephen
had
placed
it
well
back
from
the
road
leaving
space
in
front
for
what
was
to
be
a
most
wonderful
arrangement
of
yet
keeping
a
strip
at
the
back
on
the
for
a
small
vegetable
garden
there
had
been
a
house
there
years
before
so
many
years
that
the
blackened
ruins
were
entirely
overgrown
but
a
few
elms
and
an
old
remained
to
shade
the
new
dwelling
and
give
welcome
to
the
coming
inmates
stephen
had
fifteen
hundred
dollars
in
bank
he
could
turn
his
hand
to
almost
anything
and
his
love
was
so
deep
that
rose
had
never
sounded
bottom
accordingly
he
was
able
with
the
help
of
two
steady
workers
to
have
the
roof
on
before
the
first
of
november
the
weather
was
clear
and
fine
and
by
thanksgiving
clapboards
shingles
two
coats
of
brown
paint
and
even
the
blinds
had
all
been
added
this
exhibition
of
reckless
energy
on
stephen
part
did
not
wholly
commend
itself
to
the
neighborhood
steve
too
turrible
spry
said
rose
grandfather
he
trip
himself
up
some
o
these
times

man
that

the
world
an
lived
in
large
places
an
the

i
was
ketchin
with
so
i
pitched
back
in
the
water
an
quit
during
the
progress
of
these
remarks
wiley
opened
the
door
under
the
sink
and
from
beneath
a
huge
iron
pot
drew
a
round
tray
loaded
with
a
glass
pitcher
and
half
a
dozen
tumblers
which
he
placed
carefully
on
the
kitchen
table
this
is
the
last
day
option
i
got
on
this
he
said
an
if
i
biddeford
i
got
to
make
up
my
mind
here
an
now
with
this
observation
he
took
off
his
shoes
climbed
in
his
stocking
feet
to
the
vantage
ground
of
a
kitchen
chair
and
lifted
a
stone
china
pitcher
from
a
corner
of
the
highest
cupboard
shelf
where
it
had
been
hidden
this
lemonade
gittin
kind
o
dusty
he
complained
i
to
hev
a
kind
of
a
spree
on
it
when
i
got
through
choosin
rose
present
but
i
guess
the
pig
he
v
to
help
me
out
the
old
man
filled
one
of
the
glasses
from
the
pitcher
pulled
up
the
kitchen
shades
to
the
top
put
both
hands
in
his
pockets
and
walked
solemnly
round
the
table
gazing
at
his
offering
from
every
possible
point
of
view
there
had
been
three
lemonade
sets
in
the
window
of
a
biddeford
crockery
store
when
wiley
chanced
to
pass
by
and
he
had
brought
home
the
blue
and
green
one
on
approval
to
the
casual
eye
it
would
have
appeared
as
quite
uniquely
hideous
until
the
red
and
yellow
or
the
purple
and
orange
ones
had
been
seen
after
that
no
human
being
could
have
made
a
decision
where
each
was
so
unparalleled
in
its
ugliness
and
old
kennebec
confusion
of
mind
would
have
been
perfectly
understood
by
the
connoisseur
how
do
you
like
it
with
the
lemonade
in
mother
he
inquired
eagerly
the
thing
that
plagues
me
most
is
that
the
red

yaller

week
lights
up
this
an
i
believe
i
settle
on
that
for
as
i
was
thinkin
last
night
in
bed
lemonade
is
mostly
an
evenin
drink
an
rose
wo
be
usin
the
set
much
by
daylight
root

looks
the
in
this
purple
set
but
rose
loves
lemonade
beer
so
i
guess
i
pack
up
this
one
an
change
it
mebbe
when
i
get
it
out
o
sight
an
give
the
lemonade
to
the
pig
be
easier
in
my
mind
in
the
opinion
of
the
community
at
large
stephen
forehandedness
in
the
matter
of
preparations
for
his
marriage
was
imprudence
and
his
desire
for
neatness
and
beauty
flagrant
extravagance
the
house
itself
was
a
foolish
idea
it
was
thought
but
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
for
the
maiden
aunt
really
needed
a
home
and
rufus
was
likely
to
marry
before
long
and
take
his
wife
to
the
river
farm
it
was
to
be
hoped
in
his
case
that
he
would
avoid
the
snares
of
beauty
and
choose
a
good
stout
girl
who
would
bring
the
dairy
back
to
what
it
was
in
waterman
time
all
winter
long
stephen
labored
on
the
inside
of
the
cottage
mostly
by
himself
he
learned
all
trades
in
succession
love
being
his
only
master
he
had
many
odd
days
to
spare
from
his
farm
work
and
if
he
had
not
found
days
he
would
have
taken
nights
scarcely
a
nail
was
driven
without
rose
advice
and
when
the
plastering
was
hard
and
dry
the
were
the
result
of
weeks
of
consultation
among
the
quiet
joys
of
life
there
is
probably
no
other
so
deep
so
sweet
so
full
of
trembling
hope
and
delight
as
the
building
and
making
of
a
home
a
home
where
two
lives
are
to
be
merged
in
one
and
flow
on
together
a
home
full
of
mysterious
and
delicious
possibilities
hidden
in
a
future
which
is
always
rose
sweet
little
nature
broadened
under
stephen
influence
but
she
had
her
moments
of
discontent
and
unrest
always
followed
quickly
by
remorse
at
the
thanksgiving
sociable
some
one
had
observed
her
turquoise
engagement
ring
some
one
who
said
that
such
a
hand
was
worthy
of
a
diamond
that
turquoises
were
a
pretty
color
but
that
there
was
only
one
stone
for
an
engagement
ring
and
that
was
a
diamond
at
the
christmas
dance
the
same
some
one
had
said
her
waltzing
would
make
her
all
the
rage
in
boston
she
wondered
if
it
were
true
and
wondered
whether
if
she
had
not
promised
to
marry
stephen
some
splendid
being
from
a
city
would
have
descended
from
his
heights
bearing
diamonds
in
his
hand
not
that
she
would
have
accepted
them
she
only
wondered
these
disloyal
thoughts
came
seldom
and
she
put
them
resolutely
away
devoting
herself
with
all
the
greater
assiduity
to
her
muslin
curtains
and
ruffled
stephen
too
had
his
momentary
pangs
there
were
times
when
he
could
calm
his
doubts
only
by
working
on
the
little
house
the
mere
sight
of
the
beloved
floors
and
walls
and
ceilings
comforted
his
heart
and
brought
him
good
cheer
the
winter
was
a
cold
one
so
bitterly
cold
that
even
the
rapid
water
at
the
gray
rock
was
a
mass
of
curdled
yellow
ice
something
that
had
only
occurred
once
or
twice
before
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
it
was
also
a
very
gay
season
for
pleasant
river
and
edgewood
never
had
there
been
so
many
sleigh
rides
and
tavern
dances
and
never
such
wonderful
skating
the
river
was
one
gleaming
glittering
thoroughfare
of
ice
from
milliken
mills
to
the
dam
at
the
edgewood
bridge
at
sundown
bonfires
were
built
here
and
there
on
the
mirror
like
surface
and
all
the
young
people
from
the
neighboring
villages
gathered
on
the
ice
while
detachments
of
merry
boys
and
girls
those
who
preferred
coasting
met
at
the
top
of
brigadier
hill
from
which
one
could
get
a
longer
and
more
perilous
slide
than
from
any
other
point
in
the
township
claude
merrill
in
his
occasional
visits
from
boston
was
very
much
in
evidence
at
the
saturday
evening
ice
parties
he
was
not
an
artist
at
the
sport
himself
but
he
was
especially
proficient
in
the
art
of
strapping
on
a
lady
skates
and
murmuring
as
he
adjusted
the
last
buckle
the
prettiest
foot
and
ankle
on
the
river
it
can
not
be
denied
that
this
compliment
gave
secret
pleasure
to
the
fair
village
maidens
who
received
it
but
it
was
a
pleasure
accompanied
by
electric
shocks
of
excitement
a
girl
foot
might
perhaps
be
mentioned
if
a
fellow
were
daring
enough
but
the
line
was
rigidly
drawn
at
the
ankle
which
was
not
a
part
of
the
human
frame
ever
alluded
to
in
the
polite
society
of
edgewood
at
that
time
rose
in
her
red
dress
and
her
squirrel
furs
and
cap
was
the
life
of
every
gathering
and
when
stephen
took
her
hand
and
they
glided
up
stream
alone
together
in
the
crowd
he
used
to
wish
that
they
might
skate
on
and
on
up
the
crystal
of
the
river
to
the
moon
itself
whither
it
seemed
to
lead
them
the
garden
of
eden
but
the
saco
all
this
time
was
meditating
of
its
surprises
the
snapping
cold
weather
and
the
depth
to
which
the
water
was
frozen
were
aiding
it
in
its
preparation
for
the
greatest
event
of
the
season
on
a
certain
gray
saturday
in
march
after
a
week
of
mild
temperature
it
began
to
rain
as
if
after
months
of
snowing
it
really
enjoyed
a
new
form
of
entertainment
sunday
dawned
with
the
very
of
heaven
opening
so
it
seemed
all
day
long
the
river
was
rising
under
its
miles
of
unbroken
ice
rising
at
the
threatening
rate
of
four
inches
an
hour
edgewood
went
to
bed
as
usual
that
night
for
the
bridge
at
that
point
was
set
too
high
to
be
carried
away
by
freshets
but
at
other
villages
whose
bridges
were
in
less
secure
position
there
was
little
sleep
and
much
anxiety
at
midnight
a
cry
was
heard
from
the
men
watching
at
milliken
mills
the
great
ice
jam
had
parted
from
rolfe
island
and
was
swinging
out
into
the
open
pushing
everything
before
it
all
the
men
in
the
village
turned
out
of
bed
and
with
lanterns
in
hand
began
to
clear
the
stores
and
mills
for
it
seemed
that
everything
near
the
river
banks
must
go
before
that
avalanche
of
ice
stephen
and
rufus
were
there
helping
to
save
the
property
of
their
friends
and
neighbors
rose
and
mite
shapley
had
stayed
the
night
with
a
friend
and
all
three
girls
were
shivering
with
fear
and
excitement
as
they
stood
near
the
bridge
watching
the
sight
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
crambry
family
was
on
hand
for
whatever
instincts
they
may
have
lacked
the
instinct
for
being
on
the
spot
when
anything
was
happening
was
present
in
them
to
the
most
remarkable
extent
the
town
was
supporting
them
in
modest
winter
quarters
somewhat
nearer
than
killick
to
the
centre
of
civilization
and
the
first
alarm
brought
them
promptly
to
the
scene
crambry
remarking
at
intervals
if
i
known
there
be
so
many
out
i
ought
to
have
worn
my
bunnit
but
i
ai
got
no
bunnit
an
if
i
had
they
say
i
ai
got
no
head
to
wear
it
on
by
the
time
the
jam
neared
the
falls
it
had
grown
with
its
accumulations
until
it
was
made
up
of
tier
after
tier
of
huge
ice
cakes
piled
side
by
side
and
one
upon
another
with
heaps
of
trees
and
branches
and
drifting
lumber
holding
them
in
place
some
of
the
blocks
stood
erect
and
towered
like
icebergs
and
these
glittering
in
the
lights
of
the
twinkling
lanterns
pushed
solemnly
forward
cracking
crushing
and
cutting
everything
in
their
way
when
the
great
mass
neared
the
planing
mill
on
the
east
shore
the
girls
covered
their
eyes
expecting
to
hear
the
crash
of
the
falling
building
but
impelled
by
the
force
of
some
mysterious
current
it
shook
itself
ponderously
and
then
with
one
magnificent
movement
slid
up
the
river
bank
tier
following
tier
in
grand
confusion
this
left
a
water
way
for
the
main
drift
the
ice
broke
in
every
direction
and
down
down
down
from
bonnie
eagle
and
moderation
swept
the
harvest
of
the
winter
freezing
it
came
thundering
over
the
dam
bringing
boats
farming
implements
posts
supports
and
every
sort
of
floating
lumber
with
it
and
cutting
under
the
flour
mill
tipped
it
cleverly
over
on
its
side
and
went
crashing
on
its
way
down
river
at
edgewood
it
pushed
colossal
blocks
of
ice
up
the
banks
into
the
roadway
piling
them
end
upon
end
ten
feet
in
air
then
tearing
and
rumbling
and
booming
through
the
narrows
it
covered
the
intervale
at
pleasant
point
and
made
a
huge
ice
bridge
below
union
falls
a
bridge
so
solid
that
it
stood
there
for
days
a
sight
for
all
the
neighboring
villages
this
exciting
event
would
have
forever
set
apart
this
winter
from
all
others
in
stephen
memory
even
had
it
not
been
also
the
winter
when
he
was
building
a
house
for
his
future
wife
but
afterwards
in
looking
back
on
the
wild
night
of
the
ice
freshet
stephen
remembered
that
rose
manner
was
strained
and
cold
and
evasive
and
that
when
he
had
seen
her
talking
with
claude
merrill
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
that
whippersnapper
had
looked
at
her
as
no
honorable
man
in
edgewood
ever
looked
at
an
engaged
girl
he
recalled
his
throb
of
gratitude
that
claude
lived
at
a
safe
distance
and
his
subsequent
pang
of
remorse
at
doubting
for
an
instant
rose
fidelity
so
at
length
april
came
the
saco
was
still
high
turbid
and
angry
and
the
boys
were
waiting
at
limington
falls
for
the
ossipee
drive
to
begin
stephen
joined
them
there
for
he
was
restless
and
the
river
called
him
as
it
did
every
spring
each
stubborn
log
that
he
encountered
gave
him
new
courage
and
power
of
overcoming
the
rush
of
the
water
the
noise
and
roar
and
dash
the
exposure
and
danger
all
made
the
blood
run
in
his
veins
like
new
wine
when
he
came
back
to
the
farm
all
the
cobwebs
had
been
blown
from
his
brain
and
his
first
interview
with
rose
was
so
intoxicating
that
he
went
immediately
to
portland
and
bought
in
a
kind
of
secret
penitence
for
his
former
fears
a
pale
for
the
bedroom
in
the
new
home
it
had
once
been
voted
down
by
the
entire
advisory
committee
wiley
said
pink
was
foolish
and
was
always
sure
to
fade
and
the
border
being
a
mass
of
solid
roses
was
five
cents
a
yard
virtually
a
prohibitive
price
wiley
said
he
should
hate
to
hev
a
spell
of
sickness
an
lay
abed
in
a
room
where
there
was
things
growin
all
over
the
place
he
thought
walls
where
you
could
lay
an
count
the
spots
where
the
roof
leaked
was
the
most
entertainin
in
sickness
rose
had
longed
for
the
lovely
pattern
but
had
sided
dutifully
with
the
prudent
majority
so
that
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
unauthorized
and
illegitimate
joy
that
stephen
papered
the
room
at
night
a
few
strips
at
a
time
on
the
third
evening
when
he
had
removed
all
signs
of
his
work
he
lighted
two
kerosene
lamps
and
two
candles
finding
the
effect
under
this
illumination
almost
too
brilliant
and
beautiful
for
belief
rose
should
never
see
it
now
he
determined
until
the
furniture
was
in
place
they
had
already
chosen
the
kitchen
and
bedroom
things
though
they
would
not
be
needed
for
some
months
but
the
rest
was
to
wait
until
summer
when
there
would
be
the
to
spend
stephen
did
not
go
back
to
the
river
farm
till
one
that
night
the
pink
bedroom
held
him
in
fetters
too
powerful
to
break
it
looked
like
the
garden
of
eden
he
thought
to
be
sure
it
was
only
fifteen
feet
square
eden
might
have
been
a
little
larger
possibly
but
otherwise
the
pink
bedroom
had
every
advantage
the
pattern
of
roses
growing
on
a
trellis
was
brighter
than
any
in
june
and
the
border
well
if
the
border
had
been
five
dollars
a
foot
stephen
would
not
have
grudged
the
money
when
he
saw
the
twenty
running
yards
of
rosy
bloom
rioting
under
the
white
ceiling
before
he
blew
out
the
last
light
he
raised
it
high
above
his
head
and
took
one
fond
final
look
it
the
only
place
i
ever
saw
he
thought
that
is
pretty
enough
for
her
she
will
look
just
as
if
she
was
growing
here
with
all
the
other
flowers
and
i
shall
always
think
of
it
as
the
garden
of
eden
i
wonder
if
i
got
the
license
and
the
ring
and
took
her
by
surprise
whether
she
be
married
in
june
instead
of
august
i
could
be
all
ready
if
i
could
only
persuade
her
at
this
moment
stephen
touched
the
summit
of
happiness
and
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
that
as
he
was
dreaming
in
his
garden
of
eden
the
serpent
having
just
arrived
at
edgewood
was
sleeping
peacefully
at
the
house
of
brooks
it
was
the
serpent
fourth
visit
that
season
and
he
explained
to
inquiring
friends
that
his
former
employer
had
sold
the
business
and
that
the
new
management
while
reorganizing
had
determined
to
enlarge
the
premises
the
three
clerks
who
had
been
retained
having
two
vacation
with
half
pay
it
is
extraordinary
how
frequently
wise
serpents
are
retained
by
the
management
on
half
or
even
full
salary
while
the
services
of
the
harmless
doves
are
dispensed
with
and
they
are
set
free
to
flutter
where
they
will
the
serpent
rose
wiley
had
the
brightest
eyes
in
edgewood
it
was
impossible
to
look
at
her
without
realizing
that
her
physical
sight
was
perfect
what
mysterious
species
of
blindness
is
it
that
descends
now
and
then
upon
human
creatures
and
renders
them
incapable
of
judgment
or
discrimination
claude
merrill
was
a
glove
salesman
in
a
boston
store
the
calling
itself
is
undoubtedly
respectable
and
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
a
man
can
sell
gloves
and
still
be
a
man
but
claude
merrill
was
a
manikin
he
inhabited
a
very
narrow
space
behind
a
very
short
counter
but
to
him
it
seemed
the
earth
and
the
fullness
thereof
when
irreproachably
neat
and
even
exquisite
in
dress
he
gave
a
napoleonic
glance
at
his
array
of
to
see
if
the
female
assistant
had
put
them
in
proper
order
for
the
day
when
with
that
wonderful
eye
for
detail
that
had
wafted
him
to
his
present
height
of
power
he
pounced
upon
the
and
found
them
as
he
expected
empty
when
with
masterly
judgment
he
had
made
up
and
ticketed
a
basket
of
misfits
and
odd
sizes
to
attract
the
eyes
of
women
who
were
their
human
counterparts
he
felt
himself
bursting
with
the
pride
and
pomp
of
circumstance
his
cambric
handkerchief
adjusted
in
his
coat
with
the
monogram
corner
well
displayed
a
last
touch
to
the
carefully
trained
lock
on
his
forehead
and
he
was
ready
for
his
customers

oh
but
he
was
in
his
element
was
claude
merrill
though
the
glamour
that
surrounded
him
in
the
minds
of
the
edgewood
girls
did
not
emanate
wholly
from
his
finicky
little
person
something
of
it
was
the
glamour
that
belonged
to
boston
remote
fashionable
gay
rich
almost
inaccessible
boston
which
none
could
see
without
the
expenditure
of
five
or
six
dollars
in
railway
fare
with
the
added
extravagance
of
a
night
in
a
hotel
if
one
would
explore
it
thoroughly
and
come
home
possessed
of
all
its
illimitable
treasures
of
wisdom
and
experience
when
claude
came
to
edgewood
for
a
sunday
or
to
spend
a
vacation
with
his
aunt
he
brought
with
him
something
of
the
magic
of
a
metropolis
suddenly
to
rose
eye
stephen
looked
larger
and
clumsier
his
shoes
were
not
the
proper
sort
his
clothes
were
ordinary
his
neckties
were
years
behind
the
fashion
stephen
dancing
compared
with
claude
was
as
the
deliberate
motion
of
an
ox
to
the
hopping
of
a
neat
little
robin
when
claude
took
a
girl
hand
in
the
grand
it
was
as
if
he
were
about
to
try
on
a
delicate
glove
the
manner
in
which
he
held
his
lady
in
the
polka
or
schottische
made
her
seem
a
queen
mite
shapley
was
so
affected
by
it
that
when
rufus
attempted
to
encircle
her
for
the
mazurka
she
exclaimed
do
act
as
if
you
were
spearing
logs
rufus
of
the
two
men
stephen
had
more
to
say
but
claude
said
more
he
was
thought
brilliant
in
conversation
but
what
wonder
when
one
considered
his
advantages
and
his
dazzling
experiences
he
had
customers
who
were
worth
their
thousands
ladies
whose
fingers
never
touched
ladies
who
would
buy
a
glove
of
anybody
else
if
they
went
to
the
grave
he
lived
with
his
sister
maude
arthurlena
in
a
house
where
there
were
other
boarders
who
could
be
seated
at
meals
all
at
the
same
time
so
immense
was
the
he
ate
his
dinner
at
a
restaurant
daily
and
expended
cents
for
it
without
blenching
he
went
to
the
theatre
once
a
week
and
was
often
accompanied
by
lady
friends
who
were
elegant
dressers
in
a
moment
of
wrath
stephen
had
called
him
a
but
it
was
a
libel
so
short
and
rough
a
means
of
exit
from
his
place
of
power
was
wholly
beneath
claude
dignity
it
was
with
a
pardon
me
miss
dix
that
the
noon
hour
having
arrived
he
squeezed
by
that
slave
and
victim
and
raising
the
hinged
board
that
separated
his
kingdom
from
that
of
the
ribbon
department
passed
out
of
the
store
hat
in
hand
serene
in
the
consciousness
that
though
other
clerks
might
nibble
luncheon
from
a
brown
paper
bag
he
would
speedily
be
indulging
in
an
expensive
repast
and
miss
dix
knew
it
and
it
was
a
part
of
his
almost
invincible
attraction
for
her
it
seemed
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
to
decline
the
attentions
of
such
a
gorgeous
butterfly
of
fashion
simply
because
one
was
engaged
to
marry
another
man
at
some
distant
day
all
edgewood
femininity
united
in
saying
that
there
never
was
such
a
perfect
gentleman
as
claude
merrill
and
during
the
time
when
his
popularity
was
at
its
height
rose
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
stephen
could
have
furnished
the
stuff
for
a
dozen
claudes
and
have
had
enough
left
for
an
ordinary
man
besides
april
gave
place
to
may
and
a
veil
hung
between
the
lovers
an
intangible
thing
not
to
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
but
oh
so
plainly
to
be
felt
rose
hid
herself
thankfully
behind
it
while
stephen
had
not
courage
to
lift
a
corner
she
had
twice
been
seen
driving
with
claude
merrill
that
stephen
knew
but
she
had
explained
that
there
were
errands
to
be
done
that
her
grandfather
had
taken
the
horse
and
that
merrill
escort
had
been
both
opportune
and
convenient
for
these
practical
reasons
claude
was
everywhere
present
the
centre
of
attraction
the
observed
of
all
observers
he
was
irresistible
contagious
almost
epidemic
rose
was
now
gay
now
silent
now
affectionate
now
distant
now
coquettish
in
fine
everything
that
was
capricious
mysterious
agitating
incomprehensible
one
morning
alcestis
crambry
went
to
the
for
stephen
and
brought
him
back
the
newspapers
and
letters
he
had
hung
about
the
river
farm
so
much
that
stephen
finally
gave
him
bed
and
food
in
exchange
for
numberless
small
errands
rufus
was
temporarily
confined
in
a
dark
room
with
some
strange
pain
and
trouble
in
his
eyes
and
alcestis
proved
of
use
in
many
ways
he
had
always
been
rose
slave
and
had
often
brought
messages
and
notes
from
the
brier
neighborhood
so
that
when
stephen
saw
a
folded
note
among
the
papers
his
heart
gave
a
throb
of
anticipation
the
note
was
brief
and
when
he
had
glanced
through
it
he
said
this
is
not
mine
alcestis
it
belongs
to
miss
rose
go
straight
back
and
give
it
to
her
as
you
were
told
and
another
time
keep
your
wits
about
you
or
i
send
you
back
to
killick
alcestis
crambry
ideas
on
all
subjects
were
extremely
vague
claude
merrill
had
given
him
a
letter
for
rose
but
his
notion
was
that
anything
that
belonged
to
her
belonged
to
stephen
and
the
waterman
place
was
much
nearer
than
the
wileys
particularly
at
when
the
boy
had
slouched
away
stephen
sat
under
the
apple
tree
now
a
mass
of
roseate
bloom
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
it
was
not
precisely
a
that
he
had
read
nevertheless
it
blackened
the
light
of
the
sun
for
him
claude
asked
rose
to
meet
him
anywhere
on
the
road
to
the
station
and
to
take
a
little
walk
as
he
was
leaving
that
afternoon
and
could
not
bear
to
say
to
her
in
the
presence
of
her
grandmother
under
the
circumstances
he
wrote
deeply
underlining
the
words
i
can
not
remain
a
moment
longer
in
edgewood
where
i
have
been
so
happy
and
so
miserable
he
did
not
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
time
limit
on
his
expired
that
day
for
his
dramatic
instinct
told
him
that
such
sordid
matters
have
no
place
in
heroics
stephen
sat
motionless
under
the
tree
for
an
hour
deciding
on
some
plan
of
action
he
had
work
at
the
little
house
but
he
did
not
dare
go
there
lest
he
should
see
the
face
of
dead
love
looking
from
the
windows
of
the
pink
bedroom
dead
love
cold
sad
merciless
his
cheeks
burned
as
he
thought
of
the
marriage
license
and
the
gold
ring
hidden
away
upstairs
in
the
drawer
of
his
shaving
stand
what
a
romantic
fool
he
had
been
to
think
he
could
hasten
the
glad
day
by
a
single
moment
what
a
piece
of
boyish
folly
it
had
been
and
how
it
shamed
him
in
his
own
eyes
when
train
time
drew
near
he
took
his
boat
and
paddled
down
stream
if
for
the
finland
lover
reindeer
there
was
but
one
path
in
all
the
world
and
that
the
one
that
led
to
her
so
it
was
for
stephen
canoe
which
had
it
been
set
free
on
the
river
by
day
or
by
night
might
have
floated
straight
to
rose
he
landed
at
the
usual
place
a
bit
of
sandy
shore
near
the
wiley
house
and
walked
drearily
up
the
bank
through
the
woods
under
the
shade
of
the
pines
the
white
stars
of
the
hepatica
glistened
and
the
pale
anemones
were
coming
into
bloom
glowed
red
under
their
glossy
leaves
and
clumps
of
violets
sweetened
the
air
squirrels
chattered
woodpeckers
tapped
thrushes
sang
but
stephen
was
blind
and
deaf
to
all
the
sweet
harbingers
of
spring
just
then
he
heard
voices
realizing
with
a
throb
of
delight
that
at
any
rate
rose
had
not
left
home
to
meet
claude
as
he
had
asked
her
to
do
looking
through
the
branches
he
saw
the
two
standing
together
brooks
horse
with
the
offensive
trunk
in
the
back
of
the
wagon
being
hitched
to
a
tree
near
by
there
was
nothing
in
the
tableau
to
stir
stephen
to
fury
but
he
read
between
the
lines
and
suffered
as
he
read
suffered
and
determined
to
sacrifice
himself
if
he
must
so
that
rose
could
have
what
she
wanted
this
miserable
apology
for
a
man
he
had
never
been
the
husband
for
rose
she
must
take
her
place
in
a
larger
community
worthy
of
her
beauty
and
charm
claude
was
talking
and
gesticulating
ardently
rose
head
was
bent
and
the
tears
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
suddenly
claude
raised
his
hat
and
with
a
passionate
gesture
of
renunciation
walked
swiftly
to
the
wagon
and
looking
back
once
drove
off
with
the
utmost
speed
of
which
the
brooks
horse
was
capable
rose
waving
him
a
farewell
with
one
hand
and
wiping
her
eyes
with
the
other
the
turquoise
ring
stephen
stood
absolutely
still
in
front
of
the
opening
in
the
trees
and
as
rose
turned
she
met
him
face
to
face
she
had
never
dreamed
his
eyes
could
be
so
stern
his
mouth
so
hard
and
she
gave
a
sob
like
a
child
you
seem
to
be
in
trouble
stephen
said
in
a
voice
so
cold
she
thought
it
could
not
be
his
i
am
not
in
trouble
exactly
rose
stammered
concealing
her
discomfiture
as
well
as
possible
i
am
a
little
unhappy
because
i
have
made
some
one
else
unhappy
and
now
that
you
know
it
you
will
be
unhappy
too
and
angry
besides
i
suppose
though
you
seen
everything
there
was
to
see
there
is
no
occasion
for
sorrow
stephen
said
i
did
mean
to
break
in
on
any
interview
i
came
over
to
give
you
back
your
freedom
if
you
ever
cared
enough
for
me
to
marry
me
the
time
has
gone
by
i
am
willing
to
own
that
i
you
but
i
am
not
the
man
to
take
a
girl
against
her
inclinations
so
we
will
say
and
end
the
thing
here
and
now
i
can
only
wish
here
his
smothered
rage
at
fate
almost
choked
him
that
when
you
were
selecting
another
husband
you
had
chosen
a
whole
man
rose
quivered
with
the
scorn
of
his
tone
size
is
everything
she
blazed
not
in
bodies
perhaps
but
it
counts
for
something
in
hearts
and
brains
and
it
is
convenient
to
have
a
sense
of
honor
that
at
least
as
big
as
a
grain
of
claude
merrill
is
not
dishonorable
rose
exclaimed
impetuously
or
at
least
he
is
as
bad
as
you
think
he
has
never
asked
me
to
marry
him
then
he
probably
was
not
quite
ready
to
speak
or
perhaps
you
were
not
quite
ready
to
hear
retorted
stephen
bitterly
but
do
let
us
have
words
there
be
enough
to
regret
without
adding
those
i
have
seen
ever
since
new
year
that
you
were
not
really
happy
or
contented
only
i
would
allow
it
to
myself
i
kept
hoping
against
hope
that
i
was
mistaken
there
have
been
times
when
i
would
have
married
you
willing
or
unwilling
but
i
did
love
you
so
well
then
and
now
that
another
man
in
the
case
it
different
and
i
strong
enough
to
do
the
right
thing
follow
your
heart
and
be
happy
in
a
year
or
two
i
shall
be
glad
i
had
the
grit
to
tell
you
so
rose
rose
pale
with
amazement
summoned
all
her
pride
and
drawing
the
turquoise
engagement
ring
from
her
finger
handed
it
silently
to
stephen
hiding
her
face
as
he
flung
it
vehemently
down
the
his
dull
eyes
followed
it
and
half
uncomprehendingly
saw
it
settle
and
glisten
in
a
nest
of
brown
then
he
put
out
his
hand
for
a
last
clasp
and
strode
away
without
a
word
illustration
hiding
her
face
as
he
flung
it
down
the
presently
rose
heard
first
the
scrape
of
his
boat
on
the
sand
then
the
soft
sound
of
his
paddles
against
the
water
then
nothing
but
the
squirrels
and
the
woodpeckers
and
the
thrushes
then
not
even
these
nothing
but
the
beating
of
her
own
heart
she
sat
down
heavily
feeling
as
if
she
were
wide
awake
for
the
first
time
in
many
weeks
how
had
things
come
to
this
pass
with
her
claude
merrill
had
flattered
her
vanity
and
given
her
some
moments
of
restlessness
and
dissatisfaction
with
her
lot
but
he
had
not
until
really
touched
her
heart
or
tempted
her
even
momentarily
from
her
allegiance
to
stephen
his
eyes
had
always
looked
unspeakable
things
his
voice
had
seemed
to
breathe
feelings
that
he
had
never
dared
put
in
words
but
he
had
really
stirred
her
for
although
he
had
still
been
vague
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
love
for
her
had
passed
all
bounds
of
discretion
she
remembered
his
impassioned
farewells
his
despair
his
doubt
as
to
whether
he
could
forget
her
by
plunging
into
the
vortex
of
business
or
whether
he
had
better
end
it
all
in
the
river
as
so
many
other
fellows
had
done
she
had
been
touched
by
his
misery
even
against
her
better
judgment
and
she
had
intended
to
confess
it
all
to
stephen
sometime
telling
him
that
she
should
never
again
accept
attentions
from
a
stranger
lest
a
tragedy
like
this
should
happen
twice
in
a
lifetime
she
had
imagined
that
stephen
would
be
his
magnanimous
self
and
beg
her
to
forget
this
fascinating
by
resting
in
his
deeper
serener
love
she
had
meant
to
be
contrite
and
faithful
praying
nightly
that
poor
claude
might
live
down
his
present
anguish
of
which
she
had
been
the
innocent
cause
instead
what
had
happened
she
had
been
put
altogether
in
the
wrong
stephen
had
almost
cast
her
off
and
that
too
without
argument
he
had
given
her
her
liberty
before
she
had
asked
for
it
taking
it
for
granted
without
question
that
she
desired
to
be
rid
of
him
instead
of
comforting
her
in
her
remorse
or
sympathizing
with
her
for
so
nobly
refusing
to
shine
in
claude
larger
world
of
boston
stephen
had
assumed
that
she
was
disloyal
in
every
particular
and
pray
how
was
she
to
cope
with
such
a
disagreeable
and
complicated
situation
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
gossips
rolled
under
their
tongues
the
delicious
morsel
of
a
broken
engagement
and
sooner
or
later
she
must
brave
the
displeasure
of
her
grandmother
and
the
little
house
that
was
worse
than
anything
her
tears
flowed
faster
as
she
thought
of
stephen
joy
in
it
of
his
faithful
labor
of
the
savings
he
had
invested
in
it
she
hated
and
despised
her
self
when
she
thought
of
the
house
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
realized
the
limitations
of
her
nature
the
poverty
of
her
ideals
what
should
she
do
she
had
lost
stephen
and
ruined
his
life
now
in
order
that
she
need
not
blight
a
second
career
must
she
contrive
to
return
claude
love
to
be
sure
she
thought
it
seemed
indecent
to
marry
any
other
man
than
stephen
when
they
had
built
a
house
together
and
chosen
and
a
kitchen
stove
and
chairs
but
was
it
not
the
only
way
to
evade
the
difficulties
suppose
that
stephen
in
a
fit
of
pique
should
ask
somebody
else
to
share
the
new
cottage
as
this
dreadful
possibility
came
into
view
rose
sobs
actually
frightened
the
birds
and
the
squirrels
she
paced
back
and
forth
under
the
trees
wondering
how
she
could
have
been
engaged
to
a
man
for
eight
months
and
know
so
little
about
him
as
she
seemed
to
know
about
stephen
waterman
who
would
have
believed
he
could
be
so
autocratic
so
severe
so
unapproachable
who
could
have
foreseen
that
she
rose
wiley
would
ever
be
given
up
to
another
man
handed
over
as
coolly
as
if
she
had
been
a
bale
of
cotton
she
wanted
to
return
claude
merrill
love
because
it
was
the
only
way
out
of
the
tangle
but
at
the
moment
she
almost
hated
him
for
making
so
much
trouble
for
hurting
stephen
for
abasing
her
in
her
own
eyes
and
above
all
for
giving
her
rustic
lover
the
chance
of
impersonating
an
injured
emperor
it
did
not
simplify
the
situation
to
have
mite
shapley
come
in
during
the
evening
and
run
upstairs
uninvited
to
sit
on
the
toot
of
her
bed
and
chatter
rose
had
closed
her
blinds
and
lay
in
the
dark
pleading
a
headache
mite
was
in
high
feather
she
had
met
claude
merrill
going
to
the
station
that
afternoon
he
was
much
too
early
for
the
train
which
the
station
agent
reported
to
be
behind
time
so
he
had
asked
her
to
take
a
drive
she
did
know
how
it
happened
for
he
looked
at
his
watch
every
now
and
then
but
anyway
they
got
to
laughing
and
carrying
on
and
when
they
came
back
to
the
station
the
train
had
gone
was
that
the
greatest
joke
of
the
season
what
did
rose
suppose
they
did
next
rose
did
know
and
did
care
her
head
ached
too
badly
well
they
had
driven
to
wareham
and
claude
had
hired
a
livery
team
there
and
had
been
taken
into
portland
with
his
trunk
and
she
had
brought
brooks
horse
back
to
edgewood
was
that
ridiculous
and
had
she
cut
out
rose
where
she
least
expected
rose
was
distinctly
apathetic
and
mite
shapley
departed
after
a
very
brief
call
leaving
behind
her
an
entirely
new
train
of
thought
if
claude
merrill
were
so
that
he
could
only
by
the
greatest
keep
from
flinging
himself
into
the
river
how
could
he
conceal
his
sufferings
so
completely
from
mite
shapley
little
scheming
coquette
so
that
pretty
merrill
feller
has
gone
has
he
mother
inquired
old
kennebec
that
night
as
he
took
off
his
wet
shoes
and
warmed
his
feet
at
the
kitchen
oven
well
it
ai
a
mite
too
soon
i
allers
distrust
that
kind
of
a
man
one
of
the
most
turrible
things
that
ever
happened
in
was
brought
about
by
jest
sech
a
feller
mothers
hed
hardly
ought
to
name
their
boy
babies
claude
without
they
expect
to
play
the
dickens
with
the
girls
i
don
know
nothin
the
fust
claude
there
ai
none
of
in
the
bible
air
they
but
whoever
he
was
i
bate
ye
he
hed
a
deceivin
tongue
if
it
hed
for
me
that
claude
in
would
run
away
with
my
brother
fust
wife
an
i
tell
ye
jest
how
i
contrived
to
put
a
spoke
in
his
wheel
but
wiley
being
already
somewhat
familiar
with
the
circumstances
had
taken
her
candle
and
retired
to
her
virtuous
couch
rose
sees
the
world
was
this
the
world
after
all
rose
asked
herself
and
if
so
what
was
amiss
with
it
and
where
was
the
charm
the
bewilderment
the
intoxication
the
glamour
she
had
been
glad
to
come
to
boston
for
the
last
two
weeks
in
edgewood
had
proved
intolerable
she
had
always
been
a
favorite
heretofore
from
the
days
when
the
boys
fought
for
the
privilege
of
dragging
her
sled
up
the
hills
and
filling
her
tiny
mitten
with
peppermints
down
to
the
year
when
she
came
home
from
the
wareham
female
seminary
an
acknowledged
belle
and
beauty
suddenly
she
had
felt
her
popularity
dwindling
there
was
no
real
change
in
the
demeanor
of
her
acquaintances
but
there
was
a
certain
subtle
difference
of
atmosphere
everybody
sympathized
tacitly
with
stephen
and
she
did
not
wonder
for
there
were
times
when
she
secretly
took
his
part
against
herself
only
a
few
candid
friends
had
referred
to
the
rupture
openly
in
conversation
but
these
had
been
blunt
in
their
disapproval
it
seemed
part
of
her
ill
fortune
that
just
at
this
time
rufus
should
be
threatened
with
partial
blindness
and
that
stephen
heart
already
sore
should
be
torn
with
new
anxieties
she
could
hardly
bear
to
see
the
doctor
carriage
drive
by
day
after
day
and
hear
night
after
night
that
rufus
was
unresigned
melancholy
half
mad
while
stephen
as
the
doctor
said
was
brother
mother
and
father
in
one
as
gentle
as
a
woman
as
firm
as
gibraltar
these
foes
to
her
peace
of
mind
all
came
from
within
but
without
was
the
hourly
reproach
of
her
grandmother
whose
scorching
tongue
touched
every
sensitive
spot
in
the
girl
nature
and
burned
it
like
fire
finally
a
way
of
escape
opened
mrs
wealthy
brooks
who
had
always
been
rheumatic
grew
suddenly
worse
she
had
heard
of
a
magnetic
physician
in
boston
also
of
one
who
used
electricity
with
wonderful
effect
and
she
announced
her
intention
of
taking
both
treatments
impartially
and
alternately
the
neighbors
were
quite
willing
that
wealthy
ann
brooks
should
spend
the
deceased
ezra
money
in
any
way
she
pleased
she
had
earned
it
goodness
knows
by
living
with
him
for
years
but
before
the
day
for
her
departure
arrived
her
right
arm
and
knee
became
so
much
more
painful
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
travel
alone
at
this
juncture
rose
was
called
upon
to
act
as
nurse
and
companion
in
a
friendly
way
she
seized
the
opportunity
hungrily
as
a
way
out
of
her
present
trouble
but
knowing
what
brooks
temper
was
in
time
of
health
she
could
see
clearly
what
it
was
likely
to
prove
when
pain
and
anguish
wrung
the
brow
rose
had
been
in
boston
now
for
some
weeks
and
she
was
sitting
in
the
joy
street
joy
street
forsooth
it
was
nearly
bedtime
and
she
was
looking
out
upon
a
huddle
of
roofs
and
back
yards
upon
a
landscape
filled
with
and
cats
there
were
no
sleek
country
tabbies
with
the
memory
in
their
eyes
of
tasted
cream
nothing
but
thin
despairing
cats
of
the
pavement
cats
no
more
forlorn
than
rose
herself
illustration
she
had
gone
with
maude
to
claude
store
she
had
seen
boston
for
she
had
accompanied
brooks
in
the
daily
to
the
two
different
temples
of
healing
where
that
lady
worshipped
and
offered
sacrifices
she
had
also
gone
with
maude
arthurlena
to
claude
merrill
store
to
buy
pair
of
gloves
and
had
overheard
miss
dix
the
fashionable
before
mentioned
say
to
miss
brackett
of
the
ribbon
department
that
she
thought
merrill
must
have
worn
his
blinders
that
time
he
stayed
so
long
in
edgewood
this
bit
of
polished
irony
was
unintelligible
to
rose
at
first
but
she
mastered
it
after
an
hour
reflection
she
looking
her
best
that
day
she
knew
the
cotton
dresses
that
seemed
so
pretty
at
home
were
common
and
countrified
here
and
her
best
black
cashmere
looked
cheap
and
shapeless
beside
miss
dix
brilliantine
miss
dix
figure
was
her
strong
point
and
her
dressmaker
was
particularly
skillful
in
the
arts
of
suggestion
concealment
and
revelation
beauty
has
its
chosen
backgrounds
rose
in
white
dimity
standing
knee
deep
in
her
blossoming
brier
bushes
the
river
running
at
her
feet
dark
pine
trees
behind
her
graceful
head
sounded
depths
and
touched
heights
of
harmony
forever
beyond
the
reach
of
the
modish
miss
dix
but
she
was
out
of
her
element
and
suffered
accordingly
rose
had
gone
to
walk
with
claude
one
evening
when
she
first
arrived
he
had
shown
her
the
state
house
and
the
park
street
church
and
sat
with
her
on
one
of
the
benches
in
the
common
until
nearly
ten
she
knew
that
brooks
had
told
her
nephew
of
the
broken
engagement
but
he
made
no
reference
to
the
matter
save
to
congratulate
her
that
she
was
rid
of
a
man
who
was
so
clumsy
so
dull
and
behind
the
times
as
stephen
waterman
saying
that
he
had
always
marveled
she
could
engage
herself
to
anybody
who
could
insult
her
by
offering
her
a
turquoise
ring
claude
was
very
interesting
that
evening
rose
thought
but
rather
gloomy
and
unlike
his
former
self
he
referred
to
his
grave
responsibilities
to
the
frail
health
of
maude
arthurlena
and
to
the
vicissitudes
of
business
he
vaguely
intimated
that
his
daily
life
in
the
store
was
not
so
pleasant
as
it
had
been
formerly
that
there
were
those
he
would
speak
no
more
plainly
who
embarrassed
him
with
undesired
attentions
those
who
without
the
smallest
shadow
of
right
vexed
him
with
petty
jealousies
rose
dared
not
ask
questions
on
so
delicate
a
topic
but
she
remembered
in
a
flash
miss
dix
heavy
eyebrows
snapping
eyes
and
high
color
claude
seemed
very
happy
that
rose
had
come
to
boston
though
he
was
surprised
knowing
what
a
trial
his
aunt
must
be
now
that
she
was
so
helpless
it
was
unfortunate
also
that
rose
could
not
go
on
excursions
without
leaving
his
aunt
alone
or
he
should
have
been
glad
to
offer
his
escort
he
pressed
her
hand
when
he
left
her
at
her
door
telling
her
she
could
never
realize
what
a
comfort
her
friendship
was
to
him
could
never
imagine
how
thankful
he
was
that
she
had
courageously
freed
herself
from
ties
that
in
time
would
have
made
her
wretched
his
heart
was
full
he
said
of
feelings
he
dared
not
utter
but
in
the
near
future
when
certain
clouds
had
rolled
by
he
would
unlock
its
treasures
and
then
but
no
more
he
could
not
trust
himself
rose
felt
as
if
she
were
assuming
one
of
the
characters
in
a
mysterious
romance
such
as
unfolded
itself
only
in
books
or
in
boston
but
thrilling
as
it
was
it
was
nevertheless
extremely
unsatisfactory
convinced
that
claude
merrill
was
passionately
in
love
with
her
one
of
her
reasons
for
coming
to
boston
had
been
to
fall
more
deeply
in
love
with
him
and
thus
heal
some
at
least
of
the
wounds
she
had
inflicted
it
may
have
been
a
foolish
idea
but
after
three
weeks
it
seemed
still
worse
a
useless
one
for
after
several
interviews
she
felt
herself
drifting
farther
and
farther
from
claude
and
if
he
felt
any
burning
ambition
to
make
her
his
own
he
certainly
concealed
it
with
admirable
art
given
up
with
the
most
offensive
magnanimity
by
stephen
and
not
greatly
desired
by
claude
that
seemed
the
present
status
of
proud
rose
wiley
of
the
brier
neighborhood
it
was
june
she
remembered
as
she
leaned
out
of
the
open
window
at
least
it
was
june
in
edgewood
and
she
supposed
for
convenience
sake
they
called
it
june
in
boston
not
that
it
mattered
much
what
the
poor
city
prisoners
called
it
how
beautiful
the
river
would
be
at
home
with
the
trees
along
the
banks
in
full
leaf
how
she
hungered
and
thirsted
for
the
river
to
see
it
sparkle
in
the
sunlight
to
watch
the
moonglade
stretching
from
one
bank
to
the
other
to
hear
the
soft
lap
of
the
water
on
the
shore
and
the
distant
murmur
of
the
falls
at
the
bridge
and
the
brier
neighborhood
would
be
at
its
loveliest
for
the
wild
roses
were
in
blossom
by
now
and
the
little
house
how
sweet
it
must
look
under
the
shade
of
the
elms
with
the
saco
rippling
at
the
back
was
poor
rufus
still
lying
in
a
darkened
room
and
was
stephen
nursing
him
disappointed
stephen
dear
noble
old
stephen
gold
and
pinchbeck
just
then
brooks
groaned
in
the
next
room
and
called
rose
who
went
in
to
minister
to
her
real
needs
or
to
condole
with
her
fancied
ones
whichever
course
of
action
appeared
to
be
the
more
agreeable
at
the
moment
brooks
desired
conversation
it
seemed
or
at
least
she
desired
an
audience
for
a
monologue
for
she
recognized
no
antiphonal
obligations
on
the
part
of
her
listeners
the
doctors
were
not
doing
her
a
speck
of
good
and
she
was
just
squandering
money
in
a
miserable
when
she
might
be
enjoying
poor
health
in
her
own
home
and
she
believe
her
hens
were
receiving
proper
care
and
she
had
forgotten
to
pull
down
the
shades
in
the
spare
room
and
the
sun
would
fade
the
carpet
out
all
white
before
she
got
back
and
she
did
believe
smith
magnetism
was
any
more
use
than
a
cat
foot
nor
electricity
any
better
than
a
bumblebee
buzz
and
she
had
a
great
mind
to
go
home
and
try
lord
from
bonnie
eagle
and
there
was
a
letter
for
rose
on
the
bureau
which
had
come
before
supper
but
the
shiftless
lazy
worthless
landlady
had
forgotten
to
send
it
up
till
just
now
the
letter
was
from
mite
shapley
but
rose
could
read
only
half
of
it
to
brooks
little
beside
the
news
that
the
waterman
barn
the
finest
barn
in
the
whole
township
had
been
struck
by
lightning
and
burned
to
the
ground
stephen
was
away
at
the
time
having
taken
rufus
to
portland
where
an
operation
on
his
eyes
would
shortly
be
performed
at
the
hospital
and
one
of
the
neighbors
was
sleeping
at
the
river
farm
and
taking
care
of
the
cattle
still
the
house
might
not
have
been
saved
but
for
one
of
alcestis
crambry
sudden
bursts
of
common
sense
which
occurred
now
quite
regularly
he
succeeded
not
only
in
getting
the
horses
out
of
the
stalls
but
gave
the
alarm
so
promptly
that
the
whole
neighborhood
was
soon
on
the
scene
of
action
stephen
was
the
only
man
mite
reminded
rose
who
ever
had
any
patience
with
or
took
any
pains
to
teach
alcestis
but
he
never
could
have
expected
to
be
rewarded
in
this
practical
way
the
barn
was
only
partly
insured
and
when
she
had
met
stephen
at
the
station
next
day
and
condoled
with
him
on
his
loss
he
had
said
oh
well
mite
a
little
more
or
less
does
make
much
difference
just
now
the
rest
would
interest
you
brooks
said
rose
precipitately
preparing
to
leave
the
room
something
about
claude
i
suppose
ventured
that
astute
lady
i
think
mite
kind
of
fancied
him
i
do
believe
he
ever
gave
her
any
real
encouragement
but
he
make
love
to
a
pump
claude
merrill
would
and
so
would
his
father
before
him
how
my
sister
abby
made
out
to
land
him
we
never
knew
for
they
said
he
proposed
to
every
woman
in
the
town
of
bingham
not
excepting
the
wooden
indian
girl
in
front
of
the
cigar
store
and
not
one
of
but
our
abby
ever
got
a
chance
to
name
the
day
abby
was
as
set
as
the
everlastin
hills
and
if
she
made
up
her
mind
to
have
a
man
he
could
wriggle
away
from
her
nohow
in
the
world
it
beats
all
how
girls
do
run
after
these
miss
nancy
kind
o
fellers
that
ai
but
little
good
as
beaux
worth
less
than
nothing
as
husbands
rose
scarcely
noticed
what
brooks
said
she
was
too
anxious
to
read
the
rest
of
mite
shapley
letter
in
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
stephen
looks
thin
and
pale
so
it
ran
on
but
he
does
not
allow
anybody
to
sympathize
with
him
i
think
you
ought
to
know
something
that
i
have
told
you
before
for
fear
of
hurting
your
feelings
but
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
like
to
hear
everything
and
then
you
know
how
to
act
when
you
come
home
just
after
you
left
stephen
plowed
up
all
the
land
in
front
of
your
new
house
every
inch
of
it
all
up
and
down
the
road
between
the
fence
and
the
front
and
then
he
planted
corn
where
you
were
going
to
have
your
he
has
closed
all
the
blinds
and
hung
a
let
sign
on
the
large
elm
at
the
gate
stephen
never
was
spiteful
in
his
life
but
this
looks
a
little
like
spite
perhaps
he
only
wanted
to
save
his
and
let
people
know
that
everything
between
you
was
over
forever
perhaps
he
thought
it
would
stop
talk
once
and
for
all
but
you
wo
mind
you
lucky
girl
staying
nearly
three
months
in
boston
so
almira
purled
on
in
violet
ink
with
shaded
letters
how
i
wish
it
had
come
my
way
though
i
not
good
at
rubbing
rheumatic
patients
even
when
they
are
his
aunt
is
he
as
devoted
as
ever
and
when
will
it
be
how
do
you
like
the
theatre
mother
thinks
you
wo
attend
but
by
what
he
used
to
say
i
am
sure
church
members
in
boston
always
go
to
amusements
your
loving
friend
almira
shapley
they
say
rufus
doctor
bills
here
and
the
operation
and
hospital
expenses
in
portland
will
mount
up
to
five
hundred
dollars
of
course
stephen
will
be
dreadfully
hampered
by
the
loss
of
his
barn
and
maybe
he
wants
to
let
your
house
that
was
to
be
because
he
really
needs
money
in
that
case
the
dooryard
wo
be
very
attractive
to
tenants
with
corn
planted
right
up
to
the
steps
and
no
path
left
it
two
feet
tall
now
and
by
august
just
when
you
were
intending
to
move
in
it
will
hide
the
front
windows
not
that
you
care
with
a
diamond
on
your
engagement
finger
the
letter
was
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
stand
and
rose
flung
herself
on
her
bed
to
think
and
regret
and
repent
and
if
possible
to
sob
herself
to
sleep
she
knew
now
that
she
had
never
admired
and
respected
stephen
so
much
as
at
the
moment
when
under
the
reproach
of
his
eyes
she
had
given
him
back
his
ring
when
she
left
edgewood
and
parted
with
him
forever
she
had
really
loved
him
better
than
when
she
had
promised
to
marry
him
claude
merrill
on
his
native
boston
heath
did
not
appear
the
romantic
inspiring
figure
he
had
once
been
in
her
eyes
a
week
ago
she
distrusted
him
she
despised
him
what
had
happened
to
rose
was
the
dilation
of
her
vision
she
saw
things
under
a
wider
sky
and
in
a
clearer
light
above
all
her
heart
was
wrung
with
pity
for
stephen
stephen
with
no
comforting
hand
to
help
him
in
his
sore
trouble
stephen
bearing
his
losses
alone
his
burdens
and
anxieties
alone
his
nursing
and
daily
work
alone
oh
how
she
felt
herself
needed
needed
that
was
the
magic
word
that
unlocked
her
better
nature
darkness
is
the
time
for
making
roots
and
establishing
plants
whether
of
the
soil
or
of
the
soul
and
all
at
once
rose
had
become
a
woman
a
little
one
perhaps
but
a
whole
woman
and
a
bit
of
an
angel
too
with
healing
in
her
wings
when
and
how
had
this
metamorphosis
come
about
last
summer
the
fragile
had
hung
over
the
river
and
looked
at
its
pretty
reflection
in
the
placid
surface
of
the
water
its
few
buds
and
blossoms
were
so
lovely
it
sighed
for
nothing
more
the
changes
in
the
plant
had
been
wrought
secretly
and
silently
in
some
mysterious
way
as
common
to
soul
as
to
plant
life
the
roots
had
gathered
in
more
nourishment
from
the
earth
they
had
stored
up
strength
and
force
and
all
at
once
there
was
a
marvelous
fructifying
of
the
plant
hardiness
of
stalk
new
shoots
everywhere
vigorous
leafage
and
a
shower
of
blossoms
but
everything
was
awry
boston
was
a
failure
claude
was
a
weakling
and
a
flirt
her
turquoise
ring
was
lying
on
the
stephen
did
not
love
her
any
longer
her
were
plowed
up
and
planted
in
corn
and
the
cottage
that
stephen
had
built
and
she
had
furnished
that
beloved
cottage
was
to
let
she
was
in
boston
but
what
did
that
amount
to
after
all
what
was
the
state
house
to
a
bleeding
heart
or
the
old
south
church
to
a
pride
wounded
like
hers
at
last
she
fell
asleep
but
it
was
only
by
stopping
her
ears
to
the
noises
of
the
city
streets
and
making
herself
imagine
the
sound
of
the
river
rippling
under
her
bedroom
windows
at
home
the
back
yards
of
boston
faded
and
in
their
place
came
the
banks
of
the
saco
strewn
with
pine
needles
fragrant
with
wild
flowers
then
there
was
the
bit
of
sunny
beach
where
stephen
moored
his
boat
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
his
paddle
boston
lovers
came
in
the
but
hers
had
floated
down
stream
to
her
just
at
dusk
in
a
canoe
or
sometimes
in
the
moonlight
on
a
couple
of
logs
rafted
together
but
it
was
all
over
now
and
she
could
see
only
stephen
stern
face
as
he
flung
the
despised
turquoise
ring
down
the
river
bank
a
country
chevalier
it
was
early
in
august
when
mrs
wealthy
brooks
announced
her
speedy
return
from
boston
to
edgewood
it
jest
as
well
rose
is
comin
back
said
wiley
to
his
wife
i
never
favored
her
goin
to
boston
where
that
claude
feller
is
when
he
was
down
here
he
was
kep
kind
o
tied
up
in
a
boxstall
but
there
he
caperin
loose
round
the
pastur
i
should
think
rose
would
be
ashamed
to
come
back
after
the
way
carried
on
remarked
wiley
but
if
she
needed
punishment
i
guess
she
got
it
bein
to
wealthy
ann
brooks
bein
a
church
member
in
good
an
standin
i
wealthy
ann
go
to
heaven
but
i
can
only
say
that
it
would
be
a
sight
pleasanter
place
for
a
good
many
if
she
did
rose
has
foolish
an
flirty
an
allowed
her
grandfather
but
it
wo
do
no
good
to
treat
her
like
a
hardened
criminile
same
you
did
afore
she
went
away
she
ai
hardly
got
her
wisdom
teeth
cut
in
love
affairs
she
ai
broke
the
laws
of
the
state
o
maine
nor
any
o
the
ten
commandments
she
ai
disgraced
the
family
an
there
a
chance
for
her
to
reform
seein
as
how
she
twenty
year
old
yet
i
was
turrible
wild
an
myself
afore
you
ketched
me
an
tamed
me
down
you
ai
so
tame
now
as
i
wish
you
was
wiley
replied
testily
if
you
could
smoke
a
clay
pipe
would
calm
your
nerves
mother
help
you
to
git
some
philosophy
inter
you
you
need
a
little
philosophy
turrible
bad
i
need
patience
more
was
wiley
withering
retort
that
the
way
with
folks
said
old
kennebec
reflectively
as
he
went
on
peacefully
puffing
if
you
try
to
indoose
to
take
an
in
a
virtue
they
wo
look
at
it
but
they
run
down
a
side
street
an
buy
half
a
yard
more
o
some
turrible
old
shopworn
trait
character
that
they
kep
in
stock
all
their
lives
an
that
everybody
sick
to
death
of
there
was
a
man
in
but
alas
the
experiences
of
the
gardiner
man
though
told
in
the
same
delightful
fashion
that
had
won
wiley
heart
many
years
before
now
fell
upon
the
empty
air
in
these
years
of
old
anecdotage
his
pipe
was
his
best
listener
and
his
truest
confidant
wiley
constant
intercessions
with
his
wife
made
rose
somewhat
easier
and
the
sight
of
her
own
room
and
belongings
soothed
her
troubled
spirit
but
the
days
went
on
and
nothing
happened
to
change
the
situation
she
had
lost
a
lover
that
was
all
and
there
were
plenty
more
to
choose
from
or
there
always
had
been
but
the
only
one
she
wanted
was
the
one
who
made
no
sign
she
used
to
think
that
she
could
twist
stephen
around
her
little
finger
that
she
had
only
to
beckon
to
him
and
he
would
follow
her
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
now
fear
had
entered
her
heart
she
no
longer
felt
sure
because
she
no
longer
felt
worthy
of
him
and
feeling
both
uncertainty
and
unworthiness
her
lips
were
sealed
and
she
was
rendered
incapable
of
making
any
bid
for
forgiveness
so
the
little
world
of
pleasant
river
went
on
to
all
outward
seeming
as
it
had
ever
gone
on
one
side
of
the
stream
a
girl
heart
was
longing
and
pining
and
sickening
with
hope
deferred
and
growing
too
with
such
astonishing
rapidity
that
the
very
angels
marveled
and
on
the
other
a
man
whole
vision
of
life
an
duty
was
widening
and
deepening
under
the
fructifying
influence
of
his
sorrow
the
corn
waved
high
and
green
in
front
of
the
vacant
riverside
cottage
but
stephen
sent
no
word
or
message
to
rose
he
had
seen
her
once
but
only
from
a
distance
she
seemed
paler
and
thinner
he
thought
the
result
probably
of
her
metropolitan
gayeties
he
heard
no
rumor
of
any
engagement
and
he
wondered
if
it
were
possible
that
her
love
for
claude
merrill
had
not
after
all
been
returned
in
kind
this
seemed
a
wild
impossibility
his
mind
refused
to
entertain
the
supposition
that
any
man
on
earth
could
resist
falling
in
love
with
rose
or
having
fallen
in
that
he
could
ever
contrive
to
climb
out
so
he
worked
on
at
his
farm
harder
than
ever
and
grew
soberer
and
more
careworn
daily
rufus
had
never
seemed
so
near
and
dear
to
him
as
in
these
weeks
when
he
had
lived
under
the
shadow
of
threatened
blindness
the
burning
of
the
barn
and
the
strain
upon
their
slender
property
brought
the
brothers
together
shoulder
to
shoulder
if
you
lose
your
girl
steve
said
the
boy
and
i
lose
my
eyesight
and
we
both
lose
the
barn
why
it
be
us
two
against
the
world
for
a
spell
the
to
let
sign
on
the
little
house
was
an
arrant
piece
of
hypocrisy
nothing
but
the
direst
extremity
could
have
caused
him
to
allow
an
alien
step
on
that
sacred
threshold
the
plowing
up
of
the
and
planting
of
the
corn
had
served
a
double
purpose
it
showed
the
too
curious
public
the
finality
of
his
break
with
rose
and
her
absolute
freedom
it
also
prevented
them
from
suspecting
that
he
still
entered
the
place
his
visits
were
not
many
but
he
could
not
bear
to
let
the
dust
settle
on
the
furniture
that
he
and
rose
had
chosen
together
and
whenever
he
locked
the
door
and
went
back
to
the
river
farm
he
thought
of
a
verse
in
the
bible
therefore
the
lord
god
sent
him
forth
from
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
ground
from
whence
he
was
taken
it
was
now
friday
of
the
last
week
in
august
the
river
was
full
of
logs
thousands
upon
thousands
of
them
covering
the
surface
of
the
water
from
the
bridge
almost
up
to
the
brier
neighborhood
the
edgewood
drive
was
late
owing
to
a
long
drought
and
low
water
but
it
was
to
begin
on
the
following
monday
and
lije
dennett
and
his
under
boss
were
looking
over
the
situation
and
planning
the
campaign
as
they
leaned
over
the
they
saw
wiley
driving
down
the
river
road
when
he
caught
sight
of
them
he
hitched
the
old
white
horse
at
the
corner
and
walked
toward
them
filling
his
pipe
the
while
in
his
usual
leisurely
manner
we
not
busy
this
forenoon
said
lije
dennett
we
stand
right
here
and
let
old
kennebec
have
his
say
out
for
once
we
never
heard
the
end
of
one
of
his
stories
an
he
talkin
for
twenty
years
all
right
rejoined
his
companion
with
a
broad
grin
at
the
idea
willin
if
you
are
but
who
goin
to
tell
our
the
reason
we
deserted
i
bate
yer
we
budge
till
the
crack
o
doom
the
road
commissioner
come
along
once
a
year
and
mend
the
bridge
under
our
feet
but
old
kennebec
talk
straight
on
till
the
day
jedgment
wiley
had
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
mornings
of
his
life
and
felt
that
after
half
a
century
of
neglect
his
powers
were
at
last
appreciated
by
his
he
proposed
numerous
strategic
movements
to
be
made
upon
the
logs
whereby
they
would
move
more
swiftly
than
usual
he
described
several
successful
drives
on
the
kennebec
when
the
logs
had
melted
down
the
river
almost
by
magic
owing
to
his
generalship
and
he
paid
a
tribute
in
passing
to
the
docility
of
the
boss
who
on
that
occasion
had
never
moved
a
single
log
without
asking
his
advice
from
this
topic
he
proceeded
genially
to
narrate
the
of
the
boss
the
under
boss
and
several
indians
belonging
to
the
crew
histories
in
which
he
himself
played
a
gallant
and
conspicuous
part
the
conversation
then
drifted
naturally
to
the
exploits
of
in
general
and
wiley
narrated
the
sorts
of
feats
in
and
the
shooting
of
rapids
that
he
had
done
in
his
youth
these
stories
were
such
as
had
seldom
been
heard
by
the
ear
of
man
and
as
they
passed
into
circulation
instantaneously
we
are
probably
enjoying
some
of
them
to
this
day
they
were
still
being
told
when
a
crambry
child
appeared
on
the
bridge
bearing
a
note
for
the
old
man
upon
reading
it
he
moved
off
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
store
ejaculating
bless
my
soul
i
clean
forgot
that
saleratus
and
mother
settin
at
the
kitchen
table
with
the
bowl
in
her
lap
waitin
for
it
got
so
in
your
i
never
thought
o
the
time
the
connubial
discussion
that
followed
this
breach
of
discipline
began
on
the
arrival
of
the
saleratus
and
lasted
through
supper
and
rose
went
to
bed
almost
immediately
afterward
for
very
dullness
and
apathy
her
life
stretched
out
before
her
in
the
most
aimless
and
monotonous
fashion
she
saw
nothing
but
heartache
in
the
future
and
that
she
richly
deserved
it
made
it
none
the
easier
to
bear
feeling
feverish
and
sleepless
she
slipped
on
her
gray
shaker
cloak
and
stole
quietly
downstairs
for
a
breath
of
air
her
grandfather
and
grandmother
were
talking
on
the
piazza
and
good
humor
seemed
to
have
been
restored
i
was
over
to
the
tavern
she
heard
him
say
as
she
sat
down
at
a
little
distance

there

her
grandmother
caustic
reply
and
then
paid
no
further
attention
until
her
keen
ear
caught
the
sound
of
stephen
name
it
was
a
part
of
her
unhappiness
that
since
her
broken
engagement
no
one
would
ever
allude
to
him
and
she
longed
to
hear
him
mentioned
so
that
perchance
she
could
get
some
inkling
of
his
movements
illustration
as
long
as
stephen
waterman

glad
if
rose
an
stephen
do
make
it
up
for
wealthy
ann
brooks
gossip
is
too
much
for
a
christian
woman
to
stand
housebreaking
where
was
the
pale
rose
the
faded
rose
that
crept
noiselessly
down
from
her
room
wanting
neither
to
speak
nor
to
be
spoken
to
nobody
ever
knew
she
vanished
forever
and
in
her
place
a
thing
of
sparkles
and
dimples
flashed
up
the
stairway
and
closed
the
door
softly
there
was
a
streak
of
moonshine
lying
across
the
bare
floor
and
a
merry
ghost
with
held
prettily
away
from
bare
feet
danced
a
gay
fandango
among
the
yellow
moonbeams
there
were
breathless
flights
to
the
open
window
and
kisses
thrown
in
the
direction
of
the
river
farm
there
were
impressive
declamations
at
the
where
a
radiant
creature
pointed
to
her
reflection
and
whispered
worthless
little
pig
he
loves
you
after
all
then
when
quiet
joy
had
taken
the
place
of
mad
delight
there
was
a
swoop
down
upon
the
floor
an
impetuous
hiding
of
brimming
eyes
in
the
white
counterpane
and
a
dozen
impassioned
promises
to
herself
and
to
something
higher
than
herself
to
be
a
better
girl
the
mood
lasted
and
deepened
and
still
rose
did
not
move
her
heart
was
on
its
knees
before
stephen
faithful
love
his
chivalry
his
strength
her
troubled
spirit
like
a
frail
boat
tossed
about
in
the
rapids
seemed
entering
a
quiet
harbor
where
there
were
protecting
shores
and
a
still
still
evening
star
her
sails
were
all
torn
and
drooping
but
the
harbor
was
in
sight
and
the
poor
little
craft
could
rest
in
peace
a
period
of
grave
reflection
now
ensued
under
the
bedclothes
where
one
could
think
better
suddenly
an
inspiration
seized
her
an
inspiration
so
original
so
delicious
and
above
all
so
humble
and
praiseworthy
that
it
brought
her
head
from
her
pillow
and
she
sat
bolt
upright
clapping
her
hands
like
a
child
the
very
thing
she
whispered
to
herself
gleefully
it
will
take
courage
but
i
sure
of
my
ground
after
what
he
said
before
them
all
and
i
do
it
grandma
in
biddeford
buying
church
carpets
stephen
in
portland
was
ever
such
a
chance
the
same
glowing
rose
came
downstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
next
morning
bade
her
grandmother
with
suspicious
pleasure
and
sent
her
grandfather
away
on
an
errand
which
with
attendant
conversation
would
consume
half
the
day
then
bundles
after
bundles
and
baskets
after
baskets
were
packed
into
the
wagon
behind
the
seat
beneath
the
seat
and
finally
under
the
she
gave
a
dramatic
flourish
to
the
whip
drove
across
the
bridge
went
through
pleasant
river
village
and
up
the
leafy
road
to
the
little
house
stared
the
to
let
sign
scornfully
in
the
eye
alighted
and
ran
like
a
deer
through
the
aisles
of
waving
corn
past
the
kitchen
windows
to
the
back
door
if
he
has
kept
the
big
key
in
the
old
place
under
the
stone
where
we
both
used
to
find
it
then
he
has
forgotten
me
or
anything
thought
rose
the
key
was
there
and
rose
lifted
it
with
a
sob
of
gratitude
it
was
but
five
minutes
work
to
carry
all
the
bundles
from
the
wagon
to
the
back
steps
and
another
five
to
lead
old
tom
across
the
road
into
the
woods
and
tie
him
to
a
tree
quite
out
of
the
sight
of
any
when
after
running
back
she
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
her
heart
gave
a
leap
almost
of
terror
and
she
started
at
the
sound
of
her
own
footfall
through
the
open
door
the
sunlight
streamed
into
the
dark
room
she
flew
to
tables
and
chairs
and
gave
a
rapid
sweep
of
the
hand
over
their
surfaces
he
has
been
dusting
here
and
within
a
few
days
too
she
thought
triumphantly
the
kitchen
was
perfection
as
she
always
knew
it
would
be
with
one
door
opening
to
the
shaded
road
and
the
other
looking
on
the
river
windows
too
framing
the
and
the
elms
she
had
chosen
the
furniture
but
how
differently
it
looked
now
that
it
was
actually
in
place
the
tiny
shed
had
piles
of
split
wood
with
great
boxes
of
kindlings
and
shavings
all
in
readiness
for
the
bride
who
would
do
her
own
cooking
who
but
stephen
would
have
made
the
very
wood
ready
for
a
woman
and
why
had
he
done
so
much
in
may
when
they
were
not
to
be
married
until
august
then
the
door
of
the
bedroom
was
stealthily
opened
and
here
rose
sat
down
and
cried
for
joy
and
shame
and
hope
and
fear
the
very
flowered
paper
she
had
refused
as
too
expensive
how
lovely
it
looked
with
the
white
chamber
set
she
brought
in
her
simple
wedding
outfit
of
blankets
and
counterpanes
and
folded
them
softly
in
the
closet
and
then
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
she
went
from
room
to
room
doing
all
that
could
remain
undiscovered
even
to
laying
a
fire
in
the
new
kitchen
stove
this
was
the
plan
stephen
must
pass
the
house
on
his
way
from
the
river
farm
to
the
bridge
where
he
was
to
join
the
on
monday
morning
she
would
be
out
of
bed
by
the
earliest
peep
of
dawn
put
on
stephen
favorite
pink
calico
leave
a
note
for
her
grandmother
run
like
a
hare
down
her
side
of
the
river
and
up
stephen
steal
into
the
house
open
blinds
and
windows
light
the
fire
and
set
the
kettle
boiling
then
with
a
sharp
knife
she
would
cut
down
two
rows
of
corn
and
thus
make
a
green
pathway
from
the
front
kitchen
steps
to
the
road
next
the
false
and
insulting
to
let
sign
would
be
forcibly
tweaked
from
the
tree
and
thrown
into
the
grass
she
would
then
lay
the
table
in
the
kitchen
and
make
ready
the
nicest
breakfast
that
two
people
ever
sat
down
to
and
oh
would
two
people
sit
down
to
it
or
would
one
go
off
in
a
rage
and
the
other
die
of
grief
and
disappointment
then
having
done
all
she
would
wait
and
palpitate
and
palpitate
and
wait
until
stephen
came
surely
no
in
the
universe
could
drive
along
a
road
observe
his
corn
leveled
to
the
earth
his
sign
removed
his
house
open
and
smoke
issuing
from
his
chimney
without
going
in
to
surprise
the
rogue
and
villain
who
could
be
guilty
of
such
vandalism
and
when
he
came
in
oh
she
had
all
day
sunday
in
which
to
forecast
with
mingled
dread
and
gladness
and
suspense
that
first
moment
all
day
sunday
to
frame
and
unframe
penitent
speeches
all
day
sunday
would
it
ever
be
monday
if
so
what
would
tuesday
bring
would
the
sun
rise
on
happy
stephen
waterman
of
pleasant
river
or
on
miserable
miss
rose
wiley
of
the
brier
neighborhood
the
dream
room
long
ago
when
stephen
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
he
had
gone
with
his
father
to
a
distant
town
to
spend
the
night
after
an
early
breakfast
next
morning
his
father
had
driven
off
for
a
business
interview
and
left
the
boy
to
walk
about
during
his
absence
he
wandered
aimlessly
along
a
quiet
side
street
and
threw
himself
down
on
the
grass
outside
a
pretty
garden
to
amuse
himself
as
best
he
could
after
a
few
minutes
he
heard
voices
and
turning
peeped
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
in
idle
boyish
curiosity
it
was
a
small
brown
house
the
kitchen
door
was
open
and
a
table
spread
with
a
white
cloth
was
set
in
the
middle
of
the
room
there
was
a
cradle
in
a
far
corner
and
a
man
was
seated
at
the
table
as
though
he
might
be
waiting
for
his
breakfast
there
is
a
kind
of
sentiment
about
the
kitchen
in
new
england
a
kind
of
sentiment
not
provoked
by
other
rooms
here
the
farmer
drops
in
to
spend
a
few
minutes
when
he
comes
back
from
the
barn
or
field
on
an
errand
here
in
the
great
clean
sweet
comfortable
place
the
busy
housewife
lives
sometimes
rocking
the
cradle
sometimes
opening
and
shutting
the
oven
door
sometimes
stirring
the
pot
darning
stockings
paring
vegetables
or
mixing
goodies
in
a
yellow
bowl
the
children
sit
on
the
steps
stringing
beans
shelling
peas
or
hulling
berries
the
cat
sleeps
on
the
floor
near
the
and
the
visitor
feels
exiled
if
he
stays
in
or
parlor
for
here
where
the
mother
is
always
busy
is
the
heart
of
the
there
was
an
open
back
door
to
this
kitchen
a
door
framed
in
and
the
woman
or
was
she
only
girl
standing
at
the
stove
was
pretty
oh
so
pretty
in
stephen
eyes
his
boyish
heart
went
out
to
her
on
the
instant
she
poured
a
cup
of
coffee
and
walked
with
it
to
the
table
then
an
unexpected
interesting
thing
happened
something
the
boy
ought
not
to
have
seen
and
never
forgot
the
man
putting
out
his
hand
to
take
the
cup
looked
up
at
the
pretty
woman
with
a
smile
and
she
stooped
and
kissed
him
stephen
was
fifteen
as
he
looked
on
the
instant
he
became
a
man
with
a
man
hopes
desires
ambitions
he
looked
eagerly
hungrily
and
the
scene
burned
itself
on
the
sensitive
plate
of
his
young
heart
so
that
as
he
grew
older
he
could
take
the
picture
out
in
the
dark
from
time
to
time
and
look
at
it
again
when
he
first
met
rose
he
did
not
know
precisely
what
she
was
to
mean
to
him
but
before
long
when
he
closed
his
eyes
and
the
old
familiar
picture
swam
into
his
field
of
vision
behold
by
some
spiritual
chemistry
the
pretty
woman
face
had
given
place
to
that
of
rose
all
such
teasing
visions
had
been
sternly
banished
during
this
sorrowful
summer
and
it
was
a
thoughtful
sober
stephen
who
drove
along
the
road
on
this
mellow
august
morning
the
dust
was
deep
the
goldenrod
waved
its
imperial
plumes
making
the
humble
waysides
gorgeous
the
river
chattered
and
sparkled
till
it
met
the
logs
at
the
brier
neighorhood
and
then
lapsing
into
silence
flowed
steadily
under
them
till
it
found
a
vent
for
its
spirits
in
the
dashing
and
splashing
of
the
falls
haying
was
over
logging
was
to
begin
that
day
then
harvesting
then
then
eternal
successions
of
plowing
sowing
reaping
haying
logging
harvesting
and
so
on
to
the
endless
end
of
his
days
here
and
there
a
red
or
a
yellow
branch
painted
only
yesterday
caught
his
eye
and
made
him
shiver
he
was
not
ready
for
winter
his
heart
still
craved
the
summer
it
had
missed
hello
what
was
that
prone
on
the
earth
sign
torn
down
and
lying
flat
in
the
grass
blinds
open
fire
in
the
chimney
he
leaped
from
the
wagon
and
flinging
the
reins
to
alcestis
crambry
said
stay
right
here
out
of
sight
and
do
you
move
till
i
call
you
and
striding
up
the
green
pathway
flung
open
the
kitchen
door
a
forest
of
corn
waving
in
the
doorway
at
the
back
clambering
round
and
round
the
table
with
shining
white
cloth
kettle
humming
and
steaming
something
bubbling
in
a
pan
on
the
stove
fire
throwing
out
sweet
little
gleams
of
welcome
through
the
open
damper
all
this
was
taken
in
with
one
incredulous
rapturous
twinkle
of
an
eye
but
something
else
too
rose
of
all
roses
rose
of
the
river
rose
of
the
world
standing
behind
a
chair
her
hand
pressed
against
her
heart
her
lips
parted
her
breath
coming
and
going
she
was
glowing
like
a
jewel
glowing
with
the
extraordinary
brilliancy
that
emotion
gives
to
some
women
she
used
to
be
happy
in
a
gay
sparkling
way
like
the
shallow
part
of
the
stream
as
it
chatters
over
white
pebbles
and
bright
sands
now
it
was
a
broad
steady
full
happiness
like
the
deeps
of
the
river
under
the
sun
do
speak
stephen
till
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
it
takes
a
good
deal
of
courage
for
a
girl
to
do
as
i
am
doing
but
i
want
to
show
how
sorry
i
am
and
it
the
only
way
she
was
trembling
and
the
words
came
faster
and
faster
i
been
very
wrong
and
foolish
and
made
you
very
unhappy
but
i
have
done
what
you
would
have
hated
most
i
have
been
engaged
to
claude
merrill
he
has
so
much
as
asked
me
i
am
here
to
beg
you
to
forgive
me
to
eat
breakfast
with
me
to
drive
me
to
the
minister
and
marry
me
quickly
quickly
before
anything
happens
to
prevent
us
and
then
to
bring
me
home
here
to
live
all
the
days
of
my
life
oh
stephen
dear
honestly
honestly
you
have
lost
anything
in
all
this
long
miserable
summer
i
suffered
too
and
better
worth
loving
than
i
was
will
you
take
me
back
rose
had
a
tremendous
power
of
provoking
and
holding
love
and
stephen
of
loving
his
was
too
generous
a
nature
for
revilings
and
complaints
and
reproaches
the
shores
of
his
heart
were
strewn
with
the
wreckage
of
the
troubled
summer
but
if
the
tide
of
love
is
high
enough
it
washes
such
things
out
of
remembrance
he
just
opened
his
arms
and
took
rose
to
his
heart
faults
and
all
with
joy
and
gratitude
and
she
was
as
happy
as
a
child
who
has
escaped
the
scolding
it
richly
deserved
and
who
determines
for
very
thankfulness
sake
never
to
be
naughty
again
illustration
do
speak
stephen
till
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
you
do
know
what
you
done
for
me
stephen
she
whispered
with
her
face
hidden
on
his
shoulder
i
was
just
a
common
little
prickly
rosebush
when
you
came
along
like
a
good
gardener
and
something
better
the
something
better
was
your
love
stephen
dear
and
it
made
everything
different
the
silly
rose
you
were
engaged
to
long
ago
has
disappeared
somewhere
i
hope
you
wo
be
able
to
find
her
under
the
new
leaves
she
was
all
i
wanted
said
stephen
you
thought
she
was
the
girl
answered
because
you
did
see
the
prickles
but
you
have
felt
them
sometime
the
old
rose
was
a
selfish
thing
not
good
enough
for
you
the
new
rose
is
going
to
be
your
wife
and
rufus
sister
and
your
mother
daughter
all
in
one
then
such
a
breakfast
was
spread
as
stephen
in
his
sorry
years
of
bachelor
existence
had
forgotten
could
exist
but
before
he
broke
his
fast
he
ran
out
to
the
wagon
and
served
the
astonished
alcestis
with
his
wedding
refreshments
then
and
there
bidding
him
drive
back
to
the
river
farm
and
bring
him
a
package
that
lay
in
the
drawer
of
his
a
package
placed
there
when
hot
youth
and
love
and
longing
had
inspired
him
to
hurry
on
the
marriage
day
there
an
envelope
alcestis
he
cried
a
long
envelope
way
way
back
in
the
corner
and
a
small
box
on
top
of
it
bring
them
both
and
my
wallet
too
and
if
you
find
them
all
and
get
them
to
me
safely
you
shall
be
bridesmaid
and
groomsman
and
best
man
and
usher
and
maid
of
honor
at
a
wedding
in
less
than
an
hour
off
with
you
drive
straight
and
use
the
whip
on
dolly
when
he
reentered
the
kitchen
flushed
with
joy
and
excitement
rose
put
the
various
good
things
on
the
table
and
he
almost
tremblingly
took
his
seat
fearing
that
contact
with
the
solid
wood
might
wake
him
from
this
entrancing
vision
i
like
to
put
you
in
your
chair
like
a
queen
and
wait
on
you
he
said
with
a
soft
boyish
stammer
but
i
am
too
dazed
with
happiness
to
be
of
any
use
it
my
turn
to
wait
upon
you
and
i
oh
how
i
love
to
have
you
dazed
rose
answered
i
be
at
the
table
presently
myself
but
we
have
been
housekeeping
only
three
minutes
and
we
have
nothing
but
the
tin
this
morning
so
i
pour
the
coffee
from
the
stove
she
filled
a
cup
with
housewifely
care
and
brought
it
to
stephen
side
as
she
set
it
down
and
was
turning
she
caught
his
look
a
look
so
full
of
longing
that
no
loving
woman
however
busy
could
have
resisted
it
then
she
stooped
and
kissed
him
fondly
fervently
stephen
put
his
arm
about
her
and
drawing
her
down
to
his
knee
rested
his
head
against
her
soft
shoulder
with
a
sigh
of
comfort
like
that
of
a
tired
child
he
had
waited
for
it
ten
years
and
at
last
the
had
come
true
