conclusion
chapter
i
a
question
of
midshipman
honor
how
can
a
midshipman
and
gentleman
act
in
that
way
the
voice
of
midshipman
david
darrin
united
states
navy
vibrated
uneasily
as
he
turned
to
his
comrades
it
a
shame
that
what
it
is
quivered
farley
also
of
the
third
class
at
the
united
states
naval
academy
but
the
question
is
propounded
midshipman
dan
dalzell
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
is
it
any
part
of
our
business
to
bother
with
the
fellow
demanded
farley
half
savagely
now
farley
was
rather
though
he
was
all
there
in
points
that
involved
the
honor
of
the
brigade
of
midshipmen
five
midshipmen
stood
in
the
squalid
back
room
of
a
chinese
laundry
in
the
town
of
annapolis
there
was
a
sixth
midshipman
present
in
the
handsome
blue
uniform
of
the
brigade
and
it
was
upon
this
sixth
one
that
the
anger
and
disgust
of
the
other
five
had
centered
he
lay
in
a
sleep
too
deep
for
stirring
on
the
still
foul
air
floated
fumes
that
were
new
to
those
of
his
comrades
who
now
gazed
down
on
him
to
think
that
one
of
our
class
could
make
such
a
beast
of
himself
sighed
dave
darrin
and
on
the
morning
of
the
very
day
we
to
ship
for
the
summer
cruise
uttered
farley
angrily
oh
well
growled
hallam
why
not
let
this
animal
of
lower
grade
sleep
just
where
he
is
let
him
take
what
he
has
fairly
brought
upon
himself
that
the
very
question
that
is
agitating
me
declared
dave
darrin
to
whom
these
other
members
of
the
third
class
looked
as
a
leader
when
there
was
a
point
involving
class
honor
dave
had
became
a
leader
through
suffering
readers
of
the
preceding
volume
in
this
series
dave
darrin
first
year
at
annapolis
will
need
no
introduction
to
this
fine
specimen
of
spirited
and
honorable
young
american
readers
of
that
preceding
volume
will
recall
how
dave
darrin
and
dan
dalzell
entered
the
united
states
naval
academy
one
appointed
by
a
congressman
and
the
other
by
a
united
states
senator
such
readers
will
remember
the
difficult
time
that
dave
and
dan
had
in
getting
through
the
work
of
the
first
hard
grinding
year
they
will
also
recall
how
dave
darrin
when
accused
of
treachery
to
his
classmates
patiently
bided
his
time
until
he
with
the
aid
of
some
close
friends
was
able
to
demonstrate
his
innocence
our
readers
will
also
remember
how
two
members
of
the
then
fourth
class
plotted
to
increase
disgrace
and
to
drive
him
out
of
the
brigade
also
how
these
two
plotters
midshipmen
henkel
and
brimmer
were
caught
in
their
plotting
and
were
themselves
forced
out
of
the
brigade
our
readers
know
that
before
the
end
of
the
first
year
at
the
naval
academy
dave
had
fully
reinstated
himself
in
the
esteem
of
his
manly
classmates
and
how
he
quickly
became
the
most
popular
and
respected
member
of
his
class
it
was
now
only
the
day
after
the
events
whose
narration
closed
the
preceding
volume
dave
darrin
and
dalzell
were
first
of
all
brought
to
notice
in
the
high
school
boys
series
in
their
high
school
days
back
in
gridley
these
two
had
been
famous
members
of
dick
a
sextette
of
youngsters
who
had
made
a
name
for
themselves
in
school
athletics
dick
prescott
and
greg
holmes
two
other
members
of
the
sextette
had
been
appointed
to
the
united
states
military
academy
at
west
point
where
they
were
serving
in
the
corps
of
cadets
and
learning
how
to
become
army
officers
in
the
not
far
distant
future
all
of
the
adventures
of
dick
and
greg
are
set
forth
in
the
west
point
series
the
two
remaining
members
of
famous
old
dick
tom
reade
and
harry
hazelton
became
civil
engineers
and
went
west
for
their
first
taste
of
engineering
work
tom
and
harry
had
some
wonderful
and
startling
adventures
as
fully
set
forth
in
the
young
engineers
series
on
this
early
june
day
when
we
again
encounter
dave
darrin
and
dan
dalzell
in
their
handsome
naval
uniforms
all
members
of
the
first
second
and
third
classes
were
due
to
be
aboard
one
of
the
three
great
battleships
that
lay
off
the
yard
at
annapolis
at
four
these
three
great
battleships
were
the
massachusetts
the
iowa
and
the
indiana
these
three
huge
turreted
fighting
craft
had
their
full
crews
aboard
not
one
of
the
battleship
commanders
would
allow
a
jackie
ashore
except
on
business
through
fear
that
many
of
the
wilder
ones
might
find
the
attractions
on
shore
too
alluring
and
fail
to
return
in
time
with
the
young
midshipmen
it
was
different
these
young
men
were
officially
and
actually
gentlemen
and
could
be
trusted
yet
here
in
the
back
room
of
this
laundry
was
one
who
was
apparently
not
dependable
this
young
midshipman
name
was
pennington
and
the
fact
was
that
he
lay
in
deep
stupor
from
the
effects
of
smoking
opium
it
had
been
a
storekeeper
with
a
shop
across
the
street
who
had
called
the
attention
of
dave
and
his
four
comrades
to
the
probable
fate
of
another
of
their
class
chow
hop
runs
a
laundry
but
i
have
heard
evil
stories
about
a
lot
of
young
fools
who
flock
to
his
back
room
and
get
a
chance
to
the
opium
pipe
the
storekeeper
had
stated
to
dave
one
of
your
men
or
at
least
one
in
a
midshipman
uniform
went
in
there
at
eleven
this
forenoon
and
he
has
been
out
since
it
is
now
nearly
two
and
i
been
looking
for
some
midshipmen
to
inform
such
had
been
the
storekeeper
careful
statement
the
merchants
of
annapolis
always
have
a
kindly
feeling
toward
these
fine
young
midshipmen
the
storekeeper
purpose
was
to
enable
them
to
help
their
comrade
out
so
the
five
had
entered
the
laundry
the
proprietor
chow
hop
had
attempted
to
bar
their
way
to
the
rear
room
but
dave
had
seized
the
yellow
man
and
had
flung
him
aside
the
reader
already
knows
what
they
discovered
and
how
it
affected
these
young
men
bring
that
chink
in
here
if
you
be
so
good
directed
dave
dan
and
hallam
departed
on
the
quest
you
wanted
in
there
proclaimed
dalzell
jerking
a
thumb
over
his
shoulder
me
no
sabby
replied
chow
hop
looking
up
briefly
from
his
ironing
board
get
in
there
do
you
hear
commanded
hallam
gripping
the
other
arm
with
all
his
force
you
lem
me
go
quickly
or
you
get
alle
samee
hurt
you
sabby
scowled
chow
hop
using
his
free
hand
to
raise
a
heavy
menacingly
but
dan
dalzell
jumped
in
giving
the
chinaman
wrist
a
wrench
that
caused
him
to
drop
the
iron
then
without
a
bit
of
ceremony
dan
grasped
the
oriental
by
the
shoulders
wheeled
him
about
while
he
protested
in
guttural
tones
and
bluntly
kicked
the
one
through
the
door
into
the
inner
room
at
this
summary
proceeding
both
the
chinese
helpers
gripped
their
firmly
and
leaped
forward
to
fight
in
an
ugly
temper
the
chinaman
is
a
bad
man
to
oppose
but
now
this
pair
were
faced
by
a
pair
of
quietly
smiling
midshipmen
who
were
also
dangerous
when
angry
you
two
get
back
ordered
dalzell
advancing
fearlessly
upon
the
pair
if
you
do
we
drag
you
out
into
the
street
and
turn
you
over
to
the
policemen
you
that
you
heathen
are
pretty
likely
to
get
into
prison
for
this
day
work
scowling
for
a
moment
then
muttering
savagely
the
two
helpers
slunk
back
to
their
ironing
boards
yet
while
dan
turned
to
go
into
the
rear
room
hallam
stood
just
where
he
was
to
keep
an
eye
on
two
possible
sources
of
swift
trouble
chow
hop
began
dave
damn
sternly
as
the
proprietor
made
his
flying
appearance
you
done
a
pretty
mean
piece
of
work
here
pointing
to
the
unconscious
midshipman
in
the
berth
do
you
understand
that
pretty
likely
to
go
to
prison
for
this
oh
that
no
maller
replied
chow
with
a
sullen
grin
him
plenty
come
here
and
smoke
you
lie
hissed
dave
grasping
the
heathen
by
the
collar
and
shaking
him
until
the
latter
teeth
rattled
then
dave
gave
him
a
brief
rest
though
he
still
retained
his
hold
on
the
chinaman
collar
but
the
yellow
man
began
struggling
again
and
dave
repeated
the
shaking
chow
hop
had
kept
his
hands
up
inside
his
wide
sleeves
now
farley
leaped
forward
as
he
shouted
look
out
darry
he
has
a
knife
farley
attempted
to
seize
the
chinaman
wrist
for
the
purpose
of
disarming
the
yellow
man
but
dave
swiftly
threw
the
chinaman
around
out
of
farley
reach
then
with
a
move
dave
knocked
the
knife
from
chow
hop
hand
pick
that
up
and
keep
it
for
a
curio
farley
directed
dave
coolly
in
another
twinkling
darrin
had
run
the
chinaman
up
against
the
wall
smack
biff
thump
with
increasing
force
dave
hard
fist
struck
the
heathen
in
the
face
now
stand
there
and
behave
yourself
admonished
midshipman
dave
dropping
his
hold
on
the
yellow
man
collar
or
we
stop
playing
with
you
and
hurt
you
some
the
scowl
on
chow
hop
face
was
ominous
but
he
stood
still
glaring
at
dave
chow
what
can
we
do
to
bring
this
man
out
of
his
sleep
asked
dave
coolly
and
almost
in
a
friendly
tone
me
no
sabby
sulked
the
chinaman
yes

do
retorted
dave
warningly
now
what
can
we
do
to
get
our
friend
out
of
this
you
allee
same
cally
carry
him
out
retorted
chow
with
a
suspicion
of
a
sulky
grin
none
of
that
now
you
glared
dave
how
shall
we
get
our
comrade
out
of
this
opium
sleep
me
no
sabby
no
way
insisted
chow
oh
yes

do
snapped
dave
but
you
wo
tell
all
right
find
the
way
and
we
punish
you
into
the
bargain
dan
get
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
other
room
dalzell
was
quickly
back
with
the
desired
item
on
the
paper
dave
wrote
a
name
and
a
telephone
number
it
near
the
end
of
the
doctor
office
hours
murmured
dave
go
to
a
telephone
and
ask
the
doctor
to
meet
you
at
the
corner
above
tell
him
it
vastly
important
and
ask
him
to
meet
you
on
the
jump
shall
i
tell
him
what
up
asked
dan
cautiously
yes
you
better
then
he
be
sure
to
bring
the
necessary
remedies
with
him
dan
dalzell
was
off
like
a
shot
chow
tried
to
edge
around
toward
the
door
here
you
get
back
there
cried
dave
seizing
the
chinaman
and
slamming
him
back
against
the
wall
do
you
move
again
until
we
tell
you
that
you
may
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
ten
minutes
passed
ere
dan
returned
with
lawrence
you
see
the
job
that
cut
out
for
you
said
darrin
pointing
to
the
unconscious
figure
in
the
bunk
can
you
do
it
doctor
the
medical
man
made
a
hasty
examination
of
the
unconscious
midshipman
before
he
answered
briefly
yes
will
it
be
a
long
job
doctor
fifteen
minutes
probably
oh
good
if
you
can
do
it
in
that
time
me
go
now
asked
chow
with
sullen
curiosity
as
the
medical
man
opened
his
yes
if
you
do
try
to
leave
the
joint
agreed
dave
and
i
going
outside
with
you
chow
looked
very
much
as
though
he
did
not
care
for
company
but
midshipman
darrin
kept
at
his
side
now
see
here
chow
warned
dave
this
is
the
last
day
you
sell
opium
for
white
men
to
smoke
you
heap
too
flesh
fresh
growled
the
chinaman
it
the
last
day
you
sell
opium
to
white
men
insisted
dave
for
as
soon
as
i
through
here
i
going
to
the
police
station
to
inform
against
you
they
go
through
here
like
a
shot
you
alle
same
tell
cop
grinned
chow
green
hatred
showing
through
his
skin
then
i
tell
evelybody
about
you
fliend
in
there
do
just
as
you
please
about
that
retorted
dave
with
pretended
carelessness
for
one
thing
you
do
know
his
name
oh
yes
i
do
swaggered
chow
impudently
know
heap
him
his
name
alle
same
seizing
a
marking
brush
and
a
piece
of
paper
chow
hop
quickly
wrote
out
pennington
name
correctly
spelled
his
ability
to
write
english
with
a
good
hand
was
one
of
chow
great
vanities
anyway
you
go
back
to
your
ironing
board
warned
darrin
and
something
in
the
young
third
classman
face
showed
chow
that
it
would
be
wise
to
obey
then
hallam
drew
darrin
to
one
side
to
whisper
earnestly
in
his
ear
look
out
old
man
or
you
will
get
pen
into
an
awful
scrape
i
sha
do
it
maintained
darrin
if
it
happens
it
will
have
been
pen
own
work
you
better
let
the
chink
go
just
to
save
one
of
our
class
is
a
fellow
who
has
turned
opium
fiend
worth
saving
to
the
class
demanded
dave
looking
straight
into
hallam
eyes
well
er
er
stammered
the
other
man
you
see
smiled
dave
the
doubt
hits
you
just
as
hard
as
it
does
me
oh
of
course
a
fellow
who
has
turned
opium
fiend
is
no
fellow
ever
to
be
allowed
to
reach
the
bridge
and
the
admitted
hallam
but
see
here
are
you
going
to
report
this
affair
to
the
commandant
of
midshipmen
or
to
anyone
else
in
authority
i
no
occasion
to
report
replied
dave
dryly
i
am
not
in
any
way
in
command
over
pennington
but
i
mean
to
persuade
him
to
report
himself
for
what
he
has
done
but
that
would
ruin
him
protested
hallam
aghast
he
would
even
be
allowed
to
start
on
the
cruise
he
be
railroaded
home
without
loss
of
a
moment
yet
you
just
said
that
an
is
fit
to
go
on
in
the
brigade
retorted
darrin
hang
it
it
hard
to
know
what
to
do
rejoined
hallam
wrinkling
his
forehead
of
course
we
want
to
be
just
to
pen
it
does
strike
me
as
being
just
exactly
a
question
of
justice
to
pennington
darrin
went
on
earnestly
if
this
is
anything
it
a
question
of
midshipman
honor
we
fellows
are
bound
to
see
that
all
the
unworthy
ones
are
dropped
from
the
service
now
a
fellow
who
has
fastened
the
opium
habit
on
himself
is
fit
to
go
on
is
he
oh
say
but
this
is
a
hard
one
to
settle
groaned
hallam
then
i
take
all
the
responsibility
upon
myself
said
dave
promptly
i
do
want
to
make
any
mistake
and
i
do
believe
i
going
to
wait
just
a
moment
going
to
the
rear
room
dave
faced
his
three
comrades
there
with
the
question
you
three
are
enough
to
take
care
of
everything
here
for
a
few
minutes
are
you
yes
nodded
dan
what
up
hallam
and
i
are
going
for
a
brief
walk
then
stepping
back
into
the
front
room
darrin
nodded
to
his
classmate
who
followed
him
outside
just
come
along
and
say
nothing
about
the
matter
on
the
street
requested
dave
it
might
be
overheard
where
are
you
going
questioned
hallam
wonderingly
wait
and
see
please
from
chow
hop
wretched
establishment
it
was
not
far
to
the
other
building
that
dave
had
in
mind
as
a
destination
but
when
they
arrived
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
hallam
clutched
darrin
arm
holding
him
back
why
see
here
this
is
the
police
station
i
know
it
dave
replied
calmly
but
see
here
you
not
i
not
going
to
drag
you
into
anything
that
you
object
to
darrin
continued
come
along
all
i
want
you
for
is
as
a
witness
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
do
do
it
old
fel
i
thought
that
over
and
i
feel
that
i
must
replied
dave
firmly
come
along
do
attract
attention
by
standing
here
arguing
in
another
instant
the
two
midshipmen
were
going
swiftly
up
the
steps
the
chief
of
police
received
his
two
callers
courteously
dave
told
the
official
how
their
attention
had
been
called
to
the
fact
that
one
of
their
number
was
in
an
opium
joint
dave
named
the
place
but
requested
the
chief
to
wait
a
full
hour
before
taking
any
action
that
will
give
us
a
chance
to
get
out
a
comrade
who
may
have
committed
only
his
first
offense
dave
continued
if
there
any
opium
being
smoked
in
that
place
i
surely
close
the
joint
out
replied
the
chief
bringing
his
fist
down
upon
his
desk
but
i
understand
your
reasons
darrin
is
my
name
sir
replied
dave
quietly
so
darrin
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
wo
even
start
my
investigations
before
this
evening
and
i
keep
all
quiet
about
the
midshipman
end
of
it
thank
you
very
much
sir
said
dave
gratefully
as
the
two
midshipmen
strolled
slowly
back
in
the
direction
of
chow
hop
dave
murmured
now
you
see
why
i
took
this
step
i
afraid
not
very
clearly
replied
midshipman
hallam
that
scoundrelly
chow
made
his
boast
that
other
midshipmen
patronized
his
place
i
do
believe
it
such
a
vice
would
appeal
to
you
and
it
does
to
me
but
there
are
more
than
two
hundred
new
plebes
coming
in
just
now
and
many
of
these
boys
have
never
been
away
from
home
before
some
of
them
might
foolishly
seek
the
lure
of
a
new
vice
and
might
find
the
habit
fastened
on
them
before
they
were
aware
of
it
chow
vile
den
might
spoil
some
good
material
for
the
and
as
a
matter
of
midshipman
honor
we
bound
to
see
that
the
place
is
cleaned
out
right
away
i
guess
darry
you
come
pretty
near
being
right
assented
hallam
after
thinking
for
a
few
moments
by
the
time
they
reached
chow
hop
again
they
found
that
lawrence
had
brought
the
unfortunate
pennington
to
and
a
very
scared
and
humiliated
midshipman
it
was
who
now
stood
up
a
bit
unsteadily
and
tried
to
smooth
down
his
uniform
how
do
you
feel
now
asked
dave
awful
shuddered
pennington
and
now
see
here
what
are
you
fellows
going
to
do
blab
and
see
me
driven
out
of
the
navy
do
do
any
talking
in
here
advised
dave
with
a
meaning
look
over
his
shoulder
at
the
yellow
men
in
the
outer
room
doctor
is
our
friend
in
shape
to
walk
along
with
us
now
he
will
be
in
two
or
three
minutes
after
he
drinks
something
going
to
give
him
replied
the
medical
man
shaking
a
few
drops
from
each
of
three
vials
into
a
glass
of
water
here
young
man
drink
this
slowly
three
minutes
later
the
midshipmen
left
the
place
dave
walking
beside
pennington
and
holding
his
arm
lightly
for
the
purpose
of
steadying
him
how
did
this
happen
pen
queried
dave
when
the
six
men
of
the
third
class
at
last
found
themselves
walking
down
maryland
avenue
how
long
have
you
been
at
this
trick
never
before
replied
midshipman
pennington
quickly
pen
will
you
tell
me
that
on
your
honor
asked
dave
gravely
the
other
midshipman
flared
up
why
must
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
he
demanded
defiantly
is
my
plain
word
good
enough
your
word
of
honor
that
you
had
never
smoked
opium
before
would
help
to
ease
my
mind
a
whole
lot
replied
darrin
come
unburden
yourself
wo
you
pen
i
tell
you
darry
just
how
it
happened
the
first
time
on
my
word
of
honor
i
came
out
into
annapolis
with
a
raging
toothache
now
you
know
how
a
fellow
gets
to
hate
to
go
before
the
medical
officers
of
the
academy
with
a
tale
about
his
teeth
yes
i
do
nodded
darrin
if
a
fellow
is
too
much
on
the
medical
report
for
trouble
with
his
teeth
then
it
makes
the
surgeons
look
his
mouth
over
with
all
the
more
caution
and
in
the
end
a
fellow
may
get
dropped
from
the
brigade
just
because
he
has
invited
over
zeal
from
the
dentist
but
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
opium
smoking
just
this
replied
pennington
hanging
his
head
i
went
into
a
drug
store
and
asked
a
clerk
that
i
know
what
was
the
best
thing
for
toothache
he
told
me
the
best
he
knew
was
to
smoke
a
pipe
of
opium
and
told
me
where
to
find
chow
hop
and
what
to
say
to
the
chink
and
all
a
lie
about
opium
helping
a
sore
tooth
cried
the
wretched
midshipman
clapping
a
hand
to
his
jaw
for
there
goes
that
fiendish
tooth
again
but
say
you
fellows
are
not
going
to
leak
about
my
little
mishap
no
replied
darrin
with
great
promptness
you
going
to
do
that
yourself
what
gasped
midshipman
pennington
in
intense
astonishment
what
are
you
talking
about
you
be
wise
to
turn
in
a
report
on
what
happened
pursued
dave
for
it
likely
to
reach
official
ears
anyway
and
you
be
better
off
if
you
make
the
first
report
on
the
subject
why
is
it
likely
to
reach
official
ears
if
you
fellows
keep
your
mouths
shut
you
see
darrin
went
on
very
quietly
i
reported
the
joint
at
the
police
station
and
chow
hop
threatened
that
if
i
did
he
tell
all
he
knew
about
everybody
so
you
better
be
first
you
broke
the
game
out
to
the
police
gasped
pennington
staring
dumfoundedly
at
his
comrade
what
on
earth
i
did
it
because
i
had
more
than
one
satisfactory
reason
for
considering
it
my
duty
interposed
dave
speaking
quietly
though
firmly
you
you
bag
of
wind
exploded
midshipman
pennington
i
accept
your
apology
when
you
had
time
to
think
it
all
over
replied
dave
with
a
smile
though
there
was
a
brief
flash
in
his
eyes
i
make
no
apology
to
you
at
any
time
you
you
greaser
marks
for
efficiency
or
good
conduct
which
increase
a
standing
are
called
or
grease
in
midshipman
slang
hence
a
midshipman
who
is
accused
of
currying
favor
with
his
officers
in
order
to
win
grease
is
contemptuously
termed
a
greaser
i
do
want
to
talk
with
you
any
more
darrin
pennington
went
on
bitterly
or
walk
with
you
either
when
i
get
over
this
toothache
call
you
out
you
greaser
burning
with
indignation
midshipman
pennington
fell
back
to
walk
with
hallam
chapter
ii
dave
advice
when
our
party
reached
the
landing
a
lively
scene
lay
before
them
fully
a
hundred
midshipmen
belonging
to
the
first
second
and
third
classes
were
waiting
to
be
transported
out
to
one
or
another
of
the
great
gray
battleships
several
launches
were
darting
back
and
forth
over
the
water
the
baggage
of
the
midshipmen
had
already
been
taken
aboard
the
battleships
only
the
young
men
themselves
were
now
awaited
stood
a
lieutenant
of
the
navy
who
was
directing
the
embarkation
of
the
midshipmen
of
the
different
classes
five
minutes
after
our
party
arrived
a
launch
from
the
massachusetts
lay
in
alongside
the
landing
third
classmen
this
way
shouted
the
lieutenant
how
many
of
you
turning
his
eyes
over
the
squad
that
had
moved
forward
the
officer
continued
you
can
all
crowd
into
this
launch
move
quickly
young
gentlemen
in
another
couple
of
minutes
the
puffing
launch
was
steaming
away
to
the
massive
battleship
that
lay
out
in
the
stream
dave
stood
well
up
in
the
bow
once
he
barely
overheard
pennington
mutter
to
a
comrade
the
rascally
greaser
that
means
me
dave
muttered
under
his
breath
i
wo
take
it
up
now
or
in
any
hurry
i
wait
until
pen
has
had
time
to
see
things
straight
as
soon
as
the
launch
lay
alongside
the
young
midshipmen
clambered
nimbly
up
the
side
gangway
each
raising
his
cap
to
the
flag
at
the
stern
as
he
passed
through
the
opening
in
the
rail
here
stood
an
officer
with
an
open
book
in
his
hand
to
him
each
midshipman
reported
saluting
stated
his
name
and
received
his
berthing
hurry
away
to
find
your
berthings
and
get
acquainted
with
the
location
ordered
this
officer
every
midshipman
will
report
on
the
promptly
at
five
in
the
meantime
after
locating
your
berthings
you
are
at
liberty
to
range
over
the
ship
avoiding
the
ward
room
and
the
staterooms
of
officers
the
latest
arrivals
saluted
then
under
the
guidance
of
messengers
chosen
from
among
the
apprentice
members
of
the
crew
the
young
men
located
their
berthings
i
going
to
get
mine
changed
if
i
can
growled
pennington
wheeling
upon
dave
darrin
i
much
too
close
to
a
greaser
i
afraid
i
may
get
my
uniforms
spotted
as
well
as
my
character
stop
that
pen
warned
dave
stationing
himself
squarely
before
the
angry
pennington
i
do
know
just
how
far
you
responsible
for
what
you
saying
now
if
you
make
any
such
remarks
to
me
have
to
pay
a
mighty
big
penalty
for
them
you
make
me
pay
by
going
to
the
commandant
and
telling
him
all
you
know
i
suppose
sneered
pennington
you
know
better
pen
now
begin
to
practise
keeping
a
civil
tongue
behind
your
teeth
with
that
darrin
turned
on
his
heel
seeking
the
deck
this
left
pen
to
conjecture
as
to
whether
he
should
report
his
misadventure
and
if
so
how
best
to
go
about
it
see
here
hallam
began
the
worried
midshipman
i
begin
to
feel
that
it
will
be
safer
to
turn
in
some
kind
of
report
on
myself
much
safer
agreed
hallam
it
will
show
good
faith
on
your
part
if
you
report
yourself
and
get
me
broken
from
the
service
too
i
suppose
growled
the
unhappy
one
i
hardly
think
it
will
if
you
report
yourself
first
urged
hallam
but
you
be
about
certain
to
get
your
walking
papers
if
you
wait
for
the
first
information
to
come
from
other
sources
hang
it
groaned
pennington
i
wish
i
could
think
but
my
head
aches
as
though
it
would
split
and
my
tooth
is
putting
up
more
trouble
than
i
ever
knew
there
was
in
the
world
and
in
this
racked
condition
i
to
go
and
put
myself
on
the
in
what
way
shall
i
do
it
hallam
ca
you
suggest
something
yes
retorted
hallam
with
great
energy
go
to
the
medical
officer
and
tell
him
how
your
tooth
troubles
you
tell
him
what
you
tried
on
shore
i
go
with
you
if
you
want
will
you
old
man
i
be
a
thousand
times
obliged
so
the
pair
went
off
in
search
of
the
as
the
hospital
part
of
a
battleship
is
called
the
surgeon
was
not
in
his
office
adjoining
but
the
hospital
steward
called
him
over
one
of
the
ship
telephones
informing
him
that
a
midshipman
was
suffering
with
an
ulcerated
tooth
mackenzie
came
at
once
turned
on
a
reflector
light
and
gazed
into
midshipman
pennington
mouth
have
you
tried
to
treat
this
tooth
yourself
in
any
way
queried
the
ship
surgeon
yes
sir
i
was
so
crazy
with
the
pain
while
in
annapolis
that
i
am
afraid
i
did
something
that
will
get
me
into
trouble
replied
pennington
with
a
quiver
in
his
voice
what
was
that
asked
mackenzie
glancing
at
him
sharply
did
you
try
the
aid
of
liquor
worse
i
afraid
sir
worse
pennington
told
of
his
experience
with
the
opium
pipe
that
no
good
whatever
for
a
toothache
sir
growled
mackenzie
besides
it
a
serious
breach
of
discipline
i
shall
have
to
report
you
mr
pennington
i
expected
it
sir
replied
pennington
meekly
however
the
report
wo
cure
your
toothache
continued
mackenzie
in
a
milder
tone
we
attend
to
that
first
the
surgeon
busied
himself
with
dissolving
a
drug
in
a
small
quantity
of
water
this
he
took
up
in
a
hypodermic
needle
and
injected
into
the
lower
jaw
the
ache
ought
to
stop
in
ten
minutes
sir
continued
the
surgeon
turning
to
enter
some
memoranda
in
his
record
book
after
that
the
surgeon
called
up
the
ship
commander
over
the
and
made
known
pennington
report
pennington
captain
scott
directs
that
you
report
at
his
office
immediately
said
the
surgeon
as
he
turned
away
from
the
telephone
very
good
sir
thank
you
sir
both
midshipmen
saluted
then
left
the
this
is
where
you
have
to
go
up
alone
i
guess
hinted
midshipman
hallam
i
afraid
so
sighed
pennington
however
i
be
on
the
and
if
i
wanted
you
can
send
there
for
me
thank
you
old
man
you
worth
a
brigade
of
darrins
confound
the
greasing
meddler
darrin
acted
according
to
his
best
lights
on
the
subject
of
duty
remonstrated
hallam
mildly
his
best
lights
bah
snarled
pennington
i
take
this
all
out
of
him
before
i
through
with
him
pennington
reported
to
the
battleship
commander
after
some
ten
minutes
a
marine
orderly
found
hallam
and
directed
him
to
go
to
captain
scott
office
here
hallam
repeated
as
much
as
was
asked
of
him
concerning
the
doings
of
the
afternoon
incidentally
the
fact
of
midshipman
darrin
report
to
the
police
was
brought
out
pennington
i
shall
send
you
at
once
in
a
launch
over
to
the
commandant
of
cadets
to
report
this
matter
in
person
to
him
said
captain
scott
gravely
hallam
you
will
go
with
mr
pennington
then
after
the
two
had
departed
an
apprentice
messenger
went
through
the
ship
calling
dave
name
that
young
man
was
summoned
to
captain
scott
office
i
am
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
relating
to
the
unfortunate
affair
of
midshipman
pennington
darrin
began
captain
scott
after
the
interchange
of
salutes
will
you
tell
me
why
you
reported
the
affair
to
the
police
i
went
to
the
police
sir
dave
replied
because
i
was
aware
that
many
members
of
the
new
fourth
class
are
away
from
home
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
i
was
afraid
sir
that
possibly
some
of
the
new
midshipmen
might
during
one
of
their
be
tempted
to
try
for
a
new
experience
a
very
excellent
reason
darrin
and
i
commend
you
heartily
for
it
i
shall
also
report
your
exemplary
conduct
to
the
commandant
of
midshipmen
you
have
in
my
opinion
darrin
displayed
very
good
judgment
and
you
acted
upon
that
judgment
with
promptness
and
decision
but
i
am
afraid
continued
the
navy
captain
dryly
that
you
have
done
something
that
will
make
you
highly
unpopular
for
a
while
with
some
of
the
members
of
your
class
i
hope
not
sir
replied
dave
so
do
i
smiled
captain
scott
i
am
willing
to
find
myself
a
poor
prophet
that
is
all
mr
darrin
once
more
saluting
dave
left
the
commanding
officer
presence
almost
the
first
classmate
into
whom
he
stumbled
was
dan
dalzell
well
from
what
quarter
does
the
wind
blow
murmured
dan
darrin
repeated
the
interview
that
he
had
just
had
i
afraid
dave
little
giant
that
you
planted
something
of
a
mine
under
yourself
murmured
dalzell
i
feel
as
much
convinced
as
ever
danny
boy
that
i
did
just
what
i
should
have
done
replied
darrin
seriously
and
so
does
captain
scott
and
so
will
the
commandant
replied
dan
but
winning
the
commendation
of
your
superior
officers
does
always
imply
that
you
get
much
praise
from
your
classmates
unfortunately
you
are
quite
right
smiled
dave
still
i
do
the
same
thing
over
again
oh
of
course
you
would
assented
dan
that
because
you
dave
darrin
here
a
voice
like
a
bass
horn
was
heard
all
third
classmen
report
to
the
immediately
this
order
was
repeated
in
other
parts
of
the
ship
midshipmen
gathered
with
a
rush
pennington
and
hallam
being
the
only
members
absent
as
soon
as
the
third
classmen
or
youngsters
as
they
are
called
in
midshipman
parlance
had
formed
the
orders
were
read
off
dividing
them
into
sections
for
practical
instruction
aboard
ship
during
the
cruise
dave
name
was
one
of
the
first
read
off
he
was
assigned
to
duty
as
section
leader
for
the
first
section
in
electrical
instruction
dalzell
farley
hallam
pennington
and
others
were
detailed
as
members
of
that
section
the
same
section
was
also
designated
for
steam
instruction
dalzell
being
made
leader
of
the
section
in
this
branch
the
class
was
then
dismissed
somewhat
later
pennington
and
hallam
returned
from
their
interview
with
the
commandant
hallam
at
once
sought
out
dave
darry
old
man
murmured
hallam
pen
is
as
crazy
as
a
hornet
against
you
as
he
had
taken
the
first
step
by
sticking
himself
on
the
placing
himself
on
report
the
commandant
said
he
would
make
the
punishment
a
lighter
one
what
did
pen
get
queried
dave
fifty
demerits
with
all
the
loss
of
privileges
that
fifty
carry
he
lucky
declared
dave
promptly
had
the
report
come
from
other
sources
he
would
have
been
dismissed
from
the
service
if
pen
lucky
rejoined
hallam
he
does
seem
to
realize
the
fact
he
calling
you
about
everything
he
can
keep
that
up
flashed
dave
until
his
toothache
leaves
him
then
if
he
tries
to
carry
it
any
further
pen
will
collide
with
one
of
my
fists
not
much
later
a
call
sounded
summoning
the
youngsters
to
the
midshipmen
mess
dave
was
glad
to
note
that
pennington
sat
at
some
distance
from
him
at
table
while
the
meal
was
in
progress
the
massachusetts
and
the
other
battleships
got
under
way
the
midshipmen
were
on
deck
an
hour
later
when
the
fleet
came
to
anchor
for
the
night
some
miles
down
chesapeake
bay
before
the
youngsters
were
ordered
to
their
berths
that
night
third
classman
pennington
had
found
opportunity
to
do
a
good
deal
of
talking
to
a
few
comrades
who
would
listen
to
him
pennington
was
determined
to
stir
up
a
hornet
nest
for
dave
darrin
chapter
iii
midshipman
pennington
goes
too
far
at
eight
the
following
morning
the
various
sections
were
formed
and
marched
to
the
deck
dave
reported
all
present
sir
the
chief
electrician
was
now
summoned
and
to
him
the
section
was
turned
over
this
young
man
whittam
by
name
was
an
enlisted
man
but
a
bright
young
sample
of
what
the
navy
can
do
for
the
boy
who
enlists
as
an
apprentice
you
will
take
your
orders
from
whittam
as
though
he
were
an
officer
directed
the
officer
his
words
intended
for
all
members
of
the
section
though
he
looked
only
at
darrin
dave
saluted
then
as
chief
electrician
whittam
turned
to
lead
the
way
dave
called
quietly
section
left
wheel
march
they
followed
whittam
down
into
the
dynamo
room
an
interesting
spot
for
a
machinist
it
fine
muttered
dan
as
he
stared
about
him
at
the
bright
metal
work
the
and
the
revolving
machines
but
i
afraid
i
could
learn
the
use
and
sense
of
all
this
in
five
years
silence
in
the
section
commanded
dave
turning
around
upon
his
chum
whittam
now
began
a
short
preliminary
talk
upon
the
subjects
in
which
the
midshipmen
would
be
required
to
qualify
one
of
the
first
and
most
important
requests
i
have
to
make
said
whittam
presently
is
that
none
of
you
touch
the
switches
except
by
direction
none
of
you
can
guess
the
harm
that
might
follow
the
careless
and
ignorant
handling
of
a
switch
it
pretty
cheeky
for
an
enlisted
man
to
talk
to
midshipmen
about
ignorance
whispered
pennington
to
farley
oh
i
do
know
farley
started
to
reply
but
darrin
quiet
voice
broke
in
with
authority
cease
talking
in
section
farley
knew
this
to
be
a
merited
rebuke
and
accepted
it
as
such
but
pennington
face
went
violently
red
confound
that
growled
pen
he
be
bound
to
take
it
out
of
me
as
long
as
the
cruise
lasts
but
i
get
even
with
him
no
cheap
greaser
is
going
to
ride
over
me
that
morning
none
of
the
midshipmen
were
called
upon
to
handle
any
of
the
machinery
nearly
the
whole
of
this
tour
of
practical
instruction
was
taken
up
by
the
remarks
of
the
chief
electrician
as
he
spoke
whittam
moved
over
to
one
piece
or
another
of
mechanism
and
explained
its
uses
finally
he
began
to
question
the
attentive
young
men
to
see
how
much
of
his
instruction
they
had
absorbed
this
is
a
shame
to
set
an
enlisted
man
up
over
us
as
just
to
see
how
little
we
know
growled
pennington
but
this
time
he
had
the
good
sense
not
to
address
his
remark
to
anyone
pennington
was
not
yet
in
good
shape
after
his
harrowing
experiences
of
the
day
before
ere
the
tour
of
instruction
was
over
he
began
to
shift
somewhat
uneasily
then
his
attention
began
to
wander
a
brilliantly
shining
brass
rod
near
him
caught
his
eye
something
about
the
glossy
metal
fascinated
him
once
or
twice
pen
put
out
his
hand
to
touch
the
rod
but
as
quickly
reconsidered
and
drew
back
his
hand
at
last
however
the
temptation
proved
too
strong
he
slid
one
hand
along
the
rail
here
sir
do
handle
that
rasped
in
the
voice
of
whittam
pennington
drew
back
his
hand
a
flush
mounting
to
his
face
the
fellow
has
no
right
to
talk
to
a
midshipman
in
that
fashion
quivered
pennington
to
himself
but
it
was
the
fault
of
that
greaser
darrin
anyway
darrin
saw
me
and
he
glanced
swiftly
at
the
chief
electrician
to
draw
attention
to
me
it
is
only
just
to
pennington
to
state
that
he
actually
believed
he
had
seen
dave
do
this
darrin
however
was
not
guilty
of
the
act
he
had
in
no
way
sought
to
direct
attention
at
pennington
towards
the
close
of
the
tour
the
officer
in
whose
department
this
instruction
fell
passed
through
the
dynamo
room
are
there
any
breaches
of
conduct
to
be
reported
whittam
inquired
the
officer
halting
nothing
worth
mentioning
sir
replied
the
chief
electrician
i
asked
you
whittam
whether
there
had
been
any
breaches
of
conduct
retorted
the
officer
with
some
asperity
one
midshipman
sir
after
having
been
instructed
to
touch
nothing
rested
his
hand
on
one
of
the
brass
rods
his
name
i
do
know
the
names
of
many
of
the
young
gentlemen
yet
sir
so
i
do
know
the
particular
midshipman
name
sir
then
point
him
out
to
me
insisted
the
officer
there
was
hardly
any
need
to
do
so
pennington
face
flushed
with
mortification
was
sufficient
identification
but
the
chief
electrician
stepped
over
halting
in
front
of
the
hapless
one
and
said
this
is
the
young
gentleman
sir
your
name
sir
demanded
the
officer
pennington
sir
pennington
you
will
place
yourself
on
the
report
sir
for
disobedience
of
orders
commanded
the
officer
is
this
the
only
case
whittam
the
only
case
sir
the
officer
passed
out
of
the
dynamo
room
leaving
the
unlucky
one
more
than
ever
angry
with
darrin
whom
he
incorrectly
charged
with
his
present
trouble
the
recall
sounding
dave
turned
to
whittam
saying
crisply
but
pleasantly
thank
you
for
our
instruction
he
thanking
the
fellow
for
my
new
scrape
growled
pennington
inwardly
dave
marched
his
section
back
to
deck
and
dismissed
it
dan
dalzell
as
section
leader
in
steam
instruction
immediately
it
you
will
report
in
the
dalzell

a
strange

your

inquired
the

dalzell
sir
let
your

break
ranks
then
you
may

and
keep

or
two
dark
places
aye
aye
sir
section
break
ranks
forman
led
the
way
with
all
the
members
of
the
section
wondering
what
was
to
be
the
nature
of
their
first
day
work
in
the
engineer
department
descending
lower
into
the
ship
the
chief
engineer
led
the
young
middies
over
a
grating
and
paused
at
the
head
of
an
iron
ladder
pass
down
in
orderly
fashion
single
file
directed
the
chief
engineer
halting
when
at
the
foot
of
this
ladder
cross
a
grating
to
port
side
and
then
descend
a
second
ladder
which
you
will
find
all
the
midshipmen
went
down
the
first
ladder
in
silence
dan
who
had
preceded
the
others
crossed
the
grating
and
found
the
second
ladder
once
more
these
youngsters
descended
pennington
as
though
by
mere
accident
succeeded
in
following
dave
darrin
down
the
ladder
just
as
they
were
near
the
bottom
dave
felt
a
foot
descend
upon
his
shoulder
almost
with
a
kick
and
then
rest
there
with
a
crushing
pressure
it
hurt
keenly
until
darrin
was
able
to
dodge
out
from
under
and
hurriedly
reach
the
bottom
pardon
whoever
you
are
came
a
gruff
voice
dave
with
his
shoulder
crippled
a
good
deal
and
paining
keenly
halted
as
soon
as
his
foot
had
touched
bottom
it
was
dark
down
there
though
some
reflected
light
came
from
an
incandescent
light
at
a
distance
dave
waited
to
peer
into
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
stepped
on
his
shoulder
it
was
pennington
of
course
i
take
pains
not
to
go
down
ahead
of
you
again
or
to
follow
you
up
a
ladder
grunted
darrin
suspiciously
oh
are
you
the
man
on
whose
shoulder
my
foot
rested
asked
pennington
with
apparent
curiosity
did
you
know
it
questioned
darrin
looking
straight
into
the
other
eyes
instead
of
answering
intelligibly
pennington
turned
and
walked
away
a
few
feet
perhaps
that
fellow
thinks
he
going
to
vent
his
spite
on
me
in
a
lot
of
petty
ways
murmured
dave
if
that
is
the
idea
he
has
in
his
head
he
going
to
wake
up
one
of
these
days
following
the
last
midshipman
came
forman
after
me
gentlemen
directed
the
chief
engineer
he
turned
down
a
narrow
passage
only
a
few
feet
long
and
came
out
in
the
furnace
room
here
huge
fires
glowed
through
the
furnace
doors
four
of
the
firemen
stood
resting
on
their
shovels
instantly
on
perceiving
the
chief
engineer
however
the
men
stood
at
attention
pass
the
word
for
the
chief
water
tender
ordered
the
engineer
turning
to
one
of
the
firemen
the
messenger
soon
came
back
with
a
stalwart
man
of
forty
heistand
ordered
the
chief
engineer
give
these
members
of
the
first
section
third
class
steam
instruction
a
thorough
drill
in
firing
aye
aye
sir
replied
the
chief
water
tender
saluting
heistand
orders
are
mine
dalzell
continued
the
facing
dan
preserve
order
in
your
section
aye
aye
sir
replied
dan
saluting
acknowledging
this
courtesy
in
kind
the
chief
engineer
turned
and
left
the
furnace
room
heistand
was
presumably
of
german
parentage
though
he
had
no
accent
he
struck
the
midshipmen
as
being
a
pleasant
wholesome
fellow
though
the
water
tenders
and
firemen
of
the
massachusetts
knew
that
he
could
be
extremely
strict
and
grim
at
need
you
will
now
young
gentlemen
began
heistand
proceed
to
learn
all
about
priming
a
furnace
lighting
building
cleaning
and
generally
taking
care
of
a
fire
two
furnaces
have
been
left
idle
for
this
instruction
but
two
of
the
regular
firemen
now
remained
in
the
room
these
were
ordered
to
hustle
out
coal
before
boilers
b
and
then
heistand
taught
the
members
of
the
section
how
to
swing
a
shovel
to
the
best
advantage
so
as
to
get
in
a
maximum
of
coal
with
the
least
effort
he
also
illustrated
two
or
three
incorrect
ways
of
shoveling
coal
the
idea
of
making
coal
heavers
out
of
us
growled
a
voice
dan
did
not
see
who
the
speaker
was
but
his
eyes
flashed
as
he
turned
and
rasped
out
silence
in
the
section
speak
only
to
ask
for
information
and
then
at
the
proper
time
another
young
autocrat
muttered
a
voice
wait
one
moment
please
heistand
begged
dan
then
wheeling
squarely
about
and
facing
all
the
members
of
the
section
he
declared
with
emphasis
if
there
any
more
unauthorized
talking
i
shall
feel
obliged
to
pass
the
word
above
that
discipline
is
in
a
bad
way
in
this
section
then
he
wheeled
about
once
more
facing
the
chief
water
tender
now
young
gentlemen
resumed
the
chief
water
tender
take
your
shovels
and
fill
in
lively
under
boilers
b
and
three
or
four
times
heistand
checked
one
or
another
of
the
midshipmen
to
show
him
a
more
correct
way
of
handling
the
shovel
yet
in
good
time
both
furnaces
were
primed
now
dalzell
please
detail
four
members
of
the
section
to
follow
me
with
their
shovels
and
bring
red
coals
from
under
another
boiler
dan
appointed
himself
darrin
farley
and
pennington
burning
coals
were
brought
and
thrown
into
each
furnace
and
in
a
little
while
roaring
fires
were
going
these
though
not
needed
for
the
handling
of
the
battleship
were
permitted
to
burn
for
a
while
heistand
explaining
to
the
section
practically
the
uses
of
the
water
gauges
and
the
test
cocks
by
this
time
the
midshipmen
white
working
clothes
were
liberally
sprinkled
with
coal
dust
and
somewhat
smeared
with
oils
and
now
young
gentlemen
as
we
have
no
further
use
for
these
fires
you
will
next
learn
how
to
haul
them
announced
heistand
this
was
interesting
work
but
hot
and
fast
the
implements
with
which
the
middies
worked
soon
became
at
the
end
yet
as
all
entered
into
this
novel
work
with
zest
the
fires
had
soon
been
hauled
out
on
to
the
floor
plates
just
as
the
last
of
this
work
was
being
done
pennington
as
an
apparent
accident
due
to
excess
of
zeal
dropped
the
end
of
his
implement
across
the
toe
of
darrin
left
shoe
in
an
instant
the
leather
began
to
blaze
with
swift
presence
of
mind
dave
stepped
his
right
foot
on
the
flame
smothering
it
at
once
but
he
was
mad
clean
through
see
here
pen
he
muttered
in
a
low
voice
his
eyes
blazing
fiercely
into
the
other
midshipman
that
is
the
last
piece
of
impudence
that
will
be
tolerated
from
you
midshipman
pennington
lip
curled
disdainfully
dan
had
not
seen
the
accident
but
he
was
near
enough
to
hear
the
talking
and
he
caught
dave
at
it
so
dan
ordered
impartially
darrin
you
will
place
yourself
on
report
for
unauthorized
talking
in
section
dave
flushed
still
more
hotly
but
said
nothing
midshipman
dalzell
now
marched
the
section
from
the
furnace
room
and
dismissed
it
it
was
near
noon
and
would
soon
be
time
for
the
middies
to
eat
dave
hurried
away
washed
changed
his
uniform
and
then
stepped
away
swiftly
to
place
himself
on
the
report
i
was
sorry
to
do
that
old
chum
murmured
dan
as
he
met
dave
returning
but
of
course
i
could
play
favorites
what
made
you
so
far
forget
yourself
a
something
that
would
have
had
the
same
effect
on
you
retorted
dave
grimly
thereupon
he
described
pennington
two
underhanded
assaults
that
morning
humph
muttered
dalzell
that
fellow
pen
is
bound
to
go
the
whole
limit
with
you
he
wo
go
much
further
declared
dave
his
eyes
flashing
and
the
chump
ought
to
know
it
too
mused
dan
the
class
history
of
the
last
year
should
have
taught
him
that
but
see
here
dave
i
believe
pen
will
do
anything
openly
he
will
construct
a
series
of
plausible
accidents
there
will
be
one
thing
about
him
that
will
be
open
if
he
goes
any
further
retorted
dave
and
that
will
be
his
face
when
he
collides
with
my
fist
i
hope
i
see
that
when
it
happens
grinned
dalzell
it
bound
to
be
entertaining
wait
a
second
then
here
comes
pennington
now
murmured
dave
darrin
in
an
undertone
pennington
in
his
immaculate
blue
uniform
like
the
chums
came
strolling
along
the
passageway
between
decks
he
affected
not
to
see
the
chums
and
would
have
passed
by
but
dave
eyeing
him
closely
waited
until
pen
was
barely
three
feet
away
then
darrin
said
tersely
pennington
i
wish
an
understanding
with
you
i
do
want
any
with
you
replied
pennington
insolently
as
he
stared
at
dave
from
under
eyebrows
he
would
have
gone
by
but
dave
sprang
squarely
in
front
of
him
just
wait
a
moment
warned
dave
rather
imperiously
for
he
was
aglow
with
justifiable
indignation
well
demanded
pennington
halting
out
with
it
whatever
you
may
think
you
have
to
say
i
have
two
things
to
speak
about
replied
dave
trying
to
control
his
voice
in
the
first
place
while
going
down
the
ladders
to
the
furnaces
this
morning
you
stepped
on
my
shoulder
well
insisted
pennington
coldly
the
second
thing
you
did
was
when
hauling
the
fires
to
drop
metal
across
one
of
my
shoes
setting
it
on
fire
well
insisted
pennington
more
coldly
if
you
mean
to
contend
that
either
one
was
an
accident
resumed
dave
then
but
he
found
himself
obliged
to
pause
for
a
moment
in
order
to
steady
his
voice
well
asked
pennington
with
more
insolence
than
ever
if
you
make
such
pretense
in
either
case
tittered
dave
darrin
then
you
a
liar
fellow
sputtered
pennington
turning
white
with
anger
i
mean
what
i
say
and
i
can
back
it
up
muttered
darrin
then
i
make
you
eat
your
words
roared
pennington
clenching
his
fists
and
with
the
boxer
attitude
pen
aimed
two
swift
blows
at
darrin
neither
blow
reached
however
for
dave
dodged
out
of
the
way
then
darrin
struck
back
a
straight
true
forceful
blow
that
landed
on
the
other
midshipman
nose
knocking
him
down
pennington
staggered
somewhat
when
he
rose
but
he
was
quickly
up
none
the
less
and
ready
for
anything
that
might
happen
all
of
a
sudden
dan
dalzell
felt
his
own
heart
going
down
into
his
shoes
one
of
the
ship
officers
had
just
entered
the
passageway
in
time
to
see
what
was
going
on
chapter
iv
a
little
meeting
ashore
stop
it
both
of
you
whispered
dan
stand
at
attention
ready
to
salute
the
officer
pennington
with
the
blood
flowing
from
his
damaged
nose
would
have
made
a
most
ludicrous
figure
saluting
the
instant
that
he
saw
such
evidence
as
pen
nose
presented
the
officer
would
be
bound
to
make
inquiries
then
just
as
surely
his
next
step
must
be
to
border
the
three
before
the
commandant
of
midshipmen
fighting
carries
with
it
a
severe
penalty
even
dan
was
certain
to
be
reported
through
the
mere
fact
of
his
presence
there
as
aiding
in
a
fight
and
those
who
aid
are
punished
as
severely
as
the
principals
themselves
it
was
a
tense
fearsome
instant
for
midshipmen
have
been
dismissed
from
the
naval
academy
for
this
very
offense
the
passage
was
not
brilliantly
lighted
the
officer
a
lieutenant
junior
grade
was
looking
at
the
floor
as
he
came
along
suddenly
he
paused
seemed
lost
in
thought
then
wheeled
and
walked
back
whence
he
had
come
dan
breathed
more
easily
dave
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
as
for
pennington
that
midshipman
had
wheeled
and
was
stealing
rapidly
down
the
passageway
intent
only
on
escape
that
was
the
closest
squeak
we
ever
have
without
being
ragged
cold
murmured
dalzell
tremulously
where
is
pennington
demanded
dave
wheeling
about
after
he
had
watched
the
naval
lieutenant
out
of
sight
ducked
out
of
sight
like
a
submarine
chuckled
dan
at
that
moment
the
call
for
midshipmen
dinner
formation
sounded
dave
and
dan
were
ready
pennington
showed
up
just
after
the
line
had
started
to
march
into
the
midshipmen
mess
tables
to
the
inquiry
of
the
officer
in
charge
pen
lamely
explained
that
he
had
bumped
his
nose
into
something
hard
in
a
poorly
lighted
passageway
though
the
officer
accepted
the
excuse
he
smiled
within
himself
it
was
iron
or
steel
that
bumped
that
young
man
nose
thought
the
officer
oh
the
middies
have
changed
a
lot
since
i
boned
at
annapolis
pennington
nose
was
no
very
lovely
member
of
his
face
at
that
moment
it
had
been
struck
hard
mashed
rather
flat
and
now
looked
like
a
red
bulb
meet
with
an
accident
pen
asked
hallam
curiously
at
table
quit
your
kidding
please
requested
pennington
sulkily
that
directed
the
curious
glances
of
other
middies
at
pennington
new
bulbous
nose
the
young
man
was
so
brusque
about
it
however
that
other
table
mates
ceased
quizzing
him
yet
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
many
a
youngster
asked
others
of
his
class
for
news
regarding
pen
but
none
possessed
it
during
the
brief
rest
that
followed
the
meal
however
midshipman
pennington
made
it
his
business
to
try
to
meet
dave
darrin
alone
he
succeeded
finding
dave
staring
off
across
the
water
at
the
port
rail
of
course
darrin
began
the
other
midshipman
in
a
voice
suggestive
of
ice
you
are
aware
that
the
incident
of
an
hour
ago
can
not
be
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
i
do
believe
there
any
danger
of
that
retorted
darrin
with
an
ironical
glance
at
pennington
nose
confound
you
sir
hissed
the
other
midshipman
do
you
dare
to
be
insolent
with
me
why
i
had
thought
observed
dave
that
of
your
own
choice
the
period
of
courtesies
between
us
had
passed
i
shall
call
you
out
mr
darrin
you
find
my
hearing
excellent
smiled
dave
i
shall
make
but
one
stipulation
i
do
you
the
favor
of
asking
what
that
stipulation
is
sneered
pennington
why
after
the
narrow
escape
we
had
from
being
caught
and
reported
an
hour
or
so
ago
i
shall
ask
that
the
fight
be
held
where
we
are
not
so
likely
to
be
caught
at
it
i
do
care
about
being
dropped
from
the
naval
academy
nor
do
i
believe
you
do
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
service
if
one
of
us
were
to
be
dropped
sneered
pennington
yes
oh
well
you
can
easily
procure
writing
materials
from
the
captain
clerk
volunteered
dave
generously
on
a
cruise
i
believe
a
resignation
is
sent
direct
to
the
commandant
of
midshipmen
this
ridicule
served
only
to
fan
the
flame
of
pennington
wrath
darrin
he
hissed
the
academy
is
big
enough
to
hold
us
both
but
i
already
told
you
how
to
get
out
protested
dave
coolly
i
do
intend
to
get
out
no
more
do
i
rejoined
dave
i
wo
even
toss
pennies
with
you
to
find
out
who
quits
the
service
darrin
you
are
merely
seeking
to
divert
my
mind
from
what
i
have
said
what
did
you
say
particularly
that
you
would
have
to
fight
me
i
have
already
signified
my
entire
willingness
pennington
to
that
i
really
can
add
nothing
fourth
classmen
are
always
addressed
as
mister
and
they
must
use
the
same
handle
to
the
name
when
addressing
upper
classmen
but
members
of
the
three
upper
classes
resort
to
the
use
of
mister
in
addressing
classmates
only
when
they
wish
to
be
offensive
or
nearly
so
i
will
send
a
friend
to
meet
you
pennington
continued
why
i
thought
bantered
darrin
ironically
that
you
were
going
to
fight
me
yourself
so
i
am
be
sure
of
it
i
will
amend
my
statement
by
saying
that
i
will
send
a
second
to
see
you
save
time
by
sending
him
to
dalzell
very
good
mr
darrin
is
that
all
you
wished
to
say
to
me
yes
very
good
mr
pennington
with
two
very
stiff
nods
the
midshipmen
parted
pennington
hastened
at
once
in
search
of
hallam
will
you
serve
me
old
man
queried
pennington
sorry
but
well
you
see
pen
not
knowing
all
the
facts
of
the
case
i
must
admit
that
all
my
sympathies
are
with
darrin
all
your
sympathies
echoed
pen
frowning
well
nearly
all
anyway
you
see
i
known
and
observed
darrin
for
a
full
year
now
and
i
do
believe
patient
old
darry
is
the
one
to
start
any
trouble
he
called
me
a
liar
protested
pennington
did
he
gasped
hallam
well
he
qualified
the
statement
but
his
way
of
saying
it
was
as
offensive
as
the
direct
lie
could
have
been
so
you
bent
on
fighting
darry
i
am
too
bad
muttered
hallam
shaking
his
head
are
you
anxious
for
your
idol
asked
pen
in
a
disagreeable
tone
no
penny
it
you
that
i
concerned
about
in
my
own
mind
going
next
to
a
very
hard
proposition
darry
is
patient
almost
as
patient
as
the
proverbial
camel
but
when
he
fights
he
fights
you
be
hammered
to
a
pulp
pen
pooh
no
one
has
yet
beaten
darrin
at
a
fist
fight
there
always
has
to
be
a
first
time
you
know
and
you
think
you
it
as
far
as
darrin
is
concerned
yes
too
bad
too
bad
sighed
hallam
i
afraid
penny
that
the
heat
in
the
furnace
room
was
too
much
for
you
this
morning
then
you
wo
serve
as
one
of
my
seconds
the
honor
is
most
regretfully
declined
replied
hallam
in
a
tone
of
mock
sadness
you
want
to
see
darrin
win
if
there
has
to
be
a
fight
i
do
replied
midshipman
hallam
do
bet
your
money
on
him
anyway
i
not
a
gambler
penny
and
i
do
bet
replied
hallam
with
a
dignity
that
somehow
ended
the
conversation
pennington
had
considerable
difficulty
at
first
in
finding
a
second
at
last
however
he
induced
decker
and
briggs
to
represent
him
these
two
midshipmen
went
to
see
dan
dalzell
wait
until
i
send
for
farley
proposed
dalzell
he
soon
had
that
midshipman
who
was
wholly
willing
to
serve
darrin
in
any
capacity
we
ready
to
have
the
fight
this
evening
proposed
midshipman
decker
we
not
retorted
dan
with
vigor
why
not
this
forenoon
pennington
deliberately
stepped
on
darrin
shoulder
with
such
force
as
to
lame
it
a
good
deal
replied
dan
our
man
insists
that
he
has
a
right
to
rest
his
shoulder
and
to
wait
until
but
we
have
a
short
shore
liberty
at
hampton
roads
remonstrated
briggs
yes
and
during
that
shore
liberty
we
can
have
the
fight
more
safely
than
on
board
ship
insisted
dalzell
but
we
intended
to
devote
our
shore
leave
to
pleasure
objected
decker
you
find
plenty
of
pleasure
if
you
accept
our
proposition
urged
dan
dryly
at
any
rate
we
wo
hear
of
darrin
fighting
before
he
must
have
to
rest
that
shoulder
all
right
so
be
it
growled
decker
after
a
side
glance
at
briggs
on
shore
at
some
point
to
be
selected
by
the
seconds
asked
dan
dalzell
yes
that
agreed
details
as
to
whom
to
invite
as
referee
and
were
also
arranged
i
suppose
we
have
to
use
up
our
shore
leave
that
way
then
grunted
pennington
when
told
of
the
arrangement
there
one
way
you
can
save
the
day
grinned
decker
how
put
darrin
to
sleep
in
the
first
round
then
hurriedly
dress
and
leave
and
enjoy
your
time
on
shore
but
darrin
is
a
very
able
man
with
his
fists
observed
pennington
yes
but
you
a
mile
bigger
and
heavier
and
you
spry
too
you
ought
to
handle
him
with
all
the
ease
in
the
world
i
do
know
muttered
pennington
who
did
intend
to
make
the
mistake
of
bragging
in
advance
i
do
my
best
of
course
oh
you
win
out
if
you
awake
predicted
midshipman
briggs
confidently
when
the
cadets
were
called
the
following
morning
they
found
the
battleship
fleet
at
anchor
in
hampton
roads
chapter
v
when
the
seconds
wondered
one
after
another
the
launches
sped
ashore
carrying
their
swarms
of
distinguished
looking
young
midshipmen
the
fight
party
managed
to
get
off
all
in
the
same
boat
and
on
one
of
the
earliest
trips
pennington
was
to
have
ordinary
shore
leave
on
the
cruise
his
fifty
demerits
to
be
paid
for
by
loss
of
privileges
on
his
return
to
the
naval
academy
decker
proposed
dan
you
and
i
can
skip
away
and
find
a
good
place
in
no
time
then
we
can
come
back
after
the
others
that
agreeable
to
me
nodded
midshipman
decker
in
twenty
minutes
the
two
seconds
were
back
we
found
just
the
place
announced
decker
and
it
is
more
than
three
minutes
walk
from
here
will
you
all
hurry
along
the
place
turned
out
to
be
a
barn
that
had
not
been
used
for
a
year
or
more
the
floor
was
almost
immaculately
clean
in
consideration
of
two
dollars
handed
him
the
owner
had
agreed
to
display
no
curiosity
and
not
to
mention
the
affair
to
any
one
how
do
you
like
it
darry
asked
dan
anxiously
it
will
suit
me
as
well
as
any
other
place
responded
dave
slipping
off
his
blouse
folding
it
neatly
and
putting
it
aside
his
uniform
cap
following
and
you
asked
decker
of
his
man
the
floor
hard
but
i
do
expect
to
be
the
man
to
hit
it
replied
pennington
in
five
minutes
both
midshipmen
were
attired
for
their
affair
between
them
the
different
members
of
the
party
had
smuggled
ashore
shoes
old
trousers
and
belts
for
the
fighters
it
being
a
class
affair
remington
of
the
third
class
had
come
along
as
referee
while
dawley
was
to
be
the
if
the
principals
are
ready
let
them
step
forward
ordered
midshipman
remington
going
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
now
i
understand
that
this
is
to
be
a
finish
fight
rounds
two
minutes
rests
two
minutes
i
also
understand
that
the
principals
do
not
care
to
shake
hands
before
the
call
to
mix
up
darrin
and
pennington
nodded
their
assent
take
your
places
gentlemen
ordered
the
referee
quickly
are
you
ready
gentlemen
yes
came
from
both
principals
time
both
men
had
their
guards
up
as
the
word
left
the
referee
lips
each
tried
two
or
three
passes
which
the
other
blocked
midshipman
pennington
was
trying
to
take
his
opponent
measure
then
dave
ducked
darted
dodged
and
wheeled
about
pennington
had
to
follow
him
and
it
made
the
latter
angry
stand
up
and
fight
ca
you
hissed
pen
silence
during
the
rounds
pennington
admonished
the
referee
quietly
let
the
officials
do
all
the
talking
that
may
be
necessary
dave
as
he
dodged
again
and
came
up
unscathed
grinned
broadly
over
this
rebuke
that
grin
made
pen
angrier
than
anything
else
could
have
done
i
wipe
that
grin
off
his
face
muttered
pennington
angrily
and
this
very
thing
pennington
tried
hard
to
do
he
was
quick
on
his
own
feet
and
for
a
few
seconds
he
followed
the
dodging
darrin
about
raining
in
blows
that
required
all
of
dave
adroitness
to
escape
dave
very
success
however
made
his
opponent
all
the
angrier
from
annoyance
followed
by
excessive
irritation
pennington
went
into
almost
blind
rage
and
the
man
who
does
that
anywhere
in
life
must
always
pay
for
it
suddenly
dave
swung
his
right
in
on
the
point
of
pen
chin
with
a
force
that
jolted
the
larger
midshipman
as
part
of
the
same
movement
darrin
left
crashed
against
pennington
nose
then
out
of
chivalry
dave
dropped
back
to
give
pen
a
few
moments
in
case
he
needed
them
to
get
his
wits
back
time
roared
dawley
and
pennington
seconds
pounced
upon
him
and
bore
him
away
to
his
corner
now
i
know
how
that
fellow
darrin
wins
his
fights
growled
pennington
in
an
undertone
he
keeps
on
running
away
until
he
has
the
other
man
gasping
for
breath
then
darrin
jumps
in
and
wins
the
method
does
much
matter
commented
briggs
dryly
as
he
and
decker
worked
over
their
man
it
the
result
that
counts
rush
darry
into
a
tight
corner
pen
and
then
slam
him
hard
and
sufficiently
thanks
fellows
now
i
all
right
for
the
second
round
muttered
midshipman
pennington
in
a
few
seconds
more
dave
and
his
opponent
were
hard
at
work
dave
still
used
his
footwork
and
most
cleverly
yet
wherever
he
went
pen
followed
him
nimbly
it
did
look
so
one
sided
now
then
pennington
at
last
managed
to
deliver
one
blow
on
darrin
right
short
ribs
it
took
a
lot
of
dave
spare
wind
he
raced
about
seeking
to
regain
his
wind
before
allowing
close
quarters
but
at
last
pennington
closed
in
again
and
after
a
swift
feint
tried
to
land
the
same
blow
darrin
was
watching
and
blocked
then
his
temples
reddening
with
anger
dave
swung
in
a
huge
one
that
crashed
in
under
pennington
right
ear
time
shouted
dawley
just
as
pen
went
to
the
floor
in
a
heap
that
saved
the
larger
midshipman
from
having
to
take
the
count
his
seconds
had
him
ready
at
the
call
for
the
third
round
now
suddenly
darrin
seemed
to
change
not
only
his
tactics
but
his
whole
personality
to
his
opponent
dave
seemed
suddenly
transformed
into
a
dancing
demon
it
was
about
the
same
old
footwork
but
it
was
aggressive
now
instead
of
being
defensive
first
dave
landed
a
light
tap
on
the
already
suffering
nose
a
few
seconds
later
he
landed
on
the
point
of
pen
chin
though
not
hard
enough
to
send
his
man
down
then
a
rather
light
blow
on
the
jaw
just
under
pen
right
ear
again
the
larger
midshipman
was
now
thoroughly
alarmed
he
feared
that
darrin
could
do
whatever
he
willed
and
shivered
with
wonder
as
to
when
the
knockout
blow
would
come
the
truth
was
pennington
was
still
putting
up
a
better
battle
than
he
himself
realized
and
darrin
was
not
disposed
to
take
any
foolish
chances
through
rushing
the
affair
thus
the
third
round
ended
by
the
time
that
they
came
up
for
the
fourth
round
after
both
men
had
undergone
some
vigorous
handling
by
their
respective
seconds
pennington
was
a
good
deal
revived
and
far
more
confident
dave
tactics
were
the
same
in
the
fourth
round
pennington
did
find
time
to
develop
much
in
the
way
of
tactics
for
himself
save
to
defend
himself
during
the
first
minute
no
important
blows
were
landed
on
either
side
then
suddenly
dave
darted
in
and
under
and
brought
a
hook
against
pen
nose
in
a
way
that
started
that
member
to
bleeding
again
and
with
a
steady
flow
that
jarred
the
larger
midshipman
he
plunged
in
heavily
and
blindly
blocking
one
of
darrin
blows
by
wrapping
both
arms
around
him
none
of
that
pennington
break
away
fast
ordered
midshipman
remington
quickly
dave
took
a
fair
get
away
not
attempting
to
strike
as
the
clinch
was
broken
but
an
instant
later
dave
came
back
dancing
all
around
his
dazed
opponent
landing
on
the
short
ribs
on
the
breast
bone
under
either
ear
and
finally
on
the
tip
of
the
chin
pen
was
sure
that
none
of
these
blows
had
been
delivered
with
the
force
that
darrin
could
have
sent
in
time
shouted
midshipman
dawley
the
principals
retired
to
their
corners
pennington
almost
wholly
afraid
from
the
conviction
that
his
antagonist
was
now
merely
playing
with
him
to
keep
the
interest
going
so
pennington
was
still
rather
badly
scared
when
the
two
came
together
for
the
fifth
round
get
lively
now
gentlemen
if
you
can
begged
referee
remington
finish
this
one
way
or
the
other
and
let
us
get
some
of
the
benefits
of
our
shore
leave
pen
started
by
putting
more
steam
behind
every
blow
dave
who
had
used
up
so
much
of
his
wind
by
his
brilliant
footwork
began
to
find
it
harder
to
keep
the
upper
hand
twice
however
he
managed
to
land
body
blows
he
was
trying
to
drive
in
a
third
when
pennington
blocked
following
this
with
a
jab
on
darrin
left
jaw
that
sent
the
lighter
man
to
the
floor
instantly
dawley
began
to
count
off
the
seven
eight
nine
te
dave
was
up
on
his
feet
pen
tried
to
make
a
quick
rush
but
darrin
dodged
cleverly
them
wheeled
and
faced
his
opponent
as
the
latter
wheeled
about
after
that
there
was
less
footwork
both
men
stood
up
to
it
as
keenly
alert
as
they
could
be
each
trying
to
drive
home
heavy
blows
while
they
were
still
at
it
the
call
of
time
sounded
do
let
him
put
it
over
you
david
little
giant
warned
dan
as
the
latter
and
farley
vigorously
massaged
darrin
muscles
he
all
but
had
you
and
there
is
any
need
of
making
pen
a
present
of
the
meeting
i
tried
to
get
him
muttered
dave
in
an
undertone
and
i
shall
go
on
trying
to
the
last
but
pennington
is
pretty
nearly
superior
to
anyone
in
my
class
just
waltz
in
and
show
him
whispered
dalzell
as
the
call
sounded
pennington
entered
the
sixth
round
with
more
confidence
he
began
at
the
outset
to
drive
in
heavy
blows
nor
did
dave
do
much
dodging
bump
seconds
only
of
this
round
had
gone
when
darrin
landed
his
right
fist
with
fearful
force
upon
the
high
point
of
jaw
down
went
the
larger
midshipman
again
this
time
he
moaned
his
eyes
were
open
though
they
had
a
somewhat
glassy
look
in
them
dawley
was
counting
off
the
seconds
in
measured
seven
eight
nine
ten
pen
had
struggled
to
rise
to
his
feet
but
sank
back
with
a
gasp
of
despair
and
rage
pennington
loses
the
count
and
the
fight
announced
referee
remington
coolly
i
do
believe
we
needed
here
dawley
the
seconds
can
handle
the
wreck
come
along
as
the
two
officials
of
the
meeting
hustled
out
of
the
barn
dalzell
gave
his
attention
to
helping
his
chum
while
farley
went
over
to
offer
his
services
in
getting
the
vanquished
midshipman
into
shape
there
were
times
when
i
could
have
closed
both
of
pennington
eyes
murmured
dave
to
dan
but
i
did
want
to
give
him
any
disfiguring
marks
that
would
start
questions
on
board
ship
you
had
him
whipped
from
the
start
murmured
dan
confidently
as
he
sprayed
then
rubbed
dave
chest
and
arms
maybe
but
i
not
so
sure
of
that
rejoined
darrin
that
fellow
is
so
easy
a
prize
for
any
one
in
my
class
there
were
times
when
i
was
all
but
convinced
that
he
had
me
oh
fairy
tales
grunted
dan
have
it
your
own
way
then
danny
boy
when
darrin
and
his
seconds
left
the
barn
they
went
off
to
enjoy
what
remained
of
the
shore
leave
pennington
seconds
finally
at
his
own
request
left
him
at
an
ice
cream
parlor
where
he
proposed
to
remain
until
he
could
return
to
the
big
steel
massachusetts
without
exciting
any
wonder
over
the
little
time
he
had
remained
ashore
pennington
had
strength
to
walk
about
but
he
was
far
from
being
in
really
good
shape
and
preferred
to
keep
quiet
chapter
vi
in
trouble
on
foreign
soil
from
hampton
roads
the
battleship
squadron
with
the
midshipmen
on
board
sailed
directly
for
plymouth
england
during
most
of
the
voyage
over
slow
cruising
speed
was
used
by
the
time
that
england
coast
was
sighted
the
middies
found
they
knew
much
more
about
a
battleship
than
they
had
believed
to
be
possible
at
the
start
of
the
voyage
they
had
served
as
firemen
they
had
mastered
many
of
the
electrical
details
of
a
battleship
they
had
received
instruction
and
had
stood
trick
by
the
engines
there
had
been
some
drill
with
the
smaller
guns
and
finally
they
had
learned
at
least
the
rudiments
of
as
signaling
by
means
of
signal
flags
is
termed
it
was
just
before
the
call
to
supper
formation
when
england
coast
loomed
up
most
of
the
midshipmen
stood
at
the
rail
watching
eagerly
for
a
better
glimpse
at
the
coast
some
of
the
midshipmen
especially
those
who
came
from
wealthier
families
had
been
in
england
before
entering
the
naval
academy
these
fortunate
ones
were
questioned
eagerly
by
their
comrades
the
battleships
were
well
in
sight
of
eastern
king
point
when
the
midshipmen
call
for
supper
formation
sounded
feeling
that
they
would
much
have
preferred
to
wait
for
their
supper
the
young
men
hastened
below
after
the
line
was
formed
it
seemed
to
the
impatient
young
men
as
though
it
had
never
taken
so
long
to
read
the
orders
yet
there
came
one
welcome
order
to
the
effect
that
immediately
after
the
morning
meal
all
midshipmen
might
go
to
the
pay
officer
and
draw
ten
dollars
to
be
charged
against
their
pay
accounts
that
ten
dollars
apiece
looms
up
large
david
little
giant
murmured
dan
dalzell
while
the
evening
meal
was
in
progress
we
ought
to
have
a
lot
of
fun
on
it
replied
darrin
who
was
looking
forward
with
greatest
eagerness
to
his
first
visit
to
any
foreign
soil
but
how
much
shore
leave
are
we
to
have
two
days
the
word
is
we
get
it
straight
in
the
morning
at
breakfast
formation
in
defiance
of
regulations
midshipman
pennington
whose
father
was
wealthy
had
several
hundred
dollars
concealed
in
his
baggage
he
had
already
invited
hallam
mossworth
and
dickey
to
keep
in
his
wake
on
shore
and
these
young
men
had
gladly
enough
agreed
say
but
we
slackening
speed
quivered
dalzell
when
the
meal
was
nearly
finished
headway
has
stopped
declared
darrin
a
few
moments
later
listen
everyone
called
farley
do
you
hear
the
rattle
of
the
anchor
chains
gentlemen
as
we
forbidden
to
make
too
much
racket
proposed
irrepressible
dan
let
us
give
three
silent
cheers
for
old
england
rising
in
his
place
dan
raised
his
hand
aloft
and
brought
it
down
as
his
lips
silently
formed
a
hurrah
three
times
this
was
done
each
time
the
lips
of
the
midshipmen
forming
a
silent
cheer
then
dan
with
a
mighty
swoop
of
his
right
arm
let
his
lips
form
the
word
that
everyone
knew
to
be
tiger
groaned
midshipman
reilly
throw
that
irresponsible
fenian
out
directed
dan
grinning
then
the
midshipmen
turned
their
attention
to
the
remnants
of
the
meal
boom
sounded
sharply
overhead
there
goes
the
announced
darrin
when
a
foreign
battleship
enters
a
fortified
port
the
visiting
fleet
or
rather
its
flagship
fires
a
national
salute
of
guns
after
a
short
interval
following
the
discharge
of
the
last
gun
one
of
the
forts
on
shore
answers
with
guns
this
is
one
of
the
methods
of
observing
the
courtesies
between
nations
by
their
respective
fleets
ere
all
the
guns
had
been
fired
from
the
flagship
the
third
classmen
received
the
rising
signal
the
class
marched
out
and
was
dismissed
instantly
a
break
was
made
for
deck
the
midshipmen
were
in
good
time
to
see
the
smoke
and
hear
the
roar
of
guns
from
one
of
the
forts
on
shore
in
the
morning
the
commandant
of
cadets
as
commanding
officer
of
the
squadron
would
go
ashore
with
his
aide
and
pay
a
formal
call
to
the
senior
military
officer
later
in
the
day
that
english
officer
and
one
or
two
of
his
staff
officers
would
return
the
call
by
coming
out
to
the
flagship
that
accomplished
all
the
required
courtesies
would
have
been
observed
it
was
still
broad
daylight
for
in
summer
the
english
twilight
is
a
long
one
and
darkness
does
not
settle
down
until
late
oh
if
we
were
only
going
ashore
murmured
hallam
there
were
many
others
to
echo
the
thought
but
all
knew
that
it
could
not
be
done
could
we
find
a
trick
for
slipping
ashore
after
lights
out
eagerly
queried
dickey
who
was
not
noted
as
a
greaser
could
we
quivered
hallam
who
with
few
demerits
against
him
felt
inclined
to
take
a
chance
but
pennington
to
whom
he
appealed
shook
his
head
too
big
a
risk
hally
replied
pen
and
trebly
dangerous
with
that
greaser
darrin
in
the
class
oh
stow
that
growled
hallam
darrin
is
no
greaser
you
got
him
on
your
black
books
that
all
he
is
a
greaser
i
tell
you
cried
pennington
fiercely
there
were
a
score
of
midshipmen
in
this
group
and
many
of
them
nodded
approvingly
at
pennington
statement
though
still
a
class
leader
dave
had
lost
some
of
his
popularity
since
his
report
to
the
police
of
annapolis
so
the
middies
turned
in
that
night
with
unsatisfied
dreams
of
shore
life
in
england
soon
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
however
every
midshipman
had
drawn
his
ten
dollars
even
to
pennington
who
had
no
use
for
such
a
trifling
amount
as
fast
as
possible
the
launches
ranged
alongside
at
the
side
gangway
taking
off
groups
of
midshipmen
everyone
of
whom
had
been
cautioned
to
be
at
dock
in
time
to
board
a
launch
in
season
for
supper
formation
pennington
and
his
party
were
among
the
first
to
land
they
hurried
away
it
was
on
the
second
trip
of
one
of
the
launches
that
dave
dan
and
farley
made
their
get
away
these
three
chums
had
agreed
to
stick
together
during
the
day
they
landed
at
the
great
western
docks
to
find
themselves
surrounded
by
eager
british
cabbies
are
we
going
to
take
a
cab
and
get
more
quickly
and
intelligently
to
the
best
part
of
the
town
to
see
asked
farley
i
do
vote
for
it
replied
darrin
we
have
only
five
dollars
apiece
for
each
of
the
two
days
we
to
be
ashore
i
move
that
we
put
in
the
forenoon
anyway
in
prowling
about
the
town
for
ourselves
we
learn
more
than
we
would
by
riding
come
on
then
approved
dan
plymouth
is
an
english
seaport
that
has
been
rather
famous
ever
since
the
thirteenth
century
many
parts
of
the
town
including
whole
streets
look
as
though
the
houses
had
been
built
since
that
time
this
is
especially
true
of
many
of
the
streets
near
the
water
front
for
two
hours
the
three
middies
roamed
through
the
streets
often
meeting
fellow
classmen
wherever
the
young
midshipmen
went
many
of
the
english
workmen
and
shopkeepers
raised
their
hats
in
friendly
salute
of
the
american
uniform
we
do
seem
to
run
across
pen
gang
anywhere
remarked
farley
at
last
oh
no
smiled
dave
that
a
capitalistic
crowd
they
hit
only
the
high
spots
nevertheless
these
three
midshipmen
enjoyed
themselves
hugely
in
seeing
the
quaint
old
town
at
noon
they
found
a
real
old
english
chop
house
where
they
enjoyed
a
famous
meal
i
wish
we
could
slip
some
of
these
little
mutton
pies
back
with
us
sighed
dan
wistfully
in
the
afternoon
the
three
chums
saw
the
newer
market
place
where
all
three
bought
small
souvenirs
for
their
mothers
at
home
darrin
also
secured
a
little
remembrance
present
for
his
sweetheart
belle
meade
the
guild
hall
and
some
of
the
other
famous
buildings
were
visited
later
in
the
afternoon
dave
began
to
inspect
his
watch
every
two
or
three
minutes
no
need
for
us
to
worry
with
dave
eye
glued
to
his
watch
laughed
dan
come
on
fellows
summoned
darrin
finally
we
have
more
than
time
now
to
make
the
dock
and
get
back
to
supper
formation
take
a
cab
asked
farley
you
know
we
found
that
they
vastly
cheaper
than
american
cabs
not
for
me
decided
dave
we
need
the
rest
of
our
shore
money
and
our
legs
are
good
and
sturdy
yet
even
careful
dave
as
it
turned
out
had
allowed
no
more
than
time
the
chums
reached
the
dock
in
time
to
see
the
launches
half
way
between
the
fleet
and
shore
some
forty
other
midshipmen
stood
waiting
on
the
dock
among
these
were
pennington
and
his
party
all
looking
highly
satisfied
with
their
day
sport
as
indeed
they
were
pennington
eyes
gleamed
when
he
caught
sight
of
darrin
dalzell
and
farley
for
pen
had
a
scheme
of
his
own
in
mind
not
far
from
pennington
stood
a
little
englishman
with
keen
eyes
and
a
jovial
face
pen
stepped
over
to
him
there
are
the
three
midshipmen
i
was
telling
you
about
whispered
pennington
slipping
a
half
sovereign
into
the
englishman
hand
you
thoroughly
understand
your
part
in
the
joke
do
you
do
though
just
sir
laughed
the
undersized
englishman
and
strolled
away
darrin
and
his
friends
were
soon
informed
by
classmates
that
the
launches
now
making
were
coming
in
on
their
last
trip
for
midshipmen
well
we
here
in
plenty
of
time
sighed
dave
contentedly
oh
i
knew
we
be
with
you
holding
the
watch
laughed
dan
in
his
satisfied
way
as
the
three
stood
apart
they
were
joined
by
the
undersized
englishman
who
touched
his
hat
to
them
with
a
show
of
great
respect
young
gentlemen
he
inquired
suppose
course
you
a
look

the
time
went
sank
the
great
spanish
why
no
my
friend
replied
dave
looking
at
the
man
with
interest
is
that
here
at
plymouth
sir
a
minute
walk
to
that
shed
yonder
sir
you
come
with
me
young
gentlemen
show
to
you
one
of
biggest
sights
it
in
me
own
custody
at
present
come
this
way
young
gentlemen
that
sounds
like
something
worth
seeing
declared
dave
to
his
comrades
come
along
it
take
the
launches
at
least
six
minutes
to
get
in
and
then
they
stay
tied
up
here
for
another
five
minutes
with
only
a
single
backward
glance
at
the
young
midshipmen
the
undersized
englishman
was
already
leading
the
way
at
quickened
pace
the
young
midshipmen
reached
the
shed
that
had
been
indicated
their
guide
had
already
drawn
a
key
from
a
pocket
and
had
unsnapped
the
heavy
padlock
step
right
in
young
gentlemen
follow
show
to
you
unsuspecting
the
three
middies
stepped
inside
the
darkened
shed
suddenly
the
door
banged
and
a
padlock
clicked
outside
here
stop
that
you
rascally
joker
roared
dalzell
wheeling
about
what
does
this
mean
big
trouble
spoke
dave
darrin
seriously
and
with
a
face
from
which
the
color
was
fast
receding
chapter
vii
pennington
gets
his
wish
the
scoundrel
gasped
farley
his
face
whiter
than
any
of
the
others
dave
was
already
at
the
door
trying
to
force
it
open
but
he
might
almost
as
well
have
tried
to
lift
one
of
the
guns
of
the
battleship
massachusetts
we
locked
in
that
sure
gasped
dalzell
almost
dazed
by
the
catastrophe
and
what
more
we
wo
get
out
in
a
hurry
unless
we
can
make
some
of
our
classmates
hear
declared
dave
for
the
next
half
minute
they
yelled
themselves
nearly
hoarse
but
no
response
came
what
could
have
been
that
little
cockney
purpose
in
playing
this
shabby
trick
on
us
demanded
farley
perhaps
the
cockney
thinks
we
admirals
with
our
pockets
lined
with
gold
perhaps
he
and
some
of
his
pals
intend
to
rob
us
later
in
the
evening
proposed
dan
with
a
ghastly
grin
any
gang
would
find
something
of
a
fight
on
their
hands
then
muttered
dave
darrin
grimly
all
three
were
equally
at
a
loss
to
think
of
any
explanation
for
such
a
joke
as
this
equally
improbable
did
it
seem
that
any
thugs
of
the
town
would
expect
to
reap
any
harvest
from
robbing
three
midshipmen
desperately
they
turned
to
survey
their
surroundings
the
shed
was
an
old
one
yet
strongly
built
there
were
no
windows
no
other
door
save
that
at
which
the
three
middies
now
stood
baffled
another
good
old
yell
proposed
darrin
it
was
given
with
a
lusty
will
but
proved
as
fruitless
as
the
former
one
we
do
take
the
last
launch
back
to
ship
declared
farley
wild
with
rage
which
means
a
long
string
of
demerits
said
dan
no
shore
leave
either
groaned
darrin
fellows
this
mishap
will
affect
our
shore
leave
throughout
all
the
cruise
we
can
explain
it
suggested
farley
with
a
hopefulness
that
he
did
not
feel
at
all
of
course
we
can
jeered
dave
darrin
but
what
officer
is
fool
enough
to
believe
such
a
story
as
this
one
will
seem
at
the
very
least
the
commandant
would
believe
that
we
had
been
playing
some
pretty
stiff
prank
ourselves
in
order
to
get
treated
in
this
fashion
no
no
fellows
we
may
just
as
well
undeceive
ourselves
and
prepare
to
take
the
full
soaking
of
discipline
that
we
bound
to
get
if
we
attempted
this
sort
of
explanation
we
be
lucky
indeed
to
get
through
the
affair
without
being
tried
by
general
for
lying
drake
anchor
indeed
exclaimed
dan
in
deep
self
disgust
we
ought
to
have
known
better
grunted
farley
equally
enraged
with
himself
what
on
earth
made
us
so
as
to
believe
that
a
priceless
relic
would
be
kept
in
an
old
shed
like
this
we
sure
enough
idiots
groaned
dan
hold
on
there
fellows
interrupted
dave
darrin
vent
all
your
anger
right
on
me
i
the
great
and
only
cause
of
this
misfortune
it
was
i
who
proposed
that
we
take
up
that
cockney
invitation
i
the
real
and
only
offender
against
decent
good
sense
and
yet
you
both
have
to
suffer
with
me
let
give
another
yell
bigger
than
before
suggested
dan
weakly
they
did
but
with
no
better
result
than
before
the
launches
are
away
now
anyway
i
guess
groaned
farley
after
consulting
his
watch
yes
and
we
up
the
tree
with
the
commandant
grunted
dalzell
bitterly
yell
again
asked
farley
no
retorted
dave
shaking
his
head
we
seen
the
uselessness
of
asking
help
from
outside
let
supply
our
own
help
now
then
altogether
shoulder
the
door
a
savage
assault
they
hurled
upon
the
door
but
they
merely
caused
it
to
vibrate
we
ca
do
it
gasped
dan
after
the
third
trial
considerable
daylight
filtered
in
through
the
cracks
at
top
bottom
and
one
side
of
the
door
further
back
in
the
shed
there
was
less
light
let
explore
this
old
place
in
search
of
hope
begged
dave
together
they
started
back
looking
about
keenly
in
what
appeared
to
be
an
empty
room
say
look
at
that
cried
dave
suddenly
he
pointed
to
a
solid
looking
not
very
heavy
ship
spar
what
good
will
that
thing
do
us
asked
farley
rather
dubiously
let
see
if
we
can
raise
it
to
our
shoulders
proposed
dave
darrin
radiantly
then
well
find
out
hurrah
quivered
dan
dalzell
bending
over
the
spar
at
the
middle
up
with
it
commanded
darrin
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
the
spar
farley
took
hold
at
the
further
end
up
with
it
heaved
midshipman
darrin
right
up
the
spar
went
it
would
have
been
a
heavy
job
for
three
young
men
of
their
size
in
civil
life
but
midshipmen
are
constantly
undergoing
the
best
sort
of
physical
training
now
then
a
fast
run
and
a
hard
bump
called
darrin
at
the
door
they
rushed
bearing
the
spar
as
a
battering
ram
bump
the
door
shook
and
shivered
once
more
may
do
it
cheered
darrin
back
again
they
dashed
the
head
of
their
battering
ram
against
the
door
it
gave
way
and
climbing
through
they
raced
back
to
the
pier
but
dan
who
had
secured
the
lead
stopped
with
a
groan
pointing
out
over
the
water
not
a
bit
of
good
fellows
there
go
the
launches
and
we
the
only
fellows
left
it
all
up
with
our
summer
fun
is
it
though
shouted
dave
spurting
ahead
come
on
and
find
out
as
they
reached
the
front
of
the
piers
down
at
the
edge
of
a
landing
stage
they
espied
a
little
steam
tender
that
boat
has
to
take
us
out
to
the
cried
darrin
desperately
as
he
plunged
down
the
steps
to
the
landing
stage
followed
by
his
two
chums
illustration
the
three
midshipmen
raced
toward
the
pier
who
the
captain
here
called
dave
racing
across
the
landing
stage
to
the
tender
gangplank
i
am
sir
replied
a
portly
englishman
leaning
out
of
the
window
what
you
charge
to
land
us
in
haste
aboard
the
american
battleship
asked
darrin
eagerly
half
a
sov
will
be
about
right
sir
replied
the
tender
skipper
touching
his
cap
at
sight
of
the
american
naval
uniform
good
enough
glowed
dave
leaping
aboard
cast
off
as
quickly
as
you
can
captain
or
we
be
in
a
heap
of
trouble
with
our
discipline
officers
the
english
skipper
was
quick
to
act
he
routed
out
two
deckhands
who
quickly
cast
off
almost
while
the
deckhands
were
doing
this
the
skipper
rang
the
engineer
bell
come
into
the
with
me
invited
the
skipper
pleasantly
which
invitation
the
three
middies
accepted
now
then
young
gentlemen
did
it
that
you
missed
your
own
launches
it
was
a
mean
trick
a
scoundrelly
one
cried
darrin
resentfully
then
he
described
just
what
had
happened
the
skipper
own
bronzed
cheeks
burned
to
a
deeper
color
i
can
believe
that
an
englishman
would
play
such
a
trick
on
young
of
a
friendly
power
he
declared
but
i
told
you
sir
the
fare
out
to
your
ship
would
be
half
a
sov
i
lied
if
a
nasty
little
cockney
played
such
a
trick
on
you
it
my
place
as
a
decent
englishman
to
take
you
out
for
nothing
and
that
the
fare
oh
we
gladly
pay
the
half
sov
protested
darrin
not
on
this
craft
you
ca
sir
replied
the
skipper
firmly
looking
eagerly
ahead
the
three
middies
saw
two
of
the
launches
go
along
side
of
the
massachusetts
and
discharge
passengers
as
the
second
left
the
side
gangway
the
briton
who
had
been
crowding
on
steam
well
ranged
in
along
side
what
craft
is
that
and
what
do
you
want
hailed
the
officer
of
the
deck
from
above
the
tender
sir
with
three
of
your
gentlemen
to
put
of
you
sir
the
briton
bellowed
through
a
window
of
the
very
good
then
come
alongside
directed
the
officer
of
the
deck
in
his
most
seamanlike
style
the
briton
ranged
alongside
dave
tried
to
press
the
fare
upon
the
skipper
but
he
would
have
none
of
that
so
the
three
shook
hands
swiftly
but
heartily
with
him
then
sprang
across
to
the
side
gangway
where
they
paused
long
enough
to
lift
their
caps
to
this
stranger
and
friend
the
briton
lifted
his
own
cap
waving
it
heartily
ere
he
fell
off
and
turned
about
you
did
get
aboard
any
too
soon
gentlemen
remarked
the
officer
of
the
deck
eyeing
the
three
middies
keenly
as
they
came
up
over
the
side
doffing
their
uniform
caps
to
the
colors
hustle
for
the
formation
midshipman
pennington
was
chuckling
deeply
over
the
supposed
fact
that
he
had
at
last
succeeded
in
bringing
darrin
in
for
as
many
demerits
as
darrin
had
helped
heap
upon
him
that
break
his
heart
as
an
avowed
greaser
pen
told
himself
with
all
the
demerits
darrin
will
get
he
have
no
heart
for
greasing
the
rest
of
this
year
it
rough
on
farley
but
i
not
quite
as
sorry
for
dalzell
who
in
his
way
is
almost
as
bad
as
darrin
he
cuckoo
and
shadow
anyway
oh
i
wish
i
could
see
darrin
face
now
this
last
was
uttered
just
as
midshipman
pennington
stepped
into
line
at
the
supper
formation
i
wish
i
could
see
darrin
face
now
pen
repeated
to
himself
seldom
has
a
wish
been
more
quickly
gratified
for
just
in
the
nick
of
time
to
avoid
being
reported
midshipmen
darrin
dalzell
and
farley
came
into
sight
falling
into
their
respective
places
at
that
instant
it
was
midshipman
pennington
face
not
dave
darrin
that
was
really
worth
studying
now
how
did
the
shameless
greaser
work
this
pennington
pondered
uneasily
but
of
course
he
could
ask
he
could
only
hope
that
presently
he
would
hear
the
whole
story
from
some
other
man
in
the
class
chapter
viii
the
tragedy
of
the
gale
there
is
altogether
too
much
to
the
summer
practice
cruise
for
it
to
be
related
in
detail
nor
would
the
telling
of
it
prove
interesting
to
the
reader
when
at
sea
save
on
sundays
the
midshipman
day
is
one
of
hard
toil
it
is
no
life
for
the
indolent
young
man
he
is
routed
out
early
in
the
morning
and
put
at
hard
work
on
a
midshipman
first
summer
cruise
what
he
learns
is
largely
the
work
that
is
done
by
the
seamen
stokers
water
tenders
electricians
the
signal
men
and
others
yet
he
must
learn
every
phase
of
all
this
work
thoroughly
for
some
day
before
he
becomes
an
officer
he
must
be
examined
as
to
his
knowledge
of
all
this
great
mass
of
detail
it
is
only
when
in
port
that
some
relaxation
comes
into
the
life
he
has
shore
leave
and
a
large
measure
of
liberty
yet
he
must
at
all
times
show
all
possible
respect
for
the
uniform
that
he
wears
and
the
great
nation
that
he
represents
if
a
midshipman
permits
himself
to
be
led
into
scrapes
that
many
college
boys
regard
as
merely
larks
he
is
considered
a
disgrace
to
the
naval
service
always
at
home
and
abroad
the
middy
must
maintain
his
own
dignity
and
that
of
his
country
and
service
should
he
fail
seriously
he
is
regarded
by
his
superiors
and
by
the
navy
department
as
being
unfit
to
defend
the
honor
of
his
flag
the
wildest
group
from
the
summer
practice
fleet
was
that
made
up
of
pennington
and
his
friends
pen
received
more
money
in
france
from
his
fond
but
foolish
father
wherever
pennington
group
went
they
cut
a
wide
swath
of
sport
though
they
did
nothing
actually
dishonorable
yet
they
were
guilty
of
many
pranks
which
had
the
midshipmen
been
caught
would
have
resulted
in
demerits
ports
in
france
spain
portugal
and
italy
were
touched
briefly
at
some
of
these
ports
the
midshipmen
received
much
attention
but
at
last
the
fleet
turned
back
past
gibraltar
and
stood
on
for
the
azores
the
last
landing
point
before
reaching
home
when
two
nights
out
from
gibraltar
a
sharp
summer
gale
overtook
the
fleet
even
the
huge
battleships
labored
heavily
in
the
seas
the
massachusetts
bringing
up
the
rear
she
was
in
the
same
position
when
the
morning
broke
the
midshipmen
after
breakfast
enjoyed
a
few
minutes
on
the
deck
before
going
below
for
duty
in
the
engine
rooms
the
dynamo
room
the
stoke
hole
and
other
stations
suddenly
from
the
stern
rail
there
went
up
the
startled
cry
man
overboard
in
an
instant
the
marine
sentry
had
tumbled
two
over
into
the
water
with
almost
the
swiftness
of
telegraphy
the
cry
had
reached
the
bridge
without
stopping
to
back
the
engine
the
big
battleship
helm
was
thrown
hard
over
and
the
great
steel
fighting
craft
endeavored
to
find
her
own
wake
in
the
angry
waters
with
a
view
to
going
back
over
it
signal
men
broke
out
the
news
to
the
flagship
the
other
two
great
battleships
turned
and
headed
back
in
the
interests
of
humanity
it
seemed
almost
as
though
the
entire
fleet
had
been
swung
out
of
its
course
by
pressure
on
an
electric
button
officers
who
were
not
on
duty
poured
out
the
captain
was
the
first
to
reach
the
he
strode
into
the
midst
of
a
group
of
midshipmen
who
overboard
demanded
the
commanding
officer
hallam
sir
and
darrin
sir
and
dalzell
sir
how
many
demanded
the
captain
sharply
three
sir
how
did
so
many
fall
overboard
hallam
was
frolicking
sir
reported
midshipman
farley
and
lost
his
footing
but
darrin
and
mr
dalzell
inquired
the
captain
sharply
as
soon
as
they
realized
it
sir
darrin
and
dalzell
leaped
overboard
to
go
to
hallam
rescue
sir
it
a
wonder
muttered
the
captain
glancing
shrewdly
at
the
bronzed
fine
young
fellows
around
him
that
not
more
of
you
went
overboard
as
well
many
of
them
would
sir
replied
farley
but
an
officer
forward
shouted
more
midshipmen
go
overboard
so
we
stopped
sir
modest
farley
did
not
mention
the
fact
that
he
was
running
toward
the
stern
intent
on
following
his
chums
into
the
rough
sea
at
the
very
instant
when
the
order
reached
him
the
captain
however
paused
for
no
more
information
he
was
now
running
forward
to
take
the
bridge
beside
the
watch
officer
the
midshipmen
too
hurried
forward
mingling
with
the
crew
as
the
big
battleship
swung
around
and
tried
to
find
her
wake
the
flagship
had
crowded
on
extra
steam
and
was
fast
coming
over
the
seas
with
such
a
sea
running
it
was
well
nigh
impossible
to
make
out
so
small
a
thing
as
a
head
or
a
unless
it
could
be
observed
at
the
instant
when
it
crested
a
wave
marine
glasses
were
in
use
by
every
officer
who
had
brought
his
pair
to
the
deck
others
rushed
back
to
their
cabins
to
get
them
a
lieutenant
of
the
marine
corps
stood
forward
close
to
a
big
group
of
sorrowing
midshipmen
there
are
certain
to
be
three
vacancies
in
the
naval
academy
remarked
the
lieutenant
do
say
that
sir
begged
farley
in
a
choking
voice
the
three
overboard
are
among
the
finest
fellows
in
the
brigade
i
do
want
to
discourage
any
of
you
young
gentlemen
continued
the
marine
corps
lieutenant
but
there
just
about
one
chance
in
a
thousand
that
we
shall
be
able
to
sight
and
pick
up
any
one
of
the
unlucky
three
in
the
first
place
it
would
take
a
wonderful
swimmer
to
live
long
in
such
a
furious
sea
in
the
second
place
if
all
three
are
still
swimming
it
will
be
almost
out
of
the
question
to
make
out
their
heads
among
the
huge
waves
you
none
of
you
seen
a
man
overboard
before
in
a
big
sea
several
of
the
mute
anxious
midshipmen
shook
their
heads
you
realize
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
within
the
next
few
minutes
remarked
the
lieutenant
i
am
sorry
to
crush
your
hopes
for
your
classmates
but
this
is
all
a
part
of
the
day
work
in
the
navy
the
largest
steam
launches
from
all
three
of
the
battleships
were
being
swiftly
lowered
officers
and
men
were
lowered
with
the
launches
as
the
launch
shoved
off
from
each
battleship
tremendous
cheers
followed
them
stop
all
unnecessary
noise
bellowed
the
watch
officer
from
the
bridge
of
the
massachusetts
you
may
drown
out
calls
for
help
with
your
racket
while
the
three
battleships
went
back
over
their
courses
in
more
stately
fashion
the
launches
darted
here
and
there
until
it
seemed
as
though
they
must
cover
every
foot
within
a
square
mile
i
do
see
how
they
can
help
finding
the
three
farley
declared
hopefully
that
is
put
in
another
third
classman
if
any
of
the
three
are
still
afloat
stow
all
talk
of
that
sort
ordered
farley
angrily
other
midshipmen
joined
in
with
their
protests
when
a
man
is
overboard
in
an
angry
sea
all
hands
left
behind
try
to
be
optimists
when
fifteen
minutes
had
been
spent
in
the
search
the
onlooking
but
helpless
middies
began
to
look
worried
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
some
of
them
looked
haggard
farley
face
was
pitiable
to
see
at
the
end
of
an
hour
of
constant
but
fruitless
searching
hardly
any
one
felt
any
hope
of
a
rescue
now
all
three
midshipmen
the
man
overboard
and
his
two
willing
rescuers
were
silently
conceded
to
be
drowned
yet
the
hardest
blow
of
all
came
when
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
quarter
the
flagship
signaled
the
recall
of
the
small
boats
then
indeed
all
hope
was
given
up
in
an
utter
human
silence
save
for
the
husky
voicing
of
the
necessary
orders
the
launches
were
hoisted
on
board
then
the
flagship
flew
the
signal
for
resuming
the
voyage
there
were
few
dry
eyes
among
the
third
class
midshipmen
when
the
battleships
fell
in
formation
again
and
proceeded
on
their
way
as
a
result
of
more
signals
flown
from
the
flagship
all
unnecessary
duties
of
midshipmen
for
the
day
were
ordered
suspended
in
the
afternoon
the
chaplain
on
each
battleship
held
funeral
services
over
the
three
lost
midshipmen
officers
middies
and
crew
attended
on
board
each
vessel
chapter
ix
the
despair
of
the
recall
dave
darrin
stood
within
ten
feet
of
hallam
when
that
latter
midshipman
had
lost
his
balance
and
fallen
into
the
boiling
sea
dave
spring
to
the
stern
rail
was
all
but
instantaneous
he
was
overboard
after
his
classmate
ere
the
marine
had
had
time
to
leap
to
the
life
buoys
out
of
the
corner
of
one
eye
dan
dalzell
saw
the
marine
start
on
the
jump
but
dan
was
overboard
also
too
soon
to
see
exactly
what
the
marine
sentry
was
doing
both
daring
midshipmen
sank
beneath
the
surface
as
they
struck
as
dan
came
up
however
his
hand
struck
something
solid
and
he
clutched
at
it
it
was
one
of
the
life
buoys
as
he
grasped
it
and
drew
his
head
up
a
trifle
dan
saw
another
floating
within
thirty
feet
of
him
swimming
hard
and
pushing
dan
succeeded
in
reaching
the
other
buoy
he
now
rested
holding
on
to
both
buoys
now
where
david
that
little
giant
muttered
dalzell
striving
hard
to
see
through
the
seething
waters
and
over
the
tops
of
waves
after
a
few
minutes
dan
began
to
feel
decidedly
nervous
yet
dave
ca
have
gone
down
for
he
a
better
swimmer
than
i
am
was
dan
consoling
thought
at
last
dalzell
caught
sight
of
another
head
he
could
have
cheered
but
he
expended
his
breath
on
something
more
sensible
dave
he
shouted
old
darry
this
way
i
have
the
life
buoys
at
the
same
time
holding
to
both
of
them
but
kicking
frantically
with
his
feet
dalzell
managed
slowly
to
push
the
buoys
toward
dave
soon
after
he
had
started
dan
did
utter
a
cheer
even
though
it
was
checked
by
an
inrush
of
salt
water
that
nearly
strangled
him
he
saw
two
heads
dave
darrin
was
coming
toward
him
helping
hallam
the
wind
carried
the
cheer
faintly
to
dave
he
raised
his
head
a
little
in
the
water
and
caught
sight
of
dan
and
the
buoys
some
three
minutes
it
took
the
two
chums
to
meet
dave
darrin
was
all
but
exhausted
for
hallam
was
now
unconscious
as
darrin
clutched
at
the
buoy
he
tried
to
shout
though
the
voice
came
weakly
catch
hold
of
hallam
i
down
and
but
dan
understood
even
before
he
heard
while
dave
clutched
at
one
of
the
life
buoys
dalzell
shot
out
an
arm
dragging
hallam
in
to
safety
now
it
was
darrin
who
with
both
arms
contrived
to
link
the
buoys
together
at
last
the
youngsters
had
a
chance
to
observe
the
fact
that
the
battleships
had
put
about
and
were
coming
back
we
soon
be
all
right
sighed
dave
contentedly
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
there
are
hundred
officers
middies
and
sailors
of
the
american
navy
to
look
after
our
safety
from
where
they
lay
as
they
hung
to
the
buoys
the
chums
could
even
see
the
launches
lowered
dan
with
some
of
the
emergency
lashing
about
the
buoy
succeeded
after
a
good
deal
of
effort
and
with
some
aid
from
dave
in
passing
a
cord
about
hallam
and
under
the
latter
armpits
that
secured
that
midshipman
to
one
of
the
buoys
the
next
move
of
the
chums
was
to
lash
the
buoys
together
now
declared
dave
we
ca
lose
we
can
hang
on
and
be
safe
here
for
hours
if
need
be
but
what
a
thundering
long
time
it
takes
them
to
bring
the
battleships
around
to
get
to
us
murmured
midshipman
dalzell
in
wonder
be
sure
not
an
unnecessary
second
has
been
lost
rejoined
dave
learning
something
practical
now
about
the
handling
of
big
craft
i
wonder
if
hally
a
goner
murmured
dan
in
an
voice
i
do
believe
it
dave
answered
promptly
once
we
get
him
back
aboard
ship
the
medicos
will
do
a
little
work
over
him
and
he
sit
up
and
want
to
know
if
dinner
ready
then
they
fell
silent
for
with
the
roar
of
wind
and
waters
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
shout
when
they
talked
as
the
minutes
went
by
slowly
the
two
conscious
midshipmen
found
themselves
filled
with
amazement
a
dozen
times
the
launches
darted
by
not
far
away
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
keen
restless
eyes
of
the
seekers
should
not
discover
the
imperiled
ones
at
such
times
dave
and
dan
shouted
with
all
the
power
of
their
lusty
young
lungs
alternately
dan
and
dave
tried
the
effect
of
rising
as
far
as
they
could
and
frantically
waving
an
arm
there
was
not
a
cap
to
wave
among
the
three
of
them
i
beginning
to
feel
discouraged
grunted
dave
in
disgust
at
last
they
must
have
spent
a
full
half
day
already
looking
for
us
merciful
powers
gasped
dan
at
last
as
they
rode
half
way
up
the
slope
of
a
big
wave
i
just
caught
sight
of
the
of
flying
from
the
flagship
no
gasped
dave
incredulously
yes
i
did
but
they
failed
and
have
given
up
the
search
spoke
dan
rather
despairingly
but
we
may
as
well
face
it
muttered
dan
brokenly
they
do
believe
that
any
of
us
has
survived
and
we
been
abandoned
then
spoke
dave
darrin
very
coolly
there
nothing
left
for
us
but
to
die
like
men
of
the
american
navy
it
seems
heartless
needless
protested
dan
no
broke
in
darrin
they
done
their
best
they
convinced
that
we
lost
and
i
should
think
they
would
be
after
all
the
time
searched
for
us
half
a
day
at
least
dan
said
nothing
but
tugged
until
he
succeeded
in
bringing
his
watch
up
to
the
light
the
blamed
thing
is
he
uttered
disgustedly
why
the
hands
point
to
less
than
half
past
nine
darrin
managed
to
get
at
his
own
watch
my
timepiece
does
call
for
half
past
nine
either
he
announced
can
it
be
possible
yes
the
time
has
only
seemed
longer
i
reckon
observed
dalzell
well
we
face
it
like
men
proposed
dave
of
course
nodded
dan
at
least
we
going
down
in
the
ocean
and
we
wear
the
american
naval
uniform
if
there
any
choice
in
deaths
i
guess
that
as
good
and
manly
a
one
as
we
could
choose
poor
old
hally
wo
know
much
about
it
anyway
i
guess
remarked
darrin
who
seemed
unnaturally
cool
possibly
he
was
a
bit
dazed
by
the
stunning
nature
of
the
fate
that
seemed
about
to
overtake
them
maybe
the
ships
will
go
by
us
in
their
final
proposed
dan
dalzell
very
soberly
not
if
i
seaman
enough
to
read
the
compass
by
what
visible
of
the
sun
returned
midshipman
darrin
then
there
no
help
for
it
answered
dan
choking
slightly
i
wonder
if
we
could
do
anything
for
hallam
we
wo
do
anything
to
bring
him
to
anyway
muttered
darrin
under
these
circumstances
i
would
do
anything
as
mean
as
that
to
a
dog
maybe
he
dead
already
anyway
proposed
dan
now
hopefully
i
hope
so
came
from
darrin
now
they
saw
the
not
very
distant
battleships
alter
their
courses
and
steam
slowly
away
all
was
now
desolation
over
the
angry
sea
as
the
battleships
gradually
vanished
the
two
conscious
midshipmen
were
now
resolved
to
face
the
end
bravely
that
was
all
they
could
do
for
themselves
and
their
flag
chapter
x
the
grim
watch
from
the
waves
by
the
time
that
little
more
than
the
mastheads
of
the
departing
battleships
were
visible
hallam
opened
his
eyes
it
would
have
seemed
a
vastly
kinder
fate
had
he
been
allowed
to
remain
unconscious
to
the
last
hallam
had
not
been
strangled
by
the
inrush
of
water
in
going
overboard
this
midshipman
had
struck
the
water
with
the
back
of
his
head
and
had
been
stunned
in
the
absence
of
attention
he
had
remained
a
long
time
unconscious
even
now
the
hapless
midshipman
whose
frollicking
had
been
the
cause
of
the
disaster
did
not
immediately
regain
his
full
senses
why
we
all
in
the
water
he
remarked
after
a
while
yes
assented
darrin
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
midshipman
hallam
remained
silent
for
some
moments
before
he
next
asked
how
did
it
happen
fell
overboard
replied
dan
laconically
failing
to
mention
who
it
was
who
had
fallen
over
the
stern
again
a
rather
long
silence
on
hallam
part
then
at
last
he
observed
funny
how
we
all
fell
over
at
the
same
time
to
this
neither
of
his
classmates
made
any
rejoinder
see
here
shouted
hallam
after
a
considerable
period
of
silent
wondering
i
remember
it
all
now
i
was
fooling
at
the
stern
rail
and
i
toppled
overboard
dan
nodded
without
words
and
you
fellows
jumped
in
after
me
roared
hallam
both
his
mental
and
bodily
powers
now
beginning
to
return
did
you
of
course
assented
darrin
rather
reluctantly
and
what
became
of
the
fleet
dave
and
dan
looked
at
each
other
before
the
former
replied
oh
well
hally
brace
up
the
ships
searched
for
us
a
long
time
and
some
launches
were
put
out
after
us
but
they
could
see
our
little
heads
above
the
big
waves
and
so
they
gone
away
and
left
us
queried
hallam
guessing
at
once
now
fellows
i
do
mind
so
much
for
myself
but
it
fearful
to
think
that
i
dragged
you
into
the
same
fate
it
awful
why
could
you
have
left
me
to
my
fate
would
you
have
done
a
thing
like
that
demanded
dave
dryly
oh
well
i
suppose
not
but
but
well
i
wish
i
had
been
left
to
pay
the
price
of
my
tomfoolery
all
alone
it
would
have
served
me
right
but
to
drag
you
two
into
it
hallam
could
go
no
further
he
was
choking
up
with
honest
emotion
do
bother
about
it
hally
urged
dave
it
all
in
the
day
work
for
a
sailor
we
just
take
it
as
it
comes
old
fellow
to
not
one
of
the
trio
did
it
occur
to
let
go
of
the
life
buoys
and
sink
as
a
means
of
ending
misery
in
the
first
place
human
instinct
holds
to
hope
in
the
second
place
suicide
is
the
resort
of
cowards
none
of
you
happened
to
hide
any
food
in
his
pockets
at
breakfast
i
take
it
asked
dan
grimly
at
last
of
course
they
had
too
bad
sighed
dan
i
growing
terribly
hungry
catch
a
fish
smiled
back
darrin
and
eat
it
raw
gasped
dalzell
darry
you
know
my
tastes
better
than
that
then
wait
a
few
hours
longer
proposed
dave
until
even
raw
fish
will
be
a
delicacy
hallam
took
no
part
in
the
chaffing
he
was
miserably
conscious
all
the
while
that
his
own
folly
had
been
solely
responsible
for
the
present
plight
of
these
noble
messmates
thus
the
time
passed
on
none
kept
any
track
of
it
they
realized
only
that
it
was
still
daylight
then
suddenly
dave
gave
a
gasp
and
raised
one
hand
to
point
his
two
classmates
turned
and
were
able
to
make
out
the
mastheads
of
a
craft
in
the
distance
how
they
strained
their
eyes
all
three
stared
and
stared
until
they
felt
tolerably
certain
that
the
craft
was
headed
their
way
they
may
see
us
cried
hallam
eagerly
three
battleships
and
as
many
launches
failed
to
find
us
retorted
dan
and
they
were
looking
for
us
too
as
the
vessel
came
nearer
and
the
hull
became
visible
it
took
on
the
appearance
of
a
liner
why
it
looks
as
though
she
run
right
over
us
when
she
gets
nearer
cried
dave
his
eyes
kindling
with
hope
do
get
too
excited
over
it
urged
dan
for
my
part
i
growing
almost
accustomed
to
disappointments
as
the
minutes
passed
and
the
liner
came
on
and
on
it
looked
still
more
as
though
she
would
run
down
the
three
middies
illustration
look
they
see
us
at
last
however
the
craft
was
passing
showing
her
port
side
not
very
far
distant
to
be
sure
uniting
their
voices
the
three
midshipmen
yelled
with
all
their
power
even
though
they
knew
that
their
desperate
call
for
help
could
not
carry
the
distance
over
the
subsiding
gale
boom
that
shot
came
from
the
liner
and
now
her
port
rail
was
black
with
people
they
see
us
cried
hallam
joyously
look
that
craft
is
slowing
up
once
more
came
the
cheers
of
encouragement
as
the
liner
now
some
distance
ahead
put
off
a
heavy
launch
a
masthead
lookout
who
had
first
seen
the
midshipmen
was
now
signaling
the
way
to
the
officer
in
command
of
the
launch
unable
to
see
for
himself
the
officer
in
the
launch
depended
wholly
on
those
masthead
signals
so
the
launch
steamed
a
somewhat
course
over
the
waves
yet
at
last
it
bore
down
straight
upon
the
midshipmen
darrin
dalzell
and
hallam
now
came
very
near
to
closing
their
eyes
to
lessen
the
suspense
a
short
time
more
and
all
three
were
dragged
in
over
the
sides
of
the
launch
get
those
life
buoys
in
if
you
can
begged
dave
as
he
sank
in
the
bottom
of
the
launch
they
are
united
states
property
entrusted
to
our
care
from
officer
and
seamen
alike
a
laugh
went
up
at
this
request
but
the
life
buoys
were
caught
with
a
boathook
and
drawn
aboard
what
rousing
cheers
greeted
the
returning
launch
from
the
decks
of
the
liner
princess
irene
when
the
three
midshipmen
reached
deck
and
it
was
learned
that
they
were
midshipmen
of
the
united
states
navy
the
cheering
and
interest
were
redoubled
but
the
captain
and
the
ship
doctor
cut
short
any
attempt
at
lionizing
by
rushing
the
midshipmen
to
a
stateroom
containing
three
berths
here
under
the
doctor
orders
the
trio
were
stripped
and
rubbed
down
then
they
were
rolled
into
blankets
and
hot
coffee
brought
to
them
in
their
berths
while
their
wet
clothing
was
sent
below
to
one
of
the
furnace
rooms
for
hurried
drying
as
soon
as
the
medical
man
had
examined
them
the
steamship
captain
began
to
question
them
headed
for
the
azores
eh
demanded
the
ship
master
we
ought
to
be
able
to
sight
your
squadron
before
long
he
hastened
out
to
give
orders
to
the
deck
officer
by
the
time
that
the
young
midshipmen
had
been
satisfactorily
warmed
and
their
clothing
had
been
dried
the
ship
surgeon
consented
to
their
dressing
after
this
they
were
led
to
a
private
cabin
where
a
satisfying
meal
was
served
them
oh
i
do
know
murmured
dan
leaning
back
with
a
contented
sigh
after
the
meal
was
over
there
are
worse
things
than
what
happened
to
us
the
greater
speed
of
the
liner
enabled
her
to
sight
the
battleship
squadron
something
more
than
two
hours
afterward
then
the
nearest
vessel
of
the
fleet
was
steered
for
directly
the
deck
officers
of
the
liner
sent
their
heavy
overcoats
for
the
use
of
the
midshipmen
who
enveloped
in
these
roomy
garments
went
out
on
deck
to
watch
the
pursuit
of
their
own
comrades
within
another
hour
it
was
possible
to
signal
and
from
the
princess
irene
masthead
the
signal
flags
were
broken
out
now
watch
for
excitement
on
board
your
own
craft
smiled
the
commander
an
englishman
as
soon
as
the
liner
signal
had
been
read
by
the
vessels
of
the
squadron
a
wild
display
of
signal
bunting
swiftly
broke
out
heaven
be
thanked
read
one
set
of
signal
flags
we
have
officially
buried
the
young
men
but
ask
them
to
go
on
living
read
another
while
the
most
practical
signal
of
all
was
the
will
fall
astern
of
the
squadron
kindly
stand
by
to
receive
her
launch
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
two
vessels
were
close
enough
both
stopped
headway
one
of
the
big
battleship
launches
put
off
and
steamed
over
rolling
and
pitching
on
the
waves
most
carefully
indeed
the
three
midshipmen
climbed
down
a
rope
ladder
and
were
received
by
an
ensign
from
the
massachusetts
who
next
gave
the
american
navy
profound
thanks
to
the
rescuers
of
the
middies
kindly
lower
that
united
states
property
that
was
in
our
care
sir
dave
darrin
called
up
there
was
laughter
above
and
a
look
of
amazement
on
ensign
white
face
until
the
two
buoys
attached
to
lines
were
thrown
down
over
the
side
when
your
time
comes
you
will
make
a
very
capable
officer
i
believe
darrin
judging
by
your
care
of
government
property
remarked
ensign
white
working
hard
to
keep
down
the
laughter
i
hope
to
do
so
sir
dave
replied
saluting
then
away
to
the
massachusetts
the
launch
bore
while
the
whole
battleship
squadron
cheered
itself
hoarse
over
the
happy
outcome
of
the
day
dave
dan
and
hallam
all
had
to
do
a
tremendous
amount
of
handshaking
among
their
classmates
when
they
had
reached
deck
pennington
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
come
forward
to
hold
his
hand
out
to
darrin
a
fact
that
was
noted
at
the
time
by
many
of
the
youngsters
to
the
captain
the
trio
recounted
what
had
befallen
them
as
matter
for
official
record
darrin
and
dalzell
announced
the
battleship
captain
i
must
commend
you
both
for
wholly
heroic
conduct
in
going
to
the
aid
of
your
classmate
and
darrin
i
am
particularly
interested
in
your
incidental
determination
to
preserve
government
property
the
life
buoys
that
you
brought
back
with
you
it
possible
i
may
need
them
again
sir
returned
dave
with
a
smile
though
he
had
no
notion
of
prophetic
utterance
chapter
xi
midshipman
pennington
accident
the
stop
at
the
azores
was
uneventful
it
remained
in
the
minds
of
the
midshipmen
only
as
a
pleasant
recollection
of
a
quaint
and
pretty
place
once
more
the
squadron
set
sail
and
now
the
pennant
was
flying
the
course
lay
straight
across
the
atlantic
to
the
entrance
of
chesapeake
bay
on
the
second
night
out
the
wind
was
blowing
a
little
less
than
half
a
gale
darkness
had
fallen
when
dave
dan
farley
and
several
other
midshipmen
gathered
to
talk
in
low
tones
at
the
stern
rail
presently
all
of
them
wandered
away
but
dave
he
stood
close
to
the
rail
enjoying
the
bumping
motion
every
time
the
descending
stern
hit
one
of
the
rolling
waves
presently
thinking
he
saw
a
light
astern
he
raised
himself
peering
astern
another
group
of
restless
middies
had
sauntered
up
pennington
after
a
swift
look
at
the
pacing
officer
in
charge
here
and
discovering
that
the
officer
back
was
turned
executed
a
series
of
swift
cartwheels
look
out
pen
called
midshipman
dwight
in
a
low
though
sharp
voice
just
too
late
the
warning
came
as
pen
leaped
to
his
feet
after
the
last
turn
one
of
his
hands
struck
darrin
forcefully
dave
swayed
tried
to
clutch
at
something
then
rang
the
first
startled
chorus
then
instantly
on
top
of
it
came
the
rousing
hail
man
overboard
astern
farley
and
hallam
were
the
first
to
reach
the
rail
but
lieutenant
burton
was
there
almost
as
quickly
haul
back
commanded
the
lieutenant
sternly
no
one
go
overboard
that
held
the
middies
in
check
for
in
no
place
more
than
in
the
navy
are
orders
orders
clack
was
the
sound
that
followed
the
first
cry
like
a
flash
the
marine
sentry
had
thrown
his
rifle
to
the
deck
a
single
bound
carried
him
to
one
of
the
night
life
buoys
this
he
released
and
hurled
far
astern
as
the
night
buoy
struck
the
water
a
red
light
was
fused
by
contact
the
glow
shone
out
over
the
waters
in
the
meantime
the
massachusetts
speed
was
being
slowed
rapidly
and
a
boat
crew
stood
at
quarters
the
boat
put
off
quickly
guided
by
the
glow
of
the
red
signal
light
on
the
buoy
ere
the
boat
reached
the
buoy
the
coxswain
made
out
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
young
man
above
the
rim
of
the
floating
buoy
soon
after
the
boat
lay
alongside
dave
with
the
coxswain
aid
pulled
himself
into
the
small
craft
recovering
the
buoy
the
coxswain
flashed
the
red
light
three
times
from
the
deck
of
the
battleship
came
a
cheering
yell
sent
up
from
hundreds
of
throats
in
the
meantime
however
while
the
boat
was
on
its
way
to
the
buoy
a
pulsing
scene
had
been
enacted
on
board
farley
went
straight
up
to
midshipman
pennington
sir
demanded
farley
hotly
why
did
you
push
darrin
over
the
rail
pennington
looked
at
his
questioner
as
one
stunned
i
i
did
push
darrin
over
admitted
pennington
but
it
was
an
accident
an
easily
contrived
one
was
it
demanded
midshipman
farley
rather
cynically
it
was
pure
accident
contended
pennington
paling
until
it
happened
i
had
the
least
idea
in
the
world
that
i
was
going
to
send
darrin
or
anyone
else
overboard
huh
returned
farley
dubiously
huh
quoth
hallam
dan
dalzell
uttered
not
a
word
but
the
gaze
of
his
eyes
was
fixed
angrily
on
pennington
that
latter
midshipman
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
his
hands
worked
as
though
he
were
attempting
to
clutch
at
something
to
hold
himself
up
surely
you
fellows
do
believe
do
you
he
stammered
weakly
then
paused
one
thing
we
did
notice
the
other
day
continued
farley
briskly
was
that
when
darrin
was
rescued
from
the
sea
and
returned
to
us
you
were
about
the
only
member
of
the
class
who
did
go
up
to
him
and
congratulate
him
on
his
marvelous
escape
how
could
pennington
i
have
the
patience
to
talk
with
you
now
rejoined
farley
turning
on
his
heel
at
that
moment
the
yell
started
among
the
midshipmen
nearer
the
rail
farley
dan
hallam
and
others
joined
in
the
yell
and
rushed
to
better
points
of
vantage
pennington
tried
to
join
in
the
cheer
but
his
tongue
seemed
fixed
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
he
stood
clenching
and
unclenching
his
hands
his
face
an
ashen
gray
in
his
deep
humiliation
i
do
care
what
one
or
two
fellows
may
say
groaned
pennington
but
i
do
want
the
class
to
think
such
things
of
me
he
was
the
most
miserable
man
on
board
as
the
small
boat
came
alongside
the
boat
occupants
and
all
was
hoisted
up
to
the
davits
and
swung
to
the
officer
of
the
deck
who
stood
dave
turned
with
a
brisk
salute
i
beg
to
report
that
i
come
aboard
sir
darrin
uttered
and
very
glad
we
are
of
it
darrin
replied
the
officer
you
will
go
to
your
locker
change
your
clothing
and
then
report
to
the
captain
sir
aye
aye
sir
with
another
salute
dave
hastened
below
followed
by
dan
dalzell
who
was
intent
on
attending
him
ten
minutes
later
dave
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
captain
cabin
just
a
few
minutes
after
that
he
came
out
on
deck
a
crowd
gathered
about
him
expressing
their
congratulations
thank
you
all
laughed
dave
but
do
make
so
much
over
a
middy
getting
a
bath
outside
of
the
schedule
to
the
rear
hung
pennington
waiting
his
chance
at
last
as
the
crowd
thinned
pennington
made
his
way
up
to
dave
darrin
i
have
to
apologize
for
my
nonsense
which
was
the
means
of
pushing
you
overboard
it
was
purely
accidental
on
my
honor
i
did
not
even
know
it
was
you
at
the
stern
nor
did
i
realize
that
my
antics
would
result
in
pushing
any
one
overboard
i
trust
you
will
do
me
the
honor
of
believing
my
statement
of
course
i
believe
it
pennington
answered
darrin
opening
his
eyes
there
are
some
continued
pennington
who
have
intimated
to
me
their
belief
that
i
did
it
on
purpose
there
may
be
others
who
half
believe
or
suspect
that
i
might
or
would
do
such
a
thing
nonsense
retorted
dave
promptly
there
may
be
differences
sometimes
between
classmates
but
there
is
a
midshipman
in
the
navy
who
would
deliberately
try
to
drown
a
comrade
it
a
preposterous
insult
against
midshipman
honor
if
i
hear
any
one
make
a
charge
like
that
i
call
him
out
promptly
some
of
your
friends
i
wo
name
them
insisted
or
at
least
let
me
feel
the
force
of
their
suspicions
if
any
of
my
friends
hinted
at
such
a
thing
it
was
done
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
replied
dave
heartily
why
pennington
such
an
act
of
dishonor
is
impossible
to
a
man
bred
at
annapolis
darrin
fully
believed
what
he
said
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
held
out
his
hand
to
his
enemy
pennington
flushed
deeply
for
a
moment
then
put
out
his
own
hand
giving
dave
a
hearty
straightforward
grasp
i
was
the
first
to
imply
the
charge
broke
in
farley
quickly
i
withdraw
it
and
apologize
to
both
of
you
there
was
more
handshaking
during
the
next
few
days
while
darry
and
pen
did
not
become
by
any
means
intimate
they
no
longer
made
any
effort
to
avoid
each
other
but
spoke
frankly
when
they
met
the
remaining
days
of
the
voyage
passed
uneventfully
enough
except
for
a
great
amount
of
hard
work
that
the
middies
performed
as
usual
on
the
of
august
they
entered
chesapeake
bay
once
well
inside
they
came
to
anchor
there
was
considerable
practice
with
the
and
other
smaller
guns
on
the
of
august
the
battleship
fleet
returned
to
the
familiar
waters
around
annapolis
the
day
after
that
the
young
men
disembarked
then
came
a
hurried
skeltering
for
the
first
second
and
third
classmen
were
entitled
to
leave
during
the
month
of
september
chapter
xii
back
in
the
home
town
back
in
the
old
streets
of
their
home
town
gridley
dave
and
dan
enjoying
every
minute
of
their
month
leave
had
already
greeted
their
parents
and
had
told
them
much
of
their
life
as
midshipmen
what
hurt
was
the
fact
that
the
skipper
of
the
princess
irene
had
already
told
the
marine
reporters
in
new
york
the
thrilling
story
of
how
dave
and
dan
had
nearly
come
to
their
own
deaths
rescuing
midshipman
hallam
everyone
in
gridley
it
seemed
had
read
that
newspaper
story
darrin
and
dalzell
before
they
had
been
home
twelve
hours
were
weary
of
hearing
their
praises
sung
there
go
two
of
the
smartest
finest
boys
that
old
gridley
ever
turned
out
citizens
would
say
pointing
after
dave
and
dan
midshipmen
at
annapolis
going
to
be
officers
of
the
navy
one
of
these
days
but
what
the
matter
with
dick
prescott
and
greg
holmes
they
at
west
point
oh
they
all
right
too
of
course
but
darrin
and
dalzell
it
was
the
old
circumstance
of
being
the
lions
of
the
minute
and
of
being
on
the
spot
on
the
first
morning
of
his
arrival
home
dave
darrin
went
frankly
and
openly
to
call
on
his
old
schoolgirl
sweetheart
belle
meade
dan
having
no
particular
associations
with
the
gentler
sex
took
a
stroll
around
town
to
meet
any
old
friends
who
might
care
to
see
him
again
dave
was
shown
into
the
parlor
at
the
meade
home
soon
after
belle
came
swiftly
in
her
face
beaming
with
delight
oh
but
you
not
in
uniform
was
her
first
disappointed
comment
no
smiled
dave
i
allowed
every
possible
chance
for
one
month
to
forget
every
detail
of
the
big
grind
which
for
a
short
time
i
left
behind
but
you
the
same
old
dave
cried
belle
only
bigger
and
manlier
and
that
magnificent
work
you
and
dan
did
in
jumping
stop
begged
dave
you
a
friend
of
mine
are
you
then
add
to
the
pain
that
has
been
already
inflicted
on
me
if
i
had
had
the
newspapers
in
mind
i
would
have
the
nerve
to
but
please
let
not
talk
about
it
anymore
then
the
two
young
people
seated
themselves
and
spent
a
delightful
hour
in
talking
over
all
that
had
befallen
them
both
since
they
had
last
met
belle
too
through
laura
bentley
had
some
much
later
news
of
the
old
chums
dick
and
greg
now
cadets
at
west
point
this
news
however
will
be
found
in
full
in
dick
prescott
second
year
at
west
point
what
are
your
plans
for
this
afternoon
belle
asked
at
last
that
what
i
want
your
help
in
making
dave
answered
can
you
get
hold
of
dan
no
trouble
about
that
but
keeping
hold
of
him
may
be
more
difficult
laughed
dave
i
was
going
to
propose
that
you
get
dan
call
here
and
then
we
all
go
over
to
laura
bentley
i
know
she
be
anxious
to
see
us
nothing
could
be
better
in
the
way
of
a
plan
assented
dave
i
pin
danny
boy
down
to
that
it
would
really
seem
like
a
slight
on
good
old
dick
if
we
did
make
laura
an
early
call
i
go
to
the
telephone
now
and
tell
her
that
we
coming
cried
belle
rising
quickly
laura
is
delighted
she
reported
on
her
return
to
the
room
but
dave
did
you
at
least
bring
along
a
uniform
so
that
we
could
see
what
it
looks
like
i
did
replied
dave
soberly
then
added
quizzically
you
seen
the
district
messenger
boys
on
the
street
have
you
yes
of
course
but
what
our
uniforms
look
very
much
like
theirs
declared
dave
i
afraid
i
ca
undertake
to
believe
you
belle
pouted
well
anyway
you
girls
will
soon
have
a
chance
to
see
our
uniforms
just
as
soon
as
our
hops
start
this
fall
you
and
laura
will
come
down
and
gladden
our
hearts
by
letting
us
drag
you
wo
you
drag
us
repeated
belle
much
mystified
oh
that
middies
slang
for
escorting
a
pretty
girl
to
a
midshipman
hop
you
have
a
lot
of
slang
then
i
suppose
considerable
admitted
dave
readily
what
then
is
your
slang
for
a
pretty
girl
oh
we
call
her
a
queen
and
a
girl
who
is
who
is
pretty
a
gold
brick
answered
dave
unblushingly
a
gold
brick
gasped
belle
dear
me
a
gold
brick
to
a
hop
does
sound
romantic
does
it
it
is
darrin
admitted
yet
you
have
invited
me
our
class
has
started
in
with
its
course
of
social
compliments
yet
laughed
dave
please
go
look
in
the
glass
or
if
you
wo
believe
the
glass
then
just
wait
and
see
how
proud
dan
and
i
are
if
we
can
lead
you
and
laura
out
on
the
dancing
floor
but
what
horrid
slang
protested
belle
the
idea
of
calling
a
homely
girl
a
gold
brick
and
i
thought
you
young
men
received
more
or
less
training
in
being
gracious
to
the
weaker
sex
we
do
dave
answered
as
soon
as
we
can
find
any
use
for
the
accomplishment
fourth
classmen
you
know
are
considered
too
young
to
associate
with
girls
it
only
now
when
we
made
a
start
in
the
third
class
that
we
to
be
allowed
to
attend
the
hops
at
all
but
why
must
you
have
to
have
such
horrid
names
for
girls
who
have
not
been
greatly
favored
in
the
way
of
looks
it
does
sound
exactly
gallant
oh
well
you
know
laughed
dave
we
poor
despised
middies
must
have
some
sort
of
sincere
language
to
talk
after
we
get
our
masks
off
for
the
day
i
suppose
we
like
the
privilege
for
a
few
minutes
in
each
day
of
being
fresh
like
other
young
folks
what
is
your
name
for
down
at
annapolis
belle
wanted
to
know
touge
and
for
being
a
bit
worse
than
touge
ratey
which
did
they
call
you
demanded
belle
dave
started
then
sat
up
straight
staring
at
miss
meade
i
see
that
your
tongue
has
lost
its
old
incisiveness
he
laughed
not
among
my
friends
belle
replied
lightly
but
i
ca
get
my
mind
off
that
uniform
of
yours
that
you
did
bring
home
what
would
have
happened
to
you
if
you
had
been
bold
enough
to
do
it
i
guess
i
have
the
pap
hazarded
dave
and
what
on
earth
is
the
pap
gasped
belle
oh
that
a
brief
way
of
telling
about
it
when
a
midshipman
gets
stuck
on
the
conduct
report
i
going
to
buy
a
notebook
asserted
belle
and
write
down
and
classify
some
of
this
jargon
i
hate
to
visit
a
strange
country
like
annapolis
and
find
i
did
know
the
language
and
dave
what
sort
of
place
is
annapolis
anyway
oh
it
a
suburb
of
the
naval
academy
dave
answered
is
it
dreadfully
hard
to
keep
one
place
in
his
class
there
asked
belle
well
the
average
fellow
is
satisfied
if
he
does
cold
dave
informed
her
gracious
what
sort
of
explosion
is
cold
why
that
means
getting
down
pretty
close
to
absolute
zero
in
all
studies
when
a
fellow
has
the
hard
luck
to
bust
cold
the
superintendent
allows
him
all
his
time
thereafter
to
go
home
and
look
up
a
more
suitable
job
than
one
in
the
navy
and
when
a
fellow
bilges
stop
begged
belle
wait
she
fled
from
the
room
to
return
presently
bearing
the
prettiest
hat
that
dave
ever
remembered
having
seen
on
her
shapely
young
head
in
one
hand
she
carried
a
dainty
parasol
that
she
turned
over
to
him
what
the
cruise
asked
darrin
rising
i
going
out
to
get
that
notebook
now
please
do
talk
any
more
to
me
until
i
get
a
chance
to
set
the
jargon
down
as
she
stood
there
such
a
pretty
and
wholesome
picture
david
darrin
thought
he
never
before
had
seen
such
a
pretty
girl
nor
one
dressed
in
such
exquisite
taste
being
a
boy
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
belle
meade
had
been
engaged
for
weeks
in
designing
this
gown
and
others
that
she
meant
to
wear
during
his
brief
stay
at
home
what
are
you
thinking
of
asked
belle
what
a
pity
it
is
that
i
am
doomed
to
a
short
life
sighed
darrin
a
short
life
what
do
you
mean
belle
asked
why
i
going
to
be
assassinated
the
first
hop
that
you
attend
at
the
naval
academy
so
i
a
gold
brick
am
i
frowned
belle
you
a
gold
brick
stammered
dave
why
you
oh
go
look
in
the
glass
who
will
assassinate
you
a
committee
made
up
from
among
the
fellows
whose
names
i
do
write
down
on
your
dance
card
and
there
are
hundreds
of
them
at
annapolis
you
ca
dance
with
them
all
i
do
intend
to
replied
belle
with
a
toss
of
her
head
accept
as
partners
only
those
who
appear
to
me
the
handsomest
and
most
distinguished
looking
of
the
midshipmen
no
one
else
can
write
his
name
on
my
card
dear
girl
i
afraid
you
do
understand
our
way
of
making
up
dance
cards
at
crabtown
where
crabtown
that
our
local
name
for
annapolis
gracious
let
me
get
out
quickly
and
get
that
notebook
at
midshipmen
hops
the
fellow
who
drags
the
gold
brick
supplied
belle
resignedly
no
not
for
worlds
you
no
gold
brick
belle
and
you
know
it
even
though
you
do
refuse
to
go
to
the
mirror
but
the
fellow
who
drags
any
femme
please
stands
for
girl
the
fellow
who
drags
any
femme
makes
up
her
dance
card
for
her
and
she
has
a
word
to
say
about
it
not
as
a
rule
oh
cried
belle
dramatically
she
moved
toward
the
door
dave
who
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
pretty
face
managed
somehow
to
delay
her
belle
there
something
he
began
good
gracious
where
what
she
cried
looking
about
her
keenly
it
something
i
want
to
say
must
say
dave
went
on
with
more
of
an
effort
than
anyone
but
himself
could
guess
tell
me
as
we
going
down
the
street
invited
belle
choked
dave
well
i
guess
not
he
faced
her
resting
both
hands
lightly
on
her
shoulders
belle
we
were
pretty
near
sweethearts
in
the
high
school
i
think
he
went
on
huskily
but
looking
her
straight
in
the
eyes
at
least
that
was
my
hope
and
i
hope
most
earnestly
that
it
going
to
continue
belle
i
am
a
long
way
from
my
real
career
yet
it
will
be
five
years
yet
before
i
have
any
right
to
marry
but
i
want
to
look
forward
all
the
time
to
the
sweet
belief
that
my
schoolgirl
sweetheart
is
going
to
become
my
wife
one
of
these
days
i
want
that
as
a
goal
to
work
for
along
with
my
commission
in
the
navy
but
to
this
much
i
agree
if
you
say
now
and
find
later
that
you
have
made
a
mistake
you
will
tell
me
so
frankly
poor
boy
murmured
belle
looking
at
him
fully
you
been
a
plebe
until
lately
and
you
have
been
allowed
to
see
any
girls
i
not
going
to
take
advantage
of
you
as
heartlessly
as
that
yet
something
in
her
eyes
gave
the
midshipman
hope
belle
he
continued
eagerly
do
trifle
with
me
tell
me
will
you
marry
me
some
day
then
there
was
a
little
more
talk
and
well
it
no
one
business
but
we
not
so
formally
engaged
belle
warned
him
that
you
write
me
and
draw
out
of
the
snare
if
you
wish
when
you
older
and
i
not
going
to
wear
any
ring
until
you
graduated
from
the
naval
academy
do
you
understand
that
david
darrin
it
shall
be
as
you
say
either
way
dave
replied
happily
and
now
let
us
get
started
or
we
sha
get
out
on
the
street
urged
belle
then
they
passed
out
on
the
street
and
no
ordinarily
observant
person
would
have
suspected
them
of
being
anything
more
than
school
friends
being
very
in
some
respects
belle
first
move
was
to
go
to
a
stationer
where
she
bought
a
little
notebook
bound
in
red
leather
dave
tried
to
pay
for
that
purchase
but
belle
forestalled
him
why
did
you
allow
me
to
make
you
that
little
gift
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
when
they
had
reached
the
street
wait
replied
belle
archly
some
day
you
may
find
your
hands
full
in
that
line
one
of
my
instructors
at
annapolis
complimented
me
on
having
very
capable
hands
dave
told
her
dryly
the
instructor
in
boxing
asked
belle
it
was
a
wonderfully
delightful
stroll
that
the
middy
and
his
sweetheart
enjoyed
that
september
forenoon
once
dave
sighed
so
pronouncedly
that
belle
shot
a
quick
look
of
questioning
at
him
tired
of
our
understanding
already
she
demanded
no
i
was
thinking
how
sorry
i
am
for
danny
boy
he
does
know
the
happiness
of
having
a
real
sweetheart
how
do
you
know
he
does
asked
belle
quickly
does
he
tell
you
everything
no
but
i
know
danny
lines
pretty
well
i
suspect
at
least
if
he
had
a
sweetheart
are
you
sure
that
you
would
oh
yes
by
gracious
there
danny
going
around
the
corner
above
at
this
very
moment
belle
had
looked
in
the
same
instant
yes
and
a
skirt
swished
around
the
corner
with
him
declared
belle
impressively
it
would
be
funny
would
it
if
you
did
happen
to
know
all
about
dan
dalzell
in
the
early
afternoon
however
the
mystery
was
cleared
up
on
the
street
dalzell
had
encountered
laura
bentley
both
were
full
of
talk
and
questions
concerning
dick
prescott
and
greg
holmes
at
west
point
for
which
reason
dan
had
strolled
home
with
miss
bentley
without
any
other
thought
on
the
midshipman
part
than
playing
substitute
gallant
for
his
chum
cadet
richard
prescott
military
academy
a
most
delightful
afternoon
the
four
young
people
spent
together
at
the
bentley
home
these
were
the
forerunners
of
other
afternoons
belle
and
laura
however
were
not
able
to
keep
their
midshipmen
to
themselves
other
girls
former
students
at
the
high
school
arranged
a
series
of
affairs
to
which
the
four
young
people
were
invited
dave
happiest
moments
were
when
he
had
belle
to
himself
for
a
stroll
or
chat
dan
happiest
moments
on
the
other
hand
were
when
he
was
engaged
in
hunting
the
old
high
school
fellows
or
such
of
them
as
were
now
at
home
for
many
of
them
had
entered
colleges
or
technical
schools
tom
reade
and
harry
hazelton
of
the
famous
old
dick
of
high
school
days
were
now
in
the
far
southwest
under
circumstances
fully
narrated
in
the
young
engineers
in
arizona
the
second
volume
of
the
young
engineers
series
day
by
day
belle
jotted
down
in
her
notebook
more
specimens
of
midshipman
slang
i
shall
soon
feel
that
i
can
reel
off
the
language
like
a
native
of
crabtown
she
confided
laughingly
to
dare
it
wo
be
very
long
before
you
have
an
opportunity
to
try
dave
declared
if
you
and
laura
embrace
your
first
opportunity
to
come
to
a
middy
hop
dan
had
a
happy
enough
time
of
it
even
though
dave
suspicion
was
true
in
that
dan
had
no
sweetheart
that
however
was
dan
fault
entirely
as
several
of
the
former
high
school
girls
would
have
been
willing
to
assure
him
since
even
the
happiest
times
must
all
end
so
the
latter
part
of
september
drew
near
then
came
the
day
when
dave
and
dan
met
at
the
railway
station
a
host
of
others
were
there
to
see
them
off
for
the
midshipmen
still
had
crowds
of
friends
in
the
good
old
home
town
a
ringing
of
bells
signaling
brakesmen
a
rolling
of
steel
wheels
and
the
two
young
midshipmen
swung
aboard
the
train
to
wave
their
hats
from
the
platform
gridley
was
gone
lost
to
sight
for
another
year
dan
was
exuberant
during
the
first
hour
of
the
journey
dave
unusually
silent
you
need
a
vast
amount
of
cheering
up
david
little
giant
exclaimed
dalzell
oh
i
guess
not
smiled
dave
darrin
quietly
adding
to
himself
under
his
breath
i
carry
my
own
good
cheer
with
me
now
lightly
his
hand
touched
a
breast
pocket
that
carried
the
latest
sweetest
likeness
of
miss
belle
meade
one
journey
by
rail
is
much
like
another
to
the
traveler
who
pays
little
heed
to
the
scenery
at
the
journey
end
two
midshipmen
joined
the
throng
of
others
at
crabtown
chapter
xiii
dan
receives
a
fearful
facer
oh
you
heap
sighed
dan
dalzell
dismally
he
sat
in
his
chair
in
their
new
quarters
in
bancroft
hall
united
states
naval
academy
gazing
in
mock
despair
at
the
pile
of
new
books
that
he
had
just
drawn
these
contained
the
subjects
in
which
a
midshipman
is
required
to
qualify
in
his
second
academic
year
been
through
the
books
for
a
first
look
called
dave
from
behind
his
own
study
table
some
of
admitted
dalzell
i
afraid
to
glance
into
the
others
i
looked
in
all
of
my
books
continued
darrin
and
i
just
come
to
a
startling
conclusion
what
i
inclined
to
believe
that
i
have
received
a
complete
set
of
for
the
first
and
second
classes
no
such
luck
grunted
dan
getting
up
and
going
over
to
his
chum
let
me
see
if
you
got
all
the
books
i
did
before
dave
could
prevent
it
dan
started
a
determined
of
the
book
pile
as
he
did
so
dan
suddenly
uncovered
a
photograph
from
which
a
fair
sweet
laughing
face
gazed
up
at
him
oh
i
beg
a
million
pardons
dave
old
boy
cried
dalzell
you
need
came
dave
frank
answer
i
proud
of
that
treasure
and
of
all
it
means
to
me
and
i
glad
for
you
david
little
giant
their
hands
met
in
hearty
clasp
and
that
was
all
that
was
said
on
that
subject
at
the
time
but
seriously
dan
grumbled
on
after
a
while
i
aghast
at
what
an
exacting
government
expects
and
demands
that
we
shall
know
just
look
over
the
list
mechanical
drawing
and
mechanical
processes
analytical
geometry
calculus
physics
chemistry
english
literature
french
and
spanish
integral
calculus
spherical
trigonometry

and
united

naval

david
my
boy
by
the
end
of
this
year
we
know
more
than
college
professors
do
are
you
getting
a
big
head
danny
queried
darrin
looking
up
with
a
smile
i
am
assented
dalzell
and
i
admit
it
why
man
alive
one
has
to
have
a
big
head
here
no
small
head
would
contain
all
that
the
academic
board
insists
on
crowding
into
it
by
the
time
that
the
chums
had
attended
the
first
section
recitations
on
the
following
day
their
despair
was
increased
davy
i
do
see
how
we
are
ever
going
to
make
it
this
year
dalzell
gasped
while
they
were
making
ready
for
supper
formation
we
bilge
this
year
without
a
doubt
there
only
one
reason
i
see
for
hoping
that
we
can
get
through
the
year
with
fair
credit
murmured
darrin
and
what
that
others
have
done
it
before
us
and
many
more
are
going
to
do
it
this
year
replied
dave
slowly
as
he
laid
comb
and
brush
away
and
drew
on
his
uniform
blouse
i
know
men
have
gotten
through
the
naval
academy
in
years
gone
by
dalzell
agreed
but
the
first
chance
that
i
have
i
going
to
look
the
matter
up
and
see
whether
the
middies
of
old
had
any
such
fearful
grind
as
we
have
our
noses
held
to
oh
we
do
it
declared
darrin
confidently
i
shall
anyway
for
i
got
to
as
he
spoke
he
was
thinking
of
belle
meade
and
of
her
prospects
in
life
as
well
as
his
own
as
the
days
went
by
however
dave
and
dan
became
more
and
more
dull
of
spirits
the
grind
was
a
fearful
one
a
few
very
bright
youngsters
went
along
all
right
but
to
most
of
the
third
classmen
graduation
began
to
look
a
thousand
years
away
the
football
squad
was
out
now
and
training
in
deadly
earnest
there
were
many
big
games
to
be
played
but
most
of
all
the
middies
longed
to
tow
west
point
army
eleven
into
the
port
of
defeat
in
their
first
year
dave
and
dan
had
looked
forward
longingly
to
joining
the
gridiron
squad
they
had
even
practised
somewhat
but
now
they
realized
that
playing
football
in
the
second
year
at
annapolis
must
be
for
them
merely
a
foolish
dream
i
thankful
enough
if
i
can
study
day
and
night
and
keep
myself
up
to
confessed
darrin
as
he
and
dan
chatted
over
their
gridiron
longings
tenths
is
the
lowest
marking
on
a
scale
of
four
that
will
suffice
to
keep
a
midshipman
in
the
naval
academy
i
not
going
to
reach
in
some
studies
this
month
groaned
dan
i
know
that
much
by
way
of
advance
information
the
fates
be
thanked
that
we
allowed
until
the
to
pick
up
but
the
question
is
are
we
ever
going
to
pick
up
as
i
look
through
my
books
it
seems
to
me
that
every
succeeding
lesson
is
twice
as
hard
as
the
one
before
it
other
men
have
gone
through
every
year
and
still
other
men
have
been
dropped
every
year
dalzell
dolefully
reminded
him
we
among
those
who
are
going
to
stay
dave
contended
stubbornly
then
i
afraid
we
be
among
those
who
are
dropped
after
christmas
and
come
back
next
year
as
bilgers
dalzell
groaned
now
drop
that
commanded
darrin
almost
roughly
remember
one
thing
daniel
little
lion
slayer
my
congressman
and
your
senator
wo
appoint
us
again
if
we
fail
now
no
talk
of
that
kind
remember
we
got
to
make
our
standing
secure
within
the
next
few
weeks
before
the
month
was
over
the
football
games
began
in
earnest
on
the
athletic
field
darrin
and
dalzell
however
missed
every
game
they
were
too
busy
poring
over
their
fortunately
for
them
their
drills
parades
and
gym
work
furnished
them
enough
exercise
the
end
of
october
found
darrin
at
or
above
in
only
three
studies
dan
was
above
in
two
studies
below
that
mark
in
all
others
it
a
pity
my
father
never
taught
me
to
swear
grumbled
dalzell
in
the
privacy
of
their
room
stow
that
talk
ordered
darrin
and
shove
off
into
the
deeper
waters
of
greater
effort
greater
effort
demanded
dan
in
a
rage
why
i
study
now
every
possible
moment
of
the
time
allowed
for
such
foolishness
and
we
run
a
light
right
after
taps
the
electric
light
is
turned
off
at
the
master
switch
we
wasting
ninety
seconds
of
precious
time
now
in
grumbling
uttered
dave
seating
himself
doggedly
at
his
study
table
got
any
money
darry
asked
dalzell
suddenly
yes
are
you
broke
i
am
and
the
next
time
i
go
into
annapolis
i
mean
to
buy
some
candles
do
try
that
danny
running
a
light
is
dangerous
and
doubly
so
with
candles
the
grease
is
bound
to
drip
and
to
be
found
in
some
little
corner
by
one
of
the
discipline
officers
it
would
be
no
use
to
study
if
you
are
going
to
get
frapped
on
the
pap
continuously
immediately
after
supper
both
midshipmen
forfeited
their
few
minutes
of
recreation
going
at
once
back
to
their
study
tables
there
they
remained
boning
hard
until
the
brief
release
sounded
before
taps
was
due
almost
at
the
sound
of
the
release
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
farley
and
his
roommate
page
came
bounding
in
i
got
to
say
something
or
i
go
daffy
cried
farley
rubbing
his
eyes
fellows
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
downright
abuse
as
the
second
year
course
of
studies
means
it
is
tough
agreed
dave
but
what
can
we
do
about
it
except
fight
it
out
can
you
make
head
or
tail
out
of
calculus
demanded
farley
no
admitted
darrin
but
i
hope
to
one
of
these
days
just
then
freeman
of
the
first
class
poked
his
head
in
after
a
soft
knock
what
is
this
a
despair
meeting
he
called
cheerily
yes
groaned
page
we
in
a
blue
funk
over
the
way
recitations
are
going
oh
buck
up
kiddies
called
freeman
cheerily
as
he
crossed
the
floor
youngsters
always
get
in
the
doldrums
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
you
a
first
classman
when
you
were
in
the
third
class
did
you
have
all
the
studies
that
we
have
now
every
one
of
them
sir
affirmed
midshipman
freeman
gravely
though
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
and
did
you
come
through
the
course
easily
asked
page
not
easily
admitted
the
first
classman
there
is
anything
at
annapolis
that
is
easy
except
the
dancing
in
fact
during
the
first
two
months
very
few
of
our
class
came
along
like
anything
at
all
after
that
we
began
to
do
better
by
the
time
that
came
around
nearly
all
of
us
managed
to
pull
through
but
what
seems
to
be
the
worst
grind
of
all
the
real
blue
paint
calculus
cried
the
four
youngsters
in
unison
why
once
you
begin
to
see
daylight
in
calculus
it
just
as
easy
as
taking
a
nap
declared
the
first
classman
at
present
it
seems
more
like
suffering
from
delirium
sighed
dave
what
the
hard
one
for
asked
freeman
here
it
is
right
here
continued
dave
opening
his
the
very
proposition
the
others
crowded
about
nodding
i
remember
that
one
laughed
freeman
lightly
our
class
named
it
fly
paper
it
was
rightly
named
grumbled
farley
none
of
you
four
youngsters
see
through
it
demanded
midshipman
freeman
do
you
mean
to
claim
sir
that
you
ever
did
insisted
dan
dalzell
not
only
once
but
now
grinned
freeman
you
have
been
looking
at
this
torturing
proposition
from
the
right
angle
that
all
now
listen
while
i
read
it
oh
we
all
know
how
it
runs
freeman
protested
page
nevertheless
listen
while
i
read
it
as
the
first
classman
read
through
the
proposition
that
was
torturing
them
he
threw
an
emphasis
upon
certain
words
that
opened
their
eyes
better
as
to
the
meaning
now
it
works
out
this
way
continued
the
first
classman
bending
over
the
disk
and
drawing
paper
and
pencil
toward
him
in
the
first
place
freeman
seemed
to
these
youngsters
like
a
born
demonstrator
within
five
minutes
he
had
made
the
sticky
fly
paper
problem
so
plain
to
them
all
that
they
glanced
from
one
to
another
in
astonishment
why
it
does
seem
easy
confessed
farley
it
sounds
foolish
now
grinned
darrin
i
beginning
to
feel
ashamed
of
myself
freeman
protested
page
you
saved
us
from
suicide
or
some
other
gruesome
fate
then
i
drop
in
once
in
a
while
again
promised
the
first
classman
but
that
will
take
time
from
your
own
studies
remonstrated
darrin
generously
not
in
the
least
i
wo
come
around
before
release
by
the
time
a
fellow
reaches
the
first
class
if
he
going
to
graduate
anyway
he
does
have
to
study
as
hard
as
a
youngster
does
the
man
who
reaches
the
first
class
has
had
all
the
habits
of
true
study
ground
into
him
darrin
dalzell
farley
and
page
were
all
in
different
sections
in
mathematics
when
they
recited
next
day
it
so
happened
that
each
was
the
man
to
have
the
sticky
fly
paper
problem
assigned
to
him
by
the
instructor
each
of
the
quartette
received
a
full
for
the
marking
did
you
have
any
assistance
with
this
problem
mr
darrin
asked
dave
instructor
yes
sir
a
member
of
the
first
class
tried
to
make
it
plain
to
me
last
night
he
appears
to
have
succeeded
remarked
the
instructor
dryly
there
was
however
no
discredit
attached
to
having
received
proper
assistance
before
coming
into
section
true
to
his
promise
freeman
dropped
in
every
fourth
or
fifth
evening
to
see
if
he
could
be
of
any
help
to
the
four
youngsters
always
he
found
that
he
could
be
even
when
thanksgiving
came
dave
darrin
did
not
go
to
philadelphia
but
remained
at
the
academy
devoting
his
time
to
study
dan
in
sheer
desperation
took
in
the
trip
to
philadelphia
he
hoped
to
meet
dick
prescott
and
greg
holmes
but
they
did
not
come
down
from
west
point
on
the
first
day
of
december
dan
dalzell
name
was
formally
reported
by
the
academic
board
in
a
report
to
the
superintendent
which
recommended
that
midshipman
dalzell
be
dropped
from
the
rolls
for
inaptitude
in
his
studies
poor
dan
it
was
a
staggering
blow
yet
it
struck
dave
darrin
just
about
as
hard
chapter
xiv
the
first
hop
with
the
home
girls
that
report
was
allowed
to
reach
dan
ears
on
a
friday
on
the
evening
of
the
day
following
there
was
to
be
a
midshipman
hop
on
the
floor
of
the
great
gym
moreover
it
was
the
very
hop
that
belle
meade
and
laura
bentley
had
finally
selected
to
attend
meade
was
coming
with
the
girls
as
chaperon
oh
but
i
shall
feel
fine
and
light
hearted
for
going
to
the
dance
muttered
dan
miserably
facing
the
from
the
academy
and
doing
the
light
hearted
and
the
fantastic
toe
with
the
girls
i
sha
feel
a
whole
lot
more
merry
myself
sighed
dave
as
he
gazed
affectionately
wistfully
at
his
chum
danny
this
has
hit
me
about
as
hard
as
it
has
you
and
it
warns
me
too
that
my
turn
will
probably
come
next
i
do
stand
an
awful
lot
higher
in
my
markings
than
you
do
does
it
feel
fine
to
be
a
bilger
gulped
dalzell
staring
at
the
floor
a
bilger
as
has
been
already
explained
is
a
midshipman
who
has
failed
and
has
been
dropped
oh
but
you
not
a
bilger
yet
cried
darrin
leaping
up
and
resting
both
hands
on
his
chum
shoulder
what
the
odds
demanded
dan
grimly
i
shall
be
after
i
been
before
the
board
next
monday
forenoon
at
ten
nonsense
not
if
you
make
a
good
fight
fight
nothing
sighed
dan
wearily
in
a
fight
there
some
one
else
that
you
can
hit
back
at
but
i
wo
have
a
blessed
soul
to
fight
up
against
a
gang
who
are
all
referees
and
all
down
on
me
at
the
outset
nonsense
combatted
dave
you
oh
that
all
right
david
little
giant
returned
dalzell
with
an
attempt
at
cheeriness
you
mean
well
but
a
fellow
is
reported
deficient
unless
he
so
far
behind
that
the
board
has
his
case
settled
in
advance
from
all
i
can
hear
it
is
once
in
a
camel
age
that
a
fellow
so
reported
and
ordered
before
the
board
gets
off
with
anything
less
than
a
hard
wet
bilge
what
i
thinking
of
now
is
what
am
i
going
to
pick
up
as
a
career
when
i
go
home
from
here
as
a
failure
if
it
had
been
for
the
pride
he
felt
in
still
having
the
uniform
on
dalzell
might
not
have
been
able
to
check
the
tears
that
tried
to
flow
come
on
commanded
dave
leaping
up
we
run
up
to
the
deck
above
and
see
if
we
ca
find
freeman
in
what
good
will
that
do
demanded
dan
freeman
is
a
first
classman
but
he
has
any
particular
drag
with
the
board
it
wo
do
any
harm
anyway
for
us
to
have
a
talk
with
an
older
classman
argued
dave
button
your
blouse
straighten
your
hair
and
come
along
so
it
as
bad
as
that
is
it
asked
freeman
sympathetically
after
his
cheery
come
in
had
admitted
the
unhappy
youngsters
yes
replied
dave
incisively
now
the
question
is
what
can
be
done
about
it
i
wish
you
had
asked
me
an
easier
one
sighed
the
first
classman
you
mighty
well
liked
all
through
the
academy
dalzell
and
every
one
of
us
will
hate
to
see
you
go
but
what
can
be
done
to
ward
off
that
fate
insisted
darrin
as
impatiently
as
a
third
classman
might
speak
to
a
venerable
first
classman
well
now
i
want
to
think
over
that
confessed
freeman
frankly
of
course
dalzell
record
this
term
is
in
black
and
white
and
ca
be
gainsaid
it
just
possible
our
young
friend
can
put
up
some
line
of
talk
that
will
extend
his
time
here
and
perhaps
enable
him
to
pull
through
it
a
mighty
important
question
so
i
tell
you
what
do
of
course
the
hop
comes
on
for
night
let
me
have
until
sunday
evening
meanwhile
i
talk
with
some
of
the
other
fellows
of
my
class
you
both
come
in
here
sunday
evening
and
i
have
the
answer
for
you
if
there
any
possible
way
of
finding
one
with
that
the
chums
had
to
be
content
expressing
their
gratitude
to
this
friendly
first
classman
they
withdrew
that
saturday
forenoon
dan
did
considerably
better
with
the
two
recitations
that
he
had
in
hand
i
got
easier
questions
than
usual
i
guess
he
said
to
dave
with
a
mournful
smile
after
saturday
dinner
dave
and
dan
having
secured
permission
to
visit
in
annapolis
steered
their
course
through
the
gate
straight
up
maryland
avenue
through
state
circle
and
around
into
main
street
to
the
maryland
house
at
the
desk
they
sent
up
their
cards
to
meade
then
stepped
into
the
parlor
barely
two
minutes
had
passed
when
belle
and
laura
flew
downstairs
mother
says
she
be
down
as
soon
as
she
fancies
you
care
about
seeing
her
laughed
belle
and
how
are
you
getting
on
in
your
classes
asked
laura
bentley
glancing
straight
at
unhappy
dan
both
midshipmen
had
agreed
not
to
mention
a
word
of
dan
heartache
to
either
of
the
girls
dan
gulped
hard
though
he
managed
to
conceal
the
fact
darrin
however
was
ready
with
the
answer
oh
we
having
pretty
rough
sailing
but
we
both
still
in
our
class
which
statement
was
wholly
truthful
up
at
west
point
laura
continued
dick
told
us
that
the
first
two
years
were
the
hardest
for
a
man
to
keep
his
place
i
fancy
it
just
about
the
same
here
is
it
just
about
dave
nodded
the
first
two
years
are
hardest
because
it
takes
all
that
time
for
a
fellow
to
get
himself
keyed
up
to
the
gait
of
study
that
is
required
in
the
government
academies
but
wo
you
let
us
talk
about
something
that
really
pleasant
girls
dave
asked
with
his
charming
smile
suppose
we
talk
about
yourselves
my
but
you
girls
are
good
to
look
at
after
that
the
conversation
was
shifted
to
lighter
subjects
even
dan
in
the
joy
of
meeting
two
girl
friends
from
home
began
to
be
less
conscious
of
his
load
of
misery
presently
meade
came
down
she
chatted
with
the
two
young
midshipmen
for
a
few
moments
then
dave
proposed
would
you
like
us
to
escort
you
through
the
academy
grounds
so
that
you
can
get
a
good
idea
of
the
place
in
daylight
we
been
waiting
only
for
you
to
invite
us
rejoined
belle
for
the
next
two
hours
the
time
was
passed
pleasantly
but
belle
behind
all
her
light
chatter
was
unusually
keen
and
observing
is
anything
wrong
with
either
of
you
she
asked
dave
suddenly
when
this
pair
were
out
of
easy
hearing
of
the
others
why
do
you
ask
that
inquired
dave
looking
at
her
in
his
direct
fashion
why
i
may
be
unnecessarily
sensitive
but
i
ca
help
feeling
that
some
sort
of
disaster
is
hanging
over
either
you
or
dan
i
hope
not
replied
darrin
evasively
dave
that
is
a
direct
answer
warned
belle
raising
her
eyebrows
do
you
consider
me
entitled
to
one
yes
what
the
question
are
you
in
any
trouble
here
no
i
thankful
to
say
then
is
dan
belle
i
rather
not
answer
that
why
well
because
if
he
is
i
rather
not
discuss
it
has
dan
been
caught
in
any
scrape
no
his
conduct
record
is
fine
then
it
must
be
failure
in
his
studies
dave
did
not
answer
why
do
you
tell
me
insisted
belle
if
anything
were
in
the
wind
belle
we
rather
not
tell
you
and
spoil
your
visit
and
do
ask
dan
anything
about
it
i
think
i
know
enough
went
on
belle
thoughtfully
and
sympathetically
poor
dan
he
one
of
the
finest
of
fellows
there
are
no
better
made
retorted
dave
promptly
if
anything
happens
to
dan
here
dear
i
know
you
will
feel
just
as
unhappy
about
it
as
if
it
happened
to
yourself
mighty
close
to
it
nodded
darrin
but
it
would
be
a
double
heartbreak
for
me
if
i
had
to
leave
why
on
account
of
the
future
i
planned
for
you
belle
oh
you
silly
boy
then
belle
answered
smiling
into
his
eyes
i
believe
i
have
half
committed
myself
to
the
idea
of
marrying
you
when
you
made
your
place
in
life
but
it
was
dave
darrin
to
whom
i
gave
that
half
promise
not
a
uniform
of
any
sort
dave
if
anything
ever
happens
that
you
have
to
quit
here
do
imagine
that
it
going
to
make
a
particle
of
difference
in
our
understanding
you
the
real
kind
of
sweetheart
belle
murmured
dave
gazing
admiringly
at
her
flushed
face
did
you
ever
suspect
that
i
was
asked
miss
meade
demurely
never
declared
midshipman
darrin
devoutly
nevertheless
it
fine
to
be
reassured
once
in
a
while
what
a
great
fellow
dan
is
exclaimed
belle
a
few
minutes
later
see
how
gayly
he
is
chatting
with
laura
i
do
believe
laura
guesses
for
a
moment
that
dan
dalzell
is
just
as
game
a
fellow
as
the
spartan
boy
of
olden
times
chapter
xv
a
disagreeable
first
classman
the
hop
that
night
was
one
of
the
happiest
occasions
dave
had
ever
known
yet
it
was
destined
to
result
in
trouble
for
him
midshipman
treadwell
of
the
first
class
caught
sight
of
belle
as
she
entered
the
gym
at
dave
darrin
side
with
treadwell
it
happened
to
be
one
of
those
violent
though
unusually
silly
affairs
known
as
love
at
first
sight
as
for
belle
she
was
not
likely
to
have
eyes
for
anyone
in
particular
save
dave
treadwell
who
had
come
alone
and
who
was
not
to
be
overburdened
with
dances
went
after
dave
as
soon
as
that
youngster
left
belle
for
the
first
time
mighty
sweet
looking
girl
you
have
with
you
darry
observed
the
first
classman
though
he
took
pains
not
to
betray
too
much
enthusiasm
right
nodded
dave
you
present
me
wo
you
assuredly
as
soon
as
i
come
back
i
have
a
little
commission
to
attend
to
and
you
might
be
extremely
kind
darry
and
write
me
down
for
a
couple
of
numbers
on
miss
miss
meade
is
the
young
lady
name
then
delight
me
by
writing
down
a
couple
of
reservations
for
me
on
miss
meade
card
darrin
face
clouded
slightly
i
like
to
treadwell
but
the
card
is
pretty
crowded
and
some
other
fellows
one
dance
anyway
then
i
will
then
if
there
a
space
to
be
left
and
if
miss
meade
is
agreeable
promised
dave
as
he
hurried
away
two
minutes
later
when
he
returned
looking
very
handsome
indeed
in
his
dress
coat
dave
felt
his
arm
touched
i
waiting
for
you
to
keep
your
engagement
with
me
midshipman
treadwell
murmured
come
along
i
shall
be
delighted
to
present
you
to
miss
meade
since
every
midshipman
is
granted
to
be
a
gentleman
midshipman
etiquette
does
not
require
that
the
lady
be
consulted
about
the
introduction
miss
meade
began
dave
bowing
before
his
sweetheart
i
wish
to
present
treadwell
belle
greeting
was
easy
treadwell
gazing
intensely
into
her
eyes
exchanged
a
few
commonplaces
belle
entirely
at
her
ease
did
not
appear
to
be
affected
by
the
battery
of
treadwell
gaze
then
good
breeding
required
that
the
first
classman
make
another
bow
and
stroll
away
as
he
left
treadwell
murmured
in
dave
ear
do
forget
that
dance
darry
two
if
there
is
any
show
midshipman
darrin
nodded
slightly
as
he
turned
to
belle
that
young
lady
demanded
lightly
is
that
pirate
one
of
your
friends
dave
not
more
so
than
any
other
comrades
in
the
brigade
darrin
answered
why
nothing
only
i
saw
you
two
speaking
together
a
little
while
ago
that
was
when
he
was
asking
me
to
present
him
then
after
you
left
him
continued
belle
in
a
low
voice
treadwell
scowled
after
you
as
though
he
could
have
demolished
you
why
i
no
doubt
treadwell
is
very
jealous
of
me
laughed
damn
happily
why
should
he
be
by
the
way
will
you
let
me
see
your
dance
card
treadwell
asked
me
to
write
his
name
down
for
one
or
two
dances
please
do
begged
belle
suddenly
gripping
her
dance
card
tightly
i
hope
you
do
mind
dave
she
added
in
a
whisper
but
i
taken
just
a
shadow
of
a
dislike
to
treadwell
after
the
way
that
he
scowled
after
you
i
i
really
do
want
to
dance
with
him
dave
could
only
bow
which
he
did
then
other
midshipmen
were
presented
belle
card
was
quickly
filled
without
the
appearance
of
midshipman
treadwell
name
on
it
the
orchestra
struck
up
dave
danced
the
first
two
numbers
with
belle
moving
through
a
dream
of
happiness
as
he
felt
her
waist
against
his
arm
one
of
her
hands
resting
on
his
shoulder
the
second
dance
was
a
repetition
of
dave
pleasure
then
dave
and
dan
exchanged
partners
for
two
more
dances
after
their
first
dance
a
waltz
dave
led
laura
to
a
seat
will
you
get
me
a
glass
of
water
dave
laura
asked
fanning
herself
as
dave
hastened
away
he
felt
once
more
a
light
detaining
touch
darry
did
you
save
those
two
dances
for
me
with
miss
meade
asked
treadwell
oh
i
sorry
dave
replied
but
there
had
been
many
other
applicants
by
the
time
that
miss
meade
card
was
filled
there
were
many
disappointed
ones
and
i
one
of
them
demanded
treadwell
very
sorry
replied
darrin
regretfully
but
you
were
one
of
the
ones
very
good
sir
replied
treadwell
coldly
and
moved
away
now
i
wager
anything
that
treadwell
is
sore
with
me
murmured
dave
to
himself
however
belle
is
the
one
to
be
pleased
it
was
a
particularly
gay
and
pleasant
hop
when
it
was
over
dave
and
dan
escorted
the
girls
and
meade
back
to
the
hotel
the
little
room
in
bancroft
hall
seemed
especially
small
and
dingy
to
the
returning
midshipmen
especially
was
dan
dalzell
in
the
blues
though
he
had
been
outwardly
gay
with
the
girls
he
now
suffered
a
dave
too
shivered
for
his
friend
meade
and
the
girls
returned
by
an
early
morning
train
so
the
two
chums
did
not
see
the
girls
again
during
that
visit
on
sunday
dave
went
at
his
books
with
a
dogged
air
after
morning
chapel
and
dinner
i
suppose
this
is
the
last
day
of
study
for
me
here
grimaced
dan
so
i
mean
to
make
the
most
of
the
pleasure
nonsense
retorted
darrin
heartily
you
finish
out
this
year
and
then
have
two
more
solid
years
of
study
here
ahead
of
you
cut
it
begged
dan
dolefully
do
try
to
jolly
me
along
like
that
you
down
in
the
dumps
just
now
danny
boy
smiled
darrin
wistfully
just
bombard
the
board
with
talk
and
you
pull
through
all
right
dan
sighed
then
went
on
with
his
study
later
in
the
afternoon
dave
feeling
the
need
of
fresh
air
closed
his
books
come
for
a
walk
danny
boy
do
dare
to
replied
dalzell
morosely
so
though
darrin
went
out
he
resolved
not
to
remain
long
away
from
his
moody
chum
outside
on
one
of
the
cement
walks
dave
turned
toward
flirtation
walk
it
seemed
the
best
surrounding
in
which
to
think
of
belle
mr
darrin
called
a
voice
dave
turned
to
behold
treadwell
coming
at
a
fast
stride
with
a
scowl
on
his
face
that
was
a
dirty
trick
you
played
me
last
night
mr
darrin
cried
the
first
classman
angrily
what
gasped
dave
astonished
for
this
was
not
in
line
with
the
usual
conversation
of
midshipmen
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
cried
treadwell
angrily
you
spiked
my
only
chance
to
dance
with
miss
meade
you
wrong
there
retorted
dave
coldly
and
truthfully
i
did
then
how
did
it
happen
i
ca
discuss
that
with
you
darrin
rejoined
i
did
make
any
effort
though
to
spoil
your
chance
of
a
dance
with
the
young
lady
darrin
i
do
choose
to
believe
you
sir
dave
face
went
crimson
then
pale
do
you
realize
what
you
saying
mr
treadwell
of
course
sneeringly
are
you
trying
to
pick
trouble
with
me
demanded
dave
his
eyes
flashing
with
spirit
i
repeat
that
i
do
choose
to
believe
your
explanation
sir
then
you
pass
me
the
lie
as
you
prefer
to
consider
it
jeered
the
first
classman
oh
very
good
then
treadwell
retorted
dave
eyeing
the
first
classman
and
sizing
him
up
treadwell
was
one
of
the
biggest
men
physically
in
the
brigade
he
was
also
one
of
the
noted
fighters
of
his
class
beside
treadwell
midshipman
darrin
did
not
size
up
at
all
advantageously
if
you
do
not
retract
what
you
just
said
pursued
dave
darrin
growing
cooler
now
that
he
realized
the
deliberate
nature
of
the
affront
that
had
been
put
upon
him
i
shall
have
no
choice
but
to
send
my
friends
to
you
delighted
to
see
them
at
any
time
replied
the
first
classman
turning
disdainfully
upon
his
heel
and
strolling
away
now
why
on
earth
does
that
fellow
deliberately
pick
a
fight
with
me
wondered
darrin
as
he
strolled
along
by
himself
treadwell
can
thump
me
he
can
knock
me
clean
down
the
bay
and
into
the
atlantic
ocean
but
what
credit
is
there
in
it
for
a
first
classman
to
thrash
a
youngster
it
was
too
big
a
puzzle
after
thinking
it
over
for
some
time
dave
turned
and
strolled
back
to
bancroft
hall
you
did
stay
out
long
remarked
dan
looking
up
with
a
weary
smile
as
his
chum
their
room
no
admitted
dave
there
was
much
fun
in
being
out
alone
with
a
sigh
dan
turned
back
to
his
book
while
dave
seated
himself
at
his
own
study
table
in
a
brown
daze
things
were
happening
fast
dan
impending
bilge
from
the
naval
academy
and
his
own
coming
fight
with
the
first
classman
who
would
be
sure
to
make
it
a
blood
fight
chapter
xvi
how
dan
faced
the
board
we
trust
dalzell
that
you
can
make
some
statement
or
explanation
that
will
show
that
we
shall
be
justified
in
retaining
you
as
a
midshipman
in
the
naval
academy
it
was
the
superintendent
of
the
united
states
naval
academy
who
was
speaking
dan
hour
of
great
ordeal
had
come
upon
him
that
young
midshipman
found
himself
in
the
board
room
facing
the
entire
academic
board
trying
to
remember
what
freeman
had
told
him
the
night
before
the
time
was
on
that
fateful
monday
midshipman
dalzell
appeared
to
be
collected
but
he
was
also
very
certainly
many
a
young
man
doomed
to
be
sent
forth
from
a
naval
career
back
into
the
busy
unheeding
world
had
faced
this
board
in
times
past
so
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
dan
would
inspire
any
unusual
interest
in
the
members
of
the
board
dan
swallowed
at
something
hard
in
his
throat
then
opened
his
lips
to
speak
i
am
aware
sir
and
gentlemen
that
i
am
at
present
sufficiently
deficient
in
my
studies
to
warrant
my
being
dropped
dan
began
rather
slowly
yet
i
would
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
was
nearly
as
badly
off
in
the
matter
of
markings
at
this
time
last
year
it
is
also
a
matter
of
record
that
i
pulled
myself
together
later
on
and
contrived
to
get
through
the
first
year
with
a
considerable
margin
of
credits
to
spare
if
i
am
permitted
to
finish
the
present
term
here
i
believe
i
can
almost
positively
promise
that
i
will
round
out
this
year
with
as
good
a
showing
as
i
did
last
year
you
have
thought
the
matter
carefully
out
in
making
this
statement
have
you
mr
dalzell
asked
the
superintendent
i
have
sir
have
you
any
explanation
to
offer
for
falling
below
the
standards
so
far
this
year
mr
dalzell
i
believe
sir
that
i
make
a
much
slower
start
with
new
studies
than
most
of
my
classmates
dan
continued
speaking
more
rapidly
now
but
in
a
most
respectful
manner
once
i
begin
to
catch
the
full
drift
of
new
studies
i
believe
that
i
will
overtake
some
of
my
classmates
who
showed
a
keener
comprehension
at
the
first
i
think
sir
and
gentlemen
that
my
record
as
contrasted
with
the
records
of
some
of
my
classmates
who
achieved
about
the
same
standing
i
did
for
last
year
will
bear
my
statement
out
illustration
have
you
any
explanation
to
offer
mr
dalzell
the
superintendent
turned
to
a
printed
pamphlet
in
which
were
set
forth
the
records
of
the
midshipmen
for
the
year
before
dalzell
asked
another
member
of
the
board
do
you
feel
that
you
are
really
suited
for
the
life
of
the
navy
is
it
your
highest
ambition
to
become
an
officer
of
the
navy
it
my
only
ambition
sir
in
the
way
of
a
career
dan
answered
solemnly
as
to
my
being
suited
for
the
navy
sir
i
ca
make
a
good
answer
to
that
but
i
most
earnestly
hope
that
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
for
the
present
to
try
to
keep
myself
in
the
service
and
you
feel
convinced
that
you
need
only
to
be
carried
for
the
balance
of
the
term
to
enable
you
to
make
good
and
to
justify
any
action
that
we
may
take
looking
to
that
end
asked
another
member
of
the
board
that
is
my
firm
conviction
sir
the
superintendent
who
had
been
silently
examining
and
marking
some
statements
in
the
pamphlet
now
passed
it
to
the
nearest
member
of
the
board
who
after
a
glance
or
two
passed
the
pamphlet
on
to
another
member
silence
fell
upon
the
room
while
dan
printed
record
was
being
read
have
you
anything
else
that
you
wish
to
say
mr
dalzell
asked
the
superintendent
at
last
only
this
sir
and
gentlemen
replied
dan
promptly
if
i
am
permitted
to
go
on
with
the
brigade
i
promise
as
far
as
any
human
being
may
promise
that
i
will
not
only
be
found
to
have
passed
at
the
end
of
this
term
but
that
i
will
also
have
a
higher
marking
after
the
annual
examinations
than
after
the
these
last
few
words
dan
spoke
with
his
whole
soul
thrown
into
the
words
how
he
longed
to
remain
in
the
navy
now
that
he
stood
at
the
threshold
of
the
life
uncertain
whether
he
was
about
to
be
kicked
across
it
into
the
outer
world
after
glancing
around
the
table
the
superintendent
turned
once
more
to
the
young
man
that
will
be
all
at
present
mr
dalzell
saluting
briskly
crisply
dan
wheeled
about
marching
from
the
room
he
was
in
time
to
make
a
section
recitation
before
dinner
how
did
you
come
out
danny
boy
anxiously
inquired
dave
darrin
as
the
two
in
their
room
hastily
prepared
to
answer
the
coming
call
for
dinner
formation
i
wish
i
knew
replied
dalzell
wistfully
i
said
all
that
i
could
say
without
being
everlastingly
fresh
after
the
brigade
had
been
formed
for
dinner
and
the
brigade
adjutant
had
reported
the
fact
the
command
was
given
publish
the
orders
this
the
brigade
adjutant
did
rapidly
and
in
perfunctory
tones
dalzell
jumped
however
when
he
heard
his
own
name
pronounced
he
strained
his
ears
as
the
brigade
adjutant
read
in
the
matter
of
daniel
dalzell
summoned
before
the
academic
board
to
determine
his
fitness
and
aptitude
for
continuing
in
the
brigade
the
board
has
granted
midshipman
dalzell
urgent
request
that
he
be
continued
as
a
midshipman
for
the
present
there
was
a
great
lump
instantly
in
dan
throat
it
was
a
reprieve
a
chance
for
official
life
but
that
was
all
i
make
good
i
make
good
he
told
himself
with
a
violent
gulp
the
orders
were
ringing
out
sharply
now
the
midshipmen
were
being
marched
in
to
dinner
hardly
a
word
did
dalzell
speak
as
he
ate
as
for
dave
darrin
he
was
too
happy
over
his
chum
respite
to
want
to
talk
yet
when
they
strolled
together
in
the
open
air
during
the
brief
recreation
period
following
the
meal
dalzell
suddenly
asked
dave
when
do
you
fight
with
treadwell
i
hope
replied
darrin
oh
then
i
must
get
busy
why
why
i
to
represent
you
darry
who
are
treadwell
danny
boy
do
make
a
fuss
about
it
replied
dave
quietly
but
just
for
this
once
you
are
not
to
be
my
second
why
danny
boy
you
have
just
gotten
by
the
board
by
a
hair
breadth
what
kind
of
an
act
of
gratitude
would
it
be
for
you
to
make
your
first
act
a
breach
of
discipline
for
a
fight
though
often
necessary
here
is
in
defiance
of
the
regulations
but
dave
i
never
been
out
of
your
fights
you
will
be
this
time
danny
do
worry
about
it
either
farley
and
page
are
going
to
stand
by
me
in
fact
i
think
that
even
now
they
are
talking
with
treadwell
friends
you
wrong
murmured
dalzell
looking
very
solemn
here
come
farley
and
page
right
now
in
another
moment
the
seconds
had
reached
darrin
and
his
chum
asked
dave
quietly
yes
nodded
page
time
just
after
recall
good
murmured
darrin
you
two
come
for
me
and
i
be
ready
and
i
thank
both
of
you
fellows
for
taking
up
the
matter
for
me
we
be
mighty
glad
to
be
there
darry
grinned
farley
for
we
look
to
see
you
finish
off
that
first
classman
maybe
smiled
dave
quietly
i
do
all
i
can
anyway
and
to
think
almost
moaned
dan
dalzell
that
you
to
be
in
a
scrap
david
little
giant
and
i
not
to
be
there
to
see
there
be
other
fights
i
afraid
sighed
darry
i
seem
destined
to
displease
quite
a
few
of
the
fellows
here
at
annapolis
dan
tried
to
study
that
night
after
darrin
had
left
the
room
in
the
company
of
his
seconds
certainly
dan
in
the
light
of
his
promise
made
to
the
board
that
morning
had
need
to
study
yet
he
found
it
woefully
hard
to
settle
his
mind
on
mathematics
while
dave
was
fighting
the
fight
of
his
naval
academy
career
oh
well
muttered
dan
picking
up
a
pencil
for
the
third
time
dave
and
i
each
have
our
own
styles
of
fights
just
now
here
goes
for
a
knockout
blow
at
math
chapter
xvii
losing
the
count
conners
and
brayton
were
treadwell
seconds
since
it
is
not
considered
fair
to
have
the
referee
or
from
either
class
represented
in
a
fight
edgerton
and
wheeler
of
the
second
class
were
referee
and
respectively
all
of
the
young
men
were
early
at
the
usual
fighting
ground
the
fall
air
was
cool
and
crisp
but
it
was
not
yet
considered
cold
enough
to
justify
the
extra
risk
of
holding
a
fight
dave
was
quickly
stripped
and
made
ready
by
his
seconds
his
chest
bespoke
fine
powers
in
the
way
of
wind
and
endurance
his
smooth
hard
trim
muscles
stood
out
distinctly
treadwell
took
more
time
in
getting
himself
ready
for
the
ring
when
at
last
however
the
first
classman
stood
bared
to
the
waist
he
looked
like
a
giant
beside
dave
darrin
it
looks
like
a
shame
to
take
the
money
tread
murmured
referee
edgerton
i
do
want
to
pound
the
youngster
hard
explained
midshipman
treadwell
in
an
undertone
yet
i
got
to
teach
him
both
to
respect
my
class
and
myself
on
this
point
as
an
official
of
the
fight
referee
edgerton
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
express
an
opinion
farley
at
his
first
glimpse
of
the
waiting
first
classman
felt
a
chill
of
coming
disaster
page
he
growled
that
huge
makes
our
darry
look
like
a
creeping
infant
darry
will
take
care
of
himself
retorted
midshipman
page
in
an
undertone
do
you
believe
it
i
surely
do
but
treadwell
looks
a
whole
lot
more
vast
now
that
he
stripped
darry
is
much
smaller
i
know
but
darrin
is
one
of
those
rare
fellows
who
do
know
what
it
means
to
be
whipped
he
ca
be
put
out
of
business
by
anything
smaller
than
a
gun
i
hope
you
right
sighed
farley
dave
in
the
meantime
to
keep
himself
from
being
chilled
by
the
frosty
air
was
running
lightly
about
swinging
his
arms
are
you
both
ready
gentlemen
inquired
midshipman
edgerton
while
wheeler
drew
out
his
stop
watch
both
stepped
to
toe
the
scratch
yes
nodded
dave
ready
rumbled
treadwell
the
referee
briefly
made
the
usual
announcement
about
it
being
a
fight
to
the
finish
with
rounds
and
two
minutes
between
rounds
time
as
treadwell
leaped
forward
both
fists
in
battery
dave
took
a
swift
nimble
sidestep
he
felt
that
he
had
to
study
this
big
fellow
carefully
before
doing
more
than
keep
on
the
defensive
now
footwork
was
one
of
the
fighting
tricks
for
which
darry
was
famous
yet
he
had
too
much
courage
to
rely
wholly
upon
it
five
times
treadwell
swung
at
his
smaller
opponent
but
each
time
dave
was
somewhere
else
despite
his
greater
size
treadwell
was
himself
nimble
and
an
adept
at
footwork
finding
it
hard
however
to
get
about
as
quickly
as
his
smaller
opponent
the
first
classman
soon
went
in
for
close
fighting
following
dave
him
and
forcing
him
to
stand
and
take
it
two
or
three
body
blows
dave
succeeded
in
parrying
so
that
they
glanced
doing
him
little
harm
then
there
came
an
almost
crunching
sound
treadwell
right
fist
had
landed
almost
dazing
the
youngster
with
its
weight
against
his
nose
there
was
a
swift
free
rush
of
the
red
darrin
had
yielded
up
first
blood
in
the
fight
i
got
to
dodge
more
and
not
let
myself
be
cornered
darrin
told
himself
keeping
his
fists
busy
in
warding
off
blows
then
of
a
sudden
dave
turned
on
the
aggressive
he
struck
fast
and
furiously
but
treadwell
with
a
grin
beat
down
his
attack
then
soon
landed
a
swinging
hook
on
dave
neck
that
sent
him
spinning
briefly
he
expects
to
finish
this
fight
for
his
own
amusement
flashed
angrily
through
darrin
mind
i
get
in
something
that
hurts
before
i
toss
the
sponge
time
two
minutes
were
up
to
dave
it
seemed
more
like
half
an
hour
steady
now
murmured
page
in
his
principal
ear
as
the
two
seconds
leaped
at
the
task
of
rubbing
down
their
men
unless
you
let
yourself
get
rattled
darry
that
big
fellow
is
going
to
get
you
whenever
you
on
the
defensive
and
being
crowded
hard
change
like
lightning
and
drive
in
for
the
top
classer
solar
plexus
i
tried
that
three
times
in
this
last
round
murmured
dave
but
the
fellow
is
too
big
and
powerful
for
me
he
simply
pounds
me
down
when
i
go
for
him
work
for
more
strategy
whispered
page
as
he
held
a
sponge
to
battered
nose
while
farley
rubbed
the
muscles
of
his
right
arm
i
have
given
up
the
fight
muttered
dave
but
of
course
known
from
the
start
that
treadwell
is
a
pretty
big
fighter
for
one
of
my
weight
oh
you
get
him
yet
spoke
page
confidently
the
fighters
were
being
called
for
the
second
round
in
this
dave
received
considerable
punishment
though
he
landed
three
or
four
times
on
treadwell
body
then
twice
in
succession
the
champion
of
the
third
class
was
knocked
down
neither
however
was
a
knockout
blow
dave
took
plenty
of
time
within
his
rights
about
leaping
to
his
feet
and
in
each
instance
got
away
from
treadwell
leaping
assault
just
after
the
second
time
was
called
for
the
end
of
the
round
you
get
him
yet
darry
was
page
prediction
but
he
did
not
speak
as
hopefully
as
before
farley
too
was
full
of
loyalty
for
his
friend
and
but
he
did
not
allow
this
to
blind
his
judgment
farley
opinion
was
that
dave
was
done
for
unless
he
could
land
some
lucky
fluke
in
a
knockout
blow
go
right
in
and
land
that
youngster
treadwell
own
seconds
were
advising
him
do
let
him
have
the
satisfaction
of
standing
up
to
you
for
three
whole
rounds
or
more
do
you
think
that
little
teaser
is
as
easy
as
he
looks
growled
treadwell
oh
darrin
is
all
right
at
his
own
weight
admitted
midshipman
conners
but
he
has
no
business
with
you
tread
you
quick
enough
too
when
you
exert
yourself
so
jump
right
in
and
finish
it
before
this
round
is
over
i
try
it
then
nodded
treadwell
though
he
had
not
the
slightest
notion
that
he
was
to
be
defeated
this
big
top
classman
was
learning
a
new
respect
for
darrin
prowess
he
could
thrash
dave
of
course
but
treadwell
did
not
expect
to
do
it
easily
for
the
first
twenty
seconds
of
the
third
round
the
two
men
sparred
cautiously
dave
had
no
relish
for
standing
the
full
force
of
those
blows
while
treadwell
knew
that
he
must
look
out
for
the
unexpected
from
his
still
nimble
opponent
lie
down
when
you
had
enough
jeered
treadwell
as
he
landed
a
jolt
on
one
of
the
youngster
shoulders
and
sent
him
reeling
slightly
dave
however
used
his
feet
well
enough
to
get
away
from
the
are
you
getting
tired
darrin
shot
back
at
his
opponent
silence
both
of
you
commanded
referee
edgerton
do
all
your
talking
with
your
fists
just
then
treadwell
saw
an
opening
and
followed
the
referee
advice
by
aiming
a
blow
at
dave
left
jaw
it
landed
just
back
of
the
ear
instead
yet
with
such
force
that
dave
sank
dizzily
to
the
ground
while
treadwell
drew
back
from
the
intended
farley
and
page
looked
on
anxiously
from
their
corner
midshipman
wheeler
scanning
his
watch
was
counting
off
the
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
at
the
sound
of
eight
dave
darrin
had
made
a
strenuous
effort
to
rise
yet
he
had
swayed
fallen
back
slightly
then
forced
himself
with
a
rush
to
his
feet
but
midshipman
treadwell
drew
back
both
fists
hanging
at
his
sides
for
the
ten
had
been
spoken
and
dave
darrin
had
lost
the
count
while
dave
stood
there
looking
at
his
opponent
referee
edgerton
voice
broke
in
crisply
darrin
required
more
than
the
full
count
to
come
back
the
fight
is
therefore
awarded
to
mr
treadwell
chapter
xviii
fighting
the
famous
double
battle
it
was
fair
hissed
midshipman
page
hotly
it
was
by
a
mighty
small
margin
anyway
quivered
farley
i
do
feel
whipped
yet
remarked
dave
quietly
oh
well
darry
urged
farley
do
feel
humiliated
over
being
thrashed
by
such
a
human
mountain
of
a
top
classer
dave
whose
chest
had
been
heaving
and
whose
lungs
had
been
taking
in
great
gulps
of
air
suddenly
pushed
his
second
gently
away
treadwell
sir
will
you
come
over
here
a
moment
he
called
and
also
the
officials
of
the
fight
treadwell
with
a
leer
on
his
face
stepped
away
from
his
seconds
coming
jauntily
over
midshipman
edgerton
and
wheeler
followed
in
some
wonder
treadwell
began
dave
looking
full
into
the
eyes
of
his
late
antagonist
i
have
no
fault
sir
to
find
with
your
style
of
fighting
you
behaved
fairly
at
every
point
thank
you
sir
interjected
the
big
midshipman
grimly
the
verdict
was
also
fair
enough
dave
continued
for
i
am
aware
that
i
took
a
more
than
the
count
still
i
do
not
feel
treadwell
that
the
result
was
decisive
therefore
i
have
to
ask
of
you
the
favor
of
another
early
meeting
for
a
more
definite
treadwell
gasped
so
did
his
recent
seconds
and
the
late
officials
of
the
fight
even
farley
jaw
dropped
just
a
trifle
but
page
face
flushed
with
pleasure
another
fight
sir
demanded
midshipman
treadwell
yes
sir
replied
darrin
quietly
oh
very
well
agreed
treadwell
nonchalantly
at
any
time
that
you
wish
darrin
any
time
how
would
fifteen
minutes
from
now
do
demanded
dave
smiling
coolly
treadwell
fairly
gasped
though
only
from
sheer
astonishment
why
if
your
seconds
and
the
officials
think
that
fair
to
you
darrin
replied
treadwell
in
another
moment
i
am
sure
that
i
have
no
objection
to
remaining
around
here
a
little
longer
do
you
insist
on
calling
for
the
second
fight
within
fifteen
minutes
mr
darrin
asked
second
classman
edgerton
for
my
own
part
i
do
replied
dave
quietly
i
leave
the
decision
to
treadwell
courtesy
well
of
all
the
freaks
muttered
wheeler
as
the
two
fight
officials
walked
aside
to
discuss
the
matter
darry
demanded
the
agitated
farley
are
you
plumb
clean
crazy
do
you
know
what
we
fighting
about
farley
old
man
asked
dave
very
quietly
no
of
course
not
it
a
personal
matter
it
a
matter
in
which
i
ca
accept
an
imitation
whipping
but
surely
you
do
expect
to
whip
treadwell
in
your
present
condition
i
very
likely
shall
get
a
thorough
trouncing
smiled
darrin
it
madness
broke
in
page
worriedly
i
told
you
it
was
a
personal
matter
laughed
dave
softly
i
mind
getting
whacked
if
it
is
done
up
in
good
shape
it
only
this
to
which
i
object
well
great
scott
gasped
page
hush
warned
farley
here
comes
edgerton
midshipman
edgerton
looking
very
much
puzzled
stepped
over
to
dave
darrin
corner
darrin
began
the
referee
in
a
friendly
tone
tread
does
like
the
idea
of
fighting
you
again
did
he
say
he
would
demanded
darrin
yes
but
of
course
but
i
hold
him
to
his
word
mr
edgerton
but
of
all
the
crazy
i
have
my
own
reasons
sir
darrin
interposed
quietly
i
think
it
very
likely
too
that
treadwell
will
comprehend
my
reasons
but
he
does
like
the
idea
of
fighting
an
already
man
will
it
get
on
his
nerves
and
unsteady
him
asked
dave
ironically
are
you
bound
to
fight
mr
darrin
i
am
sir
then
i
suppose
it
goes
it
has
to
assented
midshipman
edgerton
moodily
but
of
all
the
irrational
just
what
i
said
sir
nodded
page
i
shall
be
ready
sir
when
the
fifteen
minutes
are
up
continued
dave
but
i
am
certain
that
i
shall
need
all
the
time
until
then
for
getting
myself
into
condition
darry
is
a
fool
and
a
wonder
ejaculated
edgerton
under
his
breath
as
he
walked
away
i
sorry
darry
murmured
farley
mournfully
but
well
beat
your
way
to
it
i
intend
to
retorted
dave
doggedly
rubbed
down
by
his
seconds
dave
drew
on
his
blouse
without
a
shirt
quitting
the
others
dave
walked
briskly
back
and
forth
at
last
he
broke
into
a
at
last
he
halted
inflating
and
emptying
his
lungs
with
vigorous
breathing
i
feel
just
about
as
good
as
ever
he
declared
nodding
cheerily
to
his
seconds
get
off
that
blouse
then
ordered
midshipman
farley
after
a
glance
at
his
watch
we
two
minutes
left
out
of
the
fifteen
i
go
forward
at
the
scratch
then
nodded
dave
treadwell
in
the
meantime
had
pulled
on
his
outer
clothing
and
had
stood
moodily
by
watching
dave
more
workmanlike
preparations
with
a
disdainful
smile
i
get
the
fellow
going
quickly
this
time
treadwell
told
conners
as
soon
as
i
get
him
going
i
dive
in
with
a
punch
that
will
wind
up
the
matter
in
short
order
i
planned
to
do
considerable
reviewing
of
navigation
i
hope
you
have
your
wish
murmured
conners
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
said
do
you
think
i
going
to
have
any
trouble
whatever
about
finishing
up
that
touge
youngster
demanded
tread
well
sarcastically
no
i
do
imagine
you
will
but
at
the
same
time
tread
i
tell
you
i
do
care
about
having
enemies
among
fellows
who
come
back
as
swiftly
strongly
and
as
much
like
a
bulldog
as
darry
does
seeing
dave
pull
off
his
blouse
treadwell
slowly
removed
his
own
clothing
above
the
waist
rub
me
down
along
the
arms
a
bit
said
midshipman
treadwell
after
he
had
exercised
his
arms
a
moment
i
reckon
we
better
nodded
conners
you
must
have
got
stiff
from
standing
still
after
the
late
no
kinks
but
what
will
iron
out
at
once
chuckled
treadwell
show
you
as
soon
as
i
get
in
action
his
two
seconds
rubbed
him
down
loyally
are
you
ready
gentlemen
called
midshipman
edgerton
both
men
stepped
quickly
forward
but
all
of
the
onlookers
thought
they
saw
rather
more
spring
in
dave
darrin
than
in
his
more
bulky
opponent
the
preliminaries
were
announced
in
a
few
words
of
course
there
was
no
handshaking
time
sounded
the
call
dave
darrin
quickly
proved
to
be
so
full
of
vigor
that
treadwell
lay
back
on
the
defensive
after
the
first
two
or
three
passes
dave
followed
him
right
up
with
vim
yet
for
the
first
forty
seconds
of
the
round
no
real
damage
was
done
on
either
side
then
bump
that
cry
came
simultaneously
from
treadwell
and
from
all
the
spectators
dave
right
fist
had
landed
crushingly
on
the
top
classman
left
eye
almost
instantly
closing
that
organ
darrin
leaped
nimbly
back
both
from
a
chivalrous
impulse
to
give
treadwell
a
chance
to
recover
his
steadiness
and
to
save
himself
from
any
sudden
rush
and
clinch
by
his
big
opponent
but
treadwell
standing
with
his
guard
up
showed
no
inclination
to
follow
the
one
who
had
just
given
him
such
punishment
mix
it
up
gentlemen
mix
it
called
midshipman
edgerton
impatiently
at
that
command
from
the
referee
dave
darrin
sprang
forward
treadwell
seemed
wholly
on
the
defensive
now
though
he
struck
as
heavily
as
ever
toward
the
end
of
the
round
treadwell
having
gotten
over
the
worst
of
the
stinging
from
his
eye
once
more
tried
to
rush
matters
whenever
the
big
fellow
undamaged
eye
caught
sight
of
the
cool
hostile
smile
on
darrin
face
treadwell
muttered
savage
words
some
hard
body
blows
were
parried
and
others
exchanged
both
men
were
panting
somewhat
when
the
call
of
time
closed
the
first
round
darry
you
nervy
little
rascal
waltz
in
and
put
that
other
eye
up
in
black
clothes
begged
page
ecstatically
as
he
and
farley
worked
over
their
principal
dave
was
ready
quite
twenty
seconds
before
the
call
of
time
for
the
second
round
treadwell
however
took
his
full
time
in
responding
at
the
last
moment
he
took
another
dab
with
the
wet
sponge
against
his
swollen
left
eye
time
with
a
suppressed
yell
treadwell
rushed
at
his
opponent
dave
had
to
sidestep
to
his
own
right
out
of
range
of
treadwell
to
save
himself
then
at
it
they
went
all
around
the
ring
darrin
had
determined
to
keep
himself
out
of
the
way
of
those
fists
until
he
saw
his
own
clear
opening
four
or
five
times
treadwell
landed
heavily
on
darrin
ribs
the
younger
smaller
midshipman
was
getting
seriously
winded
but
all
the
time
he
fought
to
save
himself
and
to
get
that
one
opening
it
came
pound
darrin
left
fist
dropped
in
on
treadwell
right
eye
this
time
there
was
no
exclamation
from
the
bruised
one
alert
dave
was
careful
to
give
him
no
chance
within
a
second
after
that
landed
darrin
struck
with
his
right
landing
on
the
jaw
bone
under
treadwell
ear
down
in
a
heap
sank
the
top
classman
he
was
unconscious
before
his
body
struck
the
ground
wheeler
counted
off
the
ten
still
treadwell
lay
motionless
do
your
best
for
him
gentlemen
begged
referee
edgerton
turning
to
the
first
classman
seconds
darrin
wins
the
second
fight
dave
a
satisfied
look
on
his
face
stepped
back
to
his
seconds
this
time
he
did
not
require
as
much
attention
within
five
minutes
he
was
dressed
by
this
time
treadwell
under
the
ministrations
of
his
seconds
and
of
the
late
officials
was
just
coming
back
to
consciousness
something
happened
eh
asked
the
top
classman
drowsily
rather
murmured
edgerton
dryly
did
i
did
i
lose
the
fight
you
did
edgerton
assented
but
do
let
that
disturb
you
you
went
down
before
the
best
man
in
the
naval
academy
treadwell
sighed
gloomily
it
was
a
hard
blow
to
his
pride
much
harder
than
any
that
dave
had
landed
on
his
head
treadwell
inquired
dave
stepping
over
we
are
comrades
even
if
we
had
a
slight
disagreement
do
you
care
to
shake
hands
help
me
to
my
feet
urged
the
first
classman
who
was
sitting
up
his
seconds
complied
then
midshipman
treadwell
held
out
his
hand
here
my
hand
he
said
rather
thickly
and
i
apologize
too
mr
darrin
then
say
no
more
about
it
please
begged
dave
as
their
hands
met
in
a
strong
clasp
none
of
the
others
present
had
the
least
idea
of
the
provocation
of
this
strange
spirited
double
fight
all
however
were
glad
to
see
the
difficulty
mended
then
dave
and
his
seconds
leaving
the
field
first
made
their
way
back
to
bancroft
hall
farley
and
page
went
straight
to
their
own
room
how
did
it
come
out
demanded
dan
dalzell
eagerly
as
soon
as
his
chum
entered
their
quarters
dropping
into
a
chair
dave
told
the
story
of
the
double
fight
briefly
he
told
it
modestly
too
but
dan
could
imagine
what
his
chum
omitted
david
little
giant
exclaimed
dalzell
leaping
about
him
that
fight
will
become
historic
here
oh
how
i
regret
having
missed
it
do
you
ever
dare
to
leave
me
out
again
it
was
such
a
much
smiled
dave
rather
wearily
as
he
went
over
to
his
study
desk
perhaps
it
indiscreet
even
of
a
chum
rambled
on
dalzell
but
what
what
was
the
fight
all
about
laughed
dave
softly
yes
i
suppose
you
have
a
right
to
know
that
danny
boy
but
you
must
never
repeat
it
to
any
one
treadwell
wanted
to
dance
with
belle
at
the
hop
but
she
had
already
noticed
him
and
declared
she
did
want
to
dance
with
him
of
course
that
settled
it
but
treadwell
accused
me
of
not
having
asked
belle
the
nerve
ejaculated
dan
in
disgust
and
then
he
accused
me
of
lying
when
i
declared
i
had
done
my
best
for
him
continued
dave
i
feel
that
i
like
to
fight
the
fellow
myself
declared
dan
dalzell
hotly
oh
no
you
do
for
treadwell
apologized
and
we
have
shaken
hands
we
all
comrades
you
know
danny
boy
unknown
to
any
of
the
parties
to
the
fight
there
had
been
spectators
of
the
spirited
double
battle
two
men
a
sailor
and
a
marine
noting
groups
of
midshipmen
going
toward
the
historic
battle
ground
of
midshipmen
had
hidden
themselves
in
order
to
see
the
fun
these
two
enlisted
men
of
the
navy
had
been
spectators
and
auditors
of
all
that
had
taken
place
not
until
the
last
midshipman
had
left
the
ground
did
the
sailor
and
marine
emerge
from
their
hiding
place
well
of
all
the
game
fights
muttered
the
marine
me
i
hoping
that
some
day
i
fight
under
that
gallant
middy
cried
the
sailor
who
is
this
mr
darrin
asked
the
marine
as
the
pair
strolled
away
he
a
youngster
third
classman
but
he
one
of
the
chaps
who
on
the
cruise
last
summer
went
over
into
a
gale
after
another
middy
darrin
and
his
chum
did
it
there
must
be
fine
stuff
in
darrin
murmured
the
marine
could
you
see
that
much
just
now
demanded
the
sailor
who
took
the
remark
as
almost
a
personal
affront
my
hat
off
to
darrin
one
of
our
future
admirals
if
i
round
out
my
days
in
the
service
it
will
be
the
height
of
my
ambition
to
have
him
for
my
admiral
and
a
mighty
officer
he
be
at
that
in
their
enthusiasm
over
the
spectacle
they
had
seen
the
sailor
and
the
marine
talked
rather
too
much
they
were
still
talking
over
the
battle
as
they
strolled
slowly
past
one
of
the
great
darkened
buildings
in
the
shadow
of
this
building
not
far
away
stood
an
officer
whom
neither
of
the
enlisted
men
of
the
navy
saw
else
they
would
have
saluted
him
that
officer
lieutenant
willow
navy
listened
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
willow
was
one
of
those
officers
who
are
known
as
he
gathered
that
there
had
been
a
fight
so
he
deemed
it
his
duty
to
report
the
fact
at
once
to
the
discipline
officer
in
charge
over
at
bancroft
hall
regretting
the
necessity
yet
full
of
the
idea
of
doing
his
duty
lieutenant
willow
wended
his
way
promptly
towards
the
office
of
the
officer
in
charge
chapter
xix
the
officer
in
charge
is
shocked
through
the
main
entrance
of
bancroft
hall
into
the
stately
corridor
lieutenant
willow
picked
his
way
he
looked
solemn
unusually
so
even
for
lieutenant
willow
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
hates
to
do
his
duty
but
who
is
convinced
that
the
heavens
would
fall
if
he
did
to
his
left
he
turned
acknowledging
smartly
the
crisp
salute
given
him
by
the
midshipman
assistant
officer
of
the
day
into
the
outer
office
of
the
officer
in
charge
stepped
willow
and
thence
on
into
the
smaller
room
where
stearns
sat
reading
oh
good
evening
willow
hailed
lieut
stearns
heartily
good
evening
stearns
was
the
almost
moody
reply
sit
down
and
let
have
a
chat
i
glad
to
see
you
urged
stearns
stearns
he
of
the
round
jovial
face
gazed
at
his
junior
with
twinkling
eyes
willow
he
muttered
i
half
inclined
to
believe
that
you
come
to
me
to
make
an
official
report
i
guess
i
have
nodded
lieutenant
willow
and
against
some
unfortunate
midshipman
at
that
against
two
at
least
sighed
willow
and
there
were
others
involved
in
the
affair
it
must
be
something
fearful
said
stearns
who
knew
the
junior
officer
inclination
to
be
but
see
here
if
you
make
an
official
report
you
force
me
to
take
action
even
though
something
that
i
secretly
slap
a
midshipman
on
the
shoulder
for
doing
no
do
begin
to
talk
yet
willow
try
a
cigar
and
then
tell
me
personally
what
worrying
you
then
perhaps
it
wo
be
altogether
needful
to
make
an
official
report
i
never
was
able
to
take
you
er
somewhat
jovial
views
of
an
duty
stearns
sighed
lieutenant
willow
nevertheless
he
selected
a
cigar
bit
off
the
end
lighted
it
and
took
a
few
whiffs
stearns
all
the
while
regarding
his
comrade
in
arms
with
twinkling
eyes
now
fire
ahead
willow
urged
the
officer
in
charge
but
please
do
make
your
communication
an
official
one
not
at
first
fire
ahead
now
willow
well
er
just
between
ourselves
continued
lieutenant
willow
slowly
there
has
been
a
fight
between
two
midshipmen
no
stearns
struck
his
fist
rather
heavily
against
the
desk
a
fight
a
real
fight
with
fists
continued
the
officer
in
charge
in
a
tone
of
mock
incredulity
no
no
no
willow
you
do
mean
it
you
ca
mean
it
yes
i
do
rejoined
the
junior
officer
rather
stiffly
oh
dear
what
is
the
service
coming
to
gasped
stearns
ironically
why
willow
we
never
heard
of
such
things
when
we
were
midshipmen
here
now
did
we
i
afraid
we
did
sometimes
admitted
the
junior
officer
but
duty
is
duty
you
know
my
dear
stearns
and
this
was
an
unusual
fight
too
the
man
who
was
whipped
insisted
on
another
fight
right
then
and
there
and
he
won
the
second
fight
bully
chuckled
the
officer
in
charge
whew
but
i
wish
i
had
been
there
stearns
you
surely
do
mean
that
gasped
willow
you
quite
right
willow
no
i
certainly
do
want
to
be
a
spoilsport
and
i
glad
i
was
there
in
my
official
capacity
but
i
like
to
have
been
divested
of
my
rank
for
just
an
hour
so
that
i
could
have
taken
in
such
a
scene
as
that
i
i
just
a
bit
astonished
at
your
saying
it
stearns
rejoined
lieutenant
willow
but
then
you
always
joking
perhaps
i
am
joking
assented
the
officer
in
charge
dryly
but
i
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
our
navy
has
been
built
up
at
huge
expense
as
a
great
fighting
machine
now
willow
it
takes
fighting
men
to
run
a
fighting
machine
of
course
i
terribly
shocked
to
know
that
two
midshipmen
really
had
the
grit
to
fight
but
who
were
they
mind
you
i
not
asking
you
in
an
official
way
this
question
is
purely
personal
just
between
ourselves
who
were
the
men
and
especially
who
was
the
fellow
who
lost
the
decision
and
then
had
the
utter
effrontery
to
demand
a
second
chance
at
once
only
to
win
the
second
fight
darrin
was
the
man
who
lost
the
first
fight
and
won
the
second
replied
lieutenant
willow
darrin
one
of
our
youngsters
yes
i
think
i
know
him
and
what
man
of
his
class
did
he
whip
the
second
time
he
tried
it
was
a
man
of
his
own
class
it
was
treadwell
of
the
first
class
rejoined
lieutenant
willow
what
almost
exploded
the
officer
in
charge
did
you
say
that
darrin
fought
with
treadwell
that
husky
top
classman
and
losing
the
decision
on
the
count
insisted
on
fighting
again
the
same
evening
oh
say
what
a
fellow
misses
by
being
cooped
up
in
an
office
like
this
but
but
the
breach
of
regulations
stammered
the
lieutenant
my
dear
fellow
neither
you
nor
i
know
anything
about
this
fight
officially
the
navy
after
all
is
a
fighting
machine
do
you
feel
that
the
navy
can
afford
to
lose
a
fighting
man
like
that
youngster
so
lieutenant
willow
left
stearns
presence
not
quite
convinced
he
was
performing
his
whole
duty
but
glad
to
bow
to
the
decision
of
a
ranking
officer
two
days
later
dave
and
dan
were
surprised
at
being
halted
by
stearns
good
afternoon
darrin
came
the
pleasant
greeting
good
afternoon
dalzell
stearns
and
i
would
be
greatly
pleased
if
you
could
take
dinner
with
us
could
you
come
next
sunday
the
two
midshipmen
were
astonished
and
delighted
at
this
invitation
while
it
was
not
uncommon
for
officers
to
invite
midshipmen
to
their
homes
where
there
were
so
many
midshipmen
it
was
as
a
rule
only
the
young
men
who
made
themselves
prominent
socially
who
captured
these
coveted
invitations
darrin
and
dalzell
concealed
their
surprise
but
expressed
their
pleasure
in
accepting
the
gracious
invitation
on
entering
stearns
drawing
room
the
next
sunday
darrin
and
dalzell
were
introduced
to
two
pretty
girls
miss
flora
gentle
was
a
cousin
of
their
hostess
she
had
visited
annapolis
before
and
being
pretty
and
vivacious
at
the
same
time
kind
and
considerate
she
had
many
friends
among
the
midshipmen
marian
stevens
who
had
accompanied
her
on
this
visit
was
a
direct
contrast
flora
was
blonde
marian
was
the
dark
flashing
type
she
was
spoiled
and
imperious
yet
she
had
a
dashing
open
way
about
her
that
made
her
a
favorite
among
young
people
the
two
girls
had
heard
of
the
double
fight
marian
therefore
was
pleased
when
she
found
that
dave
was
to
be
her
dinner
partner
he
handsome
thought
the
girl
and
he
brave
and
dashing
make
his
mark
in
the
navy
he
does
know
it
yet
but
he
become
mine
and
mine
alone
miss
stevens
was
a
calculating
young
person
and
had
already
decided
that
navy
life
was
the
life
for
her
and
that
she
would
marry
into
it
at
seventeen
she
looked
upon
the
officers
as
old
men
even
the
youngest
of
them
so
was
giving
her
time
and
her
smiles
to
the
midshipmen
that
the
navy
pay
is
small
did
not
trouble
maid
marian
as
she
liked
to
be
called
as
on
her
birthday
she
would
come
into
a
considerable
fortune
of
her
own
she
exerted
herself
all
through
the
stearns
dinner
to
captivate
dave
darrin
he
without
diminution
of
love
and
loyalty
to
belle
mead
was
glad
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
this
dashing
and
sprightly
girl
coffee
was
served
in
the
drawing
room
several
officers
dropped
in
marian
who
wished
no
one
to
come
between
her
and
dave
for
a
while
turned
to
her
host
stearns
do
the
regulations
make
it
improper
for
flora
and
me
to
ask
darrin
and
dalzell
to
take
us
for
a
stroll
about
the
yard
she
asked
with
a
pretty
air
of
deference
the
yard
includes
all
the
grounds
belonging
to
the
naval
academy
they
do
not
miss
marian
was
the
smiling
response
with
our
hostess
approval
we
shall
be
charmed
to
grant
any
request
the
young
ladies
make
ventured
dave
as
marian
smiled
into
his
eyes
but
marian
the
wily
and
experienced
found
herself
baffled
during
this
walk
using
all
her
cajoleries
she
could
bring
him
to
a
certain
point
beyond
which
he
would
not
go
as
a
matter
of
fact
dave
darrin
secure
in
his
loyalty
to
belle
did
not
perceive
what
maid
marian
was
striving
to
lead
up
to
but
saw
in
her
only
a
lively
and
interesting
girl
i
get
you
yet
midshipman
darrin
she
vowed
to
herself
after
they
had
parted
the
gossip
of
a
sweetheart
in
his
home
town
which
in
time
reached
her
ears
only
made
the
girl
more
determined
to
get
her
way
looking
in
the
mirror
with
satisfaction
she
murmured
there
be
the
added
zest
of
making
midshipman
darrin
forget
the
distant
face
of
that
home
girl
not
on
that
visit
did
maid
marian
succeed
in
leading
dave
beyond
the
point
of
simple
but
sincere
friendship
however
miss
stevens
could
be
charming
to
whomsoever
she
wished
and
before
she
left
annapolis
she
had
secured
invitations
to
visit
the
wife
of
more
than
one
of
the
officers
chapter
xx
conclusion
christmas
came
and
went
and
soon
after
this
the
examinations
were
on
in
earnest
some
of
the
midshipmen
failed
and
sadly
turned
their
faces
homeward
to
make
a
place
for
themselves
in
some
other
lane
of
life
dan
dalzell
however
made
good
his
promise
and
by
a
better
margin
than
he
had
dared
hope
dave
came
through
the
examination
somewhat
better
than
his
chum
both
felt
assured
now
that
they
would
round
out
the
year
with
fair
credit
to
themselves
marian
stevens
came
to
annapolis
several
times
during
the
latter
half
of
the
year
and
as
it
is
expected
that
the
future
officer
shall
have
social
as
well
as
naval
training
dave
darrin
met
her
often
exasperation
that
she
could
draw
the
young
midshipman
on
only
so
far
soon
changed
in
miss
stevens
to
anger
and
chagrin
still
dave
giving
prolonged
thought
to
no
girl
except
belle
meade
saw
in
her
only
a
lively
companion
sometimes
he
was
her
dinner
partner
always
at
a
dance
he
danced
with
her
more
than
once
it
was
at
one
such
dance
that
she
looked
up
as
they
circled
the
room
to
say
i
wonder
if
you
know
darrin
how
much
i
enjoy
dancing
with
you
not
as
much
as
i
enjoy
dancing
with
you
he
replied
smilingly
just
then
the
music
stopped
suddenly
and
an
officer
called
in
a
voice
that
carried
over
the
great
floor
of
the
gymnasium
and
over
all
the
chatter
ladies
and
gentlemen
one
moment
attention
please
in
an
instant
all
was
still
ladies
and
gentlemen
continued
the
officer
official
permission
has
been
granted
for
taking
a
flashlight
photograph
of
the
scene
will
everybody
please
remain
where
he
is
until
after
the
exposure
has
been
made
dave
and
marian
had
paused
directly
in
front
of
the
lens
of
the
camera
maid
marian
looked
up
and
made
a
light
jesting
remark
gazing
straight
into
the
midshipman
eyes
dave
smiling
bent
forward
to
hear
what
she
said
just
then
came
the
flash
and
the
photographer
his
work
finished
for
the
time
gathered
his
paraphernalia
together
and
left
the
music
recommenced
and
the
dancing
proceeded
three
weeks
later
that
photograph
was
reproduced
as
a
illustration
in
one
of
the
prominent
pictorial
weeklies
the
day
the
magazine
was
on
the
newsstands
dan
dalzell
bought
a
copy
entering
their
quarters
with
it
in
his
hand
he
opened
it
at
the
illustration
and
handed
it
to
dave
you
and
miss
stevens
show
up
better
than
any
one
else
dave
remarked
dan
the
photograph
is
a
good
piece
of
work
was
dave
only
comment
he
did
not
wish
to
express
the
annoyance
he
felt
when
he
noted
the
appearance
of
intimacy
between
him
and
marian
whose
beauty
showed
even
in
this
reproduction
i
a
bit
rather
belle
should
see
this
paper
he
admitted
to
himself
david
old
boy
this
picture
would
make
a
good
exhibit
in
a
suit
that
an
unkind
remark
to
make
about
a
fine
girl
like
miss
stevens
said
dave
coldly
dan
stared
then
went
off
pondering
belle
meade
in
her
gridley
home
received
one
day
a
large
square
thin
package
she
saw
the
mark
of
the
annapolis
express
office
and
hastily
snatched
up
scissors
to
cut
the
string
out
came
a
huge
photograph
a
picture
of
an
annapolis
dance
how
thoughtful
of
dave
to
send
it
to
me
then
her
eyes
fell
on
two
figures
around
which
a
ring
had
been
drawn
in
ink
they
were
dave
darrin
and
a
pretty
girl
on
the
margin
of
the
card
had
been
scrawled
in
bold
letters
your
affair
of
the
heart
will
bear
close
watching
if
you
still
cherish
this
was
signed
contemptibly
and
untruthfully
a
friend
uh
murmured
belle
in
hurt
pride
and
loyalty
then
she
said
resolutely
to
herself
i
will
pay
no
attention
to
this
an
anonymous
communication
is
always
meant
to
hurt
and
to
give
a
false
impression
but
there
was
the
picture
before
her
eyes
of
dave
and
the
pretty
girl
in
seemingly
great
intimacy
so
though
she
continued
to
write
to
the
midshipman
and
tried
hard
to
make
her
letters
sound
as
usual
in
spite
of
herself
a
coldness
crept
into
them
that
dave
felt
she
must
have
seen
that
pictorial
weekly
thought
the
boy
miserably
but
as
belle
said
nothing
of
this
he
could
not
write
of
it
the
season
was
well
along
dave
and
dan
sent
belle
meade
and
laura
bentley
invitations
to
one
of
the
later
spring
dances
i
wonder
if
she
come
or
if
she
tiring
of
me
thought
dave
darrin
bitterly
but
belle
answered
accepting
the
invitation
for
laura
and
herself
when
saturday
afternoon
came
both
midshipmen
hurried
to
the
hotel
in
the
town
and
sent
up
their
cards
meade
soon
appeared
saying
the
girls
would
be
down
shortly
are
they
both
well
asked
dave
his
tone
was
as
one
giving
a
meaningless
greeting
but
in
his
heart
he
waited
anxiously
to
hear
what
her
mother
should
say
of
belle
well
yes
but
belle
has
been
moping
around
the
house
a
great
deal
dave
rather
unlike
her
usual
self
replied
meade
slowly
if
meade
deplored
this
dave
darrin
did
not
it
showed
him
at
least
that
the
girl
apparent
coldness
was
not
caused
by
her
interest
in
some
other
young
man
but
when
the
girls
came
in
and
belle
greeted
him
cordially
to
be
sure
but
with
something
of
restraint
his
heart
sank
again
what
the
matter
belle
has
something
gone
wrong
asked
dave
when
dan
was
engaging
the
attention
of
meade
and
laura
nothing
is
all
right
with
you
surely
dave
when
we
alone
i
have
something
to
show
you
i
fear
you
have
an
enemy
here
an
enemy
oh
no
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
what
you
have
to
show
me
it
was
not
long
before
at
a
word
from
dave
dan
took
meade
and
laura
out
for
a
walk
it
was
then
that
belle
got
the
large
photograph
with
the
two
figures
ringed
in
ink
and
showed
it
to
dave
why
what
does
this
mean
some
one
must
have
taken
a
good
deal
of
trouble
to
secure
this
photograph
the
picture
was
taken
for
a
pictorial
weekly
one
can
get
a
photograph
from
which
the
cut
is
made
but
it
is
troublesome
and
possibly
expensive
you
have
an
enemy
then
some
one
bent
on
hurting
you
i
do
know
who
it
could
be
my
how
angry
miss
stevens
would
be
if
she
knew
of
this
miss
stevens
is
that
the
girl
yes
she
visited
here
often
this
year
she
knows
a
number
of
the
officers
wives
she
vivacious
and
always
has
a
good
time
but
nothing
to
me
belle
you
know
that
do
you
i
have
never
doubted
you
dave
let
us
tear
this
up
i
thought
at
first
i
not
show
it
to
you
then
decided
it
was
best
not
to
begin
concealing
things
from
you
but
let
us
not
think
of
the
thing
again
belle
you
a
thoroughbred
and
here
the
matter
dropped
as
far
as
it
was
between
dave
darrin
and
belle
meade
miss
stevens
was
at
the
dance
that
evening
though
she
tried
hard
to
make
that
impossible
dave
did
not
dance
with
her
nor
did
he
introduce
her
to
belle
though
there
again
marian
tried
to
force
this
it
would
have
been
well
for
marian
if
dan
dalzell
had
been
equally
circumspect
this
time
it
was
belle
who
contrived
and
got
the
introduction
to
the
other
girl
but
marian
was
by
no
means
reluctant
so
it
was
that
they
managed
to
get
a
few
moments
alone
together
when
they
had
sent
their
dance
partners
to
get
something
for
them
you
are
a
friend
of
dave
are
you
asked
marian
of
darrin
oh
yes
we
always
known
each
other
then
you
been
here
to
many
of
these
dances
only
two
too
bad
you
could
not
have
been
here
oftener
this
has
been
an
unusually
brilliant
season
really
many
of
the
young
people
have
lost
their
heads
or
their
hearts
i
often
wonder
if
these
midshipmen
have
sweethearts
at
home
this
daring
and
impertinent
remark
was
made
musingly
but
smilingly
these
annapolis
affairs
are
never
very
serious
i
imagine
belle
observed
calmly
on
the
contrary
most
of
the
navy
marriages
date
back
to
an
annapolis
first
meeting
then
you
think
it
well
to
come
often
unless
one
has
other
ways
of
keeping
in
touch
was
the
brazen
reply
i
have
said
belle
sweetly
i
receive
a
good
many
souvenirs
in
the
course
of
a
year
one
last
winter
was
a
photograph
with
the
words
belle
gazed
intently
into
miss
stevens
eyes
then
she
went
on
there
was
an
anonymous
message
written
on
it
it
was
a
lying
message
of
course
as
anonymous
messages
always
are
written
in
a
coarse
hand
did
you
ever
study
handwriting
miss
stevens
marian
gasped
realizing
she
was
this
writing
had
all
the
characteristics
of
a
woman
whose
instincts
are
coarse
that
of
a
treacherous
though
not
dangerous
person
here
sanderson
back
will
you
excuse
me
miss
meade
and
marian
fairly
fled
belle
told
dave
she
had
found
out
who
had
sent
the
photograph
but
added
i
wish
you
would
ask
me
who
it
was
dave
i
can
assure
you
that
the
person
who
did
it
will
never
trouble
us
again
and
as
dave
did
not
like
to
think
evil
of
any
one
he
consented
and
continued
to
think
of
marian
stevens
when
he
thought
of
her
at
all
as
a
jolly
girl
the
annual
examinations
were
approaching
dan
dalzell
was
buried
deep
in
gloom
dave
darrin
kept
cheerful
outwardly
but
doubts
crept
into
his
heart
the
examinations
over
dave
felt
reasonably
safe
but
dan
gloom
deepened
for
he
was
sure
he
had
failed
in
skinny
as
the
boys
termed
chemistry
and
physics
so
it
was
that
when
the
grades
were
posted
dave
scanned
the
d
in
the
list
of
third
classmen
who
had
passed
dan
on
the
other
hand
turned
instantly
to
what
he
termed
the
bust
list
why
why
i
not
there
he
muttered
look
at
the
passing
list
danny
laughed
dave
unbelieving
dan
turned
his
eyes
on
the
list
and
to
his
utter
astonishment
found
his
name
posted
true
in
skinny
he
had
a
bare
passing
mark
but
in
other
subjects
he
was
somewhat
above
the
minimum
so
you
see
old
man
we
both
be
here
next
year
as
second
classmen
said
dave
jubilantly
this
was
as
dave
darrin
said
and
what
happened
during
this
time
may
be
learned
in
a
volume
entitled
dave
darrin
third
year
at
annapolis
or
leaders
of
the
second
class
midshipmen

end
