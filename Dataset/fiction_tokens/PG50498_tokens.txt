chapter
i
a
man
it
was
said
of
jehane
that
she
married
blindly
on
the
she
herself
confessed
in
later
life
that
she
married
out
of
dread
of
becoming
an
old
maid
a
don
daughter
at
oxford
has
plentiful
opportunities
for
becoming
an
old
maid
undergraduates
are
too
adventurously
young
and
graduates
are
too
importantly
in
earnest
for
marriage
whether
too
young
or
too
earnest
they
are
all
too
occupied
to
bring
a
man
to
the
point
of
matrimony
you
must
catch
him
unaware
and
invade
his
idleness
love
in
its
initial
stages
is
frivolous
this
tragic
state
of
affairs
was
frequently
discussed
by
jehane
with
her
best
friend
nan
tudor
were
they
to
allow
themselves
to
fade
husbandless
into
the
autumn
of
girlhood
were
they
too
ladylike
to
make
any
effort
to
save
themselves
from
this
horrid
fate
in
the
gray
winter
as
they
returned
from
a
footer
match
on
the
river
in
summer
as
the
eights
swung
by
in
the
at
cassingland
this
was
their
one
absorbing
topic
of
conversation
ye
gods
were
they
never
to
be
married
they
watched
the
privileged
who
had
it
in
their
power
to
choose
them
that
they
did
not
choose
them
seemed
an
insult
when
term
commenced
they
would
dash
up
to
their
colleges
in
hansoms
and
step
out
confident
and
smiling
they
would
saunter
through
the
narrow
oxford
streets
to
morning
lectures
in
tattered
gowns
smoking
cigarettes
jolly
and
lackadaisical
in
the
afternoon
with
savage
and
awakened
energy
they
would
strive
excessively
for
athletic
honors
at
night
they
would
smash
windows
twang
banjoes
rag
one
another
assault
constables
and
sometimes
get
drunk
at
the
end
of
term
they
would
step
into
their
hansoms
and
vanish
lords
of
creation
in
search
of
a
rest
jehane
contrasted
their
lives
with
nan
and
hers
got
everything
our
hands
are
empty
we
compulsory
nuns
and
may
do
nothing
to
free
ourselves
when
comes
to
my
rescue
if
he
ever
comes
how
i
shall
adore
then
together
they
would
fall
to
picturing
their
chosen
lover
unfortunately
the
choice
was
not
theirs
their
portion
was
to
wait
for
him
to
come
they
knew
of
lean
striding
women
in
north
oxford
who
had
waited
women
whose
hair
had
lost
its
brightness
who
fondled
dogs
and
pretended
to
hate
babies
jehane
and
nan
adored
babies
they
loved
the
feel
of
little
crumpled
fingers
against
their
throats
and
the
warmth
of
a
tiny
body
cuddled
against
their
breasts
they
never
missed
an
opportunity
for
hugging
a
baby
they
never
passed
a
young
mother
in
the
streets
without
a
pang
of
envy
why
was
it
that
no
man
had
chosen
them
gazing
at
their
own
reflections
they
would
tell
themselves
that
they
were
not
jehane
with
her
cloudy
brown
eyes
and
gipsy
mane
of
hair
nan
all
blue
and
flaxen
and
fluffy
the
years
slipped
by
where
was
he
in
the
world
for
eight
years
since
she
was
seventeen
jehane
had
never
ceased
watching
every
new
year
and
birthday
she
had
whispered
to
herself
by
this
time
next
year
he
will
have
marriage
seemed
to
her
the
escape
to
every
happiness
now
that
she
was
she
grew
desperate
from
now
on
with
every
day
her
chance
of
being
one
of
the
chosen
would
diminish
as
she
expressed
it
to
nan
two
girls
adrift
on
a
raft
and
we
swim
over
there
the
land
of
marriage
with
all
the
little
children
the
homes
and
the
husbands
we
no
means
of
getting
to
it
unless
some
of
the
men
see
us
and
put
off
in
boats
to
our
rescue
we
be
caught
in
the
current
of
the
years
and
swept
out
into
the
hunger
of
but
they
too
busy
to
notice
us
oh
dear
when
jehane
spoke
like
this
nan
would
laugh
except
for
jehane
no
such
thoughts
would
have
entered
her
head
they
did
worry
her
when
she
was
with
her
rector
father
at
cassingland
occupied
with
her
quiet
round
of
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
believed
that
life
was
planned
by
an
unescapable
providence
her
placid
philosophy
irritated
jehane
she
said
that
nan
god
was
a
stout
widower
in
a
clerical
band
whereat
nan
would
smile
dreamily
and
answer
it
be
just
ripping
if
god
were
at
such
times
jehane
thought
nan
stupid
that
jehane
should
have
been
so
romantic
about
marriage
was
inexplicable
save
on
the
ground
that
she
voiced
the
passions
which
her
parents
had
suppressed
in
themselves
her
father
professor
benares
usk
was
the
greatest
living
homeric
scholar
a
tall
bowed
man
with
a
broad
beard
that
flowed
down
below
his
a
bald
and
venerable
head
and
a
secret
habit
of
taking
snuff
he
had
lost
interest
in
human
doings
since
greece
was
trampled
by
the
roman
eagles
both
he
and
usk
were
they
had
frictioned
off
the
corners
of
their
personalities
in
the
graveyards
of
the
past
their
minds
were
museums
stored
with
chipped
splendors
the
atmosphere
of
which
was
stuffy
usk
was
an
authority
on
scandinavian
a
thin
woman
who
wore
her
dresses
straight
up
and
down
without
a
bulge
her
soft
gray
hair
was
drawn
tightly
off
her
forehead
and
twisted
at
the
back
into
a
hard
round
walnut
only
on
sunday
afternoons
was
the
house
thrown
open
to
visitors
then
jehane
would
offer
tea
to
young
bloods
while
her
father
fingered
his
beard
and
made
awkward
efforts
to
be
affable
and
her
mother
ignoring
the
guests
sat
bolt
upright
in
her
chair
and
slumbered
what
a
look
of
relief
came
into
the
tanned
faces
of
the
men
when
they
caught
up
their
hats
and
departed
they
had
come
as
a
duty
to
see
not
jehane
but
her
father
and
now
they
went
off
to
their
pleasures
oh
those
sunday
afternoons
how
they
made
her
shudder
often
she
marveled
at
her
parents
what
had
brought
them
together
to
her
way
of
thinking
they
knew
so
little
about
love
and
could
so
easily
have
dispensed
with
one
another
like
dignified
sleepy
they
sat
on
distant
sides
of
the
domestic
hearth
heedless
of
everything
save
to
be
ah
when
she
married
life
would
become
intense
ecstatic
one
throb
of
passion
there
was
a
story
current
in
the
of
how
the
professor
cared
for
usk
he
had
taken
her
for
a
drive
in
a
he
sitting
in
front
and
she
characteristically
by
choice
at
the
back
deep
in
thought
he
had
jolted
through
her
presence
did
not
occur
to
him
till
he
had
returned
to
oxford
and
had
drawn
up
before
his
house
then
he
perceived
that
she
was
not
there
and
must
have
tumbled
out
some
hours
later
having
retraced
his
journey
he
found
her
by
the
roadside
with
a
broken
leg
for
the
next
three
months
the
greatest
living
homeric
scholar
did
penance
wheeling
an
exacting
lady
in
a
bathchair
doubtless
he
planned
his
great
studies
of
the
iliad
as
he
trundled
and
the
chair
occupant
constructed
english
renderings
of
scandinavian
legends
at
all
events
next
autumn
they
each
had
a
book
published
these
were
the
influences
under
which
jehane
grew
up
her
parents
were
more
like
children
to
her
than
parents
gentle
and
utterly
absorbed
in
themselves
they
were
no
earthly
use
when
it
came
to
marriage
she
could
not
apply
to
them
for
help
they
would
have
thought
her
indelicate
if
they
had
thought
about
it
at
all
probably
they
would
not
have
understood
sometimes
marriage
came
to
girls
sometimes
it
did
nobody
was
to
blame
whether
it
did
or
did
that
would
have
been
their
way
of
summing
up
meanwhile
jehane
was
she
had
begun
to
abandon
hope
when
the
great
change
occurred
it
commenced
with
william
barrington
it
was
early
summer
the
streets
had
been
washed
clean
by
rain
and
were
now
haunted
by
strange
sweet
perfumes
which
drifted
over
walls
from
hidden
nan
had
driven
in
from
cassingland
and
had
come
to
jehane
for
lunch
and
shelter
it
was
afternoon
the
sun
was
shining
tearfully
over
glistening
turrets
and
drenched
jehane
unlatched
the
window
and
leant
out
above
the
street
looking
up
and
holding
out
her
hands
from
far
away
out
of
sight
on
the
river
came
the
thud
of
oars
and
hoarse
shouts
where
the
eights
were
practising
halfway
down
the
street
the
tower
of
calvary
soared
incredibly
frail
and
defiant
against
a
running
sea
of
cloud
not
a
drop
if
you
do
believe
me
feel
for
yourself
let
she
drew
back
swiftly
looking
slightly
flustered
from
the
back
of
the
room
nan
voice
came
smooth
and
unhurried
the
matter
why
do
you
finish
what
you
were
saying
a
man
jehane
whispered
in
an
instantly
arranged
conspiracy
nan
tiptoed
over
to
her
friend
cautiously
they
peered
out
no
sooner
had
nan
eyes
found
what
they
sought
than
she
darted
back
jehane
with
rising
color
remained
bending
forward
the
bell
rang
a
few
seconds
later
the
opened
and
shut
jehane
drew
a
long
breath
and
stood
erect
laughing
nervously
she
patted
her
face
with
both
hands
look
scared
you
dear
old
thing
more
fluffy
than
ever
just
like
a
tiny
newly
hatched
chicken
but
it
happened
in
the
world
jehane
how
could
you
do
it
what
know
stare
at
him
like
looked
i
did
stare
why
my
dear
that
what
woman
eyes
were
made
but
you
flung
your
eyes
about
his
neck
you
dragged
him
into
the
and
i
want
to
hide
so
jehane
feigned
a
coolness
which
she
did
not
possess
a
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
nan
buried
her
hot
cheeks
in
a
bowl
of
lilac
a
maid
entered
with
a
card
jehane
looked
up
from
reading
it
know
him
betty
what
made
him
come
betty
looked
her
surprise
see
master
of
course
that
what
he
you
told
him
father
was
out
did
miss
but
he
all
the
way
from
london
seems
the
master
gave
him
an
appointment
he
told
me
to
tell
you
as
you
do
like
father
to
forget
we
going
on
the
river
i
suppose
have
to
see
him
no
nan
i
wo
be
left
by
betty
you
better
show
him
nan
threw
herself
down
on
the
sofa
crushing
herself
into
the
cushions
as
far
from
the
door
as
she
could
get
wish
i
not
come
jehane
why
did
you
do
it
jehane
seated
herself
near
the
window
where
the
light
fell
across
her
shoulder
most
becomingly
she
spread
out
her
skirts
decorously
and
picked
up
a
book
composing
her
features
to
an
expression
of
sweetest
demureness
that
it
was
a
greek
grammar
did
not
matter
in
answer
to
nan
question
she
replied
stupid
nothing
venture
nothing
chapter
ii
half
sick
of
the
strange
man
was
rather
amused
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
but
he
showed
no
amusement
when
he
entered
jehane
laid
aside
her
book
leisurely
and
rose
from
her
chair
he
was
even
better
to
look
at
than
she
had
expected
it
was
his
clothes
that
impressed
her
first
the
gray
tweeds
fitted
his
athletic
figure
with
just
that
maximum
of
good
taste
that
stops
short
of
perfection
then
it
was
his
face
and
intellectual
the
face
of
a
boyish
man
mobile
and
keen
in
expression
she
liked
the
way
he
did
his
dark
brown
hair
almost
as
dark
as
hers
swept
straight
back
without
a
parting
from
his
forehead
his
eyes
were
kindly
piercing
and
for
a
man
he
had
exceptionally
long
thin
hands
she
liked
him
entirely
she
wondered
whether
he
was
equally
well
impressed
thoughtless
of
father
he
out
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
jehane
was
tall
but
she
only
reached
up
to
his
shoulders
his
eyes
looked
down
on
hers
and
twinkled
into
a
smile
at
her
nervous
gravity
all
know
the
professor
there
no
need
to
apologize
please
she
was
about
to
comply
with
his
request
when
she
realized
that
she
no
longer
held
his
attention
he
was
staring
past
her
she
turned
her
head
allow
me
to
introduce
you
barrington
to
my
friend
miss
thought
it
his
tones
had
become
extraordinarily
glad
one
could
forget
little
nan
who
once
known
her
but
nan
you
grown
older
what
do
you
mean
by
it
it
so
uncalled
for
so
unexpected
you
no
longer
the
princess
pepperminta
that
you
nan
crossed
the
room
in
a
romping
bound
and
commenced
pumping
his
arm
up
and
down
billy
dear
old
billy
you
remember
jehane
i
told
you
billy
who
sewed
up
father
surplice
and
billy
who
tied
knots
in
my
hair
and
billy
who
when
i
got
angry
used
to
call
me
the
princess
pepperminta
you
made
yourself
so
detestable
billy
that
our
village
talks
about
you
even
doubtful
compliment
but
it
ripping
to
see
you
simply
jehane
stood
aside
and
watched
them
she
had
heard
nan
talk
of
billy
barrington
and
how
her
father
had
tutored
him
for
oxford
but
that
must
be
twelve
years
back
she
had
never
known
him
herself
and
had
never
been
very
curious
about
him
but
now
as
she
watched
she
felt
the
appeal
of
this
big
boy
of
thirty
they
were
talking
talking
of
things
beyond
her
knowledge
things
which
shut
her
out
why
did
you
write
in
all
these
years
father
and
i
often
mentioned
you
in
cassingland
you
were
an
event
it
was
kind
of
you
at
home
were
in
such
a
mess
i
to
start
work
at
once
somehow
with
working
so
hard
other
things
faded
nan
with
the
rest
i
remembered
you
my
honor
i
did
nan
but
i
thought
were
such
a
kid
in
those
days
i
thought
you
forgotten
as
though
either
of
us
could
forget
i
was
an
jehane
had
turned
her
back
and
was
looking
out
of
the
window
for
the
first
time
she
envied
nan
nan
the
daughter
of
a
country
parson
it
was
too
bad
she
glanced
across
her
shoulder
being
intolerably
rude
talking
all
about
our
own
affairs
you
see
once
nan
was
almost
my
sister
how
old
were
you
nan
thirteen
was
it
and
i
was
eighteen
we
not
met
since
then
my
father
died
suddenly
you
know
i
had
to
step
into
his
shoes
they
were
much
too
big
for
me
that
was
the
end
of
oxford
and
were
going
out
on
the
river
said
jehane
you
join
us
i
sit
very
quiet
and
listen
you
can
talk
over
old
times
to
your
heart
they
piled
his
arms
with
cushions
and
together
set
out
through
the
glistening
meadows
to
the
barges
after
the
rain
the
air
was
intensely
still
sounds
carried
far
from
tall
trees
on
the
broad
walk
and
from
the
uttermost
distance
came
the
fluty
cry
of
birds
from
the
river
the
rattle
of
oars
being
banked
and
from
every
side
the
slow
patter
of
dripping
branches
like
a
canvas
fresh
from
an
artist
brush
colors
in
the
landscape
stood
out
distinct
and
wet
flowers
against
the
gray
walls
of
corpus
trunks
of
trees
with
their
velvety
blackness
and
shorn
greenness
of
the
hinksey
hills
men
in
disreputable
shorts
returning
from
the
boats
passed
them
some
ran
some
sauntered
chatting
barrington
laughed
shortly
and
drew
a
long
breath
to
do
but
enjoy
themselves
nothing
to
do
but
grow
a
fine
body
and
learn
to
be
gentlemen
i
missed
all
that
after
the
rush
and
drive
it
topping
to
sink
right
it
is
sleepy
one
day
just
like
the
next
we
stand
as
still
as
people
come
and
go
we
left
we
exist
for
visitors
to
look
at
like
the
martyr
memorial
and
calvary
he
glanced
down
at
jehane
quickly
she
interested
him
there
was
something
about
her
that
he
could
not
understand
the
long
penciled
brows
the
thick
lashes
the
cloudy
eyes
and
the
straight
pale
features
attracted
and
yet
repelled
him
he
felt
that
she
was
not
happy
and
had
never
been
quite
happy
the
natural
generosity
of
the
man
made
him
eager
to
hear
her
speak
about
herself
but
jehane
was
aware
that
she
had
struck
a
discord
in
what
she
had
said
he
had
flinched
like
a
child
with
whom
the
thought
of
pain
had
not
yet
become
a
habit
she
made
haste
to
cover
up
her
error
by
directing
attention
to
himself
you
what
are
you
a
pub
but
you
ca
be
you
do
mean
that
you
nan
caught
his
arm
in
her
merriment
and
leant
across
him
course
he
does
he
a
publisher
he
always
did
clip
his
not
barrington
father
publisher
barrington
it
funny
jehane
but
it
ca
be
helped
anyhow
he
only
billy
barrington
stood
still
eying
the
two
girls
the
one
fair
and
all
mischief
the
other
dark
and
serious
the
matter
with
you
miss
usk
why
do
you
object
i
told
you
you
might
not
like
then
you
ought
to
have
a
long
gray
beard
like
father
you
not
old
sometimes
thought
that
always
been
young
for
his
age
said
nan
minus
twenty
but
as
they
walked
on
jehane
was
saying
to
herself
he
was
only
coming
to
see
father
as
everybody
comes
it
was
my
face
that
drew
they
strewed
the
cushions
on
the
floor
of
the
punt
barrington
took
the
pole
and
jehane
seated
herself
in
front
so
that
she
could
face
him
all
that
he
should
see
of
nan
attractions
was
the
back
of
her
golden
head
jehane
had
arranged
all
that
they
swung
out
into
unsteadily
barrington
was
struggling
to
recover
a
forgotten
art
their
direction
was
erratic
they
nearly
fouled
a
returning
eight
the
maledictions
of
the
cox
each
stinging
epithet
of
whose
abuse
politely
ended
in
drew
unwelcome
attention
to
their
wandering
progress
when
they
had
collided
with
the
opposite
bank
nan
stood
up
and
took
the
pole
herself
jehane
was
in
luck
she
had
often
pictured
such
a
scene
to
herself
a
man
herself
and
a
punt
on
the
river
in
these
pictures
she
had
never
included
nan
she
had
heard
herself
brilliantly
conversing
saying
amusing
things
that
had
made
the
man
laugh
saying
deep
things
that
had
made
him
solemn
then
presently
she
had
ceased
to
torment
him
his
arms
had
gone
about
her
and
she
had
lain
a
fluttering
wild
thing
on
his
breast
now
in
reality
she
had
nothing
to
say
when
he
spoke
she
gave
him
short
answers
she
was
not
mistress
of
herself
she
trailed
her
hands
in
the
water
and
was
afraid
to
look
up
lest
he
should
guess
the
tumult
in
her
heart
the
punt
had
turned
out
of
the
main
stream
into
the
cherwell
and
was
stealing
between
narrow
banks
jehane
knew
that
she
was
appearing
sullen
she
always
appeared
like
that
with
men
in
her
mind
eye
she
saw
herself
acting
the
other
part
of
gay
responsive
woman
of
the
world
she
was
angry
with
herself
barrington
hampered
by
her
embarrassment
had
twisted
round
on
his
cushions
and
was
chaffing
nan
nan
was
looking
her
best
and
as
usual
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
fact
in
her
loose
blowy
muslin
standing
erect
leaning
against
the
pole
with
the
water
dripping
from
her
hands
she
seemed
the
soul
of
summer
and
unspoilt
girlhood
against
the
background
of
lazy
river
and
green
shadows
there
was
something
infantile
and
appealing
about
nan
her
flaxen
hair
fitted
her
like
a
shining
cap
of
satin
her
eyes
were
inextinguishably
bright
and
blue
above
them
were
delicate
golden
brows
her
red
lips
seemed
always
slightly
parted
ready
to
respond
to
mischief
or
merriment
she
was
small
in
build
the
kind
of
a
man
is
tempted
to
pick
up
and
carry
her
chief
beauty
was
her
long
slim
throat
and
neck
she
was
a
white
flower
swaying
from
a
fragile
stem
it
was
impossible
to
think
that
nan
knew
anything
that
was
not
good
after
they
had
passed
under
magdalen
bridge
they
had
the
river
very
much
to
themselves
the
rain
had
driven
most
of
the
voyagers
to
cover
for
long
stretches
there
was
no
sound
but
their
own
voices
the
splash
of
the
pole
and
the
secret
singing
of
birds
jehane
with
trailing
hands
and
brooding
eyes
watched
this
man
she
wanted
him
she
did
not
know
why
she
wanted
him
for
herself
sometimes
she
became
so
concentrated
in
her
mood
that
she
forgot
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
through
her
head
went
humming
significant
and
disconnected
stanzas
which
she
repeated
over
and
over
when
the
moon
was
overhead
came
two
young
lovers
lately
wed
am
half
sick
of
shadows
said
the
lady
of
jehane
had
once
been
told
that
she
was
in
appearance
she
never
forgot
that
it
explained
her
to
herself
she
had
quarreled
forever
with
a
man
who
had
said
that
rossetti
women
resulted
from
tuberculosis
of
the
imagination
the
truth
of
the
remark
was
unforgivable
she
knew
that
she
herself
suffered
from
some
such
spiritual
malady
a
question
roused
her
from
her
trance
say
billy
are
you
married
yet
it
was
extraordinary
how
jehane
heart
pounded
as
she
waited
for
the
question
to
be
answered
he
clasped
his
hands
in
supplication
not
to
tell
my
wife
that
we
came
out
like
this
nan
let
the
pole
trail
behind
her
and
gazed
down
at
him
mockingly
her
face
was
flushed
with
the
exertion
of
punting
the
faint
gold
of
the
stormy
afternoon
drifting
through
gray
willows
spangled
her
hair
and
dress
you
like
you
can
make
yourself
as
big
an
ass
as
anyone
i
do
believe
you
are
a
pub
you
a
big
lazy
fellow
playing
truant
answer
my
pepperminta
why
should
i
call
me
ridiculous
names
answer
my
barrington
stretched
himself
indolently
on
the
cushions
not
changed
a
bit
you
just
as
funny
and
imperious
as
ever
soon
stamp
your
little
foot
when
that
fails
you
try
coaxing
after
twelve
years
of
being
away
from
you
i
can
read
you
like
a
ca
i
never
coax
now
i
scowl
and
get
angry
and
he
glanced
up
at
her
gentle
laughing
face
could
make
your
face
scowl
however
much
you
jehane
told
herself
that
they
were
two
children
rehearsing
an
old
game
together
people
must
be
very
fond
of
one
another
to
play
a
game
of
pretending
to
quarrel
she
felt
strangely
grown
up
and
out
of
it
and
quite
unreasonably
hurt
nan
was
surprising
her
at
every
turn
enjoy
yourself
much
better
he
was
saying
i
leave
you
in
suspense
you
can
spend
your
time
in
guessing
what
she
looks
like
then
you
can
start
watching
me
closely
to
see
whether
i
love
her
and
then
you
can
wonder
how
much
i
going
to
tell
her
of
what
we
say
to
each
nan
jerked
the
punt
forward
do
want
to
know
you
can
keep
your
secret
to
then
glancing
at
jehane
say
janey
you
ask
him
he
ca
be
rude
to
you
he
have
to
jehane
had
no
option
but
to
enter
into
the
jest
know
father
told
me
barrington
is
a
the
man
eyes
flashed
and
held
hers
steadily
they
twinkled
with
surprise
and
humor
on
miss
usk
you
tell
her
it
altogether
too
while
she
was
speaking
she
was
excitedly
conscious
that
he
was
examining
her
and
approving
her
impertinence
barrington
married
his
mother
soon
after
he
left
cassingland
she
was
a
beautiful
creature
and
very
modest
because
she
felt
herself
unworthy
of
the
brilliant
barrington
she
made
it
a
condition
of
their
marriage
that
it
should
be
kept
secret
then
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
she
was
spoiling
his
promising
career
and
well
she
died
suddenly
of
gas
after
she
was
dead
a
volume
of
poems
was
discovered
love
poems
and
published
anonymously
my
mother
attributes
them
to
bacon
and
my
father
used
to
attribute
them
to
shakespeare
then
father
found
out
but
he
never
dared
to
tell
mother
she
was
always
so
positive
about
nan
had
stared
at
her
friend
while
she
was
talking
could
this
be
the
serious
jehane
what
had
happened
at
the
end
she
broke
into
a
peal
of
laughter
wo
do
old
girl
you
stuffing
billy
has
got
a
he
is
married
he
said
he
does
want
to
be
married
yet
now
are
you
content
jehane
was
not
content
as
they
drifted
through
mesopotamia
with
its
sound
of
running
waters
and
constant
fluttering
of
birds
she
kept
hearing
those
words
he
does
want
to
be
married
did
men
ever
want
to
be
married
or
was
it
always
necessary
to
catch
them
them
it
sounded
horrid
to
put
it
like
that
and
robbed
love
of
all
its
poetry
as
a
girl
with
a
appearance
she
had
liked
to
believe
all
the
legends
of
chivalry
that
it
was
woman
part
to
be
remote
and
disdainful
while
men
endangered
themselves
to
win
her
favor
but
were
those
legends
only
ideals
had
anything
like
them
ever
happened
and
supposing
a
woman
wanted
to
catch
barrington
how
would
she
set
about
it
the
roar
of
water
across
the
lasher
at
parsons
pleasure
grew
louder
drowning
the
conversation
which
was
taking
place
in
low
tones
at
the
other
end
of
the
punt
as
they
drew
in
at
the
landing
jehane
bent
forward
and
heard
barrington
say
believe
you
have
been
disappointed
if
i
had
been
and
nan
retort
believe
i
should
you
know
it
does
make
a
nan
turned
to
jehane
are
we
going
to
do
next
there
hardly
time
to
go
do
go
back
yet
barrington
protested
get
tea
at
marston
who
take
the
punt
round
to
the
ladies
landing
ladies
allowed
through
parsons
pleasure
and
i
hardly
trust
you
to
come
round
by
nan
eyed
him
doubtfully
may
be
a
good
pub
but
you
a
rotten
it
all
you
need
rub
it
in
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
shall
only
get
a
sure
you
can
swim
sure
and
good
luck
i
should
hate
to
lose
you
after
all
these
years
of
as
they
struck
out
along
the
path
across
the
island
and
the
screen
of
bushes
shut
him
from
their
view
jehane
felt
her
arm
taken
you
like
him
janey
i
seen
of
him
was
afraid
you
made
you
think
that
he
thought
it
i
could
feel
that
he
thought
i
did
wore
your
janey
you
looked
so
tragic
and
black
i
had
to
talk
my
head
off
to
fill
in
the
know
you
did
but
i
was
sure
of
the
nan
glanced
up
quickly
and
her
eyes
filled
the
blood
surged
into
her
face
and
throat
her
lips
trembled
she
pressed
her
cheek
coaxingly
against
the
tall
girl
shoulder
foolish
jehane
you
jealous
why
billy
and
i
use
to
eat
blackberries
out
of
each
other
then
jehane
relented
drawing
nan
to
her
with
swift
protecting
passion
she
kissed
the
wet
eyes
and
pouting
mouth
dear
little
nan
i
jealous
you
so
sweet
and
gentle
no
one
could
help
loving
you
i
was
angry
with
myself
angry
because
i
so
much
cleverer
nan
whispered
do
want
to
be
clever
i
give
everything
i
possess
to
look
as
good
and
happy
as
you
are
good
if
you
were
we
should
all
love
it
enough
that
you
when
barrington
rounded
the
island
he
found
them
standing
oddly
near
together
then
he
noticed
a
moist
ball
of
handkerchief
crushed
in
free
hand
and
he
guessed
chapter
iii
all
the
way
for
this
jehane
had
been
granted
her
wish
and
she
was
frightened
the
river
stretched
before
her
a
lonely
ghost
glimmering
between
soaked
fields
and
beaten
countryside
the
must
have
been
heavy
in
the
hills
for
the
river
was
swollen
and
discolored
branches
torn
from
overhanging
trees
danced
and
vanished
in
the
swiftly
moving
current
with
evening
a
breeze
had
sprung
up
which
came
fitfully
in
gusts
bowing
tall
rushes
that
waded
in
the
stream
so
that
they
whispered
in
the
distance
above
clumped
the
spires
of
oxford
speared
the
watery
sky
red
stains
spread
along
white
flanks
of
clouds
clouds
that
looked
like
chargers
spurred
by
invisible
riders
the
man
of
whom
she
knew
so
little
and
whom
she
desired
was
standing
at
her
side
she
was
terrified
she
had
gained
her
wish
at
last
they
were
alone
together
behind
them
up
the
hill
the
cosy
inn
nestled
among
its
quiet
arbors
across
the
river
the
ferryman
sat
whistling
waiting
for
his
next
fare
to
come
up
moving
away
through
misty
meadows
on
the
further
bank
a
white
speck
fluttered
mothlike
get
home
all
right
do
you
think
not
she
always
it
be
late
by
the
time
she
reaches
cassingland
she
got
to
catch
the
tram
into
oxford
to
harness
up
and
then
to
drive
out
to
the
rectory
it
be
late
by
the
time
she
have
been
later
if
she
returned
by
river
with
see
waving
at
the
girls
have
to
do
these
thing
for
themselves
barrington
if
they
have
no
he
stroked
his
chin
who
have
no
brothers
should
be
allotted
brothers
by
the
she
faced
him
daringly
should
like
that
i
might
ask
to
have
you
appointed
my
would
eh
seems
to
me
that
what
funny
what
a
little
customer
nan
is
for
making
her
friends
the
friends
of
one
another
she
was
just
the
same
in
the
old
days
one
might
almost
suspect
that
planned
this
from
the
start
bringing
us
out
all
comfy
and
leaving
us
to
go
home
but
i
say
can
you
punt
can
but
i
not
going
he
stepped
back
from
her
involuntarily
and
eyed
her
there
was
a
thrill
of
excitement
in
her
clear
voice
that
warned
and
yet
left
him
puzzled
she
filled
him
with
discomfort
discomfort
that
was
not
entirely
unpleasant
while
nan
was
present
she
had
been
watchful
and
silent
now
it
was
as
though
she
slipped
back
the
bars
of
her
reticence
and
stepped
out
he
tingled
with
an
unaccustomed
sense
of
danger
he
weighed
his
words
before
expressing
the
most
trifling
sentiment
usually
he
was
recklessly
spontaneous
now
he
feared
lest
his
motives
might
be
mistaken
what
did
she
want
of
him
she
had
gazed
down
from
the
window
and
beckoned
him
with
her
eyes
him
a
stranger
whatever
it
was
nan
knew
about
it
and
had
cried
about
it
the
moment
his
back
was
turned
he
distrusted
anyone
who
made
nan
cry
silence
between
them
was
more
awkward
than
words
surcharged
with
subtle
promptings
that
words
disguised
he
took
up
the
thread
of
their
broken
conversation
you
not
going
to
punt
how
are
we
going
to
get
back
i
do
my
best
but
you
seen
what
a
duffer
i
sit
in
the
stern
and
paddle
with
the
current
running
so
strongly
we
could
almost
drift
he
followed
her
down
the
slope
she
walked
in
front
her
head
slightly
turned
as
though
she
listened
to
make
sure
that
he
followed
he
noticed
the
pride
of
her
handsome
body
its
erectness
and
its
poise
how
it
seemed
to
glide
across
the
grass
without
sound
or
motion
he
summed
her
up
as
being
abnormally
and
wilfully
undiscoverable
he
wondered
whether
her
restraint
hid
a
glorious
personality
or
served
simply
as
a
disguise
for
shallowness
of
and
while
he
analyzed
her
thus
she
was
scorning
herself
for
the
immodesty
of
her
fear
and
dumbness
kneeling
down
on
the
landing
to
unfasten
the
rope
he
pieced
his
words
together
ought
to
apologize
for
what
i
implied
just
now
it
must
have
sounded
horribly
ungallant
to
suggest
that
you
should
work
while
i
sat
she
did
not
answer
till
they
were
seated
side
by
side
in
the
narrow
stern
taking
a
long
stroke
with
her
paddle
she
shot
a
searching
glance
at
him
the
veil
drew
back
from
her
eyes
revealing
their
smoldering
fire
all
right
i
do
trouble
you
need
though
she
had
not
blamed
him
she
had
not
excused
him
night
was
falling
early
outlines
of
the
country
were
already
growing
vague
edges
of
things
were
blurred
from
meadows
silver
mists
were
rising
in
the
great
silence
grasses
rustled
as
cattle
stirred
them
the
river
complained
and
a
solitary
belated
bird
swept
across
the
dusk
with
a
dull
cry
it
was
dangerous
and
it
was
tempting
he
could
not
avoid
personalities
he
tried
to
think
of
other
things
to
say
but
they
refused
to
take
shape
his
perturbation
seemed
the
rumor
of
what
her
mind
was
enacting
several
times
inquisitive
inquiries
were
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
he
checked
them
then
her
body
lurched
against
him
their
shoulders
brushed
have
a
beautiful
you
think
so
me
it
has
only
one
again
she
brushed
against
him
he
caught
the
scent
of
her
hair
and
in
the
twilight
a
glimpse
of
the
heavy
drooping
eyelids
mean
that
poem
by
william
morris
it
all
about
jehane
you
remember
how
it
runs
she
come
all
the
way
for
this
frightened
to
continue
is
that
so
her
tones
were
cold
and
quiet
she
come
all
the
way
for
this
to
part
at
last
without
a
kiss
i
remember
it
all
about
dripping
woods
and
a
country
like
this
with
a
river
overflowing
its
banks
and
a
man
and
a
girl
who
were
parted
forever
the
haystack
in
the
floods
jehane
was
supposed
to
be
a
witch
was
she
the
brown
jehane
the
brown
give
us
jehane
to
burn
or
drown
there
something
like
that
in
the
poem
i
suppose
i
make
you
think
only
of
tragic
things
suppose
that
i
do
most
my
case
there
no
reason
for
supposing
that
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
yes
you
ought
you
felt
it
though
you
did
know
it
unfortunate
for
a
girl
always
to
impress
people
as
tragic
do
you
think
men
like
us
to
be
young
you
so
young
yourself
that
your
hobby
according
to
but
if
you
want
to
know
you
yourself
made
me
think
of
something
not
quite
happy
that
what
kept
me
so
quiet
on
the
way
thought
i
done
something
amiss
that
perhaps
you
were
offended
with
me
for
the
informal
way
in
which
i
introduced
she
gave
him
no
assurance
that
she
had
not
been
offended
what
you
made
me
think
she
said
left
the
web
she
left
the
loom
she
made
three
paces
through
the
room
she
saw
the
bloom
she
saw
the
helmet
and
the
plume
she
look
down
to
nice
is
it
to
find
that
we
had
such
a
cheerful
effect
on
one
another
but
why
on
earth
should
i
make
you
think
of
that
she
left
off
paddling
and
glanced
away
from
him
a
little
shiver
ran
through
her
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
but
still
penetrating
me
ask
you
a
question
do
you
think
that
it
much
fun
being
a
girl
thought
about
it
should
have
supposed
that
for
anyone
who
was
young
and
it
might
be
of
fun
to
be
a
girl
in
i
tell
you
that
it
is
you
always
wanting
and
wanting
wanting
the
things
that
men
have
and
that
only
men
can
give
you
but
they
keep
everything
for
themselves
because
they
like
you
barrington
they
never
thought
about
not
sure
that
i
why
force
me
to
be
so
explicit
take
the
case
of
nan
she
one
of
thousands
she
got
nothing
of
her
own
no
freedom
no
money
no
anything
she
always
under
orders
she
not
expected
to
have
any
plans
for
her
future
she
creeps
to
the
windows
of
the
world
and
peeps
out
when
her
father
is
near
enough
to
prevent
her
unless
she
marries
she
always
be
prying
and
never
sharing
she
a
of
shut
up
in
a
tower
weaving
a
web
of
fancies
she
hears
life
tramp
beneath
her
window
traveling
in
plume
and
helmet
to
the
city
unless
a
man
frees
her
she
never
get
oh
i
ought
to
talk
like
this
i
never
have
to
anyone
except
to
nan
why
do
you
make
me
now
that
it
said
i
hate
do
he
spoke
gently
glad
you
done
it
you
made
me
see
further
we
men
always
look
at
things
from
our
own
i
suppose
we
he
waited
for
her
to
deny
that
he
was
selfish
no
doubt
about
it
she
affirmed
they
paddled
on
in
silence
till
they
came
to
the
lasher
together
they
hauled
the
punt
over
the
rollers
there
was
no
one
about
when
it
had
taken
the
water
on
the
other
side
jehane
stepped
in
quickly
while
his
hands
and
thoughts
were
unoccupied
she
was
afraid
to
be
near
him
he
stood
on
the
bank
holding
the
rope
to
keep
the
punt
from
drifting
his
head
was
flung
back
and
he
did
not
stir
through
the
network
of
branches
moonlight
drifted
making
willows
gnarled
and
twisted
and
water
rushing
from
the
lasher
eerie
and
fantastic
he
was
thinking
of
nan
and
the
meaning
of
her
crying
usk
it
was
very
brave
of
you
to
speak
she
laughed
perversely
she
was
so
afraid
of
revealing
her
emotion
must
have
queer
notions
about
me
i
been
terribly
they
drifted
down
stream
through
mesopotamia
pursued
by
the
silence
when
barrington
spoke
to
her
now
it
was
as
though
there
lay
between
them
a
secret
understanding
what
that
understanding
was
she
scarcely
dared
to
conjecture
here
alone
with
him
in
the
of
shadows
she
was
supremely
at
peace
with
herself
at
magdalen
bridge
they
tethered
the
punt
it
was
too
late
to
return
to
the
barges
outside
her
father
house
they
halted
through
the
window
they
could
see
the
forehead
of
the
professor
as
he
sat
with
his
at
his
elbow
come
in
you
had
some
business
with
father
that
brought
you
down
from
london
it
late
if
you
do
mind
i
prefer
to
see
him
you
staying
for
long
in
oxford
had
you
may
may
it
all
then
till
professor
usk
sank
his
head
as
she
entered
that
he
might
gaze
at
her
above
his
spectacles
again
daughter
been
on
the
river
with
nan
they
tell
me
it
late
for
girls
to
be
out
by
she
answered
hurriedly
barrington
was
with
barrington
nice
fellow
did
he
say
anything
about
my
book
she
was
on
tenterhooks
to
be
by
herself
call
you
been
running
daughter
you
seem
out
of
breath
i
a
minute
or
two
to
spare
come
and
sit
down
tell
me
what
you
been
doing
did
barrington
say
whether
that
book
of
mine
had
gone
to
press
she
backed
slowly
to
the
threshold
and
stood
with
the
handle
in
her
hand
a
headache
she
opened
the
door
and
fled
locking
herself
in
her
room
she
flung
herself
on
the
bed
and
lay
rigid
in
the
darkness
shaken
with
sobbing
pressing
her
lips
against
the
pillow
to
stifle
the
sound
she
commenced
in
a
desperate
whisper
god
give
him
to
me
dear
god
let
me
have
him
oh
god
give
chapter
iv
love
shadow
when
barrington
called
on
the
professor
next
morning
he
did
not
see
jehane
she
had
stayed
in
bed
for
breakfast
to
keep
out
of
his
way
she
did
not
trust
herself
to
meet
him
before
her
parents
because
of
her
face
it
might
tell
tales
she
was
strangely
ashamed
that
anyone
should
know
of
her
infatuation
and
yet
she
longed
to
meet
him
that
she
might
experience
afresh
the
sweet
tingling
dread
lest
he
should
touch
her
ah
if
she
were
sure
that
he
returned
her
love
what
a
different
jehane
he
should
discover
though
she
did
not
meet
him
she
espied
him
the
moment
he
turned
into
the
street
peering
stealthily
from
behind
the
curtain
she
was
glad
to
notice
that
he
glanced
up
as
though
conscious
that
her
hidden
eyes
were
watching
listening
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
heard
his
voice
she
heard
him
inquire
after
her
and
tried
to
estimate
his
disappointment
and
anxiety
when
her
father
answered
casually
daughter
has
one
of
her
headaches
no
nothing
much
she
may
not
be
down
this
after
he
had
left
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
her
cowardice
she
ought
to
have
seized
her
opportunity
perhaps
he
was
returning
at
once
to
london
where
he
would
quickly
forget
her
she
might
never
see
him
again
by
a
kind
of
necromancy
she
tried
to
arrive
at
certainty
as
to
whether
or
no
he
would
marry
her
if
she
could
count
a
hundred
before
a
cart
passed
a
particular
lamppost
then
he
would
become
her
husband
when
the
cart
went
too
fast
for
her
counting
she
skipped
numbers
and
cheated
in
order
to
make
the
test
propitious
sitting
in
her
bedroom
partly
dressed
with
the
brilliant
summer
sunshine
streaming
over
her
she
invented
all
kinds
of
similar
experiments
at
last
she
grew
impatient
of
her
own
company
and
came
downstairs
to
lunch
her
dreamy
mother
who
usually
noticed
nothing
embarrassed
her
by
remarking
that
her
face
was
flushed
as
though
she
were
sickening
for
something
she
turned
attention
from
herself
by
inquiring
the
result
of
her
father
interview
with
barrington
her
father
was
annoyed
because
his
book
had
been
delayed
in
publication
quite
unwarrantably
delayed
he
said
she
could
not
get
him
to
state
whether
barrington
had
gone
back
to
london
the
conversation
developed
into
an
indictment
of
the
innate
trickiness
of
publishers
usk
had
never
been
able
to
reconcile
the
place
she
occupied
in
the
world
of
letters
with
the
smallness
of
her
it
almost
made
her
doubt
the
financial
honesty
of
some
persons
jehane
had
listened
with
angry
eyes
while
these
two
impractical
scholars
comfortably
interrupting
one
another
across
the
table
swelled
out
the
sum
of
their
grievances
now
she
took
up
the
cudgels
so
personally
and
so
passionately
in
the
defense
of
publishers
in
general
and
barrington
in
particular
that
she
was
moved
to
tears
by
her
eloquence
her
parents
peered
at
her
out
of
their
dim
eyes
in
concerned
silence
when
the
tears
had
come
they
nodded
at
each
other
bleating
in
chorus
is
not
well
she
is
flushed
she
is
certainly
sickening
for
something
she
must
go
to
bed
the
doctor
must
be
jehane
pushed
back
her
chair
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
quite
after
she
had
made
her
escape
it
was
discovered
that
she
had
eaten
nothing
in
a
few
minutes
she
reappeared
in
her
attire
and
announced
that
she
was
going
to
cassingland
my
dear
you
ca
her
mother
protested
in
your
state
you
may
give
it
to
nan
it
may
be
catching
and
then
think
how
tudor
would
blame
jehane
tapped
with
her
foot
impatiently
be
silly
mother
and
with
that
she
departed
only
one
of
the
witnesses
of
this
scene
conjectured
its
true
cause
betty
the
housemaid
who
on
more
than
one
occasion
had
watched
these
same
symptoms
develop
in
herself
at
the
stable
where
her
father
horse
was
baited
jehane
ordered
out
the
she
did
not
know
why
she
was
going
to
cassingland
certainly
she
did
not
intend
to
make
nan
her
confidant
the
frenzy
of
love
is
contagious
but
nan
must
know
many
pages
of
barrington
past
the
whole
of
which
was
a
closed
book
to
her
without
giving
away
her
secret
they
might
discuss
him
together
as
she
drove
along
the
woodstock
road
and
turned
off
into
the
leafy
oxford
lanes
she
laid
her
plans
she
would
affect
to
have
found
him
dull
company
in
the
journey
back
from
marston
ferry
she
would
be
surprised
that
anyone
should
think
him
interesting
then
nan
with
her
sensitive
loyalty
to
friends
would
prove
the
splendor
of
his
character
with
facts
drawn
from
her
own
experience
down
the
road
ahead
a
man
was
striding
in
the
direction
in
which
she
was
driving
at
the
sound
of
wheels
he
turned
and
standing
to
one
side
raised
his
hat
blood
flooded
her
cheeks
her
instinct
was
to
dash
by
him
she
could
not
endure
his
attitude
of
secure
comradeship
he
must
be
everything
to
her
at
once
or
nothing
her
eyes
fell
away
from
his
yet
she
longed
to
return
his
gaze
with
frankness
in
luck
when
i
called
this
morning
the
professor
told
me
you
were
glad
i
been
blaming
myself
for
not
taking
sufficient
care
of
had
he
chosen
he
could
have
crushed
her
to
him
then
she
was
made
so
happy
that
she
would
not
have
protested
but
how
was
he
to
judge
this
from
the
proud
almost
sullen
face
that
watched
him
from
the
he
looked
up
at
her
cheerfully
for
the
same
place
are
we
i
tired
of
pounding
along
by
myself
if
you
do
mind
i
jump
in
and
let
you
drive
she
nodded
ever
so
slightly
and
he
swung
himself
up
to
nan
cassingland
he
assented
want
to
see
for
myself
the
lady
in
her
tower
know
i
ca
get
that
out
of
my
head
all
that
you
told
me
about
she
spoke
indifferently
and
flicked
the
horse
with
the
whip
so
that
it
started
forward
with
a
jerk
not
very
curious
you
do
ask
me
why
i
ca
with
other
conditions
it
equally
true
of
do
believe
will
when
i
told
you
to
get
on
nowadays
a
fellow
got
to
work
day
and
ambitious
course
i
am
i
want
to
have
power
i
not
had
a
real
holiday
for
years
of
course
i
money
which
you
say
girls
do
have
but
responsibilities
i
know
nothing
of
women
i
had
no
time
to
learn
that
why
i
so
grateful
to
you
for
yesterday
with
me
it
just
work
work
work
to
win
a
position
so
that
one
day
some
woman
may
be
happy
so
you
see
i
have
my
tower
as
well
as
nan
where
i
doomed
to
spin
my
web
of
men
choose
their
own
towers
build
them
for
you
believe
it
some
few
may
but
so
do
some
few
girls
i
wanted
to
go
to
oxford
and
to
write
books
and
to
be
a
scholar
instead
of
which
i
publish
other
men
scribblings
and
do
my
best
to
sell
never
thought
i
mean
i
thought
all
men
but
you
strong
if
any
man
could
have
chosen
you
would
have
done
it
tell
me
about
and
he
told
her
his
dreams
anxieties
small
triumphs
and
incessant
round
of
daily
duties
he
was
very
fine
and
gentle
speaking
with
touching
eagerness
as
though
confession
were
a
privilege
which
he
rarely
allowed
himself
yet
jehane
was
not
content
she
knew
that
in
love
the
instinct
for
confession
is
coupled
with
the
instinct
for
secretiveness
when
she
touched
him
he
was
not
disturbed
as
she
was
his
voice
did
not
quiver
he
did
not
change
color
she
told
herself
that
men
were
the
masters
so
that
even
in
love
they
showed
no
distrust
of
themselves
but
the
explanation
was
not
convincing
they
were
nearing
cassingland
ambushed
in
trees
rising
out
of
somnolent
lowlands
the
thin
tall
spire
of
a
church
sunned
itself
like
toys
tumbled
from
a
sack
about
which
grass
had
grown
up
cottages
lay
scattered
throughout
the
meadows
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
triangular
green
with
the
tidy
rectory
standing
on
its
edge
their
conversation
faltered
he
offered
her
his
hand
to
help
her
out
she
held
back
for
a
second
then
took
it
with
ashamed
suddenness
he
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
with
a
boy
enthusiasm
usk
it
awfully
decent
of
you
to
have
listened
to
you
who
been
decent
you
make
everything
so
easy
you
seem
seem
to
he
was
puzzled
done
nothing
but
talk
at
unpardonable
length
about
myself
as
for
making
things
easy
it
you
you
so
rippingly
she
winced
no
man
falls
in
love
with
a
woman
for
her
sanity
it
was
as
though
he
had
called
her
or
robust
she
wanted
to
appeal
to
him
as
weak
and
clinging
when
people
are
in
love
they
are
far
from
sensible
she
knew
that
she
was
anything
but
sensible
at
present
if
he
had
told
her
she
was
capricious
and
charming
she
would
have
shown
him
a
face
exultant
nan
came
tripping
to
the
gate
jolly
both
of
you
together
her
coming
was
inappropriate
for
the
next
few
months
all
her
appearances
were
to
prove
so
far
as
jehane
was
concerned
and
yet
what
was
to
be
done
professor
usk
house
was
too
subdued
in
its
atmosphere
to
be
congenial
moreover
the
professor
invariably
monopolized
a
man
who
was
his
guest
especially
when
the
man
was
a
publisher
then
again
jehane
was
painfully
aware
that
she
was
awkward
in
the
presence
of
her
parents
and
did
not
create
her
best
impression
so
she
did
not
encourage
barrington
to
call
on
her
in
oxford
naturally
she
turned
to
cassingland
where
you
had
the
wide
free
country
and
no
one
suspected
or
watched
you
because
you
were
friendly
with
a
man
cassingland
furnished
an
excuse
for
both
of
them
nan
was
her
friend
tudor
had
been
his
tutor
tudor
with
his
honest
appearance
and
frayed
clericals
lent
an
air
of
propriety
to
proceedings
and
nan
she
helped
the
propriety
but
she
never
knew
when
she
was
not
wanted
she
spoke
of
barrington
as
billy
she
took
his
arm
and
snuggled
against
him
with
a
naive
air
of
mischief
leading
him
to
all
the
spots
along
the
river
in
the
garden
and
scattered
through
the
fields
which
years
ago
had
formed
their
playground
jehane
resented
her
innocent
air
of
belonging
to
him
so
very
frequently
when
barrington
came
down
from
london
and
she
drifted
out
as
if
by
accident
to
the
rectory
she
wore
the
mask
of
reserve
and
sullenness
and
did
not
show
to
best
advantage
barrington
for
his
part
was
always
equal
in
his
temper
too
equal
for
jehane
with
nan
he
was
gay
and
frivolous
to
her
he
was
grave
and
deferential
she
wished
he
would
display
more
ardor
and
less
caution
if
it
had
been
in
her
nature
she
would
have
made
the
running
she
was
pained
by
his
unvarying
respect
all
summer
love
shadow
had
rested
on
her
it
was
september
now
the
harvest
lay
cut
in
the
fields
ready
to
be
carried
nan
had
sent
jehane
a
message
that
morning
that
barrington
was
expected
so
here
she
was
once
more
at
the
rectory
spending
the
they
had
gone
up
to
bed
leaving
the
men
to
smoke
suddenly
nan
put
on
her
dress
saying
that
she
heard
her
father
calling
jehane
prepared
for
bed
slowly
by
the
time
she
was
ready
to
slip
between
the
sheets
nan
had
not
returned
she
blew
out
the
candle
the
room
was
instantly
suffused
with
liquid
moonlight
and
velvet
shadow
in
the
darkness
as
often
happens
her
senses
became
sharpened
she
heard
a
multitude
of
sounds
somewhere
near
the
church
probably
from
the
tower
an
owl
was
hooting
in
the
distance
a
dog
barked
she
could
hear
the
wash
of
the
river
among
its
rushes
and
the
padding
of
a
footstep
on
the
lawn
romance
in
her
was
stirred
going
to
the
window
she
leant
out
she
was
greeted
by
the
strong
fragrance
of
roses
sheaves
standing
in
rows
throughout
the
fields
looked
like
a
sleeping
camp
trees
save
where
mists
thumbed
them
were
etched
distinctly
against
the
indigo
horizon
the
white
disc
of
the
moon
like
a
paper
lantern
hung
balanced
between
the
edges
of
two
clouds
its
light
streaming
down
the
sky
was
like
milk
poured
across
black
marble
nature
seemed
to
have
blinded
her
eyes
and
to
hold
her
breath
across
the
lawn
from
the
open
study
window
a
shaft
of
gold
slanted
making
the
darkness
on
either
side
intense
by
contrast
as
jehane
listened
she
heard
what
seemed
a
panting
close
to
the
wall
beneath
her
she
leant
further
out
and
discerned
a
blur
of
white
she
was
about
to
speak
when
the
red
glow
of
a
cigar
thrown
down
among
the
bushes
warned
her
last
you
never
given
me
a
chance
to
be
alone
with
you
wanted
you
all
summer
little
his
arms
were
round
her
as
he
stooped
above
her
her
face
was
blotted
out
he
was
speaking
again
father
saw
it
that
why
he
called
you
if
i
had
to
wait
much
longer
i
should
have
asked
you
before
her
why
why
would
you
never
let
us
be
alone
together
nan
voice
came
muffled
beneath
his
kisses
billy
darling
i
wanted
to
play
an
answer
followed
so
softly
whispered
that
it
did
not
carry
a
surprised
exclamation
from
the
man
jehane
had
tiptoed
from
the
window
with
her
black
hair
tumbled
about
her
her
hands
pressed
against
her
mouth
she
lay
sobbing
the
night
had
lost
its
magic
nan
entered
the
room
stealthily
she
glanced
toward
the
bed
thinking
jehane
was
sleeping
she
did
not
light
the
candle
but
commenced
to
fumble
at
her
fastenings
undressing
in
the
dark
a
sob
refused
to
be
stifled
any
longer
nan
paused
in
her
undressing
and
stood
tense
then
ran
and
bent
above
the
bed
seizing
jehane
by
the
shoulders
she
tried
to
turn
her
face
toward
her
janey
i
did
i
did
play
fair
i
told
you
every
time
he
was
coming
say
you
still
be
but
jehane
said
nothing
next
morning
she
greeted
barrington
with
her
accustomed
mixture
of
proud
restraint
and
sullenness
been
expecting
this
all
summer
we
wondered
when
it
would
happen
i
hope
you
be
very
after
that
she
came
less
frequently
to
cassingland
the
lovers
had
long
walks
uninterrupted
unaccompanied
once
he
told
nan
ca
believe
it
pepperminta
i
sure
you
were
i
she
shook
her
curly
head
sadly
they
rarely
mentioned
jehane
they
knew
that
she
was
troubled
but
they
knew
of
no
way
in
which
to
help
at
christmas
when
snow
lay
on
the
ground
they
were
married
nan
who
had
never
feared
spinsterhood
greatly
had
escaped
from
it
jehane
retired
to
the
isolation
which
she
sometimes
called
her
tower
and
at
other
times
her
raft
she
often
told
herself
savagely
that
had
it
not
been
for
her
shyness
in
instancing
nan
instead
of
herself
on
that
journey
down
from
marston
ferry
she
might
have
been
the
bride
at
that
wedding
secretly
she
was
bitter
about
it
outwardly
she
kept
up
her
friendship
otherwise
she
would
have
seen
no
more
of
barrington
chapter
v
enter
peter
and
glory
barrington
did
everything
on
a
large
scale
he
knew
he
was
going
to
be
a
big
man
he
arranged
his
surroundings
with
an
eye
to
his
expanding
future
it
was
so
when
he
bought
his
house
at
topbury
it
had
more
rooms
than
he
could
furnish
more
than
a
young
married
couple
could
comfortably
occupy
but
he
intended
to
spend
his
entire
life
there
hanging
the
walls
with
memories
and
associations
of
affection
it
would
be
none
too
large
for
a
growing
family
that
was
barrington
all
over
he
planned
and
looked
ahead
the
house
stood
high
in
the
north
of
london
it
was
one
of
twenty
in
a
terrace
all
with
porches
and
areas
in
front
and
long
walled
gardens
at
the
back
the
octopus
suburbs
throwing
out
tentacles
of
small
mean
dwellings
have
crept
across
the
broad
views
and
strangled
the
rural
aspect
but
when
nan
and
barrington
went
to
live
there
they
looked
out
from
their
uninterrupted
across
the
vale
of
holloway
to
gospel
oak
and
the
heath
at
hampstead
the
approach
to
topbury
terrace
was
through
quiet
fields
where
sheep
were
grazing
the
oldest
inhabitants
still
talked
of
a
group
of
shops
as
topbury
village
many
of
the
roads
were
private
traffic
was
kept
back
by
gates
or
posts
planted
across
them
the
house
was
a
hundred
years
old
spacious
and
lofty
it
had
the
sturdy
look
of
eighteenth
century
handiwork
though
standing
in
a
terrace
it
retained
its
own
personality
and
seemed
to
hold
itself
aloof
from
its
neighbors
once
had
stood
before
its
doors
and
coaches
had
rumbled
through
islington
village
out
from
london
bringing
its
master
home
from
routs
and
functions
probably
he
was
a
portly
merchant
accompanied
by
a
dame
who
wore
patches
adjoining
its
bedrooms
were
its
lower
windows
were
heavily
grated
against
attack
all
the
entries
were
massively
screened
and
bolted
it
seemed
to
boast
its
privacy
in
the
garden
were
a
mulberry
and
a
cedar
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
was
a
stable
with
stalls
for
three
horses
at
first
nan
was
rather
awed
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
many
of
the
rooms
remained
unfurnished
that
was
to
be
done
slowly
by
picking
up
old
and
rare
articles
pictures
and
tapestries
as
they
could
afford
them
a
piece
here
and
a
piece
there
this
was
to
be
their
hobby
she
was
frightened
by
so
much
emptiness
and
clung
to
her
husband
puzzled
and
proud
then
gradually
she
began
to
understand
they
were
planning
for
the
future
greatness
which
they
were
to
share
she
was
no
longer
frightened
she
was
glad
there
was
one
room
in
which
they
often
sat
sometimes
they
would
visit
it
separately
and
surprise
one
another
when
they
entered
they
became
strangely
bashful
and
childlike
it
was
holy
ground
they
left
all
their
cruder
ambitions
on
the
threshold
they
stopped
talking
or
conversed
in
whispers
holding
hands
it
was
on
a
halfstory
between
the
first
floor
and
the
second
and
looked
into
the
garden
up
the
wall
outside
a
magnolia
clambered
against
its
window
a
laburnum
tapped
and
shed
its
golden
tassels
everything
was
waiting
for
someone
who
was
some
day
coming
a
high
guard
stood
about
the
hearth
to
prevent
someone
when
he
began
to
toddle
from
falling
into
the
fire
and
getting
burnt
a
little
bed
was
ready
a
bed
so
tiny
that
you
could
lift
it
with
one
hand
on
the
floor
toys
lay
scattered
everything
had
been
thought
out
for
his
reception
long
before
he
warned
them
of
his
coming
to
bring
home
new
toys
and
leave
them
there
for
nan
to
discover
was
one
of
absurd
ways
of
telling
her
how
much
he
loved
her
it
was
in
that
room
that
they
kissed
after
their
first
quarrel
it
was
there
she
told
him
that
the
little
hands
were
being
fashioned
that
were
to
be
held
so
fast
in
theirs
and
he
came
one
bright
february
morning
when
crocuses
were
standing
bravely
above
the
turf
and
a
warm
spring
wind
was
blowing
nan
hugged
him
to
her
breast
smiling
and
crying
she
was
so
glad
he
was
a
man
they
called
him
peter
after
the
house
his
father
said
because
the
house
was
peterish
and
william
was
sure
to
be
contracted
to
bill
or
billy
one
billy
was
enough
in
any
family
it
was
shortly
after
the
birth
of
peter
that
jehane
caught
her
man
it
was
said
that
she
married
him
on
the
rebound
for
she
never
ceased
loving
barrington
she
did
it
more
to
get
off
the
raft
and
to
show
that
she
could
do
it
than
for
anything
captain
bobbie
spashett
had
seen
her
portrait
in
a
friend
house
he
was
under
orders
to
sail
for
india
he
had
six
weeks
in
which
to
make
her
acquaintance
do
his
courting
and
get
over
the
wedding
he
proved
himself
a
man
of
energy
managing
the
business
with
a
soldier
dash
then
he
sailed
for
india
promising
to
send
for
her
when
he
was
settled
unfortunately
before
the
year
was
out
he
died
in
action
in
february
almost
on
the
anniversary
of
peter
birth
his
daughter
came
into
the
world
jehane
named
her
glory
because
of
the
distinguished
nature
of
her
father
death
when
captain
spashett
affairs
came
to
be
settled
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
his
widow
something
less
than
a
thousand
pounds
from
all
sources
then
jehane
discovered
that
in
stepping
off
the
raft
she
had
not
reached
the
land
she
went
to
live
with
her
parents
chapter
vi
jehane
second
marriage
it
was
his
own
fault
he
knew
it
in
after
years
barrington
was
partly
responsible
for
jehane
second
marriage
it
was
he
who
suggested
that
since
jehane
was
not
happy
with
her
parents
it
would
be
decent
to
ask
her
up
to
topbury
for
christmas
did
he
like
her
well
hardly
he
felt
that
she
bore
him
a
grudge
whenever
her
name
was
mentioned
he
and
nan
had
a
guilty
sense
they
were
so
happy
they
had
everything
that
she
coveted
and
lacked
they
asked
her
by
way
of
atonement
when
she
objected
that
glory
would
be
a
nuisance
they
replied
that
glory
would
be
fun
for
and
it
was
he
who
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
invited
waffles
ocky
waffles
was
not
his
sort
his
very
name
was
a
handicap
a
man
named
waffles
could
scarcely
command
respect
but
the
christian
name
made
it
worse
how
could
anyone
called
ocky
waffles
be
a
gentleman
he
was
his
cousin
however
and
lived
alone
in
london
lodgings
his
mother
was
recently
dead
whatever
his
shortcomings
he
had
been
an
attentive
son
the
chap
would
be
rottenly
lonely
thought
barrington
unadulterated
ocky
he
could
not
stand
but
if
he
could
jumble
him
up
in
a
and
so
get
him
diluted
he
would
be
very
glad
to
do
him
a
service
in
the
uncalculating
days
of
boyhood
they
had
been
warm
friends
so
tudor
was
persuaded
to
come
from
cassingland
and
ocky
was
invited
in
her
year
jehane
traveled
to
paddington
for
her
second
adventure
in
matrimony
glory
was
with
her
a
baby
just
beginning
to
toddle
the
image
of
her
soldier
father
jehane
still
wore
mourning
deepest
black
with
white
frills
at
her
wristbands
and
a
white
ruff
about
her
neck
black
suited
her
pale
complexion
it
lent
her
the
touch
of
helpless
pathos
that
her
beauty
had
always
wanted
her
manner
was
hushed
and
gentle
matching
her
costume
her
large
dark
eyes
had
that
forlorn
expression
of
i
can
never
forget
which
has
so
often
sealed
the
fate
of
an
unmarried
man
you
felt
at
once
that
the
finest
deed
possible
would
be
to
bring
her
happiness
at
least
so
felt
waffles
but
that
christmas
there
were
times
when
she
did
forget
in
her
new
surroundings
where
she
and
glory
were
no
longer
burdens
she
grew
almost
merry
when
memory
clouded
her
eyes
and
restored
the
sternness
of
tragedy
it
was
not
bobbie
spashett
she
remembered
who
had
died
a
very
gallant
gentleman
fighting
for
his
country
it
was
simply
that
with
proper
care
nan
shoes
might
have
been
hers
when
she
saw
barrington
slip
his
arm
about
his
wife
and
heard
her
whisper
please
billy
not
now
it
made
her
wild
with
envy
she
felt
that
it
was
more
than
she
could
bear
she
was
unloved
and
so
was
waffles
they
had
this
in
common
despite
dissimilarities
ocky
waffles
was
a
lounger
he
was
always
late
for
everything
which
left
him
plenty
of
time
to
devote
to
her
his
best
friends
would
never
have
accused
him
of
refinement
his
mind
was
untidy
he
was
lazy
and
ineffectual
his
faculty
for
conversation
was
childish
he
he
was
continually
making
silly
jokes
at
which
he
laughed
himself
because
the
world
rarely
laughed
with
him
he
believed
that
his
bump
of
humor
was
abnormally
developed
he
had
met
only
one
person
as
humorous
as
himself
his
mother
she
admiring
and
loyal
old
lady
had
laughed
till
the
tears
came
at
anything
he
said
but
she
was
dead
he
had
lost
his
audience
he
missed
her
and
was
extremely
sorry
for
ocky
waffles
no
one
understood
his
now
after
the
mustard
and
at
father
they
did
not
even
know
to
what
they
referred
he
had
to
explain
everything
there
was
an
element
of
absurdity
and
weak
pathos
about
the
man
when
one
of
his
jokes
had
missed
fire
he
would
dab
his
eyes
saying
with
a
catch
in
his
throat
dear
how
mother
have
split
her
sides
at
that
jehane
was
genuinely
moved
to
compassion
sinking
her
voice
she
would
lead
him
aside
and
whisper
it
again
waffles
i
think
i
could
before
ocky
met
her
the
denseness
of
his
friends
had
driven
him
to
public
houses
where
other
tales
might
be
told
without
shocking
anybody
with
barmaids
he
could
pass
for
a
a
witty
fellow
grief
drove
him
to
it
he
told
himself
he
was
well
aware
that
public
houses
were
bad
for
his
pocket
and
worse
for
his
health
when
jehane
seemed
to
applaud
him
his
thoughts
naturally
turned
to
marriage
marriage
would
cure
every
evil
and
then
oh
then
he
would
become
like
barrington
with
a
loving
wife
and
a
fine
house
it
was
only
a
matter
of
keeping
steady
and
concentrating
your
willpower
but
to
become
like
barrington
he
would
have
had
to
be
a
gentleman
a
never
sat
on
his
head
as
if
it
belonged
to
him
with
his
equals
in
birth
and
opportunity
he
could
never
be
comfortable
he
found
it
easy
to
be
chatty
with
and
servants
this
he
attributed
to
his
superior
humanity
he
was
fond
of
walking
down
the
street
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
when
he
sat
on
a
chair
it
was
usually
on
the
middle
of
his
back
with
his
feet
thrust
out
he
slouched
through
life
like
an
awkward
boy
experiencing
discomfort
in
the
presence
of
his
elders
since
he
could
not
cure
himself
of
his
habits
he
determined
some
day
when
he
was
ready
for
the
effort
to
get
money
with
money
his
habits
would
no
longer
be
bad
they
would
become
signs
of
democracy
and
independence
at
the
time
of
the
christmas
party
he
was
a
clerk
in
a
lawyer
office
he
had
been
other
things
before
that
this
was
his
worldly
condition
when
he
met
jehane
and
fell
in
love
with
her
they
drifted
together
from
force
of
circumstance
nan
and
barrington
were
still
very
much
of
lovers
tudor
spent
his
time
on
the
floor
with
peter
and
glory
they
were
thrown
together
there
was
no
escape
from
it
ocky
was
naturally
affectionate
it
was
part
of
his
weak
amiability
to
love
somebody
he
craved
love
for
himself
or
was
it
admiration
but
as
a
rule
no
one
was
flattered
by
his
affection
it
was
always
on
tap
jehane
did
not
know
that
her
wounded
pride
was
soothed
because
he
selected
her
she
was
hungry
for
a
man
appreciation
and
anxious
for
his
protection
and
as
for
ocky
to
whom
no
one
ever
listened
he
was
encouraged
by
her
pleased
attention
he
sought
her
out
at
first
in
a
effort
to
dispel
her
melancholy
his
method
was
to
regale
her
with
worn
chestnuts
she
heard
them
with
a
slow
sweet
smile
on
her
mouth
which
narrowed
and
widened
but
rarely
broke
into
mirth
this
showed
him
that
all
his
stories
were
new
to
her
the
poor
fellow
was
stirred
to
his
shallow
depths
a
gusty
passion
blew
through
him
he
struggled
into
seeming
strength
he
felt
he
was
a
when
you
choosing
a
woman
who
will
be
condemned
to
hear
all
your
old
anecdotes
over
and
over
to
the
day
of
her
death
it
is
very
necessary
to
select
one
to
whom
they
will
come
fresh
at
least
before
marriage
yes
she
was
the
wife
for
waffles
little
confidences
grew
up
between
them
she
told
him
about
barrington
hinting
that
he
had
wobbled
between
her
and
nan
and
he
told
her
about
barrington
how
as
boys
they
had
been
like
brothers
spending
every
holiday
together
but
now
but
now
in
barrington
own
words
a
little
of
ocky
went
a
long
way
after
an
hour
or
two
in
his
company
he
felt
quite
fed
up
with
him
as
with
many
a
clever
man
vulgarity
of
mind
disgusted
him
more
than
viciousness
he
found
it
difficult
to
hide
his
feelings
from
his
guest
in
fact
he
did
nan
was
the
first
to
notice
what
was
happening
making
love
to
jehane
i
declare
her
husband
shook
his
head
knowingly
too
proud
for
he
is
they
always
sitting
over
the
fire
oh
so
closely
and
whispering
ca
be
she
amusing
herself
if
i
thought
it
were
i
stop
it
ocky
may
be
a
bounder
but
he
would
do
boy
he
doing
he
hardly
got
a
penny
to
bless
himself
and
her
little
income
would
attract
may
say
what
you
like
old
obstinate
it
does
alter
jehane
was
proud
as
barrington
said
but
not
too
proud
she
realized
quite
well
what
waffles
was
but
she
hoped
to
brace
him
up
with
her
strength
she
was
by
no
means
blind
to
his
shortcomings
often
when
the
smile
was
playing
about
her
mouth
her
mind
was
in
a
ferment
of
derision
at
night
remorse
pursued
her
the
fine
clean
memory
of
bobbie
but
the
constant
sight
of
nan
and
barrington
their
stolen
kisses
and
were
getting
on
her
nerves
she
looked
down
the
vista
of
the
years
was
no
man
ever
to
conquer
her
was
she
to
grow
into
an
old
woman
with
that
one
brief
memory
of
her
so
drew
her
to
waffles
despite
the
warnings
of
her
better
sense
the
was
continually
quickened
by
the
sight
of
domestic
happiness
when
after
a
week
acquaintance
he
said
spashett
will
you
marry
me
she
replied
brave
husband
i
can
not
i
must
be
true
to
the
when
he
asked
her
again
two
days
later
she
was
less
positive
waffles
there
me
ocky
he
said
then
he
changed
his
tactics
he
argued
his
loneliness
their
community
of
grief
the
loss
of
his
mother
when
he
spoke
of
his
mother
she
liked
him
best
me
time
she
murmured
the
crisis
came
on
the
last
day
of
her
visit
and
was
hastened
by
two
foolish
happenings
she
detested
the
thought
of
the
return
to
her
parents
silent
house
she
had
persuaded
herself
that
she
was
not
wanted
there
her
child
fidgeted
the
old
people
and
disarranged
the
household
after
the
glimpse
of
warmth
and
heaven
she
had
had
she
magnified
her
troubles
through
the
glass
of
envy
oh
to
have
her
own
fireside
and
her
own
man
this
was
how
the
crisis
happened
peter
aged
three
was
playing
with
glory
with
the
clumsiness
of
childhood
he
knocked
her
down
she
commenced
to
scream
loudly
so
loudly
that
she
might
have
been
seriously
hurt
jehane
rushed
into
the
nursery
caught
her
baby
to
her
breast
and
in
her
anguish
smacked
peter
peter
in
all
his
young
life
had
never
been
smacked
he
watched
her
and
then
set
up
a
terrified
howl
when
nan
arrived
on
the
scene
he
was
sobbing
and
explaining
that
he
had
only
meant
to
glory
which
was
his
word
for
loving
her
by
rubbing
her
with
his
face
and
hands
a
quarrel
ensued
between
the
mothers
in
which
bitter
things
were
said
how
did
jehane
dare
to
touch
peter
her
little
peterkins
baby
who
was
always
so
sensitive
and
gentle
nan
was
fiercely
angry
that
her
child
had
been
unjustly
punished
jehane
was
no
less
angry
because
her
child
had
been
knocked
down
when
it
was
all
over
the
babies
were
told
to
kiss
one
another
peter
when
jehane
approached
him
hid
his
face
in
his
mother
skirt
strained
relations
followed
which
made
light
words
impossible
barrington
when
he
heard
of
it
was
extraordinarily
annoyed
waffles
because
she
was
in
the
minority
sided
with
jehane
that
her
quiet
adoration
of
glory
should
have
turned
into
tigerish
protective
passion
attracted
him
strangely
that
evening
barrington
had
some
friends
to
dine
with
him
men
and
women
of
his
world
whose
good
opinion
he
valued
during
dinner
and
afterwards
in
the
drawingroom
waffles
had
been
ousted
from
the
conversation
their
talk
was
all
of
books
and
travel
things
he
did
not
understand
he
felt
crowded
out
he
resented
it
and
was
determined
to
show
them
that
he
also
could
be
clever
he
waited
for
an
a
pause
in
the
conversation
occurred
he
sprang
into
the
gap
that
he
was
irrelevant
did
not
matter
a
good
riddle
the
other
day
wonder
if
any
of
you
can
answer
all
eyes
turned
in
his
direction
he
cleared
his
throat
and
fumbled
at
his
collar
a
cat
ate
a
haddock
and
a
dog
chased
the
cat
and
the
cat
jumped
over
the
wall
what
relation
would
the
dog
bear
to
the
haddock
there
was
embarrassed
silence
every
face
wore
a
puzzled
expression
barrington
pulled
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
gazed
sternly
at
the
glowing
ash
at
last
a
lady
who
wrote
poetry
took
compassion
on
him
she
tapped
him
on
the
arm
ca
think
of
any
answer
put
me
out
of
my
suspense
so
anxious
to
waffles
beamed
his
acknowledgments
the
answer
he
said
eagerly
is
any
barrington
ceased
to
be
vexed
with
his
cigar
and
laughed
coldly
must
mind
my
cousin
he
a
genial
ass
sometimes
it
takes
him
like
let
see
what
were
we
discussing
when
we
were
interrupted
so
there
were
two
people
with
wounded
feelings
in
that
company
ocky
saw
jehane
slip
out
of
the
room
and
he
followed
on
the
stairs
she
halted
are
you
following
not
wanted
confound
their
why
should
you
follow
me
you
the
same
as
i
am
that
why
you
left
you
not
at
home
here
look
how
they
behaved
about
glory
i
say
it
our
last
evening
together
wo
you
give
me
but
ridiculous
as
it
appeared
to
her
an
almost
maidenly
fear
took
hold
of
her
she
fled
he
found
her
in
the
dark
at
the
top
of
the
tall
house
she
was
leaning
over
her
child
cot
sobbing
he
grew
out
of
himself
stronger
better
against
her
will
he
folded
her
to
him
you
give
me
your
answer
darling
silence
be
very
good
to
still
silence
jehane
i
so
foolish
such
a
weak
foolish
fellow
i
need
your
strength
with
you
i
could
be
a
then
all
that
was
maternal
awoke
in
her
she
remembered
how
she
had
seen
him
looking
while
those
clever
men
and
women
had
stared
mus
mind
my
cousin
a
genial
ass
sometimes
it
takes
him
like
cruel
cruel
she
took
his
head
and
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
kissing
him
on
the
forehead
nan
disturbed
by
their
disappearance
found
them
kneeling
beside
glory
that
night
as
she
sat
before
her
mirror
undressing
she
let
her
hands
fall
to
her
side
listless
barrington
stole
up
behind
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
neck
rubbing
his
face
against
hers
what
peter
calls
you
were
thinking
of
peter
little
did
you
know
that
looked
sad
what
the
trouble
she
bent
back
her
head
so
that
their
eyes
met
and
their
lips
were
near
to
touching
i
had
been
there
that
day
would
you
have
loved
jehane
instead
i
was
in
love
with
you
when
we
played
together
at
cassingland
why
ask
foolish
questions
it
do
mean
she
taken
him
and
i
sure
she
does
want
barrington
drew
himself
upright
then
stooped
over
her
he
was
realizing
the
perfect
joy
of
his
own
union
with
a
startled
sense
of
thankfulness
people
he
murmured
three
months
later
jehane
was
married
the
wedding
was
quiet
there
were
none
but
no
one
felt
that
it
was
an
affair
to
boast
about
it
took
place
from
the
professor
house
at
oxford
tudor
performed
the
ceremony
glory
was
being
left
with
nan
till
the
honeymoon
was
ended
all
morning
jehane
face
had
been
gloomy
perhaps
she
already
had
her
doubts
certainly
waffles
did
not
show
to
advantage
in
art
oxford
atmosphere
he
was
too
boisterous
his
shoes
were
too
shiny
the
colors
of
his
tie
and
clashed
his
clothes
looked
at
parting
with
her
mother
jehane
did
the
unexpected
she
wept
on
their
drive
to
the
station
through
austere
streets
with
bright
glimpses
of
college
quadrangles
and
young
bloods
in
and
sauntering
bareheaded
waffles
grew
more
exuberant
and
irrepressible
his
gaiety
grated
on
her
nerves
having
taken
their
seats
in
the
carriage
the
train
was
delayed
in
starting
he
hung
his
head
out
of
the
window
jerking
jocular
remarks
to
her
across
his
shoulder
she
did
not
answer
him
but
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
cast
down
he
could
not
make
her
out
up
to
now
she
had
responded
so
readily
to
his
merriment
at
all
costs
he
must
make
her
laugh
the
was
passing
down
the
platform
his
hands
clasped
beneath
his
flapping
not
every
guards
the
to
a
seat
of
learning
this
particular
felt
the
full
importance
of
his
position
and
carried
himself
with
his
stomach
thrust
forward
and
his
head
thrown
back
waffles
leant
from
the
window
and
beckoned
frantically
when
the
official
came
up
he
commenced
to
jabber
in
invented
gibberish
desperately
gesticulating
with
his
hands
understand
you
the
official
said
tartly
talk
no
foreign
waffles
paused
in
his
torrent
of
palaver
and
winked
solemnly
at
a
group
of
undergraduates
who
stood
watching
they
happened
to
be
pupils
of
the
professor
then
as
though
an
inspiration
had
burst
upon
him
he
inquired
français
i
do
not
snapped
the
annoyed
that
his
lack
of
scholarship
should
be
exposed
in
this
manner
he
was
moving
away
when
waffles
produced
his
crowning
witticism
to
which
all
the
rest
had
been
preface
jehane
would
certainly
laugh
now
does
this
train
go
to
oxford
he
had
one
glimpse
of
the
insulted
official
countenance
then
he
felt
himself
grabbed
by
the
arm
and
drawn
violently
back
into
the
carriage
you
want
to
make
me
ashamed
of
you
already
sit
down
and
behave
darling
be
quiet
are
you
ever
solemn
is
nothing
sacred
exceedingly
puzzled
and
utterly
extinguished
he
did
as
he
was
bade
waiting
like
a
small
boy
expecting
to
be
spanked
that
was
how
they
began
life
together
chapter
vii
the
whistling
angel
peter
can
quite
well
remember
the
events
which
led
up
to
that
strange
happening
not
that
the
events
or
the
happening
seemed
strange
at
the
time
they
grew
into
his
life
so
naturally
he
thought
if
he
thought
at
all
that
to
all
little
boys
came
the
same
experience
he
would
not
have
believed
you
had
you
told
him
otherwise
he
had
recently
achieved
his
fourth
birthday
and
the
garden
which
was
his
nursery
was
with
tremulous
that
night
his
mother
sent
away
the
nurse
and
undressed
and
bathed
him
herself
she
wanted
to
be
foolish
to
her
heart
content
laughing
and
singing
and
crying
over
him
only
the
slender
laburnum
with
the
kind
old
peering
over
its
shoulder
watched
them
through
the
window
the
laburnum
was
a
young
girl
his
mother
told
him
with
shaky
golden
curls
the
mulberry
whose
arms
were
propped
with
crutches
was
her
grandfather
as
peter
mother
squeezed
the
sponge
down
his
back
she
stooped
her
pretty
head
kissing
some
new
part
of
his
wet
little
body
as
though
she
were
making
a
discovery
and
she
called
him
peterkins
precious
lamb
ownest
and
she
pushed
him
away
from
her
saying
he
did
not
belong
to
her
that
so
she
might
feel
the
eager
arms
clasped
more
fiercely
about
her
neck
when
he
had
been
rolled
in
the
towel
his
big
father
entered
and
took
him
rubbing
his
prickly
chin
against
peter
neck
nor
would
he
give
him
up
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
was
popped
into
his
pink
woolly
nightgown
even
then
when
he
was
safe
in
bed
they
stayed
by
him
his
mother
humming
softly
while
his
father
knelt
to
be
able
to
kiss
her
without
bending
shadows
came
out
from
the
cupboard
and
crept
toward
the
window
pushing
back
the
daylight
the
daylight
dodged
across
the
ceiling
hid
in
the
mulberry
where
it
slept
till
morning
came
back
and
peeped
in
at
him
tenderly
and
vanished
his
eyes
grew
heavy
the
next
thing
he
remembers
is
an
early
breakfast
a
cab
at
the
door
and
being
told
to
be
the
goodest
little
boy
in
the
world
he
was
hugged
till
he
was
breathless
then
he
saw
the
face
of
his
beautiful
mother
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
leaning
out
of
the
throwing
kisses
growing
distant
and
yet
more
distant
down
the
terrace
in
later
years
he
knew
where
they
went
to
switzerland
to
their
honeymoon
at
the
time
he
thought
they
were
gone
forever
grace
his
nurse
did
her
best
to
comfort
him
blowing
his
nose
so
severely
that
he
looked
to
see
if
it
had
come
off
in
the
handkerchief
for
grace
he
had
a
great
respect
she
was
a
lump
of
a
girl
who
beat
a
drum
for
the
salvation
army
under
and
fought
a
never
ending
battle
with
herself
to
pronounce
her
name
correctly
barrington
had
threatened
that
the
penalty
for
failing
was
dismissal
now
the
violence
of
her
emotion
and
the
absence
of
her
employers
made
her
reckless
little
round
tummy
grice
taik
care
of
you
do
you
blow
bubbles
like
that
you
cry
yourself
dry
that
you
will
and
drown
an
awful
suggestion
he
pictured
the
flooded
with
his
tears
the
furniture
floating
and
grace
swimming
for
her
life
he
turned
off
the
tap
to
just
the
littlest
dribble
if
he
stopped
at
once
grace
would
have
ceased
to
be
sorry
she
did
not
keep
her
promise
to
take
care
of
him
on
the
contrary
she
conducted
him
through
london
on
the
tops
of
buses
and
left
him
at
a
strange
house
it
belonged
to
the
lady
a
name
which
he
had
given
to
jehane
since
an
unfortunate
occurrence
previously
mentioned
he
had
been
taught
to
call
her
auntie
to
her
face
but
she
went
by
the
other
name
inside
his
head
on
many
points
his
memories
of
this
period
are
muddled
when
he
was
not
in
disgrace
he
was
allowed
to
play
with
glory
if
he
had
been
specially
good
he
was
privileged
to
splash
in
the
same
bath
with
her
before
being
put
to
bed
but
this
was
not
often
it
appeared
that
quite
suddenly
since
coming
to
the
smacking
lady
house
he
had
developed
an
extraordinary
faculty
for
being
bad
she
said
that
he
was
spoilt
and
shut
him
up
in
rooms
to
make
him
better
he
did
his
best
to
improve
for
he
believed
that
his
naughtiness
was
the
cause
of
his
mother
absence
she
would
never
come
back
unless
he
became
goodest
little
boy
in
the
to
judge
by
the
smacking
lady
countenance
he
did
his
best
to
no
purpose
her
man
was
the
one
bright
spot
in
his
tragedy
and
even
he
seemed
a
little
afraid
of
her
he
did
not
champion
peter
in
her
presence
but
he
would
take
him
out
of
rooms
oh
so
stealthily
and
carry
him
to
the
end
of
the
garden
where
a
river
ran
along
the
floor
of
which
fishes
flashed
pursued
by
their
shadows
there
he
would
tell
him
funny
stories
stories
of
peter
world
and
within
the
compass
of
understanding
and
he
would
laugh
first
to
warn
peter
when
he
was
going
to
be
really
funny
peter
had
again
been
bad
shut
up
in
a
room
and
rescued
by
the
smacking
lady
husband
they
were
sitting
on
the
screened
from
the
windows
of
the
house
by
bushes
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
running
it
was
the
servant
she
spoke
loudly
with
excitement
and
seemed
out
of
breath
the
funny
man
face
became
grave
he
rose
and
left
peter
without
a
word
after
that
all
kinds
of
people
came
hurrying
they
banged
on
the
door
and
went
swiftly
up
the
stairs
swiftly
and
softly
no
one
paid
him
any
heed
and
strange
to
say
they
were
equally
careless
of
glory
he
was
glad
of
that
for
he
loved
glory
it
made
him
happy
to
have
her
to
himself
all
that
day
they
played
among
the
flowers
he
following
the
shining
of
her
little
golden
head
when
she
fell
asleep
tired
he
sat
solemnly
beside
her
holding
her
crumpled
hand
that
night
they
were
hastily
undressed
by
a
stranger
and
tumbled
into
the
same
bed
she
was
so
strange
that
she
did
not
know
that
she
ought
to
hear
them
say
their
prayers
it
was
peter
who
reminded
her
lying
awake
in
the
darkness
he
was
sensitive
that
something
unusual
was
happening
up
and
down
the
creaking
stairs
many
footsteps
came
and
went
dresses
rustled
voices
muttered
in
whispered
consultation
in
intervals
between
doors
opening
and
shutting
there
were
long
periods
of
silence
during
one
of
these
he
heard
a
sound
so
curious
that
he
sat
up
in
bed
a
weak
thin
wailing
which
was
new
to
him
and
had
he
known
it
new
to
the
world
he
gathered
the
to
his
mouth
and
listened
voices
on
the
stairs
grew
bolder
almost
glad
peter
was
conscious
of
relief
from
suspense
night
itself
grew
less
black
again
a
door
opened
on
the
lower
landing
there
were
footsteps
a
man
spoke
cheerfully
all
over
and
successfully
thank
god
for
and
the
smacking
lady
husband
roared
little
nipper
all
my
own
by
gad
peter
did
understand
but
they
let
him
see
next
morning
a
puckered
thing
wrapt
in
blue
flannel
with
the
tiniest
of
hands
lying
very
close
to
aunt
jehane
breast
it
was
the
funny
man
who
showed
him
lifting
him
up
so
he
could
look
down
on
it
the
funny
man
was
happy
did
he
start
asking
questions
at
once
or
does
he
only
imagine
it
perhaps
someone
tried
to
explain
things
to
him
it
may
have
been
his
friend
the
funny
man
it
may
have
been
that
he
overheard
conversations
and
misconstrued
them
at
all
events
he
knew
that
the
baby
was
a
girl
and
that
she
had
come
several
weeks
before
she
was
expected
someone
said
that
master
peter
would
never
have
been
there
had
they
known
that
this
was
going
to
so
babies
came
from
somewhere
suddenly
somebody
sent
them
this
was
the
beginning
of
his
longing
to
have
a
baby
all
to
himself
but
how
one
fine
morning
the
treacherous
grace
arrived
not
one
little
bit
abashed
she
told
him
that
his
mother
was
coming
back
to
topbury
am
i
the
goodest
little
boy
in
the
world
she
thumped
her
great
arms
round
him
he
might
have
been
her
drum
she
was
playing
can
be
when
you
like
and
my
word
i
believe
you
are
he
learnt
before
he
left
that
the
new
baby
was
to
be
called
and
he
noticed
this
much
that
its
hair
and
eyes
were
black
his
mother
had
lost
her
whiteness
her
face
and
hands
were
brown
only
her
hair
was
the
old
sweet
color
he
had
not
been
long
with
her
when
he
made
his
request
get
peterkins
a
she
was
sitting
sewing
by
the
window
she
looked
up
from
the
little
garment
she
was
making
holding
the
needle
in
her
hand
a
funny
present
why
does
little
peter
ask
for
that
where
does
babies
come
from
she
laid
aside
her
work
and
took
him
into
her
lap
god
brings
them
mummikins
does
they
know
to
bring
them
she
laughed
nervously
then
checked
herself
seeing
how
serious
was
the
child
expression
ask
god
darling
he
tells
the
angels
they
bring
the
babies
all
wrapt
up
warmly
in
their
softy
wings
and
a
little
boy
ask
him
could
ask
he
send
me
one
for
my
very
ownest
day
you
asked
god
to
send
me
muvver
and
your
daddy
he
lay
so
quietly
in
her
arms
that
she
thought
his
questions
were
at
an
end
she
did
not
take
up
her
work
but
sat
smiling
with
dreamy
eyes
humming
and
resting
her
chin
on
his
curly
head
he
clambered
down
from
her
knee
satisfied
and
laughing
him
again
you
and
daddy
just
then
barrington
entered
daddy
to
ask
for
now
then
nancy
tears
in
your
eyes
what
peter
been
doing
she
held
her
husband
very
closely
looking
shy
and
happy
been
asking
for
the
thing
we
prayed
what
that
baby
funny
little
beggar
extraordinary
sweet
whispered
nan
here
young
his
father
was
solemn
but
his
eyes
were
laughing
he
held
peter
between
his
knees
so
their
faces
nearly
met
your
mother
asks
god
for
a
baby
sister
will
you
always
be
good
to
her
the
truliest
goodest
little
brother
in
the
world
and
peter
nodded
emphatically
his
father
shook
his
chubby
hand
sealing
the
bargain
peter
watched
hourly
for
her
coming
he
never
doubted
it
would
be
a
he
would
inquire
several
times
daily
it
be
soon
there
was
always
the
same
answer
peterkins
one
night
he
heard
the
same
sounds
that
had
amazed
him
at
the
smacking
lady
house
whispers
running
on
the
stairs
doors
opening
and
shutting
he
waited
for
the
weak
thin
wailing
but
that
did
not
follow
nevertheless
he
was
sure
it
had
happened
wrapt
up
warmly
in
softy
god
had
sent
him
a
sister
for
himself
it
was
very
late
when
grace
came
to
bed
peter
pretended
to
be
asleep
he
feared
she
would
be
angry
slowly
he
raised
himself
on
the
pillow
his
eyes
clear
and
undrowsy
master
peter
she
turned
from
the
mirror
so
startled
that
as
she
spoke
the
fell
from
her
mouth
a

master
peter

enough
you

your
teeny

peter
lay
down
his
little
heart
choking
why
would
grace
tell
him
grace
up
i
of
me
in
the
morning
the
hushed
suspense
still
hung
about
the
house
when
he
raised
his
piping
voice
grace
shook
him
roughly
at
breakfast
his
father
brows
were
puckered
he
was
a
bit
happy
like
the
funny
man
when
the
table
had
been
cleared
he
laid
aside
his
paper
and
sat
peter
on
his
knee
before
him
happened
last
night
sonny
got
a
little
a
sister
daddy
peter
cried
at
that
no
wonder
they
were
all
so
sad
we
asked
god
for
a
sister
all
day
as
he
played
in
a
whisper
by
himself
he
tried
to
think
things
out
god
had
become
confused
at
the
last
moment
or
the
angel
had
the
wrong
baby
had
been
brought
to
their
house
but
where
was
the
right
one
that
evening
the
angel
remembered
his
error
and
took
the
baby
back
peter
was
being
undressed
for
bed
and
grace
was
crying
terribly
she
had
just
slipped
him
into
his
long
pink
nightgown
when
his
father
came
in
hurriedly
he
caught
him
up
wrapping
a
blanket
round
him
and
ran
with
him
downstairs
the
door
of
the
room
which
he
had
watched
all
day
was
opened
by
a
man
in
black
the
room
was
in
darkness
save
for
a
shaded
lamp
there
were
several
people
present
all
of
them
whispered
and
walked
on
tiptoe
he
raised
himself
up
in
his
father
arms
on
the
bed
his
mother
lay
weak
and
listless
her
eyes
were
blue
and
vacant
she
seemed
to
have
shrunk
and
tears
stole
down
her
cheeks
unheeded
her
hair
seemed
heavy
for
her
head
and
lay
across
the
pillow
in
two
broad
plaits
in
her
arms
was
a
little
bundle
the
man
in
black
commenced
to
talk
huskily
no
one
answered
everyone
listened
to
what
he
said
suddenly
he
stooped
to
take
the
bundle
from
his
mother
but
her
arms
tightened
keep
him
as
long
as
god
lets
so
the
man
drew
aside
the
wrappings
peter
saw
the
face
of
a
tiny
stranger
already
tired
of
the
world
the
man
in
black
spoke
some
words
more
loudly
and
touched
the
stranger
face
with
water
peter
shuddered
it
was
cruel
to
wet
his
face
like
that
they
all
stood
silent
in
the
shadows
all
except
peter
who
cuddled
against
his
father
shoulder
someone
said
gone
and
the
sobbing
commenced
that
night
peter
slept
in
his
mother
bedroom
she
would
have
it
she
seemed
frightened
that
an
angel
so
careless
might
carry
him
away
as
well
so
they
set
up
his
cot
by
the
side
of
her
bed
as
she
lay
on
her
pillows
she
could
watch
him
mummikins
got
happy
slowly
she
seemed
disappointed
in
god
gradually
peter
learnt
that
although
the
baby
had
been
left
at
the
wrong
house
they
had
given
him
a
name
and
had
called
him
philip
but
the
old
question
worried
peter
the
one
which
no
one
seemed
able
to
answer
where
was
the
sister
god
had
meant
to
send
and
which
his
father
had
promised
since
everyone
treated
him
with
reticence
he
took
the
matter
up
with
god
himself
often
when
his
mother
bent
above
him
and
thought
him
sleeping
he
was
talking
with
god
inside
his
head
as
a
result
the
strange
thing
happened
in
his
room
to
the
left
of
his
bed
was
a
large
even
in
the
full
of
shadows
one
night
he
had
been
praying
out
loud
to
himself
but
his
voice
was
growing
weary
and
his
eyelids
kept
falling
as
he
lay
there
coming
from
the
cupboard
very
softly
very
distant
he
heard
a
sound
of
whistling
it
was
a
little
air
happy
and
haunting
trilled
over
and
over
he
sat
up
and
listened
not
at
all
frightened
he
thrust
himself
up
with
his
elbows
his
head
bent
forward
in
listening
ecstasy
his
father
could
whistle
but
not
like
that
a
man
whistling
was
shrill
and
strong
this
was
gentle
and
glad
like
a
violin
played
high
up
ah
yes
like
his
mother
whistling
then
somehow
he
knew
that
a
girl
lips
formed
that
sound
he
slipped
out
of
bed
in
the
darkness
and
tiptoed
to
the
cupboard
he
opened
the
door
it
stopped
when
he
was
safe
in
bed
it
again
commenced
as
though
it
were
saying
coming
i
coming
little
peterkins
do
be
it
was
trying
to
say
more
than
that
and
he
racked
his
brains
to
understand
when
he
lay
quiet
and
was
almost
asleep
the
picture
formed
he
saw
a
standing
in
a
garden
watching
god
at
his
work
and
what
was
god
doing
he
was
making
a
little
sister
for
peter
stitching
her
together
and
every
time
the
angel
stopped
whistling
god
needle
dropped
and
every
time
she
recommenced
god
laughed
and
plucked
feathers
from
her
softy
wings
to
make
garments
for
the
little
sister
peter
named
her
the
whistling
angel
one
day
when
she
and
god
were
ready
she
would
bring
his
little
sister
to
him
the
last
thing
he
heard
as
his
sleepy
eyes
closed
on
the
pillow
was
that
happy
haunting
little
air
like
a
tune
played
high
up
on
a
violin
faintly
faintly
coming
i
coming
little
peterkins
do
be
it
was
like
the
rustle
of
wind
in
an
angel
wings
who
had
already
set
out
on
the
journey
chapter
viii
coming
peter
took
all
the
credit
to
himself
she
was
his
baby
and
why
not
nobody
not
even
his
mother
or
father
had
had
anything
to
do
with
her
advent
for
many
months
after
philip
short
sojourn
his
mother
had
cried
and
his
father
had
frowned
whenever
babies
were
mentioned
had
it
not
been
for
peter
the
little
sister
might
have
slipped
god
memory
peter
gave
him
no
chance
to
forget
every
night
kneeling
between
the
with
his
lips
against
the
pillow
to
muffle
the
sound
he
reminded
god
he
realized
that
this
attitude
was
not
respectful
and
always
apologized
in
his
prayers
he
did
it
because
big
people
understand
if
they
caught
him
kneeling
beside
the
bed
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
fall
asleep
there
and
get
so
of
course
when
she
came
she
belonged
to
him
but
her
coming
was
not
yet
he
had
no
end
of
trouble
in
getting
her
after
he
had
heard
the
whistling
he
tried
to
tell
grace
about
it
this
happened
the
very
next
morning
she
had
risen
late
and
was
dressing
him
in
a
hurry
in
order
to
get
him
down
in
time
for
breakfast
she
hardly
listened
to
him
at
all
but
jerked
him
this
way
and
that
buttoning
and
tying
and
tucking
oh
my
there
only
emptiness
inside
your
little
this
mornin
you
must
left
your
brains
beneath
the
pillow
what
a
lot
o
talk
about
was
nothing
grace
i
really
and
truly
heard
then
no
young
man
god
and
writin
it
all
there
grice
did
mean
to
be
but
you
talk
your
tongue
clean
out
o
your
grace
i
did
i
did
it
was
like
he
pursed
his
lips
together
only
a
splutter
came
grace
rubbed
his
face
vigorously
with
the
flannel
leaving
a
taste
of
soap
in
his
mouth
should
my
new
she
was
trying
to
create
a
diversion
can
make
a
winder
rattle
in
its
frame
it
that
loud
and
shrill
the
noise
do
make
if
you
a
good
boy
maybe
i
get
to
teach
you
he
was
bursting
with
his
strange
new
knowledge
he
was
sure
his
mother
would
understand
while
his
father
was
at
the
table
he
kept
silent
his
father
soon
hurried
away
the
slammed
he
plucked
at
his
mother
skirt
night
god
was
in
my
darling
little
boys
ought
to
say
things
like
that
not
even
in
fun
heard
him
mummikins
an
angel
was
with
him
doing
like
he
puffed
out
his
cheeks
but
he
was
so
clever
as
the
angel
no
sound
came
his
mother
gazed
long
into
the
eager
face
trying
to
detect
mischief
is
that
what
you
mean
but
angels
do
whistle
one
did
in
our
cupboard
in
my
he
wagged
his
head
solemnly
in
affirmation
then
he
drew
down
his
mother
face
she
was
smiling
to
herself
was
making
our
baby
he
whispered
the
angel
was
waiting
to
bring
the
rain
came
into
her
eyes
that
was
what
peter
called
it
my
dearest
that
all
over
you
my
only
baby
she
pressed
him
to
her
he
could
feel
her
shaking
just
then
he
knew
nothing
more
must
be
said
many
times
he
tried
to
tell
her
one
evening
while
the
angel
was
whistling
she
tiptoed
into
his
bedroom
looking
up
through
the
darkness
he
saw
her
and
seized
her
excitedly
about
the
neck
there
mummy
do
you
hear
her
she
whistling
he
pronounced
it
peter
dunno
but
listen
she
opened
the
cupboard
door
there
stopped
when
you
did
to
sleep
my
precious
you
dreaming
if
there
was
anything
mother
would
have
heard
it
as
so
he
learnt
to
keep
his
secret
to
himself
no
one
seemed
able
to
share
it
every
now
and
then
he
would
stop
in
his
playing
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
face
intent
those
who
watched
would
see
him
creep
upstairs
and
peep
into
the
big
dark
cupboard
strangely
enough
whatever
he
thought
he
heard
he
did
not
appear
frightened
when
the
doctor
was
called
to
examine
him
he
said
very
imaginative
child
oh
dear
no
he
quite
well
he
grow
out
of
that
fancy
you
old
chap
at
the
back
of
his
mother
mind
was
the
terror
that
she
was
going
to
lose
him
she
kept
him
always
with
her
when
that
dreamy
look
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
turned
his
head
expectantly
she
would
snatch
him
to
her
breast
as
though
someone
lurked
near
to
take
him
from
her
and
peter
lay
still
in
her
arms
and
smiled
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
angel
leant
over
the
banisters
and
whistled
softly
coming
i
coming
little
but
peter
was
anxious
to
make
god
hurry
it
was
grace
who
taught
him
how
her
faith
came
in
spasms
although
she
beat
the
drum
for
the
salvation
army
her
fervor
had
its
ups
and
downs
she
used
to
tell
peter
when
her
went
wrong
she
was
overwhelmed
with
doubt
and
refused
to
go
on
parade
can
carry
the
drum
she
would
say
speaking
of
her
maker
do
look
after
me
no
better
i
done
with
it
awright
i
do
care
can
please
if
can
do
without
me
i
can
do
without
so
these
confidences
made
peter
feel
that
god
was
an
excessively
accessible
person
one
evening
kneeling
in
his
mother
lap
with
folded
hands
he
surprised
her
by
adding
to
the
petition
she
had
taught
him
look
here
god
i
tired
of
waiting
i
wants
at
this
point
he
was
stopped
by
a
gentle
hand
pressed
firmly
over
his
mouth
ca
think
what
come
to
peter
she
told
her
husband
speaks
so
crossly
to
god
in
his
grace
said
barrington
laughing
mark
my
words
better
talk
to
but
i
so
frightened
when
he
does
like
that
billy
do
you
think
he
stopped
her
promptly
i
do
the
boy
all
seeing
how
her
lips
trembled
he
took
her
in
his
arms
never
grown
out
of
your
short
frocks
you
so
timid
you
golden
little
it
was
after
grace
had
been
spoken
to
that
she
made
it
up
with
her
maker
when
this
occurred
peter
was
with
her
in
the
dimly
lit
hall
where
the
soldiers
of
salvation
gathered
she
was
sitting
beside
him
sulkily
on
the
back
bench
nearest
the
door
suddenly
she
rose
and
dashed
forward
in
a
storm
of
weeping
while
the
penitent
knelt
by
the
platform
the
man
who
was
waving
his
arms
went
on
talking
peter
was
growing
frightened
for
her
when
she
jumped
to
her
feet
seizing
a
tambourine
which
she
banged
and
shook
above
her
head
and
shouted
cleansed
i
partly
because
of
her
strength
and
partly
because
of
her
righteousness
she
was
allowed
to
carry
the
drum
again
and
march
in
the
front
of
the
procession
peter
was
impressed
after
that
when
he
had
been
impatient
with
god
he
would
seek
forgiveness
by
declaring
himself
he
always
thought
that
following
such
confessions
the
whistling
came
louder
from
the
cupboard
but
it
was
uncle
waffles
who
completed
his
information
at
intervals
he
would
come
over
to
topbury
with
aunt
jehane
so
far
as
the
ladies
were
concerned
the
talk
was
usually
about
their
children
aunt
jehane
would
rarely
fail
to
mourn
the
fact
that
hers
were
both
girls
are
different
she
would
say
can
turn
them
out
to
sink
or
swim
but
girls
sooner
or
later
one
has
to
get
them
married
it
like
my
fortune
to
have
two
of
them
the
luck
was
with
you
from
the
perhaps
that
was
jehane
way
of
reminding
nan
that
she
had
given
her
husband
only
peter
waffles
seemed
to
construe
it
in
that
light
for
when
she
had
repeated
her
complaint
more
than
twice
he
would
tuck
peter
under
one
arm
and
glory
under
the
other
and
steal
away
to
some
hidden
place
where
he
could
ask
him
funny
questions
if
he
heard
a
cock
crowing
he
would
stop
and
inquire
does
the
the
little
boy
almost
always
forgot
the
proper
answer
uncle
waffles
would
have
to
tell
him
he
does
peter
soon
learnt
that
uncle
waffles
had
secrets
as
well
for
when
he
talked
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
he
would
hold
his
chin
in
his
hand
so
as
to
be
able
to
slip
his
fingers
quickly
over
his
mouth
if
he
found
that
unwise
words
were
escaping
if
he
were
too
late
in
slipping
up
his
fingers
she
would
say
quite
sharply
do
be
stupid
you
no
better
than
a
it
was
because
uncle
waffles
was
no
better
than
a
child
that
peter
took
courage
to
ask
him
does
people
have
babies
his
uncle
regarded
him
seriously
a
moment
very
little
to
ask
such
questions
it
a
great
secret
if
i
tell
you
promise
to
keep
it
to
when
he
had
promised
his
uncle
whispered
and
peter
knew
that
it
was
true
for
he
remembered
that
someone
had
been
lazy
and
had
had
breakfast
in
bed
before
the
coming
of
both
riska
and
philip
so
he
learnt
the
last
piece
of
witchcraft
by
which
babies
are
induced
to
come
into
the
world
from
then
on
until
it
happened
he
was
continually
coaxing
his
mother
not
to
get
up
to
breakfast
one
morning
she
took
his
advice
then
he
knew
for
certain
that
uncle
waffles
was
very
wise
even
though
aunt
jehane
did
call
him
stupid
for
some
time
the
whistling
had
been
growing
bolder
it
would
come
out
of
the
cupboard
as
though
the
angel
were
running
it
would
wander
all
over
the
house
and
meet
him
in
the
most
unexpected
places
when
he
was
playing
in
the
garden
it
would
drift
down
to
him
from
the
peterkins
it
had
grown
quick
like
that
as
though
it
too
were
impatient
of
waiting
two
years
had
gone
by
since
god
had
sent
philip
and
taken
him
back
so
suddenly
it
was
within
a
few
days
of
the
anniversary
and
very
close
to
christmas
all
day
the
sky
had
been
heavy
with
clouds
it
was
bitterly
cold
outside
peter
had
been
kept
in
the
nursery
with
a
big
red
fire
blazing
everyone
seemed
busy
they
opened
the
door
now
and
then
to
make
sure
that
he
was
all
right
and
left
him
to
play
by
himself
toward
evening
the
clouds
burst
like
great
pillows
swollen
with
feathers
softly
softly
covering
up
bare
trees
putting
the
world
to
sleep
beneath
a
great
white
counterpane
the
snow
came
down
he
woke
in
the
night
it
was
like
a
lark
singing
right
beside
his
bed
it
was
the
old
haunting
little
air
that
it
sang
but
so
much
quicker
coming
sometimes
it
sank
into
the
faintest
whisper
sometimes
it
would
swell
into
a
sound
so
loud
and
happy
that
even
grace
sweetheart
could
not
have
whistled
louder
grace
turned
drowsily
and
seeing
him
sitting
up
drew
him
down
beneath
the
clothes
putting
her
arms
about
him
no
she
had
not
heard
it
in
the
morning
his
mother
breakfast
was
carried
upstairs
and
his
father
looked
worried
peter
grew
afraid
lest
he
had
done
wrong
and
a
little
sister
was
not
wanted
so
he
hid
himself
in
the
big
dark
cupboard
in
the
bedroom
and
was
not
missed
for
hours
presently
voices
wandered
up
and
down
the
house
sometimes
sounding
quite
near
and
sometimes
quite
distant
peter
where
are
you
they
seemed
afraid
to
call
louder
peter
had
his
suspicions
so
he
kept
quiet
they
did
not
want
her
and
they
knew
that
he
had
done
it
someone
said
the
other
voices
sank
into
silence
now
it
was
only
his
father
that
he
heard
peterkins
father
wants
you
do
be
frightened
he
going
to
tell
you
something
so
peter
came
out
when
he
saw
his
father
face
he
knew
that
he
was
not
angry
did
want
her
too
did
you
did
you
daddy
course
i
did
you
rummy
little
chap
but
how
did
you
know
who
told
you
although
he
coaxed
and
rubbed
his
scrubby
chin
against
peter
neck
he
never
got
an
answer
to
that
question
where
was
the
good
of
answering
either
you
had
ears
like
peter
or
you
had
chapter
ix
kay
and
some
others
she
filled
all
his
thoughts
the
world
had
become
new
to
him
were
no
longer
amusing
just
to
be
peter
with
a
little
strange
sister
was
the
most
fascinating
story
imaginable
it
was
easy
to
keep
him
good
grace
had
only
to
threaten
that
he
should
not
see
her
see
her
he
lived
for
that
early
in
the
morning
he
was
at
the
bedroom
door
waiting
for
the
nurse
to
look
out
and
beckon
as
he
followed
her
in
on
tiptoe
his
golden
little
motherkins
would
turn
on
her
pillow
holding
out
her
hand
she
was
prettier
than
ever
now
if
peter
had
known
the
word
he
would
have
said
she
looked
that
was
what
he
felt
and
she
seemed
to
have
grown
younger
she
appeared
immature
as
a
girl
so
slim
and
pale
stretched
out
in
the
broad
white
bed
her
hair
lay
in
shining
pools
between
the
counterpane
mountains
you
no
older
than
peter
he
had
heard
his
father
tell
her
a
kiddy
playing
with
dollies
not
a
mother
it
he
knew
from
watching
his
father
that
if
they
had
loved
her
before
they
must
love
her
ten
thousand
times
better
now
when
he
went
for
his
walks
with
grace
he
spent
his
pennies
to
bring
her
home
flowers
everything
in
that
room
had
been
brightened
to
welcome
the
little
sister
it
had
a
sense
of
whiteness
and
a
soft
sweet
fragrance
they
had
to
make
the
little
sister
feel
that
they
were
glad
she
had
come
and
wanted
her
to
stay
so
a
fire
was
kept
burning
in
the
grate
they
spoke
in
whispers
and
walked
on
their
toes
the
way
one
does
in
church
climbing
on
a
chair
he
would
seat
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
while
his
mother
eyes
laughed
at
him
from
the
pillow
managed
it
this
time
little
presently
the
nurse
would
turn
back
the
sheet
and
show
him
the
stranger
cuddled
in
his
mother
breast
he
would
see
a
shining
head
like
fine
gold
scattered
on
white
satin
same
as
yours
the
same
as
yours
when
anyone
found
him
in
any
way
like
her
peter
was
if
he
waited
patiently
the
blue
eyes
would
open
and
stare
straight
past
him
seeing
visions
of
another
world
sees
something
peter
thought
he
knew
better
for
he
heard
quite
near
yet
so
softly
that
it
might
have
been
far
away
the
violinlike
whisper
of
one
who
whistled
beneath
her
breath
was
peter
like
that
and
there
were
times
when
he
was
allowed
to
slip
his
finger
between
those
of
the
tiny
fisted
hand
when
he
felt
their
pressure
they
seemed
to
say
yours
take
care
of
me
wo
you
he
was
sure
she
knew
that
he
had
seen
god
make
her
he
did
not
want
to
speak
he
was
perfectly
content
to
sit
in
the
sheltered
quiet
watching
he
would
listen
outside
the
door
for
hours
on
the
chance
of
being
admitted
if
grace
missed
him
she
always
knew
where
he
might
be
found
as
the
little
sister
grew
he
was
permitted
to
see
her
bathed
and
dressed
one
by
one
the
soft
wrappings
were
removed
and
folded
and
the
perfect
little
body
revealed
itself
no
wonder
god
had
taken
so
long
he
had
put
such
love
into
his
work
by
and
by
she
learnt
how
to
crow
and
splash
her
first
recorded
smile
was
given
to
peter
but
long
before
that
a
name
had
to
be
chosen
she
was
christened
kathleen
nancy
and
was
called
kay
because
that
made
her
sound
dearer
peter
was
nearly
seven
at
the
time
of
her
coming
of
all
people
he
and
his
mother
seemed
to
know
her
best
they
had
secrets
about
her
before
she
could
talk
they
told
one
another
what
her
baby
language
meant
during
her
first
summer
on
earth
they
would
sit
beside
her
cradle
in
the
garden
believing
that
birds
and
flowers
stooped
to
watch
her
no
older
than
peter
his
father
had
said
but
when
he
came
home
from
the
city
he
would
join
them
and
seemed
perfectly
happy
to
gaze
on
kay
with
peter
on
his
knee
holding
nan
free
hand
even
in
those
early
days
it
was
strange
the
power
that
peter
had
over
her
if
she
were
crying
she
would
stop
and
laugh
for
peter
she
would
sleep
for
peter
if
he
hummed
and
rocked
her
when
she
began
to
speak
it
was
peter
who
taught
her
and
interpreted
what
she
said
that
was
during
her
second
summer
when
leaves
in
the
garden
were
tapping
they
grew
to
trust
peter
where
kay
was
concerned
so
gentle
with
her
they
said
be
father
the
care
takes
of
it
uncanny
grace
told
her
sweetheart
her
sweetheart
was
a
policeman
at
this
moment
his
profession
did
not
make
for
sentiment
by
gum
fat
lot
o
care
your
father
took
you
i
grace
father
was
a
cabby
and
was
known
to
the
barrington
household
as
grace
a
name
of
peter
bestowing
he
drove
a
and
had
a
red
face
his
stand
was
at
the
bottom
of
topbury
crescent
which
formed
the
blade
to
the
sickle
of
which
the
terrace
was
the
handle
when
kay
was
beginning
to
toddle
her
cot
was
transferred
from
her
parents
to
peter
bedroom
nan
was
none
too
strong
and
barrington
could
not
afford
to
be
roused
at
five
in
the
morning
he
worked
too
hard
and
required
all
his
rest
had
peter
wishes
been
consulted
this
was
just
how
he
would
have
arranged
matters
from
the
moment
when
the
light
went
out
to
the
moment
when
his
eyelids
reluctantly
lowered
he
had
kay
all
to
himself
throwing
off
the
clothes
he
would
slip
out
and
kneel
beside
her
cot
softying
her
with
his
face
and
hands
he
had
to
do
this
carefully
lest
he
should
be
heard
sometimes
in
stepping
out
the
mattress
squeaked
and
a
voice
would
call
up
the
tall
dim
stairs
are
you
in
bed
an
interval
would
elapse
while
he
hurried
back
then
he
would
answer
truthfully
often
the
voice
would
say
knowingly
are
but
the
temptation
was
too
great
it
was
so
wonderful
to
touch
her
in
the
darkness
to
hear
her
stir
to
feel
her
hand
brush
his
cheek
and
the
warm
sleepy
lips
turned
toward
his
mouth
only
peter
he
would
whisper
and
perhaps
he
would
add
kay
are
you
glad
i
borned
you
oh
yes
it
was
he
who
had
contrived
her
birth
there
as
a
proof
was
the
big
dim
cupboard
where
it
had
all
commenced
in
the
shadowy
darkness
of
the
room
before
grace
came
up
to
undress
he
lived
in
a
world
of
fancy
through
the
oblong
of
the
doorway
the
faint
gold
glimmered
made
by
the
lowered
gas
in
the
square
of
the
window
as
in
a
magic
mirror
all
kinds
of
strange
things
happened
great
soft
clouds
moved
across
it
like
mountains
marching
presently
they
would
stand
aside
giving
him
glimpses
of
deep
lagoons
and
floating
lands
stars
would
dance
out
like
children
holding
hands
and
wink
and
twinkle
at
him
the
moon
would
let
down
her
silver
ladder
smiling
to
him
to
ascend
he
laughed
back
and
shook
his
head
oh
no
thank
you
kay
needed
his
attention
beneath
the
sky
was
a
muffled
world
like
a
whistler
nocturne
of
and
drowsy
murmurs
it
was
a
vague
field
of
seething
shadows
in
which
the
blur
of
was
a
daffodil
forest
dwellings
which
were
blind
all
day
in
streets
he
had
never
traversed
now
peered
stealthily
from
behind
their
curtains
with
the
unblinking
eyes
of
cats
what
did
they
do
down
there
church
bells
in
the
vale
of
holloway
would
try
to
tell
him
sometimes
strains
of
a
would
drift
up
merrily
and
he
would
picture
how
ragged
children
danced
beating
time
with
rapid
feet
upon
the
muddy
pavement
sometimes
in
the
distance
like
a
scarlet
fear
a
train
would
shoot
across
the
murk
and
vanish
but
always
from
these
wanderings
his
imagination
would
return
to
the
cot
where
the
little
sister
nestled
who
was
it
put
the
thought
into
his
head
was
it
some
strange
confusion
between
winking
stars
and
the
bethlehem
story
or
was
it
grace
in
one
of
her
flights
of
poetry
long
ago
he
told
himself
like
this
the
boy
jesus
must
have
sat
keeping
guard
over
a
baby
sister
while
at
the
bottom
of
a
tall
steep
house
mary
helped
joseph
making
chairs
and
tables
once
peter
gave
things
away
completely
by
trusting
too
much
to
his
wakefulness
he
was
found
asleep
on
the
floor
beside
kay
cot
when
grace
came
up
to
undress
if
the
nights
had
their
spice
of
adventure
because
such
doings
were
forbidden
the
mornings
were
not
to
be
sneered
at
he
would
be
wakened
by
a
small
hand
stroking
his
face
and
she
would
snuggle
into
bed
beside
him
years
after
when
he
was
a
man
he
remembered
the
sensation
of
her
cold
feet
when
she
had
found
him
difficult
to
rouse
but
the
greatest
treat
of
all
came
rarely
when
his
father
went
away
on
a
journey
his
mother
could
cast
aside
her
habits
she
would
make
her
home
in
the
nursery
and
hirelings
would
be
driven
out
grace
would
be
given
an
evening
with
her
policeman
and
peter
and
kay
and
nan
would
have
each
other
to
themselves
if
it
were
winter
they
would
have
supper
by
firelight
after
which
they
would
sit
and
toast
themselves
while
nan
told
stories
of
her
girlhood
kay
would
be
taken
into
her
lap
and
peter
would
sit
on
the
rug
cuddling
against
her
skirt
did
daddy
find
you
mummy
and
when
that
had
been
told
in
a
simplified
version
should
i
be
your
little
boy
if
you
married
someone
else
since
there
seemed
some
doubt
peter
made
haste
to
assure
her
i
so
so
in
the
dancing
flames
and
shadows
kay
would
be
undressed
and
popped
into
the
while
peter
helped
then
all
warm
and
snuggly
she
would
be
carried
to
her
mother
bed
in
a
short
time
peter
would
follow
and
fall
asleep
with
his
arms
about
her
toward
midnight
he
would
rouse
the
gas
was
lit
and
someone
was
rustling
looking
down
the
bed
he
would
see
his
mother
with
her
gold
hair
loose
about
her
shoulders
she
would
whisper
placing
her
finger
against
her
mouth
so
he
would
lie
still
watching
her
shadow
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
again
the
room
was
in
darkness
his
face
was
hidden
in
her
breast
as
she
clasped
him
to
her
he
was
thinking
how
lucky
it
was
that
his
father
had
found
her
in
the
morning
kay
would
wake
them
climbing
across
their
legs
or
losing
herself
beneath
the
just
to
be
different
from
all
other
mornings
they
would
have
their
breakfast
before
they
dressed
what
an
adventure
they
made
of
it
and
what
good
times
they
had
in
after
years
looking
back
peter
realized
what
children
he
had
had
for
parents
they
seemed
anything
but
children
then
his
father
was
not
too
old
to
be
a
lion
on
hands
and
knees
beneath
the
table
trying
to
catch
him
as
he
ran
round
at
last
his
mother
would
cry
out
dearest
do
stop
it
you
get
the
boy
and
then
there
were
those
empty
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
house
to
be
furnished
peter
father
led
him
all
over
london
visiting
beery
old
women
and
dingy
old
men
whose
shops
to
the
unpracticed
eye
were
stocked
with
rubbish
oak
paneling
bronzes
french
clocks
canvases
dim
with
dirt
were
discovered
and
carried
home
in
triumph
for
the
canvases
frames
had
to
be
hunted
out
the
pursuit
was
endless
these
treasures
were
driven
home
in
cabs
taking
up
so
much
room
that
peter
had
to
make
himself
smaller
nan
would
fly
to
the
door
as
the
wheels
halted
on
the
terrace
why
did
you
let
him
oh
billy
how
extravagant
my
dear
it
an
investment
i
paid
next
to
nothing
and
sell
it
for
a
thousand
she
corrected
but
as
was
proved
later
she
was
wrong
in
that
when
the
empty
rooms
were
furnished
the
oak
bedroom
and
the
italian
the
modern
furnishings
in
other
parts
of
the
house
were
gradually
supplanted
even
the
staircase
was
hung
with
paintings
which
barrington
restored
himself
there
was
one
little
drawback
to
these
prowlings
through
london
which
peter
was
too
proud
to
mention
his
father
as
he
walked
would
pinch
his
hand
to
show
his
affection
but
it
hurt
he
knew
why
his
father
did
it
so
he
did
not
tell
him
he
bit
his
lips
instead
to
keep
back
the
tears
four
other
people
stole
across
his
childish
horizon
like
wisps
of
cloud
the
misses
jacobite
they
lived
in
an
house
in
topbury
and
kept
no
servants
peter
got
to
know
them
because
they
smiled
at
him
coming
in
and
going
out
of
church
there
was
miss
florence
who
was
tall
and
reserved
and
miss
effie
who
was
little
and
talkative
and
miss
madge
who
was
fat
and
jolly
and
miss
leah
a
who
sat
always
in
a
darkened
room
with
pale
hands
folded
crooning
to
herself
people
said
thing
oh
well
there
no
good
blaming
her
now
she
would
thank
us
for
our
pity
after
all
she
brought
it
on
or
they
said
know
they
were
quite
proud
once
the
belles
of
topbury
two
of
them
were
engaged
to
be
married
their
father
was
alive
then
the
squire
we
called
him
but
after
miss
leah
they
dropped
their
voices
till
they
came
to
the
last
sentence
the
disgrace
of
it
killed
the
old
even
grace
when
she
took
kay
and
peter
to
visit
them
left
them
if
she
could
on
the
doorstep
her
righteous
mood
asserted
itself
she
flounced
her
skirt
in
departing
shaking
off
the
dust
from
her
feet
for
a
testimony
against
them
i
calls
it
if
i
wuz
to
do
like
yer
ma
would
let
me
touch
yer
but
o
course
it
different
i
only
a
and
they
their
so
brazen
i
calls
it
before
i
walked
the
streets
where
a
thing
like
that
in
my
family
i
sink
into
my
grave
fust
that
i
would
i
the
thought
of
their
kissing
yer
my
precious
peter
was
always
wondering
what
it
was
that
miss
leah
had
brought
upon
herself
whatever
it
was
it
stayed
with
her
in
the
room
with
the
lowered
blinds
at
the
back
of
the
house
she
never
went
out
callers
never
saw
her
her
eyes
were
vague
as
though
she
had
wept
away
their
color
she
spoke
in
a
hoarse
whisper
as
in
a
dream
and
her
attention
had
to
be
drawn
to
anything
before
she
saw
it
but
it
was
her
singing
that
shocked
and
thrilled
peter
making
him
both
pitiful
and
frightened
her
song
never
varied
and
never
quite
came
to
an
end
she
repeated
it
over
and
over
you
could
hear
it
in
the
hall
the
moment
you
entered
it
went
on
at
intervals
until
you
left
she
sang
it
with
empty
hands
sitting
without
motion
the
other
side
of
jordan
in
the
sweet
fields
of
eden
where
the
tree
of
life
is
growing
there
is
rest
for
where
were
the
fields
of
peter
liked
the
sound
of
them
and
would
have
asked
her
had
not
something
held
him
back
she
must
be
very
tired
he
thought
to
be
singing
always
about
rest
yet
he
never
saw
her
work
he
had
been
there
many
times
and
had
only
heard
her
until
one
day
as
he
was
scampering
down
the
passage
with
miss
madge
pursuing
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
with
dim
eyes
and
hair
as
white
as
snow
looked
out
she
gazed
at
him
without
interest
but
when
kay
toddled
up
to
her
fearlessly
she
stooped
and
caught
her
to
her
breast
several
things
about
the
misses
jacobite
struck
peter
as
funny
they
divided
the
visit
up
so
that
each
might
have
a
child
for
part
of
it
entirely
to
herself
each
would
behave
during
that
time
as
though
she
were
a
mother
famished
for
affection
returned
from
a
long
journey
and
would
invent
secrets
which
were
to
be
shared
by
nobody
but
the
child
and
herself
kay
and
peter
were
carried
off
into
separate
rooms
and
there
played
with
and
cuddled
by
a
solitary
miss
jacobite
though
the
misses
jacobite
were
obviously
poor
the
children
always
went
home
with
a
present
often
enough
it
was
a
toy
from
the
dusty
disused
nursery
when
they
met
kay
and
peter
on
sundays
and
people
were
watching
they
pretended
to
forget
the
other
things
that
had
happened
wonder
you
let
your
children
go
there
people
said
nan
smiled
slowly
and
answered
softly
gathering
kay
and
peter
to
her
things
they
were
robbed
of
everything
i
have
so
much
i
deserve
i
can
spare
them
a
little
of
my
barrington
that
mere
sentiment
how
does
your
husband
allow
it
one
day
nan
husband
spoke
up
for
himself
you
ever
hear
of
the
raft
i
thought
not
well
nan
and
i
chapter
x
waffles
betters
himself
it
was
the
month
of
june
a
breeze
blowing
in
at
the
open
window
fluttered
out
the
muslin
curtains
and
shook
loose
the
petals
of
roses
standing
on
the
table
a
rattled
down
the
terrace
clattering
its
cans
sounds
which
drifted
in
from
the
world
were
all
what
peter
would
have
described
as
the
walls
of
the
room
were
splashed
with
great
streaks
of
sunlight
which
lit
up
some
of
the
pictures
with
peculiar
intensity
and
left
others
in
contrasting
shadow
one
of
those
which
were
thus
illumined
was
a
dutch
landscape
by
cuyp
hanging
against
the
dark
oak
paneling
above
a
blue
couch
it
represented
a
comfortable
burgher
strolling
in
conversation
with
two
women
on
the
banks
of
a
canal
barrington
liked
to
face
it
while
he
sat
at
breakfast
it
gave
him
a
certain
indifference
to
worry
before
the
rush
of
the
day
commenced
but
this
morning
to
judge
by
his
puckered
forehead
it
had
not
produced
its
usual
effect
he
glanced
up
from
the
letter
he
was
reading
and
tossed
it
across
to
nan
make
of
that
she
bent
over
it
wrinkling
her
brows
the
letter
was
in
a
handwriting
and
the
postscript
which
was
of
nearly
equal
length
was
in
a
woman
do
know
if
it
was
from
anyone
but
ocky
ocky
a
fool
he
always
been
a
fool
and
he
growing
worse
but
jehane
ought
to
have
sounder
sense
it
beyond
me
why
she
married
him
i
never
did
understand
jehane
i
suppose
i
never
not
a
woman
billy
or
else
you
would
she
was
sick
and
tired
of
being
lonely
and
dependent
she
wanted
someone
to
take
care
of
her
ocky
was
the
only
man
who
offered
but
that
eight
years
ago
i
afraid
she
found
him
out
and
she
doing
her
best
to
persuade
herself
that
she
has
poor
jehane
she
always
admired
strong
men
men
she
could
explains
but
it
does
excuse
her
she
had
a
strong
man
in
captain
spashett
the
hurry
of
her
second
marriage
was
indecent
i
never
did
approve
of
it
i
said
nothing
at
first
because
i
thought
she
might
help
ocky
to
grow
a
and
now
there
this
new
folly
which
she
appears
to
dear
is
it
so
foolish
perhaps
she
given
him
a
backbone
and
that
why
he
done
she
laughed
nervously
both
say
that
this
is
a
great
opportunity
for
him
to
better
the
only
way
for
ocky
to
better
himself
is
to
change
his
character
he
a
balloon
a
he
go
up
in
the
air
and
burst
the
higher
he
goes
the
further
he
have
to
tumble
you
think
harsh
with
him
i
know
him
jehane
done
him
no
good
she
despises
him
i
sure
though
she
does
think
she
shows
it
she
filled
his
head
with
stupid
ambitions
and
before
she
done
she
land
him
in
a
mess
she
driven
him
to
this
bravado
with
private
naggings
he
wants
to
prove
to
her
that
he
really
is
a
man
man
he
a
child
in
her
hands
it
hurts
me
to
watch
them
together
why
ca
she
be
a
wife
to
him
and
make
up
her
mind
that
she
married
a
donkey
difficult
for
a
woman
to
make
up
her
mind
to
that
especially
a
proud
impatient
he
paid
no
attention
to
his
wife
interruption
but
went
on
irritably
with
what
he
was
saying
he
giving
up
a
secure
job
and
he
going
into
this
plan
for
buying
up
the
sands
of
sandport
for
nothing
and
selling
them
as
for
a
fortune
even
if
there
were
anything
in
it
going
to
finance
him
of
course
he
come
to
me
as
he
says
he
got
the
just
it
from
where
his
pocket
always
had
a
hole
in
it
when
he
says
he
got
money
i
do
believe
him
when
he
proved
his
word
i
grow
barrington
leant
across
the
table
rapping
with
his
knuckles
the
kind
of
amiable
weak
fellow
who
can
easily
be
made
bad
especially
by
a
woman
who
refuses
to
love
him
once
a
man
like
that
gone
under
you
can
never
bring
him
back
he
lost
what
staying
quality
he
ever
nan
rarely
argued
with
her
husband
pushing
back
her
chair
she
went
and
knelt
beside
him
pressing
her
soft
cheek
against
his
hand
are
a
silly
billy
dearest
to
be
so
serious
on
such
a
happy
morning
no
danger
of
ocky
ever
becoming
bad
and
in
any
case
what
this
got
to
do
with
the
matter
i
know
he
foolish
and
his
jokes
get
on
your
nerves
but
it
is
his
fault
that
he
not
clever
like
you
you
should
be
gloomy
just
because
he
going
to
be
daring
i
do
wonder
he
sick
of
that
lawyer
office
and
it
absurd
to
think
that
going
to
be
bad
look
how
peter
loves
him
you
like
ocky
more
than
you
pretend
now
do
you
liking
being
sorry
i
always
sorry
for
an
ass
and
i
angry
with
jehane
because
she
knows
better
she
doing
this
because
jealous
of
you
that
why
she
clutches
at
this
bubble
chance
of
you
a
little
unjust
to
her
billy
since
our
marriage
always
been
unjust
to
her
you
know
why
she
jealous
she
wants
her
husband
to
be
like
her
voice
sank
away
to
a
whisper
janey
i
did
i
did
play
fair
she
had
said
that
night
at
cassingland
in
her
violent
assertion
of
fairness
there
had
been
an
implied
question
which
jehane
had
never
answered
both
she
and
her
husband
knew
that
they
had
never
been
acquitted
barrington
drew
nan
head
against
his
shoulder
then
he
kissed
her
with
new
and
eager
gladness
it
is
only
pity
you
feel
for
ocky
she
persisted
he
pulled
out
his
watch
hastily
and
having
replaced
it
gulped
down
his
coffee
i
was
peter
age
we
were
brought
up
like
brothers
together
i
loved
him
then
i
disappointed
in
him
now
and
yet
always
catching
glimpses
in
him
of
the
little
chap
i
played
with
you
see
at
school
i
was
the
stronger
and
had
to
protect
him
i
was
always
fighting
his
battles
and
one
whole
term
when
his
hand
was
poisoned
i
had
to
take
him
to
the
doctor
to
get
it
dressed
no
it
is
only
pity
pepperminta
it
as
he
was
going
out
of
the
door
she
called
after
him
i
suppose
i
can
write
and
say
we
have
them
they
moving
the
children
does
say
how
means
all
i
expect
there
the
garden
for
them
it
be
fun
for
kay
and
a
week
later
jehane
traveled
across
london
to
terrace
bringing
with
her
glory
aged
nine
riska
aged
six
and
her
youngest
child
eustace
who
was
the
same
age
as
kathleen
jehane
was
now
in
her
year
a
striking
brooding
type
of
woman
as
her
face
had
grown
thinner
and
her
cheeks
had
lost
their
color
the
gipsy
blackness
of
her
appearance
had
become
more
noticeable
she
still
had
a
fine
figure
so
that
men
in
public
conveyances
would
furtively
lower
their
papers
to
gaze
at
her
there
clung
about
her
an
atmosphere
of
adventure
of
which
she
was
not
entirely
unaware
she
was
unconquerably
romantic
and
would
spin
herself
stories
in
the
silence
of
her
fancy
of
a
love
that
was
crushing
in
its
intensity
no
one
would
have
guessed
from
the
hard
little
lines
about
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
mouth
that
this
imaginative
tenderness
formed
part
of
her
character
since
the
birth
of
eustace
her
hair
had
fallen
out
in
handfuls
and
she
had
adopted
a
style
of
dressing
it
that
was
distinctly
unbecoming
she
had
had
her
combings
made
up
into
an
affair
which
glory
called
it
consisted
of
curls
sewn
together
in
rows
like
sausages
which
she
pinned
across
the
top
of
her
head
so
that
they
made
a
fringe
along
her
forehead
it
gave
her
an
look
of
prim
severity
jehane
retained
for
nan
an
affection
which
was
partly
genuine
and
partly
habit
but
she
resented
nan
youthful
appearance
with
slow
jealous
anger
attributing
it
to
freedom
from
anxiety
and
the
possession
of
money
as
for
nan
her
attitude
was
one
of
gentle
and
atoning
apology
for
her
happiness
so
glad
you
brought
the
children
yourself
who
could
have
brought
them
i
not
like
you
i
only
keep
two
servants
when
this
scheme
of
ocky
has
turned
out
all
right
perhaps
it
may
be
she
turned
swiftly
on
nan
with
latent
defiance
as
though
challenging
her
to
express
doubt
sure
both
billy
and
i
hope
it
will
would
it
be
splendid
to
see
ocky
really
a
big
man
would
be
a
good
deal
more
than
splendid
it
would
mean
the
end
of
little
houses
and
cheap
servants
and
neighbors
that
you
ca
introduce
to
your
father
friends
it
would
mean
the
end
of
pinching
and
scraping
to
save
a
penny
and
it
would
mean
a
chance
for
my
nan
slipped
an
arm
into
hers
and
hugged
it
old
thing
i
think
i
understand
and
when
is
ocky
coming
over
to
tell
us
all
about
it
he
gave
us
hardly
any
details
in
his
jehane
became
evasive
naturally
very
busy
the
chance
developed
so
suddenly
that
he
hardly
had
time
to
turn
round
it
came
to
him
through
a
client
at
the
office
playfair
had
noticed
him
at
his
desk
as
he
passed
in
and
out
to
see
wagstaff
he
told
ocky
since
that
he
spotted
him
at
once
and
said
to
himself
ever
i
want
a
chap
push
and
legal
knowledge
that
my
man
he
never
talked
with
him
not
much
more
than
to
say
do
or
it
wonderful
that
he
should
have
sized
him
up
in
a
flash
jehane
glanced
at
her
narrowly
may
be
wonderful
to
it
to
i
well
aware
that
you
and
billy
do
think
much
of
ocky
oh
where
the
sense
in
disowning
it
you
both
think
he
a
born
sure
you
never
heard
billy
say
him
say
it
of
course
i
did
i
like
to
hear
him
dare
to
say
anything
like
that
about
my
husband
but
actions
speak
louder
than
words
he
thinks
it
just
the
same
he
thinks
that
ocky
good
for
nothing
but
to
sit
at
a
desk
taking
a
salary
from
another
man
you
did
know
that
for
years
ocky
been
the
brains
of
that
office
nan
lifted
her
honest
eyes
she
was
filled
with
discomfort
this
kind
of
controversy
was
always
happening
when
they
met
they
drifted
into
some
sort
of
feud
for
which
jehane
invariably
held
her
responsible
brains
of
the
office
no
indeed
i
never
heard
that
why
did
you
tell
us
you
and
billy
thought
he
was
incompetent
and
it
did
seem
worth
the
trouble
to
correct
sure
i
always
thought
him
very
kind
especially
to
what
kindness
got
to
do
with
being
clever
nan
pressed
jehane
to
stay
to
dinner
she
would
send
a
telegram
to
ocky
she
would
send
her
home
in
a
cab
but
jehane
was
in
an
ungracious
mood
and
eager
to
take
offense
she
resented
the
implication
that
a
cab
was
a
luxury
no
she
could
stay
there
was
too
much
to
do
she
had
intended
to
return
in
a
cab
anyhow
in
reality
she
was
anxious
to
avoid
barrington
shrewd
questioning
she
was
rising
to
take
her
departure
when
she
saw
him
descending
the
garden
steps
jehane
this
is
luck
i
had
thoughts
of
you
all
day
that
letter
got
on
my
nerves
i
could
work
so
i
came
home
oh
no
we
not
going
to
let
you
off
now
you
got
to
stop
and
tell
us
by
the
way
before
ocky
actually
decides
i
like
to
talk
the
whole
matter
over
with
decided
do
mean
why
not
he
given
wagstaff
notice
things
so
happened
that
he
had
to
make
up
his
mind
in
a
hurry
or
lose
but
i
really
ought
to
be
going
nan
knows
everything
barrington
placed
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
arrestingly
at
his
touch
she
drew
back
and
colored
thing
too
serious
jehane
he
said
be
dismissed
in
a
sentence
i
have
a
right
to
he
spoke
kindly
but
she
answered
him
hotly
right
pray
if
anything
goes
wrong
there
only
me
to
fall
back
on
and
then
there
the
right
of
ca
say
you
shown
yourself
over
friendly
if
you
had
to
meet
ocky
you
let
all
the
world
see
you
were
irritated
if
you
ever
invited
him
to
your
house
you
taken
very
good
care
that
no
one
important
was
present
one
would
judge
that
you
thought
he
lowered
you
i
ca
see
that
you
have
the
right
to
know
can
only
be
because
your
husband
has
told
you
to
quote
one
instance
it
was
through
my
influence
that
he
got
this
position
that
he
now
thrown
over
wagstaff
is
my
jehane
tossed
her
head
always
want
to
make
out
that
he
owes
you
everything
well
what
is
it
that
i
forced
to
tell
you
barrington
kept
silence
while
they
walked
down
the
path
to
where
chairs
were
spread
beneath
the
cedar
the
children
ran
up
boisterously
to
greet
him
having
kissed
them
he
told
grace
to
take
them
away
and
to
keep
them
quiet
when
he
spoke
his
tones
were
grave
and
measured
fair
of
ocky
to
send
you
to
tell
us
he
ought
to
have
come
did
send
barrington
held
up
his
hand
ca
tell
me
anything
on
that
score
from
the
first
he
shirked
responsibility
he
would
never
fight
if
he
could
get
anyone
else
to
fight
for
him
many
and
many
the
time
had
to
dohis
dirty
work
now
you
doing
it
this
is
unpleasant
hearing
jehane
but
you
know
it
true
i
take
a
wager
that
you
spent
hours
trying
to
screw
up
his
courage
to
make
him
come
she
lifted
her
head
to
deny
it
but
his
quiet
gray
eyes
met
hers
their
sympathy
and
justice
disturbed
her
she
refused
to
be
pitied
by
this
man
a
great
fear
rose
in
her
throat
what
if
his
opinion
of
her
husband
were
correct
it
was
the
opinion
she
herself
had
had
for
years
and
had
tried
to
stifle
time
and
again
she
had
listened
to
his
plausibility
his
boastings
that
he
was
the
brains
of
the
office
that
luck
was
against
him
and
that
one
day
he
would
show
the
world
she
had
used
his
arguments
to
defend
him
to
her
relations
and
friends
in
public
she
had
made
a
parade
of
being
proud
of
him
in
private
she
had
tried
to
ridicule
him
out
of
his
manners
and
now
she
was
trying
so
hard
to
believe
that
he
had
found
his
it
was
cruel
of
barrington
especially
cruel
when
he
knew
quite
well
that
it
was
him
she
had
loved
she
could
not
endure
to
sit
still
and
hear
him
voice
her
own
suspicious
and
calmly
analyze
the
folly
of
her
marriage
you
think
that
my
husband
was
afraid
to
come
and
tell
you
the
only
way
to
prove
the
contrary
is
to
let
him
come
himself
shall
be
more
than
glad
to
see
but
ocky
did
not
come
nor
the
next
day
the
day
after
that
barrington
went
to
see
his
lawyer
wagstaff
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
about
my
cousin
wagstaff
twitched
his
trousers
up
to
prevent
them
from
rucking
as
he
crossed
his
legs
there
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
barrington
understand
he
given
you
wagstaff
sat
up
suddenly
what
he
told
you
that
he
did
not
tell
me
his
wife
his
wife
he
left
her
to
make
the
explanations
just
what
one
might
he
did
give
you
notice
wagstaff
spoke
testily
as
though
for
an
employee
to
give
him
notice
was
an
event
beyond
the
bounds
of
possibility
he
left
without
notifying
you
the
lawyer
noticed
that
the
door
leading
into
the
main
office
was
ajar
he
got
up
and
closed
it
when
he
returned
he
did
not
himself
but
straddled
the
holding
up
his
although
no
fire
was
burning
barrington
sir
i
put
up
with
your
cousin
shiftlessness
for
longer
that
i
ought
to
have
done
i
did
it
out
of
respect
for
you
sir
there
was
a
time
when
i
hoped
i
might
make
something
of
him
he
can
be
over
trifles
and
his
own
affairs
but
he
never
put
any
interest
into
my
work
he
was
insubordinate
not
to
my
face
you
understand
but
when
my
back
was
turned
he
was
a
good
influence
in
the
office
i
tell
you
this
sir
to
prove
that
i
have
acted
without
the
lawyer
waggled
his
and
seemed
to
find
a
blemish
in
his
boots
so
earnestly
did
he
regard
them
when
he
received
no
help
from
barrington
he
suddenly
came
to
the
point
and
looked
up
sharply
betrayed
professional
confidence
so
i
sacked
it
happened
before
he
was
always
garrulous
this
time
it
was
an
affair
of
some
property
at
sandport
our
client
had
two
competing
purchasers
one
of
whom
was
a
playfair
your
cousin
leaked
to
playfair
kept
him
informed
as
to
what
the
other
purchaser
was
doing
not
a
nice
thing
to
occur
this
last
remark
was
as
much
an
interrogation
as
an
assertion
the
lawyer
waited
for
his
opinion
to
be
indorsed
at
all
nice
barrington
assented
it
lost
you
any
money
i
must
refund
a
question
of
money
would
hear
of
as
wagstaff
shook
hands
at
parting
he
offered
a
crumb
of
comfort
i
say
your
cousin
is
dishonest
barrington
that
would
be
strong
perhaps
it
would
be
better
stated
by
saying
that
his
sense
of
honor
is
said
barrington
brusquely
think
i
catch
your
chapter
xi
the
home
life
of
a
financier
people
who
loved
ocky
waffles
always
loved
him
for
his
good
he
would
have
preferred
to
have
been
loved
for
almost
any
other
purpose
affection
in
his
experience
turned
friends
into
schoolmasters
there
was
barrington
a
fine
chap
and
all
that
but
why
the
dickens
did
he
take
such
endless
pains
to
be
so
uselessly
unpleasant
ocky
was
on
the
lookout
for
jehane
when
she
returned
from
topbury
as
she
turned
the
corner
he
espied
her
from
behind
the
curtains
and
lit
his
pipe
to
give
himself
confidence
no
sooner
had
she
entered
than
she
commenced
an
account
of
her
visit
indignantly
underlining
her
interview
with
barrington
ocky
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
table
puffing
away
and
swinging
his
legs
to
see
me
does
he
he
can
go
on
wanting
i
sick
of
his
interfering
a
fat
lot
he
ever
done
to
help
me
and
with
his
position
and
friends
he
could
have
helped
me
instead
of
that
he
gives
me
his
advice
truth
is
jehane
he
does
want
to
see
us
climb
he
rather
be
the
patron
of
the
family
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
out
to
put
a
spoke
in
my
wheel
oh
i
know
him
if
he
so
anxious
for
information
he
can
come
here
to
get
while
he
spoke
he
scrutinized
his
wife
judging
the
effect
of
his
blustering
independence
she
was
suspicious
of
some
hidden
knowledge
he
felt
it
something
had
been
said
behind
his
back
at
topbury
something
derogatory
could
barrington
have
heard
already
pressing
down
the
ashes
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
he
struck
a
match
jehane
was
between
himself
and
the
door
he
wondered
whether
he
could
slip
past
her
and
make
his
exit
if
things
became
unpleasant
he
detested
being
cornered
he
could
be
so
much
braver
when
the
means
of
escape
lay
behind
him
meanwhile
it
seemed
good
policy
to
continue
talking
do
like
the
way
they
treat
you
at
topbury
you
always
come
home
there
too
much
condescension
nan
overdoes
it
when
she
tries
to
be
kind
the
rich
relation
attitude
it
riles
me
when
she
makes
you
a
present
it
always
a
dress
might
just
as
well
tell
you
to
your
face
that
you
shabby
and
last
christmas
sending
clothes
to
eustace
thank
god
we
not
paupers
and
never
shall
be
as
he
worked
himself
into
a
passion
jehane
eyed
him
somberly
the
everlasting
pipe
dangling
from
his
mouth
annoyed
her
immensely
his
trousers
bagging
at
the
knees
and
his
pockets
stuffed
with
rubbish
were
perpetual
eyesores
she
hated
his
slack
appearance
other
men
with
his
income
at
least
attained
neatness
it
was
not
that
he
spared
money
on
his
clothes
she
caught
herself
comparing
him
with
barrington
barrington
whose
tidy
body
was
the
outward
sign
of
his
mind
her
husband
went
on
talking
and
her
irritation
took
a
new
direction
bet
a
fiver
what
they
said
when
you
told
dearest
if
it
only
happen
that
nan
yes
humph
sand
at
sandport
we
must
talk
this
over
before
he
decides
that
barrington
we
can
guess
what
his
advice
amount
to
ca
we
old
duchess
it
was
safe
to
venture
the
endearment
now
if
they
had
nothing
else
in
common
they
were
partners
in
their
animosities
when
running
down
an
enemy
together
he
could
dare
to
express
his
affection
for
her
his
way
of
doing
this
was
to
call
her
at
other
times
she
would
brush
him
aside
with
be
silly
she
often
called
him
treating
any
demonstration
as
tawdry
sentimentality
she
had
no
idea
how
deeply
it
wounded
now
as
she
sank
into
the
chair
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
awkwardly
old
gel
they
tired
you
out
had
nothing
to
eat
since
you
left
here
i
warrant
put
up
your
tootsies
and
i
pull
off
your
shoes
then
i
order
some
supper
for
could
eat
the
room
was
in
darkness
and
the
window
wide
in
the
street
children
were
screaming
and
playing
a
mother
standing
on
her
doorstep
called
to
her
truants
through
the
dusk
oh
for
a
gust
of
silence
a
desert
of
sound
without
footsteps
jehane
felt
that
her
life
was
trespassed
on
jostled
undignified
through
the
cramped
suburb
of
villas
crept
the
summer
night
like
a
shameful
woman
footsore
and
clad
in
lavender
villas
they
were
so
similar
that
if
you
shook
them
up
in
a
gigantic
hat
and
set
them
out
afresh
the
streets
would
look
in
no
way
different
they
were
all
built
in
the
same
style
the
mortar
had
fallen
out
in
the
same
places
the
front
gardens
were
of
equal
dimensions
they
had
no
individuality
if
anyone
attempted
to
be
original
in
the
color
of
her
paint
or
the
shape
of
her
curtains
next
day
she
was
copied
with
the
stale
odor
of
tobacco
mingled
the
sweet
fragrance
of
june
flowers
she
had
only
to
close
her
eyes
and
she
was
back
in
oxford
oxford
which
she
had
exchanged
for
this
rash
experiment
she
wondered
had
she
been
more
patient
would
something
more
delightful
have
happened
the
sameness
of
economy
had
worn
out
her
strength
and
its
prospect
appalled
if
ocky
could
contrive
her
escape
even
at
this
late
hour
what
right
had
barrington
to
prevent
him
he
had
gone
to
fetch
her
slippers
that
at
least
was
kind
and
thoughtful
she
treated
him
with
spite
she
shrank
from
the
familiarity
of
his
touch
she
hated
herself
for
it
and
yet
she
eked
out
the
seconds
of
her
respite
from
him
a
shuffled
by
the
garden
railings
at
his
magic
primrose
pools
weltered
up
in
the
this
business
of
marriage
had
she
been
less
hasty
she
might
have
done
better
for
herself
oh
well
the
wisdom
which
follows
the
event
footsteps
on
the
stairs
as
he
knelt
to
put
on
her
slippers
she
conquered
her
revulsion
and
let
her
hand
rest
on
his
head
he
started
surprised
it
was
long
since
she
had
shown
him
affection
his
voice
was
shaky
when
he
addressed
her
you
better
old
dear
more
rested
are
you
she
held
him
at
arm
length
her
palms
flat
against
his
breast
in
the
darkness
she
felt
the
pleading
in
his
eyes
ocky

do
it
this
time

what
duchess
call
me

for
once

what
i

this
time
wo

so
was
talking
to
playfair
only
this
morning
and
he
but
look
here
what
makes
you
ask
that
take
all
the
stuffing
out
of
me
if
begin
to
doubt
who
been
saying
anything
is
what
they
he
lit
his
pipe
and
crossed
over
to
the
window
in
the
darkness
his
outlined
figure
looked
strangely
and
ineffectual
her
heart
sank
and
her
hope
became
desperate
his
voice
reached
her
blustering
and
muffled
she
did
wish
he
would
remove
his
pipe
when
he
spoke
to
her
know
i
know
confound
him
he
been
throwing
cold
water
on
my
plans
as
usual
wants
to
see

does
he
well
if
he
wants
badly
enough
to
cross
london
ocky
waffles
is
his
man
i
sha
go
to
him
jehane
strove
to
believe
that
his
opposition
to
barrington
was
a
token
of
new
strength
four
days
later
a
note
arrived
she
was
tempted
to
open
it
but
it
was
addressed
to
her
husband
directly
he
came
in
she
placed
it
in
his
hands
it
aloud
what
does
he
say
she
watched
ocky
face
and
saw
how
it
faltered
then
he
hid
the
expression
behind
a
mask
of
cynicism
you
wo
read
it
to
me
let
me
read
it
he
crumpled
it
into
his
pocket
hurriedly
as
though
he
feared
that
she
would
snatch
it
from
him
when
all
was
safe
he
turned
toward
the
hunting
for
a
match
did
you
do
that
was
addressed
to
me
was
it
barrington
do
let
his
wife
read
his
letters
i
bet
neither
do
i
i
not
a
lawyer
clerk
in
an
office
any
longer
i
going
to
be
a
big
what
did
he
say
forced
to
answer
ocky
became
reproachful
you
suspecting
me
again
you
remember
what
you
promised
the
other
night
he
says
he
wants
to
see
me
thinks
there
may
be
something
in
my
plan
daresay
he
offer
to
put
money
into
it
you
may
bet
this
little
boy
wo
let
him
of
course
on
the
surface
he
advises
that
all
why
ca
you
let
me
read
his
letter
if
i
did
i
be
acting
as
though
you
did
trust
me
you
could
have
read
it
with
pleasure
if
you
had
made
such
a
jehane
knew
his
weak
obstinacy
of
old
and
gave
up
the
contest
wo
see
him
of
course
unless
he
comes
to
the
know
about
you
were
so
can
change
my
mind
ca
i
his
letter
puts
a
different
complexion
on
ocky
barrington
is
he
does
say
one
thing
to
me
and
another
thing
to
you
he
may
be
awkward
but
he
is
underhand
if
he
in
favor
of
your
schemes
now
he
must
have
heard
something
changed
a
doubt
of
it
very
soon
a
good
many
people
who
thought
me
small
beer
hear
you
not
answered
my
question
where
are
you
going
to
see
him
maybe
at
his
whistling
with
feigned
cheerfulness
he
strolled
out
as
she
watched
him
slouch
down
the
road
her
fingers
itched
to
correct
the
angle
of
his
hat
that
night
she
searched
his
pockets
and
found
the
letter
it
read
wagstaff
has
told
me
the
truth
you
must
meet
me
at
my
place
of
business
at
twelve
it
was
capable
of
the
construction
her
husband
had
put
on
it
it
was
capable
of
many
others
feeling
through
the
coat
next
morning
searching
for
his
ocky
was
shrewd
enough
to
notice
that
the
letter
was
in
its
envelope
such
neatness
was
not
his
habit
when
he
came
back
in
the
evening
from
seeing
barrington
and
jehane
enquired
what
he
had
been
doing
he
handed
her
the
letter
with
generous
frankness
can
read
it
now
i
wanted
to
be
sure
before
i
told
you
i
was
right
barrington
been
talking
to
wagstaif
and
has
heard
all
about
it
oh
yes
i
can
tell
you
he
a
very
different
discovered
that
ocky
waffles
esquire
is
a
person
to
be
she
scorned
herself
for
her
mean
suspicions
he
deserved
an
atonement
darling
i
so
as
her
arms
went
about
him
he
patted
her
on
the
back
all
right
old
duchess
you
believe
in
me
now
eh
she
lifted
her
face
from
his
shoulder
it
was
with
penitence
knows
i
always
tried
to
he
must
go
her
one
better
in
generosity
having
deceived
her
he
could
afford
to
be
magnanimous
succeeded
old
dear
you
given
me
your
strength
and
made
a
man
of
me
i
your
chapter
xii
the
child
the
bettering
of
waffles
marked
the
beginning
of
that
intimate
and
freakish
association
which
was
to
shape
the
careers
of
the
children
of
both
families
though
their
relationship
was
distant
and
in
the
case
of
glory
they
had
been
taught
to
regard
one
another
as
cousins
as
yet
they
had
met
so
occasionally
and
so
briefly
that
they
had
not
worn
off
the
distrust
which
is
the
common
attitude
of
children
toward
strangers
from
now
on
they
were
to
enter
increasingly
into
one
another
lives
though
barrington
had
said
that
it
would
be
fun
for
kay
and
peter
to
have
jehane
children
to
play
with
in
the
garden
and
nan
had
assented
neither
of
them
had
undertaken
to
tell
kay
and
peter
they
had
promised
them
a
surprise
that
was
all
truth
to
tell
they
had
their
doubts
about
peter
and
how
he
would
receive
their
information
his
jealous
air
of
proprietorship
regarding
his
little
sister
gave
them
moments
of
puzzled
uneasiness
years
ago
before
kay
was
born
the
doctor
had
told
them
an
imaginative
child
oh
dear
no
he
quite
well
he
grow
out
of
but
he
had
he
stood
by
her
always
as
if
he
were
a
wall
between
her
and
some
threatened
danger
he
was
not
happy
away
from
her
his
life
seemed
locked
up
in
her
life
his
tenderness
for
her
was
beyond
his
years
beautiful
and
mysterious
in
the
midst
of
his
play
he
would
still
raise
his
head
suddenly
listening
and
expectant
he
was
odd
and
gentle
in
many
ways
to
his
mother
his
oddness
was
both
frightening
and
endearing
cookie
shook
her
head
over
him
and
sighed
far
away
from
this
old
world
i
doubt
never
grow
up
to
and
grace
would
reply
sharply
rot
but
she
would
wipe
her
eye
he
had
a
habit
of
asking
questions
before
guests
with
startling
directness
asking
them
with
big
innocent
eyes
they
were
questions
for
which
his
mother
felt
bound
to
apologize
so
imaginative
for
many
years
he
was
our
only
peter
wondering
wherein
he
had
done
wrong
would
sidle
up
to
her
when
the
guests
were
gone
inquiring
what
is
a
child
his
father
when
he
heard
him
would
laugh
peter
do
be
peterish
or
you
make
us
all
so
they
did
not
tell
him
when
his
cousins
were
expected
he
was
in
the
garden
on
the
grass
beneath
the
cedar
with
kay
curled
against
him
he
was
telling
her
stories
his
own
inventions
on
the
wall
partly
hidden
in
creepers
basking
in
the
sunshine
blinking
down
on
them
through
slits
of
eyes
was
a
great
gray
tabby
the
tabby
was
the
subject
of
the
story
one
day
returning
along
the
terrace
he
had
found
her
her
bones
were
poking
through
her
fur
she
was
evidently
a
stray
he
had
stopped
to
stroke
her
and
she
had
followed
after
being
fed
on
the
doorstep
she
refused
to
set
off
on
her
wanderings
again
whenever
the
door
opened
she
entered
like
a
streak
of
lightning
she
was
determined
to
be
adopted
though
cook
had
broomed
her
on
to
the
pavement
many
times
she
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
by
any
harshness
of
refusal
it
was
almost
as
though
she
knew
that
kay
and
peter
were
her
eager
advocates
with
a
cat
so
determined
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
take
her
out
and
lose
her
so
she
was
captured
by
feigned
kindness
and
tied
in
a
grace
was
given
a
shilling
and
the
with
instructions
to
go
on
a
trip
to
hampstead
and
to
leave
the
behind
now
whether
it
was
that
grace
was
more
than
her
statements
or
whether
it
was
that
she
preferred
the
company
of
her
policeman
to
the
fulfilling
of
her
errand
the
fact
remains
that
the
cat
got
back
before
her
an
incredible
performance
if
the
basket
had
really
been
left
at
hampstead
grace
was
circumstantial
in
the
account
she
gave
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
accept
her
word
that
a
cat
had
traveled
more
swiftly
than
a
train
stern
methods
were
employed
doors
were
closed
against
the
cat
things
were
thrown
at
it
it
was
encouraged
to
go
hungry
the
children
were
forbidden
to
call
it
one
morning
peter
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
window
attracted
by
a
strange
noise
looking
down
into
the
garden
he
saw
a
flurry
of
fur
careering
across
flowerbeds
till
it
was
brought
up
sharply
against
the
wall
with
a
bang
the
bang
was
caused
by
a
in
which
the
cat
had
got
its
head
fastened
while
foraging
in
a
before
he
could
go
to
its
rescue
cook
came
out
with
her
hostile
broom
and
commenced
the
chase
the
cat
blinded
and
maddened
by
a
miracle
of
agility
climbed
a
tree
leapt
into
a
neighboring
garden
and
vanished
a
week
later
it
returned
with
a
ring
about
its
neck
where
the
jagged
edges
of
the
tin
had
torn
it
such
persistence
and
loyalty
of
affection
were
not
to
be
thwarted
at
first
the
animal
was
tolerated
then
as
its
manners
and
appearance
improved
it
was
taken
into
the
family
because
of
its
adventures
when
a
name
had
to
be
chosen
peter
father
suggested
romance
when
romance
gave
birth
to
kittens
they
were
named
after
various
of
the
novelists
the
history
of
romance
where
she
went
and
what
she
did
was
a
story
which
kay
was
never
tired
of
hearing
nor
peter
of
telling
blinking
down
from
the
wall
on
this
sunshiny
morning
romance
listened
with
contented
pride
to
the
children
much
as
an
old
soldier
might
whose
campaigning
days
were
ended
what
did
putty
say
when
gwacie
twied
to
lost
her
the
child
was
about
to
answer
when
his
mother
came
out
under
the
mulberry
kay
oh
there
you
are
here
your
for
a
day
or
two
while
the
cousins
were
a
novelty
there
was
nothing
but
laughter
and
delight
but
when
peter
understood
that
their
visit
was
of
undetermined
length
he
began
to
regard
their
coming
as
an
intrusion
kay
and
eustace
were
of
the
same
age
and
naturally
chose
one
another
as
playmates
eustace
was
a
fat
dull
boy
prone
to
tears
with
his
mother
black
eyes
and
handsome
hair
and
his
father
coaxing
ways
he
was
only
four
but
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
make
peter
aged
ten
wretched
for
kay
developed
a
will
of
her
own
and
cared
no
more
for
peterish
stories
now
that
she
could
have
eustace
for
her
slave
so
peter
was
left
to
riska
and
glory
his
old
games
for
two
were
useless
he
had
to
think
up
fresh
inventions
in
which
three
might
partake
he
had
no
heart
for
it
grace
came
to
the
rescue
with
pious
hints
from
the
bible
in
the
stable
by
a
disused
tank
they
would
enact
jacob
wooing
of
rachel
the
tank
was
the
well
at
which
jacob
met
her
and
romance
was
the
sheep
brought
down
to
be
watered
she
was
when
they
could
catch
her
but
the
game
nearly
always
ended
in
flushed
cheeks
and
protesting
voices
riska
would
insist
on
being
rachel
leaving
glory
the
undesired
part
of
leah
who
was
sore
of
eye
of
his
two
peter
preferred
glory
riska
was
too
and
stormy
so
when
he
had
served
for
rachel
seven
years
and
instead
had
won
leah
he
not
infrequently
was
content
to
stop
setting
bible
history
at
defiance
one
evening
his
father
walking
beneath
the
heard
voices
in
the
empty
stable
wo
i
wo
in
stubborn
tones
you
shall
you
shall
in
a
passionate
wail
he
opened
the
door
in
the
wall
quietly
glory
was
sitting
on
the
ground
placid
eyed
watching
a
little
boy
who
held
off
a
small
fiercely
determined
to
embrace
him
when
matters
had
been
sullenly
explained
barrington
drew
his
son
to
him
a
lady
asks
you
to
kiss
her
you
should
do
it
it
peterish
not
to
but
polygamy
always
ends
in
a
cry
it
better
not
to
play
at
then
came
the
inevitable
question
is
polgigamy
father
grace
was
asked
for
a
fresh
suggestion
the
result
was
samson
and
delilah
to
peter
way
of
thinking
riska
was
quite
suited
to
the
rôle
of
delilah
too
well
suited
in
revenge
before
he
could
stop
her
she
cut
off
peter
hair
at
the
game
first
playing
during
her
stay
at
topbury
she
committed
many
such
offences
she
was
a
lawless
little
creature
strong
of
character
a
wilful
wisp
of
a
child
and
extraordinarily
like
jehane
her
fragile
eager
face
with
its
coral
mouth
and
soft
dark
eyes
could
change
from
demure
prettiness
to
a
flame
of
anger
the
moment
she
was
thwarted
yet
smiling
or
stormy
her
body
and
long
black
curls
made
her
always
beautiful
a
wild
and
destructive
kind
of
beauty
from
the
first
she
claimed
peter
as
her
sole
possession
and
peter
well
peter
did
his
best
politely
to
avoid
her
glory
was
his
favorite
though
he
often
seemed
to
ignore
her
she
was
the
opposite
to
her
in
both
appearance
and
temper
she
had
nothing
of
jehane
in
her
nor
did
she
resemble
her
soldier
father
she
was
oddly
like
to
kay
and
to
a
man
whom
her
mother
had
desired
with
all
her
heart
it
was
strange
she
was
and
her
hair
was
of
a
primrose
shade
she
was
tall
for
her
age
taller
than
peter
and
carried
herself
with
sweet
and
subdued
quietness
she
said
very
little
and
had
submissive
ways
her
actions
spoke
loudly
for
anyone
she
loved
they
spoke
loudly
for
peter
but
he
scarcely
observed
them
his
eyes
were
all
for
kay
glory
was
like
his
shadow
stealing
after
him
across
the
sunlight
through
that
month
of
june
her
hand
was
always
slipping
shyly
into
his
from
behind
and
she
understood
his
love
for
his
sister
accepting
it
without
question
she
would
go
to
her
small
along
eustace
glory
wants
to
show
you
eustace
wanth
to
play
wiv
can
play
with
kay
directly
just
come
with
glory
there
a
dear
little
she
would
nod
to
peter
knowingly
and
smile
to
him
leading
eustace
away
and
leaving
him
alone
with
kay
he
could
fill
her
eyes
with
tears
at
the
least
show
of
irritation
her
persistent
following
did
irritate
him
sometimes
once
cross
because
she
followed
he
told
her
to
sit
on
the
stable
wall
and
not
to
move
till
he
said
she
might
came
and
there
was
no
glory
they
searched
the
house
for
her
and
went
out
into
the
garden
calling
not
till
peter
called
did
she
answer
then
he
remembered
why
he
remembered
years
after
the
forlornness
of
that
face
it
was
peterish
of
him
to
forget
glory
and
to
remember
her
almost
too
late
nan
sitting
sewing
in
the
quiet
sunlight
would
often
drop
her
work
to
watch
the
children
she
noticed
how
they
kept
together
yet
always
a
little
separate
acting
out
the
clash
of
temperaments
which
they
had
inherited
from
their
parents
and
she
noticed
increasingly
something
else
something
which
she
never
mentioned
and
which
explained
jehane
to
her
that
astonishing
likeness
of
glory
to
kay
as
though
they
had
been
sisters
she
would
call
glory
to
her
and
as
the
child
sat
at
her
feet
would
say
you
like
peter
darling
the
honest
eyes
would
be
lifted
to
her
own
in
affirmation
much
much
the
girlish
hand
would
slip
into
her
own
and
presently
a
faltering
voice
would
whisper
he
does
like
me
always
i
worry
him
nan
would
call
to
peter
tired
of
sitting
with
mother
she
wants
her
little
as
they
wandered
away
across
the
lawn
she
would
follow
them
with
her
eyes
hope
jehane
good
to
her
she
said
to
barrington
to
be
in
her
jealous
a
nice
than
riska
or
eustace
that
thanks
to
captain
yes
nan
would
say
waffles
having
moved
his
belongings
to
sandport
came
to
fetch
the
intruders
peter
watched
them
depart
with
a
sense
of
relief
now
things
would
settle
back
into
their
old
groove
in
july
the
house
at
topbury
was
closed
and
the
barringtons
went
for
their
holiday
to
north
wales
the
servants
were
sent
to
their
homes
with
the
exception
of
grace
summer
holidays
were
ecstatic
times
of
and
old
clothes
when
parents
put
aside
their
busy
manners
broke
rules
and
played
truant
this
particular
holiday
was
made
additionally
adventurous
by
a
tandem
tricycle
on
which
peter
was
allowed
to
accompany
his
father
when
his
mother
was
too
tired
trying
to
catch
the
pedals
with
his
short
legs
or
riding
on
the
pedals
away
from
the
saddle
when
his
father
was
not
looking
he
was
his
father
companion
many
hours
of
each
day
for
nan
was
often
tired
his
father
had
plentiful
opportunities
for
judging
just
how
was
his
child
one
morning
on
going
down
to
bathe
the
sea
was
rough
and
peter
reluctant
to
enter
and
still
more
reluctant
to
own
it
made
the
excuse
that
he
was
frightened
of
treading
on
a
dead
sailor
peter
after
hearing
a
sermon
at
the
village
chapel
grew
profoundly
sorry
for
the
devil
it
seemed
so
dreadful
to
have
to
burn
for
ever
and
ever
he
made
a
secret
promise
to
god
that
he
would
take
the
place
then
he
thought
it
over
for
some
days
in
horror
he
had
been
too
generous
he
wanted
to
go
back
on
his
bargain
his
mother
found
him
crying
one
night
she
suspected
that
he
had
been
sleeping
little
by
the
dark
blue
rings
under
his
eyes
she
coaxed
him
and
he
told
her
another
sign
of
his
was
his
anxiety
to
know
whether
cows
had
souls
boy
thinks
too
much
said
his
father
needs
to
rough
and
tumble
with
other
boys
of
his
own
age
at
ten
his
worst
trouble
should
be
nan
smiled
peter
different
you
know
but
if
he
to
grow
up
strong
he
must
change
little
woman
i
do
like
boy
i
sometimes
think
it
our
doing
yours
and
mine
when
we
put
toys
in
the
empty
nursery
before
he
was
born
before
he
was
thought
of
we
were
making
him
a
sins
of
the
parents
eh
that
the
love
of
the
parents
shall
be
visited
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
you
know
more
about
god
and
peter
and
love
than
i
do
you
right
and
you
always
right
how
is
it
that
you
learn
so
much
by
sitting
so
quiet
matters
came
to
a
head
through
kay
in
the
cottage
where
they
stayed
peter
slept
with
her
in
the
same
bed
in
a
narrow
room
beneath
a
sloping
roof
she
was
nervous
to
be
left
alone
there
it
was
so
dark
so
far
away
so
strange
peter
a
willing
martyr
went
to
bed
with
her
at
the
same
time
lying
awake
in
the
dark
or
twilight
he
would
tell
her
stories
kay
in
a
little
drowsy
voice
as
she
grew
more
sleepy
she
would
snuggle
closer
with
her
lips
against
his
face
till
at
last
he
knew
by
her
regular
breathing
that
his
audience
was
indifferent
to
his
wildest
fancies
one
evening
his
parents
returned
from
a
ride
and
entering
the
house
heard
a
stifled
sobbing
that
be
the
wait
here
nan
i
go
up
and
quiet
i
come
up
as
they
climbed
the
stairs
and
reached
the
landing
they
made
out
words
which
were
in
the
wailing
do
want
to
be
a
dead
i
do
want
to
be
a
dead
it
was
kay
voice
peter
leaning
over
her
was
whispering
frightened
comfort
when
nan
and
billy
had
taken
them
in
their
arms
and
lit
the
candle
the
tragedy
was
explained
peter
had
been
enlarging
on
the
magnificence
of
heaven
and
the
beauties
of
the
future
life
things
went
well
until
kay
realized
that
there
was
no
direct
communication
by
trains
or
buses
between
heaven
and
her
parents
she
did
want
to
go
there
its
magnificence
unshared
by
anyone
she
loved
was
terrifying
she
want
to
be
a
dead
she
kept
repeating
it
in
spite
of
peter
best
efforts
at
consolation
it
was
some
time
before
it
was
safe
to
blow
the
candle
out
and
leave
them
death
was
very
imminent
in
their
minds
downstairs
when
it
was
all
over
billy
looked
across
at
nan
his
brow
puckered
with
annoyance
and
his
lips
twitching
with
laughter
decides
how
what
does
it
decide
that
i
thought
of
for
a
long
time
peter
too
imaginative
he
not
a
good
companion
for
can
you
say
that
we
all
know
how
gentle
he
is
with
just
it
it
good
for
neither
of
them
now
that
jehane
and
ocky
are
at
sandport
it
makes
things
easier
they
can
keep
an
eye
on
eye
on
peter
billy
leant
across
the
table
turning
down
the
lamp
and
turning
it
up
again
he
was
gaining
time
for
his
own
good
you
do
suppose
i
like
it
it
be
hard
for
all
of
he
spoke
huskily
nan
plucked
at
the
she
was
almost
angry
mean
that
you
want
to
send
him
to
school
at
send
my
little
peterkins
away
famous
for
its
billy
you
could
be
so
cruel
he
so
young
and
sensitive
his
heart
would
i
was
sent
to
when
i
was
eight
you
were
different
but
peter
she
voiced
the
common
fallacy
of
mothers
that
their
husbands
as
boys
were
of
coarser
fibre
than
their
children
she
bowed
her
head
on
her
arms
beneath
the
lamp
and
cried
her
little
peter
to
be
thrust
out
and
made
lonely
simply
because
he
had
too
much
imagination
it
was
cruel
chapter
xiii
prickcautions
there
was
no
withstanding
his
questions
peter
had
to
be
told
why
it
was
because
he
was
too
peterish
he
was
going
for
the
good
of
kay
all
these
years
in
trying
so
hard
to
love
her
he
had
been
harming
her
it
amounted
to
that
as
he
understood
it
he
was
being
sent
to
school
that
he
might
learn
to
be
like
other
children
like
riska
and
eustace
for
instance
i
quite
like
them
can
i
come
home
ah
that
was
in
the
future
unknowingly
he
had
committed
an
indiscretion
the
penalty
for
which
was
exile
the
indiscretion
was
called
he
felt
horribly
ashamed
even
though
grace
did
assure
him
that
some
of
the
very
greatest
people
had
been
guilty
of
the
same
mistake
master
peter
you
gettin
orf
lightly
that
you
are
there
was
once
a
young
fellah
as
dreamed
dreams
about
sheaves
bowin
down
to
and
the
moon
and
stars
makin
a
basin
for
know
wot
think
that
silly
said
peter
could
the
moon
and
stars
make
a
basin
silly
neither
it
says
it
in
the
bible
when
told
dreams
know
wot
brethren
they
chucked
in
a
pit
yes
they
did
and
there
stayed
for
keeps
if
it
been
for
a
passin
circus
as
saw
was
queer
and
put
in
their
show
and
took
away
into
egypt
oh
my
for
a
boy
wiv
you
gettin
orf
did
he
do
in
the
circus
did
he
ever
come
home
again
grew
to
be
a
ruler
in
and
saved
pa
and
ma
and
eleven
brethren
when
they
wuz
i
do
that
for
all
of
you
one
silly
little
monkey
there
yer
go
again
wiv
yer
queer
peter
had
been
to
the
agricultural
hall
in
islington
and
had
seen
people
in
without
arms
and
legs
bearded
women
men
horrid
persons
with
one
body
and
two
heads
or
with
a
little
twin
without
even
one
head
growing
out
of
their
chests
and
waggling
their
pitiful
legs
he
was
like
that
in
his
body
but
he
supposed
he
must
be
something
like
it
inside
his
head
the
belief
that
he
was
somehow
deformed
made
him
too
humble
too
abashed
to
protest
anything
that
was
for
his
little
sister
sake
must
be
right
but
he
wished
that
someone
had
warned
him
earlier
only
in
this
did
he
feel
himself
anyhow
never
in
his
wildest
fancies
had
he
supposed
that
the
moon
and
stars
could
make
basins
and
that
boy
joseph
had
turned
out
all
right
now
he
was
going
to
his
particular
egypt
to
get
cured
taking
him
on
his
knee
his
father
had
explained
matters
he
was
to
be
a
little
knight
and
not
to
cry
he
was
to
ride
out
into
the
world
alone
for
the
good
of
the
lady
he
loved
best
one
day
he
would
return
to
her
and
then
with
his
mother
it
was
different
she
wept
and
quite
evidently
expected
him
to
weep
too
she
did
want
him
to
go
it
was
not
her
doing
she
loved
him
to
be
peterish
she
would
not
have
him
otherwise
to
her
he
could
confess
here
mother
tapping
his
breast
ca
help
it
really
but
i
no
he
could
help
it
that
was
the
worst
of
it
any
more
than
he
could
help
hearing
the
whistling
angel
he
could
pretend
that
he
peter
just
as
he
had
pretended
not
to
hear
the
angel
whistle
but
he
would
not
be
able
to
change
he
could
only
learn
to
wear
a
disguise
if
school
could
teach
him
to
do
that
years
hence
he
might
prove
worthy
to
live
again
at
topbury
because
he
felt
that
he
was
to
blame
he
strove
to
be
very
brave
if
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
sometimes
it
because
he
wanted
them
to
the
respite
shortened
letters
passed
to
and
fro
between
his
father
and
uncle
waffles
between
his
mother
and
aunt
jehane
their
contents
discussed
at
the
breakfast
table
cast
a
gloom
over
all
the
day
many
schools
were
offered
but
the
best
for
peter
particular
case
was
one
kept
by
miss
lydia
rufus
aunt
jehane
would
look
after
his
clothes
and
he
could
spend
his
saturdays
at
madeira
lodge
madeira
lodge
that
was
the
house
at
sandport
which
sheltered
uncle
waffles
it
was
stamped
in
red
letters
at
the
top
of
his
and
proclaimed
magnificence
it
rather
tickled
peter
father
sense
of
humor
from
madeira
lodge
he
would
say
with
a
twinkle
as
he
sorted
out
the
letters
why
stop
in
intemperance
why
not
port
wine
terrace
moselle
park
in
the
town
of
champagne
ocky
too
or
he
would
say
sauterne
of
beer
castle
informs
his
nephew
that
miss
rufus
pupils
require
a
bible
an
eton
suit
and
two
pairs
of
peter
would
greet
his
father
jokes
with
a
strained
but
gallant
little
smile
men
must
keep
up
the
women
courage
his
father
had
told
him
it
was
hard
to
keep
up
other
people
courage
when
your
own
was
down
to
zero
by
the
time
they
left
the
cottage
in
north
wales
everything
had
been
arranged
there
was
just
one
short
fortnight
left
in
which
to
get
peter
wardrobe
together
mark
his
linen
and
finish
off
his
mending
and
sewing
the
mornings
were
spent
in
visits
to
shops
where
boots
and
gloves
and
suits
were
fitted
on
and
purchased
a
knight
when
he
rides
into
the
world
alone
must
set
out
duly
caparisoned
and
peter
was
thankful
for
the
rush
and
muddle
he
found
it
increasingly
difficult
not
to
cry
especially
when
his
mother
strained
him
to
her
breast
and
gazed
down
on
him
lovingly
with
her
dear
wet
eyes
he
was
glad
that
people
should
have
so
much
to
do
for
he
hardly
knew
how
to
conduct
himself
since
the
discovery
of
his
awful
blemish
he
was
afraid
to
show
his
affection
for
his
little
sister
in
the
old
fond
ways
and
he
could
think
of
no
new
ways
of
showing
it
he
had
come
to
the
last
day
it
was
one
of
those
days
when
summer
droops
her
eyes
and
confesses
that
she
has
grown
old
there
was
just
a
hint
of
tears
in
the
sky
a
blue
film
of
vapor
which
softened
the
valiant
smiling
of
grass
and
leaves
decaying
in
the
garden
the
last
of
the
roses
were
falling
and
virginia
creeper
lay
like
crusted
blood
upon
the
walls
it
was
as
though
summer
like
a
spendthrift
woman
put
red
upon
her
cheeks
to
pretend
she
was
not
dying
peter
in
his
sensitive
way
was
conscious
of
the
sadness
of
this
vain
pretending
this
mimicking
a
beauty
that
was
gone
he
was
doing
the
same
preparing
for
and
at
the
same
time
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
the
present
was
forever
that
would
never
dawn
he
ran
up
and
down
the
house
trying
to
seem
merry
and
excited
watching
his
boxes
being
corded
laughing
and
chattering
talking
of
when
he
would
return
for
christmas
men
must
keep
up
the
one
of
the
women
was
kay
he
was
doing
his
best
to
be
a
little
knight
it
hurt
sometimes
especially
when
his
mother
looked
up
from
fitting
socks
and
shoes
into
odd
corners
of
his
boxes
unhappy
and
surprised
she
must
think
him
she
should
never
guess
after
lunch
having
watched
his
opportunity
he
slipped
out
of
the
house
without
letting
anyone
know
where
he
was
going
his
face
was
set
in
a
solemn
expression
of
serious
determination
he
scuttled
down
the
terrace
and
down
the
crescent
till
he
came
within
sight
of
the
he
was
relieved
to
find
that
grace
as
he
called
grace
father
was
disengaged
grace
was
a
fat
man
and
like
many
fat
and
men
had
his
grievance
his
appearance
was
against
him
people
judged
him
circumstantially
and
said
that
he
drank
even
grace
said
it
his
stand
was
suspiciously
near
topbury
cock
but
most
are
near
to
some
public
house
peter
had
become
his
very
dear
friend
and
to
him
grace
had
opened
his
heart
denying
all
charges
and
imputing
the
redness
of
his
countenance
to
the
severity
of
his
calling
and
exposure
to
the
weather
grace
was
asleep
on
his
box
his
face
stuffed
deep
in
his
collar
the
reins
sagging
from
his
swollen
hands
as
if
at
any
minute
he
might
drive
off
when
peter
spoke
to
him
he
jumped
himself
together
sir
right
sir
ready
well
i
blessed
strike
me
blind
if
it
ai
the
little
peter
spread
apart
his
legs
thrusting
his
hands
deep
in
his
knickerbocker
pockets
going
to
be
sent
away
grace
and
grace
twisted
his
head
as
if
trying
to
lengthen
his
fat
neck
finding
that
impossible
he
shifted
his
ponderous
body
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
seat
and
regarded
peter
with
his
kind
little
pig
eyes
peter
well
i
never
worried
for
kay
i
sha
be
here
to
take
care
of
his
voice
fluttered
then
steadied
itself
as
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
finished
bravely
do

neck

become
sore
with

so
he
tempted
peter
to
come
on
the
box
puffing
and
blowing
he
gave
him
a
hand
to
help
him
when
they
were
seated

looked
fondly
at

chapter
xiv
peter
in
egypt
miss
lydia
rufus
was
a
prim
person
judging
from
her
appearance
one
would
have
said
that
in
her
case
virtue
was
compulsory
through
lack
of
opportunity
and
yet
she
had
had
her
that
was
how
she
referred
to
it
in
conversations
with
her
maker
no
one
in
sandport
save
herself
and
god
knew
about
it
it
had
happened
ten
years
before
peter
became
her
pupil
the
had
been
born
anonymously
as
one
might
say
and
had
been
brought
up
after
the
first
unavoidable
preliminaries
for
which
her
presence
was
indispensable
she
and
the
had
separated
she
hardly
ever
dared
to
see
it
for
she
was
alone
in
the
world
and
had
her
living
to
earn
to
do
that
one
must
appear
respectable
for
a
woman
of
such
bristling
righteousness
to
have
been
so
yielding
as
to
have
had
an
was
almost
to
her
credit
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
de
like
passing
a
camel
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
or
any
other
form
of
occult
acrobatics
it
was
a
miracle
in
and
often
in
the
night
her
heart
went
out
in
longing
for
the
child
whom
she
dared
not
acknowledge
in
her
soul
which
most
people
regarded
as
an
a
sanctuary
was
established
with
an
altar
of
on
which
the
candles
of
yearning
were
kept
burning
this
chapter
in
her
secret
history
would
never
have
been
mentioned
had
she
not
made
peter
the
proxy
of
her
because
he
was
ten
and
because
he
was
handsome
it
was
lucky
for
peter
her
usual
attitude
toward
children
was
one
of
condemnation
she
expiated
her
own
sin
by
uprooting
the
old
adam
from
the
hearts
of
her
pupils
in
her
vigor
and
diligence
she
often
uprooted
flowers
for
the
rest
she
was
a
high
church
woman
wore
boots
and
never
permitted
anything
to
be
placed
on
a
bible
her
system
of
education
was
one
of
moral
peter
found
himself
in
a
cramped
new
house
in
a
raw
new
street
on
the
outskirts
of
a
town
the
wind
seemed
always
to
be
blowing
and
in
whichever
direction
he
walked
he
always
came
to
sand
it
was
as
though
this
place
had
been
planted
in
a
desert
that
escape
might
be
impossible
twenty
other
little
boys
about
his
own
age
were
his
when
the
school
was
marched
out
walking
two
abreast
with
miss
rufus
sternly
bringing
up
the
tail
of
the
procession
he
would
meet
other
crocodiles
of
boys
and
girls
sedately
parading
followed
by
their
warders
these
public
promenades
were
a
part
of
the
advertisement
deportment
was
strictly
observed
sandport
as
peter
knew
it
was
a
settlement
for
miss
rufus
soon
formed
the
habit
of
keeping
him
to
walk
with
her
at
first
this
caused
him
embarrassment
little
by
little
how
was
it
he
became
aware
that
with
him
she
was
different
as
the
mood
took
her
she
spoke
to
him
sharply
was
merely
forbidding
or
was
so
kind
that
he
forgot
the
sourness
of
her
corrugated
countenance
and
the
ugly
color
of
her
hair
it
was
instinctive
with
him
to
treat
all
women
as
he
did
his
mother
with
quaint
chivalry
and
forethought
an
attitude
of
gallantry
in
a
pupil
was
something
new
to
miss
rufus
when
they
came
to
the
miles
of
beach
all
tawny
like
a
golden
mantle
spread
out
with
a
thread
of
silver
in
the
far
far
distance
where
the
sea
washed
its
hem
instead
of
going
to
romp
with
the
other
boys
he
sat
himself
down
beside
her
and
play
she
told
him
you
be
alone
was
always
alone
before
you
i
here
he
stood
before
her
laughing
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
and
the
wind
in
his
hair
he
showed
no
fear
of
her
that
was
not
his
way
with
strangers
she
gazed
in
his
face
the
gray
eyes
the
flushed
cheeks
the
red
mouth
this
was
not
the
sullen
little
slave
of
her
normal
experience
in
spite
of
herself
his
bright
intelligence
and
willingness
to
be
loved
stirred
something
in
her
breast
if
she
had
not
cared
what
people
had
thought
of
her
if
she
had
been
brave
her
child
might
have
been
like
that
her
chapped
features
grew
wistful
peter
looking
at
her
saw
only
a
disagreeable
faded
woman
with
red
hair
do
like
me
do
you
i
like
everyone
said
peter
do
know
you
a
cross
old
woman
if
you
do
mind
losing
your
play
you
can
come
and
sit
beside
and
peter
sat
down
it
was
dull
for
him
across
the
sands
boats
on
wheels
raced
with
spread
sails
dashing
toward
the
silver
thread
ponies
which
you
could
hire
for
a
few
pennies
were
galloping
up
and
down
across
the
flat
beach
like
a
monstrous
centipede
with
trestles
for
legs
the
long
pier
crawled
with
its
head
in
the
sea
and
its
tail
on
land
and
the
pier
had
its
own
delirious
excitements
on
show
in
the
casino
at
the
end
was
a
troop
of
performing
fleas
who
drove
one
another
in
the
tiniest
of
peter
knew
because
a
named
ethel
had
been
lost
a
reward
for
her
recovery
was
advertised
all
over
sandport
ten
shillings
were
offered
and
hundreds
of
fleas
had
been
submitted
for
inspection
peter
had
a
wild
dream
that
he
might
find
ethel
with
ten
shillings
he
could
escape
to
london
from
this
egypt
of
exile
in
the
sand
miss
rufus
broke
in
on
his
reverie
she
had
been
wondering
how
anyone
who
had
the
right
to
peter
could
be
so
foolish
as
to
do
without
him
did
they
send
you
me
to
you
i
made
kay
cry
about
know
what
it
says
about
heaven
in
the
bible
that
no
marriage
was
that
what
she
cried
about
would
cry
about
a
thing
like
that
she
my
little
sister
littler
than
me
and
she
never
going
to
marry
we
going
to
live
together
always
and
have
chipped
potatoes
and
sausages
for
a
smile
twisted
the
thin
straight
lips
of
the
sallow
woman
it
was
the
first
that
peter
had
seen
there
it
was
almost
tender
like
a
thing
forgotten
coming
back
he
laughed
he
was
always
ready
to
laugh
at
himself
think
funny
father
thinks
it
funny
too
he
says
peterkins
time
change
all
that
but
it
wo
you
know
we
mean
it
would
it
be
very
sad
not
to
marry
would
you
like
one
day
to
have
a
little
boy
just
like
yourself
he
shook
his
head
an
awful
worry
no
i
do
think
so
but
like
to
have
a
little
girl
like
kay
and
i
have
her
the
arm
of
the
sallow
woman
stole
round
his
shoulder
says
an
awful
worry
why
i
here
you
know
i
worried
them
with
my
queer
questions
when
i
the
same
as
other
people
they
let
me
come
do
think
you
a
worry
i
hope
you
never
be
like
anyone
you
must
say
that
you
to
change
me
i
glad
you
like
be
glad
i
love
you
she
whispered
the
lonely
woman
heart
opened
to
peter
he
told
her
all
about
kay
and
grace
and
romance
he
thought
she
ought
to
know
everything
since
she
was
to
cure
him
but
instead
of
curing
him
she
almost
almost
made
him
worse
there
was
a
strange
furtiveness
in
their
relation
the
other
boys
must
not
suspect
miss
rufus
despised
favoritism
she
tried
to
be
very
hard
on
peter
in
he
understood
and
smiled
to
himself
he
was
terribly
homesick
he
wanted
kay
badly
he
wanted
to
hear
her
laughter
he
marked
each
hour
by
what
they
were
doing
at
topbury
now
they
were
sitting
down
to
breakfast
now
kay
was
going
with
his
mother
shopping
now
the
dinner
was
being
set
and
his
father
key
was
grating
in
the
latch
sounds
and
smells
would
bring
sudden
and
stabbing
remembrance
he
would
hear
the
garden
with
the
dead
leaves
rustling
see
the
nursery
gleaming
in
the
firelight
and
a
little
girl
being
made
ready
for
bed
oh
she
must
be
frightened
without
peter
at
the
top
of
that
tall
dark
house
at
night
when
miss
rufus
broke
her
rule
against
favoritism
and
stealing
to
his
room
pressed
his
head
against
her
bony
breast
while
he
said
his
prayers
it
was
then
that
he
thought
of
his
mother
with
most
poignancy
but
he
was
to
be
a
little
knight
so
those
weekly
letters
which
commenced
were
written
stoutheartedly
they
must
never
guess
but
nan
saw
the
tremble
in
the
sprawling
hand
and
the
blots
where
diluted
ink
had
spread
boy
we
must
have
him
back
i
ca
bear
darling
the
chap
quite
is
he
is
and
you
know
it
kay
wants
him
she
fretting
i
want
him
and
you
want
him
as
much
as
any
of
us
i
want
to
hear
his
footsteps
on
the
stairs
to
see
his
clothes
lying
about
and
and
it
is
what
we
want
little
nan
it
what
best
for
him
as
nervous
as
a
cat
always
has
been
give
him
a
year
of
nan
missed
him
terribly
no
merry
voice
awoke
her
in
the
morning
the
ceiling
above
her
bed
never
shook
with
childish
prancing
kay
by
herself
was
very
quiet
she
was
always
asking
where
was
peter
had
he
gone
to
heaven
but
it
was
when
she
came
home
at
nightfall
along
the
terrace
that
longing
was
most
intense
childhood
would
be
all
too
short
at
best
too
soon
the
years
would
take
him
from
her
one
day
she
would
give
anything
for
just
one
evening
of
the
joy
that
she
now
might
have
who
could
tell
what
the
future
held
an
old
woman
grayheaded
she
would
sit
and
whisper
to
herself
to
come
home
once
more
when
the
dusk
is
falling
to
see
the
nursery
lighted
and
the
children
table
spread
mother
mother
the
eager
voices
calling
baby
was
so
sleepy
that
she
had
to
go
to
bed
thinking
these
thoughts
nan
would
sink
her
face
in
her
hands
foretasting
the
solitude
that
was
surely
coming
but
it
was
for
peter
good
his
father
said
he
looked
very
intently
at
the
dutch
landscape
by
cuyp
seeking
quiet
from
it
when
he
said
it
as
for
curing
him
miss
rufus
was
the
wrong
person
to
do
that
peter
was
aware
of
it
he
had
made
her
as
bad
as
himself
he
had
set
her
loving
he
must
look
for
help
elsewhere
on
saturdays
waffles
called
for
him
quite
a
splendid
waffles
with
soaped
mustaches
and
rather
shabby
spats
he
was
taken
to
madeira
lodge
shiny
with
its
newly
purchased
highly
polished
furniture
in
the
afternoons
he
walked
with
waffles
to
birchdale
where
the
dunes
stretched
away
in
billows
of
sand
and
the
air
was
always
blowy
in
the
evenings
he
played
with
his
cousins
till
it
was
time
to
return
to
miss
rufus
across
the
road
from
madeira
lodge
was
a
methodist
chapel
and
beside
it
a
plot
of
waste
land
to
this
place
he
would
escape
when
he
got
the
chance
the
grass
grew
rank
it
was
easy
to
hide
among
the
withered
he
had
come
to
a
great
conclusion
no
one
but
god
could
cure
him
there
behind
the
methodist
chapel
he
argued
with
god
about
it
praying
for
kay
sake
that
he
might
be
made
well
nothing
happened
perhaps
because
glory
found
him
and
having
found
him
was
always
following
him
to
his
place
of
hiding
he
pledged
her
to
secrecy
told
her
his
trouble
and
asked
her
advice
about
it
but
she
only
stared
with
dumb
love
in
her
eyes
and
shook
her
quiet
head
of
his
longing
to
return
he
did
not
dare
to
speak
to
miss
rufus
she
was
too
fond
of
him
nor
must
he
mention
it
in
his
letters
aunt
jehane
ah
well
she
spoke
of
his
parents
as
though
they
were
entirely
mistaken
about
everything
she
was
always
trying
to
prove
to
him
how
much
more
clever
and
generous
she
and
uncle
waffles
were
her
jealous
nature
prompted
her
to
steal
the
boy
heart
by
every
expedient
of
kindness
and
flattery
she
told
him
scandal
about
her
neighbors
she
spoke
of
love
between
boys
and
girls
she
made
him
kiss
glory
and
laughed
at
his
awkwardness
she
gave
him
special
treats
at
his
meals
she
boasted
about
her
husband
saying
how
well
he
was
getting
on
and
how
much
he
would
do
for
peter
and
she
did
all
this
that
peter
might
tell
her
that
he
was
happier
at
sandport
than
at
topbury
peter
could
tell
her
that
he
had
commenced
her
acquaintance
with
a
prejudice
he
could
never
forget
that
she
had
once
been
the
smacking
lady
he
watched
her
with
his
cousins
how
she
was
foolishly
lenient
or
foolishly
severe
but
wise
never
she
allowed
herself
to
punish
them
unjustly
but
if
anyone
even
their
father
blamed
them
they
were
and
especially
was
this
the
case
with
glory
in
whose
making
waffles
could
claim
no
share
she
could
always
humble
his
uncle
by
speaking
regretfully
of
captain
spashett
for
uncle
waffles
peter
had
a
fellow
sympathy
it
was
to
him
he
turned
on
those
walks
among
the
they
had
fine
talks
together
son
i
did
a
big
stroke
of
business
this
week
oh
yes
i
tell
you
this
little
boy
knows
his
way
about
town
had
two
more
acres
offered
me
and
borrowed
money
for
the
purchase
they
a
long
way
out
but
sandport
grow
to
them
now
what
know
about
that
uncle
waffles
was
often
confessional
with
peter
and
always
exuberant
he
asked
his
opinion
on
business
affairs
as
though
his
opinion
mattered
he
seemed
to
keep
nothing
back
even
touching
on
things
domestic
must
think
i
complaining
of
the
duchess
she
a
snorter
but
you
know
she
never
understood
me
i
taking
her
in
hand
though
and
educating
her
up
to
my
standard
when
first
i
knew
her
she
seemed
to
think
that
loving
was
wicked
now
what
know
about
that
peter
watched
for
the
results
of
the
educating
and
was
disappointed
when
uncle
waffles
tried
to
kiss
aunt
she
still
drew
aside
her
head
saying
be
silly
she
left
the
room
when
he
began
to
tell
his
latest
funny
story
it
was
odd
if
he
was
really
successful
that
she
should
always
treat
him
like
that
and
there
were
other
secrets
peter
learnt
that
his
uncle
had
an
obscure
disease
which
no
one
must
mention
his
uncle
was
very
brave
and
laughed
about
it
it
could
be
kept
in
check
so
long
as
he
took
his
regularly
his
could
be
obtained
at
any
public
house
and
was
frequently
obtained
on
those
saturday
excursions
to
and
from
birchdale
when
glory
accompanied
them
uncle
waffles
contrived
to
do
without
it
at
christmas
peter
was
put
in
charge
of
the
guard
and
returned
to
topbury
the
month
that
followed
was
a
bitter
pleasure
like
a
man
living
on
his
capital
he
was
always
reckoning
how
much
was
left
and
then
the
respite
ended
and
the
exile
in
egypt
recommenced
he
clenched
his
hands
he
would
not
cry
and
yet
it
was
kay
he
wanted
his
whole
life
was
wrapt
up
in
her
the
first
day
back
at
school
he
noticed
that
one
of
his
companions
was
absent
the
second
and
the
third
day
passed
then
the
news
leaked
out
that
he
was
dead
it
dawned
on
peter
that
death
was
a
peril
that
threatened
everybody
no
amount
of
care
on
the
part
of
grace
or
the
policeman
could
shield
kay
from
it
the
thought
became
a
nightmare
miss
rufus
discovered
that
he
was
unhappy
he
cried
at
night
in
bed
she
was
hurt
but
when
he
told
her
she
was
more
gentle
with
him
than
ever
midway
through
the
term
a
telegram
arrived
its
message
was
broken
to
him
by
uncle
waffles
kay
was
dangerously
ill
and
calling
for
him
he
was
to
go
back
a
drizzling
rain
hung
over
london
the
streets
were
clogged
with
mud
and
shone
drearily
through
the
drifting
murk
throughout
the
long
and
dismal
journey
he
had
sat
in
the
intervals
between
praying
he
had
told
himself
that
were
she
to
die
he
would
never
forgive
his
father
for
having
separated
him
from
her
he
was
stunned
and
yet
fiercely
rebellious
in
spite
of
his
desperate
hope
he
was
prepared
for
the
worst
at
the
station
grace
met
him
indiscreet
through
grief
she
told
him
how
from
the
first
of
her
three
days
illness
his
little
sister
had
never
ceased
calling
for
him
runned
up
with
fretting
poor
lamb
but
you
was
allaws
to
quiet
master
before
the
cab
had
halted
on
the
terrace
peter
was
up
the
steps
someone
had
been
behind
the
blinds
watching
the
door
opened
almost
before
he
had
rung
the
bell
his
father
stood
before
him
in
his
hot
anger
peter
dodged
beneath
his
arm
and
commenced
to
mount
the
stairs
if
he
had
been
there
he
felt
sure
this
would
not
have
happened
from
the
room
in
which
she
had
been
born
came
the
heavy
smell
of
eucalyptus
peter
opened
the
door
a
fire
was
burning
as
when
he
had
first
found
her
there
a
cot
was
drawn
up
to
the
fire
and
from
it
came
a
ceaseless
tired
wailing
in
the
wailing
he
made
out
his
name
uttered
over
and
over
as
he
ran
forward
his
mother
rose
to
put
her
arms
about
him
he
rushed
past
her
she
did
not
count
bending
over
the
cot
he
gazed
into
the
flushed
face
the
hoarse
voice
stopped
the
lips
cracked
with
fever
pressed
against
his
mouth
kay
it
truly
peter
he
never
going
to
leave
from
the
moment
he
touched
her
she
began
to
mend
some
days
later
when
relief
from
suspense
left
leisure
for
attention
to
other
matters
barrington
wrote
to
miss
rufus
saying
that
his
son
would
not
return
in
reply
he
received
a
curious
confidence
she
had
advertised
her
school
for
sale
and
it
was
peter
doing
peter
had
taught
her
that
except
love
nothing
mattered
peter
father
had
seen
miss
rufus
he
thought
that
love
on
her
lips
was
an
odd
word
could
one
love
and
still
keep
a
school
it
was
very
of
peter
to
make
a
lady
with
a
corrugated
countenance
do
a
thing
like
that
something
lay
behind
the
letter
later
when
the
scandal
had
become
public
jehane
informed
them
what
that
something
was
peter
father
felt
penitent
he
took
his
son
between
his
knees
resting
his
hand
on
his
curly
head
and
gazed
at
him
intently
as
though
for
the
first
time
he
was
beginning
to
know
him
you
forgiven
me
little
chap
then
was
mistaken
about
you
your
mother
was
right
go
on
being
to
your
heart
content
we
love
you
best
like
to
nan
he
said
should
have
seen
that
woman
she
was
barbed
wire
all
round
impregnable
absolutely
but
peter
well
we
got
a
queer
little
shrimp
for
our
son
and
chapter
xv
married
life
peter
went
laughing
through
the
it
had
become
all
kindness
in
some
strange
way
he
had
saved
kay
life
everybody
said
so
he
did
not
know
how
and
now
she
was
strong
and
well
more
his
than
ever
master
peter
grace
would
say
when
they
met
on
the
yes
peter
was
always
happy
now
his
eyes
were
blue
torches
of
joy
which
burnt
up
other
people
sadness
his
golden
little
motherkins
forgot
her
dread
of
when
he
would
become
a
man
she
held
him
tightly
in
the
nest
at
topbury
surrounding
him
with
her
gentle
love
his
father
showed
his
affection
in
a
man
fashion
by
making
peter
his
friend
and
kay
racing
down
the
and
dancing
with
the
flowers
in
the
sunshine
put
the
feeling
which
they
all
experienced
into
words
joy
gone
into
my
feet
peter
i
so
never
again
would
anyone
suspect
him
of
harming
her
he
could
gather
her
to
him
and
tell
her
tales
to
his
heart
content
and
what
games
of
pretending
they
played
together
the
garden
became
a
forest
of
limitless
expanse
and
the
house
a
castle
kay
was
a
princess
in
danger
and
peter
was
a
knight
who
came
to
her
rescue
peter
taught
his
mother
and
father
his
so
that
they
might
play
their
part
as
king
and
queen
of
the
castle
peter
father
learnt
that
he
did
not
go
to
business
in
the
morning
but
to
the
wars
in
the
evening
when
he
returned
he
would
sometimes
see
two
merry
faces
watching
for
him
from
the
the
were
the
battlements
then
he
felt
that
grown
man
though
he
was
he
ought
to
prance
up
the
terrace
as
his
legs
would
have
done
had
they
been
really
those
of
a
royal
charger
peter
had
brought
back
the
spirit
of
to
in
the
garden
by
day
where
the
wind
whispered
round
the
walls
and
the
trees
let
in
glimpses
of
clouds
and
in
the
nursery
at
twilight
where
the
laburnum
leant
her
arms
on
the
to
listen
nodding
her
golden
tassels
he
created
his
imaginary
world
here
the
king
and
queen
would
join
them
almost
shyly
as
if
they
feared
that
their
presence
might
disturb
they
came
on
tiptoe
peter
noticed
how
different
they
were
from
aunt
jehane
and
uncle
waffles
they
were
never
tired
of
being
lovers
peter
we
want
to
be
your
little
boy
and
girl
may
we
hear
your
story
the
invisible
arms
of
the
threatened
death
had
drawn
them
very
near
together
like
the
spring
about
them
their
hearts
were
emotional
with
exultant
tenderness
like
all
children
kay
and
peter
had
their
place
of
hiding
where
they
lived
their
most
secret
world
it
was
the
loft
above
the
unused
stable
one
had
to
climb
up
boxes
and
scramble
through
a
hole
in
the
ceiling
to
get
to
it
it
was
thick
in
dust
and
but
they
cleaned
a
space
where
they
could
sit
and
pretend
it
was
their
house
and
that
they
were
married
there
was
only
one
window
smothered
in
ivy
looking
out
on
the
garden
from
here
they
could
observe
whether
anyone
was
coming
there
were
chinks
in
the
floor
which
served
as
through
one
of
them
they
could
see
the
stall
in
which
the
was
kept
they
planned
to
explore
all
manner
of
countries
when
kay
legs
were
long
enough
to
reach
the
pedals
think
where
you
kiddies
get
to
their
father
said
believe
it
somewhere
in
the
stable
i
been
calling
and
and
peter
laughed
for
he
knew
that
grown
people
were
far
too
sensible
to
think
of
climbing
into
the
loft
in
search
of
them
only
one
grown
person
was
so
adventurous
but
that
comes
later
when
letters
arrived
from
sandport
they
were
usually
addressed
to
nan
as
a
rule
the
first
post
brought
them
and
she
would
read
out
extracts
as
they
sat
at
breakfast
they
were
curious
letters
written
in
a
jealous
spirit
but
intended
to
create
an
impression
of
contentment
they
were
in
the
nature
of
veiled
retorts
which
said
you
see
my
husband
as
good
as
without
knowing
it
they
betrayed
envy
if
nan
had
given
news
concerning
the
doings
of
herself
billy
or
her
children
jehane
would
reply
with
parallel
details
concerning
her
family
just
as
in
conversation
she
spoke
of
her
husband
as
waffles
as
though
the
very
name
were
a
title
inspiring
awe
so
in
correspondence
she
quoted
his
opinions
as
a
loving
wife
would
the
sayings
of
a
man
she
worshiped
jehane
wrote
less
and
less
in
the
mood
of
spontaneous
friendship
if
she
had
nothing
better
to
say
one
wondered
that
she
took
the
trouble
to
write
at
all
probably
she
did
it
out
of
habit
and
perhaps
in
order
to
hoodwink
herself
and
she
was
evasive
questions
as
to
how
ocky
enterprise
was
progressing
were
left
unanswered
in
place
of
answers
were
loose
optimistic
statements
a
letter
from
sandport
usually
brought
with
it
an
atmosphere
of
annoyance
nan
exercised
her
tact
in
selecting
portions
to
be
read
aloud
it
was
in
keeping
with
ocky
character
that
even
when
barrington
had
written
himself
jehane
did
the
replying
saying
that
her
husband
was
very
busy
at
present
with
new
developments
one
morning
nan
passed
a
letter
down
the
table
without
comment
barrington
brows
drew
together
in
a
frown
halfway
through
reading
it
he
flung
it
from
him
well
i
must
say
they
might
have
waited
until
they
knew
whether
they
could
afford
nan
interrupted
him
quietly
not
before
she
glanced
at
the
children
when
they
were
supposed
to
have
forgotten
what
their
father
had
said
kay
and
peter
were
informed
aunt
had
another
little
girl
that
evening
the
king
and
queen
of
the
castle
talked
together
after
the
knight
and
the
princess
had
been
put
to
bed
no
right
to
do
a
thing
like
that
bringing
another
child
into
the
world
jehane
does
love
him
it
my
belief
she
never
has
the
thing
sordid
what
chance
will
the
little
beggar
have
it
puts
the
whole
business
of
marriage
on
a
level
with
the
animals
ugh
they
were
sitting
beneath
the
mulberry
in
the
cool
dusk
from
far
away
like
waves
lapping
against
the
walls
of
a
precipice
in
a
cranny
of
which
they
had
found
shelter
the
weary
complaint
of
london
reached
them
within
his
own
house
with
his
wife
and
children
barrington
felt
lifted
high
above
all
that
he
hated
this
intrusion
of
strife
and
ugliness
nan
arm
stole
round
his
neck
she
had
never
lost
the
shyness
with
which
she
had
given
him
her
first
caress
old
boy
you
be
angry
with
them
only
sorry
do
you
know
we
so
exceptional
as
all
as
all
that
how
many
wives
and
husbands
are
lovers
after
been
married
ten
years
tried
to
many
then
would
choose
one
another
again
if
they
could
begin
afresh
afresh
with
full
knowledge
of
everything
that
was
to
happen
who
are
we
to
judge
we
should
just
be
thankful
for
ourselves
and
sorry
for
it
the
children
i
thinking
of
children
who
are
wanted
begotten
by
parents
who
do
want
one
the
silence
was
broken
by
nan
jehane
was
a
child
like
that
i
often
thought
it
she
always
been
so
hungry
hungry
for
but
jealous
she
does
go
the
right
way
to
work
to
get
has
learnt
no
one
ever
taught
her
she
married
yet
still
on
the
billy
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
for
her
want
you
to
ask
her
as
soon
as
she
well
to
come
here
to
topbury
with
the
baby
she
tired
i
can
feel
it
in
her
letters
i
like
to
help
only
misconstrue
your
help
you
know
that
she
bore
us
to
tears
by
boasting
about
wo
that
be
to
her
credit
her
credit
but
beastly
annoying
if
she
only
believe
in
him
to
his
face
and
cease
shamming
that
she
proud
of
him
behind
his
back
matters
might
mend
she
wo
let
us
make
her
affairs
our
business
some
day
when
it
too
late
she
may
have
to
that
what
i
afraid
but
when
jehane
came
she
set
that
fear
at
rest
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
that
ocky
feet
were
on
the
upward
ladder
she
was
better
dressed
happier
and
had
money
to
spend
she
wore
presents
of
jewelry
which
her
husband
had
given
her
so
she
said
the
money
she
told
them
was
the
result
of
speculations
which
ocky
had
made
for
her
with
the
little
capital
left
by
captain
spashett
she
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
his
cleverness
and
the
happiness
that
was
because
barrington
had
invited
her
personally
naturally
she
kept
this
knowledge
to
herself
nan
had
planned
to
encompass
her
with
the
atmosphere
of
affection
little
gifts
from
jehane
received
in
her
girlhood
were
set
about
the
bedroom
to
awaken
memories
to
let
her
know
how
well
she
was
remembered
jehane
noticed
the
carefully
thought
out
campaign
the
efforts
that
were
made
to
win
her
she
wondered
what
it
all
meant
then
she
realized
and
was
touched
nan
sat
wistfully
beside
her
friend
watching
the
baby
being
put
to
bed
she
kissed
its
little
limbs
with
a
kind
of
reverence
and
ministered
humbly
to
its
helplessness
when
jehane
pressed
its
eager
lips
against
her
breast
nan
eyes
filled
with
tears
jehane
looked
up
questioningly
shall
never
have
another
nan
said
jehane
stretched
out
her
hand
and
drew
nan
to
her
she
could
be
magnanimous
when
for
once
she
found
her
lot
coveted
when
the
baby
had
been
fed
and
was
being
laid
in
its
cot
nan
slipped
to
the
window
and
leant
out
gazing
across
the
roofs
of
holloway
to
hampstead
where
the
sun
hung
red
there
was
no
warning
she
felt
lips
on
her
cheeks
lips
violently
kissing
her
ears
and
neck
she
turned
with
a
throaty
laugh
done
that
for
kissed
you
of
course
i
nan
shook
her
head
like
that
as
though
you
wanted
to
you
done
it
since
we
were
jehane
of
her
impulsiveness
looked
away
been
too
busy
to
make
a
fuss
but
the
feeling
been
do
call
that
making
a
fuss
and
it
is
because
we
been
busy
we
been
drifting
apart
playing
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
with
one
then
before
jehane
could
become
casual
do
so
want
to
be
are
we
friends
in
the
old
sense
we
hard
and
suspicious
and
doubt
one
let
be
friends
in
the
old
sense
you
dear
little
like
peter
when
nan
had
made
up
her
mind
to
be
tender
no
one
could
resist
her
she
treated
jehane
with
sweet
envy
because
of
the
baby
on
her
breast
she
made
believe
that
jehane
was
fragile
and
kept
her
in
bed
for
breakfast
after
barrington
had
been
seen
off
to
business
she
went
up
to
help
her
dress
it
was
in
this
hour
that
jehane
was
most
confessional
she
recalled
the
dreamy
oxford
days
with
their
desperate
dreams
of
love
when
life
was
unexperienced
she
even
spoke
of
the
great
disillusion
that
had
followed
she
spoke
in
general
terms
to
include
all
wives
and
husbands
she
spoke
of
waffles
as
he
had
been
only
that
she
might
praise
him
as
he
had
become
her
fierce
loyalty
to
him
her
wilful
consistency
in
shutting
her
eyes
to
his
faults
was
a
form
of
which
never
faltered
nan
found
a
difficulty
in
pretending
that
he
was
all
that
was
claimed
for
him
they
both
knew
that
he
was
not
still
she
was
convinced
that
he
was
mending
barrington
noticing
the
change
in
jehane
said
are
only
two
things
that
could
do
it
money
or
love
it
is
love
so
we
have
to
believe
that
it
but
it
was
love
love
for
barrington
and
the
effect
of
being
near
him
even
she
herself
wondered
at
how
the
old
infatuation
had
lasted
her
very
bitterness
had
been
a
form
of
love
now
that
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
be
kind
to
her
all
the
passion
in
her
responded
but
she
had
to
disguise
its
response
at
night
with
another
man
child
in
her
arms
she
lay
awake
in
the
darkness
and
silence
she
told
herself
stories
juggling
with
circumstances
once
she
heard
a
tapping
on
her
door
she
crouched
against
the
wall
shuddering
the
handle
turned
nan
stood
on
the
threshold
thought
i
heard
you
guilty
and
angry
jehane
said
nothing
nan
groped
her
way
toward
the
bed
and
found
it
empty
janey
she
called
then
she
saw
her
stooped
to
her
and
caught
her
in
her
arms
begging
for
an
explanation
just
as
once
when
she
had
asserted
i
i
play
fair
so
now
she
got
no
answer
only
stupid
dear
i
be
better
in
the
cold
with
alarm
nan
crept
downstairs
and
hid
herself
in
arms
he
was
too
sleepy
to
give
the
matter
much
attention
odd
darling
never
understood
her
poor
old
ocky
the
intoxication
and
the
madness
were
gone
fear
had
come
any
moment
they
might
guess
with
fear
came
contrition
she
would
idolize
her
husband
more
till
he
became
for
her
the
man
he
was
not
next
morning
she
surprised
nan
by
announcing
that
she
was
homesick
for
ocky
that
her
things
were
packed
and
she
would
return
to
at
once
there
was
no
dissuading
her
in
her
heart
she
had
determined
to
wipe
out
her
faithlessness
by
educating
her
husband
into
largeness
by
love
when
the
train
had
moved
out
of
the
station
billy
stared
at
nan
puzzled
does
look
as
if
she
grown
fond
of
him
eh
what
nan
squeezed
his
arm
she
always
was
fond
of
him
and
we
were
may
be
now
she
it
because
he
got
money
make
a
difference
does
it
nan
pressed
against
him
and
looked
up
laughing
you
and
me
it
not
hidden
in
a
cab
he
caught
her
to
him
darling
she
held
him
from
her
blushing
why
now
what
this
for
makes
me
thankful
for
what
i
that
evening
a
man
moved
along
the
terrace
halted
as
though
he
were
minded
to
turn
back
moved
on
and
at
last
knocked
at
barrington
door
while
he
waited
he
mopped
his
forehead
his
manner
was
furtive
once
inside
the
hall
he
became
important
handing
his
card
with
a
flourish
left
alone
while
the
maid
announced
his
presence
he
fiddled
with
his
necktie
and
twisted
his
soaped
mustaches
barrington
burst
in
on
him
the
matter
old
man
you
know
that
jehane
went
home
this
morning
your
telegram
just
as
i
was
leaving
had
business
in
london
could
put
it
have
been
important
she
be
it
too
late
for
you
to
start
barrington
pulled
out
his
watch
stop
with
us
wo
you
had
dinner
all
right
let
go
out
nan
in
the
what
was
it
that
had
brought
him
barrington
kept
asking
himself
that
question
as
usual
ocky
was
voluble
and
plausible
but
his
high
spirits
were
forced
he
avoided
the
eye
when
watched
he
rattled
on
about
the
possibilities
of
sandport
he
talked
of
the
friends
he
had
made
men
whom
barrington
guessed
to
be
of
no
importance
he
repeated
his
friends
hilarious
stories
a
good
one
john
told
me
it
was
ocky
who
discovered
the
humor
in
the
story
and
laughed
trees
grew
more
dense
against
the
dark
lights
in
houses
were
extinguished
the
roar
of
london
like
a
voice
wearied
of
quarreling
which
mumbled
vexatiously
in
a
last
retort
sank
away
into
silence
but
this
tireless
voice
at
his
side
went
on
babbling
of
nothing
talking
and
talking
nan
rose
sleepy
you
excuse
me
wo
you
billy
darling
do
be
ocky
refilled
his
foul
pipe
with
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
he
felt
fortified
barrington
waited
for
him
to
reach
his
point
there
a
point
he
felt
sure
ocky
visits
always
had
an
ulterior
motive
all
right
at
madeira
lodge
the
land
investment
what
brought
you
ocky
was
as
shocked
as
if
a
gun
had
been
fired
in
his
face
the
question
was
unkind
he
tried
to
be
sociable
and
to
stave
off
unpleasantness
and
this
was
the
thanks
he
got
he
squirmed
uneasily
the
creaked
betraying
his
agitation
a
rotten
thing
to
say
to
a
fellow
billy
what
brought
me
indeed
it
was
barrington
turn
to
shift
in
his
chair
he
hated
to
be
called
billy
by
waffles
the
offence
was
repeated
confoundedly
direct
billy
whenever
i
visit
you
you
always
think
i
come
to
get
have
you
barrington
voice
was
hard
i
have
now
you
mention
a
pause
barrington
lost
patience
ca
you
get
it
out
like
a
man
done
something
while
jehane
been
away
something
that
made
you
afraid
to
meet
her
have
you
in
a
sense
it
her
doing
do
see
why
she
should
make
me
doing
in
what
way
ocky
struck
a
match
finding
his
pipe
empty
he
held
the
match
till
it
burnt
his
fingers
not
blaming
jehane
but
it
her
doing
up
to
a
point
she
wants
money
to
dress
her
girls
up
to
the
nines
she
wants
money
to
make
the
house
look
stylish
if
it
had
been
for
jehane
i
should
never
have
left
old
wagstaff
office
mind
i
not
blaming
her
but
where
was
the
money
to
come
from
let
her
believe
you
were
making
so
i
was
so
i
shall
if
i
can
only
get
you
get
the
money
she
already
had
her
money
that
i
invested
for
been
living
on
the
principal
is
that
it
on
the
money
that
should
have
gone
to
the
tension
proved
too
great
for
ocky
a
joke
might
relieve
the
situation
to
me
that
where
it
when
no
laugh
followed
he
hastened
to
add
pressure
of
course
i
then
want
you
to
lend
me
enough
to
tide
me
been
tiding
you
over
all
your
life
you
have
to
tell
her
when
you
told
her
i
see
what
i
can
do
once
for
the
first
time
that
evening
the
foolish
tone
of
banter
went
out
of
the
weak
man
voice
god
sake
do
make
me
do
that
you
do
know
what
a
punishment
you
inventing
know
what
that
do
to
her
kill
what
little
love
she
has
for
me
she
hate
me
she
despise
me
even
more
than
she
does
already
i
got
to
live
with
her
oh
my
god
barrington
drew
back
into
the
shadow
he
was
deeply
moved
and
ashamed
of
it
the
other
man
goaded
deeper
into
sincerity
by
his
silence
continued
pleading
brokenly
ca
understand
between
you
and
nan
it
always
been
different
you
strong
and
she
so
tender
but
i
i
weak
i
try
to
do
right
but
i
everlastingly
in
the
wrong
i
had
to
crawl
for
every
scrap
of
love
my
wife
ever
gave
me
she
thrown
it
at
me
like
a
bone
to
a
dog
i
a
poor
flimsy
devil
i
know
it
we
never
ought
to
have
married
she
too
splendid
but
she
all
i
got
i
thought
i
thought
if
i
could
take
her
money
and
double
it
she
respect
me
at
last
believe
me
clever
i
did
make
money
for
her
at
first
i
saw
what
a
difference
it
made
then
i
lost
i
was
afraid
to
tell
her
so
went
on
i
thought
i
win
if
i
tried
again
and
she
after
the
first
time
she
expected
the
extra
money
from
me
little
by
little
it
all
went
but
do
make
me
tell
it
was
lost
in
land
speculation
but
most
in
stocks
bought
on
margins
my
life
been
hell
for
the
past
six
months
do
make
me
tell
barrington
rose
late
i
let
you
know
you
must
give
me
a
complete
list
of
your
indebtedness
whatever
i
decide
i
think
you
ought
not
to
deceive
je
and
by
the
way
say
the
thing
you
mean
when
we
talk
of
this
say
instead
of
i
prefer
that
i
told
ocky
his
battle
was
won
one
night
sleep
placed
all
his
dread
behind
him
his
lack
of
permitted
him
to
recuperate
rapidly
early
in
the
morning
he
was
up
and
in
the
garden
whistling
cheerfully
as
though
he
had
suffered
no
humiliation
peter
heard
him
and
ran
to
greet
him
for
an
hour
before
breakfast
they
exchanged
secrets
and
peter
in
a
burst
of
confidence
initiated
his
uncle
into
the
mystery
of
the
loft
fine
place
to
hide
peter
you
never
told
anyone
before
you
told
me
well
what
know
about
that
you
must
be
somehow
fond
of
this
poor
old
peter
father
heard
them
laughing
and
was
annoyed
his
night
had
been
restless
he
was
still
more
irritated
when
on
entering
the
stable
he
found
ocky
with
his
arm
round
peter
shoulder
in
the
sunlight
he
saw
at
a
glance
how
his
cousin
had
deteriorated
his
gait
was
more
slouchy
his
expression
more
furtive
his
teeth
more
broken
with
constant
biting
on
the
pipe
his
attempts
at
smartness
the
soaped
mustaches
and
the
dusty
spats
were
wretchedly
offensive
they
were
so
ineffectually
pretentious
the
weak
man
hand
commenced
to
fumble
in
his
pocket
as
eyes
searched
him
my
baccy
must
have
dropped
it
seen
my
pouch
anywhere
peter
in
your
hand
peter
went
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
you
can
do
without
smoking
till
after
peter
laugh
stopped
cut
short
by
the
sternness
in
his
father
voice
in
his
study
an
hour
later
barrington
asked
sure
nothing
else
there
no
good
in
my
giving
you
anything
unless
you
make
a
clean
breast
to
me
and
mind
this
is
absolutely
the
last
time
i
save
you
from
this
moment
you
got
to
go
on
your
my
honor
billy
there
ocky
had
a
constitutional
weakness
for
lies
so
he
told
one
now
when
it
hindered
his
purpose
barrington
eyed
him
doubtfully
you
not
told
me
the
truth
jehane
shall
know
pledge
you
more
than
my
honor
the
check
was
signed
he
had
gained
a
new
lease
on
life
his
contrition
left
him
expelled
by
his
fatal
optimism
he
was
again
a
facetious
dog
whose
paltry
mistakes
lay
in
the
distant
past
at
parting
he
tipped
peter
a
pound
with
characteristic
careless
generosity
as
he
walked
down
the
terrace
he
tilted
his
hat
to
a
more
jaunty
angle
on
his
way
to
the
station
he
bought
some
flashy
jewelry
for
jehane
and
the
children
long
before
he
reached
he
had
so
far
risen
in
his
own
estimation
that
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
bold
financier
who
had
done
a
most
excellent
stroke
of
business
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
as
for
barrington
oh
he
always
been
narrowminded
the
money
was
a
loan
that
he
soon
pay
back
as
he
approached
madeira
lodge
jehane
was
watering
flowers
in
the
garden
he
hailed
her
from
a
distance
duchess
she
being
penitent
for
a
treachery
of
which
he
had
no
knowledge
restrained
her
disgust
at
the
detested
nickname
she
was
going
to
be
a
good
and
faithful
wife
she
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
the
had
scarcely
shut
behind
them
when
she
flung
her
arms
about
him
he
was
taken
by
surprise
was
lonely
without
you
ocky
that
why
i
came
lonely
for
me
why
why
not
know
sounds
odd
from
you
old
me
from
your
wife
did
you
feel
the
house
feel
it
empty
with
me
away
his
hands
clutched
at
her
shoulders
when
you
were
not
away
sometimes
old
gel
i
always
been
lonely
for
she
brought
her
face
down
to
his
me
close
ocky
close
as
doing
now
chapter
xvi
the
angels
and
ocky
waffles
ocky
was
like
the
houses
in
which
most
of
his
life
was
spent
the
angels
who
made
him
had
had
good
intentions
but
they
had
scamped
their
work
consequently
he
was
in
continual
need
of
repair
illustration
if
someone
had
had
time
to
spend
a
lot
of
love
about
him
his
defects
could
have
been
patched
up
so
as
to
be
scarcely
noticeable
as
it
was
people
only
came
to
his
help
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
tumbling
down
they
shored
him
up
hurriedly
and
left
him
but
no
one
cared
enough
to
give
him
new
foundations
the
right
kind
of
woman
could
have
rebuilt
him
throughout
the
kind
of
woman
who
knows
how
to
love
a
man
for
his
faults
as
well
as
for
his
virtues
but
few
women
are
architects
where
their
husbands
are
concerned
only
those
who
marry
to
give
more
than
they
get
nan
could
have
done
it
but
she
was
married
to
barrington
glory
could
have
done
it
but
she
was
only
a
little
so
the
angels
had
to
watch
their
good
intentions
crumble
ocky
knew
quite
well
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
required
a
wife
who
would
sit
on
his
knee
and
ruffle
his
hair
and
call
him
the
funniest
old
dear
in
the
world
such
a
wife
he
would
have
had
to
carry
through
life
her
dependence
would
have
educated
his
strength
a
wife
who
was
censorious
made
him
weakly
obstinate
and
foolishly
daring
if
he
had
been
patted
and
hugged
he
would
have
been
a
good
man
his
mother
had
done
that
but
jehane
ah
well
she
did
her
best
barrington
when
he
signed
the
check
had
made
ocky
promise
to
return
to
jehane
the
thousand
pounds
she
had
lent
it
was
her
thousand
pounds
but
glory
held
in
trust
for
her
till
she
married
ocky
had
pledged
his
word
to
give
it
back
on
one
condition
that
jehane
was
to
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
transaction
at
the
time
he
had
quite
intended
to
carry
out
the
agreement
but
so
much
can
be
done
with
a
thousand
pounds
and
an
ingenious
mind
can
invent
so
many
excuses
for
dishonesty
the
morning
after
his
he
hung
about
the
house
instead
of
going
to
his
office
already
his
methods
of
holding
her
closely
were
getting
on
jehane
nerves
his
shiftless
easy
affection
tried
her
patience
beyond
endurance
you
going
yet
old
gel
i
want
to
have
a
good
look
at
you
think
you
ought
to
go
you
have
all
your
life
to
look
at
me
and
i
got
my
work
if
you
right
old
wish
you
would
gel
me
so
much
it
vulgar
and
lighting
his
pipe
he
strolled
into
the
hall
and
picked
up
his
hat
he
stood
there
fumbling
with
it
only
when
she
followed
him
did
he
set
it
on
his
head
retreating
toward
the
door
with
the
street
at
his
back
he
turned
say
about
your
goodness
sake
go
we
can
talk
about
that
at
he
glanced
across
his
shoulder
at
the
sunlit
street
his
flight
would
be
unimpeded
lose
your
wool
old
i
mean
jehane
i
something
to
tell
you
had
a
nice
little
stroke
o
luck
made
thirty
pounds
for
the
flame
of
hostility
sank
at
the
mention
of
money
they
stood
gazing
at
one
another
each
was
aware
that
within
twelve
hours
of
peace
being
declared
the
old
feud
had
all
but
broken
out
jehane
was
frightened
by
the
knowledge
and
at
her
lapse
into
temper
ocky
was
congratulating
himself
on
the
dexterous
lie
with
which
the
crash
had
been
averted
pounds
and
you
kept
it
so
quiet
he
twirled
his
mustaches
fiercely
straddling
the
doormat
all
boldness
and
bullying
now
little
boy
may
be
vulgar
sometimes
but
he
is
silly
far
from
how
did
you
do
it
she
leant
against
him
with
both
her
hands
on
his
arm
trying
to
make
his
eyes
meet
hers
would
understand
watched
the
market
yer
know
sold
out
just
in
time
last
moment
in
clever
that
what
i
kept
telling
billy
and
so
i
sometimes
thought
so
he
held
his
face
away
from
hers
as
she
pushed
to
the
door
and
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
yet
you
were
treating
me
like
a
fool
just
now
you
too
ready
at
calling
me
silly
and
vulgar
i
get
tired
of
as
he
spoke
he
had
in
mind
the
firm
way
in
which
a
masterful
person
like
barrington
would
act
got
to
stop
it
jehane
it
the
last
time
i
mention
know
i
unfair
unfair
to
you
to
myself
to
all
of
us
oh
ocky
be
patient
with
me
i
do
so
want
to
be
she
hid
her
face
against
his
shoulder
in
contrition
and
unhappiness
ocky
was
a
generous
enemy
he
found
it
easy
to
forgive
being
a
sinner
himself
there
that
awright
duchess
do
cry
about
it
but
i
brought
this
matter
up
i
think
you
ought
to
have
your
money
she
stared
at
him
in
surprise
to
why
what
mean
is
it
a
punishment
i
do
he
set
his
hat
far
back
on
his
forehead
not
trying
to
hurt
your
feelin
but
you
do
trust
me
never
have
it
anxious
work
handling
the
money
of
a
woman
who
do
trust
you
if
i
were
to
make
a
mistake
you
give
me
hell
i
mean
the
warmest
time
i
ever
had
i
rather
much
rather
you
took
your
money
he
was
drifting
away
from
her
already
she
had
pushed
him
from
her
something
must
be
done
you
who
do
trust
me
if
you
think
her
tones
quivered
with
reproach
as
she
said
it
you
want
me
to
go
on
investing
for
you
sure
of
it
sure
of
always
remember
i
tried
to
make
you
take
it
back
and
you
would
is
that
so
i
i
do
my
best
but
i
do
it
under
protest
do
ocky
everything
that
we
have
we
he
kissed
her
and
passed
out
into
the
street
with
alacrity
she
might
get
to
considering
his
motives
but
at
the
garden
gate
he
hesitated
dawdled
and
came
back
here
i
do
want
barrington
nosing
into
my
affairs
if
i
do
this
for
you
it
between
should
think
of
telling
if
you
breathe
a
word
to
nan
i
stop
dead
and
you
can
manage
your
investments
so
he
kept
to
the
letter
of
his
agreement
with
barrington
and
he
kept
to
jehane
capital
and
he
accomplished
this
by
that
small
lie
about
the
thirty
pounds
when
playfair
had
chosen
ocky
waffles
to
be
of
the
sandport
real
estate
concern
he
had
shown
remarkable
cunning
he
was
tricky
himself
and
he
required
a
subordinate
who
was
no
more
scrupulous
yet
a
subordinate
who
could
give
to
smart
transactions
an
appearance
of
honesty
playfair
finances
were
scanty
in
order
to
extend
his
credit
it
was
necessary
to
pose
in
the
eyes
of
sandport
as
a
civic
benefactor
outside
investors
were
attracted
by
a
not
too
truthful
but
undoubtedly
clever
series
of
advertisements
for
which
ocky
was
responsible
such
as
built
on
sand
we
all
remember
the
bible
parable
of
the
foolish
man
who
built
his
house
upon
sand
when
the
winds
blew
and
the
floods
came
it
fell
houses
built
at
sandport
are
the
exception
we
have
a
lower
death
rate
here
etc
our
houses
this
was
all
very
well
but
several
important
facts
were
omitted
from
the
advertisements
that
a
number
of
the
land
lots
offered
for
sale
were
too
inaccessible
to
be
of
practical
value
and
that
those
marked
as
which
connected
them
up
with
the
town
were
actually
still
on
the
market
and
again
that
many
of
the
immediate
and
promised
developments
which
would
increase
the
value
of
the
property
would
be
indefinitely
postponed
by
lack
of
capital
and
again
that
in
certain
cases
building
would
be
impossible
by
reason
of
springs
which
undermined
the
sand
in
the
promotion
of
a
shaky
enterprise
ocky
was
in
his
element
he
could
not
have
brought
the
same
cleverness
to
bear
on
an
honest
transaction
the
school
of
life
from
which
he
had
graduated
was
one
of
shifts
evasions
and
shams
even
his
experiences
with
jehane
kept
his
hand
expert
he
was
so
plausible
in
his
gilding
of
falsity
that
he
made
it
appear
like
the
truth
itself
but
if
playfair
in
selecting
ocky
had
shown
his
cunning
he
had
also
shown
his
lack
of
business
shrewdness
for
ocky
was
not
the
person
to
trust
with
money
and
he
had
to
trust
him
so
that
he
might
make
him
the
if
any
infringment
of
the
law
should
be
found
out
some
of
the
money
which
barrington
had
given
ocky
had
gone
toward
the
straightening
of
the
sandport
real
estate
concern
accounts
before
playfair
should
discover
that
they
had
been
juggled
ocky
had
not
meant
to
steal
he
never
meant
to
do
anything
improper
he
borrowed
the
money
to
support
his
private
speculations
while
jehane
affection
could
only
be
purchased
he
was
continually
tempted
to
borrow
he
fully
intended
to
pay
back
he
always
fully
intended
the
angels
made
three
desperate
efforts
to
prevent
ocky
from
crumbling
they
gave
him
glory
a
curious
sympathy
had
grown
up
between
him
and
the
child
of
jehane
first
marriage
perhaps
it
was
that
they
both
suffered
from
the
unevenness
of
jehane
temper
at
any
rate
he
much
preferred
her
to
his
own
little
daughter
riska
though
she
was
only
seven
had
learnt
to
be
both
vain
and
selfish
at
the
same
time
when
there
was
anything
she
wanted
she
knew
how
to
be
attractive
she
was
her
mother
favorite
and
belonged
to
her
mother
camp
and
madeira
lodge
tended
to
become
more
and
more
divided
into
two
silently
hostile
parties
ocky
had
the
unpleasant
feeling
that
riska
was
amused
by
the
outbreaks
which
occurred
and
turned
them
to
her
own
profit
whereas
glory
already
at
ten
glory
was
a
woman
in
her
forethought
for
him
she
would
follow
after
him
hanging
up
his
coat
and
hat
rectifying
his
habitual
untidiness
and
stamping
out
the
sparks
which
were
so
often
the
beginnings
of
domestic
conflagrations
her
gray
eyes
were
always
kind
when
they
looked
at
him
and
she
was
never
impatient
under
his
caresses
little
father
she
would
whisper
putting
her
soft
arms
about
him
sure
mother
did
mean
to
say
and
the
angels
gave
him
his
mary
they
called
her
which
was
contracted
to
moggs
as
she
grew
older
but
riska
called
her
the
which
stood
for
ma
left
over
because
she
was
so
small
that
it
seemed
as
though
jehane
had
run
short
of
material
when
she
made
her
ocky
was
very
glad
of
moggs
moggs
was
too
young
to
judge
him
even
eustace
judged
him
saying
been
naughty
daddy
mumma
vewy
there
was
no
pity
in
the
little
boy
tone
when
he
said
it
only
sorrowful
accusation
sitting
by
moggs
cradle
ocky
would
wonder
whether
the
day
would
come
when
she
learning
what
a
fool
she
had
for
a
father
would
turn
against
him
in
the
midst
of
his
wondering
she
would
wake
and
he
would
see
two
blue
glimpses
of
heaven
laughing
up
at
him
he
would
take
her
in
his
arms
promising
her
because
she
could
not
understand
a
word
he
said
that
for
her
sake
he
would
try
not
to
take
so
much
as
a
means
to
bolstering
up
his
courage
was
a
habit
which
grew
upon
him
peter
who
was
the
third
effort
of
the
angels
noticed
a
change
every
time
he
visited
uncle
waffles
on
those
walks
across
the
lonely
uncle
waffles
no
longer
pretended
that
he
drank
the
for
his
health
a
marvel
peter
that
what
you
are
you
get
me
to
tell
you
everything
it
i
have
to
tell
somebody
and
i
know
you
wo
split
on
me
now
about
this
i
taking
more
and
more
of
it
and
why
because
it
my
only
way
of
being
happy
before
i
married
the
duchess
i
hardly
ever
touched
it
i
had
my
mother
then
i
wish
you
known
her
peter
she
was
a
rare
one
for
laughing
i
only
feel
like
laughing
now
when
i
taken
more
than
good
for
me
not
that
i
was
ever
drunk
in
my
life
it
never
goes
to
my
head
only
he
had
usually
had
too
much
when
he
made
these
confessions
peter
knew
he
had
by
the
way
in
which
he
said
got
a
nacherly
strong
stomick
it
a
gif
from
god
i
peter
kept
these
disclosures
to
himself
and
walked
his
uncle
about
till
it
was
safe
to
return
to
madeira
lodge
ocky
would
retire
as
soon
as
they
entered
saying
that
he
had
a
bad
headache
they
became
of
such
frequent
occurrence
that
jehane
began
to
be
suspicious
during
the
next
three
years
ocky
visits
to
topbury
were
periodic
barrington
could
usually
calculate
his
advent
to
a
nicety
one
night
there
would
be
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
waffles
would
enter
unheralded
while
others
were
present
he
would
joke
with
his
old
abandon
as
though
he
had
a
care
in
the
world
then
barrington
would
turn
to
him
we
go
upstairs
to
my
study
for
a
chat
the
fiction
was
kept
up
that
ocky
visits
were
of
a
friendly
and
family
nature
the
constant
fear
at
topbury
was
that
the
servants
might
guess
and
the
scandal
would
leak
out
when
the
study
door
had
shut
behind
them
barrington
would
give
vent
to
his
indignation
much
this
time
had
hard
mean
you
want
me
to
clear
off
your
debts
and
pay
back
the
money
you
taken
wo
happen
again
billy
just
this
said
that
last
time
and
the
time
before
that
and
every
time
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
remember
what
i
said
before
the
anger
in
barrington
eyes
ocky
began
to
crouch
happen
again
i
swear
it
i
learnt
my
barrington
knew
his
answers
before
they
were
uttered
told
you
each
time
he
said
if
you
repeated
your
thefts
you
have
to
take
the
consequences
last
time
i
meant
then
would
follow
from
ocky
a
series
of
pleadings
and
arguments
that
exposure
would
entail
disgrace
all
round
that
he
would
be
arrested
that
his
family
would
be
ruined
that
the
story
would
get
into
the
papers
and
would
reflect
discreditably
on
barrington
when
these
failed
ocky
would
appeal
to
their
friendship
and
the
common
memories
they
shared
the
scene
would
usually
close
with
a
warning
from
barrington
that
this
was
really
the
last
time
he
would
come
to
his
rescue
then
the
debts
would
be
added
up
and
the
check
book
would
be
brought
out
the
threat
of
ocky
became
a
nightmare
to
barrington
and
nan
the
children
were
not
supposed
to
know
about
it
the
finding
of
so
much
money
was
an
intolerable
burden
and
they
were
never
safe
from
its
recurrence
on
several
occasions
barrington
had
to
sell
some
of
his
pictures
to
meet
these
sudden
demands
for
ready
cash
to
add
to
their
anxiety
was
the
fact
that
they
had
so
far
refrained
from
telling
jehane
out
of
fear
that
her
resentment
against
her
husband
would
make
matters
worse
so
her
letters
still
arrived
punctually
singing
his
praises
and
saying
how
splendidly
he
was
making
progress
but
the
day
was
fast
approaching
when
the
shoring
up
of
ocky
waffles
had
to
end
it
ended
when
barrington
discovered
that
his
cousin
was
tapping
other
sources
for
his
borrowing
on
a
trip
to
oxford
with
reference
to
a
manuscript
he
surprised
ocky
leaving
the
professor
house
nan
when
calling
on
the
misses
jacobite
recognized
an
envelope
addressed
in
ocky
hand
the
next
time
he
made
his
visit
to
topbury
barrington
kept
his
promise
ocky
was
shown
directly
into
the
study
without
any
preliminaries
of
family
enquiries
he
was
not
asked
to
sit
down
barrington
faced
him
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
been
expecting
you
my
mind
made
up
i
do
want
to
hear
what
you
come
for
or
any
of
your
excuses
you
lied
to
me
i
know
all
about
the
professor
and
the
misses
jacobite
doubtless
there
are
others
you
can
go
to
jail
this
time
and
i
hope
it
cure
you
i
been
a
fool
to
try
and
save
you
you
rotten
since
the
accidental
meeting
at
oxford
ocky
had
been
prepared
for
some
such
explosion
he
had
fortified
himself
with
drink
for
the
encounter
but
he
was
stunned
by
this
unexpected
air
of
judicial
finality
he
began
to
pour
out
feverish
words
barrington
cut
him
short
three
years
you
poisoned
my
life
you
blackmailed
me
with
the
fear
that
your
disgrace
would
be
made
known
you
yourself
have
made
that
fear
certain
by
applying
to
my
friends
the
scandal
can
become
public
as
soon
as
it
likes
that
all
i
have
to
say
the
game
was
up
ocky
straightened
himself
to
meet
the
blow
he
ceased
to
be
cringing
and
humble
the
drink
helped
him
to
be
bold
so
did
his
desperate
sense
of
the
world
injustice
say
i
rotten
throughout
perhaps
i
am
but
who
made
me
like
that
i
was
rotten
when
we
were
boys
together
and
i
was
rotten
when
my
mother
was
with
me
who
made
me
rotten
you
and
clever
people
like
you
you
never
let
me
forget
that
i
was
clever
never
did
anything
but
humiliate
me
by
reminding
me
that
i
was
on
a
lower
level
your
gifts
were
always
bitter
because
they
were
given
without
kindness
to
get
rid
of
me
or
in
and
in
return
i
was
expected
to
admire
you
oh
you
hard
good
man
you
could
make
me
clever
just
by
saying
to
me
clever
or
good
just
by
saying
good
you
say
i
lied
to
you
of
course
i
lied
lied
as
a
child
will
to
escape
punishment
you
never
understood
me
even
before
i
went
crooked
you
were
ashamed
of
me
because
i
had
the
brains
to
think
your
thoughts
and
to
speak
your
language
your
intellect
despised
me
yes
and
you
taught
my
wife
to
despise
me
did
you
call
me
an
before
company
on
the
very
night
i
became
engaged
to
her
she
remembered
that
and
took
her
tone
from
you
you
were
her
standard
from
the
first
she
was
discontented
with
me
because
i
was
you
and
could
give
her
the
home
you
given
nan
so
i
tried
to
be
rich
because
to
be
rich
is
to
be
clever
i
gambled
with
what
did
belong
to
me
to
get
money
to
buy
my
wife
respect
and
now
because
you
were
always
there
setting
the
pace
for
me
with
your
success
i
lost
everything
but
if
i
won
by
my
you
and
jehane
would
have
been
the
first
to
say
that
i
was
a
clever
chap
i
was
born
bad
what
you
and
my
wife
have
thought
about
me
has
made
me
what
i
am
damn
you
i
touch
a
farthing
of
your
charity
now
i
want
to
go
to
the
dogs
where
both
of
you
sent
me
and
to
make
as
big
a
scandal
as
i
he
was
trembling
with
hysteric
anger
his
voice
was
thick
and
hoarse
with
passion
his
weak
and
genial
features
were
absurdly
in
contrast
with
the
violence
of
what
he
said
his
soaped
mustaches
and
white
spats
made
him
a
comic
figure
at
any
time
but
doubly
comic
in
the
rôle
of
an
accusing
prophet
barrington
eyed
him
quietly
without
the
quiver
of
a
muscle
or
the
flicker
of
a
lash
he
had
hardened
his
heart
beforehand
against
the
appeal
of
such
a
theatric
outburst
that
all
ocky
hung
his
head
the
fire
of
his
was
quenched
by
the
restrained
ridicule
of
the
man
who
addressed
him
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
eyes
with
his
tired
hands
as
he
was
passing
into
the
hall
peter
looked
over
the
banisters
and
saw
him
kay
here
dear
old
uncle
he
called
and
commenced
running
down
the
stairs
at
the
landing
his
father
stopped
him
my
peter
laughed
and
tried
to
wriggle
past
him
but
his
father
held
him
firmly
saying
meant
what
i
looking
down
peter
saw
the
face
of
his
friend
glance
back
at
him
it
was
lined
and
tortured
then
the
front
door
closed
with
a
bang
barrington
his
study
now
that
he
had
accomplished
the
difficult
cruelty
his
mind
was
in
doubt
if
peter
loved
ocky
there
must
be
some
good
left
in
him
but
he
had
used
that
argument
with
himself
before
as
he
sat
pictures
began
to
form
of
ocky
as
he
had
been
he
saw
him
about
peter
age
the
weakly
schoolboy
whose
battles
he
had
had
to
fight
because
he
was
strong
he
recalled
that
term
when
he
had
had
to
take
him
to
the
doctor
with
his
poisoned
hand
he
remembered
how
ocky
mother
had
always
said
of
him
that
he
was
the
most
careful
and
dearest
son
in
the
world
no
he
had
been
always
bad
his
thoughts
became
unbearable
he
needed
approval
for
his
act
stepping
out
on
to
the
landing
he
called
when
she
came
he
was
again
seated
in
his
chair
the
lights
were
out
and
a
log
of
ship
wood
spluttering
on
the
coals
burnt
violet
and
yellow
making
the
shadows
wag
accusing
fingers
she
curled
herself
up
on
the
floor
leaning
her
head
against
his
knees
like
a
small
child
at
the
story
hour
before
it
goes
to
bed
nan
always
brought
an
atmosphere
of
kindness
with
her
of
innocence
and
goodness
her
ways
were
those
of
a
young
girl
who
walks
on
tiptoe
with
hands
upon
her
breast
listening
for
life
to
call
her
barrington
watched
her
shining
head
and
how
the
fire
glinted
against
the
column
of
her
throat
if
ocky
had
had
a
wife
like
nan
it
was
some
time
before
she
spoke
then
had
to
be
a
brute
and
i
hate
myself
i
kicked
him
you
think
you
did
right
i
did
i
should
have
done
it
the
thing
had
to
what
next
got
to
think
of
jehane
and
her
children
i
wondering
how
much
she
knows
or
never
tell
i
wonder
will
she
stand
by
him
there
was
silence
barrington
spoke
hinted
at
something
it
might
be
true
something
that
i
never
thought
about
it
explains
those
letters
of
jehane
it
explains
why
they
never
got
on
together
i
always
said
that
a
little
love
would
have
made
ocky
a
better
what
was
it
dates
a
long
way
back
he
said
that
jehane
had
made
our
home
and
my
love
for
you
the
standard
of
what
she
expected
from
understand
and
it
true
billy
she
wanted
a
man
like
you
from
the
silence
nan
said
she
used
to
talk
about
the
penal
servitude
of
now
said
barrington
have
to
learn
about
the
penal
servitude
of
marriage
whatever
happens
unless
he
her
be
her
husband
to
the
but
ca
we
stop
this
dreadful
something
barrington
stooped
and
took
her
hand
woman
we
been
trying
to
stop
it
all
these
years
we
stop
it
we
can
only
postpone
it
and
give
him
more
time
to
drag
jehane
and
the
children
lower
down
we
reached
the
point
where
things
have
got
to
be
at
their
worst
before
they
can
grow
better
it
a
question
now
of
how
many
of
them
we
can
rescue
ocky
has
to
be
allowed
to
sink
for
the
sake
of
the
nan
forehead
puckered
at
the
cruelty
of
such
logic
i
understand
it
seems
so
horrible
that
we
should
sit
here
with
a
fire
burning
and
everything
comfortable
saying
things
like
is
horrible
it
so
horrible
that
if
i
were
to
give
him
everything
i
have
he
still
go
to
the
devil
he
a
drowning
man
and
he
drag
down
everyone
who
tries
to
drag
him
she
clung
to
her
husband
aghast
at
this
painful
glimpse
of
reality
i
still
do
understand
why
why
should
he
be
like
that
he
kind
and
he
gentle
and
he
makes
children
love
want
to
know
and
you
wo
be
hurt
if
i
say
something
very
terrible
do
mind
being
hurt
i
that
think
it
because
of
jehane
because
of
what
she
left
undone
she
never
brought
any
song
to
her
marriage
never
made
any
joy
for
him
or
because
of
that
he
to
because
of
that
he
to
be
allowed
to
go
under
it
chivalry
not
justice
at
sea
one
saves
the
women
and
children
first
he
a
in
quick
revulsion
from
this
ugliness
of
other
people
sordidness
he
bent
over
her
brushing
his
lips
against
her
cheek
and
hair
i
ever
grow
tired
of
kissing
you
i
wonder
my
own
little
nan
and
so
in
one
another
arms
for
a
moment
they
shut
out
the
memory
of
tragedy
but
the
angels
had
not
done
with
ocky
waffles
yet
chapter
xvii
a
house
built
on
sand
there
was
one
more
letter
from
jehane
she
wrote
that
ocky
had
just
returned
from
london
where
he
had
been
on
important
business
she
understood
that
he
had
been
too
hurried
to
be
able
to
visit
topbury
he
was
working
very
hard
too
hard
for
his
health
he
was
overambitious
while
she
was
writing
he
had
come
in
to
tell
her
that
he
was
off
again
to
london
then
followed
domestic
chatter
how
glory
was
taking
so
that
she
might
play
to
her
father
when
she
grew
older
and
how
eustace
had
a
new
tricycle
and
how
riska
already
had
an
eye
for
the
boys
this
was
the
last
letter
very
foolish
and
very
brave
then
silence
and
suspense
the
days
dragged
by
nights
stayed
long
and
the
sun
rose
late
in
the
mornings
the
fields
which
lay
in
front
of
the
terrace
were
blanketed
in
sulphurous
mist
through
which
bare
trees
loomed
spectral
railings
and
walls
and
pavements
were
damp
as
though
fear
had
caused
them
to
sweat
all
night
nan
and
barrington
lying
side
by
side
feigned
sleep
or
slept
restlessly
both
were
afraid
to
voice
their
dread
lest
when
spoken
it
should
seem
more
actual
once
when
a
hansom
jingled
out
of
the
distance
and
halted
outside
their
house
they
started
up
together
listening
the
fare
alighted
and
walked
a
few
doors
down
again
they
drew
breath
nan
little
lady
did
i
wake
you
i
was
awake
i
thought
i
thought
it
was
i
who
had
made
you
not
slept
a
wink
since
i
lay
have
as
he
clasped
her
in
the
dark
he
could
feel
her
trembling
he
held
her
tightly
to
him
laying
his
face
against
hers
on
the
pillow
again
they
both
were
listening
makes
you
so
frightened
he
whispered
the
question
thinking
always
thinking
of
the
future
and
what
may
she
commenced
to
sob
pressing
her
forehead
against
his
breast
he
tried
to
soothe
her
must
pepperminta
you
must
really
it
hurts
i
think
for
you
i
always
have
now
close
your
eyes
and
get
some
and
she
closed
her
eyes
and
lay
very
tense
hours
and
hours
later
london
began
to
growl
presently
the
door
of
the
servants
bedroom
opened
the
stairs
creaked
the
house
was
filled
with
stealthy
sounds
at
last
she
drowsed
when
her
husband
had
tiptoed
out
to
his
bath
she
rose
hastily
and
commenced
to
dress
she
must
get
down
before
him
he
must
be
spared
if
the
message
was
there
she
must
read
it
first
the
was
in
dusk
these
november
mornings
at
the
end
of
the
room
the
fire
burnt
red
and
before
it
kay
and
peter
warmed
their
hands
not
until
she
had
run
through
the
letters
did
she
greet
them
then
for
their
sakes
she
tried
to
appear
cheerful
barrington
on
entering
cast
one
swift
look
in
her
direction
and
realized
that
the
end
was
not
yet
absentmindedly
they
took
their
places
at
the
table
scarcely
thankful
for
this
respite
from
certainty
the
children
soon
apprehended
that
all
was
not
well
their
high
clear
voices
were
hushed
they
spoke
in
whispers
peter
was
fourteen
he
had
guessed
the
meaning
of
blank
spaces
on
the
walls
from
which
some
of
the
favorite
pictures
had
vanished
the
dutch
landscape
by
cuyp
was
still
there
above
the
blue
couch
against
the
background
of
dark
across
its
glass
the
flickering
reflection
of
the
fire
danced
lighting
up
the
placid
burgher
as
he
walked
with
his
ladies
on
the
bank
of
the
gray
canal
peter
noticed
how
his
father
eyes
rested
on
it
a
sure
sign
that
he
was
troubled
almost
by
stealth
peter
would
push
back
his
chair
and
nudge
his
sister
miss
effie
jacobite
gave
her
lessons
in
the
mornings
on
his
way
to
school
he
had
to
leave
kay
at
her
house
shouldering
his
satchel
he
would
lead
her
out
into
the
misty
streets
then
at
last
he
would
dare
to
raise
his
voice
in
laughter
at
the
departure
of
the
children
barrington
would
break
off
from
the
train
of
thought
he
had
been
following
and
was
incessantly
following
he
done
right
by
ocky
the
door
would
bang
through
the
long
dark
day
nan
would
sit
alone
and
speculate
and
wonder
what
was
happening
had
the
smash
been
postponed
had
ocky
wriggled
round
the
corner
by
borrowing
secretly
from
other
people
friends
billy
searched
the
faces
of
his
business
acquaintances
and
nan
the
faces
of
their
topbury
circle
in
an
effort
to
make
them
tell
toward
afternoon
the
fog
would
roll
up
from
the
city
dense
and
yellow
footsteps
on
the
terrace
would
come
suddenly
out
of
nowhere
their
makers
were
shadows
nan
rising
uneasily
would
go
to
the
window
they
might
be
footsteps
of
pursuers
or
of
bringers
of
bad
tidings
even
grace
policeman
filled
her
with
panic
when
he
paused
for
an
instant
outside
the
house
his
tread
was
the
tread
of
justice
ponderous
and
unescapable
with
the
return
of
the
children
her
oppression
lifted
later
billy
key
would
grate
in
the
latch
she
was
in
the
hall
to
meet
him
before
he
had
crossed
the
threshold
news
the
servants
must
not
hear
her
she
spoke
beneath
her
breath
nothing
the
children
no
longer
called
to
one
another
as
they
went
about
their
play
they
tiptoed
and
looked
up
anxiously
when
addressed
no
urging
was
necessary
to
send
them
to
bed
bed
was
escape
to
a
less
ominous
world
muffled
muffled
everything
was
cloaked
and
muffled
as
peter
put
two
and
two
together
pain
grew
into
his
eyes
even
when
others
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
expression
in
his
eyes
was
judging
only
romance
was
unaffected
by
the
sense
of
foreboding
the
servants
felt
it
and
discussed
it
in
the
kitchen
wondering
whether
the
master
was
losing
money
but
romance
with
went
on
bearing
kittens
and
so
did
her
daughter
sir
walter
scott
who
came
by
her
name
through
an
accident
regarding
her
sex
a
month
had
gone
by
i
write
to
jehane
she
asked
her
husband
would
if
you
do
we
shall
have
ocky
back
on
our
hands
perhaps
he
may
pull
things
together
now
that
he
knows
that
he
stands
by
himself
if
he
does
it
make
a
man
of
him
anyhow
if
she
finds
out
and
needs
our
help
she
send
for
but
the
silence
proved
too
much
for
nan
one
morning
on
the
spur
of
the
impulse
she
packed
a
bag
left
a
note
for
her
husband
and
set
off
for
sandport
on
the
journey
through
sodden
country
and
towns
she
fought
for
courage
straining
out
into
eternity
to
pluck
the
hem
of
god
mantle
which
when
her
faith
had
touched
was
continually
withdrawn
beyond
reach
of
her
hand
she
had
rung
the
bell
and
stood
waiting
on
the
steps
of
madeira
lodge
no
one
answered
she
thought
she
heard
the
of
feet
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
she
rang
again
and
took
a
pace
back
to
glance
up
at
the
front
of
the
house
as
she
did
so
she
saw
a
curtain
move
before
a
window
move
almost
imperceptibly
a
minute
later
the
door
was
flung
open
by
jehane
nan
saw
the
children
grouped
behind
her
in
the
passage
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
flat
and
unfriendly
thought
i
come
and
see
you
janey
only
made
up
my
mind
this
you
what
made
you
do
that
nan
flushed
and
her
voice
faltered
she
had
not
expected
this
hardness
and
defiance
she
had
come
full
of
pity
came
because
i
was
nervous
you
had
written
for
more
than
a
month
i
hope
i
hope
inside
said
jehane
ca
talk
to
you
out
there
you
can
stop
your
once
inside
the
appearance
of
the
house
told
its
story
it
looked
bare
from
the
sideboard
the
silver
mostly
presents
of
jehane
first
marriage
had
vanished
the
walls
were
stripped
of
all
ornaments
which
had
a
negotiable
value
in
the
there
was
an
empty
space
where
there
had
once
been
a
piano
only
the
carefully
curtained
windows
kept
up
the
pretence
of
trim
prosperity
jehane
led
nan
from
room
to
room
without
a
word
and
the
children
shuffling
behind
followed
you
seen
for
yourself
she
said
a
nice
fool
you
must
think
me
after
my
letters
i
lied
for
him
and
sold
my
jewelry
for
him
i
done
without
servants
i
crept
out
at
night
like
a
thief
to
the
pawnbrokers
when
there
was
any
money
and
there
were
debts
to
be
settled
and
the
last
thing
i
heard
before
he
left
was
that
he
stolen
the
thousand
pounds
i
lent
him
and
this
this
is
what
i
he
left
month
ago
after
my
last
letter
to
you
you
need
pretend
to
be
surprised
because
you
not
you
suspected
that
what
brought
nan
felt
faint
with
the
shock
of
the
realization
she
tottered
and
stretched
out
her
hands
to
save
herself
glory
ran
forward
and
put
her
arm
round
her
nan
drew
glory
head
against
her
shoulder
sobbing
my
dear
my
poor
little
girl
jehane
looked
on
unmoved
merely
saying
in
her
hard
flat
voice
there
any
crying
or
fainting
to
be
done
seems
to
me
i
the
person
to
do
it
but
i
past
all
nan
quieted
herself
so
shocked
me
i
i
did
mean
to
make
a
fuss
but
wo
you
tell
me
how
it
all
happened
to
tell
it
just
ocky
with
his
lies
and
do
say
that
before
the
children
about
their
say
what
i
like
they
my
children
they
seen
nan
looked
round
and
saw
sympathy
only
in
the
eyes
of
glory
moggs
balancing
herself
by
her
mother
skirts
piped
up
and
spoke
for
the
rest
a
naughty
even
her
mother
was
startled
by
the
candor
of
this
endorsement
turning
sharply
she
caused
moggs
to
tumble
on
the
floor
with
a
bump
moggs
began
to
yell
grateful
for
a
diversion
in
any
form
nan
knelt
and
comforted
the
little
girl
jehane
watched
her
indifferently
as
though
all
capacity
for
kindness
had
left
her
when
peace
was
restored
nan
said
coming
home
with
me
all
of
not
husband
may
return
if
he
does
i
must
stay
here
and
keep
up
appearances
till
he
gets
safely
out
of
the
country
heaven
knows
what
he
done
and
it
likely
that
i
come
to
topbury
to
be
laughed
at
may
want
me
but
what
about
billy
you
both
known
this
for
a
month
and
you
could
even
send
me
a
line
come
to
topbury
no
thank
you
there
was
so
much
to
be
explained
and
explanations
were
so
tangled
nan
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
a
clean
breast
when
she
told
jehane
of
the
years
of
borrowing
that
had
been
going
on
behind
her
back
she
was
justifiably
angry
you
knew
all
the
time
and
for
three
years
it
was
practically
you
and
billy
who
were
running
this
house
and
you
kept
me
in
ignorance
i
must
say
you
a
queer
way
of
showing
friendship
did
it
because
because
we
were
afraid
if
you
knew
you
love
him
and
then
matters
would
have
been
him
i
not
loved
him
since
we
married
he
started
playing
the
fool
directly
after
the
wedding
before
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
i
knew
then
that
i
have
to
be
ashamed
of
him
always
i
knew
what
i
done
for
myself
he
killed
my
love
within
an
hour
of
making
me
his
wife
but
how
you
must
have
amused
yourselves
knowing
what
you
did
when
you
received
my
letters
about
his
getting
on
in
the
world
progress
my
god
how
you
must
have
laughed
the
two
of
you
every
time
he
gave
me
a
present
it
was
your
all
this
before
the
children
she
threw
herself
down
on
a
couch
and
gave
way
to
hysterics
wrenched
with
sobs
screaming
with
unhappy
merriment
clutching
at
her
breast
and
throwing
back
her
head
the
children
began
to
cry
hiding
in
corners
of
the
room
terrified
only
glory
kept
her
nerve
and
following
directions
fetched
water
to
bathe
her
mother
face
and
hands
when
the
insane
laughter
had
spent
itself
jehane
lay
still
with
eyes
closed
panting
shame
took
the
place
of
harshness
nan
asked
whether
there
were
any
stimulants
in
the
house
when
a
bottle
was
brought
from
the
cupboard
jehane
gesticulated
it
away
with
disgust
could
touch
it
it
it
was
all
that
was
left
of
his
nan
persuaded
glory
to
take
the
children
out
of
the
room
she
seated
herself
by
the
couch
in
silence
stroking
jehane
forehead
presently
the
bitter
woman
eyes
opened
they
regarded
her
companion
steadily
with
an
expression
of
sad
wonder
still
beautiful
old
nan
began
to
protest
in
little
birdlike
whispers
she
was
so
nervous
lest
she
should
give
offence
she
was
interrupted
your
voice
is
young
people
who
do
want
to
love
you
have
to
and
i
always
longed
to
be
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
brushing
back
the
false
hair
had
the
goodness
of
life
i
had
the
falseness
things
are
they
not
fair
nan
assented
been
hard
on
you
poor
old
oh
yes
jehane
spoke
the
words
gropingly
as
though
recollecting
yes
god
he
and
i
have
been
talking
to
one
another
lately
the
cares
of
this
world
the
cares
of
this
world
what
is
that
passage
i
trying
to
remember
about
the
sower
who
sows
the
good
seed
but
the
cares
of
this
world
rise
up
and
choke
it
unless
it
falls
on
fruitful
land
something
like
jehane
looked
at
nan
vaguely
only
land
that
the
difficulty
i
was
never
fruitful
land
tell
me
why
did
you
marry
billy
i
never
thought
about
about
it
now
why
was
it
suppose
because
i
loved
him
and
wanted
to
help
jehane
elbow
slipped
from
under
her
she
lay
back
staring
at
the
ceiling
looking
gaunt
and
faded
as
though
she
had
passed
through
a
long
illness

him
when
i
loved

hard
on

i

i
a
hard
woman
i
got
what
i
deserved
and
ocky
he
was
a
fool
he
had
no
mind
never
read
anything
he
was
clumsy
and
liked
vulgar
people
best
but
perhaps
he
my
doing
perhaps
seeing
that
she
had
grown
passive
nan
stole
out
to
give
the
children
their
supper
and
to
put
them
to
bed
that
night
the
first
time
since
cassingland
she
and
jehane
slept
together
the
light
had
been
put
out
for
some
time
and
nan
was
growing
drowsy
when
jehane
spoke

it

a
house
built
on

a
house
built
on
that
what
we
came
here
to
do

we

for
ourselves

chapter
xviii
peter
to
the
rescue
it
was
all
up
a
warrant
was
out
for
the
arrest
of
ocky
accusers
came
forward
from
all
directions
people
whom
glib
promises
had
kept
silent
and
people
who
had
kept
themselves
silent
because
they
were
friends
of
barrington
now
that
silence
had
lost
its
virtue
they
shouted
their
numbers
and
the
noise
they
made
were
a
revelation
and
testimonial
of
a
sort
to
ocky
enterprising
character
he
must
have
been
skating
over
thin
ice
for
years
he
had
almost
established
a
record
such
a
performance
so
dexterous
and
long
protracted
had
required
a
kind
of
gay
courage
that
is
rarely
given
to
honest
men
and
ocky
was
honest
by
tradition
if
not
in
practice
his
nerve
was
admirable
no
wonder
he
drank
he
was
wanted
on
many
charges
there
were
checks
which
he
had
cashed
through
tradesmen
drawn
on
banks
where
he
had
no
effects
with
his
habitual
folly
he
had
left
tracks
by
negotiating
some
of
these
in
london
since
his
flight
using
letters
of
a
family
nature
from
barrington
to
inspire
confidence
these
began
to
be
presented
five
weeks
after
his
departure
from
sandport
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
been
doing
himself
well
and
his
supplies
were
exhausted
his
name
found
its
way
into
the
papers
largely
because
he
was
barrington
cousin
so
everything
became
public
the
day
before
the
reports
occurred
in
the
press
a
man
of
his
appearance
had
enquired
at
cook
in
ludgate
circus
about
the
exchange
rates
for
french
money
the
channel
boats
had
been
watched
in
consequence
but
he
must
have
taken
warning
and
altered
his
plans
ineffectual
even
in
his
sinning
said
barrington
the
fool
have
skipped
the
country
earlier
and
saved
us
the
humiliation
of
a
trial
the
sandport
real
estate
concern
had
gone
into
bankruptcy
its
affairs
would
not
bear
inspection
playfair
had
vanished
with
all
the
odds
and
ends
that
ocky
had
spared
both
of
them
were
badly
wanted
so
jehane
scornful
loyalty
in
stopping
on
at
madeira
lodge
that
her
husband
retreat
might
be
covered
no
longer
served
any
good
purpose
moreover
every
thing
in
the
house
was
seized
by
creditors
even
her
own
possessions
were
no
longer
hers
because
they
had
passed
as
ocky
she
and
her
children
found
themselves
penniless
her
father
when
applied
to
presented
her
with
a
list
of
the
sums
he
had
already
advanced
unbeknown
to
her
he
laid
pedantic
emphasis
on
his
early
objections
to
the
hurry
of
her
second
marriage
she
had
always
been
wayward
he
offered
to
take
glory
and
riska
to
live
with
him
for
a
time
but
could
put
up
with
the
younger
children
her
independence
had
been
her
undoing
it
must
be
her
making
now
she
must
work
the
first
homeric
scholar
in
europe
could
afford
to
have
his
peace
of
mind
disturbed
he
was
sorry
against
her
will
jehane
was
forced
to
accept
the
charity
of
the
man
whom
she
both
loved
and
hated
she
came
to
him
a
fortnight
before
christmas
with
her
four
children
it
was
the
first
christmas
she
had
spent
at
topbury
since
her
engagement
to
the
unfortunate
waffles
barrington
relations
with
were
painfully
strained
he
hated
the
intrusion
of
her
sordid
problems
on
the
sheltered
quiet
of
his
family
he
was
aware
that
she
had
grown
careless
of
refinement
in
the
vulgarity
of
her
experience
she
was
no
longer
the
oxford
daughter
soft
in
speech
and
lively
eyed
but
a
woman
inclined
to
be
and
nagging
he
blamed
her
was
sorry
for
her
and
wanted
to
be
kind
to
her
but
it
was
difficult
to
be
kind
to
jehane
when
her
feelings
were
raw
and
wounded
she
refused
pity
and
was
as
hurt
by
the
comfort
which
he
permitted
her
to
share
as
if
it
were
something
of
which
he
had
robbed
her
she
spoke
continually
of
poor
children
betraying
jealousy
for
the
lot
of
kay
and
peter
an
additional
cause
of
grievance
was
found
in
eustace
he
was
an
amiable
mild
boy
dull
and
fond
of
being
petted
the
miniature
of
his
father
barrington
knew
he
was
unjust
but
his
repulsion
was
physical
he
could
not
restrain
his
dislike
of
the
child
whose
sole
offence
was
his
strong
resemblance
to
the
man
who
had
caused
this
misery
jehane
was
cut
to
the
quick
being
forced
to
be
humble
she
sulked
nan
tried
to
play
the
part
of
peacemaker
she
was
proud
of
the
nobility
of
her
husband
she
understood
his
occasional
flashes
of
temper
he
was
overburdened
he
was
doing
far
more
for
jehane
than
she
had
any
right
to
expect
he
had
made
himself
responsible
for
all
the
swindles
in
which
his
name
had
been
employed
as
an
inducement
to
fulfil
these
obligations
he
was
sacrificing
many
of
his
even
the
landscape
by
cuyp
was
threatened
and
she
also
understood
jehane
predicament
she
was
too
gentle
to
resent
her
seeming
ingratitude
looking
back
over
the
long
road
from
girlhood
she
marveled
at
her
friend
fortitude
that
she
could
still
lift
up
her
head
proudly
and
in
spite
of
bludgeonings
plan
for
the
future
jehane
might
scold
and
grumble
to
her
when
barrington
back
was
turned
it
made
no
difference
to
her
unvarying
tenderness
and
there
were
times
when
jehane
was
ashamed
of
her
ferocity
and
laying
her
head
on
nan
shoulder
confessed
her
folly
cruel
she
wept
the
sweetness
in
me
is
turned
to
acid
i
shall
grow
worse
and
worse
till
at
last
i
shall
be
quite
impenitent
i
ca
help
it
life
wo
grow
easier
for
me
if
you
told
the
truth
you
write
over
me
lies
a
mother
who
loved
too
much
and
a
wife
who
loved
too
little
i
spoiling
my
children
with
my
fondness
and
filling
their
heads
with
vanity
and
i
shall
often
hurt
you
little
nan
but
you
stick
by
me
wo
you
barrington
was
suspicious
that
violent
scenes
took
place
in
his
absence
manlike
he
was
irritated
and
could
not
comprehend
their
necessity
he
was
furious
that
his
wife
should
be
upset
and
forbade
the
name
of
ocky
to
be
mentioned
in
his
presence
peter
overheard
much
of
the
abuse
which
was
showered
on
his
uncle
by
both
jehane
and
her
children
his
eyes
became
flames
when
harsh
things
were
said
quarrels
were
the
result
the
quarrels
were
for
the
most
part
with
riska
he
could
not
believe
that
anyone
he
loved
was
really
bad
glory
shared
his
grieved
anger
a
defensive
alliance
in
the
interest
of
ocky
was
formed
between
her
and
himself
it
was
the
first
compact
he
had
ever
made
with
glory
but
she
was
too
mild
for
peter
too
much
of
a
saint
teresa
and
not
enough
of
a
joan
of
arc
glory
knew
that
she
could
not
be
valiant
in
secret
she
cried
her
heart
out
because
he
despised
her
cowardice
barrington
might
forbid
the
mention
of
ocky
name
but
outside
on
the
terrace
there
was
a
perpetual
reminder
a
tall
man
with
a
straight
back
and
wooden
way
of
walking
watched
the
house
he
pretended
not
to
be
watching
and
when
anyone
saw
him
from
the
window
would
stroll
carelessly
away
as
though
he
were
just
taking
a
breath
of
air
but
he
always
returned
he
got
so
much
on
nerves
that
he
finally
made
up
his
mind
to
accost
him
are
you
doing
here
always
hanging
round
i
wo
have
the
man
who
had
tried
to
avoid
him
finding
himself
cornered
answered
respectfully

to
say
barrington
slipped
him
a
sovereign
saying

these
things
is
allaws
painful
for
the
family
that
chap
was
a
mug
should
planned
things
barrington
thought
for
a
minute
then
he
asked
you
a
married
man
and
five
nippers
gawd
bless
look
here
put
it
to
yourself
how
you
like
to
have
your
wife
made
ill
and
your
kiddies
sent
frightened
to
bed
because
a
stranger
was
always
staring
in
at
their
windows
like
it
i
get
damned
peevish
i
can
tell
then
you
understand
what
i
going
to

detective
work

ca
have
my
family
scared
go
further
away
and
watch
from
a
distance
is
it
a
bargain
just
then
barrington
turned
and
saw
peter
standing
with
his
satchel
across
his
shoulder
how
much
had
he
heard
he
was
awkward
under
his
boy
eyes
he
often
wondered
what
thoughts
went
on
behind
them
along
peter
i
be
with
you
in
a
then
to
the
man
it
a
bargain
ai
said
the
man
under
the
circumstances
you
do
it
i
not
trying
to
interfere
with
your
orders
were
awright
sir
of
the
wife
and
kids
i
do
that
night
peter
thought
matters
out
it
was
he
and
his
uncle
waffles
against
the
world
he
did
not
accuse
anybody
neither
his
father
nor
aunt
jehane
but
there
was
a
mistake
somewhere
they
did
not
understand
whatever
uncle
waffles
had
done
to
peter
he
was
still
a
good
man
peter
crept
out
of
bed
and
across
the
landing
to
a
window
in
the
front
of
the
house
he
peered
into
the
blackness
by
the
railing
of
the
fields
at
a
point
between
two
where
shadows
lay
deepest
he
could
see
a
figure
watching
he
must
save
uncle
waffles
from
that
school
had
broken
up
it
was
the
of
december
there
was
still
no
news
of
ocky
in
their
anxiety
they
had
almost
forgotten
that
would
be
christmas
that
morning
barrington
dawdled
over
his
breakfast
postponing
his
departure
for
business
his
wife
glanced
down
the
table
at
him
trying
to
conjecture
the
motive
of
his
dallying
presently
he
signaled
her
with
his
eyes
raising
his
brows
at
the
children
when
she
had
excused
them
he
turned
to
her
and
jehane
happened
or
is
going
to
happen
we
do
want
to
rob
the
kiddies
of
their
pleasure
do
we
we
got
to
pull
ourselves
together
and
pretend
to
forget
and
try
to
be
cheerful
what
say
nan
thought
of
that
but
i
did
like
to
mention
it
janey
and
i
working
together
can
get
things
right
then
and
i
see
to
the
he
rose
and
laid
his
hand
on
jehane
shoulder
jehane
things
are
never
so
bad
but
what
they
may
mend
i
not
always
been
considerate
of
you
let
be
it
was
one
of
those
truces
which
like
milestones
were
to
dot
the
road
of
their
latent
enmity
kay
and
peter
were
brought
out
their
savings
for
the
year
were
counted
nan
gave
to
jehane
children
an
equal
sum
with
which
to
go
out
and
buy
presents
peter
was
kept
running
all
morning
on
errands
in
the
afternoon
he
was
busy
decorating
with
mistletoe
and
holly
the
preparations
were
so
belated
that
everyone
was
pressed
into
service
tea
was
over
and
the
dark
had
fallen
when
he
set
out
to
do
his
own
shopping
careful
peter
and
come
back
quickly
his
mother
called
from
the
doorway
and
kay
thrusting
her
vivid
little
face
under
her
arm
piped
up
be
peter
do
buy
too
much
birfdays
is
peter
felt
happy
it
was
as
though
a
long
sickness
had
ended
and
a
life
that
had
been
despaired
of
had
been
restored
to
them
he
knew
that
nothing
for
the
better
had
really
happened
but
because
people
had
laughed
it
seemed
as
if
it
had
down
in
the
vale
of
holloway
the
bells
of
the
chapel
of
ease
were
ringing
they
seemed
to
be
saying
over
and
over
and
to
far
away
at
the
bottom
of
the
crescent
he
could
see
the
spume
of
flung
against
the
dusk
all
the
shops
were
there
and
the
crowds
of
jaded
people
who
had
become
for
one
night
extraordinarily
young
and
compassionate
he
began
to
calculate
how
far
his
money
would
go
in
buying
gifts
for
the
family
formerly
there
had
been
just
his
mother
and
father
and
kay
and
grace
to
buy
for
now
there
were
how
many
he
counted
with
his
cousins
and
aunt
jehane
there
were
nine
people
he
would
divide
his
money
into
ten
shares
kay
should
have
two
of
them
he
was
passing
the
gateway
of
an
empty
house
a
hand
stretched
out
of
the
dark
and
grabbed
him
the
voice
was
hoarse
and
terrified
at
its
own
sound
peter
broke
away
and
jumped
into
the
road
that
he
might
have
room
to
run
he
turned
and
looked
back
he
could
see
nothing
only
the
walls
of
the
garden
the
gateway
and
the
wooden
sign
hanging
over
it
with
the
words
do
that
came
the
hoarse
voice

see

asked
peter

into

shadows

one
man

shaping
his
plan
yes

he
was
dropping
the
reins
on
his
horse
back
from

in

for

on

door
behind

leaving
peter
inside
he
said
while
he
removed
the
from
cat
meat
head
and
gathered
up
the
reins
the
old
gentleman
addressed
a
few
remarks
the
purport
of
which
was
that
grace
would
find
himself
without
a
license
as
the
cab
turned
to
climb
the
crescent
grace
made
an
effort
to

of

neared

empty
house

was
about
to
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
he
had
the
words
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
say
here
so
much
were
they
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
that
he
almost
believed
he
had
said
them
but
he
darted
back
crouching
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
fusty
cab
at
a
little
distance
watching
the
gate
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
man
cat
meat
crawled
on
ascending
the
hill
at
the
top
where
the
terrace
began
grace
halted

whispered
from
inside

little
way

in
the
garden
of
the
empty
grace
whistled

his
throat
once
or
twice
and
spat
then
he
started
laughing
ter
me

wiv
the
he
pulled
his
horse
round

when

wanished
in
the
the
detective
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
set
off
running
down
the
crescent
as
he
dwindled
in
the
darkness
grace
called
after
him
and
cat
meat
miss
yer
so
agreeable
yer
were
merry
christmas
ole
then
in
a
lower
voice
to
peter
kin
forget
the
smallspecks
young
yer
but
peter
had
leapt
to
the
pavement
and
slipped
through
the
gateway
under
the
sign
uncle
he
gone
he
listened
the
shrubbery
about
him
rustled
he
looked
up
at
the
empty
windows
wondering
if
uncle
waffles
had
got
inside
the
house
he
was
a
little
frightened
the
darkness
was
so
desperate
and
lonely
he
called
more
loudly
uncle
make
then
he
heard
a
sound
of
shuffling
and
something
stirred
beneath
the
steps
he
ran
forward
and
seized
the
man
coat
it
was
sodden
dragging
him
through
the
garden
toward
the
road
it
was
strange
that
so
small
a
boy
should
take
command
of
a
grown
man
wo
give
me
up
peter
will
you
give
him
up
that
was
likely
fancy
peter
allowing
anyone
to
suffer
if
he
could
prevent
it
why
peter
when
romance
kittens
were
to
be
drowned
would
steal
them
away
and
hide
them
he
could
bear
that
anything
should
be
wounded
or
dead
he
pushed
his
uncle
into
the
cab
and
before
following
held
a
whispered
consultation
with
grace
remember
my
plan
what
i
told
you
grace
digressed
he
twisted
round
on
the
box
craning
his
neck
to
look
in
at
the
window
do
strike
me
as
much
ter
make
a
fuss
you
do
know
i
ai
pining
fer
an
you
not
going
back
on
me
grace
he
does
look
very
grand
but
he
kind
and
peter
was
dismayed
by
this
sudden
coolness
not
the
chap
ter
go
back
on
friends
hook
inter
the
keb
i
remember
wot
yer
told
at
the
top
of
the
crescent
they
turned
to
the
left
crawled
a
hundred
yards
and
then
turned
to
the
right
going
down
the
mews
which
ran
behind
the
terrace
the
mews
was
unlighted
and
humpy
on
one
side
stood
the
high
closed
doors
of
stables
on
the
other
rubbish
heaps
and
the
backs
of
houses
not
yet
finished
building
the
man
at
peter
side
said
nothing
every
now
and
then
he
shivered
and
seemed
to
hug
himself
once
or
twice
he
twitched
and
muttered
below
his
breath
there
was
the
stale
smell
of
alcohol
and
wet
clothes
about
him
to
peter
it
was
all
so
terrible
that
he
could
not
put
his
comfort
into
words
this
man
who
swayed
weakly
with
each
jerk
of
the
cab
and
crouched
away
from
him
was
a
stranger
not
a
bit
like
the
irresponsible
joking
person
he
had
known
as
his
uncle
waffles
the
cab
stopped
grace
waddled
down
and
blew
out
his
lamps
then
he
tapped
on
the
window
we
are
master
peter
counted
the
doors
this
the
back
o
yer
peter
stretched
out
his
hand
gropingly
in
the
blackness
and
touched
his
uncle
going
to
hide
you
so
you
never
be
ocky
voice
came
in
a
hopeless
whisper

in
when
peter
and
his
uncle
had
obeyed
orders
the
cab
was
backed
up
against
the
tall
doors
which

to
the

was
bidden
but
either
through
timidity
or
weakness
failed
to
scramble
from
the
cab
on
to
the
top
of
the
doors
grace
growled
impatiently
and
muttered
something
explosive
at
each
failure
now
that
he
was
in
of
contriving
against
the
law
he
was
anxious
to
be
rid
of
the
adventure
ocky
excused
himself

went
till
in

clutched
at

sadly
with
a
kind
of
air
peter
was
told
to

having
driven

few
paces
dropped
the
reins

brought
his
whip
down
lightly
across
ocky
legs
his
humor
made
him
a
humane
man
ocky
squirmed
lost
his
balance
and
disappeared
all
except
his
hands
which
clung
desperately
once
again
the
whip
came
down
and
a
muffled
thud
was
heard
grace
took
his
seat
on
the
box
and
gathered
up
the
reins
more
sir
he
asked
of
peter
keb
thirsty
work
master
peter
poor
chap
lost
nerve
needed
a
little
stimerlant

but
when
peter
tried

some
folks
as

done
fer

be
drunk

enough
o
me
time
awready
kum
beside
me
once
and
i
drive
yer
so
they
drove
round
the
mews
to
the
terrace
and
halted
this
time
in
front
of
the
house
when
peter
had
rung
the
bell
his
friend
beckoned
him
back
were
worf
it
were
before
peter
could
answer
the
door
opened
and
he
heard
his
voice
saying
it
peter
in
a
christmas
cab
oh
how
kind
of
grace
to
bring
you
back
were
you
so
loaded
down
with
presents
peter
and
he
entered
he
would
need
all
his
christmas
money
to
help
uncle
waffles
kay
came
running
to
meet
him
and
halted
in
bewilderment
mummy
where
are
peter
presents
grace
mind
was
taken
up
with
another
subject
from
the
steps
she
had
caught
her
father
eye
and
had
seen
that
it
was
glazed
as
she
passed
her
mistress
she
sought
sympathy
whispering
drunk
as
usual
mam
ai
it
fat
lot
o
good
me
prayin
but
grace
pottering
down
the
terrace
felt
a
christmas
warmth
about
his
heart
it
was
because
he
had
saved
a
man
from
justice
he
was
happy
because
peter
had
told
him
that
he
was
the
only
friend
in
the
world
from
whom
he
could
have
asked
grace
might
call
him
a
drunkard
and
he
intended
to
be
very
drunk
but
he
must
be
something
better
as
well
or
else
peter
would
have
talked
like
that
so
because
he
was
happy
he
sang
as
he
pottered
down
the
terrace
it
was
exactly
a
christmas
carol
but
it
served
his
purpose
it
expressed
contempt
for
public
opinion
and
that
was
how
he
felt
our
darn
our
darn
the
plaice
where
i
nar
why
the
gentry
in
our
street
in
the
cisterns
wash
their
feet
in
the
where
i
grace
very
rarely
sang
because
he
was
very
seldom
happy
meat
quickened
his
step
he
knew
what
that
sound
meant
it
meant
no
more
work
in
the
distance
the
lights
of
the
grew
up
chapter
xx
the
hiding
of
ocky
waffles
peter
christmas
cab
why
a
cab
what
had
he
brought
back
in
it
and
where
had
he
hidden
it
it
must
be
something
very
grand
and
splendid
to
demand
a
cab
kay
coaxed
him
to
give
her
just
one
little
hint
as
to
what
it
was
she
went
through
all
her
without
success
rubbing
her
silky
hair
against
his
cheek
and
kissing
his
eyes
while
she
clasped
his
neck
it
was
useless
for
him
to
declare
that
he
had
bought
no
presents
she
snuggled
against
him
laughing
she
knew
her
peter
better
than
that
in
the
high
spirits
that
surrounded
him
peter
was
very
miserable
he
was
wondering
whether
uncle
waffles
had
hurt
himself
when
he
tumbled
into
the
yard
from
the
top
of
the
doors
he
was
wondering
whether
such
a
timid
climber
had
been
able
to
find
his
way
into
the
loft
he
was
wondering
how
he
could
help
him
to
escape
to
safety
grace
might
not
be
willing
to
assist
a
second
time
he
had
said
that
uncle
waffles
worf
but
he
was
wild
plans
were
forming
in
peter
brain
would
it
be
possible
to
put
his
uncle
on
the
tandem
tricycle
and
ride
off
in
the
night
undetected
would
it
be
possible
to
and
then
there
was
another
thought
ever
since
he
was
quite
a
tiny
boy
he
had
had
a
secret
dread
of
the
loft
after
nightfall
a
fear
which
he
knew
kay
shared
it
was
all
right
in
the
day
when
the
sun
was
shining
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
then
but
his
strong
imagination
made
him
suspect
that
the
loft
was
used
by
tramps
hungry
tramps
when
darkness
fell
tramps
who
climbed
over
the
wall
just
as
uncle
waffles
had
done
if
that
should
be
true
and
one
of
them
should
find
his
uncle
there
peter
shuddered
little
man
you
been
getting
too
excited
his
father
said
do
want
you
ill
do
you
think
you
better
go
to
bed
and
peter
was
glad
of
the
excuse
to
get
away
to
where
no
one
would
observe
him
he
felt
an
outlaw
he
had
taken
sides
against
his
father
and
his
family
he
was
at
all
sure
that
he
had
committed
a
criminal
offence
the
police
if
they
knew
might
lay
their
hands
on
him
and
lock
him
up
with
uncle
waffles
what
would
kay
think
of
her
brother
then
in
the
darkness
of
his
room
he
lay
awake
listening
to
footsteps
in
the
downstairs
part
of
the
house
the
servants
came
up
and
the
gas
on
the
landing
was
lowered
to
a
jet
then
he
heard
the
rustling
of
paper
and
his
mother
and
father
whispering
together
for
wo
go
into
her
yes
it
will
at
a
who
this
for
for
peter
old
silly
go
and
lay
it
on
his
through
eyes
peter
saw
his
father
enter
straight
and
tall
with
his
cropped
hair
and
direct
way
of
walking
so
much
like
a
he
came
on
tiptoe
trying
to
be
stealthy
but
he
stumbled
against
a
chair
nan
came
hurrying
noiselessly
billy
darling
you
a
rotten
santa
claus
have
you
wakened
him
now
they
listened
when
peter
did
not
stir
his
father
whispered
all
right
kiddy
the
little
chap
sleeps
soundly
by
jove
he
not
hung
up
his
stocking
they
examined
the
end
of
the
bed
then
his
mother
spoke
he
has
he
could
have
been
feeling
well
he
been
worrying
i
sure
he
has
all
this
last
boy
of
his
age
ought
to
worry
what
about
nan
hesitated
peter
very
compassionate
he
loved
ocky
looked
through
his
eyes
often
lately
i
sure
he
condemning
poor
little
peterkins
it
must
hurt
well
he
they
bent
over
him
kissing
him
thinking
he
slept
always
fancies
that
everyone
must
be
good
whom
he
and
nan
answered
can
make
anyone
good
by
love
do
you
think
so
billy
he
slipped
his
arm
about
her
and
leant
his
face
against
her
hair
know
you
made
me
better
the
gas
was
extinguished
and
their
feet
died
out
on
the
stairs
one
two
three
the
in
the
hall
struck
out
the
hours
peter
could
not
bear
it
he
must
tell
someone
he
threw
back
the
clothes
and
crept
to
the
door
his
parents
room
was
under
his
they
must
not
hear
him
a
board
creaked
he
halted
his
fingers
on
his
mouth
his
heart
drumming
no
one
stirred
through
the
heavy
silence
came
the
light
breathing
of
sleepers
pressing
his
hand
against
the
wall
to
steady
himself
he
tiptoed
along
the
passage
past
riska
room
past
grace
till
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
glory
and
kay
lay
together
he
looked
in
a
shaft
of
moonlight
fell
across
their
faces
on
the
pillow
he
was
struck
with
how
alike
they
were
the
same
narrow
penciled
eyebrows
the
same
sensitive
bowed
mouth
just
a
little
short
in
the
upper
lip
the
same
streaming
hair
he
stood
looking
down
at
them
since
he
had
noticed
this
he
felt
a
new
kindness
for
glory
kay
turned
on
her
side
and
the
paper
on
the
presents
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
crackled
should
he
should
he
tell
glory
she
looked
so
gentle
no
it
would
be
selfish
he
must
endure
the
burden
of
his
knowledge
himself
and
yet
he
was
very
troubled
up
the
frosty
silence
tremulous
and
distant
climbed
the
sound
of
music
a
harp
and
a
violin
playing
his
brain
set
the
playing
to
words
came
upon
the
midnight
clear
that
glorious
song
of
old
from
angels
bending
near
the
earth
to
touch
their
harps
of
its
beauty
quieted
his
dreads
lifting
his
spirit
to
the
world
of
legend
it
hushed
halted
and
again
commenced
it
was
like
the
feet
of
jesus
on
the
london
bringing
safety
to
sinful
men
perhaps
uncle
waffles
heard
it
it
ceased
a
man
voice
rang
out
and
frosty
three
in
the
morning
a
happy
christmas
all
peter
had
turned
his
eyes
to
the
window
where
the
moon
sat
balanced
on
a
cloud
now
that
the
stillness
was
again
unbroken
he
looked
down
at
the
faces
on
the
pillow
the
eyes
of
glory
were
wide
open
she
showed
no
surprise
at
seeing
him
there
how
long
had
she
been
watching
he
stooped
over
her
and
whispered
was
the
waits
her
arms
reached
up
and
dragged
him
down
peter
you
do
hate
me
do
you
i
ca
help
being
a
we
wake
kitten
kay
of
course
i
do
hate
you
i
try
to
love
me
just
as
one
with
the
rest
not
even
with
the
rest
no
no
kiss
me
he
kissed
her
it
was
almost
like
kissing
kay
she
held
him
so
tightly
that
she
took
away
his
breath
he
drew
back
a
little
thrilled
and
startled
he
looked
down
kay
eyes
were
closed
glory
were
smiling
up
at
him
timid
with
puzzled
longing
years
later
he
was
to
remember
that
then
yet
more
distant
the
waits
like
the
feet
of
jesus
bringing
peace
to
sinful
men
and
that
also
he
would
remember
back
in
bed
he
lay
very
still
the
fear
had
gone
out
of
him
once
again
the
world
seemed
kind
and
gentle
was
born
this
morning
he
whispered
was
born
this
morning
oh
jesus
who
came
into
the
world
a
little
boy
just
like
peter
you
can
understand
i
so
troubled
oh
jesus
but
sleep
was
sent
in
answer
to
his
prayer
it
was
dark
when
he
awoke
what
was
it
he
had
been
dreaming
ah
yes
he
rose
stealthily
and
dressed
the
morning
was
chilly
his
teeth
chattered
and
shivers
ran
through
him
that
was
all
due
to
coldness
without
looking
at
the
packages
on
his
bed
he
stole
across
the
landing
and
down
the
stairs
outside
the
servants
room
he
listened
one
of
them
was
snoring
loudly
that
was
reassuring
as
he
drew
further
away
from
the
bedrooms
he
moved
more
hurriedly
all
the
time
he
was
expecting
to
hear
a
door
open
and
to
see
a
head
peering
over
the
banisters
having
reached
the
hall
he
ran
down
into
the
basement
taking
less
care
to
make
no
sound
his
feet
on
the
stone
flags
of
the
kitchen
seemed
as
loud
as
those
of
a
procession
marching
something
brushed
against
his
legs
he
jumped
aside
with
a
cry
of
terror
it
came
again
a
shadow
following
then
he
saw
that
it
was
only
romance
what
was
it
he
must
get
it
was
difficult
to
think
a
hammer
was
knocking
in
his
temples
he
felt
along
the
dresser
sent
a
pan
clattering
stood
tense
listening
found
what
he
sought
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
gas
the
light
helped
him
to
think
more
clearly
but
it
also
convicted
him
of
wrong
doing
everything
he
saw
even
romance
looking
up
at
him
unblinking
seemed
to
say
shall
tell
i
shall
things
looked
cheerless
chairs
were
pushed
back
from
the
table
just
as
they
had
been
left
by
the
servants
the
grate
was
choked
with
ashes
in
which
a
few
coals
glowered
red
but
he
must
hurry
what
was
it
he
must
get
in
the
pantry
there
were
so
many
that
no
one
would
miss
a
few
of
them
there
were
loaves
of
bread
an
uncut
ham
from
which
peter
took
some
slices
a
jug
of
milk
from
which
he
took
a
glassful
making
up
the
deficit
with
water
and
a
dish
of
baked
apples
he
helped
himself
feeling
horribly
then
he
thought
of
how
cold
it
was
out
there
he
crept
upstairs
to
the
cloakroom
and
unhooked
one
of
his
father
coats
from
its
peg
he
returned
and
took
a
cushion
from
cookie
favorite
chair
in
which
the
cane
was
broken
and
sagging
thus
loaded
he
unlocked
the
door
into
the
garden
closing
it
behind
him
and
shuffled
out
how
unfriendly
and
treacherous
everything
was
even
the
kind
old
mulberry
stripped
of
its
leaves
seemed
to
scowl
and
threaten
to
reach
down
and
clutch
him
the
laburnum
which
in
summer
was
a
slim
gold
girl
pointed
thin
derisive
fingers
at
him
across
neighboring
walls
came
an
icy
breeze
which
whispered
off
his
head
cut
off
his
as
he
tiptoed
down
the
path
the
gravel
turned
beneath
his
tread
dead
leaves
rustled
his
breath
came
pantingly
and
steamed
through
the
shadows
he
hoped
uncle
waffles
would
come
to
meet
him
and
yet
he
dreaded
he
could
still
feel
the
shaking
of
his
uncle
clammy
hand
as
he
had
felt
it
last
night
in
the
darkness
of
the
cab
sometimes
he
fancied
that
he
saw
him
crouched
beneath
the
bushes
he
paused
irresolute
should
he
go
forward
or
he
glanced
back
the
windows
were
wells
of
blackness
hollow
sockets
from
which
the
sight
had
been
gouged
out
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
window
ahead
the
behind
the
ivy
which
spied
on
the
garden
he
had
always
expected
to
see
a
man
face
there
it
was
to
be
a
face
about
which
the
hair
hung
long
and
lank
with
the
mouth
pendulous
and
the
eyes
what
would
kay
think
if
she
could
see
him
now
he
raised
the
latch
of
the
door
which
led
into
the
yard
he
looked
round
hesitating
on
the
threshold
his
imagination
told
him
he
would
be
clutched
forward
nothing
happened
in
the
stable
it
was
dark
as
death
he
set
his
burdens
down
before
entering
so
that
he
might
be
ready
for
a
hasty
exit
he
stood
still
his
left
hand
pressed
against
the
if
he
had
to
run
he
would
push
himself
off
with
a
flying
start
he
was
even
afraid
of
uncle
waffles
now
heavy
breathing
where
was
it
he
called
he
heard
something
whirr
and
jumped
back
the
same
instant
he
recognized
the
sound
it
was
the
turning
of
a
pedal
on
its
from
beneath
the
tandem
tricycle
with
many
groans
and
curses
a
man
emerged
all
over
that
what
i
hulloa
you
there
peter
oh
damn
that
another
on
the
forehead
disfigured
for
life
i
am
nice
way
you
got
of
treating
your
poor
old
he
pulled
himself
up
by
his
hands
even
in
the
dusk
he
looked
crushed
and
sheepish
but
every
situation
however
shameful
had
to
be
made
an
occasion
for
jest
how
i
came
here
tandem
trikes
make
strange
bedfellows
you
must
excuse
my
language
your
aunt
jehane
always
told
this
little
boy
he
must
never
as
his
uncle
approached
him
zigzagging
and
groping
for
support
uncertainly
peter
became
again
aware
of
the
stale
smell
of
alcohol
he
did
not
need
to
be
told
why
his
uncle
had
proved
such
an
inferior
climber
i
brought
you
here
last
night
i
and
grace
did
you
hurt
yourself
when
you
fell
did
i
fall
i
used
to
falling
these
days
i
a
bird
tumbled
out
of
its
nest
broke
to
the
wide
i
am
and
nobody
cares
nobody
peter
hearing
his
weak
sobbing
overcame
his
momentary
physical
repulsion
i
care

good
o
your
caring
dear
old
chap
you
only
a
boy
and
glory

girl

i
he
pulled
at
his
uncle
trembling
hands
going
to
hide
you
in
the
loft
till
they
all
forgotten
to
look
for
you
and
then
chappie
i
got
to
be
fed

sat
down
on
a
box
and
drew
peter
to
his
knee
in
the
darkness
putting
his
arm
about
him

terror

peter
drew
the
unshaven
face
down
to
his
shoulder
poor
poor

peter
tried
to
laugh
he
showed
his
uncle
where
to
find
a
foothold
in
the
wall
and
by
pushing
and
whispering
instructions
got
him
through
the
into
the
room
overhead
then
he
handed
up
the
results
of
his
foraging
and
followed
the
loft
was
big
and
cheerless
thick
with
dust
and
hung
with
cobwebs
across
the
roof
went
rafters
where
they
joined
the
wall
sparrows
had
built
their
nests
over
the
stalls
were
holes
in
the
floor
through
which
hay
could
be
down
there
was
only
one
window
at
the
far
end
which
looked
out
into
the
garden
several
of
the
panes
were
broken
and
let
in
the
wintry
air
ocky
shivered
for
comfort
he
fell
back
on
his
pipe
and
began
to
fumble
in
his
pocket
for
a
match
when
he
struck
it
peter
saw
for
the
first
time
what
he
was
doing
he
snatched
it
from
him
and
blew
it
out
you

peter
wisely

hesitated
and
called
him
back

glory

you
coax
into
the
garden
i
longing
for
a
sight
of
them
they
never
know
i
was
it
an
odd
christmas
i
going
to
peter
had
no
idea
that
the
time
had
flown
so
fast
as
he
passed
up
the
garden
the
sun
was
swinging
above
the
like
a
smoky
lantern
he
could
see
the
mold
beneath
the
bushes
glistening
and
frosty
chapped
and
broken
into
little
hollows
and
cracks
in
one
of
the
top
bedrooms
a
light
sprang
up
it
was
riska
she
must
be
examining
her
stocking
he
had
hoped
to
creep
into
the
house
undetected
but
at
the
door
he
was
met
by
cookie

one
claim
to
distinction
which
she
invariably
introduced
into
conversation
was
that
she
was
a
great
it
made
her
different
from
other
people
and
having
no
beauty

which
to
attract

a
topic

which
to

and
her

where

cushion
if
that
cat

peter
escaped
and
slipped
into
the
hidden
behind
the
coats
he
listened
to
cookie
stamping
up
and
down
breathing
threatening
and
slaughter
against
all
cats
especially
cats
who
stole
cushions
in
her
search
for
the
lost
cushion
she
began
to
make
discoveries
them
there

twenty
and
been

allaws
a
wery
honest
cat

wi
something
was
thrown
there
was
a
loud
romance
followed
by
sir
walter
scott
followed
by
cookie
fled
upstairs
peter
was
pained
that
others
should
be
blamed
even
though
they
were
only
cats
for
his
wrongdoing
anything
like
injustice
hurt
him
and
romance
knew
that
he
was
the
thief
how
could
he
ever
face
her
again
and
how
could
she
ever
love
him
if
a
cat
could
steal
a
cushion
and
cut
ham
she
could
also
take
a
coat
would
they
blame
her
for
that
he
was
in
his
bedroom
finishing
the
postponed
odds
and
ends
of
his
dressing
when
kay
called
him
he
pretended
not
to
hear
her
at
last
he
had
to
answer
he
went
to
her
like
a
guest
without
a
he
had
no
present
she
was
kneeling
up
in
bed
in
her
white
the
gas
was
lit
and
the
floor
was
strewn
with
paper
from
unwrapping
her
discoveries
christmas

peter
hung
his
head
glory

or
a
question
had
she
guessed

for
she
gazed
at
him
incredulously
her

with
disappointment
the
cab
peter
the
christmas
cab
was
nothing
in
it
i
not

anything
for
she
could
understand
it
he
could

that
she
was
saying
to
herself

but
her
face
brightened
bravely
something
for

it
kay

he
was
nearly
crying
with
mortification
nothing
for
you
little
kay
and
yet
i
love

better
than

in
all
the
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
with
the
divine
magnanimity
of
childhood
dear
peter
softy
me
it
do
just
as
he
returned
to
his
room
while
she
dressed
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
with
the
gas
unlighted
he
did
not
open
the
parcels
which
his
father
and
mother
had
left
he
did
not
deserve
them
he
had
nothing
to
give
in
exchange
he
would
be
ashamed
to
look
them
in
the
face
at
breakfast
especially
to
meet
riska
who
was
certain
to
show
what
she
thought
of
his
meanness
in
the
darkness
he
reflected
how
wise
he
had
been
to
give
that
money
to
uncle
waffles
before
the
temptation
commenced
kay
entered
downstairs
he
took
her
hand
she
pressed
his
and
laughed
up
at
him
trying
to
make
him
smile
back
it
was
their
custom
to
go
to
their
parents
bedroom
first
thing
on
christmas
morning
outside
the
door
peter
hung
back
but
kay
dragged
him
forward
billy
sat
up
throwing
back
the
counterpane
pretending
to
be
terribly
excited
at
the
thought
of
what
they
had
brought
him
kay
held
up
a
parcel
is
it
he
asked
me

it
what
is
it
father

to
guess
has
he
mother
be
silly
father
how
could
a
be
as
small
as
that
the
guessing
went
on
such
absurd
guessing
until
the
paper
was
torn
off
and
a
was
revealed
now
what
peter
brought
me
father
i

to
someone
who
needed

badly
badly
i
could
give
it
to
to
them
and
buy
presents
as
peter
swallowed
he
hated
lies
and
would
tell
the
truth
at
all
costs
it
was
last
night
it
was
this
his
father
regarded
him
gravely
someone
in
the
house
ca
see
how
it
can
be
both
in
the
house
and
out
of
it
it
must
be
exactly
one
or
the
silence

want
to
tell

want
to
so
his
mother
leant
out
and
caught
his
empty
hands
pressing
them
to
her
mouth
what
a
strange
little
conscience
this
son
of
hers
had
sure
he
did
what
seemed
to
him
more
generous
now
here
what
mother

of

eustace
had
asked
her
a
question
in
a
whisper
she
replied
so
everyone
might
hear
her
with
mocking
eyes
slanted
at
peter
he
spent
it
all
last
night
in
driving
about
in
there
was
another
shock
when
his
father
remarked
that
the
milk
was
rather
thin
this
morning
when
they
walked
down
the
terrace
on
the
way
to
the
christmas
service
they
passed
the
lean
man
he
was
watching
he
was
there
when
they
came
back
billy
noticed
that
his
little
son
was
furtive
and
restless
he
was
always
going
to
the
window
when
no
one
seemed
to
be
looking
and
peeping
out
into
the
garden
when
the
coat
was
found
missing
and
word
was
brought
of
cookie
lost
cushion
he
noticed
that
peter
got
red
he
called
him
aside
that
evening
is
it
ca
you
trust
me
you
tell
me
little
peter
how
he
longed
to
tell
but
he
looked
up
with
troubled
eyes
even
tell
you
during
the
days
that
followed
food
was
continually
disappearing
every
morning
as
a
habit
now
they
glanced
out
to
see
if
the
lean
man
was
there
then
the
eyes
of
the
elders
signaled
to
one
another
he
not
caught
peter
responsibilities
were
increasing
he
found
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
go
on
supplying
the
wants
of
his
uncle
without
betraying
his
secret
moreover
ocky
himself
was
getting
tired
of
his
confinement
a
loft
has
few
diversions
it
has
no
refinements
he
had
not
shaved
for
many
days
and
his
appearance
was
terrifying
the
mustaches
had
come
unwaxed
the
white
spats
were
gray
with
dust
and
climbing
still
when
peter
visited
him
he
was
unconquerably
cheerful
he
was
only
depressed
when
peter
had
again
failed
to
persuade
glory
or
jehane
to
come
into
the
garden
want
a
sight
of
sonny
a
marvel
like
you
ought
to
be
able
to
manage
frequently
he
discussed
marriage
with
peter
warning
him
against
it
and
tracing
his
own
downfall
to
it
awright
if
you
meet
the
right
girl
but
you
never
do
that
my
experience
people
think
you
have
but
you
know
you
have
i
knew
a
chap
his
wife
had
black
hair
they
seemed
so
happy
that
folk
called
the
well
this
chap
used
to
get
drunk
not
often
you
know
but
just
as
often
as
was
sensible
well
when
he
was
drunk
he
give
himself
away
oh
entirely
let
all
his
bitterness
out
he
always
hoped
that
he
marry
a
girl
with
yellow
hair
his
wife
was
awright
except
for
that
but
he
could
forget
it
of
course
he
never
told
her
but
there
always
something
like
that
in
marriage
something
that
rankles
and
that
you
keep
to
yourself
that
little
something
wrong
spoils
all
the
rest
then
one
day
there
a
row
chaps
have
killed
their
girls
for
less
than
ah
yes
and
folk
called
the
or
he
would
say
a
funny
thing
peter
some
men
fall
in
love
with
the
slope
of
a
throat
or
the
shape
of
a
nose
and
marry
a
girl
for
that
now
there
was
a
chap
i
once
knew
umph
did
i
ever
tell
you
this
chap
and
his
wife
were
known
as
the
and
his
wife
had
black
then
out
would
come
the
same
old
story
jehane
had
black
hair
peter
wondered
whether
chap
was
uncle
waffles
and
he
wondered
more
than
that
he
was
surprised
that
uncle
waffles
should
keep
on
forgetting
that
he
told
him
the
story
already
he
supposed
it
was
because
he
sat
there
all
alone
brooding
for
hours
and
hours
mind
if
i
queer
peter
i
be
awright
if
you
let
me
have
some
but
peter
would
let
him
have
it
it
would
increase
the
risk
of
discovery
one
night
he
ceased
to
be
surprised
at
his
uncle
lapses
of
memory
his
father
and
mother
had
gone
out
to
dinner
the
younger
children
had
been
put
to
bed
jehane
and
glory
were
sitting
by
the
fire
darning
socks
and
whispering
of
the
future
peter
took
his
opportunity
slipped
into
the
garden
and
down
to
the
stables
snow
was
on
the
ground
every
footstep
showed
like
a
blot
of
ink
on
white
paper
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
someone
had
crossed
the
then
he
was
startled
by
a
thought
perhaps
the
police
or
the
man
whom
grace
called
spotter
had
guessed
he
listened
no
sound
he
entered
the
yard
the
footprints
led
into
the
stable
he
called
softly
you
there
no
one
answered
with
fear
in
his
heart
he
climbed
into
the
loft
uncle
waffles
had
vanished
chapter
xxi
strange
happenings
had
they
caught
him
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
adventure
peter
had
wondered
interminably
how
it
would
end
he
had
been
able
to
see
any
ending
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
if
nothing
was
found
out
uncle
waffles
might
go
on
hiding
in
the
loft
forever
and
he
might
go
on
pilfering
for
him
peter
had
watched
his
uncle
carefully
he
knew
much
more
about
him
now
he
knew
that
he
was
a
great
disreputable
child
much
younger
than
himself
who
would
always
be
dependent
on
somebody
he
came
to
realize
that
through
all
those
years
of
large
talking
his
uncle
had
never
been
a
man
never
would
be
now
that
he
was
just
a
large
boy
boastful
affectionate
and
unreliable
whose
sins
were
not
wickedness
but
naughtiness
the
odd
strain
of
maternity
in
peter
which
prompted
him
always
to
shelter
things
weaker
than
himself
made
him
love
his
uncle
the
more
for
this
knowledge
and
now
he
was
distracted
like
a
bantam
hen
which
has
hatched
out
a
swan
and
lost
it
he
set
to
work
searching
in
the
under
the
tandem
tricycle
in
the
he
went
out
into
the
yard
following
the
footprints
they
led
through
the
door
into
the
garden
under
the
pear
trees
across
a
to
a
neighbor
wall
and
there
terminated
abruptly
what
could
have
happened
the
night
about
him
was
spectacular
and
glistening
as
a
picture
on
a
christmas
card
everything
in
sight
was
draped
in
exaggerated
purity
like
sprinkled
with
powdered
glass
snow
lay
along
the
arms
of
trees
and
sparkled
in
festoons
on
withered
creepers
the
march
of
those
countless
london
feet
that
invisible
hurrying
army
always
weary
yet
never
halting
came
to
him
muffled
as
though
it
moved
across
a
heavy
carpet
quiet
be
quiet
said
the
golden
windows
mounting
in
a
barricade
of
houses
against
the
stars
quiet
be
quiet
whispered
the
shrouded
trees
as
their
burdened
branches
creaked
and
lowered
but
he
could
not
be
quiet
cold
as
it
was
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
what
had
happened
a
crunching
sound
a
mere
rumor
seeming
infinitely
distant
a
head
appeared
above
the
wall
right
over
him
a
man
lumbered
across
and
fell
with
a
gentle
thud
almost
at
his
feet
how
could
you
how
could
you
do
that
the
voice
which
answered
was
thick
and
truculent
it
made
no
pretence
at
being
secret
why
should
i
that
what
i
ask
i
was
tired
of
sticking
up
there
it
no
joke
i
can
tell
where
you
been
a
way
out
four
gardens
down
the
wall
lower
no
danger
of
breaking
one
legs
not
like
the
way
you
brought
peter
was
a
little
staggered
by
this
hostile
manner
it
was
as
though
he
were
being
charged
with
having
done
something
wilfully
unfair
and
cruel
they
see
that
somebody
been
there
they
follow
your
tracks
from
garden
to
garden
and
then
do
care
let
you
never
do
anything
i
ask
you
you
let
me
see
jehane
and
glory
they
my
flesh
and
blood
and
who
are
you
you
would
give
me
any
baccy
you
gave
me
nothing
buried
me
alive
that
what
you
did
for
me
so
i
just
slipped
off
by
it
was
like
an
angry
child
talking
ocky
pulled
a
bottle
from
his
pocket
drew
the
cork
with
his
teeth
and
tilted
the
neck
against
his
mouth
have
my
medicine
ah
peter
watched
him
he
was
thinking
fast
remembering
past
queernesses
of
temper
done
this
before
course
and
not
ashamed
of
it
either
i
do
it
again
as
soon
as
i
get
thirsty
it
cold
up
he
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
loft
it
ever
struck
you
peter
disregarded
the
question
did
it
with
my
money
the
money
that
was
to
help
is
it
helping
me
another
long
draught
better
you
gave
it
me
to
take
care
of
i
taking
care
of
it
see
you
ought
to
know
by
now
that
i
not
to
be
peter
saw
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
arguing
he
helped
his
uncle
to
scramble
into
the
loft
be
lucky
if
you
not
caught
by
so
what
the
odds
could
be
worse
off
now
shut
up
scolding
you
as
bad
as
jehane
let
be
social
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
story
about
the
chap
whose
wife
had
black
hair
you
did
i
know
now
that
you
been
drinking
every
time
you
told
really
awright
you
need
get
huffy
it
a
good
peter
had
at
last
hit
on
a
plan
you
promise
to
stop
here
if
i
promise
to
find
you
a
better
place
you
talking
marvel
that
what
you
are
before
i
promise
i
must
hear
more
where
is
it
he
spoke
with
the
of
a
townsman
engaging
seaside
lodgings
he
was
ocky
waffles
esquire
capitalist
who
was
to
be
beaten
at
a
bargain
it
probably
be
in
a
on
the
promise
me
you
wo
go
out
again
be
able
when
i
polished
off
this
peter
appreciated
the
unblushing
honesty
of
that
prophecy
before
he
went
he
said
my
fault
i
ought
to
have
thought
how
lonely
it
was
for
uncle
waffles
tried
to
get
up
but
found
that
he
maintained
his
dignity
better
in
a
sitting
posture
take
it
to
heart
sonny
forgive
and
forget
that
my
he
reached
up
his
hand
to
peter
with
a
fine
air
of
christian
charity
peter
just
touched
it
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
that
night
knowing
that
her
mistress
was
out
grace
had
done
a
thing
which
was
forbidden
there
was
a
passage
running
by
the
side
of
the
house
ending
in
a
door
which
gave
access
to
the
terrace
during
the
day
it
was
kept
on
the
latch
for
the
use
of
the
children
the
dustman
the
gardener
and
all
persons
of
secondary
importance
it
saved
continual
answering
of
the
and
prevented
muddy
boots
from
tramping
through
the
hall
at
night
it
was
locked
and
the
key
was
hung
up
outside
the
diningroom
where
anyone
would
be
heard
who
tried
to
get
it
grace
had
borrowed
the
key
and
admitted
her
policeman
she
very
rarely
got
the
chance
and
always
had
to
do
it
in
secret
barrington
was
firm
regarding
kitchen
company
wo
have
strange
men
lolling
in
my
house
without
my
knowledge
that
how
burglaries
happen
the
servants
can
meet
their
friends
on
their
nights
out
i
may
seem
harsh
but
it
none
of
my
business
to
supply
with
opportunities
for
getting
so
grace
had
to
do
her
on
one
evening
a
week
walking
the
pavements
with
the
object
of
her
passion
now
and
then
she
contrived
stolen
interviews
after
nightfall
standing
on
the
steps
which
led
up
from
the
area
and
talking
across
the
railings
cookie
sympathized
with
her
and
helped
her
a
burnin
shime
she
said
us
like
a
wonder
ter
me
as
we
get
married
the
master
thinks
that
we
servants

ai

this
evening
when
grace
had
stopped
her
lover
on
his
beat
cookie
had
suggested
that
they
should
borrow
the
key
and
let
him
into
the
kitchen
by
the
that
was
why
peter
heard
a
man
voice
when
he
crept
stealthily
into
the
basement
the
sound
was
so
unexpected
that
he
paused
to
listen
without
any
intention
of
eavesdropping
started
christmas

changed
his
mind
at
the
mention

omelet
for
he
postponed
his
departure
in
the
peter
found
glory
alone
aunt
jehane
got
a
headache
she
gone
to
lie
peter
took
his
place
on
the
his
legs
apart
his
back
to
the
fire
in
unconscious
imitation
of
his
father
glory
bowed
her
head
hiding
her
face
and
went
on
with
her
darning
peter
watched
her
how
slight
she
was
how
lonely
she
looked
in
the
great
then
it
struck
him
that
she
was
always
working
and
that
aunt
jehane
very
frequently
had
headaches
you
ever
want
to
play
glory
yes
i
say
it
like
that
just
the
good
of
wanting
the
head
bowed
lower
the
firelight
shone
in
her
hair
her
face
was
more
than
ever
hidden
from
him
you
such
a
little
girl
a
whole
year
younger
than
i
am
when
i
want
to
play
i
do
you
it
was
always
like
that
when
peter
took
notice
of
glory
short
questions
and
short
answers
which
led
no
further
peter
leant
over
her
and
stayed
her
hands
do
like
to
see
you
work
so
sweet
to
hear
you
say
so
he
felt
something
splash
and
run
down
his
fingers
love
to
hear
you
say
that
but
you
see
there
no
one
to
care
for
us
now
i
got
to
do
it
i
always
shall
have
to
do
it
more
and
when
i
a
you
a
man
peter
what
then
i
a
man
no
one
shall
be
sorry
i
make
people
ashamed
of
prisons
and
of
letting
other
people
be
poor
no
one
shall
go
hungry
no
one
shall
go
unhappy
i
build
happy
houses
everywhere
and
oh
glory
i
take
all
the
little
children
with
no
shoes
on
their
feet
out
into
the
country
to
where
the
grass
is
she
looked
up
at
him
with
her
grave
gray
eyes
eyes
so
much
older
than
her
years
you
a
man
peter
you
be
i
did
say
it
to
make
you
say
that
i
said
it
because
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
there
a
day
coming
when
when
instead
of
making
you
cry
dear
glory
i
make
you
me
peter
all
by
myself
she
tilted
back
her
head
gazing
up
at
him
so
that
her
hair
rippled
back
across
her
shoulders
and
her
throat
stretched
white
and
long
like
a
mermaid
looking
up
through
water
peter
thought
me
only
peter
he
could
understand
why
she
should
always
want
him
to
do
things
for
her
only
she
was
selfish
like
riska
he
was
puzzled
i
make
you
laugh
and
kay
laugh
and
everybody
because
you
know
glory
we
all
ought
to
be
her
face
fell
the
eager
gladness
was
dying
out
of
it
so
he
added
hurriedly
most
especially
i
want
to
help
uncle
was
he
going
to
have
told
her
probably
he
did
not
know
himself
there
was
a
sound
of
running
feet
in
the
hall
grace
burst

was
trying
to
appear
very
brave
as

peter
took
one
swift
glance
at
glory

long
as

he
whispered
going
the
last

your

flew
down
the
path
the
window
was
in
darkness
directly
he
entered
the
stables
he
knew
what
had
happened
for
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
tobacco
uncle
come
down
grace
saw
you
strike
a
match
in
the
dark
and
a
policeman
coming
to
catch
peter
had
to
go
up
after
him
for
ocky
wits
were
clouded
he
shook
him
saying
haste

the
fear
in

voice
pierced
through
the
fog
of

and

across

yard
they
heard
the
grumbling
of
voices
approaching

on
the
tank
keeping
low
so
as
not
to
be
seen
from
the
garden

vanished

peter
warned

disgustedly

the
water
up
to
me
peter
had
hoped
to
get
out
of
the
stable
before
the
search
began
it
would
look
suspicious
if
they
should
find
him
it
was
too
late
for
that
the
voices
were
near
enough
for
him
to
hear

from

quite
loud

to
warn
any
burglar
now
that
they
had
quarreled
their
voices
cut
the
still
night
air
in
anger
not
a
word
was
lost
suddenly
they
paused
that
grace
asked
the
question
in
a
sharp
whisper
or
i
no

heard
the
click
of

cautiously
grace
was
clinging
to
her
lover
arm
they
both
looked
frightened
and
ready
to
withdraw
slowly
slowly
the
swept
the
surface
of
the
snow
footsteps
the
ray
of
light

along
the
tracks

but
to
himself
he
thought
in
this
than
meets
the
i
be
danged
if
there
chapter
xxii
cat
meat
looks
round
peter
kept
awake
for
his
parents
long
before
the
cab
drew
up
he
heard
the
jingle
of
the
horse
harness
and
was
out
of
bed
the
key
grated
in
the
front
door
in
the
silence
it
sounded
to
peter
as
though
the
old
house
cleared
its
throat
getting
ready
to
tell
leaning
out
across
the
banisters
with
bare
feet
shivering
against
the
cold
linoleum
he
lost
little
of
what
was
said
grace
met
his
father
and
mother
in
the
hall
grace
you
ought
to
have
been
asleep
two
hours
i
thought
i
told
you
not
to
wait
up
for
you
did
mam
so
you
did
but
after
the
disturbance
that
her
voice
sank
to
a
mumbling
monotone
then
his
father
spoke
never
heard
anything
more
ca
be
away
for
a
single
evening
without
a
stupid
affair
like
this
happening
lights
in
the
stable
indeed
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
and
you
a
grown
woman
i
wonder
what
next
grace
was
never
do
it
again
i
did
think
i
saw
no
one
know
abart
it
somp
wo
go
upstairs
the
children
be
frightened
for
months
peter
heard
grace
come
up
to
bed
sobbing
where
would
his
end
romance
had
had
a
broom
thrown
at
her
grace
had
received
a
scolding
the
injustice
was
spreading
he
examined
the
stain
on
his
heart
in
much
the
same
way
that
lady
macbeth
looked
at
the
stain
on
her
hands
would
it
ever
be
clean
again
he
told
himself
in
his
desperation
as
he
turned
to
go
back
to
his
room
he
was
alarmed
by
the
sudden
scurry
of
naked
feet
a
flash
of
white
disappeared
round
the
corner
and
a
mattress
creaked
glory
had
been
watching
when
his
mother
bent
over
him
that
night
he
told
another
lie
he
feigned
that
he
slept
as
her
fluffy
hair
touched
his
cheek
he
longed
to
drag
her
down
to
him
and
tell
her
all
she
would
stretch
herself
beside
him
in
the
darkness
holding
him
tightly
as
she
had
done
so
often
when
he
had
had
something
to
confess
he
denied
himself
the
that
night
as
he
lay
awake
and
listened
the
angel
in
the
cupboard
whistled
very
softly
very
distantly
as
though
she
were
carrying
kay
far
away
from
him
when
he
had
offered
his
uncle
a
change
of
lodging
his
uncle
had
said
on
the
peter
had
only
one
family
to
suggest
he
at
all
know
whether
the
family
would
accept
uncle
waffles
gentlemen
for
whom
the
law
is
searching
are
not
popular
as
guests
during
breakfast
despite
frowns
from
barrington
all
aunt
conversation
had
to
do
with
the
shock
she
had
suffered
by
reason
of
grace
folly
when
barrington
banged
his
cup
in
his
saucer
she
lost
her
temper
i
do
see
why
i
should
talk
about
it
i
had
to
put
up
with
the
worry
of
good
jehane
have
you
any
sense
you
can
say
anything
you
like
except
before
the
jehane
replied
pettishly
children
were
here
and
saw
peter
slipped
out
through
the
white
fields
he
hurried
and
through
topbury
park
where
the
snow
was
trodden
black
till
he
came
to
a
quiet
street
and
a
tall
house
with
stone
steps
leading
up
to
it
miss
madge
the
fat
and
jolly
miss
jacobite
answered
his
knock
a
long
face
for
a
little
boy
to
wear
you
please
i
like
to
speak
to
miss
miss
florence
was
the
sister
who
was
tall
and
reserved
she
managed
everything
and
everybody
i
do
peter
she
busy
at
i
got
to
speak
to
miss
madge
ruffled
his
hair
she
had
seen
his
mother
do
that
a
strange
little
boy
you
are
this
morning
you
look
almost
she
wanted
to
show
him
into
the
faded
where
a
meager
fire
was
burning
but
he
said
that
he
preferred
to
wait
in
the
hall
she
looked
back
and
laughed
at
him
as
she
mounted
the
stairs
he
did
not
reply
to
her
friendliness
then
she
ran
he
had
some
trouble
which
he
would
not
tell
her
he
stood
there
on
the
mat
twisting
his
cap
from
the
varnished
paper
on
the
wall
a
portrait
of
old
jacobite
looked
fiercely
down
it
seemed
to
say
to
him
coward
coming
to
a
pack
of
women
learn
to
bear
your
own
but
where
else
could
he
go
even
if
other
friends
were
willing
to
help
him
they
kept
servants
and
had
people
in
and
out
of
their
houses
at
the
misses
jacobite
provided
he
kept
away
from
the
windows
uncle
waffles
might
hide
for
a
and
never
be
caught
eerily
from
the
second
floor
came
the
sound
of
miss
leah
singing
her
song
never
varied
and
never
quite
came
to
an
end
peter
could
picture
how
she
sat
staring
straight
before
her
through
her
eyes
her
empty
hands
folded
in
her
lap
the
other
side
of
jordan
in
the
sweet
fields
of
eden
where
the
tree
of
life
is
growing
there
is
rest
for
it
almost
made
him
cry
to
hear
her
he
was
beginning
to
know
just
a
little
of
that
need
for
rest
a
door
opened
the
singing
came
out
to
his
astonishment
peter
saw
miss
leah
approaching
up
to
now
she
had
never
left
her
room
to
his
knowledge
she
beckoned
then
she
spoke
in
that
hoarse
voice
of
hers
heard
her
tell
florence
that
you
in
trouble
you
too
young
to
know
sorrow
that
comes
surely
but
for
you
not
she
placed
her
thin
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
drew
him
with
her
into
the
room
where
the
blinds
were
always
lowered
closing
the
door
she
searched
his
face
have
the
look
sorrow
sorrow
i
have
suffered
and
can
understand
do
be
afraid
tell
and
he
told
her
he
never
knew
why
or
how
she
listened
rocking
to
and
fro
in
her
chair
with
her
dim
eyes
fixed
upon
him
when
he
paused
for
a
word
she
nodded
encouragement
pulling
her
woolen
shawl
tighter
round
her
narrow
shoulders
in
spite
of
that
you
love
him
you
like
a
woman
peter
you
love
people
for
their
faults
and
in
defiance
of
common
sense
and
you
refuse
to
think
he
bad
not

said
peter
world
not
been
good
to

she
spoke
reflectively
as
though
she
groped
beneath
the
words
we
never
bad
really
only
seem
bad
to
other
people
till
they
make
us
seem
bad
to
yes
you
can
bring
but
to
bring
him
peter
needed
grace
help
and
grace
had
been
so
candid
in
saying
that
were
worf
when
he
reached
the
grace
was
there
he
had
waited
an
hour
before
he
saw
cat
meat
crawl
out
of
the
traffic
said
grace
with
an
instinctive
he
let
peter
explain
his
errand
without
comment
till
he
came
to
the
account
of
the
part
played
by
grace
policeman

twisting
a
straw
in
his
mouth
the
ears
were
pricked
up
he
nudged
peter
see
that
the

when

just

by

and
pays
no
to

frisked
his

again
grace
nudged
peter
that

but
not
much
ter

with
the
falling
of
dusk
they
met
peter
heard
the
wheels
coming
down
the
mews
slipping
the
bars
from
the
stable
door
he
let
his
uncle
out
a
nice
old
cup
o
tea
growled
grace
addressing

sign
the
pledge

ai
got
much
luggage

keb
ai
as
strong
as

ocky
retreated
into
the
darkness
of
the
interior
he
had
promised
peter
he
would
become
a
good
man
and
for
once
was
ashamed
of
himself
seated
by
his
side
peter
felt
after
his
hand
mind
what
he
i
am
it
true
i
been
a
mucker
to
you
from
first
to
ocky
coughed

a
cold
on
the
chest
sure
you
have
anyhow
you
going
to
be
better
to
try
till
i
as
the
cab
lumbered
out
on
to
the
terrace
a
man
saw
it
he
scratched
his
head
thought
twice
then
began
to
run
and
follow
coming
up
behind
he
did
what
do
he
stole
a
ride
on
the
springs
crouching
low
so
as
to
be
unobserved
cat
meat
alone
was
aware
that
something
wrong
had
happened
he
felt
the
extra
weight
and
halted
he
refused
to
come
up
up
wo
yer
no
he
would
he
planted
his
feet
firmly
there
was
something
that
had
to
be
explained
to
him
first
very
reluctantly
grace
got
out
his
whip
it
was
there
for
ornament
he
rarely
used
it
look
old
friend
do
wanter
do
but
he
had
to
cat
meat
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
and
looked
round
his
feelings
were
hurt
when
his
master
was
drunk
he
accepted
worse
punishment
than
that
without
resentment
but
his
master
was
drunk
now
grace
laid
the
whip
again
across
his
back
cat
meat
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
snorted
as
much
as
to
say
blame
me
never
say
i
did
warn
then
he
moved
slowly
forward
wonder
wot
was
the
meanin
o
that
reflected
grace
like

either
inside
the
cab

was
asking
if

like
the
why
do
you
take
it
dull
for
a
chap
said
ocky
he
would
have
said
more
but
was
shaken
by
a
fit
of
coughing
they
crawled
along
by
streets
purposely
avoiding
main
thoroughfares
as
they
drew
up
outside
the
misses
jacobite
house
peter
saw
the
slits
of
the
venetian
blinds
turned
and
guessed
that
four
tremulous
ladies
were
watching
he
opened
the
door
for
his
uncle
to
get
out
as
waffles
alighted
a
man
jumped
from
behind
the
cab

shook
his
harness
as
much
as
to
say
you
sorry
i
suppose
what
did
i
tell
you
peter
as
the
cab
grew
dim
in
the
distance
leant
against
the
wall
sobbing
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
steps
opened
timidly
and
miss
leah
looked
out
but
he
could
bear
to
face
her
as
he
stole
home
through
the
unreal
shadows
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
it
had
happened
it
must
be
his
old
disease
his
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
playing
with
fear
all
this
while
and
now
he
experienced
its
actuality
it
had
happened
had
then
the
pity
of
the
pinched
unshaven
face
the
huddled
shoulders
and
the
iron
hardness
of
the
world
overwhelmed
him
and
uncle
waffles
had
said
a
word
when
he
was
taken
he
had
even
coughed
chapter
xxiii
and
glory
said
peter
asked
to
see
his
father
alone
they
went
up
together
to
the
study
barrington
knew
that
a
confession
was
coming
he
was
curious
peter
sins
were
so
extraordinary
they
were
hardly
ever
breaches
of
the
decalogue
his
sensitive
conscience
had
framed
a
lengthier
code
of
commandments
which
no
one
but
he
would
dream
of
observing
barrington
struggled
to
keep
his
face
grave
and
long
inwardly
he
was
laughing
he
drew
up
his
big
chair
to
the
fire
his
soldier
chair
the
children
called
it
he
put
out
his
knee
invitingly
down
little
son
the
trouble
rather
stand
father
you
never
want
to
speak
to
me
again
when
i
told
barrington
observed
peter
pallor
and
the
way
his
hands
kept
folding
and
unfolding
ca
be
as
bad
as
that
old
man
nothing
could
it
is
father
i
a
thief
and
a
liar
and
i
expect
i
be
arrested
before
peter
tense
sincerity
carried
conviction
this
time
there
was
certainly
something
the
matter
peter
i
forgive
you
before
you
tell
me
now
speak
up
like
a
little
knight
the
bravest
thing
in
all
the
world
is
to
tell
the
whole
truth
when
it
easy
to
queer
things
have
been
happening
lately
it
about
those
christmas
presents
now
is
it
peter
stood
erect
with
his
hands
behind
him
his
curly
head
thrown
back
and
his
knickerbockered
legs
close
together
must
be
kind
to
me
father
it
makes
it
harder
i
going
to
hurt
barrington
had
never
felt
prouder
of
his
son
he
rested
his
chin
on
his
fingers
and
nodded
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
he
told
him
all
keeping
the
tears
back
bravely
when
he
paused
his
father
waited
he
wanted
to
hear
own
story
without
frightening
him
by
interruption
he
had
had
an
important
engagement
that
evening
but
he
let
it
slide
as
the
account
progressed
he
saw
that
here
was
something
really
serious
and
yet
how
peterish
it
was
to
feel
so
poignantly
the
unjust
punishing
of
romance
the
humor
of
it
all
vanished
when
peter
told
how
uncle
waffles
had
been
arrested
then
he
said
came
straight
home
to
tell
you
i
do
suppose
you
want
me
to
live
here
any
longer
it
would
be
good
for
kay
too
wicked
i
almost
too
bad
for
anybody
kay
kay
never
be
able
to
love
me
any
they
gazed
at
each
other
in
silence
barrington
did
not
dare
to
trust
himself
to
talk
he
knew
that
his
voice
would
be
unsteady
he
was
frightened
he
would
sink
below
peter
standard
and
give
way
to
crying
he
had
to
keep
his
eyes
quite
still
for
fear
the
tears
would
fall
and
he
recalled
the
last
confession
that
this
room
had
heard
it
was
from
ocky
he
compared
it
with
peter
the
minutes
dragged
on
peter
watched
his
father
face
he
saw
there
the
worst
thing
of
all
sorrow
a
coal
falling
in
the
grate
took
their
attention
for
a
moment
from
themselves
barrington
leant
further
forward
made
you
do
it
peter
loved
what
made
you
love
him
when
you
came
to
know
all
nobody
else
loved
peter
caught
his
voice
tripping
on
a
sob
and
stopped
he
made
other
people
unhappy
just
think
for
a
minute
aunt
jehane
homeless
and
so
are
all
your
know
but
it
seemed
so
dreadful
for
him
to
be
lonely
wandering
about
wandering
about
at
was
it
his
own
fault
peter
bit
his
lip
he
never
thought
of
not
loving
people
just
because
they
done
wrong
things
were
all
so
tangled
he
remembered
jesus
and
the
dying
thief
on
the
cross
surely
that
too
was
the
thief
own
fault
but
he
knew
that
people
rarely
quoted
the
bible
except
on
sundays
so
he
just
looked
at
his
father
and
said
again
the
minutes
dragged
on
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
glory
entered
shyly
going
to
bed
uncle
may
i
kiss
you
and
peter
goodnight
barrington
nodded
here
little
girl
but
first
close
the
as
she
stooped
over
him
he
slipped
his
arm
round
her
and
drew
her
to
his
knee
is
going
to
kiss
you
he
thinks
he
not
worthy
she
shook
back
the
hair
from
her
eyes
and
gazed
from
peter
to
her
uncle
incredulously
does
think
he
worthy
to
be
loved
by
any
of
us
he
expects
he
wo
live
here
much
why
why
peter
ca
have
done
anything
going
to
ask
him
to
tell
you
what
he
done
just
as
he
told
me
and
then
i
want
you
to
say
what
you
think
of
it
was
hard
to
have
to
repeat
his
confession
but
peter
did
it
while
he
spoke
his
father
could
feel
how
glory
body
stiffened
and
trembled
sometimes
her
eyes
were
unexcited
as
though
she
were
listening
to
an
old
story
sometimes
they
were
like
stars
fixed
and
glistening
when
the
end
was
reached
she
bowed
her
head
on
her
uncle
shoulder
shaken
with
deep
sobbing
father
oh
poor
father
as
she
grew
quiet
barrington
turned
her
face
toward
his
that
he
said
why
peter
thinks
he
is
worthy
he
waiting
glory
not
told
him
yet
what
you
think
of
she
looked
toward
peter
dazed
as
though
not
fully
understanding
then
she
saw
how
alone
and
upright
he
was
standing
it
dawned
on
her
that
he
was
really
waiting
for
her
to
pronounce
his
sentence
she
rose
to
her
feet
her
uncle
arm
still
about
her
why
i
think
peter
the
most
splendiferous
boy
in
the
barrington
laughed
know
i
did
dare
to
say
it
but
just
what
i
been
thinking
all
it
was
only
when
glory
arms
went
about
him
that
peter
sank
below
his
standard
of
courage
guessed
it
all
the
while
she
whispered
was
waiting
for
you
to
tell
me
why
would
you
let
me
help
you
ah
why
why
how
often
in
years
to
come
would
she
ask
him
that
question
not
with
her
lips
as
now
but
with
her
gravely
following
eyes

grace
husband
had
no

with

he
did
feel
the
need

conversion
and
grace
for
her
part
had
no
patience
with
men
who
refused
to
sign
the
pledge
somp
took
revenge
for
domestic
wrongs
in
his
official
capacity
by
moving
his
wife
along
when
he
found
her
beating
her
drum
at
street
corners
somp
punished
him
by
keeping
him
awake
at
night
while
to
use
his

words
she
sneaked
to

abart
him
she
even
addressed
god
in
the
highways
on
this
intensely
private
matter
when
she
saw
her
husband
approaching

followed

by
being

and
out
in
her
rebuking

and
exhorting
her
lofty
sense
of
right
and
wrong

him
he
grew
slack
lost
his
standing
in
the
force
and
gradually
ceased
to
work
his
melted
before
her
superior
morality
so
she
went
back
to
the
barringtons
by
the
day
to
do
charring
and
to
give
extra
help
that
was
how
peter
came
to
know
all
about
her
intimate
matrimonial
problems
he
heard
the
other
side
from
grace
and
somp
who
now
had
a
common
grievance
they
wanted
to
drink
and
grace
tried
to
prevent
them
you
never
marry
a
good
woman
they
both
advised
him
wimen
is
grace
on
the
other
hand
despite
her
frequent
complaints
held
that
her
husband
was
a
very
decent
man
but
having
proved
prayer
useless
she
could
think
of
only
one
other
remedy
i
was
ter
die

be
sorry
and
my
ter

but
i
ai
got
the
ter
do
to
which
cookie
would

sure
yer
dearie
it
them
as
should
do
the
after
ocky
arrest
a
period
of
flatness
followed
the
uncertainty
which
had
kept
the
household
nervous
and
hoping
for
the
best
no
longer
buoyed
them
up
until
they
heard
that
waffles
had
been
sentenced
they
could
make
no
plans
for
jehane
future
barrington
placed
money
at
his
disposal
for
his
defence
and
went
to
see
him
once
he
never
disclosed
what
happened
but
his
face
was
ashen
when
he
returned
all
that
evening
when
anyone
spoke
to
him
he
seemed
to
have
to
wake
before
he
could
answer
next
morning
he
told
jehane
wants
to
see
she
shook
her
head
dragged
me
low
enough
i
never
intend
to
see
him
that
the
way
you
feel
you
could
help
him
it
better
that
you
should
visit
she
looked
into
the
shrewd
gray
eyes
fiercely
she
wanted
to
find
anger
there
she
could
resent
anger
she
found
only
quiet
judgment
mean
that
you
actually
expected
me
to
go
to
him
expected
nothing
but
he
in
trouble
you
given
him
children
he
your
husband
in
all
your
years
together
there
must
have
been
some
hours
that
are
sweet
to
remember
i
did
rather
hope
that
now
that
he
in
trouble
you
might
have
remembered
i
do
i
ashamed
that
i
ever
had
right
it
strange
but
i
think
i
understand
he
still
loves
you
jehane
and
you
could
have
helped
the
what
the
value
of
his
love
think
its
value
once
was
whatever
you
cared
to
make
later
in
the
day
he
said
to
her
you
would
let
glory
see
him
i
suppose
he
mentioned
i
would
he
not
her
father
captain
spashett
was
a
the
children
were
never
told
what
occurred
at
the
trial
all
they
knew
was
that
the
man
who
had
laughed
and
played
with
them
who
had
loved
the
sunshine
so
carelessly
was
to
be
locked
up
for
a
time
so
long
that
it
seemed
like
the
and
of
the
bible
it
was
like
burying
someone
who
was
not
dead
they
seemed
to
hear
him
tapping
and
they
must
not
go
to
him
they
must
pretend
they
had
not
heard
he
was
a
thing
to
be
shunned
and
forgotten
jehane
was
anxious
to
earn
her
living
but
how
she
had
been
trained
to
do
nothing
barrington
bought
her
a
little
cottage
near
southgate
which
at
this
time
was
still
in
the
country
gradually
he
got
into
the
habit
of
letting
her
do
a
little
outside
reading
for
his
firm
he
did
it
to
enable
her
to
pretend
that
she
was
to
his
surprise
she
developed
a
faculty
for
the
work
and
he
began
to
trust
her
judgment
she
had
inherited
a
literary
instinct
of
which
during
her
married
life
she
had
remained
unaware
it
was
a
feeble
instinct
but
in
the
end
it
proved
sufficiently
rewarding
she
took
to
writing
sentimental
novelettes
which
found
a
market
whatever
her
faults
of
heart
she
had
always
been
capable
and
gifted
with
a
strong
sense
of
duty
so
now
that
she
had
found
a
means
of
making
money
she
worked
hard
with
her
pen
stinting
herself
and
treating
her
children
with
foolish
liberality
her
chief
regret
was
that
ocky
had
spoilt
the
marriage
chances
of
her
girls
she
tried
to
rub
out
this
social
stain
by
creating
the
impression
that
her
husband
was
dead
she
had
two
extravagances
the
purchase
of
and
a
mania
for
visiting
she
had
one
great
hope
that
in
the
future
she
might
this
would
entail
death
but
she
was
not
so
cruel
as
to
reason
that
out
she
had
one
great
mission
to
teach
her
daughters
to
catch
men
her
chief
theme
of
conversation
with
her
children
was
the
wickedness
of
their
father
and
the
heroic
loyalty
of
her
own
conduct
no
doubt
there
were
times
when
her
conscience
troubled
her
peter
was
just
fifteen
and
kay
was
nearly
nine
when
all
this
happened
it
made
a
deep
impression
on
both
of
them
but
especially
on
peter
for
months
the
crushed
shoulders
and
sunken
face
of
uncle
waffles
haunted
his
memory
so
that
it
seemed
a
crime
to
be
happy
he
could
not
bear
to
enter
the
stable
he
was
always
expecting
to
hear
a
hoarse
voice
addressing
him
in
a
whisper
from
the
loft
calling
him
a
marvel
or
enquiring
whether
he
knew
the
story
of
the
husband
whose
wife
had
black
hair
often
in
the
street
he
would
turn
sharply
at
the
sight
of
some
shabby
outcast
shuffling
through
the
crowd
with
bowed
head
he
would
run
to
the
window
hardly
daring
to
own
what
he
expected
when
he
heard
the
mournful
singing
along
the
terrace
of
a
group
of
got
no
work
to
do
we
got
no
work
to
do
we
all
thrown
out
poor
labourin
men
and
we
got
no
work
to
sooner
or
later
he
would
recognize
he
knew
in
one
of
the
tattered
singers
his
uncle
waffles
peter
was
suffering
from
a
suddenly
awakened
social
conscience
he
did
not
know
enough
to
call
it
that
it
was
partly
because
barrington
had
observed
and
was
distressed
by
his
boy
sadness
that
he
granted
his
desire
he
granted
it
to
give
him
a
new
interest
peter
had
always
dreamt
of
a
day
when
he
should
polish
up
the
tandem
tricycle
put
kay
on
the
back
seat
and
ride
off
with
her
into
the
country
peter
i
let
you
do
it
if
you
promise
to
be
very
it
was
early
summer
when
these
splendid
adventures
commenced
peter
had
to
do
all
the
work
kay
legs
were
too
short
to
reach
the
pedals
but
what
did
he
care
just
to
have
his
little
sister
all
to
himself
london
dropping
away
behind
and
the
world
growing
greener
before
him
what
more
could
a
boy
ask
to
make
him
happy
the
tandem
trike
was
a
clumsy
affair
desperately
heavy
and
beyond
belief
peter
managed
to
accomplish
six
miles
an
hour
on
it
the
way
out
along
green
lanes
to
wood
green
and
up
jolly
butcher
hill
would
have
been
full
of
ignominy
for
anybody
less
kay
flying
hair
and
plunging
legs
would
have
attracted
attention
had
the
tricycle
been
ever
so
new
and
handsome
stood
still
and
whistled
after
them
tradesmen
followed
them
in
their
carts
offering
to
race
them
and
grinning
ridicule
very
frequently
insult
set
itself
to
the
words
of
a
street
song
then
in
fashion
wo
be
a
stylish
marriage
for
i
ca
afford
a
carriage
but
you
look
sweet
with
your
two
little
feet
on
a
tricycle
made
for
what
did
peter
care
failed
to
touch
him
little
boys
who
pulled
faces
at
him
from
the
pavements
made
long
noses
at
him
or
stuck
out
their
tongues
did
it
in
envy
he
wished
he
could
take
them
too
so
he
and
kay
turned
their
heads
and
threw
back
laughter
it
was
fun
all
fun
and
then
there
was
the
anticipation
of
lunch
two
shillings
between
two
people
can
buy
so
much
shortly
after
jolly
butcher
hill
the
country
began
at
southgate
they
would
stop
to
see
their
cousins
riska
affected
to
despise
their
means
of
traveling
she
was
shooting
up
into
a
tall
girl
like
her
mother
she
was
darkly
handsome
and
carried
herself
with
a
gipsy
slouch
philosophy
of
teaching
her
girls
how
to
catch
men
was
already
beginning
to
take
effect
outside
the
she
had
a
little
table
from
which
she
sold
to
cockney
cyclists
she
did
it
to
make
even
as
a
child
by
this
means
of
introduction
she
gathered
about
her
a
group
of
she
was
learning
early
how
to
attract
when
she
cared
her
mother
was
pleased
by
her
foolish
conquests
in
the
air
of
the
cottage
garden
they
seemed
very
guileless
and
humorous
in
the
presence
of
men
whatever
their
years
riska
invariably
tried
to
fascinate
an
instinct
with
her
the
little
puss
said
barrington
even
tries
to
make
love
to
her
old
it
was
a
subject
for
laughter
in
the
family
on
these
short
visits
kay
and
peter
saw
hardly
anything
of
glory
she
was
doing
the
work
just
as
they
were
going
she
would
come
out
from
the
kitchen
untying
her
apron
or
would
pop
her
head
out
of
a
bedroom
window
to
shake
a
duster
and
smile
at
them
then
as
the
pedals
began
to
turn
riska
would
sing
and
eustace
and
moggs
would
join
in
with
her
pipingly
daisy
give
me
your
answer
true
i
all
for
the
love
of
you
it
wo
be
a
stylish
marriage
for
i
ca
afford
a
carriage
but
you
look
the
words
would
be
lost
as
the
tricycle
lumbered
into
the
sunshine
between
the
hedges
kay
used
to
say
when
she
was
very
little
that
the
gladness
went
into
her
feet
when
she
was
happy
on
these
expeditions
it
went
everywhere
into
her
feet
her
eyes
her
lips
her
hands
she
did
the
things
that
boys
do
and
yet
she
had
the
sweetness
of
a
girl
she
ran
like
a
boy
and
she
swam
like
a
boy
she
was
a
darling
and
a
puzzle
to
peter
he
could
never
make
her
out
he
was
always
trying
to
put
her
dearness
into
words
and
always
failing
voice
is
like
the
laughter
of
birds
he
said
why
do
you
love
me
so
much
peter
he
slanted
his
eyes
i
borned
he
knew
better
than
that
now
sometimes
they
spoke
of
their
cousins
did
something
horrid
this
believe
but
yes
i
was
brushing
the
dust
off
my
shoes
in
the
kitchen
and
what
do
you
think
i
found
up
and
tell
glory
had
had
time
to
eat
her
breakfast
and
that
some
of
the
dust
had
gone
into
her
plate
of
peter
how
careless
did
you
tell
her
came
in
and
saw
it
you
never
guess
what
she
mind
old
boy
one
got
to
eat
a
peck
o
dirt
before
one
dies
so
mother
says
and
she
took
a
spoon
and
ate
it
peter
nodded
trying
to
look
penitent
but
laughing
then
kay
became
and
asked
one
of
her
questions
do
you
you
what
to
eat
a
peck
of
dirt
before
you
die
peter
wriggled
his
toes
in
his
shoes
and
looked
down
to
see
them
moving
know
you
and
i
do
but
that
what
glory
having
learnt
to
walk
like
a
boy
kay
learnt
to
whistle
one
hot
summer
afternoon
they
had
ridden
out
and
were
lying
on
their
backs
in
a
field
tall
with
grass
nearly
ready
for
cutting
peter
had
almost
drowsed
with
the
heavy
smell
of
the
wild
flowers
when
he
sat
up
suddenly
and
seized
his
sister
by
the
arm
quite
roughly
she
was
only
whistling
a
little
tune
softly
and
was
surprised
at
the
strength
he
used
what
the
matter
you
hurting
i
sure
you
made
a
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
protest
you
learn
that
tune
you
were
whistling
know
just
made
it
up
i
suppose
i
never
heard
you
must
i
have
she
was
frightened
by
his
earnestness
mistaking
it
for
anger
you
never
hear
it
in
the
cupboard
in
the
bedroom
the
one
that
was
yours
and
mine
she
hardly
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
not
i
in
dead
the
tears
came
telling
the
truth
i
never
knew
it
till
this
it
ca
i
forget
as
the
children
legs
grew
stronger
they
went
further
afield
conquering
new
territory
exploring
all
kinds
of
dusty
lanes
and
they
had
turned
off
from
potter
bar
to
northaw
working
round
through
gough
oak
to
cheshunt
when
they
were
hailed
by
a
freckled
boy
about
peter
age
who
sat
astride
a
gate
playing
a
kids
want
to
buy
anything
they
jammed
on
the
brakes
and
addressed
him
from
the
trike
anything
to
sell
just
wanted
to
talk
and
had
to
say
who
are
you
lived
in
america
and
now
i
living
here
in
friday
lane
often
seen
you
go
they
looked
round
to
discover
friday
lane
on
every
side
was
a
sweep
of
country
rolling
away
in
fields
and
basking
woodlands
but
it
lonely
but
it
lonelier
where
i
come
from
nothing
but
indians
and
even
indians
did
turn
them
aside
they
were
trying
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
friday
lane
this
road
the
lane
the
the
boy
pointed
with
a
brown
hand
to
a
starting
from
the
gate
on
which
he
sat
and
vanishing
between
a
line
of
tall
oaks
oaks
which
had
probably
been
standing
when
the
land
was
part
of
the
royal
chase
there
are
any
the
boy
laughed
are
there
there
our
house
right
over
there
out
of
who
are
you
kay
and
peter
asked
together
harry
arran
and
the
house
belongs
to
my
brother
he
the
faun
man
i
kind
o
look
after
him
and
keep
him
straight
he
a
wonder
you
be
lucky
if
you
knew
like
to
know
him
we
both
like
to
know
him
very
again
they
spoke
together
the
boy
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
eyed
them
know
so
much
about
that
i
very
particular
about
my
brother
i
do
let
him
know
just
he
twisted
round
on
the
gate
turning
his
back
on
them
and
playing
giving
them
plainly
to
understand
that
their
too
eager
interest
in
his
family
affairs
had
made
conversation
undesirable
chapter
xxv
the
happy
cottage
it
was
the
way
in
which
the
boy
had
said
peter
gazed
beyond
the
gate
into
the
green
mysterious
depth
of
country
an
eden
from
which
he
was
excluded
by
that
hostile
back
his
eyes
followed
friday
lane
it
ran
on
trees
sunshine
and
shadows
tremulous
with
the
wings
of
birds
a
canopied
track
across
fields
into
the
heart
of
wooded
fairyland
what
promises
lay
over
there
a
voice
of
ecstasy
kept
calling
reluctantly
he
set
his
feet
against
the
pedals
glanced
across
his
shoulder
to
kay
and
was
going
to
have
said
something
that
glistened
shot
down
her
cheek
and
swiftly
vanished
very
deliberately
he
dismounted
or
a
tune
not
unlike
it
was
being
played
at
the
moment
he
thumped
the
student
of
the
in
the
place
from
which
eve
was
created
kay
all
legs
flushed
face
and
blown
hair
watched
from
the
back
seat
of
the
trike
the
novel
sight
of
her
brother
being
violent
the
boy
tumbled
from
his
perch
putting
the
gate
between
himself
and
peter
ended
abruptly
the
slipped
from
his
hand
the
freckled
good
humor
of
his
face
changed
to
an
expression
of
amused
and
fierce
intelligence
it
was
his
way
to
be
amused
when
he
was
angry
or
in
danger
kay
and
peter
were
to
learn
that
later
he
bobbed
in
the
grass
recovered
his
fallen
treasure
rubbed
it
on
his
sleeve
stuffed
it
into
his
knickerbockers
pocket
and
grimaced
across
the
rail
a
fresh
peter
removed
his
cap
his
curly
hair
fell
about
his
forehead
made
my
sister
cry
he
said
his
hands
were
clenched
one
leg
hopped
over
the
gate
then
another
have
the
boy
denied
stoutly
have
you
called
her
anybody
the
boy
stepped
into
the
road
a
pugnacious
little
figure
what
of
it
girls
cry
for
peter
drew
himself
erect
sister
the
boy
raised
his
eyes
and
met
kay
ashamed
of
himself
but
more
ashamed
of
showing
it
he
spoke
stubbornly
doing
it
there
was
silence
a
small
strained
voice
which
sounded
not
at
all
like
peter
said
never
hurt
people
i
never
fought
in
my
life
but
if
i
did
ever
fight
i
like
to
punch
your
head
and
and
i
think
i
could
do
the
boy
lost
his
shame
and
became
happy
you
ca
anyhow
why
do
you
have
a
shot
at
it
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
commenced
to
take
off
his
coat
and
to
roll
up
his
he
did
it
with
an
air
of
competence
which
was
calculated
to
intimidate
all
the
while
he
carried
on
a
monologue
he
like
to
punch
my
head
head
why
i
could
get
his
goat
by
just
looking
at
him
in
america
i
licked
boys
twice
his
size
and
they
had
curly
hair
he
faced
peter
doubling
his
and
inviting
him
to
feel
his
muscle
that
say
kid
i
sorry
for
ready
peter
nodded
before
his
nod
had
ended
something
hit
him
on
the
nose
he
threw
up
his
arms
to
defend
himself
but
the
something
seemed
all
about
him
always
smiling
into
his
own
was
the
freckled
face
of
a
pleasant
looking
boy
so
pleasant
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
it
was
he
who
was
doing
the
hurting
and
peter
he
hit
back
valiantly
but
somewhere
at
the
back
of
his
brain
he
kept
on
seeing
pictures
of
the
boy
dead
it
was
disconcerting
every
now
and
then
when
he
should
have
pressed
home
his
advantage
he
shortened
his
blows
intentionally
with
the
strong
weakness
of
the
humanitarian
a
bird
rose
twittering
out
of
a
hedge
from
a
meadow
across
the
road
a
cow
hung
its
mild
head
over
looked
shocked
switched
its
tail
disapprovingly
mooed
loudly
swung
round
and
lumbered
away
uncertainly
like
a
distressed
old
lady
with
gathered
skirts
in
a
futile
endeavor
to
bring
help
peter
saw
it
all
his
faculties
were
unnaturally
and
desperately
alert
it
was
odd
how
time
lengthened
its
minutes
how
much
he
saw
and
heard
the
deep
blue
stillness
of
the
foam
and
wash
of
traveling
clouds
the
erect
and
listening
quiet
of
and
hedges
and
somewhere
out
of
sight
the
of
wind
in
distant
country
there
was
a
cry
behind
him
how
long
had
he
been
fighting
he
could
not
guess
between
himself
and
the
boy
rushed
a
little
girl
her
small
hands
commenced
to
beat
the
boy
furiously
she
could
not
speak
she
was
choked
with
sobbing
the
boy
arms
fell
to
his
side
he
let
her
aim
her
puny
blows
at
his
impudent
face
making
no
attempt
to
stop
her
suddenly
she
swayed
and
sank
into
the
flowers
at
the
side
of
the
road
peter
stooped
his
arms
went
about
her
the
boy
looked
on
gazing
from
these
strange
invaders
to
the
waiting
trike
it
was
he
who
was
excluded
now
he
wanted
to
say
something
opened
his
mouth
several
times
and
halted
at
last
he
stumbled
out
the
words
i
sorry
and
you
not
just
and
then
say
plucky
wo
you
shake
hands
the
bird
came
back
to
the
hedge
and
dropped
into
its
nest
the
cow
having
sought
help
in
vain
looked
distractedly
into
the
road
and
saw
a
boy
pushing
open
a
gate
while
another
boy
a
little
bruised
and
battered
pushed
an
ancient
tandem
tricycle
into
a
meadow
and
a
small
girl
with
flushed
face
and
blowy
hair
dabbed
her
eyes
furtively
with
the
hem
of
her
dress
the
trike
had
to
be
hidden
it
was
unlikely
but
always
possible
that
it
might
be
coveted
by
tramps
friday
lane
lay
before
them
the
boy
turned
to
them
with
abrupt
frankness
what
your
names
peter
and
my
sister
is
peter
i
guess
i
hit
harder
than
i
meant
but
but
i
reckon
you
could
have
punched
my
head
if
you
chosen
did
get
warmed
up
to
the
work
before
she
stopped
us
was
that
it
they
were
up
to
their
knees
in
the
the
air
was
full
of
kind
new
fragrances
peter
eyes
were
dreamy
the
boy
rambled
on
leading
deeper
into
the
avenue
of
oaks
so
that
already
the
first
straggling
fringe
of
woods
commenced
brother
like
that
in
alaska
when
the
dogs
took
to
fighting
he
just
stand
still
and
laugh
and
holler
at
them
then
all
of
a
sudden
when
he
saw
that
they
were
eating
one
another
he
go
clean
mad
and
wade
in
among
and
lay
out
with
the
butt
of
his
rifle
he
a
wonder
my
sure
he
is
said
peter
and
kay
trotting
closely
by
his
side
repeated
his
words
to
show
her
interest
the
boy
flattered
by
the
attention
of
his
audience
with
the
treachery
of
the
born
sharpened
their
appetite
by
suspense
he
wagged
his
head
mysteriously
could
tell
you
heaps
about
him
if
you
were
to
come
here
he
waited
to
see
what
effect
that
would
have
kay
had
been
hiding
behind
her
brother
clinging
to
his
hand
now
she
came
level
with
him
bending
her
face
across
him
so
that
she
could
meet
the
eyes
of
the
boy
she
asked
we
peter
do
you
think
we
can
often
said
peter
guardedly
as
often
as
we
the
boy
held
out
a
further
inducement
day
i
might
show
him
to
you
he
like
that
with
dogs
and
and
especially
with
girls
laughs
at
hollers
at
and
then
he
the
most
chap
that
ever
came
down
the
pike
i
reckon
that
what
gives
me
all
my
neither
kay
nor
peter
knew
exactly
what
was
meant
so
peter
said
been
everywhere
have
you
and
we
we
just
tricycle
out
and
the
boy
had
drawn
his
from
his
pocket
and
was
playing
stamping
his
feet
and
swaying
his
body
suddenly
he
stopped
and
his
voice
took
up
the

of

wide
they
gazed
at
him
in
the
hushed
summer
woodland
then
they
beat
their
hands
together
crying
again
again
the
boy
smiled
tantalizingly
you
climb
he
shot
the
question
out
the
next
moment
he
was
scrambling
up
a
tall
oak
sometimes
his
body
was
lost
in
leaves
sometimes
it
sounded
as
though
he
were
tumbling
tumbling
through
the
branches
to
the
ground
at
last
from
a
bough
high
up
where
the
sky
commenced
his
impish
face
gazed
down
on
them
first
they
heard
the
then
the
voice
singing
of
somewhere
nowhere
anywhere
of
the
splendidly
imagined
through
which
every
child
has
longed
to
wander
and
they
believed
his
song
as
though
it
were
autobiography
in
a
they
saw
the
world
beautiful
tumultuous
full
of
terrors
saw
it
as
a
vast
balloon
swimming
through
eternal
clouds
painted
with
the
dreams
of
young
desire
islands
in
seas
where
palms
stood
motionless
pointing
to
the
skies
with
silent
hands
countries
of
yellow
men
small
and
crafty
who
lived
in
paper
houses
and
fed
on
flowers
enfeebled
cities
dazzlingly
white
whose
eyes
had
been
burnt
out
by
the
door
of
hell
left
open
in
the
iron
heavens
and
where
the
frost
carved
titans
with
his
breath
this
freckled
pugnacious
master
of
the
this
pugnacious
master
of
the
mouth
organ
caroling
a
street
song
in
the
of
friday
lane
became
for
them
the
embodied
soul
of
adventure
illustration
the
boy
came
slithering
down
kay
watched
him
how
he
dangled
by
his
arms
caught
on
with
his
legs
dug
in
with
his
toes
got
himself
completely
dirty
and
always
saved
himself
at
the
last
moment
from
falling
he
dropped
breathless
at
their
feet
fine
up
there
different
from
down
here
up
there
it
belongs
to
kay
was
quite
sure
that
she
approved
of
him
he
had
ripped
his
coat
and
it
did
seem
quite
kind
to
give
his
mother
so
much
work
she
spoke
reproachfully
like
tearing
your
clothes
he
gazed
at
her
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
with
a
sly
expression
do
mind
do
need
to
mind
my
clothes
are
magic
they
mend
themselves
she
tugged
at
peter
to
see
in
what
spirit
he
was
accepting
this
amazing
assertion
how
wonderful
and
then
reluctant
to
show
doubt
but
how
can
they
the
boy
grinned
broadly
really
you
know
just
pretence
i
i
mend
them
myself
i
an
awful
liar
come
on
confession
had
made
him
he
darted
ahead
kay
and
peter
followed
slowly
he
turned
you
coming
it
was
peter
who
answered
to
where
where
i
live
the
happy
was
this
also
pretence
the
name
sounded
too
good
to
be
true
and
yet
it
was
the
kind
of
name
you
tried
to
believe
despite
yourself
the
boy
left
the
grassy
avenue
and
broke
into
the
undergrowth
of
woods
he
went
in
front
parting
the
branches
for
kay
he
explained
to
them
lane
shorter
you
know
but
this
other
way
heaps
presently
above
the
rustle
of
their
passage
they
heard
a
little
singing
sound
sometimes
it
grew
quite
loud
and
near
them
sometimes
it
died
away
into
the
merest
breath
it
was
like
someone
who
was
almost
asleep
humming
over
and
over
the
first
two
notes
of
a
tune
that
refused
to
be
remembered
kay
snuggled
her
hand
into
peter
she
was
a
little
scared
everything
was
so
dark
and
eerie
the
sound
drew
near
and
seemed
to
slip
away
from
under
her
very
feet
she
cried
out
it
was
as
though
someone
had
touched
her
and
had
vanished
before
she
could
turn
round
the
boy
heard
her
cry
and
looked
back
he
nodded
reassuringly
always
doing
that
plays
no
end
of
pranks
you
need
be
frightened
it
wo
hurt
what
is
it
what
wo
hurt
you
peter
asked
almost
angrily
the
boy
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
wood
haunted
that
the
queen
fairy
calling
there
are
all
kinds
of
fairies
hidden
about
here
when
you
see
them
they
turn
into
rabbits
and
birds
and
because
kay
had
covered
her
face
he
stopped
i
an
ass
it
is
really
you
know
i
just
tell
myself
what
is
it
asked
peter
slightly
awed
for
the
voice
kept
on
singing
the
boy
laughed
the
tiniest
little
river
that
lost
itself
it
creeps
about
under
the
bushes
and
wriggles
through
the
leaves
on
its
tummy
trying
to
find
a
way
does
it
find
it
asked
kay
plucking
up
her
courage
bet
you
wait
till
we
get
to
the
happy
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
got
there
it
was
as
though
the
little
river
had
led
them
for
just
where
they
broke
out
into
the
sunlight
it
rushed
past
them
flashing
silver
and
singing
merrily
with
all
the
words
of
its
song
remembered
at
first
they
saw
a
green
green
stretch
of
grass
over
which
the
yellow
of
cowslips
drifted
like
blown
then
they
saw
friday
lane
with
its
tall
oaks
holding
back
the
woods
like
big
policemen
marshaling
a
crowd
when
a
procession
is
expected
and
then
they
saw
the
happy
cottage
a
with
roof
set
down
in
a
refuge
of
flowers
it
had
one
chimney
from
which
smoke
was
lazily
ascending
and
it
must
be
logs
that
the
fire
was
burning
for
the
air
was
filled
with
the
indescribable
homey
smell
that
sets
one
dreaming
of
all
the
country
cottages
tucked
away
in
gardens
and
all
the
summer
happiness
he
has
ever
chanced
on
they
followed
the
little
stream
right
up
to
the
high
hedge
which
went
about
the
happy
cottage
they
crossed
it
by
a
plank
pushed
open
a
gate
and
entered
flowers
flowers
everywhere
and
the
of
bees
humming
a
path
and
edged
with
box
led
through
a
wilderness
of
beauty
comfortably
untrimmed
and
neglected
the
door
of
the
cottage
stood
open
across
its
threshold
lay
a
great
dane
which
rose
up
and
growled
at
sound
of
their
footsteps
the
boy
called
to
him
right
canute
old
dog
come
here
old
canute
came
with
the
solemn
suspicion
of
majesty
ignoring
the
strangers
and
placed
his
great
head
against
his
master
breast
gazing
up
attentively
this
is
kay
and
this
is
peter
they
my
friends
you
got
to
look
after
them
understand
the
dog
blinked
his
eyes
and
turned
away
indifferently
as
much
as
to
say
friends
humph
we
see
very
sudden
always
like
that
with
newcomers
said
the
boy
very
particular
about
my
brother
guess
he
thinking
what
i
said
that
he
do
let
the
faun
man
know
just
fearful
lest
he
should
have
given
offence
he
made
haste
to
add
you
not
just
anybody
any
the
door
opened
without
ceremony
directly
into
the
the
leaded
windows
were
pushed
back
roses
stared
in
and
bent
inquisitively
across
the
sills
spilling
their
petals
the
house
was
silent
it
was
like
stealing
into
someone
heart
when
the
soul
was
absent
guns
on
the
walls
brilliant
little
sketches
in
a
corner
old
oak
furniture
a
mandolin
lying
in
a
chair
everything
betrayed
the
habitation
by
a
strong
and
alluring
personality
peter
looking
round
became
conscious
of
a
spirit
of
loneliness
and
yearning
on
the
walls
were
pictures
of
many
beautiful
women
but
in
the
house
itself
were
no
signs
of
a
woman
hands
the
boy
explained
not
here
he
gone
to
town
this
is
where
we
play
it
upstairs
that
he
he
volunteered
no
information
concerning
the
task
at
which
the
faun
man
worked
casting
his
eyes
round
the
walls
he
said
are
all
his
girls
pretty
oh
yes
but
they
give
me
an
awful
lot
of
trouble
want
some
tea
yes
he
went
out
into
the
kitchen
at
the
back
he
let
the
children
follow
him
but
refused
their
offers
of
help
a
rare
little
cook
i
can
tell
you
had
to
be
on
our
ranch
in
america
there
was
no
one
else
you
just
watch
but
kay
had
been
thinking
she
had
supposed
that
there
were
mothers
everywhere
that
every
boy
had
a
she
said
are
your
mother
and
sisters
he
looked
up
from
toasting
some
bread
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
but
did
you
ever
have
any
he
answered
cheerfully
not
at
all
sorry
for
himself
not
that
i
she
glanced
at
her
brother
and
i
always
been
peter
added
that
why
you
thought
girls
cried
for
nothing
you
do
know
anything
about
them
i
should
have
been
the
boy
winked
joyfully
do
i
know
anything
leave
that
to
the
faun
man
i
know
just
as
much
as
i
want
to
but
say
i
have
liked
to
have
had
your
sister
for
my
sister
i
really
would
kay
leant
over
his
shoulder
as
he
knelt
before
the
fire
i
were
your
sister
know
what
i
do
for
you
i
tell
you
not
to
climb
trees
and
if
you
did
do
it
i
mend
your
clothes
for
he
told
them
something
of
his
history
as
they
sat
at
table
how
left
england
with
his
brother
when
he
was
so
little
that
he
remember
how
he
lived
on
a
cattle
ranch
and
knew
how
to
ride
anything
he
tried
to
make
them
understand
the
freedom
and
the
solitariness
of
his
life
in
those
wide
stretches
where
there
any
street
lamps
but
only
stars
and
where
one
gazed
on
grass
for
miles
and
never
saw
a
single
house
and
he
told
them
of
the
places
he
had
been
to
the
queerly
natural
ghost
corners
of
the
earth
alaska
mexico
and
the
south
sea
islands
every
now
and
then
his
imagination
would
gallop
away
with
him
then
he
twist
his
head
and
stoop
forward
as
if
listening
for
the
first
expression
of
doubt
before
it
came
he
would
try
to
forestall
it
by
saying
know
that
last
part
not
when
he
had
said
it
several
times
kay
laughed
softly
the
boy
looked
up
a
little
offended
is
it
her
eyes
were
dancing
with
happiness
you
a
very
pretence
person
are
you
peter
and
i
we
pretence
persons
we
always
going
to
one
place
and
telling
ourselves
we
going
somewhere
the
boy
sank
his
head
between
his
hands
his
words
came
timidly
makes
one
happy
to
pretend
especially
when
one
always
been
lonely
it
like
climbing
a
tall
tree
it
belongs
to
anyone
up
he
turned
slowly
staring
at
his
guests
they
wondered
what
was
in
his
mind
at
last
he
said
wish
i
wish
you
call
me
harry
and
please
do
tell
me
where
you
come
from
let
be
pretence
persons
like
to
be
your
with
the
quaint
solemnity
of
childhood
they
clasped
hands
outside
the
bees
played
their
the
flowers
whispered
laying
their
faces
close
together
and
the
stream
ran
singing
past
the
cottage
with
all
the
words
of
its
song
remembered
chapter
xxvi
the
haunted
wood
life
at
its
beginning
and
its
end
is
bounded
by
a
haunted
wood
when
no
one
is
watching
children
creep
back
to
it
to
play
with
the
fairies
and
to
listen
to
the
angels
footsteps
as
the
road
of
their
journey
lengthens
they
return
more
rarely
remembering
less
and
less
they
build
themselves
cities
of
imperative
endeavor
but
at
night
the
wood
comes
marching
to
their
walls
tall
trees
moving
silently
as
clouds
and
little
trees
treading
softly
the
green
host
halts
and
calls
in
the
voice
of
memory
poetry
religion
legend
or
as
the
greeks
put
it
in
the
faint
pipes
and
stampeding
feet
of
pan
we
have
all
heard
it
out
of
fear
of
ridicule
we
do
not
talk
about
it
do
we
revisit
the
wood
it
is
when
sleep
or
the
dream
of
death
has
claimed
us
and
made
us
again
children
because
secrecy
adds
to
happiness
kay
and
peter
told
no
one
of
their
discovery
in
the
early
morning
they
would
tricycle
out
through
suburbs
where
wheeled
fretful
babies
in
prams
and
wondered
what
love
meant
having
spent
their
day
in
fairyland
they
would
tricycle
back
through
those
same
brick
suburbs
where
tethered
people
found
romance
in
twilit
reality
they
almost
feared
to
speak
aloud
of
their
doings
lest
speech
should
break
the
spell
lest
were
they
to
tell
they
might
search
in
vain
for
friday
lane
canute
and
harry
of
the
and
find
them
vanished
on
their
first
visits
they
did
not
meet
the
faun
man
in
proportion
as
they
failed
to
meet
him
they
grew
more
curious
about
him
sometimes
they
were
quite
certain
he
was
there
but
harry
he
was
strangely
reluctant
to
share
him
as
reluctant
as
peter
was
to
share
his
sister
and
yet
the
rest
of
his
secrets
he
was
generous
he
showed
them
how
to
find
beneath
stones
in
the
river
the
homes
of
fishes
tiny
fellows
who
darted
away
with
agitated
tails
the
moment
you
took
the
roofs
off
their
houses
and
he
showed
them
how
you
could
make
whistles
out
of
boughs
if
you
chose
the
right
ones
he
taught
them
to
mimick
the
notes
of
birds
so
that
they
would
follow
through
the
woods
answering
and
hopping
twisting
from
side
to
side
their
perky
heads
he
was
the
pied
piper
of
the
open
world
and
willing
to
make
them
his
confederates
where
did
you
learn
they
asked
him
sometimes
he
looked
away
from
them
narrowing
his
eyes
sometimes
he
answered
faun
man
he
taught
so
the
faun
man
became
a
kind
of
god
whose
handiwork
was
seen
in
many
wonders
but
who
never
showed
himself
it
was
a
scorching
afternoon
in
london
were
going
up
and
down
the
less
refined
portion
of
mankind
had
removed
their
collars
and
had
knotted
handkerchiefs
about
their
necks
along
green
lanes
and
as
far
as
jolly
butcher
hill
costers
tempted
villadom
to
extravagance
crying
fresh
strarberries
in
voices
grown
cracked
from
and
thirst
it
made
one
throat
dry
to
listen
to
them
the
tricycle
seemed
to
feel
its
weight
of
years
despite
frequent
oiling
it
insisted
on
running
heavily
at
aunt
jehane
house
they
halted
for
a
rest
then
on
again
the
country
drowsed
big
trees
in
the
meadows
seemed
to
fold
their
hands
birds
had
hidden
themselves
there
was
scarcely
a
sound
when
they
came
to
the
gate
leading
into
friday
lane
harry
was
there
pushing
the
machine
behind
a
hedge
they
went
in
search
of
him
they
called
his
name
and
paused
to
listen
he
had
tricked
them
before
trying
to
make
them
believe
that
they
would
find
him
then
startling
them
into
laughter
by
playing
his
in
a
tree
right
above
their
heads
they
persuaded
themselves
that
that
was
what
was
happening
now
every
few
steps
they
would
stop
and
look
up
into
the
boughs
shouting
found
you
we
know
where
you
hiding
you
may
as
well
come
if
he
heard
them
he
refused
to
fall
into
their
trap
they
came
to
the
haunted
wood
and
entered
in
its
dark
green
shadows
where
all
things
trod
softly
they
dared
not
shout
they
whispered
their
assertion
that
they
had
guessed
his
whereabouts
only
the
little
river
answered
now
mocking
them
secretly
now
babbling
hoarsely
alarmed
that
it
would
never
get
out
they
began
to
tiptoe
fear
of
the
silence
seized
them
a
branch
cracked
they
only
just
saved
themselves
from
running
it
seemed
as
though
a
magician
had
waved
his
wand
casting
a
spell
everything
slept
everything
except
the
river
and
at
last
because
its
voice
was
solitary
it
became
terrible
like
that
of
a
dying
man
in
a
shuttered
room
who
muttered
deliriously
and
tossed
upon
his
bed
the
green
stretch
of
grass
with
the
cowslips
scattered
over
it
brought
relief
to
their
suspense
but
here
again
there
was
no
welcome
bees
hummed
above
the
flowers
quite
indifferent
to
their
presence
the
cottage
stood
with
door
and
windows
wide
as
though
its
inhabitants
had
been
called
away
suddenly
and
would
never
return
beneath
the
smiling
of
the
summer
stillness
lay
the
threat
that
something
evil
had
happened
even
canute
had
vanished
they
stole
round
the
house
and
at
last
crossed
the
threshold
everything
was
as
they
remembered
it
even
to
the
mandolin
lying
across
the
chair
they
listened
voices
yes
certainly
then
laughter
clear
and
pleasant
it
broke
off
in
the
middle
as
if
someone
paused
for
breath
it
came
from
the
faun
man
room
overhead
which
harry
had
never
invited
them
to
enter
they
climbed
the
stairs
steep
and
narrow
stairs
which
ended
abruptly
in
a
white
door
they
tapped
a
man
answered
peter
raised
the
latch
the
ceiling
sloped
down
from
the
centre
giving
to
the
room
the
appearance
of
a
tent
there
were
two
on
opposite
sides
which
opened
outward
on
to
the
thatch
against
one
of
them
stood
a
desk
littered
with
papers
from
which
a
chair
had
been
pushed
back
a
pen
lying
on
a
sheet
of
partly
written
foolscap
had
rolled
across
it
leaving
blots
as
if
the
writer
had
put
it
down
and
turned
hastily
at
the
sound
of
someone
entrance
in
one
corner
of
the
room
there
was
a
saddle
and
on
the
walls
a
strange
collection
of
memories
and
travel
a
study
of
a
girl
head
by
rossetti
old
indian
muskets
used
in
frontier
warfares
a
pair
of
sabres
a
college
oar
with
the
names
of
the
crew
gilded
on
it
and
everywhere
the
faces
of
women
among
them
one
face
occurred
often
peter
had
noticed
its
frequence
on
the
walls
downstairs
and
now
he
saw
the
living
woman
before
him
she
was
dressed
in
white
lying
on
a
couch
stretched
out
carelessly
with
her
small
feet
crossed
her
age
might
have
been
anywhere
from
twenty
upward
it
did
matter
one
forgot
years
and
only
thought
of
youth
in
looking
at
her
was
not
helen
past
when
two
continents
went
to
war
for
her
beauty
somehow
she
reminded
one
of
helen
was
it
the
way
in
which
experience
mixed
with
artlessness
in
her
expression
the
mind
went
back
faustus
might
have
addressed
his
sonorous
lines
to
her
this
the
face
that
launched
a
thousand
ships
and
burnt
the
topless
towers
of
ilium
sweet
helen
make
me
immortal
with
a
kiss
her
lips
suck
forth
my
soul
see
where
it
flies
come
helen
come
give
me
my
soul
again
here
will
i
dwell
for
heaven
is
in
these
she
was
golden
splendidly
negligent
of
what
was
happening
about
her
insolently
languid
with
a
lazy
ease
that
seemed
to
take
all
the
world
into
her
confidence
and
actually
shut
all
the
world
out
she
was
a
lonely
tower
of
snow
and
ice
rosy
in
the
sunlight
luring
cold
and
inaccessible
her
eyes
were
intensely
blue
and
innocent
she
had
fine
teeth
and
an
almost
childish
mouth
which
was
contradicted
by
the
powerful
molding
of
her
chin
and
throat
and
the
capability
of
her
hands
one
wondered
what
difference
it
would
make
to
her
if
she
were
ever
to
be
roused
by
love
or
anger
she
was
built
on
heroic
lines
long
and
full
and
gracious
yet
she
seemed
to
prefer
to
be
treated
as
a
plaything
one
arm
was
curled
beneath
her
golden
head
the
other
hung
down
listlessly
and
was
held
by
a
man
who
was
pressing
the
hand
to
his
mouth
peter
noticed
in
a
flash
how
the
woman
paid
no
attention
to
what
the
man
was
doing
and
the
man
peter
had
never
seen
anyone
quite
like
him
he
was
tall
and
strong
and
slender
even
though
he
was
kneeling
peter
knew
that
he
must
be
of
great
height
his
face
was
smooth
lean
and
tanned
his
lips
were
thin
unusually
red
and
delicate
for
a
man
his
nose
was
straight
and
arched
at
the
nostrils
his
ears
were
set
far
back
and
pointed
but
it
was
by
his
eyes
that
peter
recognized
him
as
the
faun
man
they
were
brown
and
filmed
over
with
blue
like
a
dog
showing
scarcely
any
white
they
had
a
dumb
appeal
in
them
a
hunger
and
melancholy
because
of
something
which
was
never
found
which
the
eager
happiness
of
the
rest
of
his
appearance
disguised
they
had
a
trick
of
veiling
themselves
of
becoming
dull
and
focusless
as
though
the
spirit
whose
windows
they
were
had
drawn
down
the
blinds
and
lay
drugged
with
sleep
and
satiety
then
suddenly
they
would
flash
become
torches
all
enthusiasm
crying
out
that
there
was
no
truce
in
the
forward
march
of
desire
at
such
times
the
face
became
extremely
young
as
young
as
his
long
fine
hands
only
the
black
hair
brushed
straight
back
from
the
forehead
without
a
parting
betrayed
his
age
by
the
gray
which
grew
about
the
temples
the
golden
woman
withdrew
her
hand
from
his
and
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
at
the
children
entrance
she
gazed
at
them
doubtfully
like
a
young
pantheress
disturbed
her
red
mouth
pouted
her
blue
eyes
feigned
a
laughing
shyness
only
one
small
foot
tapping
against
the
other
told
of
her
impatience
it
is
i
thought
it
was
harry
who
are
they
lorie
her
voice
was
soft
and
caressing
she
spoke
in
the
which
mothers
learn
in
the
nursery
in
her
way
of
talking
there
was
a
guttural
quality
which
marked
her
foreign
parentage
the
faun
man
unabashed
by
the
unexpected
company
bent
toward
her
and
kissed
her
arm
do
know
he
laughed
then
he
turned
with
a
smile
that
was
all
courtesy
and
kindness
you
tell
us
who
are
you
peter
did
answer
at
once
he
was
fascinated
he
had
never
seen
a
man
ears
move
like
that
as
the
faun
man
had
asked
his
question
his
ears
had
pricked
up
as
a
dog
do
when
he
pays
attention
and
then
there
was
something
about
his
voice
it
was
so
sad
and
intense
it
hurt
by
its
longing
it
did
seem
right
to
meet
this
man
in
a
house
peter
both
distrusted
and
liked
him
the
way
we
do
nature
the
white
room
became
a
blur
as
he
gazed
into
the
soft
brown
eyes
woods
and
meadows
seen
distant
in
the
sunlight
became
flat
like
painted
canvases
hung
across
the
windows
real
things
grew
vague
or
took
on
the
aspect
of
artificiality
the
question
came
again
us
little
chap
who
are
you
peter
brain
cleared
you
please
we
friends
of
harry
the
boy
with
the
the
golden
woman
leant
forward
resting
her
hand
intimately
on
the
faun
man
shoulder
she
was
interested
and
her
face
became
gentle
friends
but
we
in
disgrace
with
harry
he
run
away
with
canute
because
because
he
jealous
he
wants
his
big
brother
all
to
himself
what
shall
we
do
with
them
lorie
i
think
we
have
to
make
them
our
kay
had
been
hiding
behind
peter
in
the
doorway
she
looked
round
him
timidly
still
ready
for
escape
but
will
harry
come
back
the
concern
in
her
voice
made
the
woman
clap
her
hands
always
comes
back
men
always
do
come
back
do
they
lorie
she
slipped
her
feet
off
the
couch
and
came
across
the
room
a
dear
little
girl
kay
looked
up
at
her
willing
to
be
frightened
then
her
arms
reached
up
and
the
woman
stooped
over
her
nice
she
said
you
been
here
often
it
was
the
faun
man
speaking
peter
thought
he
tried
to
reckon
often
but
several
the
faun
man
took
him
by
the
shoulders
looking
down
on
him
seen
that
way
from
below
he
seemed
tremendously
high
need
be
afraid
young
i
not
angry
you
wo
get
harry
into
a
row
where
come
from
from
peter
laid
his
fingers
on
the
thin
brown
hand
you
mind
very
much
if
i
did
tell
you
see
harry
does
know
it
such
fun
we
just
pretence
people
we
tricycle

from
from
nowhere
on
a
tandem
kay
and
i
and
then
we
meet
harry
and
leave
the
trike
behind
a
hedge
and
go
into
the
haunted
wood
together
you
see
if
harry
know
who
we
are
it
almost
as
though
we
were
fairies
and
as
though
he
were
a
fairy
and
we
you
know
what
i
mean
we
meet
in
fairyland
and
can
do
what
we
like
with
the
the
faun
man
turned
his
head
did
you
hear
that
he
wants
to
do
what
he
likes
with
the
world
he
one
of
but
eve
had
kay
on
her
lap
and
her
lips
were
in
her
silky
hair
something
had
happened
to
her
something
difficult
to
express
she
had
melted
with
the
child
pressed
against
her
bosom
she
looked
a
mother
very
young
and
good
as
the
faun
man
watched
her
his
eyes
became
tender
oddly
tender
he
went
over
to
her
and
took
her
hand
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
you
had
kept
me
waiting
he
got
no
further
there
was
a
pause
was
thinking
the
same
she
said
yet
yet
he
questioned
she
drew
kay
nearer
to
her
the
good
of
talking
we
talked
so
often
so
he
went
to
the
open
window
and
stared
out
a
butterfly
flew
in
and
alighted
on
his
forehead
he
took
no
notice
he
stood
rigid
like
a
man
of
stone
a
little
muscle
in
his
cheek
kept
twitching
his
arms
hung
straight
down
and
the
fingers
worked
against
the
palms
of
his
hands
seen
on
either
side
of
him
in
two
narrow
strips
was
the
basking
unimprisoned
country
which
rolled
on
marvelously
this
visible
landscape
building
into
the
next
and
the
next
into
all
the
others
that
lay
beyond
the
horizon
continents
seas
and
wonderlands
like
a
carpet
of
pattern
wrapped
about
the
world
for
his
feet
to
tread
and
he
without
bonds
was
a
prisoner
he
swung
round
to
peter
surprise
he
was
laughing
his
dark
face
was
narrow
in
mockery
on
young
he
said
get
he
had
to
double
himself
up
to
pass
down
the
stairway
peter
followed
in
leaving
the
room
he
glanced
back
the
golden
woman
had
raised
her
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
child
who
has
been
selfish
and
has
wounded
itself
she
was
fondling
kay
as
though
she
thought
that
her
kindness
to
the
little
girl
would
atone
for
her
unkindness
to
the
man
as
he
crossed
the
the
faun
man
picked
up
the
mandolin
from
the
chair
he
did
not
walk
through
the
garden
he
walked
into
it
that
was
his
way
with
everything
leaving
the
path
he
pressed
through
roses
and
fuchsias
scattering
their
blooms
and
petals
like
soldiers
approving
his
lawlessness
sunflowers
swayed
their
golden
heads
and
nodded
swarms
of
winged
insects
whose
homes
he
had
disturbed
rose
up
in
busy
protest
his
face
was
wrinkled
with
determination
to
be
glad
to
be
glad
whatever
might
lie
in
the
future
in
the
heart
of
the
fragrant
he
halted
and
sat
down
on
the
earth
he
looked
like
a
great
supple
hound
with
his
legs
crouched
under
him
through
the
walls
of
their
house
of
leaves
and
blossoms
they
could
see
the
window
of
the
room
they
had
left
the
faun
man
commenced
to
tune
his
mandolin
been
in
love
peter
the
boy
reddened
he
did
know
why
he
reddened
perhaps
he
was
proud
that
he
should
be
asked
such
a
question
perhaps
he
was
a
little
angry
because
well
because
everyone
he
had
ever
met
seemed
a
little
ashamed
of
love
everyone
except
the
faun
man
so
he
answered
with
my
little
the
man
laughed
is
what
i
meant
that
different
something
that
burns
and
freezes
it
fills
you
and
leaves
you
hungry
it
makes
you
forget
all
other
affections
and
keeps
you
always
remembering
itself
it
makes
you
kindest
when
it
most
cruel
it
demands
everything
you
possess
and
you
most
eager
to
give
when
it
gives
you
nothing
back
it
hell
and
it
heaven
no
i
tell
you
what
it
is
it
a
small
child
pulling
the
wings
off
a
fly
and
then
crying
because
sorry
and
did
know
what
it
was
doing
ah
peter
peter
you
met
love
he
bent
forward
and
tapped
him
on
the
arm
wise
run
away
when
you
see
love
peter
felt
embarrassed
the
faun
man
closed
one
eye
and
watched
him
watched
how
the
sun
splashed
through
the
creeping
shadows
and
fell
on
the
boy
flushed
face
and
curly
hair
a
little
song
about
love
he
said
very
high
class
song
written
not
improbably
by
the
poet
he
struck
the
strings
of
the
mandolin
playing
a
little
jingling
introduction
and
then
commenced
lifting
his
long
face
to
the
window
in
the
thatch
singing
through
his
nose
and
burlesquing
all
that
had
happened
yer
gal
ai
all
yer
thought
and
fer
everyfing
yer
bought
she
do
seem
to
care
a
pot
o
glue
if
she
tells
yer
she
wo
miss
yer
and
she
does
want
ter
kiss
yer
though
yer
cuddled
from
ter
kew
if
yer
little
side
excurshiums
to
lands
of
pink
nasturtiums
do
make
so
soft
as
they
make
you
why
never
get
for
that
the
way
love
started
adam
ended
wery
and
that
he
had
scarcely
finished
when
the
golden
woman
came
to
the
lattice
in
the
thatch
she
stood
framed
there
with
the
whiteness
of
the
room
as
a
background
her
hands
were
crossed
upon
her
breast
the
shining
masses
wrapped
about
her
head
and
forehead
accentuated
her
vivid
paleness
she
looked
as
idealized
as
a
girl
on
canvas
put
there
by
her
lover
in
a
bid
for
immortality
she
glanced
this
way
and
that
to
discover
the
faun
man
she
leant
out
listening
and
searching
she
could
not
detect
him
she
cried
addressing
the
garden
unkind
i
hate
you
when
you
she
waited
for
him
to
answer
nothing
but
silence
and
the
little
river
whispering
to
itself
beyond
the
hedge
i
suppose
you
think
i
got
no
right
to
talk
about
being
flippant
because
but
i
not
flippant
i
like
you
and
but
i
ca
help
myself
if
god
made
me
as
i
again
she
waited
i
be
awfully
nice
to
you
if
you
only
show
yourself
i
do
so
want
to
see
the
faun
man
stood
up
ecstatically
with
his
arms
stretched
out
to
her
it
was
absurd
to
call
him
a
man
the
pollen
of
flowers
had
smirched
his
face
and
hands
his
head
was
bare
and
the
hair
had
fallen
forward
over
his
forehead
crying
for
the
moon
he
chanted
because
she
wo
come
down
to
me
i
calling
her
names
saying
that
she
a
gorgonzola
cheese
flying
through
the
lord
laughed
the
golden
woman
she
pronounced
it
looard
in
her
most
foreign
accent
an
imagination
you
have
down
urged
the
faun
man
catch
you
little
eve
i
catch
you
and
carry
you
she
thought
and
slowly
shook
her
head
as
if
she
had
been
considering
his
suggestion
as
a
feasible
if
unconventional
plan
of
descent
rather
trust
the
rather
trust
anything
than
trust
me
he
said
ruefully
i
do
care
so
long
as
you
do
come
she
was
leaving
the
window
when
she
turned
back
was
that
silly
song
you
were
singing
he
answered
her
promptly
by
shelley
accompanied
by
lorenzo
arran
title
bloke
and
scene
laid
in
london
all
rights
she
pulled
a
face
exceedingly
provocative
and
naughty
by
shelley
indeed
but
i
can
believe
all
the
she
vanished
the
faun
man
turned
to
peter
see
young
fellow
it
as
i
told
you
love
always
like
that
it
comes
to
a
window
and
looks
down
at
you
you
hold
out
your
arms
to
it
and
say
i
want
you
love
came
to
the
window
that
you
might
say
that
but
the
moment
you
say
it
love
shakes
its
head
if
you
told
it
to
walk
decently
down
the
stairs
to
you
it
would
immediately
fling
itself
over
the
sill
and
toboggan
down
the
thatch
you
fool
enough
to
say
to
it
down
the
thatch
and
it
immediately
walks
decently
down
the
stairs
if
i
were
you
peter
never
fall
in
love
with
then
peter
surprised
himself
he
mimicked
something
he
had
just
heard
looard
he
said
never
going
the
faun
man
held
his
sides
and
threw
back
his
head
laughing
loudly
that
was
how
the
golden
woman
found
him
when
she
came
with
her
arm
about
kay
neck
she
halted
on
the
path
six
feet
away
smiling
at
him
across
the
barricade
of
flowers
she
cuddled
the
little
girl
closer
to
her
men
funny
kay
and
then
slanting
her
face
and
stooping
with
her
neck
you
queer
boy
what
the
matter
now
the
faun
man
waded
through
the
roses
to
her
catching
her
by
the
shoulders
and
bending
over
her
the
matter
i
was
telling
him
never
to
fall
in
love
with
anybody
because
well
because
love
cruel
and
only
looks
out
of
a
window
in
order
to
go
away
and
leave
the
window
vacant
and
what
think
he
said
i
never
going
to
he
said
it
sharply
like
that
as
if
i
been
telling
him
never
to
be
a
pickpocket
fancy
a
little
boy
having
made
up
his
mind
never
to
walk
in
the
sunlight
because
the
sunlight
but
he
did
not
mean
she
spoke
as
though
peter
had
been
unkind
and
had
said
that
he
would
not
love
her
he
did
not
mean
it
she
repeated
tilting
peter
face
up
in
her
hollowed
hand
love
cruel
he
must
believe
what
lorie
says
love
is
the
flowers
and
the
dusk
falling
and
the
sound
of
birds
and
rivers
and
the
dearness
of
little
children
love
is
how
shall
i
put
it
love
is
eyes
in
the
head
without
love
one
can
see
peter
gazed
into
her
eyes
she
was
charming
he
felt
as
though
he
had
hurt
her
and
he
felt
that
if
he
had
hurt
her
he
ought
to
go
all
across
the
world
on
his
knees
and
hands
till
he
obtained
her
forgiveness
he
remembered
afterward
that
when
her
eyes
were
on
his
he
saw
nothing
but
blue
just
her
eyes
and
nothing
else
did
mean
it
did
he
she
coaxed
in
a
very
small
voice
he
answered
did
mean
it
you
see
there
kay
i
have
to
love
some
man
may
love
kay
presently
may
take
her
away
from
you
what
then
peter
had
never
thought
of
that
he
would
think
of
it
now
just
as
years
later
he
refused
to
face
up
to
it
would
never
allow
anyone
to
take
her
would
you
kay
kay
shook
her
head
only
want
she
freed
herself
from
the
golden
woman
and
went
and
stood
beside
her
brother
with
her
arm
about
him
an
arm
so
small
that
it
would
come
all
the
way
round
the
man
and
woman
stared
at
them
here
was
something
outside
their
experience
they
had
found
hard
knocks
in
the
world
and
occasional
stolen
glimpses
of
tenderness
not
a
tenderness
which
one
could
carry
about
as
a
thing
expected
could
arrange
life
by
and
refer
to
as
to
a
timepiece
in
the
pocket
both
were
conscious
of
a
hollowness
in
their
living
and
the
woman
she
had
dreaded
permanency
in
affection
lest
it
should
become
a
chain
to
gall
her
a
shadowy
hurdler
very
distant
as
yet
over
trees
and
fields
and
hedges
evening
came
vaulting
no
one
could
hear
his
footsteps
only
the
panting
of
his
breath
he
was
racing
from
the
great
red
door
in
the
west
from
which
he
had
slipped
out
racing
with
his
head
turned
across
his
shoulder
as
though
he
feared
to
see
a
presence
on
the
burning
threshold
and
to
hear
a
voice
that
would
call
him
the
small
applauding
hands
of
leaves
moved
gently
the
red
door
sank
lower
snared
in
the
branches
of
the
haunted
wood
it
came
to
rest
far
away
and
out
of
sight
and
mellow
came
the
lowing
of
cattle
and
the
staccato
barking
of
a
dog
driving
the
herd
to
the
milking
one
by
one
live
things
of
the
commenced
to
wake
and
stir
rabbits
hopped
out
among
the
cowslips
and
nibbled
at
the
turf
birds
like
children
put
to
bed
and
frightened
of
being
left
called
over
and
over
from
of
tall
trees
answered
the
world
had
become
maternal
the
spirit
of
brevity
of
parting
of
remembrance
of
regret
of
happiness
withheld
was
in
the
air
the
golden
woman
felt
her
loneliness
looking
at
the
children
so
defiant
in
their
sureness
of
one
another
she
recalled
her
lost
opportunities
an
arm
stole
about
her
a
brown
hand
covered
hers
she
leant
back
her
head
so
that
it
lay
against
the
faun
man
jacket
so
many
things
seemed
worth
the
seeking
in
this
world
so
few
worth
the
keeping
when
found
for
the
moment
she
liked
to
fancy
that
her
search
was
at
an
end
peter
spoke
you
please
i
think
we
must
be
going
i
got
to
get
kay
back
you
know
even
now
i
have
to
light
the
but
we
have
seen
a
light
woke
in
the
golden
woman
eyes
she
was
about
to
speak
the
faun
man
pressed
his
hand
against
her
mouth
can
see
him
little
girl
if
peter
will
bring
where
is
he
the
faun
man
swept
the
horizon
over
there
he
gone
away
into
the
wood
with
canute
because
we
hurt
his
what
he
doing
kay
insisted
the
faun
man
looked
at
the
golden
woman
his
eyes
asked
we
tell
they
turned
back
to
kay
he
doing
sitting
with
his
head
in
his
hands
crying
perhaps
do
boys
cry
peter
he
does
like
his
brother
and
this
little
woman
to
be
together
the
poor
old
chap
does
think
we
do
each
other
any
do
we
the
golden
woman
spoke
softly
the
faun
man
became
very
solemn
his
voice
was
husky
do
but
we
she
twisted
round
in
his
embrace
so
that
she
met
him
breast
to
breast
there
the
voice
of
every
tragedy
we
do
but
we
could
and
we
know
we
could
and
yet
we
down
the
garden
over
the
across
the
meadow
through
the
haunted
wood
they
went
together
the
boy
and
girl
like
lovers
with
arms
encircling
the
man
and
woman
like
brother
and
sister
holding
hands
brushing
shoulders
and
following
as
they
entered
into
friday
lane
kay
looked
back
at
the
foot
of
a
big
oak
canute
was
lying
his
nose
between
his
his
eyes
with
vigilance
she
tugged
on
peter
arm
he
must
be
up
there
oh
do
let
be
nice
to
him
just
one
minute
but
when
they
approached
the
dog
back
bristled
and
he
growled
he
lifted
his
black
lip
showing
the
whiteness
of
his
fangs
his
sullen
eyes
were
on
the
golden
woman
like
one
embittered
who
had
ceased
to
believe
that
virtue
could
be
found
anywhere
he
regarded
all
four
of
them
in
anger
the
faun
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
climbs
trees
that
means
he
getting
better
there
no
sense
in
worrying
him
he
wo
come
down
till
he
kay
called
to
him
with
piping
shrillness
called
peter
and
again
when
the
tree
was
growing
small
in
the
distance
kay
shouted
harry
we
missed
from
up
in
the
clouds
very
faint
and
little
came
the
sound
of
a
playing
the
of
romance
been
off
patagonia
home
and
colonia
antipodonia
i
shot
cannibals
animals
coons
i
bought
diamonds
their
memories
set
the
tune
to
words
the
old
tandem
trike
was
trundled
out
from
its
hiding
place
behind
the
hedge
the
faun
man
lifted
kay
on
to
her
seat
at
the
back
peter
mounted
all
was
ready
you
riding
away
from
fairyland
sighed
the
golden
woman
foolish
it
so
easy
to
do
that
and
when
you
gone
and
until
you
come
again
there
wo
be
any
fairyland
it
so
easy
to
ride
away
so
difficult
to
come
kay
thought
that
a
doubt
was
being
cast
on
peter
cleverness
difficult
at
all
she
protested
if
you
have
a
tandem
tricycle
and
a
big
brother
like
the
golden
woman
laughed
with
her
hand
against
her
throat
i
a
tandem
tricycle
and
i
a
big
brother
like
kay
knew
she
had
she
wondered
what
made
the
golden
woman
say
that
and
yes
why
she
choked
at
the
end
of
her
words
till
we
come
they
rang
their
bells
as
a
parting
salutation
the
wheels
began
to
turn
they
disappeared
between
the
hedges
down
the
road
a
vision
of
plunging
legs
bent
backs
and
flying
hair
the
man
and
woman
were
left
alone
on
the
highway
between
the
haunted
wood
and
the
town
to
both
of
which
these
children
had
such
ready
access
slowly
slowly
the
sun
was
vanishing
once
a
ball
of
fire
now
the
boldness
of
sight
on
which
an
was
closing
at
last
a
glory
to
be
taken
on
faith
and
conjecture
the
country
became
vague
as
though
seen
through
water
its
greenness
had
a
coolness
which
was
more
than
color
which
had
to
be
realized
by
a
spiritual
sense
the
evening
dimness
like
the
hand
of
death
removed
sharp
temporary
edges
from
the
landscape
and
revealed
an
expression
which
was
timeless
which
had
been
always
there
birds
had
ceased
calling
the
moon
floated
out
the
soul
of
the
night
and
inspired
trees
sought
to
touch
her
with
their
fingers
she
slipped
by
them
unhurried
by
their
effort
he
had
said
so
much
to
her
in
the
past
with
his
eager
lips
and
words
now
for
some
time
he
had
been
saying
everything
while
seeming
to
say
nothing
he
held
her
pressed
against
him
dearest
she
stirred
i
not
are
but
you
not
kind
to
me
often
she
murmured
he
stooped
in
the
darkness
he
could
say
it
the
old
old
question
which
through
repetition
had
lost
its
generosity
and
splendor
i
never
going
to
make
you
love
me
she
turned
her
face
away
so
that
his
kiss
fell
on
her
neck
know
do
know
lorie
how
should
i
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
you
do
believe
me
when
i
say
that
but
i
fickle
i
not
at
all
what
you
think
me
i
all
wrong
somewhere
inside
cold
and
he
laid
his
cheek
against
hers
holding
her
more
tightly
eve
please
you
sha
accuse
yourself
it
she
broke
away
but
only
that
she
might
return
of
herself
she
caught
him
by
the
lapels
of
his
coat
and
tiptoed
against
him
i
am
harry
quite
right
to
hate
me
i
send
you
on
long
journeys
and
you
ca
forget
me
i
wo
love
you
myself
and
i
keep
you
from
loving
another
woman
you
offer
me
your
soul
and
i
allow
you
to
go
thirsty
i
torture
you
and
give
you
he
spoke
very
gently
for
the
first
time
honest
can
put
it
in
fewer
words
you
want
to
be
loved
you
wo
pay
the
price
of
loving
that
it
she
pressed
her
golden
head
against
his
shoulder
in
ashamed
assent
behind
her
shuttered
eyes
she
had
the
vision
of
a
long
white
road
leading
up
to
a
city
of
a
boy
and
an
steering
through
the
traffic
beneath
street
lamps
she
wanted
to
have
the
palm
without
the
dust
to
be
a
mother
without
the
sacrifice
of
having
children
seeing
the
vision
of
children
going
from
her
and
knowing
that
he
would
understand
she
whispered
day
i
shall
be
old
and
i
shall
have
missed
all
little
eve
poor
little
girl
he
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
and
commenced
to
walk
through
the
twilight
across
fields
to
the
cottage
she
raised
her
hand
and
touched
his
cheek
wonderful
strong
faun
he
halted
in
his
stride
and
bent
over
her
then
went
on
into
the
shadows
chapter
xxvii
peter
finds
a
fairy
at
the
faun
man
birth
an
angel
and
a
witch
attended
the
angel
brought
him
the
supreme
gift
of
making
people
love
him
the
witch
made
the
gift
fatal
by
wishing
that
he
might
be
loved
not
as
a
man
but
as
a
woman
is
loved
with
jealousy
so
his
friends
were
all
enemies
to
each
other
because
they
had
to
share
him
even
canute
was
like
that
he
had
to
be
chained
when
admirers
were
calling
strange
company
invaded
the
happy
cottage
women
predominated
women
who
tried
to
treat
the
faun
man
as
their
property
they
wore
fluffy
gowns
and
had
fluffy
manners
even
their
voices
were
fluffy
their
attitude
was
that
of
princesses
who
had
journeyed
into
the
wilderness
to
borrow
something
they
were
a
little
annoyed
by
the
country
and
found
it
dirty
very
few
of
them
addressed
him
as
arran
each
invented
a
for
him
which
seemed
to
make
him
hers
peculiarly
they
were
all
consumed
with
a
desire
to
touch
him
and
to
go
on
touching
him
beating
about
him
like
birds
about
a
lighthouse
which
shines
out
hospitably
but
permits
no
entrance
most
of
them
mingled
with
their
admiration
a
concerned
and
respectful
sorrow
his
lonely
manner
of
living
moved
them
to
the
depths
they
formed
individual
and
brilliant
plans
for
the
glorious
reconstruction
of
his
future
plans
which
these
female
geographers
handed
to
him
boastfully
as
though
they
were
maps
of
fascinating
lands
which
awaited
his
exploring
for
satisfactory
exploration
the
presence
of
the
female
geographer
was
necessary
peter
was
usually
forewarned
that
an
invasion
was
in
progress
by
the
crescendo
cackling
which
rushed
out
from
doors
and
windows
into
the
basking
stillness
of
the
garden
then
he
would
hear
the
mild
protest
of
the
faun
man
my
dear
lady
my
dear
lady
but
really
harry
would
meet
him
by
the
hedge
his
face
flushed
and
his
mouth
sulky
jerking
his
thumb
across
his
shoulder
he
would
whisper
hissing
geese
hark
at
ai
it
sickening
sometimes
he
call
them
the
for
brevity
he
called
them
that
because
of
the
way
in
which
they
sat
round
his
brother
with
their
necks
stretched
out
all
making
sounds
he
hated
them
unreasonably
and
hated
them
to
excess
when
they
tried
to
curry
favor
with
him
by
kissing
and
yet
it
was
silly
of
him
with
a
few
years
added
to
his
age
he
would
have
found
most
of
them
pretty
and
quite
suitable
for
loving
surliness
on
these
occasions
gave
harry
a
strong
sympathy
for
canute
if
he
had
been
a
dog
and
unrestrained
by
chivalry
nothing
would
have
pleased
him
better
than
to
have
bitten
the
ladies
legs
he
felt
that
it
was
unjust
to
chain
canute
up
as
a
reward
for
his
loyalty
so
usually
when
kay
and
peter
had
arrived
the
three
of
them
would
sneak
round
the
cottage
to
the
kennel
and
attempt
a
rescue
then
came
the
exciting
escape
through
the
garden
crouching
low
and
stealing
behind
the
flowers
so
as
not
to
be
observed
holding
on
to
the
collar
of
the
great
dane
for
fear
he
should
break
away
and
glut
his
anger
sometimes
they
were
heard
above
the
rattle
of
and
the
ladies
would
bunch
themselves
in
the
cottage
window
like
a
nosegay
with
the
faun
man
in
their
centre
then
would
follow
a
series
of
questions
and
exclamations
fired
off
for
the
sake
of
noise
dear
children
is
that
your
sister
are
they
both
your
brothers
what
a
perfectly
sweet
dog
the
sweet
would
growl
and
show
his
fangs
as
much
as
to
say
me
out
of
it
look
after
your
legs
i
wish
i
had
half
a
chance
of
showing
you
how
perfectly
sweet
i
where
did
they
all
come
from
these
amorous
butterfly
excursionists
harry
kept
his
mouth
shut
he
was
going
to
tell
only
well
he
hinted
that
they
might
be
insincere
experiments
of
the
golden
woman
sent
to
supplant
her
sent
because
she
knew
they
could
do
it
jolly
good
care
she
takes
not
to
send
the
right
one
trust
harry
said
it
in
a
growl
which
he
copied
from
canute
it
was
until
they
had
entered
the
haunted
wood
and
the
green
wall
of
bushes
and
had
shut
out
intruders
that
his
ruffled
spirit
regained
its
levity
then
he
light
a
fire
and
play
at
indians
who
had
taken
their
revenge
in
scalps
presently
if
the
faun
man
had
been
lucky
in
getting
rid
of
his
worries
he
would
join
them
they
would
boil
a
kettle
and
have
tea
in
the
open
after
which
the
faun
man
would
light
his
pipe
and
smoke
it
lying
flat
on
his
back
they
knew
what
to
expect
soon
he
would
sit
up
press
his
tobacco
down
with
a
lean
finger
pluck
a
twig
out
of
the
fire
and
use
it
as
a
match
then
very
deliberately
he
would
begin
remember
once
upon
a
what
a
lot
of
magnificent
things
had
happened
once
upon
a
time
that
he
could
remember
he
had
chased
cattle
thieves
across
the
border
and
had
come
up
with
them
intending
to
shoot
if
necessary
only
to
find
them
such
human
fellows
that
he
parted
friends
was
his
word
for
describing
the
kind
of
people
he
liked
many
of
whom
were
disreputable
one
night
when
camping
in
the
canadian
rockies
a
hundred
miles
from
anywhere
a
stranger
had
crept
from
the
forest
and
shared
his
supper
and
blanket
they
had
talked
of
london
london
and
leicester
square
till
the
stars
were
going
out
next
morning
he
was
wakened
by
a
member
of
the
north
west
mounted
police
who
was
hunting
a
murderer
the
fugitive
had
already
vanished
pity
he
killed
some
one
said
the
faun
man
was
one
of
the
most
charmin
chaps
i
ever
met
oh
yes
he
was
caught
and
the
faun
man
had
played
with
death
in
many
quaint
corners
of
the
world
getting
his
into
whack
he
called
it
and
gathering
what
local
color
might
be
and
why
anyone
should
want
to
gather
it
peter
did
understand
but
he
learnt
that
its
gathering
took
you
down
into
mexico
in
search
of
secret
gold
where
indians
hid
behind
rocks
and
potted
at
you
with
poisoned
arrows
and
that
it
took
you
up
to
fort
mackenzie
with
dogs
to
the
very
edge
of
the
arctic
while
he
listened
to
these
stories
of
adventure
the
shadows
of
the
haunted
wood
lengthened
the
river
sang
more
boldly
evening
fell
and
the
fire
from
a
pyramid
of
leaping
flames
became
a
hollow
land
of
scarlet
which
grew
slowly
gray
fluttering
with
little
tufts
of
ashen
moss
and
ashen
feathers
until
it
at
last
lay
charred
and
dead
the
faun
man
captured
peter
imagination
and
affections
he
filled
him
with
strange
new
longings
he
sent
his
spirit
reaching
out
after
unattainable
perfections
whose
lure
and
desire
are
both
the
glamour
and
torture
of
childhood
he
made
peter
want
to
be
a
man
so
that
he
might
be
like
him
the
faun
man
was
a
window
which
when
looked
through
tinted
and
intensified
life
values
peter
was
going
through
the
experience
of
which
comes
to
most
boys
when
sex
is
dawning
and
they
have
not
yet
realized
that
its
sole
and
splendid
meaning
is
that
woman
shares
the
same
world
and
yet
there
were
moments
when
peter
almost
feared
his
friend
his
character
was
a
in
which
the
track
followed
yesterday
was
soon
wiped
out
one
day
he
would
cry
i
know
him
and
the
next
know
the
whole
passionate
urgency
of
a
child
heart
in
friendship
is
to
know
everything
but
the
faun
man
was
too
big
and
elusive
to
be
known
by
one
person
four
walls
could
not
contain
him
he
came
into
a
house
like
a
animal
but
where
had
he
been
where
had
he
come
from
he
had
tricks
curious
tricks
which
linked
him
to
the
creatures
which
make
their
homes
in
the
leaves
and
holes
of
the
earth
he
seldom
sat
on
chairs
but
huddled
himself
on
the
floor
while
he
talked
to
you
he
could
sit
for
an
hour
saying
nothing
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation
he
would
jump
up
and
go
out
without
apology
as
if
he
heard
a
voice
which
you
had
not
heard
and
he
had
the
sound
of
the
wind
told
him
something
the
altered
note
of
a
thrush
the
little
shudder
scarcely
perceptible
that
ran
through
the
flowers
to
him
they
all
said
something
if
you
asked
him
what
they
said
he
could
not
tell
you
so
it
was
no
good
wanting
him
to
belong
to
you
he
belonged
out
there
to
peter
who
had
always
been
smiled
at
for
his
compassion
it
was
comforting
to
find
some
one
as
compassionate
as
himself
it
removed
the
dread
of
abnormality
there
was
a
nightingale
which
used
to
come
every
evening
to
sing
in
an
near
the
happy
cottage
they
used
to
wait
for
the
romance
of
its
silver
voice
slanting
across
the
velvet
dusk
as
though
it
were
a
thing
to
be
seen
rather
than
heard
one
night
they
waited
it
did
not
come
the
faun
man
grew
nervous
he
could
not
rest
at
last
he
went
in
search
of
it
with
peter
beneath
the
they
found
it
still
warm
with
its
wings
stretched
out
and
then
the
unexpected
happened
kneeling
in
the
twilight
beside
the
dead
singer
as
though
music
had
departed
forever
from
the
earth
the
faun
man
wept
and
yet
the
same
man
could
be
harsh
in
anger
that
was
how
peter
found
the
fairy
on
entering
the
cottage
one
afternoon
he
heard
the
sound
of
sobbing
upstairs
and
a
voice
protesting
did
mean
to
do
it
she
drove
me
mad
you
and
she
together
you
do
care
for
me
do
care
for
me
and
i
love
you
better
than
anything
in
the
world
oh
do
forgive
me
kind
faun
a
pause
peter
knew
she
was
on
her
knees
before
him
kissing
his
hands
it
was
as
though
he
could
see
her
doing
it
you
did
mean
to
do
it
it
was
the
faun
man
speaking
deliberately
and
coldly
did
it
on
purpose
it
was
stupid
and
babyish
of
you
it
did
do
her
any
harm
and
it
did
do
you
any
good
i
do
want
to
see
you
and
i
do
like
you
any
a
passionate
voice
declared
you
say
that
again
i
kill
again
a
pause
the
door
overhead
opened
a
wild
thing
came
tearing
down
the
stairs
peter
had
a
vision
of
something
in
skirts
something
with
an
intense
white
face
tragic
gray
eyes
and
a
mass
of
black
flying
hair
he
was
bumped
into
in
stepping
backward
he
tripped
against
a
chair
when
he
picked
himself
up
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
she
had
disappeared
all
he
heard
was
the
running
of
her
swift
feet
growing
fainter
and
fainter
he
gazed
about
the
room
wondering
what
he
ought
to
do
should
he
steal
back
quietly
to
where
he
had
left
kay
and
harry
and
pretend
that
he
had
seen
nothing
his
attention
was
arrested
so
that
was
what
had
caused
the
disturbance
every
portrait
of
the
golden
woman
had
been
torn
from
its
place
on
the
wall
and
trampled
while
he
hesitated
he
heard
the
faun
man
descending
it
was
too
late
to
go
now
the
faun
man
entered
without
seeing
him
his
face
was
stern
two
deep
lines
stretched
like
cuts
from
the
nostrils
to
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
looked
leaner
than
ever
he
was
already
stooping
over
the
ruined
portraits
when
peter
addressed
him
you
ever
forgive
her
please
do
never
to
forgive
a
person
not
forever
and
forever
seems
so
the
faun
man
jumped
his
eyes
when
they
turned
on
peter
were
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
where
did
you
come
from
and
who
asked
you
for
your
opinion
you
better
get
when
he
came
to
the
plank
which
crossed
the
little
river
peter
halted
down
friday
lane
he
could
hear
the
and
looking
could
see
harry
beating
time
with
one
hand
while
kay
danced
to
it
no
he
want
to
join
them
harry
would
laugh
at
him
for
paying
heed
to
one
of
the
faun
man
moods
and
kay
why
if
she
guessed
that
he
was
unhappy
of
course
she
become
unhappy
too
and
that
girl
she
said
that
she
was
going
to
kill
herself
he
ran
across
the
meadow
to
the
haunted
wood
she
must
be
there
she
should
do
it
just
where
he
entered
he
stooped
and
picked
up
something
white
she
had
dropped
her
handkerchief
so
he
knew
that
he
was
on
the
right
track
he
followed
on
tiptoe
afraid
lest
if
he
overtook
her
suddenly
he
might
scare
her
in
the
stealth
of
the
pursuit
a
novel
excitement
came
upon
him
his
eyes
were
glowing
his
breath
came
and
went
pantingly
he
had
removed
his
cap
his
curly
hair
lay
ruffled
on
his
forehead
he
went
forward
timidly
to
turn
back
ashamed
lest
he
might
find
her
looking
at
him
as
he
penetrated
deeper
the
stillness
grew
and
magnified
ievery
sound
overhead
the
branches
were
woven
closer
together
shutting
the
sunlight
out
an
air
of
secrecy
gathered
round
him
birds
hopping
out
of
his
path
under
bushes
looked
back
at
him
knowingly
they
knew
what
he
did
not
know
himself
out
of
sight
beyond
him
there
was
the
sound
of
moving
leaves
rustled
silence
settled
down
they
rustled
again
he
followed
then
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
river
a
little
voice
which
grew
louder
it
sang
to
itself
softly
it
seemed
to
be
trying
to
say
something
did
it
sing
in
lurement
or
warning
now
it
seemed
to
be
saying
back
turn
back
turn
and
now
but
he
could
make
out
the
words
he
lifted
his
face
above
a
clump
of
and
found
his
eyes
peering
into
hers
she
was
too
startled
to
jump
back
from
him
she
gazed
with
lips
parted
and
one
hand
plucking
at
her
breast
she
saw
a
boy
swift
and
straight
as
an
arrow
a
boy
who
seemed
to
stand
tiptoe
with
eagerness
who
had
the
grace
and
strength
of
a
greek
runner
and
the
smooth
skin
and
gentle
mouth
of
a
girl
and
peter
in
looking
at
her
saw
a
white
face
sensitive
as
a
flower
and
a
mouth
red
as
a
cherry
long
and
drooping
and
curved
and
two
great
gray
eyes
clear
and
wistful
in
expression
and
over
the
eyes
dark
brows
like
a
bird
wings
spread
for
flight
her
black
hair
had
broken
loose
and
hung
about
her
shoulders
giving
her
a
touch
of
wildness
across
the
whiteness
of
her
forehead
it
brooded
like
a
cloud
in
the
green
church
of
the
wood
she
seemed
sacred
to
peter
she
laughed
throatily
breaking
the
suspense
it
only
peter
stepped
out
of
the
underbrush
then
he
saw
that
she
had
removed
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
little
river
her
feet
were
wet
and
as
small
as
her
hands
they
looked
cold
as
marble
in
the
green
dusk
why
was
it
more
than
anything
else
the
sight
of
her
feet
made
him
unhappy
for
her
made
him
want
to
care
for
her
made
him
want
to
bring
a
smile
to
her
mouth
it
only
me
he
said
but
i
wish
it
was
i
she
tossed
her
head
as
though
she
were
indignant
with
him
for
being
sorry
but
she
looked
at
him
slantingly
curiously
and
kindly
should
you
be
sorry
you
do
know
who
i
am
you
not
sorry
you
only
say
he
protested
i
am
i
did
mean
to
overhear
but
you
know
i
heard
what
you
said
i
was
afraid
you
do
she
sat
down
trailing
her
feet
in
the
water
she
was
smiling
now
secretly
and
to
herself
as
if
she
did
want
him
to
know
it
too
little
she
pouted
could
drown
in
peter
seated
himself
at
her
side
with
his
knees
drawn
up
to
his
chin
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
an
air
of
grave
confession
awfully
glad
it
was
too
she
turned
her
head
looking
at
him
from
under
her
long
lashes
provocatively
but
he
was
staring
straight
before
him
with
vacant
eyes
as
if
something
very
sweet
and
awful
were
happening
she
reached
out
her
hand
and
touched
him
she
noticed
how
he
trembled
if
it
been
too
little
it
would
have
mattered
not
to
he
did
answer
her
immediately
when
he
spoke
it
was
slowly
as
if
each
word
hurt
as
he
dragged
it
out
would
have
mattered
because
then
you
would
have
been
in
the
you
did
know
that
i
was
in
the
world
this
he
shook
his
head
as
much
as
to
tell
her
that
her
objection
was
quite
beside
the
question
know
that
but
i
think
i
should
have
missed
you
just
the
same
without
knowing
exactly
what
i
was
she
laughed
outright
swaying
against
him
and
burying
her
hands
in
the
green
things
growing
are
funny
yes
and
dear
i
never
met
a
boy
like
you
you
did
really
think
he
gazed
at
her
wonderingly
each
time
he
looked
at
her
he
found
something
new
that
was
beautiful
it
was
her
throat
this
time
long
and
delicate
like
a
lent
lily
as
he
watched
it
he
could
see
how
the
laughter
bubbled
up
inside
it
he
longed
with
the
instinct
of
a
child
to
lay
his
fingers
on
it
did
really
think
he
nodded
you
were
going
to
kill
yourself
yes
and
were
you
she
ceased
laughing
do
think
so
i
such
a
coward
and
then
she
commenced
laughing
again
yourself
is
such
a
worry
you
can
only
do
it
once
and
if
you
not
careful
you
do
look
pretty
i
always
want
to
look
pretty
do
do
you
think
i
pretty
he
choked
and
swallowed
his
mouth
was
dry
he
could
bring
his
voice
to
the
surface
she
drooped
her
face
away
from
him
pretending
to
take
offense
do
i
can
see
that
you
need
tell
his
words
came
with
a
rush
do
i
do
i
think
when
god
made
you
he
must
have
said
to
himself
make
the
most
beautiful
person
the
most
beautiful
person
i
ever
made
it
was
something
like
that
he
his
quivering
earnestness
made
her
solemn
she
had
meant
to
stir
him
so
deeply
an
odd
way
of
saying
things
you
have
i
do
suppose
god
cared
much
about
my
making
he
just
had
me
manufactured
with
the
a
warm
hand
slipped
into
hers
and
a
shy
voice
whispered
made
you
himself
i
she
gazed
at
him
at
the
narrow
sloping
shoulders
and
the
shining
curly
head
she
felt
very
much
a
woman
at
the
moment
years
older
than
the
handful
of
months
which
at
most
must
separate
them
she
laid
her
cheek
against
his
and
slid
her
arm
about
him
so
glad
you
not
a
he
stared
straight
before
him
shall
be
old
are
you
next
she
drew
him
nearer
to
her
he
was
so
young
as
that
old
think
i
am
he
searched
her
face
trying
to
make
her
as
near
his
own
age
as
possible
and
not
to
be
mistaken
he
suggested
seventeen
she
said
soon
be
twenty
and
then
then
he
interrupted
be
eighteen
almost
a
she
withdrew
her
face
from
his
i
do
want
you
to
be
a
man
when
you
a
man
i
sha
like
you
you
become
hard
and
masterful
like
like
the
she
relented
i
do
think
you
will
but
then
it
be
all
yes
it
would
all
be
different
peter
had
been
a
child
when
in
the
early
summer
he
had
stumbled
on
the
happy
cottage
until
then
he
would
have
been
perfectly
contented
to
have
gone
on
living
at
topbury
and
to
have
been
fifteen
forever
it
had
scarcely
occurred
to
him
that
childhood
was
a
preparation
which
would
soon
be
ended
he
had
never
looked
ahead
never
realized
that
he
with
all
the
generations
of
boys
who
had
lived
before
him
must
one
day
be
a
man
in
a
vague
way
he
had
known
that
once
his
father
and
mother
had
been
young
and
protected
as
he
and
kay
were
young
and
protected
but
it
had
seemed
a
fanciful
legend
and
now
the
great
change
which
formerly
he
would
have
dreaded
he
yearned
for
the
ignorance
and
inexperience
of
being
young
the
habit
grown
people
had
of
treating
him
as
a
person
of
no
serious
importance
galled
him
it
had
begun
with
the
faun
man
and
his
desire
to
be
like
him
it
was
ridiculous
when
he
imagined
his
own
appearance
but
he
wanted
to
be
respected
these
longings
had
not
come
home
to
him
before
they
had
been
a
gradual
growth
of
weeks
and
months
it
was
contact
with
a
vitalizing
personality
that
had
done
it
and
listening
to
talks
of
strange
lands
and
the
doings
of
strong
men
and
now
this
girl
to
her
he
was
no
more
than
amusing
she
could
do
and
say
to
him
things
that
she
would
never
do
or
say
to
men
yes
when
he
was
older
it
would
all
be
different
she
had
wakened
him
forever
from
the
long
and
irrecoverable
sleep
of
childhood
he
might
dose
again
but
he
could
never
sink
back
into
its
deep
unruffled
calm
and
indifference
was
it
this
that
the
river
had
tried
to
tell
him
when
he
had
heard
it
singing
back
turn
back
turn
it
still
sang
going
round
the
white
feet
of
the
girl
in
little
waves
and
eddies
but
its
voice
was
indistinct
like
that
of
an
old
prophet
who
mumbles
a
forgotten
and
disregarded
message
the
girl
at
his
side
stirred
do
they
call
you
and
he
returned
the
question
she
leant
her
head
away
from
him
on
her
shoulder
do
you
think
they
call
me
what
name
would
suit
me
best
but
you
never
guess
they
call
me
cherry
because
my
lips
are
cherry
because
her
lips
were
red
and
who
were
who
had
called
her
that
he
felt
jealous
of
them
knew
so
much
about
her
he
knew
nothing
and
here
was
the
supreme
marvel
that
for
years
she
had
been
walking
in
the
same
world
and
until
now
he
had
found
no
hint
of
her
he
might
have
passed
her
in
the
street
might
have
come
often
within
touching
distance
of
her
some
of
this
he
tried
to
say
to
her
she
listened
with
a
faint
smile
about
her
mouth
he
fell
silent
fearing
that
he
had
amused
her
by
his
sentiment
she
patted
his
hand
know
you
rather
wonderful
you
put
such
private
thoughts
into
words
do
you
always
think
behind
things
like
that
without
waiting
for
him
to
reply
she
continued
you
never
passed
me
in
the
street
you
could
have
met
me
any
earlier
because
i
lived
always
in
america
i
was
born
there
that
where
i
met
she
did
not
name
the
faun
man
but
her
face
clouded
must
be
getting
back
she
ended
vaguely
outside
the
wood
he
would
lose
her
lose
her
because
she
had
belonged
to
other
people
first
he
would
become
again
a
schoolboy
tricycling
out
into
the
country
with
kay
it
would
take
years
to
become
a
man
she
stood
up
must
go
how
sweet
and
slight
she
looked
like
a
tall
white
flower
swaying
in
the
shadows
he
had
read
in
books
of
who
in
the
bygone
days
of
romance
had
lifted
up
their
faces
from
amid
the
bracken
to
lure
knights
aside
from
their
quest
and
the
knights
having
once
kissed
them
had
lost
them
and
hungered
for
their
lips
forever
he
wanted
to
speak
wanted
to
say
something
true
wanted
to
tell
her
of
this
dynamic
change
that
she
had
worked
for
him
all
that
he
could
say
was
and
then
how
shall
i
find
you
me
she
laughed
tiptoeing
on
her
bare
feet
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
you
find
me
she
nodded
she
her
eyes
as
though
tired
by
his
urgency
then
she
threw
her
hands
to
her
side
like
you
peter
i
picking
up
her
shoes
and
stockings
she
pushed
back
the
bushes
not
to
he
listened
was
she
standing
there
hidden
by
the
screen
of
leaves
he
had
not
heard
the
rustle
of
her
going
suddenly
the
branches
were
thrust
back
and
again
he
saw
her
her
eyes
were
alight
with
merriment
and
her
mouth
was
puckered
little
peter
if
you
only
been
older
like
a
secret
door
in
a
green
wall
closing
the
branches
swished
back
the
wood
muttered
to
itself
as
she
went
from
him
and
then
fell
so
silent
that
it
seemed
to
stand
with
its
finger
pressed
against
its
mouth
chapter
xxviii
waking
up
the
world
is
a
mirror
into
which
we
gaze
and
see
the
reflection
of
ourselves
so
far
to
peter
it
had
been
a
foreground
of
small
boys
and
their
sisters
with
a
background
of
occasional
adult
relatives
but
now
like
a
fledgling
which
has
grown
to
strength
lying
snugly
in
its
nest
he
had
looked
out
and
seen
the
leafy
distance
below
him
his
curiosity
was
roused
the
commonplace
was
a
wonderland
what
went
on
down
there
where
did
the
parent
birds
go
and
how
did
they
find
their
way
back
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
landscape
that
people
called
because
he
was
young
when
he
looked
out
of
the
nest
the
distance
below
him
seemed
full
of
youngness
all
that
had
happened
up
to
now
the
collapse
of
aunt
jehane
fortunes
the
imprisonment
of
uncle
waffles
his
father
problems
and
the
marriage
of
grace
to
her
policeman
were
mere
stories
which
he
had
heard
reported
there
was
a
battle
called
life
going
on
somewhere
in
which
he
had
never
participated
he
was
tired
of
being
told
about
it
he
wanted
to
feel
the
rush
of
wind
under
his
outspread
wings
this
afternoon
in
a
gust
of
vivid
and
personal
experience
he
thought
he
had
felt
it
what
was
it
by
what
name
should
he
call
it
because
he
was
only
fifteen
love
sounded
too
large
a
word
and
yet
if
it
was
love
what
was
it
all
along
the
dusty
summer
road
through
the
golden
evening
as
he
tricycled
back
to
london
he
argued
with
himself
kay
interrupted
occasionally
and
he
answered
but
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
they
had
discovered
the
city
of
reality
and
went
from
door
to
door
tapping
demanding
entrance
ignorance
had
kept
him
unadventurous
and
contented
his
contentedness
was
breaking
down
he
was
glad
of
it
the
urgent
need
was
on
him
to
explain
creation
and
his
presence
in
the
world
how
were
people
born
why
did
they
marry
how
did
they
get
money
the
child
mind
like
the
philosopher
goes
back
to
fundamentals
all
this
outward
pageant
which
had
passed
before
his
eyes
for
fifteeen
years
as
a
sight
to
be
expected
had
suddenly
become
packed
with
hidden
significance
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
being
born
this
getting
and
spending
this
disastrous
and
glorious
loving
struggling
and
being
buried
there
was
no
one
to
whom
he
dared
go
for
an
answer
he
must
find
the
explanation
within
himself
in
the
isolation
of
that
thought
he
felt
a
great
gulf
opening
between
himself
and
his
little
sister
between
himself
and
everyone
he
loved
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
one
day
he
must
grow
into
a
man
he
was
elated
and
terrified
by
the
certainty
and
all
the
while
set
to
the
creaking
music
of
the
lumbering
tricycle
one
word
sung
itself
over
and
over
cherry
illustration
no
one
looking
at
his
childish
face
would
have
guessed
the
grave
suspicions
and
wild
hazards
that
walked
in
the
desperate
loneliness
of
his
imagination
it
was
the
key
to
existence
that
he
sought
he
had
arrived
at
that
crisis
of
soul
and
body
when
every
child
is
driven
out
a
john
the
baptist
into
the
wilderness
of
conjecture
there
to
live
on
the
locusts
and
wild
honey
of
hearsay
till
he
finds
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
as
they
neared
the
suburbs
a
stream
of
bicyclists
city
clerks
riding
out
with
their
sweethearts
met
engulfed
and
gave
them
passage
after
all
it
was
a
merry
laughing
world
above
the
tinkling
of
bells
evening
birds
were
calling
all
these
people
how
did
they
live
where
did
they
come
from
had
they
too
slept
and
been
awakened
questioning
because
a
girl
had
touched
them
down
the
road
he
saw
his
aunt
cottage
riska
would
be
there
by
the
gate
sitting
behind
her
table
spread
with
cakes
and
glasses
he
recalled
all
the
things
he
had
heard
said
of
her
things
to
which
he
had
paid
no
attention
that
she
was
a
born
flirt
and
that
her
mother
was
teaching
her
to
catch
men
as
they
came
up
she
lifted
her
soft
eyes
and
let
them
rest
on
him
with
contemptuous
affection
why
did
she
do
that
why
did
she
always
seem
to
despise
and
tolerate
men
and
boys
a
bicyclist
who
had
ridden
past
turned
his
head
caught
sight
of
her
and
came
back
slowly
peter
felt
that
it
was
not
thirst
but
prettiness
that
had
recalled
him
he
felt
angry
with
riska
unreasonably
angry
for
she
had
said
and
done
nothing
late
he
told
her
ca
she
nodded
she
did
care
her
whole
attitude
seemed
to
tell
peter
that
he
was
worth
wasting
time
on
just
as
the
pedals
had
begun
to
turn
glory
came
out
and
stood
in
the
porch
she
waved
to
him
and
shouted
something
he
called
to
her
that
they
were
in
a
hurry
further
down
the
road
he
turned
his
head
her
eyes
followed
him
it
was
nearly
dark
when
they
reached
topbury
lamps
stood
like
marigold
splashes
on
the
dusk
in
a
quivering
line
along
the
terrace
in
the
garden
he
found
his
parents
sitting
close
together
beneath
the
like
lovers
they
drew
apart
as
kay
ran
up
to
them
late
it
was
his
mother
talking
were
getting
he
kissed
her
for
a
moment
the
old
sense
of
security
returned
time
kay
was
in
she
crossed
the
gravel
path
with
her
arm
about
the
little
girl
and
disappeared
up
the
white
stone
steps
to
the
house
far
away
as
of
old
like
waves
about
the
foot
of
a
cliff
the
roar
of
london
threatened
it
seemed
to
be
telling
him
that
he
would
not
be
always
sheltered
that
one
day
he
would
have
to
launch
out
steering
in
search
of
the
unknown
future
by
himself
it
was
not
the
boldness
but
the
loneliness
of
the
adventure
that
now
impressed
him
the
voice
came
to
him
out
of
the
darkness
does
it
feel
like
to
become
a
man
like
peter
i
do
have
to
to
have
to
fight
for
oneself
his
father
leant
out
and
touched
him
you
begun
to
think
of
that
already
fight
for
yourself
you
wo
have
to
do
that
for
a
long
while
peter
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
into
the
arms
of
the
man
who
had
always
stood
between
him
and
the
world
when
the
time
comes
i
do
want
to
fail
like
he
was
going
to
have
said
like
uncle
waffles
but
he
said
instead
some
and
then
after
a
pause
feel
so
all
felt
that
way
sonny
somehow
we
get
the
strength
you
get
peter
sighed
contentedly
he
was
again
in
the
nest
with
the
walls
about
him
the
strained
note
had
gone
out
of
his
voice
when
he
spoke
now
so
much
to
learn
it
seems
so
strange
to
think
that
one
day
i
have
to
grow
up
like
you
and
marry
and
earn
money
and
have
little
boys
and
his
father
laughed
huskily
strange
strange
even
to
me
peter
and
i
done
it
and
know
there
are
times
when
even
a
man
looks
back
and
is
surprised
that
he
grown
up
he
feels
just
what
you
feeling
the
wonder
of
it
it
seems
only
the
other
day
that
i
was
as
small
as
you
are
and
only
the
other
day
that
i
was
frightened
of
life
and
what
it
meant
are
you
frightened
for
answer
peter
stood
up
so
much
frightened
as
his
father
rose
and
led
him
out
from
beneath
the
leaves
which
crowded
above
their
heads
he
pointed
up
past
the
roofs
of
houses
see
them
under
there
he
said
night
they
come
to
their
places
and
stand
shining
some
one
sends
them
some
one
sent
you
and
me
peter
we
do
know
why
there
are
people
who
sit
always
under
trees
and
never
look
up
they
tell
you
that
there
are
any
stars
overhead
we
not
like
that
we
know
that
whoever
is
careful
enough
to
hang
lamps
on
the
clouds
is
careful
enough
to
watch
over
us
so
we
need
be
afraid
of
living
need
we
old
chap
peter
pressed
his
father
hand
try
to
that
night
when
the
house
was
all
silent
he
crept
out
of
bed
leaning
from
the
open
window
he
looked
down
on
london
stretching
for
miles
and
miles
with
its
huddled
roofs
spread
over
its
huddled
personalities
why
were
things
as
they
were
if
some
one
lit
lamps
in
the
heavens
and
followed
each
life
with
care
why
did
four
women
who
loved
children
sit
forever
with
their
arms
empty
while
one
sang
of
the
sweet
fields
of
eden
and
why
did
uncle
waffles
the
questions
were
unanswerable
and
endless
and
then
in
defiant
contrast
there
came
bounding
into
his
memory
the
courageous
figure
of
the
faun
man
with
his
cavalier
attitudes
and
strong
determination
to
make
of
life
a
laughing
affair
the
night
quickened
the
ghostly
feet
of
a
little
breeze
tiptoed
across
the
causing
their
leaves
to
rustle
from
the
far
distance
the
throb
of
belated
traffic
reached
him
like
the
beat
of
a
muffled
drum
he
heard
london
marching
to
the
martial
music
of
struggle
his
heart
was
stirred
life
was
a
fight
well
what
of
it
when
his
time
came
he
must
be
ready
he
looked
again
at
the
stars
remembering
what
his
father
had
said
one
need
not
be
frightened
and
then
he
looked
away
into
the
blackness
somewhere
over
there
the
houses
ended
and
the
wide
peace
of
the
country
commenced
somewhere
over
there
was
cherry
he
waited
impatiently
for
his
next
when
he
would
be
free
to
tricycle
out
when
he
went
she
was
not
in
the
haunted
wood
nor
the
next
time
nor
the
next
he
wanted
to
ask
the
faun
man
but
postponed
through
shyness
he
was
afraid
his
secret
would
be
guessed
he
was
always
hoping
and
hoping
that
he
would
find
her
behind
the
green
wall
of
leaves
where
the
little
river
ran
one
afternoon
when
tea
was
ended
and
kay
and
harry
had
gone
out
he
asked
the
girl
who
broke
your
pictures
never
come
here
now
the
faun
man
looked
up
sharply
and
stared
trying
to
guess
behind
the
question
was
very
decent
to
you
that
day
was
i
and
i
was
beastly
to
think
she
was
sorry
said
peter
softly
wish
you
let
her
does
she
never
come
here
now
the
faun
man
leant
forward
across
the
table
with
his
face
between
his
long
brown
hands
you
like
her
peter
much
peter
lowered
his
eyes
when
he
dared
to
glance
up
he
found
that
the
faun
man
was
laughing
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
peter
young
he
said
is
it
well
she
a
year
older
it
dangerous
to
like
a
girl
very
much
especially
a
little
wild
thing
like
cherry
i
a
man
and
i
know
because
i
too
like
some
one
very
much
and
it
does
always
make
me
happy
you
like
heaps
of
girls
peter
before
you
find
the
right
he
felt
that
peter
hand
had
grown
smaller
in
his
own
and
was
withdrawing
think
it
is
true
he
questioned
think
it
was
kind
of
me
to
say
that
and
you
want
to
see
her
peter
gazed
out
of
the
cottage
window
to
where
sunlight
fell
aslant
the
haunted
wood
why
should
he
want
to
see
her
more
than
anyone
in
the
world
but
he
did
and
he
knew
that
because
he
was
so
young
most
people
would
consider
his
desire
absurd
but
the
faun
man
who
found
so
much
to
laugh
at
was
regarding
him
seriously
you
want
to
see
her
peter
whispered
the
faun
man
eyes
filmed
over
in
that
curious
way
they
had
he
said
want
you
to
trust
me
there
are
reasons
why
you
ca
see
her
sent
her
away
because
i
think
that
it
best
i
ca
tell
you
why
or
where
i
sent
her
or
what
right
i
have
to
send
her
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
do
smile
at
you
for
liking
her
it
does
matter
how
old
or
young
we
are
when
love
comes
it
always
hurts
and
it
seems
just
as
serious
whether
it
comes
late
or
early
but
some
day
i
let
you
see
her
to
you
at
fifteen
some
day
seems
very
far
from
now
but
if
you
wait
and
still
think
you
care
for
her
i
let
you
see
her
when
the
time
comes
i
do
think
we
ought
to
speak
of
this
again
till
then
we
keep
it
a
secret
which
we
never
discuss
but
we
each
remember
is
that
a
bargain
peter
had
no
other
choice
than
to
accept
they
shook
hands
shortly
after
this
kay
and
peter
went
away
to
a
farm
in
north
wales
for
their
summer
holidays
their
first
intention
on
their
return
was
to
visit
the
faun
man
and
harry
on
going
to
the
stable
they
found
that
the
tricycle
was
no
longer
there
their
father
was
very
mysterious
and
unconcerned
when
they
told
him
evidently
he
knew
what
had
happened
right
he
said
wait
a
day
or
two
you
see
it
come
and
one
morning
it
did
come
back
ridden
by
a
man
with
a
face
all
smudges
who
presented
a
bill
for
payment
it
had
entirely
transformed
itself
like
a
who
had
been
brisked
up
by
an
unexpected
offer
of
marriage
from
a
sober
tricycle
it
had
taken
on
an
appearance
almost
modern
and
festive
its
had
been
replated
its
framework
its
tall
wheels
cut
down
its
solid
tires
removed
and
replaced
by
pneumatics
it
sparkled
in
the
sun
as
though
defying
to
jeer
at
it
the
man
with
the
face
all
smudges
wheeled
it
through
the
stable
into
the
garden
he
left
it
beneath
the
and
there
the
children
on
arriving
home
from
school
found
it
it
a
new
tricycle
peter
looked
it
over
it
is
kitten
kay
it
the
old
one
their
mother
hearing
their
shouts
came
out
into
the
garden
nearly
as
excited
herself
they
had
visions
of
spinning
out
to
the
happy
cottage
at
the
breakneck
speed
of
eight
miles
an
hour
while
they
clambered
on
to
it
examined
it
and
spotted
new
improvements
in
the
way
of
a
lamp
and
saddles
she
explained
to
them
how
it
had
happened
your
doing
he
meant
it
as
a
surprise
he
thought
the
old
tires
made
it
too
heavy
so
kay
interrupted
peter
do
let
take
it
out
on
to
the
terrace
and
try
as
they
wheeled
it
down
the
gravel
path
between
the
geranium
beds
they
chattered
of
how
they
would
surprise
harry
but
harry
was
fated
never
to
see
it
on
the
terrace
when
they
had
mounted
while
their
mother
watched
them
from
the
window
they
found
that
everything
was
not
well
the
man
with
the
face
all
smudges
had
been
wise
in
demanding
his
money
before
his
handiwork
was
tested
he
had
cut
the
wheels
so
low
that
where
the
road
was
uneven
the
pedals
bumped
against
the
ground
life
had
indeed
become
serious
for
peter
through
his
kindness
his
means
of
communication
between
reality
and
fairyland
had
been
annihilated
for
a
time
it
looked
as
though
so
small
an
accident
as
the
indiscreet
remodeling
of
a
tricycle
had
lost
for
him
forever
the
new
friendships
formed
at
the
happy
cottage
but
one
evening
a
dinner
was
given
by
barrington
to
a
famous
man
whose
work
he
was
anxious
to
publish
kay
and
peter
were
allowed
to
see
him
after
dessert
the
moment
peter
head
appeared
round
the
door
the
famous
man
rose
up
and
shouted
young
so
at
last
i
found
you
where
the
dickens
have
you
been
hiding
barrington
lay
back
in
his
chair
his
arms
hanging
limp
on
either
side
the
image
of
amazement
he
heard
his
son
explaining
was
the
tandem
trike
father
wanted
to
be
kind
to
us
and
well
after
had
it
improved
it
would
work
and
so
you
see
there
was
no
way
of
getting
to
the
faun
man
spread
out
his
long
legs
laughing
uproariously
until
the
appearance
of
the
children
he
been
most
scrupulously
conventional
and
polite
peter
an
immortal
friendship
like
ours
cut
short
by
a
tandem
trike
you
little
donkey
why
did
you
write
kay
rose
up
in
her
brother
defence
is
a
little
donkey
we
were
all
to
be
pretence
people
do
you
remember
we
did
know
your
the
faun
man
stroked
his
chin
and
lengthened
his
face
you
left
me
alone
much
longer
he
said
would
have
found
me
i
moving
into
then
their
parents
began
to
ask
questions
the
story
of
friday
lane
and
the
boy
came
out
that
evening
after
lorenzo
arran
had
said
he
turned
back
to
his
host
just
as
the
door
was
closing
i
say
one
minute
barrington
that
matter
we
were
discussing
yesterday
let
consider
it
barrington
watched
the
tall
lean
figure
go
striding
down
the
terrace
he
was
so
taken
up
with
watching
that
he
did
know
that
nan
had
stolen
up
behind
him
until
she
touched
his
hand
he
turned
his
mouth
was
crooked
with
amusement
you
hear
that
he
agrees
i
to
publish
for
him
and
it
peter
doing
one
never
knows
where
that
boy
wo
turn
and
peter
snuggled
cosily
in
bed
was
wondering
whether
now
that
found
the
faun
man
he
refind
cherry
he
reflected
that
when
life
could
play
such
tricks
on
you
a
lifetime
of
it
would
be
half
bad
he
was
no
longer
frightened
to
remember
that
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
he
must
grow
up
chapter
xxix
a
golden
world
and
he
refound
her
when
he
had
almost
forgotten
her
in
those
four
long
years
which
stretch
like
a
magic
ocean
between
the
island
of
boyhood
and
the
misty
coasts
of
early
manhood
it
is
so
easy
to
forget
those
years
between
fifteen
and
nineteen
are
the
longest
in
life
perhaps
they
had
been
spent
by
peter
among
books
watching
as
in
a
crystal
the
dead
at
work
they
had
risen
from
their
graves
in
the
dusk
of
his
imagination
stretched
themselves
gathered
strength
and
marched
anew
to
the
downfall
of
troy
and
the
conquest
of
befabled
empires
how
real
those
poignant
religions
were
telling
of
the
loves
of
ruffianly
gods
for
perishable
so
real
to
him
that
he
had
paid
little
heed
to
the
present
in
his
outward
life
nothing
had
much
altered
things
were
called
by
different
names
they
spoke
of
him
as
nearly
a
man
now
servants
addressed
him
as
they
had
never
doubted
that
he
was
a
boy
once
kay
stood
a
few
inches
higher
on
her
legs
romance
had
retired
from
active
business
leaving
to
her
children
the
unthankful
task
of
having
kittens
just
as
peter
was
said
to
be
nearly
a
man
and
had
changed
so
the
nursery
was
said
to
be
his
study
though
it
was
almost
the
same
in
appearance
a
student
lamp
had
replaced
the
old
shelves
which
had
held
volumes
in
which
truth
was
depicted
with
a
laughing
countenance
now
supported
serious
lexicons
from
which
truth
stared
out
with
austerity
but
his
study
retained
reminders
of
those
tremulous
days
when
it
was
still
a
nursery
and
had
grown
up
when
it
was
the
dreaming
place
of
a
girl
whose
arms
were
empty
in
whose
heart
had
begun
to
echo
the
patter
of
tiny
footsteps
the
tall
guard
stood
before
the
fireplace
as
though
it
feared
that
the
long
youth
who
sat
continually
poring
over
a
book
with
his
eyes
shaded
by
his
hand
might
shrink
into
the
urchin
who
had
known
that
live
coals
burned
the
laburnum
still
leant
her
arms
upon
the
and
shedding
her
golden
tassels
she
gazed
in
upon
him
with
the
same
indiscretion
as
when
he
was
a
newcomer
with
ungovernable
arms
and
legs
who
had
to
be
tubbed
night
and
morning
and
she
saw
the
same
mother
who
had
sung
him
to
sleep
peer
in
at
the
door
on
her
way
to
bed
tiptoe
across
the
threshold
ruffle
his
hair
and
whisper
darling
you
ca
learn
everything
between
now
and
morning
wo
you
get
some
rest
he
had
exchanged
tandem
tricycles
for
lexicons
as
a
means
of
locomotion
to
the
land
of
adventure
his
little
sister
could
no
longer
accompany
him
but
the
desire
for
wisdom
had
left
room
for
the
heart
of
tenderness
when
his
lamp
shone
solitary
in
the
darkened
house
he
would
straighten
his
shoulders
and
listen
fancying
he
heard
the
whistle
in
four
months
he
was
going
up
to
oxford
to
live
in
gray
cloisters
where
boys
at
once
become
men
his
father
shared
his
anticipation
generously
going
to
recover
my
lost
chances
lucky
chap
it
was
summer
he
had
risen
early
and
sat
by
his
study
window
reading
the
iliad
the
house
was
full
of
lazy
morning
sounds
running
breakfast
being
prepared
doors
opening
and
shutting
footsteps
on
the
stairs
outside
in
the
garden
the
sun
dropped
golden
balls
which
tumbled
through
the
trees
and
rolled
across
the
turf
birds
hopping
in
and
out
the
were
industriously
foraging
tripping
up
the
with
flowers
in
her
hands
he
could
see
his
little
sister
her
gold
hair
blowing
a
tap
fell
upon
his
door
a
maid
rustling
in
a
starched
dress
entered
just
come
master
me
a
telegram
he
slit
it
open
and
read
henley
with
skylark
ca
you
come
for
regatta
cherry
with
cherry
with
him
it
was
signed
lorenzo
arran
so
he
was
keeping
his
promise
but
why
should
cherry
be
with
him
and
where
had
she
been
hiding
all
those
long
four
years
so
the
faun
man
had
taken
his
houseboat
to
henley
it
would
be
rather
jolly
to
join
him
but
after
all
he
ought
to
stick
to
his
work
and
this
girl
did
he
want
to
see
her
the
maid
was
waiting
a
telegram
at
topbury
was
a
rarity
in
these
days
it
cost
sixpence
at
the
cheapest
therefore
its
use
was
restricted
to
the
announcement
of
the
extremes
of
joy
and
sorrow
births
deaths
and
financial
losses
she
showed
relief
when
he
looked
up
cheerily
and
said
the
boy
no
when
she
had
gone
he
stood
up
walked
about
the
room
excitedly
and
halted
by
the
window
he
would
go
of
course
it
would
run
his
father
into
expense
then
again
he
read
the
words
with
it
would
be
amusing
to
see
her
he
began
to
wonder
did
she
know
that
the
faun
man
had
sent
for
him
if
she
did
his
thoughts
flew
back
across
the
years
he
was
in
the
haunted
wood
the
little
river
was
singing
back
turn
back
turn
he
refused
to
turn
back
and
followed
suddenly
across
the
he
found
himself
gazing
into
the
gray
eyes
of
a
girl
it
was
the
grayness
of
her
eyes
and
the
whiteness
of
her
feet
that
he
remembered
he
leant
over
the
table
and
closed
the
book
with
its
unreal
of
gods
and
goddesses
jove
but
i
like
to
go
he
said
aloud
the
maid
had
spread
the
news
of
the
unusual
happening
as
he
entered
the
all
eyes
examined
him
they
waited
for
him
to
be
communicative
at
last
his
father
said
a
telegram
peter
drew
it
from
his
pocket
and
passed
it
his
father
looked
up
with
me
what
does
he
mean
by
that
peter
raised
his
eyebrows
as
much
as
to
say
can
i
tell
his
father
handed
it
back
you
going
money
and
i
too
much
it
was
the
mention
of
work
that
roused
his
mother
she
smiled
gently
and
glanced
down
the
table
at
her
husband
would
do
him
good
it
would
do
you
good
his
father
said
do
you
go
old
chap
why
do
you
go
kay
echoed
his
things
were
quickly
packed
in
a
flannel
suit
with
his
straw
hat
in
his
hand
he
was
saying
on
the
doorstep
his
father
bethought
him
wait
a
second
peter
i
walk
with
you
to
the
end
of
the
while
walking
he
delivered
his
warning
man
arran
personally
i
like
him
and
i
know
he
your
friend
but
nothing
against
him
but
he
a
queer
fellow
clever
as
the
dickens
and
all
that
the
fact
is
curious
tales
are
told
about
him
all
of
them
too
to
be
true
you
know
the
saying
about
no
smoke
without
fire
well
it
may
be
that
he
only
different
but
he
strikes
people
as
being
fast
and
dangerous
be
careful
i
trust
you
anywhere
have
a
good
time
i
got
it
off
my
chest
my
sermon
at
the
bottom
of
the
crescent
to
his
great
relief
peter
found
that
cat
meat
master
was
not
on
the
stand
he
would
have
hurt
grace
feelings
for
the
world
he
was
free
to
jump
into
a
spanking
hansom
cat
meat
may
have
seen
him
but
cat
meat
could
tell
surely
at
his
age
he
must
have
been
glad
to
escape
the
long
crawl
to
paddington
the
younger
horse
in
the
hansom
stepped
out
gaily
making
his
hoofs
ring
smartly
against
the
cobblestones
cherry
cherry
they
seemed
to
be
saying
taking
by
now
following
gleaming
now
dashing
through
mean
streets
past
public
houses
in
plenty
they
sped
till
they
struck
paddington
and
drew
up
in
the
station
and
then
the
drifting
motion
of
the
train
and
the
unbelievable
greenness
of
the
country
the
glimpses
of
silver
water
quiet
meadows
and
cottages
in
which
people
were
born
and
died
and
never
traveled
and
the
holiday
crowds
on
the
platforms
the
girls
in
summer
dresses
the
superb
cleanness
and
coolness
of
them
and
the
happiness
it
was
exciting
the
wheels
beneath
his
carriage
drummed
out
one
word
cherry
he
did
know
even
yet
whether
he
wanted
to
see
her
the
train
achieved
the
surprise
of
the
century
it
arrived
early
he
examined
the
expectant
faces
of
the
people
neither
harry
nor
the
faun
man
was
there
he
refused
to
hang
about
his
legs
ached
to
be
moving
picking
up
his
bag
he
set
out
to
walk
hoping
he
would
meet
them
streets
were
garish
flowers
in
gardens
foamy
toilets
of
women
college
blazers
and
rowing
colors
and
over
all
swift
white
clouds
and
the
fiercely
gleaming
sun
from
under
wide
girls
laughed
up
into
men
tanned
faces
everyone
was
young
or
because
the
world
was
golden
seemed
to
be
young
peter
wanted
some
one
to
laugh
with
walking
down
the
middle
of
the
street
the
crowd
moved
in
pairs
a
man
and
a
woman
together
almost
invariably
the
old
gray
town
like
peter
looked
lonely
in
this
hubbub
of
jostling
love
and
merriment
as
he
came
in
sight
of
the
catherine
wheel
a
distant
cheering
commenced
feet
moved
faster
men
caught
at
women
arms
and
women
caught
up
their
dresses
the
army
of
commenced
to
run
because
peter
was
by
himself
he
forged
ahead
and
found
a
place
on
the
bridge
where
people
stood
yelling
and
jammed
shoulder
to
shoulder
at
first
he
could
make
out
hardly
anything
because
of
the
sea
of
hats
and
backs
in
front
of
him
then
the
crowd
swayed
he
took
advantage
of
it
and
found
himself
leaning
over
the
crumbling
stone
balustrade
gazing
down
on
one
of
the
most
gallant
sights
in
england
through
a
steep
bank
of
posies
made
up
of
river
gardens
and
human
faces
ran
a
silver
thread
approaching
with
what
seemed
incredible
slowness
were
two
specks
about
the
size
of
matches
as
the
sun
caught
them
one
saw
the
flash
of
blades
whipping
the
water
with
the
regularity
of
clockwork
stealthily
with
infinite
labor
one
stole
ahead
the
garden
of
faces
on
either
side
of
the
silver
thread
trembled
a
roar
went
up
which
gathered
volume
as
it
drew
from
out
the
distance
peter
pressed
his
lips
against
a
man
ear
a
complete
stranger
and
shouted
is
it
the
man
stared
at
him
despisingly
diamond
sculls
roy
hardcastle
again
the
he
turned
away
and
paid
peter
no
more
attention
peter
though
not
much
wiser
at
once
became
a
partisan
and
screamed
the
one
name
he
knew
hardcastle
hardcastle
till
his
throat
felt
as
if
it
had
burst
and
now
they
were
well
in
sight
two
men
with
bent
backs
and
arms
that
worked
like
levers
each
seated
in
a
machine
as
narrow
as
a
needle
with
long
wooden
legs
which
stuck
out
on
either
side
striding
the
water
and
keeping
the
balance
they
looked
like
human
gone
mad
the
river
rose
to
its
feet
the
was
nearing
the
channel
of
free
water
seemed
to
narrow
as
skiffs
gigs
punts
dingeys
and
every
kind
of
craft
pressed
closer
to
the
booms
which
marked
the
course
something
happened
both
men
drooped
inertly
forward
over
trailing
sculls
it
was
dramatic
this
immediate
transition
from
frantic
energy
to
listless
collapse
hats
were
tossed
up
launches
shrieked
and
whistled
everyone
tried
to
make
more
noise
than
his
neighbor
peter
with
the
rest
rowed
well
rowed
sir
well
when
the
clamor
had
died
down
he
turned
to
where
the
man
had
been
standing
won
and
then
i
beg
your
he
was
gazing
into
the
amused
face
of
a
girl
with
gray
eyes
and
hair
that
swept
like
a
cloud
across
a
clear
white
forehead
won
roy
hardcastle
of
course
england
not
beaten
he
was
thinking
of
england
honor
the
race
it
had
never
happened
he
was
looking
at
her
mouth
they
called
her
cherry
because
her
lips
were
red
she
was
going
from
him
how
straight
she
was
how
slender
like
a
slim
spring
flower
a
narcissus
perhaps
he
went
after
her
and
raised
his
hat
me
for
speaking
to
you
just
a
minute
before
a
man
was
standing
there
and
all
right
she
said
again
she
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
he
had
to
make
certain
i
been
so
rude
already
would
you
mind
if
i
asked
you
one
more
question
she
looked
him
over
casually
and
seemed
more
satisfied
that
she
was
willing
to
admit
to
anyone
but
herself
at
he
straightened
his
necktie
nervously
can
you
tell
me
where
find
skylark
it
a
belonging
to
lorenzo
she
laughed
softly
and
stood
with
her
eyes
cast
down
tapping
the
pavement
with
her
foot
he
was
sure
now
she
looked
up
have
i
seen
you
somehow
you
familiar
it
annoying
you
knew
me
in
a
cherry
to
a
few
of
my
dearest
he
glanced
away
from
her
were
cherry
to
me
once
for
about
an
hour
you
been
cherry
to
me
ever
since
there
was
a
long
pause
yet
i
do
know
you
she
said
must
be
the
friend
arran
was
expecting
down
from
peter
nodded
and
harry
went
to
meet
you
you
must
have
missed
each
other
at
the
station
if
you
like
i
show
you
the
way
to
i
going
there
they
be
wondering
whether
you
come
we
better
please
not
why
not
she
asked
puzzled
i
i
do
know
my
pride
touched
that
you
do
know
me
would
you
think
it
awfully
cheeky
if
i
were
to
ask
you
to
come
and
have
tea
with
me
first
she
opened
her
parasol
gaining
time
while
she
made
her
mind
up
and
then
game
i
have
had
much
adventure
lately
i
just
out
of
a
convent
school
in
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
so
that
was
it
they
entered
the
red
lion
and
walked
through
into
the
garden
they
ordered
tea
at
a
small
table
from
which
they
could
see
the
river
did
you
say
that
she
asked
did
i
say
said
so
that
was
it
you
opened
your
mouth
so
wide
when
you
said
it
that
i
thought
you
gape
your
head
off
when
i
was
a
little
girl
in
america
we
had
a
colored
cook
with
a
decapitating
smile
it
nearly
met
at
the
back
of
her
neck
well
your
was
a
decapitating
now
tell
me
i
waited
four
years
to
find
out
where
you
been
years
she
tried
to
think
back
he
leant
his
elbows
on
the
table
his
face
between
his
hands
a
long
while
does
it
in
four
years
one
can
grow
up
last
time
we
were
together
you
made
me
a
promise
you
said
we
meet
again
often
in
the
same
place
i
went
there
and
went
there
you
did
keep
your
she
laughed
suppose
it
a
trifle
too
late
to
say
i
sorry
i
suppose
you
minded
she
waited
for
him
to
contradict
that
when
he
did
she
continued
much
do
you
know
about
me
for
instance
what
my
real
name
he
laughed
in
return
got
me
there
all
you
told
me
was
that
people
called
you
cherry
because
your
lips
were
she
sank
her
head
between
her
shoulders
then
she
looked
up
flushing
and
pursing
her
lips
together
like
a
child
who
wants
to
extract
a
favor
by
being
loved
a
sportsman
you
awfully
tantalizing
give
me
a
pointer
that
help
me
to
guess
you
know
i
ought
to
know
who
you
are
it
is
good
form
for
a
girl
to
take
tea
with
a
strange
young
he
said
speaking
slowly
you
remember
a
day
when
you
knocked
down
and
walked
over
oh
let
say
about
twenty
photographs
of
the
same
lady
i
remember
she
sniffed
a
little
scornfully
likely
forget
that
was
why
the
faun
man
sent
me
to
a
she
had
said
rather
more
than
she
intended
she
was
provoked
with
herself
and
with
peter
for
the
moment
because
he
had
drawn
her
out
she
twisted
round
on
her
chair
so
that
he
could
see
only
her
shoulders
not
realizing
that
he
was
being
snubbed
he
pushed
the
subject
further
an
unfair
punishment
that
does
sound
like
the
faun
man
but
perhaps
you
liked
it
what
did
you
do
at
the
convent
praying
she
answered
with
her
shoulders
still
toward
him
look
here
do
you
say
that
the
faun
man
was
unfair
he
was
he
did
send
me
away
only
for
breaking
his
and
then
inconsequently
it
was
too
childish
i
go
and
smash
them
all
suddenly
she
swung
round
know
who
you
are
hurray
you
peter
you
see
i
remember
the
name
shall
i
give
myself
away
and
tell
you
why
i
remember
do
he
urged
the
answer
came
promptly
you
paid
me
compliments
you
thought
that
god
said
to
himself
when
he
made
me
make
the
most
beautiful
person
i
ever
hulloa
you
do
like
that
it
was
quite
what
you
expected
what
did
you
expect
until
you
tell
me
i
wo
speak
to
compelled
by
her
silence
he
confessed
did
hope
that
you
might
have
remembered
me
for
something
something
more
romantic
you
see
we
met
in
the
haunted
wood
and
there
was
the
river
and
you
were
going
to
drown
yourself
you
taken
off
your
shoes
and
stockings
as
a
first
step
which
was
very
economical
of
you
and
i
i
saw
your
feet
and
she
waved
her
handkerchief
at
him
her
eyes
know
i
know
very
pretty
and
very
foolish
she
rose
ought
to
be
outside
the
red
lion
she
turned
toward
the
river
left
my
boat
at
one
of
the
when
they
had
found
it
and
he
had
helped
her
in
she
said
can
row
i
suppose
all
right
then
i
steer
you
take
the
they
drifted
down
with
the
stream
the
gray
bridge
spanning
the
river
growing
more
distant
behind
them
the
wooded
hills
swimming
up
on
every
side
to
form
a
green
cup
against
which
the
sky
stooped
its
lips
they
floated
by
lazy
craft
in
which
women
lay
back
on
cushions
beneath
sunshades
and
men
with
bare
arms
clasped
about
their
knees
watched
them
snatches
of
laughter
reached
them
to
which
the
murmur
of
voices
droned
an
accompaniment
on
green
lawns
beneath
dreaming
garden
trees
little
groups
of
brightly
attired
people
clustered
from
houseboats
along
the
stole
music
one
air
creeping
into
another
as
they
passed
fashioning
a
medley
coon
songs
from
america
victorian
ballads
of
sentiment
a
wild
scrap
of
dvorak
and
the
latest
impertinence
from
london
of
all
that
they
saw
and
heard
they
alone
were
constant
in
the
shifting
landscape
four
years
she
murmured
he
stopped
rowing
and
gazed
at
her
wonderingly
repeating
her
words
four
years
then
a
familiar
voice
leapt
out
at
them
from
a
with
curtains
fluttering
in
the
windows
and
a
rim
of
scarlet
geraniums
running
round
it
in
boxes
the
voice
lent
the
touch
of
humor
to
their
tenderness
which
saves
sentiment
from
sadness
and
makes
it
ecstatic
it
sang
to
the
twinkling
tones
of
a
mandolin
struck
sharply
tickle
me
here
for

ai
what
you
thought

chapter
xxx
half
in
love
the
faun
man
looked
up
from
his
writing
peter
had
been
with
him
on
for
five
days
five
gorgeous
days
he
had
found
to
his
surprise
that
the
golden
woman
was
of
the
party
so
far
as
outward
appearances
went
the
incident
might
never
have
happened
cherry
conducted
herself
as
a
good
comrade
and
the
golden
woman
called
her
they
had
to
act
as
friends
since
the
faun
man
had
taken
rooms
for
them
at
the
same
hotel
that
they
might
chaperone
each
other
the
men
slept
on
board
the
it
was
nearly
six
the
last
of
the
finals
had
been
rowed
the
regatta
was
ended
far
up
the
course
one
could
still
hear
the
distant
cheering
from
the
lawn
where
prizes
were
being
distributed
the
most
sensational
race
of
the
afternoon
had
been
the
diamond
sculls
in
which
hardcastle
had
won
by
a
bare
peter
still
tingled
with
the
madness
of
the
excitement
the
splendid
grit
of
the
contested
fight
and
the
wildness
of
the
applause
he
had
seen
a
slight
young
hero
lifted
out
of
his
shell
and
carried
he
wanted
something
like
that
to
happen
to
himself
so
that
cherry
might
approve
of
him
he
had
just
come
from
accompanying
her
back
to
the
red
lion
in
an
hour
when
she
had
changed
for
dinner
he
was
going
to
fetch
her
he
had
one
more
night
before
him
the
gayest
of
them
all
when
the
crews
broke
training
and
then
how
often
would
he
see
her
again
the
gray
old
town
would
recover
from
its
invasion
and
settle
back
into
routine
and
eventless
quiet
would
something
similar
happen
to
his
life
nevertheless
he
had
one
more
night
as
he
climbed
aboard
and
entered
the
faun
man
looked
up
i
tired
of
being
respectable
i
want
to
be
peter
threw
himself
into
a
creaking
not
difficult
it
chiefly
a
matter
of
accent
the
faun
man
added
speech
is
the
soap
and
water
of
good
peter
chuckled
do
the
faun
man
stood
up
and
stretched
himself
have
i
written
a
that
never
saw
a
nailbrush
it
called
belle
of
when
i
sung
it
to
you
i
tell
you
why
i
wrote
it
is
this
a
ripping
tune
he
tinkled
it
over
then
sat
down
crosslegged
on
the
floor
and
commenced
to
drawl
the
words
out
bloke
a
moke
and
caw
tell
me
why
but
the
fust
time
spoke
was
no
more
than
a
sigh
says
i
mind
me
we
soon
be
dead
says
yer
dies
i
break
me
says
i
not

instead
yer
quaint

the
faun
man
nodded
the
time
swaying
from
the
hips
and
rolling
his
head
yer
caw
be
when
yer
in
he
laid
his
mandolin
aside
is
it
there
may
be
much
soap
about
the
dialect
but
there
plenty
of
philosophy
in
the
sense
more
than
one
person
in
this
party
is
half
in
love
take
example
from
me
peter
do
make
a
fool
of
peter
face
went
red
he
did
think
he
been
so
obvious
to
escape
further
pursuit
he
turned
the
corner
rapidly
are
you
going
to
start
being
vulgar
yes
the
faun
man
came
back
he
struck
a
pose
his
left
hand
resting
on
his
hip
his
right
beating
against
his
breast
he
said
i
lose
my
identity
i
cease
to
be
lorenzo
arran
and
become
bill
willow
with
his
performing
troupe
of
eccentric
minstrels
i
wear
a
red
nose
my
clothes
might
have
been
picked
out
of
any
peter
interrupted
where
do
you
get
the
eccentric
minstrels
the
faun
man
grabbed
him
by
the
shoulder
as
though
he
feared
he
might
dash
away
when
the
full
glory
of
the
project
was
divulged
boy
you
one
of
them
you
operate
upon
a
folded
over
a
you
wear
let
me
see
you
wear
a
sheet
with
holes
cut
in
it
for
your
eyes
and
mouth
your
nose
may
remain
incognito
i
seen
better
in
a
word
you
play
the
ghost
to
my
harry
and
the
girls
the
faun
man
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
and
reflected
me
see
harry
blacks
his
physiognomy
the
disguises
the
rest
of
him
it
always
does
and
as
for
the
girls
they
hang
their
hair
before
their
faces
and
sing
through
it
believe
me
nothing
alters
a
appearance
so
much
as
letting
down
her
hair
that
why
all
divorces
occur
after
marriage
now
with
me
it
different
i
look
my
best
in
bed
of
course
i
ca
ask
anyone
to
see
me
there
that
why
i
a
but
to
get
back
to
vulgarity
we
start
in
a
punt
we
wait
till
it
dusk
and
we
have
lanterns
we
collect
money
for
the
private
insane
asylums
of
alaska
i
make
a
little
speech
explaining
our
philanthropy
young
feller
bill
willow
and
his
minstrels
are
going
to
make
this
old
regatta
rememberable
for
years
to
mean
it
the
faun
man
grinned
all
the
boy
in
him
was
up
do
look
so
of
course
i
mean
it
i
mean
it
just
as
truly
as
martin
luther
did
when
he
said
i
take
my
stand
because
i
got
nowhere
to
sit
down
a
profound
utterance
i
tired
of
watching
all
these
people
spooning
under
trees
wearing
leander
ties
comparing
their
girls
eyes
to
the
stars
and
being
afraid
to
touch
each
other
they
too
much
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
even
we
are
i
going
to
be
a
ruffian
cut
along
and
fetch
the
girls
i
got
to
write
another
song
and
it
almost
time
for
dress
rehearsal
spots
said
the
faun
man
when
peter
broke
the
news
to
the
golden
woman
she
covered
her
face
and
laughed
through
her
hands
she
had
a
trick
of
treating
cherry
and
peter
like
children
although
she
looked
no
more
than
twenty
herself
she
put
her
arms
round
their
shoulders
drawing
their
faces
close
together
on
either
side
of
hers
she
was
so
happy
and
beautiful
it
would
have
been
difficult
not
to
love
her
she
said
do
a
if
it
was
for
the
water
under
the
punt
i
all
against
getting
wet
are
you
cherry
peter
looked
knowing
first
thing
she
do
if
she
knew
she
was
going
to
drown
would
be
to
take
off
her
shoes
and
the
golden
woman
pinched
the
girl
cheek
secrets
already
but
i
do
like
lorie
idea
for
disguising
us
let
see
what
we
can
do
with
five
minutes
when
they
rowed
up
to
they
were
met
by
a
mysterious
silence
lifting
out
their
parcels
they
tiptoed
into
the
cabin
harry
was
bending
over
a
with
a
in
his
hand
and
a
bottle
of
blacking
at
his
elbow
the
faun
man
was
melting
the
bottoms
of
candles
and
making
them
stick
to
the
bottoms
of
empty
are
you
doing
they
both
looked
up
getting
the
illuminations
ready
said
the
faun
man
i
making
our
flag
said
harry
scrubbing
hard
at
the
awful
stuff
it
so
they
crowded
round
him
to
inspect
his
handiwork
and
read
bill
impromptu
troupe
of
eccentric
minstrels
no
fun
without
folly
envy
the
poor
mad
the
faun
man
affixed
his
last
candle
then
you
crazy
people
rehearsal
in
five
minutes
let
fortify
our
behind
the
the
sun
was
setting
in
patches
where
water
lay
most
still
among
rushes
the
river
shone
sometimes
beneath
the
window
they
heard
the
dip
of
oars
and
a
boat
drifted
past
they
were
miles
from
reality
in
a
hushed
and
painted
world
they
had
become
little
children
for
the
moment
though
the
faun
man
had
called
it
they
had
become
immensely
serious
over
a
thing
which
matter
there
were
the
words
of
the
songs
to
learn
and
then
the
tunes
after
that
there
were
the
cretonnes
to
cut
out
and
run
together
into
burlesque
extremely
ample
so
as
to
cover
their
proper
dresses
the
golden
woman
had
surprised
a
prim
widow
in
hart
street
by
asking
for
ugliest
materials
you
have
in
your
she
had
met
with
success
no
materials
could
have
been
uglier
one
had
a
background
strewn
with
gigantic
poppies
across
another
floated
in
a
kind
of
gravy
the
unbarbered
heads
of
bodyless
angels
the
faun
man
and
peter
when
their
needles
lost
the
thread
gave
up
sewing
and
fastened
theirs
together
with
paper
pins
and
all
the
while
beneath
the
absurdity
of
it
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
tenderness
as
if
folly
had
brought
them
all
nearer
the
faun
man
kept
watching
the
golden
woman
and
cherry
the
faun
man
and
peter
cherry
as
for
harry
he
was
the
only
one
whose
eyes
were
free
to
take
in
everybody
when
night
had
fallen
they
slipped
on
their
masks
and
stepped
into
the
punt
harry
took
the
pole
and
pushed
off
from
the
faun
man
sat
next
to
the
golden
woman
humming
snatches
of
song
beneath
his
breath
to
which
he
picked
out
an
accompaniment
on
the
mandolin
she
lay
back
gazing
up
at
him
above
a
wooded
knoll
the
moon
rose
setting
the
river
trees
knelt
along
the
banks
like
cattle
stooping
to
drink
in
the
distance
the
bridge
leapt
the
chasm
of
darkness
and
lights
of
the
town
sprang
up
like
a
fleet
of
dreams
against
green
wharfs
of
fairyland
illumined
houseboats
shone
fantastic
chains
of
lamps
strung
through
boughs
of
gardens
gleamed
like
jewels
on
the
throat
of
the
dusk
the
river
sang
incoherently
in
a
voice
that
was
half
asleep
peter
slipped
his
hand
into
cherry
her
hand
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
and
now
they
drew
near
to
the
crowd
of
which
jostled
one
another
and
beat
the
water
like
a
run
of
salmon
in
shallows
harry
laid
aside
the
pole
and
took
to
the
paddle
they
lit
their
candles
and
flew
their
heraldry
in
their
disguises
no
one
would
know
them
with
the
restraint
of
their
identities
lifted
from
them
they
scarcely
recognized
themselves
the
faun
man
gave
the
word
the
punt
was
allowed
to
drift
they
all
struck
up
away
go

they
tickled
the
people
fancy
they
were
so
obviously
out
for
a
lark
and
so
evidently
intended
to
have
it
when
bloke
a
was
sung
from
bank
to
bank
the
chorus
was
taken
up
even
the
strollers
hanging
over

the
faun
man
turned
to
the
golden
woman
and
addressed
the
words
to
her
shamelessly
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
drew
her
head
down
against
his
shoulder
through
the
slits
in
her
mask
her
eyes
gleamed
up
peter
watching
wondered
why
it
was
that
she
would
only
be
kind
to
him
in
fun
he
had
noticed
that
when
the
faun
man
was
in
earnest
she
never
responded
they
had
been
singing
for
an
hour
pushed
this
way
and
that
too
jammed
to
attempt
steering
their
punt
had
drifted
near
a
all
with
lanterns
and
steep
with
flowers
through
the
windows
they
could
see
that
a
dinner
had
just
ended
tall
young
men
in
evening
dress
sprawled
back
in
chairs
corks
were
still
popping
the
faun
man
whispered
one
of
the
crews
breaking
training
what
we
give
oh
yes

do
tune
so
they
tuned
up
yer
gal
ai

and
for

they
make
you
why

for
that
the
way
love
started
adam
ended
wery
and
that
the
young
men
had
come
out
they
were
slightly
unsteady
some
of
them
found
difficulty
in
keeping
their
cigars
in
their
mouths
they
held
one
another
arms
and
laughed
loudly
their
faces
were
flushed
and
their
hair
ruffled
but
for
all
that
because
they
were
young
and
had
done
their
work
gamely
that
afternoon
they
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
atmosphere
of
carnival
a
voice
on
the
edge
of
the
darkness
shouted
one
word
the
crowd
stood
up
in
their
boats
and
commenced
to
cheer
from
the
group
of
crewmen
one
tall
fellow
was
pushed
forward
and
lifted
on
a
chair
he
looked
slim
as
a
girl
in
his
his
thin
rather
handsome
face
wore
a
weak
inconsequential
expression
when
the
babel
of
voices
had
died
down
he
spoke
thickly
and
hesitatingly
i
won
i
dunno
did
i
win
i
ca
remember
suppose
i
must
have
one
of
you
chaps
tell
me
anyway
if
i
did
win
here
to
the
losers
plucky
devils
cherry
had
been
leaning
forward
her
mask
had
slipped
aside
in
her
eagerness
hardcastle
saw
her
he
stared
made
an
effort
to
pull
his
wits
together
in
a
second
he
had
jumped
from
the
chair
had
caught
her
by
the
hand
was
helping
her
aboard
the
she
held
on
to
peter
laughing
and
dragging
him
after
her
the
others
followed
reluctantly
after
all
they
were
out
for
adventure
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
the
cabin
hardcastle
slipped
his
arms
about
her
and
swung
her
up
on
to
the
table
amid
the
clatter
of
breaking
glasses
you
little
beauty
sing
the
faun
man
pushed
his
way
forward
the
matter
was
going
beyond
a
joke
his
intention
was
to
stop
it
the
golden
woman
clutched
him
make
a
row
lorie
they
do
know
who
we
are
we
let
ourselves
in
for
it
let
go
through
with
it
like
cherry
seemed
not
at
all
offended
the
spirit
of
bacchanalia
possessed
her
her
usually
pale
face
had
a
pretty
flush
she
stood
tiptoe
her
red
lips
pouting
watching
through
the
slits
in
her
mask
these
fine
young
animals
whom
the
river
had
applauded
her
eyes
came
back
to
do
want
to
it
was
like
a
shy
child
talking
you
like
i
in
a
trice
hardcastle
had
lifted
her
again
in
his
arms
to
balance
herself
she
had
to
cling
to
his
neck
and
shoulders
the
table
he
shouted
with
his
free
hand
he
commenced
tugging
at
the
cloth
others
helped
him
with
a
jangle
and
smash
that
could
be
heard
across
the
river
silver
glass
and
lighted
candles
were
swept
to
the
floor
he
set
her
back
on
the
polished
surface
and
ran
to
the
piano
in
the
corner
crying
tickle
the
ivories
you
with
his
head
turned
he
played
and
watched
her
from
the
ruin
she
had
caught
up
a
red
rose
and
held
it
between
her
red
lips
by
the
stalk
her
feet
began
to
move
slowly
at
first
then
wildly
she
swayed
and
tossed
glided
stealthily
bent
and
shot
upward
like
a
dart
her
breath
was
coming
fast
all
the
while
her
gray
eyes
sought
the
man
who
watched
her
across
his
shoulder
the
other
men
were
infected
by
her
madness
they
took
hands
and
circled
the
table
singing
whatever
came
into
their
heads
to
peter
it
was
torture
he
thought
that
she
knew
it
he
guessed
that
she
had
done
it
on
purpose
he
had
wearied
her
with
his
respect
he
remembered
one
of
the
faun
man
sayings
woman
likes
to
be
respected
she
prefers
to
be
loved
even
by
a
man
whom
she
the
piano
stopped
hardcastle
leapt
up
i
want
to
see
no
cried
cherry
do
and
i
will
he
retorted
he
had
stumbled
against
the
table
and
caught
her
by
the
knees
his
hands
were
groping
up
to
tear
aside
her
mask
an
arm
shot
out
he
staggered
another
blow
struck
him
between
the
eyes
he
measured
his
length
on
the
floor
peter
dragged
cherry
to
him
pressing
her
against
him
all
was
hubbub
the
faun
man
and
harry
were
on
either
side
of
him
forming
a
guard
of
a
sudden
the
lights
went
out
some
one
had
knocked
over
the
lamps
in
the
darkness
the
sound
of
scuffling
subsided
the
faun
man
voice
was
heard
saying
here
you
chaps
that
was
very
decent
of
hardcastle
he
drunk
so
say
no
more
about
it
but
you
gentlemen
let
us
out
we
as
they
stepped
into
the
night
cherry
felt
warm
lips
touch
her
forehead
she
heard
protesting
voices
and
one
which
whispered
get
off
with
her
we
the
punt
stole
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
river
when
she
lifted
her
head
from
the
cushions
she
found
that
the
ripples
on
the
water
were
and
that
a
solitary
figure
was
seated
in
the
stern
paddling
chapter
xxxi
a
night
with
the
moon
he
was
taking
her
in
the
wrong
direction
why
to
reach
the
red
lion
he
should
have
steered
upstream
far
behind
chiseled
out
by
the
moonlight
the
town
stood
sharp
against
the
sky
sagging
roofs
twisted
and
tall
spires
from
its
walls
came
the
shouts
of
roisterers
and
the
sound
of
discordant
singing
which
broke
off
abruptly
only
to
commence
again
more
faintly
she
was
inclined
to
be
penitent
she
was
both
annoyed
and
amused
with
herself
for
what
she
had
done
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
she
was
always
doing
wild
things
like
that
to
people
she
cared
for
doing
them
that
she
might
measure
their
love
by
her
power
to
hurt
them
she
wondered
whether
he
blamed
her
and
how
long
he
would
keep
silent
the
river
had
become
a
pathway
of
ebony
inlaid
with
silver
by
the
moonlight
along
its
banks
illuminations
smoldered
scorching
red
wounds
in
the
shadows
here
and
there
a
candle
flared
sank
and
died
like
a
heart
which
had
broken
itself
with
longing
craft
drifted
like
logs
through
the
blackness
they
seemed
deserted
unpiloted
yet
they
bore
with
them
the
sense
of
lips
that
whispered
against
other
lips
and
of
hands
that
touched
everything
seemed
to
say
but
there
is
still
lovers
would
have
vanished
faces
which
in
the
past
week
one
had
learnt
to
recognize
about
which
one
had
built
up
fancies
would
be
seen
no
more
the
haunting
poignancy
of
parting
was
in
the
night
the
memory
of
things
exquisite
and
unlasting
and
peter
he
could
understand
what
had
happened
to
him
it
seemed
a
dream
from
which
he
was
waking
he
wanted
to
sleep
again
and
recapture
the
illusion
from
the
first
he
had
recognized
an
atmosphere
of
danger
in
her
presence
she
was
so
foreign
to
his
experience
it
was
scarcely
likely
that
a
friendship
with
her
would
lead
to
happiness
and
yet
he
could
not
do
without
her
on
those
sunlit
mornings
aboard
when
he
had
opened
his
eyes
to
hear
the
river
tapping
had
looked
out
of
his
window
to
see
the
breeze
whipping
the
water
and
the
plumed
trees
nodding
there
had
been
no
rest
in
the
day
gladness
till
he
had
heard
her
tripping
footsteps
she
had
crept
into
his
blood
all
past
things
were
unremembered
past
ambitions
and
past
loyalties
every
beauty
grouped
itself
about
her
the
grayness
of
her
eyes
drew
his
soul
out
the
soft
slurring
notes
of
her
voice
were
for
him
the
finest
music
had
he
been
offered
the
joy
of
one
month
with
her
for
which
all
the
years
of
his
life
should
be
forfeit
he
would
willingly
have
accepted
the
thought
of
marriage
had
already
occurred
to
him
that
he
should
be
only
nineteen
was
a
tragedy
would
she
wait
for
him
with
no
more
than
a
week
acquaintance
by
which
to
judge
he
knew
that
she
would
wait
for
no
one
she
was
elusive
one
moment
a
child
the
next
a
woman
and
she
sat
there
gazing
at
him
through
the
shadows
her
hands
folded
meekly
on
her
breast
a
nunlike
trick
which
she
had
learnt
at
the
convent
it
gave
her
an
appearance
of
piety
which
the
red
defiance
of
her
mouth
and
gray
challenge
of
her
eyes
negatived
she
was
the
first
woman
he
had
loved
he
loved
her
uncalculatingly
with
his
soul
and
body
as
a
man
loves
but
once
when
he
is
young
they
had
passed
and
were
nearing
the
island
all
the
other
boats
were
left
behind
her
voice
came
to
him
throbbingly
like
a
harp
fingered
softly
disappointed
in
me
you
often
be
he
could
not
bear
that
she
should
blame
herself
he
drew
in
his
paddle
not
only
what
a
man
always
says
when
he
trying
to
deceive
why
did
you
do
it
she
did
answer
his
question
how
could
she
tell
why
because
she
was
young
because
she
knew
that
she
was
pretty
looked
splendid
she
said
you
struck
and
then
she
mentioned
the
one
thing
concerning
which
he
as
a
man
would
have
kept
silent
kissed
me
his
blood
quickened
was
she
reproaching
him
or
simply
saying
love
me
we
alone
together
she
was
leaning
forward
now
looking
away
from
him
her
throat
resting
against
the
back
of
her
hand
he
crept
toward
her
knelt
at
her
feet
and
pressed
his
lips
against
her
dress
her
eyes
came
back
to
him
better
go
away
and
forget
he
slipped
his
arm
about
her
body
drawing
her
to
him
you
want
me
to
go
away
to
go
out
of
your
life
forever
the
word
was
whispered
and
slowly
uttered
she
touched
him
gently
patting
his
hand
i
not
your
sort
you
know
you
are
my
sort
or
else
how
could
i
feel
feel
what
i
am
feeling
you
learn
to
love
me
she
took
it
without
a
tremor
this
declaration
which
had
cost
him
such
effort
she
shook
her
head
faun
man
tells
eve
that
every
time
they
together
i
wonder
how
many
men
have
said
it
love
comes
in
an
instant
you
ca
learn
why
not
she
bent
over
him
like
a
mother
her
mouth
was
rounded
no
wonder
they
called
her
cherry
she
was
adorable
in
compassion
do
know
me
i
not
at
all
what
you
think
ask
the
faun
man
do
you
remember
at
the
happy
cottage
it
was
for
breaking
his
pictures
that
he
sent
me
to
the
i
make
you
love
me
he
insisted
do
know
what
i
do
for
you
i
die
for
you
cherry
there
nothing
about
you
that
i
worship
you
so
long
and
sweet
and
he
laid
his
face
against
her
cold
white
cheek
and
caught
his
breath
she
was
like
marble
he
could
feel
no
stir
in
her
and
his
every
nerve
was
throbbing
you
like
to
be
loved
she
seemed
to
marvel
at
his
passion
as
if
it
were
a
thing
which
she
did
not
understand
by
which
she
was
puzzled
oddly
to
his
way
of
thinking
she
showed
no
terror
of
him
her
eyes
dwelt
on
him
with
clear
and
kindly
interest
girl
likes
to
be
loved
but
that
different
i
think
you
ever
teach
me
peter
and
yet
had
we
better
be
getting
back
not
he
felt
that
he
was
going
to
lose
her
lose
her
forever
surely
surely
he
could
rouse
her
to
a
sense
of
the
poetry
and
drama
which
was
burning
in
his
blood
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
not
feel
it
she
had
been
sleeping
as
he
had
been
sleeping
letting
love
go
by
with
its
banners
and
drums
not
yet
he
pleaded
these
years
we
lived
we
hardly
ever
been
she
broke
the
suspense
by
laughing
your
favorite
hymn
peter
he
was
puzzled
got
one
never
thought
about
it
what
makes
you
ask
she
wriggled
her
shoulders
mine
not
to
temptation
he
did
catch
the
significance
of
her
remark
she
saw
that
a
little
boy
are
you
a
little
boy
of
nineteen
who
thinks
he
in
love
there
are
heaps
of
other
girls
in
the
yes
i
he
piled
the
cushions
for
her
then
took
the
paddle
and
seated
himself
so
he
could
face
her
their
conversation
was
carried
on
by
fits
and
starts
with
long
pauses
was
a
she
spoke
reflectively
was
i
thought
i
was
afraid
you
liked
she
trailed
her
hand
in
the
black
water
watching
how
it
slipped
through
her
fingers
did
like
him
for
the
moment
that
proves
i
not
nice
women
often
like
men
who
are
you
do
like
him
now
she
teased
him
keeping
him
waiting
glad
you
struck
presently
she
said
i
been
thinking
why
ca
we
have
good
times
together
we
could
be
friends
and
nothing
serious
but
more
than
exactly
friends
lots
of
girls

peter
stopped
paddling
should
have
to
love
you
i
should
be
always
hoping
that
it
would
be
fair
to
you
she
said
he
had
been
silent
for
some
minutes
did
you
learn
so
much
about
men
i
know
nothing
about
did
i
learn
she
laughed
know
without
learning
until
no
man
ever
kissed
me
not
the
way
you
kissed
me
so
you
need
be
the
punt
nosed
its
way
among
rushes
and
came
to
rest
he
crouched
against
her
feet
holding
her
hands
trembling
at
her
nearness
the
deep
stillness
of
the
night
enfolded
them
reeds
stood
up
tall
on
every
side
shutting
out
the
world
above
their
heads
a
flock
of
fleecy
clouds
wandered
with
unseen
shepherds
swinging
stars
for
lanterns
the
man
in
the
moon
looked
out
of
his
window
with
a
tolerant
smile
on
his
mouth
she
lay
against
the
cushions
white
and
impassive
her
long
fine
throat
stretched
back
she
said
up
there
those
clouds
they
do
know
where
they
going
someone
driving
them
from
one
world
to
another
like
sheep
to
pasture
we
like
that
someone
driving
us
and
we
do
know
where
we
and
then
love
me
with
all
your
heart
yes
i
believe
that
and
i
i
love
someone
else
we
each
love
someone
who
does
care
and
i
have
to
let
you
do
it
i
who
know
the
pain
of
it
poor
peter
what
a
pity
god
did
make
us
so
that
we
could
love
each
and
again
do
know
any
man
in
the
world
with
whom
i
trust
myself
to
do
what
we
doing
oh
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
peter
if
ever
i
should
hurt
you
you
remember
he
could
speak
did
want
to
speak
he
and
she
were
awake
and
together
while
all
the
world
slept
that
was
sufficient
how
still
it
was
he
could
hear
the
soft
intake
of
her
breath
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
this
is
love
he
kept
saying
to
himself
it
was
at
all
what
he
had
expected
it
was
a
wild
rush
of
words
and
an
eager
clutching
of
hands
it
was
an
extravagance
of
actions
and
language
it
was
just
tenderness
he
unbent
her
fingers
marveling
at
their
frailness
he
pressed
the
palm
of
her
hand
against
his
mouth
he
felt
like
a
little
child
as
he
sat
beside
this
silent
girl
cherry
lifted
herself
on
the
cushions
she
gave
him
both
her
hands
is
it
she
seemed
afraid
when
she
spoke
her
voice
trembled
two
people
are
married
is
it
always
one
who
allows
and
one
who
loves
you
know
you
ca
tell
me
if
both
do
love
it
must
be
terrible
i
could
bear
only
to
give
everything
and
only
to
take
everything
that
would
be
worse
oh
peter
i
have
to
tell
you
it
was
like
that
with
my
mother
she
could
give
everything
to
my
father
and
then
she
found
someone
else
my
father
worshiped
her
just
as
you
worship
me
peter
when
he
knew
that
she
was
going
away
from
him
he
he
kept
she
covered
her
face
was
hanged
for
it
and
that
why
the
faun
man
he
was
his
friend
oh
i
afraid
of
myself
i
almost
wish
never
he
held
her
to
him
she
was
shaken
with
sobbing
suddenly
he
recalled
how
he
had
first
seen
her
rushing
out
of
the
happy
cottage
with
her
hair
tumbled
about
her
white
face
and
her
gray
eyes
wide
with
tragedy
she
was
so
wilful
and
she
so
needed
protection
cherry
do
be
frightened
do
cry
dear
i
love
you
nothing
like
that
could
ever
happen
to
she
stared
at
him
like
that
could
ever
happen
i
expect
they
said
they
and
was
it
they
who
had
called
her
cherry
because
her
lips
were
red
her
eyes
closed
her
lashes
were
wet
beneath
them
were
shadows
he
gazed
on
her
clasping
her
to
him
tenderly
as
though
she
were
a
bewildered
bird
which
had
flown
blindly
into
his
breast
her
breath
came
softly
he
thought
her
sleeping
and
kissed
her
mouth
her
hand
sought
his
and
lay
there
trustingly
what
pictures
he
had
of
her
he
saw
her
dancing
before
the
flushed
and
foolish
faces
of
those
men
he
saw
her
as
he
had
met
her
on
the
bridge
in
her
cool
blowy
summer
dress
he
saw
her
in
the
haunted
wood
where
the
little
river
ran
bidding
him
turn
back
because
of
what
she
had
just
told
him
he
felt
that
he
had
never
loved
her
until
now
like
a
counterpane
tucking
in
the
sleepy
stars
the
mist
of
dawn
crept
up
near
into
the
bank
behind
the
wall
of
rushes
a
was
splashing
the
countryside
whispered
with
creature
sounds
a
bird
was
calling
how
long
had
it
been
calling
an
owl
flew
over
his
head
in
haste
to
keep
pace
with
the
retreat
of
darkness
along
the
east
above
the
spears
of
the
reeds
a
little
redness
spread
a
thrush
tried
over
a
few
staves
before
he
had
burst
in
song
a
perky
blackbird
was
piping
valiantly
the
fields
fluttered
as
though
a
messenger
ran
through
them
telling
to
raise
their
heads
the
east
smoldered
higher
conflagration
smoked
sideways
and
upward
a
door
opened
in
a
cloud
the
sun
stepped
out
like
the
unhurried
crash
of
an
orchestra
the
world
shouted
it
happened
every
morning
while
men
slept
it
was
stupendous
appalling
how
white
she
was
he
bent
over
her
her
eyes
opened
she
gave
his
arm
a
little
hug
you
kissing
me
peter
you
must
must
love
me
like
ah
must
it
was
too
late
to
forbid
him
the
insanity
of
the
night
was
all
forgotten
only
its
sweetness
was
left
from
his
window
the
man
in
the
moon
looked
down
his
mouth
seemed
to
droop
at
the
corners
he
would
watch
for
them
next
night
and
they
would
not
come
he
might
never
know
the
end
of
their
story
he
was
despondent
he
had
to
go
to
bed
peter
was
chafing
her
hands
good
you
are
good
only
in
and
she
dreamt
of
you
we
were
in
the
haunted
wood
my
feet
were
bare
and
he
held
her
eyes
earnestly
wish
i
had
been
there
all
these
years
it
was
the
grayness
of
your
eyes
and
and
something
else
that
i
else
no
tell
whiteness
of
your
feet
he
whispered
again
they
were
in
fairyland
yellow
as
a
topaz
set
in
turquoise
the
sun
stood
free
in
the
heavens
inhabitants
of
the
fearless
morning
went
busily
about
their
tasks
clear
as
a
mirror
through
the
perfumed
stillness
of
meadows
the
river
ran
mists
curled
from
ofif
its
surface
and
hung
white
in
within
fish
leapt
peering
over
the
side
of
the
punt
they
could
follow
their
retreat
through
waving
weeds
and
black
only
a
magpie
noticed
their
passage
and
became
interested
fluttering
from
bough
to
bough
and
asking
them
want
what
want
ventured
forth
as
the
sun
heat
strengthened
butterflies
and
the
teeming
insect
world
rose
out
of
and
foxgloves
out
of
the
destructible
homes
which
nature
builds
for
their
brief
and
perishable
existence
he
and
she
drifting
through
the
golden
quiet
with
clasped
hands
seized
their
moment
unquestioningly
and
were
thankful
for
it
ahead
they
saw
swans
then
cattle
wading
rounding
a
bend
they
came
in
sight
of
a
trellised
garden
with
green
tables
set
out
on
a
lawn
boats
swung
idly
in
the
stream
tethered
to
a
landing
in
the
background
was
a
thatched
house
from
whose
chimney
smoke
waved
back
in
a
thin
plume
when
they
came
near
enough
they
made
out
a
white
post
with
a
sign
swinging
from
it
on
the
sign
was
depicted
a
brown
bird
fluttering
its
wings
in
a
golden
cage
painted
over
it
were
the
words
winged
in
lifting
their
eyes
to
read
the
sign
they
caught
sight
of
the
faint
moon
weakly
smiling
as
though
saying
got
to
go
they
wo
let
me
stay
goodbye
and
good
they
landed
leaving
their
foolish
disguises
in
the
punt
through
the
wistfulness
of
summer
roses
they
approached
the
inn
and
entered
the
room
was
strewn
with
sawdust
and
stale
with
the
smell
of
beer
and
tobacco
an
person
with
a
face
and
little
blue
pig
eyes
met
them
they
asked
for
breakfast
he
knew
his
business
well
enough
to
suggest
that
missie
would
prefer
to
have
it
in
an
arbor
while
they
ate
he
hovered
round
them
continually
inventing
excuses
to
interrupt
their
privacy
he
reminded
them
of
the
magpie
in
his
frank
display
of
curiosity
he
informed
them
that
trade
was
wery
bad
a
mind
to
try
luck
in
australy
if
it
were
for
the
young
bloods
from
henley
he
take
a
from
month
to
month
did
they
know
of
anyone
an
artist
chap
for
who
like
to
combine
pleasure
with
business
by
tryin
his
at
runnin
a
nice
pub
an
artist
chap
could
paint
that
bloomin
bird
out
and
call
the
place
the
white
hart
or
somethin
whoever
of
an
inn
which
was
called
the
winged
thrush
people
did
want
their
meals
messed
about
by
a
bloomin
poet
not
but
what
the
sitiyation
was
so
pleasant
that
he
tried
to
write
poetry
for
the
most
part
his
verses
allaws
came
to
when
were
groomin
the
if
things
did
brisk
up
give
australy
a
chance
as
many
times
promised
at
last
he
left
them
cherry
gazed
out
dreamily
across
the
river
wonder
is
it
true
that
one
has
always
to
pay
with
sorrow
for
happiness
peter
shivered
how
old
she
could
be
when
she
chose
to
borrow
other
people
disillusions
he
tried
to
restore
her
to
cheerfulness
a
pagan
notion
it
the
old
idea
of
the
gods
being
jealous
you
think
such
happiness
does
bring
sorrow
she
insisted
shall
have
to
pay
for
this
and
and
her
voice
trailed
off
giving
him
a
vision
of
all
the
tomorrows
when
he
would
be
without
her
and
he
was
sure
of
her
she
had
told
him
that
she
did
love
him
he
drew
her
closer
a
sorrow
crown
of
sorrows
is
to
have
no
happier
things
to
remember
to
be
old
and
never
to
have
been
young
to
be
lonely
and
never
to
have
been
loved
you
mournful
little
person
do
you
think
you
be
any
happier
because
you
never
known
happiness
do
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
touch
of
defiance
not
clever
i
ca
then
her
face
clearing
as
suddenly
as
it
had
clouded
ca
think
why
you
like
me
he
laughed
gladly
i
ca
tell
you
cherry
it
as
though
waited
for
you
always
without
knowing
for
whom
i
was
waiting
i
was
a
kind
of
winged
thrush
in
a
golden
cage
but
you
opened
the
door
now
you
his
explanation
was
sufficient
she
snuggled
her
chin
against
the
back
of
her
hand
and
watched
him
seriously
as
though
she
suspected
him
of
hiding
something
what
is
it
that
you
like
most
about
me
he
tried
to
discover
he
dug
back
into
his
own
sensations
what
was
it
that
he
liked
most
about
her
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
put
it
into
language
then
he
thought
he
might
find
out
by
examining
the
white
face
with
the
red
lips
and
tragic
eyes
of
the
who
had
asked
the
question
what
an
uncanny
faculty
she
had
for
stillness
a
sunbeam
falling
from
the
leaves
above
crept
up
her
slender
throat
and
nestled
in
her
hair
he
shook
his
head
just
you
cherry
your
voice
your
eyes
the
way
you
walk
the
way
you
try
to
be
sad
it
just
you
and
your
sweetness
cherry
i
think
if
i
did
love
you
so
much
i
could
say
it
she
stood
up
poor
boy
you
said
it
well
enough
i
wish
i
could
feel
like
and
now
we
should
be
they
had
stepped
outside
the
arbor
they
halted
at
the
sound
of
voices
coming
round
the
bend
was
a
scratch
eight
the
oars
striking
the
water
raggedly
the
men
were
joking
and
laughing
the
cox
a
pipe
hanging
from
his
mouth
was
urging
them
to
spurt
with
humorous
insults
having
landed
they
tumbled
into
their
sweaters
and
came
strolling
through
the
garden
they
were
discussing
the
previous
night
in
careless
voices
you
hear
about
hardcastle
when
he
is
in
training
he
always
like
that
ugh
at
six
a
hero
by
midnight
a
swine
you
care
to
the
voices
passed
out
of
earshot
cherry
turned
to
peter
i
let
him
touch
me
i
have
known
by
instinct
if
i
been
nice
oh
peter
you
must
love
when
he
attempted
to
kiss
her
she
refused
to
allow
it
saying
not
your
paddling
back
between
flowering
banks
where
trees
cast
deep
shadows
and
birds
sang
she
again
became
tender
just
a
yesterday
peter
a
continual
bidding
and
coming
back
from
her
sadness
hurt
him
she
knew
it
she
told
herself
that
it
would
always
hurt
him
he
did
want
ever
to
say
to
her
and
she
she
felt
sure
that
their
comradeship
would
be
always
finding
a
new
ending
darling
he
reproached
her
go
in
search
of
unhappiness
life
a
as
well
as
a
yesterday
it
full
of
splendid
things
things
which
are
expected
we
all
the
before
she
trailed
her
hand
in
the
water
snatching
at
the
lilies
as
if
by
an
effort
so
slight
she
could
delay
their
progress
and
prolong
the
present
she
did
lift
her
eyes
when
she
whispered
was
thinking
of
that
of
all
the
before
again
her
words
brought
a
vision
of
the
long
road
of
future
days
down
which
he
would
walk
without
her
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
surely
she
would
learn
to
love
him
reluctantly
he
paddled
forward
to
their
place
of
parting
chapter
xxxii
if
you
wo
come
to
heaven
then
the
train
swung
down
the
shining
rails
and
rumbled
into
paddington
passengers
pulled
down
their
parcels
from
the
racks
jumped
out
and
disappeared
in
the
crowd
peter
sat
on
this
carriage
at
least
had
known
her
she
had
looked
in
through
its
window
and
had
waved
her
hand
out
there
in
the
wilderness
of
london
there
was
nothing
they
had
shared
a
porter
looked
in
at
the
door
do
go
no
further
sir
lend
you
a
want
a
keb
in
the
cab
peter
closed
his
eyes
shutting
out
the
cheerful
grime
of
streets
the
nipped
impertinence
of
cockney
faces
the
monotonous
anonymity
of
the
ceaseless
procession
the
stench
of
this
vast
human
stable
where
lives
were
stalled
and
broken
he
was
trying
to
get
back
to
green
banks
to
a
river
molten
in
the
sunset
and
to
a
redlipped
girl
was
she
thinking
of
him
if
they
thought
of
one
another
at
the
same
moment
could
their
thoughts
meet
and
interchange
but
she
did
love
him
oh
the
things
he
had
left
unsaid
the
things
he
would
say
to
make
her
love
him
now
if
she
sat
beside
him
she
had
spoken
truly
happiness
had
to
be
paid
for
with
sorrow
his
share
of
the
paying
had
commenced
and
hers
would
she
dodge
payment
by
forgetting
the
law
of
change
was
cruel
it
diminished
all
things
even
the
most
sacred
to
mere
incidents
in
a
passing
pageant
a
pigmy
charioteer
with
the
futile
hands
of
imagination
he
was
making
the
old
foolish
endeavor
to
rein
in
time
stallions
he
pictured
himself
as
painted
on
a
frieze
with
her
in
the
moment
of
their
supreme
elation
the
moment
when
attainment
had
been
certain
just
before
it
was
realized
the
frieze
should
represent
a
meadow
in
the
early
morning
a
river
with
mists
rising
from
off
it
and
a
boy
stooping
his
lips
over
the
naked
feet
of
a
girl
someone
else
had
uttered
the
same
fancy
youth
beneath
the
trees
thou
canst
not
leave
thy
song
nor
ever
can
those
trees
be
bare
bold
lover
never
never
canst
thou
kiss
though
winning
near
the
goal
yet
do
not
grieve
she
can
not
can
not
already
it
seemed
that
the
sharp
edges
of
his
memories
were
lost
to
him
how
was
it
that
her
face
lit
up
how
did
her
voice
shudder
and
slur
from
sudden
piping
notes
into
tenderness
how
things
grew
vague
he
had
meant
to
treasure
them
so
poignantly
like
a
dream
from
which
against
his
will
he
was
waking
illusion
gathered
in
her
skirts
from
his
clutching
hands
growing
faint
against
the
background
of
reality
the
waking
had
commenced
before
he
left
henley
on
his
return
to
he
had
found
a
note
waiting
him
it
had
been
forwarded
from
topbury
his
name
and
address
were
printed
evidently
to
disguise
the
hand
of
the
sender
inside
on
a
half
sheet
of
was
scrawled
god
sake
meet
me
seven
at
the
bottom
of
the
crescent
i
it
was
signed
with
the
initials
so
he
was
out
of
jail
looking
at
the
date
of
the
postmark
peter
had
discovered
that
for
two
nights
the
man
who
was
lonely
had
waited
in
the
four
and
a
half
years
since
he
had
vanished
from
the
living
world
his
name
had
been
scarcely
mentioned
at
topbury
the
effort
had
been
made
to
blot
out
disgrace
by
forgetting
jehane
when
she
had
left
sandport
had
purposely
dropped
her
old
acquaintance
and
had
passed
among
recent
friends
as
a
widow
the
fiction
had
been
so
earnestly
cultivated
that
it
had
seemed
almost
true
that
ocky
waffles
was
dead
true
even
to
peter
and
glory
now
like
the
remembered
tragedy
about
a
when
the
hands
had
been
long
since
folded
flowers
placed
upon
the
breast
and
the
coffin
carried
out
the
dead
man
had
come
back
to
die
afresh
to
say
that
peter
resented
his
return
would
be
an
exaggeration
but
he
shrank
from
the
intrusion
of
the
sordid
past
upon
the
golden
poetry
of
the
present
shrank
from
it
as
he
would
shrink
from
meeting
someone
hideously
marred
in
a
gay
spring
woodland
the
cab
wheels
caught
in
the
and
jerked
him
into
consciousness
of
his
whereabouts
they
had
turned
into
the
high
street
in
three
minutes
they
would
be
at
topbury
cock
and
then
already
in
the
distance
he
could
see
where
the
in
the
fields
commenced
what
should
he
do
if
his
uncle
were
standing
there
his
father
house
no
he
raised
the
trap
in
the
roof
you
come
to
the
bottom
of
the
crescent
walk
your
horse
understand
shops
were
closing
girls
and
men
were
pouring
out
on
to
the
pavement
meeting
with
a
quick
flash
of
eyes
and
strolling
away
together
some
of
them
boarded
trams
going
up
to
highgate
to
breathe
the
evening
air
the
sun
was
setting
the
horse
slowed
down
at
the
corner
a
crowd
was
gathered
about
a
band
people
were
singing
peter
caught
the
words
you
wo
come
to
heaven
then
you
have
to
go
to
hell
for
the
devil
he
is
waiting
but
with
jesus
all
is
well
though
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
he
will
wash
them
in
his
blood
so
hurry
up
to
jesus
and
he
make
you
good
hallelujah
grace
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
banging
on
her
drum
her
mouth
wide
open
in
her
big
on
the
lolling
on
his
box
pretending
to
be
half
asleep
sat
grace
his
daughter
eyes
were
on
him
peter
scanned
the
crowd
it
was
composed
of
idlers
onlookers
and
scoffers
with
a
sprinkling
of
converts
the
converts
were
noticeable
by
their
pale
indignant
enthusiasm
at
first
he
saw
no
one
who
attracted
his
attention
and
then
a
man
with
dejected
shoulders
was
crouching
in
the
gateway
of
a
house
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
be
unobserved
his
clothes
were
shabby
out
of
fashion
his
linen
was
soiled
it
was
the
dirty
white
spats
above
his
unshone
boots
that
made
peter
notice
he
told
the
cabby
to
wait
for
him
he
walked
by
the
man
once
in
passing
he
noted
the
total
slovenliness
of
his
appearance
the
unkempt
hands
the
defeated
air
and
the
hat
jammed
down
to
hide
the
hair
he
turned
back
and
was
repassing
like
a
whipped
dog
the
man
raised
his
eyes
then
instantly
lowered
them
peter
held
out
his
hand
his
throat
was
too
choked
to
say
anything
the
man
seemed
about
to
take
it
then
slunk
back
do
want
to
know
do
if
i
had
i
should
have
come
i
i
awfully
you
wo
come
to
heaven
then
you
have
to
go
to
hell
sang
grace
and
her
followers
it
sounded
as
though
they
were
passing
sentence
to
the
driver
amazement
peter
helped
him
into
the
hansom
us
round
for
an
hour
or
two
he
said
you
wo
come
to
heaven
then
you
have
to
go
to
the
singing
hurled
itself
after
them
seemed
to
be
running
and
to
grow
out
of
breath
as
they
drew
into
the
distance
they
set
off
through
holloway
they
reached
the
foot
of
highgate
hill
and
had
not
spoken
ahead
blazed
the
dome
of
joseph
catching
the
redness
of
the
sinking
sun
the
cabby
asked
for
further
instructions
up
the
hill
and
out
to
waterlow
park
brought
a
breath
of
country
children
were
laughing
and
playing
there
the
sternness
of
the
city
like
the
brutality
of
just
judgments
was
dropping
away
behind
them
streets
took
on
a
village
aspect
over
to
the
left
within
sound
of
the
living
children
lay
the
where
little
philip
rested
the
horse
clambered
slowly
to
the
top
of
the
ascent
peter
touched
the
knee
of
the
man
beside
him
glad
you
sent
for
me
it
it
a
long
time
since
we
met
i
mean
what
i
mean
to
say
is
you
might
have
forgotten
me
i
glad
you
long
time
since
we
met
the
dull
eyes
stared
at
him
as
lifelessly
as
through
a
pair
of
smoked
glasses
been
buried
they
better
have
dug
a
hole
for
the
man
paused
and
looked
from
side
to
side
stealthily
he
had
the
hoarse
prison
voice
which
whispered
and
cracked
it
was
painful
to
see
how
he
cringed
and
shrank
he
pulled
himself
together
and
laughed
huskily
did
let
us
speak
in
he
spoke
reflectively
as
if
to
himself
for
more
than
four
years
strange
to
be
back
they
were
bowling
down
a
smooth
road
to
the
right
were
and
boys
at
the
nets
across
the
blue
stillness
of
evening
came
the
sharp
of
balls
against
bats
this
is
uncle
waffles
so
this
is
uncle
waffles
peter
kept
saying
to
himself
his
thoughts
searched
back
trying
to
trace
a
resemblance
between
the
irrepressible
joking
companion
of
his
childhood
and
this
mutilated
scrap
of
humanity
the
voice
crawled
on
like
the
sound
of
dragging
footsteps
could
have
done
anything
bad
enough
to
deserve
that
if
i
only
known
that
someone
outside
was
caring
there
were
no
letters
no
no
anything
just
to
get
up
in
the
morning
and
to
work
and
then
to
go
back
to
bed
sundays
were
the
worst
there
was
any
and
then
they
opened
the
gates
and
shoved
me
out
i
could
think
of
anyone
but
you
peter
made
an
attempt
to
cheer
him
could
have
thought
of
someone
the
man
shook
his
head
yes
but
you
could
there
was
he
showed
no
animation
eighteen
is
she
no
glory
would
care
but
jehane
how
is
she
peter
had
feared
that
question
the
man
looked
away
wo
want
to
see
me
she
never
loved
me
think
she
let
me
see
her
peter
afraid
afraid
she
would
she
thinking
of
eustace
and
moggs
and
riska
but
glory
i
sure
glory
glory
she
forgotten
me
and
jehane
she
never
thought
of
me
it
was
always
of
the
his
voice
fell
slack
with
utter
hopelessness
peter
remembered
words
always
one
who
allows
and
one
who
jehane
even
allowed
the
ruin
at
his
side
was
her
handiwork
the
hansom
halted
hampstead
heath
was
all
about
them
falling
away
in
gorse
and
bracken
and
yellow
earth
a
little
farther
on
was
the
flagstaff
pond
toy
yachts
were
scudding
across
it
excited
boys
ran
round
its
edges
to
retrim
their
sails
and
send
their
craft
on
fresh
adventures
a
dog
jumped
into
the
water
barking
they
could
see
his
head
bobbing
as
he
swam
to
their
left
between
the
trees
of
the
vale
of
heath
london
lay
like
a
sunken
rock
with
the
surf
of
smoke
breaking
over
it
the
cabby
spoke
young
gentleman
my
is
tired
got
to
be
gettin
back
abart
a
rest
at
the
spaniards
they
returned
over
the
way
they
had
come
the
tall
firs
of
the
seven
sisters
stood
up
black
and
before
them
in
the
yard
of
the
spaniards
they
stepped
out
the
cabby
climbed
down
and
began
to
unharness
behind
his
hand
he
said
to
peter
old
party
you
got
there
and
then
glancing
up
at
the
labels
on
the
bag
to
yer
luck
at
the
bar
peter
ordered
supper
in
a
private
room
he
noticed
that
when
they
had
sat
down
his
uncle
still
kept
his
hat
on
when
he
reminded
him
of
it
his
uncle
glanced
at
the
door
furtively
and
whispered
take
it
off
they
may
he
fell
upon
his
food
ravenously
in
his
eating
as
in
his
way
of
talking
there
was
something
inhuman
something
yes
lonely
was
the
word
slowly
it
was
coming
home
to
peter
that
through
all
these
years
while
he
had
been
housed
and
safeguarded
and
attended
with
affection
this
man
had
been
used
like
an
animal
he
was
repelled
and
filled
with
compassion
he
wanted
to
escape
he
was
unmanned
the
dusk
was
falling
be
back
in
a
moment
order
what
you
like
he
said
in
the
fragile
darkness
he
clenched
his
hands
last
night
he
had
been
so
happy
how
had
he
dared
to
be
happy
he
recalled
the
jolly
buffoonery
of
henley
the
songs
they
had
sung
the
swaying
of
lanterns
the
gliding
of
punts
the
muffled
laughter
the
hint
of
stolen
kisses
and
all
the
while
this
man
had
been
lonely
and
his
chief
fault
had
been
the
fault
of
others
that
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
love
peter
found
himself
walking
across
the
heath
following
no
path
now
and
then
the
rough
ground
tripped
him
and
he
stumbled
he
could
bear
the
reproach
of
that
that
thing
that
had
once
been
a
man
that
had
no
courage
left
to
accuse
anybody
peter
felt
as
though
he
himself
were
responsible
as
though
he
had
done
it
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
stars
indifferent
and
placid
stretched
out
on
the
couch
of
heaven
they
stared
back
at
him
and
told
him
cantingly
in
his
heaven
all
right
with
the
he
shook
his
fist
at
them
that
was
the
trouble
god
was
too
much
in
his
heaven
he
felt
that
he
could
never
again
be
happy
the
image
of
cherry
grew
up
cherry
with
her
red
mouth
god
had
made
her
as
well
he
unclenched
his
hands
and
stood
puzzled
god
had
made
her
as
well
the
golden
panes
of
the
inn
shone
and
winked
at
him
he
retraced
his
steps
the
man
still
wore
his
hat
but
alcohol
had
changed
him
from
a
thing
limp
and
hopeless
into
ocky
waffles
as
peter
entered
he
staggered
to
his
feet
with
both
hands
held
out
if
it
is
the
marvel
god
bless
me
how
he
grown
quite
a
man
peter
quite
a
man
he
put
his
lips
against
peter
ear
tell
anybody
they
would
understand
have
to
keep
it
he
pointed
to
his
hat
away
for
a
rest
cure
you
and
i
know
where
had
brain
fever
had
to
cut
my
hair
it
is
then
in
a
lower
voice
tell
anybody
you
wo
split
on
me
for
the
first
time
peter
was
delighted
to
find
his
uncle
drunk
he
assured
him
that
he
would
split
on
him
hands
old
son
it
a
compack
here
all
this
great
world
and
only
i
and
you
know
about
it
makes
me
laugh
our
little
joke
is
it
peter
took
the
whisky
bottle
from
him
do
want
any
more
of
the
trembling
hand
groped
after
it
the
weak
mouth
quivered
to
forget
just
to
make
me
forget
do
be
hard
on
poor
old
ocky
waffles
everyone
been
hard
on
ocky
for
a
moment
peter
wavered
then
poured
an
inch
more
of
liquid
courage
into
the
empty
glass
the
last
for
we
got
to
plan
for
your
future
ocky
waffles
twisted
his
unwaxed
mustaches
and
spread
his
arms
across
the
table
future
oh
yes
i
got
a
great
peter
tapped
him
on
the
hand
a
great
future
but
a
future
there
are
two
people
who
care
for
you
that
people
there
you
but
do
count
me
in
on
it
this
little
boy
is
very
fond
of
me
and
there
ocky
waffles
smiled
grimly
then
he
seemed
ashamed
of
himself
and
repeated
in
an
incredulous
whisper
cares
more
than
i
do
peter
said
and
i
and
you
all
working
together
do
you
understand
she
and
i
and
you
are
going
to
make
you
well
we
going
to
show
everybody
that
you
a
strong
good
man
and
we
going
to
work
in
secret
until
we
can
prove
strong
good
man
the
subject
of
this
wonderful
experiment
looked
down
at
himself
contemptuously
strong
good
man
i
think
you
said
likely
is
it
i
started
by
getting
with
sudden
loathing
and
concentrated
will
power
he
swept
the
glass
of
whisky
from
him
it
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
he
had
become
sober
and
rose
to
his
feet
solemnly
a
strong
good
man
i
could
have
been
once
i
a
i
got
my
memories
my
memories
good
god
i
would
tell
you
you
young
i
can
only
try
to
be
decent
now
if
that
enough
and
and
i
like
to
try
peter
if
you
help
as
they
drove
back
to
topbury
the
fumes
of
the
drink
overcame
him
he
fell
asleep
with
his
head
rolling
against
peter
shoulder
even
in
his
sleep
he
seemed
to
remember
his
shame
and
how
he
must
keep
it
hidden
from
the
world
his
hand
kept
traveling
to
his
hat
when
a
jerk
of
the
cab
threatened
to
remove
it
what
to
do
with
him
as
the
night
fled
by
him
peter
planned
no
one
but
peter
would
have
thought
out
a
plan
so
humanely
idiotic
the
silver
moonlight
fell
between
clumped
trees
and
flooded
all
the
meadows
houses
became
more
frequent
above
the
trotting
of
the
horse
the
grumble
of
traffic
was
heard
they
were
descending
hill
peter
put
his
arm
about
his
companion
to
prevent
his
slipping
forward
he
stirred
and
muttered
old
ocky
too
bad
too
bad
going
and
getting
drunk
just
out
of
prison
and
all
peter
bit
his
lips
and
drew
his
brows
together
life
how
strange
it
was
how
slender
and
fierce
and
pantherlike
and
cruel
and
yet
how
beautiful
at
times
and
splendid
who
could
foresee
anything
last
night
he
and
the
same
moon
had
gazed
on
romance
on
disillusion
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
lay
london
like
an
immense
quarry
tunneled
lamplit
treacherous
industrious
carved
out
of
the
precipice
of
darkness
it
seemed
a
clay
modeling
of
a
more
huge
world
placed
there
for
his
inspection
down
there
this
man
at
his
side
had
been
crushed
they
had
cast
him
out
they
had
told
him
you
wo
come
to
heaven
then
you
have
to
go
to
well
he
been
to
hell
and
now
got
to
take
him
back
in
his
heart
peter
dared
them
to
refuse
him
he
spoke
to
the
cabby
and
gave
him
an
address
the
man
complained
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
a
reward
persuaded
him
they
were
jingling
through
now
they
came
out
on
to
a
broad
road
with
trees
on
either
side
and
houses
standing
in
gardens
with
steps
going
up
to
them
the
horse
halted
and
the
cabman
blew
his
nose
loudly
little
jaunt
you
the
house
was
all
in
darkness
peter
rang
the
bell
on
the
second
story
a
blind
was
raised
someone
saw
the
lamps
of
the
hansom
feet
descended
the
stairs
the
door
opened
timidly
miss
florence
stood
there
her
hair
in
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
she
looked
extraordinarily
angular
and
elderly
behind
her
peering
over
the
banisters
were
miss
effie
miss
leah
and
miss
madge
with
petticoats
thrown
over
their
shoulders
peter
entered
the
hall
and
explained
his
errand
were
going
to
do
it
once
he
needs
it
more
than
ever
him
in
miss
florence
said
in
an
odd
room
he
undressed
his
uncle
and
slipped
him
into
one
of
the
late
jacobite
the
situation
was
not
without
its
humor
before
he
left
he
promised
to
be
round
early
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
he
arrived
home
at
topbury
terrace
only
his
father
was
up
he
opened
the
door
to
him
late
peter
we
thought
something
had
peter
waited
until
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
has
i
met
uncle
waffles
you
tired
do
let
talk
about
it
now
he
all
right
for
a
little
while
his
father
drew
a
long
breath
peter
knew
what
he
was
thinking
the
dead
man
has
come
back
to
die
afresh
they
put
out
the
lights
in
silence
and
climbed
the
stairs
in
the
darkness
his
father
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
were
always
fond
of
ocky
so
was
i
once
poor
fellow
i
tried
to
be
were
just
said
peter
had
to
be
just
but
it
is
justice
that
he
needing
now
it
it
his
father
voice
became
grave
a
little
stern
perhaps
years
he
had
the
kindness
he
was
dragging
us
all
down
he
lied
to
me
so
often
well
humph
ca
be
helped
do
what
you
can
good
night
as
peter
entered
his
bedroom
something
fluttered
he
struck
a
match
it
was
a
sheet
of
paper
written
on
in
a
round
girlish
hand
and
pinned
against
the
it
read
home
peterkins
all
the
time
i
been
thinking
of
you
i
missed
you
most
awfully
i
wanted
to
sit
up
but
they
would
let
me
with
love
and
ten
thousand
kisses

his
heart
reproached
him
little
kitten
kay
in
the
last
week
he
thought
much
of
her
and
once
once
she
had
been
his
entire
world
he
had
promised
her
once
that
he
was
never
going
to
marry
and
now
there
was
cherry
it
was
cherry
he
thought
of
as
his
eyes
were
closing
cherry
and
her
saying
that
there
are
those
who
allow
and
those
who
love
chapter
xxxiii
the
world
and
ocky
whenever
peter
thought
of
the
misses
jacobite
the
picture
that
formed
was
of
four
women
who
spoke
in
whispers
and
sat
forever
in
a
room
with
the
blinds
down
they
seemed
to
have
no
passions
no
desires
no
grip
on
reality
no
sense
of
life
supreme
earnestness
they
were
waiting
always
waiting
for
something
to
return
something
which
had
once
been
theirs
youth
the
hope
of
motherhood
love
the
admiration
of
men
the
day
of
their
opportunity
had
gone
by
them
they
could
not
forget
it
was
odd
to
remember
that
these
gentlewomen
prematurely
aged
had
once
been
and
courted
the
belles
of
topbury
one
of
them
sang
day
in
day
out
of
the
rest
to
be
found
on
the
other
side
of
jordan
it
was
all
that
she
had
to
hope
for
now
directly
the
front
door
opened
you
could
hear
her
the
sound
of
her
singing
sent
shivers
down
your
back
it
made
you
think
of
a
mourner
sitting
beside
the
dead
only
the
dead
was
not
in
the
house
it
had
never
come
to
birth
it
was
something
once
expected
that
no
one
dared
speak
about
when
peter
called
next
morning
he
was
aware
of
a
changed
atmosphere
the
sense
of
folded
hands
had
vanished
the
singing
was
no
longer
heard
instead
there
came
to
his
ears
a
number
of
busy
orderly
sounds
doors
softly
opening
and
shutting
feet
making
discreet
haste
upon
the
stairs
the
clink
of
dishes
in
the
basement
and
the
sizzling
of
cooking
as
he
had
passed
through
the
hall
with
its
varnished
to
the
in
which
he
waited
the
portrait
of
old
jacobite
had
gazed
fiercely
down
quite
evidently
the
old
gentleman
disapproved
of
the
use
being
made
of
his
peter
did
seat
himself
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
do
so
without
causing
havoc
every
chair
had
its
antimacassar
spread
at
its
correct
angle
he
stood
by
the
window
looking
out
into
the
cool
little
garden
a
green
shy
sanctuary
for
birds
across
which
the
july
sunlight
fell
overhead
was
the
room
in
which
uncle
waffles
had
slept
he
hoped
he
had
behaved
himself
the
chandelier
shook
several
people
were
very
industrious
up
there
and
peter
wondered
old
jacobite
had
he
always
disapproved
of
men
where
his
daughters
were
concerned
had
he
kept
them
from
marriage
had
the
tall
and
reserved
miss
florence
ever
been
kissed
by
a
man
in
the
light
of
his
own
romantic
experience
he
pitied
all
people
who
had
been
kissed
and
married
life
was
wasted
if
that
had
happened
it
was
meant
for
that
the
handle
turned
it
was
miss
effie
the
little
and
talkative
miss
jacobite
who
entered
she
was
smiling
and
lifted
to
peter
a
face
all
thanking
him
with
her
eyes
as
though
he
had
given
her
a
present
is
he
peter
asked
ought
to
have
brought
him
here
at
all
let
alone
at
such
an
hour
only
you
see
you
see
there
was
nowhere
else
to
bring
she
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
patting
out
her
dress
she
spoke
with
an
air
of
concern
was
very
well
we
made
him
stay
in
bed
we
going
to
keep
him
there
he
needs
she
was
flustered
her
hands
kept
clasping
and
unclasping
she
seemed
afraid
of
being
accused
of
immodesty
she
raised
her
eyes
shyly
so
nice
to
have
a
man
in
the
house
not
since
poor
dear
father
i
wonder
what
he
have
peter
did
wonder
he
thought
it
was
high
time
that
he
made
matters
clearer
course
i
not
going
to
leave
him
on
your
hands
i
only
brought
him
for
a
night
because
she
interrupted
anxiously
please
until
he
better
he
so
run
down
they
made
him
work
so
hard
in
in
so
he
had
brought
his
derelict
uncle
to
the
one
spot
on
earth
where
he
was
regarded
as
a
treasure
he
was
so
amazed
at
miss
effie
attitude
that
he
doubted
whether
she
was
in
full
possession
of
the
facts
but
he
faltered
miss
florence
tell
you
where
he
come
from
where
it
was
that
he
had
to
work
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
all
done
it
seemed
she
could
get
no
further
she
sank
her
head
gazing
straight
before
her
tracing
out
the
great
red
roses
in
the
carpet
peter
thought
of
her
sister
leah
the
he
knew
what
she
meant
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
with
an
effort
all
done
wrong
i
think
to
have
done
wrong
makes
one
more
gentle
it
makes
one
willing
not
to
miss
florence
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
on
them
ready
to
see
you
she
hated
scenes
because
she
saw
that
one
was
in
preparation
she
made
her
voice
and
manner
perfunctory
better
go
alone
better
go
on
tiptoe
i
would
stop
too
long
he
got
a
bad
peter
could
help
smiling
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
yet
it
was
a
tender
sort
of
smiling
did
these
innocent
ladies
know
that
too
much
whisky
invariably
left
a
bad
head
or
with
their
divine
faculty
for
forgetting
were
they
willing
to
forget
the
whisky
and
only
to
remember
to
cure
the
bad
head
it
was
a
white
room
a
woman
room
most
emphatically
the
pictures
on
the
walls
were
triumphs
of
sentimentality
gallants
were
kissing
their
ladies
hands
and
clutching
them
to
their
breasts
in
an
agony
of
parting
or
looking
meltingly
at
a
flower
which
they
had
left
the
seats
of
the
chairs
wore
linen
covers
to
prevent
their
upholstery
from
getting
shabby
the
window
was
wide
on
the
sill
crumbs
had
been
scattered
sparrows
chattered
and
grown
bold
from
habit
flew
in
on
to
the
carpet
and
preened
their
feathers
on
the
bed
the
sheets
drawn
close
up
under
his
chin
lay
uncle
waffles
he
had
the
look
that
invalids
sometimes
have
of
being
made
to
appear
more
ill
by
too
much
attention
he
had
not
shaved
his
cheeks
were
grizzled
that
help
to
make
him
look
worse
the
atmosphere
of
a
sickroom
was
completed
by
a
table
placed
beside
the
counterpane
on
which
lay
an
open
bible
and
some
freshly
plucked
peter
had
never
seen
his
uncle
in
bed
for
the
moment
he
was
embarrassed
he
drew
up
a
chair
are
you
getting
rested
uncle
waffles
hitched
himself
higher
on
the
pillow
reached
out
and
took
peter
hand
a
glint
of
the
old
love
of
crept
into
his
eyes
not
been
treated
like
this
since
my
mother
not
since
i
was
married
they
pretending
i
ill
because
they
want
to
nurse
me
carried
off
my
trousers
they
did
to
prevent
me
from
getting
dressed
what
the
matter
with
them
do
they
know
who
i
am
why
are
they
doing
it
they
suffered
ocky
tightened
his
grip
on
peter
hand
of
them
been
to
to
where
i
been
you
mean
which
one
peter
shook
his
head
all
been
to
prison
in
a
sense
not
the
kind
you
speak
of
they
had
a
big
tragedy
when
everything
looked
happy
since
then
well
since
then
people
have
pitied
and
cut
them
they
been
left
they
glad
you
come
partly
because
life
been
cruel
to
you
and
partly
look
here
i
do
want
you
to
laugh
partly
because
you
a
ocky
pulled
the
late
jacobite
tighter
across
his
shoulders
it
was
much
too
large
for
him
as
voluminous
as
a
surplice
much
of
a
man
he
muttered
much
of
a
man
arrived
here
you
know
how
before
that
had
been
hanging
about
street
corners
watched
by
the
police
and
jostled
into
the
gutter
my
own
wife
wo
look
at
me
and
yet
you
tell
me
these
strangers
his
voice
shook
do
understand
ca
see
why
peter
spoke
after
an
interval
you
have
often
been
surprised
by
too
much
kindness
have
you
comes
almost
like
a
blow
at
first
it
kind
of
hurts
but
it
the
right
kind
of
hurting
it
makes
me
want
to
be
good
never
thought
i
want
to
be
did
you
think
for
a
moment
a
fierce
look
came
into
his
eyes
does
an
animal
think
of
when
it
trapped
it
thinks
of
all
the
ways
in
which
it
can
get
back
at
the
people
who
put
it
there
but
now
he
picked
up
the
and
smelt
them
brought
them
this
morning
the
littlest
one
with
the
gray
hair
and
tiny
hands
they
were
all
wet
with
dew
when
she
brought
them
you
need
to
go
to
prison
peter
to
know
what
flowers
can
mean
to
a
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
miss
madge
entered
bringing
some
when
she
had
gone
ocky
said
take
it
in
peter
remembered
how
going
always
into
separate
rooms
with
them
taken
turns
in
owning
himself
and
kay
when
they
were
children
how
rarely
life
had
allowed
them
to
love
anything
uncle
waffles
thoughts
seemed
to
have
been
following
the
same
track
he
paused
with
the
cup
to
his
mouth
women
ought
to
have
been
in
prison
most
of
their
lives
you
said
but
i
know
marriage
can
be
a
worse
he
turned
to
peter
remember
at
sandport
how
she
never
let
me
kiss
her
it
was
like
that
from
the
first
she
kept
me
hungry
i
stole
to
make
her
love
me
she
was
always
talking
about
her
first
husband
and
making
me
jealous
and
yet
he
stopped
and
gazed
vacantly
across
the
room
to
where
sparrows
fluttered
on
the
sill
and
sunlight
fell
peter
supposed
that
he
had
forgotten
what
he
was
going
to
have
said
suddenly
his
face
became
all
purpose
and
pleading
he
flung
back
the
bedclothes
and
leant
out
gripping
peter
shoulders
till
they
hurt
steal
again
to
get
one
day
of
her
bought
affection
my
god
how
i
longed
for
her
make
her
come
to
me
you
must
peter
you
shall
do
tell
her
who
i
am
oh
do
refuse
the
sharp
agony
and
desperate
determination
of
a
man
so
drifting
and
careless
took
peter
aback
he
recalled
those
days
when
he
had
hidden
him
in
the
stable
it
had
been
the
same
then
he
had
always
been
urging
that
should
be
persuaded
to
walk
in
the
garden
that
he
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
the
one
strong
loyalty
of
his
weak
existence
had
been
the
love
of
this
woman
her
to
come
to
you
peter
said
how
she
would
she
ocky
burried
his
face
in
the
pillow
how
thin
he
was
and
listless
how
spent
how
what
was
the
word
how
smashed
it
was
as
though
in
the
human
quarry
some
chance
stone
of
calamity
had
fallen
on
him
making
him
a
moral
cripple
he
was
what
he
was
through
the
sort
of
accident
that
might
happen
to
any
man
to
the
faun
man
if
eve
refused
to
love
him
even
to
peter
himself
the
boy
pulled
the
clothes
back
over
the
man
i
do
know
how
somehow
i
do
it
i
after
that
whenever
peter
entered
the
white
room
he
saw
how
his
uncle
watched
for
someone
to
follow
the
misses
jacobite
had
found
a
doctor
who
supported
their
opinion
that
their
guest
must
be
kept
in
bed
the
prison
fare
and
long
confinement
had
broken
down
his
constitution
the
doctor
did
know
what
had
done
it
he
advised
food
and
rest
from
time
to
time
peter
brought
visitors
to
the
room
overlooking
the
garden
his
father
came
and
was
shocked
by
the
wasted
look
of
the
man
who
in
earlier
years
had
been
his
friend
it
was
of
those
earlier
years
that
they
chose
to
speak
by
an
instinctive
courtesy
they
at
least
had
been
happy
territory
they
recalled
together
their
schoolday
pranks
the
canings
they
had
earned
the
football
matches
they
had
lost
or
won
the
holidays
when
they
had
broken
boundaries
going
on
some
secret
adventure
but
when
barrington
rose
to
go
ocky
said
come
again
billy
you
used
to
hate
to
hear
me
call
you
billy
dislike
it
just
as
much
when
i
better
we
both
been
forgetting
what
i
am
and
what
i
done
if
you
come
again
we
may
remember
for
years
i
worried
you
well
that
ended
but
you
a
man
of
the
world
and
you
understand
i
a
and
i
do
want
to
spoil
the
memory
of
this
hour
old
it
turned
out
that
grace
had
slept
on
his
box
so
soundly
that
evening
of
peter
return
at
least
not
so
soundly
as
to
keep
his
eyes
shut
swank
on
my
part
peter
he
said

years

peter
brought
about
the
one
afternoon
cat
meat
halted
before
the
house
and
grace
climbed
down
from
his
box
a
bag
of
apples
in
one
hand
and
his
whip
in
the
other
he
was
very
red
in
the
face
and
embarrassed
he
had
anything
but
a
appearance
though
he
often
drove
in
funeral
processions
he
was
immensely
careful
about
the
wiping
of
his
feet
peter
tried
to
coax
him
to
leave
his
whip
in
the
hall
he
would
he
seemed
to
think
that
it
lent
him
dignity
and
explained
his
status
in
the
world
so
it
was
clutching
a
bag
of
apples
and
clasping
his
whip
against
his
chest
that
he
entered
the
white
room
where
the
birds
hopped
in
and
out
ocky
waffles
shifting
his
position
on
the
bed
caught
sight
of
the
alcoholic
figure
before
he
could
say
a
word
in
a
thick
husky
voice
grace
offered
his
apologies
i
you
ai
he
swung
the
bag
of
apples
on
to
the
bed
from
a
gal
off
a
he
paused
awkwardly
was
good
of
you
said
ocky
and
sit
grace
scratched
his
head

because
i

that
i
dunno
whether

said
ocky
grace
sat
down
it
was
most
curious
all
this
he
had
got
his
bearings
this
chap
lying
in
a
decent
bed
and
waited
on
hand
and
foot
by
ladies
was
waffles
if
you
please
but
he
had
been
an
old
cock
who
climbed
walls
to
avoid
policemen
and
rode
about
at
night
in
philanthropic
cabs
he
turned
to
him
gruffly
one
o
them
there
apples
bought
from
a
gal
off
a
did
tell
yer
that
it
was
a
sign
that
the
truce
was
established
grace
became
a
frequent
caller
an
odd
friendship
grew
up
between
these
two
men
both
broken
on
the
wheel
of
feminine
perversity
they
exchanged
notes
on
their
experiences
ocky
spoke
to
the
old
cabby
with
greater
freedom
than
to
anyone
save
peter
jehane
had
always
said
of
him
that
he
found
it
easy
to
be
sociable
with
underlings
and
ostlers
in
this
case
he
found
it
easy
because
of
the
wide
charity
of
the
underling
personal
laxity
sometimes
miss
effie
would
steal
in
and
read
to
them
of
a
man
who
chose
his
companions
from
among
publicans
and
sinners
grace
would
pay
her
the
closest
attention
and
ask
her
to
repeat
certain
passages
he
was
picking
up
pointers
with
which
to
challenge
his
daughter
confident
assertions
concerning
god
unvarying
severity
and
then
jehane
she
came
one
afternoon
to
topbury
to
visit
nan
she
had
heard
nothing
nothing
was
told
her
peter
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
get
her
to
himself
in
the
garden
after
dinner
the
others
contrived
to
leave
them
together
up
to
oxford
peter
oh
well
it
good
to
have
opportunities
and
a
father
with
money
my
poor
eustace
he
never
have
that
i
might
while
you
there
she
paused
the
thought
had
just
occurred
to
her
a
new
plan
for
marrying
off
her
girls
might
let
glory
and
riska
visit
my
father
and
mother
while
you
there
it
would
be
pleasant
for
all
of
you
would
you
like
that
said
peter
she
eyed
him
suspecting
the
sincerity
of
his
enthusiasm
course
if
you
do
want
your
cousins
do
he
assured
her
going
to
calvary
college
that
just
opposite
professor
usk
house
i
be
able
to
see
plenty
of
then
knowing
how
she
liked
to
be
appealed
to
as
a
person
with
superior
knowledge
wish
you
tell
me
some
of
the
things
i
must
do
oxford
etiquette
so
full
of
she
laughed
the
hard
lines
softened
about
her
mouth
talking
about
oxford
made
her
think
of
her
girlhood
when
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
don
was
to
be
something
akin
to
an
aristocrat
those
days
were
sufficiently
far
removed
for
her
to
have
forgotten
their
dread
of
spinsterhood
and
for
her
to
remember
only
their
glamour
must
never
use
tongs
to
your
sugar
she
said
freshers
do
that
you
must
help
yourself
with
your
fingers
and
let
me
see
you
must
never
wear
your
cap
and
gown
unless
it
positively
necessary
you
must
speak
to
a
second
or
man
unless
he
speaks
to
you
oh
there
are
so
many
at
oxford
it
would
take
all
and
then
your
mother
ever
tell
you
the
story
of
how
we
first
met
billy
it
had
been
raining
and
we
were
waiting
to
go
on
the
river
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
to
see
if
the
storm
was
over
and
there
was
your
father
looking
up
at
me
i
used
to
tease
your
mother
by
pretending
that
i
was
in
love
with
him
i
should
wonder
i
expect
she
still
believes
i
wanted
him
you
see
nan
and
i
were
inseparable
as
girls
we
used
to
be
horribly
scared
of
not
marrying
we
did
know
as
much
about
marriage
then
we
used
to
think
that
girls
were
born
on
a
raft
and
that
only
a
man
could
come
to
their
rescue
funny
idea
it
if
the
man
did
come
if
the
man
did
come
we
believed
girls
missed
everything
believed
they
got
blown
out
to
sea
out
of
sight
of
land
and
starved
with
thirst
that
was
what
made
your
mother
so
jealous
when
i
pretended
to
be
in
love
with
billy
she
was
afraid
she
lose
her
one
and
only
chance
of
getting
safe
ashore
to
the
land
of
that
was
jehane
public
version
of
how
love
had
miscarried
between
herself
and
barrington
so
she
ran
on
remembering
and
remembering
as
they
walked
the
garden
path
from
the
mulberry
to
the
pear
trees
forth
and
back
back
and
forth
while
the
sunset
reddened
the
creepers
on
the
walls
and
the
from
which
ocky
had
watched
in
vain
for
her
coming
looked
down
on
them
emptily
when
it
was
time
for
her
to
be
getting
on
her
way
peter
volunteered
to
accompany
her
to
the
station
they
chose
the
lowbury
station
instead
of
the
topbury
because
it
would
take
longer
and
they
could
continue
their
conversation
about
oxford
her
promised
land
of
the
past
must
have
had
good
times
as
a
good
times
had
she
she
painted
for
him
the
joys
of
eights
week
the
excitement
of
the
toggers
the
tremendous
elations
of
a
young
and
vivid
world
she
painted
them
for
him
as
romantic
realities
which
she
had
lived
to
the
full
and
lost
and
the
odd
thing
was
that
she
believed
that
she
had
been
happy
then
all
her
life
it
had
been
that
she
had
been
happy
her
eldorados
had
always
been
behind
her
never
in
the
or
the
when
she
pitied
herself
her
otherwise
barren
nature
blossomed
into
a
tragic
luxuriance
that
was
almost
noble
and
entirely
picturesque
she
had
noticed
where
peter
was
leading
her
she
found
herself
in
a
broad
and
quiet
street
through
which
little
traffic
passed
the
pavements
on
either
side
of
it
were
lined
with
houses
stood
far
back
from
the
road
in
gardens
with
stone
steps
climbing
up
to
them
she
slipped
her
hand
into
peter
arm
now
that
nan
was
there
to
be
pleased
by
it
she
was
willing
to
let
him
know
that
she
was
proud
of
him
in
the
silver
twilight
when
one
sees
with
the
imagination
rather
than
with
the
eyes
she
found
his
face
like
to
one
which
had
looked
up
at
her
suddenly
and
held
her
in
the
gray
blur
of
an
oxford
street
this
the
right
way
peter
is
it
a
are
you
taking
me
out
of
my
way
to
lengthen
our
talk
he
laughed
rather
excitedly
she
thought
like
to
hear
you
telling
of
the
old
days
hulloa
why
here
the
misses
jacobite
house
you
remember
what
you
said
about
women
being
on
a
raft
i
think
that
explains
them
no
one
came
out
from
the
land
to
take
them
off
step
inside
and
cheer
them
peter
my
train
there
are
plenty
of
trains
we
need
stop
more
than
a
rascal
she
gave
his
arm
a
little
hug
believe
you
had
this
in
mind
from
the
i
when
they
were
safe
inside
the
hall
and
the
door
had
closed
behind
them
his
manner
altered
she
was
conscious
of
it
in
a
second
he
no
longer
laughed
and
he
was
more
excited
someone
here
who
wants
to
meet
you
he
informed
her
who
why
did
you
tell
me
wanted
to
give
you
a
she
looked
annoyed
and
yet
curious
must
tell
me
is
it
a
man
or
a
woman
he
did
dare
to
let
her
know
that
it
was
her
husband
see
she
was
beginning
to
protest
miss
florence
entered
under
her
attempt
at
cordiality
her
face
betrayed
dismay
and
something
still
less
comfortable
judgment
peter
employed
her
entrance
as
an
excuse
for
his
own
rapid
exit
he
soon
returned
want
to
see
you
making
the
best
of
an
awkward
situation
jehane
exclaimed
so
there
are
several
of
them
it
was
only
at
she
followed
him
up
the
stairs
trying
to
catch
up
with
and
question
him
he
was
careful
to
keep
sufficiently
far
ahead
to
prevent
conversation
he
opened
a
door
on
the
landing
the
door
which
led
into
the
white
room
he
made
as
if
he
were
going
to
accompany
her
but
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
stepped
back
and
closed
the
door
the
man
held
out
his
arms
when
she
stood
rigid
and
did
not
stir
he
dragged
himself
across
the
bed
as
if
to
come
to
her
her
voice
was
sudden
like
a
whip
cracked
his
arms
fell
to
his
side
after
all
these
years
of
absence
her
stronger
will
lashed
down
his
desire
he
began
ramblingly
hinting
at
what
he
meant
not
having
the
audacity
to
finish
his
sentences
had
to
i
made
peter
promise
when
they
let
me
out
i
was
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
in
there
for
four
years
i
was
thinking
of
jehane
i
been
punished
enough
is
it
possible
that
jehane
i
love
you
i
always
have
i
always
he
was
aching
to
touch
her
through
the
mist
of
twilight
that
drifted
through
the
room
he
fed
his
eyes
on
every
detail
of
this
woman
who
had
once
been
familiar
to
him
she
had
changed
much
it
was
he
who
was
altered
she
also
made
her
sternly
pitiful
estimate
the
shrunken
body
the
purposeless
mouth
the
hair
growing
thin
and
gray
about
the
temples
he
stretched
out
his
arms
love
she
shuddered
it
was
as
though
a
man
from
the
grave
had
called
to
her
me
her
voice
was
so
low
that
his
ears
were
strained
to
catch
what
she
said
you
never
loved
me
you
were
strong
enough
for
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
we
never
belonged
to
each
other
if
you
had
loved
me
you
would
have
but
we
wo
talk
about
it
i
not
bitter
but
we
must
go
our
own
ways
he
was
lying
across
the
edge
of
the
bed
threatening
to
reach
across
the
gulf
that
spread
between
them
the
nearer
he
came
the
more
she
saw
what
had
happened
he
was
old
a
senile
caricature
of
the
man
she
had
married
in
the
her
fear
of
his
claim
on
her
made
him
ghastly
he
was
moving
he
was
getting
out
of
bed
she
opened
the
door
running
as
she
would
have
run
from
a
skeleton
he
was
following
her
down
the
stairs
she
fancied
that
he
touched
her
it
seemed
that
he
leapt
through
the
air
something
fell
in
the
hall
people
tried
to
stay
her
she
was
in
the
street
where
the
rustled
how
she
managed
to
get
there
she
could
not
tell
she
ran
on
fearing
that
he
still
followed
she
halted
for
want
of
breath
where
was
she
lighted
trams
were
passing
she
jumped
on
the
first
giving
no
thought
to
its
direction
not
until
she
was
safe
aboard
and
moving
did
she
dare
to
look
back
nothing
was
there
nothing
gaunt
and
hungry
only
saunterers
and
girls
with
their
lovers
drifting
dreamlike
through
the
shadows
under
lamps
against
whose
glare
moths
hurled
their
fragile
bodies
beating
their
lives
out
flutteringly
chapter
xxxiv
the
benevolent
delilahs
despite
the
misses
jacobite
efforts
to
keep
him
ill
ocky
insisted
on
getting
better
his
nature
refused
to
be
submerged
by
adversity
it
was
warranted
at
first
after
repeated
and
urgent
requests
he
was
allowed
to
sit
by
the
window
in
a
then
he
was
allowed
to
get
partly
dressed
and
to
ramble
about
the
house
in
at
last
he
was
permitted
to
venture
into
the
garden
there
for
some
days
his
adventures
ended
his
four
benevolent
delilahs
had
the
felicity
of
watching
their
pottering
in
the
sunshine
watering
the
grass
and
tying
up
the
flowers
while
leaves
tapped
against
the
walls
and
birds
flew
over
him
they
were
terribly
afraid
that
presently
he
would
contemplate
an
exodus
it
was
so
very
long
since
they
had
had
anything
to
do
with
men
they
had
almost
forgotten
what
things
amused
them
in
those
days
when
the
world
was
young
and
lovers
were
frequent
they
had
played
and
sung
a
little
but
the
was
faded
their
songs
were
out
of
date
the
piano
was
out
of
tune
and
their
voices
perhaps
those
lovers
had
never
really
cared
for
their
singing
appearing
to
care
had
afforded
an
excuse
for
sitting
close
to
the
singers
as
they
turned
the
pages
of
their
music
waffles
must
be
allowed
to
get
dull
that
would
be
fatal
they
asked
him
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
cats
to
see
that
they
did
pounce
on
any
of
the
birds
who
made
a
home
in
their
garden
waffles
promised
but
the
cats
still
stole
along
the
wall
and
crept
through
the
bushes
unmolested
by
the
weary
gentleman
in
something
had
to
be
done
the
case
grew
desperate
the
four
gray
sisters
hunted
through
their
father
library
and
searched
out
books
novels
in
issued
in
parts
at
a
time
when
a
new
character
from
boz
was
more
exciting
than
a
new
comet
hurled
through
the
night
from
the
unseen
shores
of
eternity
dickens
left
waffles
cold
his
tastes
were
not
literary
he
fell
asleep
with
beside
his
chair
while
the
sunlight
played
with
the
shadows
across
the
lawn
he
had
to
be
amused
providence
sent
a
diversion
seated
beneath
the
apple
tree
where
the
shrubbery
began
miss
florence
was
assuring
her
samson
for
the
hundredth
time
of
how
glad
she
and
her
sisters
were
to
have
him
with
them
to
enforce
the
sincerity
of
her
words
she
had
stretched
out
her
hand
to
touch
him
had
almost
touched
him
when
a
shocked
voice
exclaimed
the
devil
what
the
devil
poor
father
oh
dear
oh
dear
miss
florence
jumped
back
from
waffles
had
he
accused
her
she
saw
that
his
lips
were
not
moving
that
in
fact
he
was
as
surprised
as
herself
both
looked
slowly
round
their
astonished
glances
found
nothing
more
perturbing
than
the
innocent
greenness
of
the
garden
and
the
noiseless
hopping
of
birds
the
voice
came
again
maliciously
strident
dear
oh
dear
what
the
devil
what
the
devil
overhead
perched
on
a
branch
was
a
gray
and
scarlet
parrot
from
whom
had
it
escaped
how
long
had
it
been
there
all
they
knew
was
that
while
taking
refuge
in
their
garden
it
was
not
above
reviling
them
at
night
it
formed
the
habit
of
roosting
in
the
apple
tree
before
anyone
was
out
of
bed
it
could
be
heard
profaning
the
early
morning
the
energies
of
the
entire
household
were
now
directed
toward
the
effecting
of
its
capture
ingenious
plans
were
concocted
a
topic
of
conversation
was
never
lacking
the
four
elderly
ladies
placed
themselves
under
their
protection
what
would
the
neighbors
think
if
they
were
to
hear
a
constant
stream
of
blasphemy
issuing
from
their
walls
and
besides
the
parrot
in
a
cage
could
be
taught
better
manners
and
made
an
attractive
pet
grace
on
a
visit
learnt
of
the
situation
and
volunteered
to
lend
a
hand
he
and
waffles
were
provided
with
bags
of
grain
and
they
were
instructed
to
creep
with
the
stealth
of
poachers
behind
ambuscades
of
trees
and
flowers
following
the
gray
and
scarlet
peril
till
it
settled
and
then
but
the
triumphant
moment
was
continually
postponed
for
whenever
they
approached
the
parrot
no
matter
how
warily
it
spread
its
wings
mocking
them
and
crying
the
devil
or
something
even
worse
ocky
days
were
fully
occupied
now
he
had
a
interest
the
misses
jacobite
urged
on
him
the
importance
of
his
task
the
safeguarding
of
their
reputation
but
even
a
trust
so
sacred
and
incessant
failed
to
content
waffles
peter
made
this
discovery
when
his
uncle
asked
him
for
the
loan
of
a
shilling
contributions
thankfully
borrowed
was
motto
no
one
ever
gave
him
anything
it
was
always
lent
now
money
implied
an
excursion
into
the
larger
world
peter
wondered
what
might
be
its
purpose
he
knew
next
morning
his
uncle
had
a
sixpenny
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
a
tin
of
cheap
tobacco
in
his
pocket
he
was
stoking
up
to
renew
life
battle
with
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
ocky
waffles
was
a
man
he
led
peter
down
the
garden
to
the
shrubbery
behind
which
were
two
the
shrubbery
was
convenient
for
hiding
the
fact
that
he
was
smoking
he
said
jerking
his
head
across
his
shoulder
been
noticing
they
ca
afford
it
i
got
to
go
to
work
old
he
spoke
with
his
old
swaggering
confidence
as
though
the
entire
world
was
waiting
to
engage
his
services
the
which
had
been
jacobite
chafed
one
against
the
other
thoughtfully
to
go
to
work
he
repeated
reflectively
in
a
tone
which
implied
regret
think
i
know
a
fellow
we
were
in
the
coop
together
and
he
said
but
i
not
going
to
tell
you
till
i
more
certain
of
my
had
he
been
burdened
with
the
weightiest
of
financial
secrets
he
could
not
have
made
them
more
mysterious
peter
tried
not
to
smile
he
was
glad
this
was
the
muddling
uncle
he
remembered
ocky
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
waiting
for
the
bowl
to
cool
before
he
filled
it
had
an
idea
that
they
had
so
little
come
home
to
me
gradually
the
worn
carpets
and
old
things
everywhere
and
here
have
i
been
eating
my
head
off
we
have
to
pay
back
peter
have
to
pay
peter
had
reason
to
be
sceptical
about
the
paying
back
he
applauded
the
intention
except
in
imagination
his
uncle
had
never
been
much
of
a
he
had
always
been
unemployable
he
was
ten
times
more
unemployable
now
with
a
prison
record
peter
spoke
to
his
father
with
the
result
that
a
position
was
offered
as
packer
in
a
establishment
ocky
refused
it
something
the
was
at
last
divulged
one
afternoon
peter
found
his
uncle
up
the
trying
to
balance
a
box
in
its
branches
in
the
box
was
scattered
the
kind
of
food
best
calculated
to
tempt
the
appetite
of
a
parrot
the
box
had
a
leading
into
it
propped
open
by
a
stick
from
which
a
string
dangled
if
an
bird
were
to
enter
the
box
and
a
lady
beneath
the
tree
were
to
pull
on
the
string
thus
dragging
away
the
stick
the
door
would
shut
and
the
bird
would
be
a
captive
gathered
under
the
tree
were
the
four
misses
jacobite
looking
very
weepy
and
calling
up
warnings
to
their
guest
please
not
to
fall
and
to
be
careful
peter
knew
what
it
meant
these
were
the
last
offices
of
gratitude
which
preceded
departure
when
the
adventurous
gentleman
had
clambered
down
it
was
seen
that
he
wore
his
shabby
spats
and
that
his
mustaches
were
pointed
with
wax
he
led
peter
aside
and
winked
at
him
solemnly
it
was
the
return
from
elba
after
exile
he
was
going
forth
to
conquer
the
world
afresh
said
peter
said
ocky
asked
peter
said
ocky
then
after
a
silence
which
heightened
the
suspense
came
the
revelation
a
fellow
i
know
a
widow
we
were
in
the
coop
together
a
nice
fellow
he
ought
to
have
been
there
seems
he
was
in
the
business
and
dressed
like
a
parson
to
inspire
confidence
well
his
wife
was
a
gadabout
woman
and
always
jeering
at
him
one
day
quite
quietly
in
a
necessary
sort
of
manner
without
losing
his
temper
so
he
told
me
he
up
and
clumped
her
over
the
head
he
went
out
to
a
sale
never
thinking
he
done
any
more
than
was
his
duty
when
he
came
back
she
was
dead
he
a
nice
kind
sort
of
chap
is
jimmie
widow
and
religious
not
a
bit
like
a
murderer
if
you
did
start
with
a
prejudice
you
like
him
peter
i
met
him
a
fortnight
ago
he
opened
a
little
place
in
soho
and
wants
me
to
join
him
i
to
mind
shop
while
he
out
there
heaps
of
money
to
be
made
in
the
business
you
see
i
surprise
you
all
and
die
a
rich
man
yes
said
peter
i
hope
grace
thought
it
just
as
well
that
his
friend
should
enter
on
his
new
adventure
with
the
appearance
of
prosperity
he
offered
him
a
free
ride
in
his
cab
so
ocky
took
leave
of
his
benevolent
delilahs
not
as
a
pedestrian
but
as
he
had
arrived
a
shortly
after
his
exit
the
parrot
was
pounced
on
and
eaten
by
a
cat
with
the
first
money
that
he
earned
ocky
made
up
for
the
loss
with
the
gift
of
a
pair
of
the
misses
jacobite
named
one
ocky
and
the
other
waffles
which
was
the
and
which
the
lady
was
a
matter
in
continual
dispute
between
the
sisters
miss
florence
insisted
that
waffles
was
the
husband
because
it
had
the
more
considerate
habits
the
other
she
thought
of
as
jehane
and
disliked
the
question
was
still
undecided
when
a
hawker
of
goldfish
happened
to
call
no
were
required
but
the
conversation
veered
round
to
the
sex
of
the
peddler
confessed
that
in
his
spare
moments
did
a
bit
in
poultry
and
bulldogs
he
was
at
once
invited
to
enter
with
all
the
deference
that
is
due
to
an
expert
having
inspected
ocky
and
waffles
he
announced
as
his
verdict
that
them
bloomin
wuz
either
both
cocks
or
both
but
whether
cocks
or
even
he
with
a
vast
experience
him
could
not
tell
when
he
had
departed
a
silver
was
missed
from
the
sideboard
and
there
the
perplexing
problem
rested
chapter

winged

and

a
summer
afternoon
in
london
the
majesty
of
the
embankment
basking
in
sunlight
the
flowing
of
the
thames
beneath
its
many
bridges
smoke
bidding
a
casual
to

sauntering
off
a
truant
into
the
quiet
blue
trees
bravely
green
and
a
steamer
swerving
in
to
the
landing
at
westminster
his
decision
came
suddenly
she
had
asked
him
to
visit
her
perhaps
perhaps
she
could
tell
him
what
had
happened
to
cherry
he
jumped
off
the
bus
crossed
the
road
at
a
run
sprang
down
the
steps
and
thrust
his
money
through
the
hole
in
the
return
to
the
man
in
the
box
was
ostentatiously
slow
in
counting
out
the
change
these
young
bloods
made
him
bitter
with
all
the
years
before
them
they
were
always
late
and
always
in
a
hurry
he
sold
them
their
passports
to
cool
green
places
he
himself
was
left
permanently
behind
by
that
streak
of
gleaming
river
o

he
grumbled
that
your

having
at
last
handed
over
the
change
and
a
ticket
skip
lively
or

peter
skipped
lively
to
the
man
disappointment
he
scrambled
aboard
just
as
the
steamer
was
casting
loose
she
shot
out
into
the
current
panting
and
splashing
kicking
up
a
merry
white
wake
the
houses
of
parliament
grew
tall
and
at
last
spectral
in
the
distance
the
dome
of

lay
a
black
bubble
swollen
to
bursting
on
the
lip
of
the
horizon
the
smoke
of
london
trembled
like
a
thin
flag
waving
back
the
encroaching
sky
the
groan
of
creeping
traffic
was
stilled
of
labor
sank
and
sank
shorn
of
their
height
and
supremacy
this
was
the
road
to
arcady
the
flowing
road
to
the
land
of
birds
and
grass
pavements
they
were
on
the
outskirts
of
that
land
already
everybody
felt
it
a
minstrel
drew
his
harp
between
his
knees
and
fumbled
at
the
strings
he
assured
his
public
tunefully
that
he
had
dreamt
that
he
dwelt
in
marble
halls
it
was
difficult
to
believe
him
he
did
look
a
soulful
fellow
nevertheless
in
his
decrepit
person
he
echoed
the
hopes
of
incredible
romance
the
crowd
grew
careless
of
appearances
and
jaunty

cuddled
their
girls
more
closely

with

seemed

it
was

on
either
side
that
traveled
the
harpist
having
tried
his
nose
at
romance
came
back
to
reality
perhaps
it
was
because
he
sang
so
much
through
it
that

he
gave
exact
utterance
to
peter
emotions
not
that
he
had
any
home
for
cherry
to
share
he
was
likely
to
have
for
a
long
time
to
come
he
had
to
go
to
oxford
first
there
to
be
drilled
for
his
tussle
with
the
world
and
yet
unreasonably
too
previously
against
all
laws
of
caution
and
common
sense
he
wanted
to
hear
her
say
that
she
cared
for
him
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
the
contrary
he
had
written
to
her
and
had
received
only
a
line
in
answer
forget
for
your
sake
it
would
be
after
that
his
many
letters
had
been
returned
to
him
unopened
indicating
that
the
address
was
unknown
he
had
tried
to
get
into
touch
with
the
faun
man
and
harry
but
they
were
on
the
continent
roving
then
he
had
thought
of
the
golden
woman
she
had
been
kind
to
him
she
had
asked
him
to
visit
her
she
and
cherry
were
scarcely
friends
but
she
might
tell
him
where
he
could
find
her
the
words
rang
in
his
ears
they
tormented
him
they
made
him
both
sad
and
angry
they
seemed
to
treat
all
love
as
a
flirtation
as
a
stroll
beneath
the
stars
which
must
end
he
did
want
an
ending
could
conceive
that
it
was
possible
was
she
heartless
or
or
had
she
mistaken
him
was
it
that
she
did
understand
finality
or
that
she
did
understand
and
was
frightened
or
and
this
was
the
doubt
that
haunted
him
most
that
she
did
really
like

then
kew
green
and

peter
landed
the
crowd
melted
breaking
up
into
couples
who
wandered
off
purposeless
and
happy
they
had
only
escaped
from
london
that
they
might
be
alone
together
should
they
go
to
the
botanical
gardens
oh
yes

it
did
matter
anywhere
so
long
as
they
could
sit
together
and
hold
hands
he
crossed
the
bridge
stopped
a
stranger
and
asked
a
question
turned
along
the
bank
and
came
to
a
house
little
more
than
a
cottage
a
nest
tucked
away
amid
shrubs
and
trees
with
the
river
in
view
like
the
frill
on
a
woman
dress
a
green
verandah
ran
round
it
everything
was
cool
and
neat
and
hushed
the
bushes
were
trim
and
orderly

had
been
smoothly
raked
not
a
stone
was
awry
flowers
stood
sweetly
demure
in
rows
like
awaiting
a
good
conduct
prize
and
trying
to
forget
that
they
had
ever
been
hoydens
on
the
lawn
an
automatic
sprinkler
was
at
work
revolving
slowly
and
throwing
up
a
cloud
of
spray
as
he
approached
the
porch
misty
with
wistaria
and
he
searched
the
windows
for
signs
of
life
they
were
so
clear
that
they
seemed
to
be
without
panes
giving
direct
entrance
to
the
pleasant
rooms
inside
they
seemed
to
say
have
nothing
to
hide
brasses
shone
as
brightly
as
a
more
precious
metal
the
door
lent
a
virginal
touch
of
whiteness
he
rang
the
bell
and
heard
a
faint
tinkle
then
the
rustling
of
skirts
accompanied
by
prim
footsteps
a
severely
attired
maid
admitted
him
he
gazed
round
the
room
into
which
he
was
shown
books
artistically
bound
lay
on
the
table
everything
gave
evidence
of
fastidiousness
and
taste
of
a
certain
remoteness
from
the
everyday
jostle
of
life
above
an
inlaid
desk
stood
a
portrait
silverframed
out
of
curiosity
peter
tiptoed
over
the
faun
man
gazed
out
at
him
with
laughing
eyes
lying
open
on
the
desk
was
a
volume
small
and
bound
like
a
bible
a
passage
was
underscored
which
read
must
be
lord
and
master
of
thine
own
actions
and
not
a
slave
or
turning
to
the
he
found
that
it
was
imitation
of
a
voice
behind
him
said
so
you
discovered
me
he
drew
himself
up
afraid
she
might
suspect
him
of
spying
i
was
interested
by
the
words
you
underlined
i
wanted
to
see
who
wrote
them
i
ought
to
have
she
laughed
softly
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
was
all
in
white
lazy
splendid
and
vital
do
apologize
you
were
surprised
i
do
blame
she
nodded
her
head
like
a
knowing
child
yes
peter
the
golden
woman
reads
books
like
that
she
took
his
hands
in
hers
and
drew
him
over
to
a
sofa
making
him
sit
down
beside
her
now
what
have
you
come
to
tell
me
he
recovered
from
his
confusion
and
surrendered
as
all
men
did
to
her
graciousness
it
ripping
to
see
you
but
but
how
did
you
know
i
called
you
the
golden
woman
he
tells
me
she
leant
back
her
long
fine
throat
pillowing
her
head
against
the
cushions
must
never
trust
him
with
any
of
your
secrets
if
you
do
want
me
to
now
what
is
it
that
you
come
to
tell
me
you
know
he
hesitated
the
confession
to
him
was
sacred
there
was
amusement
in
her
eyes
you
know
about
me
and
cherry
he
was
sure
she
did
she
had
greeted
him
as
though
his
visit
had
been
long
expected
she
placed
her
cool
fingers
about
his
wrist
and
bent
her
head
nearer
her
voice
was
low
and
caressing
the
voice
of
one
who
breaks
bad
news
gently
know
you
told
her
that
you
loved
why
did
you
come
to
me
sooner
she
was
looking
sorry
for
him
sooner
he
questioned
she
gone
it
was
almost
as
though
she
had
told
him
that
cherry
had
died
where
to
do
know
lorie
did
say
he
took
her
perhaps
to
the
convent
poor
little
girl
you
you
frightened
her
he
was
all
amazement
what
a
contrast
there
was
between
these
two
the
boy
so
inexperienced
and
crestfallen
the
golden
woman
so
wise
and
quiet
peter
you
so
natural
and
uncivilized
you
were
too
sudden
with
her
you
told
her
that
you
loved
her
just
as
a
child
would
directly
you
felt
it
you
wanted
to
kiss
her
without
waste
of
time
you
galloped
too
fast
peter
you
tried
to
take
all
the
fences
at
one
her
voice
grew
more
tender
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
looking
away
from
him
straight
before
her
you
the
sort
of
lover
we
older
women
dream
of
when
the
hour
gone
by
the
men
who
come
to
us
are
too
cautious
they
watch
for
the
lines
in
our
faces
they
learnt
to
play
safe
but
you
with
your
glorious
youth
and
she
did
recognize
it
did
know
what
you
were
the
blue
eyes
came
back
slowly
to
his
face
she
ended
so
she
gone
peter
felt
unhappy
and
yet
comforted
she
had
envied
him
something
of
which
he
had
been
ashamed
the
unavoidable
indiscretion
of
his
lack
of
age
she
had
called
it
glorious
she
had
thought
it
foolish
what
must
i
do
will
she
will
she
come
back
again
will
she
understand
one
day
the
way
you
do
she
answered
evasively
day
we
women
all
understand
one
he
repeated
his
question
what
must
i
do
she
put
her
arm
about
his
shoulder
it
all
that
either
of
us
can
why
did
she
include
herself
the
room
was
very
silent
in
its
patient
preparedness
it
must
have
spent
years
in
waiting
the
garden
outside
seemed
to
listen
tiptoe
the
door
was
white
as
if
little
used
the
sunlight
on
the
lawn
crept
slowly
everything
watched
yet
nothing
was
wideawake
for
whom
were
they
all
expectant
there
is
one
who
allows
and
one
who
was
that
the
explanation
above
the
open
volume
of
cloistered
consolation
with
its
disillusioned
counsels
of
timid
patience
the
faun
man
smiled
from
his
silver
frame
peter
had
always
thought
so
after
all
was
it
the
faun
man
who
had
delayed
and
cherry
loved
him
had
that
anything
to
do
with
it
he
crushed
the
suspicion
down
and
yet
it
survived
you
do
know
you
could
tell
me
where
to
write
the
golden
woman
shook
her
head
can
say
you
do
know
much
about
love
peter
it
a
continual
hoping
for
something
which
never
happens
or
which
when
it
happens
is
something
different
people
say
it
a
state
of
heart
it
really
a
state
of
mind
i
think
and
hate
me
for
saying
it
i
think
true
love
is
always
on
one
side
and
is
always
disappointed
did
you
ever
hear
about
the
green
tree
and
the
bird
in
the
morn
you
did
bird
in
the
morn
to
a
green
tree
was
calling
over
come
over
night
vanished
day
born
and
i
weary
i
want
you
green
tree
for
my
lover
through
clouds
i
am
falling
i
lonely
here
only
and
heard
your
leaves
mutter
night
vanished
day
born
so
run
out
and
fold
me
green
tree
in
the
morn
bird
in
the
morn
heard
a
distant
tree
sighing
i
can
not
come
over
night
vanished
day
born
i
am
rooted
but
haste
oh
sweet
bird
to
your
lover
so
freely
you
flying
sink
hither
not
thither
hark
how
my
leaves
mutter
night
vanished
love
born
the
bird
flew
ah
whither
the
tree
was
she
stroked
his
hand
true
love
she
said
always
one
who
could
but
wo
and
one
who
would
but
can
not
always
he
denied
he
spoke
confidently
remembering
his
mother
and
father
certain
you
are
she
watched
him
mockingly
you
know
of
an
exception
believe
me
peter
winged
birds
and
rooted
trees
are
by
far
the
more
she
made
him
feel
that
she
shared
his
dilemma
that
she
reckoned
herself
with
him
among
the
trees
which
are
rooted
the
bond
of
sympathy
was
established
she
whispered
and
i
peter
we
must
wait
for
our
winged
birds
to
visit
us
we
ca
go
to
them
however
we
she
sprang
up
with
a
quick
change
of
expression
in
a
flash
she
was
radiant
but
we
need
be
running
to
the
window
she
flung
it
wide
out
there
the
sun
the
river
the
grass
they
happy
what
do
they
care
it
our
hearts
that
are
unhappy
we
wo
have
any
hearts
he
crossed
the
room
to
her
with
the
freedom
of
a
sister
she
put
her
arm
about
him
leaning
so
that
her
hair
just
touched
his
face
she
seemed
to
be
excusing
her
action
only
a
boy
how
old
shall
we
say
just
fourteen
perhaps
why
little
peter
you
too
young
to
be
in
do
you
remember
the
saying
that
every
load
has
two
handles
one
by
which
it
can
be
carried
one
by
which
it
can
not
you
and
i
are
going
to
find
the
handle
by
which
it
can
be
carried
is
that
a
bargain
i
show
you
the
handle
it
not
to
take
yourself
or
anyone
too
seriously
you
making
a
face
peter
as
though
i
given
you
nasty
medicine
you
were
determined
to
be
most
awfully
wretched
over
cherry
were
you
well
you
must
wait
half
a
her
were
to
other
people
when
she
reappeared
she
was
clad
girlishly
in
a
white
dress
which
hung
above
her
ankles
at
her
breast
was
a
yellow
rose
her
golden
hair
was
wrapped
in
bands
about
her
head
there
swung
from
her
hand
a
broad
peter
thought
that
if
the
faun
man
could
see
her
now
he
would
wait
much
longer
but
it
was
contradictory
this
that
she
had
told
him
he
had
always
supposed
that
it
was
she
who
had
kept
the
faun
man
waiting
for
himself
he
was
wishing
that
she
were
cherry
before
the
mirror
over
the
empty
fireplace
she
stooped
to
adjust
her
hat
her
arms
curved
up
to
her
shining
head
the
loose
sleeves
falling
back
from
them
they
looked
like
handles
of
ivory
on
a
goblet
the
motive
of
the
attitude
was
lost
on
peter
he
only
took
in
the
general
effect
her
eyes
watching
him
from
the
glass
saw
that
he
was
thinking
how
naïve
she
was
to
have
taken
thirty
minutes
over
dressing
and
then
to
pretend
that
she
had
hurried
by
coming
down
with
her
hat
in
her
hand
she
said
you
like
me
in
this
dress
if
you
do
change
i
took
you
at
your
word
but
would
you
really
i
almost
tempted
to
put
you
to
the
would
really
she
said
do
like
he
spoke
with
boyish
downrightness
know
jolly
well
that
you
look
splendid
in
she
pretended
to
be
abashed
and
hurried
into
the
garden
singing
just
above
her
breath
like
you
in
satin
i
like
you
in
she
seemed
to
forget
the
words
and
hummed
but
as
she
came
to
the
end
of
the
air
she
crouched
her
chin
against
her
shoulder
looking
back
at
him
naughtily
love
you
and
like
you
in
oh
anything
at
they
walked
by
the
muffled
river
trees
were
reflected
so
clearly
on
its
surface
that
it
was
easy
to
mistake
illusion
for
reality
everything
was
asleep
or
listless
in
the
summer
sun
they
came
to
a
point
where
they
ferried
across
they
entered
kew
gardens
and
sauntered
into
the
palace
for
coolness
they
did
care
where
their
feet
led
them
all
the
while
they
talked
about
life
love
men
and
women
but
really
under
the
disguise
of
words
about
cherry
and
the
faun
man
in
her
company
he
had
found
a
sudden
relief
from
suspense
she
was
so
smiling
so
generous
and
at
times
so
anxious
to
be
reckless
like
a
clever
child
saying
things
of
which
the
meaning
was
he
was
elated
to
be
seen
with
her
she
was
rare
and
beautiful
toward
evening
he
turned
back
from
the
land
of
stately
trees
and
to
the
clamor
of
the
perturbed
and
narrow
city
the
river
was
a
thread
of
gold
the
sun
foundered
red
in
a
crimson
sea
of
cloud
the
thread
of
gold
broadened
as
bridges
grew
more
frequent
black
wharfs
took
the
place
of
meadows
and
sat
huddled
along
the
banks
like
homeless
beggars
but
it
was
the
majesty
not
the
meanness
of
london
that
impressed
him
his
eyes
were
on
the
horizon
where
the
tower
of
westminster
shot
up
sculptured
and
ethereal
and
still
further
beyond
where
above
herded
roofs
the
dome
of
paul
protruded
like
a
woman
breast
he
landed
at
westminster
bridge
and
ran
up
the
steps
what
a
different
world
how
many
hours
was
it
since
he
had
been
there
he
had
recovered
his
sense
of
life
magic
the
tethered
man
in
the
eyed
him
gloomily
in
a
hurry
he
thought
with
all
the
years
of
life
before
him
ugh
that
afternoon
was
the
pattern
of
many
that
followed
he
came
from
london
to
kew
simply
and
solely
that
he
might
speak
about
cherry
and
always
with
the
hope
that
he
might
gain
some
news
of
her
subtly
the
golden
woman
would
lead
the
conversation
round
to
herself
it
was
only
at
parting
that
he
would
discover
this
once
he
said
laughingly
we
spent
all
our
time
in
talking
about
you
then
he
stopped
for
he
saw
that
he
had
not
pleased
her
time
it
shall
be
all
about
cherry
he
told
himself
but
it
was
he
had
never
had
a
woman
consult
him
before
about
her
dress
and
the
styles
of
doing
her
hair
the
golden
woman
did
she
made
him
tell
her
just
what
he
preferred
when
he
met
her
she
came
to
express
a
part
of
his
personality
in
the
intimacy
which
grew
up
between
them
the
small
reserves
of
pride
and
reticence
were
broken
down
they
spoke
their
minds
aloud
getting
old
peter
she
would
say
but
this
was
only
on
the
days
when
she
looked
youngest
if
he
had
no
money
he
would
tell
her
then
she
would
either
pay
or
they
would
make
their
pleasures
inexpensive
he
regarded
her
as
a
sister
older
than
himself
shall
i
call
you
he
asked
her
you
noticed
that
i
have
no
name
for
you
she
slipped
her
arm
into
his
golden
woman
i
like
that
you
it
has
the
touch
of
gave
you
that
name
he
said
moment
i
saw
you
years
ago
at
the
happy
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
pretending
to
be
offended
ago
how
cruel
years
ago
to
you
but
to
me
not
so
long
ago
four
years
it
why
do
you
say
things
that
make
me
feel
ancient
you
beautiful
he
got
no
farther
his
tongue
stumbled
at
compliments
he
was
going
to
have
said
that
when
you
were
very
beautiful
years
did
matter
she
caught
at
his
words
you
think
i
beautiful
indeed
beautiful
as
cherry
he
avoided
answering
saying
instead
how
everyone
turns
to
look
after
she
fell
silent
only
to
return
to
the
topic
long
after
he
had
forgotten
it
they
look
after
me
and
go
away
that
is
like
having
someone
with
you
she
could
make
him
feel
very
unhappy
more
unhappy
than
anyone
he
had
ever
met
she
could
say
such
lonely
things
and
almost
as
though
he
were
to
blame
for
her
loneliness
she
could
talk
exquisitely
of
love
and
little
children
he
wondered
why
the
faun
man
had
married
her
one
afternoon
he
had
stopped
longer
than
usual
they
had
walked
through
kew
gardens
and
had
sat
in
a
teagarden
watching
the
trippers
it
had
been
one
of
their
gay
days
when
they
had
built
up
absurd
philosophies
she
had
told
him
that
all
that
any
woman
could
love
was
the
sixth
part
of
any
man
all
the
other
were
distasteful
her
idea
was
that
every
woman
should
be
allowed
to
have
six
husbands
then
by
taking
what
she
liked
out
of
each
of
them
she
would
have
one
perfect
man
they
had
dawdled
in
the
out
of
compassion
rescuing
wasps
with
teaspoons
from
drowning
in
the
jam
when
they
rose
to
go
evening
was
gathering
on
the
bridge
they
paused
gazing
down
at
the
gray
creeping
of
the
river
and
the
slow
drifting
of
the
boats
suddenly
she
reverted
from
gay
to
sad
i
were
old
peter
you
would
come
to
see
me
so
often
one
day
though
i
try
to
fight
it
off
one
day
i
shall
be
at
the
gate
in
the
wistful
twilight
she
lifted
up
her
face
i
were
to
ask
you
to
kiss
me
would
you
think
i
but
she
did
ask
him
a
strange
summer
made
up
of
waiting
visits
to
kew
and
interludes
of
work
in
those
interludes
he
studied
hard
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
his
preparation
for
oxford
the
first
question
he
always
asked
the
golden
woman
asked
her
breathlessly
was
there
any
news
of
her
the
answer
was
always
the
same
a
negative
sometimes
she
would
read
him
portions
of
letters
which
she
had
received
from
the
faun
man
there
was
never
any
mention
of
cherry
he
grew
sick
at
heart
with
waiting
the
golden
woman
alone
shared
his
secret
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
of
it
at
home
his
holiday
was
short
that
year
three
weeks
in
surrey
on
his
return
glory
came
to
stay
at
topbury
how
she
had
escaped
his
memory
he
was
a
little
surprised
by
her
quiet
beauty
his
surprise
wore
off
as
he
got
used
to
her
she
laid
so
little
emphasis
on
herself
people
were
only
aware
that
she
had
been
there
when
she
had
gone
an
atmosphere
of
kindness
was
lacking
then
they
looked
up
were
puzzled
and
remembered
yes
glory
where
she
vanished
thought
she
was
she
only
once
penetrated
into
peter
world
then
only
for
a
few
hours
a
boy
in
love
can
think
only
of
one
woman
that
once
occurred
on
a
rainy
morning
in
the
study
which
had
been
his
nursery
he
had
just
sat
down
and
had
his
nose
in
his
books
someone
touched
him
you
do
mind
do
you
if
you
busy
now
i
come
again
he
looked
up
his
head
between
his
hands
his
hair
all
ruffled
did
see
that
you
were
there
anything
you
want
me
to
do
the
sensitive
face
flushed
he
noticed
that
the
white
hands
fluttered
against
her
breast
know
about
her
voice
was
timid
it
strove
and
sank
like
a
spent
bird
told
me
so
peter
i
came
to
a
shame
he
used
to
be
our
secret
what
want
to
know
about
him
glory
she
faltered
like
a
girl
much
younger
want
you
to
take
me
to
that
afternoon
on
the
top
of
a
bus
they
set
off
to
soho
together
what
that
excursion
meant
to
her
what
thoughts
tiptoed
to
and
fro
inside
her
head
he
never
knew
he
never
guessed
how
proud
she
was
to
be
seen
alone
with
him
in
public
her
thoughts
tiptoed
for
that
reason
so
that
no
one
might
ever
guess
they
found
uncle
waffles
waxed
mustaches
and
dingy
spats
seated
in
a
dingy
shop
they
had
to
descend
a
step
to
enter
the
riot
of
dirt
distressed
glory
she
wanted
to
busy
herself
with
a
duster
until
her
stepfather
discouraged
her
telling
her
that
it
was
no
use
it
would
be
as
bad
in
fact
in
his
line
of
trade
dirt
was
a
kind
of
advertisement
just
as
they
were
sitting
down
to
tea
widow
the
murderer
joined
them
they
found
him
a
very
severe
old
gentleman
with
and
an
eye
to
other
people
imperfections
prison
seemed
to
have
strengthened
his
moral
views
once
he
referred
to
poor
wife
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
she
had
died
respectably
of
bloodpoisoning
or
cancer
before
they
left
uncle
waffles
took
peter
aside
and
borrowed
in
a
whisper
so
the
tea
was
quite
expensive
perhaps
the
ease
with
which
he
had
contrived
to
borrow
had
something
to
do
with
the
heartiness
of
his
invitation
that
they
should
drop
in
whenever
they
were
passing
that
evening
when
glory
came
to
bid
peter
she
asked
take
me
again
wo
you
he
i
do
think
he
peter
dragged
his
thoughts
away
from
his
work
you
perhaps
widow
is
tremendously
cheerful
company
of
course
i
take
his
eyes
were
going
back
to
his
books
glory
hesitated
at
the
door
saw
that
he
had
forgotten
her
and
slipped
out
there
was
a
song
about
a
rooted
tree
and
a
winged
bird
had
he
looked
up
at
that
moment
and
seen
her
expression
he
might
have
remembered
it
chapter
xxxvi
the
spreading
of
wings
he
might
have
been
setting
out
for
australia
or
to
explore
tibet
they
made
such
a
final
matter
of
his
going
the
way
in
which
he
was
waited
on
considered
and
admired
brought
to
his
remembrance
those
early
days
when
he
had
been
sent
to
miss
rufus
to
be
cured
of
his
motherkins
dearest
oxford
only
sixty
miles
a
two
journey
i
can
write
to
you
the
last
thing
at
night
and
you
can
be
reading
me
next
morning
at
nan
shook
her
head
the
spreading
of
wings
peter
the
first
flight
from
the
nest
you
come
back
of
course
but
always
more
she
foresaw
in
this
first
departure
all
the
other
departures
that
lay
ahead
the
day
was
coming
when
she
would
be
left
alone
she
pictured
herself
as
old
and
grayheaded
sitting
listening
to
phantom
footsteps
of
memories
which
passed
and
repassed
but
never
brought
the
living
presence
already
she
tasted
the
bitterness
of
the
woman
who
having
been
first
must
learn
to
be
second
in
the
affections
of
those
who
were
part
of
her
body
kay
and
peter
were
growing
up
they
would
soon
have
their
secrets
their
interests
which
she
could
not
share
they
would
marry
and
enter
her
house
as
visitors
she
pictured
all
that
the
spreading
of
wings
had
commenced
when
peter
had
been
a
little
boy
at
sandport
certain
lines
had
driven
the
tears
into
her
eyes
with
their
wistful
yearning
they
were
often
on
her
lips
now
to
come
home
once
more
when
the
dusk
is
falling
to
see
the
nursery
lighted
and
the
children
table
spread
mother
mother
the
eager
voices
calling
baby
was
so
sleepy
that
she
had
to
go
to
bed
already
the
inexorable
law
of
change
had
taken
her
babies
from
her
and
soon
there
would
come
a
day
when
the
rooms
would
be
empty
her
home
would
become
again
what
it
was
before
she
had
entered
it
merely
a
house
when
peter
laughed
at
her
tenderly
attempting
to
coax
her
into
braver
thoughts
she
clung
to
him
searching
his
face
to
discover
the
odd
little
boy
who
had
asked
such
curious
questions
for
his
sake
she
would
smile
through
her
tears
saying
just
a
silly
woman
getting
old
peter
do
think
that
i
grudge
you
anything
i
do
i
do
only
only
it
the
first
spreading
of
wings
the
struggling
out
of
the
it
was
true
truer
than
she
fancied
there
was
cherry
however
late
he
worked
in
those
last
days
however
noiseless
he
made
his
feet
upon
the
stairs
she
heard
him
creeping
from
her
room
she
would
stand
beside
his
bed
stoop
above
his
face
on
the
pillow
and
tuck
him
up
warmly
it
would
be
for
much
longer
he
was
almost
a
man
and
billy
he
tried
to
laugh
her
out
of
a
sentiment
which
he
fought
down
in
himself
manlike
he
disguised
his
feelings
he
took
so
much
interest
in
the
preparations
that
it
might
have
been
he
instead
of
peter
who
was
going
up
to
oxford
by
day
he
pretended
to
be
cheerful
but
at
night
when
she
lay
down
beside
him
after
her
excursions
to
bedroom
he
would
take
her
in
his
arms
whispering
the
old
endearments
little
nan
and
pepperminta
just
to
let
her
understand
that
whoever
went
from
her
he
would
be
left
one
october
afternoon
grace
the
herald
of
topbury
great
occasions
drew
up
against
the
pavement
boxes
were
carried
out
meat
shuffled
away
into
the
distance
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
peter
leant
from
the
window
they
were
still
there
waving
from
the
steps
he
had
begged
them
not
to
come
to
the
station
he
knew
they
would
break
down
he
turned
the
corner
his
flight
had
begun
in
earnest
while
familiar
sights
lasted
he
was
conscious
not
of
adventure
but
depression
yes
that
was
the
house
from
the
dusk
of
whose
garden
a
hand
had
stretched
out
to
grasp
him
strange
and
this
was
the
same
christmas
cab
inanimate
things
had
changed
it
was
he
who
had
altered
then
came
the
excitement
of
paddington
undergrads
with
slung
across
their
shoulders
others
who
were
spectacled
and
looked
learned
still
others
with
ties
of
contrasting
hues
and
secret
significance
a
crowd
superbly
young
and
enthusiastic
which
did
its
best
to
appear
blasé
and
then
the
rush
of
the
train
the
exalted
sense
of
opportunity
the
overwhelming
consciousness
of
manhood
and
that
first
night
of
romantic
speculation
within
the
gray
walls
of
calvary
college
bells
hanging
so
high
and
sounding
so
mellow
that
they
seemed
to
swing
from
clouds
struck
out
the
hours
his
mother
had
heard
them
those
same
bells
in
her
girlhood
by
craning
out
he
could
see
the
window
from
which
jehane
had
caught
first
sight
of
his
father
and
had
called
attention
he
was
beginning
his
journey
at
the
spot
where
his
journey
halfway
over
had
commenced
would
he
and
cherry
tell
their
children
stories
of
where
and
how
they
had
met
he
and
cherry
it
was
of
her
that
he
was
thinking
when
harry
arran
entered
and
found
him
seated
among
his
partly
opened
boxes
to
reach
you
all
summer
peter
said
harry
was
taking
stock
of
the
room
contents
say
old
boy
brought
no
end
of
furniture
you
be
quite
a
what
that
tried
to
reach
us
with
letters
did
you
we
never
got
one
of
never
knew
our
next
address
ourselves
just
went
wandering
you
know
my
brother
such
an
erratic
peter
turned
away
so
that
his
face
would
not
be
seen
and
spoke
in
an
offhand
manner
with
you
the
question
tickled
harry
he
straddled
his
legs
and
watched
his
friend
back
tilting
his
head
toward
his
shoulder
with
a
magpie
expression
of
impertinent
knowledge
with
us
no
jolly
fear
she
a
nice
kid
and
all
that
but
we
were
out
for
fact
is
i
was
trying
to
make
that
silly
ass
brother
of
mine
forget
one
woman
we
carried
knapsacks
and
went
almost
in
rags
but
what
made
you
ask
thought
she
was
the
golden
woman
said
harry
interrupted
so
you
been
seeing
he
pronounced
with
his
old
hostility
would
see
too
much
of
peter
smiled
quietly
how
unjust
harry
had
always
been
to
his
women
friends
he
was
still
the
boy
only
a
little
too
old
now
to
climb
trees
to
display
his
jealousy
did
he
think
that
he
could
protect
the
faun
man
forever
from
marrying
did
it
ever
enter
his
head
that
he
might
fall
in
love
himself
and
yet
peter
sympathized
with
harry
for
he
had
the
same
feelings
with
regard
to
kay
he
would
hate
any
man
who
tried
to
win
her
that
was
a
long
way
off
she
was
only
thirteen
at
present
his
thoughts
came
back
to
harry
if
you
were
me
you
would
see
too
much
of
her
why
not
i
been
feeling
well
rather
sorry
for
have
have
you
harry
laughed
tolerantly
for
her
pooh
people
who
begin
by
feeling
sorry
for
eve
end
by
being
sorry
for
themselves
she
always
starts
her
affairs
like
that
by
getting
people
sorry
for
her
do
you
know
what
the
matter
with
her
selfish
a
kind
of
woman
born
to
be
petted
but
of
no
use
whatever
in
the
world
she
wants
everyone
to
love
her
and
gives
nothing
in
return
she
does
play
the
game
peter
she
expects
to
have
a
man
always
toddling
after
her
but
she
wo
marry
him
because
i
know
i
suppose
it
would
disturb
her
to
have
harry
paused
waiting
for
peter
to
argue
with
him
when
his
remarks
were
met
without
challenge
he
continued
does
mean
any
harm
her
sort
never
does
but
she
a
jolly
sight
more
dangerous
than
if
she
were
immoral
she
gambles
like
an
expert
as
long
as
luck
with
her
the
moment
she
loses
she
pretends
to
be
a
little
child
who
does
understand
the
rules
so
she
wins
all
the
time
and
never
pays
back
she
kept
my
brother
feverish
for
years
loving
him
and
then
when
it
comes
to
the
point
not
knowing
whether
she
really
loves
him
gives
her
a
nice
comfortable
sense
when
anything
goes
wrong
with
her
investments
to
feel
that
he
always
in
the
background
i
sick
of
it
she
a
ship
that
always
setting
sail
for
new
lands
and
never
coming
to
anchor
lorie
too
fine
a
chap
to
be
kept
dawdling
his
life
away
by
a
vain
woman
some
day
she
wo
be
quite
so
pretty
she
dreads
that
already
it
part
of
her
shallowness
then
she
run
to
cover
if
any
have
you
do
believe
me
suppose
you
think
every
woman
wild
to
be
married
do
think
in
this
particular
peter
flattered
himself
that
he
had
had
more
experience
than
harry
harry
took
him
up
shrewdly
you
do
think
it
you
wish
you
did
you
see
if
you
live
long
enough
there
are
heaps
of
women
like
eve
with
the
greed
of
and
the
morals
of
refrigerators
and
here
something
else
for
your
protection
eve
bear
to
see
any
woman
loved
except
herself
lorie
knows
all
this
and
still
he
infatuated
plays
dante
to
her
beatrice
she
is
worth
it
she
tells
him
she
is
worth
it
that
makes
him
think
she
noble
she
she
sucks
men
souls
out
for
the
fun
of
doing
it
when
she
thirsty
and
flings
them
in
the
gutter
like
squeezed
peter
case
was
so
nearly
similar
to
the
faun
man
that
he
bear
this
conversation
it
was
as
though
harry
was
describing
and
accusing
cherry
sucks
men
souls
out
and
flings
them
in
the
gutter
like
squeezed
and
cherry
had
been
thirsty
either
she
had
pretended
that
she
had
wanted
to
do
it
cherry
he
said
you
know
where
she
is
and
anything
about
her
harry
looked
at
him
squarely
a
little
pityingly
he
sat
down
and
crossed
his
legs
we
took
her
abroad
with
us
and
dropped
her
at
the
she
i
do
know
she
got
a
queer
streak
in
her
she
an
and
then
suppose
you
know
that
she
thinks
she
in
love
with
lorie
peter
bit
his
lip
he
drew
his
knee
up
with
his
hands
clasped
about
it
know
that
and
the
faun
man
does
he
care
for
her
harry
laughed
that
score
you
do
need
to
be
jealous
he
wishes
she
was
such
a
little
donkey
he
bored
by
it
it
complicates
matters
most
frightfully
he
her
guardian
we
had
a
most
awful
job
in
shaking
her
that
why
we
left
her
at
the
convent
had
a
rotten
scene
in
paris
tears
and
hysterics
she
planned
to
make
a
third
in
our
party
we
were
on
for
it
you
can
bet
your
peter
grew
impatient
at
harry
way
of
talking
he
spoke
shortly
you
know
where
she
is
you
can
give
me
her
address
the
grin
of
the
boy
poking
fun
at
everything
accompanied
the
refusal
kid
made
us
promise
not
to
tell
you
she
has
her
own
idea
of
playing
fair
wish
eve
he
yawned
george
time
i
was
off
to
bed
i
got
to
be
up
bright
and
early
to
call
on
thing
the
left
alone
in
the
stillness
peter
did
not
stir
in
the
street
below
his
window
footsteps
echoed
at
rare
intervals
now
and
then
as
men
parted
in
the
quadrangle
laughter
burst
on
the
night
and
voices
shouted
then
again
he
heard
the
bells
high
up
and
spectral
telling
him
that
time
was
passing
he
thought
about
harry
envying
him
the
cavalier
cloak
of
indifference
behind
which
he
hid
his
sensitiveness
he
thought
about
the
faun
man
with
his
fine
faculty
for
loving
wasted
all
these
years
by
an
undecided
woman
and
he
thought
of
eve
and
how
she
had
misled
him
letting
him
believe
that
the
faun
man
had
deserted
her
why
had
she
done
it
and
then
he
thought
of
cherry
poor
little
cherry
who
was
keeping
out
of
his
way
that
she
might
play
fair
but
he
would
make
her
love
him
he
would
work
day
and
night
to
make
himself
splendid
he
was
nothing
at
present
had
nothing
to
offer
her
but
one
day
and
so
with
the
invincible
optimism
of
youth
he
pulled
himself
together
he
was
a
knight
riding
out
on
a
quest
wearing
his
lady
badge
to
bring
her
honor
had
he
cared
he
might
have
pictured
to
himself
the
other
adventurers
he
had
known
who
had
ridden
out
in
the
same
brave
belief
that
life
was
romantic
jehane
who
had
looked
from
the
window
across
the
street
and
had
beckoned
with
her
eyes
only
to
give
a
husband
to
another
woman
ocky
waffles
who
had
come
to
her
as
the
feeble
substitute
for
the
nobility
she
had
coveted
his
mother
and
father
for
whom
despite
its
kindness
life
had
proved
a
pedestrian
affair
but
on
his
first
night
in
this
city
of
dreamers
he
saw
stretching
away
below
him
wide
landscapes
of
illusion
there
was
so
much
to
do
so
much
to
experience
so
much
to
dare
the
spreading
of
wings
had
brought
him
to
a
crag
from
which
he
viewed
not
the
catastrophe
of
sunsets
but
the
riot
of
morning
boiling
up
against
and
pouring
ensaffroned
and
clamorous
across
the
world
he
saw
only
the
glory
of
its
challenge
nothing
of
its
threat
in
the
weeks
that
followed
his
belief
in
the
marvelousness
of
mere
living
was
quickened
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
marvel
were
that
for
the
first
time
he
was
lord
of
his
own
existence
like
god
he
could
create
himself
thing
the
advised
him
in
a
sneering
tone
of
voice
that
he
had
a
chance
of
a
first
in
honor
mods
thing
had
become
embittered
by
past
experience
with
other
brilliant
students
you
do
take
to
drink
and
to
yowling
like
a
cat
of
nights
you
may
do
it
barrington
but
i
expect
you
run
wild
like
the
peter
was
claimed
by
roy
hardcastle
the
captain
of
the
boats
his
breadth
and
height
and
slightness
of
hip
marked
him
as
a
potential
oarsman
every
afternoon
he
ran
down
through
the
meadows
to
the
barges
there
to
be
tubbed
and
sworn
at
by
the
coaches
he
rowed
in
the
junior
fours
as
stroke
and
won
his
race
he
was
chosen
as
stroke
for
the
toggers
after
that
his
career
as
an
athlete
was
settled
calvary
men
began
to
prophesy
a
rowing
future
for
him
he
noticed
that
men
not
of
his
own
college
paused
on
the
bank
to
watch
his
style
as
his
eight
swung
by
the
keenness
of
oxford
life
awoke
him
to
his
powers
the
contempt
in
which
slackers
were
held
spurred
him
forward
he
had
never
been
called
upon
to
test
his
personality
in
competition
with
others
the
experience
took
him
out
of
himself
but
beneath
externals
he
remained
the
same
compassionate
idealist
he
was
different
from
other
men
and
other
men
knew
it
perhaps
it
was
that
he
was
uncivilized
as
the
golden
woman
had
told
him
uncivilized
in
the
sense
of
being
unsophisticated
and
intense
perhaps
it
was
that
his
standards
were
pitched
high
and
that
he
was
chivalrous
in
his
attitude
of
cleanness
toward
himself
at
all
events
it
never
entered
his
head
that
the
sowing
of
wild
oats
was
a
legitimate
employment
men
stopped
talking
about
certain
adventures
when
he
was
present
even
thing
the
felt
it
this
subtle
atmosphere
of
robust
innocence
which
peter
carried
about
with
him
an
innocence
which
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
priggishness
of
a
sir
galahad
thing
was
rather
surprised
he
had
always
felt
virtue
in
a
man
to
be
offensive
and
had
compared
it
to
a
prim
little
maid
attired
for
a
party
refusing
to
romp
with
bolder
children
for
fear
she
should
spoil
her
dress
thing
was
a
don
of
the
old
school
a
man
not
infrequently
about
midnight
he
was
intoxicated
it
was
said
that
under
the
influence
of
wine
his
scholarship
was
ripest
he
would
recite
rolling
speeches
from
thucydides
in
the
language
of
athens
working
himself
up
into
fervor
and
tears
declaiming
in
a
voice
which
trembled
with
humanity
and
trumpeted
with
valor
but
when
after
drinking
to
excess
he
met
peter
beneath
the
stars
in
the
shadowy
quads
he
seemed
conscious
that
an
excuse
was
necessary
he
invented
a
lie
this
scholar
beneath
which
to
hide
his
shame
from
youth
it
was
reported
that
he
was
getting
ready
for
the
judgment
day
that
he
might
be
in
his
apology
to
his
maker
to
the
of
a
dear
barrington
a
very
dear
been
taking
the
sharp
edge
off
my
grief
you
have
losht
a
dear
not
so
dear
as
i
have
so
do
you
do
he
showed
drunken
concern
lest
peter
should
do
it
and
had
to
be
reassured
many
times
at
last
shaking
his
head
sceptically
he
would
permit
peter
to
pilot
him
to
his
room
the
boy
erectness
hurt
him
it
accused
him
it
caused
him
to
look
back
and
remember
another
lad
who
beyond
the
waste
of
misspent
years
had
been
not
unlike
him
one
night
made
carelessly
sentimental
by
an
extra
bottle
he
told
the
truth
always
like
this
barrington
i
was
something
like
you
only
a
little
reckless
she
said
she
wait
for
me
and
then
so
why
now
you
know
cakes
and
ale
in
the
imagination
of
young
oxford
are
usually
associated
with
licence
to
be
abstemious
is
to
be
unpopular
and
entails
persistent
ragging
peter
believed
in
the
consumption
of
cakes
and
ale
so
long
as
it
was
carried
to
the
point
of
gluttony
he
was
eager
to
taste
life
and
took
part
in
all
the
fun
that
was
going
only
always
at
the
back
of
his
mind
lay
the
thought
of
cherry
he
must
make
himself
fine
for
her
so
as
to
be
worthy
he
got
into
frequent
adventurous
scrapes
he
was
present
at
the
empire
with
harry
when
a
young
lady
whose
stockings
were
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
her
clothing
came
to
the
footlights
and
sang
a
song
each
verse
of
which
ended
with
the
question
you
risk
i
risk
it
would
you
harry
could
bear
that
she
should
go
away
unanswered
the
courtesy
of
the
was
jeopardized
moreover
she
was
pretty
and
only
the
musicians
separated
him
from
the
stage
the
theme
of
the
song
was
kissing
he
leapt
the
splashed
his
foot
on
the
of
the
piano
seized
her
hand
and
hauled
himself
up
beside
her
shouting
i
risk
she
had
intended
her
invitation
to
be
taken
so
seriously
with
becoming
modesty
she
broke
away
from
him
just
as
he
was
about
to
prove
his
assertion
that
he
risk
it
harry
followed
her
in
one
wing
and
out
the
other
to
and
fro
across
the
stage
the
theatre
rose
yelling
watching
this
amorous
game
of
of
a
sudden
the
cry
proggins
went
up
the
proctor
and
his
bulldogs
entered
harry
jumped
from
the
stage
into
his
seat
some
considerate
person
turned
out
the
lights
and
there
was
a
rush
of
undergrads
for
the
exits
peter
and
harry
burst
into
the
night
with
the
proctor
bulldogs
close
behind
them
then
came
the
long
run
the
brilliant
plan
peter
invention
that
they
should
escape
over
walls
instead
of
by
thoroughfares
the
clambering
and
climbing
the
dashes
across
gardens
and
the
final
escape
into
freedom
through
the
house
of
a
startled
old
gentleman
who
threw
his
slipper
after
them
but
not
for
luck
harry
as
a
rule
was
the
initiator
of
their
escapades
peter
championed
them
to
a
finish
gamely
the
boy
walked
through
the
world
with
a
roving
eye
seeking
always
new
lands
of
innocent
adventure
when
he
had
almost
come
to
shipwreck
on
some
wild
coast
of
whimsical
absurdity
it
was
peter
who
hurried
to
his
rescue
the
song
which
he
had
sung
in
the
of
friday
lane
had
been
a
prophecy
he
still
sang
it
in
the
austere
city
of
gray
walls
and
spires
it
was
a
pæan
of
high
spirits
and
irrepressible
youth
been
shipwrecked
off
patagonia
home
and
colonia
antipodonia
i
shot
cannibals
animals
coons
i
bought
diamonds
twenty
a
penny
there
i
been
somewhere
nowhere
anywhere
and
i
the
wise
wise
man
of
the
wide
wide
when
he
sang
it
he
and
peter
would
look
at
one
another
with
eyes
laughing
and
would
talk
of
kay
of
how
they
had
commenced
their
friendship
by
fighting
over
her
and
of
how
of
so
many
things
that
were
kind
and
golden
like
memories
of
spring
days
when
the
wind
is
blowing
little
kay
with
her
delicate
face
and
shining
hair
she
stood
a
white
flower
in
the
of
remembrance
a
to
which
their
steps
were
continually
returning
so
while
undergraduates
of
the
roy
hardcastle
type
shouted
themselves
hoarse
on
saturday
nights
at
college
making
a
rowdy
effort
to
be
men
peter
and
harry
without
effort
remained
boys
and
sat
concocting
letters
to
a
little
girl
at
topbury
they
refused
to
credit
the
evidence
of
their
eyes
that
she
was
growing
up
they
signed
their
letters
jointly
filling
them
with
ridiculous
tenderness
she
received
them
every
monday
morning
at
breakfast
and
was
made
to
feel
that
she
was
still
a
sharer
in
their
lives
because
cherry
postponed
her
coming
peter
had
to
have
some
outlet
for
his
affection
in
a
curious
way
he
made
his
little
sister
the
temporary
substitute
for
the
girl
he
loved
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
inquire
what
motives
prompted
harry
epistolary
philanthropy
jehane
did
not
at
once
fulfil
her
promise
to
send
her
girls
to
stay
with
professor
usk
on
his
return
home
for
christmas
peter
discovered
the
reason
riska
was
in
the
throes
of
her
first
romance
at
topbury
shoulders
were
shrugged
of
course
girls
of
fifteen
did
have
their
flirtations
but
it
was
only
among
the
that
they
were
openly
acknowledged
and
dignified
into
jehane
however
took
the
matter
seriously
she
explained
why
the
young
fellow
was
a
good
catch
and
four
years
riska
senior
he
was
the
son
of
a
speculative
builder
who
was
invading
southgate
with
an
army
of
villas
the
story
of
how
riska
had
effected
the
young
capture
proved
that
jehane
training
had
been
efficient
riska
had
shown
a
fine
faculty
for
seizing
her
strategic
opportunity
comment
when
he
heard
it
was
brief
and
to
the
point
to
be
spanked
if
she
grows
up
this
way
she
make
her
face
the
for
anybody
that
was
just
it
in
her
fear
lest
her
girls
should
never
marry
jehane
had
taught
riska
who
was
more
apt
a
pupil
than
glory
to
welcome
any
comer
without
fastidiousness
there
was
nothing
about
marriage
it
was
a
into
which
you
thrust
your
hand
and
grabbed
or
to
employ
her
old
parable
maidenhood
was
a
raft
from
which
girls
who
were
wise
escaped
at
the
first
opportunity
in
on
boards
and
even
by
swimming
the
great
object
was
to
reach
the
land
of
matrimony
before
the
distance
between
the
shore
and
the
raft
had
lengthened
possibly
one
might
get
wet
in
the
effort
one
be
too
nice
over
an
affair
so
desperate
it
was
anything
to
attain
a
this
was
how
riska
first
excursion
from
the
raft
occurred
she
had
been
out
riding
her
bicycle
and
a
hat
had
blown
by
her
the
hat
must
belong
to
a
head
she
espied
the
head
and
liked
it
therefore
she
chased
the
hat
having
caught
it
she
waited
for
the
owner
to
come
up
she
accepted
his
thanks
and
indulged
in
a
few
minutes
conversation
next
day
riding
along
the
same
road
at
the
same
hour
she
had
encountered
the
owner
of
the
hat
again
after
that
and
liking
had
taken
a
hand
in
bringing
them
together
soon
he
had
been
invited
to
tea
at
the
cottage
jehane
had
made
things
easy
for
him
she
had
learnt
that
his
father
was
a
ambitious
man
who
wore
and
hoped
to
die
a
baronet
governor
the
boy
had
told
her
me
to
marry
there
lay
the
rub
would
his
father
consider
riska
good
enough
the
name
of
the
young
fellow
was
bonaparte
triggers
jehane
felt
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
young
triggers
should
be
socially
impressed
she
persuaded
barrington
to
allow
riska
to
bring
her
suitor
to
topbury
before
he
came
she
issued
a
careful
warning
that
no
mention
was
to
be
made
of
ocky
waffles
closely
questioned
she
admitted
that
without
deliberately
lying
she
had
let
the
boy
suppose
that
she
was
a
widow
if
he
seriously
in
love
with
riska
you
have
to
tell
him
barrington
objected
jehane
face
clouded
my
affair
who
marry
the
daughter
of
a
convict
it
easy
for
you
to
you
mean
that
look
here
i
not
criticizing
but
you
think
that
this
look
like
deception
supposing
he
married
riska
without
knowing
he
be
bound
to
find
out
after
let
riska
tell
him
if
he
the
right
kind
of
a
chap
he
love
her
all
the
more
for
her
jehane
lost
her
temper
as
far
as
she
dared
always
been
against
me
always
of
course
if
you
ashamed
of
us
and
do
want
riska
to
bring
him
there
was
no
arguing
along
these
lines
barrington
gave
his
reluctant
consent
riska
came
bringing
with
her
bonaparte
triggers
a
flashy
youth
with
a
cockney
thinness
of
accent
the
purpose
of
his
visit
was
to
be
impressed
he
made
it
clear
from
the
start
that
he
had
come
to
impress
he
did
not
belong
to
a
world
of
culture
and
felt
as
ocky
waffles
had
felt
before
him
that
an
effort
was
being
made
to
rob
him
of
his
he
resisted
the
effort
by
smoking
innumerable
cigarettes
and
tried
to
parade
his
own
paces
by
accompanying
himself
on
the
piano
while
he
sang
ditties
of
the
latest
order
his
visit
was
not
a
success
he
was
like
his
father
villas
after
he
had
departed
nan
had
the
nervous
desire
to
fling
up
all
the
windows
and
to
go
through
the
house
with
a
duster
it
snobbishness
on
her
part
but
she
was
unaccustomed
to
see
fingers
squeezed
and
kisses
exchanged
in
public
barrington
found
her
in
the
and
slipped
his
hand
into
hers
as
i
thought
not
in
love
with
him
her
mother
trained
her
to
believe
that
the
first
man
to
come
should
be
the
first
man
accepted
and
know
nan
billy
you
notice
anything
she
pretty
and
she
sweet
because
young
but
already
she
getting
hard
and
calculating
like
jehane
afraid
for
her
she
more
passion
than
her
mother
ever
had
she
ripe
fruit
and
not
sixteen
yet
if
she
is
plucked
she
fall
to
the
it
a
horrible
thing
to
say
of
a
young
and
then
do
like
him
but
i
hope
he
marries
he
did
marry
her
peter
and
glory
were
blamed
for
that
without
telling
anyone
they
arranged
to
give
ocky
a
christmas
treat
what
form
the
treat
was
to
take
caused
many
secret
discussions
they
had
to
be
secret
all
glory
dealings
with
her
stepfather
were
secret
the
mention
of
his
name
was
forbidden
by
her
mother
about
a
theatre
peter
suggested
glory
shook
her
quiet
head
not
very
a
pantomime
glory
nodded
believe
he
like
so
once
again
she
set
out
alone
with
her
tall
cousin
on
the
top
of
a
bus
for
a
few
brief
hours
he
was
to
be
hers
entirely
in
anticipating
the
adventure
she
had
racked
her
brains
to
think
of
entertaining
subjects
to
talk
about
she
was
terribly
afraid
she
would
bore
him
she
believed
him
to
be
so
extraordinarily
clever
she
need
have
worried
he
was
a
big
boy
on
that
winter
afternoon
and
not
a
man
directly
they
were
out
of
sight
of
the
terrace
he
took
her
arm
peter
she
protested
her
face
flushing
be
a
little
silly
he
told
her
slip
on
the
snow
and
fall
i
say
glory
you
do
look
ripping
how
you
have
got
yourself
up
you
put
on
everything
except
the
parlor
at
topbury
corner
he
wanted
to
take
a
hansom
but
she
insisted
on
a
bus
really
i
prefer
it
i
a
reason
yes
but
i
would
tell
you
what
it
is
for
her
reason
was
that
she
was
afraid
to
be
left
alone
with
him
lest
she
should
grow
it
was
easier
to
talk
in
crowds
and
how
they
did
talk
her
little
prepared
speeches
her
scraps
of
nervously
gathered
information
were
all
forgotten
they
were
two
children
sailing
through
a
christmas
world
on
a
schooner
of
the
london
streets
were
white
with
snow
shops
gay
with
decorations
in
the
murky
grayness
of
the
sky
a
derelict
sun
wallowed
like
a
ship
on
fire
it
was
a
happy
day
their
eyes
were
bright
to
find
something
on
every
hand
to
laugh
about
now
it
was
a
cutler
window
merry
with
mistletoe
and
holly
all
with
gnashing
knives
and
razors
across
which
was
pasted
the
legend
the
loved
ones
at
now
it
was
an
undertaker
in
which
stood
a
placard
do
it
now
join
my
coffin
club
anyone
can
live
make
sure
of
getting
buried
a
tactful
christmas
present
give
a
year
subscription
to
a
friend
glory
grew
out
of
her
shyness
she
snuggled
her
chin
against
her
squirrel
muff
laughing
and
chatting
saying
things
which
surprised
herself
peter
kept
glancing
at
her
she
was
yes
she
was
like
kay
he
noticed
that
before
he
noticed
her
for
a
day
and
then
forgot
her
for
months
it
had
always
been
like
that
was
it
his
fault
she
was
like
a
she
had
a
knack
of
hiding
herself
they
got
off
at
wardour
street
tunneling
into
dingy
alleys
from
which
italy
watches
strangers
with
sad
brown
eyes
dreaming
of
vineyards
and
towns
glory
twitched
his
arm
here
it
a
short
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
been
here
by
yourself
she
looked
guilty
then
smiled
up
from
beneath
her
lashes
she
had
nothing
to
fear
from
peter
since
you
first
brought
me
once
a
week
at
least
but
do
tell
mother
he
got
no
one
to
love
except
widow
i
i
sorry
for
widow
certainly
was
much
to
love
the
secondhand
shop
had
a
cheerless
aspect
on
this
winter
day
the
door
stood
open
widow
held
that
it
was
tempting
to
customers
ocky
crouched
over
a
rubbing
his
hands
the
moment
glory
entered
she
hurried
toward
him
putting
her
arms
about
his
neck
his
face
lit
up
it
glory
little
glory
he
ran
his
hands
over
her
beautiful
but
you
ought
to
come
the
duchess
find
out
oh
yes
she
will
she
always
finds
out
then
there
be
a
he
caught
sight
of
peter
young
oxford
to
see
his
poor
old
uncle
i
went
to
oxford
once
humph
got
married
there
a
bad
day
work
a
bad
day
work
they
told
him
their
plans
he
wanted
to
ask
widow
permission
widow
did
approve
of
theatres
him
go
hang
peter
said
all
very
ocky
shook
his
head
thoughtfully
very
well
but
he
may
let
me
go
hang
one
fine
morning
what
then
it
was
quite
evident
that
ocky
was
losing
his
pluck
he
would
have
forgotten
his
spats
and
would
have
forgotten
to
twirl
his
mustaches
if
glory
had
been
at
hand
to
make
him
jaunty
they
popped
him
into
a
hansom
and
whirled
him
off
to
dinner
at
the
trocadero
he
sat
between
them
holding
glory
hand
and
blinking
at
the
glaring
shops
he
was
more
accustomed
to
darkness
at
the
entrance
to
the
restaurant
he
clutched
at
peter
do
belong
here
old
glory
and
i
all
through
dinner
peter
told
his
uncle
what
he
and
glory
were
going
to
do
for
him
he
peter
would
have
money
when
he
had
money
he
would
buy
a
little
house
in
the
country
ocky
should
live
there
with
glory
and
he
peter
between
the
intervals
of
making
more
money
would
run
down
and
visit
them
it
seemed
almost
true
almost
possible
in
that
brilliant
room
where
the
corks
flew
out
of
bottles
and
the
music
clashed
it
almost
seemed
that
the
world
was
generous
that
it
would
give
him
another
chance
he
gazed
from
the
eager
boy
so
keen
to
convince
him
of
happiness
to
the
of
his
stepdaughter
which
nodded
and
nodded
insisting
yes
yes
to
peter
optimism
he
asked
if
he
might
have
whisky
when
he
got
it
he
tried
to
deceive
himself
and
others
as
to
the
quantity
he
was
drinking
bless
my
soul
i
made
my
whisky
too
then
he
would
dilute
it
bless
my
soul
i
made
my
whisky
too
the
alcohol
whipped
up
his
courage
of
course
there
were
good
times
coming
peter
would
see
to
it
he
never
promised
anything
that
he
accomplish
then
again
he
caught
sight
of
the
two
young
faces
but
what
had
peter
to
do
with
glory
they
stepped
into
another
hansom
piccadilly
circus
was
a
blazing
jewel
streets
were
washed
with
liquid
gold
people
were
silver
flowers
peter
would
do
it
the
curtain
went
up
he
was
a
child
again
he
laughed
at
everything
how
long
was
it
since
he
had
laughed
he
kept
nudging
his
companions
afraid
lest
they
should
miss
the
jokes
they
were
just
the
kind
of
jokes
he
used
to
make
widow
was
his
only
audience
now
you
could
expect
a
murderer
to
be
a
humorist
if
he
were
a
humorist
he
would
be
a
murderer
he
had
laughed
rather
louder
than
usual
someone
turned
round
in
the
row
just
in
front
a
girl
he
looked
more
closely
she
was
staring
at
him
her
companion
followed
her
eyes
seemed
surprised
and
nodded
to
peter
and
glory
all
through
the
evening
the
strange
man
kept
turning
round
stealthily
the
girl
without
seeming
to
do
so
was
trying
to
prevent
him
next
day
when
glory
returned
from
topbury
to
southgate
riska
met
her
with
clenched
hands
you

begun
to
suspect

wants
to
know

that
shabby

him

done
with
riska

sent
her
a
formal
letter
breaking
off
everything
father
he
wrote
to
know
lawyer
wagstaff
your
father

first

would
believe
that
you
were
his
daughter
i
would
have

in
love
with
you
but
you
and
your
mother
lied
to
me
about
it
i
could
never
trust

after
that
the
moment
i
saw
that
man
with
your
cousin
and
glory
i
knew
the
so
ended
riska
first
attempt
to
plunge
from
the
raft
she
clambered
back
a
little
damp
but
with
her
heart
intact
glory
was
blamed
for
the
catastrophe
in
future
she
had
to
be
more
careful
in
meeting
ocky
barrington
after
a
stormy
interview
with
jehane
in
which
peter
was
accused
shook
his

the
race
ready
peter
oar
gripped
the
water
the
seven
men
behind
him
swung
out
for
a
second
he
raised
his
eyes
from
the
boat
searching
the
faces
on
the
barge
she
was
there
cherry
the
faun
man
had
promised
to
bring
her
up
to
oxford
for
the
last
great
race
of
eights
week
perhaps
she
had
refused
to
come
perhaps
the
train
was
late
perhaps
on
the
roof
of
the
barge
he
could
see
kay
with
harry
standing
beside
her
his
mother
and
father
most
manifestly
proud
of
him
were
there
glory
yes
she
was
waving
but
they
all
of
them
together
they
counted
for
so
little
because
cherry
was
absent
it
was
his
great
week
he
was
proving
himself
a
man
more
than
a
dreamer
every
night
his
eight
had
made
its
bump
people
said
that
it
was
the
who
had
done
it
he
so
wanted
her
to
see
him
he
was
going
to
stroke
calvary
to
the
head
of
the
river
it
was
the
last
night
only
christ
church
was
in
front
all
along
the
bank
to
his
right
lay
college
barges
gay
and
animated
with
girls
and
flowers
behind
still
trees
of
the
meadows
beneath
which
cattle
grazed
spires
and
domes
soared
dreamily
against
the
deep
horizon
the
others
were
working
as
one
man
behind
him
the
eight
jumped
forward
as
though
it
were
a
live
thing
how
fit
he
felt
punts
and
canoes
blocked
their
passage
ahead
sir
look
they
had
to
halt
from
the
men
shouted
encouragement
up
up
they
rang
banged
gongs
twirled
rattles
fired
pistols
it
was
deafening
maddening
other
eights
passed
them
shooting
down
to
iffley
to
the
lower
stations
some
were
crews
they
had
defeated
on
previous
evenings
then
came
christ
church
broad
shoulders
and
tanned
bodies
swinging
they
stopped
rowing
and
rattled
their
oars
in
salute
and
challenge
the
cox
glancing
at
the
rivals
leant
forward
and
spoke
to
peter
top
o
their
training
it
be
a
long
chase
catch

the
peter
nodded
and
squared
his
mouth
doggedly
the
barges
if
not
earlier
anyway
we
catch
would
she
be
there
inside
his
head
he
was
trying
to
picture
her
how
would
she
be
dressed
a
year
since
they
met
so
long
they
came
to
their
station
astern
lay
the
other
boats
trailed
out
one
behind
the
other
pointing
their
noses
upstream
for
the
start
he
turned
to
look
ahead
the
christ
church
crew
were
pulling
off
their
scarfs
hardcastle
who
was
rowing
at
seven
leant
forward
and
touched
him
god
sake
keep
it
long
and
a
deep
boom
muttering
and
ominous
the
had
sounded
someone
on
the
bank
with
a
watch
in
his
hand
commenced
counting
off
the
seconds
eased
the
eight
out
into
the
river
maneuvering
with
poles
to
get
her
prow
at
the
right
angle
so
no
time
might
be
lost
you
ready
the
counting
stopped
peter
brought
his
slide
forward
bracing
his
feet
against
the
stretcher
a
pause
still
as
death
the
last
gun
sounded
you
devils
pick
it
up
six
you
late
steady
coming
forward
up
calvary
up
the
blades
whipped
the
water
the
river
boiled
past
them
from
the
bank
came
the
clamor
of
running
feet
and
shouting
as
if
an
asylum
had
been
freed
for
a
holiday
peter
saw
nothing
only
the
red
fiend
of
a
cox
his
mouth
wide
open
screaming
shrill
oaths
of
rebuke
or
encouragement
he
had
stopped
cursing
he
was
giving
them
tens
peter
quickened
his
stroke
from
one
to
ten
over
and
over
the
counting
went
on
would
it
never
stop
he
ached
in
every
muscle
could
he
never
slack
off
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
spurted
the
boat
responded
him
up
yelled
the
cox
peter
wondered
whether
they
were
he
longed
to
turn
and
see
for
himself
then
for
all
you
worth
well
rowed
calvary
well
rowed
indeed
stick
to
left
to
itself
his
body
would
have
crumbled
his
back
felt
broken
there
was
a
buzzing
in
his
head
something
stronger
than
will
power
a
corporate
spirit
of
honor
which
the
men
behind
him
shared
kept
him
going
her
the
cox
was
counting
again
his
face
was
as
flaming
as
his
hair
with
excitement
he
was
swinging
with
the
oarsmen
as
if
the
jerking
of
his
slight
body
could
make
the
boat
travel
faster
up
calvary
half
a
ha
the
cox
was
lying
now
peter
could
feel
the
wash
of
the
eight
they
were
pursuing
they
were
creeping
up
slowly
from
the
bank
his
name
was
thundered
barrington
well
rowed
barrington
row
like
by
jingo
he
would
he
show
there
should
be
anything
left
of
him
and
cherry
everything
was
growing
dark
sometimes
the
mist
before
his
eyes
parted
he
caught
glimpses
of
the
flaring
head
of
the
cox
sometimes
he
could
see
nothing
and
heard
only
the
endless
shouting
bidding
him
row
faster
always
faster
where
were
they
had
the
race
only
just
commenced
he
seemed
to
have
been
struggling
for
hours
the
dread
grew
up
in
him
that
he
would
never
reach
the
end
he
would
collapse
he
but
still
he
went
on
women
voices
they
must
be
passing
the
barges
racing
down
the
last
of
the
course
when
his
sight
cleared
he
saw
them
steep
banks
of
faces
shining
and
nodding
and
fluttering
into
the
far
distance
christ
church
by
jove
they
must
be
nearly
on
them
he
could
feel
the
turmoil
of
the
beaten
water
they
were
rowing
christ
church
down
her
the
cox
was
counting
hysterically
peter
tried
to
pick
it
up
he
could
he
knew
it
he
was
going
to
pieces
his
stroke
was
flagging
and
then
what
was
that
peter
as
the
eight
fled
by
he
heard
it
a
girl
voice
frantically
urging
him
and
a
man
he
heard
that
too
it
peter
well
rowed
old
only
the
faun
man
would
have
called
him
old
top
she
was
there
to
see
him
his
last
strength
returned
he
pulled
himself
together
and
swung
out
the
oars
behind
him
were
getting
in
late
he
could
feel
the
boat
dragging
it
did
matter
he
take
her
to
the
head
of
the
river
if
he
were
the
only
man
left
rowing
bedlam
was
all
about
him
the
cox
bent
forward
shrieking
at
him
trying
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
racket
he
caught
what
he
said
a
foot
what
was
happening
a
jerk
the
boat
paused
and
shuddered
it
had
touched
something
then
again
it
started
forward
someone
was
telling
him
to
stop
he
would
stop
they
wanted
him
to
go
on
before
he
was
going
to
make
sure
by
his
side
he
saw
something
like
a
broken
bird
trailing
in
the
water
then
he
saw
eight
men
fallen
forward
spent
and
panting
people
were
cheering
on
the
bank
they
were
dancing
the
cox
laid
his
hands
on
his
oar
to
stay
him
he
was
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
silly
devil
leave
off
it
dawned
on
him
they
made
their
bump
gone
ahead
of
the

there
to
watch

chapter
xxxviii
a
night
of
it
the
college
and
its
guests
were
assembled
peter
and
his
eight
with
members
of
the
crews
they
had
defeated
were
seated
at
the
high
table
the
was
in
progress
scarcely
anyone
was
absolutely
sober
for
the
first
time
in
history
calvary
had
gone
up
seven
places
and
had
finished
head
of
the
river
dons
men
who
held
themselves
aloof
with
a
shyness
broke
their
rule
and
hobnobbed
with
undergraduates
the
dim
old
college
hall
with
strong
laughter
and
bass
voices
the
animal
splendor
of
youth
the
rage
of
life
as
seen
that
afternoon
on
the
river
had
lured
them
away
from
cramped
texts
and
grievous
truths
contained
in
books
had
opened
their
eyes
to
a
more
vigorous
and
primitive
conception
of
living
a
german
rhodes
scholar
seated
next
to
the
college
chaplain
was
trying
to
teach
him
that
scandalous
libel
against
all
parsons
the
ballad
of
the
parson
cow
the
chaplain
who
on
more
formal
occasions
would
have
felt
insulted
was
doing
his
eager
best
to
pick
up
the
words
and
tune
he
kept
assuring
the
german
rhodes
scholar
of
his
immense
gratitude
he
compared
the
ballad
of
the
parson
cow
to
piers
the
ploughman
and
affected
to
regard
it
as
a
literary
pearl
of
great
price
somewhere
in
the
distance
behind
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
harry
was
singing
his
latest

gazing
round
with
severity
nobody
paid

let
himself
go

influence
of

his
bald
head
perspired
profusely
do

he
kept
saying
he
was
one
of
those
pedants
who
never
minded
telling
anybody
he
had
made
a
corner
in
one
fragment
of
human
knowledge
consequently
the
things
which
he
did
mind
telling
people
would
fill
a
library
just
at
present
he
was
explaining
to
roy
hardcastle
with
a
sugar
bowl
for
a
galley
and
forks
for
oars
the
technique
of
greek
rowing
as
revealed
in
homer
hardcastle
repeatedly
broke
in
on
him
with
skittish
references
to
olympian
immoralities
he
propounded
the
theory
to
the
professor
that
the
iliad
in
its
day
had
been
no
more
than
a
bad
boy
book
of
frisky
stories
the
professor
was
sufficiently
not
himself
to
contest
the
theory
warmly
flushed
faces
eager
eyes
gusty
laughter
from
painted
canvases
on
paneled
walls
grim
founders
looked
down
on
bacchanalia
some
of
them
sourly
others
indifferently
and
yet
others
with
envy
because
since
becoming
angels
they
could
no
longer
enjoy
a
glass
of
port
the
air
was
getting
stifling
speeches
were
commencing
the
grave
old
warden
was
turning
to
peter
and
addressing
him
hardly
a
word
was
audible
above
the
cheers
hardcastle
as
captain
of
the
rowing
rose
to
reply
outside
behind
windows
the
cool
dusk
of
summer
drifted
noiselessly
creepers
rustled
against
crumbling
masonry
the
faint
sweet
smell
of
bean
fields
from
wide
hillsides
met
the
wistful
fragrance
of
imprisoned
they
wandered
together
like
ghostly
lovers
through
the
shadowy
quiet
of
the
quads
peter
wanted
to
be
out
there
wanted
to
go
to
her
for
the
first
time
in
a
year
he
had
seen
her
strange
how
little
he
had
forgotten
he
his
eyes
picturing
and
remembering
her
trick
of
carrying
her
hands
against
her
breast
the
way
her
voice
slurred
her
meek
appearance
of
gay
piety
which
the
red
defiance
of
her
mouth
and
the
challenge
of
her
eyes
denied
she
was
a
borrowing
the
attitudes
of
sophistication
yet
exquisitely
young
and
poignantly
ignorant
of
the
world
he
had
been
able
to
say
much
to
her
only
heard
you
to
which
she
shy
in
the
presence
of
his
parents
had
replied
glad
i
was
afraid
so
afraid
that
you
would
win
the
they
had
walked
up
through
the
meadows
all
of
them
together
he
with
his
mother
and
kay
on
either
side
she
between
his
father
and
the
faun
man
he
had
heard
her
tripping
footsteps
following
behind
at
the
he
had
said
see
you
and
she
no
more
than
that
he
had
not
dared
to
appoint
a
place
of
meeting
his
parents
did
know
they
would
understand
then
he
had
had
to
run
off
to
change
for
dinner
she
might
be
leaving
early
did
she
care
for
him
she
had
seemed
more
sorry
for
him
more
as
though
she
were
trying
to
be
kind
to
him
than
in
love
with
him
she
was
elusive
but
she
was
in
oxford
where
and
with
whom
all
down
the
long
hall
they
were
pushing
back
their
chairs
struggling
up
from
tables
and
tumbling
out
into
the
cool
twilight
men
were
hurrying
to
their
rooms
to
put
on
their
oldest
clothes
there
was
going
to
be
a
a
piano
struck
up
then
ceased
suddenly
a
groping
of
feet
in
the
darkness
of
a
wooden
staircase
from
one
of
the
doorways
a
jostling
shouting
crowd
emerged
the
piano
was
set
down
in
the
open
quad
a
chair
was
tossed
out
of
a
window
harry
took
his
seat
at
the
and
commenced
jingling
over
the
air
of
never
been
born
on
a
friday
yet
when
your
mother
was
at
home
several
of
the
crew
seized
peter
and
hoisted
him
on
to
the
top
of
the
piano
he
stood
there
an
unwilling
statue
on
a
burlesque
pedestal
they
joined
hands
and
danced
about
him
in
a
circle
then
came
the
old
of
his
childhood
bringing
thoughts
of
her
and
of
the
happy
cottage
been
shipwrecked
off
harry
should
have
played
that
a
new
diversion
they
took
him
by
the
arms
and
ran
him
away
others
followed
staggering
under
the
weight
of
the
piano
through
a
passage
a
red
glow
grew
up
in
a
neighboring
quad
a
had
been
kindled
it
was
high
enough
broad
enough
big
enough
was
worthy
of
the
occasion
from
windows
two
and
three
stories
up
men
leant
out
and
hurled
down
furniture
very
often
it
was
their
furniture
who
cared
the
sky
rained
desks
and
chairs
and
tables
singing
and
shouting
everywhere
an
impromptu
was
drunk
composed
of
anything
alcoholic
that
came
handy
hardcastle
barrington
he
and
hardcastle
had
to
make
speeches
to
one
another
a
rocket
soared
into
the
night
and
burst
among
the
stars
a
rocket
from
a
neighboring
college
answered
the
challenge
soon
the
sky
became
a
target
against
which
oxford
aimed
burning
arrows
a
dispute
arose
as
to
the
details
of
the
last
great
race
hardcastle
insisted
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
row
it
all
afresh
with
grave
solemnity
the
crewmen
as
though
they
were
taking
their
places
in
an
eight
were
made
to
seat
themselves
in
a
line
along
the
path
a
rival
crew
selected
from
among
the
defeated
oarsmen
of
other
colleges
was
arranged
ahead
of
them
peter
took
his
place
at
stroke
in
this
sham
rehearsal
of
an
event
accomplished
a
pistol
was
fired
with
empty
hands
the
eightsmen
went
through
all
the
motions
of
rowing
to
an
accompaniment
of
yells
of
encouragement
it
must
be
nearly
twelve
the
men
and
guests
were
departing
peter
wished
he
could
follow
them
were
being
said
with
exaggerated
fervor
as
if
long
journeys
were
in
prospect
the
last
of
them
had
seized
his
gown
and
run
the
porter
was
locking
the
gate
of
the
lodge
big
tom
boomed
the
hour
the
college
was
closed
there
would
be
no
more
knocking
in
or
out
until
and
she
might
be
gone
peter
caught
harry
by
the
arm
and
led
him
aside
she

of
harry
laughed
slyly
of
course
who

a
room
for

in
bath
place

they
strolled
across
quad
to
peter
room
harry
asked

a
mad

behind

peter
did

till
i
come
back
and
haul

harry
did
approve
of
it
but
he
was
the
boy
and
the
adventure
was
in
keeping
with
the
night
the
rope
of
sheets
was
flung
out
for
a
moment
peter
balanced
on
the
sill
then
he
slipped
down
into
the
blackness
the
rope
was
withdrawn
the
street
was
intensely
quiet
empty
of
all
sound
houses
slept
not
a
shadow
stirred
a
cool
breeze
blew
upon
his
forehead
he
had
the
world
to
himself
he
felt
immensely
young
and
exultant
he
began
to
run
stealthily
and
on
tiptoe
keeping
close
to
the
wall
there
was
never
any
telling
someone
might
come
round
a
corner
suddenly
and
take
him
unawares
as
he
passed
professor
usk
house
he
thought
for
a
moment
of
glory
in
one
of
those
prim
rooms
she
was
lying
safe
in
bed
she
and
riska
seen
riska
laughing
with
hardcastle
on
the
barge
who
the
dickens
had
introduced
her
she
was
quite
capable
of
having
introduced
herself
then
he
forgot
everything
and
everyone
but
cherry
and
the
purpose
of
his
errand
he
came
out
on
to
high
street
flowing
in
a
slow
curve
past
churches
and
ancient
doorways
as
he
went
by
all
souls
he
had
the
sense
of
still
gardens
and
cool
turf
lying
steeped
in
moonlight
he
wanted
to
laugh
wanted
to
shout
to
the
silent
city
that
he
would
soon
be
talking
with
her
he
turned
down
by
hell
passage
and
dived
under
an
archway
into
a
little
court
where
a
lamp
smoldered
in
an
iron
bracket
and
echoes
played
behind
his
footsteps
there
was
an
uncared
for
garden
in
one
corner
stood
a
public
house
with
all
the
lights
extinguished
along
one
side
hugging
the
wall
of
a
house
ran
the
narrow
path
he
stepped
back
and
looked
up
at
the
windows
that
must
be
hers
to
the
left
he
whispered
her
name
was
she
awake
he
fancied
that
he
heard
her
stir
he
picked
up
some
earth
and
threw
it
against
the
panes
he
had
startled
her
something
creaked
as
though
she
sat
up
sharply
be
frightened
it
peter
he
called
beneath
his
breath
she
was
coming
soon
she
would
look
out
he
saw
her
leaning
down
on
him
white
clad
with
her
dark
hair
falling
all
about
her
face
could
stop
away
any
longer
cherry
i
had
to
come
to
you
i
want
you
to
promise
that
you
be
here
when
i
asked
you
before
you
only
said
only
perhaps
cherry
after
a
year
of
waiting
promise
me
was
she
laughing
was
she
angry
he
was
whispering
to
her
again
locked
all
the
doors
i
was
afraid
that
i
never
get
out
i
climbed
down
when
everyone
was
in
bed
i
had
to
come
to
peter
peter
she
was
cross
with
him
she
was
laughing
so
persistent
it
took
you
to
do
silence
again
promise
he
urged
he
wished
that
he
might
see
her
clearly
they
had
called
her
cherry
because
her
lips
were
red
promise
wo
you
say
her
answer
came
so
that
he
could
scarcely
hear
it
i
promise
will
you
go
now
he
nodded
like
a
child
to
give
emphasis
yes
but
only
if
you
go
now
at
she
waited
to
see
him
start
he
turned
away
reluctantly
as
he
entered
the
shadow
of
the
archway
he
thought
she
kissed
her
hand
chapter
xxxix
on
the
river
but
had
she
had
she
kissed
her
hand
and
if
she
had
did
it
mean
anything
harry
having
hauled
him
back
into
college
had
crept
away
sleepily
thankful
that
his
watch
was
ended
peter
sat
on
by
the
open
window
imagining
and
questioning
the
wide
white
moon
rode
quietly
at
anchor
roofs
were
vague
as
an
ocean
bed
not
a
sound
nothing
stirred
but
yes
behind
stone
walls
of
a
college
garden
a
recluse
nightingale
commenced
to
warble
little
notes
at
first
as
though
a
child
threw
back
the
counterpane
of
darkness
and
muttered
to
itself
then
a
cry
a
full
clear
stream
of
song
that
fell
like
silver
showered
through
the
peter
closed
his
eyes
imprisoned
love
was
speaking
with
its
throat
outstretched
in
the
shadows
a
heart
was
pouring
forth
its
yearning
the
world
slept
was
love
always
like
that
a
bird
in
a
hidden
garden
with
none
to
listen
setting
dreams
to
music
a
sash
was
raised
it
was
across
the
street
and
further
down
the
sound
came
from
the
professor
house
it
might
be
glory
odd
if
they
two
were
keeping
watch
together
should
he
call
to
her
if
he
remembered
he
would
question
her
his
eyes
grew
dusty
he
folded
his
arms
beneath
his
head
someone
entered
morning
he
was
drenched
with
sunlight
a
voice
addressed
him
discreetly
apologetically
it
a
bit
last
night
shall
i
pour
out
your
bath
sir
it
pull
you
peter
laughed
gaily
then
a
little
shamefully
when
he
realized
what
the
scout
had
meant
having
brekker
out
my
bath
no
it
picking
up
a
towel
he
ran
down
to
the
barges
through
the
glistening
meadows
what
a
splendid
world
dazzling
and
stripping
he
dived
into
the
river
shaking
his
head
like
a
dog
as
he
rose
to
the
surface
he
drifted
down
stream
turned
fought
his
way
back
and
climbed
out
glowing
a
day
with
her
she
had
promised
he
had
to
breakfast
with
the
professor
all
his
family
were
to
be
there
and
after
that
his
father
might
have
plans
it
would
be
ages
before
he
could
be
alone
with
her
the
clocks
of
the
city
were
striking
eight
big
and
little
voices
together
could
he
manage
it
there
was
time
for
just
a
word
he
was
panting
when
he
came
to
hell
passage
and
entered
the
courtyard
her
window
was
wide
he
called
to
her
she
did
answer
he
plucked
a
rose
and
tossed
it
in
the
air
it
landed
on
her
when
she
wakened
she
might
find
it
and
guess
that
he
had
been
there
professor
usk
was
in
his
moral
mood
that
morning
great
pity
a
great
pity
that
young
oxford
drinks
to
he
was
trying
to
impress
his
wife
with
his
own
extreme
temperance
hardcastle
was
a
guest
riska
was
seated
next
to
him
beneath
the
surface
of
what
others
were
saying
they
carried
on
a
softly
spoken
conversation
private
to
themselves
riska
piquant
face
was
alive
with
interest
every
now
and
then
she
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
shaking
her
head
incredulously
stooping
her
shoulders
and
glancing
sideways
at
hardcastle
they
might
have
been
old
friends
her
color
came
and
went
when
she
found
herself
observed
behind
her
apparent
artlessness
there
lay
a
calm
and
determined
peter
took
his
place
between
kay
and
his
mother
peterkins
kay
whispered
face
is
is
a
she
squeezed
his
hand
he
was
silent
and
excited
impatient
for
the
next
two
hours
to
end
sometimes
his
thoughts
were
in
the
street
hurrying
to
a
little
courtyard
where
a
window
stood
wide
and
the
echoes
of
oxford
ran
together
sometimes
his
attention
was
caught
by
a
remark
as
when
the
professor
turned
to
his
wife
who
had
just
sat
down
and
said
agnes
while
you
up
and
she
replied
benares
i
not
his
mother
watched
him
noticing
the
gladness
in
his
eyes
she
wondered
what
it
meant
glory
lifting
her
face
to
his
gazed
at
him
furtively
from
beneath
her
lashes
they
had
gone
upstairs
to
the
room
from
which
jehane
had
looked
down
on
barrington
peter
had
said
was
a
nightingale
singing
did
any
of
you
hear
it
and
glory
was
about
to
answer
when
the
prancing
of
hoofs
drew
them
crowding
to
the
window
it
was
a
coach
setting
out
for
london
on
the
box
sat
the
faun
man
reining
in
and
steadying
the
chestnut
the
roof
was
a
garden
and
girls
faces
every
seat
was
taken
as
they
came
clattering
up
the
cobbled
street
the
horn
was
blowing
merrily
peter
took
one
glance
and
was
racing
down
the
stairs
the
watchers
at
the
window
saw
him
dash
out
sprint
hatless
to
the
corner
and
vanish
the
faun
man
pulled
up
peter
searched
for
you
all
over
college
they
said
you
gone
out
to
brekker
want
to
come
with
us
we
find
room
for
peter
was
looking
at
the
faun
man
nor
at
harry
who
sat
behind
him
he
was
looking
at
the
golden
woman
who
was
trying
to
catch
his
attention
he
was
looking
at
cherry
her
place
was
on
the
box
to
the
right
of
the
faun
man
she
returned
his
gaze
with
laughter
at
first
then
because
he
did
laugh
back
she
turned
away
her
head
and
peter
he
was
puzzled
and
hurt
why
was
she
escaping
she
had
promised
and
why
when
she
was
escaping
did
she
wear
his
rose
against
her
breast
to
london
he
said
slowly
i
ca
join
he
swung
round
and
was
walking
away
harry
called
after
him
not
going
to
london
you
chump
we
only
going
as
far
as
high
wycombe
to
look
at
a
house

aboard
and
buck
the
golden
woman
added
her
persuasion
my
sake
peter
the
house

going
to
look
at
sounds
almost
as
fine
as
the
happy
cottage
does
it
lorie
going
to
live
there
harry
thought
he
had
spotted
the
trouble
be
in
oxford
before
nightfall
catch
a
train
peter
answered
shortly
i
ca
i
got
my
people
with
he
waved
his
hand
and
stepped
from
the
road
to
the
pavement
cherry
had
said
nothing
she
let
her
clear
eyes
rest
on
him
the
horses
were
getting
restive
with
standing
and
the
passengers
impatient
the
faun
man
shook
out
his
whip
the
leaders
jumped
forward
if
you
ca
you
ca
he
said
suddenly
cherry
spoke
not
going
please
let
me
the
faun
man
whistled
that
the
way
the
wind
blowing
the
ladder
was
brought
out
peter
helped
her
to
descend
and
good
the
horn
sounded
as
the
coach
rolled
on
its
way
every
head
was
turned
looking
back
it
grew
dim
in
the
dust
of
its
journey
they
were
left
alone
in
the
sharp
sunlight
embarrassed
in
each
other
presence
it
was
she
who
spoke
first
in
a
little
caressing
voice
which
mocked
its
own
sincerity
was
nice
of
me
and
yet
i
did
intend
i
did
really
peter
not
at
first
i
thought
we
all
thought
you
be
one
of
the
party
and
then
because
i
wanted
to
go
i
forgot
all
about
you
forgive
me
you
wanted
to
go
i
she
broke
in
on
him
instead
of
making
things
better
i
made
them
worse
i
should
have
come
to
oxford
i
hurt
should
have
come
to
oxford
she
was
threatening
to
go
out
of
his
life
again
just
when
he
refound
her
he
said
willing
to
be
hurt
by
you
every
day
if
only
i
may
see
you
do
you
remember
you
understand
i
rather
be
hurt
by
you
than
loved
by
any
other
woman
in
the
know
in
silence
they
walked
back
to
the
professor
house
at
the
corner
of
the
street
before
they
came
into
view
he
asked
mind
spending
the
morning
with
my
people
they
returning
to
london
this
afternoon
then
we
can
be
by
the
faces
were
still
at
the
window
looking
out
he
was
very
conscious
of
the
curiosity
he
aroused
when
he
had
climbed
the
stairs
and
entered
the
room
he
explained
as
though
it
were
the
most
natural
of
happenings
brought
cherry
with
his
father
relieved
the
awkwardness
by
asking
are
we
going
to
do
not
the
river
hardcastle
suggested
they
set
out
in
two
punts
from
the
barges
the
professor
and
his
wife
had
excused
themselves
saying
that
they
had
to
work
hardcastle
took
charge
of
glory
and
riska
peter
of
the
rest
they
turned
up
the
cherwell
past
the
botanical
gardens
through
mesopotamia
coming
at
last
to
parsons
pleasure
the
sound
of
bathers
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
warned
them
the
ladies
got
out
while
the
men
drew
the
punts
across
the
rollers
taking
them
round
to
the
farther
landing
barrington
accompanied
nan
by
the
footpath
directly
they
were
alone
she
turned
to
him
there
anything
between
them
who
girl
and
peter
her
husband
laughed
and
held
her
arm
more
firmly
her
and
peter
what
an
idea
nan
leant
against
him
as
if
seeking
his
protection
not
that
i
dread
it
i
want
to
keep
them
with
us
kay
and
peter
always
tears
were
in
her
eyes
he
remembered
once
before
in
this
place
he
had
seen
her
like
that
you
forgotten
he
said
was
here
that
it
all
began
everything
between
us
it
was
after
we
three
had
met
a
rainy
day
with
the
sun
coming
out
i
left
you
to
take
the
punt
round
the
island
and
jehane
said
something
behind
my
back
something
that
brought
tears
it
was
when
i
saw
you
crying
pepperminta
that
i
loved
she
uttered
the
wonderfully
obvious
linking
up
his
memory
with
the
present
little
thought
of
peter
by
the
parks
the
river
was
dense
with
punts
and
canaders
girls
lay
back
on
cushions
under
sunshades
sweethearts
and
sisters
men
in
college
colors
and
flannels
shouted
to
one
another
ahead
here
and
there
a
blue
showed
up
or
a
leander
occasioning
respect
and
whispered
explanations
the
great
men
of
the
undergraduate
world
were
pointed
out
peter
was
recognized
as
the
of
calvary
he
did
notice
the
heads
that
were
turned
did
care
his
eyes
rested
on
cherry
as
often
as
they
dared
before
his
parents
she
treated
him
casually
there
were
times
when
he
spoke
to
her
and
she
paid
him
no
attention
he
was
unhappy
did
she
dislike
him
then
as
though
she
felt
that
she
was
overdoing
it
a
secret
flash
would
pass
between
them
and
his
fears
were
quieted
forget
his
father
reminded
him
leave
for
london
this
hardcastle
with
his
lighter
burden
was
pushing
on
ahead
peter
looked
at
his
watch
almost
one
now
and
i
do
like
to
he
stooped
to
whisper
to
his
father
then
straightened
up
knows
why
i
do
like
to
let
hardcastle
out
of
my
sight
not
with
riska
he
the
sort
of
man
we
have
to
follow
if
i
ca
punt
you
back
you
can
lunch
at
the
inn
at
marston
ferry
and
catch
a
tram
that
get
you
to
the
station
in
to
nan
that
day
was
like
the
repetition
of
an
old
story
once
before
how
long
ago
was
it
once
before
she
had
drifted
up
this
quiet
stream
between
gnarled
trees
and
whispering
rushes
to
the
gray
inn
where
a
crisis
in
her
life
had
threatened
she
recalled
jehane
dark
and
tragic
with
trailing
hands
she
could
see
billy
gay
and
careless
peter
was
like
him
and
kay
was
very
much
what
she
had
been
her
eyes
fell
on
cherry
she
examined
her
slightness
the
frailty
of
her
throat
her
astonishing
gray
eyes
looking
out
of
a
face
of
pallor
the
delicate
mist
of
hair
sweeping
across
the
whiteness
of
her
forehead
not
the
girl
for
peter
there
was
a
girl
good
enough
and
then
she
tried
to
believe
that
she
was
foolish
it
had
happened
to
him
yet
not
yet
and
the
parting
it
was
the
same
as
long
ago
everything
was
repeating
itself
she
and
kay
and
billy
stepped
aboard
the
ferry
at
the
last
moment
glory
said
she
would
accompany
them
the
man
pulled
on
the
rope
the
ferry
lumbered
out
into
the
stream
peter
and
the
girl
and
hardcastle
and
riska
were
waving
to
them
from
the
bank
nan
had
never
thought
that
she
could
feel
so
cruel
toward
anybody
as
she
crossed
the
meadows
she
looked
back
peter
and
the
girl
pigmy
figures
now
were
still
waving
jehane
and
billy
had
waved
to
her
like
that
standing
near
together
the
old
pang
and
then
she
looked
at
glory
walking
quietly
with
her
head
bent
never
turning
in
a
flash
little
memories
trifles
in
themselves
sprang
up
and
became
significant
each
one
pointing
in
the
same
direction
she
stole
forward
and
took
glory
hand
hardcastle
and
riska
had
vanished
their
punt
was
gone
from
the
landing
upstream
the
river
was
lost
to
view
in
a
slow
bend
no
one
was
in
sight
an
atmosphere
of
secrecy
had
settled
down
from
arbors
of
the
inn
and
tufted
places
along
the
banks
came
the
indistinct
murmur
of
voices
the
country
looked
uninhabited
stretching
away
for
miles
in
squares
and
triangles
of
meadows
each
one
different
in
coloring
from
the
next
through
the
green
panorama
of
trees
and
hedges
the
winding
of
the
river
was
traceable
by
the
flowered
freshness
that
it
left
overhead
casting
fantastic
shadows
drifted
white
unwieldy
clouds
peter
helped
her
in
arranged
the
cushions
for
her
and
pushed
off
from
the
bank
he
had
expected
to
say
so
much
to
her
now
the
silence
was
more
happy
the
day
was
running
out
the
veiled
radiance
of
a
summer
evening
crept
across
the
landscape
a
little
breeze
sprang
up
blew
through
his
hair
and
stooped
the
reeds
to
the
water
surface
she
lay
curled
up
and
contented
humming
to
herself
he
could
just
hear
her
voice
above
the
splash
of
his
pole
and
the
lapping
of
the
river
sometimes
she
would
raise
her
eyes
and
smile
down
the
distance
of
the
punt
that
separated
them
when
he
was
looking
she
gazed
more
intently
at
his
tall
flanneled
figure
noticing
his
tanned
arms
with
the
sleeves
rolled
back
and
the
upright
litheness
of
his
body
did
his
eyes
catch
hers
unexpectedly
she
veiled
them
in
inscrutable
innocence
the
waterway
was
narrowing
becoming
choked
with
weeds
and
bulrushes
mother
he
stopped
punting
and
turned
at
the
sound
of
her
high
clear
voice
mother
did
like
me
you
may
tell
her
that
she
need
be
what
did
she
mean
she
spoke
gently
without
resentment
like
you
little
cherry
no
one
could
help
yes
she
did
like
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
she
was
right
wo
you
please
stop
caring
for
me
then
we
can
be
friends
she
saw
what
i
told
you
from
the
first
that
i
not
your
sort
quite
different
he
swung
the
nose
of
the
punt
round
so
that
it
crunched
into
a
tall
green
wilderness
that
sprang
up
and
closed
behind
their
passage
he
laid
aside
the
pole
and
looked
down
the
length
of
their
refuge
regarding
her
intently
caring
for
you
he
laughed
shortly
though
i
could
the
matter
out
of
my
hands
i
never
had
a
chance
not
to
care
for
you
if
i
did
believe
that
a
day
was
coming
when
when
you
be
kinder
to
me
cherry
i
not
want
to
go
any
further
i
mean
with
living
i
not
good
at
saying
things
in
words
you
everything
to
she
avoided
his
glance
turning
her
head
away
so
that
he
watched
her
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
with
concentrated
vehemence
terrible
to
feel
like
that
people
are
sure
to
disappoint
you
no
right
to
allow
yourself
to
depend
on
someone
else
for
all
your
if
i
do
mind
if
i
willing
to
take
my
chance
she
lifted
up
her
face
appealingly
it
is
fair
to
me
peter
you
force
me
to
become
responsible
it
is
that
i
do
like
you
i
admire
you
that
is
love
you
do
know
your
own
mind
yet
there
are
heaps
and
heaps
of
better
and
then
there
lorie
i
tell
you
peter
i
not
your
sort
please
please
stop
caring
for
the
gladness
died
in
him
it
was
as
though
the
lamps
behind
his
eyes
had
guttered
out
his
voice
trembled
his
face
had
grown
lean
and
sad
say
that
cherry
it
keeps
us
separate
you
do
love
me
now
perhaps
but
one
day
you
need
me
i
waiting
till
you
need
me
and
then
you
are
my
sort
cherry
but
i
never
be
good
enough
for
you
all
the
time
i
trying
ever
since
i
known
you
i
been
trying
to
become
better
it
like
yesterday
whenever
i
losing
the
race
and
getting
slack
i
hear
you
calling
then
i
say
to
myself
have
to
be
fine
for
her
i
think
you
must
be
my
sort
cherry
if
you
can
do
that
love
was
meant
not
to
make
people
perfect
but
to
make
them
believe
always
in
the
best
if
you
do
that
for
me
cherry
she
put
her
hands
before
her
eyes
and
slipped
back
against
the
cushions
as
though
she
had
become
very
tired
he
stole
down
the
punt
noiselessly
and
knelt
beside
her
you
like
to
be
loved
cherry
she
spoke
still
with
her
eyes
covered
course
i
like
to
be
loved
every
girl
likes
to
know
that
some
man
cares
for
why
her
voice
came
wearily
it
would
be
selfish
when
i
intend
to
marry
you
but
but
i
wish
i
did
have
to
keep
away
from
he
leant
forward
and
kissed
her
cool
cheek
do
keep
away
from
must
kiss
me
peter
if
only
you
would
kiss
me
directly
alone
why
do
you
why
did
he
that
she
could
ask
such
a
question
told
him
so
much
she
was
like
a
beautiful
statue
he
could
stir
no
life
in
her
done
it
he
said
simply
since
the
world
began
you
ca
help
it
when
you
love
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
wonderingly
how
quickly
she
could
change
from
sad
to
gay
all
of
a
sudden
from
seeming
listless
and
spent
she
had
become
radiant
and
virile
her
face
was
tender
and
wore
an
amused
expression
she
stooped
toward
him
and
touched
him
a
little
boy
for
the
first
time
i
feel
older
than
you
so
much
older
what
good
times
you
and
i
could
have
if
only
we
did
think
he
slipped
his
arm
about
her
little
cherry
you
want
to
be
loved
but
you
wo
believe
that
i
your
man
you
wo
let
yourself
love
me
that
all
that
the
matter
when
i
kiss
you
you
turn
your
face
away
as
if
you
were
only
enduring
she
thrust
her
face
forward
with
sweet
demureness
i
turn
away
you
so
persistent
peter
no
he
pushed
out
from
the
rushes
the
sun
was
tumbling
into
bed
spreading
his
gold
hair
on
the
pillow
and
dragging
his
scarlet
over
him
the
river
was
dull
as
tarnished
silver
but
it
flared
crimson
where
in
its
windings
the
west
smote
it
cherry
does
it
ever
come
i
leaving
i
promised
you
you
had
i
want
as
she
shook
her
head
laughing
i
gave
you
you
ask
for
the
day
after
you
a
greedy
little
boy
never
why
must
you
go
he
asked
i
expected
lorie
thinking
of
buying
a
place
called
it
at
curious
corner
near
a
village
called
whitesheaves
he
heard
all
kinds
of
splendid
things
about
it
it
only
thirty
miles
from
oxford
so
we
meet
quite
often
she
crouched
her
face
against
her
shoulder
and
kept
him
waiting
you
do
try
to
kiss
me
she
said
and
then
seeing
that
he
was
going
to
be
melancholy
never
know
your
luck
cheer
up
at
the
barges
when
they
had
stepped
out
peter
remembered
he
turned
to
the
hardcastle
back
i
do
see
his
returned
as
i
know
of
barrington
a
lady
with
did
any
message
for
when
comes
peter
shook
his
head
it
was
growing
dusk
walking
up
through
the
meadows
cherry
let
him
take
her
hand
when
they
had
fetched
her
luggage
from
the
house
in
the
little
courtyard
and
he
had
seen
her
off
at
the
station
he
hurried
down
to
folly
bridge
and
along
the
staring
across
the
river
to
the
calvary
barge
he
could
see
someone
moving
he
called
a
punt
put
out
when
it
came
alongside
the
man
looked
up
through
the
darkness
take
you
across
sir

is
not
that
said
peter
only
wanted
to
find

man
scratched
his
head
yet
sir
reckon
he
must
left
punt
higher
up
by
magdalen
bridge

he
strolled
away
thoughtfully
chapter
xl
grace
goes
on
the
bust
grace
rose
by
stealth
dawn
had
not
yet
broken
he
groped
his
way
into
his
clothes
in
the
darkness
he
did
not
dare
to
light
the
gas
clutching
his
boots
against
his
breast
with
ridiculous
caution
for
so
fat
a
man
he
tiptoed
down
the
stairs
in
the
passage
he
listened
and
looked
up
half
expecting
to
see
a
head
in
surveying
him
from
across
the
banisters
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
that
fine
bass
sound
like
a
trombone
thrust
out
violently
to
its
full
length
was
his
the
those
notes
tremulous
and
were
his
daughter
musical
contributions
from
dreamland
all
was
well
he
had
not
roused
them
in
the
stable
he
stuffed
up
the
window
with
a
sack
and
lit
a
lamp
meat
raised
his
head
and
winked
at
him
winked
at
him
solemnly
it
was
a
solemn
occasion
they
both
felt
it
this
setting
of
a
daughter
at
defiance
while
horse
and
master
went
on
the
bust
the
preliminary
preparations
of
the
past
few
days
had
awakened
suspicion
for
one
thing
grace
had
repainted
his
cab
the
wheels
were
a
bright
mustard
and
the
body
was
a
deep
blue
the
color
which
is
usually
associated
with
oxford
for
years
too
many
to
count
meat
harness
had
done
service
tied
together
with
bits
of
rope
and
string
where
the
leather
had
worn
out
but
his
harness
was
brand
new
of
a
vivid
tan
yesterday
and
the
day
before
cat
meat
and
his
master
had
indulged
in
a
rest
that
alone
gave
material
for
conjecture
grace
and
her
had
conjectured
what
was
the
old
boy
planning
was
he
contemplating
marriage
at
his
time
o
life
they
said
scornfully
at
any
rate
they
were
snoring
now
as
he
led
cat
meat
out
he
growled
in
his
ear
a
drop
o
drink
old
hoss
till
this
here
is
and
then
he
smacked
his
lips
the
lean
tail
flirted
across
the
bony
haunches
in
assent
grace
rubbed
the
nose
of
his
friend
by
pub
till
old
pal
and
then
understand
he
had
harnessed
up
and
was
tying
the
last
of
the
blue
rosettes
to
meat
bridle
when
he
was
startled
by
a
window
flung
up
he
glanced
round
the
he
dreaded
then
father
you
just
come
up
and
tell
me
you
just
blowed
if
the
vanished
feet
were
coming
down
the
stairs
scrambling
on
to
his
box
he
jerked
at
the
reins
and
lumbered
out
into
the
cold
march
dusk
a
shrill
voice
calling
she
was
in
the
stable
coming
down
the
street
after
him
what
had
she
on
or
rather
what
had

he
muttered
a
persistent
hussy
he
cracked
his
whip
meat
broke
into
a
gallop
at
a
cabman
shelter
near
trafalgar
square
he
halted
for
breakfast
the
glory
of
his
appearance
attracted
attention

he
left
his
friends
with
a
flourish
it
was
almost
as
though
his
youth
had
returned
almost
as
though
he
had
a
red
nose
and
a
daughter
who
tried
to
convert
him
he
felt
young
and
smart
this
blowy
morning
he
did
want
to
see
a
reflection
of
himself
he
wanted
to
pretend
that
he
was
a
brisk
young
cabby
when
was
an
art
and
not
a
creeping
means
of
livelihood
were
at
the
corners

daffodils
and
violets
in
the
faces
of
the
passing
crowd
the
lord

he
signed
to
her
with
his
whip

felt
affluent
he
bought
two
bunches
and
leant
down
from
his
box
while
she
pinned

into

and
crawled
through

that
queer
chinese
puzzle
of
cramped
dwellings
all
with

that
look
like

he
pulled
up
outside
the

and
entered
with
his
whip
tied
with
blue
ribbon
held
out
before
him

to

pouring
all
in

direction
everyone

in
high

and
kept
up
a
ceaseless
stream
of
chaff
the
thud
of
hoofs
on
the

the
beat
of
a
drum

drew
up
against
the
curb
from
the
point

he
had
selected
by
standing
on
the
roof
a
glimpse
could
be
obtained
of

rattled

caught
the
contagion
of

himself
to

than
a
spectator
he
wanted
to
talk
in
a
loud
voice
to
grace
so
that

calling
on
his
men
for
a
spurt

were
creeping
up
lifting
their
boat
through
the
water
in
a
splendid
effort
men
swore
beneath
their
breath
they
tiptoed
and
clawed
at
one
another
utterly
selfish
and
careless
in
their
wild
desire
to
gain
a
clearer
view
of
those
distant
streaks
of
energy
which
bent
forward
and
swung
back
mechanically
in
that
gray
ribbon
of
beaten
water

policeman

was
in

the
dark

he
must
tell

somebody
who

a
few
drinks
at
a
few
pubs
and
arrived
at
soho
hilarious
widow
informed
him
that
ocky

not
returned
he
wandered
off
in
search
of
the
at
the
back
of
his
mind
the
belief
grew
up
that
she
would
be
sympathetic
he
found
her
tucked
her
inside
and
drove
back
to
soho
widow
did
approve
of
the
and
said
that
ocky
had
come
back
how
many
times
did
he
halt
before
the
shop
how
many
pubs
had
he
visited
what
had
become
of
little
the
she
disappeared
and
he
had
any
money
in
his
pockets
never
mind
there
was
a
hole
in
the
roof
of
his
cab
his
day
work
had
given
him
something
night
fell
stars
came
out
did
he
make
up
the
song
himself
have
he
found
himself
again
before
the
shop
still
on
the
box
of
his
cab
the
shop
was
shut
and
he
was
singing
to
empty
windows
widow
though
a
murderer
you
be
sure
a
very
nice
man
a
good
enough
pal
for
widow
came
out
sincerely
grieved
and
expostulated
grace
begged
his
pardon
profoundly
he
told
him
that
he
always
admired
his
religious
whiskers
would
hurt
his
feelings
however
many
wives
murdered
wanted
to
be
friends
he
added
in
a
whisper
that
he
had
a
daughter
who
be
all
the
better
for
a
poker
brought
down
smartly
across
her
nut
she
was
religious
too
only
she
had
got
whiskers
then
he
insisted
on
shaking
hands
and
was
at
last
allowed
to
on
condition
that
if
this
token
of
esteem
was
granted
he
would
go
away
and
never
never
more
come
back
at
least
not
till
morning
what
to
do
now
the
night
was
young
a
return
to
the
stable
was
not
to
be
contemplated
that
daughter
of
his
must
be
avoided
some
time
when
he
was
a
very
old
man
he
go
home
to
her
but
not
yet
it
was
every
man
who
owned
a
blue
and
yellow
cab
with
a
hole
in
the
roof
of
it
perhaps
it
was
eleven
perhaps
earlier
he
was
in
leicester
square
affording
himself
the
supreme
luxury
of
refusing
to
be
hired
coming
down
the
steps
of
the
empire
was
a
group
of
young
men
slim
of
hip
and
in
evening
dress
their
arms
were
linked
as
soon
as
they
appeared
cheering
began
a
crowd
gathered
round
someone
commenced
to
sing
others
took
it
up
had
a
little
heart
she
lent
it
to
a
feller
who
swallowed
it
by
and
did
dare
to
tell
she
asked
it
back
and
said
she
sue
away
the
feller
ran
whatever
will
poor
mary
do
she
lost
both
heart
and
they
all
gone
mad
pandemonium
broke
loose
grace
wondered
vaguely
what
it
meant
why
were
people
dancing
why
were
people
shouting
then
he
saw
that
the
maddest
of
the
mad
wore
a
dark
blue
badge
he
heard
someone
explain
to
a
neighbor
winning
his
brain
cleared
he
was
off
his
box
in
a
flash
struggling
panting
fighting
his
way
to
that
tall
young
chap
who
was
in
the
centre
he
was
wringing
him
by
the
hand
by
all
that
wonderful
it
grace
where
did
you
spring
from
before
the
question
was
answered
peter
was
introducing
him
to
the
faun
man
to
harry
to
hardcastle
to
a
host
of
others
grace
was
both
elated
and
abashed
a
keb
sime
old
keb
peter
got
it
for
a
cab
i
do
know
you
see
there
are
so
many
of
many
there
plenty
o
room
peter
both
inside
and
there
ai
no
charge
put
many
yer
like
on
the
roof
so
long
as
cat
meat
can
drar
yer
i
a
ole
cut
for
yer
legs
on
harry
laughed
cat
meat
ca
manage
it
we
they
piled
in
uproariously
the
suggestion
was
made
that
cat
meat
should
be
taken
out
and
that
peter
should
be
allowed
to
ride
him
grace
would
hear
of
it
o
that
young
cruelty
ter
the
keb
where
to
the
gilded
turtle
was
mentioned
for
all
that
there
were
four
on
the
roof
and
six
inside
cat
meat
never
made
an
easier
journey
that
was
due
to
the
singing
mob
of
undergraduates
who
lent
a
hand
and
grace
he
reflected
that
it
was
for
naught
that
he
had
repainted
his
growler
he
was
the
proudest
cabby
in
london
that
night
he
was
going
to
be
prouder
at
the
gilded
turtle
he
was
seated
next
to
peter
and
treated
as
an
honored
guest
he
had
a
misty
impression
that
the
waiters
were
stowed
away
beneath
tables
and
that
their
places
were
taken
by
peter
friends
he
believed
and
asserted
to
the
day
of
his
death
that
he
made
the
speech
of
the
evening
something
reminiscent
about
which
meandered
off
into
moral
reflections
about
a
person
named
and
in
general
he
distinctly
remembered
that
more
than
once
he
turned
his
pockets
inside
out
asking
plaintively
lydy
done
this
then
the
gentleman
whose
ears
moved
like
a
dog
sang
a
about
peter
they
all
joined
in
a
rousing
chorus
clinking
glasses
kissed
the
moon
dead
lips
he
googed
the
eye
of
the
sun
but
when
we
crawled
to
the
end
of
life
we
wonder
we
ever
begun
chorus
peter
was
his
name
so
peterish
was
he
he
wept
the
sun
eye
back
again
lest
he
should
never
fought
the
pirate
king
where
stars
fall
down
with
a
thud
but
we
we
even
quake
to
hear
spring
rhubarb
break
into
bud
chorus
and
peter
was
his
name
etc
sailed
the
trackless
waste
with
hair
the
of
blood
but
we
we
tramp
the
trampled
streets
with
souls
the
colour
of
mud
and
peter
was
his
name
so
peterish
was
he
he
wept
the
sun
eye
back
again
lest
he
should
never
where
was
peter
where
were
harry
and
the
faun
man
he
was
out
in
the
streets
only
the
wildest
of
the
young
bloods
remained
with
him
it
did
matter
to
this
falstaff
if
they
all
went
away
and
only
cat
meat
stayed
he
was
going
to
make
a
night
of
it
hardcastle
was
complaining
that
he
never
been
arrested
and
taken
to
vine
street
he
insisted
that
it
ought
to
happen
to
every
english
gentleman
at
least
once
they
drove
back
to
leicester
square
to
see
if
they
could
find
a
policeman
who
make
up
this
deficiency
in
their
education
they
found
three
only
they
chose
the
wrong
side
of
the
square
and
discovered
that
they
were
being
taken
to
a
less
aristocratic
station
then
they
explained
their
mistake
and
their
captors
being
as
the
faun
man
would
have
said
human
fellows
accepted
compensation
for
wasted
time
called
them
lords
and
allowed
them
to
escape
it
was
grace
who
provided
the
final
entertainment
they
had
grown
a
little
tired
of
his
constant
enquiry
as
to
lydy
done
this
being
unwilling
to
lose
their
esteem
as
a
humorist
he
drove
them
down
side
streets
to
a
shop
which
he
had
promised
no
more
to
the
house
was
in
complete
darkness
he
threw
down
the
reins
and
stood
up
his
whip
clasped
against
his
breast
his
eyes
lifted
to
the
white
moon
sailing
in
silence
over
sulky
singing
ran
in
his
family
it
was
from
him
that
grace
inherited
her
talent
what
his
voice
lacked
in
sweetness
it
made
up
in
volume
he
startled
the
stillness
lustily
mister
widow
though
a
murderer
you
be
sure
a
very
nice
man
a
good
enough
pal
for
if
widow
had
been
a

he
would
have
felt
flattered
that
the
winning
oxford
crew
should
take
the
trouble
to
greet
him
thus
musically
at
two
in
the
morning
he
was

appeared
at
a
window
the
singing
grew
more
hearty
the
head
vanished
the
street

opened
a
gentleman
very
hastily
attired
carrying
a
pair
of
white
spats
in
his
hand
shot
out
on
to
the
pavement
a
voice
from
the
darkened
shop
pursued
him

chapter
xli
stood
up
the
hill
looking
out
across
a
terraced
garden
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
lay
a
plain
where
hamlets
nestled
beneath
the
wings
of
trees
and
meadows
washed
about
the
shores
of
yellow
like
green
rivers
in
flood
in
blue
pastures
beyond
the
edge
of
the
horizon
white
clouds
wandered
like
browsing
sheep
the
windows
of
were
latticed
the
roof
was
thatched
it
was
no
more
than
a
converted
cottage
it
blinked
at
you
as
though
it
wore
spectacles
behind
it
ran
a
roman
road
buried
deep
in
the
leaves
of
centuries
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
was
a
legionaries
camp
to
show
where
the
road
ended
a
white
cross
had
been
cut
by
turning
back
the
sod
from
the
underlying
chalk
gathered
about
the
camp
in
a
spreading
back
for
miles
through
uplands
was
a
whose
leaves
fluttered
like
green
butterflies
crucified
on
boughs
of
silver
clouds
trailed
slowly
over
it
or
hung
snared
in
its
topmost
branches
over
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
immediately
behind
the
faun
man
house
lay
a
with
vivid
squares
of
turf
from
which
red
flags
waved
angrily
as
poppies
across
the
valley
shone
fields
of
mustard
like
sunlight
falling
in
sudden
patches
the
faun
man
puzzled
curious
corner
the
village
might
have
been
named
in
prophecy
of
his
advent
with
such
extraordinary
oddness
did
he
conduct
his
household
like
birds
hopping
in
and
out
of
a
hedge
his
visitors
came
and
went
without
knocking
nobody
tried
to
explain
anybody
no
one
at
thought
explanation
necessary
the
women
were
young
and
dashing
certainly
they
were
not
married
to
the
men
if
they
were
wicked
which
was
never
proved
they
were
decidedly
by
day
they
played
golf
and
rode
horseback
by
night
they
sat
in
the
terraced
garden
where
fragrances
wandered
like
old
sweet
memories
there
to
the
tinkling
of
banjos
and
mandolins
they
sang
till
dusk
had
brimmed
the
valleys
and
the
moon
sailed
solitary
when
their
laughter
had
grown
tired
a
light
would
spring
up
in
a
room
beneath
the
thatch
where
the
faun
man
worked
sometimes
it
would
outstay
the
dawn
the
villagers
watched
these
doings
from
a
distance
they
wagged
their
heads
but
if
had
the
reputation
for
being
wild
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
its
master
had
money
he
drove
a
from
oxford
to
london
he
rode
a
horse
called
satan
which
no
one
could
manage
it
had
killed
two
men
already
and
the
money
he
coined
it
with
his
pen
so
it
was
reported
but
the
inhabitants
of
curious
corner
never
guessed
the
motive
of
all
this
frivolity
that
the
faun
man
was
really
living
was
only
distracting
himself
till
a
woman
with
golden
hair
should
nod
when
life
would
commence
and
the
golden
woman
peter
saw
her
often
in
oxford
when
he
cycled
out
with
harry
to
during
his
vacations
in
london
he
believe
what
harry
told
him
that
she
was
cold
and
selfish
everything
that
she
did
was
tender
from
the
caressing
way
she
had
of
speaking
to
the
childish
frankness
with
which
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
own
when
she
was
happy
she
made
everyone
love
her
and
everyone
forgive
her
everyone
except
harry
and
cherry
she
had
studied
the
art
of
appearing
adorable
so
that
what
in
others
were
faults
in
her
took
on
the
glamour
of
attractions
she
was
so
fond
of
the
faun
man
why
she
marry
him
peter
did
know
he
gave
it
up
shrugged
his
shoulders
somewhere
underground
as
in
his
own
life
the
body
of
love
lay
buried
in
the
stillness
did
he
listen
he
could
hear
jealousy
gnawing
gnawing
like
a
rat
in
the
coffin
of
a
dead
princess
once
in
reading
one
of
the
faun
man
books
he
came
across
a
jotting
in
the
margin
the
thought
of
which
had
no
bearing
on
the
text
it
was
as
though
thwarted
longing
had
cried
aloud
suddenly
becoming
aware
of
its
own
tragedy
the
sentence
read
is
slipping
away
from
us
i
have
tried
to
make
you
love
me
and
yet
the
bond
of
sympathy
which
existed
between
himself
and
the
golden
woman
increased
in
strength
and
knowledge
he
could
talk
to
her
of
so
many
things
concerning
which
he
was
silent
to
other
people
being
in
love
he
had
to
talk
to
someone
she
was
so
wise
in
the
advice
she
gave
him
by
the
patience
with
which
she
listened
she
seemed
to
tell
him
that
she
herself
had
endured
the
same
indifference
how
that
could
be
he
did
not
understand
she
encouraged
him
to
make
confession
it
became
a
habit
perhaps
the
trust
which
he
placed
in
her
flattered
her
it
may
have
been
that
his
capacity
for
being
so
sheerly
young
tantalized
her
she
desired
above
all
things
to
be
always
young
herself
without
doubt
his
implicit
faith
in
her
goodness
helped
to
silence
her
but
she
was
not
above
using
their
friendship
as
a
means
of
provoking
the
faun
man
she
would
slip
her
arm
about
peter
neck
and
say
chance
for
you
now
her
lover
eyes
would
rest
on
her
broodingly
and
film
over
hiding
his
thoughts
well
i
have
even
though
cherry
knew
that
it
was
said
in
pretence
her
face
would
grow
radiant
it
hurt
peter
he
would
willingly
have
given
the
best
years
of
his
life
to
make
her
care
for
him
like
that
it
was
then
that
he
listened
and
heard
within
himself
the
gnawing
of
the
rat
of
jealousy
cherry
he
made
no
progress
with
her
she
seemed
to
like
him
and
she
held
him
off
she
avoided
being
left
alone
with
him
in
company
there
were
times
when
she
treated
him
with
intimacy
times
when
she
ignored
him
while
all
his
actions
told
her
plainly
that
in
his
life
she
was
the
supreme
interest
she
seemed
to
go
out
of
her
way
to
inform
him
without
words
that
in
hers
he
was
secondary
then
when
he
had
grown
tired
and
had
almost
determined
to
cure
himself
she
would
do
something
unexpected
and
considerate
which
kept
him
hoping
only
at
parting
did
she
allow
herself
to
appear
glad
of
him
she
had
the
power
of
chilling
him
with
her
graciousness
while
with
her
gray
eyes
she
allured
him
cherry
cherry
her
name
set
all
his
world
to
music
one
day
he
found
her
alone
at
she
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
which
looked
out
over
the
plain
where
the
meadows
flowed
smoothly
and
the
ripened
the
others
had
left
her
had
gone
over
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
to
play
golf
he
had
cycled
out
from
oxford
without
warning
climbing
through
the
steep
garden
busy
with
the
stir
of
birds
and
insects
he
espied
her
curled
up
like
a
kitten
among
the
cushions
her
eyes
fast
shut
and
her
breath
coming
softly
he
stooped
over
her
tempted
by
the
redness
of
her
mouth
her
eyes
opened
she
showed
no
embarrassment
made
no
attempt
to
brush
away
her
sleepiness
she
did
not
move
but
lay
there
meeting
his
gaze
quietly
he
broke
the
silence
why
do
you
always
avoid
touching
me
we
farther
apart
now
than
we
were
were
when
we
first
met
i
surprise
you
any
longer
by
telling
you
that
i
love
you
and
yet
and
yet
to
me
it
still
wonderful
why
do
you
always
treat
me
as
though
i
were
nothing
i
i
do
mean
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
i
go
away
if
i
went
away
you
might
learn
to
miss
she
turned
toward
him
gently
please
peter
do
do
you
do
want
me
you
would
miss
me
i
never
know
what
you
think
of
me
you
never
tell
me
never
betray
she
let
her
fingers
nestle
in
his
hand
only
one
peter
of
course
i
miss
you
i
do
need
to
tell
you
that
i
like
you
very
much
he
looked
away
across
the
unheeding
country
yes
but
liking
is
voices
were
heard
and
footsteps
approaching
she
sat
up
hurriedly
smoothing
out
her
dress
so
much
rather
be
friends
i
be
such
a
good
little
friend
to
you
peter
if
you
only
be
content
with
content
with
that
he
shook
his
head
i
the
faun
man
and
the
golden
woman
entered
they
were
laughing
always
treat
me
in
public
as
if
we
were
alone
together
really
lorie
i
wish
you
then
she
saw
peter
seated
close
to
cherry
her
eyes
saddened
chapter
xlii
the
to
london
i
wonder
why
he
does
come
peter
stepped
out
of
the
gazing
up
and
down
the
cobbled
street
harry
always
undisturbed
and
laughed
can
never
be
sure
of
lorie
looks
as
though
it
was
going
to
rain
he
put
it
off
because
of
he
had
said
peter
have
sent
us
for
two
hours
they
been
inventing
excuses
for
the
faun
man
he
had
told
them
to
invite
a
party
of
their
friends
and
he
drive
them
to
london
to
go
to
london
without
permission
was
against
all
rules
but
to
ask
permission
would
be
useless
since
most
of
the
men
like
peter
and
harry
were
sitting
for
their
finals
within
the
next
fortnight
that
they
were
taking
a
sporting
chance
of
discovery
lent
a
touch
of
daring
to
the
excursion
all
of
them
had
risen
early
and
had
been
ready
for
the
start
since
nine
it
was
nearly
eleven
if
the
faun
man
did
turn
up
shortly
they
would
have
time
to
cover
the
sixty
odd
miles
to
london
and
to
catch
the
last
train
back
that
last
train
back
was
very
necessary
if
they
were
in
college
or
their
lodgings
by
midnight
when
doors
were
locked
there
was
no
telling
what
would
happen
probably
they
get
sent
down
which
would
mean
that
they
miss
their
finals
and
would
either
lose
their
degrees
or
have
to
wait
a
year
before
they
were
examined
they
were
getting
fidgety
pulling
out
and
consulting
their
watches
some
of
them
were
already
saying
that
it
was
too
late
to
risk
it
a
horn
sounded
peter
glanced
back
from
the
road
into
the
lodge
and
shouted
you
fellows
here
he
round
the
corner
swung
the
chestnut
leaders
tossing
their
heads
and
jingling
their
bridles
as
the
wheelers
followed
and
the
coach
drew
into
sight
an
exclamation
went
up
he
is
they
looked
again
to
make
certain
no
he
was
instead
a
woman
sat
on
the
box
erect
and
lonely
perched
high
up
governing
the
reins
with
her
small
thin
hands
her
trim
figure
was
clad
in
a
dark
blue
suit
as
a
with
pale
blue
facings
her
hair
was
caught
back
into
a
loose
knot
against
her
neck
and
dressed
so
smoothly
that
it
shone
like
metal
the
effort
of
controlling
the
horses
had
brought
a
flush
to
her
cheeks
her
eyes
sparkled
with
mischief
at
the
sensation
she
was
creating
she
reined
in
against
the
pavement
glancing
down
provocatively
at
the
group
of
young
men
she
looked
a
goddess
and
had
the
sense
to
know
it
up
hoping
for
me
she
cried
cheerfully
that
it
peter
nodded
nearly
but
where
the
faun
man
and
cherry
why
are
you
driving
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
tell
you
later
scramble
they
scrambled
up
filling
the
roof
and
joking
all
their
high
spirits
and
anticipation
recovered
the
guard
sprang
away
from
the
leaders
heads
and
clambered
up
behind
as
the
coach
started
forward
it
was
a
gray
day
with
patches
of
blue
gleaming
through
it
like
light
through
holes
in
the
roof
of
a
tent
as
they
passed
over
magdalen
bridge
the
willows
shuddered
and
stooped
above
the
water
prophesying
that
rain
was
coming
the
moisture
in
the
air
made
colors
stand
out
sudden
and
separate
even
sounds
seemed
accentuated
from
farmlands
near
and
far
live
things
called
plaintively
cocks
bugled
shrill
alarms
cattle
waded
restlessly
in
summer
meadows
birds
fluttered
out
of
hedges
as
if
setting
out
on
journeys
then
thought
better
of
it
and
hastily
returned
fields
lay
hushed
in
contrast
the
sky
was
torn
and
rutted
clouds
lurched
forward
black
and
sullen
like
artillery
taking
up
positions
detached
wisps
of
mist
hurried
hither
and
thither
like
isolated
bands
of
cavalry
through
the
brooding
stillness
the
coach
swayed
onward
the
horses
hoofs
rattled
as
castanet
accompaniment
to
the
laughter
of
conversation
at
the
long
white
inn
of
the
three
pigeons
they
changed
horses
getting
ready
for
the
climb
out
of
the
valley
past
ashton
rowant
the
golden
woman
called
to
peter
to
come
and
sit
on
the
box
beside
her
she
was
a
pleased
child
patting
his
hand
and
smiling
down
at
him
as
he
took
his
place
she
treated
him
in
public
with
the
same
affection
that
she
used
to
him
in
private
she
had
complained
of
the
faun
man
for
treating
her
like
that
peter
her
eyes
were
immensely
blue
and
wide
this
morning
she
seemed
no
older
than
on
that
first
day
when
he
had
seen
her
in
the
white
room
of
the
happy
cottage
he
watched
her
now
as
she
leant
out
with
her
whip
to
catch
the
reins
which
the
ostler
tossed
up
how
graceful
she
was
how
determinedly
young
and
buoyant
he
touched
her
were
going
to
tell
me
why
cherry
and
the
faun
man
did
she
broke
in
upon
him
i
perhaps
later
ca
you
forget
cherry
just
for
once
i
here
and
and
wo
you
be
content
with
only
me
for
a
little
while
peter
she
spoke
lightly
with
a
pretence
at
wounded
feelings
and
yet
he
had
piqued
her
pride
he
had
noticed
it
before
especially
of
late
the
same
flippancy
of
tone
and
quick
turning
away
of
the
head
when
name
was
mentioned
harry
explained
it
by
saying
that
she
was
envious
of
any
affection
given
to
another
woman
the
new
team
was
full
of
fire
it
took
all
her
attention
girl
so
steady
there
steady
peter
knew
these
grays
he
had
heard
the
faun
man
speak
of
them
as
cats
take
a
devil
of
a
lot
of
she
handled
them
like
a
veteran
woman
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
coquettishly
raising
her
brows
and
laughing
silently
her
eyes
were
between
the
leaders
ears
on
the
road
in
front
of
her
know
ca
help
it
peter
it
the
way
i
was
and
then
what
an
awfully
long
while
you
taken
to
discover
have
but
where
was
the
good
of
my
telling
you
the
faun
man
you
know
it
every
day
of
your
she
pouted
does
but
but
that
is
the
green
of
the
valley
were
falling
away
behind
as
they
rose
higher
woods
sprang
up
standing
tiptoe
drinking
in
the
clouds
the
atmosphere
grew
more
heavy
and
thunderous
the
horses
were
walking
now
scrambling
for
a
foothold
and
zigzagging
from
side
to
side
as
they
took
the
steep
ascent
the
men
dropped
off
the
coach
to
lighten
it
and
went
ahead
harry
caught
hold
of
peter
arm
lorie
did
she
tell
you
when
i
ask
her
she
says
perhaps
ca
get
another
word
out
of
then
harry
saw
a
great
light
bet
you
i
guessed
something
happened
at
the
last
minute
to
delay
him
he
coming
over
from
to
join
us
at
high
wycombe
he
be
there
with
cherry
for
lunch
it
because
of
cherry
to
give
you
a
surprise
that
she
tell
at
the
top
of
the
hill
peter
took
his
place
again
beside
the
golden
woman
he
understood
her
air
of
mystery
now
and
played
up
to
it
in
an
instant
all
his
world
had
changed
he
was
going
to
see
cherry
a
new
sparkle
came
into
his
eyes
the
golden
woman
noticed
it
wakened
what
happened
happened
he
said
a
topper
you
do
mind
my
saying
it
do
you
you
most
awfully
she
looked
at
him
curiously
i
what
makes
you
say
that
know
what
happened
to
the
faun
man
and
cherry
you
can
keep
your
secret
but
i
had
to
thank
me
she
fell
silent
he
talked
on
in
high
spirits
it
must
have
been
the
horses
that
suggested
grace
has
been
so
bloomin
lately
that
his
way
of
putting
it
not
since
cat
meat
died
he
has
to
hire
his
horse
and
cab
now
and
does
seem
to
make
much
profit
out
of
it
he
says
ter
give
back
all
i
earns
and
that
wot
they
calls
bloodsuckers
as
they
came
down
the
hill
by
dashwood
into
high
wycombe
he
ceased
talking
casting
his
eyes
ahead
he
thought
it
just
possible
that
cherry
and
the
faun
man
might
have
walked
out
to
meet
them
the
guard
was
sounding
his
horn
in
long
flourishes
they
were
in
the
town
now
passing
by
the
now
the
coach
was
drawing
up
before
the
hotel
no
one
was
there
to
watch
them
descend
except
the
ostler
and
some
idlers
he
hung
about
while
the
horses
were
taken
out
every
now
and
then
he
stepped
into
the
road
trying
to
make
himself
believe
that
if
he
waited
long
enough
he
would
see
the
girl
with
the
red
lips
and
gray
eyes
hurrying
down
the
street
toward
him
harry
came
out
wrong
that
time
did
i
come
along
in
having
it
was
absurd
this
anxiety
that
he
felt
all
out
of
proportion
and
yet
it
was
always
like
that
when
he
was
going
to
meet
her
it
was
always
like
the
first
time
he
never
lost
the
thrill
of
choking
gladness
and
surprise
each
time
he
discovered
something
new
in
her
of
sweetness
leaving
him
amazed
at
his
former
blindness
harry
was
speaking
to
the
golden
woman
they
not
coming
she
crouched
her
chin
against
her
shoulder
gazing
at
him
innocently
and
my
brother
and
cherry
what
the
secret
look
here
eve
you
ought
to
tell
us
i
certain
he
sent
a
message
some
sort
of
an
you
she
gave
him
a
tantalizing
smile
then
turned
to
peter
shall
know
perhaps
before
we
reach
there
was
a
low
rumble
followed
by
a
crash
the
rain
came
smashing
against
the
panes
they
pushed
back
their
chairs
and
ran
to
look
out
in
an
incredibly
short
time
streets
were
flooded
gutters
were
turbulent
with
muddy
rivers
rain
thudded
against
the
pavement
and
sprayed
up
in
little
fountains
look
to
me
said
harry
though
we
ever
get
as
far
as
to
said
the
golden
woman
the
deluge
commenced
to
slacken
but
the
storm
still
hung
above
the
valley
moaning
and
grumbling
rain
swept
like
smoke
across
the
harry
laughed
to
you
ca
drive
a
to
london
through
that
may
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
we
to
be
back
in
oxford
before
midnight
or
else
perhaps
there
still
time
to
do
it
we
give
it
a
some
of
the
party
burst
into
the
room
say
you
chaps
discovered
a
regular
circus
such
a
rum
old
cock
come
out
and
talk
to
him
the
golden
woman
raised
her
head
not
bring
him
in
here
we
did
think
you
she
lifted
her
hands
and
let
them
fall
despairingly
men
how
selfish
you
are
keeping
everything
that
vulgar
to
yourselves
scuffling
sounded
in
the
passage
and
a
voice
booming
protests
like
this
it
ai
fitting
not
before
a
a
sailor
in
the
loose
blouse
and
baggy
trousers
of
the
royal
navy
was
pushed
through
the
doorway
in
a
deep
bass
voice
he
immediately
commenced
to
excuse
himself
my
fault
he
tugged
at
an
imaginary
lock
on
his
forehead
taylor
i
am
on
a
tryin
to
find
a
nice
gal
wot
appreciate
my
fine
the
golden
woman
stretched
back
her
neck
her
eyes
and
chuckled
you
sure
you
have
any
taylor
the
man
fumbled
at
his
cap
to
used
to
sing
terribly
for
me
now
wo
you
he
struck
an
attitude
flattered
by
the
request
and
hitched
up
his
trousers
it
was
a
ballad
of
betrayed
maidenhood
that
he
sang
solemn
as
a
dirge
and
intended
to
be
hugely
affecting
it
told
of
the
with
her
two
babies
of
a
girl
whose
sweetheart
had
deserted
her
it
had
a
chorus
in
which
with
an
unhappy
wag
of
his
head
the
sailorman
signed
to
his
audience
to
join
ring
those
village
bells
let
all
the
people
know
it
was
on
a
dark
and
stormy
night
one
two
three
perished
in
the
when
they
came
to
the
enumerating
of
precisely
how
many
perished
they
stuck
out
their
fingers
three
times
but
some
of
them
were
content
with
only
three
deaths
in
one
family
they
wanted
to
go
on
counting
then
the
sailorman
would
stop
singing
and
reprove
them
gently
know
young
that
ai
right
it
ai
fitting
to
joke
on
at
last
it
occurred
to
him
that
something
was
amiss
afraid
a
fool
of
mention
it
taylor
they
shouted
their
answer
did
reassure
him
though
they
hurled
it
at
him
in
varying
keys
many
times
he
insisted
on
leaving
making
his
exit
backward
because
he
had
heard
that
a
gentleman
must
always
keep
his
face
toward
a
lady
the
rain
was
over
the
sky
had
a
sorry
look
for
having
been
petulant
the
sun
though
he
still
refused
to
come
out
hung
golden
ladders
from
the
clouds
they
stepped
into
the
street
gazing
up
and
feeling
the
air
with
their
hands
about
it
asked
harry
of
course
we
going
said
the
golden
woman
her
eyes
met
peter
they
seemed
to
beg
him
not
to
call
off
but
to
accompany
her
why
was
she
so
insistent
about
getting
him
to
london
who
was
waiting
there
why
would
she
tell
him
anything
about
the
faun
man
or
cherry
he
calculated
how
long
the
drive
would
take
they
were
not
quite
if
they
continued
the
journey
they
barely
catch
that
last
train
back
again
he
recognized
the
appeal
in
her
eyes
about
it
what
do
you
say
peter
why
i
game
i
some
of
the
men
refused
the
party
was
reduced
to
six
when
they
started
what
a
wet
clean
world
they
entered
it
had
all
been
made
new
and
somehow
tender
the
spray
of
rain
was
still
in
the
air
it
swept
against
their
faces
coolly
vanished
unexplained
and
touched
them
again
without
warning
in
meadows
and
there
was
a
continual
muffled
patter
as
of
little
unseen
people
treading
softly
from
the
back
seats
came
bursts
of
laughter
and
snatches
of
song
mimicking
impressive
chorus
was
on
a
dark
and
stormy
night
one
two
three
perished
in
the
the
golden
woman
bent
her
head
aside
to
find
a
nice
gal
appreciate
my
undoubted
fine
qualities
that
what
all
you
men
are
i
do
you
are
from
the
minute
you
put
on
long
trousers
to
the
last
moment
when
you
step
into
the
grave
men
do
find
her
often
when
they
do
as
likely
as
not
she
does
want
know
a
little
about
that
said
peter
does
lorie
women
very
kind
to
the
men
who
love
are
they
she
flicked
at
the
leaders
so
that
they
leapt
like
stags
young
you
need
civilizing
you
do
know
nothin
as
that
sailorman
would
say
how
many
marriages
are
made
for
love
made
because
women
are
kind
many
a
woman
marries
because
she
can
listen
to
a
man
talking
all
about
himself
without
letting
him
see
that
she
is
bored
by
it
happiness
is
the
only
reality
and
love
love
almost
almost
a
peter
looked
at
her
quietly
she
could
say
jaded
things
like
that
when
she
was
made
so
beautifully
when
everyone
turned
to
look
after
her
when
the
finest
man
in
the
world
would
give
his
life
to
save
her
from
pain
what
had
god
done
with
the
years
of
her
life
she
never
looked
any
older
and
she
was
grateful
perhaps
after
all
harry
was
right
all
her
goodness
had
been
put
into
the
perfection
of
her
body
and
her
soul
had
suffered
she
was
aware
that
his
eyes
rested
on
her
in
judgment
she
tried
to
refrain
from
the
impulse
turning
she
flashed
on
him
a
sudden
smile
bad
to
say
things
like
that
to
you
you
who
hope
for
so
much
from
life
what
the
trouble
was
he
spoke
slowly
love
only
seems
a
delusion
to
people
who
refuse
to
be
a
sprang
up
geese
wandered
across
it
evening
was
falling
early
washing
colors
from
the
landscape
blurring
everything
with
its
watery
light
the
sky
stooped
near
to
earth
threatening
to
tumble
monstrous
with
bulging
clouds
they
drew
up
at
the
inn
at
gerrard
cross
peter
climbed
down
to
stretch
his
legs
while
the
horses
were
being
changed
he
found
his
friends
gathered
about
a
timetable
peering
over
the
shoulders
of
the
man
who
held
it
not
going
to
manage
it
one
was
saying
another
storm
brewing
besides
we
not
making
haste
going
as
leisurely
as
if
we
had
all
the
day
before
us
nothing
for
it
we
have
to
drop
off
and
go
back
by
a
train
leaving
here
in
half
an
hour
said
the
man
who
held
the
going
to
catch
it
getting
sent
down
just
before
your
finals
is
good
harry
interrupted
we
decide
anything
we
better
go
out
and
speak
to
the
case
was
explained
to
the
golden
woman
they
were
most
awfully
sorry
it
was
very
gallant
conduct
on
their
part
but
what
other
choice
had
they
would
she
leave
the
horses
and
the
guard
at
the
inn
and
come
back
with
them
to
oxford
or
could
they
see
her
on
the
train
to
paddington
having
told
the
guard
to
go
on
with
the
harnessing
she
listened
to
them
quietly
when
they
had
finished
she
said
and
i
are
going
to
drive
to
london
you
willing
to
take
a
chance
you
peter
he
broke
into
his
boyish
laugh
be
sport
i
chance
as
the
coach
moved
off
he
turned
and
waved
to
the
others
who
stood
watching
from
the
common
the
guard
from
his
back
seat
raising
the
horn
gave
them
a
farewell
flourish
in
his
heart
of
hearts
peter
wished
that
he
were
among
them
but
well
the
golden
woman
had
a
secret
she
was
going
to
tell
it
to
him
it
had
something
to
do
with
cherry
and
it
would
have
been
decent
to
have
left
her
to
finish
the
drive
alone
to
london
he
get
the
last
train
back
from
paddington
barring
accidents
she
was
speaking
to
him
better
at
last
we
alone
you
think
we
do
it
he
what
there
in
she
drew
her
brows
together
peter
what
does
it
matter
you
take
life
so
they
laughed
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
she
asked
he
looked
puzzled
life
i
mean
she
added
know
it
what
he
answered
vaguely
taking
care
to
avoid
mentioning
cherry
may
travel
for
a
year
perhaps
kay
will
come
with
me
after
that
going
into
my
father
the
golden
woman
face
became
grave
beneath
its
gravity
was
a
flame
of
excitement
her
voice
trembled
and
reached
him
softly
not
what
i
meant
that
not
doing
anything
with
life
those
things
are
incidents
externals
i
meant
are
you
going
to
live
life
or
are
you
going
to
miss
everything
life
an
ocean
full
of
enduring
dotted
with
a
few
islands
are
you
going
to
be
an
explorer
or
are
you
going
to
miss
everything
odd
that
she
of
all
persons
should
have
asked
him
that
he
remembered
how
harry
had
said
that
she
was
a
ship
always
setting
sail
for
new
lands
and
never
coming
to
anchor
explorer
i
first
see
the
a
strand
of
her
hair
broke
loose
and
fluttered
about
her
eyes
put
it
back
she
said
wish
you
do
her
hands
were
occupied
with
the
reins
he
leant
across
her
as
his
face
came
under
hers
she
held
her
breath
to
him
it
was
nothing
the
horses
feeling
her
hands
go
slack
broke
into
a
gallop
for
a
moment
she
lost
control
of
them
when
she
had
quieted
them
she
turned
to
him
impulsively
you
a
her
eyes
held
his
with
an
expression
of
appeal
and
challenge
then
faltered
as
though
they
were
afraid
to
look
at
him
her
excitement
communicated
itself
he
was
embarrassed
he
understand
he
guessed
that
she
was
in
trouble
and
was
asking
for
his
kindness
woman
how
easily
you
and
i
say
things
like
that
if
cherry
had
said
it
to
me
or
if
you
had
said
it
to
the
faun
man
how
much
more
she
cut
him
short
they
had
traveled
half
a
mile
in
silence
when
she
whispered
easily
in
the
west
behind
them
the
sky
began
to
burn
little
tongues
of
flame
licked
the
edges
of
black
clouds
mists
writhed
and
drove
across
the
sinking
sun
peter
stood
up
in
his
seat
looking
back
it
was
a
glimpse
of
hell
he
glanced
ahead
everything
over
there
was
blackness
trees
looked
blasted
they
bowed
their
heads
roads
and
fields
were
empty
there
was
no
life
no
color
in
the
meadows
in
for
it
he
said
rain
began
to
patter
softly
at
first
wind
was
getting
up
and
breathed
across
the
country
in
a
long
sigh
he
spread
a
coat
across
the
golden
woman
shoulders
she
did
thank
him
gathering
the
reins
more
firmly
in
her
hands
she
whipped
up
the
horses
their
heads
were
bent
together
behind
them
out
of
on
the
the
guard
huddled
she
spoke
going
to
be
late
i
intended
we
should
be
late
i
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
others
i
knew
that
you
stick
by
and
again
she
said
were
talking
of
women
not
being
men
are
kind
to
the
women
who
love
she
had
changed
her
face
had
sharpened
out
of
its
contentment
usually
its
expression
was
lazy
and
laughing
but
now
pain
had
come
into
it
it
was
intense
and
thin
with
purpose
it
was
purpose
she
had
always
lacked
he
tried
to
find
a
word
for
the
new
thing
that
he
found
in
her
was
it
only
the
distortion
that
the
storm
was
working
a
flash
of
lightning
slit
the
heavens
it
ripped
the
clouds
like
a
blade
a
shattering
crash
the
dynamite
of
the
gods
exploding
darkness
came
down
another
flash
trees
leant
forward
like
fugitives
with
arms
extended
and
she
her
face
was
white
and
dominant
it
looked
beautiful
and
snakes
of
loosened
hair
blew
about
it
she
no
longer
crouched
her
head
she
sat
tall
and
defiant
the
rain
splashing
down
on
her
what
strength
she
had
in
her
hands
she
held
in
the
quivering
horses
speaking
to
them
now
harshly
now
caressingly
they
pricked
up
their
ears
listening
for
her
voice
he
found
the
word
for
the
new
thing
that
had
come
to
her
it
was
passion
nearer
what
did
you
mean
when
you
told
me
you
had
guessed
my
secret
faun
man
she
took
him
up
lorie
he
and
i
had
our
first
quarrel
this
morning
we
both
wasted
our
lives
waiting
for
something
something
that
could
never
never
i
ca
bring
myself
to
not
in
his
way
he
told
me
this
morning
it
does
matter
what
he
told
me
it
hurt
me
to
hear
him
speak
like
that
so
strongly
and
quietly
and
sadly
lorie
and
i
drifted
let
life
slip
by
we
wakened
we
then
like
a
child
appealing
against
injustice
said
i
had
a
heart
that
i
was
made
of
stone
not
like
other
women
it
not
true
that
different
is
it
peter
and
again
it
peter
and
then
hurt
to
be
blamed
for
not
giving
giving
what
would
be
his
to
take
if
he
were
the
right
right
man
that
what
cherry
says
how
does
a
woman
know
who
is
the
right
man
she
avoided
a
direct
answer
right
man
is
always
born
too
late
or
too
early
or
else
he
wasting
himself
on
someone
who
does
want
it
was
a
city
of
the
dead
that
they
were
entering
rain
swept
the
streets
in
sudden
and
vindictive
volleys
lamps
shone
weakly
some
were
extinguished
few
people
were
about
at
ealing
they
halted
for
their
last
change
be
goin
any
further
the
guard
suggested
when
he
was
informed
to
the
contrary
he
glanced
up
at
the
drenched
faces
he
seemed
to
see
a
thing
that
startled
him
while
he
hurried
the
ostlers
with
the
harnessing
he
tried
not
to
look
at
those
white
patches
in
the
dusk
his
eyes
returned
to
them
unwillingly
fascinated
when
he
had
released
the
leaders
heads
he
stepped
back
and
swung
himself
up
behind
as
the
coach
lunged
into
the
storm
there
was
barely
time
to
reach
paddington
peter
calculated
if
he
missed
the
train
the
consequences
would
be
grave
he
asked
the
golden
woman
to
hurry
she
listened
but
made
no
attempt
to
quicken
their
pace
she
did
seem
at
all
disturbed
by
his
dilemma
he
almost
suspected
her
of
holding
in
the
horses
too
late
to
leave
her
now
as
they
trotted
through
the
premature
night
he
began
to
ask
himself
questions
why
had
she
been
so
determined
to
finish
the
journey
why
had
she
shown
such
eagerness
to
be
alone
with
him
he
leant
forward
lorie
cherry
she
tossed
her
head
impatiently
you
it
always
then
lorie
is
he
going
to
meet
us
he
does
what
difference
will
it
make
me
not
much
but
to
you
you
know
then
and
you
be
i
her
indifference
spurred
him
into
earnestness
from
differing
points
of
view
the
golden
woman
and
cherry
used
the
same
arguments
if
he
could
convince
her
he
could
perhaps
convince
cherry
in
fighting
for
the
faun
man
it
was
his
own
battle
he
was
fighting
do
know
yourself
golden
woman
you
do
know
his
value
become
a
habit
you
miss
him
terribly
he
been
too
extravagant
in
the
giving
of
himself
he
made
you
selfish
if
you
were
to
lose
him
if
suddenly
from
giving
you
everything
he
were
to
give
you
nothing
her
voice
reached
him
bitterly
what
he
threatens
to
starve
me
after
giving
me
everything
he
did
say
it
in
those
words
but
what
do
i
care
do
care
you
caring
now
all
day
long
you
been
caring
if
he
is
there
to
meet
us
shall
be
he
spoke
eagerly
wo
you
may
think
be
glad
but
you
be
without
him
just
think
you
kept
him
marking
time
all
these
years
he
expected
and
expected
you
banked
on
him
felt
safe
because
of
him
foolish
you
ca
cheat
at
the
game
of
life
you
ca
even
cheat
yourself
in
the
end
you
bound
to
play
she
did
answer
wo
be
glad
if
he
not
silence
he
going
to
meet
us
he
does
she
went
no
further
cherry
be
there
her
face
flashed
down
on
him
white
and
stabbing
always
later
she
whispered
me
without
a
word
they
passed
through
tunnels
of
muted
houses
the
sky
closed
down
on
them
the
rain
drew
a
curtain
about
them
the
slap
of
the
horses
hoofs
upon
the
paving
started
echoes
traffic
slipped
by
them
spectrelike
as
if
moving
in
another
world
now
it
was
between
shuttered
shops
of
regent
street
that
they
trotted
at
last
trafalgar
square
vast
and
chaotic
a
pagan
temple
from
which
the
roof
had
fallen
they
strained
forward
from
the
box
searching
through
the
darkness
from
the
entrance
to
the
métropole
light
streamed
across
the
pavement
it
was
the
end
of
their
journey
as
the
horn
sounded
a
man
stepped
out
from
shelter
for
a
moment
but
no
he
had
only
been
sent
to
take
the
coach
to
the
stables
as
they
clattered
to
a
standstill
several
guests
came
out
on
to
the
steps
of
the
hotel
to
watch
them
the
guard
climbed
down
and
ran
to
the
leaders
heads
no
one
was
there
to
greet
them
no
one
who
was
familiar
she
laughed
high
up
excitedly
did
i
tell
you
there
he
agreed
reluctantly
of
she
touched
his
hand
and
caught
her
breath
i
said
neither
of
them
care
you
and
i
we
still
he
was
sorry
for
her
guessing
her
disappointment

lorie
been
there
it
would
have
spelt
forgiveness
big
ben
boomed

he
started
i
dished
i
ca

not
going
back

do
want
to
leave
me

he
was
embarrassed
he
did
know
what
to
make
of
her
she
was
on
his
hands
he
ought
to
be
in
oxford
evidently
she
had
been
harder
hit
than
she
acknowledged
he
tried
to
speak
cheerfully
here
it
time
we
became
sensible
that
chap
waiting
for
us
to
scramble
down
he
wants
to
take
the
horses
let
go
into
the
hotel
i
engage
a
room
for

those
wet

made
of
it
when
i
seen
you
settled
i
toddle
off
to
topbury
and
spend
the
night
with
my
you
she
glanced
at
him
slantingly
to
his
immense
surprise
she
brought
the
whip
down
smartly
across
the
horses
as
the
leaders
darted
forward
the
guard
taken
unaware
was
thrown
off
his
balance
as
peter
looked
back
through
the
steaming
mist
he
saw
him
picking
himself
up
from
the
pavement
waving
his
arms
and
shouting
utterly
bewildered
by
her
shifting
moods
he
turned
to
her
left
that
chap
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
the
game
is
i
want
you
to
drive
me
to
topbury
and
anyhow
the
embankment
all
out
of
the
not
driving
you
to
topbury
he
spoke
more
sternly
you
must
tell
me
you
brought
me
to
london
and
by
jove
i
almost
believe
you
tried
to
make
me
miss
my
train
it
is
sporting
why
do
you
turn
back
to
the
métropole
get
you
a
room
and
many
people
to
see
us
she
said
shortly
he
had
only
one
means
of
stopping
her
to
catch
hold
of
the
reins
too
risky
he
gazed
about
him
wondering
what
to
do
they
were
traversing
the
embankment
it
was
empty
save
for
outcasts
huddled
on
benches
like
corpses
the
night
looked
sodden
the
river
gleamed
murkily
lights
on
bridges
hanging
like
chains
shone
obscurely
she
was
mocking
him
in
low
caressing
tones
do
want
to
leave
me
say
you
the
odd
repetition
of
the
question
struck
him
he
had
missed
its
first
significance
it
could
be
he
pressed
nearer
peering
into
her
face
he
caught
the
hungry
pleading
in
her
eyes
the
mad
defiance
mean
you
never
meant
eve
you
too
good
a
she
halted
the
horses
and
gazed
down
on
him
smilingly
she
shook
her
head
slowly
denying
his
assertion
of
her
goodness
guessed
he
drew
himself
upright
the
passion
in
her
voice
appalled
him
her
arms
went
about
him
cold
wet
lips
were
pressing
his
mouth
dear
you
dear
he
thrust
her
from
him
he
was
choking
her
lips
they
scorched
him
he
had
seen
in
all
women
faces
the
likeness
to
his
mother
and
kay
but
now
a
bedraggled
creature
in
tattered
finery
with
a
broken
plume
nodding
evilly
across
her
forehead
struggled
from
a
bench
shuffled
across
the
pavement
and
whined
up
at
him
he
took
no
notice
he
tried
not
to
believe
what
had
been
meant
through
their
nervous
silence
trees
shuddered
the
muffled
skirmish
of
the
rain
thudded
the
golden
woman
was
watching
him
a
gleam
of
hatred
in
her
eyes
at
first
the
reflection
of
his
own
loathing
then
as
pity
replaced
his
loathing
a
look
of
horror
spread
she
sank
her
face
in
her
hands
her
fingers
locked
and
twisted
she
looked
like
one
who
had
become
sane
and
remembered
her
madness
am
i
what
have
i
done
she
whispered
the
questions
over
and
over
the
storm
beat
down
upon
her
shoulders
he
sat
like
one
turned
to
stone
not
daring
to
touch
her
powerless
to
put
his
pity
into
and
of
this
the
bedraggled
whining
up
from
the
pavement
was
sole
witness
a
policeman
tramped
out
of
the
distance
you
none
o
that
this
to
the
streetwalker
to
the
golden
woman
the
matter
with
the
me
lady
she
came
to
herself
the
was
limping
into
the
shadows
her
eyes
followed
her
with
fascination
she
felt
for
her
purse
not
finding
it
she
commenced
unfastening
the
brooch
that
was
at
her
neck
seeing
her
intention
peter
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
she
stayed
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
calling
to
the
woman
she
leant
down
from
the
box
and
said
something
the
policeman
waited
stolidly
he
repeated
his
question
the
matter
with
the
me
lady
she
swung
the
coach
round
there
was
no
explanation
of
that
wild
drive
back
through
the
night
peter
saved
but
a
blurred
remembrance
scarcely
a
word
was
spoken
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
said
after
they
had
struck
the
open
country
they
went
at
a
gallop
most
of
the
journey
every
now
and
then
they
drew
up
at
a
darkened
inn
he
climbed
down
from
the
box
and
hammered
on
a
closed
door
a
window
opened
a
rapid
explanation
grumbling
sleepy
men
appeared
only
partly
dressed
carrying
lanterns
horses
were
taken
out
and
a
fresh
team
harnessed
as
the
dawn
came
up
pale
and
haggard
he
saw
her
face
it
was
and
ashen
he
would
never
forget
it
every
year
showed
the
golden
hair
had
broken
loose
it
was
the
only
young
thing
left
she
was
no
longer
the
golden
woman
he
drove
that
night
beside
the
figure
of
repentance
hills
taken
cruelly
at
a
gallop
cocks
crowing
unawakened
towns
the
waking
country
he
pieced
her
into
his
experience
what
was
it
that
women
wanted
to
be
married
and
not
to
be
married
to
accept
the
flattery
of
being
loved
and
not
to
return
it
riska
his
aunt
jehane
glory
cherry
all
the
women
he
had
known
they
passed
before
him
he
tried
to
read
their
eyes
their
heads
were
bowed
all
that
he
could
learn
of
them
was
the
pathetic
frailty
of
their
bodies
marching
through
the
meadows
came
oxford
its
spires
indomitably
pointed
against
the
clouds
now
they
were
traveling
the
austere
length
of
high
street
at
carfax
they
turned
on
folly
bridge
they
drew
up
she
had
brought
him
back
he
wanted
to
say
something
generous
he
loves
you
if
he
asks
you
again
she
nodded
he
asks
me
she
said
brokenly
he
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
river
golden
in
the
early
morning
silver
with
mists
curling
from
off
it
he
plunged
in
at
a
point
opposite
the
calvary
barge
as
he
swam
he
looked
back
from
the
coach
high
on
the
arch
of
the
bridge
her
eyes
followed
him
just
before
he
landed
she
raised
the
whip
the
horses
strained
forward
running
through
the
meadows
he
came
to
the
wall
which
went
about
calvary
found
a
foothold
and
dropped
safely
over
after
he
had
undressed
he
hid
his
dripping
clothing
he
was
in
bed
and
sleeping
soundly
when
later
in
the
morning
his
scout
came
to
wake
him
chapter
xliii
an
unfinished
poem
strong
sunlight
streamed
across
the
foot
of
his
bed
below
in
the
quad
he
could
hear
the
clatter
of
being
cleared
away
fumbling
beneath
his
pillow
he
pulled
out
his
watch
ten
time
he
dressed
and
got
to
work
less
than
a
fortnight
till
his
finals
and
he
lost
a
day
already
a
sound
of
running
on
the
stairs
someone
was
entering
his
outer
room
i
still
in
bed
who
is
it
the
bedroom
door
flew
open
harry
stood
panting
on
the
threshold
holding
a
london
paper
in
his
hand
for
all
his
haste
he
did
say
a
word
he
simply
stared
stared
rather
weakly
and
stupidly
as
though
he
forgotten
what
he
come
about
his
lips
quivered
the
twitching
of
his
fingers
made
the
paper
crackle
peter
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
back
all
right
old
man
why
he
saw
harry
face
clearly
it
was
drawn
and
ghastly
look
like
that
what
is
it
for
god
sake
tell
he
threw
back
the
clothes
leapt
out
and
snatched
the
paper
standing
in
the
sunlight
he
caught
the
to
save
others
his
eyes
skipped
the
matter
below
it
gathering
the
sense
the
crowded
hour
in
hyde
park
yesterday
afternoon
lost
control
of
his
horse
satan
bolted
to
where
children
were
playing
swerved
aside
rode
purposely
into
an
iron
fence
thrown
and
broke
his
the
paper
fell
from
his
hand
he
picked
it
up
and
reread
it
some
mistake
he
would
believe
it
the
faun
man
dead
he
been
so
brimming
with
life
never
again
to
hear
his
mandolin
strumming
never
again
to
hear
his
gallant
laughter
to
walk
through
the
roses
at
and
he
would
not
be
there
peter
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
clenching
his
forehead
in
his
hands
the
voice
the
gestures
everything
everything
that
had
been
so
essentially
the
faun
man
he
wanted
to
recall
before
he
could
forget
yer
gal
ai
all
yer
thought
and
for
everyfing
yer
bought
she
do
seem
to
care
he
could
see
him
bending
over
the
strings
slyly
smiling
he
had
been
of
such
high
courage
that
he
could
coin
humor
out
of
his
own
unhappiness
then
like
a
minor
air
played
softly
he
loves
you
if
he
asks
you
again
and
the
golden
woman
broken
assent
he
asks
she
had
kept
him
waiting
too
long
he
had
asked
her
for
the
last
time
that
morning
he
could
ask
her
again
however
much
she
desired
it
could
she
blamed
him
for
his
first
neglect
of
her
had
made
it
an
excuse
for
her
own
unfaithfulness
he
had
met
her
his
neglect
of
her
had
been
simply
that
he
was
dead
word
came
two
days
later
they
had
brought
him
home
to
that
evening
peter
gained
leave
of
absence
the
name
was
embroidered
in
geraniums
on
the
velvet
of
the
turf
the
train
halted
long
enough
for
him
to
alight
then
pulled
out
puffing
laboriously
it
seemed
an
affront
that
people
should
be
journeying
when
across
the
fields
the
faun
man
lay
his
journey
forever
at
an
end
only
one
other
passenger
got
out
a
young
chap
in
flannels
and
a
who
was
instantly
embraced
by
a
girl
they
sauntered
to
where
a
was
standing
and
drove
away
into
the
evening
stillness
their
heads
bent
together
their
laughter
floating
back
in
snatches
peter
set
out
reluctantly
by
a
through
he
want
to
prove
to
himself
that
it
had
happened
he
was
trying
to
imagine
that
he
had
come
on
one
of
his
surprise
visits
he
would
find
the
faun
man
dreaming
sprawled
like
a
lean
hound
in
the
twilight
of
the
terraced
garden
the
sun
hung
large
and
low
in
the
west
a
breeze
swept
the
country
with
a
contented
humming
bowing
the
heads
of
the
corn
in
the
distance
above
curious
corner
chiseled
in
the
greenness
of
the
hill
the
white
cross
glistened
through
trees
a
spire
shot
up
beneath
boughs
thatched
roofs
of
the
village
showed
faintly
he
rounded
a
bend
the
house
to
which
he
was
going
gazed
down
on
him
it
had
the
look
of
a
house
of
death
its
windows
shone
valiantly
above
the
pallor
of
the
the
splendor
of
the
fading
west
he
climbed
the
path
came
to
the
threshold
the
door
was
hospitably
open
like
birds
hopping
in
and
out
of
a
hedge
the
breeze
and
the
fragrance
of
flowers
came
and
went
he
knocked
no
one
answered
he
tiptoed
in
a
breathless
silence
mounting
the
stairs
he
came
to
the
door
with
the
iron
latch
which
gave
entrance
to
the
faun
man
bedroom
flowers
he
had
always
loved
flowers
they
were
strewn
on
a
bed
unnaturally
white
and
unruffled
an
unnatural
peace
was
everywhere
the
sheet
was
turned
back
from
the
face
the
brown
slight
hands
stretched
straightly
down
each
was
held
by
a
woman
who
knelt
beside
him
with
her
head
bowed
the
attitude
of
the
women
was
tragic
with
jealousy
how
long
and
graceful
he
looked
in
death
how
gaunt
and
tired
all
the
striving
the
brave
pretending
the
famished
yearning
which
he
had
disguised
showed
plainly
now
a
smile
hung
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
a
little
mocking
perhaps
yet
tender
a
bruise
was
on
his
forehead
he
had
the
look
of
one
who
having
been
puzzled
understood
life
at
last
and
was
content
peter
felt
that
he
had
intruded
he
had
no
right
to
stay
there
those
bowed
heads
reproached
him
he
felt
what
men
often
feel
when
death
is
present
the
body
had
been
put
out
to
usury
at
the
end
of
the
trafficking
it
belonged
to
women
as
it
had
belonged
to
a
woman
before
the
trafficking
commenced
he
wandered
out
into
the
garden
twilight
weakened
into
darkness
his
feet
were
always
coming
back
to
the
window
he
stood
beneath
it
looking
up
to
where
she
knelt
if
it
were
only
for
a
moment
surely
she
would
come
to
him
again
he
entered
no
stir
of
life
in
the
house
he
peered
into
the
bedroom
she
had
not
moved
since
he
left
beyond
her
was
the
door
which
led
into
the
faun
man
study
noiselessly
he
stole
across
to
it
and
raised
the
latch
the
room
was
in
darkness
set
against
the
open
window
was
a
desk
moonlight
drifted
in
on
it
a
chair
was
pushed
back
from
it
a
pen
lay
carelessly
on
the
waiting
for
the
master
to
return
here
it
was
possible
to
believe
that
the
mind
still
lived
and
worked
a
movement
he
stretched
out
his
hand
someone
rose
into
the
shaft
of
moonlight
came
the
face
of
a
man
oh
it
you
harry
he
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
lamp
they
talked
softly
in
short
whispered
sentences
on
the
floor
on
tables
on
chairs
books
and
manuscripts
lay
scattered
the
breeze
blowing
in
at
the
window
turned
pages
as
though
an
invisible
person
were
searching
a
sheet
of
paper
lying
uppermost
on
the
desk
fluttered
across
the
room
to
where
harry
sat
he
stooped
picked
it
up
ran
his
eye
over
it
and
handed
it
to
peter
last
thing
he
wrote
thinking
of
her
to
the
peter
took
it
and
read
came
to
me
and
the
world
was
glad
was
winter
but
hedges
leapt
white
with
may
with
snow
of
flowers
my
fields
were
clad
madly
and
merrily
passed
each
day
and
next
day
and
next
day
while
all
around
by
others
naught
but
the
ice
was
found
ungrateful
heart
were
you
ever
sad
she
was
coming
to
you
from
the
first
i
said
she
turned
to
me
her
eager
head
clutching
at
what
my
thoughts
did
say
went
from
me
and
the
world
was
sad
was
and
hedges
were
all
with
snow
of
winter
my
fields
were
clad
darkly
and
drearily
passed
each
day
and
next
day
and
next
day
while
all
around
by
others
naught
but
were
found
foolish
heart
were
you
ever
glad
she
was
going
from
you
from
the
first
i
said
she
turned
to
me
her
eager
head
clutching
at
what
my
thoughts
did
his
life
an
unfinished
peter
leant
out
to
return
it
to
harry
but
found
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
chair
the
lamp
burnt
itself
out
the
chill
of
dawn
was
in
the
air
through
the
window
the
sky
was
gathering
color
like
life
coming
back
to
the
cheeks
of
the
dead
the
door
opened
slowly
stiff
with
long
sitting
he
staggered
to
his
feet
pressing
her
finger
against
her
lips
she
motioned
him
to
be
silent
glancing
at
harry
she
whispered
first
sleep
in
two
days
poor
as
he
followed
her
across
the
dusk
of
the
a
pool
of
gold
caught
his
attention
it
glittered
on
the
pillow
by
the
face
of
the
faun
man
the
golden
woman
lay
crouched
like

heard
her
slow
feet
trailing
up
the
stairs
as
he
walked
to
the
station
through
rustling
the
sun
lifted
up
his
scarlet

shaking

his

rose
singing

he
leant
across
the
table
tapping
with
his
trembling
fingers
why
i
went
to
hell
it
sounds
weak
to
say
it
i
went
to
hell
because
i
had
no
woman
to
hold
me
back
with
love
if
i
could
have
glory
but
she
be
thinking
of
marrying

insisted

be
of

twirled
his
mustaches
covering
his
confusion
know
good
beer
when

peter
leant
back
laughing
something
to
start
on
is
it
next
day
he
told
glory
willing
both
of
in
searching
the
papers
for
advertisements
he
came
upon
an
announcement
henley
the
winged
thrush
comfortable
riverside

pleasantly
situated
suitable
for
artist
or
poet
desirous
of
combining
lucrative
business
with
pleasure
etc
a
bargain
reason
for
selling
going
to
he
remembered
that
last
night
of
the
regatta
the
morning
the
glittering
river
and
the
breakfast
in
the
arbor
with
cherry
the
purchase
was
arranged
ocky
glory
and
grace
went
down
to
see
the
place
grace
was
to
look
after
the
if
there
were
any
if
there
were
he
was
to
help
in
serving
customers
for
a
reason
which
he
would
not
explain
peter
refused
to
accompany
them
on
their
tour
of
inspection
during
those
last
days
before
he
and
kay
set
out
on
their
year
of
youngness
he
saw
glory
often
from
her
he
learnt
of
riska
and
her
many
how
they
always
fell
short
of
marriage
because
she
carried
on
two
at
once
or
because
of
the
deceit
concerning
her
father
she
was
getting
desperate
she
had
been
taught
that
the
sole
purpose
of
her
being
was
to
catch
a
man
so
far
she
had
failed
she
still
had
hope
there
was
hardcastle
in
a
sly
way
she
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
exactly
how
and
where
she
had
pledged
glory
not
to
divulge
and
peter
learnt
of
eustace
eustace
had
gone
to
canada
to
take
up
farming
with
money
lent
by
barrington
jehane
with
her
tragic
knack
of
hanging
her
expectations
on
loosened
nails
boasted
that
eustace
was
to
be
her
salvation
perhaps
he
was
careless
perhaps
he
had
gained
a
distaste
for
the
atmosphere
of
falsity
which
had
formed
his
home
environment
in
any
case
he
wrote
more
and
more
rarely
and
showed
less
and
less
desire
for
his
mother
to
join
him
as
the
period
of
his
absence
lengthened
jehane
as
she
had
done
with
his
father
before
him
invented
good
news
when
good
news
was
lacking
bolstering
her
pride
in
public
her
children
despite
her
sacrifices
for
them
watched
her
with
judging
eyes
and
directly
they
arrived
at
a
reasoning
age
began
to
detect
her
hollowness
eustace
was
gone
glory
was
going
riska
failing
another
accident
would
soon
be
married
to
hardcastle
only
moggs
ma
left
over
as
they
had
called
her
because
of
her
tininess
remained
she
was
a
child
of
twelve
submissive
in
her
ways
colorless
in
character
and
with
ocky
weak
affectionateness
of
temperament
it
was
the
morning
of
kay
and
peter
departure
during
breakfast
the
last
meal
together
barrington
had
sat
looking
at
the
landscape
by
cuyp
as
he
always
did
in
moments
of
crisis
the
cab
was
at
the
door
the
luggage
had
been
carried
out
the
adventure
in
search
of
youngness
had
all
but
begun
the
door
bell
rang
and
the
knocker
sounded
a
telegram
was
handed
in
barrington
opened
it
glanced
at
the
signature
from
jehane
as
he
read
it
his
face
grew
grave
he
passed
it
to
nan
and
led
peter
aside
tell
kay
it
about
riska
she
run
off
with
that
fellow
hardcastle
whether
she
married
to
him
or
it
does
his
own
rendering
of
the
situation
was
plain
fruit
ready
to
fall
to
the
they
entered
the
cab
driving
into
the
great
worldwideness
and
riska
with
her
impatient
mouth
and
pretty
face
she
also
in
her
stormy
way
had
gone
in
quest
of
youngness
chapter
xlv
love
knocks
at
kay
door
the
castle
stood
like
a
gleaming
skull
balancing
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
the
centuries
had
picked
it
clean
through
empty
sockets
about
which
moss
gathered
it
watched
white
wings
of
shipping
flit
mothlike
across
the
blue
waters
of
the
gulf
of
spezia
it
had
been
the
terror
of
sailors
once
a
stronghold
of
pirates
saracens
and
genoese
fierce
men
who
had
built
the
hunchback
town
that
huddled
against
the
rocks
behind
it
now
it
was
nothing
but
a
crumbling
shell
picturesque
and
meaningless
save
to
tourists
and
artists
the
tourists
came
because
byron
had
written
in
its
shadow
and
the
artists
one
of
them
had
left
his
canvas
on
an
easel
in
a
broken
archway
kay
tripped
across
and
looked
at
it
a
wild
piece
of
composition
all
white
and
green
and
orange
splashed
in
with
vigor
with
the
fierce
italian
sky
above
it
it
interpreted
the
spirit
of
the
place
its
loneliness
its
lawless
past
its
brooding
sense
of
unsatisfied
passion
she
turned
away
awed
by
its
power
a
little
frightened
by
its
intensity
it
made
her
feel
that
from
behind
tumbled
mastery
eyes
were
gazing
at
her
climbing
the
splintered
tower
she
watched
the
sunset
in
the
great
stillness
she
could
hear
stones
dropping
down
the
sheer
cliff
into
the
racing
tide
beneath
she
had
forgotten
how
time
was
passing
that
low
bass
humming
it
was
the
voice
of
the
sea
it
seemed
as
though
the
sun
voice
spoke
to
her
across
the
blue
of
the
mediterranean
a
golden
track
led
up
to
the
horizon
at
its
end
a
fiery
disc
hung
like
a
gong
against
which
the
waves
tapped
gently
it
had
been
a
tumultuous
day
a
day
of
excited
fears
winged
hopes
and
strategies
harry
was
coming
peter
had
received
the
astounding
telegram
that
morning
chap
this
was
sent
off
from
genoa
he
almost
here
by
now
why
on
earth
did
he
let
us
know
earlier
why
had
he
kay
knew
because
if
he
had
there
would
have
been
still
time
for
her
to
turn
him
back
the
persistent
boy
he
was
always
quite
certain
that
he
had
only
to
make
up
his
mind
and
he
get
his
desire
she
did
like
him
any
the
less
for
that
but
no
she
would
be
there
to
meet
him
she
had
excused
herself
to
peter
and
had
accompanied
him
to
the
pier
at
which
the
steamer
called
on
its
way
from
lerici
to
spezia
she
had
waved
and
waved
till
he
was
nearly
out
of
sight
then
she
had
fled
why
she
could
say
could
say
exactly
but
very
nearly
she
had
forbidden
her
boy
to
come
and
he
was
coming
she
was
secretly
elated
to
find
herself
defied
after
all
she
did
own
italy
and
but
harry
was
making
the
journey
to
see
italy
nor
to
see
peter
she
was
well
aware
of
that
peter
was
so
she
had
persuaded
one
of
her
fishermen
friends
to
sail
her
across
the
gulf
to
porto
venere
down
there
in
the
sleepy
harbor
he
was
waiting
his
brown
eyes
lazily
watching
his
glittering
his
fingers
rolling
cigarettes
not
at
all
perturbed
but
wondering
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
why
she
so
long
delayed
and
harry
he
too
would
be
wondering
thinking
her
unkind
peter
had
probably
brought
him
back
to
san
terenzo
by
now
they
would
have
been
on
the
lookout
for
her
directly
the
steamer
rounded
the
cypressed
headland
when
they
had
found
her
on
the
pier
they
would
have
made
haste
to
the
yellow
villa
in
which
they
lived
which
had
been
shelley
and
again
they
had
found
her
she
could
imagine
it
all
just
what
had
happened
peter
discreet
apologies
and
harry
amused
suspicion
that
he
was
being
punished
his
laughter
she
could
imagine
that
as
well
he
always
laughed
when
he
was
hurt
or
annoyed
kay
clasped
her
hands
it
was
rotten
of
her
not
to
go
to
him
all
day
she
had
wanted
to
be
with
him
he
had
traveled
all
the
way
from
london
to
get
a
glimpse
of
her
and
yet
knowing
that
she
sat
on
in
the
ruined
castle
while
the
reluctant
day
like
a
naughty
child
at
saffron
skirts
held
high
stepped
lingeringly
down
the
purple
hills
keeping
the
sun
waiting
she
was
trying
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
to
peter
she
was
everything
more
than
ever
this
past
year
had
taught
her
that
he
made
no
plans
for
the
future
in
which
she
was
not
to
share
it
was
just
as
it
had
been
when
they
were
girl
and
boy
he
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
they
were
always
to
live
together
the
thought
that
she
should
marry
never
entered
his
head
save
for
the
boy
it
would
not
have
entered
hers
but
the
boy
long
ago
when
she
could
see
him
she
had
heard
him
playing
in
the
it
was
something
like
that
now
since
she
had
left
england
his
letters
had
followed
her
sometimes
she
had
answered
them
sometimes
she
had
answered
them
casually
sometimes
she
had
had
fits
of
contrition
and
had
written
him
volumes
compact
histories
of
her
thoughts
and
doings
it
made
no
difference
whether
she
was
punctual
or
neglectful
like
a
familiar
friend
in
unfamiliar
places
his
handwriting
was
always
ahead
of
her
travels
waiting
to
greet
her
does
he
say
peter
would
ask
her
then
she
would
read
him
carefully
edited
extracts
nice
polite
information
entirely
innocuous
peter
had
guessed
he
must
how
preposterous
it
had
seemed
when
harry
had
first
written
her
that
he
loved
her
she
had
regarded
him
in
the
aspect
of
a
lover
did
want
to
it
had
seemed
almost
treachery
to
peter
but
now
now
it
seem
at
all
preposterous
only
wonderful
and
true
and
puzzling
how
long
ago
was
it
eight
months
since
he
had
told
her
she
had
been
a
child
then
seventeen
with
cornflower
eyes
and
blowy
daffodil
hair
the
knowledge
that
she
was
loved
had
startled
her
into
womanhood
she
ought
to
be
getting
back
but
peter
peter
from
whom
she
had
no
secrets
did
know
she
dared
not
tell
him
and
harry
was
there
peter
had
given
her
so
much
this
year
of
romance
and
yet
with
all
his
giving
he
might
give
her
his
whole
life
he
could
give
her
this
different
thing
that
harry
offered
she
rose
to
go
her
attention
was
arrested
it
could
be
gazing
sheer
down
she
leant
out
across
the
broken
parapet
in
the
racing
tide
through
its
treacherous
whirlpools
a
man
was
swimming
she
could
see
his
reddish
hair
and
beard
shine
as
they
caught
the
sunset
as
he
lunged
forward
they
sank
beneath
the
surface
she
held
her
breath
he
was
keeping
near
in
to
the
rocks
so
near
that
had
she
dropped
a
stone
it
would
have
struck
him
with
all
his
fighting
he
was
making
little
progress
it
was
too
far
to
the
town
to
run
for
help
moreover
none
of
the
ever
ventured
there
she
wanted
to
cry
out
encouragement
she
feared
to
distract
him
from
his
effort
now
in
rounding
a
bend
he
was
lost
to
sight
ah
there
he
was
again
she
saw
where
he
was
going
to
the
steps
which
wound
down
the
precipice
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
pulled
himself
up
dragging
his
body
across
the
rocks
like
a
fly
which
had
been
all
but
drowned
he
stood
up
white
and
magnificent
squeezing
the
water
from
his
beard
and
hair
as
he
commenced
to
climb
the
stair
in
the
he
vanished
she
could
go
now
her
curiosity
was
roused
what
kind
of
a
man
could
be
so
foolhardy
as
to
do
a
thing
like
that
drawing
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
tower
she
waited
whistling
faint
at
first
it
was
a
gay
little
neapolitan
air
singing
for
a
stave
or
two
it
broke
off
the
whistling
took
up
the
air
gulls
flew
up
circling
and
screaming
above
the
moldering
ramparts
red
and
gold
against
the
red
and
gold
of
the
sunset
came
the
valiant
head
of
a
man
who
might
have
been
the
last
of
the
pirates
his
eyes
shone
like
blue
fire
the
wind
was
in
his
beard
and
hair
when
he
had
lifted
himself
on
to
the
wall
he
stood
there
on
the
very
edge
looking
back
perilously
he
was
of
extraordinary
height
and
strength
the
teeth
through
which
he
whistled
were
strong
and
white
everything
about
him
was
powerful
his
hands
his
shoulders
his
courageous
face
he
seemed
a
survival
of
ancient
deity
a
who
thinking
himself
unobserved
had
landed
at
the
spot
where
centuries
ago
venus
had
been
worshiped
by
a
forgotten
world
he
looked
solitary
and
irresponsible
a
law
to
himself
because
of
his
size
and
the
remoteness
of
the
place
kay
was
filled
with
lonely
terror
he
walked
slowly
over
to
the
easel
in
the
broken
archway
he
was
and
his
shirt
was
collarless
and
turned
back
at
the
neck
still
whistling
he
picked
up
the
palette
pushed
his
thumb
through
it
glanced
across
his
shoulder
seaward
and
commenced
touching
in
streaks
of
color
he
worked
carelessly
yet
with
rapid
intensity
sometimes
he
left
ofif
whistling
stepped
back
from
the
canvas
his
head
on
one
side
and
surveyed
his
handiwork
the
light
was
failings
kay
prayed
that
he
had
finished
but
no
driven
to
desperation
she
thought
she
could
creep
by
him
harry
and
peter
would
be
getting
nervous
she
had
drawn
level
with
him
a
stone
turned
beneath
her
foot
his
head
twisted
sharply
she
commenced
to
run
glancing
back
she
saw
his
eyes
following
he
was
laying
down
his
brushes
and
palette
in
her
panic
she
had
chosen
the
wrong
direction
a
wall
rose
in
front
blocking
her
exit
he
was
coming
she
could
hear
his
bare
feet
overtaking
her
she
climbed
the
wall
below
lay
the
sea
now
orange
now
sullen
in
patches
there
was
no
way
of
escape
she
looked
down
the
space
made
her
dizzy
she
groped
with
her
hands
as
if
to
push
back
the
distance
she
felt
like
a
bird
with
its
wings
folded
falling
falling
everything
had
gone
black
for
a
moment
she
was
held
out
above
the
sea
her
flight
arrested
blue
eyes
bent
over
her
laughing
she
was
swung
back
she
found
herself
lying
on
the
turf
the
man
was
kneeling
beside
her
chafing
her
hands
and
forehead
her
faintness
left
her
as
she
gazed
up
at
him
he
smiled
and
said
something
in
an
unintelligible
language
she
sat
up
bewildered
trying
to
appear
brave
i
all
right
thank
you
go
a
little
english
girl
his
voice
was
deep
and
pleasant
she
surveyed
him
with
growing
confidence
how
concerned
and
gentle
he
was
for
so
large
a
creature
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
he
was
quick
to
take
her
hand
but
she
withdrew
it
from
him
really
all
right
it
was
only
dizziness
neptune
he
plucked
at
his
red
beard
and
planted
himself
in
front
of
her
his
eyes
twinkled
little
english
girl
why
do
you
call
me
that
you
came
out
of
the
sea
and
know
before
i
go
i
want
to
tell
you
i
was
awfully
afraid
you
get
drowned
do
you
always
swim
when
you
come
to
the
castle
neptune
placed
his
hands
on
her
slight
shoulders
they
were
large
and
masterful
hands
barbaric
with
vivid
smudges
of
the
colors
he
had
been
using
she
was
conscious
that
in
his
artist
way
he
was
looking
not
so
much
at
her
as
at
her
body
swim
to
the
castle
no
it
was
the
first
time
your
poet
byron
was
the
last
to
do
it
thought
i
try
just
for
sport
as
you
english
call
would
do
it
again
she
said
wisely
now
i
must
really
he
did
budge
from
her
path
she
waited
he
regarded
her
with
amusement
not
till
you
promised
to
let
me
paint
your
kay
was
astounded
and
yes
and
flattered
he
might
be
a
great
artist
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
important
but
she
was
more
frightened
than
flattered
he
looked
so
huge
standing
there
in
the
yellow
twilight
please
she
said
must
let
me
go
my
brother
waiting
for
me
and
he
be
he
made
no
sign
that
he
had
heard
but
gazed
down
at
her
intently
with
his
bare
arms
folded
she
hesitated
a
sob
rose
in
her
throat
why
should
you
want
to
paint
me
he
said
are
beautiful
what
is
beautiful
dies
but
i
i
make
it
last
for
then
in
a
gentler
voice
little
english
girl
if
i
do
paint
you
we
may
never
meet
it
was
the
way
in
which
he
said
it
the
thrilling
sadness
of
his
tone
she
felt
that
she
was
flushing
and
laughed
to
disguise
her
embarrassment
neptune
i
thanked
you
and
and
it
was
your
fault
that
we
met
and
is
it
rather
rude
of
you
to
prevent
me
from
he
spoke
deliberately
rude
you
adorable
too
good
to
die
i
want
to
make
you
live
forever
if
i
were
neptune
know
what
i
do
i
swim
off
with
you
her
words
came
quickly
she
was
afraid
of
what
he
might
say
or
do
promise
you
shall
paint
she
tried
to
pass
him
he
put
his
arm
before
her
as
a
barrier
his
eyes
flashed
down
on
her
gladly
and
gravely
the
english
promise
anything
they
shake
hands
on
it
is
that
not
so
she
slipped
her
small
hand
into
his
great
one
she
heard
a
footstep
behind
it
was
her
fisherman
who
had
at
last
come
in
search
of
her
she
nodded
to
let
him
know
that
she
was
coming
now
that
she
was
not
alone
she
lost
her
fear
of
the
giant
she
became
interested
in
him
she
almost
liked
him
will
you
paint
me
she
asked
against
the
sky
it
the
color
of
your
eyes
we
going
to
be
friends
is
it
so
he
stepped
aside
little
english
girl
as
she
passed
under
the
broken
archway
she
turned
and
waved
his
blue
eyes
still
followed
her
through
the
yellow
twilight
down
through
the
hunchback
town
she
went
its
streets
were
deformed
steeply
descending
scarcely
more
than
a
yard
wide
it
was
eloquent
with
memories
of
unrecorded
fights
in
which
a
handful
had
held
porto
venere
against
armies
beneath
its
roofs
it
was
already
night
before
little
shrines
in
the
walls
candles
glistened
with
gaudy
sashes
round
their
waists
bowed
their
heads
and
crossed
themselves
reverently
as
they
passed
in
crooked
doorways
mothers
sat
suckling
their
babies
madonnas
with
the
oval
faces
and
kind
eyes
that
raphael
loved
to
paint
to
them
the
mystery
of
love
was
divulged
many
of
them
no
older
than
kay
after
her
great
fear
she
was
strangely
elated
she
had
seen
admiration
in
a
man
eyes
should
you
want
to
paint
me
she
could
hear
his
deep
voice
replying
you
are
then
came
the
wistful
knowledge
of
life
brevity
is
beautiful
she
had
never
thought
of
that
that
she
and
harry
and
peter
and
all
this
world
which
was
hers
must
die
the
old
town
with
its
defaced
magnificence
its
battered
heraldry
its
generations
of
who
had
left
not
even
their
names
behind
them
everything
reminded
her
is
beautiful
she
was
consumed
with
a
desire
she
had
never
known
before
to
experience
the
rage
of
life
why
was
it
what
had
made
her
waken
was
it
contact
with
a
primitive
and
virile
personality
she
had
gained
a
new
understanding
of
manhood
would
harry
be
like
that
if
he
lived
as
though
it
were
a
thousand
years
ago
she
stepped
into
the
boat
curling
herself
in
the
prow
among
nets
where
she
would
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
sail
darkness
was
stealing
across
the
sky
a
monstrous
whose
wings
roofed
in
the
gulf
from
shore
to
shore
the
sail
began
to
bulge
the
boat
lay
over
on
its
side
outlines
of
wooded
hills
grew
vague
to
the
north
spezia
lay
a
blazing
jewel
at
the
of
anchored
lanterns
twinkled
faintly
she
trailed
her
hand
watching
how
the
water
ran
phosphorescent
through
her
fingers
a
crept
out
of
the
dusk
a
guitar
was
being
played
a
man
voice
and
a
girl
singing
they
faded
voluptuously
into
silence
you
are
her
young
heart
beat
flutteringly
had
others
thought
it
and
been
afraid
to
tell
her
she
leant
back
her
head
stars
gazed
down
on
her
approvingly
and
all
sounds
and
sights
were
touched
with
poetry
the
whole
of
life
before
her
peter
and
harry
waiting
so
much
of
youth
to
spend
so
many
choices
yet
only
one
choice
peter
a
voice
hailed
her
is
that
you
kay
so
soon
she
sat
up
san
terenzo
with
its
golden
eyes
on
the
crazy
quay
she
made
out
two
blurs
of
white
peter
it
kay
is
harry
with
you
before
the
boat
had
stopped
as
it
nosed
its
way
along
the
side
harry
leapt
in
last
it
his
voice
was
strained
and
impetuous
for
eight
months
he
had
waited
he
had
been
kept
waiting
an
extra
day
the
longest
of
them
all
she
whispered
i
told
him
nothing
you
have
come
harry
you
really
she
took
a
hand
of
each
as
they
helped
her
to
land
walking
back
to
the
villa
she
gave
them
laughing
glimpses
of
her
adventure
not
such
a
bad
day
work
he
going
to
make
me
live
forever
in
a
had
been
said
from
her
window
kay
had
seen
the
lights
blown
out
in
other
bedrooms
the
fringing
the
shore
had
been
in
darkness
for
two
hours
she
leant
out
gazing
across
the
bay
to
where
the
headland
of
lerici
curved
in
like
a
horn
life
that
was
what
she
thought
about
it
was
in
this
very
room
that
shelley
had
wakened
and
recognized
the
cowled
figure
of
his
soul
and
had
heard
it
question
thou
satisfied
it
was
the
same
question
that
she
asked
herself
a
knock
upon
the
door
she
started
from
the
window
and
looked
back
it
came
again
so
lightly
that
it
seemed
to
say
you
and
i
are
meant
to
hear
she
threw
a
wrapper
about
her
her
long
bright
hair
fell
shining
across
her
shoulders
it
might
be
peter
again
it
came
on
the
threshold
harry
was
standing
me
speak
to
she
hesitated
gave
me
no
chance
to
say
anything
am
i
to
stay
or
or
to
go
he
ought
to
go
she
knew
that
and
yet
can
wait
kay
though
you
send
me
away
i
shall
wait
forever
for
she
was
sorry
for
him
and
more
than
sorry
this
pleading
of
the
living
voice
was
different
so
different
from
the
pleading
of
letters
dimly
she
heard
within
herself
the
echo
of
his
clamor
stirring
harry
i
want
you
to
stay
but
to
stay
just
as
you
were
he
caught
his
breath
it
was
almost
as
though
he
laughed
in
the
darkness
was
always
as
it
is
now
you
did
know
it
began
that
first
day
when
i
fought
peter
showing
off
like
a
boy
so
if
it
to
be
as
it
was
always
he
looked
so
lonely
standing
there
he
ought
to
be
sad
with
her
it
hurt
they
always
been
glad
together
she
took
his
hands
tremblingly
and
be
be
the
boy
we
have
such
good
times
harry
we
three
together
do
be
my
anything
else
i
too
young
for
that
and
has
learnt
to
do
without
me
lorie
was
the
same
with
you
you
understand
so
harry
promise
me
that
you
wo
let
peter
know
wo
do
anything
to
make
him
know
or
to
make
him
he
put
his
arms
about
the
narrow
shoulders
stooping
his
head
she
leant
her
face
aside
sharply
on
my
lips
they
for
the
man
i
one
day
i
she
freed
herself
from
him
gently
of
us
can
in
the
days
that
followed
when
they
walked
and
swam
and
sailed
together
harry
recognized
what
kay
had
meant
when
she
said
that
peter
had
learnt
to
do
without
her
with
the
end
of
his
hope
of
cherry
all
his
affections
had
flown
homeward
and
had
concentrated
on
the
love
of
his
sister
it
seemed
as
though
he
made
an
effort
to
find
her
sufficient
for
his
heart
cravings
to
all
other
women
his
eyes
were
blind
the
thought
that
any
other
woman
should
come
into
his
life
seemed
never
to
occur
to
him
glory
she
wrote
to
him
as
harry
had
written
to
kay
with
conscientious
regularity
but
he
read
her
letters
aloud
obviously
without
editing
they
were
serious
letters
like
her
eyes
searching
and
quiet
with
a
hint
of
need
behind
them
and
with
bursts
of
fun
when
she
told
of
the
struggles
of
her
stepfather
and
grace
to
run
the
winged
thrust
both
genially
and
for
profit
and
the
man
who
lived
as
though
it
were
a
thousand
years
ago
a
week
after
kay
had
first
met
him
they
sailed
across
the
gulf
to
discover
him
they
found
him
in
the
castle
painting
the
little
english
girl
he
threw
down
his
brushes
and
came
toward
her
with
his
arms
extended
he
gathered
her
hands
together
into
his
own
and
bent
over
her
intently
with
his
eyes
of
blue
fire
thought
i
lost
my
that
was
all
so
long
as
harry
and
peter
were
present
he
was
no
more
than
a
shaggy
artist
a
little
a
little
shy
when
they
had
walked
off
to
explore
the
town
it
was
different
he
picked
her
up
as
though
she
were
a
child
and
sat
her
on
the
broken
wall
where
the
blue
sea
swept
behind
her
shoulders
and
the
white
clouds
raced
through
her
hair
for
a
while
he
was
utterly
silent
touching
in
sketches
of
her
testing
various
poses
the
smell
of
wild
thyme
mingled
with
that
of
flowers
fermenting
in
the
sunshine
from
far
below
the
wash
of
waves
rose
coolly
presently
he
spoke
stopped
a
long
while
away
every
day
i
been
here
watching
for
you
i
do
often
watch
for
anybody
if
people
come
he
snapped
his
fingers
begin
again
i
begin
with
someone
who
wo
keep
me
his
egotism
seemed
not
conceit
but
justified
consciousness
of
power
kay
was
beginning
to
explain
he
cut
in
upon
her
all
right
for
you
i
wait
till
oh
till
there
was
any
castle
till
it
was
all
swept
into
the
sea
by
rain
but
only
for
you
for
other
people
too
he
stopped
sketching
and
looked
up
at
her
english
girl
life
is
very
short
phew
he
blew
out
his
cheeks
that
and
you
are
old
all
the
lovers
are
gone
no
one
cares
whether
you
live
or
die
with
us
men
it
the
same
only
we
we
search
for
the
great
secret
you
have
it
in
your
face
there
so
much
to
do
it
not
kind
to
keep
us
great
secret
what
is
it
he
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
her
question
picking
up
his
pencil
he
went
back
to
his
sketching
then
while
he
worked
glancing
occasionally
to
her
face
where
the
radiance
of
the
sunshine
fell
against
her
profile
great
secret
it
hard
to
say
it
why
we
here
and
from
where
we
come
and
where
we
go
it
the
knowledge
of
life
and
the
meaning
of
death
it
everything
that
we
call
beauty
i
see
it
in
your
face

it

next
day
he
set
to
work
on
canvas
the
picture
grew
it
was
for
the
picture
that
kay
went
to
him
it
was
for
the
things
he
said
in
the
loneliness
lifted
high
between
the
waste
of
tossing
sea
and
restless
sky
he
set
her
thinking
he
made
life
more
glad
more
eager
and
because
of
its
mystery
more
poignant
the
great
secret
he
did
hope
to
find
it
but
he
told
her
of
the
men
who
had
sought
in
telling
her
he
brought
the
soul
into
her
eyes
and
set
it
down
on
canvas
a
young
girl
with
blowy
hair
perched
among
things
ancient
her
white
hands
folded
patient
for
the
future
with
the
pain
of
joy
in
her
wide
child
eyes
that
was
what
he
painted
and
she
she
was
stirred
by
him
he
gave
her
the
freedom
of
his
mind
he
treated
her
as
a
woman
teaching
her
knowledge
and
the
sorrow
of
knowledge
from
all
suspicion
of
which
she
had
been
guarded
she
was
as
much
repelled
as
attracted
by
him
through
him
she
learnt
to
love
harry
she
began
to
understand
the
suffering
of
love
that
is
kept
hungry
she
began
to
understand
its
urgency
at
last
she
understood
that
such
love
as
harry
brought
her
must
always
stand
first
sacrificing
every
other
affection
it
was
this
that
gave
pain
to
her
joy
one
day
in
early
june
the
man
laid
aside
his
brushes
last
touch
it
he
lifted
her
down
very
gently
and
watched
her
as
she
stood
before
it
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
she
gazed
at
her
own
reflection
with
an
odd
mixture
of
wonder
and
ecstacy
but
it
he
put
his
arm
about
her
shoulder
speaking
softly
so
are
not
so
i
could
paint
your
she
stretched
out
her
hands
toward
it

it
yours
i
did
it
for
you
you
know
now
how
you
looked
when
your
beauty

came
it
was
like
the
world
complaining
against
god
injustice
i
do
want

to
he
drew
her
head
against
him
what
an
english

little
kay
one
thing
will
keep
it
she
waited
great
secret
he
whispered
lies
behind
all
life
for
other
people
your
beauty
will
have
vanished
a
man
who
loves
you
will
always
see
before
she
was
aware
he
had
touched
her
lips
if
was
as
though
he
had
stained
her
purity
on
the
sail
back
to
san
terenzo
as
the
darkness
drew
about
them
she
crept
closer
to
harry
he
felt
her
hand
groping
for
his
own
you
burning
as
hot
as
a
coal
what
is
it
a
touch
of
fever
she
spoke
chokingly
my
lips

chapter
xlvi
the
angel
whistles
it
was
the
longest
day
in
june
the
room
was
stifling
filled
with
greenish
light
which
fell
in
stripes
through
the
slats
of
the
closed
shutters
on
the
tiled
floor
water
had
been
sprinkled
walls
were
stripped
bare
a
sheet
dipped
in
disinfectants
was
pinned
across
the
open
door
on
the
other
side
sat
the
nun
who
had
come
to
act
as
nurse
she
sympathized
with
the
jealousy
that
kept
them
always
at
the
bedside
and
only
intruded
when
she
was
sent
for
or
to
give
the
medicines
this
desperate
clinging
of
flesh
to
flesh
while
the
soul
was
outgrowing
the
body
how
often
she
had
watched
it
she
could
not
speak
their
language
did
understand
anything
but
the
quivering
tenderness
of
what
was
said
she
was
a
little
in
awe
of
these
two
young
englishmen
who
seemed
so
angry
with
god
and
who
sat
day
and
night
guarding
the
dying
girl
lest
in
an
unheeded
moment
god
should
snatch
her
from
them
reckless
of
contagion
they
bent
above
the
pillow
where
the
flushed
face
tossed
between
the
plaits
of
daffodil
hair
the
fight
was
unequal
it
could
last
much
longer
it
had
been
going
on
for
a
week
had
they
known
in
time
that
it
was
typhoid
by
the
time
they
knew
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
be
removed
the
had
none
of
the
necessities
of
nursing
the
doctor
had
to
come
from
spezia
someone
had
to
go
for
him
at
this
moment
she
had
had
a
relapse
harry
looked
at
peter
he
spoke
quietly
knowing
that
she
might
not
be
there
when
he
returned
peter
touched
kay
hand
attempting
the
cheerfulness
which
they
had
feigned
from
the
first
hoping
that
it
might
deceive
even
death
she
opened
her
eyes
she
had
gone
back
years
as
her
strength
had
failed
she
spoke
as
she
looked
like
a
slight
far
distant
from
womanhood
they
had
been
crowding
the
gentleness
of
a
full
life
into
the
words
exchanged
in
those
few
days
he
started
to
speak
choked
and
had
to
start
afresh
off
to
spezia
to
fetch
the
doctor
the
man
who
going
to
make
you
it
was
uttered
deliberately
with
a
wise
disbelieving
smile
harry
her
face
grew
troubled
as
she
tried
to
recollect
a
name
that
was
familiar
harry
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
went
on
his
knees
beside
her
pressing
her
hand
to
his
lips
do
you
know
me
your
boy
the
puzzled
look
melted
a
low
laugh
came
to
her
parched
lips
dear
dear
boy
at
the
door
he
gazed
back
longingly
peter
caught
him
by
the
arm
it
was
the
struggle
not
to
be
selfish
it
had
been
going
on
through
seven
days
stay
let
me
harry
shook
his
head
was
yours
before
she
was
he
slipped
out
his
footsteps
faded
down
the
stairs
in
the
house
there
was
no
sound
only
her
weary
sighing
everything
was
hushed
and
shuttered
outside
waves
dragged
against
the
sand
and
broke
in
long
sparkling
ripples
a
pulley
creaked
as
a
fisherman
hoisted
sail
across
the
bay
came
the
panting
of
the
steamer
from
lerici
it
drew
in
against
the
pier
boys
laughter
sounded
and
splashing
as
they
dived
for
money
again
the
panting
wandering
off
into
the
distance
it
rounded
the
headland
silence
so
much
of
life
in
the
world
and
none
to
spare
for
her
and
this
had
come
at
a
time
when
her
father
was
ill
so
that
neither
he
nor
her
mother
could
come
to
her
she
threw
back
the
sheet
which
was
spread
above
her
slender
body
her
hand
groped
out
peterkins
you
left
me
never
leave
you
and
when
you
better
again
the
incredulous
smile
he
could
get
no
further
her
voice
quite
near
to
him
reached
him
remotely
i
should
die
he
spoke
quickly
not
going
dearest
if
i
should
you
wo
be
bitter
wo
break
your
heart
about
me
if
you
did
i
should
know
i
should
be
happy
promise
that
you
still
trust
god
and
be
against
his
belief
he
promised
he
thought
her
sleeping
her
lips
moved
no
man
hath
seen
beloved
we
have
we
he
was
shaken
with
sobbing
he
had
to
wait
little
heart
been
god
to
me
and
and
to
my
hand
he
was
holding
it
so
tired
it
night
light
the
lamp
i
want
to
see
he
unlatched
the
shutters
across
the
dazzling
blue
of
the
gulf
the
sun
stared
luridly
swinging
low
above
the
her
brain
began
to
wander
she
spoke
unforgettable
things
unforgettable
in
their
tenderness
it
seemed
that
behind
the
confusion
of
her
words
her
spirit
was
preparing
him
it
was
as
though
she
turned
the
pages
of
memory
haphazard
chancing
on
phrases
which
summed
up
her
short
eighteen
years
of
existence
in
a
christmas
cab
there
was
what
he
had
called
the
laughter
of
birds
in
the
way
she
said
it
it
must
be
something
she
came
to
a
winter
when
she
had
nearly
died
when
peter
had
been
sent
for
hurriedly
from
sandport
peter
peter
she
wailed
his
name
childishly
then
as
though
she
snuggled
warmly
against
one
she
trusted
never
going
to
leave
me
i
shall
get
well
for
some
minutes
she
was
silent
of
a
sudden
she
sat
up
crying
do
want
to
be
a
i
do
want
to
be
a
it
all
came
back
his
boyish
attempt
to
explain
heaven
to
her
and
her
terror
because
there
was
no
means
of
escape
by
trains
or
trams
as
then
so
now
he
failed
to
console
her
she
sank
on
the
pillow
exhausted
by
her
panic
during
those
brief
minutes
while
the
sun
fell
lower
she
all
the
joys
and
bewilderments
which
had
been
their
childhood
now
they
were
playing
in
the
garden
at
topbury
now
riding
out
to
the
happy
cottage
on
the
tandem
trike
once
it
was
a
flowered
meadow
she
was
trying
to
whistle
his
startled
question
of
long
ago
went
unspoken
only
her
tearful
protest
gave
the
clue
to
her
wandering
never
heard
it
peter
truly
never
i
made
it
up
out
of
my
own
for
one
thing
which
she
said
he
had
no
picture
on
my
lips
for
the
man
i
he
buried
his
face
it
was
intolerable
god
i
ca
bear
love
and
marriage
she
spoke
of
them
she
would
never
know
them
lying
there
so
stilly
while
death
crept
through
her
body
she
seemed
uncannily
sensitive
to
all
that
happened
in
his
mind
she
knew
that
something
she
had
said
had
hurt
him
her
delirium
went
from
her
me
peter
like
you
used
to
i
be
afraid
he
leant
his
face
against
her
hair
his
cheek
touching
hers
she
lifted
her
hand
and
stroked
him
comfortingly
was
she
wandering
he
could
tell
her
eyes
were
wide
gazing
into
a
great
distance
heaven
they
are
all
all
feeling
him
touch
her
she
was
filled
with
a
wistful
regret
warm
flesh
and
she
tried
to
turn
her
head
he
raised
himself
over
her
it
seemed
that
her
sight
had
returned
he
forced
himself
to
smile
lest
she
should
take
fright
at
his
crying
heaven
they
are
all
all
he
listened
for
her
breath
with
unexpected
strength
she
fastened
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
drew
herself
up
she
was
staring
through
the
open
window
to
where
a
red
spark
smoldered
on
the
edge
of
the
a
sighing
of
wind
across
water
from
far
away
whistling
a
little
air
happy
and
haunting
trilled
over
and
over
it
was
like
a
shepherd
calling
her
lips
broke
into
a
smile
i
hear
she
drooped
against
his
breast
the
whistling
grew
fainter
the
red
spark
was
quenched
the
longest
day
was
ended
chapter
xlvii
virgins
had
no
and
they
that
could
swim
in
the
first
stabbing
sense
of
loss
he
hoped
that
he
had
caught
the
contagion
and
might
die
life
without
her
was
unthinkable
then
through
very
excess
of
grief
his
feelings
became
blunted
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
would
ever
again
fear
or
expect
he
moved
as
in
a
time
had
no
significance
days
slipped
by
uncounted
he
was
trying
to
understand
life
searching
behind
the
external
show
for
its
secret
meaning
and
purpose
up
till
now
with
the
gay
generosity
of
a
child
he
had
shared
himself
with
those
whom
he
loved
and
by
whom
he
was
loved
concentrating
and
intensifying
his
affections
now
dimly
at
first
he
began
to
view
existence
from
the
angle
of
responsibility
as
a
river
ever
broadening
and
growing
more
adventurous
pouring
down
from
forgotten
highlands
to
the
conjectured
sea
it
was
not
his
journey
that
counted
it
was
the
direction
and
journey
of
the
total
river
if
he
suffered
and
had
been
glad
there
were
multitudes
who
were
glad
and
had
suffered
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
this
alternating
sorrow
and
gladness
for
the
first
time
he
asked
himself
how
other
people
thought
felt
endured
people
like
jehane
and
riska
like
the
golden
woman
and
glory
a
month
ago
had
anyone
told
him
that
his
sister
would
be
taken
from
him
he
would
have
defied
god
by
turning
infidel
but
now
he
realized
reluctantly
how
his
very
passion
for
her
might
have
crippled
her
shutting
out
the
natural
and
fine
things
that
belong
to
every
man
and
woman
in
giving
her
too
much
he
might
have
deprived
her
of
what
was
most
splendid
giving
her
ultimate
curtailment
how
near
he
had
come
to
doing
this
he
had
learnt
from
harry
her
words
were
continually
recurring
in
his
memory
dragging
him
back
from
despondency
wo
be
bitter
wo
break
your
heart
about
me
if
you
did
i
should
know
i
should
be
the
shame
that
he
might
be
paining
her
was
always
with
him
he
had
the
sure
knowledge
that
though
he
could
not
see
her
she
still
lingered
in
the
house
sitting
with
closed
eyes
especially
at
twilight
he
believed
he
could
hear
her
moving
moving
gladly
the
sound
was
always
behind
him
even
when
he
turned
his
head
he
placed
flowers
about
her
room
pretending
she
was
alive
he
liked
to
picture
her
surprise
when
she
found
them
a
white
wraith
of
laughing
mist
he
imagined
he
saw
her
stoop
above
them
in
his
mind
he
heard
her
voice
peterkins
how
good
you
still
are
to
me
the
wind
touched
his
cheek
it
was
her
mouth
while
her
body
remained
in
the
house
his
grief
was
inconsolable
yet
peace
came
to
him
even
before
the
mortal
part
long
and
was
borne
through
the
village
to
the
garden
on
the
hill
gazing
out
to
sea
and
quiet
through
the
first
long
night
he
sat
beside
her
fixing
her
features
everything
that
had
been
her
indelibly
in
his
mind
the
swathed
feet
immobile
as
marble
beneath
the
tall
candles
brought
back
her
saying
joy
goes
into
my
feet
when
i
wearied
by
watching
he
slept
again
she
was
dying
he
could
hear
her
voice
trying
so
hard
to
be
patient
someone
entered
bringing
a
new
body
exactly
like
the
old
one
but
well
she
rose
and
slipped
into
it
just
as
if
she
were
trying
on
a
new
dress
she
caught
him
by
the
hand
laughing
excitedly
in
their
gladness
as
they
left
the
room
neither
of
them
remembered
to
look
back
to
the
bed
they
had
no
pity
for
the
abandoned
fleshly
garment
and
was
death
no
more
than
that
to
the
dead
clothes
cast
aside
outworn
by
the
spirit
what
a
little
to
make
a
fuss
about
through
the
open
window
dawn
was
breaking
in
a
chair
harry
slept
his
chin
fallen
forward
peter
rose
to
his
feet
and
tiptoed
over
to
the
still
face
lying
on
the
pillow
framed
in
the
golden
hair
he
stood
gazing
down
the
morning
wind
walked
the
sea
like
the
feet
of
jesus
bringing
peace
to
sinful
men
far
back
he
remembered
another
early
morning
when
kay
eyes
had
been
closed
and
he
had
heard
those
same
feet
walking
snow
had
lain
on
the
ground
another
girl
strangely
like
her
with
the
same
bowed
mouth
and
penciled
brows
had
been
stretched
beside
her
while
kay
eyes
were
shuttered
the
other
eyes
had
opened
as
the
days
went
by
the
desire
grew
strong
within
him
to
see
glory
he
wanted
to
trace
kay
likeness
in
the
living
features
and
yet
he
postponed
it
was
september
harry
had
left
for
london
called
back
by
work
letters
from
topbury
implored
his
own
return
he
was
afraid
to
abandon
scenes
familiar
in
losing
them
he
might
lose
the
sense
of
kay
spirit
presence
then
to
him
as
to
harry
came
the
imperative
cry
of
the
need
of
the
world
a
telegram
sent
from
paris
and
forwarded
on
from
topbury
reached
him
of
all
persons
it
was
from
the
golden
woman
it
bade
him
urgently
to
join
her
he
took
no
notice
another
saying
that
it
was
not
she
who
wanted
him
but
someone
whom
he
could
help
a
third
still
more
insistent
the
first
he
had
suspected
this
last
was
too
pleading
for
insincerity
he
packed
up
and
left
in
paris
she
met
him
even
then
she
refused
to
tell
him
why
she
had
sent
for
him
she
was
a
different
golden
woman
grave
and
quiet
the
day
after
his
arrival
she
took
him
out
to
a
gray
normandy
village
on
the
train
journey
she
had
little
to
say
only
once
did
she
explain
herself
a
flight
of
swallows
was
passing
over
a
meadow
going
south
moving
steadily
as
a
cloud
she
met
his
eyes
i
different
the
stork
knoweth
her
appointed
times
and
the
turtle
and
the
crane
and
the
swallow
but
you
remember
the
passage
i
did
know
mine
i
waited
too
long
foolish
foolish
the
winter
came
my
appointed
time
went
by
and
a
little
later
let
that
happen
to
you
they
walked
down
a
white
road
and
came
to
a
cottage
she
knocked
a
voice
which
he
ought
to
have
recognized
told
her
to
enter
sitting
in
a
low
chair
her
foot
rocking
a
cradle
was
riska
she
rose
overcome
with
surprise
lowering
her
face
awaiting
his
judgment
as
he
pressed
her
to
him
the
baby
began
to
cry
she
stooped
picked
him
up
and
held
him
out
to
peter
he
sweet
the
first
words
she
had
spoken
spoken
without
shame
or
apology
almost
with
pride
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
sin
which
had
made
a
thing
so
beautiful
could
need
excusing
he
met
her
eyes
reading
in
them
sacrifice
where
was
the
old
riska
impatient
of
restraint
eager
to
catch
men
with
the
petulant
fluttering
mouth
the
passion
which
should
have
destroyed
had
purified
just
as
his
grief
which
might
have
embittered
had
made
him
more
anxious
to
help
on
the
way
to
england
she
told
him
of
hardcastle
got
so
tired
of
trying
and
trying
to
get
married
all
the
men
found
out
something
father
or
my
shallowness
or
something
i
do
blame
them
and
all
the
time
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
mother
talked
about
the
raft
and
what
happened
if
a
girl
did
escape
from
it
i
grew
desperate
and
frightened
it
was
anything
to
catch
a
man
and
then
roy
he
said
he
marry
me
in
paris
afterwards
he
put
off
and
put
off
when
he
deserted
me
i
did
like
to
write
after
the
baby
came
i
do
know
it
may
be
all
wrong
but
i
was
a
bit
ashamed
of
myself
i
did
write
then
because
i
could
bear
to
think
of
people
despising
him
if
the
golden
woman
had
met
me
oh
well
i
should
have
gone
on
somehow
earning
money
for
baby
with
my
but
dear
peter
i
so
glad
you
found
me
i
never
understood
you
till
at
topbury
that
first
night
after
a
hurried
reference
to
kay
they
did
trust
themselves
to
talk
about
her
they
tortured
themselves
the
more
by
their
reticence
everything
spoke
so
loudly
of
her
absence
nan
sat
with
riska
child
in
her
arms
the
child
which
should
have
been
unwelcome
it
seemed
to
fill
a
gap
in
her
life
they
all
knew
what
was
passing
behind
her
eyes
the
evening
grew
late
she
and
riska
went
slowly
up
to
bed
peter
turned
to
his
father
for
hours
he
had
sat
grimly
watching
the
landscape
by
cuyp
where
the
comfortable
burgher
walked
forever
unperturbed
by
the
banks
of
the
gray
canal
not
doing
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
gesture
accused
god
defiantly
father
not
doing
right
one
of
the
last
things
she
said
was
that
she
know
and
be
unhappy
if
we
broke
our
hearts
about
her
she
does
know
and
and
i
think
we
been
making
her
for
a
long
time
his
father
sat
brooding
he
stretched
out
his
hand
imagination
peter
you
never
outgrown
it
but
but
we
want
to
make
her
the
house
was
hushed
it
was
some
hours
since
they
had
climbed
the
stairs
he
crept
out
of
his
room
into
the
one
that
had
been
hers
it
was
the
same
as
when
years
ago
they
two
had
shared
it
he
gazed
across
the
gulf
to
where
hampstead
lay
shrouded
beneath
the
night
and
he
remembered
the
moon
letting
down
her
silver
ladder
and
bidding
him
ascend
the
windows
in
streets
he
had
never
traversed
which
had
seemed
to
watch
him
like
the
eyes
of
cats
the
mysterious
whistling
from
the
coming
coming
he
tried
as
of
old
to
eliminate
barriers
by
the
magic
of
imagination
it
was
true
surely
and
he
had
grown
up
soon
he
would
hear
the
angel
whistle
on
the
straight
unruffled
bed
he
would
see
the
gentle
little
body
with
the
tumbled
hair
he
forgot
his
promise
not
to
break
his
heart
about
her
throwing
himself
down
he
knelt
beside
the
pillow
with
his
empty
arms
spread
out
a
sound
someone
was
holding
him
someone
who
coming
on
the
same
errand
had
discovered
him
peterkins
do
his
arms
went
about
her
neck
mother
it
long
since
you
called
me
that
i
so
tired
tired
of
pretending
to
be
brave
and
trying
to
be
a
they
sent
for
jehane
next
day
and
the
next
at
last
they
had
to
go
and
fetch
her
her
heart
was
hard
because
of
the
disgrace
of
what
had
happened
she
spoke
with
bitterness
of
her
children
glory
joining
her
stepfather
at
the
winged
thrush
she
construed
as
an
act
of
treachery
daughter
of
mine
she
said
in
a
she
had
given
up
all
hope
that
eustace
would
ever
ask
her
to
come
to
canada
his
infrequent
letters
had
given
her
to
understand
tacitly
that
she
was
not
wanted
only
moggs
was
left
a
subdued
child
a
little
like
glory
against
disappointment
from
that
quarter
jehane
forearmed
herself
by
taking
disappointment
for
granted
her
sense
of
injustice
centered
in
the
paradox
that
ocky
was
happy
despite
his
mismanagement
while
she
after
all
her
painstaking
rectitude
was
sad
throughout
the
journey
to
topbury
she
insisted
vigorously
that
she
would
never
take
riska
back
as
she
entered
the
hall
of
his
house
barrington
heard
the
last
repetition
of
her
assertion
do
want
you
to
he
said
and
her
child
are
going
to
live
with
then
jehane
saw
riska
and
recognized
the
change
promptly
she
turned
her
accusals
against
herself
she
had
been
unwise
she
had
spoilt
her
life
both
as
wife
and
mother
her
calamities
were
her
own
doing
she
needed
riska
wanted
her
come
with
your
mother
wo
you
riska
shook
her
head
gently
so
gently
that
for
a
minute
she
looked
like
glory
dear
i
ca
i
would
if
it
were
only
myself
i
baby
to
consider
you
do
for
him
just
what
you
done
you
help
it
i
going
to
stay
here
with
aunt
nan
and
learn
learn
to
be
like
her
like
jehane
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
a
bitter
woman
yes
and
jealous
but
that
my
own
child
should
tell
me
and
should
be
able
to
say
it
truly
she
looked
up
i
were
to
try
to
be
different
if
i
could
prove
to
you
that
i
was
different
riska
put
her
arms
about
her
mother
neck
all
in
the
future
but
oh
i
so
sorry
so
sorry
i
know
you
done
your
best
her
voice
was
full
of
well
she
had
lost
her
last
illusion
her
faith
in
her
own
righteousness
barrington
watching
the
disillusioned
woman
tried
to
trace
in
her
features
the
eager
face
of
dreamings
that
had
beckoned
to
him
from
a
window
on
a
summer
afternoon
in
oxford
he
found
no
resemblance
he
turned
to
riska
who
had
played
life
game
so
recklessly
plunging
off
the
raft
of
maidenhood
swimming
and
drifting
on
débris
to
the
land
of
maternity
about
which
her
mother
was
always
talking
in
searching
riska
face
he
found
jehane
dreamings
come
true
and
mastery
sacrifice
by
the
road
of
sin
had
accomplished
them
he
recollected
how
he
had
said
of
her
fruit
ready
to
fall
to
the
he
smiled
wisely
remembering
his
own
unwisdom
chapter
xlviii
and
glory
he
was
late
it
did
matter
no
one
had
been
warned
of
his
coming
he
punted
down
the
last
stretch
of
river
it
had
been
peterish
yet
appropriate
of
him
to
choose
this
means
of
travel
he
had
arrived
in
henley
that
morning
had
he
gone
by
road
he
could
have
been
at
the
winged
thrush
for
lunch
now
full
behind
him
spying
beneath
the
bent
arm
of
a
willow
stooped
the
setting
sun
all
day
he
had
had
the
sense
of
things
watching
memories
associations
of
the
past
hopes
and
dreads
which
had
lost
their
power
to
help
or
harm
him
a
new
hope
had
become
his
companion
he
gazed
back
taking
a
farewell
glance
at
the
old
affections
as
he
stole
down
the
streak
of
silver
through
autumn
meadows
he
had
many
thoughts
cherry
and
the
last
time
he
had
made
that
journey
the
faun
man
and
himself
the
way
in
which
men
mistake
their
love
withered
reeds
rustled
with
the
motion
of
his
passing
fallen
leaves
scarlet
and
brown
and
yellow
starred
the
water
surface
thrusting
himself
forward
he
sang
and
hummed
been
shipwrecked
off
patagonia
home
and
colonia
he
broke
off
smiling
whimsically
in
a
figurative
sense
his
own
autobiography
almost
a
fulfilled
prophecy
a
brave
song
he
liked
it
it
paid
no
heed
to
regret
and
recorded
only
the
joy
of
pressing
on
letting
the
punt
drift
he
stared
back
into
the
evening
redness
it
took
courage
to
learn
what
things
to
remember
and
how
to
forget
for
some
weeks
he
had
been
trying
to
learn
this
was
the
testing
he
rounded
a
bend
ahead
swans
sailed
placidly
cattle
stood
in
water
in
the
stream
tethered
to
a
landing
boats
swung
idly
on
a
lawn
green
tables
were
set
out
in
the
shadow
of
trees
everything
stood
hushed
and
huddled
in
the
gilded
quiet
he
stepped
out
and
strolled
up
through
the
trellised
garden
finding
no
one
he
wandered
round
the
inn
to
the
back
from
the
came
the
splashing
that
water
makes
when
a
brush
is
plunged
into
a
bucket
then
a
droning
sound
punctuated
with
the
hissing
of
an
ostler
peter
laughed
inwardly
there

tremble
in

question
and
glanced

sharply

he
passed
his
hand
in
front
of
his
mouth
glory
she
lonely
for
a
bit
of
a
gel
with
two
old
codgers

peter
waved
his
hand
and
passed
out
of
grace
winked
his
eye
at
the
horse
beg
parding
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
trees
the
moon
was
rising
a
little
breeze
shook
the
brittle
leaves
laughing
softly
among
them
as
they
broke
from
their
anchorage
and
swooped
like
bats
through
the
dusk
on
the
edge
of
the
lawn
overhanging
the
river
a
white
post
stood
ghostly
as
he
untied
his
punt
peter
looked
up
and
read
the
legend
winged
on
the
sign
was
depicted
a
brown
bird
fluttering
its
wings
in
a
gilded
cage
he
pushed
off
into
the
stream
creeping
between
misty
banks
through
the
twilight
glory
until
the
last
few
months
his
world
had
consisted
of
other
people
people
who
had
seemed
so
important
and
glory
but
now
now
that
he
could
no
longer
follow
the
shining
head
of
his
little
sister
he
had
halted
looking
back
all
through
the
years
from
childhood
he
seemed
to
hear
glory
tiptoeing
behind
him
he
had
noticed
her
so
rarely
he
remembered
the
time
when
he
had
told
her
to
remain
seated
on
the
garden
wall
had
forgotten
her
had
missed
her
and
had
recollected
her
only
to
find
her
still
waiting
for
him
crying
in
the
darkness
the
terror
seized
him
that
he
might
have
remembered
too
late
might
have
lost
her
something
tapped
against
the
side
of
his
punt
he
leant
out
a
floating
oar
the
stream
was
beginning
to
quicken
ahead
rose
the
low
booming
of
water
rushing
across
a
weir
he
gazed
about
him
down
the
shadowy
river
darkly
in
moonlight
a
black
thing
like
a
log
bobbed
in
the
current
as
he
came
up
with
it
a
figure
huddled
in
the
stern
called
nervously
to
him
please
i
dropped
my
oars
do
help
he
maneuvered
alongside
peter
dear
peter
there
was
no
time
for
talking
from
bank
to
bank
ahead
of
them
the
stream
leapt
palely
like
the
white
mane
of
a
plunging
horse
putting
his
arm
about
her
he
lifted
her
rapidly
into
his
punt
the
empty
boat
hurried
on
into
the
darkness
working
his
way
upstream
he
ran
into
safety
in
a
bed
of
rushes
if
i
lost
you
she
shook
her
head
laughing
he
knelt
beside
her
clasping
her
hands
how
what
were
you
doing
just
wondering
while
i
drifted
they
slipped
from
the
he
stooped
his
face
what
of
whom
her
voice
sank
i
tell
from
his
the
man
in
the
moon
drew
aside
the
curtain
he
peered
out
knowingly
peter
had
her
in
his
arms
his
lips
touched
hers
in
the
dusk
his
eyes
met
hers
kay
eyes
even
in
the
darkness
he
knew
them
you
do
care
you
really
want
me
she
drooped
her
head
against
his
shoulder
dearest
i
always
wanted
but
i
a
girl
peter
i
did
dare
the
end
