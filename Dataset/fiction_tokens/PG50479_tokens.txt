wine

but
a

and
this
book
is
just
such
a
collection
some
of
the
stories
i
do
not
want
to
remain
buried
for
ever
in
the
museum
files

an
author

title
of
a
volume
of
short
stories
is
always
a
difficult
matter
it
ought
to
indicate
frankly
the
nature
of
the
book
so
that
the
unwary
purchaser
shall
have
no
grievance
except
on
the
score
of
merit
which
is
a
different
affair
altogether
against
either
author
or
publisher
in
my
title
i
have
tried
to
solve
the
problem
but
why
well
the
stories
cover
a
long
stretch
of
years
and
all
save
one
were
written
in
calm
days
from
the
present
convulsion
of
the
no
one
will
buy
the
book
under
the
impression
that
it
is
a
novel
and
finding
that
it
is
revile
me
as
a
cheat
and
so
i
have
the
pleasure
of
offering
it
for
your
perusal
with
a
clear
dear
sir

madam
have
given
me
this
many
a
year
an
indulgence
beyond
my
deserts
till
now
i
have
had
no
opportunity
of
thanking
you
i
do
now
with
a
grateful
heart
and
to
you
i
dedicate
the
two
stories
that
i
love
the
best
hoping
that
they
may
excuse
those
for
which
you
may
not
so
much
care
and
that
they
may
win
continuance
of
that
which
is
to
me
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
human

cherished

it
is
also
not
everybody
good
fortune
to
go
to
peckham
still
less
to
live
there
but
if
you
were
one
of
the
favoured
few
and
were
wont
to
haunt
the
peckham
road
and
high
street
the
bent
figure
of
angelo
fardetti
would
have
been
as
familiar
to
you
as
the
vast
frontage
of
the
great
emporium
which
in
the
drapery
world
makes
peckham
illustrious
among
london
suburbs
you
would
have
seen
him
humbly
threading
his
way
through
the
female
swarms
that
clustered
at
the
windows
the
mere
drones
of
the
hive
were
fooling
their
frivolous
lives
away
over
ledgers
in
the
city
the
inquiry
of
a
lost
dog
in
his
patient
eyes
and
an
unconscious
challenge
to
philistia
in
the
wiry
bush
of
white
hair
that
protruded
beneath
his
perky
soft
felt
hat
if
he
had
been
short
he
might
have
passed
unregarded
but
he
was
very
tall
in
his
heyday
he
had
been
six
foot
two
and
very
thin
you
smile
as
you
recall
to
mind
the
black
somewhat
white
at
the
seams
which
tightly
buttoned
had
the
fit
of
a
garment
of
corrugated
iron
although
he
was
so
tall
one
never
noticed
the
inconsiderable
stretch
of
trouser
below
the
long
skirt
he
always
appeared
to
be
wearing
a
truncated
cassock
you
were
inclined
to
laugh
at
this
queer
exotic
of
the
peckham
road
until
you
looked
more
keenly
at
the
man
himself
then
you
saw
an
old
old
face
very
swarthy
very
lined
very
beautiful
still
in
its
regularity
of
feature
maintaining
in
a
little
white
moustache
with
waxed
ends
a
pathetic
braggadocio
of
youth
a
face
in
which
the
sorrows
of
the
world
seemed
to
have
their
dwelling
but
sorrows
that
on
their
way
thither
had
passed
through
the
crucible
of
a
simple
soul
twice
a
day
it
was
his
habit
to
walk
there
shops
and
faces
a
meaningless
confusion
to
his
eyes
but
his
ears
alert
to
the
many
harmonies
of
the
orchestra
of
the
great
thoroughfare
for
angelo
fardetti
was
a
musician
such
had
he
been
born
such
had
he
lived
those
aspects
of
life
which
could
not
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
music
were
to
him
unintelligible
during
his
seventy
years
empires
had
crumbled
mighty
kingdoms
had
arisen
bloody
wars
had
been
fought
magic
conquests
been
made
by
man
over
nature
but
none
of
these
convulsive
facts
had
ever
stirred
angelo
fardetti
imagination
even
his
country
he
had
forgotten
it
was
so
many
years
since
he
had
left
it
so
much
music
had
passed
since
then
through
his
being
yet
he
had
never
learned
to
speak
english
correctly
and
not
having
an
adequate
language
save
music
in
which
to
clothe
his
thoughts
he
spoke
very
little
when
addressed
he
smiled
at
you
sweetly
like
a
pleasant
inarticulate
old
child
though
his
figure
was
so
familiar
to
the
inhabitants
of
peckham
few
knew
how
and
where
he
lived
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
lived
a
few
hundred
yards
away
from
the
busy
high
street
in
formosa
terrace
at
the
house
of
one
anton
kirilov
a
musician
he
had
lodged
with
the
kirilovs
for
over
twenty
years
but
not
always
in
the
roomy
splendour
of
formosa
terrace
once
angelo
was
first
violin
in
an
important
orchestra
a
man
of
mark
while
anton
fiddled
away
in
the
obscurity
of
a
then
the
famous
violinist
rented
the
floor
of
the
kirilovs
little
house
in
clapham
while
the
kirilovs
humble
folk
got
on
as
best
they
could
now
things
had
changed
anton
kirilov
was
musical
director
of
a
london
theatre
but
angelo
through
age
and
rheumatism
and
other
infirmities
could
fiddle
in
public
no
more
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
anton
kirilov
and
olga
his
wife
and
sonia
their
daughter
to
whom
angelo
had
stood
godfather
twenty
years
ago
rioted
in
spaciousness
while
the
old
man
lodged
in
tiny
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
house
paying
an
infinitesimal
rent
and
otherwise
living
on
his
scanty
savings
and
such
few
shillings
as
he
could
earn
by
copying
out
parts
and
giving
lessons
to
here
and
there
a
little
girl
in
a
tradesman
back
parlour
often
he
might
have
gone
without
sufficient
nourishment
had
not
kirilov
seen
to
it
and
whenever
an
extra
good
dish
succulent
and
strong
appeared
at
her
table
either
sonia
or
the
servant
carried
a
plateful
upstairs
with
homely
compliments
you
are
making
of
me
a
spoiled
child
olga
he
would
say
sometimes
and
i
ought
not
to
eat
of
the
food
for
which
anton
works
so
hard
and
she
would
reply
with
a
laugh
if
we
did
not
keep
you
alive
signor
fardetti
how
should
we
have
our
quatuors
on
sunday
afternoons
you
see
kirilov
like
the
good
anton
had
lived
all
her
life
in
music
too
she
was
a
pianist
and
sonia
also
was
a
musician
she
played
the
in
a
ladies
orchestra
so
they
had
famous
sunday
quatuors
at
formosa
terrace
in
which
fardetti
was
well
content
to
play
second
fiddle
to
anton
first
you
see
also
that
but
for
these
honest
souls
to
whom
a
musician
like
fardetti
was
a
sort
of
the
evening
of
the
old
man
days
might
have
been
one
of
tragic
sadness
but
even
their
affection
and
his
glad
pride
in
the
brilliant
success
of
his
old
pupil
geoffrey
chase
could
not
mitigate
the
one
great
sorrow
of
his
life
the
violin
yes
he
had
played
it
well
he
had
not
aimed
at
a
great
soloist
fame
for
want
of
early
training
and
he
had
never
dreamed
such
unrealisable
dreams
but
other
dreams
had
he
dreamed
with
passionate
intensity
he
had
dreamed
of
being
a
great
composer
and
he
had
beaten
his
heart
out
against
the
bars
that
shut
him
from
the
great
mystery
a
waltz
or
two
a
few
songs
a
catchy
march
had
been
published
and
performed
and
had
brought
him
unprized
money
and
a
little
hateful
repute
but
the
compositions
into
which
he
had
poured
his
soul
remained
in
dusty
manuscript
despised
and
rejected
of
musical
men
for
many
years
the
artist
imperious
craving
to
create
and
hope
and
will
kept
him
serene
then
in
the
prime
of
his
days
a
tremendous
inspiration
shook
him
he
had
a
divine
message
to
proclaim
to
the
world
a
song
of
life
itself
a
revelation
it
was
life
indestructible
eternal
it
was
the
seed
that
grew
into
the
tree
the
tree
that
flourished
lustily
and
then
grew
bare
and
stark
and
perished
the
seed
again
of
the
tree
that
rose
unconquerable
into
the
laughing
leaf
of
spring
it
was
the
kiss
of
lovers
that
when
they
were
dead
and
gone
lived
immortal
on
the
lips
of
grandchildren
it
was
the
endless
roll
of
the
seasons
the
majestic
triumphant
rhythm
of
existence
it
was
a
cosmic
chant
telling
of
things
as
only
music
could
tell
of
them
and
as
no
musician
had
ever
told
of
them
before
he
attempted
the
impossible
you
will
say
he
did
that
was
the
pity
of
it
he
spent
the
last
drop
of
his
heart
blood
over
his
sonata
he
wrote
it
and
rewrote
it
wasting
years
but
never
could
he
imprison
within
those
remorseless
ruled
lines
the
elusive
sounds
that
shook
his
being
an
approximation
to
his
dream
reached
the
stage
of
a
completed
score
but
he
knew
that
it
was
thin
and
lifeless
the
themes
that
were
to
be
developed
into
magic
harmonies
tinkled
into
commonplace
the
shell
of
this
vast
conception
was
there
but
the
shell
alone
the
thing
could
not
live
without
the
unseizable
and
that
he
had
not
seized
angelo
fardetti
broken
down
by
toil
and
misery
fell
very
sick
doctors
recommended
brighton
docile
as
a
child
he
went
to
brighton
and
there
a
pretty
lady
who
admired
his
playing
at
the
monday
popular
concerts
at
james
hall
got
hold
of
him
and
married
him
when
she
ran
away
a
year
later
with
a
dashing
young
stockbroker
he
took
the
score
of
the
sonata
that
was
to
be
the
whole
interpretation
of
life
from
its
played
it
through
on
the
piano
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
in
the
uncontrollable
italian
way
sold
up
his
house
and
went
to
lodge
with
anton
kirilov
to
no
son
or
daughter
of
man
did
he
ever
show
a
note
or
play
a
bar
of
the
sonata
and
never
again
did
he
write
a
line
of
music
bravely
and
humbly
he
faced
life
though
the
tragedy
of
failure
made
him
prematurely
old
and
all
through
the
years
the
sublime
message
reverberated
in
his
soul
and
haunted
his
dreams
and
his
was
the
bitter
sorrow
of
knowing
that
never
should
that
message
be
delivered
for
the
comforting
of
the
world
the
loss
of
his
position
as
first
violin
forced
him
at
sixty
to
take
more
obscure
engagements
that
was
when
he
followed
the
kirilovs
to
peckham
and
then
he
met
the
joy
of
his
old
age
his
one
pupil
of
genius
geoffrey
chase
an
untrained
lad
of
fourteen
the
son
of
a
seed
merchant
in
the
high
street
his
father
thinks
it
waste
of
time
said
chase
a
gentle
woman
when
she
brought
the
boy
to
him
but
geoffrey
is
so
set
on
it
and
so
i
persuaded
his
father
to
let
him
have
lessons
do
you
too
love
music
he
asked
her
eyes
grew
moist
and
she
nodded
poor
lady
he
should
not
let
you
starve
never
mind
he
said
patting
her
shoulder
take
comfort
i
will
teach
your
boy
to
play
for
you
and
he
did
he
taught
him
for
three
years
he
taught
him
passionately
all
he
knew
for
geoffrey
with
music
in
his
blood
had
the
great
gift
of
the
composer
he
poured
upon
the
boy
all
the
love
of
his
lonely
old
heart
and
dreamed
glorious
dreams
of
his
future
the
kirilovs
too
regarded
geoffrey
as
a
prodigy
and
welcomed
him
into
their
circle
and
made
much
of
him
and
little
sonia
fell
in
love
with
him
and
he
in
his
boyish
way
fell
in
love
with
the
maiden
who
played
on
a
so
much
bigger
than
herself
at
last
the
time
came
when
angelo
said
my
son
i
can
teach
you
no
more
you
must
go
to
milan
my
father
will
never
consent
said
geoffrey
we
will
try
to
arrange
that
said
angelo
so
in
their
simple
ways
angelo
and
chase
intrigued
together
until
they
prevailed
upon
chase
to
attend
one
of
the
sunday
concerts
he
came
in
clothes
and
sat
with
irreconcilable
stiffness
on
a
chair
his
wife
sat
close
by
much
agitated
the
others
played
a
concerto
arranged
as
a
quintette
geoffrey
first
violin
angelo
second
sonia
anton
bass
and
kirilov
at
the
piano
it
was
a
piece
of
exquisite
tenderness
and
beauty
very
pretty
said
chase
it
beautiful
cried
his
wife
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
said
so
remarked
chase
and
what
do
you
think
of
my
pupil
angelo
asked
excitedly
i
think
he
plays
very
nicely
chase
admitted
but
dear
heavens
cried
angelo
it
is
not
his
playing
one
could
pick
up
fifty
better
violinists
in
the
street
it
is
the
concerto
the
composition
chase
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
geoffrey
made
up
all
that
himself
of
course
did
you
know
will
you
play
it
again
gladly
they
assented
when
it
was
over
he
took
angelo
out
into
the
passage
i
not
one
of
those
people
who
do
believe
in
art
fardetti
said
he
and
geoff
has
already
shown
me
that
he
sell
seeds
for
toffee
but
if
he
takes
up
music
will
he
be
able
to
earn
his
living
at
it
beyond
doubt
replied
angelo
with
a
wide
gesture
but
a
good
living
you
forgive
me
being
personal
fardetti
but
you
yourself
i
said
the
old
man
humbly
am
only
a
poor
fiddler
but
your
son
is
a
great
musical
genius
i
think
over
it
said
chase
chase
thought
over
it
and
geoffrey
went
to
milan
and
angelo
fardetti
was
once
more
left
desolate
on
the
day
of
the
departure
he
and
sonia
wept
a
little
in
each
other
arms
and
late
that
night
he
once
more
unearthed
the
completed
score
of
his
sonata
and
scanned
it
through
in
vain
hope
of
comfort
but
as
the
months
passed
comfort
came
his
beloved
swan
was
not
a
goose
but
a
wonder
among
swans
he
was
a
wonder
at
the
milan
conservatoire
and
won
prize
after
prize
and
medal
after
medal
and
every
time
he
came
home
he
bore
his
blushing
honours
thicker
upon
him
and
he
remained
the
same
frank
simple
youth
always
filled
with
gratitude
and
reverence
for
his
old
master
and
though
on
familiar
student
terms
with
all
conditions
of
cosmopolitan
damsels
never
faithless
to
the
little
maiden
whom
he
had
left
at
home
in
the
course
of
time
his
studies
were
over
and
he
returned
to
england
a
professorship
at
the
royal
school
of
music
very
soon
rendered
him
financially
independent
he
began
to
create
here
and
there
a
piece
of
his
was
played
at
concerts
he
wrote
incidental
music
for
solemn
productions
at
great
london
theatres
critics
discovered
him
and
wrote
much
about
him
in
the
newspapers
chase
the
seed
merchant
though
professing
to
his
wife
a
indifference
to
notoriety
used
surreptitiously
to
cut
out
the
notices
and
carry
them
about
in
his
fat
and
whenever
he
had
a
new
one
he
would
lie
in
wait
for
the
lean
figure
of
angelo
fardetti
and
hale
him
into
the
shop
and
make
him
drink
geoffrey
health
in
sloe
gin
which
angelo
abhorred
but
gulped
down
in
honour
of
the
prodigy
one
fine
october
morning
angelo
fardetti
missed
his
walk
he
sat
instead
by
his
window
and
looked
unseeingly
at
the
prim
row
of
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
formosa
terrace
he
had
not
the
heart
to
go
out
and
indeed
he
had
not
the
money
for
these
walks
twice
daily
along
the
high
street
and
the
peckham
road
took
him
to
and
from
a
queer
little
italian
restaurant
which
with
him
apparently
as
its
only
client
had
eked
out
for
years
a
mysterious
and
precarious
existence
he
felt
very
old
he
was
very
useless
very
poor
he
had
lost
his
last
pupil
a
fat
unintelligent
girl
of
thirteen
the
daughter
of
a
local
chemist
and
no
one
had
sent
him
any
copying
work
for
a
week
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
could
not
even
walk
to
his
usual
sparrow
meal
it
is
sad
when
you
are
so
old
that
you
can
not
earn
the
right
to
live
in
a
world
which
wants
you
no
longer
looking
at
unseen
bricks
through
a
small
was
little
consolation
mechanically
he
rose
and
went
to
a
grand
piano
his
one
possession
of
price
which
with
an
old
horsehair
sofa
an
oval
table
covered
with
a
maroon
cloth
and
a
chair
or
two
congested
the
tiny
room
and
sitting
down
began
to
play
one
of
stephen
heller
you
see
angelo
fardetti
was
an
musician
suddenly
a
phrase
arrested
him
he
stopped
dead
and
remained
staring
out
over
the
polished
plane
of
the
piano
for
a
few
moments
he
was
lost
in
the
chain
of
associated
musical
ideas
then
suddenly
his
swarthy
lined
face
lit
up
and
he
twirled
his
little
white
moustache
and
began
to
improvise
striking
great
majestic
chords
presently
he
rose
and
from
a
pile
of
loose
music
in
a
corner
drew
a
sheet
of
ruled
paper
he
returned
to
the
piano
and
began
feverishly
to
pencil
down
his
inspiration
his
pulses
throbbed
at
last
he
had
got
the
great
andante
movement
of
his
sonata
for
an
hour
he
worked
intensely
then
came
the
inevitable
check
nothing
more
would
come
he
rose
and
walked
about
the
room
his
head
swimming
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
played
over
what
he
had
written
and
then
with
a
groan
of
despair
fell
forward
his
arms
on
the
keys
his
bushy
white
head
on
his
arms
the
door
opened
and
sonia
comely
and
shapely
entered
the
room
carrying
a
tray
with
food
and
drink
set
out
on
a
white
cloth
seeing
him
bowed
over
the
piano
she
put
the
tray
on
the
table
and
advanced
dear
godfather
she
said
gently
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
raised
his
head
and
smiled
i
did
not
hear
you
my
little
sonia
you
have
been
composing
he
sat
upright
and
tore
the
pencilled
sheets
into
fragments
which
he
dropped
in
a
handful
on
the
floor
once
long
ago
i
had
a
dream
i
lost
it
i
thought
that
i
had
found
it
but
do
you
know
what
i
did
really
find
no
godfather
replied
sonia
stooping
with
housewifely
tidiness
to
pick
up
the
litter
that
i
am
a
poor
old
fool
said
he
sonia
threw
the
paper
into
the
grate
and
again
came
up
behind
him
it
is
better
to
have
lost
a
dream
than
never
to
have
had
one
at
all
what
was
your
dream
i
thought
i
could
write
the
song
of
life
as
i
heard
it
as
i
hear
it
still
he
smote
his
forehead
lightly
but
no
god
has
not
considered
me
worthy
to
sing
it
i
bow
my
head
to
his
to
his
he
sought
for
the
word
with
thin
fingers
to
his
decree
she
said
with
the
indulgent
wisdom
of
youth
speaking
to
age
he
has
given
you
the
power
to
love
and
to
win
love
the
old
man
swung
round
on
the
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
smiled
into
her
young
face
geoffrey
is
a
very
fortunate
fellow
because
he
a
successful
composer
he
looked
at
her
and
shook
his
head
and
sonia
knowing
what
he
meant
blushed
very
prettily
then
she
laughed
and
broke
away
mother
has
had
seventeen
partridges
sent
her
as
presents
this
week
and
she
wants
you
to
help
her
eat
them
and
father
offered
a
bargain
in
some
good
beaujolais
and
wo
decide
until
you
tell
him
what
you
think
of
it
deftly
she
set
out
the
meal
and
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
angelo
fardetti
rose
that
i
should
love
you
all
said
he
simply
is
only
human
but
that
you
should
so
much
love
me
is
more
than
i
can
understand
you
see
he
knew
that
watchful
ears
had
missed
his
usual
outgoing
footsteps
and
that
watchful
hearts
had
divined
the
reason
to
refuse
to
hesitate
would
be
to
reject
love
so
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
he
sat
down
meekly
and
sonia
ministered
to
his
wants
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
he
was
making
headway
with
the
partridge
and
the
burgundy
she
too
sat
by
the
table
godfather
she
said
i
had
splendid
news
this
morning
geoffrey
of
course
what
other
news
could
be
splendid
his
symphony
in
e
flat
is
going
to
be
given
at
the
queen
hall
that
is
indeed
beautiful
news
said
the
old
man
laying
down
knife
and
fork
but
i
did
not
know
that
he
had
written
a
symphony
in
e
flat
that
was
why
he
went
and
buried
himself
for
months
in
cornwall
to
finish
it
she
explained
i
knew
nothing
about
it
aie
aie
he
sighed
it
is
to
you
and
no
longer
to
me
that
he
tells
things
you
silly
jealous
old
dear
she
laughed
he
to
account
for
deserting
me
all
the
summer
but
as
to
what
it
all
about
i
as
ignorant
as
you
are
i
not
heard
a
note
of
it
sometimes
geoff
is
like
that
you
know
if
he
dead
certain
sure
of
himself
he
have
any
criticism
or
opinions
while
the
work
in
progress
it
only
when
he
doubtful
that
he
brings
one
in
and
the
doubtful
things
are
never
anything
like
the
certain
ones
you
must
have
noticed
it
that
is
true
said
angelo
fardetti
taking
up
knife
and
fork
again
he
was
like
that
since
he
was
a
boy
it
is
going
to
be
given
on
saturday
fortnight
he
conduct
himself
they
got
a
splendid
programme
to
send
him
off
lembrich
going
to
play
and
carli
going
to
sing
just
for
his
sake
is
it
gorgeous
it
is
grand
but
what
does
geoffrey
say
about
it
come
come
after
all
he
is
not
the
sphinx
he
drummed
his
fingers
impatiently
on
the
table
would
you
really
like
to
know
i
am
waiting
he
says
it
going
to
knock
she
laughed
knock
those
were
his
words
but
she
interpreted
into
purer
english
geoffrey
was
confident
that
his
symphony
would
achieve
a
sensational
success
in
the
meanwhile
said
she
if
you
do
finish
your
partridge
you
break
mother
heart
she
poured
out
a
glass
of
burgundy
which
the
old
man
drank
but
he
refused
the
food
no
no
he
said
i
can
not
eat
more
i
have
a
lump
there
in
my
throat
i
am
too
excited
i
feel
that
he
is
marching
to
his
great
triumph
my
little
geoffrey
he
rose
knocking
his
chair
over
and
strode
about
the
confined
space
but
i
am
a
wicked
old
man
i
was
sorrowful
because
i
was
so
dull
so
stupid
that
i
could
not
write
a
sonata
i
blamed
the
good
god
maxima
and
at
once
he
sends
me
a
partridge
in
a
halo
of
love
and
the
news
of
my
dear
son
glory
sonia
stopped
him
her
plump
hands
on
the
front
of
his
old
corrugated
and
your
glory
too
dear
godfather
if
it
had
been
for
you
where
would
geoffrey
be
and
who
realises
it
more
than
geoffrey
would
you
like
to
see
a
bit
of
his
letter
only
a
little
bit
for
there
a
lot
of
rubbish
in
it
that
i
would
be
ashamed
of
anybody
who
thinks
well
of
him
to
read
but
just
a
little
bit
her
hand
was
at
the
broad
belt
joining
blouse
and
skirt
angelo
towering
above
her
smiled
with
an
old
man
tenderness
at
the
laughing
love
in
her
dark
eyes
and
at
the
happiness
in
her
young
comely
face
her
features
were
generous
and
her
mouth
frankly
large
but
her
lips
were
fresh
and
her
teeth
white
and
even
and
to
the
old
fellow
she
looked
all
that
man
could
dream
of
the
virginal
of
great
sons
she
fished
the
letter
from
her
belt
scanned
and
folded
it
carefully
there
read
and
angelo
fardetti
read
i
learned
my
theory
and
technique
and
god
knows
what
things
that
only
they
could
teach
me
from
professors
with
names
but
for
real
inspiration
for
the
fount
of
music
itself
i
come
back
all
the
time
to
our
dear
old
angelo
fardetti
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
define
what
it
is
but
he
opened
for
me
a
secret
chamber
behind
whose
concealed
door
all
these
illustrious
chaps
have
walked
unsuspectingly
it
seems
silly
to
say
it
because
beyond
a
few
odds
and
ends
the
dear
old
man
has
composed
nothing
but
i
am
convinced
that
i
owe
the
essentials
of
everything
i
do
in
music
to
his
teaching
and
influence
angelo
gave
her
back
the
folded
letter
without
a
word
and
turned
and
stood
again
by
the
window
staring
unseeingly
at
the
prim
villas
opposite
sonia
having
her
treasure
stole
up
to
him
feeling
her
near
he
stretched
out
a
hand
and
laid
it
on
her
head
god
is
very
wonderful
said
he
very
mysterious
oh
and
so
good
he
fumbled
absently
and
foolishly
with
her
hair
saying
nothing
more
after
a
while
she
freed
herself
gently
and
led
him
back
to
his
partridge
a
day
or
two
afterwards
geoffrey
came
to
peckham
and
mounted
with
sonia
to
fardetti
rooms
where
the
old
man
embraced
him
tenderly
and
expressed
his
joy
in
the
exuberant
foreign
way
geoffrey
received
the
welcome
with
an
englishman
laughing
embarrassment
perhaps
the
only
fault
that
angelo
fardetti
could
find
in
the
beloved
pupil
was
his
uncompromising
english
manner
and
appearance
his
figure
and
crisp
short
fair
hair
and
fair
moustache
did
not
sufficiently
express
him
as
a
great
musician
angelo
had
to
content
himself
with
the
eyes
musician
eyes
as
he
said
very
bright
arresting
dark
blue
with
depths
like
sapphires
in
which
lay
strange
thoughts
and
human
laughter
i
only
run
in
dear
old
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
you
and
to
give
you
a
ticket
for
my
queen
hall
show
you
come
wo
you
he
asks
if
i
will
come
i
would
get
out
of
my
coffin
and
walk
through
the
streets
i
think
you
be
pleased
said
geoffrey
i
been
goodness
knows
how
long
over
it
and
i
put
into
it
all
i
know
if
it
does
come
off
i
he
paused
you
will
commit
no
rashness
cried
the
old
man
in
alarm
i
will
i
marry
sonia
the
very
next
day
there
was
laughing
talk
and
the
three
spent
a
happy
little
quarter
of
an
hour
but
geoffrey
went
away
without
giving
either
of
the
others
an
inkling
of
the
nature
of
his
famous
symphony
it
was
geoffrey
way
the
fateful
afternoon
arrived
angelo
fardetti
sitting
in
the
stalls
of
the
queen
hall
with
sonia
and
her
parents
looked
round
the
great
auditorium
and
thrilled
with
pleasure
at
seeing
it
full
london
had
thronged
to
hear
the
first
performance
of
his
beloved
symphony
as
a
matter
of
fact
london
had
also
come
to
hear
the
wonderful
orchestra
give
tchaikowsky
fourth
symphony
and
to
hear
lembrich
play
the
violin
and
carli
sing
which
they
did
once
in
a
blue
moon
at
a
symphony
concert
but
in
the
old
man
eyes
these
ineffectual
fires
paled
before
geoffrey
genius
so
great
was
his
suspense
and
agitation
that
he
could
pay
but
scant
attention
to
the
first
two
items
on
the
programme
it
seemed
almost
like
unmeaning
music
far
away
during
the
interval
before
the
symphony
in
e
flat
his
thin
hand
found
sonia
and
held
it
tight
and
she
returned
the
pressure
she
too
was
sick
with
anxiety
the
great
orchestra
tier
upon
tier
was
with
the
performers
scrambling
into
their
places
and
with
leaves
of
scores
being
turned
over
and
with
a
myriad
moving
bows
then
all
having
settled
into
the
order
of
a
vast
machine
geoffrey
appeared
at
the
conductor
stand
comforting
applause
greeted
him
was
he
not
the
rising
hope
of
english
music
many
others
beside
those
four
to
whom
he
was
dear
and
the
mother
and
father
who
sat
a
little
way
in
front
of
them
felt
the
same
nervous
apprehension
the
future
of
english
music
was
at
stake
would
it
be
yet
one
more
disappointment
and
disillusion
or
would
it
rank
the
young
english
composer
with
the
immortals
geoffrey
bowed
smilingly
at
the
audience
turned
and
with
his
baton
gave
the
signal
to
begin
although
only
a
few
years
have
passed
since
that
memorable
first
performance
the
modestly
named
symphony
in
e
flat
is
now
famous
and
geoffrey
chase
is
a
great
man
the
wide
world
over
to
every
lover
of
music
the
symphony
is
familiar
but
only
those
who
were
present
at
the
queen
hall
on
that
late
october
afternoon
can
realise
the
wild
rapture
of
enthusiasm
with
which
the
symphony
was
greeted
it
answered
all
longings
solved
all
mysteries
it
interpreted
for
all
who
had
ears
to
hear
the
fairy
dew
of
love
the
burning
depths
of
passion
sorrow
and
death
and
the
eternal
triumph
of
life
intensely
modern
and
faultless
in
technique
it
was
new
unexpected
individual
unrelated
to
any
school
the
scene
was
one
of
raging
tumult
but
there
was
one
human
being
who
did
not
applaud
and
that
was
the
old
musician
forgotten
of
the
world
angelo
fardetti
he
had
fainted
all
through
the
piece
he
had
sat
bolt
upright
his
nerves
strung
to
his
dark
cheeks
growing
greyer
and
greyer
and
the
stare
in
his
eyes
growing
more
and
more
strange
and
the
grip
on
the
girl
hand
growing
more
and
more
until
she
for
sheer
agony
had
to
free
herself
and
none
concerned
themselves
about
him
not
even
sonia
for
she
was
enwrapped
in
the
soul
of
her
lover
music
and
even
between
the
movements
her
heart
was
too
full
for
speech
or
thought
and
when
she
looked
at
the
old
man
she
saw
him
smile
wanly
and
nod
his
head
as
one
who
like
herself
was
speechless
with
emotion
at
the
end
the
storm
burst
she
rose
with
the
shouting
clapping
and
house
and
suddenly
missing
him
from
her
side
glanced
round
and
saw
him
huddled
up
unconscious
in
his
stall
the
noise
and
movement
were
so
great
that
few
noticed
the
long
lean
old
figure
being
carried
out
of
the
hall
by
one
of
the
side
doors
fortunately
near
in
the
vestibule
attended
by
the
good
anton
and
his
wife
and
sonia
and
a
commissionaire
he
recovered
when
he
could
speak
he
looked
round
and
said
i
am
a
silly
old
fellow
i
am
sorry
i
have
spoiled
your
happiness
i
think
i
must
be
too
old
for
happiness
for
this
is
how
it
has
treated
me
there
was
much
discussion
between
his
friends
as
to
what
should
be
done
but
good
kirilov
once
girlishly
plump
when
angelo
had
first
known
her
now
florid
and
fat
and
motherly
had
her
way
and
leaving
anton
and
sonia
to
see
the
hero
of
the
afternoon
if
they
could
drove
off
in
a
cab
to
peckham
with
the
old
man
and
put
him
to
bed
and
gave
him
homely
remedies
invalid
food
and
drink
and
commanded
him
to
sleep
till
morning
but
angelo
fardetti
disobeyed
her
for
sonia
although
she
had
found
him
meekly
between
the
sheets
when
she
went
up
to
see
him
that
evening
heard
him
later
as
she
was
going
to
bed
his
was
immediately
above
her
playing
over
on
muted
strings
various
themes
of
geoffrey
symphony
at
last
she
went
up
to
his
room
and
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
and
saw
him
a
lank
dilapidated
figure
in
an
old
old
fiddle
and
bow
in
hand
oh
oh
she
rated
you
are
a
naughty
naughty
old
dear
go
to
bed
at
once
he
smiled
like
a
guilty
but
spoiled
child
i
will
go
said
he
in
the
morning
she
herself
took
up
his
simple
breakfast
and
all
the
newspapers
folded
at
the
page
on
which
the
notices
of
the
concert
were
printed
the
press
was
unanimous
in
acclamation
of
the
great
genius
that
had
raised
english
music
to
the
spheres
she
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
read
to
him
while
he
sipped
his
coffee
and
munched
his
roll
and
absorbed
in
her
own
tremendous
happiness
was
content
to
feel
the
glow
of
the
old
man
sympathy
there
was
little
to
be
said
save
exclamatory
pæans
so
overwhelming
was
the
triumph
tears
streamed
down
his
lined
cheeks
and
between
the
tears
there
shone
the
light
of
a
strange
gladness
in
his
eyes
presently
sonia
left
him
and
went
about
her
household
duties
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
she
caught
the
sound
of
his
piano
again
he
was
recalling
bits
of
the
great
symphony
and
she
marvelled
at
his
musical
memory
then
about
eleven
she
saw
him
leave
the
house
and
stride
away
his
head
in
the
air
his
bent
shoulders
curiously
erect
soon
came
the
clatter
of
a
cab
stopping
at
the
front
door
and
geoffrey
chase
for
whom
she
had
been
watching
from
her
window
leaped
out
upon
the
pavement
she
ran
down
and
admitted
him
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
they
stood
clinging
in
a
long
embrace
it
too
wonderful
to
talk
about
she
whispered
then
do
let
us
talk
about
it
he
laughed
as
if
we
could
help
it
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
i
can
you
said
he
and
kissed
her
again
now
in
spite
of
the
spaciousness
of
the
house
in
formosa
terrace
it
had
only
two
as
the
grandiloquently
term
them
and
these
and
were
respectively
occupied
by
anton
and
kirilov
engaged
in
their
morning
lessons
the
passage
where
the
young
people
stood
was
no
fit
place
for
meetings
let
us
go
up
to
the
he
out
said
sonia
they
did
as
they
had
often
done
in
like
circumstances
indeed
the
old
man
before
now
had
given
up
his
to
them
feigning
an
unconquerable
desire
to
walk
abroad
were
they
not
his
children
dearer
to
him
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
so
it
was
natural
that
they
should
make
themselves
at
home
in
his
tiny
den
they
sat
and
talked
of
the
great
victory
of
the
playing
of
the
orchestra
of
passages
that
he
might
take
slower
or
quicker
next
time
of
the
ovation
of
the
mountain
of
congratulatory
telegrams
and
letters
that
blocked
up
his
rooms
they
talked
of
angelo
fardetti
and
his
deep
emotion
and
his
pride
and
they
talked
of
the
future
of
their
marriage
which
was
to
take
place
very
soon
she
suggested
postponement
i
want
you
to
be
quite
sure
this
must
make
a
difference
difference
he
cried
indignantly
she
waved
him
off
and
sat
on
the
by
the
piano
i
must
speak
sensibly
you
are
one
of
the
great
ones
of
the
musical
world
one
of
the
great
ones
of
the
world
itself
you
will
go
on
and
on
you
will
have
all
sorts
of
honours
heaped
on
you
you
will
go
about
among
lords
and
ladies
what
is
called
society
oh
i
know
you
not
be
able
to
help
it
and
all
the
time
i
remain
what
i
am
just
a
poor
little
common
girl
a
member
of
a
ladies
band
i
rather
you
regretted
having
taken
up
with
me
before
than
after
so
we
ought
to
put
it
off
he
answered
her
as
a
good
man
who
loves
deeply
can
only
answer
her
heart
was
convinced
but
she
turned
her
head
aside
and
thought
of
further
argument
her
eye
fell
on
some
music
open
on
the
rest
and
mechanically
with
a
musician
instinct
she
fingered
a
few
bars
the
strange
familiarity
of
the
theme
startled
her
out
of
preoccupation
she
continued
the
treble
and
suddenly
with
a
cold
shiver
of
wonder
crashed
down
both
hands
and
played
on
geoffrey
strode
up
to
her
what
that
you
playing
she
pointed
hastily
to
the
score
he
bent
over
and
stared
at
the
faded
manuscript
why
good
god
he
cried
it
my
symphony
she
stopped
swung
round
and
faced
him
with
fear
in
her
eyes
yes
it
your
symphony
he
took
the
thick
manuscript
from
the
rest
and
looked
at
the
cover
on
it
was
written
the
song
of
life
a
sonata
by
angelo
fardetti
september
there
was
an
amazed
silence
then
in
a
queer
accusing
voice
sonia
cried
out
geoffrey
what
have
you
done
heaven
knows
but
i
never
known
of
this
before
my
god
open
the
thing
somewhere
else
and
see
so
sonia
opened
the
manuscript
at
random
and
played
and
again
it
was
an
echo
of
geoffrey
symphony
he
sank
on
a
chair
like
a
man
crushed
by
an
overwhelming
fatality
and
held
his
head
in
his
hands
i
ought
to
have
done
it
he
groaned
but
it
was
more
than
me
the
thing
overmastered
me
it
haunted
me
so
that
i
could
sleep
and
the
more
it
haunted
me
the
more
it
became
my
own
my
very
own
it
was
too
big
to
lose
sonia
held
him
with
scared
eyes
what
are
you
talking
of
she
asked
the
way
i
came
to
write
the
symphony
it
like
a
nightmare
he
rose
a
couple
of
years
ago
said
he
i
bought
a
bundle
of
old
music
at
a
shop
it
contained
a
collection
of
stuff
which
i
wanted
i
took
the
whole
lot
and
on
going
through
it
found
a
clump
of
old
discoloured
manuscript
partly
in
faded
brown
ink
partly
in
pencil
it
was
mostly
rough
notes
i
tried
it
out
of
curiosity
the
composition
was
feeble
and
the
orchestration
childish
i
thought
it
the
work
of
some
dead
and
forgotten
amateur
but
it
was
crammed
full
of
ideas
crammed
full
of
beauty
i
began
tinkering
it
about
to
amuse
myself
the
more
i
worked
on
it
the
more
it
fascinated
me
it
became
an
obsession
then
i
pitched
the
old
score
away
and
started
it
on
my
own
the
sold
a
lot
of
old
music
about
that
time
said
sonia
the
young
man
threw
up
his
hands
it
a
fatality
an
awful
fatality
my
god
he
cried
to
think
that
i
of
all
men
should
have
stolen
angelo
fardetti
music
no
wonder
he
fainted
yesterday
said
sonia
it
was
catastrophe
both
regarded
it
in
remorseful
silence
sonia
said
at
last
you
have
to
explain
of
course
of
course
but
what
must
the
dear
old
fellow
be
thinking
of
me
what
else
but
that
i
got
hold
of
this
surreptitiously
while
he
was
out
of
the
room
what
else
but
that
i
a
mean
thief
he
loves
you
dear
enough
to
forgive
you
anything
it
the
unforgivable
sin
i
wiped
out
i
cease
to
exist
as
an
honest
man
but
i
had
no
idea
he
cried
with
the
instinct
of
that
i
had
come
so
near
him
i
thought
i
had
just
got
a
theme
here
and
there
i
thought
i
had
recast
all
the
odds
and
ends
according
to
my
own
scheme
he
ran
his
eye
over
a
page
or
two
of
the
score
yes
this
is
practically
the
same
as
the
old
rough
notes
but
there
was
a
lot
of
course
i
could
use
look
at
that
for
instance
he
indicated
a
passage
i
ca
read
it
like
you
said
sonia
i
must
play
it
she
turned
again
to
the
piano
and
played
the
thin
uninspired
music
that
had
no
relation
to
the
symphony
in
e
flat
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
remembered
poignantly
what
the
old
man
had
told
her
of
his
song
of
life
she
went
on
and
on
until
the
music
quickened
into
one
of
the
familiar
themes
and
the
tears
fell
for
she
knew
how
poorly
it
was
treated
and
then
the
door
burst
open
sonia
stopped
dead
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
and
they
both
turned
round
to
find
angelo
fardetti
standing
on
the
threshold
ah
no
he
cried
waving
his
thin
hands
put
that
away
i
did
not
know
i
had
left
it
out
you
must
not
play
that
ah
my
son
my
son
he
rushed
forward
and
clasped
geoffrey
in
his
arms
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheeks
and
murmured
foolish
broken
words
you
have
seen
it
you
have
seen
the
miracle
the
miracle
of
the
good
god
oh
i
am
happy
my
son
my
son
i
am
the
happiest
of
old
men
ah
he
shook
him
tremulously
by
both
shoulders
and
looked
at
him
with
a
magical
light
in
his
old
eyes
you
are
really
what
our
dear
anton
calls
a
prodigy
i
have
thought
and
you
have
executed
santa
maria
he
cried
raising
hands
and
eyes
to
heaven
i
thank
you
for
this
miracle
that
has
been
done
he
turned
away
geoffrey
in
blank
bewilderment
made
a
step
forward
i
never
knew
but
sonia
knowledge
dawning
in
her
face
clapped
her
hand
over
his
mouth
and
he
read
her
conjecture
in
her
eyes
and
drew
a
great
breath
the
old
man
came
again
and
laughed
and
cried
and
wrung
his
hand
and
poured
out
his
joy
and
wonder
into
the
amazed
ears
of
the
young
musician
the
floodgates
of
speech
were
loosened
you
see
what
you
have
done
you
see
the
miracle
this
this
poor
rubbish
is
of
me
angelo
fardetti
on
it
i
spent
my
life
my
blood
my
tears
and
it
is
a
thing
of
nothing
nothing
it
is
wind
and
noise
but
by
the
miracle
of
god
i
breathed
it
into
your
spirit
and
it
grew
and
it
grew
into
all
that
i
dreamed
all
that
i
dreamed
and
could
not
express
it
is
my
song
of
life
sung
as
i
could
have
sung
it
if
i
had
been
a
great
genius
like
you
and
you
have
taken
my
song
from
my
soul
from
my
heart
and
all
the
sublime
harmonies
that
could
get
no
farther
than
this
dull
head
you
have
put
down
in
immortal
music
he
went
on
exalted
and
sonia
and
geoffrey
stood
pale
and
silent
to
undeceive
him
was
impossible
you
see
it
is
a
miracle
he
asked
yes
replied
geoffrey
in
a
low
voice
you
never
saw
this
before
ha
ha
he
laughed
delightedly
not
a
human
soul
has
seen
it
or
heard
it
i
kept
it
locked
up
there
in
my
little
and
it
was
there
all
the
time
i
was
teaching
you
and
you
never
suspected
no
i
did
not
said
the
young
man
truthfully
now
when
did
you
begin
to
think
of
it
how
did
it
come
to
you
my
song
of
life
did
it
sing
in
your
brain
while
you
were
here
and
my
brain
was
guiding
yours
and
then
gather
form
and
shape
all
through
the
long
years
yes
said
geoffrey
that
was
how
it
came
about
angelo
took
sonia
plump
cheeks
between
his
hands
and
smiled
now
you
understand
my
little
sonia
why
i
was
so
foolish
yesterday
it
was
emotion
such
emotion
as
a
man
has
never
felt
before
in
the
world
and
now
you
know
why
i
could
not
speak
this
morning
i
thought
of
the
letter
you
showed
me
he
confessed
that
old
angelo
fardetti
had
inspired
him
but
he
did
not
know
how
i
know
the
little
spark
flew
from
the
soul
of
angelo
fardetti
into
his
soul
and
it
became
a
divine
fire
and
my
song
of
life
is
true
the
symphony
was
born
in
me
it
died
in
me
it
is
so
gloriously
in
him
the
seed
is
imperishable
it
is
eternal
he
broke
away
laughing
through
a
little
sob
and
stood
by
the
window
once
more
gazing
unseeingly
at
the
opposite
villas
of
formosa
terrace
geoffrey
went
up
to
him
and
fell
on
his
knees
it
was
a
most
thing
to
do
and
took
the
old
hand
very
reverently
said
he
yes
it
is
true
i
am
your
father
said
the
old
man
in
italian
and
we
are
bound
together
by
more
than
human
ties
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
man
head
may
all
the
blessings
of
god
be
upon
you
geoffrey
rose
the
humblest
man
in
england
angelo
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
but
his
face
bore
a
beautiful
smile
i
feel
so
happy
said
he
so
happy
that
it
is
terrible
and
i
feel
so
strange
and
my
heart
is
full
if
you
will
forgive
me
i
will
lie
down
for
a
little
he
sank
on
the
sofa
and
smiled
up
in
the
face
of
the
young
man
and
my
head
is
full
of
the
movement
that
i
could
never
write
and
you
have
made
it
like
the
harmonies
before
the
throne
of
god
sit
down
at
the
piano
and
play
it
for
me
my
son
so
geoffrey
took
his
seat
at
the
piano
and
played
and
as
he
played
he
lost
himself
in
his
music
and
sonia
crept
near
and
stood
by
him
in
a
dream
while
the
wonderful
story
of
the
passing
of
human
things
was
told
when
the
sound
of
the
last
chords
had
died
away
she
put
her
arms
round
geoffrey
neck
and
laid
her
cheek
against
his
for
a
while
time
stood
still
then
they
turned
and
saw
the
old
man
sleeping
peacefully
she
whispered
a
word
he
rose
and
they
began
to
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
but
suddenly
instinct
caused
sonia
to
turn
her
head
again
she
stopped
and
gripped
geoffrey
hand
she
caught
a
choking
breath
is
he
asleep
they
went
back
and
bent
over
him
he
was
dead
angelo
fardetti
had
died
of
a
happiness
too
great
for
mortal
man
for
to
which
one
of
us
in
a
hundred
million
is
it
given
to
behold
the
utter
realisation
of
his
life
dream
ladies
in
lavender
i
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
out
of
the
sea
its
light
streamed
through
a
casement
window
into
the
whitest
and
most
spotless
room
you
can
imagine
it
shone
upon
two
little
white
beds
separated
by
the
width
of
the
floor
covered
with
matting
on
white
garments
neatly
folded
which
lay
on
white
chairs
by
the
side
of
each
bed
on
a
white
enamelled
bedroom
suite
on
the
one
picture
over
the
which
adorned
the
white
walls
the
enlarged
photograph
of
a
elderly
gentleman
in
naval
uniform
and
on
the
white
placid
faces
of
the
sleepers
it
awakened
miss
ursula
widdington
who
sat
up
in
bed
greeted
it
with
a
smile
and
forthwith
aroused
her
sister
janet
here
the
sun
miss
widdington
awoke
and
smiled
too
now
to
awake
at
daybreak
with
a
smile
and
a
childlike
delight
at
the
sun
when
you
are
over
is
a
sign
of
an
unruffled
conscience
and
a
sweet
disposition
the
first
glimpse
of
it
for
a
week
said
miss
widdington
is
it
strange
said
miss
ursula
that
when
we
went
to
sleep
the
storm
was
still
raging
and
now
the
sea
has
gone
down
yet
listen
the
tide
coming
in
let
us
go
out
and
look
at
it
cried
miss
ursula
delicately
getting
out
of
bed
you
so
impulsive
ursula
said
miss
widdington
she
was
and
three
years
older
than
her
sister
she
could
therefore
smile
indulgently
at
the
impetuosity
of
youth
but
she
rose
and
dressed
and
presently
the
two
ladies
stole
out
of
the
silent
house
they
had
lived
there
for
many
years
perched
away
on
top
of
a
projecting
cliff
on
the
cornish
coast
midway
between
sea
and
sky
like
two
fairy
princesses
in
an
enchanted
bit
of
the
world
end
who
had
grown
grey
with
waiting
for
the
prince
who
never
came
theirs
was
the
only
house
on
the
height
below
in
the
bay
on
the
right
of
their
small
headland
nestled
the
tiny
fishing
village
of
trevannic
below
sheer
down
to
the
left
lay
a
little
sandy
cove
accessible
farther
on
by
a
narrow
gorge
that
split
the
majestic
stretch
of
bastioned
cliffs
to
that
little
stone
weatherbeaten
house
their
father
the
gentleman
of
the
portrait
had
brought
them
quite
young
when
he
had
retired
from
the
navy
with
a
pension
and
a
grievance
an
ungrateful
country
had
not
made
him
an
admiral
and
there
after
his
death
they
had
continued
to
lead
their
remote
and
gentle
lives
untouched
by
the
happenings
of
the
great
world
the
wind
buffeted
them
dashed
strands
of
hair
stingingly
across
their
faces
and
swirled
their
skirts
around
them
as
they
leaned
over
the
stout
stone
parapet
their
father
had
built
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
drank
in
the
beauty
of
the
morning
the
eastern
sky
was
clear
of
clouds
and
the
eastern
sea
tossed
a
fierce
silver
under
the
sun
and
gradually
deepened
into
frosted
green
which
changed
in
the
west
into
the
deep
ocean
blue
and
the
atlantic
heaved
and
sobbed
after
its
turmoil
of
the
day
before
miss
ursula
pointed
to
the
clouds
in
the
west
and
likened
them
to
angels
thrones
which
was
a
pretty
conceit
miss
widdington
derived
a
suggestion
of
pentecostal
flames
from
the
golden
flashes
of
the
wings
then
she
referred
to
the
appetite
they
would
have
for
breakfast
to
this
last
observation
miss
ursula
did
not
reply
as
she
was
leaning
over
the
parapet
intent
on
something
in
the
cove
below
presently
she
clutched
her
sister
arm
janet
look
down
there
that
black
thing
what
is
it
miss
widdington
gaze
followed
the
pointing
finger
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
that
edged
the
gorge
sprawled
a
thing
checkered
black
and
white
i
do
believe
it
a
man
a
drowned
man
oh
poor
fellow
oh
janet
how
dreadful
she
turned
brown
compassionate
eyes
on
her
sister
who
continued
to
peer
keenly
at
the
helpless
figure
below
do
you
think
he
dead
janet
the
sensible
thing
would
be
to
go
down
and
see
replied
miss
widdington
it
was
by
no
means
the
first
dead
man
cast
up
by
the
waves
that
they
had
stumbled
upon
during
their
long
sojourn
on
this
wild
coast
where
wrecks
and
founderings
and
loss
of
men
lives
at
sea
were
commonplace
happenings
they
were
dealing
with
the
sadly
familiar
and
though
their
gentle
hearts
throbbed
hard
as
they
made
for
the
gorge
and
sped
quickly
down
the
ragged
rocky
path
they
set
about
their
task
as
a
matter
of
course
miss
ursula
reached
the
sand
first
and
walked
over
to
the
body
which
lay
on
a
low
shelf
of
rock
then
she
turned
with
a
glad
cry
janet
he
alive
he
moaning
come
quickly
and
as
janet
joined
her
did
you
ever
see
such
a
beautiful
face
in
your
life
we
should
have
brought
some
brandy
said
miss
widdington
but
as
she
bent
over
the
unconscious
form
a
foolish
moisture
gathered
in
her
eyes
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
forgetfulness
of
alcohol
for
indeed
there
lay
sprawling
anyhow
in
catlike
grace
beneath
them
the
most
romantic
figure
of
a
youth
that
the
sight
of
maiden
ladies
ever
rested
on
he
had
long
black
hair
a
perfectly
chiselled
face
a
preposterously
feminine
mouth
which
partly
open
showed
white
young
teeth
and
the
most
delicate
hands
in
the
world
miss
ursula
murmured
that
he
was
like
a
young
greek
god
miss
widdington
sighed
the
fellow
was
ridiculous
he
was
also
dank
with
sea
water
and
moaned
as
if
he
were
in
pain
but
as
gazing
wrapt
in
wonder
and
admiration
at
young
greek
gods
is
not
much
good
to
them
when
they
are
miss
widdington
despatched
her
sister
in
search
of
help
the
tide
is
still
low
enough
for
you
to
get
round
the
cliff
to
the
village
pendered
will
give
you
some
brandy
and
her
husband
and
luke
will
bring
a
stretcher
you
might
also
send
joe
gullow
on
his
bicycle
for
dr
mead
miss
widdington
as
behoved
one
who
has
the
charge
of
an
orphaned
younger
sister
did
not
allow
the
sentimental
to
weaken
the
practical
miss
ursula
though
she
would
have
preferred
to
stay
by
the
side
of
the
beautiful
youth
was
docile
and
went
forthwith
on
her
errand
miss
widdington
left
alone
with
him
rolled
up
her
jacket
and
pillowed
his
head
on
it
brought
his
limbs
into
an
attitude
suggestive
of
comfort
and
tried
by
chafing
to
restore
him
to
animation
being
unsuccessful
in
this
she
at
last
desisted
and
sat
on
the
rocks
near
by
and
wondered
who
on
earth
he
was
and
where
in
the
world
he
came
from
his
garments
consisted
in
a
nondescript
pair
of
trousers
and
a
flannel
shirt
with
a
collar
which
was
fastened
at
the
neck
not
by
button
or
stud
but
by
a
tasselled
cord
and
he
was
barefoot
miss
widdington
glanced
modestly
at
his
feet
which
were
shapely
and
the
soles
were
soft
and
pink
like
the
palms
of
his
hands
now
had
he
been
the
coarsest
and
most
janet
widdington
would
have
tended
him
with
the
same
devotion
but
the
lingering
though
unoffending
eve
in
her
rejoiced
that
hands
and
feet
betokened
gentler
avocations
than
that
of
sailor
or
fisherman
and
why
heaven
knows
save
that
the
stranded
creature
had
a
pretty
face
and
that
his
long
black
hair
was
flung
over
his
forehead
in
a
most
interesting
manner
she
wished
he
would
open
his
eyes
but
as
he
kept
them
shut
and
gave
no
sign
of
returning
consciousness
she
sat
there
waiting
patiently
in
front
of
her
the
rough
atlantic
at
her
feet
the
semicircular
patch
of
golden
sand
behind
her
the
sheer
white
cliffs
and
by
her
side
on
the
slab
of
rock
this
piece
of
jetsam
at
length
miss
ursula
appeared
round
the
corner
of
the
headland
followed
by
jan
pendered
and
his
son
luke
carrying
a
stretcher
while
miss
widdington
administered
brandy
without
any
obvious
result
the
men
looked
at
the
castaway
scratched
their
heads
and
guessed
him
to
be
a
foreigner
but
how
he
managed
to
be
there
alone
with
never
a
bit
of
wreckage
to
supply
a
clue
surpassed
their
powers
of
imagination
in
lifting
him
the
right
foot
hung
down
through
the
and
his
ankle
was
seen
to
be
horribly
black
and
swollen
old
jan
examined
it
carefully
broken
said
he
oh
poor
boy
that
why
he
moaning
so
cried
the
compassionate
miss
ursula
the
men
grasped
the
handles
of
the
stretcher
i
better
take
him
home
to
my
old
woman
said
jan
pendered
thoughtfully
he
can
have
my
bed
father
said
luke
miss
widdington
looked
at
miss
ursula
and
miss
ursula
looked
at
miss
widdington
and
the
eyes
of
each
lady
were
wistful
then
miss
widdington
spoke
you
can
carry
him
up
to
the
house
pendered
we
have
a
comfortable
spare
room
and
dorcas
will
help
us
to
look
after
him
the
men
obeyed
for
in
trevannic
miss
widdington
gentle
word
was
law
ii
it
was
early
afternoon
miss
widdington
had
retired
to
take
her
customary
siesta
an
indulgence
permitted
to
her
seniority
but
not
granted
except
on
rare
occasions
to
the
young
miss
ursula
therefore
kept
watch
in
the
sick
chamber
just
such
a
little
white
spotless
room
as
their
own
but
containing
only
one
little
white
bed
in
which
the
youth
lay
dry
and
warm
and
comfortably
asleep
he
was
exhausted
from
cold
and
exposure
said
the
doctor
who
had
driven
in
from
madoc
eight
miles
off
and
his
ankle
was
broken
the
doctor
had
done
what
was
necessary
had
swathed
him
in
one
of
old
dorcas
flannel
nightgowns
and
had
departed
miss
ursula
had
the
patient
all
to
herself
a
bright
fire
burned
in
the
grate
and
the
strong
atlantic
breeze
came
in
through
the
open
window
where
she
sat
her
knitting
in
her
hand
now
and
then
she
glanced
at
the
sleeper
longing
in
a
most
feminine
manner
for
him
to
awake
and
render
an
account
of
himself
miss
ursula
heart
fluttered
mildly
for
beautiful
youths
baffling
curiosity
are
not
washed
up
alive
by
the
sea
at
an
old
maid
feet
every
day
in
the
week
it
was
indeed
an
adventure
a
bit
of
a
fairy
tale
suddenly
gleaming
and
dancing
in
the
grey
atmosphere
of
an
eventless
life
she
glanced
at
him
again
and
wondered
whether
he
had
a
mother
presently
dorcas
came
in
stout
and
matronly
and
cast
a
maternal
eye
on
the
boy
and
smoothed
his
pillow
she
had
sons
herself
and
two
of
them
had
been
claimed
by
the
pitiless
sea
it
lucky
i
had
a
sensible
nightgown
to
give
him
she
remarked
if
we
had
had
only
the
flimsy
things
that
you
and
miss
janet
wear
sh
said
miss
ursula
colouring
faintly
he
might
hear
you
dorcas
laughed
and
went
out
miss
ursula
needles
clicked
rapidly
when
she
glanced
at
the
bed
again
she
became
conscious
of
two
great
dark
eyes
regarding
her
in
utter
wonder
she
rose
quickly
and
went
over
to
the
bed
do
be
afraid
she
said
though
what
there
was
to
terrify
him
in
her
mild
demeanour
and
the
spotless
room
she
could
not
have
explained
do
be
afraid
you
among
friends
he
murmured
some
words
which
she
did
not
catch
what
do
you
say
she
asked
sweetly
he
repeated
them
in
a
stronger
voice
then
she
realised
that
he
spoke
in
a
foreign
tongue
a
queer
dismay
filled
her
do
you
speak
english
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
puzzled
then
the
echo
of
the
last
word
seemed
to
reach
his
intelligence
he
shook
his
head
a
memory
rose
from
schoolgirl
days
français
she
faltered
and
when
he
shook
his
head
again
she
almost
felt
relieved
then
he
began
to
talk
regarding
her
earnestly
as
if
seeking
by
his
mere
intentness
to
make
her
understand
but
it
was
a
strange
language
which
she
had
not
heard
before
in
one
mighty
effort
miss
ursula
gathered
together
her
whole
stock
of
german
sie
deutsch
ja
einige
worte
he
replied
and
his
face
lit
up
with
a
smile
so
radiant
that
miss
ursula
wondered
how
providence
could
have
neglected
to
inspire
a
being
so
beautiful
with
a
knowledge
of
the
english
language
kann
mich
auf
deutsch
verständlich
machen
aber
ich
bin
but
not
a
word
of
the
halting
sentence
could
miss
ursula
make
out
even
the
last
was
swallowed
up
in
guttural
unintelligibility
she
only
recognised
the
speech
as
german
and
different
from
that
which
he
used
at
first
and
which
seemed
to
be
his
native
tongue
oh
dear
i
must
give
it
up
she
sighed
the
patient
moved
slightly
and
uttered
a
sudden
cry
of
pain
it
occurred
to
miss
ursula
that
he
had
not
had
time
to
realise
the
fractured
ankle
that
he
realised
it
now
was
obvious
for
he
lay
back
with
closed
eyes
and
white
lips
until
the
spasm
had
passed
after
that
miss
ursula
did
her
best
to
explain
in
pantomime
what
had
happened
she
made
a
gesture
of
swimming
then
laid
her
cheek
on
her
hand
and
simulated
fainting
acted
her
discovery
of
his
body
on
the
beach
broke
a
wooden
match
in
two
and
pointed
to
his
ankle
exhibited
the
medicine
bottles
by
the
bedside
smoothed
his
pillow
and
smiled
so
as
to
assure
him
of
kind
treatment
he
understood
more
or
less
murmured
thanks
in
his
own
language
took
her
hand
and
to
her
english
astonishment
pressed
it
to
his
lips
miss
widdington
entering
softly
found
the
pair
in
this
romantic
situation
when
it
dawned
on
him
a
while
later
that
he
owed
his
deliverance
equally
to
both
of
the
gentle
ladies
he
kissed
miss
widdington
hand
too
whereupon
miss
ursula
coloured
and
turned
away
she
did
not
like
to
see
him
kiss
her
sister
hand
why
she
could
not
tell
but
she
felt
as
if
she
had
received
a
tiny
stab
in
the
heart
iii
providence
has
showered
many
blessings
on
trevannic
but
among
them
is
not
the
gift
of
tongues
mead
who
came
over
every
day
from
madoc
knew
less
german
than
the
ladies
it
was
impossible
to
communicate
with
the
boy
except
by
signs
old
jan
pendered
who
had
served
in
the
navy
in
the
china
seas
felt
confident
that
he
could
make
him
understand
and
tried
him
with
but
the
youth
only
smiled
sweetly
and
shook
hands
with
him
whereupon
old
jan
scratched
his
head
and
acknowledged
himself
jiggered
to
miss
widdington
at
last
came
the
inspiration
that
the
word
meant
polish
you
come
from
poland
polen
laughed
the
boy
kosciusko
murmured
miss
ursula
he
laughed
again
delighted
and
looked
at
her
eagerly
for
more
but
there
miss
ursula
conversation
about
poland
ended
if
the
discovery
of
his
nationality
lay
to
the
credit
of
her
sister
she
it
was
who
found
out
his
name
andrea
marowski
and
taught
him
to
say
miss
ursula
she
also
taught
him
the
english
names
of
the
various
objects
around
him
and
here
the
innocent
rivalry
of
the
two
ladies
began
to
take
definite
form
miss
widdington
without
taking
counsel
of
miss
ursula
borrowed
an
old
otto
german
grammar
from
the
girls
school
at
madoc
and
by
means
of
patient
research
put
to
him
such
questions
as
have
you
a
mother
how
old
are
you
and
collating
his
written
replies
with
the
information
vouchsafed
by
the
grammar
succeeded
in
discovering
among
other
biographical
facts
that
he
was
alone
in
the
world
save
for
an
old
uncle
who
lived
in
cracow
and
that
he
was
twenty
years
of
age
so
that
when
miss
ursula
boasted
that
she
had
taught
him
to
say
good
morning
how
do
you
do
miss
widdington
could
cry
with
an
air
of
triumph
he
told
me
that
he
does
suffer
from
toothache
it
was
one
of
the
curious
features
of
the
ministrations
which
they
afforded
andrea
marowski
alternately
that
miss
ursula
would
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
otto
german
grammar
and
miss
widdington
scorned
the
use
of
english
and
made
as
little
use
of
sign
language
as
possible
i
do
think
it
becoming
ursula
she
said
to
indicate
hunger
by
opening
your
mouth
and
rubbing
the
front
of
your
waist
like
a
cannibal
miss
ursula
accepted
the
rebuke
meekly
for
she
never
returned
a
pert
answer
to
her
senior
but
reflecting
that
janet
disapproval
might
possibly
arise
from
her
want
of
skill
in
the
art
of
pantomime
she
went
away
comforted
and
continued
her
unbecoming
practices
the
conversations
however
that
the
ladies
each
in
her
own
way
managed
to
have
with
the
invalid
were
sadly
limited
in
scope
no
means
that
they
could
devise
could
bring
them
enlightenment
on
many
interesting
points
who
he
was
whether
noble
or
peasant
how
he
came
to
be
lying
like
a
jellyfish
on
the
slab
of
rock
in
their
cove
coatless
and
barefoot
remained
as
great
a
puzzle
as
ever
of
course
he
informed
them
especially
the
miss
widdington
over
and
over
again
in
his
execrable
german
but
they
grew
no
wiser
and
at
last
they
abandoned
in
despair
their
attempts
to
solve
these
mysteries
they
contented
themselves
with
the
actual
which
indeed
was
enough
to
absorb
their
simple
minds
there
he
was
cast
up
by
the
sea
or
fallen
from
the
moon
young
gay
and
helpless
a
veritable
gift
of
the
gods
the
very
mystery
of
his
adventure
invested
him
with
a
curious
charm
and
then
the
prodigious
appetite
with
which
he
began
to
devour
fish
and
eggs
and
chickens
formed
of
itself
a
joy
hitherto
undreamed
of
in
their
philosophy
when
he
gets
up
he
must
have
some
clothes
said
miss
widdington
miss
ursula
agreed
but
did
not
say
that
she
was
knitting
him
socks
in
secret
andrea
interest
in
the
progress
of
these
garments
was
one
of
her
chief
delights
there
the
trunk
upstairs
with
our
dear
father
things
said
miss
widdington
with
more
diffidence
than
usual
they
are
so
sacred
to
us
that
i
was
wondering
our
dear
father
would
be
the
first
to
wish
it
said
miss
ursula
it
a
christian
duty
to
clothe
the
naked
said
miss
widdington
and
so
we
must
clothe
him
in
what
we
got
said
miss
ursula
then
with
a
slight
flush
she
added
it
so
many
years
since
our
great
loss
that
i
almost
forgotten
what
a
man
wears
i
have
said
miss
widdington
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
ursula
she
continued
after
pausing
to
put
sugar
and
milk
into
the
cup
of
tea
which
she
handed
to
her
sister
they
were
at
the
breakfast
table
at
the
head
of
which
she
formally
presided
as
she
had
done
since
her
emancipation
from
the
schoolroom
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
have
decided
to
devote
my
pounds
to
buying
him
an
outfit
our
dear
father
things
can
only
be
a
makeshift
and
the
poor
boy
has
a
penny
in
the
pockets
he
came
ashore
in
now
some
three
years
before
an
aunt
had
bequeathed
miss
widdington
a
tiny
legacy
the
disposal
of
which
had
been
a
continuous
subject
of
grave
discussion
between
the
sisters
she
always
alluded
to
it
as
my
pounds
is
that
quite
fair
dear
said
miss
ursula
impulsively
fair
do
you
mind
explaining
miss
ursula
regretted
her
impetuosity
do
you
think
dear
janet
she
said
with
some
nervousness
that
it
would
lay
him
under
too
great
an
obligation
to
you
personally
i
should
prefer
to
take
the
money
our
of
out
joint
income
we
both
are
responsible
for
him
and
she
added
with
a
timid
smile
i
found
him
first
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
miss
widdington
retorted
with
a
quite
unusual
touch
of
acidity
but
if
you
feel
strongly
about
it
i
am
willing
to
withdraw
my
pounds
you
not
angry
with
me
janet
angry
of
course
not
miss
widdington
replied
freezingly
do
be
silly
and
why
are
you
eating
your
bacon
this
was
the
first
shadow
of
dissension
that
had
arisen
between
them
since
their
childhood
on
the
way
to
the
miss
ursula
shed
a
few
tears
over
janet
hectoring
ways
and
miss
widdington
in
pursuit
of
her
housekeeping
duties
made
dorcas
the
scapegoat
for
unreasonableness
before
luncheon
time
they
kissed
with
mutual
apologies
but
the
spirit
of
rivalry
was
by
no
means
quenched
iv
one
afternoon
miss
janet
had
an
inspiration
if
i
played
the
piano
in
the
with
the
windows
open
you
could
hear
it
in
the
spare
room
quite
plainly
if
you
think
it
would
disturb
andrea
said
miss
ursula
you
might
shut
the
windows
i
was
proposing
to
offer
him
a
distraction
dear
said
miss
widdington
these
foreign
gentlemen
are
generally
fond
of
music
miss
ursula
could
raise
no
objection
but
her
heart
sank
she
could
not
play
the
piano
she
took
her
seat
cheerfully
however
by
the
bed
which
had
been
wheeled
up
to
the
window
so
that
the
patient
could
look
out
on
the
glory
of
sky
and
sea
took
her
knitting
from
a
drawer
and
began
to
turn
the
heel
of
one
of
the
sacred
socks
andrea
watched
her
lazily
and
contentedly
perhaps
he
had
never
seen
two
such
ladies
in
lavender
in
his
life
he
often
tried
to
give
some
expression
to
his
gratitude
and
the
had
become
a
thrice
daily
custom
for
miss
widdington
he
had
written
the
word
engel
which
the
vocabulary
at
the
end
of
otto
german
grammar
rendered
as
angel
whereat
she
had
blushed
quite
prettily
for
miss
ursula
he
had
drawn
very
badly
but
still
unmistakably
the
picture
of
a
winged
denizen
of
paradise
and
she
too
had
treasured
the
compliment
she
also
treasured
the
drawing
now
miss
ursula
held
up
the
knitting
which
began
distinctly
to
indicate
the
shape
of
a
sock
and
smiled
andrea
smiled
too
and
blew
her
a
kiss
with
his
fingers
he
had
many
graceful
foreign
gestures
the
doctor
who
was
a
plain
briton
disapproved
of
andrea
and
expressed
to
dorcas
his
opinion
that
the
next
things
to
be
washed
ashore
would
be
the
young
man
monkey
and
organ
this
was
sheer
prejudice
for
andrea
manners
were
unexceptionable
and
his
smile
in
the
eyes
of
his
hostesses
the
most
attractive
thing
in
the
world
heel
said
miss
ursula
repeated
andrea
wool
said
miss
ursula
vool
said
andrea
no
said
miss
ursula
puffing
out
her
lips
so
as
to
accentuate
the
said
andrea
doing
the
same
and
then
they
both
burst
out
laughing
they
were
enjoying
themselves
mightily
then
from
the
below
came
the
tinkling
sound
of
the
old
untuned
piano
which
had
remained
unopened
for
many
years
it
was
the
spring
song
of
mendelssohn
played
schoolgirl
fashion
with
uncertain
fingers
that
now
and
then
struck
false
notes
the
light
died
away
from
andrea
face
and
he
looked
inquiringly
if
not
wonderingly
at
miss
ursula
she
smiled
encouragement
pointed
first
at
the
floor
and
then
at
him
thereby
indicating
that
the
music
was
for
his
benefit
for
awhile
he
remained
quite
patient
at
last
he
clapped
his
hands
on
his
ears
and
his
features
distorted
with
pain
cried
out
nein
nein
das
lieb
ich
nicht
es
ist
hässlich
in
eager
pantomime
he
besought
her
to
stop
the
entertainment
miss
ursula
went
downstairs
hating
to
hurt
her
sister
feelings
yet
unable
to
crush
a
wicked
unregenerate
feeling
of
pleasure
i
am
so
sorry
dear
janet
she
said
laying
her
hand
on
her
arm
but
he
does
like
music
it
astonishing
his
dislike
it
makes
him
quite
violent
miss
widdington
ceased
playing
and
accompanied
her
sister
upstairs
andrea
with
an
expressive
shrug
of
the
shoulders
reached
out
his
two
hands
to
the
musician
and
taking
hers
kissed
her
miss
widdington
consulted
otto
sie
nicht
musik
he
cried
and
laughing
played
an
imaginary
fiddle
he
like
music
cried
miss
widdington
how
can
you
make
such
silly
mistakes
ursula
only
he
prefers
the
violin
miss
ursula
grew
downcast
for
a
moment
then
she
brightened
a
brilliant
idea
occurred
to
her
adam
penruddocke
he
has
a
fiddle
we
can
ask
him
to
come
up
after
tea
and
play
to
us
she
reassured
andrea
in
her
queer
and
later
in
the
afternoon
adam
penruddocke
a
sheepish
giant
of
a
fisherman
was
shown
into
the
room
he
bowed
to
the
ladies
shook
the
long
white
hand
proffered
him
by
the
beautiful
youth
tuned
up
and
played
the
carnival
of
venice
from
start
to
finish
andrea
regarded
him
with
mischievous
laughing
eyes
and
at
the
end
he
applauded
vigorously
miss
widdington
turned
to
her
sister
i
knew
he
liked
music
she
said
shall
i
play
something
else
sir
asked
penruddocke
andrea
guessing
his
meaning
beckoned
him
to
approach
the
bed
and
took
the
violin
and
bow
from
his
hands
he
looked
at
the
instrument
critically
smiled
to
himself
tuned
it
afresh
and
with
an
air
of
intense
happiness
drew
the
bow
across
the
strings
why
he
can
play
it
cried
miss
ursula
andrea
laughed
and
nodded
and
played
a
bit
of
the
carnival
of
venice
as
it
ought
to
be
played
with
gaiety
and
mischief
then
he
broke
off
and
after
two
or
three
tearing
chords
that
made
his
hearers
start
plunged
into
a
wild
czardas
the
ladies
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
as
the
mad
music
such
as
they
had
never
heard
in
their
lives
before
filled
the
little
room
with
its
riot
and
devilry
penruddocke
stood
and
panted
his
eyes
staring
out
of
his
head
when
andrea
had
finished
there
was
a
bewildered
silence
he
nodded
pleasantly
at
his
audience
delighted
at
the
effect
he
had
produced
then
with
an
artist
malice
he
went
to
the
other
extreme
of
emotion
he
played
a
sobbing
rending
the
heart
with
cries
of
woe
and
desolation
and
broken
hopes
it
clutched
at
the
turning
them
into
vibrating
chords
it
pierced
the
soul
with
its
poignant
despair
it
ended
in
a
note
high
up
in
the
treble
whose
pain
became
intolerable
and
the
end
was
greeted
with
a
sharp
gasp
of
relief
the
white
lips
of
the
ruddy
giant
quivered
tears
streamed
down
the
cheeks
of
miss
widdington
and
miss
ursula
again
there
was
silence
but
this
time
it
was
broken
by
a
clear
shrill
voice
outside
encore
encore
the
sisters
looked
at
one
another
who
had
dared
intrude
at
such
a
moment
miss
widdington
went
to
the
window
to
see
in
the
garden
stood
a
young
woman
of
independent
bearing
with
a
pallette
and
brushes
in
her
hand
an
easel
was
pitched
a
few
yards
beyond
the
gate
miss
widdington
regarded
this
young
woman
with
marked
disfavour
the
girl
calmly
raised
her
eyes
i
apologise
for
trespassing
like
this
she
said
but
i
simply
could
resist
coming
nearer
to
this
marvellous
and
my
exclamation
came
out
almost
unconsciously
you
are
quite
welcome
to
listen
said
miss
widdington
stiffly
may
i
ask
who
is
playing
it
miss
widdington
almost
gasped
at
the
girl
impertinence
the
latter
laughed
frankly
i
ask
because
it
seems
as
if
it
could
only
be
one
of
the
big
people
it
a
young
friend
who
is
staying
with
us
said
miss
widdington
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
girl
but
you
see
my
brother
is
boris
danilof
the
violinist
so
i
that
excuse
for
being
interested
i
do
think
andrea
can
play
any
more
said
miss
ursula
from
her
seat
by
the
bed
he
tired
miss
widdington
repeated
this
information
to
miss
danilof
who
bade
her
good
afternoon
and
withdrew
to
her
easel
a
most
forward
objectionable
girl
exclaimed
miss
widdington
and
who
is
boris
danilof
i
should
like
to
know
if
she
had
but
understood
german
andrea
could
have
told
her
he
caught
at
the
name
of
the
violinist
and
bent
eagerly
forward
in
great
excitement
boris
danilof
er
i
mean
replied
miss
widdington
proud
at
not
having
to
consult
otto
andrea
sank
back
disappointed
on
his
pillow
v
however
much
miss
widdington
disapproved
of
the
young
woman
and
however
little
the
sisters
knew
of
boris
danilof
it
was
obvious
that
they
were
harbouring
a
remarkable
violinist
that
even
the
doctor
who
had
played
the
double
bass
in
his
hospital
orchestral
society
and
was
therefore
an
authority
freely
admitted
it
gave
the
romantic
youth
a
new
and
somewhat
value
in
the
eyes
of
the
ladies
he
was
a
genius
said
miss
ursula
and
her
imagination
became
touched
by
the
magic
of
the
word
as
he
grew
stronger
he
played
more
his
fame
spread
through
the
village
and
he
gave
recitals
to
crowded
audiences
as
many
as
could
be
squeezed
into
the
little
bedroom
and
more
standing
in
the
garden
below
miss
danilof
did
not
come
again
the
ladies
learned
that
she
was
staying
in
the
next
village
polwern
two
or
three
miles
off
in
their
joy
at
andrea
recovery
they
forgot
her
existence
happy
days
came
when
he
could
rise
from
bed
and
hobble
about
on
a
crutch
attired
in
the
quaint
garments
of
captain
widdington
who
had
died
twenty
years
before
at
the
age
of
they
added
to
his
romantic
appearance
giving
him
the
air
of
the
in
costume
drama
there
was
a
blue
waistcoat
with
gilt
buttons
calculated
to
win
any
feminine
approval
the
ladies
admired
him
vastly
conversation
was
still
difficult
as
miss
ursula
had
succeeded
in
teaching
him
very
little
english
and
miss
widdington
after
a
desperate
grapple
with
otto
on
her
own
account
had
given
up
the
german
language
in
despair
but
what
matters
the
tongue
when
the
heart
speaks
and
the
hearts
of
miss
widdington
and
miss
ursula
spoke
delicately
timidly
tremulously
in
the
whisper
of
an
evening
breeze
in
undertones
it
is
true
yet
they
spoke
all
the
same
the
first
walks
on
the
heather
of
their
cliff
in
the
pure
spring
sunshine
were
rare
joys
as
they
had
done
with
their
watches
by
his
bedside
they
took
it
in
turns
to
walk
with
him
and
each
in
her
turn
of
solitude
felt
little
pricklings
of
jealousy
but
as
each
had
instituted
with
him
her
own
particular
dainty
relations
and
confidences
miss
widdington
more
maternal
miss
ursula
more
sisterly
to
which
his
artistic
nature
responded
involuntarily
each
felt
sure
that
she
was
the
one
who
had
gained
his
especial
affection
thus
they
wove
their
gossamer
webs
of
romance
in
the
secret
recess
of
their
souls
what
they
hoped
for
was
as
dim
and
vague
as
their
concept
of
heaven
and
as
pure
they
looked
only
at
the
near
future
a
circle
of
light
encompassed
by
mists
but
in
the
circle
stood
ever
the
beloved
figure
they
could
not
imagine
him
out
of
it
he
would
stay
with
them
irradiating
their
lives
with
his
youth
and
his
gaiety
playing
to
them
his
divine
music
kissing
their
hands
until
he
grew
quite
strong
and
well
again
and
that
was
a
long
long
way
off
meanwhile
life
was
a
perpetual
spring
why
should
it
ever
end
one
afternoon
they
sat
in
the
sunny
garden
the
ladies
busy
with
needlework
and
andrea
playing
snatches
of
dreamy
things
on
the
violin
the
dainty
remains
of
tea
stood
on
a
table
and
the
young
man
crutch
rested
against
it
presently
he
began
to
play
tschaikowsky
chanson
triste
miss
ursula
looking
up
saw
a
girl
of
plain
face
and
independent
bearing
standing
by
the
gate
who
is
that
janet
she
whispered
miss
janet
glanced
round
it
is
the
impertinent
young
woman
who
was
listening
the
other
day
andrea
followed
their
glances
and
perceiving
a
third
listener
half
consciously
played
to
her
when
the
piece
was
finished
the
girl
slowly
walked
away
i
know
it
wrong
and
unchristianlike
said
miss
widdington
but
i
dislike
that
girl
intensely
so
do
i
said
miss
ursula
then
she
laughed
she
looks
like
the
wicked
fairy
in
a
vi
the
time
came
when
he
threw
aside
his
crutch
and
flew
laughing
away
beyond
their
control
this
they
did
not
mind
for
he
always
came
back
and
accompanied
them
on
their
wild
rambles
he
now
resembled
the
ordinary
young
man
of
the
day
as
nearly
as
the
madoc
tailors
and
hosiers
could
contrive
and
the
astonishing
fellow
with
his
cameo
face
and
his
hyacinthine
locks
still
looked
picturesque
one
morning
he
took
pendruddocke
fiddle
and
went
off
in
high
spirits
and
when
he
returned
in
the
late
afternoon
his
face
was
flushed
and
a
new
light
burned
in
his
eyes
he
explained
his
adventures
volubly
they
had
a
vague
impression
that
he
had
been
playing
his
stringed
instrument
to
dolphins
and
waves
and
things
some
miles
off
along
the
coast
to
please
him
they
said
at
every
pause
in
his
narration
and
he
thought
they
understood
finally
he
kissed
their
hands
two
mornings
later
he
started
without
his
fiddle
immediately
after
breakfast
to
miss
ursula
who
accompanied
him
down
the
road
to
the
village
he
announced
polwern
as
his
destination
unsuspecting
and
happy
she
bade
him
and
lovingly
watched
his
lithe
young
figure
disappear
behind
the
bounding
cliff
of
the
little
bay
miss
olga
danilof
sat
reading
a
novel
by
the
door
of
the
cottage
where
she
lodged
when
the
beautiful
youth
came
up
he
raised
his
hat
she
nodded
well
she
said
in
german
have
you
told
the
funny
old
maids
said
he
they
are
dear
gracious
ladies
but
i
have
told
them
i
heard
from
my
brother
she
remarked
taking
a
letter
from
the
book
he
trusts
my
judgment
implicitly
as
i
said
he
would
and
you
are
to
come
with
me
to
london
at
once
by
the
midday
train
he
looked
at
her
in
amazement
but
the
dear
ladies
you
can
write
and
explain
my
brother
time
is
valuable
he
has
already
put
off
his
journey
to
paris
one
day
in
order
to
see
you
but
i
have
no
money
he
objected
weakly
what
does
that
matter
i
have
enough
for
the
railway
ticket
and
when
you
see
boris
he
will
give
you
an
advance
oh
do
be
grateful
she
added
in
her
independent
way
in
the
first
place
we
brother
artists
and
in
the
second
it
a
pure
matter
of
business
it
much
better
to
put
yourself
in
the
hands
of
boris
danilof
and
make
a
fortune
in
europe
than
to
play
in
a
restaurant
orchestra
in
new
york
do
you
think
so
andrea
did
think
so
and
he
blessed
the
storm
that
drove
the
ship
out
of
its
course
from
hamburg
and
terrified
him
out
of
his
wits
in
his
steerage
quarters
so
that
he
rushed
on
deck
in
shirt
and
trousers
grasping
a
only
to
be
cursed
one
moment
by
a
sailor
and
the
next
to
be
swept
by
a
wave
clean
over
the
taffrail
into
the
sea
he
blessed
the
storm
and
he
blessed
the
wave
and
he
blessed
the
which
he
lost
just
before
consciousness
left
him
and
he
blessed
the
jag
of
rock
on
the
sandy
cove
against
which
he
must
have
broken
his
ankle
and
he
blessed
the
ladies
and
the
sun
and
the
sea
and
sky
and
olga
danilof
and
the
whole
of
this
beautiful
world
that
had
suddenly
laid
itself
at
his
feet
the
village
cart
drew
up
by
the
door
and
miss
danilof
luggage
that
lay
ready
in
the
hall
was
lifted
in
come
she
said
you
can
ask
the
old
maids
to
send
on
your
things
he
laughed
i
have
no
things
i
am
as
free
as
the
wind
at
madoc
whence
he
intended
to
send
a
telegram
to
the
dear
gracious
ladies
they
only
had
just
time
to
catch
the
train
he
sent
no
telegram
and
as
they
approached
london
he
thought
less
and
less
about
it
his
mind
after
the
manner
of
youth
full
of
the
wonder
that
was
to
be
vii
the
ladies
sat
down
to
tea
eggs
were
ready
to
be
boiled
as
soon
as
he
returned
not
having
lunched
he
would
be
hungry
but
he
did
not
come
by
they
grew
anxious
they
postponed
the
meal
dorcas
came
into
the
periodically
to
report
deterioration
of
cooked
viands
but
they
could
not
eat
the
meal
alone
at
last
they
grew
terrified
lest
some
evil
should
have
befallen
him
and
miss
widdington
went
in
to
the
village
and
despatched
jan
pendered
and
joe
gullow
on
his
bicycle
in
search
when
she
returned
she
found
miss
ursula
looking
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
janet
that
girl
is
living
there
where
polwern
he
went
there
this
morning
miss
widdington
felt
as
if
a
cold
hand
had
touched
her
heart
but
she
knew
that
it
behoved
her
as
the
elder
to
dismiss
her
sister
fears
you
talking
nonsense
ursula
he
has
never
met
her
how
do
we
know
urged
miss
ursula
i
do
consider
it
delicate
replied
miss
widdington
to
discuss
the
possibility
they
said
no
more
and
went
out
and
stood
by
the
gate
waiting
for
their
messengers
the
moon
rose
and
silvered
the
sea
and
the
sea
breeze
sprang
up
the
surf
broke
in
a
melancholy
rhythm
on
the
sands
beneath
it
sounds
like
the
triste
said
miss
ursula
and
before
them
both
rose
the
picture
of
the
girl
standing
there
like
an
evil
fairy
while
andrea
played
at
last
jan
pendered
appeared
on
the
cliff
the
ladies
went
out
to
meet
him
then
they
learned
what
had
happened
in
a
dignified
way
they
thanked
jan
pendered
and
gave
him
a
shilling
for
joe
gullow
who
had
brought
the
news
they
bade
him
good
night
in
clear
brave
voices
and
walked
back
very
silent
and
upright
through
the
garden
into
the
house
in
the
they
turned
to
each
other
and
their
arms
about
each
other
necks
they
broke
down
utterly
the
stranger
woman
had
come
and
had
taken
him
away
from
them
youth
had
flown
magnetically
to
youth
they
were
left
alone
unheeded
in
the
dry
lavender
of
their
lives
the
moonlight
streamed
through
the
casement
window
into
the
white
spotless
room
it
shone
on
the
two
little
white
beds
on
the
white
garments
neatly
folded
on
white
chairs
on
the
gentleman
over
the
and
on
the
white
faces
of
the
sisters
they
slept
little
that
night
once
miss
widdington
spoke
ursula
we
must
go
to
sleep
and
forget
it
all
we
been
two
old
fools
miss
ursula
sobbed
for
answer
with
the
dawn
came
a
certain
quietude
of
spirit
she
rose
put
on
her
and
leaving
her
sister
asleep
stole
out
on
tiptoe
the
window
was
open
and
the
curtains
were
undrawn
in
the
boy
empty
room
she
leaned
on
the
sill
and
looked
out
over
the
sea
sooner
or
later
she
knew
would
come
a
letter
of
explanation
she
hoped
janet
would
not
force
her
to
read
it
she
no
longer
wanted
to
know
whence
he
came
whither
he
was
going
it
were
better
for
her
she
thought
not
to
know
it
were
better
for
her
to
cherish
the
most
beautiful
thing
that
had
ever
entered
her
life
for
all
those
years
she
had
waited
for
the
prince
who
never
came
and
he
had
come
at
last
out
of
fairyland
cast
up
by
the
sea
she
had
had
with
him
her
brief
season
of
tremulous
happiness
if
he
had
been
carried
on
against
his
will
by
the
strange
woman
into
the
unknown
whence
he
had
emerged
it
was
only
the
inevitable
ending
of
such
a
fairy
tale
thus
wisdom
came
to
her
from
sea
and
sky
and
made
her
strong
she
smiled
through
her
tears
and
she
the
weaker
went
forth
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
to
comfort
and
direct
her
sister
studies
in
blindness
i
an
episode
i
i
have
often
thought
of
editing
the
diary
which
is
in
my
possession
of
one
jeremy
wendover
of
bullingford
in
the
county
of
berkshire
england
who
departed
this
life
in
the
year
of
grace
and
giving
to
the
world
a
document
as
human
as
the
record
of
pepys
and
as
deeply
imbued
with
the
piety
of
a
devout
christian
as
the
confessions
of
saint
augustine
a
little
emendation
of
an
occasional
ungrammatical
and
disjointed
text
though
in
the
main
the
diary
is
written
in
the
scholarly
florid
style
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
little
intelligent
conjecture
as
to
certain
dates
a
footnote
now
and
then
elucidating
an
obscure
reference
and
the
thing
would
be
done
it
has
been
a
great
temptation
but
i
have
resisted
it
the
truth
is
that
to
the
casual
reader
the
human
side
would
seem
to
be
so
meagre
the
pietistic
so
full
one
has
to
seek
so
carefully
for
a
few
flowers
of
fact
among
a
wilderness
of
religious
and
philosophical
fancy
nay
more
to
be
so
much
in
sympathy
with
the
diarist
as
to
translate
the
pious
rhetoric
into
terms
of
mundane
incident
that
only
to
the
curious
student
can
the
real
life
history
of
the
man
be
revealed
and
who
in
these
hurrying
days
would
give
weeks
of
patient
toil
to
a
task
so
barren
of
immediate
profit
i
myself
certainly
would
not
do
it
and
it
is
a
good
working
philosophy
of
life
though
it
has
its
drawbacks
not
to
expect
others
to
do
what
you
would
not
do
yourself
it
is
only
because
the
study
of
these
yellow
pages
covered
with
the
brown
almost
microscopic
pointed
handwriting
has
amused
the
odd
moments
of
years
that
i
have
arrived
at
something
like
a
comprehension
of
the
things
that
mattered
so
much
to
jeremy
wendover
and
so
pathetically
little
to
any
other
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
adam
how
did
the
diary
you
ask
come
into
my
possession
i
picked
it
up
years
ago
for
a
franc
at
a
bookseller
in
geneva
it
had
the
bookplate
of
a
bishop
of
sodor
and
man
and
an
inscription
on
the
flyleaf
john
henderson
calcutta
how
it
came
into
the
hands
of
the
bishop
into
those
of
john
henderson
how
it
passed
thence
and
eventually
found
its
way
to
geneva
heaven
alone
knows
i
have
said
that
jeremy
wendover
departed
this
life
in
my
authority
for
the
statement
is
a
gravestone
in
the
churchyard
of
bullingford
whither
i
have
made
many
pious
pilgrimages
in
the
hope
of
finding
more
records
of
my
obscure
hero
but
i
have
been
unsuccessful
the
house
however
in
which
he
lived
described
at
some
length
in
his
diary
is
still
standing
an
early
tudor
building
the
residence
of
the
maltster
who
owned
the
adjoining
long
gabled
malthouse
and
from
whom
he
rented
it
for
a
considerable
term
of
years
it
is
situated
on
the
river
fringe
of
the
little
town
at
the
end
of
a
lane
running
at
right
angles
to
the
main
street
just
before
this
loses
itself
in
the
market
square
i
have
stood
at
the
front
gate
of
the
house
and
watched
the
thames
some
thirty
yards
away
flow
between
its
banks
the
wide
lush
meadows
and
cornfields
beyond
dotted
here
and
there
with
the
red
roofs
of
farms
and
spreading
amid
the
quiet
greenery
of
oaks
and
chestnuts
to
the
oxfordshire
hills
i
have
breathed
in
the
peace
of
the
evening
air
and
i
have
found
myself
very
near
in
spirit
to
jeremy
wendover
who
stood
as
he
notes
many
and
many
a
summer
afternoon
at
that
gate
watching
the
selfsame
scene
far
away
from
the
fever
and
the
fret
of
life
i
have
thought
therefore
that
instead
of
publishing
his
diary
i
might
with
some
degree
of
sympathy
set
forth
in
brief
the
one
dramatic
episode
in
his
inglorious
career
ii
the
overwhelming
factor
in
jeremy
wendover
life
was
the
appalling
inconceivable
hideousness
of
his
face
the
refined
cultivated
pious
gentleman
was
cursed
with
a
visage
which
it
would
have
pleased
dante
to
ascribe
to
a
white
guelph
whom
he
particularly
disliked
and
would
have
made
orcagna
shudder
in
the
midst
of
his
dreams
of
shapes
of
hell
as
a
child
of
six
in
a
successful
effort
to
rescue
a
baby
sister
he
had
fallen
headforemost
into
a
great
wood
fire
and
when
they
picked
him
up
his
face
was
like
unto
a
charred
log
that
had
long
smouldered
almost
the
semblance
of
humanity
had
been
wiped
from
him
and
to
all
beholders
he
became
a
thing
of
horror
men
turned
their
heads
away
women
shivered
and
children
screamed
at
his
approach
he
was
a
pariah
condemned
from
early
boyhood
to
an
awful
loneliness
his
parents
a
certain
sir
julius
wendover
baronet
and
his
wife
his
elder
brother
and
his
sisters
they
must
have
been
a
compassionless
family
turned
from
him
as
from
an
evil
and
pestilential
thing
love
never
touched
him
with
its
consoling
feather
and
for
love
the
poor
wretch
pined
his
whole
youth
long
human
companionship
even
was
denied
him
he
seems
to
have
lived
alone
in
a
wing
of
a
great
house
seldom
straying
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
park
under
the
tutorship
of
a
reverend
but
scholarly
sot
who
was
too
drunken
and
obese
and
unbuttoned
to
be
admitted
into
the
family
circle
this
fellow
one
doctor
tubbs
of
college
cambridge
seems
to
have
shown
jeremy
some
semblance
of
affection
but
chiefly
while
in
his
cups
when
as
jeremy
puts
it
bitterly
he
was
too
much
like
unto
the
beasts
that
perish
to
distinguish
between
me
and
a
human
being
when
sober
he
railed
at
the
boy
for
a
monster
and
frequently
chastised
him
for
his
lack
of
beauty
but
in
some
strange
way
in
alternate
fits
of
slobbering
and
castigating
he
managed
to
lay
the
groundwork
of
a
fine
education
teaching
jeremy
the
classics
italian
and
french
some
mathematics
and
the
elements
of
philosophy
and
theology
he
also
discoursed
much
to
him
on
the
great
world
of
which
till
his
misfortunes
came
upon
him
he
boasted
of
having
been
a
distinguished
ornament
and
when
he
had
three
bottles
of
wine
inside
him
he
told
his
charge
very
curious
and
instructive
things
indeed
so
jeremy
grew
to
man
estate
sensitive
shy
living
in
the
world
of
books
and
knowing
little
save
at
of
the
ways
of
men
and
women
but
with
all
the
secrets
of
the
birds
and
beasts
in
the
warwickshire
park
he
was
intimately
acquainted
he
became
part
of
the
woodland
life
squirrels
would
come
to
him
and
munch
their
acorns
on
his
shoulder
so
intimate
was
i
in
this
innocent
community
says
he
not
without
quiet
humour
that
i
have
been
a
to
weasels
and
called
in
as
physician
to
a
family
of
moles
when
sir
julius
died
jeremy
received
his
younger
son
portion
fortunately
it
was
a
goodly
one
and
was
turned
neck
and
crop
out
of
the
house
by
his
brother
tubbs
having
also
suffered
ignominious
expulsion
persuaded
him
to
go
on
the
grand
tour
they
started
but
they
only
got
as
far
as
abbeville
on
the
road
to
paris
where
tubbs
was
struck
down
by
an
apoplexy
of
which
he
died
up
to
that
point
the
sot
company
had
enabled
jeremy
to
endure
the
insult
ribaldry
and
terror
that
attended
his
unspeakable
deformity
but
left
alone
he
lost
heart
mankind
rejected
him
as
a
pack
of
wolves
rejects
a
maimed
cub
stricken
with
shame
and
humiliation
he
crept
back
to
england
and
established
himself
in
the
maltster
house
at
bullingford
guided
thither
by
no
other
consideration
than
that
it
had
been
the
birthplace
of
the
dissolute
tubbs
he
took
up
his
lonely
abode
there
as
a
boy
of
and
there
he
spent
the
long
remainder
of
his
life
iii
the
great
event
happened
in
his
year
you
may
picture
him
as
a
solitary
scholarly
figure
living
in
the
little
tudor
house
with
its
mullioned
windows
set
in
the
midst
of
an
garden
bright
with
stocks
and
phlox
and
hollyhocks
and
great
pink
roses
its
southern
wall
generously
glowing
with
purple
plums
indoors
the
house
was
somewhat
dark
the
casement
window
of
the
main
was
small
and
overshadowed
by
the
heavy
ivy
outside
the
furniture
of
plain
dark
oak
mainly
consisted
of
bookcases
in
which
were
ranged
the
solemn
volumes
that
were
jeremy
world
a
great
table
in
front
of
the
window
contained
the
books
of
the
moment
the
latest
from
london
and
the
great
volume
in
which
he
wrote
his
diary
in
front
of
it
stood
a
great
chair
you
may
picture
him
on
a
late
august
afternoon
sitting
in
this
chair
writing
his
diary
by
the
fading
light
his
wig
lay
on
the
table
for
the
weather
was
close
he
paused
pen
in
hand
and
looked
wistfully
at
the
mellow
eastern
sky
lost
in
thought
then
he
wrote
these
words
lord
jesus
fill
me
plentifully
with
thy
love
which
passeth
the
love
of
woman
for
love
of
woman
never
will
be
mine
and
therefore
o
lord
i
require
thy
love
bountifully
i
yearn
for
love
even
as
a
weaned
child
even
as
a
weaned
child
yearns
for
the
breast
of
its
mother
so
yearn
i
for
he
closed
and
clasped
the
book
with
a
sigh
put
on
his
wig
rose
and
going
into
the
tiny
hall
opened
the
kitchen
door
and
announced
to
his
household
one
ancient
and
incompetent
crone
his
intention
of
taking
the
air
then
he
clapped
on
his
old
hat
and
stick
in
hand
went
out
of
the
front
gate
into
the
light
of
the
sunset
he
stood
for
a
while
watching
the
deep
reflections
of
the
alders
and
willows
in
the
river
and
the
golden
peace
of
the
meadows
beyond
and
his
heart
was
uplifted
in
thankfulness
for
the
beauty
of
the
earth
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
the
stoop
of
the
scholar
and
despite
his
rough
clothes
the
unmistakable
air
of
the
gentleman
the
setting
sun
shone
full
on
the
piteous
medley
of
marred
features
that
served
him
for
a
face
a
woman
sickle
on
arm
leading
a
toddling
child
passed
by
with
averted
head
but
she
curtsied
and
said
respectfully
good
evening
your
honour
the
child
looked
at
him
and
with
a
cry
of
fear
shrank
into
the
mother
skirts
jeremy
touched
his
hat
good
evening
mistress
blackacre
i
trust
your
husband
is
recovered
from
his
fever
thanks
to
your
honour
kindness
said
the
woman
her
eyes
always
turned
from
him
he
is
recovered
for
shame
of
yourself
she
added
shaking
the
child
nay
nay
said
jeremy
kindly
is
not
the
urchin
fault
that
he
met
a
bogey
in
broad
daylight
he
strolled
along
the
river
bank
pleased
at
his
encounter
in
that
little
backwater
of
the
world
where
he
had
lived
secluded
for
ten
years
folks
had
learned
to
suffer
him
nay
more
to
respect
him
and
though
they
seldom
looked
him
in
the
face
their
words
were
gentle
and
friendly
he
could
even
jest
at
his
own
misfortune
god
is
good
he
murmured
as
he
walked
with
head
bent
down
and
hands
behind
his
back
and
the
earth
is
full
of
his
goodness
yet
if
he
in
his
mercy
could
only
give
me
a
companion
in
my
loneliness
as
he
gives
to
every
peasant
bird
and
beast
a
sigh
ended
the
sentence
he
was
young
and
not
always
able
to
control
the
squabble
between
sex
and
piety
the
words
had
scarcely
passed
his
lips
however
when
he
discerned
a
female
figure
seated
on
the
bank
some
fifty
yards
away
his
first
impulse
an
impulse
which
the
habit
of
years
would
on
ordinary
occasions
have
rendered
imperative
was
to
make
a
wide
detour
round
the
meadows
but
this
evening
the
spirit
of
mild
revolt
took
possession
of
him
and
guided
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
lady
for
lady
he
perceived
her
to
be
when
he
drew
a
little
nearer
she
wore
a
flowered
muslin
dress
cut
open
at
the
neck
and
her
arms
bare
to
the
elbows
were
white
and
shapely
a
of
a
face
appeared
below
the
bound
by
a
ribbon
and
as
jeremy
came
within
speaking
distance
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
fearlessly
jeremy
halted
and
looked
at
her
while
she
looked
at
jeremy
his
heart
beat
wildly
the
miracle
of
miracles
had
happened
the
hopeless
impossible
thing
that
he
had
prayed
for
in
rebellious
hours
for
so
many
years
ever
since
he
had
realised
that
the
world
held
such
a
thing
as
the
joy
and
the
blessing
of
woman
love
a
girl
looked
at
him
smilingly
frankly
in
the
face
without
a
quiver
of
repulsion
and
a
girl
more
dainty
and
beautiful
than
any
he
had
seen
before
then
as
he
stared
transfixed
like
a
person
in
a
beatitude
into
her
eyes
something
magical
occurred
to
jeremy
the
air
was
filled
with
the
sound
of
fairy
harps
of
which
his
own
tingling
nerves
from
head
to
foot
were
the
vibrating
strings
jeremy
fell
instantaneously
in
love
will
you
tell
me
sir
she
said
in
a
musical
voice
the
music
of
the
spheres
to
jeremy
will
you
tell
me
how
i
can
reach
the
house
of
mistress
wotherspoon
jeremy
took
off
his
hat
and
made
a
sweeping
bow
why
surely
madam
said
he
pointing
with
his
stick
is
yonder
red
roof
peeping
through
the
trees
only
three
hundred
yards
distant
you
are
a
gentleman
said
the
girl
quickly
my
name
is
jeremy
wendover
younger
son
of
the
late
sir
julius
wendover
baronet
and
now
and
always
madam
your
very
humble
servant
she
smiled
her
rosy
lips
and
pearly
teeth
jeremy
own
description
filled
jeremy
head
with
lunatic
imaginings
and
i
sir
said
she
am
mistress
barbara
seaforth
and
i
came
but
yesterday
to
stay
with
my
aunt
mistress
wotherspoon
if
i
could
trespass
so
far
on
your
courtesy
as
to
pray
you
to
conduct
me
thither
i
should
be
vastly
beholden
to
you
his
sudden
delight
at
the
proposition
was
mingled
with
some
astonishment
she
only
had
to
walk
across
the
open
meadow
to
the
clump
of
trees
he
assisted
her
to
rise
and
with
elaborate
politeness
offered
his
arm
she
made
no
motion
however
to
take
it
i
thought
i
was
walking
in
my
aunt
little
railed
enclosure
she
remarked
but
i
must
have
passed
through
the
gate
into
the
open
fields
and
when
i
came
to
the
river
i
was
frightened
and
sat
down
and
waited
for
someone
to
pass
pray
pardon
me
madam
said
jeremy
but
i
do
quite
understand
la
sir
how
very
thoughtless
of
me
she
laughed
i
never
told
you
i
am
blind
blind
he
echoed
the
leaden
weight
of
a
piteous
dismay
fell
upon
him
that
was
why
she
had
gazed
at
him
so
fearlessly
she
had
not
seen
him
the
miracle
had
not
happened
for
a
moment
he
lost
count
of
the
girl
sad
affliction
in
the
stress
of
his
own
bitterness
but
the
lifelong
habit
of
resignation
prevailed
madam
i
crave
your
pardon
for
not
having
noticed
it
he
said
in
an
unsteady
voice
and
i
admire
the
fortitude
wherewith
you
bear
so
grievous
a
burden
just
because
i
ca
see
is
no
reason
for
my
drowning
the
world
in
my
tears
we
must
make
the
best
of
things
and
there
are
compensations
too
she
added
lightly
allowing
her
hand
to
be
placed
on
his
arm
and
led
away
i
refer
to
an
adventure
with
a
young
gentleman
which
were
i
not
blind
my
aunt
wotherspoon
would
esteem
mightily
unbecoming
alas
madam
said
he
with
a
sigh
there
you
are
wrong
i
am
not
young
i
am
he
thought
it
was
a
great
age
mistress
barbara
turned
up
her
face
saucily
and
laughed
evidently
she
did
not
share
his
opinion
jeremy
bent
a
wistful
gaze
into
the
beautiful
sightless
eyes
and
then
saw
what
had
hitherto
escaped
his
notice
a
thin
grey
film
over
the
pupils
how
did
you
know
he
asked
that
i
was
a
man
when
i
came
up
to
you
first
by
your
aged
tottering
footsteps
sir
she
said
with
a
pretty
air
of
mockery
which
were
not
those
of
a
young
girl
and
then
you
were
standing
me
and
the
sun
and
one
of
my
poor
eyes
can
still
distinguish
light
from
shadow
how
long
have
you
suffered
from
this
great
affliction
he
asked
i
have
been
going
blind
for
two
years
it
is
now
two
months
since
i
have
lost
sight
altogether
but
please
do
talk
of
it
she
added
hastily
if
you
pity
me
i
shall
cry
which
i
hate
for
i
want
to
laugh
as
much
as
i
can
i
can
also
walk
faster
sir
if
it
would
not
tire
your
aged
limbs
jeremy
started
guiltily
she
had
divined
his
evil
purpose
but
who
will
blame
him
for
not
wishing
to
relinquish
oversoon
the
delicious
pressure
of
her
little
hand
on
his
arm
and
to
give
over
this
blind
flower
of
womanhood
into
another
charge
he
replied
disingenuously
without
quickening
his
pace
is
for
your
sake
madam
i
am
walking
slowly
the
afternoon
is
warm
i
am
vastly
sensible
of
your
gallantry
sir
she
retorted
but
i
fear
you
must
have
practised
it
much
on
others
to
have
arrived
at
this
perfection
by
heavens
madam
he
cried
cut
to
the
heart
by
her
innocent
raillery
is
not
so
could
you
but
see
me
you
would
know
it
was
not
i
am
a
recluse
a
student
a
poor
creature
set
apart
from
the
ways
of
men
you
are
the
first
woman
that
has
walked
with
me
in
all
my
life
except
in
dreams
and
now
my
dream
has
come
true
his
voice
vibrated
and
when
she
answered
hers
was
responsive
you
too
have
your
burden
could
you
but
know
how
your
touch
lightens
it
said
he
she
blushed
to
the
brown
hair
that
was
visible
beneath
the
are
we
very
far
now
from
my
aunt
wotherspoon
she
asked
whereupon
jeremy
abashed
took
refuge
in
the
commonplace
the
open
gate
through
which
she
had
strayed
was
reached
all
too
quickly
when
she
had
passed
through
she
made
him
a
curtsey
and
held
out
her
hand
he
touched
it
with
his
lips
as
if
it
were
sacramental
bread
she
avowed
herself
much
beholden
to
his
kindness
shall
i
ever
see
you
again
mistress
barbara
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
for
an
old
servant
was
hobbling
down
from
the
house
to
meet
her
my
aunt
wotherspoon
is
and
receives
no
visitors
but
i
could
be
of
no
further
service
to
you
pleaded
jeremy
she
hesitated
and
then
she
said
demurely
it
would
be
a
humane
action
sir
to
see
sometimes
that
this
gate
is
shut
lest
i
stray
through
it
again
and
drown
myself
in
the
river
jeremy
could
scarce
believe
his
ears
iv
this
was
the
beginning
of
jeremy
he
guarded
the
gate
like
cerberus
or
saint
peter
sometimes
at
dawn
he
would
creep
out
of
his
house
and
tramp
through
the
meadows
to
see
that
it
was
safely
shut
during
the
day
he
would
do
within
sight
of
the
sacred
portal
and
when
the
flutter
of
a
and
a
flowered
muslin
met
his
eye
he
would
advance
merely
to
report
that
the
owner
ran
no
danger
and
then
one
day
she
bade
him
open
it
and
she
came
forth
and
they
walked
in
the
meadows
and
this
grew
to
be
a
daily
custom
to
the
no
small
scandal
of
the
neighbourhood
very
soon
jeremy
learned
her
simple
history
she
was
an
orphan
with
a
small
competence
of
her
own
till
recently
she
had
lived
in
somersetshire
with
her
guardian
but
now
he
was
dead
and
the
only
home
she
could
turn
to
was
that
of
her
aunt
wotherspoon
her
sole
surviving
relative
jeremy
with
a
lamentable
lack
of
universality
thanked
god
on
his
knees
for
his
great
mercy
if
mistress
wotherspoon
had
not
been
confined
to
her
bed
she
would
not
have
allowed
her
niece
to
wander
at
will
with
a
notorious
scarecrow
over
the
bullingford
meadows
and
if
barbara
had
not
been
blind
she
could
not
have
walked
happily
in
his
company
and
hung
trustfully
on
his
arm
for
days
she
was
but
a
wonder
and
a
wild
desire
her
beauty
her
laughter
her
wit
her
simplicity
her
bravery
bewildered
him
it
was
enough
to
hear
the
music
of
her
voice
to
feel
the
fragrance
of
her
presence
to
thrill
at
her
light
touch
he
jeremy
wendover
from
whose
distortion
all
human
beings
his
life
long
had
turned
shuddering
away
to
have
this
ineffable
companionship
it
transcended
thought
at
last
it
was
one
night
as
he
lay
awake
remembering
how
they
had
walked
that
afternoon
not
but
the
amazing
dazzling
glory
of
a
possibility
enveloped
him
she
was
blind
she
could
never
see
his
deformity
had
god
listened
to
his
prayer
and
delivered
this
fair
and
beloved
woman
into
his
keeping
he
shivered
all
night
long
in
an
ecstasy
of
happiness
rose
at
dawn
and
mounted
guard
at
barbara
gate
but
as
he
waited
foodless
for
the
thrilling
sight
of
her
depression
came
and
sat
heavy
on
his
shoulders
until
he
felt
that
in
daring
to
think
of
her
in
the
way
of
marriage
he
was
committing
an
abominable
crime
when
she
came
fresh
as
the
morning
bareheaded
her
beautiful
hair
done
up
in
a
club
behind
into
the
little
field
and
he
tried
to
call
to
her
his
tongue
was
dry
and
he
could
utter
no
sound
accidentally
he
dropped
his
stick
which
clattered
down
the
bars
of
the
gate
she
laughed
he
entered
the
enclosure
i
knew
i
should
find
you
there
she
cried
and
sped
toward
him
how
did
you
know
he
asked
the
pricking
of
my
thumb
she
quoted
gaily
and
then
as
he
took
both
her
outstretched
hands
she
drew
near
him
and
whispered
and
by
the
beating
of
my
heart
his
arms
folded
around
her
and
he
held
her
tight
against
him
stupefied
dazed
throbbing
vainly
trying
to
find
words
at
last
he
said
huskily
god
has
sent
you
to
be
the
joy
and
comfort
of
a
sorely
stricken
man
i
accept
it
because
it
is
his
will
i
will
cherish
you
as
no
man
has
ever
cherished
woman
before
my
love
for
you
my
dear
is
as
infinite
as
infinite
oh
god
speech
failed
him
he
tore
his
arms
away
from
her
and
fell
sobbing
at
her
feet
and
kissed
the
skirts
of
her
gown
v
the
divine
mercy
as
jeremy
puts
it
thought
fit
to
remove
aunt
wotherspoon
to
a
happier
world
before
the
week
was
out
and
so
within
a
month
jeremy
led
his
blind
bride
into
the
little
tudor
house
and
then
began
for
him
a
happiness
so
exquisite
that
sometimes
he
was
afraid
to
breathe
lest
he
should
disturb
the
enchanted
air
every
germ
of
love
and
tenderness
that
had
lain
undeveloped
in
his
nature
sprang
into
flower
sometimes
he
grew
afraid
lest
in
loving
her
he
was
forgetting
god
but
he
reassured
himself
by
a
pretty
sophistry
o
lord
says
he
it
is
thou
only
that
i
worship
through
thine
own
great
gift
and
indeed
what
more
could
be
desired
by
a
reasonable
deity
barbara
responsive
gave
him
her
love
in
full
from
the
first
she
would
hear
nothing
of
his
maimed
visage
my
dear
she
said
as
they
wandered
one
golden
autumn
day
by
the
riverside
i
have
made
a
picture
of
you
out
of
your
voice
the
plash
of
water
the
sunset
and
the
summer
air
was
thus
that
my
heart
saw
you
the
first
evening
we
met
and
that
is
more
than
sufficing
for
a
poor
blind
creature
whom
a
gallant
gentleman
married
out
of
charity
charity
his
voice
rose
in
indignant
repudiation
she
laughed
and
laid
her
head
on
her
shoulder
ah
dear
i
did
but
jest
i
know
you
fell
in
love
with
my
pretty
doll
face
and
also
with
a
little
mocking
spirit
of
my
own
but
what
made
you
fall
in
love
with
me
faith
wendover
she
replied
a
woman
with
eyes
in
her
head
has
but
to
go
whither
she
is
driven
and
so
much
the
more
a
blind
female
like
me
you
led
me
plump
into
the
middle
of
the
morass
and
when
you
came
and
rescued
me
i
was
silly
enough
to
be
grateful
under
jeremy
love
her
rich
nature
expanded
day
by
day
she
set
her
joyous
courage
and
her
wit
to
work
to
laugh
at
blindness
and
to
make
her
the
practical
serviceable
housewife
as
well
as
the
gay
companion
the
ancient
crone
was
replaced
by
a
brisk
servant
and
a
gardener
and
jeremy
enjoyed
creature
comforts
undreamed
of
and
the
months
sped
happily
by
autumn
darkened
into
winter
and
winter
cleared
into
spring
and
daffodils
and
crocuses
and
primroses
began
to
show
themselves
in
corners
of
the
garden
and
tiny
gossamer
garments
in
corners
of
the
dark
old
house
then
a
newer
deeper
happiness
enfolded
them
but
there
came
a
twilight
hour
when
whispering
of
the
wonder
that
was
to
come
she
suddenly
began
to
cry
softly
but
why
why
dear
he
asked
in
tender
astonishment
only
only
to
think
jeremy
that
i
shall
never
see
it
vi
one
evening
in
april
while
jeremy
was
reading
and
barbara
sewing
in
the
little
parlour
almost
simultaneously
with
a
sudden
downpour
of
rain
came
a
knock
at
the
front
door
jeremy
startled
by
this
unwonted
occurrence
went
himself
to
answer
the
summons
and
opening
the
door
was
confronted
by
a
stout
youngish
man
dressed
in
black
with
elegant
ruffles
and
a
cane
your
pardon
sir
said
the
but
may
i
crave
a
shelter
during
this
shower
i
am
scarce
equipped
for
the
elements
pray
enter
said
jeremy
hospitably
i
am
from
london
and
lodging
at
the
hart
at
bullingford
for
the
night
the
stranger
explained
shaking
the
raindrops
from
his
hat
during
a
stroll
before
supper
i
lost
my
way
and
this
storm
has
surprised
me
at
your
gate
i
make
a
thousand
apologies
for
deranging
you
if
you
are
wet
the
parlour
fire
will
dry
you
i
beg
you
sir
to
follow
me
said
jeremy
he
led
the
way
through
the
dark
passage
and
pausing
with
his
hand
on
the
turned
to
the
stranger
and
said
with
his
grave
courtesy
i
think
it
right
to
warn
you
sir
that
i
am
afflicted
with
a
certain
personal
disfigurement
which
not
all
persons
can
look
upon
with
equanimity
sir
replied
the
other
my
name
is
john
hattaway
surgeon
at
thomas
hospital
in
london
and
i
am
used
to
regard
with
equanimity
all
forms
of
human
affliction
hattaway
was
shown
into
the
parlour
and
introduced
in
due
form
to
barbara
a
chair
was
set
for
him
near
the
fire
in
the
talk
that
followed
he
showed
himself
to
be
a
man
of
parts
and
education
he
was
on
his
way
he
said
to
oxford
to
perform
an
operation
on
the
warden
of
merton
college
what
kind
of
operation
asked
barbara
his
quick
keen
eyes
swept
her
like
a
searchlight
madam
said
he
not
committing
himself
is
but
a
slight
one
but
when
barbara
had
left
the
room
to
mull
some
claret
for
her
guest
hattaway
turned
to
jeremy
is
a
cataract
said
he
i
am
about
to
remove
from
the
eye
of
the
warden
of
merton
by
the
new
operation
invented
by
my
revered
master
william
cheselden
my
immediate
predecessor
at
thomas
i
did
not
tell
your
wife
for
certain
reasons
but
i
noticed
that
she
is
blinded
by
the
same
disease
jeremy
rose
from
his
chair
do
you
mean
that
you
will
restore
the
warden
sight
i
have
every
hope
of
doing
so
but
if
his
sight
can
be
restored
then
my
wife
can
be
restored
also
said
the
surgeon
complacently
jeremy
sat
down
feeling
faint
and
dizzy
did
you
not
know
that
cataract
was
curable
i
am
scholar
enough
answered
jeremy
to
have
read
that
king
john
of
aragon
was
so
cured
by
the
jew
abiathar
of
lerida
by
means
of
a
needle
thrust
through
the
eyeball
barbarous
my
dear
sir
barbarous
cried
the
surgeon
raising
a
white
protesting
hand
one
in
a
million
may
be
so
cured
there
is
even
now
a
pestilential
fellow
of
a
quack
calling
himself
the
chevalier
taylor
who
is
prodding
folks
eyes
with
a
skewer
have
you
never
heard
of
him
alas
sir
said
jeremy
i
live
so
out
of
the
world
and
my
daily
converse
is
limited
to
my
dear
wife
and
the
parson
hard
by
who
is
as
recluse
a
scholar
as
i
am
myself
if
you
wish
your
wife
to
regain
her
sight
said
hattaway
avoid
this
chevalier
taylor
like
the
very
devil
but
if
you
will
intrust
her
to
my
care
hattaway
surgeon
of
thomas
hospital
london
pupil
of
the
great
cheselden
he
waved
his
hand
by
way
of
completing
the
unfinished
sentence
when
asked
jeremy
greatly
agitated
after
her
child
is
born
shall
i
tell
her
jeremy
trembled
as
you
will
no
perhaps
you
had
better
wait
a
while
then
barbara
entered
bearing
a
silver
tray
with
the
mulled
claret
and
glasses
proud
of
her
blind
surety
of
movement
hattaway
sprang
to
assist
her
and
unknown
to
her
took
the
opportunity
of
scrutinising
her
eyes
then
he
nodded
confidently
at
jeremy
vii
from
that
evening
jeremy
martyrdom
began
hitherto
he
had
regarded
the
blindness
of
his
wife
as
a
special
dispensation
of
divine
providence
she
had
not
seen
him
save
on
that
first
afternoon
as
a
shadowy
mass
and
had
formed
no
conception
of
his
disfigurement
beyond
the
vague
impression
conveyed
to
her
by
loving
fingers
touching
his
face
she
had
made
her
own
mental
picture
of
him
as
she
had
said
and
whatever
it
was
so
far
from
repelling
her
it
pleased
her
mightily
her
ignorance
indeed
was
bliss
for
both
of
them
and
now
thought
poor
jeremy
knowledge
would
come
with
the
restored
vision
and
like
our
first
parents
they
would
be
driven
out
of
eden
sometimes
the
devil
entered
his
heart
and
prompted
cowardly
concealment
why
tell
barbara
of
hattaway
proposal
why
disturb
a
happiness
already
so
perfect
all
her
other
senses
were
eyes
to
her
she
had
grown
almost
unconscious
of
her
affliction
she
was
happier
loving
him
with
blinded
eyes
than
recoiling
from
him
in
horror
with
seeing
ones
it
was
in
sooth
for
her
own
dear
happiness
that
she
should
remain
in
darkness
but
then
jeremy
remembered
the
only
cry
her
brave
soul
had
ever
uttered
and
after
wrestling
long
in
prayer
he
knew
that
the
evil
one
had
spoken
and
in
the
good
way
he
bade
satan
get
behind
him
me
the
words
are
in
his
diary
printed
in
capital
letters
but
one
day
when
she
repeated
her
cry
his
heart
ached
for
her
and
he
comforted
her
with
the
golden
hope
she
wept
tears
of
joy
and
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
and
from
that
day
forth
filled
the
house
with
song
and
laughter
and
the
mirth
of
unbounded
happiness
but
jeremy
though
he
bespoke
her
tenderly
and
hopefully
felt
that
he
had
signed
his
now
and
then
when
her
gay
spirit
danced
through
the
glowing
future
he
was
tempted
to
say
when
you
see
me
as
i
am
your
love
will
turn
to
loathing
and
our
heaven
to
hell
but
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
dash
her
joy
and
she
never
spoke
of
seeing
him
only
of
seeing
the
child
and
the
sun
and
the
flowers
and
the
buttons
of
his
shirts
which
she
vowed
must
seem
to
be
sewed
on
by
a
drunken
cobbler
viii
the
child
was
born
a
boy
strong
and
lusty
to
jeremy
the
incarnation
of
miraculous
wonder
that
the
thing
was
alive
with
legs
and
arms
and
feet
and
hands
and
could
utter
sounds
which
it
did
with
much
vigour
made
demands
almost
too
great
on
his
credulity
what
is
he
like
asked
barbara
this
was
a
poser
for
jeremy
for
the
pink
brat
was
like
nothing
on
earth
save
any
other
newborn
infant
i
think
he
said
hesitatingly
i
think
he
may
be
said
to
resemble
cupid
he
has
a
mouth
like
cupid
bow
and
cupid
wings
she
laughed
fie
jeremy
i
thought
we
had
born
to
us
a
christian
child
but
that
he
has
a
body
said
jeremy
i
should
say
he
was
a
cherub
he
has
eyes
of
a
celestial
blue
and
his
nose
yes
yes
his
nose
came
breathlessly
from
barbara
i
afraid
my
dear
there
is
so
little
of
it
to
judge
by
said
jeremy
before
the
summer
out
i
shall
be
able
to
judge
for
myself
said
barbara
and
terror
gripped
the
man
heart
the
days
passed
and
barbara
rose
from
her
bed
and
again
sang
and
laughed
see
i
am
strong
enough
to
withstand
any
operation
she
declared
one
day
holding
out
the
babe
at
arm
length
not
yet
said
jeremy
not
yet
the
child
needs
you
the
child
was
asleep
she
felt
with
her
foot
for
its
cradle
and
with
marvellous
certainty
deposited
him
gently
in
the
nest
and
covered
him
with
the
tiny
coverlet
then
she
turned
to
jeremy
my
husband
do
you
wish
me
to
have
my
sight
restored
how
can
you
doubt
it
he
cried
i
would
have
you
undergo
this
operation
were
my
life
the
fee
she
came
close
to
him
and
put
her
hands
about
his
maimed
face
dear
she
said
do
you
think
anything
could
change
my
love
for
you
it
was
the
first
hint
that
she
had
divined
his
fears
but
he
remained
silent
every
fibre
of
his
being
shrinking
from
the
monstrous
argument
for
answer
he
kissed
her
hands
as
she
withdrew
them
at
last
the
time
came
for
the
great
adventure
letters
passed
between
jeremy
and
hattaway
of
thomas
hospital
who
engaged
lodgings
in
cork
street
so
that
they
should
be
near
his
own
residence
in
bond
street
hard
by
a
great
travelling
chariot
and
were
hired
from
bullingford
two
great
which
jeremy
had
never
fired
off
in
his
life
were
loaded
and
primed
and
put
in
the
holsters
and
one
morning
in
early
august
jeremy
and
barbara
and
the
nurse
and
the
baby
started
on
their
perilous
journey
they
lay
at
reading
that
night
and
arrived
without
misadventure
at
cork
street
on
the
following
afternoon
hattaway
called
in
the
evening
with
two
lean
and
solemn
young
men
his
apprentices
for
even
the
great
hattaway
was
but
a
practising
a
trade
under
the
control
of
a
city
guild
and
made
his
preparations
for
the
morrow
in
these
days
of
anæsthetics
and
cocaine
sterilised
instruments
trained
nurses
and
scientific
ventilation
it
is
almost
impossible
to
realise
the
conditions
under
which
surgical
operations
were
conducted
in
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
yet
they
occasionally
were
successful
and
patients
sometimes
did
survive
and
nobody
complained
thinking
like
barbara
wendover
that
all
was
for
the
best
in
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
for
as
she
lay
in
the
close
darkened
room
the
next
day
after
the
operation
was
over
tended
by
a
chattering
beldame
of
a
midwife
she
took
the
burning
pain
in
her
bandaged
eyes
after
the
fashion
of
the
time
hattaway
had
operated
on
both
at
once
as
part
of
the
cure
and
thanked
god
she
was
born
into
so
marvellous
an
epoch
then
jeremy
came
and
sat
by
her
bed
and
held
her
hand
and
she
was
very
happy
but
jeremy
then
and
in
the
slow
torturing
days
that
followed
went
about
shrunken
like
a
man
doomed
to
worse
than
death
london
increased
his
agony
at
first
a
natural
curiosity
for
he
had
passed
through
the
town
but
twice
before
once
as
he
set
out
for
the
grand
tour
with
doctor
tubbs
and
once
on
his
return
thence
and
a
countryman
craving
for
air
took
him
out
into
the
busy
streets
but
he
found
the
behaviour
of
the
populace
far
different
from
that
of
the
inhabitants
of
bullingford
who
passed
him
by
respectfully
though
with
averted
faces
porters
and
lackeys
openly
jeered
at
him
ragged
children
summoned
their
congeners
and
followed
hooting
in
his
train
it
was
a
cruel
age
and
elegant
gentlemen
in
flowered
silk
coats
and
lace
ruffles
had
no
compunction
in
holding
their
cambric
handkerchiefs
before
their
eyes
and
vowing
within
his
hearing
that
stab
their
vitals
such
a
fellow
should
wear
a
mask
or
be
put
into
the
royal
society
museum
and
in
james
street
one
fine
lady
stepping
out
of
her
almost
into
his
arms
fell
back
shrieking
that
she
had
seen
a
monster
and
pretended
to
faint
as
the
obsequious
staymaker
ran
out
of
his
shop
to
her
assistance
he
ceased
to
go
abroad
in
daylight
and
only
crept
about
the
streets
at
night
even
then
nervously
avoiding
the
glare
of
a
torch
desperate
thoughts
came
to
him
during
these
gloomy
rambles
fear
of
god
alone
as
is
evident
from
the
diary
prevented
him
from
taking
his
life
and
the
poor
wretch
prayed
for
he
knew
not
what
ix
one
morning
hattaway
after
his
examination
of
the
patient
entered
the
parlour
where
jeremy
was
reading
there
were
the
fourteen
volumes
of
them
in
the
room
unlively
bookcase
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
an
air
of
importance
sir
said
he
i
bring
you
good
news
jeremy
closed
his
book
she
sees
on
removing
the
bandages
just
now
replied
hattaway
i
perceived
to
my
great
regret
that
with
the
left
eye
my
skill
has
been
unavailing
the
failure
is
due
i
believe
to
an
injury
to
the
retina
which
i
have
been
unable
to
discover
he
paused
and
took
snuff
but
i
rejoice
to
inform
you
that
sight
is
restored
to
the
right
eye
i
admitted
light
into
the
room
and
though
the
vision
is
diffused
which
a
lens
will
rectify
she
saw
me
distinctly
thank
god
she
has
the
blessing
of
sight
said
jeremy
reverently
amen
said
the
surgeon
he
took
another
pinch
also
perhaps
thank
your
humble
servant
for
restoring
it
i
owe
you
an
unpayable
debt
replied
jeremy
she
is
crying
out
for
the
baby
said
hattaway
if
you
will
kindly
send
it
in
to
her
i
can
allow
her
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
it
before
i
complete
the
rebandaging
for
the
day
jeremy
rang
the
bell
and
gave
the
order
and
i
he
inquired
bravely
the
surgeon
hesitated
and
scratched
his
plump
cheek
you
know
that
my
wife
has
never
seen
me
then
said
hattaway
the
nurse
and
child
appeared
at
the
doorway
and
the
surgeon
followed
them
into
barbara
room
when
the
surgeon
had
left
the
house
jeremy
went
to
barbara
and
found
her
crooning
over
the
babe
which
lay
in
her
arms
i
seen
him
dear
i
seen
him
she
cried
joyously
he
is
the
most
wonderfully
beautiful
thing
on
the
earth
his
eyes
are
light
blue
and
mine
are
dark
so
he
must
have
yours
and
his
mouth
is
made
for
kisses
and
his
expression
is
that
of
a
babe
born
in
paradise
jeremy
bent
over
and
looked
at
the
boy
who
sniggered
at
him
in
a
most
unparadisiacal
fashion
and
they
talked
parentwise
over
his
perfections
before
we
go
back
to
bullingford
you
will
let
me
take
a
coach
jeremy
and
drive
about
the
streets
and
show
him
to
the
town
i
will
hold
him
up
and
cry
and
gentlemen
look
is
the
tenth
wonder
of
the
world
you
only
have
this
one
chance
of
seeing
him
she
rattled
on
in
the
gayest
of
moods
making
him
laugh
in
spite
of
the
terror
the
failure
of
the
operation
in
the
left
eye
she
put
aside
as
of
no
account
one
eye
was
a
necessity
but
two
were
a
mere
luxury
and
it
is
the
little
rogue
that
will
reap
the
benefit
she
cried
cuddling
the
child
for
when
he
is
naughty
mammy
will
turn
the
blind
side
of
her
face
to
him
and
will
you
turn
the
blind
side
of
your
face
to
me
asked
jeremy
with
a
quiver
of
the
lips
she
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
against
her
cheek
you
have
no
faults
my
beloved
husband
for
me
to
be
blind
to
she
said
wilfully
or
not
misunderstanding
him
such
rapture
had
the
sight
of
the
child
given
her
that
she
insisted
on
its
lying
with
her
that
night
a
being
placed
in
the
room
for
the
child
nurse
when
jeremy
took
leave
of
her
before
going
to
his
own
room
he
bent
over
her
and
whispered
her
sweet
lips
pathetically
sweet
below
the
bandage
parted
in
a
smile
and
they
never
seemed
sweeter
to
the
anguished
man
and
she
also
whispered
and
kissed
him
he
went
away
and
as
he
closed
the
door
he
felt
that
it
was
the
gate
of
paradise
shut
against
him
for
ever
he
did
not
sleep
that
night
but
spent
it
as
a
brave
man
spends
the
night
before
his
execution
for
after
all
jeremy
wendover
was
a
gallant
gentlemen
in
the
morning
he
went
into
barbara
room
before
breakfast
as
his
custom
was
and
found
her
still
gay
and
bubbling
over
with
the
joy
of
life
and
when
he
was
leaving
her
she
stretched
out
her
hands
and
clasped
his
maimed
face
as
she
had
done
once
before
and
said
the
same
reassuring
words
nothing
could
shake
her
immense
her
steadfast
love
but
jeremy
entering
the
parlour
and
catching
sight
of
himself
in
the
queen
anne
mirror
over
the
shuddered
to
the
inmost
roots
of
his
being
she
had
no
conception
of
what
she
vowed
he
was
scarce
through
breakfast
when
hattaway
entered
a
full
hour
before
his
usual
time
i
am
in
a
prodigious
hurry
said
he
for
i
must
go
into
norfolk
to
operate
on
my
lord
winteringham
for
the
stone
i
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
so
i
pray
you
to
accompany
me
to
your
bedchamber
the
awful
moment
had
come
jeremy
courteously
opened
doors
for
the
surgeon
to
pass
through
and
followed
with
death
in
his
heart
when
they
entered
the
room
he
noticed
that
barbara
had
caused
the
to
be
removed
and
that
she
was
lying
demure
as
a
nun
in
a
newly
made
bed
the
surgeon
flung
the
black
curtains
from
the
window
and
let
the
summer
light
filter
through
the
linen
blinds
we
will
have
a
longer
exposure
this
morning
said
he
and
a
little
longer
still
and
so
on
until
we
can
face
the
daylight
altogether
now
madam
if
you
please
he
busied
himself
with
the
bandages
jeremy
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
stood
clasping
barbara
hand
stood
with
thumping
heart
holding
his
breath
setting
his
teeth
nerving
himself
for
the
sharp
instinctive
gasp
the
reflex
recoil
that
he
knew
would
be
the
death
sentence
of
their
love
and
at
that
supreme
moment
he
cursed
himself
bitterly
for
a
fool
for
not
having
told
her
of
his
terror
for
not
having
sufficiently
prepared
her
for
the
devastating
revelation
but
now
it
was
too
late
the
bandages
were
removed
the
surgeon
bent
down
and
peered
into
the
eyes
he
started
back
in
dismay
before
her
right
eye
he
rapidly
waved
his
finger
do
you
see
that
no
said
barbara
my
god
madam
cried
he
with
a
stricken
look
on
his
plump
face
what
in
the
devil
name
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
great
drops
of
sweat
stood
on
jeremy
brow
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
she
ca
see
the
eye
is
injured
yesterday
save
for
the
crystalline
lens
which
i
extracted
it
was
as
sound
as
mine
or
yours
i
was
afraid
something
had
happened
said
barbara
in
a
tone
baby
was
restive
in
the
night
and
pushed
his
little
fist
into
my
eye
good
heavens
madam
exclaimed
the
angry
surgeon
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
took
a
young
baby
to
sleep
with
you
in
your
condition
barbara
nodded
as
if
found
out
in
a
trifling
peccadillo
i
suppose
i
blind
for
ever
she
asked
casually
he
examined
the
eye
again
there
was
a
moment
dead
silence
jeremy
and
haggard
hung
on
the
verdict
then
hattaway
rose
extended
his
arms
and
let
them
drop
helplessly
against
his
sides
yes
said
he
the
sight
is
gone
jeremy
put
his
hands
to
his
head
staggered
and
overcome
by
the
reaction
from
the
terror
and
the
shock
of
the
calamity
fell
in
a
faint
on
the
floor
after
he
had
recovered
and
the
surgeon
had
gone
promising
to
send
his
apprentice
the
next
day
to
dress
the
eyes
which
for
fear
of
inflammation
still
needed
tending
jeremy
sat
by
his
wife
bedside
with
an
aching
heart
is
the
will
of
god
said
he
gloomily
we
must
not
rebel
against
his
decrees
but
you
dear
foolish
husband
she
cried
half
laughing
who
wants
to
rebel
against
them
not
i
of
a
certainty
i
am
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
is
but
to
comfort
me
that
you
say
it
said
jeremy
is
the
truth
listen
she
sought
for
his
hand
and
continued
with
sweet
seriousness
i
was
selfish
to
want
to
regain
my
sight
but
my
soul
hungered
to
see
my
babe
and
now
that
i
have
seen
him
i
care
not
just
that
one
little
peep
into
the
heaven
of
his
face
was
all
i
wanted
and
was
the
darling
wretch
himself
who
settled
that
i
should
not
have
more
after
a
little
she
said
come
nearer
to
me
and
she
drew
his
ear
to
her
lips
and
whispered
although
i
have
not
regained
my
sight
on
the
other
hand
i
have
not
lost
a
thing
far
dearer
the
face
that
i
love
which
i
made
up
of
your
voice
and
the
plash
of
water
and
the
sunset
and
the
summer
air
she
kissed
him
my
poor
husband
how
you
must
have
suffered
and
then
jeremy
knew
the
great
brave
soul
of
that
woman
whom
the
almighty
had
given
him
to
wife
and
as
he
puts
it
in
his
diary
he
did
glorify
god
exceedingly
so
when
barbara
was
able
to
travel
again
jeremy
sent
for
the
great
roomy
chariot
and
the
and
the
and
they
went
back
to
bullingford
where
they
spent
the
remainder
of
their
lives
in
unclouded
felicity
ii
the
conqueror
miss
winifred
goode
sat
in
her
garden
in
the
shade
of
a
clipped
yew
an
unopened
novel
on
her
lap
and
looked
at
the
gabled
front
of
the
tudor
house
that
was
hers
and
had
been
her
family
for
many
generations
in
that
house
duns
hall
in
that
room
beneath
the
southernmost
gable
she
had
been
born
from
that
house
save
for
casual
absences
rarely
exceeding
a
month
in
duration
she
had
never
stirred
all
the
drama
such
as
it
was
of
her
life
had
been
played
in
that
house
in
that
garden
up
and
down
the
parapeted
stone
terrace
walked
the
ghosts
of
all
those
who
had
been
dear
to
her
her
father
a
vague
but
cherished
memory
a
brother
and
a
sister
who
had
died
during
her
childhood
her
mother
dead
three
years
since
to
whose
invalid
and
somewhat
selfish
needs
she
had
devoted
all
her
full
young
womanhood
another
ghost
walked
there
too
but
that
was
the
ghost
of
the
living
a
young
man
who
had
kissed
and
ridden
away
twenty
years
ago
he
had
kissed
her
over
there
under
the
old
wistaria
arbour
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
what
particular
meaning
he
had
put
into
the
kiss
loverly
brotherly
cousinly
friendly
for
they
had
played
together
all
their
young
lives
and
were
distantly
connected
she
had
never
been
able
to
determine
in
spite
of
his
joy
at
leaving
the
lethargic
country
town
of
dunsfield
for
america
their
parting
had
been
sad
and
sentimental
the
kiss
at
any
rate
had
been
on
his
side
one
of
sincere
affection
an
affection
proven
afterwards
by
a
correspondence
of
twenty
years
to
her
the
kiss
had
been
well
the
one
and
only
kiss
of
her
life
and
she
had
treasured
it
in
a
neat
little
sacred
casket
in
her
heart
since
that
day
no
man
had
ever
showed
an
inclination
to
kiss
her
which
in
one
way
was
strange
as
she
had
been
pretty
and
gentle
and
qualities
attractive
to
youths
in
search
of
a
mate
but
in
another
way
it
was
not
strange
as
youths
are
rare
as
angels
in
dunsfield
beyond
whose
limits
miss
goode
had
seldom
strayed
her
romance
had
been
one
kiss
the
girlish
dreams
of
one
man
at
first
when
he
had
gone
in
america
she
had
fancied
herself
but
time
had
soon
touched
her
with
healing
fingers
of
late
freed
from
the
slavery
of
a
querulous
bedside
she
had
grown
in
love
with
her
unruffled
and
delicately
ordered
existence
in
which
the
only
irregular
things
were
her
herbaceous
borders
between
which
she
walked
like
a
prim
among
a
crowd
of
bright
but
unruly
children
she
had
asked
nothing
more
from
life
than
what
she
had
her
little
duties
in
the
parish
her
little
pleasures
in
the
neighbourhood
her
good
health
her
old
house
her
trim
lawns
her
garden
her
black
cocker
spaniels
as
it
was
at
forty
she
thought
so
should
it
be
till
the
day
of
her
death
but
a
month
ago
had
come
turmoil
roger
orme
announced
his
return
in
america
had
tired
him
he
was
coming
home
to
settle
down
for
good
in
dunsfield
in
the
house
of
his
fathers
this
was
duns
lodge
whose
forty
acres
marched
with
the
two
hundred
acres
of
duns
hall
the
two
places
were
known
in
the
district
as
the
lodge
and
the
hall
about
a
century
since
a
younger
son
of
the
hall
had
married
a
daughter
of
the
lodge
whence
the
remote
tie
of
consanguinity
between
winifred
goode
and
roger
orme
the
lodge
had
been
let
on
lease
for
many
years
but
now
the
lease
had
fallen
in
and
the
tenants
gone
roger
had
arrived
in
england
yesterday
a
telegram
had
bidden
her
expect
him
that
afternoon
she
sat
in
the
garden
expecting
him
and
stared
wistfully
at
the
old
grey
house
a
curious
fear
in
her
eyes
perhaps
if
freakish
chance
had
not
brought
donovan
to
dunsfield
on
a
visit
to
the
rector
a
day
or
two
after
roger
letter
fear
foolish
shameful
sickening
fear
might
not
have
had
so
dominant
a
place
in
her
anticipation
of
his
homecoming
donovan
was
a
contemporary
a
dunsfield
girl
who
had
married
at
nineteen
and
gone
out
with
her
husband
to
india
winifred
goode
remembered
a
gipsy
beauty
riotous
in
the
bloom
of
youth
in
the
rector
she
met
a
shrivelled
caricature
and
she
looked
in
the
woman
face
as
in
a
mirror
of
awful
truth
in
which
she
herself
was
reflected
from
that
moment
she
had
known
no
peace
gone
was
her
placid
acceptance
of
the
footprints
of
the
years
gone
her
pride
in
dainty
dress
she
had
mixed
little
with
the
modern
world
and
held
to
prejudices
which
prescribed
the
outward
demeanour
appropriate
to
each
decade
one
of
her
earliest
memories
was
a
homely
saying
of
her
father
which
had
puzzled
her
childish
mind
considerably
as
to
the
absurdity
of
sheep
being
dressed
lamb
fashion
later
she
understood
and
cordially
agreed
with
the
dictum
the
countess
of
ingleswood
the
personage
of
those
latitudes
at
the
age
of
fifty
showed
the
fluffy
golden
hair
and
cheeks
and
supple
figure
of
twenty
she
wore
bright
colours
and
dashing
hats
and
danced
and
flirted
and
kept
a
of
adoring
young
men
winifred
visited
with
lady
ingleswood
because
she
believed
that
in
these
democratic
days
it
was
the
duty
of
county
families
to
outmatch
the
proletariat
in
solidarity
but
with
every
protest
of
her
gentlewoman
soul
she
disapproved
of
lady
ingleswood
yet
now
to
her
appalling
dismay
she
saw
that
with
the
aid
of
paint
powder
and
peroxide
lady
ingleswood
had
managed
to
keep
young
for
thirty
years
to
winifred
certain
knowledge
she
had
not
altered
the
blasting
hand
that
had
swept
over
madge
donovan
face
had
passed
her
by
winifred
envied
the
woman
power
of
attraction
she
read
with
a
curious
interest
hitherto
disregarded
advertisements
they
were
so
alluring
they
seemed
so
convincing
such
a
cosmetic
used
by
queens
of
song
and
beauty
restored
the
roses
of
girlhood
under
such
a
treatment
wrinkles
disappeared
within
a
week
there
were
the
photographs
to
prove
it
all
over
london
bubbled
fountains
of
youth
at
a
mere
guinea
or
so
a
dip
she
sent
for
a
little
battery
of
washes
and
powders
and
when
it
arrived
she
locked
herself
in
her
bedroom
but
the
sight
of
the
first
unaccustomed
and
unskilfully
applied
dab
of
rouge
on
her
cheek
terrified
her
she
realised
what
she
was
doing
no
ten
thousand
times
no
her
her
puritanism
revolted
she
flew
to
her
and
vigorously
washed
the
offending
bloom
away
with
soap
and
water
she
would
appear
before
the
man
she
loved
just
as
she
was
if
need
be
in
the
withered
truth
of
a
madge
donovan
and
after
all
had
her
beauty
faded
so
utterly
her
glass
said
no
but
her
glass
mocked
her
for
how
could
she
conjure
up
the
young
face
of
twenty
which
roger
orme
carried
in
his
mind
and
compare
it
with
the
present
image
she
sat
in
the
garden
this
blazing
july
afternoon
waiting
for
him
her
heart
beating
with
the
love
of
years
ago
and
the
shrinking
fear
in
her
eyes
presently
she
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
and
she
saw
the
open
fly
of
the
red
lion
dunsfield
chief
hotel
crawling
up
the
drive
and
in
it
was
a
man
wearing
a
straw
hat
she
fluttered
a
timid
handkerchief
but
the
man
not
looking
in
her
direction
did
not
respond
she
crossed
the
lawn
to
the
terrace
feeling
hurt
and
entered
the
by
the
open
french
window
and
stood
there
her
back
to
the
light
soon
he
was
announced
she
went
forward
to
meet
him
my
dear
roger
welcome
home
he
laughed
and
shook
her
hand
in
a
hearty
grip
it
you
winifred
how
good
are
you
glad
to
see
me
back
very
glad
and
i
do
you
find
things
changed
nothing
he
declared
with
a
smile
the
house
is
just
the
same
he
ran
his
fingers
over
the
corner
of
a
louis
xvi
table
near
which
he
was
standing
i
remember
this
table
in
this
exact
spot
twenty
years
ago
and
you
have
scarcely
altered
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
i
should
just
hope
so
said
he
she
realised
with
a
queer
little
pang
that
time
had
improved
the
appearance
of
the
man
of
he
was
tall
strong
erect
few
accusing
lines
marked
his
florid
face
in
his
curly
brown
hair
she
could
not
detect
a
touch
of
grey
he
had
a
new
air
of
mastery
and
success
which
expressed
itself
in
the
corners
of
his
firm
lips
and
the
steady
humorous
gleam
in
his
eyes
you
must
be
tired
after
your
hot
train
journey
she
said
he
laughed
again
tired
after
a
couple
of
hours
now
if
it
had
been
a
couple
of
days
as
we
are
accustomed
to
on
the
other
side
but
go
on
talking
just
to
let
me
keep
on
hearing
your
voice
yours
i
could
have
recognised
it
over
a
telephone
and
it
english
you
no
idea
how
delicious
it
is
and
the
smell
of
the
room
he
drew
in
a
deep
breath
is
you
and
the
english
country
i
tell
you
it
good
to
be
back
she
flushed
his
pleasure
was
so
sincere
and
she
smiled
but
why
should
we
stand
let
me
take
your
hat
and
stick
why
should
we
sit
in
the
garden
after
my
hot
and
tiring
journey
they
both
laughed
is
the
old
wistaria
still
there
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
she
turned
her
face
away
yes
still
there
do
you
remember
it
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
do
you
think
i
could
forget
it
i
remember
every
turn
of
the
house
let
us
go
outside
then
she
led
the
way
and
he
followed
to
the
trellis
arbour
a
few
steps
from
the
door
the
long
lilac
blooms
had
gone
with
the
spring
but
the
luxuriant
summer
leafage
cast
a
grateful
shade
roger
orme
sat
in
a
wicker
chair
and
fanned
himself
with
his
straw
hat
delightful
he
said
and
i
smell
stocks
it
does
carry
me
back
i
wonder
if
i
have
been
away
at
all
i
afraid
you
have
said
winifred
for
twenty
years
well
i
not
going
away
again
i
had
my
share
of
work
and
what
the
good
of
work
just
to
make
money
i
made
enough
i
sold
out
before
i
left
but
in
your
letters
you
always
said
you
liked
america
so
i
did
it
the
only
country
in
the
world
for
the
young
and
eager
if
i
had
been
born
there
i
should
have
no
use
for
dunsfield
but
a
man
born
and
bred
among
old
sleepy
things
has
the
nostalgia
of
old
sleepy
things
in
his
blood
now
tell
me
about
the
sleepy
old
things
i
want
to
hear
i
think
i
have
written
to
you
about
everything
that
ever
happened
in
dunsfield
she
said
but
still
there
were
gaps
to
be
bridged
in
the
tale
of
births
and
marriages
and
deaths
the
main
chronicles
of
the
neighbourhood
he
had
a
surprising
memory
and
plucked
obscure
creatures
from
the
past
whom
even
winifred
had
forgotten
it
almost
miraculous
how
you
remember
it
a
faculty
i
had
to
cultivate
said
he
they
talked
about
his
immediate
plans
he
was
going
to
put
the
lodge
into
thorough
repair
bring
everything
lay
in
electric
light
and
a
central
heating
installation
fix
bathrooms
wherever
bathrooms
would
go
and
find
a
place
somewhere
for
a
his
surveyor
had
already
made
his
report
and
was
to
meet
him
at
the
house
the
following
morning
as
for
decorations
curtaining
carpeting
and
æsthetic
aspects
he
was
counting
on
winifred
assistance
he
thought
that
blues
and
browns
would
harmonise
with
the
in
the
until
the
house
was
ready
his
headquarters
would
be
the
red
lion
you
see
i
going
to
begin
right
now
said
he
she
admired
his
vitality
his
certainty
of
accomplishment
the
hall
was
still
lit
by
lamps
and
candles
and
although
on
her
return
from
a
visit
she
had
often
deplored
the
absence
of
electric
light
she
had
shrunk
from
the
strain
and
worry
of
an
innovation
and
here
was
roger
turning
the
whole
house
inside
out
more
cheerfully
than
she
would
turn
out
a
drawer
you
help
me
wo
you
he
asked
i
want
a
home
with
a
touch
of
the
woman
in
it
i
lived
so
long
in
masculine
stiffness
you
know
that
i
should
love
to
do
anything
i
could
roger
she
replied
happily
he
remarked
again
that
it
was
good
to
be
back
no
more
letters
they
were
unsatisfactory
after
all
he
hoped
she
had
not
resented
his
business
man
habit
of
typewriting
this
was
in
the
year
of
grace
eighteen
hundred
and
and
save
for
roger
letters
typewritten
documents
came
as
seldom
as
judgment
summonses
to
duns
hall
we
go
ahead
in
america
said
he
old
order
changeth
yielding
place
to
new
i
accept
it
she
said
with
a
smile
what
i
longed
for
in
dunsfield
he
said
is
the
old
order
that
does
change
i
do
believe
anything
has
changed
she
plucked
up
her
courage
now
she
would
challenge
him
get
it
over
at
once
she
would
watch
his
lips
as
he
answered
i
afraid
i
must
have
changed
roger
in
what
way
i
am
no
longer
twenty
your
voice
is
just
the
same
shocked
she
put
up
her
delicate
hands
do
it
hurts
what
you
need
have
put
it
that
way
you
might
have
told
a
polite
lie
he
rose
turned
aside
holding
the
back
of
the
wicker
chair
i
got
something
to
tell
you
he
said
abruptly
you
would
have
to
find
out
soon
so
you
may
as
well
know
now
but
do
be
alarmed
or
concerned
i
ca
see
your
face
what
do
you
mean
i
been
stone
blind
for
fifteen
years
blind
she
sat
for
some
moments
paralysed
it
was
inconceivable
this
man
was
so
strong
so
alive
so
masterful
with
the
bright
face
and
keen
humorous
eyes
and
blind
a
trivial
undercurrent
of
thought
ran
subconsciously
beneath
her
horror
she
had
wondered
why
he
had
insisted
on
sounds
and
scents
why
he
had
kept
his
stick
in
his
hand
why
he
had
touched
things
tables
window
jambs
chairs
now
she
knew
roger
went
on
talking
and
she
heard
him
in
a
dream
he
had
not
informed
her
when
he
was
stricken
because
he
had
wished
to
spare
her
unnecessary
anxiety
also
he
was
proud
perhaps
hard
and
resented
sympathy
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
win
through
in
spite
of
his
affliction
for
some
years
it
had
been
the
absorbing
passion
of
his
life
he
had
won
through
like
many
another
and
as
the
irreparable
detachment
of
the
retina
had
not
disfigured
his
eyes
it
was
his
joy
to
go
through
the
world
like
a
seeing
man
hiding
his
blindness
from
the
casual
observer
by
dictated
letter
he
could
never
have
made
her
understand
how
trifling
a
matter
it
was
and
i
deceived
even
you
he
laughed
tears
had
been
rolling
down
her
cheeks
at
his
laugh
she
gave
way
an
answering
choke
hysterical
filled
her
throat
and
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
sobbing
he
laid
his
hand
tenderly
on
her
head
my
dear
do
i
am
the
happiest
man
alive
and
as
for
eyes
rich
enough
to
buy
a
hundred
pairs
i
a
perfect
argus
but
winifred
goode
wept
uncontrollably
there
was
deep
pity
for
him
in
her
heart
but
never
to
be
revealed
to
mortal
there
was
also
horrible
terrifying
joy
she
gripped
her
hands
and
sobbed
frantically
to
keep
herself
from
laughter
a
woman
sense
of
humour
is
often
cruel
only
to
be
awakened
by
tragic
incongruities
she
had
passed
through
her
month
agony
and
shame
for
a
blind
man
at
last
she
mastered
herself
forgive
me
dear
roger
it
was
a
dreadful
shock
blindness
has
always
been
to
me
too
awful
for
thought
like
being
buried
alive
not
a
bit
of
it
he
said
cheerily
i
run
a
successful
business
in
the
dark
real
estate
buying
and
selling
and
developing
land
you
know
a
thing
which
requires
a
man
to
keep
a
sharp
and
which
he
could
do
if
he
were
buried
alive
it
a
confounded
nuisance
i
admit
but
so
is
gout
not
half
as
irritating
as
the
position
of
a
man
i
once
knew
who
had
both
hands
cut
off
she
shivered
that
horrible
it
is
said
he
but
blindness
is
the
maid
appeared
with
the
which
she
put
on
a
rustic
table
it
was
then
that
winifred
noticed
the
little
proud
awkwardness
of
the
blind
man
there
was
pathos
in
his
insistent
disregard
of
his
affliction
the
imperfectly
cut
lower
half
of
a
watercress
sandwich
fell
on
his
coat
and
stayed
there
she
longed
to
pick
it
off
but
did
not
dare
for
fear
of
hurting
him
he
began
to
talk
again
of
the
house
the
scheme
of
decoration
oh
it
all
seems
so
sad
she
cried
what
you
not
be
able
to
see
the
beautiful
things
good
heavens
he
retorted
do
you
think
i
am
quite
devoid
of
imagination
and
do
you
suppose
no
one
will
enter
the
house
but
myself
i
never
thought
of
that
she
admitted
as
for
the
interior
i
got
the
plan
in
my
head
and
could
walk
about
it
now
blindfold
only
that
unnecessary
and
when
it
all
fixed
up
i
have
a
ground
model
made
of
every
room
showing
every
piece
of
furniture
so
that
when
i
get
in
i
know
the
size
shape
colour
quality
of
every
blessed
thing
in
the
house
you
see
if
i
do
these
gifts
are
a
merciful
dispensation
of
providence
maybe
said
he
drily
only
they
were
about
the
size
of
bacteria
when
i
started
and
it
took
me
years
of
incessant
toil
to
develop
them
he
asked
to
be
shown
around
the
garden
she
took
him
up
the
gravelled
walks
beside
her
gay
borders
and
her
roses
telling
him
the
names
and
varieties
of
the
flowers
once
he
stopped
and
frowned
i
lost
my
bearings
we
ought
to
be
passing
under
the
shade
of
the
old
walnut
tree
you
are
quite
right
she
said
marvelling
at
his
accuracy
it
stood
a
few
steps
back
but
it
was
blown
clean
down
three
years
ago
it
had
been
dead
for
a
long
time
he
chuckled
as
he
strolled
on
there
nothing
makes
me
so
mad
as
to
be
mistaken
some
time
later
on
their
return
to
the
terrace
he
held
out
his
hand
but
you
stay
for
dinner
roger
she
exclaimed
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
you
spending
your
first
evening
at
home
in
that
awful
lion
that
very
dear
of
you
winnie
he
said
evidently
touched
by
the
softness
in
her
voice
i
dine
with
pleasure
but
i
must
get
off
some
letters
first
i
come
back
you
no
objection
to
my
bringing
my
man
with
me
why
of
course
not
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
oh
roger
dear
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
how
my
heart
aches
for
you
do
worry
he
said
do
worry
a
little
bit
and
if
you
really
want
to
help
me
never
let
me
feel
that
you
notice
i
blind
forget
it
as
i
do
i
try
she
said
that
right
he
held
her
hand
for
a
second
or
two
kissed
it
and
dropped
it
abruptly
god
bless
you
said
he
it
good
to
be
with
you
again
when
he
was
gone
winifred
goode
returned
to
her
seat
by
the
clipped
yew
and
cried
a
little
after
the
manner
of
women
and
after
the
manner
of
women
she
dreamed
dreams
oblivious
of
the
flight
of
time
till
her
maid
came
out
and
hurried
her
indoors
she
dressed
with
elaborate
care
in
her
best
and
costliest
and
wore
more
jewels
than
she
would
have
done
had
her
guest
been
of
normal
sight
feeling
oddly
shaken
by
the
thought
of
his
intense
imaginative
vision
in
trying
to
fasten
the
diamond
clasp
of
a
velvet
band
round
her
neck
her
fingers
trembled
so
much
that
the
maid
came
to
her
assistance
her
mind
was
in
a
whirl
roger
had
left
her
a
headstrong
dissatisfied
boy
he
had
returned
the
romantic
figure
of
a
conqueror
all
the
more
romantic
and
conquering
by
reason
of
his
triumph
over
the
powers
of
darkness
in
his
deep
affection
she
knew
her
place
was
secure
the
few
hours
she
had
passed
with
him
had
shown
her
that
he
was
a
man
trained
in
the
significance
not
only
of
words
but
also
of
his
attitude
towards
individual
men
and
women
he
would
not
have
said
god
bless
you
unless
he
meant
it
she
appreciated
to
the
full
his
masculine
strength
she
took
to
her
heart
his
masculine
tenderness
she
had
a
woman
pity
for
his
affliction
she
felt
unregenerate
exultancy
at
the
undetected
crime
of
lost
beauty
and
yet
she
feared
him
on
account
of
the
vanished
sense
she
loved
him
with
a
passionate
recrudescence
of
girlish
sentiment
but
the
very
thing
that
might
have
that
ought
to
have
that
she
felt
it
indecent
not
to
have
inflamed
all
her
woman
soul
and
thrown
her
reckless
into
his
arms
raised
between
them
an
impalpable
barrier
against
which
she
dreaded
lest
she
might
be
dashed
and
bruised
at
dinner
this
feeling
was
intensified
roger
made
little
or
no
allusion
to
his
blindness
he
talked
with
the
ease
of
the
cultivated
man
of
the
world
he
had
humour
gaiety
charm
as
a
mere
companion
she
had
rarely
met
during
her
long
seclusion
a
man
so
instinctive
in
sympathy
so
quick
in
diverting
talk
into
a
channel
of
interest
in
a
few
flashing
yet
subtle
questions
he
learned
what
she
wore
the
diamond
clasp
to
the
black
velvet
band
he
recognized
as
having
been
her
mother
he
complimented
her
delicately
on
her
appearance
as
though
he
saw
her
clearly
in
the
adorable
twilight
beauty
that
was
really
hers
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
should
be
blind
but
behind
his
chair
silent
impassive
arresting
freezing
hovered
his
chinese
capped
loosely
clad
in
white
a
creature
as
unreal
in
dunsfield
as
gnome
or
merman
who
with
the
unobtrusiveness
of
a
shadow
from
another
world
served
in
the
mechanics
of
the
meal
as
an
accepted
disregarded
and
unnoticed
pair
of
eyes
for
his
master
the
noble
tudor
with
its
great
carved
oak
its
stately
portraits
its
jacobean
sideboards
and
presses
all
in
the
gloom
of
the
spent
illumination
of
the
candles
on
the
table
familiar
to
her
from
her
earliest
childhood
part
of
her
conception
of
the
cosmos
part
of
her
very
self
seemed
metamorphosed
into
the
unreal
the
phantasmagoric
by
the
presence
of
this
exotic
figure
not
a
man
but
an
eerie
embodiment
of
the
sense
of
sight
her
reason
told
her
that
the
chinese
servant
was
but
an
ordinary
performing
minutely
specified
duties
for
a
generous
wage
but
the
duties
were
performed
magically
like
conjuror
tricks
it
was
practically
impossible
to
say
who
cut
up
roger
meat
who
helped
him
to
salt
or
to
vegetables
who
guided
his
hand
unerringly
to
the
wine
glass
so
abnormally
exquisite
was
the
between
the
two
that
roger
seemed
to
have
the
man
under
mesmeric
control
the
idea
bordered
on
the
monstrous
winifred
shivered
through
the
dinner
in
spite
of
roger
bright
talk
and
gratefully
welcomed
the
change
of
the
whither
the
automaton
did
not
follow
will
you
do
me
a
favour
winnie
he
asked
during
the
evening
meet
me
at
the
lodge
tomorrow
at
eleven
and
help
me
interview
these
building
people
then
you
can
have
a
finger
in
the
pie
from
the
very
start
she
said
somewhat
tremulously
why
do
you
want
me
to
have
a
finger
in
the
pie
good
heavens
he
cried
are
you
the
only
human
creature
in
this
country
i
care
a
straw
about
is
that
true
roger
sure
said
he
after
a
little
span
of
silence
he
laughed
people
on
this
side
do
say
that
sheer
american
i
like
it
said
winifred
when
he
parted
from
her
he
again
kissed
her
hand
and
again
said
god
bless
you
she
accompanied
him
to
the
hall
where
the
chinaman
ghostly
in
the
dimness
was
awaiting
him
with
hat
and
coat
suddenly
she
felt
that
she
abhorred
the
chinaman
that
night
she
slept
but
little
striving
to
analyse
her
feelings
of
one
fact
only
did
the
dawn
bring
certainty
that
for
all
her
love
of
him
for
all
his
charm
for
all
his
tenderness
towards
her
during
dinner
she
had
feared
him
horribly
she
saw
him
the
next
morning
in
a
new
and
yet
oddly
familiar
phase
he
was
attended
by
his
secretary
a
pallid
man
with
a
pencil
and
documents
for
ever
at
his
elbow
ghostly
automatic
during
their
wanderings
with
the
surveyor
through
the
bare
and
desolate
old
house
she
saw
the
master
of
men
at
work
accurate
in
every
detail
of
a
comprehensive
scheme
abrupt
imperious
denying
difficulties
with
harsh
impatience
he
leaned
over
his
secretary
and
pointed
to
portions
of
the
report
just
as
though
he
could
read
them
and
ordered
their
modification
withers
he
said
once
to
the
surveyor
who
was
raising
objections
i
always
get
what
i
want
because
i
make
dead
sure
that
what
i
want
is
attainable
i
not
an
idealist
if
i
say
a
thing
is
to
be
done
it
has
got
to
be
done
and
it
up
to
you
or
to
someone
else
to
do
it
they
went
through
the
house
from
furnace
to
garret
the
pallid
secretary
ever
at
roger
elbow
ever
rendering
him
imperceptible
services
ever
identifying
himself
with
the
sightless
man
mysteriously
following
his
thoughts
his
individuality
with
that
of
his
master
he
was
less
a
man
than
a
trained
faculty
like
the
chinese
servant
and
again
winifred
shivered
and
felt
afraid
more
and
more
during
the
weeks
that
followed
did
she
realize
the
iron
will
and
irresistible
force
of
the
man
she
loved
he
seemed
to
lay
a
relentless
grip
on
all
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
and
compel
them
to
the
expression
of
himself
only
towards
her
was
he
gentle
and
considerate
many
times
she
accompanied
him
to
london
to
the
great
shops
the
secretary
at
his
elbow
and
discussed
with
him
colours
and
materials
and
he
listened
to
her
with
affectionate
deference
she
often
noticed
that
the
secretary
translated
into
other
terms
her
description
of
things
this
irritated
her
and
once
she
suggested
leaving
the
secretary
behind
surely
she
urged
she
could
do
all
that
was
necessary
he
shook
his
head
no
my
dear
he
said
very
kindly
jukes
sees
for
me
i
like
you
to
see
for
me
in
the
way
jukes
does
she
was
the
only
person
from
whom
he
would
take
advice
or
suggestion
and
she
rendered
him
great
service
in
the
tasteful
equipment
of
the
house
and
in
the
engagement
of
a
staff
of
servants
so
free
a
hand
did
he
allow
her
in
certain
directions
so
obviously
and
deliberately
did
he
withdraw
from
her
sphere
of
operations
that
she
was
puzzled
it
was
not
until
later
when
she
knew
him
better
that
the
picture
vaguely
occurred
to
her
of
him
caressing
her
tenderly
with
one
hand
and
holding
the
rest
of
the
world
by
the
throat
with
the
other
on
the
day
when
he
took
up
his
residence
in
the
new
home
they
walked
together
through
the
rooms
in
high
spirits
boyishly
elated
he
gave
her
an
exhibition
of
his
marvellous
gifts
of
memory
minutely
describing
each
bit
of
furniture
and
its
position
in
every
room
the
colour
scheme
the
texture
of
curtains
the
pictures
on
the
walls
the
on
mantlepieces
and
tables
and
when
he
had
done
he
put
his
arm
round
her
shoulders
but
for
you
winnie
said
he
this
would
be
the
dreariest
possible
kind
of
place
but
the
spirit
of
you
pervades
it
and
makes
it
a
fragrant
paradise
the
words
and
tone
were
and
so
was
his
clasp
she
felt
very
near
him
very
happy
and
her
heart
throbbed
quickly
she
was
ready
to
give
her
life
to
him
you
are
making
me
a
proud
woman
she
murmured
he
patted
her
shoulder
and
laughed
as
he
released
her
i
only
say
what
true
my
dear
he
replied
and
then
abruptly
skipped
from
sentiment
to
practical
talk
winifred
had
a
touch
of
dismay
and
disappointment
tears
started
which
she
wiped
away
furtively
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
accept
him
in
spite
of
wang
fu
and
jukes
if
he
should
make
her
a
proposal
of
marriage
she
had
been
certain
that
the
moment
had
come
but
he
made
no
proposal
she
waited
she
waited
a
long
time
in
the
meanwhile
she
continued
to
be
roger
intimate
friend
and
companion
one
day
his
and
efficient
housekeeper
came
to
consult
her
the
woman
desired
to
give
notice
her
place
was
too
difficult
she
could
scarcely
believe
the
master
was
blind
he
saw
too
much
he
demanded
too
much
she
could
say
nothing
explicit
save
that
she
was
frightened
she
wept
after
the
nature
of
upset
housekeepers
winifred
soothed
her
and
advised
her
not
to
throw
up
so
lucrative
a
post
and
as
soon
as
she
had
an
opportunity
she
spoke
to
roger
he
laughed
his
usual
careless
laugh
they
all
begin
that
way
with
me
but
after
a
while
they
broken
in
you
did
quite
right
to
tell
strode
to
stay
and
after
a
few
months
winifred
saw
a
change
in
strode
and
not
only
in
strode
but
in
all
the
servants
whom
she
had
engaged
they
worked
the
household
like
parts
of
a
flawless
machine
they
grew
to
be
imperceptible
shadowy
automatic
like
wang
fu
and
jukes
the
months
passed
and
melted
into
years
roger
orme
became
a
great
personage
in
the
neighbourhood
he
interested
himself
in
local
affairs
served
on
the
urban
district
council
and
on
boards
innumerable
they
made
him
mayor
of
dunsfield
he
subscribed
largely
to
charities
and
entertained
on
a
sumptuous
scale
he
ruled
the
little
world
setting
a
ruthless
heel
on
proud
necks
and
making
the
humble
his
instruments
jukes
died
and
other
secretaries
came
and
those
who
were
not
instantly
dismissed
grew
to
be
like
jukes
in
the
course
of
time
roger
entered
parliament
as
member
for
the
division
he
became
a
force
in
politics
in
public
affairs
in
the
appointment
of
royal
commissions
committees
of
inquiry
his
name
was
the
first
to
occur
to
ministers
and
he
was
invariably
respected
dreaded
and
hated
by
his
colleagues
why
do
you
work
so
hard
roger
winifred
would
ask
he
would
say
with
one
of
his
laughs
because
there
a
dynamo
in
me
that
i
ca
stop
and
all
these
years
miss
winifred
goode
stayed
at
duns
hall
leading
her
secluded
life
when
roger
was
in
london
and
playing
hostess
for
him
with
diffident
graciousness
when
he
entertained
at
the
lodge
his
attitude
towards
her
never
varied
his
need
of
her
never
lessened
he
never
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
at
first
she
wondered
pined
a
little
and
then
like
a
brave
proud
woman
put
the
matter
behind
her
but
she
knew
that
she
counted
for
much
in
his
strange
existence
and
the
knowledge
comforted
her
and
as
the
years
went
on
and
all
the
lingering
shreds
of
youth
left
her
and
she
grew
gracefully
into
the
old
lady
she
came
to
regard
her
association
with
him
as
a
spiritual
marriage
then
after
twenty
years
the
dynamo
wore
out
the
fragile
tenement
of
flesh
roger
orme
at
broke
down
and
lay
on
his
one
day
he
sent
for
miss
winifred
goode
she
entered
the
a
woman
of
sixty
wrinkled
with
only
the
beauty
of
a
serene
step
across
the
threshold
of
old
age
he
bade
the
nurse
leave
them
alone
and
put
out
his
hand
and
held
hers
as
she
sat
beside
the
bed
what
kind
of
a
day
is
it
winnie
as
if
you
did
know
you
been
told
i
sure
twenty
times
what
does
it
matter
what
other
people
say
i
want
to
get
at
the
day
through
you
it
bright
and
sunny
a
perfect
day
of
early
summer
what
things
are
out
the
may
and
the
laburnum
and
the
lilac
and
the
wistaria
yes
the
wistaria
it
forty
years
ago
dear
and
your
voice
is
just
the
same
and
to
me
you
have
always
been
the
same
i
can
see
you
as
you
sit
there
with
your
dear
sensitive
face
the
creamy
cheek
in
which
the
blood
comes
and
goes
oh
heavens
so
different
from
the
blowsy
girls
nowadays
who
could
not
blush
if
well
well
i
know
although
i
blind
i
argus
you
know
dear
yes
i
can
see
you
with
your
soft
brown
eyes
and
pale
brown
hair
waved
over
your
pure
brow
there
is
a
fascinating
little
kink
on
the
side
let
me
feel
it
she
drew
her
head
away
frightened
then
suddenly
she
remembered
with
a
pang
of
thankfulness
that
the
queer
little
kink
had
defied
the
years
though
the
pale
brown
hair
was
white
she
guided
his
hand
and
he
felt
the
kink
and
he
laughed
in
his
old
exultant
way
do
you
think
i
a
miracle
winnie
you
the
most
wonderful
man
living
she
said
i
sha
be
living
long
no
my
dear
do
talk
platitudes
i
know
i
busted
and
i
glad
i
going
before
i
begin
to
dodder
a
seeing
dodderer
is
bad
enough
but
a
blind
dodderer
only
fit
for
the
grave
i
lived
my
life
i
proved
to
this
stupendous
clot
of
ignorance
that
is
humanity
that
a
blind
man
can
guide
them
wherever
he
likes
you
know
i
refused
a
knighthood
any
tradesman
can
buy
a
knighthood
the
only
knighthoods
that
count
are
those
that
are
given
to
artists
and
writers
and
men
of
science
and
if
i
could
live
i
raise
hell
over
the
matter
and
make
a
differentiation
in
the
titles
of
honour
between
the
great
man
and
the
rascally
cheesemonger
my
dear
said
miss
winifred
goode
do
get
so
excited
i
only
saying
winnie
that
i
refused
a
knighthood
but
what
i
have
told
you
what
i
supposed
to
keep
a
dead
secret
if
i
could
live
a
few
weeks
longer
and
i
sha
i
should
be
a
privy
councillor
a
thing
worth
being
i
had
the
official
intimation
a
thing
that
ca
be
bought
heavens
if
i
were
a
younger
man
and
there
were
the
life
in
me
i
should
be
the
prime
minister
of
this
country
the
first
great
blind
ruler
that
ever
was
in
the
world
think
of
it
but
i
do
want
anything
now
i
done
i
glad
the
whole
caboodle
is
but
leather
and
prunella
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
that
is
of
any
importance
what
is
that
dear
she
asked
quite
innocently
accustomed
to
but
never
familiar
with
his
vehement
paradox
love
said
he
he
gripped
her
hand
hard
there
passed
a
few
seconds
of
tense
silence
winnie
dear
he
said
at
last
will
you
kiss
me
she
bent
forward
and
he
put
his
arm
round
her
neck
and
drew
her
to
him
they
kissed
each
other
on
the
lips
it
forty
years
since
i
kissed
you
dear
that
day
under
the
wistaria
and
now
i
dying
i
can
tell
you
i
loved
you
all
the
time
winnie
i
a
tough
nut
as
you
know
and
whatever
i
do
i
do
intensely
i
loved
you
intensely
furiously
she
turned
her
head
away
unable
to
bear
the
living
look
in
the
sightless
eyes
why
did
you
never
tell
me
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
would
you
have
married
me
you
know
i
would
roger
at
first
i
vowed
i
would
say
nothing
he
said
after
a
pause
until
i
had
a
fit
home
to
offer
you
then
the
blindness
came
and
i
vowed
i
would
speak
until
i
had
conquered
the
helplessness
of
my
affliction
do
you
understand
yes
but
when
you
came
home
a
conqueror
i
loved
you
too
much
to
marry
you
you
were
far
too
dear
and
precious
to
come
into
the
intimacy
of
my
life
have
you
seen
what
happened
to
all
those
who
did
he
raised
his
old
knotted
hands
clenched
tightly
i
squeezed
them
dry
i
could
help
it
my
blindness
made
me
a
coward
it
has
been
hell
the
darkness
never
ceased
to
frighten
me
i
lied
when
i
said
it
did
matter
i
stretched
out
my
hands
like
tentacles
and
gripped
everyone
within
reach
in
a
kind
of
madness
of
i
made
them
give
up
their
souls
and
senses
to
me
it
was
some
ghastly
hypnotic
power
i
seemed
to
have
when
i
had
got
them
they
lost
volition
individuality
they
were
about
as
much
living
creatures
to
me
as
my
arm
or
my
foot
do
you
see
the
woman
looked
at
the
old
face
working
passionately
and
she
felt
once
more
the
deadly
fear
of
him
but
with
me
it
would
have
been
different
she
faltered
you
say
you
loved
me
that
the
devil
of
it
my
sweet
beautiful
winnie
it
would
have
been
different
i
should
have
squeezed
you
too
reduced
you
to
the
helpless
thing
that
did
my
bidding
sucked
your
life
blood
from
you
i
could
have
resisted
so
i
kept
you
away
have
i
ever
asked
you
to
use
your
eyes
for
me
her
memory
travelled
down
the
years
and
she
was
amazed
she
remembered
jukes
at
the
great
shops
and
many
similar
incidents
that
had
puzzled
her
no
she
said
there
was
a
short
silence
the
muscles
of
his
face
relaxed
and
the
old
sweet
smile
came
over
it
he
reached
again
for
her
hand
and
caressed
it
tenderly
by
putting
you
out
of
my
life
i
kept
you
dear
i
kept
you
as
the
one
beautiful
human
thing
i
had
every
hour
of
happiness
i
have
had
for
the
last
twenty
years
has
come
through
you
she
said
tearfully
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
roger
it
a
queer
is
it
he
said
after
a
pause
most
people
would
say
that
i
ruined
your
life
if
it
had
been
for
me
you
might
have
married
no
dear
she
replied
i
had
a
very
full
and
happy
life
the
nurse
came
into
the
room
to
signify
the
end
of
the
visit
and
found
them
hand
in
hand
like
lovers
he
laughed
nurse
said
he
you
see
a
dying
but
a
jolly
happy
old
man
two
days
afterwards
roger
orme
died
on
the
afternoon
of
the
funeral
miss
winifred
goode
sat
in
the
old
garden
in
the
shade
of
the
clipped
yew
and
looked
at
the
house
in
which
she
had
been
born
and
in
which
she
had
passed
her
sixty
years
of
life
and
at
the
old
wistaria
beneath
which
he
had
kissed
her
forty
years
ago
she
smiled
and
murmured
aloud
no
i
would
not
have
had
a
single
thing
different
iii
a
lover
dilemma
how
are
you
feeling
now
words
could
not
express
the
music
of
these
six
liquid
syllables
that
fell
through
the
stillness
and
the
blackness
on
my
ears
not
very
bright
i
afraid
nurse
said
i
think
of
something
to
do
with
streams
and
moonlight
and
you
may
have
an
idea
of
the
mellow
ripple
of
the
laugh
i
heard
i
not
the
nurse
ca
you
tell
the
difference
i
miss
deane
deane
daughter
deane
i
echoed
do
you
know
where
you
are
every
thing
is
still
confused
said
i
had
an
idea
that
they
had
carried
me
somewhere
by
train
and
put
me
into
a
bed
and
that
people
had
tended
my
eyes
but
where
i
was
i
neither
knew
nor
cared
torture
and
blindness
had
been
quite
enough
to
occupy
my
mind
you
are
at
deane
house
said
the
voice
and
deane
is
the
twin
brother
of
deane
the
great
oculist
of
grandchester
who
was
summoned
to
when
you
met
with
your
accident
perhaps
you
know
you
had
a
gun
accident
i
suppose
it
was
only
that
after
all
said
i
but
it
felt
like
the
disruption
of
the
solar
system
are
you
still
in
great
pain
my
unseen
hostess
asked
sympathetically
not
since
you
have
been
in
the
room
i
mean
i
added
chilled
by
a
span
of
silence
i
mean
i
am
just
stating
what
happens
to
be
a
fact
oh
she
said
shortly
well
my
uncle
found
that
you
could
be
properly
treated
at
your
friend
little
place
at
so
he
brought
you
to
grandchester
and
here
you
are
but
i
do
understand
said
i
why
i
should
be
a
guest
in
your
house
you
are
not
a
guest
she
laughed
you
are
here
on
the
most
sordid
and
commercial
footing
your
friend
i
forget
his
name
mobray
said
i
mobray
settled
it
with
my
uncle
you
see
the
house
is
large
and
father
practice
small
as
we
keep
a
nursing
home
for
my
patients
of
course
we
have
trained
nurses
are
you
one
i
asked
not
exactly
i
do
the
housekeeping
but
i
can
settle
those
uncomfortable
pillows
i
felt
her
dexterous
cool
hands
about
my
head
and
neck
for
a
moment
or
two
my
eyes
ceased
to
ache
and
i
wished
i
could
see
her
in
tendering
my
thanks
i
expressed
the
wish
she
laughed
her
delicious
laugh
if
you
could
see
you
would
be
here
and
therefore
you
could
see
me
anyhow
shall
i
ever
see
you
i
asked
dismally
why
of
course
do
you
know
that
henry
deane
is
one
of
the
greatest
oculists
in
england
we
discussed
my
case
and
the
miraculous
skill
of
henry
deane
presently
she
left
me
promising
to
return
the
tones
of
her
voice
seemed
to
linger
as
perfume
would
in
the
darkness
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
it
was
love
not
at
first
sight
but
at
first
sound
pain
and
anxiety
stood
like
abashed
goblins
at
the
back
of
my
mind
valerie
deane
voice
danced
in
front
like
a
triumphant
fairy
when
she
came
and
talked
platitudes
i
had
sooner
listened
to
her
than
to
the
music
of
the
spheres
at
that
early
stage
what
she
said
mattered
so
little
i
would
have
given
rapturous
heed
to
her
reading
of
logarithmic
tables
i
asked
her
silly
questions
merely
to
elicit
the
witchery
of
her
voice
when
melba
sings
do
you
take
count
of
the
idiot
words
you
close
eyes
and
intellect
and
just
let
the
divine
notes
melt
into
your
soul
and
when
you
are
lying
on
your
back
blind
and
helpless
as
i
was
your
soul
is
a
very
sponge
for
anything
beautiful
that
can
reach
it
after
a
while
she
gave
me
glimpses
of
herself
sweet
and
womanly
and
we
drifted
from
commonplace
into
deeper
things
she
was
the
perfect
companion
we
discussed
all
topics
from
chiffons
to
schopenhauer
like
most
women
she
execrated
schopenhauer
she
must
have
devoted
much
of
her
time
to
me
yet
i
ungratefully
complained
of
the
long
intervals
between
her
visits
but
oh
those
interminable
idle
hours
of
darkness
in
which
all
the
thoughts
that
had
ever
been
thought
were
rethought
over
and
over
again
until
the
mind
became
a
only
those
who
have
been
through
the
valley
of
this
shadow
can
know
its
desolation
only
they
can
understand
the
magic
of
the
unbeheld
valerie
deane
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
she
asked
one
morning
nurse
says
you
are
fretful
and
fractious
she
insisted
on
soaping
the
soles
of
my
feet
and
tickling
me
into
torments
which
made
me
fractious
and
i
dying
to
see
your
face
which
makes
me
fretful
since
when
have
you
been
dying
she
asked
from
the
first
moment
i
heard
your
voice
saying
are
you
feeling
now
it
irritating
to
have
a
friend
and
not
in
the
least
know
what
she
is
like
besides
i
added
your
voice
is
so
beautiful
that
your
face
must
be
the
same
she
laughed
your
face
is
like
your
laugh
i
declared
if
my
face
were
my
fortune
i
should
come
off
badly
she
said
in
a
light
tone
i
think
she
was
leaning
over
the
and
i
longed
for
her
nearer
presence
nurse
has
tied
this
bandage
a
little
too
tightly
i
said
mendaciously
i
heard
her
move
and
in
a
moment
her
fingers
were
busy
about
my
eyes
i
put
up
my
hand
and
touched
them
she
patted
my
hand
away
please
do
be
foolish
she
remarked
when
you
recover
your
sight
and
find
what
an
exceedingly
plain
girl
i
am
you
go
away
like
the
others
and
never
want
to
see
me
again
what
others
i
exclaimed
do
you
suppose
you
the
only
patient
i
have
had
to
manage
i
loathed
the
others
with
a
horrible
detestation
but
i
said
after
reflection
tell
me
about
yourself
i
know
you
are
called
valerie
from
deane
how
old
are
you
she
pinned
the
bandage
in
front
of
my
forehead
oh
i
young
enough
she
answered
with
a
laugh
and
i
and
i
have
a
bad
figure
but
i
have
any
good
looks
at
all
at
all
tell
me
said
i
impatiently
exactly
how
you
do
look
i
must
know
i
have
a
sallow
complexion
not
very
good
skin
and
a
low
forehead
an
excellent
thing
said
i
but
my
eyebrows
and
hair
run
in
straight
parallel
lines
so
it
is
she
retorted
it
is
very
ugly
i
have
thin
black
hair
let
me
feel
certainly
not
and
my
eyes
are
a
sort
of
watery
china
blue
and
much
too
small
and
my
nose
is
a
bad
nose
altogether
but
it
fleshy
one
of
those
nondescript
unaristocratic
noses
that
always
looks
as
if
it
has
got
a
cold
my
mouth
is
large
i
am
looking
at
myself
in
the
glass
my
my
teeth
are
white
yes
they
are
nice
and
white
but
they
are
large
and
protrude
you
know
the
french
caricature
of
an
englishwoman
teeth
really
now
i
consider
the
question
i
am
the
image
of
the
english
in
a
french
comic
paper
i
do
believe
it
i
declared
it
is
true
i
know
i
have
a
pretty
voice
but
that
is
all
it
deceives
blind
people
they
think
i
must
be
pretty
too
and
when
they
see
me
soir
la
and
i
such
a
thin
miserable
face
coming
to
the
chin
in
a
point
like
a
kite
there
have
you
a
clear
idea
of
me
now
no
said
i
for
i
believe
you
are
wilfully
misrepresenting
yourself
besides
beauty
does
not
depend
upon
features
regular
in
themselves
but
the
way
those
features
are
put
together
oh
mine
are
arranged
in
an
amiable
sort
of
way
i
do
look
cross
you
must
look
sweetness
itself
said
i
she
sighed
and
said
meditatively
it
is
a
great
misfortune
for
a
girl
to
be
so
desperately
plain
the
consciousness
of
it
comes
upon
her
like
a
cold
when
she
is
out
with
other
girls
now
there
is
my
cousin
which
cousin
my
uncle
henry
daughter
shall
i
tell
you
about
her
i
am
not
in
the
least
interested
in
your
cousin
i
replied
she
laughed
and
the
entrance
of
the
nurse
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
now
i
must
make
a
confession
i
was
grievously
disappointed
her
detailed
description
of
herself
as
a
sallow
young
woman
awoke
me
with
a
shock
from
my
dreams
of
a
radiant
goddess
it
arrested
my
infatuation
in
my
dismay
was
painful
i
began
to
pity
her
for
being
so
unattractive
for
the
next
day
or
two
even
her
beautiful
voice
failed
in
its
seduction
but
soon
a
face
began
to
dawn
before
me
elusive
at
first
and
then
gradually
gaining
in
definition
at
last
the
picture
flashed
upon
my
mental
vision
with
sudden
vividness
and
it
has
never
left
me
to
this
day
its
steadfastness
convinced
me
of
its
accuracy
it
was
so
real
that
i
could
see
its
expression
vary
as
she
spoke
according
to
her
mood
the
plainness
almost
ugliness
of
the
face
repelled
me
i
thought
ruefully
of
having
dreamed
of
kisses
from
the
lips
that
barely
closed
in
front
of
the
great
white
teeth
yet
after
a
while
its
higher
qualities
exercised
a
peculiar
attraction
a
brave
tender
spirit
shone
through
an
intellectual
alertness
redeemed
the
heavy
features
the
low
ugly
brow
the
coarse
nose
the
large
mouth
and
as
i
lay
thinking
and
picturing
there
was
revealed
in
an
illuminating
flash
the
secret
of
the
harmony
between
face
and
voice
thenceforward
valerie
deane
was
invested
with
a
beauty
all
her
own
i
loved
the
dear
plain
face
as
i
loved
the
beautiful
voice
and
the
touch
of
her
fingers
and
the
tender
laughing
womanliness
and
all
that
went
with
the
concept
of
valerie
deane
had
i
possessed
the
daring
of
young
lochinvar
i
should
on
several
occasions
have
declared
my
passion
but
by
temperament
i
am
a
diffident
procrastinator
i
habitually
lose
golden
moments
as
some
people
habitually
lose
umbrellas
alas
there
is
no
lost
property
office
for
golden
moments
still
i
vow
although
nothing
definite
was
said
that
when
the
unanticipated
end
drew
near
our
intercourse
was
arrant
all
pain
had
gone
from
my
eyes
i
was
up
and
dressed
and
permitted
to
grope
my
way
about
the
blackness
i
was
to
have
my
first
brief
glimpse
of
things
for
three
weeks
in
the
darkened
room
i
was
in
high
spirits
valerie
paying
her
morning
visit
seemed
depressed
but
think
of
it
i
cried
in
pardonable
egotism
i
shall
be
able
to
see
you
i
longed
for
it
as
much
as
for
the
sight
of
the
blue
sky
there
is
any
blue
sky
said
valerie
it
an
inverted
tureen
that
has
held
her
voice
had
all
the
melancholy
notes
of
the
woodwind
in
the
unseen
shepherd
lament
in
tristan
und
isolde
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
she
exclaimed
tragically
after
a
pause
i
sha
be
here
it
a
bitter
disappointment
my
aunt
in
wales
is
dying
i
have
been
telegraphed
for
and
i
must
go
she
sat
on
the
end
of
the
couch
where
i
was
lounging
and
took
my
hands
it
is
my
fault
my
spirits
fell
headlong
i
would
just
as
soon
keep
blind
said
i
blankly
i
thought
you
would
say
that
a
tear
dropped
on
my
hand
i
felt
that
it
was
brutal
of
her
aunt
to
make
valerie
cry
why
could
she
not
postpone
her
demise
to
a
more
suitable
opportunity
i
murmured
however
a
few
decent
words
of
condolence
thank
you
winter
said
valerie
i
am
fond
of
my
aunt
but
i
had
set
my
heart
on
your
seeing
me
and
she
may
not
die
for
weeks
and
weeks
she
was
dying
for
ever
so
long
last
year
and
got
round
again
i
ventured
an
arm
about
her
shoulders
and
spoke
consolingly
the
day
would
come
when
our
eyes
would
meet
i
called
her
valerie
and
bade
her
address
me
as
harold
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
who
strikes
out
a
new
line
in
is
a
genius
if
i
do
hurry
i
shall
miss
my
train
she
sighed
at
last
she
rose
i
felt
her
bend
over
me
her
hands
closed
on
my
cheeks
and
a
kiss
fluttered
on
my
lips
i
heard
the
light
swish
of
her
skirts
and
the
quick
opening
and
shutting
of
the
door
and
she
was
gone
valerie
aunt
like
king
charles
ii
was
an
unconscionable
time
when
a
note
from
valerie
announced
her
return
to
grandchester
i
had
already
gone
away
for
some
time
i
was
not
allowed
to
read
or
write
and
during
this
period
of
probation
urgent
affairs
summoned
me
to
vienna
such
letters
as
i
wrote
to
valerie
had
to
be
of
the
most
elementary
nature
if
you
have
a
heart
of
any
capacity
worth
troubling
about
you
can
not
empty
it
on
one
side
of
a
sheet
of
notepaper
for
mine
reams
would
have
been
inadequate
i
also
longed
to
empty
it
in
her
presence
my
eyes
meeting
hers
for
the
first
time
thus
ever
haunted
by
the
beloved
plain
face
and
the
memorable
voice
i
remained
inarticulate
as
soon
as
my
business
was
so
far
adjusted
that
i
could
leave
vienna
i
started
on
a
flying
visit
to
england
the
morning
after
my
arrival
beheld
me
in
a
railway
carriage
at
euston
waiting
for
the
train
to
carry
me
to
grandchester
i
had
telegraphed
to
valerie
also
to
deane
the
oculist
for
an
appointment
which
might
give
colour
to
my
visit
i
was
alone
in
the
compartment
my
thoughts
far
away
from
the
long
platform
leaped
the
four
hours
that
separated
me
from
grandchester
for
the
thousandth
time
i
pictured
our
meeting
i
foreshadowed
speeches
of
burning
eloquence
i
saw
the
homely
features
transfigured
i
closed
my
eyes
the
better
to
retain
the
beatific
vision
the
train
began
to
move
suddenly
the
door
was
opened
a
girlish
figure
sprang
into
the
compartment
and
a
porter
running
by
the
side
of
the
train
threw
in
a
bag
and
a
bundle
of
wraps
and
slammed
the
door
violently
the
young
lady
stood
with
her
back
to
me
panting
for
breath
the
luggage
lay
on
the
floor
i
stooped
to
pick
up
the
bag
so
did
the
young
lady
our
hands
met
as
i
lifted
it
to
the
rack
oh
please
do
trouble
she
cried
in
a
voice
whose
familiarity
made
my
heart
beat
i
caught
sight
of
her
face
for
the
first
time
and
my
heart
beat
faster
than
ever
it
was
her
face
the
face
that
had
dawned
upon
my
blindness
the
face
i
had
grown
to
worship
i
looked
at
her
transfixed
with
wonder
she
settled
herself
unconcerned
in
the
farther
corner
of
the
carriage
i
took
the
opposite
seat
and
leaned
forward
you
are
miss
deane
i
asked
tremulously
she
drew
herself
up
on
the
defensive
that
is
my
name
she
said
valerie
i
cried
in
exultation
she
half
rose
what
right
have
you
to
address
me
i
am
harold
winter
said
i
taken
aback
by
her
outraged
demeanour
is
it
possible
that
you
do
recognize
me
i
have
never
seen
or
heard
of
you
before
in
my
life
replied
the
young
lady
tartly
and
i
hope
you
wo
force
me
to
take
measures
to
protect
myself
against
your
impertinence
i
lay
back
against
the
cushions
gasping
with
dismay
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
recovering
i
am
neither
going
to
molest
you
nor
be
intentionally
impertinent
but
as
your
face
has
never
been
out
of
my
mind
for
three
months
and
as
i
am
travelling
straight
through
from
vienna
to
grandchester
to
see
it
for
the
first
time
i
may
be
excused
for
addressing
you
she
glanced
hurriedly
at
the
and
then
back
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
lunatic
you
are
miss
deane
of
grandchester
daughter
of
dr
deane
i
asked
yes
valerie
deane
then
i
have
told
you
so
then
all
i
can
say
is
i
cried
losing
my
temper
at
her
stony
heartlessness
that
your
conduct
in
turning
an
honest
decent
man
into
a
besotted
fool
and
then
disclaiming
all
knowledge
of
him
is
outrageous
it
damnable
the
language
has
a
word
to
express
it
she
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
cord
i
shall
really
have
to
call
the
guard
she
said
regarding
me
coolly
you
are
quite
free
to
do
so
i
answered
but
if
you
do
i
shall
have
to
show
your
letters
in
sheer
i
am
not
going
to
spend
the
day
in
a
she
let
go
the
cord
and
sat
down
again
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
she
asked
i
took
a
bundle
of
letters
from
my
pocket
and
tossed
one
over
to
her
she
glanced
at
it
quickly
started
as
if
in
great
surprise
and
handed
it
back
with
a
smile
i
did
not
write
that
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
her
equal
for
unblushing
impudence
her
mellow
tones
made
the
mockery
appear
all
the
more
diabolical
if
you
did
write
it
said
i
i
should
like
to
know
who
did
my
cousin
valerie
i
do
understand
said
i
my
name
is
valerie
deane
and
my
cousin
name
is
valerie
deane
and
this
is
her
handwriting
bewildered
i
passed
my
hand
over
my
eyes
what
feline
trick
was
she
playing
her
treachery
was
incomprehensible
i
suppose
it
was
your
cousin
valerie
who
tended
me
during
my
blindness
at
your
father
house
who
shed
tears
because
she
had
to
leave
me
who
quite
possibly
she
interrupted
only
it
would
have
been
at
her
father
house
and
not
mine
she
does
tend
blind
people
my
patients
i
looked
at
her
in
the
name
of
heaven
i
exclaimed
who
are
you
if
not
the
daughter
of
deane
of
stavaton
street
my
father
is
henry
deane
the
oculist
you
asked
if
i
were
the
daughter
of
deane
so
many
people
give
him
the
wrong
title
i
did
trouble
to
correct
you
it
took
me
a
few
moments
to
recover
i
had
been
making
a
pretty
fool
of
myself
i
stammered
out
pleas
for
a
thousand
pardons
i
confused
myself
and
her
in
explanation
then
i
remembered
that
the
fathers
were
twin
brothers
and
bore
a
strong
resemblance
one
to
the
other
what
more
natural
than
that
the
daughters
should
also
be
alike
what
i
ca
understand
said
miss
deane
is
how
you
mistook
me
for
my
cousin
your
voices
are
identical
but
our
outer
semblances
i
have
never
seen
your
cousin
she
left
me
before
i
recovered
my
sight
how
then
could
you
say
you
had
my
face
before
you
for
three
months
i
am
afraid
miss
deane
i
was
wrong
in
that
as
in
everything
else
it
was
her
face
i
had
a
mental
picture
of
it
she
put
on
a
puzzled
expression
and
you
used
the
mental
picture
for
the
purpose
of
recognition
yes
said
i
i
give
it
up
said
miss
deane
she
did
not
press
me
further
her
cousin
valerie
love
affairs
were
grounds
too
delicate
for
her
to
tread
upon
she
turned
the
conversation
by
politely
asking
me
how
i
had
come
to
consult
her
father
i
mentioned
my
friend
mobray
and
the
gun
accident
she
remembered
the
case
and
claimed
a
slight
acquaintance
with
mobray
whom
she
had
met
at
various
houses
in
grandchester
my
credit
as
a
sane
and
reputable
person
being
established
we
began
to
chat
most
amicably
i
found
miss
deane
an
accomplished
woman
we
talked
books
art
travel
she
had
the
swift
wit
which
delights
in
bridging
the
trivial
and
the
great
she
had
a
playful
fancy
never
have
i
found
a
personality
so
immediately
sympathetic
i
told
her
a
sad
little
viennese
story
in
which
i
happened
to
have
played
a
minor
part
and
her
tenderness
was
as
spontaneous
as
valerie
my
valerie
she
had
valerie
woodland
laugh
were
it
not
that
her
personal
note
her
touch
on
the
strings
of
life
differed
essentially
from
my
beloved
i
should
have
held
it
grotesquely
impossible
for
any
human
being
but
valerie
to
be
sitting
in
the
opposite
corner
of
that
railway
carriage
indeed
there
were
moments
when
she
was
valerie
when
the
girl
waiting
for
me
at
grandchester
faded
into
the
limbo
of
unreal
things
a
kiss
from
those
lips
had
fluttered
on
mine
it
were
lunacy
to
doubt
it
during
intervals
of
i
examined
her
face
critically
there
was
no
question
of
its
unattractiveness
to
the
casual
observer
the
nose
was
too
large
and
fleshy
the
teeth
too
prominent
the
eyes
too
small
but
my
love
had
pierced
to
its
underlying
spirituality
and
it
was
the
face
above
all
others
that
i
desired
toward
the
end
of
a
remarkably
short
four
hours
journey
miss
deane
graciously
expressed
the
hope
that
we
might
meet
again
i
shall
ask
valerie
said
i
to
present
me
in
due
form
she
smiled
maliciously
are
you
quite
sure
you
will
be
able
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
when
my
cousin
and
i
are
together
are
you
then
so
identically
alike
that
a
woman
way
of
answering
a
question
by
another
question
she
laughed
well
but
are
you
i
persisted
how
otherwise
could
you
have
mistaken
me
for
her
she
had
drawn
off
her
gloves
so
as
to
give
a
tidying
touch
to
her
hair
i
noticed
her
hands
small
long
and
deft
i
wondered
whether
they
resembled
valerie
would
you
do
me
the
great
favour
of
letting
me
touch
your
hand
while
i
shut
my
eyes
as
if
i
were
blind
she
held
out
her
hand
frankly
my
fingers
ran
over
it
for
a
few
seconds
as
they
had
done
many
times
over
valerie
well
she
asked
not
the
same
said
i
she
flushed
it
seemed
angrily
and
glanced
down
at
her
hand
on
which
she
immediately
proceeded
to
draw
a
glove
yours
are
stronger
and
finer
i
added
when
i
saw
that
the
tribute
of
strength
did
not
please
it
the
one
little
personal
thing
i
am
proud
of
she
remarked
you
have
made
my
four
hours
pass
like
four
minutes
said
i
a
service
to
a
which
you
might
take
some
pride
in
having
performed
when
i
was
a
child
i
could
have
said
the
same
of
performing
elephants
i
am
no
longer
a
child
miss
deane
said
i
with
a
bow
what
there
was
in
this
to
make
the
blood
rush
to
her
pale
cheeks
i
do
not
know
the
ways
of
women
have
often
surprised
me
i
have
heard
other
men
make
a
similar
confession
i
think
most
men
are
children
she
said
shortly
in
what
way
their
sweet
irresponsibility
said
miss
deane
and
then
the
train
entered
grandchester
station
i
deposited
my
bag
at
the
station
hotel
and
drove
straight
to
stavaton
street
i
forgot
miss
deane
my
thoughts
and
longings
centred
in
her
beloved
counterpart
with
her
tender
caressing
ways
and
just
a
subtle
inflection
in
the
voice
that
made
it
more
exquisite
than
the
voice
to
which
i
had
been
listening
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
recognized
me
and
smiled
a
welcome
miss
valerie
was
in
the
i
know
the
way
said
impetuous
i
ran
up
the
stairs
burst
into
the
and
stopped
short
on
the
threshold
in
presence
of
a
strange
and
exceedingly
beautiful
young
woman
she
was
stately
and
slender
she
had
masses
of
bright
brown
hair
waving
over
a
beautiful
brow
she
had
deep
sapphire
eyes
like
stars
she
had
the
complexion
of
a
greuze
child
she
had
that
air
of
fairy
diaphaneity
combined
with
the
glow
of
superb
health
which
makes
the
typical
loveliness
of
the
englishwoman
i
gaped
for
a
second
or
two
at
this
gracious
apparition
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
i
was
told
the
apparition
who
was
standing
by
the
fireplace
smiled
and
came
forward
with
extended
hands
why
harold
of
course
you
were
told
it
is
all
right
i
am
valerie
i
blinked
the
world
seemed
upside
down
the
enchanting
voice
rang
in
my
ears
but
it
harmonized
in
no
way
with
the
equally
enchanting
face
i
put
out
my
hand
how
do
you
do
i
said
stupidly
but
are
you
glad
to
see
me
asked
the
lovely
young
woman
of
course
said
i
i
came
from
vienna
to
see
you
but
you
look
disappointed
the
fact
is
i
stammered
i
expected
to
see
some
one
different
quite
different
the
face
you
described
has
been
haunting
me
for
three
months
she
had
the
effrontery
to
laugh
her
eyes
danced
mischief
did
you
really
think
me
such
a
hideous
fright
you
were
not
a
fright
at
all
said
i
remembering
my
late
travelling
companion
and
then
in
a
flash
i
realised
what
she
had
done
why
on
earth
did
you
describe
your
cousin
instead
of
yourself
my
cousin
how
do
you
know
that
never
mind
i
answered
you
did
during
your
description
you
had
her
face
vividly
before
your
mind
the
picture
was
in
some
telepathic
way
transferred
from
your
brain
to
mine
and
there
it
remained
the
proof
is
that
when
i
saw
a
certain
lady
i
recognised
her
at
once
and
greeted
her
effusively
as
valerie
her
name
did
happen
to
be
valerie
and
valerie
deane
too
and
i
ran
the
risk
of
a
and
i
do
think
it
was
fair
of
you
what
prompted
you
to
deceive
me
i
was
hurt
and
angry
and
i
spoke
with
some
acerbity
valerie
drew
herself
up
with
dignity
if
you
claim
an
explanation
i
will
give
it
to
you
we
have
had
young
men
patients
in
the
house
before
and
as
they
had
nothing
to
do
they
have
amused
themselves
and
annoyed
me
by
falling
in
love
with
me
i
was
tired
of
it
and
decided
that
it
should
happen
in
your
case
so
i
gave
a
false
description
of
myself
to
make
it
consistent
i
took
a
real
person
for
a
model
so
you
were
fooling
me
all
the
time
said
i
gathering
hat
and
stick
her
face
softened
adorably
her
voice
had
the
tones
of
the
not
all
the
time
harold
she
said
i
laid
down
hat
and
stick
then
why
did
you
not
undeceive
me
afterward
i
thought
she
said
blushing
and
giving
me
a
fleeting
glance
well
i
thought
you
you
would
be
sorry
to
find
i
was
bad
looking
i
am
sorry
valerie
said
i
and
that
the
mischief
of
it
i
was
so
looking
forward
to
your
seeing
me
she
said
tearfully
and
then
with
sudden
petulance
she
stamped
her
small
foot
it
is
horrid
of
you
perfectly
horrid
and
i
never
want
to
speak
to
you
again
the
last
word
ended
in
a
sob
she
rushed
to
the
door
pushed
me
aside
as
i
endeavoured
to
stop
her
and
fled
in
a
passion
of
tears
injuria
women
have
remained
much
the
same
since
the
days
of
juno
a
miserable
remorseful
being
i
wandered
through
the
grandchester
streets
to
keep
my
appointment
with
henry
deane
after
a
short
interview
he
dismissed
me
with
a
good
report
of
my
eyes
miss
deane
dressed
for
walking
met
me
in
the
hall
as
the
servant
was
showing
me
out
and
we
went
together
into
the
street
well
she
said
with
a
touch
of
irony
have
you
seen
my
cousin
yes
said
i
do
you
think
her
like
me
i
wish
to
heaven
she
were
i
exclaimed
fervently
i
should
be
swirling
round
in
a
sort
of
maelstrom
she
looked
steadily
at
me
i
like
her
downrightness
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
mean
i
am
in
love
with
the
personality
of
one
woman
and
the
face
of
another
and
i
never
shall
fall
out
of
love
with
the
face
and
the
personality
god
knows
i
groaned
i
never
conceived
it
possible
for
any
man
to
fall
in
love
with
a
face
so
hopelessly
unattractive
she
said
with
a
smile
it
is
beautiful
i
cried
she
looked
at
me
queerly
for
a
few
seconds
during
which
i
had
the
sensation
of
something
odd
uncanny
having
happened
i
was
fascinated
i
found
myself
saying
what
did
you
mean
by
the
irresponsibility
of
man
she
put
out
her
hand
abruptly
and
said
i
watched
her
disappear
swiftly
round
a
near
corner
and
i
went
my
head
buzzing
with
her
back
to
my
hotel
in
the
evening
i
dined
with
deane
i
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
valerie
alone
in
a
whisper
she
begged
forgiveness
i
relented
her
beauty
and
charm
would
have
mollified
a
cross
rhinoceros
the
love
in
her
splendid
eyes
would
have
warmed
a
snow
image
the
pressure
of
her
hand
at
parting
brought
back
the
old
valerie
and
i
knew
i
loved
her
desperately
but
inwardly
i
groaned
because
she
had
not
the
face
of
my
dreams
i
hated
her
beauty
as
soon
as
the
front
door
closed
behind
me
my
head
began
to
buzz
again
with
the
other
valerie
i
lay
awake
all
night
the
two
valeries
wove
themselves
inextricably
together
in
my
hopes
and
longings
i
worshipped
a
composite
chimera
when
the
grey
dawn
stole
through
my
bedroom
window
the
chimera
vanished
but
a
grey
dubiety
dawned
upon
my
soul
day
invested
it
with
a
ghastly
light
i
rose
a
shivering
wreck
and
fled
from
grandchester
by
the
first
train
i
have
not
been
back
to
grandchester
i
am
in
vienna
whither
i
returned
as
fast
as
the
orient
express
could
carry
me
i
go
to
bed
praying
that
night
will
dispel
my
doubt
i
wake
every
morning
to
my
adamantine
indecision
that
i
am
consuming
away
with
love
for
one
of
the
two
valeries
is
the
only
certain
fact
in
my
uncertain
existence
but
which
of
the
valeries
it
is
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
decide
if
any
woman
it
is
beyond
the
wit
of
man
could
solve
my
problem
and
save
me
from
a
hopeless
and
lifelong
celibacy
she
would
earn
my
undying
gratitude
iv
a
woman
of
the
war
it
was
a
tiny
room
at
the
top
of
what
used
to
be
a
princely
london
mansion
the
home
of
a
great
noble
a
tiny
room
eight
feet
by
five
the
in
the
good
old
days
for
some
unconsidered
or
the
walls
were
distempered
and
bare
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
a
chair
a
deal
chest
of
drawers
and
a
everything
spotless
there
was
no
fireplace
an
aerial
cell
of
a
room
yet
the
woman
in
nurse
uniform
who
sat
on
the
bed
pressing
her
hands
to
burning
eyes
and
aching
brows
thanked
god
for
it
she
thanked
god
for
the
privacy
of
it
had
she
been
a
mere
nurse
she
would
have
had
the
third
share
of
a
large
comfortable
bedroom
with
a
fire
on
bitter
winter
nights
but
as
a
sister
she
had
a
room
to
herself
thank
god
she
was
alone
coldly
stonily
silently
alone
the
expected
convoy
of
wounded
officers
had
been
late
and
she
had
remained
on
duty
beyond
her
hour
so
as
to
lend
a
hand
besides
she
was
not
on
the
regular
staff
of
the
private
hospital
she
had
broken
a
much
needed
rest
from
france
to
give
temporary
relief
from
pressure
so
an
extra
hour
or
two
did
not
matter
the
ambulances
at
length
arrived
some
some
walking
among
the
latter
was
one
strongly
knit
athletic
bandaged
over
the
entire
head
and
eyes
and
led
like
a
blind
man
by
orderlies
when
she
first
saw
him
in
the
vestibule
his
humorous
lips
and
resolute
chin
which
were
all
of
his
face
unhidden
seemed
curiously
familiar
but
during
the
bustle
of
installation
the
of
memory
became
extinct
it
was
only
later
when
she
found
that
this
man
was
assigned
to
her
care
that
she
again
took
particular
notice
of
him
now
that
his
overcoat
had
been
taken
off
she
saw
a
major
crown
on
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic
and
on
the
breast
the
ribbons
of
the
and
the
he
was
talking
to
the
matron
they
did
us
proud
all
the
way
had
an
excellent
dinner
it
awfully
kind
of
you
but
i
want
nothing
more
i
assure
you
save
just
to
get
into
bed
and
sleep
like
a
dog
and
then
she
knew
in
a
sudden
electric
shock
of
certainty
half
dazed
she
heard
the
matron
say
sister
this
is
major
shileto
of
the
canadian
army
half
dazed
too
she
took
his
gropingly
outstretched
hand
the
gesture
wide
of
the
mark
struck
her
with
terror
she
controlled
herself
the
matron
consulted
her
typed
and
ran
off
the
medical
statement
of
his
injuries
major
shileto
laughed
my
hat
if
i
got
all
that
the
matter
with
me
why
did
they
bury
me
decently
in
france
she
was
rent
by
the
gay
laughter
when
the
matron
turned
away
she
followed
her
he
is
blind
is
he
the
matron
to
whose
naturally
thin
pinched
face
worry
and
anxiety
had
added
a
touch
of
shrewishness
swung
round
on
her
i
thought
you
were
a
medical
student
is
there
anything
about
blindness
here
she
smote
the
typed
pages
of
course
not
the
night
staff
being
on
duty
she
had
then
fled
the
ward
and
mounted
up
the
many
stairs
to
the
little
room
where
she
now
sat
her
hands
to
her
eyes
thank
god
he
was
not
blind
and
thank
god
she
was
alone
but
it
had
all
happened
a
hundred
years
ago
well
twenty
years
at
least
in
some
vague
period
of
folly
before
the
war
yet
after
all
she
was
only
five
and
twenty
when
did
it
happen
she
began
an
agonized
calculation
of
dates
she
had
striven
almost
successfully
to
put
the
miserable
episode
out
of
her
mind
to
regard
that
period
of
her
life
as
a
phase
of
a
previous
existence
since
the
war
began
carried
on
the
of
absorbing
work
she
had
had
no
time
to
moralize
on
the
past
when
it
came
before
her
in
odd
moments
she
had
sent
it
packing
into
the
limbo
of
deformed
and
hateful
things
and
now
the
man
with
the
gay
laughter
and
the
distinguished
soldier
record
had
brought
it
all
back
horribly
vivid
for
the
scared
moments
it
was
as
though
the
revolutionary
had
never
been
she
saw
herself
again
the
camilla
warrington
whom
she
had
sought
contemptuously
to
bury
had
there
been
but
a
musk
grain
of
beauty
in
that
camilla
story
she
would
have
cherished
the
fragrance
but
it
had
all
been
so
ignoble
and
stupid
it
had
begun
with
her
clever
girlhood
the
london
university
matriculation
the
first
degree
john
donovan
the
great
surgeon
a
friend
of
her
parents
had
encouraged
her
ambitions
toward
a
medical
career
she
became
a
student
at
the
royal
free
hospital
of
the
consulting
staff
of
which
john
donovan
was
a
member
for
the
first
few
months
all
went
well
she
boarded
near
by
in
bloomsbury
with
a
vague
sort
of
aunt
and
distant
cousins
folks
of
unimpeachable
repute
then
fired
by
the
independent
theories
and
habits
of
a
couple
of
fellow
students
she
left
the
home
of
dull
respectability
and
joined
them
in
the
slatternly
bohemia
of
a
chelsea
slum
oh
there
was
excuse
for
her
youthful
ardency
to
know
all
that
there
was
to
be
known
in
the
world
at
once
but
if
she
had
used
her
excellent
brains
she
would
have
realized
that
all
that
is
to
be
known
in
the
world
could
not
be
learned
in
her
new
environment
the
unholy
crew
they
called
it
the
brotherhood
into
which
she
plunged
consisted
of
the
dregs
of
a
decadent
unclean
in
person
and
in
ethics
at
first
she
revolted
but
the
specious
intellectuality
of
the
crew
fascinated
her
hitherto
she
had
seen
life
purely
from
the
scientific
angle
material
cause
material
effect
on
material
life
art
but
an
excrescence
she
had
been
carelessly
content
to
regard
it
merely
as
an
interpretation
of
beauty
to
her
almost
synonymous
with
prettiness
at
the
various
of
the
crew
who
talked
with
the
interminability
of
a
russian
bolshevik
she
learned
a
surprising
lot
of
things
about
art
that
had
never
entered
into
her
philosophy
she
learned
or
tried
to
learn
though
her
intelligence
boggled
fearfully
at
it
that
the
most
vital
thing
in
existence
was
the
decomposition
of
phenomena
into
interesting
planes
all
things
in
nature
were
in
motion
as
a
scientific
truth
she
was
inclined
to
accept
the
proposition
but
the
proclaimed
fact
that
the
representation
of
the
lucretian
theory
of
fluidity
by
pictorial
diagrams
of
intersecting
planes
was
destined
to
revolutionize
human
society
was
beyond
her
comprehension
still
it
was
vastly
interesting
they
got
their
into
sculpture
into
poetry
in
some
queer
way
into
sociology
a
dingy
young
painter
meagerly
hirsute
and
a
pallid
young
woman
of
anarchical
politics
assembled
the
crew
one
evening
and
taking
hands
announced
the
fact
of
their
temporary
marriage
the
temporary
bridegroom
made
a
speech
which
was
enthusiastically
acclaimed
their
association
was
connected
so
camilla
understood
with
some
sublime
quality
inherent
in
the
intersecting
planes
in
these
various
pairings
gleamed
none
of
the
old
latin
quarter
joyousness
their
immorality
was
most
austere
to
camilla
it
was
all
new
and
startling
a
phantasmagorical
world
free
love
the
merest
commonplace
and
after
a
short
while
into
this
poisonous
atmosphere
wherein
she
dwelt
there
came
two
influences
one
was
the
vigilancy
of
the
women
social
and
political
union
the
other
harry
shileto
a
young
architect
a
healthy
man
in
the
midst
of
an
unhealthy
tribe
first
young
shileto
it
is
not
that
he
differed
much
from
the
rest
of
the
crew
in
crazy
theory
he
maintained
like
everyone
else
that
raphael
and
brunelleschi
had
retarded
the
progress
of
the
world
for
a
thousand
years
he
despised
debussy
for
a
anarchist
he
lamented
the
failure
of
the
architectural
iconoclasts
of
the
late
his
professed
contempt
for
all
human
activities
outside
the
pale
of
the
slum
was
colossal
on
the
slum
he
was
sound
nay
enthusiastic
but
he
was
physically
clean
physically
a
man
and
as
camilla
too
practised
cleanliness
of
person
they
were
drawn
together
and
at
the
same
time
the
cold
relentless
hand
of
the
great
feminist
organization
got
her
in
its
grip
blindly
acting
under
orders
she
interrupted
meetings
broke
windows
went
to
prison
shrieked
at
the
independence
of
her
sex
and
then
she
came
down
on
the
of
a
sex
by
no
means
so
independent
on
the
contrary
imperiously
tyrannically
dependent
on
hers
the
theories
of
the
slum
uncompromisingly
suffragist
were
all
very
well
they
might
be
practised
with
impunity
by
the
anemic
and
slatternly
but
when
harry
shileto
entered
into
the
bond
with
camilla
the
instinct
of
the
honest
briton
clamored
for
the
comforts
of
a
home
as
all
the
time
that
she
could
spare
from
the
neglect
of
her
studies
at
the
hospital
was
devoted
to
feminist
rioting
and
a
mere
rag
of
a
thing
came
back
at
night
to
the
flat
the
young
man
rebelled
you
ca
love
and
look
after
me
and
fool
about
in
prison
at
the
same
time
the
two
things
do
hold
together
and
camilla
her
nerves
a
jangle
i
am
neither
your
odalisk
nor
your
housekeeper
so
your
remark
does
not
apply
oh
the
squalid
squabbles
and
then
at
last
camilla
he
gave
her
a
letter
to
read
i
fed
up
with
all
this
rot
she
glanced
over
the
letter
are
you
going
to
accept
this
post
in
canada
she
asked
sourly
not
if
you
promise
to
chuck
the
militant
business
and
also
these
epicene
freaks
in
chelsea
i
should
like
you
to
carry
on
at
the
hospital
until
you
qualified
you
seem
to
forget
she
said
that
i
like
a
soldier
under
orders
if
necessary
i
must
sacrifice
my
medical
career
i
also
think
your
remarks
about
the
brotherhood
simply
beastly
i
do
no
such
thing
eventually
it
came
to
this
i
do
care
whether
women
get
the
vote
or
not
i
think
our
chelsea
friends
are
the
most
pestilential
set
of
rotters
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
got
my
way
to
make
in
the
world
help
me
to
do
it
let
us
get
married
in
decent
fashion
and
go
out
together
i
being
just
the
appanage
of
the
rising
young
architect
thank
you
for
the
insult
and
so
the
argument
went
on
until
he
delivered
his
ultimatum
if
i
do
get
a
sensible
message
by
twelve
at
the
club
i
never
see
or
hear
of
you
as
long
as
i
live
he
went
out
of
the
flat
she
sent
no
message
he
did
not
return
after
a
while
a
lawyer
came
and
equitably
adjusted
joint
financial
responsibilities
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
romance
if
romance
it
could
be
termed
from
that
day
to
this
harry
shileto
had
vanished
from
her
ken
his
exit
had
been
the
end
of
the
romance
but
it
had
marked
the
beginning
of
tragedy
a
man
can
love
and
however
justifiably
ride
away
gloriously
free
but
the
woman
for
all
her
clamoring
insistence
has
to
pay
the
debt
from
which
man
is
physically
exempt
harry
shileto
had
already
arrived
in
canada
when
camilla
discovered
the
dismaying
fact
of
her
sex
disability
but
her
pride
kept
her
silent
and
of
the
child
born
in
secret
and
dead
within
a
fortnight
harry
shileto
never
heard
then
after
a
few
months
of
dejection
and
loss
of
bearings
and
lassitude
the
war
thundered
on
the
world
her
friend
john
donovan
the
surgeon
was
going
out
to
france
she
went
to
him
and
said
i
wasted
my
time
it
will
take
years
for
me
to
qualify
let
me
go
out
and
nurse
so
through
his
influence
she
had
stepped
into
the
midst
of
the
suffering
of
the
war
and
there
she
still
remained
and
found
great
happiness
in
great
work
at
length
she
drew
her
hands
from
her
brow
and
went
and
poured
out
some
water
for
her
throat
was
parched
on
catching
sight
of
herself
in
the
mirror
she
paused
she
was
pale
and
worn
and
there
were
hollows
beneath
her
eyes
catching
shadows
but
the
war
had
not
altogether
marred
her
face
she
took
off
her
and
revealed
dark
hair
full
and
glossy
she
half
wondered
why
the
passage
of
a
hundred
years
had
not
turned
it
white
then
she
sat
again
on
the
bed
and
gripped
her
hands
together
my
god
what
am
i
going
to
do
had
she
loved
him
she
did
not
know
her
association
with
him
could
not
have
been
entirely
the
callous
execution
of
a
social
theory
there
must
have
been
irradiating
gleams
or
had
she
wilfully
excluded
them
from
her
soul
once
she
had
needed
him
and
cried
for
him
but
that
was
in
an
hour
of
weakness
which
she
had
conquered
and
now
how
could
she
face
him
still
less
live
in
that
terrible
intimacy
of
patient
and
nurse
oh
the
miserable
shame
of
it
all
her
womanhood
shivered
yet
she
must
go
through
the
ordeal
his
bandaged
eyes
promised
a
short
time
of
probation
in
the
morning
after
a
restless
night
she
pulled
herself
together
after
all
what
need
for
such
a
commotion
if
the
three
and
a
half
years
of
war
had
not
taught
her
dignity
and
she
had
learned
but
little
there
were
four
beds
in
the
ward
two
on
the
right
were
occupied
by
officers
one
with
an
another
with
a
hole
through
his
body
the
third
on
the
left
by
a
boy
with
a
shattered
knee
which
as
the
night
sister
told
her
gave
him
unceasing
pain
the
fourth
by
major
shileto
to
him
she
went
first
and
whispered
i
the
day
sister
what
kind
of
a
night
have
you
had
splendid
his
lips
curled
in
a
pleasant
smile
just
one
long
beautiful
blank
and
the
head
jammy
that
what
it
feels
like
how
it
looks
i
do
know
we
see
later
when
i
do
the
dressings
she
went
off
to
the
boy
he
also
was
a
canadian
officer
and
his
name
was
robin
mckay
she
lingered
awhile
in
talk
strikes
me
my
military
career
is
over
and
i
just
have
to
hump
round
real
estate
in
winnipeg
on
a
wooden
leg
they
are
going
to
cut
your
leg
off
you
silly
boy
she
laughed
and
what
do
you
mean
by
round
real
estate
i
a
land
surveyor
that
to
say
my
father
is
see
here
when
are
they
going
to
send
me
back
i
afraid
of
this
country
why
it
so
lonesome
i
do
know
a
soul
we
fix
that
up
all
right
for
you
she
said
cheerily
worry
the
morning
routine
of
the
hospital
began
in
its
appointed
course
came
the
time
for
dressings
camilla
her
nerves
under
control
went
to
shileto
i
got
to
worry
you
but
i
try
to
hurt
as
little
as
i
can
go
ahead
never
mind
me
a
probationer
stood
by
serving
the
laden
at
first
the
symmetrically
bandaged
head
seemed
that
of
a
thousand
cases
with
which
she
had
dealt
but
when
the
crisp
brown
hair
came
to
view
her
hand
trembled
ever
so
little
she
avoided
touching
it
as
far
as
was
possible
for
she
remembered
its
feel
dead
forgotten
words
rose
lambent
in
her
memory
crackles
like
a
cat
back
let
me
see
if
there
are
but
in
the
midst
of
a
great
shaven
patch
there
was
a
horrible
which
claimed
her
deftest
skill
and
she
worked
with
steady
fingers
and
uncovered
the
maimed
brows
and
eyelids
and
cheekbones
how
the
sight
had
been
preserved
was
a
miracle
she
cleansed
the
wounds
with
antiseptics
and
freed
the
eyelashes
she
bent
over
him
with
deliberate
intent
you
can
open
your
eyes
for
a
second
or
two
you
can
see
all
right
rather
i
can
see
your
belt
hold
on
then
with
her
swift
craft
she
blindfolded
him
anew
completed
the
bandaging
laid
him
back
on
his
pillow
and
went
off
with
the
probationer
wheeling
the
table
to
the
other
cases
later
in
the
day
she
was
doing
him
some
trivial
service
what
the
good
of
lying
in
bed
all
day
he
asked
i
want
to
get
up
and
walk
about
you
got
a
bit
of
a
temperature
how
much
point
eight
call
that
a
temperature
i
gone
about
with
a
hundred
and
three
when
was
that
when
i
first
went
out
to
canada
i
english
you
know
only
left
the
old
country
in
nineteen
thirteen
but
when
the
war
broke
out
i
joined
up
with
the
first
batch
of
canadians
lucky
to
start
with
a
commission
lord
it
was
hell
delight
so
i
been
given
to
understand
said
camilla
but
what
about
your
temperature
of
a
hundred
and
three
i
was
a
young
fool
said
he
and
i
did
care
what
happened
to
me
why
she
asked
for
a
while
he
did
not
answer
he
bit
his
lower
lip
showing
just
a
fine
line
of
white
teeth
memory
again
clutched
her
she
was
also
struck
by
his
unconscious
realization
of
the
aging
quality
of
the
war
in
that
he
spoke
of
his
self
as
a
young
fool
so
far
as
that
went
they
thought
in
common
presently
he
said
your
voice
reminds
me
of
some
one
i
used
to
know
where
oh
here
in
london
she
lied
instinctively
with
a
laugh
it
could
have
been
me
i
only
just
come
to
london
and
never
met
major
shileto
before
in
my
life
of
course
not
he
asserted
readily
but
i
had
no
idea
two
human
voices
could
be
so
nearly
identical
still
she
remarked
you
have
told
me
of
the
temperature
of
a
hundred
and
three
oh
it
is
no
story
your
voice
brought
it
all
back
you
heard
of
a
man
own
angry
pride
being
cap
and
bells
for
a
fool
well
he
laughed
apologetically
it
idiotic
there
no
point
in
it
i
just
went
about
for
a
week
in
a
canadian
winter
with
that
temperature
that
all
because
you
could
bear
to
lie
alone
and
think
that
about
it
sister
cried
the
boy
robin
mckay
from
the
next
bed
she
obeyed
the
summons
what
was
the
matter
everything
seems
to
have
got
mixed
up
and
my
knee
hurting
like
fury
she
attended
to
his
crumpled
bedclothes
cracked
a
little
joke
which
made
him
laugh
then
the
two
other
men
claimed
her
notice
she
carried
on
her
work
outwardly
calm
smiling
the
perfectly
trained
woman
of
the
war
but
her
heart
was
beating
in
an
unaccustomed
way
her
ministrations
over
she
left
the
ward
for
duty
elsewhere
at
she
returned
and
aided
the
blindfolded
man
to
get
through
the
meal
the
dread
of
the
morning
had
given
place
to
mingled
wonder
and
timidity
he
had
gone
off
on
the
hot
speed
of
their
last
quarrel
out
of
her
life
save
for
a
short
anguished
period
during
which
she
had
lost
she
had
never
reproached
him
she
had
asserted
her
freedom
he
had
asserted
his
nay
more
he
had
held
the
door
open
for
a
way
out
from
an
impossible
situation
and
she
had
slammed
the
door
in
his
face
in
those
days
centered
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
in
human
suffering
she
had
thought
little
of
the
man
feelings
he
had
gone
away
and
forgotten
or
done
his
best
to
forget
an
ugly
memory
her
last
night
review
of
ghosts
had
proved
the
of
any
illusions
among
them
but
now
now
that
the
chances
of
war
had
brought
them
again
together
the
sound
of
her
voice
had
conjured
up
in
him
too
the
ghosts
of
the
past
she
had
been
responsible
for
his
with
a
temperature
of
a
hundred
and
three
and
for
his
not
caring
what
happened
to
him
he
had
lifted
the
corner
of
a
curtain
revealing
the
possibility
of
happenings
you
were
quoting
tennyson
just
now
she
remarked
was
i
your
speech
oh
yes
what
about
it
i
was
only
wondering
like
a
woman
you
resent
a
she
drew
in
a
sharp
little
breath
the
words
the
tone
stabbed
her
she
might
have
been
talking
to
him
in
one
of
their
pleasanter
hours
in
the
chelsea
flat
in
spite
of
her
burning
curiosity
she
said
not
a
woman
i
a
nurse
since
when
as
far
as
you
people
are
concerned
since
september
when
i
went
out
to
france
i
been
through
everything
from
the
casualty
base
hospitals
and
now
i
here
having
a
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
men
have
told
me
their
troubles
so
i
got
to
regard
myself
as
a
sort
of
mother
confessor
he
smiled
then
like
a
mother
confessor
you
resent
a
she
put
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
and
lit
it
for
him
it
all
depends
she
said
lightly
whether
you
want
absolution
or
not
i
suppose
it
the
same
old
story
she
held
her
voice
in
command
every
man
thinks
it
original
what
kind
of
a
woman
was
she
he
parried
the
thrust
is
that
rather
too
direct
a
question
even
for
a
mother
confessor
you
be
spilling
ash
all
over
the
bed
here
an
she
guided
his
hand
then
you
do
want
absolution
oh
yes
i
do
but
you
see
i
not
yet
articulo
so
i
put
off
my
confession
anyhow
you
loved
the
woman
you
treated
badly
the
question
was
as
casual
as
she
could
make
it
while
she
settled
the
on
the
tray
it
was
a
girl
not
a
woman
what
has
become
of
her
that
what
i
should
like
to
know
but
you
loved
her
of
course
i
did
i
not
a
blackguard
of
course
i
loved
her
her
pulses
quickened
but
much
water
has
run
under
london
bridge
since
then
and
much
blood
has
flowed
in
france
everything
lives
habits
modes
of
thought
have
been
revolutionized
yes
he
reflected
for
a
moment
it
odd
how
you
have
brought
back
old
days
i
fell
in
with
a
pestilential
artistic
crowd
i
am
an
architect
by
profession
you
know
men
with
long
greasy
hair
and
dirty
finger
nails
and
anarchical
views
there
was
one
chap
especially
who
i
thought
was
decadent
to
the
bone
aloysius
eglington
he
called
himself
the
man
sprang
vivid
to
her
memory
he
had
once
tried
to
make
love
to
her
well
i
came
across
him
the
other
day
with
a
couple
of
and
the
ribbon
for
a
man
like
that
what
an
upheaval
he
laughed
again
i
suppose
been
a
bit
upheaved
myself
i
beginning
to
piece
together
your
story
of
the
temperature
she
said
pleasantly
i
suppose
the
girl
was
one
of
the
young
females
of
this
anarchical
crowd
obviously
the
phrase
jarred
i
could
never
regard
her
in
that
light
he
said
coldly
the
war
has
got
hold
of
her
too
i
suppose
no
doubt
she
was
a
medical
student
may
i
have
another
cigarette
his
tone
signified
the
end
of
the
topic
she
smiled
for
her
was
a
triumph
the
probationer
came
up
and
took
away
the
camilla
left
her
patient
and
went
to
the
other
beds
that
night
again
she
sat
alone
in
her
little
white
room
and
thought
and
thought
she
had
started
the
day
with
plans
of
flight
before
her
identity
could
be
discovered
she
was
there
voluntarily
purely
as
an
act
of
grace
she
could
walk
out
without
reproach
at
a
moment
notice
but
now
had
not
the
situation
changed
to
her
as
to
a
stranger
he
had
confessed
his
love
she
had
not
dared
probe
deeper
but
might
not
a
deeper
probing
have
brought
to
light
something
abiding
and
beautiful
in
the
war
she
had
accomplished
her
womanhood
proudly
and
rightly
she
recognized
her
development
he
too
had
accomplished
his
manhood
and
his
dear
face
would
be
maimed
and
scarred
for
the
rest
of
his
life
then
with
the
suddenness
of
a
tropical
storm
a
wave
of
intolerable
emotion
surged
through
her
she
uttered
a
little
cry
and
broke
into
a
passion
of
tears
and
so
her
love
was
reborn
professional
to
the
tips
of
her
cool
fingers
she
dressed
his
wounds
the
next
morning
but
she
did
not
lure
him
back
across
the
years
the
present
held
its
own
happiness
tremulous
in
its
delicacy
it
was
he
who
questioned
whereabouts
in
france
had
she
been
she
replied
with
scraps
of
anecdote
there
was
little
of
war
horror
and
peril
through
which
she
had
not
passed
she
explained
her
present
position
in
the
hospital
by
george
you
splendid
he
cried
i
wish
i
could
have
a
look
at
you
you
lost
your
chance
for
she
answered
gaily
for
she
had
completed
the
bandaging
after
dinner
she
went
out
and
walked
the
streets
in
a
a
soft
light
in
her
eyes
the
moment
of
recognition
and
it
was
bound
soon
to
come
could
not
fail
in
its
touch
of
sanctification
its
touch
of
beauty
he
and
she
had
passed
through
fires
of
hell
and
had
emerged
purified
and
tempered
they
were
the
greatest
gift
of
god
miraculously
regiven
they
could
not
again
despise
on
that
dreary
afternoon
oxford
street
hummed
with
joy
only
a
freak
of
chance
had
hitherto
preserved
her
anonymity
a
reference
by
matron
or
probationer
to
sister
warrington
would
betray
her
instantly
should
she
await
or
anticipate
betrayal
in
a
fluttering
tumult
of
indecision
she
returned
to
the
hospital
the
had
begun
when
she
had
taken
off
her
outdoor
things
she
looked
into
the
ward
around
the
two
beds
on
the
right
little
groups
of
friends
were
stationed
the
boy
robin
mckay
in
the
bed
nearest
the
door
on
the
left
caught
sight
of
her
and
summoned
her
sister
come
and
pretend
to
be
a
visitor
there
not
a
soul
in
this
country
who
could
possibly
come
to
see
me
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
homesick
she
sat
by
his
side
all
right
imagine
i
an
elderly
maiden
aunt
from
the
country
you
he
cried
with
overseas
frankness
you
only
a
kid
yourself
major
shileto
overheard
and
laughed
she
blushed
and
half
rose
that
not
the
way
to
treat
visitors
mr
mckay
the
boy
stretched
out
his
hand
i
awfully
sorry
if
i
was
rude
do
go
she
yielded
all
the
same
she
said
you
have
to
get
used
to
a
bit
of
loneliness
it
ca
be
helped
besides
you
not
the
only
tiger
that
has
got
a
christian
there
major
shileto
and
you
can
read
and
he
ca
the
voice
came
from
the
next
bed
do
worry
about
me
talk
to
the
boy
i
have
some
one
to
see
me
he
wo
poor
old
chap
have
a
game
of
chess
said
the
boy
with
pleasure
she
fetched
the
board
and
chessmen
from
the
long
table
running
down
the
center
of
the
ward
and
they
set
out
the
pieces
i
reckon
to
be
rather
good
said
he
perhaps
i
might
give
you
something
i
rather
good
myself
she
replied
i
was
taught
by
she
stopped
short
on
the
brink
of
pronouncing
the
name
of
the
young
polish
master
who
lived
in
a
very
material
sense
on
the
fringe
of
the
chelsea
crew
we
start
even
at
any
rate
they
began
she
realized
that
the
boy
had
not
boasted
and
soon
she
became
absorbed
in
the
game
so
intent
was
she
on
the
problem
presented
by
a
brilliant
and
unexpected
move
on
his
part
that
she
did
not
notice
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
swift
passage
of
a
figure
behind
her
chair
it
was
a
cry
that
startled
her
a
cry
of
surprise
and
joy
a
cry
of
the
heart
marjorie
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
figure
that
of
a
girl
with
fair
hair
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
and
harry
shileto
arms
were
round
her
and
his
lips
to
hers
she
stared
frozen
she
heard
i
did
expect
you
till
i
just
had
time
to
catch
the
train
at
inverness
i
not
brought
an
ounce
of
luggage
oh
my
poor
poor
old
harry
it
was
horrible
the
boy
said
never
mind
sister
he
got
his
christian
all
right
let
get
on
with
the
game
mechanically
obeying
a
professional
instinct
she
looked
at
the
swimming
and
made
a
move
haphazard
i
say
that
wo
do
cried
the
boy
it
mate
for
me
in
two
moves
buck
up
with
a
great
effort
she
caught
the
vanishing
tail
of
her
previous
calculation
and
made
a
move
which
happened
to
be
correct
that
better
he
said
i
hoped
you
would
spot
it
but
i
could
let
you
play
the
ass
with
your
knight
and
spoil
the
game
now
this
demands
deep
consideration
he
lingered
a
while
over
his
move
she
looked
across
the
pair
at
the
next
bed
were
talking
in
whispers
the
girl
was
now
sitting
on
the
chair
by
the
bedside
and
her
back
hid
the
face
of
the
man
though
her
head
was
near
his
there
cried
the
boy
triumphantly
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
see
it
oh
i
say
his
finger
indicated
the
move
with
half
her
brain
at
work
she
moved
a
pawn
a
cautious
step
the
boy
whole
heart
was
in
his
offensive
he
swooped
a
bishop
triumphantly
athwart
the
board
there
only
one
thing
can
save
you
for
mate
in
five
moves
i
know
it
is
the
proper
thing
to
be
chatting
over
chess
but
i
like
it
chatty
by
nature
only
one
course
open
to
save
me
from
destruction
she
murmured
just
one
and
she
heard
from
the
next
bed
are
you
sure
darling
you
only
saying
it
to
break
the
shock
gently
are
you
sure
your
eyes
are
all
right
perfectly
certain
i
wish
i
could
have
real
proof
camilla
stared
at
the
blankness
of
her
vanished
dream
come
along
sister
put
your
back
into
it
chuckled
robin
mckay
she
held
her
brows
tight
with
her
hands
and
strove
to
concentrate
her
tortured
mind
on
the
board
her
heart
was
in
agony
of
desolation
the
soft
murmurings
she
could
not
but
overhear
pierced
her
brain
the
poignant
shame
of
her
disillusionment
burned
her
from
head
to
foot
again
she
heard
the
girl
pleading
voice
only
for
a
minute
it
could
hurt
the
boy
said
buck
up
just
one
tiny
at
the
end
of
her
tether
she
cried
the
only
way
out
i
give
it
up
and
swept
the
pieces
over
the
board
she
rose
stood
transfixed
with
horror
and
sense
of
outrage
harry
shileto
propped
on
pillows
was
unwinding
the
bandages
from
his
mangled
head
devils
within
her
clamored
for
hysterical
outcry
but
something
physical
happened
and
checked
the
breath
that
was
about
to
utter
his
christian
name
the
boy
had
gripped
her
arm
with
all
his
young
strength
in
passionate
remonstrance
oh
dear
old
thing
do
play
the
game
i
sorry
she
said
and
he
released
her
so
she
passed
swiftly
round
the
boy
bed
to
that
of
the
foolish
patient
and
arrested
his
hand
major
shileto
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
the
girl
who
was
very
pretty
turned
on
her
an
alarmed
and
tearful
face
it
was
my
fault
sister
oh
can
i
believe
him
you
can
believe
me
at
any
rate
she
replied
with
asperity
swiftly
readjusting
the
bandage
major
shileto
sight
is
unaffected
but
if
i
had
not
been
here
and
he
had
succeeded
in
taking
off
his
dressings
god
knows
what
would
have
happened
major
shileto
i
put
you
on
your
honor
not
to
do
such
a
silly
thing
again
all
right
sister
he
said
with
a
little
twitch
of
the
lips
the
girl
rose
and
drew
her
a
step
aside
do
forgive
me
sister
we
have
only
been
married
five
months
when
he
was
last
home
on
leave
and
you
understand
do
you
what
it
would
have
meant
to
me
if
of
course
i
do
anyhow
you
can
be
perfectly
reassured
but
i
must
warn
you
she
whispered
and
looked
through
narrowed
eyelids
into
the
girl
eyes
he
may
be
dreadfully
disfigured
the
girl
shrank
terrified
but
she
cried
i
hope
i
shall
love
him
all
the
more
for
it
i
hope
so
too
replied
camilla
soberly
i
say
she
added
in
a
louder
tone
holding
out
her
hand
i
see
you
again
the
girl
asked
politely
i
afraid
not
what
that
cried
shileto
i
told
you
i
was
only
here
as
a
bird
of
passage
my
time
up
i
awfully
sorry
they
shook
hands
camilla
went
to
robin
mckay
and
bent
over
him
you
quite
right
my
dear
boy
one
ought
to
play
the
game
to
the
bitter
end
it
the
thing
most
worth
doing
in
life
god
bless
you
the
boy
stared
wonderingly
at
her
as
she
disappeared
i
glad
she
not
going
to
be
here
any
more
said
the
girl
her
husband
lips
smiled
why
she
a
most
heartless
overbearing
woman
oh
they
all
seem
like
that
when
they
upset
he
laughed
and
i
was
really
playing
the
most
outrageous
fool
she
put
her
head
close
to
him
and
whispered
do
you
guess
why
i
was
so
madly
anxious
to
know
that
you
could
see
she
told
him
and
from
that
moment
the
possessor
of
the
remembered
voice
faded
from
his
memory
camilla
went
to
the
matron
i
sorry
but
i
bitten
off
more
than
i
can
chew
if
i
go
on
an
hour
longer
i
break
down
i
due
in
france
in
a
fortnight
and
i
must
have
my
rest
i
can
only
thank
you
for
your
help
said
the
matron
but
four
days
later
ten
days
before
her
leave
had
expired
camilla
appeared
at
the
casualty
in
france
of
which
she
was
a
what
the
devil
are
you
here
for
asked
the
amazed
commanding
medical
officer
england
too
full
of
ghosts
they
scared
me
back
to
realities
the
laughed
to
hide
his
inability
to
understand
well
if
you
like
it
all
the
same
to
me
i
delighted
to
have
you
but
give
me
the
good
old
ghosts
of
blighty
all
the
time
the
piercing
of
the
line
at
cambrai
was
a
surprise
no
less
to
the
germans
than
to
the
british
the
great
tent
of
the
casualty
was
crammed
with
wounded
doctors
and
nurses
with
tense
burning
eyes
and
bodies
aching
from
strain
worked
and
worked
and
thought
nothing
of
that
which
might
be
passing
outside
no
one
knew
that
the
german
wave
had
passed
over
and
the
german
wave
itself
at
that
part
of
the
line
was
but
a
set
of
straggling
and
mystified
groups
camilla
warrington
head
of
the
heroic
host
of
women
working
in
the
dimly
lit
reek
of
blood
and
agony
had
not
slept
for
two
nights
and
two
days
the
last
convoy
of
wounded
had
poured
in
a
couple
of
hours
before
she
stood
by
the
surgeon
aiding
him
the
perfect
machine
at
last
in
the
terrible
rota
they
came
to
a
man
swathed
round
the
middle
in
the
rough
bandages
of
the
field
he
was
unconscious
they
unwound
him
and
revealed
a
sight
of
unimaginable
horror
he
no
good
poor
chap
said
the
surgeon
ca
you
try
she
asked
and
put
repressing
hands
on
the
wounded
man
not
the
slightest
good
said
the
medical
officer
no
one
in
the
great
tent
of
agony
knew
that
they
were
isolated
from
the
british
army
from
the
outside
it
looked
solitary
lighted
and
secure
two
german
soldiers
casual
stragglers
looked
in
at
the
door
of
the
great
tent
in
the
kindly
german
way
they
each
threw
in
a
bomb
and
ran
off
laughing
seven
men
were
killed
outright
and
many
rewounded
and
camilla
warrington
was
killed
the
bloody
and
hideous
incident
related
here
is
not
an
invention
it
is
true
it
happened
when
and
where
i
have
the
guards
in
their
memorable
sweep
cleared
the
ground
the
casualty
again
came
into
british
hands
there
is
a
grave
in
that
region
whose
states
that
it
is
consecrated
to
the
heroic
memory
of
camilla
warrington
one
of
the
great
women
of
the
war
and
marjorie
shileto
to
her
husband
healed
and
sound
searching
like
a
foolish
woman
deep
into
his
past
history
it
awfully
decent
of
you
darling
to
hide
nothing
from
me
and
to
tell
me
about
that
girl
in
chelsea
but
what
was
she
like
my
sweetheart
said
he
like
a
foolish
man
she
was
worth
your
little
finger
the
princess
kingdom
that
there
was
once
a
real
prince
rabomirski
is
beyond
question
that
he
was
ottilie
father
may
be
taken
for
granted
but
that
the
princess
rabomirski
had
a
right
to
bear
the
title
many
folks
were
scandalously
prepared
to
deny
it
is
true
that
when
the
news
of
the
prince
death
reached
monte
carlo
the
princess
who
was
there
at
the
time
showed
various
persons
on
whose
indiscretion
she
could
rely
a
holograph
letter
of
condolence
from
the
tsar
and
later
unfolded
to
the
amiable
the
intricacies
of
a
lawsuit
which
she
was
instituting
for
the
recovery
of
the
estates
in
poland
but
her
detractors
roundly
declared
the
holograph
letter
to
be
a
forgery
and
the
lawsuit
a
fiction
of
her
crafty
brain
princess
however
she
continued
to
style
herself
in
cosmopolis
and
princess
she
was
styled
by
all
and
sundry
and
little
ottilie
rabomirski
was
called
the
princess
ottilie
among
the
people
who
joined
heart
and
soul
with
the
detractors
was
young
vince
somerset
if
there
was
one
person
whom
he
despised
and
hated
more
than
count
bernheim
of
the
holy
roman
empire
it
was
the
princess
rabomirski
in
his
eyes
she
was
everything
that
a
princess
a
lady
a
woman
and
a
mother
should
not
be
she
dressed
ten
years
younger
than
was
seemly
she
spoke
english
like
a
barmaid
and
french
like
a
cocotte
she
gambled
her
way
through
europe
from
year
end
to
year
end
and
after
neglecting
ottilie
for
twenty
years
she
was
about
to
marry
her
to
bernheim
the
last
was
the
unforgivable
offence
the
young
man
walked
up
and
down
the
casino
terrace
of
and
poured
into
a
friend
ear
his
flaming
indignation
he
was
nine
and
twenty
and
though
he
pursued
the
unpoetical
avocation
of
the
foreign
telegrams
on
a
london
daily
newspaper
retained
some
of
the
vehemence
of
undergraduate
days
when
he
had
chosen
the
career
now
abandoned
of
poet
artist
dramatist
and
irreconcilable
politician
look
at
them
he
cried
indicating
a
couple
seated
at
a
distant
table
beneath
the
awning
of
the
café
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
horrible
in
your
life
the
maiden
and
the
minotaur
when
i
heard
of
the
engagement
i
would
believe
it
until
she
herself
told
me
she
does
know
the
man
abomination
he
a
of
reproach
through
europe
his
name
stinks
like
his
infernal
body
the
live
air
reeks
with
the
scent
he
pours
upon
himself
there
can
be
no
turpitude
under
the
sun
in
which
the
wretch
does
wallow
do
you
know
that
he
killed
his
first
wife
oh
i
do
mean
that
he
cut
her
throat
that
far
too
primitive
for
such
a
complex
hound
there
are
other
ways
of
murdering
a
woman
my
dear
ross
you
kick
her
body
and
break
her
heart
and
defile
her
soul
that
what
he
did
and
he
has
done
it
to
other
women
but
my
dear
man
remarked
ross
elderly
and
cynical
he
is
colossally
rich
rich
do
you
know
where
he
made
his
money
in
the
cesspool
of
european
finance
he
a
jew
by
race
a
german
by
parentage
an
italian
by
upbringing
and
a
greek
by
profession
he
has
and
cribs
and
rotten
companies
all
over
the
continent
do
you
remember
sequasto
and
that
was
bernheim
england
too
hot
to
hold
him
look
at
him
now
he
has
taken
off
his
hat
do
you
know
why
he
wears
his
greasy
hair
plastered
over
half
his
damned
forehead
it
to
hide
the
mark
of
the
beast
he
antichrist
and
when
i
think
of
that
jezebel
from
the
mile
end
road
putting
ottilie
into
his
arms
it
makes
me
see
red
by
heavens
it
touch
and
go
that
i
do
slay
the
pair
of
them
very
likely
they
not
as
bad
as
they
painted
said
his
friend
she
could
be
somerset
retorted
grimly
ross
laughed
looked
at
his
watch
and
announced
that
it
was
time
for
the
young
man
assented
moodily
and
they
crossed
the
terrace
to
the
café
tables
beneath
the
awning
it
was
the
dying
afternoon
of
a
sultry
august
day
and
most
of
illerville
had
deserted
tennis
courts
aux
and
other
distractions
to
listen
lazily
to
the
band
in
the
casino
shade
the
place
was
crowded
not
a
table
vacant
when
the
waiter
at
last
brought
one
from
the
interior
of
the
café
he
dumped
it
down
beside
the
table
occupied
by
the
unspeakable
bernheim
and
the
little
princess
ottilie
somerset
raised
his
hat
as
he
took
his
seat
bernheim
responded
with
elaborate
politeness
and
princess
ottilie
greeted
him
with
a
faint
smile
the
engaged
pair
spoke
very
little
to
each
other
bernheim
lounged
back
in
his
chair
smoking
a
cigar
and
looked
out
to
sea
with
a
bored
expression
when
the
girl
made
a
casual
remark
he
nodded
rudely
without
turning
his
head
somerset
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
kick
him
his
external
appearance
was
of
the
type
that
irritated
the
young
englishman
he
was
too
handsome
in
a
hard
swaggering
way
he
exaggerated
to
offence
the
english
style
of
easy
dress
he
wore
a
too
panama
a
too
obtrusive
coloured
shirt
and
club
tie
he
wore
no
waistcoat
and
the
hem
of
his
new
flannel
trousers
turned
up
six
inches
disclosed
a
stretch
of
silk
socks
clocked
with
gold
matching
elegant
tan
shoes
he
went
about
with
a
poodle
he
was
inordinately
scented
somerset
glowered
at
him
and
let
his
drink
remain
untasted
presently
bernheim
summoned
the
waiter
paid
him
for
the
tea
the
girl
had
been
drinking
and
pushed
back
his
chair
this
hole
is
getting
on
my
nerves
he
said
in
french
to
his
companion
i
am
going
into
the
to
play
écarté
will
you
go
to
your
mother
whom
i
see
over
there
or
will
you
stay
here
i
stay
here
said
the
little
princess
ottilie
bernheim
nodded
and
swaggered
off
somerset
bent
forward
i
must
see
you
alone
quite
alone
i
must
have
you
all
to
myself
how
can
you
manage
it
ottilie
looked
at
him
anxiously
she
was
fair
and
innocent
of
a
prettiness
more
english
than
foreign
and
the
scare
in
her
blue
eyes
made
them
all
the
more
appealing
to
the
young
man
what
is
the
good
you
ca
help
me
do
you
see
that
it
is
all
arranged
i
undertake
to
disarrange
it
at
a
moment
notice
said
somerset
hush
she
whispered
glancing
round
somebody
will
hear
everything
is
gossiped
about
in
this
place
well
will
you
meet
me
the
young
man
persisted
if
i
can
she
sighed
if
they
are
both
playing
baccarat
i
may
slip
out
for
a
little
as
at
spa
she
smiled
and
a
slight
flush
came
into
her
cheek
yes
as
at
spa
wait
for
me
on
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
casino
steps
now
i
must
go
to
my
mother
she
would
not
like
to
see
me
talking
to
you
the
princess
hates
me
like
poison
do
you
know
why
no
and
you
are
not
going
to
tell
me
she
said
demurely
when
she
had
passed
out
of
earshot
ross
touched
the
young
man
arm
i
afraid
my
dear
somerset
you
are
playing
a
particularly
silly
fool
game
have
you
never
played
it
heaven
forbid
it
would
be
a
precious
sight
better
for
you
if
you
had
growled
somerset
i
take
another
quinquina
said
ross
did
you
see
the
way
in
which
the
brute
treated
her
somerset
exclaimed
angrily
if
it
like
that
before
marriage
what
will
it
be
after
plenty
of
money
separate
establishments
perfect
independence
and
happiness
for
each
somerset
rose
from
the
table
there
are
times
my
good
ross
said
he
when
i
absolutely
hate
you
somerset
had
first
met
the
princess
rabomirski
and
her
daughter
three
years
before
at
spa
they
were
staying
at
the
same
hotel
a
very
modest
one
which
to
somerset
mind
with
the
pretensions
bernheim
was
also
in
attendance
but
he
disposed
his
valet
his
and
himself
in
the
luxurious
hôtel
as
befitted
a
man
of
his
quality
also
he
was
in
attendance
not
on
ottilie
but
on
the
princess
who
at
that
time
was
three
years
younger
and
a
trifle
less
painted
now
at
the
trio
were
stopping
at
the
hotel
splendide
a
sumptuous
hostelry
where
season
prices
were
far
above
somerset
moderate
means
he
contented
himself
with
the
little
hotel
next
door
and
hated
the
hotel
splendide
and
all
that
it
contained
save
ottilie
with
all
his
heart
but
at
spa
the
princess
was
evidently
in
low
water
from
which
she
did
not
seem
to
be
rescued
by
her
varying
luck
at
the
tables
ottilie
was
then
a
child
of
seventeen
and
somerset
was
less
attracted
by
her
delicate
beauty
than
by
her
extraordinary
loneliness
day
after
day
night
after
night
he
would
come
upon
her
sitting
solitary
on
one
of
the
settees
in
the
like
a
forgotten
fan
or
flower
or
wandering
wistfully
from
table
to
table
idly
watching
the
revolving
wheels
sometimes
she
would
pause
behind
her
mother
or
bernheim
chair
to
watch
their
game
but
the
princess
called
her
a
little
and
would
drive
her
away
in
the
mornings
or
on
other
rare
occasions
when
the
elder
inseparables
were
not
playing
roulette
ottilie
hovered
round
them
at
a
distance
as
disregarded
as
a
shadow
that
followed
them
in
space
of
less
dimensions
as
it
were
wherever
they
went
in
the
casino
rooms
if
men
spoke
to
her
she
replied
in
shy
monosyllables
and
shrank
away
somerset
who
had
made
regular
acquaintance
with
the
princess
at
the
hotel
and
taken
a
chivalrous
pity
on
the
loneliness
she
admitted
first
to
a
timid
friendship
and
then
to
a
childlike
intimacy
her
face
would
brighten
and
her
heart
beat
a
little
faster
when
she
saw
his
young
figure
appear
in
the
distance
for
she
knew
he
would
come
straight
to
her
and
take
her
from
the
hot
room
heavy
with
perfumes
and
tobacco
on
to
the
cool
balcony
and
talk
of
all
manner
of
pleasant
things
and
somerset
found
in
this
neglected
little
sham
princess
what
his
youth
was
pleased
to
designate
a
soul
those
were
idyllic
hours
the
princess
glad
to
get
the
embarrassing
child
out
of
the
way
took
no
notice
of
the
intimacy
somerset
fell
in
love
it
lasted
out
a
separation
during
which
he
did
not
hear
from
her
he
had
written
to
several
addresses
but
a
cold
post
office
returned
his
letters
undelivered
and
his
only
consolation
was
to
piece
together
from
various
sources
the
unedifying
histories
of
the
princess
rabomirski
and
the
count
bernheim
of
the
holy
roman
empire
he
came
to
for
an
august
holiday
the
first
thing
he
did
when
shown
into
his
hotel
bedroom
was
to
gaze
out
of
window
at
the
beach
and
the
sea
the
first
person
his
eyes
rested
upon
was
the
little
princess
ottilie
issuing
alone
as
usual
from
the
doors
of
the
next
hotel
he
had
been
at
illerville
a
fortnight
a
fortnight
of
painful
joy
things
had
changed
their
interviews
had
been
mostly
stolen
for
the
princess
rabomirski
had
rudely
declined
to
renew
the
acquaintance
and
had
forbidden
ottilie
to
speak
to
him
the
girl
though
apparently
as
much
neglected
as
ever
was
guarded
against
him
with
peculiar
ingenuity
somerset
aware
that
ottilie
now
grown
from
a
child
into
an
exquisitely
beautiful
and
marriageable
young
woman
was
destined
by
a
hardened
sinner
like
the
princess
for
a
wealthier
husband
than
a
poor
newspaper
man
with
no
particular
prospects
could
not
however
quite
understand
the
reasons
for
the
virulent
hatred
of
which
he
was
the
object
he
overheard
the
princess
one
day
cursing
her
daughter
in
execrable
german
for
having
acknowledged
his
bow
a
short
time
before
their
only
undisturbed
time
together
was
in
the
sea
during
the
bathing
hour
the
princess
hating
the
pebbly
beach
which
cut
to
pieces
her
shoes
never
watched
the
bathers
and
bernheim
did
not
bathe
somerset
prejudiced
declared
that
he
did
not
even
wash
but
remained
in
his
bedroom
till
the
hour
of
ottilie
attended
only
by
her
maid
came
down
to
the
water
edge
threw
off
her
and
plunging
into
the
water
found
somerset
waiting
now
somerset
was
a
strong
swimmer
moderately
proficient
at
all
games
as
a
boy
and
an
undergraduate
he
had
found
that
swimming
was
the
only
sport
in
which
he
excelled
and
he
had
cultivated
and
maintained
the
art
oddly
enough
the
little
princess
ottilie
in
spite
of
her
apparent
fragility
was
also
an
excellent
and
fearless
swimmer
she
had
another
queer
delight
for
a
creature
so
daintily
feminine
the
so
that
the
muscles
of
her
young
limbs
were
firm
and
well
ordered
but
the
sea
was
her
passion
if
an
additional
bond
between
somerset
and
herself
were
needed
it
would
have
been
this
yet
though
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
swim
far
away
into
the
loneliness
of
the
sea
with
the
object
of
one
affections
the
conditions
do
not
encourage
sustained
conversation
on
subjects
of
vital
interest
on
the
day
when
somerset
learned
that
his
little
princess
was
engaged
to
bernheim
he
burned
to
tell
her
more
than
could
be
spluttered
out
in
ten
fathoms
of
water
so
he
urged
her
to
an
assignation
at
ten
she
joined
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
casino
steps
the
shingly
beach
was
deserted
but
on
the
terrace
above
the
throng
was
great
owing
to
the
breathless
heat
of
the
night
thank
heaven
you
have
come
said
he
do
you
know
how
i
have
longed
for
you
she
glanced
up
wistfully
into
his
face
in
her
simple
cream
dress
and
burnt
straw
hat
adorned
with
white
roses
around
the
brim
she
looked
very
fair
and
childlike
you
must
say
such
things
she
whispered
they
are
wrong
now
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
i
wo
hear
of
it
said
somerset
it
is
a
horrible
nightmare
your
engagement
do
you
know
that
i
love
you
i
loved
you
the
first
minute
i
set
my
eyes
on
you
at
spa
princess
ottilie
sighed
and
they
walked
along
the
boards
behind
the
and
down
the
rattling
beach
to
the
shelter
of
a
fishing
boat
where
they
sat
down
screened
from
the
world
with
the
murmuring
sea
in
front
of
them
somerset
talked
of
his
love
and
the
hatefulness
of
bernheim
the
little
princess
sighed
again
i
have
worse
news
still
she
said
it
will
pain
you
we
are
going
to
paris
and
then
on
to
they
have
just
decided
they
say
the
baccarat
here
is
silly
and
they
might
as
well
play
for
so
we
must
say
and
it
will
be
for
always
i
will
come
to
said
somerset
no
no
she
answered
quickly
it
would
only
bring
trouble
on
me
and
do
no
good
we
must
part
do
you
think
it
hurts
me
but
you
must
love
me
said
somerset
i
do
she
said
simply
and
that
is
why
it
hurts
now
i
must
be
going
back
ottilie
said
somerset
grasping
her
hands
need
you
ever
go
back
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
come
away
from
this
hateful
place
with
me
now
this
minute
you
need
never
see
bernheim
again
as
long
as
you
live
listen
my
friend
ross
has
a
i
can
manage
it
so
there
will
be
only
us
two
run
into
your
hotel
for
a
thick
cloak
and
meet
me
as
quickly
as
you
can
behind
the
if
we
go
full
speed
we
catch
the
at
dieppe
it
will
be
a
wild
race
for
our
life
happiness
come
in
his
excitement
he
rose
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
they
faced
each
other
for
a
few
glorious
moments
panting
for
breath
and
then
princess
ottilie
broke
down
and
cried
bitterly
i
ca
dear
i
ca
i
must
marry
bernheim
it
is
to
save
my
mother
from
something
dreadful
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
she
went
on
her
knees
to
me
and
i
promised
if
there
a
woman
in
europe
capable
of
getting
out
of
her
difficulties
unaided
it
is
the
princess
rabomirski
said
somerset
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
be
sold
you
are
mine
ottilie
and
by
heaven
i
going
to
have
you
come
he
urged
he
pleaded
he
put
his
strong
arms
around
her
as
if
he
would
carry
her
away
bodily
he
did
everything
that
a
frantic
young
man
could
do
but
the
more
the
little
princess
wept
the
more
inflexible
she
became
somerset
had
not
realized
before
this
steel
in
her
nature
raging
and
vehemently
urging
he
accompanied
her
back
to
the
casino
steps
would
you
like
to
say
to
me
morning
instead
of
she
asked
holding
out
her
hand
i
am
never
going
to
say
cried
somerset
i
shall
slip
out
morning
for
a
last
swim
at
six
she
said
unheeding
his
exclamation
our
train
goes
at
ten
then
she
came
very
close
to
him
vince
dear
if
you
love
me
do
make
me
more
unhappy
than
i
am
it
was
an
appeal
to
his
chivalry
he
kissed
her
hand
and
said
at
six
but
somerset
had
no
intention
of
bidding
her
a
final
farewell
in
the
morning
if
he
followed
her
the
world
over
he
would
snatch
her
out
of
the
arms
of
the
accursed
bernheim
and
marry
her
by
main
force
as
for
the
foreign
telegrams
of
daily
he
cared
not
how
they
would
be
he
went
to
bed
with
lofty
disregard
of
fleet
street
and
bread
and
butter
as
for
the
shame
from
which
ottilie
marriage
would
save
her
sainted
mother
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
she
was
selling
ottilie
to
bernheim
for
cash
down
he
stayed
awake
most
of
the
night
plotting
schemes
for
the
rescue
of
his
princess
it
would
be
an
excellent
plan
to
insult
bernheim
and
slay
him
outright
in
a
duel
its
disadvantages
lay
in
his
own
imperfections
as
a
duellist
and
for
the
first
time
he
cursed
the
benign
laws
of
his
country
at
length
he
fell
asleep
woke
up
to
find
it
daylight
and
leaped
to
his
feet
in
a
horrible
scare
but
a
sight
of
his
watch
reassured
him
it
was
only
five
at
he
put
on
a
set
of
bathing
things
and
sat
down
by
the
window
to
watch
the
hall
door
of
the
hotel
splendide
at
six
out
came
the
familiar
figure
of
the
little
princess
draped
in
her
white
she
glanced
up
at
somerset
window
he
waved
his
hand
and
in
a
minute
or
two
they
were
standing
side
by
side
at
the
water
edge
it
was
far
away
from
the
regular
marked
by
the
bathing
cabins
and
further
still
from
the
fishing
end
of
the
beach
where
alone
at
that
early
hour
were
signs
of
life
visible
the
town
behind
them
slept
in
warmth
and
light
the
sea
stretched
out
blue
before
them
unrippled
in
the
still
air
a
little
bank
of
purple
cloud
on
the
horizon
presaged
a
burning
day
the
little
princess
dropped
her
and
kicked
off
her
shoes
and
gave
her
hand
to
her
companion
he
glanced
at
the
little
white
feet
which
he
was
tempted
to
fall
down
and
kiss
and
then
at
the
wistful
face
below
the
foulard
knotted
in
front
over
the
his
heart
leaped
at
her
bewildering
sweetness
she
was
the
morning
incarnate
she
read
his
eyes
and
flushed
pink
let
us
go
in
she
said
they
waded
in
together
until
they
were
waist
deep
then
they
struck
out
making
for
the
open
sea
the
sting
of
the
night
had
already
passed
from
the
water
to
their
young
blood
it
felt
warm
they
swam
near
together
ottilie
using
a
steady
breast
stroke
and
somerset
a
side
stroke
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
flushed
and
glistening
face
from
the
blue
of
the
sea
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
to
the
light
blue
of
the
silk
foulard
the
blue
of
her
eyes
grew
magically
deep
there
seems
to
be
nothing
but
you
and
me
in
god
universe
ottilie
said
he
she
smiled
at
him
he
drew
quite
close
to
her
if
we
could
only
go
on
straight
until
we
found
an
enchanted
island
which
we
could
have
as
our
kingdom
the
sea
must
be
our
kingdom
said
ottilie
or
its
depths
shall
we
dive
down
and
look
for
the
of
amber
the
pavement
of
pearl
and
the
gold
throne
in
the
heart
of
the
sea
for
the
two
of
us
we
should
be
happier
than
in
the
world
replied
the
little
princess
they
swam
on
slowly
dreamily
in
silence
the
mild
waves
lapped
against
their
ears
and
their
mouths
the
morning
sun
lay
at
their
backs
and
its
radiance
fell
athwart
the
bay
through
the
stillness
came
the
faint
echo
of
a
fisherman
on
the
far
beach
hammering
at
his
boat
beyond
that
and
the
gentle
swirl
of
the
water
there
was
no
sound
after
a
while
they
altered
their
course
so
as
to
reach
a
small
boat
that
lay
at
anchor
for
the
convenience
of
the
stronger
swimmers
they
clambered
up
and
sat
on
the
gunwale
their
feet
dangling
in
the
sea
is
my
princess
tired
he
asked
she
laughed
in
merry
scorn
tired
why
i
could
swim
twenty
times
as
far
do
you
think
i
have
no
muscle
feel
do
you
know
i
fence
all
the
winter
she
braced
her
bare
arm
he
felt
the
muscle
then
relaxing
it
by
drawing
down
her
wrist
he
kissed
it
very
gently
soft
and
strong
like
yourself
said
he
ottilie
said
nothing
but
looked
at
her
white
feet
through
the
transparent
water
she
thought
that
in
letting
him
kiss
her
arm
and
feeling
as
though
he
had
kissed
right
through
to
her
heart
she
was
exhibiting
a
pitiful
lack
of
strength
somerset
looked
at
her
askance
uncertain
for
nothing
in
the
world
would
he
have
offended
did
you
mind
he
whispered
she
shook
her
head
and
continued
to
look
at
her
feet
somerset
felt
a
great
happiness
pulse
through
him
if
i
gave
you
up
said
he
i
should
be
the
poorest
spirited
dog
that
ever
whined
hush
she
said
putting
her
hand
in
his
let
us
think
only
of
the
present
happiness
they
sat
silent
for
a
moment
contemplating
the
little
town
and
which
nestled
in
greenery
beyond
the
white
sweep
of
the
beach
and
the
rococo
hotels
and
the
casino
whose
cupolas
flashed
gaudily
in
the
morning
sun
from
the
end
of
the
bay
stretched
a
long
line
of
sheer
white
cliff
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
towards
the
west
it
was
bounded
by
a
narrow
headland
running
far
out
to
sea
it
looks
like
a
frivolous
little
garden
of
eden
said
somerset
but
i
wish
we
could
never
set
foot
in
it
again
let
us
dive
in
and
forget
it
said
ottilie
she
slipped
into
the
water
somerset
stood
on
the
gunwale
and
dived
when
he
came
up
and
had
shaken
the
salt
water
from
his
nostrils
he
joined
her
in
two
or
three
strokes
let
us
go
round
the
point
to
the
little
beach
the
other
side
she
hesitated
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
swim
there
rest
and
swim
back
her
absence
might
be
noticed
but
she
felt
reckless
let
her
drink
this
hour
of
happiness
to
the
full
what
mattered
anything
that
could
follow
she
smiled
assent
and
they
struck
out
steadily
for
the
point
it
was
good
to
have
the
salt
smell
and
the
taste
of
the
brine
and
the
pleasant
smart
of
the
eyes
and
to
feel
their
mastery
of
the
sea
as
they
threw
out
their
flashing
white
arms
and
topped
each
tiny
wave
they
smiled
in
exultation
to
them
it
seemed
impossible
that
anyone
could
drown
for
the
buoyant
hour
they
were
creatures
of
the
element
now
and
then
a
gull
circled
before
them
looked
at
them
unconcerned
as
if
they
were
in
some
way
his
kindred
and
swept
off
into
the
distance
a
tired
white
butterfly
settled
for
a
moment
on
ottilie
head
then
fluttered
away
to
its
doom
they
swam
on
and
on
and
they
neared
the
point
they
slackened
for
a
moment
and
he
brought
his
face
close
to
hers
if
i
said
us
swim
on
for
ever
and
ever
would
you
do
it
yes
she
said
looking
deep
into
his
eyes
after
a
while
they
floated
restfully
the
last
question
and
answer
seemed
to
have
brought
them
a
great
peace
they
were
conscious
of
little
save
the
mystery
of
the
cloudless
ether
above
their
faces
and
the
infinite
sea
that
murmured
in
their
ears
strange
harmonies
of
love
and
death
harmonies
woven
from
the
human
yearnings
of
every
shore
and
the
hushed
secrets
of
eternal
time
so
close
were
they
bodily
together
that
now
and
then
hand
touched
hand
and
limb
brushed
limb
a
happy
stillness
of
the
soul
spread
its
wings
over
them
and
they
felt
it
to
be
a
consecration
of
their
love
presently
his
arm
sought
her
encircled
her
brought
her
head
on
his
shoulder
rest
a
little
he
whispered
she
closed
her
eyes
surrendered
her
innocent
self
to
the
flooding
rapture
of
the
moment
the
horrors
that
awaited
her
passed
from
her
brain
he
had
come
to
the
lonely
child
like
a
god
out
of
heaven
he
had
come
to
the
frightened
girl
like
a
new
terror
he
was
by
her
side
now
the
man
whom
of
all
men
god
had
made
to
accomplish
her
womanhood
and
to
take
all
of
soul
and
body
sense
and
brain
that
she
had
to
give
their
salt
lips
met
in
a
first
kiss
words
would
have
broken
the
spell
of
the
enchantment
cast
over
them
by
the
infinite
spaces
of
sea
and
sky
they
drifted
on
and
on
the
subtle
subconscious
movement
of
foot
and
hand
keeping
them
afloat
the
little
princess
moved
closer
to
him
so
as
to
feel
more
secure
around
her
the
circling
pressure
of
his
arm
he
laughed
a
man
short
exultant
laugh
and
gripped
her
more
tightly
never
had
he
felt
his
strength
more
sure
his
right
arm
and
his
legs
beat
rhythmically
and
he
felt
the
pulsation
of
the
measured
strokes
of
his
companion
feet
and
the
water
swirled
past
his
head
so
that
he
knew
they
were
making
way
most
swiftly
of
exertion
there
was
no
sense
whatever
he
met
her
eyes
fixed
through
lids
upon
his
face
her
soft
young
body
melted
into
his
he
lost
count
of
time
and
space
now
and
then
a
little
wave
broke
over
their
faces
and
they
laughed
and
cleared
the
brine
from
their
mouths
and
drew
more
close
together
if
it
was
for
that
she
whispered
once
i
could
go
to
sleep
soon
they
felt
the
gentle
rocking
of
the
sea
increase
and
waves
broke
more
often
over
them
somerset
was
the
first
to
note
the
change
loosening
his
hold
of
ottilie
he
trod
water
and
looked
around
to
his
amazement
they
were
still
abreast
of
the
point
but
far
out
to
sea
he
gazed
at
it
uncomprehendingly
for
an
instant
and
then
a
sudden
recollection
smote
him
like
a
message
of
death
they
had
caught
the
edge
of
the
current
against
which
swimmers
were
warned
and
the
current
held
them
in
its
grip
and
was
sweeping
them
on
while
they
floated
foolishly
a
swift
glance
at
ottilie
showed
him
that
she
too
realized
the
peril
with
the
outcoming
tide
it
was
almost
impossible
to
reach
the
shore
are
you
afraid
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
not
with
you
he
scanned
the
land
and
the
sea
on
the
arc
of
their
horizon
lay
the
black
hull
of
a
tramp
steamer
going
eastwards
far
away
to
the
west
was
a
speck
of
white
and
against
the
pale
sky
a
film
of
smoke
landwards
beyond
the
shimmering
water
stretched
the
sunny
bay
of
the
casino
its
gilt
cupolas
shot
tiny
flames
the
point
its
hither
side
deep
in
shadow
reached
out
helplessly
for
them
somerset
and
ottilie
still
paused
doing
nothing
more
than
keeping
themselves
afloat
and
they
felt
the
current
drifting
them
ever
seawards
it
looks
like
death
he
said
gravely
are
you
afraid
to
die
again
ottilie
said
not
with
you
he
looked
at
the
land
and
he
looked
at
the
white
speck
and
the
puff
of
smoke
then
suddenly
his
heart
leaped
with
the
thrilling
inspiration
of
a
wild
impossibility
let
us
leave
illerville
and
france
behind
us
death
is
as
certain
either
way
the
little
princess
looked
at
him
wonderingly
where
are
we
going
to
england
anywhere
but
illerville
she
said
he
struck
out
seawards
she
followed
each
saw
the
other
face
white
and
set
they
had
current
and
tide
with
them
they
swam
steadily
undistressed
after
a
silence
she
called
to
him
vince
if
we
go
to
our
kingdom
under
the
sea
you
will
take
me
down
in
your
arms
in
a
last
kiss
he
said
he
had
heard
as
who
has
not
of
love
being
stronger
than
death
now
he
knew
its
truth
but
he
swore
to
himself
a
great
oath
that
they
should
not
die
i
shall
take
my
princess
to
a
better
kingdom
he
said
later
presently
he
heard
her
breathing
painfully
she
could
not
hold
out
much
longer
i
will
carry
you
he
said
an
expert
swimmer
she
knew
the
way
to
hold
his
shoulders
and
leave
his
arms
unimpeded
the
contact
of
her
light
young
form
against
his
body
thrilled
him
and
redoubled
his
strength
he
held
his
head
for
a
second
high
out
of
the
water
and
turned
half
round
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
let
you
die
now
the
white
speck
had
grown
into
a
white
hull
and
somerset
was
making
across
its
track
to
do
so
he
must
deflect
slightly
from
the
line
of
the
current
his
great
battle
began
he
swam
doggedly
steadily
husbanding
his
strength
if
the
vessel
justified
his
first
flash
of
inspiration
and
if
he
could
reach
her
he
knew
how
he
should
act
as
best
he
could
for
it
was
no
time
for
speech
he
told
ottilie
his
hopes
he
felt
the
spray
from
her
lips
upon
his
cheek
as
she
said
it
seems
sinful
to
wish
for
greater
happiness
than
this
after
that
there
was
utter
silence
between
them
at
first
he
thought
exultingly
of
bernheim
and
the
princess
rabomirski
and
the
rage
of
their
wicked
hearts
of
the
future
glorified
by
his
little
princess
of
the
unconquerable
soul
of
the
present
mystic
consummation
of
their
marriage
but
gradually
mental
concepts
lost
sharpness
of
definition
sensation
began
to
merge
itself
into
a
of
stroke
on
stroke
through
the
illimitable
waste
despite
the
laughing
morning
sunshine
the
sky
became
dark
and
lowering
the
weight
on
his
neck
grew
heavier
at
first
ottilie
had
only
rested
her
arms
now
her
feet
were
as
lead
and
sank
behind
him
her
clasp
tightened
about
his
shoulders
he
struggled
on
through
a
welter
of
sea
and
mist
strange
sounds
sang
in
his
ears
as
if
over
them
had
been
clamped
great
at
each
short
breath
his
throat
gulped
down
bitter
water
a
horrible
pain
crept
across
his
chest
his
limbs
seemed
paralysed
and
yet
he
remained
above
the
surface
the
benumbed
brain
wondered
at
the
miracle
the
universe
broke
upon
his
vision
as
a
blurred
mass
of
green
and
white
he
recognised
it
vaguely
as
his
kingdom
beneath
the
sea
and
as
in
a
dream
he
remembered
his
promise
he
slipped
round
his
lips
met
ottilie
his
arms
wound
round
about
her
and
he
sank
holding
her
tightly
clasped
strange
things
happened
he
was
pulled
hither
and
thither
by
sea
monsters
welcoming
him
to
his
kingdom
in
a
confused
way
he
wondered
that
he
could
breathe
so
freely
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
unutterable
happiness
stole
upon
him
the
kingdom
was
his
sham
princess
would
be
queen
in
very
truth
but
where
was
she
he
opened
his
eyes
and
found
himself
lying
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
a
couple
of
men
were
doing
funny
things
to
his
arms
a
man
in
white
ducks
and
a
yachting
cap
stood
over
him
with
a
glass
of
brandy
when
he
had
drunk
the
spirit
the
rosy
man
laughed
that
was
a
narrow
shave
we
got
you
just
in
time
we
were
nearly
right
on
you
the
young
woman
is
doing
well
my
wife
is
looking
after
her
as
soon
as
he
could
collect
his
faculties
somerset
asked
are
you
the
yes
i
felt
sure
of
it
are
you
sir
henry
ransome
that
my
name
i
heard
you
were
expected
at
illerville
said
somerset
that
is
why
i
made
for
you
the
two
men
who
had
been
doing
queer
things
with
his
arms
wrapped
him
in
a
blanket
and
propped
him
up
against
the
deck
cabin
but
what
on
earth
were
you
two
young
people
doing
in
the
middle
of
the
english
channel
asked
the
owner
of
the
we
were
eloping
said
somerset
the
other
looked
at
him
for
a
bewildered
moment
and
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
he
turned
to
the
cabin
door
and
disappeared
to
emerge
a
moment
afterwards
followed
by
a
lady
in
a
morning
wrapper
what
do
you
think
marian
it
an
elopement
somerset
smiled
at
them
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
princess
rabomirski
you
have
well
this
is
her
daughter
perhaps
you
know
of
the
count
bernheim
who
is
always
about
with
the
princess
i
trod
on
him
last
winter
at
monte
carlo
said
sir
henry
ransome
he
survives
said
somerset
and
has
bought
the
princess
ottilie
from
her
mother
he
not
going
to
get
her
she
belongs
to
me
my
name
is
somerset
and
i
am
foreign
of
the
i
am
very
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
somerset
said
sir
henry
with
a
smile
and
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
if
you
can
lend
us
some
clothes
and
take
us
to
any
part
on
earth
save
you
will
earn
our
eternal
gratitude
sir
henry
looked
doubtful
we
have
made
our
arrangements
for
illerville
said
he
his
wife
broke
in
if
you
do
take
these
romantic
beings
straight
to
southampton
never
set
my
foot
upon
this
yacht
again
it
was
you
my
dear
who
were
crazy
to
come
to
illerville
do
you
think
said
lady
ransome
you
might
provide
somerset
with
some
dry
things
four
hours
afterwards
somerset
sat
on
deck
by
the
side
of
ottilie
who
warmly
wrapped
lay
on
a
long
chair
he
pointed
to
the
coastline
of
the
isle
of
wight
behold
our
kingdom
said
he
the
little
princess
laughed
that
is
not
our
kingdom
well
what
is
just
the
little
bit
of
space
that
contains
both
you
and
me
she
said
the
heart
at
twenty
the
girl
stood
at
the
end
of
the
little
stone
jetty
her
hair
and
the
ends
of
her
cheap
fur
boa
and
her
skirts
all
fluttering
behind
her
in
the
stiff
gale
why
anyone
should
choose
to
stand
on
a
jetty
on
a
raw
december
afternoon
with
the
wind
in
one
teeth
was
a
difficult
problem
for
a
elderly
man
like
myself
and
i
pondered
over
it
as
i
descended
the
slope
leading
from
the
village
to
the
sea
it
was
nothing
thought
i
but
youth
animal
delight
in
physical
things
a
few
steps
however
brought
me
in
view
of
her
face
in
and
i
saw
that
she
did
not
notice
wind
or
spray
but
was
staring
out
to
sea
with
an
intolerable
wistfulness
a
quick
turn
in
the
path
made
me
lose
the
profile
i
crossed
the
road
that
ran
along
the
shore
and
walked
rapidly
along
the
jetty
arriving
within
hailing
distance
i
called
her
pauline
she
pivoted
round
like
a
in
a
gust
and
with
a
sharp
cry
leaped
forward
to
meet
me
her
face
was
aflame
with
great
hope
and
joy
i
have
seen
to
my
gladness
that
expression
once
before
worn
by
a
woman
but
as
soon
as
this
one
recognised
me
the
joy
vanished
killed
outright
oh
it
you
she
said
with
a
quivering
lip
i
am
sorry
my
dear
said
i
taking
her
hand
i
ca
help
it
i
wish
from
my
heart
i
were
somebody
else
she
burst
into
tears
i
put
my
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
to
me
and
patted
her
and
said
there
there
in
the
blundering
masculine
way
having
helped
to
bring
her
into
the
world
twenty
years
before
i
could
claim
fatherly
privileges
oh
doctor
she
sobbed
dabbing
her
pretty
young
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
do
forgive
me
of
course
i
am
glad
to
see
you
it
was
the
shock
i
thought
you
were
a
ghost
no
one
ever
comes
to
ravetot
never
i
asked
mildly
the
tears
flowed
afresh
i
leaned
against
the
parapet
of
the
jetty
for
comfort
sake
and
looked
around
me
was
not
the
place
to
attract
visitors
in
december
a
shingle
beach
with
a
few
hauled
out
of
reach
of
the
surf
a
miniature
casino
like
an
impudently
large
and
desolate
a
desolate
and
hôtel
de
and
a
perky
deserted
villa
or
two
on
the
embankment
a
cliff
behind
them
topped
by
a
little
grey
church
the
road
that
led
up
the
gorge
losing
itself
in
the
turn
and
that
was
all
that
was
visible
of
a
projecting
cliff
bounded
the
bay
at
each
side
and
in
front
seethed
the
grey
angry
channel
it
was
an
aceldama
of
a
spot
in
winter
and
only
a
matter
of
peculiar
urgency
had
brought
me
hither
pauline
and
her
decrepit
rascal
of
a
father
were
tied
to
ravetot
by
sheer
poverty
he
owned
a
pretty
villa
half
a
mile
inland
and
the
rent
he
obtained
for
it
during
the
summer
enabled
them
to
live
in
some
miraculous
way
the
rest
of
the
year
they
the
curé
and
the
were
the
sole
winter
inhabitants
of
the
place
the
nearest
doctor
lived
at
merville
twenty
kilometres
away
and
there
was
not
even
an
educated
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
yet
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
my
little
friend
last
remark
was
somewhat
disingenuous
are
you
quite
sure
my
dear
i
said
that
no
one
ever
comes
to
ravetot
has
father
told
you
she
asked
tonelessly
no
i
guessed
it
i
have
extraordinary
powers
of
divination
and
the
somebody
has
been
making
my
little
girl
miserable
he
has
broken
my
heart
said
pauline
i
pulled
the
collar
of
my
coat
above
my
ears
which
the
wind
was
biting
being
elderly
and
i
am
sensitive
to
cold
i
proposed
that
we
should
walk
up
and
down
the
jetty
while
she
told
me
her
troubles
and
i
hooked
her
arm
in
mine
who
was
he
i
asked
and
what
was
he
doing
here
oh
doctor
what
does
it
matter
she
answered
tearfully
i
never
want
to
see
him
again
do
fib
said
i
if
the
confounded
blackguard
were
here
now
but
he
is
a
blackguard
she
flashed
if
he
were
i
should
be
so
miserable
i
should
forget
him
he
is
good
and
kind
and
noble
and
everything
that
is
right
i
could
have
expected
him
to
act
otherwise
it
was
awful
horrible
and
when
you
called
me
by
name
i
thought
it
was
he
and
the
contradictious
feminine
did
very
much
want
to
see
him
said
i
i
suppose
so
she
confessed
i
looked
down
at
her
pretty
face
and
saw
that
it
was
wan
and
pinched
you
have
been
eating
little
and
sleeping
less
for
how
long
i
demanded
sternly
for
a
week
she
said
pitifully
we
must
change
all
that
this
abominable
hole
is
a
kind
of
cold
storage
for
depression
she
drew
my
arm
tighter
she
had
always
been
an
affectionate
little
girl
and
now
she
seemed
to
crave
human
sympathy
and
companionship
i
do
mind
it
now
it
does
in
the
least
matter
where
i
am
before
he
came
i
used
to
hate
ravetot
and
long
for
the
gaiety
and
brightness
of
the
great
world
i
used
to
stand
here
for
hours
and
just
long
and
long
for
something
to
happen
to
take
us
away
and
it
seemed
no
good
here
i
was
for
the
rest
of
time
with
nothing
to
do
day
after
day
but
housework
and
sewing
and
reading
while
father
sat
by
the
fire
with
his
little
roulette
machine
and
monte
carlo
averages
and
paper
and
pencil
working
out
the
wonderful
system
that
is
going
to
make
our
fortune
we
never
have
enough
money
to
go
to
monte
carlo
for
him
to
try
it
so
that
is
some
comfort
one
would
have
thought
he
had
had
enough
of
gambling
she
made
the
allusion
very
simply
to
me
an
old
friend
her
father
had
gambled
away
a
fortune
and
in
desperation
had
forged
another
name
on
the
back
of
a
bill
for
which
he
had
suffered
a
term
of
imprisonment
his
relatives
had
cast
him
out
that
was
why
he
lived
in
seclusion
at
he
was
not
an
estimable
old
man
and
i
had
always
pitied
pauline
for
being
so
parented
her
mother
had
died
years
ago
i
thought
i
would
avoid
the
painful
topic
and
so
said
i
after
we
had
gone
the
length
of
the
jetty
in
silence
and
had
turned
again
one
day
when
the
lonely
little
princess
was
staring
out
to
sea
and
longing
for
she
knew
not
what
the
young
prince
out
of
the
fairy
tale
came
riding
up
behind
her
and
stayed
just
long
enough
to
make
her
lose
her
heart
and
then
rode
off
again
something
like
it
only
worse
she
murmured
and
then
with
a
sudden
break
in
her
voice
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
i
shall
go
mad
if
i
do
i
have
a
soul
in
the
world
to
speak
to
yes
he
came
he
found
me
standing
at
the
end
of
the
jetty
he
asked
his
way
in
french
to
the
cemetery
and
i
recognised
from
his
accent
that
he
was
english
like
myself
i
asked
him
why
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
cemetery
he
said
that
it
was
to
see
his
wife
grave
the
only
englishwoman
buried
here
was
a
everest
who
was
drowned
last
summer
this
was
the
husband
he
explained
that
he
was
in
the
indian
civil
service
was
now
on
leave
being
in
paris
he
thought
he
would
like
to
come
to
ravetot
where
he
could
have
quiet
in
order
to
write
a
book
i
understood
it
was
to
see
his
wife
grave
i
remarked
he
wanted
to
do
that
as
well
you
see
they
had
been
separated
for
some
years
judicially
separated
she
was
not
a
nice
woman
he
tell
me
so
he
was
too
chivalrous
a
gentleman
but
i
had
learned
about
her
from
the
gossip
of
the
place
i
walked
with
him
to
the
cemetery
i
know
a
girl
would
have
gone
off
like
that
with
a
stranger
my
dear
said
i
in
she
would
have
gone
off
with
a
hippogriffin
she
pressed
my
arm
how
understanding
you
are
doctor
dear
i
have
an
inkling
of
the
laws
that
govern
humanity
i
replied
well
and
after
the
pleasant
trip
to
the
cemetery
he
asked
me
whether
the
café
at
the
top
of
the
hill
was
really
the
only
place
to
stay
at
in
ravetot
it
dreadful
you
know
no
one
goes
there
but
fishermen
and
farm
labourers
and
it
is
the
only
place
the
hotel
is
shut
up
out
of
the
season
i
said
that
ravetot
encourage
visitors
during
the
winter
he
looked
disappointed
and
said
that
he
would
have
to
find
quiet
somewhere
else
then
he
asked
whether
there
was
any
house
that
would
take
him
in
as
a
boarder
she
paused
well
i
enquired
oh
doctor
he
seemed
so
strong
and
kind
and
his
eyes
were
so
frank
i
knew
he
was
everything
that
a
man
ought
to
be
we
were
friends
at
once
and
i
hated
the
thought
of
losing
him
it
is
not
gay
at
ravetot
with
only
jeanne
to
talk
to
from
week
end
to
week
end
and
then
we
are
so
poor
and
you
know
we
do
take
in
paying
guests
when
we
can
get
them
i
understand
perfectly
said
i
she
nodded
that
was
how
it
happened
would
a
nice
girl
have
done
such
a
thing
i
replied
that
if
she
knew
as
much
of
the
ways
of
nice
girls
as
i
did
she
would
be
astounded
she
smiled
wanly
and
went
on
with
her
artless
story
of
course
everest
jumped
at
the
suggestion
it
is
not
given
to
every
young
and
unlamenting
widower
to
be
housed
beneath
the
same
roof
with
so
delicious
a
young
woman
as
pauline
he
brought
his
luggage
and
took
possession
of
the
best
spare
room
in
the
villa
while
pauline
and
old
slatternly
jeanne
the
à
tout
went
about
with
agitated
minds
and
busy
hands
attending
to
his
comfort
old
widdrington
however
in
his
morose
did
not
welcome
the
visitor
he
growled
and
grumbled
and
rated
his
daughter
for
not
having
doubled
the
terms
did
she
know
they
wanted
every
penny
they
could
get
something
was
wrong
with
his
roulette
machine
which
ought
to
be
sent
to
paris
for
repairs
where
was
the
money
to
come
from
pauline
father
is
the
most
unscrupulous
selfish
old
curmudgeon
of
my
acquaintance
then
according
to
my
young
lady
incoherent
and
parenthetic
narrative
followed
idyllic
days
pauline
chattered
to
everest
in
the
morning
walked
with
him
in
the
afternoon
pretended
to
play
the
piano
to
him
in
the
evening
and
in
between
times
sat
with
him
at
meals
the
inevitable
happened
she
had
met
no
one
like
him
before
he
represented
the
strength
and
the
music
of
the
great
world
he
flashed
upon
her
as
the
realisation
of
the
vague
visions
that
had
floated
before
her
eyes
when
she
stared
seawards
in
the
driving
wind
that
the
man
was
a
bit
in
love
with
her
seems
certain
i
think
that
one
day
when
a
wayside
shed
was
sheltering
them
from
the
rain
he
must
have
kissed
her
a
young
girl
confidences
are
full
of
details
but
the
important
ones
are
generally
left
out
they
can
be
divined
however
by
the
old
and
experienced
at
any
rate
pauline
was
radiantly
happy
and
everest
appeared
contented
to
stay
indefinitely
at
ravetot
and
watch
her
happiness
thus
far
the
story
was
ordinary
enough
given
the
circumstances
it
would
have
been
extraordinary
if
my
poor
little
pauline
had
not
fallen
in
love
with
the
man
and
if
the
man
heart
had
not
been
touched
if
he
had
found
the
girl
feelings
too
deep
for
his
response
and
had
precipitately
bolted
from
a
confused
sense
of
acting
honourably
towards
her
the
story
would
also
have
been
commonplace
the
cause
of
his
sudden
riding
away
was
peculiarly
painful
somehow
i
can
not
blame
him
and
yet
i
am
vain
enough
to
imagine
that
i
should
have
acted
otherwise
one
morning
everest
asked
her
if
jeanne
might
search
his
bedroom
for
a
piece
which
he
must
have
dropped
on
the
floor
in
the
afternoon
her
father
gave
her
twenty
francs
to
get
a
postal
order
he
was
sending
to
paris
for
some
fresh
mechanism
for
his
precious
everest
accompanied
her
to
the
little
post
office
they
walked
arm
in
arm
through
the
village
like
an
affianced
couple
and
i
fancy
he
must
have
said
tenderer
things
than
usual
on
the
way
for
at
this
stage
of
the
story
she
wept
when
she
laid
the
louis
on
the
stab
below
the
she
noticed
that
it
was
a
a
new
spanish
coin
spanish
gold
is
rare
she
showed
it
to
everest
and
meeting
his
eyes
read
in
them
a
curious
questioning
the
money
order
obtained
they
continued
their
walk
happily
and
pauline
forgot
the
incident
some
days
passed
everest
grew
troubled
and
preoccupied
one
day
he
avoided
her
society
altogether
she
lived
through
it
in
a
distressed
wonder
and
cried
herself
to
sleep
that
night
how
had
she
offended
the
next
morning
he
gravely
announced
his
departure
urgent
affairs
summoned
him
to
paris
in
dazed
misery
she
accepted
the
payment
of
his
account
and
wrote
him
a
receipt
his
face
was
set
like
a
mask
and
he
looked
at
her
out
of
cold
stern
eyes
which
frightened
her
in
a
timid
way
she
asked
him
if
he
were
going
without
one
kind
word
there
are
times
miss
widdrington
said
he
when
no
word
at
all
is
the
kindest
but
what
have
i
done
she
cried
nothing
at
all
but
what
is
good
and
right
you
may
think
whatever
you
like
of
me
he
grasped
his
gladstone
bag
and
through
the
window
she
saw
him
give
it
to
the
who
was
to
carry
it
three
miles
to
the
nearest
wayside
station
he
disappeared
through
the
gate
and
so
out
of
her
life
fat
slatternly
jeanne
came
upon
her
a
few
moments
later
moaning
her
heart
out
and
administered
comfort
it
is
very
hard
for
mademoiselle
but
what
could
mademoiselle
expect
monsieur
everest
could
not
stay
any
longer
in
the
house
naturally
of
course
monsieur
was
a
little
touched
in
the
brain
with
his
eternal
calculations
he
was
not
responsible
for
his
actions
still
monsieur
everest
did
not
like
monsieur
to
take
money
out
of
his
room
but
great
god
of
pity
did
not
mademoiselle
know
that
was
the
reason
of
monsieur
everest
going
away
it
was
father
who
had
stolen
the
spanish
louis
cried
pauline
in
a
passion
of
tears
as
we
leaned
once
more
against
the
parapet
of
the
jetty
he
also
stole
a
note
then
he
was
caught
by
everest
rifling
his
jeanne
overheard
them
talking
it
is
horrible
horrible
how
he
must
despise
me
i
feel
wrapped
in
flames
when
i
think
of
it
and
i
love
him
so
and
i
have
slept
for
a
week
and
my
heart
is
broken
i
could
do
little
to
soothe
this
paroxysm
save
let
it
spend
itself
against
my
while
i
again
put
my
arm
around
her
the
grey
tide
was
leaping
in
and
the
fine
spray
dashed
in
my
face
the
early
twilight
began
to
settle
over
ravetot
which
appeared
more
desolate
than
ever
never
mind
my
dear
said
i
you
are
young
and
as
your
soul
is
sweet
and
clean
you
will
get
over
this
never
she
moaned
you
will
leave
and
all
its
associations
and
the
brightness
of
life
will
drive
all
the
shadows
away
no
it
is
impossible
my
heart
is
broken
and
i
only
want
to
stay
here
at
the
end
of
the
jetty
until
i
die
i
shall
die
anyhow
i
remarked
with
a
shiver
if
i
stay
here
much
longer
and
i
do
want
to
let
us
go
home
she
assented
we
walked
away
from
the
sea
and
struck
the
gloomy
inland
road
then
i
said
somewhat
meaningly
have
you
the
curiosity
to
enquire
why
i
left
my
comfortable
house
in
london
to
come
to
this
hole
why
did
you
doctor
dear
she
asked
listlessly
to
inform
you
that
your
cross
old
aunt
caroline
is
dead
that
she
has
left
you
three
thousand
pounds
a
year
under
my
trusteeship
till
you
are
and
that
i
am
going
to
carry
off
the
rich
and
beautiful
miss
pauline
widdrington
to
england
she
stood
looking
at
me
is
it
true
she
gasped
of
course
said
i
her
face
was
transfigured
with
a
sudden
radiance
amazement
rapture
youth
the
pulsating
wonder
of
her
twenty
years
danced
in
her
eyes
in
her
excitement
she
pulled
me
by
the
lapels
of
my
coat
doctor
three
thousand
pounds
a
year
england
london
men
and
women
everything
i
longed
for
all
the
glad
and
beautiful
things
of
life
yes
my
dear
she
took
my
hands
and
swung
them
backwards
and
forwards
it
heaven
delicious
heaven
she
cried
but
what
about
the
broken
heart
i
said
maliciously
she
dropped
my
hands
sighed
and
her
face
suddenly
assumed
an
expression
of
portentous
misery
i
was
forgetting
what
does
anything
matter
now
i
shall
never
get
over
it
my
heart
broken
devil
a
bit
my
dear
said
i
the
scourge
i
up
to
the
death
of
his
wife
that
is
to
say
for
years
sir
hildebrand
oates
held
himself
to
be
a
very
important
and
upright
man
whose
life
not
only
was
unassailable
by
slander
but
even
through
the
divine
ordering
of
his
being
exempt
from
criticism
to
the
world
and
to
himself
he
represented
the
incarnation
of
british
impeccability
faultless
from
the
little
pink
crown
of
his
head
to
the
tips
of
his
toes
correctly
pedicured
and
unstained
by
purples
of
retributive
gout
except
in
church
where
a
conventional
humility
of
attitude
is
imposed
his
mind
was
blandly
no
ghost
of
sins
committed
disturbed
his
slumbers
he
had
committed
no
sin
he
could
tick
off
the
ten
commandments
one
by
one
with
a
serene
conscience
he
objected
to
profane
swearing
he
was
a
strict
sabbatarian
he
had
honoured
his
father
and
his
mother
and
had
erected
a
monument
over
their
grave
which
added
another
fear
of
death
to
the
beholder
he
neither
thieved
nor
murdered
nor
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
don
juan
nor
in
those
of
his
own
infamous
namesake
and
being
blessed
in
the
world
goods
coveted
nothing
possessed
by
his
neighbour
not
even
his
wife
for
his
neighbours
wives
could
not
compare
in
wifely
meekness
with
his
own
in
thought
too
he
had
not
sinned
never
so
far
as
he
remembered
had
he
spoken
a
ribald
word
never
indeed
had
he
laughed
at
an
unsavoury
jest
it
may
be
questioned
whether
he
had
laughed
at
any
kind
of
joke
whatsoever
sir
hildebrand
stood
for
many
things
for
public
morality
his
name
appeared
on
the
committees
of
all
the
societies
for
the
suppression
of
all
the
vices
for
sound
liberalism
and
incorruptible
government
he
had
poured
much
of
his
fortune
into
the
party
coffers
and
to
his
astonishment
a
gracious
and
sovereign
had
conveyed
recognition
of
his
virtues
in
the
form
of
a
knighthood
for
the
sacred
rights
of
the
people
as
justice
of
the
peace
he
sentenced
vagrants
who
slept
in
other
people
barns
to
the
severest
penalties
for
principle
in
private
life
in
spite
of
the
rending
of
his
own
heart
and
the
agonized
tears
of
his
wife
he
had
cast
off
his
undutiful
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
who
had
been
guilty
of
the
sin
of
disobedience
and
had
run
away
taking
their
creaking
destinies
in
their
own
hands
for
the
sanctity
of
home
life
night
and
morning
he
read
prayers
before
the
assembled
household
and
dismissed
any
maidservant
who
committed
the
impropriety
of
conversing
with
a
villager
of
the
opposite
sex
from
youth
up
his
demeanour
had
been
studiously
grave
and
punctiliously
courteous
a
man
of
birth
and
breeding
he
made
it
his
ambition
to
be
what
he
with
narrow
definition
termed
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
but
being
of
whig
lineage
he
had
sat
in
parliament
as
an
hereditary
liberal
and
believed
in
progressive
institutions
it
is
difficult
to
give
a
flashlight
picture
of
a
human
being
at
once
so
simple
and
so
complex
an
ardent
pharisee
may
serve
as
an
epigrammatic
characterisation
hypocrite
he
was
not
no
miserable
sinner
more
convinced
of
his
rectitude
more
devoid
of
pretence
ever
walked
the
earth
though
his
narrowness
of
view
earned
him
but
little
love
from
his
his
singleness
of
purpose
aided
by
an
ample
fortune
gained
a
measure
of
their
respect
he
lived
irreproachably
up
to
his
standards
in
an
age
of
general
scepticism
he
had
unshakable
faith
he
believed
intensely
in
himself
now
this
passionate
certitude
of
infallibility
found
as
far
as
his
life
drama
is
concerned
its
supreme
expression
in
his
relation
to
his
wife
his
children
and
his
money
he
married
young
his
wife
brought
him
a
fortune
for
which
he
was
sole
trustee
a
couple
of
children
and
a
submissive
obedience
unparalleled
in
the
most
correct
of
moslem
households
eresby
manor
where
they
had
lived
for
thirty
years
was
her
own
individual
property
and
she
drew
for
pocket
money
some
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
a
timid
weak
sentimental
soul
she
was
daunted
from
the
first
few
frosty
days
of
honeymoon
by
the
inflexible
personality
of
her
husband
for
thirty
years
she
passed
in
the
world
eye
for
little
else
than
his
shadow
my
dear
you
must
allow
me
to
judge
in
such
matters
he
would
say
in
reply
to
mild
remonstrance
and
she
deferred
invariably
to
his
judgment
when
his
son
godfrey
and
his
daughter
sybil
went
their
respective
unfilial
ways
it
was
enough
for
him
to
remark
with
cold
eyes
and
slight
expressive
gesture
my
dear
distressing
as
i
know
it
is
to
you
their
conduct
has
broken
my
heart
and
i
forbid
the
mention
of
their
names
in
this
house
and
the
years
passed
and
the
perfect
wife
though
in
secret
she
may
have
mourned
like
rachel
for
her
children
obeyed
the
very
letter
of
her
husband
law
there
remains
the
third
vital
point
to
which
i
must
refer
if
i
am
to
make
comprehensible
the
strange
story
of
sir
hildebrand
oates
it
was
money
or
more
explicitly
the
diabolical
caprice
of
finance
that
first
shook
sir
hildebrand
faith
not
perhaps
in
his
own
infallibility
but
in
the
harmonious
of
divine
providence
and
himself
for
the
four
or
five
years
preceding
his
wife
death
his
unerring
instinct
in
financial
affairs
failed
him
speculations
that
promised
indubitably
the
golden
fruit
of
the
hesperides
produced
nothing
but
dead
sea
apples
he
lost
enormous
sums
of
money
irritability
constricted
both
his
brow
and
the
old
debonair
s
at
the
end
of
his
signature
and
when
the
county
guarantee
investment
society
of
which
he
was
one
of
the
original
founders
and
directors
called
up
unpaid
balance
on
shares
and
even
then
hovered
on
the
verge
of
scandalous
liquidation
sir
hildebrand
found
himself
racked
with
indignant
anxiety
he
was
sitting
at
a
table
in
his
library
a
decorous
library
a
gentleman
library
lined
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
bookcases
filled
with
books
that
no
gentleman
library
should
be
without
and
trying
to
solve
the
eternal
problem
why
two
and
two
should
not
make
forty
when
the
butler
entered
announcing
the
doctor
ah
thompson
glad
to
see
you
what
is
it
have
you
looked
at
lady
oates
been
a
bit
queer
for
some
days
these
east
winds
i
hold
them
responsible
for
half
the
sickness
of
the
county
he
threw
up
an
accusing
hand
if
the
east
wind
had
been
a
human
vagabond
brought
before
sir
hildebrand
oates
justice
of
the
peace
it
would
have
whined
itself
into
a
zephyr
sir
hildebrand
eyes
looked
blue
and
cold
at
offenders
from
a
stature
of
medium
height
he
managed
to
extract
the
dignity
of
beneath
a
very
long
and
very
straight
nose
a
grizzling
moustache
dependent
on
the
muscles
of
the
thin
lips
as
to
whether
it
should
go
up
or
down
symbolised
as
it
were
the
scales
of
justice
sketches
of
accurately
trimmed
grey
whiskers
also
indicated
the
exact
balance
of
his
mind
but
to
show
that
he
was
human
and
not
impassionately
divine
his
thin
hair
once
black
now
greenish
was
parted
low
down
on
the
left
side
and
brought
straight
over
leaving
the
little
pink
crown
to
which
i
have
before
alluded
his
complexion
was
florid
disavowing
atrabiliar
prejudice
he
had
the
long
blunted
chin
of
those
secure
of
their
destiny
he
was
extraordinarily
clean
the
doctor
said
abruptly
it
nothing
to
do
with
east
winds
internal
complications
i
have
to
tell
you
she
very
seriously
a
shadow
of
impatience
passed
over
sir
hildebrand
brow
just
like
my
wife
said
he
to
fall
ill
when
i
already
half
off
my
head
with
worry
the
county
guarantee
sir
hildebrand
nodded
the
misfortunes
of
the
society
were
public
property
and
public
too
within
the
fairly
wide
area
of
his
acquaintance
was
the
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
sir
hildebrand
was
heavily
involved
therein
too
often
had
he
vaunted
the
beneficent
prosperity
of
the
concern
to
which
he
had
given
his
august
support
at
his
own
men
had
dreaded
the
after
the
departure
of
the
ladies
and
at
his
club
men
had
fled
from
him
as
they
flee
from
the
baconian
mythologist
it
is
a
worry
the
doctor
admitted
but
financial
preoccupations
must
give
way
he
looked
sir
hildebrand
clear
in
the
eyes
must
give
way
before
elementary
questions
of
life
and
death
death
sir
hildebrand
regarded
him
blankly
how
dare
death
intrude
in
so
unmannerly
a
fashion
across
his
threshold
i
should
have
been
called
in
weeks
ago
said
the
doctor
all
i
can
suggest
now
is
that
you
should
get
sir
almeric
home
down
from
london
i
telephone
at
once
with
your
authority
an
operation
may
save
her
by
all
means
but
tell
me
i
had
no
idea
i
wanted
to
send
for
you
last
week
but
she
so
obstinate
said
it
was
mere
indigestion
you
should
have
sent
for
me
all
the
same
anyhow
said
sir
hildebrand
tell
me
the
worst
the
doctor
told
him
and
departed
sir
hildebrand
walked
up
and
down
his
library
a
man
undeservedly
stricken
the
butler
entered
pringle
the
chauffeur
desired
audience
admitted
the
man
plunged
into
woeful
apology
he
had
been
trying
the
mercédès
on
its
return
from
an
overhaul
and
as
he
turned
the
corner
by
rushworth
farm
a
motor
lorry
had
run
into
him
and
smashed
his
i
told
you
when
i
engaged
you
said
sir
hildebrand
that
i
allowed
no
accidents
it
only
the
lamps
i
was
driving
most
careful
the
driver
of
the
lorry
owns
himself
in
the
wrong
pleaded
the
chauffeur
the
merits
or
demerits
of
the
case
replied
sir
hildebrand
do
not
interest
me
it
an
accident
i
do
allow
accidents
you
take
a
month
notice
very
well
sir
hildebrand
but
i
do
think
it
enough
said
sir
hildebrand
dismissing
him
i
have
nothing
more
to
hear
from
you
or
to
say
to
you
then
when
he
was
alone
again
sir
hildebrand
reflected
that
noble
resignation
under
misfortune
was
the
part
of
a
christian
gentleman
and
in
chastened
mood
went
upstairs
to
see
his
wife
and
in
the
days
that
followed
when
sir
almeric
home
summoned
too
late
had
performed
the
useless
wonders
of
his
magical
craft
and
had
gone
sir
hildebrand
most
impeccable
of
husbands
visited
the
twice
a
day
making
the
most
correct
enquiries
beseeching
her
to
name
desires
capable
of
fulfilment
and
urbanely
prophesying
speedy
return
to
health
at
the
end
of
the
second
visit
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
the
ukase
went
forth
to
the
servants
hall
that
no
one
should
speak
above
a
whisper
for
fear
of
disturbing
her
ladyship
and
the
gardeners
had
orders
to
supply
the
with
a
daily
profusion
of
flowers
mortal
gentleman
could
show
no
greater
solicitude
for
a
sick
wife
save
perhaps
bring
her
a
bunch
of
violets
in
his
own
hand
but
with
an
automatic
supply
of
orchids
why
should
he
think
of
so
trumpery
an
offering
lady
oates
died
sir
hildebrand
accepted
the
stroke
with
christian
resignation
the
lord
giveth
and
the
lord
taketh
away
yet
his
house
was
desolate
he
appreciated
her
virtues
which
were
many
he
went
categorically
through
her
attributes
a
faithful
wife
a
worthy
mother
of
unworthy
children
a
capable
manager
a
submissive
helpmate
a
country
gentlewoman
of
the
old
school
who
provided
supremely
for
her
husband
material
comforts
and
never
trespassed
into
the
sphere
of
his
intellectual
and
other
masculine
activities
his
grief
at
the
loss
of
his
eliza
was
sincere
the
impending
crash
of
the
county
guarantee
investment
society
ceased
to
trouble
him
his
own
fortune
had
practically
gone
let
it
go
his
dead
wife
remained
sufficient
to
maintain
his
position
in
the
county
as
thompson
had
rightly
said
the
vulgarities
of
finance
must
give
way
to
the
eternal
sublimities
of
death
his
wife
with
whom
he
had
lived
for
thirty
years
in
a
conjugal
felicity
unclouded
save
by
the
unforgivable
sins
of
his
children
now
exiled
through
their
own
wilfulness
to
remote
parts
of
the
empire
was
dead
the
stupendous
fact
eclipsed
all
other
facts
in
a
universe
lady
oates
who
after
the
way
of
women
of
limited
outlook
had
always
taken
a
great
interest
in
funerals
had
the
funeral
of
her
life
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
conducted
the
funeral
service
the
county
headed
by
the
old
duke
of
dunster
his
neighbour
followed
her
to
the
grave
ii
she
was
a
good
christian
woman
haversham
said
sir
hildebrand
later
in
the
day
i
did
not
deserve
her
but
i
think
i
may
feel
that
i
did
my
best
all
my
life
to
ensure
her
happiness
no
doubt
of
course
replied
haversham
the
county
lawyer
er
do
you
think
we
might
get
this
formal
business
over
brought
lady
oates
will
in
my
pocket
he
drew
out
a
sealed
envelope
sir
hildebrand
held
out
his
hand
the
lawyer
shook
his
head
i
executor
it
written
on
the
outside
i
must
open
it
you
executor
that
rather
strange
said
sir
hildebrand
haversham
opened
the
envelope
adjusted
his
glasses
and
glanced
through
the
document
then
he
took
off
his
glasses
and
his
brows
wrinkled
and
with
a
queer
look
half
scared
half
malicious
in
his
eyes
gazed
at
sir
hildebrand
i
must
tell
you
my
dear
oates
said
he
after
a
moment
or
so
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
making
of
this
nothing
whatsoever
lady
oates
called
at
my
office
about
two
years
ago
and
placed
the
sealed
envelope
in
my
charge
i
had
no
idea
of
the
contents
till
this
minute
let
me
see
said
sir
hildebrand
and
again
he
stretched
out
his
hand
haversham
holding
the
paper
hesitated
for
a
few
seconds
i
afraid
i
must
read
it
to
you
there
being
no
third
party
present
third
party
what
do
you
mean
a
witness
a
formal
precaution
the
lawyer
again
put
on
his
glasses
the
introductory
matter
is
the
ordinary
phraseology
of
the
printed
form
one
buys
at
stationers
shops
naming
me
executor
then
he
read
aloud
i
will
and
bequeath
to
my
husband
sir
hildebrand
oates
knight
the
sum
of
fifteen
shillings
to
buy
himself
a
scourge
to
do
penance
for
the
arrogance
uncharitableness
and
cruelty
with
which
he
has
treated
myself
and
my
beloved
children
for
the
last
thirty
years
i
bequeath
to
my
son
godfrey
the
house
and
estate
of
eresby
manor
and
all
the
furniture
plate
jewels
livestock
and
everything
of
mine
comprised
therein
the
residue
of
my
possessions
i
bequeath
to
my
son
godfrey
and
my
daughter
sybil
in
equal
shares
i
leave
it
to
my
children
to
act
generously
by
my
old
servants
and
my
horses
and
dogs
sir
hildebrand
florid
face
grew
purple
he
looked
and
at
the
lawyer
and
gurgled
horribly
in
his
throat
haversham
hastily
rang
a
bell
the
butler
appeared
between
them
they
carried
sir
hildebrand
up
to
bed
and
sent
for
the
doctor
iii
when
sir
hildebrand
recovered
which
he
did
quickly
he
went
about
like
a
man
in
a
daze
stupified
by
his
wife
hideous
accusation
and
monstrous
ingratitude
it
was
inconceivable
that
the
submissive
angel
with
whom
he
had
lived
and
the
secret
writer
of
those
appalling
words
should
be
one
and
the
same
person
surely
insanity
that
invalidated
the
will
but
haversham
pointed
out
that
insanity
would
have
to
be
proved
which
was
impossible
the
will
contained
no
legal
flaw
lady
oates
dispositions
would
have
to
be
carried
out
it
leaves
me
practically
a
pauper
said
sir
hildebrand
whereat
the
other
imperceptibly
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
realised
in
cold
terror
that
the
house
wherein

the
chairs
and
tables
belonged
to
his
son
godfrey
his
own
personal
belongings
could
be
carried
away
in
a
couple
of
handcarts
instead
of
thousands
his
income
had
suddenly
dwindled
to
a
salvage
of
a
few
hundreds
a
year
from
his
position
in
the
county
he
had
tumbled
with
the
suddenness
and
irreparability
of
all
the
vanities
of
his
life
sprang
on
him
and
choked
him
he
was
a
person
of
no
importance
whatever
he
gasped
had
mere
outside
misfortune
beset
him
he
doubtless
would
have
faced
his
downfall
with
the
courage
of
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
his
soul
would
have
been
untouched
but
now
it
was
stabbed
and
with
an
envenomed
blade
his
wife
had
brought
him
to
bitter
shame
arrogance
uncharitableness
cruelty
the
denunciation
rang
in
his
head
day
and
night
he
arrogant
uncharitable
cruel
the
charge
staggered
reason
his
indignant
glance
sweeping
backward
through
the
years
could
see
nothing
in
his
life
but
continuous
humility
charity
and
kindness
he
had
not
deviated
a
hair
breath
from
irreproachable
standards
of
conduct
arrogant
when
sybil
engaged
in
consequences
of
his
tender
sagacity
to
a
neighbouring
magnate
a
widowed
ironmaster
eloped
at
dead
of
night
on
her
wedding
eve
with
a
penniless
subaltern
in
the
indian
army
he
suffered
humiliation
before
the
countryside
with
manly
dignity
no
less
humiliating
had
been
his
position
and
no
less
resigned
his
attitude
when
godfrey
declining
to
obey
the
rules
of
the
house
declining
also
to
be
ordained
and
take
up
the
living
of
thereon
in
the
gift
of
the
lady
of
the
manor
of
eresby
went
off
in
undutiful
passion
to
canada
to
pursue
some
godless
and
precarious
career
uncharitableness
cruelty
his
children
had
defied
him
and
with
callous
barbarity
had
cut
all
filial
ties
and
his
wife
she
had
lived
in
all
her
days
it
was
she
who
had
been
cruel
inconceivably
malignant
iv
sir
hildebrand
after
giving
haversham
the
lawyer
an
account
of
his
stewardship
in
his
wild
investments
he
had
not
imperilled
a
penny
of
his
wife
money
resigned
his
county
appointments
chairmanships
and
presidentships
and
memberships
of
committees
went
to
london
and
took
a
room
at
his
club
rumour
of
his
fallen
fortunes
spread
quickly
he
found
himself
neither
shunned
nor
snubbed
but
not
welcomed
in
the
inner
coterie
before
which
as
a
wealthy
and
important
county
gentleman
he
had
been
wont
to
lay
down
the
law
no
longer
was
he
sir
oracle
sensitive
to
the
subtle
changes
he
attributed
them
to
the
rank
snobbery
of
his
no
doubt
he
was
right
the
delicate
point
of
snobbery
that
he
did
not
realise
was
the
difference
between
the
degrees
of
sufferance
accorded
to
the
rich
bore
and
the
poor
bore
in
the
eyes
of
the
club
sir
hildebrand
oates
was
the
poor
bore
he
became
freezingly
aware
of
a
devastating
loneliness
in
the
meanwhile
his
children
had
written
the
correctest
of
letters
deep
grief
for
mother
death
was
the
keynote
of
each
with
regard
to
worldly
matters
sybil
confessed
that
the
legacy
made
a
revolution
in
her
plans
for
her
children
future
but
would
not
affect
her
present
movements
as
she
could
not
allow
her
husband
to
abandon
a
career
which
promised
to
be
brilliant
she
would
be
home
in
a
couple
of
years
the
son
godfrey
welcomed
the
unexpected
fortune
the
small
business
he
had
got
together
just
needed
this
capital
to
expand
into
gigantic
proportions
it
would
be
two
or
three
years
before
he
could
leave
it
in
the
meantime
he
hoped
his
father
would
not
dream
of
leaving
eresby
manor
neither
son
nor
daughter
seemed
to
be
aware
of
sir
impoverishment
also
neither
of
them
expressed
sympathy
for
or
even
alluded
to
the
grief
that
he
himself
must
be
suffering
the
omission
puzzled
him
for
he
had
the
lawyer
assurance
that
they
should
remain
ignorant
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
of
the
dreadful
text
of
the
will
did
the
omission
arise
from
doubt
in
their
minds
as
to
his
love
for
their
mother
and
the
genuineness
of
his
sorrow
at
her
death
to
solve
the
riddle
sir
hildebrand
began
to
think
as
he
had
never
thought
before
v
arrogance
uncharitableness
and
cruelty
to
wife
and
children
for
thirty
years
fifteen
shillings
to
buy
a
scourge
wherewith
to
do
penance
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
by
day
or
night
the
earth
beneath
his
feet
which
he
had
deemed
so
solid
became
a
quagmire
so
that
he
knew
not
where
to
step
and
the
serene
air
darkened
the
roots
of
his
being
suffered
cataclysm
either
his
wife
had
been
some
mad
monster
in
human
form
or
her
terrible
indictment
had
some
basis
of
truth
the
man
soul
writhed
in
the
flame
of
the
blazing
words
a
scourge
for
penance
fifteen
shillings
to
buy
it
with
in
due
course
he
received
the
ghastly
cheque
from
haversham
his
first
impulse
was
to
tear
it
to
pieces
his
second
to
fold
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
at
the
end
of
a
business
meeting
with
haversham
a
day
or
two
later
he
asked
him
why
did
you
insult
me
by
sending
me
the
cheque
for
fifteen
shillings
it
was
a
legal
formality
with
which
i
was
bound
to
comply
minimis
non
curet
said
sir
hildebrand
no
one
pays
rent
or
farthing
damages
or
the
shilling
consideration
in
a
contract
your
action
implies
malicious
agreement
with
lady
opinion
of
me
he
bent
his
head
forward
and
looked
at
haversham
with
feverish
intensity
haversham
had
old
scores
to
settle
the
importance
omniscience
perfection
and
condescending
urbanity
of
sir
hildebrand
had
rasped
his
nerves
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
if
there
was
one
living
man
whom
he
hated
and
over
whose
humiliation
he
rejoiced
it
was
sir
hildebrand
oates
he
yielded
to
the
swift
temptation
he
rose
hastily
and
gathered
up
his
papers
if
you
can
find
me
a
human
creature
in
this
universe
who
does
share
lady
oates
opinion
i
will
give
him
every
penny
i
am
worth
he
went
out
and
then
overcome
with
remorse
for
having
kicked
a
fallen
man
felt
inclined
to
hang
himself
but
he
knew
that
he
had
spoken
truly
meanwhile
sir
hildebrand
walked
up
and
down
the
little
visitors
room
at
the
club
where
the
interview
had
taken
place
passing
his
hand
over
his
indeterminate
moustache
and
long
blunt
chin
he
felt
neither
anger
nor
indignation
but
rather
the
dazed
dismay
of
a
prisoner
to
whom
the
judge
deals
a
severer
sentence
than
he
expected
after
a
while
he
sat
at
a
small
table
and
prepared
to
write
a
letter
connected
with
the
business
matters
he
had
just
discussed
with
haversham
but
the
words
would
not
come
his
brain
was
fogged
he
went
off
into
a
reverie
and
awoke
to
find
himself
scribbling
in
arabesque
fifteen
shillings
to
buy
a
scourge
after
a
solitary
dinner
at
the
club
that
evening
he
discovered
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
a
acquaintance
an
old
schoolfellow
one
colonel
bagot
reading
a
newspaper
he
approached
good
evening
bagot
colonel
bagot
raised
his
eyes
from
the
paper
nodded
and
resumed
his
reading
sir
hildebrand
deliberately
wheeled
a
chair
to
his
side
and
sat
down
can
i
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
certainly
my
dear
fellow
bagot
replied
putting
down
his
paper
what
kind
of
a
boy
was
i
at
school
what
kind
of
a
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
asked
the
astonished
colonel
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
kind
of
a
boy
i
was
said
sir
hildebrand
gravely
just
an
ordinary
chap
would
you
have
called
me
modest
generous
and
kind
what
in
god
name
are
you
driving
at
asked
the
colonel
twisting
himself
round
on
his
chair
at
your
opinion
of
me
was
i
modest
generous
and
kind
it
a
vital
question
it
a
damned
embarrassing
one
to
put
to
a
man
during
the
process
of
digestion
well
you
know
oates
you
always
were
a
queer
beggar
if
i
had
had
the
summing
up
of
you
i
should
have
said
from
vice
negative
well
yes
in
a
way
but
you
answered
me
now
another
do
you
think
i
treated
my
children
badly
really
oates
oh
confound
it
angrily
he
dusted
himself
free
from
the
long
ash
that
had
fallen
from
his
cigar
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
asked
such
a
question
i
do
you
known
me
all
your
life
i
want
you
to
answer
it
frankly
colonel
bagot
was
stout
red
and
choleric
sir
hildebrand
irritated
him
if
he
was
looking
for
trouble
he
should
have
it
i
think
you
treated
them
abominably
there
said
he
thank
you
said
sir
hildebrand
what
gasped
bagot
i
said
you
and
lastly
you
have
had
many
opportunities
of
judging
do
you
think
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
make
my
wife
happy
at
first
bagot
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
his
position
was
both
grotesque
and
intolerable
was
oates
going
mad
answering
the
surmise
sir
hildebrand
said
i
aware
my
question
is
extraordinary
perhaps
outrageous
but
i
am
quite
sane
did
she
look
crushed
as
though
she
were
not
allowed
to
have
a
will
of
her
own
it
was
impossible
not
to
see
that
the
man
was
in
a
dry
agony
of
earnestness
irritation
and
annoyance
fell
like
garments
from
shoulders
you
really
want
to
get
at
the
exact
truth
as
far
as
i
can
give
it
you
from
the
depth
of
my
soul
said
sir
hildebrand
then
answered
bagot
quite
simply
i
sorry
to
say
unpleasant
things
but
i
think
lady
oates
led
a
dog
life
and
so
does
everybody
that
just
what
i
wanted
to
be
sure
of
said
sir
hildebrand
rising
he
bent
his
head
courteously
good
night
bagot
and
he
went
away
with
dreary
dignity
vi
a
cloud
settled
on
sir
hildebrand
mind
through
which
he
saw
immediate
things
murkily
he
passed
days
of
unaccustomed
loneliness
and
inaction
he
walked
the
familiar
streets
of
london
like
one
in
a
dream
one
afternoon
he
found
himself
gazing
with
unspeculative
eye
into
the
window
of
a
small
roman
catholic
repository
where
crucifixes
and
statues
of
the
virgin
and
child
and
rosaries
and
religious
books
and
pictures
were
exposed
for
sale
until
realisation
of
the
objects
at
which
he
had
been
staring
dawned
upon
his
mind
he
had
not
been
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
shop
the
shadow
of
a
smile
passed
over
his
face
he
entered
an
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
was
behind
the
counter
do
you
keep
scourges
asked
sir
hildebrand
no
sir
replied
the
old
man
somewhat
astonished
that
unfortunate
very
unfortunate
said
sir
hildebrand
regarding
him
dully
i
in
need
of
one
even
among
certain
of
the
religious
orders
the
discipline
is
forbidden
nowadays
replied
the
old
man
among
certain
others
it
is
practised
i
believe
so
then
scourges
are
procurable
i
will
ask
you
to
get
one
or
have
one
made
according
to
religious
pattern
i
will
pay
fifteen
shillings
for
it
it
could
not
possibly
cost
that
a
mere
matter
of
wood
and
string
i
will
pay
neither
more
nor
less
said
sir
hildebrand
laying
on
the
counter
the
cheque
which
he
had
endorsed
and
his
card
i
i
have
made
a
vow
it
a
matter
of
conscience
kindly
send
it
to
the
club
address
he
walked
out
of
the
shop
somewhat
lighter
of
heart
his
instinct
for
the
scrupulous
satisfied
the
abominable
cheque
no
longer
burned
through
and
raiment
and
body
and
corroded
his
soul
he
had
devoted
the
money
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
the
precision
was
soothed
in
puzzling
darkness
he
had
also
taken
an
enormous
psychological
stride
the
familiar
club
became
unbearable
his
abhorrent
friends
and
acquaintances
outside
and
they
were
legion
who
taking
pity
on
his
loneliness
sought
him
out
and
invited
him
to
their
houses
he
shunned
in
a
curious
terror
he
was
forever
meeting
them
in
the
streets
behind
their
masks
of
sympathy
he
read
his
wife
deadly
accusation
and
its
confirmation
which
he
had
received
from
haversham
and
bagot
when
the
scourge
arrived
a
instrument
in
a
cardboard
box
he
sat
for
a
long
time
in
his
club
bedroom
drawing
the
knotted
cords
between
his
fingers
lost
in
retrospective
thought
and
suddenly
a
scene
flashed
across
his
mind
venice
the
first
days
of
their
honeymoon
the
renaissance
façade
of
a
church
in
a
campo
bounded
by
a
canal
where
their
gondola
lay
waiting
a
tattered
beggar
holding
out
his
hat
by
the
church
door
he
hildebrand
stalked
majestically
past
his
wife
following
near
the
he
turned
and
discovered
her
in
the
act
of
tendering
from
her
purse
a
piece
to
the
beggar
who
had
hobbled
expectant
in
her
wake
hildebrand
interposed
a
hand
the
shock
accidentally
jerked
the
coin
from
hers
it
rolled
the
beggar
threw
himself
prone
in
order
to
seize
it
but
it
rolled
into
the
canal
an
agony
of
despair
and
supplication
mounted
from
the
tatterdemalion
eyes
oh
hildebrand
give
him
another
certainly
not
he
replied
it
immoral
to
encourage
mendicity
she
wept
in
the
gondola
he
thought
her
silly
and
told
her
so
they
landed
at
the
molo
and
he
took
her
to
drink
chocolate
at
florian
on
the
piazza
she
bent
her
meek
head
over
the
cup
and
the
tears
fell
into
it
a
venetian
couple
who
sat
at
the
next
table
stared
at
her
passed
remarks
and
giggled
outright
with
the
ordinary
and
exquisite
italian
politeness
my
dear
eliza
said
hildebrand
if
you
ca
help
being
a
victim
to
sickly
sentimentality
at
least
as
my
wife
you
must
learn
to
control
yourself
in
public
and
meekly
she
controlled
herself
and
drank
her
salted
chocolate
in
compliance
with
a
timidly
expressed
desire
and
in
order
to
show
his
forgiveness
he
escorted
her
into
the
open
square
and
like
any
vulgar
cook
tourist
bought
her
a
paper
cornet
of
dried
peas
wherewith
to
his
martyrdom
she
fed
the
pigeons
seeing
an
old
man
some
way
off
do
the
same
she
scattered
a
few
grains
along
the
brim
of
her
leghorn
hat
and
presently
so
still
she
was
and
gracious
an
iridescent
swarm
enveloped
her
eating
from
both
hands
outstretched
and
encircling
her
head
like
a
halo
for
the
moment
she
was
the
embodiment
of
innocent
happiness
but
hildebrand
thought
her
notoriously
absurd
and
when
he
saw
lord
and
lady
benham
approaching
them
from
the
piazzetta
he
stepped
forward
and
with
an
abrupt
gesture
sent
the
pigeons
scurrying
away
and
she
looked
for
the
vanished
birds
with
much
the
same
scared
piteousness
as
the
beggar
had
looked
for
the
lost
piece
after
thirty
years
the
memory
of
that
afternoon
flamed
vivid
as
he
drew
the
strings
of
the
idle
scourge
between
his
fingers
and
then
the
puzzling
darkness
overspread
his
mind
after
a
while
he
replaced
the
scourge
in
the
cardboard
box
and
summoned
the
club
valet
pack
up
all
my
things
said
he
i
am
going
abroad
by
the
eleven
train
from
victoria
vii
few
and
stranger
still
few
guests
stay
at
the
albergo
tonelli
in
venice
for
one
thing
it
has
not
many
rooms
for
another
it
is
far
from
the
grand
canal
and
for
yet
another
the
fat
proprietor
ettore
tonelli
and
his
fatter
wife
are
too
sluggish
of
body
and
brain
to
worry
about
who
have
to
be
communicated
with
in
outlandish
tongues
and
for
their
supposed
comfort
demand
all
sorts
of
exotic
foolishness
such
as
baths
punctuality
and
information
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
fusty
old
pictures
and
the
exact
tariff
of
gondolas
the
house
was
filled
from
year
end
to
year
end
with
italian
commercial
travellers
and
ettore
ways
and
their
ways
corresponded
to
a
nicety
the
albergo
tonelli
was
a
little
palazzo
its
lombardic
crocketed
windows
gaily
picked
out
in
white
and
it
dominated
the
wherein
it
was
situated
in
the
centre
of
the
tiny
square
was
a
marble
richly
carved
and
by
its
side
a
pump
from
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
vague
circumambient
dwellings
drew
the
water
to
wash
the
underlinen
which
hung
to
dry
from
the
windows
a
great
segment
of
the
corner
diagonally
opposite
the
albergo
was
occupied
by
the
bare
and
rudely
swelling
brick
apse
of
a
church
two
inconsiderable
thoroughfares
five
foot
wide
lead
from
the
to
the
wide
world
of
venice
it
was
hither
that
sir
hildebrand
oates
after
a
week
of
tumult
at
one
of
the
great
grand
canal
hotels
and
after
horrified
examination
of
the
question
of
balance
of
expenditure
over
income
found
his
way
through
the
kind
offices
of
a
gondolier
to
whom
he
had
promised
twenty
francs
if
he
could
conduct
him
to
the
forgotten
church
the
memorable
scene
of
the
adventure
of
the
beggar
and
the
piece
with
unerring
instinct
the
gondolier
had
rowed
him
to
santa
maria
formosa
the
very
spot
sir
hildebrand
troubled
himself
neither
with
the
church
nor
the
wonder
of
palma
vecchio
santa
barbara
within
but
with
bent
brow
traced
the
course
of
the
lame
beggar
from
the
step
to
the
and
the
course
of
the
rolling
coin
from
his
eliza
hand
into
the
canal
then
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
deep
in
thought
and
finally
drew
a
piece
from
his
pocket
and
recrossing
the
campo
handed
it
gravely
to
a
the
successor
of
the
lame
man
who
sat
sunning
herself
on
the
spacious
marble
seat
by
the
side
of
the
great
door
when
he
returned
to
the
hotel
he
gave
the
gondolier
his
colossal
reward
and
made
a
friend
for
life
giuseppe
delighted
at
finding
an
english
gentleman
who
could
converse
readily
hi
italian
for
sir
hildebrand
a
man
of
considerable
culture
possessed
a
working
knowledge
of
three
or
four
european
languages
expressed
his
gratitude
on
subsequent
excursions
by
overflowing
with
picturesque
anecdote
both
historical
and
personal
a
pathetic
craving
for
intercourse
with
his
kind
and
the
solace
of
obtaining
it
from
one
remote
from
his
social
environment
drew
sir
hildebrand
into
queer
sympathy
with
a
genuine
human
being
giuseppe
treated
him
with
a
respectful
familiarity
which
he
had
never
before
encountered
in
a
member
of
the
lower
classes
one
afternoon
on
the
silent
side
of
the
giudecca
turning
round
on
his
cushions
he
confided
to
the
lean
bronzed
rhythmically
working
figure
standing
behind
him
something
of
the
puzzledom
of
his
soul
guiseppe
in
the
practical
italian
way
interpreted
the
confidences
as
a
desire
to
escape
from
the
and
fantastically
expensive
quarters
of
the
city
into
some
unruffled
haven
that
evening
he
interviewed
the
second
cousin
of
his
wife
the
signora
tonelli
of
the
albergo
of
that
name
and
the
next
day
sir
hildebrand
took
possession
of
the
front
room
overlooking
the
on
the
or
second
floor
of
the
hotel
and
here

the

of

important
and
impeccable
personage
the
exact
temperature
of
whose
bath
water
had
been
to
a
trembling
household
a
matter
of
as
much
vital
concern
as
the
salvation
of
their
own
souls
entered
upon
a
life
of
queer
discomfort
privation
and
humility
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
experienced
the
makeshift
of
the
room
a
chamber
too
cold
and
comfortless
with
one
scraggy
rug
by
the
bedside
to
mitigate
the
rigour
of
an
inlaid
floor
looking
like
a
galantine
of
veal
once
the
pride
of
the
palazzo
and
meagrely
furnished
with
the
barest
objects
of
necessity
and
these
of
monstrous
and
incongruous
ugliness
and
he
learned
in
the
redolent
restaurant
downstairs
the
way
to
eat
spaghetti
like
a
contented
beast
and
the
relish
of
sour
wine
and
the
overrated
importance
of
the
cleanliness
of
cutlery
in
his
dignified
acceptance
of
surroundings
that
to
him
were
squalid
he
manifested
his
essential
breeding
the
correct
courtesy
of
his
demeanour
gained
for
the
signore
the
wholehearted
respect
of
the
signore
and
signora
tonelli
and
the
famous
scourge
nailed
symbolically
over
his
hard
little
bed
procured
him
a
terrible
reputation
for
piety
in
the
after
a
while
indeed
as
soon
as
he
had
settled
to
his
new
mode
of
living
the
inveterate
habit
of
punctilio
caused
him
almost
unconsciously
to
fix
by
the
clock
his
day
routine
called
at
eight
a
kind
of
eight
conjectured
by
the
tousled
sloven
of
a
he
dressed
with
scrupulous
care
at
nine
he
descended
for
his
morning
coffee
to
the
chill
deserted
restaurant
for
all
the
revolution
in
his
existence
he
could
not
commit
the
immorality
of
breakfasting
in
his
bedroom
at
he
regained
his
room
where
till
eleven
he
wrote
by
the
window
overlooking
the
then
with
gloves
and
cane
to
outward
appearance
the
immaculate
the
impeccable
sir
hildebrand
oates
of
eresby
manor
he
walked
through
the
narrow
twisting
streets
and
over
bridges
and
across
and
to
the
piazza
san
marco
as
soon
as
he
neared
the
of
the
great
square
a
seller
of
corn
and
peas
approached
him
handed
him
a
paper
cornet
from
which
sir
hildebrand
with
awful
gravity
fed
the
pigeons
and
the
pigeons
looked
for
him
too
and
they
perched
on
his
arms
and
his
shoulders
and
even
on
the
crown
of
his
homburg
hat
the
brim
of
which
he
had
by
way
of
solemn
rite
filled
with
grain
until
the
gaunt
grey
unsmiling
man
was
hidden
in
fluttering
iridescence
and
tourists
and
idlers
used
to
come
every
day
and
look
at
him
as
at
one
of
the
sights
of
venice
the
supply
finished
sir
hildebrand
went
to
the
café
florian
on
the
south
of
the
piazza
and
ordering
a
which
he
seldom
drank
read
the
de
la
until
the
midday
gun
sent
the
pigeons
whirring
to
their
favourite
cornices
then
sir
hildebrand
retraced
his
steps
to
the
albergo
tonelli
lunched
read
till
three
wrote
till
five
and
again
went
out
to
take
the
air
dinner
half
an
hour
courtly
gossip
in
the
cramped
and
smelly
apology
for
a
lounge
with
landlord
or
a
commercial
traveller
disinclined
for
theatre
or
or
the
absorbing
amusement
of
venice
walking
in
the
piazza
or
along
the
riva
schiavoni
and
then
to
read
or
write
till
bedtime
no
englishman
of
any
social
position
can
stand
daily
in
the
piazza
san
marco
without
now
and
then
coming
across
acquaintances
least
of
all
a
man
of
such
importance
in
his
day
as
sir
hildebrand
oates
he
accepted
the
greetings
of
friends
with
courteous
resignation
we
at
the
hôtel
de
where
are
you
staying
sir
hildebrand
i
live

one
of
themselves

next
month
or

am
overwhelmed
with
work
i
so
sorry
if

have
any
time
to
spare
and
would
like
to
get
off
the
beaten
track
let
me
recommend
you
to
wander
through
the
giudecca
on
foot
i
hope
lady
elizabeth
is
well
i
so
glad
will
you
give
her
my
kindest
regards
and
sir
hildebrand
would
make
his
irreproachable
bow
and
take
his
leave
no
one
learned
where
he
had
made
his
home
in
venice
in
fact
no
one
but
thomas
cook
and
son
knew
his
address
he
banked
with
them
and
they
forwarded
his
letters
to
the
albergo
tonelli
it
has
been
said
that
sir
hildebrand
occupied
much
of
his
time
in
writing
and
he
himself
declared
that
he
was
overwhelmed
with
work
he
was
indeed
engaged
in
an
absorbing
task
of
literary
composition
and
his
reference
library
consisted
in
thirty
or
forty
volumes
each
fitted
with
a
clasp
and
lock
of
which
the
key
hung
at
the
end
of
his
and
every
page
of
every
volume
was
filled
with
his
own
small
precise
handwriting
he
made
slow
progress
for
the
work
demanded
concentrated
thought
and
close
reasoning
the
rumour
of
his
occupation
having
spread
through
the
parrocchia
he
acquired
in
addition
to
that
of
a
pietist
the
reputation
of
an
he
became
the
pride
of
the
when
he
crossed
the
little
square
the
inhabitants
pointed
him
out
to
less
fortunate
there
was
the
great
english
noble
who
had
made
vows
of
poverty
and
gave
himself
the
discipline
and
wrote
wonderful
works
of
theology
and
men
touched
their
hats
and
women
saluted
shyly
and
sir
hildebrand
punctiliously
and
with
a
queer
pathetic
gratitude
responded
even
the
children
gave
him
a
buon
giorno
signore
and
smiled
up
into
his
face
unconscious
of
the
pious
scholar
he
was
supposed
to
be
and
of
the
almighty
potentate
that
he
had
been
once
yielding
to
an
obscure
though
powerful
instinct
he
purchased
in
the
merceria
a
packet
of
chocolates
and
on
entering
his
presented
them
with
stupendous
gravity
concealing
extreme
embarrassment
to
a
little
gang
of
urchins
encouraged
by
a
dazzling
success
he
made
it
a
rule
to
distribute
sweetmeats
every
saturday
morning
to
the
children
of
the
after
a
while
he
learned
their
names
and
idiosyncrasies
and
held
solemn
though
kindly
speech
with
them
manifesting
an
interest
in
their
games
and
questioning
them
sympathetically
as
to
their
scholastic
attainments
sometimes
gathering
from
their
talk
a
notion
of
the
desperate
poverty
of
parents
he
put
a
lire
or
two
into
grubby
little
fists
in
spite
of
a
lifelong
conviction
of
the
immorality
of
indiscriminate
almsgiving
and
dark
haggard
mothers
blessed
him
and
stood
in
his
way
to
catch
his
smile
all
of
which
was
pleasant
though
exceedingly
puzzling
to
sir
hildebrand
oates
viii
between
two
and
three
years
after
their
mother
death
sir
hildebrand
son
and
daughter
who
bore
each
other
a
devoted
affection
and
carried
on
a
constant
correspondence
arranged
to
meet
in
england
godfrey
travelling
from
canada
sybil
with
her
children
from
india
the
first
thing
they
learned
from
haversham
the
lawyer
was
the
extent
of
their
father
financial
ruin
they
knew
many
kind
friends
had
told
them
that
he
had
had
losses
and
had
retired
from
public
life
but
living
out
of
the
world
and
accepting
their
childhood
tradition
of
his
incalculable
wealth
they
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
he
continued
to
lead
a
life
of
elegant
luxury
when
haversham
one
of
the
few
people
who
really
knew
informed
them
with
a
revengeful
smile
that
their
father
could
not
possibly
have
more
than
a
hundred
or
two
a
year
they
were
shocked
to
the
depths
of
their
clean
english
souls
the
great
panjandrum
arbiter
of
destinies
had
been
brought
low
was
living
in
obscurity
in
italy
the
pity
of
it
as
they
interchanged
glances
the
same
thought
leaped
into
the
eyes
of
each
we
must
look
him
up
and
see
what
can
be
done
said
godfrey
of
course
dear
said
sybil
i
offered
him
the
use
of
eresby
but
he
was
too
proud
to
take
it
and
i
never
offered
him
anything
at
all
said
sybil
i
should
advise
you
said
haversham
to
leave
sir
hildebrand
alone
godfrey
a
young
man
and
one
who
was
accustomed
to
arrive
at
his
own
decisions
and
moreover
did
not
like
haversham
gripped
his
sister
by
the
arm
whatever
advice
you
give
me
haversham
i
will
take
just
when
i
think
it
necessary
that
is
the
attitude
of
most
of
my
clients
replied
haversham
drily
whether
it
is
a
sound
attitude
or
not
he
waved
an
expressive
hand
we
go
and
hunt
him
up
anyway
said
godfrey
if
he
impossible
we
can
come
back
if
he
is
so
much
the
better
what
do
you
say
sybil
sybil
said
what
he
knew
she
would
say
sir
hildebrand
address
is
vague
remarked
haversham
cook
venice
what
more
in
hades
do
we
want
cried
the
young
man
so
after
sybil
had
made
arrangements
for
the
safe
keeping
of
her
offspring
and
godfrey
and
herself
had
written
to
announce
their
coming
the
pair
set
out
for
venice
we
are
very
sorry
but
we
are
unable
to
give
you
sir
hildebrand
oates
address
said
thomas
cook
and
son
godfrey
protested
we
are
his
son
and
daughter
he
said
in
effect
we
have
reason
to
believe
our
father
is
living
in
poverty
we
have
written
and
he
has
not
replied
we
must
find
him

lay

hearts
sank
low

greeted
them
what
was
their
pleasure
sir
hildebrand
oates
at
first
from
his
rapid
and
incomprehensible
italian
they
could
gather
little
else
than
the
fact
of
their
father
absence
from
home
after
a
while
the
reiteration
of
the
words
made
an
impression

their
minds

pneumonia

had
stood
to
feed
the
pigeons
in
the
rain
in
the
northeast
wind

had
contracted
a
chill
when
they
thought
he
was
dying
they
sent
for
the
english
doctor

had
attended
him
before
for
trifling
ailments
and
unconscious
he
had
been
transported
to
the
english
hospital
in
the
giudecca

there
he
was
now
a
thousand
pities
he
should
die
the
dearest
and
most
revered
man
the
whole
neighbourhood
who
loved
him
was
stricken
with
grief
they
prayed
for
him
in

church
the
signore

see

gained
confirmation
of
the
amazing
fact
that
in
this
squalid
rickety
little
square
sir
hildebrand
had
managed
to
make
himself
beloved
childhood
memories
rose
within
them
but
haunting
sayings
of
servants

which
had
impressed
upon

of
religious
life
but
the
flagellum
over
the
bed
and
that
seemed
curiously
new
and
unused
again
they
looked
around
the
bare
characterless
room
characteristic
only
of
its
occupant
by
its
scrupulous
tidiness
yet
one
object
at
last
attracted
their
attention
on
a
deal
by
the
window
lay
a
thick
pile
of
manuscript
godfrey
turned
the
brown
paper
covering
standing
together
brother
and
sister
read
the
astounding
an
enquiry
into
my
wife
justification
for
the
following
terms
of
her
will
will
and
bequeath
to
my
husband
sir
hildebrand
oates
knight
the
sum
of
fifteen
shillings
to
buy
himself
a
scourge
to
do
penance
for
the
arrogance
uncharitableness
and
cruelty
with
which
he
has
treated
myself
and
my
beloved
children
for
the
last
thirty
years
this
dispassionate
enquiry
i
dedicate
to
my
son
godfrey
and
my
daughter
sybil
brother
and
sister
regarded
each
other
with
drawn
faces
and
mutually
questioning
eyes
we
ca
leave
this
lying
about
said
godfrey
and
he
tucked
the
manuscript
under
his
arm
the
gondola
took
them
through
the
narrow
waterways
to
the
grand
canal
of
the
giudecca
where
on
the
zattere
side
all
the
merchant
shipping
of
venice
and
trieste
and
fiume
and
genoa
finds
momentary
rest
and
across
to
the
low
of
the
canal
cutting
through
the
island
on
the
side
of
which
is
lady
layard
modest
english
hospital
yes
said
the
matron
sir
hildebrand
was
there
pneumonia
getting
on
as
well
as
could
be
expected
but
impossible
to
see
him
she
would
telephone
to
their
hotel
in
the
morning
that
night
until
dawn
godfrey
read
the
manuscript
a
document
of
interest
it
was
neither
an
pro
vita
nor
a
cry
of
confession
but
a
minute
analysis
of
every
remembered
incident
in
the
relations
between
his
family
and
himself
from
the
first
pragmatical
days
of
his
wedding
journey
and
judicially
he
delivered
judgments
in
the
terse
lucid
french
form
whereas
i
etc
and
whereas
my
wife
etc
setting
forth
and
balancing
the
facts
it
is
my
opinion
that
i
acted
arrogantly
or
uncharitably
or
cruelly
now
and
again
though
rarely
the
judgments
went
in
his
favour
but
invariably
the
words
were
added
i
am
willing
however
in
this
case
to
submit
to
the
decision
of
any
arbitrator
or
court
of
appeal
my
children
may
think
it
worth
while
to
appoint
the
last
words
scrawled
shakily
in
pencil
were
i
have
not
to
my
great
regret
been
able
to
bring
this
record
but
as
i
am
very
ill
and
at
my
age
may
not
recover
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
say
that
as
far
as
my
two
years
painful
examination
into
my
past
life
warrants
my
judgment
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
my
wife
had
ample
justification
for
the
terms
she
employed
regarding
me
in
her
will
furthermore
if
as
is
probable
i
should
die
of
my
illness
i
should
like
my
children
to
know
that
long
ere
this
i
have
deeply
desired
in
my
loneliness
to
stretch
out
my
arms
to
them
in
affection
and
beg
their
forgiveness
but
that
i
have
been
prevented
from
so
doing
by
the
appalling
fear
that
i
being
now
very
poor
and
they
being
very
rich
my
overtures
considering
the
lack
of
affection
i
have
exhibited
to
them
in
the
past
might
be
misinterpreted
the
british
consul
here
who
has
kindly
consented
to
be
my
executor
will
and
then
strength
had
evidently
failed
him
and
he
could
write
no
more
the
next
morning
godfrey
related
to
his
sister
what
he
had
read
and
gave
her
the
manuscript
to
read
at
her
convenience
and
together
they
went
to
the
hospital
and
obtained
from
the
doctor
his
somewhat
pessimistic
report
and
then
again
they
visited
the
albergo
tonelli
and
learned
more
of
the
strange
stiff
and
benevolent
life
of
sir
hildebrand
oates
once
more
they
mounted
to
the
cold
cheerless
room
where
their
father
had
spent
the
past
two
years
godfrey
unhooked
the
scourge
from
the
nail
what
are
you
going
to
do
sybil
asked
her
eyes
full
of
tears
i
going
to
burn
the
damned
thing
whether
he
lives
or
dies
the
poor
old
chap
penance
is
at
an
end
by
god
he
has
done
enough
he
turned
upon
her
swiftly
you
do
feel
any
resentment
against
him
now
do
you
resentment
her
voice
broke
on
the
word
and
she
cast
herself
on
the
hard
little
bed
and
sobbed
ix
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
a
new
sir
hildebrand
oates
with
a
humble
and
a
contrite
heart
which
we
are
told
the
lord
doth
not
despise
came
into
residence
once
more
at
eresby
manor
agent
for
his
son
and
guardian
of
his
daughter
children
godfrey
transferred
his
legal
business
from
haversham
to
a
younger
practitioner
in
the
neighbourhood
to
whom
sir
hildebrand
showed
a
stately
deference
and
every
day
being
a
man
of
habit
instinctive
habit
which
no
revolution
of
the
soul
can
alter
he
visited
his
wife
grave
in
the
little
churchyard
a
stone
throw
from
the
manor
house
and
in
his
fancy
a
cloud
of
pigeons
came
iridescent
darkening
the
air
the
county
called
but
he
held
himself
aloof
he
was
no
longer
the
unassailable
man
he
had
come
through
many
fires
to
a
wisdom
undreamed
of
by
the
county
human
love
had
touched
him
with
its
simple
angel
wing
the
love
of
son
and
daughter
the
love
of
the
rude
souls
in
the
squalid
venetian
and
the
patter
of
feet
the
soft
and
trusting
touch
of
children
hands
the
glad
welcome
of
children
voices
had
brought
him
back
to
the
elemental
wells
of
happiness
one
afternoon
the
butler
entering
the
with
the
announcement
his
grace
the
duke
of
gasped
unable
to
finish
the
title
for
there
was
sir
hildebrand
oates
younger
at
than
he
was
at
thirty
lying
prone
on
the
hearthrug
with
a
pair
of
flushed
infants
astride
on
the
softer
portions
of
his
back
using
the
once
almighty
man
as
a
being
of
little
account
sir
hildebrand
turned
his
long
chin
and
long
nose
up
towards
his
visitor
and
there
was
a
new
smile
in
his
eyes
sorry
duke
said
he
but
you
see
i
ca
get
up
my
shadow
friends
my
gentle
readers
have
been
good
enough
to
ask
me
what
some
of
the
folk
whose
adventures
i
have
from
time
to
time
described
have
done
in
the
great
war
it
is
a
large
question
for
they
are
so
many
most
of
them
have
done
things
they
never
dreamed
they
would
be
called
upon
to
do
those
that
survived
till
have
worked
like
the
rest
of
the
community
in
england
and
france
according
to
their
several
capacities
in
the
holiest
crusade
in
the
history
of
mankind
well
let
me
plunge
at
once
into
the
midst
of
things
about
a
year
ago
the
great
voice
of
jaffery
came
booming
across
my
lawn
he
was
a
and
a
and
his
great
red
beard
had
gone
the
same
but
yet
a
subtly
different
jaffery
liosha
was
driving
a
in
france
he
told
me
she
was
having
the
time
of
her
life
i
have
heard
too
of
my
old
friend
sir
marcus
leaner
than
ever
and
clad
in
khaki
and
sitting
in
a
dreary
office
in
havre
with
piles
of
army
forms
before
him
on
which
he
had
checked
of
ever
since
the
war
began
and
if
you
visit
a
certain
hospital
in
manchester
of
all
places
so
dislocating
has
been
the
war
there
you
will
still
see
lady
ordeyne
it
always
gives
me
a
shock
to
think
of
carlotta
as
lady
ordeyne
matronly
and
inefficient
but
the
joy
and
delight
of
every
wounded
man
and
septimus
did
you
not
know
that
the
dix
gun
was
used
at
the
front
his
great
new
invention
the
i
regret
to
say
was
looked
on
coldly
by
the
war
office
now
that
peace
has
come
he
is
trying
so
sir
clem
sypher
tells
me
to
adapt
it
to
the
intensive
cultivation
of
whitebait
and
i
have
heard
a
few
stories
of
others
here
is
one
told
me
by
a
french
officer
one
colonel
girault
the
scene
was
a
road
bridge
on
the
outskirts
of
the
zone
of
the
armies
his
car
had
broken
down
hopelessly
and
with
much
profane
language
he
swung
to
the
the
sentry
saluted
he
was
an
elderly
territorial
with
a
ragged
pair
of
canvas
trousers
and
a
ragged
old
blue
uniform
coat
and
a
battered
kepi
and
an
ancient
rifle
a
scarecrow
of
a
sentry
such
as
were
seen
on
all
the
roads
of
france
how
far
is
it
to
the
village
two
kilometres
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
voice
and
in
the
dark
humorous
eyes
say
what
is
your
name
asked
colonel
girault
gaston
de
nérac
murmured
the
colonel
turning
away
exalted
rank
makes
gigi
girault
forget
the
lessons
of
humility
he
learned
in
the
café
delphine
colonel
girault
stood
with
mouth
agape
then
he
laughed
and
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
dilapidated
sentry
it
is
true
it
is
paragot
then
afterwards
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
nothing
said
paragot
the
has
done
everything
he
has
allowed
me
to
be
a
soldier
of
france
in
my
old
age
and
colonel
girault
told
me
that
he
asked
for
news
of
the
little
asticot
a
painter
who
ought
by
now
to
be
famous
paragot
replied
he
is
over
there
killing
boches
for
his
old
master
do
you
remember
paul
savelli
the
fortunate
youth
he
lived
to
see
his
dream
of
a
great
awakened
england
come
true
he
fell
leading
his
men
on
a
glorious
day
his
princess
wears
on
her
nurse
uniform
the
victoria
cross
which
he
had
earned
in
that
last
heroic
charge
but
did
not
live
to
wear
and
she
walks
serene
and
gracious
teaching
proud
women
how
to
mourn
what
of
quixtus
he
sacrificed
his
leisure
to
the
task
of
sitting
in
a
dim
room
of
the
foreign
office
for
ten
hours
a
day
in
front
of
masses
of
german
publications
and
scheduling
with
his
scientific
method
and
accuracy
the
german
lies
clementina
saw
him
only
on
sundays
she
turned
her
beautiful
house
on
the
river
into
a
maternity
home
for
soldiers
wives
tommy
the
graceless
when
last
home
on
leave
said
that
she
was
capable
of
murdering
the
mothers
so
as
to
collar
all
the
babies
for
herself
and
clementina
smiled
as
though
acknowledging
a
compliment
once
every
few
years
you
are
quite
intelligent
tommy
she
replied
i
have
heard
too
that
simon
who
jested
so
with
life
and
lola
of
the
maimed
face
went
out
to
a
serbian
hospital
and
together
won
through
the
horror
of
the
retreat
they
are
still
out
there
sharing
in
serbia
victory
and
the
work
of
serbia
reconstruction
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
in
regent
street
i
was
vehemently
accosted
by
a
little
man
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
french
captain
he
had
bright
eyes
and
a
clean
shaven
chin
which
for
the
moment
perplexed
me
and
a
swaggering
moustache
just
over
for
a
few
hours
to
see
the
wife
and
little
jean
but
said
i
what
are
you
doing
in
this
kit
you
went
out
as
a
territorial
cher
he
cried
straddling
across
the
pavement
to
the
obstruction
of
traffic
and
regarding
me
mirthfully
it
is
the
greatest
farce
on
the
world
imagine
me
i
a
territorial
as
you
call
me
bearded
a
lion
of
a
general
of
division
in
his
den
and
i
came
out
a
captain
come
into
the
café
royal
and
tell
you
all
about
it
his
story
i
can
not
set
down
here
but
it
is
not
the
least
amazing
of
the
joyous
adventures
of
my
friend
aristide
pujol
what
doggie
and
jeanne
did
in
the
war
my
gentle
readers
know
their
first
child
was
born
on
the
glorious
morning
of
november
amid
the
pealing
of
bells
and
shouts
of
rejoicing
when
doggie
crept
into
the
sacred
room
of
wonderment
he
found
the
babe
wrapped
up
in
the
union
jack
and
the
tricolour
there
only
one
name
for
him
whispered
jeanne
with
streaming
eyes
victor
to
leave

for
the
brutal
fact
you
may
say
these
friends
of
mine
are
but
shadows
it
is
true
but
shadows
are
not
cast
by
nothingness
these
friends
must
live
substantially
and
corporeally
although
in
the
flesh
i
have
never
met
them
some
strange
and
unguessed
sun
has
cast
their
shadows
across
my
path
i
that
somewhere
or
the
other
they
have
their
actual
habitation
and
i
know
that
they
have
done
the
things
i
have
above
