king
midas
a
romance
by
upton
sinclair
i
dreamed
that
soul
might
dare
the
pain
unlike
the
prince
of
old
and
wrest
from
heaven
the
fiery
touch
that
turns
all
things
to
gold
new
york
and
london
note
in
the
course
of
this
story
the
author
has
had
occasion
to
refer
to
beethoven
sonata
appassionata
as
containing
a
suggestion
of
the
opening
theme
of
the
fifth
symphony
he
has
often
seen
this
stated
and
believed
that
the
statement
was
generally
accepted
as
true
since
writing
however
he
has
heard
the
opinion
expressed
by
a
musician
who
is
qualified
to
speak
as
an
authority
that
the
two
themes
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
the
author
himself
is
not
competent
to
have
an
opinion
on
the
subject
but
because
the
statement
as
first
made
is
closely
bound
up
with
the
story
he
has
allowed
it
to
stand
unaltered
the
two
extracts
from
macdowell
sketches
on
pages
and
are
reprinted
with
the
kind
permission
of
professor
macdowell

merry
month
of

chapter

it
was
that
time
of
year
when
all
the
world
belongs
to
poets
for
their
harvest
of
joy
when
those
who
seek
the
country
not
for
beauty
but
for
coolness
have
as
yet
thought
nothing
about
it
and
when
those
who
dwell
in
it
all
the
time
are
too
busy
planting
for
another
harvest
to
have
any
thought
of
poets
so
that
the
latter
and
the
few
others
who
keep
something
in
their
hearts
to
chime
with
the
great
have
the
woods
and
waters
all
for
their
own
for
two
joyful
months
from
the
time
that
the
first
snowy
bloodroot
has
blossomed
until
the
wild
rose
has
faded
and
nature
has
no
more
to
say
in
those
two
months
there
are
two
weeks
the
ones
that
usher
in
the
may
that
bear
the
prize
of
all
the
year
for
glory
the
commonest
trees
wear
green
and
silver
then
that
would
outshine
a
coronation
robe
and
if
a
man
has
any
of
that
prodigality
of
spirit
which
makes
imagination
he
may
hear
the
song
of
all
the
world
it
was
on
such
a
may
morning
in
the
midst
of
a
great
forest
of
pine
trees
one
of
those
forests
whose
floors
are
ruins
that
give
to
them
the
solemnity
of
age
and
demand
humility
from
those
who
walk
within
their
silences
there
was
not
much
there
to
tell
of
the
springtime
for
the
pines
are
unsympathetic
but
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
more
wealth
had
been
flung
about
on
the
carpeting
beneath
where
the
moss
was
not
were
flowing
beds
of
fern
and
the
ground
was
dotted
with
slender
harebells
and
the
dusty
corydalis
while
from
all
the
rocks
the
bright
red
lanterns
of
the
columbine
were
dangling
of
the
beauty
so
wonderfully
squandered
there
was
but
one
witness
a
young
man
who
was
walking
slowly
along
stepping
as
it
seemed
where
there
were
no
flowers
and
who
whenever
he
stopped
to
gaze
at
a
group
of
them
left
them
unmolested
in
their
happiness
he
was
tall
and
slenderly
built
with
a
pale
face
shadowed
by
dark
hair
he
was
clad
in
black
and
carried
in
one
hand
a
book
which
however
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
a
short
distance
ahead
was
a
path
scarcely
marked
except
where
the
trees
were
trodden
through
down
this
the
young
man
turned
and
a
while
later
as
his
ear
was
caught
by
the
sound
of
falling
water
he
quickened
his
steps
a
trifle
until
he
came
to
a
little
streamlet
which
flowed
through
the
forest
taking
for
its
bed
the
fairest
spot
in
that
wonderland
of
beauty
it
fled
from
rock
to
rock
covered
with
the
brightest
of
bright
green
moss
and
with
tender
fern
that
was
but
half
uncurled
and
it
flashed
in
the
sunlit
places
and
tinkled
from
the
deep
black
shadows
ever
racing
faster
as
if
to
see
what
more
the
forest
had
to
show
the
young
man
look
had
been
anxious
before
but
he
brightened
in
spite
of
himself
in
the
company
of
the
streamlet
not
far
beyond
was
a
place
where
a
tiny
rill
flowed
down
from
the
high
rocks
above
and
where
the
path
broadened
out
considerably
it
was
a
darkly
shadowed
spot
and
the
little
rill
was
gathered
in
a
sunken
barrel
which
the
genius
of
the
place
had
made
haste
to
cover
with
the
green
uniform
worn
by
all
else
that
was
to
be
seen
beside
the
spring
thus
formed
the
young
man
seated
himself
and
after
glancing
impatiently
at
his
watch
turned
his
gaze
upon
the
beauty
that
was
about
him
upon
the
neighboring
rocks
the
columbine
and
harebell
held
high
revel
but
he
did
not
notice
them
so
much
as
a
new
sight
that
flashed
upon
his
eye
for
the
pool
where
the
two
streamlets
joined
was
like
a
nest
which
the
had
taken
for
its
home
the
water
was
covered
with
its
bright
green
and
yellow
and
the
young
man
gazed
at
the
blossoms
with
eager
delight
until
finally
he
knelt
and
plucked
a
few
of
them
which
he
laid
cool
and
gleaming
upon
the
seat
by
the
spring
the
flowers
did
not
hold
his
attention
very
long
however
he
rose
up
and
turned
away
towards
where
a
few
steps
beyond
the
open
country
could
be
seen
between
the
tree
trunks
beyond
the
edge
of
the
woods
was
a
field
through
which
the
footpath
and
the
streamlet
both
ran
the
former
to
join
a
road
leading
to
a
little
town
which
lay
in
the
distance
the
landscape
was
beautiful
in
its
morning
freshness
but
it
was
not
that
which
the
young
man
thought
of
he
had
given
but
one
glance
before
he
started
back
with
a
slight
exclamation
his
face
turning
paler
he
stepped
into
the
concealment
of
the
thick
bushes
at
one
side
where
he
stood
gazing
out
motionless
except
for
a
slight
trembling
down
the
road
he
had
seen
a
figure
just
coming
out
of
the
village
it
was
too
far
away
to
be
recognized
but
it
was
a
young
girl
walking
with
a
quick
and
springing
step
and
he
seemed
to
know
who
it
was
she
had
not
gone
very
far
before
she
came
to
a
thick
hedge
which
lined
the
roadside
and
hid
her
from
the
other
view
he
could
not
see
her
again
until
she
came
to
the
place
where
the
streamlet
was
crossed
by
a
bridge
and
where
the
little
path
turned
off
towards
the
forest
in
the
meantime
he
stood
waiting
anxiously
for
when
she
reached
there
he
would
see
her
plainly
for
the
first
time
and
also
know
if
she
were
coming
to
the
spring
she
must
have
stopped
to
look
at
something
for
the
other
had
almost
started
from
his
hiding
place
in
his
eagerness
when
finally
she
swept
past
the
bushes
she
turned
down
the
path
straight
towards
him
and
he
clasped
his
hands
together
in
delight
as
he
gazed
at
her
and
truly
she
was
a
very
vision
of
the
springtime
as
she
passed
down
the
meadows
that
were
gleaming
with
their
first
sprinkling
of
buttercups
she
was
clad
in
a
dress
of
snowy
white
which
the
wind
swept
before
her
as
she
walked
and
it
had
stolen
one
strand
of
her
golden
hair
to
toss
about
and
play
with
she
came
with
all
the
eagerness
and
spring
of
the
brooklet
that
danced
beside
her
her
cheeks
glowing
with
health
and
filled
with
the
laughter
of
the
morning
surely
of
all
the
flowers
of
the
there
is
none
so
fair
as
the
maiden
and
the
young
man
thought
as
he
stood
watching
her
that
in
all
the
world
there
was
no
maiden
so
fair
as
this
she
did
not
see
him
for
her
eyes
were
lifted
to
a
little
bobolink
that
had
come
flying
down
the
wind
one
does
not
hear
the
bobolink
at
his
best
unless
one
goes
to
hear
him
for
sheer
glorified
happiness
there
is
in
all
our
land
no
bird
like
him
at
the
hour
of
sunrise
when
he
is
drunk
with
the
morning
breeze
and
the
sight
of
the
roses
at
present
a
shower
had
just
passed
and
the
bobolink
may
have
thought
that
another
dawn
had
come
or
perhaps
he
saw
the
maiden
at
any
rate
he
perched
himself
upon
the
topmost
leaf
of
the
maple
tree
still
as
if
scorning
even
that
much
support
and
there
he
sang
his
song
first
he
gave
his
long
prelude
that
one
does
not
often
hear
a
few
notes
a
score
of
times
repeated
and
growing
swift
and
loud
and
more
and
more
strenuous
and
insistent
as
sometimes
the
orchestra
builds
up
its
climax
so
that
the
listener
holds
his
breath
and
waits
for
something
he
knows
not
what
then
he
paused
a
moment
and
turned
his
head
to
see
if
the
girl
were
watching
and
filled
his
throat
and
poured
out
his
wonderful
gushing
music
with
its
watery
and
tone
that
only
the
streamlet
can
echo
from
its
secret
places
underneath
the
banks
again
and
again
he
gave
it
forth
the
white
patches
on
his
wings
flashing
in
the
sunlight
and
both
himself
and
his
song
one
thrill
of
joy
the
girl
face
was
lit
up
with
delight
as
she
tripped
down
the
meadow
path
a
gust
of
wind
came
up
behind
her
and
bowed
the
grass
and
the
flowers
before
her
and
swung
the
bird
upon
the
tree
and
so
light
was
the
girl
step
that
it
seemed
to
lift
her
and
sweep
her
onward
as
it
grew
stronger
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
it
and
half
leaned
upon
it
and
flung
her
head
back
for
the
very
fullness
of
her
happiness
the
wind
tossed
her
skirts
about
her
and
stole
another
tress
of
hair
and
swung
the
lily
which
she
had
plucked
and
which
she
carried
in
her
hand
it
is
only
when
one
has
heard
much
music
that
he
understands
the
morning
wind
and
knows
that
it
is
a
living
thing
about
which
he
can
say
such
things
as
that
one
needs
only
to
train
his
ear
and
he
can
hear
its
footsteps
upon
the
meadows
and
hear
it
calling
to
him
from
the
tops
of
the
trees
the
girl
was
the
very
spirit
of
the
wind
at
that
moment
and
she
seemed
to
feel
that
some
music
was
needed
she
glanced
up
again
at
the
bobolink
who
had
ceased
his
song
she
nodded
to
him
once
as
if
for
a
challenge
and
then
still
leaning
back
upon
the
breeze
and
keeping
time
with
the
flower
in
her
hand
she
broke
out
into
a
happy
song
heard
a
streamlet
gushing
from
out
its
rocky
bed
far
down
the
valley
rushing
so
fresh
and
clear
it
but
then
as
if
even
schubert
were
not
equal
to
the
fullness
of
her
heart
or
because
the
language
of
joy
has
no
words
she
left
the
song
unfinished
and
swept
on
in
a
wild
carol
that
rose
and
swelled
and
made
the
forest
echo
the
bobolink
listened
and
then
flew
on
to
listen
again
while
still
the
girl
poured
out
her
breathless
music
a
mad
volley
of
soaring
melody
it
seemed
fairly
to
lift
her
from
her
feet
and
she
was
half
dancing
as
she
went
there
came
another
gust
of
wind
and
took
her
in
its
arms
and
the
streamlet
fled
before
her
and
thus
the
three
in
one
wild
burst
of
happiness
swept
into
the
woodland
together
there
in
its
shadows
the
girl
stopped
short
her
song
cut
in
half
by
the
sight
of
the
old
forest
in
its
majesty
one
could
not
have
imagined
a
greater
contrast
than
the
darkness
and
silence
which
dwelt
beneath
the
vast
canopy
and
she
gazed
about
her
in
rapture
first
at
the
trees
and
then
at
the
royal
carpet
of
green
starred
with
its
fields
of
flowers
her
breast
heaved
and
she
stretched
out
her
arms
as
if
she
would
have
clasped
it
all
to
her
it
is
so
beautiful
she
cried
aloud
is
so
beautiful
in
the
meantime
the
young
man
still
unseen
had
been
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
bushes
drinking
in
the
sight
the
landscape
and
the
figure
and
the
song
had
all
faded
from
his
thoughts
or
rather
blended
themselves
as
a
halo
about
one
thing
the
face
of
this
girl
for
it
was
one
of
those
faces
that
a
man
may
see
once
in
a
lifetime
and
keep
as
a
haunting
memory
ever
afterwards
as
a
vision
of
the
sweetness
and
glory
of
woman
at
this
moment
it
was
a
face
transfigured
with
rapture
and
the
man
who
was
gazing
upon
it
was
trembling
and
scarcely
aware
of
where
he
was
for
fully
a
minute
more
the
girl
stood
motionless
gazing
about
at
the
forest
then
she
chanced
to
look
towards
the
spring
where
she
saw
the
flowers
upon
the
seat
someone
has
left
a
nosegay
she
exclaimed
as
she
started
forward
but
that
seemed
to
suggest
another
thought
to
her
and
she
looked
around
as
she
did
so
she
caught
sight
of
the
young
man
and
sprang
towards
him
arthur
you
here
she
cried
the
other
started
forward
as
if
he
would
have
clasped
her
in
his
arms
but
then
recollecting
himself
he
came
forward
very
slowly
half
lowering
his
eyes
before
the
girl
beauty
you
recollect
me
helen
do
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
was
the
answer
you
dear
foolish
boy
of
course
i
recollect
you
but
how
in
the
world
do
you
come
to
be
here
came
here
to
see
you
see
me
exclaimed
she
pray
how
and
then
she
stopped
and
a
look
of
delight
swept
across
her
face
mean
that
you
knew
i
would
come
here
the
first
thing
do
that
was
beautiful
she
exclaimed
am
so
glad
i
did
the
glance
which
she
gave
made
his
heart
leap
up
for
a
moment
or
two
they
were
silent
looking
at
each
other
and
then
suddenly
another
thought
struck
the
girl
she
cried
forgot
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
come
all
the
way
from
hilltown
just
to
see
me
this
morning
she
received
the
same
answer
again
is
twelve
miles
she
exclaimed
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
you
must
be
tired
to
she
put
out
her
hand
which
he
took
tremblingly
us
go
sit
down
on
the
bench
she
said
then
we
can
talk
about
things
i
am
perfectly
delighted
that
you
came
she
added
when
she
had
seated
herself
with
the
marigolds
and
the
lily
in
her
lap
will
seem
just
like
old
times
just
think
how
long
ago
it
was
that
i
saw
you
last
arthur
three
whole
years
and
do
you
know
as
i
left
the
town
i
thought
of
you
and
that
i
might
find
you
the
young
man
face
flushed
with
pleasure
i
forgotten
you
since
went
on
the
girl
eyeing
him
mischievously
oh
i
was
so
happy
coming
down
the
old
old
path
and
seeing
all
the
old
sights
things
have
changed
a
bit
arthur
the
woods
look
exactly
the
same
and
the
bridge
altered
a
mite
since
the
days
we
used
to
sit
on
the
edge
and
let
our
feet
hang
in
do
you
remember
that
arthur
was
the
answer
that
was
over
a
dozen
years
ago
how
old
are
you
now
arthur
no
and
i
am
just
nineteen
is
my
birthday
you
know
had
not
forgotten
it
came
to
welcome
me
and
so
did
everything
else
do
you
know
i
do
think
i
ever
been
so
happy
in
my
life
as
i
was
just
now
for
i
thought
the
old
trees
greeted
me
and
the
bridge
and
the
stream
and
i
sure
that
was
the
same
bobolink
they
do
have
any
bobolinks
in
germany
and
so
that
one
was
the
first
i
have
heard
in
three
years
you
heard
him
did
you
arthur
did
at
first
said
arthur
then
you
heard
me
you
wicked
boy
you
heard
me
come
in
here
singing
and
talking
to
myself
like
a
mad
creature
i
do
think
i
ever
felt
so
like
singing
before
they
make
hard
work
out
of
singing
and
everything
else
in
germany
you
know
so
i
never
sang
out
of
business
hours
but
i
believe
i
could
sing
all
day
now
because
so
on
said
the
other
seriously
could
i
want
to
talk
to
you
just
now
said
helen
should
have
kept
yourself
hidden
and
then
you
have
heard
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
that
you
never
have
another
chance
to
hear
for
i
was
just
going
to
make
a
speech
to
the
forest
and
i
think
i
should
have
kissed
each
one
of
the
flowers
you
might
have
put
it
all
into
a
poem
for
oh
father
tells
me
you
going
to
be
a
great
poet
going
to
try
said
arthur
blushing
think
how
romantic
that
would
be
the
girl
laughed
i
could
write
your
memoir
and
tell
all
i
knew
about
you
tell
me
about
yourself
arthur
i
do
mean
for
the
memoir
but
because
i
want
to
know
the
is
any
helen
except
that
i
finished
college
last
spring
as
i
wrote
you
and
i
teaching
school
at
you
like
it
hate
it
but
i
have
to
keep
alive
to
try
to
be
a
poet
and
that
is
the
news
about
added
helen
you
walked
twelve
miles
this
glorious
saturday
morning
to
welcome
me
home
which
was
beautiful
and
of
course
you
stay
over
sunday
now
you
here
i
can
invite
you
myself
you
know
for
i
come
home
to
take
the
reins
of
government
you
never
saw
such
a
sight
in
your
life
as
my
poor
father
has
made
of
our
house
he
got
the
parlor
all
full
of
those
horrible
theological
works
of
his
just
as
if
god
had
never
made
anything
beautiful
and
since
i
been
away
that
dreadful
dale
has
gotten
complete
charge
of
the
church
and
she
one
of
those
creatures
that
would
allow
you
to
burn
a
candle
in
the
organ
loft
and
father
never
was
of
any
use
for
quarreling
about
helen
father
the
reverend
austin
davis
was
the
rector
of
the
little
episcopal
church
in
the
town
of
oakdale
just
across
the
fields
only
arrived
last
night
the
girl
prattled
on
venting
her
happiness
in
that
way
instead
of
singing
i
hunted
up
two
tallow
candles
in
the
attic
and
you
shall
see
them
in
church
if
there
any
complaint
about
the
smell
i
tell
dale
we
ought
to
have
incense
and
she
get
so
excited
about
that
that
i
carry
the
candles
by
default
i
going
to
institute
other
reforms
also
i
going
to
make
the
choir
sing
in
tune
you
will
only
sing
as
you
were
singing
just
now
nobody
will
hear
the
rest
of
the
choir
vowed
the
young
man
who
during
her
remarks
had
never
taken
his
eyes
off
the
girl
radiant
face
helen
seemed
not
to
notice
it
for
she
had
been
arranging
the
marigolds
now
she
was
drying
them
with
her
handkerchief
before
fastening
them
upon
her
dress
ought
to
learn
to
sing
yourself
she
said
while
she
bent
her
head
down
at
that
task
you
care
for
music
any
more
than
you
used
to
think
i
shall
care
for
it
just
as
i
did
then
was
the
answer
you
sing
said
helen
looking
up
from
her
marigolds
idea
of
a
dumb
poet
anyway
a
man
who
can
not
sing
his
own
songs
do
you
know
that
if
you
could
sing
and
make
yourself
gloriously
happy
as
i
was
just
now
and
as
i
mean
to
be
some
more
you
could
write
poetry
whenever
you
can
believe
that
said
arthur
why
have
you
ever
learned
our
english
poets
have
all
been
ridiculous
creatures
about
music
any
how
i
do
believe
there
was
one
in
this
century
except
browning
that
really
knew
anything
about
it
and
all
their
groaning
and
pining
for
inspiration
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
need
of
some
music
i
was
reading
the
of
art
only
the
other
day
and
there
was
that
pleasure
house
with
all
its
modern
improvements
and
without
a
sound
of
music
of
course
the
poor
soul
had
to
go
back
to
the
suffering
world
if
it
were
only
to
hear
a
is
certainly
a
novel
theory
admitted
the
young
poet
shall
come
to
you
when
i
need
and
bring
me
your
songs
added
the
girl
i
will
sing
them
to
you
you
can
write
me
a
poem
about
that
brook
for
one
thing
i
was
thinking
just
as
i
came
down
the
road
that
if
i
were
a
poet
i
should
have
beautiful
things
to
say
to
that
brook
will
you
do
it
for
me
have
already
tried
to
write
one
said
the
young
man
hesitatingly
song
asked
helen
good
and
i
shall
make
some
music
for
it
will
you
tell
it
to
me
if
you
can
remember
it
said
helen
you
you
wish
it
said
arthur
simply
wrote
it
two
or
three
months
ago
when
the
country
was
different
from
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
some
papers
and
then
in
a
low
tone
he
read
these
words
to
the
girl
at
midnight
the
burden
of
the
winter
the
year
haa
borne
too
long
and
oh
my
heart
is
weary
for
a
springtime
song
the
moonbeams
shrink
unwelcomed
from
the
frozen
lake
of
all
the
forest
voices
there
is
but
one
awake
i
seek
thee
happy
streamlet
that
murmurest
on
thy
way
as
a
child
in
troubled
slumber
still
dreaming
of
its
play
i
ask
thee
where
in
thy
journey
thou
seeest
so
fair
a
sight
that
thou
hast
joy
and
singing
all
through
the
winter
night
helen
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
then
she
said
think
that
is
beautiful
arthur
but
it
is
not
what
i
not
he
asked
should
have
liked
it
when
you
wrote
it
but
now
the
spring
has
come
and
we
must
be
happy
you
have
heard
the
springtime
said
arthur
the
streamlet
has
led
me
to
the
beautiful
beautiful
said
helen
gazing
about
her
with
that
naive
unconsciousness
which
wise
man
son
doth
is
one
thing
he
may
never
trust
in
a
woman
could
not
be
more
beautiful
she
added
you
must
write
me
something
about
it
instead
of
wandering
around
our
on
winter
nights
till
your
imagination
turns
it
into
a
frozen
the
young
poet
put
away
his
papers
rather
suddenly
at
that
and
helen
after
gazing
at
him
for
a
moment
and
laughing
to
herself
sprang
up
from
the
seat
she
cried
are
we
sitting
here
anyway
talking
about
all
sorts
of
things
and
forgetting
the
springtime
altogether
i
have
been
half
as
happy
yet
as
i
mean
to
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
friend
twelve
mile
walk
but
he
had
forgotten
it
too
just
as
he
soon
forgot
the
rather
wintry
reception
of
his
little
song
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
remain
dull
very
long
in
the
presence
of
the
girl
glowing
energy
for
once
upon
her
feet
helen
dancing
mood
seemed
to
come
back
to
her
if
indeed
it
had
ever
more
than
half
left
her
the
brooklet
struck
up
the
measure
again
and
the
wind
shook
the
trees
far
above
them
to
tell
that
it
was
still
awake
and
the
girl
was
the
very
spirit
of
the
springtime
once
more
arthur
she
said
as
she
led
him
down
the
path
think
how
happy
i
ought
to
be
to
welcome
all
the
old
things
after
so
long
and
to
find
them
all
so
beautiful
it
is
just
as
if
the
country
had
put
on
its
finest
dress
to
give
me
greeting
and
i
feel
as
if
i
were
not
half
gay
enough
in
return
just
think
what
this
springtime
is
how
all
over
the
country
everything
is
growing
and
rejoicing
is
what
i
want
you
to
put
into
the
poem
for
and
so
she
led
him
on
into
the
forest
carried
on
by
joy
herself
and
taking
all
things
into
her
song
she
did
not
notice
that
the
young
man
forehead
was
flushed
or
that
his
hand
was
burning
when
she
took
it
in
hers
as
they
walked
if
she
noticed
it
she
chose
at
any
rate
to
pretend
not
to
she
sang
to
him
about
the
forest
and
the
flowers
and
some
more
of
the
merry
song
which
she
had
sung
before
then
she
stopped
to
shake
her
head
at
a
saucy
adder
tongue
that
thrust
its
yellow
face
up
through
the
dead
leaves
at
her
feet
and
to
ask
that
of
all
flowers
what
secrets
it
knew
about
the
later
on
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
brook
fled
faster
sparkling
brightly
in
the
sunlight
over
its
shallow
bed
of
pebbles
it
was
only
her
runaway
caroling
that
could
keep
pace
with
that
and
so
her
glee
mounted
higher
the
young
man
at
her
side
half
in
a
trance
watching
her
laughing
face
and
drinking
in
the
sound
of
her
voice
how
long
that
might
have
lasted
there
is
no
telling
had
it
not
been
that
the
woods
came
to
an
end
disclosing
more
open
fields
and
a
village
beyond
better
not
go
any
farther
said
helen
laughing
any
of
the
earth
creatures
should
hear
us
carrying
on
they
would
not
know
it
was
ohne
wein
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
her
companion
and
led
him
to
a
seat
upon
a
fallen
log
nearby
boy
she
said
forgot
that
you
were
supposed
to
be
does
not
make
any
difference
was
the
reply
had
thought
of
no
need
to
walk
farther
said
helen
i
seen
all
that
i
wish
to
see
how
dear
this
walk
ought
to
be
to
us
arthur
do
not
know
about
you
helen
said
the
young
man
it
has
been
dear
to
me
indeed
i
could
not
tell
you
how
many
times
i
have
walked
over
it
all
alone
since
you
left
and
i
used
to
think
about
the
many
times
i
had
walked
it
with
you
you
have
forgotten
helen
have
you
said
helen
one
the
young
man
was
resting
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
gazing
steadily
at
the
girl
you
remember
helen
he
stopped
and
she
turned
with
her
bright
clear
eyes
and
gazed
into
his
what
she
asked
you
remember
the
last
time
we
took
it
helen
she
flushed
a
trifle
and
half
involuntarily
turned
her
glance
away
again
you
remember
he
asked
again
seeing
that
she
was
silent
i
remember
said
the
girl
her
voice
lower
i
rather
you
did
not
she
stopped
short
wish
to
forget
it
helen
asked
arthur
he
was
trembling
with
anxiety
and
his
hands
which
were
clasped
about
his
knee
were
twitching
helen
how
can
you
he
went
on
his
voice
breaking
you
not
remember
the
last
night
that
we
sat
there
by
the
spring
and
you
were
going
away
no
one
knew
for
how
long
and
how
you
told
me
that
it
was
more
than
you
could
bear
and
the
promise
that
you
made
me
oh
helen
the
girl
gazed
at
him
with
a
frightened
look
he
had
sunk
down
upon
his
knee
before
her
and
he
caught
her
hand
which
lay
upon
the
log
at
her
side
he
cried
can
not
mean
to
forget
that
for
that
promise
has
been
the
one
joy
of
my
life
that
for
which
i
have
labored
so
hard
my
one
hope
helen
i
came
to
claim
it
to
tell
you
and
with
a
wild
glance
about
her
the
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
snatching
her
hand
away
from
his
she
cried
you
must
not
speak
to
me
so
must
not
helen
no
she
cried
trembling
were
only
children
and
we
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
words
we
used
you
must
not
talk
to
me
that
way
he
protested
helplessly
no
i
will
not
allow
it
she
cried
more
vehemently
stepping
back
as
he
started
towards
her
and
holding
close
to
her
the
hand
he
had
held
had
no
idea
there
was
such
a
thought
in
your
mind
helen
stopped
breathlessly
or
you
would
not
have
been
so
kind
to
me
the
other
added
faintly
thought
of
you
as
an
old
friend
said
helen
was
but
a
child
when
i
went
away
i
wish
you
still
to
be
a
friend
arthur
but
you
must
not
act
in
that
the
young
man
glanced
once
at
her
and
when
he
saw
the
stern
look
upon
her
face
he
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
without
a
sound
for
fully
a
minute
they
remained
thus
in
silence
then
as
helen
watched
him
her
chest
ceased
gradually
to
heave
and
a
gentler
look
returned
to
her
face
she
came
and
sat
down
on
the
log
again
she
said
after
another
silence
we
not
just
be
friends
the
young
man
answered
nothing
but
he
raised
his
head
and
gazed
at
her
and
she
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
and
a
look
of
mute
helplessness
upon
his
face
she
trembled
slightly
and
rose
to
her
feet
again
she
said
gravely
must
not
be
we
must
not
sit
here
any
longer
i
must
exclaimed
the
other
springing
up
but
he
saw
her
brow
knit
again
and
he
stopped
short
the
girl
gazed
about
her
and
the
village
in
the
distance
caught
her
eye
she
said
with
forced
calmness
promised
father
that
i
would
go
and
see
old
woodward
who
was
asking
for
me
you
may
wait
here
if
you
like
and
walk
home
with
me
for
i
shall
not
be
gone
very
long
will
you
do
it
the
other
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
or
two
he
was
trying
to
read
the
girl
heart
but
he
saw
only
the
quiet
firmness
of
her
features
you
wait
arthur
she
asked
again
and
arthur
head
sank
upon
his
breast
helen
he
said
when
he
lifted
it
again
the
girl
was
gone
she
had
disappeared
in
the
thicket
and
he
could
hear
her
footsteps
as
she
passed
swiftly
down
the
hillside
he
went
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
where
he
could
see
her
a
short
distance
below
hurrying
down
the
path
with
a
step
as
light
and
free
as
ever
the
wind
had
met
her
at
the
forest
edge
and
joined
her
once
more
playing
about
her
skirts
and
tossing
the
lily
again
as
arthur
watched
her
the
old
music
came
back
into
his
heart
his
eyes
sparkled
and
all
his
soul
seemed
to
be
dancing
in
time
with
her
light
motion
thus
it
went
until
she
came
to
a
place
where
the
path
must
hide
her
from
his
view
the
young
man
held
his
breath
and
when
she
turned
a
cry
of
joy
escaped
him
she
saw
him
and
waved
her
hand
to
him
gaily
as
she
swept
on
out
of
his
sight
for
a
moment
afterwards
he
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
then
whirled
about
and
laughed
aloud
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
which
was
flushed
and
hot
and
he
gazed
about
him
as
if
he
were
not
sure
where
he
was
she
is
so
beautiful
he
cried
his
face
a
picture
of
rapture
beautiful
and
he
started
through
the
forest
as
wildly
as
any
madman
now
muttering
to
himself
and
now
laughing
aloud
and
making
the
forest
echo
with
helen
name
when
he
stopped
again
he
was
far
away
from
the
path
in
a
desolate
spot
but
tho
he
was
staring
around
him
he
saw
no
more
than
before
trembling
had
seized
his
limbs
and
he
sank
down
upon
the
yellow
forest
leaves
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
and
whispering
if
i
should
lose
her
if
i
should
lose
her
as
old
polonius
has
it
truly
it
was
very
ecstasy
of
chapter
ii
dancing
shape
an
image
gay
to
haunt
to
startle
and
the
town
of
oakdale
is
at
the
present
time
a
flourishing
place
inhabited
principally
by
for
it
lies
not
very
far
from
new
york
but
the
reverend
austin
davis
who
was
the
spiritual
guardian
of
most
of
them
had
come
to
oakdale
some
twenty
and
more
years
ago
when
it
was
only
a
little
village
with
a
struggling
church
which
it
was
the
task
of
the
young
clergyman
to
keep
alive
perhaps
the
growth
of
the
town
had
as
much
to
do
with
his
success
as
his
own
efforts
but
however
that
might
have
been
he
had
received
his
temporal
reward
some
ten
years
later
in
the
shape
of
a
fine
stone
church
with
a
little
parsonage
beside
it
he
had
lived
there
ever
since
alone
with
his
one
child
for
just
after
coming
to
oakdale
he
had
married
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
wealthy
families
of
the
neighborhood
and
been
left
a
widower
a
year
or
two
later
a
more
unromantic
and
thoroughly
busy
man
than
davis
at
the
age
of
when
this
story
begins
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
find
but
nevertheless
people
spoke
of
no
less
than
two
romances
that
had
been
connected
with
his
life
one
of
them
had
been
his
early
marriage
which
had
created
a
mild
sensation
while
the
other
had
come
into
his
life
even
sooner
in
fact
on
the
very
first
day
of
his
arrival
at
oakdale
davis
could
still
bring
back
to
his
mind
with
perfect
clearness
the
first
night
he
had
spent
in
the
little
wooden
cottage
which
he
had
hired
for
his
residence
how
while
busily
unpacking
his
trunk
and
trying
to
bring
the
disordered
place
into
shape
he
had
opened
the
door
in
answer
to
a
knock
and
beheld
a
woman
stagger
in
out
of
the
storm
she
was
a
young
girl
surely
not
yet
out
of
her
teens
her
pale
and
sunken
face
showing
marks
of
refinement
and
of
former
beauty
she
carried
in
her
arms
a
child
of
about
a
year
age
and
she
dropped
it
upon
the
sofa
and
sank
down
beside
it
half
fainting
from
exhaustion
the
young
clergyman
anxious
inquiries
having
succeeded
in
eliciting
but
incoherent
replies
he
had
left
the
room
to
procure
some
nourishment
for
the
exhausted
woman
it
was
upon
his
return
that
the
discovery
of
the
romance
alluded
to
was
made
for
the
woman
had
disappeared
in
the
darkness
and
storm
and
the
baby
was
still
lying
upon
the
sofa
it
was
not
altogether
a
pleasant
romance
as
is
probably
the
case
with
a
good
many
romances
in
reality
davis
was
destined
to
retain
for
a
long
time
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
first
night
which
he
spent
in
alternately
feeding
that
baby
with
a
spoon
and
in
walking
the
floor
with
it
and
also
to
remember
the
sly
glances
which
his
parishioners
only
half
hid
from
him
when
his
unpleasant
plight
was
made
known
it
happened
that
the
poorhouse
at
hilltown
near
by
to
which
the
infant
would
have
gone
if
he
had
left
it
to
the
care
of
the
county
was
at
that
time
being
with
all
that
the
name
implies
when
referring
to
public
matters
the
clergy
of
the
neighborhood
being
active
in
pushing
the
charges
davis
felt
that
at
present
it
would
look
best
for
him
to
provide
for
the
child
himself
as
the
investigation
came
to
nothing
the
inducement
was
made
a
permanent
one
perhaps
also
the
memory
of
the
mother
wan
face
had
something
to
do
with
the
matter
at
any
rate
the
young
clergyman
tho
but
scantily
provided
for
himself
managed
to
spare
enough
to
engage
a
woman
in
the
town
to
take
care
of
the
young
charge
subsequently
when
davis
wife
died
the
woman
became
helen
nurse
and
so
it
was
that
arthur
as
the
baby
boy
had
been
christened
became
permanently
adopted
into
the
clergyman
little
family
it
had
not
been
possible
to
keep
from
arthur
the
secret
of
his
parentage
and
the
fact
that
it
was
known
to
all
served
to
keep
him
aloof
from
the
other
children
of
the
town
and
to
drive
him
still
more
to
the
confidence
of
helen
one
of
the
phrases
which
davis
had
caught
from
the
mother
lips
had
been
that
the
boy
was
a
son
and
helen
was
wont
to
solace
him
by
that
reminder
perhaps
the
phrase
constantly
repeated
had
much
to
do
with
the
proud
sensitiveness
and
the
resolute
independence
which
soon
manifested
itself
in
the
lad
character
he
had
scarcely
passed
the
age
of
twelve
before
tho
treated
by
davis
with
the
love
and
kindness
of
a
father
he
astonished
the
good
man
by
declaring
that
he
was
old
enough
to
take
care
of
himself
and
tho
davis
was
better
situated
financially
by
that
time
nothing
that
he
could
say
could
alter
the
boy
quiet
determination
to
leave
school
and
be
independent
a
resolution
in
which
he
was
seconded
by
helen
a
little
miss
of
some
nine
years
the
two
children
had
talked
it
over
for
months
as
it
appeared
and
concluded
that
it
was
best
to
sacrifice
in
the
cause
of
honor
the
privilege
of
going
to
school
together
and
of
spending
the
long
holidays
roaming
about
the
country
so
the
lad
had
served
with
childish
dignity
first
as
an
errand
boy
and
then
as
a
store
clerk
always
contributing
his
mite
of
to
davis
household
expenses
meanwhile
possibly
because
he
was
really
gentleman
son
and
had
inherited
a
taste
for
study
he
had
made
by
himself
about
as
much
progress
as
if
he
had
been
at
school
some
years
later
to
the
delight
of
helen
and
davis
he
had
carried
off
a
prize
scholarship
above
the
heads
of
the
graduates
of
the
hilltown
high
school
and
still
refusing
all
help
had
gone
away
to
college
to
support
himself
there
while
studying
by
such
work
as
he
could
find
knowing
well
that
a
true
gentleman
son
is
ashamed
of
nothing
honest
he
spent
his
vacations
at
home
where
he
and
helen
studied
together
or
such
rather
had
been
his
hope
it
was
realized
only
for
the
first
year
helen
had
an
aunt
upon
her
mother
side
a
woman
of
wealth
and
social
position
who
owned
a
large
country
home
near
oakdale
and
who
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
view
with
the
complacency
of
davis
the
idyllic
friendship
of
the
two
young
people
roberts
or
as
she
was
known
to
the
family
had
plans
of
her
own
concerning
the
future
of
the
beauty
which
she
saw
unfolding
itself
at
the
oakdale
parsonage
she
said
nothing
to
davis
for
he
being
busy
with
theological
works
and
charitable
organizations
was
not
considered
a
man
from
whom
one
might
hope
for
proper
ideas
about
life
but
with
her
own
more
practical
husband
she
had
frequently
discussed
the
danger
and
the
possible
methods
of
warding
it
off
to
send
helen
to
a
boarding
school
would
have
been
of
no
use
for
the
vacations
were
the
times
of
danger
so
it
was
that
the
trip
abroad
was
finally
decided
upon
aunt
polly
having
traveled
herself
had
a
wholesome
regard
for
german
culture
believing
that
music
and
things
of
that
sort
were
paying
investments
it
chanced
also
that
her
own
eldest
daughter
who
was
a
year
older
than
helen
was
about
through
with
all
that
american
teachers
had
to
impart
and
so
after
much
argument
with
davis
it
was
finally
arranged
that
she
and
helen
should
study
in
germany
together
just
when
poor
arthur
was
returning
home
with
the
sublime
title
of
junior
his
dream
of
all
things
divine
was
carried
off
by
aunt
polly
and
after
a
summer
spent
in
europe
was
installed
in
a
girl
school
in
leipzig
and
now
three
years
having
passed
helen
has
left
her
cousin
for
another
year
of
travel
and
returned
home
in
all
the
glory
of
her
own
springtime
and
of
nature
which
brings
us
to
where
we
left
her
hurrying
away
to
pay
a
duty
call
in
the
little
settlement
on
the
hillside
the
visit
had
not
been
entirely
a
subterfuge
for
helen
father
had
mentioned
to
her
that
the
elderly
person
whom
she
had
named
to
arthur
was
expecting
to
see
her
when
she
returned
and
helen
had
been
troubled
by
the
thought
that
she
would
never
have
any
peace
until
she
had
paid
that
visit
it
was
by
no
means
an
agreeable
one
for
old
woodward
was
exceedingly
dull
and
helen
felt
that
she
was
called
upon
to
make
war
upon
dullness
however
it
had
occurred
to
her
to
get
her
task
out
of
the
way
at
once
while
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
leave
arthur
the
visit
proved
to
be
quite
as
depressing
as
she
had
expected
for
it
is
sad
to
have
to
record
that
helen
however
sensitive
to
the
streamlet
and
the
flowers
had
not
the
least
sympathy
in
the
world
for
an
old
woman
who
had
a
very
sharp
chin
who
stared
at
one
through
two
pairs
of
spectacles
and
whose
conversation
was
about
her
own
health
and
the
dampness
of
the
springtime
besides
the
dreariest
gossip
about
oakdale
least
interesting
people
perhaps
it
might
have
occurred
to
the
girl
that
it
is
very
forlorn
to
have
nothing
else
to
talk
about
and
that
even
old
woodward
might
have
liked
to
hear
about
some
of
the
things
in
the
forest
or
to
have
been
offered
the
lily
and
the
marigold
unfortunately
however
helen
did
not
think
about
any
of
that
but
only
moved
restlessly
about
in
her
chair
and
gazed
around
the
ugly
room
finally
when
she
could
stand
it
no
more
she
sprang
up
between
two
of
longest
sentences
and
remarked
that
it
was
very
late
and
a
long
way
home
and
that
she
would
come
again
some
time
then
at
last
when
she
was
out
in
the
open
air
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
fled
away
to
the
woods
wondering
what
could
be
reason
for
such
things
it
was
not
until
she
was
half
way
up
the
hillside
that
she
could
feel
that
the
wind
which
blew
now
upon
her
forehead
had
quite
swept
away
the
depression
which
had
settled
upon
her
she
drank
in
the
odors
which
blew
from
the
woods
and
began
singing
to
herself
again
and
looking
out
for
arthur
she
was
rather
surprised
not
to
see
him
at
once
and
still
more
surprised
when
she
came
nearer
and
raised
her
voice
to
call
him
for
she
reached
the
forest
and
came
to
the
place
where
she
had
left
him
without
a
reply
having
come
she
shouted
his
name
again
and
again
until
at
last
not
without
a
half
secret
chagrin
to
have
been
so
quickly
forgotten
she
was
obliged
to
set
out
for
home
alone
he
gone
on
ahead
she
thought
quickening
her
pace
for
a
time
she
watched
anxiously
expecting
to
see
his
darkly
clad
figure
but
she
soon
wearied
of
continued
failure
and
because
it
was
her
birthday
and
because
the
brook
was
still
at
her
side
and
the
beautiful
forest
still
about
her
she
took
to
singing
again
and
was
quickly
as
happy
and
glorious
as
before
ceasing
her
caroling
and
moderating
her
woodland
pace
only
when
she
neared
the
town
she
passed
down
the
main
street
of
oakdale
not
quite
without
an
exulting
consciousness
that
her
walk
had
crowned
her
beauty
and
that
no
one
whom
she
saw
was
thinking
about
anything
else
and
so
she
came
to
her
home
to
the
dear
old
parsonage
with
its
spreading
ivy
vines
and
its
two
great
elms
when
she
had
hurried
up
the
steps
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
helen
felt
privileged
again
to
be
just
as
merry
as
she
chose
for
she
was
even
more
at
home
here
than
in
the
woods
it
seemed
as
if
everything
were
stretching
out
its
arms
to
her
to
welcome
her
and
to
invite
her
to
carry
out
her
declared
purpose
of
taking
the
reins
of
government
in
her
own
hands
upon
one
side
of
the
hallway
was
a
parlor
and
on
the
other
side
two
rooms
which
davis
had
used
as
a
reception
room
and
a
study
the
parlor
had
never
been
opened
and
helen
promised
herself
a
jolly
time
superintending
the
fixing
up
of
that
on
the
other
side
she
had
already
taken
possession
of
the
front
room
symbolically
at
any
rate
by
having
her
piano
moved
in
and
her
music
unpacked
and
a
case
emptied
for
the
books
she
had
brought
from
germany
to
be
sure
on
the
other
side
was
still
a
dreary
wall
of
theological
treatises
in
funereal
black
but
helen
was
not
without
hopes
that
continued
doses
of
cheerfulness
might
cure
her
father
of
such
incomprehensible
habits
and
obtain
for
her
the
permission
to
move
the
books
to
the
attic
to
start
things
in
that
direction
the
girl
now
danced
gaily
into
the
study
where
her
father
was
in
the
act
of
writing
brethren
for
his
next
day
sermon
and
crying
out
merrily
up
my
friend
and
quit
your
books
or
surely
you
grow
double
she
saluted
her
reverend
father
with
the
sweetest
of
kisses
and
then
seated
herself
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
gravely
took
his
pen
out
of
his
hand
and
closed
his
inkstand
she
turned
over
the
brethren
without
blotting
it
and
recited
solemnly
impulse
from
a
vernal
wood
may
teach
you
more
of
man
of
moral
evil
and
of
good
than
all
the
sages
can
and
then
she
laughed
the
merriest
of
merry
laughs
and
added
dear
i
am
an
impulse
and
i
want
you
to
spare
some
time
for
my
love
said
davis
smiling
upon
her
though
groaning
inwardly
for
his
lost
ideas
are
beautiful
this
morning
helen
what
have
you
been
doing
had
a
glorious
walk
replied
the
girl
all
kinds
of
wonderful
adventures
i
had
a
dance
with
the
morning
wind
and
a
race
of
a
mile
or
two
with
a
brook
and
i
sung
duets
with
all
the
flowers
and
here
you
are
writing
uninteresting
things
my
sermon
helen
said
davis
know
it
said
helen
gravely
it
must
be
done
for
protested
the
other
your
congregation
is
going
to
be
so
excited
about
two
tallow
candles
that
it
wo
know
what
you
preach
about
answered
the
girl
swinging
herself
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
i
going
to
sing
for
the
other
half
and
so
they
wo
care
either
and
besides
daddy
i
got
news
to
tell
you
you
no
idea
what
a
good
girl
i
my
love
went
to
see
did
and
it
was
just
to
show
you
how
dutiful
i
going
to
be
daddy
i
felt
so
sorry
for
the
poor
old
lady
it
is
so
beautiful
to
know
that
one
is
doing
good
and
bringing
happiness
into
other
people
lives
i
think
i
go
and
see
her
often
and
carry
her
something
nice
if
you
let
helen
said
all
that
as
gravely
as
a
judge
but
davis
was
agreeing
so
delightedly
that
she
feared
she
was
carrying
the
joke
too
far
she
changed
the
subject
quickly
daddy
she
cried
forgot
to
tell
you
i
met
a
genius
genius
inquired
the
other
said
helen
i
been
walking
around

davis
i
do
understand
your
was
the
genius
of
hilltown
high
school
laughed
helen
arthur
will
you
believe
it
the
dear
boy
had
walked
all
the
way
from
there
to
see
me
and
he
waited
out
by
the
old
seat
at
the
spring
where
is
he
now
do
know
said
helen
very
queer
i
left
him
to
go

woodward
he
did
go
with
me
she
added
do

inclined

arthur

the
other

helen
demurely
going
to
be
a

said
davis
dubiously
i
know
you
make
blots
when
i
come
to
the
cymbals
said
helen
and
she
doubled
up
her
fists
and
hummed
the
passage
and
gave
so
realistic
an
imitation
of
the
in
the
great
dirge
that
it
almost
upset
the
chair
afterwards
she
laughed
one
of
her
merriest
laughs
and
kissed
her
father
on
the
forehead
heard
it
at
baireuth
she
said
it
was
just
fine
it
made
your
flesh
creep
all
over
you
and
oh
daddy
i
brought
home
a
souvenir
of
wagner
grave
you
asked
davis
who
knew
very
little
about
wagner
said
helen
a
pebble
i
picked
up
near
it
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
officer
at
the
dock
yesterday
when
he
was
going
through
my
trunks
this
miss
he
asked
i
guess
he
thought
it
was
a
diamond
in
the
rough
that
from
grave
i
said
and
what
do
you
think
the
wretch
did
sure
i
do
know
my
threw
it
back
saying
it
was
worth
anything
i
think
he
must
have
been
a
took
the
longest
time
going
through
all
my
treasures
helen
prattled
on
after
laughing
at
her
own
joke
know
aunt
polly
let
us
have
everything
we
wanted
bless
her
heart
afraid
aunt
polly
must
have
spoiled
you
said
the
other
has
laughed
helen
really
think
she
must
mean
to
make
me
marry
a
rich
husband
or
else
she
never
have
left
me
at
that
great
rich
school
lucy
and
i
were
the
you
know
and
we
just
had
everybody
to
spoil
us
how
in
the
world
could
you
ever
manage
to
spare
so
much
money
daddy
it
was
not
so
much
said
davis
are
cheaper
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
grimly
resolute
aunt
polly
had
paid
of
her
niece
expenses
secretly
besides
distributing
pocket
money
with
lavish
generosity
you
should
see
the
wonderful
dresses
i
brought
from
paris
helen
went
on
daddy
i
tell
you
i
shall
be
glorious
aunt
polly
going
to
invite
a
lot
of
people
at
her
house
next
week
to
meet
me
and
i
going
to
wear
the
reddest
of
red
red
dresses
and
just
shine
like
a
lighthouse
afraid
said
the
clergyman
surveying
her
with
more
pride
than
was
perhaps
orthodox
afraid
you
find
it
hard
to
be
satisfied
in
this
poor
little
home
of
that
all
right
said
helen
soon
get
used
to
it
and
besides
i
got
plenty
of
things
to
fix
it
up
with
if
you
only
get
those
dreadful
theological
works
out
of
the
front
room
daddy
dear
you
ca
imagine
how
hard
it
is
to
bring
the
valkyries
and
niebelungs
into
a
theological
see
what
i
can
do
my
love
said
davis
he
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
perhaps
wondering
vaguely
whether
it
was
well
that
this
commanding
young
lady
should
have
everything
in
the
world
she
desired
helen
who
had
her
share
of
penetration
probably
divined
the
thought
for
she
made
haste
to
change
the
subject
the
way
she
laughed
got
so
interested
in
our
chattering
that
we
forgot
all
about
enough
exclaimed
the
other
where
can
he
have
gone
do
know
helen
said
strange
but
poets
are
such
queer
creatures
is
a
very
splendid
creature
said
davis
have
no
idea
helen
how
hard
he
has
labored
since
you
have
been
away
he
carried
off
all
the
honors
at
college
and
they
say
he
has
written
some
good
poetry
i
do
know
much
about
that
but
the
people
who
know
tell
me
would
be
gloriously
romantic
to
know
a
great
poet
said
helen
perhaps
have
him
write
poetry
about
you
thy
beauty
is
to
me
and
helen
make
me
immortal
with
a
kiss
and
all
sorts
of
things
like
that
he
coming
to
live
with
us
this
summer
as
usual
is
he
daddy
do
know
said
the
other
presume
he
will
but
where
can
he
have
gone
acted
very
queerly
said
the
girl
and
then
suddenly
a
delighted
smile
lit
up
her
face
daddy
she
added
you
know
i
think
arthur
is
in
love
love
gasped
davis
in
love
with
whom
sure
i
ca
imagine
said
helen
gravely
he
seemed
so
abstracted
and
he
seemed
to
have
something
to
tell
me
and
then
he
ran
away
is
very
strange
indeed
remarked
the
other
shall
have
to
speak
to
him
about
he
does
come
back
soon
i
go
to
look
for
him
said
the
girl
not
going
to
let
the
water
nixies
run
off
with
my
arthur
there
are
such
things
in
that
stream
because
the
song
i
was
singing
about
it
says
and
then
she
chanted
as
merrily
as
ever
speak
i
of
a
murmur
no
murmur
can
it
be
the
nixies
they
are
singing
the
wave
their
melody
will
tell
you
what
said
davis
rising
from
his
chair
as
he
realized
that
the
sermon
had
entirely
vanished
for
the
present
may
go
part
of
the
way
with
me
and
we
stop
in
to
see
the
vails
gasped
helen
vail
was
the
village
dairyman
whose
farm
lay
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
the
village
dairyman
family
was
not
one
that
helen
cared
to
visit
love
said
davis
vail
has
been
very
ill
and
she
has
three
little
children
you
know
you
told
me
that
you
liked
to
bring
joy
wherever
you
but
daddy
protested
helen
children
are
ugh
i
saw
them
as
i
came
love
answered
the
other
are
god
children
none
the
less
and
we
can
not
always
help
such
we
daddy
there
is
plenty
of
water
in
the
of
course
but
when
the
mother
is
ill
and
the
father
in
trouble
for
poor
vail
has
had
no
end
of
misfortune
he
has
no
resource
but
the
little
dairy
and
three
of
his
cows
have
been
ill
this
and
helen
incorrigible
mirth
lighted
up
her
face
again
she
cried
it
i
saw
him
struggling
away
at
the
pump
as
i
came
by
but
i
had
no
idea
it
was
anything
so
serious
davis
looked
grieved
helen
when
her
first
burst
of
glee
had
passed
noticed
it
and
changed
her
mood
she
put
her
arms
around
her
father
neck
and
pressed
her
cheek
against
his
dear
she
said
coaxingly
i
done
charity
enough
for
one
day
you
will
surfeit
me
at
the
start
and
then
i
be
just
as
little
fond
of
it
as
i
was
before
when
i
must
let
dirty
children
climb
all
over
me
i
can
dress
for
the
dear
pleaded
davis
is
placed
before
admitted
helen
of
course
it
is
right
for
you
to
inculcate
the
greater
virtue
but
i
only
a
girl
and
you
expect
sublimity
from
me
you
do
want
to
turn
me
into
a
president
of
sewing
societies
like
that
dreadful
dale
protested
the
other
helplessly
wish
you
would
not
always
refer
to
dale
with
that
adjective
she
is
the
best
helper
i
daddy
said
helen
with
the
utmost
solemnity
i
have
a
dreadful
eagle
nose
like
hers
perhaps
i
can
preside
over
meetings
too
but
i
ca
do
not
want
you
to
my
love
but
if
i
have
to
cling
by
the
weaker
virtue
of
cleanliness
just
for
a
little
while
daddy
you
must
not
mind
i
visit
all
your
clean
parishioners
for
you
parishioners
like
aunt
polly
and
before
davis
could
make
another
remark
the
girl
had
skipped
into
the
other
room
to
the
piano
as
her
father
went
slowly
out
the
door
the
echoes
of
the
old
house
were
laughing
with
the
happy
melody
of
purcell
nymphs
and
shepherds
come
come
nymphs
and
shepherds
come
come
come
come
come
come
chapter
iii
you
alone
i
strive
to
sing
oh
tell
me
how
to
woo
when
helen
was
left
alone
she
seated
herself
before
her
old
music
stand
which
had
been
brought
down
to
welcome
her
and
proceeded
to
glance
over
and
arrange
the
pieces
she
had
learned
and
loved
in
her
young
girlhood
most
of
them
made
her
smile
and
when
she
reflected
upon
how
difficult
she
used
to
think
them
she
realized
that
now
that
it
was
over
she
was
glad
for
the
german
regime
helen
had
accounted
herself
an
accomplished
pianist
when
she
went
away
but
she
had
met
with
new
standards
and
learned
to
think
humbly
of
herself
in
the
great
home
of
music
she
possessed
a
genuine
fondness
for
the
art
however
and
had
devoted
most
of
her
three
years
to
it
so
that
she
came
home
rejoicing
in
the
possession
of
a
technic
that
was
quite
a
mastership
compared
with
any
that
she
was
likely
to
meet
helen
thoughts
did
not
dwell
upon
that
very
long
at
present
however
she
found
herself
thinking
again
about
arthur
and
the
unexpected
ending
of
her
walk
with
him
had
no
idea
he
felt
that
way
toward
me
she
mused
resting
her
chin
in
her
hand
in
the
world
am
i
going
to
do
men
are
certainly
most
inconvenient
creatures
i
thought
i
was
doing
everything
in
the
world
to
make
him
happy
helen
turned
to
the
music
once
more
but
the
memory
of
the
figure
she
had
left
sunken
helplessly
upon
the
forest
seat
stayed
in
her
mind
do
wonder
if
that
can
be
why
he
did
not
wait
for
me
she
thought
shuddering
he
was
too
wretched
to
see
me
again
what
can
i
do
she
got
up
and
began
walking
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
i
ought
to
go
and
look
for
him
she
mused
was
an
hour
or
two
ago
that
i
left
him
there
and
helen
after
thinking
the
matter
over
had
half
turned
to
leave
when
she
heard
a
step
outside
and
saw
the
door
open
quickly
even
before
she
saw
him
she
knew
who
it
was
for
only
arthur
would
have
entered
without
ringing
the
bell
after
having
pictured
him
overcome
by
despair
it
was
rather
a
blow
to
her
pride
to
see
him
for
he
entered
flushed
and
seemingly
elated
sir
you
treated
me
nicely
she
exclaimed
showing
her
vexation
in
spite
of
herself
will
forgive
me
said
arthur
smiling
be
too
sure
of
it
helen
said
looked
for
you
everywhere
and
i
am
quite
was
obeying
your
high
command
the
other
replied
still
smiling
command
i
told
you
to
wait
for
told
me
something
else
laughed
arthur
spent
all
the
morning
instructing
me
for
it
you
said
helen
it
was
a
broad
and
very
much
prolonged
for
a
sudden
light
was
dawning
upon
the
girl
as
it
came
her
frown
gave
place
to
a
look
of
delight
have
been
writing
me
a
poem
she
cried
eagerly
said
arthur
you
dear
boy
helen
laughed
i
do
forgive
you
but
you
ought
to
have
told
me
for
i
had
to
walk
home
all
alone
and
been
worrying
about
you
i
never
once
thought
of
the
muses
call
without
warning
laughed
arthur
one
has
to
obey
them
you
oh
exclaimed
the
other
so
you
been
wandering
around
the
woods
all
this
time
making
verses
and
you
been
waving
your
arms
and
talking
to
yourself
and
doing
all
sorts
of
crazy
things
i
know
then
as
she
saw
arthur
flush
she
went
on
was
sure
of
it
and
you
ran
away
so
that
i
would
see
you
oh
i
wish
i
known
i
have
hunted
you
up
and
never
come
home
until
i
found
as
was
usual
with
helen
her
momentary
vexation
had
gone
like
april
rain
and
all
her
seriousness
had
vanished
with
it
she
forgot
all
about
the
last
scene
in
the
woods
and
arthur
was
once
more
the
friend
of
her
girlhood
whom
she
might
take
by
the
hand
when
she
chose
and
with
whom
she
might
be
as
free
and
happy
as
when
she
was
alone
with
the
flowers
and
the
wind
it
seemed
as
if
arthur
too
had
vented
all
his
pent
up
emotion
and
returned
to
his
natural
cheerful
self
me
she
cried
you
put
in
all
the
things
i
told
you
about
put
all
i
could
said
arthur
is
a
great
deal
to
only
want
it
to
be
full
of
life
laughed
helen
all
i
care
about
the
man
who
wants
to
write
springtime
poetry
for
me
must
be
wide
awake
i
read
it
to
you
asked
arthur
hesitatingly
of
course
said
helen
read
it
as
if
you
meant
it
if
i
like
it
i
tell
you
wrote
it
for
nothing
but
to
please
was
the
reply
and
arthur
took
a
much
bescrawled
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
the
girl
seated
herself
upon
the
piano
stool
again
and
gazed
up
at
him
as
he
rested
his
elbow
upon
the
top
of
the
piano
and
read
his
lines
there
could
not
have
been
a
situation
in
which
the
young
poet
would
have
read
them
with
more
complete
happiness
and
so
it
was
a
pleasure
to
watch
him
and
helen
eyes
kindled
and
her
cheeks
flushed
brightly
as
she
listened
for
she
found
that
the
verses
had
taken
their
imagery
from
her
very
lips
in
the
golden
glory
ere
the
quivering
sun
was
high
i
heard
the
wind
of
morning
through
the
laughing
meadows
fly
in
his
was
throbbing
all
the
madness
of
the
may
and
he
whispered
thou
hast
labored
thou
art
weary
come
away
thou
shalt
drink
a
fiery
potion
for
thy
prisoned
spirit
pain
thou
shalt
taste
the
ancient
rapture
that
thy
soul
has
sought
in
vain
i
will
tell
thee
of
a
maiden
one
who
has
thy
longing
fanned
spirit
of
the
forest
music
thou
shalt
take
her
by
the
hand
lightly
by
her
rosy
fingers
trembling
with
her
keen
delight
and
her
flying
steps
shall
lead
thee
out
upon
the
mountain
height
to
a
dance
undreamed
of
mortal
to
the
bacchanal
of
spring
where
in
mystic
joy
united
nature
creatures
sing
there
the
green
things
of
the
mountain
and
the
flowers
of
the
valley
in
their
beauty
crimson
morn
there
the
winged
winds
of
morning
spirits
unresting
touched
with
fire
and
the
streamlets
they
whose
leaping
steps
tire
thou
shalt
see
them
ever
circling
round
about
a
rocky
spring
while
the
gaunt
old
madly
their
wide
branches
fling
thou
shalt
tread
the
whirling
measure
bathe
thee
in
its
frenzied
strife
thou
shalt
have
a
mighty
memory
for
thy
spirit
after
life
haste
thee
while
thy
heart
is
burning
while
thine
eyes
have
strength
to
see
hark
behind
yon
blackening
to
the
minstrelsy
see
he
stamps
upon
the
mountains
and
he
leaps
the
valleys
high
now
he
smites
his
forest
and
he
sounds
his
waken
lift
ye
up
ye
creatures
sing
the
song
each
living
thing
join
ye
in
the
mighty
passion
of
the
symphony
of
spring
and
so
the
young
poet
finished
his
cheeks
fairly
on
fire
and
as
he
gazed
down
at
helen
his
hand
trembling
so
that
he
could
hardly
hold
the
paper
one
glance
told
him
that
she
was
pleased
for
the
girl
face
was
flushed
like
his
own
and
her
eyes
were
sparkling
with
delight
arthur
heart
gave
a
great
throb
within
him
like
it
he
exclaimed
arthur
i
do
she
cried
how
glorious
you
must
have
been
and
trembling
with
girlish
delight
she
took
the
paper
from
his
hand
and
placed
it
in
front
of
her
on
the
music
rack
i
should
like
to
write
music
for
it
she
exclaimed
those
lines
about
the
and
she
read
them
aloud
clenching
her
hands
and
shaking
her
head
carried
away
by
the
image
they
brought
before
her
eyes
i
should
like
music
for
it
she
cried
again
do
know
very
much
about
poetry
you
know
she
added
laughing
excitedly
it
about
the
things
i
like
i
ca
help
thinking
it
fine
it
just
the
same
with
music
if
a
man
only
makes
it
swift
and
strong
so
that
it
leaps
and
flies
and
never
tires
that
is
all
i
care
about
and
if
he
just
keeps
his
trombones
till
the
very
last
he
can
carry
me
off
my
feet
though
he
makes
the
worst
noise
that
ever
was
it
the
same
as
a
storm
you
know
arthur
do
you
remember
how
we
used
to
go
up
on
our
hillside
when
the
great
wind
was
coming
and
when
everything
was
growing
still
and
black
and
how
we
used
to
watch
the
big
clouds
and
the
sheets
of
rain
and
run
for
home
when
we
heard
the
thunder
once
when
you
were
away
arthur
i
did
run
for
i
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
and
i
stayed
up
there
and
saw
it
all
singing
the
of
the
valkyries
and
pretending
i
was
one
of
them
and
could
gallop
with
the
wind
for
the
wind
is
fine
arthur
it
fills
you
so
full
of
its
power
that
you
stretch
out
your
arms
to
it
and
it
makes
you
sing
and
it
comes
and
it
comes
again
stronger
than
ever
and
it
sweeps
you
on
just
like
a
great
mass
of
music
and
then
it
howls
through
the
trees
and
it
flies
over
the
valleys
that
was
what
you
were
thinking
of
were
you
arthur
and
helen
stopped
breathlessly
and
gazed
at
him
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
hands
still
tightly
clasped
said
arthur
half
mechanically
for
he
had
lost
himself
in
the
girl
enthusiasm
and
felt
the
storm
of
his
verses
once
more
poem
made
me
think
of
that
one
time
that
was
so
gloriously
helen
went
on
the
rain
was
almost
blinding
and
i
was
drenched
but
i
did
not
even
know
it
for
oh
the
thunder
arthur
you
no
idea
what
thunder
is
like
till
you
near
it
there
fell
one
fearful
bolt
quite
near
me
a
great
white
living
thing
as
thick
as
a
man
body
and
the
crash
of
it
seemed
to
split
the
air
but
oh
i
did
mind
it
a
bit
sanger
triumphirt
in
wettern
i
think
i
was
a
real
valkyrie
that
time
and
i
only
wished
that
i
might
put
it
into
the
girl
turned
to
the
piano
and
half
in
play
struck
a
great
rumbling
chord
that
rolled
and
echoed
through
the
room
she
sounded
it
once
more
laughing
aloud
with
glee
arthur
had
sunk
down
upon
a
chair
beside
her
and
was
bending
forward
watching
her
with
growing
excitement
for
again
and
again
helen
struck
the
keys
with
all
the
power
of
her
arms
until
they
seemed
to
give
forth
real
storm
and
thunder
and
as
she
went
on
with
her
reckless
play
the
mood
grew
upon
her
and
she
lost
herself
in
the
vision
of
the
sweeping
through
the
sky
she
poured
out
a
great
stream
of
his
wild
music
singing
away
to
herself
excitedly
in
the
meantime
and
as
the
rush
continued
and
the
fierce
music
swelled
louder
the
phantasy
took
hold
of
the
girl
and
carried
her
beyond
herself
she
seemed
to
become
the
very
demon
of
the
storm
unbound
and
reckless
she
smote
the
keys
with
right
royal
strength
and
the
piano
seemed
a
thing
of
life
beneath
her
touch
the
pace
became
faster
and
the
thunder
rattled
and
crashed
more
wildly
and
there
awoke
in
the
girl
soul
a
power
of
musical
utterance
that
she
had
never
dreamed
of
in
her
life
before
her
whole
being
was
swept
away
in
ecstasy
her
lips
were
moving
excitedly
and
her
pulses
were
leaping
like
mad
she
seemed
no
longer
to
know
of
the
young
man
beside
her
who
was
bent
forward
with
clenched
hands
carried
beyond
himself
by
the
sight
of
her
exulting
power
and
in
the
meantime
helen
music
was
surging
on
building
itself
up
into
a
great
climax
that
swelled
and
soared
and
burst
in
a
deafening
thunder
crash
and
while
the
air
was
still
throbbing
and
echoing
with
it
the
girl
joined
to
it
her
deep
voice
grown
suddenly
conscious
of
new
power
he
stamps
upon
the
mountains
and
he
leaps
the
valleys
high
now
he
smites
his
forest
and
he
sounds
his
thunder
cry
and
as
the
cry
came
the
girl
laughed
aloud
like
a
very
valkyrie
indeed
her
laugh
part
of
the
music
and
carried
on
by
it
and
then
gradually
as
the
tempest
swept
on
the
rolling
thunder
was
lost
in
a
march
that
was
the
very
tread
of
the
and
the
march
broadened
and
the
thunder
died
out
of
it
slowly
and
all
the
wild
confusion
and
then
it
rose
glorious
and
triumphant
and
turned
to
a
mighty
pean
a
mightier
one
than
ever
helen
could
have
made
the
thought
of
it
had
come
to
her
as
an
inspiration
and
as
a
refuge
that
the
glory
of
her
passion
might
not
be
lost
the
march
had
led
her
to
it
and
now
it
had
taken
her
in
its
arms
and
swept
her
away
as
it
had
swept
millions
by
its
majesty
it
was
the
great
ninth
symphony
hymn
thee
joy
from
heaven
descending
daughter
from
elysium
ecstasy
our
hearts
inflaming
to
thy
sacred
shrine
we
come
thine
enchantments
bind
together
those
whom
custom
law
divides
all
are
brothers
all
united
where
thy
gentle
wing
and
helen
sang
it
as
one
possessed
by
it
as
one
made
drunk
with
its
glory
as
the
very
goddess
of
joy
that
she
was
for
the
and
his
legions
had
fled
and
another
vision
had
come
into
her
heart
a
vision
that
every
one
ought
to
carry
with
him
when
the
great
symphony
is
to
be
heard
he
should
see
the
hall
in
vienna
where
it
was
given
for
the
last
time
in
the
great
master
life
and
see
the
great
master
himself
the
bowed
and
broken
figure
that
all
musicians
worship
standing
up
to
conduct
it
and
see
him
leading
it
through
all
its
wild
surging
passion
almost
too
frantic
to
be
endured
and
then
when
the
last
towering
climax
has
passed
and
the
music
has
ceased
and
the
multitude
at
his
back
has
burst
forth
into
its
thundering
shout
see
the
one
pathetic
figure
standing
there
aloft
before
all
eyes
and
still
blindly
beating
the
time
there
must
have
been
tears
in
the
eyes
of
every
man
in
that
place
to
know
the
reason
for
it
that
he
from
whose
heart
all
their
joy
had
come
he
who
was
lord
and
master
of
it
had
never
heard
in
his
life
and
could
never
hope
to
hear
one
sound
of
that
music
he
had
written
but
must
dwell
a
prisoner
in
darkness
and
solitude
forever
that
was
the
picture
before
helen
eyes
she
did
not
think
of
the
fearful
tragedy
of
it
she
had
no
feeling
for
tragedy
she
knew
no
more
about
suffering
than
a
child
just
born
but
joy
she
knew
and
joy
she
was
she
was
the
multitude
lifted
up
in
its
ecstasy
throbbing
burning
and
triumphant
and
she
sang
the
great
choruses
one
after
another
and
the
piano
beneath
her
fingers
thundered
and
rang
with
the
instrumental
part
surely
in
all
music
there
is
no
utterance
of
joy
so
sustained
and
so
overwhelming
in
its
intensity
as
this
it
is
a
frenzy
almost
more
than
man
can
stand
it
is
joy
more
than
human
the
joy
of
existence
every
creature
living
from
kind
nature
breast
receives
good
and
evil
all
are
seeking
for
the
rosy
path
she
and
so
the
torrent
of
passionate
exultation
swept
helen
onward
with
it
until
the
very
end
the
last
frantic
prestissimo
chorus
and
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
flung
up
her
hands
with
a
cry
she
stood
thus
for
a
moment
glowing
with
exultation
and
then
she
sank
down
again
and
sat
staring
before
her
the
music
still
echoing
through
every
fiber
of
her
soul
and
the
shouting
multitude
still
surging
before
her
for
just
how
long
that
lasted
she
knew
not
but
only
that
her
wild
mood
was
gradually
subsiding
and
that
she
felt
herself
sinking
back
as
a
bird
sinks
after
its
flight
then
suddenly
she
turned
arthur
was
at
her
side
and
she
gave
a
cry
for
he
had
seized
her
hand
in
his
and
was
covering
it
with
burning
kisses
arthur
she
gasped
the
young
man
gazed
up
at
her
and
helen
remembered
the
scene
in
the
forest
and
realized
what
she
had
done
she
had
shaken
him
to
the
very
depths
of
his
being
by
the
emotion
which
she
had
flung
loose
before
him
and
he
seemed
beside
himself
at
that
moment
his
hair
disordered
and
his
forehead
hot
and
flushed
he
made
a
move
as
if
to
clasp
the
girl
in
his
arms
and
helen
tore
her
hand
loose
by
main
force
and
sprang
back
to
the
doorway
she
cried
do
you
mean
he
clutched
at
a
chair
for
support
and
stood
staring
at
her
for
fully
a
minute
they
remained
thus
helen
trembling
with
alarm
then
his
head
sank
and
he
flung
himself
down
upon
the
sofa
where
he
lay
sobbing
passionately
helen
remained
gazing
at
him
with
wide
open
and
astonished
eyes
she
exclaimed
again
but
he
did
not
hear
her
for
the
cruel
sobbing
that
shook
his
frame
helen
as
soon
as
her
first
alarm
had
passed
came
softly
nearer
till
she
stood
by
the
sofa
but
still
he
did
not
heed
her
and
she
did
not
dare
even
to
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
she
was
afraid
of
him
her
dearest
friend
and
she
knew
not
what
to
make
of
him
she
whispered
again
when
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
speak
to
me
the
other
gazed
up
at
her
with
a
look
of
such
helpless
despair
and
longing
upon
his
face
that
helen
was
frightened
still
more
he
had
been
sobbing
as
if
his
heart
would
break
but
his
eyes
were
dry
is
the
matter
she
cried
the
young
man
answered
her
hoarsely
you
not
see
what
is
the
matter
helen
i
love
you
and
you
drive
me
mad
the
girl
turned
very
pale
and
lowered
her
eyes
before
his
burning
gaze
the
other
went
on
impetuously
will
break
my
heart
if
you
treat
me
in
this
way
do
you
not
know
that
for
three
long
years
i
have
been
dreaming
of
you
and
of
the
promise
that
you
gave
me
you
told
me
that
you
loved
me
and
that
you
always
would
love
me
you
told
me
that
the
night
before
you
went
away
and
you
kissed
me
all
this
time
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
kiss
and
cherishing
the
memory
of
it
and
waiting
for
you
to
return
i
have
labored
for
no
other
reason
i
have
had
no
other
hope
in
the
world
i
have
kept
your
image
before
me
and
lived
in
it
and
worshiped
before
it
and
the
thought
of
you
has
been
all
that
i
had
when
i
was
tired
and
worn
and
ill
i
could
only
think
of
you
and
remember
your
promise
and
count
the
days
before
your
return
and
oh
it
has
been
so
long
that
i
could
not
stand
it
for
weeks
i
have
been
so
impatient
and
so
filled
with
the
thought
of
the
day
when
i
might
see
you
again
that
i
have
been
helpless
and
half
mad
for
i
thought
that
i
should
take
your
hand
in
mine
and
claim
your
promise
and
this
morning
i
wandered
about
the
woods
for
hours
waiting
for
you
to
come
and
see
how
you
have
treated
me
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
again
and
helen
stood
gazing
at
him
breathing
very
fast
with
alarm
and
unable
to
find
a
word
to
say
he
groaned
without
looking
up
again
you
not
know
that
you
are
beautiful
have
you
no
heart
you
fling
your
soul
bare
before
me
and
you
fill
me
with
this
fearful
passion
you
will
drive
me
mad
arthur
she
protested
could
not
think
of
you
so
i
thought
of
you
as
my
brother
and
i
meant
to
make
you
me
then
he
gasped
staring
at
her
me
once
for
all
you
do
love
me
helen
the
girl
answered
with
a
frank
gaze
that
was
cruel
you
can
never
love
me
you
take
back
the
promise
that
you
made
me
told
you
that
i
was
only
a
child
arthur
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
have
thought
of
the
young
man
choked
back
a
sob
helen
if
you
only
knew
what
cruel
words
those
are
he
groaned
can
not
bear
he
gazed
at
her
with
his
burning
eyes
so
that
the
girl
lowered
hers
again
me
he
exclaimed
am
i
to
do
we
not
remain
friends
just
as
we
used
to
be
she
asked
pleadingly
we
not
talk
together
and
help
each
other
as
before
oh
arthur
i
thought
you
would
come
here
to
live
all
summer
and
how
i
should
like
it
why
can
you
not
can
you
not
let
me
play
for
you
without
without
and
helen
stopped
and
flushed
a
trifle
do
not
know
quite
what
to
make
of
you
she
added
she
was
speaking
kindly
but
to
the
man
beside
her
with
his
burning
heart
her
words
were
hard
to
hear
he
stared
at
her
shuddering
and
then
suddenly
he
clenched
his
hands
and
started
to
his
feet
he
cried
is
but
one
thing
i
must
go
echoed
helen
i
stay
here
and
gaze
at
you
i
shall
go
mad
with
despair
he
exclaimed
incoherently
i
shall
go
mad
for
i
do
love
you
and
you
talk
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
child
helen
i
must
get
this
out
of
my
heart
in
some
way
i
can
not
stay
arthur
the
girl
protested
told
father
you
would
stay
and
you
will
make
yourself
ill
for
you
have
walked
all
every
word
she
uttered
was
more
torment
to
the
other
for
it
showed
him
how
much
his
hopes
were
gone
to
wreck
he
rushed
across
the
room
and
opened
the
door
then
however
he
paused
as
if
that
had
cost
him
all
his
resolution
he
gazed
at
the
girl
with
a
look
of
unspeakable
yearning
his
face
white
and
his
limbs
trembling
beneath
him
wish
me
to
go
helen
he
exclaimed
you
exclaimed
helen
who
was
watching
him
in
alarm
course
not
i
want
you
to
stay
and
see
father
and
hear
you
tell
me
that
you
do
not
love
me
oh
helen
how
can
you
say
it
again
can
you
not
see
what
you
have
done
to
me
cried
the
girl
what
you
have
done
to
me
you
have
made
me
so
that
i
dare
not
stay
near
you
you
love
me
helen
oh
some
time
you
must
and
he
came
toward
her
again
stretching
out
his
arms
to
her
as
she
sprang
back
frowning
he
stopped
and
stood
for
an
instant
half
sinking
then
he
whirled
about
and
darted
out
of
the
door
helen
was
scarcely
able
to
realize
at
first
that
he
was
gone
but
when
she
looked
out
she
saw
that
he
was
already
far
down
the
street
walking
swiftly
for
a
moment
she
thought
of
calling
him
but
she
checked
herself
and
closed
the
door
quietly
instead
after
which
she
walked
slowly
across
the
room
in
the
center
of
it
she
stopped
still
gazing
in
front
of
her
thoughtfully
and
looking
very
grave
indeed
is
dreadful
she
said
slowly
had
no
idea
of
such
a
thing
what
in
the
world
am
i
to
do
there
was
a
tall
mirror
between
the
two
windows
of
the
room
and
helen
went
toward
it
and
stood
in
front
of
it
gazing
earnestly
at
herself
it
true
then
that
i
am
so
very
beautiful
she
mused
even
arthur
must
fall
in
love
with
me
helen
face
was
still
flushed
with
the
glory
of
her
ride
with
the
she
smoothed
back
the
long
strands
of
golden
hair
that
had
come
loose
and
then
she
looked
at
herself
again
is
dreadful
she
said
once
more
half
aloud
do
not
think
i
ever
felt
so
nervous
in
my
life
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
everything
i
did
to
please
him
seemed
only
to
make
him
more
miserable
i
wanted
him
to
be
happy
with
me
i
wanted
him
to
stay
with
and
she
walked
away
frowning
and
seated
herself
at
the
piano
and
began
peevishly
striking
at
the
keys
am
going
to
write
to
him
and
tell
him
that
he
must
get
over
that
dreadfulness
she
muttered
after
a
while
come
back
and
be
friends
with
me
oakdale
will
be
too
stupid
without
him
all
summer
and
i
should
be
she
was
just
rising
impatiently
when
the
front
door
opened
and
her
father
came
in
exclaiming
in
a
cheery
voice
children
then
he
stopped
in
surprise
someone
told
me
arthur
was
here
he
exclaimed
gone
home
again
said
helen
in
a
dissatisfied
tone
exclaimed
the
other
hilltown
i
thought
he
was
going
to
stay
until
did
i
said
helen
he
changed
his
mind
and
decided
that
he
better
i
am
really
disappointed
said
davis
thought
we
should
have
a
little
family
party
i
have
seen
arthur
for
a
is
some
important
reason
said
helen
what
he
told
me
she
did
not
want
her
father
to
have
any
idea
of
the
true
reason
or
to
ask
any
inconvenient
questions
davis
would
perhaps
have
done
so
had
he
not
something
else
on
his
mind
the
way
helen
he
said
must
ask
you
what
in
the
world
was
that
fearful
noise
you
were
making
asked
helen
puzzled
for
a
moment
yes
i
met
old
nelson
coming
down
the
street
and
he
said
that
you
were
making
a
most
dreadful
racket
upon
the
piano
and
shouting
too
and
that
there
were
a
dozen
people
standing
in
the
street
staring
a
sudden
wild
thought
occurred
to
helen
and
she
whirled
about
sure
enough
she
found
the
two
windows
of
the
room
wide
open
and
that
was
too
much
for
her
gravity
she
flung
herself
upon
the
sofa
and
gave
vent
to
peal
after
peal
of
laughter
daddy
she
gasped
daddy
davis
did
not
understand
the
joke
but
he
waited
patiently
taking
off
his
gloves
in
the
meantime
it
is
helen
he
enquired
daddy
exclaimed
the
girl
again
and
lifted
herself
up
and
turned
her
laughing
eyes
upon
him
now
i
understand
why
inspired
people
have
to
live
in
the
country
was
it
helen
it
was
anything
daddy
except
that
i
was
playing
and
singing
for
arthur
and
i
forgot
to
close
the
must
remember
my
love
that
you
live
in
a
clergyman
house
said
davis
have
no
objection
to
merriment
but
it
must
be
within
bounds
nelson
said
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
was
the
helen
made
a
wry
face
at
the
name
the
nelsons
were
a
family
of
methodists
who
lived
across
the
way
methodists
are
people
who
take
life
seriously
as
a
rule
and
helen
thought
the
nelsons
were
very
queer
indeed
bet
he
did
know
what
to
think
she
chuckled
if
he
did
say
it
he
thought
that
was
just
what
to
expect
from
a
clergyman
who
had
a
decanter
of
wine
on
his
dinner
davis
could
not
help
smiling
and
as
for
helen
she
was
herself
all
over
again
for
when
her
father
had
come
in
she
had
about
reached
a
point
where
she
could
no
longer
bear
to
be
serious
and
unhappy
as
he
went
on
to
ask
her
to
be
a
little
less
reckless
helen
put
her
arms
around
him
and
said
with
the
solemnity
that
she
always
wore
when
she
was
gayest
daddy
i
do
know
what
to
do
you
sent
me
to
germany
to
study
music
and
if
i
never
to
play
it
but
helen
such
frantic
dreadful
noise
daddy
the
germans
are
emotional
people
you
know
no
one
would
have
been
in
the
least
surprised
at
that
in
germany
it
was
a
hymn
daddy
hymn
gasped
davis
honestly
said
helen
is
a
wonderful
hymn
every
german
knows
it
nearly
by
davis
had
as
much
knowledge
of
german
music
as
might
be
expected
of
one
who
had
lived
twenty
years
in
the
country
and
heard
three
hymns
and
an
anthem
sung
every
sunday
by
a
volunteer
choir
musical
education
as
all
her
other
education
had
been
superintended
by
aunt
polly
and
the
only
idea
that
came
to
davis
mind
was
of
wagner
whose
name
he
had
heard
people
talk
about
in
connection
with
noise
and
incoherency
he
said
trust
that
is
not
the
kind
of
hymn
you
are
going
to
sing
do
know
was
the
puzzled
reply
see
what
i
can
do
daddy
it
dreadfully
hard
to
find
anything
in
german
music
like
the
practical
lives
that
we
dull
yankees
then
a
sudden
idea
occurred
to
the
girl
and
she
ran
to
the
piano
with
a
gleeful
laugh
see
for
instance
she
said
fumbling
hurriedly
amongst
her
music
was
playing
the
moonlight
sonata
this
morning
and
that
a
good
is
the
kind
of
moonlight
they
have
in
germany
she
laughed
when
she
found
it
after
hammering
out
a
few
discords
of
her
own
she
started
recklessly
into
the
incomprehensible
thundering
away
at
every
crescendo
as
if
to
break
her
fingers
it
fine
daddy
she
cried
gazing
over
her
shoulder
do
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
moon
said
the
clergyman
gazing
helplessly
at
the
open
window
and
wondering
if
another
crowd
was
gathering
what
everybody
been
trying
to
find
out
said
helen
then
as
she
heard
the
dinner
bell
out
in
the
hall
she
ended
with
half
a
dozen
frantic
runs
and
jumping
up
with
the
last
of
them
took
her
father
arm
and
danced
out
of
the
room
with
him
when
we
come
to
see
the
other
side
of
the
moon
she
said
may
discover
all
about
it
or
else
it
because
the
moon
is
supposed
to
set
people
so
they
passed
in
to
dinner
where
helen
was
as
animated
as
ever
poor
arthur
and
his
troubles
seeming
to
have
vanished
completely
from
her
thoughts
in
fact
it
was
not
until
the
meal
was
nearly
over
that
she
spoke
of
them
again
she
noticed
that
it
was
growing
dark
outside
and
she
stepped
to
the
window
just
as
a
distant
rumble
of
thunder
was
heard
me
she
exclaimed
a
fearful
storm
coming
and
poor
arthur
is
out
in
it
he
must
be
a
long
way
from
town
by
this
time
and
there
is
no
house
where
he
can
from
the
window
where
she
stood
she
had
a
view
across
the
hills
in
back
of
the
town
and
could
see
the
black
clouds
coming
swiftly
on
is
like
we
were
imagining
this
morning
she
mused
wonder
if
he
will
think
of
the
dinner
was
over
soon
after
that
and
she
looked
out
again
just
as
the
first
drops
of
rain
were
falling
the
thunder
was
rolling
louder
bringing
to
helen
a
faint
echo
of
her
morning
music
she
went
in
and
sat
down
at
the
piano
her
fingers
roaming
over
the
keys
hesitatingly
wish
i
could
get
it
again
she
mused
seems
like
a
dream
when
i
think
of
it
it
was
so
wild
and
so
wonderful
oh
if
i
could
only
remember
that
march
there
came
a
crash
of
thunder
near
by
as
if
to
help
her
but
helen
found
that
all
efforts
were
in
vain
neither
the
storm
music
nor
the
march
came
back
to
her
and
even
when
she
played
a
few
chords
of
the
great
chorus
she
had
sung
it
sounded
tame
and
commonplace
helen
knew
that
the
glory
of
that
morning
was
gone
where
goes
the
best
inspiration
of
all
humanity
back
into
nothingness
and
night
was
a
shame
she
thought
as
she
rose
discontentedly
from
the
piano
never
was
so
carried
away
by
music
in
my
life
and
the
memory
of
it
would
have
kept
me
happy
for
weeks
if
arthur
been
here
to
trouble
me
then
however
as
she
went
to
the
window
again
to
watch
the
storm
which
was
now
raging
in
all
its
majesty
she
added
more
unselfishly
boy
it
is
dreadful
to
think
of
him
being
out
in
she
saw
a
bolt
of
lightning
strike
in
the
distance
and
she
waited
breathlessly
for
the
thunder
it
was
a
fearful
crash
and
it
made
her
blood
run
faster
and
her
eyes
sparkle
she
exclaimed
it
fine
and
then
she
added
with
a
laugh
can
correct
his
poem
by
it
if
he
wants
to
she
turned
to
go
upstairs
on
the
way
she
stopped
with
a
rather
look
and
said
to
herself
fellow
it
seems
a
shame
to
be
happy
she
stood
for
a
moment
thinking
but
then
she
added
i
declare
i
do
know
what
to
do
for
him
it
surely
is
my
fault
if
i
am
not
in
love
with
him
in
that
mad
fashion
and
i
do
see
why
i
should
make
myself
wretched
about
it
having
thus
silenced
her
conscience
she
went
up
to
unpack
her
trunks
humming
to
herself
on
the
way
knight
a
faithful
sister
love
this
heart

to
thee
i
pray
thee
ask
no
other
love

thee
come
and

see
thee

the
silent
weeping

thine
eyes
i
can
not
bear
to
while
she
was
singing
arthur
was
in
the
midst
of
the
tempest
staggering
towards
his
home
ten
miles
away
he
was
drenched
by
the
cold
rain
and
shivering
and
almost
fainting
from
exhaustion
for
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
early
dawn
yet
so
wretched
and
sick
at
heart
was
he
that
he
felt
nothing
and
scarcely
heard
the
storm
or
realized
where
he
was

helen
had
much
to
do
to
keep
her
busy
during
the
next
few
days
she
had
in
the
first
place
to
receive
visits
from
nearly
everybody
in
oakdale
for
she
was
a
general
favorite
in
the
town
and
besides
that
everyone
was
curious
to
see
what
effect
the
trip
had
had
upon
her
beauty
and
accomplishments
then
too
she
had
the
unpacking
of
an
incredible
number
of
trunks
it
was
true
that
helen
having
been
a
favored
boarder
at
an
aristocratic
seminary
was
not
in
the
habit
of
doing
anything
troublesome
herself
but
she
considered
it
necessary
to
superintend
the
servant
last
of
all
there
was
a
great
event
at
the
house
of
her
aunt
roberts
to
be
anticipated
and
prepared
for
it
has
been
said
that
the
marriage
of
davis
had
been
a
second
romance
in
that
worthy
man
career
he
having
had
the
fortune
to
win
the
love
of
a
daughter
of
a
very
wealthy
family
which
lived
near
oakdale
the
parents
had
of
course
been
bitterly
opposed
to
the
match
but
the
girl
had
had
her
way
unfortunately
however
the
lovers
or
at
any
rate
the
bride
having
been
without
any
real
idea
of
duty
or
sacrifice
the
match
had
proved
one
of
those
that
serve
to
justify
the
opinions
of
people
who
are
the
young
wife
wearying
of
the
lot
she
had
chosen
had
sunk
into
a
state
of
peevish
discontent
from
which
death
came
to
relieve
her
of
this
prodigal
daughter
aunt
polly
was
the
elder
and
wiser
sister
she
had
never
ceased
to
urge
upon
the
other
both
before
and
after
marriage
the
folly
of
her
conduct
and
had
lived
herself
to
be
a
proof
of
her
own
more
excellent
sense
having
married
a
wealthy
stockbroker
who
proved
a
good
investment
trebling
his
own
capital
and
hers
in
a
few
years
aunt
polly
therefore
had
a
fine
home
upon
madison
avenue
in
new
york
and
a
most
aristocratic
a
few
miles
from
oakdale
together
with
the
privilege
of
frequenting
the
best
society
in
new
york
and
of
choosing
her
friends
amongst
the
most
wealthy
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
little
town
this
superiority
to
her
erring
sister
had
probably
been
one
of
the
causes
that
had
contributed
to
develop
the
most
prominent
trait
in
her
character
which
is
perhaps
the
most
prominent
trait
of
high
society
in
general
a
complete
satisfaction
with
the
world
she
knew
and
what
she
knew
about
it
and
the
part
she
played
in
it
for
the
rest
aunt
polly
was
one
of
those
bustling
little
women
who
rule
the
world
in
almost
everything
because
the
world
finds
it
is
too
much
trouble
to
oppose
them
she
had
assumed
and
had
generally
succeeded
in
having
recognized
a
complete
superiority
to
davis
in
her
knowledge
about
life
with
the
result
that
as
has
been
stated
the
education
of
the
one
child
of
the
unfortunate
marriage
had
been
managed
by
her
when
therefore
helen
had
come
off
the
steamer
it
had
been
roberts
who
was
there
to
meet
her
and
the
arrangement
announced
was
that
the
girl
was
to
have
three
days
to
spend
with
her
father
and
was
then
to
come
for
a
week
or
two
at
her
aunt
who
was
just
opening
her
country
home
and
who
intended
to
invite
a
score
of
people
whom
she
considered
for
reasons
of
her
own
proper
persons
for
her
niece
to
meet
roberts
spoke
very
condescendingly
indeed
of
the
company
which
helen
met
at
her
father
davis
having
his
own
opinions
about
the
duty
of
a
clergyman
toward
the
members
of
his
flock
the
arrangement
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
pleased
helen
very
much
indeed
the
atmosphere
of
luxury
and
easy
superiority
which
she
found
at
her
aunt
was
much
to
her
taste
and
she
looked
forward
to
being
a
center
of
attraction
there
with
the
keenest
delight
in
the
meantime
however
she
slaked
her
thirst
for
happiness
just
as
well
at
oakdale
accepting
with
queenly
grace
the
homage
of
all
who
came
to
lay
their
presents
at
her
feet
sunday
proved
to
be
a
day
of
triumph
for
all
the
town
had
come
to
church
and
was
as
much
stirred
by
the
glory
of
her
singing
as
arthur
had
predicted
after
the
service
everyone
waited
to
tell
her
about
it
and
so
she
was
radiant
indeed
by
tuesday
however
all
that
had
come
to
seem
a
trifling
matter
for
that
afternoon
aunt
polly
was
to
come
and
a
new
world
was
to
be
opened
for
her
conquest
helen
was
amusing
herself
by
sorting
out
the
motley
collection
of
souvenirs
and
curios
which
she
had
brought
home
to
decorate
her
room
when
she
heard
a
carriage
drive
up
at
the
door
and
a
minute
later
heard
the
voice
of
roberts
footman
in
the
hall
roberts
herself
did
not
alight
and
helen
kept
her
waiting
only
long
enough
to
slip
on
her
hat
and
to
bid
her
father
a
hurried
farewell
in
a
minute
more
she
was
in
the
carriage
and
was
being
borne
in
state
down
the
main
street
of
oakdale
are
beautiful
my
dear
said
her
aunt
beaming
upon
her
hope
you
are
all
ready
for
your
think
so
said
helen
about
seen
everybody
and
everything
i
wanted
to
at
home
i
been
wonderfully
happy
is
right
my
dear
said
aunt
polly
have
certainly
every
cause
to
be
and
you
would
be
foolish
not
to
make
the
most
of
it
but
i
should
think
this
town
would
seem
a
somewhat
less
important
place
to
you
after
all
that
you
have
seen
of
the
it
does
a
little
laughed
helen
it
seemed
good
to
see
all
the
old
people
told
me
they
saw
arthur
here
on
saturday
said
the
other
you
see
yes
said
helen
what
he
came
for
you
can
fancy
how
glad
i
was
to
meet
him
i
spent
a
couple
of
hours
walking
in
the
woods
with
roberts
look
of
dismay
may
be
imagined
it
was
far
too
great
for
her
to
hide
is
he
now
she
asked
hastily
he
has
gone
home
said
helen
and
she
added
smiling
went
on
saturday
afternoon
because
he
writing
a
poem
about
thunderstorms
and
he
wanted
to
study
that
the
other
was
sufficiently
convinced
of
the
irresponsibility
of
poets
to
be
half
uncertain
whether
helen
was
joking
or
not
it
was
very
frequently
difficult
to
tell
anyway
for
helen
would
look
serious
and
amuse
herself
by
watching
another
person
mystification
a
trait
of
character
which
would
have
been
intolerable
in
anyone
less
fascinating
than
she
perhaps
aunt
polly
thought
something
of
that
as
she
sat
and
watched
the
girl
aunt
polly
was
a
little
woman
who
looked
as
if
she
herself
might
have
once
made
some
pretense
to
being
a
belle
but
she
was
very
humble
before
helen
dear
she
said
minute
that
i
watch
you
i
am
astonished
to
see
how
wonderfully
you
have
grown
do
you
know
helen
you
are
glorious
said
helen
smiling
delightedly
it
nice
aunt
polly
i
so
glad
i
funny
child
laughed
the
other
a
queer
thing
to
say
i
not
to
know
i
am
beautiful
inquired
helen
looking
at
her
with
open
eyes
dear
me
i
can
look
at
myself
in
the
glass
and
be
just
as
happy
as
anyone
else
i
love
everything
aunt
polly
beamed
upon
her
am
glad
of
it
my
dear
she
laughed
only
wish
i
could
say
something
to
you
to
make
you
realize
what
your
wonderful
beauty
aunt
polly
asked
the
girl
you
been
reading
poetry
said
the
other
exactly
but
you
know
very
well
in
your
heart
what
hopes
i
have
for
you
helen
and
i
only
wish
you
could
appreciate
the
gift
that
has
been
given
you
and
not
fling
it
away
in
any
foolish
fashion
with
your
talents
and
your
education
my
dear
there
is
almost
nothing
that
you
might
not
said
helen
with
all
of
her
seriousness
often
think
of
it
perhaps
auntie
i
might
become
a
poetess
the
other
looked
aghast
helen
had
seen
the
look
on
her
aunt
face
at
the
mention
of
her
walk
with
arthur
and
being
a
young
lady
of
electrical
wit
had
understood
just
what
it
meant
and
just
how
the
rest
of
the
conversation
was
intended
to
bear
upon
the
matter
with
that
advantage
she
was
quite
in
her
glory
indeed
aunt
polly
she
said
can
never
tell
just
suppose
for
instance
i
were
to
fall
in
love
with
and
marry
a
man
of
wonderful
genius
who
would
help
me
to
devote
myself
to
art
it
would
not
make
any
difference
you
know
if
he
were
poor
we
could
struggle
and
help
each
other
and
oh
i
tell
you
if
i
were
to
meet
such
a
man
and
to
know
that
he
loved
me
truly
and
to
have
proof
that
he
could
remember
me
and
be
true
to
me
even
when
i
was
far
away
oh
i
tell
you
nothing
could
ever
keep
me
helen
was
declaiming
her
glowing
speech
with
real
fervor
her
hands
dramatically
outstretched
but
she
could
not
get
any
further
for
the
look
of
utter
horror
upon
her
auditor
face
was
too
much
for
her
she
dropped
her
hands
and
made
the
air
echo
with
her
laughter
aunt
polly
you
goose
she
cried
flinging
one
arm
about
her
you
really
forgotten
me
that
much
in
three
years
the
other
was
so
relieved
at
the
happy
denouement
of
that
fearful
tragedy
that
she
could
only
protest
helen
why
do
you
fool
me
so
you
fool
me
or
try
to
said
helen
you
have
a
sermon
to
preach
on
the
impropriety
of
walking
in
the
woods
alone
with
a
susceptible
young
poet
i
wish
you
mount
formally
into
the
pulpit
and
begin
with
the
dear
laughed
the
other
are
too
quick
but
i
must
confess
course
you
must
said
the
girl
and
she
folded
her
hands
meekly
and
looked
grave
now
i
am
ready
and
if
you
meet
with
any
difficulties
in
the
course
of
your
sermon
i
an
expert
at
home
who
has
preached
one
hundred
and
four
every
year
for
twenty
years
all
genuine
and
no
two
said
the
other
do
wish
you
would
talk
seriously
with
me
you
are
old
enough
to
be
your
own
mistress
now
and
to
do
as
you
please
but
you
ought
to
realize
that
i
have
seen
the
world
more
than
you
and
that
my
advice
is
worth
it
to
me
said
helen
ceasing
to
laugh
and
leaning
back
in
the
carriage
and
gazing
at
her
aunt
do
you
want
me
to
do
now
that
i
am
home
i
will
be
really
serious
if
you
wish
me
to
for
that
does
interest
me
i
suppose
that
my
education
is
finished
said
the
other
ought
to
be
certainly
you
have
had
every
advantage
that
a
girl
can
have
a
great
deal
more
than
i
ever
had
and
you
owe
it
all
to
me
helen
you
do
really
if
it
been
for
my
insisting
you
have
gotten
all
your
education
at
hilltown
and
you
have
played
the
piano
and
sung
like
mary
nelson
across
the
helen
shuddered
and
felt
that
that
was
cause
indeed
for
gratitude
is
true
said
her
aunt
taken
as
much
interest
in
you
as
in
any
one
of
my
own
children
and
you
must
know
it
it
was
for
no
reason
at
all
but
that
i
saw
what
a
wonderful
woman
you
promised
to
become
and
i
was
anxious
to
help
you
to
the
social
position
that
i
thought
you
ought
to
have
and
now
helen
the
chance
is
yours
if
you
care
to
take
am
taking
it
am
i
not
asked
helen
going
with
you
and
i
shall
be
just
as
charming
as
i
i
know
said
the
other
smiling
a
little
that
is
not
exactly
what
i
do
you
mean
course
my
dear
you
may
enter
good
society
a
while
by
visiting
me
but
that
will
not
be
permanently
you
will
have
to
marry
into
it
helen
echoed
the
girl
taken
aback
me
will
wish
to
marry
some
time
said
the
other
so
you
should
look
forward
to
it
and
choose
your
course
with
your
charms
helen
there
is
almost
nothing
that
you
might
not
hope
for
you
must
know
yourself
that
you
could
make
any
man
fall
in
love
with
you
that
you
wished
and
you
ought
to
know
also
that
if
you
only
had
wealth
you
could
enter
any
society
for
you
have
good
birth
and
you
will
discover
that
you
have
more
knowledge
and
more
wit
than
most
of
the
people
you
discovered
that
already
said
helen
laughing
that
you
must
do
my
love
went
on
the
other
to
realize
what
is
before
you
and
make
up
your
mind
to
what
you
want
you
know
that
your
tastes
are
not
those
of
a
poor
woman
you
have
been
accustomed
to
comfort
and
you
need
refinement
and
wealth
you
could
never
be
happy
unless
you
could
entertain
your
friends
properly
and
live
as
you
i
do
want
to
marry
a
man
just
for
his
money
protested
the
girl
not
altogether
pleased
with
her
aunt
view
one
wants
you
to
the
other
responded
may
marry
for
love
if
you
like
but
it
is
not
impossible
to
love
a
rich
man
is
it
helen
aunt
polly
said
helen
am
satisfied
as
i
am
now
i
do
not
want
to
marry
anybody
the
very
idea
makes
me
am
not
in
the
least
anxious
that
you
should
was
the
answer
are
young
and
you
may
choose
your
own
time
all
i
am
anxious
for
is
that
you
should
realize
the
future
that
is
before
you
it
is
dreadful
to
me
to
think
that
you
might
throw
your
precious
chance
away
by
some
ridiculous
helen
looked
at
her
aunt
for
a
moment
and
then
the
irrepressible
smile
broke
out
is
the
matter
child
asked
the
other
except
that
i
was
thinking
about
how
these
thoughts
were
brought
do
you
mean
of
my
woodland
walk
with
poor
arthur
auntie
i
do
believe
you
afraid
i
going
to
fall
in
love
with
the
dear
said
aunt
polly
is
not
exactly
that
for
i
never
be
able
to
sleep
at
night
if
i
thought
you
capable
of
anything
quite
so
ghastly
but
we
must
have
some
care
of
what
people
will
think
my
dear
as
a
matter
of
fact
aunt
polly
did
have
some
very
serious
fears
about
the
matter
as
has
been
hinted
before
it
was
perhaps
a
kind
of
tribute
to
the
divine
fire
which
even
society
leaders
pay
if
it
had
been
a
question
of
a
person
of
her
own
sense
and
experience
the
word
would
have
suggested
no
danger
to
roberts
but
it
was
different
with
a
young
and
probably
sentimental
person
like
helen
with
her
inflaming
beauty
a
matter
of
fact
aunt
polly
said
helen
understands
my
intimacy
with
me
helen
dear
said
the
other
turning
her
keen
glance
upon
her
me
the
honest
what
are
not
in
love
with
arthur
and
helen
answered
her
with
her
eyes
very
wide
open
i
certainly
am
not
in
the
and
the
other
drew
secretly
a
great
breath
of
relief
he
in
love
with
you
helen
she
asked
as
helen
thought
of
arthur
departure
the
question
could
not
but
bring
a
smile
i
afraid
he
is
she
very
a
ridiculous
impertinence
exclaimed
the
other
indignantly
that
all
right
auntie
said
helen
really
ca
help
it
you
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
she
went
on
things
used
to
puzzle
me
when
i
was
very
young
and
i
used
to
think
them
quite
exciting
but
i
getting
used
to
them
now
all
the
men
seem
to
fall
in
love
with
me
they
do
honestly
and
i
do
know
how
in
the
world
to
help
it
they
all
will
make
themselves
wretched
and
i
sure
it
is
my
fault
i
have
told
you
anything
about
my
german
lovers
have
i
auntie
no
said
the
other
there
any
laughed
the
girl
might
have
robbed
the
emperor
of
a
whole
colonel
staff
and
the
colonel
at
the
head
of
it
but
i
tell
you
about
johann
the
funniest
one
of
all
i
think
he
really
loved
me
more
than
all
the
who
was
johann
asked
aunt
polly
thinking
how
fortunate
it
was
that
she
learned
of
these
things
only
after
the
danger
was
over
never
will
forget
the
first
time
i
met
him
laughed
the
girl
first
day
i
went
to
the
school
johann
was
a
little
boy
who
opened
the
door
for
me
and
he
stared
at
me
as
if
he
were
in
a
trance
he
had
the
most
wonderful
round
eyes
and
puffy
red
cheeks
that
made
me
always
think
i
happened
to
ring
the
bell
while
he
was
eating
and
every
time
after
that
he
saw
me
for
three
years
he
used
to
gaze
at
me
in
the
same
helpless
wonder
with
all
lingers
of
his
fat
little
hands
wide
a
disagreeable
wretch
said
the
other
in
the
least
laughed
helen
liked
him
but
the
funniest
part
came
afterwards
for
when
i
came
away
johann
had
grown
a
whole
foot
and
was
quite
a
man
i
sent
for
him
to
put
the
straps
on
my
trunks
and
guess
what
he
did
he
stared
at
me
for
a
minute
just
the
same
as
ever
and
then
he
ran
out
of
the
room
blubbering
like
a
baby
and
that
the
last
i
ever
saw
of
helen
was
laughing
as
she
told
the
story
but
then
she
stopped
and
looked
a
little
you
know
aunt
polly
she
said
is
really
a
dreadful
thing
to
make
people
unhappy
like
that
i
suppose
poor
johann
had
spent
three
whole
years
dreaming
about
the
enchanted
castle
in
which
i
was
to
be
fairy
was
a
good
chance
for
a
romantic
marriage
said
the
other
said
the
girl
laughing
again
tried
to
fancy
it
have
kept
a
wirthshaus
i
suppose
and
i
have
served
the
guests
and
arthur
might
have
come
and
i
have
cut
butterbrod
for
him
and
he
could
have
been
my
werther
would
arthur
have
made
a
fine
werther
though
aunt
polly
blown
his
brains
out
afterwards
added
the
other
said
helen
are
too
scarce
i
rather
have
him
follow
goethe
example
and
write
a
book
about
it
instead
you
know
i
believe
half
the
things
these
poets
tell
you
for
i
think
they
put
themselves
through
their
dreadful
experiences
just
to
tell
about
them
and
make
themselves
famous
do
you
believe
that
auntie
do
know
said
the
other
a
statement
which
she
seldom
made
do
know
much
about
such
things
nobody
reads
poetry
any
more
you
know
helen
and
it
does
really
help
one
along
very
does
do
any
harm
does
it
inquired
the
girl
smiling
to
herself
a
little
once
in
a
while
no
of
course
not
said
the
other
believe
that
a
woman
ought
to
have
a
broad
education
for
she
never
knows
what
may
be
the
whims
of
the
men
she
meets
or
what
turn
a
conversation
may
take
all
i
afraid
of
helen
is
that
if
you
fill
your
mind
with
sentimental
ideas
you
might
be
so
silly
as
to
fancy
that
you
were
doing
something
romantic
in
throwing
your
one
great
chance
away
upon
some
worthless
nobody
i
want
you
to
realize
what
you
are
helen
and
that
you
owe
something
to
yourself
and
to
your
family
too
for
the
roberts
have
always
had
wealth
and
position
until
your
mother
chose
to
marry
a
poor
man
what
i
warn
you
of
now
is
exactly
what
i
warned
her
of
your
father
is
a
good
man
but
he
had
absolutely
nothing
to
make
your
mother
happy
she
was
cut
off
from
everything
she
had
been
used
to
she
could
not
even
keep
a
carriage
and
of
course
she
could
not
receive
her
old
friends
very
few
of
them
cared
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
her
and
so
she
simply
pined
away
in
discontentment
and
miserable
poverty
you
have
had
an
easy
life
helen
and
you
have
no
idea
of
what
a
horrible
thing
it
is
to
be
poor
you
have
had
the
best
of
teachers
and
you
have
lived
at
an
expensive
school
and
of
course
you
have
always
had
me
to
rely
upon
to
introduce
you
to
the
right
people
but
if
you
married
a
poor
man
you
could
expect
to
keep
any
of
those
advantages
i
do
speak
of
your
marrying
a
man
who
had
no
money
at
all
for
that
would
be
too
fearful
to
talk
about
but
suppose
you
were
to
take
any
one
of
the
young
men
you
might
meet
at
oakdale
even
you
have
to
live
in
a
mean
little
house
and
do
with
one
or
two
servants
and
worry
yourself
about
the
butcher
bills
and
brush
your
own
dresses
and
drive
your
own
horse
and
how
long
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
before
you
repented
of
that
think
of
having
to
be
like
those
poor
masons
for
instance
they
are
nice
people
and
i
like
them
but
i
hate
to
go
there
for
every
time
i
ca
help
seeing
that
the
parlor
furniture
is
more
dingy
and
thinking
how
miserable
they
must
be
not
to
be
able
to
buy
new
things
and
their
servants
liveries
are
half
worn
too
and
when
you
dine
there
you
see
that
mason
is
eating
with
a
plated
fork
because
she
has
not
enough
of
her
best
silver
to
go
around
all
those
things
are
trifles
helen
but
think
of
the
worry
they
must
give
those
poor
people
who
are
pinching
themselves
and
wearing
themselves
out
soul
and
body
trying
to
keep
in
the
station
where
they
belong
or
used
to
poor
mason
is
pale
and
nervous
and
wrinkled
at
forty
and
those
three
poor
girls
who
spend
their
time
making
over
their
old
dresses
are
so
and
uneasy
that
no
man
ever
glances
at
them
twice
it
is
such
misery
as
that
which
i
dread
for
you
helen
and
why
i
am
talking
to
you
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
take
upon
you
such
sorrows
you
have
a
clear
head
and
you
can
think
for
yourself
and
make
up
your
mind
about
things
if
you
only
wo
blind
yourself
by
foolish
sentimentality
you
have
been
brought
up
to
a
certain
station
in
life
and
no
man
has
a
right
to
offer
himself
to
you
unless
he
can
maintain
you
in
that
station
there
is
really
no
scarcity
of
such
men
helen
and
you
have
no
trouble
in
finding
one
there
are
hundreds
of
men
in
new
york
who
are
worth
millions
and
who
would
fling
themselves
and
their
wealth
at
your
feet
if
you
would
have
them
and
you
would
find
such
a
difference
between
the
opportunities
of
pleasure
and
command
that
such
a
chance
would
give
you
and
the
narrow
life
that
you
lead
in
this
little
town
that
you
would
wonder
how
you
could
ever
have
been
satisfied
it
is
difficult
for
you
to
realize
what
i
mean
my
dear
because
you
have
only
a
schoolgirl
knowledge
of
life
and
its
pleasures
but
when
you
are
in
the
world
and
have
learned
what
power
is
and
what
it
means
to
possess
such
beauty
as
yours
you
will
feel
your
heart
swelling
with
a
new
pleasure
and
you
will
thank
me
for
what
i
tell
you
i
have
figured
a
wonderful
triumph
for
you
helen
and
it
is
time
you
knew
what
is
before
you
of
what
use
is
your
beauty
if
you
do
not
carry
it
into
a
wide
enough
sphere
where
it
can
bring
you
the
admiration
and
homage
you
deserve
you
need
such
a
field
helen
to
discover
your
own
powers
in
believe
me
my
dear
there
is
really
a
higher
ambition
in
the
world
than
to
be
a
country
clergyman
there
any
higher
than
being
happy
auntie
asked
helen
the
importance
of
that
observation
was
beyond
the
other
ken
as
indeed
it
was
beyond
helen
also
she
had
thrown
it
out
as
a
chance
remark
roberts
and
i
were
talking
about
this
last
night
went
on
aunt
polly
he
told
me
that
i
ought
to
talk
seriously
to
you
about
it
and
get
you
to
realize
what
a
golden
future
is
before
you
for
it
is
really
true
helen
as
sure
as
you
can
trust
what
i
know
about
the
world
that
you
can
have
absolutely
anything
that
you
want
that
is
the
long
and
short
of
the
matter
anything
that
you
want
and
why
should
you
not
have
the
very
best
that
life
can
give
you
why
should
you
have
to
know
that
other
people
dwell
in
finer
houses
than
yours
and
are
free
from
cares
that
make
you
ill
why
should
you
have
the
humiliation
of
being
looked
down
upon
and
scorned
by
other
people
are
these
other
people
more
entitled
to
luxury
than
you
or
more
able
to
enjoy
it
or
could
anyone
do
it
more
honor
than
you
you
are
beautiful
beyond
telling
you
have
every
gift
that
a
woman
can
ask
to
complete
enjoyment
of
life
you
are
perfect
helen
you
are
really
perfect
you
know
that
you
must
say
it
to
yourself
when
you
are
alone
and
know
that
your
life
ought
to
be
a
queenly
triumph
you
have
only
to
stretch
out
your
arms
and
everything
will
come
to
you
and
there
is
really
and
truly
no
end
to
the
happiness
you
can
helen
was
gazing
at
the
other
with
real
earnestness
and
the
words
were
sinking
deep
into
her
soul
deeper
than
words
generally
sunk
there
she
felt
her
cheeks
burning
and
her
frame
stirred
by
a
new
emotion
she
had
seldom
before
thought
of
anything
but
the
happiness
of
the
hour
think
of
it
my
love
continued
roberts
know
that
that
is
what
your
old
auntie
was
thinking
of
when
you
were
only
a
little
tiny
girl
sitting
upon
her
knee
and
when
you
were
so
beautiful
that
artists
used
to
beg
to
have
you
pose
for
them
i
never
said
anything
about
it
then
because
you
were
too
young
to
understand
these
things
but
now
that
you
are
to
manage
yourself
i
have
been
waiting
for
a
chance
to
tell
you
so
that
you
may
see
what
a
prize
is
yours
if
you
are
only
wise
and
if
you
wonder
why
i
have
cared
so
much
and
thought
so
much
of
what
might
be
yours
the
only
reason
i
can
give
is
that
you
are
my
niece
and
that
i
felt
that
any
triumph
you
might
win
would
be
mine
i
want
you
to
win
a
higher
place
in
the
world
than
mine
helen
i
never
had
such
a
gift
as
helen
was
silent
for
a
minute
deeply
thoughtful
me
auntie
she
asked
is
it
really
true
then
that
a
woman
is
to
train
herself
and
grow
beautiful
and
to
have
so
much
trouble
and
money
spent
upon
her
only
for
her
marriage
of
course
helen
what
else
can
a
woman
do
unless
you
have
money
and
a
husband
you
can
not
possibly
hope
to
accomplish
anything
in
society
with
your
talents
and
your
beauty
you
might
go
anywhere
and
rule
anywhere
but
you
have
to
have
money
before
you
can
even
where
am
i
to
meet
such
a
rich
man
aunt
polly
asked
helen
know
perfectly
well
where
do
you
suppose
that
after
i
have
worried
myself
about
you
all
this
time
i
mean
to
desert
you
now
when
you
are
at
the
very
climax
of
your
glory
when
you
are
all
that
i
ever
dared
dream
of
my
dear
helen
i
am
more
interested
in
you
just
now
than
in
anything
else
in
the
world
i
feel
as
a
card
player
feels
when
millions
are
at
stake
and
when
he
knows
that
he
holds
the
perfect
is
very
nice
said
helen
laughing
nervously
there
is
always
a
chance
of
is
none
this
time
helen
for
i
am
an
old
player
and
i
have
been
picking
and
arranging
my
hand
for
long
long
years
and
you
are
the
hand
my
love
and
the
greatest
glory
of
it
all
must
be
helen
heart
was
throbbing
still
faster
with
excitement
as
if
she
were
already
tasting
the
wonderful
triumph
that
was
before
her
her
aunt
was
watching
her
closely
noting
how
the
blood
was
mounting
to
her
bright
cheeks
the
girl
felt
herself
suddenly
choking
with
her
pent
up
excitement
and
she
stretched
out
her
arms
with
a
strange
laugh
she
said
tell
me
too
much
at
the
other
had
been
marshaling
her
forces
like
a
general
during
the
last
few
minutes
and
she
felt
just
then
as
if
there
were
nothing
left
but
the
rout
that
i
tell
you
you
may
see
for
yourself
she
said
do
ask
you
to
take
anything
on
my
word
for
you
have
only
to
look
in
the
glass
and
compare
yourself
with
the
women
you
meet
you
will
find
that
all
men
will
turn
their
eyes
upon
you
when
you
enter
a
helen
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
debate
that
question
have
invited
some
rich
man
to
meet
me
at
your
house
she
asked
was
going
to
say
nothing
to
you
about
it
at
first
said
the
other
let
you
find
out
but
i
thought
afterwards
that
it
would
be
better
to
tell
you
so
that
you
could
manage
for
yourself
i
have
invited
all
the
men
whom
roberts
and
i
thought
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
helen
gazed
at
her
aunt
silently
for
a
moment
and
then
she
broke
into
a
nervous
laugh
regular
exposition
she
said
bring
them
out
one
by
one
and
put
them
through
their
paces
you
auntie
and
have
them
labeled
for
comparison
so
that
i
can
tell
just
what
stocks
they
own
and
how
they
stand
on
the
do
you
remember
the
suitor
in
moliere
quinze
mille
livres
de
rente
le
corps
sain
des
beaux
dents
it
was
a
flash
of
helen
old
merriment
but
it
did
not
seem
so
natural
as
usual
even
to
her
she
forced
herself
to
laugh
for
she
was
growing
more
and
more
excited
and
uneasy
dear
said
aunt
polly
do
not
begin
making
fun
you
must
let
me
joke
a
little
auntie
said
the
girl
have
never
been
serious
for
so
long
ought
to
be
serious
about
it
my
will
said
helen
have
really
listened
attentively
you
must
tell
me
all
about
these
rich
men
that
i
am
to
meet
and
what
i
am
to
do
i
hope
i
am
not
the
only
course
not
was
the
response
would
not
do
anything
ridiculous
i
have
invited
a
number
of
other
girls
but
they
trouble
you
in
the
said
helen
am
not
afraid
of
other
girls
but
what
to
be
done
it
a
sort
of
i
suppose
was
the
reply
suppose
so
for
i
only
came
down
last
week
myself
i
have
asked
about
twenty
people
for
a
week
or
two
they
all
know
each
other
more
or
less
so
there
wo
be
much
formality
we
shall
amuse
ourselves
with
coaching
and
golf
and
anything
else
we
please
and
of
course
there
will
be
plenty
of
music
in
the
helen
smiled
at
the
significant
tone
of
her
aunt
voice
the
people
there
now
she
asked
who
live
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
are
most
of
the
men
will
be
down
on
the
afternoon
train
in
time
for
tell
me
who
are
the
men
auntie
afraid
i
wo
have
time
said
roberts
glancing
out
of
the
carriage
are
too
near
home
but
i
will
tell
you
about
one
of
them
if
you
laughed
helen
there
a
said
roberts
is
at
any
rate
my
husband
and
i
think
he
is
and
we
are
anxious
to
see
what
you
think
his
name
is
gerald
harrison
and
he
comes
from
dear
said
helen
hate
to
meet
men
from
the
west
he
must
be
a
or
something
said
the
other
is
a
railroad
why
do
you
think
he
the
is
he
very
rich
is
worth
about
ten
million
dollars
said
aunt
polly
helen
gazed
at
her
wildly
million
dollars
she
gasped
said
the
other
that
probably
a
little
more
roberts
knows
all
about
his
helen
was
staring
into
her
aunt
face
me
she
asked
very
nervously
indeed
me
honestly
that
the
man
you
are
bringing
me
here
to
meet
helen
said
the
other
quietly
the
girl
hands
were
clasped
tightly
together
just
then
polly
she
asked
kind
of
a
man
is
he
i
will
not
marry
a
bad
man
bad
man
child
how
ridiculous
do
you
suppose
i
would
ask
you
to
marry
a
bad
man
if
he
owned
all
new
york
i
want
you
to
be
happy
harrison
is
a
man
who
has
made
his
own
fortune
and
he
is
a
man
of
tremendous
energy
everyone
is
obliged
to
respect
he
must
be
old
is
very
young
helen
only
about
me
said
the
girl
could
never
marry
a
man
as
old
as
forty
and
then
i
have
to
go
out
west
harrison
has
come
to
new
york
to
live
was
the
other
reply
has
just
bought
a
really
magnificent
country
seat
about
ten
miles
from
here
the
old
everson
place
if
you
remember
it
and
he
is
negotiating
for
a
house
near
ours
in
the
city
my
husband
and
i
both
agreed
helen
that
if
you
could
make
harrison
fall
in
love
with
you
it
would
be
all
that
we
could
is
not
the
real
problem
helen
said
gazing
out
of
the
carriage
with
a
frightened
look
upon
her
face
is
whether
i
can
fall
in
love
with
him
aunt
polly
it
is
dreadful
to
me
to
think
of
marrying
i
do
want
to
marry
i
do
care
who
the
man
is
see
about
that
later
on
said
the
other
smiling
reassuringly
and
at
the
same
time
putting
her
arm
about
the
girl
is
no
hurry
my
love
and
no
one
has
the
least
thought
of
asking
you
to
do
what
you
do
not
want
to
do
but
a
chance
like
this
does
not
come
often
to
any
girl
my
dear
harrison
is
in
every
way
a
desirable
he
stupid
aunt
polly
i
know
he
stupid
all
men
are
they
tell
you
about
how
they
made
themselves
and
what
wonderful
things
they
hare
made
must
of
course
not
expect
to
find
harrison
as
cultured
as
yourself
helen
was
the
reply
education
has
been
that
of
the
world
and
not
of
books
but
nobody
thinks
less
of
a
man
for
that
in
the
world
the
most
one
can
ask
is
that
he
does
not
make
pretenses
and
he
is
very
far
from
stupid
i
assure
you
or
he
would
not
have
been
what
he
suppose
not
said
helen
weakly
besides
observed
aunt
polly
laughing
to
cheer
the
girl
up
assure
you
it
does
make
any
difference
my
husband
makes
no
pretense
to
being
a
wit
or
a
musician
or
anything
like
that
just
a
plain
sensible
man
but
we
get
along
as
happily
as
you
could
wish
we
each
of
us
go
our
own
way
and
understand
each
other
i
to
marry
a
plain
sensible
man
asked
the
girl
apparently
not
much
comforted
by
the
observation
plain
sensible
man
with
ten
million
dollars
my
dear
said
aunt
polly
adores
you
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
money
but
to
let
you
make
yourself
happy
and
glorious
with
it
but
do
worry
yourself
my
child
because
the
first
thing
for
you
to
feel
is
that
if
you
do
like
him
you
need
not
take
him
it
all
rests
upon
you
he
wo
be
here
till
after
the
rest
till
the
evening
train
so
you
can
have
time
to
think
it
over
and
calculate
whether
ten
million
dollars
will
buy
anything
you
and
roberts
laughed
then
the
carriage
having
passed
within
the
gates
of
her
home
she
kissed
the
girl
upon
her
cheek
the
way
she
added
you
want
to
meet
a
romantic
person
to
offset
harrison
i
tell
you
about
howard
i
have
mentioned
him
have
i
never
heard
of
him
said
helen
a
real
romance
said
the
other
did
suppose
that
your
sensible
old
auntie
could
have
a
romance
did
you
me
about
it
laughed
helen
the
carriage
was
driving
up
the
broad
avenue
that
led
to
the
roberts
house
it
was
a
drive
of
a
minute
or
two
however
and
so
aunt
polly
had
time
for
a
hasty
explanation
was
over
twenty
years
ago
she
said
your
mother
was
married
and
when
our
family
had
a
camp
up
in
the
adirondacks
there
were
only
two
others
near
us
and
in
each
of
them
there
was
a
young
man
about
my
age
we
three
were
great
friends
for
three
or
four
years
but
we
never
seen
each
other
since
till
a
short
while
one
of
them
is
this
man
said
roberts
name
is
david
howard
i
met
him
quite
by
accident
the
other
day
and
recognized
him
he
lives
all
alone
in
the
winter
in
new
york
somewheres
and
in
the
summer
up
at
the
same
place
in
the
mountains
he
the
most
romantic
man
you
ever
met
and
i
know
you
find
him
interesting
he
a
poet
i
fancy
or
a
musician
at
any
rate
and
he
a
very
great
he
rich
too
asked
the
girl
laughing
fancy
not
was
the
reply
i
ca
tell
he
lives
very
you
afraid
i
fall
in
love
with
him
auntie
said
the
other
smiling
to
herself
not
worrying
about
not
till
you
see
him
my
dear
was
the
reply
you
choose
him
for
a
husband
i
give
my
sounds
mysterious
observed
the
girl
gazing
at
her
aunt
me
is
he
here
now
said
aunt
polly
been
here
a
day
or
two
but
i
think
you
see
him
at
dinner
because
he
has
been
feeling
unwell
today
he
may
be
down
a
while
this
evening
for
i
been
telling
him
about
you
and
he
anxious
to
see
you
you
must
be
nice
to
him
helen
and
try
to
feel
as
sorry
for
him
as
i
for
him
echoed
the
girl
with
a
start
my
dear
he
is
an
invalid
with
some
very
dreadful
and
helen
stared
at
her
aunt
affliction
she
cried
polly
that
is
horrible
what
in
the
world
did
you
invite
an
invalid
for
at
this
time
with
all
the
other
people
i
invalids
had
asked
him
before
was
the
apologetic
reply
so
i
could
help
it
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
promise
to
come
anyway
for
he
a
very
strange
solitary
man
but
i
wanted
to
have
my
little
romance
and
renew
our
acquaintance
and
this
was
the
only
time
the
third
party
could
the
third
one
is
here
too
will
be
in
a
day
or
is
he
name
is
lieutenant
maynard
and
he
in
the
navy
stationed
at
brooklyn
just
now
but
he
expects
to
get
leave
for
a
is
a
little
better
helen
remarked
as
the
carriage
was
drawing
up
in
front
of
the
great
house
marry
a
naval
laughed
aunt
polly
leaves
a
wife
and
some
children
in
brooklyn
we
three
are
going
to
keep
to
ourselves
and
talk
about
old
times
and
what
has
happened
to
us
since
then
and
so
you
young
folks
will
not
be
troubled
by
hope
you
will
said
the
other
i
ca
ever
be
happy
with
and
there
as
the
carriage
door
was
opened
the
conversation
ended
abruptly
when
helen
had
sprung
out
she
found
that
there
were
six
or
eight
people
upon
the
piazza
to
whom
the
excitement
of
being
introduced
drove
from
her
mind
for
a
time
all
thoughts
which
her
aunt
words
had
brought
chapter
v
chance
will
have
me
king
why
chance
may
crown
me
without
my
most
of
the
people
whom
helen
met
upon
her
arrival
were
of
her
own
sex
so
that
she
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
make
special
exertions
to
please
them
but
she
was
naturally
cheerful
and
happy
with
everyone
and
the
other
matters
of
which
roberts
had
talked
took
on
such
vast
proportions
before
her
mind
that
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
put
them
aside
and
enjoy
herself
for
a
while
in
her
usual
way
helen
was
glad
that
most
of
the
men
were
to
arrive
later
so
that
she
might
make
her
appearance
before
them
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
when
she
heard
the
distant
whistle
of
the
afternoon
train
a
couple
of
hours
later
it
was
with
that
thought
that
she
retired
to
her
room
to
rest
before
dressing
aunt
polly
following
her
plan
of
accustoming
the
girl
to
a
proper
style
of
living
had
engaged
a
maid
to
attend
her
during
her
stay
and
helen
found
therefore
that
her
trunks
were
unpacked
and
everything
in
order
it
was
a
great
relief
to
her
to
be
rid
of
all
care
and
she
took
off
her
dress
and
flung
herself
down
upon
the
bed
to
think
helen
had
imbided
during
her
days
the
usual
formulas
of
dogmatic
religion
but
upon
matters
of
morality
her
ideas
were
of
the
vaguest
possible
description
the
guide
of
her
life
had
always
been
her
instinct
for
happiness
her
sense
of
she
had
never
formulated
any
rule
of
life
to
herself
but
that
which
she
sought
was
joy
primarily
for
herself
and
incidentally
for
other
people
because
unhappy
people
were
disturbing
unless
it
were
possible
to
avoid
them
in
debating
within
herself
the
arguments
which
her
aunt
had
brought
before
her
mind
it
was
that
principle
chiefly
by
which
she
tested
them
to
the
girl
eager
nature
keenly
sensitive
to
pleasure
and
greedy
for
it
the
prospect
so
suddenly
flung
wide
before
her
eyes
was
so
intoxicating
that
again
and
again
as
she
thought
of
it
it
made
her
tremble
and
burn
so
far
as
helen
could
see
at
that
moment
a
marriage
with
this
harrison
would
mean
the
command
of
every
source
of
happiness
and
upon
a
scale
so
magnificent
so
belittling
of
everything
she
had
known
before
that
she
shrank
from
it
as
something
impossible
and
unnatural
again
and
again
she
buried
her
heated
brow
in
her
hands
and
muttered
ought
to
have
known
it
before
i
ought
to
have
had
time
to
realize
that
which
restrained
the
girl
from
welcoming
such
an
opportunity
from
clasping
it
to
her
in
ecstasy
and
flinging
herself
madly
into
the
whirl
of
pleasure
it
held
out
was
not
so
much
her
conscience
and
the
ideals
which
she
had
formed
more
or
less
vaguely
from
the
novels
and
poems
she
had
read
as
the
instinct
of
her
maidenhood
which
made
her
shrink
from
the
thought
of
marriage
with
a
man
whom
she
did
not
love
so
strong
was
this
feeling
in
her
that
at
first
she
felt
that
she
could
not
even
bear
to
be
introduced
to
him
with
such
an
idea
in
her
mind
it
was
aunt
polly
wisdom
and
diplomacy
which
finally
overcame
her
scruples
enough
to
persuade
her
to
that
first
step
helen
kept
thinking
of
her
aunt
words
that
no
one
wanted
to
compel
her
to
marry
the
man
that
she
might
do
just
as
she
chose
she
argued
that
it
was
foolish
to
worry
herself
or
to
be
ill
at
ease
she
might
see
what
sort
of
a
man
he
was
if
he
fell
in
love
with
her
it
would
do
no
harm
helen
was
not
long
in
discovering
by
the
increased
pace
of
her
pulses
that
she
would
find
it
exciting
to
have
everyone
know
that
a
multimillionaire
was
in
love
with
her
for
the
rest
she
said
to
herself
see
when
the
time
comes
and
knew
not
that
one
who
goes
to
front
his
life
temptation
with
that
resolution
is
a
mariner
who
leaves
the
steering
of
his
vessel
to
the
tempest
she
had
stilled
her
objection
by
such
arguments
and
was
just
beginning
to
feel
the
excitement
of
the
prospect
once
more
when
the
maid
knocked
at
the
door
and
asked
to
know
if
mademoiselle
were
ready
to
dress
for
dinner
and
mademoiselle
arose
and
bathed
her
face
and
arms
and
was
once
more
her
old
refreshed
and
rejoicing
self
ready
for
that
mysterious
and
wonderful
process
which
was
to
send
her
out
an
hour
or
two
later
a
vision
of
perfectness
compounded
of
the
hues
of
the
rose
and
the
odors
of
evening
with
the
new
and
unutterable
magic
that
is
all
the
woman
own
besides
the
prospects
her
aunt
had
spoken
of
there
were
reasons
enough
why
helen
should
be
radiant
for
it
was
her
first
recognized
appearance
in
high
society
and
so
she
sat
in
front
of
the
tall
mirror
and
criticised
every
detail
of
the
coiffure
which
the
maid
prepared
and
eyed
by
turns
her
gleaming
neck
and
shoulders
and
the
wonderful
dress
as
yet
unworn
which
shone
from
the
bed
through
its
covering
of
tissue
paper
and
was
all
the
time
so
filled
with
joy
and
delight
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
near
her
soon
aunt
polly
clad
in
plain
black
as
a
sign
that
she
retired
in
favor
of
helen
came
in
to
assist
and
superintend
the
toilet
so
serious
at
the
task
and
so
filled
with
a
sense
of
its
importance
and
the
issues
that
were
staked
upon
it
was
she
and
the
maid
also
that
one
would
not
dare
think
of
the
humor
of
the
situation
if
helen
herself
had
not
broken
the
spell
by
declaring
that
she
felt
like
an
ashantee
warrior
being
decked
out
for
battle
with
plumes
and
war
paint
or
like
rinaldo
or
amadis
donning
his
armor
and
helen
was
in
fact
going
to
war
a
war
for
which
nature
has
been
training
woman
since
the
first
grew
she
carried
a
bow
strong
as
the
one
of
ulysses
which
no
man
could
draw
and
an
arrow
sharp
as
the
sunbeam
and
armed
with
a
barb
for
a
helmet
beside
her
treasure
of
golden
hair
she
wore
one
rose
set
there
with
the
art
that
conceals
art
so
that
it
was
no
longer
a
red
rose
but
one
more
bright
perfection
that
had
come
to
ripeness
about
the
glowing
maiden
her
dress
was
of
the
same
color
a
color
which
when
worn
upon
a
woman
is
a
challenge
crying
abroad
that
here
is
perfection
beyond
envy
and
beyond
praise
when
the
last
touch
was
finished
and
helen
gazed
upon
herself
with
her
bare
shoulders
and
arms
and
her
throat
so
soft
and
white
she
knew
that
she
was
compared
to
all
about
her
a
vision
from
another
world
chiefest
of
all
she
knew
that
neither
arms
and
shoulders
nor
robe
nor
gleaming
hair
would
ever
be
thought
of
when
once
the
face
that
smiled
upon
her
with
its
serene
perfectness
had
caught
the
eye
she
knew
that
as
usual
men
must
start
when
they
saw
her
and
never
take
their
eyes
from
her
the
thought
filled
her
with
an
exulting
consciousness
of
power
and
reared
her
form
with
a
new
dignity
and
made
her
chest
heave
and
her
cheeks
burn
with
yet
a
new
beauty
when
everything
was
ready
aunt
polly
husband
was
called
in
to
gaze
upon
her
a
little
man
was
aunt
polly
husband
with
black
side
whiskers
and
a
head
partly
bald
a
most
quiet
and
unobtrusive
person
looking
just
what
he
had
been
represented
a
sensible
man
who
attended
to
his
half
of
the
family
affairs
and
left
the
other
half
to
his
wife
he
gazed
upon
helen
and
blinked
once
or
twice
as
if
blinded
by
so
much
beauty
and
then
took
the
end
of
her
fingers
very
lightly
in
his
and
pronounced
her
my
dear
he
added
after
seven
so
perhaps
we
best
so
he
led
the
girl
down
to
her
triumph
to
the
handsome
parlors
of
the
house
where
eight
or
ten
men
were
strolling
about
it
was
quite
exciting
to
helen
to
meet
them
for
they
were
all
strangers
and
aunt
polly
had
apparently
considered
harrison
of
so
much
importance
that
she
had
said
nothing
about
the
others
leaving
her
niece
at
liberty
to
make
what
speculations
she
pleased
it
was
a
brilliant
company
which
was
seated
in
the
dining
room
a
short
while
later
as
it
was
assembled
in
helen
honor
aunt
polly
had
taken
care
to
bring
those
who
would
please
the
girl
and
represent
high
life
and
luxury
at
its
best
all
of
the
guests
were
young
and
therefore
perfect
the
members
of
the
set
when
they
have
passed
the
third
decade
are
apt
to
show
signs
of
weariness
a
little
of
their
beauty
and
health
is
gone
and
some
of
their
animation
and
all
of
their
joy
so
that
one
may
be
led
to
ask
himself
if
there
be
not
really
something
wrong
about
their
views
and
ways
of
living
when
they
are
young
however
they
represent
the
possibilities
of
the
human
animal
in
all
things
external
in
some
wonderful
way
known
only
to
themselves
they
have
managed
to
manipulate
the
laws
of
men
so
as
to
make
men
do
for
them
all
the
hard
and
painful
tasks
of
life
so
that
they
have
no
care
but
to
make
themselves
as
beautiful
and
as
clever
and
as
generally
excellent
as
selfishness
can
be
helen
of
course
was
not
in
the
least
troubled
about
the
selfishness
and
she
was
quite
satisfied
with
externals
she
saw
about
her
perfect
toilets
and
perfect
manners
she
saw
everyone
as
happy
as
she
liked
everyone
to
be
and
the
result
was
that
her
spirits
took
fire
and
she
was
clever
and
fascinating
beyond
even
herself
she
carried
everything
before
her
and
performed
the
real
feat
of
dominating
the
table
by
her
beauty
and
cleveness
without
being
either
presumptuous
or
vain
aunt
polly
replied
to
the
delighted
looks
of
her
husband
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
and
the
two
only
wished
that
harrison
had
been
there
then
as
a
matter
of
fact
helen
had
forgotten
harrison
entirely
and
he
did
not
come
back
to
her
mind
until
the
dinner
was
almost
over
when
suddenly
she
heard
the
bell
ring
it
was
just
the
time
that
he
was
due
to
arrive
and
so
she
knew
that
she
would
see
him
in
another
half
hour
in
the
exultation
of
the
present
moment
all
of
her
hesitation
was
gone
and
she
was
as
ready
to
meet
him
as
her
aunt
could
have
wished
when
the
party
rose
a
few
minutes
later
and
went
into
the
parlors
again
helen
was
the
first
to
enter
upon
the
arm
of
her
neighbor
she
was
thinking
of
harrison
and
as
she
glanced
about
her
she
could
not
keep
from
giving
a
slight
start
far
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
she
had
caught
sight
of
the
figure
of
a
man
and
her
first
thought
had
been
that
it
must
be
the
millionaire
his
frail
slender
form
was
more
than
half
concealed
by
the
cushions
of
the
sofa
upon
which
he
was
seated
but
even
so
helen
could
discover
that
he
was
a
slight
cripple
the
man
rose
as
the
party
entered
and
aunt
polly
went
towards
him
she
apparently
expected
her
niece
to
follow
and
be
introduced
to
the
stranger
but
in
the
meantime
the
truth
had
occurred
to
helen
that
it
must
be
the
howard
she
had
been
told
of
she
turned
to
one
side
with
her
partner
and
began
remarking
the
pictures
in
the
room
when
she
found
opportunity
she
glanced
over
and
saw
that
the
man
had
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
and
was
talking
to
roberts
he
looked
as
helen
thought
all
the
invalid
her
aunt
had
described
him
to
be
for
his
face
was
white
and
very
wan
so
that
it
made
her
shudder
me
she
exclaimed
to
herself
do
think
such
a
man
ought
to
go
into
and
she
turned
resolutely
away
and
set
herself
to
the
task
of
forgetting
him
which
she
very
easily
did
a
merry
party
was
soon
gathered
about
her
rejoicing
in
the
glory
of
her
presence
and
listening
to
the
stories
which
she
told
of
her
adventures
in
europe
helen
kept
the
circle
well
in
hand
that
way
and
was
equally
ready
when
one
of
the
young
ladies
turned
the
conversation
off
upon
french
poetry
in
the
hope
of
eclipsing
her
thus
her
animation
continued
without
rest
until
roberts
escorted
one
of
the
guests
to
the
piano
to
sing
for
them
keeping
me
for
harrison
thought
helen
laughing
mischievously
to
herself
i
suppose
she
picked
out
the
worst
musician
first
so
as
to
build
up
a
it
seemed
as
if
that
might
have
been
the
plan
for
a
fact
the
performer
sang
part
of
gluck
perdu
mon
eurydice
in
strange
french
and
in
a
mournful
voice
which
served
very
well
to
display
the
incompatibility
of
the
melody
and
the
words
as
it
happened
however
mistress
helen
heard
not
a
word
of
the
song
for
it
had
scarcely
begun
before
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
doorway
and
caught
sight
of
a
figure
that
drove
all
other
ideas
from
her
mind
harrison
had
come
at
last
he
was
a
tall
dignified
man
and
helen
first
feeling
was
of
relief
to
discover
that
he
was
neither
nor
even
plain
he
had
rather
too
bright
a
complexion
and
rather
too
large
a
sandy
mustache
but
his
clothes
fitted
him
and
he
seemed
to
be
at
ease
as
he
glanced
about
him
and
waited
in
the
doorway
for
the
young
lady
at
the
piano
to
finish
while
the
faint
applause
was
still
sounding
he
entered
with
roberts
moving
slowly
across
the
room
now
thought
helen
for
it
as
she
expected
the
two
came
towards
her
and
harrison
was
presented
helen
who
was
on
the
watch
with
all
her
faculties
decided
that
he
bore
that
trial
tolerably
for
while
his
admiration
of
course
showed
itself
he
did
not
stare
and
he
was
not
embarrassed
am
a
little
late
i
fear
he
said
i
missed
much
of
the
music
said
helen
was
the
first
am
glad
of
that
said
the
other
according
to
the
laws
which
regulate
the
drifting
of
conversation
it
was
next
due
that
helen
should
ask
if
he
were
fond
of
singing
and
then
that
he
should
answer
that
he
was
very
fond
of
it
which
he
did
roberts
tells
me
you
are
a
skillful
musician
he
added
trust
that
i
shall
hear
you
helen
of
course
meant
to
play
and
had
devoted
some
thought
to
the
selection
of
her
program
therefore
she
answered
we
shall
see
by
and
am
told
that
you
have
been
studying
in
germany
was
the
next
observation
you
like
germany
much
said
helen
they
made
me
work
very
hard
at
music
and
at
everything
is
perhaps
why
you
are
a
good
player
said
harrison
ought
to
wait
until
you
hear
me
the
girl
replied
following
his
example
of
choosing
the
most
obvious
thing
to
say
fear
i
am
not
much
of
a
critic
said
the
other
and
so
the
conversation
drifted
on
for
several
minutes
harrison
remarks
being
so
very
uninspiring
that
his
companion
could
find
no
way
to
change
the
subject
to
anything
worth
talking
about
the
girl
thought
during
a
momentary
lull
has
learned
all
the
rules
of
talking
and
that
why
he
at
ease
but
dear
me
what
an
awful
prospect
it
would
kill
me
to
have
to
do
this
often
but
then
to
be
sure
i
sha
see
him
in
the
day
time
and
in
the
evenings
we
should
not
be
at
home
one
does
have
to
be
too
intimate
with
one
husband
i
suppose
and
then
think
said
harrison
your
aunt
is
coming
to
ask
you
to
that
was
aunt
polly
mission
for
a
fact
and
helen
was
much
relieved
for
she
had
found
herself
quite
helpless
to
lift
the
conversation
out
of
the
slough
of
despond
into
which
it
had
fallen
she
wanted
a
little
time
to
collect
her
faculties
and
think
of
something
clever
to
start
with
again
when
in
answer
to
the
request
of
aunt
polly
she
arose
and
went
to
the
piano
the
crushed
feeling
of
course
left
her
and
her
serenity
returned
for
helen
was
at
home
at
the
piano
knowing
that
she
could
do
whatever
she
chose
and
do
it
without
effort
it
was
a
stimulus
to
her
faculties
to
perceive
that
a
general
hush
had
fallen
upon
the
room
and
that
every
eye
was
upon
her
as
she
sat
down
therefore
all
her
old
exultation
was
back
she
paused
a
moment
to
collect
herself
and
gave
one
easy
glance
down
the
room
at
the
groups
of
people
she
caught
a
glimpse
as
she
did
so
of
howard
who
was
still
seated
upon
the
sofa
leaning
forward
and
resting
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
at
another
time
the
sight
of
his
wan
face
might
perhaps
have
annoyed
the
girl
but
she
was
carried
beyond
that
just
then
by
the
excitement
of
the
moment
her
glance
came
back
to
the
piano
and
feeling
that
everyone
was
attentive
and
expectant
she
began
helen
numbered
in
her
repertoire
a
good
many
pieces
that
were
hopelessly
beyond
the
technic
of
the
average
salon
pianist
and
she
had
chosen
the
most
formidable
with
which
to
astonish
her
hearers
that
evening
she
had
her
full
share
of
that
pleasure
which
people
get
from
concerning
themselves
with
great
things
a
pleasure
which
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
reading
and
especially
the
discussing
of
the
world
great
poets
and
which
brings
forth
many
lofty
sentiments
from
the
numerous
class
of
persons
who
combine
idealism
with
vanity
helen
selection
was
the
first
movement
of
the
appassionata
and
she
was
filled
with
a
pleasing
sense
of
majesty
and
importance
as
she
began
she
liked
the
first
theme
especially
because
it
was
striking
and
dignified
and
never
failed
to
attract
attention
and
in
what
followed
there
was
room
for
every
shading
of
tone
from
delicate
softness
that
showed
much
feeling
and
sympathy
to
stunning
fortissimos
that
made
everyone
stare
the
girl
was
relieved
of
any
possible
fear
by
the
certainty
that
the
composition
was
completely
beyond
her
hearers
understanding
and
so
she
soon
lost
herself
in
her
task
and
as
her
excitement
mounted
played
with
splendid
spirit
and
abandon
her
calculations
proved
entirely
well
made
for
when
she
stopped
she
received
a
real
ovation
having
genuinely
astonished
her
hearers
and
she
crossed
the
room
beaming
radiantly
upon
everyone
and
acknowledging
their
compliments
more
assured
of
triumph
than
ever
before
to
cap
the
climax
when
she
reached
her
seat
she
found
harrison
betraying
completely
his
profound
admiration
his
gaze
being
riveted
upon
the
glowing
girl
as
she
sat
down
beside
him
davis
he
said
with
evident
sincerity
was
really
wonderful
you
very
much
said
helen
radiantly
was
the
most
splendid
piano
playing
i
have
ever
heard
in
my
life
the
other
went
on
what
was
it
that
you
played
something
new
no
was
the
answer
is
very
old
said
harrison
old
composers
were
very
great
said
helen
demurely
was
astonished
to
see
with
what
ease
you
played
the
other
continued
yet
so
marvelously
fast
that
must
be
a
fearfully
hard
piece
of
music
to
it
is
said
helen
it
is
quite
exciting
she
added
fanning
herself
and
laughing
helen
was
at
the
top
of
her
being
just
then
and
in
perfect
command
of
things
she
had
no
idea
of
letting
herself
be
dragged
down
into
the
commonplace
again
think
it
about
time
i
was
fascinating
him
she
said
to
herself
and
she
started
in
full
of
merriment
and
life
taking
her
last
remark
as
a
cue
she
told
him
funny
stories
about
the
eccentricities
of
the
sonata
great
composer
how
he
would
storm
and
rage
up
and
down
his
room
like
a
madman
and
how
he
hired
a
boy
to
pump
water
over
his
head
by
the
hour
in
case
of
emergency
harrison
remarked
that
it
was
funny
how
all
musicians
were
such
queer
chaps
but
even
that
did
not
discourage
helen
she
rattled
on
quite
as
supremely
captivating
as
she
had
been
at
the
dinner
table
and
as
she
saw
that
her
companion
was
yielding
to
her
spell
the
color
mounted
to
her
cheeks
and
her
blood
flowed
faster
yet
it
is
of
the
nature
of
such
flame
to
feed
itself
and
helen
grew
the
more
exulting
as
she
perceived
her
success
and
consequently
all
the
more
irresistible
the
eyes
of
the
man
were
soon
riveted
upon
the
gorgeous
vision
of
loveliness
before
him
and
the
contagion
of
the
girl
animation
showed
itself
even
in
him
for
he
brightened
a
little
and
was
clever
enough
to
startle
himself
it
was
a
new
delight
and
stimulus
to
helen
to
perceive
it
and
she
was
soon
swept
away
in
much
the
same
kind
of
nervous
delight
as
her
phantasy
with
the
thunderstorm
the
sofa
upon
which
the
two
were
seated
had
been
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
and
so
they
had
nothing
to
disturb
them
a
short
half
hour
fled
by
during
which
helen
daring
animation
ruled
everything
and
at
the
end
of
which
harrison
was
quite
oblivious
to
everything
about
him
there
were
others
however
who
were
watching
the
affair
the
aunt
polly
was
comprehending
all
with
joy
but
she
was
as
ever
calculating
and
prudent
and
she
knew
that
helen
monopoly
of
harrison
would
soon
become
unpleasantly
conspicuous
especially
as
she
had
so
far
introduced
him
to
no
one
else
she
felt
that
little
would
be
lost
by
breaking
the
spell
for
what
the
girl
was
doing
then
she
might
do
any
time
she
chose
and
so
after
waiting
a
while
longer
she
made
her
way
unobtrusively
over
to
them
and
joined
their
conversation
helen
of
course
understood
her
aunt
meaning
and
acquiesced
she
kept
on
laughing
and
talking
for
a
minute
or
two
more
and
then
at
a
lull
in
the
conversation
she
exclaimed
i
been
keeping
harrison
here
talking
to
me
and
nobody
else
has
seen
anything
of
and
so
harrison
inwardly
anathematizing
the
rest
of
the
company
was
compelled
to
go
through
a
long
series
of
handshakings
and
finally
to
be
drawn
into
a
group
of
young
persons
whose
conversation
seemed
to
him
the
most
inane
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
in
the
meantime
someone
else
was
giving
a
piano
selection
one
which
helen
had
never
heard
but
which
sounded
to
every
one
like
a
finger
exercise
after
her
own
meteoric
flight
the
girl
sat
half
listening
to
it
and
half
waiting
for
her
aunt
to
return
which
roberts
finally
did
beaming
with
gratitude
love
she
whispered
are
an
angel
you
have
done
better
than
i
ever
dreamed
of
and
helen
felt
her
blood
give
a
sudden
leap
that
was
not
quite
pleasant
the
surging
thoughts
that
were
in
her
mind
at
that
moment
brought
back
the
nervous
trembling
she
had
felt
in
the
carriage
so
that
she
leaned
against
the
sofa
for
support
listen
my
dear
the
other
went
swiftly
on
perhaps
divining
the
girl
state
want
you
to
do
a
great
favor
for
not
that
for
you
auntie
asked
helen
weakly
my
dear
that
was
for
yourself
but
this
is
it
want
you
to
come
and
talk
to
my
david
howard
a
little
the
girl
gave
a
start
and
turned
a
little
paler
polly
she
exclaimed
now
he
looks
so
ill
it
makes
me
nervous
even
to
see
helen
my
dear
that
is
nonsense
was
the
reply
howard
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
men
you
ever
met
he
knows
more
than
all
the
people
in
this
room
together
and
you
will
forget
he
is
an
invalid
when
you
have
talked
to
him
a
helen
was
or
wished
to
think
herself
upon
the
heights
of
happiness
just
then
and
she
shrunk
more
than
ever
from
anything
that
was
wretched
now
aunt
polly
she
said
faintly
wait
until
my
dear
said
aunt
polly
is
the
very
time
you
will
wish
to
be
with
harrison
again
soon
and
you
must
meet
howard
for
that
is
what
he
came
suppose
then
i
have
to
said
helen
knitting
her
brows
stroll
over
in
a
minute
or
right
said
the
other
please
try
to
get
acquainted
with
him
helen
for
i
want
you
to
like
will
do
my
best
said
the
girl
wo
talk
about
his
ailments
will
he
said
the
other
laughing
fancy
not
talk
to
him
about
music
he
a
great
musician
you
and
as
her
aunt
left
the
room
helen
stole
a
side
glance
at
the
man
who
was
alone
upon
the
sofa
just
then
his
chin
was
still
resting
in
his
hand
and
he
was
looking
at
helen
as
before
as
she
glanced
at
him
thus
he
seemed
to
be
all
head
or
rather
all
forehead
for
his
brow
was
very
high
and
white
and
was
set
off
by
heavy
black
hair
does
look
interesting
the
girl
thought
as
she
forced
a
smile
and
walked
across
the
room
her
aunt
entered
at
the
same
time
as
if
by
accident
and
the
two
approached
howard
as
he
saw
them
coming
he
rose
with
some
effort
as
helen
noticed
and
with
a
very
slight
look
of
pain
it
cost
her
some
resolution
to
give
the
man
her
hand
in
a
minute
or
two
more
however
they
were
seated
alone
upon
the
sofa
aunt
polly
having
gone
off
with
the
remark
to
helen
that
she
had
made
howard
promise
to
talk
to
her
about
music
and
that
they
both
knew
too
much
about
it
for
her
must
tell
helen
all
about
her
playing
she
added
to
him
laughingly
and
then
helen
to
carry
on
the
conversation
added
should
be
very
much
pleased
if
you
am
afraid
it
is
an
ungracious
task
roberts
has
chosen
me
the
man
answered
smiling
are
not
a
popular
depends
upon
the
critics
said
helen
must
be
is
just
where
they
get
into
trouble
was
the
response
looks
as
if
he
were
going
to
be
chary
with
his
praise
thought
helen
feeling
just
the
least
bit
uncomfortable
she
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
said
not
without
truth
pique
my
curiosity
criticism
could
not
be
technical
said
the
other
smiling
again
i
am
not
a
play
some
other
instrument
asked
helen
afterwards
she
added
mischievously
are
you
just
a
critic
play
the
violin
the
man
answered
are
going
to
play
for
us
this
evening
said
the
other
fear
i
shall
not
helen
inquired
have
not
been
feeling
very
well
was
the
response
i
have
promised
your
aunt
to
play
some
evening
we
had
quite
a
long
do
not
like
to
play
in
public
asked
helen
the
question
was
a
perfectly
natural
one
but
it
happened
unfortunately
that
as
the
girl
asked
it
her
glance
rested
upon
the
figure
of
her
companion
the
man
chanced
to
look
at
her
at
the
same
instant
and
she
saw
in
a
flash
that
her
thought
had
been
misread
helen
colored
with
the
most
painful
mortification
but
howard
gave
to
her
surprise
no
sign
of
offense
not
in
general
he
said
with
simple
dignity
believe
that
i
am
much
better
equipped
as
a
helen
had
never
seen
more
perfect
than
that
and
she
felt
quite
humbled
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
guess
the
age
of
the
man
beside
her
but
helen
noticed
that
his
hair
was
slightly
gray
a
closer
view
had
only
served
to
strengthen
her
first
impression
of
him
that
he
was
all
head
and
she
found
herself
thinking
that
if
that
had
been
all
of
him
he
might
have
been
handsome
tho
in
a
strange
uncomfortable
way
the
broad
forehead
seemed
more
prominent
than
ever
and
the
dark
eyes
seemed
fairly
to
shine
from
beneath
it
the
rest
of
the
face
tho
wan
was
as
powerful
and
massive
as
the
brow
and
seemed
to
helen
little
used
as
she
was
to
think
of
such
things
to
indicate
character
as
well
as
suffering
looks
a
little
like
arthur
she
thought
this
she
had
been
noticing
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
then
because
her
curiosity
had
really
been
piqued
she
brought
back
the
original
topic
again
have
not
told
me
about
my
playing
she
smiled
i
wish
for
your
opinion
i
am
very
vain
you
there
is
wisdom
in
avowing
a
weakness
which
you
wish
others
to
think
you
do
not
possess
gave
me
great
pleasure
to
watch
you
said
the
man
after
a
moment
watch
me
thought
helen
is
a
palpable
evasion
that
is
not
criticising
my
music
itself
she
said
aloud
not
showing
that
she
was
a
trifle
annoyed
have
evidently
been
very
well
taught
said
the
other
well
and
you
have
a
very
considerable
and
helen
was
only
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
evidently
the
man
would
have
liked
to
add
a
to
that
sentence
and
the
girl
felt
as
if
she
had
come
near
an
icicle
in
the
course
of
her
triumph
however
she
was
now
still
more
curious
to
hear
the
rest
of
his
opinion
half
convinced
yet
that
it
must
be
favorable
in
the
end
she
said
should
not
in
the
least
mind
your
speaking
plainly
the
admiration
of
people
who
do
not
understand
music
i
really
do
not
care
and
then
as
howard
fixed
his
deep
clear
eyes
upon
her
helen
involuntarily
lowered
hers
a
little
you
really
want
my
opinion
said
the
other
shall
have
it
but
you
must
remember
that
it
is
yourself
who
leads
me
to
the
bad
taste
of
being
serious
in
that
last
remark
was
in
helen
own
style
and
she
looked
interested
for
the
rest
she
felt
that
she
had
gotten
into
grave
trouble
by
her
question
but
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
now
will
excuse
you
she
said
wish
to
well
then
said
howard
truth
is
that
i
did
not
care
for
your
helen
gave
a
slight
start
that
is
all
the
trouble
i
need
not
worry
she
thought
and
she
added
easily
sonata
is
usually
considered
one
of
beethoven
very
greatest
works
am
aware
of
that
said
the
other
do
you
know
how
beethoven
came
to
compose
it
helen
had
the
happy
feeling
of
a
person
of
moderate
resources
when
the
conversation
turns
to
one
of
his
specialties
she
said
have
read
how
he
said
pocht
das
schicksal
auf
die
pforte
footnote
knocks
fate
upon
the
do
you
understand
that
howard
partly
said
the
other
very
gently
you
and
helen
felt
just
then
that
she
had
made
a
very
awkward
blunder
indeed
is
a
very
dreadful
thing
to
understand
miss
davis
the
other
continued
slowly
one
has
heard
the
knock
he
does
not
forget
it
and
even
the
echo
of
it
makes
him
suppose
then
said
helen
glibly
trying
to
save
herself
you
think
the
sonata
is
too
serious
to
be
played
in
public
exactly
was
the
answer
depends
upon
the
circumstances
there
are
always
three
persons
concerned
you
know
in
this
case
as
you
have
pardoned
me
for
being
serious
there
is
in
the
first
place
the
great
genius
with
his
sacred
message
you
know
how
he
learned
that
his
life
work
was
to
be
ruined
by
deafness
and
how
he
poured
his
agony
and
despair
into
his
greatest
symphony
and
into
this
sonata
that
is
the
first
person
miss
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
helen
took
a
deep
breath
thinking
that
it
was
the
strangest
conversation
she
had
ever
been
called
upon
to
listen
to
during
an
evening
merriment
yet
she
did
not
smile
for
the
man
deep
resonant
voice
fascinated
her
the
second
she
asked
second
said
howard
turning
his
dark
sunken
eyes
full
upon
the
girl
another
man
not
a
genius
but
one
who
has
suffered
i
fear
nearly
as
much
as
one
a
man
who
is
very
hungry
for
beauty
and
very
impatient
of
insincerity
and
who
is
accustomed
to
look
to
the
great
masters
of
art
for
all
his
help
and
helen
felt
very
uncomfortable
indeed
she
said
am
the
said
howard
pianist
is
the
third
it
is
the
pianist
place
to
take
the
great
work
and
live
it
and
study
it
until
he
knows
all
that
it
means
and
then
do
think
i
took
it
quite
so
seriously
as
that
said
helen
with
a
poor
attempt
at
humility
said
howard
gravely
was
made
evident
to
me
that
you
did
not
by
every
note
you
played
for
you
treated
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
liszt
helen
was
of
course
exceedingly
angry
at
those
last
blunt
words
but
she
was
too
proud
to
let
her
vexation
be
observed
she
felt
that
she
had
gotten
herself
into
the
difficulty
by
asking
for
serious
criticism
for
deep
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
it
was
true
and
that
she
would
never
have
dared
to
play
the
sonata
had
she
known
that
a
musician
was
present
helen
felt
completely
humiliated
her
few
minutes
conversation
having
been
enough
to
put
her
out
of
humor
with
herself
and
all
of
her
surroundings
there
was
a
long
silence
in
which
she
had
time
to
think
of
what
she
had
heard
she
felt
in
spite
of
herself
the
folly
of
what
she
had
done
and
her
whole
triumph
had
suddenly
come
to
look
very
small
indeed
yet
as
was
natural
she
felt
only
anger
against
the
man
who
had
broken
the
spell
and
destroyed
her
illusion
she
was
only
the
more
irritated
because
she
could
not
find
any
ground
upon
which
to
blame
him
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
for
her
to
have
carried
on
the
conversation
after
that
fortunately
a
diversion
occurred
the
young
person
who
had
last
played
having
gone
to
the
piano
again
this
time
with
a
young
man
and
a
violin
polly
has
found
someone
to
take
your
place
said
helen
forcing
a
smile
said
the
other
told
me
we
had
another
the
violinist
played
raff
cavatina
a
thing
with
which
fiddlers
all
love
to
exhibit
themselves
he
played
it
just
a
little
off
the
key
at
times
as
helen
might
have
told
by
watching
her
eyebrows
she
in
the
meantime
was
trying
to
recover
her
equanimity
and
to
think
what
else
she
could
say
the
most
uncomfortable
man
i
ever
met
she
thought
with
vexation
wish
i
insisted
upon
keeping
away
from
him
however
helen
was
again
relieved
from
her
plight
by
the
fact
that
as
the
fiddler
stopped
and
the
faint
applause
died
out
she
saw
harrison
coming
towards
her
harrison
had
somehow
succeeded
in
extricating
himself
from
the
difficulty
in
which
his
hostess
had
placed
him
and
had
no
doubt
guessed
that
helen
was
no
better
pleased
with
her
new
companion
i
join
you
he
asked
as
he
neared
the
sofa
said
helen
smiling
she
introduced
the
two
men
and
harrison
sat
down
upon
the
other
side
of
the
girl
somehow
or
other
he
seemed
less
endurable
than
he
had
just
before
for
his
voice
was
not
as
soft
as
howard
and
now
that
animation
was
gone
she
was
again
aware
of
the
millionaire
very
limited
attainments
was
a
very
interesting
thing
we
just
heard
he
said
was
it
do
you
know
helen
answered
that
it
was
raff
cavatina
said
harrison
name
sounds
familiar
i
may
have
heard
it
helen
glanced
nervously
at
howard
but
the
latter
gave
no
sign
howard
is
himself
a
violinist
she
said
must
be
careful
what
criticisms
we
i
do
not
make
any
i
do
not
know
enough
about
it
said
the
other
with
heartiness
which
somehow
seemed
to
helen
to
fail
of
deserving
the
palliating
epithet
of
howard
has
just
been
telling
me
about
my
own
playing
helen
went
on
growing
a
little
desperate
hope
he
admired
it
as
much
as
i
did
said
the
unfortunate
afraid
he
did
said
helen
trying
to
turn
the
matter
into
a
laugh
did
exclaimed
harrison
in
surprise
why
not
he
asked
the
question
of
howard
and
helen
shuddered
for
fear
he
might
begin
with
that
dreadful
are
always
three
persons
concerned
you
but
the
man
merely
said
very
quietly
criticism
was
of
rather
a
technical
nature
sure
for
my
part
i
thought
her
playing
wonderful
said
the
gentleman
from
cincinnati
to
which
the
other
did
not
reply
helen
felt
herself
between
two
fires
and
her
vexation
was
increasing
every
moment
yet
try
as
she
might
she
could
not
think
of
anything
to
change
the
subject
and
it
was
fortunate
that
the
watchful
aunt
polly
was
on
hand
to
save
her
roberts
was
too
diplomatic
a
person
not
to
see
the
unwisdom
of
putting
harrison
in
a
position
where
his
deficiencies
must
be
so
very
apparent
and
so
she
came
over
determined
to
carry
one
of
the
two
men
away
she
was
relieved
of
the
trouble
by
the
fact
that
as
she
came
near
howard
rose
again
with
some
pain
as
it
seemed
to
helen
and
asked
the
girl
to
excuse
him
have
been
feeling
quite
ill
today
he
explained
helen
as
she
saw
him
walk
away
with
roberts
sank
back
with
a
sigh
which
was
only
half
restrained
very
peculiar
person
said
harrison
who
was
clever
enough
to
divine
her
said
the
girl
seemed
to
be
lecturing
you
about
something
from
what
i
saw
added
the
other
the
remark
was
far
from
being
in
the
best
taste
but
it
pleased
helen
because
it
went
to
justify
her
to
herself
and
at
the
same
time
offered
her
an
opportunity
to
vent
her
feelings
she
said
was
about
music
he
was
very
much
displeased
with
exclaimed
harrison
hope
you
do
not
let
that
disturb
you
said
the
girl
laughing
at
any
rate
i
shall
soon
recover
my
equanimity
it
is
very
hard
to
please
a
man
who
plays
himself
you
who
says
he
plays
observed
harrison
play
you
helen
was
pleased
to
fancy
that
there
might
be
wisdom
in
the
remark
us
change
the
subject
she
said
more
cheerfully
is
best
to
forget
things
that
make
one
feel
leave
the
finding
of
a
new
topic
to
you
replied
the
other
with
graciousness
which
did
a
little
more
to
restore
have
a
very
humble
opinion
of
my
own
you
like
mine
the
girl
asked
with
a
laugh
do
indeed
said
harrison
with
equally
pleasing
frankness
was
as
interested
as
could
be
in
the
story
that
you
were
telling
me
when
we
were
we
begin
where
we
left
off
exclaimed
helen
and
felt
as
if
she
had
suddenly
discovered
a
doorway
leading
from
a
prison
she
found
it
easy
to
forget
the
recent
events
after
that
and
harrison
grew
more
tolerable
to
her
every
moment
now
that
the
other
was
gone
her
came
back
to
her
quickly
as
she
read
his
admiration
in
his
eyes
besides
that
it
was
impossible
to
forget
for
very
long
that
harrison
was
a
and
the
object
of
the
envious
glances
of
every
other
girl
in
the
room
and
so
when
aunt
polly
returned
a
while
later
she
found
the
conversation
between
the
two
progressing
very
well
and
in
fact
almost
as
much
enjoyed
by
both
as
it
had
been
the
first
time
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
she
came
to
ask
helen
to
sing
for
the
company
a
treat
which
she
had
reserved
until
the
last
helen
buoyant
nature
had
by
that
time
flung
all
her
doubts
behind
her
and
this
last
excitement
was
all
that
was
needed
to
sweep
her
away
entirely
again
she
went
to
the
piano
as
exulting
as
ever
in
her
command
of
it
and
in
the
homage
which
it
brought
her
she
sang
an
arrangement
of
the
and
she
sang
it
with
all
the
energy
and
enthusiasm
she
possessed
partly
because
she
had
a
really
good
voice
and
enjoyed
the
song
and
partly
because
an
audience
appreciates
singing
more
easily
than
any
other
kind
of
music
she
really
scored
the
success
of
the
evening
everybody
was
as
enthusiastic
as
the
limits
of
good
taste
allowed
and
helen
was
compelled
not
in
the
least
against
her
will
to
sing
again
and
again
while
she
was
laughing
with
happiness
and
triumph
something
brought
back
to
her
mind
and
she
sang
it
again
quite
as
gaily
as
she
had
sung
it
by
the
streamlet
with
arthur
it
was
enough
to
delight
even
the
dullest
and
perhaps
if
howard
had
been
there
even
he
would
have
applauded
a
little
at
any
rate
as
helen
rose
from
the
piano
she
received
a
complete
ovation
everyone
coming
to
her
to
thank
her
and
to
praise
her
and
to
share
in
the
joy
of
her
beauty
she
herself
had
never
been
more
radiant
and
more
exulting
in
all
her
exulting
life
drinking
in
even
harrison
rapturous
compliments
and
finding
nothing
exaggerated
in
them
and
in
the
meantime
aunt
polly
having
suggested
a
waltz
to
close
the
festivities
the
furniture
was
rapidly
moved
to
one
side
and
the
hostess
herself
took
her
seat
at
the
piano
and
struck
up
the
to
the
dance
harrison
who
had
been
at
side
since
her
singing
had
ceased
was
of
course
her
partner
and
the
girl
flushed
and
excited
by
all
the
homage
she
had
received
was
soon
waltzing
delightedly
in
his
arms
the
man
danced
well
fortunately
for
him
and
that
he
was
the
beautiful
girl
ardent
admirer
was
by
this
time
evident
not
only
to
helen
but
to
everyone
else
in
the
mood
that
she
was
then
the
fact
was
as
welcome
to
her
as
it
could
possibly
have
been
and
when
therefore
harrison
kept
her
arm
and
begged
for
the
next
dance
and
the
next
in
turn
helen
was
sufficiently
carried
away
to
have
no
wish
to
refuse
him
when
after
the
third
dance
she
was
tired
out
and
sat
down
to
rest
harrison
was
still
her
companion
helen
was
at
the
very
height
of
her
happiness
then
every
trace
of
her
former
vexation
gone
and
likewise
every
trace
of
her
objections
to
the
man
beside
her
the
music
was
still
sounding
merrily
and
everyone
else
was
dancing
so
that
her
animation
did
not
seem
at
all
out
of
taste
and
so
brilliant
and
fascinating
had
she
become
and
so
completely
enraptured
was
harrison
that
he
would
probably
have
capitulated
then
and
there
if
the
dancing
had
not
ceased
and
the
company
separated
when
it
did
the
end
of
all
the
excitement
was
a
great
disappointment
to
helen
she
was
completely
happy
just
then
and
would
have
gone
just
as
far
as
the
stream
had
carried
her
it
being
her
first
social
experience
was
probably
the
reason
that
she
was
less
easily
wearied
than
the
rest
and
besides
when
one
has
thus
yielded
to
the
sway
of
the
senses
he
dreads
instinctively
the
subsiding
of
the
excitement
and
the
awakening
of
reason
the
awakening
however
is
one
that
must
always
come
helen
having
sent
away
the
maid
suddenly
found
herself
standing
alone
in
the
middle
of
her
own
room
gazing
at
herself
in
the
glass
and
seeing
a
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
the
merry
laughter
of
the
guests
ceased
gradually
and
silence
settled
about
the
halls
of
the
great
house
but
even
then
helen
did
not
move
she
was
standing
there
still
when
her
aunt
came
into
the
room
roberts
was
about
as
excited
as
was
possible
in
a
matron
of
her
age
and
dignity
she
flung
her
arms
rapturously
around
helen
and
clasped
her
to
her
dear
she
cried
was
a
triumph
auntie
said
helen
weakly
dear
child
you
went
on
the
other
laughing
do
believe
you
realize
it
yet
do
you
know
helen
that
harrison
is
madly
in
love
with
you
you
ought
to
be
the
happiest
girl
in
the
land
tonight
auntie
said
helen
again
still
more
weakly
here
my
dear
said
roberts
drawing
her
gently
over
to
the
bed
and
sitting
down
beside
her
are
a
little
dazed
i
fancy
and
i
do
not
blame
you
i
should
have
been
beside
myself
at
your
age
if
such
a
thing
had
happened
to
me
do
you
realize
child
what
a
fortune
like
harrison
is
said
helen
is
very
hard
aunt
polly
i
afraid
about
it
i
must
have
some
time
to
laughed
the
other
queer
child
my
dear
do
you
actually
mean
that
you
could
think
of
refusing
this
chance
of
your
lifetime
do
know
said
helen
trembling
do
think
you
were
crazy
child
i
know
i
should
for
and
she
added
coaxingly
me
tell
you
what
roberts
auntie
sent
you
in
this
message
he
a
great
person
for
doing
generous
things
when
he
takes
it
into
his
head
he
told
me
to
tell
you
that
if
you
accept
harrison
offer
he
would
give
you
the
finest
trousseau
that
he
could
buy
was
that
splendid
of
him
said
helen
him
for
me
and
she
shuddered
talk
to
me
any
more
about
it
now
tho
she
pleaded
do
aunt
polly
i
was
so
excited
and
it
was
all
like
a
dream
and
half
dazed
now
i
ca
think
about
it
and
i
must
think
somehow
it
too
dreadful
sha
think
about
it
tonight
child
laughed
the
other
i
want
you
to
sleep
and
be
beautiful
tomorrow
see
she
added
beginning
to
unfasten
helen
dress
going
to
be
your
little
mother
tonight
and
put
you
to
and
so
soothing
the
girl
and
kissing
her
burning
forehead
and
trying
to
laugh
away
her
fears
her
delighted
protectress
undressed
her
and
did
not
leave
her
until
she
had
seen
her
in
bed
and
kissed
her
again
promise
me
child
she
said
you
wo
worry
yourself
tonight
go
to
sleep
and
you
have
time
to
think
helen
promised
that
she
would
but
she
did
not
keep
her
promise
she
heard
the
great
clock
in
the
hallway
strike
many
times
and
when
the
darkest
hours
of
the
night
had
passed
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
gazing
about
her
at
the
gray
shadows
in
the
room
holding
the
covering
tightly
about
her
because
she
was
very
cold
she
was
muttering
nervously
to
herself
half
deliriously
no
i
will
not
do
it
they
shall
not
me
do
it
i
must
have
time
to
and
when
at
last
she
fell
into
a
restless
slumber
that
thought
was
still
in
her
mind
and
those
words
upon
her
lips
will
not
do
it
i
must
have
time
to
think
music
the
opening
passage
of
beethoven
appassionata
sonata
chapter
vi
yet
methinks
i
see
it
in
thy
face
what
them
shouldst
be
th
occasion
speaks
thee
and
my
strong
imagination
sees
a
crown
dropping
upon
thy
when
helen
awoke
upon
the
following
morning
the
resolution
to
withstand
her
aunt
urging
was
still
strong
within
her
as
she
strove
to
bring
back
the
swift
events
of
the
night
before
the
first
discovery
she
made
was
a
headache
and
a
feeling
of
weariness
and
dissatisfaction
that
was
new
to
her
she
arose
and
looked
in
the
glass
and
seeing
that
she
was
pale
vowed
again
shall
not
torment
me
in
this
way
i
do
not
even
mean
that
he
shall
propose
to
me
i
must
have
time
to
realize
it
and
so
firm
was
she
in
her
own
mind
that
she
rang
the
bell
and
sent
the
maid
to
call
her
aunt
it
was
then
only
nine
in
the
morning
and
helen
presumed
that
neither
roberts
nor
any
of
the
other
guests
would
be
awake
they
not
being
fresh
from
boarding
school
as
she
was
but
the
girl
was
so
nervous
and
restless
and
so
weighed
upon
by
her
urgent
resolution
that
she
felt
she
could
do
nothing
else
until
she
had
declared
it
and
gotten
rid
of
the
matter
going
to
tell
her
once
for
all
she
vowed
shall
not
torment
me
any
it
turned
out
however
that
roberts
had
been
up
and
dressed
a
considerable
time
for
a
reason
which
when
helen
learned
it
prevented
her
delivering
so
quickly
the
speech
she
had
upon
her
mind
she
noticed
a
worried
expression
upon
her
aunt
face
as
soon
as
the
latter
came
into
the
room
is
the
matter
she
asked
in
some
surprise
very
dreadful
misfortune
my
dear
said
roberts
know
how
to
tell
you
you
be
so
put
helen
was
quite
alarmed
as
she
saw
her
aunt
sink
down
into
a
chair
but
then
it
flashed
over
her
that
harrison
might
have
for
some
reason
been
called
away
is
it
tell
me
she
asked
eagerly
howard
my
dear
said
the
other
and
helen
frowned
bother
she
cried
about
him
been
ill
during
the
night
replied
aunt
polly
exclaimed
helen
me
what
a
nuisance
man
said
the
other
deprecatingly
can
not
help
exclaimed
helen
he
ought
not
to
be
here
what
is
the
matter
with
him
do
know
was
the
reply
he
has
been
suffering
so
all
night
that
the
doctor
has
had
to
give
him
an
the
wan
countenance
of
howard
rose
up
before
helen
just
then
and
she
shuddered
inwardly
me
what
a
state
of
affairs
she
exclaimed
seems
to
me
as
if
i
were
to
have
nothing
but
fright
and
worry
why
should
there
be
such
things
in
the
world
do
know
helen
said
the
other
it
is
certainly
inopportune
for
you
of
course
the
company
will
all
have
to
leave
echoed
helen
she
had
never
once
thought
of
that
of
course
said
her
aunt
would
not
be
possible
to
enjoy
ourselves
under
such
very
dreadful
aunt
polly
that
is
a
shame
cried
the
girl
idea
of
so
many
people
being
inconvenienced
for
such
a
cause
ca
he
be
moved
doctor
declares
it
would
be
impossible
at
present
helen
and
it
would
not
look
right
anyway
you
know
he
will
certainly
have
to
remain
until
he
is
how
long
will
that
be
week
or
perhaps
more
was
the
reply
and
helen
saw
that
her
promised
holiday
was
ruined
her
emotions
however
were
not
all
of
disappointment
for
though
she
was
vexed
at
the
interruptions
she
recollected
with
sudden
relief
that
she
could
thus
obtain
and
without
so
much
effort
of
her
own
the
time
to
debate
the
problem
of
harrison
also
there
was
in
her
mind
if
not
exactly
pity
for
the
invalid
at
any
rate
the
nearest
to
it
that
helen
had
ever
learned
to
feel
an
uncomfortable
fright
at
the
idea
of
such
suffering
promise
you
said
aunt
polly
who
had
been
watching
her
face
and
trying
to
read
her
emotions
we
shall
only
postpone
the
good
time
i
meant
to
give
you
you
can
not
possibly
be
more
vexed
about
it
than
i
for
i
was
rejoicing
in
your
triumph
with
not
worrying
on
that
account
said
helen
angrily
dear
said
roberts
pleadingly
can
be
the
matter
with
you
i
think
anyone
who
was
watching
you
and
me
would
get
the
idea
that
i
was
the
one
to
whom
the
fortune
is
coming
i
suppose
that
was
only
one
of
your
jokes
my
dear
but
i
truly
think
you
show
a
realization
of
what
a
tremendous
opportunity
you
have
you
show
much
more
lack
of
experience
than
i
had
any
idea
could
be
is
that
aunt
polly
protested
helen
realize
it
but
i
want
time
to
think
helen
but
what
is
there
to
think
it
seems
to
be
madness
to
trifle
with
such
a
it
be
trifling
to
keep
him
waiting
a
while
asked
helen
laughing
in
spite
of
her
vexation
not
my
dear
but
you
ought
to
know
that
every
other
girl
in
this
house
would
snap
him
up
at
one
second
notice
if
you
only
seen
them
watching
you
last
night
as
i
saw
a
little
was
the
reply
aunt
polly
is
harrison
the
only
man
whom
i
can
find
husband
and
i
have
been
over
the
list
of
our
acquaintances
and
not
found
anyone
that
can
be
compared
with
him
for
an
instant
helen
we
know
of
no
one
that
would
do
for
you
that
has
half
as
much
never
said
do
for
me
said
helen
again
laughing
me
auntie
she
added
is
that
i
not
like
the
fortune
if
i
could
get
it
without
its
attachment
my
dear
you
know
you
can
never
get
any
wealth
except
by
marriage
what
is
the
use
of
talking
such
nonsense
even
in
fun
listen
objected
helen
in
turn
i
do
want
such
a
great
fortune
suppose
i
should
marry
one
of
these
other
men
if
you
only
could
know
as
much
as
i
know
about
these
things
said
roberts
you
only
could
know
the
difference
between
being
in
the
middle
and
at
the
top
of
the
social
ladder
dear
why
will
you
choose
anything
but
the
best
when
you
can
have
the
best
if
you
want
it
i
tell
you
once
for
all
i
do
not
care
how
clever
you
are
or
how
beautiful
you
are
the
great
people
will
look
down
on
you
for
an
upstart
if
you
can
not
match
them
and
make
just
as
much
of
a
show
and
why
can
you
not
discover
what
your
own
tastes
are
i
watched
you
last
night
child
anyone
could
have
seen
that
you
were
in
your
element
you
outshone
everyone
helen
and
you
should
do
just
the
same
all
your
life
can
you
not
see
just
what
that
means
to
you
auntie
said
helen
then
you
not
perfectly
happy
last
night
interrupted
the
other
protested
the
other
just
what
i
was
going
to
only
reason
in
the
world
why
you
are
not
my
dear
is
that
you
were
tormenting
yourself
with
foolish
scruples
can
you
not
see
that
if
you
once
had
the
courage
to
rid
yourself
of
them
it
would
be
all
that
you
need
why
are
you
so
weak
helen
is
not
weak
exclaimed
the
other
asserted
roberts
say
it
is
weak
it
is
weak
of
you
not
to
comprehend
what
your
life
is
to
be
and
what
you
need
for
your
happiness
it
is
a
shame
for
you
to
make
no
use
of
the
glorious
gifts
that
are
yours
and
to
cramp
and
hinder
all
your
own
progress
i
want
you
to
have
room
to
show
your
true
powers
helen
helen
had
been
leaning
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
listening
to
her
aunt
stirred
again
by
all
her
old
emotion
and
angry
with
herself
for
being
stirred
her
unspoken
resolution
was
not
quite
so
steady
as
it
had
been
tho
like
all
good
resolutions
it
remained
in
her
mind
to
torment
her
she
sprang
up
suddenly
with
a
very
nervous
and
forced
laugh
glad
i
do
have
to
argue
with
you
auntie
she
said
that
i
saved
the
trouble
of
worrying
myself
you
see
the
fates
are
on
my
side
i
must
have
time
to
think
whether
i
want
to
or
it
was
that
comfort
which
saved
her
from
further
struggle
with
herself
upon
the
subject
helen
much
preferred
being
happy
to
struggling
she
set
hurriedly
to
work
to
dress
for
her
aunt
told
her
that
the
guests
were
nearly
ready
for
breakfast
could
sleep
since
all
the
excitement
she
said
wonder
it
did
not
wake
was
tired
said
helen
guess
that
was
find
the
breakfast
rather
a
sombre
repast
added
roberts
pathetically
been
up
nearly
three
hours
myself
so
frightened
about
poor
howard
i
had
neveer
seen
anyone
so
dreadfully
ill
and
i
was
quite
certain
he
was
in
his
death
polly
cried
helen
with
a
sudden
wild
start
do
you
talk
like
that
wo
say
any
more
about
it
was
the
reply
hurry
up
and
put
on
your
best
looks
my
dear
for
harrison
to
carry
away
in
his
do
that
much
with
pleasure
was
the
answer
please
have
the
maid
come
up
to
pack
my
trunks
again
for
you
wo
want
me
to
stay
now
of
no
said
roberts
unless
you
want
to
our
house
wo
be
a
very
cheerful
place
i
come
back
in
a
week
or
two
when
you
are
ready
for
me
helen
added
the
meantime
i
can
be
thinking
about
helen
was
soon
on
her
way
downstairs
for
it
was
terrifying
to
her
to
be
alone
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
howard
she
found
a
sombre
gathering
indeed
for
the
guests
spoke
to
each
other
only
in
and
there
were
few
smiles
to
be
seen
helen
found
herself
placed
opposite
harrison
at
the
table
and
she
had
a
chance
to
study
him
by
glances
through
the
meal
well
dressed
anyway
she
mused
he
is
altogether
bad
i
wonder
if
to
marry
after
breakfast
helen
strolled
out
upon
the
piazza
perhaps
with
some
purpose
in
her
mind
for
it
is
not
unpleasant
to
toy
with
a
temptation
even
when
one
means
to
resist
it
at
any
rate
she
was
a
little
excited
when
she
heard
harrison
coming
out
to
join
her
there
a
sad
ending
of
our
little
party
was
it
miss
davis
he
said
answered
the
girl
feel
so
sorry
for
poor
seemed
to
be
rather
ill
last
night
said
the
other
he
was
going
to
add
that
the
fact
perhaps
accounted
for
the
severity
but
he
was
afraid
of
shocking
helen
by
his
levity
a
not
entirely
necessary
precaution
unfortunately
are
going
back
to
town
this
morning
with
the
others
helen
asked
said
harrison
somewhat
to
her
surprise
have
a
different
heavens
does
he
suppose
he
going
to
stay
here
with
me
thought
the
girl
received
your
aunt
permission
to
ask
you
continued
harrison
so
i
need
only
what
helen
inquired
with
varied
emotions
drive
you
over
to
oakdale
with
my
rig
said
the
other
had
it
brought
down
you
know
because
i
thought
there
might
be
a
chance
to
use
helen
had
turned
slightly
paler
and
was
staring
in
front
of
her
you
not
fond
of
driving
then
miss
davis
asked
the
other
as
she
hesitated
said
helen
i
do
like
to
trouble
you
assure
you
it
will
be
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
said
harrison
only
regret
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
see
more
of
you
miss
davis
it
is
only
for
the
present
i
you
said
helen
still
very
faintly
i
have
a
pair
of
horses
that
i
am
rather
proud
of
added
harrison
laughing
should
like
you
to
tell
me
what
you
think
of
them
will
you
give
me
the
pleasure
and
helen
could
not
hesitate
very
much
longer
without
being
rude
you
really
wish
it
harrison
she
said
and
then
someone
else
came
out
on
the
piazza
and
cut
short
the
conversation
helen
had
no
time
to
think
any
more
about
the
matter
but
she
had
a
disagreeable
consciousness
that
her
blood
was
flowing
faster
again
and
that
her
old
agitation
was
back
in
all
its
strength
soon
afterwards
roberts
came
out
and
joined
the
two
davis
has
granted
me
the
very
great
favor
said
harrison
fear
i
shall
be
happier
than
i
ought
to
be
considering
what
suffering
i
leave
will
do
no
good
to
worry
about
it
said
roberts
a
reflection
which
often
keeps
the
world
from
wasting
its
sympathy
shall
have
your
carriage
brought
it
rather
early
to
start
asked
helen
do
know
said
her
aunt
it
can
take
a
little
drive
if
it
is
said
harrison
mean
that
miss
davis
shall
think
a
great
deal
of
my
helen
said
nothing
but
stood
gazing
in
front
of
her
across
the
lawns
her
mind
in
a
tempest
of
emotions
she
could
not
put
away
from
her
the
excitement
that
harrison
presence
brought
the
visions
of
wealth
and
power
which
gleamed
before
her
almost
overwhelmed
her
with
their
vastness
but
she
had
also
the
memory
of
her
morning
resolve
to
trouble
her
conscience
the
result
was
the
same
confused
helplessness
the
dazed
and
frightened
feeling
which
she
so
rebelled
against
do
not
to
be
troubled
in
this
way
she
muttered
angrily
to
herself
again
and
again
wish
to
be
let
alone
so
that
i
can
be
happy
yet
there
was
no
chance
just
then
for
her
to
find
an
peace
or
time
for
further
thought
there
were
half
a
dozen
people
about
her
and
she
was
compelled
to
listen
to
and
answer
commonplace
remarks
about
the
beauty
of
the
country
in
front
of
her
and
about
her
singing
on
the
previous
evening
she
had
to
stifle
her
agitation
as
best
she
could
and
almost
before
she
realized
it
her
aunt
had
come
to
summon
her
to
get
ready
for
the
drive
helen
hoped
to
have
a
moment
quiet
then
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
put
on
her
hat
and
gloves
and
roberts
was
with
her
all
the
time
she
said
pleadingly
as
she
watched
the
girl
surveying
herself
in
the
glass
do
hope
you
will
not
forget
all
that
i
told
wish
you
would
let
me
alone
about
it
cried
helen
very
peevishly
you
only
knew
my
dear
girl
how
much
i
have
done
for
you
replied
the
other
how
i
planned
and
looked
forward
to
this
time
i
do
think
you
answer
me
in
that
is
that
aunt
polly
exclaimed
helen
i
am
so
confused
and
i
do
know
what
to
am
trying
my
poor
humble
best
to
show
you
what
to
think
and
you
could
not
possibly
feel
more
worried
than
i
just
now
helen
you
could
be
rid
of
all
these
doubts
and
struggles
in
one
instant
if
you
chose
ask
yourself
if
it
is
not
true
you
have
only
to
give
yourself
into
the
arms
of
the
happiness
that
calls
you
and
you
never
will
get
rid
of
the
matter
in
any
other
way
indeed
you
will
not
if
you
should
fling
away
this
chance
the
memory
of
it
would
never
leave
you
all
your
life
after
you
knew
it
was
too
late
you
would
torment
yourself
a
thousand
times
more
than
ever
you
can
dear
dear
cried
helen
half
hysterically
ca
stand
that
aunt
polly
i
do
anything
only
let
me
alone
my
head
is
aching
to
split
and
i
do
know
where
i
you
will
never
find
another
chance
like
it
helen
went
on
the
other
with
remorselessness
if
you
behave
in
this
perfectly
insane
way
and
lose
this
opportunity
i
shall
simply
give
you
up
in
despair
at
your
i
have
said
i
was
going
to
lose
it
the
girl
exclaimed
wo
be
any
the
less
in
love
with
me
if
i
make
him
wait
aunt
polly
harrison
was
going
back
to
cincinnati
in
a
day
or
two
put
in
roberts
swiftly
will
stay
if
i
wish
him
to
was
the
girl
reply
is
no
need
for
so
much
worry
one
would
think
i
was
getting
laughed
the
other
are
so
beautiful
this
morning
helen
that
i
could
fall
in
love
with
you
she
turned
the
girl
towards
her
seeing
that
her
toilet
was
finished
have
a
thought
in
the
world
dear
but
to
keep
you
so
beautiful
she
said
hate
to
see
you
tormenting
yourself
and
making
yourself
so
pale
why
will
you
not
take
my
advice
and
fling
all
these
worries
aside
and
let
yourself
be
happy
that
is
all
i
want
you
to
do
and
it
is
so
easy
why
is
it
that
you
do
not
want
to
be
happy
i
like
to
see
you
smile
helen
and
helen
who
was
tired
of
struggling
made
a
wry
attempt
to
oblige
her
and
then
broke
into
a
laugh
at
herself
meanwhile
the
other
picked
a
rose
from
a
great
bunch
of
them
that
lay
upon
the
bureau
and
pinned
it
upon
her
dress
child
she
said
can
never
resist
you
now
i
know
helen
kissed
her
excitedly
upon
the
cheek
and
darted
quickly
out
of
the
door
singing
in
a
brave
attempt
to
bring
back
her
old
merry
self
flowers
that
bloom
in
the
spring
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
a
moment
later
however
she
recollected
howard
and
his
misfortune
and
her
heart
sank
she
ran
quickly
down
the
steps
to
get
the
thought
of
him
from
her
mind
it
was
easy
enough
to
forget
him
and
all
other
troubles
as
well
when
she
was
once
outside
upon
the
piazza
for
there
were
plenty
of
happy
people
and
everyone
crowded
about
her
to
bid
her
there
too
was
harrison
standing
upon
the
steps
waiting
for
her
and
there
was
his
with
two
magnificent
black
horses
alert
and
eager
for
the
sport
helen
was
not
much
of
a
judge
of
horses
having
never
had
one
of
her
own
to
drive
but
she
had
the
eye
of
a
person
of
aristocratic
tastes
for
what
was
in
good
form
and
she
saw
that
harrison
turnout
was
all
of
that
with
another
attraction
for
her
that
it
was
daring
for
the
horses
were
lithe
restless
creatures
thoroughbreds
both
of
them
and
it
looked
as
if
they
had
not
been
out
of
the
stable
in
a
week
they
were
giving
the
groom
who
held
them
all
that
he
could
do
harrison
held
out
his
hand
to
the
girl
as
she
came
down
the
steps
and
eyed
her
keenly
to
see
if
her
flushed
cheeks
would
betray
any
sign
of
fear
but
helen
emotions
were
surging
too
strongly
for
such
thoughts
and
she
had
besides
a
little
of
the
thoroughbred
nature
herself
she
laughed
gaily
as
she
gave
her
hand
to
her
companion
and
sprang
into
the
wagon
he
followed
her
and
as
he
took
the
reins
the
groom
sprang
aside
and
the
two
horses
bounded
away
down
the
broad
avenue
helen
turned
once
to
wave
her
hand
in
answer
to
the
chorus
of
that
sounded
from
the
porch
and
then
she
faced
about
and
sank
back
into
the
seat
and
drank
in
with
delight
the
fresh
morning
breeze
that
blew
in
her
face
i
think
this
is
fine
she
cried
like
driving
then
asked
the
other
indeed
was
the
reply
like
this
kind
ever
so
until
we
get
out
on
the
said
harrison
then
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
i
came
from
the
west
you
know
miss
davis
so
i
think
i
am
wise
on
the
subject
of
the
woods
on
either
side
sped
by
them
and
helen
emotions
soon
began
to
flow
faster
it
was
always
easy
for
her
to
forget
everything
and
lose
herself
in
feelings
of
joy
and
power
and
it
was
especially
easy
when
she
was
as
much
wrought
up
as
she
was
just
then
it
was
again
her
ride
with
the
thunderstorm
and
soon
she
felt
as
if
she
were
being
swept
out
into
the
rejoicing
and
the
victory
once
more
she
might
have
realized
if
she
had
thought
that
her
joy
was
coming
only
because
she
was
following
her
aunt
advice
and
yielding
herself
into
the
arms
of
her
temptation
but
helen
was
thoroughly
tired
of
thinking
she
wanted
to
feel
and
again
and
again
she
drank
in
deep
breaths
of
the
breeze
it
was
only
a
minute
or
so
before
they
passed
the
gates
of
the
roberts
place
and
swept
out
of
the
woods
and
into
the
open
country
it
was
really
inspiring
then
for
harrison
gave
his
horses
the
reins
and
helen
was
compelled
to
hold
on
to
her
hat
he
saw
delight
and
laughter
glowing
in
her
countenance
as
she
watched
the
landscape
that
fled
by
them
with
its
hillsides
clad
in
their
brightest
green
and
with
its
and
snowy
orchards
the
clattering
of
the
horses
hoofs
and
the
whirring
of
the
wheels
in
the
sandy
road
were
music
and
inspiration
such
as
helen
longed
for
and
she
would
have
sung
with
all
her
heart
had
she
been
alone
as
was
her
way
she
talked
instead
with
the
same
animation
and
glow
that
had
fascinated
her
companion
upon
the
previous
evening
she
talked
of
the
sights
that
were
about
them
and
when
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
paused
to
gaze
around
at
the
view
she
told
about
her
trip
through
the
alps
and
pictured
the
scenery
to
him
and
narrated
some
of
her
adventures
and
then
harrison
who
must
have
been
a
dull
man
indeed
not
to
have
felt
the
contagion
of
helen
happiness
told
her
about
his
own
experiences
in
the
rockies
to
which
the
girl
listened
with
genuine
interest
harrison
father
so
he
told
her
had
been
a
of
a
little
town
in
one
of
the
wildest
portions
of
the
mountains
he
himself
had
begun
as
a
railroad
surveyor
and
had
risen
step
by
step
by
constant
exertion
and
watchfulness
it
was
a
story
of
a
man
such
as
helen
had
vowed
to
her
aunt
she
could
not
bear
to
listen
to
yet
she
did
not
find
it
disagreeable
just
then
there
was
an
exciting
story
of
a
race
with
a
rival
road
to
secure
the
right
to
the
best
route
across
the
mountains
helen
found
it
quite
as
exciting
as
music
and
said
so
it
is
a
kind
of
music
said
harrison
laughing
is
the
only
kind
i
have
cared
anything
about
excepting
had
no
idea
people
had
to
work
so
hard
in
the
world
said
helen
dodging
the
compliment
do
unless
they
have
someone
else
to
do
it
for
them
said
the
other
is
a
fierce
race
nowadays
and
a
man
has
to
watch
and
think
every
minute
of
the
time
but
it
is
glorious
to
helen
found
herself
already
a
little
more
in
a
position
to
realize
what
ten
million
dollars
amounted
to
and
very
much
more
respectful
and
in
her
relation
to
them
she
was
sufficiently
oblivious
to
the
flight
of
time
to
be
quite
surprised
when
she
gazed
about
her
and
discovered
that
they
were
within
a
couple
of
miles
of
home
had
no
idea
of
how
quickly
we
were
going
she
said
are
not
tired
then
asked
the
other
indeed
helen
answered
enjoyed
it
ever
so
might
drive
farther
said
harrison
horses
are
hardly
waked
he
reined
them
in
a
little
and
glanced
at
his
watch
just
eleven
he
said
think
there
be
time
and
he
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
you
like
to
have
an
adventure
he
asked
generally
do
replied
the
girl
is
it
was
thinking
of
a
drive
said
the
other
that
we
could
just
about
take
and
return
by
it
is
about
ten
miles
from
is
it
asked
helen
have
just
bought
a
country
place
near
here
said
harrison
thought
perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
aunt
spoke
of
it
helen
answered
eversons
old
said
the
other
know
it
then
only
saw
it
once
in
my
life
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
helen
replied
so
i
have
only
a
dim
recollection
of
its
magnificence
the
old
man
who
lived
there
never
saw
any
had
to
be
sold
because
he
failed
in
business
said
harrison
you
like
to
drive
over
much
said
helen
and
a
minute
later
when
they
came
to
a
fork
in
the
road
they
took
the
one
which
led
them
to
as
the
place
was
called
think
it
a
tremendously
fine
property
myself
said
harrison
made
up
my
mind
to
have
it
the
first
time
i
saw
it
i
seen
anything
around
here
to
equal
it
and
i
hope
to
make
a
real
english
out
of
it
i
tell
you
about
what
i
want
to
do
when
we
get
there
and
you
can
give
me
your
advice
a
man
never
has
good
taste
you
should
like
to
see
it
answered
helen
smiling
have
a
passion
for
fixing
up
had
an
exciting
time
at
the
sale
went
on
harrison
reminiscently
know
everson
family
wanted
to
keep
the
place
themselves
and
the
three
or
four
branches
of
the
family
had
clubbed
together
to
buy
it
when
the
bidding
got
near
the
end
there
was
no
one
left
but
the
family
and
you
got
it
said
helen
cruel
strongest
wins
laughed
the
other
had
made
up
my
mind
to
have
it
the
eversons
are
a
very
aristocratic
family
are
they
said
helen
indeed
they
have
lived
in
this
part
of
the
country
since
the
as
harrison
went
on
to
tell
her
the
story
of
the
sale
she
found
herself
vividly
reminded
of
what
her
aunt
had
told
her
of
the
difference
between
having
a
good
deal
of
money
and
all
the
money
one
wanted
perhaps
also
her
companion
was
not
without
some
such
vaguely
felt
purpose
in
the
telling
at
any
rate
the
girl
was
trembling
inwardly
more
and
more
at
the
prospect
which
was
unfolding
itself
before
her
as
excitement
always
acted
upon
her
as
a
stimulant
she
was
at
her
very
best
during
the
rest
of
the
drive
she
and
her
companion
were
conversing
very
merrily
indeed
when
fairview
was
reached
the
very
beginning
of
the
place
was
imposing
for
there
was
a
high
wall
along
the
roadway
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
then
two
massive
iron
gates
set
in
great
stone
pillars
they
were
opened
by
the
in
response
to
harrison
call
once
inside
the
two
had
a
drive
of
some
distance
through
what
had
once
been
a
handsome
park
though
it
was
a
then
the
road
ascended
somewhat
all
the
way
until
the
end
of
the
forest
was
reached
and
the
first
view
of
the
house
was
gained
helen
could
scarcely
restrain
a
cry
of
pleasure
as
she
saw
it
for
it
was
really
a
magnificent
old
mansion
built
of
gray
stone
and
standing
upon
a
high
plateau
surrounded
by
a
lawn
and
shaded
by
half
a
dozen
great
oaks
below
it
the
lawn
sloped
in
a
broad
terrace
and
in
the
valley
thus
formed
gleamed
a
little
set
off
at
the
back
by
a
hillside
it
splendid
the
girl
exclaimed
gazing
about
her
thought
it
was
rather
good
said
harrison
deprecatingly
can
be
made
much
finer
of
you
take
your
last
year
hay
crop
from
the
lawn
for
one
thing
laughed
she
i
had
no
idea
there
was
anything
so
beautiful
near
our
little
oakdale
just
look
at
that
tremendous
entrance
all
built
in
royal
style
said
harrison
family
must
have
been
wealthy
in
the
old
or
something
of
that
kind
observed
helen
the
house
all
furnished
inside
said
the
other
i
expect
to
do
most
of
it
over
you
like
to
look
he
asked
the
question
as
he
saw
the
coming
up
the
road
presumably
with
the
keys
the
girl
gazed
about
her
dubiously
she
would
have
liked
to
go
in
except
that
she
was
certain
it
would
be
improper
helen
had
never
had
much
respect
for
the
proprieties
however
being
accustomed
to
rely
upon
her
own
opinions
of
things
and
in
the
present
case
besides
she
reflected
that
no
one
would
ever
know
anything
about
it
not
have
time
to
do
more
than
glance
around
continued
the
other
we
might
do
that
if
you
said
helen
after
a
moment
more
of
hesitation
think
i
her
heart
was
beating
very
fast
as
the
two
ascended
the
great
stone
steps
and
as
the
door
opened
before
them
her
mind
could
not
but
be
filled
with
the
overwhelming
thought
that
all
that
she
saw
might
be
hers
if
she
really
wanted
it
the
mere
imagining
of
wealth
had
been
enough
to
make
her
thrill
and
burn
so
it
was
to
be
expected
that
the
actual
presence
of
some
of
it
would
not
fail
of
its
effect
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
great
temptation
took
place
upon
a
high
mountain
where
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
could
really
be
seen
and
helen
as
she
gazed
around
had
the
further
knowledge
that
the
broad
landscape
and
palatial
house
which
to
her
were
almost
too
splendid
to
be
real
were
after
all
but
a
slight
trifle
to
her
companion
the
girl
entered
the
great
hallway
with
its
huge
fireplace
and
its
winding
stairway
and
then
strolled
through
the
parlors
of
the
vast
house
helen
had
in
all
its
fullness
the
woman
passion
for
spending
money
for
beautiful
things
and
it
had
been
her
chief
woe
in
all
her
travels
that
the
furniture
and
pictures
and
tapestry
which
she
gazed
at
with
such
keen
delight
must
be
forever
beyond
her
thoughts
just
at
present
her
fancy
was
turned
loose
and
madly
reveling
in
these
memories
while
always
above
her
wildest
flights
was
the
intoxicating
certainty
that
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
not
all
be
possible
she
could
not
but
recollect
with
a
wondering
smile
that
only
yesterday
she
had
been
happy
at
the
thought
of
arranging
one
dingy
little
parlor
in
her
country
parsonage
and
had
been
trying
to
persuade
her
father
to
the
extravagance
of
two
chairs
it
would
have
been
hard
for
helen
to
keep
her
emotions
from
harrison
and
he
must
have
guessed
the
reason
why
she
was
so
flushed
and
excited
they
were
standing
just
then
in
the
center
of
the
great
with
its
massive
furniture
of
black
mahogany
and
she
was
saying
that
it
ought
to
be
papered
in
dark
red
and
was
conjuring
up
the
effect
to
herself
rich
you
know
to
set
off
the
furniture
she
explained
you
must
take
that
dreadful
portrait
from
over
the
mantel
she
added
laughing
it
was
a
picture
of
a
revolutionary
warrior
on
horseback
and
in
full
uniform
the
coloring
looking
like
faded
oilcloth
had
thought
of
that
myself
said
harrison
the
founder
of
the
eversons
there
a
picture
gallery
in
a
hall
back
of
here
with
two
whole
rows
of
ancestors
in
do
you
adopt
them
asked
helen
mischievously
can
buy
all
the
ancestors
one
wants
to
nowadays
laughed
harrison
thought
i
make
something
more
interesting
out
of
it
i
not
much
of
a
judge
of
art
you
know
but
i
thought
if
i
ever
went
abroad
i
buy
up
some
of
the
great
paintings
that
one
reads
about
some
of
the
old
masters
you
afraid
you
find
very
few
of
them
for
sale
said
helen
smiling
not
accustomed
to
fail
in
buying
things
that
i
want
was
the
other
reply
you
fond
of
pictures
much
indeed
answered
the
girl
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
mere
mention
of
the
subject
opened
a
new
kingdom
to
her
for
she
could
not
count
the
number
of
times
she
had
sat
before
beautiful
pictures
and
almost
wept
at
the
thought
that
she
could
never
own
one
that
was
really
worth
looking
at
brought
home
a
few
myself
she
said
to
her
companion
engravings
you
know
half
a
dozen
that
i
thought
would
please
me
i
mean
to
hang
them
around
my
me
about
it
said
harrison
have
been
thinking
of
fixing
up
such
a
place
myself
you
know
i
thought
of
extending
the
house
on
the
side
that
has
the
fine
view
of
the
valley
and
making
part
a
piazza
and
part
a
conservatory
or
could
be
both
exclaimed
the
girl
eagerly
would
be
the
very
thing
there
ought
not
to
be
anything
in
a
you
know
except
the
piano
and
just
a
few
chairs
and
the
rest
all
flowers
the
pictures
ought
all
to
be
appropriate
pictures
of
nature
of
things
that
dance
and
are
beautiful
oh
i
could
lose
myself
in
such
a
room
as
that
and
helen
ran
on
completely
carried
away
by
the
fancy
and
forgetting
even
harrison
for
a
moment
have
often
dreamed
of
such
a
place
she
said
everything
would
be
sympathetic
it
a
pity
that
one
ca
have
a
piano
taken
out
into
the
fields
the
way
i
remember
reading
that
haydn
used
to
do
with
his
harpsichord
if
i
were
a
violinist
that
the
way
do
all
my
playing
because
then
one
would
not
need
to
be
afraid
to
open
his
eyes
oh
it
would
be
fine
helen
stopped
she
was
at
the
height
of
her
excitement
just
then
and
the
climax
came
a
moment
afterwards
davis
asked
the
man
you
really
like
to
arrange
such
a
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
so
different
that
the
girl
comprehended
instantly
it
was
this
moment
to
which
she
had
been
rushing
with
so
much
exultation
but
when
it
came
her
heart
almost
stopped
beating
and
she
gave
a
choking
gasp
you
really
like
it
asked
harrison
again
bending
towards
her
earnestly
certainly
said
helen
making
one
blind
and
desperate
effort
to
dodge
the
issue
tell
you
everything
that
is
is
not
what
i
mean
miss
davis
echoed
helen
and
she
tried
to
look
at
him
with
her
frank
open
eyes
but
when
she
saw
his
burning
look
she
could
not
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
turned
scarlet
davis
went
on
the
man
rapidly
have
been
waiting
for
a
chance
to
tell
you
this
let
me
tell
you
now
helen
gazed
wildly
about
her
once
as
if
she
would
have
fled
then
she
stood
with
her
arms
lying
helplessly
at
her
sides
trembling
in
every
nerve
is
very
little
pleasure
that
one
can
get
from
such
beautiful
things
alone
miss
davis
and
especially
when
he
is
as
dulled
by
the
world
as
myself
i
thought
that
some
day
i
might
be
able
to
share
them
with
some
one
who
could
enjoy
them
more
than
i
but
i
never
knew
who
that
person
was
until
last
night
i
know
that
i
have
not
much
else
to
offer
you
except
what
wealth
and
position
i
have
gained
and
when
i
think
of
all
your
accomplishments
and
all
that
you
have
to
place
you
so
far
beyond
me
i
almost
fear
to
offer
myself
to
you
but
i
can
only
give
what
i
have
my
humble
admiration
of
your
beauty
and
your
powers
and
the
promise
to
worship
you
to
give
the
rest
of
my
life
to
seeing
that
you
have
everything
in
the
world
that
you
want
i
will
put
all
that
i
own
at
your
command
and
get
as
much
more
as
i
can
with
no
thought
but
of
your
harrison
could
not
have
chosen
words
more
fitted
to
win
the
trembling
girl
beside
him
that
he
should
recognize
as
well
as
she
did
her
superiority
to
him
removed
half
of
his
deficiency
in
her
eyes
davis
the
other
went
on
can
not
know
how
you
will
feel
toward
such
a
promise
but
i
can
not
but
feel
that
what
i
possess
could
give
you
opportunities
of
much
happiness
you
should
have
all
the
beauty
about
you
that
you
wished
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
too
beautiful
for
you
and
you
should
have
every
luxury
that
money
can
buy
to
save
you
from
all
care
if
this
house
seemed
too
small
for
you
you
should
have
another
wherever
you
desired
it
and
be
mistress
of
it
and
of
everything
in
it
and
if
you
cared
for
a
social
career
you
should
have
everything
to
help
you
and
it
would
be
my
one
happiness
to
see
your
triumph
i
would
give
a
thousand
times
what
i
own
to
have
you
for
my
so
the
man
continued
pleading
his
cause
until
at
last
he
stopped
waiting
anxiously
for
a
sign
from
the
girl
he
saw
that
she
was
agitated
for
her
breast
was
heaving
and
her
forehead
flushed
but
he
could
not
tell
the
reason
miss
davis
he
said
humbly
will
scorn
such
things
as
i
have
to
offer
you
tell
me
is
it
that
helen
answered
him
in
a
faint
voice
is
not
that
harrison
it
is
it
is
miss
davis
has
been
but
a
day
i
have
had
no
time
to
know
you
to
love
and
helen
stopped
afraid
at
the
words
she
herself
was
using
for
she
knew
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
stooped
to
a
sham
and
a
lie
her
whole
soul
was
ablaze
with
longing
just
then
with
longing
for
the
power
and
the
happiness
which
this
man
held
out
to
her
and
she
meant
to
take
him
she
had
no
longer
a
thought
of
resistance
it
was
all
the
world
which
offered
itself
to
her
and
she
meant
to
clasp
it
to
her
to
lose
herself
quite
utterly
and
forget
herself
in
it
and
she
was
already
drunk
with
the
thought
therefore
she
could
not
but
shudder
as
she
heard
the
word
upon
her
lips
and
knew
that
she
had
used
it
because
she
wished
to
make
a
show
of
hesitation
did
not
need
but
one
day
miss
davis
went
on
the
other
pleadingly
know
that
i
loved
you
to
know
that
i
no
longer
set
any
value
on
the
things
that
i
had
struggled
all
my
life
to
win
for
you
are
perfect
miss
davis
you
are
so
far
beyond
me
that
i
have
scarcely
the
courage
to
ask
you
what
i
do
but
i
ask
you
and
know
my
he
stopped
again
and
gazed
at
her
and
helen
looked
at
him
wildly
and
then
turned
away
once
more
trembling
she
wished
that
he
would
only
continue
still
longer
for
the
word
was
upon
her
lips
and
yet
it
was
horror
for
her
to
utter
it
because
she
felt
she
ought
not
to
yield
so
soon
because
she
wanted
some
delay
she
sought
for
some
word
that
would
be
an
evasion
that
would
make
him
urge
her
more
strongly
she
wished
to
be
wooed
and
made
to
surrender
and
yet
she
could
find
no
pretext
me
miss
davis
exclaimed
the
other
passionately
what
do
you
wish
me
to
say
asked
helen
faintly
wish
you
to
tell
me
that
you
will
be
my
wife
i
wish
you
to
take
me
for
what
i
can
give
you
for
your
happiness
and
your
glory
i
ask
nothing
else
i
make
no
terms
if
you
will
do
it
it
will
make
me
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
there
is
nothing
else
that
i
care
for
in
and
then
as
the
girl
still
stood
flushed
and
shuddering
hovering
upon
the
verge
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
begged
her
to
reply
must
not
keep
me
in
suspense
he
exclaimed
must
tell
me
tell
and
helen
almost
sinking
answered
him
it
was
such
a
faint
word
that
she
scarcely
heard
it
herself
but
the
other
heard
it
and
trembling
with
delight
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
pressed
a
burning
kiss
upon
her
cheek
the
effect
surprised
him
for
the
fire
which
had
burned
helen
and
inflamed
her
cheeks
had
been
ambition
and
ambition
alone
it
was
the
man
money
that
she
wanted
and
she
was
stirred
with
no
less
horror
than
ever
at
the
thought
of
the
price
to
be
paid
therefore
the
touch
of
his
rough
mustache
upon
her
cheek
acted
upon
her
as
an
electric
contact
and
all
the
shame
in
her
nature
burst
into
flame
she
tore
herself
loose
with
almost
a
scream
no
she
cried
harrison
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
for
a
moment
scarcely
able
to
find
a
word
to
say
davis
he
protested
what
is
the
matter
had
no
right
to
do
that
she
cried
trembling
with
anger
protested
the
other
you
not
just
promised
to
be
my
wife
and
the
words
made
the
girl
turn
white
and
drop
her
eyes
in
fear
yes
she
panted
helplessly
you
should
not
it
is
too
soon
the
other
stood
watching
her
perhaps
divining
a
little
of
the
cause
of
her
agitation
and
feeling
at
any
rate
that
he
could
be
satisfied
for
the
present
with
his
success
he
answered
very
humbly
you
are
right
i
am
very
sorry
for
offending
you
and
stood
silently
waiting
until
the
girl
emotions
had
subsided
a
little
and
she
had
looked
at
him
again
will
pardon
me
he
asked
yes
she
said
weakly
you
will
not
forget
the
promise
you
have
made
me
she
answered
and
then
she
gazed
anxiously
toward
the
door
us
go
she
said
imploringly
is
all
so
hard
for
me
to
realize
and
i
feel
so
very
the
two
went
slowly
down
the
hallway
harrison
not
even
venturing
to
offer
her
his
arm
outside
they
stood
for
a
minute
upon
the
high
steps
helen
leaning
against
a
pillar
and
breathing
very
hard
she
dared
not
raise
her
eyes
to
the
man
beside
her
wish
to
go
now
he
asked
gently
please
she
replied
think
so
it
is
very
helen
scarcely
knew
what
happened
during
the
drive
home
for
she
passed
it
in
a
condition
almost
overwhelmed
by
what
she
had
done
she
answered
mechanically
to
all
harrison
remarks
about
his
arrangements
of
the
house
and
his
plans
elsewhere
but
all
reference
to
his
wealth
seemed
powerless
to
waken
in
her
a
trace
of
the
exultation
that
had
swept
her
away
before
while
every
allusion
to
their
personal
relationship
was
like
the
touch
of
fire
her
companion
seemed
to
divine
the
fact
and
again
he
begged
her
anxiously
not
to
forget
the
promise
she
had
given
helen
answered
faintly
that
she
would
not
but
the
words
were
hard
for
her
to
say
and
it
was
an
infinite
relief
to
her
to
see
oakdale
again
and
to
feel
that
the
strain
would
soon
be
over
for
the
time
at
any
rate
shall
stay
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
said
harrison
will
let
me
see
you
often
helen
will
you
not
answered
helen
mechanically
will
come
said
the
other
take
you
driving
if
you
like
i
promised
to
go
back
and
lunch
with
your
aunt
as
i
thought
i
was
to
return
to
the
in
a
moment
more
the
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
helen
home
and
the
girl
without
waiting
for
anyone
to
assist
her
leaped
out
and
with
a
hasty
word
of
parting
ran
into
the
house
she
heard
the
horses
trotting
away
and
then
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
she
stood
in
the
dark
silent
hallway
she
saw
no
one
and
after
gazing
about
her
for
a
moment
she
stole
into
her
little
and
flung
herself
down
upon
the
couch
where
she
lay
with
her
head
buried
in
her
hands
it
was
a
long
time
afterwards
when
she
glanced
up
again
she
was
trembling
all
over
and
her
face
was
white
heaven
name
how
can
i
have
done
it
she
whispered
hoarsely
to
herself
can
i
have
done
it
and
what
i
to
do
now
nur
wer
der
minne
macht
nur
wer

vii
kommt
dass
du
so
traurig
bist
da
alles
froh
erscheint
man
sieht

an
gewiss
du
hast
helen
might
have
spent
the
afternoon
in
that
situation
tormenting
herself
with
the
doubts
and
fears
that
filled
her
mind
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
her
presence
was
discovered
by
elizabeth
the
servant
who
came
in
to
clean
the
room
the
latter
of
course
was
astonished
to
see
her
but
helen
was
in
no
mood
to
vouchsafe
explanations
leave
me
alone
she
said
do
not
feel
very
well
and
tell
father
i
am
here
father
miss
helen
exclaimed
the
woman
you
get
his
letter
letter
and
then
poor
helen
was
made
aware
of
another
trouble
davis
wrote
roberts
last
night
answered
the
servant
gone
cried
the
girl
to
new
then
the
woman
went
on
to
explain
that
davis
had
been
invited
to
take
the
place
of
a
friend
who
was
ill
and
had
left
oakdale
for
a
week
helen
understood
that
the
letter
must
have
reached
her
aunt
after
her
own
departure
me
the
girl
exclaimed
unfortunate
i
do
want
to
stay
here
but
afterwards
it
flashed
over
her
that
if
she
did
she
might
be
able
to
have
a
week
of
quiet
to
regain
her
harrison
could
expect
to
visit
me
if
i
were
alone
she
thought
then
i
suppose
he
could
too
she
added
hastily
i
am
engaged
to
him
and
i
could
never
stand
that
helen
said
the
servant
who
had
been
standing
and
watching
her
anxiously
look
very
ill
is
anything
the
matter
helen
answered
i
want
to
rest
leave
me
alone
please
you
going
to
stay
the
other
asked
must
fix
up
your
have
to
stay
said
helen
nothing
else
to
you
had
lunch
yet
but
i
do
want
any
just
let
me
be
helen
expected
the
woman
to
protest
but
she
did
not
she
turned
away
and
the
girl
sank
back
upon
the
couch
and
covered
her
face
again
has
gone
wrong
she
groaned
to
herself
know
i
shall
die
of
despair
i
do
want
to
be
here
all
alone
with
harrison
coming
here
dear
me
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
him
and
helen
nervous
impatience
grew
upon
her
until
she
could
stand
it
no
more
and
she
sprang
up
and
began
pacing
swiftly
up
and
down
the
room
she
was
still
doing
that
when
she
heard
a
step
in
the
hall
and
saw
the
faithful
servant
in
the
doorway
with
a
tray
of
luncheon
elizabeth
asked
no
questions
about
matters
that
did
not
concern
her
but
she
regarded
this
as
her
province
and
she
would
pay
no
attention
to
helen
protests
be
ill
if
you
do
eat
she
vowed
look
paler
than
i
ever
saw
and
so
the
girl
sat
down
to
attempt
to
please
her
elizabeth
standing
by
and
talking
to
her
in
the
meantime
but
helen
was
so
wrapped
up
in
her
own
thoughts
that
she
scarcely
heard
a
word
until
the
woman
chanced
to
ask
one
question
you
hear
about
arthur
and
helen
gazed
up
at
her
about
him
she
said
what
about
him
very
ill
said
elizabeth
helen
gave
a
start
she
gasped
said
elizabeth
thought
you
must
know
davis
was
over
to
see
him
is
the
matter
doctor
said
he
must
have
been
fearfully
run
down
and
he
was
out
in
the
storm
and
caught
a
cold
and
he
been
in
a
very
bad
way
delirious
and
unconscious
by
turns
for
two
or
three
helen
was
staring
at
the
servant
in
a
dumb
fright
me
elizabeth
she
cried
scarcely
able
to
say
the
words
is
not
dangerously
ill
danger
is
over
now
the
other
answered
the
doctor
said
or
else
davis
would
never
have
left
but
he
in
a
bad
way
and
it
may
be
some
time
before
he
up
perhaps
it
was
the
girl
overwrought
condition
that
made
her
more
easily
alarmed
just
then
for
she
was
trembling
all
over
as
she
heard
those
words
she
had
forgotten
arthur
almost
entirely
during
the
past
two
days
and
he
came
back
to
her
at
that
moment
as
another
thorn
in
her
conscience
davis
said
he
wrote
you
to
go
and
see
him
went
on
the
servant
you
miss
helen
i
do
know
said
helen
faintly
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
knew
that
she
almost
certainly
would
go
to
see
arthur
after
what
had
just
passed
even
to
have
him
find
out
about
it
was
something
of
which
she
simply
could
not
think
she
felt
dread
enough
at
having
to
tell
her
father
of
what
had
occurred
with
harrison
and
to
see
arthur
even
though
he
did
not
know
about
it
she
knew
was
not
in
her
power
i
ought
not
to
have
told
you
about
it
until
after
you
had
had
your
lunch
you
are
not
eating
anything
miss
do
want
anything
said
helen
mournfully
it
now
please
elizabeth
and
please
do
not
trouble
me
any
more
i
have
a
great
deal
to
worry
when
the
woman
had
left
the
room
helen
shut
the
door
and
then
sat
down
on
a
chair
staring
blankly
before
her
there
was
a
mirror
just
across
the
room
and
her
own
image
caught
her
eye
startling
her
by
its
pale
and
haggard
look
me
it
dreadful
she
cried
aloud
springing
up
i
let
people
trouble
me
in
this
way
i
ca
help
arthur
and
i
could
have
helped
him
in
the
beginning
it
every
bit
of
it
his
own
fault
and
i
do
see
why
i
should
let
it
make
me
and
the
same
with
the
other
thing
i
could
have
been
happy
without
all
that
wealth
if
i
never
seen
it
and
now
i
know
i
never
be
happy
again
oh
i
know
it
and
helen
began
once
more
pacing
up
and
down
never
was
this
way
before
in
my
life
she
cried
with
increasing
vexation
i
wo
have
it
she
clenched
her
hands
angrily
struggling
within
herself
to
shake
off
what
was
tormenting
her
but
she
might
as
well
have
tried
to
shake
off
a
mountain
from
her
shoulders
hers
had
been
none
of
the
stern
experience
that
gives
power
and
command
to
the
character
and
of
the
kind
of
energy
that
she
needed
she
had
none
and
not
even
a
thought
of
it
she
tried
only
to
forget
her
troubles
in
some
of
her
old
pleasures
and
when
she
found
that
she
could
not
read
and
that
the
music
she
tried
to
play
sounded
hollow
and
meaningless
she
could
only
fling
herself
down
upon
the
sofa
with
a
moan
there
realizing
her
own
impotence
she
sank
into
dull
despair
unable
any
longer
to
realize
the
difficulties
which
troubled
her
and
with
only
one
certainty
in
her
mind
that
she
was
more
lost
and
helpless
than
she
had
ever
thought
it
possible
for
her
to
be
time
is
not
a
thing
of
much
consequence
under
such
circumstances
and
it
was
a
couple
of
hours
before
helen
was
aroused
she
heard
a
carriage
stop
at
the
door
and
sprang
up
in
alarm
with
the
thought
that
it
might
be
harrison
but
as
she
stood
trembling
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
heard
a
voice
inquiring
for
her
and
recognized
it
as
that
of
her
aunt
a
moment
later
roberts
rushed
into
the
room
and
catching
sight
of
helen
flung
her
arms
eagerly
about
her
dear
girl
she
cried
harrison
has
just
told
me
about
what
has
happened
and
then
as
she
read
her
niece
state
of
mind
in
her
countenance
she
added
expected
to
find
you
rejoicing
helen
what
is
the
matter
in
point
of
fact
the
woman
had
known
pretty
well
just
how
she
would
find
helen
and
having
no
idea
of
leaving
her
to
her
own
tormenting
fancies
she
had
driven
over
the
moment
she
had
finished
her
lunch
received
your
father
letter
she
said
without
waiting
for
helen
to
answer
her
i
came
right
over
to
take
you
take
me
back
echoed
helen
my
dear
you
do
suppose
i
mean
to
leave
you
here
all
alone
by
yourself
do
you
and
especially
at
such
a
time
as
this
when
harrison
wants
to
see
you
aunt
polly
protested
helen
do
want
to
see
him
want
to
see
him
why
my
dear
girl
you
have
promised
to
be
his
wife
roberts
saw
helen
shudder
slightly
and
so
she
went
on
quickly
is
going
to
stay
at
the
hotel
in
the
village
you
wo
find
it
the
same
as
being
in
the
house
with
him
but
i
do
assure
you
child
there
never
was
a
man
more
madly
in
love
than
he
auntie
dear
that
howard
too
protested
helen
trembling
will
not
interfere
with
you
for
he
never
makes
any
noise
and
you
not
know
he
there
of
course
you
wo
play
the
piano
but
you
can
do
anything
else
you
choose
and
harrison
will
probably
take
you
driving
every
then
seeing
how
agitated
helen
was
her
aunt
put
her
arms
around
her
again
and
led
her
to
the
sofa
helen
she
said
do
blame
you
for
being
nervous
i
know
just
how
you
feel
my
aunt
polly
moaned
the
girl
am
so
wretched
know
laughed
aunt
polly
the
idea
of
having
to
marry
him
i
suppose
i
felt
the
very
same
way
when
i
was
in
your
place
but
you
find
that
wears
off
very
quickly
you
get
used
to
seeing
him
and
besides
you
know
that
you
to
marry
him
if
you
want
any
of
the
other
happiness
and
roberts
stopped
and
gazed
about
her
for
instance
my
dear
she
went
on
having
to
be
content
with
this
dingy
little
room
after
having
seen
that
magnificent
place
of
his
do
you
know
helen
dear
that
i
really
envy
you
and
it
seems
quite
ridiculous
to
come
over
here
and
find
you
moping
around
one
would
think
you
were
a
hermit
and
did
not
care
anything
about
do
care
about
it
said
the
other
i
love
beautiful
things
and
all
but
aunt
polly
i
ca
help
thinking
it
dreadful
to
have
to
and
learn
to
like
harrison
said
the
other
cheerfully
you
are
really
too
weak
to
ruin
your
peace
of
mind
in
this
way
for
you
could
see
if
you
chose
that
all
your
troubles
are
of
your
own
making
and
that
if
you
were
really
determined
to
be
happy
you
could
do
it
why
do
you
dear
do
know
protested
the
girl
faintly
i
am
weak
but
i
ca
help
course
not
laughed
the
other
you
spend
your
afternoons
shut
up
in
a
room
like
this
when
you
come
with
me
you
wo
be
able
to
do
that
way
and
i
tell
you
you
find
nothing
like
having
social
duties
and
an
appearance
to
maintain
in
the
world
to
keep
one
cheerful
if
you
did
have
me
at
your
elbow
i
really
believe
you
go
all
to
fear
i
should
said
the
girl
but
she
could
not
help
laughing
as
she
allowed
herself
to
be
led
upstairs
and
to
have
the
dust
bathed
from
her
face
and
the
wrinkles
smoothed
from
her
brow
in
the
meantime
her
diplomatic
aunt
was
unobtrusively
dropping
as
many
hints
as
she
could
think
of
to
stir
helen
to
a
sense
of
the
fact
that
she
had
suddenly
become
a
person
of
consequence
and
whether
it
was
these
hints
or
merely
the
reaction
natural
to
helen
it
is
certain
that
she
was
much
calmer
when
she
went
down
to
the
carriage
and
much
more
disposed
to
resign
herself
to
meeting
harrison
again
and
roberts
was
correspondingly
glad
that
she
had
been
foreseeing
enough
to
come
and
carry
her
away
she
had
great
confidence
in
her
ability
to
keep
helen
from
foolish
worrying
and
to
interest
her
in
the
great
future
that
was
before
her
then
it
just
as
well
that
she
should
be
at
my
house
where
she
can
find
the
comfort
that
she
loves
she
reflected
can
see
that
she
learns
to
love
it
more
every
the
great
thing
of
course
was
to
keep
her
ambition
as
much
awake
as
possible
and
so
during
the
drive
home
roberts
conversation
was
of
the
excitement
which
the
announcement
of
helen
engagement
would
create
in
the
social
world
and
of
the
brilliant
triumph
which
the
rest
of
her
life
would
be
and
of
the
vast
preparations
which
she
was
to
make
for
it
the
trousseau
soon
came
in
for
mention
then
and
what
woman
could
have
been
indifferent
to
a
trousseau
even
for
a
marriage
which
she
dreaded
after
that
the
conversation
was
no
longer
a
task
for
helen
animation
never
failed
to
build
itself
up
when
it
was
once
awake
she
was
so
pleased
and
eager
that
the
drive
was
over
before
she
knew
it
and
before
she
had
had
time
for
even
one
unpleasant
thought
about
meeting
harrison
it
proved
not
to
be
a
difficult
task
after
all
for
harrison
was
quiet
and
dignified
and
even
a
little
reserved
as
helen
thought
so
that
it
occurred
to
her
that
perhaps
he
was
offended
at
the
vehemence
with
which
she
had
repelled
him
she
did
not
know
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
perhaps
it
might
have
been
his
right
to
embrace
her
after
she
had
promised
to
marry
him
the
thought
made
her
shudder
yet
she
felt
sure
that
if
she
had
asked
her
aunt
she
would
have
learned
that
she
was
very
much
in
the
wrong
indeed
conscience
was
very
restless
just
at
that
time
and
it
was
pleasant
to
be
able
to
lull
it
by
being
a
little
more
gracious
and
kind
to
her
ardent
lover
the
latter
of
course
responded
joyfully
so
that
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
passed
quite
pleasantly
when
roberts
arrived
and
had
been
acquainted
with
the
tidings
he
of
course
sought
the
first
opportunity
to
see
the
girl
and
to
congratulate
her
upon
her
wonderful
fortune
helen
had
always
found
in
her
uncle
a
grave
person
who
treated
her
with
indifference
and
therefore
inspired
her
with
awe
it
was
not
a
little
stirring
to
her
vanity
to
find
that
she
was
now
a
person
of
sufficient
consequence
to
reverse
the
relation
this
fact
did
yet
a
little
more
to
make
her
realize
the
vastness
of
her
sudden
conquest
and
so
throughout
dinner
she
was
almost
as
exulting
in
her
own
heart
as
she
had
been
at
the
same
time
on
the
previous
day
her
animation
mounted
throughout
the
evening
for
harrison
and
her
aunt
talked
of
the
future
of
endless
trips
abroad
and
of
palatial
houses
and
royal
entertainments
at
home
until
the
girl
was
completely
dazed
afterwards
when
she
and
harrison
were
left
alone
helen
fascinated
her
companion
as
completely
as
ever
and
was
radiant
herself
and
rejoicing
as
if
to
cap
the
climax
harrison
broached
the
subject
of
a
trip
to
new
york
to
see
if
she
could
find
anything
at
the
various
picture
dealers
to
suit
her
music
room
and
also
of
a
visit
to
fairview
to
meet
an
architect
and
discuss
her
plan
there
the
girl
went
up
to
her
room
just
as
completely
full
of
exultation
as
she
had
been
upon
the
night
before
yet
more
comfortable
in
the
conviction
that
there
would
be
no
repetition
of
that
night
worry
yet
even
as
the
thought
occurred
to
her
it
made
her
tremble
and
as
if
some
fiend
had
arranged
it
especially
for
her
torment
as
she
passed
down
the
hall
a
nurse
came
silently
out
of
one
of
the
rooms
and
through
the
half
open
doorway
helen
fancied
that
she
heard
a
low
moan
she
shuddered
and
darted
into
her
own
room
and
locked
the
door
yet
that
did
not
exclude
the
image
of
the
sufferer
or
keep
it
from
suggesting
a
train
of
thought
that
plunged
the
girl
into
misery
it
made
her
think
of
arthur
and
of
the
haggard
look
that
had
been
upon
his
face
when
he
left
her
and
all
helen
angry
assertions
that
it
was
not
her
fault
could
not
keep
her
from
tormenting
herself
after
that
always
the
fact
was
before
her
that
however
sick
he
might
be
even
dying
she
could
never
bear
to
see
him
again
and
so
arthur
became
the
embodiment
of
her
awakening
conscience
the
result
was
that
the
girl
slept
very
little
that
night
spending
half
of
it
in
fact
alternately
sitting
in
a
chair
and
pacing
the
room
in
agitation
striving
in
vain
to
find
some
gleam
of
light
to
guide
her
out
of
the
mazes
in
which
she
was
lost
the
gray
dawn
found
her
tossing
feverishly
about
upon
her
pillow
yearning
for
the
time
when
she
had
been
happy
and
upbraiding
herself
for
having
been
drawn
into
her
present
trouble
when
she
arose
later
on
she
was
more
pale
and
wearied
than
she
had
been
upon
the
morning
before
then
she
had
at
least
possessed
a
resolution
while
this
time
she
was
only
helpless
and
despairing
thus
her
aunt
found
her
when
she
came
in
to
greet
her
and
the
dismay
of
the
worthy
matron
may
be
imagined
however
being
an
indefatigable
little
body
she
set
bravely
to
work
again
first
of
all
by
rebuking
the
girl
for
her
weakness
she
managed
to
rouse
her
to
effort
once
more
and
then
by
urging
the
necessity
of
seeing
people
and
of
hiding
her
weakness
she
managed
to
obtain
at
last
a
semblance
of
cheerfulness
in
the
meantime
roberts
was
helping
her
to
dress
and
to
remove
all
traces
of
her
unhappiness
so
that
when
helen
descended
to
breakfast
she
had
received
her
first
lesson
in
one
of
the
chief
tasks
of
the
social
regime
many
in
the
silent
night
have
wept
their
grief
away
and
in
the
morn
you
fancy
their
hearts
were
ever
and
helen
played
her
part
so
well
that
roberts
was
much
encouraged
and
beamed
upon
her
across
the
table
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
her
natural
happiness
was
not
all
crushed
and
because
playing
a
part
was
not
easy
to
the
girl
she
was
very
soon
interested
in
the
various
plans
that
were
being
discussed
when
harrison
called
later
on
and
proposed
a
drive
she
accepted
with
genuine
pleasure
to
be
sure
she
found
it
a
trifle
less
thrilling
than
on
the
day
before
for
the
novelty
was
gone
but
that
fact
did
not
cause
her
much
worry
in
all
her
anticipations
of
the
pleasure
before
her
it
had
occurred
to
her
as
little
as
it
occurs
to
others
in
her
situation
to
investigate
the
laws
of
the
senses
through
which
the
pleasure
is
to
be
obtained
there
is
a
whole
moral
philosophy
to
be
extracted
from
the
little
word
by
those
who
know
but
helen
was
not
of
the
knowing
she
believed
that
when
she
was
tired
of
the
horses
she
could
delight
herself
with
her
beautiful
house
and
that
when
she
was
tired
of
the
house
she
could
have
a
new
one
all
her
life
she
had
been
deriving
ecstasy
from
beautiful
things
from
dresses
and
flowers
and
books
and
music
and
pictures
and
of
course
it
was
only
necessary
to
have
an
infinite
quantity
of
such
things
in
order
to
be
infinitely
happy
the
way
to
have
the
infinite
quantity
was
to
marry
harrison
or
at
any
rate
that
was
view
and
she
was
becoming
more
and
more
irritated
because
it
did
not
work
well
in
practice
and
more
and
more
convinced
that
her
aunt
must
be
right
in
blaming
her
weakness
in
the
meantime
being
in
the
open
air
and
among
all
the
things
that
she
loved
she
was
bound
to
rejoice
once
more
and
rejoice
she
did
not
even
allowing
herself
to
be
hindered
by
harrison
too
obvious
failures
to
comprehend
her
best
remarks
helen
argued
that
she
was
not
engaged
to
the
man
because
of
his
cleverness
and
that
when
she
had
come
to
the
infinite
happiness
towards
which
she
was
traveling
so
fast
she
would
have
inspiration
enough
for
two
she
had
enough
for
the
present
to
keep
them
both
happy
throughout
the
drive
and
when
she
returned
she
found
that
some
of
the
neighbors
had
driven
over
to
see
her
and
to
increase
her
excitement
by
their
congratulations
the
machiavellian
aunt
polly
had
told
the
news
to
several
friends
on
the
day
before
knowing
full
well
that
it
would
spread
during
the
night
and
that
helen
would
have
her
first
taste
of
triumph
the
next
day
and
so
it
continued
and
exactly
as
on
the
night
before
the
feverish
excitement
swept
helen
on
until
the
bedtime
hour
arrived
then
she
went
up
into
her
room
alone
to
wrestle
with
the
same
dreadful
specter
as
before
the
story
of
that
day
was
the
story
of
all
that
followed
helen
was
destined
to
find
that
she
might
sweep
herself
away
upon
the
wings
of
her
ambition
as
often
as
she
chose
and
revel
all
she
pleased
in
the
thought
of
harrison
wealth
but
when
the
excitement
was
over
and
she
came
to
be
all
alone
she
could
think
only
of
the
one
dreadful
fact
of
the
necessity
of
marrying
him
she
was
paying
a
faustus
price
for
her
happiness
and
in
the
night
time
the
price
stared
at
her
and
turned
all
her
happiness
to
misery
a
state
of
mind
such
as
this
was
so
alien
to
helen
that
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
if
she
had
sunk
into
it
without
protest
and
rebellion
as
day
after
day
passed
and
the
misery
continued
her
dissatisfaction
with
everything
about
her
built
itself
into
a
climax
more
and
more
plainly
she
was
coming
to
see
the
widening
of
the
gulf
between
the
phantom
she
was
pursuing
and
the
place
where
she
stood
finally
there
came
one
day
nearly
a
week
after
her
engagement
when
helen
was
so
exhausted
and
so
wretched
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
remain
in
her
room
and
had
withstood
all
her
aunt
attempts
to
dissuade
her
she
had
passed
the
morning
in
bed
between
equally
vain
attempts
to
become
interested
in
a
book
and
to
make
up
for
the
sleep
she
had
missed
during
the
night
and
was
just
about
giving
up
both
in
despair
when
the
maid
entered
to
say
that
elizabeth
wished
to
see
her
helen
gave
a
start
for
she
knew
that
something
must
be
wrong
when
the
woman
entered
she
asked
breathlessly
what
it
was
about
arthur
was
the
hurried
reply
and
helen
turned
paler
than
ever
and
clutched
the
bedclothing
in
her
trembling
hands
is
it
she
cried
you
know
miss
helen
said
elizabeth
father
wrote
me
to
go
and
see
him
whenever
i
could
and
i
just
come
from
there
this
how
is
he
looked
dreadful
but
he
had
gotten
up
and
he
was
sitting
by
the
window
when
i
came
in
he
was
hardly
a
shadow
of
helen
was
trembling
have
not
been
to
see
him
asked
the
woman
said
helen
faintly
and
then
she
stopped
not
elizabeth
inquired
anxiously
did
not
ask
for
me
did
he
asked
the
girl
scarcely
able
to
utter
the
words
said
the
woman
you
know
everybody
told
me
you
were
engaged
to
a
rich
man
and
helen
started
forwrard
with
a
cry
she
gasped
you
did
said
the
other
told
and
then
seeing
the
girl
look
of
terror
she
stopped
short
helen
stared
at
her
for
fully
half
a
minute
without
uttering
a
word
and
then
the
woman
went
on
slowly
was
very
dreadful
miss
helen
he
went
almost
crazy
and
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
did
know
what
i
should
do
please
tell
me
what
is
the
helen
was
still
gazing
dumbly
at
the
woman
seeming
not
to
have
heard
the
last
question
i
ca
tell
you
she
said
when
it
was
repeated
again
ought
not
to
have
told
him
helen
cried
the
woman
anxiously
do
something
for
i
am
sure
that
i
know
what
is
the
matter
he
loves
you
and
you
must
know
it
too
and
it
will
certainly
kill
him
weak
as
he
was
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
and
i
could
not
find
him
anywhere
miss
helen
you
go
and
see
him
the
girl
sat
with
the
same
look
of
helpless
fright
upon
her
face
and
with
her
hands
clenched
tightly
between
her
knees
the
other
went
on
talking
hurriedly
but
helen
scarcely
heard
anything
after
that
her
mind
was
too
full
of
its
own
thoughts
it
was
several
minutes
more
before
she
even
noticed
that
the
woman
was
still
insisting
that
she
must
go
to
see
artheur
leave
me
now
she
cried
wildly
leave
me
i
can
not
explain
anything
i
want
to
be
alone
and
when
the
door
was
shut
she
became
once
more
dumb
and
motionless
staring
blankly
ahead
of
her
a
helpless
victim
of
her
own
wretched
thoughts
is
the
end
of
it
she
groaned
to
herself
that
is
the
end
of
it
winkt

viii
thou
be

endlessly
happy
or
endlessly
wretched
helen
was
quite
powerless
to
do
anything
whatever
after
that
last
piece
of
misfortune
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
have
remained
just
where
she
was
for
hours
shuddering
at
the
sight
of
what
was
happening
yet
utterly
helpless
before
it
the
world
was
taking
a
very
serious
aspect
indeed
to
the
bright
and
laughing
girl
who
had
thought
of
it
as
the
home
of
birds
and
flowers
yet
she
knew
not
what
to
make
of
the
change
or
how
she
was
to
blame
for
it
and
she
could
only
sit
still
and
tremble
she
was
in
the
same
position
and
the
same
state
of
mind
when
her
aunt
entered
the
room
some
minutes
later
roberts
stood
watching
her
silently
and
then
as
helen
turned
her
gaze
of
pleading
misery
upon
her
she
came
forward
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
by
the
bedside
and
fixed
her
keen
eyes
upon
the
girl
aunt
polly
cried
helen
am
i
to
do
i
am
so
wretched
have
just
been
talking
to
elizabeth
said
roberts
with
some
sternness
she
been
telling
you
about
arthur
is
that
what
is
the
matter
with
you
helen
was
the
trembling
response
can
i
do
me
helen
in
the
first
place
demanded
the
other
you
saw
arthur
that
day
in
the
woods
what
did
you
do
did
you
make
him
any
promises
you
hold
out
any
hopes
to
him
did
you
say
anything
to
him
at
all
about
love
i
told
him
it
was
impossible
said
helen
eagerly
clutching
at
that
little
crumb
of
comfort
in
heaven
name
child
cried
the
other
in
amazement
is
the
matter
with
you
if
arthur
chooses
to
carry
on
in
this
fashion
why
in
the
world
should
you
punish
yourself
in
this
horrible
way
what
is
the
matter
with
you
helen
are
you
responsible
to
him
for
your
marriage
i
do
know
which
is
the
most
absurd
the
boy
behavior
or
your
worrying
about
auntie
stammered
the
girl
is
so
ill
he
might
die
bosh
exclaimed
roberts
frightened
elizabeth
by
his
ravings
it
is
the
most
absurd
nonsense
he
a
penniless
and
the
lord
only
knows
what
besides
i
only
wish
i
been
there
to
talk
to
him
for
i
do
think
he
have
frightened
me
what
in
the
world
do
you
suppose
he
wants
anyway
is
he
mad
enough
to
expect
you
to
marry
him
do
know
aunt
polly
said
helen
weakly
never
have
believed
that
arthur
could
be
capable
of
anything
so
preposterous
as
this
behavior
vowed
roberts
then
to
come
up
here
and
find
you
wearing
yourself
to
a
skeleton
about
it
is
only
that
auntie
protested
helen
is
so
much
else
i
am
miserable
said
the
other
grimly
see
it
as
well
as
you
and
just
about
as
much
reason
in
any
of
it
as
in
the
matter
of
then
roberts
moved
her
chair
nearer
and
after
gazing
at
helen
for
a
moment
began
again
been
meaning
to
say
something
to
you
and
it
might
just
as
well
be
said
now
for
all
this
matter
is
coming
to
a
climax
helen
it
ca
go
on
this
way
very
much
longer
for
you
kill
yourself
it
got
to
be
settled
one
way
or
the
other
once
and
for
and
roberts
stopped
and
took
a
deep
breath
preparing
for
one
more
struggle
helen
still
gazed
at
her
helplessly
not
going
to
say
anything
more
about
arthur
declared
the
woman
you
choose
to
torment
yourself
about
such
absurdities
i
ca
help
it
arthur
behavior
is
not
the
least
your
fault
and
you
know
it
but
all
the
other
trouble
is
your
fault
and
nobody
else
to
blame
for
the
question
is
just
as
simple
as
the
day
helen
and
you
must
see
it
and
decide
it
you
got
to
choose
between
one
of
two
things
either
to
marry
harrison
or
to
give
him
up
and
there
no
excuse
for
your
hesitating
and
tormenting
yourself
one
day
then
the
indomitable
woman
set
to
work
at
her
old
task
of
conjuring
up
before
the
girl
eyes
all
the
allurements
that
had
so
often
made
her
heart
throb
she
pictured
fairview
and
all
its
luxuries
and
the
admiration
and
power
that
must
be
hers
when
she
was
mistress
of
it
and
she
mentioned
every
other
source
of
pleasure
that
she
knew
would
stir
helen
eager
thirst
after
having
hammered
away
at
that
theme
until
she
saw
signs
of
the
effect
she
desired
she
turned
to
the
other
side
of
the
picture
she
demanded
it
really
possible
for
you
to
think
of
giving
up
these
things
and
going
back
to
live
in
that
miserable
little
house
at
oakdale
can
you
not
see
that
you
would
be
simply
burying
yourself
alive
you
might
just
as
well
be
as
ugly
as
those
horrible
nelson
girls
across
the
way
helen
you
you
belong
to
a
different
station
in
life
than
those
people
you
know
you
have
a
right
to
some
of
the
beautiful
things
in
the
world
and
you
know
that
after
this
vision
of
everything
perfect
that
you
have
seen
you
can
never
possibly
be
happy
in
your
ignorant
girlish
way
again
you
have
promised
harrison
to
marry
him
and
made
him
go
to
all
the
expense
that
he
has
and
you
told
everybody
you
know
and
all
the
world
is
talking
about
your
triumph
and
you
had
roberts
go
to
all
the
trouble
he
has
about
your
trousseau
surely
helen
you
can
not
dream
of
changing
your
mind
and
giving
all
this
up
it
is
ridiculous
to
talk
about
do
want
to
give
it
up
protested
the
girl
moaning
oh
i
ca
know
exclaimed
the
other
heard
all
that
a
thousand
times
do
you
see
helen
that
you
simply
to
marry
him
there
is
no
other
possibility
to
think
of
and
all
of
your
weakness
is
that
you
do
perceive
that
fact
and
make
up
your
mind
to
it
just
see
how
absurd
you
are
to
make
yourself
ill
in
this
i
ca
help
it
auntie
indeed
i
ca
could
help
it
if
you
wanted
to
vowed
the
other
am
quite
disgusted
with
you
i
have
told
you
a
thousand
times
that
this
is
all
an
imaginary
terror
that
you
are
conjuring
up
for
yourself
to
ruin
your
health
and
happiness
when
you
have
married
him
you
will
see
that
it
just
as
i
tell
you
and
you
laugh
at
yourself
for
feeling
as
you
it
in
the
meantime
aunt
polly
it
having
to
think
about
it
that
frightens
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
said
roberts
i
found
that
i
could
cure
myself
of
such
weakness
as
this
sooner
than
let
it
ruin
my
life
and
make
everyone
about
me
wretched
i
settle
the
matter
right
now
and
forever
i
marry
him
within
a
week
helen
and
the
resolute
little
woman
clenched
her
hands
grimly
i
would
she
exclaimed
if
i
found
i
had
strength
enough
to
hold
my
resolution
i
marry
him
and
be
an
end
to
it
do
realize
helen
how
you
treat
harrison
she
went
on
as
the
girl
shuddered
how
patient
he
is
you
not
find
many
men
like
him
in
that
respect
my
dear
for
he
madly
in
love
with
you
and
you
treat
him
as
coldly
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
i
can
see
that
for
i
watch
you
and
i
can
see
how
it
offends
him
you
have
promised
to
be
his
wife
helen
and
yet
you
behave
in
this
ridiculous
way
you
are
making
yourself
ill
and
you
look
years
older
every
day
yet
you
make
not
the
least
attempt
to
conquer
so
she
went
on
and
helen
began
to
feel
more
and
more
that
she
was
doing
a
very
great
wrong
indeed
roberts
sharp
questioning
finally
drew
from
her
the
story
of
her
reception
of
one
kiss
and
helen
was
made
to
seem
quite
ridiculous
and
even
rude
in
her
own
eyes
her
aunt
lectured
her
with
such
unaccustomed
sternness
that
she
was
completely
frightened
and
came
to
look
upon
her
action
as
the
cause
of
all
the
rest
of
her
misery
precisely
on
that
account
that
you
still
regard
him
as
a
stranger
roberts
vowed
course
he
makes
no
more
advances
and
you
might
go
on
forever
in
that
helen
promised
that
the
next
time
she
was
alone
with
harrison
she
would
apologize
for
her
rudeness
and
treat
him
in
a
different
manner
wish
roberts
went
on
i
could
only
make
you
see
as
plainly
as
i
see
helen
how
very
absurd
your
conduct
is
day
by
day
you
are
filling
your
mind
with
the
thought
of
the
triumph
that
is
to
be
yours
so
that
it
takes
hold
of
you
and
becomes
all
your
life
to
you
and
all
the
time
you
know
that
to
possess
it
there
is
one
thing
which
you
have
got
to
do
and
instead
of
realizing
the
fact
and
reconciling
yourself
to
it
you
sit
down
and
torment
yourself
as
if
you
were
a
creature
without
reason
or
will
can
you
not
see
that
you
must
be
wretched
i
see
said
helen
weakly
see
it
but
you
make
no
effort
to
do
anything
else
you
make
me
almost
give
you
up
in
despair
you
will
not
see
that
this
weakness
has
only
to
be
conquered
once
and
that
then
your
life
can
be
happy
auntie
dear
exclaimed
helen
is
so
hard
in
life
would
be
hard
for
a
person
who
had
no
more
resolution
than
you
responded
the
other
you
know
nothing
about
the
world
you
fancy
you
are
doing
something
very
unusual
and
dreadful
but
i
assure
you
it
what
every
girl
has
to
do
when
she
marries
in
society
and
there
no
one
of
them
but
would
laugh
at
your
behavior
you
just
give
harrison
up
and
see
how
long
it
would
be
before
somebody
else
would
take
him
oh
child
how
i
wish
i
could
give
you
a
little
of
my
energy
you
would
go
to
the
life
that
is
before
you
in
a
very
different
way
i
promise
you
for
really
the
only
way
that
you
can
have
any
happiness
in
the
world
is
to
be
strong
and
take
it
and
if
you
once
had
a
purpose
and
some
determination
you
would
feel
like
a
different
person
make
up
your
mind
what
you
wish
to
do
helen
and
go
and
do
it
and
take
hold
of
yourself
and
master
yourself
and
show
what
you
are
made
of
aunt
polly
was
quite
sublime
as
she
delivered
that
little
exordium
and
to
the
girl
anxious
as
she
was
for
her
old
strength
and
happiness
the
words
were
like
music
they
made
her
blood
flow
again
and
there
was
a
light
in
her
eyes
auntie
she
said
try
echoed
the
other
comes
of
all
your
trying
you
have
been
reveling
for
a
week
in
visions
of
what
is
to
be
yours
and
that
ought
surely
to
have
been
enough
time
for
you
to
make
up
your
mind
and
yet
every
time
that
i
find
you
alone
all
your
resolution
is
gone
you
simply
have
no
strength
helen
i
will
have
it
cried
the
girl
do
mean
to
do
this
way
any
more
i
never
saw
it
so
see
it
now
because
i
talking
to
you
and
you
always
do
see
it
then
but
i
should
think
the
very
terror
of
what
you
have
suffered
would
serve
as
a
motive
and
make
you
quite
desperate
can
you
not
see
that
your
very
safety
depends
upon
your
taking
this
resolution
and
keeping
it
and
not
letting
go
of
it
no
matter
what
happens
from
what
i
seen
of
you
helen
i
know
that
if
you
do
not
summon
all
your
energies
together
and
fling
aside
every
purpose
but
this
and
act
upon
it
while
you
feel
it
so
keenly
you
will
surely
fail
for
anybody
can
withstand
a
temptation
for
a
while
when
his
mind
is
made
up
all
the
trouble
is
in
keeping
it
made
up
for
a
long
time
i
tell
you
if
i
found
i
was
losing
sooner
than
surrender
i
would
do
anything
absolutely
anything
roberts
had
many
more
words
of
that
heroic
kind
she
was
a
vigorous
little
body
and
she
was
quite
on
fire
with
enthusiasm
just
then
and
with
zeal
for
the
consummation
of
the
great
triumph
perhaps
there
is
no
occupation
of
men
quite
without
its
poetry
and
even
a
society
leader
may
attain
to
the
sublime
in
her
devotion
to
life
as
she
sees
it
besides
that
the
woman
was
exalted
to
eloquence
just
then
by
a
feeling
that
she
was
nearer
her
goal
than
ever
before
and
that
she
had
only
to
spur
helen
on
and
keep
her
in
her
present
glow
to
clinch
the
matter
for
the
girl
was
very
much
excited
indeed
and
showed
both
by
what
she
said
and
by
the
change
in
her
behavior
that
she
was
determined
to
have
an
end
to
her
own
wretchedness
and
to
conquer
her
shrinking
from
her
future
husband
at
any
cost
during
all
the
time
that
she
was
dressing
her
aunt
was
stirring
her
resolution
with
the
same
appeal
so
that
helen
felt
that
she
had
never
seen
her
course
so
clearly
before
or
had
so
much
resolution
to
follow
it
she
spread
out
her
arms
and
drank
deep
breaths
of
relief
because
she
was
free
from
her
misery
and
knew
how
to
keep
so
and
at
the
same
time
because
she
still
felt
tremblings
of
fear
she
clenched
her
hands
in
grim
earnestness
when
she
was
ready
to
descend
she
was
flushed
and
trembling
with
excitement
and
quite
full
of
her
resolution
wo
have
to
go
very
far
roberts
mused
the
man
is
madly
in
love
with
want
you
to
look
as
beautiful
as
you
can
dear
she
said
aloud
by
way
of
changing
the
subject
harrison
there
be
another
visitor
at
lunch
stranger
echoed
helen
remember
dear
when
i
told
you
of
howard
i
spoke
of
a
third
person
who
was
coming
lieutenant
maynard
yes
said
the
girl
he
here
until
the
late
train
this
evening
answered
the
other
got
his
leave
as
he
expected
but
of
course
he
did
want
to
come
while
howard
was
so
helen
remembered
with
a
start
having
heard
someone
say
that
howard
was
better
she
cried
wo
be
at
lunch
will
he
i
do
want
to
see
wo
dear
was
the
reply
doctor
said
he
could
leave
his
room
but
it
will
be
afterwards
when
you
have
gone
driving
with
will
he
leave
soon
asked
helen
shuddering
the
mention
of
the
invalid
name
had
instantly
brought
to
her
mind
the
thought
of
arthur
will
leave
i
presume
he
probably
knows
he
has
caused
us
trouble
enough
answered
roberts
and
then
reading
thought
and
seeing
a
sign
upon
her
face
of
the
old
worry
she
made
haste
to
lead
her
down
the
stairs
helen
found
harrison
in
conversation
with
a
tall
man
in
naval
uniform
to
whom
she
was
introduced
by
her
aunt
the
girl
saw
that
the
officer
admired
her
which
was
only
another
stimulant
to
her
energies
so
that
she
was
at
her
cleverest
during
the
meal
that
followed
she
accepted
the
invitation
of
harrison
to
go
with
him
to
fairview
during
the
afternoon
and
after
having
been
in
her
room
all
the
morning
she
was
looking
forward
to
the
drive
with
no
little
pleasure
as
also
to
the
meeting
with
the
architect
whom
harrison
said
would
be
there
it
seemed
once
as
if
the
plan
were
to
be
interrupted
and
as
if
her
excitement
and
resolution
were
to
come
to
naught
for
a
telegram
arrived
for
harrison
and
he
announced
that
he
was
called
away
to
new
york
upon
some
business
but
as
it
proved
this
was
only
another
circumstance
to
urge
her
on
in
carrying
out
her
defiant
resolution
for
harrison
added
that
he
would
not
have
to
leave
until
the
evening
and
her
aunt
gazed
at
the
girl
significantly
to
remind
her
of
how
little
time
there
was
helen
felt
her
heart
give
a
sudden
leap
and
felt
a
disagreeable
trembling
seize
upon
her
her
animation
became
more
feverish
yet
in
consequence
after
the
luncheon
when
she
ran
up
for
her
hat
and
gloves
her
aunt
followed
her
but
helen
shook
her
off
with
a
laughing
assurance
that
everything
would
be
all
right
and
then
ran
out
into
the
hallway
she
did
not
go
on
however
for
something
that
she
saw
caused
her
to
spring
quickly
back
and
turn
pale
is
it
whispered
her
aunt
as
helen
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
replied
the
girl
shuddering
was
the
unfortunate
invalid
who
was
passing
down
the
hallway
upon
the
arm
of
lieutenant
maynard
helen
shook
her
head
at
all
her
aunt
laughing
protests
and
could
not
be
induced
to
leave
the
room
until
the
two
had
passed
on
then
she
ran
down
and
leaving
the
house
by
another
door
sprang
into
the
carriage
with
harrison
and
was
whirled
away
waving
a
laughing
to
her
aunt
the
fresh
air
and
the
swift
motion
soon
completed
the
reaction
from
helen
morning
unhappiness
and
as
generally
happened
when
she
was
much
excited
her
imagination
carried
her
away
in
one
of
her
wild
flights
of
joy
so
that
her
companion
was
as
much
lost
as
ever
in
admiration
and
delight
helen
told
him
countless
stories
and
made
countless
witticisms
and
darted
a
great
many
mischievous
glances
which
were
comprehended
much
better
when
they
had
passed
within
the
gates
of
fairview
being
on
private
land
she
felt
even
less
need
of
restraint
and
sang
theure
halle
gruss
ich
wieder
and
laughed
at
her
own
cleverness
quite
as
much
as
if
her
companion
had
understood
it
all
after
that
it
was
a
new
delight
to
discover
that
work
was
progressing
rapidly
upon
the
trimming
of
the
forest
and
the
turning
of
the
road
into
a
broad
avenue
likewise
the
was
in
and
the
lawn
plowed
and
raked
and
ready
for
grass
seed
and
the
undesirable
part
of
the
old
furniture
carted
away
all
of
which
things
helen
knew
had
been
done
according
to
her
commands
and
scarcely
had
all
this
been
appreciated
properly
before
the
architect
arrived
helen
was
pleased
with
him
because
for
one
thing
he
was
evidently
very
much
impressed
by
her
beauty
and
for
another
because
he
entered
so
understandingly
into
all
her
ideas
he
and
the
girl
spent
a
couple
of
the
happiest
hours
in
discussing
the
details
of
the
wonderful
music
room
a
thing
which
seemed
to
her
more
full
of
delightful
possibilities
than
any
other
in
all
her
radiant
future
it
was
a
sort
of
a
child
dream
to
her
with
a
fairy
godmother
to
make
it
real
and
her
imagination
ran
riot
in
a
vision
of
banks
of
flowers
and
of
paintings
of
all
things
that
embody
the
joys
of
music
the
that
haunt
thought
at
night
the
whole
was
to
be
illuminated
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
these
verisimilitude
and
in
the
daytime
it
would
be
no
less
beautiful
because
it
was
to
be
almost
all
glass
upon
two
sides
helen
was
rejoiced
that
the
architect
realized
the
importance
of
the
fact
that
music
room
ought
to
be
out
of
doors
and
then
as
she
made
the
further
welcome
discovery
that
the
moon
would
shine
into
it
she
vowed
eagerly
that
there
would
be
no
lights
at
all
in
her
music
room
at
those
times
afterwards
she
told
a
funny
story
of
how
schumann
had
been
wont
to
improvise
under
such
circumstances
until
his
neighbor
was
so
struck
by
the
romance
of
it
that
he
proceeded
to
imitate
it
and
to
play
somebody
or
other
technical
studies
whenever
the
moon
rose
at
which
narrative
helen
and
the
architect
laughed
very
heartily
and
harrison
with
them
though
he
would
not
have
known
the
difference
between
a
technical
study
and
the
altogether
helen
was
about
as
happy
as
ever
throughout
that
afternoon
tho
one
who
watched
her
closely
might
have
thought
there
was
something
nervous
about
her
animation
especially
later
on
when
the
talk
with
the
architect
was
nearing
its
end
helen
eyes
had
once
or
twice
wandered
uneasily
about
the
room
and
when
finally
the
man
rose
to
leave
she
asked
him
with
a
sudden
desperate
resolution
to
look
over
the
rest
of
the
rooms
and
see
what
he
thought
of
her
suggestions
the
latter
expressed
himself
as
pleased
to
oblige
her
but
he
would
probably
have
been
somewhat
chagrined
had
he
known
how
little
helen
really
attended
to
his
remarks
her
mind
was
in
a
whirl
and
all
that
he
said
sounded
distant
and
vague
her
one
wish
was
that
he
might
stay
and
give
her
time
to
think
but
helen
found
the
uselessness
of
shrinking
and
the
time
came
at
last
when
she
saw
to
her
despair
that
there
was
no
more
to
say
and
that
the
man
must
go
in
a
few
minutes
more
he
was
actually
gone
and
she
was
left
all
alone
in
the
great
house
with
harrison
the
two
went
back
into
the
dining
room
where
harrison
stood
leaning
his
hand
upon
the
table
and
helen
stood
in
front
of
him
her
lips
trembling
twice
she
made
a
faint
attempt
to
speak
and
then
she
turned
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
in
agitation
harrison
was
watching
her
seeing
that
there
was
something
on
her
mind
and
also
that
her
emotion
made
her
more
beautiful
and
more
disturbing
to
him
than
ever
at
last
helen
went
and
sat
down
upon
a
sofa
at
one
side
and
clenching
her
hands
very
tightly
about
her
knees
looked
up
at
him
and
said
in
a
faint
voice
had
something
to
say
to
you
then
she
stopped
and
her
eyes
fell
and
her
breath
came
very
hard
is
it
dear
asked
harrison
gently
and
helen
lips
trembled
more
than
ever
and
her
voice
sank
still
lower
as
she
said
i
do
know
how
to
the
other
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
more
after
which
he
came
slowly
across
the
room
and
sat
down
beside
her
he
said
had
something
to
say
to
you
also
suppose
i
say
it
first
the
girl
chest
was
heaving
painfully
and
her
heart
throbbing
violently
but
she
gazed
into
his
eyes
and
smiled
and
answered
him
he
took
one
of
her
burning
hands
in
his
and
she
made
no
resistance
dear
he
said
you
remember
it
was
nearly
a
week
ago
that
we
stood
in
this
same
room
and
that
you
promised
to
be
my
wife
you
were
very
cold
to
me
then
i
have
been
waiting
patiently
for
you
to
change
a
little
not
venturing
to
say
anything
for
fear
of
offending
you
but
it
is
very
hard
he
had
bent
forward
pleadingly
and
his
face
was
very
close
to
hers
trying
to
read
her
heart
perhaps
it
was
well
that
he
could
not
for
it
would
have
frightened
him
the
moment
was
one
of
fearful
suffering
for
helen
tho
there
was
no
sign
of
it
except
that
she
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
and
that
her
lips
were
white
there
was
just
a
moment
of
suspense
and
then
with
a
cruel
effort
she
mastered
herself
and
gazed
up
at
the
man
a
smile
forcing
itself
to
her
lips
again
is
it
that
you
wish
she
asked
want
you
to
care
for
me
the
other
said
love
me
just
a
little
helen
will
you
i
think
so
was
the
reply
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
and
harrison
pressed
her
hand
in
his
and
bent
forward
eagerly
i
may
kiss
you
dear
he
asked
will
not
mind
and
helen
bowed
her
head
and
answered
in
this
same
instant
as
she
sank
forward
the
man
clasped
her
in
his
arms
he
pressed
her
upon
his
bosom
and
covered
her
cheeks
and
forehead
with
his
passionate
burning
kisses
helen
crushed
and
helpless
in
his
grasp
felt
a
revulsion
of
feeling
so
sudden
and
so
overwhelming
that
it
was
an
agony
to
her
and
she
almost
screamed
aloud
she
was
choking
and
shuddering
and
her
cheeks
were
on
fire
while
in
the
meantime
harrison
almost
beside
himself
with
passion
pressed
her
tighter
to
him
and
poured
out
his
protestations
of
devotion
helen
bore
it
until
she
was
almost
mad
with
the
emotion
that
had
rushed
over
her
and
then
she
made
a
wild
effort
to
tear
herself
free
her
hair
was
disordered
and
her
face
red
and
her
whole
being
throbbing
with
shame
but
he
still
held
her
in
his
tight
embrace
are
not
angry
helen
dear
he
asked
the
girl
gasped
told
me
that
i
might
kiss
you
he
said
and
she
was
so
choking
with
her
emotion
that
she
could
not
answer
a
word
she
could
only
shudder
and
submit
to
his
will
and
harrison
supposing
that
her
emotions
were
very
different
from
what
they
were
rested
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
smoothing
back
her
tangled
hair
and
whispering
into
her
ear
how
beautiful
she
was
beyond
any
dream
of
his
and
how
the
present
moment
was
the
happiest
of
his
lifetime
thought
it
would
never
come
dear
he
said
kissing
her
forehead
again
were
so
very
helen
had
not
yet
ceased
fighting
the
fearful
battle
in
her
own
heart
and
so
as
he
looked
into
her
eyes
she
gazed
up
at
him
and
forced
another
ghastly
smile
to
her
lips
they
looked
so
very
beautiful
that
harrison
kissed
them
again
and
again
and
he
would
probably
have
been
content
to
kiss
them
many
times
more
and
to
forget
everything
else
in
the
bliss
had
helen
been
willing
but
she
felt
just
then
that
if
the
strain
continued
longer
she
would
go
mad
with
a
laugh
that
was
half
hysterical
she
tore
herself
loose
by
main
force
and
sprang
up
reminding
the
other
that
he
had
a
train
to
catch
harrison
demurred
but
the
girl
would
hear
no
more
and
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
door
still
laughing
and
very
much
flushed
and
excited
so
that
he
thought
she
was
happier
than
ever
it
would
have
startled
him
could
he
have
seen
her
as
he
went
to
call
for
the
horses
how
she
staggered
and
clung
to
a
pillar
for
support
as
white
as
the
marble
she
leaned
against
he
did
not
see
her
however
and
when
the
two
were
driving
rapidly
away
she
was
as
vivacious
as
ever
helen
had
fought
yet
one
more
conflict
and
her
companion
was
not
skilled
enough
in
the
study
of
character
to
perceive
that
it
was
a
desperate
and
hysterical
kind
of
animation
poor
helen
was
facing
gigantic
shadows
just
then
and
life
wore
its
most
fearful
and
menacing
look
to
her
she
had
plunged
so
far
in
her
contest
that
it
was
now
a
battle
for
life
and
death
and
with
no
quarter
she
had
made
the
choice
of
atlas
of
endless
joy
or
endless
sorrow
and
in
her
struggle
to
keep
the
joy
she
was
becoming
more
and
more
frantic
more
and
more
terrified
at
the
thought
of
the
other
possibility
she
knew
that
to
fail
now
would
mean
shame
and
misery
more
overwhelming
than
she
could
bear
and
so
she
was
laughing
and
talking
with
frenzied
haste
and
every
now
and
then
she
would
stop
and
shudder
and
then
race
wildly
on
one
that
on
a
lonesome
road
doth
walk
in
fear
and
dread
and
having
once
turned
round
walks
on
and
turns
no
more
his
head
because
he
knows
a
frightful
fiend
doth
close
behind
him
and
so
all
through
the
ride
because
the
girl
shame
and
fear
haunted
her
more
and
more
she
became
more
and
more
hysterical
and
more
and
more
desperate
and
harrison
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
her
so
brilliant
and
so
daring
and
so
inspired
nor
did
he
have
the
least
idea
how
fearfully
overwrought
she
was
until
suddenly
as
they
came
to
a
fork
in
the
road
he
took
a
different
one
than
she
expected
and
she
clutched
him
wildly
by
the
arm
do
you
do
that
she
almost
screamed
he
asked
in
surprise
this
road
exclaimed
helen
stop
it
only
half
a
mile
or
so
farther
said
harrison
reining
up
his
horses
i
thought
you
like
the
panted
helen
with
more
agitation
than
ever
i
ca
we
have
to
go
through
hilltown
the
wondering
look
of
course
did
not
leave
the
other
face
at
that
explanation
object
to
hilltown
he
asked
said
helen
shuddering
is
a
horrible
i
thought
it
was
a
beautiful
town
laughed
he
of
course
it
is
for
you
to
then
he
gazed
about
him
to
find
a
place
to
turn
the
carriage
have
to
go
on
a
way
he
said
road
is
too
narrow
here
i
sorry
i
did
ask
you
but
i
had
no
idea
it
made
any
they
continued
however
for
fully
a
mile
and
the
road
remained
narrow
so
that
there
was
danger
of
upsetting
in
the
ditch
if
they
tried
to
turn
do
you
wish
me
to
do
harrison
asked
with
a
smile
more
we
go
on
the
longer
it
will
take
us
if
we
are
to
go
back
and
i
may
miss
my
train
is
your
prejudice
against
hilltown
so
very
strong
miss
davis
no
helen
answered
with
a
ghastly
smile
go
on
it
of
no
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
of
the
greatest
consequence
for
that
incident
marked
the
turning
point
of
the
battle
in
helen
heart
her
power
seemed
to
go
from
her
with
every
turn
of
the
wheels
that
brought
her
nearer
to
that
dreaded
place
and
she
became
more
and
more
silent
and
more
conscious
of
the
fearful
fact
that
her
wretchedness
was
mastering
her
again
it
seemed
to
her
terrified
imagination
as
if
everything
was
growing
dark
and
threatening
as
before
the
breaking
of
a
thunderstorm
must
indeed
dislike
hilltown
miss
davis
said
her
companion
smiling
are
you
so
very
silent
helen
made
no
reply
she
scarcely
heard
him
in
fact
so
taken
up
was
she
with
what
was
taking
place
in
her
own
mind
all
her
thoughts
then
were
about
arthur
and
what
had
become
of
him
and
what
he
was
thinking
about
her
and
chiefest
of
all
because
her
cheeks
and
forehead
had
a
fearfully
conscious
feeling
what
he
would
think
could
he
know
what
she
had
just
been
doing
thus
it
was
that
as
the
houses
of
hilltown
drew
near
remorse
and
shame
and
terror
were
rising
and
her
frantic
protests
against
them
were
weakening
until
suddenly
every
emotion
was
lost
in
suspense
and
the
shadows
of
the
great
that
arched
the
main
street
of
the
town
closed
them
in
helen
knew
the
house
where
arthur
lodged
and
knew
that
she
should
pass
it
in
another
minute
she
could
do
nothing
but
wait
and
watch
and
tremble
the
carriage
rattled
on
gazed
at
by
many
curious
eyes
for
everyone
in
hilltown
knew
about
the
young
beauty
and
the
prize
she
had
caught
but
helen
saw
no
one
and
had
eyes
for
only
one
thing
the
little
white
house
where
arthur
lodges
the
carriage
swept
by
and
she
saw
no
one
but
she
saw
that
the
curtain
of
arthur
room
was
drawn
and
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
he
should
be
dying
yet
it
was
a
great
load
off
her
mind
to
have
escaped
seeing
him
and
she
was
beginning
to
breathe
again
and
ask
herself
if
she
still
might
not
win
the
battle
when
the
carriage
came
to
the
end
of
the
town
and
to
a
sight
that
froze
her
blood
there
was
a
tavern
by
the
roadside
a
low
saloon
that
was
the
curse
of
the
place
and
she
saw
from
the
distance
a
figure
come
out
of
the
door
her
heart
gave
a
fearful
throb
for
it
was
a
slender
figure
clad
in
black
hatless
and
with
disordered
hair
and
clothing
in
a
moment
more
as
helen
clutched
the
rail
beside
her
and
stared
wildly
the
carriage
had
swept
on
and
come
opposite
the
man
and
he
glanced
up
into
helen
eyes
and
she
recognized
the
face
in
spite
of
all
its
ghastly
whiteness
and
its
sunken
cheeks
it
was
arthur
there
was
just
an
instant
meeting
of
their
looks
and
then
the
girl
was
whirled
on
but
that
one
glance
was
enough
to
leave
her
as
if
paralyzed
she
made
no
sound
nor
any
movement
and
so
her
companion
did
not
even
know
that
anything
had
happened
until
they
had
gone
half
a
mile
farther
then
as
he
chanced
to
glance
at
her
he
reined
up
his
horses
with
a
cry
he
exclaimed
is
the
matter
the
girl
clutched
his
arm
so
tightly
that
he
winced
powerful
man
that
he
was
me
home
she
gasped
quick
please
take
me
home

helen
ran
up
to
her
room
when
she
reached
home
and
shut
herself
in
and
after
that
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
suffer
all
of
her
excitement
was
gone
from
her
then
and
with
it
every
spark
of
her
strength
the
fiends
that
had
been
pursuing
her
rose
up
and
seized
hold
of
her
and
lashed
her
until
she
writhed
and
cried
aloud
in
agony
she
was
helpless
to
resist
them
knowing
not
which
way
to
turn
or
what
to
do
completely
cowed
and
terrified
but
there
was
no
more
sinking
into
the
dull
despair
that
had
mastered
her
before
the
face
of
arthur
as
she
had
seen
it
in
that
one
glimpse
had
been
burned
into
her
memory
with
fire
and
she
could
not
shut
it
from
her
sight
when
the
fact
that
he
had
come
from
the
tavern
and
what
that
must
mean
rose
before
her
it
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
cry
out
as
she
might
that
she
could
not
help
it
that
she
never
could
have
helped
it
that
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
moreover
if
there
was
any
possibility
of
the
girl
driving
out
that
specter
there
was
always
another
to
take
its
place
it
was
not
until
she
was
alone
in
her
room
until
all
her
resolution
was
gone
and
all
of
her
delusions
that
she
realized
the
actual
truth
about
what
she
had
done
that
afternoon
it
was
like
a
nightmare
to
her
then
she
seemed
always
to
feel
the
man
arms
clasping
her
and
whenever
she
thought
of
his
kisses
her
forehead
burned
her
like
fire
so
that
she
flung
herself
down
by
the
bedside
and
buried
it
in
the
pillows
it
was
thus
that
her
aunt
found
her
when
she
came
in
to
call
helen
to
dinner
and
this
time
the
latter
emotions
were
so
real
and
so
keen
that
there
was
no
prevailing
over
them
or
persuading
her
to
anything
do
want
to
eat
she
cried
again
and
again
in
answer
to
her
aunt
alarmed
insistence
i
am
not
coming
down
i
want
to
be
alone
alone
aunt
polly
please
leave
me
alone
helen
protested
roberts
you
please
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
what
in
the
world
can
have
happened
to
you
ca
tell
you
the
girl
cried
hysterically
want
you
to
go
and
leave
me
alone
and
she
shut
the
door
and
locked
it
and
then
began
pacing
wildly
up
and
down
the
room
heedless
of
the
fact
that
her
aunt
was
still
standing
out
in
the
hallway
the
girl
was
too
deeply
shaken
just
then
to
have
any
thought
about
appearances
she
was
thinking
about
arthur
again
and
about
his
fearful
plight
there
rushed
back
upon
her
all
the
memories
of
their
childhood
and
of
the
happiness
which
they
had
known
together
the
thought
of
the
broken
figure
which
she
had
seen
by
the
roadside
became
more
fearful
to
her
every
moment
it
was
not
that
it
troubled
her
conscience
for
helen
could
still
argue
to
herself
that
she
had
done
nothing
to
wrong
her
friend
that
there
had
been
nothing
selfish
in
her
attitude
towards
him
she
had
wished
him
to
be
happy
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
simply
a
result
of
the
cruel
perversity
of
things
that
she
had
been
trampling
upon
her
friend
happiness
in
order
to
reach
her
own
and
that
all
her
struggling
had
only
served
to
make
things
worse
the
fact
that
it
was
not
her
fault
however
did
not
make
the
situation
seem
less
tragic
and
fearful
to
her
it
had
come
to
such
a
crisis
now
that
it
drove
her
almost
mad
to
think
about
it
yet
she
was
completely
helpless
to
know
what
to
do
and
as
she
strode
up
and
down
the
room
she
clasped
her
hands
to
her
aching
head
and
cried
aloud
in
her
perplexity
then
too
her
surging
thoughts
hurried
on
to
another
unhappiness
to
her
father
and
what
he
would
say
when
he
learned
the
dreadful
news
how
could
she
explain
it
to
him
and
how
could
she
tell
him
about
her
marriage
at
the
mere
thought
of
that
the
other
horror
seized
upon
her
again
and
she
sank
down
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
how
can
i
have
done
it
she
gasped
to
herself
it
was
so
dreadful
and
what
am
i
to
do
now
that
last
was
the
chief
question
the
one
to
which
all
others
led
yet
it
was
one
to
which
she
could
find
no
answer
she
was
completely
confused
and
helpless
and
she
exclaimed
aloud
again
and
again
if
i
could
only
find
some
one
to
tell
me
i
do
not
know
how
i
can
keep
arthur
from
behaving
in
that
dreadful
way
and
i
know
that
i
can
not
ever
marry
harrison
the
more
she
tortured
herself
with
these
problems
the
more
agitated
she
became
she
sat
there
at
the
window
clutching
the
sill
in
her
hands
and
staring
out
seeing
nothing
and
knowing
only
that
the
time
was
flying
and
that
her
anxiety
was
building
itself
up
and
becoming
an
agony
which
she
could
not
bear
what
am
i
to
do
she
groaned
again
and
again
and
she
passed
hours
asking
herself
the
fearful
question
the
twilight
had
closed
about
her
and
the
moon
had
risen
behind
the
distant
hills
so
oblivious
to
all
things
about
her
was
she
that
she
failed
at
first
to
notice
something
else
something
which
would
ordinarily
have
attracted
her
attention
at
once
a
sound
of
music
which
came
to
her
from
somewhere
near
it
was
the
melody
of
grieg
den
played
upon
a
violin
and
it
had
stolen
into
helen
heart
and
become
part
of
her
own
stormy
emotion
before
she
had
even
thought
of
what
it
was
or
whence
it
came
the
little
piece
is
the
very
soul
of
the
springtime
passion
and
to
the
girl
it
was
the
very
utterance
of
all
her
yearning
lifting
her
heart
in
a
great
throbbing
prayer
when
it
had
died
away
her
hands
were
clenched
very
tightly
and
her
breath
was
coming
fast
she
remained
thus
for
a
minute
forgetful
of
everything
then
at
last
she
found
herself
thinking
must
be
howard
and
waiting
to
see
if
he
would
play
again
but
he
did
not
do
so
and
helen
sat
in
silence
for
a
long
time
her
thoughts
turned
to
him
she
found
herself
whispering
he
is
a
wonderful
musician
after
all
and
noticing
that
the
memory
of
his
wan
face
frightened
her
no
longer
it
seemed
just
then
that
there
could
be
no
one
in
the
world
more
wretched
than
herself
she
was
only
wishing
that
he
would
begin
again
for
that
utterance
of
her
grief
had
seemed
like
a
victory
and
now
in
the
silence
she
was
sinking
back
into
her
despair
the
more
she
waited
the
more
impatient
she
grew
until
suddenly
she
rose
from
her
seat
might
play
again
if
i
asked
him
she
said
to
herself
would
if
he
knew
i
was
unhappy
i
wonder
where
he
can
be
helen
window
was
in
the
front
of
the
house
opening
upon
a
broad
lawn
whose
walks
were
marked
in
the
moonlight
by
the
high
shrubbery
that
lined
them
some
distance
beyond
down
one
of
the
paths
were
two
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
music
had
come
from
one
of
them
probably
the
far
one
for
it
had
sounded
very
soft
no
sooner
had
the
thought
come
to
her
than
she
turned
and
went
quietly
to
the
door
she
ran
quickly
down
the
steps
and
seeing
her
aunt
and
roberts
upon
the
piazza
she
turned
and
passed
out
by
one
of
the
side
doors
helen
had
yielded
to
a
sudden
impulse
in
doing
thus
drawn
by
her
yearning
for
the
music
when
she
thought
about
it
as
she
walked
on
it
seemed
to
her
a
foolish
idea
for
the
man
could
not
possibly
know
of
her
trouble
and
moreover
was
probably
with
his
friend
the
lieutenant
but
she
did
not
stop
even
then
for
her
heart
hunger
still
drove
her
on
and
she
thought
see
and
perhaps
he
will
play
again
without
my
asking
i
can
sit
in
the
near
and
she
went
swiftly
on
with
that
purpose
in
mind
not
going
upon
the
path
because
she
would
have
been
in
the
full
moonlight
and
in
sight
of
the
two
upon
the
piazza
she
passed
silently
along
by
the
high
hedge
concealed
in
its
shadows
and
her
footsteps
deadened
by
the
grass
she
was
as
quiet
as
possible
wishing
to
be
in
the
without
anyone
knowing
it
and
she
had
come
very
close
to
it
indeed
within
a
few
yards
when
suddenly
she
stopped
short
with
an
inward
exclamation
the
silence
of
the
twilight
had
been
broken
by
a
voice
one
that
seemed
almost
beside
her
and
that
startled
her
with
a
realization
of
the
mistake
she
had
made
the
two
men
were
themselves
in
the
house
to
which
she
had
been
going
it
was
howard
voice
which
she
heard
he
was
speaking
very
low
almost
in
a
whisper
yet
helen
was
near
enough
to
hear
every
word
that
he
uttered
people
would
think
it
simply
a
happy
and
beautiful
piece
of
music
he
said
people
think
that
of
the
springtime
but
when
a
man
has
lived
as
i
he
may
find
that
the
springtime
too
is
a
great
labor
and
a
great
suffering
he
does
not
forget
that
for
the
thousands
of
creatures
that
win
the
great
fight
and
come
forth
rejoicing
there
are
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
that
go
down
and
have
their
mite
of
life
crushed
out
and
find
the
law
very
stern
indeed
even
those
that
win
do
it
by
a
fearful
effort
and
can
not
keep
their
beauty
long
so
that
the
springtime
passion
takes
on
a
kind
of
desperate
intensity
when
one
thinks
of
the
voice
ceased
again
for
a
moment
and
helen
stood
gazing
about
her
the
words
were
not
without
a
meaning
to
her
just
then
and
the
tone
of
the
man
voice
seemed
like
the
music
she
had
heard
him
play
she
would
have
liked
to
stay
and
listen
tho
she
knew
that
she
had
no
right
to
she
was
certain
that
she
had
not
been
seen
because
the
little
house
was
thickly
wrapped
about
with
eglantine
and
she
stood
uncertain
as
to
whether
she
ought
to
steal
back
or
go
out
and
join
the
two
men
in
the
meantime
the
voice
began
again
gives
a
man
a
new
feeling
of
the
preciousness
of
life
to
know
keenly
what
it
means
to
fail
to
be
like
a
tiny
spark
struggling
to
maintain
itself
in
the
darkness
and
finding
that
all
it
can
do
is
not
sufficient
and
that
it
is
sinking
back
into
nothingness
forever
i
think
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
wild
and
startled
look
that
the
creatures
of
the
forest
wear
and
it
is
a
very
tragic
thing
indeed
to
realize
and
makes
one
full
of
mercy
if
he
knows
his
own
heart
he
can
read
the
same
thing
in
the
faces
of
men
and
he
no
longer
even
laughs
at
their
pride
and
their
greediness
but
sees
them
quite
infinitely
wretched
and
pitiable
i
do
not
speak
merely
of
the
poor
and
hopeless
people
the
hunted
creatures
of
society
for
this
terror
is
not
merely
physical
it
is
the
same
imperative
of
life
that
makes
conscience
and
so
every
man
knows
it
who
has
made
himself
a
slave
to
his
body
and
sees
the
soul
within
him
helpless
and
sinking
and
every
man
who
has
sinned
and
sees
his
evil
stamped
upon
the
face
of
things
outside
him
in
shapes
of
terror
that
must
be
forever
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
think
the
man
who
lives
most
rightly
the
man
of
genius
knows
the
feeling
most
of
all
because
his
conscience
is
the
quickest
it
is
his
task
to
live
from
his
own
heart
to
take
the
power
that
is
within
him
and
wrestle
with
it
and
build
new
universes
from
it
to
be
a
pioneer
of
the
soul
so
to
speak
and
to
go
where
no
man
has
ever
been
before
and
yet
all
his
victory
is
nothing
to
him
because
he
knows
so
well
what
he
might
have
done
every
time
that
he
shrinks
as
he
must
shrink
from
what
is
so
hard
and
so
high
in
his
own
vision
he
knows
that
yet
another
glory
is
lost
forever
and
so
it
comes
that
he
stands
very
near
indeed
to
of
things
howard
stopped
again
and
helen
found
herself
leaning
forward
and
wondering
know
more
about
those
tears
than
most
people
the
man
went
on
slowly
after
a
long
pause
i
have
had
to
build
my
own
life
in
that
way
i
know
best
of
all
the
failure
for
that
has
been
my
lot
when
you
and
i
knew
each
other
i
was
very
strong
in
my
own
heart
and
i
could
always
find
what
joy
and
power
i
needed
for
the
living
of
my
life
but
there
have
come
to
me
since
in
the
years
that
i
have
dwelt
all
alone
with
my
great
trial
times
when
i
think
that
i
have
stood
face
to
face
with
this
thing
that
we
speak
of
this
naked
tragedy
and
terror
of
existence
there
have
been
times
when
all
the
yearning
and
all
the
prayer
that
i
had
could
not
save
me
when
i
have
known
that
i
had
not
an
ounce
of
resource
left
and
have
sat
and
watched
the
impulse
of
my
soul
die
within
me
and
all
my
strength
go
from
me
and
seen
myself
with
fearful
plainness
as
a
spark
of
yearning
a
living
thing
in
all
its
pitifulness
and
hunger
helpless
and
walled
up
in
darkness
to
feel
that
is
to
be
very
near
indeed
to
the
losing
creatures
and
their
sorrow
and
the
memory
of
one
such
time
is
enough
to
keep
a
man
merciful
forever
for
it
is
really
the
deepest
fact
about
life
that
a
man
can
know
how
it
is
so
hazardous
and
so
precious
how
it
keeps
its
head
above
the
great
ocean
of
the
infinite
only
by
all
the
force
it
can
exert
it
happens
sometimes
that
a
man
does
not
discover
that
truth
until
it
is
too
late
and
then
he
finds
life
very
cruel
and
savage
indeed
i
can
tell
howard
stopped
and
helen
drew
a
deep
breath
she
had
been
trembling
slightly
as
she
stood
listening
then
as
he
spoke
again
her
heart
gave
a
violent
throb
day
he
said
girl
that
we
were
talking
about
will
have
to
come
to
that
part
of
her
journey
it
is
a
very
sad
thing
to
will
understand
her
sonata
better
said
the
officer
was
the
reply
wish
i
could
think
even
that
i
know
how
sorrow
affects
a
person
whose
heart
is
true
how
it
draws
him
close
to
the
great
heart
of
life
and
teaches
him
its
sacredness
and
sends
him
forth
merciful
and
humble
but
selfish
misery
and
selfish
fear
are
no
less
ugly
than
selfish
happiness
a
person
who
suffers
ignobly
becomes
only
disgusted
and
disagreeable
and
more
selfish
than
ever
but
let
us
not
talk
any
more
about
miss
davis
for
it
is
not
a
pleasant
subject
to
a
man
who
seeks
as
i
do
to
keep
his
heart
full
of
worship
the
very
air
of
this
place
is
stifling
with
its
idleness
and
pride
it
gives
the
lie
to
all
my
faith
about
life
and
i
have
only
to
go
back
into
my
solitude
and
forget
it
as
soon
as
i
ought
not
to
be
a
difficult
thing
to
do
said
the
officer
is
for
me
the
other
answered
haunts
my
thoughts
all
the
he
paused
for
a
while
and
then
he
added
happened
to
think
of
something
i
came
across
this
morning
in
a
collection
of
french
verse
i
was
reading
william
did
you
ever
read
anything
of
auguste
brizeux
the
other
answered
in
the
negative
has
some
qualities
that
are
very
rare
in
french
poetry
went
on
howard
makes
one
think
of
wordsworth
i
happened
to
read
a
homely
little
ballad
of
his
a
story
of
some
of
that
tragedy
of
things
that
we
spoke
of
one
could
name
hundreds
of
such
poems
quite
as
good
i
suppose
but
this
happened
to
be
the
one
i
came
across
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
miss
davis
and
wondering
if
she
were
really
so
cold
and
so
hard
that
she
could
have
heard
this
story
without
shuddering
for
it
really
shook
me
very
is
it
the
other
asked
can
tell
you
the
story
in
a
few
words
said
howard
me
it
was
one
of
those
flashes
of
beauty
that
frighten
one
and
haunt
him
long
afterwards
and
i
do
not
quite
like
to
think
about
it
the
speaker
voice
dropped
and
the
girl
involuntarily
crept
a
little
nearer
to
hear
him
there
was
a
tree
in
front
of
her
and
she
leaned
against
it
breathing
very
hard
tho
making
no
sound
ballad
is
called
the
mason
said
howard
are
three
little
pictures
in
it
in
the
first
of
them
you
see
two
men
setting
off
to
their
work
together
one
of
them
bidding
his
wife
and
children
and
promising
to
return
with
his
friend
for
an
evening
feast
because
the
great
building
is
to
be
finished
then
you
see
them
at
work
swarming
upon
the
structure
and
rejoicing
in
their
success
and
then
you
hear
the
shouts
of
the
crowd
as
the
scaffolding
breaks
and
see
those
two
men
hanging
over
the
abyss
clinging
to
a
little
plank
it
is
not
strong
enough
to
hold
them
both
and
it
is
cracking
and
that
means
a
fearful
death
they
try
to
cling
to
the
stones
of
the
building
and
can
not
and
so
there
comes
one
of
those
fearful
moments
that
makes
a
man
heart
break
to
think
of
then
in
the
fearful
silence
you
hear
one
of
the
men
whisper
that
he
has
three
children
and
a
wife
and
you
see
the
other
gaze
at
him
an
instant
with
terror
in
his
eyes
and
then
let
go
his
hold
and
shoot
down
to
the
street
below
and
that
is
all
of
the
howard
stopped
and
there
followed
a
long
silence
afterwards
he
went
on
his
voice
trembling
is
all
he
said
of
course
that
the
man
was
killed
and
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
that
body
hurled
down
through
the
air
and
the
crushed
figure
and
the
writhing
limbs
i
fancy
the
epic
grandeur
of
soul
of
that
poor
ignorant
laborer
and
the
glory
that
must
have
flamed
up
in
his
heart
at
that
great
instant
so
i
find
it
a
dreadful
poem
and
wonder
if
it
would
not
frighten
that
careless
girl
to
read
howard
stopped
again
and
the
officer
asked
if
the
story
were
true
do
not
know
that
answered
the
other
do
i
care
it
is
enough
to
know
that
every
day
men
are
called
upon
to
face
the
shuddering
reality
of
existence
in
some
such
form
as
that
and
the
question
which
it
brought
to
my
heart
is
if
it
came
to
me
as
terrible
as
that
and
as
sudden
and
implacable
would
i
show
myself
the
man
or
the
dastard
and
that
filled
me
with
a
fearful
awe
and
humility
and
a
guilty
wonder
whether
somewhere
in
the
world
there
might
not
be
a
wall
from
which
i
should
be
throwing
myself
instead
of
nursing
my
illness
as
i
do
and
being
content
to
read
about
greatness
and
oh
i
tell
you
when
i
think
of
such
things
as
that
and
see
the
pride
and
worthlessness
of
this
thing
that
men
call
life
it
seemed
to
me
no
longer
heedless
folly
but
dastardly
and
fiendish
crime
so
that
one
can
only
bury
his
face
in
his
hands
and
sob
to
know
of
it
and
william
the
more
i
realized
it
the
more
unbearable
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
glorious
girl
with
all
her
beauty
should
be
plunging
herself
into
a
stream
so
foul
i
felt
as
if
it
were
cowardice
of
mine
that
i
did
not
take
her
by
the
hand
and
try
to
make
her
see
what
madness
she
was
do
you
not
asked
the
lieutenant
think
i
should
have
in
my
more
quixotic
days
replied
the
other
sadly
perhaps
some
day
i
may
find
myself
in
a
kind
of
high
life
where
royal
sincerity
is
understood
but
in
this
world
even
an
idealist
has
to
keep
a
sense
of
humor
unless
he
happens
to
be
dowered
with
an
isaiah
howard
paused
for
a
moment
and
laughed
slightly
then
however
he
went
on
more
earnestly
as
i
think
of
it
i
know
that
i
could
frighten
her
i
think
that
if
i
should
tell
her
of
some
of
the
days
and
nights
that
i
have
spent
in
tossing
upon
a
bed
of
fire
she
might
find
the
cup
of
her
selfishness
a
trifle
less
pleasant
to
drink
it
is
something
that
i
have
noticed
with
people
that
they
may
be
coarse
or
shallow
enough
to
laugh
at
virtue
and
earnestness
but
there
are
very
few
who
do
not
bow
their
heads
before
suffering
for
that
is
something
physical
and
they
may
harden
their
conscience
if
they
please
but
from
the
possibility
of
bodily
pain
they
know
that
they
can
never
be
safe
and
they
seem
to
know
that
a
man
who
has
walked
with
that
demon
has
laid
his
hand
upon
the
grim
reality
of
things
before
which
their
shams
and
vanities
shrink
into
nothingness
the
sight
of
it
is
always
a
kind
of
warning
of
the
seriousness
of
life
and
so
even
when
people
feel
no
sympathy
they
can
not
but
feel
fear
i
saw
for
instance
that
the
first
time
this
girl
saw
me
she
turned
pale
and
she
would
not
come
anywhere
near
as
the
speaker
paused
again
lieutenant
maynard
said
very
quietly
should
think
that
would
be
a
hard
cross
to
bear
said
howard
with
a
slight
smile
had
not
that
thought
in
my
mind
i
have
seen
too
much
of
the
reality
of
life
to
trouble
myself
or
the
the
world
with
vanity
of
that
very
crude
kind
i
can
sometimes
imagine
myself
being
proud
of
my
serenity
but
that
is
one
step
beyond
at
any
rate
a
man
who
lives
in
his
soul
very
seldom
thinks
of
himself
in
an
external
way
when
i
look
in
the
glass
it
is
generally
to
think
how
strange
it
is
that
this
form
of
mine
should
be
that
which
represents
me
to
men
and
i
can
not
find
anything
they
might
really
learn
about
me
except
the
one
physical
fact
of
can
certainly
not
fail
to
learn
that
said
the
other
replied
howard
sadly
know
if
any
man
does
what
it
is
to
earn
one
life
by
suffering
and
labor
that
is
why
i
have
so
mastering
a
sense
of
life
preciousness
and
why
i
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
this
dreadful
fact
of
wealth
it
is
the
same
thing
too
that
makes
me
feel
so
keenly
about
this
girl
and
her
beauty
and
keeps
her
in
my
thoughts
i
do
think
i
could
tell
you
how
the
sight
of
her
affected
me
unless
you
knew
how
i
have
lived
all
these
lonely
years
for
i
have
had
no
friends
and
no
strength
for
any
of
the
world
work
and
all
my
battle
has
been
with
my
own
soul
to
be
brave
and
to
keep
my
through
all
my
trials
i
think
my
illness
has
acted
as
a
kind
of
nervous
stimulus
upon
me
as
if
it
were
only
by
laboring
to
dwell
upon
the
heights
of
my
being
night
and
day
that
i
could
have
strength
to
stand
against
despair
the
result
is
that
i
have
lived
for
days
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
of
effort
with
all
my
faculties
at
white
heat
and
it
has
always
been
the
artist
life
it
has
always
been
beauty
that
brought
me
the
joy
that
i
needed
and
given
me
the
strength
to
go
on
beauty
is
the
sign
of
victory
and
the
prize
of
it
in
this
heart
battle
the
more
i
have
suffered
and
labored
the
more
keenly
i
have
come
to
feel
that
until
the
commonest
flower
has
a
song
for
me
and
william
the
time
i
saw
this
girl
she
wore
a
rose
in
her
hair
but
she
was
so
perfect
that
i
scarcely
saw
the
flower
there
is
that
in
a
man
heart
which
makes
it
that
to
him
the
fairest
and
most
sacred
of
god
creatures
must
always
be
the
maiden
when
i
was
young
i
walked
about
the
earth
half
drunk
with
a
dream
of
love
and
even
now
when
i
am
twice
as
old
as
my
years
and
burnt
out
and
dying
i
could
not
but
start
when
i
saw
this
girl
for
i
fancied
that
she
must
carry
about
in
that
maiden
heart
of
hers
some
high
notion
of
what
she
meant
in
the
world
and
what
was
due
to
her
when
a
man
gazes
upon
beauty
such
as
hers
there
is
a
feeling
that
comes
to
him
that
is
quite
unutterable
a
feeling
born
of
all
the
weakness
and
failure
and
sin
of
his
lifetime
for
every
true
man
life
is
a
failure
and
this
is
the
vision
that
he
sought
with
so
much
pain
the
thing
that
might
have
been
had
he
kept
the
faith
with
his
own
genius
it
is
so
that
beauty
is
the
conscience
of
the
artist
and
that
there
must
always
be
something
painful
and
terrible
about
high
perfection
it
was
that
way
that
i
felt
when
i
saw
this
girl
face
and
i
dreamt
my
old
dream
of
the
sweetness
and
glory
of
a
heart
i
thought
of
its
spotlessness
and
of
its
royal
scorn
of
baseness
and
i
tell
you
william
if
i
had
found
it
thus
i
could
have
been
content
to
worship
and
not
even
ask
that
the
girl
look
at
me
for
a
man
when
he
has
lived
as
i
have
lived
can
feel
towards
anything
more
perfect
than
himself
a
quite
wonderful
kind
of
humility
i
know
that
all
the
trouble
with
my
helpless
struggling
is
that
i
must
be
everything
to
myself
and
can
not
find
anything
to
love
and
so
be
at
peace
that
was
the
way
i
felt
when
i
saw
this
miss
davis
all
that
agitation
and
all
that
yearning
and
was
it
not
enough
to
make
a
man
mock
at
himself
to
learn
the
real
truth
i
was
glad
that
it
did
not
happen
to
me
when
i
was
young
and
dependent
upon
things
about
me
is
it
not
easy
to
imagine
how
a
young
man
might
make
such
a
woman
the
dream
of
his
life
how
he
might
lay
all
his
prayer
at
her
feet
and
how
when
he
learned
of
her
fearful
baseness
it
might
make
of
him
a
mocking
libertine
for
the
rest
of
his
days
think
it
baseness
asked
lieutenant
maynard
tried
to
persuade
myself
at
first
that
it
must
be
only
blindness
i
wondered
to
myself
she
not
see
the
difference
between
the
life
of
these
people
about
her
and
the
music
and
poetry
her
aunt
tells
me
she
loves
i
never
waste
any
of
my
worry
upon
the
old
and
hardened
of
these
vulgar
and
worldly
people
it
is
enough
for
me
to
know
why
the
women
are
dull
and
full
of
gossip
and
to
know
how
much
depth
there
is
in
the
pride
and
in
the
wisdom
of
the
men
but
it
was
very
hard
for
me
to
give
up
my
dream
of
the
girl
purity
i
rememher
i
thought
of
heine
art
as
a
flower
and
my
heart
was
full
of
prayer
i
wondered
if
it
might
not
be
possible
to
tell
her
that
one
can
not
combine
music
and
a
social
career
and
that
one
can
not
really
buy
happiness
with
sin
i
thought
that
perhaps
she
might
be
grateful
for
the
warning
that
in
cutting
herself
off
from
the
great
deepening
experience
of
woman
she
was
consigning
herself
to
stagnation
and
wretchedness
from
which
no
money
could
ever
purchase
her
ransom
i
thought
that
possibly
she
did
not
see
that
this
man
knew
nothing
of
her
preciousness
and
had
no
high
thoughts
about
her
beauty
that
was
the
way
i
argued
with
myself
about
her
innocence
and
you
may
fancy
the
kind
of
laughter
that
came
over
me
at
the
truth
it
is
a
ghastly
thing
william
the
utter
hardness
the
grim
and
determined
worldliness
of
this
girl
for
she
knew
very
well
what
she
was
doing
and
all
the
ignorance
was
on
my
part
she
had
no
care
about
anything
in
the
world
until
that
man
came
in
and
the
short
half
hour
that
i
watched
them
was
enough
to
tell
her
that
her
life
happiness
was
won
but
only
think
of
her
william
with
all
her
beauty
allowing
herself
to
be
kissed
by
him
try
to
fancy
what
new
kind
of
fiendishness
must
lie
in
her
heart
i
remember
that
she
is
to
marry
him
because
he
pays
her
millions
and
the
word
prostitution
keeps
haunting
my
memory
when
i
try
to
define
it
i
find
that
the
millions
do
not
alter
it
in
the
least
that
is
a
very
cruel
thought
a
thought
that
drives
away
everything
but
the
prayer
and
i
sit
and
wonder
what
fearful
punishment
the
hand
of
fate
will
deal
out
for
such
a
thing
as
that
what
hatefulness
it
will
stamp
upon
her
for
a
sign
to
men
and
then
because
the
perfect
face
still
haunts
my
memory
i
have
a
very
feeling
indeed
that
i
could
truly
die
to
save
that
girl
from
such
a
there
was
another
long
silence
and
then
suddenly
howard
rose
from
his
seat
he
said
in
a
different
voice
is
all
useless
so
why
should
we
talk
so
the
girl
has
to
live
her
own
life
and
learn
these
things
for
herself
and
in
the
meantime
perhaps
i
am
letting
myself
be
too
much
moved
by
her
beauty
for
there
are
many
people
in
the
world
who
are
not
beautiful
but
who
suffer
things
they
do
not
deserve
to
suffer
and
who
really
deserve
our
sympathy
and
fancy
you
not
be
much
thanked
for
it
in
this
case
said
the
other
with
a
dry
laugh
howard
stood
for
some
moments
in
silence
and
then
turned
away
to
end
the
conversation
fear
he
said
i
have
kept
you
more
than
i
have
any
right
to
let
us
go
back
to
the
house
it
is
not
very
polite
to
our
hostess
to
stay
so
must
be
nearly
time
for
my
train
anyhow
said
the
officer
and
a
moment
later
the
two
had
passed
out
of
the
and
up
the
path
lieutenant
maynard
carrying
howard
in
his
hand
the
two
did
not
see
helen
as
they
passed
her
the
reason
was
that
helen
was
stretched
out
upon
the
ground
by
the
side
of
the
hedge
it
was
not
that
she
was
hiding
she
had
no
thought
of
that
it
was
because
she
had
been
struck
there
by
the
scathing
words
that
she
had
heard
some
of
them
were
so
bitter
that
they
could
only
have
filled
her
with
rage
had
she
not
known
that
they
were
true
and
had
she
not
been
awed
by
what
she
had
learned
of
this
man
heart
she
could
feel
only
terror
and
fiery
shame
and
the
cruel
words
had
beaten
her
down
first
upon
her
knees
and
then
upon
her
face
and
they
lashed
her
like
whips
of
flame
and
tore
into
her
flesh
and
made
her
writhe
she
dared
not
cry
out
or
even
sob
she
could
only
dig
into
the
ground
with
her
quivering
fingers
and
lie
there
shuddering
in
a
fearful
way
long
after
the
two
men
were
gone
her
cruel
punishment
still
continued
for
she
still
seemed
to
hear
his
words
seared
into
her
memory
with
fire
as
they
had
been
what
howard
had
said
had
come
like
a
flash
of
lightning
in
the
darkness
to
show
her
actions
as
they
really
were
the
last
fearful
sentences
which
she
had
heard
had
set
all
her
being
aflame
and
the
thought
of
embraces
filled
her
now
with
a
perfect
spasm
of
shame
and
loathing
sold
myself
to
him
for
money
she
panted
god
for
money
but
then
suddenly
she
raised
herself
up
and
stared
about
her
crying
out
no
it
is
not
true
it
is
not
true
i
could
never
have
done
it
i
should
have
gone
mad
and
a
moment
later
helen
had
staggered
to
her
feet
must
tell
him
she
gasped
must
not
think
so
of
me
howard
had
come
to
her
as
a
vision
from
a
higher
world
making
all
that
she
had
known
and
admired
seem
hideous
and
base
and
her
one
thought
just
then
was
of
him
will
still
scorn
me
she
thought
i
must
tell
him
i
really
did
and
heedless
of
the
fact
that
her
hair
was
loose
about
her
shoulders
and
her
dress
wet
with
the
dew
of
the
grass
the
girl
ran
swiftly
up
the
lawn
towards
the
house
whispering
again
and
again
must
tell
him
it
was
only
a
minute
more
before
she
was
near
the
piazza
and
could
see
the
people
upon
it
as
they
stood
in
the
lighted
doorway
howard
was
one
of
them
and
helen
would
have
rushed
blindly
up
to
speak
to
him
had
it
not
been
that
another
thought
came
to
her
to
stop
her
he
should
know
of
arthur
she
muttered
clenching
her
hands
until
the
nails
cut
her
flesh
what
would
he
think
then
and
what
could
i
tell
him
and
she
shrank
back
into
the
darkness
like
a
black
and
guilty
thing
she
crept
around
the
side
of
the
house
and
entered
by
another
door
stealing
into
one
of
the
darkened
parlors
where
she
flung
herself
down
upon
a
sofa
and
lay
trembling
before
that
new
terror
when
a
few
minutes
had
passed
and
she
heard
a
carriage
outside
she
sprang
up
wildly
with
the
thought
that
he
might
be
going
she
had
run
half
way
to
the
door
before
she
recollected
that
the
carriage
must
be
for
the
lieutenant
and
then
she
stopped
and
stood
still
in
the
darkness
twisting
her
hands
together
nervously
and
asking
herself
what
she
could
do
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
could
look
down
the
piazza
from
the
window
of
the
room
and
so
she
went
swiftly
to
it
the
officer
was
just
descending
to
the
carriage
roberts
with
him
and
her
aunt
and
howard
standing
at
the
top
of
the
steps
the
latter
figure
clearly
outlined
in
the
moonlight
helen
heart
was
so
full
of
despair
and
yearning
just
then
that
she
could
have
rushed
out
and
flung
herself
at
his
feet
had
he
been
alone
but
she
felt
a
new
kind
of
shrinking
from
her
aunt
she
stood
hesitating
therefore
muttering
to
herself
must
let
him
know
about
it
somehow
and
he
will
tell
me
what
to
do
oh
i
must
and
i
must
tell
him
now
before
it
is
too
late
she
stood
by
the
window
panting
and
almost
choking
with
her
emotion
kneading
her
hands
one
upon
the
other
in
frenzied
agitation
and
then
she
heard
howard
say
to
her
aunt
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
excuse
me
now
for
i
must
not
forget
that
i
am
an
and
helen
clutched
her
burning
temples
seeing
him
turn
to
enter
the
house
and
seeing
that
her
chance
was
going
she
glanced
around
her
almost
desperate
and
then
suddenly
her
heart
gave
a
great
leap
for
just
beside
her
was
something
that
had
brought
one
resource
to
her
mind
she
had
seen
the
piano
in
the
dim
light
and
had
thought
suddenly
of
the
song
that
howard
had
mentioned
will
remember
she
thought
swiftly
as
she
ran
to
the
instrument
and
sat
down
before
it
with
a
strength
born
of
her
desperation
she
mastered
the
quivering
of
her
hands
and
catching
her
breath
began
in
a
weak
and
trembling
voice
the
melody
of
rubenstein
art
as
a
flower
so
pure
and
fair
thou
art
i
gaze
on
thee
and
sorrow
doth
steal
into
my
heart
would
lay
my
hands
upon
thee
upon
thy
snowy
brow
and
pray
that
god
might
keep
thee
so
pure
and
fair
as
helen
did
not
know
how
she
was
singing
she
thought
only
of
telling
her
yearning
and
her
pain
she
was
so
choked
with
emotion
that
she
could
scarcely
utter
a
sound
at
all
and
the
song
must
have
startled
those
who
heard
it
it
was
laden
with
all
the
tears
that
had
been
gathering
in
helen
heart
for
days
she
did
not
finish
the
song
she
was
thinking
he
understand
she
stopped
suddenly
as
she
saw
a
shadow
upon
the
porch
outside
telling
her
that
mr
howard
had
come
nearer
there
was
a
minute
or
so
of
breathless
suspense
and
then
as
the
shadow
began
to
draw
slowly
backwards
helen
clenched
her
hands
convulsively
whispering
to
herself
will
think
it
was
only
an
accident
oh
what
can
i
do
there
are
some
people
all
of
whose
emotions
take
the
form
of
music
there
came
into
helen
mind
at
that
instant
a
melody
that
was
the
very
soul
of
her
agitation
and
her
longing
macdowell
a
water
lily
the
girl
thought
of
what
howard
had
said
about
the
feeling
that
comes
to
suffering
mortals
at
the
sight
of
something
perfect
and
serene
and
she
began
playing
the
little
piece
very
softly
and
with
trembling
hands
it
is
quite
wonderful
music
to
helen
with
her
heart
full
of
grief
and
despair
the
chords
that
floated
so
cold
and
white
and
high
were
almost
too
much
to
be
borne
she
played
desperately
on
however
because
she
saw
that
howard
had
stopped
again
and
she
did
not
believe
that
he
could
fail
to
understand
that
music
so
she
continued
until
she
came
to
the
pleading
song
of
the
swan
the
music
is
written
to
a
poem
of
geibel
which
tells
of
the
lily
and
of
the
bird
which
wonders
at
its
beauty
afterwards
because
there
is
nothing
in
all
nature
more
cold
and
unapproachable
than
a
and
because
one
might
sing
to
it
all
day
and
never
fancy
that
it
heard
him
the
first
melody
rises
again
as
keen
and
as
high
as
ever
and
one
knows
that
his
yearning
is
in
vain
and
that
there
is
nothing
for
him
but
his
old
despair
when
helen
came
to
that
she
could
go
no
farther
for
her
wretchedness
had
been
heaping
itself
up
and
her
heart
was
bursting
her
fingers
gave
way
as
she
struck
the
keys
and
she
sank
down
and
hid
her
face
in
her
arms
and
broke
into
wild
and
passionate
sobbing
she
was
almost
choking
with
her
emotions
so
shaken
that
she
was
no
longer
conscious
of
what
went
on
about
her
she
did
not
hear
howard
voice
as
he
entered
and
she
did
not
even
hear
the
frightened
exclamations
of
her
aunt
until
the
latter
had
flung
her
arms
about
her
then
she
sprang
up
and
tore
herself
loose
by
main
force
rushing
upstairs
and
locking
herself
in
her
own
room
where
she
flung
herself
down
upon
the
bed
and
wept
until
she
could
weep
no
more
in
the
meantime
not
even
hearing
her
aunt
voice
from
the
hallway
and
altogether
unconscious
of
the
flight
of
time
when
she
sat
up
and
brushed
away
her
tangled
hair
and
gazed
about
her
everything
in
the
house
was
silent
she
herself
was
exhausted
but
she
rose
and
after
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
a
few
minutes
seated
herself
at
the
writing
desk
and
in
spite
of
her
trembling
fingers
wrote
a
short
note
to
gerald
harrison
then
with
a
deep
breath
of
relief
she
rose
and
going
to
the
window
knelt
down
in
front
of
it
and
gazed
out
the
moon
was
high
in
the
sky
by
that
time
and
the
landscape
about
her
was
flooded
with
its
light
everything
was
so
calm
and
still
that
the
girl
held
her
breath
as
she
watched
it
but
suddenly
she
gave
a
start
for
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
violin
again
so
very
faint
that
she
at
first
thought
she
was
deluding
herself
as
she
listened
however
she
heard
it
more
plainly
and
then
she
realized
in
a
flash
that
howard
must
have
heard
her
sobbing
and
that
he
was
playing
something
for
her
it
was
schumann
and
as
the
girl
knelt
there
her
soul
was
borne
away
upon
the
wings
of
that
heavenly
melody
and
there
welled
up
in
her
heart
a
new
and
very
different
emotion
from
any
that
she
had
ever
known
before
it
was
born
half
of
the
music
and
half
of
the
calm
and
the
stillness
of
the
night
that
wonderful
peace
which
may
come
to
mortals
either
in
victory
or
defeat
when
they
give
up
their
weakness
and
their
fear
and
become
aware
of
the
infinite
presence
when
the
melody
had
died
away
and
helen
rose
there
was
a
new
light
in
her
eyes
and
a
new
beauty
upon
her
countenance
and
she
knew
that
her
soul
was
right
at
last
chapter
x
acts
our
angels
are
or
good
or
ill
our
fatal
shadows
that
walk
by
us
naturally
there
was
considerable
agitation
in
the
roberts
family
on
account
of
helen
strange
behavior
early
the
next
morning
roberts
was
at
her
niece
door
trying
to
gain
admittance
this
time
she
did
not
have
to
knock
but
once
and
when
she
entered
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
helen
was
already
up
and
dressing
she
had
been
expecting
to
find
the
girl
more
prostrated
than
ever
and
so
the
discovery
was
a
great
relief
to
her
she
stood
gazing
at
her
anxiously
dear
she
said
scarcely
know
how
to
begin
to
talk
to
you
about
your
extraordinary
wish
interrupted
helen
you
would
not
begin
to
talk
to
me
about
it
at
you
must
explain
to
me
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
protested
the
other
can
not
possibly
explain
to
you
was
the
abrupt
reply
voice
was
firm
and
there
was
a
determined
look
upon
her
face
a
look
which
quite
took
her
aunt
by
surprise
my
dear
girl
she
began
once
more
polly
said
the
other
interrupting
her
again
wish
instead
of
talking
about
it
you
would
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
for
a
few
moments
for
i
have
made
up
my
mind
just
what
i
am
going
to
do
and
i
am
going
to
take
the
reins
in
my
own
hands
and
not
do
any
arguing
or
explaining
to
anyone
and
there
is
no
use
of
asking
me
a
word
about
what
has
happened
for
i
could
not
hope
to
make
you
understand
me
and
i
do
not
mean
to
as
helen
uttered
those
words
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
aunt
with
an
unflinching
gaze
with
the
result
that
roberts
was
quite
too
much
taken
aback
to
find
a
word
to
say
without
waiting
for
anything
more
helen
turned
to
the
table
is
a
letter
she
said
i
have
written
to
harrison
you
know
his
address
in
new
york
i
suppose
address
stammered
the
other
yes
of
course
but
what
in
the
world
wish
this
letter
delivered
to
him
at
once
aunt
polly
helen
continued
is
of
the
utmost
importance
and
i
want
you
to
do
me
the
favor
to
send
someone
into
the
city
with
it
by
the
next
helen
dear
please
do
not
ask
me
anything
about
it
went
on
the
girl
impatiently
have
told
you
that
you
must
let
me
manage
this
affair
myself
if
you
will
not
send
it
i
shall
simply
have
to
get
someone
to
take
it
he
must
have
it
and
have
it
at
it
not
do
to
mail
it
helen
because
i
wish
him
to
get
it
this
and
helen
put
the
letter
into
her
aunt
hands
while
the
latter
gazed
helplessly
first
at
it
and
then
at
the
girl
there
is
an
essay
of
bacon
in
which
is
set
forth
the
truth
that
you
can
bewilder
and
master
anyone
if
you
are
only
sufficiently
bold
and
rapid
roberts
was
so
used
to
managing
everything
and
being
looked
up
to
by
everyone
that
helen
present
mood
left
her
quite
dazed
nor
did
the
girl
give
her
any
time
to
recover
her
presence
of
mind
is
only
one
thing
more
she
said
want
you
to
have
breakfast
as
soon
as
you
can
and
then
to
let
me
have
a
carriage
at
carriage
echoed
the
other
aunt
polly
i
wish
to
drive
over
to
hilltown
hilltown
gasped
aunt
polly
with
yet
greater
consternation
and
showing
signs
of
resistance
at
last
what
but
helen
only
came
again
to
the
attack
with
yet
more
audacity
and
confidence
she
said
hilltown
i
mean
to
go
to
see
for
answer
to
that
last
statement
poor
roberts
had
simply
no
words
whatever
she
could
only
gaze
and
in
the
meantime
helen
was
going
calmly
on
with
her
dressing
as
if
the
matter
were
settled
howard
be
down
to
breakfast
she
asked
he
is
going
away
i
presume
he
will
be
down
was
the
reply
after
which
helen
quickly
completed
her
toilet
her
aunt
standing
by
and
watching
her
in
the
meantime
dear
she
asked
at
last
after
having
recovered
her
faculties
a
trifle
you
really
mean
that
you
will
not
explain
to
me
a
thing
of
what
has
happened
or
of
what
you
are
doing
is
so
much
aunt
polly
that
i
can
not
possibly
explain
it
now
i
have
too
much
else
to
think
of
you
must
simply
let
me
go
my
way
and
i
will
tell
you
helen
is
that
the
right
way
to
treat
me
is
it
nothing
to
you
all
the
interest
that
i
have
taken
in
this
and
all
that
i
have
done
for
you
that
you
should
think
so
little
of
my
advice
do
not
need
any
advice
now
was
the
answer
polly
i
see
exactly
what
i
should
do
and
i
do
not
mean
to
stop
a
minute
for
anything
else
until
i
have
done
it
if
it
seems
unkind
i
am
very
sorry
but
in
the
meantime
it
must
be
and
while
she
was
saying
the
words
helen
was
putting
on
her
hat
then
taking
up
her
parasol
and
gloves
she
turned
towards
her
aunt
am
ready
now
she
said
please
let
me
have
breakfast
just
as
soon
as
you
the
girl
was
so
much
preoccupied
with
her
own
thoughts
and
purposes
that
she
scarcely
even
heard
what
her
aunt
said
she
went
down
into
the
garden
where
she
could
be
alone
and
paced
up
and
down
impatiently
until
she
heard
the
bell
then
she
went
up
into
the
dining
room
where
she
found
her
aunt
and
uncle
in
conversation
with
howard
helen
had
long
been
preparing
herself
to
meet
him
but
she
could
not
keep
her
cheeks
from
flushing
or
keep
from
lowering
her
eyes
she
bit
her
lips
together
however
and
forced
herself
to
look
at
him
saying
very
resolutely
howard
i
have
to
drive
over
to
hilltown
after
breakfast
and
i
wish
very
much
to
talk
to
you
about
something
would
you
like
to
drive
with
me
much
indeed
said
he
quietly
after
which
helen
said
not
a
word
more
she
saw
that
her
aunt
and
uncle
were
gazing
at
her
and
at
each
other
in
silent
wonder
but
she
paid
no
attention
to
it
after
eating
a
few
hurried
mouthfuls
she
excused
herself
and
rose
and
went
outside
where
she
saw
the
which
had
been
bought
for
her
use
waiting
for
her
it
was
not
much
longer
before
howard
was
ready
for
he
saw
her
agitation
is
rather
a
strange
hour
to
start
upon
a
drive
she
said
to
him
i
have
real
cause
for
hurrying
i
will
explain
about
and
then
she
stopped
as
her
aunt
came
out
to
join
them
it
was
only
a
moment
more
before
howard
had
excused
himself
and
the
two
were
in
the
wagon
helen
taking
the
reins
she
waved
a
farewell
to
her
aunt
and
then
started
the
horse
and
they
were
whirled
swiftly
away
down
the
road
all
the
morning
helen
mind
had
been
filled
with
things
that
she
wished
to
say
to
howard
but
now
all
her
resolution
seemed
to
have
left
her
and
she
was
trembling
very
much
and
staring
straight
ahead
busying
herself
with
guiding
the
horse
when
they
were
out
upon
the
main
road
where
they
might
go
as
fast
as
they
pleased
without
that
necessity
she
swallowed
the
lump
in
her
throat
and
made
one
or
two
nervous
attempts
to
speak
howard
in
the
meantime
had
been
gazing
in
front
of
him
thoughtfully
davis
he
said
suddenly
turning
his
eyes
upon
her
i
ask
you
a
question
said
helen
faintly
heard
all
that
i
said
about
you
last
night
and
helen
turned
very
red
and
looked
away
i
heard
it
all
she
said
and
then
there
was
a
long
silence
it
was
broken
by
the
man
who
began
in
a
low
voice
scarcely
know
how
miss
davis
i
can
apologize
to
you
and
then
he
stopped
short
for
the
girl
had
turned
her
glance
upon
him
wonderingly
she
said
she
had
never
once
thought
of
that
view
of
it
and
the
word
took
her
by
surprise
said
howard
said
so
many
hard
and
cruel
things
that
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
helen
still
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
as
she
said
you
say
anything
that
was
not
true
howard
the
man
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
he
answered
said
many
things
that
i
had
no
right
to
say
to
is
not
it
said
helen
simply
you
say
anything
that
was
not
true
again
howard
paused
am
quite
sure
that
i
did
he
said
at
last
of
what
i
said
i
feel
to
have
been
untrue
since
i
have
seen
how
it
affected
it
made
me
so
ashamed
said
helen
and
then
some
of
the
thoughts
that
possessed
her
forced
their
way
out
and
she
hurried
on
impetuously
was
the
first
thing
i
wanted
to
tell
you
it
is
really
true
that
you
were
wrong
for
i
am
not
at
all
it
was
something
that
my
that
people
were
making
me
do
and
all
the
time
i
was
wretched
it
was
dreadful
i
know
but
i
was
tempted
because
i
do
love
beautiful
things
and
it
was
all
so
sudden
and
i
could
not
realize
it
and
i
had
nobody
to
advise
me
for
none
of
the
people
i
meet
would
think
it
was
wrong
you
must
talk
to
me
and
help
me
because
i
got
to
be
very
strong
my
aunt
will
be
angry
and
when
i
get
back
perhaps
harrison
will
be
there
and
i
shall
have
to
tell
then
the
girl
stopped
out
of
breath
and
trembling
with
excitement
howard
turned
abruptly
and
fixed
his
dark
eyes
upon
her
him
he
said
him
what
i
shall
not
marry
him
of
course
answered
helen
the
other
gave
a
start
but
she
was
so
eager
that
she
did
not
even
notice
it
could
not
lose
a
minute
she
said
it
was
so
very
dreadful
you
you
really
mean
not
to
marry
him
asked
the
other
it
echoed
the
girl
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
how
in
the
world
could
you
suppose
and
then
she
stopped
short
and
laughed
nervously
course
she
said
forgot
you
might
suppose
anything
but
oh
if
i
could
tell
you
how
i
have
suffered
howard
you
would
understand
that
i
could
never
have
such
a
thought
again
in
the
world
please
do
understand
me
for
if
i
had
really
been
so
base
i
should
not
come
to
you
as
i
do
after
what
i
heard
i
can
not
tell
you
how
dreadfully
i
suffered
while
i
was
listening
but
after
i
had
cried
so
much
about
it
i
felt
better
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
me
just
to
see
my
actions
as
they
seemed
to
someone
else
to
someone
who
was
good
i
saw
all
at
once
the
truth
of
what
i
was
doing
and
it
was
agony
to
me
to
know
that
you
thought
so
of
me
that
was
why
i
could
not
rest
last
night
until
i
had
told
you
that
i
was
really
unhappy
for
it
was
something
that
i
was
unhappy
was
it
howard
said
the
other
was
very
much
oh
i
want
you
to
know
the
truth
helen
went
on
swiftly
it
is
just
egotism
on
my
part
and
i
have
really
no
right
to
tell
you
all
about
myself
in
this
way
and
perhaps
you
will
scorn
me
when
you
come
to
know
the
whole
truth
but
i
can
not
help
telling
you
about
it
so
that
you
may
advise
me
what
to
do
i
was
all
helpless
and
lost
and
what
you
said
came
last
night
like
a
wonderful
light
and
i
do
care
what
you
think
about
me
if
you
will
only
tell
me
the
real
truth
in
just
the
same
way
that
you
did
for
i
realized
afterwards
that
it
was
that
which
had
helped
me
so
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
it
had
ever
happened
to
me
when
you
meet
people
in
the
world
they
only
say
things
that
they
know
will
please
you
and
that
does
you
no
good
i
never
realized
before
how
a
person
might
go
through
the
world
and
really
never
meet
with
another
heart
in
all
his
life
and
that
one
can
be
fearfully
lonely
even
in
a
parlor
full
of
people
did
you
ever
think
of
that
howard
howard
had
fixed
his
keen
eyes
upon
the
girl
as
she
went
breathlessly
on
she
was
very
pale
and
the
sorrow
through
which
she
had
passed
had
left
have
been
so
cold
and
wicked
that
you
will
soon
scorn
me
do
not
think
that
is
possible
said
her
companion
gently
as
he
saw
the
girl
choking
back
a
sob
listen
then
helen
began
but
then
she
stopped
again
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
she
asked
you
care
anything
about
it
at
all
or
does
it
seem
care
very
much
about
it
indeed
the
other
answered
dreadful
it
may
seem
said
helen
please
know
that
while
i
have
been
doing
it
it
has
made
me
utterly
wretched
and
that
i
am
so
frightened
now
that
i
can
scarcely
talk
to
you
and
that
if
there
is
anything
that
i
can
do
oh
absolutely
anything
i
will
do
it
then
the
girl
bit
her
lips
together
and
went
on
with
desperate
haste
what
you
said
about
what
would
happen
if
there
were
someone
else
to
love
me
and
to
see
how
very
bad
i
was
is
some
such
person
asked
the
man
in
a
low
voice
said
she
is
someone
i
have
known
as
long
as
i
can
remember
and
he
loves
me
very
much
indeed
i
think
and
while
i
was
letting
myself
be
tempted
in
this
way
he
was
very
sick
and
because
i
knew
i
was
so
bad
i
did
not
dare
go
near
him
and
yesterday
when
he
heard
i
was
going
to
marry
this
man
it
almost
killed
him
and
i
do
not
know
what
to
fear
then
punishing
herself
very
bravely
and
swallowing
all
her
bitter
shame
helen
went
on
to
tell
howard
of
arthur
and
of
her
friendship
with
him
and
of
how
long
he
had
waited
for
her
she
narrated
in
a
few
words
how
he
had
left
her
and
then
how
she
had
seen
him
upon
the
road
afterwards
she
stopped
and
sat
very
still
trembling
and
with
her
eyes
lowered
quite
forgetting
that
she
was
driving
davis
said
the
other
gently
seeing
how
she
was
suffering
you
wish
my
advice
about
this
i
should
not
worry
myself
too
much
it
is
better
i
find
in
my
own
soul
life
to
save
most
of
the
time
that
one
spends
upon
remorse
and
devote
it
to
action
asked
helen
said
the
other
have
been
very
thoughtless
but
you
may
hope
that
nothing
irrevocable
has
happened
and
when
you
have
seen
your
friend
and
told
him
the
truth
just
as
you
have
told
it
to
me
i
fancy
it
will
bring
him
joy
enough
to
compensate
him
for
what
he
has
was
what
i
meant
to
do
the
girl
went
on
i
have
been
terrified
by
all
sorts
of
fancies
and
when
i
remember
how
much
pain
i
caused
him
i
scarcely
dare
think
of
speaking
to
him
when
i
saw
him
by
the
roadside
howard
he
seemed
to
me
to
look
exactly
like
you
there
was
such
dreadful
suffering
written
in
his
man
who
lives
as
you
have
told
me
your
friend
has
lived
said
the
other
usually
a
very
great
power
of
suffering
such
a
man
builds
for
himself
an
ideal
which
gives
him
all
his
joy
and
his
power
and
makes
his
life
a
very
glorious
thing
but
when
anything
happens
to
destroy
his
vision
or
to
keep
him
from
seeking
it
he
suffers
with
the
same
intensity
that
he
rejoiced
before
the
great
hunger
that
was
once
the
source
of
his
power
only
tears
him
to
pieces
then
as
steam
wrecks
a
broken
very
dreadful
helen
said
thoughtless
i
was
all
along
i
only
knew
that
he
loved
me
very
much
and
that
it
was
a
vexation
to
howard
glanced
at
her
do
not
love
him
he
asked
said
helen
quickly
i
had
loved
him
i
could
never
have
had
a
thought
of
all
these
other
things
but
i
had
no
wish
to
love
anybody
it
was
more
of
my
not
the
other
replied
gently
day
you
may
come
to
love
him
miss
do
not
know
helen
said
was
very
a
man
is
swift
and
eager
in
all
his
life
said
howard
smiling
can
not
well
be
otherwise
in
his
love
such
devotion
ought
to
be
very
precious
to
a
woman
for
such
hearts
are
not
easy
to
find
in
the
helen
had
turned
and
was
gazing
anxiously
at
howard
as
he
spoke
to
her
thus
really
think
she
said
i
should
learn
to
appreciate
arthur
love
can
not
know
much
about
him
from
the
little
you
have
told
me
was
the
other
answer
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
there
you
might
find
the
best
chance
to
become
the
unselfish
woman
that
you
wish
to
is
very
strange
the
girl
responded
wonderingly
differently
you
think
about
it
i
should
have
supposed
i
was
acting
very
unwisely
indeed
if
i
loved
arthur
everyone
would
have
told
me
of
his
poverty
and
obscurity
and
of
how
i
must
give
up
my
social
think
differently
perhaps
howard
said
i
have
lived
so
much
alone
i
have
come
to
know
that
happiness
is
a
thing
of
one
own
heart
and
not
of
externals
the
questions
i
should
ask
about
a
marriage
would
not
be
of
wealth
and
position
if
you
really
wish
to
seek
the
precious
things
of
the
soul
i
should
think
you
would
be
very
glad
to
prove
it
by
some
sacrifice
and
i
know
that
two
hearts
are
brought
closer
and
all
the
memories
of
life
made
dearer
by
some
such
trial
in
the
early
days
people
sneer
at
love
in
a
cottage
but
i
am
sure
that
love
that
could
wish
to
live
anywhere
else
is
not
love
and
as
to
the
social
career
a
person
who
has
once
come
to
know
the
life
of
the
heart
soon
ceases
to
care
for
any
kind
of
life
that
is
heartless
a
social
career
is
certainly
that
and
in
comparison
very
vulgar
helen
looked
a
little
puzzled
and
repeated
the
word
inquiringly
mr
howard
smiled
is
the
word
i
always
use
when
i
am
talking
about
high
life
he
said
laughing
may
hurl
the
words
and
at
it
all
you
please
and
never
reach
a
vital
spot
but
the
word
goes
straight
to
the
must
explain
to
me
why
it
is
that
said
helen
with
so
much
seriousness
that
the
other
could
not
help
smiling
again
i
can
not
make
anyone
else
see
the
thing
as
i
do
was
his
reply
yet
it
seems
rery
simple
when
a
man
lives
a
while
in
his
own
soul
he
becomes
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
certain
spiritual
fact
which
gives
life
all
its
dignity
and
meaning
he
learns
that
this
sacred
thing
demands
to
be
sought
for
and
worshiped
and
that
the
man
who
honors
it
and
seeks
it
is
only
hailed
as
gentleman
and
aristocrat
and
that
he
who
does
not
honor
it
and
seek
it
is
vulgar
tho
he
be
heir
of
a
hundred
earls
and
leader
of
all
society
and
lord
of
millions
every
day
that
one
lives
in
this
presence
that
i
speak
of
he
discovers
a
little
more
how
sacred
a
thing
is
true
nobility
and
how
impertinent
is
the
standard
that
values
men
for
the
wealth
they
win
or
for
the
ribbons
they
wear
or
for
anything
else
in
the
world
i
fancy
that
you
if
you
came
once
to
love
your
friend
would
find
it
very
easy
to
do
without
the
admiration
of
those
who
go
to
make
up
society
they
would
come
to
seem
to
you
very
trivial
and
empty
people
and
afterwards
perhaps
even
very
cruel
and
howard
stopped
but
then
seeing
that
helen
was
gazing
at
him
inquiringly
once
more
he
added
gravely
could
be
well
content
to
let
vain
people
strut
their
little
hour
and
be
as
wonderful
as
they
chose
if
it
were
not
for
the
painful
fact
that
they
are
eating
the
bread
of
honest
men
and
that
millions
are
toiling
and
starving
in
order
that
they
may
have
ease
and
luxury
that
is
such
a
very
dreadful
thing
to
know
that
sometimes
one
can
think
of
nothing
else
and
it
drives
him
quite
the
girl
sat
very
still
after
that
trembling
a
little
in
her
heart
finally
she
asked
her
voice
shaking
slightly
howard
what
can
one
do
about
such
things
little
was
the
reply
they
must
always
be
but
at
least
one
can
keep
his
own
life
earnest
and
true
a
woman
who
felt
such
things
very
keenly
might
be
an
inspiration
to
a
man
who
was
called
upon
to
battle
with
selfishness
and
are
thinking
of
arthur
once
more
asked
the
girl
answered
the
other
with
a
slight
smile
would
be
a
happy
memory
for
me
to
know
that
i
have
been
able
to
give
you
such
an
ideal
some
of
these
days
you
see
i
am
hoping
that
we
shall
again
have
a
poet
with
a
conviction
and
a
voice
so
that
men
may
know
that
sympathy
and
love
are
things
as
real
as
money
i
am
quite
sure
there
never
was
a
nation
so
ridiculously
sodden
as
our
own
just
at
present
all
of
our
maxims
and
ways
of
life
are
as
if
we
were
the
queer
little
niebelung
creatures
that
dig
for
treasure
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
see
no
farther
than
the
ends
of
their
shovels
we
live
in
the
city
of
god
and
spend
all
our
time
scraping
the
gold
of
the
pavements
your
uncle
told
me
this
morning
that
he
did
not
see
why
a
boy
should
go
to
college
when
he
can
get
a
higher
salary
if
he
spends
the
four
years
in
business
i
find
that
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
run
away
and
live
alone
if
one
wants
really
to
believe
that
man
is
a
spiritual
nature
with
an
infinite
possibility
of
wonder
and
love
and
that
the
one
business
of
his
life
is
to
develop
that
nature
by
contact
with
things
about
him
and
that
every
act
of
narrow
selfishness
he
commits
is
a
veil
which
he
ties
about
his
own
eyes
and
that
when
he
has
tied
enough
of
them
not
all
the
pearl
and
gold
of
the
gorgeous
east
can
make
him
less
a
pitiable
howard
stopped
again
and
smiled
slightly
helen
sat
gazing
thoughtfully
ahead
thinking
about
his
way
of
looking
at
life
and
how
very
strange
her
own
actions
seemed
in
the
light
of
it
suddenly
however
because
throughout
all
the
conversation
there
had
been
another
thought
in
her
consciousness
she
glanced
ahead
and
urged
the
horse
even
faster
she
saw
far
in
the
distance
the
houses
of
the
place
to
which
she
was
bound
and
she
said
nothing
more
her
companion
also
becoming
silent
as
he
perceived
her
agitation
helen
had
been
constantly
growing
more
anxious
so
that
now
the
carriage
could
not
travel
fast
enough
it
seemed
to
her
that
everything
depended
upon
what
she
might
find
at
hilltown
it
was
only
the
thought
of
arthur
that
kept
her
from
feeling
completely
free
from
her
wretchedness
she
felt
that
she
might
remedy
all
the
wrong
that
she
had
done
and
win
once
more
the
prize
of
a
good
conscience
provided
only
that
nothing
irretrievable
had
happened
to
him
now
as
she
came
nearer
she
found
herself
imagining
more
and
more
what
might
have
happened
and
becoming
more
and
more
impatient
there
was
a
balance
dangling
before
her
eyes
with
utter
happiness
on
one
side
and
utter
misery
on
the
other
the
issue
depended
upon
what
she
discovered
at
hilltown
the
two
sat
in
silence
both
thinking
of
the
same
thing
as
they
whirled
past
the
place
where
helen
had
seen
arthur
before
the
girl
trembled
as
she
glanced
at
it
for
all
of
the
previous
suffering
rose
before
her
again
and
made
her
fears
still
more
real
and
importunate
she
forced
herself
to
look
however
half
thinking
that
she
might
see
arthur
again
but
that
did
not
happen
and
in
a
minute
or
two
more
the
carriage
had
come
to
the
house
where
he
lived
she
gave
the
reins
to
howard
and
sprang
quickly
out
she
rang
the
bell
and
then
stood
for
a
minute
twitching
her
fingers
and
waiting
the
woman
who
kept
the
house
and
whom
helen
knew
personally
opened
the
door
the
visitor
stepped
in
and
gasped
out
breathlessly
is
arthur
her
hands
shook
visibly
as
she
waited
for
the
reply
is
not
in
miss
davis
the
woman
answered
is
he
helen
cried
do
not
know
was
the
response
has
and
the
girl
started
back
catching
at
her
heart
where
do
not
know
miss
what
began
the
other
will
tell
you
all
i
know
said
the
woman
as
she
fumbled
in
her
apron
and
put
a
scrap
of
crumpled
paper
into
helen
trembling
hands
the
girl
seized
it
and
glanced
at
it
then
she
staggered
back
against
the
wall
ghastly
pale
and
almost
sinking
the
note
in
arthur
hand
but
so
unsteady
as
to
be
almost
illegible
ran
thus
will
find
in
this
my
board
for
the
past
week
i
am
compelled
to
leave
hilltown
and
i
shall
not
ever
and
that
was
all
helen
stared
at
it
and
stared
again
and
then
let
it
fall
and
gazed
about
her
echoing
in
a
hollow
voice
i
shall
not
ever
return
is
all
i
can
tell
you
about
it
went
on
the
woman
have
not
seen
him
since
elizabeth
was
here
yesterday
morning
he
came
back
late
last
night
and
packed
his
bag
and
went
helen
sank
down
upon
a
chair
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
quite
overwhelmed
by
the
suddenness
of
that
discovery
she
remained
thus
for
a
long
time
without
either
sound
or
motion
and
the
woman
stood
watching
her
knowing
full
well
what
was
the
matter
when
helen
looked
up
again
there
was
agony
written
upon
her
countenance
are
you
sure
you
have
no
idea
where
i
can
find
him
she
moaned
miss
davis
said
the
woman
was
asounded
when
i
got
this
someone
must
know
oh
surely
they
must
someone
must
have
seen
him
or
he
must
have
told
someone
think
it
likely
that
he
took
care
not
to
was
the
reply
the
thought
was
a
to
helen
last
hope
and
she
sank
down
quite
overcome
she
knew
that
arthur
could
have
had
but
one
motive
in
acting
as
he
had
that
he
meant
to
cut
himself
off
entirely
from
all
his
old
life
and
surroundings
he
had
no
friends
in
hilltown
and
having
lived
all
alone
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
do
it
helen
remembered
howard
saying
of
the
night
before
how
the
sight
of
her
baseness
might
wreck
a
man
life
forever
and
the
more
she
thought
of
that
the
more
it
made
her
tremble
it
seemed
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
to
see
this
fearful
consequence
of
her
sin
and
to
know
that
it
had
become
a
fact
of
the
outer
world
and
gone
beyond
her
power
it
seemed
quite
too
cruel
that
she
should
have
such
a
thing
on
her
conscience
and
have
it
there
forever
most
maddening
of
all
was
the
thought
that
it
had
depended
upon
a
few
hours
of
time
how
can
i
have
waited
she
moaned
should
have
come
last
night
i
should
have
stopped
the
carriage
when
i
saw
him
oh
it
is
not
possible
perhaps
there
are
no
more
tragic
words
in
human
speech
than
helen
felt
just
then
as
if
the
right
even
to
repentance
were
taken
from
her
life
it
was
her
first
introduction
to
that
fearful
thing
of
which
howard
had
told
her
upon
their
first
meeting
in
the
deep
loneliness
of
her
own
heart
helen
was
face
to
face
just
then
with
fate
she
shrank
back
in
terror
and
she
struggled
frantically
but
she
felt
its
grip
of
steel
about
her
wrist
and
while
she
sat
there
with
her
face
hidden
she
was
learning
to
gaze
into
its
eyes
and
front
their
fiery
terror
when
she
looked
up
again
her
face
was
very
white
and
pitiful
to
see
and
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
went
toward
the
door
so
unsteadily
that
the
woman
put
her
arm
about
her
will
tell
me
she
gasped
faintly
will
tell
me
if
you
hear
anything
said
the
other
gently
so
helen
crept
into
the
carriage
again
looking
so
full
of
wretchedness
that
her
companion
knew
that
the
worst
must
have
happened
and
took
the
reins
and
silently
drove
towards
home
while
the
girl
sat
perfectly
still
they
were
fully
half
way
home
before
she
could
find
a
word
in
which
to
tell
him
of
her
misery
shall
never
be
happy
in
my
life
again
she
whispered
howard
never
in
my
life
when
the
man
gazed
at
her
he
was
frightened
to
see
how
grief
and
fear
had
taken
possession
of
her
face
and
yet
there
was
no
word
that
he
could
say
to
soothe
her
and
no
hope
that
he
could
give
her
when
the
drive
was
ended
she
stole
silently
up
to
her
room
to
be
alone
with
her
misery
once
more
chapter
xi
majestic
in
thy
upon
the
present
occasion
there
was
no
violent
demonstration
of
emotion
to
alarm
the
roberts
household
for
helen
grief
was
not
of
the
kind
to
vent
itself
in
a
passionate
outburst
and
pass
away
to
be
sure
she
wept
a
little
but
the
thoughts
which
haunted
her
were
not
of
a
kind
to
be
forgotten
and
afterwards
she
was
as
wretched
as
ever
what
she
had
done
seemed
to
her
so
dreadful
that
even
tears
were
not
right
and
she
felt
that
she
ought
only
to
sit
still
and
think
of
it
and
be
frightened
it
seemed
to
her
just
then
as
if
she
would
have
to
do
the
same
thing
for
the
rest
of
her
days
she
spent
several
hours
in
her
room
without
once
moving
and
without
being
disturbed
for
her
aunt
was
sufficiently
annoyed
at
her
reception
not
to
visit
her
again
the
lunch
hour
passed
therefore
unthought
of
by
helen
and
it
was
an
hour
or
two
later
before
she
heard
her
aunt
step
in
the
hall
and
her
knock
upon
the
door
roberts
entered
and
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
gazing
at
helen
and
at
the
look
of
helpless
despair
which
she
turned
towards
her
the
woman
own
lips
were
set
very
tightly
she
said
abruptly
you
had
your
wish
and
are
you
happy
helen
did
not
answer
nor
did
she
half
realize
the
question
so
lost
was
she
in
her
own
misery
she
sat
gazing
at
her
aunt
while
the
latter
went
on
have
had
your
way
in
one
thing
at
any
rate
helen
harrison
is
downstairs
to
see
the
girl
gave
a
slight
start
but
then
she
answered
quietly
you
auntie
i
shall
go
down
and
see
said
roberts
you
still
refuse
to
tell
me
anything
of
what
i
ask
you
helen
was
quite
too
much
humbled
to
wish
to
oppose
anyone
just
then
and
she
answered
mournfully
is
it
that
you
wish
wish
to
know
in
the
first
place
why
you
wanted
to
see
wanted
to
see
him
to
tell
him
that
i
could
not
marry
him
aunt
and
roberts
sat
down
opposite
helen
and
fixed
her
gaze
upon
her
knew
that
was
it
she
said
grimly
helen
what
in
the
world
has
come
over
you
to
make
you
behave
in
this
fashion
it
is
so
much
to
tell
you
began
the
girl
do
know
did
you
find
at
hilltown
went
on
her
aunt
persistently
you
see
arthur
aunt
polly
that
is
what
is
the
matter
he
has
gone
where
aunt
polly
nobody
saw
him
go
and
he
left
a
note
saying
that
he
would
never
return
and
i
am
so
frightened
roberts
was
gazing
at
her
niece
with
a
puzzled
look
upon
her
face
she
interrupted
her
by
echoing
the
word
inquiringly
auntie
cried
the
girl
i
may
never
be
able
to
find
him
again
to
undo
what
i
have
done
and
roberts
responded
with
a
wondering
laugh
and
observed
my
part
i
should
think
you
be
very
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
she
saw
helen
give
a
start
but
she
could
not
read
the
girl
mind
and
did
not
know
how
much
she
had
done
to
estrange
her
by
those
words
it
was
as
if
helen
whole
soul
had
shrunk
back
in
horror
and
she
sat
staring
at
her
aunt
with
open
eyes
suppose
you
think
the
other
went
on
grimly
i
am
going
to
share
all
this
wonderful
sentimentality
with
you
about
that
boy
but
i
assure
you
that
you
do
know
me
he
may
get
you
to
weep
over
him
because
he
chooses
to
behave
like
a
fool
but
not
helen
was
still
for
a
moment
and
then
she
said
in
an
voice
polly
i
have
wrecked
arthur
life
roberts
responded
with
a
loud
guffaw
which
was
to
the
other
so
offensive
that
it
was
like
a
blow
in
the
face
his
life
the
woman
cried
scornfully
you
talk
like
a
baby
ca
you
know
in
the
first
place
that
arthur
is
doing
all
this
acting
for
nothing
in
the
world
but
to
frighten
you
wrecked
his
life
and
there
you
were
i
suppose
all
ready
to
get
down
on
your
knees
to
him
and
beg
his
pardon
for
daring
to
be
engaged
and
to
promise
to
come
to
his
attic
and
live
off
bread
and
water
if
he
would
only
be
good
and
not
run
away
roberts
voice
was
bitter
and
mocking
and
her
words
seemed
to
helen
almost
blasphemy
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
such
grief
as
hers
would
not
be
sacred
to
anyone
yet
there
was
no
thought
of
anger
in
her
mind
just
then
for
she
had
been
chastened
in
a
fiery
furnace
and
was
too
full
of
penitence
and
humility
for
even
that
much
egotism
she
only
bowed
her
head
and
said
in
a
trembling
voice
aunt
polly
i
would
stay
in
an
attic
and
live
off
bread
and
water
for
the
rest
of
my
days
if
i
could
only
clear
my
conscience
of
the
dreadful
thing
i
have
beautiful
sentiment
indeed
said
roberts
with
a
sniff
of
disgust
and
she
stood
surveying
her
niece
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
then
smothering
her
feelings
a
little
she
asked
her
in
a
quieter
voice
so
helen
you
are
really
going
to
fling
aside
the
life
opportunity
that
is
yours
for
such
nonsense
as
this
there
is
no
other
reason
is
another
reason
aunt
polly
said
helen
is
so
dreadful
of
you
to
ask
me
in
that
way
how
can
you
have
expected
me
to
marry
a
man
just
because
he
was
rich
said
the
other
that
is
it
and
pray
what
put
the
idea
into
your
head
so
suddenly
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
as
the
girl
did
not
raise
her
head
she
went
on
sarcastically
fancy
i
know
pretty
well
where
you
got
all
of
these
wonderful
new
ideas
you
have
not
been
talking
with
howard
for
nothing
i
not
for
nothing
said
helen
gently
nice
state
of
affairs
continued
the
other
angrily
knew
pretty
well
that
his
head
was
full
of
nonsense
but
when
i
asked
him
here
i
thought
at
least
that
he
would
know
enough
about
good
manners
to
mind
his
own
affairs
so
he
has
been
talking
to
you
has
he
and
now
you
can
not
possibly
marry
a
rich
man
roberts
stopped
quite
too
angry
to
find
any
more
words
but
as
she
sat
for
a
minute
or
two
gazing
at
helen
it
must
have
occurred
to
her
that
she
would
not
accomplish
anything
in
that
way
she
made
an
effort
to
swallow
her
emotions
dear
she
said
sitting
down
near
her
niece
will
you
worry
me
in
this
dreadful
way
and
make
me
speak
so
crossly
to
you
i
can
not
tell
you
helen
what
a
torment
it
is
to
me
to
see
you
throwing
yourself
away
in
this
fashion
i
implore
you
to
stop
and
think
before
you
take
this
step
for
as
sure
as
you
are
alive
you
will
regret
it
all
your
days
just
think
of
it
how
you
will
feel
and
how
i
will
feel
when
you
look
back
at
the
happiness
you
might
have
had
and
know
that
it
is
too
late
and
helen
it
is
due
to
nothing
in
the
world
but
to
your
inexperience
that
you
have
let
yourself
be
carried
away
by
these
sublimities
you
must
know
child
and
you
can
see
if
you
choose
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
life
they
will
not
butter
your
bread
helen
or
pay
your
coachman
and
when
you
get
over
all
this
excitement
you
will
find
that
what
i
tell
you
is
true
look
about
you
in
the
world
and
where
can
you
find
anybody
who
lives
according
to
such
ideas
ideas
do
you
mean
aunt
polly
asked
helen
with
a
puzzled
look
do
you
suppose
answered
the
other
i
know
perfectly
well
what
kind
of
stuff
it
is
that
howard
has
talked
to
you
i
used
to
hear
all
that
kind
of
thing
when
i
was
young
and
i
believed
some
of
it
too
about
how
beautiful
it
was
to
marry
for
love
and
to
have
a
fine
scorn
of
wealth
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
it
very
long
before
i
found
out
that
such
opinions
were
of
no
use
in
the
you
do
believe
in
love
aunt
polly
asked
helen
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
other
the
use
of
asking
such
an
absurd
question
was
the
answer
course
i
believe
in
love
i
wanted
you
to
love
harrison
and
you
might
have
if
you
had
chosen
i
learned
to
love
roberts
naturally
a
couple
have
to
love
each
other
or
how
would
they
ever
live
happily
together
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
this
ridiculous
talk
of
howard
as
if
two
people
had
nothing
else
to
do
in
the
world
but
to
love
each
other
it
all
very
well
helen
for
a
man
who
chooses
to
live
like
robinson
crusoe
to
talk
such
nonsense
but
he
ought
not
to
put
it
in
the
mind
of
a
sentimental
girl
he
would
very
soon
find
if
he
came
out
into
life
that
the
world
is
run
by
love
and
that
people
need
a
good
many
other
things
to
keep
them
happy
in
it
you
ought
to
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
you
got
to
live
a
different
sort
of
a
life
and
that
howard
knows
nothing
in
the
world
about
your
needs
i
do
go
alone
and
live
in
visions
and
make
myself
imaginary
lives
helen
i
look
at
the
world
as
it
is
you
will
have
to
learn
some
day
that
the
real
way
to
find
happiness
is
to
take
things
as
you
find
them
and
get
the
best
out
of
life
you
can
i
never
had
of
your
advantages
and
yet
there
are
many
people
in
the
world
better
off
than
i
am
and
you
could
be
just
as
happy
if
you
would
only
take
my
advice
about
it
what
i
am
talking
to
you
is
common
sense
helen
and
anybody
that
you
choose
to
ask
will
tell
you
the
same
so
roberts
went
on
quite
fairly
under
way
in
her
usual
course
of
argument
and
rousing
all
her
faculties
for
this
last
struggle
she
was
as
convinced
as
ever
of
the
completeness
of
her
own
views
and
of
the
effect
which
they
must
have
upon
helen
perhaps
it
was
not
her
fault
that
she
did
not
know
to
what
another
person
she
was
talking
in
truth
it
would
not
be
easy
to
tell
how
great
a
difference
there
was
in
the
effect
of
those
old
arguments
upon
helen
while
she
had
been
sitting
in
her
room
alone
and
suffering
so
very
keenly
the
girl
had
been
though
she
did
not
know
it
very
near
indeed
to
the
sacred
truths
of
life
and
now
as
she
listened
to
her
aunt
she
was
simply
holding
her
breath
the
climax
came
suddenly
for
as
the
other
stopped
helen
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
and
gazing
deep
into
her
eyes
asked
her
polly
can
it
really
be
that
you
do
not
know
that
what
you
have
been
saying
to
me
is
dreadfully
there
was
perhaps
nothing
that
the
girl
could
have
done
to
take
her
complacent
relative
more
by
surprise
roberts
sat
for
a
moment
echoing
the
last
word
and
staring
as
if
not
quite
able
to
realize
what
helen
meant
as
the
truth
came
to
her
she
turned
quite
pale
seems
to
me
she
said
with
a
sneer
i
remember
a
time
when
it
did
seem
quite
so
wicked
to
you
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
were
quite
glad
to
do
all
that
i
told
you
and
to
get
as
much
as
ever
you
helen
was
quite
used
to
that
taunt
in
her
own
heart
and
to
the
pain
that
it
brought
her
so
she
only
lowered
her
eyes
and
said
nothing
in
the
meantime
roberts
was
going
on
in
her
sarcastic
tone
indeed
she
ejaculated
i
suppose
all
that
i
have
been
doing
for
you
was
wicked
too
i
suppose
it
was
wicked
of
me
to
watch
over
your
education
all
these
years
as
i
have
and
to
plan
your
future
as
if
you
were
my
own
child
so
that
you
might
amount
to
something
in
the
world
and
it
was
wicked
of
me
to
take
all
the
trouble
that
i
have
for
your
happiness
and
wicked
of
roberts
to
go
to
all
the
trouble
about
the
trousseau
that
he
has
the
only
right
and
virtuous
thing
about
it
all
is
the
conduct
of
our
niece
who
causes
us
to
do
it
all
and
who
promises
herself
to
a
man
and
lets
him
go
to
all
the
trouble
that
he
has
and
then
gets
her
head
full
of
sanctimonious
notions
and
begins
to
preach
about
wickedness
to
her
elders
helen
had
nothing
to
reply
to
those
bitter
words
for
it
was
only
too
easy
just
then
to
make
her
accuse
herself
of
anything
she
sat
meekly
suffering
and
thinking
that
the
other
was
quite
justified
in
all
her
anger
roberts
was
of
course
quite
incapable
of
appreciating
her
mood
and
continued
to
pour
out
her
sarcasm
and
to
grow
more
and
more
bitter
to
tell
the
truth
the
worthy
matron
had
not
been
half
so
unselfish
in
her
hopes
about
helen
as
she
liked
to
pretend
and
she
showed
then
that
like
most
people
of
the
world
who
are
perfectly
on
the
surface
she
could
display
no
little
ugliness
when
thwarted
in
her
ambitions
and
offended
in
her
pride
it
was
not
possible
however
for
her
to
find
a
word
that
could
seem
to
helen
unjust
so
much
was
the
girl
already
humbled
it
was
only
after
her
aunt
had
ceased
to
direct
her
taunts
at
her
and
turned
her
spite
upon
howard
and
his
superior
ideas
that
it
seemed
to
helen
that
it
was
not
helping
her
to
hear
any
more
then
she
rose
and
said
very
gently
polly
i
am
sorry
that
you
feel
so
about
me
and
i
wish
that
i
could
explain
to
you
better
what
i
am
doing
i
know
that
what
i
did
at
first
was
all
wrong
but
that
is
no
reason
why
i
should
leave
it
wrong
forever
i
think
now
that
i
ought
to
go
and
talk
to
harrison
who
is
waiting
for
me
and
after
that
i
want
you
to
please
send
me
home
because
father
will
be
there
and
i
want
to
tell
him
about
how
dreadfully
i
have
treated
arthur
and
beg
him
to
forgive
then
without
waiting
for
any
reply
the
girl
left
the
room
and
went
slowly
down
the
steps
the
sorrow
that
possessed
her
lay
so
deep
upon
her
heart
that
everything
else
seemed
trivial
in
comparison
and
she
had
put
aside
and
forgotten
the
whole
scene
with
her
aunt
before
she
had
reached
the
parlor
where
harrison
was
waiting
she
did
not
stop
to
compose
herself
or
to
think
what
to
say
but
went
quickly
into
the
room
harrison
who
was
standing
by
the
window
turned
when
he
heard
her
she
answered
his
greeting
kindly
and
then
sat
down
and
remained
very
still
for
a
moment
or
two
gazing
at
her
hands
in
her
lap
at
last
she
raised
her
eyes
to
him
and
asked
harrison
did
you
receive
the
letter
i
wrote
you
the
other
answered
quickly
did
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
pain
it
caused
me
and
helen
or
must
i
call
you
miss
davis
may
call
me
helen
said
the
girl
simply
was
very
sorry
to
cause
you
pain
she
added
there
was
nothing
else
that
i
could
least
the
other
responded
hope
that
you
will
not
refuse
to
explain
to
me
why
this
step
is
necessary
harrison
said
helen
is
right
that
i
should
tell
you
all
no
matter
how
hard
it
is
to
me
to
do
it
it
is
all
because
of
a
great
wrong
that
i
have
done
i
know
that
when
i
have
told
you
you
will
think
very
badly
of
me
indeed
but
i
have
no
right
to
do
anything
except
to
speak
the
she
said
that
in
a
very
low
voice
not
allowing
her
eyes
to
drop
and
wearing
upon
her
face
the
look
of
sadness
which
seemed
now
to
belong
to
it
always
harrison
gazed
at
her
anxiously
and
said
seem
to
have
been
ill
have
been
very
unhappy
harrison
she
answered
i
do
not
believe
i
can
ever
be
otherwise
again
did
you
not
notice
that
i
was
unhappy
never
thought
of
it
until
yesterday
the
other
replied
the
drive
said
helen
was
the
climax
of
it
i
must
tell
you
the
reason
why
i
was
so
frightened
then
that
i
have
a
friend
who
was
as
dear
to
me
as
if
he
were
my
brother
and
he
loved
me
very
much
very
much
more
than
i
deserve
to
be
loved
by
anyone
and
when
i
was
engaged
to
you
he
was
very
ill
and
because
i
knew
i
was
doing
so
wrong
i
did
not
dare
to
go
and
see
him
that
was
why
i
was
afraid
to
pass
through
hilltown
the
reason
i
was
so
frightened
afterwards
is
that
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
and
he
was
in
such
a
dreadful
way
this
morning
i
found
that
he
had
left
his
home
and
gone
away
no
one
knows
where
so
that
i
fear
i
shall
never
see
him
helen
paused
and
the
other
who
had
sat
down
and
was
leaning
forward
anxiously
asked
her
it
is
this
friend
that
you
love
the
girl
replied
is
not
that
i
do
not
love
then
i
do
not
understand
went
on
harrison
with
a
puzzled
look
spoke
of
its
having
been
so
wrong
was
it
not
your
right
to
wish
to
marry
me
and
helen
punishing
herself
as
she
had
learned
so
bravely
to
do
did
not
lower
her
eyes
even
then
she
flushed
somewhat
however
as
she
answered
harrison
do
you
know
why
i
wished
to
marry
you
the
other
started
a
trifle
and
looked
very
much
at
a
loss
indeed
he
echoed
i
do
not
know
that
is
i
never
thought
hurts
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
to
have
to
say
this
to
you
helen
said
you
were
right
and
true
in
your
feeling
but
did
you
think
that
i
was
that
harrison
did
you
think
that
i
really
loved
you
probably
the
good
man
had
never
been
more
embarrassed
in
his
life
than
he
was
just
then
the
truth
to
be
told
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
why
helen
had
wished
to
marry
him
and
had
been
all
along
without
seeing
anything
in
that
for
which
to
dislike
her
he
was
quite
without
an
answer
to
her
present
question
and
could
only
cough
and
stammer
and
reach
for
his
handkerchief
the
girl
went
on
quickly
without
waiting
very
long
for
his
reply
owe
it
to
you
to
tell
you
the
truth
she
said
then
it
will
no
longer
cause
you
pain
to
give
me
up
for
i
did
not
love
you
at
all
harrison
but
i
loved
all
that
you
offered
me
and
i
allowed
myself
to
be
tempted
thus
to
promise
to
marry
you
ever
afterwards
i
was
quite
wretched
because
i
knew
that
i
was
doing
something
wicked
and
yet
i
never
had
the
courage
to
stop
so
it
went
on
until
my
punishment
came
yesterday
i
have
suffered
fearfully
since
helen
had
said
all
that
there
was
to
be
said
and
she
stopped
and
took
a
deep
breath
of
relief
there
was
a
minute
or
two
of
silence
after
which
harrison
asked
you
really
think
that
it
was
so
wrong
to
promise
to
marry
me
for
the
happiness
that
i
could
offer
you
helen
gazed
at
him
in
surprise
as
she
echoed
it
so
wrong
and
at
the
same
moment
even
while
she
was
speaking
a
memory
flashed
across
her
mind
the
memory
of
what
had
occurred
at
fairview
the
last
time
she
had
been
there
with
harrison
a
deep
burning
blush
mantled
her
face
and
her
eyes
dropped
and
she
trembled
visibly
it
was
a
better
response
to
the
other
question
than
any
words
could
have
been
and
because
in
spite
of
his
contact
with
the
world
he
was
still
in
his
heart
a
gentleman
he
understood
and
changed
color
himself
and
looked
away
feeling
perhaps
more
rebuked
and
humbled
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
life
before
so
they
sat
thus
for
several
minutes
without
speaking
a
word
or
looking
at
each
other
each
doing
penance
in
his
own
heart
at
last
in
a
very
low
voice
the
man
said
i
do
not
know
just
how
i
can
ever
apologize
to
the
girl
answered
quietly
could
not
let
you
apologize
to
me
harrison
for
i
never
once
thought
that
you
had
done
anything
have
done
very
wrong
indeed
he
answered
his
voice
trembling
i
do
not
think
that
i
had
any
right
even
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
you
make
me
feel
suddenly
how
very
coarse
a
world
i
have
lived
in
and
how
much
lower
than
yours
all
my
ways
of
thinking
are
you
look
surprised
that
i
say
that
he
added
as
he
saw
that
the
girl
was
about
to
interrupt
him
you
do
not
know
much
about
the
world
do
you
suppose
that
there
are
many
women
in
society
who
would
hesitate
to
marry
me
for
my
money
do
not
know
said
helen
slowly
harrison
you
could
certainly
never
be
happy
with
a
woman
who
would
do
do
not
think
now
that
i
should
the
man
replied
earnestly
i
did
not
feel
that
way
before
i
did
not
have
much
else
to
offer
helen
for
money
is
all
that
a
man
like
me
ever
tries
to
get
in
the
is
so
very
wrong
harrison
put
in
the
other
quickly
people
live
in
that
way
they
come
to
lose
sight
of
all
that
is
right
and
beautiful
in
life
and
it
is
all
so
selfish
and
wicked
those
were
words
which
might
have
made
howard
smile
a
trifle
had
he
been
there
to
hear
them
but
helen
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
think
about
being
original
know
said
harrison
i
used
to
believe
in
such
things
but
one
never
meets
anyone
else
that
does
and
it
is
so
easy
to
live
differently
when
you
spoke
to
me
as
you
did
just
now
you
made
me
seem
a
very
poor
kind
of
a
person
the
man
paused
and
helen
sat
gazing
at
him
with
a
worried
look
upon
her
face
was
not
that
which
i
meant
to
do
she
began
but
then
she
stopped
and
after
a
long
silence
harrison
took
up
the
conversation
again
speaking
in
a
low
earnest
voice
he
said
have
made
me
see
that
i
am
quite
unworthy
to
ask
for
your
regard
that
i
have
really
nothing
fit
to
offer
you
but
i
might
have
one
thing
that
you
could
appreciate
for
i
could
worship
really
worship
such
a
woman
as
you
and
i
could
do
everything
that
i
could
think
of
to
make
myself
worthy
of
you
even
if
it
meant
the
changing
of
all
my
ways
of
life
do
you
not
suppose
that
you
could
quite
forget
that
i
was
a
rich
man
helen
and
still
let
me
be
devoted
to
you
there
was
a
look
in
harrison
eyes
as
he
gazed
at
her
just
then
which
made
him
seem
to
her
a
different
sort
of
a
man
as
indeed
he
was
she
answered
very
gently
harrison
she
said
would
be
a
great
happiness
to
me
to
know
that
anyone
felt
so
about
me
but
i
could
never
marry
you
i
do
not
love
you
do
not
think
asked
the
other
you
could
ever
come
to
love
me
no
matter
how
long
i
might
wait
do
not
think
so
helen
said
in
a
low
voice
wish
that
you
would
not
ever
think
of
me
is
very
easy
to
say
that
the
man
answered
pleadingly
how
am
i
to
do
it
for
everything
that
i
have
seems
cheap
compared
with
the
thought
of
you
why
should
i
go
on
with
the
life
i
have
been
leading
heaping
up
wealth
that
i
do
not
know
how
to
use
and
that
makes
me
no
better
and
no
happier
i
thought
of
you
as
a
new
motive
for
going
on
helen
and
you
must
know
that
a
man
can
not
so
easily
change
his
feelings
for
i
really
loved
you
and
i
do
love
you
still
and
i
think
that
i
always
must
love
helen
own
suffering
had
made
her
alive
to
other
people
feelings
and
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
he
spoke
those
words
moved
her
very
much
she
leaned
over
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
something
which
she
would
not
have
thought
she
could
ever
do
harrison
she
said
can
not
tell
you
how
much
it
hurts
me
to
have
you
speak
to
me
so
for
it
makes
me
see
more
than
ever
how
cruelly
unfeeling
i
have
been
and
how
much
i
have
wronged
you
it
was
for
that
i
wished
to
beg
you
to
forgive
me
to
forgive
me
just
out
of
the
goodness
of
your
heart
for
i
can
not
offer
any
excuse
for
what
i
did
it
makes
me
quite
wretched
to
have
to
say
that
and
to
know
that
others
are
suffering
because
of
my
selfishness
if
i
had
any
thought
of
the
sacredness
of
the
beauty
god
has
given
me
i
would
never
have
let
you
think
of
me
as
you
did
and
caused
you
the
pain
that
i
have
but
you
must
forgive
me
harrison
and
help
me
for
to
think
of
your
being
unhappy
about
me
also
would
be
really
more
than
i
could
bear
sometimes
when
i
think
of
the
one
great
sorrow
that
i
have
already
upon
my
conscience
i
feel
that
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
to
do
and
you
must
go
away
and
forget
about
me
for
my
sake
if
not
for
your
own
i
really
can
not
love
anyone
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
fit
to
love
anyone
i
only
do
not
want
to
make
anyone
else
and
helen
stopped
again
and
pressed
her
hand
upon
imploringly
he
sat
gazing
at
her
in
silence
for
a
minute
and
then
he
said
slowly
you
put
it
so
it
is
very
hard
for
me
to
say
anything
more
if
you
are
only
sure
that
that
is
your
final
word
that
there
is
really
no
chance
that
you
could
ever
love
me
am
perfectly
sure
of
it
the
girl
answered
because
i
know
how
cruel
it
sounds
it
is
harder
for
me
to
say
than
for
you
to
hear
but
it
is
really
the
truth
harrison
i
do
not
think
that
you
ought
to
see
me
again
until
you
are
sure
that
it
will
not
make
you
the
man
sat
for
a
moment
after
that
with
his
head
bowed
and
then
he
bit
his
lip
very
hard
and
rose
from
his
chair
can
never
know
he
said
lonely
it
makes
a
man
feel
to
hear
words
like
but
he
took
helen
hand
in
his
and
held
it
for
an
instant
and
then
added
shall
do
as
you
ask
me
and
he
let
her
hand
fall
and
went
to
the
door
there
he
stopped
to
gaze
once
again
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
and
disappeared
closing
the
door
behind
him
helen
was
left
seated
in
the
chair
where
she
remained
for
several
minutes
leaning
forward
with
her
head
in
her
hands
and
gazing
steadily
in
front
of
her
thinking
very
grave
thoughts
she
rose
at
last
however
and
brushed
back
the
hair
from
her
forehead
and
went
slowly
towards
the
door
it
would
have
seemed
lack
of
feeling
to
her
had
she
thought
of
it
but
even
before
she
had
reached
the
stairs
the
scene
through
which
she
had
just
passed
was
gone
from
her
mind
entirely
and
she
was
saying
to
herself
i
could
only
know
where
arthur
is
this
afternoon
her
mind
was
still
full
of
that
thought
when
she
entered
the
room
where
she
found
her
aunt
seated
just
as
she
had
left
her
and
in
no
more
pleasant
humor
than
before
have
told
him
i
suppose
she
inquired
helen
said
have
told
him
aunt
now
you
are
happy
i
suppose
indeed
i
am
very
far
from
that
said
helen
and
she
went
to
the
window
she
stood
there
gazing
out
but
with
her
thoughts
equally
far
away
from
the
scene
outside
as
from
warnings
and
sarcasms
the
latter
had
gone
on
for
several
minutes
before
her
niece
turned
suddenly
me
for
interrupting
you
aunt
polly
she
said
i
want
to
know
whether
howard
has
gone
train
goes
in
an
hour
or
so
said
roberts
not
very
graciously
think
i
will
see
if
he
is
downstairs
helen
responded
wish
to
speak
to
him
before
he
and
so
she
descended
and
found
howard
seated
alone
upon
the
piazza
taking
a
seat
beside
him
she
said
did
not
thank
you
when
i
left
you
in
the
carriage
howard
for
having
been
so
kind
to
me
but
i
was
so
wrapped
up
in
my
worry
understood
perfectly
put
in
the
other
saw
that
you
felt
too
keenly
about
your
discovery
to
have
anything
to
say
to
feel
no
less
keenly
about
it
now
said
helen
i
could
not
let
you
go
away
until
i
had
spoken
to
she
gazed
very
earnestly
at
him
as
she
continued
have
to
tell
you
how
much
you
have
done
for
me
and
how
i
thank
you
for
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
simply
can
not
say
how
much
all
that
you
have
shown
me
has
meant
to
me
i
should
have
cared
for
nothing
but
to
have
you
tell
me
what
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
do
with
my
life
if
only
it
had
not
been
for
this
dreadful
misfortune
of
arthur
which
makes
it
seem
as
if
it
would
be
wicked
for
me
to
think
about
howard
sat
gazing
in
front
of
him
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
gently
if
the
change
that
you
speak
of
were
to
be
accomplished
miss
davis
without
your
ever
thinking
about
it
for
what
is
it
that
makes
the
difference
between
being
thoughtless
and
selfish
and
being
noble
and
good
if
it
be
not
simply
to
walk
reverently
in
god
great
temple
of
life
and
to
think
with
sorrow
of
one
own
self
believe
me
my
dear
friend
the
best
men
that
have
lived
on
earth
have
seen
no
more
cause
to
be
pleased
with
themselves
than
may
be
true
howard
said
helen
sadly
it
can
do
me
no
good
to
know
it
it
does
not
make
what
happens
to
arthur
a
bit
less
dreadful
to
think
is
the
most
painful
fact
about
all
our
wrong
the
other
answered
no
amount
of
repentance
can
ever
alter
the
consequences
but
miss
davis
that
is
a
guilt
which
all
creation
carries
on
its
shoulders
it
is
what
is
symbolized
in
the
fall
of
man
that
he
has
to
realize
that
he
might
have
had
infinite
beauty
and
joy
for
his
portion
if
only
the
soul
within
him
had
never
weakened
and
failed
let
me
tell
you
that
he
is
a
lucky
man
who
can
look
back
at
all
his
life
and
see
no
more
shameful
guilt
than
yours
and
no
consequence
worse
than
yours
can
as
howard
spoke
he
saw
a
startled
look
cross
the
girl
face
and
he
added
not
suppose
that
i
am
saying
that
to
comfort
you
for
it
is
really
the
truth
it
oftens
happens
too
that
the
natures
that
are
strongest
and
most
ardent
in
their
search
for
righteousness
have
the
worst
sins
to
helen
did
not
answer
for
several
moments
for
the
thought
was
strange
to
her
then
suddenly
she
gazed
at
the
other
very
earnestly
and
said
howard
you
are
a
man
who
lives
for
what
is
beautiful
and
high
suppose
that
you
had
to
carry
all
through
your
life
the
burden
of
such
guilt
as
mine
the
man
voice
was
trembling
slightly
as
he
answered
her
is
not
hard
for
me
to
suppose
that
miss
davis
i
have
such
a
burden
to
as
he
raised
his
eyes
he
saw
a
still
more
wondering
look
upon
her
countenance
the
consequences
she
exclaimed
howard
you
could
not
bear
to
live
if
you
knew
have
never
known
the
consequences
said
the
man
as
she
stopped
abruptly
as
you
may
never
know
them
but
this
i
know
that
yours
could
not
be
so
dreadful
as
mine
must
be
i
know
also
that
i
am
far
more
to
blame
for
them
than
helen
could
not
have
told
what
caused
the
emotion
which
made
her
shudder
so
just
then
as
she
gazed
into
howard
dark
eyes
her
voice
was
almost
a
whisper
as
she
said
yet
you
are
good
am
good
said
the
man
gently
all
the
goodness
that
any
man
can
claim
the
goodness
of
trying
to
be
better
you
may
be
that
helen
sat
for
a
long
time
in
silence
after
that
wondering
at
what
was
passing
in
her
own
mind
it
was
as
if
she
had
caught
a
sudden
glimpse
into
a
great
vista
of
life
she
had
always
before
thought
of
this
man
suffering
as
having
been
physical
and
the
deep
movement
of
sympathy
and
awe
which
stirred
her
now
was
one
step
farther
from
her
own
and
one
step
nearer
to
the
suffering
that
is
the
heart
of
things
but
helen
had
to
keep
that
thought
and
dwell
upon
it
in
solitude
there
was
no
chance
for
her
to
talk
with
howard
any
more
for
she
heard
her
aunt
step
in
the
hall
behind
her
she
had
only
time
to
say
am
going
home
myself
this
afternoon
will
you
come
there
to
see
me
howard
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
pleasure
it
would
give
is
nothing
i
should
like
to
do
more
the
man
answered
hope
to
keep
your
friendship
when
would
you
like
me
to
come
time
that
you
can
replied
helen
soon
for
i
know
how
unhappy
i
shall
that
was
practically
the
last
word
she
said
to
howard
for
her
aunt
joined
them
and
after
that
the
conversation
was
formal
it
was
not
very
long
before
the
carriage
came
for
him
and
helen
pressed
his
hand
gratefully
at
parting
and
stood
leaning
against
a
pillar
of
the
porch
shading
her
eyes
from
the
sun
while
she
watched
the
carriage
depart
then
she
sat
down
to
wait
for
it
to
return
from
the
depot
for
her
which
it
did
before
long
and
so
she
bid
farewell
to
her
aunt
it
was
a
great
relief
to
helen
and
while
we
know
not
what
emotions
it
may
cause
to
the
reader
it
is
perhaps
well
to
say
that
he
may
likewise
pay
his
last
respects
to
the
worthy
matron
who
will
not
take
part
in
the
humble
events
of
which
the
rest
of
our
story
must
be
composed
for
helen
was
going
home
home
to
the
poor
little
parsonage
of
oakdale
she
was
going
with
a
feeling
of
relief
in
her
heart
second
only
to
her
sorow
the
more
she
had
come
to
feel
how
shallow
and
false
was
the
splendor
that
had
allured
her
the
more
she
had
found
herself
drawn
to
her
old
home
with
its
memories
that
were
so
dear
and
so
beautiful
she
felt
that
there
she
might
at
least
think
of
arthur
all
that
she
chose
and
meet
with
nothing
to
affront
her
grief
and
also
she
found
herself
thinking
of
her
father
love
with
a
new
kind
of
hunger
when
she
arrived
she
found
davis
waiting
for
her
with
a
very
anxious
look
upon
his
countenance
he
had
stopped
at
hilltown
on
his
way
and
learned
about
arthur
disappearance
and
then
heard
from
elizabeth
what
she
knew
about
helen
engagement
the
girl
flung
herself
into
his
arms
and
afterwards
quite
overcome
by
the
emotions
that
surged
up
within
her
sank
down
upon
her
knees
before
him
and
sobbed
out
the
whole
story
her
heart
bursting
with
sorrow
and
contrition
as
he
lifted
her
up
and
kissed
her
and
whispered
his
beautiful
words
of
pardon
and
comfort
helen
found
it
a
real
homecoming
indeed
davis
was
also
able
to
calm
her
worry
a
little
by
telling
her
that
he
did
not
think
it
possible
that
arthur
would
keep
his
whereabouts
secret
from
him
very
long
i
find
him
dear
child
he
said
will
all
be
well
again
for
we
will
believe
in
love
you
and
i
and
not
care
what
the
great
world
says
about
it
i
think
i
could
be
well
content
that
you
should
marry
our
dear
father
i
do
not
love
him
put
in
helen
faintly
may
come
in
time
said
the
other
kissing
her
tenderly
and
smiling
is
no
need
to
talk
of
it
for
you
are
too
young
to
marry
anyway
and
in
the
meantime
we
must
find
there
was
a
long
silence
after
that
helen
sat
down
on
the
sofa
beside
her
father
and
put
her
arms
about
him
and
leaned
her
head
upon
his
bosom
drinking
in
deep
drafts
of
his
pardon
and
love
she
told
him
about
howard
and
of
the
words
of
counsel
which
he
had
given
her
and
how
he
was
coming
to
see
her
again
afterwards
the
conversation
came
back
to
arthur
and
his
love
for
helen
and
then
davis
went
on
to
add
something
that
caused
helen
to
open
her
eyes
very
wide
and
gaze
at
him
in
wonder
is
still
another
reason
for
wishing
to
find
him
soon
he
said
something
else
has
happened
that
he
ought
to
know
is
it
asked
helen
do
know
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
about
it
just
now
said
the
other
it
is
a
very
sad
story
but
someone
was
here
to
see
arthur
this
morning
someone
whom
i
never
expected
to
see
again
in
all
my
see
arthur
echoed
the
girl
in
perplexity
could
want
to
see
arthur
as
her
father
went
on
she
gave
a
great
start
was
his
mother
said
davis
and
helen
stared
at
him
gasping
for
breath
as
she
echoed
the
words
mother
may
well
be
astonished
said
the
clergyman
the
woman
proved
beyond
doubt
that
she
was
really
the
person
who
left
arthur
with
did
not
recognize
her
helen
for
it
has
been
or
two
years
since
i
saw
her
and
she
has
changed
very
much
since
then
but
she
told
me
that
in
all
that
time
she
has
never
once
lost
sight
of
her
boy
and
has
been
watching
all
that
he
has
she
been
did
not
tell
me
the
other
answered
i
fancy
in
new
york
the
poor
woman
has
lived
a
very
dreadful
life
a
life
of
such
wretched
wickedness
that
we
can
not
even
talk
about
it
i
think
i
never
heard
of
more
cruel
suffering
i
was
glad
that
you
were
not
here
to
see
her
or
know
about
it
until
after
she
was
gone
she
said
that
she
had
come
to
see
arthur
once
because
she
was
going
away
to
die
exclaimed
the
girl
in
horror
said
davis
die
she
looked
as
if
she
could
not
live
many
days
longer
i
begged
her
to
let
me
see
that
she
was
provided
for
but
she
said
that
she
was
going
to
find
her
way
back
to
her
old
home
somewhere
far
off
in
the
country
and
she
would
hear
of
nothing
else
she
would
not
tell
the
name
of
the
place
nor
her
own
name
but
she
left
a
letter
for
arthur
and
begged
me
to
find
him
and
give
it
to
him
so
that
he
might
come
and
speak
to
her
once
if
he
cared
to
do
so
she
begged
me
to
forgive
her
for
the
trouble
she
had
caused
me
and
to
pray
that
god
would
forgive
her
too
and
then
she
bade
me
farewell
and
dragged
herself
davis
stopped
and
helen
sat
for
a
long
time
staring
ahead
of
her
with
a
very
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
and
thinking
we
must
find
arthur
then
she
turned
to
her
father
her
lips
trembling
and
her
countenance
very
pale
me
she
said
in
a
low
voice
long
time
ago
someone
must
have
wronged
that
dear
said
davis
she
was
not
even
as
old
as
you
are
and
the
man
who
wronged
her
was
worth
millions
of
dollars
helen
and
could
have
saved
her
from
all
her
suffering
with
a
few
of
them
if
he
cared
to
no
one
but
god
knows
his
name
for
the
woman
would
not
tell
helen
sat
for
a
moment
or
two
staring
at
him
wildly
and
then
suddenly
she
buried
her
head
in
his
bosom
and
burst
into
tears
sobbing
so
cruelly
that
her
father
was
sorry
he
had
told
her
what
he
had
he
knew
why
that
story
moved
her
so
and
it
wrung
his
heart
to
think
of
it
that
this
child
of
his
had
put
upon
her
own
shoulders
some
of
that
burden
of
the
guilt
of
things
and
must
suffer
beneath
it
perhaps
for
the
rest
of
her
days
when
helen
gazed
up
at
him
again
there
was
the
old
frightened
look
upon
her
face
and
all
his
attempts
to
comfort
her
were
useless
no
she
whispered
father
i
can
not
even
think
of
peace
again
until
we
have
found
arthur
freundliches
voglein
chapter
xii
fugitive
and
gracious
light
he
seeks
shy
to
illumine
and
i
seek
it
too
this
does
not
come
with
houses
or
with
gold
with
place
with
honor
and
a
flattering
crew
is
not
in
the
world
market
bought
and
three
days
passed
by
after
helen
had
returned
to
her
father
during
which
the
girl
stayed
by
herself
most
of
the
time
when
the
breaking
off
of
her
engagement
was
known
many
of
her
old
friends
came
to
see
her
but
the
hints
that
they
dropped
did
not
move
her
to
any
confidences
she
felt
that
it
would
not
be
possible
for
her
to
find
among
them
any
understanding
of
her
present
moods
her
old
life
or
rather
the
life
to
which
she
had
been
looking
forward
seemed
to
her
quite
empty
and
shallow
and
there
was
nothing
useful
that
she
knew
of
to
do
except
to
offer
to
help
her
father
in
such
ways
as
she
could
she
drew
back
into
her
own
heart
giving
most
of
her
time
to
thinking
about
howard
and
arthur
and
no
one
but
her
father
knew
why
it
was
that
she
was
so
subdued
and
silent
it
was
only
on
the
third
morning
when
there
came
a
letter
from
howard
saying
that
he
was
coming
out
that
afternoon
to
see
her
that
helen
seemed
to
be
interested
and
stirred
again
she
went
to
the
window
more
than
once
to
look
for
him
and
when
at
last
her
friend
had
arrived
and
the
two
were
seated
in
the
parlor
she
said
to
him
without
waiting
for
any
circumstance
have
been
wishing
very
much
to
see
you
howard
because
there
is
something
i
am
anxious
to
talk
to
you
about
if
you
will
let
am
sorry
to
say
that
it
is
about
myself
she
went
on
when
the
other
had
expressed
his
willingness
to
hear
her
i
want
to
ask
you
to
help
me
and
to
give
me
some
advice
i
ought
to
have
asked
you
the
questions
i
am
going
to
before
this
but
the
last
time
i
saw
you
i
could
think
about
nothing
but
arthur
they
only
came
to
me
after
you
had
are
they
asked
the
man
must
knew
howard
said
helen
it
is
you
who
have
shown
me
the
wrongness
of
all
that
i
was
doing
in
my
life
and
stirred
me
with
a
desire
to
do
better
i
find
now
that
such
thoughts
have
always
been
so
far
from
me
that
the
wish
to
be
right
is
all
that
i
have
and
i
do
not
know
at
all
what
to
do
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
would
rather
talk
to
you
about
it
than
to
anyone
even
my
own
father
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
just
right
but
you
do
not
mind
my
asking
you
do
you
is
my
wish
to
help
you
in
every
way
that
i
can
was
the
gentle
response
will
tell
you
what
i
have
been
thinking
said
helen
have
been
so
unhappy
in
the
last
three
days
that
i
have
done
nothing
at
all
but
it
seemed
to
me
somehow
that
it
must
be
wrong
of
me
to
let
go
of
myself
in
that
way
as
if
i
had
no
right
to
pamper
myself
and
indulge
my
own
feelings
it
was
not
that
i
wished
to
forget
what
wrong
things
i
have
done
or
keep
from
suffering
because
of
them
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
fact
that
i
was
wretched
and
frightened
was
no
excuse
for
my
doing
no
good
for
the
rest
of
my
life
when
i
have
thought
about
my
duty
before
it
has
always
been
my
task
of
studying
and
practicing
music
but
that
is
not
at
all
what
i
want
now
for
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
such
things
while
the
memory
of
arthur
is
in
my
mind
i
need
something
that
is
not
for
myself
howard
and
i
find
myself
thinking
that
it
should
be
something
that
i
do
not
like
to
helen
paused
for
a
moment
gazing
at
the
other
anxiously
and
then
she
went
on
must
know
that
what
is
really
behind
what
i
am
saying
is
what
you
said
that
evening
in
the
arbor
about
the
kind
of
woman
i
ought
to
be
because
god
has
made
me
beautiful
my
heart
is
full
of
a
great
hunger
to
be
set
right
and
to
get
a
clearer
sight
of
the
things
that
are
truly
good
in
life
i
want
you
to
talk
to
me
about
your
own
ideals
and
what
you
do
to
keep
your
life
deep
and
true
and
then
to
tell
me
what
you
would
do
in
my
place
i
promise
you
that
no
matter
how
hard
it
may
be
i
shall
feel
that
just
what
you
tell
me
to
do
is
my
duty
and
at
least
i
shall
never
be
happy
again
until
i
have
done
it
do
you
understand
how
i
feel
howard
the
man
answered
in
a
quiet
voice
understand
you
and
then
as
he
paused
watching
the
girl
from
beneath
his
dark
brows
helen
asked
do
not
mind
talking
to
me
about
yourself
a
man
lives
all
alone
and
as
as
i
the
other
replied
smiling
is
fatally
easy
for
him
to
do
that
he
may
blend
himself
with
his
ideals
in
such
a
curious
way
that
he
never
talks
about
anything
else
but
if
you
will
excuse
that
i
will
tell
you
what
i
me
why
it
is
that
you
live
so
much
alone
said
the
girl
it
that
you
do
not
care
for
friends
is
very
difficult
for
a
man
who
feels
about
life
as
i
do
to
find
many
friends
he
responded
one
strives
to
dwell
in
deep
things
and
is
very
keen
and
earnest
about
it
he
is
apt
to
find
very
little
to
help
him
outside
of
himself
perhaps
it
is
because
i
have
met
very
few
persons
in
my
life
but
it
has
not
happened
to
me
to
find
anyone
who
thinks
about
it
as
i
do
or
who
cares
to
live
it
with
my
strenuousness
i
have
met
musicians
some
who
labored
very
hard
at
their
art
but
none
who
felt
it
a
duty
to
labor
with
their
own
souls
to
make
them
beautiful
and
strong
and
i
have
met
literary
men
and
scholars
but
they
were
all
interested
in
books
and
were
willing
to
be
learned
and
to
classify
and
plod
i
have
never
found
one
who
was
swift
and
eager
and
full
of
high
impatience
for
what
is
real
and
the
best
there
should
come
times
to
a
man
i
think
when
he
feels
that
books
are
an
impertinence
when
he
knows
that
he
has
only
the
battle
with
his
own
heart
to
fight
and
the
prize
of
its
joy
to
win
when
such
moods
come
upon
him
he
sees
that
he
has
to
live
his
life
upon
his
knees
and
it
is
rarely
indeed
that
he
knows
of
anyone
who
can
follow
him
and
share
in
his
labor
so
it
is
that
i
have
had
to
live
all
my
life
by
myself
miss
have
always
done
that
helen
asked
as
he
stopped
he
answered
for
very
many
years
i
have
a
little
house
on
the
wildest
of
lakes
up
in
the
mountains
wyhere
i
play
the
hermit
in
the
summer
and
where
i
should
have
been
now
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
yielded
to
your
aunt
invitation
when
i
spoke
of
having
no
friends
i
forgot
the
things
of
nature
which
really
do
sympathize
with
an
artist
life
i
find
that
they
never
fail
to
become
full
of
meaning
whenever
my
own
spirit
shakes
off
its
bonds
it
has
always
been
a
belief
of
mine
that
there
is
nothing
that
nature
makes
that
is
quite
so
dull
and
unfeeling
as
man
with
the
exception
of
children
and
lovers
i
had
much
rather
play
my
violin
for
the
flowers
and
the
like
to
play
it
out
of
doors
helen
asked
with
a
sudden
smile
laughed
the
other
is
one
of
my
privileges
as
a
hermit
it
seems
quite
natural
to
the
wild
things
for
they
have
all
a
music
of
their
own
a
wonderful
silent
music
that
the
best
musicians
can
not
catch
do
you
not
believe
that
miss
davis
helen
said
and
sat
gazing
at
her
companion
silently
for
a
minute
should
think
a
life
of
such
effort
would
be
very
hard
she
said
finally
you
not
ever
fail
do
not
do
much
else
he
replied
with
a
sad
smile
get
up
and
stumble
on
the
mastership
of
one
heart
is
the
ideal
you
know
and
after
all
one
own
life
can
not
be
anything
but
struggle
and
failure
for
the
power
he
is
trying
to
conquer
is
infinite
when
i
find
my
life
very
hard
i
do
not
complain
but
know
that
the
reason
for
it
is
that
i
have
chosen
to
have
it
real
and
that
the
essence
of
the
soul
is
its
effort
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
thing
to
feel
about
life
miss
is
why
i
do
not
wish
to
be
idle
said
helen
is
just
because
people
do
not
know
this
fact
about
the
soul
the
other
continued
are
not
willing
to
dare
and
suffer
and
overcome
dullness
and
keep
their
spiritual
faculties
free
that
they
sink
down
as
they
grow
older
and
become
what
they
call
practical
and
talk
very
wisely
about
experience
it
is
only
when
god
sends
into
the
world
a
man
of
genius
that
no
mountains
of
earth
can
crush
and
who
keeps
his
faith
and
sweetness
all
through
his
life
that
we
learn
the
baseness
of
the
thought
that
experience
necessarily
brings
cynicism
and
selfishness
there
is
to
me
in
all
this
world
nothing
more
hateful
than
this
disillusioned
worldliness
and
nothing
makes
me
angrier
than
to
see
it
taking
the
name
of
wisdom
if
i
were
a
man
with
an
art
there
is
nothing
i
think
that
i
should
feel
more
called
to
make
war
upon
it
is
a
very
blow
in
the
face
of
god
nothing
makes
me
sadder
than
to
see
the
life
that
such
people
live
to
see
for
instance
how
pathetic
are
the
things
they
call
their
entertainments
and
when
one
knows
himself
that
life
is
a
magic
potion
to
be
drank
with
rapture
and
awe
that
every
instance
of
it
ought
to
be
a
hymn
of
rejoicing
and
the
whole
of
it
rich
and
full
of
power
like
some
majestic
symphony
i
often
find
myself
wishing
that
there
were
some
way
of
saving
the
time
that
people
spend
in
their
pleasures
piled
on
life
were
all
too
little
and
of
one
to
me
little
remains
as
i
kneel
before
god
altar
of
the
heart
i
know
that
if
i
had
infinite
time
and
infinite
energy
there
would
be
beauty
and
joy
still
to
seek
and
so
as
i
look
about
me
in
the
world
and
see
all
the
sin
and
misery
that
is
in
it
it
is
my
comfort
to
know
that
the
reason
for
it
is
that
men
are
still
living
the
lives
of
the
animals
and
have
not
even
dreamed
of
the
life
that
belongs
to
them
as
men
that
is
something
about
which
i
feel
very
strongly
myself
that
is
part
of
my
duty
as
a
man
who
seeks
worship
and
rightness
to
mark
that
difference
in
my
own
life
quite
howard
paused
for
a
moment
and
helen
said
very
earnestly
wish
that
you
would
tell
me
about
consider
it
my
duty
the
other
replied
keep
all
the
external
circumstances
of
my
life
as
simple
and
as
humble
as
i
should
have
to
if
i
were
quite
poor
if
i
were
not
physically
unable
i
should
feel
that
i
ought
to
do
for
my
own
self
all
that
i
needed
to
have
done
for
i
think
that
if
it
is
necessary
that
others
should
be
degraded
to
menial
service
in
order
that
my
soul
might
be
beautiful
and
true
then
life
is
bad
at
the
heart
of
it
and
i
want
none
of
its
truth
and
beauty
i
do
not
have
to
look
into
my
heart
very
long
miss
davis
to
discover
that
what
i
am
seeking
in
life
is
something
that
no
millions
of
money
can
buy
me
and
when
i
am
face
to
face
with
the
sternness
of
what
i
call
that
spiritual
fact
i
see
that
fine
houses
and
all
the
rest
are
a
foolish
kind
of
toy
and
wonder
that
any
man
should
think
that
he
can
please
me
by
giving
the
labor
of
his
soul
to
making
them
it
is
much
the
same
thing
as
i
feel
for
instance
when
i
go
to
hear
a
master
of
music
and
find
that
he
has
spent
his
hours
in
torturing
himself
and
his
fingers
in
order
to
give
me
an
acrobatic
exhibition
when
all
the
time
what
i
wish
him
to
do
and
what
his
genius
gave
him
power
to
do
was
to
find
the
magic
word
that
should
set
free
the
slumbering
demon
of
my
soul
so
i
think
that
a
man
who
wishes
to
grow
by
sympathy
and
worship
should
do
without
wealth
if
only
because
it
is
so
trivial
but
of
course
i
have
left
unmentioned
what
is
the
great
reason
for
a
life
the
reason
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
matter
and
that
includes
all
the
others
in
it
that
he
who
lives
by
prayer
and
joy
makes
all
men
richer
but
he
who
takes
more
than
his
bare
necessity
of
the
wealth
of
the
body
must
know
that
he
robs
his
brother
when
he
does
it
the
things
of
the
soul
are
everywhere
but
wealth
stands
for
the
toil
and
suffering
of
human
beings
and
thousands
must
starve
and
die
so
that
one
rich
man
may
live
at
ease
that
is
no
fine
rhetoric
that
i
am
indulging
in
but
a
very
deep
and
earnest
conviction
of
my
soul
first
of
all
facts
of
morality
stands
the
law
that
the
life
of
man
is
labor
and
that
he
who
chooses
to
live
otherwise
is
a
dastard
he
may
chase
the
phantom
of
happiness
all
his
days
and
not
find
it
and
yet
never
guess
the
reason
that
joy
is
a
melody
of
the
heart
and
that
he
is
playing
upon
an
instrument
that
is
out
of
tune
few
people
choose
to
think
of
that
at
all
but
i
can
not
afford
ever
to
forget
it
for
my
task
is
to
live
the
artist
life
to
dwell
close
to
the
heart
of
things
it
is
something
that
i
simply
can
not
understand
how
any
man
who
pretends
to
do
that
can
know
of
the
suffering
and
starving
that
is
in
the
world
and
can
feel
that
he
who
has
god
temple
of
the
soul
for
his
dwelling
has
right
to
more
of
the
pleasures
of
earth
than
the
plainest
food
and
shelter
and
what
tools
of
his
art
he
requires
if
it
is
otherwise
it
can
only
be
because
he
is
no
artist
at
all
no
lover
of
life
but
only
a
tradesman
under
another
name
using
high
gift
to
get
for
himself
what
he
can
and
thinking
of
his
sympathy
and
feeling
as
things
that
he
puts
on
when
he
goes
to
work
and
when
he
is
sure
that
they
will
cost
him
no
howard
had
been
speaking
very
slowly
and
in
a
deep
and
earnest
voice
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
added
with
a
slight
smile
have
been
answering
your
question
without
thinking
about
it
miss
davis
for
i
have
told
you
all
that
there
is
to
tell
about
my
helen
did
not
answer
but
sat
for
a
long
time
gazing
at
him
and
thinking
very
deeply
then
she
said
to
him
her
voice
shaking
slightly
have
answered
only
half
of
my
question
howard
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
a
woman
can
do
to
bring
those
high
things
into
her
life
to
keep
her
soul
humble
and
strong
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
your
courage
and
the
man
voice
dropped
lower
as
he
answered
her
that
you
were
to
find
this
friend
of
yours
that
knows
you
so
well
and
loves
you
so
truly
do
you
not
think
that
there
might
be
a
chance
for
you
to
win
this
prize
of
life
that
i
speak
of
helen
did
not
reply
but
sat
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
other
countenance
as
he
went
on
his
deep
musical
voice
held
them
there
by
a
spell
davis
he
said
man
does
not
live
very
long
in
the
kingdom
of
the
soul
before
there
comes
to
be
one
thing
that
he
loves
more
than
anything
else
that
life
can
offer
that
thing
is
love
for
love
is
the
great
gateway
into
the
spiritual
life
the
stage
of
journey
when
human
beings
are
unselfish
and
true
to
their
hearts
if
ever
the
power
of
unselfishness
and
truth
lies
in
them
as
for
man
he
has
many
battles
to
fight
and
much
of
himself
to
kill
before
the
great
prizes
of
the
soul
can
be
his
but
the
true
woman
has
but
one
glory
and
one
duty
in
life
and
sacredness
and
beauty
are
hers
by
the
free
gift
of
god
if
she
be
a
true
woman
when
her
one
great
passion
takes
its
hold
upon
her
it
carries
all
her
being
with
it
and
she
gives
herself
and
all
that
she
has
because
i
believe
in
unselfishness
and
know
that
love
is
the
essence
of
things
i
find
in
all
the
world
nothing
more
beautiful
than
that
and
think
that
she
has
no
other
task
in
life
except
to
see
that
the
self
which
she
gives
is
her
best
and
inghest
and
to
hold
to
the
thought
of
the
sacredness
of
what
she
is
doing
for
love
is
the
soul
great
act
of
worship
and
the
heart
great
awakening
to
life
if
the
man
be
selfish
and
a
seeker
of
pleasure
what
i
say
of
love
and
woman
is
not
for
him
but
if
he
be
one
who
seeks
to
worship
to
rouse
the
soul
within
him
to
its
vision
of
the
beauty
and
preciousness
of
life
then
he
must
know
that
this
is
the
great
chance
that
nature
gives
him
that
no
effort
of
his
own
will
ever
carry
him
so
far
towards
what
he
seeks
the
woman
who
gives
herself
to
him
he
takes
for
his
own
with
awe
and
trembling
knowing
that
the
glory
which
he
reads
in
her
eyes
is
the
very
presence
of
the
spirit
of
life
and
because
she
stands
for
this
precious
thing
to
him
he
seeks
her
love
more
than
anything
else
upon
earth
feeling
that
if
he
has
it
he
has
everything
and
if
he
has
it
not
he
has
nothing
he
cherishes
the
woman
as
before
he
cherished
what
was
best
in
his
own
soul
he
chooses
all
fair
and
noble
actions
that
may
bring
him
still
more
of
her
love
all
else
that
life
has
for
him
he
lays
as
an
offering
at
the
shrine
of
her
heart
all
his
joy
and
all
his
care
and
asks
but
love
in
return
and
because
the
giving
of
love
is
the
woman
joy
and
the
perfectness
of
her
sacrifice
her
glory
they
come
to
forget
themselves
in
each
other
being
and
to
live
their
lives
in
each
other
hearts
the
joy
that
each
cares
for
is
no
longer
his
own
joy
but
the
other
and
so
they
come
to
stand
for
the
sacredness
of
god
to
each
other
and
for
perpetual
inspiration
by
and
by
perhaps
from
long
dwelling
out
of
themselves
and
feeding
their
hearts
upon
things
spiritual
they
learn
the
deep
and
mystic
religion
of
love
that
is
the
last
lesson
life
has
to
teach
it
is
given
to
no
man
to
know
what
is
the
source
of
this
mysterious
being
of
ours
but
men
who
come
near
to
it
find
it
so
glorious
that
they
die
for
it
in
joy
and
the
least
glimpse
of
it
gives
a
man
quite
a
new
feeling
about
a
human
heart
so
at
last
it
happens
that
the
lovers
read
a
fearful
wonder
in
each
other
eyes
and
give
each
other
royal
greeting
no
longer
for
what
they
are
but
for
that
which
they
would
like
to
be
they
come
to
worship
together
as
they
could
never
have
worshiped
apart
and
always
that
which
they
worship
and
that
in
which
they
dwell
is
what
all
existence
is
seeking
with
so
much
pain
the
sacred
presence
of
wonder
that
some
call
truth
and
some
beauty
but
all
love
when
you
ask
me
how
unselfishness
is
to
be
made
yours
in
life
that
is
the
answer
which
i
give
howard
voice
had
dropped
very
low
as
he
stopped
helen
was
trembling
within
herself
she
was
drinking
still
more
from
the
bottomless
cup
of
her
humiliation
and
remorse
for
she
was
still
haunted
by
the
specter
of
what
she
had
done
the
man
went
on
after
an
interval
of
silence
think
there
is
no
one
he
said
these
things
touch
more
than
the
man
who
would
live
the
life
of
art
that
i
have
talked
of
before
for
the
artist
seeks
experience
above
all
things
seeks
it
not
only
for
himself
but
for
his
race
and
it
must
come
from
his
own
heart
no
one
can
drive
him
to
his
task
all
artists
tell
that
the
great
source
of
their
power
is
love
and
the
wisest
of
them
makes
of
his
love
an
as
he
makes
an
of
his
life
he
counts
his
power
of
loving
most
sacred
of
all
his
powers
and
guards
it
from
harm
as
he
guards
his
life
itself
he
gives
all
his
soul
to
the
dreaming
of
that
dream
and
lays
all
his
prayer
before
it
and
when
he
meets
with
the
maiden
who
will
honor
such
effort
he
forgets
everything
else
in
his
life
and
gives
her
all
his
heart
and
studies
to
her
by
years
of
noble
deeds
for
a
woman
who
loves
love
the
heart
of
such
a
man
is
a
lifetime
treasure
for
his
passion
is
of
the
soul
and
does
not
die
and
all
that
he
has
done
has
been
really
but
a
training
of
himself
for
that
great
consecration
if
he
be
a
true
artist
all
his
days
have
been
spent
in
learning
to
wrestle
with
himself
to
rouse
himself
and
master
his
own
heart
until
at
last
his
very
being
has
become
a
prayer
and
his
soul
like
a
great
storm
of
wind
that
sweeps
everything
away
in
its
arms
perhaps
that
hunger
has
possessed
him
so
that
he
never
even
wakens
in
the
dead
of
night
without
finding
it
with
him
in
all
its
strength
it
rouses
him
in
the
morning
with
a
song
and
when
midnight
comes
and
he
is
weary
it
is
a
benediction
and
a
hand
upon
his
brow
all
the
time
because
he
has
a
man
heart
and
knows
of
his
life
great
glory
his
longing
turns
to
a
dream
of
love
to
a
vision
of
the
flying
perfect
for
which
all
his
life
is
a
search
there
is
a
maiden
who
dwells
in
all
the
music
that
he
hears
and
who
calls
to
him
in
the
sunrise
and
flings
wide
the
flowers
upon
the
meadows
she
treads
before
him
on
the
moonlit
waters
and
strews
them
with
showers
of
fire
if
his
soul
be
only
strong
enough
perhaps
he
waits
long
years
for
that
perfect
woman
that
woman
who
loves
not
herself
but
loves
love
and
all
the
time
the
yearning
of
his
heart
is
growing
so
that
those
who
gaze
at
him
wonder
why
his
eyes
are
dark
and
sunken
he
knows
that
his
heart
is
a
which
he
himself
can
not
explore
and
that
in
all
the
world
he
seeks
nothing
but
some
woman
before
whom
he
might
fling
wide
its
helen
had
been
leaning
on
the
table
holding
her
hands
in
front
of
her
towards
the
end
they
were
trembling
so
much
that
she
took
them
away
and
clasped
them
in
her
lap
when
he
ceased
her
eyes
were
lowered
she
could
not
see
how
his
were
fixed
upon
her
but
she
knew
that
her
bosom
was
heaving
painfully
and
that
there
were
hot
tears
upon
her
cheeks
he
added
slowly
have
told
you
all
that
i
think
about
life
my
dear
friend
and
all
that
i
think
about
love
so
i
think
i
have
told
you
all
that
i
and
helen
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
and
gazed
at
him
through
her
tears
tell
of
such
things
she
asked
give
such
advice
to
said
the
other
gently
not
to
you
howard
helen
answered
you
not
know
what
i
have
done
and
how
i
must
feel
while
i
listen
to
you
it
is
good
that
i
should
hear
such
things
because
i
ought
to
suffer
but
when
i
asked
you
for
your
advice
i
wished
for
something
hard
and
stern
to
do
before
i
dared
ever
think
of
love
or
feel
myself
right
howard
sat
watching
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
he
answered
gently
do
not
think
my
dear
friend
that
it
is
our
duty
as
struggling
mortals
to
feel
ourselves
right
at
all
i
am
not
even
sure
that
we
ought
to
care
about
our
rightness
in
the
least
for
god
has
put
high
and
beautiful
things
in
the
world
things
that
call
for
all
our
attention
and
i
am
sure
that
we
are
never
so
close
to
rightness
as
when
we
give
all
our
devotion
to
them
and
cease
quite
utterly
to
think
about
ourselves
and
besides
that
the
love
that
i
speak
of
is
not
easy
to
give
miss
davis
it
is
easy
to
give
up
one
self
in
the
first
glow
of
feeling
but
to
forget
one
self
entirely
and
one
comfort
and
happiness
in
all
the
little
things
of
life
to
consecrate
one
self
and
all
that
one
has
to
a
lifetime
of
patience
and
and
to
seek
no
reward
and
ask
for
no
happiness
but
love
do
you
not
think
that
such
things
would
cost
one
pain
and
bring
a
good
conscience
at
last
helen
voice
was
very
low
as
she
answered
at
then
she
sat
very
still
and
finally
raised
her
deep
earnest
eyes
and
leaned
forward
and
gazed
straight
into
her
companion
howard
she
said
must
know
that
you
are
my
conscience
and
it
is
the
memory
of
your
words
that
causes
me
all
my
suffering
and
now
tell
me
one
thing
suppose
i
were
to
say
to
you
that
i
could
beg
upon
my
knees
for
a
chance
to
earn
such
a
life
as
that
and
suppose
i
should
ever
come
really
to
love
someone
and
should
give
up
everything
to
win
such
a
treasure
do
you
think
that
i
could
clear
my
soul
from
what
i
have
done
and
win
rightness
for
mine
do
you
think
that
you
that
you
could
ever
forget
that
i
was
the
woman
who
had
wished
to
sell
her
love
for
money
howard
answered
softly
i
think
are
you
sure
of
it
helen
asked
and
when
she
had
received
the
same
reply
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
a
wonderful
expression
of
relief
came
upon
her
face
all
her
being
seemed
to
rise
as
if
all
in
an
instant
she
had
flung
away
the
burden
of
shame
and
fear
that
had
been
crushing
her
soul
she
sat
gazing
at
the
other
with
a
strange
look
in
her
eyes
and
then
she
sank
down
and
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
upon
the
table
and
fully
a
minute
passed
thus
without
a
sound
helen
was
just
lifting
her
head
again
and
howard
was
about
to
speak
when
an
unexpected
interruption
caused
him
to
stop
the
front
door
was
opened
and
as
helen
turned
with
a
start
the
servant
came
and
stood
in
the
doorway
is
it
elizabeth
helen
asked
in
a
faint
voice
have
just
been
to
the
post
office
the
woman
answered
is
a
letter
for
well
helen
answered
it
to
and
she
took
it
and
put
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
then
she
waited
until
the
servant
was
gone
and
in
the
meantime
half
mechanically
turned
her
eyes
upon
the
envelope
suddenly
the
man
saw
her
give
a
violent
start
and
turn
very
pale
she
snatched
up
the
letter
and
sprang
to
her
feet
and
stood
supporting
herself
by
the
chair
her
hand
shaking
and
her
breath
coming
in
gasps
is
it
howard
cried
helen
voice
was
hoarse
and
choking
as
she
answered
him
is
from
arthur
as
he
started
and
half
rose
from
his
chair
the
girl
tore
open
the
letter
and
unfolded
the
contents
glancing
at
it
once
very
swiftly
her
eyes
flying
from
line
to
line
the
next
instant
she
let
it
fall
to
the
floor
with
a
cry
and
clutched
with
her
hands
at
her
bosom
she
tried
to
speak
but
she
was
choking
with
her
emotion
only
her
companion
saw
that
her
face
was
transfigured
with
delight
and
then
suddenly
she
sank
down
upon
the
sofa
beside
her
her
form
shaken
with
hysterical
laughter
and
sobbing
howard
had
risen
from
his
chair
in
wonder
but
before
he
could
take
a
step
toward
her
he
heard
someone
in
the
hall
and
davis
rushed
into
the
room
helen
he
exclaimed
is
the
matter
and
sank
down
upon
his
knees
beside
her
the
girl
raised
her
head
and
then
flung
herself
into
his
arms
exclaining
incoherently
daddy
i
am
free
oh
oh
can
you
believe
it
i
am
free
long
after
her
first
ecstasy
had
passed
helen
still
lay
with
her
head
buried
in
her
father
bosom
trembling
and
weeping
and
repeating
half
as
if
in
a
dream
that
last
wonderful
word
meanwhile
davis
had
bent
down
and
picked
up
the
paper
to
glance
over
it
most
certainly
arthur
would
have
wondered
had
he
seen
the
effect
of
that
letter
upon
helen
for
he
wrote
to
her
with
bitter
scorn
and
told
her
that
he
had
torn
his
love
for
her
from
his
heart
and
made
himself
master
of
his
own
life
again
he
bid
her
go
on
in
the
course
she
had
chosen
for
a
day
or
two
had
been
enough
for
him
to
find
the
end
of
her
power
over
him
and
of
his
care
for
her
and
he
added
that
he
wrote
to
her
only
that
she
might
not
please
herself
with
the
thought
of
having
wrecked
him
and
that
he
was
going
far
away
to
begin
his
life
again
the
words
brought
many
emotions
to
davis
and
suggested
many
doubts
but
to
helen
they
brought
but
one
thought
she
still
clung
to
her
father
sobbing
like
a
child
and
muttering
the
one
word
when
at
last
the
fit
had
vented
itself
and
she
looked
up
again
she
seemed
to
howard
more
like
a
girl
than
she
ever
had
before
and
she
wiped
away
her
tears
laughingly
and
smoothed
back
her
hair
and
was
wonderfully
beautiful
in
her
emotion
she
introduced
howard
to
her
father
and
begged
him
to
excuse
her
for
her
lack
of
could
not
help
it
she
said
oh
i
am
so
happy
so
happy
and
she
leaned
her
head
upon
her
father
shoulder
again
and
gazed
up
into
his
face
dear
she
said
are
you
not
happy
too
dear
mr
davis
protested
course
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
arthur
is
himself
again
but
that
is
not
finding
him
and
i
fear
oh
please
do
helen
cried
the
frightened
look
coming
back
upon
her
face
in
a
flash
please
do
not
tell
me
that
no
no
do
let
me
be
happy
just
a
little
while
think
of
it
how
wretched
i
have
been
and
now
to
know
he
is
safe
oh
please
daddy
and
the
tears
had
welled
up
in
helen
eyes
again
she
turned
quickly
to
howard
her
voice
trembling
me
that
i
may
be
happy
she
exclaimed
know
all
about
it
howard
is
it
not
right
that
i
should
be
happy
just
a
little
as
her
friend
answered
her
gently
that
he
thought
it
was
she
sat
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
the
cloud
passed
over
she
brushed
away
her
tears
and
put
her
arms
about
her
father
again
can
not
help
it
she
went
on
quickly
must
be
happy
whether
i
want
to
or
not
you
must
not
mind
anything
i
do
for
oh
think
what
it
means
to
have
been
so
wretched
so
crushed
and
so
frightened
i
thought
that
all
my
life
was
to
be
like
that
that
i
could
never
sing
again
because
arthur
was
ruined
nobody
will
ever
know
how
i
felt
how
many
tears
i
shed
and
now
think
what
it
means
to
be
free
to
be
free
oh
free
and
to
be
able
to
be
good
once
more
i
should
go
mad
if
i
thought
about
it
helen
had
risen
as
she
spoke
and
she
spread
out
her
arms
and
flung
back
her
head
and
drank
in
a
deep
breath
of
joy
she
began
singing
half
to
herself
and
then
as
that
brought
a
sudden
idea
into
her
mind
she
ran
to
the
window
and
shut
it
quickly
will
sing
you
my
hymn
she
laughed
is
the
way
to
be
happy
and
she
went
to
the
piano
in
a
minute
more
she
had
begun
the
chorus
she
had
sung
to
arthur
thee
joy
from
heaven
descending
the
flood
of
emotion
that
was
pent
up
within
her
poured
itself
out
in
the
wild
torrent
of
music
and
helen
seemed
happy
enough
to
make
up
for
all
the
weeks
of
suffering
as
she
swept
herself
on
she
proved
what
she
had
said
that
she
would
go
mad
if
she
thought
much
about
her
release
and
howard
and
her
father
sat
gazing
at
her
in
wonder
when
she
stopped
she
was
quite
exhausted
and
quite
dazed
and
came
and
buried
her
head
in
her
father
arms
and
sat
waiting
until
the
heaving
of
her
bosom
had
subsided
and
she
was
calm
once
more
in
the
meantime
murmuring
faintly
to
herself
again
and
again
that
she
was
happy
and
that
she
was
free
when
she
looked
up
and
brushed
away
her
tangled
hair
again
perhaps
she
thought
that
her
conduct
was
not
very
conventional
for
she
begged
howard
pardon
once
more
promising
to
be
more
orderly
by
and
by
then
she
added
laughing
is
good
that
you
should
see
me
happy
though
because
i
have
always
troubled
you
with
my
egotisms
she
went
on
talking
merrily
until
suddenly
she
sprang
up
and
said
shall
have
to
sing
again
if
i
do
not
run
away
so
i
am
going
upstairs
to
make
myself
look
respectable
and
with
that
she
danced
out
of
the
room
waking
the
echoes
of
the
house
with
her
caroling
merrily
shall
i
live
now
under
the
blossom
that
hangs
on
the
bough
im
leid
von
chapter
xiii
one
whom
i
can
court
with
no
great
change
of
manner
still
holding
reason
fort
tho
waving
fancy
several
weeks
had
passed
since
helen
had
received
the
letter
from
arthur
the
girl
having
in
the
meantime
settled
quietly
down
at
oakdale
she
had
seen
few
of
her
friends
excepting
howard
who
had
come
out
often
from
the
city
she
was
expecting
a
visit
from
him
one
bright
afternoon
and
was
standing
by
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
porch
gazing
up
at
the
blue
sky
above
her
and
waiting
to
hear
the
whistle
of
the
train
when
she
saw
her
friend
from
the
distance
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
and
went
to
meet
him
laughing
am
going
to
take
you
out
to
see
my
stream
and
my
bobolink
you
have
not
seen
our
country
yet
you
the
girl
seemed
to
howard
more
beautiful
that
afternoon
than
he
had
ever
known
her
before
for
she
was
dressed
all
in
white
and
there
was
the
old
spring
in
her
step
and
the
old
joy
in
her
heart
when
they
had
passed
out
of
the
village
she
found
the
sky
so
very
blue
and
the
clouds
so
very
white
and
the
woods
and
meadows
so
very
green
that
she
was
radiantly
happy
and
feared
that
she
would
have
to
sing
and
she
laughed
away
from
men
and
towns
to
the
wild
wood
and
the
downs
and
then
interrupted
herself
to
say
must
not
care
howard
if
i
chatter
away
and
do
all
the
talking
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
have
paid
a
visit
to
my
friends
out
here
and
they
will
all
be
here
to
welcome
even
as
helen
spoke
she
looked
up
and
there
was
the
bobolink
flying
over
her
head
and
pouring
out
his
song
also
the
merry
breeze
was
dancing
over
the
meadows
and
everything
about
her
was
in
motion
you
know
she
told
her
companion
think
most
of
the
happiness
of
my
life
has
been
out
in
these
fields
i
do
know
what
made
me
so
fond
of
the
country
but
even
when
i
was
a
very
little
thing
whenever
i
learned
a
new
song
i
would
come
out
here
and
sing
it
those
were
times
when
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
be
happy
you
know
and
i
never
thought
about
anything
else
it
has
always
been
so
easy
for
me
to
be
happy
i
do
know
why
there
is
a
fountain
of
joy
in
my
heart
that
wells
up
whether
i
want
it
to
or
not
so
that
i
can
always
be
as
merry
as
i
choose
i
am
afraid
that
is
very
selfish
is
it
howard
i
am
trying
to
be
right
now
you
may
consider
you
are
being
merry
for
my
sake
at
present
said
the
man
with
a
laugh
is
not
always
so
easy
for
me
to
be
well
then
smiled
helen
only
wish
that
you
had
brought
your
violin
along
for
you
see
i
always
think
of
these
things
of
nature
with
music
when
i
was
little
they
were
all
creatures
that
danced
with
me
these
winds
that
are
so
lively
were
funny
little
and
you
could
see
all
the
flowers
shake
as
they
swept
over
them
whenever
i
heard
any
music
that
was
quick
and
bright
i
always
used
to
fancy
that
some
of
them
had
hold
of
my
hands
and
were
teaching
me
to
run
i
never
thought
about
asking
why
but
i
used
to
find
that
very
exciting
and
then
there
was
my
streamlet
he
just
ahead
here
past
the
bushes
and
i
used
to
like
him
best
of
all
for
he
was
a
very
beautiful
youth
with
a
crown
of
flowers
upon
his
head
there
was
a
wonderful
light
in
his
eyes
and
his
voice
was
very
strong
and
clear
and
his
step
very
swift
so
it
was
quite
wonderful
when
you
danced
with
him
for
he
was
the
lord
of
all
the
rest
and
everything
around
you
got
into
motion
then
there
was
never
any
stopping
for
you
know
the
streamlet
always
goes
faster
and
faster
and
gets
more
and
more
joyous
until
you
can
not
bear
it
any
more
and
have
to
give
up
we
shall
have
to
play
the
kreutzer
sonata
some
time
mr
howard
was
thinking
of
that
said
the
other
smiling
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
people
imagine
when
they
listen
to
music
went
on
helen
have
all
sorts
of
queer
fancies
for
myself
whenever
it
gets
too
exciting
there
is
always
one
last
resource
you
can
fly
away
to
the
top
of
the
nearest
mountain
i
do
know
just
why
that
is
but
perhaps
it
because
you
can
see
so
much
from
there
or
because
there
are
so
many
winds
anyway
there
is
a
dance
a
wonderfully
thrilling
thing
if
only
the
composer
knows
how
to
manage
it
there
is
someone
who
dances
with
me
i
never
saw
his
face
but
he
always
there
and
everything
around
you
is
flying
fast
and
there
comes
surge
after
surge
of
the
music
and
sweeps
you
on
perhaps
some
of
those
wild
runs
on
the
violins
that
are
just
as
if
the
wind
took
you
up
in
its
arms
and
whirled
you
away
in
the
air
that
is
a
most
tremendous
experience
when
it
happens
because
then
you
go
quite
beside
yourself
and
you
see
that
all
the
world
is
alive
and
full
of
power
the
great
things
of
the
forest
begin
to
stir
too
the
trees
and
the
strange
shapes
in
the
clouds
and
all
the
world
is
suddenly
gone
mad
with
motion
and
so
by
the
time
you
come
to
the
last
chords
your
hands
are
clenched
and
you
can
hardly
breathe
and
you
feel
that
all
your
soul
is
throbbing
helen
was
getting
quite
excited
then
just
over
her
own
enthusiasm
perhaps
it
was
because
the
wind
was
blowing
about
her
that
the
way
music
does
with
you
she
laughed
as
she
stopped
said
howard
smiling
in
turn
then
again
while
all
my
soul
is
throbbing
i
feel
my
neighbor
reaching
to
put
on
her
wraps
and
that
brings
me
down
from
the
mountains
so
quickly
that
it
is
painful
afterwards
you
go
outside
among
the
cabs
and
and
make
sad
discoveries
about
are
a
pessimist
said
the
girl
responded
the
other
try
to
keep
your
fountain
of
joy
a
while
miss
davis
there
are
disagreeable
things
in
life
to
be
done
and
some
suffering
to
be
borne
and
sometimes
the
fountain
dries
up
very
quickly
helen
was
much
more
ready
to
look
serious
than
she
would
have
been
a
month
before
she
asked
in
a
different
tone
think
that
must
always
happen
quite
always
was
the
reply
are
a
few
who
manage
to
keep
it
but
it
means
a
great
deal
of
effort
perhaps
you
never
took
your
own
happiness
so
seriously
he
added
with
a
smile
said
helen
never
made
much
effort
that
i
know
day
perhaps
you
will
have
to
replied
the
other
then
you
will
think
of
the
creatures
of
nature
as
i
do
not
simply
as
rejoicing
but
as
fighting
the
same
battle
and
daring
the
same
pain
as
the
girl
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
you
really
believe
that
as
a
fact
believe
something
was
the
answer
makes
me
think
when
i
go
among
men
and
see
their
dullness
that
nature
is
flinging
wide
her
glory
in
helpless
appeal
to
them
and
that
it
is
a
dreadful
accident
that
they
have
no
eyes
and
she
no
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
added
smiling
would
take
metaphysics
to
explain
that
and
meanwhile
we
were
talking
about
your
precious
fountain
of
should
think
answered
helen
thoughtfully
it
would
be
much
better
to
earn
one
after
you
had
tried
it
a
while
you
would
not
think
so
replied
her
companion
is
the
artist
life
you
know
and
in
practice
it
is
generally
a
very
dreadful
life
real
effort
is
very
hard
to
make
and
there
is
always
a
new
possibility
to
lure
the
artist
so
that
his
life
is
always
restless
and
a
cruel
is
such
a
life
that
you
have
lived
howard
asked
helen
gazing
at
him
are
compensations
he
replied
smiling
slightly
there
would
be
no
artists
there
comes
to
each
one
who
persists
some
hour
of
victory
some
hour
when
he
catches
the
tide
of
his
being
at
the
flood
and
when
he
finds
himself
master
of
all
that
his
soul
contains
and
takes
a
kind
of
fierce
delight
in
sweeping
himself
on
and
in
breaking
through
everything
that
stands
in
his
way
you
made
me
think
of
such
things
by
what
you
said
of
your
joy
in
music
only
perhaps
the
artist
discovers
that
not
only
the
streamlets
and
the
winds
have
motion
and
meaning
but
that
the
planets
also
have
a
word
for
his
soul
and
his
own
being
comes
suddenly
to
seem
to
him
a
power
which
it
frightens
him
to
know
of
and
he
sees
the
genius
of
life
as
a
spirit
with
eyes
of
flame
it
lifts
him
from
his
feet
and
drags
him
away
and
the
task
of
his
soul
takes
the
form
of
something
that
he
could
cry
out
to
escape
he
has
fought
his
way
into
the
depths
of
being
at
last
and
lie
stands
alone
in
all
his
littleness
on
the
shore
of
an
ocean
whose
waves
are
centuries
and
then
even
while
he
is
wondering
and
full
of
fear
his
power
begins
to
die
within
him
and
to
go
he
knows
not
how
and
when
he
looks
at
himself
again
he
is
like
a
man
who
has
had
a
dream
and
wakened
with
only
the
trembling
left
except
that
he
knows
it
was
no
dream
but
a
fiery
reality
and
that
the
memory
of
it
will
cast
a
shadow
over
all
the
rest
of
his
days
and
make
them
seem
trivial
and
meaningless
no
one
knows
how
many
years
he
may
spend
in
seeking
and
never
find
that
lost
glory
howard
had
been
speaking
very
intensely
and
when
he
stopped
helen
did
not
reply
at
once
but
continued
gazing
at
him
is
the
use
of
such
moments
she
asked
at
last
they
only
make
one
wretched
least
one
may
keep
the
memory
he
replied
with
a
smile
that
gives
him
a
standard
of
reality
he
learns
to
be
humble
and
learns
how
to
judge
men
and
men
glory
and
the
wonderful
things
of
men
world
so
that
while
they
are
the
most
and
creatures
living
he
may
see
them
as
dumb
cattle
that
are
grazing
while
the
sunrise
is
firing
the
have
had
such
moments
yourself
asked
helen
long
time
ago
said
the
other
smiling
at
the
seriousness
with
which
she
spoke
you
were
telling
me
about
your
musical
fancies
you
made
me
remember
how
once
when
i
was
young
i
climbed
a
high
hill
and
had
an
adventure
with
a
wind
that
was
very
swift
and
eager
at
first
i
recollect
i
tried
not
to
heed
it
because
i
had
been
dull
and
idle
and
unhappy
but
i
found
that
i
could
not
be
very
long
in
the
presence
of
so
much
life
without
being
made
ashamed
and
that
brave
windstorm
put
me
through
a
course
of
repentance
of
the
very
sternest
kind
before
it
let
me
go
i
tried
just
to
promise
that
i
would
be
more
and
more
true
but
it
paid
not
the
least
attention
to
that
and
it
would
hear
no
arguments
as
to
the
consequences
it
came
again
and
again
with
a
furious
burst
and
swept
me
away
every
time
i
tried
to
think
it
declared
that
i
had
been
putting
off
the
task
of
living
my
life
long
enough
and
that
i
was
to
attend
to
it
then
and
there
and
when
i
gave
myself
up
as
demanded
it
had
not
the
least
mercy
upon
me
and
each
time
that
i
protested
that
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
power
it
simply
whirled
me
away
again
like
a
mad
thing
when
at
last
i
came
down
from
the
hillside
i
had
quite
a
new
idea
of
what
living
meant
and
i
have
been
more
respectful
before
the
winds
and
other
people
of
genius
ever
helen
felt
very
much
at
home
in
that
merry
phantasy
of
her
companion
but
she
did
not
say
anything
after
a
moment
waiting
the
other
went
on
to
tell
her
of
something
else
that
pleased
her
no
less
remember
he
said
as
i
came
down
i
chanced
upon
a
very
wonderful
sight
one
which
made
an
impression
upon
me
that
i
have
not
forgotten
it
was
a
thicket
of
wild
roses
and
i
have
always
dreamed
that
the
wild
rose
was
a
creature
of
the
wind
and
fire
but
i
never
knew
so
much
about
it
before
after
that
day
i
have
come
seriously
to
believe
it
would
be
best
if
we
prudent
and
timid
creatures
who
neither
dare
nor
care
anything
for
the
sake
of
beauty
if
we
simply
did
not
ever
see
the
wild
rose
for
it
lives
only
for
a
day
or
two
miss
davis
and
yet
as
i
discovered
then
we
may
live
all
our
years
and
never
get
one
such
burst
of
glory
one
such
instant
of
exultation
and
faith
as
that
and
also
i
seriously
think
that
among
men
and
all
the
wonderful
works
of
men
there
is
nothing
so
beautiful
and
so
precious
as
that
little
flower
that
none
of
them
howard
glanced
at
the
girl
suddenly
she
had
half
stopped
in
her
walk
and
she
was
gazing
at
him
with
a
very
eager
look
in
her
bright
eyes
is
it
he
asked
her
and
helen
exclaimed
i
am
so
glad
you
mentioned
it
i
had
forgotten
actually
forgotten
as
her
friend
looked
puzzled
the
girl
went
on
with
her
merriest
laugh
must
tell
you
all
about
it
and
we
shall
be
happy
once
more
for
you
turn
down
this
path
towards
the
woods
and
then
you
must
go
very
quietly
and
hold
your
breath
and
prepare
yourself
just
as
if
you
were
going
into
a
great
cathedral
for
you
want
all
your
heart
to
be
full
of
expectation
and
joy
it
is
for
only
about
one
week
in
the
year
that
you
may
see
this
great
sight
and
the
excitement
of
the
first
rapture
is
best
of
all
it
would
be
so
dreadful
if
you
were
not
reverent
you
must
fancy
that
you
are
coming
to
hear
a
wonderful
musician
and
you
know
that
he
play
for
you
but
you
do
know
just
when
that
what
i
used
to
pretend
and
i
used
to
come
every
day
for
a
week
or
two
and
very
early
in
the
morning
when
the
dew
was
still
everywhere
and
the
winds
were
still
gay
several
times
you
go
back
home
disappointed
but
that
only
makes
you
more
eager
for
the
next
time
and
when
you
do
find
them
it
is
wonderful
oh
most
wonderful
for
there
is
a
whole
hedge
of
them
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
you
may
be
just
as
madly
happy
as
you
choose
and
never
be
half
happy
enough
because
they
are
so
beautiful
are
wild
roses
asked
the
other
smiling
said
helen
oh
think
how
many
days
i
have
forgotten
them
and
they
may
have
bloomed
and
for
three
years
i
have
not
been
here
and
i
was
thinking
about
it
all
the
way
over
on
the
they
had
come
to
the
path
that
turned
off
to
the
woods
and
helen
led
her
companion
down
it
still
prattling
away
in
the
meantime
when
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
she
began
walking
upon
tip
toe
and
put
her
fingers
upon
her
lips
in
fun
then
suddenly
she
gave
a
cry
of
delight
for
there
were
the
roses
for
a
fact
a
whole
hedge
of
them
as
she
had
said
glowing
in
the
bright
sun
and
making
a
wonderful
vision
the
two
stopped
and
stood
gazing
at
them
the
girl
whole
soul
dancing
within
her
do
you
know
she
cried
suddenly
think
that
i
could
get
drunk
with
just
looking
at
roses
there
is
a
strange
kind
of
excitement
that
comes
over
one
from
drinking
in
the
sight
of
their
rich
red
and
their
gracefulness
and
perfume
it
makes
all
my
blood
begin
to
flow
faster
and
i
quite
forget
everything
helen
stood
for
a
few
moments
longer
with
her
countenance
of
joy
afterwards
she
went
towards
the
flowers
and
knelt
down
in
front
of
them
choosing
a
bud
that
was
very
perfect
always
allow
myself
just
one
she
said
one
for
love
and
then
she
bent
over
it
whispering
softly
is
the
lullaby
time
is
singing
hush
and
heed
not
for
all
things
she
plucked
it
and
held
it
up
before
her
while
the
wind
came
up
behind
her
and
tossed
it
about
and
tossed
her
skirts
helen
radiant
with
laughter
glanced
at
her
companion
saying
gaily
must
hold
it
very
lightly
just
like
this
you
know
with
one
finger
and
a
thumb
and
then
you
may
toss
it
before
you
and
lose
yourself
in
its
perfectness
until
it
makes
all
your
soul
feel
gracious
do
you
know
howard
i
think
one
could
not
live
with
the
roses
very
long
without
becoming
beautiful
was
what
plato
thought
said
the
other
with
a
smile
many
other
wise
only
wish
that
they
might
bloom
forever
said
the
girl
should
try
her
companion
had
been
lost
in
watching
her
and
now
as
she
paused
he
said
i
have
been
happy
with
the
roses
too
miss
davis
here
is
some
music
for
your
she
gazed
at
him
eagerly
and
he
recited
half
laughingly
rose
wild
rose
sing
me
thy
song
come
let
us
sing
it
together
i
hear
the
silver
streamlet
call
from
his
home
in
the
dewy
us
sing
the
wild
dance
with
the
mountain
breeze
the
rush
of
the
mountain
rain
and
the
passionate
clasp
of
the
glowing
sun
when
the
clouds
are
rent
tell
us
the
time
for
the
song
is
short
that
the
wings
of
joy
are
fleet
but
the
soul
of
the
rose
has
bid
me
sing
that
oh
while
it
lasts
is
sweet
afterwards
helen
stood
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
a
happy
idea
came
to
her
mind
and
she
turned
towards
the
hedge
of
roses
once
more
and
threw
back
her
head
upon
the
wind
and
took
a
deep
breath
and
began
singing
a
very
beautiful
melody
as
it
swelled
out
helen
joy
increased
until
her
face
was
alight
with
laughter
and
very
wonderful
to
see
she
stood
with
the
rose
tossing
in
one
of
her
hands
and
with
the
other
pressed
upon
her
bosom
of
summer
in
one
might
have
been
sure
that
the
roses
knew
what
she
was
saying
and
that
all
about
her
loved
her
for
her
song
yet
the
girl
had
just
heard
that
the
wings
of
joy
are
fleet
and
she
was
destined
to
find
even
then
that
it
was
true
for
when
she
stopped
she
turned
to
her
companion
with
a
happy
smile
and
said
you
know
what
that
is
that
i
was
singing
when
he
said
she
went
on
is
some
music
that
somebody
made
for
me
i
think
it
is
in
the
same
book
as
the
water
lily
that
i
played
and
then
in
a
flash
the
fearful
memory
of
that
evening
came
over
the
girl
and
made
her
start
back
for
a
moment
she
stood
gazing
at
her
friend
breathing
very
hard
and
then
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
whispered
faintly
to
herself
it
was
not
a
month
ago
there
was
a
long
silence
after
that
and
when
helen
looked
up
again
the
joy
was
gone
out
of
her
face
and
she
was
the
same
frightened
soul
as
before
her
lips
were
trembling
a
little
as
she
said
howard
i
feel
somehow
that
i
have
no
right
to
be
quite
happy
for
i
have
done
nothing
to
make
myself
then
thinking
of
her
friend
she
added
am
spoiling
your
joy
in
the
roses
can
you
forgive
me
for
that
as
he
answered
that
he
could
helen
turned
away
and
said
us
go
into
the
woods
because
i
do
not
like
to
see
them
any
more
just
they
passed
beneath
the
deep
shadows
of
the
trees
and
helen
led
howard
to
the
spring
where
she
had
been
with
arthur
she
sat
down
upon
the
seat
and
then
there
was
a
long
silence
the
girl
gazing
steadfastly
in
front
of
her
she
was
thinking
of
the
last
time
she
had
been
there
and
how
it
was
likely
that
the
pale
wan
look
must
still
be
upon
arthur
face
howard
perhaps
divined
her
thought
for
he
watched
her
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
a
word
and
then
at
last
he
said
gently
as
if
to
divert
her
attention
davis
i
think
that
you
are
not
the
first
one
whom
the
sight
of
the
wild
rose
has
made
helen
turned
and
looked
at
him
and
he
gazed
gravely
into
her
eyes
for
at
least
a
minute
he
said
nothing
when
he
went
on
his
voice
was
much
changed
and
helen
knew
not
what
to
expect
davis
he
said
has
given
to
the
wild
rose
a
very
wonderful
power
of
beauty
and
joy
and
perhaps
the
man
who
looks
at
it
has
been
dreaming
all
his
life
that
somewhere
he
too
might
find
such
precious
things
and
have
them
for
his
own
when
he
sees
the
flower
there
comes
to
him
the
fearful
realization
that
with
all
the
effort
of
his
soul
he
has
never
won
the
glory
which
the
wild
rose
wears
by
heaven
free
gift
and
that
perhaps
in
his
loneliness
and
weakness
he
has
even
forgotten
all
about
such
high
perfection
so
there
rises
within
him
a
yearning
of
all
his
being
to
forget
his
misery
and
his
struggling
and
to
lay
all
his
worship
and
all
his
care
before
the
flower
that
is
so
sweet
he
is
afraid
of
his
own
sin
and
his
own
baseness
and
now
suddenly
he
finds
a
way
of
escape
that
he
will
live
no
longer
for
himself
and
his
own
happiness
but
that
his
joy
shall
be
the
rose
joy
and
all
his
life
the
rose
life
do
you
think
my
dear
friend
that
that
might
please
the
flower
said
helen
wonderingly
would
be
beautiful
if
one
could
do
the
other
spoke
more
gently
still
as
he
answered
her
his
voice
trembling
slightly
do
you
not
know
miss
davis
that
god
has
made
a
rose
the
girl
started
visibly
she
whispered
say
that
to
me
howard
why
do
you
say
that
to
and
he
fixed
his
dark
eyes
upon
her
his
voice
very
low
as
he
responded
say
it
to
you
because
i
love
and
helen
shrank
back
and
stared
at
him
and
then
as
she
saw
his
look
her
own
dropped
lower
and
lower
and
the
color
mounted
to
her
face
howard
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
very
gently
took
one
of
her
hands
in
his
and
went
on
he
said
must
let
me
call
you
helen
listen
to
me
a
while
for
i
have
something
to
tell
you
and
since
we
both
of
us
love
the
roses
so
much
perhaps
it
will
be
beautiful
to
speak
of
them
still
i
want
to
tell
you
how
the
man
who
loves
the
flower
needs
not
to
love
it
for
his
own
sake
but
may
love
it
for
the
flower
how
one
who
really
worships
beauty
worships
that
which
is
not
himself
and
the
more
he
worships
it
the
less
he
thinks
of
himself
and
helen
you
can
never
know
how
hard
a
struggle
my
life
has
been
just
to
keep
before
me
something
to
love
how
lonely
a
struggle
it
has
been
and
how
sad
i
can
only
tell
you
that
there
was
very
little
strength
left
and
very
little
beauty
and
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
remember
there
was
such
a
thing
as
joy
in
the
world
and
that
i
had
once
possessed
it
the
music
that
moved
me
and
the
music
that
i
made
was
never
your
singing
but
such
yearning
restless
music
as
you
heard
in
the
garden
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
have
loved
that
little
piece
that
i
played
then
perhaps
it
is
my
own
sad
heart
that
finds
such
breathing
passion
in
it
but
i
have
sent
it
out
into
the
darkness
of
many
a
night
dreaming
that
somewhere
it
might
waken
an
echo
for
as
long
as
the
heart
beats
it
never
ceases
to
hunger
and
to
hope
and
i
felt
that
somewhere
in
the
world
there
must
be
left
some
living
creature
that
was
beautiful
and
pure
and
that
might
be
loved
so
it
was
that
when
i
saw
you
all
my
soul
was
roused
within
me
you
were
the
fairest
of
all
god
creatures
that
i
had
ever
seen
that
was
why
i
was
so
bitter
at
first
and
that
was
why
all
my
heart
went
out
to
you
when
i
saw
your
suffering
and
why
it
is
to
me
the
dearest
memory
of
my
lifetime
that
i
was
able
to
help
you
afterwards
when
i
saw
how
true
you
were
i
was
happier
than
i
had
ever
dared
hope
to
be
again
for
when
i
went
back
to
my
lonely
little
home
it
was
no
longer
to
think
about
myself
and
my
sorrow
and
my
dullness
but
to
think
about
you
to
rejoice
in
your
salvation
and
to
pray
for
you
in
your
trouble
and
to
wait
for
the
day
when
i
might
see
you
again
and
so
i
knew
that
something
had
happened
to
me
for
which
i
had
yearned
oh
so
long
and
so
painfully
that
my
heart
had
been
taken
from
me
and
that
i
was
living
in
another
life
i
knew
dear
helen
that
i
loved
you
i
said
to
myself
long
ago
before
you
got
letter
that
i
would
wait
for
the
chance
to
say
this
to
you
to
take
your
hand
in
mine
and
say
sweet
girl
the
law
of
my
life
has
been
that
all
my
soul
i
must
give
to
the
best
thing
that
ever
i
know
and
that
thing
is
you
you
must
know
that
i
love
you
and
how
i
love
you
that
i
lay
myself
at
your
feet
and
ask
to
help
you
and
watch
over
you
and
strengthen
you
all
that
i
may
for
your
life
is
young
and
there
is
much
to
be
hoped
for
in
it
and
to
my
own
poor
self
there
is
no
longer
any
duty
that
i
owe
my
heart
is
yours
and
i
ask
for
nothing
but
that
i
may
love
you
those
were
the
words
that
i
first
meant
to
say
to
you
helen
and
to
ask
you
if
it
pleased
you
that
i
should
speak
to
you
howard
stopped
and
after
he
had
waited
a
minute
the
girl
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
she
did
not
answer
him
but
she
put
out
her
other
hand
and
laid
it
very
gently
in
his
own
there
was
a
long
silence
before
the
man
continued
at
last
he
said
helen
that
was
what
i
wished
to
say
to
you
and
no
more
than
that
because
i
believed
that
i
was
old
and
that
my
heart
was
dying
within
me
but
oh
when
that
letter
came
from
arthur
it
was
as
if
i
heard
the
voice
of
my
soul
crying
out
to
me
that
my
life
had
just
begun
that
i
had
still
to
love
as
i
came
out
here
into
the
forest
with
you
my
soul
was
full
of
a
wondrous
thought
a
thought
that
brought
more
awe
and
rapture
than
words
have
power
to
tell
it
was
that
this
precious
maiden
was
not
made
to
be
happy
alone
but
that
some
day
she
and
all
her
being
would
go
out
to
someone
to
someone
who
could
win
her
heart
who
could
love
her
and
worship
her
as
she
deserved
and
my
soul
cried
out
to
me
that
could
worship
you
the
thought
wakened
in
me
a
wilder
music
than
ever
i
had
heard
in
my
life
before
here
as
i
kneel
before
you
and
hold
your
hands
in
mine
dear
helen
all
my
being
cries
out
to
you
to
come
to
me
for
in
your
sorrow
your
heart
has
been
laid
bare
to
my
sight
and
i
have
seen
only
sweetness
and
truth
to
keep
it
and
serve
it
and
feed
it
upon
thoughts
of
beauty
would
be
all
that
i
could
care
for
in
life
and
the
thought
of
winning
you
for
mine
so
that
all
your
life
i
might
cherish
you
is
to
me
a
joy
which
brings
tears
into
my
eyes
oh
dearest
girl
i
must
live
before
you
with
that
prayer
and
tell
me
what
you
will
i
must
still
pray
it
nor
do
i
care
how
long
you
ask
me
to
wait
my
life
has
now
but
one
desire
to
love
you
in
such
a
way
as
best
may
please
you
to
love
you
as
much
as
you
will
let
me
helen
i
have
told
all
myself
to
you
and
here
as
we
gaze
into
each
other
eyes
our
souls
are
bare
to
each
other
as
i
say
those
words
they
bring
to
me
a
thought
that
sweeps
away
all
my
being
that
perhaps
the
great
sorrow
you
have
known
has
chastened
your
heart
so
that
you
too
wish
to
forget
yourself
and
worship
at
the
shrine
of
love
i
see
you
trembling
and
i
think
that
perhaps
it
may
be
that
and
that
it
needs
only
a
word
of
mine
to
bring
your
soul
to
me
what
that
thought
is
i
can
not
tell
you
but
oh
it
has
been
the
dream
of
my
life
it
has
been
the
thing
for
which
i
have
lived
and
for
which
i
was
dying
if
i
could
win
you
for
mine
helen
for
mine
and
take
you
away
with
me
away
from
all
else
but
love
the
thought
of
it
chokes
me
and
fills
me
with
mighty
anguish
of
yearning
and
my
soul
burns
for
you
and
i
stretch
out
my
arms
to
you
and
i
cry
out
to
you
that
the
happiness
of
my
life
is
in
your
hands
that
i
love
you
oh
that
i
love
you
as
the
man
had
been
speaking
he
had
sunk
down
before
helen
still
clasping
her
hands
in
his
own
a
great
trembling
had
seized
upon
the
girl
and
her
bosom
was
rising
and
falling
swiftly
but
she
mastered
herself
with
a
desperate
effort
and
looked
up
staring
at
him
tell
me
that
you
love
me
she
gasped
tell
me
that
i
am
perfect
and
yet
you
know
what
i
have
done
you
have
seen
all
my
wrongness
her
voice
broke
and
she
could
not
speak
a
word
more
she
bowed
her
head
and
the
trembling
came
again
while
the
other
clasped
her
hands
more
tightly
and
bent
towards
her
he
said
call
you
to
a
sacred
life
that
forgets
all
things
but
love
precious
girl
my
soul
cries
out
to
me
that
i
have
a
right
to
you
that
you
were
made
that
i
might
kneel
before
you
it
cries
out
to
me
the
word
and
claim
her
claim
her
for
your
own
for
no
man
could
love
her
more
than
you
love
her
tell
her
that
all
your
life
you
have
waited
for
this
sacred
hour
to
come
tell
her
that
you
have
power
and
life
and
that
all
your
soul
is
hers
and
oh
dear
heart
if
only
you
could
tell
me
that
you
might
love
me
that
years
of
waiting
might
win
you
it
would
be
such
happiness
as
i
have
never
dared
to
dream
tell
me
helen
tell
me
if
it
be
true
and
the
girl
lifted
her
face
to
him
and
he
saw
that
all
her
soul
had
leaped
into
her
eyes
her
bosom
heaved
and
she
flung
back
her
head
and
stretched
wide
her
arms
and
cried
aloud
david
i
do
love
you
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
pressed
her
upon
his
bosom
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
and
kissed
the
lips
that
had
spoken
the
wonderful
words
me
he
exclaimed
will
be
mine
and
she
answered
him
for
that
there
was
no
answer
but
the
clasp
of
his
love
at
last
he
whispered
helen
a
lifetime
of
worship
can
never
repay
you
for
words
like
those
my
life
my
soul
tell
me
once
more
for
you
can
not
be
mine
too
utterly
tell
me
once
more
that
you
are
mine
and
suddenly
she
leaned
back
her
head
and
looked
into
his
burning
eyes
and
began
swiftly
her
voice
choking
listen
listen
to
me
if
it
be
a
pleasure
to
you
to
know
how
you
have
this
heart
i
tell
you
wonderful
man
that
god
has
given
me
for
mine
that
i
loved
you
the
first
word
that
i
heard
you
speak
in
the
garden
you
were
all
that
i
knew
of
in
life
to
yearn
for
you
were
a
wonderful
light
that
had
flashed
upon
me
and
blinded
me
and
when
i
saw
my
own
vileness
in
it
i
flung
myself
down
on
my
face
and
felt
a
more
fearful
despair
than
i
had
ever
dreamed
could
torture
a
soul
i
would
have
crawled
to
you
upon
my
knees
and
groveled
in
the
dirt
and
begged
you
to
have
mercy
upon
me
and
afterwards
when
you
lifted
me
up
i
could
have
kissed
the
ground
that
you
trod
but
oh
i
knew
one
thing
and
it
was
all
that
gave
me
courage
ever
to
look
upon
you
i
heard
the
sacred
voice
of
my
womanhood
within
me
telling
me
that
i
was
not
utterly
vile
because
it
was
in
my
ignorance
that
i
had
done
my
sin
and
that
if
ever
i
had
known
what
love
really
was
i
should
have
laughed
at
the
wealth
of
empires
to
win
your
heart
i
would
fling
away
all
that
i
ever
cared
for
in
life
my
beauty
my
health
my
happiness
yes
i
would
fling
away
my
soul
and
when
you
talked
to
me
of
love
and
told
me
that
its
sacrifice
was
hard
i
i
little
girl
that
i
am
could
have
told
you
that
you
were
talking
as
a
child
and
i
thought
if
only
this
man
instead
of
urging
me
to
love
another
and
win
my
peace
if
only
were
not
afraid
to
trust
me
if
only
he
were
willing
that
i
should
love
and
this
afternoon
when
i
set
out
with
you
do
you
know
what
was
the
real
thing
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
and
made
me
so
happy
i
said
to
myself
may
take
months
and
it
may
take
years
but
there
is
a
crown
in
life
that
i
may
win
that
i
may
win
forever
and
this
man
shall
tell
me
my
duty
and
night
and
day
i
shall
watch
and
pray
to
do
it
and
do
more
and
he
will
not
know
why
i
do
it
but
it
shall
be
for
nothing
but
the
love
of
him
and
some
day
the
worship
that
is
in
his
heart
shall
come
to
me
tho
it
find
me
upon
my
and
now
you
take
me
and
tell
me
that
i
have
only
to
love
you
and
you
frighten
me
and
i
can
not
believe
that
it
is
true
but
oh
you
are
pilot
and
master
and
you
know
and
i
will
believe
you
only
tell
me
this
wonderful
thing
again
that
i
may
be
sure
that
in
spite
of
all
my
weakness
and
my
helplessness
and
my
failures
you
love
me
and
you
trust
me
and
you
ask
for
me
if
that
is
really
the
truth
david
tell
me
if
that
is
really
the
truth
david
whispered
to
her
yes
that
is
the
truth
and
the
girl
went
on
swiftly
half
sobbing
with
her
emotion
you
tell
me
that
what
more
do
i
need
to
know
you
are
my
life
and
my
soul
and
you
call
me
for
the
glory
of
your
wonderful
love
i
will
leave
all
the
rest
of
the
world
behind
me
and
you
may
take
me
where
you
will
and
when
you
will
and
do
with
me
what
you
please
and
oh
you
who
frightened
me
so
about
my
wrongness
and
told
me
how
hard
it
was
to
be
right
do
you
know
how
easy
it
is
for
me
to
say
those
words
and
do
you
know
how
happy
i
am
because
i
love
you
and
you
are
mine
david
my
david
my
heart
has
been
so
full
so
wild
and
thirsty
that
now
when
you
tell
me
that
you
want
all
my
love
it
is
a
word
of
glory
to
me
it
tells
me
to
be
happy
as
never
in
my
life
have
i
been
happy
before
and
david
bent
towards
her
and
kissed
her
upon
her
beautiful
lips
and
upon
her
forehead
and
he
pressed
the
trembling
form
closer
upon
him
so
that
the
heaving
of
her
bosom
answered
to
his
own
my
love
my
precious
heart
he
whispered
will
tell
you
about
the
vision
of
my
life
now
when
you
and
i
are
thus
heart
to
heart
helen
my
soul
cries
out
that
this
union
must
be
perfect
in
mind
and
soul
and
body
a
blending
of
all
ourselves
so
that
we
may
live
in
each
other
hearts
and
seek
each
other
perfection
so
that
we
may
have
nothing
one
from
the
other
but
be
one
and
the
same
soul
in
the
glory
of
our
love
that
is
such
a
sacred
thought
my
life
my
darling
it
makes
all
my
being
a
song
and
as
i
clasp
you
to
me
thus
and
kiss
you
i
feel
that
i
have
never
been
so
near
to
god
i
have
worshiped
all
my
days
in
the
great
religion
of
love
and
now
as
the
glory
of
it
burns
in
my
heart
i
feel
lifted
above
even
us
and
see
that
it
is
because
of
him
that
we
love
each
other
so
because
he
is
one
our
souls
may
be
one
actually
and
really
one
so
that
each
loses
himself
and
lives
the
other
life
i
know
that
i
love
you
so
that
i
can
fling
my
whole
self
away
and
give
up
every
thought
in
life
but
you
as
i
tell
you
that
my
heart
is
bursting
oh
drink
in
this
passion
of
mine
and
tell
me
once
more
that
you
love
me
helen
had
still
been
leaning
back
her
head
and
gazing
into
his
eyes
all
her
soul
uplifted
in
the
glory
of
her
emotion
there
was
a
wild
look
upon
her
face
and
her
breath
was
coming
swiftly
for
a
moment
more
she
gazed
at
him
and
then
she
buried
her
face
on
his
shoulder
crying
mine
for
a
long
time
she
clung
to
him
breathing
the
word
and
quite
lost
in
the
joy
of
it
until
at
last
she
leaned
back
her
head
and
gazed
up
into
his
eyes
once
more
david
she
said
can
i
answer
you
i
can
only
tell
you
one
thing
that
here
i
am
in
your
arms
and
that
i
am
yours
yours
and
i
love
you
oh
before
god
i
love
you
with
all
my
soul
and
i
am
so
happy
oh
david
so
happy
dearest
heart
can
you
not
see
how
you
have
won
me
so
that
i
can
not
live
without
you
so
that
anything
you
ask
of
me
you
may
have
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
because
i
am
trembling
so
and
i
am
so
weak
for
this
has
been
more
than
i
can
bear
it
is
as
if
all
my
being
were
melting
within
me
but
oh
i
never
thought
that
a
human
being
could
be
so
happy
or
that
to
love
could
be
such
a
world
of
wonder
and
helen
as
she
had
been
speaking
had
sunk
down
exhaustedly
letting
her
head
fall
forward
upon
her
bosom
she
lay
quite
limp
in
arms
while
little
by
little
the
agitation
that
had
so
shaken
her
subsided
in
the
meantime
he
was
bending
over
the
golden
hair
that
was
so
wild
and
so
beautiful
and
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
when
at
last
the
girl
was
quiet
she
leaned
back
her
head
upon
his
arm
and
looked
up
into
his
face
and
he
bent
over
her
and
pressed
a
kiss
upon
her
mouth
helen
gazed
into
his
eyes
and
asked
him
do
you
really
know
what
you
have
done
to
this
little
maiden
how
fearfully
and
how
madly
you
have
made
her
yours
i
never
dreamed
of
what
it
could
mean
to
love
before
when
men
talked
to
me
of
it
i
laughed
at
them
and
the
touch
of
their
hands
made
me
shrink
and
now
here
i
am
and
everything
about
me
is
changed
take
me
away
with
you
david
and
keep
me
i
do
not
care
what
becomes
of
me
if
only
you
let
me
have
your
the
girl
closed
her
eyes
and
lay
still
again
for
a
long
time
when
she
began
to
speak
once
more
it
was
softly
and
very
slowly
and
half
as
if
in
a
dream
she
whispered
david
i
am
tired
i
think
i
never
felt
so
helpless
but
oh
dear
heart
it
seems
a
kind
of
music
in
my
soul
that
i
have
cast
all
my
sorrow
away
and
that
i
may
be
happy
again
and
be
at
peace
at
peace
and
the
girl
repeated
the
words
to
herself
more
and
more
gently
until
her
voice
had
died
away
altogether
the
other
was
silent
for
a
long
time
gazing
down
upon
the
perfect
face
and
then
at
last
he
kissed
the
trembling
eyelids
till
they
opened
once
again
girl
he
whispered
god
gives
me
life
you
shall
never
be
sorry
for
that
beautiful
faith
or
sorry
that
you
have
laid
bare
your
heart
to
long
afterwards
having
watched
her
without
speaking
he
went
on
with
a
smile
wonder
if
you
would
not
be
happier
yet
dearest
if
i
should
tell
you
all
the
beautiful
things
that
i
mean
to
do
with
you
for
now
that
you
are
all
mine
i
am
going
to
carry
you
far
away
you
will
like
that
will
you
not
precious
one
he
saw
a
little
of
an
old
light
come
back
into
helen
eyes
as
he
asked
that
question
difference
does
it
make
she
asked
gently
david
laughed
and
went
on
well
then
you
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
shall
take
you
in
my
arms
just
as
you
are
and
i
have
a
beautiful
little
house
a
very
little
house
among
the
wildest
of
mountains
and
there
we
shall
live
this
wonderful
summer
all
alone
with
our
wonderful
love
and
there
we
shall
have
nature
to
worship
and
beautiful
music
and
beautiful
books
to
read
you
shall
never
have
anything
more
to
think
about
all
your
life
but
making
yourself
perfect
and
the
girl
had
raised
herself
up
and
was
gazing
at
him
with
interest
as
he
spoke
thus
but
he
saw
a
swift
frown
cross
her
features
at
his
last
words
and
he
stopped
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
helen
reply
was
delivered
very
gravely
i
was
to
think
about
she
said
settled
long
ago
and
i
wish
you
would
not
say
wicked
things
like
that
to
a
moment
later
she
laughed
at
herself
a
little
but
then
pushing
back
her
tangled
hair
from
her
forehead
she
went
on
seriously
what
you
tell
me
of
is
all
that
i
ever
thought
of
enjoying
in
life
and
yet
i
am
so
glad
that
you
did
not
say
anything
about
it
before
for
i
want
to
love
you
because
of
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
would
follow
you
and
worship
you
and
live
in
your
love
if
there
were
nothing
else
in
life
for
you
to
offer
me
and
david
do
you
not
see
that
you
are
never
going
to
make
this
poor
restless
creature
happy
until
you
have
given
her
something
stern
to
do
something
that
she
may
know
she
is
doing
just
for
your
love
and
for
nothing
else
bearing
some
effort
and
pain
to
make
you
happy
the
girl
had
put
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
was
gazing
earnestly
into
his
eyes
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
responded
in
a
low
voice
dearest
let
us
not
play
with
fearful
words
and
let
us
not
tempt
sorrow
my
life
has
not
been
all
happiness
and
you
will
have
pain
enough
to
share
with
me
i
fear
poor
little
she
thought
in
a
flash
of
his
sickness
and
she
turned
quite
pale
as
she
looked
at
him
but
then
she
bent
forward
gently
and
folded
her
arms
about
him
and
for
a
minute
more
there
was
silence
there
were
tears
standing
in
david
eyes
when
she
looked
at
him
again
but
he
smiled
in
spite
of
them
and
kissed
her
once
more
and
said
it
is
not
wrong
that
we
should
be
happy
while
we
can
and
come
what
may
you
know
we
need
not
ever
cease
to
love
when
i
hear
such
noble
words
from
you
i
think
i
have
a
medicine
to
make
all
sickness
light
so
be
bright
and
beautiful
once
more
for
my
helen
smiled
and
answered
that
she
would
and
then
her
eye
chanced
to
light
upon
the
ground
where
she
saw
the
wild
rose
lying
forgotten
she
stooped
down
and
picked
it
up
and
then
knelt
on
the
grass
beside
david
and
pressed
it
against
his
bosom
while
she
gazed
up
into
his
face
she
said
smiling
tenderly
read
a
pretty
little
stanza
and
if
you
will
love
me
more
for
it
i
will
tell
it
to
you
sweetest
flower
that
blows
i
give
you
as
we
part
to
you
it
is
a
rose
to
me
it
is
a
heart
and
the
man
took
the
flower
and
took
the
hands
too
and
kissed
them
then
a
memory
chanced
to
come
to
him
and
he
glanced
about
him
on
the
forest
floor
he
saw
some
little
leaves
that
all
love
and
he
stooped
and
picked
one
of
the
gleaming
white
blossoms
and
laid
it
in
helen
hands
he
said
is
beautiful
to
make
love
with
the
flowers
i
chanced
to
think
how
i
once
a
pretty
little
poem
and
if
you
will
love
me
more
for
it
i
will
tell
it
to
then
while
the
girl
gazed
at
him
happily
he
went
on
to
add
was
long
before
i
knew
you
dear
and
when
i
worshiped
the
flowers
one
of
them
was
this
little
wood
sorrel
i
found
it
in
the
forest
dark
a
blossom
of
the
snow
i
read
upon
its
face
so
fair
no
heed
of
human
woe
yet
when
i
sang
my
passion
song
and
when
the
sun
rose
higher
the
flower
flung
wide
its
heart
to
me
and
lo
its
heart
was
helen
gazed
at
him
a
moment
after
he
finished
and
then
she
took
the
little
flower
and
laid
it
gently
back
in
the
group
from
which
he
had
plucked
it
afterwards
she
looked
up
and
laughed
want
that
poem
for
myself
she
said
and
drew
closer
to
him
and
put
her
arms
about
him
he
gazed
into
her
upraised
face
and
there
was
a
look
of
wonder
in
his
eyes
precious
girl
he
said
wonder
if
you
know
what
a
vision
of
beauty
god
has
made
you
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
fair
your
eyes
are
if
you
know
what
glory
a
man
may
read
in
your
face
helen
when
i
look
upon
you
i
know
that
god
has
meant
to
pay
me
for
all
my
years
of
pain
and
it
is
all
that
i
can
do
to
think
that
you
are
really
really
mine
do
you
not
know
that
to
gaze
upon
you
will
make
me
a
mad
mad
creature
for
years
and
years
and
years
helen
answered
him
gravely
all
my
beauty
david
i
am
really
really
yours
and
i
love
you
so
that
i
do
not
care
anything
in
the
world
about
being
beautiful
except
because
it
makes
you
happy
to
do
that
i
shall
be
always
just
as
perfect
as
i
may
thro
all
those
mad
years
and
years
and
years
then
as
she
glanced
about
her
she
added
must
go
pretty
soon
because
it
is
late
but
oh
before
we
do
sweetheart
will
you
kiss
me
once
more
for
all
those
years
and
years
and
years
and
david
bent
over
and
clasped
her
in
his
arms
again

of

i

ii
summer
gathers
up
her
robes
of
glory
and
like
a
dream
of
beauty
glides
chapter
i
the
hills
and
far
away
beyond
their
utmost
purple
rim
and
deep
into
the
dying
day
the
happy
princess
follow
it
was
several
months
after
helen
marriage
the
scene
was
a
little
lake
in
one
of
the
wildest
parts
of
the
adirondacks
surrounded
by
tall
mountains
which
converted
it
into
a
basin
in
the
land
and
walled
in
by
a
dense
growth
about
the
shores
which
added
still
more
to
its
appearance
of
seclusion
in
only
one
place
was
the
scenery
more
open
where
there
was
a
little
vale
between
two
of
the
hills
and
where
a
mountain
torrent
came
rushing
down
the
steep
incline
there
the
underbrush
had
been
cleared
away
and
beneath
the
great
forest
trees
a
house
constructed
a
little
cabin
built
of
logs
and
in
harmony
with
the
rest
of
the
scene
it
was
only
large
enough
for
two
or
three
rooms
downstairs
and
as
many
above
and
all
were
furnished
in
the
plainest
way
about
the
main
room
there
were
shelves
of
books
and
a
piano
and
a
it
was
the
little
home
which
for
a
dozen
years
or
more
david
howard
had
occupied
alone
and
where
he
and
helen
had
spent
the
golden
summer
of
their
love
it
was
late
in
the
fall
then
and
the
mountains
were
robed
in
scarlet
and
orange
helen
was
standing
upon
the
little
piazza
a
shawl
flung
about
her
shoulders
because
it
was
yet
early
in
the
morning
she
was
talking
to
her
father
who
had
been
paying
them
a
few
days
visit
and
was
taking
a
last
look
about
him
at
the
fresh
morning
scene
before
it
was
time
for
him
to
begin
his
long
homeward
journey
helen
was
clad
in
a
simple
dress
and
with
the
prettiest
of
white
sun
bonnets
tied
upon
her
head
she
was
browned
by
the
sun
and
looked
a
picture
of
health
and
happiness
as
she
held
her
arm
in
hers
then
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
are
happy
he
was
saying
as
he
looked
at
her
radiant
face
she
echoed
the
word
and
then
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
took
a
deep
breath
and
echoed
it
again
am
so
happy
she
laughed
never
know
what
to
do
you
did
not
stay
long
enough
for
me
to
tell
you
daddy
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
think
there
never
was
anybody
in
the
world
so
full
of
joy
for
this
is
such
a
beautiful
little
home
you
know
and
we
live
such
a
beautiful
life
and
oh
we
love
each
other
so
that
the
days
seem
to
fly
by
like
the
wind
i
never
even
have
time
to
think
how
happy
i
husband
really
loves
you
as
much
as
he
ought
said
the
father
gazing
at
her
tenderly
think
god
never
put
on
earth
another
such
man
as
david
replied
the
girl
with
sudden
gravity
is
so
noble
and
so
unselfish
in
every
little
thing
i
see
it
in
his
eyes
every
instant
that
all
his
life
is
lived
for
nothing
but
to
win
my
love
and
it
just
draws
the
heart
right
out
of
me
daddy
so
that
i
could
live
on
my
knees
before
him
just
trying
to
tell
him
how
much
i
love
him
i
can
not
ever
love
him
enough
but
it
grows
it
grows
like
great
music
and
every
day
my
heart
is
more
full
helen
was
standing
with
her
head
thrown
back
gazing
ahead
of
her
then
she
turned
and
laughed
and
put
her
arm
about
her
father
again
saying
you
just
seen
what
a
beautiful
life
we
live
and
oh
daddy
most
of
the
time
i
am
afraid
because
i
married
david
when
i
see
how
much
he
knows
just
think
of
it
he
has
lived
all
alone
ever
since
he
was
young
and
done
nothing
but
read
and
study
now
he
brings
all
those
treasures
to
me
to
make
me
happy
with
and
he
frightens
she
stopped
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
earnestly
have
to
be
able
to
go
with
him
everywhere
you
know
i
ca
expect
him
to
stay
back
all
his
life
for
me
and
that
makes
me
work
very
hard
david
says
that
there
is
one
duty
in
the
world
higher
than
love
and
that
is
the
duty
of
labor
that
no
soul
in
the
world
can
be
right
for
one
instant
if
it
is
standing
still
and
is
satisfied
even
with
the
soul
it
loves
he
told
me
that
before
he
married
me
but
at
first
when
we
came
up
here
he
was
so
impatient
that
he
quite
frightened
me
but
now
i
have
learned
to
understand
it
all
and
we
are
wonderfully
one
in
everything
daddy
dear
is
it
a
beautiful
way
to
live
to
be
always
striving
and
having
something
high
and
sacred
in
one
mind
and
to
make
all
of
one
life
from
one
own
heart
and
not
to
be
dependent
upon
anything
else
david
and
i
live
away
off
here
in
the
mountains
and
we
never
have
anything
of
what
other
people
call
comforts
and
enjoyments
we
have
nothing
but
a
few
books
and
a
little
music
and
nature
and
our
own
love
and
we
are
so
wonderfully
happy
with
just
those
that
nothing
else
in
the
world
could
make
any
difference
certainly
nothing
that
money
could
buy
was
worried
when
you
wrote
me
that
you
did
not
even
have
a
servant
said
davis
is
any
trouble
laughed
helen
david
man
lived
in
the
village
half
a
mile
away
and
came
over
every
day
to
bring
what
was
necessary
is
such
a
tiny
little
cottage
and
david
and
i
are
very
enthusiastic
people
and
we
want
to
be
able
to
make
lots
of
noise
and
do
just
as
we
please
we
have
so
much
music
you
know
daddy
and
of
course
david
is
quite
a
wild
man
when
he
gets
excited
with
helen
stopped
and
looked
at
her
father
and
laughed
then
she
rattled
merrily
on
are
both
of
us
just
two
children
for
david
is
so
much
in
love
with
me
that
it
makes
him
as
young
as
i
am
and
we
are
away
off
from
everything
and
so
we
can
be
as
happy
with
each
other
as
we
choose
we
have
this
little
lake
all
to
ourselves
you
know
it
getting
cold
now
and
pretty
soon
we
have
to
fly
away
to
the
south
but
all
this
summer
long
we
used
to
get
up
in
the
morning
in
time
to
see
the
sun
rise
and
to
have
a
wonderful
swim
and
then
we
have
so
many
things
to
read
and
study
and
david
talks
to
me
and
tells
me
all
that
he
knows
and
besides
all
that
we
have
to
tell
each
other
how
much
we
love
each
other
which
takes
a
fearful
amount
of
time
it
seems
that
neither
of
us
can
ever
quite
realize
the
glory
of
it
and
when
we
think
of
it
it
is
a
wonder
that
nobody
ever
told
is
not
that
a
beautiful
way
to
live
daddy
dear
and
to
love
said
davis
is
a
very
beautiful
way
indeed
and
i
think
that
my
little
girl
has
all
that
i
could
wish
her
to
there
is
no
need
to
tell
me
that
laughed
helen
i
wish
is
that
i
might
really
be
like
david
and
be
worth
his
love
i
never
think
about
anything
else
all
the
girl
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
at
her
father
and
then
looking
more
serious
she
put
her
arm
about
him
and
whispered
softly
oh
daddy
it
is
too
wonderful
to
talk
about
but
i
ought
to
tell
you
for
some
day
by
and
by
god
is
going
to
send
us
a
new
oh
a
new
new
wonder
and
helen
blushed
beautifully
as
her
father
gazed
into
her
eyes
he
took
her
hand
tenderly
in
his
own
and
the
two
stood
for
some
time
in
silence
when
it
was
broken
it
was
by
the
rattling
of
the
wagon
which
had
come
to
take
davis
away
david
came
out
then
to
bid
his
guest
and
the
three
stood
for
a
few
minutes
conversing
it
was
not
very
difficult
for
helen
to
take
leave
of
her
father
for
she
would
see
him
so
she
said
in
a
week
or
two
more
she
stood
waving
her
hands
to
him
until
the
bumping
wagon
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
woods
and
then
she
turned
and
took
david
hand
in
hers
and
gazed
across
the
water
at
the
mountains
the
lake
was
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
and
the
sky
was
bright
and
clear
but
helen
thoughts
took
a
different
turn
from
that
all
summer
long
she
had
been
rejoicing
in
the
glory
of
the
landscape
about
her
in
the
glowing
fern
and
the
underfoot
and
in
the
boundless
canopy
of
green
above
with
its
unresting
now
there
were
only
the
shrill
cries
of
a
pair
of
to
be
heard
and
every
puff
of
wind
that
came
brought
down
a
shower
of
rustling
leaves
to
the
already
ground
it
not
sad
david
the
girl
said
think
how
the
beauty
should
all
be
going
david
did
not
answer
her
for
a
moment
i
think
of
it
he
said
at
last
brings
me
not
so
much
sadness
as
a
strange
feeling
of
mystery
only
stop
and
think
of
what
that
vanished
springtime
meant
think
that
it
was
a
presence
of
living
feeling
growing
creatures
infinite
unthinkable
masses
of
them
robing
all
the
world
and
that
now
the
life
and
the
glory
of
it
all
is
suddenly
gone
back
into
nothingness
that
it
was
all
but
a
fleeting
vision
a
phantom
presence
on
the
earth
i
never
realize
that
without
coming
to
think
of
all
the
other
things
of
life
and
that
they
too
are
no
more
real
than
the
springtime
flowers
and
so
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
were
walking
upon
air
and
living
in
a
helen
was
leaning
against
a
post
of
the
piazza
her
eyes
fixed
upon
david
intently
that
not
give
a
new
meaning
to
the
vanished
he
asked
her
and
she
replied
in
a
wondering
whisper
and
then
gazed
at
him
for
a
long
time
she
said
at
last
is
fearful
to
think
of
a
thing
like
that
what
does
it
all
mean
what
causes
it
have
been
asking
that
helpless
question
since
the
dawn
of
time
he
answered
only
know
what
we
see
this
whirling
and
weaving
of
shadows
with
its
sacred
facts
of
beauty
and
helen
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
a
moment
and
then
recollecting
something
she
had
heard
from
her
father
she
said
david
if
god
be
a
mystery
like
that
how
can
there
be
any
religion
we
may
fancy
god
to
be
makes
no
difference
he
answered
which
we
know
is
always
the
same
we
have
always
the
love
and
always
the
beauty
all
men
religion
is
but
the
assertion
that
the
source
of
these
sacred
things
must
be
infinitely
sacred
and
that
whatever
may
happen
to
us
that
source
can
suffer
no
harm
that
we
live
by
a
power
stronger
than
ourselves
and
that
has
no
need
of
helen
was
looking
at
her
husband
anxiously
then
suddenly
she
asked
him
tell
me
then
david
you
do
not
believe
in
heaven
you
do
not
believe
that
our
souls
are
immortal
as
he
answered
her
in
the
negative
she
gave
a
slight
start
and
knitted
her
brows
and
after
another
pause
she
demanded
do
not
believe
in
revealed
religion
then
david
could
not
help
smiling
recognizing
the
voice
of
his
clerical
when
he
answered
however
he
was
serious
again
day
perhaps
dear
helen
he
said
will
tell
you
all
about
what
i
think
as
to
such
things
but
very
few
of
the
world
real
thinkers
believe
in
revealed
religions
any
more
they
have
come
to
see
them
simply
as
guesses
of
humanity
at
god
great
sacred
mystery
and
to
believe
that
god
way
of
revealing
himself
to
men
is
through
the
forms
of
life
itself
as
to
the
question
of
immortality
that
you
speak
of
i
have
always
felt
that
death
is
a
sign
of
the
fact
that
god
is
infinite
and
perfect
and
that
we
are
but
shadows
in
his
sight
that
we
live
by
a
power
that
is
not
our
own
and
seek
for
beauty
that
is
not
our
own
and
that
each
instant
of
our
lives
is
a
free
gift
which
we
can
only
repay
by
thankfulness
and
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
the
girl
who
had
still
been
gazing
at
him
thoughtfully
went
on
used
to
talk
about
those
things
to
me
david
and
he
showed
me
how
the
life
of
men
is
all
spent
in
suffering
and
struggling
and
that
therefore
faith
teaches
us
dearest
the
other
put
in
know
all
that
you
are
going
to
say
i
have
read
these
arguments
very
often
you
know
but
suppose
that
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
think
suffering
and
struggling
is
the
very
essence
of
the
soul
and
that
what
faith
teaches
us
is
that
the
suffering
and
struggling
are
sacred
and
not
in
the
least
that
they
are
some
day
to
be
made
as
nothing
dearest
if
it
is
true
that
the
soul
makes
this
life
what
it
is
a
life
of
restless
seeking
for
an
infinite
would
it
not
make
the
same
life
anywhere
else
do
you
remember
reading
with
me
emerson
poem
about
uriel
the
seraph
who
sang
before
god
throne
how
even
that
could
not
please
him
and
how
he
left
it
to
plunge
into
the
struggle
of
things
imperfect
and
how
ever
after
the
rest
of
the
seraphim
were
afraid
of
uriel
do
you
think
dearest
that
this
life
of
love
and
labor
that
you
and
i
live
our
own
selves
needs
anything
else
to
justify
it
the
life
that
i
lived
all
alone
was
much
harder
and
more
full
of
pain
than
this
but
i
never
thought
that
it
needed
any
david
stopped
and
stood
gazing
ahead
of
him
thoughtfully
when
he
continued
his
voice
was
lower
and
more
solemn
things
are
almost
too
sacred
to
talk
of
helen
he
said
there
is
one
doubt
that
i
have
known
about
this
one
thing
that
has
made
me
wonder
if
there
ought
not
to
be
another
world
after
all
i
never
sympathized
with
any
man
longing
for
heaven
but
i
can
understand
how
a
man
might
be
haunted
by
some
fearful
baseness
of
his
own
self
something
which
long
years
of
effort
had
taught
him
he
could
not
ever
expiate
by
the
strength
of
his
own
heart
and
how
he
could
pray
that
there
might
be
some
place
where
rightness
might
be
won
at
last
cost
what
it
the
man
tone
had
been
so
strange
as
he
spoke
that
it
caused
helen
to
start
suddenly
she
came
closer
to
him
and
put
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
gazed
into
his
eyes
she
whispered
to
me
a
dear
he
said
is
it
it
because
of
yourself
that
you
said
those
words
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
gazing
into
her
anxious
eyes
then
he
bowed
his
head
and
said
in
a
faint
voice
dear
it
was
because
of
and
the
girl
becoming
suddenly
very
serious
went
on
you
remember
david
a
long
time
ago
the
time
that
i
was
leaving
aunt
polly
that
you
told
me
how
you
knew
what
it
was
to
have
something
very
terrible
on
one
conscience
i
have
not
ever
said
anything
about
that
but
i
have
never
forgotten
it
was
it
that
that
you
thought
of
then
dear
it
was
that
answered
the
other
trembling
slightly
helen
stooped
down
upon
her
knees
and
put
her
arms
about
him
gazing
up
pleadingly
into
his
face
david
she
whispered
it
right
to
refuse
to
tell
me
about
that
sorrow
there
was
a
long
silence
after
which
the
man
replied
slowly
have
not
ever
refused
to
tell
you
sweetheart
it
would
be
very
fearful
to
tell
but
i
have
not
any
secrets
from
you
and
if
you
wished
it
you
should
know
but
dear
it
was
long
long
ago
and
nothing
can
ever
change
it
now
it
would
only
make
us
sad
to
know
it
so
why
should
we
talk
of
it
he
stopped
and
helen
gazed
long
and
earnestly
into
his
face
she
said
is
not
possible
for
me
to
imagine
you
ever
doing
anything
wrong
you
are
so
said
david
is
because
you
are
so
good
but
helen
interrupted
him
at
that
with
a
quick
rejoinder
you
forget
that
i
too
have
a
sorrow
upon
my
conscience
afterwards
as
she
saw
that
the
eager
remark
caused
the
other
to
smile
in
spite
of
himself
she
checked
him
gravely
with
the
words
you
really
forgotten
so
soon
do
you
suppose
i
do
not
ever
think
now
of
how
i
treated
poor
arthur
and
how
i
drove
away
from
me
the
best
friend
of
my
girlhood
he
wrote
me
that
he
would
think
of
me
no
more
but
david
sometimes
i
wonder
if
it
were
not
just
an
angry
boast
and
if
he
might
not
yet
be
lonely
and
wretched
somewhere
in
this
great
cold
world
where
i
can
not
ever
find
him
or
help
the
girl
paused
david
was
regarding
her
earnestly
and
for
a
long
time
neither
of
them
spoke
then
suddenly
the
man
bent
down
and
pressed
a
kiss
upon
her
forehead
us
only
love
each
other
dear
he
whispered
try
to
keep
as
right
as
we
can
while
the
time
is
given
there
was
a
long
silence
after
that
while
the
two
sat
gazing
out
across
the
blue
lake
when
helen
spoke
again
it
was
to
say
day
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
david
because
i
can
help
you
but
let
us
not
talk
about
these
dreadful
things
she
stopped
again
and
afterwards
went
on
thoughtfully
was
thinking
still
of
what
you
said
about
immortality
and
how
very
strange
it
is
to
think
of
ceasing
to
be
might
it
not
be
david
that
heaven
is
a
place
not
of
reward
but
of
the
same
ceaseless
effort
as
you
spoke
of
yes
said
the
other
is
the
thought
of
wages
of
going
on
and
of
course
dear
we
would
all
like
those
wages
there
is
no
thought
that
tempts
me
so
much
as
the
possibility
of
being
able
to
continue
the
great
race
forever
but
i
do
see
how
we
have
the
least
right
to
demand
it
or
that
the
facts
give
us
the
least
reason
to
suppose
that
we
will
get
it
it
seems
to
me
simply
a
fantastic
and
arbitrary
fancy
the
of
a
life
in
that
way
i
do
not
think
dearest
that
i
am
in
the
least
justified
in
claiming
an
eternity
of
vision
because
god
gives
me
an
hour
and
when
i
ask
him
the
question
in
my
own
heart
i
learn
simply
that
i
am
a
wretched
sodden
creature
that
i
do
not
crowd
that
hour
with
all
infinity
and
go
quite
mad
at
the
sight
of
the
beauty
that
he
flings
wide
before
helen
did
not
reply
for
a
while
and
then
she
asked
you
think
david
that
our
life
justifies
itself
no
matter
how
much
suffering
may
be
in
it
think
dearest
was
his
reply
the
soul
life
is
struggle
and
that
the
soul
life
is
sacred
and
that
to
be
right
to
struggle
to
be
right
is
not
only
life
purpose
but
also
reward
and
that
each
instant
of
such
righteousness
is
its
own
warrant
tho
the
man
be
swept
out
of
existence
in
the
then
david
stopped
and
when
he
went
on
it
was
in
a
lower
voice
helen
he
said
i
have
told
you
what
i
feel
i
deserve
in
life
you
can
understand
my
not
wishing
to
talk
lightly
about
such
things
as
suffering
just
now
as
i
sit
here
at
my
ease
and
in
fact
all
through
my
poor
life
i
have
felt
about
such
sacred
words
as
duty
and
righteousness
that
it
would
be
just
as
well
if
they
did
not
ever
pass
my
lips
but
there
have
come
to
me
one
or
two
times
dear
when
i
dared
a
little
of
the
labor
of
things
and
drank
a
drop
or
two
of
the
wine
of
the
spirit
and
those
times
have
lived
to
haunt
me
and
make
me
at
least
not
a
happy
man
in
my
unearned
ease
there
come
to
me
still
just
once
in
a
while
hours
when
i
get
sight
of
the
gleam
hours
that
make
me
loathe
all
that
in
my
hours
of
comfort
i
loved
and
there
comes
over
me
then
a
kind
of
titanic
rage
that
i
should
go
down
a
beaten
soul
because
i
have
not
the
iron
strength
of
will
to
lash
my
own
self
to
life
and
tear
out
of
my
own
heart
a
little
of
what
power
is
in
it
at
such
times
helen
i
find
just
this
one
wish
in
my
mind
that
god
would
send
to
me
cost
what
it
might
some
of
the
fearful
experience
that
rouses
a
man
soul
within
him
and
makes
him
live
his
life
in
spite
of
all
his
dullness
and
his
david
had
not
finished
but
he
halted
because
he
saw
a
strange
look
upon
the
girl
face
she
did
not
answer
him
at
once
but
sat
gazing
at
him
and
then
she
said
in
a
very
grave
voice
i
do
not
like
to
hear
such
words
as
that
from
words
dearest
you
mean
actually
that
it
sometimes
seems
to
you
wrong
to
live
happily
with
me
as
you
have
david
laid
his
hand
quietly
upon
hers
watching
for
a
minute
her
anxious
countenance
then
he
said
in
a
low
voice
ought
not
to
ask
me
about
such
things
dear
or
blame
me
for
them
sometimes
i
have
to
face
the
very
cruel
thought
that
i
ought
not
ever
to
have
linked
my
fate
to
one
so
sweet
and
gentle
as
you
because
what
i
ought
to
be
doing
in
the
world
to
win
a
right
conscience
is
something
so
hard
and
so
stern
that
it
would
mean
that
i
could
never
be
really
happy
all
my
david
was
about
to
go
on
but
he
stopped
again
because
of
look
of
displeasure
she
whispered
is
the
most
unloving
thing
that
i
have
ever
heard
from
you
you
must
blame
me
dear
because
of
it
he
asked
suppose
helen
answered
you
would
misunderstand
me
as
long
as
i
chose
to
let
you
do
you
not
suppose
that
i
too
have
a
conscience
do
you
suppose
that
i
want
any
happiness
it
is
wrong
for
us
to
take
or
that
i
would
not
dare
to
go
anywhere
that
your
duty
took
you
and
do
you
suppose
that
anything
could
be
so
painful
to
me
as
to
know
that
you
do
not
trust
me
that
you
are
afraid
to
live
your
life
and
do
what
is
your
duty
before
me
david
bent
down
suddenly
and
pressed
a
kiss
upon
the
forehead
little
heart
he
whispered
words
are
very
did
not
say
them
because
they
were
beautiful
answered
helen
gravely
said
them
because
i
meant
them
and
because
i
wanted
you
to
take
them
in
earnest
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
that
you
and
i
ought
to
be
doing
instead
of
enjoying
our
lives
and
after
you
have
told
me
what
it
is
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
that
i
shall
not
be
happy
again
in
my
life
until
it
is
david
watched
her
thoughtfully
a
while
before
he
answered
because
he
saw
that
she
was
very
much
in
earnest
then
he
said
sadly
helen
perhaps
the
reason
that
i
have
never
been
able
all
through
my
life
to
satisfy
my
soul
is
the
pitiful
fact
that
i
have
not
the
strength
to
dare
any
of
the
work
of
other
men
i
have
had
always
to
chafe
under
the
fact
that
i
must
choose
between
nourishing
my
poor
body
or
ceasing
to
live
i
have
learned
that
all
my
power
and
more
too
as
it
sometimes
seemed
was
needed
to
bear
bravely
the
dreadful
trials
that
god
has
sent
to
helen
paled
slightly
she
felt
his
hand
trembling
upon
hers
and
she
remembered
his
illness
at
her
aunt
about
which
she
had
never
had
the
courage
to
speak
to
him
so
dear
heart
he
went
on
slowly
us
only
be
sure
that
we
are
keeping
our
lives
pure
and
strong
that
we
are
living
in
the
presence
of
high
thoughts
and
keeping
the
mastery
of
ourselves
and
saying
and
really
meaning
that
we
live
for
something
unselfish
so
that
if
duty
and
danger
come
we
shall
not
prove
cowards
and
if
suffering
comes
we
should
not
give
way
and
lose
our
faith
does
that
please
you
dear
helen
the
girl
pressed
his
hand
silently
in
hers
after
a
while
he
went
on
still
more
solemnly
time
he
said
meant
to
talk
to
you
about
just
that
dearest
to
tell
you
how
stern
and
how
watchful
we
ought
to
be
it
is
very
sad
to
me
to
see
what
happens
when
the
great
and
fearful
realities
of
life
disclose
themselves
to
good
and
kind
people
who
have
been
living
without
any
thought
of
such
things
i
feel
that
it
is
very
wrong
to
live
so
that
if
we
wished
to
be
right
we
would
hold
the
high
truths
before
us
no
matter
how
much
labor
it
truths
do
you
mean
asked
helen
earnestly
and
he
answered
her
one
the
very
fearful
fact
of
which
i
have
just
been
talking
that
you
and
i
are
two
bubbles
that
meet
for
an
instant
upon
the
whirling
stream
of
time
suppose
sweetheart
that
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
do
not
think
you
and
i
would
be
living
our
lives
truly
until
we
were
quite
sure
that
we
could
bear
to
be
parted
forever
without
losing
our
faith
in
god
righteousness
helen
turned
quite
white
and
clutched
the
other
hands
in
hers
she
had
not
once
thought
of
actually
applying
what
he
had
said
to
her
david
she
cried
the
man
smiled
gently
as
he
brushed
back
the
hair
from
her
forehead
and
gazed
into
her
eyes
when
you
asked
for
sternness
dear
he
said
it
that
you
did
not
know
what
the
word
meant
life
is
real
dear
helen
and
the
effort
it
demands
is
real
the
girl
did
not
half
hear
these
last
words
she
was
still
staring
at
her
husband
to
me
david
she
said
at
last
still
holding
his
hand
tightly
in
hers
her
voice
almost
a
whisper
could
bear
anything
for
you
david
i
know
that
i
could
bear
i
could
really
die
for
you
i
say
that
with
all
my
soul
that
was
what
i
was
thinking
of
when
you
spoke
of
death
but
david
if
you
were
to
be
taken
from
me
if
you
were
to
be
taken
from
me
and
she
stopped
unable
to
find
a
word
more
it
will
be
just
as
well
not
to
tell
me
dear
heart
he
said
to
her
gently
she
went
on
more
strenuously
yet
to
me
you
must
not
ever
ask
me
to
think
of
that
do
you
hear
me
for
oh
it
can
not
be
true
it
can
not
be
true
david
that
you
could
be
taken
from
me
forever
what
would
i
have
left
to
live
for
you
not
have
the
great
wonderful
god
asked
the
other
gently
god
who
made
me
and
all
that
was
lovable
in
me
and
made
you
and
would
demand
that
you
worship
him
but
helen
only
shook
her
head
once
more
and
answered
could
not
be
true
david
no
no
then
she
added
in
a
faint
voice
would
be
the
use
of
my
having
lived
the
man
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
again
and
kissed
away
a
little
of
the
frightened
anxious
look
upon
her
face
dear
he
said
with
a
gentle
smile
i
was
wrong
to
trouble
you
with
such
fearful
things
after
all
let
me
tell
you
instead
a
thought
that
once
came
to
my
mind
and
that
has
stayed
there
as
the
one
i
should
like
to
call
the
most
beautiful
of
all
my
life
it
may
help
to
answer
that
question
of
yours
about
the
use
of
having
lived
men
love
life
so
much
helen
dear
that
they
can
not
ever
have
enough
of
it
and
to
keep
it
and
build
it
up
they
make
what
we
call
the
arts
this
thought
of
mine
is
about
one
of
them
about
music
the
art
that
you
and
i
love
most
for
all
the
others
have
been
derived
from
things
external
but
music
was
made
out
of
nothing
and
exists
but
for
its
one
great
purpose
and
therefore
is
the
most
spiritual
of
all
of
them
i
like
to
say
that
it
is
time
made
beautiful
and
so
a
shadow
picture
of
the
soul
it
is
this
because
it
can
picture
different
degrees
of
speed
and
of
power
because
it
can
breathe
and
throb
can
sweep
and
soar
can
yearn
and
pray
because
in
short
everything
that
happens
in
the
heart
can
happen
in
music
so
that
we
may
lose
ourselves
in
it
and
actually
live
its
life
or
so
that
a
great
genius
can
not
merely
tell
us
about
himself
but
can
make
all
the
best
hours
of
his
soul
actually
a
part
of
our
own
this
thought
that
i
said
was
beautiful
came
to
me
from
noticing
how
perfectly
the
art
was
one
with
that
which
it
represented
so
that
we
may
say
not
only
that
music
is
life
but
that
life
is
music
music
exists
because
it
is
beautiful
dear
helen
and
because
it
brings
an
instant
of
the
joy
of
beauty
to
our
hearts
and
for
no
other
reason
whatever
it
may
be
music
of
happiness
or
of
sorrow
of
achievement
or
only
of
hope
but
so
long
as
it
is
beautiful
it
is
right
and
it
makes
no
difference
either
that
it
cost
much
labor
of
men
or
that
when
it
is
gone
it
is
gone
forever
and
dearest
suppose
that
the
music
not
only
was
beautiful
but
knew
that
it
was
beautiful
that
it
was
not
only
the
motion
of
the
air
but
also
the
joy
of
our
hearts
might
it
not
then
be
its
own
excuse
just
one
strain
of
it
that
rose
in
the
darkness
and
quivered
and
died
away
again
forever
when
david
had
spoken
thus
he
stopped
and
sat
still
for
a
while
gazing
at
his
wife
then
seeing
the
anxious
look
still
in
possession
of
her
face
he
rose
suddenly
by
way
of
ending
their
talk
he
said
smiling
is
wrong
of
me
perhaps
to
worry
you
about
such
very
fearful
things
as
those
let
us
go
in
and
find
something
to
do
that
is
useful
and
not
trouble
ourselves
with
them
any
chapter
ii
freude

it
was
late
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
that
helen
father
had
left
for
home
and
david
was
going
into
the
village
with
some
letters
to
mail
helen
was
not
feeling
very
well
herself
and
could
not
go
but
she
insisted
upon
his
going
for
she
watched
over
his
exercise
and
other
matters
of
health
with
scrupulous
care
she
had
wrapped
him
up
in
a
heavy
overcoat
and
was
kneeling
beside
his
chair
with
her
arms
about
him
me
dear
she
asked
him
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
you
sure
this
will
be
enough
to
keep
you
warm
for
the
nights
are
so
very
cold
you
know
i
do
not
like
you
to
come
back
alone
do
think
you
would
be
much
of
a
protection
against
danger
laughed
david
it
will
be
dark
when
you
get
back
will
only
be
about
dusk
was
the
reply
do
mind
helen
gazed
at
him
wistfully
for
a
minute
and
then
she
went
on
you
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
david
you
frightened
me
and
i
can
not
forget
what
you
said
each
time
that
it
comes
to
my
mind
it
makes
me
shudder
why
should
you
say
such
fearful
things
to
me
am
very
sorry
said
the
other
gently
simply
must
not
talk
to
me
so
cried
the
girl
you
do
you
will
make
me
so
that
i
can
not
bear
to
leave
you
for
an
instant
for
those
thoughts
make
my
love
for
you
simply
desperate
david
i
cry
out
to
myself
that
i
never
have
loved
you
enough
never
told
you
enough
and
then
she
added
pleadingly
oh
you
know
that
i
love
you
do
you
not
dear
tell
i
know
it
said
the
other
gently
taking
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
her
back
soon
helen
went
on
i
will
tell
you
once
more
how
much
i
do
and
then
we
can
be
happy
again
and
i
wo
be
afraid
any
more
please
let
me
be
happy
wo
you
david
love
i
will
said
the
man
with
a
smile
do
not
think
that
i
was
wise
ever
to
trouble
helen
was
silent
for
a
while
then
as
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
her
she
added
i
meant
to
tell
you
something
do
you
know
if
those
horrible
thoughts
keep
haunting
me
it
is
just
this
that
they
will
make
me
do
you
said
that
god
was
very
good
and
so
i
was
thinking
that
i
would
show
him
how
very
much
i
love
you
how
i
could
really
never
get
along
without
you
and
how
i
care
for
nothing
else
in
the
world
it
seems
to
me
to
be
such
a
little
thing
that
we
should
only
just
want
to
love
and
truly
that
is
all
i
do
want
i
would
not
mind
anything
else
in
the
world
i
would
go
away
from
this
little
house
and
live
in
any
poor
place
and
do
all
the
work
and
never
care
about
anything
else
at
all
if
i
just
might
have
you
that
is
really
true
david
and
i
wish
that
you
would
know
it
and
that
god
would
know
it
and
not
expect
me
to
think
of
such
dreadful
things
as
you
talk
as
david
gazed
into
her
deep
earnest
eyes
he
pressed
her
to
him
with
a
sudden
burst
of
emotion
have
me
now
dearest
he
whispered
oh
i
shall
trust
the
god
who
gave
me
this
precious
heart
he
kissed
her
once
more
in
fervent
love
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
until
the
clouds
had
left
her
face
she
leaned
back
and
gazed
at
him
and
was
radiant
with
delight
again
oh
oh
she
cried
it
only
makes
me
more
full
of
wonder
at
the
real
truth
for
it
is
the
truth
david
it
is
the
truth
that
you
are
all
mine
it
is
so
wonderful
and
it
makes
me
so
happy
i
seem
to
lose
myself
more
in
the
thought
every
day
can
never
lose
yourself
too
much
little
sweetheart
david
whispered
us
trust
to
love
and
let
it
grow
all
that
it
will
helen
i
never
knew
what
it
was
to
live
until
i
met
you
never
knew
how
life
could
be
so
full
and
rich
and
happy
and
never
never
will
i
be
able
to
tell
you
how
much
i
love
you
dearest
but
i
believe
you
without
being
told
she
said
laughing
you
know
i
could
make
myself
quite
mad
just
with
saying
over
to
myself
that
you
love
me
all
that
i
could
ever
wish
you
to
love
me
all
that
i
could
imagine
you
loving
me
is
that
true
david
that
is
true
the
man
replied
you
do
know
what
a
wonderful
imagination
i
have
laughed
the
girl
how
hungry
for
your
love
i
and
she
clasped
him
to
her
passionately
and
cried
you
can
make
me
too
happy
to
live
with
that
thought
i
shall
have
to
think
about
it
all
the
time
that
you
are
gone
and
when
you
come
back
i
shall
be
so
wonderfully
excited
oh
oh
david
then
she
laughed
eagerly
and
sprang
up
must
not
stay
any
longer
she
exclaimed
it
is
getting
late
only
hurry
back
because
i
can
do
nothing
but
wait
for
and
so
she
led
him
to
the
door
and
kissed
him
again
and
then
watched
him
as
he
started
up
the
road
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
as
she
leaned
against
the
railing
of
the
porch
with
the
glory
of
the
sunset
falling
upon
her
hair
she
made
a
radiant
picture
for
her
cheeks
were
still
flushed
and
her
bosom
still
heaving
with
the
glory
of
the
thought
she
had
promised
to
keep
there
was
so
much
of
her
love
in
the
look
which
she
kept
upon
david
that
it
took
some
resolution
to
go
on
and
leave
her
as
for
helen
she
watched
him
until
he
had
quite
disappeared
in
the
forest
after
which
she
turned
and
gazed
across
the
lake
at
the
gold
and
crimson
mountains
but
all
the
time
she
was
still
thinking
the
thought
of
david
love
the
wonder
of
it
was
still
upon
her
face
and
it
seemed
to
lift
her
form
until
at
last
she
stretched
wide
her
arms
and
leaned
back
her
head
and
drank
a
deep
draft
of
the
evening
air
whispering
aloud
i
do
not
dare
to
be
as
happy
as
i
can
and
she
clasped
her
arms
upon
her
bosom
and
laughed
a
wild
laugh
of
joy
later
on
because
it
was
cold
she
turned
and
went
into
the
house
singing
a
song
to
herself
as
she
moved
as
she
went
to
the
piano
and
sat
down
she
saw
upon
the
rack
the
little
springtime
song
of
that
was
the
first
thing
she
had
ever
heard
upon
david
violin
she
played
a
few
bars
of
it
to
herself
and
then
she
stopped
and
sat
still
lost
in
the
memory
which
it
brought
to
her
mind
of
the
night
when
she
had
sat
at
the
window
and
listened
to
it
just
after
seeing
arthur
for
the
last
time
to
think
that
it
was
only
four
or
five
months
ago
she
whispered
to
herself
how
wretched
i
was
do
not
believe
i
could
ever
be
so
unhappy
again
she
went
on
after
a
while
know
that
i
could
not
while
i
have
david
after
which
her
thoughts
came
back
into
the
old
old
course
of
joy
when
she
looked
at
the
music
again
the
memory
of
her
grief
was
gone
and
she
read
in
it
all
of
her
own
she
played
it
through
again
and
afterwards
sat
quite
still
until
the
twilight
had
begun
to
gather
in
the
room
helen
then
rose
and
lit
the
lamp
and
the
fire
in
the
open
she
glanced
at
the
clock
and
saw
that
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
and
she
said
to
herself
that
it
could
not
be
more
than
that
time
again
before
david
was
back
should
go
out
and
meet
him
if
i
were
feeling
quite
strong
she
added
as
she
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
then
she
exclaimed
suddenly
oh
i
know
how
i
can
please
him
better
and
the
girl
went
to
the
table
where
some
of
her
books
were
lying
and
sat
down
and
began
very
diligently
studying
glancing
every
half
minute
at
the
clock
and
at
the
door
shall
be
too
busy
even
to
hear
him
she
said
with
a
sudden
burst
of
glee
and
quite
delighted
with
the
effect
that
would
produce
she
listened
eagerly
every
time
she
fancied
she
heard
a
step
and
then
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
book
and
put
on
a
look
of
most
complete
absorption
unfortunately
for
helen
plan
however
each
time
it
proved
to
be
a
false
alarm
and
so
the
fifteen
minutes
passed
completely
and
then
five
and
five
again
the
girl
had
quite
given
up
studying
by
that
time
and
was
gazing
at
the
clock
and
listening
to
its
ticking
and
wondering
very
much
indeed
at
last
when
more
than
of
an
hour
had
passed
since
david
had
left
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
once
more
to
listen
as
she
did
not
hear
anything
she
went
out
on
the
piazza
and
finally
to
the
road
all
about
her
was
veiled
in
shadow
which
her
eyes
strove
in
vain
to
pierce
and
so
growing
still
more
impatient
she
raised
her
voice
and
called
david
and
then
stood
and
listened
to
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
the
faint
lapping
of
the
water
on
the
shore
is
very
strange
helen
thought
growing
very
anxious
indeed
is
fearfully
strange
what
in
the
world
can
have
happened
and
she
called
again
with
no
more
result
that
before
until
with
a
sudden
resolution
she
turned
and
passed
quickly
into
the
house
and
flinging
a
wrap
about
her
came
out
and
started
down
the
road
occasionally
she
raised
her
voice
and
shouted
david
name
but
still
she
got
no
reply
and
her
anxiety
soon
changed
into
alarm
and
she
was
hurrying
along
almost
in
a
run
in
this
way
she
climbed
the
long
ascent
which
the
road
made
from
the
lake
shore
and
when
she
had
reached
the
top
of
it
she
gathered
her
breath
and
shouted
once
more
louder
and
more
excitedly
than
ever
this
time
she
heard
the
expected
reply
and
found
that
david
was
only
a
few
rods
ahead
of
her
is
the
matter
she
called
to
him
and
as
he
answered
that
it
was
nothing
but
to
come
to
him
she
ran
on
more
alarmed
than
ever
there
was
just
light
enough
for
her
to
see
that
david
was
bending
down
and
then
as
she
got
very
near
she
saw
that
on
the
ground
in
front
of
him
was
lying
a
dark
shadowy
form
as
helen
cried
out
again
to
know
what
was
the
matter
her
husband
said
not
be
frightened
dear
it
is
only
some
poor
woman
that
i
have
found
here
by
the
woman
the
girl
echoed
in
wonder
at
the
same
time
giving
a
gasp
of
relief
at
the
discovery
that
her
husband
was
not
in
trouble
in
the
world
can
she
have
come
from
david
do
not
know
he
answered
she
probably
wandered
off
the
main
road
it
is
some
poor
wretched
creature
helen
she
has
been
drinking
and
is
quite
and
helen
stood
still
in
horror
while
david
arose
and
came
to
her
are
out
of
breath
dear
he
exclaimed
did
you
come
so
fast
i
was
so
frightened
the
girl
panted
can
not
tell
you
david
what
happens
in
my
heart
whenever
i
think
of
your
coming
to
any
harm
it
was
dreadful
for
i
knew
something
serious
must
be
the
david
put
his
arm
about
her
and
kissed
her
to
quiet
her
fears
then
he
said
ought
not
to
have
come
out
dear
but
be
calm
now
for
there
is
nothing
to
worry
you
only
we
must
take
care
of
this
poor
woman
it
is
such
a
sad
sight
helen
i
wish
that
you
had
not
come
were
you
going
to
do
asked
the
girl
forgetting
herself
quickly
in
her
sympathy
meant
to
come
down
and
tell
you
was
david
reply
then
go
back
to
town
and
get
someone
to
come
and
take
her
david
you
can
never
get
back
over
that
rough
road
in
the
darkness
exclaimed
helen
in
alarm
is
too
far
for
you
to
walk
even
in
the
daytime
i
will
not
let
you
do
it
you
must
not
dear
this
poor
creature
can
not
be
left
here
it
will
be
a
bitter
cold
night
and
she
might
helen
was
silent
for
a
moment
in
thought
and
then
she
said
in
a
low
trembling
voice
there
is
only
one
thing
to
is
that
dear
asked
the
other
will
have
to
take
her
home
with
you
know
what
you
are
saying
asked
the
other
with
a
start
would
be
a
fearful
thing
to
do
can
not
help
it
she
replied
is
the
only
thing
and
it
would
be
wicked
not
to
be
willing
to
do
that
because
she
is
a
is
in
a
fearful
way
dear
said
the
other
hesitatingly
to
ask
you
to
take
care
of
her
would
do
anything
sooner
than
let
you
take
that
walk
in
such
darkness
as
this
was
the
girl
reply
and
with
that
statement
she
silenced
all
of
his
objections
and
so
at
last
david
pressed
her
hand
and
whispered
well
dear
god
will
bless
you
for
then
for
a
while
the
two
stood
in
silence
until
helen
asked
you
think
that
we
can
carry
her
poor
creature
may
try
it
the
other
replied
and
helen
went
and
knelt
by
the
prostrate
figure
the
woman
was
muttering
to
herself
but
she
seemed
to
be
quite
dazed
and
not
to
know
what
was
going
on
about
her
helen
did
not
hesitate
any
longer
but
bent
over
and
strove
to
lift
her
the
woman
was
fortunately
of
a
slight
build
and
seemed
to
be
very
thin
so
that
with
david
help
it
was
easy
to
raise
her
to
her
feet
it
was
a
fearful
task
none
the
less
for
the
poor
wretch
was
foul
with
the
mud
in
which
she
had
been
lying
and
her
wet
hair
was
streaming
over
her
shoulders
as
helen
strove
to
lift
her
up
the
head
sunk
over
upon
her
but
the
girl
bit
her
lips
together
grimly
she
put
her
arm
about
the
woman
waist
and
david
did
the
same
on
the
other
side
and
so
the
three
started
stumbling
slowly
along
in
the
darkness
you
sure
that
it
is
not
too
much
for
you
david
asked
can
stop
whenever
you
like
let
us
go
on
the
girl
said
has
almost
no
weight
and
we
must
not
leave
her
out
here
in
the
cold
her
hands
are
almost
frozen
they
soon
made
their
way
on
down
to
where
the
lights
of
the
little
cottage
shone
through
the
trees
david
could
not
but
shrink
back
as
he
thought
of
taking
their
wretched
burden
into
their
little
home
but
he
heard
the
woman
groan
feebly
and
he
was
ashamed
of
his
thought
nothing
more
was
said
until
they
had
climbed
the
steps
not
without
difficulty
and
had
deposited
their
burden
upon
the
floor
of
the
sitting
room
after
which
david
rose
and
sank
back
into
a
chair
for
the
strain
had
been
a
heavy
one
for
him
helen
also
sprang
up
as
she
gazed
at
the
figure
the
woman
was
foul
with
every
misery
that
disease
and
sin
can
bring
upon
a
human
creature
her
clothing
torn
to
shreds
and
her
face
swollen
and
stained
she
was
half
delirious
and
clawing
about
her
with
her
shrunken
quivering
hands
so
that
helen
exclaimed
in
horror
god
that
is
the
most
dreadful
sight
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
away
said
the
other
raising
himself
from
the
chair
is
not
right
that
you
should
look
at
such
but
with
helen
it
was
only
a
moment
before
her
pity
had
overcome
every
other
emotion
she
knelt
down
by
the
stranger
and
took
one
of
the
cold
hands
and
began
chafing
it
poor
woman
she
exclaimed
what
misery
you
must
have
suffered
david
what
can
a
woman
do
to
be
punished
like
this
it
is
fearful
it
was
a
strange
picture
which
the
two
made
at
that
moment
the
woman
in
her
cruel
misery
and
the
girl
in
her
pure
and
noble
beauty
but
helen
had
no
more
thought
of
shrinking
for
all
her
soul
had
gone
out
to
the
unfortunate
stranger
and
she
kept
on
trying
to
bring
her
back
to
consciousness
david
she
said
can
we
do
to
help
her
it
is
too
much
that
any
human
being
should
be
like
this
she
would
have
died
if
we
had
not
found
and
then
as
the
other
opened
her
eyes
and
struggled
to
lift
herself
helen
caught
an
incoherent
word
and
said
think
she
is
thirsty
david
get
some
water
and
perhaps
that
will
help
her
we
must
find
some
way
to
comfort
her
for
this
is
too
horrible
to
be
and
perhaps
it
is
not
her
fault
you
know
who
knows
but
perhaps
some
man
may
have
been
the
cause
of
it
all
is
it
not
dreadful
to
think
of
david
so
the
girl
went
on
her
back
was
turned
to
her
husband
and
she
was
engrossed
in
her
task
of
mercy
and
did
not
see
what
he
was
doing
she
did
not
see
that
he
had
started
forward
in
his
chair
and
was
staring
at
the
woman
she
did
not
see
him
leaning
forward
farther
and
farther
with
a
strange
look
upon
his
face
but
there
was
something
she
did
see
at
last
as
the
woman
lifted
herself
again
and
stared
first
at
helen
own
pitying
face
and
then
vaguely
about
the
room
and
last
of
all
gazing
at
david
suddenly
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
and
strove
to
rise
with
a
wild
cry
that
made
helen
leap
back
in
consternation
it
david
and
at
the
same
instant
david
sprang
up
with
what
was
almost
a
scream
of
horror
he
reeled
and
staggered
backwards
against
the
wall
clutching
with
his
hands
at
his
forehead
his
face
a
ghastly
ashen
gray
and
as
helen
sprang
up
and
ran
towards
him
he
sank
down
upon
his
knees
with
a
moan
gazing
up
into
the
air
with
a
look
of
agony
upon
his
face
god
my
god
he
gasped
is
my
mary
and
helen
sank
down
beside
him
clutching
him
by
the
arm
and
staring
at
him
in
terror
david
she
whispered
in
a
hoarse
voice
but
the
man
seemed
not
to
hear
her
so
overwhelmed
was
he
by
his
own
emotion
is
mary
he
cried
out
again
is
my
mary
oh
god
have
mercy
upon
my
soul
and
then
a
shudder
passed
over
him
and
he
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
and
fell
down
upon
the
floor
with
helen
almost
paralyzed
with
fright
still
clinging
to
him
in
the
meantime
the
woman
had
still
been
stretching
out
her
trembling
arms
to
him
crying
his
name
again
and
again
as
she
sank
back
exhausted
the
man
started
up
and
rushed
toward
her
clutching
her
by
the
hand
and
exclaiming
frantically
mary
it
is
i
speak
to
me
but
the
other
delirium
seemed
to
have
returned
and
she
only
stared
at
him
blankly
at
last
david
staggered
to
his
feet
and
began
pacing
wildly
up
and
down
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
and
crying
helplessly
god
that
this
should
come
to
me
now
oh
how
can
i
bear
it
oh
mary
mary
he
sank
down
upon
the
sofa
again
and
burst
into
fearful
sobbing
helen
who
had
still
been
kneeling
where
he
left
her
rushed
toward
him
and
flung
her
arms
about
him
crying
out
david
what
is
the
matter
david
you
will
kill
me
what
is
it
and
he
started
and
stared
at
her
wildly
clutching
her
arm
he
gasped
to
me
i
ruined
that
woman
do
you
hear
me
do
you
hear
me
it
was
i
who
betrayed
her
i
who
made
her
what
she
is
i
oh
leave
me
leave
me
alone
oh
what
can
i
do
then
as
the
girl
still
clung
to
him
sobbing
his
name
in
terror
the
man
went
on
half
beside
himself
with
his
grief
think
of
it
oh
how
can
i
bear
to
know
it
and
live
years
ago
and
it
comes
back
to
curse
me
now
and
all
these
years
i
have
been
living
and
forgetting
it
and
been
happy
and
talking
of
my
goodness
oh
god
and
this
fearful
madness
upon
the
earth
and
i
made
it
i
and
has
had
to
pay
for
it
oh
look
at
her
helen
look
at
her
think
that
that
foulness
is
mine
she
was
beautiful
she
was
pure
and
she
might
have
been
happy
she
would
have
been
good
but
for
me
oh
god
in
heaven
where
can
i
hide
myself
what
can
i
do
helen
was
still
clutching
at
his
arm
crying
to
him
spare
me
he
flung
her
off
in
a
mad
frenzy
holding
her
at
arm
length
and
staring
at
her
with
a
fearful
light
in
his
eyes
girl
he
cried
you
know
who
i
am
do
you
know
what
i
have
done
this
girl
was
like
you
once
and
i
made
her
love
me
made
her
love
me
with
the
sacred
fire
that
god
had
given
me
made
her
love
me
as
i
made
love
me
and
she
was
beautiful
like
you
she
was
younger
than
you
and
as
happy
as
you
and
she
trusted
me
as
you
trusted
me
she
gave
herself
to
me
as
you
did
and
i
took
her
and
promised
her
my
love
and
now
look
at
her
can
you
wish
to
be
near
me
can
you
wish
to
see
me
oh
helen
i
can
not
bear
myself
oh
leave
me
i
must
die
he
sank
down
once
more
weeping
all
his
form
shaking
with
his
grief
helen
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
again
but
the
man
seemed
to
forget
her
presence
think
where
that
woman
has
been
he
moaned
what
she
has
seen
and
done
and
suffered
and
what
she
is
was
there
ever
such
a
wreck
of
womanhood
ever
such
a
curse
upon
earth
and
oh
for
the
years
that
she
has
lived
in
her
fearful
sin
and
i
have
been
happy
great
god
what
can
i
do
for
those
years
how
can
i
live
and
gaze
upon
this
crime
of
mine
i
who
sought
for
beauty
to
have
made
this
madness
and
it
comes
now
to
curse
me
now
when
it
is
too
late
when
the
life
is
wrecked
when
it
is
gone
forever
david
voice
had
sunk
into
a
moan
and
then
suddenly
he
heard
the
woman
crying
out
and
he
staggered
to
his
feet
she
was
sitting
up
again
her
arms
stretched
out
david
caught
her
in
his
own
gazing
into
her
face
and
crying
mary
look
at
me
here
i
am
i
am
david
the
david
you
he
stopped
gasping
for
breath
and
the
woman
cried
in
a
faint
voice
water
david
turned
and
called
to
helen
and
the
poor
girl
tho
scarcely
able
to
stand
ran
to
get
a
glass
of
it
another
thought
came
to
the
man
in
the
meantime
and
he
turned
to
the
other
with
a
sudden
cry
there
were
a
child
he
gasped
child
of
mine
somewhere
in
the
world
alone
and
helpless
he
stared
into
the
woman
eyes
imploringly
she
was
gazing
at
him
choking
and
trying
to
speak
she
seemed
to
be
making
an
effort
to
understand
him
and
as
david
repeated
his
agonizing
question
she
gave
a
sign
of
assent
causing
a
still
wilder
look
to
cross
the
man
face
he
called
to
her
again
to
tell
him
where
but
the
woman
seemed
to
be
sinking
back
into
her
raving
and
she
only
gasped
faintly
again
for
water
when
helen
brought
it
they
poured
it
down
her
throat
and
then
david
repeated
his
question
once
more
but
he
gave
a
groan
as
he
saw
that
it
was
all
in
vain
the
wild
raving
had
begun
again
and
the
woman
only
stared
at
him
blankly
until
at
last
the
wretched
man
quite
overcome
sank
down
at
her
side
and
buried
his
head
upon
her
shrunken
bosom
and
cried
like
a
child
poor
helen
in
the
meantime
clinging
to
him
still
it
was
only
when
david
had
quite
worn
himself
out
that
he
seemed
to
hear
her
pleading
voice
then
he
looked
at
her
and
for
the
first
time
through
his
own
grief
caught
sight
of
hers
there
was
such
a
look
of
helpless
woe
upon
helen
face
that
he
put
out
his
hand
to
her
and
whispered
faintly
poor
little
girl
what
have
done
that
you
should
suffer
so
as
helen
drew
closer
to
him
clinging
to
his
hand
in
fright
he
went
on
you
ever
forgive
me
for
this
horror
forgive
me
that
i
dared
to
forget
it
that
i
dared
to
marry
you
the
girl
answer
was
a
faint
moan
david
have
mercy
on
me
he
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
reading
still
more
of
her
suffering
he
asked
see
what
has
come
upon
me
can
you
ask
me
not
to
be
wretched
can
you
ask
me
still
to
live
what
can
i
do
for
such
a
crime
when
i
look
at
this
wreck
of
a
soul
what
comfort
can
i
hope
to
find
and
the
girl
her
heart
bursting
with
grief
could
only
clasp
his
hands
in
hers
and
gaze
into
his
eyes
there
was
no
word
she
could
think
of
to
say
to
him
and
so
for
a
long
time
the
two
remained
in
silence
david
again
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
woman
who
seemed
to
be
sinking
into
a
kind
of
stupor
when
he
looked
up
once
more
it
was
because
helen
was
whispering
in
his
ear
a
new
thought
having
come
to
her
perhaps
might
be
able
to
help
you
the
man
replied
in
a
faint
gasping
voice
me
how
and
the
girl
answered
with
me
and
rose
weakly
to
her
feet
half
lifting
him
also
he
gazed
at
the
woman
and
saw
that
she
was
lying
still
and
then
he
did
as
helen
asked
she
led
him
gently
into
the
other
room
away
from
the
fearful
sight
and
the
two
sat
down
david
limp
and
helpless
so
that
he
could
only
sink
down
in
her
arms
with
a
groan
poor
david
she
whispered
in
a
voice
of
infinite
pity
my
poor
david
you
do
not
scorn
me
helen
the
man
asked
in
a
faint
trembling
voice
and
went
on
pleading
with
her
in
words
so
abject
and
so
wretched
that
they
wrung
the
girl
heart
more
than
ever
how
can
you
speak
to
me
so
she
cried
who
are
all
my
life
and
then
she
added
with
swift
intensity
to
me
david
it
can
not
be
so
bad
as
that
i
know
it
will
you
not
tell
me
david
tell
me
all
so
that
i
may
help
you
so
she
went
on
pleading
with
him
gently
until
at
last
the
man
spoke
again
in
faltering
words
he
said
was
only
a
boy
god
knows
that
is
one
excuse
if
it
is
the
only
one
i
was
only
seventeen
and
she
was
no
was
she
david
the
girl
asked
lived
in
a
village
across
the
mountains
from
here
near
where
our
home
used
to
be
she
was
a
farmer
daughter
and
she
was
beautiful
oh
to
think
that
that
woman
was
once
a
beautiful
girl
and
innocent
and
pure
but
we
were
young
we
loved
each
other
and
we
had
no
one
to
warn
us
it
was
so
long
ago
that
it
seems
like
a
dream
to
me
now
but
we
sinned
and
i
took
her
for
mine
then
i
went
home
to
tell
my
father
to
tell
him
that
she
was
my
wife
and
that
i
must
marry
her
and
oh
god
she
was
a
farmer
daughter
and
i
was
a
rich
man
son
and
the
cursed
world
knows
nothing
of
human
souls
and
i
must
not
marry
her
i
found
all
the
world
in
arms
against
it
you
let
yourself
be
persuaded
asked
the
girl
in
a
faint
whisper
echoed
david
his
voice
shaking
would
have
thought
of
persuading
a
mad
boy
i
let
myself
be
commanded
and
frightened
into
submission
and
carried
away
and
then
five
or
six
miserable
months
passed
away
and
i
got
a
letter
from
her
and
she
was
with
child
and
she
was
ruined
forever
she
prayed
to
me
in
words
that
have
haunted
me
night
and
day
all
my
life
to
come
to
her
and
keep
my
and
david
stopped
and
gave
a
groan
the
other
whispered
could
not
go
went
he
answered
borrowed
money
begged
it
from
one
of
my
father
servants
and
ran
away
and
went
up
there
and
oh
i
was
two
days
too
late
late
exclaimed
helen
wonderingly
yes
was
the
hoarse
reply
she
was
a
weak
and
helpless
girl
and
scorned
of
all
the
world
and
her
parents
had
turned
her
away
and
she
was
gone
no
one
knew
where
helen
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
never
seen
her
nor
ever
heard
of
her
and
now
she
comes
to
curse
me
to
curse
my
soul
forever
and
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
more
than
i
can
bear
david
sank
down
again
crying
out
is
too
much
it
is
too
much
but
then
suddenly
he
caught
his
wife
hand
in
his
and
stared
up
at
her
exclaiming
she
said
there
was
a
child
helen
somewhere
in
the
world
there
is
another
soul
suffering
for
this
sin
of
mine
oh
somehow
we
must
find
out
about
that
something
must
be
done
i
could
not
have
two
such
fearful
things
to
know
of
we
must
find
out
we
must
find
out
as
the
man
stopped
and
stared
wildly
about
him
he
heard
the
voice
again
and
sprang
up
but
helen
terrified
at
his
suffering
caught
him
by
the
arm
whispering
no
david
let
me
go
in
i
can
take
care
of
and
she
forced
her
husband
down
on
the
sofa
once
more
and
then
ran
into
the
next
room
she
found
the
woman
again
struggling
to
raise
herself
upon
her
trembling
arms
staring
about
her
and
calling
out
incoherently
helen
rushed
to
her
and
took
her
hands
in
hers
trying
to
soothe
her
again
but
the
woman
staggered
to
her
feet
oblivious
of
everything
about
her
is
he
where
is
he
she
gasped
hoarsely
will
come
back
she
began
calling
david
name
and
a
moment
later
as
helen
tried
to
keep
her
quiet
she
tore
her
hands
loose
and
rushed
blindly
across
the
room
shrieking
louder
yet
where
are
you
you
know
me
david
as
helen
turned
she
saw
that
her
husband
had
heard
the
cries
and
come
to
the
doorway
again
but
it
was
all
in
vain
for
the
woman
though
she
looked
at
him
knew
him
no
more
it
was
to
a
phantom
of
her
own
brain
that
she
was
calling
in
the
meantime
pacing
up
and
down
her
voice
rising
higher
and
higher
she
was
reeling
this
way
and
that
and
helen
frightened
at
her
violence
strove
to
restrain
her
only
to
be
flung
off
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
the
woman
rushed
on
groping
about
her
blindly
and
crying
still
tell
me
where
is
david
then
as
david
and
helen
stood
watching
her
in
helpless
misery
her
delirious
mood
changed
and
she
clutched
her
hands
over
her
bosom
and
shuddered
and
moaned
to
herself
is
cold
oh
it
is
cold
afterwards
she
burst
into
frantic
sobbing
that
choked
her
and
shook
all
her
frame
and
again
into
wild
peals
of
laughter
and
then
last
of
all
she
stopped
and
sprang
back
staring
in
front
of
her
with
her
whole
face
a
picture
of
agonizing
fright
she
gave
one
wild
scream
after
another
and
staggered
and
sank
down
at
last
upon
the
floor
it
is
he
it
is
he
she
cried
her
voice
sinking
into
a
shudder
spare
me
why
should
you
beat
me
oh
god
have
mercy
have
mercy
her
cries
rose
again
into
a
shriek
that
made
helen
blood
run
cold
she
looked
in
terror
at
her
husband
and
saw
that
his
face
was
white
in
the
meantime
the
wretched
woman
had
flung
herself
down
prostrate
upon
the
floor
where
she
lay
groveling
and
writhing
that
again
however
was
only
for
a
minute
or
two
she
staggered
up
once
more
and
rushed
blindly
across
the
room
crying
can
not
bear
it
i
can
not
bear
it
oh
what
have
i
done
then
suddenly
as
she
flung
up
her
arms
imploringly
and
staggered
blindly
on
she
lurched
forward
and
fell
striking
her
head
against
the
corner
of
the
table
helen
started
forward
with
a
cry
of
alarm
but
before
she
had
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
the
woman
had
raised
herself
to
her
feet
once
more
and
was
staring
at
her
blinded
by
the
blood
which
poured
from
a
cut
in
her
forehead
her
clothing
was
torn
half
from
her
and
her
tangled
hair
streamed
from
her
shoulders
she
was
a
ghastly
sight
to
behold
as
delirious
with
terror
she
began
once
more
rushing
this
way
and
that
about
the
room
the
two
who
watched
her
were
powerless
to
help
her
and
could
only
drink
in
the
horror
of
it
all
and
shudder
as
with
each
minute
the
poor
creature
became
more
frantic
and
more
desperate
all
the
while
it
was
evident
that
her
strength
was
fast
leaving
her
she
staggered
more
and
more
and
at
last
she
sank
down
upon
her
knees
she
strove
to
rise
again
and
found
that
she
could
not
but
lurched
and
fell
upon
the
floor
as
she
turned
over
and
helen
saw
her
face
the
sight
was
too
much
for
the
and
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
broke
into
frantic
sobbing
david
in
the
meantime
was
crouching
in
the
doorway
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
woman
he
did
not
seem
even
to
notice
helen
outburst
so
lost
was
all
his
soul
in
the
other
sight
fie
saw
that
the
stranger
convulsive
efforts
were
weakening
and
he
staggered
forward
with
a
cry
and
flung
himself
forward
down
on
his
knees
beside
her
mary
he
called
but
she
did
not
heed
him
tho
he
clasped
her
hands
and
shook
her
gazing
into
her
face
imploringly
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
but
it
was
with
a
vacant
stare
and
then
suddenly
he
started
back
with
a
cry
of
horror
god
she
is
dying
the
woman
made
a
sudden
fearful
effort
to
lift
herself
struggling
and
gasping
her
face
distorted
with
fierce
agony
as
it
failed
she
sank
back
and
lay
panting
hard
for
breath
then
a
shudder
passed
over
her
and
while
david
still
stared
transfixed
a
hoarse
rattle
came
from
her
throat
and
her
features
became
suddenly
set
in
their
dreadful
passion
in
a
moment
more
all
was
still
and
david
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
sank
down
upon
the
corpse
without
even
a
moan
afterwards
for
a
full
minute
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
room
helen
sobbing
had
ceased
she
had
looked
up
and
sat
staring
at
the
two
figures
until
at
last
with
a
sudden
start
of
fright
she
sprang
up
and
crept
silently
toward
them
she
glanced
once
at
the
woman
body
and
then
bent
over
david
as
she
felt
that
his
heart
was
still
beating
she
caught
him
to
her
bosom
and
knelt
thus
in
terror
staring
first
into
his
white
and
tortured
features
and
then
at
the
body
on
the
floor
finally
however
she
nerved
herself
and
tho
she
was
trembling
and
exhausted
staggered
to
her
feet
with
her
burden
holding
it
tightly
in
her
arms
she
went
step
by
step
slowly
and
in
silence
out
of
the
room
when
she
had
passed
into
the
next
one
she
shut
the
door
and
sinking
down
upon
the
sofa
lifted
david
broken
figure
beside
her
and
locked
it
in
her
arms
and
was
still
thus
she
sat
without
a
sound
or
a
motion
her
heart
within
her
torn
with
fear
and
pain
all
through
the
long
hours
of
that
night
when
the
cold
white
dawn
came
up
she
was
still
pressing
him
to
her
bosom
sobbing
and
whispering
faintly
david
oh
my
poor
poor
david
hast
du
im
venusburg
geweilt
so
bist
nun

du
verdammt
chapter
iii
said
i
is
me
for
i
am
undone
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
king
the
lord
of
hosts
david
servant
drove
out
early
upon
the
following
morning
to
tell
him
of
a
strange
woman
who
had
been
asking
for
him
in
the
village
they
sent
the
man
back
for
a
doctor
and
it
was
found
that
the
poor
creature
was
really
dead
they
wished
to
take
the
body
away
but
david
would
not
have
it
and
so
late
in
the
afternoon
a
grave
was
dug
by
the
near
the
little
cottage
and
what
was
left
of
mary
was
buried
there
david
was
too
exhausted
to
leave
the
house
and
helen
would
not
stir
from
his
side
so
the
two
sat
in
silence
until
the
ceremony
was
over
and
the
men
had
gone
the
servant
went
with
them
because
the
girl
said
they
wished
to
be
alone
and
then
the
house
settled
down
to
its
usual
quietness
a
quietness
that
frightened
helen
now
for
when
she
looked
at
her
husband
her
heart
scarcely
beat
for
her
terror
he
was
ghastly
white
and
his
lips
were
trembling
and
though
he
had
not
shed
a
tear
all
the
day
there
was
a
look
of
mournful
despair
on
his
face
that
told
more
fearfully
than
any
words
how
utterly
the
soul
within
him
was
beaten
and
crushed
all
that
day
he
had
been
so
and
as
helen
remembered
the
man
that
had
been
before
so
strong
and
eager
and
brare
her
whole
soul
stood
still
with
awe
yet
as
before
she
could
do
nothing
but
cling
to
him
and
gaze
at
him
with
bursting
heart
but
at
last
when
the
hours
had
passed
and
not
a
move
had
been
made
she
asked
him
faintly
is
there
no
hope
is
it
to
be
like
this
always
the
man
raised
his
eyes
and
gazed
at
her
helplessly
he
said
his
voice
sounding
hollow
and
strange
can
you
ask
of
me
how
can
i
bear
to
look
about
me
again
how
can
i
think
of
living
oh
that
night
of
horror
helen
it
burns
my
brain
it
tortures
my
soul
it
will
drive
me
mad
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
again
shaking
with
emotion
i
can
not
ever
forget
it
he
whispered
hoarsely
must
haunt
me
haunt
me
until
i
die
i
must
know
that
after
all
my
years
of
struggle
it
was
this
that
i
made
it
is
this
that
stands
for
my
life
and
it
is
over
and
gone
from
me
forever
and
finished
oh
god
was
there
ever
such
a
horror
flashed
upon
a
guilty
soul
ever
such
fiendish
torture
for
a
man
to
bear
and
helen
there
was
a
child
too
think
how
that
thought
must
goad
me
a
child
of
mine
and
i
can
not
ever
aid
it
it
must
suffer
for
its
mother
shame
and
think
if
it
were
a
woman
helen
this
madness
must
go
on
and
go
on
forever
oh
where
am
i
to
hide
me
and
what
can
i
do
there
came
no
tears
but
only
a
fearful
sobbing
poor
helen
whispered
frantically
it
was
not
your
fault
you
could
not
help
it
surely
you
can
not
be
to
blame
for
all
he
did
not
answer
her
but
after
a
long
silence
he
went
on
in
a
deep
low
voice
she
was
so
beautiful
she
has
lived
in
my
thoughts
all
these
years
as
the
figure
that
i
used
to
see
so
bright
and
so
happy
i
used
to
hear
her
singing
in
church
and
the
music
was
a
kind
of
madness
to
me
because
i
knew
that
she
loved
me
and
her
home
was
a
little
half
buried
in
great
trees
and
i
used
to
see
her
there
with
her
flowers
now
oh
think
of
her
now
think
of
her
life
of
shame
and
agony
think
of
her
turned
away
from
her
home
and
from
all
she
loved
in
the
world
deserted
and
scorned
and
helpless
think
of
her
with
child
and
of
the
agony
of
her
degradation
what
must
she
not
have
suffered
to
be
as
she
was
last
night
oh
are
there
tears
enough
in
the
world
to
pay
for
such
a
curse
for
that
twenty
years
burden
of
wretchedness
and
sin
and
she
was
beaten
oh
she
was
beaten
mary
my
poor
poor
mary
and
to
die
in
such
horror
in
drunkenness
and
madness
and
now
she
is
gone
and
it
is
over
and
oh
why
should
i
live
what
can
i
do
his
voice
dropped
into
a
moan
and
then
again
there
was
a
long
silence
at
last
helen
whispered
in
a
weak
trembling
voice
you
have
still
love
can
that
be
nothing
to
you
have
no
right
to
love
he
groaned
right
to
love
and
i
never
had
any
for
oh
all
my
life
this
vision
has
haunted
me
i
knew
that
nothing
but
death
could
have
saved
her
from
shame
yes
and
i
knew
too
that
some
day
i
must
find
her
i
have
carried
the
terror
of
that
in
my
heart
all
these
years
yet
i
dared
to
take
your
love
and
dared
to
fly
from
my
sin
and
then
there
comes
this
thunderbolt
oh
merciful
heaven
it
is
too
much
to
bear
too
much
to
bear
he
sank
down
again
poor
helen
could
find
no
word
of
comfort
no
utterance
of
her
own
bursting
heart
except
the
same
frantic
clasp
of
her
love
so
the
day
went
by
over
that
shattered
life
and
each
hour
the
despair
grew
more
black
his
grief
and
misery
more
hopeless
the
girl
watched
him
and
followed
him
about
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
but
she
could
get
him
to
take
no
food
and
to
divert
his
mind
to
anything
else
she
dared
not
even
try
he
would
sit
for
hours
writhing
in
his
torment
and
then
again
he
would
spring
up
and
pace
the
room
in
agitation
though
he
was
too
weak
to
bear
that
very
long
afterwards
the
long
night
came
on
and
all
through
it
he
lay
tossing
and
moaning
sometimes
shuddering
in
a
kind
of
paroxysm
of
grief
helen
though
she
was
weary
and
almost
fainting
watching
thro
the
whole
night
her
heart
wild
with
her
dread
and
so
the
morning
came
and
another
day
of
misery
and
in
the
midst
of
it
david
flung
himself
down
upon
the
sofa
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
and
cried
out
god
my
god
i
can
not
stand
it
i
can
not
stand
it
oh
let
me
die
i
dare
not
lift
my
head
there
is
no
hope
for
me
there
is
no
life
for
me
i
dare
not
pray
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
i
am
beaten
i
am
lost
forever
and
helen
fell
down
upon
her
knees
beside
him
and
tore
away
his
hands
from
his
face
and
stared
at
him
frantically
exclaiming
it
is
too
cruel
oh
have
mercy
upon
me
david
if
you
love
me
he
stopped
and
gazed
long
and
earnestly
into
her
face
and
a
look
of
infinite
pity
came
into
his
eyes
at
last
he
whispered
in
a
low
voice
poor
little
helen
oh
helen
god
help
you
what
can
i
do
he
paused
and
afterwards
went
on
tremblingly
have
you
done
that
you
should
suffer
like
this
you
are
right
that
it
is
too
cruel
it
is
another
curse
that
i
have
to
bear
for
i
knew
that
i
was
born
to
suffering
i
knew
that
my
life
was
broken
and
dying
and
yet
i
dared
to
take
yours
into
it
and
now
what
can
i
do
to
save
you
helen
can
you
not
see
that
i
dare
not
live
it
is
you
who
are
killing
yourself
the
girl
moaned
in
answer
he
did
not
reply
but
there
came
a
long
long
silence
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
sinking
still
deeper
and
when
he
went
on
it
was
in
a
shuddering
voice
that
made
helen
heart
stop
it
is
no
use
he
gasped
is
no
use
listen
helen
there
was
another
secret
that
i
kept
from
you
because
it
was
too
fearful
but
i
can
keep
it
no
more
i
can
fight
no
more
he
stopped
the
girl
had
clutched
his
arm
and
was
staring
into
his
face
whispering
his
name
hoarsely
at
last
he
went
on
in
his
cruel
despair
knew
this
years
ago
too
and
i
knew
that
i
was
bringing
it
upon
you
the
misery
of
this
wretched
dying
body
oh
it
hurts
it
hurts
now
and
he
put
his
hand
over
his
heart
as
a
look
of
pain
came
into
his
face
can
not
stand
much
more
my
heart
he
panted
time
must
come
they
told
me
it
would
come
years
ago
and
then
and
then
the
man
stopped
because
he
was
looking
at
helen
she
had
not
made
a
sound
but
her
face
had
turned
so
white
and
her
lips
were
trembling
so
fearfully
that
he
dared
not
go
on
she
gave
a
loud
choking
cry
and
burst
out
wildly
david
david
it
is
fiendish
you
have
no
right
to
punish
me
so
oh
have
mercy
upon
me
for
you
are
killing
me
you
have
no
right
to
do
it
i
tell
you
it
is
a
crime
you
promised
me
your
love
and
if
you
loved
me
you
would
live
for
my
sake
you
would
think
of
me
a
thing
so
cruel
ought
not
to
be
it
can
not
be
right
god
could
never
have
meant
a
human
soul
to
suffer
so
and
there
must
be
pardon
in
the
world
there
must
be
light
it
can
not
all
be
torture
like
this
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
flung
herself
upon
david
bosom
sobbing
again
and
again
no
no
it
is
too
fearful
oh
save
me
save
me
he
did
not
answer
her
as
she
looked
up
at
him
again
she
saw
the
same
look
of
fearful
woe
and
read
the
cruel
fact
that
there
was
no
help
that
her
own
grief
and
pleadings
were
only
deepening
the
wretchedness
she
stared
at
him
for
a
long
time
and
when
she
spoke
to
him
again
it
was
with
a
sudden
start
and
in
a
strange
ghastly
voice
then
david
there
is
no
god
he
trembled
but
the
words
choked
him
as
he
tried
to
respond
and
his
head
dropped
then
at
last
she
heard
him
moan
how
can
god
free
my
soul
from
this
madness
how
can
he
deliver
me
from
such
a
curse
helen
could
say
no
more
could
only
cling
to
him
and
sob
in
her
fright
so
the
day
passed
away
and
another
night
came
and
still
the
crushed
and
beaten
soul
was
writhing
in
its
misery
lost
in
blackness
and
despair
and
still
helen
read
it
all
in
his
white
and
tortured
features
and
drank
the
full
cup
of
his
soul
fiery
pain
they
took
no
heed
of
the
time
but
it
was
long
after
darkness
had
fallen
and
once
when
the
girl
had
gone
upstairs
for
a
moment
she
heard
david
pacing
about
and
then
heard
a
stifled
cry
she
rushed
down
and
stopped
short
in
the
doorway
for
the
man
was
upon
his
knees
his
face
uplifted
in
wild
entreaty
god
oh
merciful
god
he
sobbed
the
days
of
my
life
i
have
sought
for
righteousness
labored
and
suffered
to
keep
my
soul
alive
and
oh
was
it
all
for
this
was
it
to
go
down
in
blackness
and
night
to
die
a
beaten
man
crushed
and
lost
oh
i
can
not
bear
it
i
can
not
bear
it
it
can
not
it
must
not
be
he
sank
forward
upon
the
sofa
and
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
and
the
girl
could
hear
his
breathing
in
the
stillness
at
last
she
crept
across
the
room
and
knelt
down
beside
him
and
whispered
softly
in
his
ear
do
not
give
me
your
heart
any
more
david
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
answered
her
and
then
it
was
to
moan
helen
my
heart
is
broken
i
can
give
it
to
no
one
once
i
had
strength
and
faith
and
could
love
but
now
i
am
lost
and
ruined
and
there
is
nothing
that
can
save
me
i
dare
not
live
and
i
dare
not
die
and
i
know
not
where
to
turn
he
started
up
suddenly
clasping
his
hands
to
his
forehead
and
staggering
across
the
room
crying
out
no
it
can
not
be
oh
it
can
not
be
there
must
be
some
way
of
finding
pardon
some
way
of
winning
tightness
for
a
soul
oh
god
what
can
i
do
for
peace
but
then
again
he
sank
down
and
hid
his
face
and
sobbed
out
the
face
of
this
nightmare
with
this
horror
fronting
me
cried
for
pardon
and
none
after
that
there
was
a
long
silence
with
helen
crouching
in
terror
by
his
side
she
heard
him
groan
is
all
over
it
is
finished
i
can
fight
no
more
and
then
again
came
stillness
and
when
she
lifted
him
and
gazed
into
his
face
she
knew
not
which
was
worse
the
silent
helpless
despair
that
was
upon
it
or
the
torment
and
the
suffering
that
had
gone
before
she
tried
still
to
soothe
him
begging
and
pleading
with
him
to
have
mercy
upon
her
he
asked
her
faintly
what
he
could
do
and
the
poor
girl
seeing
how
weak
and
exhausted
he
was
could
think
of
only
the
things
of
the
body
and
begged
him
to
try
to
rest
has
been
two
nights
since
you
have
slept
david
she
whispered
can
not
sleep
with
this
burden
upon
my
soul
he
answered
her
but
still
she
pleaded
with
him
begging
him
as
he
loved
her
and
he
yielded
to
her
at
last
and
broken
and
helpless
as
he
was
she
half
carried
him
upstairs
and
laid
him
upon
the
bed
as
if
he
had
been
a
little
child
that
seemed
to
help
little
however
for
he
only
lay
tossing
and
moaning
god
it
must
end
i
can
not
bear
it
those
were
the
last
words
helen
heard
for
the
poor
girl
was
exhausted
herself
almost
to
fainting
she
lay
down
without
undressing
and
her
head
had
scarcely
touched
the
pillow
before
she
was
asleep
in
the
meantime
through
the
long
david
lay
writhing
and
crying
out
for
help
the
moon
rose
dim
and
red
behind
the
mountains
it
had
mounted
high
in
the
sky
and
the
room
was
bright
with
it
when
at
last
the
man
rose
from
the
bed
and
began
swiftly
pacing
the
room
still
muttering
to
himself
he
sank
down
upon
his
knees
by
the
window
and
gazed
up
at
the
silent
moon
then
again
he
rose
and
turned
suddenly
and
after
a
hurried
glance
at
helen
went
to
the
door
and
passed
out
closing
it
silently
behind
him
and
whispered
to
himself
half
deliriously
great
god
it
must
end
it
must
end
it
was
more
than
an
hour
afterwards
that
the
girl
awakened
from
her
troubled
sleep
she
lay
for
an
instant
half
dazed
trying
to
bring
back
to
her
mind
what
had
happened
and
then
she
put
out
her
hand
and
discovered
that
her
husband
was
no
longer
by
her
she
sat
up
with
a
wild
start
and
at
the
same
instant
her
ear
was
caught
by
a
sound
outside
of
footsteps
pacing
swiftly
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
upon
the
piazza
the
girl
leaped
up
with
a
stifled
cry
and
ran
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
steps
the
room
below
was
still
half
lighted
by
the
flickering
and
helen
shadow
loomed
up
on
the
opposite
wall
as
she
rushed
across
the
room
and
opened
the
door
the
gray
light
of
dawn
was
just
spreading
across
the
lake
but
the
girl
noticed
only
one
thing
her
husband
swiftly
moving
figure
she
rushed
to
him
and
as
he
heard
her
he
turned
and
stared
at
her
an
instant
as
if
dazed
and
then
staggered
with
a
cry
into
her
arms
david
she
exclaimed
is
the
matter
then
as
she
clasped
him
to
her
she
found
that
his
body
was
trembling
convulsively
and
that
his
hand
as
she
took
it
was
hot
like
fire
she
called
to
him
again
in
yet
greater
anxiety
david
what
is
it
you
will
kill
me
if
you
treat
me
so
he
answered
her
weakly
dear
nothing
and
she
caught
him
to
her
and
turned
and
half
carried
him
into
the
house
she
staggered
into
a
chair
with
him
and
then
sat
gazing
in
terror
at
his
countenance
for
the
man
forehead
was
burning
and
moist
and
his
frame
was
shaking
and
broken
he
was
completely
prostrated
by
the
fearful
agitation
that
had
possessed
him
helen
cried
to
him
once
more
but
he
could
only
pant
wait
and
sink
back
and
let
his
head
fall
upon
her
arm
he
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
breathing
swiftly
and
shuddering
now
and
then
was
god
he
panted
with
a
sudden
start
his
voice
choking
has
shown
me
his
face
he
has
set
me
free
then
again
for
a
long
time
he
lay
with
heaving
bosom
helen
whispering
to
him
pleadingly
david
as
he
opened
his
eyes
the
girl
saw
a
wonderful
look
upon
his
face
and
at
last
he
began
speaking
in
a
low
shaking
voice
and
pausing
often
to
catch
his
breath
helen
he
said
is
all
gone
but
i
won
and
my
life
prayer
has
not
been
for
nothing
i
was
never
so
lost
so
beaten
but
all
the
time
there
was
a
voice
in
my
soul
that
cried
to
me
to
fight
that
there
was
glory
enough
in
god
home
for
even
me
and
oh
it
came
it
came
david
sank
back
and
there
was
a
long
silence
before
he
went
on
was
wonderful
helen
he
whispered
has
come
nothing
like
it
to
me
in
all
my
life
for
i
had
never
drunk
such
sorrow
before
never
known
such
fearful
need
it
seems
as
if
all
the
forces
of
my
nature
broke
loose
in
one
wild
fearful
surge
as
if
there
was
a
force
behind
me
like
a
mighty
driving
storm
that
swept
me
on
and
away
beyond
self
and
beyond
time
and
out
into
the
life
of
things
it
was
like
the
surging
of
fierce
music
it
was
the
great
ocean
of
the
infinite
bursting
its
way
into
my
heart
and
it
bore
me
on
so
that
i
was
mad
with
it
so
that
i
knew
not
where
i
was
only
that
i
was
panting
for
breath
and
that
i
could
bear
it
no
more
and
cried
out
in
pain
david
as
he
spoke
had
been
lifting
himself
the
memory
of
his
vision
taking
hold
of
him
once
more
but
then
he
sank
down
again
and
whispered
i
have
no
more
strength
i
can
do
no
more
but
it
was
god
and
i
am
free
he
lay
trembling
and
breathing
fast
again
but
sinking
back
from
his
effort
and
closing
his
eyes
exhaustedly
after
a
long
time
he
went
on
in
a
faint
voice
suppose
if
i
had
lived
long
ago
that
would
have
been
a
vision
of
god
heaven
and
yet
there
was
not
an
instant
of
it
even
when
i
fell
down
upon
the
ground
and
when
i
struck
my
hands
upon
the
stones
because
they
were
numb
and
burning
when
i
did
not
know
just
what
it
was
the
surging
passion
of
my
soul
flung
loose
at
last
it
was
like
the
voices
of
the
stars
and
the
mountains
that
whisper
of
that
which
is
and
which
conquers
of
that
which
conquers
without
sound
or
sign
helen
i
thought
of
that
wonderful
testament
of
pascal
that
has
haunted
me
all
my
lifetime
those
strange
wild
gasping
words
of
a
soul
gone
mad
with
awe
and
beyond
all
utterance
except
a
cry
joy
tears
of
joy
and
i
thought
of
a
still
more
fearful
story
i
thought
that
it
must
have
been
such
that
rang
through
the
soul
of
the
master
and
swept
him
away
beyond
scorn
and
pain
so
that
the
men
about
him
seemed
like
jeering
phantoms
that
he
might
scatter
with
his
hand
before
the
glory
of
vision
in
which
it
was
all
one
to
live
or
die
oh
it
is
that
which
has
brought
me
my
peace
god
needs
not
our
help
but
only
our
worship
and
beside
his
glory
all
our
guilt
is
nothing
and
there
is
no
madness
like
our
fear
and
oh
if
we
can
only
hold
to
that
and
fight
for
it
conquer
all
temptation
and
all
pain
all
fear
because
we
must
die
and
cease
to
be
the
man
had
clenched
his
hands
again
and
was
lifting
himself
with
the
wild
look
upon
his
countenance
he
seemed
to
the
girl
to
be
delirious
and
she
was
shuddering
half
with
awe
and
half
with
terror
she
interrupted
him
in
a
sudden
burst
of
alarm
yes
but
david
david
not
now
not
now
it
is
too
much
you
will
kill
yourself
can
die
he
panted
can
die
but
i
can
not
ever
be
mastered
again
never
again
be
blind
oh
helen
all
my
life
i
have
been
lost
and
beaten
beaten
by
my
weakness
and
my
fear
but
this
once
this
once
i
was
free
this
once
i
knew
and
i
lived
and
now
i
can
die
rejoicing
listen
to
me
helen
while
i
am
here
there
can
be
no
more
delaying
no
more
weakness
such
sin
and
doubt
as
that
of
yesterday
must
never
conquer
my
soul
again
i
will
not
any
more
be
at
the
mercy
of
chance
i
love
you
helen
god
knows
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
soul
and
this
much
for
love
i
will
do
if
god
spares
me
a
day
take
you
and
tear
the
heart
out
of
you
if
need
be
but
only
teach
you
to
live
teach
you
to
hold
by
this
truth
it
is
a
fearful
thing
helen
it
is
madness
to
me
to
know
that
at
any
instant
i
may
cease
to
be
and
that
you
may
be
left
alone
in
your
terror
and
your
weakness
oh
look
at
me
look
at
me
there
is
no
more
tempting
fate
there
is
no
more
shirking
the
battle
there
is
life
there
is
life
to
be
lived
and
it
calls
to
you
now
and
now
you
must
win
cost
just
what
it
may
in
blood
and
tears
you
have
the
choice
between
that
and
ruin
and
before
god
you
shall
choose
the
right
listen
to
me
helen
it
is
only
prayer
that
can
do
it
it
is
only
by
prayer
that
you
can
fight
this
fearful
battle
bring
before
you
this
truth
of
the
soul
and
hold
on
to
it
hold
on
to
it
tho
it
kill
you
for
he
was
through
all
the
ages
his
glory
is
of
the
skies
and
we
are
but
for
an
instant
and
we
have
to
die
and
this
we
must
know
or
we
are
lost
there
comes
pain
and
calls
you
back
to
fear
and
doubt
and
you
fight
oh
it
is
a
cruel
fight
it
is
like
a
wild
beast
at
your
vitals
but
still
you
hold
on
you
hold
on
the
man
had
lifted
himself
with
a
wild
effort
his
hands
clenched
and
his
teeth
set
he
had
caught
the
girl
hands
in
his
and
she
screamed
in
fear
david
you
will
kill
yourself
yes
he
answered
and
rushed
on
chokingly
is
coming
just
so
for
i
have
just
force
enough
left
to
win
just
force
enough
to
save
you
and
then
it
will
rend
this
frame
of
mine
in
two
it
comes
like
a
clutch
at
my
heart
it
blinds
me
and
the
sky
seems
to
turn
to
fire
he
sank
back
with
a
gasp
helen
caught
him
to
her
bosom
exclaiming
frantically
david
spare
me
wait
not
now
you
can
not
bear
it
have
mercy
he
lay
for
a
long
time
motionless
seemingly
half
dazed
then
he
whispered
faintly
dear
yes
let
us
wait
but
oh
if
you
could
know
the
terror
of
another
defeat
of
sinking
down
and
letting
one
self
be
bound
in
the
old
chains
i
must
not
lose
helen
i
dare
not
fail
david
whispered
helen
beginning
suddenly
with
desperate
swiftness
should
you
fail
why
can
you
not
listen
to
me
pity
me
wait
until
you
are
strong
you
have
won
you
will
not
forget
and
is
there
no
peace
can
you
not
rest
in
this
faith
and
fear
no
more
the
man
seemed
to
helen
to
be
half
out
of
his
mind
for
the
moment
she
was
trying
to
manage
him
with
a
kind
of
frenzied
cunning
as
she
went
on
whispering
and
imploring
she
saw
that
david
exhaustion
was
gradually
overcoming
him
more
and
more
and
that
he
was
sinking
farther
and
farther
back
from
his
wild
agitation
at
last
after
she
had
continued
thus
for
a
while
he
closed
his
eyes
and
began
breathing
softly
dear
he
whispered
i
will
be
quiet
there
has
come
to
my
soul
a
peace
that
is
not
for
words
i
can
be
still
and
know
that
he
is
god
and
that
he
is
his
voice
dropped
lower
each
instant
the
girl
in
the
meantime
soothing
him
and
stroking
his
forehead
and
pleading
with
him
in
a
shuddering
voice
her
heart
wild
with
fright
when
at
last
he
was
quite
still
and
the
fearful
vision
that
had
been
like
a
nightmare
to
her
was
gone
with
all
its
storm
and
its
madness
she
took
him
upon
her
lap
just
as
she
had
done
before
and
sat
there
clasping
him
in
her
arms
while
the
time
fled
by
unheeded
it
was
long
afterwards
the
sun
was
gleaming
across
the
lake
and
in
at
the
window
before
at
last
her
trembling
prayer
was
answered
and
he
sank
into
an
exhausted
slumber
she
sat
watching
him
for
a
long
time
still
quite
white
with
fear
and
weariness
finally
however
she
rose
and
carrying
the
frail
body
in
her
arms
laid
it
quietly
upon
the
sofa
in
the
next
room
she
knelt
watching
it
for
a
time
then
went
out
upon
the
piazza
closing
the
door
behind
her
and
there
the
fearful
tension
that
the
dread
of
wakening
him
had
put
upon
her
faculties
gave
way
at
last
and
the
poor
girl
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sank
down
sobbing
convulsively
god
oh
god
what
can
i
do
how
can
i
bear
it
she
gazed
about
her
wildly
exclaiming
can
not
stand
it
and
there
is
no
one
to
help
me
what
i
do
perhaps
it
was
the
first
real
prayer
that
had
ever
passed
lips
but
the
burden
of
her
sorrow
was
too
great
just
then
for
her
to
bear
alone
even
in
thought
she
leaned
against
the
railing
of
the
porch
with
her
arms
stretched
out
before
her
imploringly
her
face
uplifted
and
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
she
poured
out
one
frantic
cry
the
only
cry
that
she
could
think
of
god
have
mercy
upon
me
have
mercy
upon
me
i
can
not
bear
it
so
she
sobbed
on
and
several
minutes
passed
but
there
came
to
her
no
relief
when
she
thought
of
david
of
his
breaking
body
and
of
his
struggling
soul
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
caught
in
the
grip
of
a
fiend
and
that
no
power
could
save
her
she
could
only
clasp
her
hands
together
and
shudder
and
whisper
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
thus
it
was
that
the
time
sped
by
and
the
morning
sun
rose
higher
in
front
of
her
and
shone
down
upon
the
wild
and
wan
figure
that
seemed
like
a
phantom
of
the
night
she
was
still
crouching
in
the
same
position
her
mind
as
overwrought
and
hysterical
as
ever
when
a
strange
and
unexpected
event
took
place
one
which
seemed
to
her
at
first
in
her
state
of
fright
like
some
delusion
of
her
mind
except
for
her
own
emotion
and
for
the
faint
sound
of
the
waves
upon
the
shore
everything
about
her
had
been
still
her
ear
was
suddenly
caught
however
by
the
noise
of
a
footstep
and
she
turned
and
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
coming
down
the
path
from
the
woods
she
started
to
her
feet
gazing
in
surprise
it
was
broad
daylight
then
and
helen
could
see
the
person
plainly
she
took
only
one
glance
and
reeled
and
staggered
back
as
if
it
were
a
ghost
at
which
she
was
gazing
she
crouched
by
a
pillar
of
the
porch
trembling
like
a
leaf
and
scarcely
able
to
keep
her
senses
leaning
from
side
to
side
and
peering
out
with
her
whole
attitude
expressive
of
unutterable
consternation
and
even
fright
at
last
when
she
had
gazed
until
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
her
to
think
that
she
was
the
victim
of
madness
she
stared
suddenly
up
into
the
air
and
caught
her
forehead
in
her
hands
at
the
same
time
whispering
to
herself
in
an
almost
fainting
voice
heaven
what
can
it
mean
can
it
be
real
can
it
be
true
is
arthur
chapter
iv
i
am
merlin
and
i
am
dying
am
merlin
who
follow
the
helen
stood
gazing
at
the
figure
in
utter
consternation
for
at
least
half
a
minute
before
she
could
find
voice
then
she
bent
forward
and
called
to
him
wildly
it
was
the
other
turn
to
be
startled
then
and
he
staggered
backward
as
he
gazed
up
at
helen
his
look
showed
plainly
that
he
too
was
half
convinced
that
he
was
gazing
at
a
phantom
of
his
own
mind
and
for
a
long
time
he
stood
pressing
his
hands
to
his
heart
and
unable
to
make
a
sound
or
a
movement
when
finally
he
broke
the
silence
his
voice
was
a
hoarse
whisper
he
panted
in
heaven
name
are
you
doing
here
and
then
as
the
girl
answered
is
my
home
arthur
he
gave
another
start
live
here
with
him
he
gasped
him
echoed
helen
in
a
low
voice
whom
arthur
he
answered
that
a
look
of
amazement
crossed
helen
face
tho
followed
quickly
by
a
gleam
of
comprehension
she
had
quite
forgotten
that
arthur
knew
nothing
about
what
she
had
done
she
said
did
not
marry
harrison
then
seeing
that
he
was
staring
at
her
in
still
greater
wonder
she
went
on
hastily
seems
strange
to
go
back
to
those
old
days
now
but
once
i
meant
to
tell
you
all
about
it
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
slowly
the
time
i
was
engaged
to
that
man
i
was
wretched
and
when
i
saw
you
the
last
time
that
dreadful
time
by
the
road
it
was
almost
more
than
i
could
bear
so
i
took
back
my
wicked
promise
of
marriage
and
came
to
see
you
and
tell
you
all
about
as
the
girl
had
been
speaking
the
other
had
been
staring
at
her
with
a
look
upon
his
face
that
was
indescribable
a
look
that
was
more
terror
than
anything
else
he
had
staggered
back
he
grasped
at
a
tree
to
support
himself
helen
saw
the
look
and
stopped
frightened
herself
is
it
arthur
she
cried
is
the
matter
came
to
see
me
the
other
gasped
hoarsely
came
to
see
me
and
i
and
i
was
gone
arthur
said
helen
had
gone
the
night
before
and
i
could
not
find
you
then
i
met
this
man
that
i
loved
and
you
wrote
that
you
had
torn
the
thought
of
me
from
your
heart
and
so
again
helen
stopped
for
the
man
had
sunk
backwards
with
a
cry
that
made
her
heart
leap
in
fright
she
exclaimed
taking
a
step
towards
him
and
he
answered
her
with
a
moan
stretching
out
his
arms
to
her
god
helen
that
letter
was
a
lie
helen
stopped
rooted
to
the
spot
lie
she
whispered
faintly
a
lie
cried
the
other
with
a
sudden
burst
of
emotion
leaping
up
and
starting
towards
her
i
have
suffered
the
tortures
of
hell
i
loved
you
i
love
you
now
the
girl
sprang
back
and
the
blood
rushed
to
her
cheeks
half
instinctively
she
drew
her
light
dress
more
tightly
about
her
and
the
other
saw
the
motion
and
stopped
a
look
of
despair
crossing
his
face
the
two
stood
thus
for
fully
a
minute
staring
at
each
other
wildly
then
suddenly
arthur
asked
love
this
man
whom
you
have
married
you
love
him
the
girl
answered
i
love
him
and
arthur
arms
dropped
and
his
head
sank
forward
there
was
a
look
upon
his
face
that
tore
helen
heart
to
see
so
that
for
a
moment
or
two
she
stood
quite
dazed
with
this
new
terror
then
all
at
once
however
the
old
one
came
back
to
her
thoughts
and
with
a
faint
cry
she
started
toward
her
old
friend
stretching
out
her
arms
to
him
and
calling
to
him
imploringly
arthur
she
cried
mercy
upon
me
do
not
frighten
me
any
more
arthur
if
you
only
knew
what
i
have
suffered
you
would
pity
me
you
could
not
help
it
you
would
not
fling
this
burden
of
your
misery
upon
me
the
man
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
and
for
the
first
time
he
seemed
to
become
aware
of
the
new
helen
the
helen
who
had
replaced
the
girl
he
had
known
he
read
in
her
ghastly
white
face
some
hint
of
what
she
had
been
through
and
his
own
look
turned
quickly
to
one
of
wonder
and
even
awe
he
whispered
you
ill
arthur
she
responded
quickly
full
of
desperate
hope
as
she
saw
his
change
ill
but
oh
so
frightened
i
have
been
more
wretched
than
you
can
ever
dream
can
you
not
help
me
arthur
will
you
not
i
was
almost
despairing
i
thought
that
my
heart
would
burst
can
you
not
be
unselfish
the
man
gazed
at
her
at
least
a
minute
and
when
he
answered
at
last
it
was
in
a
low
grave
voice
that
was
new
to
her
will
do
it
helen
he
said
is
it
the
girl
came
toward
him
her
voice
sinking
must
not
let
him
hear
us
arthur
she
whispered
then
as
she
gazed
into
his
face
she
added
pathetically
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
have
wished
that
i
might
only
have
someone
to
sympathize
with
me
and
help
me
i
can
tell
everything
to
you
are
not
happy
with
your
husband
asked
the
other
in
a
wondering
tone
not
able
to
guess
what
she
meant
echoed
helen
he
is
ill
and
i
have
been
so
terrified
i
feared
that
he
was
going
to
die
we
have
had
such
a
dreadful
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
gazed
about
her
swiftly
and
laying
her
finger
upon
her
lips
is
asleep
now
she
went
on
for
the
first
time
in
three
nights
and
i
was
afraid
that
we
might
waken
him
we
must
not
make
a
sound
for
it
is
so
she
stopped
and
the
other
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
was
three
nights
ago
she
continued
oh
we
were
so
happy
before
it
but
there
came
a
strange
woman
a
fearful
creature
and
she
was
drunk
and
my
husband
found
her
and
brought
her
home
she
was
delirious
she
died
here
in
his
arms
while
there
was
no
one
to
help
her
the
dreadful
thing
was
that
david
had
known
this
woman
when
she
was
a
girl
helen
paused
again
and
caught
her
breath
for
she
had
been
speaking
very
swiftly
shaken
by
the
memory
of
the
scene
the
other
put
in
in
a
low
tone
heard
all
about
this
woman
death
helen
and
i
know
about
her
that
was
how
i
happen
to
be
and
the
girl
gave
a
start
echoing
you
happen
to
be
here
afterwards
she
added
quickly
i
forgot
to
ask
you
about
that
what
do
you
mean
arthur
he
hesitated
a
moment
before
he
answered
her
speaking
very
slowly
is
so
sad
helen
he
said
is
almost
too
cruel
to
talk
he
stopped
again
and
the
girl
looked
at
him
wondering
then
he
went
on
to
speak
one
sentence
that
struck
her
like
a
bolt
of
lightning
from
the
sky
that
poor
woman
was
my
mother
and
helen
staggered
back
almost
falling
clutching
her
hands
to
her
forehead
and
staring
half
dazed
she
panted
he
bowed
his
head
sadly
answering
helen
it
is
dreadful
and
the
girl
leaped
towards
him
seizing
him
by
the
shoulders
with
a
thrilling
cry
she
stared
into
his
eyes
her
own
glowing
like
fire
she
gasped
again
he
only
looked
at
her
wonderingly
as
if
thinking
she
was
mad
until
suddenly
she
burst
out
frantically
are
david
child
you
are
david
child
and
then
for
fully
half
a
minute
the
two
stood
staring
at
each
other
too
much
dazed
to
move
or
to
make
a
sound
at
last
arthur
echoed
the
words
scarcely
audibly
child
and
added
is
your
husband
as
helen
whispered
again
they
stood
panting
for
breath
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
girl
could
find
another
word
to
speak
except
over
and
over
child
she
seemed
unable
to
realize
quite
what
it
meant
she
seemed
unable
to
put
the
facts
together
but
then
suddenly
arthur
whispered
it
was
your
husband
who
ruined
that
woman
and
as
helen
answered
she
grasped
a
little
of
the
truth
and
also
of
arthur
thought
she
ran
on
swiftly
oh
it
was
not
his
fault
he
was
only
a
boy
arthur
and
he
wished
to
marry
her
but
they
would
not
let
him
i
must
tell
you
about
that
then
she
stopped
short
however
and
when
she
went
on
it
was
in
sudden
wild
joy
that
overcame
all
her
other
feelings
joy
that
gleamed
in
her
face
and
made
her
fling
herself
down
upon
her
knees
before
arthur
and
clutch
his
hands
in
hers
she
cried
was
god
who
sent
you
arthur
oh
i
know
that
it
was
god
it
is
so
wonderful
to
think
of
to
have
come
to
us
all
in
a
flash
and
it
will
save
david
life
it
was
the
thought
of
the
child
and
the
fate
that
it
might
have
suffered
that
terrified
him
most
of
all
arthur
and
now
to
think
that
it
is
you
oh
you
and
you
are
david
son
i
can
not
believe
it
i
can
not
believe
it
then
with
a
wild
laugh
she
sprang
up
again
and
turned
exclaiming
he
will
be
so
happy
i
must
tell
him
we
must
not
lose
an
instant
she
caught
arthur
hand
again
and
started
towards
the
house
but
she
had
not
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
before
she
halted
suddenly
and
whispered
no
i
forgot
he
is
asleep
and
we
must
not
waken
him
now
we
must
wait
and
then
again
the
laughter
broke
out
over
her
face
and
she
turned
upon
him
radiant
is
so
wonderful
she
cried
is
so
wonderful
to
be
happy
to
be
free
once
more
and
after
so
much
darkness
oh
it
is
like
coming
out
of
prison
arthur
dear
arthur
just
think
of
it
and
david
will
be
so
glad
the
tears
started
into
the
girl
eyes
she
turned
away
to
gaze
about
her
at
the
golden
morning
and
to
drink
in
great
draughts
of
its
freshness
that
made
her
bosom
heave
the
life
seemed
to
have
leaped
back
into
her
face
all
at
once
and
the
color
into
her
cheeks
and
she
was
more
beautiful
than
ever
think
of
being
happy
she
panted
again
oh
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
waking
david
you
do
not
know
how
happy
i
could
be
do
you
think
i
ought
to
waken
him
anyway
arthur
it
is
so
wonderful
it
will
make
him
strong
again
it
is
so
beautiful
that
you
whom
i
have
always
been
so
fond
of
that
you
should
be
david
son
and
you
can
live
here
and
be
happy
with
us
arthur
do
you
know
i
used
to
think
how
much
like
david
you
looked
and
wonder
at
it
but
oh
are
you
sure
it
is
true
she
chanced
to
think
of
the
letter
that
had
been
left
at
her
father
and
exclaimed
must
have
been
that
you
have
been
home
arthur
she
added
quickly
while
father
was
up
here
said
he
wanted
to
see
your
father
i
could
not
stay
away
from
home
any
longer
i
was
so
very
lonely
and
unhappy
arthur
stopped
for
a
moment
and
the
girl
paled
slightly
as
he
saw
it
he
continued
rapidly
was
no
one
there
but
the
servant
and
she
gave
me
the
did
she
not
tell
you
about
me
asked
helen
asked
if
you
were
married
arthur
said
would
not
listen
to
any
more
for
i
could
not
bear
it
when
i
had
read
the
letter
i
came
up
here
to
look
for
my
poor
mother
i
wanted
to
see
her
i
was
as
lonely
as
she
ever
was
and
i
wanted
someone
sympathy
even
that
poor
beaten
soul
i
heard
in
the
town
that
she
was
dead
they
told
me
where
the
grave
was
and
that
was
how
i
happened
out
here
i
thought
i
would
see
it
once
before
i
left
and
before
the
people
who
lived
in
this
house
were
awake
helen
when
i
saw
i
thought
it
was
a
is
wonderful
arthur
whispered
the
girl
is
almost
too
much
to
believe
but
oh
i
ca
think
of
anything
except
how
happy
it
will
make
david
i
love
him
so
arthur
and
you
will
love
him
too
you
can
not
help
but
love
me
about
it
all
helen
the
other
answered
heard
nothing
you
know
about
my
poor
mother
before
helen
answered
the
question
she
glanced
about
her
at
the
morning
landscape
and
for
the
first
time
thought
of
the
fact
that
it
was
cold
us
go
inside
she
said
can
sit
there
and
talk
until
david
and
the
two
stole
in
helen
opening
the
door
very
softly
david
was
sleeping
in
the
next
room
so
that
it
was
possible
not
to
disturb
him
the
two
sat
down
before
the
flickering
fire
and
conversed
in
low
whispers
the
girl
told
him
the
story
of
david
love
and
told
him
all
about
david
and
arthur
in
turn
told
her
how
he
had
been
living
in
the
meantime
only
because
he
saw
how
suddenly
happy
she
was
and
withal
how
nervous
and
overwrought
he
said
no
more
of
his
sufferings
and
helen
had
forgotten
them
utterly
it
was
pathetic
to
see
her
delight
as
she
thought
of
being
freed
from
the
fearful
terror
that
had
haunted
her
she
was
like
a
little
child
in
her
relief
will
be
so
happy
he
will
be
so
happy
she
whispered
again
and
again
can
all
be
so
happy
the
thought
that
arthur
was
actually
david
son
was
so
wonderful
that
she
seemed
never
to
be
able
to
realize
it
fully
and
every
time
she
uttered
the
thought
it
was
a
sweep
of
the
wings
of
her
soul
arthur
had
to
tell
her
many
times
that
it
was
actually
mary
who
had
been
named
in
that
letter
so
an
hour
or
two
passed
by
and
still
david
did
not
waken
helen
had
crept
to
the
door
once
or
twice
to
listen
to
his
quiet
breathing
but
each
time
thinking
of
his
long
trial
she
had
whispered
that
she
could
not
bear
to
disturb
him
yet
however
she
was
getting
more
and
more
impatient
and
she
asked
arthur
again
and
again
you
think
i
ought
to
wake
him
now
do
you
think
so
even
if
it
is
just
for
a
minute
you
know
for
oh
he
will
be
so
glad
it
will
be
like
waking
up
in
heaven
so
it
went
on
until
at
last
she
could
keep
the
secret
no
longer
she
thought
for
a
while
and
then
whispered
know
what
i
will
do
i
will
play
some
music
and
waken
him
in
that
way
that
will
not
alarm
him
and
it
will
be
she
went
to
the
piano
and
sat
down
will
seem
queer
to
be
playing
music
at
this
hour
she
whispered
but
then
she
glanced
at
the
clock
and
saw
that
it
was
nearly
seven
and
added
no
we
have
often
begun
by
this
time
you
know
arthur
we
used
to
get
up
wonderfully
early
all
summer
because
it
was
so
beautiful
then
and
we
used
to
have
music
at
all
sorts
of
times
oh
you
can
not
dream
how
happy
we
were
you
must
wait
until
you
see
david
and
then
you
will
know
why
i
love
him
so
she
stopped
and
sat
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
whispering
shall
i
play
then
she
exclaimed
know
arthur
i
will
play
something
that
he
loves
very
much
and
that
you
used
to
love
too
something
that
is
very
soft
and
low
and
arthur
had
seated
himself
beside
the
piano
and
was
gazing
at
her
the
girl
sat
still
for
a
moment
more
gazing
ahead
of
her
and
waiting
for
everything
to
be
hushed
then
she
began
so
low
as
scarcely
to
be
audible
the
first
movement
of
the
wonderful
as
it
stole
upon
the
air
and
swelled
louder
she
smiled
because
it
was
so
beautiful
a
way
to
waken
david
and
yet
there
are
few
things
in
music
more
laden
with
concentrated
mournfulness
than
that
sonata
with
the
woe
that
is
too
deep
for
tears
as
the
solemn
beating
of
it
continued
in
spite
of
themselves
the
two
found
that
they
were
hushed
and
silent
it
brought
back
to
helen
mind
all
of
david
suffering
it
seemed
to
be
the
very
breathing
of
his
sorrow
and
yet
still
she
whispered
on
to
herself
will
waken
and
then
he
will
be
happy
in
the
next
room
david
lay
sleeping
at
first
it
had
been
heavily
because
he
was
exhausted
and
afterwards
when
the
stupor
had
passed
restlessly
and
with
pain
then
at
last
came
the
music
falling
softly
at
first
and
blending
with
his
dreaming
and
afterwards
taking
him
by
the
hand
and
leading
him
out
into
the
land
of
reality
until
he
found
himself
lying
and
listening
to
it
as
he
recollected
all
that
had
happened
he
gave
a
slight
start
and
sat
up
wondering
at
the
strangeness
of
helen
playing
then
he
raised
his
head
and
then
rose
to
call
her
and
at
that
instant
came
the
blow
the
man
suddenly
gave
a
fearful
start
he
staggered
back
upon
the
sofa
clutching
at
his
side
with
his
hand
his
face
turning
white
and
a
look
of
wild
horror
coming
over
it
for
an
instant
he
held
himself
up
by
the
sofa
staring
around
him
and
then
he
sank
back
half
upon
the
floor
his
head
falling
backwards
and
so
he
lay
gasping
torn
with
agony
while
the
fearful
music
trod
on
the
relentless
throbbing
of
it
like
a
hammer
upon
his
soul
twice
he
strove
to
raise
himself
and
failed
and
twice
he
started
to
cry
out
and
checked
himself
in
terror
and
so
it
went
on
until
the
place
of
despair
was
reached
until
there
came
that
one
note
in
the
music
that
is
the
plunge
into
night
helen
stopped
suddenly
there
and
everything
was
deathly
still
except
for
the
fearful
heaving
of
david
bosom
that
silence
lasted
for
several
moments
helen
seemed
to
be
waiting
and
listening
and
david
whole
being
was
in
suspense
then
suddenly
he
gave
a
start
for
he
heard
the
girl
coming
to
the
door
with
a
gasp
of
dread
he
half
raised
himself
grasping
the
sofa
with
his
knotted
hands
he
slid
down
half
crawling
and
half
falling
into
the
corner
where
he
crouched
breathless
and
shuddering
so
he
was
when
helen
came
into
the
room
she
did
not
see
him
on
the
sofa
and
she
gave
a
startled
cry
she
wheeled
about
and
gazed
around
the
room
can
he
be
she
exclaimed
is
not
here
and
ran
out
to
the
piazza
then
came
a
still
more
anxious
call
david
where
are
you
and
in
the
meantime
david
was
still
crouching
in
the
corner
his
face
uplifted
and
torn
with
agony
he
gave
one
fearful
sob
and
then
he
sank
forward
drawing
himself
by
the
sheer
force
of
his
arms
he
crawled
again
into
sight
and
lay
clinging
to
the
sofa
then
he
gave
a
faint
gasping
cry
and
the
girl
heard
it
and
rushed
to
the
door
she
gave
one
glance
at
the
prostrate
form
and
at
the
white
face
and
then
leaped
forward
with
a
shrill
scream
a
scream
that
echoed
through
the
little
house
and
that
froze
arthur
blood
she
flung
herself
down
on
her
knees
beside
her
husband
crying
david
and
the
man
looked
up
at
her
with
his
ghastly
face
and
his
look
of
terror
and
panted
helen
it
has
come
she
screamed
again
more
wildly
than
before
and
caught
him
to
her
bosom
in
frenzy
no
david
no
no
she
cried
out
but
he
only
whispered
hoarsely
again
has
come
meanwhile
arthur
had
rushed
into
the
room
and
the
two
lifted
the
sufferer
up
to
the
sofa
where
he
sank
back
and
lay
for
a
moment
or
two
half
dazed
then
in
answer
to
poor
helen
agonized
pleading
he
gazed
at
her
once
more
david
she
sobbed
choking
to
me
it
can
not
be
david
no
no
and
see
here
is
arthur
arthur
and
david
he
is
your
son
he
is
mary
child
the
man
gave
a
faint
start
and
looked
at
her
in
bewilderment
then
as
she
repeated
the
words
again
is
your
son
he
is
child
gradually
a
look
of
wondering
realization
crossed
his
countenance
and
he
turned
and
stared
up
at
arthur
it
true
he
whispered
hoarsely
is
no
doubt
helen
answered
him
yes
again
and
again
swiftly
and
desperately
as
if
thinking
that
the
joy
of
it
would
restore
his
waning
strength
the
thought
did
bring
a
wonderful
look
of
peace
over
david
face
as
he
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
and
comprehended
it
all
he
caught
arthur
arm
in
his
trembling
hands
god
be
praised
he
whispered
is
almost
too
much
oh
take
care
of
her
take
care
of
her
for
me
the
girl
flung
herself
upon
his
bosom
sobbing
madly
and
david
sank
back
and
lay
for
an
instant
or
two
with
his
eyes
shut
before
at
last
her
suffering
roused
him
again
he
lifted
himself
up
on
his
elbows
with
a
fearful
effort
he
whispered
in
a
deep
hollow
voice
to
me
listen
to
me
i
have
only
a
minute
more
to
the
girl
buried
her
head
in
his
bosom
with
another
cry
but
he
shook
her
back
and
caught
her
by
the
wrists
at
the
same
time
sitting
erect
a
strain
that
made
the
veins
in
his
temples
start
out
at
me
he
gasped
at
me
and
as
the
girl
stared
into
his
eyes
that
were
alive
with
the
last
frenzied
effort
of
his
soul
he
went
on
speaking
with
fierce
swiftness
and
panting
for
breath
between
each
phrase
helen
listen
to
me
twenty
years
i
have
kept
myself
alive
on
earth
by
such
a
struggle
by
the
power
of
a
will
that
would
not
yield
and
now
there
is
but
an
instant
more
an
instant
i
can
not
bear
it
except
to
save
your
soul
for
i
am
going
do
you
hear
me
going
and
you
must
stay
and
you
have
the
battle
for
your
life
to
fight
listen
to
me
look
into
my
eyes
for
you
must
call
up
your
powers
now
before
it
is
too
late
you
can
not
shirk
it
do
you
hear
me
it
is
here
and
as
the
man
was
speaking
the
frenzied
words
the
look
of
a
tiger
had
come
into
his
face
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
and
he
held
helen
wrists
in
a
grip
that
turned
them
black
tho
then
she
did
not
feel
the
pain
she
was
gazing
into
his
face
convulsed
with
fright
and
the
man
gasped
for
breath
once
more
and
then
rushed
on
fight
like
this
conies
once
to
a
soul
helen
and
it
wins
or
it
loses
and
you
must
win
do
you
hear
me
i
am
dying
helen
i
am
going
and
i
leave
you
to
god
and
to
life
he
is
he
made
you
and
he
demands
your
worship
and
your
faith
that
you
hold
your
soul
lord
of
all
chances
that
you
make
yourself
master
of
your
life
and
now
is
your
call
now
you
clench
your
hands
and
you
pray
it
tears
your
and
it
bursts
your
brain
but
you
say
that
you
will
that
you
will
that
you
oh
god
that
i
have
left
you
so
helpless
that
i
did
not
show
you
the
peril
of
your
soul
for
you
win
oh
if
i
could
but
find
a
word
for
you
for
you
stand
upon
the
brink
of
ruin
and
you
have
but
an
instant
but
an
instant
to
save
yourself
to
call
up
the
vision
of
your
faith
before
you
and
tho
the
effort
kill
you
not
to
let
it
go
girl
if
you
fail
no
power
of
earth
or
heaven
can
save
you
from
despair
and
oh
have
i
lived
with
you
for
nothing
showed
you
no
faith
given
you
no
power
helen
save
me
have
mercy
upon
me
i
can
not
stand
this
and
i
dare
not
i
dare
not
die
the
man
was
leaning
forward
gazing
into
the
girl
face
his
own
countenance
fearful
to
see
could
die
he
gasped
could
die
with
a
song
he
has
shown
me
his
face
and
he
is
good
but
i
dare
not
leave
you
you
and
i
am
going
helen
helen
the
man
fearful
force
seemed
to
have
been
acting
upon
the
girl
like
magnetism
for
tho
the
look
of
wild
suffering
had
not
left
her
face
she
had
raised
herself
and
was
staring
into
his
burning
eyes
then
suddenly
with
an
effort
that
shook
her
frame
she
clenched
her
hands
and
gave
a
gasp
for
breath
and
panted
scarcely
audibly
can
i
do
david
head
had
sunk
but
he
mastered
himself
once
more
and
he
whispered
leave
you
to
god
i
leave
you
to
life
you
can
be
a
soul
you
can
win
you
win
you
must
and
worship
and
rejoice
you
must
kneel
here
here
while
i
am
going
never
more
to
return
and
you
must
know
that
you
can
never
see
me
again
that
i
shall
no
longer
exist
and
you
must
cling
to
your
faith
in
the
god
who
made
you
and
praise
him
for
all
that
he
does
and
you
will
not
shed
a
tear
not
a
tear
and
his
grip
tightened
yet
more
desperately
he
stared
in
one
last
wild
appeal
and
gasped
again
me
not
a
tear
and
again
the
throbbing
force
of
his
soul
roused
the
girl
she
could
not
speak
she
was
choking
but
she
gave
a
sign
of
assent
and
then
all
at
once
david
fearful
hold
relaxed
he
gave
one
look
more
one
that
stamped
itself
upon
helen
soul
forever
by
its
fearful
intensity
of
yearning
and
after
it
he
breathed
a
sigh
that
seemed
to
pant
out
the
last
mite
of
strength
in
his
frame
and
sank
backwards
upon
the
sofa
with
helen
still
clinging
to
him
there
for
an
instant
or
two
he
lay
breathing
feebly
and
the
girl
heard
a
faint
whisper
again
a
tear
not
a
tear
he
opened
his
eyes
once
more
and
gazed
at
her
dimly
and
then
a
slight
trembling
shook
his
frame
his
chest
heaved
once
more
and
sank
and
after
it
everything
was
still
for
an
instant
helen
stared
at
him
dazed
then
she
clutched
him
by
the
shoulders
whispering
calling
louder
and
louder
in
frenzied
terror
david
he
gave
no
answer
and
with
a
cry
that
was
fearful
to
hear
the
girl
clutched
him
to
her
the
body
was
limp
and
lifeless
the
head
fell
forward
as
if
the
neck
were
broken
and
helen
staggered
backward
with
a
scream
there
came
an
instant
of
fierce
agony
then
she
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
reeling
and
swaying
clutching
her
head
in
her
hands
her
face
upturned
and
tortured
and
first
she
gasped
is
dead
and
then
shall
not
ever
see
him
again
and
she
choked
and
swallowed
a
lump
in
her
throat
whispering
in
awful
terror
a
tear
not
a
tear
and
then
she
flung
up
her
arms
and
sank
forward
with
an
incoherent
cry
and
fell
senseless
into
arthur
arms
a
week
had
passed
since
david
death
and
helen
was
in
her
home
once
more
sitting
by
the
window
in
the
gathering
twilight
she
was
yery
pale
and
her
eyes
were
sunken
and
hollow
but
the
beauty
of
her
face
was
still
there
tho
in
a
strange
and
terrible
way
her
hand
was
resting
upon
arthur
and
she
was
gazing
into
his
eyes
and
speaking
in
a
deep
solemn
voice
will
not
ever
leave
me
arthur
i
know
it
will
not
ever
leave
me
it
is
like
a
fearful
vision
that
haunts
me
night
and
day
a
voice
that
cries
out
in
my
soul
and
will
not
let
me
rest
and
i
know
i
shall
never
again
be
able
to
live
like
other
people
never
be
free
from
its
madness
for
oh
i
do
not
think
it
is
often
that
a
human
soul
sees
what
i
saw
he
seemed
to
drag
me
out
into
the
land
of
death
with
him
into
the
very
of
god
and
i
almost
went
with
him
arthur
almost
can
you
dream
what
i
suffered
have
you
any
idea
of
what
it
means
to
a
human
being
to
make
such
an
effort
i
loved
that
man
as
if
he
had
been
my
own
soul
i
was
bound
to
him
so
that
he
was
all
my
life
and
to
have
him
go
was
like
tearing
my
heart
in
two
and
he
had
told
me
that
i
should
never
see
him
again
that
there
was
nothing
to
look
for
beyond
death
and
yet
arthur
i
won
do
you
ever
realize
it
i
won
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
earth
were
reeling
about
me
as
if
the
very
air
i
breathed
were
fire
and
oh
i
thought
that
he
was
dead
that
he
was
gone
from
me
forever
and
i
believed
that
i
was
going
mad
and
then
arthur
those
awful
words
of
his
came
ringing
through
my
mind
a
tear
not
a
tear
i
had
no
faith
i
could
see
nothing
but
that
the
world
was
black
with
horror
and
yet
i
heard
those
words
it
was
love
it
was
even
fear
i
think
that
held
me
to
it
i
had
worshiped
his
sacredness
i
had
given
all
my
soul
to
the
wonder
of
his
soul
and
i
dared
not
be
false
to
him
i
dared
not
dishonor
him
and
i
knew
that
he
had
told
me
that
grief
was
a
crime
that
there
was
truth
in
the
world
that
i
might
cling
to
and
oh
arthur
i
won
it
i
won
it
i
kept
the
faith
david
faith
and
it
is
still
alive
upon
the
earth
it
seems
to
me
almost
as
if
i
had
won
his
soul
from
death
as
if
i
had
saved
his
spirit
in
if
i
could
still
rejoice
in
his
life
still
have
his
power
and
his
love
and
there
is
a
kind
of
fearful
consecration
in
my
heart
a
glory
that
i
am
afraid
to
know
of
as
if
god
hand
had
been
laid
upon
me
used
to
tell
me
arthur
that
if
only
that
power
is
roused
in
a
soul
if
only
it
dwells
in
that
sacredness
there
can
no
longer
be
fear
or
evil
in
its
life
that
the
strife
and
the
vanity
and
the
misery
in
this
cruel
world
about
us
come
from
nothing
else
but
that
men
do
not
know
this
vision
that
it
is
so
hard
so
dreadfully
hard
to
win
and
he
used
to
say
that
this
power
is
infinite
that
it
depends
only
upon
how
much
one
wants
it
and
that
he
who
possessed
it
had
the
gift
of
king
midas
and
turned
all
things
that
he
touched
to
gold
that
is
real
madness
to
me
arthur
and
will
not
let
me
be
still
and
yet
i
know
that
it
can
not
ever
die
in
me
for
whenever
there
is
an
instant
weakness
there
flashes
over
me
again
the
fearful
thought
of
david
that
he
is
gone
back
into
nothingness
that
nowhere
can
i
ever
see
him
ever
hear
his
voice
or
speak
to
him
again
i
am
and
that
makes
me
clench
my
hands
and
nerve
my
soul
and
fight
again
and
still
again
arthur
i
did
that
for
days
and
did
not
once
know
because
david
had
told
me
to
because
i
was
filled
with
a
fearful
terror
of
proving
a
coward
soul
because
i
had
heard
him
say
that
if
one
only
held
the
faith
and
prayed
the
word
would
come
to
him
at
last
and
it
was
true
it
was
true
arthur
it
was
like
the
tearing
apart
of
the
skies
it
was
as
if
i
had
rent
my
way
through
them
i
saw
as
i
had
never
dreamed
i
could
see
when
i
heard
david
speak
of
it
how
god
presence
is
infinite
and
real
how
it
guides
the
blazing
stars
and
how
our
life
is
but
an
instant
and
is
nothing
beside
it
and
how
it
makes
no
difference
that
we
pass
into
nothingness
his
glory
is
still
the
same
then
i
saw
too
what
a
victory
i
had
won
arthur
how
i
could
live
in
it
and
how
i
was
free
and
master
of
my
life
there
came
over
me
a
feeling
for
which
there
is
no
word
a
kind
of
demon
force
that
was
madness
i
thought
of
that
wonderful
sixth
chapter
of
isaiah
that
david
used
to
think
so
much
beyond
reading
that
he
used
to
call
the
artist
chapter
and
oh
i
knew
just
what
it
was
that
i
had
to
do
in
the
world
helen
had
been
speaking
very
intensely
her
voice
shaking
the
other
gaze
was
riveted
upon
her
face
she
added
her
voice
sinking
to
a
whisper
have
no
art
but
you
have
and
we
must
fight
together
for
this
fearful
glory
we
must
win
this
prize
of
and
for
a
long
time
the
two
sat
in
silence
trembling
while
the
darkness
gathered
about
them
helen
had
turned
her
head
and
gazed
out
with
face
uplifted
at
the
starry
shield
that
quivered
and
shook
above
them
suddenly
arthur
saw
her
lips
moving
again
and
heard
her
speaking
the
wonderful
words
that
she
had
referred
to
her
voice
growing
more
and
more
intense
and
sinking
into
a
whisper
of
awe
the
year
that
king
uzziah
died
i
saw
also
the
lord
sitting
upon
a
throne
high
and
lifted
up
and
his
train
filled
the
temple
it
stood
the
seraphims
each
one
had
six
wings
with
twain
he
covered
his
face
and
with
twain
he
covered
his
feet
and
with
twain
he
did
fly
one
cried
unto
another
and
said
holy
holy
holy
is
the
lord
of
hosts
the
whole
earth
is
full
of
his
glory
the
posts
of
the
door
moved
at
the
voice
of
him
that
cried
and
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke
said
i
woe
is
me
for
i
am
undone
because
i
am
a
man
of
unclean
lips
and
i
dwell
in
the
midst
of
a
people
of
unclean
lips
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
king
the
lord
of
hosts
flew
one
of
the
seraphims
unto
me
having
a
living
coal
in
his
hand
which
he
had
taken
with
the
tongs
from
off
the
altar
he
laid
it
upon
my
mouth
and
said
lo
this
hath
touched
thy
lips
and
thine
iniquity
is
taken
away
and
thy
sin
purged
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
saying
whom
shall
i
send
and
who
will
go
for
us
then
said
i
here
am
i
send
the
end
