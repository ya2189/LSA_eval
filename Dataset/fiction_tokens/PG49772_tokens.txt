chapter
i
the
braidge
the
people
on
deck
bent
over
some
until
heads
touched
knees
others
more
exactly
calculating
just
sufficiently
to
clear
the
beams
the
passed
beneath
the
bridge
and
all
straightened
themselves
on
their
the
gentlemen
who
were
smoking
put
their
cigars
again
between
their
lips
the
two
or
three
ladies
resumed
book
or
knitting
the
sun
was
low
and
the
sycamores
and
willows
fringing
the
banks
cast
long
shadows
across
the
canal
the
northern
bank
was
not
so
clothed
with
foliage
and
one
saw
an
expanse
of
bottom
land
meadows
and
cornfields
and
beyond
low
mountains
purple
in
the
evening
light
the
boat
slipped
from
a
stripe
of
gold
into
a
stripe
of
shadow
and
from
a
stripe
of
shadow
into
a
stripe
of
gold
the
negro
and
the
mule
on
the
towpath
were
now
but
a
bit
of
dusk
in
motion
and
now
were
lit
and
so
to
speak
powdered
with
now
the
rope
between
boat
and
towpath
showed
an
golden
serpent
and
now
it
did
not
show
at
all
now
a
little
cloud
of
gnats
and
flies
accompanying
the
boat
shone
in
burnished
armour
and
now
they
put
on
a
mantle
of
shade
a
dark
little
girl
of
twelve
years
dark
and
thin
sitting
aft
on
the
deck
floor
her
long
legs
folded
decorously
under
her
her
blue
gingham
skirt
spread
out
and
her
leghorn
hat
upon
her
knees
appealed
to
one
of
the
reading
ladies
aunt
serena
what
is
miss
serena
ashendyne
laid
down
her
book
she
said
blankly
is
evolution
i
heard
grandfather
say
it
just
now
he
said
man
darwin
and
his
evolution
oh
said
miss
serena
he
meant
a
very
wicked
and
irreligious
englishman
who
wrote
a
dreadful
book
was
it
named
no
i
forget
just
what
it
is
called
no
of
species
that
was
it
have
we
got
it
in
the
library
at
gilead
balm
heavens
no
why
your
grandfather
would
let
it
come
into
the
house
no
lady
would
read
it
oh
miss
serena
returned
to
her
novel
she
sat
very
elegantly
on
the
a
graceful
drooping
form
in
a
delaine
picked
out
with
tiny
daisies
it
was
made
polonaise
miss
serena
alone
of
the
people
at
gilead
balm
kept
up
with
the
fashions
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
narrow
deck
a
knot
of
country
gentlemen
were
telling
war
stories
all
had
fought
in
the
war
the
war
that
had
been
over
now
for
twenty
years
and
more
there
were
an
empty
sleeve
and
a
wooden
leg
in
the
group
and
other
marks
of
bullet
and
sabre
they
told
good
stories
the
country
gentlemen
and
they
indulged
in
mellow
laughter
blue
rings
of
rose
and
mingled
and
made
a
haze
about
that
end
of
the
boat
how
the
gentlemen
are
enjoying
themselves
said
placidly
one
of
the
knitting
ladies
the
dark
little
girl
continued
to
ponder
the
omission
from
the
library
aunt
serena
yes
hagar
is
it
like
jones
jones
what
do
you
know
about
jones
grandfather
was
reading
it
one
day
and
laughing
and
after
he
had
done
with
it
i
got
it
down
from
the
top
shelf
and
asked
him
if
i
might
read
it
and
he
said
certainly
not
it
is
a
book
for
ladies
your
grandfather
was
quite
right
you
read
entirely
too
much
anyway
bude
told
your
mother
so
the
little
girl
turned
large
alarmed
eyes
upon
her
i
do
read
half
as
much
as
i
used
to
i
do
read
except
just
a
little
time
in
the
morning
and
evening
and
after
supper
it
would
me
if
i
read
well
well
said
miss
serena
i
suppose
we
shall
continue
to
spoil
you
she
said
it
in
a
very
sweet
voice
and
she
patted
the
child
arm
and
then
she
went
back
to
the
wooing
she
was
fond
of
reading
novels
herself
though
she
liked
better
to
do
macram√©
work
and
to
paint
porcelain
placques
the
glided
on
it
was
almost
the
last
in
the
state
and
upon
almost
its
last
journey
presently
there
would
go
away
forever
the
long
musical
winding
of
the
horn
it
would
never
echo
any
more
among
the
purple
hills
but
the
locomotive
would
shriek
here
as
it
shrieked
elsewhere
beyond
the
willows
and
sycamores
across
the
river
whose
reaches
were
seen
at
intervals
gangs
of
convicts
with
keepers
and
guards
and
overseers
were
at
work
upon
the
railroad
the
boat
passing
through
a
lock
the
dark
little
girl
stared
fascinated
at
one
of
these
convicts
a
trusty
a
young
white
man
who
was
there
at
the
on
some
errand
and
who
now
stood
speaking
to
the
stout
old
man
on
the
coping
of
masonry
as
the
water
in
the
lock
fell
and
the
boat
was
steadily
lowered
and
the
stone
walls
on
either
hand
grew
higher
and
higher
the
figure
of
the
convict
came
to
stand
far
above
all
on
deck
dressed
hideously
in
broad
stripes
of
black
and
white
it
stood
against
the
calm
evening
sky
with
a
sense
of
something
withdrawn
and
yet
gigantic
the
face
was
only
once
turned
toward
the
boat
with
its
freight
of
people
who
dressed
as
they
pleased
it
was
not
at
all
a
bad
face
and
it
was
boyishly
young
the
boat
slipped
from
the
lock
and
went
on
down
the
canal
between
green
banks
the
negro
on
the
towpath
was
singing
and
his
rich
voice
floated
across
for
everywhere
i
went
ter
pray
i
met
all
hell
right
on
my
way
the
country
gentlemen
were
laughing
again
wrapped
in
the
blue
and
fragrant
smoke
the
captain
of
the
came
up
the
companionway
and
passed
from
group
to
group
like
a
benevolent
patriarch
down
below
supper
was
cooking
one
smelled
the
coffee
the
sun
was
slipping
lower
in
the
green
bottoms
the
frogs
were
choiring
standing
in
the
prow
of
the
boat
a
negro
winded
the
long
horn
it
echoed
and
echoed
from
the
purple
hills
the
dark
little
girl
was
still
staring
at
the
dwindling
lock
the
figure
striped
like
a
zebra
was
there
yet
though
it
had
come
down
out
of
the
sky
and
had
now
only
the
green
of
the
country
about
and
behind
it
it
grew
smaller
and
smaller
until
it
was
no
larger
than
a
woodpecker
it
was
gone
she
appealed
again
to
miss
serena
aunt
serena
what
do
you
suppose
he
did
miss
serena
who
prided
herself
upon
her
patience
put
down
her
book
for
the
tenth
time
of
whom
are
you
speaking
hagar
that
man
back
there
the
convict
i
did
notice
him
but
if
he
is
a
convict
he
probably
did
something
very
wicked
hagar
sighed
i
do
think
ought
to
be
made
to
dress
like
that
it
it
smudged
my
soul
just
to
look
at
it
convicts
said
miss
serena
are
not
usually
people
of
fine
feelings
and
you
ought
to
take
warning
by
him
never
to
do
anything
wicked
a
silence
while
the
trees
and
the
flowering
blackberry
bushes
went
by
then
aunt
serena
yes
the
woman
over
there
with
the
baby
she
says
her
husband
got
hurt
in
an
accident
and
she
got
to
get
to
him
and
she
has
got
any
money
the
stout
man
gave
her
something
and
i
the
captain
let
her
pay
ca
i
would
you
ca
i
give
her
just
a
little
the
trouble
is
said
miss
serena
that
you
never
know
whether
or
not
those
people
are
telling
the
truth
and
we
are
rich
as
you
know
hagar
but
if
you
want
to
you
can
go
ask
your
grandfather
if
he
will
give
you
something
to
give
the
dark
little
girl
undoubled
her
legs
got
up
smoothed
down
her
blue
gingham
dress
and
went
forward
until
the
wrapped
her
in
a
fragrant
fog
out
of
it
came
genially
the
colonel
voice
rich
as
old
madeira
shot
like
shot
silk
with
curious
electric
tensions
and
strains
and
agreements
a
voice
at
once
mellifluous
and
capable
of
revealments
demanding
other
adjectives
a
voice
that
was
the
colonel
and
spoke
the
colonel
from
head
to
heel
it
went
with
his
beauty
intact
yet
at
with
the
greying
amber
of
his
hair
mustache
and
imperial
with
his
eyes
not
large
but
finely
shaped
and
coloured
with
his
slightly
aquiline
nose
with
the
height
and
easy
swing
of
his
body
that
was
neither
too
spare
nor
too
full
it
went
with
him
from
head
to
foot
and
though
it
was
certainly
not
a
loud
voice
nor
a
one
it
quite
usually
dominated
whatever
group
for
the
moment
enclosed
the
colonel
he
was
speaking
now
in
a
kind
of
energetic
golden
drawl
so
he
came
up
to
me
and
said
it
ashendyne
if
gentlemen
ca
be
allowed
in
this
degenerate
age
to
rule
their
own
households
and
arrange
their
own
duels
he
became
aware
of
the
child
standing
by
him
and
put
out
a
nervous
hand
yes
gipsy
what
is
it
you
want
now
hagar
explained
sedately
her
husband
hurt
and
ca
get
to
him
to
nurse
him
said
the
colonel
well
well
that
pretty
bad
i
suppose
we
must
take
up
a
collection
pass
the
hat
gipsy
hagar
went
to
each
of
the
country
gentlemen
not
with
the
suggested
hat
but
with
her
small
palm
held
out
cupped
one
by
one
they
dropped
into
it
quarter
or
dime
and
each
as
his
coin
tinkled
down
had
for
the
collector
of
bounty
a
drawling
caressing
humorous
word
she
thanked
each
gentleman
as
his
bit
of
silver
touched
her
hand
and
thanked
with
a
sedate
little
manner
of
perfection
manners
at
gilead
balm
were
notoriously
of
a
perfection
hagar
took
the
money
to
the
woman
with
the
baby
and
gave
it
to
her
shyly
with
a
red
spot
in
each
cheek
she
was
careful
to
explain
when
the
woman
began
to
stammer
thanks
that
it
was
from
her
grandfather
and
the
other
gentlemen
and
that
they
were
anxious
to
help
she
was
a
very
honest
little
girl
with
an
honest
wish
to
place
credit
where
it
belonged
back
beside
miss
serena
she
sat
and
studied
the
moving
green
banks
the
sun
was
almost
down
there
were
wonderful
golden
clouds
above
the
mountains
willow
and
sycamore
on
the
river
side
of
the
canal
fell
away
across
an
emerald
marshy
strip
you
saw
the
bright
larger
stream
mirror
for
the
bright
sky
and
across
it
in
turn
you
saw
limestone
cliffs
topped
with
shaggy
woods
and
you
heard
the
sound
of
picks
against
rock
and
saw
another
band
of
convicts
white
and
black
making
the
railroad
the
horn
was
blown
again
long
musical
somewhat
mournfully
echoing
the
negro
on
the
towpath
riding
sideways
on
his
mule
was
singing
still
aunt
serena
yes
hagar
why
is
it
that
women
do
have
any
money
miss
serena
closed
her
book
she
glanced
at
the
fields
and
the
we
shall
be
at
gilead
balm
in
ten
you
ask
too
many
questions
hagar
it
is
a
very
bad
habit
to
be
always
interrogating
it
is
quite
distinctly
unladylike
chapter
ii
gilead
balm
at
the
gilead
balm
landing
waited
captain
bob
with
a
negro
man
to
carry
up
to
the
house
the
colonel
portmanteau
and
miss
small
leather
trunk
the
came
in
sight
white
and
slow
as
a
deliberate
swan
drew
reflectively
down
the
shining
reach
of
water
and
sidled
to
the
landing
the
colonel
shook
hands
with
all
the
country
gentlemen
and
bowed
to
the
ladies
and
the
country
gentlemen
bowed
to
miss
serena
who
in
turn
bent
her
head
and
smiled
and
the
captain
said
and
the
colonel
gave
the
attendant
darky
a
quarter
and
the
woman
with
the
baby
came
to
that
side
of
the
boat
and
held
for
a
moment
the
hand
of
the
dark
little
girl
and
then
the
gangplank
was
placed
and
the
three
ashendynes
passed
over
to
the
colonel
land
the
horn
blew
again
long
melodious
the
negro
on
the
towpath
said
get
up
to
the
mule
amid
a
waving
of
hands
and
a
chorus
of
slow
agreeable
voices
the
glided
from
the
landing
and
proceeded
down
the
pink
water
between
the
willows
and
sycamores
captain
bob
with
his
hound
luna
at
his
heels
greeted
the
returning
members
of
the
family
well
serena
did
you
have
a
pleasant
visit
hey
gipsy
you
grown
a
week
well
colonel
the
colonel
shook
hands
with
his
brother
very
pleasant
time
bob
good
people
too
good
for
this
damned
world
but
he
breathed
deep
i
am
glad
to
get
home
i
am
always
glad
to
get
home
well
everything
all
right
right
as
a
trivet
the
bishop
here
and
legrand
came
on
the
stage
yesterday
that
good
news
said
the
colonel
the
bishop
always
welcome
and
legrand
is
most
welcome
the
four
began
to
walk
toward
the
house
half
a
mile
away
just
visible
among
great
trees
the
dark
little
girl
walked
beside
the
hound
but
the
hound
kept
her
nose
in
captain
bob
palm
she
was
fond
of
hagar
but
captain
bob
was
her
god
as
for
captain
bob
himself
he
walked
like
a
curious
unfinished
somewhat
flawed
and
shortened
suggestion
of
his
brother
he
was
shorter
than
the
colonel
and
broader
hair
nose
eyes
mouth
were
nothing
like
so
fine
carriage
and
port
were
quite
different
he
lacked
the
he
lacked
the
for
all
that
the
fact
that
they
were
brothers
was
evident
enough
captain
bob
loved
dogs
and
hunting
and
read
the
county
newspaper
and
the
sporting
almanac
he
was
not
complex
times
out
of
a
hundred
he
acted
from
instinct
and
habit
and
the
puzzling
hundredth
time
he
beat
about
for
tradition
and
precedent
he
was
and
spendthrift
with
brains
enough
for
not
too
distant
purposes
emotionally
he
was
strongest
in
family
affection
missed
you
all
he
now
observed
cheerfully
gilead
balm
been
like
a
graveyard
how
is
mother
asked
miss
serena
she
was
picking
her
way
delicately
through
the
green
lane
between
the
evening
primroses
the
delaine
held
just
right
she
wrote
me
that
she
burned
her
hand
trying
the
strawberry
preserves
it
all
right
now
never
saw
old
miss
looking
better
the
dark
little
girl
turned
her
dark
eyes
on
captain
bob
how
is
my
mother
maria
well
i
should
say
that
she
was
all
right
too
i
have
heard
her
complain
gad
i
wish
she
would
complain
ejaculated
the
colonel
then
one
could
tell
her
there
was
nothing
to
complain
about
i
hate
these
women
who
go
through
life
with
a
smile
on
their
lips
and
an
indictment
in
their
eyes
when
there
only
the
usual
up
and
down
of
living
to
indict
i
had
rather
they
would
whine
though
i
hate
them
to
whine
too
but
women
are
all
cowards
no
woman
knows
how
to
take
the
world
the
dark
little
girl
who
had
been
walking
between
the
colonel
and
captain
bob
began
to
tremble
whoever
else
a
coward
my
not
i
do
think
father
you
ought
captain
bob
was
stronger
yet
he
was
fond
of
gipsy
and
he
thought
that
sometimes
the
family
bore
too
hardly
on
maria
now
and
then
he
did
a
small
bit
of
cloudy
thinking
and
when
he
did
it
he
always
brought
forth
the
result
with
a
certain
curious
clearing
of
the
throat
and
nodding
of
the
head
as
though
the
birth
of
an
idea
was
attended
with
considerable
physical
strain
no
colonel
now
he
said
you
ought
damn
it
where
we
be
but
for
women
anyhow
as
for
maria
i
think
you
too
hard
on
maria
the
chief
trouble
with
maria
is
that
she
is
herself
an
ashendyne
of
course
she
ca
help
that
but
i
think
it
is
a
pity
always
did
think
that
men
ought
to
marry
at
least
fifth
or
sixth
cousins
bring
women
in
without
blood
and
traditions
of
people
they
got
to
live
with
of
course
there
trouble
adapting
seen
it
a
score
of
times
maria
just
like
the
rest
when
they
not
cousins
ought
somehow
to
be
cousins
bob
you
are
a
perfect
fool
remarked
the
colonel
he
walked
on
between
the
primroses
his
hands
behind
him
tall
and
easy
in
his
black
coat
and
his
soft
black
hat
the
earth
was
in
shadow
but
the
sky
glowed
carnation
against
it
stood
out
the
long
low
house
of
gilead
balm
at
either
gable
end
rose
pyramidal
cedars
high
and
dark
against
the
vivid
sky
in
the
lane
there
was
the
smell
of
dewy
grass
and
on
either
hand
back
from
the
rail
fences
rolled
the
violet
fields
somewhere
in
the
distance
sounded
the
tinkling
of
cow
bells
the
ardent
sky
began
to
pale
the
swallows
were
circling
above
the
chimneys
of
gilead
balm
and
now
the
silver
venus
came
out
clear
the
little
girl
named
hagar
lagged
a
little
going
up
the
low
hill
on
which
the
house
stood
she
was
growing
fast
and
all
journeys
were
exciting
and
she
was
taking
iron
because
she
was
very
strong
and
she
had
had
a
week
of
change
and
had
been
thinking
hard
and
was
tired
she
wanted
to
see
her
mother
and
indeed
she
wanted
to
see
all
at
gilead
balm
for
unlike
her
mother
she
loved
gilead
balm
but
going
up
the
hill
she
lagged
a
little
partly
it
was
to
look
at
the
star
and
to
listen
to
the
distant
bells
she
was
not
aware
that
she
observed
that
which
we
call
nature
with
a
deep
passion
and
curiosity
that
beauty
was
the
breath
of
her
nostrils
and
that
she
hungered
and
thirsted
after
the
righteousness
of
knowledge
she
only
came
slowly
after
many
years
into
that
much
knowledge
of
herself
she
was
but
an
undeveloped
child
her
mind
a
nebula
just
beginning
to
spiral
in
conversation
she
would
have
applied
the
word
pretty
indiscriminately
to
the
flushed
sky
the
star
the
wheeling
swallows
the
yellow
primroses
but
within
already
the
primroses
struck
one
note
and
the
wheeling
swallows
another
and
the
sky
another
and
the
star
another
and
combined
they
made
a
chord
that
was
like
no
other
chord
already
her
moments
were
distinguished
and
each
time
she
saw
gilead
balm
she
saw
and
dimly
knew
that
she
saw
a
different
gilead
balm
she
climbed
the
hill
a
little
stumblingly
a
dark
thin
child
with
braided
dusky
hair
she
was
so
tired
that
things
went
into
a
kind
of
mist
the
house
and
the
and
the
lock
and
the
convict
and
the
piping
frogs
and
the
in
a
marsh
and
the
word
and
then
up
on
the
low
hilltop
dilsey
and
plutus
lit
the
lamps
and
the
house
had
a
row
of
topaz
eyes
and
here
was
the
cedar
at
the
little
gate
and
the
smell
of
box
box
smell
was
always
of
a
very
especial
character
dark
in
hue
cool
in
temperature
and
quite
unfathomably
old
the
four
passed
through
the
house
gate
and
went
up
the
winding
path
between
the
box
and
the
old
old
blush
roses
and
here
was
the
old
house
dog
roger
fawning
on
the
colonel
and
the
topaz
eyes
were
growing
bigger
bigger
i
am
glad
to
get
home
said
miss
serena
in
front
it
curious
how
every
time
you
go
from
home
something
happens
to
cure
you
of
a
roving
disposition
captain
bob
laughed
never
knew
you
had
a
roving
disposition
serena
luna
here
now
luna
got
a
roving
disposition
have
you
old
girl
luna
replied
miss
serena
with
some
asperity
luna
makes
no
effort
to
alter
her
disposition
i
do
everybody
got
tendencies
and
notions
that
it
is
their
bounden
duty
to
suppress
if
they
do
it
leads
to
all
kind
of
changes
and
and
that
is
what
i
criticize
in
maria
she
makes
no
effort
either
it
most
unfortunate
the
colonel
in
front
of
them
all
moved
on
with
a
fine
serenity
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
in
the
yet
warm
glow
the
of
his
hair
seemed
fairly
luminous
as
he
walked
he
looked
appreciatively
up
at
the
evening
star
he
read
poetry
with
a
fine
discriminating
masculine
taste
and
now
with
a
gesture
toward
the
star
he
repeated
a
line
of
byron
maria
and
her
idiosyncrasies
troubled
him
only
when
they
stood
actually
athwart
his
path
certainly
he
had
never
brooded
upon
them
nor
turned
them
over
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
them
she
was
his
son
wife
more
he
was
inclined
to
think
the
pity
she
was
therefore
ashendyne
and
she
was
housed
at
gilead
balm
he
was
inclined
to
be
fond
of
the
child
hagar
as
for
his
son
the
colonel
in
his
cooler
moments
supposed
damn
it
that
he
and
medway
were
too
much
alike
to
get
on
together
at
any
rate
whatever
the
reason
they
did
not
get
on
together
gilead
balm
had
not
seen
the
younger
ashendyne
for
some
years
he
was
in
europe
whence
he
wrote
at
very
long
intervals
an
amiable
traveller
letter
neither
had
he
and
maria
gotten
on
well
together
the
house
grew
large
filling
all
the
foreground
the
topaz
eyes
changed
to
a
wide
soft
diffused
light
pouring
from
windows
and
the
open
hall
door
in
it
now
appeared
the
figures
of
the
elder
ashendyne
of
the
bishop
and
legrand
coming
out
upon
the
porch
to
welcome
the
travellers
hagar
took
her
grandmother
kiss
and
legrand
kiss
and
the
bishop
kiss
and
then
after
a
few
moments
of
standing
still
in
the
hall
while
the
agreeable
southern
voices
rose
and
fell
she
stole
away
went
up
the
shallow
worn
stairway
turned
to
the
left
and
opened
the
door
of
her
mother
room
she
opened
it
softly
uncle
plutus
says
you
got
a
headache
maria
voice
came
from
the
sofa
in
the
window
yes
i
have
shut
the
door
softly
and
do
let
us
have
any
light
but
i
do
mind
your
sitting
by
me
the
couch
was
deep
and
heaped
with
pillows
maria
slight
small
form
was
drawn
up
in
a
corner
her
head
high
her
hands
twisted
and
locked
about
her
knees
she
wore
a
soft
white
wrapper
tied
beneath
her
breast
with
a
purple
ribbon
she
had
beautiful
hair
thick
and
long
and
dusky
it
was
now
loosened
and
spread
until
it
made
a
covering
for
the
pillows
out
from
its
waves
looked
her
small
face
still
and
exhausted
the
headache
after
having
lasted
all
day
was
going
away
now
at
twilight
she
just
turned
her
dark
eyes
upon
her
daughter
i
do
mind
your
lying
down
beside
me
she
said
there
room
only
do
jar
my
head
hagar
lay
carefully
down
upon
the
couch
her
head
in
the
hollow
of
her
mother
arm
did
you
have
a
good
time
yes
pretty
good
what
did
you
do
there
was
another
little
girl
named
sylvie
we
played
in
the
hayloft
and
we
made
willow
baskets
and
we
cut
paper
dolls
out
of
a
lady
book
i
named
mine
lucy
ashton
and
diana
vernon
and
rebecca
and
she
did
know
any
good
names
so
i
named
hers
for
her
we
named
them
rosalind
and
cordelia
and
vashti
then
there
was
a
lady
who
played
backgammon
with
me
and
i
read
two
books
what
were
they
one
was
travels
i
did
like
it
altogether
though
i
liked
some
of
it
the
other
was
shelley
poems
oh
hagar
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
i
liked
that
better
than
anything
read
you
are
young
to
be
reading
shelley
said
her
mother
she
spoke
with
her
lips
only
her
young
face
high
upon
the
pillows
what
did
you
like
best
hagar
pondered
it
i
liked
the
and
i
liked
the
wind
and
i
liked
the
of
night
some
one
tapped
at
the
door
and
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
opened
it
the
elder
ashendyne
entered
hagar
slipped
from
the
sofa
and
maria
changed
her
position
though
very
slightly
come
in
she
said
though
ashendyne
was
already
in
old
miss
as
the
major
part
of
gilead
balm
called
her
old
miss
crossed
the
room
with
a
stately
tread
and
took
the
winged
chair
she
intended
tarrying
but
a
moment
but
she
was
a
woman
who
never
stood
to
talk
she
always
sat
down
like
a
regent
and
the
standing
was
done
by
others
she
was
a
large
woman
tall
rather
than
otherwise
of
a
distinct
comeliness
and
authoritative
oh
authoritative
from
her
black
lace
cap
on
her
still
brown
smoothly
parted
hair
to
her
list
shoes
black
against
her
white
stockings
now
she
folded
her
hands
upon
her
black
stuff
skirt
and
regarded
maria
are
you
better
yes
thank
you
if
you
would
take
my
advice
said
ashendyne
and
put
horseradish
leaves
steeped
in
hot
water
to
your
forehead
and
the
back
of
your
neck
you
would
find
it
a
great
relief
i
had
some
lavender
water
said
maria
the
horseradish
would
have
been
far
better
are
you
coming
to
supper
no
i
think
not
i
do
not
care
for
anything
i
am
not
hungry
i
will
have
phoebe
fetch
you
a
little
thin
chipped
beef
and
a
beaten
biscuit
and
a
cup
of
coffee
you
must
if
you
gave
way
less
it
would
be
better
for
you
maria
looked
at
her
with
sombre
eyes
at
once
the
fingers
slipped
to
other
and
deeper
notes
if
i
gave
way
less
well
yes
i
do
give
way
i
have
never
seen
how
not
to
i
suppose
if
i
were
cleverer
and
braver
i
should
see
what
i
mean
said
old
miss
with
dignity
is
that
the
lord
for
his
own
good
purposes
and
it
is
to
question
his
purposes
regulated
society
as
it
is
regulated
and
placed
women
where
they
are
placed
no
one
claims
certainly
i
do
claim
that
women
as
women
do
not
see
a
great
deal
of
hardship
the
bible
gives
us
to
understand
that
it
is
their
punishment
then
i
say
take
your
punishment
with
meekness
it
is
possible
that
by
doing
so
you
may
help
earn
remission
for
all
there
was
always
said
maria
something
frightful
to
me
in
the
old
notion
of
for
kings
and
princes
how
very
bad
to
be
the
and
how
infinitely
worse
to
be
the
king
or
prince
whose
you
were
a
red
came
into
ashendyne
face
you
are
at
times
positively
blasphemous
she
said
i
do
not
at
all
see
of
what
personally
you
have
to
complain
if
medway
is
estranged
from
you
you
have
probably
only
yourself
to
thank
i
never
wish
said
maria
to
see
medway
again
medway
mother
rose
with
stateliness
from
the
winged
chair
when
it
comes
to
statements
like
that
from
a
wife
it
is
time
for
people
like
myself
to
take
our
phoebe
shall
bring
you
your
supper
hagar
you
had
better
come
with
me
leave
hagar
here
said
the
other
the
bell
will
ring
in
ten
minutes
come
child
stay
where
you
are
hagar
when
the
bell
rings
she
shall
come
the
elder
ashendyne
voice
deepened
it
is
hard
for
me
to
see
the
mind
of
my
son
child
perverted
filled
with
all
manner
of
foolish
queries
and
rebellions
your
son
child
answered
maria
from
among
her
pillows
happens
to
be
also
my
child
his
family
has
just
had
her
for
a
solid
week
now
pray
let
me
have
her
for
an
hour
her
eyes
dark
and
large
in
her
thin
young
face
narrowed
until
the
lashes
met
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
how
deplorable
is
the
whole
situation
if
i
were
wiser
and
stronger
and
more
heroic
i
suppose
i
should
break
through
it
i
suppose
i
should
go
away
with
hagar
i
suppose
i
should
learn
to
work
i
suppose
i
should
somehow
keep
us
both
i
suppose
i
might
live
again
i
suppose
i
might
even
get
a
divorce

the

a
pool
of
june
sunlight
lay
on
the
library
floor
it
made
a
veritable
pool
of
siloam
with
all
around
a
brown
duskiness
the
room
was
by
no
means
but
there
were
four
tall
mahogany
cases
one
against
each
wall
well
filled
for
the
most
part
with
mellow
calf
flanking
each
case
hung
ashendyne
portraits
in
oval
very
old
gilt
frames
beneath
three
of
these
were
fixed
silhouettes
of
revolutionary
ashendynes
beneath
the

war
photographs
de
a
dozen
in
one
frame
there
was
a
mahogany
escritoire
and
mahogany

and
a
mahogany

and
before
the
fireplace
a
done
in
by
a
colonial
ashendyne
the
curtains
were
down
for
the
summer
and
the
dark
polished
floor
was
bare
the
room
was
large
and
there
presided
a
pleasant
sense
of
unencumbered
space
and
coolness
in
the
parlour
across
the
hall
miss
serena
had
been
allowed
full
power
here
there
was
a
crocheted
macram√©
lambrequin
across
the
and
a
plush
worked
with
chenille
and
fine
thread
tidies
for
the
chairs
and
a

mat
for
the

mounted
on

not

he
had
mounted
his

and
ridden
off
down
the

to
see
a
about
some
piece
of

ashendynes
and
coltsworths
fairly
divided

connections
all
counted
to

degree
traditional
old
friendships
old
acquaintances

people
sometime
their
servants
folk
generally
from

to
blacksmith
the
two
families
and
their
allies
ramified
over
several
hundred
square
miles
and
when
you
said
the
county
what
you
saw
were
ashendynes
and
coltsworths
they
lived
in
brick
houses
set
among
green
acres
and
in
frame
houses
facing
village
streets
none
were
in
the
least
rich
a
frightful
impoverishing
war
being
no
great
time
behind
them
and
many
were
poor

they
had

gone
down
the

to

in

muffled
from

being
carefully
closed
came
the
notes
of
silvery
waves
miss
serena
was
practising
it
was
time
of
year
in
the
brick
kitchen
out
in
the
yard
old
miss
spent
the
morning
with
her
knitting
superintending
operations
a
great
copper
kettle
sat
on
the
stove
between
it
and
the
window
had
been
placed
a
barrel
and
here
perched
a
negro
boy
in
his
hands
a
pole
with

this
he
slowly
stirred
round
and
round
the
bubbling
viscous
mass
in
the
copper
kettle
kitchen
doors
and
windows
were
wide
and
in
came
the
hum
of
bees
and
the
fresh
june
air
and
out
floated
delectable
odours
of
raspberry
jam
old
miss
sat
in
an
ample
low
chair
in
the
doorway
knitting
white
cotton
socks
for
the
colonel
the
bishop
who
was
a
bishop
from

with

every

and
he
said
that
he
hoped
it
was
nothing
much
but
that
he
could
tell
yet
ashendyne
must
lie
quiet
and
take
the
draught
he
left
and
her
room
must
be
kept
still
and
cool
and
he
would
suggest
that
phoebe
whom
she
seemed
to
like
to
have
about
her
should
nurse
her
and
he
would
suggest
too
that
there
be
no
disturbing
conversation
and
that
indeed
she
be
left
in
the
greatest
quiet
it
seemed
nervous
largely
yes
yes
that
true
we
all
ought
to
fight
more
than
we
do
but
the
nervous
system
is
the
imaginary
thing
people
think
she
is
very
strong
and
wrongly
of
course
she
dashes
herself
against
conditions
and
environment
like
a
bird
against
glass
i
do
suppose
said
bude
that
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
travel
maria
lay
in
the
bed
making
images
of
the
light
and
shadow
in
the
room
sometimes
she
asked
for
hagar
and
sometimes
for
hours
she
seemed
to
forget
that
hagar
existed
old
miss
coming
into
the
room
at
one
of
these
times
and
seeing
her
push
the
child
from
her
with
a
frightened
air
and
a
stammering
i
do
know
you
old
miss
later
in
the
day
took
hagar
into
her
own
room
set
her
in
a
chair
beside
her
taught
her
a
new
and
explained
that
it
would
be
kinder
to
remain
out
of
her
mother
room
seeing
that
her
presence
there
evidently
troubled
her
mother
it
troubles
her
sometimes
said
hagar
but
it
does
trouble
her
most
times
most
times
she
likes
me
there
i
do
not
think
you
can
judge
of
that
said
her
grandmother
at
any
rate
i
think
it
best
that
you
should
stay
out
of
the
room
you
can
of
course
go
in
to
say
and
throw
the
thread
over
your
finger
like
that
mimy
is
making
this
morning
and
if
you
want
to
you
can
help
her
cut
them
out
grandmother
please
let
me
go
times
a
day
no
i
do
not
consider
it
best
for
either
of
you
you
heard
the
doctor
say
that
your
mother
must
not
be
agitated
and
you
saw
yourself
a
while
ago
that
she
did
not
seem
to
want
you
i
will
tell
phoebe
be
a
good
obedient
child
bring
me
the
bag
yonder
and
let
see
if
we
ca
find
enough
pink
worsted
for
a
doll
afghan
that
had
been
two
days
ago
hagar
went
morning
and
evening
to
her
mother
room
and
sometimes
maria
knew
her
and
held
her
hands
and
played
with
her
hair
and
sometimes
she
did
not
seem
to
know
her
and
ignored
her
or
talked
to
her
as
a
stranger
her
grandmother
told
her
to
pray
for
her
mother
recovery
she
did
not
need
the
telling
she
loved
her
mother
and
her
petitions
were
frequent
sometimes
she
got
down
on
her
knees
to
make
them
sometimes
she
just
made
them
walking
around
o
god
save
my
mother
for
jesus
sake
amen
o
god
let
my
mother
get
well
for
jesus
sake
amen
she
had
finished
the
pink
afghan
and
she
had
done
the
dusting
and
errands
her
grandmother
appointed
her
this
morning
they
had
let
her
arrange
the
flowers
in
the
bowls
and
vases
she
always
liked
to
do
that
and
she
had
been
happy
for
almost
an
hour
but
then
the
feeling
came
back
the
bright
pool
on
the
library
floor
did
not
reach
to
the
bookcases
they
were
all
in
the
powdered
umber
of
the
rest
of
the
room
hagar
standing
before
one
of
them
first
on
a
hassock
and
then
for
the
upper
shelves
on
a
chair
hunted
something
to
read
ministering
children
she
had
read
it
stepping
heavenward
she
had
read
it
home
influence
and
mother
recompense
she
had
read
them
sherwood
she
had
read
sherwood
many
volumes
of
sherwood
in
after
life
it
was
only
by
a
violent
effort
that
she
dismissed
in
favour
of
any
other
india
the
spectre
of
sherwood
india
parent
assistant
and
moral
tales
she
knew
simple
susan
and
rosamond
and
all
of
them
by
heart
rasselas
she
had
read
it
scottish
chiefs
she
had
read
it
the
forms
of
wallace
and
helen
and
murray
and
edwin
flitted
through
her
mind
she
half
put
out
her
hand
to
the
book
then
withdrew
it
she
was
at
all
happy
and
she
wanted
novelty
miss
m√ºhlbach
prince
eugene
and
his
times
napoleon
and
marie
louise
she
had
read
those
too
the
draytons
and
the
davenants
she
half
thought
she
would
read
about
olive
and
roger
again
but
at
last
she
passed
them
by
also
there
was
anything
on
that
shelf
she
wanted
she
called
it
the
blue
and
green
and
red
shelf
because
the
books
were
bound
in
those
colours
miss
serena
name
was
in
most
of
these
volumes
the
shelf
that
she
undertook
next
had
another
air
to
hagar
each
case
had
its
own
air
and
each
shelf
its
own
air
and
each
book
its
own
air
blair
rhetoric
she
had
read
some
of
that
but
she
want
it
pilgrim
progress
she
knew
that
by
heart
speeches
junius
she
had
read
junius
as
she
had
read
many
another
thing
simply
because
it
was
there
and
a
book
was
a
book
she
had
read
it
without
much
understanding
but
she
liked
the
language
milton
she
knew
a
great
part
of
milton
but
she
did
want
poetry
poetry
was
for
when
you
were
happy
scott
on
another
day
scott
might
have
sufficed
but
she
wanted
something
new
so
new
and
so
interesting
that
it
would
make
the
hard
unhappy
feeling
go
away
she
stepped
from
the
hassock
upon
the
chair
and
began
to
study
the
titles
of
the
books
on
almost
the
top
shelf
there
was
one
in
the
corner
quite
out
of
sight
unless
you
were
on
a
chair
right
up
here
face
to
face
with
the
shelf
the
book
was
even
pushed
back
as
though
it
had
retired
or
had
been
retired
behind
its
fellows
so
as
to
be
out
of
danger
or
perhaps
out
of
the
way
of
being
dangerous
hagar
put
in
her
slender
hand
and
drew
it
forward
until
she
could
read
the
legend
on
the
back
the
descent
of
man
she
drew
it
quite
forth
and
bringing
both
hands
into
play
opened
it
by
charles
darwin
she
turned
the
leaves
there
were
woodcuts
cuts
that
exercised
a
fascination
she
glanced
at
the
first
page
he
who
wishes
to
decide
whether
man
is
the
modified
descendant
of
some
pre√´xisting
form
hagar
turned
upon
the
chair
and
looked
about
her
the
room
was
a
desert
for
solitude
and
balmy
quiet
distantly
through
the
closed
parlour
doors
came
miss
serena
rendering
of
monastery
bells
she
knew
that
her
grandfather
was
down
the
river
and
that
her
grandmother
was
making
raspberry
jam
she
knew
that
the
bishop
was
in
his
room
and
that
legrand
was
out
under
the
cedars
uncle
bob
did
not
count
anyway
he
rarely
asked
embarrassing
questions
she
may
have
hesitated
one
moment
but
no
more
she
got
down
from
the
chair
put
it
back
against
the
wall
closed
the
bookcase
door
and
taking
the
descent
of
man
with
her
went
over
to
the
old
worn
horsehair
sofa
and
curled
herself
up
at
the
end
in
a
cool
and
slippery
hollow
a
shaft
slipping
through
the
window
lit
her
hair
the
printed
page
and
the
slim
hand
that
clasped
it
hagar
knew
quite
well
what
she
was
doing
she
was
going
to
read
a
book
which
if
her
course
were
known
she
would
be
forbidden
to
read
it
had
happened
before
now
that
she
had
read
books
under
the
ban
of
gilead
balm
but
heretofore
she
had
always
been
able
to
say
that
she
had
not
known
that
they
were
so
had
not
known
she
was
doing
wrong
that
could
not
be
said
in
this
case
aunt
serena
had
distinctly
told
her
that
charles
darwin
was
a
wicked
and
irreligious
man
and
that
no
lady
would
read
his
books
but
then
aunt
serena
had
unsparingly
condemned
other
books
which
hagar
mind
yet
refused
to
condemn
she
had
condemned
the
scarlet
letter
when
gilead
balm
discovered
hagar
at
the
last
page
of
that
book
there
had
ensued
a
family
discussion
miss
serena
said
that
she
blushed
when
she
thought
of
the
things
that
hagar
was
learning
the
colonel
had
not
blushed
but
he
said
that
such
books
unsettled
all
received
notions
and
while
he
supported
her
he
was
going
to
have
medway
child
imbibing
damned
anarchical
sentiments
of
any
type
old
miss
said
a
number
of
things
most
of
which
tended
toward
maria
the
latter
had
defended
her
daughter
but
afterwards
she
told
hagar
that
in
this
world
even
if
you
did
think
you
were
doing
wrong
it
made
for
all
the
happiness
there
seemed
to
be
not
to
do
what
other
people
thought
you
ought
not
to
do
but
hagar
did
believe
yet
that
there
was
anything
wrong
in
reading
the
scarlet
letter
she
had
been
passionately
sorry
for
hester
and
she
had
felt
she
did
not
know
why
a
kind
of
terrified
pity
for
dimmesdale
and
she
had
loved
little
pearl
she
had
intended
asking
her
mother
what
the
letter
that
hester
prynne
wore
meant
but
it
had
gone
out
of
her
mind
the
chapter
she
liked
best
was
the
one
with
little
pearl
playing
in
the
wood
perhaps
aunt
serena
having
been
mistaken
about
that
book
was
mistaken
too
about
charles
darwin
neither
now
nor
later
did
she
in
any
wise
love
the
feel
of
forbidden
fruit
did
not
appeal
to
her
merely
because
it
was
forbidden
but
if
there
was
no
inner
forbidding
if
she
truly
doubted
the
justice
or
authority
or
abstract
rightness
of
the
restraining
hand
she
was
capable
of
attaining
the
fruit
whether
forbidden
or
no
there
was
always
the
check
of
great
native
kindliness
if
what
she
wanted
to
do
was
going
no
matter
how
senselessly
to
trouble
or
hurt
other
feelings
on
the
whole
she
would
do
it
in
the
case
of
this
june
day
and
the
descent
of
man
the
library
was
empty
she
only
wanted
to
look
at
the
pictures
and
to
run
over
the
reading
enough
to
see
what
it
was
about
then
she
would
put
it
back
on
the
top
shelf
she
was
not
by
nature
indirect
or
secretive
she
preferred
to
go
straightforwardly
to
act
in
the
open
but
if
the
wall
of
objection
stood
too
high
and
thick
before
her
she
was
capable
of
stealing
forth
in
the
dusk
and
seeking
a
way
around
it
coiled
now
in
the
cool
hollow
of
the
sofa
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
shaft
of
sunshine
she
began
to
read
the
broad
band
of
shifted
place
miss
serena
arrived
at
the
last
ten
minutes
of
her
hour
and
a
half
at
the
piano
began
to
play
pearls
and
roses
out
in
the
brick
kitchen
old
miss
dropped
a
tablespoonful
of
raspberry
jam
into
a
saucer
let
it
cool
tasted
and
pronounced
it
done
the
negro
boy
and
mimy
between
them
lifted
the
copper
kettle
from
the
stove
upstairs
in
gilead
balm
best
room
the
bishop
folded
and
slipped
into
an
addressed
envelope
the
last
letter
he
was
going
to
write
that
morning
out
under
the
cedars
legrand
came
to
a
dull
stretch
in
her
novel
she
yawned
closed
the
book
and
leaned
back
against
the
pillows
in
the
hammock
legrand
was
fair
and
forty
but
only
pleasantly
plump
she
had
a
creamy
skin
moderately
large
hazel
eyes
moderately
far
apart
a
small
straight
nose
a
yielding
mouth
and
a
chin
that
indubitably
would
presently
be
double
she
was
a
widow
and
an
orphan
married
at
nineteen
her
husband
the
stars
of
a
upon
his
grey
collar
had
within
the
year
fallen
upon
some
one
of
the
of
the
state
her
father
the
important
bearer
of
an
old
important
name
had
served
the
confederacy
well
in
a
high
civil
capacity
when
the
long
horror
of
the
war
was
over
and
the
longer
miserable
torture
of
the
reconstruction
was
passing
and
a
comparative
ease
and
pale
dawn
of
prosperity
rose
over
the
state
legrand
looked
about
her
from
the
remnant
of
an
old
plantation
on
the
edge
of
a
tidewater
town
the
house
was
dilapidated
but
large
the
grounds
had
old
neglect
for
gardener
but
they
too
were
large
and
only
needed
for
complete
rehabilitation
legrand
had
a
kind
of
smooth
continuous
energy
but
no
money
a
school
she
murmured
to
herself
when
she
wrote
here
and
there
over
the
state
it
was
at
once
seen
by
her
correspondents
that
this
was
just
the
thing
for
the
daughter
of
a
public
man
and
the
widow
of
a
gallant
officer
it
was
both
ladylike
and
possible
that
was
some
years
ago
legrand
school
for
young
ladies
was
now
an
established
fact
the
house
was
repaired
the
grounds
were
trim
there
was
a
corps
of
six
teachers
with
prospects
of
expansion
there
were
day
pupils
and
boarding
pupils
mrs
legrand
saw
in
her
mind
eye
long
extensions
to
the
main
house
where
more
boarding
pupils
might
be
accommodated
she
was
successful
and
success
agreed
with
her
the
coat
grew
sleek
the
cream
rose
to
the
top
every
angle
disappeared
she
was
warmly
optimistic
and
smooth
indolent
good
company
in
the
she
left
eglantine
and
from
late
june
to
september
shared
her
time
between
the
springs
and
the
country
homes
of
kindred
family
connections
or
girlhood
friends
she
nearly
always
came
for
a
fortnight
or
more
to
gilead
balm
now
leaning
back
in
the
hammock
the
novel
shut
her
eyes
closed
she
was
going
pleasantly
over
to
herself
the
additions
and
improvements
to
be
carried
out
at
eglantine
from
this
her
mind
slipped
to
her
correspondence
with
a
french
teacher
who
promised
well
and
thence
to
certain
letters
received
that
week
from
patrons
with
daughters
one
of
these
from
a
state
farther
south
spoke
in
highest
praise
of
legrand
guardianship
of
the
young
female
mind
of
the
safe
and
elegant
paths
into
which
she
guided
it
and
of
her
gift
generally
for
preserving
dew
and
bloom
and
ignorance
of
evil
in
her
interesting
charges
every
one
likes
praise
and
no
one
is
so
churlish
as
to
refuse
a
proffered
bouquet
or
to
doubt
the
judgment
of
the
donor
legrand
experienced
from
head
to
foot
a
soft
and
amiable
glow
for
ten
minutes
longer
she
lay
in
an
atmosphere
of
balm
then
she
opened
her
eyes
drew
her
watch
from
her
belt
and
glancing
at
it
surmised
that
by
now
the
bishop
might
have
finished
his
letters
upon
this
thought
she
rose
and
paced
across
the
bright
june
grass
to
the
house
pearls
and
roses
floated
from
the
parlour
her
hand
on
the
doorknob
legrand
paused
irresolutely
for
a
moment
then
lightly
took
it
away
and
crossed
the
hall
to
the
library
a
minute
later
the
bishop
portly
and
fine
letters
in
his
hand
came
down
the
stairs
and
turned
toward
this
room
the
always
hung
he
remembered
by
the
library
escritoire
though
he
was
a
large
man
he
moved
with
great
lightness
he
was
at
once
ponderous
and
easy
miss
serena
at
the
piano
could
hardly
have
heard
him
pass
the
door
so
something
occult
perhaps
made
her
ignore
the
over
the
bar
of
pearls
and
roses
which
she
had
now
reached
she
struck
a
final
chord
rose
closed
the
piano
and
left
the
parlour
chapter
iv
the
convict
my
dear
bishop
exclaimed
legrand
wo
you
come
here
and
talk
to
this
little
girl
to
hagar
answered
the
bishop
what
is
the
trouble
with
hagar
have
you
broken
your
doll
poor
dear
he
came
easily
across
to
the
horsehair
sofa
a
good
man
by
definition
as
ever
was
grieving
you
little
girl
i
think
that
it
is
hagar
who
may
come
to
grieve
others
said
legrand
i
do
not
suppose
it
is
my
business
to
interfere
as
i
should
interfere
were
she
in
my
charge
at
eglantine
but
i
can
not
but
see
in
my
daily
task
how
difficult
it
is
to
eradicate
from
a
youthful
mind
the
stain
that
has
been
left
by
an
improper
book
an
improper
book
what
are
you
doing
hagar
with
an
improper
book
the
bishop
put
out
his
hand
and
took
it
he
looked
at
the
title
and
at
the
author
name
beneath
turned
over
a
dozen
pages
closed
the
book
and
put
it
from
him
on
the
cold
bare
mahogany
table
it
was
not
for
this
that
i
christened
you
he
said
miss
serena
joined
the
group
serena
appealed
legrand
you
think
hagar
ought
to
be
allowed
to
contaminate
her
mind
by
a
book
like
that
miss
serena
looked
that
child
she
been
reading
darwin
a
slow
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
the
book
was
shocking
but
the
truly
shocking
thing
was
how
absolutely
hagar
had
disobeyed
miss
serena
soul
was
soft
as
wax
pliant
as
a
reed
to
the
authorities
her
world
ranged
before
her
by
an
inevitable
reaction
stiffness
showed
in
the
few
cases
where
she
herself
held
the
orb
of
authority
to
be
disobeyed
was
very
grievous
to
her
where
it
was
only
negligence
in
regard
to
some
command
of
her
own
direction
to
a
servant
commands
in
her
class
she
had
often
to
put
up
with
it
though
always
with
a
swelling
sense
of
injury
but
when
things
combined
when
disobedience
to
serena
ashendyne
was
also
disobedience
to
the
constituted
authorities
miss
serena
became
adamant
now
she
looked
at
hagar
with
a
little
gasp
and
then
seeing
through
the
open
door
the
elder
ashendyne
entering
from
the
kitchen
she
called
to
her
mother
come
here
a
moment
if
she
had
said
that
she
was
sorry
pronounced
the
bishop
you
might
forgive
her
i
think
this
time
but
if
she
is
going
to
harden
her
heart
like
that
you
had
best
let
her
see
that
all
sin
in
whatever
degree
brings
suffering
and
i
should
suit
i
think
the
punishment
to
the
offence
hagar
told
me
only
yesterday
that
she
had
rather
read
a
book
than
gather
cherries
or
play
with
dolls
or
go
visiting
or
anything
i
think
i
should
forbid
her
to
open
any
book
at
all
for
a
week
behind
gilead
balm
beyond
the
orchard
and
a
strip
of
meadow
sprang
a
ridge
of
earth
something
more
than
a
hill
something
less
than
a
low
mountain
it
was
safe
dry
warm
and
sandy
too
and
traversed
to
be
popular
with
snakes
too
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
overseer
house
and
the
overseer
dogs
to
be
subject
to
tramps
or
boys
just
wooded
enough
and
furrowed
with
shallow
ravines
to
make
it
to
children
a
romantic
region
when
children
came
to
gilead
balm
as
sometimes
in
the
slow
continuous
procession
through
the
houses
of
a
people
who
traditionally
kept
open
house
they
did
come
hagar
and
they
always
played
freely
and
alone
on
the
side
of
the
ridge
when
the
overseer
grandchildren
too
came
to
visit
him
they
and
hagar
played
here
and
sometimes
mary
magazine
isham
and
at
the
ferry
was
allowed
to
spend
the
day
and
she
and
hagar
played
together
on
the
ridge
hagar
was
very
fond
of
mary
magazine
one
day
having
completed
her
circle
of
flower
dolls
before
her
companion
was
done
she
leaned
back
against
the
apple
tree
beneath
which
the
two
were
seated
and
thoughtfully
regarded
the
brown
face
and
wrapped
hair
mary
magazine

have
been
named

were
named

magdalene
no

an
poured

on
her
han
an
rubbed
jesus
feet
when
mary
magazine
did
come
to
gilead
balm
and
no
children
were
staying
in
the
house
and
the
overseer
grandchildren
were
at
their
home
on
the
other
side
of
the
county
hagar
might
provided
always
she
let
some
one
know
where
she
was
going
hagar
might
play
alone
on
the
ridge
having
asked
the
colonel
if
she
might
she
was
playing
there
alone
playing
was
the
accepted
word
they
always
talked
of
her
as
playing
and
she
herself
repeated
the
word
may
i
go
play
awhile
on
the
ridge
i
reckon
so
gipsy
wear
your
sunbonnet
and
do
get
into
any
mischief
at
the
overseer
house
she
stopped
to
talk
with
green
picking
pease
in
the
garden
mahnin
hagar
said
green
how
yo
ma
this
mahnin
i
think
she
better
green
she
laughed
a
little
this
morning
grandmother
let
me
stay
a
whole
and
mother
talked
about
grandmother
and
about
picking
up
shells
on
the
beach
and
about
a
little
boat
that
she
used
to
go
out
to
sea
in
she
said
that
all
last
night
she
felt
that
boat
beneath
her
she
laughed
and
said
it
felt
like
going
only
hagar
looked
at
green
with
large
wistful
eyes
only
home
really
gilead
balm
of
course
it
is
said
green
cheerfully
she
sat
down
on
an
overturned
bucket
between
the
green
rows
of
pease
and
pushed
back
her
sunbonnet
from
her
kind
old
wrinkled
face
i
remember
when
ma
came
here
jest
as
well
she
was
jest
the
loveliest
thing
but
of
course
all
her
own
people
were
a
good
long
way
off
and
she
was
a
seafarer
herself
and
she
could
somehow
get
used
to
the
hills
heard
her
say
they
jest
shut
her
in
like
a
prison
but
then
after
a
while
you
came
an
i
reckon
though
she
says
things
sometimes
wherever
you
are
she
feels
to
be
home
when
it
comes
to
being
a
woman
the
good
lord
has
to
get
in
somewhere
or
i
do
reckon
none
of
us
could
stand
i
glad
she
better
glad
said
hagar
can
i
help
you
pick
the
pease
mrs
green
thank
you
child
but
i
about
picked
the
mess
you
goin
to
play
on
the
ridge
i
wish
thomasine
and
maggie
and
corker
were
here
to
play
with
you
i
wish
they
were
said
hagar
her
eyes
filled
it
a
very
lonesome
day
yesterday
was
lonesome
and
going
to
be
lonesome
have
you
got
a
good
book
i
never
see
such
a
child
for
books
two
tears
came
out
of
hagar
eyes
i
was
reading
a
book
aunt
serena
told
me
not
to
and
now
i
not
to
read
for
a
whole
week
sho
exclaimed
green
what
did
you
do
that
for
do
you
know
that
little
girls
ought
to
mind
hagar
sighed
yes
i
suppose
they
ought
i
wish
i
had
now
so
lonesome
not
to
read
when
your
mother
sick
and
grandmother
let
me
go
into
the
room
only
just
a
little
while
morning
and
evening
have
you
got
any
pretty
patchwork
nor
nothin
hagar
standing
among
the
blush
roses
looked
at
her
with
sombre
eyes
green
i
hate
to
sew
oh
exclaimed
green
that
an
awful
thing
to
say
she
sat
on
the
overturned
bucket
between
the
peavines
her
friendly
old
face
knobbed
and
wrinkled
like
a
japanese
carving
gleaming
from
between
the
faded
blue
slats
of
her
sunbonnet
and
she
regarded
the
child
before
her
with
real
concern
i
wonder
now
she
said
if
you
goin
to
grow
up
a
rebel
honey
there
ai
a
mite
of
ease
and
comfort
on
that
road
that
what
the
yankees
called
us
all
said
hagar
ah
i
do
mean
said
green
lonelier
and
deeper
ways
of
rebellin
you
do
get
killed
with
an
army
cheerin
you
and
newspapers
goin
into
black
and
a
state
full
of
people
that
were
too
keepin
your
memory
green
what
happens
happens
just
to
you
by
yourself
without
any
company
and
no
wreaths
of
flowers
and
farewell
speeches
they
just
open
the
door
and
put
you
out
out
where
out
by
yourself
out
of
this
earth
favour
and
though
we
think
it
said
green
this
earth
favour
is
our
sunshine
right
hard
to
go
where
there
is
any
sunshine
i
do
know
why
i
talking
like
this
to
you
but
you
a
strange
child
and
always
were
and
i
reckon
you
come
by
it
honest
she
rose
from
among
the
peavines
well
i
been
baking
apple
turnovers
and
they
ai
bad
to
picnic
on
suppose
you
take
a
couple
up
on
the
ridge
with
you
there
grew
on
the
very
top
of
the
ridge
a
cucumber
tree
that
hagar
loved
underneath
was
a
little
fine
sparse
grass
and
enough
pennyroyal
to
make
the
place
aromatic
when
the
sunshine
drew
out
all
its
essence
as
was
the
case
over
the
light
soil
between
the
sprigs
of
pennyroyal
went
a
line
of
ants
carrying
grains
of
some
pale
substance
hagar
watched
them
to
their
hill
when
one
by
one
they
had
entered
a
second
line
of
foragers
emerged
and
went
off
to
the
right
through
the
grass
in
a
little
time
these
too
reappeared
each
carrying
before
her
a
tiny
bead
of
the
amber
stuff
hagar
watched
elbows
on
ground
and
chin
on
hands
she
had
a
feeling
that
they
were
people
and
she
tried
giving
them
names
but
they
were
so
bewilderingly
alike
that
in
a
moment
she
could
not
tell
which
was
brownie
and
which
pixie
and
which
slim
she
turned
upon
her
back
and
lying
in
the
grass
and
pennyroyal
saw
above
her
only
blue
sky
and
blue
sky
she
stared
into
it
if
the
angels
were
sailing
like
the
birds
up
there
and
looking
down
and
looking
down
we
people
might
seem
all
alike
to
them
all
alike
and
not
doing
things
that
were
very
different
all
alike
only
there
are
our
clothes
pink
ones
and
blue
ones
and
white
ones
and
black
ones
and
plaid
ones
and
striped
ones
she
stared
at
the
blue
until
she
seemed
to
see
step
after
step
of
blue
a
great
ladder
leading
up
and
then
she
turned
on
her
side
and
gazed
at
gilead
balm
and
a
mile
away
the
canal
and
the
shining
river
she
could
see
many
windows
but
not
her
mother
window
she
had
to
imagine
that
lonesomeness
and
ennui
that
had
gone
away
for
a
bit
in
the
interest
of
watching
the
ants
returned
full
force
she
stood
up
and
cast
about
for
something
to
break
the
spell
the
apple
turnovers
wrapped
in
a
fringed
napkin
rested
in
a
small
willow
basket
upon
the
grass
hagar
was
not
hungry
but
she
considered
that
she
might
as
well
eat
a
turnover
and
then
that
she
might
as
well
have
a
party
and
ask
a
dozen
flower
dolls
her
twelve
years
were
as
a
moving
plateau
one
side
a
misty
looming
landscape
of
the
mind
older
and
higher
than
her
age
would
forecast
on
the
other
green
hollow
meadows
of
sheer
childhood
her
attention
passed
from
side
to
side
and
now
it
settled
in
the
meadows
she
considered
the
grass
beneath
the
cucumber
tree
for
a
and
then
she
grew
aware
that
she
was
thirsty
and
so
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
would
descend
the
back
side
of
the
ridge
to
the
spring
and
have
the
party
there
crossing
the
hand
breadth
of
level
ground
she
began
to
climb
down
the
long
shady
slope
toward
a
stream
that
trickled
through
a
bit
of
wood
and
a
thicket
and
a
small
spring
in
a
ferny
hollow
the
landscape
river
and
canal
and
fields
and
gilead
balm
with
its
cedars
and
the
garden
and
orchard
and
the
overseer
house
sank
from
view
there
was
only
the
cucumber
tree
against
the
deep
blue
sky
the
trunk
of
the
cucumber
tree
disappeared
and
then
the
greater
branches
and
then
the
lesser
branches
toward
the
top
and
then
the
bushy
green
top
itself
when
hagar
and
the
other
children
played
on
the
ridge
they
followed
her
lead
and
called
this
side
the
far
country
to
them
or
perhaps
only
to
hagar
it
had
a
clime
an
atmosphere
quite
different
from
the
side
when
she
came
to
the
spring
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
she
was
very
thirsty
she
knelt
on
a
great
sunken
rock
and
taking
off
her
sunbonnet
leaned
forward
between
the
fern
and
mint
made
a
cup
of
her
hands
and
drank
the
sparkling
water
when
she
had
had
all
she
wished
she
settled
back
and
regarded
the
green
flowering
thicket
it
came
close
to
the
spring
filling
the
space
between
the
water
and
the
wood
and
it
was
a
wild
luxuriant
tangle
hagar
fancy
began
to
play
with
it
now
it
was
a
fairy
wood
for
thumbelina
now
titania
and
oberon
danced
there
in
the
moonlight
now
her
mind
gave
it
height
and
hugeness
and
it
was
the
wood
around
the
sleeping
beauty
the
minutes
went
by
and
then
she
remembered
the
apple
turnovers
here
was
the
slab
of
rock
for
the
table
she
spread
the
napkin
for
cloth
and
she
laid
blackberry
leaves
for
plates
and
put
the
apple
turnovers
grandly
in
the
middle
then
she
moved
about
the
hollow
and
gathered
her
guests
wild
rose
daisy
susan
elder
white
clover
and
columbine
quite
a
good
party
she
set
each
with
due
ceremony
on
the
flat
rock
before
a
plate
and
then
she
took
her
own
place
facing
the
thicket
and
after
a
polite
little
pause
folded
her
hands
and
closed
her
eyes
we
will
say
she
said
a
silent
grace
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
opened
them
full
upon
other
eyes
haggard
wolfishly
hungry
eyes
looking
at
her
from
out
the
thicket
behind
them
a
body
striped
like
a
wasp
i
did
mean
to
scare
you
said
the
boy
but
if
you
ever
went
most
of
two
days
and
a
night
without
anything
to
eat
you
know
how
it
felt
i
never
did
said
hagar
but
i
can
imagine
it
i
wish
i
had
asked
green
for
apple
turnovers
as
she
spoke
she
pushed
the
red
fringed
napkin
with
the
second
turnover
toward
him
eat
that
one
too
i
truly
do
want
any
and
the
flowers
are
never
hungry
he
bit
into
the
second
turnover
it
seems
mean
to
eat
up
your
but
i
dead
and
that
the
truth
hagar
sitting
on
the
great
stone
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
her
sunbonnet
back
on
her
shoulders
watched
her
suddenly
acquired
guest
he
would
not
come
clear
out
of
the
thicket
the
tangled
growth
held
him
all
but
head
and
shoulders
i
believe
i
seen
you
before
she
said
at
last
about
two
weeks
ago
grandfather
and
aunt
serena
and
i
were
on
the
were
you
at
the
lock
up
the
river
the
boat
went
down
and
down
until
you
were
standing
up
just
against
the
sky
i
am
almost
sure
it
was
you
he
reddened
yes
it
was
me
then
dropping
the
arm
that
held
the
yet
uneaten
bit
of
turnover
he
broke
out
i
did
run
away
while
i
was
a
trusty
i
would
have
done
it
one
of
the
men
lied
about
me
and
said
dirty
words
about
my
people
and
i
jumped
on
him
and
knocked
his
head
against
a
stone
until
he
did
come
to
for
half
an
hour
then
they
did
things
to
me
and
did
what
they
called
degrading
me
more
trustying
for
you
said
the
boss
so
i
run
away
three
days
ago
he
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
sleeve
it
seems
more
like
three
years
i
reckon
they
got
the
dogs
out
what
have
they
got
the
dogs
out
for
why
to
hunt
me
i
i
his
voice
sunk
terror
came
back
and
fear
a
chill
nausea
and
swooning
of
the
soul
he
groaned
and
half
rose
from
the
thicket
i
was
lying
here
till
night
but
i
reckon
i
better
be
going
his
eyes
fell
upon
his
body
and
he
sank
back
o
god
i
reckon
in
hell
we
wear
these
clothes
hagar
stared
at
him
faint
reflecting
lines
of
anxiety
and
unhappiness
on
her
brow
quiverings
about
her
lips
ought
you
to
have
run
away
was
it
right
to
run
away
the
colour
flooded
her
face
it
was
always
hard
for
her
to
tell
of
her
errors
but
she
felt
that
she
and
the
boy
were
in
somewhat
the
same
case
and
that
she
ought
to
do
it
i
did
something
my
aunt
had
told
me
not
to
do
it
was
reading
a
book
that
she
said
was
wicked
i
ca
see
yet
that
it
was
wicked
it
was
very
interesting
but
the
bishop
said
that
he
did
christen
me
for
that
and
that
it
was
a
sin
and
now
for
a
whole
week
grandmother
says
that
i
not
to
read
any
book
at
all
which
is
very
hard
what
i
mean
is
said
hagar
though
i
do
feel
yet
that
there
was
anything
wicked
in
that
book
i
did
read
much
of
it
i
feel
perfectly
certain
that
i
ought
to
obey
grandmother
the
bible
tells
you
so
and
i
believe
in
the
bible
her
brow
puckered
again
at
least
i
believe
that
i
believe
in
the
bible
and
if
there
was
anybody
in
the
house
and
the
most
interesting
books
were
lying
around
i
would
at
least
i
think
i
would
touch
one
till
the
week
is
over
she
tried
earnestly
to
explain
her
position
i
mean
that
if
i
really
did
wrong
and
i
reckon
i
have
to
say
that
i
ought
to
have
disobeyed
aunt
serena
though
the
bible
does
say
anything
about
aunts
i
take
the
hard
things
that
come
after
of
course
she
ended
politely
your
folks
may
have
been
mistaken
and
you
may
not
have
done
anything
wrong
at
all
the
boy
bloomed
at
her
i
tell
you
what
i
did
i
live
out
in
the
mountains
the
other
end
of
nowhere
well
christmas
there
was
a
dance
in
the
cove
and
i
went
but
nancy
horn
that
had
promised
to
go
with
me
broke
her
word
and
went
with
dave
windless
there
was
a
lot
of
apple
jack
around
and
i
took
more
i
usually
take
and
then
when
we
were
dancing
the
reel
somebody
and
i
swear
still
it
was
dave
though
he
swore
in
the
it
was
dave
windless
put
out
his
foot
and
tripped
me
up
well
nancy
she
laughed
i
do
remember
anything
clear
after
that
and
i
thought
that
the
man
who
was
shooting
up
the
room
was
some
other
person
though
i
did
think
it
was
funny
the
pistol
was
in
my
hand
anyhow
dave
got
a
ball
through
his
hip
and
old
daddy
jake
willy
that
i
was
awful
fond
of
and
would
have
hurt
not
for
a
still
of
my
own
and
the
best
horse
on
the
mountain
he
got
his
bow
arm
broken
and
one
of
the
women
was
frightened
into
fits
and
next
week
when
her
baby
was
born
and
had
a
harelip
she
said
i
done
it
anyhow
the
sheriff
came
and
took
me
it
was
about
dawn
up
on
the
and
i
still
thought
it
was
another
man
going
away
toward
catamount
gap
and
the
next
county
where
there
was
any
nancy
horn
i
thought
so
clear
till
i
fired
at
the
sheriff
and
broke
his
elbow
and
the
deputy
came
up
behind
and
twisted
the
pistol
away
and
somebody
else
threw
a
gourd
of
water
from
the
spring
over
me
and
i
come
to
and
found
it
had
been
me
all
the
time
that
what
i
did
and
i
got
four
years
four
years
said
hagar
four
years
in
in
jail
in
the
penitentiary
said
the
boy
it
a
worse
word
than
jail
i
know
what
right
and
wrong
liquor
wrong
and
the
judge
said
carrying
concealed
weapons
was
wrong
and
i
reckon
it
is
though
there
is
much
concealment
when
everybody
knows
you
wearing
them
yes
liquor
wrong
and
quarrels
might
go
off
just
with
some
words
and
using
your
fists
if
powder
and
shot
were
right
under
your
hand
tempting
you
yes
drinking
wrong
and
quarreling
wrong
and
after
i
come
to
my
senses
it
did
need
no
preacher
like
those
that
come
round
sundays
to
tell
me
that
but
i
tell
you
what
the
whole
floor
space
of
hell
wronger
than
most
of
the
things
men
do
and
that
the
place
the
lawyers
and
the
judges
and
the
juries
send
men
to
do
you
mean
that
they
ought
to
to
do
anything
to
you
you
do
wrong
no
i
do
mean
that
said
the
boy
i
got
good
sense
if
i
did
see
it
at
first
old
daddy
jake
willy
came
to
the
county
jail
three
or
four
times
and
he
made
me
see
it
the
judge
and
the
lawyer
could
ha
made
me
see
it
but
did
and
at
last
i
was
willing
to
go
his
face
worked
the
day
before
i
was
to
go
i
was
in
that
cell
i
stayed
in
then
two
months
and
i
looked
right
out
into
the
sunshine
you
could
see
old
rocky
knob
between
two
bars
and
den
between
two
and
lonely
river
running
down
into
the
valley
between
the
other
two
and
the
sun
shining
over
everything
shining
just
like
it
shining
well
i
stood
there
looking
out
and
made
a
good
resolution
i
was
going
to
take
what
was
coming
to
me
because
i
deserved
it
having
broken
the
peace
and
lamed
men
and
hurt
a
woman
and
broken
daddy
jake
arm
and
fired
at
the
sheriff
i
had
meant
to
do
all
that
but
still
i
had
done
it
so
i
said
take
it
and
i
wo
give
any
trouble
and
i
keep
the
rules
if
it
a
place
to
make
men
better
in
i
come
out
a
better
man
i
work
just
as
hard
as
any
man
and
if
there
books
to
study
i
study
and
i
keep
the
rules
and
try
to
help
other
people
and
when
i
come
out
i
be
young
still
and
a
better
man
he
rose
to
his
full
height
in
the
thicket
the
upper
half
of
his
striped
body
showing
like
a
swimmer
above
the
matted
green
he
sent
out
his
young
arms
in
a
wide
gesture
at
once
mocking
and
despairing
but
whether
addressed
to
earth
or
heaven
was
not
apparent
you
see
i
did
know
any
more
about
that
place
than
a
baby
unborn
with
that
he
dropped
like
a
stone
back
into
the
thicket
and
lay
dumb
and
close
with
agonized
eyes
around
the
base
of
the
ridge
out
of
the
wood
came
the
dogs
behind
them
three
men
with
guns
one
of
the
men
was
a
jolly
fatherly
kind
of
person
he
tried
to
explain
to
hagar
that
they
were
really
going
to
hurt
the
convict
at
all
she
saw
for
herself
that
the
dogs
had
hurt
him
not
a
mite
the
handcuffs
did
hurt
him
either
they
were
loose
and
comfortable
no
they
were
going
to
do
anything
to
him
they
were
just
going
to
take
him
he
had
hurt
her
had
he
had
said
anything
disagreeable
to
her
or
done
anything
but
eat
up
her
then
that
was
all
right
and
the
fatherly
person
would
go
himself
with
her
to
the
house
and
tell
the
colonel
about
it
of
course
he
knew
the
colonel
everybody
knew
the
colonel
and
stop
crying
little
lady
that
boy
ai
worth
it
the
colonel
dictum
was
that
the
country
was
getting
so
damned
unsettled
that
hagar
must
not
again
be
let
to
play
on
the
ridge
alone
old
miss
who
had
had
that
morning
a
somewhat
longish
talk
with
bude
stated
that
she
would
tell
mary
green
to
send
for
thomasine
and
maggie
and
corker
bude
thinks
the
child
broods
too
much
and
it
may
be
better
to
have
healthy
diversion
for
her
in
case
in
case
exclaimed
miss
serena
does
he
really
think
mother
that
it
serious
i
do
think
he
knows
answered
her
mother
i
do
think
it
is
myself
but
maria
was
never
like
anybody
else
dear
maria
said
legrand
she
should
have
made
such
a
brilliant
lovely
woman
if
only
there
was
a
little
more
compliance
more
feminine
sweetness
more
if
i
may
say
so
unselfishness
where
asked
the
bishop
is
medway
ashendyne
needles
clicked
my
son
was
in
spain
the
last
we
heard
studying
the
painter
murillo
chapter
v
maria
thomasine
and
maggie
and
corker
arrived
and
filled
the
overseer
house
with
noise
they
were
a
blatantly
healthful
boisterous
set
only
thomasine
showing
gleams
of
quiet
they
wanted
at
once
to
play
on
the
ridge
but
now
hagar
would
play
on
the
ridge
she
said
she
like
it
any
more
as
she
spoke
her
thin
shoulders
drew
together
and
her
eyes
also
and
two
vertical
lines
appeared
between
these
what
you
shakin
for
asked
corker
got
a
chill
so
they
played
down
by
the
branch
where
the
willows
grew
or
in
the
old
disused
or
in
the
orchard
or
about
a
haystack
on
a
hillside
corker
wanted
always
to
play
robbers
or
going
to
sea
maggie
liked
to
jump
from
the
haystack
or
to
swing
swing
swing
holding
to
the
long
pendant
green
withes
of
the
weeping
willow
or
to
climb
the
apple
trees
thomasine
liked
to
make
dams
across
the
streamlet
below
the
she
liked
to
shape
wet
clay
and
she
saved
every
pebble
or
bit
of
bright
china
or
broken
blue
or
green
glass
with
which
to
decorate
a
small
grotto
they
were
making
she
also
liked
to
play
and
to
hunt
for
clovers
hagar
liked
to
play
going
to
sea
but
she
did
not
care
for
robbers
she
liked
to
swing
from
the
willows
and
to
climb
a
particular
apple
tree
which
she
loved
but
she
did
not
want
to
jump
from
the
haystack
nor
to
climb
all
trees
she
liked
almost
everything
that
thomasine
liked
but
she
was
not
so
terribly
fond
of
in
her
own
likings
she
found
herself
somewhat
lonely
none
of
the
three
though
thomasine
more
than
the
others
cared
much
for
a
book
they
would
rather
have
a
any
day
when
it
came
to
lying
on
the
hillside
without
speaking
and
watching
the
clouds
and
the
they
did
not
care
for
that
at
all
however
when
they
were
tired
and
everything
else
failed
they
did
like
hagar
to
tell
them
a
story
aladdin
they
liked
sitting
in
the
shadow
of
the
haystack
their
chins
on
their
hands
eyes
still
unconsciously
alert
for
clovers
corker
with
a
june
apple
trying
to
determine
whether
he
would
bite
into
it
now
or
wait
until
aladdin
mother
had
uncovered
the
jewels
before
the
sultan
they
liked
aladdin
and
queen
gulnare
and
prince
beder
and
snow
white
and
rose
red
and
then
came
the
day
that
they
went
after
raspberries
that
morning
hagar
turning
the
doorknob
of
her
mother
room
found
the
door
softly
opened
from
within
and

the
threshold
phoebe

no

the
bishop
appearing
at
the
stair
foot
she
turned
to
greet
him
hagar
slipping
from
her
touch
stole
down
the
hall
to
old
miss
chamber
and
tried
the
door
it
gave
and
let
her
in
old
miss
was
seated
in
the
big
chair
bude
and
the
colonel
were
standing
on
either
side
of
the
hearth
and
miss
serena
was
between
them
and
the
door
hagar
exclaimed
miss
serena
do
come
in
now
dear
grandmother
and
i
will
be
out
to
breakfast
in
a
moment
but
hagar
had
the
courage
of
unhappiness
and
groping
and
fear
for
the
most
loved
she
fled
straight
to
bude
bude
oh
bude
is
my
mother
going
to
die
no
bude
said
the
colonel
from
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
bude
an
able
country
doctor
loved
and
honoured
devoted
and
fatherly
and
wise
made
a
tchk
with
his
tongue
against
the
roof
of
his
mouth
old
miss
leaving
the
big
chair
came
and
took
hagar
and
drew
her
back
with
her
into
the
deep
chintz
hollows
no
one
might
doubt
that
old
miss
loved
her
granddaughter
now
her
clasp
was
as
stately
as
ever
but
her
voice
was
quite
gentle
though
of
course
authoritative
else
it
could
not
have
belonged
to
old
miss
your
mother
had
a
bad
night
dear
and
so
to
make
her
quiet
and
comfortable
we
sent
early
for
bude
she
is
going
to
sleep
now
and
you
shall

but
you
can
only
go
if
you
are
a
good
obedient
child

away
and
get
your
breakfast
and
you
and
thomasine
and
maggie
and
corker

raspberrying
bude
spoke
from
the
braided
rug
no
one
knows
hagar
going
to
happen
in
this
old
world
do
they
but
nature
has
a
way
of
taking
care
of
people
quite
regardless
and
without
waiting
to
consult
the
doctors
i
watched
nature
right
closely
and
i
never
give
up
anything
your
mother
right
ill
my
dear
but
so
have
a
lot
of
other
people
been
right
ill
and
gotten
well
you
go
pick
your
raspberries
and
maybe
you
can
see
her
ca
i
see
her
well

maybe
said
the
doctor
the
raspberry
patches
were
almost
two
miles
away
past
a
number
of
shaggy
hills
and
dales
a
wood
road
led
that
way
and
hagar
and
thomasine
and
maggie
and
corker
with
jinnie
a
coloured
woman
to
take
care
of
them
felt
the
damp
leaf
mould
under
their
feet
a
breeze
coming
through
oak
and
pine
tossed
their
hair
and
fluttered
the
skirts
and
the
broad
collar
of
corker
voluminous
shirt
the
sky
was
bright
blue
with
two
or
three
large
clouds
like
sailing
vessels
with
all
sail
on
a
sang
to
split
its
throat
they
saw
a
black
snake
and
a
rabbit
showed
a
white
tip
of
tail
and
a
pine
with
a
large
empty
in
the
topmost
crotch
ineffably
lonely
and
deserted
against
the
deep
sky
engaged
their
attention
they
had
various
adventures
each
of
the
children
carried
a
tin
bucket
for
berries
and
jinnie
carried
a
split
basket
with
dinner
in
it
sandwiches
and
rusks
and
a
jar
with
milk
and
snowball
cakes
they
were
going
to
stay
all
day
that
was
what
usually
they
loved
it
was
so
adventurous
corker
strode
along
whistling
maggie
whistled
too
as
well
as
a
boy
though
he
looked
disdain
at
her
and
said
huh
girls
ca
whistle
dar
a
piece
of
poetry
i
done

jinnie

thomasine
hummed
as
she
walked
she
had
filled
her
bucket
with
various
matters
as
she
went
along
and
now
she
was
engaged
in
fashioning
out
of
the
green
burrs
of
the
burdock
a
basket
with
an
elaborate
handle
do
you
want
some
burrs
she
asked
hagar
walking
beside
her
thomasine
was
always
considerate
and
would
give
away
almost
anything
she
had
hagar
took
the
burrs
and
began
also
to
make
a
basket
she
was
being
good
and
indeed
as
the
moments
passed
the
heavy
painful
feeling
about
her
heart
went
away
the
doctor
had
said
and
grandmother
had
said
and
uncle
bob
and
phoebe
and
every
one
the
raspberries
she
instantly
visualized
one
of
the
blue
willow
saucers
filled
with
raspberries
carried
in
by
herself
to
her
mother
at
yarrow
was
in
bloom
and
susans
and
the
tall
white
jerusalem
candles
coming
back
she
would
gather
a
big
bouquet
for
the
grey
jar
on
her
mother
table
she
grew
a
bronze
butterfly
fluttered
before
her
the
heavy
odour
of
the
pine
filled
her
nostrils
the
sky
was
so
blue
the
air
so
sweet
there
was
a
pearly
cloud
like
a
castle
and
another
like
a
little
boat
a
little
boat
off
went
her
fancy
swing
low
sweet
chariot
sang
jinnie
as
she
walked
the
raspberry
patches
were
in
sunny
hollows
there
was
a
stream
running
pure
over
a
gravel
bed
and
a
hillside
green
and
as
velvet
and
deep
woods
closing
in
shutting
out
summer
sunshine
bathed
every
grass
blade
and
berry
leaf
summer
winds
cooled
the
air
bees
and
grasshoppers
and
birds
squirrels
in
the
woods
rippling
water
wind
in
the
leaves
made
summer
sounds
it
was
a
happy
day
sometimes
hagar
thomasine
maggie
corker
and
jinnie
picked
berries
from
the
same
bush
sometimes
they
scattered
and
combined
in
twos
and
threes
sometimes
each
established
a
corner
and
picked
in
an
elfin
solitude
sometimes
they
conversed
or
bubbled
over
with
laughter
sometimes
they
kept
a
serious
silence
it
was
a
matter
of
rivalry
as
to
whose
bucket
should
first
be
filled
hagar
strayed
off
at
last
to
an
angle
of
an
old
rail
fence
the
berries
as
she
found
were
very
fine
here
she
called
the
news
to
the
others
but
they
said
they
had
fine
bushes
too
and
so
she
picked
on
with
a
world
of
her
own
about
her
the
droned
and
droned
her
fingers
moved
slower
and
slower
at
last
she
stopped
picking
and
lying
down
on
a
sunken
rock
by
the
fence
fell
to
dreaming
her
dreams
were
already
shot
with
thought
and
she
was
apt
when
she
seemed
most
idle
to
be
silently
inwardly
growing
now
she
was
thinking
about
heaven
and
about
god
she
was
a
great
committer
of
poetry
to
memory
and
now
while
she
lay
filtering
sand
through
her
hands
as
through
an
hourglass
she
said
over
a
stanza
hard
to
learn
which
yet
she
had
learned
some
days
ago
trailing
clouds
of
glory
do
we
come
from
god
who
is
our
home
when
she
had
repeated
it
dreamily
in
an
inward
whisper
the
problem
of
why
in
that
case
she
was
so
far
from
home
engaged
her
attention
the
here
and
the
there
god
away
away
off
on
a
throne
with
angels
and
hagar
ashendyne
in
a
blue
sunbonnet
here
by
a
virginia
rail
fence
with
raspberry
stain
on
her
hands
was
where
you
lived
god
was
everywhere
then
was
god
right
here
too
but
hagar
ashendyne
see
the
throne
and
the
gold
steps
and
floor
and
the
angels
she
could
make
a
picture
of
them
just
as
she
could
of
solomon
throne
or
pharaoh
throne
or
queen
victoria
throne
but
the
picture
stir
anything
at
her
heart
she
was
homesick
for
the
court
she
was
homesick
to
be
a
good
woman
when
she
grew
up
and
to
learn
all
the
time
and
to
know
beautiful
things
but
she
was
homesick
for
heaven
where
god
lived
then
was
she
wicked
hagar
wondered
and
wondered
the
yellow
sand
dropped
from
between
her
palms
god
in
the
sand
god
in
me
god
here
and
now
then
god
also
is
trying
to
grow
more
god
hagar
drew
a
great
sigh
and
for
the
moment
gave
it
up
before
her
on
the
grey
rail
was
a
slender
burnished
insect
all
armour
around
the
lock
of
the
fence
came
like
a
moving
stiletto
a
lizard
which
took
and
devoured
the
insect
god
in
the
lizard
god
in
the
insect
god
devouring
god
making
himself
feed
himself
growing
so
the
sun
suddenly
left
the
grass
and
the
raspberry
bushes
a
cloud
had
hidden
it
other
cloud
masses
here
pearly
white
here
somewhat
dark
were
boiling
up
from
the
horizon
jinnie
called
the
children
together

no

i
going
to
the
was
dark
and
somewhat
dirty
but
they
found
a
tolerable
square
yard
or
two
of
earthen
floor
and
they
all
sat
close
together
for
warmth
the
air
having
grown
quite
cold
and
for
company
a
thunderstorm
after
all
being
a
thing
that
made
even
train
robbers
and
castled
barons
feel
rather
small
and
helpless
for
an
hour
lightnings
flashed
and
thunders
rolled
and
the
rain
fell
in
leaden
lines
then
the
lightnings
grew
less
frequent
and
vivid
and
the
thunder
travelled
farther
away
but
the
rain
still
fell
oh
it
so
stupid
and
dark
in
here
said
corker

little
robber
girl
hut
in
the
when
all
were
asleep
save
gerda
and
the
little
robber
girl
and
the
reindeer
when
they
came
to
the
reindeer
corker
said
he

behind

in

jinnie
called
out
whoa

till

and
they
all
drew
closer
together
with
a
shudder
of
delight
the
clouds
were
breaking
the
lines
of
rain
were
silver
instead
of
leaden
even
the
was
lighter
inside
there
was
no
reindeer
after
all
there
were
only
brown
logs
and
trampled
earth
and
nests
and
a
big
spider
web

traveller
of

thousand
years
through
heated
forests
was
fearsome
enough
ugh
said
the
children
and
shivered
and
it
took
the
sun
indeed
to
drive
the
creeping
mistlike
thoughts
away
going
home
through
the
woodland
hagar
began
to
gather
flowers
her
bucket
of
berries
on
her
arm
she
stepped
aside
for
this
bloom
and
that
gathering
with
long
stems
making
a
sheaf
of
blossoms
what

hagar
kept
on
plucking
susans
and
cardinal
flowers
and
purple
clover
and
they
came
in
the
afternoon
glow
in
sight
of
gilead
balm
they
came
closer
until
the
house
was
large
standing
between
its
dark
funereal
cedars
with
a
rosy
cloud
behind
all
the
blinds
are
closed
as
though
we
gone
away
said
hagar
i
never
saw
it
that
way
before
green
was
at
the
lower
gate
waiting
for
them
her
old
kind
wrinkled
face
was
pale
between
the
slats
of
her
sunbonnet
but
her
eyelids
were
reddened
as
though
she
had
been
weeping

chapter
vi
eglantine
no
one
could
be
so
as
to
deny
that
eglantine
was
a
sweet
place
it
lay
sweetly
on
just
the
right
softly
swelling
hill
the
old
main
house
had
a
sweet
porch
with
wistaria
growing
sweetly
over
it
the
long
added
wings
had
pink
and
white
roses
growing
sweetly
on
trellises
between
the
windows
there
were
silver
maples
and
heavily
blooming
locust
trees
and
three
fine
magnolias
there
were
thickets
of
weigelia
and
spir√¶a
and
forsythia
and
winding
walks
and
an
arbour
and
the
whole
twenty
acres
or
so
was
enclosed
by
a
thorny
hedge
almost
though
not
quite
so
high
as
the
hedge
around
the
sleeping
beauty
palace
it
was
a
sweet
place
everyone
said
so
parents
and
guardians
the
town
that
neighboured
eglantine
tourists
that
drove
by
visitors
to
the
commencement
exercises
everybody
the
girls
themselves
said
so
it
was
praised
of
all
almost
all
the
place
was
sweet
morel
the
french
teacher
who
was
always
improving
his
english
and
so
on
the
hunt
for
synonyms
once
said
in
company
that
it
was
saccharine
miss
carlisle
who
taught
ancient
and
modern
history
and
in
the
interstices
astronomy
and
a
physiology
gently
corrected
him
oh
morel
we
never
use
that
word
in
this
sense
if
you
wish
to
vary
the
term
you
might
use
or
or
besides
she
gazed
across
the
lawn
it
is
so
sweet
i
always
think
in
november
as
it
is
in
april
or
may
the
sweetest
time
i
think
said
miss
bedford
who
taught
mathematics
geography
and
latin
is
when
the
lilac
is
in
bloom
and
when
the
robins
nest
again
sighed
a
pensive
widowed
lane
who
taught
the
little
girls
it
is
always
said
morel
november
or
april

ze
difference

remarked
miss
gage
who
taught
philosophy
here
is
mrs
legrand
all
rose
to
greet
the
mistress
of
eglantine
as
she
came
out
from
the
hall
upon
the
broad
porch
legrand
graciously
ample
form
was
wrapped
in
black
cashmere
and
black
lace
her
face
was
unwrinkled
but
her
hair
had
rapidly
whitened
it
was
piled
upon
her
head
after
an
agreeable
fashion
and
crowned
by
a
graceful
small
cap
of
lace
she
was
ample
and
creamy
and
refinedly
despotic
with
her
came
her
sylvie
maine
it
was
early
november
and
the
sycamores
were
yet
bronze
the
maples
aflame
it
was
late
friday
afternoon
and
the
occasion
the
arrival
and
entertainment
overnight
of
an
english
writer
of
note
a
woman
visiting
america
with
a
book
in
mind
legrand
said
that
she
had
thought
she
heard
the
carriage
wheels
pollock
the
said
no
it
was
the
wind
down
the
avenue
legrand
pleasantly
just
condescending
enough
and
not
too
condescending
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
group
morel
and
pollock
and
you
miss
carlisle
and
miss
bedford
will
i
hope

supper
with
our
guest
and
me
sylvie
here

her
usual
place
i
ca

she
spoils
me
and
i

this
month
in
her
classes

miss
gage
hagar
ashendyne
mrs
legrand
legrand
had
a
humorous
smile
then
sylvie
see
that
dress
is
all
right
and
try
to
get
her
to
do
her
hair
differently
i
like
eglantine
girls
to
look
their
birth
and
place
dear
cousin
olivia
said
sylvie
who
was
extremely
pretty
for
all
her
plainness
hagar
got
distinction
but
legrand
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
could
see
it
a
little
wind
arising
all
the
place
became
a
whirl
of
coloured
leaves
and
now
the
carriage
wheels
were
surely
heard
half
an
hour
later
sylvie
went
up
to
hagar
room
it
was
what
was
called
the
tower
room
small
and
high
up
too
small
for
anything
but
a
single
bed
and
one
inmate
it
was
a
popular
room
with
the
eglantine
girls
a
room
without
a
roommate
was
bad
enough
and
then
when
it
was
upon
another
floor
quite
away
from
every
one
language
failed
but
hagar
ashendyne
liked
it
and
it
had
been
hers
for
three
years
she
had
been
at
eglantine
for
three
years
going
home
to
gilead
balm
each
summer
she
was
eighteen
old
for
her
age
and
young
for
her
age
sylvie
found
her
curled
in
the
and
spoke
twice
before
she
made
her
hear
hagar
come
back
to
earth
hagar
unfolded
her
long
limbs
and
pushed
her
hair
away
from
her
eyes
i
was
travelling
she
said
i
was
crossing
the
desert
of
sahara
with
a
caravan
you
are
remarked
sylvie
too
funny
for
words
you
and
i
are
to
take
supper
with
michael
a
red
came
into
hagar
cheek
are
we
did
legrand
say
so
yes
hagar
lit
the
lamp
michael
michael
sylvie
you
rather
use
your
own
name
if
you
wrote
oh
i
do
know
answered
sylvie
vaguely
what
dress
are
you
going
to
wear
i
have
any
but
the
green
then
wear
your
deep
lace
collar
with
it
cousin
olivia
wants
you
to
look
as
nice
as
possible
do
you
want
me
to
do
your
hair
hagar
placed
the
lamp
upon
the
wooden
slab
of
a
small
that
done
she
stood
and
looked
at
herself
with
a
curious
wistful
puckering
of
the
lips
sylvie
prinking
and
fixing
up
does
suit
me
do
you
like
people
to
like
you
yes
i
do
i
like
it
so
much
it
must
be
a
sin
only
not
very
many
people
do
and
i
do
think
prinking
helps
yes
it
does
if
you
look
pretty
how
can
people
help
liking
you
three
fourths
the
battle
hagar
fell
to
considering
it
is
it
but
then
we
do
all
think
the
same
thing
pretty
or
ugly
the
red
showed
again
like
wine
beneath
her
smooth
dark
skin
sylvie
i
to
be
beautiful
i
like
to
be
as
beautiful
as
beatrix
esmond
i
like
to
be
as
beautiful
as
helen
of
troy
but
everybody
at
eglantine
thinks
i
am
ugly
and
i
suppose
i
am
she
looked
wistfully
at
sylvie
now
in
the
back
of
sylvie
head
there
was
certainly
the
thought
that
hagar
ought
to
have
said
i
like
to
be
as
beautiful
as
you
sylvie
but
sylvie
had
a
sweet
temper
and
she
was
not
unmagnanimous
i
should
call
you
ugly
she
said
judicially
you
are
pretty
and
i
do
believe
any
one
would
ever
call
you
so
but
you
are
at
all
disagreeably
plain
you
got
something
that
makes
people
ask
who
you
are
i
would
worry
oh
i
was
worrying
said
hagar
i
was
only
wear
the
lace
collar
she
took
it
out
of
a
black
japanned
box
and
with
it
the
topaz
brooch
that
had
been
her
mother
the
visitor
from
england
found
the
large
square
eglantine
parlour
an
interesting
room
the
framed
in
sallow
gilt
the
chandelier
the
old
velvet
carpet
strewn
with
large
soft
roses
the
furniture
the
two
or
three
portraits
of
powdered
colonial
gentlemen
the
bits
of
old
china
the
framed
letters
bearing
signatures
that
seemed
to
float
to
her
from
out
her
old
united
states
history
all
came
to
her
like
a
vague
fragrance
from
some
unusual
old
garden
and
then
curiously
superimposed
upon
all
this
appeared
memorials
of
four
catastrophic
years
soldiers
and
statesmen
of
the
confederacy
had
found
no
time
in
which
to
have
their
portraits
painted
but
legrand
had
much
of
family
piety
and
in
addition
daguerreotypes
and
de
of
the
dead
and
gone
with
her
first
glow
of
prosperity
she
had
a
local
artist
paint
her
father
from
a
daguerreotype
stalwart
with
a
high
roman
face
he
looked
forth
in
black
broadcloth
with
a
roll
of
parchment
in
his
hand
the
next
year
she
had
had
her
husband
painted
in
his
grey
brigadier
uniform
her
two
brothers
followed
and
then
a
famous
kinsman
all
dead
and
gone
all
slain
in
battle
the
portraits
were
not
masterpieces
but
there
they
were
in
the
pathos
of
the
grey
underneath
each
a
little
gilt
plate
killed
at
sharpsburg
killed
leading
a
charge
in
the
wilderness
killed
at
cold
harbour
upon
the
wall
against
the
pale
paper
hung
crossed
swords
and
cavalry
pistols
and
there
were
framed
commissions
and
battle
orders
and
an
empty
shell
propped
open
the
wide
door
the
english
visitor
found
it
all
strange
and
interesting
it
was
as
though
a
fragrance
of
dried
contended
with
a
whiff
of
gunpowder
the
small
into
which
presently
she
was
carried
had
fascinating
prints
pocahontas
baptized
and
pocahontas
married
and
a
group
of
women
with
children
and
several
negroes
gathered
about
an
open
grave
one
woman
standing
out
reading
the
burial
roger
michael
was
so
interested
that
she
would
have
liked
not
to
talk
at
all
just
to
sit
and
look
at
the
prints
and
mark
the
negro
servants
passing
about
the
table
but
legrand
agreeable
voice
was
asking
about
the
health
of
the
queen
she
bestirred
herself
to
be
an
acceptable
guest
the
small
was
separated
only
by
an
archway
from
the
large
and
into
the
latter
in
orderly
files
came
the
eglantine
pupils
wound
about
to
their
several
tables
and
seated
themselves
with
demureness
morel
was
speaking
of
the
friendship
of
france
and
england
roger
michael
while
she
appeared
to
listen
studied
these
american
girls
these
southern
girls
she
found
many
of
them
pretty
even
lovely
not
emphatically
with
the
english
beauty
of
skin
not
with
the
colour
of
new
england
girls
among
whom
recently
she
had
been
not
with
the
stronger
frame
that
was
coming
in
with
this
generation
of
admission
to
exercise
the
certain
boyish
alertness
and
poise
that
more
and
more
she
was
seeing
exhibited
but
pretty
or
lovely
with
delicacy
and
a
certain
languor
a
dim
sweetness
of
expression
and
precious
trove
in
america
voices
that
pleased
she
noted
exceptions
to
type
small
swarthy
girls
and
large
overgrown
ones
girls
that
were
manifestly
robust
girls
that
were
alert
girls
that
were
daring
girls
that
were
timid
or
stupid
or
simply
an√¶mic
girls
that
approached
the
english
type
and
girls
that
were
at
the
very
antipodes
but
the
general
impression
was
of
farther
south
than
she
had
as
yet
gone
in
america
of
more
grace
and
slowness
manner
and
sweetness
their
clothes
interested
her
they
were
so
much
more
dressed
than
they
would
have
been
in
england
evidently
in
deference
to
the
smaller
room
there
was
an
added
control
of
speech
there
sounded
no
more
than
a
pleasant
hum
a
soft
indistinguishable
murmur
of
young
voices
they
are
so
excited
over
the
prospect
of
your
speaking
to
them
after
supper
said
legrand
her
hand
upon
the
coffee
cream
and
sugar
they
do
not
seem
excited
thought
roger
sugar
thank
you
no
cream
of
what
shall
i
talk
to
them
in
what
are
they
especially
interested
in
your
charming
books
i
should
say
answered
legrand
in
how
you
write
them
and
in
the
authors
you
must
know
and
then
your
sweet
english
life
stratford
and
canterbury
and
devonshire
we
have
been
reading
doone
aloud
this
month
said
miss
carlisle
and
the
girls
very
cleverly
arranged
a
little
play
sylvie
here
played
lorna
beautifully
roger
michael
smiled
across
at
hagar
two
or
three
places
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
i
should
like
to
have
seen
it
she
said
in
her
good
deep
english
voice
oh
said
hagar
i
not
sylvie
i
played
lizzie
this
is
my
little
cousin
and
sylvie
maine
said
legrand
and
this
is
hagar
ashendyne
the
granddaughter
of
an
old
friend
and
connection
of
my
family
said
roger
michael
i
remember
meeting
once
in
the
south
of
france
a
southerner
a
medway
ashendyne
indeed
exclaimed
legrand
then
you
have
met
hagar
father
medway
ashendyne
he
is
a
great
traveller
we
do
not
see
as
much
of
him
as
we
should
like
to
see
do
we
hagar
i
have
not
seen
him
said
hagar
since
i
was
a
little
girl
her
voice
though
low
was
strange
and
vibrant
what
here
thought
roger
michael
but
what
she
said
was
only
he
was
a
very
pleasant
gentleman
very
handsome
very
cultivated
my
friends
and
i
were
thrown
with
him
during
a
day
at
carcassonne
a
month
afterwards
we
met
him
at
he
was
sketching
quite
wonderfully
legrand
inwardly
deplored
medway
ashendyne
daughter
lack
of
to
give
herself
away
like
that
just
the
kind
of
thing
her
mother
used
to
do
aloud
she
said
medway
a
great
wanderer
but
one
of
these
days
he
will
come
home
and
settle
down
and
we
all
be
happy
together
i
remember
him
as
a
young
man
a
perfectly
fascinating
young
dinah
bring
more
waffles
yes
if
you
will
tell
our
girls
something
of
your
charming
english
life
we
are
all
so
interested
miss
carlisle
voice
came
in
a
sweet
treble
like
a
canary
the
princess
of
wales
keeps
her
beauty
does
she
not
the
study
hall
was
a
long
red
room
well
enough
lighted
with
a
dais
holding
desk
and
chairs
roger
michael
seated
in
one
of
these
watched
while
her
hostess
made
a
little
speech
of
introduction
the
bright
parterre
of
young
faces
sitting
so
she
excercised
a
discrimination
that
had
not
been
possible
in
the
of
the
faces
before
her
each
was
different
after
all
from
the
other
there
were
keen
faces
as
well
as
languorous
ones
brows
that
promised
as
well
as
those
that
did
not
behind
the
prevailing
sweet
expression
something
sometimes
that
showed
as
by
heat
lightning
something
that
had
depth
here
as
elsewhere
thought
roger
michael
the
same
life
legrand
was
closing
was
turning
toward
her
she
rose
bowed
toward
the
mistress
of
eglantine
then
standing
square
with
her
good
english
figure
and
her
sensibly
shod
english
feet
she
began
to
talk
to
these
girls
she
did
not
however
speak
to
them
as
even
after
she
rose
she
meant
to
speak
she
did
not
talk
letters
in
england
nor
english
landscape
she
spoke
quite
differently
she
spoke
of
industrial
and
social
unrest
of
conditions
among
the
toilers
of
the
world
i
am
what
is
called
a
fabian
she
said
and
went
on
as
though
that
explained
she
spoke
of
certain
movements
in
thought
of
toward
larger
horizons
she
spoke
of
various
heresies
political
social
and
other
of
course
i
do
call
them
heresies
i
call
them
enlarging
vision
she
gave
instances
incidents
she
spoke
of
the
dawn
coming
over
the
mountains
and
of
the
trumpet
call
of
the
coming
time
she
said
that
the
dying
nineteenth
century
heard
the
stronger
voice
of
the
twentieth
century
and
that
it
was
a
voice
with
a
great
promise
she
spoke
of
women
of
the
rapidly
changing
status
of
women
of
what
machinery
had
done
for
women
of
what
education
had
done
she
spoke
of
the
great
needs
of
women
of
their
learning
to
organize
of
the
need
for
unity
among
women
she
used
the
words
false
position
thrice
woman
immemorially
false
position
society
has
so
falsely
placed
her
until
what
is
false
is
done
away
with
she
said
that
women
were
beginning
to
see
she
said
that
the
next
would
witness
a
revolution
you
young
people
before
me
will
see
it
some
of
you
will
take
part
in
it
i
congratulate
you
on
living
when
you
will
live
she
talked
for
nearly
an
hour
and
just
as
she
was
closing
it
came
to
her
with
a
certain
effect
of
startling
that
much
of
the
time
she
had
been
speaking
to
just
one
countenance
there
she
was
speaking
directly
to
the
girl
called
hagar
ashendyne
sitting
halfway
down
the
hall
when
she
took
her
seat
there
followed
a
deep
little
moment
of
silence
broken
at
last
by
applause
roger
michael
marked
the
girl
in
green
she
did
applaud
she
sat
looking
very
far
away
legrand
was
saying
something
smoothly
perfunctory
beflowered
with
personal
compliments
the
girls
all
stood
the
eglantine
hostess
and
guest
with
the
teachers
who
had
been
at
table
passed
from
the
platform
and
turned
after
a
space
of
hallway
into
the
big
parlour
miss
carlisle
and
miss
bedford
brought
up
the
rear
did
you
think
murmured
the
latter
that
that
was
a
very
curious
speech
now
and
then
i
felt
so
it
was
as
though
in
a
moment
she
was
going
to
say
something
indelicate
dear
legrand
ought
to
have
told
her
how
careful
we
are
with
our
girls
the
wind
rose
that
night
and
swept
around
the
tower
room
and
then
between
eleven
and
twelve
died
away
and
left
a
calm
that
by
contrast
was
achingly
still
hagar
was
not
yet
asleep
she
lay
straight
and
still
in
the
narrow
bed
her
arms
behind
her
head
she
was
rarely
in
a
hurry
to
go
to
sleep
this
hour
and
a
half
was
her
time
her
time
for
romance
building
her
time
for
floating
here
and
there
as
in
a
witch
of
atlas
boat
in
her
own
land
she
had
in
the
stalls
of
her
mind
half
a
dozen
vague
and
floating
romances
silver
and
tenuous
as
mist
one
night
she
drove
one
afield
another
night
another
all
took
place
in
a
kind
of
other
space
in
countries
that
were
not
on
any
map
she
brought
imagined
physical
features
into
a
strange
juxtaposition
when
the
himalayas
haunted
her
she
ranged
them
by
a
west
indian
sea
√¶tna
and
chimborazo
rose
over
against
each
other
and
a
favourite
haunt
was
a
lawn
reached
only
through
crashing
leagues
of
icebergs
she
took
over
localities
that
other
minds
had
made
when
she
wished
to
she
pushed
aside
a
curtain
of
vine
and
entered
the
forest
of
arden
she
knew
how
the
moonlight
fell
in
the
wood
outside
athens
she
entered
the
pilotless
boat
and
drove
toward
the
sunset
gate
of
the
domain
of
arnheim
usually
speaking
people
out
of
books
made
the
population
of
these
places
and
here
too
there
were
strange
juxtapositions
she
looped
and
folded
time
like
a
ribbon
mark
antony
and
robin
hood
were
contemporaries
pericles
and
philip
sidney
ruth
and
naomi
came
up
abreast
with
joan
of
arc
and
all
three
with
grace
darling
the
round
table
and
the
girondins
were
acquainted
all
manner
of
historic
and
fictive
folk
wandered
in
the
glades
of
her
imagination
any
kind
of
rendezvous
was
possible
much
went
on
in
that
inner
world
doubts
and
dreams
and
dim
hypotheses
romance
run
wild

passion

with
this

now
with
that

dream

dream

religions
world
cataclysms
passionings
over
a
colour
a
tone
a
line
of
verse
much
utter
spring
and
burgeoning
eighteen
years
a
fluid
unimprisoned
mind
and
no
confidante
but
herself
of
how
recapitulatory
were
these
hours
of
how
youth
of
all
the
ages
surged
pulsed
vibrated
through
her
slender
frame
she
had
of
course
no
adequate
notion
she
would
simply
have
said
that
she
could
sleep
and
that
she
liked
to
tell
herself
stories
as
she
lay
here
now
she
was
not
thinking
of
roger
michael
talk
though
she
had
thought
of
it
for
the
first
twenty
minutes
after
she
had
put
out
the
lamp
it
had
been
very
interesting
and
it
had
stirred
her
while
it
was
in
the
saying
but
the
grappling
hook
had
not
finally
held
she
was
not
ready
for
it
she
had
let
it
slip
from
her
mind
in
favour
of
the
rose
and
purple
and
deep
violin
humming
of
one
of
her
romances
she
had
lain
for
an
hour
in
a
great
wood
like
a
wood
in
xanadu
beneath
trees
that
touched
the
sky
and
like
an
elfin
stream
had
gone
by
knights
and
ladies
the
great
clock
down
in
the
hall
struck
twelve
she
turned
her
slender
body
and
the
bed
being
pushed
against
the
window
laid
her
outstretched
hands
upon
the
and
looked
up
between
the
spectral
sycamore
boughs
to
where
sirius
blazed
dream
wood
and
dream
shapes
took
flight
she
lay
with
parted
lips
her
mind
quiet
her
soul
awake
minutes
passed
a
cloud
drove
behind
the
sycamore
branches
and
hid
the
star
first
blankness
came
and
then
again
unrest
she
sat
up
in
bed
pushing
her
two
heavy
braids
of
hair
back
over
her
shoulders
the
small
clock
upon
the
mantel
ticked
and
ticked
the
little
room
looked
cold
in
the
watery
moonlight
hagar
was
not
dreaming
or
imagining
now
she
was
thinking
back
she
sat
very
still
for
five
minutes
tears
slowly
gathering
in
her
eyes
at
last
she
turned
and
lay
face
down
upon
the

her
outstretched
hands
against
the
wooden
frame
her
tears

the

of
her

vii
laydon
the
winter
was
so
open
so
mild
and
warm
that
a
few
pale
roses
clung
to
their
stems
through
half
of
december
christmas
proved
a
green
christmas
neither
snow
nor
ice
but
soft
indian
summer
weather
eglantine
always
gave
two
weeks
holiday
at
christmas
it
was
a
great
place
for
holidays
right
and
left
went
the
girls
those
whose
own
homes
were
too
far
away
went
with
roommates
or
bosom
friends
to
theirs
hardly
a
pupil
was
left
to
mope
in
the
rooms
that
grew
so
still
most
of
the
teachers
went
away
the
scattering
was
general
but
hagar
remained
at
eglantine
gilead
balm
was
a
good
long
way
off
she
had
gone
home
last
christmas
and
the
christmas
before
but
this
year
she
hardly
knew
how
she
had
missed
it
in
the
most
recently
received
of
his
rare
letters
her
grandfather
had
explicitly
stated
that
though
he
was
prepared
to
pay
for
her
schooling
and
to
support
her
until
she
married
she
must
on
her
side
get
along
with
as
little
money
as
possible
it
was
criminal
that
he
had
so
little
nowadays
but
such
was
the
melancholy
fact
the
whole
world
was
going
to
the
dogs
he
sometimes
felt
a
cold
doubt
as
to
whether
he
could
hold
gilead
balm
he
wished
to
die
there
at
any
rate
hagar
had
been
very
unhappy
over
that
letter
and
it
set
her
to
wondering
more
strongly
than
ever
about
money
and
to
longing
to
make
it
in
her
return
letters
he
suggested
that
she
stay
at
eglantine
this
christmas
and
so
save
travelling
expenses
and
in
order
that
gilead
balm
might
not
feel
that
she
would
be
too
dreadfully
disappointed
she
said
that
it
was
very
pleasant
at
eglantine
and
that
several
of
the
girls
were
going
to
stay
and
that
she
would
be
quite
happy
and
would
mind
it
much
though
of
course
she
wanted
to
see
them
all
at
gilead
balm
the
plan
was
of
her
suggesting
but
she
had
not
realized
that
they
might
fall
in
with
it
when
her
grandmother
answered
at
length
explaining
losses
that
the
colonel
had
sustained
and
agreeing
that
this
year
it
might
be
best
for
her
to
stay
at
eglantine
she
tried
not
to
feel
desperately
hurt
and
despondent
she
loved
gilead
balm
loved
it
as
much
as
her
mother
had
hated
it
old
miss
letter
had
shown
her
own
disappointment
but
you
are
getting
to
be
a
woman
and
must
consider
the
family
ashendyne
and
coltsworth
women
i
am
glad
to
say
have
always
known
their
duty
to
the
family
and
have
lived
up
to
it
the
last
half
of
the
letter
had
a
good
deal
to
say
of
ralph
coltsworth
who
was
at
the
university
hagar
was
here
at
eglantine
and
it
was
two
days
before
christmas
and
most
of
the
girls
were
gone
sylvie
was
gone
the
teacher
whom
she
liked
best
miss
gage
was
gone
legrand
who
liked
holidays
too
was
going
lane
and
miss
bedford
and
the
housekeeper
were
not
going
and
they
and
the
servants
would
look
after
eglantine
besides
these
there
would
be
left
the
books
in
the
and
hagar
would
have
leave
to
be
out
of
doors
in
the
winding
walks
and
beneath
the
trees
alone
and
whenever
she
pleased
the
weather
was
dreamy
still
everywhere
a
warm
amethyst
haze
this
morning
had
come
a
box
from
gilead
balm
her
grandmother
had
filled
it
with
good
things
to
eat
and
the
colonel
sent
his
love
and
a
small
there
was
a
pretty
belt
from
captain
bob
and
a
plate
and
a
soft
pink
wool
crocheted
fascinator
from
miss
serena
green
sent
a
hemstitched
handkerchief
and
the
servants
sent
a
christmas
card
through
the
box
were
scattered
little
sprays
from
the
gilead
balm
cedars
and
there
was
a
bunch
of
white
and
red
and
button
chrysanthemums
hagar
sitting
on
the
unpacked
everything
then
went
off
into
a
brown
study
the
chrysanthemums
in
her
lap
later
in
the
morning
she
arranged
upon
the
plate
some
pieces
of
candy
several
slices
of
fruitcake
three
or
four
lady
apples
and
a
number
of
old
miss
exquisitely
thin
and
crisp
wafers
and
with
it
in
her
hand
went
downstairs
to
legrand
room
knocked
at
the
door
and
was
bidden
to
enter
legrand
herself
from
a
flowery
couch
near
the
fire
put
the
novel
that
she
was
reading
behind
her
pillow
and
stretched
out
her
hand
ah
hagar
goodies
from
gilead
balm
how
nice
thank
you
my
dear
she
took
a
piece
of
cocoanut
candy
then
waved
the
plate
to
the
round
table
put
it
there
dear
child
now
sit
down
for
a
minute
and
keep
me
company
hagar
took
the
straight
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
the
bright
leaping
flame
was
between
the
two
it
made
a
kind
of
softer
daylight
and
full
in
the
heart
of
it
showed
legrand
handsome
not
yet
elderly
countenance
the
ripe
fullness
of
her
bust
covered
by
a
figured
silk
and
her
smooth
carefully
tended
hands
hagar
conceived
that
it
was
her
duty
to
think
well
and
highly
of
legrand
who
was
such
an
old
friend
of
the
family
and
who
she
knew
out
of
these
same
friendly
considerations
was
keeping
her
at
eglantine
on
the
easiest
of
terms
yes
it
was
certainly
her
duty
to
love
and
admire
legrand
that
she
did
not
do
so
caused
her
qualms
of
conscience
many
of
the
girls
raved
about
legrand
and
so
did
miss
carlisle
and
miss
bedford
hagar
supposed
with
a
sigh
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
her
own
heart
as
she
sat
in
the
straight
chair
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
she
experienced
a
resurgence
of
an
old
childhood
dislike
she
saw
again
the
gilead
balm
library
and
the
pool
of
sunlight
on
the
floor
and
the
descent
of
man
and
heard
again
legrand
telling
the
bishop
that
she
hagar
was
reading
an
improper
book
time
between
then
and
now
simply
took
itself
away
like
a
painted
six
years
rolled
themselves
up
as
with
a
spring
and
that
hour
seamlessly
adjoined
this
hour
i
afraid
said
legrand
that
you
be
a
little
lonely
dear
child
but
it
wo
be
for
long
time
flies
so
i
do
exactly
get
lonely
said
hagar
gravely
you
are
going
down
the
river
are
you
yes
for
ten
days
my
dear
friends
at
idlewood
wo
hear
of
my
not
coming
they
were
my
dear
husband
dearest
cousins
lane
and
miss
bedford
together
with
brown
will
take
i
am
sure
the
best
of
care
of
things
here
yes
of
course
we
get
on
beautifully
said
hagar
laydon
is
not
going
away
either
his
mother
is
ill
and
he
will
not
leave
her
he
says
that
if
we
like
to
listen
he
will
come
over
in
the
evenings
and
read
aloud
to
us
laydon
was
teacher
of
at
eglantine
a
young
gentleman
with
a
good
voice
and
apparently
a
sincere
devotion
to
the
best
literature
eglantine
and
laydon
alike
believed
in
the
future
of
laydon
it
was
understood
that
his
acceptance
of
a
position
here
was
of
the
nature
of
a
makeshift
a
mere
on
his
road
to
high
places
he
and
his
mother
were
domiciled
with
a
cousin
from
whose
doorstep
you
might
toss
a
pebble
into
the
eglantine
grounds
in
the
past
few
years
the
neighbouring
town
had
begun
to
grow
it
had
thrown
out
a
street
which
all
but
touched
the
hedge
legrand
made
a
slight
motion
with
her
hand
on
which
was
her
with
an
old
pearl
ring
for
guard
i
shall
tell
lane
not
to
let
him
do
that
too
often
i
have
a
great
esteem
for
laydon
but
eglantine
can
not
be
too
careful
no
one
with
girls
in
their
charge
can
be
too
careful
what
is
the
gilead
balm
news
the
letter
was
from
grandmother
she
is
well
and
so
is
grandfather
they
have
had
a
great
deal
of
company
uncle
bob
has
had
rheumatism
but
he
goes
hunting
just
the
same
the
hawk
nest
coltsworths
are
coming
for
christmas
all
except
ralph
he
is
going
home
with
a
classmate
grandmother
says
he
is
the
handsomest
man
at
the
university
and
that
if
i
hear
tales
of
his
wildness
i
am
not
to
believe
them
she
says
all
men
are
a
little
wild
at
first
aunt
serena
is
learning
how
to
illuminate
texts
green
has
gone
to
see
her
daughter
who
has
something
the
matter
with
her
spine
thomasine
uncle
in
new
york
is
going
to
have
her
visit
him
and
grandmother
thinks
he
means
to
get
thomasine
a
place
in
a
store
grandmother
says
no
girl
ought
to
work
in
a
store
but
thomasine
people
are
very
poor
and
i
do
see
what
she
can
do
she
got
to
live
corker
has
a
place
but
he
is
doing
very
well
and
isham
have
put
a
porch
to
their
cabin
and
mary
magazine
has
gotten
religion
girls
of
thomasine
station
said
legrand
are
beginning
more
and
more
i
sorry
to
see
to
leave
home
to
work
for
pay
spreading
too
it
not
confined
to
girls
of
her
class
only
yesterday
i
heard
that
a
bright
pretty
girl
that
i
used
to
know
at
the
white
had
gone
to
philadelphia
to
study
to
be
a
nurse
and
there
nellie
wynne
trying
to
be
a
journalist
a
journalist
there
is
the
least
excuse
for
either
of
those
cases
one
of
those
girls
has
a
brother
and
the
other
a
father
quite
able
to
support
them
but
if
there
really
is
any
one
said
hagar
wistfully
and
if
you
feel
that
you
are
costing
a
lot
her
dreams
at
night
were
beginning
to
be
shot
with
a
vague
but
insistent
if
i
could
write
if
i
could
paint
or
teach
if
i
could
earn
money
there
is
almost
always
some
one
answered
legrand
and
if
a
girl
knows
how
to
make
the
best
of
herself
there
inevitably
arrives
her
own
establishment
and
the
right
man
to
take
care
of
her
if
she
shrugged
if
she
does
know
how
to
make
the
best
of
herself
she
might
as
well
go
work
in
a
store
no
one
would
especially
object
that
is
they
would
not
object
except
that
when
that
kind
of
thing
creeps
up
higher
in
the
scale
of
society
and
girls
who
can
perfectly
well
be
supported
at
home
go
out
and
work
for
pay
it
makes
an
unfortunate
kind
of
precedent
and
reacts
and
reflects
upon
those
who
do
know
how
to
make
the
best
of
themselves
hagar
spoke
diffidently
but
a
lot
of
women
had
to
work
after
the
war
lane
and
general
daughters
and
you
yourself
that
is
quite
different
said
legrand
gentlewomen
in
reduced
circumstances
may
have
to
battle
alone
with
the
world
but
they
do
not
like
it
and
it
is
only
hard
fate
that
has
put
them
in
that
position
it
an
unnatural
one
and
they
feel
it
as
such
what
i
am
talking
of
is
that
nowadays
you
see
women
young
women
actually
choosing
to
stand
alone
actually
declining
support
and
er
refusing
generally
to
make
the
best
of
themselves
it
part
of
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
that
you
begin
to
see
women
women
of
breeding
in
all
kinds
of
public
places
working
for
their
living
it
positively
shocking
it
opens
the
gate
to
all
kinds
of
things
wrong
things
ideas
notions
roger
michael
ideas
for
instance
which
i
must
say
are
extremely
i
regretted
that
i
had
asked
her
here
she
was
hardly
feminine
legrand
stretched
herself
rubbed
her
plump
firm
arms
from
which
the
figured
silk
had
fallen
back
and
rose
from
the
couch
i
hope
that
eglantine
girls
will
always
think
of
these
things
as
ladies
should
and
now
my
dear
will
you
tell
lane
that
i
want
to
see
her
legrand
went
away
from
eglantine
for
ten
days
of
the
women
teachers
living
in
the
house
all
went
but
lane
and
miss
bedford
all
the
girls
went
but
three
and
they
were
first
hagar
ashendyne
second
a
pale
thin
girl
from
the
far
south
a
martyr
to
sick
headaches
and
third
francie
smythe
a
girl
apparently
without
many
home
people
francie
was
sweetly
dull
with
small
eyes
and
a
perpetual
smile
how
quiet
seemed
the
great
house
with
its
many
rooms
they
closed
the
large
and
used
the
small
room
where
roger
michael
had
supped
they
shut
the
classrooms
and
the
and
the
and
sat
in
the
evenings
in
the
bowery
flowery
parlour
here
the
very
first
evening
and
the
second
came
laydon
with
browning
in
one
pocket
and
tennyson
in
the
other
lane
was
knitting
an
afghan
of
a
complicated
pattern
her
lips
moved
softly
continuously
counting
laydon
making
an
eloquent
pause
midway
of
tithonous
caught
this
two
three
and
had
a
fleeting
expression
of
pain
lane
saw
the
depth
to
which
she
had
sunk
in
his
esteem
and
flushed
over
her
delicate
pensive
face
for
the
remainder
of
the
hour
she
sat
with
her
knitting
in
her
lap
but
really
the
afghan
must
be
finished
and
so
the
second
evening
she
placed
her
chair
so
as
to
face
not
the
reader
but
a
shadowy
corner
and
so
knit
and
counted
in
peace
miss
bedford
neither
knit
nor
counted
she
said
that
she
adored
poetry
and
sighed
rapturously
where
something
seemed
to
be
indicated
she
also
adored
conversation
and
argumentation
as
to
this
or
that
nice
point
what
did
laydon
think
browning
really
meant
in
childe
roland
and
was
porphyria
lover
really
mad
was
amy
really
to
blame
in
locksley
hall
miss
bedford
made
play
with
her
rather
fine
eyes
and
teased
the
fringe
of
the
the
pale
girl
from
the
far
south
lily
was
her
name
sat
by
the
fire
and
now
rubbed
her
forehead
with
a
menthol
pencil
and
now
stroked
tipsy
parson
legrand
big
black
cat
francie
smythe
had
a
muslin
apron
full
of
coloured
silks
and
was
embroidering
a
yellow
roses
with
leaves
and
thorns
francie
was
a
great
embroiderer
hagar
sat
upon
a
low
stool
by
the
hearth
over
against
lily
close
to
the
slowly
burning
logs
she
was
a
the
flames
were
better
to
her
than
jewels
and
the
glowing
alleys
and
caverns
below
were
treasure
caves
and
temples
she
sat
listening
in
the
rosy
light
her
chin
in
her
hands
she
thought
that
laydon
read
very
well
very
well
indeed
the
end
of
evening
smiles
miles
and
miles
on
the
solitary
pastures
midway
of
the
poem
she
turned
a
little
so
that
she
could
see
the
reader
he
sat
in
the
circle
of
lamplight
a
presentable
man
and
enthusiastic
fairly
presentable
within
too
very
fairly
clean
a
good
son
filled
with
not
unhonourable
ambitions
good
average
human
stuff
with
an
individual
touch
of
impressionability
and
a
strong
desire
to
be
liked
as
he
expressed
it
for
himself
young
still
with
the
momentum
and
emanation
of
youth
the
lamp
had
a
rose
and
amber
shade
it
threw
a
softened
coloured
dreamy
light
everything
within
its
range
was
subtly
altered
and
enriched
i
knew
while
thus
the
eve
smiles
to
leave
to
their
folding
all
our
many
tinkling
fleece
in
such
peace
and
the
slopes
and
rills
in
undistinguished
grey
melt
away
hagar
sat
in
her
corner
upon
the
low
stool
in
the
firelight
as
motionless
as
though
she
were
in
a
trance
her
eyes
large
of
a
marvellous
hazel
beneath
straight
brows
of
deepest
brown
were
fixed
steadily
upon
the
man
reading
slowly
tentatively
something
rich
and
delicate
seemed
to
rise
within
her
something
that
clung
to
soul
and
body
something
strange
sweet
and
painful
something
that
spreading
and
deepening
with
great
swiftness
suffused
her
being
and
made
her
heart
at
once
ecstatic
and
sorrowful
she
blushed
deeply
felt
the
crimsoning
and
wished
to
drop
her
head
upon
her
arms
and
be
alone
in
a
balmy
darkness
it
was
as
though
she
were
in
a
strange
dream
or
in
one
of
her
long
romances
come
real
one
year
they
sent
a
million
fighters
forth
south
and
north
and
they
built
their
gods
a
brazen
pillar
high
as
the
sky
love
is
best
laydon
put
the
book
down
upon
the
table
while
he
read
one
of
the
maids
zinia
had
brought
a
note
to
miss
bedford
and
that
lady
had
gone
away
to
answer
it
lane
knitted
on
her
lips
moving
her
back
to
the
table
and
the
hearth
francie
smythe
was
sorting
silks
that
was
a
lovely
piece
she
said
unemotionally
and
went
on
dividing
orange
from
lemon
the
girl
with
the
menthol
pencil
was
more
appreciative
once
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
went
with
my
father
and
mother
to
rome
we
went
out
on
the
campagna
i
remember
now
how
it
was
all
green
and
flat
and
wide
as
the
sea
and
still
and
there
were
great
arches
running
away
away
and
a
mist
that
they
said
was
fever
her
voice
sank
she
sighed
and
rubbed
her
forehead
with
the
menthol
her
eyes
closed
edgar
laydon
rose
and
came
into
the
circle
of
firelight
he
was
moved
by
his
own
reading
shaken
with
the
impulse
and
rhythm
of
the
poem
he
stood
by
the
mantel
and
faced
hagar
she
was
one
of
his
pupils
she
recited
well
of
the
essays
the
compositions
which
were
produced
under
his
direction
hers
were
the
best
he
had
told
her
more
than
once
that
her
work
was
good
in
short
he
was
kindly
disposed
toward
her
to
this
instant
that
was
all
he
was
scrupulously
correct
in
his
attitude
toward
the
young
ladies
whom
he
taught
he
had
for
his
work
a
kind
of
unnecessary
scorn
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
teaching
men
or
at
the
very
least
should
hold
a
chair
in
some
actual
college
for
women
eglantine
was
nothing
but
a
young
ladies
seminary
he
felt
quite
an
enormous
gulf
between
himself
and
those
around
him
and
as
a
weakness
will
sometimes
quaintly
do
this
feeling
kept
him
steady
until
this
moment
he
was
as
indifferent
to
hagar
ashendyne
as
to
any
one
of
the
fifty
whom
he
taught
and
he
was
indifferent
to
them
all
he
had
a
picture
in
his
mind
of
the
woman
whom
some
day
he
meant
to
find
and
woo
but
she
was
in
the
least
like
any
one
at
eglantine
now
in
an
instant
came
a
change
hagar
eyes
very
quiet
and
limpid
were
upon
him
perhaps
deep
down
far
distant
from
her
conscious
self
she
willed
and
exercised
an
ancient
power
of
her
sex
and
charmed
him
to
her
perhaps
in
his
lifted
mood
the
great
sensuous
swing
of
the
verse
still
with
him
the
written
cry
of
passion
faintly
drumming
within
his
veins
he
would
have
suddenly
linked
that
diffused
emotion
to
whatever
presence
young
and
far
from
unpleasing
might
have
risen
at
this
moment
to
confront
him
however
that
may
be
laydon
eyes
and
those
of
hagar
met
each
gaze
held
the
other
for
a
breathless
moment
then
the
lids
fell
the
heart
beat
violently
a
colour
surged
over
the
face
and
receded
leaving
each
face
pale
a
log
burned
through
parted
striking
the
hearth
with
a
sound
like
the
click
of
a
closing
trap
lane
having
come
to
an
easy
part
in
the
pattern
turned
her
face
to
the
rest
of
the
room
are
we
going
to
have
some
more
poetry
read
us
some
more
mr
laydon
the
girl
with
the
menthol
pencil
spoke
dreamily
is
there
another
piece
about
the
campagna
i
can
see
it
plain
green
like
the
sea
and
arches
and
tombs
and
a
mist
hanging
over
it
and
a
road
going
on
a
road
going
on
a
road
going
on
chapter
viii
hagar
and
laydon
this
is
what
they
did
the
next
day
was
soft
as
balm
to
hagar
sitting
in
the
sun
on
the
step
of
the
west
porch
came
the
sound
of
steps
over
the
fallen
leaves
of
what
was
called
at
eglantine
the
syringa
alley
sycamore
boughs
above
and
syringa
bushes
thickly
planted
and
grown
tall
making
winding
walls
for
a
winding
path
the
red
surged
over
hagar
her
eyes
laydon
emerging
from
the
alley
came
straight
toward
her
over
a
space
of
gravel
and
leaves
it
was
the
place
open
and
sunny
to
be
viewed
from
more
windows
than
one
with
the
servants
moreover
going
to
and
fro
on
their
morning
business
apt
to
pass
this
gable
end
aunt
dorinda
for
instance
the
old
turbaned
cook
passed
but
she
saw
nothing
but
one
of
the
teachers
stopping
to
say
merry
christmas
to
miss
hagar
all
the
servants
liked
miss
hagar
what
laydon
said
was
not
merry
christmas
but
hagar
hagar
that
was
love
came
to
us
last
night
i
have
not
slept
i
have
been
like
a
madman
all
night
i
did
not
know
there
was
such
a
force
in
the
world
i
did
not
sleep
either
answered
hagar
i
did
not
sleep
at
all
every
one
can
see
us
here
let
us
walk
toward
the
gate
through
the
alley
she
rose
from
the
step
and
went
with
him
well
in
the
shelter
of
the
syringa
hidden
from
the
house
he
stopped
and
laid
his
hands
lightly
upon
her
shoulders
then
as
she
did
not
resist
drew
her
to
him
they
kissed
they
clung
together
in
a
long
embrace
they
uttered
immemorial
words
smothering
each
with
each
then
they
fell
apart
and
hagar
first
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
then
uncovering
it
broke
into
tremulous
laughter
laughter
that
had
a
sobbing
note
what
will
they
say
at
gilead
balm
oh
what
will
they
say
at
gilead
balm
say
answered
laydon
they
say
that
they
wish
your
happiness
hagar
how
old
are
you
i
nearly
eighteen
and
old
for
your
years
and
i
i
am
and
young
for
my
years
laydon
laughed
too
he
was
giddy
with
happiness
gilead
balm
what
a
strange
name
for
a
place
and
you
lived
there
always
always
they
were
moving
now
down
the
alley
toward
a
gate
that
gave
upon
the
highroad
near
by
lay
an
open
field
seized
upon
at
christmas
by
a
mob
of
small
boys
with
squibs
and
torpedoes
and
cannon
crackers
they
had
a
bonfire
and
the
wood
smoke
drifted
across
together
with
the
odour
of
burning
powder
the
boys
were
shouting
like
liliputian
soldiery
and
the
squibs
and
giant
crackers
shook
the
air
as
with
a
continuous
elfin
bombardment
the
nearest
church
was
ringing
its
bells
laydon
and
hagar
came
to
the
gate
not
the
main
but
a
lesser
entrance
to
eglantine
no
one
was
in
view
hand
in
hand
they
leaned
against
the
wooden
palings
before
them
stretched
the
road
an
old
country
pike
going
on
and
on
between
cedar
and
locust
and
thorn
until
it
dropped
into
the
violet
distance
i
wish
we
were
out
upon
it
said
hagar
i
wish
we
were
out
upon
it
going
on
and
on
through
the
world
travelling
like
gipsies
you
look
like
a
gipsy
he
said
have
you
got
gipsy
blood
in
you
no
yes
just
to
go
on
and
on
the
open
road
and
a
clear
fire
at
night
and
to
see
all
things
hagar
why
did
they
call
you
hagar
i
do
know
my
mother
named
me
hagar
we
got
to
think
a
little
it
took
us
so
by
surprise
we
had
best
i
think
just
quietly
say
nothing
to
anybody
for
a
while
do
you
think
so
i
had
not
thought
about
it
but
i
will
said
hagar
she
gazed
down
the
road
her
brows
knit
the
christmas
cannonading
went
on
a
continuous
miniature
tearing
and
shaking
of
the
air
with
a
dwarf
shouting
and
laughing
and
small
coalescing
clouds
of
powder
smoke
the
road
ran
a
quiet
sunny
streak
past
this
small
bedlam
into
the
still
distance
i
wo
tell
any
one
at
eglantine
she
said
at
last
until
legrand
comes
back
she
will
be
back
in
a
week
but
i
write
to
grandmother
laydon
measured
the
gate
with
his
hand
i
had
rather
not
tell
my
mother
at
once
she
is
very
delicate
and
nervous
and
perhaps
she
has
grown
a
little
selfish
in
her
love
for
me
besides
she
had
set
her
heart
on
he
threw
that
matter
aside
it
being
a
young
and
attractive
kinswoman
with
money
i
had
rather
not
tell
her
just
now
then
as
to
legrand
of
course
i
suppose
as
i
am
a
teacher
here
and
you
are
a
pupil
but
there
too
had
we
not
best
delay
a
little
it
will
make
a
confusion
things
will
be
said
my
position
will
become
an
embarrassing
one
and
you
too
hagar
it
wo
be
pleasant
for
you
either
is
it
better
just
to
keep
our
own
concerns
to
ourselves
for
a
while
and
your
people
up
the
river
why
not
tell
them
until
then
when
you
go
home
and
when
i
have
finished
my
engagement
here
for
i
do
propose
to
come
back
to
eglantine
next
year
then
you
can
tell
them
and
so
much
better
than
you
could
write
it
i
could
follow
you
to
gilead
balm
we
could
tell
them
together
then
we
could
discuss
matters
and
our
future
intelligently
and
that
is
impossible
at
the
moment
let
us
just
quietly
keep
our
happiness
to
ourselves
for
a
while
why
should
the
world
pry
into
it
he
seized
her
hands
and
pressed
his
face
against
them
let
us
be
happy
and
silent
she
looked
at
him
with
her
candid
eyes
no
we
should
be
happy
that
way
i
write
to
grandmother
they
gazed
at
each
other
the
gate
between
them
the
strong
enchantment
held
but
a
momentary
perplexity
crossed
it
and
the
never
dust
of
pain
was
stirred
i
am
not
asking
anything
wrong
said
laydon
a
hurt
note
in
his
voice
i
only
see
certain
embarrassments
difficulties
that
may
arise
but
darling
darling
it
shall
be
just
as
you
please
crowns
resign
to
call
you
mine
and
so
i
reckon
i
can
face
mother
and
legrand
and
colonel
ashendyne
a
flush
came
into
his
cheek
i
been
so
foolish
too
as
to
as
to
pay
a
little
attention
to
miss
bedford
but
she
is
too
sensible
a
woman
to
think
that
i
meant
anything
seriously
did
you
not
in
the
least
said
laydon
truthfully
a
man
gets
lonely
and
he
craves
affection
and
understanding
and
he
in
a
muddle
before
he
knows
it
there
is
anything
else
there
and
i
never
said
a
word
of
to
her
darling
darling
i
never
loved
any
one
until
last
night
by
the
fire
and
you
looked
up
at
me
with
those
wonderful
eyes
and
i
looked
down
and
our
eyes
met
and
held
and
it
was
like
a
fine
flame
all
over
and
now
i
yours
till
death
and
i
run
any
gauntlet
you
tell
me
to
run
if
you
write
to
your
people
so
will
write
to
colonel
ashendyne
they
left
the
gate
and
again
pursued
the
syringa
alley
the
sound
of
the
christmas
bombardment
drifted
away
when
they
reached
the
shadow
of
the
great
bushes
he
kissed
her
again
all
the
air
was
blue
and
hazy
and
the
church
bells
were
ringing
ringing
i
have
any
money
said
laydon
mother
has
a
very
little
but
i
never
been
able
somehow
to
lay
by
i
begin
now
though
and
then
as
i
told
you
i
expect
next
year
to
have
a
much
better
situation
at
thinks
he
may
get
me
in
there
it
would
be
delightful
a
real
field
at
last
the
best
of
surroundings
and
a
tolerable
salary
if
i
were
fortunate
there
we
could
marry
very
soon
darling
darling
but
as
it
is
it
is
wretched
that
eglantine
pays
so
little
and
that
there
is
so
little
recognition
here
of
ability
no
career
no
opportunity
but
just
you
wait
and
see
you
one
bright
spot
here
hagar
gazed
at
the
winding
path
strewn
with
bronze
leaves
and
at
the
syringa
bushes
later
to
be
laden
with
fragrant
bloom
and
at
the
great
white
sycamore
boughs
against
the
pallid
blue
and
at
the
roof
and
chimneys
of
eglantine
now
apparent
behind
the
fretwork
of
trees
the
inner
eye
saw
the
house
within
the
rooms
her
tower
room
and
all
the
human
life
the
girls
the
teachers
the
servants
bright
drops
came
to
her
eyes
i
been
unhappy
here
too
sometimes
but
i
could
stay
three
years
in
a
place
and
not
love
something
about
it
that
is
because
you
are
a
woman
said
the
lover
with
a
man
it
is
different
if
a
place
is
right
it
is
if
i
had
but
five
thousand
dollars
then
we
might
marry
in
a
month
time
as
it
is
we
have
to
wait
and
wait
and
wait
i
am
going
to
work
too
said
hagar
i
am
going
to
try
somehow
to
make
money
he
laughed
you
dear
gipsy
you
just
keep
your
beautiful
large
eyes
and
those
dusky
warm
waves
of
hair
and
your
long
slim
fingers
and
the
way
you
hold
yourself
and
let
to
earn
money
go
hang
my
part
too
many
women
are
trying
to
earn
money
anyhow
competing
with
you
got
just
to
be
your
beautiful
self
and
keep
on
loving
me
he
drew
a
long
breath
jove
i
can
see
you
now
in
a
parlour
that
our
own
at
receiving
guests
famous
guests
maybe
after
a
while
people
who
will
come
distances
to
see
me
for
i
do
mean
to
remain
unknown
i
know
i
got
ability
before
they
left
the
alley
they
settled
that
both
should
write
that
night
to
gilead
balm
laydon
found
the
idea
distasteful
enough
older
and
more
than
the
other
he
knew
that
there
would
probably
ensue
a
tempest
and
he
was
constitutionally
averse
to
tempests
he
was
well
enough
in
family
but
no
great
things
he
had
a
good
education
but
so
had
others
he
could
give
a
good
character
already
he
was
running
over
in
mind
a
list
of
clergymen
educators
prominent
citizens
and
confederate
veterans
to
whom
he
could
refer
colonel
ashendyne
he
had
some
doubt
however
as
to
whether
comparative
spotlessness
of
character
would
have
with
colonel
ashendyne
the
predominant
and
overweening
value
that
it
should
have
money
he
had
no
means
position
he
had
as
yet
an
uncertain
foothold
in
the
world
and
no
powerful
relatives
to
push
him
unbounded
confidence
he
had
in
himself
but
the
point
was
to
create
that
confidence
in
hagar
people
of
course
they
would
say
that
she
was
too
young
and
that
he
had
taken
advantage
his
skirts
were
clear
there
both
had
truthfully
been
taken
prisoners
fallen
into
an
ambuscade
of
ancient
instinct
there
had
been
the
slightest
premeditation
but
how
to
convey
that
fact
to
the
old
bourbon
up
the
river
laydon
had
once
been
introduced
to
colonel
ashendyne
upon
one
of
the
latter
rare
visits
to
the
neighbouring
city
and
to
eglantine
he
remembered
stingingly
the
colonel
calm
and
gentlemanly
willingness
immediately
to
forget
the
existence
of
a
teacher
of
in
a
young
ladies
school
the
letter
to
gilead
balm
he
did
want
to
write
it
but
he
was
going
to
oh
he
was
going
to
women
were
curiously
selfish
about
some
things
legrand
too
he
thought
that
he
would
write
about
it
to
legrand
he
could
imagine
what
she
would
say
and
he
did
want
to
hear
it
he
was
in
love
and
he
was
going
to
do
the
honourable
thing
of
course
he
had
no
idea
otherwise
but
he
certainly
entertained
the
wish
that
hagar
could
see
how
entirely
honourable
as
well
as
discreet
would
be
silence
for
a
while
hagar
never
thought
of
it
in
terms
of
honour
she
had
no
adequate
idea
of
his
reluctance
it
might
be
said
that
she
knew
already
the
arching
of
legrand
brows
and
the
lightning
and
thunder
that
might
issue
from
gilead
balm
grandfather
and
grandmother
aunt
serena
and
uncle
bob
looked
upon
her
as
nothing
but
a
child
she
was
a
child
she
was
eighteen
she
felt
no
need
to
vindicate
herself
nor
to
apologize
she
was
moving
through
what
was
still
almost
pure
bliss
moving
with
a
dreamlike
tolerance
of
difficulties
what
did
it
matter
all
those
things
they
were
so
little
the
air
was
wine
and
velvet
colours
were
at
once
soft
and
clear
sound
was
golden
in
the
general
transfiguration
the
man
by
her
side
appeared
much
like
a
demigod
her
wings
were
fairly
caught
and
held
by
the
honey
it
was
natural
for
her
to
act
straightforwardly
and
when
she
must
propose
that
she
act
so
still
it
was
simply
a
putting
forward
an
unveiling
of
the
mass
of
her
nature
she
showed
herself
thus
and
so
and
then
went
on
in
her
happy
dream
had
he
been
able
to
make
her
realize
his
great
magnanimity
in
giving
up
his
point
of
view
to
hers
perhaps
she
might
have
striven
for
magnanimity
too
and
acquiesced
in
a
temporary
secrecy
perhaps
not
on
the
whole
perhaps
not
had
she
deeply
felt
the
secrecy
to
be
necessary
had
they
paced
the
earth
in
another
time
and
amid
actual
dangers
wild
beasts
could
not
have
torn
from
her
a
relation
of
their
case
but
laydon
thought
that
she
was
thinking
in
terms
of
honour
pure
women
were
naturally
up
in
arms
at
the
suggestion
of
secrecy
their
delicate
minds
had
at
once
a
vision
of
deception
desertion
all
kinds
of
horrors
he
acknowledged
that
men
had
given
them
reason
for
the
vision
they
could
not
be
blamed
if
they
saw
it
even
when
an
entirely
honourable
and
devoted
man
was
at
their
feet
he
smiled
at
what
he
supposed
hagar
thought
his
warm
sense
of
natural
supremacy
became
rich
and
deep
he
felt
like
an
eastern
king
unfolding
a
generous
and
noble
nature
to
some
suppliant
who
had
reason
to
doubt
those
qualities
in
eastern
kings
at
large
he
experienced
a
sumptuous
oriental
feeling
poor
little
girl
if
she
had
any
absurd
fear
like
that
he
began
to
be
eager
to
get
to
the
letter
to
colonel
ashendyne
he
could
see
his
own
strong
black
handwriting
on
a
large
sheet
of
bond
paper
dear
colonel
ashendyne
you
will
doubtless
be
surprised
at
the
nature
and
contents
of
this
letter
but

the

and
the
west
wing
of
the
house
beyond
which
stretched
the

opened
upon

zinia
the
mulatto

and

the

in

miss

had
a

where

she
asked
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer

hagar

in
and
tied
up
parcels
in
coloured
tissue
paper
the
day
went
by
as
in
a
dream
there
was
a
christmas
dinner
with
holly
on
the
table
and
little
red
candles
and
in
the
afternoon
she
went
with
lane
to
a
christmas
tree
for
poor
children
in
the
room
of
a
neighbouring
church
the
tree
blazed
with
an
unearthly
splendour
the
star
in
the
top
seemed
effulgent
the
ohs
and
ahs
and
laughter
of
the
circling
children
fell
into
a
rhythm
like
sweet
low
distant
thunder
that
night
she
wrote
both
to
her
grandmother
and
her
grandfather
when
she
had
made
an
end
of
doing
so
she
kneeled
upon
the
braided
rug
before
the
fire
in
her
tower
room
loosed
her
dark
hair
shook
it
around
her
and
sat
as
in
a
tent
her
arms
clasping
her
knees
her
head
bowed
upon
them

ix
romeo

that
week
a
noted
actress
played
juliet
several
evenings
in
succession
at
the
theatre
in
the
neighbouring
town
the
ladies
left
adrift
at
eglantine
read
in
the
morning
paper
a
glowing
report
of
the
performance
miss
bedford
said
she
was
going
she
never
missed
an
opportunity
to
see
romeo
and
juliet
laydon
walking
in
at
that
moment
they
were
all
in
the
small
caught
the
statement
why
should
you
all
go
i
have
seen
her
play
it
once
but
i
like
to
see
it
again
he
laughed
i
feel
reckless
and
i
going
to
get
up
a
lane
wo
you
go
lane
shook
her
head
my
theatre
days
are
over
she
said
in
her
gentle
plaintive
voice
thank
you
just
the
same
laydon
but
the
others
might
like
to
go
miss
bedford
we
ought
said
miss
bedford
by
rights
to
have
lane
to
chaperon
us
but
it
christmas
is
it
and
everybody
a
little
mad
thank
you
mr
laydon
laydon
looked
at
francie
miss
smythe
wo
you
come
too
he
had
made
a
rapid
calculation
yes
it
would
cost
only
so
much
they
would
go
in
of
course
on
the
street
car
and
in
order
to
ask
one
he
would
have
to
ask
all
yes
francie
would
go
though
she
was
sorry
that
it
was
shakespeare
and
just
caught
herself
in
time
from
saying
so
it
will
be
lovely
she
said
instead
unemotionally
miss
bedford
supplied
the
lacking
enthusiasm
it
will
be
the
treat
of
the
winter
oh
the
balcony
scene
and
where
she
drinks
the
and
the
tomb
she
moved
nearer
laydon
as
she
spoke
and
managed
to
convey
to
him
you
must
be
extravagant
you
generous
man
do
think
that
you
have
to
ask
these
girls
just
because
they
are
in
the
room
but
she
was
too
late
laydon
was
already
asking
miss
goldwell
wo
you
come
too
to
see
and
juliet
if
she
did
have
a
headache
miss
goldwell
would
be
glad
to
thank
you
mr
laydon
miss
ashendyne
wo
you
yes
thank
you
i
will
go
at
once
said
laydon
and
get
the
tickets
in
the
end
lily
goldwell
went
and
francie
smythe
did
not
francie
developed
a
sore
throat
that
put
lane
in
terror
of
tonsillitis
nothing
must
go
wrong
nobody
must
get
ill
while
dear
legrand
was
away
it
would
be
madness
for
francie
to
go
out
where
what
legrand
might
think
came
into
it
lane
was
adamant
francie
sullenly
stayed
at
home
lily
for
a
marvel
did
have
a
headache
and
she
said
she
would
take
her
menthol
pencil
in
case
the
music
should
bring
on
one
the
four
walked
down
the
avenue
beneath
the
whispering
trees
there
was
no
moon
but
the
stars
shone
bright
and
it
was
not
cold
laydon
and
miss
bedford
went
a
little
in
front
and
lily
and
hagar
followed
they
passed
through
the
big
gate
and
walking
down
the
road
a
little
way
came
to
where
the
road
became
a
street
and
at
ten
minutes
interval
a
jingled
up
reversed
and
jingled
back
to
town
again
on
the
miss
bedford
and
laydon
were
again
together
and
lily
and
hagar
between
the
two
pairs
stretched
a
row
of
men
several
with
the
evening
newspaper
it
was
too
warm
in
the
car
and
lily
murmuring
something
took
out
her
menthol
pencil
hagar
studied
the
score
of
occupants
and
the
row
of
advertisements
and
the
dark
night
without
the
windows
the
man
next
her
had
a
newspaper
and
now
he
began
to
talk
to
an
older
man
beside
him
the
country
doing
pretty
well
seems
to
me
the
other
grunted
is
anything
doing
pretty
well
i
getting
to
be
a
populist
oh
go
away
are
you
going
to
the
world
fair
no
there
going
to
be
the
biggest
panic
yet
in
this
country
about
one
year
from
now
oh
cheer
up
you
been
living
on
homestead
if
i
have
it
poor
living
across
the
aisle
a
woman
was
talking
about
the
famine
in
russia
we
are
going
to
try
to
get
up
a
bazaar
and
make
a
little
money
to
send
to
get
food
with
tolstoy
the
jingled
jingled
through
the
night
all
the
windows
were
down
it
grew
hot
and
close
and
crowded
the
black
night
without
pressed
alongside
peered
through
the
clouded
glass
within
were
a
muddy
glare
and
swaying
and
the
mingled
breath
of
people
lily
sighed
do
you
ever
wish
for
just
a
clear
nothing
no
pain
no
feeling
no
people
no
light
no
sound
no
anything
the
turned
a
corner
and
swayed
and
jingled
into
a
lighted
business
street
where
were
christmas
windows
and
upon
the
pavement
a
christmas
throng
a
drug
store
a
wine
and
liquor
store
a
grocery
a
clothing
store
a
wine
and
liquor
store
a
drug
store
amber
and
crimson
green
and
blue
broken
and
restless
arrived
the
lights
through
the
filmy
glass
laughter
and
voices
of
the
crowd
came
with
a
distant
humming
through
which
clanged
the
bell
the
car
stopped
for
passengers
then
creaked
on
again
a
workman
entered
stood
for
a
couple
of
minutes
touching
hagar
skirt
then
a
man
opposite
rising
and
leaving
the
car
sank
into
the
vacant
place
hagar
eyes
swept
him
dreamily
then
she
knew
not
why
she
fell
to
observing
him
with
a
puzzled
stealthy
gaze
he
was
certainly
young
and
yet
he
did
not
look
so
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
covered
by
a
short
soft
dark
beard
he
had
a
battered
slouch
hat
pulled
down
low
the
eyes
beneath
were
sombre
and
the
face
lined
there
was
a
dinner
pail
at
his
feet
he
too
had
an
evening
paper
hagar
saw
the
headlines
of
the
piece
he
was
reading
homestead
and
underneath
strong
hand
of
the
law
outside
topaz
and
ruby
and
emerald
drifted
by
the
windows
of
a
wine
and
liquor
store
she
knit
her
brows
some
current
in
the
shoreless
sea
of
mind
had
been
started
but
she
could
not
trace
its
beginning
nor
where
it
led
another
minute
and
the
car
stopped
before
the
theatre
within
laydon
manoeuvred
and
the
end
was
that
if
he
had
miss
bedford
upon
his
right
yet
he
had
hagar
upon
his
left
the
orchestra
had
not
yet
begun
the
house
was
dim
people
entering
those
seated
having
to
stand
up
to
let
the
others
pass
once
when
this
happened
he
leaned
toward
her
until
their
shoulders
touched
until
his
breath
was
upon
her
cheek
he
dared
so
much
as
to
whisper
if
only
we
were
here
just
you
and
i
together
every
one
was
seated
now
and
she
looked
at
the
people
with
their
festal
christmas
air
there
was
a
girl
in
a
box
who
was
like
sylvie
and
nearer
yet
a
gentleman
with
a
certain
vague
resemblance
to
her
grandfather
her
thought
flashed
across
the
dark
country
up
the
winding
river
to
gilead
balm
they
would
have
had
her
letter
yesterday
the
shimmer
and
murmur
of
the
filled
theatre
were
all
about
her
but
so
was
gilead
balm
she
tried
to
hear
what
they
would
be
saying
there
the
music
began
and
in
a
moment
she
was
in
a
colourful
dream
the
curtain
went
up
and
here
was
the
hot
sunshiny
street
of
verona
and
all
the
heady
wine
of
youth
and
love
when
the
curtain
fell
and
the
lights
brightened
miss
bedford
after
frantically
applauding
claimed
laydon
for
her
own
she
had
raptures
to
impart
criticisms
to
exchange
knowledge
to
imbibe
minutes
passed
ere
during
a
momentary
lapse
into
her
programme
laydon
could
bend
toward
the
lady
on
his
left
did
she
like
it
what
did
she
think
of
juliet
what
did
she
think
of
romeo
was
it
not
hagar
did
not
know
whether
it
were
well
staged
or
not
she
was
eighteen
years
old
she
had
been
very
seldom
to
the
theatre
she
was
moving
through
a
dreamy
paradise
she
wanted
just
to
sit
still
and
bring
it
all
back
before
the
inner
eye
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
her
lover
she
was
not
sorry
when
laydon
must
turn
to
the
lady
on
his
right
when
lily
spoke
to
her
she
said
do
let
talk
let
sit
still
and
see
it
all
again
lily
agreed
she
was
no
chatterbox
herself
the
music
played
the
lights
in
the
house
were
lowered
up
slowly
gently
went
the
curtain
here
was
the
orchard
of
the
capulets
the
great
concave
of
the
theatre
was
dim
laydon
hand
sought
hagar
found
it
in
the
held
it
throughout
the
act
she
acquiesced
and
yet
and
yet
she
did
not
wish
him
to
fondle
her
hand
nor
yet
as
once
or
twice
he
did
to
whisper
to
her
she
wished
to
listen
listen
she
was
in
verona
not
here
the
act
closed
the
lights
went
up
laydon
softly
withdrew
his
hand
he
applauded
loudly
all
the
house
applauded
hagar
hated
the
clapping
not
experienced
enough
to
know
how
it
was
to
the
people
behind
the
curtain
already
the
curtain
was
rising
for
juliet
to
come
forth
and
bow
and
then
for
juliet
to
bring
forth
romeo
and
both
to
bow
had
she
known
she
would
have
applauded
too
she
was
a
kindly
child
the
curtain
was
down
now
the
house
rustling
all
around
was
talking
people
seemed
never
to
wish
to
be
quiet
laydon
was
talking
too
answering
miss
bedford
queries
embarking
on
a
commentary
upon
act
and
actors
he
talked
with
a
conscious
brilliance
as
became
a
professor
of
more
especially
for
delight
but
aware
also
that
the
people
directly
in
front
and
behind
were
listening
was
hagar
delighted
very
slowly
and
insidiously
like
a
slender
serpent
stealing
into
some
happy
valley
there
came
into
her
heart
a
distaste
for
commentaries
as
the
valley
might
be
ignorant
of
the
serpent
so
neither
did
she
know
what
was
the
matter
she
was
only
not
so
mystically
happy
as
she
had
been
before
the
orchestra
came
back
there
was
a
murmur
of
expectation
laydon
ceased
to
discourse
of
bandello
and
of
dante
reference
to
montague
and
capulet
lily
on
the
other
side
of
hagar
complained
of
the
heat
and
the
music
i
like
stringed
instruments
but
those
great
brass
horns
make
the
back
of
my
head
hurt
so
hagar
touched
her
cold
little
hand
poor
lily
i
wish
you
did
feel
badly
all
the
time
i
wish
you
liked
the
horns
the
curtain
rose
the
play
rolled
on
mercutio
was
slain
mercutio
and
tybalt
romeo
was
banished
the
scene
changed
and
here
was
the
great
window
of
juliet
room
the
rope
ladder
the
envious
east
candles
are
burned
out
and
jocund
day
stands
tiptoe
on
the
misty
i
must
be
gone
and
live
or
stay
and
hagar
sat
bent
forward
her
eyes
dark
and
wide
the
in
her
cheeks
when
the
curtain
went
down
she
did
not
move
laydon
under
cover
of
the
loud
applause
spoke
to
her
twice
before
she
attended
her
eyes
came
back
from
a
long
way
off
her
mind
turned
with
difficulty
yes
what
is
it
laydon
was
easily
aggrieved
you
are
thinking
more
of
this
wretched
play
he
whispered
than
you
are
of
me
on
rolled
the
swift
events
gorgeous
and
swift
as
shadows

with

found

striped

bag
that
laydon
could
not
find
they
all
passed
out
of
the
house
of
enchantments
here
was
the
night
and
the
night
wind
and
broken
lights
and
carriages
and
a
clamour
of
voices
and
at
last
the
clanging
with
a
great
freight
of
talking
people
she
wanted
to
sit
still
and
dream
it
over
and
fortunately
laydon
was
again
occupied
with
miss
bedford
you
liked
it
did
you
asked

i
think
that
you
like

that
you
imagine
better
than
you
like

you
do

looked
at

with

that
were
yet
wide
and
fixed
i
know
if
you
could
be
and
do
all
that
you
can
imagine
but
you
ca
you
ca
she
smiled
and
rubbed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
and
it
a
tragedy
when
they
left
the
and
walked
toward
the
eglantine
gates
it
was
drawing
toward
midnight
laydon
and
hagar
now
moved
side
by
side
through
the
darkness
lily
who
said
that
her
head
had
ached
very
little
thank
you
exchanged
comments
on
the
play
with
miss
bedford
laydon
held
the
gate
open
then
closing
it
fell
a
few
feet
behind
with
hagar
you
enjoyed
it
oh
he
was
again
in
love
the
plays
we
see
together
darling
darling
souls
with
but
a
single
thought
there
is
no
need
to
walk
so
fast
said
miss
bedford
oh
laydon
a
briar
has
caught
my
skirt
will

she
herself
opened
the

to

eyes
were
red
and
she
looked
frightened

she
said
and
got
between
the
little
group
and
the
parlour
door
lily
you
had
best
go
straight
upstairs
my
dear
miss
bedford
will
you
please
wait
here
with
me
just
a
minute
laydon
legrand
says
will
you
come
into
the
parlour
hagar
you
are
to
go
too
your
grandfather
is
here
colonel
ashendyne
stood
between
the
table
and
the
fire
legrand
was
seated
upon
the
sofa
which
meant
that
she
sat
in
state
lane
who
came
presently
stealing
in
again
sat
back
from
the
centre
in
a
meek
small
chair
and
at
intervals
wiped
her
eyes
the
culprits
stood
colonel
argall
ashendyne
never
lacked
words
with
which
to
express
his
meaning
words
that
bit
now
his
lips
opened
and
out
there
came
like
a
scimitar
his
part
of
the
ensuing
conversation
hagar
your
letter
was
read
yesterday
evening
i
immediately
telegraphed
to
legrand
at
idlewood
and
she
obligingly
took
this
morning
boat
i
myself
came
down
on
the
afternoon
train
and
got
here
two
hours
ago
now
sir
he
turned
on
laydon
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
i
i
began
laydon
he
drew
a
breath
and
his
spine
stiffened
i
have
to
say
sir
that
i
love
your
granddaughter
and
that
i
have
asked
her
to
marry
me
legrand
while
the
colonel
hawk
eye
dwelt
witheringly
spoke
from
the
sofa
i
have
no
words
laydon
in
which
to
express
my
disapproval
of
your
action
or
my
disappointment
in
one
whom
i
had
supposed
a
gentleman
in
my
absence
you
have
chosen
to
abuse
my
confidence
and
to
do
a
most
dishonourable
and
ungentlemanly
thing
a
thing
which
were
it
known
might
easily
bring
disrepute
upon
eglantine
you
will
understand
of
course
that
it
terminates
your
connection
with
this
school
legrand
said
laydon
i
have
done
nothing
dishonourable
you
have
taken
advantage
of
my
absence
sir
to
make
love
to
one
of
my
pupils
to
an
inexperienced
child
sir
said
the
colonel
too
young
to
know
better
or
to
tell
pinchbeck
when
she
sees
it
you
should
be
caned
colonel
ashendyne
if
you
were
a
younger
man
bah
said
the
colonel
i
am
younger
now
and
more
real
than
you
hagar
yes
grandfather
come
here
hagar
came
the
colonel
laid
his
hands
upon
her
shoulders
a
little
roughly
but
not
too
roughly
the
two
looked
each
other
in
the
eyes
he
was
tall
and
she
but
of
medium
height
she
was
young
and
he
was
her
elder
he
was
ancestor
and
she
descendant
he
was
her
supporter
and
she
his
dependant
he
was
grandfather
and
she
was
grandchild
gilead

had
always
inculcated

for

had
been

grievance
long
ago
against
her
mother
that
she
recognized
that
so
poorly
but
hagar
had
always
seemed
to
recognize
it
gipsy
said
the
colonel
now
i
am
not
going
to
be
hard
upon
you
it
the
nature
of
the
young
to
be
foolish
and
a
young
girl
may
be
pardoned
anything
short
of
the
irrecoverable
all
that
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
see
that
you
have
been
very
foolish
and
to
say
as
much
to
this
this
gentleman
simply
turn
round
and
say
to
him
what
his
name
layton
i
wrote
to
you
day
before
yesterday
colonel
ashendyne
said
laydon
you
saw
my
name
there
i
never
got
your
letter
sir
i
got
hagar
say
after
me
to
this
gentleman
i
was
mistaken
in
my
sentiment
toward
you
and
i
here
and
now
release
you
from
any
fancied
engagement
between
us
say
it
as
he
spoke
he
wheeled
her
so
that
she
faced
laydon
she
stood
a
scarlet
in
her
cheeks
her
eyes
dark
deep
and
angry
hagar
cried
laydon
maddened
too
are
you
going
to
say
that
no
answered
hagar
no
i
am
not
going
to
say
it
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
nor
underhand
and
neither
have
you
legrand
knew
that
you
were
coming
here
in
the
evening
to
read
to
us
why
you
come
well
one
evening
you
were
reading
and
i
was
listening
and
i
was
not
thinking
of
you
and
you
were
not
thinking
of
me
and
then
suddenly
something
love
came
into
this
room
and
took
us
prisoner
we
did
not
ask
him
here
we
did
not
know
anything
but
when
it
happened
we
knew
it
and
next
morning
out
in
the
open
air
we
told
each
other
about
it
nothing
could
have
kept
us
from
doing
that
and
nothing
had
a
right
to
keep
us
from
it
nothing
and
that
very
night
i
wrote
to
you
grandfather
and
he
wrote
if
i
am
mistaken
i
am
mistaken
but
i
will
find
it
out
for
myself
she
twisted
herself
in
the
grasp
until
she
faced
him
you
say
that
you
are
real
well
i
am
real
too
i
am
as
real
as
you
are
the
colonel
fine
bony
hands
closed
upon
her
shoulders
until
she
caught
her
breath
with
the
pain
the
water
rushed
to
her
eyes
but
she
kept
it
from
do
cry
said
a
voice
within
her
whatever
you
do
do
cry
it
was
like
her
mother
voice
and
she
answered
instantly
colonel
ashendyne
his
lips
white
beneath
his
grey
mustache
shook
her
violently
so
violently
that
pushed
from
her
footing
she
stumbled
and
sank
to
her
knee
laydon
came
up
with
clenched
fists
and
the
colour
gone
from
his
face
let
her
go
damn
you
lane
uttered
a
faint
cry
and
legrand
rose
from
the
sofa
chapter
x
gilead
balm
the
march
winds
shook
the
rusty
cedars
and
tossed
the
pink
peach
branches
and
carried
a
fleet
of
clouds
swiftly
overhead
through
the
blue
a√´rial
sea
they
rattled
the
windows
of
gilead
balm
and
bent
the
chimney
smoke
aslant
like
streamers
the
winds
were
rough
but
not
cold
now
and
again
they
sank
into
the
sunniest
of
calms
little
periods
of
stillness
small
doldrums
punctuating
the
stormiest
sentences
then
with
a
whistle
shriller
and
shriller
they
mounted
again
tremendously
exhilarated
sweeping
earth
and
sky
on
the
ridge
back
of
gilead
balm
the
buds
of
the
cucumber
tree
were
swelling
the
grass
beneath
was
growing
green
the
ants
were
out
in
the
sunshine
up
in
the
branches
a
bluebird
was
exploring
hagar
came
wandering
over
the
ridge
the
wind
wrapped
her
old
brown
dress
about
her
limbs
and
blew
her
dark
hair
into
locks
and
tendrils
luna
followed
her
but
luna
in
no
frolicsome
mood
luna
was
old
old
and
dispirited
because
captain
bob
had
gone
to
a
meeting
of
democrats
in
the
neighbouring
town
and
had
left
her
behind
depression
was
writ
in
every
line
of
luna
body
and
an
old
experienced
weariness
and
disillusionment
in
the
eye
with
which
she
looked
askance
at
a
white
butterfly
on
a
dandelion
hagar
stood
with
her
back
to
the
cucumber
tree
and
surveyed
the
scene
the
hills
scurried
over
by
the
shadows
of
the
driven
clouds
the
river
the
river
winding
down
to
the
sea
and
the
ditch
where
used
to
be
the
canal
and
away
away
the
white
plume
of
a
passenger
train
she
was
mad
for
travel
for
wandering
for
the
open
road
all
the
world
sung
to
her
as
with
a
thousand
tongues
in
the
books
she
read
pictures
cathedrals
statues
cities
snow
on
mountains
the
ocean
deserts
torrid
lands
france
spain
italy
england
oh
to
go
to
go
she
would
have
liked
to
fling
herself
on
the
blowing
wind
and
go
with
it
over
land
and
sea
she
looked
with
hot
sombre
eyes
at
gilead
balm
it
was
the
home
she
had
always
known
and
she
loved
it
it
was
home
yes
it
was
home
but
it
was
not
so
pleasant
at
home
just
now
march
and
the
colonel
had
withdrawn
her
from
eglantine
ordered
her
home
the
first
of
january
january
february
a
part
of
march
and
her
grandfather
still
eaten
with
a
cold
anger
every
time
he
looked
at
her
and
her
grandmother
outraged
at
her
suddenly
manifested
likeness
to
maria
and
ways
almost
as
bad
aunt
serena
gave
her
no
sympathy
aunt
serena
had
become
almost
violent
on
the
subject
if
you
were
going
to
rebel
and
disobey
aunt
serena
told
her
if
you
were
going
to
be
forward
and
almost
fast
and
rebel
and
disobey
you
need
look
for
any
sympathy
from
her
colonel
ashendyne
had
been
explicit
enough
back
in
january
when
you
send
about
his
business
that
person
you
chosen
to
entangle
yourself
with
then
and
not
till
then
will
you
be
again
to
me
hagar
put
out
her
arms
to
the
wind
i
want
to
go
away
i
want
to
go
away
i
tired
of
it
all
tired
of
living
here
the
wind
blew
past
her
with
its
long
cry
then
it
suddenly
sank
and
there
came
almost
a
of
bright
calm
warm
stillness
astral
gold
hagar
sat
down
between
the
roots
of
the
cucumber
tree
and
took
her
head
within
her
arms
by
degrees
in
the
sunshine
emotion
subsided
she
began
to
think
and
dream
her
mind
sent
the
shuttle
far
and
fast
it
touched
here
and
touched
there
and
in
the
course
of
its
weaving
it
touched
eglantine
touched
and
quit
and
touched
again
laydon
was
still
at
eglantine
he
had
been
a
very
satisfactory
professor
of
legrand
really
did
not
know
where
in
to
find
such
another
he
had
behaved
wretchedly
but
the
mischief
was
done
and
there
was
on
consideration
no
need
to
tell
the
world
about
it
no
especial
need
indeed
of
proclaiming
it
at
eglantine
or
to
eglantine
patrons
at
large
he
was
not
legrand
did
him
that
justice
he
was
not
at
all
a
fast
man
or
likely
to
give
further
trouble
upon
this
line
and
he
was
a
good
teacher
a
good
talker
in
demand
for
lectures
on
cultural
subjects
before
local
literary
societies
popular
and
pleasing
a
creditable
figure
among
the
eglantine
faculty
much
of
this
matter
was
probably
hagar
fault
she
had
made
eyes
at
him
little
fool
when
the
colonel
declared
his
determination
with
no
reflections
on
eglantine
my
dear
friend
to
bring
to
an
end
his
granddaughter
formal
education
and
to
take
her
back
to
gilead
balm
where
this
infatuation
would
soon
disappear
legrand
saw
daylight
she
had
an
interview
with
colonel
ashendyne
he
was
profoundly
contemptuous
of
what
laydon
did
for
a
living
or
where
he
did
it
of
whom
he
taught
or
what
he
taught
so
long
as
there
was
distance
between
him
and
an
ashendyne
you
know
you
know
my
dear
friend
that
i
have
always
had
in
mind
ralph
coltsworth
she
had
an
interview
concert
pitch
with
laydon
she
had
a
smooth
quiet
talk
with
her
teachers
she
mentioned
casually
to
one
after
another
of
the
girls
that
ashendyne
at
gilead
balm
was
not
as
young
as
she
had
been
nor
as
strong
and
that
colonel
ashendyne
thought
that
hagar
should
be
at
home
with
her
grandmother
she
legrand
regretted
it
but
every
girl
duty
to
her
family
was
paramount
they
would
miss
hagar
sadly
she
was
a
dear
girl
and
a
clever
girl
but
it
seemed
right
that
she
should
go
hagar
went
and
laydon
stayed
and
without
a
word
from
any
principal
in
the
affair
every
girl
at
eglantine
knew
that
laydon
had
kissed
hagar
and
that
hagar
had
said
that
she
would
love
him
forever
and
that
colonel
ashendyne
was
very
angry
and
was
probably
keeping
hagar
on
bread
and
water
at
that
instant
and
that
it
was
all
very
romantic
and
then
at
eglantine
examinations
came
on
and
dreams
of
easter
holiday
and
after
that
of
commencement
and
laydon
taught
with
an
entire
correctness
and
an
impassive
attitude
toward
all
young
ladies
and
miss
bedford
who
had
been
very
bitter
at
first
and
had
said
things
grew
amiable
again
and
reopened
her
browning
the
ripple
smoothed
out
as
all
things
smoothed
out
at
eglantine
the
place
resumed
its
pristine
sweetness
it
was
believed
among
the
girls
that
laydon
and
hagar
corresponded
but
it
was
not
certainly
known
laydon
wrapped
himself
in
dignity
as
in
a
mantle
as
for
hagar
she
had
always
been
rather
far
away
up
on
the
ridge
hagar
mind
dwelt
somewhat
on
eglantine
but
not
overmuch
it
was
not
precisely
eglantine
that
she
was
missing
was
she
missing
laydon
certainly
at
this
period
she
would
have
answered
that
she
was
though
to
be
perfectly
truthful
she
might
have
added
but
i
do
not
think
of
that
all
the
time
not
nearly
all
the
time
she
was
unhappy
and
on
occasions
her
fancy
brooded
over
that
night
in
the
eglantine
parlour
when
he
read
of
love
and
the
flames
became
jewelled
and
alive
and
she
saw
the
turret
on
the
plain
by
the
caper
overrooted
by
the
gourd
overscored
and
suddenly
a
warmth
and
light
wrapped
them
both
the
warmth
and
light
certainly
still
dwelt
over
that
scene
and
that
moment
to
a
lesser
extent
it
abided
over
and
around
the
next
morning
the
west
porch
the
syringa
alley
very
strangely
as
she
was
dimly
aware
it
stretched
only
thinly
over
the
following
days
over
even
the
night
of
romeo
and
juliet
there
was
there
a
mixed
and
wavering
light
changing
for
the
hour
that
immediately
followed
the
hour
when
she
faced
her
grandfather
and
he
spoke
with
knives
as
he
was
able
to
do
when
he
laid
his
hands
upon
her
and
said
untrue
and
unjust
things
to
laydon
into
an
angry
glow
that
hour
was
bright
and
hot
like
a
ruby
how
much
was
love
and
how
much
outraged
pride
and
a
burning
sense
of
wrong
she
was
not
skilled
to
know
nor
how
much
was
actual
chivalric
defence
of
her
partner
in
iniquity
the
parting
interview
when
she
and
laydon
having
stood
upon
their
rights
obtained
a
strange
in
the
eglantine
parlour
strange
and
stiff
with
of
course
if
i
love
you
i
be
faithful
repeated
on
her
part
some
five
times
with
on
his
part
byronic
fervour
volcanic
utterances
had
he
not
gone
over
them
to
himself
afterwards
in
his
homely
cheerfully
commonplace
room
in
the
brown
cottage
outside
the
eglantine
grounds
they
had
been
fine
from
the
point
of
view
of
they
could
not
have
been
bettered
he
felt
a
glow
as
he
recognized
that
fact
followed
by
a
mental
shot
at
the
great
seat
of
learning
where
he
wished
to
be
by
george
that
the
place
i
fitted
for
the
man
they
got
is
in
the
same
class
the
parting
interview
to
the
girl
on
the
ridge
a
cloud
seemed
to
hang
over
that
a
cloud
that
was
here
and
there
but
just
as
often
fading
into
grey
hagar
drove
her
thoughts
back
to
the
first
evening
and
the
jewelled
fire
that
was
a
clear
fair
memory
innocent
rich
and
sincere
the
others
had
so
strangely
a
certain
pain
and
dulness
she
had
a
sturdy
power
of
reaction
against
the
melancholy
and
the
painful
and
as
she
could
not
somehow
fix
her
mind
unswervingly
upon
the
one
clear
hour
and
the
others
perplexed
and
hurt
her
mind
at
last
turned
with
decision
from
any
contemplation
whatsoever
of
the
round
of
events
which
lay
behind
her
presence
here
in
march
upon
the
ridge
behind
gilead
balm
rising
she
left
the
cucumber
tree
and
walked
along
the
crest
of
the
ridge
the
wind
was
not
blowing
now
the
sunshine
was
very
golden
the
little
leaves
were
springing
she
crossed
the
plateau
to
its
northern
edge
and
stood
looking
down
that
slope
it
was
somewhat
heavily
wooded
and
in
shadow
it
fell
steeply
to
a
handsbreadth
of
sward
a
purling
streamlet
sunken
boulders
a
wide
thicket
and
a
wood
beyond
hagar
leaning
against
a
young
beech
gazed
down
the
shadowed
stillness
her
eyebrows
lifted
at
their
inner
ends
lines
came
into
her
forehead
wistful
markings
about
her
lips
sometimes
when
she
knew
that
she
was
quite
alone
she
spoke
aloud
to
her
self
she
did
this
now
i
been
here
since
that
day
it
happened
six
years
i
wonder
if
he
ran
away
again
or
if
he
stayed
there
to
the
end
i
wonder
where
he
is
now
six
years
the
wind
rose
and
blew
fiercely
rattling
in
the
thicket
and
bending
every
tree
then
it
sank
again
hagar
leaned
against
the
trunk
of
the
beech
and
thought
and
thought
as
a
child
she
had
been
speculative
everywhere
and
all
the
time
with
youth
had
come
dreams
and
imaginations
pushing
the
older
intense
querying
aside
now
of
a
sudden
a
leaf
was
turned
she
dreamed
and
imagined
still
but
the
thinker
within
her
rose
a
step
gained
a
foot
on
the
infinite
mounting
stair
hagar
began
to
brood
upon
the
state
of
the
world
black
and
white
stripes
like
a
zebra
how
petty
to
clothe
a
man
a
boy
he
was
then
like
that
mark
him
and
brand
him
until
through
life
he
sees
himself
striped
black
and
white
like
a
zebra
on
his
dying
bed
maybe
sees
himself
like
that
vindictive
and
the
world
sees
him
too
like
that
grotesque
and
mean
and
awful
and
it
can
not
cleanse
his
image
in
its
mind
it
is
foolish
the
wind
roared
again
up
and
down
the
ridge
hagar
shivered
and
began
to
move
toward
the
warmer
side
then
halted
turned
and
came
back
to
the
beech
i
not
go
away
until
the
sun
comes
from
under
that
cloud
and
the
wind
drops
it
like
leaving
him
alone
in
the
thicket
down
there
in
the
cold
and
shadow
she
waited
until
the
sun
came
out
and
the
wind
dropped
then
took
her
hand
from
the
beech
tree
and
went
away
leaving
the
ridge
she
came
to
the
overseer
house
hesitated
a
moment
then
went
and
knocked
at
the
kitchen
door
come
in
called
green
who
was
sitting
by
the
kitchen
table
in
the
patch
of
sunlight
before
the
window
sewing
together
strips
of
bright
cloth
and
winding
them
into
balls
for
a
rag
carpet
you
hagar
come
right
in
well
march
is
surely
going
out
like
a
lion
it
so
windy
that
the
clouds
are
running
like
sheep
said
hagar
she
took
a
small
drew
it
near
green
and
began
to
wind
carpet
rags
red
and
blue
and
grey
it
going
to
be
a
beautiful
carpet

eden
mus√©e

and
she
going
to
visit

hagar
read
five
pages
of
lined
notepaper
all
covered
with
pretty
precise
writing
she
having
a
good
time
i
wish

gettin
harder
right
along
instead

girls

got
to
go
out
in
the
world
and
work
nowadays
just
the
same
as
boys
i
do
know
as
it
will
hurt
them
anyway
they
got
to
do
it
food
an
clothes
do
ask
which
sect
you
belong
to
thomasine
ought
to
have
gone
to
school
girls

go
to
college
now
and
thomasine
and
i
both

to
have
gone
to
college
landsake
said
green
ai
you
been
to
college
for
going
on
three
years
but
hagar
shook
her
head
no
eglantine
was
exactly
a
college
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
a
different
kind
of
place
thomasine
likes
books
too
yes
she
likes
them
but
she
do
like
them
nothing
like
as
much
as
you
do
but
thomasine
a
good
child
and
mighty
refined
i
hope
take
pains
to
get
her
a
place
where
they
are
nice
people
he
means
all
right
but
there
men
do
never
quite
understand
i
wish
i
could
earn
money
said
hagar
i
wish
i
could
green
regarded
her
over
her
spectacles
a
lot
of
women
have
wished
that
child
a
lot
of
women
have
wished
it
and
then
again
a
lot
of
women
have
wished
it
some
would
rather
do
for
themselves
an
for
others
an
some
would
rather
be
did
for
and
that
the
world
noticed
it
in
men
too
it
in
my
head
all
the
time
i
think
mother
put
it
there
yes
i
know
said
green
a
lot
of
us
have
felt
that
way
but
it
ai
so
easy
for
women
to
make
money
there
more
ways
they
than
they
can
it
what
they
call
fights
them
sentiment
do
mind
their
being
industrious
but
it
draws
the
line
at
their
getting
money
for
it
it
says
it
ought
to
be
a
free
gift
it
grudge
at
least
it
do
grudge
much
a
little
egg
and
butter
money
but
anything
more
lord
she
sewed
together
two
strips
of
blue
flannel
no
it
ai
easy
and
a
woman
kind
of
gets
discouraged
she
put
her
ambition
to
sleep
so
often
that
now
with
most
of
them
it
seems
asleep
for
keeps
them
that
industrious
do
expect
to
rise
or
anything
to
come
of
it
and
them
that
lazy
gets
lazier
it
a
funny
world
for
there
a
lot
of
brown
strips
in
the
basket
there
i
going
to
tell
you
what
i
done
said
hagar
winding
a
red
ball
i
written
a
fairy
story
but
i
do
suppose
it
will
be
taken
i
always
knew
you
could
write
said
green
a
fairy
story
what
it
about
about
fairies
and
a
boy
and
a
girl
and
a
lovely
land
they
found
by
going
neither
north
nor
south
nor
east
nor
west
and
what
they
did
there
it
seemed
to
me
right
good
said
hagar
wistfully
but
i
sent
it
off
a
month
ago
and
i
never
heard
a
word
about
it
where
did
you
send
it
i
never
did
know
said
green
how
what
people
writes
gets
printed
and
bound
it
do
do
it
just
of
itself
hagar
leaned
forward
in
her
her
cheeks
were
carmine
and
her
eyes
soft
and
bright
the
people
home
offered
three
prizes
for
the
three
best
stories
stories
that
it
could
publish
and
i
thought
not
i
as
well
as
another
and
so
i
wrote
a
fairy
story
and
sent
it
the
first
prize
is
two
hundred
dollars
and
the
second
prize
is
one
hundred
dollars
and
the
third
is
fifty
if
i
could
get
even
the
third
prize
i
would
be
happy
i
should
think
you
would
exclaimed
green
fifty
dollars
i
do
know
as
i
ever
saw
fifty
dollars
all
in
one
lump
exceptin
war
money
when
are
you
going
to
hear
i
do
know
i
afraid
i
wo
ever
hear
i
afraid
it
good
enough
not
even
good
enough
for
them
to
write
to
me
and
say
it
would
do
and
tell
me
why
well
i
would
give
up
hope
said
green
it
my
motto
to
carry
hope
right
spang
through
the
grave
she
rose
fed
the
fire
and
filled
the
then
returned
to
her
rag
carpet
you
a
little
thin
child
do
let
them
worry
you
up
at
the
house
i
not
answered
hagar
sombrely
the
light
went
out
of
her
eyes
she
stitched
slowly
drawing
her
thread
through
with
deliberation
green
again
looked
over
her
spectacles
they
mighty
fine
folk
the
ashendynes
she
said
at
last
they
got
old
blood
and
pride
for
a
dozen
and
the
settest
heads
ai
nothin
daunts
them
neither
satan
nor
the
lord

to

at
times

a
dash
of
coltsworth
too

i
anything
of
my
father
at
all
green
leaning
forward
into
the
sunlight
threaded
her
needle
i
would
be
bitter
about
my
father
if
i
were
you
people
can
be
born
without
a
sense
of
obligation
and
responsibility
just
as
they
can
be
born
without
other
senses
i
suppose
it
there
somewhere
only
so
many
other
things
are
atop
it
ai
hardly
ever
stirred
your
right
rich
in
other
things
he
so
poor
he
could
either
truly
love
my
mother
or
truly
let
her
but
i
did
mean
to
talk
about
him
said
hagar
she
laid
the
ball
she
had
been
winding
in
the
basket
with
the
other
balls
and
stood
up
stretching
her
young
arms
above
her
head

to
the
wind
i
wish
it
would
blow
me
away
neither
north
nor
south

chapter
xi
the
letters
miss
serena
was
playing
silvery
waves
hagar
kneeling
on
the
warmed
her
hands
at
the
fire
and
studied
the
illuminated
text
over
the
mantel
silvery
waves
came
to
an
end
and
miss
serena
opened
the
green
at
santa
anna
march
has
isham
gone
for
the
mail
asked
hagar
yes
he
went
an
hour
you
hoping
i
suppose
for
a
letter
from
that
dreadful
man
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
said
hagar
that
i
gave
my
word
and
he
gave
his
to
write
only
once
a
month
and
he
is
a
dreadful
man
just
like
everybody
else
ha
said
miss
serena
and
brought
her
hands
down
upon
the
opening
chord
hagar
her
elbows
on
her
knees
hid
her
eyes
in
her
hands
within
her
consciousness
juliet
was
speaking
as
she
had
spoken
that
night
upon
the
stage
spoken
in
the
book
spoken
in
immortal
life
youth
love
not
so
she
knew
with
a
suddenness
and
clangour
as
of
a
falling
city
not
so
could
juliet
have
spoken
like
everybody
else
was
laydon
then
truly
like
everybody
else
a
horror
of
weakness
and
fickleness
came
over
her
was
there
something
direfully
wrong
with
her
nature
or
was
it
possible
for
people
simply
to
be
mistaken
in
such
a
matter
her
head
grew
tired
she
was
so
unhappy
that
she
wished
to
creep
away
and
weep
and
weep
miss
serena
having
marched
with
santa
anna
turned
a
dozen
pages
and
began
the
mocking
bird
with
variations
old
miss
step
was
heard
in
the
hall
very
firm
and
authoritative
in
a
moment
she
entered
the
room
portly
not
perceptibly
aged
her
hair
beneath
her
cap
hardly
more
than
powdered
with
grey
still
wearing
black
stuff
gowns
and
white
aprons
and
heelless
low
shoes
over
white
stockings
hagar
rose
from
the
rug
and
pushed
the
big
chair
toward
the
fire
old
miss
dropped
into
it
no
not
dropped
lowered
herself
with
dignity
has
isham
brought
the
mail
no
not
yet
i
dreamed
last
night
that
there
was
a
letter
from
medway
serena
yes
mother
the
next
text
you
paint
i
want
you
to
do
one
for
me
thy
father
and
mother
that
thy
days
may
be
miss
serena
turned
on
the
i
do
it
right
away
mother
it
would
be
lovely
in
blue
and
gold
you
ca
say
that
i
honoured
father
and
mother
old
miss
had
drawn
out
her
knitting
and
now
her
needles
clicked
no
one
honours
them
as
they
used
to
be
honoured
no
one
obeys
them
as
they
used
to
obey
children
think
that
they
are
wiser
than
their
fathers
they
set
up
to
use
their
own
judgment
until
it
a
scandal
it
true
you
been
better
than
most
serena
taking
you
year
in
and
year
out
you
obeyed
the
commandment
it
more
than
many
daughters
and
that
i
know
have
done
her
needles
clicked
again
yes
serena
you
have
given
us
much
trouble
you
were
easy
to
make
mind
from
the
beginning
she
gave
the
due
praise
but
her
tone
was
not
without
acerbity
it
might
almost
have
seemed
that
such
forthright
ductility
and
keeping
of
the
commandment
as
had
been
miss
serena
had
its
side
of
annoyance
and
satiety
hagar
spoke
from
the
window
where
she
stood
her
forehead
pressed
against
the
glass
i
see
isham
down
the
road
by
the
cedar
old
miss
turned
the
heel
of
the
colonel
sock
she
was
knitting
things
that
from
the
newspaper
and
my
personal
observation
happen
now
in
the
world
could
not
possibly
have
occurred
when
i
was
young
people
defying
their
betters
women
deserting
their
natural
sphere
atheists
denying
hell
and
saying
that
the
world
was
made
in
six
days
young
girls
talking
about
independence
and
their
own
lives
their
own
lives
ha
miss
serena
began
to
play
the
sea
in
the
shell
we
all
know
how
hagar
came
by
her
disposition
but
i
must
say
it
is
an
unfortunate
one
when
i
was
her
age
no
money
could
have
made
me
act
as
she
has
done
no
money
could
have
made
me
either
spoke
hagar
at
the
window
money
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
old
miss
at
least
as
far
as
hagar
is
concerned
nothing
but
fitness
propriety
meekness
and
modesty
consultation
with
those
to
whom
she
owes
duty
and
bowing
to
what
they
say
all
those
have
something
to
do
with
it
but
what
could
you
expect
it
was
bound
to
come
out
some
day
from
a
bush
with
thorns
will
come
a
bush
with
thorns
here
is
isham
said
hagar
if
you
said
enough
for
grandmother
shall
i
get
the
mail
she
brought
the
bag
to
her
grandmother
when
the
colonel
was
at
home
no
one
else
opened
the
small
leather
pouch
and
distributed
its
contents
when
he
was
away
old
miss
performed
the
ceremony
he
had
mounted
selim
and
ridden
to
the
meeting
in
the
neighbouring
town
ashendyne
opened
the
bag
and
sorted
the
mail
there
was
no
great
amount
of
it
but
i
said
so
i
dreamed
it
my
dreams
often
come
true
there
it
is
it
was
a
square
letter
quite
thick
addressed
in
a
rather
striking
hand
and
bearing
a
foreign
stamp
and
postmark
it
was
addressed
to
the
colonel
and
ashendyne
never
opened
the
letters
not
even
when
they
were
from
medway
they
were
not
from
him
very
often
the
last
and
that
thin
between
the
fingers
had
been
in
september
this
one
was
so
much
thicker
than
that
one
old
miss
gazed
at
it
with
greedy
eyes
miss
serena
too
leaving
the
came
to
her
mother
side
and
fingered
the
letter
he
must
have
had
a
lot
to
write
about
from
paris
i
used
to
want
to
go
to
paris
so
much
put
it
on
the
mantelpiece
said
old
miss
it
ca
be
long
before
the
colonel
home
even
when
it
was
on
the
she
still
sat
looking
at
it
with
devouring
eyes
i
dreamed
it
was
coming
and
there
it
is
the
remainder
of
the
mail
waited
under
her
wrinkled
hand
miss
serena
grew
mildly
impatient
what
else
is
there
mother
looking
for
a
letter
about
those
embroidery
silks
there
it
is
now
i
think
she
drew
from
her
mother
lap
an
envelope
with
a
printed
return
address
in
the
upper
corner
no
it
is
it
people
home
magazine
some
advertisement
or
other
people
pay
a
lot
to
tell
people
about
things
they
do
want
hagar
here
hagar
it
evidently
does
know
that
you
are
grown
up
or
think
you
are
there
my
letter
mother
under
the
hagar
went
away
with
the
communication
from
the
young
people
home
magazine
in
her
hand
she
went
upstairs
to
her
own
room
it
had
been
her
mother
room
she
slept
in
the
bed
on
which
maria
had
died
and
she
curled
herself
with
a
book
in
the
corner
of
the
flowered
chintz
sofa
as
maria
had
done
before
her
she
curled
herself
here
though
with
the
letter
not
with
a
book
the
letter
lay
upon
her
knees
she
looked
at
it
with
a
fixed
countenance
hardly
breathing
she
had
thought
herself
out
of
a
deal
of
the
conventional
and
materialized
religious
ideas
of
her
world
not
out
of
religion
but
out
of
conventional
religion
she
did
not
often
pray
now
for
rewards
or
benefits
or
hiatuses
in
the
common
law
or
for
a
salvation
external
to
her
own
being
but
at
this
moment
the
past
reasserted
itself
her
lips
moved
o
god
let
it
have
been
taken
o
god
let
it
have
been
taken
let
me
have
won
the
fifty
dollars
let
me
have
won
the
third
prize
o
god
let
it
have
been
taken
at
last
her
courage
at
the
she
opened
the
envelope
and
unfolded
the
letter
within
the
typewritten
words
swam
before
her
eyes
the
dear
madam
the
page
or
two
that
followed
the
with
congratulations
we
are
faithfully
yours
there
was
an
enclosure
a
cheque
she
touched
it
with
trembling
fingers
it
said
pay
to
miss
hagar
ashendyne
the
sum
of
two
hundred
dollars
an
hour
later
the
sounding
she
went
downstairs
the
colonel
and
captain
bob
were
yet
at
the
meeting
of
democrats
there
was
to
be
a
public
dinner
they
would
not
be
home
before
dusk
the
three
women
ate
alone
dilsey
waiting
old
miss
was
preoccupied
the
letter
on
the
parlour
mantelpiece
filled
her
mind
from
paris
in
september
he
was
at
a
place
called
dinard
miss
serena
had
her
mind
upon
a
panel
calla
lilies
and
mignonette
which
she
was
painting
for
the
rectory
parlour
as
for
hagar
she
did
not
talk
much
nowadays
at
gilead
balm
if
she
were
more
silent
than
usual
it
passed
without
notice
only
once
old
miss
remarked
upon
her
appearance
hagar
you
got
a
dazed
look
about
the
eyes
are
you
feeling
badly
no
grandmother
you
not
to
get
ill
child
i
shall
make
a
bottle
of
tansy
bitters
morning
we
trouble
enough
in
this
family
without
your
losing
colour
and
getting
circles
round
your
eyes
that
was
love
and
kindness
from
old
miss
the
water
came
into
eyes
she
felt
a
desire
to
tell
her
grandmother
and
aunt
serena
about
the
letter
but
in
another
moment
it
was
gone
her
whole
inner
life
was
by
now
secret
from
them
and
this
seemed
of
the
inner
life
presently
of
course
she
would
deliberately
tell
them
all
she
had
thought
it
out
and
determined
that
it
would
be
after
supper
before
uncle
bob
went
to
bed
and
grandfather
told
her
to
get
the
it
seemed
so
wonderful
a
thing
to
her
she
was
so
awed
by
it
that
she
could
not
help
the
feeling
that
it
would
be
wonderful
to
them
too
in
the
afternoon
she
put
a
cape
around
her
left
the
home
hill
and
went
down
the
lane
skirted
a
ploughed
field
and
crossing
the
river
road
came
immediately
to
the
fringe
of
sycamores
and
willows
upon
the
river
bank
it
was
warmer
and
stiller
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
for
the
voice
of
the
wind
there
sounded
now
the
voice
of
the
river
the
many
boughs
above
were
still
against
the
sky
she
made
for
a
great
sycamore
that
she
had
known
from
childhood
it
had
a
vast
protuberant
curving
root
in
whose
embrace
you
could
sit
as
in
an
armchair
she
sat
there
now
and
looked
at
the
river
that
went
so
swiftly
by
it
was
swollen
with
the
spring
rains
it
made
a
deep
noise
going
by
to
the
distant
sea
to
hagar
its
voice
was
at
once
solemn
and
jubilant
strong
and
stirred
from
depth
to
surface
she
had
with
her
the
letter
how
many
times
she
had
read
it
she
could
not
have
told
she
could
have
said
it
by
heart
but
still
she
wanted
to
read
it
to
touch
it
to
become
aware
of
meaning
under
meaning
she
could
write
she
could
tell
stories
she
could
write
books
she
could
earn
money
it
was
one
of
the
moments
of
her
life
the
moment
when
she
knew
of
her
mother
death
the
moment
when
she
changed
gilead
balm
for
eglantine
the
moment
by
the
fire
christmas
eve
this
moment
she
was
but
eighteen
the
turns
in
her
road
of
this
life
had
not
been
many
this
was
one
and
a
main
one
suddenly
to
herself
her
life
achieved
purpose
direction
it
was
as
though
a
rudderless
boat
had
been
suddenly
mended
or
a
bewildered
helmsman
had
seen
the
pole
star
she
sat
in
the
embrace
of
the
sycamore
her
feet
lightly
resting
on
the
spring
earth
her
shoulders
just
touching
the
pale
bark
of
the
tree
her
arms
folded
her
eyes
level
poised
recollected
as
a
young
brahman
conscious
of
an
expanded
space
a
deeper
time
how
long
she
sat
there
she
did
not
know
the
sun
slipped
lower
touched
her
knees
with
gold
she
sighed
at
last
raised
her
hands
and
turned
her
body
what
perhaps
had
roused
her
was
the
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
upon
the
river
road
at
any
rate
she
now
marked
a
black
horse
coming
in
the
distance
down
the
road
by
the
speckled
sycamores
it
came
on
with
a
gay
sound
upon
the
earth
and
in
its
rider
she
presently
recognized
her
cousin
ralph
coltsworth
what
are
you
doing
here
she
asked
when
he
reined
in
the
black
horse
beside
her
why
are
you
at
the
university
with
blackstone
under
your
arm
he
dismounted
fastened
his
horse
and
came
across
to
the
sycamore
root
it
big
enough
for
two
is
it
he
asked
and
sat
down
facing
her
you
mentioned
the
university
the
university
bless
its
old
heart
does
appreciate
me
ralph
have
you
been
expelled
suspended
hands
behind
head
he
regarded
first
the
blue
sky
behind
the
interlaced
bare
branches
then
the
tall
and
great
gnarled
trunk
then
the
figure
of
his
cousin
enthroned
before
him
the
suspense
he
said
is
exquisite
what
did
you
do
he
grimaced
i
do
remember
why
talk
about
it
it
was
much
cakes
and
ale
de
chimes
at
midnight
same
old
song
he
laughed
i
gather
that
you
been
rusticated
too
hagar
winced
do
let
laugh
about
other
things
you
break
your
family
hearts
at
hawk
nest
old
miss
said
in
a
letter
which
mother
showed
me
that
you
were
breaking
hers
what
kind
of
a
fellow
is
he
hagar
like
me
hagar
looked
at
him
gravely
not
in
the
least
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
at
hawk
nest
oh
a
month
i
coming
to
see
you
every
other
day
are
you
i
am
if
i
could
draw
i
like
to
draw
you
just
as
you
look
now
half
marquise
half
dryad
sitting
before
your
own
front
door
well

ca

said
hagar
and
it
getting
cold
and
the
dryad
is
going
home
all
right
said
ralph
i
going
too
i
come
to
spend
the
night
leading
his
horse
he
walked
beside
her
in
the
green
lane
a
wintry
sunset
glory
over
every
slope
and
distant
wood
the
house
between
its
black
cedars
rising
before
them
he
halted
a
moment
i
have
seen
you
since
august
when
i
rode
over
to
tell
gilead
balm
changed
you
growed
that
may
be
i
grown
since
i
came
no
before
you
came
for
the
first
time
i
suppose
in
your
life
grandmother
is
going
to
be
sorry
to
see
you
she
worships
you
she
was
sorry
to
see
you
too
was
she
it
rather
nice
to
be
companions
out
of
favour
oh
cried
hagar
you
are
and
always
were
the
most
provoking
twister
of
the
truth
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
i
do
not
consider
that
ours
are
similar
cases
and
now
if
you
please
that
is
the
last
word
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
on
such
a
matter
all
right
said
ralph
i
was
curious
of
course
but
i
acknowledge
your
right
to
shut
me
up
they
passed
through
the
home
gate
where
a
boy
took
his
horse
and
went
up
the
hill
together
dilsey
was
lighting
the
lamps
as
they
entered
the
hall
miss
serena
came
out
of
the
library
miss
serena
looking
curiously
agitated
dilsey
has
miss
hagar
come
in
yet
oh
hagar
i
been
searching
the
place
for
you
why
ralph
where
on
earth
did
you
come
from
has
the
university
burned
down
have
you
got
a
holiday
the
library
door
was
ajar
the
colonel
voice
made
itself
heard
from
within
serena
is
that
hagar
tell
her
to
come
here
the
three
entered
the
room
together
there
was
a
slight
clamour
of
surprise
and
greeting
from
its
occupants
for
ralph
but
it
died
down
in
the
face
as
it
were
of
things
of
greater
importance
what
the
matter
he
asked
bringing
up
at
last
by
captain
bob
in
the
background
a
letter
from
medway
answered
the
other
the
evenings
falling
cold
there
was
a
fire
upon
the
hearth
the
was
lit
all
the
room
was
in
a
glow
that
caressed
the
stiff
portraits
the
old
mahogany
and
horsehair
furniture
the
bookcases
and
the
books
within
in
the
smaller
of
the
two
great
chairs
by
the
hearth
sat
old
miss
preternaturally
straight
her
hands
folded
on
the
black
silk
apron
which
she
donned
in
the
evening
her
still
comely
face
and
head
rising
from
the
narrow
very
fine
embroidered
collar
fastened
by
an
oval
brooch
in
which
in
a
complicated
pattern
was
wrought
the
hair
of
dead
coltsworths
and
hardens
her
face
wore
a
look
at
once
softened
and
fixed
across
from
her
in
the
big
chair
by
the
sat
colonel
ashendyne
a
little
greyer
a
little
more
hawklike
of
nose
a
little
sparer
in
frame
as
the
years
went
by
but
emphatically
not
a
person
to
whom
could
be
applied
the
term
old
there
breathed
from
him
still
an
insolent
determined
prime
a
timelessness
a
pictorial
quality
as
of
some
gallery
masterpiece
with
the
of
his
yet
plentiful
hair
his
mustache
and
imperial
the
racer
set
of
his
head
his
jaw
and
long
nervous
hands
his
fine
long
spare
figure
and
his
eye
in
which
a
certain
bladelike
keenness
and
cynicism
warred
with
native
sensuousness
he
stayed
in
the
memory
like
such
a
canvas
his
mood
always
showed
through
him
though
somewhat
cloudily
like
light
through
a
venetian
glass
that
it
was
a
mixed
and
curious
mood
hagar
felt
the
moment
she
was
in
the
room
she
did
not
always
like
her
grandfather
but
she
usually
understood
him
she
saw
the
letter
that
had
rested
on
the
mantelpiece
the
letter
from
paris
in
his
hand
and
at
once
there
came
over
her
a
curious
foreboding
she
did
not
know
whether
of
good
or
evil
sit
down
said
the
colonel
i
have
something
to
read
to
you
for
two
months
and
more
he
had
not
looked
at
her
without
anger
in
his
eyes
the
cloud
seemed
at
least
partly
to
have
gone
by
there
was
even
in
the
colonel
tone
a
touch
of
blandness
of
enjoyment
of
the
situation
she
sat
down
wondering
her
eyes
upon
the
letter
on
occasion
when
she
searched
her
heart
through
she
found
but
a
shrivelled
love
for
her
father
except
that
he
had
had
in
giving
her
life
she
really
did
not
know
what
she
had
to
love
him
for
now
however
what
power
of
growth
there
was
in
the
root
broke
the
soil
she
began
to
tremble
what
is
the
matter
is
father
ill
is
he
coming
home
not
immediately
said
the
colonel
no
he
is
not
ill
he
appears
to
be
in
his
usual
health
and
to
exhibit
his
usual
good
spirits
your
grandmother
and
i
were
fortunate
in
having
a
son
of
a
disposition
so
happy
that
he
left
all
clouds
and
difficulties
including
his
own
to
other
people
at
the
proper
moment
he
has
always
been
able
to
find
a
no
medway
is
well
and
apparently
happy
he
has
remarried
remarried
it
was
the
colonel
intention
to
read
her
the
letter
indeed
it
carried
an
inclosure
for
her
as
he
had
already
read
it
twice
with
varying
comment
to
the
others
assembled
but
he
chose
to
make
first
his
own
introduction
you
heard
of
the
cat
that
always
falls
on
its
feet
well
that
your
father
gipsy
even
in
the
whirl
of
the
moment
hagar
could
not
but
note
that
he
called
her
gipsy
medway
here
a
careless
ungrateful
disobedient
son
utterly
reckless
of
his
obligations
is
he
hanged
or
struck
by
lightning
not
he
he
goes
happily
along
master
he
makes
a
disastrous
marriage
with
a
penniless
remnant
of
a
family
on
some
lost
coast
or
other
and
brings
her
home
and
presently
there
a
child
does
he
undertake
to
support
them
stay
by
his
bargain
however
poor
a
one
not
he
he
got
a
tiny
income
in
his
own
right
left
him
by
his
maternal
grandfather
just
enough
with
care
for
one
off
he
goes
with
that
in
his
pocket
and
a
wealthy
friend
and
from
that
day
to
this
we
have
laid
eyes
on
prince
fortunatus
well
what
happens
does
he
come
to
eating
husks
with
the
swine
and
so
at
last
slink
back
not
he
he
enjoys
life
he
free
and
footloose
he
put
his
burden
on
other
folk
backs
death
comes
along
and
unmakes
his
marriage
his
doting
mother
and
his
weak
father
apparently
are
prepared
to
charge
themselves
with
the
maintenance
of
his
child
why
should
he
trouble
he
does
not
in
the
least
he
got
just
enough
in
his
own
right
to
let
him
wander
over
creation
if
he
took
the
least
care
of
another
he
could
wander
and
he
likes
to
wander
ah
i
understand
medway
from
hair
to
heel
what
comes
of
it
all
we
used
to
believe
in
nemesis
but
that
like
other
beliefs
is
going
by
the
board
is
he
going
to
suffer
not
at
all
he
remains
the
cat
that
falls
every
time
upon
its
this
gipsy
is
the
letter
dear
father
and
mother
as
well
as
i
can
remember
i
was
staying
at
dinard
when
i
last
wrote
you
i
was
there
because
of
the
presence
in
that
charming
place
of
a
lady
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
the
previous
year
at
from
dinard
i
followed
her
in
november
to
nice
and
from
nice
to
italy
i
spent
a
portion
of
february
as
her
guest
in
her
villa
near
sorrento
and
there
matters
were
brought
to
a
conclusion
i
proposed
marriage
and
she
accepted
we
were
married
a
week
ago
in
rome
in
the
english
church
before
a
large
company
the
american
minister
giving
her
away
there
were
matters
to
be
arranged
with
her
banker
and
lawyer
in
paris
and
so
despite
the
fact
that
march
is
a
detestable
month
in
this
city
we
immediately
came
on
here
later
we
shall
be
in
brittany
and
we
talk
of
norway
for
the
lady
whom
i
have
married
was
the
widow
of
the
noted
financier
and
railroad
magnate
she
is
something
under
my
own
age
accomplished
attractive
handsome
and
possessed
of
a
boundless
good
nature
and
a
benevolent
heart
we
understand
each
nature
and
expect
to
be
happy
together
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
being
who
she
is
she
has
extreme
wealth
if
you
read
the
papers
i
do
not
you
may
perhaps
recall
that
will
left
his
millions
to
her
absolutely
without
condition
there
were
no
children
to
close
this
matter
she
has
been
generous
to
a
degree
in
insisting
that
certain
settlements
be
made
it
leaves
me
with
a
personal
financial
independence
and
assurance
of
which
of
course
i
never
dreamed
i
have
often
regretted
that
i
have
been
able
to
do
so
little
for
you
or
for
the
upkeep
of
dear
old
gilead
balm
this
in
the
future
may
be
rectified
i
understand
that
you
have
had
to
raise
money
upon
the
place
and
i
wish
you
would
let
me
know
the
the
colonel
eyes
darted
cold
fire
he
let
the
sheet
fall
for
the
moment
and
turned
upon
hagar
sitting
motionless
on
the
ottoman
by
the
fire
damn
your
father
impertinence
gipsy
he
said
old
miss
spoke
in
a
soft
and
gentle
voice
why
do
you
call
it
that
colonel
medway
always
had
a
better
heart
than
he
ever
been
given
credit
for
why
should
he
help
now
that
he
can
do
so
it
greatly
to
his
credit
that
he
should
write
that
way
sarah
said
the
colonel
you
are
a
mother
captain
bob
spoke
from
beyond
the
table
captain
bob
did
not
often
speak
nor
often
with
especial
weight
but
he
had
been
pondering
this
matter
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
and
he
had
a
certain
kind
of
common
sense
i
think
sarah
right
medway
a
curiosity
to
me
but
i
always
held
that
he
was
born
that
way
you
are
you
know
born
so
or
you
are
born
so
he
pretty
consistent
there
never
was
a
time
when
i
would
have
said
that
he
would
come
to
the
fore
just
as
soon
as
he
did
have
to
deny
himself
now
the
time
come
and
here
he
is
i
think
sarah
right
forgive
and
forget
if
he
wants
to
pay
his
debts
and
god
knows
he
owes
you
and
sarah
a
lot
i
let
him
and
as
to
gipsy
there
better
late
than
never
read
her
what
he
says
i
am
going
to
said
the
colonel
sardonically
he
read
the
page
that
remained
then
laid
the
letter
on
the
table
put
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
regarded
his
granddaughter
the
benevolent
parent
arrived
at
last
upon
the
scene
a
kindly
disposed
stepmother
with
millions
and
that
teacher
of
surface
culture
to
young
ladies
at
eglantine
among
the
three
you
ought
to
be
quite
ideally
provided
for
i
hope
medway
will
like
the
teacher
old
miss
came
unexpectedly
to
her
granddaughter
aid
do
worry
her
colonel
i
have
thought
her
looking
well
give
her
her
letter
and
let
her
go
and
think
it
out
quietly
by
if
you
like
child
phoebe
shall
bring
you
your
supper
hagar
did
like
oh
would
like
that
thank
you
grandmother
very
much
she
took
the
letter
it
was
addressed
to
her
in
a
hand
which
her
father
had
enclosed
and
which
her
grandfather
now
held
out
to
her
and
went
away
feeling
somewhat
blindly
for
the
door
leaving
the
others
staring
after
her
upstairs
she
lit
her
lamp
and
placed
it
on
maria
table
by
maria
couch
then
curled
there
against
the
pillows
they
were
in
a
pattern
of
tulips
and
roses
she
read
the
very
kind
letter
which
her
stepmother
had
written
chapter
xii
a
meeting
the
new
springs
had
been
so
christened
about
a
hundred
years
before
when
a
restless
pioneer
family
had
moved
westward
and
upward
from
the
old
springs
thirty
miles
away
at
the
foot
of
the
great
range
the
new
springs
had
been
a
and
apparently
from
the
number
of
arrowheads
forever
being
unearthed
a
known
region
to
the
indians
now
the
indians
were
gone
and
the
deer
fast
fast
withdrawing
occasionally
buck
or
doe
was
shot
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
phantoms
of
the
past
so
with
the
bear
who
used
to
come
down
to
the
corncribs
in
the
lonely
clearings
bear
mountain
still
rose
dark
blue
like
a
wall
and
the
stark
cliff
called
bear
den
caught
the
first
ray
of
the
sun
but
the
bears
themselves
were
seldom
seen
they
also
were
phantoms
of
the
past
but
the
fish
stayed
in
the
mountain
streams
there
were
many
streams
and
many
fish
bright
speckled
mountain
trout
darting
and
flashing
among
pools
and
cascades
now
seen
in
the
sunlight
now
lurking
by
rocks
in
the
shadow
of
the
dark
hemlock
spruce
the
region
was
fisherman
paradise
it
was
almost
an
climb
from
the
nearest
railway
station
to
the
new
springs
you
took
the
stage
in
the
first
freshness
of
the
morning
you
went
gaily
along
for
a
few
miles
through
a
fair
grazing
country
then
the
stage
began
to
climb
and
it
climbed
and
climbed
until
you
wondered
where
and
when
the
thing
was
going
to
stop
every
now
and
then
driver
and
passengers
got
down
and
walked
here
it
was
shady
with
wonderful
banks
of
rhododendron
with
ferns
and
overhanging
trees
and
here
it
was
sunny
and
hot
with
the
wood
scrub
or
burned
and
the
only
interesting
growth
huckleberries
and
huckleberries
and
huckleberries
dwarf
under
the
blazing
sun
with
butterflies
flitting
over
them
up
here
you
had
wonderful
views
you
saw
a
sea
of
mountains
tremendous
motionless
waves
the
orb
as
it
had
wrinkled
when
man
and
beast
and
herb
were
not
at
last
somewhere
on
the
long
crest
having
been
told
that
you
must
bring
luncheon
with
you
and
having
provided
yourself
at
the
railway
station
with
cold
bread
and
fruit
and
eggs
you
had
luncheon
it
was
eaten
near
a
bubbling
spring
with
a
at
which
the
horses
were
drinking
and
eaten
with
the
most
tremendous
appetite
by
now
you
were
convinced
that
the
air
up
here
was
blowing
through
a
champagne
bottle
luncheon
over
and
the
horses
rested
on
went
the
stage
quite
in
the
you
began
to
go
down
the
mountain
somewhat
later
in
a
turn
by
a
buckwheat
field
waving
white
in
the
summer
wind
the
driver
would
point
with
his
whip
right
down
there
there
the
new
springs
be
there
in
an
hour
now
it
might
be
right
down
there
but
still
the
new
springs
was
pretty
high
in
the
world
away
away
above
sea
level
you
always
slept
at
the
new
springs
under
blankets
you
nearly
always
had
a
fire
in
the
evening
even
the
heat
of
the
midday
sun
in
the
dog
days
was
only
a
dry
delightful
warmth
hardly
anywhere
did
the
stars
shine
so
brightly
the
air
was
so
rare
and
fine
the
new
springs
boasted
no
imposing
dwellings
there
was
a
hotel
of
faint
old
red
brick
with
a
pillared
verandah
and
there
were
half
a
dozen
frame
cottages
each
with
a
small
porch
and
growing
over
it
its
individual
vine
honeysuckle
clambered
over
one
and
hops
over
another
and
a
scarlet
bean
over
a
third
and
so
on
there
was
an
sulphur
spring
where
the
bubbles
were
always
rising
and
around
it
was
built
a
rustic
pavilion
also
there
existed
a
yes
there
the
new
springs
said
the
driver
pointing
with
his
whip
but
lord
it
stopped
being
new
a
long
time
ago
there
were
hardly
any
passengers
only
three
in
fact
two
women
and
a
man
all
three
were
young
enough
to
accomplish
with
enjoyment
a
great
deal
of
walking
up
the
long
mountain
they
had
laughed
and
talked
together
though
of
very
nothings
as
became
folk
the
birds
and
the
bees
and
butterflies
the
flowers
the
air
and
the
view
had
been
the
chief
subjects
of
comment
now
back
in
the
stage
for
the
descent
they
held
in
their
hands
flowers
and
ferns
and
branches
covered
with
ripe
huckleberries
which
they
detached
from
the
stems
lifted
to
their
lips
and
ate
the
two
women
were
friends
coming
so
they
now
explained
to
their
from
a
distance
to
this
little
place
the
brother
of
one
it
seemed
was
a
great
fisherman
and
came
often
he
was
not
here
this
year
he
was
travelling
in
palestine
but
he
had
advised
his
sister
who
was
a
little
broken
down
and
wanted
a
quiet
place
to
work
in
to
come
here
she
said
jubilantly
that
if
the
air
was
always
going
to
be
like
this
she
was
glad
she
had
come
it
had
seemed
funny
at
first
to
think
of
coming
south
for
the
summer
though
her
friend
was
and
mind
i
wondering
said
the
with
an
effect
of
gallantry
what
in
the
world
the
work
can
be
the
very
latest
thing
i
suppose
in
or
perhaps
you
do
pastels
elizabeth
eden
looked
at
him
with
her
very
candid
grey
eyes
i
doing
a
book
of
statistics
women
and
children
in
industry
and
i
said
the
other
marie
caton
i
teach
english
to
immigrant
girls
we
are
both
settlement
workers
laydon
prided
himself
on
his
ability
quickly
to
shift
sail
oh
he
said
a
settlement
that
an
idea
that
has
got
down
to
us
yet
we
are
rather
lazy
i
i
was
reading
though
an
excellent
article
upon
settlements
in
one
of
the
current
magazines
only
the
other
day
ladies
especially
seem
to
be
going
in
for
that
kind
of
work
of
course
it
is
when
you
think
of
it
only
an
extension
of
their
historic
function
as
charity
and
woman
almost
synonymous
that
a
magnificent
compliment
or
meant
to
be
said
marie
caton
her
eyes
were
dancing
i
wonder
what
you
say
if
i
said
that
charity
charity
in
your
sense
is
one
of
woman
worst
weaknesses
thank
god
settlements
bad
as
they
are
are
charity
look
at
the
view
marie
said
elizabeth
and
oh
feel
that
wind
is
it
divine
winds
blow
from
all
four
points
at
oncet
up
here
said
the
driver
ai
many
people
at
the
new
springs
this
summer
fish
do
bite
or
everybody
gone
to
the
world
fair
or
something
or
other
more
forty
people
countin
children
what
kind
of
people
are
they
do
the
women
fish
too
no
not
much
it
the
husbands
and
brothers
and
fathers
does
the
fishing
mostly
though
there
josslyn

the
others
just
sit
around
in
i
reckon
and
crochet
them
that
has
children
looks
after
them
and
them
that
has
listens
to
them
that
has
then
it
a
fine
air
for
the
health
fine
air
and
fine
water
a
lot
of
tired
people
come
then
there
others
get
into
the
habit
of
meeting
friends
here
being
on
the
border
as
it
were
it
convenient
for
more
states
than
one
colonel
ashendyne
for
instance
he
comes
because
general
argyle
and
judge
black
and
he
made
a
pact
in
the
war
that
if
they
lived
through
they
spend
a
month
together
every
two
years
until
they
died
they
kept
it
faithful
and
because
judge
black
a
great
fisherman
and
general
argyle
likes
the
juleps
they
make
here
and
colonel
ashendyne
knew
the
place
when
he
was
a
boy
they
pitched
on
the
new
springs
when
they
here
together
they
the
three
git
up
thar
dandy
this
year
the
got
his
daughter
and
granddaughter
with
him
laydon
nodded
looking
animated
and
handsome
i
know
the
ashendynes
indeed
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
the
ashendynes
he
explained
for
the
benefit
of
the
two
foreigners
are
one
of
our
oldest
families
with
connections
everywhere
not
wealthy
we
have
very
little
wealth
you
know
but
old
very
widespread
and
honoured
a
number
of
them
in
the
past
were
really
famous
it
might
be
said
of
the
ashendynes
as
it
was
said
of
an
english
family
the
sons
were
brave
and
all
the
daughters
virtuous
you
seem
said
marie
caton
to
have
a
profound
acquaintance
with
the
best
literature
laydon
disclaimed
it
with
a
modest
shake
of
the
head
oh
only
however
literature
is
my
profession
i
have
a
chair
of
that
is
interesting
said
elizabeth
in
her
friendly
voice
is
it
your
vacation

a
fisherman
too
oh
i
fish
a
little
on
occasion
but
i
am
not
what
you
call
a
great
fisherman
and
i
was
never
at
the
new
springs
before
he
gave
a
embarrassed
laugh
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
one
of
those
persons
who
come
because
another
person
happens
to
be
here
oh
said
marie
caton
i
see
she
began
presently
to
hum
beneath
her
breath
gin
a
body
meet
a
body
comin
through
the
rye
oh
what
a
rough
piece
of
road

the
driver

was
a
fellow
through
here
last
summer

they
was
changing
so
rapid
they
made
you
dizzy
but

that
identical
rut

little
look

that
side
and

the
new
springs
again

sunset

up
the
road

marie
caton
in
a
green
gingham
and
a
shady
hat

he
lifted
his
hat
to
his
and
the
stage
went
on
without
him

nice
man

elizabeth
who
was
inveterate
at
finding
good
not
very
original
but
then
who

said
marie
promptly
now
we
see
the
girl

and
light
like
a
right
mountain
climber
the
stage
met
and
passed
hagar
she
and
the
driver
exchanging
the
stage
lumbered
on
down
the
slope
i
liked
her
looks
said
marie
now
they
meeting

right
i
wo
i
like
such
consideration

are
going
to
get
strong
enough
at
the
new
springs
to
throw
every
statistic
between
canada
and
mexico
back
beside
the
big
rock
at
the
bend
of
the
road
hagar
and
laydon
met
there
is
any
one
to
see
he
exclaimed
and
would
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
she
evaded
his
grasp
putting
out
her
hand
and
a
light
staff
which
she
carried
no
laydon
wait
wait
stepping
backward
to
the
rock
by
the
wayside
she
sat
down
upon
it
behind
her
all
the
waves
of
the
endless
mountains
i
only
got
your
letter
yesterday
it
had
been
delayed
if
i
had
had
it
in
time

should
have

it

laydon
that

of
your
grandfather

new
springs

mine
to

to
as
it
is
his
i
had
just
three
days
before
i
go
to
to
see
about
that
opening
there
the
idea
came
to
me
that
if
i
could
really
see
him
and
talk
to
him
he
might
become
reconciled
and
then
dear
little
girl
i
wanted
to
see
you

could
resist
as
he
spoke
he
moved
toward
her
again

shook
her
head
and
put
out
again
the
hand
with
the
staff
no
that
is
over
i
came
up
here
to
meet
you
because
i
wanted
to
find
out
to
know
to
be
certain
at
once
to
find
out
to
know
to
be
certain
of
what
he
smiled
that
i
am
just
the
same
that
i
love
you
still
to
be
certain
said
hagar
that
i
was
mistaken
i
have
got
my
certainty
i
wish
said
laydon
after
a
pause
that
i
knew
what
you
were
driving
at
there
was
something
in
your
last
month
letter
and
for
the
matter
of
that
in
the
month
before
that
struck
cold
have
i
offended
you
in
any
way
hagar
you
have
not
been
to
blame
said
hagar
i
do
think
either
of
us
was
to
blame
i
think
it
was
an
honest
mistake
i
think
we
took
a
passing
lightning
flash
for
the
sun
in
heaven
laydon
that
evening
in
the
parlour
at
eglantine
and
the
morning
after
when
we
walked
to
the
gate
and
the
road
was
sunny
and
lonely
and
the
bells
were
ringing
oh
then
i
am
sure
i
loved
you
she
drew
her
hand
across
brow
and
eyes
or
if
not
you
i
loved
love
but
after
that
oh
steadily
after
that
it
lessened
you
mean
that
you
are
not
in
love
with
me
as
you
were
i
am
not
in
love
with
you
at
all
i
was
in
love
with
you
or
i
was
in
love
i
am
not
now
she
struck
her
staff
against
the
rock
i
almost
hope
i
never
be
in
love
again
across
from
a
cleared
hillside
steep
and
grassy
came
a
tinkling
of
the
sun
hung
low
in
the
west
and
the
trees
cast
shadows
across
the
road
a
vireo
was
singing
in
a
walnut
tree
a
chipmunk
ran
along
a
bit
of
old
rail
fence
a
zephyr
brought
an
odour
dank
and
rich
from
the
aged
forest
that
hung
above
i
think
said
laydon
that
you
are
treating
me
very
badly
am
i
i
am
sorry
you
must
think
that
i
have
been
wretched
over
all
this
but
it
would
be
treating
you
badly
indeed
if
i
were
such
a
coward
as
to
let
it
go
on
she
looked
at
him
oddly
will
you
be
are
you
much
hurt
i
i
said
laydon
i
do
not
think
you
quite
conceive
what
you
are
saying
nor
what
such
a
cool
pronunciamento
must
mean
to
a
man
hurt
yes
i
am
hurt
my
pride
my
confidence
in
you
my
assurance
that
i
had
your
heart
and
that
you
had
put
your
life
in
my
keeping
the
love
that
i
truly
felt
for
you
you
loved
me
loving
you
oh
said
hagar
i
feel
so
old
so
old
i
loved
you
sincerely
i
imperilled
my
position
for
you
to
a
certain
extent
all
my
prospects
in
life
i
had
delightful
visions
of
the
day
when
we
should
be
finally
together
the
home
you
would
make
the
love
and
protection
i
should
give
you
you
are
honest
said
hagar
and
i
like
honesty
if
i
have
done
you
any
wrong
at
all
if
i
have
made
life
any
harder
for
you
if
i
have
destroyed
any
ideals
if
i
have
done
you
the
least
harm
i
very
heartily
beg
your
pardon
laydon
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
box
and
opened
it
i
had
brought
you
that
hagar
took
it
in
her
hand
and
looked
at
it
it
is
lovely
she
said
a
diamond
and
a
sapphire
and
it
is
going
to
be
wasted
you
keep
it
sooner
or
later
you
surely
need
it
you
could
have
bought
a
prettier
one
she
looked
up
with
a
soft
bright
almost
maternal
face
you
do
know
how
much
happier
i
am
having
faced
it
and
said
it
and
had
it
over
with
and
you
i
do
believe
you
are
so
unhappy
now
are
you
now
are
you
you
have
put
me
in
an
absurd
position
what
am
i
to
say
to
people
nothing
or
what
you
please
i
will
tell
grandfather
myself
and
aunt
serena
i
shall
tell
them
that
you
have
behaved
extremely
well
and
that
it
was
all
my
fault
or
no
i
shall
tell
them
that
we
both
found
out
that
we
had
been
mistaken
for
i
think
that
that
is
the
truth
and
that
we
have
had
an
explanation
and
are
now
and
for
always
just
and
common
friends
and
nothing
more
i
am
going
to
try
i
think
that
now
maybe
i
can
do
it
to
get
grandfather
to
treat
you
properly
there
is
nobody
else
here
whose
business
it
is
or
who
knows
anything
about
it
and
you
have
only
three
days
anyway
there
are
some
pleasant
people
and
you
meet
them
it
is
going
to
be
awkward
indeed
it
is
by
george
said
laydon
if
you
are
the
coolest
of
course
if
this
is
the
way
you
feel
it
may
be
wisest
not
to
link
my
life
with
naturally
a
man
wants
entire
love
admiration
and
confidence
just
so
said
hagar
and
you
find
some
one
to
feel
all
that
and
now
let
walk
to
the
new
springs
chapter
xiii
the
new
springs
laydon
three
days
spun
themselves
out
to
five
with
a
fine
smoothness
colonel
ashendyne
tone
was
balm
itself
to
what
it
might
have
been
miss
serena
was
willing
to
discuss
with
him
in
memoriam
and
the
novels
of
miss
broughton
and
ralph
coltsworth
who
was
also
at
the
new
springs
walked
with
him
over
the
place
laydon
was
keen
enough
to
see
that
hagar
had
appealed
to
her
family
and
that
ashendyne
breeding
had
rallied
to
her
support
he
was
at
once
provoked
and
soothed
now
conscious
only
of
the
injury
to
his
healthy
and
now
of
a
vague
relief
that
young
as
he
still
was
and
with
that
wonderful
future
all
to
make
he
really
was
not
tied
down
his
very
vanity
would
not
agree
but
that
the
woman
with
whom
he
had
thought
himself
in
love
must
be
of
a
superior
type
and
an
undeniable
charm
but
the
same
vanity
conceded
gently
that
to
err
was
mortal
and
that
there
were
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
came
out
of
it
and
that
he
certainly
had
not
been
fatally
smitten
on
the
whole
she
poor
little
thing
had
probably
suffered
the
most
of
the
two
charming
as
she
was
the
glamour
for
him
he
conceded
was
gone
had
come
off
pretty
well
after
when
the
five
days
were
up
he
felt
positive
regret
at
having
to
go
and
his
to
all
the
ashendynes
was
cordial
he
had
already
written
to
legrand
and
of
course
to
his
mother
he
went
the
stage
took
him
up
the
mountain
for
all
i
could
see
and
i
watched
pretty
closely
there
anything
come
of
it
remarked
marie
caton
on
the
whole
i
am
rather
glad
now
you
ca
hear
the
rumble
of
the
stage
any
longer
he
gone
out
of
the
betsy
stop
writing
and
look
at
the
robin
and
the
chipmunk
they
had
the
tiniest
cottage
to
themselves
elizabeth
brother
being
an
here
and
his
letter
to
the
proprietor
procuring
them
great
consideration
there
were
but
two
rooms
in
the
cottage
roof
and
porch
it
was
sunk
in
and
in
front
sprang
a
vast
walnut
tree
and
beyond
the
walnut
a
stream
purled
between
mint
over
a
slaty
bed
from
the
porch
you
looked
southward
over
mountains
and
mountains
and
every
evening
antares
looked
redly
back
at
you
now
it
was
morning
and
wrens
and
robins
and
all
were
singing
elizabeth
looked
up
from
the
table
where
she
was
working
if
i
watch
chipmunks
all
morning
i
never
get
these
textile
figures
mrs
josslyn
said
at
breakfast
that
it
was
a
good
day
for
fishing
and
that
she
might
wander
by
she
coming
now
i
see
her
in
the
distance
i
like
molly
josslyn
so
do
we
have
been
here
a
week
and
yet
we
talk
as
though
we
had
known
these
people
always
well
the
fact
that
quite
a
number
knew
your
brother
made
for
there
being
no
ice
to
break
and
it
would
be
so
absurd
not
to
know
one
another
at
the
new
springs
as
absurd
as
if
a
shipload
of
people
cast
on
a
desert
island
here
she
is
come
in
mrs
josslyn
thank
you
i
do
want
a
chair
said
molly
josslyn
you
do
mind
if
i
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
and
dangle
my
feet
do
you
nor
if
i
take
off
my
hat
and
roll
up
my
sleeves
so
that
i
can
feel
the
air
on
my
arms
not
a
bit
take
the
hairpins
out
of
your
hair
and
let
it
fly
i
wish
that
i
could
cut
it
off
said
molly
viciously
i
will
some
day
pretty
nearly
a
whole
of
an
hour
out
of
every
gone
in
brushing
and
combing
and
doing
up
hair
you
have
to
do
it
in
the
morning
and
the
middle
of
the
day
and
the
evening
a
twentieth
part
of
your
whole
waking
existence
oh
me
what
a
sigh
i
been
in
land
over
on
the
big
porch
heard
everybody
in
a
petticoat
who
was
there
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
of
course
i
knew
they
were
eager
to
get
at
me
and
so
i
was
obliging
and
came
away
marie
caton
laughed
miss
eden
here
is
an
optimist
of
the
first
water
if
you
ask
her
she
tell
you
that
women
are
growing
beyond
that
sort
of
thing
that
they
do
sting
one
another
half
as
much
as
they
used
to
no
i
do
think
they
do
said
josslyn
i
think
that
getting
apparent
nowadays
speaking
for
myself
fresh
air
and
out
of
doors
and
swinging
off
by
one
self
seem
to
make
a
body
more
or
less
charitable
but
some
of
us
have
got
the
habit
yet
gnat
or
wasp
or
hornet
or
snake
on
they
go
she
laughed
over
on
the
porch
it
was
anything
but
a
little
cloud
of
gnats
they
were
really
stinging
just
getting
between
your
eyes
and
the
blue
sky
but
it
is
growing
better
it
is
it
is
said
elizabeth
i
give
up
that
belief
for
anything
no
do
said
molly
josslyn
i
like
women
and
like
to
think
well
of
them
a
strong
rosy
blonde
she
stood
up
and
stretched
her
arms
above
her
head
i
wish
there
were
a
pool
somewhere
deep
enough
to
swim
in
i
like
to
cross
the
hellespont
this
morning
swim
it
and
swim
christopher
is
coming
christopher
my
husband
christopher
josslyn
they
do
said
josslyn
make
them
any
nicer
than
christopher
christopher
was
my
born
mate
and
went
away
with
a
beamy
look
over
the
grass
marie
spoke
thoughtfully
yesterday
i
heard
one
of
the
gnats
singing
it
sang
rather
handsome
but
do
you
find
her
dreadfully
unfeminine
oh
said
elizabeth
and
went
on
adding
figures
marie
caton
took
a
book
from
the
generous
number
ranged
around
a
jar
of
susans
on
the
rustic
table
in
the
middle
of
the
porch
but
the
chipmunks
and
the
robins
get
so
in
the
way
she
presently
dreamily
murmured
and
then
you
had
just
as
well
put
up
your
work
here
judge
black
and
general
argyle
judge
black
was
rather
lean
than
stout
rather
short
than
tall
with
a
countenance
below
grizzled
hair
with
a
bald
spot
at
the
top
like
a
tonsure
general
argyle
was
a
much
larger
and
taller
man
with
a
head
framed
about
with
shaggy
white
hair
his
countenance
was
rubicund
his
voice
mellow
he
was
in
some
respects
very
old
and
in
others
quite
young
usually
at
the
new
springs
colonel
ashendyne
marched
in
company
but
this
morning
ashendyne
got
some
family
conference
or
other
on
hand
a
day
off
for
fishing
and
nobody
seems
to
have
a
mind
for
whist
or
poker
and
the
papers
have
come
argyle
and
i
are
floating
around
like
two
lost
corks
or
the
babes
in
the
wood
so
i
said
said
general
argyle
richly
let
stroll
over
there
and
say
to
tom
eden
sister
and
her
attractive
no
no
no
chairs
we
sit
here
on
the
steps
as
soon
as
ashendyne
appears
we
going
after
young
coltsworth
and
have
a
turn
in
the
must
exercise
that
what
i
always
telling
black
here
as
if
i
did
exercise
said
judge
black
more
in
a
day
than
he
does
in
a
what
a
pretty
little
porch
you
got
books
flowers
needlework
the
general
surveyed
it
too
it
pretty
woman
touch
touch
that
is
needlework
in
the
basket
said
marie
demurely
apples
will
you
have
one
no
thanks
mistress
eve
or
yes
on
second
thoughts
i
will
what
are
you
reading
doll
house
ibsen
yes
i
do
not
know
said
the
judge
what
young
ladies
are
coming
to
i
have
never
had
time
nor
i
may
say
inclination
to
read
ibsen
myself
but
of
course
i
know
the
kind
of
thing
he
responsible
for
and
frankly
i
should
not
permit
my
daughter
to
read
that
book
oh
said
marie
i
do
think
myself
it
is
a
book
for
a
child
she
not
a
child
she
i
should
dissuade
my
wife
too
from
reading
it
then
your
wife
answered
marie
would
miss
an
illuminating
piece
of
literature
elizabeth
came
in
with
her
serene
voice
do
you
think
judge
black
that
we
all
acquire
a
habit
of
judging
a
writer
whom
we
have
yet
had
time
to
study
for
ourselves
too
much
in
terms
of
some
review
or
other
or
of
the
mere
unthinking
current
talk
i
think
we
all
do
it
i
believe
when
you
read
ibsen
you
will
feel
differently
about
him
not
i
said
the
judge
i
have
seen
extracts
enough
i
tell
you
miss
eden
the
age
is
reading
too
much
of
such
decadent
stuff
oh
and
it
is
read
amazingly
by
women
i
would
rather
see
my
wife
or
daughter
with
the
old
dramatists
at
their
worst
in
their
hands
than
with
stuff
like
that
overturning
all
our
concepts
criticizing
supremacies
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
caton
but
if
you
knew
how
women
nowadays
amaze
me
stop
hectoring
black
said
the
general
mellowly
she
not
in
the
dock
just
so
that
women
stay
women
they
can
fill
their
heads
with
what
stuff
they
will
exactly
said
judge
black
do
you
see
them
staying
women
women
of
the
past
said
elizabeth
that
is
woman
the
women
of
the
past
there
is
any
other
the
eternal
feminine
i
think
you
are
limiting
the
eternal
and
denying
the
universe
power
to
evolve
said
elizabeth
why
not
eternally
the
man
of
the
past
why
not
is
any
other
why
not
eternal
masculine
why
do
you
change
and
grow
from
age
to
age
i
not
so
sure
that
they
do
said
marie
yes
they
do
they
grow
and
become
freer
always
though
i
think
said
elizabeth
painfully
that
they
lag
in
the
way
they
look
at
well
if
you
grow
being
one
half
do
you
suppose
that
we
are
not
going
to
grow
being
the
other
half
and
if
you
think
that
the
principle
of
growth
is
not
in
us
still
i
should
worry
if
we
ca
grow
we
wo
grow
and
you
need
fash
yourselves
on
the
other
hand
if
we
can
we
will
and
that
is
all
there
is
about
it
and
it
would
do
you
the
least
harm
to
read
ibsen
nor
to
get
another
definition
of
she
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
do
you
see
that
strip
of
blanched
grass
there
or
rather
it
was
blanched
yesterday
when
that
board
over
there
was
lying
upon
it
and
had
lain
i
do
know
how
long
blanched
and
bent
and
sicklied
over
now
look
it
is
getting
colour
and
standing
straight
only
beginning
but
it
is
beginning
beginning
to
be
on
terms
with
the
sun
well
that
grass
is
woman
the
heavy
board
is
being
lifted
and
that
the
change
and
all
the
change
and
you
find
it
she
ceased
speaking
judge
black
colour
too
had
heightened
my
dear
miss
eden
how
did
all
this
begin
i
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
deny
to
woman
a
proper
freedom
i
only
ask
that
it
sha
go
beyond
a
certain
point
that
it
sha
threaten
the
unsettling
of
a
certain
divine
i
doubt
if
a
divine
is
ever
unsettled
judge
black
said
elizabeth
but
there
but
there
she
smiled
and
she
had
a
very
sweet
sunny
smile
i
did
in
the
least
mean
to
quarrel
tom
will
have
told
you
that
i
sometimes
use
my
tongue
and
that
the
ancient
woman
still
is
it
you
see
i
care
for
women
being
one
a
good
deal
let
us
said
marie
caton
talk
about
fishing
general
argyle
chuckled
black
does
think
you
know
anything
about
fishing
he
has
to
acknowledge
that
josslyn
does
but
then
he
thinks
that
she
a
charming
i
like
to
hear
you
give
it
to
black
pay
him
back
he
always
giving
it
to
me
that
right
said
black
pitch
into
me
cover
me
with
obloquy
poor
homeless
friendless
sailor
with
the
pole
star
mysteriously
shifted
from
its
place
the
homeless
friendless
sailor
stayed
a
long
time
even
with
the
pole
star
shifted
remarked
marie
forty
minutes
later
i
certainly
did
mean
to
be
rude
murmured
elizabeth
her
eyes
upon
the
disappearing
guests
now
well
on
their
way
to
the
they
mean
you
never
to
resent
a
thing
which
they
would
at
once
recognize
for
an
impertinence
if
one
of
themselves
said
it
to
another
oh
i
should
dub
you
rude
said
the
other
and
if
he
found
you
uncomfortable
for
a
minute
you
made
up
for
it
afterwards
you
were
charming
enough
just
as
charming
as
if
the
pole
star
had
never
shifted
he
went
off
still
in
mind
the
eastern
king
ah
said
elizabeth
that
is
where
all
of
us
are
weak
we
say
the
truth
and
then
we
bring
in
and
sandpaper
it
away
again
going
to
take
another
generation
marie
another
said
marie
a
dozen
more
like
now
i
suppose
i
can
read
doll
house
in
no
by
all
that
fated
in
this
place
here
comes
another
guest
this
was
ralph
coltsworth
but
he
made
no
long
tarrying
he
was
as
transient
as
a
butterfly
have
you
ladies
seen
hagar
ashendyne
i
want
her
to
go
to
walk
with
me
and
i
ca
find
her
anywhere
no
we
have
said
marie
judge
black
and
general
argyle
are
looking
for
you
to
play
tenpins
ralph
smiled
back
at
her
let
them
look
it
will
do
the
old
codgers
good
do
you
like
this
place
yes
very
much
do
you
oh
i
like
it
said
ralph
it
a
good
enough
lotus
land
but
there
a
lack
somehow
of
wild
exciting
adventure
i
been
trying
to
read
on
the
hotel
porch
what
do
you
think
they
talking
about
over
there
fringed
doilies
what
do
you
like
to
do
and
to
talk
about
live
things
he
laughed
tossed
an
apple
into
the
air
and
caught
it
again
i
want
first
to
make
fifty
millions
and
then
i
want
to
spend
fifty
millions
what
an
admirable
american
you
are
am
i
not
and
i
vary
it
with
just
wanting
to
be
a
cowboy
with
a
on
a
western
plain
he
tossed
the
apple
into
the
air
again
and
watching
it
missed
the
glimpse
of
hagar
which
the
other
two
received
she
appeared
around
the
corner
of
a
neighbouring
cottage
her
face
directed
toward
the
porch
saw
coltsworth
wheeled
and
withdrew
he
caught
the
apple
and
after
gazing
meditatively
for
a
moment
in
the
direction
of
the
sighed
and
said
that
he
supposed
after
all
he
might
as
well
go
help
the
general
demolish
the
army
of
the
potomac
that
what
he
calls
the
pins
when
they
set
up
he
takes
the
biggest
bowl
and
sends
it
thundering
i
believe
he
thinks
for
the
moment
it
is
a
ball
from
one
of
his
old
he
sees
fire
and
smells
smoke
sometimes
he
demolishes
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
sometimes
he
does
but
he
never
gets
discouraged
the
next
cannon
ball
will
surely
do
the
work
when
he
was
gone
and
had
been
gone
twenty
minutes
or
more
hagar
reappeared
she
came
swiftly
across
the
grass
mounted
the
porch
steps
and
stood
with
a
little
deprecating
shake
of
her
head
for
the
offered
chair
by
elizabeth
i
am
not
going
to
stay
thank
you
miss
eden
somebody
told
me
last
night
that
you
had
written
and
published
books
only
text
and
reference
books
compilations
said
elizabeth
i
only
do
that
kind
of
unoriginal
work
yes
but
a
book
is
a
book
said
hagar
what
i
wondered
was
if
you
would
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
some
things
no
one
in
all
my
connection
writes
i
do
know
any
one
to
go
to
i
only
want
to
know
plain
things
a
b
c
of
how
to
manage
about
a
manuscript
you
mean
yes
i
do
know
anything
i
read
all
kinds
of
useless
things
and
so
little
useful
for
instance
said
hagar
is
it
wrong
to
write
on
both
sides
of
the
paper
chapter
xiv
new
york
in
august
the
ashendynes
being
back
at
gilead
balm
the
young
people
home
magazine
published
hagar
fairy
story
gilead
balm
was
impressed
but
not
greatly
impressed
it
had
the
aristocratic
tradition
as
to
writers
no
ashendyne
had
ever
needed
to
be
one
there
had
been
editor
ashendynes
in
the
old
fiery
early
and
times
but
editorship
came
out
naturally
from
the
political
stream
and
the
political
with
law
planting
and
soldiery
had
been
the
ashendyne
stream
the
ashendyne
mind
harked
back
to
early
georgian
even
to
stuart
times
when
you
said
writer
it
saw
something
grub
streetish
in
addition
hagar
was
of
course
only
a
child
story
the
two
hundred
dollars
shrank
in
impressiveness
from
being
known
of
after
and
not
before
medway
ashendyne
letter
but
to
the
eyes
of
her
grandmother
and
her
aunt
serena
the
two
hundred
dollars
was
the
impressive
the
only
really
impressive
thing
her
grandmother
advised
that
it
be
put
in
bank
miss
serena
said
that
when
she
was
age
she
had
had
a
watch
and
chain
for
more
than
two
years
what
would
you
like
to
do
with
it
gipsy
asked
captain
bob
the
colour
came
into
hagar
cheeks
with
one
half
i
want
to
get
my
two
winter
dresses
and
my
coat
and
hat
and
with
the
other
half
i
want
to
get
books
books
exclaimed
the
ashendynes
the
colonel
was
not
present
why
are
there
books
enough
here
they
are
not
the
kind
of
books
i
need
nonsense
said
old
miss
get
your
winter
clothes
if
you
wish
though
i
am
sure
that
medway
means
now
to
send
the
colonel
money
for
you
but
save
the
rest
it
will
come
in
useful
some
day
some
day
child
you
be
thinking
about
your
marriage
clothes
luna
and
i
came
over
the
hill
just
now
with
ralph
coltsworth
remarked
captain
bob
cheerfully
apropos
of
nothing
he
says
studying
hard
means
to
catch
up
at
the
university
and
be
a
credit
to
the
family
miss
serena
was
talented
in
taking
offence
at
small
things
she
had
evolved
the
idea
and
she
thought
it
should
have
received
more
consideration
in
addition
she
had
the
kind
of
memory
that
always
holds
the
wrong
things
books
i
suppose
you
mean
a
kind
of
books
that
we
certainly
do
have
many
of
here
french
novels
and
darwin
and
the
kind
of
books
those
two
northern
women
were
reading
this
summer
even
when
you
were
a
child
do
you
remember
mother
you
had
a
perfect
talent
for
getting
your
hands
on
debasing
literature
i
supposed
you
had
outgrown
it
i
sure
legrand
never
encouraged
it
a
hundred
dollars
worth
of
books
and
i
suppose
you
are
to
choose
them
well
if
i
were
father
i
look
over
the
list
first
aunt
serena
said
hagar
with
a
spanish
gravity
and
courtesy
there
are
times
when
i
understand
the
most
violent
crimes
yes
i
know
you
do
know
what
i
mean
that
was
in
august
september
passed
and
part
of
october
and
then
late
in
that
month
hagar
went
to
new
york
medway
ashendyne
and
his
wife
were
travelling
in
the
east
next
year
or
the
year
after
they
might
medway
wrote
be
in
america
in
the
meantime
hagar
must
have
advantages
he
had
not
the
least
idea
he
wrote
his
father
what
kind
of
a
person
she
was
her
letters
were
formal
toneless
and
colourless
to
a
degree
he
hoped
she
had
not
inherited
but
whatever
she
had
inherited
she
was
of
course
his
daughter
and
he
must
take
care
of
her
being
now
in
a
position
properly
to
do
so
his
wife
suggested
for
the
moment
a
winter
in
new
york
properly
chaperoned
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
there
followed
a
memorandum
of
a
handsome
sum
placed
in
bank
to
the
credit
he
could
he
knew
leave
it
to
his
father
and
mother
to
see
that
she
properly
chaperoned
his
wife
had
thought
of
making
certain
suggestions
but
upon
talking
it
over
together
they
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
at
the
moment
at
least
it
would
be
wisest
not
to
interfere
with
the
gilead
balm
order
and
way
of
life
it
was
admirably
suited
he
judged
for
a
young
girl
bringing
up
much
better
than
the
modern
american
way
of
doing
things
only
in
france
or
the
orient
was
the
really
preserved
the
colonel
wrote
to
legrand
legrand
returned
one
of
her
long
fluent
letters
first
of
all
congratulations
that
hagar
had
come
to
her
senses
about
laydon
then
now
as
to
new
york
sylvie
was
going
to
new
york
too
going
to
have
singing
lessons
for
she
had
a
very
sweet
voice
and
every
one
agreed
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
not
to
give
it
the
best
training
the
problem
of
how
to
manage
for
sylvie
had
received
the
following
solution
and
legrand
proffered
it
as
a
possible
way
to
manage
for
hagar
also
there
was
powhatan
maine
family
in
new
york
powhatan
himself
and
bessie
and
their
widowed
daughter
bolt
with
her
two
children
they
lived
well
in
our
quiet
homelike
southern
fashion
of
course
powhatan
was
a
solid
lawyer
in
a
solid
firm
sylvie
had
paid
them
a
visit
once
before
but
of
course
this
year
it
was
a
question
of
her
being
in
new
york
for
months
and
months
now
ordinarily
the
maines
would
not
have
heard
of
such
a
thing
but
this
disastrous
year
with
everybody
failing
powhatan
had
lost
heavily
in
stocks
and
apparently
they
were
having
to
economize
at
any
rate
bessie
was
willing
just
for
this
year
to
take
sylvie
under
her
wing
and
to
let
her
pay
for
her
room
and
board
the
maines
house
was
a
good
big
one
and
legrand
had
very
little
doubt
that
just
as
a
family
favour
bessie
would
be
willing
to
receive
hagar
on
similar
terms
bessie
would
certainly
stipulate
that
the
arrangement
should
be
a
quiet
one
just
between
themselves
and
that
hagar
no
less
than
sylvie
should
be
regarded
merely
as
a
young
friend
and
connection
visiting
her
that
winter
this
understood
bessie
would
look
after
the
two
as
if
they
were
her
own
it
was
fortunate
that
neither
sylvie
nor
hagar
was
out
for
the
maines
were
in
mourning
but
powhatan
and
bessie
knew
a
great
many
people
and
the
two
girls
would
probably
see
company
enough
you
remember
bessie
do
you
itself
nothing
pleases
her
so
much
as
having
people
happy
about
her
then
too
there
would
be
rachel
bolt
she
could
take
hagar
to
the
theatre
and
to
concerts
and
the
picture
galleries
and
where
not
the
maines
are
all
members
of
timothy
the
bishop
nephew
church
you
know
in
fine
legrand
advised
that
the
ashendynes
write
at
once
to
maine
it
was
done
and
hagar
winter
soon
arranged
for
new
york
she
had
dreamed
of
great
cities
but
she
had
never
seen
one
the
night
on
the
her
first
night
on
any
she
stayed
awake
and
watched
through
the
window
the
flying
clouds
and
the
moon
and
stars
between
and
underneath
the
fugitive
landscape
there
was
a
sense
of
exaltation
of
rushing
on
with
the
rushing
world
now
and
again
as
the
train
creaked
and
swung
and
once
as
another
roared
past
there
came
moments
of
fascinated
terror
rushing
train
and
rushing
world
all
galloping
wildly
through
the
night
and
in
front
surely
some
bottomless
precipice
she
and
sylvie
had
a
section
and
though
hagar
had
offered
to
take
the
upper
berth
it
had
ended
in
their
having
it
put
back
and
sleeping
together
now
hagar
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
at
the
sleeping
sylvie
there
was
a
dim
blended
light
coming
from
the
lamp
above
and
the
moonlight
night
without
sylvie
lay
fast
asleep
her
hair
in
glossy
braids
her
pretty
face
sunk
in
the
pillow
her
breast
quietly
rising
and
falling
hagar
had
an
intense
impersonal
abstract
passion
for
beauty
wherever
and
in
whatever
form
it
resided
now
limbs
beneath
her
her
arms
nursing
each
other
she
sat
and
regarded
the
sleeping
sylvie
with
a
pure
detached
admiration
the
train
roared
into
a
station
she
drew
the
window
curtain
until
it
roared
out
again
then
bared
the
window
and
sat
and
watched
the
flying
dark
woods
and
the
silver
surface
of
some
wide
water
new
york
new
york
new
york
sylvie
was
a
travelled
lady
sylvie
had
been
to
new
york
before
she
had
been
to
florida
and
new
orleans
and
niagara
and
saratoga
she
could
play
sweetly
not
arrogantly
sylvie
was
not
arrogant
except
perhaps
a
little
when
it
came
to
good
looks
the
part
of
guide
and
mentor
to
hagar
in
the
jersey
city
station
she
kept
a
reassuring
touch
upon
hagar
arm
down
the
long
platform
to
the
gate
the
new
york
ferry
has
a
sign
over
it
even
if
they
do
meet
us
i
know
how
to
manage
oh
there
cousin
powhatan
it
was
a
morning
going
over
with
a
mist
that
was
almost
a
fog
hanging
upon
the
water
and
making
unearthly
and
like
a
mirage
the
strange
before
them
there
were
not
so
many
huge
tall
buildings
as
there
would
be
in
after
years
but
they
were
beginning
the
mist
drifted
opening
and
closing
and
to
the
mist
was
added
the
fairy
garlands
and
pennants
of
white
steam
out
of
the
luminous
haze
grew
white
ferryboats
and
low
barges
and
here
passed
an
opalescent
shape
like
a
vast
moth
wing
a
sailboat
said
hagar
under
her
breath
the
air
was
chill
and
clinging
sylvie
and
captain
powhatan
maine
preferred
to
sit
and
talk
within
the
cabin
but
hagar
remained
outside
she
stood
with
her
hands
lightly
touching
the
rail
her
eyes
wide
another
sailboat
slipped
past
she
turned
and
looked
along
the
widening
water
oceanward
and
in
a
rift
of
the
grey
pearl
clouds
she
seemed
to
see
at
a
great
distance
a
looming
woman
shape
a
salt
odour
filled
her
nostrils
oh
the
sea
i
smell
the
sea
the
ferryboat
glided
into
its
slip
the
bell
rang
the
chains
rattled
out
resonantly
from
the
lower
deck
passed
the
great
dray
horses
and
heavy
wagons
the
passengers
disembarked
a
crowd
hurried
in
column
toward
the
elevated
hagar
found
herself
mounting
long
flights
of
steps
passing
through
a
gateway
entering
a
train
which
at
once
with
a
shriek
began
to
run
upon
a
level
with
windows
she
saw
dingy
factory
and
tenement
buildings
close
close
to
her
face
and
staring
windows
with
squalid
or
horribly
tawdry
rooms
beyond
on
the
spindling
starved
plants
in
ancient
battered
tin
cans
children
faces
women
leaning
out
children
children
children
we
have
to
go
quite
far
uptown
said
captain
maine
well
and
what
do
you
girls
want
to
see
first
he
was
a
short
stout
gallant
gentleman
with
a
fierce
grey
mustache
sylvie
talked
for
both
hagar
nodded
her
head
or
commanded
a
smile
when
manners
seemed
to
indicate
it
but
her
mind
was
dealing
with
a
nightmare
was
this
was
this
new
york
once
she
turned
her
head
toward
their
escort
but
something
told
her
that
if
indeed
she
asked
the
absurd
question
he
would
say
why
yes
do
you
like
it
where
were
the
domes
and
colonnades
where
the
cleanness
and
fairness
where
the
order
and
beauty
where
was
the
noble
great
city
where
were
the
happy
people
she
tried
to
tell
herself
first
that
all
these
were
there
that
this
was
but
a
chance
ugly
street
the
train
was
going
through
but
they
went
through
it
for
miles
and
she
caught
glimpses
of
so
many
other
streets
that
seemed
no
better
and
then
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
after
all
she
must
have
known
it
would
be
something
like
this
she
had
seen
before
on
a
small
scale
in
a
small
city
decrepit
buildings
and
decrepit
people
of
all
ages
poverty
dirt
and
disease
one
city
would
be
like
another
only
larger
she
must
have
known
but
knowing
did
not
seem
to
have
helped
or
perhaps
she
had
never
really
seen
nor
thought
it
out
she
was
tired
and
overstrained
a
horror
came
upon
her
she
looked
through
a
window
into
a
room
hung
with
a
ghastly
green
torn
and
soiled
paper
men
and
women
were
working
in
it
bent
over
a
long
table
working
haggardly
and
fast
the
shirts
of
the
men
the
bodices
of
the
women
open
at
the
throat
another
window
a
wretched
blowsy
woman
and
a
young
man
with
a
bloated
unwholesome
face
another
and
an
old
old
woman
with
a
crying
child
whom
she
struck
then
mere
blank
windows
or
windows
with
starveling
geraniums
in
broken
pots
and
beneath
and
around
and
everywhere
voices
and
heavy
wheels
and
the
train
rushing
on
upon
its
trestle
high
in
the
air
something
black
and
cold
and
hopeless
rolled
over
hagar
soul
it
was
as
though
the
train
were
droning
droning
a
melancholy
text
hagar
what
is
the
matter
you
looked
as
though
you
were
going
to
faint
but
hagar
was
going
to
faint
she
pulled
herself
together
no
no
it
is
anything
i
was
tired
i
suppose
must
faint
in
new
york
said
captain
maine
genially
you
get
run
over
if
you
do
on
went
the
elevated
and
the
walls
of
windows
grew
vaguely
better
or
the
shock
of
surprise
was
over
or
the
armoured
being
within
shouldered
away
a
hampering
unhappiness
york
new
york
new
york
hope
and
vision
sprang
afresh
the
windows
and
the
houses
in
which
they
were
set
decidedly
bettered
there
were
distant
glimpses
of
fine
buildings
spires
of
churches
trees
that
must
be
in
a
park
the
sun
which
had
been
all
morning
hidden
by
clouds
came
suddenly
forth
and
flooded
the
world
with
october
gold
the
gulf
between
what
she
had
dreamed
and
what
she
saw
perceptibly
narrowed
though
it
was
still
there
and
though
it
still
ached
here
we
are
said
captain
maine
and
folded
his
newspaper
out
of
the
train
upon
a
platform
then
more
stairs
this
time
running
downward
then
a
block
or
two
of
walking
in
the
crisp
air
then
a
very
different
street
from
those
the
train
had
rushed
through
and
very
different
houses
here
we
are
said
their
host
again
and
they
mounted
a
brownstone
stoop
a
coloured
maid
opened
the
door
they
passed
into
a
narrow
reception
hall
with
the
ancestral
tall
clock
standing
by
the
stair
and
on
the
opposing
walls
engravings
of
southern
generals
thence
through
folding
doors
into
a
cool
deep
parlour
and
the
embrace
of
maine
maine
was
large
and
sleepy
and
quiet
and
dark
with
a
nebulous
personality
everybody
who
knew
her
said
that
she
was
extremely
while
a
few
added
that
she
was
too
indolent
to
be
irascible
and
a
fair
number
called
it
native
kindliness
and
adduced
a
range
of
respectable
incidents
no
one
ever
hinted
at
intellectuality
and
she
certainly
did
not
shine
in
conversation
she
was
not
apparently
socially
ambitious
and
nobody
could
be
said
to
take
less
trouble
and
yet
a
number
of
people
chiefly
southerners
dwelling
in
new
york
the
more
decorative
and
prosperous
of
timothy
congregation
and
powhatan
maine
legal
associates
and
acquaintances
exhibited
a
certain
partiality
for
the
maine
house
powhatan
told
good
war
stories
and
darky
stories
almost
always
there
appeared
something
good
to
eat
with
a
southern
name
and
flavour
and
maine
was
as
unobtrusive
and
comfortable
to
get
on
with
as
the
ether
there
was
nothing
riotous
nor
especially
buoyant
in
the
house
it
was
rather
dim
and
dull
and
staid
but
people
who
had
begun
to
visit
the
maines
twenty
years
before
visited
still
perhaps
most
of
them
were
dim
and
dull
and
staid
themselves
others
perhaps
liked
the
occasional
salt
of
an
environment
which
was
not
habitually
theirs
the
house
itself
was
deep
and
for
a
new
york
dwelling
wide
cool
and
dark
with
a
gleam
of
white
marble
and
antiquated
crystal
chandeliers
with
some
ancient
virginia
furniture
and
some
ebony
and
walnut
abominations
of
the
everything
was
a
little
worn
tending
toward
shabbiness
but
a
shabbiness
not
extreme
as
yet
only
comfortable
though
with
a
glance
toward
a
more
helpless
old
age
there
were
a
fair
number
of
books
some
portraits
and
good
engravings
there
were
four
coloured
servants
beside
the
nurse
for
bolt
children
the
children
charley
and
betty
were
pudgy
quaint
elves
of
three
and
five
charley
the
younger
had
been
blind
from
birth
that
evening
rachel
bolt
came
before
bedtime
into
hagar
room
may
i
sit
and
talk
a
little
while
sylvie
and
mother
and
father
and
dick
dabney
who
came
in
a
little
while
ago
are
playing
duplicate
whist
of
course
you
may
it
such
a
pleasant
room
you
given
me
rachel
turned
in
her
chair
and
regarded
it
from
wall
to
wall
somewhat
cynically
well
i
suppose
at
the
first
blush
it
may
seem
so
it
is
however
rather
shabby
we
meant
to
do
it
over
again
this
year
but
times
are
so
tremendously
hard
that
we
gave
it
up
with
a
lot
of
other
what
i
really
came
in
for
was
to
ask
what
kind
of
things
and
places
and
people
you
like
to
see
this
winter
it
agreed
with
your
grandfather
that
i
to
take
you
around
it
is
good
of
you
to
be
willing
to
do
it
oh
i
to
be
paid
for
doing
it
i
be
spinning
my
spring
outfit
and
betty
and
charley
while
we
gallivant
but
i
do
not
mean
she
laughed
that
it
is
going
to
be
hard
or
disagreeable
work
unless
she
ended
coolly
you
want
to
go
to
places
where
i
do
want
to
go
to
those
places
said
hagar
seriously
i
will
go
alone
then
said
rachel
we
will
get
along
very
well
what
do
you
want
to
do
anyhow
i
want
to
feel
around
for
a
while
and
i
like
to
be
shown
how
to
go
and
how
to
manage
just
at
first
but
after
that
i
hope
you
wo
mind
if
i
just
wander
about
by
myself
she
lifted
her
long
arms
above
her
head
in
a
gesture
harassed
and
restless
i
think
there
are
people
to
whom
solitude
means
as
much
as
food
or
sleep
do
you
want
me
to
get
up
and
say
asked
rachel
promptly
hagar
gave
a
warm
little
laugh
not
yet
awhile
i
not
that
greedy
and
sleepy
i
strive
to
be
temperate
what
i
want
to
see
first
are
pictures
i
have
never
seen
any
barring
those
at
home
and
at
eglantine
well
we
can
go
to
the
metropolitan
i
should
like
that
then
i
want
to
hear
music
i
have
never
heard
any
to
count
there
be
concerts
and
the
opera
later
the
opera
is
of
course
very
expensive
but
i
understand
that
your
father
wants
you
to
do
pretty
well
what
you
wish
if
you
do
mind
being
high
up
we
can
do
a
good
deal
of
it
reasonably
then
let
us
go
high
up
at
the
moment
there
are
even
concerts
we
might
find
an
organ
recital
and
on
sundays
there
is
music
in
the
park
day
after
is
sunday
i
go
and
hear
that
then
i
want
to
go
to
the
theatre
most
of
that
will
come
later
too
are
you
fond
of
the
theatre
i
do
know
that
is
why
i
want
to
go
to
find
out
i
have
never
seen
but
three
plays
what
an
awfully
lucky
person
what
were
they
one
i
was
a
little
girl
and
i
went
to
richmond
for
two
days
was
stuart
janauschek
played
it
the
next
was
in
the
small
town
near
where
i
live
it
was
rather
terribly
done
i
believe
and
it
kept
me
awake
for
a
week
afterward
i
was
fifteen
it
was
corsican
brothers
then
said
hagar
last
winter
i
saw
and
they
did
seem
like
plays
they
seemed
like
life
sometimes
terrible
and
sometimes
beautiful
i
want
to
go
to
find
out
if
it
is
always
so
it
is
said
rachel
you
are
inexperienced
there
is
a
natural
history
museum
here
is
there
yes
a
large
one
i
want
to
go
there
i
want
to
see
malachite
and
chrysoprase
and
jade
and
the
large
blue
butterflies
and
the
apes
up
to
man
and
the
models
of
the
pterodactyl
and
dinosaur
and
a
hundred
other
things
until
now
said
rachel
i
have
thought
that
charley
and
betty
had
the
largest
possible
appetites
what
else
am
i
tiring
you
not
a
bit
besides
it
is
business
i
came
in
here
to
get
a
it
rather
curious
that
you
should
have
such
a
passion
for
minerals
and
species
and
prehistoric
things
is
it
well
i
have
it
said
hagar
she
put
her
arms
again
behind
and
above
her
head
if
you
want
to
know
all
you
must
live
all
though
in
honour
preferring
one
to
the
other
beside
her
on
the
little
table
by
the
hearth
was
a
paper
and
pencil
suddenly
she
unlocked
her
hands
bent
over
and
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
from
under
the
book
with
which
she
had
covered
it
on
rachel
entrance
i
was
trying
to
write
something
when
you
came
in
it
is
rough
and
crude
just
the
skeleton
but
it
something
like
what
i
mean
and
what
i
want
she
held
it
out
then
with
a
deprecating
gesture
and
a
shy
flush
if
it
does
bore
you
rachel
took
it
and
read
god
that
am
i
i
that
am
god
mass
and
motion
and
psyche
inextricably
wound
we
began
not
we
end
not
and
a
sole
purpose
have
we
intimately
to
know
and
exalted
to
taste
in
wisdom
and
beauty
perpetually
heightening
the
absolute
infinite
one
substance
who
is
in
joy
to
name
in
wisdom
to
know
all
flames
and
all
fruits
from
that
hearth
and
that
tree
to
name
infinite
modes
eternally
to
name
to
name
as
we
grow
and
grow
as
we
name
and
stars
shall
arise
beyond
stars
that
we
see
and
shall
come
to
me
in
god
god
in
me
rachel
put
it
down
i
think
that
out
a
little
we
never
had
any
one
in
the
house
just
like
you
i
thought
said
hagar
that
sunday
morning
i
would
go
to
the
catholic
cathedral
if
you
tell
me
the
way
i
can
find
it
you
are
not
a
catholic
no
but
i
have
always
wanted
so
to
smell
from
the
censer
clouds
of
fragrance
roll
you
are
rich
in
differences
said
rachel
i
hope
we
get
along
well
together
i
think
we
will
is
there
anything
else
you
can
think
of
at
the
moment
i
want
to
see
the
salvation
army
that
may
be
managed
if
you
are
willing
to
take
it
in
detachments
and
i
want
oh
i
want
to
go
somewhere
where
i
can
really
see
the
ocean
i
get
father
to
take
us
down
to
brighton
beach
it
is
too
late
this
mild
weather
this
morning
said
hagar
we
came
through
miles
i
think
of
places
where
poor
people
live
i
want
to
see
all
that
again
it
is
very
edifying
but
we
can
get
under
the
wing
of
some
association
and
do
a
little
mild
slumming
i
want
to
go
down
there
alone
and
often
that
said
rachel
is
impossible
why
it
is
not
done
besides
it
would
be
dangerous
dangerous
you
might
take
any
disease
or
get
into
any
kind
of
trouble
there
are
all
sorts
of
traps
why
should
they
set
traps
oh
all
kinds
of
horrors
just
look
at
the
newspapers
a
girl
alone
you
be
subjected
to
insult
hagar
sighed
i
always
been
alone
and
i
do
see
that
we
are
not
subjected
to
insult
everywhere
i
could
never
feel
more
insulted
than
sometimes
i
have
been
at
home
rachel
turning
in
her
chair
darted
at
her
a
glance
of
comprehension
well
that
true
enough
though
i
never
heard
it
put
into
words
before
it
true
but
it
remains
that
with
our
present
conventions
you
must
have
company
when
you
go
to
see
how
the
other
half
lives
the
other
half
it
a
term
one
half
of
us
does
know
how
the
other
half
lives
i
see
said
hagar
well
i
be
glad
when
i
get
out
of
fractions
both
laughed
a
kind
of
soft
friendly
brightness
prevailed
in
the
back
bedroom
there
was
no
open
fire
but
they
sat
on
either
side
of
the
little
squat
table
and
the
with
a
yellowy
globe
did
the
job
of
a
common
luminary
the
light
reached
out
to
each
and
linked
them
together
rachel
bolt
was
small
and
dark
and
slender
much
of
the
time
she
passed
for
a
cynical
and
rather
melancholy
young
woman
then
occasionally
sheaths
parted
like
opening
wings
and
something
showed
that
was
vivid
and
deep
and
duskily
luminous
the
next
moment
the
rift
might
close
but
there
had
been
received
an
impression
of
the
inward
depths
she
had
been
married
at
eighteen
her
first
child
born
a
year
later
she
was
now
and
had
been
a
widow
for
two
years
in
worldly
wisdom
and
and
in
several
emotional
experiences
she
was
well
ahead
of
hagar
but
in
other
respects
the
brain
ways
of
the
younger
in
years
were
deeper
and
older
whatever
differences
their
planes
were
near
enough
for
a
comprehension
that
continually
deepening
passed
before
long
into
the
country
of
lasting
friendship
chapter
xv
looking
for
thomasine
when
hagar
had
been
ten
days
in
new
york
she
went
early
one
afternoon
to
find
thomasine
she
had
the
address
and
upon
showing
it
to
rachel
the
latter
had
pronounced
it
poor
but
respectable
adding
are
you
sure
you
ought
to
go
alone
to
go
alone
ought
to
go
alone
i
am
so
tired
of
that
phrase
to
go
alone
said
hagar
at
gilead
balm
they
said
go
beyond
the
cedar
you
say
yourself
that
i
could
get
lost
and
i
was
brought
up
with
thomasine
and
jim
and
his
wife
are
perfectly
good
people
downstairs
as
she
was
passing
the
parlour
doors
maine
called
to
her
from
within
where
are
you
going
dear
hagar
entered
and
explained
that
is
very
nice
of
you
to
look
her
up
but
do
you
think
you
ought
to
go
alone
hagar
explained
that
too
whereupon
maine
patted
her
hand
and
told
her
to
trot
along
but
always
to
be
careful
as
the
front
door
closed
after
her
her
hostess
resumed
her
box
of
chocolates
and
the
baby
sacque
she
was
knitting
it
is
as
though
i
had
promised
to
give
her
or
to
make
rachel
give
her
continual
chaperonage
to
look
after
her
in
a
general
way
is
all
that
could
possibly
be
expected
besides
it
foolish
always
to
be
nervous
about
people
she
took
a
chocolate
cream
and
began
the
sleeve
medway
ashendyne
with
all
those
millions
is
doing
very
much
for
her
she
could
dress
more
plainly
if
she
tried
i
wonder
what
he
means
to
do
with
her
eventually
perhaps
he
does
mean
anything
just
to
let
things
drift
hagar
knew
how
to
orientate
herself
very
well
she
took
the
surface
car
going
in
the
right
direction
and
when
she
had
travelled
some
distance
she
left
it
and
took
a
car
this
brought
her
to
the
block
she
wished
out
of
the
jingling
car
across
a
street
of
and
drays
and
hurrying
dodging
people
she
stood
upon
the
broken
and
littered
pavement
a
moment
to
look
about
her
the
houses
were
tall
and
dreary
once
good
a
house
to
a
family
but
now
not
so
good
and
several
families
to
a
house
the
corners
were
occupied
by
larger
buildings
unadorned
and
and
ugly
each
with
a
name
each
containing
flats
flats
and
flats
and
flats
each
with
its
ground
floor
occupied
by
small
stores
unprosperous
greengrocer
unprosperous
butcher
poor
chemist
prosperous
saloon
and
what
not
it
was
a
grimy
chilly
grey
afternoon
with
more
than
a
hint
of
the
approaching
winter
all
voices
seemed
raw
and
all
colours
cold
among
the
children
playing
on
the
pavement
and
in
areaways
or
on
high
broken
entrance
steps
there
sounded
more
crying
than
laughing
dirty
papers
were
blown
up
and
down
there
floated
an
odour
of
stale
beer
an
man
went
by
ringing
a
bell
and
crying
harshly
old
clothes
old
clothes
got
any
rags
hagar
stood
with
contracted
brows
she
shivered
a
little
why
thomasine
should
not
live
in
a
place
like
this
she
looked
about
her
who
should
she
had
a
vision
of
thomasine
playing
thomasine
looking
for
clovers
but
when
she
climbed
to
the
third
floor
of
one
of
the
corner
buildings
and
standing
in
the
perpetual
twilight
of
the
rang
the
bell
of
a
door
from
which
much
of
the
paint
had
been
scarred
she
found
that
thomasine
did
not
live
there
the
door
was
opened
by
a
gaunt
woman
thomasine
dale
did
she
live
with
marietta
green
and
jim
yes
she
is
jim
niece
well
she
do
live
here
now
may
i
see
jim
or
his
wife
they
do
live
here
neither
the
door
across
the
landing
opened
and
a
stout
woman
in
a
checked
apron
looked
out
was
you
looking
for
the
greens
yes
please
if
you
come
in
and
set
a
minute
i
tell
you
about
them
i
got
asthmy
and
there
an
awful
draught
comes
up
those
steps
hagar
sat
down
in
an
orange
plush
and
the
stout
woman
having
removed
her
apron
took
the
green
and
purple
sofa
there
now
i
meant
to
mend
that
carpet
and
she
covered
the
hole
with
the
sole
of
her
shoe
i
am
as
fond
as
i
can
be
of
the
greens
jim
a
good
man
and
if
marietta
so
delicate
she
manage
better
the
children
are
nice
youngsters
too
well
i
sorry
they
gone
but
jim
hurt
his
arm
down
in
the
works
and
marietta
could
seem
to
get
strong
again
after
the
last
baby
and
cutting
wages
when
they
ai
turning
men
off
short
and
jim
turn
come
for
all
he
always
been
good
and
sober
and
a
good
workman
first
the
works
hurt
his
arm
and
then
it
said
that
he
was
so
useful
now
and
then
it
said
that
it
had
seen
for
a
long
time
that
it
would
have
to
economize
and
the
men
could
choose
between
cut
wages
or
no
wages
at
all
and
jim
was
one
of
them
it
said
it
to
so
he
had
to
take
the
cut
she
began
to
cough
and
wheeze
and
then
to
pant
for
breath
did
you
ever
have
the
asthmy
i
going
off
with
it
some
day
glass
of
water
yes
next
room
cup
by
the
sink
thank
you
child
real
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
was
jim
and
marietta
and
the
children
and
thomasine
who
had
to
economize
where
are
they
gone
asked
hagar
sorrowfully
it
is
so
awful
far
from
here
i
give
you
the
address
the
car
at
the
corner
take
you
there
pretty
quick
but
it
ai
nowhere
near
so
nice
a
neighbourhood
or
a
house
as
this
she
regarded
her
plush
furniture
and
nottingham
curtains
with
pride
thomasine
an
awful
nice
girl
yes
said
hagar
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
i
love
thomasine
i
ought
to
have
waited
so
long
before
coming
to
find
her
but
i
never
thought
of
all
this
it
never
entered
my
head
she
got
an
awful
good
place
for
a
woman
nine
dollars
a
week
she
could
have
kept
a
room
here
but
she
awful
fond
of
jim
and
marietta
and
the
children
and
she
went
with
them
i
reckon
she
help
right
sharp
this
winter
the
stores
take
to
cutting
too
on
the
the
new
address
in
her
hand
hagar
considered
poverty
it
was
there
in
person
to
illustrate
in
an
opposite
row
of
an√¶mic
anxious
faces
and
forms
none
too
warmly
clad
it
was
there
on
the
street
going
up
and
down
it
was
there
in
the
houses
that
were
so
gaunt
defaced
and
ugly
the
very
november
air
cold
and
querulous
seemed
poor
her
mind
was
sorting
and
comparing
impressions
she
had
known
when
she
came
to
think
of
it
a
good
deal
of
poverty
and
a
number
of
poor
people
in
the
first
place
she
had
been
brought
up
on
the
tradition
of
the
poverty
after
the
war
but
that
had
been
heroic
exalted
poverty
in
which
all
shared
and
where
they
kept
the
amenities
then
when
that
had
passed
there
were
the
steadygoing
poor
people
in
the
country
those
who
had
always
been
poor
and
apparently
always
would
be
so
but
it
did
not
seem
to
hurt
so
in
the
country
and
certainly
it
was
not
so
ugly
often
it
was
not
ugly
at
all
of
course
everybody
at
home
in
a
cheerful
tone
of
voice
called
the
greens
poor
people
the
greens
were
poor
and
isham
were
poor
she
remembered
with
a
curious
vividness
the
poor
woman
on
the
canal
boat
the
summer
her
mother
died
she
had
even
heard
the
colonel
say
that
he
the
colonel
was
poor
of
course
she
had
seen
hosts
of
poor
people
and
yet
until
or
rather
to
be
more
precise
until
the
morning
of
the
ferry
and
the
elevated
she
had
never
generalized
poverty
never
conceived
it
abstractly
poverty
what
was
poverty
why
was
poverty
was
it
a
constant
was
it
going
to
last
if
so
why
if
it
was
going
to
last
what
was
going
to
make
things
better
it
was
desirable
that
things
should
be
better
oh
desirable
desirable
the
slave
of
beauty
and
the
slave
of
righteousness
in
hagar
soul
rose
together
and
looked
upon
the
and
the
shards
that
were
thrown
upon
it
it
should
be
there
is
no
need
and
no
sense
four
or
five
summers
past
visiting
with
miss
serena
some
coltsworth
or
ashendyne
house
in
the
country
and
exploring
as
she
always
did
almost
at
once
the
bookcases
she
had
come
upon
tucked
away
in
the
extreme
shadow
of
a
shadowy
shelf
a
copy
of
william
news
from
nowhere
hagar
had
long
since
come
to
the
conviction
that
her
taste
was
radically
different
from
that
of
most
coltsworths
and
ashendynes
where
they
tucked
away
she
drew
forth
she
had
read
news
from
nowhere
upon
that
visit
but
she
had
read
it
hurriedly
amid
distractions
and
she
was
much
younger
then
than
now
it
had
left
with
her
chiefly
an
impression
of
a
certain
kind
of
haunting
beauty
she
remembered
the
boy
and
the
girl
in
the
playing
merchant
and
the
cherry
trees
in
the
streets
and
the
cottage
of
ellen
and
ellen
herself
and
the
harvest
home
why
it
was
written
or
what
it
was
trying
to
show
she
had
not
felt
then
with
any
clearness
now
somehow
the
book
came
back
to
her
that
was
what
from
nowhere
was
trying
to
show
that
people
might
work
work
well
and
enough
and
yet
there
be
for
all
beauty
and
comfort
and
leisure
and
friendliness
i
see
if
i
can
find
that
book
and
read
it
again
the
car
stopped
at
the
indicated
when
she
was
out
upon
the
pavement
and
again
stood
a
moment
to
look
about
her
she
was
frightened
this
was
the
region
of
the
down
the
faces
of
the
buildings
the
ramshackle
buildings
it
was
the
region
of
the
black
windows
and
the
women
leaning
out
and
the
wan
children
this
street
was
narrower
than
the
other
grimier
and
more
untidy
more
crowded
colder
and
the
voice
of
it
never
died
it
rose
to
a
clamour
it
sank
to
a
murmur
but
it
never
vanished
usually
it
kept
a
strident
midway
idle
and
fretful
as
the
interminable
blown
litter
of
the
street
hagar
drew
a
pained
breath
thomasine
got
no
business
living
here
nor
jim
and
marietta
and
the
children
either
but
it
seemed
when
she
mounted
a
dirty
narrow
stair
and
made
enquiries
of
a
person
she
met
atop
it
seemed
that
they
did
live
there
they
moved
out
a
week
ago
the
man
was
in
some
damned
works
or
other
and
it
threw
him
on
the
with
about
a
thousand
more
then
the
place
where
the
girl
worked
thought
were
so
pretty
that
it
started
one
too
then
he
heard
a
report
of
work
to
be
had
over
in
new
jersey
as
if
if
this
is
the
that
the
fire
and
so
they
left
this
state
no
they
did
leave
any
address
working
people
address
this
year
is
it
care
of
the
unemployed
sometimes
it
just
plain
under
the
man
looked
at
hagar
and
hagar
looked
at
the
man
she
thought
that
he
had
the
angriest
gloomiest
eyes
she
had
ever
seen
and
yet
they
were
not
wicked
eyes
they
blazed
out
of
the
dark
entryway
at
her
but
for
all
their
glowing
they
were
what
she
denominated
eyes
they
seemed
to
look
through
her
at
something
big
and
black
beyond
have
you
seen
the
evening
paper
he
asked
abruptly
no
i
have
not
why
i
wanted
to
see
this
morning
had
an
account
of
three
anarchist
a
bomb
in
barcelona
a
bomb
in
milan
and
a
bomb
in
no
i
ca
tell
you
anything
more
about
your
friends
yes
sorry
it
a
hard
world
but
there
a
better
time
coming
grieving
and
bewildered
she
came
out
upon
the
pavement
why
thomasine
why
had
jim
let
them
know
if
there
was
anything
at
home
for
jim
to
do
and
she
agreed
that
there
was
nor
for
thomasine
still
they
could
all
have
stayed
there
and
waited
for
a
while
until
jim
arm
and
hard
times
got
better
she
tried
to
put
them
all
there
were
six
in
the
overseer
house
with
green
it
would
be
crowded
but
the
overseer
house
was
her
grandfather
green
had
had
it
rent
free
since
william
green
death
and
most
of
her
cornmeal
and
flour
came
from
the
colonel
hand
hagar
tried
to
say
to
herself
that
her
grandfather
would
be
glad
to
see
jim
and
marietta
and
thomasine
and
the
three
children
there
staying
with
green
as
long
as
was
necessary
that
if
it
were
crowded
in
the
overseer
house
her
grandmother
would
be
glad
to
have
thomasine
and
perhaps
one
of
the
children
stay
in
the
big
house
it
would
not
work
it
came
to
her
too
that
perhaps
jim
and
marietta
and
thomasine
might
not
be
so
fond
of
coming
and
sitting
down
on
green
and
saying
we
failed
but
could
they
work
in
the
country
jim
was
a
mechanic
he
did
know
anything
about
farming
and
the
farmers
were
having
a
hard
time
too
hagar
head
began
to
ache
then
the
travelling
expenses
she
tried
to
count
those
up
if
they
could
pay
the
rent
how
could
they
pay
for
six
to
go
down
to
virginia
and
the
children
clothes
and
the
food
and
everything
was
there
no
one
who
could
send
them
money
green
could
she
knew
and
thomasine
mother
and
father
were
very
poor
and
corker
was
doing
well
and
maggie
was
at
home
nursing
their
mother
whose
spine
was
bad
gilead
balm
had
a
kindly
feeling
for
the
greens
she
knew
that
william
green
had
been
a
good
overseer
and
he
had
fought
in
the
regiment
the
colonel
led
her
grandfather
if
he
knew
how
bad
it
was
if
he
could
see
these
places
where
they
had
been
living
if
he
could
have
heard
the
woman
in
the
check
apron
and
the
man
with
the
eyes
he
might
send
jim
dollars
he
might
even
send
him
fifty
dollars
though
she
doubted
if
he
could
do
that
much
she
herself
had
twenty
dollars
left
of
that
august
two
hundred
she
had
been
saving
it
for
christmas
presents
for
gilead
balm
but
now
she
was
going
to
send
it
to
thomasine
just
as
soon
as
she
knew
where
to
send
it
she
walked
on
for
a
little
way
in
a
hopeful
glow
and
then
the
bottom
dropped
out
of
that
too
it
would
go
far
or
do
much
it
was
too
small
a
cloth
to
wrap
a
giant
in
jim
and
unemployment
jim
injured
arm
hurt
in
the
works
marietta
weak
and
worn
trying
to
care
for
a
little
baby
other
mariettas
jims
thomasines
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
they
were
willing
and
wanting
to
work
they
were
not
lazy
jim
had
injured
his
own
arm
apparently
there
had
to
be
babies
unemployment
and
no
one
to
help
when
help
was
needed
it
needed
a
giant
all
of
us
together
could
do
it
all
of
us
together
she
was
cold
even
under
her
warm
jacket
and
with
her
thick
gloves
the
street
looked
horribly
cold
but
she
did
not
notice
many
jackets
and
no
gloves
with
all
her
nature
she
hated
the
squalid
nothing
so
depressed
her
she
had
not
seen
it
before
so
verily
itself
in
the
country
it
was
apt
to
have
a
draping
and
setting
of
beauty
even
a
pigpen
might
be
environed
by
blossoming
fruit
trees
here
squalor
environed
squalor
ugliness
ugliness
on
a
step
before
her
sat
a
forlorn
little
girl
of
eight
or
nine
taking
care
of
a
large
baby
wrapped
in
a
shawl
hagar
stopped
and
spoke
are
you
cold
the
child
shook
her
head
are
you
hungry
she
shook
it
still
then
suddenly
broke
forth
volubly
in
a
strange
tongue
she
was
telling
her
something
but
what
could
not
be
made
out
the
door
behind
opened
and
elizabeth
eden
came
forth
she
spoke
to
the
child
kindly
in
her
own
language
with
a
caressing
touch
upon
the
shoulder
the
little
girl
nodded
gathered
up
the
baby
and
went
into
the
house
miss
eden
elizabeth
turned
what
why
miss
ashendyne
did
you
drop
out
of
the
sky
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
in
omega
street
i
came
down
here
to
find
some
people
whom
i
know
i
am
visiting
in
new
york
oh
i
glad
to
see
you
we
ca
stand
here
the
settlement
is
just
two
blocks
away
ca
you
come
with
me
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
where
are
you
staying
hagar
told
her
adding
i
must
be
back
before
dark
or
they
wo
let
me
come
out
again
by
myself
it
is
quite
four
i
put
you
on
the
elevated
in
plenty
of
what
people
were
you
looking
for
hagar
told
her
as
they
walked
elizabeth
listened
knew
nothing
of
them
but
said
gravely
that
it
was
a
common
lot
nowadays
i
have
seen
many
hard
winters
but
this
promises
to
be
one
of
the
worst
she
advised
writing
guardedly
to
green
until
she
found
out
how
thomasine
and
jim
wrote
themselves
they
may
not
be
telling
her
how
bad
it
is
and
if
she
can
not
help
it
is
right
that
they
should
i
believe
too
in
being
hopeful
if
they
sturdy
intelligent
people
they
weather
the
gale
somehow
barring
accidents
it
the
miserable
accidents
the
strained
arm
your
marietta
illness
after
the
baby
things
like
that
that
tip
the
scales
against
them
well
cheer
up
child
you
may
hear
that
they
got
work
and
are
this
is
the
settlement
three
old
residences
stranded
long
years
ago
when
fashionable
society
moved
away
first
street
by
street
and
at
last
mile
by
mile
formed
the
settlement
made
one
building
by
archways

through
grave
and
plain
with
a
dignity
of
good
woodwork
and
polished
brass
and
fit
furniture
sparely
placed
the
house
had
the
poise
and
force
of
a
galleon
caught
and
held
intact
in
the
arms
of
some
sargasso
sea
all
around
it
were
wrecks
of
many
natures
strangled
pinned
down
and
disintegrating
but
it
had
not
disintegrated
one
use
and
custom
had
left
it
but
another
had
passed
in
with
a
nobler
plan
hagar
ashendyne
went
through
the
place
wondering
saw
the
workrooms
the
classrooms
the
the
austere
with
a
quiet
goodness
and
fairness
of
the
people
who
dwelled
there
and
made
the
heart
of
the
place
it
is
not
like
a
convent
she
said
in
a
low
voice
at
least
i
imagine
it
is
not
and
yet
oh
the
two
ideas
have
a
point
of
contact
answered
elizabeth
cheerfully
only
here
the
emphasis
is
laid
on
action
she
met
several
people
whom
she
thought
she
would
like
to
meet
again
and
at
the
last
minute
came
in
marie
caton
it
was
marie
who
at
five
put
her
on
the
elevated
that
would
take
her
home
in
twenty
minutes
marie
had
met
the
maines
i
southern
too
you
know
and
she
promised
to
come
to
see
hagar
and
she
said
that
hagar
and
rachel
bolt
must
come
some
sunday
afternoon
to
the
settlement
that
is
chiefly
when
we
see
our
personal
friends
that
night
hagar
wrote
to
her
grandmother
and
to
green
in
four
days
time
she
heard
from
the
latter
yes
jim
and
all
of
them
and
thomasine
had
moved
to
new
jersey
times
were
hard
jim
said
and
work
was
slack
and
they
thought
they
could
better
themselves
sure
enough
he
had
got
a
right
good
job
they
were
living
where
it
so
crowded
as
it
was
in
new
york
almost
in
the
country
right
by
a
big
mill
there
was
a
row
of
houses
just
alike
thomasine
said
and
they
were
living
in
one
of
them
there
was
any
yard
but
you
could
walk
into
the
country
and
see
the
woods
and
thomasine
said
the
sky
was
wonderful
at
night
all
red
from
a
furnace
thomasine
had
got
work
yet
but
she
thought
that
she
would
there
was
a
place
where
they
made
silk
into
ribbons
and
she
thought
there
be
a
place
for
her
there
marietta
was
better
and
the
children
were
fine
green
sent
the
address
and
gilead
balm
certainly
missed
hagar
old
miss
wrote
an
explanatory
letter
hagar
knew
or
ought
to
know
that
they
had
little
or
nothing
but
the
place
the
colonel
had
been
in
debt
but
medway
had
cleared
that
off
as
it
was
right
that
he
should
now
that
he
was
able
to
do
it
right
and
kind
but
as
for
ready
money
country
people
never
had
any
ready
money
she
knew
that
perfectly
well
medway
was
now
old
miss
supposed
a
rich
man
but
no
one
knew
exactly
how
rich
and
at
any
rate
it
was
his
money
and
living
abroad
as
he
did
was
of
course
expensive
he
could
justly
be
expected
to
do
much
more
than
he
was
doing
as
for
your
having
money
to
give
the
greens
you
have
any
child
medway
has
told
your
grandfather
that
he
wants
you
from
now
on
to
have
every
proper
advantage
but
that
he
does
not
believe
in
the
way
young
people
squander
money
nor
does
he
want
you
to
depart
from
what
you
have
been
taught
at
gilead
balm
he
wants
you
to
remain
modest
in
your
wants
as
every
woman
should
be
the
money
he
has
put
in
your
hands
for
you
this
year
is
to
pay
for
this
winter
in
new
york
and
for
wherever
you
go
next
summer
he
never
meant
it
to
be
diverted
to
helping
people
without
any
claim
upon
him
that
are
out
of
employment
your
grandfather
wo
hear
to
any
such
thing
as
you
propose
he
says
your
idea
of
coming
home
and
using
the
money
you
are
costing
in
new
york
is
preposterous
the
money
is
your
money
it
your
money
to
be
used
as
he
and
not
as
you
direct
of
course
a
hard
year
and
of
course
there
are
people
suffering
there
always
are
but
jim
a
man
and
can
get
work
and
thomasine
ought
to
have
gone
away
from
home
anyhow
they
are
starving
child
so
old
miss
and
more
to
the
same
effect
and
then
at
the
end
a
postscript
i
had
a
that
been
lying
by
me
a
long
time
and
i
taken
it
to
mary
green
and
told
her
to
send
it
to
jim
she
seemed
surprised
and
from
what
she
says
and
what
his
letter
says
i
think
they
are
any
worse
off
than
most
people
you
young
and
your
feelings
run
away
with
you
hagar
wrote
a
long
loving
letter
to
thomasine
and
sent
her
the
twenty
dollars
thomasine
returned
her
effusive
pretty
thanks
showed
that
she
was
glad
and
glad
enough
to
have
the
help
but
insisted
that
she
should
regard
it
as
a
loan
she
acknowledged
that
jim
and
she
and
therefore
marietta
and
the
babies
had
been
pretty
hard
up
but
things
were
better
she
hopefully
said
she
had
a
place
and
jim
had
a
place
his
arm
was
about
well
and
on
the
whole
they
liked
new
jersey
though
it
is
as
interesting

course
as

a

suffrage
amendment
was
strongly

was
more
talk
than

of

among

more
editorials
than
usual
upon
the
phenomenon
more
magazine
articles
but
the
bulk
of
the
talk
and
the
editorials
and
the
magazine
articles
had
to
do
with
the
business
failures
and
the
unemployed
and
the
strikes
the
beating
of
the
waves
of
the
year
was
not
loudly
heard
in
the
maines
long
parlour
the
law
droned
on
bad
years
with
good
powhatan
had
speculated
and
made
his
little
losses
his
philosophy
this
winter
was
pessimistic
and
the
household
economized
but
the
table
was
still
good
and
plentiful
and
the
coloured
servants
who
were
fond
of
him
and
he
of
them
smiled
and
bobbed
and
he
had
not
felt
it
necessary
to
change
his
brand
of
cigars
and
the
same
old
people
came
in
the
evening
maine
never
read
the
newspapers
she
rarely
read
anything
though
once
in
a
while
she
took
up
an
old
favourite
of
her
youth
and
placidly
dipped
now
into
it
and
now
into
her
box
of
chocolates
powhatan
kept
her
supplied
with
the
chocolates
twice
a
week
when
he
came
in
at
five
he
produced
out
of
his
overcoat
pocket
a
glazed
white
box
chocolates
bessie
catch
rachel
bolt
was
more
alert
to
the
world
surge
but
to
her
too
it
must
come
a
little
muted
through
the
family
atmosphere
her
swiftest
vibrations
were
upon
other
lines
curious
inner
personal
revolts
and
rebellions
sometimes
consumed
below
the
crust
sometimes
breaking
forth
with
a
flare
and
rain
of
words
as
of
lava
the
family
and
the
people
who
habitually
came
to
the
house
were
used
to
rachel
way
of
talking
as
long
as
she
did
nothing
and
she
did
not
it
was
no
more
to
them
than
a
painted
volcano
as
for
sylvie
sylvie
was
as
sweet
and
likeable
as
sugar
but
not
interested
in
anything
outside
of
the
porcelain
that
held
her
she
liked
her
clothes
this
winter
and
the
young
men
who
came
to
the
house
and
she
dutifully
practised
her
voice
and
enjoyed
the
shops
and
the
plays
and
wondered
a
good
deal
if
she
was
or
was
not
in
love
with
jack
carter
who
was
an
interne
in
one
of
the
hospitals
and
who
sent
her
every
week
six
of
the
new
roses
called
american
beauties
she
had
other
more
distant
relatives
in
new
york
people
of
wealth
who
presently
took
her
up
she
was
with
them
and
away
from
the
maines
a
good
deal
and
on
the
whole
hagar
saw
not
much
of
sylvie
this
winter
she
and
rachel
were
more
together
almost
every
evening
at
the
maines
people
came
in
old
southern
friends
living
in
new
york
or
here
on
business
or
other
occasions
young
men
and
women
fond
of
rachel
acceptable
from
the
fold
of
timothy
now
and
then
the
rector
himself
now
and
then
some
young
man
southern
with
a
letter
of
introduction
sometimes
there
were
but
one
or
two
besides
the
family
sometimes
seven
or
eight
there
was
little
or
no
formal
entertainment
but
this
kind
of
thing
always
each
day
at
dusk
hagar
put
on
one
of
the
two
gowns
which
at
the
last
moment
miss
serena
had
insisted
she
must
have
both
were
simplicity
itself
both
of
some
soft
cr√™py
stuff
one
dark
bronze
and
one
dark
green
they
were
made
with
the
large
puffed
sleeves
of
the
period
and
the
throat
slightly
low
and
square
but
somehow
just
right
rachel
judged
you
are
any
more
adorned
than
the
leaf
of
a
tree
and
yet
you
might
walk
just
as
you
are
into
c√¶sar
palace
usually
by
ten
visitors
were
gone
lights
downstairs
were
out
powhatan
and
bessie
believed
in
early
to
bed
and
late
to
rise
upstairs
in
her
bedroom
on
the
third
floor
hagar
shook
out
and
hung
in
the
closet
the
bronze
or
green
dress
as
the
case
might
be
put
on
her
gown
and
her
red
wrapper
braided
her
hair
pushed
the
couch
well
beneath
the
light
curled
herself
up
on
it
under
the
quilt
and
tablet
against
knee
began
to
write
the
short
story
it
was
that
she
dreamed
and
wrote
and
polished
two
currents
of
thought
and
aspiration
ran
side
by
side
to
earn
money
to
make
my
own
living
to
be
able
to
help
and
to
make
this
idea
that
i
think
is
beautiful
come
forth
and
to
get
this
thing
right
to
make
this
dream
show
clear
to
do
it
to
do
it
to
create
the
latter
current
was
the
most
powerful
the
former
would
sooner
or
later
accomplish
its
end
it
would
turn
the
and
be
content
but
the
latter
never
never
would
it
be
satisfied
never
would
it
say
it
is
accomplished
always
there
would
be
the
further
dream
always
the
necessity
to
make
that
too
come
clear
there
were
other
currents
more
or
less
strong
desire
of
fame
desire
to
be
known
desire
to
excel
and
others
but
the
first
two
were
the
great
currents
since
march
and
the
fairy
story
she
had
written
other
stories
four
or
five
in
all
she
had
sent
them
to
magazines
and
all
but
one
had
come
back
that
one
she
had
sent
immediately
after
her
search
for
thomasine
in
a
month
she
had
word
that
it
was
taken
and
that
on
publication
she
would
be
paid
fifty
dollars
the
letter
was
like
manna
she
went
about
all
day
with
a
rapt
face
to
write
to
write
to
write
stories
like
hawthorne
like
poe
she
had
been
six
weeks
in
new
york
that
night
when
she
had
worked
for
an
hour
over
one
and
then
the
light
out
had
sat
for
a
long
while
in
the
window
looking
at
the
winter
stars
above
the
city
roofs
she
could
not
sleep
when
she
went
to
bed
but
lay
straight
and
still
a
pageant
of
impressions
waves
of
repeated
altered
rearranged
contacts
drove
through
her
mind
the
pictures
and
marbles
of
the
metropolitan
the
sculptures
and
casts
of
sculptures
which
she
cared
for
more
than
for
the
paintings
those
of
the
latter
which
she
loved
the
music
that
she
had
heard
the
plays
she
had
seen
the
park
and
the
slow
interminable
afternoon
parade
of
carriages
watched
from
a
bench
beneath
the
trees
fifth
avenue
broadway
the
hurrying
crowds
the
rush
and
roar
tramp
and
clangour
the
colour
and
bravura
omega
street
the
settlement
a
sunday
afternoon
there
discussions
to
which
she
had
listened
a
mass
meeting
of
strikers
which
powhatan
having
taken
her
downtown
to
show
her
the
stock
exchange
and
trinity
they
had
inadvertently
fringed
and
from
which
with
epithets
of
disapproval
he
had
hurried
her
away
uptown
once
more
and
the
florists
windows
and
the
wheels
on
the
asphalt
a
sunday
morning
at
timothy
with
the
stained
glass
and
the
nephew
intoning
again
the
theatres
a
gilbert
and
sullivan
opera
the
merchant
of
venice
a
play
of
pinero
again
the
pictures
and
the
statues
the
cast
of
the
great
venus
the
cast
of
niobe
of
the
diana
with
the
hound
of
apollo
and
hermes
the
pictures
rembrandts
and
vandykes
and
certain
landscapes
and
a
form
that
she
liked
firelit
and
vague
blind
nydia
moving
through
ruining
pompeii
and
bastien
lepage
joan
of
arc
then
the
park
again
and
the
great
trees
above
the
mall
and
people
people
people
all
made
a
vibrating
whirl
vast
and
with
strange
harmonies
she
lay
until
it
passed
and
sank
like
the
sand
of
the
desert
when
at
last
she
slept
she
had
a
curious
dream
she
and
her
mother
were
alone
on
an
island
with
palm
trees
she
was
used
to
being
with
her
mother
in
dreams
she
had
for
the
memory
of
her
mother
so
passionate
a
loyalty
the
figure
of
maria
young
it
always
seemed
to
her
as
herself
so
kept
abreast
with
her
inner
life
that
it
was
but
a
naturalness
that
she
should
be
there
in
the
dream
mind
too
she
was
there
now
on
the
island
with
the
palm
trees
and
the
two
sat
and
looked
at
the
sea
which
was
very
blue
then
right
out
of
the
lonely
sea
there
grew
a
crowded
wharf
with
a
white
steamship
and
people
going
to
it
and
coming
from
it
her
father
came
from
it
dressed
in
white
with
a
white
hat
like
a
helmet
and
then
suddenly
there
was
no
wharf
nor
ship
but
they
were
in
a
curious
street
of
low
houses
her
father
and
her
mother
and
herself
and
the
palm
trees
now
we
are
all
going
to
be
happy
together
she
said
but
no
said
her
mother
wait
until
the
procession
passes
then
there
was
a
procession
and
they
were
all
women
and
at
first
they
all
had
the
face
and
eyes
of
bastien
lepage
joan
of
arc
but
then
that
faded
and
they
were
simply
many
women
but
each
of
them
carried
a
blossoming
bough
she
saw
faces
that
she
knew
among
them
and
she
saw
women
that
she
thought
belonged
to
the
middle
ages
and
greek
women
and
egyptians
and
savages
they
went
by
for
a
long
time
and
then
with
a
turn
of
the
hand
the
dream
changed
and
they
were
all
in
a
courtyard
with
a
well
and
more
palm
trees
and
people
coming
and
going
and
they
were
eating
and
drinking
and
there
was
a
third
woman
with
them
whom
her
father
called
anna
she
had
a
string
of
jewels
and
she
tried
them
first
on
hagar
and
then
on
maria
but
maria
had
a
knife
and
suddenly
she
struck
at
her
father
with
it
she
cut
him
across
both
wrists
and
the
blood
hagar
wakened
and
sat
up
in
bed
shivering
her
father
face
was
still
plain
against
her
eyeballs
bearded
and
handsome
with
red
in
his
cheeks
and
the
hat
like
a
helmet
during
christmas
week
ralph
coltsworth
appeared
he
had
to
spend
his
holidays
somewhere
he
said
hawk
nest
was
dull
and
he
did
like
gilead
balm
without
hagar

the
feeling
in
your
finger
tips

gipsy
that
something
like
that
is
the
career
for
a
man
like
me
if
i
had
been
my
father
i
could
have
waved
my
sword
and
gone
charging
down

but
by
george
you
can
corner
things

that
you
want
to
become
a
rich
man
that
what
most
of
those
others
wanted
yes
riches
and
power
i
was
reading
the
other
day
a
magazine
article
it
said
that
the
day
when
any
american
if
he
had
energy
and
ambition
might
hope
to
make
a
great
fortune
was
past
it
said
that
the
capets
and
plantagenets
and
hapsburgs
were
all
here
that
the
dynasties
were
established
and
the
in
operation
that
young
and
adventurous
americans
might
hope
to
become
captains
of
mercenaries
or
they
might
go
in
for
being
court
chaplains
and
troubadours
oh
that
article
had
dyspepsia
said
ralph
it
is
as
easy
as
it
was
that
certain
but
it
possible
yet
in
if
you
got
an
opening
have
you
got
one
elder
and
marten
would
take
me
in
marten
was
an
old
flame
of
my
mother
and
i
got
his
son
dick
out
of
a
scrape
last
in
ten
years

see
gipsy
i
send
you
orchids
and
pearls
i
do
want
them
thank
you
ralph
ralph
took
the
flower
from
his
buttonhole
and
began
to
pluck
away
its
petals
gipsy
i
was
awfully
glad
last
summer
when
you
sent
that
eglantine
fellow
about
his
business
laydon
and
i
sent
each
other
well
the
road
clear
that
all
i
want
to
know
gipsy
ralph
it
no
use
i
not
going
to
listen
the
family
has
planned
this
ever
since
we
were
infants
when
you
used
to
come
to
hawk
nest
with
your
big
eyes
and
your
blue
gingham
dress
and
your
white
stockings
i
knew
it
somehow
even
then
even
when
i
teased
you
so
you
certainly
teased
me
do
you
remember
the
rain
barrel
no
i
do
the
family
has
set
its
heart
oh
ralph
family
can
be
such
a
tyrant
at
any
rate
ours
will
have
to
take
its
heart
off
this
ralph
turned
sullen
well
the
family
used
to
settle
it
for
women
yes
it
did
when
you
came
over
with
william
the
conqueror
do
you
want
to
me
regardless
just
as

those
millions
well

those
millions
but

father

the
colonel

letter
hagar
stopped
short
they
were
walking
in
the
park
my
father
do
you
think
i
owe
my
father
so
great
a
love
and
obedience
she
looked
before
her
steadily
down
the
vista
of
vast
leafless
trees
the
strongest
feeling
she
said
that
i
have
about
my
father
is
one
of
strong
curiosity
chapter
xvii
the
socialist
meeting
the
house
was
full
said
the
man
at
the
nothing
to
be
had
short
of
almost
the
back
row
under
the
gallery
rachel
shook
her
head
and
her
cousin
willy
maine
leaving
the
window
expressed
his
indignation
you
ought
to
have
told
me
this
afternoon
that
you
wanted
to
go
anybody
might
have
known
willy
was
from
one
of
the
sleepier
villages
in
one
of
the
sleepiest
counties
of
his
native
state
anybody
might
have
known
that
in
new
york
you
have
to
get
your
tickets
early
now
we
missed
the
show
by
now
they
were
out
of
the
swinging
doors
and
down
upon
the
pavement
the
night
was
bright
and
not
especially
cold
it
was
the
lyceum
theatre
and
they
stood
at
the
intersection
of
fourth
avenue
and
street
it
too
late
to
try
anything
else
pondered
rachel
willy
sorry
but
we
truly
did
know
we
could
go
until
the
last
minute
and
i
did
believe
it
would
be
crowded
it
a
beautiful
night
said
hagar
it
light
and
bright
and
there
are
crowds
of
people
why
ca
we
just
walk
about
until
bedtime
willy
who
was
nineteen
but
a
young
giant
pursed
his
lips
is
it
proper
for
ladies
oh
i
think
so
said
rachel
absently
but
would
it
really
amuse
you
hagar
yes
it
would
let
us
go
slowly
rachel
and
look
in
windows
and
pretend
to
be
purchasing
willy
laughed
genially
and
patronizingly
i
been
along
here
there
are
any
paris
fashions
in
these
windows
i
want
said
hagar
succinctly
to
saunter
through
the
streets
of
a
great
city
they
began
to
walk
their
faces
turned
downtown
staying
chiefly
upon
the
avenue
but
now
and
then
diverging
into
side
streets
where
there
were
lights
and
people
by
degrees
they
came
into
congested
poorer
quarters
to
willy
not
long
removed
from
a
loneliness
of
tidal
creeks
vast
stretches
of
tobacco
slow
solitary
sandy
roads
all
and
any
of
new
york
was
exciting
all
a
show
a
stimulus
swallowed
without
discrimination
that
day
rachel
had
found
occasion
to
rage
against
a
certain
closed
circle
of
conventions
the
subject
had
come
up
at
the
breakfast
table
introduced
by
a
headline
in
the
morning
paper
and
she
had
so
shocked
her
family
that
for
once
they
had
acted
as
though
the
volcano
was
real
maine
had
grown
moist
and
pink
and
had
said
precipitately
that
in
her
time
a
young
woman
whether
she
were
married
or
single
that
did
matter
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
putting
her
hand
in
the
fire
as
of
mentioning
such
things
and
powhatan
had
as
nearly
thundered
as
was
in
his
nature
to
do
rachel
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
desisted
but
she
had
gone
about
all
day
with
defiance
written
in
her
small
sombre
face
now
the
street
the
broad
stripes
of
blackness
the
thin
stripes
of
gold
light
the
sound
of
voices
and
of
many
footfalls
the
faces
when
the
light
fell
upon
them
and
the
brushing
by
of
forms
suited
her
raised
angry
and
mutinous
mood
as
for
hagar
the
street
and
its
movement
simply
became
herself
she
never
lost
the
child
and
the
poet
power
of
coalescence
it
was
before
the
days
of
waring
the
only
white
wings
upon
this
avenue
had
been
the
snowflakes
which
a
week
ago
had
fallen
thickly
which
had
been
dully
scraped
over
the
curbing
into
the
gutter
and
which
now
stayed
there
in
irregular
one
to
three
feet
in
altitude
begrimed
alpine
ranges
the
cobblestones
of
the
street
between
over
which
the
great
dray
horses
ceaselessly
passed
were
foul
enough
while
the
sidewalks
had
their
own
litter
of
torn
scraps
of
paper
cheap
cigar
ends
infinitesimal
bits
of
refuse
the
day
of
the
weirdness
of
electric
lighting
of
the
bizarre
of
motion
signs
was
not
yet
either
down
here
there
were
occasional
arc
lights
but
gas
yet
reigned
in
chief
the
shops
that
were
not
shops
for
millionaires
nor
even
for
the
quite
comfortable
all
had
their
winking
gaslights
below
them
like
chequered
walls
sprang
out
the
variegated
the
wares
displayed
were
usually
small
in
size
slight
of
value
and
high
in
colour
a
kaleidoscopic
barbaric
display
above
dark
doorways
the
frequent
three
golden
balls
showed
up
well
because
the
night
was
so
mild
and
windless
many
people
were
abroad
people
not
and
yet
not
quite
in
aspect
others
who
were
so
lounging
men
with
hopeless
faces
women
wandering
by
pinched
and
then
again
groups
or
individuals
of
a
fairly
prosperous
appearance
the
flaring
gas
showed
now
and
again
faces
that
were
evidently
alien
or
there
came
a
snatch
of
strange
jargon
a
crowd
had
gathered
at
a
street
corner
a
girl
wearing
a
poke
bonnet
with
a
red
ribbon
across
it
was
going
from
one
to
the
other
holding
out
a
tambourine
a
few
pennies
clinked
into
it
a
man
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
crowd
raised
his
arm
now
we
are
going
to
sing
the
women
in
the
bonnets
beat
upon
the
tambourines
a
man
with
a
drum
and
another
with
a
cornet
gave
the
opening
bars
the
women
raised
shrill
sweet
voices
there
is
a
fountain
filled
with
blood
drawn
from
immanuel
veins
and
sinners
plunged
beneath
that
flood
lose
all
their
guilty
stains
the
hymn
ended
a
woman
lifted
both
hands
and
prayed
with
fervour
and
a
strange
natural
eloquence
then
the
squad
gathered
up
horn
and
drum
and
tambourines
and
drawing
a
part
of
the
crowd
with
it
moved
up
the
street
to
another
skirmish
ground
rachel
and
willy
and
hagar
drifted
on
the
night
was
still
young
the
stars
glittering
above
the
gaslamps
making
a
vista
the
footfalls
on
the
pavement
murmurous
as
a
stream
the
clanging
of
the
bell
the
rush
of
a
train
on
the
neighbouring
elevated
the
abrupt
rise
and
fall
of
passing
voices
all
exercised
a
fascination
the
night
was
coloured
rhythmic
they
came
to
a
building
narrow
and
plain
with
lit
windows
as
of
a
hall
on
the
second
floor
and
with
a
clean
fairly
lighted
stair
going
up
from
an
open
street
door
men
and
women
were
entering
a
stooping
man
stood
by
the
door
with
handbills
or
leaflets
which
he
was
giving
out
socialist
meeting
he
said
good
speaking
the
unemployed
and
the
strikes
socialist
meeting
everybody
welcome
hagar
stopped
rachel
i
want
to
go
in
here
yes
i
do
come
now
be
good
to
me
rachel
maine
wants
to
go
too
socialists
said
willy
those
are
the
people
who
are
blowing
up
everybody
with
bombs
i
did
suppose
new
york
would
let
them
hold
a
meeting
they
devils
but
willy
had
so
a
human
curiosity
that
he
was
not
averse
to
a
glimpse
of
devils
perhaps
he
heard
himself
back
home
in
the
sleepy
county
talking
at
the
village
or
in
the
churchyard
before
church
yes
and
where
else
do
you
think
i
went
i
went
to
a
socialist
meeting
socialists
and
anarchists
you
know
rachel
hardly
more
informed
was
ready
for
anything
a
little
desperate
she
would
not
have
taken
hagar
where
she
positively
thought
she
ought
not
to
go
but
if
these
were
desperate
people
going
in
they
were
to
say
the
least
pretty
quiet
and
orderly
and
and
it
could
do
no
harm
just
to
slip
in
and
sit
on
a
back
seat
for
a
few
minutes
and
look
on
just
as
you
might
go
to
mass
in
a
cathedral
abroad
disapproving
all
the
time
of
course
but
hagar
had
a
book
or
two
in
her
mind
and
in
addition
the
talk
that
sunday
afternoon
at
the
settlement
when
they
had
climbed
the
stairs
and
come
into
the
hall
which
was
a
small
one
they
found
that
the
back
seats
were
all
taken
apparently
all
seats
were
taken
but
as
they
stood
hesitating
a
young
man
beckoned
and
before
they
knew
it
they
found
themselves
well
down
the
place
seated
near
the
platform
rachel
looked
around
a
little
uneasily
crowded
and
they
all
look
so
intent
it
not
going
to
be
easy
to
get
up
and
leave
the
hall
was
rude
enough
and
small
the
light
not
brilliant
the
platform
a
few
bare
boards
upon
it
stood
a
deal
table
and
three
or
four
chairs
back
of
these
fastened
against
the
wall
was
a
red
flag
and
on
either
side
of
this
a
strip
of
canvas
with
large
letters
on
one
side
universal
brotherhood
and
on
the
other
workingmen
unite
now
standing
beside
the
table
and
slowly
walking
from
end
to
end
of
the
platform
a
man
was
speaking
quite
conversationally
with
a
direct
appeal
now
to
this
quarter
of
the
hall
now
to
that
his
voice
was
deep
and
mellow
he
spoke
without
denunciations
with
a
quiet
reasonableness
and
conviction
at
the
moment
he
was
stating
a
theory
giving
the
data
upon
which
it
was
based
weighing
it
comparing
it
with
its
counter
theory
he
used
phrases
economic
determinism
unearned
increment
problem
of
distribution
explained
clearly
what
he
meant
by
them
then
put
them
aside
they
are
phrases
that
will
serve
their
ends
and
pass
from
speech
he
said
we
shall
bring
in
modifiers
we
shall
make
other
phrases
and
they
too
in
their
turn
will
pass
from
the
tongues
of
men
but
the
idea
behind
them
the
idea
the
idea
and
its
expression
the
intellectual
and
moral
sanction
the
thing
that
is
metaphysical
and
immortal
that
will
not
pass
the
very
word
socialism
may
pass
but
socialism
itself
will
be
in
the
blood
and
bone
and
marrow
of
the
world
that
is
to
be
and
this
is
what
is
that
socialism
he
began
to
speak
in
aphorisms
in
words
from
old
and
then
for
all
they
were
stories
of
quite
modern
happenings
in
parables
the
woe
of
the
world
epitomized
a
generalization
of
its
needs
all
lines
of
help
synthesized
into
a
world
saviour
which
lo
was
the
world
itself
he
made
an
end
stood
a
moment
with
kindling
eyes
then
sat
down
after
an
appreciable
silence
there
came
a
strange
deep
applause
men
and
women
striking
fist
on
palm
striking
the
bare
floor
with
feet
a
small
wiry
dark
man
sitting
on
the
platform
rose
and
spoke
rapidly
for
twenty
minutes
he
had
a
caustic
wit
and
the
power
of
invective
which
if
possessed
by
the
other
had
not
been
displayed
once
or
twice
he
evoked
a
roar
of
angry
laughter
when
he
had
finished
and
the
applause
had
subsided
the
chairman
of
the
evening
stood
up
and
spoke
as
the
comrades
know
it
is
our
habit
to
turn
the
last
into
an
open
meeting
nearly
always
there
somebody
who
been
thinking
and
studying
and
wants
to
say
a
word
as
to
what
he
found
or
somebody
who
got
a
bit
of
personal
experience
that
he
thinks
might
help
a
comrade
who
struggling
maybe
through
a
like
pit
anybody
that
feels
like
speaking
out
let
him
do
it
or
let
her
do
it
men
and
women
we
all
comrades
and
though
socialists
are
said
not
to
be
religious
we
all
religious
enough
to
like
a
good
experience
meeting
he
paused
waiting
for
some
one
to
rise
the
first
speaker
came
for
a
moment
to
his
side
chairman
may
i
say
one
word
to
our
comrades
and
to
any
others
who
may
be
here
it
is
this
if
means
and
a
recognition
and
a
striving
toward
the
ultimate
divine
in
my
neighbour
as
in
myself
and
in
myself
as
in
my
neighbour
then
i
think
socialism
may
be
called
religious
as
he
moved
back
to
his
chair
a
man
arose
in
the
back
of
the
house
and
began
to
speak
after
a
moment
the
chairman
halted
him
with
a
gesture
it
is
difficult
for
the
comrades
on
this
side
the
hall
to
hear
you
wo
you
come
to
the
platform
the
man
hesitated
then
nodded
his
head
and
with
a
certain
deliberateness
moved
down
the
aisle
and
stepping
upon
the
only
slightly
raised
platform
stood
facing
the
gathering
a
colour
flared
in
his
cheek
and
his
hands
held
somewhat
stiffly
at
his
sides
opened
and
shut
it
was
evident
that
he
was
not
an
accustomed
speaker
and
that
there
was
diffidence
or
doubt
of
himself
and
his
welcome
to
be
overcome
he
began
stammering
with
nervous
hesitation
if
anything
he
say
would
help
by
one
filing
he
would
say
it
though
he
was
used
yet
to
speaking
he
owed
a
debt
and
he
believed
in
paying
debts
though
not
the
way
the
world
made
you
pay
them
it
was
hard
to
tell
how
young
or
old
he
was
at
times
he
looked
boyish
then
when
a
certain
haggard
brooding
aspect
came
upon
him
he
seemed
a
man
his
clothes
were
poor
but
whole
and
clean
his
shirt
a
grey
flannel
one
above
the
loose
collar
showed
a
short
dark
beard
features
and
dark
eyes
lines
came
into
hagar
forehead
between
her
eyes
she
had
seen
this
man
somewhere
where
she
had
a
trick
of
holding
her
mind
passive
when
the
wanted
memory
would
slowly
rise
like
water
from
a
deep
deep
well
now
after
a
minute
or
two
it
came
she
had
seen
him
in
the
that
night
going
from
eglantine
to
see
romeo
and
juliet
he
had
been
in
workman
clothes
he
had
touched
her
skirt
standing
before
her
in
the
car
then
he
had
found
a
seat
and
she
had
watched
him
unfold
and
read
a
newspaper
some
vague
uncertain
thought
that
she
could
not
trace
had
made
her
regard
him
at
intervals
until
with
miss
bedford
and
lily
and
laydon
she
had
left
the
car
the
man
on
the
platform
had
shaken
off
the
initial
clumsiness
of
speech
and
bearing
like
a
swimmer
he
had
needled
the
wave
he
was
not
clumsy
now
he
was
speaking
with
short
stripped
words
nakedly
with
earnestness
at
white
heat
once
he
had
been
dumb
and
angry
he
said
as
a
maddened
dog
he
had
been
through
years
that
had
made
him
so
he
had
been
growing
like
a
wolf
there
were
times
when
he
wanted
to
take
hold
of
the
world
throat
and
tear
it
out
do
you
remember
ishmael
in
the
bible
his
hand
against
every
man
and
every
man
hand
against
him
well
i
was
growing
to
feel
that
way
then
at
that
point
and
that
was
perhaps
three
years
ago
and
i
was
down
south
in
a
town
in
my
state
trying
to
get
work
i
knew
how
to
break
rock
and
i
knew
how
to
make
parts
of
shoes
and
i
did
know
much
besides
except
that
it
was
a
hard
world
and
i
hated
it
at
this
point
chance
or
something
had
sent
him
an
acquaintance
an
educated
man
a
bookkeeper
in
the
concern
where
he
finally
got
a
job
out
of
the
acquaintanceship
had
grown
a
friendship
after
a
while
i
got
to
going
to
his
house
he
had
a
wife
who
helped
him
lots
the
three
used
to
talk
together
and
the
man
lent
him
books
and
made
him
read
them
and
little
by
little
he
led
me
on
he
was
like
an
old
man
i
knew
in
the
mountains
when
i
was
a
boy
he
showed
me
that
we
all
sick
and
sorry
but
that
growing
a
principle
of
health
he
showed
me
how
slow
we
creep
up
from
worm
to
man
and
how
now
we
fluttering
toward
something
farther
on
and
how
hands
of
the
past
come
upon
us
and
how
we
yet
escape
and
the
wings
strengthen
he
showed
me
how
vindictiveness
is
no
use
and
how
much
that
is
wrong
with
the
world
is
owing
to
poor
social
mechanism
and
can
be
changed
he
showed
me
what
brotherliness
means
on
the
road
to
unity
he
put
it
in
my
mind
and
heart
to
want
to
help
he
told
me
i
had
a
good
mind
i
had
always
rather
liked
books
but
i
been
where
i
could
get
any
even
if
they
given
you
time
for
reading
he
made
me
study
things
out
and
one
day
i
began
to
think
think
for
myself
think
it
out
i
never
stopped
usually
now
i
at
nights
i
learning
and
i
going
to
keep
on
until
i
make
thinking
wisdom
he
studied
the
ceiling
a
moment
then
spoke
out
with
a
ring
in
his
voice
i
was
a
mountain
boy
when
i
was
out
of
my
teens
i
got
drunk
at
a
dance
and
played
and
almost
killed
a
man
or
two
then
the
sheriff
chased
me
up
to
catamount
gap
and
the
stuff
was
still
in
me
and
my
head
hitting
the
stars
and
i
shot
and
shot
at
the
sheriff
well
the
end
of
all
that
playing
was
that
i
went
to
the
penitentiary
for
four
years
one
thing
i
want
wisdom
for
is
to
know
how
to
talk
to
people
about
what
is
called
crime
and
about
that
great
crime
our
law
courts
and
penal
system
well
i
came
out
of
the
penitentiary
and
then
it
was
very
hard
to
get
work
it
was
bitter
hard
that
another
thing
i
want
learning
and
wisdom
for
to
talk
about
that
you
see
the
penitentiary
was
content
with
the
four
years
it
followed
me
always
and
then
it
hard
to
get
work
anyhow
there
was
any
use
in
going
back
to
the
mountains
but
after
a
while
i
got
work
and
kept
it
then
three
months
ago
i
came
up
here
and
i
got
work
here
i
working
on
your
streets
now
and
studying
between
times
i
standing
up
here
to
tell
you
that
you
got
a
flag
that
draws
the
unhappy
to
you
when
it
happens
that
seeking
with
the
mind
i
do
know
much
about
we
did
have
it
in
the
mountains
though
of
course
we
had
it
in
the
penitentiary
but
i
know
that
we
got
to
take
the
best
that
was
in
the
past
and
leave
the
worst
and
go
on
with
the
best
toward
new
things
we
got
to
help
others
and
help
ourselves
and
it
does
do
just
to
want
to
help
you
got
to
have
a
working
theory
you
got
to
use
your
mind
you
got
to
consider
your
line
of
march
and
mark
it
out
and
blast
away
the
rock
upon
it
and
go
on
and
i
am
willing
to
be
of
your
construction
gang
the
man
i
was
talking
about
thought
pretty
much
that
way
too
he
said
there
were
a
lot
of
isolated
people
here
there
and
everywhere
not
only
those
that
call
themselves
but
others
too
and
women
just
as
well
as
men
who
were
thinking
that
way
that
they
might
not
call
themselves
socialists
but
that
they
were
blood
kin
just
the
same
i
do
know
why
but
i
am
thinking
of
something
that
happened
when
i
had
been
a
year
in
the
penitentiary
and
they
had
rented
a
lot
of
us
up
the
river
to
make
the
bed
for
a
railroad
while
i
was
up
there
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
and
i
ran
away
they
set
the
dogs
on
my
track
and
took
me
of
course
but
before
they
did
i
was
lying
in
a
thicket
and
i
had
anything
to
eat
for
two
days
and
a
night
a
little
girl
about
twelve
years
old
i
reckon
came
over
a
hill
and
down
to
the
stream
by
the
thicket
she
gathered
flowers
and
set
them
around
a
big
rock
for
a
flower
doll
she
had
two
little
apple
pies
and
she
put
those
in
the
middle
and
then
she
saw
me
lying
in
the
thicket
and
i
was
wearing
the
colour
flared
into
his
face
then
ebbed
i
was
wearing
stripes
i
do
think
she
ever
thought
of
being
frightened
she
gave
me
both
pies
and
she
sat
and
talked
to
me
like
a
friendly
human
being
i
never
forgotten
and
when
the
dogs
came
as
they
did
pretty
soon
and
the
men
behind
them
she
lay
on
the
grass
and
cried
and
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
i
never
forgotten
that
what
i
mean
i
do
care
what
we
done
if
we
not
fiends
incarnate
and
very
few
of
us
are
we
got
to
feel
toward
one
another
like
that
we
got
to
feel
you
are
struck
i
am
struck
if
you
are
wearing
stripes
i
am
wearing
stripes
we
got
to
feel
something
more
than
brotherhood
we
got
to
feel
identity
and
as
a
part
anyway
of
that
road
seems
to
me
to
be
named
socialization
i
willing
to
be
called
a
socialist
he
nodded
to
the
audience
and
stepping
from
the
platform
amid
a
clapping
of
hands
and
stamping
of
feet
did
not
return
to
his
place
in
the
back
of
the
hall
but
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
stage
his
hands
clasped
around
his
knee
a
german
clockmaker
and
a
fiery
dark
woman
spoke
each
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
the
meeting
ended
there
was
a
noise
of
rising
of
pushing
back
chairs
a
surge
of
people
in
part
toward
the
exit
in
part
toward
the
platform
hagar
touched
rachel
on
the
arm
wait
here
for
me
i
want
to
speak
to
that
yes
i
know
him
wait
here
rachel
she
made
her
way
to
the
space
before
the
platform
where
men
and
women
were
pressing
about
the
speakers
the
man
with
the
grey
flannel
shirt
was
answering
a
question
or
two
put
by
the
man
who
had
spoken
first
he
stood
with
a
certain
mountain
litheness
and
lack
of
tension
a
movement
his
answer
given
brought
him
face
to
face
with
hagar
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
so
that
it
might
not
trouble
the
people
behind
her
and
she
had
it
still
in
her
hand
her
dark
soft
hair
framed
her
face
much
as
it
had
done
in
childhood
she
was
looking
at
him
with
wide
startled
eyes
i
had
to
come
to
tell
you
she
said
that
i
am
glad
you
came
through
i
never
forgot
you
either
you
either
the
man
stared
at
her
they
were
apple
turnovers
she
said
but
before
she
had
really
spoken
there
came
the
flush
and
light
of
recognition
oh
h
he
fell
back
a
step
then
with
a
reddened
cheek
and
a
light
in
his
eyes
put
out
his
hand
she
laid
hers
in
it
his
fingers
closed
over
hers
in
a
grasp
strong
enough
to
give
pain
then
as
their
hands
dropped
as
she
fell
back
a
little
the
second
speaker
came
between
then
others
suddenly
the
lights
were
lowered
people
were
staying
too
long
rachel
hand
on
hagar
arm
drew
her
back
come
we
must
go
willy
too
was
insistent
it
getting
late
show
over
the
space
between
her
and
the
boy
of
the
thicket
the
figure
drawn
against
the
sky
of
the
canal
lock
widened
filled
with
forms
in
the
partial
dusk
she
was
by
the
outgoing
stream
through
the
door
out
upon
the
stair
and
so
down
to
the
street
where
now
there
were
fewer
lights
the
wind
had
arisen
and
the
air
turned
colder
we
take
this
car
and
then
the
elevated
and
while
she
was
still
bewildered
they
were
on
the
car
the
bell
clanged
they
went
on
again
in
what
seemed
the
shortest
time
they
were
out
in
the
night
then
climbing
the
long
stairs
then
through
the
gate
and
upon
the
rushing
elevated
willy
talked
and
talked
he
was
excited
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
all
about
bombs
but
they
talked
sense
did
they
and
there
was
something
in
the
air
that
kind
of
warmed
you
next
time
i
in
new
york
i
going
again
look
at
the
lights
streaming
off
by
jiminy
new
york
great
he
was
not
staying
at
the
maines
but
with
other
kinspeople
a
few
blocks
away
he
saw
the
two
in
at
the
door
said
and
went
whistling
away
hagar
and
rachel
turned
off
the
lowered
gas
in
the
hall
and
went
softly
upstairs
as
they
passed
maine
door
she
asked
sleepily
from
within
did
you
enjoy
the
play
we
did
go
said
rachel
we
tell
you
about
it
in
the
morning
when
the
two
had
said
and
parted
and
hagar
in
her
own
room
kneeling
at
the
window
looked
up
at
the
pleiades
at
aldebaran
only
then
came
the
realization
that
she
did
not
know
that
man
name
that
she
had
never
heard
it
in
her
thoughts
he
had
always
been
the
boy
chapter
xviii
a
telegram
the
next
day
she
went
down
to
the
settlement
elizabeth
was
at
home
yes
i
could
give
you
a
list
of
books
on
socialism
i
read
a
good
deal
along
those
lines
myself
i
am
glad
you
are
interested
i
am
interested
answered
hagar
i
can
not
get
any
of
these
books
now
but
i
am
looking
for
fifty
dollars
and
when
it
comes
i
will
but
i
can
lend
you
two
or
three
said
elizabeth
wo
you
take
them
dear
hagar
she
regarded
the
younger
woman
with
her
steady
friendly
eyes
her
strong
lips
just
parting
in
a
smile
there
was
perhaps
nine
difference
in
their
ages
but
mentally
they
came
nearer
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
dropped
the
formal
address
hagar
answered
with
a
warm
colour
and
a
tremulous
light
from
brow
to
chin
yes
if
you
be
so
good
elizabeth
she
crossed
the
floor
with
the
other
to
the
long
low
bookcase
elizabeth
drew
out
a
couple
of
volumes
these
are
good
to
begin
with
and
this
she
stood
a
moment
in
thought
her
back
to
the
case
her
elbow
resting
on
its
polished
top
and
her
head
upon
her
hand
on
a
shelf
behind
her
stood
a
small
bronze
psyche
a
photograph
of
botticelli
judith
a
drawing
of
florence
nightingale
hagar
said
elizabeth
if
i
give
you
two
or
three
books
upon
the
position
of
woman
in
the
past
and
will
you
read
them
i
will
read
anything
you
give
me
elizabeth
she
took
her
parcel
of
books
and
went
back
to
the
maines
she
read
with
great
rapidity
her
memory
was
not
a
verbal
one
but
her
very
tissues
seemed
to
absorb
the
sense
of
what
she
read
much
in
these
books
simply
formulated
for
her
with
clearness
what
was
already
in
solution
in
her
mind
here
and
there
she
was
conscious
of
lines
of
difference
of
inward
criticism
but
in
the
main
they
but
enlarged
a
content
already
there
but
brought
above
the
threshold
named
and
fed
what
she
was
already
thinking
her
mind
went
back
to
eglantine
and
roger
michael
talk
no
it
did
not
begin
even
here
it
was
in
me
it
had
been
in
me
a
long
time
only
i
did
know
it
or
called
it
other
names
before
these
books
were
finished
she
got
her
fifty
dollars
from
the
magazine
and
the
magazine
itself
was
sent
her
with
her
story
in
it
she
sat
and
read
the
story
and
it
seemed
strange
and
new
in
its
robe
of
print
the
magazine
had
provided
an
illustration
and
how
strange
it
was
to
see
her
figures
or
rather
her
figures
moving
and
laughing
there
again
and
again
after
the
first
time
she
opened
the
magazine
and
in
part
or
whole
read
the
story
and
gazed
upon
the
illustration
half
a
dozen
or
more
times
during
the
first
hours
then
with
dwindling
frequency
day
after
day
for
a
week
or
so
after
that
her
appetite
for
her
own
completed
work
flagged
she
laid
the
magazine
away
and
it
was
years
before
she
read
that
story
again
the
fifty
dollars
she
put
away
to
go
toward
her
summer
clothes
and
wrote
to
her
grandmother
that
she
had
done
so
the
remaining
fifteen
she
expended
on
books
taking
starred
titles
from
elizabeth
list
in
january
she
wrote
the
lame
duck
she
sent
it
to
one
of
the
great
monthlies
it
was
accepted
she
was
paid
a
fair
price
and
the
monthly
gave
her
to
understand
that
it
should
like
to
see
next
story
the
letter
came
as
she
was
leaving
the
house
for
a
walk
in
the
park
there
was
no
great
distance
to
go
before
you
came
to
an
entrance
and
she
often
went
alone
and
wandered
here
and
there
by
herself
the
country
was
in
her
veins
not
to
see
trees
and
grass
very
often
was
very
bad
she
opened
the
letter
saw
what
it
was
then
walked
on
in
a
rosy
mist
after
a
while
out
under
the
branched
grey
trees
she
found
a
bench
sat
down
and
read
it
again
and
yet
again
her
soul
passioned
to
do
this
thing
to
write
to
write
well
to
give
out
wonderfully
beautifully
a
letter
that
told
her
it
was
so
that
she
was
doing
that
which
with
the
strongest
longing
she
longed
to
do
must
be
to
her
golden
as
a
love
letter
with
it
open
on
her
lap
with
her
eyes
on
the
serene
meadow
on
the
edge
of
which
she
sat
she
stayed
a
long
time
dreaming
a
young
man
and
woman
lovers
evidently
slowly
passed
her
bench
beneath
the
trees
she
watched
them
with
tranquil
eyes
they
lovers
and
she
felt
a
reflex
of
their
bliss
they
passed
and
she
watched
as
happily
the
grey
spaces
where
a
few
sheep
stirred
and
the
edge
of
trees
beyond
dream
trees
in
the
mist
quite
simply
she
fell
to
thinking
of
the
boy
he
had
been
often
in
her
mind
since
the
evening
of
that
meeting
she
wondered
about
him
a
good
deal
she
did
not
know
his
name
she
had
no
idea
where
he
lived
he
might
be
in
new
york
now
or
he
might
not
be
she
might
pass
him
in
the
street
and
not
know
though
indeed
now
she
kept
a
lookout
he
did
not
know
her
name
she
was
to
him
the
little
girl
as
he
was
to
her
the
boy
they
might
never
meet
again
but
she
had
a
faith
that
it
would
not
be
so
what
she
felt
toward
him
was
but
friendliness
concern
and
some
admiration
but
the
feeling
had
a
soft
glow
and
pulse
the
most
marked
thing
was
the
consciousness
that
she
knew
him
truly
reasoning
did
not
come
into
it
she
could
have
told
herself
a
dozen
times
how
little
she
did
know
and
it
would
have
made
no
difference
it
was
as
though
the
boy
and
she
had
seen
each
essential
self
through
a
clear
pane
of
glass
her
mind
did
not
dwell
long
upon
him
she
sat
with
her
hands
crossed
above
the
letter
and
her
eyes
upon
the
far
horizon
to
write
to
write
to
produce
to
lead
forth
to
give
birth
to
push
out
and
farther
on
forever
to
make
a
beautiful
thing
and
always
a
more
beautiful
thing
always
always
she
was
more
mind
than
body
as
she
sat
there
she
saw
her
going
up
to
heaven
before
her
there
came
an
impulse
to
look
on
beauty
that
other
minds
had
sent
forth
she
rose
and
walked
with
her
light
rhythmic
swiftness
northward
toward
the
metropolitan
when
she
passed
the
turnstile
there
lacked
less
than
an
hour
of
closing
time
she
went
at
once
toward
the
rooms
where
were
the
casts
there
was
hardly
a
moving
figure
besides
herself
there
were
only
the
still
white
giants
she
entered
an
alcove
where
there
was
a
seat
drawn
before
a
cast
of
the
tomb
of
lorenzo
medici
she
sat
down
and
gazed
upon
michael
angelo
thinker
after
a
while
her
eyes
moved
to
the
great
figures
of
twilight
and
dawn
and
then
rising
she
crossed
to
guliano
tomb
and
stood
before
day
and
night
presently
she
left
the
alcove
and
crossing
by
the
models
of
the
parthenon
and
of
notre
dame
came
into
the
hall
of
the
antique
and
into
the
presence
of
the
great
venus
here
she
stayed
until
a
man
came
through
the
place
and
said
it
was
closing
time
in
february
she
sent
to
the
same
monthly
the
mortal
it
passed
from
hand
to
hand
until
in
due
time
it
reached
the
editor
he
read
it
then
strolled
into
the
assistant
editor
room
new
star
in
the
sky
but
before
hagar
could
hear
from
the
monthly
another
moment
in
her
life
was
here
a
week
after
she
had
mailed
this
story
she
and
rachel
were
together
one
evening
in
the
latter
room
it
was
pouring
rain
and
there
would
be
no
company
supper
was
just
over
the
maines
clung
to
supper
and
the
children
had
not
been
put
to
bed
nightgowned
they
made
excursions
and
alarms
from
their
nursery
into
their
mother
room
and
out
again
and
in
again
then
rachel
turned
out
the
gas
and
they
all
sat
in
the
light
of
the
coal
fire
and
first
rachel
told
a
story
and
then
betty
told
one
and
then
hagar
and
then
charley
they
were
all
stories
out
of
mother
goose
so
no
one
had
to
wait
long
for
their
turn
then
hagar
had
to
tell
about
bouncing
bet
and
creeping
charley
which
was
a
continued
story
with
wonderful
adventures
an
adventure
a
night
then
the
clock
struck
eight
with
a
leaden
sound
and
mammy
appeared
in
the
nursery
door
you
carry
me
cried
bouncing
bet
and
you
carry
me
cried
creeping
charley
so
rachel
took
one
and
hagar
took
the
other
mounted
them
like
papooses
and
in
the
nursery
shot
each
into
the
appropriate
small
white
bed
back
before
the
fire
with
the
lights
still
out
the
two
sat
for
a
time
in
silence
hagar
had
a
story
in
mind
she
was
musing
it
out
seeing
the
figures
come
true
in
the
lit
hollows
rachel
had
a
habit
of
crooning
to
herself
she
went
on
now
with
one
of
the
rhymes
baa
baa
black
sheep
have
you
any
wool
yes
sir
yes
sir
three
bags
full
one
for
my
master
and
one
for
my
dame
and
one
for
the
little
boy
that
lives
in
the
lane
hagar
stirred
lifted
her
arms
and
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
head
how
the
rain
pours
the
winter
is
nearly
over
it
has
been
a
wonderful
winter
i
glad
you
found
it
so
said
rachel
you
got
a
of
your
own
behind
your
eyes
everything
spins
out
for
good
for
you
sooner
or
later
and
somehow
or
other
you
lucky
are
you
lucky
too
have
you
liked
this
winter
oh
i
liked
it
i
liked
you
rachel
i
wish
you
be
happy
you
got
those
darling
children
i
am
happy
where
the
children
touch
and
oh
yes
they
touch
a
long
way
round
but
there
a
gap
in
the
circle
where
you
go
out
lonely
and
come
in
lonely
that
true
of
everybody
circle
mine
yours
everybody
but
you
chafe
so
you
blow
the
coals
with
your
breath
i
do
need
to
blow
the
coal
it
burns
without
that
let
me
tell
you
hagar
there
are
two
kinds
of
people
in
the
world
the
people
who
are
half
or
maybe
two
thirds
the
way
out
of
the
pit
and
the
mire
and
the
slough
and
the
shadow
so
thick
you
can
cut
it
they
are
rising
still
and
their
garments
are
getting
clean
and
white
and
they
can
see
the
wonderful
round
landscape
and
they
look
at
it
with
calm
wide
eyes
they
nearly
out
they
more
or
less
spectators
the
other
kind
they
the
poor
dull
infuriated
actors
they
still
in
they
can
hardly
see
even
the
rim
of
the
pit
the
first
kind
wants
to
help
and
does
help
it
willing
for
the
others
to
lay
hold
of
its
hands
its
skirts
to
drag
out
by
it
willing
as
an
angel
and
often
the
others
would
get
out
at
all
if
it
did
give
aid
but
it
seen
of
course
and
it
away
beyond
people
like
elizabeth
eden
for
instance
but
the
other
kind
my
it
all
personal
with
us
yet
we
fighting
and
loving
and
hating
down
here
in
the
muck
and
turmoil
all
of
us
who
are
yet
devils
and
those
who
are
and
those
of
us
who
are
just
getting
vision
and
finding
the
the
animal
and
the
and
those
only
got
pointed
ears
all
resenting
and
striking
out
and
trampling
one
another
knowing
some
of
us
that
there
are
better
things
and
yet
not
knowing
how
to
get
the
shining
garments
others
not
caring
oh
i
tell
you
life
a
bubbling
cauldron
i
know
it
is
deep
above
and
deep
below
but
rachel
rose
went
to
the
window
and
stood
brow
against
the
pane
looking
out
the
rain
dashed
against
the
glass
all
the
street
lights
were
blurred
the
gusty
wind
shook
the
bare
boughs
of
the
one
tree
upon
the
block
you
do
know
anything
about
my
married
life
well
going
to
tell
you
she
came
back
to
the
fire
pushed
a
footstool
upon
the
hearth
and
sat
down
crouching
close
to
the
flame
i
not
yet
i
was
married
to
julian
bolt
when
i
was
eighteen
i
known
him
or
i
thought
i
known
him
for
years
his
mother
and
sisters
went
in
summer
to
the
place
in
the
mountains
where
we
always
went
they
had
money
though
less
than
people
supposed
julian
spent
two
weeks
with
them
each
summer
he
was
older
than
i
of
course
years
older
but
he
used
to
row
us
girls
upon
the
lake
and
to
play
tennis
with
us
and
we
thought
him
wonderful
we
called
him
prince
as
i
got
older
he
rowed
me
sometimes
alone
on
the
lake
and
now
and
then
we
went
for
a
walk
together
he
was
and
he
dressed
and
talked
well
and
he
spent
money
i
had
heard
somebody
call
him
but
i
did
know
what
meant
there
were
two
or
three
families
in
the
place
with
daughters
out
or
about
to
come
out
and
they
made
julian
bolt
very
welcome
i
never
heard
a
father
or
mother
there
say
a
word
against
him
mine
did
well
i
came
out
very
early
and
the
summer
after
when
i
went
to
virginia
to
the
white
with
my
aunt
and
that
winter
when
i
stayed
with
some
army
people
at
old
point
he
came
to
both
places
and
i
knew
that
he
came
to
see
me
he
told
me
so
of
course
though
i
would
have
died
rather
than
say
it
even
to
myself
of
course
i
was
expecting
men
to
fall
in
love
with
me
and
ask
me
to
marry
them
and
expecting
to
choose
one
having
first
of
course
fallen
in
love
with
him
and
be
married
in
white
satin
and
old
lace
and
be
romantically
happy
and
provided
for
ever
after
is
that
the
thinking
r√¥le
for
every
properly
girl
the
funny
thing
is
that
i
rather
die
than
see
betty
come
upon
that
treadmill
they
built
for
a
girl
mind
well
i
was
on
it
all
right
julian
had
money
and
he
spent
it
recklessly
i
did
see
how
recklessly
i
did
see
anything
except
that
he
liked
me
for
he
sent
me
the
most
beautiful
flowers
the
most
expensive
and
books
and
magazines
it
was
a
gay
winter
looking
back
it
seems
to
me
that
everybody
was
eating
and
drinking
for
we
die
i
knew
i
must
fall
in
love
that
had
been
suggested
to
me
suggested
for
years
just
as
regularly
and
powerfully
as
any
hypnotist
could
do
it
the
whole
world
was
bent
on
suggesting
it
to
every
young
girl
you
see
the
world
selfish
it
wants
to
live
and
it
ca
live
unless
the
young
girl
says
yea
and
it
ca
leave
it
or
it
thinks
it
ca
to
nature
working
in
a
certain
number
in
her
own
good
time
it
must
cheat
and
beguile
and
train
the
girl
every
girl
every
girl
i
tell
you
i
did
know
any
more
about
marriage
than
i
did
about
life
on
the
planet
mars
i
was
packing
my
trunks
for
a
voyage
and
i
did
know
where
i
was
going
i
did
know
anything
about
it
no
one
offered
me
a
baedeker
it
was
orange
blossoms
and
a
veil
and
a
ring
and
i
did
know
what
either
meant
and
felicitations
and
presents
and
the
golden
and
lived
happily
ever
after
julian
was
handsome
and
lavish
and
popular
and
his
family
were
all
right
and
if
he
had
been
gay
he
would
now
settle
down
and
father
and
mother
were
satisfied
and
people
said
i
was
to
be
envied
i
married
at
eighteen
i
had
read
much
i
did
know
anything
no
one
told
me
anything
maybe
the
world
thinks
that
if
it
tells
the
young
girl
would
say
no
we
went
on
a
i
suppose
sometimes
a
is
a
mockery
i
not
so
bitter
as
not
to
know
that
often
it
is
so
that
often
it
is
all
right
i
not
denying
love
and
clean
men
and
considerate
i
not
denying
hosts
of
marriages
that
without
any
very
high
ideal
are
fit
and
decent
enough
i
not
denying
noble
lovers
men
and
women
and
noble
marriages
i
only
saying
that
the
other
kind
the
kind
that
not
fit
nor
clean
nor
decent
and
anything
but
noble
is
so
frequent
and
commonplace
that
it
is
rather
laughable
and
altogether
sardonic
and
devilish
to
kneel
down
and
worship
as
we
do
the
institution
of
staying
together
staying
together
at
any
price
even
when
evidently
the
only
clean
thing
to
do
would
be
to
stay
apart
my
lasted
four
months
i
went
eighteen
and
i
came
back
old
as
i
am
now
older
than
i
am
now
for
i
have
grown
younger
these
last
two
years
my
marriage
was
the
noble
kind
it
was
the
kind
you
could
make
noble
it
was
even
the
decent
type
it
was
a
sink
and
a
pit
and
a
horror
she
bent
and
stirred
the
fire
outside
the
gusty
wind
went
by
and
the
rain
beat
upon
the
windows
i
know
that
there
are
marriages
where
woman
is
the
ruiner
there
are
women
who
are
wreckers
they
fasten
themselves
on
a
man
life
and
drain
it
dry
they
are
they
hold
him
in
their
arms
and
break
his
bones
they
among
the
worst
of
us
struggling
here
in
the
pit
they
wicked
women
they
may
be
fewer
than
wicked
men
or
they
may
be
equal
in
number
i
do
know
i
not
talking
of
wicked
men
or
wicked
women
in
that
sense
i
talking
of
men
whom
the
world
does
not
call
wicked
and
of
a
great
army
of
women
like
myself
an
army
that
stretches
round
the
world
and
through
hundreds
of
years
an
army
it
is
an
army
we
never
had
any
weapons
we
were
never
taught
to
fight
we
were
never
allowed
to
ask
questions
we
were
told
there
were
no
questions
to
ask
we
were
young
girls
dreaming
dropped
into
the
wolf
pack
and
it
goes
on
all
the
time
it
is
going
on
now
it
may
be
going
on
when
betty
grows
up
though
i
tell
her
you
need
be
afraid
i
tell
her
that
wedding
trip
that
honeymoon
i
had
married
a
handsome
beast
a
cruel
one
too
he
treated
me
like
a
slave
bought
for
one
purpose
wanted
for
one
purpose
kept
for
one
purpose
i
was
enough
for
him
i
found
that
out
very
soon
but
those
others
were
freer
than
i
they
made
him
pay
them
he
would
have
said
that
he
paid
me
too
that
he
supported
me
perhaps
it
true
i
only
know
that
i
am
going
to
have
betty
taught
to
support
herself
you
should
have
left
him
we
were
in
europe
i
had
any
money
i
was
beaten
down
and
stunned
when
i
tried
to
write
to
father
and
mother
i
could
they
would
have
said
that
i
was
hysterical
and
for
god
sake
to
consider
the
family
name
i
have
been
a
woman
slow
to
develop
mentally
what
poise
got
what
reading
what
knowledge
what
everything
has
come
to
me
since
that
time
then
i
did
know
how
to
hold
my
head
up
and
march
out
then
i
only
wanted
to
die
we
came
home
and
it
was
to
find
father
with
a
desperate
illness
i
could
tell
mother
then
i
doubt
if
i
could
ever
have
told
her
i
doubt
if
it
would
have
done
any
good
if
i
had
we
went
to
live
in
a
house
up
on
the
sound
julian
said
his
fortune
was
getting
low
and
that
it
would
be
cheaper
there
but
he
himself
came
into
town
and
stayed
when
he
wished
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
i
do
not
know
what
he
did
with
it
he
threw
away
all
that
he
had
i
knew
by
now
that
betty
was
coming
she
was
born
before
i
was
nineteen
and
charley
was
born
a
year
afterward
born
blind
and
i
knew
why
i
loved
my
children
but
my
marriage
remained
what
it
had
always
been
when
charley
was
nearly
a
year
old
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
if
i
could
stand
it
for
myself
i
saw
that
i
could
stand
it
for
them
i
could
let
them
grow
up
having
that
kind
of
a
mother
the
kind
that
would
stand
it
julian
went
away
every
two
or
three
months
he
took
all
the
money
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
and
disappeared
i
knew
that
he
had
dived
into
all
that
goes
on
here
in
some
places
in
this
city
he
would
be
gone
sometimes
two
weeks
sometimes
longer
well
this
time
i
took
betty
and
charley
and
came
home
came
here
and
they
tried
to
persuade
me
to
go
back
the
bishop
was
here
visiting
his
nephew
and
he
came
and
tried
to
persuade
me
to
go
back
but
i
and
there
was
no
need
within
the
week
julian
was
killed
in
a
fray
in
a
house
a
mile
i
suppose
from
where
we
sit
that
was
two
years
ago
she
rose
and
moved
about
the
firelit
room
yes
i
got
the
two
children
and
life
healing
over
i
do
call
myself
unhappy
now
at
times
i
quite
gay
and
you
do
know
how
eerie
it
feels
but
happy
or
not
hagar
i
never
forget
i
never
forget
i
never
forget
they
talk
about
the
end
of
the
century
and
about
our
seeing
the
beginning
of
better
things
they
say
the
twentieth
century
will
be
an
age
of
clearer
thinking
and
greater
courage
and
they
talk
about
the
coming
great
there
one
movement
that
i
want
to
see
and
that
the
movement
to
tell
the
young
girl
if
i
were
the
world
i
would
have
my
dishonoured
life
as
it
gets
it
now
and
now
talk
about
something
else
hagar
crossed
to
her
took
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
lips
and
forehead
i
love

rachel

at

and
the
glistening
asphalt

doorbell

she
struck
a
match
and

the

hagar

not

hagar

still
delirious

doctor

that
he
is

i

time

colonel

i
have
known

pretty
badly
knocked
to
what

thomson
moved
to
the
bell
and
gave
the
order
to
the
arab
who
appeared
with
the
swiftness
of
a
genie
is
there
anything
else
sir
no
not
now
the
english
papers
are
upon
the
small
table
sir
and
thomson
glided
from
the
room
the
colonel
looked
about
him
humph
millionaires
fix
themselves
luxuriously
i
keep
seeing
her
said
hagar
her
body
lying
drowned
there
the
colonel
glanced
at
her
pull
yourself
together
gipsy
whatever
you
do
do
get
morbid
i
wo
hagar
answered
i
like
you
there
grandfather
i
hate
it
but
it
is
morbidness
to
think
a
little
of
her
the
arab
brought
the
coffee
turkish
coffee
said
the
colonel
not
without
relish
in
his
voice
i
always
wanted
to
taste
he
did
so
appreciatively
ah
it
good
he
leaned
back
in
the
deep
wicker
chair
and
gazed
upon
the
latest
attendant
and
what
may
be
your
name
the
figure
spread
its
hands
and
said
something
unintelligible
humph
comment
vous
mahomet
monsieur
we
come
gipsy
said
the
colonel
far
from
old
virginia
well
i
always
wanted
to
travel
but
i
never
could
i
had
a
sense
of
responsibility
it
struck
hagar
with
the
force
of
novelty
that
what
he
said
was
true
he
had
such
a
sense
there
had
always
been
times
when
she
did
not
like
her
grandfather
and
times
when
she
did
but
during
the
last
two
weeks
filled
with
a
certain
loneliness
and
strangeness
for
them
both
she
had
felt
nearer
to
him
than
ever
before
there
had
chanced
to
be
on
the
boat
few
people
whom
he
found
congenial
he
had
been
forced
to
fall
back
upon
his
granddaughter
companionship
and
in
doing
so
he
had
made
the
discovery
that
the
child
had
a
mind
he
liked
mind
of
old
when
he
was
most
sarcastically
harsh
toward
maria
he
had
yet
grudgingly
admitted
that
she
had
mind
only
which
was
the
deep
damnation
she
used
it
so
wrongheadedly
but
gipsy
gipsy
have
those
notions
the
laydon
matter
had
been
just
a
foolish
affair
she
had
been
obstinate
but
she
had
seen
her
mistake
as
for
ralph
ralph
would
get
her
yet
the
colonel
had
been
careful
in
their
intercourse
during
the
voyage
to
bring
forward
none
of
her
notions
he
found
that
she
knew
really
an
amazing
amount
of
geography
and
history
that
to
a
certain
extent
she
followed
public
events
that
she
knew
byron
and
could
quote
milton
and
that
though
she
had
no
greek
he
had
forgotten
most
of
his
she
was
familiar
with
translations
and
could
not
only
give
a
connected
account
of
the
olympian
family
but
could
follow
in
their
windings
the
minor
myths
the
long
voyage
the
hours
when
they
reclined
side
by
side
in
their
steamer
chairs
or
with
the
country
need
for
exercise
paced
from
prow
to
stern
and
from
stern
to
prow
taught
him
more
about
his
granddaughter
than
had
done
the
years
at
gilead
balm
she
told
him
of
the
acceptance
of
the
lame
duck
and
the
sending
of
the
mortal
and
he
was
indulgent
toward
her
prospects
there
have
been
women
who
have
done
very
good
work
of
a
certain
type
it
limited
but
it
good
of
its
kind
as
they
have
always
excelled
of
course
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
write
and
in
the
old
south
at
least
we
always
rather
deprecated
that
kind
of
thing
for
a
woman
the
colonel
drank
his
thick
coffee
from
its
little
metal
cup
with
undeniable
and
undenied
pleasure
he
was
not
hypocritical
and
he
never
canted
his
only
son
lay
in
a
large
bedroom
of
this
luxurious
suite
maimed
and
hardly
conscious
and
whether
he
would
live
or
die
no
one
knew
but
the
colonel
had
never
wept
over
medway
in
the
past
and
he
was
not
going
to
weep
now
he
drank
his
coffee
leisurely
and
when
it
was
done
mahomet
took
salver
and
cup
away
rising
the
colonel
walked
to
one
of
the
windows
and
stood
looking
out
at
a
wall
a
shaggy
eucalyptus
tree
and
a
seated
beggar
fearful
to
the
eye
it
was
afternoon
and
they
had
been
in
alexandria
since
eight
i
sent
a
cable
to
your
grandmother
the
doctors
think
holding
his
own
but
i
do
know
it
looks
pretty
bad
they
got
a
nurse
from
a
hospital
here
two
in
fact
and
that
man
thomson
is
invaluable
i
seen
too
this
morning
before
they
let
me
into
the
room
his
wife
brother
it
seems
that
he
was
in
london
at
the
time
and
came
on
and
has
very
properly
waited
here
for
our
arrival
we
walked
through
the
place
mahomet
ali
and
he
took
me
to
a
very
good
club
where
we
sat
and
talked
her
will
it
rather
curious
i
suppose
medway
if
he
lives
will
be
disappointed
and
yet
with
care
he
have
enough
the
colonel
laughed
rather
grimly
think
in
virginia
that
a
million
was
a
good
livelihood
but
standards
are
changing
and
doubtless
he
been
feeling
many
times
that
amount
between
his
fingers
it
occurred
to
me
that
they
must
have
quarrelled
it
like
a
woman
to
fling
off
and
do
a
thing
like
that
hastily
her
brother
says
however
that
he
believes
they
were
really
happy
together
he
fancies
that
she
had
some
feminine
scruple
or
other
as
to
the
way
her
first
husband
obtained
his
wealth
as
the
world
goes
entirely
honourable
transactions
i
believe
and
that
she
had
an
idea
of
it
she
made
this
last
will
in
london
just
before
they
started
on
this
long
trip
that
ended
so
it
been
read
there
a
string
of
bequests
to
servants
and
so
on
she
leaves
just
one
million
well
invested
to
medway
the
rest
and
it
an
enormous
rest
goes
into
a
fund
for
erecting
model
and
workmen
dwellings
philanthropy
mad
said
the
colonel
her
brother
got
i
understand
some
millions
of
his
own
and
he
could
afford
to
smile
also
he
been
supposing
for
a
year
that
it
would
all
go
to
medway
well
that
where
medway
is
if
he
lives
fifty
thousand
or
so
a
year
said
the
colonel
regarding
the
beggar
is
not
an
income
to
be
despised
i
should
be
happy
if
i
saw
each
year
in
clear
money
an
eighth
as
much
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
physician
entered
he
was
an
american
a
young
man
with
an
air
of
strength
and
capability
he
had
lunched
with
the
two
ashendynes
and
now
came
in
as
one
at
home
he
looked
graver
now
than
then
there
was
a
plain
cloud
upon
his
brow
i
do
believe
he
can
hold
out
he
said
abruptly
he
has
a
magnificent
constitution
and
his
body
is
making
a
splendid
fight
but
it
may
come
at
any
minute
with
a
quick
collapse
of
course
i
not
saying
that
it
will
be
so
but
if
miss
ashendyne
wishes
to
see
him
or
to
be
with
him
if
it
should
happen
to
be
the
end
hagar
turned
deadly
pale
the
colonel
not
usually
considerate
of
her
or
given
to
thinking
that
she
needed
consideration
was
somehow
different
if
you
rather
not
gipsy
indeed
i
think
that
you
had
better
not
it
is
as
though
you
had
been
always
with
him
he
turned
to
the
physician
she
has
seen
very
little
of
her
father
since
but
hagar
had
steadied
herself
and
risen
from
her
chair
thank
you
grandfather
but
i
would
rather
go
with
you
it
was
almost
sunset
and
the
splendid
western
light
flooded
the
chamber
where
the
sick
man
lay
he
lay
low
upon
the
pillows
with
only
a
light
covering
there
had
been
beside
injuries
to
spine
and
limb
and
some
internal
hurt
a
bad
blow
over
the
head
this
was
bandaged
fold
after
fold
of
gauze
wrapped
around
forehead
and
crown
oh
thought
hagar
it
is
like
the
white
helmet
in
that
dream
but
the
features
below
were
not
flushed
with
health
they
were
grey
and
drawn
the
second
physician
standing
at
the
lifted
his
hand
from
the
pulse
and
moved
to
the
side
of
the
first
a
little
stronger
the
nurse
placed
a
chair
for
hagar
thomson
at
the
windows
raised
the
jalousies
higher
and
the
light
evening
breeze
blew
through
the
room
it
may
or
it
may
not
be
said
the
first
doctor
in
a
low
voice
to
the
colonel
if
he
pulls
through
i
say
he
wins
the
amber
almost
red
light
of
the
sun
bathed
the
bed
when
the
sun
sank
a
violet
light
covered
it
when
the
short
twilight
was
gone
and
the
large
mild
stars
shone
out
they
brought
shaded
lamps
and
the
bed
lay
half
in
that
light
and
half
in
the
shadow
in
the
room
through
the
slow
passing
hours
hushed
infrequent
movements
took
place
the
doctors
relieving
each
other
in
the
watch
by
the
bed
the
night
nurse
arriving
the
giving
of
stimulants
whispered
consultations
by
the
window
the
adjoining
room
was
prepared
for
rest
and
relaxation
there
was
a
table
with
bread
and
cold
meat
and
wine
the
colonel
came
and
went
noiseless
as
a
shadow
but
a
restless
shadow
once
or
twice
during
the
night
his
touch
upon
her
shoulder
or
his
hand
beckoning
from
the
doorway
drew
hagar
forth
you
better
rest
child
here
drink
this
wine
each
time
she
stayed
half
an
hour
or
so
either
in
the
room
or
out
upon
the
balcony
which
gave
upon
a
garden
but
then
she
stole
back
into
the
bedroom
she
sat
in
a
big
chair
which
she
had
drawn
aside
and
out
of
the
way
she
could
however
see
the
bed
and
the
figure
upon
it
not
clearly
because
the
lights
were
low
but
dimly
she
rather
felt
than
saw
it
it
was
as
though
a
sixth
sense
were
busy
she
sat
very
still
her
father
through
her
mind
automatically
without
any
conscious
willing
drifted
words
and
images
that
spoke
of
father
and
child
it
might
be
a
bible
verse
it
might
be
a
line
from
a
younger
poet
it
might
be
an
image
from
some
story
or
history
father
and
child
father
and
daughter
father
and
daughter
to
sit
and
see
her
father
die
and
to
feel
no
deep
sorrow
no
rending
sense
of
companionship
departing
no
abject
suffocating
pulsing
of
a
stricken
heart
no
lifted
hope
and
faith
or
terror
for
him
no
transcending
sense
of
while
the
loved
one
flew
farther
and
swifter
and
higher
out
of
her
sight
away
from
this
life
low
level
she
could
not
feel
any
of
that
as
little
as
the
colonel
did
she
believe
in
or
practise
cant
she
knew
that
she
could
not
feel
it
thus
and
knew
why
but
there
was
a
great
forlornness
in
sitting
there
and
watching
this
stranger
die
she
tried
to
strengthen
the
faint
memories
that
the
past
held
was
she
five
or
six
years
old
the
last
time
she
had
seen
him
the
distinctest
image
was
of
underneath
the
cedars
at
gilead
balm
there
was
a
shawl
spread
upon
the
grass
her
father
was
lying
on
it
his
hat
tilted
over
his
eyes
there
was
a
book
beside
him
she
had
been
gathering
dandelions
and
she
came
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
shawl
and
opened
the
book
she
thought
every
book
had
pictures
but
there
were
none
in
that
one
then
he
had
waked
up
and
laughed
at
her
and
said
come
here
it
flashed
into
her
consciousness
from
where
it
had
lain
unrecalled
all
these
years
just
what
he
had
said
he
had
said
come
here
miss
ugly
name
she
had
gone
and
in
playing
with
her
he
had
accidentally
burned
her
finger
with
his
lighted
cigar
and
then
it
came
to
her
with
an
effect
of
warmth
and
sunshine
and
with
a
feeling
of
wanting
to
laugh
with
tears
in
her
eyes
he
had
been
beautifully
charmingly
shocked
and
apologetic
he
had
taken
her
away
and
made
old
miss
bandage
the
finger
and
then
he
had
shouldered
her
and
carried
her
into
the
orchard
and
broken
boughs
of
apple
blossoms
for
her
and
told
her
jack
and
the
beanstalk
that
was
almost
all
she
could
remember
or
if
there
were
one
or
two
less
agreeable
things
she
would
not
remember
those
now
she
tried
to
keep
the
warmth
about
her
heart
on
the
whole
aided
by
human
pity
for
the
broken
form
upon
the
bed
she
succeeded
better
than
she
could
have
dreamed
the
man
upon
the
bed
outside
the
fatherhood
outside
the
physical
relation
between
them
there
he
was
a
human
being
with
death
hovering
above
it
was
easier
to
think
of
him
just
as
a
she
laid
hold
of
that
thought
and
kept
it
a
a
with
a
strange
sense
of
relief
she
let
the
images
and
words
and
the
painful
straining
for
some
filial
feeling
pass
from
her
soul
she
did
not
know
why
she
should
feel
toward
him
filially
he
had
not
like
her
mother
suffered
to
give
her
life
he
had
probably
never
thought
of
her
she
had
not
been
to
him
the
concern
in
the
matter
nor
hardly
since
had
he
acted
parentally
toward
her
with
a
wry
humour
she
had
to
concede
the
winter
in
new
york
the
summer
at
the
new
springs
but
it
hardly
seemed
that
the
sacrifice
could
have
been
great
or
that
the
need
for
gratitude
was
extreme
her
soul
rose
against
any
hypocrisy
she
could
not
and
she
would
not
try
to
say
dear
father
dear
father
the
vision
of
her
mother
rose
beside
her
but
just
to
think
of
him
as
a
human
being
she
could
do
that
a
man
lying
there
on
the
knife
edge
of
the
present
with
the
vast
unplumbed
gulf
before
him
that
dream
of
the
blue
sea
and
the
palm
trees
and
the
low
houses
returned
to
mind
but
she
put
it
from
her
somewhat
shudderingly
he
had
looked
so
abounding
in
life
so
vivid
and
vital
with
the
white
hat
like
a
helmet
a
lying
there
helpless
and
suffering
at
three
in
the
morning
the
physician
in
charge
who
had
been
sitting
for
some
time
beside
the
bed
rose
and
moved
away
he
nodded
his
head
to
his
fellow
hagar
caught
the
satisfaction
in
the
gesture
even
before
in
passing
her
chair
he
paused
to
say
just
audibly
i
think
your
father
will
recover
a
short
time
passed
and
then
the
colonel
touched
her
arm
they
think
it
safe
for
us
to
go
he
is
stronger
come
they
call
if
there
is
any
need
but
they
do
think
there
will
be
going
she
stopped
for
a
moment
close
beside
the
bed
she
had
not
been
this
near
before
medway
lay
there
with
his
head
swathed
in
bandages
with
his
lips
and
chin
unshorn
with
no
colour
now
in
his
cheeks
with
his
eyes
closed
hagar
felt
the
sudden
smart
of
tears
between
her
own
lids
the
gold
thread
of
the
dandelion
day
tied
itself
to
the
natural
human
pity
and
awe
her
lips
trembled
father
she
said
in
the
lowest
of
whispers
her
hand
moved
falteringly
until
for
the
lightest
moment
it
rested
upon
his
in
the
outer
room
the
physician
joined
them
he
still
have
to
fight
for
it
and
there
may
be
setbacks
it
going
to
be
a
weary
long
painful
siege
for
him
but
i
do
believe
he
going
to
die
indeed
i
think
that
except
in
the
one
respect
we
get
him
back
to
being
a
well
man
with
a
long
life
before
him
and
that
respect
i
afraid
colonel
ashendyne
that
he
never
walk
again
if
he
does
it
will
be
with
crutches
and
with
great
difficulty
when
half
an
hour
later
hagar
opened
the
door
of
her
own
room
the
dawn
was
coming
it
was
a
comfortable
bedroom
large
cool
and
and
it
too
had
a
balcony
the
bed
invited
she
was
deadly
tired
and
yet
she
doubted
if
she
could
sleep
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
hands
over
her
eyes
then
a
little
stumblingly
she
went
out
upon
the
balcony
it
was
a
small
place
commanding
the
east
there
was
a
chair
and
a
little
table
on
which
you
could
rest
your
arms
and
your
head
upon
them
sideways
so
that
you
could
see
the
sky
it
was
just
grey
light
there
were
three
palm
trees
rustling
rustling
after
a
while
purple
came
into
the
sky
and
then
pale
pale
gold
the
wind
fell
the
palms
stood
still
the
gold
widened
until
all
the
east
was
gold
she
saw
distant
strange
flat
roofs
a
distant
dome
and
slender
towers
all
against
the
pale
pale
gold
the
air
was
cool
and
unearthly
still
her
head
upon
her
arm
her
face
very
quiet
her
eyes
open
upon
the
deepening
light
she
stayed
until
the
gardeners
came
into
the
garden
below
chapter
xx
medway
five
days
later
medway
one
morning
recognized
the
colonel
why
my
dear
father
what
are
you
doing
here
what
it
all
about
his
feeble
voice
died
away
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
lapsed
into
a
kind
of
out
of
this
day
by
day
though
he
came
more
strongly
directly
he
appeared
to
accept
without
further
curiosity
his
father
occasional
presence
in
the
room
another
interval
and
he
began
to
question
the
physician
and
nurses
back
eh
and
leg
and
this
thing
on
my
head
i
do
a
kind
of
crash
what
happened
evasive
answers
did
for
a
while
but
it
was
evident
that
they
would
not
do
for
ever
in
the
end
it
was
thomson
who
told
him
you
did
did
you
exclaimed
the
doctor
in
the
outer
room
well
i
do
know
but
what
it
just
as
well
i
could
help
it
sir
he
pinned
me
down
the
colonel
spoke
just
what
and
how
much
did
you
tell
him
i
told
him
sir
about
the
wreck
and
how
he
got
beaten
about
and
how
i
fastened
him
when
he
was
senseless
and
we
were
sinking
to
a
bit
of
spar
and
how
we
were
picked
up
with
some
of
the
crew
about
dawn
and
about
his
being
brought
here
and
being
very
well
cared
for
and
your
coming
from
new
york
you
and
miss
ashendyne
and
that
he
been
wonderful
close
to
dying
but
was
all
right
now
and
what
the
date
was
and
things
like
that
sir
did
he
ask
for
his
wife
yes
sir
and
you
told
him
yes
sir
the
doctor
rose
well
i
glad
it
done
i
go
see
and
disappeared
into
the
i
think
you
did
well
thomson
said
the
colonel
when
you
got
to
take
a
thing
you
better
stand
up
and
take
it
and
the
quicker
the
better
yes
sir
said
thomson
and
adjusted
the
jalousies
it
being
now
very
warm
and
the
glare
at
times
insupportable
the
colonel
under
the
guidance
of
a
dragoman
of
the
best
had
been
shopping
and
was
in
white
duck
hagar
too
had
secured
from
a
french
shop
muslin
and
nainsook
thomson
had
been
concerned
for
her
lack
of
any
maid
or
female
companionship
he
had
gently
broached
the
subject
a
week
or
two
before
ashendyne
had
an
excellent
maid
miss
who
was
with
us
on
the
yacht
that
night
and
was
saved
but
she
of
a
nature
and
the
shock
and
cold
and
everything
rather
laid
her
up
she
has
a
brother
who
is
a
photographer
in
cairo
having
married
a
native
woman
and
she
gone
to
stay
with
him
awhile
before
she
goes
back
into
service
if
that
had
been
the
case
miss
you
might
if
you
wished
have
taken
her
on
i
think
she
would
have
given
satisfaction
as
it
is
miss
i
know
some
english
people
with
a
shop
here
and
i
think
through
them
i
could
find
you
some
one
she
would
not
be
a
superior
lady
maid
like
c√©cile
but
hagar
had
declined
the
offer
i
never
had
a
maid
thank
you
thomson
i
can
do
for
myself
very
well
she
liked
thomson
and
thomson
agreed
with
the
nurse
that
she
was
a
considerate
young
lady
now
having
adjusted
the
blinds
thomson
left
the
room
the
colonel
paced
up
and
down
his
hands
behind
him
the
white
duck
was
becoming
he
did
not
look
sixty
hair
mustache
and
imperial
were
quite
grey
except
for
that
he
had
never
aged
to
hagar
eyes
his
body
had
the
same
height
and
swing
the
same
fine
spareness
his
voice
kept
the
same
rich
inflections
all
the
way
from
mellow
and
golden
to
the
most
corroding
acid
he
dominated
just
as
she
remembered
him
in
her
childhood
not
all
of
his
two
weeks
in
egypt
had
been
spent
by
bedside
he
had
been
fairly
over
alexandria
and
to
meks
and
ramleh
and
even
afield
to
ab√ªkir
and
rosetta
he
had
offered
to
take
her
with
him
upon
these
later
excursions
but
she
had
refused
the
brother
of
her
father
wife
was
going
with
him
and
she
correctly
thought
that
they
would
be
freer
without
her
the
colonel
acquiesced
i
dare
say
you
have
chances
enough
to
see
things
gipsy
it
was
her
first
intimation
that
any
one
had
in
mind
her
staying
now
the
colonel
after
pacing
awhile
spoke
reflectively
at
this
rate
it
wo
be
long
before
he
really
well
enough
to
talk
i
have
to
have
several
talks
with
him
did
you
gather
gipsy
that
thomson
had
told
him
that
he
would
remain
crippled
i
do
not
think
he
told
him
that
grandfather
that
going
to
be
the
shock
said
the
colonel
well
he
have
to
be
told
i
think
thomson
or
the
doctor
had
better
do
it
and
then
he
have
to
learn
about
that
will
altogether
it
may
delay
his
convalescence
a
little
of
course
i
stay
until
he
practically
recovered
as
far
as
he
can
recover
do
you
think
that
perhaps
he
might
like
to
go
home
to
go
home
to
gilead
balm
not
answered
the
colonel
if
i
know
medway
and
i
think
i
do
to
come
back
crippled
after
all
these
primrose
years
to
sleep
in
his
old
room
and
maria
to
sit
on
the
porch
and
listen
to
bob
and
serena
no
that
night
in
her
own
room
hagar
placed
two
candles
on
the
table
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pencil
and
sitting
down
made
a
calculation
the
night
was
warm
to
oppression
through
the
windows
came
the
indefinite
hot
thick
murmur
of
the
evening
city
hagar
sat
with
bare
arms
and
throat
and
loosened
hair
she
wrote
her
name
and
her
age
and
then
an
inch
below
a
little
table
the
prize
story
books
thomasine
all
the
story
in
magazine
books
all
the
lame
duck
have
most
of
it
the
mortal
total
after
a
pause
the
pencil
moved
on
many
stories
in
mind
one
partly
written
the
monthly
says
i
can
write
and
will
make
a
name
it
paused
then
moved
again
to
earn
a
living
to
live
where
life
is
simple
and
does
cost
much
if
i
go
on
and
i
will
go
on
i
could
live
at
gilead
balm
on
what
i
make
and
help
keep
up
the
place
if
ever
i
had
to
live
by
myself
i
could
get
two
or
three
rooms
in
a
city
and
live
there
or
maybe
a
small
house
and
have
thomasine
with
me
in
another
year
or
two
years
i
can
keep
myself
i
do
not
want
to
stay
here
when
grandfather
goes
where
there
is
no
love
and
honour
what
is
the
use
it
is
as
though
he
needed
me
he
does
or
wanted
me
she
laid
the
pencil
down
and
leaned
back
in
the
deep
chair
her
eyes
grew
less
troubled
a
vague
relief
and
calm
came
into
her
face
and
she
smiled
fleetingly
if
he
does
think
he
needs
me
or
wants
me
and
i
do
believe
he
think
so
then
there
is
anything
surer
than
that
i
wo
stay
she
rose
and
paced
the
room
i
should
worry
hagar
some
days
after
this
she
offered
one
afternoon
to
relieve
the
nurse
she
had
done
this
before
and
frequently
heretofore
the
service
had
consisted
since
the
patient
almost
always
slept
through
the
afternoon
in
sitting
quietly
in
the
darkened
chamber
and
dreaming
her
own
dreams
for
an
hour
or
two
when
the
grateful
nurse
came
back
refreshed
she
was
presently
aware
that
he
was
awake
that
he
was
lying
there
with
his
eyes
open
regarding
the
slow
play
of
light
and
shadow
upon
the
ceiling
she
had
found
out
on
those
earlier
occasions
that
he
did
not
discriminate
between
her
and
the
usual
nurse
when
he
roused
himself
to
demand
water
he
had
looked
no
farther
than
the
glass
held
by
her
hand
to
his
lips
now
as
she
felt
at
once
as
with
a
faint
electric
shock
it
was
going
to
be
different
he
spoke
presently
his
voice
though
halting
and
much
weakened
resembled
the
colonel
golden
energetic
drawl
what
time
is
it
five
what
day
of
the
month
she
told
him
alexandria
in
april
he
said
what
impossible
things
happen
she
did
not
answer
and
he
fell
silent
lying
there
staring
at
the
ceiling
in
a
few
minutes
he
asked
for
water
the
glass
at
his
lips
she
felt
that
he
looked
with
curiosity
first
at
the
hand
which
held
it
and
then
at
her
face
water
tastes
good
he
said
does
it
yes
it
does
she
put
down
the
glass
and
returned
to
her
seat
you
are
he
said
the
nurse
i
had
no
she
will
be
back
presently
there
followed
another
pregnant
silence
then
a
beautiful
string
of
impossibilities
i
know
the
colonel
here
been
here
a
long
time
now
did
i
dream
it
or
did
thomson
tell
me
that
he
brought
my
daughter
with
him
thomson
told
you
medway
lay
quite
quiet
and
relaxed
the
cut
over
the
head
was
nearly
healed
there
was
now
but
a
slight
white
bandage
about
it
thomson
had
trimmed
mustache
and
short
pointed
beard
the
features
above
were
bloodless
yet
but
no
longer
sunken
and
ghastly
the
eyes
were
gathering
keenness
and
intelligence
ashendynes
and
coltsworths
were
alike
people
and
medway
had
taken
his
share
he
knew
it
prized
it
and
bestowed
upon
it
a
proper
care
hagar
wondered
wondered
he
spoke
again
life
a
variorum
i
should
wonder
hagar
yes
father
suppose
you
come
over
here
nearer
i
want
to
see
how
you
growed
up
she
moved
her
chair
until
it
rested
full
in
a
slant
ray
of
sunlight
coming
through
the
lowered
blinds
then
sat
within
the
ray
as
still
almost
as
if
she
had
been
sculptured
there
five
minutes
passed
have
you
any
other
name
than
hagar
said
medway
are
they
always
going
to
call
you
that
grandfather
calls
me
gipsy
except
when
he
does
like
what
i
do
does
that
happen
often
are
you
wilful
i
do
not
know
said
hagar
i
am
like
my
mother
when
she
had
spoken
she
repented
it
with
a
pang
of
fear
he
was
in
no
condition
of
course
to
have
waked
old
disturbing
thoughts
but
medway
had
depth
on
depth
of
you
look
like
her
and
you
do
look
like
her
he
murmured
you
may
be
like
her
within
but
you
ca
be
all
like
her
blessings
and
cursings
are
all
mixed
in
this
life
you
must
be
a
little
bit
like
me
gipsy
it
is
time
said
hagar
for
an
egg
beaten
up
in
wine
she
gave
it
to
him
standing
beside
the
bed
i
do
not
think
you
should
talk
shut
your
eyes
and
go
to
sleep
can
you
read
aloud
yes
but
can
you
sing
not
to
amount
to
anything
but
i
can
sing
to
you
very
low
until
you
go
to
sleep
if
that
what
you
mean
all
right
sing
she
moved
from
the
shaft
of
light
and
began
to
croon
rather
than
to
sing
softly
and
dreamily
bits
of
old
songs
and
ballads
in
ten
minutes
he
was
asleep
and
in
ten
more
the
nurse
returned
the
next
afternoon
thomson
brought
her
a
message
ashendyne
would
like
you
to
sit
with
him
awhile
miss
she
went
and
took
her
chair
by
the
window
the
nurse
leaving
the
room
medway
lay
dozing
his
eyes
after
a
while
he
woke
fully
and
asked
who
was
there
it
is
hagar
father
sit
where
you
were
yesterday
she
obeyed
taking
again
her
place
in
the
slant
light
it
made
a
gold
crown
for
her
dusky
hair
slid
to
the
hollow
of
her
firm
young
throat
brought
forward
her
slender
shoulders
draped
in
white
and
bathed
her
long
hands
folded
in
her
lap
medway
lay
and
looked
at
her
coolly
as
long
as
he
pleased
you
are
not
at
all
what
is
called
beautiful
we
dismiss
that
from
mind
but
the
people
who
give
us
our
terms
are
mostly
idiots
anyhow
beauty
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
but
what
bats
are
the
beholders
no
you
have
beauty
as
they
say
but
there
something
left
i
like
the
way
you
sit
there
gipsy
i
am
glad
that
you
are
pleased
father
i
could
deduce
you
from
your
letters
her
eyes
met
his
i
did
not
choose
that
you
should
again
she
felt
a
quiver
of
pain
for
what
she
had
said
she
was
torn
between
a
veritable
anger
which
now
and
again
rose
perilously
near
the
surface
and
a
profound
pity
for
his
broken
body
and
for
what
he
would
feel
when
he
knew
her
dream
of
the
early
winter
haunted
her
she
saw
him
leaving
that
white
steamer
coming
lightly
and
jauntily
down
from
it
to
the
shore
robust
with
a
colour
in
his
cheeks
and
his
white
hat
like
a
helmet
she
heard
again
roger
michael
speaking
we
met
him
at
carcassonne
and
afterwards
at
he
was
sketching
most
wonderfully
she
saw
him
moving
lightly
from
stone
to
stone
in
old
cities
the
dandelion
day
and
the
blossoming
orchard
came
back
to
her
she
felt
again
beneath
her
his
motion
as
he
carried
her
under
the
boughs
where
the
bees
were
humming
her
pity
her
comprehension
put
the
anger
down
medway
was
watching
her
curiously
you
have
a
most
expressive
face
he
said
i
do
not
remember
you
well
as
a
child
how
old
were
you
the
last
time
we
met
five
or
six
i
think
the
clearest
thing
i
can
remember
father
is
one
day
when
you
were
lying
under
the
cedars
and
i
had
been
gathering
dandelions
and
came
to
look
at
a
book
you
had
you
played
with
me
and
i
accidentally
burned
my
finger
on
your
cigar
then
you
were
very
kind
and
lovely
you
took
me
to
grandmother
to
have
it
tied
up
and
then
you
carried
me
on
your
shoulder
through
the
orchard
and
told
me
and
the
beanstalk
by
jove
said
medway
why
i
remember
that
too
first
the
smell
of
the
cedar
and
then
the
apple
blossoms
you
were
a
queer
little
elf
and
you
entered
into
the
morals
of
and
the
beanstalk
most
seriously
good
lack
whoever
forgets
anything
that
to
come
back
as
soft
and
vivid
well
i
thought
i
had
forgotten
you
clean
gipsy
but
it
seems
i
had
you
must
talk
too
much
shall
i
sing
you
to
sleep
yes
sing
just
before
he
dozed
off
he
spoke
again
drowsily
have
you
heard
them
say
how
many
days
it
will
be
before
i
am
on
my
feet
again
no
i
will
want
to
show
you
and
the
colonel
but
she
had
begun
to
croon
swanee
river
and
he
went
to
sleep
with
his
sentence
unfinished
the
next
day
he
spoke
of
his
drowned
wife
it
came
as
a
casual
remark
but
with
propriety
anna
was
a
good
woman
there
could
hardly
have
been
a
more
amiable
one
she
had
experience
and
tact
she
was
utterly
unexacting
she
had
her
interests
and
i
had
mine
we
lived
and
let
live
i
can
not
yet
understand
how
she
happened
to
have
been
the
one
she
sent
me
her
picture
said
hagar
i
thought
it
very
handsome
and
a
good
face
too
and
the
two
or
three
letters
i
had
from
her
i
have
kept
them
she
was
a
good
woman
repeated
medway
you
rarely
see
a
tolerant
woman
she
was
one
her
brother
has
told
me
about
her
will
it
is
true
that
i
expected
perhaps
a
fuller
confidence
but
it
was
her
money
she
had
a
right
to
do
as
she
pleased
i
knew
that
she
had
some
unfortunate
idea
or
other
as
to
the
origin
of
her
wealth
but
i
did
not
conceive
that
her
mind
made
so
much
of
it
however
i
refuse
to
be
troubled
on
that
score
her
disposition
of
matters
leaves
me
comfortable
enough
i
am
not
worrying
over
it
i
never
worry
gipsy
after
lying
for
three
minutes
he
spoke
with
his
inimitable
liquid
drawl
when
i
think
of
all
the
years
out
of
which
i
have
squeezed
enjoyment
on
the
pettiest
income
going
here
and
going
there
every
nook
of
europe
much
of
asia
and
africa
just
managing
to
keep
thomson
and
myself
knowing
every
in
and
out
every
rank
and
grade
and
caste
palace
and
hovel
ch√¢teau
and
garret
camp
and
atelier
knowing
pictures
music
scenery
strange
people
and
strange
adventures
knowing
my
own
kind
and
welcome
among
them
now
basking
like
a
lizard
now
in
action
as
though
a
tarantula
had
bit
me
everywhere
desert
and
sea
and
city
and
all
on
next
to
nothing
making
drawings
when
i
had
to
i
did
that
one
year
in
southern
france
carcassonne
n√Æmes
and
so
forth
but
usually
fortunate
in
friends
it
seems
that
i
might
be
able
to
manage
on
fifty
thousand
a
year
resume
at
the
old
house
it
was
another
week
before
he
was
told
he
was
growing
impatient
and
suspicious
the
doctor
did
it
thomson
flunking
for
the
first
time
in
his
existence
the
doctor
having
done
it
came
out
of
the
room
drew
a
long
breath
and
accepted
coffee
from
mahomet
with
rather
a
shaking
hand
well
demanded
the
colonel
well
he
perfectly
game
said
the
doctor
but
i
should
say
he
hard
hit
however
he
drank
the
coffee
there
one
thing
that
a
considerable
experience
with
human
nature
has
taught
me
and
that
is
colonel
that
your
born
hedonist
and
it
no
disparagement
to
ashendyne
to
call
him
that
quite
the
reverse
your
born
hedonist
will
remain
hedonist
still
though
the
heavens
fall
he
twist
back
to
the
pleasant
he
going
through
pretty
bitter
waters
at
the
moment
but
he
get
life
somehow
on
the
pleasurable
plane
again
all
the
same
mused
the
doctor
he
undoubtedly
suffering
at
present
i
wo
go
in
said
the
colonel
better
fight
such
things
out
alone
the
other
nodded
yes
i
suppose
so
but
a
little
later
hagar
went
in
she
waited
an
hour
or
two
in
her
own
room
sitting
before
a
window
gazing
with
unseeing
eyes
the
heat
swam
and
dazzled
above
countless
flat
pale
parapetted
roofs
of
countless
houses
palm
and
pepper
and
acacia
and
eucalyptus
drooped
in
the
airless
day
there
sounded
a
drone
of
voices
a
great
bird
sailed
slowly
on
stretched
wings
far
overhead
in
a
sky
like
brass
she
turned
and
went
to
her
father
room
outside
she
met
thomson
are
you
going
in
miss
i
glad
of
that
ashendyne
is
one
of
these
people
whom
their
own
company
suffices
hagar
raised
sombre
eyes
i
thought
that
my
father
had
always
been
sufficient
to
himself
not
in
trouble
miss
he
knocked
at
the
door
for
her
medway
voice
answered
strangely
jerky
quick
and
harsh
what
is
it
come
in
thomson
opened
the
door
it
miss
hagar
sir
then
closed
it
upon
her
and
glided
away
down
the
corridor
medway
was
lying
well
up
upon
his
pillows
staring
at
the
light
upon
the
wall
he
had
sent
away
the
nurse
he
did
not
speak
and
hagar
moving
quietly
went
here
and
there
in
the
large
room
that
was
as
large
as
an
audience
chamber
at
the
windows
she
drew
the
jalousies
yet
closer
making
a
rich
twilight
in
the
room
there
were
flowers
on
a
table
and
she
brought
fresh
water
and
filled
the
bowl
in
which
they
lived
there
were
books
in
a
small
case
and
kneeling
before
it
she
read
over
their
titles
and
taking
one
from
the
shelf
went
softly
through
it
looking
at
the
pictures
at
last
with
it
still
in
her
hand
she
came
to
her
accustomed
seat
near
the
bed
it
a
bad
day
for
you
she
said
simply
i
am
very
sorry
do
you
object
to
my
swearing
not
especially
if
it
helps
you
it
wo
i
put
it
off
oh
h
he
turned
his
head
and
shoulders
as
best
he
could
until
his
face
was
buried
in
the
pillows
the
bed
shook
with
his
heavy
gasping
sobs
it
did
not
last
ashendynes
were
not
apt
long
to
indulge
in
that
kind
of
thing
medway
pulled
a
good
oar
out
of
it
the
room
very
soon
became
perfectly
still
again
when
the
silence
was
broken
he
asked
her
what
she
was
reading
and
then
if
she
had
seen
anything
of
the
city
presently
he
told
her
to
sing
he
thought
he
might
sleep
he
had
slept
much
last
night
i
must
have
had
a
presentiment
of
this
damned
thing
go
on
and
sing
she
crooned
dixie
and
swanee
river
and
annie
laurie
but
it
was
of
no
use
he
could
not
sleep
of
all
things
to
come
to
me
this
why
i
should
like
to
be
out
in
the
desert
this
minute
with
a
caravan
o
god
she
brought
him
cool
water
i
sorry
i
sorry
she
said
as
she
put
down
the
glass
he
held
her
by
the
sleeve
a
twisted
smile
half
with
a
glint
of
cheer
crossed
his
face
do
you
know
gipsy
i
could
grow
right
fond
of
you
chapter
xxi
at
roger
on
an
early
april
afternoon
in
the
year
a
man
and
woman
were
crossing
with
much
leisureliness
trafalgar
square
we
wo
get
run
over
it
is
like
paris
are
you
tired
molly
do
you
want
a
hansom
tired
no
what
could
make
me
tired
a
day
like
this
i
want
to
go
stroke
the
lions
they
gravely
went
and
did
so
poor
old
british
lion
listen
news
was
being
cried
of
fight
at
bushman
kop
christopher
josslyn
left
the
lions
ran
across
and
got
a
paper
then
returned
a
small
affair
he
said
how
interminably
the
thing
drags
out
but
they
have
peace
directly
now
yes
but
it
poor
old
lion
just
the
same
they
moved
from
the
four
in
stone
striking
across
to
pall
mall
there
was
a
halcyon
time
in
england
fifty
years
or
so
ago
when
if
you
believe
what
men
wrote
it
was
seriously
held
that
no
civilized
man
would
ever
again
encroach
upon
a
weaker
brother
rights
√¶ons
were
at
hand
of
universal
education
stained
glass
and
ascension
lilies
at
any
rate
√¶ons
of
brotherhood
under
the
kindly
control
of
the
great
elder
brother
england
and
they
had
some
reason
it
looked
for
an
illusory
moment
that
way
i
always
try
to
remember
that
and
moments
like
that
in
every
land
history
at
moments
such
as
these
why
does
that
moment
carry
on
over
there
something
deeply
fundamentally
wrong
he
looked
along
the
crowded
street
men
were
buying
papers
that
seemed
their
chief
employment
kitchener
report
of
fight
at
hartz
not
far
from
a
billion
dollars
expended
on
this
war
and
those
east
side
streets
we
went
through
yesterday
concentration
camps
and
the
coronation
this
reactionary
administration
with
its
corn
laws
and
coercion
laws
and
wretched
education
bill
and
so
on
and
the
coronation
talk
and
piccadilly
last
night
after
nine
oh
said
molly
sharply
that
the
sting
that
i
feel
it
women
and
children
who
are
suffering
in
those
concentration
camps
i
suppose
and
it
women
sons
who
are
lying
on
the
battlefields
and
it
women
just
as
well
as
men
who
are
paying
the
taxes
and
it
women
too
in
those
horrible
slums
wretched
and
hopeless
and
bad
legislation
falls
on
women
just
as
hardly
as
on
men
but
the
other
there
we
got
the
tragedy
mostly
to
ourselves
and
there
no
greater
tragedy
below
the
stars
she
dashed
a
bright
drop
from
her
eyes
i
never
forget
that
girl
last
night
on
the
embankment
thin
and
painted
and
that
hollow
laugh
i
wish
women
would
wake
up
women
and
men
said
the
other
they
waking
but
it
slow
slow
it
slow
the
softened
softened
english
sunlight
bathed
the
broad
street
the
buildings
the
wheeled
traffic
the
people
going
up
and
down
the
two
americans
here
at
last
at
the
latter
end
of
their
six
months
abroad
delighted
in
the
tender
light
in
the
soft
afternoon
sky
with
a
few
sailing
clouds
in
the
street
sights
and
sounds
in
the
english
speech
they
strolled
rather
than
walked
even
at
times
they
dawdled
rather
than
strolled
they
developed
a
tendency
to
stand
before
so
strong
and
handsome
a
pair
were
they
that
they
attracted
some
attention
and
both
tall
both
lithe
active
both
aglow
with
health
she
a
magnificent
rosy
blonde
he
but
with
hair
both
dressed
with
an
unconventional
simplicity
fitness
and
comfort
both
interested
as
children
and
happy
in
each
other
company
those
who
observed
them
did
not
call
them
and
yet
in
a
way
that
was
what
they
were
there
were
three
children
at
home
with
as
splendid
a
grandmother
a
university
had
sent
christopher
to
make
an
investigation
and
the
children
had
said
you
go
too
mother
it
be
splendid
you
need
a
rest
and
christopher
had
said
molly
you
need
another
honeymoon
the
english
weather
was
uncommonly
good
as
they
came
to
green
park
a
was
playing
spring
was
full
at
hand
you
read
it
everywhere
two
men
passed
talking
yes
to
confer
at
klerksdorp
with
steyn
and
botha
and
de
wet
peace
presently
and
none
too
soon
i
should
think
not
i
done
with
wars
little
annie
rooney
played
the
there
is
more
than
one
way
for
societies
to
survive
said
christopher
and
some
day
men
will
find
it
out
you
can
survive
by
being
a
better
duellist
and
for
a
longer
time
than
the
other
fellow
and
you
can
survive
by
being
the
better
toiler
also
with
persistence
or
you
can
survive
by
being
the
better
thinker
in
an
endless
ascending
scale
each
plane
makes
the
lower
largely
unnecessary
is
indeed
the
lower
moved
up
become
more
merciful
and
wiser
survive
to
live
over
to
outlive
the
true
survivor
you
like
to
see
him
see
her
see
molly
yes
said
molly
soberly
we
are
a
long
way
off
christopher
assented
true
enough
and
thank
heaven
the
true
survivor
will
always
vanish
toward
the
truer
yet
but
i
do
know
it
seems
to
me
the
twentieth
century
might
catch
a
faint
far
glimpse
of
our
lineaments
i
am
madly
wildly
rashly
optimistic
for
the
twentieth
century
even
when
i
remember
how
optimistic
they
were
fifty
years
ago
who
could
help
being
optimistic
on
such
an
afternoon
look
at
the
gold
on
the
green
the
played
an
old
gay
dance
do
you
suppose
said
molly
that
in
merry
england
the
milkmaids
and
shepherdesses
danced
about
a
maypole
at
for
that
just
exactly
what
i
should
like
to
do
this
minute
how
absurd
to
be
able
to
climb
the
matterhorn
and
then
not
to
be
let
go
out
there
and
dance
on
that
smooth
bit
of
green
you
might
try
it
only
i
would
answer
for
the
conduct
of
the
policeman
by
the
tree
and
if
you
arrested
we
ca
dine
with
roger
michael
roger
michael
lived
in
a
small
red
georgian
house
in
chelsea
her
grandparents
had
lived
here
and
her
parents
and
she
had
been
born
here
nearer
fifty
than
forty
years
ago
it
had
descended
to
her
and
she
lived
here
still
she
had
an
old
housekeeper
and
a
beautiful
cat
and
two
orphan
children
who
were
almost
the
happiest
children
in
that
part
of
the
world
she
always
kept
children
in
the
house
there
were
a
couple
of
others
whom
she
had
raised
and
who
were
out
in
the
world
doing
well
and
when
the
two
now
with
her
were
no
longer
children
she
would
find
another
two
she
did
not
believe
in
orphan
asylums
she
herself
had
never
married
she
remembered
george
eliot
and
she
had
known
the
rossettis
and
more
slightly
the
carlyles
now
in
her
small
distinguished
house
with
its
atmosphere
of
plain
living
and
high
thinking
fragrant
and
sunny
with
kindliness
and
good
will
she
set
her
table
often
for
her
friends
and
drew
them
together
in
her
simple
her
friends
were
scholars
writing
and
thinking
people
and
simply
good
people
and
any
one
who
was
in
trouble
and
came
to
her
and
many
reformers
she
was
herself
of
old
reforming
stock
and
she
served
humanity
in
all
those
ways
she
had
met
and
liked
the
josslyns
when
she
was
in
america
years
before
and
when
they
wrote
and
told
her
they
were
in
london
she
promptly
named
this
evening
for
them
to
come
to
chelsea
they
found
besides
roger
michael
a
scientific
man
of
name
asked
to
meet
christopher
a
writer
of
plays
a
writer
of
essays
a
noted
fabian
and
as
noted
a
woman
reformer
the
seventh
guest
was
a
little
late
when
she
came
it
was
hagar
ashendyne
what
an
unexpected
pleasure
said
the
josslyns
and
meant
every
word
of
it
how
long
since
that
summer
at
the
new
springs
almost
nine
years
and
you
grown
a
great
famous
woman
not
so
very
great
and
not
so
very
famous
said
hagar
ashendyne
but
i
fortunate
enough
you
a
wind
from
home
you
divine
couple
the
bear
den
do
you
remember
the
day
we
climbed
there
yes
said
molly
and
judge
black
waiting
at
the
foot
oh
i
am
glad
to
see
you
we
did
not
dream
you
were
in
london
we
my
father
and
i
have
been
here
only
a
little
while
all
winter
we
were
in
algeria
then
suddenly
he
wanted
to
see
the
leonardos
in
the
national
her
voice
which
was
very
rich
and
soft
made
musical
notes
of
her
words
she
was
subtly
indescribably
transfigured
and
magnified
she
looked
a
great
woman
while
she
turned
to
greet
others
in
the
room
one
or
two
of
whom
seemed
acquaintances
of
more
or
less
old
standing
molly
and
christopher
were
alike
engaged
in
drawing
rapidly
into
mind
what
they
knew
of
this
countrywoman
they
knew
what
the
world
knew
that
she
was
a
writer
of
short
stories
whose
work
would
probably
live
that
her
work
was
fabulously
in
demand
that
it
had
a
metaphysical
value
as
well
as
a
clutching
interest
they
knew
that
she
was
a
sailing
here
and
there
over
the
globe
with
a
father
whose
insatiable
zest
for
life
crutches
and
could
not
put
under
it
was
their
impression
that
she
had
not
been
in
america
more
than
once
or
twice
in
a
number
of
years
they
read
everything
she
published
they
knew
what
could
be
known
that
way
they
had
that
one
summer
impression
and
memory
she
was
there
still
she
was
that
hagar
ashendyne
also
but
evolved
enriched
roger
michael
never
had
large
and
the
talk
was
oftenest
general
the
fare
that
she
spread
was
very
simple
it
was
enough
and
good
it
gained
that
recognition
and
then
the
attention
went
elsewhere
the
eight
at
the
round
table
were
through
a
long
range
harmoniously
minded
half
at
least
were
old
friends
and
comrades
and
the
other
half
came
easily
to
a
thought
become
articulate
with
less
difficulty
than
usual
wove
with
ductileness
across
and
across
the
table
there
sounded
a
fair
deal
of
laughter
they
were
all
workers
here
and
necessarily
toward
many
issues
enough
but
they
could
talk
shop
and
one
another
shop
and
shop
of
the
world
at
large
with
humour
and
quick
appreciation
of
the
merrier
aspects
of
the
workroom
at
first
naturally
in
a
time
of
public
excitement
they
talked
the
war
in
africa
and
the
sick
longing
the
country
now
felt
for
peace
and
the
general
public
foreboding
undefined
but
very
real
that
had
taken
the
place
of
the
old
complacency
but
then
as
naturally
in
this
company
the
talk
went
to
underlying
slow
hesitant
movements
evolutionary
forces
just
roads
that
people
such
as
these
were
blazing
and
athwart
which
each
reactionary
swing
of
the
pendulum
brought
landslides
and
floods
enough
mountains
of
obstruction
gulfs
of
but
the
roadmakers
the
pioneers
had
the
pioneer
temper
they
were
spinning
ropes
shouldering
picks
stating
to
themselves
and
one
another
that
gulfs
had
been
crossed
before
and
mountains
removed
and
that
on
the
whole
it
was
healthful
exercise
they
were
incurably
hopeful
though
at
quite
long
range
as
reformers
have
to
be
the
fabian
told
a
anecdote
of
a
tory
candidate
the
scientific
man
who
possessed
an
imagination
and
was
a
member
of
the
society
for
psychical
research
gave
a
brief
account
of
new
theory
of
corpuscles
and
hazarded
the
prediction
that
the
next
would
see
remarkable
things
we
know
more
about
radiation
gravity
the
infinitely
little
and
the
infinitely
big
and
then
my
hobby
there
a
curious
increase
of
interest
in
the
question
of
a
fourth
dimension
it
a
strange
age
and
it
going
to
be
stranger
still
or
merely
beautifully
simple
and
homecoming
i
do
know
which
science
and
mysticism
are
fairly
within
hailing
distance
of
each
other
the
talk
went
to
christopher
investigation
and
then
to
and
cecil
rhodes
will
and
astonishing
feat
of
receiving
in
newfoundland
wireless
signals
from
a
station
on
the
english
coast
and
flight
in
a
veritable
airship
the
writer
of
essays
who
was
a
woman
and
an
earnest
and
loving
one
had
recently
published
a
paper
upon
a
term
that
had
hardly
as
yet
come
into
general
use
an
article
as
earnest
and
loving
as
herself
roger
michael
had
liked
it
greatly
and
so
had
others
at
the
table
now
they
made
the
writer
go
over
a
point
or
two
which
she
did
quietly
elaborating
what
she
had
first
said
only
the
writer
of
plays
his
last
one
being
at
the
moment
in
the
hands
of
the
censor
chose
to
be
strangely
deeply
desperately
pessimistic
i
am
going
he
said
to
quote
huxley
not
that
i
could
say
it
as
well
myself
says
huxley
know
of
no
study
which
is
so
unutterably
saddening
as
that
of
the
evolution
of
humanity
out
of
the
darkness
of
prehistoric
ages
man
emerges
with
the
mark
of
his
lowly
origin
strong
upon
him
he
is
a
brute
more
intelligent
than
other
brutes
a
blind
prey
to
impulses
which
as
often
as
not
lead
him
to
destruction
a
victim
to
endless
illusions
which
make
his
mental
existence
a
terror
and
a
burthen
and
fill
his
physical
life
with
barren
toil
and
battle
he
attains
a
certain
degree
of
comfort
and
develops
a
more
or
less
workable
theory
of
life
and
then
for
thousands
of
years
struggles
with
varying
fortunes
attended
by
infinite
wickedness
bloodshed
and
misery
to
maintain
himself
at
that
point
against
the
greed
and
ambition
of
his
he
makes
a
point
of
killing
and
otherwise
persecuting
all
those
who
first
try
to
get
him
to
move
on
and
when
he
has
moved
a
step
farther
foolishly
confers
deification
on
his
victims
he
exactly
repeats
the
process
with
all
who
want
him
to
move
a
step
yet
farther
that
said
the
writer
of
plays
is
what
happens
to
brains
aspiration
and
altruism
in
combination
rack
and
thumbscrews
and
and
maybe
in
five
hundred
years
or
a
thousand
a
picture
skied
by
the
royal
academy
bruno
going
to
the
stake
recanting
of
arc
before
her
judges
my
own
theory
of
the
world
is
that
it
is
standing
on
its
head
naturally
it
resents
the
presence
of
people
whose
heads
are
in
the
clouds
naturally
it
finds
them
rather
ridiculous
and
contrary
to
all
the
proprieties
and
violently
to
be
pulled
down
moral
keep
your
brains
close
to
safety
and
the
creeping
herb
i
think
that
you
worry
said
the
fabian
much
too
much
about
that
play
i
do
believe
there
the
slightest
prospect
that
he
think
it
fit
to
be
produced
the
woman
reformer
was
talking
with
molly
yes
it
a
long
struggle
we
been
at
it
since
the
just
as
you
have
been
in
america
a
long
long
time
the
movement
in
both
countries
is
a
woman
of
almost
sixty
years
we
needed
what
they
say
we
have
patience
sometimes
i
think
we
been
too
patient
you
younger
women
have
got
to
come
in
and
take
hold
and
give
what
perhaps
the
older
type
could
give
organization
and
wider
knowledge
and
modern
courage
we
given
the
courage
all
right
and
you
have
to
have
the
patience
and
staying
qualities
too
but
there
needed
now
a
higher
heart
and
a
freer
step
than
we
could
give
in
that
world
that
we
coming
out
of
i
think
that
i
always
thought
it
right
said
molly
but
never
really
come
out
and
said
so
or
become
identified
in
any
of
course
it
is
thinking
so
very
positively
if
you
have
done
that
it
is
like
that
with
almost
every
one
diffused
thought
and
then
suddenly
one
day
something
happens
or
another
mind
touches
yours
and
out
of
the
mist
there
gathers
form
determination
action
you
all
right
my
dear
only
i
hope
when
you
go
home
you
will
speak
out
join
some
organization
that
is
the
simple
right
thing
that
every
one
can
do
concerted
effort
is
the
effort
that
tells
are
you
speaking
asked
hagar
ashendyne
of
the
suffrage
movement
they
were
back
in
the
all
gathered
more
or
less
closely
around
a
light
fire
upon
the
hearth
kindled
for
the
comfort
of
americans
who
always
found
england
so
cold
it
softened
and
brightened
all
the
room
quaint
and
where
for
a
hundred
years
distinguished
quiet
people
had
come
and
gone
yes
said
the
older
woman
are
you
interested
yes
of
course
she
had
not
spoken
much
at
dinner
but
had
sat
a
pearl
of
listeners
deep
soft
eyes
upon
each
discourser
in
turn
there
was
in
the
minds
of
all
an
interest
and
curiosity
regarding
her
her
work
was
very
good
she
had
personality
to
an
extraordinary
degree
now
she
spoke
in
a
voice
that
had
a
little
of
the
ashendyne
golden
drawl
i
have
been
in
the
last
eight
years
oh
all
over
europe
yes
but
more
especially
it
seems
to
me
looking
back
the
orient
egypt
all
north
africa
turkey
and
persia
japan
and
india
yes
and
europe
too
greece
and
italy
and
spain
the
and
the
north
around
the
world
a
little
of
spanish
america
a
little
of
the
islands
sometimes
long
in
one
place
sometimes
only
a
few
days
everywhere
it
was
always
the
same
the
social
organism
with
a
shrivelled
side
the
writer
of
plays
was
in
a
mood
to
take
issue
with
his
every
deepest
conviction
also
to
say
banal
things
but
are
american
women
the
freest
in
the
world
hagar
ashendyne
did
not
answer
she
sat
in
a
deep
armchair
her
elbow
upon
the
arm
her
chin
in
her
hand
her
eyes
dreaming
upon
the
fire
but
christopher
entered
the
lists
yes
perhaps
they
are
the
italian
woman
is
freer
than
the
oriental
woman
and
the
german
woman
is
freer
than
the
italian
and
the
english
woman
is
freer
than
the
german
and
the
american
is
freer
than
the
english
but
what
have
they
to
do
with
and
it
is
a
question
of
being
free
free
politically
free
in
all
human
ways
politically
being
one
i
do
not
see
how
a
man
can
endure
to
say
to
a
woman
are
less
free
than
i
am
but
be
satisfied
you
are
so
much
freer
than
that
wretch
over
there
hagar
rose
her
eyes
chanced
to
meet
those
of
the
man
who
had
talked
physics
and
mysticism
we
sha
she
said
get
into
the
fourth
dimension
while
we
have
a
shrivelled
side
we
ca
limp
into
that
you
know
she
crossed
the
room
and
stood
before
a
portrait
hung
above
a
sofa
roger
michael
come
tell
me
about
this
quaker
lady
she
left
before
ten
pleading
an
early
rising
for
work
that
must
be
done
and
molly
and
christopher
would
come
to
see
her
she
might
be
a
month
in
london
christopher
and
the
fabian
saw
her
into
her
cab
and
she
gave
each
her
hand
and
was
driven
away
that
said
the
fabian
as
they
turned
back
to
the
house
is
a
woman
one
could
die
for
it
was
a
long
way

were
staying

of

the

came
in
at
the
lowered
window
soft
and
cool
with
a
hint
now
of

hagar
was
dreaming
of

was
a
green

in

it
was

the

of

floated
pleasantly
in
at

what
not
that
prolonged
sojourn

convalescence
in

had
produced
a

that

when

and
wicker
detachable
receptacles
for
and
and
pencils
and
the
book
he
was
reading
and
so
forth
where
he
travelled
now
the
must
travel
he
was
good
with
crutches
for
a
hundred
paces
or
two
then
he
must
sit
down
and
gather
force
for
the
next
hundred
he
suffered
at
times
not
at
all
constantly
a
good
deal
of
pain
but
with
all
of
this
understood
he
yet
looked
a
vigorous
person
fresh
hale
with
not
a
grey
hair
a
young
man
still
bogot√°
he
said
an
archiepiscopal
see
universities
libraries
and
a
botanic
garden
and
meridional
culture
tempered
by
revolutions
by
all
means
let
us
go
to
bogot√°
gipsy
hagar
smiled
sat
without
speaking
waiting
her
eyes
upon
thomson
putting
the
last
touches
to
the
table
and
mahomet
thrusting
irises
into
the
vases
the
faces
of
both
discreetly
masking
whatever
interest
they
might
feel
in
the
proposed
itinerary
when
after
another
minute
or
two
they
were
gone
from
the
room
were
you
waiting
for
them
to
go
why
who
keeps
anything
from
thomson
he
knows
my
innermost
soul
i
told
him
this
morning
i
was
thinking
of
south
america
hagar
rose
and
with
her
hands
behind
her
head
began
slowly
to
pace
the
large
room
bogot√°
bogot√°
is
all
right
you
the
surest
instinct
of
course
when
it
comes
to
matching
your
mood
with
your
place
you
a
marvel
there
as
you
are
in
so
many
ways
father
and
thomson
and
mahomet
would
like
it
too
i
think
do
you
mean
that
you
wo
like
it
no
i
should
like
it
very
much
but
i
am
not
going
father
medway
made
an
impatient
movement
we
have
had
this
before
yes
but
not
so
determinedly
why
not
agree
that
the
battle
is
over
it
over
and
you
rest
the
conqueror
in
this
yes
i
could
see
said
medway
some
point
in
it
if
the
existence
you
lead
with
me
made
the
fulfilment
of
your
undoubted
talent
your
genius
perhaps
impossible
but
you
write
wherever
we
go
you
work
steadily
yes
said
hagar
but
the
work
by
which
you
live
is
not
all
of
life
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
touched
life
at
a
good
many
points
in
these
eight
years
being
with
you
said
hagar
has
been
a
liberal
education
she
laughed
with
soft
deliberate
merriment
but
she
meant
what
she
said
from
a
slender
green
vase
she
took
an
iris
and
coming
to
the
knelt
down
and
drew
the
long
stalk
through
the
appropriate
buttonhole
you
must
have
as
large
a
bouquet
as
that
she
said
yes
a
university
and
a
i
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
they
both
laughed
well
you
paid
your
way
he
said
literally
and
metaphorically
i
suppose
two
gratitudes
cancel
each
other
leaving
an
understanding
friendship
she
grew
graver
a
good
deal
of
love
too
i
want
you
to
realize
that
she
laughed
again
i
do
not
always
approve
you
you
know
but
thank
god
i
can
love
without
always
approving
medway
nodded
i
like
a
tolerant
woman
she
rose
and
stood
regarding
him
with
a
twisted
smile
affectionate
and
pitying
i
think
that
you
are
a
fearfully
selfish
man
to
quote
stevenson
quoted
by
henley
unconscious
easy
selfish
person
and
i
think
that
of
your
own
brand
you
have
grit
and
pluck
and
stamina
for
twenty
men
there
no
malice
or
envy
in
you
and
intellectually
honest
and
you
can
be
the
best
company
in
the
world
i
am
very
fond
of
you
are
you
the
selfish
person
not
to
be
willing
to
go
to
bogot√°
perhaps
perhaps
said
hagar
ashendyne
but
i
am
not
willing
what
is
it
that
you
do
want
that
is
the
first
time
you
have
asked
me
that
wandering
is
good
but
it
is
not
good
for
all
of
life
i
want
to
return
to
my
own
country
and
to
live
there
i
want
to
grow
in
my
native
forest
and
serve
in
my
own
place
to
live
at
gilead
balm
with
bob
and
serena
no
i
do
not
mean
that
precisely
hagar
pushed
back
her
heavy
hair
i
have
thought
it
out
perfectly
but
it
has
grown
to
be
wrong
to
me
personally
to
wander
wander
forever
like
this
irresponsible
brushing
life
with
moth
wings
if
i
saw
any
end
to
it
but
i
do
not
and
you
wish
to
cut
the
painter
this
comes
said
medway
of
the
damned
modern
independence
of
women
if
you
could
write
earn
you
trot
along
quietly
enough
the
pivotal
mistake
was
letting
women
learn
the
alphabet
i
could
always
have
taken
a
position
as
housemaid
said
hagar
serenely
you
ca
make
me
angry
and
so
get
the
best
of
me
and
you
like
me
better
knowing
the
alphabet
and
there
no
use
in
your
denying
it
if
only
you
would
conceive
that
it
were
possible
for
you
to
return
to
america
to
take
a
house
to
there
and
still
you
could
travel
sometimes
with
me
sometimes
without
me
travel
often
if
you
pleased
and
far
and
wide
would
it
be
so
distasteful
profoundly
so
said
medway
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
it
i
should
be
bored
to
what
is
your
alternative
i
shall
be
glad
to
spend
three
months
out
of
every
year
with
you
is
that
your
last
word
yes
suppose
you
do
not
begin
the
arrangement
until
next
year
then
we
can
still
go
to
bogot√°
are
you
so
wild
to
go
to
bogot√°
all
life
said
medway
is
based
upon
compromise
hagar
pacing
to
and
fro
in
her
soft
cotton
with
its
fine
deep
collar
of
valenciennes
stopped
now
before
the
purple
irises
and
now
before
the
white
had
i
not
appeared
by
your
bedside
in
alexandria
eight
years
ago
had
i
not
been
at
hand
during
that
convalescence
for
you
to
grow
a
little
fond
of
you
would
have
all
these
years
taken
thomson
and
mahomet
and
gone
to
every
place
where
we
have
gone
just
the
same
just
the
same
and
with
i
hardly
doubt
just
as
full
enjoyment
if
you
had
not
liked
me
you
would
with
the
entirest
equanimity
have
bidden
me
and
seen
me
return
with
grandfather
to
gilead
balm
and
you
would
have
travelled
on
finding
and
making
friends
acquaintances
and
servants
as
you
do
to
so
remarkable
a
degree
missing
not
one
station
or
event
if
i
died
you
would
do
every
proper
thing
and
in
the
autumn
proceed
to
bogot√°
granting
all
that
said
medway
it
remains
that
i
find
and
have
found
in
the
past
a
pleasure
in
your
i
am
going
to
remind
you
again
gipsy
that
all
life
is
compromise
hagar
at
the
window
in
the
green
and
shimmering
light
like
the
bottom
of
the
sea
leaned
her
forehead
against
the
sash
and
looked
across
into
the
leafy
gardens
children
were
there
playing
and
calling
a
young
girl
passed
carrying
smart
bandboxes
then
an
old
woman
stooping
using
a
cane
with
her
a
great
dog
and
a
young
woman
in
the
dress
of
a
nurse
the
soft
rumble
and
crying
of
the
city
droned
in
together
with
a
bee
that
made
for
the
nearest
flower
hagar
turned
i
will
go
with
you
for
another
year
father
but
after
that
i
will
go
home
no
end
of
things
said
medway
can
happen
in
a
year
i
never
cross
a
bridge
that
three
hundred
and
days
i
advise
you
if
you
have
already
done
so
to
read
humboldt
he
had
a
luncheon
engagement
and
at
twelve
vanished
thomson
and
mahomet
in
attendance
this
his
large
chamber
and
bath
an
adjoining
room
with
its
own
entrance
for
thomson
quarters
somewhere
for
mahomet
were
his
he
paid
for
them
hagar
had
two
rooms
her
bedroom
and
a
much
smaller
they
were
hers
she
paid
for
them
after
the
first
two
years
she
had
assumed
utterly
her
own
support
medway
had
shrugged
as
you
choose
now
in
her
own
rooms
she
wrote
through
the
early
afternoon
then
rising
weighted
the
sheets
of
manuscript
with
a
jade
buddha
put
on
a
street
dress
and
went
out
into
the
divine
mild
may
weather
she
knew
people
in
london
she
had
acquaintances
engagements
but
was
free
she
walked
a
long
way
the
air
was
so
sweet
and
at
last
she
found
herself
before
westminster
abbey
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
went
in
the
great
crowded
place
was
empty
almost
of
the
living
a
few
tourist
figures
flitted
vaguely
she
moved
slowly
over
the
dust
of
the
dead
between
the
dull
encumbering
marbles
until
she
reached
a
corner
that
she
liked
sitting
here
her
head
a
little
thrown
back
against
the
stone
her
soul
opened
the
gates
of
quiet
rose
and
purple
light
sifted
down
from
the
great
windows
all
about
was
the
dim
thought
of
dead
kings
and
queens
soldiers
poets
men
of
the
state
in
the
organ
loft
some
one
touched
the
organ
keys
a
few
chords
were
sounded
then
the
vibration
ceased
hagar
sat
very
still
her
eyes
closed
her
soul
was
searching
searching
not
tumultuously
but
quietly
quietly
it
touched
the
past
here
and
there
and
lighted
it
up
days
and
nights
dreams
ambitions
aspirations
some
dreams
some
ambitions
were
in
the
way
of
fulfilment
medway
ashendyne
was
within
her
she
too
knew
for
to
admire
an
for
to
see
she
had
wandered
and
had
seen
she
would
always
love
to
wander
crave
for
to
see
and
to
admire
to
write
to
earn
to
write
her
lips
curved
into
the
slightest
smile
the
old
days
and
nights
when
she
had
wondered
wondered
if
that
would
ever
come
to
pass
if
it
ever
come
to
pass
it
had
come
to
pass
to
do
better
work
and
always
better
work
that
was
a
continuing
impulse
but
it
was
still
and
steady
now
not
fevered
her
mind
swept
with
wider
wings
to
know
to
learn
to
gain
in
content
and
in
fineness
to
gather
being
knowledge
wisdom
bliss
to
gather
and
then
from
her
granary
to
give
the
increase
that
was
the
containing
the
undying
desire
she
had
a
strange
passion
for
the
future
for
all
that
might
become
she
was
sensitive
to
the
wild
and
scattered
motion
within
the
whole
atom
colliding
with
atom
all
looking
for
the
outlet
into
freedom
power
glory
all
groping
beating
the
air
with
unclutching
hands
missing
the
outlet
it
was
perhaps
so
small
she
thought
of
an
expression
of
george
meredith
to
see
the
lynx
that
sees
the
light
to
see
it
to
follow
to
help
find
the
opening
what
was
needed
was
direction
and
then
unity
of
movement
the
atoms
in
one
stream
resistless
that
when
the
lightning
bolt
went
across
the
sky
was
what
happened
corpuscles
streaming
freely
going
side
by
side
not
face
against
face
not
energy
dashing
itself
endlessly
against
energy
it
was
all
one
physical
and
psychic
power
lay
in
community
of
understanding
public
opinion
community
of
understanding
minds
moving
in
a
like
direction
power
resulting
power
to
accomplish
mighty
and
mightier
things
then
do
your
best
to
ennoble
public
opinion
do
not
think
whether
your
best
is
little
or
great
do
your
best
she
opened
her
eyes
upon
the
light
sifting
down
from
the
rose
windows
it
was
shortening
the
shaft
evening
was
at
hand
in
the
church
of
the
great
dead
many
who
lay
there
had
had
within
them
a
lynx
that
saw
the
light
and
had
tried
to
bring
the
mass
of
their
being
to
follow
many
had
ennobled
the
one
this
way
and
one
that
each
had
brought
to
the
vast
granary
his
handful
of
wheat
ruby
and
amethyst
the
light
lay
athwart
the
pillars
like
an
ethereal
stair
the
organist
touched
the
organ
again
a
verger
came
down
the
aisle
it
was
closing
time
hagar
rose
and
went
out
into
what
sunshine
lay
over
london
chapter
xxiii
by
the
sea
but
after
all
they
did
not
go
to
bogot√°
that
autumn
a
revolution
flared
up
in
colombia
medway
considered
the
matter
but
finally
shrugged
and
shook
his
head
his
point
gained
and
bogot√°
prepared
for
he
gave
the
idea
up
for
this
time
with
entire
nonchalance
but
they
were
in
new
york
by
now
and
something
must
be
done
he
went
with
hagar
to
gilead
balm
for
two
weeks
going
home
for
the
second
time
in
eight
years
the
first
time
had
been
perhaps
two
years
after
his
accident
old
miss
had
cried
out
so
to
him
to
come
had
so
passionately
besought
him
to
let
her
see
him
again
and
hagar
had
so
steadfastly
supported
her
claim
that
at
last
he
gave
in
and
went
he
spent
two
months
at
gilead
balm
and
he
had
been
gracious
and
considerate
to
all
the
family
with
an
extra
touch
for
his
mother
but
when
he
went
away
he
evidently
considered
that
he
had
done
all
that
mortal
could
ask
and
though
old
miss
continued
to
write
to
him
every
three
months
and
though
she
always
said
and
when
are
you
coming
home
she
never
so
urged
the
matter
again
now
he
went
with
hagar
down
through
the
late
autumn
country
to
his
birthplace
and
stayed
for
a
fortnight
as
unruffled
debonair
and
dominant
as
before
the
colonel
and
old
miss
had
each
of
them
years
enough
now
as
age
is
counted
they
were
old
but
each
came
of
a
stock
and
they
held
their
own
to
a
marvel
hagar
could
see
the
difference
the
years
had
made
but
there
was
no
overwhelming
difference
the
colonel
did
not
ride
so
far
and
old
miss
though
she
jealously
guarded
her
and
abated
authority
not
a
jot
was
less
active
than
of
old
she
had
grown
rather
deaf
and
medway
avoided
much
conversation
with
her
captain
bob
was
more
broken
he
looked
older
than
the
elder
brother
luna
was
dead
long
ago
and
he
had
another
hound
lisa
he
was
fond
of
lisa
and
lisa
of
him
but
lisa
was
not
luna
and
he
was
very
faithful
to
luna
memory
and
always
telling
stories
of
her
intelligence
and
exploits
miss
serena
had
changed
very
little
green
was
dead
and
the
overseer
house
at
the
moment
stood
empty
was
dead
too
but
mary
magazine
kept
house
for
isham
hagar
walked
down
to
the
ferry
and
she
and
mary
magazine
talked
about
the
old
flower
dolls
and
the
hayloft
and
the
cavern
by
the
spring
she
walked
by
herself
upon
the
ridge
and
sat
under
the
cucumber
tree
and
went
to
the
north
side
and
leaning
against
the
beech
which
had
grown
to
be
a
tree
looked
down
the
long
slope
to
the
hollow
and
streamlet
the
sunken
boulder
and
thicket
the
two
weeks
passed
indian
summer
held
throughout
november
this
dreamy
place
makes
you
disinclined
to
vigorous
planning
said
medway
i
think
gipsy
that
we
will
drift
on
down
through
florida
and
cross
to
cuba
this
year
there
were
evidently
at
palm
beach
medway
came
upon
an
old
acquaintance
associate
of
ancient
days
in
paris
an
artist
with
whom
he
had
rambled
through
fontainebleau
forest
and
drunk
good
wine
in
barbizon
for
years
each
had
been
to
the
other
a
thin
memory
now
almost
with
violence
the
attraction
renewed
itself
but
the
artist
was
not
going
to
cuba
he
was
going
to
the
bahamas
he
had
a
commission
to
paint
a
portrait
and
his
subject
who
was
a
chicago
had
elected
to
winter
at
nassau
and
to
give
the
sittings
there
commissions
evidently
did
not
come
every
day
to
the
artist
who
was
and
he
was
quite
willing
to
go
to
nassau
jubilantly
so
in
fact
he
said
that
for
once
light
was
going
to
be
thrown
upon
the
medway
strove
to
persuade
him
to
forfeit
the
commission
and
go
to
cuba
and
he
was
even
it
was
evident
prepared
to
make
the
proceeding
no
financial
loss
but
the
artist
stated
explicitly
that
he
had
a
sense
of
honour
and
could
not
leave
the
chicagoan
in
the
lurch
besides
he
wanted
to
paint
that
portrait
come
and
see
me
do
it
old
fellow
i
going
to
take
a
reasonable
small
house
with
a
garden
knock
out
partitions
and
make
a
studio
one
commission
leads
to
another
light
on
the
whole
oh
i
told
that
you
got
a
million
too
how
the
devil
did
you
get
into
that
galley
in
the
end
rather
than
part
with
the
old
companion
medway
exchanged
cuba
for
the
bahamas
thomson
found
a
house
that
he
thought
would
answer
hagar
went
with
him
to
see
it
and
agreed
that
it
would
both
spoke
entirely
with
reference
to
medway
back
at
the
great
hotel
she
explained
its
advantages
there
a
pleasing
tangled
garden
palms
and
orange
trees
and
hibiscus
and
a
high
garden
wall
the
verandahs
upper
and
lower
are
wide
you
get
the
air
and
you
have
besides
the
town
a
great
sweep
of
this
turquoise
sea
there
only
a
short
quiet
easy
street
between
the
house
and
greer
studio
i
think
that
it
will
answer
it
answered
very
well
as
medway
granted
he
and
greer
were
much
together
the
chicagoan
when
he
arrived
proved
to
be
a
good
fellow
too
earnest
in
his
endeavour
to
play
to
culture
greer
gathered
from
the
hotel
several
congenial
americans
medway
who
always
had
the
best
of
letters
provided
an
englishman
or
two
from
the
more
or
less
stationary
government
set
the
studio
became
practically
his
and
greer
in
common
they
were
extraordinarily
good
talkers
and
they
rolled
wonderful
cigarettes
and
mahomet
made
a
violinist
of
some
note
was
stopping
at
the
hotel
and
he
and
his
violin
added
themselves
to
the
company
when
a
traveller
who
knew
lhasa
bangkok
and
baalbek
knossos
and
kairwan
and
kandy
was
joined
to
the
others
it
became
evident
that
medway
had
made
his
circle
and
found
the
winter
entertainment
he
had
never
made
greatly
too
large
demand
upon
hagar
hours
he
was
full
of
resources
supple
in
turning
from
person
to
person
of
all
his
varied
acquaintance
in
varied
lands
moderately
appreciative
too
of
the
value
of
solitude
on
her
side
she
would
have
stood
had
there
been
need
for
time
to
herself
it
was
to
her
the
very
breath
of
life
but
there
was
never
extreme
need
she
was
within
call
when
he
wanted
to
turn
to
her
and
that
was
sufficient
but
this
winter
it
was
evident
she
would
have
her
days
to
a
greater
extent
than
usual
in
her
own
hand
there
was
never
any
accounting
to
him
for
her
days
apart
from
him
almost
from
the
first
there
had
obtained
that
relation
of
personal
liberty
to
do
him
justice
he
felt
no
desire
to
exact
such
an
accounting
and
had
he
tried
to
do
so
he
would
have
failed
hagar
saw
that
she
was
going
to
have
time
time
this
winter
and
what
she
liked
they
would
be
long
enough
in
one
place
to
allow
her
to
work
with
advantage
there
would
be
visitors
invitations
already
they
had
begun
medway
would
wish
to
give
now
and
then
a
a
but
life
would
by
no
means
run
to
an
exchange
of
visits
and
entertainments
father
and
daughter
had
alike
in
this
direction
the
art
of
sufficient
but
not
too
much
anything
beyond
a
certain
amount
wearied
and
exasperated
him
wearied
and
saddened
her
all
that
would
be
kept
in
bounds
hagar
pacing
the
garden
saw
quiet
days
surcharged
with
light
she
was
thinking
out
her
work
a
volume
of
stories
eight
or
ten
in
all
such
a
subject
and
such
a
subject
such
or
such
an
incident
situation
value
such
a
man
such
a
woman
she
knew
that
her
work
was
good
that
it
was
counted
very
good
counted
to
her
for
name
and
fame
all
that
was
something
to
her
rather
it
was
much
to
her
but
only
positively
so
not
relatively
it
could
by
no
means
fill
her
universe
for
years
she
had
taken
now
this
now
that
value
and
with
skill
and
power
had
enlarged
coloured
and
arranged
it
so
that
her
great
audience
might
also
see
and
she
had
done
she
thought
service
thereby
had
in
her
place
served
beauty
and
knowledge
but
the
hunger
grew
to
serve
more
fully
knowledge
knowledge
wisdom
wisdom
action
hagar
moved
to
a
stone
seat
that
commanded
an
opening
in
the
garden
wall
she
looked
out
down
and
over
a
short
steep
dazzling
white
street
and
a
swarm
of
low
chimneyless
houses
with
the
green
between
of
tropic
trees
to
the
surf
upon
the
coral
shore
and
the
opaque
marvellous
blue
of
the
surrounding
sea
the
creative
passion
was
upon
her
but
it
moved
nowadays
as
it
had
moved
with
many
an
before
to
mould
living
material
to
deal
with
the
objective
to
deal
with
the
living
world
not
the
world
of
shadows
to
see
the
living
world
lighten
to
the
dawn
see
the
dull
hues
brighten
see
the
beautyless
become
beauty
and
beauty
grow
vivid
to
see
all
the
world
lift
lift
toward
the
golden
day
to
see
the
race
become
the
she
would
have
died
for
that
and
died
to
help
she
laid
her
arms
along
the
stone
and
her
head
upon
them
and
yet
i
do
not
help
or
not
with
all
that
is
in
me
i
sit
here
to
one
side
and
spin
fancies
she
rose
and
put
on
a
shady
hat
and
going
out
into
the
dazzling
white
street
moved
down
it
and
then
by
another
across
for
some
distance
to
the
white
road
by
the
sea
her
back
to
the
town
she
walked
on
a
few
scattered
palms
the
then
where
it
ended
an
edging
tangle
of
the
hard
green
leaves
of
the
outside
of
that
low
fantastically
worn
coral
rock
and
the
white
dash
and
spray
of
the
water
though
the
sun
was
high
and
the
sky
intense
and
cloudless
a
wind
blew
always
the
air
was
dry
and
the
day
not
too
warm
there
was
hardly
anyone
upon
the
road
she
met
a
cluster
of
negro
children
and
talked
with
them
a
little
a
surrey
of
the
type
that
waited
on
the
street
near
the
great
hotels
passed
her
driven
sleepily
by
a
sleepy
negro
within
it
a
large
man
in
white
when
it
was
gone
in
a
little
cloud
of
white
dust
there
was
only
the
long
road
and
the
unyielding
monotonous
green
of
the
and
the
water
thundering
in
an
undertone
hagar
turned
aside
broke
through
the
grape
and
came
down
to
the
edge
of
the
surf
there
was
a
rock
hollowed
until
it
made
a
rude
chair
she
sat
down
and
looked
out
to
sea
on
one
hand
across
the
harbour
mouth
rose
from
a
sliver
of
land
a
squat
white
lighthouse
but
turn
a
little
and
look
away
and
there
was
only
the
open
sea
unimaginably
blue
azure
as
the
sky
the
soft
wind
blew
the
surf
broke
in
low
thunder
hagar
her
chin
upon
her
hand
sat
for
a
long
time
very
still
how
good
is
man
life
the
mere
living
it
seemed
true
enough
sitting
there
in
the
sunshine
in
the
heart
of
so
rich
a
beauty
she
agreed
how
good
it
was
how
good
it
often
was
only
only
the
line
was
true
perhaps
of
all
at
some
time
of
some
at
all
times
though
she
doubted
that
but
never
of
all
at
all
times
it
was
true
of
a
host
at
very
few
times
it
was
never
so
true
of
any
as
it
might
be
how
good
is
man
life
the
mere
living
how
fit
to
employ
all
the
heart
and
the
soul
and
the
senses
forever
in
joy
who
felt
that
not
even
the
poets
immemorial
who
so
sang
sang
often
in
sadness
of
heart
they
felt
only
the
promise
that
the
future
cast
before
her
association
of
ideas
was
so
strong
and
quick
within
her
that
she
was
apt
to
call
up
images
not
singly
but
in
series
and
sequences
her
mind
swept
away
from
the
west
indian
sea
she
saw
her
mother
at
gilead
balm
beating
her
wings
against
invisible
bars
the
woman
on
the
racked
with
anxiety
her
child
in
her
arms
begging
her
way
to
her
sick
mate
the
figure
of
the
convict
at
the
lock
thomasine
in
the
silk
mill
omega
street
she
thought
of
rachel
and
her
married
life
of
things
which
she
had
heard
at
the
settlement
and
the
pain
in
elizabeth
eden
eyes
as
she
told
them
she
thought
of
eglantine
and
its
insidious
sapping
sapping
of
miss
serena
and
her
stunted
small
industries
and
soul
she
thought
of
miss
bedford
and
of
francie
smythe
and
of
legrand
she
seemed
again
to
hear
legrand
upon
roger
michael
she
thought
of
the
bishop
and
the
day
he
passed
sentence
upon
a
child
for
reading
a
great
book
she
saw
the
thicket
back
of
the
ridge
and
dogs
set
by
a
human
being
upon
a
human
being
she
saw
winter
streets
in
new
york
and
the
light
shining
on
the
three
balls
of
the
pawnbrokers
and
a
and
men
and
women
huddled
on
park
benches
while
the
wind
shook
the
leafless
trees
she
saw
wall
street
and
timothy
her
mind
passed
overseas
russia
three
summers
before
they
had
been
there
medway
though
he
laughed
at
her
had
agreed
to
a
stepping
aside
which
she
proposed
she
wished
to
see
tolstoy
it
was
always
easy
to
him
to
arrange
such
things
and
it
had
ended
in
their
being
invited
for
two
days
to
y√°snaya
poly√°na
she
saw
again
the
old
man
and
heard
his
slow
words
but
his
mind
through
his
pen
was
not
it
acted
it
scourged
it
fought
it
strove
to
build
and
to
clear
the
ground
that
it
might
build
he
deceived
himself
the
tremendous
old
man
he
thought
himself
quietist
as
but
there
in
that
bare
small
study
he
cried
allah
and
fought
like
a
mohammedan
russia
and
the
burden
of
russia
the
world
and
the
burden
of
the
world
she
thought
of
the
east
and
now
her
mind
entered
zenanas
of
india
and
it
was
the
child
marriages
of
turkey
egypt
algeria
morocco
and
it
was
the
veiled
women
proclaimed
without
souls
she
saw
the
eunuchs
at
the
gate
away
to
europe
and
she
saw
that
concept
grading
away
but
never
quite
gone
never
quite
gone
woman
as
mind
undying
and
unrelated
the
arbiter
of
her
own
destiny
the
definer
of
her
own
powers
with
an
equal
goal
and
few
were
the
earthly
places
where
that
ray
fell
how
good
is
man
life
the
mere
living
with
vast
modifications
and
withdrawals
with
dross
and
alloy
said
hagar
but
it
might
be
o
god
it
might
be
lift
all
desire
and
you
lift
the
whole
lift
the
present
steady
steady
and
know
that
one
day
the
future
will
blossom
and
a

is
now

denny
gayde
a
few
days
after
this
she
grew
tired
one
morning
of
working
at
ten
she
put
away
paper
and
pencil
pen
and
ink
letters
and
manuscript
and
went
out
first
into
the
garden
and
then
through
the
gate
in
the
wall
into
the
high
white
light
of
the
street
and
the
town
few
were
abroad
in
this
section
she
gave
a
friendly
nod
to
those
she
met
but
they
were
not
many
an
old
negress
carrying
chickens
a
few
slow
wagons
a
priest
a
young
girl
and
boy
with
tennis
rackets
two
or
three
others
the
street
swam
in
light
the
blue
vault
above
sprang
intense
there
was
just
enough
air
to
keep
away
languor
she
turned
into
the
grounds
of
the
old
closed
royal
victoria
hotel
here
was
shade
and
greater
freshness
she
sat
down
on
the
rock
coping
of
the
driveway
then
as
there
was
no
one
about
lay
down
upon
it
pillowing
her
head
on
her
arms
above
her
was
a
tall
tall
tree
and
between
the
branches
the
deep
and
vivid
blue
it
seemed
so
near
it
was
as
though
with
a
little
upward
effort
you
might
touch
a
sapphire
roof
between
the
leaves
the
sun
scattered
gold
sequins
they
lay
upon
her
white
skirt
the
hat
she
had
discarded
her
arms
her
hair
she
looked
sideways
watching
a
chameleon
burnished
and
slender
upon
the
wall
below
her
it
saw
her
at
last
and
with
a
jerk
of
its
head
scuttled
away
hagar
laughed
sat
up
and
stretched
her
arms
some
neighbouring
house
buried
in
foliage
possessed
a
parrot
or
cockatoo
she
watched
it
now
on
some
hidden
perch
a
vivid
splash
of
colour
in
the
enfolding
green
dancing
about
chattering
and
screaming
some
curious
exotic
fragrance
came
to
her
she
could
not
trace
its
source
it
a
morning
for
the
gods
she
said
and
walked
slowly
by
winding
paths
downward
through
the
garden
to
the
street
before
her
seen
through
foliage
rose
the
curiously
shaped
building
with
a
history
where
now
was
lodged
the
public
library
she
had
visited
it
several
times
she
liked
the
place
which
had
a
quaintness
and
liked
the
way
the
air
blew
in
through
its
deep
windows
and
where
books
were
she
was
at
home
she
crossed
the
white
street
entered
and
went
up
the
stair
past
dusty
casts
pieces
of
coral
and
and
into
the
round
room
where
english
and
american
papers
and
magazines
were
spread
upon
a
table
from
this
centre
sprang
like
short
spokes
alcoves
made
by
the
each
of
these
divisions
had
its
chair
or
two
and
its
open
window
the
air
came
in
coolly
deliciously
there
were
the
librarian
and
two
or
three
people
standing
or
seated
about
the
central
table
no
one
else
in
the
cool
quiet
place
hagar
too
stood
by
the
table
for
a
while
turning
over
the
january
magazines
looking
at
the
table
of
contents
or
glancing
at
some
article
or
illustration

and
the
after
a
while
she
left
these
and
the
table
and
moved
to
one
of
the
alcoves
it
was
not
a
day
somehow
for
magazines
the
rows
of
books
her
gaze
lingered
with
fondness
upon
them
this
familiar
title
this
loved
old
friend
and
that
finally
she
drew
forth
a
volume
of
keats
and
with
it
sat
down
in
the
sweet
air
from
the
window
no
no
go
not
to
lethe
neither
twist
for
its
poisonous
wine
an
hour
passed
a
man
who
had
come
into
the
room
a
few
minutes
before
was
standing
looking
about
him
evidently
the
first
time
he
had
been
in
the
building
the
librarian
joined
him
it
a
pleasant
old
place
is
it
she
said
politely
it
certainly
is
answered
the
man
but
it
so
curious
with
that
narrow
stair
and
these
windows
yes
you
see
it
the
old
jail
once
they
kept
men
here
instead
of
books
there
was
a
pause
then
the
man
said
this
is
the
nobler
use
you
think
oh
said
the
librarian
but
of
course
they
were
wicked
men
that
is
most
of
them
there
was
anything
else
to
do
with
them
i
see
said
the
man
he
looked
about
him
well
it
sweet
and
clean
and
useful
now
at
last
some
one
called
the
librarian
and
she
went
away
the
man
moved
on
with
slow
steps
from
alcove
to
alcove
hagar
from
her
recess
watched
him
fascinated
her
book
had
fallen
upon
the
floor
with
half
of
her
mind
she
was
again
in
a
poor
hall
in
new
york
on
a
winter
night
five
or
six
people
entered
the
library
together
they
came
between
her
and
the
man
she
was
following
with
her
eyes
when
at
last
they
moved
from
before
her
alcove
she
saw
him
leaving
the
place
before
she
could
hastily
rise
and
come
out
into
the
wider
space
he
was
out
of
the
room
upon
the
landing
he
was
going
downstairs
she
caught
up
the
book
from
the
floor
thrust
it
hurriedly
into
its
place
and
with
a
light
and
rapid
step
followed
he
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
when
she
reached
the
head
oh
she
called
will
you
stop
will
you
wait
he
stopped
short
turned
she
was
halfway
down
the
stair
which
was
not
long
i
beg
your
pardon
was
it
to
me
you
were
speaking
yes
she
came
up
with
him
they
stood
together
in
the
doorway
i
you
do
not
remember
me
she
put
up
her
hand
and
took
off
her
wide
hat
of
straw
and
lace
do
you
now
he
gazed
no
yes
wait
oh
h
you
are
the
little
girl
again
they
both
laughed
with
pure
pleasure
a
soft
bright
swirl
of
feeling
enfolded
the
ancient
doorway
oh
she
said
i
have
so
often
thought
of
you
not
oftener
than
i
have
thought
of
you
you
always
been
like
a
quaint
bright
picture
and
a
piece
of
music
in
my
i
do
know
your
name
hagar
and
i
do
know
yours
denny
gayde
i
tried
to
find
you
in
the
crowd
that
night
the
night
of
the
meeting
you
remember
but
you
were
gone
yes
and
for
weeks
after
that
night
i
used
to
think
that
perhaps
i
might
meet
you
on
the
street
any
day
and
then
i
went
away
the
sun
was
dazzling
where
they
stood
people
too
were
coming
down
the
stairs
behind
them
let
us
go
somewhere
where
we
can
talk
said
hagar
the
gardens
over
there
have
you
time
i
here
on
a
holiday
i
came
yesterday
i
do
know
a
soul
and
i
was
lonely
i
all
the
time
there
is
they
crossed
the
street
passed
under
an
arch
of
blossoming
vines
and
entered
the
royal
victoria
garden
deserted
cool
and
silent
as
when
hagar
had
quitted
it
earlier
in
the
morning
built
high
above
the
ground
about
the
vast
trunk
of
a
vast
tree
was
a
square
railed
platform
reached
by
a
flight
of
steps
a
bench
ran
around
it
it
was
a
cool
and
airy
perch
chequered
with
shadows
of
leaf
and
twig
and
with
a
sight
of
the
azure
sea
the
two
mounted
the
steps
and
moving
around
the
trunk
to
a
angle
sat
down
no
one
at
all
seemed
near
for
solitude
it
was
much
like
a
tree
house
which
shipwrecked
they
might
have
built
on
a
desert
island
life
the
most
curious
thing
said
gayde
is
it
and
curiouser
said
alice
i
was
twelve
years
old
that
summer
we
shared
the
apple
turnovers
we
did
share
them
you
gave
me
i
was
nineteen
and
then
how
many
years
nine
is
it
that
night
at
that
socialist
meeting
when
you
spoke
what
were
you
doing
there
i
asked
about
you
i
got
to
know
well
many
of
the
people
who
were
there
that
night
but
no
one
could
identify
you
and
though
i
kept
you
in
mind
and
looked
for
you
too
i
could
never
find
you
again
i
was
spending
the
winter
in
new
york
that
night
we
had
missed
the
theatre
we
walked
down
fourth
avenue
and
across
we
were
seeing
new
york
at
night
a
crowd
was
going
into
that
hall
and
we
went
in
too
i
see
not
until
i
got
home
that
night
did
i
remember
that
i
did
not
know
your
name
and
in
a
month
i
was
upon
the
ocean
and
i
have
been
in
america
very
little
in
all
the
years
since
i
am
here
this
winter
with
my
father
and
you
she
regarded
him
with
dark
eyes
simple
and
serious
and
interested
as
the
eyes
with
which
as
a
child
she
had
regarded
him
above
her
flower
dolls
he
was
not
hungry
and
haggard
and
as
then
nor
was
he
as
he
had
been
the
night
of
the
socialist
meeting
somewhat
embarrassed
and
stumbling
strong
but
piteous
too
he
was
a
little
thin
and
worn
and
looked
as
though
he
had
been
ill
she
noted
but
he
was
quiet
at
ease
and
assured
there
needed
no
elaborate
process
in
telling
her
things
to
intuition
she
added
a
considerable
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
ways
and
means
to
heart
intellect
one
could
do
much
in
nine
years
she
knew
that
from
personal
experience
this
man
had
added
to
native
strength
education
experience
poise
and
significance
she
might
have
said
culture
only
she
had
grown
to
dislike
the
word
he
had
not
evidently
attained
to
wealth
as
wealth
is
counted
in
a
region
where
the
male
visitor
though
he
might
arrive
in
winter
garments
promptly
sloughed
them
off
for
fine
white
flannels
he
had
not
followed
custom
it
was
true
that
he
was
not
wearing
a
winter
suit
but
what
was
probably
a
last
summer
one
it
was
not
white
only
a
grey
business
suit
and
somewhat
worn
his
straw
hat
looked
new
he
was
his
face
was
at
once
the
face
of
the
boy
in
the
thicket
and
the
face
of
the
workman
talking
out
of
bitter
experience
to
other
workmen
and
a
new
face
too
a
judging
face
ascetic
rather
than
not
with
eyes
that
carried
a
passion
for
something
vaster
than
the
flesh
and
you
asked
hagar
again
but
he
had
fallen
into
a
brown
study
you
be
do
you
mean
that
you
are
hagar
ashendyne
the
writer
yes
hagar
ashendyne
the
writer
she
smiled
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
read
what
i
have
written
have
you
yes
i
have
read
what
you
have
written
read
it
and
cared
for
it
greatly
well
all
life
a
strange
encounter
and
that
true
enough
and
now
will
you
tell
me
about
yourself
his
eyes
smiled
back
at
her
let
me
see
what
is
there
to
tell
that
night
in
new
york
well
after
that
night
i
was
fortunate
in
the
work
i
got
and
i
rose
from
grade
to
grade
i
studied
hard
every
moment
i
could
get
i
read
and
read
and
read
i
became
secretary
to
a
certain
socialist
organization
i
have
been
for
some
years
a
socialist
organizer
lecturer
and
occasional
writer
in
the
summer
i
am
to
take
the
editorship
of
a
socialist
paper
behold
the
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
poor
how
long
are
you
going
to
be
in
nassau
a
whole
month
these
last
two
years
have
been
years
of
exacting
constant
work
and
there
a
prospect
of
the
same
continuing
i
thought
i
got
my
second
wind
and
then
i
came
down
suddenly
the
doctor
said
that
if
i
wanted
to
do
the
paper
justice
and
i
do
i
have
to
give
it
an
editor
who
could
sleep
so
he
and
rose
packed
me
off
rose
my
wife
rose
darragh
he
spoke
as
though
she
would
know
the
name
indeed
it
seemed
to
have
for
her
some
association
but
it
wavered
like
a
dream
she
could
not
fix
it
she
seemed
to
feel
how
long
she
had
been
away
from
america
out
of
touch
not
knowing
things
events
trendings
nine
years
she
said
again
uncertainly
so
much
happens
in
nine
years
yes
he
said
personal
life
changes
rapidly
with
everything
more
flexible
with
horizons
growing
wider
and
the
age
follows
and
changes
and
changes
changes
and
mounts
we
are
in
for
a
great
century
i
glad
to
be
alive
yes
i
am
too
presently
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
would
he
not
take
it
with
her
father
and
herself
no
he
would
not
do
that
but
leaving
the
great
tree
and
the
garden
they
walked
together
to
the
house
at
the
gate
in
the
wall
she
said
come
to
see
me
here
morning
if
you
will
i
should
like
you
to
come
and
go
as
you
please
thank
you
he
said
then
with
emphasis
that
is
what
when
i
was
nineteen
and
afterwards
i
called
you
in
my
mind
it
a
good
word
let
us
use
it
still
with
all
the
will
in
the
world
you
are
wonderful
to
me
hagar
ashendyne
i
am
glad
to
have
found
you
again
denny
gayde
that
night
suddenly
before
she
slept
she
placed
the
name
rose
darragh
a
feminist
a
socialist
agitator
and
leader
a
writer
of
vigorous
prose
sociology
economics
she
seemed
to
see
her
picture
in
some
magazine
of
current
life
a
face
rich
alert
and
daring
rising
on
a
strong
throat
from
a
blouse
like
a
peasant
chapter
xxv
hagar
and
denny
the
afternoon
sun
yet
made
a
dazzle
of
the
white
road
infrequent
trees
cast
infrequent
shadows
it
was
warm
but
not
too
warm
with
an
endless
low
wind
the
tide
was
going
out
there
spread
an
expanse
of
iridescent
shallows
and
beyond
a
line
of
water
so
blue
that
it
was
unearthly
there
was
a
tonic
smell
of
salt
and
marsh
the
wheels
of
the
surrey
the
horse
hoofs
brought
a
pleasant
monotonous
rhythmic
sense
of
sound
and
motion
that
is
the
shell
house
said
hagar
breaking
a
long
silence
that
small
small
house
with
the
boat
behind
there
you
can
buy
throngs
of
things
that
come
out
of
the
sea
coral
and
sponges
and
purple
and
wonderful
shells
i
walked
out
here
last
week
there
a
sick
child
i
know
a
little
cripple
i
am
going
to
take
her
a
great
box
of
the
prettiest
shells
she
lie
there
and
play
with
them
in
her
dingy
corner
of
the
dingy
room
where
all
the
others
work
and
maybe
they
bring
her
a
little
of
all
this
god
knows
the
wheels
went
on
they
passed
the
small
house
with
a
great
lump
of
coral
on
one
side
of
the
door
and
a
tall
purple
upon
the
other
i
sometimes
think
said
hagar
that
the
trouble
with
me
is
that
i
am
too
general
my
own
sharp
inner
struggle
was
for
intellectual
and
spiritual
freedom
i
had
to
think
away
from
concepts
with
which
the
atmosphere
in
which
i
was
raised
was
saturated
i
had
to
think
away
from
creeds
and
dogmas
and
affirmations
made
for
me
by
my
ancestors
i
had
to
think
away
from
the
idea
of
a
sacrosanct
past
and
the
virtue
of
immobility
not
the
true
idea
of
the
mighty
past
as
our
present
body
which
we
are
to
lift
and
ennoble
and
not
immobility
as
the
supreme
refusal
to
be
diverted
from
that
purpose
but
the
past
that
is
made
up
of
steps
forward
set
and
stubborn
against
another
step
and
immobility
blind
to
any
virtue
in
change
i
had
to
think
away
from
a
concept
of
woman
that
the
future
can
surely
only
sadly
laugh
at
i
had
to
think
away
from
sanctions
and
authorities
and
taboos
and
divine
rights
and
when
i
had
done
so
i
had
to
go
back
with
the
lamp
of
wider
knowledge
deeper
feeling
and
find
how
organic
and
on
the
whole
virtuous
in
its
day
was
each
husk
and
shell
the
trouble
was
that
in
love
with
the
lesser
we
would
keep
out
the
stronger
day
and
there
was
everywhere
a
sickness
of
conflict
i
had
to
think
away
from
my
own
dogmatisms
and
intolerances
i
still
engaged
in
doing
that
what
has
come
of
it
all
is
a
certain
universal
feeling
i
not
explaining
very
well
what
i
mean
but
though
i
want
to
be
able
to
do
it
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
drive
the
lightning
in
a
narrow
track
to
a
definite
end
it
playing
over
everything
i
see
what
you
mean
you
more
the
philosopher
than
the
crusader
well
we
need
philosophers
too
i
more
i
think
the
type
that
is
sharpened
to
a
point
that
couches
its
lance
for
one
promised
land
which
it
believes
is
the
key
to
many
another
but
i
hold
that
it
is
better
to
move
if
you
can
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
said
hagar
i
try
to
plunge
with
my
whole
mind
into
some
political
or
social
theory
but
i
fail
even
the
slow
of
the
submerged
capacities
in
woman
even
the
helping
in
that
which
is
greater
than
would
be
the
discovery
of
atlantis
which
is
greater
than
almost
anything
else
can
not
bring
the
ends
together
name
everything
and
there
is
so
much
besides
there
is
such
a
thing
said
denny
as
going
to
the
stake
for
what
you
know
to
be
partial
only
factors
scaffoldings
stairs
to
mount
by
stairs
and
scaffoldings
are
necessary
therefore
die
for
them
if
need
be
i
agree
there
answered
hagar
the
surrey
had
left
the
sight
of
the
sea
the
pale
road
stretched
straight
before
them
going
on
until
it
touched
the
cobalt
sky
on
either
hand
stood
growing
walls
dense
and
thorny
as
those
about
the
sleeping
beauty
palace
all
manner
of
trees
silver
palm
and
thatch
palm
tamarind
and
plum
and
bound
all
together
with
smilax
and
many
another
vine
at
long
intervals
occurred
an
opening
a
ragged
space
and
a
hut
or
cabin
with
an
odour
too
of
orange
blossoms
and
a
vision
of
black
children
the
walls
closed
in
again
sombrely
the
road
would
have
been
a
little
dreary
but
for
the
sky
and
the
sun
and
the
air
i
suppose
said
hagar
that
there
is
a
certain
attitude
to
be
overcome
i
suppose
that
to
take
wallet
and
staff
and
go
with
the
mass
upon
the
day
march
encouraging
lifting
helping
pointing
forward
bearing
with
the
others
is
a
nobler
thing
than
to
run
ahead
upon
your
own
path
and
cry
back
to
the
throng
are
you
not
here
as
well
i
suppose
that
and
yet
there
are
times
when
i
am
nietzschean
too
i
can
be
opposites
yes
that
is
what
bewilders
said
denny
to
include
contradictories
and
irreconcilables
to
be
both
centripetal
and
centrifugal
to
be
in
one
brain
socialist
and
individualist
but
the
greatest
among
mankind
have
found
themselves
able
they
have
been
farthest
ahead
and
yet
they
have
always
seemed
to
be
in
the
midst
the
sun
sank
low
the
white
road
grew
pallid
better
turn
presently
said
hagar
when
we
get
to
that
palm
how
wonderful
it
stands
against
the
sky
i
never
thought
that
i
should
see
palm
trees
when
they
came
to
it
the
negro
driver
turned
the
horse
roll
of
wheel
and
slow
thud
of
hoofs
they
went
dreamily
back
toward
nassau
the
walls
on
either
hand
were
darkening
the
sky
was
putting
on
a
splendid
dress
years
and
years
now
i
have
been
away
said
hagar
in
the
spring
i
am
going
home
home
to
to
gilead
balm
at
first
yes
i
think
then
i
do
not
know
i
have
been
away
so
long
there
are
people
in
new
york
i
want
to
see
old
friends
women
do
you
chance
to
know
elizabeth
eden
yes
i
know
her
she
one
of
the
blessed
after
a
moment
he
said
abruptly
i
want
you
to
know
rose
darragh
yes
i
want
to
said
hagar
simply
they
came
before
long
to
the
shell
house
let
us
stop
and
get
some
shells
inside
they
had
the
place
save
for
the
merchant
of
shells
to
themselves
right
and
left
and
all
around
were
strewn
the
pearl
and
pink
and
purply
spoils
all
the
sunset
tints
were
here
and
the
beauty
of
delicate
form
grotesqueries
too
nature
in
queer
moods
it
was
pleasant
to
run
the
hands
through
the
myriad
small
shells
heaped
in
baskets
to
weigh
the
and
and
golden
seafeathers
to
admire
rose
coral
and
brain
coral
and
finger
coral
and
hold
the
conch
shells
to
the
ear
through
the
open
door
too
came
the
smell
and
murmur
of
the
sea
and
on
the
floor
lay
one
last
splash
of
sunlight
give
me
a
shell
said
hagar
and
i
will
give
you
one
then
each
of
us
will
have
something
to
remember
the
other
by
they
gravely
picked
them
out
and
it
took
some
minutes
to
do
it
then
in
turn
each
crossed
to
the
merchant
in
his
corner
and
paid
the
purchase
price
then
came
back
to
the
light
in
the
doorway
denny
held
out
a
delicate
translucent
rosy
shell
it
wo
hold
my
gratitude
he
said
you
never
know
i
used
to
see
you
in
the
moonlight
between
me
and
the
bars
somebody
had
cried
for
me
wept
passionately
it
helped
to
keep
me
human
i
always
seen
you
with
a
light
about
you
this
is
your
shell
thank
you
i
shall
keep
your
kind
gift
always
said
hagar
she
spoke
in
a
child
lyric
voice
quaintly
and
properly
so
precisely
as
she
might
have
spoken
at
twelve
years
old
that
startled
herself
she
laughed
and
denny
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
laughed
too
oh
she
cried
with
something
like
a
sob
sixteen
years
to
slip
from
one
like
that
she
held
out
a
small
purple
shell
this
is
yours
denny
gayde
and
i
thought
of
you
often
and
wished
you
well
if
i
did
you
unknowing
a
service
so
you
unknowing
have
done
me
a
service
too
that
summer
morning
long
ago
it
shocked
me
awake
the
world
since
then
has
been
different
always
more
pitiful
and
nearer
your
shell
it
wo
hold
my
gratitude
and
either
they
passed
out
between
the
coral
and
the
entered
the
surrey
and
it
drove
on
now
they
were
back
by
the
sea
the
tide
was
far
out
the
expanse
of
shallows
vaster
the
salt
pools
had
been
fired
by
the
torch
of
the
sky
they
lay
in
reds
and
purples
wonderful
the
smell
of
the
sea
impregnated
the
air
and
there
blew
a
whispering
wind
the
town
began
to
appear
straggling
out
to
meet
them
low
chimneyless
houses
of
the
poorer
sort
men
and
women
were
out
in
the
twilight
and
children
calling
to
one
another
and
playing
the
vivid
lights
had
faded
from
sky
and
from
wet
sand
and
rock
shoal
and
lagoon
but
colour
was
left
though
it
was
the
ghost
of
itself
it
swam
in
the
air
it
gleamed
from
the
earth
warmth
was
there
too
and
languor
and
the
melancholy
of
the
gathering
night
a
dreamlike
quality
came
into
things
the
children
voices
sounded
faint
and
far
only
there
were
waves
of
some
faint
odour
coming
now
it
seemed
from
gardens
now
they
were
in
the
town
and
the
sea
was
shut
away
one
half
of
my
fairy
month
is
gone
you
are
sleeping
better
yes
much
better
where
shall
we
go
leave
it
to
look
at
the
star
oh
beauty
when
was
here
they
walked
inland
to
fort
fincastle
and
then
to
the
queen
staircase
negro
children
raced
after
them
with
some
yellow
flower
in
their
hands
penny
boss
penny
boss
penny
boss
when
they
were
gone
and
when
two
surreys
filled
with
hotel
people
vanished
likewise
they
had
the
staircase
to
themselves
cut
in
the
living
rock
it
plunged
downward
to
the
green
bottom
of
the
deep
ancient
quarry
trees
overhung
it
and
yellow
flowers
and
there
was
a
rich
green
light
like
the
bottom
of
the
sea
denny
and
hagar
sat
upon
a
step
a
quarter
of
the
way
down
i
do
not
know
why
said
denny
there
should
be
so
deadly
a
fear
of
upheaval
all
growth
comes
with
upheaval
surely
all
spiritual
growth
comes
so
growth
by
accretion
means
little
growth
from
within
comes
with
upheaval
what
you
have
been
transformed
or
discarded
a
little
higher
a
little
finer
breaks
the
sod
and
grows
forth
so
the
deadly
fear
should
be
of
from
the
stagnant
down
down
of
course
the
woman
movement
means
upheaval
and
great
upheaval
but
that
is
a
poor
reason
for
condemnation
as
far
as
its
political
aspect
is
concerned
most
men
socialists
and
others
with
whom
i
come
into
contact
admit
the
right
and
the
need
unless
a
man
is
very
stupid
he
can
see
what
a
farce
it
is
to
talk
of
a
democracy
government
of
the
people
for
the
people
by
the
people
when
one
out
of
every
two
human
beings
is
notoriously
living
under
an
aristocracy
and
of
course
we
who
want
an
associative
gain
of
livelihood
no
less
than
an
associative
form
of
government
stand
for
her
equality
there
but
to
me
there
is
something
other
than
all
that
in
this
upheaval
i
can
not
express
it
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
unless
it
is
some
faint
supernal
promise
it
is
as
though
the
spirit
were
again
working
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
he
paused
gazing
upward
at
the
sky
above
the
wall
of
rock
we
are
in
for
a
deep
change
yes
i
think
so
a
lift
of
mind
and
a
change
of
heart
on
which
to
base
a
chance
for
a
deep
change
indeed
a
richer
deeper
life
oh
there
will
be
dross
enough
for
a
time
tares
detritus
heat
and
dust
and
wounds
of
conflict
babel
cries
and
and
some
will
think
they
lose
they
only
think
so
for
a
while
nothing
can
be
lost
no
only
transmuted
but
i
hate
the
tumult
and
the
shouting
while
the
people
are
yet
bewildered
if
that
the
brahmin
in
me
i
am
going
to
sacrifice
him
i
am
going
where
the
battle
is
i
do
not
doubt
that
more
people
appeared
at
their
heels
the
black
children
penny
boss
penny
boss
penny
boss
hagar
and
denny
rose
and
walked
back
to
town
through
the
warm
fragrant
ways
he
left
her
at
greer
studio
she
had
promised
to
come
look
at
the
portrait
as
they
stood
a
moment
in
the
verandah
medway
golden
drawl
was
heard
from
within
well
i
known
a
good
many
philosophers
but
none
that
were
irreducible
every
heroic
every
transcendental
treads
at
last
the
same
pavement
love
and
seek
the
street
called
pleasure
i
abhor
and
avoid
the
street
called
pain
therefore
the
the
door
opened
to
hagar
she
smiled
and
waved
her
hand
and
the
studio
swallowed
her
up
some
days
after
this
they
drove
one
afternoon
over
the
blue
hills
to
the
southern
beach
long
white
road
long
white
road
and
on
either
hand
pine
and
scrub
pine
and
scrub
and
over
all
a
vault
of
sky
achingly
blue
it
was
a
lonely
road
a
road
untravelled
and
the
wind
shook
in
the
palmetto
scrub
small
grey
birds
flitted
before
them
or
cheeped
from
the
tangled
wood
it
was
a
day
for
silence
and
they
stayed
silent
so
long
that
the
negro
driving
who
was
afraid
of
silence
broke
it
himself
he
told
them
about
things
and
when
they
awoke
and
genially
answered
he
was
happy
and
talked
on
to
himself
until
they
too
were
talking
when
he
lapsed
into
silence
and
contentment
the
wind
blew
the
scrub
rustled
the
sky
was
sapphire
oh
sapphire
when
they
came
after
a
good
while
to
the
south
beach
they
left
the
surrey
and
the
horse
and
the
driver
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
that
fringed
the
beach
and
walked
slowly
a
long
way
over
the
firm
sand
it
stretched
a
silver
shore
the
sun
was
westering
the
great
sea
making
a
hoarse
profound
murmur
they
walked
in
silence
thinking
their
own
thoughts
before
them
in
the
sand
lay
an
old
boat
when
they
came
to
it
they
sat
down
upon
its
shattered
boards
with
the
sand
at
their
feet
and
the
grave
evening
light
stealing
up
and
mother
ocean
speaking
speaking
in
the
last
analysis
it
is
said
hagar
a
metaphysical
adventure
a
if
you
will
there
is
a
passion
of
the
mind
there
is
the
questing
soul
there
is
the
desire
that
will
have
union
with
nothing
less
than
the
whole
i
will
think
freely
and
largely
and
doing
that
under
pain
of
being
false
i
must
act
freely
and
largely
live
freely
and
largely
nor
must
i
think
one
thing
and
speak
another
nor
must
i
be
silent
when
silence
betrays
the
whole
and
so
woman
no
less
than
man
comes
into
the
open
there
is
something
that
broods
in
this
time
said
denny
i
do
not
know
what
it
will
hatch
but
something
vaster
something
nobler
hagar
let
the
warm
sand
stream
through
her
fingers
oh
how
blue
is
the
sea
√¶ons
and
√¶ons
and
√¶ons
ago
when
slowly
slowly
life
drew
itself
forth
from
such
a
sea
as
this
into
upper
air
when
amphibian
began
to
know
two
elements
how
much
richer
was
life
for
amphibian
how
great
was
the
gain
when
after
√¶ons
and
√¶ons
there
was
all
manner
of
life
in
woods
like
these
behind
us
or
in
richer
woods
and
one
day
dimly
dimly
some
primate
thought
and
her
children
and
grandchildren
a
little
little
more
consciously
thought
and
it
spread
to
that
tribe
how
strange
a
dawn
are
growing
away
from
the
we
are
growing
away
from
our
sister
the
gibbon
and
our
brother
the
chimpanzee
we
are
growing
we
are
changing
we
feel
the
heavens
over
us
and
a
strange
new
life
within
us
we
are
passing
out
we
are
coming
in
we
need
a
new
word
and
at
last
they
called
themselves
√¶ons
ago
and
now
and
now
on
the
human
plane
it
seems
to
me
that
we
may
be
immediately
above
that
region
she
took
a
pointed
piece
of
driftwood
and
drew
upon
the
sand
here
is
the
human
plane
and
here
above
it
is
another
plane
she
drew
a
diagonal
line
between
and
that
is
a
stairway
of
growth
from
one
to
the
other
and
we
are
turning
from
this
plane
the
lower
plane
and
coming
upon
that
stairway
and
down
it
to
meet
us
pours
like
a
morning
wind
like
the
first
light
in
the
sky
a
hint
of
what
may
be
like
that
ancestral
tribe
we
are
growing
we
are
changing
we
feel
a
strange
new
life
within
us
we
are
passing
out
we
are
coming
in
we
need
a
new
word
what
would
it
be
i
do
not
know
after
a
while
an
age
hence
maybe
when
the
light
is
stronger
we
will
coin
it
now
there
is
only
intuition
of
the
change
there
is
something
in
a
translation
i
was
reading
of
one
of
the
upanishads
he
who
discerns
all
creatures
in
his
self
and
his
self
in
all
creatures
has
no
disquiet
what
delusion
what
grief
can
be
with
him
in
whom
all
creatures
have
become
the
very
self
of
the
thinker
discerning
their
oneness
he
has
spread
around
a
thing
bright
bodiless
taking
no
hurt
sinewless
pure
unsmitten
by
evil
that
might
come
after
a
long
long
time
after
change
upon
change
the
great
sea
murmured
on
a
wild
white
bird
flew
across
the
round
of
vision
melted
into
the
sunset
and
each
change
is
greater
by
geometrical
progression
than
was
the
one
before
not
the
change
itself
but
that
into
which
the
change
leads
us
each
time
we
depart
at
right
angles
yes
i
think
so
and
the
movement
of
women
toward
freedom
of
field
and
toward
no
less
than
the
general
movement
toward
socialization
is
part
of
the
change
all
things
are
part
of
it
yes
it
is
part
she
rose
from
the
sand
the
sun
is
setting
they
walked
back
to
the
surrey
and
took
the
homeward
road
as
they
came
over
the
blue
hills
it
was
first
dusk
the
town
lay
before
them
and
above
it
swam
the
moon
full
and
opaline
how
many
days
have
you
now
just
seven
have
you
heard
from
rose
darragh
yes
she
been
doing
her
work
and
mine
too
she
begs
me
to
stay
another
two
weeks
but
i
must
not
there
is
no
need
i
am
perfectly
well
again
it
would
only
be
selfish
enjoyment
i
wish
it
were
possible
but
if
it
not
it
not
oh
how
large
the
moon
is
you
can
almost
see
it
a
globe
it
is
like
a
beautiful
lighted
japanese
lantern
where
will
we
go
afternoon
we
can
not
go
anywhere
afternoon
for
alas
i
have
to
go
to
a
at
government
house
but
the
next
day
we
might
go
to
old
fort
what
is
that
fragrance
those
strange
lilies
look
now
at
the
japanese
lantern
they
went
to
old
fort
and
came
back
in
the
warm
evening
light
driving
close
to
the
sounding
sea
five
days
now
said
denny
well
i
have
been
so
happy
that
night
hagar
could
not
sleep
she
rose
at
last
from
the
bed
and
paced
her
room
all
the
long
windows
were
wide
the
night
air
came
in
and
brought
a
sighing
of
the
trees
after
a
while
she
stepped
out
upon
the
gallery
that
ran
along
the
face
of
the
house
medway
room
was
down
stairs
and
away
from
this
front
she
had
the
long
silvered
pathway
to
herself
she
paced
it
slowly
up
and
down
wooing
calm
each
time
she
reached
the
end
of
the
gallery
she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
across
the
sleeping
town
that
lay
for
the
most
part
below
this
house
and
garden
to
where
she
could
guess
the
roof
of
the
small
inexpensive
half
hotel
half
where
denny
bided
when
after
a
time
she
discovered
that
she
was
doing
this
she
shook
herself
away
from
the
action
no
hagar
no
going
to
the
other
end
of
the
gallery
she
found
there
a
low
chair
and
sat
down
leaning
her
head
against
the
railing
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
something
in
the
place
and
in
the
balm
of
the
air
brought
back
to
her
those
days
and
nights
in
alexandria
so
long
ago
there
too
she
had
had
to
make
choice
i
could
love
him
here
and
now
love
him
love
him
in
the
old
immemorial
way
well
i
will
not
she
put
her
elbows
on
her
knees
her
chin
in
her
hands
darragh
rose
darragh
rose
it
struck
through
her
mind
slow
and
heavily
vibrant
like
a
deep
and
melancholy
music
she
rose
and
paced
the
gallery
again
but
when
she
came
to
the
farther
end
she
turned
without
pause
or
look
over
the
moonlit
town
darragh
rose
she
made
it
rhythmic
breathing
deeply
and
quietly
saying
the
name
inwardly
deeply
but
without
passion
now
saying
it
like
a
comrade
name
darragh
rose
darragh
rose
darragh
calm
came
at
last
repose
of
mind
victory
she
sat
down
again
leaned
her
arms
upon
the
railing
and
followed
with
her
eyes
the
lonely
silver
moon
work
was
in
the
world
the
work
and
beauty
was
in
the
world
the
beauty
and
one
good
put
out
of
reach
mind
and
spirit
must
make
another
and
were
equal
to
the
task
rose
darragh
rose
darragh
not
if
i
could
would
i
hurt
you
said
hagar
and
took
her
attention
from
that
matter
and
put
it
first
upon
the
stars
and
then
upon
some
lines
of
shelley
that
she
loved
and
then
upon
the
story
she
had
in
hand
it
was
not
well
to
go
to
bed
thinking
of
a
story
and
when
at
last
she
left
the
gallery
and
laid
herself
straight
upon
the
cool
linen
she
stilled
the
waves
of
the
and
let
the
barque
of
attention
drift
whither
it
would
at
last
she
seemed
in
a
deep
forest
long
ago
and
far
away
and
there
she
went
to
sleep
with
a
feeling
of
violets
under
her
hand
five
days
and
denny
left
nassau
it
not
saying
in
may
when
you
come
to
new
york
yes
in
may
i
see
you
and
rose
darragh
until
may
then
denny
and
she
clasped
hands
both
hands
thank
god
for
friends
he
said
with
the
odd
little
laugh
that
she
liked
with
the
catch
in
the
voice
at
the
end
of
it
as
though
he
had
started
to
laugh
and
then
life
had
come
in
his
eyes
were
misty
he
brushed
his
hand
across
them
you
are
dancing
before
me
he
said
apologetically
she
laughed
herself
and
you
are
dancing
before
me
denny
gayde
let
be
friends
always
from
the
garden
she
watched
the
miami
steam
slowly
down
the
narrow
harbour
and
passing
the
lighthouse
turn
to
the
open
sea
she
watched
it
until
it
was
but
a
black
speck
with
a
dark
feather
of
smoke
and
then
until
the
feather
and
all
had
melted
into
the
sky
well
she
said
there
work
and
beauty
and
high
cheer
and
time
that
smooths
away
most
violences
but
she
did
not
see
denny
and
rose
darragh
in
may
that
evening
at
dinner
medway
was
more
than
usually
good
company
he
had
a
high
colour
his
hair
and
curling
beard
had
been
cut
just
the
length
that
was
most
becoming
he
looked
superbly
handsome
often
he
affected
hagar
as
would
a
very
fine
canvas
some
portrait
by
titian
was
one
of
these
nights
greer
dined
with
them
and
he
was
urging
medway
as
he
had
urged
before
to
let
him
paint
him
fortune
smiling
on
us
both
on
you
as
well
as
me
neither
of
us
may
have
such
a
chance
again
let
me
ah
let
me
what
should
i
do
with
it
when
it
was
done
and
if
i
liked
it
which
you
know
greer
is
not
dead
certain
you
ca
hang
portraits
in
a
nomad
tent
and
i
have
a
soul
in
the
world
to
give
it
to
my
mother
would
like
a
coloured
photograph
of
me
but
she
would
like
greer
picture
unless
gipsy
will
take
it
when
she
sets
up
her
own
establishment
i
will
take
it
with
thanks
said
hagar
let
greer
do
it
medway
said
he
would
consider
it
dinner
went
off
gaily
with
stories
and
badinage
afterwards
the
traveller
from
the
colonial
came
in
and
then
the
violinist
he
played
for
them
played
rhapsodies
and
fantasias
it
was
after
eleven
when
the
three
guests
departed
gay
voice
could
be
heard
down
the
street

thomson
appeared
with
mahomet
behind
him
to
put
out
the
lights
sleep
right
said
medway
pleasant
fellows
are
they
toward
daylight
she
was
awakened
by
a
knock
at
her
door
followed
by
thomson
voice
ashendyne
has
had
some
kind
of
a
stroke
miss
hagar
she
sprang
up
threw
on
a
kimono
opened
the
door
and
ran
downstairs
with
thomson
i
heard
him
breathing
heavily
i
waked
mahomet
and
sent
the
black
boy
for
the
doctor
it
was
paralysis
and
after
months
of
nassau
she
took
him
back
to
the
mainland
and
northward
by
slow
stages
not
to
gilead
balm
for
he
made
always
no
with
his
head
and
eyes
to
that
and
not
to
new
york
for
he
seemed
impatient
of
that
too
but
at
last
to
washington
there
she
and
thomson
found
a
pleasant
residence
to
let
on
a
avenue
and
there
they
moved
him
and
there
she
stayed
with
him
two
years
and
read
a
vast
number
of
books
aloud
and
between
the
readings
cultivated
a
sunny
talkativeness
at
the
end
of
the
two
years
there
came
a
second
stroke
which
killed
him
chapter
xxvi
gilead
balm
it
a
foolish
piece
of
idealism
said
ralph
but
she
had
her
way
so
long
i
suppose
it
impossible
now
to
check
her
the
colonel
irritation
exploded
and
eyed
a
little
stooped
now
a
good
deal
shrunken
in
his
black
aristocratic
clothes
he
lifted
a
bloodless
hand
and
made
emphasis
with
a
long
forefinger
precisely
so
one
world
mistake
lay
in
ever
giving
property
unqualifiedly
into
a
woman
hands
and
another
in
ever
encouraging
occupations
outside
the
household
and
so
breeding
this
independent
attitude
an
attitude
which
i
for
one
find
the
most
intolerable
feature
of
this
intolerable
latter
age
i
opposed
the
married
woman
property
act
in
this
state
but
the
people
were
infatuated
and
passed
it
married
or
single
the
principle
is
the
same
it
is
folly
to
give
woman
control
of
any
considerable
sum
of
money
legrand
entering
the
gilead
balm
library
caught
the
last
three
sentences
she
smiled
on
the
two
gentlemen
and
took
her
seat
upon
the
sofa
money
and
women
are
you
talking
about
where
money
comes
in
said
legrand
i
always
act
under
advice
women
know
very
little
about
finance
and
their
judgment
is
rarely
to
be
trusted
just
so
my
dear
friend
it
is
not
in
the
least
spoke
the
colonel
that
i
am
acquisitive
or
that
it
will
make
any
great
difference
to
me
personally
if
medway
wealth
stays
in
the
family
or
no
what
i
am
commenting
upon
is
the
folly
of
giving
a
woman
power
to
do
so
foolish
a
thing
hagar
always
do
foolish
things
said
miss
serena
looking
up
from
her
mexican
drawnwork
i
do
quite
understand
yet
said
legrand
ashendyne
was
telling
me
in
the
big
room
yesterday
evening
and
then
some
one
came
in
dear
medway
will
left
her
without
proviso
all
that
he
had
as
was
quite
proper
said
ralph
the
colonel
to
the
contrary
well
the
principal
comes
to
considerably
over
a
million
dollars
the
cool
million
his
second
wife
left
him
by
her
will
and
the
settlement
she
had
already
made
upon
their
marriage
the
investment
is
altogether
it
would
make
hagar
not
an
extremely
rich
woman
as
riches
are
counted
nowadays
but
yes
certainly
for
the
south
a
very
rich
woman
but
now
comes
in
your
feminine
tender
conscience
hagar
refuses
to
put
on
black
said
miss
serena
i
do
see
that
she
got
a
tender
conscience
the
entire
amount
everything
that
came
from
the
fortune
she
turns
back
to
the
fund
which
the
second
wife
established
for
housing
she
states
that
she
agrees
with
her
stepmother
views
as
to
how
the
fortune
was
made
and
that
she
does
not
care
to
be
a
beneficiary
she
says
that
her
stepmother
had
evidently
given
thought
to
the
matter
and
preferred
that
form
of
and
that
her
only
duty
is
simply
to
return
this
million
and
more
to
the
fund
already
erected
and
from
which
it
was
diverted
for
cousin
medway
benefit
duty
exclaimed
legrand
i
do
see
where
comes
in
her
is
to
see
that
her
father
was
wise
for
her
if
he
was
content
there
surely
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
so
hagar
said
miss
serena
never
could
see
proper
distinctions
between
people
i
do
see
that
are
housed
so
badly
ralph
laughed
mirthlessly
yes
they
are
cousin
serena
scarcely
any
of
them
have
tiled
bathrooms
and
the
best
type
of
tub
and
very
few
have
libraries
that
accommodate
more
than
a
thousand
volumes
and
quite
a
number
do
without
nurseries
papered
with
scenes
from
mother
goose
and
as
they
all
for
that
kind
of
housing
preparing
to
move
in
just
a
little
preliminary
ousting
of
a
few
people
with
more
brains
and
money
and
in
they
go
cuckoos
laying
their
eggs
in
abler
folks
nests
this
is
the
age
of
the
cuckoo
how
absurd
said
miss
serena
gilead
balm
has
a
tiled
bathroom
nor
an
extremely
large
library
and
when
i
was
a
child
the
nursery
was
papered
at
all
but
we
are
perfectly
comfortable
at
gilead
balm
it
a
heinous
sin
discontent
with
your
lot
in
life
do
you
mean
asked
legrand
that
against
your
counsel
and
advice
hagar
is
really
going
headstrongly
on
to
do
this
silly
thing
apparently
so
she
is
said
the
colonel
of
age
there
again
was
a
mistake
to
let
women
come
of
age
perpetual
minors
legrand
laughed
colonel
you
are
not
very
gallant
the
colonel
turned
to
her
oh
my
dear
friend
you
not
the
modern
unwomanly
type
that
professes
to
see
something
degrading
in
the
subordination
that
god
and
nature
have
decreed
for
woman
gallant
that
just
what
i
am
knights
and
gallantry
were
for
the
type
vanishing
though
he
bowed
to
legrand
who
had
not
a
little
of
her
old
beauty
left
though
here
and
there
is
left
a
shining
example
legrand
used
her
fan
oh
colonel
there
are
many
of
us
who
like
the
old
ways
best
ralph
drummed
with
his
fingers
upon
the
table
to
come
back
to
hagar
hagar
herself
entered
the
room
she
was
dressed
in
white
she
was
a
little
thin
and
pale
for
the
last
weeks
had
been
trying
ones
habitually
she
had
a
glancing
way
of
ranging
from
an
appearance
of
youth
almost
girlish
to
a
noble
look
of
young
maturity
she
looked
her
years
but
looked
them
regally
once
the
colonel
would
not
have
hesitated
to
hector
her
miss
serena
peevishly
to
blame
what
she
could
not
understand
legrand
to
attempt
smoothly
to
put
her
down
all
that
seemed
impossible
now
there
was
about
her
the
glamour
of
successful
work
of
a
known
person
legrand
had
recently
purchased
a
who
who
and
had
found
her
there
hagar
author
gilead
balm
in
and
so
on
from
various
chronicles
of
the
realm
of
contemporary
literature
she
had
gathered
that
hagar
name
would
be
found
in
yet
more
exclusive
lists
than
who
who
of
course
all
in
the
room
had
read
much
of
what
she
had
written
and
equally
of
course
each
of
the
four
had
for
temperamental
reasons
spokenly
or
unspokenly
depreciated
it
but
all
knew
that
she
had
though
they
could
not
see
the
justice
of
her
having
that
standing
in
the
world
legrand
always
with
patrons
smoothly
brought
it
in
that
she
had
been
a
pupil
at
eglantine
none
of
them
knew
how
much
she
made
by
her
writing
it
was
to
be
supposed
it
was
something
seeing
that
she
was
coolly
throwing
away
a
million
dollars
there
was
likewise
the
glamour
of
much
absence
in
foreign
lands
the
undefined
feeling
that
here
were
novelties
of
experience
and
adventure
ground
with
which
she
was
familiar
and
they
were
not
of
experience
and
adventure
in
psychical
lands
they
took
no
account
but
it
was
undeniable
that
her
knowing
europe
and
asia
and
africa
added
to
the
already
considerable
difficulty
in
properly
expressing
to
hagar
how
criminally
foolish
she
was
being
added
to
that
there
was
something
in
herself
that
prevented
it
ralph
spoke
first
we
were
talking
hagar
about
your
idea
of
what
to
do
with
cousin
medway
money
here
are
only
kinspeople
and
old
friends
and
we
all
wish
that
you
would
do
it
and
think
that
there
come
a
day
when
you
be
sorry
the
colonel
leaning
back
in
his
chair
stroked
his
white
imperial
i
should
never
have
said
gipsy
that
you
were
the
sentimental
kind
hagar
kindly
eyes
that
had
travelled
from
her
cousin
to
her
grandfather
now
went
on
to
legrand
and
you
they
seemed
to
say
why
could
you
said
legrand
do
both
why
could
you
give
a
handsome
donation
give
a
really
large
amount
to
this
charity
and
then
why
not
feel
that
you
had
so
to
speak
the
rest
in
trust
and
give
liberally
so
much
a
year
to
all
kinds
of
worthy
enterprises
i
do
believe
the
most
benevolent
heart
could
find
anything
to
complain
of
in
that
hagar
eyes
went
to
miss
serena
you
ought
to
take
advice
said
miss
serena
how
can
you
know
that
your
judgment
is
good
hagar
gave
her
eyes
to
all
in
company
it
is
right
that
you
should
say
what
you
think
we
are
all
too
bound
together
for
one
not
to
be
ready
to
listen
and
give
weight
to
what
the
others
think
but
having
done
it
our
own
judgment
has
to
determine
at
last
has
it
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
right
to
do
what
i
am
doing
what
i
have
done
for
it
is
practically
accomplished
i
saw
all
necessary
lawyers
and
people
last
week
in
new
york
of
course
i
hope
that
you
come
to
see
it
as
i
do
but
if
you
do
not
still
i
hope
that
you
believe
that
i
am
right
in
doing
what
i
hold
to
be
right
and
now
do
let
talk
of
that
any
more
what
i
want
to
know
said
miss
serena
is
how
you
going
to
live
if
you
do
take
your
dead
father
support
hagar
looked
at
her
in
surprise
live
why
live
as
i
have
lived
for
years
upon
what
i
earn
i
did
suppose
you
could
do
what
you
earn
it
depends
some
years
more
some
years
less
i
have
published
a
good
deal
and
there
is
a
continuing
sale
england
and
america
together
i
am
good
for
something
more
than
ten
thousand
a
year
miss
serena
stared
at
her
a
film
seemed
to
come
over
her
eyes
the
muscles
of
her
face
slightly
worked
somewhere
about
thirty
years
ago
she
said
painfully
i
thought
i
write
a
book
i
thought
of
a
pretty
story
i
wrote
to
a
printing
and
publishing
company
in
richmond
about
it
but
they
wrote
back
that
i
have
to
to
have
it
printed
that
night
in
her
bedroom
plethoric
with
small
products
of
needle
and
miss
serena
drew
down
the
shades
of
all
four
windows
preparatory
to
undressing
she
was
upstairs
there
was
a
thick
screen
of
cedars
and
no
house
or
hill
or
person
who
could
possibly
command
her
windows
but
she
would
have
been
horribly
uneasy
with
undrawn
shades
ready
for
bed
she
always
blew
out
the
lamp
before
she
again
bared
the
windows
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
who
is
it
called
miss
serena
her
hand
upon
her
it
hagar
may
i
come
in
it
seemed
that
hagar
just
wanted
to
talk
and
she
talked
with
charm
of
twenty
things
mostly
of
happenings
about
the
old
place
she
asked
about
the
latest
panel
of
garden
lilies
and
and
she
took
the
wonderfully
embroidered
pincushion
from
the
bureau
and
admired
it
i
think
that
i
going
to
have
an
apartment
in
new
york
this
winter
and
if
i
do
wo
you
make
me
a
pincushion
and
aunt
serena
you
must
come
sometimes
to
see
me
you
be
marrying
you
ought
to
marry
ralph
even
so
you
could
come
to
see
me
could
you
but
i
am
not
going
to
marry
ralph
miss
serena
stiffened
the
whole
family
wants
you
to
she
was
upon
family
authority
and
the
wooing
had
to
be
done
all
over
again
i
saw
thomasine
in
new
york
she
going
to
live
with
me
as
my
secretary
you
know
that
she
has
been
a
typewriter
and
stenographer
for
a
long
time
and
they
say
she
is
an
excellent
one
she
has
been
studying
too
other
things
at
night
after
her
long
hours
she
is
as
pretty
and
sweet
as
ever
when
you
come
the
three
of
us
will
do
wonderful
things
together
miss
serena
bosom
swelled
i
wonder
when
ashendynes
and
dales
and
greens
began
to
things
by
which
i
suppose
you
mean
going
to
theatres
and
concerts
and
stores
and
such
things
together
the
bottom
rail
on
top
with
a
vengeance
in
these
days
but
your
mother
before
you
had
no
sense
of
blood
hagar
sat
silent
with
a
feeling
of
despair
then
she
began
again
her
subject
the
flower
garden
and
then
at
last
aunt
serena
tell
me
about
the
story
wanted
to
write
ralph
ralph
was
too
insistent
she
thought
he
found
her
the
next
morning
under
the
old
sycamore
by
the
river
and
he
proceeded
again
to
be
insistent
she
stopped
him
impatiently
ralph
do
you
wish
still
to
be
friends
or
do
you
wish
me
to
put
you
one
side
of
the
equator
and
myself
on
the
other
i
can
do
it
the
equator
an
imaginary
line
you
find
that
an
imaginary
line
can
change
you
into
a
stranger
hagar
i
used
to
getting
what
i
set
my
heart
and
brain
upon
so
was
a
gentleman
named
napoleon
bonaparte
he
got
it
up
to
a
certain
limit
i
do
believe
you
are
in
earnest
i
do
believe
you
have
ever
really
considered
and
i
intend
one
day
to
make
you
see
see
what
see
my
enormous
advantage
in
marrying
you
oh
you
man
see
that
you
love
me
how
you
mean
can
i
help
it
oh
you
featherless
biped
ralph
broke
in
two
the
bit
of
stick
in
his
hands
with
a
snapping
sound
i
mad
for
you
and
i
like
to
pay
you
out
you
are
more
remotely
ancestral
than
almost
any
man
i
know
come
come

this
and
talk
as
cousins
and
old
playmates
wall
street
left
and
who
is
going
to
be
president
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
hawk
nest
what
i
wanted
to
do
with
hawk
nest
was
to
fix
it
up
for
you
oh
ralph
ralph
i
should
laugh
at
you
but
i
feel
more
like
crying
the
pattern
is
so
she
rose
from
beneath
the
sycamore
i
going
back
to
the
house
now
he
walked
beside
her
do
you
remember
once
i
told
you
i
was
going
to
make
a
great
fortune
and
you
made
light
of
it
well
i
a
wealthy
man
and
i
shall
be
a
much
wealthier
one
it
grows
now
automatically
and
that
i
would
be
powerful
well
i
am
powerful
and
that
too
grows
oh
ralph
i
wish
you
well
and
if
we
do
define
wealth
and
power
alike
still
your
definition
is
your
definition
and
if
your
heart
desire
and
i
think
it
is
be
happy
in
your
desire
until
it
changes
and
then
be
happier
in
the
change
i
have
told
you
what
is
my
heart
desire
i
will
go
back
to
that
look
the
sumach
is
turning
red
yes
it
is
very
pretty
you
did
see
sylvie
maine
sylvie
carter
when
you
were
in
new
york
no
i
have
seen
sylvie
since
that
one
first
winter
there
i
wrote
to
her
when
i
heard
of
jack
carter
death
that
has
been
three
years
ago
now
she
is
a
very
beautiful
woman
and
much
sought
after
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
her
last
winter
yes
that
sumach
is
getting
red
autumn
coming
hagar
i
not
in
the
least
going
to
give
up
ralph
i
going
to
advise
you
to
use
your
business
acumen
and
recognize
an
unprofitable
enterprise
when
you
see
it
look
at
the
painted
ladies
on
that
thistle
i
enough
to
believe
that
a
man
can
a
woman
love
him
are
you
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
know
when
you
i
warn
you
that
the
equator
is
getting
ready
to
drop
between
when
they
passed
the
cedars
and
came
to
the
porch
steps
it
was
to
find
old
miss
sitting
in
the
large
chair
her
feet
firmly
planted
her
beside
her
and
her
glinting
did
you
have
a
pleasant
walk
she
asked
and
looked
at
them
with
a
certain
massive
eagerness
ask
hagar
she
may
have
answered
ralph
and
took
himself
into
the
house
they
heard
his
rather
heavy
footfall
upon
the
stair
hagar
sat
down
on
the
porch
step
ralph
has
doubtless
a
great
many
good
qualities
but
he
is
spoiled
now
old
miss
had
a
favourite
project
or
projects
and
that
was
matings
between
coltsworths
and
ashendynes
every
few
years
for
perhaps
two
centuries
such
matings
had
occurred
many
had
occurred
in
her
day
with
great
intensity
she
wanted
and
had
wanted
for
years
to
see
a
match
made
between
her
granddaughter
and
so
promising
nay
so
accomplishing
a
coltsworth
as
ralph
she
was
proud
of
ralph
proud
of
his
appearance
of
his
ability
to
get
on
in
the
world
and
make
money
and
restore
hawk
nest
of
his
judgment
and
knowledge
of
public
affairs
which
seemed
to
her
extraordinary
she
wanted
him
to
marry
hagar
and
characteristically
she
refused
to
admit
the
possibility
of
defeat
but
ralph
was
no
longer
quite
a
young
man
he
ought
to
have
been
married
years
ago
as
for
hagar
old
miss
loved
her
granddaughter
but
she
had
very
little
patience
with
her
she
was
not
patient
with
women
generally
she
thought
that
on
the
whole
women
were
a
poor
lot
maria
lived
for
old
miss
lived
on
one
side
in
space
of
her
own
core
of
an
atmosphere
of
smouldering
dull
resentment
if
maria
had
been
different
medway
would
have
lived
at
home
if
maria
had
known
her
duty
there
would
have
been
a
brood
of
grandchildren
to
match
with
broods
of
coltsworths
and
others
of
rank
just
under
the
first
if
maria
had
been
different
this
one
grandchild
would
be
throwing
a
million
dollars
away
and
failing
to
love
her
cousin
if
maria
had
been
a
wilful
piece
hagar
might
have
escaped
being
a
wilful
piece
old
miss
loved
her
granddaughter
but
that
was
what
she
was
calling
her
now
in
her
mind
a
wilful
piece
factors
that
counted
with
the
others
at
gilead
balm
hagar
very
actual
detachment
and
independence
name
and
prestige
and
personality
failed
to
count
with
old
miss
such
things
counted
in
other
cases
they
counted
in
ralph
case
but
hagar
was
of
the
younger
therefore
rightfully
subordinate
generation
and
she
was
female
ralph
was
of
the
younger
generation
also
and
as
a
boy
while
old
miss
spoiled
him
when
he
came
to
gilead
balm
she
expected
to
rule
him
too
but
ralph
had
crossed
the
rubicon
as
soon
as
he
grew
from
young
boy
to
man
some
mysterious
force
placed
him
without
trouble
of
his
own
in
the
conquering
superior
class
whose
dicta
must
be
accepted
and
whose
judgment
must
be
deferred
to
the
halo
appeared
about
his
head
he
came
up
equal
with
and
passed
ahead
of
old
miss
elder
generation
to
the
contrary
but
hagar
hagar
was
yet
in
the
class
that
was
young
and
could
know
she
was
in
the
class
of
the
poor
lot
she
was
a
wilful
piece
i
do
not
see
that
ralph
is
spoiled
said
old
miss
he
receives
a
natural
recognition
of
his
ability
and
success
in
life
he
is
a
very
successful
man
a
very
able
man
he
is
giving
new
weight
to
the
family
name
there
was
a
piece
in
the
paper
the
other
day
that
said
the
state
ought
to
be
proud
of
ralph
i
cut
it
out
said
old
miss
and
put
it
in
my
scrapbook
i
show
it
to
you
you
ought
to
read
it
i
do
see
why
you
are
proud
of
your
cousin
i
hope
i
may
what
are
you
knitting
grandmother
any
woman
might
be
happy
to
have
ralph
propose
to
her
and
any
woman
but
your
mother
daughter
might
have
some
care
for
family
happiness
and
advantage
oh
grandmother
would
my
unhappiness
in
truth
advantage
the
family
unhappiness
there
no
need
for
unhappiness
that
your
mother
again
ralph
is
a
splendid
man
you
ought
to
feel
flattered
i
believe
in
marrying
without
love
certainly
not
without
respect
but
when
you
see
it
is
your
duty
and
make
your
mind
submissive
you
can
manage
easily
enough
to
feel
both
that
the
trouble
with
you
as
it
was
with
your
mother
before
you
you
do
see
your
duty
and
you
make
your
mind
submissive
i
no
patience
with
you
grandmother
said
hagar
did
you
ever
realize
that
you
yourself
only
make
your
mind
submissive
when
it
comes
into
relation
with
men
or
with
ideas
advanced
by
men
i
have
never
seen
you
with
a
woman
old
miss
appeared
to
take
this
as
a
startling
proposition
and
to
consider
it
for
a
moment
then
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
mean
that
outraged
nature
must
be
itself
somewhere
else
annihilation
old
miss
needles
clicked
i
do
pretend
to
be
or
to
understand
literary
talk
what
moses
and
paul
said
and
the
way
we
always
done
in
virginia
is
good
enough
for
me
you
perverse
and
rebellious
as
maria
was
before
you
it
simple
obstinacy
your
not
caring
for
ralph
and
as
for
throwing
away
medway
million
dollars
there
ought
to
be
a
law
to
keep
you
from
doing
it
are
you
going
upstairs
my
scrapbook
is
on
the
fourth
shelf
of
the
big
closet
get
it
and
read
that
piece
about
ralph
chapter
xxvii
a
difference
of
opinion
but
the
great
gilead
balm
explosion
came
three
days
later
it
was
nearly
sunset
and
they
were
all
upon
the
wide
front
porch
the
colonel
old
miss
miss
serena
captain
bob
legrand
hagar
ralph
was
not
there
he
had
ridden
to
hawk
nest
but
would
return
it
had
been
a
beautiful
early
september
day
the
sky
high
and
blue
the
air
all
sunny
vigour
gilead
balm
sat
and
enjoyed
the
cool
golden
winey
afternoon
the
shadows
lengthening
over
the
hills
the
swallows
overhead
the
tinkle
of
the
it
was
not
one
of
your
families
that
were
always
chattering
the
porch
held
rather
silent
than
otherwise
legrand
could
indeed
keep
up
a
smooth
slow
flow
of
talk
but
legrand
had
been
packing
to
return
to
eglantine
which
would
open
in
another
week
and
she
was
somewhat
fatigued
the
colonel
pending
the
arrival
of
yesterday
newspaper
was
reviewing
that
of
the
day
before
yesterday
captain
bob
and
lisa
communed
together
old
miss
knitted
miss
serena
ran
a
strawberry
emery
bag
through
and
through
with
her
embroidery
needle
hagar
had
a
book
but
she
was
not
reading
it
lay
face
down
in
her
lap
she
was
hardly
thinking
she
was
dreaming
with
her
eyes
upon
a
vast
pearly
cumulus
cloud
coming
up
between
the
spires
of
the
cedars
a
mulatto
boy
appeared
with
the
ha
said
the
colonel
and
stretched
out
his
hand
there
was
a
small
table
beside
him
he
opened
the
bag
and
turned
the
contents
out
upon
this
then
began
to
sort
them
no
one
it
was
a
gilead
balm
way
claimed
letter
or
paper
until
the
colonel
had
made
as
many
little
heaps
as
there
were
individuals
and
had
placed
every
jot
and
tittle
of
mail
accruing
ending
by
shaking
out
the
empty
bag
he
did
all
this
captain
bob
had
only
a
county
paper
no
letters
for
old
miss
a
good
deal
of
forwarded
mail
for
legrand
the
colonel
own
letters
and
papers
for
hagar
the
colonel
handled
each
piece
glanced
at
the
superscription
put
it
in
the
proper
heap
he
shook
out
the
bag
then
gathering
up
legrand
mail
gave
it
to
her
with
a
smile
and
a
small
courtly
bow
miss
serena
rose
work
in
hand
and
took
hers
from
the
table
lisa
walked
gravely
up
then
returned
to
captain
bob
with
the
county
paper
in
her
mouth
the
colonel
shrunken
long
fingers
took
up
hagar
rather
large
amount
and
held
it
out
to
her
here
gipsy
the
last
time
for
many
a
day
that
he
called
her
gipsy
a
letter
slipped
from
the
packet
to
the
floor
bending
the
colonel
picked
it
up
and
in
doing
so
for
the
first
time
regarded
the
printing
on
the
upper
corner
in
five
days
to
the
equal
suffrage
the
envelope
turned
in
his
hand
on
its
reverse
across
the
flap
was
boldly
stamped
votes
for
women
colonel
argall
ashendyne
straightened
himself
with
a
jerk
hagar
what
is
that
how
do
you
happen
to
get
letters
like
that
answer
his
granddaughter
who
had
risen
to
take
her
mail
regarded
first
the
letter
and
then
the
colonel
with
some
astonishment
what
do
you
mean
grandfather
the
letter
from
my
friend
elizabeth
eden
i
wonder
if
you
do
remember
her
that
summer
long
ago
at
the
new
springs
the
colonel
forefinger
stabbed
the
three
words
on
the
back
of
the
envelope
you
do
have
friends
and
correspondents
who
are
working
for
why
not
i
propose
presently
actively
to
work
for
it
myself
apoplectic
silence
on
the
part
of
the
colonel
the
suddenly
arisen
storm
darted
an
electric
feeler
from
one
to
the
other
upon
the
porch
what
the
matter
demanded
captain
bob
something
the
matter
old
miss
who
had
not
clearly
caught
the
colonel
words
yet
felt
the
tension
and
put
in
an
authoritative
foot
what
have
you
done
now
hagar
who
been
writing
to
you
what
is
it
colonel
ralph
in
his
coming
through
the
hall
from
the
back
where
he
had
just
dismounted
felt
the
sultry
hush
what
happened
what
the
matter
hagar
get
me
a
glass
of
water
serena
breathed
the
colonel
he
still
held
the
letter
my
dear
friend
let
me
fan
you
exclaimed
legrand
and
moved
to
where
she
could
see
the
offending
epistle
votes
for
oh
hagar
you
surely
are
one
of
women
miss
serena
who
had
flown
for
the
water
returned
the
colonel
drank
and
the
blood
receded
from
his
face
the
physical
shock
passed
there
could
be
seen
gathering
the
mental
lightning
miss
serena
too
read
over
his
shoulder
votes
oh
hagar
laughed
a
cool
gay
rippling
sound
why
how
you
all
are
it
is
murder
and
forgery
is
the
word
so
strange
to
you
may
i
have
my
letter
grandfather
the
colonel
released
the
letter
but
not
the
situation
either
you
retire
from
such
a
position
and
such
activities
or
you
cease
to
be
granddaughter
of
mine
old
miss
enlightened
by
an
aside
from
legrand
came
into
action
she
does
mean
that
she
friends
with
those
brazen
women
who
want
to
be
men
what
that
she
says
she
going
to
work
with
them
i
believe
it
i
do
believe
that
even
of
maria
daughter
going
around
speaking
and
screaming
and
tying
themselves
to
houses
of
parliament
and
interrupting
policemen
if
i
believed
it
i
do
think
i
ever
speak
to
her
again
in
this
life
women
righters
and
abolitionists
doing
their
best
to
drench
the
country
with
blood
kill
our
people
and
bring
the
carpetbaggers
upon
us
wearing
bloomers
and
cutting
their
hair
short
and
speaking
in
and
wanting
to
change
the
marriage
service
yes
they
do
wear
bloomers
i
saw
one
doing
it
in
new
york
in
when
i
was
there
with
your
grandfather
and
she
had
short
hair
legrand
as
the
principal
of
a
school
for
young
ladies
always
recognized
her
responsibility
to
truth
she
stood
up
for
veracity
dear
ashendyne
it
is
not
just
like
that
now
there
are
a
great
many
more
suffragists
now
so
many
that
society
has
agreed
not
to
ostracize
them
some
of
them
are
pretty
and
dress
well
and
have
a
good
position
i
was
at
a
tea
in
baltimore
and
there
were
several
there
i
even
heard
women
in
virginia
women
that
you
think
ought
to
know
better
say
that
they
believed
in
it
and
that
sooner
or
later
have
a
movement
here
of
course
you
do
hear
that
kind
of
talk
but
i
can
assure
you
there
a
good
deal
of
it
of
course
i
myself
think
it
is
perfectly
dreadful
woman
place
is
the
home
and
we
can
surely
trust
to
the
chivalry
of
our
southern
men
i
am
sure
hagar
has
only
to
think
a
little
the
whole
thing
seems
to
me
so
so
so
miss
serena
broke
out
passionately
it
against
the
bible
i
see
how
any
woman
hagar
who
had
gone
back
to
her
chair
turned
her
eyes
toward
captain
bob
confound
it
gipsy
what
do
you
want
to
put
your
feet
on
the
table
and
smoke
cigars
for
hagar
looked
at
ralph
he
was
gazing
at
her
with
eyes
that
were
burning
and
yet
sullen
and
angry
women
i
suppose
have
got
to
have
follies
and
fads
to
amuse
themselves
with
at
any
rate
they
have
them
suffrage
or
bridge
it
does
much
matter
so
long
as
it
not
let
really
to
interfere
if
it
begins
to
do
that
we
have
to
put
a
stop
to
it
woman
i
take
it
was
made
for
man
and
she
have
to
continue
to
recognize
that
fact
good
lord
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
give
her
our
love
and
pay
her
bills
she
might
be
satisfied
all
having
spoken
hagar
spoke
i
should
like
if
i
may
to
tell
you
quietly
and
reasonably
why
her
eyes
were
upon
her
grandfather
i
wish
to
hear
neither
your
excuses
nor
your
reasons
said
the
colonel
i
want
to
hear
a
retraction
and
a
promise
hagar
turned
slightly
grandmother
do
said
old
miss
talk
to
me
when
you
wrong
you
wrong
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
maria
used
to
try
to
explain
and
then
she
stopped
and
i
was
glad
of
it
hagar
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
regarded
the
circle
of
her
relatives
she
felt
for
a
moment
more
like
maria
than
hagar
she
felt
trapped
then
she
realized
that
she
was
not
trapped
and
she
smiled
thanks
to
the
evolving
whole
thanks
to
the
years
and
to
her
eternal
self
pacing
now
through
a
larger
moment
than
those
moments
of
old
she
was
not
by
position
maria
she
was
not
by
position
miss
serena
before
her
quiet
and
fair
opened
her
fourth
dimension
inner
freedom
ability
to
work
personal
independence
courage
and
sense
of
humour
and
a
sanguine
mind
breadth
and
height
of
vision
tenderness
and
hope
her
waiting
friends
elizabeth
marie
rachel
molly
and
christopher
denny
rose
darragh
many
another
her
work
the
story
now
hovering
in
her
brain
what
other
and
different
work
might
rise
above
the
horizon
the
passion
to
help
help
largely
lift
without
thinking
if
it
were
or
were
not
her
share
of
the
weight
the
universe
of
the
mind
the
growing
spirit
and
the
wings
of
the
morning
there
was
her
land
of
escape
real
as
the
hills
of
gilead
balm
she
crossed
the
border
with
ease
she
was
not
trapped
even
now
her
subtle
self
was
serenely
over
and
the
hagar
ashendyne
appearing
to
others
upon
this
porch
was
not
chained
there
was
not
riveted
to
gilead
balm
next
week
indeed
she
would
be
gone
a
tenderness
came
over
hagar
for
her
people
all
her
childhood
was
surrounded
by
them
they
were
dear
deep
among
the
roots
of
things
she
wanted
to
talk
to
them
she
longed
that
they
should
understand
if
you
listen
she
said
perhaps
you
see
it
a
little
differently
the
colonel
spoke
with
harshness
there
is
no
need
to
see
it
differently
it
is
you
who
should
see
it
differently
it
comes
of
the
kind
of
things
you
always
read
cried
miss
serena
books
that
i
would
touch
yes
maria
was
always
reading
too
said
old
miss
for
her
it
less
hagar
than
maria
sitting
there
if
it
was
anything
we
did
know
we
would
of
course
listen
to
you
hagar
dear
said
legrand
i
should
be
glad
to
listen
anyhow
just
as
i
listened
to
those
two
women
in
baltimore
but
i
must
say
their
arguments
sounded
to
me
very
foolish
ladies
in
the
south
certainly
do
need
to
come
into
contact
with
the
horrors
they
talked
about
and
i
can
not
consider
the
discussion
of
such
subjects
delicate
i
should
certainly
consider
it
disastrous
if
my
girls
at
eglantine
gained
any
such
knowledge
to
talk
about
their
being
white
slaves
and
things
like
that
it
was
nauseating
would
you
listen
ralph
asked
hagar
i
listen
to
you
hagar
on
any
other
subject
but
this
legrand
voice
came
in
again
she
was
fluttering
her
fan
all
these
theories
that
you
women
are
advancing
nowadays
if
they
if
you
stood
to
gain
anything
by
them
if
by
advancing
them
you
did
so
it
seems
to
me
always
come
out
at
the
little
end
of
the
horn
people
ridiculing
you
society
raising
its
eyebrows
men
afraid
to
marry
you
my
dear
hagar
men
collectively
speaking
men
want
women
to
exhibit
mind
in
all
directions
they
do
object
to
their
showing
it
in
certain
directions
but
when
it
comes
to
women
showing
it
all
around
the
circle
they
do
object
and
from
my
point
of
view
quite
properly
men
naturally
require
a
certain
complaisance
and
deference
from
women
there
no
need
to
overdo
it
but
a
certain
amount
of
physical
and
mental
dependence
they
certainly
do
want
well
what
the
use
of
a
woman
quarrelling
with
the
world
as
made
between
doing
without
independent
thinking
and
doing
without
an
establishment
and
someone
to
provide
for
you
so
you
see
said
legrand
smoothly
argumentative
what
the
use
of
stirring
up
the
bottoms
of
things
and
it
is
as
though
we
were
really
fond
of
the
men
we
are
i
always
been
fonder
of
a
man
every
time
than
of
a
woman
i
must
confess
i
ca
see
any
reason
at
all
for
all
this
strenuous
crying
out
against
good
old
usage
of
course
a
woman
with
considerable
mental
power
may
find
it
a
little
limiting
but
there
are
a
lot
of
women
i
assure
you
who
never
think
of
it
if
a
little
humbug
and
if
some
women
suffer
why
those
things
are
in
the
dish
that
all
the
dish
is
all
poisoned
and
a
woman
who
knows
what
she
is
about
can
pick
and
choose
and
turn
everything
to
account
i
would
know
what
to
do
said
legrand
with
the
dish
that
people
like
you
would
set
before
us
all
this
crying
out
about
evolution
and
development
and
higher
forms
does
touch
me
in
the
least
i
like
the
forms
we
got
perhaps
they
imperfect
but
the
thing
is
i
feel
at
home
with
imperfection
she
leaned
back
in
good
humour
hagar
had
given
her
an
opportunity
to
express
herself
very
well
do
you
too
she
asked
feel
at
home
with
the
dear
old
imperfection
hagar
met
her
eyes
no
she
said
legrand
shrugged
oh
well
she
said
i
suppose
each
will
fight
for
the
place
that
is
home
hagar
looked
beyond
her
to
her
kindred
you
all
opponents
she
said
alike
you
worship
god
as
man
and
you
worship
a
static
god
never
to
be
questioned
nor
surpassed
you
have
shut
an
iron
door
upon
yourselves
one
day
you
who
shut
it
you
alone
you
will
open
it
you
alone
but
i
see
that
the
day
is
somewhat
far
she
rose
i
was
going
anyhow
you
know
grandfather
in
four
days
but
i
can
take
the
morning
train
if
you
rather
but
colonel
ashendyne
said
stiffly
that
if
she
had
forgotten
her
duty
he
had
not
his
and
that
the
hospitality
of
gilead
balm
would
be
hers
of
course
for
the
four
days
hagar
listened
to
him
and
then
she
looked
once
more
around
the
circle
a
smile
hovered
on
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
it
broadened
became
warm
and
sweet
i
accept
for
a
time
the
partial
estrangement
but
i
do
ever
mean
that
it
shall
be
complete
it
takes
two
to
make
an
estrangement
she
went
up
to
her
grandmother
and
kissed
her
then
said
that
she
was
going
for
a
no
ralph
you
are
not
coming
with
me
she
went
down
the
porch
steps
and
moved
away
in
the
evening
glow
the
black
cedars
swallowed
her
up
then
upon
the
other
side
beyond
the
gate
she
was
seen
mounting
the
hill
to
the
right
the
sun
was
down
but
the
hilltop
rested
against
air
and
above
it
swam
the
evening
star
ralph
spoke
with
a
certain
grim
fury
i
wish
the
old
times
were
back
then
a
man
could
do
what
he
wished
then
you
did
feel
yourself
caught
in
a
net
like
a
cobweb
that
you
could
break
legrand
again
opened
her
fan
i
am
very
fond
of
course
of
dear
hagar
but
i
must
say
that
she
seems
to
me
intensely
unwomanly
chapter
xxviii
new
york
again
it
seemed
strange
to
be
back
at
the
maines
staying
a
fortnight
with
rachel
while
the
apartment
was
being
looked
for
nothing
had
been
moved
in
that
house
it
was
all
just
the
same
only
the
tone
of
time
was
deeper
the
furniture
more
worn
the
prints
yellower
she
asked
for
and
was
given
the
back
room
again
though
indeed
maine
protested
that
now
that
she
was
famous
bessie
had
changed
as
little
as
the
house
more
grey
hairs
somewhat
more
flesh
a
great
many
more
pounds
of
chocolate
creams
to
her
credit
that
seemed
all
she
was
still
amiable
sleepily
agreeable
comely
and
lazy
powhatan
except
to
grow
greyer
and
leaner
had
not
altered
either
the
old
servants
held
on
with
some
inevitable
variations
the
same
people
came
in
the
evenings
the
bishop
nephew
and
the
timothy
people
and
powhatan
downtown
acquaintances
and
chance
visitors
from
the
other
side
of
mason
and
dixon
she
noticed
a
slight
difference
in
the
cast
of
talk
they
all
seemed
uneasily
aware
that
the
world
was
moving
mostly
they
disapproved
and
foreboded
she
cast
her
mind
back
to
that
winter
of
it
had
been
the
terrible
winter
of
unemployment
strikes
widespread
discontent
she
remembered
clearly
how
powhatan
had
declaimed
then
against
upsetters
and
what
the
country
was
coming
to
but
now
she
heard
him
and
the
bishop
nephew
agree
that
and
ruin
were
modern
inventions
they
sighed
for
the
halcyon
past
even
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
sir
men
were
content
enough
rachel
rachel
had
not
sat
still
rachel
had
climbed
she
was
the
old
rachel
but
sweetened
and
broadened
there
was
left
something
of
her
old
manner
she
had
her
broodings
that
to
the
casual
eye
seemed
at
the
end
of
long
silences
she
might
flare
out
send
at
table
or
elsewhere
a
flaming
unexpected
arrow
but
her
old
ways
were
like
old
clothes
kept
worn
from
habit
while
all
the
time
a
fairer
more
lately
woven
garment
was
in
the
wardrobe
she
looked
no
older
she
was
slight
and
brown
and
somehow
velvety
hagar
called
her
a
pansy
she
was
no
longer
tragic
or
tragedy
had
become
but
a
dim
background
a
remembered
cloud
and
she
was
the
strong
sane
and
actual
comrade
of
her
children
betty
and
charley
charley
was
blind
charley
and
betty
had
changed
changed
more
than
anybody
betty
stood
a
frank
straight
young
diana
what
she
said
and
did
ringing
true
charley
was
the
student
he
had
his
shelves
of
braille
and
his
mother
eyes
and
voice
were
his
at
call
just
now
they
were
doing
general
history
together
that
was
what
charley
wanted
to
be
a
historian
charley
and
betty
claimed
hagar
for
their
own
there
were
her
christmas
letters
every
year
wonderful
letters
and
her
christmas
gifts
small
choice
things
from
every
land
they
worshipped
her
too
with
frankness
because
she
had
done
something
because
her
name
counted
oh
they
were
very
ambitious
betty
and
charley
filled
with
ideas
glorious
for
the
new
time
ready
to
push
the
world
with
vigour
oh
cried
hagar
do
they
make
you
feel
timid
cautious
and
conservative
she
watched
with
interest
to
see
what
effect
the
two
had
upon
powhatan
and
bessie
she
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
they
had
very
little
they
angered
powhatan
sometimes
and
he
would
strike
the
table
and
deplore
the
days
of
silent
reverence
but
he
was
desperately
proud
of
betty
looks
and
he
had
an
odd
sneaking
pity
and
fondness
for
charley
and
hagar
gathered
that
he
would
have
sadly
missed
them
out
of
the
house
as
for
bessie
she
only
gave
her
sleepy
smile
and
said
that
all
children
talked
foolishly
but
that
you
did
have
to
listen
upstairs
at
bedtime
now
in
rachel
room
now
in
hagar
the
two
talked
together
daytime
they
looked
for
hagar
apartment
they
found
it
at
last
high
in
air
overlooking
the
great
city
roofs
and
roofs
and
roofs
at
a
hundred
levels
curling
streamers
of
white
steam
like
tossed
plumes
against
the
blue
sky
bright
pennants
floating
from
towering
hotel
or
department
store
a
clock
below
a
church
spire
with
a
gilt
far
above
blurs
of
occasional
trees
seen
in
some
hollow
opening
streets
far
below
them
crossing
crossing
percolating
rivulets
of
manikins
that
were
people
roofs
and
roofs
and
roofs
and
a
low
perpetual
multitudinous
voice
and
the
sky
over
all
high
and
clear
and
exhilarating
the
day
they
found
the
place
i
am
going
to
utter
a
bromide
said
hagar
how
marvellous
is
modern
life
they
went
over
it
again
thomasine
room
and
a
and
my
room
and
a
fine
room
for
mary
magazine
who
is
coming
isham
having
remarried
to
look
after
us
and
two
baths
and
a
great
big
and
a
little
room
for
what
we
please
and
plenty
of
closets
and
a
quiet
and
good
caf√©
away
up
on
the
roof
rachel
it
fine
they
sat
on
a
and
rachel
produced
a
pencil
and
notebook
and
together
they
tinted
the
walls
and
laid
rugs
and
hung
pictures
and
ran
bookshelves
around
and
furnished
the
apartment
there
that
quiet
and
perfect
and
not
expensive
as
thomson
would
say
quite
il
miss
where
is
thomson
greer
the
artist
has
taken
him
over
he
wrote
me
that
he
was
making
thousands
throwing
the
light
on
millionaires
and
especially
millionairesses
and
that
he
wanted
thomson
oh
so
badly
he
the
type
that
thomson
likes
and
so
he
joined
him
two
months
ago
at
newport
dear
old
thomson
mahomet
has
gone
back
to
alexandria
they
looked
around
the
big
room
soft
lights
at
night
and
all
those
twinkling
stars
out
there
it
going
to
be
a
dear
home
you
have
people
coming
about
you
your
own
sort
hagar
laughed
what
is
my
sort
everybody
my
sort
writers
artists
hagar
pondered
the
with
a
view
to
what
should
go
above
it
i
do
know
many
of
them
i
know
more
of
them
abroad
than
here
we
a
very
isolated
kind
of
craftspeople
each
of
us
more
or
less
on
a
little
robinson
crusoe
island
of
our
own
it
may
be
different
in
new
york
i
do
know
we
could
do
a
good
deal
if
we
put
our
heads
together
and
push
the
same
wheel
the
apartment
was
not
to
be
furnished
in
a
day
they
worked
at
it
in
a
restful
and
leisurely
manner
and
in
the
midst
of
operations
hagar
went
to
see
the
josslyns
who
had
a
house
up
on
the
sound
that
afternoon
she
and
the
josslyns
walked
by
the
water
and
watched
the
white
sails
gliding
by
the
green
and
rocky
shore
then
in
the
evening
sat
by
a
wood
fire
with
cider
and
apples
monday
to
friday
the
children
were
in
town
at
their
grandmother
going
to
school
friday
afternoon
they
entered
the
big
like
a
west
wind
and
danced
about
with
their
mother
a
little
later
the
whole
family
would
go
into
town
christopher
had
had
a
course
of
lectures
to
write
and
he
was
doing
it
better
here
the
fire
crackled
and
blazed
at
night
through
the
open
windows
came
in
a
dim
sound
of
waves
with
passing
lights
of
boats
and
the
fragrance
of
the
salt
sea
beloved
by
hagar
on
monday
when
the
children
had
gone
she
drove
with
molly
deep
into
the
sweet
countryside
and
the
two
talked
as
the
quiet
old
horse
jogged
along
molly
had
taken
the
advice
of
the
woman
at
roger
three
years
and
more
ago
she
was
an
active
member
of
a
suffrage
organization
deeply
interested
beginning
to
speak
i
a
good
sort
my
voice
carries
and
i
do
have
to
strain
it
of
course
we
just
beginning
speaking
i
have
half
the
intellect
i
wish
i
had
but
i
can
give
them
good
plain
doctrine
it
so
after
all
and
christopher
helps
so
much
oh
hagar
when
you
truly
mated
it
molly
could
tell
much
of
the
practical
working
of
the
everyday
effort
and
propaganda
in
two
weeks
we
be
back
in
town
and
then
if
let
me
take
you
here
and
there
and
when
we
get
back
to
the
house
show
you
what
i
have
of
the
literature
we
use
pamphlets
leaflets
and
so
on
from
john
stuart
mill
down
to
an
article
christopher
wrote
the
other
day
we
broadcast
a
great
amount
of
it
in
every
state
but
if
we
were
rich
we
could
make
use
of
a
thousand
times
more
but
not
rich
whether
that
to
our
damnation
or
our
salvation
we
have
to
make
devotion
do
instead
then
there
are
the
books
that
help
us
and
they
are
coming
out
constantly
now
and
every
now
and
then
we
gain
a
bit
of
the
press
a
number
of
the
magazines
help
no
end
and
of
course
we
speak
and
have
meetings
and
work
quietly
each
among
her
own
acquaintance
it
to
educate
educate
educate
we
just
at
the
beginning
of
things
there
were
the
early
stages
and
the
heroic
women
who
blazed
the
trail
they
all
going
miss
anthony
died
last
march
and
their
time
is
merging
into
our
time
and
now
the
a
roadway
and
there
are
thousands
on
it
and
still
we
just
at
the
beginning
molly
could
tell
too
something
of
the
personality
of
the
women
eminent
in
the
movement
the
really
eminent
are
not
always
those
whose
names
the
reporters
catch
and
and
while
the
papers
talk
of
i
do
not
think
that
in
the
man
sense
they
are
leaders
at
all
we
do
not
hurrah
for
any
woman
as
the
men
do
for
roosevelt
or
bryan
the
movement
goes
without
high
priests
and
autocrats
and
personifications
we
have
i
suppose
the
big
chief
tradition
perhaps
woman
individualism
has
a
value
after
all
like
religion
when
it
really
is
personal
your
idea
of
good
remains
your
idea
of
good
it
does
take
on
a
human
form
or
perhaps
merely
tired
of
crooking
the
knee
i
do
know
the
fact
remains
they
jogged
along
by
country
roads
and
orchards
it
the
most
thing
said
molly
nobody
can
explain
it
but
every
one
who
takes
hold
of
it
feels
it
i
heard
a
woman
say
the
other
day
that
it
was
like
going
out
of
a
close
room
into
ozone
and
wind
and
the
blue
lift
of
the
sky
she
said
she
felt
as
though
she
had
wings
discouragements
cartloads
of
them
but
somehow
they
do
matter
nor
do
mistakes
of
course
we
make
them
but
the
next
time
we
do
better
the
witching
autumn
week
with
the
josslyns
over
hagar
went
back
to
town
and
as
she
had
promised
to
the
settlement
for
three
days
the
settlement
the
first
day
she
had
seen
it
came
back
clearly
the
harsh
biting
day
and
the
search
for
thomasine
and
omega
street
and
then
how
wonderful
the
old
house
had
seemed
to
her
going
over
it
with
elizabeth
it
was
shrunken
now
of
course
in
size
and
marvel
but
it
was
still
a
grave
and
pleasant
place
of
fine
uses
she
had
visited
it
before
during
this
month
and
she
had
marked
certain
changes
a
few
of
the
people
in
residence
years
before
were
here
yet
others
were
gone
others
of
later
years
had
come
in
but
it
was
not
only
people
other
changes
appeared
she
found
exhibited
a
deep
skepticism
of
certain
dana√Ødes
labours
still
favoured
or
tolerated
so
many
years
ago
the
policies
of
the
place
were
bolder
and
larger
every
one
was
at
once
more
radical
and
more
serene
marie
caton
met
her
elizabeth
has
a
committee
meeting
and
then
she
speaks
at
cooper
union
in
the
sweated
i
have
had
you
to
myself
hardly
ever
now
i
going
to
ca
i
go
to
cooper
union
oh
yes
i
going
too
it
an
important
meeting
but
i
got
you
for
a
whole
two
hours
and
nowadays
that
a
long
and
restful
sojourn
together
get
your
things
off
and
we
take
possession
of
in
elizabeth
room
with
her
books
with
the
psyche
and
the
botticelli
judith
and
the
mona
lisa
and
the
drawing
of
the
sphinx
they
talked
of
twenty
things
finally
of
the
settlement
specific
activities
old
ones
carried
on
new
ones
embarked
in
then
but
more
and
more
you
get
drawn
or
i
get
drawn
into
the
ocean
of
china
awake
china
awake
women
awake
it
an
ocean
all
right
with
an
ocean
possibilities
i
do
think
it
women
only
who
are
waking
marie
women
and
men
all
of
us
i
agree
said
marie
but
it
was
just
natural
with
women
they
been
drugged
given
drops
so
to
speak
they
have
a
long
way
to
wake
up
hagar
mused
her
eyes
upon
the
drawing
yes
a
good
long
way
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
pristine
strength
well
it
coming
out
all
kinds
of
things
are
coming
out
with
an
accent
on
qualities
they
did
think
she
had
yes
the
world
rather
in
the
position
of
the
hen
with
the
duckling
the
kind
of
thing
we
read
and
hear
at
this
place
emphasizes
of
course
the
economic
and
sociological
side
it
to
be
the
century
of
fair
distribution
of
social
organization
of
humanism
woman
also
which
of
course
is
all
right
but
i
put
an
infinite
plus
to
that
and
elizabeth
oh
elizabeth
is
a
saint
what
she
thinks
of
is
the
sweated
woman
and
the
little
children
and
the
girl
who
goes
under
most
often
is
pushed
under
it
what
we
see
down
here
it
the
starved
bodies
and
minds
the
slow
dying
of
fatigue
the
monstrous
wrong
of
the
things
withheld
that
moving
her
of
course
we
all
think
of
that
how
can
any
thinking
woman
not
think
of
that
she
wants
the
vote
to
use
as
a
lever
and
so
do
i
and
so
do
you
but
behind
all
that
in
the
place
where
i
myself
live
said
marie
with
sudden
passion
i
am
fighting
to
be
myself
i
am
fighting
for
that
same
right
for
the
other
woman
i
am
fighting
for
plain
recognition
of
an
equal
humanity
there
was
a
crowd
that
night
at
cooper
union
elizabeth
spoke
a
grave
strong
talk
followed
with
attention
clapped
with
sincerity
after
her
there
spoke
an
of
man
women
have
got
to
unionize
they
got
to
learn
to
keep
step
they
got
to
learn
that
the
good
of
one
is
wrapped
up
in
the
good
of
all
they
got
to
learn
to
strike
they
got
to
learn
to
strike
not
only
for
themselves
but
for
the
others
they
got
to
get
off
their
little
islands
and
think
in
terms
of
continents
they
got
to
get
an
idea
of
solidarity
when
he
had
taken
his
seat
came
an
announcement
made
with
evident
satisfaction
we
did
not
know
it
until
a
few
minutes
ago
we
thought
she
was
still
in
the
west
but
we
are
so
fortunate
as
to
have
with
us
rose
darragh
applause

darragh

and

the
meeting

hagar
went
denny
had
written
that
the
two
lived
handy
to
their
work
and
it
was
apparent
that
they
did
the
flat
had
the
dignity
of
spartan
simplicity
in
it
rose
darragh
moved
with
the
fire
of
the
ruby
denny

to
go
about
the
paper

denny
very
much
did
you
in
nassau
three
years
ago
yes
i
did
they
were
sitting
in
the
plain
bare
room
attractive
for
it
was
so
clean
the
late
autumn
sunlight
streaming
in
at
the
curtainless
windows
yes
i
did
i
liked
him
so
well
that
i
had
somewhat
of
a
fight
with
myself
i
am
telling
you
that
said
hagar
because
i
want
your
friendship
it
is
over
now
nor
do
i
think
it
will
come
again
rose
darragh
gave
her
a
swift
look
from
heel
to
head
that
strength
i
like
strength
all
right
i
not
afraid
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
i
wish
you
tell
me
said
hagar
about
your
work
a
very
few
days
after
this
she
took
possession
of
the
apartment
and
at
once
made
it
a
home
there
was
a
housewarming
with
rachel
and
betty
and
charley
and
elizabeth
and
marie
and
the
josslyns
and
two
pleasant
gentlemen
her
publishers
and
a
or
two
whom
she
was
by
way
of
knowing
and
liking
and
an
artist
and
an
old
scholar
and
philosopher
whom
she
had
known
abroad
and
loved
and
honoured
and
there
was
thomasine
a
little
worn
and
faded
but
with
happiness
stealing
over
her
and
mary
magazine
busy
with
the
cakes
and
ale
there
have
been
a
better
housewarming
thomasine
thomasine
began
to
bloom
afresh
factory
and
department
store
and
business
school
and
office
lay
behind
her
each
a
stage
upon
a
somewhat
dull
and
dusty
and
road
of
life
business
school
and
office
training
for
mind
and
fingers
alike
a
resulting
place
with
a
firm
all
that
was
hagar
helping
a
matter
of
the
last
six
or
seven
years
and
now
hagar
had
come
back
and
had
made
thomasine
an
offer
and
thomasine
closed
with
it
very
simply
and
gladly
she
had
from
the
beginning
worked
hard
and
as
best
she
could
and
had
given
good
value
for
her
pay
and
now
she
was
going
still
to
do
all
that
but
to
do
it
with
a
singing
heart
and
her
hunger
for
beauty
and
fitness
fed
the
colour
came
back
into
her
cheeks
she
began
to
take
on
a
beauty
she
brought
seriously
into
conversation
one
day
the
fact
that
she
had
always
been
good
at
finding
clovers
jim
and
marietta
were
doing
fairly
still
over
in
new
jersey
fairly
meant
a
poor
house
which
marietta
did
her
best
to
keep
clean
and
two
of
the
children
working
and
the
city
for
summer
and
winter
and
jim
pay
envelope
neither
larger
nor
heavier
but
the
cost
of
living
both
but
jim
had
his
job
and
marietta
was
not
so
ailing
as
she
used
to
be
and
the
two
children
brought
in
a
little
and
thomasine
helped
each
month
so
they
might
be
said
to
be
doing
much
better
than
many
others
there
was
even
talk
of
being
able
one
day
to
get
the
whole
family
being
fond
of
music
one
of
the
cheaper
phonographs
hagar
and
thomasine
worked
through
the
mornings
hagar
thinking
remembering
creating
thomasine
taking
from
her
the
labour
of
record
caring
also
for
her
letters
and
the
keeping
of
accounts
and
all
small
recurring
business
and
thomasine
loved
to
do
any
shopping
that
arose
to
be
done
which
was
well
for
hagar
hated
shopping
and
loved
to
keep
the
apartment
just
so
the
two
lived
in
quiet
harmonious
intercourse
together
in
working
hours
but
when
working
hours
were
over
each
going
freely
her
individual
way
thomasine
too
had
friends
she
wrote
to
jim
and
marietta
and
to
maggie
at
home
taking
care
of
the
mother
with
the
spine
that
she
had
been
so
happy
since
they
used
to
go
to
grandmother
at
gilead
balm
rose
darragh
rose
darragh
had
not
been
at
hagar
housewarming
she
was
speaking
that
night
in
newark
but
some
days
afterwards
she
came
came
late
one
afternoon
with
the
statement
that
she
had
the
evening
free
she
and
thomasine
and
hagar
dined
in
the
caf√©
together
but
thomasine
hurried
through
her
dinner
for
she
was
going
to
the
theatre
with
a
with
whom
she
had
worked
for
two
years
downtown
and
who
was
such
a
nice
girl
and
with
the
stenographer
brother
who
looked
like
a
nice
brother
hagar
and
rose
darragh
left
at
the
table
sipped
their
coffee
a
quality
of
rose
darragh
came
out
she
observed
and
deduced
to
the
amusement
of
herself
and
of
others
with
the
swiftness
and
accuracy
of
dupin
or
of
sherlock
holmes
they
had
a
small
corner
table
commanding
the
long
bright
room
twenty
tables
she
said
men
and
women
and
a
fair
number
of
children
not
proportionately
so
large
a
number
as
once
there
would
have
been
and
that
is
well
the
bawlers
of
to
the
contrary
i
interested
in
the
women
just
now
man
had
the
centre
of
the
stage
for
so
long
and
of
course
we
know
that
this
is
the
century
of
the
child
see
and
canneries
but
woman
woman
just
coming
out
of
the
wings
there
rather
an
interesting
collection
here
do
you
know
any
of
them
i
have
spoken
casually
to
several
i
have
been
here
you
know
only
the
shortest
time
there
a
woman
over
there
who
has
a
wonderful
face
brooding
and
wise
a
teacher
is
she
i
should
say
she
was
not
married
yes
she
is
a
teacher
and
single
there
a
woman
who
is
a
nurse
yes
there
a
sick
child
in
that
family
but
she
is
not
in
uniform
i
know
her
all
the
same
she
a
good
nurse
there
are
those
who
are
and
those
who
are
but
she
got
strength
and
poise
and
knows
what
she
is
about
and
is
those
two
women
over
there
yes
what
do
you
make
of
them
there
such
a
glitter
of
diamonds
you
ca
see
the
women
poor
things
to
be
beings
of
a
single
element
to
live
in
a
world
of
pure
carbon
to
be
the
hardest
thing
there
is
and
yet
be
so
brittle
too
the
woman
next
them
is
good
ordinary
nothing
remarkable
and
yet
pleasant
enough
the
worst
that
can
be
said
of
her
is
that
she
discriminate
if
the
broth
lacks
salt
she
never
knows
it
and
the
two
over
there
with
the
stout
man
rose
darragh
gazed
a
moment
with
eyes
slightly
narrowed
oh
those
she
said
those
are
our
adapted
women
perilously
near
adapted
at
any
rate
that
a
sucking
wife
and
daughter
take
your
premise
that
in
the
divine
order
of
things
the
male
opens
the
folds
of
his
being
surrounds
encloses
and
and
for
your
female
in
season
and
out
of
season
when
there
is
need
and
when
there
is
certainly
none
and
your
further
premise
that
the
female
is
willing
and
ruthlessly
logical
and
behold
the
supremely
natural
conclusion
daughters
of
the
horse
leech
and
perfectly
respectable
members
of
society
as
constituted
faugh
with
their
mouths
glued
to
that
fat
man
pocket
he
looks
haggard
and
at
the
moment
he
probably
grinding
the
faces
of
no
end
of
men
and
women
not
because
he
got
a
bad
heart
and
really
wants
to
but
because
he
got
to
for
those
two
perfectly
strong
and
healthy
persons
in
jewelry
and
orchids
he
cowed
by
tradition
into
accepting
the
monstrous
position
and
weak
enough
to
let
them
define
what
is
he
got
to
keep
filling
and
filling
the
pocket
because
they
suck
so
fast
do
you
think
they
can
change
they
can
be
forced
to
change
they
do
want
to
change
any
more
than
the
copepod
wants
to
change
and
logically
while
he
persists
in
his
present
attitude
the
man
ca
ask
them
to
change
he
ca
keep
his
cake
and
eat
it
too
she
drank
her
coffee
that
very
stout
gentleman
who
is
being
driven
to
bankruptcy
or
to
ways
that
are
queer
is
just
the
kind
to
strike
the
table
with
his
fist
and
violently
to
assure
you
that
god
meant
woman
lovely
woman
to
be
dependent
upon
man
and
that
it
is
with
deep
regret
that
he
sees
woman
crowding
into
industry
and
beating
at
the
doors
of
the
professions
woman
wife
and
mother
god
bless
her
do
you
notice
how
they
always
put
wife
first
if
the
association
opposed
to
the
extension
of
the
franchise
to
women
asked
him
for
a
contribution
they
probably
get
it
how
numerous
do
you
think
are
those
women
the
copepods
numerous
enough
pity
is
but
not
so
numerous
as
given
the
system
you
might
fairly
expect
numerous
positively
but
not
relatively
and
a
lot
of
them
have
simply
succumbed
to
environmental
pressure
given
a
generation
or
two
of
rational
training
and
a
nobler
ideal
of
what
befits
a
human
being
and
the
copepod
will
yet
succour
herself
denny
and
i
see
more
of
the
other
kind
the
drudges
outnumber
the
copepods
and
neither
need
be
there
a
girl
over
there
i
like
the
one
with
the
braided
hair
many
of
the
young
girls
of
are
rather
wonderful
it
going
to
be
interesting
to
see
what
they
do
when
they
older
and
what
their
daughters
will
do
got
a
fine
head
mathematics
i
should
think
they
went
down
together
in
the
large
and
comfortable
half
study
half
with
the
shaded
lights
with
the
sound
of
the
city
without
the
windows
with
the
books
and
pictures
they
walked
a
little
to
and
fro
together
and
at
last
paused
before
a
window
and
looked
forth
the
firmament
studded
with
lights
above
and
the
city
studded
with
lights
below
there
a
noble
word
called
work
said
rose
darragh
and
we
have
degraded
it
into
toil
on
the
one
hand
and
it
has
a
strong
enemy
called
false
ideals
on
the
other
what
i
ask
of
life
is
that
i
may
be
one
of
the
helpers
to
save
work
from
toil
and
false
ideals
they
watched
the
lights
in
silence
then
turned
back
to
the
soft
glowing
room
when
each
had
taken
a
deep
chair
on
either
side
of
the
great
library
table
they
still
kept
silent
rose
darragh
sat
erect
lithe
strong
embrowned
a
wine
red
in
her
cheeks
as
in
the
picture
that
hagar
remembered
her
strong
throat
rose
clear
from
a
blouse
of
the
simplest
make
only
a
soft
dark
silk
instead
of
wool
in
honour
of
the
evening
her
skirt
was
of
dark
cheviot
she
wore
no
stays
it
was
evident
and
needed
none
her
hair
of
a
warm
chestnut
wavy
and
bright
was
cut
to
about
the
length
worn
by
byron
and
keats
and
shelley
to
a
marked
extent
she
was
there
was
felt
a
powerful
nature
rich
and
indomitable
presently
she
spoke
denny
will
be
home
next
week
do
you
want
me
to
take
you
one
day
to
see
the
shrine
where
he
keeps
his
idol
and
watch
him
providing
acceptable
sacrifice
it
rich
the
editorial
room
of
yes
i
should
like
it
very
much
then
we
go
down
some
morning
soon
there
a
place
near
the
temple
where
they
give
you
a
decent
omelette
and
cheese
we
all
three
go
there
for
luncheon
denny
fine
i
very
sure
of
that
yes
warp
and
woof
he
sincere
and
that
what
i
worship
sincerity
and
he
able
he
strikes
more
narrowly
than
i
do
but
he
strikes
deep
we
lived
and
worked
together
now
eight
years
seen
hard
times
together
we
nearly
starved
together
we
made
a
name
and
come
out
together
and
bigger
than
our
own
fates
we
seen
our
cause
bludgeoned
and
seen
it
lift
its
bleeding
head
we
known
together
impersonal
sorrow
and
joy
humbling
and
pride
fear
and
faith
despair
and
hope
denny
and
i
are
the
best
friends
we
been
lovers
in
the
flesh
but
there
something
better
than
that
between
us
she
turned
square
to
the
light
and
hagar
that
the
truest
truth
and
yet
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
think
you
always
been
to
him
a
kind
of
unearthly
and
spiritual
romance
he
kept
you
lifted
moving
above
him
in
the
clouds
beckoning
with
a
light
about
you
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
have
not
grudged
that
i
spoke
to
you
as
i
did
the
other
day
said
hagar
because
somehow
i
had
that
impulse
it
was
not
necessary
that
i
should
do
so
that
of
which
i
spoke
had
long
passed
she
rose
and
walked
slowly
back
and
forth
in
the
room
when
i
bethought
myself
that
month
in
nassau
of
where
i
not
he
was
drifting
i
was
able
then
to
leave
that
current
and
leave
it
not
to
re√´nter
that
was
three
years
ago
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
that
temptation
if
it
was
a
temptation
is
far
behind
me
my
soul
will
not
return
that
way
can
not
return
that
way
and
now
i
simply
want
to
be
friends
i
meet
you
there
i
like
you
too
much
not
to
want
to
you
seem
to
me
one
of
those
rare
ones
who
find
their
lamp
and
refuge
in
themselves
and
i
like
you
extraordinarily
i
should
like
to
work
with
you
there
is
nothing
said
rose
darragh
any
easier
to
arrange
than
that
chapter
xxx
an
old
acquaintance
in
the
year
a
certain
large
gathering
of
suffragists
occurring
in
new
york
permission
was
sought
and
obtained
for
speaking
in
union
square
here
and
there
beneath
the
trees
sprang
temporary
tribunes
sheathed
with
bunting
the
colour
of
gold
above
them
banners
and
banneroles
of
the
same
hue
votes
for
women
from
each
tribune
now
a
woman
was
speaking
now
a
man
about
speakers
and
tribunes
pressed
the
crowd
commenting
earnest
in
places
each
speaker
had
about
ten
minutes
time
up
he
or
she
stepped
down
another
took
position
sometimes
the
crowd
laughed
at
a
good
story
or
at
a
barbed
shaft
skilfully
shot
sometimes
it
applauded
sometimes
it
indulged
in
questions
its
units
continually
shifted
one
or
more
speakers
at
this
stand
listened
to
it
went
roaming
for
pastures
new
and
brought
up
before
the
next
tribune
whose
crowd
roaming
in
its
turn
filled
the
just
vacated
spaces
it
was
a
still
the
leaves
falling
from
the
trees
the
roar
of
the
city
softened
the
square
frontier
lines
of
tall
buildings
withdrawn
a
little
blurred
made
looming
and
poetic
all
was
a
picture
lightly
shifting
with
gleams
of
gold
and
a
woman
voice
earnest
lilting
the
crowd
increased
until
there
was
a
great
crowd
votes
for
women
votes
for
women
said
the
banners
and
the
banneroles
a
man
and
a
woman
leaving
a
taxicab
on
the
broadway
facet
of
the
square
stood
a
moment
upon
the
pavement
what
a
crowd
said
the
man
there
is
speaking
of
some
kind
he
stopped
a
boy
what
is
going
on
suffragettes
women
speaking
want
ter
vote
ai
got
no
would
let
say
ai
they
gettin
too
big
for
their
places
the
boy
stuck
out
his
tongue
and
went
away
young
hoodlum
exclaimed
the
man
with
disgust
let
us
stay
and
hear
them
for
a
while
i
never
have
all
right
i
pay
the
cab
he
came
back
to
her
and
they
moved
across
and
under
the
trees
are
you
interested
i
think
i
am
i
have
made
up
my
mind
we
so
far
south
that
as
a
movement
it
all
as
yet
only
a
rather
distant
sound
how
do
you
feel
about
it
why
i
think
it
an
honest
proposition
i
never
seen
why
not
we
all
human
together
are
we
but
building
bridges
for
south
american
governments
has
kept
me
too
a
little
out
of
earshot
i
see
what
the
papers
say
and
they
saying
a
good
deal
ours
chiefly
confine
themselves
to
being
scandalized
by
the
english
militants
then
your
papers
are
very
foolish
who
ever
supposed
there
jacobins
in
every
historic
struggle
for
liberty
sometimes
they
help
and
sometimes
they
hinder
and
sometimes
they
do
both
at
once
rather
superficial
to
see
only
the
and
not
the
movement
of
which
it
is
the
they
came
beneath
the
trees
upon
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
about
one
of
the
stands
this
was
an
attentive
crowd
not
restless
but
listening
slanted
forward
the
man
from
the
taxicab
touched
a
young
workman
upon
the
arm
who
is
it
speaking
the
other
turned
a
pale
tense
face
it
one
that
can
hold
them
it
rose
darragh
speaking
for
the
the
two
made
their
way
to
where
they
could
see
and
hear
rose
darragh
speaking
with
a
lifted
irony
and
passion
sent
her
last
parthian
arrow
paused
a
moment
then
cried
with
a
vibrant
voice
give
the
a
vote
and
stepped
back
and
down
from
the
stand
by
george
breathed
the
man
from
the
cab
the
crowd
applauded
for
such
a
meeting
applauded
loudly
the
young
man
to
whom
the
two
had
appealed
cried
out
also
give
the
a
vote
she
working
dumb
and
driven
under
your
factory
laws
give
her
the
vote
a
large
man
who
had
been
making
remarks
turned
with
anger
and
have
them
striking
at
the
polls
as
well
as
striking
in
the
shop
doubling
the
ignorant
vote
and
getting
into
the
way
of
business
you
better
listen
to
what
i
tell
you

from
the
cab
john

by
name
with
his
lily
fay
who
had
been
lily
goldwell
moved
still
nearer
the
front
they
could
see
rose
darragh
pausing
for
a
moment
beside
the
stand
before
she
went
away
to
another
tribune
a
woman
dressed
in
spoke
to
her
laughing
then
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
mounted
to
the
platform
two
women
behind
lily

whispered
together

woman
like

herself
under
a
mental
and
moral
compulsion
consciously
to
further
what
is
called
the
woman
movement
she
spoke
for
ten
minutes
when
she
ended
and
stepped
from
the
platform
there
followed
a
moment
of
silence
then
applause
broke
forth
a
breathless
girl
a
lettered

across

men

but
a
good
proportion
of
the
crowd

lily
fay
among
them
followed
the
skirt
they
followed
from
stand
to
stand
during
the
next
hour
at
the
end
of
which
time
speaking
was
over
for
that
day
the
crowd
broke
up
the
speakers
after
some
cheerful
talk
among
themselves
gathered
together
their
banners
and
pennants
and
went
their
several
ways
committees

after
the
of
the
stands

from

hotel
through
a
twilight
tinted
like
a
shell
when
they
came
to
the
apartment
house
and
were
carried
up
up
and
left
the
elevator
and
rang
at
the
door
before
them
and
it
opened
and
they
were
admitted
by
a
tidy
coloured
maid
it
was
to
find
themselves
a
little
in
advance
of
their
hostess
mary
magazine
explained
with
slow
soft

and
mary
magazine
smiled
slowly
and
disappeared
the
large
room
had
not
greatly
altered
in
appearance
since
rachel
and
hagar
first
arranged
it
three
years
ago
there
were
more
books
a
few
more
prints
more
signed
photographs
a
somewhat
richer
tone
of
time
it
was
a
good
room
quiet
and
fine
not
lacking
an
air
of
nobility
a
great
bough
of
red
autumn
leaves
flamed
at
one
end
like
a
window
a
door
opening
into
a
small
room
showed
a
typewriter
and
a
desk
piled
with
work
the
two
visitors
with
fifteen
minutes
of
sole
possession
before
them
strolled
to
the
windows
and
admired
the
grandiose
view
twilight
beginning
to
be
starred
with
the
city
lights
then
turned
back
to
the
room
and
its
strong
charm
we
lived
through
the
revolution
i
think
said
john
fay
the
senses
move
more
slowly
than
the
event
we
just
taking
it
in
and
we
call
it
all
to
make
but
it
really
made
i
see
what
you
mean
but
they
but
we
have
all
this
monstrous
amount
of
hard
work
yet
yes
introducing
the
revolution
to
the
but
i
gather
being
done
he
moved
about
the
room
looking
at
the
photographs
artists
and
thinkers
and
men
and
women
those
years
down
there
around
the
equator
i
could
at
least
take
the
magazines
and
i
got
each
twelvemonth
a
box
of
books
i
know
all
these
people
i
used
to
feel
quite
intimate
with
them
down
there
building
bridges
building
bridges
is
great
work
i
believe
in
it
thoroughly
and
quite
enjoy
doing
it
and
these
are
too
and
i
had
a
fraternal
feeling
i
cut
their
pictures
men
and
women
from
the
magazines
and
stuck
them
up
in
my
hut
and
said
and
to
them
he
had
the
pleasantest
humorous
eyes
and
now
they
twinkled
sometimes
i
like
them
so
well
that
i
really
to
them
and
i
laid
a
platonic
sprig
of
flowers
before
more
than
one
of
these
women
pictures
perhaps
i
better
not
tell
her
so
but
there
was
a
picture
of
hagar
ashendyne
the
door
opened
and
hagar
entered
she
wore
the
dress
of
yesterday
she
was
somewhat
pale
with
circles
under
her
eyes
ah
i
am
sorry
she
said
but
i
could
not
help
it
the
strike
and
they
send
the
girls
to
the
island
two
or
three
of
us
went
to
the
court
oh
the
snaky
blind
thing
we
call
justice
her
eyes
filled
pardon
but
if
you
had
been
there
she
caught
herself
up
dashed
the
moisture
from
her
eyes
and
said
and
looked
that
she
was
glad
to
see
them
we
put
the
things
away
that
make
your
heart
ache
i
go
and
change
and
we
eat
our
dinner
and
have
a
pleasant
pleasant
time
in
a
very
little
while
she
was
back
dressed
in
white
amethysts
in
an
old
and
curious
setting
about
her
throat
they
had
been
maria
and
she
looked
like
maria
lines
of
the
haunted
mind
about
her
mouth
and
between
her
eyes
only
it
was
not
her
personal
fate
that
troubled
her
but
a
wider
haunting
at
dinner
in
the
caf√©
at
the
corner
table
she
told
them
when
they
asked
her
a
little
of
where
she
had
been
and
what
she
had
done
during
the
day
told
them
of
this
pitiful
case
and
of
that
then
after
a
moment
silence
she
said
resolutely
do
let
us
talk
about
these
things
any
more
let
us
talk
about
happy
things
talk
to
me
about
yourself
lily

down
to
the
grave
and
fair
room
with
the
scarlet
autumn
leaves
and
the
books
and
here
mary
magazine
gave
them
coffee
they
sat
in
their
deep
chairs
and
drank
it
slowly
the
talk
dropped
they
sat
in
a
thoughtful
mood
john
fay
had
a
long
and
easy
figure
a
bronzed
humorous
face
and
eyes
lily
was
slender
as
a
willow
wand
with
colourless
strong
features
her
eyes
were
dreamy
hagar
remembered
how
she
sat
and
looked
into
the
fire
when
they
read
poetry
like
the
faintest
faraway
strain
of
a
music
not
altogether
welcome
a
line
went
through
her
mind
where
the
end
of
evening
smiles
miles
and
miles
hagar
with
her
odd
pensive
enigmatical
face
drove
the
strain
back
to
the
limbo
whence
it
came
she
and
lily
talked
of
the
girls
so
long
ago
at
eglantine
of
sylvie
and
francie
and
all
the
rest
the
living
and
the
dead
and
the
scattered
fates
neither
had
ever
been
back
to
the
school
but
she
could
tell
lily
of
legrand
health
and
prosperity
you
do
like
her
said
lily
i
was
so
ill
and
homesick
i
did
have
energy
one
way
or
the
other
but
she
was
very
smooth
i
remember
that
and
we
were
all
to
marry
and
only
to
marry
marry
money
and
social
position
especially
social
position
they
talked
of
the
teachers
i
liked
miss
gage
said
hagar
and
lane
was
a
gentle
sweet
woman
do
you
remember
m
morel
yes
and
mr
laydon
lily
started
oh
hagar
i
had
forgotten
that
but
perhaps
there
was
nothing
in
it
hagar
laughed
if
you
meant
that
at
eighteen
i
sincerely
thought
i
loved
laydon
and
that
he
as
sincerely
i
do
believe
thought
that
he
loved
me
yes
there
was
that
in
it
but
we
found
out
with
fair
promptness
that
it
was
false
i
have
not
seen
nor
heard
of
him
for
many
years
he
taught
at
eglantine
for
a
while
and
then
he
went
i
believe
to
some
western
school
lily
lily
i
have
had
a
long
life
i
have
had
as
long
a
one
in
years
said
lily
but
yours
has
been
the
fuller
you
have
a
wonderful
life
we
all
have
wonderful
lives
answered
hagar
one
is
rich
after
this
fashion
one
after
that
the
bell
rang
in
another
moment
denny
gayde
came
into
the
big
room
the
six
years
since
the
nassau
month
had
wrought
little
outer
change
he
was
still
somewhat
thin
and
worn
with
a
face
at
once
keen
and
quiet
a
little
stern
with
eyes
that
saw
away
away
he
was
more
light
than
heat
but
there
was
warmth
too
and
it
glowed
and
deepened
all
around
onward
when
he
said
the
name
of
his
paper
it
was
as
though
he
caressed
it
he
was
like
a
whose
whole
being
had
become
bent
on
a
shore
to
tending
and
heightening
the
light
to
sending
the
rays
streaming
across
the
reefs
chapter
xxxi
john
fay
denny
said
hagar
ask
mary
magazine
to
give
you
a
denny
came
back
with
it
and
she
filled
it
from
the
silver
urn
rose
went
to
brooklyn
i
was
to
have
spoken
down
on
omega
street
but
at
the
last
moment
harding
came
in
and
i
sent
him
instead
got
the
strongest
kind
of
stuff
this
week
and
there
are
some
finishing
touches
i
going
back
to
the
office
in
an
hour
or
two
rose
said
that
she
asked
you
for
that
poem
and
that
you
said
you
would
give
it
and
she
thought
you
might
have
it
ready
i
got
a
telling
place
for
it
drink
your
coffee
and
talk
to
the
others
while
i
copy
it
out
said
hagar
she
rose
and
went
to
the
desk
in
the
smaller
room
when
she
came
back
lily
was
dreaming
with
her
eyes
upon
the
forest
bough
and
the
two
men
sat
discussing
syndicalism
she
laid
a
folded
piece
of
paper
upon
the
table
beside
denny
hand
there
are
only
three
verses
he
opened
the
paper
and
read
them
thank
you
hagar
you
struck
it
home
he
refolded
the
paper
and
was
about
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
when
john
fay
held
out
his
hand
may
i
see
it
too
he
looked
at
hagar
yes
of
course
if
you
wish
fay
read
it
held
the
paper
in
his
hand
for
a
moment
then
gave
it
back
to
denny
i
wish
i
could
write
like
that
he
said
his
tone
was
so
oddly
humble
that
hagar
laughed
i
wish
that
i
could
build
great
bridges
across
deep
rivers
she
said
they
sat
and
talked
and
the
poem
gave
leadings
to
their
talk
though
they
did
not
speak
of
the
poem
at
first
it
was
fay
answering
questions
telling
of
the
struggle
of
muscle
and
brain
with
the
physical
earth
of
he
was
he
had
been
engineering
building
in
strange
and
desert
places
since
he
was
a
boy
he
had
a
host
of
memories
of
struggles
now
desperate
and
picturesque
now
patient
and
drudging
grapples
of
mind
with
matter
encounters
with
solids
and
liquids
and
gases
he
had
had
to
manage
men
in
order
to
manage
these
he
had
had
to
know
how
to
manage
men
born
with
an
enquiring
mind
he
learned
as
he
went
along
his
governments
and
peoples
their
customs
institutions
strengths
and
weaknesses
also
he
knew
the
natural
history
of
places
and
loved
mother
earth
and
a
good
part
of
her
progeny
he
had
also
a
defined
quizzical
humour
which
saved
the
day
for
him
when
it
grew
too
strenuous
he
talked
well
with
a
certain
drawling
fitness
of
phrase
which
brought
medway
into
hagar
mind
but
not
unpleasantly
there
had
been
much
in
medway
which
she
had
liked
fay
was
no
monopolist
the
talk
went
from
one
to
another
and
denny
drew
more
into
it
he
had
been
listening
attentively
to
fay
it
your
work
he
said
and
it
tremendous
and
basic
work
you
been
doing
it
through
the
ages
ever
since
it
first
occurred
to
us
that
we
could
lengthen
an
arm
with
a
stick
and
crack
a
nut
or
an
enemy
head
with
a
stone
it
tremendous
and
basic
still
and
the
people
who
work
under
your
direction
and
atom
by
atom
give
you
power
why
one
day
said
fay
they
work
as
artists
a
far
day
doubtless
and
there
are
degrees
in
artists
but
i
see
no
other
conclusion
and
to
give
the
artist
component
in
the
mass
of
humanity
a
chance
to
strengthen
and
come
out
is
i
take
it
the
tremendous
and
basic
work
to
which
we
all
got
to
devote
the
next
century
or
two
oh
you
all
right
said
denny
hagar
smiled
my
old
from
nowhere
but
with
a
difference
said
denny
morris
was
an
dream
yes
we
are
more
complex
and
flowing
than
that
but
it
was
lovely
do
you
remember
the
harvest
home
and
the
masons
so
absorbed
and
happy
in
their
building
like
children
and
yet
conscious
artists
buoyant
free
fay
looked
at
her
what
he
said
is
vision
of
the
country
that
is
coming
her
candid
eyes
met
his
i
have
no
clear
vision
she
said
visions
too
are
flowing
the
vision
of
is
not
that
of
yesterday
and
may
be
different
yet
moreover
i
do
want
to
fix
a
vision
to
mount
it
like
a
butterfly
and
keep
it
with
the
life
gone
out
we
done
too
much
of
that
all
along
the
way
behind
us
vision
grows
and
who
wishes
to
say
the
beautiful
end
there
is
no
end
i
do
not
wish
a
rigid
mind
posturing
before
one
pictures
dissolve
and
altars
are
portable
yes
said
denny
but
lily
says
she
reads
vedanta
well
it
is
the
yogi
neti
almost
your
only
possible
definition
as
yet
is
this
not
this
the
country
that
is
coming
it
is
not
capitalism
though
capitalism
is
among
its
ancestors
it
is
not
war
though
in
the
past
it
warred
it
is
not
ecclesiasticism
though
ecclesiasticism
too
was
an
inn
on
its
road
it
is
not
though
that
too
is
behind
it
it
is
not
preoccupation
with
sex
at
all
it
is
not
sectionalism
nor
nationalism
nor
imperialism
it
is
not
racial
arrogance
it
is
not
arrogance
at
all
it
is
not
exploitation
it
is
not
hatred
it
is
not
selfishness
it
is
not
lust
it
is
not
bigotry
it
is
not
ignorance
or
pride
in
neti
it
is
beauty
and
truth
and
always
greater
and
it
comes
by
knowledge
out
of
which
grows
understanding
and
by
courage
out
of
which
come
great
actions
she
ceased
to
speak
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
her
hand
at
the
amethysts
about
her
throat
fay
kept
his
eyes
upon
her
he
was
conscious
of
a
resurgence
of
a
morning
of
a
couple
of
years
before
when
he
had
cut
from
a
magazine
a
page
bearing
a
portrait
and
had
pinned
it
above
his
hagar
ashendyne
had
said
the
legend
below
the
rustle
of
the
palms
outside
his
hut
came
to
him
and
the
mist
of
early
morning
above
the
waters
the
clock
on
hagar
struck
ten
with
a
silvery
stroke
denny
started
i
got
to
go
work
calling
i
had
rather
hear
you
say
at
ten
that
sleep
was
calling
said
hagar
you
working
too
hard
rose
says
so
and
i
say
so
she
looked
at
him
with
friendliness
deep
and
tender
soft
and
bright
almost
denny
only
fault
is
that
he
makes
his
work
his
god
rather
than
his
servant
at
times
he
perilously
near
offering
it
a
human
sacrifice
why
will
you
denny
there
so
much
to
do
and
so
few
are
doing
it
said
denny
his
eyes
were
upon
the
great
forest
bough
but
he
seemed
to
be
looking
beyond
it
down
long
long
vistas
i
do
know
that
i
worship
work
but
i
want
every
prisoner
of
wrong
to
rebel
and
there
no
time
to
waste
when
you
have
to
pass
the
word
along
to
so
many
cells
sometimes
i
feel
too
like
sitting
down
and
playing
but
when
i
do
i
always
begin
after
a
little
to
hear
the
chains
he
laughed
and
i
like
you
and
rose
preaching
far
if
ever
there
were
two
who
had
the
power
of
work
all
the
same
said
hagar
go
to
bed
before
two
wo
you
he
shook
hands
around
and
was
gone
what
a
wonderful
face
said
lily
and
fay
nodded
a
kind
of
worn
warrior
angel
hagar
took
lily
hand
and
kissed
it
you
defined
denny
to
a
nicety
kind
of
worn
warrior
angel
i
like
that
no
do
go
it
is
late
we
stay
then
just
one
other
and
now
said
lily
tell
me
about
yourself
we
see
your
name
of
course
and
what
the
papers
think
you
are
doing
but
you
yourself
but
i
myself
said
hagar
ah
if
you
tell
me
i
tell
you
the
great
bough
of
red
leaves
against
the
wall
was
repeated
in
miniature
by
a
spray
upon
the
table
resting
in
a
piece
of
cloudy
venetian
glass
hagar
took
it
from
the
vase
and
sat
studying
it
colour
and
line
she
sat
at
ease
in
the
deep
chair
her
long
slender
limbs
composed
her
head
thrown
back
against
an
arm
bent
and
raised
the
spray
in
her
hand
what
she
said
does
a
man
or
woman
do
in
a
dusty
day
march
of
every
great
transit
about
that
is
what
i
and
many
others
have
been
doing
in
this
age
as
in
other
ages
millions
of
minds
to
reach
with
a
statement
that
for
reasons
of
weight
the
column
must
surmount
such
a
hill
and
again
such
a
hill
the
line
of
march
lying
truly
on
higher
levels
the
statement
did
not
originate
with
the
messengers
of
this
or
any
other
age
it
is
social
and
the
inner
urge
would
send
the
marchers
somehow
on
but
there
is
needed
interpreting
clarifying
articulation
hence
the
office
that
we
fill
though
we
fill
it
as
yet
i
know
weakly
enough
so
it
means
a
preoccupation
with
communication
ways
and
means
of
reaching
minds
and
that
lacking
a
developed
telepathy
means
the
spoken
and
the
written
word
and
that
means
seeing
we
have
such
great
numbers
to
reach
a
continuing
endeavour
to
reach
people
in
congregation
and
that
means
arrangement
going
from
place
to
place
much
time
that
you
sigh
for
consumed
some
weariness
a
great
number
of
petty
happenings
and
a
vast
insight
into
life
and
the
way
it
is
lived
and
the
beings
who
live
it
it
means
contacts
with
reality
and
a
feeding
the
springs
of
humour
and
an
acquaintance
with
the
truly
astonishing
forest
of
human
motives
and
there
is
organization
work
and
correspondence
and
much
of
what
might
be
called
drudgery
unless
you
can
put
the
glow
about
it
and
there
is
the
weaving
all
the
time
of
the
web
of
unity
the
human
family
and
the
before
love
and
understanding
of
invidious
distinctions
the
world
one
home
and
men
one
man
though
of
an
infinite
variety
and
women
one
woman
though
of
an
infinite
variety
and
children
one
child
and
the
open
road
before
the
three
and
back
of
the
three
oneness
the
great
pulse
out
the
many
in
the
one
so
i
with
others
speak
and
write
and
go
about
and
work
when
the
clock
struck
again
lily
and
john
fay
said
lily
was
to
come
once
more
before
her
boat
sailed
hagar
looked
at
fay
you
are
going
to
england
too
he
hesitated
i
said
so
he
just
built
a
great
bridge
said
lily
and
he
has
really
taken
a
holiday
for
years
robert
and
i
want
him
just
as
long
as
he
will
travel
with
us
when
they
were
gone
hagar
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
far
and
wide
upon
the
city
settling
to
its
rest
here
would
be
deep
repose
here
fevered
tossing
here
perhaps
no
sleep
at
all
there
would
be
death
chambers
and
birth
chambers
a
many
of
each
and
spiritual
death
chambers
and
spiritual
birth
chambers
and
the
trodden
middle
rooms
minds
that
cried
light
more
light
and
minds
that
said
we
see
as
it
is
and
over
all
the
suns
so
far
away
they
were
but
glittering
points
hagar
gaze
moved
across
the
heavens
from
host
to
host
ah
if
you
were
hieroglyphics
and
we
could
find
the
key
she
came
back
to
the
lamplit
table
thomasine
away
mary
magazine
asleep
the
place
was
alone
with
her
she
had
been
tired
but
she
did
not
feel
so
now
she
sat
down
put
her
arms
above
her
head
and
her
eyes
upon
the
forest
bough
and
began
to
think
she
thought
visually
with
colour
and
light
and
form
luminous
images
parting
the
mist
rising
in
the
great
interior
sphere
she
sat
there
till
the
clock
struck
twelve
then
she
rose
put
out
the
lights
opened
every
window
in
the
east
above
the
roofs
glittered
orion
with
aldebaran
red
and
mighty
and
the
glimmering
pleiades
hagar
stood
and
gazed
she
lifted
her
eyes
toward
the
zenith
capella
and
algol
and
the
street
whose
dust
is
stars
between
her
lips
moved
she
raised
her
hand
all
hail
she
said
then
turning
from
the
window
opened
the
door
that
led
into
her
bedroom
it
was
a
white
and
fair
and
simple
place
as
she
undressed
she
was
thinking
of
the
october
woods
at
gilead
balm
three
days
later
at
the
hotel
lily
and
john
fay
had
a
short
but
momentous
conversation
you
want
to
go
john
i
do
want
you
to
go
if
you
do
want
to
go

know
that

came
to

fay

of
you

i
do
want
to
disappoint

the
least
disappointment
but
i
do
know
that
she
ever
marry
said
lily
she
not
unless
she
finds
some
one
alike
to
strengthen
and
be
strengthened
by
a
lot
of
the
reasons
for
which
women
used
to
marry
are
out
of
court
with
her
even
what
we
call
love
she
wo
feel
it
now
for
anything
less
than
something
that
matches
her
fay
walked
across
the
floor
stood
at
the
window
a
moment
then
came
back
i
wo
fence
he
said
it
simple
truth
however
you
divined
it
and
i
going
to
stay
i
do
match
her
but
i
never
proposed
to
stop
growing
chapter

ralph
fay
stayed
lily
farewell
note
to
hagar
merely
said
that
after
all
he
was
not
sailing
with
her
and
that
she
hoped
hagar
would
let
him
be
among
her
friends
he
made
a
good
friend
fay
himself
wrote
to
her
stating
that
he
would
be
much
in
new
york
that
autumn
and
winter
and
asking
if
he
might
come
to
see
her
she
answered
yes
but
that
she
herself
was
often
away
he
would
have
to
take
the
chance
of
not
finding
her
he
came
and
she
was
away
came
again
and
she
was
away
then
she
wrote
and
asked
him
to
dine
with
her
on
such
an
evening
he
went
and
it
was
an
evening
to
mark
with
a
white
stone
to
keep
a
lamp
burning
before
in
the
mind
he
asked
how
he
could
find
out
where
she
would
be
since
it
was
evident
that
she
was
speaking
here
and
there
she
nodded
she
was
working
hard
that
autumn
oftenest
in
company
with
rose
darragh
but
often
too
with
elizabeth
eden
and
marie
caton
with
rachel
and
molly
josslyn
she
showed
him
a
list
of
meetings
he
thanked
her
and
copied
it
down
i
see
that
your
book
will
presently
be
out
yes
i
hope
that
you
will
like
it
i
think
that
i
shall
how
hard
you
work
not
harder
than
others
the
secret
is
to
learn
concentration
and
to
fill
all
the
interstices
with
the
balm
of
leisure
and
to
work
with
love
of
the
world
to
be
that
november
together
with
rose
darragh
and
denny
and
elizabeth
she
was
often
speaking
in
the
poor
and
crowded
sections
of
the
great
city
sometimes
they
talked
to
the
people
in
dim
small
halls
sometimes
in
larger
brighter
places
sometimes
there
were
street
meetings
she
grew
aware
that
often
fay
was
present
sometimes
when
the
meeting
was
over
he
joined
her
it
began
to
be
no
infrequent
thing
his
going
uptown
upon
the
car
with
her
she
began
to
wonder
once
in
a
street
meeting
she
saw
him
near
her
as
she
spoke
it
was
a
good
crowd
and
interested
as
she
brought
her
brief
straight
talk
to
a
conclusion
elizabeth
whispered
to
her
lucien
could
come
is
there
any
one
else
who
could
speak
hagar
eyes
met
john
fay
we
lack
a
speaker
she
said
could
you
wo
you
he
nodded
stepped
upon
the
box
and
made
a
good
speech
his
drawling
telling
periods
his
smiling
eyes
a
story
that
he
told
and
a
blow
or
two
out
from
the
shoulder
caught
the
fancy
and
then
the
of
the
crowd
an
old
woman
irish
wrinkled
her
hands
on
her
hips
called
out
to
him
be
yez
the
new
man
if
yez
are
i
loike
yez
foine
he
laughed
at
and
with
her
do
you
then
you
have
to
become
a
new
woman
to
match
me
the
november
dusk
was
closing
in
when
the
crowd
dispersed
elizabeth
with
the
other
woman
speaker
faced
toward
the
settlement
ca
you
come
with
me
hagar
no
not
there
are
letters
and
letters
fay
asked
if
he
might
go
uptown
with
her
she
nodded
yes
if
you
like
elizabeth
mary
ware
they
took
a
surface
car
she
sat
for
a
minute
with
her
eyes
shut
are
you
very
tired
she
smiled
no
i
am
not
tired
after
all
why
should
it
fatigue
more
than
standing
in
cathedrals
walking
through
art
galleries
but
i
was
thinking
of
something
let
us
sit
quietly
for
a
while
the
minutes
went
by
at
last
she
spoke
i
liked
what
you
said
and
the
way
you
said
it
thank
you
you
do
not
need
to
thank
me
had
i
been
less
convinced
i
might
have
spoken
because
you
asked
me
to
as
it
is
i
was
willing
to
serve
the
truth
ah
good
there
was
another
silence
then
she
began
to
speak
of
the
light
and
thunder
of
the
city
about
them
and
then
of
a
book
she
was
reading
when
they
left
the
car
it
was
dark
they
walked
westward
together
have
you
heard
from
lily
yes
she
and
robert
are
going
first
to
the
riviera
then
to
sicily
both
are
very
lovely
why
do
you
not
change
your
mind
and
go
i
like
it
better
here
the
evening
was
dark
clear
and
windy
with
the
stars
trooping
out
when
asked
hagar
are
you
going
to
build
another
bridge
he
pondered
it
i
been
building
for
a
long
time
and
i
going
to
build
for
another
long
time
do
you
grudge
me
this
in
between
i
do
not
i
was
only
wondering
she
broke
off
and
began
to
talk
about
the
josslyns
whom
it
had
turned
out
he
knew
and
liked
two
weeks
ago
she
had
dined
there
with
him
and
christopher
had
taken
occasion
to
tell
her
that
john
fay
was
about
the
rightest
all
right
he
knew
she
had
not
really
needed
the
telling
she
had
a
good
deal
of
insight
herself
they
came
to
the
great
arched
door
of
the
apartment
house
and
there
she
told
fay
when
he
was
gone
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
paved
lobby
with
its
palm
or
two
her
eyes
upon
the
clear
darkness
without
then
she
turned
to
the
elevator
upstairs
within
her
own
doors
thomasine
met
her
oh
hagar
it
ralph
ralph
ralph
had
been
abroad
and
she
had
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
yes
said
thomasine
his
boat
came
in
yesterday
evening
and
awhile
ago
he
telephoned
to
ask
you
if
he
might
come
to
dinner
with
you
and
i
did
know
what
to
say
and
i
told
him
you
would
be
in
till
late
and
he
said
did
i
think
you
mind
his
coming
and
i
did
know
what
to
say
so
i
said
i
could
think
so
and
he
asked
what
time
you
dined
and
it
nearly
seven
now
well
you
could
say
anything
else
said
hagar
only
i
devoutly
hope
she
moved
toward
her
own
room
i
dress
quickly
and
do
you
think
said
thomasine
that
i
better
not
dine
with
you
i
think
just
the
contrary
answered
hagar
and
vanished
ralph
came
he
was
the
ralph
of
three
years
ago
of
that
last
autumn
week
at
gilead
balm
only
with
certain
things
accentuated
he
was
richer
he
had
more
and
more
a
name
in
finance
his
state
was
now
loudly
and
perpetually
proud
of
him
there
was
an
indefinable
hardening
he
was
very
handsome
thomasine
thought
he
looked
tremendously
somebody
he
had
been
around
the
world
his
physician
had
sent
him
off
because
of
a
threatened
apparently
that
had
been
staved
off
pushed
at
least
into
a
closet
to
stay
there
a
few
years
he
talked
well
with
vigorous
clipped
sentences
of
australia
and
china
and
india
hagar
sitting
opposite
him
in
a
filmy
black
gown
kept
the
talk
upon
travel
she
had
not
seen
him
for
eighteen
months
and
before
then
for
a
long
while
their
meetings
had
been
casual
cold
and
stiff
enough
with
upon
his
side
an
absurd
hauteur
the
eighteen
months
had
at
least
dissipated
that
dinner
over
they
went
for
coffee
back
to
the
apartment
and
thomasine
determinedly
disappeared
old
gilead
balm
talk
was
in
thomasine
mind
ralph
coltsworth
and
hagar
ashendyne
were
to
mate
old
miss
had
somehow
kept
that
in
the
air
even
so
long
long
ago
in
the
grave
and
restful
room
with
its
shaded
lights
hagar
poured
a
cup
of
coffee
for
her
cousin
and
gave
it
to
him
taking
it
he
took
for
a
moment
also
her
two
hands
long
slender
and
very
finely
made
ringless
he
said
hagar
withdrawing
them
poured
her
own
coffee
i
have
never
cared
to
wear
jewels
a
necklace
and
an
old
brooch
or
two
of
my
mother
are
almost
the
only
things
i
have
ralph
looked
about
the
room
the
bough
of
flaming
maple
was
gone
and
in
its
place
rested
a
great
branch
of
white
pine
her
eyes
followed
his
i
can
see
the
forest
through
it
do
you
remember
the
great
pine
above
the
spring
his
gaze
still
roamed
and
you
call
this
home
yes
it
is
home
without
a
man
she
smiled
do
you
think
there
can
be
no
home
without
a
man
he
drank
his
coffee
then
putting
down
the
cup
rose
and
moved
about
the
deep
and
wide
place
she
watched
him
from
her
armchair
long
and
slim
as
diana
in
her
black
robe
he
looked
at
the
walls
with
their
rows
of
cabined
thought
and
the
pictures
above
at
the
great
library
table
with
its
tokens
of
work
and
then
standing
before
the
wide
clear
windows
at
the
multitudinous
lights
of
the
world
without
a
sound
as
of
a
distant
sea
came
through
the
glass
and
without
a
child
her
clear
voice
sounded
behind
him
you
are
mistaken
she
said
my
work
is
my
child
one
human
being
serves
and
expresses
in
one
way
and
one
in
another
and
i
think
it
is
not
the
office
which
is
higher
or
lower
but
only
the
mind
with
which
the
office
is
performed
did
i
ever
meet
a
man
whom
i
loved
and
who
was
my
comrade
and
who
loved
me
and
saw
in
me
his
comrade
my
home
would
probably
open
to
that
man
and
we
two
might
say
in
cleanliness
and
joy
and
awe
will
we
bring
a
child
into
our
home
i
think
that
would
be
a
happy
thing
to
happen
but
if
it
does
not
happen
none
the
less
will
i
have
my
earthly
home
as
i
have
my
unearthly
and
be
happy
in
it
and
none
the
less
will
i
do
and
rejoice
in
the
doing
and
if
it
happened
it
would
be
but
added
bliss
it
would
be
by
no
means
all
the
bliss
or
all
the
world
nor
should
it
be
we
grow
larger
than
that
and
now
having
answered
your
question
come
let
us
sit
down
and
talk
about
what
you
are
doing
and
when
you
are
going
down
to
hawk
nest
i
had
a
letter
from
gilead
balm
last
week
from
aunt
serena
he
came
and
sat
down
the
last
time
i
was
at
gilead
balm
two
years
and
a
half
ago
they
said
they
had
ceased
to
write
to
you
they
have
begun
again
said
hagar
calmly
dear
ralph
we
live
in
the
twentieth
century
you
yourself
are
here
eating
my
bread
and
salt
have
you
been
to
gilead
balm
yes
i
went
last
summer
and
again
the
summer
before
not
for
long
for
a
little
while
grandfather
and
grandmother
and
aunt
serena
said
some
hard
things
but
i
think
they
enjoyed
saying
them
and
i
could
ramble
over
the
old
place
and
indeed
i
think
though
they
would
never
have
said
so
that
they
were
glad
to
have
me
there
i
will
not
quarrel
they
are
so
feeble
the
colonel
and
old
miss
i
do
not
think
they
can
live
many
years
longer
are
you
going
again
this
summer
yes
they
talked
again
of
his
journey
and
recovered
health
of
new
york
of
the
political
and
financial
condition
of
the
country
or
rather
he
gave
his
view
upon
this
and
she
sat
studying
him
her
fine
long
hands
folded
in
her
lap
what
with
question
and
remark
she
kept
him
for
a
long
time
upon
general
topics
or
upon
his
increasing
part
in
the
subtle
machinery
behind
so
much
that
made
general
talk
but
at
last
skilfully
as
she
fenced
he
came
back
to
personal
life
and
to
his
resentment
of
all
her
attitude
he
had
thought
that
time
and
absence
had
cured
his
passion
for
her
even
a
month
ago
he
had
told
himself
that
there
was
left
only
family
interest
old
boyish
memories
he
disapproved
intensely
of
the
way
she
thought
of
things
she
was
not
at
all
the
wife
for
him
sylvie
carter
was
he
would
go
to
see
sylvie
just
as
soon
as
he
reached
new
york
and
then
upon
the
boat
coming
over
it
was
of
hagar
that
he
dreamed
all
the
time
like
a
gathering
thunderstorm
it
was
all
coming
back
landing
in
new
york
he
had
only
thought
of
her
all
last
night
and
it
was
an
obsession
he
told
himself
that
he
could
see
that
once
he
had
her
possessed
her
owned
her
he
would
fight
her
through
life
or
she
would
fight
him
and
all
the
same
the
obsession
had
him
whirling
him
like
a
leaf
in
storm
he
spoke
with
a
suddenness
startling
to
himself
what
is
between
us
is
all
this
fog
of
damnable
ideas
that
has
arisen
in
the
last
twenty
years
if
it
was
for
that
you
would
marry
me
hagar
took
the
jade
buddha
from
the
table
and
weighed
it
in
her
hands
oh
give
me
patience
she
murmured
he
rose
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
the
physical
the
passionate
side
of
him
was
in
storm
he
was
not
for
nothing
a
coltsworth
coltsworths
were
dominating
people
they
were
masterful
they
wished
to
prevail
body
and
point
of
view
point
of
view
perhaps
no
less
than
body
they
were
not
content
to
have
their
scheme
of
life
and
to
allow
another
a
like
liberty
their
scheme
must
lie
upon
and
smother
under
the
other
they
wished
submissiveness
of
mind
the
other
person
mind
they
wished
it
in
their
relations
with
men
ralph
himself
preferred
subservient
officials
subservient
secretaries
subservient
boards
subservient
legislators
he
preferred
men
to
listen
in
the
club
he
liked
a
deferential
murmur
from
his
acquaintance
he
had
followers
whom
he
called
friends
a
certain
number
of
these
truly
admired
him
he
was
to
them
feudal
and
splendid
he
was
a
coltsworth
and
coltsworths
liked
to
dominate
the
minds
and
fortunes
of
men
when
it
came
to
collective
womankind
they
might
have
said
that
they
had
really
never
considered
the
question
naturally
men
dominated
women
to
them
god
was
male
they
would
have
agreed
with
the
kentucky
editor
that
the
feminist
movement
was
an
audacious
attempt
to
change
the
sex
of
deity
the
thing
that
angered
the
coltsworths
through
and
through
was
revolt
political
economic
intellectual
spiritual
revolt
was
revolt
whatever
adjective
went
before
rage
boiled
up
in
the
mind
of
the
master
and
when
the
revolted
was
not
perturbed
or
anxious
or
fluttered
but
stood
aloof
and
was
aloof
when
the
revolt
was
successful
when
the
rebellion
had
become
revolution
and
the
new
flag
was
up
and
the
citadel
impregnable
the
sense
of
wrath
and
injury
overflowed
like
the
waves
of
phlegethon
it
overflowed
now
with
ralph
he
turned
from
the
window
all
this
rebellion
of
women
is
unthinkable
hagar
looked
at
him
somewhat
dreamily
however
it
has
occurred
things
ca
change
like
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
they
have
changed
she
sat
and
smiled
at
him
quite
eluding
him
a
long
way
off
do
you
think
that
only
mind
in
man
rebels
mind
in
woman
does
it
too
and
it
comes
about
that
there
are
always
more
rebels
men
and
women
we
are
quite
numerous
but
there
are
women
who
do
not
rebel
as
there
are
men
there
are
many
women
who
will
grant
you
your
every
premise
who
are
horrified
in
company
with
you
horrified
at
us
others
why
do
you
not
wish
to
mate
among
your
own
kind
i
wish
to
mate
with
she
shook
her
head
that
you
can
not
do
there
is
being
drawn
a
line
some
men
and
women
are
on
one
side
of
it
and
some
men
and
women
are
on
the
other
side
of
it
there
is
taking
place
a
in
the
things
that
make
the
difference
you
are
where
you
were
when
troy
fell
i
can
not
go
back
down
all
those
slopes
of
time
i
am
afire
for
you
you
wake
in
me
no
answering
fire
she
rose
i
will
talk
about
much
with
you
but
i
will
talk
no
longer
about
love
you
may
take
your
choice
stay
and
talk
as
my
old
playmate
and
cousin
or
say
and
if
i
go
said
ralph
hoarsely
i
shall
not
come
again
i
shall
not
ask
you
again
ralph
ralph
do
you
think
i
shall
weep
for
that
you
do
think
that
i
shall
weep
for
that
you
are
mad
by
god
said
ralph
and
quivered
i
wish
that
we
were
together
in
a
dark
wood
i
wish
that
you
were
in
a
captured
city
and
i
was
coming
through
the
broken
gate
suddenly
he
crossed
the
few
feet
between
them
caught
and
crushed
her
in
his
arms
bruising
her
lips
with
his
just
be
a
woman
you
dark
rich
thing
with
wings
hagar
had
a
physical
strength
for
which
he
was
unprepared
exerting
it
she
freed
herself
and
in
the
same
instant
and
as
deliberately
as
swiftly
struck
him
across
the
face
with
her
open
hand
to
you
she
said
in
a
thrilling
voice
they
stared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
across
space
then
hagar
said
quietly
you
had
better
go
ralph
he
went
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
she
stood
very
still
for
a
few
moments
her
eyes
upon
the
pine
bough
the
excess
of
colour
slowly
ebbed
from
her
face
the
anger
died
in
her
eyes
oh
all
of
us
poor
struggling
souls
she
said
obeying
some
inner
impulse
she
first
lowered
then
extinguished
the
lights
in
the
room
and
moved
to
one
of
the
windows
she
threw
up
the
sash
and
the
keen
autumnal
night
streamed
in
upon
her
the
was
low
and
broad
she
sat
there
with
her
head
thrown
back
against
the
frame
and
let
the
night
and
the
high
starry
heaven
and
the
moving
air
absorb
and
lift
her
it
was
very
clear
and
there
seemed
depths
on
depths
above
hyades
and
pleiades
and
the
charioteer
and
andromeda
bound
and
perseus
climbing
the
steep
sky
we
are
all
bound
and
limited
we
are
all
on
the
lower
slopes
of
time
down
in
the
fens
with
the
lower
nature
it
is
only
a
question
of
more
or
less
aspiration
born
and
strengthening
or
aspiration
yet
in
the
womb
then
what
room
for
anger
because
another
is
where
i
have
been
because
another
coming
upward
rests
awhile
in
the
dungeon
that
was
also
mine
perhaps
it
was
yesterday
perhaps
it
was
ages
ago
where
i
am
will
seem
dungeon
enough
to
that
which
one
day
i
shall
be
and
so
with
him
and
so
with
us
all
a
month
after
this
she
found
among
her
letters
one
morning
four
smoothly
ecstatic
pages
from
sylvie
carter
ralph
had
asked
sylvie
to
marry
him
and
sylvie
had
said
yes
sylvie
wrote
that
she
expected
to
be
very
happy
and
that
she
was
going
to
do
her
best
to
make
ralph
so
too
the
next
day
brought
a
from
ralph
it
stated
that
something
hagar
had
said
had
set
him
to
thinking
she
had
said
that
there
was
being
a
line
drawn
and
that
some
men
and
some
women
were
finding
themselves
together
on
either
side
he
thought
there
was
truth
in
it
and
that
after
all
one
should
marry
within
one
class
otherwise
a
perpetual
clash
of
opinions
fatal
to
love
there
followed
a
terse
announcement
of
his
engagement
to
sylvie
and
he
signed
himself
your
affectionate
cousin
ralph
coltsworth
but
it
was
old
miss
whose
letter
was
wholly
aggrieved
and
indignant
chapter
xxxiii
gilead
balm
the
second
letter
from
old
miss
came
in
february
the
colonel
had
suddenly
failed
and
taken
to
his
bed
old
miss
believed
that
he
would
get
up
again
there
was
she
said
no
reason
why
he
should
but
in
the
mean
time
there
he
lay
he
was
a
little
wandering
in
his
mind
and
he
had
taken
to
thinking
that
hagar
was
in
the
house
and
a
little
girl
still
and
demanding
to
see
her
old
miss
suggested
that
she
should
come
to
gilead
balm
she
went
at
once
on
the
train
thundering
south
through
a
snowy
night
she
lay
awake
until
half
of
her
journey
was
over
scenes
and
moments
occurrences
of
the
outer
and
inner
life
went
by
her
mind
like
some
endless
shifting
tapestry
childhood
girlhood
womanhood
work
and
play
the
daily
material
task
and
the
inner
lift
lift
and
knowledge
of
the
impalpable
that
last
was
not
tapestry
it
was
height
and
breadth
and
depth
and
something
more
the
old
wide
travel
came
back
to
her
shifting
gleams
of
eastern
cities
deserts
temples
mountains
vineyards
haunted
groves
endless
surrounding
azure
murmuring
seas
medway
and
helmeted
in
his
rolling
chair
the
whistle
shrieked
the
train
stopped
with
a
jar
at
some
lighted
station
then
regathering
its
forces
rushed
and
roared
on
through
the
february
night
now
it
was
the
last
three
years
and
more
they
passed
in
panorama
before
her
stages
and
stairways
and
scaffoldings
by
which
the
might
mount
an
inch
ferments
and
leavens
voices
telling
of
democracy
and
fair
play
and
care
for
your
neighbour
freedom
as
for
your
own
your
and
your
through
her
mind
ran
all
the
enormous
detail
of
the
work
being
pursued
over
all
the
country
countless
meetings
speeches
appeals
talks
to
a
dozen
gathered
together
or
to
two
or
three
letters
and
letters
and
letters
press
and
magazine
utterances
organization
the
difficult
raising
of
money
legislative
work
petitions
canvassing
drudgery
in
myriad
detail
letters
and
letters
voice
and
pen
and
all
the
opposition
blind
bigotry
to
be
met
and
a
maniac
fear
of
change
inertia
tradition
habit
the
dead
past
hand
cold
and
heavy
and
all
the
interested
opposition
the
things
whose
book
the
movement
did
not
suit
and
all
the
lethargy
of
womankind
itself
and
in
the
very
camp
in
the
huge
chaotic
movement
itself
as
in
all
the
past
vast
human
movements
recurring
frictions
antagonisms
small
jealousies
flags
set
up
by
individuals
pacifications
and
smoothings
bringing
compatibles
together
keeping
incompatibles
apart
a
contending
with
outer
oppositions
and
inner
weaknesses
resisting
discouragement
fighting
cynicism
acknowledging
the
vast
road
to
travel
keeping
on
she
knew
nothing
that
was
at
once
so
weak
and
so
mighty
as
the
woman
movement
one
who
was
deep
within
it
might
feel
at
times
a
vast
weariness
impatience
and
despair
but
deep
within
it
you
never
left
it
here
you
dealt
with
clay
that
was
so
cold
and
lumpish
it
seemed
that
no
generous
idea
could
germinate
within
here
you
dealt
with
stuff
so
friable
light
and
disintegrative
that
the
thought
would
come
that
it
were
better
to
cast
it
to
the
winds
but
you
did
not
you
comforted
your
soul
with
the
very
much
that
was
noble
and
you
hoped
for
the
other
that
was
not
yet
noble
and
you
went
on
went
on
it
was
all
you
yourself
you
had
within
you
the
intractable
clay
and
the
stuff
light
as
chaff
inconsequent
but
you
went
on
transmuting
lifting
there
was
no
other
hope
no
other
course
deep
down
no
other
wish
so
with
the
woman
movement
another
station
hagar
looked
out
at
the
lights
and
the
hurrying
forms
then
as
the
train
roared
into
the
white
countryside
at
what
could
be
seen
of
the
fields
and
hills
and
trees
she
was
thinking
now
of
gilead
balm
and
her
childhood
and
her
mother
she
seemed
to
lie
again
close
beside
maria
on
the
big
sofa
at
last
she
slept
lying
so
captain
bob
and
lisa
met
her
at
the
station
three
miles
from
gilead
balm
captain
bob
had
a
doleful
mien
oh
yes
the
better
but
i
do
think
he
so
much
better
he
getting
old
and
lisa
and
i
are
getting
old
too
are
we
old
girl
old
like
luna
and
going
away
pretty
soon
like
luna
well
gipsy
you
looking
natural
no
it
been
an
open
winter
down
here
not
much
snow
he
put
her
in
the
carriage
and
they
drove
slowly
to
gilead
balm
over
the
heavy
country
road
old
miss
was
well
serena
was
well
captain
bob
himself
had
had
rheumatism
but
he
was
the
colonel
did
look
badly
it
was
only
that
he
did
seem
to
want
to
get
out
of
bed
and
that
every
little
while
he
set
the
clock
back
and
rambled
on
about
things
and
people
it
creepy
to
hear
him
said
captain
bob
he
thinks
young
bude
is
old
bude
and
he
thinks
that
maria
is
alive
and
that
she
wo
let
you
come
into
the
room
and
then
it
change
like
that
and
he
just
as
much
himself
as
he
ever
was
more
so
in
hi
let
that
rooster
alone
the
house
cedars
showed
over
the
brown
hills
bude
wanted
old
miss
to
get
a
trained
nurse
because
somebody
got
more
or
less
to
watch
at
night
but
old
miss
would
hear
to
it
she
do
approve
of
women
training
for
nurses
so
she
got
young
phoebe
and
isham
second
wife
and
i
think
myself
said
captain
bob
that
i
would
want
a
young
white
woman
that
i
could
order
round
red
brick
and
brown
fields
and
the
of
many
cedars
here
was
gilead
balm
looking
just
as
it
used
to
look
of
a
february
the
air
was
cold
and
still
the
day
a
grey
one
the
smoke
from
the
chimneys
moving
upward
sluggishly
miss
serena
came
down
the
porch
steps
and
greeted
hagar
as
she
stepped
from
the
carriage
yes
your
old
room
did
you
have
a
tiresome
journey
is
your
trunk
coming
then
i
send
it
up
as
soon
as
they
bring
it
young
phoebe
you
take
miss
hagar
bag
up
to
her
room
the
fire
lighted
hagar
and
mimy
shall
make
you
a
cup
of
coffee
we
glad
to
see
you
the
old
room
her
mother
and
her
own
hagar
had
not
been
in
it
in
for
a
long
while
when
phoebe
was
gone
she
sat
in
the
winged
chair
by
the
fire
and
regarded
the
familiar
and
the
old
carved
wardrobe
and
the
bed
and
the
sofa
where
maria
had
lain
and
between
the
dimity
curtains
at
the
windows
the
winter
landscape
the
fire
was
bright
and
danced
in
the
old
mahogany
the
old
chintz
covers
were
upon
the
chair
and
sofa
the
old
pattern
only
the
hues
faded
hagar
rose
took
off
her
travelling
dress
bathed
and
put
on
a
dark
silken
she
took
the
pins
from
her
hair
and
let
it
stream
it
was
like
maria
she
stood
for
a
moment
her
eyes
upon
the
pallid
day
the
rusty
cedars
without
the
window
then
she
went
to
the
chintz
sofa
and
lay
down
in
the
firelight
piling
the
pillows
behind
her
head
taking
the
posture
that
oftenest
in
her
memory
she
saw
maria
take
her
mother
was
present
with
her
there
came
an
expression
into
her
face
that
was
her
mother
old
miss
knocked
at
the
door
and
entered
without
waiting
for
the
come
in
hagar
rose
and
embraced
her
grandmother
then
old
miss
sat
down
in
the
winged
chair
and
her
granddaughter
went
back
to
the
sofa
the
two
gazed
at
each
other
hagar
did
not
know
that
she
looked
like
maria
and
old
miss
did
not
examine
the
springs
and
sources
of
a
mounting
anger
and
sense
of
injury
she
sat
very
straight
with
her
knitting
in
her
hand
wearing
a
cap
upon
her
smoothly
parted
hair
in
which
there
were
yet
strands
of
brown
wearing
a
black
stuff
skirt
and
shoes
over
white
stockings
comely
yet
and
as
ever
authoritative
i
am
so
very
sorry
about
grandfather
said
hagar
uncle
bob
thinks
he
is
better
yes
he
is
better
he
will
be
well
presently
i
should
not
said
old
miss
coldly
have
written
asking
you
to
come
but
that
bude
advised
it
i
was
very
glad
to
come
bude
is
by
no
means
the
man
his
father
was
the
age
is
degenerate
and
so
said
old
miss
sylvie
maine
has
taken
the
prize
right
from
under
your
hand
oh
said
hagar
the
corners
of
her
lips
rose
her
look
that
had
been
rather
still
and
brooding
broke
into
sunshine
if
you
call
it
that
i
hope
that
ralph
and
sylvie
will
be
very
happy
they
will
probably
be
extraordinarily
happy
she
is
not
one
of
your
new
women
i
detest
said
old
miss
grimly
your
new
women
silence
hagar
lay
back
against
the
pillows
and
she
looked
more
and
more
to
old
miss
like
maria
old
miss
needles
clicked
when
may
i
see
grandfather
asked
hagar
and
she
kept
her
voice
friendly
and
quiet
he
is
sleeping
now
when
he
wakes
up
if
he
asks
for
you
you
may
go
in
i
would
stay
and
what
have
you
been
doing
this
winter
various
things
grandmother
thomasine
and
i
have
been
working
pretty
hard
thomasine
sent
her
regards
to
every
one
at
gilead
balm
if
you
had
thrown
away
medway
million
dollars
you
would
have
had
to
work
said
old
miss
maria
was
perfectly
spendthrift
and
of
course
you
take
after
what
kind
of
work
do
you
mean
you
have
been
doing
i
have
been
writing
of
course
and
then
other
work
connected
with
movements
in
which
i
am
interested
old
miss
needles
clicked
again
unsexing
women
and
unsettling
the
minds
of
i
saw
a
piece
in
a
paper
preposterous
but
it
just
what
maria
would
have
liked
to
have
done
silence
again
then
hagar
leaned
across
and
took
up
her
work
what
is
it
an
afghan
it
lovely
soft
wool
when
asked
old
miss
are
you
going
to
marry
and
whom
i
do
not
know
grandmother
that
i
am
going
to
marry
or
whom
you
should
have
married
ralph
all
these
years
have
you
had
any
other
offers
yes
grandmother
while
you
were
with
medway
yes
grandmother
have
you
had
any
since
you
set
up
in
this
remarkable
way
for
yourself
hagar
laughed
no
grandmother
unless
you
except
ralph
ha
said
old
miss
in
grim
triumph
i
knew
you
would
miss
serena
came
to
the
door
father
awake
and
he
wants
to
see
hagar
but
when
hagar
went
down
and
into
the
big
room
and
up
to
the
great
bed
the
colonel
declared
her
to
be
maria
grew
excited
and
said
that
she
should
keep
his
grandchild
from
him
i
tell
you
woman
medway
and
i
are
going
to
use
authority
the
child
medway
medway
next
of
kin
by
every
law
in
the
land
he
can
take
her
from
you
and
by
god
he
shall
do
it
father
said
miss
serena
this
is
hagar
grown
up
but
the
colonel
grew
violently
angry
you
are
all
lying
a
family
conspiring
against
him
that
woman
my
my
son
wife
dependent
on
me
for
her
bread
and
shelter
and
setting
up
her
will
against
mine
and
now
she
all
for
keeping
from
me
my
grandchild
she
hiding
gipsy
in
closets
and
under
the
stairs
you
have
no
right
it
not
your
child
it
medway
child
that
law
you
ought
to
be
whipped
grandfather
said
hagar
do
you
remember
alexandria
and
the
mosques
and
the
place
mahomet
ali
why
exactly
said
the
colonel
well
gipsy
we
always
wanted
to
travel
did
we
that
dragoman
seems
to
know
his
business
going
down
to
cairo
and
out
to
see
the
pyramids
want
to
come
along
day
followed
day
at
gilead
balm
sometimes
the
colonel
mind
wandered
over
the
seas
of
creation
with
the
pilot
asleep
at
the
helm
sometimes
the
pilot
suddenly
awoke
though
it
was
not
apt
to
be
for
long
it
was
eerie
when
the
pilot
awoke
when
he
suddenly
sat
there
gaunt
with
a
parchment
face
and
nose
and
straying
white
hair
and
in
a
cool
drawling
voice
asked
intelligent
questions
about
the
hour
and
the
season
and
the
plantation
happenings
at
such
times
if
hagar
were
not
already
in
the
room
he
demanded
to
see
her
she
came
sat
by
him
in
the
great
chair
offered
to
read
to
him
he
was
not
infrequently
willing
for
her
to
do
this
she
read
both
prose
and
verse
to
him
this
winter
sometimes
he
did
not
wish
her
to
read
he
wanted
to
talk
when
this
was
the
case
the
pilot
being
awake
it
was
her
life
away
from
gilead
balm
that
he
oftenest
chose
to
comment
upon
that
he
knew
the
content
of
her
life
hardly
at
all
mattered
as
little
to
the
colonel
as
it
mattered
to
old
miss
and
miss
serena
they
were
going
to
let
fly
their
arrows
if
there
was
no
target
in
the
direction
in
which
they
shot
at
least
they
were
in
sublime
ignorance
of
the
fact
hagar
let
them
talk
not
only
the
colonel
gilead
balm
was
dying
in
the
middle
of
a
sarcastic
sentence
the
pilot
would
drop
asleep
again
in
a
moment
the
barque
was
at
the
mercy
of
every
wandering
wind
hagar
became
maria
and
he
gibbered
at
her
young
bude

went

old
and
passed
into
march

cold
and
sunny
with

by
april
came
with
tender
light
with
judas
trees
and
bloodroot
and
the
white
cherry
trees
in
a
mist
of
bloom
and
still
the
colonel
lay
there
and
now
the
pilot
waked
and
now
the
pilot
slept
may
came
bude
stayed
in
the
house
one
evening
at
dusk
the
colonel
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
upon
his
family
gathered
about
his
bed
old
miss
was
sitting
upright
and
still
in
the
great
chair
at
the
miss
serena
had
a
low
chair
at
the
foot
and
captain
bob
was
near
his
old
grey
head
buried
in
his
hands
there
was
also
an
ashendyne
close
kinsman
and
a
coltsworth
not
ralph

waited
in
the
background
hagar
stood
behind

them
and
after
the
railroad
there
be
something
else
public
schools
too
this
country
getting
too
damnably
democratic
his
eyes
closed
his
face
seemed
to
sink
together
bude
came
from
the
hearth
and
bending
over
laid
his
finger
upon
the
pulse
the
colonel
again
opened
his
eyes
they
were
fastened
now
on
hagar
standing
behind
miss
serena
well
gipsy
he
said
with
cheerfulness
it
a
pretty
comfortable
boat
eh
we
make
the
voyage
before
we
know
it
his
hands
touched
the
bed
steamer

do

i
was
ever
in
one
before
lean
back
and
see
the
wide
ocean
stretch
before
you
the
wide
ocean
the
wide
ocean
on
thou
deep
and
dark
blue

roll
that
byron
you
know
gipsy
the
wide

his
eyes
glazed
he
sank
back
bude
touched
the
wrist
again

straightening
himself
turned
and
spoke
to
old
miss
chapter
xxxiv
brittany
she
has
had
a
holiday
for
nearly
four
years
said
molly
i
glad
she
gone
for
this
summer
she
would
take
thomasine
she
said
she
wanted
to
be
all
all
alone
just
for
three
months
then
she
would
come
back
to
work
brittany
yes
a
little
place
on
the
coast
that
she
knew
she
said
she
wanted
the
sea
i
thought
perhaps
that
she
had
written
to
you
not
since
may
said
john
fay
there
was
a
proposed
extension
of
a
piece
of
work
of
mine
in
the
west
i
was
called
out
there
to
see
about
it
and
i
had
to
go
i
was
kept
for
weeks
i
tried
to
get
back
but
i
could
i
was
in
honour
bound
then
when
i
came
her
boat
had
sailed
and
now
i
he
measured
the
table
with
his
fingers
do
you
think
she
would
hate
me
if
i
turned
up
in
that
place
in
brittany
molly
considered
it
she
a
reasonable
being
brittany
is
for
the
benefit
of
just
one
person
ah
but
you
see
i
should
want
to
talk
to
her
molly
pondered
that
too
well
i
should
try
i
think
if
she
want
to
talk
she
will
tell
you
so
hagar
village
was
a
small
village
a
grey
patch
of
houses
set
like
a
lichen
against
a
cliff
with
a
heath
above
before
it
ran
a
great
and
far
stretch
of
brown
sands
there
was
a
tiny
harbour
where
the
came
in
and
all
beyond
the
thundering
sea
the
place
boasted
a
small
inn
but
she
did
not
stay
there
the
widow
of
the
cur√©
had
to
let
a
clean
large
room
overlooking
a
windy
garden
and
the
widow
and
her
one
servant
set
a
table
with
simple
fare
hagar
stayed
here
though
most
of
the
time
indeed
she
stayed
out
upon
the
brown
sands
she
walked
for
miles
or
down
with
the
women
at
evening
she
watched
the
boats
come
one
by
one
to
haven
or
far
from
the
village
beneath
some
heap
of
sand
she
sat
with
her
hands
about
her
knees
and
watched
the
shifting
colour
of
the
sea
she
had
a
book
with
her
sometimes
she
read
in
it
and
sometimes
it
lay
unopened
all
the
colours
went
over
the
sea
the
surf
murmured
the
flew
the
salt
wind
bent
the
sparse
grass
at
the
top
of
the
dune
on
such
an
afternoon
after
long
motionless
dreaming
she
changed
her
posture
turning
her
eyes
toward
the
distant
village
a
man
was
walking
toward
her
over
the
firm
sand
she
watched
him
at
first
dreamily
then
suddenly
with
a
quickened
breath
while
the
distance
between
them
was
yet
great
she
knew
it
to
be
fay
he
came
up
to
her
and
held
out
his
hand
she
put
hers
in
it
did
i
startle
you
he
said
if
you
do
want
me
i
will
go
away
i
thought
you
were
in
the
west
i
could
get
away
at
last
i
crossed
the
atlantic
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
do
you
mind
very
much
do
i
mind
seeing
you
here
in
brittany
no
i
do
not
know
that
i
mind
that
sit
down
and
tell
me
about
america
america
has
seemed
so
far
away
these
still
still
days
farther
away
than
the
sun
and
the
moon
long
and
with
his
eyes
and
quizzical
look
fay
threw
himself
down
upon
the
sand
beside
her
they
talked
that
day
of
people
at
home
of
the
work
he
had
been
doing
and
of
her
long
absence
at
gilead
balm
she
made
him
see
the
place
the
old
man
who
had
died
and
old
miss
and
miss
serena
and
captain
bob
and
the
servants
and
lisa
they
are
going
to
live
on
there
yes
just
as
they
have
done
until
they
too
die
oh
gilead
balm
late
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
making
a
red
path
across
the
waters
and
the
boats
growing
larger
coming
toward
the
land
they
walked
back
to
the
village
together
he
left
her
at
the
door
of
the
cur√©
house
he
himself
was
staying
at
the
inn
she
did
not
ask
him
how
long
he
would
stay
or
if
he
was
on
his
way
to
other
larger
places
the
situation
accepted
itself
there
followed
some
days
of
wandering
together
through
the
little
grey
town
or
over
the
green
headland
to
a
country
beyond
of
pine
trees
and
druid
stones
or
in
the
evening
light
along
the
sands
they
found
a
sailboat
with
an
old
hale
boatman
for
hire
and
they
went
out
in
this
boat
sometimes
the
wind
carried
them
along
swift
as
a
leaf
sometimes
they
went
as
in
a
so
dreamily
the
boatman
knew
all
the
legends
of
the
sea
he
told
them
stories
of
the
king
of
ys
and
the
false
ah√©s
and
then
he
talked
of
the
pardons
of
his
youth
sometimes
they
skirted
the
coast
sometimes
they
went
so
far
out
that
the
land
was
but
an
shadow
the
next
day
perhaps
they
wandered
inland
over
the
heath
among
dolmens
and
menhirs
or
seated
on
old
wreckage
upon
the
sands
the
dark
blue
sea
before
them
now
they
talked
and
now
they
kept
company
with
silence
they
talked
little
rather
than
much
the
place
was
taciturn
and
her
mood
made
for
quiet
it
was
not
until
the
fourth
day
that
he
told
her
for
what
he
had
come
but
you
know
for
what
i
came
yes
i
know
if
you
could
i
want
said
hagar
more
time
will
you
let
it
all
rest
for
a
little
longer
i
do
think
i
could
tell
you
truly
as
long
as
you
wish
he
said
if
only
in
the
end
two
days
after
this
they
went
out
in
the
afternoon
in
the
boat
it
had
been
a
warm
day
with
murk
in
the
air
at
the
little
fay
after
a
glance
at
the
dim
hot
arch
of
the
sky
asked
the
boatman
if
bad
weather
might
be
brewing
but
the
breton
was
positive
nothing
nothing
perhaps
they
went
sailing
far
out
until
the
land
sunk
from
sight
an
hour
or
two
passed
pleasantly
pleasantly
then
suddenly
the
wind
where
they
were
dropped
like
a
stone
they
lay
for
an
hour
with
flapping
sail
and
watched
the
blue
sky
grow
pallid
and
then
darken
a
puff
of
wind
hot
and
heavy
lifted
the
hair
from
their
brows
it
increased
the
sky
darkened
yet
more
with
an
appalling
might
and
swiftness
the
worst
storm
of
the
burst
upon
them
the
wind
blew
a
hurricane
the
sea
rose
suddenly
the
mast
went
fay
and
the
breton
battled
with
the
wreckage
cut
it
loose
the
boat
righted
but
she
had
shipped
water
and
her
timbers
were
straining
and
creaking
the
wind
was
whipping
her
away
to
the
open
sea
and
the
waves
continually
mounting
battered
her
side
there
was
a
perceptible
list
night
was
oncoming
and
the
fury
above
increasing
hagar
braided
her
long
hair
that
the
wind
had
loosened
from
its
fastening
we
are
in
danger
she
said
to
fay
yes
can
you
swim
yes
but
there
would
be
no
long
swimming
in
this
sea
they
sat
in
the
darkness
of
the
storm
when
the
lightnings
flashed
each
had
a
vision
of
the
other
face
tense
and
still
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
the
sailor
who
was
hardy
enough
now
muttered
prayers
and
now
objurgations
upon
the
faithless
weather
he
tried
to
assure
his
passengers
that
not
anne
herself
could
have
foreseen
what
was
going
to
occur
that
afternoon
certainly
jean
gouillou
had
not
that
understood
said
hagar
smiling
at
him
in
a
flash
of
lightning
and
just
do
your
best
now
said
fay
the
wild
storm
continued
wind
and
wave
tossed
and
drove
the
helpless
boat
now
it
laboured
in
the
black
trough
of
the
waves
now
it
staggered
upon
the
summits
and
always
it
laboured
more
heavily
and
always
it
was
more
laggard
in
rising
the
breton
and
fay
took
turns
in
bailing
the
water
out
it
was
now
save
for
the
lightning
dark
night
at
last
it
was
seen
though
still
they
worked
on
that
there
was
little
use
in
bailing
the
boat
grew
heavier
more
distressed
the
sea
was
running
high
some
wave
will
swamp
us
yes
it
is
a
matter
of
time
and
not
long
time
i
think
hagar
put
out
her
hands
to
him
then
i
will
tell
you
now
he
took
her
hands
is
it
your
answer
yes
my
dear
yes
my
dear
they
bent
toward
each
other
their
lips
met
now
whether
we
live
or
whether
we
die
the
wild
storm
continued
the
slow
sands
of
the
night
ran
on
and
still
the
boat
lived
though
always
more
weakly
with
the
end
more
certainly
before
her
the
breton
crossed
himself
and
prayed
hagar
and
fay
sat
close
together
hand
in
hand
after
midnight
the
storm
suddenly
decreased
in
force
the
lightning
and
thunder
ceased
the
clouds
began
to
part
in
another
hour
there
would
be
a
sky
all
stars
the
wind
that
had
been
so
loud
and
wild
sank
to
a
lingering
steady
moaning
there
was
left
the
tumultuous
lifted
sea
and
the
boat
sunken
now
almost
to
her
gunwales
fay
spoke
in
a
low
voice
are
you
afraid
of
death
no
you
can
not
kill
life
it
will
not
be
painful
going
as
we
shall
go
if
it
is
to
happen
and
to
go
together
i
am
glad
that
we
are
going
together
seeing
that
we
are
to
go
do
you
believe
that
when
it
is
over
we
shall
be
together
still
consciously
together
yes
i
do
not
know
no
one
knows
no
one
can
know
yet
but
i
have
faith
that
we
shall
persist
and
that
intelligently
i
do
not
think
that
we
shall
forget
or
ignore
our
old
selves
and
if
we
wish
to
be
together
and
we
do
wish
it
then
i
think
we
may
have
power
to
compass
it
it
has
sometimes
seemed
to
me
said
fay
that
after
death
may
prove
to
be
just
life
with
something
like
fourth
dimensional
powers
all
this
life
a
memory
as
of
childhood
and
a
power
and
freedom
and
scope
undreamed
of
now
it
is
possible
all
things
are
possible
save
i
think
too
it
will
be
higher
more
spiritual
at
any
rate
i
do
not
fear
i
feel
awe
as
before
something
unknown
and
high
and
i
the
same
off
in
the
east
the
stars
were
paling
there
was
coming
a
vague
and
mournful
grey
the
boat
was
sinking
the
two
men
had
torn
away
the
thwarts
and
with
a
piece
of
rope
lashed
them
together
it
would
be
little
more
than
a
straw
to
cling
to
in
the
turbulent
wide
ocean
miles
from
land
all
were
cold
and
numbed
with
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
the
sea
purple
streaks
came
into
the
east
a
chill
and
solemn
lift
to
all
the
sea
and
air
and
the
roofless
ether
hagar
and
fay
looked
at
the
violet
light
at
the
extreme
and
ghostly
calm
of
the
fields
of
dawn
it
is
coming
now
said
fay
and
put
his
arm
around
her
the
boat
sank
the
three
clinging
to
the
frail
raft
they
had
provided
were
swung
from
wave
to
wave
beneath
the
glowing
dawn
the
wind
was
stilled
now
the
water
under
the
rising
sun
smoothed
itself
out
they
drifted
drifted
and
now
the
sun
was
an
hour
high
look
look
cried
the
breton
and
they
looked
and
saw
a
red
sail
coming
toward
them
a
day
or
two
later
hagar
and
fay
met
at
the
gate
of
the
cur√©
widow
and
climbing
through
the
grey
town
came
out
upon
the
heath
above
it
was
a
high
clear
afternoon
with
a
marvellous
blue
sky
they
walked
until
they
came
to
a
circle
of
stones
raised
there
in
the
immemorial
dark
past
when
they
had
wandered
among
them
for
a
while
they
rested
leaning
against
the
greatest
menhir
looking
out
over
the
heath
to
a
line
of
sapphire
sea
it
grows
like
a
dream
said
hagar
death
life
life
death
i
think
we
are
growing
into
something
that
transcends
both
as
we
have
known
both
hagar
do
you
love
me
yes
i
love
you
it
a
quiet
love
but
it
deep
they
sat
down
in
the
warm
grass
by
the
huge
stone
and
now
they
talked
and
now
they
were
silent
and
content
little
by
little
they
laid
their
plans
let
us
go
to
london
i
will
go
to
roger
michael
we
will
marry
quietly
there
lily
and
robert
will
want
to
come
from
scotland
well
we
let
them
hagar
laughed
a
musical
sweet
laugh
thomson
is
in
london
with
greer
dear
old
thomson
i
think
he
have
to
come
could
we
have
said
fay
a
month
in
some
old
green
still
english
country
place
with
roses
to
the
eaves
and
a
sunken
lane
to
wander
in
and
at
night
a
cricket
chirping
on
the
hearth
we
try
and
in
october
sail
for
home
and
in
october
sail
for
home
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
smiled
and
yet
were
grave
