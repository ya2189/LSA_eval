i
heard
a

blended
notes
while
in

i
sate
reclined
in
that

when
pleasant
thoughts
bring
sad
thoughts
to
the
mind
her
fair
works
did
nature
link
the
human
soul
that
through

ran
and
much
it
grieved
my
heart
to
think
what
man
has
made
of
wordsworth
picture
little
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
and
his
name
was
tom
that
is
a
short
name
and
you
have
heard
it
before
so
you
will
not
have
much
trouble
in
remembering
it
he
lived
in
a
great
town
in
the
north
country
where
there
were
plenty
of
chimneys
to
sweep
and
plenty
of
money
for
tom
to
earn
and
his
master
to
spend
he
could
not
read
nor
write
and
did
not
care
to
do
either
and
he
never
washed
himself
for
there
was
no
water
up
the
court
where
he
lived
he
had
never
been
taught
to
say
his
prayers
he
never
had
heard
of
god
or
of
christ
except
in
words
which
you
never
have
heard
and
which
it
would
have
been
well
if
he
had
never
heard
he
cried
half
his
time
and
laughed
the
other
half
he
cried
when
he
had
to
climb
the
dark
flues
rubbing
his
poor
knees
and
elbows
raw
and
when
the
soot
got
into
his
eyes
which
it
did
every
day
in
the
week
and
when
his
master
beat
him
which
he
did
every
day
in
the
week
and
when
he
had
not
enough
to
eat
which
happened
every
day
in
the
week
likewise
and
he
laughed
the
other
half
of
the
day
when
he
was
tossing
halfpennies
with
the
other
boys
or
playing
over
the
posts
or
bowling
stones
at
the
legs
as
they
trotted
by
which
last
was
excellent
fun
when
there
was
a
wall
at
hand
behind
which
to
hide
picture
dogs
as
for
and
being
hungry
and
being
beaten
he
took
all
that
for
the
way
of
the
world
like
the
rain
and
snow
and
thunder
and
stood
manfully
with
his
back
to
it
till
it
was
over
as
his
old
donkey
did
to
a
and
then
shook
his
ears
and
was
as
jolly
as
ever
and
thought
of
the
fine
times
coming
when
he
would
be
a
man
and
a
master
sweep
and
sit
in
the
with
a
quart
of
beer
and
a
long
pipe
and
play
cards
for
silver
money
and
wear
velveteens
and
and
keep
a
white
with
one
gray
ear
and
carry
her
puppies
in
his
pocket
just
like
a
man
and
he
would
have
apprentices
one
two
three
if
he
could
how
he
would
bully
them
and
knock
them
about
just
as
his
master
did
to
him
and
make
them
carry
home
the
soot
sacks
while
he
rode
before
them
on
his
donkey
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
a
flower
in
his
like
a
king
at
the
head
of
his
army
yes
there
were
good
times
coming
and
when
his
master
let
him
have
a
pull
at
the
leavings
of
his
beer
tom
was
the
jolliest
boy
in
the
whole
town
picture
smart
groom
and
tom
one
day
a
smart
little
groom
rode
into
the
court
where
tom
lived
tom
was
just
hiding
behind
a
wall
to
heave
half
a
brick
at
his
legs
as
is
the
custom
of
that
country
when
they
welcome
strangers
but
the
groom
saw
him
and
halloed
to
him
to
know
where
grimes
the
lived
now
grimes
was
own
master
and
tom
was
a
good
man
of
business
and
always
civil
to
customers
so
he
put
the
down
quietly
behind
the
wall
and
proceeded
to
take
orders
grimes
was
to
come
up
next
morning
to
sir
john
at
the
place
for
his
old
was
gone
to
prison
and
the
chimneys
wanted
sweeping
and
so
he
rode
away
not
giving
tom
time
to
ask
what
the
sweep
had
gone
to
prison
for
which
was
a
matter
of
interest
to
tom
as
he
had
been
in
prison
once
or
twice
himself
moreover
the
groom
looked
so
very
neat
and
clean
with
his
drab
gaiters
drab
breeches
drab
jacket
tie
with
a
smart
pin
in
it
and
clean
round
ruddy
face
that
tom
was
offended
and
disgusted
at
his
appearance
and
considered
him
a
fellow
who
gave
himself
airs
because
he
wore
smart
clothes
and
other
people
paid
for
them
and
went
behind
the
wall
to
fetch
the
after
all
but
did
not
remembering
that
he
had
come
in
the
way
of
business
and
was
as
it
were
under
a
flag
of
truce
his
master
was
so
delighted
at
his
new
customer
that
he
knocked
tom
down
out
of
hand
and
drank
more
beer
that
night
than
he
usually
did
in
two
in
order
to
be
sure
of
getting
up
in
time
next
morning
for
the
more
a
head
aches
when
he
wakes
the
more
glad
he
is
to
turn
out
and
have
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
when
he
did
get
up
at
four
the
next
morning
he
knocked
tom
down
again
in
order
to
teach
him
as
young
gentlemen
used
to
be
taught
at
public
schools
that
he
must
be
an
extra
good
boy
that
day
as
they
were
going
to
a
very
great
house
and
might
make
a
very
good
thing
of
it
if
they
could
but
give
satisfaction
and
tom
thought
so
likewise
and
indeed
would
have
done
and
behaved
his
best
even
without
being
knocked
down
for
of
all
places
upon
earth
harthover
place
which
he
had
never
seen
was
the
most
wonderful
and
of
all
men
on
earth
sir
john
whom
he
had
seen
having
been
sent
to
gaol
by
him
twice
was
the
most
awful
picture
sir
john
harthover
harthover
place
was
really
a
grand
place
even
for
the
rich
north
country
with
a
house
so
large
that
in
the
riots
which
tom
could
just
remember
the
duke
of
wellington
and
ten
thousand
soldiers
to
match
were
easily
housed
therein
at
least
so
tom
believed
with
a
park
full
of
deer
which
tom
believed
to
be
monsters
who
were
in
the
habit
of
eating
children
with
miles
of
in
which
grimes
and
the
collier
lads
poached
at
times
on
which
occasions
tom
saw
pheasants
and
wondered
what
they
tasted
like
with
a
noble
in
which
grimes
and
his
friends
would
have
liked
to
poach
but
then
they
must
have
got
into
cold
water
and
that
they
did
not
like
at
all
in
short
harthover
was
a
grand
place
and
sir
john
a
grand
old
man
whom
even
grimes
respected
for
not
only
could
he
send
grimes
to
prison
when
he
deserved
it
as
he
did
once
or
twice
a
week
not
only
did
he
own
all
the
land
about
for
miles
not
only
was
he
a
jolly
honest
sensible
squire
as
ever
kept
a
pack
of
hounds
who
would
do
what
he
thought
right
by
his
neighbours
as
well
as
get
what
he
thought
right
for
himself
but
what
was
more
he
weighed
full
fifteen
stone
was
nobody
knew
how
many
inches
round
the
chest
and
could
have
thrashed
grimes
himself
in
fair
fight
which
very
few
folk
round
there
could
do
and
which
my
dear
little
boy
would
not
have
been
right
for
him
to
do
as
a
great
many
things
are
not
which
one
both
can
do
and
would
like
very
much
to
do
so
grimes
touched
his
hat
to
him
when
he
rode
through
the
town
and
called
him
a
awd
chap
and
his
young
ladies
lasses
which
are
two
high
compliments
in
the
north
country
and
thought
that
that
made
up
for
his
poaching
sir
pheasants
whereby
you
may
perceive
that
grimes
had
not
been
to
a
government
national
school
now
i
dare
say
you
never
got
up
at
three
on
a
midsummer
morning
some
people
get
up
then
because
they
want
to
catch
salmon
and
some
because
they
want
to
climb
alps
and
a
great
many
more
because
they
must
like
tom
but
i
assure
you
that
three
on
a
midsummer
morning
is
the
pleasantest
time
of
all
the
hours
and
all
the
three
hundred
and
days
and
why
every
one
does
not
get
up
then
i
never
could
tell
save
that
they
are
all
determined
to
spoil
their
nerves
and
their
complexions
by
doing
all
night
what
they
might
just
as
well
do
all
day
but
tom
instead
of
going
out
to
dinner
at
eight
at
night
and
to
a
ball
at
ten
and
finishing
off
somewhere
between
twelve
and
four
went
to
bed
at
seven
when
his
master
went
to
the
and
slept
like
a
dead
pig
for
which
reason
he
was
as
piert
as
a
who
always
gets
up
early
to
wake
the
maids
and
just
ready
to
get
up
when
the
fine
gentlemen
and
ladies
were
just
ready
to
go
to
bed
picture
grimes
and
tom
so
he
and
his
master
set
out
grimes
rode
the
donkey
in
front
and
tom
and
the
brushes
walked
behind
out
of
the
court
and
up
the
street
past
the
closed
and
the
winking
weary
policemen
and
the
roofs
all
shining
gray
in
the
gray
dawn
they
passed
through
the
village
all
shut
up
and
silent
now
and
through
the
turnpike
and
then
the
were
out
in
the
real
country
and
plodding
along
the
black
dusty
road
between
black
slag
walls
with
no
sound
but
the
groaning
and
thumping
of
the
in
the
next
field
but
soon
the
road
grew
white
and
the
walls
likewise
and
at
the
foot
grew
long
grass
and
gay
flowers
all
drenched
with
dew
and
instead
of
the
groaning
of
the
they
heard
the
skylark
saying
his
matins
high
up
in
the
air
and
the
warbling
in
the
sedges
as
he
had
warbled
all
night
long
all
else
was
silent
for
old
earth
was
still
fast
asleep
and
like
many
pretty
people
she
looked
still
prettier
asleep
than
awake
the
great
in
the
meadows
were
fast
asleep
above
and
the
cows
fast
asleep
beneath
them
nay
the
few
clouds
which
were
about
were
fast
asleep
likewise
and
so
tired
that
they
had
lain
down
on
the
earth
to
rest
in
long
white
flakes
and
bars
among
the
stems
of
the
and
along
the
tops
of
the
alders
by
the
stream
waiting
for
the
sun
to
bid
them
rise
and
go
about
their
business
in
the
clear
blue
overhead
on
they
went
and
tom
looked
and
looked
for
he
never
had
been
so
far
into
the
country
before
and
longed
to
get
over
a
gate
and
pick
buttercups
and
look
for
nests
in
the
hedge
but
grimes
was
a
man
of
business
and
would
not
have
heard
of
that
soon
they
came
up
with
a
poor
irishwoman
trudging
along
with
a
bundle
at
her
back
she
had
a
gray
shawl
over
her
head
and
a
crimson
madder
petticoat
so
you
may
be
sure
she
came
from
galway
she
had
neither
shoes
nor
stockings
and
limped
along
as
if
she
were
tired
and
footsore
but
she
was
a
very
tall
handsome
woman
with
bright
gray
eyes
and
heavy
black
hair
hanging
about
her
cheeks
and
she
took
fancy
so
much
that
when
he
came
alongside
he
called
out
to
her
picture
the
poor
irishwomen
is
a
hard
road
for
a
gradely
foot
like
that
will
ye
up
lass
and
ride
behind
me
but
perhaps
she
did
not
admire
look
and
voice
for
she
answered
quietly
thank
you
sooner
walk
with
your
little
lad
may
please
yourself
growled
grimes
and
went
on
smoking
so
she
walked
beside
tom
and
talked
to
him
and
asked
him
where
he
lived
and
what
he
knew
and
all
about
himself
till
tom
thought
he
had
never
met
such
a
woman
and
she
asked
him
at
last
whether
he
said
his
prayers
and
seemed
sad
when
he
told
her
that
he
knew
no
prayers
to
say
then
he
asked
her
where
she
lived
and
she
said
far
away
by
the
sea
and
tom
asked
her
about
the
sea
and
she
told
him
how
it
rolled
and
roared
over
the
rocks
in
winter
nights
and
lay
still
in
the
bright
summer
days
for
the
children
to
bathe
and
play
in
it
and
many
a
story
more
till
tom
longed
to
go
and
see
the
sea
and
bathe
in
it
likewise
at
last
at
the
bottom
of
a
hill
they
came
to
a
spring
not
such
a
spring
as
you
see
here
which
soaks
up
out
of
a
white
gravel
in
the
bog
among
red
and
pink
and
sweet
white
orchis
nor
such
a
one
as
you
may
see
too
here
which
bubbles
up
under
the
warm
sandbank
in
the
hollow
lane
by
the
great
tuft
of
lady
ferns
and
makes
the
sand
dance
reels
at
the
bottom
day
and
night
all
the
year
round
not
such
a
spring
as
either
of
those
but
a
real
north
country
limestone
fountain
like
one
of
those
in
sicily
or
greece
where
the
old
heathen
fancied
the
nymphs
sat
cooling
themselves
the
hot
day
while
the
shepherds
peeped
at
them
from
behind
the
bushes
out
of
a
low
cave
of
rock
at
the
foot
of
a
limestone
crag
the
great
fountain
rose
quelling
and
bubbling
and
gurgling
so
clear
that
you
could
not
tell
where
the
water
ended
and
the
air
began
and
ran
away
under
the
road
a
stream
large
enough
to
turn
a
mill
among
blue
geranium
and
golden
and
wild
raspberry
and
the
with
its
tassels
of
snow
and
there
grimes
stopped
and
looked
and
tom
looked
too
tom
was
wondering
whether
anything
lived
in
that
dark
cave
and
came
out
at
night
to
fly
in
the
meadows
but
grimes
was
not
wondering
at
all
without
a
word
he
got
off
his
donkey
and
clambered
over
the
low
road
wall
and
knelt
down
and
began
dipping
his
ugly
head
into
the
very
dirty
he
made
it
tom
was
picking
the
flowers
as
fast
as
he
could
the
irishwoman
helped
him
and
showed
him
how
to
tie
them
up
and
a
very
pretty
nosegay
they
had
made
between
them
but
when
he
saw
grimes
actually
wash
he
stopped
quite
astonished
and
when
grimes
had
finished
and
began
shaking
his
ears
to
dry
them
he
said
master
i
never
saw
you
do
that
will
again
most
likely
for
cleanliness
i
did
it
but
for
coolness
be
ashamed
to
want
washing
every
week
or
so
like
any
smutty
collier
wish
i
might
go
and
dip
my
head
in
said
poor
little
tom
must
be
as
good
as
putting
it
under
the
and
there
is
no
beadle
here
to
drive
a
chap
come
along
said
grimes
dost
want
with
washing
thyself
thou
did
not
drink
half
a
gallon
of
beer
last
night
like
care
for
you
said
naughty
tom
and
ran
down
to
the
stream
and
began
washing
his
face
grimes
was
very
sulky
because
the
woman
preferred
company
to
his
so
he
dashed
at
him
with
horrid
words
and
tore
him
up
from
his
knees
and
began
beating
him
but
tom
was
accustomed
to
that
and
got
his
head
safe
between
legs
and
kicked
his
shins
with
all
his
might
you
not
ashamed
of
yourself
thomas
grimes
cried
the
irishwoman
over
the
wall
grimes
looked
up
startled
at
her
knowing
his
name
but
all
he
answered
was
nor
never
was
yet
and
went
on
beating

grimes
and
leaving
tom
he
climbed
up
over
the
wall
and
faced
the
woman
tom
thought
he
was
going
to
strike
her
but
she
looked
him
too
full
and
fierce
in
the
face
for
that
i
was
there

the
irishwoman

that

picture
griffin
status
with
shield
saying
and
she
turned
away
and
through
a
gate
into
the
meadow
grimes
stood
still
a
moment
like
a
man
who
had
been
stunned
then
he
rushed
after
her
shouting
come
but
when
he
got
into
the
meadow
the
woman
was
not
there
had
she
hidden
away
there
was
no
place
to
hide
in
but
grimes
looked
about
and
tom
also
for
he
was
as
puzzled
as
grimes
himself
at
her
disappearing
so
suddenly
but
look
where
they
would
she
was
not
there
grimes
came
back
again
as
silent
as
a
post
for
he
was
a
little
frightened
and
getting
on
his
donkey
filled
a
fresh
pipe
and
smoked
away
leaving
tom
in
peace
picture
griffin
status
with
shield
saying
and
now
they
had
gone
three
miles
and
more
and
came
to
sir
very
grand
lodges
they
were
with
very
grand
iron
gates
and
stone
and
on
the
top
of
each
a
most
dreadful
bogy
all
teeth
horns
and
tail
which
was
the
crest
which
sir
ancestors
wore
in
the
wars
of
the
roses
and
very
prudent
men
they
were
to
wear
it
for
all
their
enemies
must
have
run
for
their
lives
at
the
very
first
sight
of
them
grimes
rang
at
the
gate
and
out
came
a
keeper
on
the
spot
and
opened
was
told
to
expect
thee
he
said
be
so
good
as
to
keep
to
the
main
avenue
and
not
let
me
find
a
hare
or
a
rabbit
on
thee
when
thou
comest
back
i
shall
look
sharp
for
one
i
tell
if
in
the
bottom
of
the
quoth
grimes
and
at
that
he
laughed
and
the
keeper
laughed
and
said
thy
sort
i
may
as
well
walk
up
with
thee
to
the
think
thou
best
had
thy
business
to
see
after
thy
game
man
and
not
so
the
keeper
went
with
them
and
to
surprise
he
and
grimes
chatted
together
all
the
way
quite
pleasantly
he
did
not
know
that
a
keeper
is
only
a
poacher
turned
outside
in
and
a
poacher
a
keeper
turned
inside
out
they
walked
up
a
great
lime
avenue
a
full
mile
long
and
between
their
stems
tom
peeped
trembling
at
the
horns
of
the
sleeping
deer
which
stood
up
among
the
ferns
tom
had
never
seen
such
enormous
trees
and
as
he
looked
up
he
fancied
that
the
blue
sky
rested
on
their
heads
but
he
was
puzzled
very
much
by
a
strange
murmuring
noise
which
followed
them
all
the
way
so
much
puzzled
that
at
last
he
took
courage
to
ask
the
keeper
what
it
was
picture
the
keeper
and
grimes
he
spoke
very
civilly
and
called
him
sir
for
he
was
horribly
afraid
of
him
which
pleased
the
keeper
and
he
told
him
that
they
were
the
bees
about
the
lime
flowers
are
bees
asked
tom
make
is
honey
asked
tom
hold
thy
noise
said
grimes
the
boy
be
said
the
keeper
a
civil
young
chap
now
and
more
than
be
long
if
he
bides
with
grimes
laughed
for
he
took
that
for
a
compliment
wish
i
were
a
keeper
said
tom
live
in
such
a
beautiful
place
and
wear
green
velveteens
and
have
a
real
at
my
button
like
the
keeper
laughed
he
was
a
fellow
enough
well
alone
lad
and
ill
too
at
times
thy
safer
than
mine
at
all
events
eh
grimes
and
grimes
laughed
again
and
then
the
two
men
began
talking
quite
low
tom
could
hear
though
that
it
was
about
some
poaching
fight
and
at
last
grimes
said
surlily
thou
anything
against
me
ask
me
any
questions
till
thou
hast
for
i
am
a
man
of
and
at
that
they
both
laughed
again
and
thought
it
a
very
good
joke
and
by
this
time
they
were
come
up
to
the
great
iron
gates
in
front
of
the
house
and
tom
stared
through
them
at
the
rhododendrons
and
azaleas
which
were
all
in
flower
and
then
at
the
house
itself
and
wondered
how
many
chimneys
there
were
in
it
and
how
long
ago
it
was
built
and
what
was
the
name
that
built
it
and
whether
he
got
much
money
for
his
job
these
last
were
very
difficult
questions
to
answer
for
harthover
had
been
built
at
ninety
different
times
and
in
nineteen
different
styles
and
looked
as
if
somebody
had
built
a
whole
street
of
houses
of
every
imaginable
shape
and
then
stirred
them
together
with
a
spoon
the
attics
were
third
door
second
right
wing
pure
centre
early
a
huge
portico
copied
from
the
left
wing
pure
the
country
folk
admired
most
of
it
was
just
like
the
new
barracks
in
the
three
times
as
grand
staircase
was
copied
from
the
catacombs
at
back
staircase
from
the
tajmahal
at
was
built
by
sir
lord
indian
of
of
no
more
taste
than
his
cellars
were
copied
from
the
caves
of
offices
from
the
pavilion
at
and
the
rest
from
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
or
under
the
earth
so
that
harthover
house
was
a
great
puzzle
to
antiquarians
and
a
thorough
vineyard
to
critics
and
architects
and
all
persons
who
like
meddling
with
other
business
and
spending
other
money
so
they
were
all
setting
upon
poor
sir
john
year
after
year
and
trying
to
talk
him
into
spending
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
or
so
in
building
to
please
them
and
not
himself
but
he
always
put
them
off
like
a
canny
as
he
was
one
wanted
him
to
build
a
gothic
house
but
he
said
he
was
no
goth
and
another
to
build
an
elizabethan
but
he
said
he
lived
under
good
queen
victoria
and
not
good
queen
bess
and
another
was
bold
enough
to
tell
him
that
his
house
was
ugly
but
he
said
he
lived
inside
it
and
not
outside
and
another
that
there
was
no
unity
in
it
but
he
said
that
that
was
just
why
he
liked
the
old
place
for
he
liked
to
see
how
each
sir
john
and
sir
hugh
and
sir
ralph
and
sir
randal
had
left
his
mark
upon
the
place
each
after
his
own
taste
and
he
had
no
more
notion
of
disturbing
his
work
than
of
disturbing
their
graves
for
now
the
house
looked
like
a
real
live
house
that
had
a
history
and
had
grown
and
grown
as
the
world
grew
and
that
it
was
only
an
upstart
fellow
who
did
not
know
who
his
own
grandfather
was
who
would
change
it
for
some
spick
and
span
new
gothic
or
elizabethan
thing
which
looked
as
if
it
bad
been
all
spawned
in
a
night
as
mushrooms
are
from
which
you
may
collect
if
you
have
wit
enough
that
sir
john
was
a
very
squire
and
just
the
man
to
keep
the
country
side
in
order
and
show
good
sport
with
his
hounds
picture
the
housekeeper
but
tom
and
his
master
did
not
go
in
through
the
great
iron
gates
as
if
they
had
been
dukes
or
bishops
but
round
the
back
way
and
a
very
long
way
round
it
was
and
into
a
little
where
the
let
them
in
yawning
horribly
and
then
in
a
passage
the
housekeeper
met
them
in
such
a
flowered
chintz
that
tom
mistook
her
for
my
lady
herself
and
she
gave
grimes
solemn
orders
about
will
take
care
of
this
and
take
care
of
that
as
if
he
was
going
up
the
chimneys
and
not
tom
and
grimes
listened
and
said
every
now
and
then
under
his
voice
mind
that
you
little
beggar
and
tom
did
mind
all
at
least
that
he
could
and
then
the
housekeeper
turned
them
into
a
grand
room
all
covered
up
in
sheets
of
brown
paper
and
bade
them
begin
in
a
lofty
and
tremendous
voice
and
so
after
a
whimper
or
two
and
a
kick
from
his
master
into
the
grate
tom
went
and
up
the
chimney
while
a
housemaid
stayed
in
the
room
to
watch
the
furniture
to
whom
grimes
paid
many
playful
and
chivalrous
compliments
but
met
with
very
slight
encouragement
in
return
picture
grimes
paying
complements
how
many
chimneys
tom
swept
i
can
not
say
but
he
swept
so
many
that
he
got
quite
tired
and
puzzled
too
for
they
were
not
like
the
town
flues
to
which
he
was
accustomed
but
such
as
you
would
you
would
only
get
up
them
and
look
which
perhaps
you
would
not
like
to
old
large
and
crooked
chimneys
which
had
been
altered
again
and
again
till
they
ran
one
into
another
anastomosing
as
professor
owen
would
say
considerably
so
tom
fairly
lost
his
way
in
them
not
that
he
cared
much
for
that
though
he
was
in
pitchy
darkness
for
he
was
as
much
at
home
in
a
chimney
as
a
mole
is
underground
but
at
last
coming
down
as
he
thought
the
right
chimney
he
came
down
the
wrong
one
and
found
himself
standing
on
the
hearthrug
in
a
room
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
seen
before
tom
had
never
seen
the
like
he
had
never
been
in
rooms
but
when
the
carpets
were
all
up
and
the
curtains
down
and
the
furniture
huddled
together
under
a
cloth
and
the
pictures
covered
with
aprons
and
dusters
and
he
had
often
enough
wondered
what
the
rooms
were
like
when
they
were
all
ready
for
the
quality
to
sit
in
and
now
he
saw
and
he
thought
the
sight
very
pretty
the
room
was
all
dressed
in
white
white
white
furniture
and
white
walls
with
just
a
few
lines
of
pink
here
and
there
the
carpet
was
all
over
gay
little
flowers
and
the
walls
were
hung
with
pictures
in
gilt
frames
which
amused
tom
very
much
there
were
pictures
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
pictures
of
horses
and
dogs
the
horses
he
liked
but
the
dogs
he
did
not
care
for
much
for
there
were
no
among
them
not
even
a
terrier
but
the
two
pictures
which
took
his
fancy
most
were
one
a
man
in
long
garments
with
little
children
and
their
mothers
round
him
who
was
laying
his
hand
upon
the
heads
that
was
a
very
pretty
picture
tom
thought
to
hang
in
a
room
for
he
could
see
that
it
was
a
room
by
the
dresses
which
lay
about
the
other
picture
was
that
of
a
man
nailed
to
a
cross
which
surprised
tom
much
he
fancied
that
he
had
seen
something
like
it
in
a
but
why
was
it
there
man
thought
tom
he
looks
so
kind
and
quiet
but
why
should
the
lady
have
such
a
sad
picture
as
that
in
her
room
perhaps
it
was
some
kinsman
of
hers
who
had
been
murdered
by
the
savages
in
foreign
parts
and
she
kept
it
there
for
a
and
tom
felt
sad
and
awed
and
turned
to
look
at
something
else
the
next
thing
he
saw
and
that
too
puzzled
him
was
a
with
ewers
and
basins
and
soap
and
brushes
and
towels
and
a
large
bath
full
of
clean
a
heap
of
things
all
for
washing
must
be
a
very
dirty
lady
thought
tom
my
rule
to
want
as
much
scrubbing
as
all
that
but
she
must
be
very
cunning
to
put
the
dirt
out
of
the
way
so
well
afterwards
for
i
see
a
speck
about
the
room
not
even
on
the
very
and
then
looking
toward
the
bed
he
saw
that
dirty
lady
and
held
his
breath
with
astonishment
under
the
coverlet
upon
the
pillow
lay
the
most
beautiful
little
girl
that
tom
had
ever
seen
her
cheeks
were
almost
as
white
as
the
pillow
and
her
hair
was
like
threads
of
gold
spread
all
about
over
the
bed
she
might
have
been
as
old
as
tom
or
maybe
a
year
or
two
older
but
tom
did
not
think
of
that
he
thought
only
of
her
delicate
skin
and
golden
hair
and
wondered
whether
she
was
a
real
live
person
or
one
of
the
wax
dolls
he
had
seen
in
the
shops
but
when
he
saw
her
breathe
he
made
up
his
mind
that
she
was
alive
and
stood
staring
at
her
as
if
she
had
been
an
angel
out
of
heaven
picture
the
girl
asleep
no
she
can
not
be
dirty
she
never
could
have
been
dirty
thought
tom
to
himself
and
then
he
thought
are
all
people
like
that
when
they
are
washed
and
he
looked
at
his
own
wrist
and
tried
to
rub
the
soot
off
and
wondered
whether
it
ever
would
come
off
i
should
look
much
prettier
then
if
i
grew
at
all
like
and
looking
round
he
suddenly
saw
standing
close
to
him
a
little
ugly
black
ragged
figure
with
bleared
eyes
and
grinning
white
teeth
he
turned
on
it
angrily
what
did
such
a
little
black
ape
want
in
that
sweet
young
room
and
behold
it
was
himself
reflected
in
a
great
mirror
the
like
of
which
tom
had
never
seen
before
and
tom
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
found
out
that
he
was
dirty
and
burst
into
tears
with
shame
and
anger
and
turned
to
sneak
up
the
chimney
again
and
hide
and
upset
the
fender
and
threw
the
down
with
a
noise
as
of
ten
thousand
tin
kettles
tied
to
ten
thousand
mad
tails
up
jumped
the
little
white
lady
in
her
bed
and
seeing
tom
screamed
as
shrill
as
any
peacock
in
rushed
a
stout
old
nurse
from
the
next
room
and
seeing
tom
likewise
made
up
her
mind
that
he
had
come
to
rob
plunder
destroy
and
burn
and
dashed
at
him
as
he
lay
over
the
fender
so
fast
that
she
caught
him
by
the
jacket
but
she
did
not
hold
him
tom
had
been
in
a
hands
many
a
time
and
out
of
them
too
what
is
more
and
he
would
have
been
ashamed
to
face
his
friends
for
ever
if
he
had
been
stupid
enough
to
be
caught
by
an
old
woman
so
he
doubled
under
the
good
arm
across
the
room
and
out
of
the
window
in
a
moment
he
did
not
need
to
drop
out
though
he
would
have
done
so
bravely
enough
nor
even
to
let
himself
down
a
spout
which
would
have
been
an
old
game
to
him
for
once
he
got
up
by
a
spout
to
the
church
roof
he
said
to
take
eggs
but
the
policeman
said
to
steal
lead
and
when
he
was
seen
on
high
sat
there
till
the
sun
got
too
hot
and
came
down
by
another
spout
leaving
the
policemen
to
go
back
to
the
stationhouse
and
eat
their
dinners
but
all
under
the
window
spread
a
tree
with
great
leaves
and
sweet
white
flowers
almost
as
big
as
his
head
it
was
magnolia
i
suppose
but
tom
knew
nothing
about
that
and
cared
less
for
down
the
tree
he
went
like
a
cat
and
across
the
garden
lawn
and
over
the
iron
railings
and
up
the
park
towards
the
wood
leaving
the
old
nurse
to
scream
murder
and
fire
at
the
window
picture
the
under
gardener
the
under
gardener
mowing

threw
down
his
scythe
caught
his
leg
in
it
and
cut
his
shin
open
whereby
he
kept
his
bed
for
a
week
but
in
his
hurry
he
never
knew
it
and
gave
chase
to
poor
tom
the
dairymaid
heard
the
noise
got
the
churn
between
her
knees
and
tumbled
over
it
spilling
all
the
cream
and
yet
she
jumped
up
and
gave
chase
to

at

him
go
loose

he
kicked
himself
lame

minutes
but
he
ran
out
and
gave
chase
to

upset
the
in
the
yard
and
spoilt
it
all
utterly
but
he
ran
out
and
gave
chase
to
tom
the
old
steward
opened
the
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
hung
up
his
chin
upon
the
spikes
and
for
aught
i
know
it
hangs
there
still
but
he
jumped
off
and
gave
chase
to
tom
the
ploughman
left
his
horses
at
the
headland
and
one
jumped
over
the
fence
and
pulled
the
other
into

ditch

and
all
but
he
ran
on
and
gave
chase
to

keeper
who
was
taking
a
stoat
out
of
a
trap
let
the
stoat
go
and
caught
his
own
finger
but
he
jumped
up
and
ran
after

considering
what
he
said
and
how
he
looked
i
should
have
been
sorry
for
tom
if
he
had
caught
him
sir
john
looked
out
of
his
study
window
for
he
was
an
early
old
gentleman
and
up
at
the
nurse
and
a
marten
dropped
mud
in
his
eye
so
that
he
had
at
last
to
send
for
the
doctor
and
yet
he
ran
out
and
gave
chase
to

was
walking
up
to
the
house
to
beg

have
got
round
by
some
she
threw
away
her
bundle
and
gave
chase
to
tom
likewise
only
my
lady
did
not
give
chase
for
when
she
had
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
her
fell
into
the
garden
and
she
had
to
ring
up
her
and
send
her
down
for
it
privately
which
quite
put
her
out
of
the
running
so
that
she
came
in
nowhere
and
is
consequently
not
placed

the
old
steward

a
word
never
was
there
heard
at

when
the
fox
was
killed
in
the
conservatory
among
acres
of
broken
glass
and
tons
of
smashed
a
noise
row
hubbub
babel
shindy
hullabaloo
stramash
charivari
and
total
contempt
of
dignity
repose
and
order
as
that
day
when
grimes

the
groom
the
dairymaid
sir
john
the
steward
the
ploughman
the
keeper
and
the
irishwoman
all
ran
up
the
park
shouting
thief
in
the
belief
that
tom
had
at
least
a
thousand
worth
of
jewels
in
his
empty
pockets
and
the
very
magpies
and
jays
followed
tom
up
screaking
and
screaming
as
if
he
were
a
hunted
fox
beginning
to
droop
his
brush
picture
grimes
and
all
the
while
poor
tom
paddled
up
the
park
with
his
little
bare
feet
like
a
small
black
gorilla
fleeing
to
the
forest
alas
for
him
there
was
no
big
father
gorilla
therein
to
take
his
scratch
out
the
inside
with
one
paw
toss
the
dairymaid
into
a
tree
with
another
and
wrench
off
sir
head
with
a
third
while
he
cracked
the
skull
with
his
teeth
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
a
or
a
picture
man
on
horse
however
tom
did
not
remember
ever
having
had
a
father
so
he
did
not
look
for
one
and
expected
to
have
to
take
care
of
himself
while
as
for
running
he
could
keep
up
for
a
couple
of
miles
with
any
if
there
was
the
chance
of
a
copper
or
a
and
turn
on
his
hands
and
feet
ten
times
following
which
is
more
than
you
can
do
wherefore
his
pursuers
found
it
very
difficult
to
catch
him
and
we
will
hope
that
they
did
not
catch
him
at
all
picture
man
chasing
tom
of
course
made
for
the
woods
he
had
never
been
in
a
wood
in
his
life
but
he
was
sharp
enough
to
know
that
he
might
hide
in
a
bush
or
swarm
up
a
tree
and
altogether
had
more
chance
there
than
in
the
open
if
he
had
not
known
that
he
would
have
been
foolisher
than
a
mouse
or
a
minnow
picture
man
on
knees
but
when
he
got
into
the
wood
he
found
it
a
very
different
sort
of
place
from
what
he
had
fancied
he
pushed
into
a
thick
cover
of
rhododendrons
and
found
himself
at
once
caught
in
a
trap
the
boughs
laid
hold
of
his
legs
and
arms
poked
him
in
his
face
and
his
stomach
made
him
shut
his
eyes
tight
though
that
was
no
great
loss
for
he
could
not
see
at
best
a
yard
before
his
nose
and
when
he
got
through
the
rhododendrons
the
and
sedges
tumbled
him
over
and
cut
his
poor
little
fingers
afterwards
most
spitefully
the
birches
birched
him
as
soundly
as
if
he
had
been
a
nobleman
at
eton
and
over
the
face
too
which
is
not
fair
swishing
as
all
brave
boys
will
agree
and
the
lawyers
tripped
him
up
and
tore
his
shins
as
if
they
had
lawyers
are
likely
enough
to
have
must
get
out
of
this
thought
tom
i
shall
stay
here
till
somebody
comes
to
help
is
just
what
i
but
how
to
get
out
was
the
difficult
matter
and
indeed
i
think
he
would
ever
have
got
out
at
all
but
have
stayed
there
till
the
covered
him
with
leaves
if
he
had
not
suddenly
run
his
head
against
a
wall
picture
man
looking
out
of
window
now
running
your
head
against
a
wall
is
not
pleasant
especially
if
it
is
a
loose
wall
with
the
stones
all
set
on
edge
and
a
sharp
cornered
one
hits
you
between
the
eyes
and
makes
you
see
all
manner
of
beautiful
stars
the
stars
are
very
beautiful
certainly
but
unfortunately
they
go
in
the
part
of
a
split
second
and
the
pain
which
comes
after
them
does
not
and
so
tom
hurt
his
head
but
he
was
a
brave
boy
and
did
not
mind
that
a
penny
he
guessed
that
over
the
wall
the
cover
would
end
and
up
it
he
went
and
over
like
a
squirrel
and
there
he
was
out
on
the
great
which
the
country
folk
called
harthover
and
bog
and
rock
stretching
away
and
up
up
to
the
very
sky
now
tom
was
a
cunning
little
cunning
as
an
old
exmoor
stag
why
not
though
he
was
but
ten
years
old
he
had
lived
longer
than
most
stags
and
had
more
wits
to
start
with
into
the
bargain
he
knew
as
well
as
a
stag
that
if
he
backed
he
might
throw
the
hounds
out
so
the
first
thing
he
did
when
he
was
over
the
wall
was
to
make
the
neatest
double
sharp
to
his
right
and
run
along
under
the
wall
for
nearly
half
a
mile
whereby
sir
john
and
the
keeper
and
the
steward
and
the
gardener
and
the
ploughman
and
the
dairymaid
and
all
the
together
went
on
ahead
half
a
mile
in
the
very
opposite
direction
and
inside
the
wall
leaving
him
a
mile
off
on
the
outside
while
tom
heard
their
shouts
die
away
in
the
woods
and
chuckled
to
himself
merrily
at
last
he
came
to
a
dip
in
the
land
and
went
to
the
bottom
of
it
and
then
he
turned
bravely
away
from
the
wall
and
up
the
moor
for
he
knew
that
he
had
put
a
hill
between
him
and
his
enemies
and
could
go
on
without
their
seeing
him
but
the
irishwoman
alone
of
them
all
had
seen
which
way
tom
went
she
had
kept
ahead
of
every
one
the
whole
time
and
yet
she
neither
walked
nor
ran
she
went
along
quite
smoothly
and
gracefully
while
her
feet
twinkled
past
each
other
so
fast
that
you
could
not
see
which
was
foremost
till
every
one
asked
the
other
who
the
strange
woman
was
and
all
agreed
for
want
of
anything
better
to
say
that
she
must
be
in
league
with
tom
but
when
she
came
to
the
plantation
they
lost
sight
of
her
and
they
could
do
no
less
for
she
went
quietly
over
the
wall
after
tom
and
followed
him
wherever
he
went
sir
john
and
the
rest
saw
no
more
of
her
and
out
of
sight
was
out
of
mind
and
now
tom
was
right
away
into
the
heather
over
just
such
a
moor
as
those
in
which
you
have
been
bred
except
that
there
were
rocks
and
stones
lying
about
everywhere
and
that
instead
of
the
moor
growing
flat
as
he
went
upwards
it
grew
more
and
more
broken
and
hilly
but
not
so
rough
but
that
little
tom
could
jog
along
well
enough
and
find
time
too
to
stare
about
at
the
strange
place
which
was
like
a
new
world
to
him
he
saw
great
spiders
there
with
crowns
and
crosses
marked
on
their
backs
who
sat
in
the
middle
of
their
webs
and
when
they
saw
tom
coming
shook
them
so
fast
that
they
became
invisible
then
he
saw
lizards
brown
and
gray
and
green
and
thought
they
were
snakes
and
would
sting
him
but
they
were
as
much
frightened
as
he
and
shot
away
into
the
heath
and
then
under
a
rock
he
saw
a
pretty
great
brown
creature
with
a
white
tag
to
her
brush
and
round
her
four
or
five
smutty
little
cubs
the
funniest
fellows
tom
ever
saw
she
lay
on
her
back
rolling
about
and
stretching
out
her
legs
and
head
and
tail
in
the
bright
sunshine
and
the
cubs
jumped
over
her
and
ran
round
her
and
nibbled
her
paws
and
lugged
her
about
by
the
tail
and
she
seemed
to
enjoy
it
mightily
but
one
selfish
little
fellow
stole
away
from
the
rest
to
a
dead
crow
close
by
and
dragged
it
off
to
hide
it
though
it
was
nearly
as
big
as
he
was
whereat
all
his
little
brothers
set
off
after
him
in
full
cry
and
saw
tom
and
then
all
ran
back
and
up
jumped
vixen
and
caught
one
up
in
her
mouth
and
the
rest
toddled
after
her
and
into
a
dark
crack
in
the
rocks
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
show
picture
fox
with
cubs
and
next
he
had
a
fright
for
as
he
scrambled
up
a
sandy
went
off
in
his
face
with
a
most
horrid
noise
he
thought
the
ground
had
blown
up
and
the
end
of
the
world
come
and
when
he
opened
his
eyes
for
he
shut
them
very
tight
it
was
only
an
old
who
had
been
washing
himself
in
sand
like
an
arab
for
want
of
water
and
who
when
tom
had
all
but
trodden
on
him
jumped
up
with
a
noise
like
the
express
train
leaving
his
wife
and
children
to
shift
for
themselves
like
an
old
coward
and
went
off
screaming
thieves
end
of
the
world
is
he
was
always
fancying
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
come
when
anything
happened
which
was
farther
off
than
the
end
of
his
own
nose
but
the
end
of
the
world
was
not
come
any
more
than
the
twelfth
of
august
was
though
the
old
was
quite
certain
of
it
picture
the
grouse
so
the
old
grouse
came
back
to
his
wife
and
family
an
hour
afterwards
and
said
solemnly
my
dears
the
end
of
the
world
is
not
quite
come
but
i
assure
you
it
is
coming
the
day
after
but
his
wife
had
heard
that
so
often
that
she
knew
all
about
it
and
a
little
more
and
besides
she
was
the
mother
of
a
family
and
had
seven
little
poults
to
wash
and
feed
every
day
and
that
made
her
very
practical
and
a
little
so
all
she
answered
was
and
catch
spiders
go
and
catch
so
tom
went
on
and
on
he
hardly
knew
why
but
he
liked
the
great
wide
strange
place
and
the
cool
fresh
bracing
air
but
he
went
more
and
more
slowly
as
he
got
higher
up
the
hill
for
now
the
ground
grew
very
bad
indeed
instead
of
soft
turf
and
springy
heather
he
met
great
patches
of
flat
limestone
rock
just
like
pavements
with
deep
cracks
between
the
stones
and
ledges
filled
with
ferns
so
he
had
to
hop
from
stone
to
stone
and
now
and
then
he
slipped
in
between
and
hurt
his
little
bare
toes
though
they
were
tolerably
tough
ones
but
still
he
would
go
on
and
up
he
could
not
tell
why
what
would
tom
have
said
if
he
had
seen
walking
over
the
moor
behind
him
the
very
same
irishwoman
who
had
taken
his
part
upon
the
road
but
whether
it
was
that
he
looked
too
little
behind
him
or
whether
it
was
that
she
kept
out
of
sight
behind
the
rocks
and
knolls
he
never
saw
her
though
she
saw
him
and
now
he
began
to
get
a
little
hungry
and
very
thirsty
for
he
had
run
a
long
way
and
the
sun
had
risen
high
in
heaven
and
the
rock
was
as
hot
as
an
oven
and
the
air
danced
reels
over
it
as
it
does
over
a
limekiln
till
everything
round
seemed
quivering
and
melting
in
the
glare
but
he
could
see
nothing
to
eat
anywhere
and
still
less
to
drink
the
heath
was
full
of
bilberries
and
whimberries
but
they
were
only
in
flower
yet
for
it
was
june
and
as
for
water
who
can
find
that
on
the
top
of
a
limestone
rock
now
and
then
he
passed
by
a
deep
dark
going
down
into
the
earth
as
if
it
was
the
chimney
of
some
dwarfs
house
underground
and
more
than
once
as
he
passed
he
could
hear
water
falling
trickling
tinkling
many
many
feet
below
how
he
longed
to
get
down
to
it
and
cool
his
poor
baked
lips
but
brave
little
as
he
was
he
dared
not
climb
down
such
chimneys
as
those
so
he
went
on
and
on
till
his
head
spun
round
with
the
heat
and
he
thought
he
heard
ringing
a
long
way
off
he
thought
there
is
a
church
there
will
be
houses
and
people
and
perhaps
some
one
will
give
me
a
bit
and
a
so
he
set
off
again
to
look
for
the
church
for
he
was
sure
that
he
heard
the
bells
quite
plain
and
in
a
minute
more
when
he
looked
round
he
stopped
again
and
said
what
a
big
place
the
world
is
and
so
it
was
for
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
he
could
could
he
not
see
behind
him
far
below
was
harthover
and
the
dark
woods
and
the
shining
salmon
river
and
on
his
left
far
below
was
the
town
and
the
smoking
chimneys
of
the
collieries
and
far
far
away
the
river
widened
to
the
shining
sea
and
little
white
specks
which
were
ships
lay
on
its
bosom
before
him
lay
spread
out
like
a
map
great
plains
and
farms
and
villages
amid
dark
knots
of
trees
they
all
seemed
at
his
very
feet
but
he
had
sense
to
see
that
they
were
long
miles
away
and
to
his
right
rose
moor
after
moor
hill
after
hill
till
they
faded
away
blue
into
blue
sky
but
between
him
and
those
moors
and
really
at
his
very
feet
lay
something
to
which
as
soon
as
tom
saw
it
he
determined
to
go
for
that
was
the
place
for
him
a
deep
deep
green
and
rocky
valley
very
narrow
and
filled
with
wood
but
through
the
wood
hundreds
of
feet
below
him
he
could
see
a
clear
stream
glance
oh
if
he
could
but
get
down
to
that
stream
then
by
the
stream
he
saw
the
roof
of
a
little
cottage
and
a
little
garden
set
out
in
squares
and
beds
and
there
was
a
tiny
little
red
thing
moving
in
the
garden
no
bigger
than
a
fly
as
tom
looked
down
he
saw
that
it
was
a
woman
in
a
red
petticoat
ah
perhaps
she
would
give
him
something
to
eat
and
there
were
the
ringing
again
surely
there
must
be
a
village
down
there
well
nobody
would
know
him
or
what
had
happened
at
the
place
the
news
could
not
have
got
there
yet
even
if
sir
john
had
set
all
the
policemen
in
the
county
after
him
and
he
could
get
down
there
in
five
minutes
tom
was
quite
right
about
the
not
having
got
thither
for
he
had
come
without
knowing
it
the
best
part
of
ten
miles
from
harthover
but
he
was
wrong
about
getting
down
in
five
minutes
for
the
cottage
was
more
than
a
mile
off
and
a
good
thousand
feet
below
picture
youth
reclining
near
stream
however
down
he
went
like
a
brave
little
man
as
he
was
though
he
was
very
footsore
and
tired
and
hungry
and
thirsty
while
the
rang
so
loud
he
began
to
think
that
they
must
be
inside
his
own
head
and
the
river
chimed
and
tinkled
far
below
and
this
was
the
song
which
it
sang
and
and
laughing
dreaming
and
and
shining
foaming
the
crag
where
the
ouzel
the
ivied
wall
where
the
the
by
in
and
and
and
the
smoky
town
in
its
murky
and
and
wharf
and
sewer
and
slimy
and
darker
the
farther
i
and
baser
the
richer
i
dares
sport
with
the
from
from
and
and
and
floodgates
are
to
the

and
my
streams
as
i
hurry
the
golden
the
leaping
the
taintless
tide
that
awaits
me
i
lose
myself
in
the
infinite
a
soul
that
has
sinned
and
is
pardoned
the

and
so
tom
went
down
and
all
the
while
he
never
saw

irishwoman
going
down
behind
him

and

spenser
picture
tom
at
the
old
house
a
mile
off
and
a
thousand
feet
down
so
tom
found
it
though
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
have
chucked
a
pebble
on
to
the
back
of
the
woman
in
the
red
petticoat
who
was
weeding
in
the
garden
or
even
across
the
dale
to
the
rocks
beyond
for
the
bottom
of
the
valley
was
just
one
field
broad
and
on
the
other
side
ran
the
stream
and
above
it
gray
crag
gray
down
gray
stair
gray
moor
walled
up
to
heaven
a
quiet
silent
rich
happy
place
a
narrow
crack
cut
deep
into
the
earth
so
deep
and
so
out
of
the
way
that
the
bad
bogies
can
hardly
find
it
out
the
name
of
the
place
is
vendale
and
if
you
want
to
see
it
for
yourself
you
must
go
up
into
the
high
craven
and
search
from
bolland
forest
north
by
ingleborough
to
the
nine
standards
and
cross
fell
and
if
you
have
not
found
it
you
must
turn
south
and
search
the
lake
mountains
down
to
scaw
fell
and
the
sea
and
then
if
you
have
not
found
it
you
must
go
northward
again
by
merry
carlisle
and
search
the
cheviots
all
across
from
annan
water
to
berwick
law
and
then
whether
you
have
found
vendale
or
not
you
will
have
found
such
a
country
and
such
a
people
as
ought
to
make
you
proud
of
being
a
british
boy
so
tom
went
to
go
down
and
first
he
went
down
three
hundred
feet
of
steep
heather
mixed
up
with
loose
brown
grindstone
as
rough
as
a
file
which
was
not
pleasant
to
his
poor
little
heels
as
he
came
bump
stump
jump
down
the
steep
and
still
he
thought
he
could
throw
a
stone
into
the
garden
then
he
went
down
three
hundred
feet
of
terraces
one
below
the
other
as
straight
as
if
a
carpenter
had
ruled
them
with
his
ruler
and
then
cut
them
out
with
his
chisel
there
was
no
heath
there
first
a
little
grass
slope
covered
with
the
prettiest
flowers
rockrose
and
saxifrage
and
thyme
and
basil
and
all
sorts
of
sweet
herbs
then
bump
down
a
step
of
limestone
then
another
bit
of
grass
and
flowers
then
bump
down
a
step
then
another
bit
of
grass
and
flowers
for
fifty
yards
as
steep
as
the
where
he
had
to
slide
down
on
his
dear
little
tail
then
another
step
of
stone
ten
feet
high
and
there
he
had
to
stop
himself
and
crawl
along
the
edge
to
find
a
crack
for
if
he
had
rolled
over
he
would
have
rolled
right
into
the
old
garden
and
frightened
her
out
of
her
wits
then
when
he
had
found
a
dark
narrow
crack
full
of
fern
such
as
hangs
in
the
basket
in
the
and
had
crawled
down
through
it
with
knees
and
elbows
as
he
would
down
a
chimney
there
was
another
grass
slope
and
another
step
and
so
on
dear
me
i
wish
it
was
all
over
and
so
did
he
and
yet
he
thought
he
could
throw
a
stone
into
the
old
garden
at
last
he
came
to
a
bank
of
beautiful
shrubs
with
its
great
leaves
and
and
oak
and
below
them
cliff
and
crag
cliff
and
crag
with
great
beds
of
and
while
through
the
shrubs
he
could
see
the
stream
sparkling
and
hear
it
murmur
on
the
white
pebbles
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
three
hundred
feet
below
you
would
have
been
giddy
perhaps
at
looking
down
but
tom
was
not
he
was
a
brave
little
and
when
he
found
himself
on
the
top
of
a
high
cliff
instead
of
sitting
down
and
crying
for
his
baba
though
he
never
had
had
any
baba
to
cry
for
he
said
this
will
just
suit
me
though
he
was
very
tired
and
down
he
went
by
stock
and
stone
sedge
and
ledge
bush
and
rush
as
if
he
had
been
born
a
jolly
little
black
ape
with
four
hands
instead
of
two
and
all
the
while
he
never
saw
the
irishwoman
coming
down
behind
him
but
he
was
getting
terribly
tired
now
the
burning
sun
on
the
fells
had
sucked
him
up
but
the
damp
heat
of
the
woody
crag
sucked
him
up
still
more
and
the
perspiration
ran
out
of
the
ends
of
his
fingers
and
toes
and
washed
him
cleaner
than
he
had
been
for
a
whole
year
but
of
course
he
dirtied
everything
terribly
as
he
went
there
has
been
a
great
black
smudge
all
down
the
crag
ever
since
and
there
have
been
more
black
beetles
in
vendale
since
than
ever
were
known
before
all
of
course
owing
to
having
blacked
the
original
papa
of
them
all
just
as
he
was
setting
off
to
be
married
with
a
coat
and
scarlet
leggins
as
smart
as
a
dog
with
a
polyanthus
in
his
mouth
at
last
he
got
to
the
bottom
but
behold
it
was
not
the
people
usually
find
when
they
are
coming
down
a
mountain
for
at
the
foot
of
the
crag
were
heaps
and
heaps
of
fallen
limestone
of
every
size
from
that
of
your
head
to
that
of
a
with
holes
between
them
full
of
sweet
and
before
tom
got
through
them
he
was
out
in
the
bright
sunshine
again
and
then
he
felt
once
for
all
and
suddenly
as
people
generally
do
that
he
was
beat
you
must
expect
to
be
beat
a
few
times
in
your
life
little
man
if
you
live
such
a
life
as
a
man
ought
to
live
let
you
be
as
strong
and
healthy
as
you
may
and
when
you
are
you
will
find
it
a
very
ugly
feeling
i
hope
that
that
day
you
may
have
a
stout
staunch
friend
by
you
who
is
not
beat
for
if
you
have
not
you
had
best
lie
where
you
are
and
wait
for
better
times
as
poor
tom
did
he
could
not
get
on
the
sun
was
burning
and
yet
he
felt
chill
all
over
he
was
quite
empty
and
yet
he
felt
quite
sick
there
was
but
two
hundred
yards
of
smooth
pasture
between
him
and
the
cottage
and
yet
he
could
not
walk
down
it
he
could
hear
the
stream
murmuring
only
one
field
beyond
it
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
was
a
hundred
miles
off
he
lay
down
on
the
grass
till
the
beetles
ran
over
him
and
the
flies
settled
on
his
nose
i
know
when
he
would
have
got
up
again
if
the
gnats
and
the
midges
had
not
taken
compassion
on
him
but
the
gnats
blew
their
trumpets
so
loud
in
his
ear
and
the
midges
nibbled
so
at
his
hands
and
face
wherever
they
could
find
a
place
free
from
soot
that
at
last
he
woke
up
and
stumbled
away
down
over
a
low
wall
and
into
a
narrow
road
and
up
to
the
and
a
neat
pretty
cottage
it
was
with
clipped
yew
hedges
all
round
the
garden
and
yews
inside
too
cut
into
peacocks
and
trumpets
and
teapots
and
all
kinds
of
queer
shapes
and
out
of
the
open
door
came
a
noise
like
that
of
the
frogs
on
the
when
they
know
that
it
is
going
to
be
scorching
hot
how
they
know
that
i
know
and
you
know
and
nobody
knows
he
came
slowly
up
to
the
open
door
which
was
all
hung
round
with
clematis
and
roses
and
then
peeped
in
half
afraid
and
there
sat
by
the
empty
fireplace
which
was
filled
with
a
pot
of
sweet
herbs
the
nicest
old
woman
that
ever
was
seen
in
her
red
petticoat
and
short
dimity
bedgown
and
clean
white
cap
with
a
black
silk
handkerchief
over
it
tied
under
her
chin
at
her
feet
sat
the
grandfather
of
all
the
cats
and
opposite
her
sat
on
two
benches
twelve
or
fourteen
neat
rosy
chubby
little
children
learning
their
and
gabble
enough
they
made
about
it
such
a
pleasant
cottage
it
was
with
a
shiny
clean
stone
floor
and
curious
old
prints
on
the
walls
and
an
old
black
oak
sideboard
full
of
bright
pewter
and
brass
dishes
and
a
cuckoo
clock
in
the
corner
which
began
shouting
as
soon
as
tom
appeared
not
that
it
was
frightened
at
tom
but
that
it
was
just
eleven
all
the
children
started
at
dirty
black
figure
girls
began
to
cry
and
the
boys
began
to
laugh
and
all
pointed
at
him
rudely
enough
but
tom
was
too
tired
to
care
for
that
art
thou
and
what
dost
want
cried
the
old
dame
away
with
thee
have
no
sweeps
said
poor
little
tom
quite
faint
plenty
the
beck
she
said
quite
sharply
i
get
there
most
clemmed
with
hunger
and
and
tom
sank
down
upon
the
and
laid
his
head
against
the
post
and
the
old
dame
looked
at
him
through
her
spectacles
one
minute
and
two
and
three
and
then
she
said
sick
and
a
a
bairn
sweep
or
said
tom
forgive
me
and
she
put
by
her
spectacles
and
rose
and
came
to
tom
bad
for
thee
give
thee
and
she
toddled
off
into
the
next
room
and
brought
a
cup
of
milk
and
a
bit
of
bread
tom
drank
the
milk
off
at
one
draught
and
then
looked
up
revived
didst
come
from
said
the
dame
fell
there
said
tom
and
pointed
up
into
the
sky
harthover
and
down
lewthwaite
crag
art
sure
thou
art
not
lying
should
i
said
tom
and
leant
his
head
against
the
post
how
got
ye
up
there
came
over
from
the
place
and
tom
was
so
tired
and
desperate
he
had
no
heart
or
time
to
think
of
a
story
so
he
told
all
the
truth
in
a
few
words
thy
little
heart
and
thou
hast
not
been
stealing
then
thy
little
heart
and
warrant
not
why
guided
the
bairn
because
he
was
innocent
away
from
the
place
and
over
harthover
fell
and
down
lewthwaite
crag
who
ever
heard
the
like
if
god
led
him
why
dost
not
eat
thy
bread
good
enough
for
i
made
it
said
tom
and
he
laid
his
head
on
his
knees
and
then
it
sunday
then
why
should
it
be
i
hear
the
ringing
thy
pretty
heart
the
sick
come
me
and
hap
thee
up
somewhere
if
thou
wert
a
bit
cleaner
put
thee
in
my
own
bed
for
the
sake
but
come
along
but
when
tom
tried
to
get
up
he
was
so
tired
and
giddy
that
she
had
to
help
him
and
lead
him
she
put
him
in
an
outhouse
upon
soft
sweet
hay
and
an
old
rug
and
bade
him
sleep
off
his
walk
and
she
would
come
to
him
when
school
was
over
in
an
time
and
so
she
went
in
again
expecting
tom
to
fall
fast
asleep
at
once
but
tom
did
not
fall
asleep
instead
of
it
he
turned
and
tossed
and
kicked
about
in
the
strangest
way
and
felt
so
hot
all
over
that
he
longed
to
get
into
the
river
and
cool
himself
and
then
he
fell
half
asleep
and
dreamt
that
he
heard
the
little
white
lady
crying
to
him
so
dirty
go
and
be
washed
and
then
that
he
heard
the
irishwoman
saying
that
wish
to
be
clean
clean
they
will
and
then
he
heard
the
ring
so
loud
close
to
him
too
that
he
was
sure
it
must
be
sunday
in
spite
of
what
the
old
dame
had
said
and
he
would
go
to
church
and
see
what
a
church
was
like
inside
for
he
had
never
been
in
one
poor
little
fellow
in
all
his
life
but
the
people
would
never
let
him
come
in
all
over
soot
and
dirt
like
that
he
must
go
to
the
river
and
wash
first
and
he
said
out
loud
again
and
again
though
being
half
asleep
he
did
not
know
it
must
be
clean
i
must
be
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
found
himself
not
in
the
outhouse
on
the
hay
but
in
the
middle
of
a
meadow
over
the
road
with
the
stream
just
before
him
saying
continually
must
be
clean
i
must
be
he
had
got
there
on
his
own
legs
between
sleep
and
awake
as
children
will
often
get
out
of
bed
and
go
about
the
room
when
they
are
not
quite
well
but
he
was
not
a
bit
surprised
and
went
on
to
the
bank
of
the
brook
and
lay
down
on
the
grass
and
looked
into
the
clear
clear
limestone
water
with
every
pebble
at
the
bottom
bright
and
clean
while
the
little
silver
trout
dashed
about
in
fright
at
the
sight
of
his
black
face
and
he
dipped
his
hand
in
and
found
it
so
cool
cool
cool
and
he
said
will
be
a
fish
i
will
swim
in
the
water
i
must
be
clean
i
must
be
so
he
pulled
off
all
his
clothes
in
such
haste
that
he
tore
some
of
them
which
was
easy
enough
with
such
ragged
old
things
and
he
put
his
poor
hot
sore
feet
into
the
water
and
then
his
legs
and
the
farther
he
went
in
the
more
the
rang
in
his
head
said
tom
must
be
quick
and
wash
myself
the
bells
are
ringing
quite
loud
now
and
they
will
stop
soon
and
then
the
door
will
be
shut
and
i
shall
never
be
able
to
get
in
at
tom
was
mistaken
for
in
england
the
church
doors
are
left
open
all
service
time
for
everybody
who
likes
to
come
in
churchman
or
dissenter
ay
even
if
he
were
a
turk
or
a
heathen
and
if
any
man
dared
to
turn
him
out
as
long
as
he
behaved
quietly
the
good
old
english
law
would
punish
that
man
as
he
deserved
for
ordering
any
peaceable
person
out
of
house
which
belongs
to
all
alike
but
tom
did
not
know
that
any
more
than
he
knew
a
great
deal
more
which
people
ought
to
know
and
all
the
while
he
never
saw
the
irishwoman
not
behind
him
this
time
but
before
picture
the
queen
of
them
all
for
just
before
he
came
to
the
river
side
she
had
stept
down
into
the
cool
clear
water
and
her
shawl
and
her
petticoat
floated
off
her
and
the
green
floated
round
her
sides
and
the
white
floated
round
her
head
and
the
fairies
of
the
stream
came
up
from
the
bottom
and
bore
her
away
and
down
upon
their
arms
for
she
was
the
queen
of
them
all
and
perhaps
of
more
besides
have
you
been
they
asked
her
have
been
smoothing
sick
pillows
and
whispering
sweet
dreams
into
their
ears
opening
cottage
casements
to
let
out
the
stifling
air
coaxing
little
children
away
from
gutters
and
foul
pools
where
fever
breeds
turning
women
from
the
door
and
staying
hands
as
they
were
going
to
strike
their
wives
doing
all
i
can
to
help
those
who
will
not
help
themselves
and
little
enough
that
is
and
weary
work
for
me
but
i
have
brought
you
a
new
little
brother
and
watched
him
safe
all
the
way
then
all
the
fairies
laughed
for
joy
at
the
thought
that
they
had
a
little
brother
coming
mind
maidens
he
must
not
see
you
or
know
that
you
are
here
he
is
but
a
savage
now
and
like
the
beasts
which
perish
and
from
the
beasts
which
perish
he
must
learn
so
you
must
not
play
with
him
or
speak
to
him
or
let
him
see
you
but
only
keep
him
from
being
then
the
fairies
were
sad
because
they
could
not
play
with
their
new
brother
but
they
always
did
what
they
were
told
and
their
queen
floated
away
down
the
river
and
whither
she
went
thither
she
came
but
all
this
tom
of
course
never
saw
or
heard
and
perhaps
if
he
had
it
would
have
made
little
difference
in
the
story
for
was
so
hot
and
thirsty
and
longed
so
to
be
clean
for
once
that
he
tumbled
himself
as
quick
as
he
could
into
the
clear
cool
stream
and
he
had
not
been
in
it
two
minutes
before
he
fell
fast
asleep
into
the
quietest
sunniest
cosiest
sleep
that
ever
he
had
in
his
life
and
he
dreamt
about
the
green
meadows
by
which
he
had
walked
that
morning
and
the
tall
and
the
sleeping
cows
and
after
that
he
dreamt
of
nothing
at
all
the
reason
of
his
falling
into
such
a
delightful
sleep
is
very
simple
and
yet
hardly
any
one
has
found
it
out
it
was
merely
that
the
fairies
took
him
some
people
think
that
there
are
no
fairies
cousin
cramchild
tells
little
folks
so
in
his
conversations
well
perhaps
there
are
boston
where
he
was
raised
there
are
only
a
clumsy
lot
of
spirits
there
who
make
people
hear
without
thumping
on
the
table
but
they
get
their
living
thereby
and
i
suppose
that
is
all
they
want
and
aunt
agitate
in
her
arguments
on
political
economy
says
there
are
none
well
perhaps
there
are
her
political
economy
but
it
is
a
wide
world
my
little
thank
heaven
for
it
for
else
between
crinolines
and
theories
some
of
us
would
get
plenty
of
room
in
it
for
fairies
without
people
seeing
them
unless
of
course
they
look
in
the
right
place
the
most
wonderful
and
the
strongest
things
in
the
world
you
know
are
just
the
things
which
no
one
can
see
there
is
life
in
you
and
it
is
the
life
in
you
which
makes
you
grow
and
move
and
think
and
yet
you
see
it
and
there
is
steam
in
a
and
that
is
what
makes
it
move
and
yet
you
see
it
and
so
there
may
be
fairies
in
the
world
and
they
may
be
just
what
makes
the
world
go
round
to
the
old
tune
of
fait
la
monde
à
la
picture
fairy
cherub
with
arrow
and
yet
no
one
may
be
able
to
see
them
except
those
whose
hearts
are
going
round
to
that
same
tune
at
all
events
we
will
make
believe
that
there
are
fairies
in
the
world
it
will
not
be
the
last
time
by
many
a
one
that
we
shall
have
to
make
believe
and
yet
after
all
there
is
no
need
for
that
there
must
be
fairies
for
this
is
a
fairy
tale
and
how
can
one
have
a
fairy
tale
if
there
are
no
fairies
you
see
the
logic
of
that
perhaps
not
then
please
not
to
see
the
logic
of
a
great
many
arguments
exactly
like
it
which
you
will
hear
before
your
beard
is
gray
the
kind
old
dame
came
back
at
twelve
when
school
was
over
to
look
at
tom
but
there
was
no
tom
there
she
looked
about
for
his
footprints
but
the
ground
was
so
hard
that
there
was
no
slot
as
they
say
in
dear
old
north
devon
and
if
you
grow
up
to
be
a
brave
healthy
man
you
may
know
some
day
what
no
slot
means
and
know
too
i
hope
what
a
slot
does
broad
slot
with
blunt
claws
which
makes
a
man
put
out
his
cigar
and
set
his
teeth
and
tighten
his
girths
when
he
sees
it
and
what
his
rights
mean
if
he
has
them
brow
bay
tray
and
points
and
see
something
worth
seeing
between
haddon
wood
and
countisbury
cliff
with
good
palk
collyns
to
show
you
the
way
and
mend
your
bones
as
fast
as
you
smash
them
only
when
that
jolly
day
comes
please
break
your
neck
stogged
in
a
mire
you
never
will
be
i
trust
for
you
are
a
bred
and
born
so
the
old
dame
went
in
again
quite
sulky
thinking
that
little
tom
had
tricked
her
with
a
false
story
and
shammed
ill
and
then
run
away
again
but
she
altered
her
mind
the
next
day
for
when
sir
john
and
the
rest
of
them
had
run
themselves
out
of
breath
and
lost
tom
they
went
back
again
looking
very
foolish
and
they
looked
more
foolish
still
when
sir
john
heard
more
of
the
story
from
the
nurse
and
more
foolish
still
again
when
they
heard
the
whole
story
from
miss
ellie
the
little
lady
in
white
all
she
had
seen
was
a
poor
little
black
crying
and
sobbing
and
going
to
get
up
the
chimney
again
of
course
she
was
very
much
frightened
and
no
wonder
but
that
was
all
the
boy
had
taken
nothing
in
the
room
by
the
mark
of
his
little
sooty
feet
they
could
see
that
he
had
never
been
off
the
hearthrug
till
the
nurse
caught
hold
of
him
it
was
all
a
mistake
so
sir
john
told
grimes
to
go
home
and
promised
him
five
shillings
if
he
would
bring
the
boy
quietly
up
to
him
without
beating
him
that
he
might
be
sure
of
the
truth
for
he
took
for
granted
and
grimes
too
that
tom
had
made
his
way
home
but
no
tom
came
back
to
grimes
that
evening
and
he
went
to
the
to
tell
them
to
look
out
for
the
boy
but
no
tom
was
heard
of
as
for
his
having
gone
over
those
great
fells
to
vendale
they
no
more
dreamed
of
that
than
of
his
having
gone
to
the
moon
so
grimes
came
up
to
harthover
next
day
with
a
very
sour
face
but
when
he
got
there
sir
john
was
over
the
hills
and
far
away
and
grimes
had
to
sit
in
the
outer
hall
all
day
and
drink
strong
ale
to
wash
away
his
sorrows
and
they
were
washed
away
long
before
sir
john
came
back
for
good
sir
john
had
slept
very
badly
that
night
and
he
said
to
his
lady
dear
the
boy
must
have
got
over
into
the
and
lost
himself
and
he
lies
very
heavily
on
my
conscience
poor
little
lad
but
i
know
what
i
will
picture
sir
john
so
at
five
the
next
morning
up
he
got
and
into
his
bath
and
into
his
and
gaiters
and
into
the
stableyard
like
a
fine
old
english
gentleman
with
a
face
as
red
as
a
rose
and
a
hand
as
hard
as
a
table
and
a
back
as
broad
as
a
and
bade
them
bring
his
shooting
pony
and
the
keeper
to
come
on
his
pony
and
the
huntsman
and
the
first
whip
and
the
second
whip
and
the
with
the
bloodhound
in
a
great
dog
as
tall
as
a
calf
of
the
colour
of
a
with
mahogany
ears
and
nose
and
a
throat
like
a
they
took
him
up
to
the
place
where
tom
had
gone
into
the
wood
and
there
the
hound
lifted
up
his
mighty
voice
and
told
them
all
he
knew
then
he
took
them
to
the
place
where
tom
had
climbed
the
wall
and
they
shoved
it
down
and
all
got
through
and
then
the
wise
dog
took
them
over
the
moor
and
over
the
fells
step
by
step
very
slowly
for
the
scent
was
a
day
old
you
know
and
very
light
from
the
heat
and
drought
but
that
was
why
cunning
old
sir
john
started
at
five
in
the
morning
and
at
last
he
came
to
the
top
of
lewthwaite
crag
and
there
he
bayed
and
looked
up
in
their
faces
as
much
as
to
say
tell
you
he
is
gone
down
here
they
could
hardly
believe
that
tom
would
have
gone
so
far
and
when
they
looked
at
that
awful
cliff
they
could
never
believe
that
he
would
have
dared
to
face
it
but
if
the
dog
said
so
it
must
be
true
forgive
us
said
sir
john
we
find
him
at
all
we
shall
find
him
lying
at
the
and
he
slapped
his
great
hand
upon
his
great
thigh
and
will
go
down
over
lewthwaite
crag
and
see
if
that
boy
is
alive
oh
that
i
were
twenty
years
younger
and
i
would
go
down
myself
and
so
he
would
have
done
as
well
as
any
sweep
in
the
county
then
he
pounds
to
the
man
who
brings
me
that
boy
alive
and
as
was
his
way
what
he
said
he
meant
now
among
the
lot
was
a
little
a
very
little
groom
indeed
and
he
was
the
same
who
had
ridden
up
the
court
and
told
tom
to
come
to
the
hall
and
he
pounds
or
none
i
will
go
down
over
lewthwaite
crag
if
only
for
the
poor
sake
for
he
was
as
civil
a
spoken
little
chap
as
ever
climbed
a
so
down
over
lewthwaite
crag
he
went
a
very
smart
groom
he
was
at
the
top
and
a
very
shabby
one
at
the
bottom
for
he
tore
his
gaiters
and
he
tore
his
breeches
and
he
tore
his
jacket
and
he
burst
his
braces
and
he
burst
his
boots
and
he
lost
his
hat
and
what
was
worst
of
all
he
lost
his
shirt
pin
which
he
prized
very
much
for
it
was
gold
and
he
had
won
it
in
a
raffle
at
malton
and
there
was
a
figure
at
the
top
of
it
of
mare
noble
old
beeswing
herself
as
natural
as
life
so
it
was
a
really
severe
loss
but
he
never
saw
anything
of
tom
and
all
the
while
sir
john
and
the
rest
were
riding
round
full
three
miles
to
the
right
and
back
again
to
get
into
vendale
and
to
the
foot
of
the
crag
when
they
came
to
the
old
school
all
the
children
came
out
to
see
and
the
old
dame
came
out
too
and
when
she
saw
sir
john
she
curtsied
very
low
for
she
was
a
tenant
of
his
dame
and
how
are
you
said
sir
john
on
you
as
broad
as
your
back
harthover
says
call
him
sir
john
but
only
harthover
for
that
is
the
fashion
in
the
north
welcome
into
vendale
but
no
hunting
the
fox
this
time
of
the
year
am
hunting
and
strange
game
too
said
he
on
your
heart
and
what
makes
you
look
so
sad
the
morn
looking
for
a
lost
child
a
that
is
run
harthover
harthover
says
she
were
always
a
just
man
and
a
merciful
and
no
harm
the
poor
little
lad
if
i
give
you
tidings
of
him
i
not
i
dame
afraid
we
hunted
him
out
of
the
house
all
on
a
miserable
mistake
and
the
hound
has
brought
him
to
the
top
of
lewthwaite
crag
whereat
the
old
dame
broke
out
crying
without
letting
him
finish
his
story
he
told
me
the
truth
after
all
poor
little
dear
ah
first
thoughts
are
best
and
a
guide
them
right
if
they
will
but
hearken
to
and
then
she
told
sir
john
all
the
dog
here
and
lay
him
on
said
sir
john
without
another
word
and
he
set
his
teeth
very
hard
and
the
dog
opened
at
once
and
went
away
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
over
the
road
and
over
the
meadow
and
through
a
bit
of
alder
copse
and
there
upon
an
alder
stump
they
saw
clothes
lying
and
then
they
knew
as
much
about
it
all
as
there
was
any
need
to
know
and
tom
ah
now
comes
the
most
wonderful
part
of
this
wonderful
story
tom
when
he
woke
for
of
course
he
always
wake
after
they
have
slept
exactly
as
long
as
is
good
for
himself
swimming
about
in
the
stream
being
about
four
inches
i
may
be
inches
long
and
having
round
the
parotid
region
of
his
fauces
a
set
of
external
gills
i
hope
you
understand
all
the
big
words
just
like
those
of
a
sucking
eft
which
he
mistook
for
a
lace
frill
till
he
pulled
at
them
found
he
hurt
himself
and
made
up
his
mind
that
they
were
part
of
himself
and
best
left
alone
in
fact
the
fairies
had
turned
him
into
a
a
you
never
heard
of
a
perhaps
not
that
is
the
very
reason
why
this
story
was
written
there
are
a
great
many
things
in
the
world
which
you
never
heard
of
and
a
great
many
more
which
nobody
ever
heard
of
and
a
great
many
things
too
which
nobody
will
ever
hear
of
at
least
until
the
coming
of
the
cocqcigrues
when
man
shall
be
the
measure
of
all
things
there
are
no
such
things
as
how
do
you
know
that
have
you
been
there
to
see
and
if
you
had
been
there
to
see
and
had
seen
none
that
would
not
prove
that
there
were
none
if
garth
does
not
find
a
fox
in
eversley
folks
sometimes
fear
he
never
does
not
prove
that
there
are
no
such
things
as
foxes
and
as
is
eversley
wood
to
all
the
woods
in
england
so
are
the
waters
we
know
to
all
the
waters
in
the
world
and
no
one
has
a
right
to
say
that
no
exist
till
they
have
seen
no
existing
which
is
quite
a
different
thing
mind
from
not
seeing
and
a
thing
which
nobody
ever
did
or
perhaps
ever
will
do
picture
water
baby
surely
if
there
were
somebody
would
have
caught
one
at
least
well
how
do
you
know
that
somebody
has
not
they
would
have
put
it
into
spirits
or
into
the
or
perhaps
cut
it
into
two
halves
poor
dear
little
thing
and
sent
one
to
professor
owen
and
one
to
professor
huxley
to
see
what
they
would
each
say
about
ah
my
dear
little
man
that
does
not
follow
at
all
as
you
will
see
before
the
end
of
the
story
a
is
contrary
to
well
but
my
dear
little
man
you
must
learn
to
talk
about
such
things
when
you
grow
older
in
a
very
different
way
from
that
you
must
not
talk
about
and
when
you
speak
of
this
great
wonderful
world
round
you
of
which
the
wisest
man
knows
only
the
very
smallest
corner
and
is
as
the
great
sir
isaac
newton
said
only
a
child
picking
up
pebbles
on
the
shore
of
a
boundless
ocean
picture
examining
a
water
baby
in
a
jar
you
must
not
say
that
this
can
not
be
or
that
that
is
contrary
to
nature
you
do
not
know
what
nature
is
or
what
she
can
do
and
nobody
knows
not
even
sir
roderick
murchison
or
professor
owen
or
professor
sedgwick
or
professor
huxley
or
darwin
or
professor
faraday
or
grove
or
any
other
of
the
great
men
whom
good
boys
are
taught
to
respect
they
are
very
wise
men
and
you
must
listen
respectfully
to
all
they
say
but
even
if
they
should
say
which
i
am
sure
they
never
would
can
not
exist
that
is
contrary
to
nature
you
must
wait
a
little
and
see
for
perhaps
even
they
may
be
wrong
it
is
only
children
who
read
aunt
arguments
or
cousin
conversations
or
lads
who
go
to
popular
lectures
and
see
a
man
pointing
at
a
few
big
ugly
pictures
on
the
wall
or
making
nasty
smells
with
bottles
and
squirts
for
an
hour
or
two
and
calling
that
anatomy
or
talk
about
can
not
exist
and
to
wise
men
are
afraid
to
say
that
there
is
anything
contrary
to
nature
except
what
is
contrary
to
mathematical
truth
for
two
and
two
can
not
make
five
and
two
straight
lines
can
not
join
twice
and
a
part
can
not
be
as
great
as
the
whole
and
so
on
at
least
so
it
seems
at
present
but
the
wiser
men
are
the
less
they
talk
about
can
not
that
is
a
very
rash
dangerous
word
that
can
not
and
if
people
use
it
too
often
the
queen
of
all
the
fairies
who
makes
the
clouds
thunder
and
the
fleas
bite
and
takes
just
as
much
trouble
about
one
as
about
the
other
is
apt
to
astonish
them
suddenly
by
showing
them
that
though
they
say
she
can
not
yet
she
can
and
what
is
more
will
whether
they
approve
or
not
and
therefore
it
is
that
there
are
dozens
and
hundreds
of
things
in
the
world
which
we
should
certainly
have
said
were
contrary
to
nature
if
we
did
not
see
them
going
on
under
our
eyes
all
day
long
if
people
had
never
seen
little
seeds
grow
into
great
plants
and
trees
of
quite
different
shape
from
themselves
and
these
trees
again
produce
fresh
seeds
to
grow
into
fresh
trees
they
would
have
said
thing
can
not
be
it
is
contrary
to
and
they
would
have
been
quite
as
right
in
saying
so
as
in
saying
that
most
other
things
can
not
be
or
suppose
again
that
you
had
come
like
du
chaillu
a
traveller
from
unknown
parts
and
that
no
human
being
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
an
elephant
and
suppose
that
you
described
him
to
people
and
said
is
the
shape
and
plan
and
anatomy
of
the
beast
and
of
his
feet
and
of
his
trunk
and
of
his
grinders
and
of
his
tusks
though
they
are
not
tusks
at
all
but
two
fore
teeth
run
mad
and
this
is
the
section
of
his
skull
more
like
a
mushroom
than
a
reasonable
skull
of
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable
beast
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
and
though
the
beast
which
i
assure
you
i
have
seen
and
shot
is
first
cousin
to
the
little
hairy
coney
of
scripture
second
cousin
to
a
pig
and
i
suspect
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
cousin
to
a
rabbit
yet
he
is
the
wisest
of
all
beasts
and
can
do
everything
save
read
write
and
cast
people
would
surely
have
said
your
elephant
is
contrary
to
nature
and
have
thought
you
were
telling
the
french
thought
of
le
vaillant
when
he
came
back
to
paris
and
said
that
he
had
shot
a
giraffe
and
as
the
king
of
the
cannibal
islands
thought
of
the
english
sailor
when
he
said
that
in
his
country
water
turned
to
marble
and
rain
fell
as
feathers
they
would
tell
you
the
more
they
knew
of
science
elephant
is
an
impossible
monster
contrary
to
the
laws
of
comparative
anatomy
as
far
as
yet
to
which
you
would
answer
the
less
the
more
you
thought
did
not
learned
men
too
hold
till
within
the
last
years
that
a
flying
dragon
was
an
impossible
monster
and
do
we
not
now
know
that
there
are
hundreds
of
them
found
fossil
up
and
down
the
world
people
call
them
pterodactyles
but
that
is
only
because
they
are
ashamed
to
call
them
flying
dragons
after
denying
so
long
that
flying
dragons
could
exist
the
truth
is
that
fancy
that
such
and
such
things
can
not
be
simply
because
they
have
not
seen
them
is
worth
no
more
than
a
fancy
that
there
can
not
be
such
a
thing
as
a
locomotive
because
he
never
saw
one
running
wild
in
the
forest
wise
men
know
that
their
business
is
to
examine
what
is
and
not
to
settle
what
is
not
they
know
that
there
are
elephants
they
know
that
there
have
been
flying
dragons
and
the
wiser
they
are
the
less
inclined
they
will
be
to
say
positively
that
there
are
no
no
indeed
why
wise
men
of
old
said
that
everything
on
earth
had
its
double
in
the
water
and
you
may
see
that
that
is
if
not
quite
true
still
quite
as
true
as
most
other
theories
which
you
are
likely
to
hear
for
many
a
day
there
are
why
not
there
not
and
and
and
and
and
and
and
of
there
not
so
all
these
things
are
only
nicknames
the
water
things
are
not
really
akin
to
the
land
not
always
true
they
are
in
millions
of
cases
not
only
of
the
same
family
but
actually
the
same
individual
creatures
do
not
even
you
know
that
a
green
drake
and
an
and
a
live
under
water
till
they
change
their
skins
just
as
tom
changed
his
and
if
a
water
animal
can
continually
change
into
a
land
animal
why
should
not
a
land
animal
sometimes
change
into
a
water
animal
be
put
down
by
any
of
cousin
arguments
but
stand
up
to
him
like
a
man
and
answer
him
quite
respectfully
of
course
thus
if
cousin
cramchild
says
that
if
there
are
they
must
grow
into
ask
him
how
he
knows
that
they
do
not
and
then
how
he
knows
that
they
must
any
more
than
the
proteus
of
the
adelsberg
caverns
grows
into
a
perfect
newt
if
he
says
that
it
is
too
strange
a
transformation
for
a
to
turn
into
a
ask
him
if
he
ever
heard
of
the
transformation
of
syllis
or
the
distomas
or
the
common
of
which
quatrefages
says
excellently
would
not
exclaim
that
a
miracle
had
come
to
pass
if
he
saw
a
reptile
come
out
of
the
egg
dropped
by
the
hen
in
his
and
the
reptile
give
birth
at
once
to
an
indefinite
number
of
fishes
and
birds
yet
the
history
of
the
is
quite
as
wonderful
as
that
would
ask
him
if
he
knows
about
all
this
and
if
he
does
not
tell
him
to
go
and
look
for
himself
and
advise
him
very
respectfully
of
course
to
settle
no
more
what
strange
things
can
not
happen
till
he
has
seen
what
strange
things
do
happen
every
day
if
he
says
that
things
can
not
degrade
that
is
change
downwards
into
lower
forms
ask
him
who
told
him
that
were
lower
than
but
even
if
they
were
does
he
know
about
the
strange
degradation
of
the
common
which
one
finds
sticking
on
bottoms
or
the
still
stranger
degradation
of
some
cousins
of
theirs
of
which
one
hardly
likes
to
talk
so
shocking
and
ugly
it
is
and
lastly
if
he
says
as
he
most
certainly
will
that
these
transformations
only
take
place
in
the
lower
animals
and
not
in
the
higher
say
that
that
seems
to
little
boys
and
to
some
grown
people
a
very
strange
fancy
for
if
the
changes
of
the
lower
animals
are
so
wonderful
and
so
difficult
to
discover
why
should
not
there
be
changes
in
the
higher
animals
far
more
wonderful
and
far
more
difficult
to
discover
and
may
not
man
the
crown
and
flower
of
all
things
undergo
some
change
as
much
more
wonderful
than
all
the
rest
as
the
great
exhibition
is
more
wonderful
than
a
let
him
answer
that
and
if
he
says
as
he
will
that
not
having
seen
such
a
change
in
his
experience
he
is
not
bound
to
believe
it
ask
him
respectfully
where
his
microscope
has
been
does
not
each
of
us
in
coming
into
this
world
go
through
a
transformation
just
as
wonderful
as
that
of
a
or
a
butterfly
and
do
not
reason
and
analogy
as
well
as
scripture
tell
us
that
that
transformation
is
not
the
last
and
that
though
what
we
shall
be
we
know
not
yet
we
are
here
but
as
the
crawling
caterpillar
and
shall
be
hereafter
as
the
perfect
fly
the
old
greeks
heathens
as
they
were
saw
as
much
as
that
two
thousand
years
ago
and
i
care
very
little
for
cousin
cramchild
if
he
sees
even
less
than
they
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
till
he
is
quite
cross
and
then
tell
him
that
if
there
are
no
at
least
there
ought
to
be
and
that
at
least
he
can
not
answer
and
meanwhile
my
dear
little
man
till
you
know
a
great
deal
more
about
nature
than
professor
owen
and
professor
huxley
put
together
tell
me
about
what
can
not
be
or
fancy
that
anything
is
too
wonderful
to
be
true
are
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
said
old
david
and
so
we
are
and
so
is
everything
around
us
down
to
the
very
deal
table
yes
much
more
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
already
is
the
table
as
it
stands
now
nothing
but
a
piece
of
dead
deal
wood
than
if
as
foxes
say
and
geese
believe
spirits
could
make
it
dance
or
talk
to
you
by
rapping
on
it
am
i
in
earnest
oh
dear
no
you
know
that
this
is
a
fairy
tale
and
all
fun
and
pretence
and
that
you
are
not
to
believe
one
word
of
it
even
if
it
is
true
but
at
all
events
so
it
happened
to
tom
and
therefore
the
keeper
and
the
groom
and
sir
john
made
a
great
mistake
and
were
very
unhappy
sir
john
at
least
without
any
reason
when
they
found
a
black
thing
in
the
water
and
said
it
was
body
and
that
he
had
been
drowned
they
were
utterly
mistaken
tom
was
quite
alive
and
cleaner
and
merrier
than
he
ever
had
been
the
fairies
had
washed
him
you
see
in
the
swift
river
so
thoroughly
that
not
only
his
dirt
but
his
whole
husk
and
shell
had
been
washed
quite
off
him
and
the
pretty
little
real
tom
was
washed
out
of
the
inside
of
it
and
swam
away
as
a
caddis
does
when
its
case
of
stones
and
silk
is
bored
through
and
away
it
goes
on
its
back
paddling
to
the
shore
there
to
split
its
skin
and
fly
away
as
a
caperer
on
four
wings
with
long
legs
and
horns
they
are
foolish
fellows
the
caperers
and
fly
into
the
candle
at
night
if
you
leave
the
door
open
we
will
hope
tom
will
be
wiser
now
he
has
got
safe
out
of
his
sooty
old
shell
picture
collage
of
events
but
good
sir
john
did
not
understand
all
this
not
being
a
fellow
of
the
linnæan
society
and
he
took
it
into
his
head
that
tom
was
drowned
when
they
looked
into
the
empty
pockets
of
his
shell
and
found
no
jewels
there
nor
but
three
marbles
and
a
brass
button
with
a
string
to
sir
john
did
something
as
like
crying
as
ever
he
did
in
his
life
and
blamed
himself
more
bitterly
than
he
need
have
done
so
he
cried
and
the
cried
and
the
huntsman
cried
and
the
dame
cried
and
the
little
girl
cried
and
the
dairymaid
cried
and
the
old
nurse
cried
for
it
was
somewhat
her
fault
and
my
lady
cried
for
though
people
have
wigs
that
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
have
hearts
but
the
keeper
did
not
cry
though
he
had
been
so
to
tom
the
morning
before
for
he
was
so
dried
up
with
running
after
poachers
that
you
could
no
more
get
tears
out
of
him
than
milk
out
of
leather
and
grimes
did
not
cry
for
sir
john
gave
him
ten
pounds
and
he
drank
it
all
in
a
week
sir
john
sent
far
and
wide
to
find
father
and
mother
but
he
might
have
looked
till
doomsday
for
them
for
one
was
dead
and
the
other
was
in
botany
bay
and
the
little
girl
would
not
play
with
her
dolls
for
a
whole
week
and
never
forgot
poor
little
tom
and
soon
my
lady
put
a
pretty
little
tombstone
over
shell
in
the
little
churchyard
in
vendale
where
the
old
dalesmen
all
sleep
side
by
side
between
the
crags
and
the
dame
decked
it
with
garlands
every
sunday
till
she
grew
so
old
that
she
could
not
stir
abroad
then
the
little
children
decked
it
for
her
and
always
she
sang
an
old
old
song
as
she
sat
spinning
what
she
called
her
the
children
could
not
understand
it
but
they
liked
it
none
the
less
for
that
for
it
was
very
sweet
and
very
sad
and
that
was
enough
for
them
and
these
are
the
words
of
it
all
the
world
is
all
the
trees
are
every
goose
a
every
lass
a
hey
for
boot
and
round
the
world
blood
must
have
its
every
dog
his
all
the
world
is
all
the
trees
are
all
the
sport
is
all
the
wheels
run
take
your
place
spent
and
maimed
grant
you
find
one
face
loved
when
all
was
picture
time
and
the
old
man
those
are
the
words
but
they
are
only
the
body
of
it
the
soul
of
the
song
was
the
dear
old
sweet
face
and
sweet
voice
and
the
sweet
old
air
to
which
she
sang
and
that
alas
one
can
not
put
on
paper
and
at
last
she
grew
so
stiff
and
lame
that
the
angels
were
forced
to
carry
her
and
they
helped
her
on
with
her
and
carried
her
up
over
harthover
fells
and
a
long
way
beyond
that
too
and
there
was
a
new
schoolmistress
in
vendale
and
we
will
hope
that
she
was
not
certificated
and
all
the
while
tom
was
swimming
about
in
the
river
with
a
pretty
little
of
gills
about
his
neck
as
lively
as
a
grig
and
as
clean
as
a
salmon
now
if
you
like
my
story
then
go
to
the
schoolroom
and
learn
your
and
see
if
you
like
that
better
some
people
no
doubt
would
do
so
so
much

tom
was
amphibious
and
what
is
better
still
he
was
clean
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
how
comfortable
it
was
to
have
nothing
on
him
but
himself

he
only
enjoyed

he
did
not

about

just
as
you
enjoy
life
and
health
and
yet
never

about
being

it

all
about
his
master
and
harthover
place
and
the
little
white
girl
and
in
a
word
all
that
had
happened
to
him
when
he
lived
before
and
what
was
best
of
all
he
had
forgotten
all
the
bad
words
which
he
had
learned
from
grimes
and
the
rude
boys
with
whom
he
used
to
play
that
is
not
strange
for
you
know
when
you
came
into
this
world
and
became
a
you
remembered
nothing
so
why
should
he
when
he
became
a
then
have
you
lived
before
my
dear
child
who
can
tell
one
can
only
tell
that
by
remembering
something
which
happened
where
we
lived
before
and
as
we
remember
nothing
we
know
nothing
about
it
and
no
book
and
no
man
can
ever
tell
us
certainly
there
was
a
wise
man
once
a
very
wise
man
and
a
very
good
man
who
wrote
a
poem
about
the
feelings
which
some
children
have
about
having
lived
before
and
this
is
what
he
birth
is
but
a
sleep
and
a
soul
that
rises
with
elsewhere
had
its
cometh
from
in
entire
not
in
utter
trailing
clouds
of
we
is
our
picture
woman
teacher
there
you
can
know
no
more
than
that
but
if
i
was
you
i
would
believe
that
for
then
the
great
fairy
science
who
is
likely
to
be
queen
of
all
the
fairies
for
many
a
year
to
come
can
only
do
you
good
and
never
do
you
harm
and
instead
of
fancying
with
some
people
that
your
body
makes
your
soul
as
if
a
could
make
its
own
coke
or
with
some
people
that
your
soul
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
body
but
is
only
stuck
into
it
like
a
pin
into
a
pincushion
to
fall
out
with
the
first
shake
will
believe
the
one
true
doctrine
of
this
wonderful
fairy
tale
which
is
that
your
soul
makes
your
body
just
as
a
snail
makes
his
shell
for
the
rest
it
is
enough
for
us
to
be
sure
that
whether
or
not
we
lived
before
we
shall
live
again
though
not
i
hope
as
poor
little
heathen
tom
did
for
he
went
downward
into
the
water
but
we
i
hope
shall
go
upward
to
a
very
different
place
picture
tom
in
the
stream
but
tom
was
very
happy
in
the
water
he
had
been
sadly
overworked
in
the
and
so
now
to
make
up
for
that
he
had
nothing
but
holidays
in
the
for
a
long
long
time
to
come
he
had
nothing
to
do
now
but
enjoy
himself
and
look
at
all
the
pretty
things
which
are
to
be
seen
in
the
cool
clear
where
the
sun
is
never
too
hot
and
the
frost
is
never
too
cold
picture
insect
and
what
did
he
live
on
perhaps
or
perhaps
and
too
many
do
so
likewise
but
we
do
not
know
what
of
the
eat
so
we
are
not
answerable
for
the
sometimes
he
went
along
the
smooth
gravel
looking
at
the
crickets
which
ran
in
and
out
among
the
stones
as
rabbits
do
on
land
or
he
climbed
over
the
ledges
of
rock
and
saw
the
hanging
in
thousands
with
every
one
of
them
a
pretty
little
head
and
legs
peeping
out
or
he
went
into
a
still
corner
and
watched
the
caddises
eating
dead
sticks
as
greedily
as
you
would
eat
and
building
their
houses
with
silk
and
glue
very
fanciful
ladies
they
were
none
of
them
would
keep
to
the
same
materials
for
a
day
one
would
begin
with
some
pebbles
then
she
would
stick
on
a
piece
of
green
wood
then
she
found
a
shell
and
stuck
it
on
too
and
the
poor
shell
was
alive
and
did
not
like
at
all
being
taken
to
build
houses
with
but
the
caddis
did
not
let
him
have
any
voice
in
the
matter
being
rude
and
selfish
as
vain
people
are
apt
to
be
then
she
stuck
on
a
piece
of
rotten
wood
then
a
very
smart
pink
stone
and
so
on
till
she
was
patched
all
over
like
an
coat
then
she
found
a
long
straw
five
times
as
long
as
herself
and
said
my
sister
has
a
tail
and
have
one
too
and
she
stuck
it
on
her
back
and
marched
about
with
it
quite
proud
though
it
was
very
inconvenient
indeed
and
at
that
tails
became
all
the
fashion
among
the
in
that
pool
as
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
long
pond
last
may
and
they
all
toddled
about
with
long
straws
sticking
out
behind
getting
between
each
legs
and
tumbling
over
each
other
and
looking
so
ridiculous
that
tom
laughed
at
them
till
he
cried
as
we
did
but
they
were
quite
right
you
know
for
people
must
always
follow
the
fashion
even
if
it
be
picture
lady
in
bonnet
then
sometimes
he
came
to
a
deep
still
reach
and
there
he
saw
the
they
would
have
looked
to
you
only
little
weeds
but
tom
you
must
remember
was
so
little
that
everything
looked
a
hundred
times
as
big
to
him
as
it
does
to
you
just
as
things
do
to
a
minnow
who
sees
and
catches
the
little
which
you
can
only
see
in
a
microscope
and
in
the
he
saw
the
and
they
had
all
six
legs
though
everything
almost
has
six
legs
in
the
water
except
efts
and
and
nimbly
enough
they
ran
among
the
branches
there
were
there
too
in
thousands
and
tom
tried
to
pick
them
but
as
soon
as
he
touched
them
they
drew
themselves
in
and
turned
into
knots
of
jelly
and
then
tom
saw
that
they
were
all
and
stars
and
wheels
and
flowers
of
all
beautiful
shapes
and
colours
and
all
alive
and
busy
just
as
tom
was
so
now
he
found
that
there
was
a
great
deal
more
in
the
world
than
he
had
fancied
at
first
sight
there
was
one
wonderful
little
fellow
too
who
peeped
out
of
the
top
of
a
house
built
of
round
bricks
he
had
two
big
wheels
and
one
little
one
all
over
teeth
spinning
round
and
round
like
the
wheels
in
a
and
tom
stood
and
stared
at
him
to
see
what
he
was
going
to
make
with
his
machinery
and
what
do
you
think
he
was
doing
with
his
two
big
wheels
he
swept
together
all
the
mud
which
floated
in
the
water
all
that
was
nice
in
it
he
put
into
his
stomach
and
ate
and
all
the
mud
he
put
into
the
little
wheel
on
his
breast
which
really
was
a
round
hole
set
with
teeth
and
there
he
spun
it
into
a
neat
hard
round
brick
and
then
he
took
it
and
stuck
it
on
the
top
of
his
and
set
to
work
to
make
another
now
was
not
he
a
clever
little
fellow
tom
thought
so
but
when
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him
the
was
much
too
busy
and
proud
of
his
work
to
take
notice
of
him
now
you
must
know
that
all
the
things
under
the
water
talk
only
not
such
a
language
as
ours
but
such
as
horses
and
dogs
and
cows
and
birds
talk
to
each
other
and
tom
soon
learned
to
understand
them
and
talk
to
them
so
that
he
might
have
had
very
pleasant
company
if
he
had
only
been
a
good
boy
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
was
too
like
some
other
little
boys
very
fond
of
hunting
and
tormenting
creatures
for
mere
sport
some
people
say
that
boys
can
not
help
it
that
it
is
nature
and
only
a
proof
that
we
are
all
originally
descended
from
beasts
of
prey
but
whether
it
is
nature
or
not
little
boys
can
help
it
and
must
help
it
for
if
they
have
naughty
low
mischievous
tricks
in
their
nature
as
monkeys
have
that
is
no
reason
why
they
should
give
way
to
those
tricks
like
monkeys
who
know
no
better
and
therefore
they
must
not
torment
dumb
creatures
for
if
they
do
a
certain
old
lady
who
is
coming
will
surely
give
them
exactly
what
they
deserve
but
tom
did
not
know
that
and
he
pecked
and
howked
the
poor
about
sadly
till
they
were
all
afraid
of
him
and
got
out
of
his
way
or
crept
into
their
shells
so
he
had
no
one
to
speak
to
or
play
with
the
of
course
were
very
sorry
to
see
him
so
unhappy
and
longed
to
take
him
and
tell
him
how
naughty
he
was
and
teach
him
to
be
good
and
to
play
and
romp
with
him
too
but
they
had
been
forbidden
to
do
that
tom
had
to
learn
his
lesson
for
himself
by
sound
and
sharp
experience
as
many
another
foolish
person
has
to
do
though
there
may
be
many
a
kind
heart
yearning
over
them
all
the
while
and
longing
to
teach
them
what
they
can
only
teach
themselves
at
last
one
day
he
found
a
caddis
and
wanted
it
to
peep
out
of
its
house
but
its
was
shut
he
had
never
seen
a
caddis
with
a
before
so
what
must
he
do
the
meddlesome
little
fellow
but
pull
it
open
to
see
what
the
poor
lady
was
doing
inside
what
a
shame
how
should
you
like
to
have
any
one
breaking
your
in
to
see
how
you
looked
when
you
where
in
bed
so
tom
broke
to
pieces
the
door
which
was
the
prettiest
little
grating
of
silk
stuck
all
over
with
shining
bits
of
crystal
and
when
he
looked
in
the
caddis
poked
out
her
head
and
it
had
turned
into
just
the
shape
of
a
but
when
tom
spoke
to
her
she
could
not
answer
for
her
mouth
and
face
were
tight
tied
up
in
a
new
of
neat
pink
skin
however
if
she
answer
all
the
other
caddises
did
for
they
held
up
their
hands
and
shrieked
like
the
cats
in
struwelpeter
nasty
horrid
you
are
at
it
she
had
just
laid
herself
up
for
a
then
she
would
have
come
out
with
such
beautiful
flown
laid
such
lots
of
now
you
have
broken
her
she
mend
it
because
her
mouth
is
tied
up
for
a
she
will
sent
you
here
to
worry
us
out
of
our
picture
tom
and
a
fish
so
tom
swam
away
he
was
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
and
felt
all
the
naughtier
as
little
boys
do
when
they
have
done
wrong
and
say
so
then
he
came
to
a
pool
full
of
little
trout
and
began
tormenting
them
and
trying
to
catch
them
but
they
slipped
through
his
fingers
and
jumped
clean
out
of
water
in
their
fright
but
as
tom
chased
them
he
came
close
to
a
great
dark
hover
under
an
alder
root
and
out
floushed
a
huge
old
brown
trout
ten
times
as
big
as
he
was
and
ran
right
against
him
and
knocked
all
the
breath
out
of
his
body
and
i
know
which
was
the
more
frightened
of
the
two
then
he
went
on
sulky
and
lonely
as
he
deserved
to
be
and
under
a
bank
he
saw
a
very
ugly
dirty
creature
sitting
about
half
as
big
as
himself
which
had
six
legs
and
a
big
stomach
and
a
most
ridiculous
head
with
two
great
eyes
and
a
face
just
like
a
said
tom
are
an
ugly
fellow
to
be
sure
and
he
began
making
faces
at
him
and
put
his
nose
close
to
him
and
halloed
at
him
like
a
very
rude
boy
when
hey
presto
all
the
came
off
in
a
moment
and
out
popped
a
long
arm
with
a
pair
of
pincers
at
the
end
of
it
and
caught
tom
by
the
nose
it
did
not
hurt
him
much
but
it
held
him
quite
tight
ah
oh
let
me
go
cried
tom
let
me
go
said
the
creature
want
to
be
quiet
i
want
to
tom
promised
to
let
him
alone
and
he
let
go
do
you
want
to
split
said
tom
my
brothers
and
sisters
have
all
split
and
turned
into
beautiful
creatures
with
wings
and
i
want
to
split
too
speak
to
me
i
am
sure
i
shall
split
i
will
split
tom
stood
still
and
watched
him
and
he
swelled
himself
and
puffed
and
stretched
himself
out
stiff
and
at
puff
opened
all
down
his
back
and
then
up
to
the
top
of
his
head
and
out
of
his
inside
came
the
most
slender
elegant
soft
creature
as
soft
and
smooth
as
tom
but
very
pale
and
weak
like
a
little
child
who
has
been
ill
a
long
time
in
a
dark
room
it
moved
its
legs
very
feebly
and
looked
about
it
half
ashamed
like
a
girl
when
she
goes
for
the
first
time
into
a
ballroom
and
then
it
began
walking
slowly
up
a
grass
stem
to
the
top
of
the
water
tom
was
so
astonished
that
he
never
said
a
word
but
he
stared
with
all
his
eyes
and
he
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
water
too
and
peeped
out
to
see
what
would
happen
and
as
the
creature
sat
in
the
warm
bright
sun
a
wonderful
change
came
over
it
it
grew
strong
and
firm
the
most
lovely
colours
began
to
show
on
its
body
blue
and
yellow
and
black
spots
and
bars
and
rings
out
of
its
back
rose
four
great
wings
of
bright
brown
gauze
and
its
eyes
grew
so
large
that
they
filled
all
its
head
and
shone
like
ten
thousand
diamonds
you
beautiful
creature
said
tom
and
he
put
out
his
hand
to
catch
it
but
the
thing
whirred
up
into
the
air
and
hung
poised
on
its
wings
a
moment
and
then
settled
down
again
by
tom
quite
fearless
picture
tom
and
the
it
said
can
not
catch
me
i
am
a
now
the
king
of
all
the
flies
and
i
shall
dance
in
the
sunshine
and
hawk
over
the
river
and
catch
gnats
and
have
a
beautiful
wife
like
myself
i
know
what
i
shall
do
hurrah
and
he
flew
away
into
the
air
and
began
catching
gnats
come
back
come
back
cried
tom
beautiful
creature
i
have
no
one
to
play
with
and
i
am
so
lonely
here
if
you
will
but
come
back
i
will
never
try
to
catch
care
whether
you
do
or
not
said
the
you
but
when
i
have
had
my
dinner
and
looked
a
little
about
this
pretty
place
i
will
come
back
and
have
a
little
chat
about
all
i
have
seen
in
my
travels
why
what
a
huge
tree
this
is
and
what
huge
leaves
on
it
it
was
only
a
big
dock
but
you
know
the
had
never
seen
any
but
little
starwort
and
milfoil
and
and
such
like
so
it
did
look
very
big
to
him
besides
he
was
very
as
all
are
and
never
could
see
a
yard
before
his
nose
any
more
than
a
great
many
other
folks
who
are
not
half
as
handsome
as
he
the
did
come
back
and
chatted
away
with
tom
he
was
a
little
conceited
about
his
fine
colours
and
his
large
wings
but
you
know
he
had
been
a
poor
dirty
ugly
creature
all
his
life
before
so
there
were
great
excuses
for
him
he
was
very
fond
of
talking
about
all
the
wonderful
things
he
saw
in
the
trees
and
the
meadows
and
tom
liked
to
listen
to
him
for
he
had
forgotten
all
about
them
so
in
a
little
while
they
became
great
friends
and
i
am
very
glad
to
say
that
tom
learned
such
a
lesson
that
day
that
he
did
not
torment
creatures
for
a
long
time
after
and
then
the
caddises
grew
quite
tame
and
used
to
tell
him
strange
stories
about
the
way
they
built
their
houses
and
changed
their
skins
and
turned
at
last
into
winged
flies
till
tom
began
to
long
to
change
his
skin
and
have
wings
like
them
some
day
picture
acrobat
and
the
trout
and
he
made
it
up
for
trout
very
soon
forget
if
they
have
been
frightened
and
hurt
so
tom
used
to
play
with
them
at
hare
and
hounds
and
great
fun
they
had
and
he
used
to
try
to
leap
out
of
the
water
head
over
heels
as
they
did
before
a
shower
came
on
but
somehow
he
never
could
manage
it
he
liked
most
though
to
see
them
rising
at
the
flies
as
they
sailed
round
and
round
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
oak
where
the
beetles
fell
flop
into
the
water
and
the
green
caterpillars
let
themselves
down
from
the
boughs
by
silk
ropes
for
no
reason
at
all
and
then
changed
their
foolish
minds
for
no
reason
at
all
either
and
hauled
themselves
up
again
into
the
tree
rolling
up
the
rope
in
a
ball
between
their
paws
which
is
a
very
clever
trick
and
neither
blondin
nor
leotard
could
do
it
but
why
they
should
take
so
much
trouble
about
it
no
one
can
tell
for
they
can
not
get
their
living
as
blondin
and
leotard
do
by
trying
to
break
their
necks
on
a
string
and
very
often
tom
caught
them
just
as
they
touched
the
water
and
caught
the
and
the
caperers
and
the
duns
and
spinners
yellow
and
brown
and
claret
and
gray
and
gave
them
to
his
friends
the
trout
perhaps
he
was
not
quite
kind
to
the
flies
but
one
must
do
a
good
turn
to
friends
when
one
can
and
at
last
he
gave
up
catching
even
the
flies
for
he
made
acquaintance
with
one
by
accident
and
found
him
a
very
merry
little
fellow
and
this
was
the
way
it
happened
and
it
is
all
quite
true
he
was
basking
at
the
top
of
the
water
one
hot
day
in
july
catching
duns
and
feeding
the
trout
when
he
saw
a
new
sort
a
dark
gray
little
fellow
with
a
brown
head
he
was
a
very
little
fellow
indeed
but
he
made
the
most
of
himself
as
people
ought
to
do
he
cocked
up
his
head
and
he
cocked
up
his
wings
and
he
cocked
up
his
tail
and
he
cocked
up
the
two
whisks
at
his
and
in
short
he
looked
the
cockiest
little
man
of
all
little
men
and
so
he
proved
to
be
for
instead
of
getting
away
he
hopped
upon
finger
and
sat
there
as
bold
as
nine
tailors
and
he
cried
out
in
the
tiniest
shrillest
squeakiest
little
voice
you
ever
heard
obliged
to
you
indeed
but
i
want
it
what
said
tom
quite
taken
aback
by
his
impudence
leg
which
you
are
kind
enough
to
hold
out
for
me
to
sit
on
i
must
just
go
and
see
after
my
wife
for
a
few
minutes
dear
me
what
a
troublesome
business
a
family
is
though
the
idle
little
rogue
did
nothing
at
all
but
left
his
poor
wife
to
lay
all
the
eggs
by
herself
i
come
back
i
shall
be
glad
of
it
if
be
so
good
as
to
keep
it
sticking
out
just
so
and
off
he
flew
tom
thought
him
a
very
cool
sort
of
personage
and
still
more
so
when
in
five
minutes
he
came
back
and
you
were
tired
waiting
well
your
other
leg
will
do
as
and
he
popped
himself
down
on
knee
and
began
chatting
away
in
his
squeaking
voice
you
live
under
the
water
a
low
place
i
lived
there
for
some
time
and
was
very
shabby
and
dirty
but
i
choose
that
that
should
last
so
i
turned
respectable
and
came
up
to
the
top
and
put
on
this
gray
suit
a
very
suit
you
think
you
neat
and
quiet
indeed
said
tom
one
must
be
quiet
and
neat
and
respectable
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
for
a
little
when
one
becomes
a
family
man
but
tired
of
it
the
truth
done
quite
enough
business
i
consider
in
the
last
week
to
last
me
my
life
so
i
shall
put
on
a
ball
dress
and
go
out
and
be
a
smart
man
and
see
the
gay
world
and
have
a
dance
or
two
why
one
be
jolly
if
one
can
what
will
become
of
your
wife
she
is
a
very
plain
stupid
creature
and
the
truth
and
thinks
about
nothing
but
eggs
if
she
chooses
to
come
why
she
may
and
if
not
why
i
go
without
her
here
i
and
as
he
spoke
he
turned
quite
pale
and
then
quite
white
ill
said
tom
but
he
did
not
answer
dead
said
tom
looking
at
him
as
he
stood
on
his
knee
as
white
as
a
ghost
i
answered
a
little
squeaking
voice
over
his
head
is
me
up
here
in
my
and
my
skin
ha
ha
you
could
not
do
such
a
trick
as
that
and
no
more
tom
could
nor
houdin
nor
robin
nor
frikell
nor
all
the
conjurors
in
the
world
for
the
little
rogue
had
jumped
clean
out
of
his
own
skin
and
left
it
standing
on
knee
eyes
wings
legs
tail
exactly
as
if
it
had
been
alive
ha
he
said
and
he
jerked
and
skipped
up
and
down
never
stopping
an
instant
just
as
if
he
had
dance
i
a
pretty
fellow
now
and
so
he
was
for
his
body
was
white
and
his
tail
orange
and
his
eyes
all
the
colours
of
a
tail
and
what
was
the
oddest
of
all
the
whisks
at
the
end
of
his
tail
had
grown
five
times
as
long
as
they
were
before
said
he
i
will
see
the
gay
world
my
living
cost
me
much
for
i
have
no
mouth
you
see
and
no
inside
so
i
can
never
be
hungry
nor
have
the
no
more
he
had
he
had
grown
as
dry
and
hard
and
empty
as
a
quill
as
such
silly
fellows
deserve
to
grow
but
instead
of
being
ashamed
of
his
emptiness
he
was
quite
proud
of
it
as
a
good
many
fine
gentlemen
are
and
began
flirting
and
flipping
up
and
down
and
wife
shall
i
shall
merrily
pass
the
i
hold
it
for
quite
the
wisest
drive
dull
care
and
he
danced
up
and
down
for
three
days
and
three
nights
till
he
grew
so
tired
that
he
tumbled
into
the
water
and
floated
down
but
what
became
of
him
tom
never
knew
and
he
himself
never
minded
for
tom
heard
him
singing
to
the
last
as
he
floated
drive
dull
care
and
if
he
did
not
care
why
nobody
else
cared
either
but
one
day
tom
had
a
new
adventure
he
was
sitting
on
a
leaf
he
and
his
friend
the
watching
the
gnats
dance
the
had
eaten
as
many
as
he
wanted
and
was
sitting
quite
still
and
sleepy
for
it
was
very
hot
and
bright
the
gnats
who
did
not
care
the
least
for
their
poor
death
danced
a
foot
over
his
head
quite
happily
and
a
large
black
fly
settled
within
an
inch
of
his
nose
and
began
washing
his
own
face
and
combing
his
hair
with
his
paws
but
the
never
stirred
and
kept
on
chatting
to
tom
about
the
times
when
he
lived
under
the
water
suddenly
tom
heard
the
strangest
noise
up
the
stream
cooing
and
grunting
and
whining
and
squeaking
as
if
you
had
put
into
a
bag
two
nine
mice
three
and
a
blind
puppy
and
left
them
there
to
settle
themselves
and
make
music
he
looked
up
the
water
and
there
he
saw
a
sight
as
strange
as
the
noise
a
great
ball
rolling
over
and
over
down
the
stream
seeming
one
moment
of
soft
brown
fur
and
the
next
of
shining
glass
and
yet
it
was
not
a
ball
for
sometimes
it
broke
up
and
streamed
away
in
pieces
and
then
it
joined
again
and
all
the
while
the
noise
came
out
of
it
louder
and
louder
tom
asked
the
what
it
could
be
but
of
course
with
his
short
sight
he
could
not
even
see
it
though
it
was
not
ten
yards
away
so
he
took
the
neatest
little
header
into
the
water
and
started
off
to
see
for
himself
and
when
he
came
near
the
ball
turned
out
to
be
four
or
five
beautiful
creatures
many
times
larger
than
tom
who
were
swimming
about
and
rolling
and
diving
and
twisting
and
wrestling
and
cuddling
and
kissing
and
biting
and
scratching
in
the
most
charming
fashion
that
ever
was
seen
and
if
you
believe
me
you
may
go
to
the
zoological
gardens
for
i
am
afraid
that
you
see
it
nearer
unless
perhaps
you
get
up
at
five
in
the
morning
and
go
down
to
moor
and
watch
by
the
great
withy
pollard
which
hangs
over
the
backwater
where
the
otters
breed
sometimes
and
then
say
if
otters
at
play
in
the
water
are
not
the
merriest
lithest
gracefullest
creatures
you
ever
saw
but
when
the
biggest
of
them
saw
tom
she
darted
out
from
the
rest
and
cried
in
the
sharply
enough
children
here
is
something
to
eat
indeed
and
came
at
poor
tom
showing
such
a
wicked
pair
of
eyes
and
such
a
set
of
sharp
teeth
in
a
grinning
mouth
that
tom
who
had
thought
her
very
handsome
said
to
himself
is
that
handsome
and
slipped
in
between
the
roots
as
fast
as
he
could
and
then
turned
round
and
made
faces
at
her
out
said
the
wicked
old
otter
it
will
be
worse
for
but
tom
looked
at
her
from
between
two
thick
roots
and
shook
them
with
all
his
might
making
horrible
faces
all
the
while
just
as
he
used
to
grin
through
the
railings
at
the
old
women
when
he
lived
before
it
was
not
quite
well
bred
no
doubt
but
you
know
tom
had
not
finished
his
education
yet
picture
the
otter
away
children
said
the
otter
in
disgust
is
not
worth
eating
after
all
it
is
only
a
nasty
eft
which
nothing
eats
not
even
those
vulgar
pike
in
the
am
not
an
eft
said
tom
have
are
an
eft
said
the
otter
very
positively
see
your
two
hands
quite
plain
and
i
know
you
have
a
tell
you
i
have
not
said
tom
here
and
he
turned
his
pretty
little
self
quite
round
and
sure
enough
he
had
no
more
tail
than
you
the
otter
might
have
got
out
of
it
by
saying
that
tom
was
a
frog
but
like
a
great
many
other
people
when
she
had
once
said
a
thing
she
stood
to
it
right
or
wrong
so
she
answered
say
you
are
an
eft
and
therefore
you
are
and
not
fit
food
for
gentlefolk
like
me
and
my
children
you
may
stay
there
till
the
salmon
eat
you
she
knew
the
salmon
would
not
but
she
wanted
to
frighten
poor
tom
ha
ha
they
will
eat
you
and
we
will
eat
them
and
the
otter
laughed
such
a
wicked
cruel
you
may
hear
them
do
sometimes
and
the
first
time
that
you
hear
it
you
will
probably
think
it
is
bogies
are
salmon
asked
tom
you
eft
great
fish
nice
fish
to
eat
they
are
the
lords
of
the
fish
and
we
are
lords
of
the
salmon
and
she
laughed
again
hunt
them
up
and
down
the
pools
and
drive
them
up
into
a
corner
the
silly
things
they
are
so
proud
and
bully
the
little
trout
and
the
minnows
till
they
see
us
coming
and
then
they
are
so
meek
all
at
once
and
we
catch
them
but
we
disdain
to
eat
them
all
we
just
bite
out
their
soft
throats
and
suck
their
sweet
so
good
and
she
licked
her
wicked
lips
then
throw
them
away
and
go
and
catch
another
they
are
coming
soon
children
coming
soon
i
can
smell
the
rain
coming
up
off
the
sea
and
then
hurrah
for
a
fresh
and
salmon
and
plenty
of
eating
all
day
picture
tom
and
the
otter
and
the
otter
grew
so
proud
that
she
turned
head
over
heels
twice
and
then
stood
upright
half
out
of
the
water
grinning
like
a
cheshire
cat
where
do
they
come
from
asked
tom
who
kept
himself
very
close
for
he
was
considerably
frightened
of
the
sea
eft
the
great
wide
sea
where
they
might
stay
and
be
safe
if
they
liked
but
out
of
the
sea
the
silly
things
come
into
the
great
river
down
below
and
we
come
up
to
watch
for
them
and
when
they
go
down
again
we
go
down
and
follow
them
and
there
we
fish
for
the
bass
and
the
pollock
and
have
jolly
days
along
the
shore
and
toss
and
roll
in
the
breakers
and
sleep
snug
in
the
warm
dry
crags
ah
that
is
a
merry
life
too
children
if
it
were
not
for
those
horrid
are
men
asked
tom
but
somehow
he
seemed
to
know
before
he
asked
things
eft
and
now
i
come
to
look
at
you
they
are
actually
something
like
you
if
you
had
not
a
she
was
determined
that
tom
should
have
a
tail
a
great
deal
bigger
worse
luck
for
us
and
they
catch
the
fish
with
hooks
and
lines
which
get
into
our
feet
sometimes
and
set
pots
along
the
rocks
to
catch
lobsters
they
speared
my
poor
dear
husband
as
he
went
out
to
find
something
for
me
to
eat
i
was
laid
up
among
the
crags
then
and
we
were
very
low
in
the
world
for
the
sea
was
so
rough
that
no
fish
would
come
in
shore
but
they
speared
him
poor
fellow
and
i
saw
them
carrying
him
away
upon
a
pole
all
he
lost
his
life
for
your
sakes
my
children
poor
dear
obedient
creature
that
he
and
the
otter
grew
so
sentimental
for
otters
can
be
very
sentimental
when
they
choose
like
a
good
many
people
who
are
both
cruel
and
greedy
and
no
good
to
anybody
at
all
that
she
sailed
solemnly
away
down
the
burn
and
tom
saw
her
no
more
for
that
time
and
lucky
it
was
for
her
that
she
did
so
for
no
sooner
was
she
gone
than
down
the
bank
came
seven
little
rough
terrier
doors
snuffing
and
yapping
and
grubbing
and
splashing
in
full
cry
after
the
otter
tom
hid
among
the
till
they
were
gone
for
he
could
not
guess
that
they
were
the
come
to
help
him
but
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
what
the
otter
had
said
about
the
great
river
and
the
broad
sea
and
as
he
thought
he
longed
to
go
and
see
them
he
could
not
tell
why
but
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
grew
discontented
with
the
narrow
little
stream
in
which
he
lived
and
all
his
companions
there
and
wanted
to
get
out
into
the
wide
wide
world
and
enjoy
all
the
wonderful
sights
of
which
he
was
sure
it
was
full
and
once
he
set
off
to
go
down
the
stream
but
the
stream
was
very
low
and
when
he
came
to
the
shallows
he
could
not
keep
under
water
for
there
was
no
water
left
to
keep
under
so
the
sun
burned
his
back
and
made
him
sick
and
he
went
back
again
and
lay
quiet
in
the
pool
for
a
whole
week
more
and
then
on
the
evening
of
a
very
hot
day
he
saw
a
sight
he
had
been
very
stupid
all
day
and
so
had
the
trout
for
they
would
not
move
an
inch
to
take
a
fly
though
there
were
thousands
on
the
water
but
lay
dozing
at
the
bottom
under
the
shade
of
the
stones
and
tom
lay
dozing
too
and
was
glad
to
cuddle
their
smooth
cool
sides
for
the
water
was
quite
warm
and
unpleasant
but
toward
evening
it
grew
suddenly
dark
and
tom
looked
up
and
saw
a
blanket
of
black
clouds
lying
right
across
the
valley
above
his
head
resting
on
the
crags
right
and
left
he
felt
not
quite
frightened
but
very
still
for
everything
was
still
there
was
not
a
whisper
of
wind
nor
a
chirp
of
a
bird
to
be
heard
and
next
a
few
great
drops
of
rain
fell
plop
into
the
water
and
one
hit
tom
on
the
nose
and
made
him
pop
his
head
down
quickly
enough
and
then
the
thunder
roared
and
the
lightning
flashed
and
leapt
across
vendale
and
back
again
from
cloud
to
cloud
and
cliff
to
cliff
till
the
very
rocks
in
the
stream
seemed
to
shake
and
tom
looked
up
at
it
through
the
water
and
thought
it
the
finest
thing
he
ever
saw
in
his
life
but
out
of
the
water
he
dared
not
put
his
head
for
the
rain
came
down
by
bucketsful
and
the
hail
hammered
like
shot
on
the
stream
and
churned
it
into
foam
and
soon
the
stream
rose
and
rushed
down
higher
and
higher
and
fouler
and
fouler
full
of
beetles
and
sticks
and
straws
and
worms
and
and
and
leeches
and
odds
and
ends
and
and
this
that
and
the
other
enough
to
fill
nine
museums
tom
could
hardly
stand
against
the
stream
and
hid
behind
a
rock
but
the
trout
did
not
for
out
they
rushed
from
among
the
stones
and
began
gobbling
the
beetles
and
leeches
in
the
most
greedy
and
quarrelsome
way
and
swimming
about
with
great
worms
hanging
out
of
their
mouths
tugging
and
kicking
to
get
them
away
from
each
other
and
now
by
the
flashes
of
the
lightning
tom
saw
a
new
the
bottom
of
the
stream
alive
with
great
eels
turning
and
twisting
along
all
down
stream
and
away
they
had
been
hiding
for
weeks
past
in
the
cracks
of
the
rocks
and
in
burrows
in
the
mud
and
tom
had
hardly
ever
seen
them
except
now
and
then
at
night
but
now
they
were
all
out
and
went
hurrying
past
him
so
fiercely
and
wildly
that
he
was
quite
frightened
and
as
they
hurried
past
he
could
hear
them
say
to
each
other
must
run
we
must
run
what
a
jolly
thunderstorm
down
to
the
sea
down
to
the
sea
and
then
the
otter
came
by
with
all
her
brood
twining
and
sweeping
along
as
fast
as
the
eels
themselves
and
she
spied
tom
as
she
came
by
and
said
is
your
time
eft
if
you
want
to
see
the
world
come
along
children
never
mind
those
nasty
eels
we
shall
breakfast
on
salmon
down
to
the
sea
down
to
the
sea
picture
tom
with
the
eels
then
came
a
flash
brighter
than
all
the
rest
and
by
the
light
of
the
thousandth
part
of
a
second
they
were
gone
he
had
seen
them
he
was
certain
of
beautiful
little
white
girls
with
their
arms
twined
round
each
necks
floating
down
the
torrent
as
they
sang
to
the
sea
down
to
the
sea
stay
wait
for
me
cried
tom
but
they
were
gone
yet
he
could
hear
their
voices
clear
and
sweet
through
the
roar
of
thunder
and
water
and
wind
singing
as
they
died
away
to
the
sea
to
the
sea
said
tom
is
going
to
the
sea
and
i
will
go
too
but
the
trout
were
so
busy
gobbling
worms
that
they
never
turned
to
answer
him
so
that
tom
was
spared
the
pain
of
bidding
them
farewell
and
now
down
the
rushing
stream
guided
by
the
bright
flashes
of
the
storm
past
tall
rocks
which
shone
out
one
moment
as
clear
as
day
and
the
next
were
dark
as
night
past
dark
hovers
under
swirling
banks
from
which
great
trout
rushed
out
on
tom
thinking
him
to
be
good
to
eat
and
turned
back
sulkily
for
the
fairies
sent
them
home
again
with
a
tremendous
scolding
for
daring
to
meddle
with
a
on
through
narrow
strids
and
roaring
cataracts
where
tom
was
deafened
and
blinded
for
a
moment
by
the
rushing
waters
along
deep
reaches
where
the
white
tossed
and
flapped
beneath
the
wind
and
hail
past
sleeping
villages
under
dark
and
away
and
away
to
the
sea
and
tom
could
not
stop
and
did
not
care
to
stop
he
would
see
the
great
world
below
and
the
salmon
and
the
breakers
and
the
wide
wide
sea
and
when
the
daylight
came
tom
found
himself
out
in
the
salmon
river
and
what
sort
of
a
river
was
it
was
it
like
an
irish
stream
winding
through
the
brown
bogs
where
the
wild
ducks
squatter
up
from
among
the
white
and
the
curlews
flit
to
and
fro
crying
mind
your
sheep
and
dennis
tells
you
strange
stories
of
the
peishtamore
the
great
which
lies
in
the
black
peat
pools
among
the
old
and
puts
his
head
out
at
night
to
snap
at
the
cattle
as
they
come
down
to
drink
you
must
not
believe
all
that
dennis
tells
you
mind
for
if
you
ask
him
there
a
salmon
here
do
you
think
dennis
it
salmon
thin
your
honour
manes
salmon
cartloads
it
is
of
thim
thin
ridgmens
shouldthering
ache
out
of
water
but
the
luck
to
see
then
you
fish
the
pool
all
over
and
never
get
a
rise
there
be
a
salmon
here
dennis
and
if
but
think
if
one
had
come
up
last
tide
be
gone
to
the
higher
pools
by
picture
dennis
with
pigs
thin
and
your
the
thrue
fisherman
and
understands
it
all
like
a
book
why
ye
spake
as
if
known
the
wather
a
thousand
years
as
i
said
how
could
there
be
a
fish
here
at
all
just
now
you
said
just
now
they
were
shouldering
each
other
out
of
water
and
then
dennis
will
look
up
at
you
with
his
handsome
sly
soft
sleepy
untrustable
irish
gray
eye
and
answer
with
the
prettiest
smile
and
i
think
your
honour
would
like
a
pleasant
answer
so
you
must
not
trust
dennis
because
he
is
in
the
habit
of
giving
pleasant
answers
but
instead
of
being
angry
with
him
you
must
remember
that
he
is
a
poor
paddy
and
knows
no
better
so
you
must
just
burst
out
laughing
and
then
he
will
burst
out
laughing
too
and
slave
for
you
and
trot
about
after
you
and
show
you
good
sport
if
he
he
is
an
affectionate
fellow
and
as
fond
of
sport
as
you
if
he
tell
you
fibs
instead
a
hundred
an
hour
and
wonder
all
the
while
why
poor
ould
ireland
does
not
prosper
like
england
and
scotland
and
some
other
places
where
folk
have
taken
up
a
ridiculous
fancy
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
or
was
it
like
a
welsh
salmon
river
which
is
remarkable
chiefly
at
least
till
this
last
year
for
containing
no
salmon
as
they
have
been
all
poached
out
by
the
enlightened
peasantry
to
prevent
the
which
means
you
my
little
dear
your
kith
and
kin
and
signifies
much
the
same
as
the
chinese
from
coming
bothering
into
wales
with
good
tackle
and
ready
money
and
civilisation
and
common
honesty
and
other
like
things
of
which
the
cymry
stand
in
no
need
whatsoever
or
was
it
such
a
salmon
stream
as
i
trust
you
will
see
among
the
hampshire
before
your
hairs
are
gray
under
the
wise
new
winchester
apprentices
shall
covenant
as
they
did
three
hundred
years
ago
not
to
be
made
to
eat
salmon
more
than
three
days
a
week
and
fish
shall
be
as
plentiful
under
salisbury
spire
as
they
are
in
at
christchurch
in
the
good
time
coming
when
folks
shall
see
that
of
all
gifts
of
food
the
one
to
be
protected
most
carefully
is
that
worthy
gentleman
salmon
who
is
generous
enough
to
go
down
to
the
sea
weighing
five
ounces
and
to
come
back
next
year
weighing
five
pounds
without
having
cost
the
soil
or
the
state
one
farthing
or
was
it
like
a
scotch
stream
such
as
arthur
clough
drew
in
his
over
a
ledge
of
a
granite
bason
the
amber
torrent
there
for
the
colour
derived
from
green
rocks
most
of
beads
of
foam
their
clouds
of
white
with
the
delicate
hue
of
the
over
cliff
for
its
rowan
and
pendant
birch
ah
my
little
man
when
you
are
a
big
man
and
fish
such
a
stream
as
that
you
will
hardly
care
i
think
whether
she
be
roaring
down
in
full
spate
like
coffee
covered
with
scald
cream
while
the
fish
are
swirling
at
your
fly
as
an
swirls
in
a
or
flashing
up
the
cataract
like
silver
arrows
out
of
the
fiercest
of
the
foam
or
whether
the
fall
be
dwindled
to
a
single
thread
and
the
shingle
below
be
as
white
and
dusty
as
a
turnpike
road
while
the
salmon
huddle
together
in
one
dark
cloud
in
the
clear
amber
pool
sleeping
away
their
time
till
the
rain
creeps
back
again
off
the
sea
you
will
not
care
much
if
you
have
eyes
and
brains
for
you
will
lay
down
your
rod
contentedly
and
drink
in
at
your
eyes
the
beauty
of
that
glorious
place
and
listen
to
the
piping
on
the
stones
and
watch
the
yellow
roes
come
down
to
drink
and
look
up
at
you
with
their
great
soft
trustful
eyes
as
much
as
to
say
could
not
have
the
heart
to
shoot
at
us
and
then
if
you
have
sense
you
will
turn
and
talk
to
the
great
giant
of
a
gilly
who
lies
basking
on
the
stone
beside
you
he
will
tell
you
no
fibs
my
little
man
for
he
is
a
scotchman
and
fears
god
and
not
the
priest
and
as
you
talk
with
him
you
will
be
surprised
more
and
more
at
his
knowledge
his
sense
his
humour
his
courtesy
and
you
will
find
you
have
found
it
out
a
man
may
learn
from
his
bible
to
be
a
more
thorough
gentleman
than
if
he
had
been
brought
up
in
all
the
in
london
picture
scotsman
no
it
was
none
of
these
the
salmon
stream
at
harthover
it
was
such
a
stream
as
you
see
in
dear
old
bewick
bewick
who
was
born
and
bred
upon
them
a
full
hundred
yards
broad
it
was
sliding
on
from
broad
pool
to
broad
shallow
and
broad
shallow
to
broad
pool
over
great
fields
of
shingle
under
oak
and
ash
coverts
past
low
cliffs
of
sandstone
past
green
meadows
and
fair
parks
and
a
great
house
of
gray
stone
and
brown
moors
above
and
here
and
there
against
the
sky
the
smoking
chimney
of
a
colliery
you
must
look
at
bewick
to
see
just
what
it
was
like
for
he
has
drawn
it
a
hundred
times
with
the
care
and
the
love
of
a
true
north
countryman
and
even
if
you
do
not
care
about
the
salmon
river
you
ought
like
all
good
boys
to
know
your
bewick
at
least
so
old
sir
john
used
to
say
and
very
sensibly
he
put
it
too
as
he
was
wont
to
do
they
want
to
describe
a
finished
young
gentleman
in
france
i
hear
they
say
of
him
sait
son
but
if
i
want
to
describe
one
in
england
i
say
knows
his
and
i
think
that
is
the
higher
but
tom
thought
nothing
about
what
the
river
was
like
all
his
fancy
was
to
get
down
to
the
wide
wide
sea
and
after
a
while
he
came
to
a
place
where
the
river
spread
out
into
broad
still
shallow
reaches
so
wide
that
little
tom
as
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
water
could
hardly
see
across
and
there
he
stopped
he
got
a
little
frightened
must
be
the
sea
he
thought
a
wide
place
it
is
if
i
go
on
into
it
i
shall
surely
lose
my
way
or
some
strange
thing
will
bite
me
i
will
stop
here
and
look
out
for
the
otter
or
the
eels
or
some
one
to
tell
me
where
i
shall
so
he
went
back
a
little
way
and
crept
into
a
crack
of
the
rock
just
where
the
river
opened
out
into
the
wide
shallows
and
watched
for
some
one
to
tell
him
his
way
but
the
otter
and
the
eels
were
gone
on
miles
and
miles
down
the
stream
there
he
waited
and
slept
too
for
he
was
quite
tired
with
his
journey
and
when
he
woke
the
stream
was
clearing
to
a
beautiful
amber
hue
though
it
was
still
very
high
and
after
a
while
he
saw
a
sight
which
made
him
jump
up
for
he
knew
in
a
moment
it
was
one
of
the
things
which
he
had
come
to
look
for
such
a
fish
ten
times
as
big
as
the
biggest
trout
and
a
hundred
times
as
big
as
tom
sculling
up
the
stream
past
him
as
easily
as
tom
had
sculled
down
such
a
fish
shining
silver
from
head
to
tail
and
here
and
there
a
crimson
dot
with
a
grand
hooked
nose
and
grand
curling
lip
and
a
grand
bright
eye
looking
round
him
as
proudly
as
a
king
and
surveying
the
water
right
and
left
as
if
all
belonged
to
him
surely
he
must
be
the
salmon
the
king
of
all
the
fish
picture
tom
and
the
salmon
tom
was
so
frightened
that
he
longed
to
creep
into
a
hole
but
he
need
not
have
been
for
salmon
are
all
true
gentlemen
and
like
true
gentlemen
they
look
noble
and
proud
enough
and
yet
like
true
gentlemen
they
never
harm
or
quarrel
with
any
one
but
go
about
their
own
business
and
leave
rude
fellows
to
themselves
the
salmon
looked
at
him
full
in
the
face
and
then
went
on
without
minding
him
with
a
swish
or
two
of
his
tail
which
made
the
stream
boil
again
and
in
a
few
minutes
came
another
and
then
four
or
five
and
so
on
and
all
passed
tom
rushing
and
plunging
up
the
cataract
with
strong
strokes
of
their
silver
tails
now
and
then
leaping
clean
out
of
water
and
up
over
a
rock
shining
gloriously
for
a
moment
in
the
bright
sun
while
tom
was
so
delighted
that
he
could
have
watched
them
all
day
long
and
at
last
one
came
up
bigger
than
all
the
rest
but
he
came
slowly
and
stopped
and
looked
back
and
seemed
very
anxious
and
busy
and
tom
saw
that
he
was
helping
another
salmon
an
especially
handsome
one
who
had
not
a
single
spot
upon
it
but
was
clothed
in
pure
silver
from
nose
to
tail
dear
said
the
great
fish
to
his
companion
really
look
dreadfully
tired
and
you
must
not
yourself
at
first
do
rest
yourself
behind
this
rock
and
he
shoved
her
gently
with
his
nose
to
the
rock
where
tom
sat
you
must
know
that
this
was
the
wife
for
salmon
like
other
true
gentlemen
always
choose
their
lady
and
love
her
and
are
true
to
her
and
take
care
of
her
and
work
for
her
and
fight
for
her
as
every
true
gentleman
ought
and
are
not
like
vulgar
chub
and
roach
and
pike
who
have
no
high
feelings
and
take
no
care
of
their
wives
then
he
saw
tom
and
looked
at
him
very
fiercely
one
moment
as
if
he
was
going
to
bite
him
do
you
want
here
he
said
very
fiercely
hurt
me
cried
tom
only
want
to
look
at
you
you
are
so
said
the
salmon
very
stately
but
very
civilly
really
beg
your
pardon
i
see
what
you
are
my
little
dear
i
have
met
one
or
two
creatures
like
you
before
and
found
them
very
agreeable
and
indeed
one
of
them
showed
me
a
great
kindness
lately
which
i
hope
to
be
able
to
repay
i
hope
we
shall
not
be
in
your
way
here
as
soon
as
this
lady
is
rested
we
shall
proceed
on
our
what
a
old
salmon
he
was
you
have
seen
things
like
me
before
asked
tom
times
my
dear
indeed
it
was
only
last
night
that
one
at
the
mouth
came
and
warned
me
and
my
wife
of
some
new
which
had
got
into
the
stream
i
can
not
tell
how
since
last
winter
and
showed
us
the
way
round
them
in
the
most
charmingly
obliging
there
are
babies
in
the
sea
cried
tom
and
clapped
his
little
hands
i
shall
have
some
one
to
play
with
there
how
delightful
there
no
babies
up
this
stream
asked
the
lady
salmon
and
i
grew
so
lonely
i
thought
i
saw
three
last
night
but
they
were
gone
in
an
instant
down
to
the
sea
so
i
went
too
for
i
had
nothing
to
play
with
but
caddises
and
and
cried
the
lady
low
company
dear
if
he
has
been
in
low
company
he
has
certainly
not
learnt
their
low
manners
said
the
salmon
indeed
poor
little
dear
but
how
sad
for
him
to
live
among
such
people
as
caddises
who
have
actually
six
legs
the
nasty
things
and
too
why
they
are
not
even
good
to
eat
for
i
tried
them
once
and
they
are
all
hard
and
empty
and
as
for
trout
every
one
knows
what
they
whereon
she
curled
up
her
lip
and
looked
dreadfully
scornful
while
her
husband
curled
up
his
too
till
he
looked
as
proud
as
alcibiades
do
you
dislike
the
trout
so
asked
tom
dear
we
do
not
even
mention
them
if
we
can
help
it
for
i
am
sorry
to
say
they
are
relations
of
ours
who
do
us
no
credit
a
great
many
years
ago
they
were
just
like
us
but
they
were
so
lazy
and
cowardly
and
greedy
that
instead
of
going
down
to
the
sea
every
year
to
see
the
world
and
grow
strong
and
fat
they
chose
to
stay
and
poke
about
in
the
little
streams
and
eat
worms
and
grubs
and
they
are
very
properly
punished
for
it
for
they
have
grown
ugly
and
brown
and
spotted
and
small
and
are
actually
so
degraded
in
their
tastes
that
they
will
eat
our
then
they
pretend
to
scrape
acquaintance
with
us
again
said
the
lady
i
have
actually
known
one
of
them
propose
to
a
lady
salmon
the
little
impudent
little
picture
trout
and
salmon
should
hope
said
the
gentleman
there
are
very
few
ladies
of
our
race
who
would
degrade
themselves
by
listening
to
such
a
creature
for
an
instant
if
i
saw
such
a
thing
happen
i
should
consider
it
my
duty
to
put
them
both
to
death
upon
the
so
the
old
salmon
said
like
an
old
hidalgo
of
spain
and
what
is
more
he
would
have
done
it
too
for
you
must
know
no
enemies
are
so
bitter
against
each
other
as
those
who
are
of
the
same
race
and
a
salmon
looks
on
a
trout
as
some
great
folks
look
on
some
little
folks
as
something
just
too
much
like
himself
to
be
tolerated
chapter
iv
is
the
lore
which
nature
brings
our
meddling
intellect
the
beauteous
forms
of
things
we
murder
to
dissect
enough
of
science
and
of
art
close
up
these
barren
leaves
come
forth
and
bring
with
you
a
heart
that
watches
and
wordsworth
picture
tom
on
rock
so
the
salmon
went
up
after
tom
had
warned
them
of
the
wicked
old
otter
and
tom
went
down
but
slowly
and
cautiously
coasting
along
shore
he
was
many
days
about
it
for
it
was
many
miles
down
to
the
sea
and
perhaps
he
would
never
have
found
his
way
if
the
fairies
had
not
guided
him
without
his
seeing
their
fair
faces
or
feeling
their
gentle
hands
and
as
he
went
he
had
a
very
strange
adventure
it
was
a
clear
still
september
night
and
the
moon
shone
so
brightly
down
through
the
water
that
he
could
not
sleep
though
he
shut
his
eyes
as
tight
as
possible
so
at
last
he
came
up
to
the
top
and
sat
upon
a
little
point
of
rock
and
looked
up
at
the
broad
yellow
moon
and
wondered
what
she
was
and
thought
that
she
looked
at
him
and
he
watched
the
moonlight
on
the
rippling
river
and
the
black
heads
of
the
firs
and
the
lawns
and
listened
to
the
hoot
and
the
bleat
and
the
bark
and
the
laugh
and
smelt
the
soft
perfume
of
the
birches
and
the
wafts
of
heather
honey
off
the
grouse
moor
far
above
and
felt
very
happy
though
he
could
not
well
tell
why
you
of
course
would
have
been
very
cold
sitting
there
on
a
september
night
without
the
least
bit
of
clothes
on
your
wet
back
but
tom
was
a
and
therefore
felt
cold
no
more
than
a
fish
suddenly
he
saw
a
beautiful
sight
a
bright
red
light
moved
along
the
and
threw
down
into
the
water
a
long
of
flame
tom
curious
little
rogue
that
he
was
must
needs
go
and
see
what
it
was
so
he
swam
to
the
shore
and
met
the
light
as
it
stopped
over
a
shallow
run
at
the
edge
of
a
low
rock
and
there
underneath
the
light
lay
five
or
six
great
salmon
looking
up
at
the
flame
with
their
great
goggle
eyes
and
wagging
their
tails
as
if
they
were
very
much
pleased
at
it
tom
came
to
the
top
to
look
at
this
wonderful
light
nearer
and
made
a
splash
and
he
heard
a
voice
say
was
a
fish
he
did
not
know
what
the
words
meant
but
he
seemed
to
know
the
sound
of
them
and
to
know
the
voice
which
spoke
them
and
he
saw
on
the
bank
three
great
creatures
one
of
whom
held
the
light
flaring
and
sputtering
and
another
a
long
pole
and
he
knew
that
they
were
men
and
was
frightened
and
crept
into
a
hole
in
the
rock
from
which
he
could
see
what
went
on
the
man
with
the
torch
bent
down
over
the
water
and
looked
earnestly
in
and
then
he
said
that
muckle
fellow
lad
ower
fifteen
punds
and
haud
your
hand
tom
felt
that
there
was
some
danger
coming
and
longed
to
warn
the
foolish
salmon
who
kept
staring
up
at
the
light
as
if
he
was
bewitched
but
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
down
came
the
pole
through
the
water
there
was
a
fearful
splash
and
struggle
and
tom
saw
that
the
poor
salmon
was
speared
right
through
and
was
lifted
out
of
the
water
and
then
from
behind
there
sprang
on
these
three
men
three
other
men
and
there
were
shouts
and
blows
and
words
which
tom
recollected
to
have
heard
before
and
he
shuddered
and
turned
sick
at
them
now
for
he
felt
somehow
that
they
were
strange
and
ugly
and
wrong
and
horrible
and
it
all
began
to
come
back
to
him
they
were
men
and
they
were
fighting
savage
desperate
fighting
such
as
tom
had
seen
too
many
times
before
and
he
stopped
his
little
ears
and
longed
to
swim
away
and
was
very
glad
that
he
was
a
and
had
nothing
to
do
any
more
with
horrid
dirty
men
with
foul
clothes
on
their
backs
and
foul
words
on
their
lips
but
he
dared
not
stir
out
of
his
hole
while
the
rock
shook
over
his
head
with
the
trampling
and
struggling
of
the
keepers
and
the
poachers
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
tremendous
splash
and
a
frightful
flash
and
a
hissing
and
all
was
still
for
into
the
water
close
to
tom
fell
one
of
the
men
he
who
held
the
light
in
his
hand
into
the
swift
river
he
sank
and
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
current
tom
heard
the
men
above
run
along
seemingly
looking
for
him
but
he
drifted
down
into
the
deep
hole
below
and
there
lay
quite
still
and
they
could
not
find
him
tom
waited
a
long
time
till
all
was
quiet
and
then
he
peeped
out
and
saw
the
man
lying
at
last
he
screwed
up
his
courage
and
swam
down
to
him
he
thought
water
has
made
him
fall
asleep
as
it
did
then
he
went
nearer
he
grew
more
and
more
curious
he
could
not
tell
why
he
must
go
and
look
at
him
he
would
go
very
quietly
of
course
so
he
swam
round
and
round
him
closer
and
closer
and
as
he
did
not
stir
at
last
he
came
quite
close
and
looked
him
in
the
face
the
moon
shone
so
bright
that
tom
could
see
every
feature
and
as
he
saw
he
recollected
bit
by
bit
it
was
his
old
master
grimes
tom
turned
tail
and
swam
away
as
fast
as
he
could
dear
me
he
thought
he
will
turn
into
a
what
a
nasty
troublesome
one
he
will
be
and
perhaps
he
will
find
me
out
and
beat
me
so
he
went
up
the
river
again
a
little
way
and
lay
there
the
rest
of
the
night
under
an
alder
root
but
when
morning
came
he
longed
to
go
down
again
to
the
big
pool
and
see
whether
grimes
had
turned
into
a
yet
so
he
went
very
carefully
peeping
round
all
the
rocks
and
hiding
under
all
the
roots
grimes
lay
there
still
he
had
not
turned
into
a
in
the
afternoon
tom
went
back
again
he
could
not
rest
till
he
had
found
out
what
had
become
of
grimes
but
this
time
grimes
was
gone
and
tom
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
turned
into
a
he
might
have
made
himself
easy
poor
little
man
grimes
did
not
turn
into
a
or
anything
like
one
at
all
but
he
did
not
make
himself
easy
and
a
long
time
he
was
fearful
lest
he
should
meet
grimes
suddenly
in
some
deep
pool
he
could
not
know
that
the
fairies
had
carried
him
away
and
put
him
where
they
put
everything
which
falls
into
the
water
exactly
where
it
ought
to
be
but
do
you
know
what
had
happened
to
grimes
had
such
an
effect
on
him
that
he
never
poached
salmon
any
more
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
when
a
man
becomes
a
confirmed
poacher
the
only
way
to
cure
him
is
to
put
him
under
water
for
hours
like
grimes
so
when
you
grow
to
be
a
big
man
do
you
behave
as
all
honest
fellows
should
and
never
touch
a
fish
or
a
head
of
game
which
belongs
to
another
man
without
his
express
leave
and
then
people
will
call
you
a
gentleman
and
treat
you
like
one
and
perhaps
give
you
good
sport
instead
of
hitting
you
into
the
river
or
calling
you
a
poaching
snob
then
tom
went
on
down
for
he
was
afraid
of
staying
near
grimes
and
as
he
went
all
the
vale
looked
sad
the
red
and
yellow
leaves
showered
down
into
the
river
the
flies
and
beetles
were
all
dead
and
gone
the
chill
autumn
fog
lay
low
upon
the
hills
and
sometimes
spread
itself
so
thickly
on
the
river
that
he
could
not
see
his
way
but
he
felt
his
way
instead
following
the
flow
of
the
stream
day
after
day
past
great
bridges
past
boats
and
barges
past
the
great
town
with
its
wharfs
and
mills
and
tall
smoking
chimneys
and
ships
which
rode
at
anchor
in
the
stream
and
now
and
then
he
ran
against
their
hawsers
and
wondered
what
they
were
and
peeped
out
and
saw
the
sailors
lounging
on
board
smoking
their
pipes
and
ducked
under
again
for
he
was
terribly
afraid
of
being
caught
by
man
and
turned
into
a
once
more
he
did
not
know
that
the
fairies
were
close
to
him
always
shutting
the
eyes
lest
they
should
see
him
and
turning
him
aside
from
millraces
and
and
all
foul
and
dangerous
things
poor
little
fellow
it
was
a
dreary
journey
for
him
and
more
than
once
he
longed
to
be
back
in
vendale
playing
with
the
trout
in
the
bright
summer
sun
but
it
could
not
be
what
has
been
once
can
never
come
over
again
and
people
can
be
little
babies
even
only
once
in
their
lives
besides
people
who
make
up
their
minds
to
go
and
see
the
world
as
tom
did
must
needs
find
it
a
weary
journey
lucky
for
them
if
they
do
not
lose
heart
and
stop
instead
of
going
on
bravely
to
the
end
as
tom
did
for
then
they
will
remain
neither
boys
nor
men
neither
fish
flesh
nor
good
having
learnt
a
great
deal
too
much
and
yet
not
enough
and
sown
their
wild
oats
without
having
the
advantage
of
reaping
them
but
tom
was
always
a
brave
determined
little
english
who
never
knew
when
he
was
beaten
and
on
and
on
he
held
till
he
saw
a
long
way
off
the
red
buoy
through
the
fog
and
then
he
found
to
his
surprise
the
stream
turned
round
and
running
up
inland
it
was
the
tide
of
course
but
tom
knew
nothing
of
the
tide
he
only
knew
that
in
a
minute
more
the
water
which
had
been
fresh
turned
salt
all
round
him
and
then
there
came
a
change
over
him
he
felt
as
strong
and
light
and
fresh
as
if
his
veins
had
run
champagne
and
gave
he
did
not
know
why
three
skips
out
of
the
water
a
yard
high
and
head
over
heels
just
as
the
salmon
do
when
they
first
touch
the
noble
rich
salt
water
which
as
some
wise
men
tell
us
is
the
mother
of
all
living
things
picture
seal
he
did
not
care
now
for
the
tide
being
against
him
the
red
buoy
was
in
sight
dancing
in
the
open
sea
and
to
the
buoy
he
would
go
and
to
it
he
went
he
passed
great
shoals
of
bass
and
mullet
leaping
and
rushing
in
after
the
shrimps
but
he
never
heeded
them
or
they
him
and
once
he
passed
a
great
black
shining
seal
who
was
coming
in
after
the
mullet
the
seal
put
his
head
and
shoulders
out
of
water
and
stared
at
him
looking
exactly
like
a
fat
old
greasy
negro
with
a
gray
pate
and
tom
instead
of
being
frightened
said
do
sir
what
a
beautiful
place
the
sea
is
and
the
old
seal
instead
of
trying
to
bite
him
looked
at
him
with
his
soft
sleepy
winking
eyes
and
said
tide
to
you
my
little
man
are
you
looking
for
your
brothers
and
sisters
i
passed
them
all
at
play
then
said
tom
shall
have
playfellows
at
last
and
he
swam
on
to
the
buoy
and
got
upon
it
for
he
was
quite
out
of
breath
and
sat
there
and
looked
round
for
but
there
were
none
to
be
seen
picture
the
old
bouy
the
came
in
freshly
with
the
tide
and
blew
the
fog
away
and
the
little
waves
danced
for
joy
around
the
buoy
and
the
old
buoy
danced
with
them
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
ran
races
over
the
bright
blue
bay
and
yet
never
caught
each
other
up
and
the
breakers
plunged
merrily
upon
the
wide
white
sands
and
jumped
up
over
the
rocks
to
see
what
the
green
fields
inside
were
like
and
tumbled
down
and
broke
themselves
all
to
pieces
and
never
minded
it
a
bit
but
mended
themselves
and
jumped
up
again
and
the
terns
hovered
over
tom
like
huge
white
with
black
heads
and
the
gulls
laughed
like
girls
at
play
and
the
with
their
red
bills
and
legs
flew
to
and
fro
from
shore
to
shore
and
whistled
sweet
and
wild
and
tom
looked
and
looked
and
listened
and
he
would
have
been
very
happy
if
he
could
only
have
seen
the
then
when
the
tide
turned
he
left
the
buoy
and
swam
round
and
round
in
search
of
them
but
in
vain
sometimes
he
thought
he
heard
them
laughing
but
it
was
only
the
laughter
of
the
ripples
and
sometimes
he
thought
he
saw
them
at
the
bottom
but
it
was
only
white
and
pink
shells
and
once
he
was
sure
he
had
found
one
for
he
saw
two
bright
eyes
peeping
out
of
the
sand
so
he
dived
down
and
began
scraping
the
sand
away
and
cried
hide
i
do
want
some
one
to
play
with
so
much
and
out
jumped
a
great
turbot
with
his
ugly
eyes
and
mouth
all
awry
and
flopped
away
along
the
bottom
knocking
poor
tom
over
and
he
sat
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
cried
salt
tears
from
sheer
disappointment
to
have
come
all
this
way
and
faced
so
many
dangers
and
yet
to
find
no
how
hard
well
it
did
seem
hard
but
people
even
little
babies
can
not
have
all
they
want
without
waiting
for
it
and
working
for
it
too
my
little
man
as
you
will
find
out
some
day
and
tom
sat
upon
the
buoy
long
days
long
weeks
looking
out
to
sea
and
wondering
when
the
would
come
back
and
yet
they
never
came
picture
tom
and
a
then
he
began
to
ask
all
the
strange
things
which
came
in
out
of
the
sea
if
they
had
seen
any
and
some
said
and
some
said
nothing
at
all
he
asked
the
bass
and
the
pollock
but
they
were
so
greedy
after
the
shrimps
that
they
did
not
care
to
answer
him
a
word
then
there
came
in
a
whole
fleet
of
purple
floating
along
each
on
a
sponge
full
of
foam
and
tom
said
do
you
come
from
you
pretty
creatures
and
have
you
seen
the
and
the
answered
we
come
we
know
not
and
whither
we
are
going
who
can
tell
we
float
out
our
life
in
the
with
the
warm
sunshine
above
our
heads
and
the
warm
below
and
that
is
enough
for
us
yes
perhaps
we
have
seen
the
we
have
seen
many
strange
things
as
we
sailed
and
they
floated
away
the
happy
stupid
things
and
all
went
ashore
upon
the
sands
then
there
came
in
a
great
lazy
sunfish
as
big
as
a
fat
pig
cut
in
half
and
he
seemed
to
have
been
cut
in
half
too
and
squeezed
in
a
till
he
was
flat
but
to
all
his
big
body
and
big
fins
he
had
only
a
little
mouth
no
bigger
than
and
when
tom
questioned
him
he
answered
in
a
little
squeaky
feeble
voice
sure
i
know
lost
my
way
i
meant
to
go
to
the
chesapeake
and
afraid
got
wrong
somehow
dear
me
it
was
all
by
following
that
pleasant
warm
water
sure
lost
my
picture
sunfish
and
when
tom
asked
him
again
he
could
only
answer
lost
my
way
talk
to
me
i
want
to
but
like
a
good
many
other
people
the
more
he
tried
to
think
the
less
he
could
think
and
tom
saw
him
blundering
about
all
day
till
the
saw
his
big
fin
above
the
water
and
rowed
out
and
struck
a
into
him
and
took
him
away
they
took
him
up
to
the
town
and
showed
him
for
a
penny
a
head
and
made
a
good
work
of
it
but
of
course
tom
did
not
know
that
then
there
came
by
a
shoal
of
porpoises
rolling
as
they
and
mammas
and
little
all
quite
smooth
and
shiny
because
the
fairies
them
every
morning
and
they
sighed
so
softly
as
they
came
by
that
tom
took
courage
to
speak
to
them
but
all
they
answered
was
hush
hush
for
that
was
all
they
had
learnt
to
say
and
then
there
came
a
shoal
of
basking
some
of
them
as
long
as
a
boat
and
tom
was
frightened
at
them
but
they
were
very
lazy
fellows
not
greedy
tyrants
like
white
sharks
and
blue
sharks
and
ground
sharks
and
who
eat
men
or
and
threshers
and
who
hunt
the
poor
old
whales
they
came
and
rubbed
their
great
sides
against
the
buoy
and
lay
basking
in
the
sun
with
their
backfins
out
of
water
and
winked
at
tom
but
he
never
could
get
them
to
speak
they
had
eaten
so
many
herrings
that
they
were
quite
stupid
and
tom
was
glad
when
a
collier
brig
came
by
and
frightened
them
all
away
for
they
did
smell
most
horribly
certainly
and
he
had
to
hold
his
nose
tight
as
long
as
they
were
there
and
then
there
came
by
a
beautiful
creature
like
a
ribbon
of
pure
silver
with
a
sharp
head
and
very
long
teeth
but
it
seemed
very
sick
and
sad
sometimes
it
rolled
helpless
on
its
side
and
then
it
dashed
away
glittering
like
white
fire
and
then
it
lay
sick
again
and
motionless
do
you
come
from
asked
tom
why
are
so
sick
and
sad
come
from
the
warm
carolinas
and
the
sandbanks
fringed
with
pines
where
the
great
leap
and
flap
like
giant
bats
upon
the
tide
but
i
wandered
north
and
north
upon
the
treacherous
warm
till
i
met
with
the
cold
icebergs
afloat
in
the
mid
ocean
so
i
got
tangled
among
the
icebergs
and
chilled
with
their
frozen
breath
but
the
helped
me
from
among
them
and
set
me
free
again
and
now
i
am
mending
every
day
but
i
am
very
sick
and
sad
and
perhaps
i
shall
never
get
home
again
to
play
with
the
any
cried
tom
you
have
seen
have
you
seen
any
near
here
they
helped
me
again
last
night
or
i
should
have
been
eaten
by
a
great
black
how
vexatious
the
close
to
him
and
yet
he
could
not
find
one
and
then
he
left
the
buoy
and
used
to
go
along
the
sands
and
round
the
rocks
and
come
out
in
the
the
forsaken
merman
in
beautiful
beautiful
poem
which
you
must
learn
by
heart
some
sit
upon
a
point
of
rock
among
the
shining
in
the
low
october
tides
and
cry
and
call
for
the
but
he
never
heard
a
voice
call
in
return
and
at
last
with
his
fretting
and
crying
he
grew
quite
lean
and
thin
but
one
day
among
the
rocks
he
found
a
playfellow
it
was
not
a
alas
but
it
was
a
lobster
and
a
very
distinguished
lobster
he
was
for
he
had
live
barnacles
on
his
claws
which
is
a
great
mark
of
distinction
in
lobsterdom
and
no
more
to
be
bought
for
money
than
a
good
conscience
or
the
victoria
cross
picture
tom
and
the
lobster
tom
had
never
seen
a
lobster
before
and
he
was
mightily
taken
with
this
one
for
he
thought
him
the
most
curious
odd
ridiculous
creature
he
had
ever
seen
and
there
he
was
not
far
wrong
for
all
the
ingenious
men
and
all
the
scientific
men
and
all
the
fanciful
men
in
the
world
with
all
the
old
german
into
the
bargain
could
never
invent
if
all
their
wits
were
boiled
into
one
anything
so
curious
and
so
ridiculous
as
a
lobster
he
had
one
claw
knobbed
and
the
other
jagged
and
tom
delighted
in
watching
him
hold
on
to
the
seaweed
with
his
knobbed
claw
while
he
cut
up
salads
with
his
jagged
one
and
then
put
them
into
his
mouth
after
smelling
at
them
like
a
monkey
and
always
the
little
barnacles
threw
out
their
and
swept
the
water
and
came
in
for
their
share
of
whatever
there
was
for
dinner
but
tom
was
most
astonished
to
see
how
he
fired
himself
like
the
which
you
make
out
of
a
certainly
he
took
the
most
wonderful
shots
and
backwards
too
for
if
he
wanted
to
go
into
a
narrow
crack
ten
yards
off
what
do
you
think
he
did
if
he
had
gone
in
head
foremost
of
course
he
could
not
have
turned
round
so
he
used
to
turn
his
tail
to
it
and
lay
his
long
horns
which
carry
his
sixth
sense
in
their
tips
and
nobody
knows
what
that
sixth
sense
is
straight
down
his
back
to
guide
him
and
twist
his
eyes
back
till
they
almost
came
out
of
their
sockets
and
then
made
ready
present
fire
snap
away
he
went
pop
into
the
hole
and
peeped
out
and
twiddled
his
whiskers
as
much
as
to
say
do
tom
asked
him
about
he
said
he
had
seen
them
often
but
he
did
not
think
much
of
them
they
were
meddlesome
little
creatures
that
went
about
helping
fish
and
shells
which
got
into
scrapes
well
for
his
part
he
should
be
ashamed
to
be
helped
by
little
soft
creatures
that
had
not
even
a
shell
on
their
backs
he
had
lived
quite
long
enough
in
the
world
to
take
care
of
himself
he
was
a
conceited
fellow
the
old
lobster
and
not
very
civil
to
tom
and
you
will
hear
how
he
had
to
alter
his
mind
before
he
was
done
as
conceited
people
generally
have
but
he
was
so
funny
and
tom
so
lonely
that
he
could
not
quarrel
with
him
and
they
used
to
sit
in
holes
in
the
rocks
and
chat
for
hours
and
about
this
time
there
happened
to
tom
a
very
strange
and
important
important
indeed
that
he
was
very
near
never
finding
the
at
all
and
i
am
sure
you
would
have
been
sorry
for
that
i
hope
that
you
have
not
forgotten
the
little
white
lady
all
this
while
at
least
here
she
comes
looking
like
a
clean
white
good
little
darling
as
she
always
was
and
always
will
be
for
it
befell
in
the
pleasant
short
december
days
when
the
wind
always
blows
from
the
till
old
father
christmas
comes
and
spreads
the
great
white
ready
for
little
boys
and
girls
to
give
the
birds
their
christmas
dinner
of
befell
to
go
on
in
the
pleasant
december
days
that
sir
john
was
so
busy
hunting
that
nobody
at
home
could
get
a
word
out
of
him
four
days
a
week
he
hunted
and
very
good
sport
he
had
and
the
other
two
he
went
to
the
bench
and
the
board
of
guardians
and
very
good
justice
he
did
and
when
he
got
home
in
time
he
dined
at
five
for
he
hated
this
absurd
new
fashion
of
dining
at
eight
in
the
hunting
season
which
forces
a
man
to
make
interest
with
the
footman
for
cold
beef
and
beer
as
soon
as
he
comes
in
and
so
spoil
his
appetite
and
then
sleep
in
an
in
his
bedroom
all
stiff
and
tired
for
two
or
three
hours
before
he
can
get
his
dinner
like
a
gentleman
and
do
you
be
like
sir
john
my
dear
little
man
when
you
are
your
own
master
and
if
you
want
either
to
read
hard
or
ride
hard
stick
to
the
good
old
cambridge
hours
of
breakfast
at
eight
and
dinner
at
five
by
which
you
may
get
two
work
out
of
one
but
of
course
if
you
find
a
fox
at
three
in
the
afternoon
and
run
him
till
dark
and
leave
off
twenty
miles
from
home
why
you
must
wait
for
your
dinner
till
you
can
get
it
as
better
men
than
you
have
done
only
see
that
if
you
go
hungry
your
horse
does
not
but
give
him
his
warm
gruel
and
beer
and
take
him
gently
home
remembering
that
good
horses
grow
on
the
hedge
like
blackberries
it
befell
to
go
on
a
second
time
that
sir
john
hunting
all
day
and
dining
at
five
fell
asleep
every
evening
and
snored
so
terribly
that
all
the
windows
in
harthover
shook
and
the
soot
fell
down
the
chimneys
whereon
my
lady
being
no
more
able
to
get
conversation
out
of
him
than
a
song
out
of
a
dead
nightingale
determined
to
go
off
and
leave
him
and
the
doctor
and
captain
swinger
the
agent
to
snore
in
concert
every
evening
to
their
content
so
she
started
for
the
seaside
with
all
the
children
in
order
to
put
herself
and
them
into
condition
by
mild
applications
of
iodine
she
might
as
well
have
stayed
at
home
and
used
liquid
for
there
was
plenty
of
it
in
the
stables
and
then
she
would
have
saved
her
money
and
saved
the
chance
also
of
making
all
the
children
ill
instead
of
well
as
hundreds
are
made
by
taking
them
to
some
nasty
smelling
undrained
lodging
and
then
wondering
how
they
caught
scarlatina
and
diphtheria
but
people
be
wise
enough
to
understand
that
till
they
are
dead
of
bad
smells
and
then
it
will
be
too
late
besides
you
see
sir
john
did
certainly
snore
very
loud
picture
sir
john
with
horse
and
groom
but
where
she
went
to
nobody
must
know
for
fear
young
ladies
should
begin
to
fancy
that
there
are
there
and
so
hunt
and
howk
after
them
besides
raising
the
price
of
lodgings
and
keep
them
in
aquariums
as
the
ladies
at
pompeii
as
you
may
see
by
the
paintings
used
to
keep
cupids
in
cages
but
nobody
ever
heard
that
they
starved
the
cupids
or
let
them
die
of
dirt
and
neglect
as
english
young
ladies
do
by
the
poor
so
nobody
must
know
where
my
lady
went
letting
die
is
as
bad
as
taking
singing
eggs
for
though
there
are
thousands
ay
millions
of
both
of
them
in
the
world
yet
there
is
not
one
too
many
now
it
befell
that
on
the
very
shore
and
over
the
very
rocks
where
tom
was
sitting
with
his
friend
the
lobster
there
walked
one
day
the
little
white
lady
ellie
herself
and
with
her
a
very
wise
man
ptthmllnsprts
his
mother
was
a
dutchwoman
and
therefore
he
was
born
at
curaçao
of
course
you
have
learnt
your
geography
and
therefore
know
why
and
his
father
a
pole
and
therefore
he
was
brought
up
at
petropaulowski
of
course
you
have
learnt
your
modern
politics
and
therefore
know
why
but
for
all
that
he
was
as
thorough
an
englishman
as
ever
coveted
his
goods
and
his
name
as
i
said
was
professor
ptthmllnsprts
which
is
a
very
ancient
and
noble
polish
name
he
was
as
i
said
a
very
great
naturalist
and
chief
professor
of
in
the
new
university
which
the
king
of
the
cannibal
islands
had
founded
and
being
a
member
of
the
acclimatisation
society
he
had
come
here
to
collect
all
the
nasty
things
which
he
could
find
on
the
coast
of
england
and
turn
them
loose
round
the
cannibal
islands
because
they
had
not
nasty
things
enough
there
to
eat
what
they
left
picture
the
professor
but
he
was
a
very
worthy
kind
little
old
gentleman
and
very
fond
of
children
for
he
was
not
the
least
a
cannibal
himself
and
very
good
to
all
the
world
as
long
as
it
was
good
to
him
only
one
fault
he
had
which
have
likewise
as
you
may
see
if
you
look
out
of
the
nursery
when
any
one
else
found
a
curious
worm
he
would
hop
round
them
and
peck
them
and
set
up
his
tail
and
bristle
up
his
feathers
just
as
a
would
and
declare
that
he
found
the
worm
first
and
that
it
was
his
worm
and
if
not
that
then
it
was
not
a
worm
at
all
he
had
met
sir
john
at
scarborough
or
fleetwood
or
somewhere
or
other
if
you
care
where
nobody
else
does
and
had
made
acquaintance
with
him
and
become
very
fond
of
his
children
now
sir
john
knew
nothing
about
and
cared
less
provided
the
fishmonger
sent
him
good
fish
for
dinner
and
my
lady
knew
as
little
but
she
thought
it
proper
that
the
children
should
know
something
for
in
the
stupid
old
times
you
must
understand
children
were
taught
to
know
one
thing
and
to
know
it
well
but
in
these
enlightened
new
times
they
are
taught
to
know
a
little
about
everything
and
to
know
it
all
ill
which
is
a
great
deal
pleasanter
and
easier
and
therefore
quite
right
so
ellie
and
he
were
walking
on
the
rocks
and
he
was
showing
her
about
one
in
ten
thousand
of
all
the
beautiful
and
curious
things
which
are
to
be
seen
there
but
little
ellie
was
not
satisfied
with
them
at
all
she
liked
much
better
to
play
with
live
children
or
even
with
dolls
which
she
could
pretend
were
alive
and
at
last
she
said
honestly
care
about
all
these
things
because
they
play
with
me
or
talk
to
me
if
there
were
little
children
now
in
the
water
as
there
used
to
be
and
i
could
see
them
i
should
like
picture
ellie
in
the
water
you
strange
little
duck
said
the
professor
said
ellie
know
there
used
to
be
children
in
the
water
and
mermaids
too
and
mermen
i
saw
them
all
in
a
picture
at
home
of
a
beautiful
lady
sailing
in
a
car
drawn
by
dolphins
and
babies
flying
round
her
and
one
sitting
in
her
lap
and
the
mermaids
swimming
and
playing
and
the
mermen
trumpeting
on
and
it
is
called
triumph
of
galatea
and
there
is
a
burning
mountain
in
the
picture
behind
it
hangs
on
the
great
staircase
and
i
have
looked
at
it
ever
since
i
was
a
baby
and
dreamt
about
it
a
hundred
times
and
it
is
so
beautiful
that
it
must
be
but
the
professor
had
not
the
least
notion
of
allowing
that
things
were
true
merely
because
people
thought
them
beautiful
for
at
that
rate
he
said
the
baltas
would
be
quite
right
in
thinking
it
a
fine
thing
to
eat
their
grandpapas
because
they
thought
it
an
ugly
thing
to
put
them
underground
the
professor
indeed
went
further
and
held
that
no
man
was
forced
to
believe
anything
to
be
true
but
what
he
could
see
hear
taste
or
handle
he
held
very
strange
theories
about
a
good
many
things
he
had
even
got
up
once
at
the
british
association
and
declared
that
apes
had
hippopotamus
majors
in
their
brains
just
as
men
have
which
was
a
shocking
thing
to
say
for
if
it
were
so
what
would
become
of
the
faith
hope
and
charity
of
immortal
millions
you
may
think
that
there
are
other
more
important
differences
between
you
and
an
ape
such
as
being
able
to
speak
and
make
machines
and
know
right
from
wrong
and
say
your
prayers
and
other
little
matters
of
that
kind
but
that
is
a
fancy
my
dear
nothing
is
to
be
depended
on
but
the
great
hippopotamus
test
if
you
have
a
hippopotamus
major
in
your
brain
you
are
no
ape
though
you
had
four
hands
no
feet
and
were
more
apish
than
the
apes
of
all
aperies
but
if
a
hippopotamus
major
is
ever
discovered
in
one
single
brain
nothing
will
save
your
from
having
been
an
ape
too
no
my
dear
little
man
always
remember
that
the
one
true
certain
final
and
difference
between
you
and
an
ape
is
that
you
have
a
hippopotamus
major
in
your
brain
and
it
has
none
and
that
therefore
to
discover
one
in
its
brain
will
be
a
very
wrong
and
dangerous
thing
at
which
every
one
will
be
very
much
shocked
as
we
may
suppose
they
were
at
the
really
after
all
it
much
matter
lord
dundreary
and
others
would
put
but
men
have
hippopotamuses
in
their
brains
so
if
a
hippopotamus
was
discovered
in
an
brain
why
it
would
not
be
one
you
know
but
something
else
but
the
professor
had
gone
i
am
sorry
to
say
even
further
than
that
for
he
had
read
at
the
british
association
at
melbourne
australia
in
the
year
a
paper
which
assured
every
one
who
found
himself
the
better
or
wiser
for
the
news
that
there
were
not
never
had
been
and
could
not
be
any
rational
or
beings
except
men
anywhere
anywhen
or
anyhow
that
or
worse
were
nothing
at
all
and
pure
bosh
and
wind
and
he
had
to
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
to
prove
that
and
to
eat
his
breakfast
overnight
but
he
did
it
at
least
to
his
own
satisfaction
whereon
a
certain
great
divine
and
a
very
clever
divine
was
he
called
him
a
regular
sadducee
and
probably
he
was
quite
right
whereon
the
professor
in
return
called
him
a
regular
pharisee
and
probably
he
was
quite
right
too
but
they
did
not
quarrel
in
the
least
for
when
men
are
men
of
the
world
hard
words
run
off
them
like
water
off
a
back
so
the
professor
and
the
divine
met
at
dinner
that
evening
and
sat
together
on
the
sofa
afterwards
for
an
hour
and
talked
over
the
state
of
female
labour
on
the
antarctic
continent
for
nobody
talks
shop
after
his
claret
and
each
vowed
that
the
other
was
the
best
company
he
ever
met
in
his
life
what
an
advantage
it
is
to
be
men
of
the
world
from
all
which
you
may
guess
that
the
professor
was
not
the
least
of
little
opinion
so
he
gave
her
a
succinct
compendium
of
his
famous
paper
at
the
british
association
in
a
form
suited
for
the
youthful
mind
but
as
we
have
gone
over
his
arguments
against
once
already
which
is
once
too
often
we
will
not
repeat
them
here
now
little
ellie
was
i
suppose
a
stupid
little
girl
for
instead
of
being
convinced
by
professor
arguments
she
only
asked
the
same
question
over
again
why
are
there
not
i
trust
and
hope
that
it
was
because
the
professor
trod
at
that
moment
on
the
edge
of
a
very
sharp
mussel
and
hurt
one
of
his
corns
sadly
that
he
answered
quite
sharply
forgetting
that
he
was
a
scientific
man
and
therefore
ought
to
have
known
that
he
know
and
that
he
was
a
logician
and
therefore
ought
to
have
known
that
he
could
not
prove
a
universal
say
i
trust
and
hope
it
was
because
the
mussel
hurt
his
corn
that
the
professor
answered
quite
sharply
there
which
was
not
even
good
english
my
dear
little
boy
for
as
you
must
know
from
aunt
arguments
the
professor
ought
to
have
said
if
he
was
so
angry
as
to
say
anything
of
the
there
are
not
or
are
none
or
are
none
of
them
or
if
he
had
been
reading
aunt
agitate
too
because
they
do
not
exist
and
he
groped
with
his
net
under
the
weeds
so
violently
that
as
it
befell
he
caught
poor
little
tom
he
felt
the
net
very
heavy
and
lifted
it
out
quickly
with
tom
all
entangled
in
the
meshes
me
he
cried
a
large
pink
holothurian
with
hands
too
it
must
be
connected
with
and
he
took
him
out
has
actually
eyes
he
cried
it
must
be
a
cephalopod
this
is
most
extraordinary
i
cried
tom
as
loud
as
he
could
for
he
did
not
like
to
be
called
bad
names
is
a
cried
ellie
and
of
course
it
was
my
dear
said
the
professor
and
he
turned
away
sharply
there
was
no
denying
it
it
was
a
and
he
had
said
a
moment
ago
that
there
were
none
what
was
he
to
do
he
would
have
liked
of
course
to
have
taken
tom
home
in
a
bucket
he
would
not
have
put
him
in
spirits
of
course
not
he
would
have
kept
him
alive
and
petted
him
for
he
was
a
very
kind
old
gentleman
and
written
a
book
about
him
and
given
him
two
long
names
of
which
the
first
would
have
said
a
little
about
tom
and
the
second
all
about
himself
for
of
course
he
would
have
called
him
hydrotecnon
ptthmllnsprtsianum
or
some
other
long
name
like
that
for
they
are
forced
to
call
everything
by
long
names
now
because
they
have
used
up
all
the
short
ones
ever
since
they
took
to
making
nine
species
out
of
one
would
all
the
learned
men
say
to
him
after
his
speech
at
the
british
association
and
what
would
ellie
say
after
what
he
had
just
told
her
there
was
a
wise
old
heathen
once
who
said
debetur
pueris
greatest
reverence
is
due
to
children
that
is
that
grown
people
should
never
say
or
do
anything
wrong
before
children
lest
they
should
set
them
a
bad
cramchild
says
it
means
greatest
respectfulness
is
expected
from
little
but
he
was
raised
in
a
country
where
little
boys
are
not
expected
to
be
respectful
because
all
of
them
are
as
good
as
the
president
every
one
knows
his
own
concerns
best
so
perhaps
they
are
but
poor
cousin
cramchild
to
do
him
justice
not
being
of
that
opinion
and
having
a
moral
mission
and
being
no
scholar
to
speak
of
and
hard
up
for
an
it
was
a
very
great
temptation
for
him
but
some
people
and
i
am
afraid
the
professor
was
one
of
them
interpret
that
in
a
more
strange
curious
fashion
than
even
cousin
cramchild
for
they
make
it
mean
that
you
must
show
your
respect
for
children
by
never
confessing
yourself
in
the
wrong
to
them
even
if
you
know
that
you
are
so
lest
they
should
lose
confidence
in
their
elders
now
if
the
professor
had
said
to
ellie
my
darling
it
is
a
and
a
very
wonderful
thing
it
is
and
it
shows
how
little
i
know
of
the
wonders
of
nature
in
spite
of
forty
honest
labour
i
was
just
telling
you
that
there
could
be
no
such
creatures
and
behold
here
is
one
come
to
confound
my
conceit
and
show
me
that
nature
can
do
and
has
done
beyond
all
that
poor
fancy
can
imagine
so
let
us
thank
the
maker
and
inspirer
and
lord
of
nature
for
all
his
wonderful
and
glorious
works
and
try
and
find
out
something
about
this
one
think
that
if
the
professor
had
said
that
little
ellie
would
have
believed
him
more
firmly
and
respected
him
more
deeply
and
loved
him
better
than
ever
she
had
done
before
but
he
was
of
a
different
opinion
he
hesitated
a
moment
he
longed
to
keep
tom
and
yet
he
half
wished
he
never
had
caught
him
and
at
last
he
quite
longed
to
get
rid
of
him
so
he
turned
away
and
poked
tom
with
his
finger
for
want
of
anything
better
to
do
and
said
carelessly
dear
little
maid
you
must
have
dreamt
of
last
night
your
head
is
so
full
of
now
tom
had
been
in
the
most
horrible
and
unspeakable
fright
all
the
while
and
had
kept
as
quiet
as
he
could
though
he
was
called
a
holothurian
and
a
cephalopod
for
it
was
fixed
in
his
little
head
that
if
a
man
with
clothes
on
caught
him
he
might
put
clothes
on
him
too
and
make
a
dirty
black
of
him
again
but
when
the
professor
poked
him
it
was
more
than
he
could
bear
and
between
fright
and
rage
he
turned
to
bay
as
valiantly
as
a
mouse
in
a
corner
and
bit
the
finger
till
it
bled
ah
yah
cried
he
and
glad
of
an
excuse
to
be
rid
of
tom
dropped
him
on
to
the
seaweed
and
thence
he
dived
into
the
water
and
was
gone
in
a
moment
it
was
a
and
i
heard
it
speak
cried
ellie
it
is
gone
and
she
jumped
down
off
the
rock
to
try
and
catch
tom
before
he
slipped
into
the
sea
picture
ellie
the
professor
and
tom
too
late
and
what
was
worse
as
she
sprang
down
she
slipped
and
fell
some
six
feet
with
her
head
on
a
sharp
rock
and
lay
quite
still
the
professor
picked
her
up
and
tried
to
waken
her
and
called
to
her
and
cried
over
her
for
he
loved
her
very
much
but
she
would
not
waken
at
all
so
he
took
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
her
governess
and
they
all
went
home
and
little
ellie
was
put
to
bed
and
lay
there
quite
still
only
now
and
then
she
woke
up
and
called
out
about
the
but
no
one
knew
what
she
meant
and
the
professor
did
not
tell
for
he
was
ashamed
to
tell
and
after
a
week
one
moonlight
night
the
fairies
came
flying
in
at
the
window
and
brought
her
such
a
pretty
pair
of
wings
that
she
could
not
help
putting
them
on
and
she
flew
with
them
out
of
the
window
and
over
the
land
and
over
the
sea
and
up
through
the
clouds
and
nobody
heard
or
saw
anything
of
her
for
a
very
long
while
and
this
is
why
they
say
that
no
one
has
ever
yet
seen
a
for
my
part
i
believe
that
the
naturalists
get
dozens
of
them
when
they
are
out
dredging
but
they
say
nothing
about
them
and
throw
them
overboard
again
for
fear
of
spoiling
their
theories
but
you
see
the
professor
was
found
out
as
every
one
is
in
due
time
a
very
terrible
old
fairy
found
the
professor
out
she
felt
his
bumps
and
cast
his
nativity
and
took
the
lunars
of
him
carefully
inside
and
out
and
so
she
knew
what
he
would
do
as
well
as
if
she
had
seen
it
in
a
print
book
as
they
say
in
the
dear
old
west
country
and
he
did
it
and
so
he
was
found
out
beforehand
as
everybody
always
is
and
the
old
fairy
will
find
out
the
naturalists
some
day
and
put
them
in
the
and
then
on
whose
side
will
the
laugh
be
so
the
old
fairy
took
him
in
hand
very
severely
there
and
then
but
she
says
she
is
always
most
severe
with
the
best
people
because
there
is
most
chance
of
curing
them
and
therefore
they
are
the
patients
who
pay
her
best
for
she
has
to
work
on
the
same
salary
as
the
emperor
of
physicians
it
is
a
pity
that
all
do
not
no
cure
no
pay
so
she
took
the
poor
professor
in
hand
and
because
he
was
not
content
with
things
as
they
are
she
filled
his
head
with
things
as
they
are
not
to
try
if
he
would
like
them
better
and
because
he
did
not
choose
to
believe
in
a
when
he
saw
it
she
made
him
believe
in
worse
things
than
and
other
pleasant
creatures
which
folks
think
never
existed
yet
and
which
folks
hope
never
will
exist
though
they
know
nothing
about
the
matter
and
never
will
and
these
creatures
so
upset
terrified
flustered
aggravated
confused
astounded
horrified
and
totally
flabbergasted
the
poor
professor
that
the
doctors
said
that
he
was
out
of
his
wits
for
three
months
and
perhaps
they
were
right
as
they
are
now
and
then
so
all
the
doctors
in
the
county
were
called
in
to
make
a
report
on
his
case
and
of
course
every
one
of
them
flatly
contradicted
the
other
else
what
use
is
there
in
being
men
of
science
but
at
last
the
majority
agreed
on
a
report
in
the
true
medical
language
one
half
bad
latin
the
other
half
worse
greek
and
the
rest
what
might
have
been
english
if
they
had
only
learnt
to
write
it
and
this
is
the
beginning
subanhypaposupernal
anastomoses
of
peritomic
diacellurite
in
the
encephalo
digital
region
of
the
distinguished
individual
of
whose
symptomatic
phœnomena
we
had
the
melancholy
to
a
preliminary
diagnostic
making
an
inspectorial
the
interexclusively
quadrilateral
and
antinomian
diathesis
known
as
blue
but
what
they
proceeded
to
do
my
lady
never
knew
for
she
was
so
frightened
at
the
long
words
that
she
ran
for
her
life
and
locked
herself
into
her
bedroom
for
fear
of
being
squashed
by
the
words
and
strangled
by
the
sentence
a
boa
constrictor
she
said
was
bad
company
enough
but
what
was
a
boa
constrictor
made
of
paving
stones
was
quite
shocking
what
can
they
think
is
the
matter
with
him
said
she
to
the
old
nurse
his
just
addled
may
be
unbelief
and
heathenry
quoth
she
why
they
say
so
and
the
heaven
and
the
sea
and
the
rocks
and
the
vales
indeed
but
the
doctors
never
heard
them
so
she
made
sir
john
write
to
the
to
command
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
for
the
time
being
to
put
a
tax
on
long
words
a
light
tax
on
words
over
three
syllables
which
are
necessary
evils
like
rats
but
like
them
must
be
kept
down
judiciously
a
heavy
tax
on
words
over
four
syllables
as
and
on
words
over
five
syllables
of
which
i
hope
no
one
will
wish
to
see
any
examples
a
totally
prohibitory
tax
and
a
similar
prohibitory
tax
on
words
derived
from
three
or
more
languages
at
once
words
derived
from
two
languages
having
become
so
common
that
there
was
no
more
hope
of
rooting
out
them
than
of
rooting
out
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
being
a
scholar
and
a
man
of
sense
jumped
at
the
notion
for
he
saw
in
it
the
one
and
only
plan
for
abolishing
schedule
d
but
when
he
brought
in
his
bill
most
of
the
irish
members
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
some
of
the
scotch
likewise
opposed
it
most
strongly
on
the
ground
that
in
a
free
country
no
man
was
bound
either
to
understand
himself
or
to
let
others
understand
him
so
the
bill
fell
through
on
the
first
reading
and
the
chancellor
being
a
philosopher
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
a
woman
had
hit
off
a
grand
idea
and
the
men
turned
up
their
stupid
noses
thereat
now
the

had
it
all
their
own
way
and
to
work
they
went
in

they
gave
the
poor
professor
divers
and
sundry
medicines
as
prescribed
by
the
ancients
and
moderns
from
hippocrates
to
feuchtersleben

they
found
that
a
great
deal
too
much
trouble
as
most
people
have
since
and
so
had
recourse
boring
a
hole
in
his
head
to
let
out
fumes
which
says
gordonius
without
doubt
do
much
but
it

boiled

all

and
of
course
they
did
not
try
to
find
one
because
they
did
not
believe
in
them
and
were
thinking
of
nothing
but
blue
follicles
having
as
usual
set
the
cart
before
the
horse
and
taken
the
effect
for
the
cause
so
they
were
forced
at
last
to
let
the
poor
professor
ease
his
mind
by
writing
a
great
book
exactly
contrary
to
all
his
old
opinions
in
which
he
proved
that
the
moon
was
made
of
green
cheese
and
that
all
the
mites
in
it
which
you
may
see
sometimes
quite
plain
through
a
telescope
if
you
will
only
keep
the
lens
dirty
enough
as
weekes
kept
his
voltaic
battery
are
nothing
in
the
world
but
little
babies
who
are
hatching
and
swarming
up
there
in
millions
ready
to
come
down
into
this
world
whenever
children
want
a
new
little
brother
or
sister
which
must
be
a
mistake
for
this
one
reason
that
there
being
no
atmosphere
round
the
moon
though
some
one
or
other
says
there
is
at
least
on
the
other
side
and
that
he
has
been
round
at
the
back
of
it
to
see
and
found
that
the
moon
was
just
the
shape
of
a
bath
bun
and
so
wet
that
the
man
in
the
moon
went
about
on
in
macintoshes
and
boots
spearing
eels
and
sneezing
that
therefore
i
say
there
being
no
atmosphere
there
can
be
no
evaporation
and
therefore
the
can
never
fall
below
below
zero
of
fahrenheit
and
therefore
it
can
not
be
cold
enough
there
about
four
in
the
morning
to
condense
the
mesenteric
apophthegms
into
their
left
ventricles
and
therefore
they
can
never
catch
the
and
if
they
do
not
have
they
can
not
be
babies
at
all
and
therefore
there
are
no
babies
in
the
picture
man
in
rain
which
may
seem
a
roundabout
reason
and
so
perhaps
it
is
but
you
will
have
heard
worse
ones
in
your
time
and
from
better
men
than
you
are
but
one
thing
is
certain
that
when
the
good
old
doctor
got
his
book
written
he
felt
considerably
relieved
from
blue
follicles
and
a
few
things
infinitely
worse
to
wit
from
pride
and
and
from
blindness
and
hardness
of
heart
which
are
the
true
causes
of
blue
follicles
and
of
a
good
many
other
ugly
things
besides
whereon
the
foul
in
his
brains
ran
down
and
cleared
to
a
fine
coffee
colour
such
as
fish
like
to
rise
in
till
very
fine
clean
fish
did
begin
to
rise
in
his
brains
and
he
caught
two
or
three
of
them
which
is
exceedingly
fine
sport
for
brain
rivers
and
anatomised
them
carefully
and
never
mentioned
what
he
found
out
from
them
except
to
little
children
and
became
ever
after
a
sadder
and
a
wiser
man
which
is
a
very
good
thing
to
become
my
dear
little
boy
even
though
one
has
to
pay
a
heavy
price
for
the
blessing
picture
bat
with
face
chapter
v
lawgiver
yet
thou
dost
wear
the
most
benignant
grace
nor
know
we
anything
so
fair
as
is
the
smile
upon
thy
face
flowers
laugh
before
thee
on
their
beds
and
fragrance
in
thy
footing
treads
thou
dost
preserve
the
stars
from

and
the
most
ancient
heavens
through
thee
are
fresh
and
wordsworth
to
picture
dog
and
cat
but
what
became
of
little
tom
he
slipped
away
off
the
rocks
into
the
water
as
i
said
before
but
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
little
ellie
he
did
not
remember
who
she
was
but
he
knew
that
she
was
a
little
girl
though
she
was
a
hundred
times
as
big
as
he
that
is
not
surprising
size
has
nothing
to
do
with
kindred
a
tiny
weed
may
be
first
cousin
to
a
great
tree
and
a
little
dog
like
vick
knows
that
lioness
is
a
dog
too
though
she
is
twenty
times
larger
than
herself
so
tom
knew
that
ellie
was
a
little
girl
and
thought
about
her
all
that
day
and
longed
to
have
had
her
to
play
with
but
he
had
very
soon
to
think
of
something
else
and
here
is
the
account
of
what
happened
to
him
as
it
was
published
next
morning
in
the
gazette
on
the
finest
watered
paper
for
the
use
of
the
great
fairy
bedonebyasyoudid
who
reads
the
news
very
carefully
every
morning
and
especially
the
police
cases
as
you
will
hear
very
soon
he
was
going
along
the
rocks
in
water
watching
the
pollock
catch
prawns
and
the
wrasses
nibble
barnacles
off
the
rocks
shells
and
all
when
he
saw
a
round
cage
of
green
withes
and
inside
it
looking
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
sat
his
friend
the
lobster
twiddling
his
horns
instead
of
thumbs
picture
tom
the
lobster
and
otter
have
you
been
naughty
and
have
they
put
you
in
the
asked
tom
the
lobster
felt
a
little
indignant
at
such
a
notion
but
he
was
too
much
depressed
in
spirits
to
argue
so
he
only
said
get
did
you
get
in
that
nasty
piece
of
dead
he
had
thought
it
looked
and
smelt
very
nice
when
he
was
outside
and
so
it
did
for
a
lobster
but
now
he
turned
round
and
abused
it
because
he
was
angry
with
himself
did
you
get
in
that
round
hole
at
the
why
you
get
out
through
it
i
and
the
lobster
twiddled
his
horns
more
fiercely
than
ever
but
he
was
forced
to
confess
have
jumped
upwards
downwards
backwards
and
sideways
at
least
four
thousand
times
and
i
get
out
i
always
get
up
underneath
there
and
find
the
tom
looked
at
the
trap
and
having
more
wit
than
the
lobster
he
saw
plainly
enough
what
was
the
matter
as
you
may
if
you
will
look
at
a
a
bit
said
tom
your
tail
up
to
me
and
pull
you
through
hindforemost
and
then
you
stick
in
the
but
the
lobster
was
so
stupid
and
clumsy
that
he
hit
the
hole
like
a
great
many
he
was
very
sharp
as
long
as
he
was
in
his
own
country
but
as
soon
as
they
get
out
of
it
they
lose
their
heads
and
so
the
lobster
so
to
speak
lost
his
tail
tom
reached
and
clawed
down
the
hole
after
him
till
he
caught
hold
of
him
and
then
as
was
to
be
expected
the
clumsy
lobster
pulled
him
in
head
foremost
here
is
a
pretty
business
said
tom
take
your
great
claws
and
break
the
points
off
those
spikes
and
then
we
shall
both
get
out
me
i
never
thought
of
that
said
the
lobster
after
all
the
experience
of
life
that
i
have
had
you
see
experience
is
of
very
little
good
unless
a
man
or
a
lobster
has
wit
enough
to
make
use
of
it
for
a
good
many
people
like
old
polonius
have
seen
all
the
world
and
yet
remain
little
better
than
children
after
all
but
they
had
not
got
half
the
spikes
away
when
they
saw
a
great
dark
cloud
over
them
and
lo
and
behold
it
was
the
otter
how
she
did
grin
and
grin
when
she
saw
tom
said
she
little
meddlesome
wretch
i
have
you
now
i
will
serve
you
out
for
telling
the
salmon
where
i
was
and
she
crawled
all
over
the
pot
to
get
in
tom
was
horribly
frightened
and
still
more
frightened
when
she
found
the
hole
in
the
top
and
squeezed
herself
right
down
through
it
all
eyes
and
teeth
but
no
sooner
was
her
head
inside
than
valiant
mr
lobster
caught
her
by
the
nose
and
held
on
and
there
they
were
all
three
in
the
pot
rolling
over
and
over
and
very
tight
packing
it
was
and
the
lobster
tore
at
the
otter
and
the
otter
tore
at
the
lobster
and
both
squeezed
and
thumped
poor
tom
till
he
had
no
breath
left
in
his
body
and
i
know
what
would
have
happened
to
him
if
he
had
not
at
last
got
on
the
back
and
safe
out
of
the
hole
he
was
right
glad
when
he
got
out
but
he
would
not
desert
his
friend
who
had
saved
him
and
the
first
time
he
saw
his
tail
uppermost
he
caught
hold
of
it
and
pulled
with
all
his
might
but
the
lobster
would
not
let
go
along
said
tom
you
see
she
is
dead
and
so
she
was
quite
drowned
and
dead
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
wicked
otter
but
the
lobster
would
not
let
go
along
you
stupid
old
cried
tom
the
fisherman
will
catch
you
and
that
was
true
for
tom
felt
some
one
above
beginning
to
haul
up
the
pot
picture
tom
and
the
lobster
but
the
lobster
would
not
let
go
tom
saw
the
fisherman
haul
him
up
to
the
and
thought
it
was
all
up
with
him
but
when
mr
lobster
saw
the
fisherman
he
gave
such
a
furious
and
tremendous
snap
that
he
snapped
out
of
his
hand
and
out
of
the
pot
and
safe
into
the
sea
but
he
left
his
knobbed
claw
behind
him
for
it
never
came
into
his
stupid
head
to
let
go
after
all
so
he
just
shook
his
claw
off
as
the
easier
method
it
was
something
of
a
bull
that
but
you
must
know
the
lobster
was
an
irish
lobster
and
was
hatched
off
island
magee
at
the
mouth
of
belfast
lough
tom
asked
the
lobster
why
he
never
thought
of
letting
go
he
said
very
determinedly
that
it
was
a
point
of
honour
among
lobsters
and
so
it
is
as
the
mayor
of
plymouth
found
out
once
to
his
or
nine
hundred
years
ago
of
course
for
if
it
had
happened
lately
it
would
be
personal
to
mention
it
for
one
day
he
was
so
tired
with
sitting
on
a
hard
chair
in
a
grand
furred
gown
with
a
gold
chain
round
his
neck
hearing
one
policeman
after
another
come
in
and
sing
shall
we
do
with
the
drunken
sailor
so
early
in
the
morning
and
answering
them
each
exactly
alike
him
in
the
round
house
till
he
gets
sober
so
early
in
the
that
when
it
was
over
he
jumped
up
and
played
with
the
till
he
burst
his
buttons
and
then
had
his
luncheon
and
burst
some
more
buttons
and
then
said
is
a
low
i
shall
go
out
this
afternoon
and
cut
my
now
he
did
not
mean
to
cut
such
capers
as
you
eat
with
boiled
mutton
it
was
the
commandant
of
artillery
at
valetta
who
used
to
amuse
himself
with
cutting
them
and
who
stuck
upon
one
of
the
bastions
a
notice
one
allowed
to
cut
capers
here
but
me
which
greatly
edified
the
midshipmen
in
port
and
the
maltese
on
the
nix
mangiare
stairs
but
all
that
the
mayor
meant
was
that
he
would
go
and
have
an
fun
like
any
schoolboy
and
catch
lobsters
with
an
iron
hook
so
to
the
mewstone
he
went
and
for
lobsters
he
looked
and
when
he
came
to
a
certain
crack
in
the
rocks
he
was
so
excited
that
instead
of
putting
in
his
hook
he
put
in
his
hand
and
mr
lobster
was
at
home
and
caught
him
by
the
finger
and
held
on
said
the
mayor
and
pulled
as
hard
as
he
dared
but
the
more
he
pulled
the
more
the
lobster
pinched
till
he
was
forced
to
be
quiet
then
he
tried
to
get
his
hook
in
with
his
other
hand
but
the
hole
was
too
narrow
then
he
pulled
again
but
he
could
not
stand
the
pain
then
he
shouted
and
bawled
for
help
but
there
was
no
one
nearer
him
than
the
inside
the
breakwater
then
he
began
to
turn
a
little
pale
for
the
tide
flowed
and
still
the
lobster
held
on
then
he
turned
quite
white
for
the
tide
was
up
to
his
knees
and
still
the
lobster
held
on
then
he
thought
of
cutting
off
his
finger
but
he
wanted
two
things
to
do
it
and
a
knife
and
he
had
got
neither
then
he
turned
quite
yellow
for
the
tide
was
up
to
his
waist
and
still
the
lobster
held
on
then
he
thought
over
all
the
naughty
things
he
ever
had
done
all
the
sand
which
he
had
put
in
the
sugar
and
the
in
the
tea
and
the
water
in
the
treacle
and
the
salt
in
the
tobacco
because
his
brother
was
a
brewer
and
a
man
must
help
his
own
kin
then
he
turned
quite
blue
for
the
tide
was
up
to
his
breast
and
still
the
lobster
held
on
then
i
have
no
doubt
he
repented
fully
of
all
the
said
naughty
things
which
he
had
done
and
promised
to
mend
his
life
as
too
many
do
when
they
think
they
have
no
life
left
to
mend
whereby
as
they
fancy
they
make
a
very
cheap
bargain
but
the
old
fairy
with
the
birch
rod
soon
undeceives
them
and
then
he
grew
all
colours
at
once
and
turned
up
his
eyes
like
a
duck
in
thunder
for
the
water
was
up
to
his
chin
and
still
the
lobster
held
on
and
then
came
a
boat
round
the
mewstone
and
saw
his
head
sticking
up
out
of
the
water
one
said
it
was
a
keg
of
brandy
and
another
that
it
was
a
and
another
that
it
was
a
buoy
loose
and
another
that
it
was
a
black
diver
and
wanted
to
fire
at
it
which
would
not
have
been
pleasant
for
the
mayor
but
just
then
such
a
yell
came
out
of
a
great
hole
in
the
middle
of
it
that
the
midshipman
in
charge
guessed
what
it
was
and
bade
pull
up
to
it
as
fast
as
they
could
so
somehow
or
other
the
got
the
lobster
out
and
set
the
mayor
free
and
put
him
ashore
at
the
barbican
he
never
went
again
and
we
will
hope
he
put
no
more
salt
in
the
tobacco
not
even
to
sell
his
beer
picture
the
mayor
of
plymouth
and
that
is
the
story
of
the
mayor
of
plymouth
which
has
two
that
of
being
quite
true
and
second
that
of
having
as
folks
say
all
good
stories
ought
to
have
no
moral
whatsoever
no
more
indeed
has
any
part
of
this
book
because
it
is
a
fairy
tale
you
know
and
now
happened
to
tom
a
most
wonderful
thing
for
he
had
not
left
the
lobster
five
minutes
before
he
came
upon
a
a
real
live
sitting
on
the
white
sand
very
busy
about
a
little
point
of
rock
and
when
it
saw
tom
it
looked
up
for
a
moment
and
then
cried
you
are
not
one
of
us
you
are
a
new
baby
oh
how
delightful
and
it
ran
to
tom
and
tom
ran
to
it
and
they
hugged
and
kissed
each
other
for
ever
so
long
they
did
not
know
why
but
they
did
not
want
any
introductions
there
under
the
water
at
last
tom
said
where
have
you
been
all
this
while
i
have
been
looking
for
you
so
long
and
i
have
been
so
have
been
here
for
days
and
days
there
are
hundreds
of
us
about
the
rocks
how
was
it
you
did
not
see
us
or
hear
us
when
we
sing
and
romp
every
evening
before
we
go
home
tom
looked
at
the
baby
again
and
then
he
said
this
is
wonderful
i
have
seen
things
just
like
you
again
and
again
but
i
thought
you
were
shells
or
i
never
took
you
for
like
now
was
not
that
very
odd
so
odd
indeed
that
you
will
no
doubt
want
to
know
how
it
happened
and
why
tom
could
never
find
a
till
after
he
had
got
the
lobster
out
of
the
pot
and
if
you
will
read
this
story
nine
times
over
and
then
think
for
yourself
you
will
find
out
why
it
is
not
good
for
little
boys
to
be
told
everything
and
never
to
be
forced
to
use
their
own
wits
they
would
learn
then
no
more
than
they
do
at
famous
suburban
establishment
for
the
idler
members
of
the
youthful
aristocracy
where
the
masters
learn
the
lessons
and
the
boys
hear
saves
a
great
deal
of
the
time
being
said
the
baby
and
help
me
or
i
shall
not
have
finished
before
my
brothers
and
sisters
come
and
it
is
time
to
go
shall
i
help
you
at
this
poor
dear
little
rock
a
great
clumsy
boulder
came
rolling
by
in
the
last
storm
and
knocked
all
its
head
off
and
rubbed
off
all
its
flowers
and
now
i
must
plant
it
again
with
seaweeds
and
coralline
and
anemones
and
i
will
make
it
the
prettiest
little
on
all
the
so
they
worked
away
at
the
rock
and
planted
it
and
smoothed
the
sand
down
round
it
and
capital
fun
they
had
till
the
tide
began
to
turn
and
then
tom
heard
all
the
other
babies
coming
laughing
and
singing
and
shouting
and
romping
and
the
noise
they
made
was
just
like
the
noise
of
the
ripple
so
he
knew
that
he
had
been
hearing
and
seeing
the
all
along
only
he
did
not
know
them
because
his
eyes
and
ears
were
not
opened
and
in
they
came
dozens
and
dozens
of
them
some
bigger
than
tom
and
some
smaller
all
in
the
neatest
little
white
bathing
dresses
and
when
they
found
that
he
was
a
new
baby
they
hugged
him
and
kissed
him
and
then
put
him
in
the
middle
and
danced
round
him
on
the
sand
and
there
was
no
one
ever
so
happy
as
poor
little
tom
then
they
cried
all
at
once
must
come
away
home
we
must
come
away
home
or
the
tide
will
leave
us
dry
we
have
mended
all
the
broken
and
put
all
the
in
order
and
planted
all
the
shells
again
in
the
sand
and
nobody
will
see
where
the
ugly
storm
swept
in
last
and
this
is
the
reason
why
the
are
always
so
neat
and
clean
because
the
come
inshore
after
every
storm
to
sweep
them
out
and
comb
them
down
and
put
them
all
to
rights
again
only
where
men
are
wasteful
and
dirty
and
let
sewers
run
into
the
sea
instead
of
putting
the
stuff
upon
the
fields
like
thrifty
reasonable
souls
or
throw
heads
and
dead
or
any
other
refuse
into
the
water
or
in
any
way
make
a
mess
upon
the
clean
the
will
not
come
sometimes
not
for
hundreds
of
years
for
they
can
not
abide
anything
smelly
or
foul
but
leave
the
and
the
crabs
to
clear
away
everything
till
the
good
tidy
sea
has
covered
up
all
the
dirt
in
soft
mud
and
clean
sand
where
the
can
plant
live
cockles
and
whelks
and
and
and
and
make
a
pretty
live
garden
again
after
dirt
is
cleared
away
and
that
i
suppose
is
the
reason
why
there
are
no
at
any
which
i
have
ever
seen
and
where
is
the
home
of
the
in
fairy
isle
did
you
never
hear
of
the
blessed
brandan
how
he
preached
to
the
wild
irish
on
the
wild
wild
kerry
coast
he
and
five
other
hermits
till
they
were
weary
and
longed
to
rest
for
the
wild
irish
would
not
listen
to
them
or
come
to
confession
and
to
mass
but
liked
better
to
brew
potheen
and
dance
the
pater
and
knock
each
other
over
the
head
with
shillelaghs
and
shoot
each
other
from
behind
and
steal
each
cattle
and
burn
each
homes
till
brandan
and
his
friends
were
weary
of
them
for
they
would
not
learn
to
be
peaceable
christians
at
all
so
brandan
went
out
to
the
point
of
old
dunmore
and
looked
over
the
roaring
round
the
blasquets
at
the
end
of
all
the
world
and
away
into
the
ocean
and
that
i
had
wings
as
a
dove
and
far
away
before
the
setting
sun
he
saw
a
blue
fairy
sea
and
golden
fairy
islands
and
he
said
are
the
islands
of
the
then
he
and
his
friends
got
into
a
hooker
and
sailed
away
and
away
to
the
westward
and
were
never
heard
of
more
but
the
people
who
would
not
hear
him
were
changed
into
gorillas
and
gorillas
they
are
until
this
day
and
when
brandan
and
the
hermits
came
to
that
fairy
isle
they
found
it
overgrown
with
cedars
and
full
of
beautiful
birds
and
he
sat
down
under
the
cedars
and
preached
to
all
the
birds
in
the
air
and
they
liked
his
sermons
so
well
that
they
told
the
fishes
in
the
sea
and
they
came
and
brandan
preached
to
them
and
the
fishes
told
the
who
live
in
the
caves
under
the
isle
and
they
came
up
by
hundreds
every
sunday
and
brandan
got
quite
a
neat
little
and
there
he
taught
the
for
a
great
many
hundred
years
till
his
eyes
grew
too
dim
to
see
and
his
beard
grew
so
long
that
he
dared
not
walk
for
fear
of
treading
on
it
and
then
he
might
have
tumbled
down
and
at
last
he
and
the
five
hermits
fell
fast
asleep
under
the
and
there
they
sleep
unto
this
day
but
the
fairies
took
to
the
and
taught
them
their
lessons
themselves
and
some
say
that
brandan
will
awake
and
begin
to
teach
the
babies
once
more
but
some
think
that
he
will
sleep
on
for
better
for
worse
till
the
coming
of
the
cocqcigrues
but
on
still
clear
summer
evenings
when
the
sun
sinks
down
into
the
sea
among
golden
and
and
locks
and
friths
of
azure
sky
the
sailors
fancy
that
they
see
away
to
westward
fairy
isle
but
whether
men
can
see
it
or
not
isle
once
actually
stood
there
a
great
land
out
in
the
ocean
which
has
sunk
and
sunk
beneath
the
waves
old
plato
called
it
atlantis
and
told
strange
tales
of
the
wise
men
who
lived
therein
and
of
the
wars
they
fought
in
the
old
times
and
from
off
that
island
came
strange
flowers
which
linger
still
about
this
land
cornish
heath
and
cornish
moneywort
and
the
delicate
hair
and
the
which
covers
the
kerry
mountains
and
the
little
pink
butterwort
of
devon
and
the
great
blue
butterwort
of
ireland
and
the
connemara
heath
and
the
of
the
turk
waterfall
and
many
a
strange
plant
more
all
fairy
tokens
left
for
wise
men
and
good
children
from
off
isle
now
when
tom
got
there
he
found
that
the
isle
stood
all
on
pillars
and
that
its
roots
were
full
of
caves
there
were
pillars
of
black
basalt
like
staffa
and
pillars
of
green
and
crimson
serpentine
like
kynance
and
pillars
ribboned
with
red
and
white
and
yellow
sandstone
like
livermead
and
there
were
blue
grottoes
like
capri
and
white
grottoes
like
adelsberg
all
curtained
and
draped
with
seaweeds
purple
and
crimson
green
and
brown
and
strewn
with
soft
white
sand
on
which
the
sleep
every
night
but
to
keep
the
place
clean
and
sweet
the
crabs
picked
up
all
the
scraps
off
the
floor
and
ate
them
like
so
many
monkeys
while
the
rocks
were
covered
with
ten
thousand
and
corals
and
madrepores
who
scavenged
the
water
all
day
long
and
kept
it
nice
and
pure
but
to
make
up
to
them
for
having
to
do
such
nasty
work
they
were
not
left
black
and
dirty
as
poor
and
dustmen
are
no
the
fairies
are
more
considerate
and
just
than
that
and
have
dressed
them
all
in
the
most
beautiful
colours
and
patterns
till
they
look
like
vast
of
gay
blossoms
if
you
think
i
am
talking
nonsense
i
can
only
say
that
it
is
true
and
that
an
old
gentleman
named
fourier
used
to
say
that
we
ought
to
do
the
same
by
and
dustmen
and
honour
them
instead
of
despising
them
and
he
was
a
very
clever
old
gentleman
but
unfortunately
for
him
and
the
world
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
and
instead
of
watchmen
and
policemen
to
keep
out
nasty
things
at
night
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
and
most
wonderful
creatures
they
were
they
were
all
named
after
the
nereids
the
who
took
care
of
them
eunice
and
polynoe
phyllodoce
and
psamathe
and
all
the
rest
of
the
pretty
darlings
who
swim
round
their
queen
amphitrite
and
her
car
of
cameo
shell
they
were
dressed
in
green
velvet
and
black
velvet
and
purple
velvet
and
were
all
jointed
in
rings
and
some
of
them
had
three
hundred
brains
apiece
so
that
they
must
have
been
uncommonly
shrewd
detectives
and
some
had
eyes
in
their
tails
and
some
had
eyes
in
every
joint
so
that
they
kept
a
very
sharp
and
when
they
wanted
a
they
just
grew
one
at
the
end
of
their
own
tails
and
when
it
was
able
to
take
care
of
itself
it
dropped
off
so
that
they
brought
up
their
families
very
cheaply
but
if
any
nasty
thing
came
by
out
they
rushed
upon
it
and
then
out
of
each
of
their
hundreds
of
feet
there
sprang
a
whole
shop
of
so
which
stabbed
shot
poked
pricked
scratched
ripped
pinked
and
crimped
those
naughty
beasts
so
terribly
that
they
had
to
run
for
their
lives
or
else
be
chopped
into
small
pieces
and
be
eaten
afterwards
and
if
that
is
not
all
every
word
true
then
there
is
no
faith
in
microscopes
and
all
is
over
with
the
linnæan
society
and
there
were
the
in
thousands
more
than
tom
or
you
either
could
the
little
children
whom
the
good
fairies
take
to
because
their
cruel
mothers
and
fathers
will
not
all
who
are
untaught
and
brought
up
heathens
and
all
who
come
to
grief
by
or
ignorance
or
neglect
all
the
little
children
who
are
overlaid
or
given
gin
when
they
are
young
or
are
let
to
drink
out
of
hot
kettles
or
to
fall
into
the
fire
all
the
little
children
in
alleys
and
courts
and
cottages
who
die
by
fever
and
cholera
and
measles
and
scarlatina
and
nasty
complaints
which
no
one
has
any
business
to
have
and
which
no
one
will
have
some
day
when
folks
have
common
sense
and
all
the
little
children
who
have
been
killed
by
cruel
masters
and
wicked
soldiers
they
were
all
there
except
of
course
the
babes
of
bethlehem
who
were
killed
by
wicked
king
herod
for
they
were
taken
straight
to
heaven
long
ago
as
everybody
knows
and
we
call
them
the
holy
innocents
but
i
wish
tom
had
given
up
all
his
naughty
tricks
and
left
off
tormenting
dumb
animals
now
that
he
had
plenty
of
playfellows
to
amuse
him
instead
of
that
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
would
meddle
with
the
creatures
all
but
the
for
they
would
stand
no
nonsense
so
he
tickled
the
madrepores
to
make
them
shut
up
and
frightened
the
crabs
to
make
them
hide
in
the
sand
and
peep
out
at
him
with
the
tips
of
their
eyes
and
put
stones
into
the
mouths
to
make
them
fancy
that
their
dinner
was
coming
the
other
children
warned
him
and
said
care
what
you
are
at
bedonebyasyoudid
is
but
tom
never
heeded
them
being
quite
riotous
with
high
spirits
and
good
luck
till
one
friday
morning
early
bedonebyasyoudid
came
indeed
a
very
tremendous
lady
she
was
and
when
the
children
saw
her
they
all
stood
in
a
row
very
upright
indeed
and
smoothed
down
their
bathing
dresses
and
put
their
hands
behind
them
just
as
if
they
were
going
to
be
examined
by
the
inspector
and
she
had
on
a
black
bonnet
and
a
black
shawl
and
no
crinoline
at
all
and
a
pair
of
large
green
spectacles
and
a
great
hooked
nose
hooked
so
much
that
the
bridge
of
it
stood
quite
up
above
her
eyebrows
and
under
her
arm
she
carried
a
great
indeed
she
was
so
ugly
that
tom
was
tempted
to
make
faces
at
her
but
did
not
for
he
did
not
admire
the
look
of
the
under
her
arm
and
she
looked
at
the
children
one
by
one
and
seemed
very
much
pleased
with
them
though
she
never
asked
them
one
question
about
how
they
were
behaving
and
then
began
giving
them
all
sorts
of
nice
and
to
the
very
best
of
all
she
gave
made
out
of
cream
which
never
melt
under
water
and
if
you
quite
believe
me
then
just
is
more
cheap
and
plentiful
than
then
why
should
there
not
be
as
well
and
every
one
can
find
ready
quartered
too
if
they
will
look
for
them
at
low
tide
and
too
sometimes
hanging
in
bunches
and
if
you
will
go
to
nice
you
will
find
the
full
of
which
they
call
di
mare
though
i
suppose
they
call
them
de
now
out
of
compliment
to
that
most
successful
and
therefore
most
immaculate
potentate
who
is
seemingly
desirous
of
inheriting
the
blessing
pronounced
on
those
who
remove
their
and
perhaps
that
is
the
very
reason
why
the
place
is
called
nice
because
there
are
so
many
nice
things
in
the
sea
there
at
least
if
it
is
not
it
ought
to
be
picture
tom
now
little
tom
watched
all
these
sweet
things
given
away
till
his
mouth
watered
and
his
eyes
grew
as
round
as
an
for
he
hoped
that
his
turn
would
come
at
last
and
so
it
did
for
the
lady
called
him
up
and
held
out
her
fingers
with
something
in
them
and
popped
it
into
his
mouth
and
lo
and
behold
it
was
a
nasty
cold
hard
pebble
are
a
very
cruel
woman
said
he
and
began
to
whimper
you
are
a
very
cruel
boy
who
puts
pebbles
into
the
mouths
to
take
them
in
and
make
them
fancy
that
they
had
caught
a
good
dinner
as
you
did
to
them
so
i
must
do
to
told
you
that
said
tom
did
yourself
this
very
tom
had
never
opened
his
lips
so
he
was
very
much
taken
aback
indeed
every
one
tells
me
exactly
what
they
have
done
wrong
and
that
without
knowing
it
themselves
so
there
is
no
use
trying
to
hide
anything
from
me
now
go
and
be
a
good
boy
and
i
will
put
no
more
pebbles
in
your
mouth
if
you
put
none
in
other
did
not
know
there
was
any
harm
in
it
said
tom
you
know
now
people
continually
say
that
to
me
but
i
tell
them
if
you
know
that
fire
burns
that
is
no
reason
that
it
should
not
burn
you
and
if
you
know
that
dirt
breeds
fever
that
is
no
reason
why
the
fevers
should
not
kill
you
the
lobster
did
not
know
that
there
was
any
harm
in
getting
into
the
but
it
caught
him
all
the
me
thought
tom
knows
everything
and
so
she
did
indeed
so
if
you
do
not
know
that
things
are
wrong
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
be
punished
for
them
though
not
as
much
not
as
much
my
little
and
the
lady
looked
very
kindly
after
all
if
you
did
you
are
a
little
hard
on
a
poor
lad
said
tom
at
all
i
am
the
best
friend
you
ever
had
in
all
your
life
but
i
will
tell
you
i
can
not
help
punishing
people
when
they
do
wrong
i
like
it
no
more
than
they
do
i
am
often
very
very
sorry
for
them
poor
things
but
i
can
not
help
it
if
i
tried
not
to
do
it
i
should
do
it
all
the
same
for
i
work
by
machinery
just
like
an
engine
and
am
full
of
wheels
and
springs
inside
and
am
wound
up
very
carefully
so
that
i
can
not
help
it
long
ago
since
they
wound
you
up
asked
tom
for
he
thought
the
cunning
little
fellow
will
run
down
some
day
or
they
may
forget
to
wind
her
up
as
old
grimes
used
to
forget
to
wind
up
his
watch
when
he
came
in
from
the
and
then
i
shall
be
was
wound
up
once
and
for
all
so
long
ago
that
i
forget
all
about
me
said
tom
must
have
been
made
a
long
time
never
was
made
my
child
and
i
shall
go
for
ever
and
ever
for
i
am
as
old
as
eternity
and
yet
as
young
as
and
there
came
over
the
face
a
very
curious
solemn
and
very
sad
and
yet
very
very
sweet
and
she
looked
up
and
away
as
if
she
were
gazing
through
the
sea
and
through
the
sky
at
something
far
far
off
and
as
she
did
so
there
came
such
a
quiet
tender
patient
hopeful
smile
over
her
face
that
tom
thought
for
the
moment
that
she
did
not
look
ugly
at
all
and
no
more
she
did
for
she
was
like
a
great
many
people
who
have
not
a
pretty
feature
in
their
faces
and
yet
are
lovely
to
behold
and
draw
little
hearts
to
them
at
once
because
though
the
house
is
plain
enough
yet
from
the
windows
a
beautiful
and
good
spirit
is
looking
forth
and
tom
smiled
in
her
face
she
looked
so
pleasant
for
the
moment
and
the
strange
fairy
smiled
too
and
said
you
thought
me
very
ugly
just
now
did
you
not
tom
hung
down
his
head
and
got
very
red
about
the
ears
i
am
very
ugly
i
am
the
ugliest
fairy
in
the
world
and
i
shall
be
till
people
behave
themselves
as
they
ought
to
do
and
then
i
shall
grow
as
handsome
as
my
sister
who
is
the
loveliest
fairy
in
the
world
and
her
name
is
doasyouwouldbedoneby
so
she
begins
where
i
end
and
i
begin
where
she
ends
and
those
who
will
not
listen
to
her
must
listen
to
me
as
you
will
see
now
all
of
you
run
away
except
tom
and
he
may
stay
and
see
what
i
am
going
to
do
it
will
be
a
very
good
warning
for
him
to
begin
with
before
he
goes
to
school
tom
every
friday
i
come
down
here
and
call
up
all
who
have
little
children
and
serve
them
as
they
served
the
and
at
that
tom
was
frightened
and
crept
under
a
stone
which
made
the
two
crabs
who
lived
there
very
angry
and
frightened
their
friend
the
into
flapping
hysterics
but
he
would
not
move
for
them
and
first
she
called
up
all
the
doctors
who
give
little
children
so
much
physic
they
were
most
of
them
old
ones
for
the
young
ones
have
learnt
better
all
but
a
few
army
surgeons
who
still
fancy
that
a
inside
is
much
like
a
scotch
and
she
set
them
all
in
a
row
and
very
rueful
they
looked
for
they
knew
what
was
coming
and
first
she
pulled
all
their
teeth
out
and
then
she
bled
them
all
round
and
then
she
dosed
them
with
calomel
and
jalap
and
salts
and
senna
and
brimstone
and
treacle
and
horrible
faces
they
made
and
then
she
gave
them
a
great
emetic
of
mustard
and
water
and
no
basons
and
began
all
over
again
and
that
was
the
way
she
spent
the
morning
and
then
she
called
up
a
whole
troop
of
foolish
ladies
who
pinch
up
their
waists
and
toes
and
she
laced
them
all
up
in
tight
stays
so
that
they
were
choked
and
sick
and
their
noses
grew
red
and
their
hands
and
feet
swelled
and
then
she
crammed
their
poor
feet
into
the
most
dreadfully
tight
boots
and
made
them
all
dance
which
they
did
most
clumsily
indeed
and
then
she
asked
them
how
they
liked
it
and
when
they
said
not
at
all
she
let
them
go
because
they
had
only
done
it
out
of
foolish
fashion
fancying
it
was
for
their
good
as
if
waists
and
toes
could
be
pretty
or
wholesome
or
of
any
use
to
anybody
then
she
called
up
all
the
careless
nurserymaids
and
stuck
pins
into
them
all
over
and
wheeled
them
about
in
perambulators
with
tight
straps
across
their
stomachs
and
their
heads
and
arms
hanging
over
the
side
till
they
were
quite
sick
and
stupid
and
would
have
had
but
being
under
the
water
they
could
only
have
which
i
assure
you
are
nearly
as
bad
as
you
will
find
if
you
try
to
sit
under
a
and
you
hear
a
rumbling
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
sailors
will
tell
you
that
it
is
a
but
now
you
know
better
it
is
the
old
lady
wheeling
the
maids
about
in
perambulators
and
by
that
time
she
was
so
tired
she
had
to
go
to
luncheon
and
after
luncheon
she
set
to
work
again
and
called
up
all
the
cruel
regiments
and
brigades
of
them
and
when
she
saw
them
she
frowned
most
terribly
and
set
to
work
in
earnest
as
if
the
best
part
of
the
work
was
to
come
more
than
half
of
them
were
nasty
dirty
frowzy
grubby
smelly
old
monks
who
because
they
dare
not
hit
a
man
of
their
own
size
amused
themselves
with
beating
little
children
instead
as
you
may
see
in
the
picture
of
old
pope
gregory
good
man
and
true
though
he
was
when
he
meddled
with
things
which
he
did
understand
teaching
children
to
sing
their
with
a
tails
under
his
chair
but
because
they
never
had
any
children
of
their
own
they
took
into
their
heads
as
some
folks
do
still
that
they
were
the
only
people
in
the
world
who
knew
how
to
manage
children
and
they
first
brought
into
england
in
the
old
times
the
fashion
of
treating
free
boys
and
girls
too
worse
than
you
would
treat
a
dog
or
a
horse
but
bedonebyasyoudid
has
caught
them
all
long
ago
and
given
them
many
a
taste
of
their
own
rods
and
much
good
may
it
do
them
and
she
boxed
their
ears
and
thumped
them
over
the
head
with
rulers
and
pandied
their
hands
with
canes
and
told
them
that
they
told
stories
and
were
this
and
that
bad
sort
of
people
and
the
more
they
were
very
indignant
and
stood
upon
their
honour
and
declared
they
told
the
truth
the
more
she
declared
they
were
not
and
that
they
were
only
telling
lies
and
at
last
she
birched
them
all
round
soundly
with
her
great
and
set
them
each
an
imposition
of
three
hundred
thousand
lines
of
hebrew
to
learn
by
heart
before
she
came
back
next
friday
and
at
that
they
all
cried
and
howled
so
that
their
breaths
came
all
up
through
the
sea
like
bubbles
out
of
and
that
is
one
reason
of
the
bubbles
in
the
sea
there
are
others
but
that
is
the
one
which
principally
concerns
little
boys
and
by
that
time
she
was
so
tired
that
she
was
glad
to
stop
and
indeed
she
had
done
a
very
good
work
tom
did
not
quite
dislike
the
old
lady
but
he
could
not
help
thinking
her
a
little
no
wonder
if
she
was
poor
old
soul
for
if
she
has
to
wait
to
grow
handsome
till
people
do
as
they
would
be
done
by
she
will
have
to
wait
a
very
long
time
poor
old
bedonebyasyoudid
she
has
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
before
her
and
had
better
have
been
born
a
washerwoman
and
stood
over
a
tub
all
day
but
you
see
people
can
not
always
choose
their
own
profession
but
tom
longed
to
ask
her
one
question
and
after
all
whenever
she
looked
at
him
she
did
not
look
cross
at
all
and
now
and
then
there
was
a
funny
smile
in
her
face
and
she
chuckled
to
herself
in
a
way
which
gave
tom
courage
and
at
last
he
said
may
i
ask
you
a
question
my
little
you
bring
all
the
bad
masters
here
and
serve
them
out
too
the
butties
that
knock
about
the
poor
and
the
nailers
that
file
off
their
noses
and
hammer
their
fingers
and
all
the
master
sweeps
like
my
master
grimes
i
saw
him
fall
into
the
water
long
ago
so
i
surely
expected
he
would
have
been
here
sure
he
was
bad
enough
to
then
the
old
lady
looked
so
very
stern
that
tom
was
quite
frightened
and
sorry
that
he
had
been
so
bold
but
she
was
not
angry
with
him
she
only
answered
look
after
them
all
the
week
round
and
they
are
in
a
very
different
place
from
this
because
they
knew
that
they
were
doing
she
spoke
very
quietly
but
there
was
something
in
her
voice
which
made
tom
tingle
from
head
to
foot
as
if
he
had
got
into
a
shoal
of
these
people
she
went
on
not
know
that
they
were
doing
wrong
they
were
only
stupid
and
impatient
and
therefore
i
only
punish
them
till
they
become
patient
and
learn
to
use
their
common
sense
like
reasonable
beings
but
as
for
and
and
nailer
lads
my
sister
has
set
good
people
to
stop
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
very
much
obliged
to
her
i
am
for
if
she
could
only
stop
the
cruel
masters
from
poor
children
i
should
grow
handsome
at
least
a
thousand
years
sooner
and
now
do
you
be
a
good
boy
and
do
as
you
would
be
done
by
which
they
did
not
and
then
when
my
sister
madame
doasyouwouldbedoneby
comes
on
sunday
perhaps
she
will
take
notice
of
you
and
teach
you
how
to
behave
she
understands
that
better
than
i
and
so
she
went
tom
was
very
glad
to
hear
that
there
was
no
chance
of
meeting
grimes
again
though
he
was
a
little
sorry
for
him
considering
that
he
used
sometimes
to
give
him
the
leavings
of
the
beer
but
he
determined
to
be
a
very
good
boy
all
saturday
and
he
was
for
he
never
frightened
one
crab
nor
tickled
any
live
corals
nor
put
stones
into
the
sea
mouths
to
make
them
fancy
they
had
got
a
dinner
and
when
sunday
morning
came
sure
enough
doasyouwouldbedoneby
came
too
whereat
all
the
little
children
began
dancing
and
clapping
their
hands
and
tom
danced
too
with
all
his
might
and
as
for
the
pretty
lady
i
can
not
tell
you
what
the
colour
of
her
hair
was
or
of
her
eyes
no
more
could
tom
for
when
any
one
looks
at
her
all
they
can
think
of
is
that
she
has
the
sweetest
kindest
tenderest
funniest
merriest
face
they
ever
saw
or
want
to
see
but
tom
saw
that
she
was
a
very
tall
woman
as
tall
as
her
sister
but
instead
of
being
gnarly
and
horny
and
scaly
and
prickly
like
her
she
was
the
most
nice
soft
fat
smooth
pussy
cuddly
delicious
creature
who
ever
nursed
a
baby
and
she
understood
babies
thoroughly
for
she
had
plenty
of
her
own
whole
rows
and
regiments
of
them
and
has
to
this
day
and
all
her
delight
was
whenever
she
had
a
spare
moment
to
play
with
babies
in
which
she
showed
herself
a
woman
of
sense
for
babies
are
the
best
company
and
the
pleasantest
playfellows
in
the
world
at
least
so
all
the
wise
people
in
the
world
think
and
therefore
when
the
children
saw
her
they
naturally
all
caught
hold
of
her
and
pulled
her
till
she
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
climbed
into
her
lap
and
clung
round
her
neck
and
caught
hold
of
her
hands
and
then
they
all
put
their
thumbs
into
their
mouths
and
began
cuddling
and
purring
like
so
many
kittens
as
they
ought
to
have
done
while
those
who
could
get
nowhere
else
sat
down
on
the
sand
and
cuddled
her
no
one
you
know
wear
shoes
in
the
water
except
horrid
old
who
are
afraid
of
the
pinching
their
horny
toes
and
tom
stood
staring
at
them
for
he
could
not
understand
what
it
was
all
about
who
are
you
you
little
darling
she
said
that
is
the
new
baby
they
all
cried
pulling
their
thumbs
out
of
their
mouths
he
never
had
any
mother
and
they
all
put
their
thumbs
back
again
for
they
did
not
wish
to
lose
any
time
i
will
be
his
mother
and
he
shall
have
the
very
best
place
so
get
out
all
of
you
this
and
she
took
up
two
great
armfuls
of
hundred
under
one
arm
and
thirteen
hundred
under
the
threw
them
away
right
and
left
into
the
water
but
they
minded
it
no
more
than
the
naughty
boys
in
struwelpeter
minded
when
nicholas
dipped
them
in
his
inkstand
and
did
not
even
take
their
thumbs
out
of
their
mouths
but
came
paddling
and
wriggling
back
to
her
like
so
many
tadpoles
till
you
could
see
nothing
of
her
from
head
to
foot
for
the
swarm
of
little
babies
but
she
took
tom
in
her
arms
and
laid
him
in
the
softest
place
of
all
and
kissed
him
and
patted
him
and
talked
to
him
tenderly
and
low
such
things
as
he
had
never
heard
before
in
his
life
and
tom
looked
up
into
her
eyes
and
loved
her
and
loved
till
he
fell
fast
asleep
from
pure
love
and
when
he
woke
she
was
telling
the
children
a
story
and
what
story
did
she
tell
them
one
story
she
told
them
which
begins
every
christmas
eve
and
yet
never
ends
at
all
for
ever
and
ever
and
as
she
went
on
the
children
took
their
thumbs
out
of
their
mouths
and
listened
quite
seriously
but
not
sadly
at
all
for
she
never
told
them
anything
sad
and
tom
listened
too
and
never
grew
tired
of
listening
and
he
listened
so
long
that
he
fell
fast
asleep
again
and
when
he

nursing

little
tom

so
nice
i
never
had
any
one
to
cuddle

go
away
said

time
for
only

so
what
shall

be
doll
you

the
doll

all
the
babies
at
once
picture
the
doll
so
the
strange
fairy
sang
once
had
a
sweet
little
prettiest
doll
in
the
cheeks
were
so
red
and
so
her
hair
was
so
charmingly
i
lost
my
poor
little
i
played
in
the
heath
one
i
cried
for
her
more
than
a
i
never
could
find
where
she
picture
the
broken
doll
found
my
poor
little
i
played
in
the
heath
one
say
she
is
terribly
her
paint
is
all
washed
her
arm
trodden
off
by
the
her
hair
not
the
least
bit
old
sake
she
is
prettiest
doll
in
the
what
a
silly
song
for
a
fairy
to
sing
and
what
silly
to
be
quite
delighted
at
it
well
but
you
see
they
have
not
the
advantage
of
aunt
arguments
in
the
down
below
said
the
fairy
to
tom
you
be
a
good
boy
for
my
sake
and
torment
no
more
till
i
come
back
you
will
cuddle
me
again
said
poor
little
tom
course
i
will
you
little
duck
i
should
like
to
take
you
with
me
and
cuddle
you
all
the
way
only
i
must
not
and
away
she
went
so
tom
really
tried
to
be
a
good
boy
and
tormented
no
after
that
as
long
as
he
lived
and
he
is
quite
alive
i
assure
you
still
oh
how
good
little
boys
ought
to
be
who
have
kind
pussy
mammas
to
cuddle
them
and
tell
them
stories
and
how
afraid
they
ought
to
be
of
growing
naughty
and
bringing
tears
into
their
pretty
eyes
picture
little
both
with
mother
chapter
vi
little
child
yet
glorious
in
the
night
of
freedom
on
thy
height
why
with
such
earnest
pains
dost
thou
provoke
the
years
to
bring
the
inevitable
thus
blindly
with
thy
blessedness
at
strife
full
soon
thy
soul
shall
have
her
earthly
freight
and
custom
lie
upon
thee
with
a
weight
heavy
as
frost
and
deep
almost
as
wordsworth
picture
the
officer
and
a
crying
child
here
i
come
to
the
very
saddest
part
of
all
my
story
i
know
some
people
will
only
laugh
at
it
and
call
it
much
ado
about
nothing
but
i
know
one
man
who
would
not
and
he
was
an
officer
with
a
pair
of
gray
moustaches
as
long
as
your
arm
who
said
once
in
company
that
two
of
the
most
sights
in
the
world
which
moved
him
most
to
tears
which
he
would
do
anything
to
prevent
or
remedy
were
a
child
over
a
broken
toy
and
a
child
stealing
sweets
the
company
did
not
laugh
at
him
his
moustaches
were
too
long
and
too
gray
for
that
but
after
he
was
gone
they
called
him
sentimental
and
so
forth
all
but
one
dear
little
old
quaker
lady
with
a
soul
as
white
as
her
cap
who
was
not
of
course
generally
partial
to
soldiers
and
she
said
very
quietly
like
a
quaker
it
is
borne
upon
my
mind
that
that
is
a
truly
brave
now
you
may
fancy
that
tom
was
quite
good
when
he
had
everything
that
he
could
want
or
wish
but
you
would
be
very
much
mistaken
being
quite
comfortable
is
a
very
good
thing
but
it
does
not
make
people
good
indeed
it
sometimes
makes
them
naughty
as
it
has
made
the
people
in
america
and
as
it
made
the
people
in
the
bible
who
waxed
fat
and
kicked
like
horses
overfed
and
underworked
and
i
am
very
sorry
to
say
that
this
happened
to
little
tom
for
he
grew
so
fond
of
the
and
that
his
foolish
little
head
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
he
was
always
longing
for
more
and
wondering
when
the
strange
lady
would
come
again
and
give
him
some
and
what
she
would
give
him
and
how
much
and
whether
she
would
give
him
more
than
the
others
and
he
thought
of
nothing
but
lollipops
by
day
and
dreamt
of
nothing
else
by
what
happened
then
that
he
began
to
watch
the
lady
to
see
where
she
kept
the
sweet
things
and
began
hiding
and
sneaking
and
following
her
about
and
pretending
to
be
looking
the
other
way
or
going
after
something
else
till
he
found
out
that
she
kept
them
in
a
beautiful
cabinet
away
in
a
deep
crack
of
the
rocks
and
he
longed
to
go
to
the
cabinet
and
yet
he
was
afraid
and
then
he
longed
again
and
was
less
afraid
and
at
last
by
continual
thinking
about
it
he
longed
so
violently
that
he
was
not
afraid
at
all
and
one
night
when
all
the
other
children
were
asleep
and
he
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
lollipops
he
crept
away
among
the
rocks
and
got
to
the
cabinet
and
behold
it
was
open
but
when
he
saw
all
the
nice
things
inside
instead
of
being
delighted
he
was
quite
frightened
and
wished
he
had
never
come
there
and
then
he
would
only
touch
them
and
he
did
and
then
he
would
only
taste
one
and
he
did
and
then
he
would
only
eat
one
and
he
did
and
then
he
would
only
eat
two
and
then
three
and
so
on
and
then
he
was
terrified
lest
she
should
come
and
catch
him
and
began
gobbling
them
down
so
fast
that
he
did
not
taste
them
or
have
any
pleasure
in
them
and
then
he
felt
sick
and
would
have
only
one
more
and
then
only
one
more
again
and
so
on
till
he
had
eaten
them
all
up
and
all
the
while
close
behind
him
stood
bedonebyasyoudid
some
people
may
say
but
why
did
she
not
keep
her
cupboard
locked
well
i
may
seem
a
very
strange
thing
but
she
never
does
keep
her
cupboard
locked
every
one
may
go
and
taste
for
themselves
and
fare
accordingly
it
is
very
odd
but
so
it
is
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
she
knows
best
perhaps
she
wishes
people
to
keep
their
fingers
out
of
the
fire
by
having
them
burned
she
took
off
her
spectacles
because
she
did
not
like
to
see
too
much
and
in
her
pity
she
arched
up
her
eyebrows
into
her
very
hair
and
her
eyes
grew
so
wide
that
they
would
have
taken
in
all
the
sorrows
of
the
world
and
filled
with
great
big
tears
as
they
too
often
do
but
all
she
said
was
you
poor
little
dear
you
are
just
like
all
the
but
she
said
it
to
herself
and
tom
neither
heard
nor
saw
her
now
you
must
not
fancy
that
she
was
sentimental
at
all
if
you
do
and
think
that
she
is
going
to
let
off
you
or
me
or
any
human
being
when
we
do
wrong
because
she
is
too
to
punish
us
then
you
will
find
yourself
very
much
mistaken
as
many
a
man
does
every
year
and
every
day
but
what
did
the
strange
fairy
do
when
she
saw
all
her
lollipops
eaten
did
she
fly
at
tom
catch
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
hold
him
howk
him
hump
him
hurry
him
hit
him
poke
him
pull
him
pinch
him
pound
him
put
him
in
the
corner
shake
him
slap
him
set
him
on
a
cold
stone
to
reconsider
himself
and
so
forth
not
a
bit
you
may
watch
her
at
work
if
you
know
where
to
find
her
but
you
will
never
see
her
do
that
for
if
she
had
she
knew
quite
well
tom
would
have
fought
and
kicked
and
bit
and
said
bad
words
and
turned
again
that
moment
into
a
naughty
little
heathen
with
his
hand
like
of
old
against
every
man
and
every
hand
against
him
did
she
question
him
hurry
him
frighten
him
threaten
him
to
make
him
confess
not
a
bit
you
may
see
her
as
i
said
at
her
work
often
enough
if
you
know
where
to
look
for
her
but
you
will
never
see
her
do
that
for
if
she
had
she
would
have
tempted
him
to
tell
lies
in
his
fright
and
that
would
have
been
worse
for
him
if
possible
than
even
becoming
a
heathen
again
no
she
leaves
that
for
anxious
parents
and
teachers
lazy
ones
some
call
them
who
instead
of
giving
children
a
fair
trial
such
as
they
would
expect
and
demand
for
themselves
force
them
by
fright
to
confess
their
own
is
so
cruel
and
unfair
that
no
judge
on
the
bench
dare
do
it
to
the
wickedest
thief
or
murderer
for
the
good
british
law
forbids
and
even
punish
them
to
make
them
confess
which
is
so
detestable
a
crime
that
it
is
never
committed
now
save
by
inquisitors
and
kings
of
naples
and
a
few
other
wretched
people
of
whom
the
world
is
weary
and
then
they
say
have
trained
up
the
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
when
he
grew
up
he
has
departed
from
it
why
then
did
solomon
say
that
he
would
not
depart
from
it
but
perhaps
the
way
of
beating
and
hurrying
and
frightening
and
questioning
was
not
the
way
that
the
child
should
go
for
it
is
not
even
the
way
in
which
a
colt
should
go
if
you
want
to
break
it
in
and
make
it
a
quiet
serviceable
horse
some
folks
may
say
but
the
fairy
does
not
need
to
do
that
if
she
knows
everything
true
but
if
she
did
not
know
she
would
not
surely
behave
worse
than
a
british
judge
and
jury
and
no
more
should
parents
and
teachers
either
so
she
just
said
nothing
at
all
about
the
matter
not
even
when
tom
came
next
day
with
the
rest
for
sweet
things
he
was
horribly
afraid
of
coming
but
he
was
still
more
afraid
of
staying
away
lest
any
one
should
suspect
him
he
was
dreadfully
afraid
too
lest
there
should
be
no
was
to
be
expected
he
having
eaten
them
lest
then
the
fairy
should
inquire
who
had
taken
them
but
behold
she
pulled
out
just
as
many
as
ever
which
astonished
tom
and
frightened
him
still
more
and
when
the
fairy
looked
him
full
in
the
face
he
shook
from
head
to
foot
however
she
gave
him
his
share
like
the
rest
and
he
thought
within
himself
that
she
could
not
have
found
him
out
but
when
he
put
the
sweets
into
his
mouth
he
hated
the
taste
of
them
and
they
made
him
so
sick
that
he
had
to
get
away
as
fast
as
he
could
and
terribly
sick
he
was
and
very
cross
and
unhappy
all
the
week
after
then
when
next
week
came
he
had
his
share
again
and
again
the
fairy
looked
him
full
in
the
face
but
more
sadly
than
she
had
ever
looked
and
he
could
not
bear
the
sweets
but
took
them
again
in
spite
of
himself
picture
prickly
tom
and
when
doasyouwouldbedoneby
came
he
wanted
to
be
cuddled
like
the
rest
but
she
said
very
seriously
should
like
to
cuddle
you
but
i
can
not
you
are
so
horny
and
and
tom
looked
at
himself
and
he
was
all
over
prickles
just
like
a
which
was
quite
natural
for
you
must
know
and
believe
that
souls
make
their
bodies
just
as
a
snail
makes
its
shell
i
am
not
joking
my
little
man
i
am
in
serious
solemn
earnest
and
therefore
when
soul
grew
all
prickly
with
naughty
tempers
his
body
could
not
help
growing
prickly
too
so
that
nobody
would
cuddle
him
or
play
with
him
or
even
like
to
look
at
him
what
could
tom
do
now
but
go
away
and
hide
in
a
corner
and
cry
for
nobody
would
play
with
him
and
he
knew
full
well
why
and
he
was
so
miserable
all
that
week
that
when
the
ugly
fairy
came
and
looked
at
him
once
more
full
in
the
face
more
seriously
and
sadly
than
ever
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
thrust
the
sweetmeats
away
saying
i
want
any
i
bear
them
now
and
then
burst
out
crying
poor
little
man
and
told
bedonebyasyoudid
every
word
as
it
happened
he
was
horribly
frightened
when
he
had
done
so
for
he
expected
her
to
punish
him
very
severely
but
instead
she
only
took
him
up
and
kissed
him
which
was
not
quite
pleasant
for
her
chin
was
very
bristly
indeed
but
he
was
so
he
thought
that
rough
kissing
was
better
than
none
will
forgive
you
little
man
she
said
always
forgive
every
one
the
moment
they
tell
me
the
truth
of
their
own
you
will
take
away
all
these
nasty
prickles
is
a
very
different
matter
you
put
them
there
yourself
and
only
you
can
take
them
how
can
i
do
that
asked
tom
crying
afresh
i
think
it
is
time
for
you
to
go
to
school
so
i
shall
fetch
you
a
schoolmistress
who
will
teach
you
how
to
get
rid
of
your
and
so
she
went
away
tom
was
frightened
at
the
notion
of
a
for
he
thought
she
would
certainly
come
with
a
or
a
cane
but
he
comforted
himself
at
last
that
she
might
be
something
like
the
old
woman
in
she
was
not
in
the
least
for
when
the
fairy
brought
her
she
was
the
most
beautiful
little
girl
that
ever
was
seen
with
long
curls
floating
behind
her
like
a
golden
cloud
and
long
robes
floating
all
round
her
like
a
silver
one
picture
tom
and
the
little
girl
he
is
said
the
fairy
you
must
teach
him
to
be
good
whether
you
like
or
know
said
the
little
girl
but
she
did
not
seem
quite
to
like
for
she
put
her
finger
in
her
mouth
and
looked
at
tom
under
her
brows
and
tom
put
his
finger
in
his
mouth
and
looked
at
her
under
his
brows
for
he
was
horribly
ashamed
of
himself
the
little
girl
seemed
hardly
to
know
how
to
begin
and
perhaps
she
would
never
have
begun
at
all
if
poor
tom
had
not
burst
out
crying
and
begged
her
to
teach
him
to
be
good
and
help
him
to
cure
his
prickles
and
at
that
she
grew
so
that
she
began
teaching
him
as
prettily
as
ever
child
was
taught
in
the
world
and
what
did
the
little
girl
teach
tom
she
taught
him
first
what
you
have
been
taught
ever
since
you
said
your
first
prayers
at
your
knees
but
she
taught
him
much
more
simply
for
the
lessons
in
that
world
my
child
have
no
such
hard
words
in
them
as
the
lessons
in
this
and
therefore
the
like
them
better
than
you
like
your
lessons
and
long
to
learn
them
more
and
more
and
grown
men
can
not
puzzle
nor
quarrel
over
their
meaning
as
they
do
here
on
land
for
those
lessons
all
rise
clear
and
pure
like
the
test
out
of
overton
pool
out
of
the
everlasting
ground
of
all
life
and
truth
so
she
taught
tom
every
day
in
the
week
only
on
sundays
she
always
went
away
home
and
the
kind
fairy
took
her
place
and
before
she
had
taught
tom
many
sundays
his
prickles
had
vanished
quite
away
and
his
skin
was
smooth
and
clean
again
me
said
the
little
girl
i
know
you
now
you
are
the
very
same
little
who
came
into
my
me
cried
tom
i
know
you
too
now
you
are
the
very
little
white
lady
whom
i
saw
in
and
he
jumped
at
her
and
longed
to
hug
and
kiss
her
but
did
not
remembering
that
she
was
a
lady
born
so
he
only
jumped
round
and
round
her
till
he
was
quite
tired
and
then
they
began
telling
each
other
all
their
he
had
got
into
the
water
and
she
had
fallen
over
the
rock
and
how
he
had
swum
down
to
the
sea
and
how
she
had
flown
out
of
the
window
and
how
this
that
and
the
other
till
it
was
all
talked
out
and
then
they
both
began
over
again
and
i
say
which
of
the
two
talked
fastest
and
then
they
set
to
work
at
their
lessons
again
and
both
liked
them
so
well
that
they
went
on
well
till
seven
full
years
were
past
and
gone
you
may
fancy
that
tom
was
quite
content
and
happy
all
those
seven
years
but
the
truth
is
he
was
not
he
had
always
one
thing
on
his
mind
and
that
little
ellie
went
when
she
went
home
on
sundays
to
a
very
beautiful
place
she
said
but
what
was
the
beautiful
place
like
and
where
was
it
ah
that
is
just
what
she
could
not
say
and
it
is
strange
but
true
that
no
one
can
say
and
that
those
who
have
been
oftenest
in
it
or
even
nearest
to
it
can
say
least
about
it
and
make
people
understand
least
what
it
is
like
there
are
a
good
many
folks
about
the
where
tom
went
afterwards
who
pretend
to
know
it
from
north
to
south
as
well
as
if
they
had
been
penny
postmen
there
but
as
they
are
safe
at
the
nine
hundred
and
million
miles
away
what
they
say
can
not
concern
us
but
the
dear
sweet
loving
wise
good
people
who
really
go
there
can
never
tell
you
anything
about
it
save
that
it
is
the
most
beautiful
place
in
all
the
world
and
if
you
ask
them
more
they
grow
modest
and
hold
their
peace
for
fear
of
being
laughed
at
and
quite
right
they
are
so
all
that
good
little
ellie
could
say
was
that
it
was
worth
all
the
rest
of
the
world
put
together
and
of
course
that
only
made
tom
the
more
anxious
to
go
likewise
ellie
he
said
at
last
will
know
why
i
can
not
go
with
you
when
you
go
home
on
sundays
or
i
shall
have
no
peace
and
give
you
none
must
ask
the
fairies
so
when
the
fairy
bedonebyasyoudid
came
next
tom
asked
her
boys
who
are
only
fit
to
play
with
can
not
go
there
she
said
who
go
there
must
go
first
where
they
do
not
like
and
do
what
they
do
not
like
and
help
somebody
they
do
not
did
ellie
do
that
and
ellie
blushed
and
said
tom
i
did
not
like
coming
here
at
first
i
was
so
much
happier
at
home
where
it
is
always
sunday
and
i
was
afraid
of
you
tom
at
first
i
was
all
over
prickles
but
i
am
not
prickly
now
am
i
miss
ellie
said
ellie
like
you
very
much
now
and
i
like
coming
here
perhaps
said
the
fairy
will
learn
to
like
going
where
you
like
and
helping
some
one
that
you
like
as
ellie
but
tom
put
his
finger
in
his
mouth
and
hung
his
head
down
for
he
did
not
see
that
at
all
so
when
doasyouwouldbedoneby
came
tom
asked
her
for
he
thought
in
his
little
head
she
is
not
so
strict
as
her
sister
and
perhaps
she
may
let
me
off
more
easily
ah
tom
tom
silly
fellow
and
yet
i
know
why
i
should
blame
you
while
so
many
grown
people
have
got
the
very
same
notion
in
their
heads
but
when
they
try
it
they
get
just
the
same
answer
as
tom
did
for
when
he
asked
the
second
fairy
she
told
him
just
what
the
first
did
and
in
the
very
same
words
tom
was
very
unhappy
at
that
and
when
ellie
went
home
on
sunday
he
fretted
and
cried
all
day
and
did
not
care
to
listen
to
the
stories
about
good
children
though
they
were
prettier
than
ever
indeed
the
more
he
overheard
of
them
the
less
he
liked
to
listen
because
they
were
all
about
children
who
did
what
they
did
not
like
and
took
trouble
for
other
people
and
worked
to
feed
their
little
brothers
and
sisters
instead
of
caring
only
for
their
play
and
when
she
began
to
tell
a
story
about
a
holy
child
in
old
times
who
was
martyred
by
the
heathen
because
it
would
not
worship
idols
tom
could
bear
no
more
and
ran
away
and
hid
among
the
rocks
and
when
ellie
came
back
he
was
shy
with
her
because
he
fancied
she
looked
down
on
him
and
thought
him
a
coward
and
then
he
grew
quite
cross
with
her
because
she
was
superior
to
him
and
did
what
he
could
not
do
and
poor
ellie
was
quite
surprised
and
sad
and
at
last
tom
burst
out
crying
but
he
would
not
tell
her
what
was
really
in
his
mind
and
all
the
while
he
was
eaten
up
with
curiosity
to
know
where
ellie
went
to
so
that
he
began
not
to
care
for
his
playmates
or
for
the
or
anything
else
but
perhaps
that
made
matters
all
the
easier
for
him
for
he
grew
so
discontented
with
everything
round
him
that
he
did
not
care
to
stay
and
did
not
care
where
he
went
he
said
at
last
am
so
miserable
here
go
if
only
you
will
go
with
me
said
ellie
wish
i
might
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
the
fairy
says
that
you
must
go
alone
if
you
go
at
all
now
poke
that
poor
crab
about
for
he
was
feeling
very
naughty
and
mischievous
the
fairy
will
have
to
punish
tom
was
very
nearly
saying
care
if
she
does
but
he
stopped
himself
in
time
know
what
she
wants
me
to
do
he
said
whining
most
dolefully
wants
me
to
go
after
that
horrid
old
grimes
i
like
him
certain
and
if
i
find
him
he
will
turn
me
into
a
again
i
know
what
i
have
been
afraid
of
all
he
know
as
much
as
that
nobody
can
turn
into
sweeps
or
hurt
them
at
all
as
long
as
they
are
said
naughty
tom
see
what
you
want
you
are
persuading
me
all
along
to
go
because
you
are
tired
of
me
and
want
to
get
rid
of
little
ellie
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
at
that
and
they
were
all
brimming
over
with
tears
tom
tom
she
said
very
then
she
cried
tom
where
are
you
and
tom
cried
ellie
where
are
you
for
neither
of
them
could
see
each
the
least
little
ellie
vanished
quite
away
and
tom
heard
her
voice
calling
him
and
growing
smaller
and
smaller
and
fainter
and
fainter
till
all
was
silent
who
was
frightened
then
but
tom
he
swam
up
and
down
among
the
rocks
into
all
the
halls
and
chambers
faster
than
ever
he
swam
before
but
could
not
find
her
he
shouted
after
her
but
she
did
not
answer
he
asked
all
the
other
children
but
they
had
not
seen
her
and
at
last
he
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
water
and
began
crying
and
screaming
for
perhaps
was
the
best
thing
to
she
came
in
a
moment
picture
tom
crying
said
tom
dear
oh
dear
i
have
been
naughty
to
ellie
and
i
have
killed
know
i
have
killed
quite
that
said
the
fairy
i
have
sent
her
away
home
and
she
will
not
come
back
again
for
i
do
not
know
how
and
at
that
tom
cried
so
bitterly
that
the
salt
sea
was
swelled
with
his
tears
and
the
tide
was
of
an
inch
higher
than
it
had
been
the
day
before
but
perhaps
that
was
owing
to
the
waxing
of
the
moon
it
may
have
been
so
but
it
is
considered
right
in
the
new
philosophy
you
know
to
give
spiritual
causes
for
physical
in
and
of
course
physical
causes
for
spiritual
ones
like
thinking
and
praying
and
knowing
right
from
wrong
and
so
they
odds
it
till
it
comes
even
as
folks
say
down
in
berkshire
cruel
of
you
to
send
ellie
away
sobbed
tom
i
will
find
her
again
if
i
go
to
the
end
to
look
for
the
fairy
did
not
slap
tom
and
tell
him
to
hold
his
tongue
but
she
took
him
on
her
lap
very
kindly
just
as
her
sister
would
have
done
and
put
him
in
mind
how
it
was
not
her
fault
because
she
was
wound
up
inside
like
watches
and
could
not
help
doing
things
whether
she
liked
or
not
and
then
she
told
him
how
he
had
been
in
the
nursery
long
enough
and
must
go
out
now
and
see
the
world
if
he
intended
ever
to
be
a
man
and
how
he
must
go
all
alone
by
himself
as
every
one
else
that
ever
was
born
has
to
go
and
see
with
his
own
eyes
and
smell
with
his
own
nose
and
make
his
own
bed
and
lie
on
it
and
burn
his
own
fingers
if
he
put
them
into
the
fire
and
then
she
told
him
how
many
fine
things
there
were
to
be
seen
in
the
world
and
what
an
odd
curious
pleasant
orderly
respectable
and
on
the
whole
successful
as
indeed
might
have
been
expected
sort
of
a
place
it
was
if
people
would
only
be
tolerably
brave
and
honest
and
good
in
it
and
then
she
told
him
not
to
be
afraid
of
anything
he
met
for
nothing
would
harm
him
if
he
remembered
all
his
lessons
and
did
what
he
knew
was
right
and
at
last
she
comforted
poor
little
tom
so
much
that
he
was
quite
eager
to
go
and
wanted
to
set
out
that
minute
he
said
i
might
see
ellie
once
before
i
went
do
you
want
that
i
should
be
so
much
happier
if
i
thought
she
had
forgiven
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
there
stood
ellie
smiling
and
looking
so
happy
that
tom
longed
to
kiss
her
but
was
still
afraid
it
would
not
be
respectful
because
she
was
a
lady
born
am
going
ellie
said
tom
am
going
if
it
is
to
the
end
but
i
like
going
at
all
and
the
pooh
pooh
said
the
fairy
will
like
it
very
well
indeed
you
little
rogue
and
you
know
that
at
the
bottom
of
your
heart
but
if
you
i
will
make
you
like
it
come
here
and
see
what
happens
to
people
who
do
only
what
is
and
she
took
out
of
one
of
her
cupboards
she
had
all
sorts
of
mysterious
cupboards
in
the
cracks
of
the
rocks
the
most
wonderful
waterproof
book
full
of
such
photographs
as
never
were
seen
for
she
had
found
out
photography
and
this
is
a
fact
more
than
years
before
anybody
was
born
and
what
is
more
her
photographs
did
not
merely
represent
light
and
shade
as
ours
do
but
colour
also
and
all
colours
as
you
may
see
if
you
look
at
a
tail
or
a
wing
or
indeed
most
things
that
are
or
can
be
so
to
speak
and
therefore
her
photographs
were
very
curious
and
famous
and
the
children
looked
with
great
delight
for
the
opening
of
the
book
and
on
the
was
written
history
of
the
great
and
famous
nation
of
the
doasyoulikes
who
came
away
from
the
country
of
hardwork
because
they
wanted
to
play
on
the
harp
all
day
in
the
first
picture
they
saw
these
doasyoulikes
living
in
the
land
of
readymade
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
where
flapdoodle
grows
wild
and
if
you
want
to
know
what
that
is
you
must
read
peter
simple
they
lived
very
much
such
a
life
as
those
jolly
old
greeks
in
sicily
whom
you
may
see
painted
on
the
ancient
vases
and
really
there
seemed
to
be
great
excuses
for
them
for
they
had
no
need
to
work
instead
of
houses
they
lived
in
the
beautiful
caves
of
tufa
and
bathed
in
the
warm
springs
three
times
a
day
and
as
for
clothes
it
was
so
warm
there
that
the
gentlemen
walked
about
in
little
beside
a
cocked
hat
and
a
pair
of
straps
or
some
light
summer
tackle
of
that
kind
and
the
ladies
all
gathered
gossamer
in
autumn
when
they
were
not
too
lazy
to
make
their
winter
dresses
they
were
very
fond
of
music
but
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
learn
the
piano
or
the
violin
and
as
for
dancing
that
would
have
been
too
great
an
exertion
so
they
sat
on
all
day
long
and
played
on
the
harp
and
if
the
ants
bit
them
why
they
just
got
up
and
went
to
the
next
till
they
were
bitten
there
likewise
picture
woman
surrounded
by
fairies
and
they
sat
under
the
and
let
the
flapdoodle
drop
into
their
mouths
and
under
the
vines
and
squeezed
the
down
their
throats
and
if
any
little
pigs
ran
about
ready
roasted
crying
and
eat
me
as
was
their
fashion
in
that
country
they
waited
till
the
pigs
ran
against
their
mouths
and
then
took
a
bite
and
were
content
just
as
so
many
oysters
would
have
been
they
needed
no
weapons
for
no
enemies
ever
came
near
their
land
and
no
tools
for
everything
was
readymade
to
their
hand
and
the
stern
old
fairy
necessity
never
came
near
them
to
hunt
them
up
and
make
them
use
their
wits
or
die
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
there
were
never
such
comfortable
people
in
the
world
that
is
a
jolly
life
said
tom
think
so
said
the
fairy
you
see
that
great
peaked
mountain
there
behind
said
the
fairy
smoke
coming
out
of
its
top
do
you
see
all
those
ashes
and
slag
and
cinders
lying
about
turn
over
the
next
five
hundred
years
and
you
will
see
what
happens
and
behold
the
mountain
had
blown
up
like
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
and
then
boiled
over
like
a
kettle
whereby
of
the
doasyoulikes
were
blown
into
the
air
and
another
third
were
smothered
in
ashes
so
that
there
was
only
left
see
said
the
fairy
comes
of
living
on
a
burning
why
did
you
not
warn
them
said
little
ellie
did
warn
them
all
that
i
could
i
let
the
smoke
come
out
of
the
mountain
and
wherever
there
is
smoke
there
is
fire
and
i
laid
the
ashes
and
cinders
all
about
and
wherever
there
are
cinders
cinders
may
be
again
but
they
did
not
like
to
face
facts
my
dears
as
very
few
people
do
and
so
they
invented
a
story
which
i
am
sure
i
never
told
them
that
the
smoke
was
the
breath
of
a
giant
whom
some
gods
or
other
had
buried
under
the
mountain
and
that
the
cinders
were
what
the
dwarfs
roasted
the
little
pigs
whole
with
and
other
nonsense
of
that
kind
and
when
folks
are
in
that
humour
i
can
not
teach
them
save
by
the
good
old
and
then
she
turned
over
the
next
five
hundred
years
and
there
were
the
remnant
of
the
doasyoulikes
doing
as
they
liked
as
before
they
were
too
lazy
to
move
away
from
the
mountain
so
they
said
if
it
has
blown
up
once
that
is
all
the
more
reason
that
it
should
not
blow
up
again
and
they
were
few
in
number
but
they
only
said
the
more
the
merrier
but
the
fewer
the
better
fare
however
that
was
not
quite
true
for
all
the
were
killed
by
the
volcano
and
they
had
eaten
all
the
roast
pigs
who
of
course
could
not
be
expected
to
have
little
ones
so
they
had
to
live
very
hard
on
nuts
and
roots
which
they
scratched
out
of
the
ground
with
sticks
some
of
them
talked
of
sowing
corn
as
their
ancestors
used
to
do
before
they
came
into
the
land
of
readymade
but
they
had
forgotten
how
to
make
ploughs
they
had
forgotten
even
how
to
make
harps
by
this
time
and
had
eaten
all
the
which
they
brought
out
of
the
land
of
hardwork
years
since
and
of
course
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
go
away
and
find
more
so
they
lived
miserably
on
roots
and
nuts
and
all
the
weakly
little
children
had
great
stomachs
and
then
died
said
tom
are
growing
no
better
than
look
how
ugly
they
are
all
getting
said
ellie
when
people
live
on
poor
vegetables
instead
of
roast
beef
and
their
jaws
grow
large
and
their
lips
grow
coarse
like
the
poor
paddies
who
eat
and
she
turned
over
the
next
five
hundred
years
and
there
they
were
all
living
up
in
trees
and
making
nests
to
keep
off
the
rain
and
underneath
the
trees
lions
were
prowling
about
said
ellie
lions
seem
to
have
eaten
a
good
many
of
them
for
there
are
very
few
left
said
the
fairy
see
it
was
only
the
strongest
and
most
active
ones
who
could
climb
the
trees
and
so
what
great
hulking
chaps
they
are
said
tom
are
a
rough
lot
as
ever
i
they
are
getting
very
strong
now
for
the
ladies
will
not
marry
any
but
the
very
strongest
and
fiercest
gentlemen
who
can
help
them
up
the
trees
out
of
the
and
she
turned
over
the
next
five
hundred
years
and
in
that
they
were
fewer
still
and
stronger
and
fiercer
but
their
feet
had
changed
shape
very
oddly
for
they
laid
hold
of
the
branches
with
their
great
toes
as
if
they
had
been
thumbs
just
as
a
hindoo
tailor
uses
his
toes
to
thread
his
needle
the
children
were
very
much
surprised
and
asked
the
fairy
whether
that
was
her
doing
and
no
she
said
smiling
was
only
those
who
could
use
their
feet
as
well
as
their
hands
who
could
get
a
good
living
or
indeed
get
married
so
that
they
got
the
best
of
everything
and
starved
out
all
the
rest
and
those
who
are
left
keep
up
a
regular
breed
of
as
a
breed
of
or
are
or
fancy
pigeons
is
kept
there
is
a
hairy
one
among
them
said
ellie
said
the
fairy
will
be
a
great
man
in
his
time
and
chief
of
all
the
and
when
she
turned
over
the
next
five
hundred
years
it
was
true
for
this
hairy
chief
had
had
hairy
children
and
they
hairier
children
still
and
every
one
wished
to
marry
hairy
husbands
and
have
hairy
children
too
for
the
climate
was
growing
so
damp
that
none
but
the
hairy
ones
could
live
all
the
rest
coughed
and
sneezed
and
had
sore
throats
and
went
into
consumptions
before
they
could
grow
up
to
be
men
and
women
then
the
fairy
turned
over
the
next
five
hundred
years
and
they
were
fewer
still
there
is
one
on
the
ground
picking
up
roots
said
ellie
he
can
not
walk
no
more
he
could
for
in
the
same
way
that
the
shape
of
their
feet
had
altered
the
shape
of
their
backs
had
altered
also
cried
tom
declare
they
are
all
fearfully
like
it
poor
foolish
creatures
said
the
fairy
are
grown
so
stupid
now
that
they
can
hardly
think
for
none
of
them
have
used
their
wits
for
many
hundred
years
they
have
almost
forgotten
too
how
to
talk
for
each
stupid
child
forgot
some
of
the
words
it
heard
from
its
stupid
parents
and
had
not
wits
enough
to
make
fresh
words
for
itself
beside
they
are
grown
so
fierce
and
suspicious
and
brutal
that
they
keep
out
of
each
way
and
mope
and
sulk
in
the
dark
forests
never
hearing
each
voice
till
they
have
forgotten
almost
what
speech
is
like
i
am
afraid
they
will
all
be
apes
very
soon
and
all
by
doing
only
what
they
and
in
the
next
five
hundred
years
they
were
all
dead
and
gone
by
bad
food
and
wild
beasts
and
hunters
all
except
one
tremendous
old
fellow
with
jaws
like
a
jack
who
stood
full
seven
feet
high
and
du
chaillu
came
up
to
him
and
shot
him
as
he
stood
roaring
and
thumping
his
breast
and
he
remembered
that
his
ancestors
had
once
been
men
and
tried
to
say
i
not
a
man
and
a
brother
but
had
forgotten
how
to
use
his
tongue
and
then
he
had
tried
to
call
for
a
doctor
but
he
had
forgotten
the
word
for
one
so
all
he
said
was
and
died
picture
ape
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
great
and
jolly
nation
of
the
doasyoulikes
and
when
tom
and
ellie
came
to
the
end
of
the
book
they
looked
very
sad
and
solemn
and
they
had
good
reason
so
to
do
for
they
really
fancied
that
the
men
were
apes
and
never
thought
in
their
simplicity
of
asking
whether
the
creatures
had
hippopotamus
majors
in
their
brains
or
not
in
which
case
as
you
have
been
told
already
they
could
not
possibly
have
been
apes
though
they
were
more
apish
than
the
apes
of
all
aperies
could
you
not
have
saved
them
from
becoming
apes
said
little
ellie
at
last
first
my
dear
if
only
they
would
have
behaved
like
men
and
set
to
work
to
do
what
they
did
not
like
but
the
longer
they
waited
and
behaved
like
the
dumb
beasts
who
only
do
what
they
like
the
stupider
and
clumsier
they
grew
till
at
last
they
were
past
all
cure
for
they
had
thrown
their
own
wits
away
it
is
such
things
as
this
that
help
to
make
me
so
ugly
that
i
know
not
when
i
shall
grow
where
are
they
all
now
asked
ellie
where
they
ought
to
be
my
said
the
fairy
solemnly
half
to
herself
as
she
closed
the
wonderful
book
say
now
that
i
can
make
beasts
into
men
by
circumstance
and
selection
and
competition
and
so
forth
well
perhaps
they
are
right
and
perhaps
again
they
are
wrong
that
is
one
of
the
seven
things
which
i
am
forbidden
to
tell
till
the
coming
of
the
cocqcigrues
and
at
all
events
it
is
no
concern
of
theirs
whatever
their
ancestors
were
men
they
are
and
i
advise
them
to
behave
as
such
and
act
accordingly
but
let
them
recollect
this
that
there
are
two
sides
to
every
question
and
a
downhill
as
well
as
an
uphill
road
and
if
i
can
turn
beasts
into
men
i
can
by
the
same
laws
of
circumstance
and
selection
and
competition
turn
men
into
beasts
you
were
very
near
being
turned
into
a
beast
once
or
twice
little
tom
indeed
if
you
had
not
made
up
your
mind
to
go
on
this
journey
and
see
the
world
like
an
englishman
i
am
not
sure
but
that
you
would
have
ended
as
an
eft
in
a
dear
me
said
tom
than
that
and
be
all
over

minute
if
it

vii

the
old
nurse
took
the
child
upon
her
knee
saying
is
a
story
book
thy
father
hath
written
for
thee
wander
with
me
she
said
regions
yet
untrod
and
read
what
is
still
unread
in
the
manuscripts
of
he
wandered
away
and
away
with
nature
the
dear
old
nurse
who
sang
to
him
night
and
day
the
rhymes
of
the
longfellow
picture
tom
about
to
dive
said
tom
am
ready
be
off
if
to
the
said
the
fairy
is
a
brave
good
boy
but
you
must
go
farther
than
the
end
if
you
want
to
find
grimes
for
he
is
at
the
you
must
go
to
shiny
wall
and
through
the
white
gate
that
never
was
opened
and
then
you
will
come
to
peacepool
and
mother
haven
where
the
good
whales
go
when
they
die
and
there
mother
carey
will
tell
you
the
way
to
the
and
there
you
will
find
dear
said
tom
i
do
not
know
my
way
to
shiny
wall
or
where
it
is
at
boys
must
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
things
for
themselves
or
they
will
never
grow
to
be
men
so
that
you
must
ask
all
the
beasts
in
the
sea
and
the
birds
in
the
air
and
if
you
have
been
good
to
them
some
of
them
will
tell
you
the
way
to
shiny
said
tom
will
be
a
long
journey
so
i
had
better
start
at
once
miss
ellie
you
know
i
am
getting
a
big
boy
and
i
must
go
out
and
see
the
know
you
must
said
ellie
you
will
not
forget
me
tom
i
shall
wait
here
till
you
and
she
shook
hands
with
him
and
bade
him
tom
longed
very
much
again
to
kiss
her
but
he
thought
it
would
not
be
respectful
considering
she
was
a
lady
born
so
he
promised
not
to
forget
her
but
his
little
of
a
head
was
so
full
of
the
notion
of
going
out
to
see
the
world
that
it
forgot
her
in
five
minutes
however
though
his
head
forgot
her
i
am
glad
to
say
his
heart
did
not
so
he
asked
all
the
beasts
in
the
sea
and
all
the
birds
in
the
air
but
none
of
them
knew
the
way
to
shiny
wall
for
why
he
was
still
too
far
down
south
then
he
met
a
ship
far
larger
than
he
had
ever
gallant
with
a
long
cloud
of
smoke
trailing
behind
and
he
wondered
how
she
went
on
without
sails
and
swam
up
to
her
to
see
a
school
of
dolphins
were
running
races
round
and
round
her
going
three
feet
for
her
one
and
tom
asked
them
the
way
to
shiny
wall
but
they
did
not
know
then
he
tried
to
find
out
how
she
moved
and
at
last
he
saw
her
screw
and
was
so
delighted
with
it
that
he
played
under
her
quarter
all
day
till
he
nearly
had
his
nose
knocked
off
by
the
fans
and
thought
it
time
to
move
then
he
watched
the
sailors
upon
deck
and
the
ladies
with
their
bonnets
and
parasols
but
none
of
them
could
see
him
because
their
eyes
were
not
opened
indeed
most
eyes
are
not
at
last
there
came
out
into
the
a
very
pretty
lady
in
deep
black
weeds
and
in
her
arms
a
baby
she
leaned
over
the
and
looked
back
and
back
toward
england
far
away
and
as
she
looked
she
sang
i
soft
out
the
sweet
south
thy
silver
athwart
the
summer
thin
threads
of
mist
on
dewy
fingers
a
veil
of
dappled
gauze
to
shade
my
babe
and
ii
deep
thine
own
abyss
thyself
earth
and
air
and
weary
hearts
within
thy
holy
temple
from
shame
my
helpless
babe
and
her
voice
was
so
soft
and
low
and
the
music
of
the
air
so
sweet
that
tom
could
have
listened
to
it
all
day
but
as
she
held
the
baby
over
the
gallery
rail
to
show
it
the
dolphins
leaping
and
the
water
gurgling
in
the
wake
lo
and
behold
the
baby
saw
tom
picture
the
lady
he
was
quite
sure
of
that
for
when
their
eyes
met
the
baby
smiled
and
held
out
his
hands
and
tom
smiled
and
held
out
his
hands
too
and
the
baby
kicked
and
leaped
as
if
it
wanted
to
jump
overboard
to
him
do
you
see
my
darling
said
the
lady
and
her
eyes
followed
the
till
she
too
caught
sight
of
tom
swimming
about
among
the
below
she
gave
a
little
shriek
and
start
and
then
she
said
quite
quietly
in
the
sea
well
perhaps
it
is
the
happiest
place
for
them
and
waved
her
hand
to
tom
and
cried
a
little
darling
only
a
little
and
perhaps
we
shall
go
with
you
and
be
at
and
at
that
an
old
nurse
all
in
black
came
out
and
talked
to
her
and
drew
her
in
and
tom
turned
away
northward
sad
and
wondering
and
watched
the
great
steamer
slide
away
into
the
dusk
and
the
lights
on
board
peep
out
one
by
one
and
die
out
again
and
the
long
bar
of
smoke
fade
away
into
the
evening
mist
till
all
was
out
of
sight
and
he
swam
northward
again
day
after
day
till
at
last
he
met
the
king
of
the
herrings
with
a
growing
out
of
his
nose
and
a
sprat
in
his
mouth
for
a
cigar
and
asked
him
the
way
to
shiny
wall
so
he
bolted
his
sprat
head
foremost
and
said
i
were
you
young
gentleman
i
should
go
to
the
allalonestone
and
ask
the
last
of
the
gairfowl
she
is
of
a
very
ancient
clan
very
nearly
as
ancient
as
my
own
and
knows
a
good
deal
which
these
modern
upstarts
as
ladies
of
old
houses
are
likely
to
picture
the
king
of
the
herrings
tom
asked
his
way
to
her
and
the
king
of
the
herrings
told
him
very
kindly
for
he
was
a
courteous
old
gentleman
of
the
old
school
though
he
was
horribly
ugly
and
strangely
bedizened
too
like
the
old
dandies
who
lounge
in
the
windows
but
just
as
tom
had
thanked
him
and
set
off
he
called
after
him
i
say
can
you
fly
never
tried
says
tom
if
you
can
i
should
advise
you
to
say
nothing
to
the
old
lady
about
it
there
take
a
hint
and
away
tom
went
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
due
till
he
came
to
a
great
codbank
the
like
of
which
he
never
saw
before
the
great
cod
lay
below
in
tens
of
thousands
and
gobbled
all
day
long
and
the
blue
sharks
roved
above
in
hundreds
and
gobbled
them
when
they
came
up
so
they
ate
and
ate
and
ate
each
other
as
they
had
done
since
the
making
of
the
world
for
no
man
had
come
here
yet
to
catch
them
and
find
out
how
rich
old
mother
carey
is
picture
the
gairfowl
and
there
he
saw
the
last
of
the
gairfowl
standing
up
on
the
allalonestones
all
alone
and
a
very
grand
old
lady
she
was
full
three
feet
high
and
bolt
upright
like
some
old
highland
chieftainess
she
had
on
a
black
velvet
gown
and
a
white
pinner
and
apron
and
a
very
high
bridge
to
her
nose
which
is
a
sure
mark
of
high
breeding
and
a
large
pair
of
white
spectacles
on
it
which
made
her
look
rather
odd
but
it
was
the
ancient
fashion
of
her
house
and
instead
of
wings
she
had
two
little
feathery
arms
with
which
she
fanned
herself
and
complained
of
the
dreadful
heat
and
she
kept
on
crooning
an
old
song
to
herself
which
she
learnt
when
she
was
a
little
long
little
birds
they
sat
on
a
swam
then
there
was
a
other
swam
then
there
was
so
the
poor
stone
was
left
all
a
it
was
away
properly
and
not
away
but
as
she
could
not
fly
she
had
a
right
to
alter
it
however
it
was
a
very
fit
song
for
her
to
sing
because
she
was
a
lady
herself
tom
came
up
to
her
very
humbly
and
made
his
bow
and
the
first
thing
she
said
you
wings
can
you
fly
dear
no
i
should
not
think
of
such
thing
said
cunning
little
tom
i
shall
have
great
pleasure
in
talking
to
you
my
dear
it
is
quite
refreshing
nowadays
to
see
anything
without
wings
they
must
all
have
wings
forsooth
now
every
new
upstart
sort
of
bird
and
fly
what
can
they
want
with
flying
and
raising
themselves
above
their
proper
station
in
life
in
the
days
of
my
ancestors
no
birds
ever
thought
of
having
wings
and
did
very
well
without
and
now
they
all
laugh
at
me
because
i
keep
to
the
good
old
fashion
why
the
very
marrocks
and
dovekies
have
got
wings
the
vulgar
creatures
and
poor
little
ones
enough
they
are
and
my
own
cousins
too
the
who
are
gentlefolk
born
and
ought
to
know
better
than
to
ape
their
and
so
she
was
running
on
while
tom
tried
to
get
in
a
word
edgeways
and
at
last
he
did
when
the
old
lady
got
out
of
breath
and
began
fanning
herself
again
and
then
he
asked
if
she
knew
the
way
to
shiny
wall
wall
who
should
know
better
than
i
we
all
came
from
shiny
wall
thousands
of
years
ago
when
it
was
decently
cold
and
the
climate
was
fit
for
gentlefolk
but
now
what
with
the
heat
and
what
with
these
things
who
fly
up
and
down
and
eat
everything
so
that
hunting
is
all
spoilt
and
one
really
can
not
get
living
or
hardly
venture
off
the
rock
for
fear
of
being
flown
against
by
some
creature
that
would
not
have
dared
to
come
within
a
mile
of
one
a
thousand
years
was
i
saying
why
we
have
quite
gone
down
in
the
world
my
dear
and
have
nothing
left
but
our
honour
and
i
am
the
last
of
my
family
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
came
and
settled
on
this
rock
when
we
were
young
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
low
people
once
we
were
a
great
nation
and
spread
over
all
the
northern
isles
but
men
shot
us
so
and
knocked
us
on
the
head
and
took
our
if
you
will
believe
it
they
say
that
on
the
coast
of
labrador
the
sailors
used
to
lay
a
plank
from
the
rock
on
board
the
thing
called
their
ship
and
drive
us
along
the
plank
by
hundreds
till
we
tumbled
down
into
the
waist
in
heaps
and
then
i
suppose
they
ate
us
the
nasty
fellows
was
i
saying
at
last
there
were
none
of
us
left
except
on
the
old
gairfowlskerry
just
off
the
iceland
coast
up
which
no
man
could
climb
even
there
we
had
no
peace
for
one
day
when
i
was
quite
a
young
girl
the
land
rocked
and
the
sea
boiled
and
the
sky
grew
dark
and
all
the
air
was
filled
with
smoke
and
dust
and
down
tumbled
the
old
gairfowlskerry
into
the
sea
the
dovekies
and
marrocks
of
course
all
flew
away
but
we
were
too
proud
to
do
that
some
of
us
were
dashed
to
pieces
and
some
drowned
and
those
who
were
left
got
away
to
eldey
and
the
dovekies
tell
me
they
are
all
dead
now
and
that
another
gairfowlskerry
has
risen
out
of
the
sea
close
to
the
old
one
but
that
it
is
such
a
poor
flat
place
that
it
is
not
safe
to
live
on
and
so
here
i
am
left
this
was
the
story
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
it
is
every
word
of
it
true
you
only
had
had
wings
said
tom
you
might
all
have
flown
away
young
gentleman
and
if
people
are
not
gentleman
and
ladies
and
forget
that
they
will
find
it
as
easy
to
get
on
in
the
world
as
other
people
who
care
what
they
do
why
if
i
had
not
recollected
that
i
should
not
have
been
all
alone
and
the
poor
old
lady
sighed
was
that
my
dear
a
gentleman
came
hither
with
me
and
after
we
had
been
here
some
time
he
wanted
to
fact
he
actually
proposed
to
me
well
i
blame
him
i
was
young
and
very
handsome
then
i
deny
but
you
see
i
could
not
hear
of
such
a
thing
because
he
was
my
deceased
husband
you
see
course
not
said
tom
though
of
course
he
knew
nothing
about
it
was
very
much
diseased
i
suppose
do
not
understand
me
my
dear
i
mean
that
being
a
lady
and
with
right
and
honourable
feelings
as
our
house
always
has
had
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
snub
him
and
howk
him
and
peck
him
continually
to
keep
him
at
his
proper
distance
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
once
pecked
him
a
little
too
hard
poor
fellow
and
he
tumbled
backwards
off
the
rock
it
was
very
unfortunate
but
it
was
not
my
shark
coming
by
saw
him
flapping
and
snapped
him
up
and
since
then
i
have
lived
all
a
and
soon
i
shall
be
gone
my
little
dear
and
nobody
will
miss
me
and
then
the
poor
stone
will
be
left
all
please
which
is
the
way
to
shiny
wall
said
tom
you
must
go
my
little
must
go
let
me
am
my
poor
old
brains
are
getting
quite
puzzled
do
you
know
my
little
dear
i
am
afraid
if
you
want
to
know
you
must
ask
some
of
these
vulgar
birds
about
for
i
have
quite
and
the
poor
old
gairfowl
began
to
cry
tears
of
pure
oil
and
tom
was
quite
sorry
for
her
and
for
himself
too
for
he
was
at
his
end
whom
to
ask
but
by
there
came
a
flock
of
petrels
who
are
mother
own
chickens
and
tom
thought
them
much
prettier
than
lady
gairfowl
and
so
perhaps
they
were
for
mother
carey
had
had
a
great
deal
of
fresh
experience
between
the
time
that
she
invented
the
gairfowl
and
the
time
that
she
invented
them
they
flitted
along
like
a
flock
of
black
swallows
and
hopped
and
skipped
from
wave
to
wave
lifting
up
their
little
feet
behind
them
so
daintily
and
whistling
to
each
other
so
tenderly
that
tom
fell
in
love
with
them
at
once
and
called
them
to
know
the
way
to
shiny
wall
wall
do
you
want
shiny
wall
then
come
with
us
and
we
will
show
you
we
are
mother
own
chickens
and
she
sends
us
out
over
all
the
seas
to
show
the
good
birds
the
way
tom
was
delighted
and
swam
off
to
them
after
he
had
made
his
bow
to
the
gairfowl
but
she
would
not
return
his
bow
but
held
herself
bolt
upright
and
wept
tears
of
oil
as
she
sang
so
the
poor
stone
was
left
all
a
but
she
was
wrong
there
for
the
stone
was
not
left
all
alone
and
the
next
time
that
tom
goes
by
it
he
will
see
a
sight
worth
seeing
the
old
gairfowl
is
gone
already
but
there
are
better
things
come
in
her
place
and
when
tom
comes
he
will
see
the
anchored
there
in
hundreds
from
scotland
and
from
ireland
and
from
the
orkneys
and
the
shetlands
and
from
all
the
northern
ports
full
of
the
children
of
the
old
norse
vikings
the
masters
of
the
sea
and
the
men
will
be
hauling
in
the
great
cod
by
thousands
till
their
hands
are
sore
from
the
lines
and
they
will
be
making
oil
and
guano
and
salting
down
the
fish
and
there
will
be
a
steamer
there
to
protect
them
and
a
lighthouse
to
show
them
the
way
and
you
and
i
perhaps
shall
go
some
day
to
the
allalonestone
to
the
great
summer
and
dredge
strange
creatures
such
as
man
never
saw
before
and
we
shall
hear
the
sailors
boast
that
it
is
not
the
worst
jewel
in
queen
crown
for
there
are
eighty
miles
of
codbank
and
food
for
all
the
poor
folk
in
the
land
that
is
what
tom
will
see
and
perhaps
you
and
i
shall
see
it
too
and
then
we
shall
not
be
sorry
because
we
can
not
get
a
gairfowl
to
stuff
much
less
find
gairfowl
enough
to
drive
them
into
stone
pens
and
slaughter
them
as
the
old
norsemen
did
or
drive
them
on
board
along
a
plank
till
the
ship
was
victualled
with
them
as
the
old
english
and
french
rovers
used
to
do
of
whom
dear
old
hakluyt
tells
but
we
shall
remember
what
tennyson
says
how
old
order
place
to
the
god
fulfils
himself
in
many
and
now
tom
was
all
agog
to
start
for
shiny
wall
but
the
petrels
said
no
they
must
go
first
to
allfowlsness
and
wait
there
for
the
great
gathering
of
all
the
before
they
start
for
their
summer
far
away
in
the
northern
isles
and
there
they
would
be
sure
to
find
some
birds
which
were
going
to
shiny
wall
but
where
allfowlsness
was
he
must
promise
never
to
tell
lest
men
should
go
there
and
shoot
the
birds
and
stuff
them
and
put
them
into
stupid
museums
instead
of
leaving
them
to
play
and
breed
and
work
in
mother
where
they
ought
to
be
so
where
allfowlsness
is
nobody
must
know
and
all
that
is
to
be
said
about
it
is
that
tom
waited
there
many
days
and
as
he
waited
he
saw
a
very
curious
sight
on
the
rabbit
burrows
on
the
shore
there
gathered
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
such
as
you
see
in
cambridgeshire
and
they
made
such
a
noise
that
tom
came
on
shore
and
went
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
picture
crows
and
there
he
found
them
holding
their
great
caucus
which
they
hold
every
year
in
the
north
and
all
their
were
speechifying
and
for
a
tribune
the
speaker
stood
on
an
old
skull
and
they
cawed
and
cawed
and
boasted
of
all
the
clever
things
they
had
done
how
many
eyes
they
had
picked
out
and
how
many
dead
bullocks
they
had
eaten
and
how
many
young
grouse
they
had
swallowed
whole
and
how
many
they
had
flown
away
with
stuck
on
the
point
of
their
bills
which
is
the
particularly
clever
feat
of
which
he
is
as
proud
as
a
gipsy
is
of
doing
the
and
what
that
is
i
tell
you
and
at
last
they
brought
out
the
prettiest
neatest
young
that
ever
was
seen
and
set
her
in
the
middle
and
all
began
abusing
and
vilifying
and
rating
and
bullyragging
at
her
because
she
had
stolen
no
and
had
actually
dared
to
say
that
she
would
not
steal
any
so
she
was
to
be
tried
publicly
by
their
laws
for
the
hoodies
always
try
some
offenders
in
their
great
yearly
parliament
and
there
she
stood
in
the
middle
in
her
black
gown
and
gray
hood
looking
as
meek
and
as
neat
as
a
quakeress
and
they
all
bawled
at
her
at
and
it
was
in
vain
that
she
she
did
not
like
she
could
get
her
living
very
well
without
she
was
afraid
to
eat
fear
of
the
she
had
not
the
heart
to
eat
the
grouse
were
such
a
dozen
reasons
for
all
the
other
set
upon
her
and
pecked
her
to
death
there
and
then
before
tom
could
come
to
help
her
and
then
flew
away
very
proud
of
what
they
had
done
now
was
not
this
a
scandalous
transaction
but
they
are
true
republicans
these
hoodies
who
do
every
one
just
what
he
likes
and
make
other
people
do
so
too
so
that
for
any
freedom
of
speech
thought
or
action
which
is
allowed
among
them
they
might
as
well
be
american
citizens
of
the
new
school
but
the
fairies
took
the
good
crow
and
gave
her
nine
new
sets
of
feathers
running
and
turned
her
at
last
into
the
most
beautiful
bird
of
paradise
with
a
green
velvet
suit
and
a
long
tail
and
sent
her
to
eat
fruit
in
the
spice
islands
where
cloves
and
nutmegs
grow
and
bedonebyasyoudid
settled
her
account
with
the
wicked
hoodies
for
as
they
flew
away
what
should
they
find
but
a
nasty
dead
dog
which
they
all
set
to
work
peeking
and
gobbling
and
cawing
and
quarrelling
to
their
content
but
the
moment
afterwards
they
all
threw
up
their
bills
into
the
air
and
gave
one
screech
and
then
turned
head
over
heels
backward
and
fell
down
dead
one
hundred
and
of
them
at
once
for
why
the
fairy
had
told
the
gamekeeper
in
a
dream
to
fill
the
dead
dog
full
of
strychnine
and
so
he
did
and
after
a
while
the
birds
began
to
gather
at
allfowlsness
in
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
blackening
all
the
air
swans
and
brant
geese
harlequins
and
eiders
harolds
and
garganeys
smews
and
goosanders
divers
and
loons
grebes
and
dovekies
auks
and
gannets
and
petrels
skuas
and
terns
with
gulls
beyond
all
naming
or
numbering
and
they
paddled
and
washed
and
splashed
and
combed
and
brushed
themselves
on
the
sand
till
the
shore
was
white
with
feathers
and
they
quacked
and
clucked
and
gabbled
and
chattered
and
screamed
and
whooped
as
they
talked
over
matters
with
their
friends
and
settled
where
they
were
to
go
and
breed
that
summer
till
you
might
have
heard
them
ten
miles
off
and
lucky
it
was
for
them
that
there
was
no
one
to
hear
them
but
the
old
keeper
who
lived
all
alone
upon
the
ness
in
a
turf
hut
thatched
with
heather
and
fringed
round
with
great
stones
slung
across
the
roof
by
lest
the
winter
gales
should
blow
the
hut
right
away
but
he
never
minded
the
birds
nor
hurt
them
because
they
were
not
in
season
indeed
he
minded
but
two
things
in
the
whole
world
and
those
were
his
bible
and
his
grouse
for
he
was
as
good
an
old
scotchman
as
ever
knit
stockings
on
a
night
only
when
all
the
birds
were
going
he
toddled
out
and
took
off
his
cap
to
them
and
wished
them
a
merry
journey
and
a
safe
return
and
then
gathered
up
all
the
feathers
which
they
had
left
and
cleaned
them
to
sell
down
south
and
make
for
stuffy
people
to
lie
on
picture
the
scotchman
then
the
petrels
asked
this
bird
and
that
whether
they
would
take
tom
to
shiny
wall
but
one
set
was
going
to
sutherland
and
one
to
the
shetlands
and
one
to
norway
and
one
to
spitzbergen
and
one
to
iceland
and
one
to
greenland
but
none
would
go
to
shiny
wall
so
the
petrels
said
that
they
would
show
him
part
of
the
way
themselves
but
they
were
only
going
as
far
as
jan
land
and
after
that
he
must
shift
for
himself
and
then
all
the
birds
rose
up
and
streamed
away
in
long
black
lines
north
and
and
across
the
bright
blue
summer
sky
and
their
cry
was
like
ten
thousand
packs
of
hounds
and
ten
thousand
peals
of
bells
only
the
puffins
stayed
behind
and
killed
the
young
rabbits
and
laid
their
eggs
in
the
which
was
rough
practice
certainly
but
a
man
must
see
to
his
own
family
and
as
tom
and
the
petrels
went
it
began
to
blow
right
hard
for
the
old
gentleman
in
the
gray
who
looks
after
the
big
copper
boiler
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
had
got
behindhand
with
his
work
so
mother
carey
had
sent
an
electric
message
to
him
for
more
steam
and
now
the
steam
was
coming
as
much
in
an
hour
as
ought
to
have
come
in
a
week
puffing
and
roaring
and
swishing
and
swirling
till
you
could
not
see
where
the
sky
ended
and
the
sea
began
but
tom
and
the
petrels
never
cared
for
the
gale
was
right
abaft
and
away
they
went
over
the
crests
of
the
billows
as
merry
as
so
many
and
at
last
they
saw
an
ugly
black
side
of
a
great
ship
waterlogged
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
her
funnel
and
her
masts
were
overboard
and
swayed
and
surged
under
her
lee
her
decks
were
swept
as
clean
as
a
barn
floor
and
there
was
no
living
soul
on
board
the
petrels
flew
up
to
her
and
wailed
round
her
for
they
were
very
sorry
indeed
and
also
they
expected
to
find
some
salt
pork
and
tom
scrambled
on
board
of
her
and
looked
round
frightened
and
sad
and
there
in
a
little
cot
lashed
tight
under
the
bulwark
lay
a
baby
fast
asleep
the
very
same
baby
tom
saw
at
once
which
he
had
seen
in
the
singing
arms
he
went
up
to
it
and
wanted
to
wake
it
but
behold
from
under
the
cot
out
jumped
a
little
black
and
tan
terrier
dog
and
began
barking
and
snapping
at
tom
and
would
not
let
him
touch
the
cot
tom
knew
the
teeth
could
not
hurt
him
but
at
least
it
could
shove
him
away
and
did
and
he
and
the
dog
fought
and
struggled
for
he
wanted
to
help
the
baby
and
did
not
want
to
throw
the
poor
dog
overboard
but
as
they
were
struggling
there
came
a
tall
green
sea
and
walked
in
over
the
weather
side
of
the
ship
and
swept
them
all
into
the
waves
the
baby
the
baby
screamed
tom
but
the
next
moment
he
did
not
scream
at
all
for
he
saw
the
cot
settling
down
through
the
green
water
with
the
baby
smiling
in
it
fast
asleep
and
he
saw
the
fairies
come
up
from
below
and
carry
baby
and
cradle
gently
down
in
their
soft
arms
and
then
he
knew
it
was
all
right
and
that
there
would
be
a
new
in
isle
and
the
poor
little
dog
picture
the
dog
why
after
he
had
kicked
and
coughed
a
little
he
sneezed
so
hard
that
he
sneezed
himself
clean
out
of
his
skin
and
turned
into
a
and
jumped
and
danced
round
tom
and
ran
over
the
crests
of
the
waves
and
snapped
at
the
and
the
mackerel
and
followed
tom
the
whole
way
to
the
then
they
went
on
again
till
they
began
to
see
the
peak
of
jan
land
like
a
white
two
miles
above
the
clouds
and
there
they
fell
in
with
a
whole
flock
of
who
were
feeding
on
a
dead
whale
are
the
fellows
to
show
you
the
way
said
mother
chickens
can
not
help
you
farther
north
we
like
to
get
among
the
ice
pack
for
fear
it
should
nip
our
toes
but
the
mollys
dare
fly
picture
mother
chickens
so
the
petrels
called
to
the
mollys
but
they
were
so
busy
and
greedy
gobbling
and
peeking
and
spluttering
and
fighting
over
the
blubber
that
they
did
not
take
the
least
notice
come
said
the
petrels
lazy
greedy
lubbers
this
young
gentleman
is
going
to
mother
carey
and
if
you
attend
on
him
you
earn
your
discharge
from
her
you
we
are
says
a
great
fat
old
molly
lazy
we
and
as
for
lubbers
no
more
lubbers
than
you
have
a
look
at
the
and
he
flapped
right
into
face
and
stared
at
him
in
the
most
impudent
way
for
the
mollys
are
audacious
fellows
as
all
whalers
know
and
then
asked
him
where
he
hailed
from
and
what
land
he
sighted
last
and
when
tom
told
him
he
seemed
pleased
and
said
he
was
a
good
plucked
one
to
have
got
so
far
along
lads
he
said
to
the
rest
give
this
little
chap
a
cast
over
the
pack
for
mother
sake
eaten
blubber
enough
for
and
work
out
a
bit
of
our
time
by
helping
the
so
the
mollys
took
tom
up
on
their
backs
and
flew
off
with
him
laughing
and
oh
how
they
did
smell
of
train
oil
are
you
you
jolly
birds
asked
tom
are
the
spirits
of
the
old
greenland
skippers
as
every
sailor
knows
who
hunted
here
right
whales
and
full
hundreds
of
years
agone
but
because
we
were
saucy
and
greedy
we
were
all
turned
into
mollys
to
eat
blubber
all
our
days
but
lubbers
we
are
none
and
could
sail
a
ship
now
against
any
man
in
the
north
seas
though
we
hold
with
this
steam
and
a
shame
of
those
black
imps
of
petrels
to
call
us
so
but
because
her
pets
they
think
they
may
say
anything
they
who
are
you
asked
tom
of
him
for
he
saw
that
he
was
the
king
of
all
the
birds
name
is
hendrick
hudson
and
a
right
good
skipper
was
i
and
my
name
will
last
to
the
end
in
spite
of
all
the
wrong
i
did
for
i
discovered
hudson
river
and
i
named
bay
and
many
have
come
in
my
wake
that
dared
not
have
shown
me
the
way
but
i
was
a
hard
man
in
my
time
truth
and
stole
the
poor
indians
off
the
coast
of
maine
and
sold
them
for
slaves
down
in
virginia
and
at
last
i
was
so
cruel
to
my
sailors
here
in
these
very
seas
that
they
set
me
adrift
in
an
open
boat
and
i
never
was
heard
of
more
so
now
the
king
of
all
mollys
till
worked
out
my
and
now
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
pack
and
beyond
it
they
could
see
shiny
wall
looming
through
mist
and
snow
and
storm
but
the
pack
rolled
horribly
upon
the
swell
and
the
ice
giants
fought
and
roared
and
leapt
upon
each
backs
and
ground
each
other
to
powder
so
that
tom
was
afraid
to
venture
among
them
lest
he
should
be
ground
to
powder
too
and
he
was
the
more
afraid
when
he
saw
lying
among
the
ice
pack
the
wrecks
of
many
a
gallant
ship
some
with
masts
and
yards
all
standing
some
with
the
seamen
frozen
fast
on
board
alas
alas
for
them
they
were
all
true
english
hearts
and
they
came
to
their
end
like
good
in
searching
for
the
white
gate
that
never
was
opened
yet
but
the
good
mollys
took
tom
and
his
dog
up
and
flew
with
them
safe
over
the
pack
and
the
roaring
ice
giants
and
set
them
down
at
the
foot
of
shiny
wall
where
is
the
gate
asked
tom
is
no
gate
said
the
mollys
gate
cried
tom
aghast
never
a
crack
of
one
and
the
whole
of
the
secret
as
better
fellows
lad
than
you
have
found
to
their
cost
and
if
there
had
been
have
killed
by
now
every
right
whale
that
swims
the
am
i
to
do
then
under
the
floe
to
be
sure
if
you
have
not
come
so
far
to
turn
now
said
tom
here
goes
for
a
lucky
voyage
to
you
lad
said
the
mollys
knew
you
were
one
of
the
right
sort
so
you
come
too
asked
tom
but
the
mollys
only
wailed
sadly
go
yet
we
go
yet
and
flew
away
over
the
pack
so
tom
dived
under
the
great
white
gate
which
never
was
opened
yet
and
went
on
in
black
darkness
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
and
yet
he
was
not
a
bit
frightened
why
should
he
be
he
was
a
brave
english
lad
whose
business
is
to
go
out
and
see
all
the
world
and
at
last
he
saw
the
light
and
clear
clear
water
overhead
and
up
he
came
a
thousand
fathoms
among
clouds
of
which
fluttered
round
his
head
there
were
moths
with
pink
heads
and
wings
and
opal
bodies
that
flapped
about
slowly
moths
with
brown
wings
that
flapped
about
quickly
yellow
shrimps
that
hopped
and
skipped
most
quickly
of
all
and
jellies
of
all
the
colours
in
the
world
that
neither
hopped
nor
skipped
but
only
dawdled
and
yawned
and
would
not
get
out
of
his
way
the
dog
snapped
at
them
till
his
jaws
were
tired
but
tom
hardly
minded
them
at
all
he
was
so
eager
to
get
to
the
top
of
the
water
and
see
the
pool
where
the
good
whales
go
and
a
very
large
pool
it
was
miles
and
miles
across
though
the
air
was
so
clear
that
the
ice
cliffs
on
the
opposite
side
looked
as
if
they
were
close
at
hand
all
round
it
the
ice
cliffs
rose
in
walls
and
spires
and
battlements
and
caves
and
bridges
and
stories
and
galleries
in
which
the
live
and
drive
away
the
storms
and
clouds
that
mother
pool
may
lie
calm
from
end
to
end
and
the
sun
acted
policeman
and
walked
round
outside
every
day
peeping
just
over
the
top
of
the
ice
wall
to
see
that
all
went
right
and
now
and
then
he
played
conjuring
tricks
or
had
an
exhibition
of
fireworks
to
amuse
the
for
he
would
make
himself
into
four
or
five
suns
at
once
or
paint
the
sky
with
rings
and
crosses
and
crescents
of
white
fire
and
stick
himself
in
the
middle
of
them
and
wink
at
the
fairies
and
i
daresay
they
were
very
much
amused
for
fun
in
the
country
and
there
the
good
whales
lay
the
happy
sleepy
beasts
upon
the
still
oily
sea
they
were
all
right
whales
you
must
know
and
finners
and
and
and
spotted
with
long
ivory
horns
but
the
sperm
whales
are
such
raging
ramping
roaring
rumbustious
fellows
that
if
mother
carey
let
them
in
there
would
be
no
more
peace
in
peacepool
so
she
packs
them
away
in
a
great
pond
by
themselves
at
the
south
pole
two
hundred
and
miles
of
mount
erebus
the
great
volcano
in
the
ice
and
there
they
butt
each
other
with
their
ugly
noses
day
and
night
from
end
to
end
picture
mother
carey
but
here
there
were
only
good
quiet
beasts
lying
about
like
the
black
hulls
of
sloops
and
blowing
every
now
and
then
jets
of
white
steam
or
sculling
round
with
their
huge
mouths
open
for
the
to
swim
down
their
throats
there
were
no
threshers
there
to
thresh
their
poor
old
backs
or
to
stab
their
stomachs
or
to
rip
them
up
or
to
bite
lumps
out
of
their
sides
or
whalers
to
harpoon
and
lance
them
they
were
quite
safe
and
happy
there
and
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
wait
quietly
in
peacepool
till
mother
carey
sent
for
them
to
make
them
out
of
old
beasts
into
new
tom
swam
up
to
the
nearest
whale
and
asked
the
way
to
mother
carey
she
sits
in
the
middle
said
the
whale
tom
looked
but
he
could
see
nothing
in
the
middle
of
the
pool
but
one
peaked
iceberg
and
he
said
so
mother
carey
said
the
whale
you
will
find
when
you
get
to
her
there
she
sits
making
old
beasts
into
new
all
the
year
does
she
do
that
her
concern
not
mine
said
the
old
whale
and
yawned
so
wide
for
he
was
very
large
that
there
swam
into
his
mouth
no
bigger
than
heads
a
string
of
salpæ
nine
yards
long
and
little
who
gave
each
other
a
parting
pinch
all
round
tucked
their
legs
under
their
stomachs
and
determined
to
die
decently
like
julius
cæsar
suppose
said
tom
cuts
up
a
great
whale
like
you
into
a
whole
shoal
of
porpoises
at
which
the
old
whale
laughed
so
violently
that
he
coughed
up
all
the
creatures
who
swam
away
again
very
thankful
at
having
escaped
out
of
that
terrible
whalebone
net
of
his
from
which
bourne
no
traveller
returns
and
tom
went
on
to
the
iceberg
wondering
and
when
he
came
near
it
it
took
the
form
of
the
grandest
old
lady
he
had
ever
white
marble
lady
sitting
on
a
white
marble
throne
and
from
the
foot
of
the
throne
there
swum
away
out
and
out
into
the
sea
millions
of
creatures
of
more
shapes
and
colours
than
man
ever
dreamed
and
they
were
mother
children
whom
she
makes
out
of
the
all
day
long
picture
mother
carey
he
expected
of
some
grown
people
who
ought
to
know
find
her
snipping
piecing
fitting
stitching
cobbling
basting
filing
planing
hammering
turning
polishing
moulding
measuring
chiselling
clipping
and
so
forth
as
men
do
when
they
go
to
work
to
make
anything
but
instead
of
that
she
sat
quite
still
with
her
chin
upon
her
hand
looking
down
into
the
sea
with
two
great
grand
blue
eyes
as
blue
as
the
sea
itself
her
hair
was
as
white
as
the
she
was
very
very
fact
as
old
as
anything
which
you
are
likely
to
come
across
except
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
and
when
she
saw
tom
she
looked
at
him
very
kindly
do
you
want
my
little
man
it
is
long
since
i
have
seen
a
tom
told
her
his
errand
and
asked
the
way
to
the
ought
to
know
yourself
for
you
have
been
there
i
sure
i
forget
all
about
look
at
and
as
tom
looked
into
her
great
blue
eyes
he
recollected
the
way
perfectly
now
was
not
that
strange
you
said
tom
i
trouble
your
ladyship
any
more
i
hear
you
are
very
am
never
more
busy
than
i
am
now
she
said
without
stirring
a
finger
heard
that
you
were
always
making
new
beasts
out
of
people
fancy
but
i
am
not
going
to
trouble
myself
to
make
things
my
little
dear
i
sit
here
and
make
them
make
are
a
clever
fairy
indeed
thought
tom
and
he
was
quite
right
that
is
a
grand
trick
of
good
old
mother
and
a
grand
answer
which
she
has
had
occasion
to
make
several
times
to
impertinent
people
there
was
once
for
instance
a
fairy
who
was
so
clever
that
she
found
out
how
to
make
butterflies
i
mean
sham
ones
no
but
real
live
ones
which
would
fly
and
eat
and
lay
eggs
and
do
everything
that
they
ought
and
she
was
so
proud
of
her
skill
that
she
went
flying
straight
off
to
the
north
pole
to
boast
to
mother
carey
how
she
could
make
butterflies
but
mother
carey
laughed
silly
child
she
said
any
one
can
make
things
if
they
will
take
time
and
trouble
enough
but
it
is
not
every
one
who
like
me
can
make
things
make
but
people
do
not
yet
believe
that
mother
carey
is
as
clever
as
all
that
comes
to
and
they
will
not
till
they
too
go
the
journey
to
the
now
my
pretty
little
man
said
mother
carey
are
sure
you
know
the
way
to
the
tom
thought
and
behold
he
had
forgotten
it
utterly
is
because
you
took
your
eyes
off
tom
looked
at
her
again
and
recollected
and
then
looked
away
and
forgot
in
an
instant
what
am
i
to
do
for
i
keep
looking
at
you
when
i
am
somewhere
must
do
without
me
as
most
people
have
to
do
for
nine
hundred
and
thousandths
of
their
lives
and
look
at
the
dog
instead
for
he
knows
the
way
well
enough
and
will
not
forget
it
besides
you
may
meet
some
very
people
there
who
will
not
let
you
pass
without
this
passport
of
mine
which
you
must
hang
round
your
neck
and
take
care
of
and
of
course
as
the
dog
will
always
go
behind
you
you
must
go
the
whole
way
cried
tom
i
shall
not
be
able
to
see
my
the
contrary
if
you
look
forward
you
will
not
see
a
step
before
you
and
be
certain
to
go
wrong
but
if
you
look
behind
you
and
watch
carefully
whatever
you
have
passed
and
especially
keep
your
eye
on
the
dog
who
goes
by
instinct
and
therefore
go
wrong
then
you
will
know
what
is
coming
next
as
plainly
as
if
you
saw
it
in
a
tom
was
very
much
astonished
but
he
obeyed
her
for
he
had
learnt
always
to
believe
what
the
fairies
told
him
it
is
my
dear
child
said
mother
carey
i
will
tell
you
a
story
which
will
show
you
that
i
am
perfectly
right
as
it
is
my
custom
to
be
on
a
time
there
were
two
brothers
one
was
called
prometheus
because
he
always
looked
before
him
and
boasted
that
he
was
wise
beforehand
the
other
was
called
epimetheus
because
he
always
looked
behind
him
and
did
not
boast
at
all
but
said
humbly
like
the
irishman
that
he
had
sooner
prophesy
after
the
event
prometheus
was
a
very
clever
fellow
of
course
and
invented
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
but
unfortunately
when
they
were
set
to
work
to
work
was
just
what
they
would
not
do
wherefore
very
little
has
come
of
them
and
very
little
is
left
of
them
and
now
nobody
knows
what
they
were
save
a
few
archæological
old
gentlemen
who
scratch
in
queer
corners
and
find
little
there
save
ptinum
furem
blaptem
mortisagam
acarum
horridum
and
tineam
laciniarum
epimetheus
was
a
very
slow
fellow
certainly
and
went
among
men
for
a
clod
and
a
muff
and
a
milksop
and
a
slowcoach
and
a
bloke
and
a
boodle
and
so
forth
and
very
little
he
did
for
many
years
but
what
he
did
he
never
had
to
do
over
again
what
happened
at
last
there
came
to
the
two
brothers
the
most
beautiful
creature
that
ever
was
seen
pandora
by
name
which
means
all
the
gifts
of
the
gods
but
because
she
had
a
strange
box
in
her
hand
this
fanciful
forecasting
suspicious
prudential
theoretical
deductive
prophesying
prometheus
who
was
always
settling
what
was
going
to
happen
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
pretty
pandora
and
her
box
epimetheus
took
her
and
it
as
he
took
everything
that
came
and
married
her
for
better
for
worse
as
every
man
ought
whenever
he
has
even
the
chance
of
a
good
wife
and
they
opened
the
box
between
them
of
course
to
see
what
was
inside
for
else
of
what
possible
use
could
it
have
been
to
them
out
flew
all
the
ills
which
flesh
is
heir
to
all
the
children
of
the
four
great
bogies
ignorance
fear
and
instance
of
boys
and
but
one
thing
remained
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
and
that
was
hope
epimetheus
got
a
great
deal
of
trouble
as
most
men
do
in
this
world
but
he
got
the
three
best
things
in
the
world
into
the
good
wife
and
experience
and
hope
while
prometheus
had
just
as
much
trouble
and
a
great
deal
more
as
you
will
hear
of
his
own
making
with
nothing
beside
save
fancies
spun
out
of
his
own
brain
as
a
spider
spins
her
web
out
of
her
stomach
prometheus
kept
on
looking
before
him
so
far
ahead
that
as
he
was
running
about
with
a
box
of
lucifers
which
were
the
only
useful
things
he
ever
invented
and
do
as
much
harm
as
good
he
trod
on
his
own
nose
and
tumbled
down
as
most
deductive
philosophers
do
whereby
he
set
the
thames
on
fire
and
they
have
hardly
put
it
out
again
yet
so
he
had
to
be
chained
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
with
a
vulture
by
him
to
give
him
a
peck
whenever
he
stirred
lest
he
should
turn
the
whole
world
upside
down
with
his
prophecies
and
his
theories
stupid
old
epimetheus
went
working
and
grubbing
on
with
the
help
of
his
wife
pandora
always
looking
behind
him
to
see
what
had
happened
till
he
really
learnt
to
know
now
and
then
what
would
happen
next
and
understood
so
well
which
side
his
bread
was
buttered
and
which
way
the
cat
jumped
that
he
began
to
make
things
which
would
work
and
go
on
working
too
to
till
and
drain
the
ground
and
to
make
looms
and
ships
and
railroads
and
steam
ploughs
and
electric
telegraphs
and
all
the
things
which
you
see
in
the
great
exhibition
and
to
foretell
famine
and
bad
weather
and
the
price
of
stocks
and
what
is
hardest
of
all
the
next
vagary
of
the
great
idol
whirligig
which
some
call
public
opinion
till
at
last
he
grew
as
rich
as
a
jew
and
as
fat
as
a
farmer
and
people
thought
twice
before
they
meddled
with
him
but
only
once
before
they
asked
him
to
help
them
for
because
he
earned
his
money
well
he
could
afford
to
spend
it
well
likewise
his
children
are
the
men
of
science
who
get
good
lasting
work
done
in
the
world
but
the
children
of
prometheus
are
the
fanatics
and
the
theorists
and
the
bigots
and
the
bores
and
the
noisy
windy
people
who
go
telling
silly
folk
what
will
happen
instead
of
looking
to
see
what
has
happened
now
was
not
mother
a
wonderful
story
and
i
am
happy
to
say
tom
believed
it
every
word
picture
old
mother

for
so
it
happened
to
tom
likewise
he
was
very
sorely
tried
for
though
by
keeping
the
dog
to
heels
or
rather
to
toes
for
he
had
to
walk
backward
he
could
see
pretty
well
which
way
the
dog
was
hunting
yet
it
was
much
slower
work
to
go
backwards
than
to
go
forwards
but
what
was
more
trying
still
no
sooner
had
he
got
out
of
peacepool
than
there
came
running
to
him
all
the
conjurors
astrologers
prophesiers
projectors
prestigiators
as
many
as
were
in
those
parts

there
are

many

i
am
proud
to
say
that
though
tom
had
not
been
to
if
he
had
he
would
have
certainly
been
senior
was
such
a
little
dogged
hard
gnarly
foursquare
brick
of
an
english
boy
that
he
never
turned
his
head
round
once
all
the
way
from
peacepool
to
the
but
kept
his
eye
on

him
pick
out

scent

cold

which
means
he
never

the
wonderful

it
is

here
begins
the
account
of
the
part
of
the
wonderful
things
which
tom
saw
on
his
journey
to
the
which
all
good
little
children
are
requested
to
read
that
if
ever
they
get
to
the
as
they
may
very
probably
do

may
not
burst
out

any

silly
vulgar

which

bedonebyasyoudid
now
as
soon
as
tom
had
left
peacepool
he
came
to
the
white
lap
of
the
great
ten
thousand
fathoms
deep
where
she
makes
all
day
long
for
the
to
knead
and
the
to
bake
till
it
has
risen
and
hardened
into
and
and
there
tom
was
very
near
being
kneaded
up
in
the
and
turned
into
a
fossil
which
would
have
astonished
the
geological
society
of
new
zealand
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
hence
for
as
he
walked
along
in
the
silence
of
the
on
the
soft
white
ocean
floor
he
was
aware
of
a
hissing
and
a
roaring
and
a
thumping
and
a
pumping
as
of
all
the
in
the
world
at
once
and
when
he
came
near
the
water
grew
not
that
that
hurt
him
in
the
least
but
it
also
grew
as
foul
as
gruel
and
every
moment
he
stumbled
over
dead
shells
and
fish
and
sharks
and
seals
and
whales
which
had
been
killed
by
the
hot
water
and
at
last
he
came
to
the
great
himself
lying
dead
at
the
bottom
and
as
he
was
too
thick
to
scramble
over
tom
had
to
walk
round
him
of
a
mile
and
more
which
put
him
out
of
his
path
sadly
and
when
he
had
got
round
he
came
to
the
place
called
stop
and
there
he
stopped
and
just
in
time
for
he
was
on
the
edge
of
a
vast
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
up
which
was
rushing
and
roaring
clear
steam
enough
to
work
all
the
engines
in
the
world
at
once
so
clear
indeed
that
it
was
quite
light
at
moments
and
tom
could
see
almost
up
to
the
top
of
the
water
above
and
down
below
into
the
pit
for
nobody
knows
how
far
but
as
soon
as
he
bent
his
head
over
the
edge
he
got
such
a
rap
on
the
nose
from
pebbles
that
he
jumped
back
again
for
the
steam
as
it
rushed
up
rasped
away
the
sides
of
the
hole
and
hurled
it
up
into
the
sea
in
a
shower
of
mud
and
gravel
and
ashes
and
then
it
spread
all
around
and
sank
again
and
covered
in
the
dead
fish
so
fast
that
before
tom
had
stood
there
five
minutes
he
was
buried
in
silt
up
to
his
ankles
and
began
to
be
afraid
that
he
should
have
been
buried
alive
and
perhaps
he
would
have
been
but
that
while
he
was
thinking
the
whole
piece
of
ground
on
which
he
stood
was
torn
off
and
blown
upwards
and
away
flew
tom
a
mile
up
through
the
sea
wondering
what
was
coming
next
at
last
he
and
found
himself
tight
in
the
legs
of
the
most
wonderful
bogy
which
he
had
ever
seen
it
had
i
know
how
many
wings
as
big
as
the
sails
of
a
windmill
and
spread
out
in
a
ring
like
them
and
with
them
it
hovered
over
the
steam
which
rushed
up
as
a
ball
hovers
over
the
top
of
a
fountain
and
for
every
wing
above
it
had
a
leg
below
with
a
claw
like
a
comb
at
the
tip
and
a
nostril
at
the
root
and
in
the
middle
it
had
no
stomach
and
one
eye
and
as
for
its
mouth
that
was
all
on
one
side
as
the
madreporiform
tubercle
in
a
is
well
it
was
a
very
strange
beast
but
no
stranger
than
some
dozens
which
you
may
see
do
you
want
here
it
cried
quite
peevishly
in
my
way
and
it
tried
to
drop
tom
but
he
held
on
tight
to
its
claws
thinking
himself
safer
where
he
was
so
tom
told
him
who
he
was
and
what
his
errand
was
and
the
thing
winked
its
one
eye
and
sneered
am
too
old
to
be
taken
in
in
that
way
you
are
come
after
know
you
what
is
gold
and
really
tom
did
not
know
but
the
suspicious
old
bogy
would
not
believe
him
but
after
a
while
tom
began
to
understand
a
little
for
as
the
vapours
came
up
out
of
the
hole
the
bogy
smelt
them
with
his
nostrils
and
combed
them
and
sorted
them
with
his
combs
and
then
when
they
steamed
up
through
them
against
his
wings
they
were
changed
into
showers
and
streams
of
metal
from
one
wing
fell
and
from
another
silver
and
from
another
copper
and
from
another
tin
and
from
another
lead
and
so
on
and
sank
into
the
soft
mud
into
veins
and
cracks
and
hardened
there
whereby
it
comes
to
pass
that
the
rocks
are
full
of
metal
but
all
of
a
sudden
somebody
shut
off
the
steam
below
and
the
hole
was
left
empty
in
an
instant
and
then
down
rushed
the
water
into
the
hole
in
such
a
whirlpool
that
the
bogy
spun
round
and
round
as
fast
as
a
teetotum
but
that
was
all
in
his
work
like
a
fair
fall
with
the
hounds
so
all
he
did
was
to
say
to
is
your
time
youngster
to
get
down
if
you
are
in
earnest
which
i
soon
see
said
tom
and
away
he
went
as
bold
as
baron
munchausen
and
shot
down
the
rushing
cataract
like
a
salmon
at
ballisodare
and
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
he
swam
till
he
was
washed
on
shore
safe
upon
the
and
he
found
it
to
his
surprise
as
most
other
people
do
much
more
like
than
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
expecting
and
first
he
went
through
where
all
the
stupid
books
lie
in
heaps
up
hill
and
down
dale
like
leaves
in
a
winter
wood
and
there
he
saw
people
digging
and
grubbing
among
them
to
make
worse
books
out
of
bad
ones
and
thrashing
chaff
to
save
the
dust
of
it
and
a
very
good
trade
they
drove
thereby
especially
among
children
then
he
went
by
the
sea
of
slops
to
the
mountain
of
messes
and
the
territory
of
tuck
where
the
ground
was
very
sticky
for
it
was
all
made
of
bad
toffee
not
everton
toffee
of
course
and
full
of
deep
cracks
and
holes
choked
with
fruit
and
green
and
sloes
and
crabs
and
whinberries
and
hips
and
haws
and
all
the
nasty
things
which
little
children
will
eat
if
they
can
get
them
but
the
fairies
hide
them
out
of
the
way
in
that
country
as
fast
as
they
can
and
very
hard
work
they
have
and
of
very
little
use
it
is
for
as
fast
as
they
hide
away
the
old
trash
foolish
and
wicked
people
make
fresh
trash
full
of
lime
and
poisonous
paints
and
actually
go
and
steal
receipts
out
of
old
madame
big
book
to
invent
poisons
for
little
children
and
sell
them
at
wakes
and
fairs
and
very
well
let
them
go
on
letheby
and
hassall
can
not
catch
them
though
they
are
setting
traps
for
them
all
day
long
but
the
fairy
with
the
will
catch
them
all
in
time
and
make
them
begin
at
one
corner
of
their
shops
and
eat
their
way
out
at
the
other
by
which
time
they
will
have
got
such
as
will
cure
them
of
poisoning
little
children
next
he
saw
all
the
little
people
in
the
world
writing
all
the
little
books
in
the
world
about
all
the
other
little
people
in
the
world
probably
because
they
had
no
great
people
to
write
about
and
if
the
names
of
the
books
were
not
squeeky
nor
the
nor
the
narrow
narrow
world
nor
the
hills
of
the
chattermuch
nor
the
twaddeday
why
then
they
were
something
else
and
all
the
rest
of
the
little
people
in
the
world
read
the
books
and
thought
themselves
each
as
good
as
the
president
and
perhaps
they
were
right
for
every
one
knows
his
own
business
best
but
tom
thought
he
would
sooner
have
a
jolly
good
fairy
tale
about
jack
the
or
beauty
and
the
beast
which
taught
him
something
that
he
know
already
and
next
he
came
to
the
centre
of
creation
the
hub
they
call
it
there
which
lies
in
latitude
south
and
longitude
east
and
there
he
found
all
the
wise
people
instructing
mankind
in
the
science
of
while
their
house
was
burning
over
their
heads
and
when
tom
told
them
of
the
fire
they
held
an
indignation
meeting
forthwith
and
unanimously
determined
to
hang
dog
for
coming
into
their
country
with
gunpowder
in
his
mouth
tom
help
saying
that
though
they
did
fancy
they
had
carried
all
the
wit
away
with
them
out
of
lincolnshire
two
hundred
years
ago
yet
if
they
had
had
one
such
lincolnshire
nobleman
among
them
as
good
old
lord
yarborough
he
would
have
called
for
the
before
he
hanged
other
dogs
but
it
was
of
no
use
and
the
dog
was
hanged
and
tom
even
have
his
carcase
for
they
had
abolished
the
act
in
that
country
for
fear
lest
when
rogues
fell
out
honest
men
should
come
by
their
own
and
so
they
would
have
succeeded
perfectly
as
they
always
do
only
that
as
they
also
always
do
they
failed
in
one
little
particular
viz
that
the
dog
would
not
die
being
a
but
bit
their
fingers
so
abominably
that
they
were
forced
to
let
him
go
and
tom
likewise
as
british
subjects
whereon
they
recommenced
rapping
for
the
spirits
of
their
fathers
and
very
much
astonished
the
poor
old
spirits
were
when
they
came
and
saw
how
according
to
the
laws
of
bedonebyasyoudid
their
descendants
had
weakened
their
constitution
by
hard
living
then
came
tom
to
the
island
of
polupragmosyne
which
some
call
harbour
but
they
are
wrong
for
that
is
in
the
middle
of
bramshill
bushes
and
the
county
police
have
cleared
it
out
long
ago
there
every
one
knows
his
business
better
than
his
own
and
a
very
noisy
place
it
is
as
might
be
expected
considering
that
all
the
inhabitants
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
house
in
the
of
man
and
the
federation
of
the
world
and
are
always
making
wry
mouths
and
crying
that
the
grapes
were
sour
there
tom
saw
ploughs
drawing
horses
nails
driving
hammers
nests
taking
boys
books
making
authors
bulls
keeping
monkeys
shaving
cats
dead
dogs
drilling
live
lions
blind
brigadiers
shelfed
as
principals
of
colleges
not
in
the
least
shelfed
as
popular
preachers
and
in
short
every
one
set
to
do
something
which
he
had
not
learnt
because
in
what
he
had
learnt
or
pretended
to
learn
he
had
failed
there
stands
the
pantheon
of
the
great
unsuccessful
from

when
he
got
into
the
middle
of
the
town
they
all
set
on
him
at
once
to
show
him
his
way
or
rather
to
show
him
that
he
did
not
know
his
way
for
as
for
asking
him
what
way
he
wanted
to
go
no
one
ever
thought
of
that
but
one
pulled
him
hither
and
another
poked
him
thither
and
a
third
go
west
i
tell
you
it
is
destruction
to
go
i
am
not
going
west
as
you
may
see
said
tom
and
another
east
lies
here
my
dear
i
assure
you
this
is
the
i
want
to
go
east
said
tom
then
at
all
events
whichever
way
you
are
going
you
are
going
wrong
cried
they
all
with
one
was
the
only
thing
which
they
ever
agreed
about
and
all
pointed
at
once
to
all
the
points
of
the
compass
till
tom
thought
all
the
in
england
had
got
together
and
fallen
fighting
and
whether
he
would
have
ever
escaped
out
of
the
town
it
is
hard
to
say
if
the
dog
had
not
taken
it
into
his
head
that
they
were
going
to
pull
his
master
in
pieces
and
tackled
them
so
sharply
about
the
gastrocnemius
muscle
that
he
gave
them
some
business
of
their
own
to
think
of
at
last
and
while
they
were
rubbing
their
bitten
calves
tom
and
the
dog
got
safe
away
on
the
borders
of
that
island
he
found
gotham
where
the
wise
men
live
the
same
who
dragged
the
pond
because
the
moon
had
fallen
into
it
and
planted
a
hedge
round
the
cuckoo
to
keep
spring
all
the
year
and
he
found
them
bricking
up
the
town
gate
because
it
was
so
wide
that
little
folks
could
not
get
through
and
when
he
asked
why
they
told
him
they
were
expanding
their
liturgy
so
he
went
on
for
it
was
no
business
of
his
only
he
could
not
help
saying
that
in
his
country
if
the
kitten
could
not
get
in
at
the
same
hole
as
the
cat
she
might
stay
outside
and
mew
but
he
saw
the
end
of
such
fellows
when
he
came
to
the
island
of
the
golden
asses
where
nothing
but
thistles
grow
for
there
they
were
all
turned
into
mokes
with
ears
a
yard
long
for
meddling
with
matters
which
they
do
not
understand
as
lucius
did
in
the
story
and
like
him
mokes
they
must
remain
till
by
the
laws
of
development
the
thistles
develop
into
roses
till
then
they
must
comfort
themselves
with
the
thought
that
the
longer
their
ears
are
the
thicker
their
hides
and
so
a
good
beating
hurt
them
then
came
tom
to
the
great
land
of
hearsay
in
which
are
no
less
than
thirty
and
odd
kings
beside
half
a
dozen
republics
and
perhaps
more
by
next
mail
and
there
he
fell
in
with
a
deep
dark
deadly
and
destructive
war
waged
by
the
princes
and
potentates
of
those
parts
both
spiritual
and
temporal
against
what
do
you
think
one
thing
i
am
sure
of
that
unless
i
told
you
you
would
never
know
nor
how
they
waged
that
war
either
for
all
their
strategy
and
art
military
consisted
in
the
safe
and
easy
process
of
stopping
their
ears
and
screaming
tell
us
and
then
running
away
so
when
tom
came
into
that
land
he
found
them
all
high
and
low
man
woman
and
child
running
for
their
lives
day
and
night
continually
and
entreating
not
to
be
told
they
know
what
only
the
land
being
an
island
and
they
having
a
dislike
to
the
water
being
a
musty
lot
for
the
most
part
they
ran
round
and
round
the
shore
for
ever
which
as
the
island
was
exactly
of
the
same
circumference
as
the
planet
on
which
we
have
the
honour
of
living
was
hard
work
especially
to
those
who
had
business
to
look
after
but
before
them
as
bandmaster
and
fugleman
ran
a
gentleman
shearing
a
pig
the
melodious
strains
of
which
animal
led
them
for
ever
if
not
to
conquest
still
to
flight
and
kept
up
their
spirits
mightily
with
the
thought
that
they
would
at
least
have
the
wool
for
their
pains
and
running
after
them
day
and
night
came
such
a
poor
lean
seedy
old
giant
as
ought
to
have
been
cockered
up
and
had
a
good
dinner
given
him
and
a
good
wife
found
him
and
been
set
to
play
with
little
children
and
then
he
would
have
been
a
very
presentable
old
fellow
after
all
for
he
had
a
heart
though
it
was
considerably
overgrown
with
brains
he
was
made
up
principally
of
fish
bones
and
parchment
put
together
with
wire
and
canada
balsam
and
smelt
strongly
of
spirits
though
he
never
drank
anything
but
water
but
spirits
he
used
somehow
there
was
no
denying
he
had
a
great
pair
of
spectacles
on
his
nose
and
a
in
one
hand
and
a
geological
hammer
in
the
other
and
was
hung
all
over
with
pockets
full
of
collecting
boxes
bottles
microscopes
telescopes
barometers
ordnance
maps
scalpels
forceps
photographic
apparatus
and
all
other
tackle
for
finding
out
everything
about
everything
and
a
little
more
too
and
most
strange
of
all
he
was
running
not
forwards
but
backwards
as
fast
as
he
could
away
all
the
good
folks
ran
from
him
except
tom
who
stood
his
ground
and
dodged
between
his
legs
and
the
giant
when
he
had
passed
him
looked
down
and
cried
as
if
he
was
quite
pleased
and
comforted
who
are
you
and
you
actually
run
away
like
all
the
rest
but
he
had
to
take
his
spectacles
off
tom
remarked
in
order
to
see
him
plainly
tom
told
him
who
he
was
and
the
giant
pulled
out
a
bottle
and
a
cork
instantly
to
collect
him
with
but
tom
was
too
sharp
for
that
and
dodged
between
his
legs
and
in
front
of
him
and
then
the
giant
could
not
see
him
at
all
no
no
said
tom
not
been
round
the
world
and
through
the
world
and
up
to
mother
haven
beside
being
caught
in
a
net
and
called
a
holothurian
and
a
cephalopod
to
be
bottled
up
by
any
old
giant
like
and
when
the
giant
understood
what
a
great
traveller
tom
had
been
he
made
a
truce
with
him
at
once
and
would
have
kept
him
there
to
this
day
to
pick
his
brains
so
delighted
was
he
at
finding
any
one
to
tell
him
what
he
did
not
know
before
you
lucky
little
dog
said
he
at
last
quite
he
was
the
simplest
pleasantest
honestest
kindliest
old
dominie
sampson
of
a
giant
that
ever
turned
the
world
upside
down
without
intending
you
lucky
little
dog
if
i
had
only
been
where
you
have
been
to
see
what
you
have
seen
said
tom
you
want
to
do
that
you
had
best
put
your
head
under
water
for
a
few
hours
as
i
did
and
turn
into
a
or
some
other
baby
and
then
you
might
have
a
into
a
baby
eh
if
i
could
do
that
and
know
what
was
happening
to
me
for
but
one
hour
i
should
know
everything
then
and
be
at
rest
but
i
i
be
a
little
child
again
and
i
suppose
if
i
could
it
would
be
no
use
because
then
i
should
then
know
nothing
about
what
was
happening
to
me
ah
you
lucky
little
dog
said
the
poor
old
giant
why
do
you
run
after
all
these
poor
people
said
tom
who
liked
the
giant
very
much
dear
they
that
have
been
running
after
me
father
and
son
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
throwing
stones
at
me
till
they
have
knocked
off
my
spectacles
fifty
times
and
calling
me
a
malignant
and
a
turbaned
turk
who
beat
a
venetian
and
traduced
the
only
knows
what
they
mean
for
i
never
read
hunting
me
round
and
catch
me
they
for
every
time
i
go
over
the
same
ground
i
go
the
faster
and
grow
the
bigger
while
all
i
want
is
to
be
friends
with
them
and
to
tell
them
something
to
their
advantage
like
joseph
ady
only
somehow
they
are
so
strangely
afraid
of
hearing
it
but
i
suppose
i
am
not
a
man
of
the
world
and
have
no
why
you
turn
round
and
tell
them
so
i
you
see
i
am
one
of
the
sons
of
epimetheus
and
must
go
backwards
if
i
am
to
go
at
why
you
stop
and
let
them
come
up
to
you
my
dear
only
think
if
i
did
all
the
butterflies
and
cockyolybirds
would
fly
past
me
and
then
i
should
catch
no
more
new
species
and
should
grow
rusty
and
mouldy
and
die
and
i
intend
to
do
that
my
dear
for
i
have
a
destiny
before
me
they
say
though
what
it
is
i
know
and
care
said
tom
do
the
duty
which
lies
nearest
you
and
catch
the
first
beetle
you
come
across
is
my
motto
and
i
have
thriven
by
it
for
some
hundred
years
now
i
must
go
on
dear
me
while
i
have
been
talking
to
you
at
least
nine
new
species
have
escaped
and
on
went
the
giant
behind
before
like
a
bull
in
a
till
he
ran
into
the
steeple
of
the
great
idol
temple
for
they
are
all
idolaters
in
those
parts
of
course
else
they
would
never
be
afraid
of
giants
and
knocked
the
upper
half
clean
off
hurting
himself
horribly
about
the
small
of
the
back
but
little
he
cared
for
as
soon
as
the
ruins
of
the
steeple
were
well
between
his
legs
he
poked
and
peered
among
the
falling
stones
and
shifted
his
spectacles
and
pulled
out
his
and
entirely
new
oniscus
and
three
obscure
podurellæ
besides
a
moth
which
le
roi
des
papillons
though
he
like
all
frenchmen
is
given
to
hasty
inductions
says
is
confined
to
the
limits
of
the
glacial
drift
this
is
most
important
and
down
he
sat
on
the
nave
of
the
temple
not
being
a
man
of
the
world
to
examine
his
podurellæ
whereon
as
was
to
be
expected
the
roof
caved
in
bodily
smashing
the
idols
and
sending
the
priests
flying
out
of
doors
and
windows
like
rabbits
out
of
a
burrow
when
a
ferret
goes
in
but
he
never
heeded
for
out
of
the
dust
flew
a
bat
and
the
giant
had
him
in
a
moment
me
this
is
even
more
important
here
is
a
cognate
species
to
that
which
macgilliwaukie
brown
insists
is
confined
to
the
buddhist
temples
of
little
thibet
and
now
when
i
look
at
it
it
may
be
only
a
variety
produced
by
difference
of
climate
and
having
bagged
his
bat
up
he
got
and
on
he
went
while
all
the
people
ran
being
in
none
the
better
humour
for
having
their
temple
smashed
for
the
sake
of
three
obscure
species
of
podurella
and
a
buddhist
bat
thought
tom
is
a
very
pretty
quarrel
with
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
but
it
is
no
business
of
and
no
more
it
was
because
he
was
a
and
had
the
original
sow
by
the
right
ear
which
you
will
never
have
unless
you
be
a
baby
whether
of
the
water
the
land
or
the
air
matters
not
provided
you
can
only
keep
on
continually
being
a
baby
so
the
giant
ran
round
after
the
people
and
the
people
ran
round
after
the
giant
and
they
are
running
unto
this
day
for
aught
i
know
or
do
not
know
and
will
run
till
either
he
or
they
or
both
turn
into
little
children
and
then
as
shakespeare
says
and
therefore
it
must
be
true
shall
have
shall
go
man
shall
have
his
mare
all
go
then
tom
came
to
a
very
famous
island
which
was
called
in
the
days
of
the
great
traveller
captain
gulliver
the
isle
of
laputa
but
bedonebyasyoudid
has
named
it
over
again
the
isle
of
tomtoddies
all
heads
and
no
bodies
and
when
tom
came
near
it
he
heard
such
a
grumbling
and
grunting
and
growling
and
wailing
and
weeping
and
whining
that
he
thought
people
must
be
ringing
little
pigs
or
cropping
ears
or
drowning
kittens
but
when
he
came
nearer
still
he
began
to
hear
words
among
the
noise
which
was
the
song
which
they
sing
morning
and
evening
and
all
night
too
to
their
great
idol
learn
my
and
that
was
the
only
song
which
they
knew
and
when
tom
got
on
shore
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
great
pillar
on
one
side
of
which
was
inscribed
not
allowed
here
at
which
he
was
so
shocked
that
he
would
not
stay
to
see
what
was
written
on
the
other
side
then
he
looked
round
for
the
people
of
the
island
but
instead
of
men
women
and
children
he
found
nothing
but
turnips
and
radishes
beet
and
mangold
wurzel
without
a
single
green
leaf
among
them
and
half
of
them
burst
and
decayed
with
growing
out
of
them
those
which
were
left
began
crying
to
tom
in
half
a
dozen
different
languages
at
once
and
all
of
them
badly
spoken
learn
my
lesson
do
come
and
help
me
and
one
cried
you
show
me
how
to
extract
this
square
root
and
another
you
tell
me
the
distance
between
α
lyræ
and
β
camelopardis
and
another
is
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
snooksville
in
county
oregon
and
another
was
the
name
of
mutius
thirteenth
cat
and
another
long
would
it
take
a
of
average
activity
to
tumble
head
over
heels
from
london
to
york
and
another
you
tell
me
the
name
of
a
place
that
nobody
ever
heard
of
where
nothing
ever
happened
in
a
country
which
has
not
been
discovered
yet
and
another
you
show
me
how
to
correct
this
hopelessly
corrupt
passage
of
graidiocolosyrtus
tabenniticus
on
the
cause
why
crocodiles
have
no
tongues
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
one
would
have
thought
they
were
all
trying
for
places
or
cornetcies
in
the
heavy
dragoons
what
good
on
earth
will
it
do
you
if
i
did
tell
you
quoth
tom
well
they
know
that
all
they
knew
was
the
examiner
was
coming
then
tom
stumbled
on
the
hugest
and
softest
nimblecomequick
turnip
you
ever
saw
filling
a
hole
in
a
crop
of
swedes
and
it
cried
to
him
you
tell
me
anything
at
all
about
anything
you
like
what
says
tom
anything
you
like
for
as
fast
as
i
learn
things
i
forget
them
again
so
my
mamma
says
that
my
intellect
is
not
adapted
for
methodic
science
and
says
that
i
must
go
in
for
general
tom
told
him
that
he
did
not
know
general
information
nor
any
officers
in
the
army
only
he
had
a
friend
once
that
went
for
a
drummer
but
he
could
tell
him
a
great
many
strange
things
which
he
had
seen
in
his
travels
so
he
told
him
prettily
enough
while
the
poor
turnip
listened
very
carefully
and
the
more
he
listened
the
more
he
forgot
and
the
more
water
ran
out
of
him
tom
thought
he
was
crying
but
it
was
only
his
poor
brains
running
away
from
being
worked
so
hard
and
as
tom
talked
the
unhappy
turnip
streamed
down
all
over
with
juice
and
split
and
shrank
till
nothing
was
left
of
him
but
rind
and
water
whereat
tom
ran
away
in
a
fright
for
he
thought
he
might
be
taken
up
for
killing
the
turnip
picture
the
turnip
but
on
the
contrary
the
parents
were
highly
delighted
and
considered
him
a
saint
and
a
martyr
and
put
up
a
long
inscription
over
his
tomb
about
his
wonderful
talents
early
development
and
unparalleled
precocity
were
they
not
a
foolish
couple
but
there
was
a
still
more
foolish
couple
next
to
them
who
were
beating
a
wretched
little
radish
no
bigger
than
my
thumb
for
sullenness
and
obstinacy
and
wilful
stupidity
and
never
knew
that
the
reason
why
it
learn
or
hardly
even
speak
was
that
there
was
a
great
worm
inside
it
eating
out
all
its
brains
but
even
they
are
no
foolisher
than
some
hundred
score
of
papas
and
mammas
who
fetch
the
rod
when
they
ought
to
fetch
a
new
toy
and
send
to
the
dark
cupboard
instead
of
to
the
doctor
tom
was
so
puzzled
and
frightened
with
all
he
saw
that
he
was
longing
to
ask
the
meaning
of
it
and
at
last
he
stumbled
over
a
respectable
old
stick
lying
half
covered
with
earth
but
a
very
stout
and
worthy
stick
it
was
for
it
belonged
to
good
roger
ascham
in
old
time
and
had
carved
on
its
head
king
edward
the
sixth
with
the
bible
in
his
hand
see
said
the
stick
were
as
pretty
little
children
once
as
you
could
wish
to
see
and
might
have
been
so
still
if
they
had
been
only
left
to
grow
up
like
human
beings
and
then
handed
over
to
me
but
their
foolish
fathers
and
mothers
instead
of
letting
them
pick
flowers
and
make
and
get
nests
and
dance
round
the
gooseberry
bush
as
little
children
should
kept
them
always
at
lessons
working
working
working
learning
lessons
all
and
sunday
lessons
all
sunday
and
weekly
examinations
every
saturday
and
monthly
examinations
every
month
and
yearly
examinations
every
year
everything
seven
times
over
as
if
once
was
not
enough
and
enough
as
good
as
a
their
brains
grew
big
and
their
bodies
grew
small
and
they
were
all
changed
into
turnips
with
little
but
water
inside
and
still
their
foolish
parents
actually
pick
the
leaves
off
them
as
fast
as
they
grow
lest
they
should
have
anything
green
about
said
tom
dear
doasyouwouldbedoneby
knew
of
it
she
would
send
them
a
lot
of
tops
and
balls
and
marbles
and
ninepins
and
make
them
all
as
jolly
as
would
be
no
use
said
the
stick
play
now
if
they
tried
you
see
how
their
legs
have
turned
to
roots
and
grown
into
the
ground
by
never
taking
any
exercise
but
sapping
and
moping
always
in
the
same
place
but
here
comes
the
so
you
had
better
get
away
i
warn
you
or
he
will
examine
you
and
your
dog
into
the
bargain
and
set
him
to
examine
all
the
other
dogs
and
you
to
examine
all
the
other
there
is
no
escaping
out
of
his
hands
for
his
nose
is
nine
thousand
miles
long
and
can
go
down
chimneys
and
through
keyholes
upstairs
downstairs
in
my
chamber
examining
all
little
boys
and
the
little
tutors
likewise
but
when
he
is
bedonebyasyoudid
has
promised
shall
have
the
thrashing
of
him
and
if
i
lay
it
on
with
a
will
a
tom
went
off
but
rather
slowly
and
surlily
for
he
was
somewhat
minded
to
face
this
same
who
came
striding
among
the
poor
turnips
binding
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
borne
and
laying
them
on
little
shoulders
like
the
scribes
and
pharisees
of
old
and
not
touching
the
same
with
one
of
his
fingers
for
he
had
plenty
of
money
and
a
fine
house
to
live
in
and
so
forth
which
was
more
than
the
poor
little
turnips
had
but
when
he
got
near
he
looked
so
big
and
burly
and
dictatorial
and
shouted
so
loud
to
tom
to
come
and
be
examined
that
tom
ran
for
his
life
and
the
dog
too
and
really
it
was
time
for
the
poor
turnips
in
their
hurry
and
fright
crammed
themselves
so
fast
to
be
ready
for
the
examiner
that
they
burst
and
popped
by
dozens
all
round
him
till
the
place
sounded
like
aldershot
on
a
and
tom
thought
he
should
be
blown
into
the
air
dog
and
all
as
he
went
down
to
the
shore
he
passed
the
poor
new
tomb
but
bedonebyasyoudid
had
taken
away
the
epitaph
about
talents
and
precocity
and
development
and
put
up
one
of
her
own
instead
which
tom
thought
much
more
sensible
sore
long
time
i
cramming
was
in
heaven
did
please
my
woes
to
water
on
the
so
tom
jumped
into
the
sea
and
swam
on
his
way
singing
thank
my
nought
i
know
save
those
three
royal
and
riting
help
a
lad
of
sense
through
thin
and
whereby
you
may
see
that
tom
was
no
poet
but
no
more
was
john
bunyan
though
he
was
as
wise
a
man
as
you
will
meet
in
a
month
of
sundays
and
next
he
came
to
oldwivesfabledom
where
the
folks
were
all
heathens
and
worshipped
a
howling
ape
and
there
he
found
a
little
boy
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
crying
bitterly
are
you
crying
for
said
tom
i
am
not
as
frightened
as
i
could
wish
to
frightened
you
are
a
queer
little
chap
but
if
you
want
to
be
frightened
here
said
the
little
boy
is
very
kind
of
you
but
i
feel
that
it
has
made
any
tom
offered
to
upset
him
punch
him
stamp
on
him
fettle
him
over
the
head
with
a
brick
or
anything
else
whatsoever
which
would
give
him
the
slightest
comfort
but
he
only
thanked
tom
very
civilly
in
fine
long
words
which
he
had
heard
other
folk
use
and
which
therefore
he
thought
were
fit
and
proper
to
use
himself
and
cried
on
till
his
papa
and
mamma
came
and
sent
off
for
the
powwow
man
immediately
and
a
very
gentleman
and
lady
they
were
though
they
were
heathens
and
talked
quite
pleasantly
to
tom
about
his
travels
till
the
powwow
man
arrived
with
his
thunderbox
under
his
arm
and
a
gentleman
he
was
as
ever
served
her
majesty
at
portland
tom
was
a
little
frightened
at
first
for
he
thought
it
was
grimes
but
he
soon
saw
his
mistake
for
grimes
always
looked
a
man
in
the
face
and
this
fellow
never
did
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
fire
and
smoke
and
when
he
sneezed
it
was
squibs
and
crackers
and
when
he
cried
which
he
did
whenever
it
paid
him
it
was
boiling
pitch
and
some
of
it
was
sure
to
stick
we
are
again
cried
he
like
the
clown
in
a
pantomime
you
feel
frightened
my
little
do
that
for
you
make
an
impression
on
you
yah
boo
whirroo
hullabaloo
and
he
rattled
thumped
brandished
his
thunderbox
yelled
shouted
raved
roared
stamped
and
danced
corrobory
like
any
black
fellow
and
then
he
touched
a
spring
in
the
thunderbox
and
out
popped
and
and
pasteboard
bogies
and
jacks
and
sallaballas
with
such
a
horrid
din
clatter
clank
roll
rattle
and
roar
that
the
little
boy
turned
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
and
fainted
right
away
and
at
that
his
poor
heathen
papa
and
mamma
were
as
much
delighted
as
if
they
had
found
a
gold
mine
and
fell
down
upon
their
knees
before
the
powwow
man
and
gave
him
a
palanquin
with
a
pole
of
solid
silver
and
curtains
of
cloth
of
gold
and
carried
him
about
in
it
on
their
own
backs
but
as
soon
as
they
had
taken
him
up
the
pole
stuck
to
their
shoulders
and
they
could
not
set
him
down
any
more
but
carried
him
on
willynilly
as
sinbad
carried
the
old
man
of
the
sea
which
was
a
pitiable
sight
to
see
for
the
father
was
a
very
brave
officer
and
wore
two
swords
and
a
blue
button
and
the
mother
was
as
pretty
a
lady
as
ever
had
pinched
feet
like
a
chinese
but
you
see
they
had
chosen
to
do
a
foolish
thing
just
once
too
often
so
by
the
laws
of
bedonebyasyoudid
they
had
to
go
on
doing
it
whether
they
chose
or
not
till
the
coming
of
the
cocqcigrues
ah
you
wish
that
some
one
would
go
and
convert
those
poor
heathens
and
teach
them
not
to
frighten
their
little
children
into
fits
then
said
the
powwow
man
to
tom
you
like
to
be
frightened
my
little
dear
for
i
can
see
plainly
that
you
are
a
very
wicked
naughty
graceless
reprobate
another
quoth
tom
very
sturdily
and
when
the
man
ran
at
him
and
cried
tom
ran
at
him
in
return
and
cried
likewise
right
in
his
face
and
set
the
little
dog
upon
him
and
at
his
legs
the
dog
went
at
which
if
you
will
believe
it
the
fellow
turned
tail
thunderbox
and
all
with
a
like
an
old
sow
on
the
common
and
ran
for
his
life
screaming
thieves
murder
fire
he
is
going
to
kill
me
i
am
a
ruined
man
he
will
murder
me
and
break
burn
and
destroy
my
precious
and
invaluable
thunderbox
and
then
you
will
have
no
more
in
the
land
help
help
help
at
which
the
papa
and
mamma
and
all
the
people
of
oldwivesfabledom
flew
at
tom
shouting
the
wicked
impudent
graceless
boy
beat
him
kick
him
shoot
him
drown
him
hang
him
burn
him
and
so
forth
but
luckily
they
had
nothing
to
shoot
hang
or
burn
him
with
for
the
fairies
had
hid
all
the
out
of
the
way
a
little
while
before
so
they
could
only
pelt
him
with
stones
and
some
of
the
stones
went
clean
through
him
and
came
out
the
other
side
but
he
did
not
mind
that
a
bit
for
the
holes
closed
up
again
as
fast
as
they
were
made
because
he
was
a
however
he
was
very
glad
when
he
was
safe
out
of
the
country
for
the
noise
there
made
him
all
but
deaf
then
he
came
to
a
very
quiet
place
called
leaveheavenalone
and
there
the
sun
was
drawing
water
out
of
the
sea
to
make
and
the
wind
was
twisting
them
up
to
make
till
they
had
worked
between
them
the
loveliest
wedding
veil
of
chantilly
lace
and
hung
it
up
in
their
own
crystal
palace
for
any
one
to
buy
who
could
afford
it
while
the
good
old
sea
never
grudged
for
she
knew
they
would
pay
her
back
honestly
so
the
sun
span
and
the
wind
wove
and
all
went
well
with
the
great
as
is
likely
and
at
last
after
innumerable
adventures
each
more
wonderful
than
the
last
he
saw
before
him
a
huge
building
much
bigger
is
most
little
uglier
than
a
certain
new
lunatic
asylum
but
not
built
quite
of
the
same
materials
none
of
it
at
indeed
for
aught
that
i
ever
saw
any
part
of
any
other
building
cased
with
brick
inside
and
out
and
filled
up
with
rubble
between
the
walls
in
order
that
any
gentleman
who
has
been
confined
during
her
pleasure
may
be
unconfined
during
his
own
pleasure
and
take
a
walk
in
the
neighbouring
park
to
improve
his
spirits
after
an
light
and
wholesome
labour
with
his
or
one
of
the
legs
of
his
iron
bedstead
no
the
walls
of
this
building
were
built
on
an
entirely
different
principle
which
need
not
be
described
as
it
has
not
yet
been
discovered
picture
truncheon
tom
walked
towards
this
great
building
wondering
what
it
was
and
having
a
strange
fancy
that
he
might
find
grimes
inside
it
till
he
saw
running
toward
him
and
shouting
three
or
four
people
who
when
they
came
nearer
were
nothing
else
than
truncheons
running
along
without
legs
or
arms
tom
was
not
astonished
he
was
long
past
that
besides
he
had
seen
the
naviculæ
in
the
water
move
nobody
knows
how
a
hundred
times
without
arms
or
legs
or
anything
to
stand
in
their
stead
neither
was
he
frightened
for
he
had
been
doing
no
harm
so
he
stopped
and
when
the
foremost
truncheon
came
up
and
asked
his
business
he
showed
mother
pass
and
the
truncheon
looked
at
it
in
the
oddest
fashion
for
he
had
one
eye
in
the
middle
of
his
upper
end
so
that
when
he
looked
at
anything
being
quite
stiff
he
had
to
slope
himself
and
poke
himself
till
it
was
a
wonder
why
he
did
not
tumble
over
but
being
quite
full
of
the
spirit
of
justice
as
all
policemen
and
their
truncheons
ought
to
be
he
was
always
in
a
position
of
stable
equilibrium
whichever
way
he
put
himself
on
said
he
at
last
and
then
he
added
had
better
go
with
you
young
and
tom
had
no
objection
for
such
company
was
both
respectable
and
safe
so
the
truncheon
coiled
its
thong
neatly
round
its
handle
to
prevent
tripping
itself
the
thong
had
got
loose
in
marched
on
by
side
have
you
no
policeman
to
carry
you
asked
tom
after
a
while
we
are
not
like
those
truncheons
in
the
which
can
not
go
without
having
a
whole
man
to
carry
them
about
we
do
our
own
work
for
ourselves
and
do
it
very
well
though
i
say
it
who
should
why
have
you
a
thong
to
your
handle
asked
tom
hang
ourselves
up
by
of
course
when
we
are
off
tom
had
got
his
answer
and
had
no
more
to
say
till
they
came
up
to
the
great
iron
door
of
the
prison
and
there
the
truncheon
knocked
twice
with
its
own
head
a
wicket
in
the
door
opened
and
out
looked
a
tremendous
old
brass
blunderbuss
charged
up
to
the
muzzle
with
slugs
who
was
the
porter
and
tom
started
back
a
little
at
the
sight
of
him
picture
the
blunderbuss
case
is
this
he
asked
in
a
deep
voice
out
of
his
broad
bell
mouth
you
please
sir
it
is
no
case
only
a
young
gentleman
from
her
ladyship
who
wants
to
see
grimes
the
said
the
blunderbuss
and
he
pulled
in
his
muzzle
perhaps
to
look
over
his
is
up
chimney
no
he
said
from
inside
the
young
gentleman
had
better
go
on
to
the
tom
looked
up
at
the
enormous
wall
which
seemed
at
least
ninety
miles
high
and
wondered
how
he
should
ever
get
up
but
when
he
hinted
that
to
the
truncheon
it
settled
the
matter
in
a
moment
for
it
whisked
round
and
gave
him
such
a
shove
behind
as
sent
him
up
to
the
roof
in
no
time
with
his
little
dog
under
his
arm
and
there
he
walked
along
the
leads
till
he
met
another
truncheon
and
told
him
his
errand
good
it
said
along
but
it
will
be
of
no
use
he
is
the
most
unremorseful
fellow
i
have
in
charge
and
thinks
about
nothing
but
beer
and
pipes
which
are
not
allowed
here
of
so
they
walked
along
over
the
leads
and
very
sooty
they
were
and
tom
thought
the
chimneys
must
want
sweeping
very
much
but
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
soot
did
not
stick
to
his
feet
or
dirty
them
in
the
least
neither
did
the
live
coals
which
were
lying
about
in
plenty
burn
him
for
being
a
his
radical
humours
were
of
a
moist
and
cold
nature
as
you
may
read
at
large
in
lemnius
cardan
van
helmont
and
other
gentlemen
who
knew
as
much
as
they
could
and
no
man
can
know
more
and
at
last
they
came
to
chimney
no
out
of
the
top
of
it
his
head
and
shoulders
just
showing
stuck
poor
grimes
so
sooty
and
bleared
and
ugly
that
tom
could
hardly
bear
to
look
at
him
and
in
his
mouth
was
a
pipe
but
it
was
not
though
he
was
pulling
at
it
with
all
his
might
picture
tom
and
grimes
grimes
said
the
truncheon
is
a
gentleman
come
to
see
but
grimes
only
said
bad
words
and
kept
grumbling
pipe
draw
my
pipe
a
civil
tongue
and
attend
said
the
truncheon
and
popped
up
just
like
punch
hitting
grimes
such
a
crack
over
the
head
with
itself
that
his
brains
rattled
inside
like
a
dried
walnut
in
its
shell
he
tried
to
get
his
hands
out
and
rub
the
place
but
he
could
not
for
they
were
stuck
fast
in
the
chimney
now
he
was
forced
to
attend
he
said
tom
i
suppose
you
have
come
here
to
laugh
at
me
you
spiteful
little
atomy
tom
assured
him
he
had
not
but
only
wanted
to
help
him
want
anything
except
beer
and
that
i
get
and
a
light
to
this
bothering
pipe
and
that
i
get
get
you
one
said
tom
and
he
took
up
a
live
coal
there
were
plenty
lying
about
and
put
it
to
pipe
but
it
went
out
instantly
no
use
said
the
truncheon
leaning
itself
up
against
the
chimney
and
looking
on
tell
you
it
is
no
use
his
heart
is
so
cold
that
it
freezes
everything
that
comes
near
him
you
will
see
that
presently
plain
of
course
my
fault
always
my
fault
said
grimes
go
to
hit
me
for
the
truncheon
started
upright
and
looked
very
wicked
know
if
my
arms
were
only
free
you
hit
me
the
truncheon
leant
back
against
the
chimney
and
took
no
notice
of
the
personal
insult
like
a
policeman
as
it
was
though
he
was
ready
enough
to
avenge
any
transgression
against
morality
or
order
i
help
you
in
any
other
way
i
help
you
to
get
out
of
this
chimney
said
tom
interposed
the
truncheon
has
come
to
the
place
where
everybody
must
help
themselves
and
he
will
find
it
out
i
hope
before
he
has
done
with
yes
said
grimes
course
me
did
i
ask
to
be
brought
here
into
the
prison
did
i
ask
to
be
set
to
sweep
your
foul
chimneys
did
i
ask
to
have
lighted
straw
put
under
me
to
make
me
go
up
did
i
ask
to
stick
fast
in
the
very
first
chimney
of
all
because
it
was
so
shamefully
clogged
up
with
soot
did
i
ask
to
stay
know
how
hundred
years
i
do
believe
and
never
get
my
pipe
nor
my
beer
nor
nothing
fit
for
a
beast
let
alone
a
man
answered
a
solemn
voice
behind
more
did
tom
when
you
behaved
to
him
in
the
very
same
it
was
bedonebyasyoudid
and
when
the
truncheon
saw
her
it
started
bolt
made
such
a
low
bow
that
if
it
had
not
been
full
of
the
spirit
of
justice
it
must
have
tumbled
on
its
end
and
probably
hurt
its
one
eye
and
tom
made
his
bow
too
he
said
think
about
me
all
past
and
gone
and
good
times
and
bad
times
and
all
times
pass
over
but
may
not
i
help
poor
grimes
i
try
and
get
some
of
these
bricks
away
that
he
may
move
his
arms
may
try
of
course
she
said
so
tom
pulled
and
tugged
at
the
bricks
but
he
could
not
move
one
and
then
he
tried
to
wipe
face
but
the
soot
would
not
come
off
dear
he
said
have
come
all
this
way
through
all
these
terrible
places
to
help
you
and
now
i
am
of
no
use
at
had
best
leave
me
alone
said
grimes
are
a
forgiving
little
chap
and
truth
but
best
be
off
the
coming
on
soon
and
it
will
beat
the
eyes
out
of
your
little
hail
hail
that
falls
every
evening
here
and
till
it
comes
close
to
me
like
so
much
warm
rain
but
then
it
turns
to
hail
over
my
head
and
knocks
me
about
like
small
hail
will
never
come
any
more
said
the
strange
lady
have
told
you
before
what
it
was
it
was
your
tears
those
which
she
shed
when
she
prayed
for
you
by
her
bedside
but
your
cold
heart
froze
it
into
hail
but
she
is
gone
to
heaven
now
and
will
weep
no
more
for
her
graceless
then
grimes
was
silent
awhile
and
then
he
looked
very
sad
my
old
gone
and
i
never
there
to
speak
to
her
ah
a
good
woman
she
was
and
might
have
been
a
happy
one
in
her
little
school
there
in
vendale
if
it
been
for
me
and
my
bad
she
keep
the
school
in
vendale
asked
tom
and
then
he
told
grimes
all
the
story
of
his
going
to
her
house
and
how
she
could
not
abide
the
sight
of
a
and
then
how
kind
she
was
and
how
he
turned
into
a
said
grimes
reason
she
had
to
hate
the
sight
of
a
i
ran
away
from
her
and
took
up
with
the
sweeps
and
never
let
her
know
where
i
was
nor
sent
her
a
penny
to
help
her
and
now
too
late
said
grimes
and
he
began
crying
and
blubbering
like
a
great
baby
till
his
pipe
dropped
out
of
his
mouth
and
broke
all
to
bits
dear
if
i
was
but
a
little
chap
in
vendale
again
to
see
the
clear
beck
and
the
and
the
how
different
i
would
go
on
but
too
late
now
so
you
go
along
you
kind
little
chap
and
stand
to
look
at
a
man
crying
old
enough
to
be
your
father
and
never
feared
the
face
of
man
nor
of
worse
neither
but
beat
now
and
beat
i
must
be
made
my
bed
and
i
must
lie
on
it
foul
i
would
be
and
foul
i
am
as
an
irishwoman
said
to
me
once
and
little
i
heeded
it
all
my
own
fault
but
too
and
he
cried
so
bitterly
that
tom
began
crying
too
too
late
said
the
fairy
in
such
a
strange
soft
new
voice
that
tom
looked
up
at
her
and
she
was
so
beautiful
for
the
moment
that
tom
half
fancied
she
was
her
sister
no
more
was
it
too
late
for
as
poor
grimes
cried
and
blubbered
on
his
own
tears
did
what
his
could
not
do
and
could
not
do
and
on
earth
could
do
for
him
for
they
washed
the
soot
off
his
face
and
off
his
clothes
and
then
they
washed
the
mortar
away
from
between
the
bricks
and
the
chimney
crumbled
down
and
grimes
began
to
get
out
of
it
up
jumped
the
truncheon
and
was
going
to
hit
him
on
the
crown
a
tremendous
thump
and
drive
him
down
again
like
a
cork
into
a
bottle
but
the
strange
lady
put
it
aside
you
obey
me
if
i
give
you
a
chance
you
please
stronger
than
i
know
too
well
and
wiser
than
me
i
know
too
well
also
and
as
for
being
my
own
master
fared
ill
enough
with
that
as
yet
so
whatever
your
ladyship
pleases
to
order
me
for
beat
and
the
it
so
may
come
out
but
remember
disobey
me
again
and
into
a
worse
place
still
you
beg
pardon
but
i
never
disobeyed
you
that
i
know
of
i
never
had
the
honour
of
setting
eyes
upon
you
till
i
came
to
these
ugly
saw
me
who
said
to
you
those
that
will
be
foul
foul
they
will
be
grimes
looked
up
and
tom
looked
up
too
for
the
voice
was
that
of
the
irishwoman
who
met
them
the
day
that
they
went
out
together
to
harthover
gave
you
your
warning
then
but
you
gave
it
yourself
a
thousand
times
before
and
since
every
bad
word
that
you
cruel
and
mean
thing
that
you
time
that
you
got
day
that
you
went
were
disobeying
me
whether
you
knew
it
or
only
known
knew
well
enough
that
you
were
disobeying
something
though
you
did
not
know
it
was
me
but
come
out
and
take
your
chance
perhaps
it
may
be
your
so
grimes
stepped
out
of
the
chimney
and
really
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
scars
on
his
face
he
looked
as
clean
and
respectable
as
a
need
look
him
away
said
she
to
the
truncheon
give
him
his
what
is
he
to
do
him
to
sweep
out
the
crater
of
etna
he
will
find
some
very
steady
men
working
out
their
time
there
who
will
teach
him
his
business
but
mind
if
that
crater
gets
choked
again
and
there
is
an
earthquake
in
consequence
bring
them
all
to
me
and
i
shall
investigate
the
case
very
so
the
truncheon
marched
off
grimes
looking
as
meek
as
a
drowned
worm
and
for
aught
i
know
or
do
not
know
he
is
sweeping
the
crater
of
etna
to
this
very
day
now
said
the
fairy
to
tom
work
here
is
done
you
may
as
well
go
back
should
be
glad
enough
to
go
said
tom
how
am
i
to
get
up
that
great
hole
again
now
the
steam
has
stopped
blowing
will
take
you
up
the
backstairs
but
i
must
bandage
your
eyes
first
for
i
never
allow
anybody
to
see
those
backstairs
of
am
sure
i
shall
not
tell
anybody
about
them
if
you
bid
me
so
you
think
my
little
man
but
you
would
soon
forget
your
promise
if
you
got
back
into
the
for
if
people
only
once
found
out
that
you
had
been
up
my
backstairs
you
would
have
all
the
fine
ladies
kneeling
to
you
and
the
rich
men
emptying
their
purses
before
you
and
statesmen
offering
you
place
and
power
and
young
and
old
rich
and
poor
crying
to
you
tell
us
the
great
backstairs
secret
and
we
will
be
your
slaves
we
will
make
you
lord
king
emperor
bishop
archbishop
pope
if
you
tell
us
the
secret
of
the
backstairs
for
thousands
of
years
we
have
been
paying
and
petting
and
obeying
and
worshipping
quacks
who
told
us
they
had
the
key
of
the
backstairs
and
could
smuggle
us
up
them
and
in
spite
of
all
our
disappointments
we
will
honour
and
glorify
and
adore
and
beatify
and
translate
and
apotheotise
you
likewise
on
the
chance
of
your
knowing
something
about
the
backstairs
that
we
may
all
go
on
pilgrimage
to
it
and
even
if
we
can
not
get
up
it
lie
at
the
foot
of
it
and
save
us
from
the
consequences
of
our
own
actions
and
from
the
cruel
fairy
bedonebyasyoudid
do
not
you
think
that
you
would
be
a
little
tempted
then
to
tell
what
you
know
laddie
tom
thought
so
certainly
why
do
they
want
so
to
know
about
the
backstairs
asked
he
being
a
little
frightened
at
the
long
words
and
not
understanding
them
the
least
as
indeed
he
was
not
meant
to
do
or
you
either
i
shall
not
tell
you
i
never
put
things
into
little
heads
which
are
but
too
likely
to
come
there
of
themselves
so
i
must
bandage
your
so
she
tied
the
bandage
on
his
eyes
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
she
took
it
off
she
said
are
safe
up
the
tom
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
and
his
mouth
too
for
he
had
not
as
he
thought
moved
a
single
step
but
when
he
looked
round
him
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
safe
up
the
backstairs
whatsoever
they
may
be
which
no
man
is
going
to
tell
you
for
the
plain
reason
that
no
man
knows
the
first
thing
which
tom
saw
was
the
black
cedars
high
and
sharp
against
the
rosy
dawn
and
isle
reflected
double
in
the
still
broad
silver
sea
the
wind
sang
softly
in
the
cedars
and
the
water
sang
among
the
eaves
the
sang
as
they
streamed
out
into
the
ocean
and
the
as
they
built
among
the
boughs
and
the
air
was
so
full
of
song
that
it
stirred
brandan
and
his
hermits
as
they
slumbered
in
the
shade
and
they
moved
their
good
old
lips
and
sang
their
morning
hymn
amid
their
dreams
but
among
all
the
songs
one
came
across
the
water
more
sweet
and
clear
than
all
for
it
was
the
song
of
a
young
voice
and
what
was
the
song
which
she
sang
ah
my
little
man
i
am
too
old
to
sing
that
song
and
you
too
young
to
understand
it
but
have
patience
and
keep
your
eye
single
and
your
hands
clean
and
you
will
learn
some
day
to
sing
it
yourself
without
needing
any
man
to
teach
you
and
as
tom
neared
the
island
there
sat
upon
a
rock
the
most
graceful
creature
that
ever
was
seen
looking
down
with
her
chin
upon
her
hand
and
paddling
with
her
feet
in
the
water
and
when
they
came
to
her
she
looked
up
and
behold
it
was
ellie
miss
ellie
said
he
you
are
grown
tom
said
she
you
are
grown
too
picture
ellie
and
no
wonder
they
were
both
quite
grown
into
a
tall
man
and
she
into
a
beautiful
woman
i
may
be
grown
she
said
have
had
time
enough
for
i
have
been
sitting
here
waiting
for
you
many
a
hundred
years
till
i
thought
you
were
never
a
hundred
years
thought
tom
but
he
had
seen
so
much
in
his
travels
that
he
had
quite
given
up
being
astonished
and
indeed
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
ellie
so
he
stood
and
looked
at
ellie
and
ellie
looked
at
him
and
they
liked
the
employment
so
much
that
they
stood
and
looked
for
seven
years
more
and
neither
spoke
nor
stirred
at
last
they
heard
the
fairy
say
children
are
you
never
going
to
look
at
me
again
have
been
looking
at
you
all
this
while
they
said
and
so
they
thought
they
had
been
look
at
me
once
more
said
she
they
both
of
them
cried
out
at
once
who
are
you
after
all
are
our
dear
you
are
good
bedonebyasyoudid
but
you
are
grown
quite
beautiful
now
you
said
the
fairy
look
are
mother
carey
said
tom
in
a
very
low
solemn
voice
for
he
had
found
out
something
which
made
him
very
happy
and
yet
frightened
him
more
than
all
that
he
had
ever
seen
you
are
grown
quite
young
you
said
the
fairy
are
the
irishwoman
who
met
me
the
day
i
went
to
harthover
and
when
they
looked
she
was
neither
of
them
and
yet
all
of
them
at
once
name
is
written
in
my
eyes
if
you
have
eyes
to
see
it
and
they
looked
into
her
great
deep
soft
eyes
and
they
changed
again
and
again
into
every
hue
as
the
light
changes
in
a
diamond
read
my
name
said
she
at
last
and
her
eyes
flashed
for
one
moment
clear
white
blazing
light
but
the
children
could
not
read
her
name
for
they
were
dazzled
and
hid
their
faces
in
their
hands
yet
young
things
not
yet
said
she
smiling
and
then
she
turned
to
ellie
may
take
him
home
with
you
now
on
sundays
ellie
he
has
won
his
spurs
in
the
great
battle
and
become
fit
to
go
with
you
and
be
a
man
because
he
has
done
the
thing
he
did
not
so
tom
went
home
with
ellie
on
sundays
and
sometimes
on
too
and
he
is
now
a
great
man
of
science
and
can
plan
railroads
and
and
electric
telegraphs
and
rifled
guns
and
so
forth
and
knows
everything
about
everything
except
why
a
egg
turn
into
a
crocodile
and
two
or
three
other
little
things
which
no
one
will
know
till
the
coming
of
the
cocqcigrues
and
all
this
from
what
he
learnt
when
he
was
a
underneath
the
sea
of
course
tom
married
ellie
my
dear
child
what
a
silly
notion
you
know
that
no
one
ever
marries
in
a
fairy
tale
under
the
rank
of
a
prince
or
a
princess
dog
oh
you
may
see
him
any
clear
night
in
july
for
the
old
was
so
worn
out
by
the
last
three
hot
summers
that
there
have
been
no
since
so
that
they
had
to
take
him
down
and
put
dog
up
in
his
place
therefore
as
new
brooms
sweep
clean
we
may
hope
for
some
warm
weather
this
year
and
that
is
the
end
of
my
story
moral
dear
little
should
we
learn
from
this
should
learn
or
am
not
exactly
sure
one
may
that
is
we
see
efts
in
the
to
throw
stones
at
catch
them
with
crooked
put
them
into
vivariums
with
the
sticklebacks
may
prick
them
in
their
poor
little
make
them
jump
out
of
the
glass
into
so
come
to
a
bad
these
efts
are
nothing
else
but
the
who
are
stupid
and
will
not
learn
their
lessons
and
keep
themselves
comparative
anatomists
will
tell
you
fifty
years
they
are
not
learned
enough
to
tell
you
skulls
grow
jaws
grow
their
brains
grow
their
tails
grow
they
lose
all
their
i
am
sure
you
would
not
like
to
their
skins
grow
dirty
and
they
never
get
into
the
clear
less
into
the
great
wide
hang
about
in
dirty
live
in
the
eat
they
deserve
to
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
only
why
you
should
pity
be
kind
to
hope
that
some
day
they
will
wake
be
ashamed
of
their
try
to
become
something
better
once
they
do
aught
that
appears
to
the
they
work
very
hard
and
wash
very
hard
all
that
brains
may
grow
their
jaws
grow
their
ribs
come
their
tails
wither
they
will
turn
into
perhaps
after
that
into
after
that
perhaps
into
grown
know
they
daresay
you
know
you
folks
have
a
great
liking
for
those
poor
little
never
did
anybody
any
could
if
they
their
only
fault
they
do
no
more
than
some
thousands
of
their
what
with
what
with
what
with
what
with
what
with
naughty
sair
hadden
the
scotsmen
it
is
a
wonder
how
they
some
folks
help
good
bishop
they
may
have
another
make
things
fair
and
you
learn
your
thank
god
that
you
have
plenty
of
cold
water
to
wash
wash
in
it
a
true

story
is
not
better
if
i
am
not
quite
you
will
long
as
you
stick
to
hard
work
and
cold
remember
i
told
you
